Ever since I started taking those pills , my farts have become unbearably smelly ! You ’ve made it worse ! ’ “

4690	4975	4685	4685	you	0	” he calls as the doors open and I step off the elevator . The reception area is deserted , as is the cubicle field . I take off my coat and scarf , settle into my chair , and have just removed the rubber bands from the manuscript Portia gave me when from the hallway leading to the executive offices a man appears , striding confidently down the hall with a mug in his hand . He ’s in navy slacks and a crisp white dress shirt , the collar open and the sleeves rolled halfway up his strong forearms . My heart stops dead in my chest . It ’s Michael Maddox , CEO of Maddox Publishing , the most perfect man who ’s ever lived . I ’ve been in love with him for a decade . Inconveniently , he ’s married . It ’s a strange fact that no matter his pace , Michael appears to me to be always moving in slow motion , with a gentle breeze stirring his hair , a golden glow around his head . To call him beautiful would be doing him a disservice . The man is glorious . Godlike . He ’s a Michelangelo sculpture brought to life . Black hair , broad shoulders , a pair of blue eyes that could melt steel but mostly melt panties . He does , in fact , bear a striking resemblance to Superman . And he ’s headed right toward me ! My first instinct is to hide . But he ’s already seen me , so my desire to throw myself under my desk until he passes will just have to suck it . “
4981	5000	5001	5001	I	0	” He stops by my desk and smiles at me , and I swear I hear angels singing . “
5021	5064	5017	5017	you	0	” He ’s originally from London , so he has this incredibly suave British accent , which is made even more incredible as it caresses the vowels in my name . That he remembers me at all makes me quiver all over . “
5071	5104	5068	5069	Mr. Maddox	81	” Thank you , God , for allowing me to sound like a human being and not the screaming playground of kindergarten children that I am inside . He quirks his lips . “
5119	5150	5151	5151	Michael	61	” I nearly faint . Not only does he remember my name , he remembers having talked to me before . Sweet baby Jesus , Christmas came early this year . “
5153	5228	5151	5151	Michael	61	” I say his name with such reverence I ’m surprised tiny confetti hearts are n’t spilling off my tongue . Do n’t be weird ! Stop staring at him ! Close your mouth ! I look down , cheeks flaming , and realize I ’m clutching the manuscript so hard my knuckles are white . I force myself to breathe , which is probably the most difficult thing I ’ve done in years . “
5239	5264	5231	5231	we	374	” Michael frowns at the death grip I ’ve got on the manuscript . I unglue my tongue from the roof of my mouth . “
5280	5309	5231	5231	we	374	” Lies , lies , all of it lies . You are one big fat liar . I wonder if his hair is as soft as it looks ? “
5319	5368	5313	5313	I	0	” His eyes — the blue of summer skies over an undiscovered tropical paradise — smile along with the rest of his face . He has little crinkle lines around them , which somehow only add to his beauty . Unlike mine , which make me look haggard . “
5379	5440	5442	5442	you	0	” As soon as the words are out , I want to stuff my fist into my mouth so I wo n’t say anything else , because I somehow managed to take an innocent expression and make it sound like I was propositioning him for sex . Which is proven beyond a doubt when Michael ’s perfectly sculpted brows lift . “
5445	5522	5442	5442	you	0	” he murmurs , sounding amused . Why am I like this ? I silently beg the universe . Why ca n’t I be a normal person ? When are you going to drop a piano on my head and put me out of my misery ? After an excruciating moment wherein Michael watches my face burn and my hands act like big pale moths fluttering helplessly around the manuscript , he takes pity on me . “
5556	5572	5543	5543	I	0	” I shake my head , too embarrassed to speak or even look at him . “
5578	5619	5543	5543	I	0	” He lifts his mug in farewell , then heads off toward the kitchen . As soon as he ’s out of sight , I slump facedown on my desk and groan . I should n’t be allowed out in public .
5740	5745	5746	5746	she	83	“ Ducky ! Ducky ! ”
5761	5786	5787	5787	She	83	“ Oh , hello , Mrs. Dinwiddle . Sorry , I did n’t see you there . I ’m a little spaced out today . ”

6000	6019	5981	5982	Mrs. Dinwiddle	83	“ No , I did n’t know that . I have n’t talked to him in a few — ”
6020	6040	6041	6041	She	85	“ And his cousin the rugby player is staying in his apartment ! They traded off , you see ? ”
6096	6177	6185	6185	she	390	“ Blessica ran into him this morning when she went to walk the dogs , and he told her the whole story ! You know how she can get anyone to talk . She told me he was this big handsome fellow , but her eyesight is n’t what it used to be , bless the poor dear . Then I saw him just moments ago , and my word ! He is n’t simply big — he ’s gargantuan ! ”

6260	6263	6253	6253	She	390	“ Commotion ? ”

6426	6462	6416	6416	She	390	“ I have n’t had that in ages . It reminds me of the time I played Lady Macbeth at the Piccadilly and I met this strapping stagehand who was studying to be a chef — ”

6855	6864	6865	6865	I	0	“ He ’s got to be kidding me , ”
7048	7053	7045	7045	I	0	“ Uh . . . ”
7060	7094	7054	7055	The Mountain	73	“ That ’s the second time I ’ve left you speechless , lass . Imagine what would happen if I dropped the towel . I ’d probably have to call you an ambulance . ”
7164	7190	7151	7151	I	0	“ Can you please turn down that music ? It ’s very loud , and I had to listen to it all night last night — ”

10997	11008	11010	11010	Michael	61	“ You seem as out of sorts as I am , ”
11016	11026	11010	11010	Michael	61	“ I hope your Saturday was better than mine . ”
11086	11097	11081	11081	Michael	61	“ Well , I ’ll let you get to it . ”
11107	11110	11104	11104	I	0	“ Yes ! ”
11123	11126	11114	11114	Michael	61	“ Sorry ? ”
11175	11187	11188	11188	I	0	“ I meant , yes , I ’m out of sorts . ”
11227	11274	11279	11279	Michael	61	“ I have n’t been sleeping well the last few nights . I have a new neighbor who ’s apparently trying to turn the rest of us in the building deaf with his music . I did n’t realize stereos could be used as torture devices . ”
11302	11311	11312	11312	I	0	“ I had a neighbor like that once . ”
11343	11349	11354	11354	his	61	“ What did you do ? ”
11379	11400	11354	11354	his	61	“ I went over to his house , explained that he was disturbing me , and asked him to stop . ”
11401	11406	11354	11354	his	61	“ And that worked ? ”
11407	11423	11424	11424	He	61	“ No , that actually made it worse . So then I beat him up . ”
11431	11452	11424	11424	He	61	“ I ’m kidding . I made a noise complaint to the police , and they took care of it . ”
11489	11498	11500	11500	Michael	61	“ That ’s probably what you should do , ”
11538	11549	11525	11526	Dear Jesus	100	“ You ’re right . I know you ’re right . ”
11571	11614	11565	11565	I	0	“ But he lives right across the hall from me , and I would n’t want to have to see him after that . He ’d know it was me who snitched on him because I ’ve already confronted him about it . ”
11626	11642	11643	11643	I	0	“ Are you worried he ’ll retaliate ? Is this guy some kind of thug ? ”
11696	11714	11688	11688	My	0	“ Well , he is a rugby player ! Who knows what the guy is capable of ! ”
11743	11780	11737	11737	his	61	“ Good God , you live next to a rugby man ? That ’s like living next to a silverback gorilla ! Definitely do n’t confront him again , Joellen . Let the authorities handle it . ”
11781	11784	11785	11785	He	61	“ Really ? ”
11789	11835	11785	11785	He	61	“ Believe me , I had my share of run - ins with the daft buggers when I was at Oxford . They ’re animals . Animals who ’re in love with themselves . Rugby players take the term egomaniac to a whole new level . ”
11845	11857	11840	11840	my	0	“ Yeah , that basically describes Cameron McGregor in a nutshell . ”
11864	11871	11840	11840	my	0	“ Your neighbor is Cameron McGregor ? ”
11879	11884	11874	11874	he	61	“ Um , yes ? ”

11904	11917	11840	11840	my	0	“ Honestly , I have no idea what team he plays for — ”
11918	11936	11874	11874	he	61	“ Six foot six , messy brown hair , built like a skyscraper , covered in tattoos ? ”
11937	11945	11946	11946	Michael	61	“ That sounds like him , yes . ”
11951	11960	11946	11946	Michael	61	“ Christ . You might want to move . ”
11965	11973	11946	11946	Michael	61	“ Oh God . That sounds bad . ”
11974	12047	12048	12048	Michael	61	“ I do n’t know how closely you follow sports , but your neighbor is all over the papers , and usually not for his performance on the pitch . Bar fights , sex scandals , being drunk and disorderly in public . . . McGregor ’s temper is almost as notorious as his women . The UK gossip rags call him Prince Pantydropper because of the sheer number of his conquests . ”
12097	12117	12118	12118	I	0	“ He ’s well on his way to earning that title on this side of the pond , too , ”
12168	12182	12161	12161	I	0	“ I hope I do n’t run into him in the hallway again . ”
12183	12191	12192	12192	Michael	61	“ Steer clear of him , Joellen . ”

12416	12433	12413	12413	I	0	“ Nothing you say could ever be offensive to me . I ’m just . . . ”
12434	12439	12413	12413	I	0	“ Out of sorts . ”
12498	12503	12504	12504	I	0	“ Yes . Exactly . ”
12510	12515	12504	12504	I	0	“ Out of sorts . ”
12516	12521	12522	12522	His	61	“ We both are . ”
12552	12563	12549	12549	he	61	“ I wish my only problem were a noisy neighbor . ”
12604	12612	12613	12613	He	61	“ Is everything . . . okay ? ”
12641	12647	12627	12627	he	61	“ I ’m getting divorced . ”

12819	12847	12804	12804	he	511	“ I ’m sorry . I do n’t know why I told you that . Nobody else knows . We have n’t even told our families yet . ”
12872	12886	12863	12863	I	0	“ You have my word I wo n’t say a thing to anyone . ”
12903	12915	12916	12916	Michael	61	“ I ’m just so sorry this is happening to you . ”
12931	12943	12916	12916	Michael	61	“ Thank you , Joellen . You ’re always so nice . ”
12996	13008	12967	12967	Michael	61	“ So , are you coming to the office holiday party ? ”

15430	15466	15423	15423	he	92	“ Practically had to peel him off me so I could take a shower . Never had a cat take a likin ’ to me so fast . Takes after his mum , I guess . ”
15525	15559	15520	15520	He	92	“ Now I know you do n’t think you ’re leavin ’ with that cat , lass , seein ’ as how I do n’t have a shepherd ’s pie in my hands . ”

17007	17040	16999	16999	Cam	95	“ So you ’re in love with this guy — who ’s married — but you ’ve never gotten together with him . . . because he does n’t know you exist ? ”
17048	17070	17041	17041	I	0	“ You make it sound like the only reason I have n’t committed adultery is because he has n’t noticed me . ”

17105	17163	17164	17164	Cam	95	“ Ugh . Semantics ! My point is that even if Michael were all over me , I ’d never do anything with a married man ! It ’s just . . . unrequited . He does n’t know how I feel about him . But even if he did , I ’d never cross that line . ”
17187	17212	17184	17184	he	95	“ That ’s a sad story , lass . No wonder you ’re always in such a bad mood every time I see you . ”

17372	17394	17357	17358	Mrs. Dinwiddle	83	“ Because she insists on remaining an ugly duckling , my dear , when she could so easily become a swan . ”

17562	17573	17574	17574	I	0	“ Stop staring at me — you’re freaking me out , ”

17618	17674	17675	17675	I	0	“ Oh , c’m on , you can tell me , lass . It ’s not like I ’ll ever meet the man . Besides , I go back to Scotland in a month when the new season starts , and you ’ll never have to see me again . Get it off your chest . ”
17690	17698	17675	17675	I	0	“ Why do you care , anyway ? ”

17903	17919	17868	17868	He	580	“ Fine . Yes , it ’s serious and has been going on for years . ”
17920	17925	17926	17926	I	0	“ How many years ? ”
17931	17940	17941	17941	He	580	“ Are you writing a book or something ? ”
17944	17956	17941	17941	He	580	“ Just gettin ’ my facts straight . Answer the question . ”
17995	18020	17988	17988	I	0	“ Ten years . Since the first day I started working at my job . Since the first minute I laid eyes on him . ”
18072	18076	18077	18077	he	580	“ And what , ”
18085	18102	18077	18077	he	580	“ is so special about him that would make you flush a decade down the toilet ? ”
18126	18132	18114	18114	I	0	“ You would n’t understand . ”
18133	18148	18153	18153	him	580	“ Aye , I would , lass . I understand obsession all too well . ”
18242	18255	18256	18256	Cam	95	“ He ’s just . . . perfect . In every way . ”
18264	18273	18256	18256	Cam	95	“ Barf . Can you be more specific ? ”
18274	18289	18256	18256	Cam	95	“ He ’s educated . Cultured . Sophisticated . Kind . Brilliant . Gorgeous . ”
18290	18293	18294	18294	I	0	“ Gorgeous ? ”
18302	18359	18294	18294	I	0	“ He looks exactly like Christopher Reeve in his Superman days . Heroic . Cleft chin and everything . And he ’s a gentleman . His manners would put the queen of England to shame . And he dresses beautifully . And he knows all about literature , and opera , and ballet , and art — ”
18360	18366	18256	18256	Cam	95	“ So he ’s gay . ”
18391	18404	18380	18380	I	0	“ He ’s not gay ! He ’s been married for years ! ”
18405	18410	18294	18294	I	0	“ To a man ? ”
18411	18437	18380	18380	I	0	“ No ! To a model , if you must know — some airheaded Amazon with a thigh gap and a twenty - inch waist ! ”
18438	18441	18442	18442	He	95	“ Huh . ”
18453	18459	18442	18442	He	95	“ So he ’s superficial . ”
18460	18465	18380	18380	I	0	“ What ? No ! ”
18466	18477	18478	18478	I	0	“ Yes , he is . Just like you are . ”
18492	18499	18501	18501	Cam	95	“ Do n’t gimme that look , ”
18508	18528	18505	18505	his	95	“ You ’re in love with some bloke based on nothing more than his résumé and his pretty face . ”
18529	18535	18481	18481	He	95	“ That is not true ! ”
18571	18583	18564	18564	Cam	95	“ No ? How many conversations have you had with him ? ”
18584	18588	18564	18564	Cam	95	“ A lot ! ”
18605	18612	18613	18613	he	95	“ That do n’t involve work , ”
18633	18649	18616	18616	I	0	“ Forget it . Your pie ’s almost ready . Take it and get lost . ”
18650	18658	18659	18659	I	0	“ The answer ’s none , right ? ”
18676	18700	18701	18701	he	95	“ And how much time have you spent with this ‘ perfect ’ man away from work ? Or work - related functions ? ”
18716	18737	18701	18701	he	95	“ You do n’t have to spend years in private conversations with someone to know they ’re a good person . ”
18738	18803	18701	18701	he	95	“ No , but one date would be a good start . It seems to me you do n’t really know anything about him other than that he ’s pretty and has rich - boy tastes . Ballet , opera , art . . . sounds like things someone who was tryin ’ real hard to impress other people would put in a bio . ”
18899	18993	18894	18894	he	95	“ I ’ve worked at his company for ten years of my life . I ’ve seen how he treats people , how he speaks to them , how he interacts with his employees , vendors , and guests . He ’s an incredible man . An exceptional man . And yes , he ’s beautiful , but it would n’t matter if he were n’t because he ’s so good . He ’d never make someone feel small , or put them down for their beliefs , or heartlessly mock their feelings . ”
19029	19077	19023	19023	I	0	“ He ’d never have sex with a stranger he met in a bar and then throw her out like garbage ! He ’d never aggravate his neighbors with loud music , or wander around half - dressed like a psychopath , or steal someone ’s cat ! ”
19078	19097	19098	19098	I	0	“ But he would marry an airheaded model with a thigh gap and a twenty - inch waist . ”
19103	19121	19098	19098	I	0	“ Oh , you ’re saying you ’re above marrying a beautiful model , is that it ? ”
19122	19125	19126	19126	he	95	“ No , ”
19134	19167	19126	19126	he	95	“ I ’m sayin ’ if he were the altruistic , benevolent demigod you make him out to be , he ’d marry a woman who more closely reflected his true heart . ”
19188	19199	19173	19173	his	95	“ Rich men marry women for their beauty every day . ”
19200	19233	19234	19234	My	0	“ Aye , they do , and those rich men are the same superficial fuckers who dump those beautiful girls once their looks fade and swap them out for a younger replacement . ”
19355	19358	19359	19359	I	0	“ Here . ”
19391	19421	19359	19359	I	0	“ Here ’s your stupid shepherd ’s pie . Now go back to Kellen ’s apartment and leave me in peace with my pathetic one - sided love story . ”
19422	19431	19432	19432	His	95	“ Never said it was pathetic , lass . ”
19444	19470	19432	19432	His	95	“ But that ’s what you think . It ’s pretty obvious you think I ’m dumb as dirt for feeling the way I do . ”
19471	19479	19480	19480	Cam	95	“ The heart wants what it wants , ”
19487	19520	19480	19480	Cam	95	“ But sometimes what you think is love is just a beautiful form of self - destruction . The worst thing in life is to give yourself away in exchange for nothing . ”
19634	19652	19653	19653	I	0	“ Well , my life is mine , and what I do with it is my business , ”
19657	19685	19653	19653	I	0	“ Now please leave . I ’m exhausted . I worked all weekend , and I have to get up early to go back in the morning . ”
19781	19798	19760	19760	He	95	“ Tell you what , lass . I ’m gon na do you a huge favor . ”
19799	19824	19764	19764	his	95	“ If the next words out of your mouth have anything to do with your penis , I will kill you where you stand . ”
19825	19844	19760	19760	He	95	“ Just hear me out before you go all doo - lally on me now , darlin ’ . ”
19858	19880	19764	19764	his	95	“ I do n’t know what doo - lally means , but what did I tell you about calling me darling ? ”
19881	19904	19905	19909	The smug , grinning bastard	592	“ You can tell what it means from the context . And I ’ll call you whatever I want . Darlin ’ . ”
19920	19942	19943	19943	He	592	“ You make me feel violent , McGregor . I wish I were a man so I could kick your ass . ”
19951	19967	19968	19968	He	592	“ Cute . But there is n’t a man alive who could kick my arse . ”
19997	20023	19983	19983	I	0	“ Listen . While you were tellin ’ your sad story about your unrequited love for pretty boy Michael , a thought crossed my mind . ”
20024	20034	20035	20035	I	0	“ Must ’ve been a long and lonely journey , ”
20038	20048	20035	20035	I	0	“ I ’m gon na help you get him . ”
20084	20092	20063	20063	he	95	“ You ’re . . . what ? ”
20093	20104	20105	20105	He	95	“ I ’m an expert at two things , lass . ”
20124	20133	20105	20105	He	95	“ Rugby , and the art of seduction . ”
20142	20155	20105	20105	He	95	“ Did your parents ever ask you to run away from home ? ”
20156	20206	20105	20105	He	95	“ Stop insultin ’ me for a minute and listen . If you really want this bloke , you ’re gon na have to play your cards right . You ca n’t come at him too hot or too cold . It ’s like Goldilocks and the three bears . ”
20207	20215	20105	20105	He	95	“ Yeah , you lost me there . ”
20216	20237	20238	20238	I	0	“ The first bowl of porridge was too salty . That ’s you , by the way — very salty . ”
20245	20258	20238	20238	I	0	“ The second bowl of porridge was too sweet . Not you . ”
20269	20280	20259	20259	I	0	“ Just get on with the damn story , McGregor . ”
20281	20304	20305	20305	I	0	“ The third bowl of porridge was just right . That ’s what you have to be for him . Just right . ”
20340	20348	20337	20337	I	0	“ You ’re a profoundly strange person . ”
20349	20361	20399	20399	his	95	“ I can teach you how to be what he wants . ”
20362	20383	20399	20399	his	95	“ Pfft ! You do n’t even know him ! How could you possibly teach me to be what he — ”
20384	20395	20396	20396	he	95	“ I know men even better than I know women , ”
20403	20415	20399	20399	his	95	“ And I know exactly what makes pretty rich boys tick . ”
20425	20445	20446	20446	He	95	“ That sounds a little ominous . Is there a story of dubious sexual consent lurking behind that statement ? ”
20458	20494	20446	20446	He	95	“ Bein ’ in a fishbowl , living like I do , you ’re exposed to every kind of person there is . Over the years , I ’ve sorta become a student of humanity . ”
20508	20525	20526	20526	He	95	“ You ? A student of humanity ? The guy who prances around in yellow tights ? ”
20541	20562	20526	20526	He	95	“ You see ? You are superficial . You only look at what ’s right in front of your face . ”
20582	20595	20575	20575	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to be rude . ”
20596	20601	20602	20602	he	95	“ Aye , lass , ”
20606	20610	20602	20602	he	95	“ you did . ”
20615	20654	20612	20612	he	95	“ But I can take it because I ’m not your sensitive pretty boy lover , who ’d probably burst into tears if he got a gander at the dragon that hides under that unassuming exterior of yours . ”
20664	20678	20612	20612	he	95	“ Unassuming . That ’s a polite way of calling me a dog . ”
20687	20706	20679	20679	Cam	95	“ You ’re not a dog , darlin ’ . You ’re just not doin’ yourself any favors . ”
20707	20724	20725	20725	His	95	“ Jesus , between you and Mrs. Dinwiddle , my inferiority complex should reach new heights ! ”
20753	20764	20750	20750	He	95	“ You ’ve nothin’ to feel inferior about , idiot . ”
20765	20796	20800	20800	his	95	“ So we went from darling to idiot in the space of a few minutes . Excuse me while I go get my neck brace . I ’m getting whiplash . ”
20819	20849	20805	20805	He	95	“ Suit yourself . Do n’t take my help . But do n’t come cryin ’ to me when pretty boy keeps right on not knowin ’ you exist . ”
20850	20856	20805	20805	He	95	“ Stop calling him that ! ”
20857	20888	20889	20889	He	95	“ Stop pretending you ’re a mouse , dragon lady , and go after what you want . In fifty years , we ’ll all be dead . Carpe diem . ”

21620	21629	21611	21611	He	604	“ Is there a Joellen Bixby around here ? ”
21630	21634	21611	21611	He	604	“ Right there . ”
21707	21720	21721	21721	He	604	“ Man , that sucker ’s heavy . Sign here , please . ”
21786	21794	21796	21796	Shasta	121	“ Well , who ’s it from ? ”
21858	21865	21867	21867	Shasta	121	“ So what does it say ? ”

22265	22277	22278	22278	I	0	“ I asked Mrs. Dinwiddle . Did you get the flowers ? ”
22294	22310	22278	22278	I	0	“ Yes . And your charming note . Shakespeare you ’re not , my friend . ”
22311	22321	22243	22243	you	95	“ Oh ho ! So we ’re friends now ! ”
22322	22341	22243	22243	you	95	“ No . I ’d still like to push you into traffic . Why ’re you calling me ? ”
22342	22352	22353	22353	I	0	“ To discuss phase one of Operation Pretty Boy . ”
22361	22371	22372	22372	He	615	“ Give me a slight break , would you ? ”
22379	22406	22372	22372	He	615	“ I ’ve already kicked things into gear with the flowers . If you ’re on his radar at all , that ’ll pique his interest . ”
22407	22422	22423	22423	He	615	“ Pique ? Did Cameron McGregor just use the word pique in a sentence ? ”
22426	22455	22423	22423	He	615	“ You ’ll be happy to know , darlin ’ , that Cameron McGregor has an exceptional vocabulary . Extraordinary , anomalous , remarkable , and preternaturally unprecedented . ”

22856	22891	22892	22892	Cam	95	“ I do n’t have a mink coat and a silk fan handy . A girl needs props to make that kind of Scarlett O’Hara routine work . He ’ll think I ’m lame ! ”
22895	22911	22892	22892	Cam	95	“ He ’ll think you ’re mysterious . The less you say , the better . ”

23682	23692	23676	23676	she	121	“ Thank you . Blue ’s my favorite color . ”
23693	23698	23700	23700	Michael	61	“ Mine , too , ”
23742	23757	23731	23731	He	61	“ That ’s quite the enormous bouquet . Is it your birthday , Joellen ? ”
23793	23803	23785	23785	I	0	“ Oh , no , those are just from — ”
23835	23840	23841	23841	I	0	“ coy as shit , ”
23863	23867	23860	23860	I	0	“ A friend . ”
23989	24008	23982	23982	her	121	“ I guess it did n’t turn out to be such a bad weekend for you after all . ”
24033	24045	24046	24046	Denny	77	“ Let me get rid of this for you , kiddo . ”
24075	24080	24065	24065	He	77	“ Ta - da ! ”
24081	24097	24065	24065	He	77	“ Thank you . That ’s great . It looks very . . . ergonomic . ”
24217	24233	24209	24209	he	77	“ Did I tell you the one about Bill Gates farting in the Apple store ? ”
24234	24245	24246	24246	Michael	61	“ That will be all , Denny , thank you . ”
24283	24301	24302	24302	He	77	“ Oh yes , of course . Sorry , Mr. Maddox . I ’ll be off now . ”
24356	24369	24348	24348	I	0	“ Um , thanks for the chair . I really appreciate it . ”
24370	24400	24403	24403	his	77	“ You ’re welcome . Let me know if there ’s anything else you need , Joellen . I want to make sure you ’re well taken care of . ”
24471	24485	24460	24460	Michael	61	“ Well . I ’m back to work . Have a good day . ”
24523	24537	24516	24516	Shasta	121	“ Did someone drug my coffee , or was he flirting with you ? ”
24570	24578	24558	24558	she	121	“ Pinch me . I ’m dreaming . ”
24586	24615	24583	24583	her	121	“ Bitch , I ’ll do more than pinch you . If Michael Maddox has the hots for you , I ’ll punch you right in the face . ”
24767	24798	24799	24799	He	634	“ Cool skirt , prancer . You look groovy in plaid . When ’re you going to invest in some shirts ? You do realize it ’s winter , right ? ”
24817	24825	24799	24799	He	634	“ It ’s a kilt , lass . ”
24855	24861	24870	24870	I	0	“ What ’s the difference ? ”
24862	24868	24870	24870	I	0	“ What you wear underneath . ”
24878	24888	24875	24875	he	634	“ Ask me what I ’m wearin ’ underneath . ”
24889	24906	24907	24907	He	634	“ I feel like this is a trick to get me to look at your junk . ”
24911	24936	24907	24907	He	634	“ My ‘ junk ’ ? Cameron McGregor does n’t have ‘ junk . ’ He has family jewels , thank you very much . ”
24951	24988	24989	24989	He	634	“ Yeah , well your family jewels can stay safely under your skirt , buddy , because I ’m in too good a mood to deal with a random penis sighting , thank you very much . ”
25006	25025	25026	25026	I	0	“ You sure ? It ’s a life - changin ’ event , I promise you , lass . ”
25029	25057	25026	25026	I	0	“ No doubt , but I do n’t have the cash to bankroll the long and expensive relationship with a psychotherapist that seeing you naked would necessitate . ”
25058	25069	25101	25101	his	634	“ Aha ! You admit it would blow your mind ! ”
25070	25098	25099	25099	He	634	“ I admit that I ’ve seen people like you before , but I ’ve had to pay an entry fee at the circus to do so . ”
25110	25143	25101	25101	his	634	“ Just make it easier on yourself , darlin ’ , and admit you ’re wild for me and are dyin ’ to bring a few dozen little McGregors into the world . ”
25144	25149	25101	25101	his	634	“ You ’re delusional . ”
25150	25159	25101	25101	his	634	“ You ’re massively in love with me . ”
25160	25169	25101	25101	his	634	“ I ’m massively in dislike with you . ”
25170	25185	25101	25101	his	634	“ You ’ve finally figured out I ’m the real man of your dreams . ”
25186	25204	25205	25205	We	636	“ I ’ve finally figured out how you got here . Someone left your cage door open . ”
25227	25247	25101	25101	his	634	“ You look awful cheery , lass . Did your lingerie store have a sale on beige granny panties ? ”
25261	25280	25295	25295	He	639	“ I just wanted to tell you that you ’re a genius . I think the roses worked . ”
25317	25323	25295	25295	He	639	“ Aye ? What happened ? ”
25330	25350	25324	25324	I	0	“ Whoa . Your ability to go from harmless flirt to serial killer is mutant , you know that ? ”
25351	25362	25363	25363	He	639	“ Do n’t kid yourself . I ’m never harmless . ”
25425	25474	25475	25475	He	639	“ Okeydokey . You ’re never harmless . Congratulations on being a psychopath . By the way , why ’s your music so loud ? You said , and I quote , ‘ Your pie for my silence . ’ That ear - splitting noise is hardly silence . ”
25512	25515	25506	25506	biceps	645	“ guns . ”
25530	25553	25554	25554	I	0	“ That pie you made me yesterday bought my silence yesterday . You want more silence today ? I want another pie . ”
25559	25577	25554	25554	I	0	“ You never said that ! You ca n’t change the rules after we made an agreement ! ”
25578	25589	25590	25590	He	639	“ Cameron McGregor can do whatever he likes , lass . ”
25602	25605	25606	25606	He	639	“ Wait ! ”
25616	25631	25632	25632	He	639	“ I do n’t have the ingredients for another shepherd ’s pie , but — ”
25648	25669	25640	25640	I	0	“ But I can make you my grandmother ’s meat loaf , you big jerk ! It ’s even better ! ”
25694	25698	25687	25687	Cameron	92	“ Meat loaf ? ”
25699	25702	25703	25703	I	0	“ Yes , ”
25708	25724	25703	25703	I	0	“ Meat loaf . A loaf made of meat . It ’s friggin ’ delicious . ”
25731	25737	25738	25738	he	639	“ What kind of meat ? ”
25750	25754	25755	25755	He	639	“ Ground turkey . ”
25789	25816	25817	25817	He	639	“ It ’s fluffy , juicy , and comes with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy . Do you want the dang thing or not ? ”
25842	25846	25847	25847	He	639	“ All right . ”
25851	25881	25847	25847	He	639	“ I accept this loaf of meat you offer . But if I discover that you ’ve exaggerated its claims of greatness , our deal is null and void . ”
25896	25905	25906	25906	I	0	“ I ’ll show you null and void , ”
25984	25994	25995	25995	I	0	“ No , McGregor . No . Get out . ”
26034	26054	26009	26009	He	92	“ You can tell me all about pretty boy Michael and what a genius I am while you cook . ”
26119	26133	26134	26134	he	92	“ If looks could kill , I ’d be stone dead , lass , ”
26169	26180	26163	26163	I	0	“ You ’re the reason God created the middle finger . ”
26232	26242	26220	26220	I	0	“ I ’m happy you find me so amusing . ”
26248	26259	26243	26243	He	92	“ That ’s not exactly the word I ’d use . ”
26283	26299	26272	26272	I	0	“ You know , I was in a really good mood before I got home . ”
26300	26314	26333	26333	he	92	“ Because my roses worked . By the way , you ’re welcome . ”
26338	26359	26333	26333	he	92	“ Well . . . yes . And thank you . How much do I owe you for that bouquet ? ”
26360	26384	26385	26385	He	92	“ A week of shepherd ’s pies . And / or loafs of meat , if this one turns out to be acceptable . ”
26399	26429	26385	26385	He	92	“ It ’s a drop in the ocean compared to what a Manhattan florist charges for one hundred roses , darlin ’ . But it ’s up to you . ”
26495	26510	26481	26481	I	0	“ That includes no music for a week , too , though , right ? ”
26511	26524	26525	26525	I	0	“ Sure . But it also includes me eatin ’ over here . ”
26529	26535	26536	26536	He	92	“ Here ? Why here ? ”
26550	26556	26563	26563	him	92	“ I like your cat . ”
26572	26589	26563	26563	him	92	“ Wo n’t that interfere with your naked poker parties and standing door sex with strangers ? ”
26596	26609	26593	26593	his	92	“ No , I ’ll just move those to the mornin ’s . ”
26638	26669	26670	26670	He	92	“ So to clarify , the deal is seven home - cooked meals , which you eat here , in exchange for payment on the roses and no loud music . ”
26683	26689	26672	26672	his	92	“ And that ’s it ? ”
26690	26707	26708	26708	His	92	“ I can throw in a daily viewin ’ of the family jewels if you like . ”
26729	26757	26758	26758	He	92	“ No , thank you . But it occurs to me that we should discuss exactly how long it will take you to eat your meals here . ”
26763	26779	26760	26760	his	92	“ You want a time limit , lass ? That ’s a trifle insultin ’ . ”
26780	26797	26708	26708	His	92	“ I just want to make sure you do n’t end up sleeping on my couch . ”
26798	26806	26807	26807	I	0	“ What if you invite me to ? ”
26815	26820	26807	26807	I	0	“ McGregor , honestly ! ”
26821	26871	26872	26872	I	0	“ It ’s a legitimate question . I ’ve been told I ’m irresistible often enough to believe it . You could very well wind up throwin ’ yourself at me , darlin ’ , and then where would we be ? Just clarifyin ’ , like you said . ”
26909	26915	26906	26906	I	0	“ Twenty minutes a night . ”
26922	26952	26906	26906	I	0	“ I ’m not a competitive eater , lass , you ca n’t expect me to shovel an entire pie down my throat in less than half an hour . ”
26953	26959	26906	26906	I	0	“ Fine . Thirty minutes . ”
26960	26964	26906	26906	I	0	“ One hour . ”
26965	26971	26972	26972	He	92	“ Forty - five minutes . ”
27000	27008	26972	26972	He	92	“ Forty - five minutes . Deal . ”
27023	27041	27047	27047	me	0	“ Deal . Now sit there , and try not to be annoying while I make dinner . ”
27110	27125	27100	27100	Cameron	92	“ Jesus ! You scared me half to death ! What ’re you doing ? ”
27126	27143	27144	27144	He	92	“ Did you forget I was here , lass ? Is your attention span that short ? ”
27185	27201	27166	27166	I	0	“ Get over there ! Go sit down at the table , and stop looming ! ”
27202	27209	27210	27210	he	92	“ Christ , you ’re bossy , ”
27299	27306	27284	27284	I	0	“ Can you please cover yourself ? ”
27307	27311	27312	27312	He	92	“ With this ? ”
27338	27352	27335	27335	he	92	“ Is the sight of my manly bare chest distracting you , sweetheart ? ”
27360	27375	27353	27353	I	0	“ Forty - five minutes of this every night and I ’ll go insane . ”
27376	27382	27335	27335	he	92	“ Aye . With lust . ”
27383	27390	27353	27353	I	0	“ Oh . My . God . ”
27391	27414	27415	27415	I	0	“ You can just call me Cam , darlin ’ . Though it ’s accurate , God seems a wee bit formal . ”
27457	27466	27454	27454	he	92	“ So . Pretty boy . Tell me . ”
27518	27549	27514	27514	Cam	95	“ It was brilliant . He came over first thing in the morning to see about the chair he ordered me , and there ’s this huge bouquet on my — ”
27550	27554	27555	27555	I	0	“ What chair ? ”
27565	27587	27555	27555	I	0	“ Oh . He thought my office chair was broken because I was being my usual clumsy self and . . . ”
27604	27620	27595	27595	I	0	“ I mean , he thought my chair was broken and ordered me another one . ”
27621	27630	27514	27514	Cam	95	“ This was before he saw the roses ? ”
27631	27655	27562	27562	his	95	“ Yeah . This was during the conversation I had with him on Sunday , when I found out he was getting divorced . ”
27656	27677	27595	27595	I	0	“ When you say he thought it was broken , that makes it sound like it was n’t actually broken . ”
27678	27719	27720	27720	Cam	95	“ It was n’t . It ’s hard to explain without getting you mad , because I ’ll have to describe what happened , and honestly I do n’t see any way around that without mentioning that I ’m clumsy . ”
27726	27729	27720	27720	Cam	95	“ Huh . ”
27730	27739	27595	27595	I	0	“ What d’you mean , ‘ huh ’ ? ”
27740	27748	27720	27720	Cam	95	“ There ’s two parts to it . ”
27749	27761	27720	27720	Cam	95	“ There ’s two parts to a one - syllable word ? ”
27762	27767	27595	27595	I	0	“ To the explanation . ”
27768	27781	27782	27782	Cam	95	“ Why do I feel like I should be sitting for this ? ”
27814	27832	27811	27811	Cam	95	“ Part one is the interestin ’ fact that pretty boy ordered you a new office chair . ”
27840	27846	27833	27833	I	0	“ Why is that interesting ? ”
27847	27906	27907	27907	I	0	“ Interestin ’ that he noticed . Interestin ’ that he took the initiative . Interestin ’ that he made it happen so fast . Interestin ’ that he dropped by to make sure it was done . All of it made even more interestin ’ because you ’re of the opinion he does n’t know you exist . ”
27915	27922	27907	27907	I	0	“ That ’s what I thought ! ”
27923	27934	27833	27833	I	0	“ What did he do when he saw the flowers ? ”
27935	27954	27907	27907	I	0	“ He sort of . . . glared at them , like he wanted to throw them away . ”
27968	27974	27964	27964	he	95	“ What ’s part two ? ”
27975	27991	27992	27992	I	0	“ That you care if I get mad when you ’re too hard on yourself . ”
28005	28016	27997	27997	I	0	“ So , what do you think it all means ? ”
28017	28026	28036	28036	he	95	“ I think it means he likes you . ”
28050	28064	28043	28043	I	0	“ Much as I ’d love to believe that , I ca n’t . ”
28065	28077	27997	27997	I	0	“ Maybe you should take my word for it , lass . ”
28078	28099	28100	28100	Cam	95	“ This from the man wearing nothing but a plaid skirt who insists I ’m desperate to have his babies . ”
28109	28133	28100	28100	Cam	95	“ Aye . And what bonny wee bairns they ’d be , too . Pretty little devils with their mum ’s salty tongue . ”
28134	28144	27997	27997	I	0	“ Being around you is slightly exhausting , McGregor . ”
28145	28160	28161	28161	I	0	“ Only slightly ? I ’m takin ’ that as a compliment , lass . ”
28218	28222	28223	28223	Cam	95	“ You see ? ”
28227	28244	28223	28223	Cam	95	“ You ’re mad about me . Only a woman in love can laugh like that . ”
28258	28275	28223	28223	Cam	95	“ You were dropped on your head a lot as a baby , were n’t you ? ”
28276	28282	28283	28283	he	95	“ Not as a baby , ”
28294	28299	28283	28283	he	95	“ That came later . ”
28360	28371	28372	28372	he	95	“ I can hear the gears turnin ’ , lass , ”
28379	28392	28372	28372	he	95	“ Do n’t break your brain — just go ahead and ask . ”
28393	28406	28372	28372	he	95	“ Um . Sheesh . I do n’t know where to start . ”
28415	28425	28411	28411	I	0	“ You . . . had a rough childhood ? ”
28431	28442	28426	28426	He	95	“ Do n’t tell me you have n’t googled me . ”
28443	28458	28476	28476	his	95	“ Of course I have n’t googled you ! Why would I do that ? ”
28459	28470	28476	28476	his	95	“ Because I ’m Cameron McGregor , that ’s why . ”
28531	28554	28555	28555	He	95	“ Okay , not to be mean , but I literally had never heard of you until you moved into my building . ”
28560	28572	28557	28557	his	95	“ Do n’t be daft . Everyone ’s heard of me . ”
28573	28582	28557	28557	his	95	“ Dude . You ’re not Mick Jagger . ”
28583	28596	28557	28557	his	95	“ No , I ’m much more famous and better - looking . ”
28597	28604	28605	28605	He	95	“ No , you ’re not . ”
28626	28648	28618	28618	He	95	“ You ’re saying you think Mick bloody Jagger , that grizzled old Englishman , is better - looking than me ? ”
28649	28675	28676	28676	He	95	“ Easy , tiger . Do n’t get your skirt in a bunch . I ’m saying you ’re not as famous as Mick Jagger . ”
28711	28730	28708	28708	his	95	“ You ’re sadly misinformed , darlin ’ . I ’m the most famous athlete on the planet . ”
28731	28761	28762	28762	He	95	“ Okay , number one , rock stars are more famous than athletes , hands down . And number two , you ’re not more famous than Michael Jordan . ”
28770	28780	28762	28762	He	95	“ I ’m way more famous than Michael Jordan ! ”
28781	28803	28804	28804	His	95	“ Maybe in your own mind , but here in the land of the sane people , you ’re definitely not . ”
28817	28830	28804	28804	His	95	“ Ach , lassie , you really do n’t get out enough . ”
28831	28873	28874	28874	He	95	“ On a side note to this stupid conversation , McGregor , here in the States , Lassie is a famous television dog . So when I hear you call me lassie , I ’m hearing you call me a dog . ”
28881	28887	28874	28874	He	95	“ What kind of dog ? ”
28888	28894	28804	28804	His	95	“ Oh , sweet Jesus . ”
28895	28932	28804	28804	His	95	“ I ’m bein ’ serious ! Is it a pretty dog ? A mangy dog ? A pit bull ? I ’ve never heard of this Lassie character . You need to clue me in . ”
28933	28965	28966	28966	He	95	“ You were kicked out of Scotland because you ’re so annoying , right ? Everyone got together and agreed to throw you out for the greater good of the country ? ”
28978	28987	28974	28974	his	95	“ You ’d know if you googled me . ”
28988	28997	28804	28804	His	95	“ I am not googling you , egosaurus . ”
28998	29014	29015	29015	I	0	“ C’m on , you know you want to . We can do it together ! ”
29024	29035	29015	29015	I	0	“ You have serious mental problems that require professional help . ”
29041	29058	29036	29036	His	95	“ All part o ’ my charm , sweetheart , all part o ’ my charm . ”
29101	29109	29093	29093	Cam	95	“ Oh , shut up , McGregor . ”
29110	29140	29141	29141	He	95	“ Never in a million years , lass . I ’ve got too many brilliant ideas to share . Like this one , for instance . Are you ready ? ”
29161	29167	29149	29149	he	95	“ I can hardly wait . ”
29168	29184	29185	29185	I	0	“ First , a question : When was the last time you kissed a man ? ”
29192	29196	29185	29185	I	0	“ Screw you ! ”
29197	29236	29149	29149	he	95	“ I ’m not insinuatin ’ you ’re a lesbian , if that ’s what you think . Not that there ’s anything wrong with bein ’ a lesbian — that just was n’t where I was headed . ”
29237	29274	29275	29275	He	95	“ You ’re so lucky the knives are in a drawer on the other side of the kitchen , because if I had one in my hand right now , I ’d gouge out your eyeballs . ”
29284	29318	29319	29319	I	0	“ My point is that if it ’s been a while since you were properly kissed , you ’ll need a little practice to get yourself up to speed for pretty boy Michael . ”
29322	29331	29319	29319	I	0	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
29341	29352	29332	29332	Cam	95	“ I ’m talkin ’ about bein ’ your coach . ”
29371	29384	29385	29385	His	95	“ Wait . You ’re offering to teach me how to kiss ? ”
29391	29398	29385	29385	His	95	“ Who better than Prince Pantydropper ? ”
29428	29435	29436	29436	He	95	“ Oh , I get it . ”
29440	29447	29436	29436	He	95	“ You get what , exactly ? ”
29448	29553	29554	29554	Cam	95	“ You ’re one of those guys who ca n’t stand it when a woman is n’t into him . Your ego is so inflated with the hot gas everyone blows up your butt , when you cross paths with someone who ’s indifferent , it drives you crazy . So you have to walk around half - naked showing off your collection of bulges and tattoos , and demand homemade meat loaves , and make outrageous statements like ‘ I ’ll be your kissing coach , ’ all so that your fragile yet ridiculously overblown ego wo n’t implode from lack of attention . ”
29557	29569	29554	29554	Cam	95	“ Thank you , Dr. Freud , for that excellent diagnosis . ”
29570	29575	29620	29620	he	95	“ You ’re welcome . ”
29576	29609	29620	29620	he	95	“ Too bad it ’s barmy . But I ’m interested in hearin ’ more about these ‘ bulges ’ you speak of . Are there any in particular that’re your favorites ? ”
29636	29667	29620	29620	he	95	“ I bet it ’s even more aggravating to you that the chubby girl is the one who ’s not all hot and bothered by your flagrant machismo , right ? ”
29696	29724	29687	29687	He	95	“ Tear yourself down in front of me again , woman , and I ’ll take you over my knee and make you wish you had n’t . ”
29761	29769	29770	29770	Cam	95	“ Why ’re your lips twitchin ’ ? ”
29777	29798	29772	29772	his	95	“ Because I ’m trying to decide if that ’s sweet , sexist , or so ridiculous I should laugh . ”
29819	29830	29810	29810	He	95	“ That ’s easy , lass . It ’s sweet . ”
29837	29846	29810	29810	He	95	“ Question . Purely for curiosity ’s sake . ”
29847	29850	29810	29810	He	95	“ Shoot . ”
29851	29865	29867	29867	his	95	“ Have you ever actually taken a woman over your knee as punishment ? ”
29878	29891	29872	29872	I	0	“ Nope . Never mind . I do n’t want to know . ”
29913	29918	29903	29903	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
29919	29924	29925	29925	Cam	95	“ Ugh . Headache . ”
29930	29953	29925	29925	Cam	95	“ I know you think I ’m irritatin ’ , but causin ’ an actual headache is on a whole other level . ”
29954	29979	29980	29980	Cam	95	“ It ’s not you . I mean it is you , but it ’s mainly because I have n’t eaten anything all day . ”
29983	29990	29991	29991	I	0	“ Why the bloody hell not ? ”
29994	30007	29991	29991	I	0	“ Oh , thanks for that . Shouting is great for headaches . ”
30008	30015	29980	29980	Cam	95	“ Do n’t avoid the question ! ”
30029	30047	30025	30025	Cam	95	“ This better not have anythin ’ to do with pretty boy and the office holiday party . ”
30115	30125	30103	30103	I	0	“ My stomach has just been a little upset . ”
30134	30142	30143	30143	He	95	“ You lie for shit , woman . ”
30165	30174	30158	30158	him	95	“ What makes you think I ’m lying ? ”
30175	30182	30183	30183	I	0	“ Student of humanity , remember ? ”
30199	30236	30183	30183	I	0	“ Okay , your face gets all scrunched up and your whole body does this cringy , foldin’-in - on - itself thing . You might as well be wearin ’ a sign on your forehead . ”
30237	30242	30243	30243	Cam	95	“ That is inconvenient . ”
30254	30265	30251	30251	his	95	“ No , lass . It ’s a good thing . ”
30273	30280	30267	30267	his	95	“ But starvation diets are not . ”
30281	30296	30183	30183	I	0	“ Could you please be less observant ? It ’s making my headache worse . ”
30297	30350	30351	30351	I	0	“ No , and tough . A headache is the price you pay for bein ’ a bloody idiot . Your body needs fuel , lass , and if it does n’t get it , it ’ll start to cannibalize your muscles , and then you ’ll have worse problems than headaches . ”
30354	30362	30351	30351	I	0	“ What ’re you , a doctor ? ”
30393	30405	30390	30390	Cam	95	“ Look at me , lass . Look at this body . ”
30423	30455	30406	30406	He	95	“ You think I got this perfect physique by starvin ’ myself ? You think I became the world ’s most famous , beloved athlete by tryin ’ to be skinny ? ”
30456	30474	30409	30409	his	95	“ I ’m sorry , could you repeat the question ? Your ego is blocking my ears . ”
30475	30499	30406	30406	He	95	“ The human body is a complex machine . A temple , as they say . You have to treat it like one ! ”
30500	30528	30409	30409	his	95	“ Yeah , well , my temple is more like an abandoned ruin the jungle has taken over and a herd of billy goats is living in . ”
30582	30594	30567	30567	she	56	“ What you need is a customized diet and exercise program . ”
30595	30604	30605	30605	He	95	“ Incorrect . What I need is liposuction . ”
30655	30675	30645	30645	Cam	95	“ No lipo . Your body will burn fat efficiently if you feed it properly and work it out . ”
30676	30728	30729	30729	Cam	95	“ Hooray . Unfortunately , I ’m addicted to carbs and sugar and allergic to exercise , so the only way I ’m going to burn fat is if someone comes at me with a blowtorch or if I stop eating altogether . I decided I ’d try option two first . ”
30762	30771	30759	30759	he	95	“ We start trainin ’ tomorrow mornin ’ . ”
30776	30803	30772	30772	I	0	“ I ’m not taking you up on your kissing coaching , pal , no matter how many panties you ’ve dropped ! Let it go . ”
30820	30830	30806	30806	his	95	“ I ’m talkin ’ about an exercise program . ”
30831	30852	30853	30853	I	0	“ Ha ! Me adopting an exercise routine is about as likely as you suddenly developing humility and fashion sense . ”
30873	30885	30886	30886	he	95	“ How much weight do you wanna lose by the party ? ”
30903	30957	30896	30896	I	0	“ A literal ton . And if you can add in glowing skin and a pair of boobs that do n’t look like something out of National Geographic , lengthen my legs by a few inches , and generally reduce my resemblance to the ogress Princess Fiona from Shrek , you ’re on . ”
31036	31046	31047	31047	He	95	“ Please do n’t bristle at me , McGregor . ”
31064	31076	31055	31055	he	95	“ Who . Told . You . You ’re . Ugly . ”
31077	31086	31055	31055	he	95	“ Every mirror I ’ve ever looked into . ”
31119	31133	31114	31114	his	138	“ Stop , McGregor . Just stop . I know how I look . ”
31134	31141	31114	31114	his	138	“ Maybe you need new glasses . ”
31175	31270	31171	31171	I	0	“ Do n’t you dare pity me or patronize me . And do n’t bullshit me , either . I own mirrors , and a scale , and have a younger sister who ’s won enough beauty contests that I know what pretty is supposed to look like . And I ’m not it . Which is fine — I’m not feeling sorry for myself . But when someone like you who ’s physically gifted tries to be kind about my appearance , it comes off as really disingenuous and honestly kind of cruel . ”
31337	31363	31332	31332	Cam	95	“ I do n’t pity you , Joellen . And I ’m a lot of things , but a bullshitter is n’t one of ’em . ”
31382	31387	31379	31379	Cam	95	“ Look at me . ”
31388	31421	31379	31379	Cam	95	“ I ’m too mad to look at you . Now be quiet before I take the meat loaf out of the oven and shove it up your stuck - up butt . ”
31431	31458	31428	31428	Cam	95	“ Y’know , lass , in some cultures when a woman constantly threatens a man with violence , it ’s a sure sign she likes him . ”
31473	31488	31467	31467	my	0	“ You ’re relentless . Also that ’s a totally made - up fact . ”
31489	31524	31525	31525	I	0	“ I ’m sure I read it somewhere , but here ’s a fact that is n’t made up . If you wanna look different for pretty boy , I ’m your best shot . ”
31550	31580	31586	31586	he	95	“ I was a runt as a boy , lass . The incredibly delectable body you see before you is self - made , forged from nothin’ but will . ”
31598	31643	31586	31586	he	95	“ This majestic display of manhood did n’t just happen . Cameron McGregor was n’t carved by Michelangelo ’s hand like the David . He was carved by his own . I ’m sure you ’ll agree , the results are even more spectacular . ”
31644	31663	31586	31586	he	95	“ Sorry , I think I just vomited a little in my mouth . What were you saying ? ”
31683	31688	31671	31671	his	95	“ Gimme your hand . ”
31697	31724	31725	31725	He	95	“ If you ’re thinking of giving me a tactile tour of other parts of your majestic manhood , you can go jump off a cliff . ”
31789	31823	31782	31782	he	95	“ When it comes to the body , I know what I ’m doin’ , lass . Gimme a chance to show you what I mean . I promise you ’ll be satisfied . ”

32127	32133	32124	32125	my mother	287	“ Why are you shouting ? ”
32134	32152	32157	32157	Cam	95	“ Oh , sorry , uh . . . I have my music on a little loud . ”
32184	32195	32175	32175	she	287	“ Who ’s that ? Is someone there with you ? ”
32215	32220	32201	32201	I	0	“ Just my neighbor . ”
32221	32225	32196	32196	Avoiding	141	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle ? ”
32268	32277	32265	32265	I	0	“ No , he ’s a new neighbor . ”
32296	32299	32292	32293	my mother	287	“ He ? ”
32387	32402	32375	32375	I	0	“ Do n’t start knitting baby booties yet , mother . He ’s gay . ”
32411	32427	32428	32428	I	0	“ Tell her my name and see what she says about me bein ’ gay . ”
32431	32435	32428	32428	I	0	“ Shut up ! ”
32440	32453	32428	32428	I	0	“ What did he say ? What ’s going on over there ? ”
32466	32477	32436	32437	My mother	287	“ My neighbor ’s just giving me some decorating advice . ”
32478	32497	32498	32498	Cam	95	“ Oh , how nice ! Maybe he can help you with your wardrobe , too , sweetie . ”
32531	32550	32523	32523	bastard!—he	142	“ Hullo , Mrs. Bixby . This is Cameron McGregor . Your daughter and I are in love . ”
32592	32595	32596	32596	he	95	“ Aye , ”
32608	32613	32596	32596	he	95	“ That Cameron McGregor . ”
32635	32645	32646	32646	he	95	“ Oh , your husband ’s a big fan ? ”
32653	32672	32646	32646	he	95	“ That ’s great to hear . Is he home ? I ’d love to talk to him . ”
32673	32688	32689	32689	Cam	95	“ Give me the phone , you big ape ! Give it to me ! ”
32790	32811	32812	32812	My	0	“ Hullo , sir . Aye , your wife was just telling me — yessir , it ’s really me . ”
32822	32853	32812	32812	My	0	“ No , no , nothin’ permanent . My cousin and I traded flats for the holidays . I needed a change of scenery , you could say . . . ”

32912	32929	32930	32930	He	95	“ Aye , it was a bang - up season . No injuries , touch wood . ”
32935	32943	32930	32930	He	95	“ You get the matches on cable ? ”
32953	32962	32930	32930	He	95	“ You can count on it , sir . ”
32979	32986	32964	32964	he	95	“ So I ’m discoverin ’ . ”
32995	33007	32991	32991	he	95	“ Actually I know several lads who think she ’s quite — ”

33171	33182	33183	33184	my father	677	“ I ca n’t believe that was really Cameron McGregor ! ”
33198	33215	33183	33184	my father	677	“ Wait’ll I tell the guys at the club — they’ll totally flip out . Epic . ”
33307	33314	33315	33315	I	0	“ So he actually is famous , ”
33330	33335	33336	33337	My father	677	“ Are you kidding ? ”

33361	33396	33397	33398	My father	677	“ Because I hate organized sports and everyone who plays organized sports and would rather burn my eyes out with acid than be forced to watch or read anything to do with organized sports . ”

33659	33694	33645	33645	She	699	“ Is he as gorgeous in person as he is in photos ? Is he really as muscular as he looks on TV ? What about his hair ? Does he have good ha — ”
33695	33710	33728	33729	my mother	287	“ Mother . Focus . He ’s a person , not a sex object . ”
33734	33774	33728	33729	my mother	287	“ I ’m sorry , we seem to have a bad connection . I thought I just heard my daughter say that Cameron McGregor , the sex object to end all sex objects , is not a sex object . ”
33789	33815	33816	33816	Her	287	“ He ’s actually pretty smart , if you want the truth . He ’s very intuitive , and he ’s got an amazing vocabulary . ”

34840	34874	34831	34831	Cam	95	“ Yep . It ’s an old Scottish tradition . A draught of poison just after wakin ’ . If it does n’t kill you , it ’ll put hair on your chest . ”

37929	37942	37944	37944	Ruth	153	“ Obviously the position is at a higher pay grade , Joellen , ”
37946	37977	37944	37944	Ruth	153	“ so since you ’ve been approved for a raise , if you got the job , you ’d get a bump from the starting salary to reflect your raise . ”

38958	38989	38990	38990	I	0	“ Why do you use the word gorgeous to describe a man who ’s had so much plastic surgery he looks like he was created for Madame Tussauds wax museum ? ”
38996	39004	38990	38990	I	0	“ Are you referring to Michael Maddox ? ”

40153	40190	40139	40139	He	95	“ McGregor , your imagination is almost as overactive as mine . There ’s no conspiracy here , you big lug ! It ’s just an open position ! People leave their jobs all the time ! ”

40229	40273	40216	40216	I	0	“ So this is interesting . I ’m discovering new aspects to your personality every day . Giant ego , check . Fetish for tight leg wear and bad music , check . Ingrained suspicion of good luck and active paranoia , check . ”

47898	47971	47892	47892	his	95	“ Do n’t be naïve . If that woman wants to , she can make big problems for you at work . There ’s all sorts o ’ ways she can make your life hell . Smear your reputation . Turn people against you . Undermine the legitimacy of your hard work by sayin ’ the promotion is only ’cause you ’re bangin ’ the boss . Use your imagination , lass . ”

53948	53963	53970	53970	him	95	“ Not for food , lass . For a dress for the holiday party . ”
53977	54001	53974	53974	he	95	“ Unless you do n’t want a man ’s opinion on the matter . I ’m sure whatever you pick will be nice . ”
54041	54060	54061	54061	His	95	“ I mean , if you do n’t have anything better to do , that would be great . ”

54152	54171	54095	54095	he	95	“ Nothin’ . Just in my experience women usually take a lot longer than that to get ready . ”

54664	54694	54653	54653	He	95	“ God , I ’m glad I ’m not beautiful . I ’d wind up a hermit if I had to deal with this every time I went out . ”
54734	54754	54755	54755	he	95	“ The only reason you do n’t have to deal with it is because you do n’t notice it , ”
54762	54787	54755	54755	he	95	“ And the only reason you do n’t notice it is because you ’ve mind fucked yourself into thinking you ’re fat and plain . ”

55410	55429	55402	55402	Cam	95	“ You said you were glad you were n’t beautiful . How is that a compliment to me ? ”
55430	55439	55440	55440	He	95	“ Because it ’s implied that you are . ”
55450	55466	55442	55442	his	95	“ No . A negative does n’t count . You ca n’t prove a negative . ”
55539	55554	55524	55524	Cam	95	“ So what you ’re sayin ’ is that you think I ’m beautiful ? ”
55575	55587	55588	55588	He	95	“ Well . . . you ’re not entirely unfortunate looking . ”
55615	55634	55612	55612	his	95	“ It ’s a yes - or - no question , Joellen . So — yes or no ? ”

55787	55891	55783	55783	I	0	“ To me you look like a man everyone underestimates , objectifies , and misjudges because of his appearance . To me you look like a man who ’s thoughtful , insightful , and kind , but hopes no one will notice because it will be mistaken for weakness . To me you look like a man who hides his pain behind smiles and buries it in women and tries everything he can to forget whatever ’s hurting him but ca n’t because he ’s got a soft heart that scars easily , but no one has ever looked close enough to see . ”
56039	56043	56028	56028	his	95	“ Was that — ”
56044	56050	56028	56028	his	95	“ Aye . C’m on . ”

56338	56389	56327	56327	I	0	“ Stupid , stupid , stupid . One man shows you some attention , and now you think they all want you . Cam was not going to kiss you ! And he probably paid that guy in the leather jacket to stare at you , because he ’s nice ! ”
56422	56446	56447	56447	I	0	“ Be grateful the poor guy ’s helping you out , for Pete ’s sake , and stop acting like such a dimwit ! ”

61800	61814	61794	61794	Cam	95	“ Is that your mother , lass ? Tell her I said hullo ! ”
61849	61871	61839	61839	you	1080	“ Probably soon , maybe next week ? I ’ll call you as soon as I know . How ’s Dad ? ”
61872	61879	61882	61882	Mother	146	“ Who ’s that with you ? ”

62106	62129	62130	62130	Her	1087	“ I ’m talking about when you said a man like him could n’t fall in love with a girl like me . ”
62135	62197	62130	62130	Her	1087	“ Oh , honey , let ’s not go over that again . It ’s just reality . Everyone has to box in his own weight class , as your father would say . Birds of a feather and whatnot . What I ’m talking about is when I called him a sex object . That was a little . . . ”
62202	62230	62198	62198	She	1087	“ I ca n’t call myself a feminist if I ’m guilty of the same thing men are always doing to women . Namely , objectifying them . ”

62359	62435	62263	62263	she	1087	“ I ’m talking about boxing in my own weight class ! I ’m talking about how you like to make ‘ jokes ’ about me not being a size two like you guys ! Calling me ‘ plumpy ’ is n’t an affectionate nickname , it ’s a personal attack ! And just because I ’m not tall and willowy and blonde does n’t mean I ’ll never feel the touch of a man — ”
62436	62439	62318	62318	She	1087	“ Joellen ! ”
62440	62448	62263	62263	she	1087	“ — or deserve to be loved — ”
62449	62456	62263	62263	she	1087	“ Now wait just a minute ! ”
62457	62516	62318	62318	She	1087	“ — or get treated with respect by my family , the ones who I ’m supposed to be able to trust and be myself with . I ’ve had total strangers say nicer things to me than you do ! Somebody told me the other day I have beautiful skin , and I almost fainted from shock ! ”
62517	62533	62534	62534	She	1094	“ Of course you have beautiful skin , sweetie ! You get it from me ! ”

62758	62767	62747	62748	Mr. Bingley	71	“ Can I ask you a serious question ? ”
62768	62778	62714	62714	Cam	95	“ Of course , lass . Ask me anything . ”
62779	62787	62788	62788	He	71	“ Is life easier , being beautiful ? ”
62801	62815	62788	62788	He	71	“ Yes , fine , I ’m admitting I think you ’re beautiful . ”
62829	62849	62816	62816	I	0	“ You look like you were carved from a perfect piece of marble by a master sculptor . Happy ? ”
62863	62874	62859	62859	he	71	“ Who were you talkin ’ to on the phone ? ”
62875	62887	62891	62891	his	71	“ My mother . Are you going to answer my question ? ”

62942	62957	62958	62958	His	71	“ Really ? Because from where I ’m sitting , it looks pretty good . ”
62962	62968	62958	62958	His	71	“ Aye ? How so ? ”
62969	63020	63054	63054	he	71	“ C’m on , McGregor . You ’re famous . You ’re good - looking . You ’re probably super rich . You ’ve got your pick of women — and men , by the looks of it . For you the world is just one big banquet of choices . ”
63021	63025	63054	63054	he	71	“ Is it ? ”
63026	63031	63054	63054	he	71	“ Is n’t it ? ”
63057	63070	63054	63054	he	71	“ What did she say that hurt your feelin ’s this time ? ”
63077	63080	63071	63071	He	71	“ this . ”
63146	63149	63137	63137	I	0	“ Joellen . ”
63232	63293	63229	63229	he	71	“ People can be arseholes . Sometimes those arseholes are family . It sucks , but it does n’t mean you have to take on their bullshit . Your mother ’s BS is about her , not you . You ’re perfect just the way you are , lass . Anyone who tells you different is a stupid bloody arsebadger . ”
63395	63422	63379	63379	His	1102	“ Ah , lassie . If it were anyone else but family who made you cry like this , they ’d already be in an ambulance . ”

63978	63988	63989	63989	He	95	“ That ’s why it ’s called a treat . ”
64023	64053	64054	64054	He	95	“ Food is fuel , but it ’s also comfort . The trouble happens when it becomes more comfort than fuel . But that ’s what hugs are for . ”
64070	64082	64054	64054	He	95	“ You ’re a very good hugger , by the way . ”
64083	64087	64088	64088	We	1110	“ I know . ”

64125	64143	64111	64111	He	95	“ You waited until I was in a vulnerable state to ask that , did n’t you ? ”
64144	64153	64154	64154	He	95	“ I ’m not that stealthy . Here . ”
64203	64209	64199	64199	I	0	“ You seem very experienced . ”
64215	64221	64210	64210	He	95	“ That ’s awfully clinical . ”
64222	64250	64251	64251	He	95	“ Oh , I ’m sorry , is your ego throwing a tantrum because I did n’t say it was the hottest kiss I ’ve ever had ? ”
64274	64278	64271	64271	his	95	“ Was it ? ”
64300	64310	64285	64285	I	0	“ It might . . . be up there . ”
64333	64341	64342	64342	I	0	“ Oh , shut up , prancer , ”
64358	64374	64345	64345	He	95	“ For the record , it might ’ve been up there for me , too . ”
64387	64390	64345	64345	He	95	“ Really ? ”
64391	64394	64395	64395	I	0	“ Really . ”
64402	64413	64395	64395	I	0	“ You ’re just trying to make me feel better . ”
64414	64418	64419	64419	He	95	“ Am I ? ”
64456	64490	64491	64491	I	0	“ I ’m tellin ’ the truth , lass . You ’re a champion kisser . Very fine . And not fine the way you Yanks use it — fine as in excellent . ”
64504	64525	64526	64526	he	95	“ I do n’t mean to make it sound like I do n’t have anything else I could teach you , ”
64540	64547	64534	64534	He	95	“ For Michael , of course . ”
64556	64560	64534	64534	He	95	“ Like what ? ”
64561	64567	64534	64534	He	95	“ You want a list ? ”
64573	64596	64569	64569	I	0	“ A list ? There ’s that much to improve on ? I thought you said it was fine as in excellent ! ”
64656	64678	64679	64679	He	95	“ Okay . Hit me . And do n’t leave anything out . I want to hear the whole ugly truth . ”
64696	64711	64679	64679	He	95	“ It ’s not really one of those things you can talk someone through . ”
64723	64732	64733	64733	He	95	“ So how am I supposed to improve ? ”
64762	64765	64772	64772	he	95	“ Practice . ”
64813	64828	64810	64810	I	0	“ So you ’re saying . . . you want to kiss me again . ”

64894	64965	64883	64883	he	95	“ Right . Think of it as trainin ’ . Like if you were gon na run a marathon , you would n’t just run twenty - odd miles in one go . You ’d work up to it a bit at a time . Day after day , week after week , a wee bit at a time , until you ’re in prime shape for the big event . ”
64985	65049	64982	64982	his	95	“ You ’re right . It ’s a bad idea . You ’ll get all attached , and it ’ll be funny between us . You ’ll be heartsick . I ’ll be uncomfortable . You do n’t know this , but it ’s not easy for me to break a lass ’s heart . I can only stand so much beggin ’ — ”

65144	65161	65127	65127	he	95	“ Oh , aye , now I remember . You said I ’m not your type . ”
65162	65165	65166	65166	I	0	“ Exactly . ”
65187	65197	65184	65184	Cam	95	“ Exactly . So then there ’s no problem . ”
65281	65307	65266	65266	he	92	“ Fine . But this is purely . . . educational . And I do n’t want to talk about it after tonight . Deal ? ”
65318	65332	65308	65308	Cam	95	“ Whatever you say , lass . I ’m just here to help . ”
65352	65360	65308	65308	Cam	95	“ Okay . Let ’s do this . ”

65487	65504	65484	65484	He	95	“ Afraid you ’ll get too hot and bothered and rip my shirt off , lass ? ”
65505	65510	65446	65446	Cam	95	“ This is ridiculous . ”
65511	65523	65484	65484	He	95	“ Oh , so you ’re worried I ’ll get aroused . ”

65750	65798	65746	65746	Cam	95	“ Good . It ’s sorted . You ’re not jealous , I ’m not your type , and you do n’t have eyes for anyone but pretty boy Michael . Now quit yammerin ’ , woman , because I ’ve got other plans for that mouth . ”
65876	65879	65871	65871	I	0	“ Wait ! ”

73381	73415	73354	73354	Cam	95	“ Sudden from his side ! He never noticed me before a few weeks ago , and now we ’re drinking wine at his private club the second his wife files for divorce ? ”
73416	73432	73433	73433	I	0	“ How d’you know he never noticed you before ? Did he tell you that ? ”

74211	74214	74197	74197	Michael	61	“ Oh . ”

74319	74373	74315	74315	Michael	61	“ No apologies necessary . Though I have to admit when you said you already had plans for dinner , I was a little worried . You said there is n’t anything going on with you and that idiot Cameron McGregor character , but I hope I do n’t have any other competition ! ”

74707	74727	74696	74696	Michael	61	“ Really ? You ’d befriend a man who got a teenage girl pregnant and denies any responsibility whatsoever ? ”

74800	74806	74794	74794	his	95	“ Do you believe him ? ”

75325	75334	75319	75319	He	95	“ It means we ’ll never be friends . ”
75609	75614	75615	75615	He	95	“ Oh . Hey . ”

75722	75810	75811	75811	His	95	“ I mean , I ’d rather be friends than not , but if you prefer we keep it businesslike , that ’s fine with me . You ’re going to be living here for a while longer , and it would be easier if we can be civil to each other . I really do n’t want to have to deal with your rap music again . Also I ’d still like your help with the Michael thing , if you ’re still up for it . ”

75967	75981	75955	75955	he	95	“ If you talk to pretty boy today , do n’t reassure him . ”
75982	75986	76050	76050	his	95	“ About what ? ”
75987	76026	75955	75955	he	95	“ About anything . Me , the ‘ other competition ’ he mentioned , how your not - date went . Just play it off like none of it matters . It ’ll drive him crazy . Okay ? ”
76027	76033	76034	76034	He	95	“ Okay . And thanks . ”
76041	76046	76047	76047	He	95	“ You ’re welcome . ”
76288	76293	76334	76334	he	95	“ Joellen Bixby speaking . ”
76294	76300	76301	76301	Cam	95	“ This mornin ’ sucked . ”
76315	76326	76301	76301	Cam	95	“ Last night , too . I could n’t sleep . ”

76351	76361	76362	76362	he	95	“ I was never mad at you , lass , ”
76366	76372	76362	76362	he	95	“ You bloody hardheaded woman . ”
76385	76407	76408	76408	He	95	“ Good , because if I had to listen to your music again , I ’d throw myself out a window . ”
76411	76421	76408	76408	He	95	“ That ’s a little dramatic , don’tcha think ? ”
76422	76434	76447	76447	His	95	“ Plus I owe you two more home - cooked meals . ”
76435	76446	76447	76447	His	95	“ Is that right ? You ’ve been countin ’ ? ”
76467	76472	76447	76447	His	95	“ So have you , ”
76478	76501	76473	76473	I	0	“ and do n’t even try to deny it , prancer . My meat loaf is the best part of your day . ”
76502	76517	76518	76518	I	0	“ Aye , lass . Your loaf is almost as good as your pie . ”
76529	76543	76518	76518	I	0	“ Speaking of my pie , any requests for your last two meals ? ”
76554	76580	76544	76544	Cam	95	“ Well of course I want that pie , lassie . I love that pie . Sweetest thing I ’ve ever had in my mouth . ”
76628	76644	76645	76645	He	95	“ There ’s a picture of us on the internet . A celebrity gossip site . ”
76651	76660	76648	76648	his	95	“ I ’m sorry . Are you okay ? ”
76661	76733	76734	76734	Cam	95	“ Yes , I ’m fine , and you do n’t have to be sorry . I think it ’s raised my cred around the office . The girl who sits next to me is treating me like I ’m Beyoncé . And a couple of the guys in accounting said hi to me on the elevator . I think next they ’re going to ask me to get your autograph . ”
76737	76755	76734	76734	Cam	95	“ It ’s not me the guys from accounting are interested in , you wee daft bugger . ”
76788	76801	76802	76802	He	95	“ You ’re very good for my ego , you know that ? ”
76805	76823	76802	76802	He	95	“ Well , you ’re shit for mine , so at least one of us is happy . ”
76843	76854	76828	76828	I	0	“ Do n’t forget I called you beautiful , prancer . ”
76873	76913	76866	76866	he	95	“ I meant it , too . You ’re like this big , gorgeous , mountain of a man , who also happens to have a great sense of humor and an excellent vocabulary . You ’re a catch . ”
76937	76960	76934	76934	he	95	“ Sounds like I deserve a sonnet . We ’ll call it ‘ Mountain Man . ’ What rhymes with enormous muscles ? ”
76976	76997	76970	76970	my	0	“ I already wrote you one . But it was n’t about your muscles , it was about your eyes . ”
77048	77053	77037	77037	Cam	95	“ Sure , lass . ”
77110	77118	77120	77120	Cam	95	“ Why ’re you breathin ’ funny ? ”
77128	77158	77120	77120	Cam	95	“ That pesky intestinal gas botherin ’ you again ? You want me to stop by the store and pick you up a few pairs of your charcoal panties ? ”
77159	77162	77163	77163	I	0	“ Ha . ”
77173	77176	77163	77163	I	0	“ Wait . ”
77184	77197	77177	77177	He	95	“ Do n’t tell me you really did write me a sonnet . ”
77214	77227	77234	77234	his	95	“ Lassie . You know what happens if you lie to me . ”
77247	77265	77241	77241	I	0	“ Yes , I know what happens , prancer . You ’ll take me over your knee . ”
77266	77271	77350	77350	his	95	“ That ’s right . ”
77272	77290	77350	77350	his	95	“ But . . . if I just do n’t admit something , that ’s not lying . ”
77291	77304	77350	77350	his	95	“ It ’s a lie of omission . It is lyin ’ . ”
77305	77321	77350	77350	his	95	“ God , it ’s like you ’re looking for an excuse to spank me ! ”
77322	77346	77350	77350	his	95	“ I ’d like an excuse to do a lot of bad things to you , darlin ’ . You have no idea . ”
77400	77404	77396	77396	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
77435	77457	77416	77416	his	95	“ Ach , would n’t you like to know ! Do n’t you have work to be doin’ , you slacker ? ”
77458	77469	77510	77510	he	95	“ Hey , you ’re the one who called me . ”
77470	77495	77496	77496	His	95	“ Aye , I did . And now I ’m gon na hang up . Do n’t forget — pie tonight , darlin ’ . ”
77500	77508	77496	77496	His	95	“ And I want it extra hot . ”
77563	77580	77581	77581	he	95	“ Fair warnin ’ to all the occupants of this house , Cameron McGregor is here ! ”
77632	77642	77626	77626	his	71	“ Hullo , you wee ball - less bastard , ”
77653	77659	77645	77645	Cam	95	“ Where ’s your mum ? ”
77660	77664	77670	77670	Cam	95	“ In here ! ”
77692	77695	77696	77696	he	71	“ Lassie , ”
77704	77714	77696	77696	he	71	“ what d’you think of my new fur coat ? ”
77727	77743	77715	77715	I	0	“ I think that animal is almost as in love with you as you are . ”
77744	77757	77758	77758	He	71	“ Aye . He ’s a sensible lad . How was work ? ”
77790	77859	77779	77779	I	0	“ Good . And weird . Michael left me an apology note on my desk with his cell phone number . Portia keeps glaring at me like she ’s plotting my kidnapping and murder . And the girl who sits next to me wo n’t stop pestering me about the size of your junk . She ’s convinced that picture on TMZ is proof that we ’re boning . ”
77860	77884	77885	77885	He	71	“ We already had the talk about you disrespectin ’ the family jewels by callin ’ ’em ‘ junk , ’ darlin ’ . ”
77910	77913	77885	77885	He	71	“ Hey ! ”
77919	77932	77885	77885	He	71	“ You know I do n’t like it when you do that ! ”
77933	77949	77950	77950	He	71	“ It ’s my dinner , lass . I ’ll eat it how I want . ”
77994	78009	77984	77984	I	0	“ You should n’t eat undercooked meat , prancer . You ’ll get salmonella . ”
78010	78033	78068	78068	him	71	“ Pfft . As if bacteria would dare to mess with me . I ’ll have you know I never get sick . ”
78034	78055	77984	77984	I	0	“ Make yourself useful and set the table before I dump this pan over the top of your thick skull . ”
78056	78064	78068	78068	him	71	“ So you told her , right ? ”
78106	78111	78100	78100	he	71	“ Told who what ? ”
78112	78133	78134	78134	My	0	“ Told the girl who sits next to you at work about the majesty and opulence of my family jewels . ”
78149	78152	78140	78140	I	0	“ No . ”
78153	78167	78205	78205	he	95	“ Why not ? It ’s not as if you do n’t know . ”
78175	78186	78187	78187	Cam	95	“ Are you going to set the table or not ? ”
78197	78203	78187	78187	Cam	95	“ Tell her eleven inches . ”
78217	78231	78211	78211	he	95	“ Or you could tell her the truth and see if she faints . ”
78253	78257	78258	78258	I	0	“ Moving on , ”
78275	78285	78286	78286	I	0	“ What do you think about Michael ’s note ? ”
78303	78309	78298	78298	he	95	“ Did you call him ? ”
78310	78313	78298	78298	he	95	“ No . ”
78314	78320	78298	78298	he	95	“ Did you email him ? ”
78321	78324	78298	78298	he	95	“ No . ”
78325	78334	78298	78298	he	95	“ Did you see him around the office ? ”
78335	78338	78298	78298	he	95	“ No . ”
78339	78353	78354	78354	My	0	“ Then I think you ’re gon na get a phone call tonight . ”
78360	78363	78354	78354	My	0	“ Really ? ”
78364	78372	78298	78298	he	95	“ Yep . We should talk strategy . ”
78373	78383	78384	78384	Cam	95	“ Strategy ? You make it sound like war . ”
78399	78417	78418	78418	He	95	“ Love is war , darlin ’ . Only thing in life worth sheddin ’ blood over . ”
78520	78526	78517	78517	he	95	“ That ’s dark beer . ”
78527	78541	78543	78543	he	95	“ I know . I remembered that ’s what you said you liked . ”
78556	78561	78562	78562	Cam	95	“ It ’s imported . ”
78566	78585	78562	78562	Cam	95	“ The guy at the store told me it was good . It cost more than the meat ! ”
78586	78594	78595	78595	he	95	“ No need to shout , lassie , ”
78606	78614	78595	78595	he	95	“ I hear you loud and clear . ”
78652	78657	78658	78658	I	0	“ You ’re impossible , ”
78661	78672	78658	78658	I	0	“ Impossibly wonderful , I know . Back to strategy . ”
78726	78741	78718	78718	God	74	“ Fine . Strategy . Tell me how I should act when he calls . ”
78742	78751	78752	78752	I	0	“ The same way you act with me . ”
78757	78770	78752	78752	I	0	“ I ca n’t act with him like I act with you ! ”
78771	78778	78718	78718	God	74	“ Like yourself , you mean ? ”
78779	78798	78799	78799	Cam	95	“ Exactly ! He ’ll never like me if I act like myself ! I ’m a disaster ! ”
78826	78890	78891	78891	I	0	“ Bypassin ’ how barmy it is that you ’d wanna be with a man who wo n’t like you if you act like yourself , what I meant was do n’t cater to his ego . Do n’t fall all over yourself to pay him compliments . Treat him like he ’s your little brother : sometimes cute but mostly annoyin ’ . ”
78901	78919	78891	78891	I	0	“ How is treating a man like he ’s annoying in any way attractive to said man ? ”
78920	79032	79033	79033	I	0	“ It does n’t work with all men . But on lads like him — rich and pretty , used to havin’ women fall at his feet — it works like a charm . Because you ’re a challenge , you see ? You ’re different . He has to chase you , which is fun but also establishes that you have value . You wo n’t just hand yourself over . When a man has to work hard for somethin’ he wants , he values it twice as much when he finally gets it . Then you ’re a prize that he earned , not a gift he was given . ”
79060	79067	79068	79068	Cam	95	“ Okay , that makes sense . ”
79083	79102	79068	79068	Cam	95	“ I ’m sorry , could you repeat that ? Did you just admit I might be right ? ”
79103	79110	79111	79111	Cam	95	“ Shut up . What else ? ”
79228	79231	79222	79222	he	95	“ What ? ”
79242	79280	79237	79237	his	95	“ Nothin’ . Only you might want to work on developin ’ a bit more of a poker face , lassie . If you leer at Michael like that , he ’ll know the jig is up . ”
79281	79289	79237	79237	his	95	“ I was n’t leering at you ! ”
79290	79347	79348	79348	I	0	“ I can take my shirt off if you like . I ’ll even let you pet my biceps , but that ’s as far as it ’s goin’ because I ’m not just a beautiful , sonnet - worthy Mountain Man , you know . I ’m a human being . I ’ve got feelings . ”
79382	79387	79388	79388	I	0	“ You ’re funny , ”
79398	79408	79388	79388	I	0	“ Can we get back to strategy , please ? ”
79421	79434	79435	79435	I	0	“ You ’re adorable when you ’re embarrassed . Those pink cheeks . ”
79485	79537	79473	79473	Cam	95	“ All right , movin ’ on . Rule number one — we’ll call it the golden rule — is make him chase you . The longer , the better . But there are lots of subrules to this one . They all involve the art of parsin ’ yourself out . ”
79538	79544	79643	79643	he	95	“ That sounds disturbingly prostitutional . ”
79545	79588	79589	79589	I	0	“ Think of it like you ’re leavin ’ a trail of crumbs . Small , delicious Joellen crumbs . A little bit here , a little bit there , just enough to heighten his hunger but never enough to satisfy it . ”
79603	79610	79589	79589	I	0	“ This is all very complicated . ”
79611	79638	79643	79643	he	95	“ It ’s the easiest thing in the world , darlin ’ . It ’s called seduction , and it ’s a game where everyone wins . ”
79646	79654	79643	79643	he	95	“ What was that wistful sigh for ? ”
79655	79673	79674	79674	Cam	95	“ Everything would be so much easier if it could just be like it is with us . ”
79690	79700	79681	79681	He	95	“ You mean if you could just be friends . ”
79757	79760	79749	79749	I	0	“ Oh ! ”
79773	79776	79768	79768	I	0	“ What ? ”
79788	79796	79777	79777	I	0	“ I ’ll pretend he ’s you ! ”
79824	79828	79806	79806	He	95	“ Come again ? ”
79829	79845	79856	79856	his	95	“ Like you told me to do when we kissed — pretend you were him ! ”
79846	79851	79852	79852	he	95	“ And did you ? ”
79925	79930	79910	79910	I	0	“ Um . . . ”
79931	79935	79937	79937	Cam	95	“ Go ahead , ”
79940	79945	79937	79937	Cam	95	“ Lie to me . ”
80068	80071	80047	80047	he	95	“ Hello ? ”
80072	80079	80047	80047	he	95	“ Joellen . It ’s Michael . ”
80097	80104	80105	80105	Cam	95	“ Oh . Hello , Michael . ”
80123	80134	80117	80117	My	0	“ Is now a good time for us to talk ? ”
80135	80138	80144	80144	Cam	95	“ Actually , Michael”—I

80267	80273	80211	80211	I	0	“ Will do . Thanks . ”
80274	80279	80231	80231	Michael	61	“ Good - bye . ”

80338	80343	80344	80344	he	95	“ That was good , ”
80350	80379	80344	80344	he	95	“ Sounded very natural . When you call him back , do n’t talk for more than ten minutes , and make sure you end the call first . ”
80380	80390	80391	80391	Cam	95	“ I ’m not going to call him back . ”
80403	80406	80391	80391	Cam	95	“ No ? ”
80407	80421	80344	80344	he	95	“ I have a dinner guest . I ’ll talk to him tomorrow . ”
80437	80451	80344	80344	he	95	“ You ’ve been waitin ’ on him for ten years , lassie . ”
80452	80478	80493	80493	His	95	“ So one more day wo n’t hurt . Besides , I need practice with the golden rule . I ’m dropping crumbs , right ? ”
80479	80492	80493	80493	His	95	“ I dunno , Joellen . Is that what you ’re doin’ ? ”
80605	80636	80601	80601	he	95	“ Whatever it is you ’re doin’ , you better be sure . Take your time . Figure it out . But be sure . You owe it to yourself . ”

82628	82648	82624	82624	Michael	61	“ It ’s a bit early for lunch , is n’t it ? It ’s barely past eleven o’clock . ”
82656	82670	82649	82649	Cam	95	“ Joellen could n’t wait . Called and asked me to come sooner . ”
82727	82773	82720	82720	she	63	“ How nice ! You work so hard , Joellen . You deserve to take a long lunch . I ’ll speak to you later this afternoon . I just wanted to go over your current workload with you . It can wait . Gentlemen . ”
82817	82833	82834	82834	Cam	95	“ C’m on , lass . I know how you get when you ’re hungry . ”
82919	82930	82933	82933	Cam	95	“ Have a great lunch . See you later . Mr. McGregor”—he
82938	82947	82933	82933	Cam	95	smile—“it was a real treat to meet you . ”
82973	82980	82966	82966	His	95	“ I get that a lot . ”
83027	83033	83034	83034	I	0	“ Holy hell , McGregor , ”
83042	83052	83034	83034	I	0	“ I hope you know what you ’re doing . ”
83060	83071	83055	83055	Michael	61	“ Sure I do . I ’m wagin ’ war . ”
83081	83122	83078	83078	he	95	“ If that prissy little peacock was n’t in love with you before , he definitely is now . There ’s nothin’ his kind hates more than a lower - class grunt gettin ’ uppity and poachin ’ his property . ”
83123	83140	83190	83190	his	95	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , McGregor . Michael does n’t think I ’m his property . ”
83141	83178	83179	83179	He	95	“ Aye , lass , he does . The question is whether or not you ’re gon na enjoy it when you find out what bein ’ the property of a man like him is like . ”
83216	83223	83225	83225	I	0	“ Bitch , what the hell ? ”
83313	83319	83320	83320	I	0	“ I love Italian food , ”
83335	83339	83340	83340	He	95	“ I know . ”
83361	83371	83358	83358	he	95	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle told me it ’s your favorite . ”
83375	83408	83372	83372	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m always trying to get her to try my lasagna , but whenever I suggest it , she looks at me as if I ’ve farted in church . ”
83409	83421	83358	83358	he	95	“ The British are n’t exactly known for being adventurous eaters . ”
83422	83433	83434	83434	Cam	95	“ I ’d hardly call noodles and tomato sauce adventurous . ”
83437	83443	83434	83434	Cam	95	“ You ’re not British . ”
83444	83451	83358	83358	he	95	“ You ’ve got me there . ”
83452	83484	83485	83485	I	0	“ But pretty boy certainly is . He ’d give the Prince of Wales a run for his money in the silk - pocket - square - and - stuffiness department . ”
83493	83499	83488	83488	Cam	95	“ He ’s just reserved . ”
83500	83506	83507	83507	I	0	“ Repressed , you mean . ”
83553	83567	83544	83544	I	0	“ Carbs are proof that God loves us , do n’t you think ? ”
83568	83578	83579	83579	He	95	“ I think Benjamin Franklin said that about wine . ”
83592	83597	83579	83579	He	95	“ You ’re staring . ”
83598	83626	83627	83627	My	0	“ I like watchin ’ you eat . Your enjoyment of food is obvious . It ’s not often a woman allows herself that pleasure in public . ”
83663	83673	83654	83654	Cam	95	“ Do n’t be embarrassed . It ’s sexy . ”
83737	83740	83734	83734	Cam	95	“ So . ”
83741	83744	83745	83745	His	95	“ So . ”
83753	83769	83745	83745	His	95	“ D’you wanna talk about your little internet research project first , or pretty boy ? ”
83780	83805	83770	83770	I	0	“ Okay . Pretty boy it is . No , wait , first tell me who the woman was who stopped by your desk ? ”
83806	83811	83812	83812	He	95	“ That was Portia . ”
83817	83834	83814	83814	his	95	“ She did n’t seem nearly as bad as you ’ve made her out to be . ”
83835	83852	83853	83853	I	0	“ I know . It ’s weird . She almost seemed human for a minute there . ”
83865	83900	83853	83853	I	0	“ She was probably just dazed into acting like a person and not a witch because her brain was taking a nice warm dopamine bath brought on by standing three feet away from you . ”
83908	83924	83901	83901	Cam	95	“ Oh ? Is that what happens to females when I walk into a room ? ”
83932	83972	83925	83925	I	0	“ Oh , please , McGregor . You know the effect you have on women . It ’s like you ’re one of those magicians who does mass hypnosis tricks , making everyone in the audience crow like roosters . ”
83981	83985	83973	83973	He	95	“ Not everyone . ”
84018	84038	84012	84012	Cam	95	“ Pretty boy ’s gon na ask you what the deal is with us , first thing he can . ”
84039	84050	84103	84103	His	95	“ I ’ve already told him we ’re just friends . ”
84051	84102	84103	84103	His	95	“ You ’re gon na have to tell him again . But do n’t get drawn into a long discussion about it . Wave your hand like you just did at me , and change the subject . If he insists , tell him that I ’m not your type . ”
84107	84121	84103	84103	His	95	“ It wo n’t take much convincin ’ for him to believe it . ”
84122	84129	84130	84130	Cam	95	“ Why do you say that ? ”
84145	84164	84130	84130	Cam	95	“ Because no matter how much money I have , I ’m still just a jobby to him . ”
84165	84168	84103	84103	His	95	“ Jobby ? ”
84169	84191	84130	84130	Cam	95	“ Trash . Unworthy to even be in his presence , much less earn the attention of a woman he fancies . ”
84291	84298	84299	84299	I	0	“ Spit it out , lass . ”
84323	84335	84319	84319	he	95	“ I already told you , you can ask me anything . ”
84391	84428	84429	84429	Cam	95	“ I owe you an apology for assuming your life was all butterflies and rainbows . It makes me feel crappy that you probably get that a lot . Assumptions about who you are . Judgments . ”
84436	84447	84429	84429	Cam	95	“ Thank you . But that was n’t a question . ”
84572	84578	84565	84567	A true friend	1379	“ I ’m here for you ”
84603	84606	84599	84599	Cam	95	“ Lass . ”
84628	84634	84635	84635	I	0	“ Give me a minute , ”
84681	84759	84672	84672	my	0	“ I think you ’re an amazing person . I appreciate everything you ’ve done for me . This whole Michael project . . . it means a lot . I do n’t take your help for granted . And I ’m sorry for all the stupid things I ’ve said to you , all the times I ’ve been sarcastic or flippant . I was n’t trying to be mean . I was just . . . ”
84760	84768	84769	84769	Cam	95	“ You were just bein ’ yourself , ”
84795	84860	84790	84790	he	95	“ You can quit beatin ’ yourself up now , lass . I know you appreciate me . And I love that sharp tongue of yours . I love that you feel comfortable enough with me to give me a good dressin ’ down . I need that , y’know . Someone to stick a pin in my balloon when it gets too inflated . ”
84867	84881	84861	84861	I	0	“ Your balloon must have a lot more pinpricks since you met me . ”
84893	84909	84882	84882	He	95	“ Aye . But a real friend is someone who stabs you in the front . ”
84910	84916	84966	84966	his	95	“ That ’s Oscar Wilde . ”
84917	84946	84947	84947	We	1381	“ Do n’t look so surprised , lass . I ’ve read Oscar Wilde . You did n’t think I was just another pretty face , did you ? ”
84956	84963	84964	84964	He	95	“ So , we are friends . ”
84971	84985	84966	84966	his	95	“ Why is it so important to you this relationship has a title ? ”
85178	85196	85164	85164	he	95	“ Yes . I ’ll call it Mountain Man Unmasked . It ’ll be an instant bestseller . ”
85197	85216	85217	85217	Our	1391	“ Okay . I ’ll approve it . But only if you include the sonnet about my eyes . ”
85386	85416	85417	85417	She	1340	“ Oh my gosh , Joellen , I did n’t know who that was when he came in . I only knew he was big and handsome and oh ! ”
85422	85460	85417	85417	She	1340	“ So hot ! But then Shasta told me who he was and showed me the picture of you guys on TMZ and geez , are you dating him ? How long has this been going on ? ”
85461	85467	85468	85468	I	0	“ He ’s my neighbor , ”
85490	85509	85478	85478	Kim	210	“ So you ’re not dating him ? Oh gosh , that ’s a shame , that man is just”—she
85511	85542	85543	85543	Shasta	121	herself—“scorching ! But he ’s your neighbor , you say ? Maybe I could come over and hang out sometime , you know , like tonight ? Are you free ? ”
85575	85578	85579	85579	she	121	“ Joellen ! ”
85586	85608	85579	85579	she	121	“ Holy fucksicles that man is ten times hotter in person than he is in pictures ! And he ’s huge ! ”
85609	85618	85561	85561	She	121	“ Do n’t ask me about his ju — ”
85619	85649	85650	85650	She	121	“ You have to tell me what he looks like naked ! Please ? Pretty please ? Just give me a hint how big it is ! Like this ? ”
85666	85669	85652	85652	her	121	“ This ? ”
85681	85700	85676	85676	I	0	“ You ’re deranged , Shasta . He ’s not a piece of meat . Let it go . ”
85843	85847	85848	85848	I	0	“ You guys ! ”
85854	85864	85848	85848	I	0	“ Chill out ! He ’s just my neighbor ! ”

85941	85963	85933	85933	she	63	“ Sorry about that . I , uh , think everyone was a little . . . overexcited by my visitor . ”
85975	86008	85933	85933	she	63	“ One can hardly blame them . The last time we had a male visitor on the thirty - third floor was when Theodore Scanlon came in to negotiate his new contract . ”
86073	86078	86099	86099	Portia	63	“ Write what you know ”

86204	86226	86200	86200	She	63	“ Oh , never mind . I found what I was looking for . Just . . . moving things around . ”

86681	86712	86747	86747	he	61	“ I ’m sorry I did n’t call you back last night . Dinner went a little late , and I was n’t sure how long you usually stay up . ”
86713	86734	86747	86747	he	61	“ You can call me anytime . I mean it . Day or night , do n’t hesitate to call . ”
86735	86738	86747	86747	he	61	“ Okay . ”
86759	86772	86747	86747	he	61	“ Thanks . Um , are you in your own place now ? ”
86773	86817	86824	86824	he	61	“ Yes . We agreed she ’d stay in the house while the lawyers fight over the details of who gets to keep what . I ’ve rented a place overlooking Central Park . The view is spectacular . You ’d love it . ”
86837	86840	86824	86824	he	61	“ she , ”
86863	86874	86875	86875	We	1421	“ I ’m sure I would . It sounds beautiful . ”
86892	86904	86889	86889	Michael	61	“ Okay , I have to get this off my chest . ”
86912	86917	86889	86889	Michael	61	“ What is it ? ”
86928	86937	86918	86918	He	61	“ I ’m jealous of your rugby player . ”
87038	87071	87072	87072	Michael	61	“ You do n’t need to be jealous of him . I was telling you the truth when I said we were friends . There ’s really nothing going on between us . ”
87079	87125	87126	87126	He	61	“ That ’s good to hear . I know I do n’t have any right to be jealous , but honestly I ’ve thought about you for so long it would probably break my heart if you were taken the moment I was set free . ”
87150	87157	87158	87158	I	0	“ You ’ve thought about me ? ”
87177	87203	87171	87171	His	61	“ You must ’ve known . My God , the amount of time I ’ve spent staring at you , I was afraid everyone knew . ”

87462	87470	87471	87471	Michael	61	“ I was just thinking about Portia . ”
87479	87486	87471	87471	Michael	61	“ Portia ? What about her ? ”
87487	87497	87498	87498	Michael	61	“ I think she has a crush on you . ”
87505	87530	87498	87498	Michael	61	“ You ’re giving her too much credit . If she had a crush on me , it would mean she had a heart ! ”
87546	87557	87543	87543	Michael	61	“ Besides , I do n’t have the right equipment . ”
87563	87567	87558	87558	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”

87612	87627	87558	87558	I	0	“ A lesbian , yes . Do n’t tell me you did n’t know . ”
87642	87653	87586	87586	he	1437	“ I had no idea ! How do you know ? ”
87654	87691	87692	87692	I	0	“ I ’ve met her girlfriend . They ’ve been together for years . Portia and my wife serve together on the board of a national literacy organization . We ’ve seen them socially many times . ”
87763	87790	87918	87918	his	1439	“ Wow . I honestly had no clue . I wonder why she never brought her girlfriend to any of the holiday parties or summer picnics ? ”
87797	87812	87918	87918	his	1439	“ I think she was concerned how it would be viewed by the staff . ”
87813	87834	87918	87918	his	1439	“ What do you mean , ‘ viewed ’ ? You think she ’s worried she ’ll be discriminated against ? ”
87835	87840	87918	87918	his	1439	“ Well , naturally . ”
87841	87898	87918	87918	his	1439	“ I do n’t understand . Why ‘ naturally ’ ? I know a dozen gay people at Maddox who are out , and no one gives them grief . The company culture is very inclusive , but even if it were n’t , we have written policies against discrimination . And there ’s federal law — ”
87899	87914	87918	87918	his	1439	“ No one in a position of authority is openly gay in the company . ”
87924	87929	87930	87930	I	0	“ That ’s true , ”
87963	88007	87956	87956	his	61	“ I ’ve encouraged her to take a leadership role in that regard , of course , but she does n’t feel comfortable . And it is n’t my place to insist . I respect her wishes to keep her private life private . ”
88008	88020	87947	87947	he	1439	“ Yes , of course , if she ’s not comfortable — ”
88021	88027	88028	88028	Michael	61	“ But enough about Portia , ”
88031	88058	88028	88028	Michael	61	“ Let ’s talk about you . Have you been working out ? Because I noticed you seem to be looking a bit tighter of late . ”
88099	88108	88109	88109	I	0	“ Yes , I have been working out , ”
88113	88148	88109	88109	I	0	“ That ’s the project I told you Cam was helping me with . I decided to start exercising and eating better , and you know , he ’s a professional athlete , so . ”

88219	88230	88234	88234	he	1441	“ Oh , sure . . . I love squash . ”
88241	88259	88234	88234	he	1441	“ Great ! When I get back from London , I ’ll take you to my club . ”

88268	88314	88316	88316	I	0	“ Yes . I leave tomorrow . I ’ve been meaning to tell you , but I have n’t had the chance . I ’ve got meetings with some of our European distributors , but I ’ll be back on Saturday the twenty - third . ”
88323	88342	88316	88316	I	0	“ That ’s the day of the office holiday party . Are you still going to make it ? ”
88347	88357	88343	88343	His	1441	“ I would n’t miss it for the world . ”
88367	88392	88343	88343	His	1441	“ Okay . Um . . . maybe we can email while you ’re gone ? You know , just to keep in touch ? ”
88393	88399	88400	88400	he	1441	“ I ’d like that , ”
88403	88414	88400	88400	he	1441	“ I ’d like that very much . And Joellen ? ”
88415	88418	88343	88343	His	1441	“ Yes ? ”

88434	88438	88431	88431	I	0	“ Me too . ”
88610	88634	88597	88597	He	95	“ You ’re lookin ’ me up again , are n’t you , lass ? Tch . It ’s becomin ’ an obsession ! ”
88635	88673	88674	88674	He	95	“ Get over yourself , prancer . There ’s a whole big world out there that does n’t involve you . I ’m trying to find out how to play squash . Who ’re the flowers for ? ”
88684	88695	88674	88674	He	95	“ Is there someone else who lives in this apartment ? ”
88703	88711	88712	88712	He	95	“ They ’re for me ? Really ? ”
88720	88747	88712	88712	He	95	“ Christ on a crutch , Miss Snufflebottom , you ’re hopeless . Take the bloody things before I smack you upside the head with ’em . ”
88761	88767	88748	88748	I	0	“ These are my favorite . ”
88778	88803	88770	88770	I	0	“ They always remind me of home . My mom got them fresh from the farmers market every Friday when I was growing up . ”
88804	88808	88809	88809	I	0	“ I know . ”
88818	88829	88830	88830	He	95	“ Have you been going through my trash or something ? ”
88833	88841	88830	88830	He	95	“ Mrs. Dinwiddle enjoys a good gossip . ”
88845	88852	88853	88853	He	95	“ True . But . . . ”
88863	88880	88853	88853	He	95	“ It ’s our last supper , lass . The occasion seemed to call for flowers . ”
88881	88890	88891	88891	I	0	“ That sounds uncomfortably biblical , but thanks . ”
88901	88911	88891	88891	I	0	“ I see you discovered you own a razor . ”
88920	88933	88912	88912	He	95	“ Aye . I was startin ’ to appear a bit cavemannish . ”
88940	88967	88934	88934	His	95	“ You fancy the proper pretty boy look , so I thought it bein ’ a special night and all , I ’d make an effort . ”
88968	88974	88975	88975	I	0	“ Scruff suits you better , ”
88980	89000	88975	88975	I	0	“ You ’re way too manly to be overgroomed . All your rough edges are much more . . . ”
89025	89033	89034	89034	I	0	“ Oh , shut up , prancer , ”
89047	89059	89060	89060	Cam	95	“ No , I do n’t think I will , lassie , ”
89066	89079	89060	89060	Cam	95	“ At least not until you tell me how that sentence ends . ”
89099	89112	89080	89080	He	95	“ It ends with me jabbing a sharp object into your eye . ”
89161	89168	89169	89169	he	95	“ Hot ? Sexy ? Devastating ? ”
89178	89194	89169	89169	he	95	“ Hmm . She ’s mute on the subject . I must be g’tting close . ”
89195	89208	89209	89209	His	95	“ You ’re getting close to serious bodily injury . Be quiet . ”
89274	89283	89284	89284	His	95	“ How come you never smile in photographs ? ”
89323	89356	89372	89372	he	95	“ I mean , I see you smiling and laughing all the time , like you are right now , but in pictures you always look kind of . . . miserable . ”
89375	89384	89372	89372	he	95	“ You ca n’t really be that naïve . ”
89396	89402	89372	89372	he	95	“ What do you mean ? ”
89403	89429	89430	89430	I	0	“ I mean spend a little time thinkin ’ about what you just asked me , woman , and you ’ll find your goddamn answer . ”
89453	89469	89444	89444	he	95	“ Why are you mad at me ? You said I could ask you anything ! ”
89518	89523	89524	89524	He	95	“ Ah , lassie . ”
89539	89548	89532	89532	His	95	“ You ’ll be the death of me . ”
89549	89578	89579	89579	He	95	“ Yeah , maybe , if you keep acting like a dick . In case you have n’t noticed , I ’ve got pruning shears in my hand . ”
89615	89623	89624	89624	I	0	“ You ’re so friggin ’ weird , ”
89633	89652	89624	89624	I	0	“ And you ca n’t see past the end of your nose , but here we are anyway . ”
89653	89680	89687	89687	him	95	“ You and your ambiguous statements are gon na be the death of me , prancer . Speaking of bad vision , I have a question . ”
89690	89696	89687	89687	him	95	“ Of course you do . ”
89697	89707	89624	89624	I	0	“ Do you think I should ditch the glasses ? ”
89708	89715	89624	89624	I	0	“ For what , a monocle ? ”
89716	89722	89723	89723	I	0	“ Yes , a monocle , ”
89727	89746	89723	89723	I	0	“ They ’re so in style . Can you be serious for a second ? This is important . ”
89757	89775	89747	89747	He	95	“ Aye . This is me bein ’ serious . You can tell by my forbidding brow . ”
89798	89823	89787	89787	his	95	“ Okay , okay . Do n’t put a hex on me . The question is if I think you should ditch your glasses ? ”
89824	89830	89831	89831	He	95	“ That is the question . ”
89852	89864	89865	89865	I	0	“ Take a picture , prancer , it ’ll last longer , ”
89870	89890	89865	89865	I	0	“ I ’m tryin ’ to decide how to phrase somethin’ so it wo n’t offend your missish nerves . ”
89891	89900	89901	89901	Cam	95	“ Missish ? Is that even a word ? ”
89905	89918	89901	89901	Cam	95	“ Oh , the fancy editor lady has n’t heard of it ? ”
89930	89939	89927	89927	he	95	“ It means demure . Squeamish . Prudish . ”
89940	89948	89952	89952	his	95	“ You ’re calling me a prude ? ”
89955	90012	89952	89952	his	95	“ No man who ’s ever kissed you would call you a prude , darlin ’ . What I ’m sayin ’ is that you ’re highly sensitive about your looks . One misplaced word and you ’ll be locked in your room makin ’ a list of all the ways you think you ’re ugly . ”
90135	90137	90149	90150	Cameron McGregor	92	“ cankles ”

90169	90181	90183	90183	Cam	95	“ Do n’t break your brain overanalyzin ’ that , Joellen , ”
90186	90203	90204	90204	He	95	“ I ca n’t help it . My brain is set to think things to death . ”
90209	90215	90206	90206	his	95	“ You do n’t say ? ”
90228	90244	90225	90225	him	95	“ All right . Here ’s what I think about you ditchin ’ your glasses . ”
90262	90272	90252	90252	him	95	“ I do n’t think you should do it . ”
90293	90311	90284	90285	the man	323	“ I have contact lenses , but I never wear them because they make my eyes red . ”
90312	90319	90320	90320	he	95	“ Thank you for sharin ’ , ”
90323	90339	90320	90320	he	95	“ Ask me why I do n’t think you should get rid of your glasses . ”
90340	90354	90284	90285	the man	323	“ Why do n’t you think I should get rid of my glasses ? ”
90355	90380	90284	90285	the man	323	“ Because they make you look smart , and sexy , and like you do n’t give a fuck , which is also sexy . ”
90381	90384	90320	90320	he	95	“ Oh . ”
90407	90413	90395	90395	He	95	“ I was n’t finished . ”
90430	90479	90420	90420	I	0	“ The main reason I do n’t think you should get rid of them is because you prefer them . If you did n’t , you ’d wear your contacts or get laser surgery . But you like your glasses , so that ’s what you should wear . ”
90480	90494	90395	90395	He	95	“ But . . . do n’t most guys think they ’re dorky ? ”
90495	90557	90558	90558	He	1454	“ The number of fucks you should give about what men think of how you look is zero , lass . Every choice you make about your appearance should be about what makes you feel good , not what makes some random lad — or your mother — think you ’re cute . Do n’t set aside your preferences for anyone . ”
90590	90741	90584	90584	he	1454	“ And another thing . Learn to stop saying ‘ Sorry , ’ and say ‘ Do n’t interrupt me . ’ Learn to say ‘ No ’ and ‘ None of your business . ’ Learn to be unapologetic for who you are and what you like and the opinions you hold . I know you think that if other people considered you beautiful , all your problems would be solved , but you ’d just have different problems . And they ’d all still revolve around the fact that deep down , you do n’t think you ’re good enough . That ’s a lie you learned , and you can unlearn it , but it has to start with you . You have to decide to accept yourself . It ’s cliché , but you really do have to love yourself before you can love anyone else . ”
90764	90825	90759	90759	his	1455	“ My mother was one of the most beautiful women I ’ve ever seen , but she killed herself over a man who was n’t even worthy to breathe the same air she did . Total fucking waste . All because she did n’t think she was good enough . A lie life pounded into her that she never unlearned . ”
90826	90834	90755	90755	he	1455	“ You ’re talking about Sir Gladstone ? ”
90842	90935	90936	90936	He	1456	“ Aye . That worthless piece of shit . Thought he could run roughshod over anyone because he was rich . He treated his house staff like slaves , allowing them no voices or power , giving them no appreciation . Unless you were pretty , and then you got the kind of attention a broken soul can confuse with love . He used her for years , until a younger housemaid came along . Then he acted like he never knew my mother . She was replaced , just like that . ”
90941	91025	90936	90936	He	1456	“ I saw the whole thing comin ’ , but she ’d never hear a word spoken against him . She thought because he came into her room a few nights a week and let me play rugby with his spoiled fucking children , that meant he loved her . But he did n’t . And when she found out , it killed her . She went up to the roof and threw herself off without even tellin ’ me good - bye . ”
91047	91057	91058	91058	He	1457	“ Oh , Cam . I ’m so sorry . ”
91074	91080	91058	91058	He	1457	“ Aye . Me too . ”
91101	91105	91106	91106	I	0	“ Stand up , ”
91114	91122	91106	91106	I	0	“ I ’m giving you a hug . ”
91211	91216	91217	91217	he	1457	“ Promise me something , ”
91223	91226	91217	91217	he	1457	“ What ? ”
91227	91241	91217	91217	he	1457	“ No matter what happens with Michael , we ’ll still be friends . ”
91242	91253	91254	91254	His	1457	“ I thought you did n’t want to be friends . ”
91263	91271	91254	91254	His	1457	“ God , you ’re an idiot . ”
91272	91289	91290	91290	I	0	“ That ’s probably not something you should say to someone with low self - esteem , ”
91311	91329	91295	91295	his	1457	“ Aye , but you know I say it with love , lass . Always with love . ”
91973	91976	92006	92006	You	1462	“ Barely contained ”
92203	92205	92252	92253	Michael Maddox	61	“ risqué ”

93118	93122	93123	93123	I	0	“ Holy cow , ”
93134	93140	93123	93123	I	0	“ I got the position ! ”
93191	93201	93212	93212	he	95	“ Cam ! Are you home ? Open up ! ”
93205	93209	93212	93212	he	95	“ Comin ’ ! ”
93250	93255	93224	93225	a woman	311	“ Um . . . ”
93256	93259	93260	93260	He	95	“ What ? ”
93266	93281	93260	93260	He	95	“ Oh , this ? It was in Kellen ’s closet . Looked comfy . ”
93285	93290	93282	93282	He	95	“ It is comfy . “
93291	93314	93315	93315	He	95	“ I admire that for such a big , manly man , you have very open ideas about gender - specific clothing . ”
93318	93347	93315	93315	He	95	“ Whoever made that rule that pink is only for girls is dumb . I ’ll have you know , pink is very flatterin ’ to my complexion . ”
93362	93383	93384	93384	I	0	“ Moving on — I got the promotion ! You ’re looking at the newest associate editor at Maddox Publishing ! ”
93408	93426	93399	93399	my	0	“ Really ? That ’s fantastic , lass ! Good for you ! You just found out ? ”
93427	93477	93500	93500	him	1495	“ Yes , Michael emailed me the news ! I ’m not supposed to tell anyone until after the first of the year when they make the formal announcement , but I had to tell you . Oh God , wait until my mother hears — she’ll freak out ! ”
93478	93488	93489	93489	I	0	“ You told me before you told your mum ? ”
93502	93536	93489	93489	I	0	“ Why do I feel like that ’s going to be followed with a lecture about how much I ’m in love with you , but I just do n’t realize it yet ? ”
93537	93547	93548	93548	He	1495	“ Because you are , and you do n’t . ”
93557	93577	93578	93578	He	1495	“ This calls for a celebration . You have any of that dark beer you bought for me left ? ”
93621	93634	93635	93635	Cam	95	“ Your ego is your superpower , you know that , prancer ? ”
93665	93678	93679	93679	He	95	“ Oh , no , lass , that ’s not my superpower . ”
93686	93703	93679	93679	He	95	“ You ’re never gon na let me forget I saw you naked , are you ? ”
93704	93720	93722	93722	him	95	“ I ’ll forget it as soon as you do . So no , never . ”
93790	93800	93801	93801	He	95	“ Why are n’t you dressed for bed yet ? ”
93810	93826	93801	93801	He	95	“ It ’s almost ten o’clock on a school night . You need your sleep . ”
93832	93854	93801	93801	He	95	“ You ’ll make a good dad someday , you know that ? You ’re bossy in a very sweet way . ”
93870	93882	93864	93864	I	0	“ Not in love with you . Just making an observation . ”
93883	93898	93864	93864	I	0	“ Well , thank you . I ’ve always wanted to be a father . ”
93899	93913	93864	93864	I	0	“ You have tons of time . What are you , early thirties ? ”
93914	93929	93864	93864	I	0	“ Do n’t tell me you did n’t find out during your investigative research . ”
93948	93987	93937	93937	he	95	“ Ugh . I only looked you up that one time , and I did n’t pay attention to your birth date . So — are you going to tell me , or is it a state secret ? ”
93988	93995	93996	93996	I	0	“ I ’m twenty - nine . ”
94031	94036	94037	94037	he	95	“ Uh - oh , ”
94046	94059	94037	94037	he	95	“ She ’s thinkin ’ . No good can come of this . ”
94100	94130	94092	94092	he	95	“ I remember twenty - nine . It was actually harder than thirty . Once I was over that hump , I accepted I ’d never be young again . ”
94131	94161	94092	94092	he	95	“ Everything ’s relative , lass . There ’s a sixty - year - old grandma out there who ’d give her eyeteeth to be thirty - six again . ”
94162	94184	94092	94092	he	95	“ Oh , thank you for that pearl of wisdom . How comforting to know the elderly are jealous of me . ”
94185	94191	94092	94092	he	95	“ Sixty is n’t elderly ! ”
94192	94217	94092	94092	he	95	“ Dude . Seriously . If the average life expectancy is somewhere in the seventies , sixty is practically knocking on death ’s door . ”
94218	94231	94092	94092	he	95	“ One of my grandmothers lived to be one hundred and fourteen . ”
94232	94240	94092	94092	he	95	“ What ? That ’s a lie ! ”
94241	94259	94260	94260	I	0	“ Nope . And my other grandmother is one hundred and ten . She ’s still alive . ”
94267	94279	94260	94260	I	0	“ Now you ’re just trying to make me feel better . ”
94280	94314	94092	94092	he	95	“ I ’m not pullin ’ your leg ! The McGregor clan has exceptional genes , lass . Nobody in my family even starts thinkin ’ about retirin ’ until well after ninety . ”
94315	94318	94092	94092	he	95	“ Really ? ”
94319	94367	94368	94368	He	1505	“ Really . If you ever visit Scotland , I ’ll take you to meet Nanny O’Shea . That ’s my mum ’s mum . You two would get a kick out of each other — same sharp tongue and lack of respect for the McGregor men . ”
94402	94509	94510	94510	I	0	“ My dad ’s mother is eighty . We call her Granny Gums because she loves to horrify people by popping out her dentures during conversations like it ’s an accident . She has mild dementia , so she repeats herself a lot , but otherwise she ’s in pretty good shape . My other grandmother is in perfect health , but you would n’t know it by the way she carries on . She had a Just Buried party when she turned fifty because she was convinced she was about to kick the bucket any minute . She was a model , like my mom . ”
94569	94585	94586	94586	Cam	95	“ Those people do not age gracefully , and I ’m not talking about wrinkles . ”
94603	94606	94598	94598	he	95	“ What ? ”
94607	94635	94663	94664	The man	323	“ Clink your glass with me , lass . That ’s the first time you ’ve said somethin’ sensible about age , looks , or your family . ”
94636	94645	94598	94598	he	95	“ Maybe you ’re rubbing off on me . ”
94673	94694	94663	94664	The man	323	“ I have a chicken breast and some veggies left over from dinner I could reheat if you ’re hungry . ”

94741	94751	94732	94732	I	0	“ Oh , shut up , you big baby . ”
94903	94915	94917	94917	Cam	95	“ So what else did pretty boy say in his email ? ”
94933	94948	94954	94954	he	95	“ My laptop ’s on the bed if you want to check it out . ”
94981	94986	94976	94976	he	95	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
94987	94998	94976	94976	he	95	“ I like him better in email than in person . ”
95006	95020	95021	95021	My	0	“ Oh ho ! So you admit Mr. Repressed has a cute side ! ”
95027	95065	95066	95066	His	95	“ I said no such thing . Let ’s not get carried away , lass . I ’m just admittin ’ he might have a certain charm in electronic communications that does n’t translate into real life . ”
95070	95084	95066	95066	His	95	“ Even if he was tryin ’ to get you to send nudes . ”
95085	95113	95021	95021	My	0	“ Yeah , but I remembered what you said about dropping crumbs , so I took your advice and sent him a picture of my earlobe instead . ”
95114	95130	95131	95131	He	95	“ Seems like it worked . Pretty boy ’s fallin ’ all over himself here . ”
95142	95161	95131	95131	He	95	“ Did you read this part about the policy against subordinates and supervisors bein ’ in a relationship ? ”
95176	95196	95162	95162	I	0	“ Yeah . It ’s a bummer , but I guess we ’ll just have to be extra careful . ”
95197	95213	95214	95214	I	0	“ Extra careful as in not sendin ’ emails like this over the company server ? ”
95219	95223	95214	95214	I	0	“ Oh shit . ”
95224	95235	95236	95236	Outraged	227	“ Aye , oh shit is right . Dumb ass . ”
95245	95255	95238	95238	I	0	“ Did you just call me a dumb ass ? ”
95256	95287	95214	95214	I	0	“ I ’m callin ’ him a dumb ass , because he is , because he should fucking know better ! He ’s the CEO , for Christ ’s sake ! ”

95307	95327	95328	95328	He	95	“ Aye . But you ’re a woman in love . They ’re always blind as fuckin ’ bats . ”
95334	95381	95328	95328	He	95	“ Sorry . Not to lump you in with the rest of your gender , but in my personal experience , a woman loses her damn mind when she falls in love . And most of the time she loses herself in the process , too . ”
95410	95477	95392	95392	I	0	“ I ’ll go in and delete everything later . I ’ll make sure he does , too . I do n’t think there ’s anything too incriminating . We ’re not admitting we ’re in a relationship , we ’re just talking about the possibilities . Besides , it wo n’t be a problem unless someone is looking for something , which they are n’t . ”
95622	95640	95611	95611	I	0	“ You havin’ a breakdown over there , lassie ? Do I need to call the paramedics ? ”

95784	95804	95805	95805	He	95	“ Why are you eating so late , anyway ? You told me I should n’t eat after seven p.m. ”
95913	95922	95923	95923	he	95	“ Did n’t eat today except for lunch , ”
95935	95955	95923	95923	he	95	“ Do n’t have much in the apartment except stuff for our mornin ’ shakes and the odd sandwich . ”
95956	95973	95974	95974	He	95	“ So go shopping ! What have you been doing for dinner since our last supper ? ”
95979	95982	95974	95974	He	95	“ Nothin’ . ”
95987	96008	96009	96009	He	95	“ You have n’t been eating ? How do you have the energy to do our workouts in the morning ? ”

96038	96074	96075	96075	Cam	95	“ Okay . That ’s it . We ’re going back to our nightly dinners . I ca n’t have my trainer dying on me — I’m almost halfway to my weight - loss goal . ”
96093	96102	96083	96083	He	95	“ You have a specific number in mind ? ”
96103	96130	96075	96075	Cam	95	“ Yeah . Forty pounds . What did you think this was about , my love for kale and early - morning jogs in subzero temperatures ? ”
96131	96145	96075	96075	Cam	95	“ Forty pounds ? I thought you just wanted to get into shape ? ”
96146	96153	96154	96154	He	95	“ I do ! I am ! ”
96172	96184	96154	96154	He	95	“ What ’s that look ? You ’re making me nervous . ”
96185	96214	96075	96075	Cam	95	“ It ’s your body , lass . If you wanna shrink it , that ’s your decision . But if I could offer an opinion . . . ”

96226	96290	96222	96222	He	95	“ You look great . Truly . If you were payin ’ me to be your trainer , I ’d advise you to stop tryin ’ to lose weight and focus on healthy eatin ’ habits and gainin ’ strength , endurance , and flexibility from your workouts . And , most importantly , practicin ’ gratitude for the body you ’ve got . ”
96291	96295	96296	96296	I	0	“ Practicing gratitude , ”
96303	96342	96300	96300	He	95	“ You ’re healthy . You ’re whole . Your body does whatever you ask it to . There are millions of people who live with chronic pain or physical disabilities who would gladly trade places with you . ”
96357	96467	96354	96354	he	95	“ Your body is n’t a thing to be looked at and judged against some standard of perfection that does n’t even really exist . It ’s the vessel that takes you through life , allowin ’ you to experience all the beautiful things life has to offer . Food . Sex . Sunsets . Music . Hugs . Laughter . A healthy body is a gift . Do n’t take it for granted . Do n’t treat it like some cheap one - night stand . Treat it like the love of your life . Treat it with respect and tenderness , but most of all , gratitude . “

100409	100438	100439	100439	His	61	“ Yeah , we ’re past that . Get to the important part where you ’re attending the company holiday party together , looking all married and happy . ”
100444	100488	100439	100439	His	61	“ My father thought it would be good for morale . You know , for the staff to see that things are calm and friendly between us . Many times in cases like ours , family companies are broken up in bitter divorces . ”
100525	100557	100521	100521	he	61	“ We do n’t have a prenup . If Elizabeth wanted to , she could insist on the sale of the company so the proceeds could be evenly split between us . ”
100569	100588	100589	100589	Michael	61	“ But the company ’s been around for a million years ! Way before you two were married ! ”
100592	100678	100589	100589	Michael	61	“ Yes . It has . But since I took over as CEO , we ’ve tripled in size , and so have our profits . She could argue in court that those profits are marital assets . I ’d fight it , of course , but if I lost , I ’d have to buy her out to the tune of more than one hundred million dollars . I do n’t have that kind of cash . The only way would be to sell . ”

101127	101140	101141	101141	He	61	“ That only makes it more exciting , do n’t you think ? ”

101191	101204	101205	101205	he	61	“ I could n’t stop thinking about you while I was gone , ”
101253	101273	101274	101274	He	61	“ You enjoyed teasing me over email , did n’t you ? Sending me that photo of your earlobe . ”
101282	101298	101274	101274	He	61	“ Clever . If it was your plan to make me obsessed , it worked . ”
101311	101320	101305	101305	he	61	“ No , there was really no plan — ”
101372	101380	101381	101381	He	61	“ Michael ! You ’re hurting me ! ”
101404	101436	101388	101388	I	0	“ Dude ! Get a grip ! I ’m not making out with you in a bathroom ! In case you did n’t hear me , I just said cool it ! ”

101607	101614	101615	101615	He	61	“ She likes to play rough . ”

101661	101668	101656	101656	he	61	“ Stop . Michael , stop ! ”
101669	101707	101708	101708	He	61	“ Oh , come on , Joellen , do n’t be coy . We both know what we ’re doing . You wanted a promotion , right ? Did you think those were handed out for free ? ”
101754	101766	101780	101780	His	61	“ Are you kidding me right now ? I said stop ! ”

103134	103149	103150	103150	Cam	95	“ No , but you ’re biased because you ’re in love with me . ”
103395	103439	103371	103371	he	95	“ I ’m gon na get you naked . Then I ’m gon na make love to you . Then you ’re gon na tell me if you want it sweet and tender again , or if you want it dirty and hard . ”
103607	103617	103618	103618	I	0	“ Forget about making love to me , Cam , ”

104286	104325	104283	104283	Cam	95	“ Wanted to do that since the second I laid eyes on you , standin ’ at my door in that ugly green sweater , tellin ’ me to turn the music down , all curves and sass . ”
104438	104447	104448	104448	He	95	“ I have to get this dress off . ”

105505	105516	105492	105492	We	1657	“ What did you need a change of scenery for ? ”
105525	105535	105521	105521	Cam	95	“ My life had become . . . unmanageable . ”
105585	105592	105580	105580	I	0	“ That teenager , you mean . ”
105593	105633	105521	105521	Cam	95	“ Aye . Among other things . I was drinkin ’ way too much . Lashin ’ out at everyone . I ’ve never been great at dealin ’ constructively with my anger , even after years of therapy . ”
105634	105643	105580	105580	I	0	“ You were in therapy ? For years ? ”
105644	105738	105521	105521	Cam	95	“ I worked on my head as hard as I worked on my body . Ca n’t say the effect was as successful , but yeah . Therapy . Seein ’ how badly my mum was mind fucked by life , I ’ve always been into self - improvement . I also read a lot . Everything , really , biographies to history to politics . I did n’t go to college — gettin ’ through secondary school with a learnin ’ disability was tough enough — but I do love to read . ”
105795	105807	105808	105808	He	92	“ You do n’t seem particularly angry to me , prancer . ”

105904	105932	105933	105933	He	92	“ The lawsuit you ’re in , the one I overheard you talking with someone on the phone about . Is it related to the pregnant teenager ? ”
105936	105945	105933	105933	He	92	“ She ’s suin ’ me for paternity . ”
105956	105984	105950	105950	he	92	“ I ’m not the father , lass . I might not be a pillar of morality , but I know enough to steer clear of adolescents . ”
105985	106007	105950	105950	he	92	“ I know . I believed you before when you told me it was n’t true . How old is she ? ”
106008	106011	105950	105950	he	92	“ Sixteen . ”
106012	106022	106023	106023	His	92	“ Oh my God ! She ’s a child ! ”
106028	106064	106023	106023	His	92	“ You would n’t say that if you saw her picture . Or got a look inside her mind . She ’s a cunning little thing . Wants attention , knows how to get it . ”
106065	106094	106095	106095	He	92	“ I think you ’d better just tell me the story , because I ’m cooking up some really scary scenarios in my mind right now , Cam . ”
106107	106176	106095	106095	He	92	“ The story , to put it in a nutshell , is that I ’m a target . A big dumb bulls - eye . I ’ve done myself no favors with the way I act — drunk and disorderly , my ‘ dating ’ history , so to speak . My barrister thinks it ’s a miracle I have n’t seen more of these kinds of accusations . ”
106183	106187	106177	106177	His	92	“ Lucky me . ”
106199	106251	106196	106196	he	92	“ I had a party at my house . I was always havin’ parties . Havin’ people around makes me feel better . Less . . . antsy . My house was always filled with people . Friends — if you could call them that — teammates , strangers , whoever . ”
106320	106480	106481	106481	I	0	“ One night over the summer , this guy brings his sister . She looks twenty , at least . Full makeup , high heels , the works . The party gets wild . By three a.m. , I ’m passed out on the lawn in the backyard . When I wake up in the mornin ’ , the place is a wreck and everyone ’s gone except this girl , who I find cryin ’ in my kitchen , lookin ’ a mess . I ask her what ’s wrong , she says her brother left and she has no way home . So , idiot me , I offer to drive her . And that ’s it . That ’s all I did : drove her home . The next week I got a visit from the police , who wanted to discuss how I ’d like to plead to sexual coercion under the Sexual Offences Act . ”
106498	106509	106481	106481	I	0	“ So she claimed the two of you had sex ? ”
106510	106615	106616	106616	He	1668	“ Aye . I was drunk , but I bloody well was n’t drunk enough to forget that . I never saw her after she first came in . So my legal team interviews everyone from the party , and it turns out no one can corroborate her bein ’ near me at any time . Because there was no physical evidence , either , and she had no witnesses to back up her story , the charges were n’t filed . But by then the news had picked up the story . I was called everything from a child molester to a rapist . ”
106634	106644	106616	106616	He	1668	“ That kind of stink does n’t wash off . ”
106645	106654	106481	106481	I	0	“ Oh , Cam . That ’s awful . ”
106655	106682	106616	106616	He	1668	“ That ’s not even the worst part . Two months later , she finds out she ’s pregnant and files a paternity suit against me . ”
106683	106702	106616	106616	He	1668	“ But all it would take would be a DNA test to prove you ’re not the father ! ”
106703	106766	106616	106616	He	1668	“ Aye . Which she wo n’t submit to , claiming it can hurt the unborn child . So I ’m stuck waitin ’ until she gives birth so we can get the bloody test done and prove I ’m innocent . In the meantime , she ’s all over the news , cryin ’ about how I took advantage of her . ”
106774	106785	106786	106786	He	1668	“ But that ’s not fair ! She ’s lying ! ”
106793	106858	106786	106786	He	1668	“ That ’s the price I have to pay for refusin ’ to settle the suit . Her barristers offered me a deal to keep her quiet , but I refused because that ’s blackmail . It ’ll all come out in the wash once the baby ’s born , but until then , it ’s a circus with me in the center ring . ”
106859	106871	106872	106872	He	1668	“ But ca n’t you countersue her for defamation of character ? ”
106876	106916	106872	106872	He	1668	“ If anyone ’s to blame for my character assassination , lass , it ’s me . And she ’s a child who ’s obviously messed up in the head . What good would it do in the end ? ”
106923	106944	106945	106945	He	1668	“ I wish there was something I could do to help . I hate that you ’re going through this . ”
106956	106971	106947	106947	his	1668	“ You ’ve already helped , lass . You have no idea how much . ”
107016	107026	107010	107010	he	1668	“ This is gon na sound so fucking weird . ”
107027	107033	107034	107034	He	1668	“ I ’m already worried . ”
107042	107050	107034	107034	He	1668	“ You remind me of my mother . ”
107051	107091	107092	107092	He	1668	“ Speaking of awkward segues ! I ’ll just be here trying not to be icked out by that , thanks . You could n’t wait to lay that gem on me until we were n’t naked in bed ? ”
107095	107108	107109	107109	He	1668	“ I know . Sorry . What I mean is . . . ”
107120	107149	107150	107150	His	1668	“ How you ’re a natural caretaker . How you know how to make people feel good about themselves without tryin ’ . How you ’re always honest . ”

107184	107193	107181	107181	I	0	“ You ’re killing me here , prancer . ”
107211	107224	107194	107194	He	1668	“ Are we gon na talk about the elephant in the room ? ”
107261	107280	107245	107245	I	0	“ Do you have a name for that thing ? Because I ’ve secretly been calling it Godzilla . ”
107281	107298	107299	107299	I	0	“ I ’m not talkin ’ about my dick , lass , and you know it . ”
107313	107334	107299	107299	I	0	“ Have I ever mentioned that you have beautiful breasts ? Because you do . Man breasts are highly underrated . ”
107343	107355	107356	107356	He	1668	“ I have to go back to Scotland on the third . ”
107389	107406	107386	107386	he	1668	“ Trainin ’ for the new season starts on the sixth or I ’d stay longer — ”
107407	107410	107411	107411	I	0	“ No , ”
107421	107436	107411	107411	I	0	“ You ca n’t stay . You have to go back to your life . ”

107519	107526	107470	107470	His	1668	“ standing out on a ledge . ”
107527	107574	107589	107589	I	0	“ I ’ll buy you a ticket , one with an open - ended return date so you can stay as long as you want . Take some vacation time , see if you like Scotland . . . why ’re you shakin ’ your head ? ”
107575	107582	107583	107583	I	0	“ You know it ’s impossible , ”
107626	107629	107614	107614	I	0	“ Lass — ”
107630	107731	107610	107610	I	0	“ I ’m thirty - six , Cam . You ’re twenty - nine . I ’ve got neuroses older than you . You ’re a glamorous , famous person whose house is always filled with people and parties , and I ’m a homebody who only socializes with my cat . You ’ll end up resenting me . I ’ll end up homesick , feeling like a burden . We both have pretty significant problems we have to fix in our lives , and using each other as crutches is n’t going to do anything but create more messes . ”
107742	107765	107739	107739	Cam	95	“ Wow . That was bloody depressin ’ . Try again . And this time keep it short and just say yes . ”
107838	107998	107813	107813	his	95	“ Number one , I do n’t give a fuck about our age difference . Neither should you . Number two , my house is always filled with people because I ’m lonely , not because I love parties . Two B , my life is n’t glamorous . Before I met you , it was a car goin’ a hundred kilometers an hour straight toward a cliff . Number three , the only thing I ’ll ever resent about you is your relentless commitment to put yourself down . I do n’t have an answer to the possibility that you might get homesick , but I bloody sure would do my best to make sure you feel as at home in my home as you do here . And number fucking four , whatever problems we have in our lives would be made significantly better by bein ’ with the only person either one of us can trust . “
108075	108196	108197	108197	I	0	” There ’s a long , terrible silence in which I stare out the window at the flurries of snow and try my damnedest to keep myself together even though he just completely broke me apart . Normally this is where I ’d burst into tears and hurry home to stress eat . No — that ’s incorrect . Normally there ’s no universe where a smokin ’ hot pink - bathrobe - wearing famous athlete just screwed me silly and invited me to come live with him in Europe , but apparently this is my new normal , so I ’m just going to have to suck it up and deal with it the best way I know how . “
108215	108251	108197	108197	I	0	” Cam starts to laugh , softly at first , but then he gives over to it and collapses against the bed , shaking the mattress and both of us as the gales overtake him . “

108275	108319	108273	108273	lass	1976	” He drags me on top of him — manhandling me in that wonderful way he has that makes me feel tiny and feminine and grateful for his dedication to growing his muscles so large — and gazes up at me , smiling . “
108334	108435	108320	108320	You	2249	” He kisses me , his hands in my hair and a smile on his mouth . He tucks me in under his arm , and I listen to his breathing grow deeper and more even until I know he ’s asleep . I lie next to him and breathe him in one last time , telling myself it ’s for the best if I slip out before he wakes so we can avoid the inevitable morning - after awkwardness . Then I gather my dress and shoes from the floor and tiptoe out , closing the door softly behind me .

Apparently that promotion was a kind of pay - to - play deal , and I was n’t playing . The office is closed until after New Year ’s because of the holidays , but I ’m pretty sure I ’ll be fired first thing when I go back . ”

Nobody ’s interested in what really happened — you’re just going to pin this all on me and throw me out like garbage after ten years of dedicated service ? ”
113674	113701	113664	113664	My	0	“ After I ’ve busted my ass and played by the rules and given you everything I ’ve got , I ’m the one getting punished ? ”

And that was only because I had to get some of my lady parts chopped up and taken out , which is n’t a walk in the park , I ’ll have you know ! I cramped like a mofo and bled out clots the size of important organs for three weeks after that , sitting right out there in that chair ! ”
113854	113857	113850	113850	Ruth	153	“ Joellen . ”

Obviously I ca n’t disclose the specifics of that meeting , but what I can tell you is that Michael has been removed as chief executive officer of this firm . He will not be returning . ”
114169	114182	114166	114166	I	0	“ But . . . I do n’t . . . understand . ”

114601	114611	114591	114591	She	63	“ Ruth . We ’ll be fine . Please . ”
114668	114680	114681	114681	She	63	“ Why have you always been such a bitch to me ? ”
114694	114701	114691	114691	she	63	“ I was n’t expecting that . ”
114702	114736	114737	114737	She	63	“ We ’ll get to the Michael stuff in a sec . But it ’s always really bothered me that you were so mean to me . I could never figure out why . ”
114769	114784	114762	114762	she	63	“ Because you remind me so much of myself , and I hate it . ”
114794	114812	114813	114813	She	63	“ Me ? I remind you of you ? Are you nuts ? We ’re polar opposites ! ”
114824	114848	114821	114821	her	63	“ How I used to be , before I decided to stop letting life kick me in the teeth and grow some balls . ”
114858	114863	114855	114855	her	63	“ So to speak . ”
114889	114930	114879	114879	she	63	“ I always hoped one day you ’d have enough of me clapping at you and clap back . And you did , eventually . After I ’d been through the entire dictionary of names that start with the letter J. ”
114935	114946	114947	114947	She	63	“ Portia , that ’s just . . . diabolical . ”
114954	114985	114947	114947	She	63	“ I had no idea you ’d have so much patience , or I would ’ve sat you down ten years ago and told you to stop being so accommodating . ”
114990	115058	114986	114986	Her	63	“ Being nice is the worst thing a woman can be . Nice means you have to swallow your own feelings and focus on everyone else ’s . Nice means you do n’t speak up when you ’re wronged . Nice means being a people pleaser and a conciliator and worrying yourself to death over others ’ opinions . Nice means never getting what you really want . ”
115059	115073	115074	115074	She	63	“ So we ’re all just supposed to walk around being giant bitches ? ”
115079	115146	115074	115074	She	63	“ That ’s one way to do it . At least you ’ll get respect . But what I really mean is that when you ’re focused on being nice , you wo n’t tell a truth that needs telling , because the worst thing a nice girl could ever do is hurt someone ’s feelings . A better thing to focus on is being real . ”
115147	115150	115151	115151	I	0	“ Real , ”
115155	115190	115151	115151	I	0	“ Authentic . Genuine . Live your truth . Let others live theirs . Do n’t kiss anyone ’s ass , but do n’t be an asshole , either . It ’s very simple . ”
115210	115226	115207	115207	I	0	“ That was interesting . Also weird . I ’m not sure how to respond . ”
115242	115250	115227	115227	Portia	63	“ That ’s exactly what I mean ! ”
115251	115261	115207	115207	I	0	“ Okay , now you ’ve totally lost me . ”
115262	115315	115227	115227	Portia	63	“ Old Joellen would ’ve found some nice , nonoffensive reply . Instead , you were real . Congratulations , there ’s hope for you yet . I was also impressed by your little speech when you came in . Very real . Strong , angry , impressive . Good for you . ”
115316	115350	115351	115351	Portia	63	“ I feel like I might be dreaming all this right now ? Like I ’m in a hospital bed somewhere , dopey on morphine and hooked up to a bunch of tubes ? ”
115375	115420	115421	115421	She	63	“ The associate editor position is yours if you want it . You will , however , have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and a document releasing the firm from any future claim of sexual or emotional harassment arising from this incident with Michael . ”
115429	115482	115425	115425	her	63	“ You wo n’t be able to speak about the incident in the ladies ’ room or your personal relationship with Michael , or publicly disparage Maddox Publishing in any way . If you do , you ’ll be terminated , and the firm will pursue all available legal remedies against you . ”
115486	115497	115425	115425	her	63	“ Wow . And here I thought we were bonding . ”
115504	115538	115501	115501	Portia	63	“ Michael wo n’t be back to the office , so you wo n’t have to deal with him again . On a personal note , I ’d like to apologize to you . ”
115547	115601	115541	115541	her	63	“ I saw this coming . There have been other incidents . It ’s one of the reasons he was removed so quickly . I ’m putting myself at legal risk by telling you that , but I think it ’s important you know that what happened is in no way your fault . ”
115619	115632	115612	115612	her	63	“ Thank you , Portia . That ’s very civil of you . ”
115647	115756	115643	115643	I	0	“ Okay , I ’m going to be real now . This has been a lot to digest . I spent the last ten days thinking I was out of a job , and now I ’ve got the promotion I always wanted . I ’ve spent the last ten years thinking I was in love with a guy who , it turns out , is a prick . I ’ve spent the last month living across the hall from a man who dresses like he ’s auditioning for the circus , has an ego the size of the earth ’s atmosphere , and screws like a champ . ”
115765	115779	115757	115757	I	0	“ Sorry , that last part was probably a little too much reality . ”
115785	115795	115780	115780	Her	1799	“ Do go on . I ’m enjoying this . ”
115796	115817	115818	115818	She	1799	“ I ’m sure you do n’t want to hear about , you know , the sex stuff , though . ”
115823	115860	115818	115818	She	1799	“ Why ever not ? I assume you ’re talking about the big rugged thing who strutted around like a rooster and had all the girls in an estrogen frenzy ? He was quite the stud . ”
115861	115870	115780	115780	Her	1799	“ Well , yeah , but . . . ”
115888	115903	115881	115881	She	1799	“ I mean , it ’s not like that ’s your cup of tea . ”
115912	115940	115881	115881	She	1799	“ I might seem cold to you , Joellen , but I can assure you , a man like that is every woman ’s cup of tea . ”
115941	115947	115948	115948	She	1799	“ Even a lesbian ’s ? ”
115961	115988	115948	115948	She	1799	“ It ’s quite ignorant to assume a strong , no - nonsense , unmarried woman must be a lesbian . That ’s really antiquated thinking . ”
115989	116020	115948	115948	She	1799	“ No , I do n’t think that — Michael told me you were gay . He said your girlfriend was on the board of some charity with his wife . ”
116030	116099	116025	116025	she	1799	“ Michael told you I was gay ? Oh , that ’s funny . No , Joellen , I ’m not a lesbian . I just was n’t interested in Michael , which was a novel experience for him . He ’s a petty little liar . It just goes to show how small he is that he thinks calling me a lesbian is getting revenge . Idiot . ”
116119	116131	116109	116109	I	0	“ He was n’t even really getting divorced , was he ? ”
116132	116168	116173	116173	she	1800	“ No . He ’ll never divorce that dimwitted wife of his . She lets him do whatever he wants . Although now that he ’s out of a job , she might divorce him . ”
116176	116220	116173	116173	she	1800	“ Just sign the papers and put this behind you , Joellen . You deserve the promotion . You ’ve worked hard . Do n’t let this opportunity pass by because of the way it came about . That would be a mistake . ”
116276	116280	116273	116273	I	0	“ Oh shit . ”

116383	116397	116377	116377	She	63	“ Pack ? What are you talking about ? Where are you going ? ”
116411	116414	116398	116398	I	0	“ Scotland ! ”
116653	116656	116648	116648	We	1823	“ Oof ! ”

117010	117020	116999	117000	Mrs. Dinwiddle	83	“ So he finally convinced you , did he ? ”
117036	117043	117023	117023	her	83	“ Convinced me to do what ? ”
117044	117051	117023	117023	her	83	“ Fall in love with him . ”
117064	117109	117059	117059	she	83	“ What on earth did you think he was doing all this time , Ducky ? Going around without shirts and offering to teach you how to kiss and having you make him dinner so he had an excuse to spend time with you ? ”
117125	117135	117136	117136	she	83	“ Oh yes , I know all about it , ”
117142	117167	117136	117136	she	83	“ He was smitten with you from the first . It was so romantic , I just had to help him , my dear ! ”

118682	118704	118677	118677	I	0	“ I ’ll tell you about it later . Now are we going to try to catch this flight or what ? ”
118713	118736	118705	118705	His	1853	“ No , lass . We ’ll get the next one . We ’ve got more important things to do right now . ”
119070	119080	119095	119095	Cam	95	“ What ’re you up to , Miss Snufflebottom ? ”
119157	119175	119145	119145	Pinch	244	“ Making a list . Though I was about to start on your Valentine ’s Day present . ”

119322	119347	119308	119308	Cam	95	“ It might . Depends on how soon you say you ’ll take me to see Nanny O’Shea again . I adore that woman . ”

119599	119612	119613	119613	He	95	“ Sorry . Netflix is my Kryptonite . How ’d you sleep ? ”
119641	119650	119638	119638	he	95	“ Best night ’s sleep of my life . ”
119660	119672	119651	119651	I	0	“ You ’ve said that every morning since I got here . ”
119673	119685	119686	119686	He	95	“ That ’s because every mornin ’ it ’s been true . ”

119716	119736	119737	119737	He	95	“ For the most beautiful man in the world , with a heart almost as big as his ego . ”
119755	119771	119772	119772	He	95	“ I ’ve got things bigger than my heart or my ego , darlin ’ . ”

119841	119861	119836	119836	I	0	“ Oh , excuse me . I forgot I ’m supposed to pay the family jewels their proper respect . ”
119871	119892	119862	119862	Cam	95	“ And most of the time , woman , you do a hoora good job at showin ’ your respect . ”
119902	119914	119915	119915	He	95	“ Most of the time ? What exactly are you implying ? ”
119929	119938	119915	119915	He	95	“ Now who ’s got the big ego ? ”

120227	120254	120219	120219	I	0	“ I do n’t want to be quick this morning . I want to go slow . Long and slow and deep and hard and oh — ”
120289	120297	120286	120286	Cam	95	“ Bloody hell . She ’s early . ”
120311	120320	120321	120321	He	95	“ Sweetie . I have to get that . ”
120363	120381	120382	120382	He	95	“ You ’d give Mrs. Dinwiddle a run for her money in the theatrics department , honey . ”
120473	120478	120494	120494	Her	1891	“ Joellen Bixby speaking . ”
120479	120493	120494	120494	Her	1891	“ Happy Monday , Joellen . It ’s Portia . How are you ? ”
120602	120617	120808	120808	Portia	63	“ I ’m great , Portia . How ’s everything at the home office ? ”
120618	120640	120750	120750	her	63	“ Nothing interesting to report since we last spoke , except Denny has launched into some new seasonally themed fart jokes . ”
120641	120657	120658	120658	Portia	63	“ Oh God . Valentine ’s Day fart jokes ? I ca n’t even imagine . ”
120661	120672	120658	120658	Portia	63	“ Yes . Apparently farts are the screams of trapped — ”
120673	120676	120677	120677	I	0	“ Stop ! ”
120689	120712	120677	120677	I	0	“ I left the country to escape fart jokes — I do n’t need you telling them to me over the phone ! ”
120713	120738	120750	120750	her	63	“ I know for a fact you left the country for a different reason altogether , Joellen . And how is your Scottish baller ? ”
120753	120786	120750	120750	her	63	“ Do n’t let Ruth in HR hear you talking like that or you ’ll get a black mark on your employment record . And he ’s great , thanks for asking . ”
120802	120807	120808	120808	Portia	63	“ He ’s amazing . ”
120812	120846	120808	120808	Portia	63	“ If you ’re about to tell me you need time off for a honeymoon , I ’m about to tell you there are very few places on earth without Wi - Fi — ”
120847	120862	120808	120808	Portia	63	“ Nobody ’s getting married ! We ’re not even talking about that yet ! ”
120880	120903	120873	120873	Portia	63	“ Forgive the impropriety , but you ’re almost forty . You ’ve probably got about half a dozen good eggs left . ”
120904	120924	120808	120808	Portia	63	“ Whoa ! We went from getting married straight to infertility ! Have you been talking to my mother ? ”
120925	120928	120929	120929	she	63	“ No , ”
120932	120977	120929	120929	she	63	“ but I think you ’d be a wonderful mother . No time like the present . So how ’s Beth Addison ’s book coming along ? I ca n’t wait to get that sucker to market . She ’s such a fantastic writer . ”
120978	120988	120808	120808	Portia	63	“ You ’re giving me whiplash here , Portia . ”
120989	121017	121018	121018	She	63	“ Keep up , Joellen . Just because you ’re not in Manhattan any longer does n’t mean I ’ll accept any slack in your mental pace . ”
121021	121032	121018	121018	She	63	“ Or has all the haggis gone to your head ? ”
121078	121108	121051	121051	He	95	“ I would n’t eat haggis if you paid me a billion dollars . Let ’s get back to Beth Addison before this conversation completely goes off the rails . ”
121119	121139	121116	121116	Cam	95	“ We should talk about marriage , though . Considerin ’ I already talked to your parents about it . ”
121199	121210	121192	121192	I	0	“ . . . on track with the dev edit ? ”
121211	121221	121222	121222	I	0	“ What ? Huh ? What ’d you say ? ”
121256	121276	121250	121250	Portia	63	“ I ’m glad I did n’t already patch the rest of the team in — you’re hopeless today . ”
121277	121311	121319	121319	I	0	“ Portia , I ’m so sorry — can I call you back in five minutes ? I ’m having trouble with the connection . I ’m going to get on a landline . ”
121356	121378	121350	121350	he	95	“ Oh , no . She ’s thinkin ’ . I can smell the smoke from all the way over here . ”
121387	121397	121384	121384	I	0	“ You talked to my parents about marrying me ? ”
121398	121402	121403	121403	he	95	“ I know , ”
121409	121485	121403	121403	he	95	“ It ’s a little ridiculous considerin ’ your advanced age , but I when we tell our kids the story about how we fell in love , got married , and lived happily ever after , I wanna be able to say I asked your father for permission . Even though I really just told him I ’d be marryin ’ his daughter , not asked , but that can be our little secret . ”
121519	121535	121503	121503	I	0	“ But I ’ve . . . I ’ve only been here for six weeks . ”
121553	121575	121546	121546	he	1901	“ Yep . And how many times during those six weeks have you told me how much you love it here ? ”
121611	121679	121680	121680	He	1901	“ You love my flat . You love the city . You love workin ’ from home . You love Nanny O’Shea . You love the food — except for haggis — and the people , and the weather , and my mates on the Devils , and sittin ’ in the stands , watchin ’ me play . You love that Mr. Bingley has a girlfriend . ”
121763	121767	121768	121768	he	1901	“ In fact , ”
121781	121800	121768	121768	he	1901	“ I think the only thing you have n’t yet said you love . . . is me . ”
121877	121886	121887	121887	Cam	95	“ I . . . I . . . ”

121992	121996	121997	121997	he	95	“ Go ahead , ”
122000	122077	121997	121997	he	95	“ Tell me how you were in love with me from the start , only you mistook that funny feelin ’ in your stomach for gas . Tell me how I knocked you off your feet from the first moment I opened my mouth and you heard my incredibly sexy voice . Tell me how no other man on earth looks as good in a kilt as I do or makes you laugh like I do . ”
122082	122099	122078	122078	His	95	“ Or makes you scream like I do . Go on , lass . Tell me . ”
122118	122121	122122	122122	I	0	“ Yes , ”
122131	122137	122122	122122	I	0	“ Yes to all that . ”

122207	122223	122224	122224	He	95	“ And how you want to spend the rest of your life just like this . ”
122233	122238	122224	122224	He	95	“ In my arms . ”
122254	122257	122251	122251	I	0	“ Yes . ”
122283	122307	122280	122280	he	95	“ Now tell me you love me , lass . And make it good , ’cause you ’ve made me wait too long . ”
122323	122418	122419	122419	He	95	“ I love you the way I love the smell of old books . I love you the way I love a hot bath on a cold day . I love you the way I love sonnets and ice cream and a swimsuit that does n’t make me look like I ’m made of burrata . I love you the way I love the sun on my face in winter . The way I love a favorite song playing on the radio when I ’m driving home from the beach on a summer day . ”
122450	122502	122447	122447	I	0	“ I love you like I love starry nights , and really crunchy pickles , and discovering an amazing new author , and Sunday mornings in bed with the paper and chocolate croissants . Like I love the way the air smells after it rains . Like I love to laugh . ”
122532	122598	122522	122522	I	0	“ But actually I love you more than all those things combined , Cameron McGregor . I love you like I never knew I could love anything . You ’re more important to me than air itself , and I do n’t ever want to spend a day without you . Because you believed in me , this little ugly duckling finally became a swan . ”
122625	122636	122637	122637	he	95	“ You were always a swan , you bloody idiot , ”
122674	122698	122714	122714	his	95	“ Whatever I am , prancer , I ’m yours . Now kiss me before you say something stupid and ruin the moment . ”

122745	122748	122735	122735	He	95	“ Wait . ”
122754	122757	122735	122735	He	95	“ What ? ”
122758	122768	122737	122737	his	95	“ You have n’t said you ’ll marry me . ”
122769	122781	122782	122782	He	95	“ Well . . . technically , you have n’t asked . ”
