2244	2300	2232	2232	Sierra	37	“ But you must , and if it ’s absolution you seek , what better way to find it than by making Faye happy ? Maybe you ’ll find that in doing so , you ’ll experience the happiness you deserve , too . Because you do , Dion . You deserve to be happy . ”

3508	3539	3500	3500	he	38	“ Have you spoken to Dion recently ? From what I understand , he ’s preparing to move back from London , so he ’ll be here more often now . ”
3621	3644	3645	3645	I	0	“ I ’ve contacted him on numerous occasions and he told me that he ’d get in touch with me when required , ”
3799	3805	3810	3810	his	148	“ Come here , Faye , ”
4027	4038	4039	4039	he	33	“ Need I remind you of what ’s at stake ? ”

4237	4284	4285	4285	he	33	“ Now that a wedding date has finally been set , you ’d better not give him a reason to postpone this marriage any further . Is n’t it bad enough they insisted we wait until you graduated college ? I ’m done waiting , Faye , ”
4301	4397	4296	4296	I	0	“ Luca Windsor disobeyed his grandmother and married his secretary instead of his fiancée . In doing so , he set a precedent that could make things difficult for us . Dion never felt like he had a choice , but he knows better now . With only a few months until the wedding , there ’s no room for mistakes . It ’s time to switch tactics — instead of avoiding him for fear his family realizes how inadequate you are , you must now charm him sufficiently to make him overlook your flaws . ”

4809	4817	4818	4818	Abigail	39	“ Your father is a good man , ”
4847	4913	4914	4914	She	39	“ Just make sure Dion marries you , Faye . Everything will be perfect again once we have the money the Windsors promised us . Your dad has n’t been the same since his company nearly went bankrupt . The mining industry is n’t what it used to be . He ’s doing his best , but he needs the financial help they ’ll provide . ”
4986	5001	5002	5002	I	0	“ I should get ready . I ’d hate to keep Sierra Windsor waiting , ”

5955	5963	5964	5964	he	44	“ They have a Michelin starred restaurant , ”
5967	5981	5964	5964	he	44	“ Though I ’ll gladly get a room if you ’d like one . ”

6504	6546	6547	6547	he	44	“ I suppose in some ways , it is . I always said I ’d be patient with you and that you ’re worth the wait , but I feel like you may have taken those words a little too seriously , ”
6554	6578	6547	6547	he	44	“ Six months before you let me take you out on a real date ? It ’ll be years before we ’re married . ”
6666	6675	6676	6676	he	44	“ You like fish , do n’t you ? ”
6737	6759	6721	6721	He	44	“ Let me order for the both of us . Let me surprise you with something I think you ’ll love . ”
6934	6943	6944	6944	I	0	“ How much does a room here cost ? ”
6983	6988	6989	6989	he	44	“ Not that much , ”
7062	7075	7076	7076	he	44	“ I ’m sure we can get dinner served in our room , ”

7572	7577	7578	7578	He	45	“ The bad news ? ”
7581	7637	7578	7578	He	45	“ She disappeared again shortly before we could apprehend her . It ’s obvious she ’s enjoying the kind of protection only money can buy . Raven ’s father swore that they are n’t helping her , and truthfully , I ca n’t find any proof that he ’s lying . Not yet , anyway . ”
7680	7688	7689	7689	I	0	“ I ’ll ask Xavier for help , ”

9682	9707	9708	9708	She	290	“ We are n’t quite married yet , and our engagement is hardly conventional . You do n’t owe me anything — not yet . ”
9767	9777	9778	9778	she	290	“ I sh - should’ve known b - better , ”
9887	9896	9897	9897	I	0	“ How long has this been going on ? ”
9945	9953	9954	9954	she	290	“ It ’s not what you think , ”
9985	9993	9994	9994	I	0	“ It ’s not what I think ? ”
9997	10010	9994	9994	I	0	“ So you are n’t dating one of my family ’s lawyers ? ”

10394	10416	10384	10384	I	0	“ If anything , it looked an awful lot like you were on your way up to do something else altogether . ”
10452	10463	10464	10464	her	290	“ It really is n’t what you think . We … ”

11213	11249	11206	11206	Her	290	“ Our marriage agreement was made by our families . Neither of us had anything to do with it , and I ’m pretty sure neither of us wants anything to do with it either . ”
11305	11324	11325	11325	she	290	“ Do you really think I want to marry a man who could n’t care less about me ? ”
11334	11371	11325	11325	she	290	“ I ’m pretty sure you changed your phone number weeks ago and never even bothered to tell me . You drew a line between us , Dion , and I stayed firmly on my side . ”

If she goes missing for a week , we should be able to figure out who it is . They ’ll become increasingly agitated and they ’ll slip up . If they do , I ’ll wipe them out . They ’re fucking fools for not taking a Windsor Kiss of Death seriously . ”

16175	16220	16221	16221	He	405	“ In your defense , she was a literal child for most of your engagement , so I think it can be forgiven . However , you now have competition that you would n’t have had if you ’d at least acknowledged her existence . ”
16242	16245	16246	16246	I	0	“ Right , ”
16283	16347	16270	16270	Lex	58	“ If you want your inheritance , you ’ll need her to remain faithful to you while you ’re married , or you ’ll breach Grandma ’s terms . You know what that means , right ? You need to steal her away from her boyfriend . Just because she broke up with him does n’t mean she ’ll stay away from him . ”
16348	16352	16353	16353	I	0	“ Her ex , ”
16372	16387	16388	16388	Ares	47	“ And I ’m pretty fucking certain she ’ll stay away from that fucker . ”
16423	16444	16414	16414	Lex	58	“ Maybe , but we ca n’t really risk her simply keeping her word . You need to take action . ”
16453	16484	16445	16445	He	407	“ Based on conversations I ’ve had with Ares and Luca , I ’ve come to the conclusion that the easiest way to win her over is to seduce her . ”
16508	16514	16515	16515	Ares	47	“ It ’s true though , ”
16518	16529	16530	16530	Luca	43	“ Win over her body and her heart will follow . ”
16533	16547	16530	16530	Luca	43	“ Yep . So long as she wants you , there ’s hope . ”
16757	16765	16766	16766	Sierra	37	“ What are you guys doing here ? ”
16911	16924	16925	16925	she	48	“ Thought you said you were going to Zane ’s house tonight ? ”
16948	16951	16952	16952	he	47	“ Yeah , ”
16955	16970	16952	16952	he	47	“ That ’s what I thought I was doing when I left the office . ”
17022	17032	17033	17033	Sierra	37	“ I see we all had the same idea , ”
17052	17058	17059	17059	she	37	“ Good thing we came , ”
17066	17076	17059	17059	she	37	“ These idiots are clearly thinking with their dicks . ”
17088	17119	17077	17077	She	37	“ You wanna know how to win Faye over ? Ask a woman — or even better , ask a woman who reads romance novels like it ’s her profession . ”
17130	17140	17141	17141	I	0	“ I do not want to win Faye over , ”
17144	17153	17141	17141	I	0	“ I had nothing to do with this . ”
17163	17166	17167	17167	she	48	“ Liar , ”
17263	17272	17273	17273	Val	60	“ Let ’s start with Faye ’s interests , ”
17649	17658	17659	17659	Brianna	61	“ Raven really wanted to be here today , ”
17680	17714	17715	17715	She	61	“ She wanted to help you herself and be here for every one of your fittings , but her schedule is so packed that we ’re having a hard time making it work . ”
17996	18004	18005	18005	Abigail	39	“ It truly is a beautiful dress , ”
18008	18039	18005	18005	Abigail	39	“ You ’re beyond lucky that the Windsors are buying this for you , you know ? There ’s a waitlist of two years for a Raven Windsor wedding gown . ”
18144	18150	18151	18151	she	41	“ Have you seen this ? ”
18262	18287	18288	18288	Chloe	41	“ Did n’t he tell you he was going to London for work ? He ’s neither in London , nor is he working , ”
18308	18362	18299	18299	she	41	“ I thought it was so weird that he ’d tell you he was leaving in person when he ’s clearly never cared about you before , but it looks like it was just to throw you off his scent or something . He probably did n’t want you to suspect the truth . ”
18799	18808	18809	18809	I	0	“ Are you sure money will change everything ? ”
18835	18838	18839	18839	she	39	“ Yes , ”
18854	18860	18839	18839	she	39	“ Of course it will . ”
18950	18980	18981	18981	She	39	“ Just do this for me , please . I know it ’ll change everything . You do n’t remember how he used to be , but I do . ”
18995	19103	18988	18988	her	39	“ Once our debts are paid off , I ’ll put him in rehab . He ’ll resist , I ’m sure , but I know he loves me . The man he is now … that ’s not really him . It ’s the liquor that ’s making him act that way . Deep down , he ’s still a good man . He is . Besides , your marriage will pay for Linda and Chloe ’s schooling , and it ’ll open so many opportunities for all three of you . Just trust me , Faye . Everything will get better once you ’re married . ”
19292	19299	19300	19300	she	465	“ Hi , this is Faye , ”
19324	19332	19333	19333	I	0	“ Hi , this is your fiancé , ”
19407	19412	19413	19413	she	465	“ D - Dion , ”
19463	19499	19451	19451	I	0	“ You complained that I had n’t given you my new number , so I thought I ’d better rectify my mistake . Now that you have it , I expect you to use it . ”
19500	19505	19506	19506	she	465	“ Use it how ? ”
19563	19590	19591	19591	I	0	“ You are aware of the uses of a phone number , are you not ? And you ’re acquainted with the functions of your phone ? ”
19602	19610	19611	19611	she	465	“ You want me to call you ? ”
19662	19669	19670	19670	I	0	“ I ’m not that fussy , ”
19674	19685	19670	19670	I	0	“ I ’m fine with you texting me , too . ”
19686	19696	19697	19697	she	465	“ You ’re … you ’re not that fussy , ”
19837	19840	19841	19841	she	465	“ Okay , ”
19846	19872	19841	19841	she	465	“ I ’ll text you , if that ’s what you want . Would you like me to send you updates on my daily activities ? ”
19975	19994	19995	19995	I	0	“ That depends entirely on whether you intend to send me photographic updates of every shower you take , ”
20040	20072	20073	20073	She	465	“ I ’m also open to you sending me videos of various outfit choices for next week ’s charity gala , especially if you keep the camera rolling while you change . ”
20216	20221	20222	20222	she	465	“ You ’re crazy , ”
20225	20258	20222	20222	she	465	“ Make that kind of request again and I ’ll call your grandmother pretending not to understand what you meant . I ’ll act dumb as she scrambles to excuse your words . ”
20355	20364	20365	20365	she	465	“ I - I … I ’m sorry , ”
20370	20375	20365	20365	she	465	“ I did n’t — ”
20376	20380	20381	20381	I	0	“ Do n’t , ”
20386	20443	20381	20381	I	0	“ Do n’t you dare apologize for being real with me , for calling me out on my bullshit . You ’re about to become my wife , Faye . My equal . Hearing you act your part is a fucking delight . Keep fighting me , baby . I ’m loving every second of it . ”
20457	20466	20467	20467	she	475	“ I think you might actually be insane , ”
20588	20591	20592	20592	she	475	“ Dion , ”
20601	20604	20592	20592	she	475	“ Hmm ? ”
20605	20618	20595	20595	her	475	“ I … would it be okay if I asked a question ? ”
20619	20623	20624	20624	She	475	“ Of course . ”
20645	20685	20686	20686	I	0	“ That day at The Lacara , when you told me you were mine as much as I am yours … Those were pretty much your exact words , were n’t they ? What did you mean by that ? ”
20695	20727	20686	20686	I	0	“ I thought it was obvious , Faye . I did n’t think I left much room for misunderstandings . I was referring to mutual fidelity , and you know it . ”
20757	20760	20761	20761	she	475	“ Okay , ”
20839	20854	20855	20855	I	0	“ I ’ll see you next week , at the annual Windsor charity gala , ”
20859	20881	20855	20855	I	0	“ We ’ll talk more then . Try not to miss me too much in the meantime , my darling fiancée . ”
20929	20936	20937	20937	Silas	45	“ What took you so long ? ”
20959	20962	20963	20963	Xavier	49	“ What ? ”
20966	20997	20998	20998	Silas	45	“ You worked us both to the bone only to leave us out of the resolution ? Absolutely not . This is about to be the highlight of my day . ”
21046	21056	21057	21057	I	0	“ I see you did n’t bother gagging her , ”
21063	21085	21060	21060	Xavier	49	“ There ’s no one here to hear her scream . It seemed fun to let her wear herself out needlessly . ”
21217	21222	21223	21223	I	0	“ Hello , Hannah , ”
21251	21263	21246	21246	Silas	45	“ I do apologize for the delay in getting to you . ”
21281	21296	21297	21297	She	46	“ I kept you waiting for six days . How very rude of me . ”
21369	21380	21381	21381	I	0	“ Do you want to guess why you ’re here ? ”
21450	21453	21454	21454	Hannah	46	“ Dion , ”
21471	21492	21463	21463	she	46	“ Please , I have n’t hurt anyone , you know I have n’t . I just … I just … ”
21508	21592	21493	21493	I	0	“ You just … knowingly took what was n’t yours and continued to inflict emotional wounds on the one person that least deserved it . For years , you watched your own sister suffer while you manipulated my brother , taking advantage of his morals and his love for our family . Even once Raven married Ares because you refused to walk down that aisle , you continued to mess with them . Did you really think you would n’t pay for it ? ”
21632	21642	21643	21643	she	489	“ Ares gave me the Windsor Kiss of Death , ”
21653	21710	21643	21643	she	489	“ I paid for what I did . He destroyed my acting career — and not just that . I ca n’t work in the industry at all anymore . Within a matter of months , I ’ve become a nobody . He took the one thing I cared about most . Is n’t that enough ? ”
21728	21843	21844	21844	I	0	“ Considering we caught you at a luxury private resort , I ’m going to say no . It ’s not enough , Hannah . You ca n’t just mess with my family and expect to get away with it . I wo n’t stop until I see you looking the way Raven did each time she saw her designs burned in the streets , each time someone called her a home wrecker when all she ever did was the right thing . I want you to look like your heart is being torn out of your chest while it ’s still beating , and you ’re trying your hardest to breathe through it . ”
21877	21904	21905	21905	I	0	“ You have no idea how tempted I am to carve up that pretty face of yours so Raven will never have to see you again , ”
21908	21987	21905	21905	I	0	“ Ares may have ended your career , but that is n’t good enough for me . Here ’s the thing , Hannah . Ares has values and morals that I do n’t share . He ’s righteous and works within a framework that can be considered socially acceptable . I do n’t . I ’ll do what my siblings ca n’t or wo n’t , and I ’ll do it without an ounce of shame or regret . ”
21988	21999	22000	22000	she	491	“ Y - you wo n’t get away with this , ”
22028	22036	22037	22037	I	0	“ No one is coming for you , ”
22040	22063	22037	22037	I	0	“ That producer that was funding your lavish lifestyle ? The one you ’d been seeing for years behind Ares ’s back ? ”
22074	22082	22071	22071	I	0	“ Yeah , he sends his regards . ”
22083	22088	22089	22089	she	491	“ W - what ? ”
22101	22173	22092	22092	I	0	“ You still do n’t fully realize what you ’ve gotten yourself into , do you ? You do n’t realize that it was n’t just Ares and Raven you wronged . It was all of us . You fuck with one of us , you ’ll feel all our wrath . Ares you survived , but the combination of the rest of us will make you wish you had n’t . ”
22184	22209	22210	22210	I	0	“ Did you know your little producer really wanted to be a father ? Imagine his surprise when I showed him your medical records . ”
22218	22278	22279	22279	I	0	“ Aborting a baby he wanted so desperately … Even I would ’ve let you live out the rest of your life in peace merely for the sake of your unborn child . I guess that ’s why Ares went so easy on you , because the child you carried would ’ve still been Raven ’s niece or nephew . ”
22293	22366	22282	22282	I	0	“ I could n’t risk your little lover changing his mind about you , though . I had to immobilize him . He had no real power , no connections to protect him , just piles of money that he threw around to craft the illusion of influence . All it took was one call to my sister - in - law , Valentina . You remember her , do n’t you ? ”
22385	22461	22462	22462	I	0	“ COO of Windsor Finance and The Windsor Bank ? She did n’t even ask any questions — she just got it done . Three days , and he ’d tragically become bankrupt because he ’d invested in all the wrong companies against her advice . Turns out he ’d allegedly heard rumors from his friends about an exciting new investment . Funny , that . I wonder where all of those rumors came from . ”
22469	22477	22478	22478	I	0	“ What shall we do with her ? ”
22486	22510	22478	22478	I	0	“ You wanna have a go while I mull it over ? I know you were pissed about what she did to Raven . ”
22522	22597	22519	22519	his	45	“ No , I ca n’t get my clothes dirty . My wife picked this outfit for me this morning , and if I come home with blood on me , I ’ll have to explain why . I love her , but I do n’t trust that she wo n’t go to Raven straight away to gloat about what we ’ve done , and I know you do n’t want Rave to know . ”
22601	22606	22607	22607	he	49	“ So just change ? ”
22613	22652	22610	22610	Silas	45	“ If I come home wearing a different outfit , you might as well put that scalpel to my throat yourself . My little psycho will definitely demand an explanation if I do something as stupid as that . ”
22662	22674	22675	22675	I	0	“ Do you have a vial of that stuff I like ? ”
22708	22718	22719	22719	I	0	“ Here ’s what we ’re going to do , ”
22723	22738	22719	22719	I	0	“ You can either drink the poison in this bottle and end things now . ”
22760	22836	22837	22837	I	0	“ But I ’m not entirely heartless , so I ’ll give you an easy reprieve on account of your ties to my sister - in - law . I ’m highly concerned that she ’d blame herself for anything that I might do to you , so I ’m reluctant to do permanent damage . I do n’t give a fuck about you , but I absolutely can not risk hurting Raven any further . ”
22848	22851	22852	22852	he	49	“ No , ”
22855	22859	22852	22852	he	49	“ Whatever you — ”
22867	22877	22878	22878	I	0	“ The Kingstons are looking for a new maid , ”
22881	22902	22878	22878	I	0	“ Work for them for five years , serving every one of those people you thought you were better than . ”
22927	23005	22914	22914	she	496	“ We ’ll put you in a pretty maid costume , and you can serve drinks and dinner at every big event that everyone you know will be present at . I ’ll have you clear their plates and take their coats , and we ’ll even pay you a little salary . No more luxury escapes , no more pretending you simply retired . I ’m going to ensure you get the attention you always wanted . ”
23162	23170	23171	23171	she	46	“ I … I ’ll do it , ”
23178	23186	23171	23171	she	46	“ I ’ll work for the Kingstons . ”
23218	23224	23225	23225	I	0	“ It ’s so cute , ”
23228	23237	23225	23225	I	0	“ that you think you had a choice . ”
23241	23249	23250	23250	Mom	35	“ What ’s bothering you , honey ? ”
23331	23334	23335	23335	I	0	“ Mom , ”
23342	23357	23335	23335	I	0	“ I miss you so much , every single day . We all do . ”
23378	23385	23386	23386	she	46	“ You ’re all grown up , ”
23395	23425	23386	23386	she	46	“ Ares and Luca are married now , and soon you will be too . I wish I could ’ve been there to watch your brothers say I do . ”
23426	23430	23431	23431	I	0	“ Me too , ”
23434	23462	23431	23431	I	0	“ You ’d love Raven and Val . They ’ve become family , and I just know you ’d love them like they ’re your own daughters . ”
23478	23522	23463	23463	She	497	“ You know it ’s your fault , right ? It ’s your fault I did n’t get to see any of you grow up . It ’s your fault that the only time you get to see me is in your dreams . ”
23536	23540	23541	23541	I	0	“ Forgive me , ”
23544	23562	23541	23541	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry , Mom . I regret it more than you ’ll ever know . ”
23574	23580	23581	23581	she	497	“ You ’re a monster , ”
23584	23667	23581	23581	she	497	“ You know that , do n’t you ? It ’s why you held back with Hannah . You ’re scared Raven will find out , and she ’ll stop looking at you like you ’re the brother she never had . You did n’t show Hannah mercy because you felt sorry for her — you have no remorse . You did it in a misguided attempt to prove to yourself that you ’re not vicious . It ’s laughable , really . ”
23668	23671	23672	23672	I	0	“ Mom , ”
23698	23711	23694	23694	she	498	“ I … I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to — ”
23712	23725	23726	23726	she	498	“ What will Faye think when she discovers who you truly are ? ”
23740	23781	23726	23726	she	498	“ You tried to stay away from her for years because you were scared that if you let her in , she ’d hate what she ’d find as much as I do . Your time is up , Dion . ”
23793	23873	23782	23782	Mom	35	“ If you ’d been a better person , perhaps she might one day have forgiven you for what you did to her mother , Dad , and me . But you ’re not repentant , are you ? You ’re worse now than you were then . Soon , she ’ll realize that , and then she wo n’t even give you those fake smiles of hers . I hope you drown in an ocean of her tears . ”
25014	25020	25021	25021	Chloe	41	“ This dress is unreal , ”
25033	25053	25021	25021	Chloe	41	“ I ca n’t believe you get to wear a genuine Raven Windsor couture gown . That ’s crazy . ”
25487	25516	25517	25517	Chloe	41	“ Do you think they ’ll photograph you in this the way they always do with the Windsors ? Maybe they ’ll put you in the gossip magazines ! ”
25547	25552	25553	25553	I	0	“ I doubt it , ”
25557	25604	25553	25553	I	0	“ The only photographers allowed at the Windsors ’ annual charity gala all get their cameras checked before leaving the venue . Even if they take photos of me , they wo n’t be allowed to keep them . Windsor Media wo n’t let that happen . ”
25674	25689	25690	25690	she	41	“ This is so pretty . I really want to wear it to prom , ”
25693	25724	25690	25690	she	41	“ That ’d be wicked . We ’ll have to get it tailored , though . Or maybe once you ’re married you can just get me a new one . ”
25871	25895	25896	25896	she	41	“ It ’s so unfair that you keep getting these nice things while we ’re left with your hand - me - downs , ”
25911	25992	25896	25896	she	41	“ You ’re literally about to dance the night away at an event that most celebrities ca n’t even get an invite to , and I have to sit at home . As if that ’s not bad enough , now I also have to suffer because of your mistakes , and I do n’t even get anything in return . At least you got all kinds of things from the Windsors out of it , but what about me ? ”
26006	26077	26001	26001	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Chloe . I never meant for any of this to happen . I thought … Father has never hurt you before , so I thought you ’d be safe if I just kept trying my best . I ’ll do better , I promise . I ’ll do everything I can to make sure he has no reason to be angry with any of us . ”
26122	26159	26114	26114	She	535	“ If you ’re really sorry , then let me come to the charity gala . I really want to go , Faye . Why is it that only you ever get to attend these things ? ”

26186	26253	26183	26183	I	0	“ I do n’t … I do n’t hold any sway with the Windsors . The guest list is carefully curated , and if I ask them to make an exception for me , it could upset them or make them feel like I ’m taking advantage of their kindness . What do you think would happen if Father heard about me making such a request ? ”
26474	26477	26478	26478	he	38	“ Faye , ”
26485	26509	26478	26478	he	38	“ From what I understand , Dion only just came back this morning . He stayed in London until the very last second . ”
26526	26534	26535	26535	he	38	“ He did n’t come back alone , ”
26543	26555	26535	26535	he	38	“ His secretary , Maria , is moving back with him . ”
26646	26674	26675	26675	he	38	“ You ’ll need to keep an eye on Maria . He ’s with her every second of every day , and he has been for years , ”
26809	26843	26844	26844	he	38	“ You need to steal Dion ’s attention away from Maria and keep him happy . In that pretty dress , even you should be able to keep him enticed for a night , ”
26848	26920	26844	26844	he	38	“ Every single year , he takes you home within an hour of you arriving at the gala . Tonight , you need to make sure he keeps you around until the end of the night . If you dare come home before then , you can sleep outside , you hear me ? I ’ll give both Chloe and Abigail a new bruise for every minute you ’re home early . ”
26940	26952	26953	26953	he	38	“ Do you need another reminder of what ’s at stake ? ”
26972	26977	26978	26978	I	0	“ No , Father , ”
27077	27130	27057	27057	he	148	“ If you ca n’t get to Dion , you will need to start charming everyone around him . By the time you walk down that aisle , you ’ll need to be entrenched in his life so thoroughly that there ’s no way out for him without letting down his family . ”
27466	27469	27470	27470	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
27523	27526	27527	27527	she	552	“ Dion , ”

28485	28491	28492	28492	I	0	“ That I ’m yours . ”
28508	28528	28492	28492	I	0	“ If you do n’t hold my hand , I might get lost in the crowd . Then what ? ”
28549	28586	28539	28539	she	552	“ Dion , you ’re a giant . You ’re at least six - foot - three . I ’m relatively certain you can look over everyone ’s head . I think you ’ll be fine . ”
28599	28613	28596	28596	my	0	“ No , I do n’t think I ’ll be fine without you . ”

28849	28882	28845	28845	her	552	“ I think that might be the first time I ’ve ever seen you smile , you know ? A real smile , not the ones you usually wear in my presence . ”
28927	28939	28940	28940	She	552	“ What can I say to make you do that again ? ”
28976	28985	28956	28956	she	552	“ You want to … make me smile ? ”
29009	29060	29061	29061	She	552	“ Well , that ’s what I meant , yes , but you ’ve just given me a better challenge . I think I might need to hear you laugh for me again . In fact , I dare say that my enjoyment of this evening greatly depends on it . ”
29188	29192	29193	29193	she	552	“ Another dance ? ”
29202	29213	29193	29193	she	552	“ You do n’t have an escape plan ready tonight ? ”
29251	29254	29255	29255	I	0	“ No , ”
29258	29295	29255	29255	I	0	“ I ’m all out of excuses , and we ’re both out of time . Before the year is over , you ’ll be my wife . There ’s no avoiding this , not anymore . ”
29308	29312	29313	29313	she	552	“ I know , ”
29381	29390	29391	29391	I	0	“ That question you asked over the phone , ”
29414	29419	29391	29391	I	0	“ What prompted it ? ”

29572	29614	29566	29566	she	552	“ Promise me you wo n’t be angry when I give you my answer , and that you wo n’t punish me for intruding on your privacy . I know that our marriage is n’t real , and I would n’t … ”
29615	29619	29620	29620	I	0	“ Tell me , ”
29623	29642	29620	29620	I	0	“ I wo n’t be mad at you , baby . Just tell me what prompted that question . ”
29663	29724	29648	29648	her	552	“ I asked because of those photos of Maria and you at the beach . The ones that The Herald posted . You told me you were going back to London for work , and then you were photographed half - naked with your secretary on a beach in Spain , and I just was n’t sure what to think . ”
29750	29755	29756	29756	she	552	“ I ’m sorry , ”
29759	29808	29756	29756	she	552	“ I should n’t … I should n’t have asked . It ’s clear that … that you did n’t want me to know . I can turn a blind eye , Dion . Of course I can . I ’d always expected that I ’d have to . ”
29809	29815	29816	29816	I	0	“ Please look at me , ”
29885	30011	29879	29879	I	0	“ Faye , I know this may be hard to believe , but I was there to facilitate a joint acquisition between Sierra and Zane . Sierra is buying the grounds the hotel I was visiting is built on , while Zane is acquiring the hotel itself . I may have been in my swim wear , but it was only because the CEO demanded that we complete our negotiations while spending a day at the beach , having lunch and using all the facilities . I have n’t seen the photos , but I can assure you it is n’t what it looked like . From the moment I told you I was yours , I truly have been . I always will be . ”
30408	30411	30422	30422	him	148	“ Faye , ”
30433	30447	30448	30448	He	148	“ Anne Windsor is picking you up in ten minutes . Be ready . ”

30735	30748	30749	30749	he	148	“ You should be grateful she wants to see you at all , ”
30757	30797	30749	30749	he	148	“ You ’d better act grateful and civilized . If I hear one bad thing about your meeting today , I ’ll ensure Chloe wo n’t be able to walk out of this house for at least a week . ”
30833	30838	30839	30839	I	0	“ Yes , Father , ”
31048	31055	31056	31056	I	0	“ Good afternoon , Grandma Anne , ”
31093	31103	31104	31104	she	439	“ I ’m so glad you could make it , ”
31136	31161	31129	31129	she	439	“ Something always seems to come up when I ask you to come over . I was starting to think you were avoiding me . ”

31229	31234	31235	31235	she	439	“ Hi , Faye , ”

31511	31560	31507	31507	she	62	“ Dion is having it renovated , and I thought you might want to decorate it yourself . Maria is here to help with anything you might want to order . Dion has n’t hired a local personal assistant yet , so she ’s filling in for now , ”
31565	31585	31561	31562	Grandma Anne	34	“ Usually , she does n’t handle any of Dion ’s personal errands , but she will for now . ”
31758	31777	31778	31778	she	62	“ Dion and I designed this part of the house so that there ’s plenty of open space , ”
31793	31812	31778	31778	she	62	“ All of this glass brings so much natural light into the house , especially in the morning . ”
31907	31919	31920	31920	she	62	“ The pool is probably my favorite part of the house , ”
31923	31934	31920	31920	she	62	“ It ’s the only thing we did n’t change . ”
32137	32148	32149	32149	Maria	62	“ I was thinking of adding a large round sofa , ”
32153	32171	32149	32149	Maria	62	“ Probably gray . I think I ’ll go with a dark marble dining table as well . ”
32266	32269	32274	32274	her	34	“ Maria , ”
32278	32295	32270	32271	Grandma Anne	34	“ You ’re here to take orders from Faye . Your decorating recommendations are not welcome . ”
32348	32354	32355	32355	she	62	“ Tell me , Faye , ”
32364	32385	32355	32355	she	62	“ How would you like to decorate your home ? Just speak your mind , sweetheart . Anything you want . ”
32465	32474	32475	32475	I	0	“ I think Maria ’s ideas sound great , ”
32552	32556	32557	32557	I	0	“ I disagree . ”

32774	32782	32765	32765	He	33	“ I decided to re - prioritize . ”
32820	32830	32831	32831	she	34	“ We ’ll leave you to it , then , ”
32834	32848	32831	32831	she	34	“ I doubt you need input from outsiders such as Maria and myself . ”
32978	32985	32986	32986	I	0	“ She wo n’t like that , ”
32991	32998	32999	32999	he	33	“ Who wo n’t like what ? ”
33087	33090	33091	33091	he	33	“ Explain , ”

33163	33195	33160	33160	I	0	“ The way she was speaking made it seem like she intends to spend a lot of time here . She wo n’t like being left out of the decorating decisions . ”

33306	33327	33294	33294	he	33	“ I do n’t share , Faye . That works both ways . I thought I ’d made that clear . ”

33405	33465	33399	33399	he	33	“ I have no intention of being with anyone but you ever again . I ’m not sure what she said , but I ’ll speak to her and remind her that you ’re the one I ’m marrying . I ’ll tell her I belong to you , and only you . Will that make you feel better ? ”

33825	33898	33818	33818	he	33	“ If there ’s one thing my parents taught my siblings and me about marriage , it ’s that communication is key . I ’m inclined to agree with that lesson , despite it not coming easy to me . Our marriage is an unconventional one . We ’re starting off on the wrong foot entirely , and I have no intention of making a bad situation worse by letting misunderstandings fester . ”
33907	33975	33899	33899	He	33	“ I did n’t treat you as my fiancée for years , in part because of your age . Because of it , I pushed you straight into another man ’s arms . That wo n’t happen ever again , you hear me ? You ’re mine now , and I ’m yours — exclusively . I do n’t want there to be any confusion about that . ”

34710	34778	34703	34703	I	0	“ My grandmother informed me that you are to accompany us on our family trip to Hawaii . I ’m as surprised as you are , to be honest . As it turns out , my grandmother royally screwed over Luca and Val , and now she ’s forcing us all to go on this family trip in some kind of misguided attempt to fix her wrongs . ”
34789	34831	34779	34779	I	0	“ Honestly , most of the time , it ’s best not to wonder what goes on in my grandmother ’s mind . It ’s easiest to just do as she says . So here I am , picking you up . ”

34881	34891	34878	34878	she	654	“ I know a thing or two about that . ”
34965	34973	34974	34974	she	654	“ How long will we be away ? ”
35028	35066	35067	35067	She	654	“ I was told to pack for three days , but you ’d better pack for at least a week . I have no doubt my grandmother will keep us there until Luca and Val forgive her . ”

35340	35348	35332	35332	she	654	“ Yes , my grandmother informed him , ”

I did n’t really mind it during our flight , because it genuinely seemed to help you , but I … I do n’t want … ”

I could be in a meeting with several industry leaders , and my thoughts will turn to you . You , Faye . The way you ’ll taste when I finally kiss you for the first time , or the way you ’ll sound when you come for me . Sometimes , when my thoughts wander , they simply lead me to memories of the way you laughed at the charity gala , and I find myself thinking of ways to make you do that again . You , my darling fiancée , are on my mind entirely too often , and I ’m not sure I like it . ”

39741	39747	39748	39748	I	0	“ Do I scare you ? ”
39755	39758	39759	39759	she	34	“ Yes , ”
39762	39771	39759	39759	she	34	“ But not in the way you think . ”
39895	39899	39900	39900	I	0	“ Tell me , ”
39909	39926	39900	39900	I	0	“ How do I scare you ? Tell me , so I can try to change . ”
39947	40110	39933	39933	her	34	“ You … you make me feel like I ’m in stasis , like I ’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop . I do n’t understand you , and I do n’t like that . I ’m aware that you ca n’t get access to your inheritance until we ’re married , and I ’m scared of what will happen to me once you no longer need me . I ’d rather have your cruelty now , than be lulled into a false sense of security . I ’m scared you ’re playing some kind of elaborate game , trying to keep me happy until the wedding , and after that , you ’ll punish me for what I did . If you ’re going to hurt me , I ’d rather you do it now . It ’s not like I can run away , you know ? I ’m as trapped in this arrangement as you are . ”
40133	40178	40128	40128	I	0	“ Those fears will never come to pass , Faye . I swear it . I wo n’t punish you for having a life prior to our marriage , just like I ’ve had mine . What right do I have to do that ? ”
40221	40229	40230	40230	I	0	“ And for what it ’s worth , ”
40233	40239	40230	40230	I	0	“ You scare me too . ”
40254	40258	40259	40259	I	0	“ I do ? ”
40262	40419	40259	40259	I	0	“ You ’re nothing like what I expected . I thought I knew you , but every second we spend together further proves that I do n’t . You scare me , because so far I ’m liking what I ’m discovering . Even worse … I want to find out more . I want to know what hides behind every single one of your fake smiles , what makes you tick , what makes you happy . I ’m dying to find out what makes you moan , how you ’ll feel . I need to know if I can make you gasp the way you did when I kissed your neck on the plane , and which other parts of your body are sensitive . I never expected to want you , and the fact that I do … the fact that I want more than just your body , it ’s fucking terrifying . ”
40465	40475	40476	40476	I	0	“ Did you see the retraction The Herald published ? ”
40480	40576	40476	40476	I	0	“ I demanded they clarify the rumors they instigated about Maria and me . I even supplied additional photos for them to print , proving she and I were neither alone nor on holiday . I wo n’t hurt you if I can help it , Faye . Not even indirectly or unintentionally . I ’m going to be good to you . So fucking good that you wo n’t even remember that fucker . Everything he made you feel , everything he gave you , will pale in comparison to what we ’ll have . ”
40621	40627	40628	40628	she	741	“ I ’m so sorry ! ”

40715	40728	40712	40712	I	0	“ This is why you fucking terrify me , my darling fiancée . ”
40833	40917	40823	40823	she	741	“ You terrify me because you have no fucking idea what you do to me . You make me feel out of control , when control is the one thing I value most in life . When I ’m around you , I can barely think straight , Faye . You drive me fucking crazy , and I wish , I fucking wish my need for you was only physical . If I could fuck you out of my system , I would . ”
41109	41114	41115	41115	she	743	“ D - Dion , ”
41127	41135	41136	41136	I	0	“ You made a mess of me , ”

41651	41654	41655	41655	she	743	“ Dion , ”
41658	41665	41655	41655	she	743	“ Stop , please , I — ”
41685	41690	41691	41691	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”

41945	41949	41950	41950	she	743	“ Thank you , ”

42385	42392	42393	42393	Dion	33	“ Do n’t move , baby , ”
42427	42433	42415	42415	he	33	“ You feel so good . ”

43579	43582	43583	43583	he	148	“ Faye , ”
43614	43619	43620	43620	I	0	“ Is it true ? ”
43638	43641	43642	43642	I	0	“ Yes , ”
43649	43658	43642	43642	I	0	“ But it is n’t what you think . ”
43666	43691	43659	43659	Eric	44	“ Throughout our entire relationship , you were engaged to Dion ? I know he ’s always had a fiancée . Was it you ? ”
43709	43802	43692	43692	I	0	“ It ’s something that was arranged by our parents , Eric . Our mothers … they were best friends , and they arranged this when we were kids . He knows I do n’t want to marry him , and it ’s the same for him . We ’re both being forced into this . If … if things were what you think they are , Dion would n’t have reacted the way he did that day in the hotel . He would n’t have been so calm , so unaffected . ”
43803	43806	43807	43807	he	784	“ Faye , ”
43821	43909	43807	43807	he	784	“ He was n’t unaffected . I ’ve known Dion for years . I might be a little younger than him , but our fathers were friends , so I know what he ’s like . That day … that ’s the angriest I ’ve ever seen him . Nothing ever fazes him , but the way he looked at us … I should ’ve realized it then . His barely restrained anger should ’ve clued me in , but maybe I just wanted to be deceived . ”
43921	43931	43932	43932	I	0	“ I n - never meant to deceive you , ”
43940	43984	43932	43932	I	0	“ I know it ’s hard for you to believe , but every moment between us was real . If I could go back in time , I ’d do it again . I would n’t trade the memories we made for anything . ”
43985	43991	43992	43992	he	785	“ I would n’t either , ”
43995	43999	43992	43992	he	785	“ But Faye — ”
44027	44031	44032	44032	he	33	“ One chance , ”
44042	44055	44032	44032	he	33	“ I gave you one single chance , and you blew it . ”
44056	44059	44060	44060	I	0	“ Dion , ”
44078	44090	44091	44091	he	33	“ You ’d do it all over again if you could ? ”
44100	44105	44091	44091	he	33	“ I … Dion … ”
44132	44139	44140	44140	He	33	“ I just wanted to explain . ”
44164	44168	44169	44169	he	33	“ Oh yeah ? ”
44172	44201	44169	44169	he	33	“ You just wanted to explain that you ’re being forced to marry me ? You just wanted to make it clear that you do n’t want me ? ”
44219	44324	44210	44210	he	33	“ Certainly did n’t fucking seem that way when you moaned against my lips last night , writhing in my lap like you were desperate for my cock . Did n’t really seem that way when I woke up this morning either , with your sweet little body all over mine . Did you think I did n’t realize how fucking wet your pussy was for me ? The way you were pressing up against me , like you wanted nothing more than for me to push my cock deep inside you … yeah , it definitely seemed like you did n’t want me . ”
44348	44360	44361	44361	Dion	33	“ Maybe I just forgot who I was in bed with . ”
44391	44398	44399	44399	he	33	“ You ’re testing my patience , ”
44409	44481	44399	44399	he	33	“ Three months until you become my wife , Faye . You have until then to forget about him . If you do n’t , you ’d better believe I ’ll fuck every memory of him out of you , until all you can think of is me . I ’ll have you screaming my name , over and over again , and then I ’ll make you beg for more . ”
44527	44530	44531	44531	he	786	“ Yeah , ”
44534	44581	44531	44531	he	786	“ I ’m gon na fuck you so good , you ’ll never want anyone else . Just because this is n’t what we wanted does n’t mean we ca n’t make the best of it , Faye . I have every intention of enjoying you . ”
44631	44676	44621	44621	My	0	“ I ’ll wait three months , but not a second longer . From the moment you take my last name , you ’ll be mine . Every fucking inch of you . The sooner you come to terms with it , the better . ”
44677	44682	44683	44683	I	0	“ Are you insane ? ”
44692	44701	44702	44702	He	786	“ H - how … how could you ? ”
44712	44726	44702	44702	He	786	“ Insane ? Baby , you do n’t know the half of it . ”
44753	44763	44764	44764	Zane	57	“ What ’s going on between Faye and you ? ”
44851	44854	44855	44855	I	0	“ Nothing , ”
45038	45047	45048	45048	Lex	58	“ So there ’s no story behind this ? ”
45107	45116	45099	45099	I	0	“ I threw her phone in the ocean . ”

45141	45174	45138	45138	Lex	58	“ Were n’t you supposed to be nice and win her over ? This environment is literally perfect for seduction , and you go and throw her phone into the fucking ocean ? ”
45178	45191	45175	45175	I	0	“ I had a diver retrieve it . I did n’t litter . ”
45197	45207	45208	45208	he	57	“ I think you ’re missing the point here , ”

45487	45552	45484	45484	their	788	“ Please do n’t fuck this up any further , hmm ? Faye is a nice girl , and it ca n’t be easy for her being forced into this . You got to spend your twenties fucking around , but she never got to live a life that is n’t tied to you . Just … just keep that in mind , okay ? ”
45757	45768	45769	45769	she	805	“ I thought you said you ’d be back late , ”
45781	45792	45793	45793	I	0	“ You ’re really fucking beautiful , you know that ? ”
45844	45863	45864	45864	she	805	“ I … I did n’t think … I did n’t think you ever noticed me that way , ”
45955	45982	45983	45983	I	0	“ Did you not hear me when I said I ’ll fuck you so good you wo n’t be able to think of anyone but me ? ”
46049	46068	46069	46069	I	0	“ Or did you miss the part where I told you I ’ll make you beg for more ? ”
46095	46152	46089	46089	her	805	“ I ’m counting down the days , baby . Seventy - four days until you ’re mine . I ca n’t wait to make you come all over my cock , Faye . I ’m going to tease you until your pussy is dripping for me and desperation flickers through those beautiful eyes of yours . ”
46204	46226	46196	46196	her	805	“ You ’re so fucking tiny , beautiful girl . Do you think you ’ll be able to take my cock ? ”
46331	46334	46335	46335	I	0	“ Faye , ”

46488	46501	46485	46485	I	0	“ But one look at you , and I lose all reason . ”

46530	46536	46537	46537	I	0	“ I came to apologize , ”
46561	46588	46546	46546	I	0	“ I should n’t have gotten mad at you , and I definitely should n’t have thrown away your phone . I ’m sorry , Faye . ”

46609	46693	46606	46606	she	805	“ I broke my promise , and there ’s no excuse for that . I truly only picked up because I wanted to explain myself after the article The Herald posted , but I should n’t have . I … I let you down , and I ’m sorry . We might not be married yet , but we will be , and I know that . I know the past has to stay where it belongs . This wo n’t happen again . ”
46710	46715	46716	46716	I	0	“ It better not , ”

47255	47272	47250	47250	she	41	“ Why not ? Dion will just buy you a new one , wo n’t he ? ”
47276	47290	47291	47291	I	0	“ I ca n’t just ask him for a new phone , Chloe , ”
47309	47314	47315	47315	she	41	“ Must be nice , ”
47318	47358	47315	47315	she	41	“ Knowing you ’ll become a Windsor soon . There ’s almost nothing you wo n’t have , huh ? I ’d trade places with you in a heartbeat . At least it ’d make the pain worth it . ”

47874	47904	47905	47905	Dion	33	“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever yanked something out of her hand so quickly . She probably thinks I ’m some sort of weird cliché person now . ”
48104	48110	48111	48111	he	33	“ Is she still there ? ”
48114	48123	48111	48111	he	33	“ No . I ’m in bed now . ”
48135	48141	48128	48128	I	0	“ I … I mean … ”

48185	48204	48177	48177	I	0	“ You really are counting down ? I thought you did n’t want to marry me , either . ”
48212	48217	48218	48218	he	33	“ I did n’t , ”
48221	48232	48218	48218	he	33	“ But I ’m glad it ’s you , Faye . ”
48334	48373	48379	48379	I	0	“ I ’m actually calling to let you know that I ’ll be away for a couple of weeks . I need to finalize my company ’s move . I should be back two weeks before the wedding . ”

48495	48535	48536	48536	I	0	“ Of course , Faye . You can ask me anything , anytime . I know I was n’t always the most attentive , but that ’ll change now . You ’re entitled to me . All of me . ”

48594	48628	48591	48591	he	33	“ She let me study and work overseas so long as I promised to move back home when I got married . My time is up , so I ’m honoring my promise . ”

48708	48711	48712	48712	he	33	“ Yeah , ”
48716	48774	48712	48712	he	33	“ I ’ll miss it , but we ’ll probably have to go back every few months , anyway . I handle all of our foreign assets , so I ’m always either in the UK , Australia , or Canada . Every once in a while we ’ll travel to Asia , but not as often . ”
48775	48782	48783	48783	I	0	“ I would go with you ? ”
48830	48836	48837	48837	he	33	“ I would hope so , ”

48895	48898	48899	48899	he	33	“ Yeah , ”
48903	48932	48899	48899	he	33	“ I ’ll be okay , sweetheart . It ’ll be nice to have you with me , though . Something to look forward to , I suppose . ”
48982	48997	48998	48998	My	0	“ That does mean you ’ll have to finish the house yourself , baby . ”
49007	49016	49017	49017	He	33	“ I can ? Would that be okay ? ”
49027	49137	49017	49017	He	33	“ Of course , Faye . I ca n’t wait to see what you do with our home . When we initially discussed it , we seemed to be on the same page in terms of decor , so it should be fine . I left a list of all our contractors with my grandmother . They know you ’ll be contacting them , so do n’t hesitate to ask for anything you want . There ’s an interior design company we often use if you prefer it , but you really seemed to like the thought of decorating , so I thought I ’d leave it to you . ”
49138	49142	49143	49143	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
49148	49178	49179	49179	He	836	“ For trusting me with this . You have no idea how much this means to me , Dion . I wo n’t let you down , I promise . ”
49182	49189	49190	49190	he	836	“ You ’re so fucking adorable , ”
49193	49219	49190	49190	he	836	“ Forty - eight days … at least I ’ll be working through most of it , so maybe that ’ll help pass the time . ”
49310	49356	49305	49305	I	0	“ I have to go . I ’ll try to call you every once in a while , alright ? If you need anything at all , just text me . The time difference is a little inconvenient , but I ’ll make it work . ”
49357	49360	49361	49361	I	0	“ Okay , ”
49364	49372	49361	49361	I	0	“ Have a safe flight , Dion . ”
49450	49461	49462	49462	He	33	“ Night , Faye . I ’ll see you soon . ”
50078	50081	50082	50082	I	0	“ Beautiful . ”
50138	50145	50146	50146	I	0	“ I … I ’m sorry , ”
50195	50225	50226	50226	I	0	“ I … I did n’t mean to touch your piano . I just … I … It ’s just so stunning , and I could n’t resist her , ”
50297	50303	50304	50304	he	33	“ I know the feeling , ”
50326	50336	50337	50337	he	33	“ Everything that ’s mine is yours , Faye , ”
50346	50349	50337	50337	he	33	“ Everything . ”
50393	50398	50399	50399	he	33	“ Play it again , ”
50409	50416	50399	50399	he	33	“ For me , this time . ”
50432	50437	50422	50422	his	33	“ Please , Faye . ”
50659	50663	50664	50664	he	33	“ Sixteen days , ”
50711	50739	50703	50703	I	0	“ Soon , I ’m going to make you play the hardest piece you know , while I kneel between your pretty legs and taste your pussy . ”
50764	50800	50758	50758	his	33	“ Soon , you ’ll think of me every time you play , and each time I hear the sound of a piano , I ’ll think of you . My beautiful , delicious wife . ”
50884	50928	50881	50881	he	33	“ I ’ve thought of you every single day while I was away . When I close my eyes , I can just about imagine the way you taste … but I need a reminder , Faye . Wo n’t you remind me ? ”
51069	51072	51073	51073	he	33	“ Faye , ”
51076	51099	51100	51100	He	33	“ I thought I ’d be able to resist you if I saw you again , but I should ’ve known better . ”
51265	51286	51287	51287	he	33	“ And just like that , you ’ve created a new fantasy , baby . You , seated right here , ”
51304	51316	51294	51294	His	33	“ And that pretty mouth of yours wrapped around my cock . ”
51366	51371	51372	51372	he	33	“ But for now , ”
51375	51387	51372	51372	he	33	“ I want you to show me around our new home . ”
51400	51410	51411	51411	He	33	“ I love what I ’m seeing so far . ”
51460	51470	51471	51471	I	0	“ We do n’t have to do it now , ”
51475	51504	51471	51471	I	0	“ You must be so tired . I did n’t mean to intrude . It ’s quite late already , and you probably want to go to bed . ”
51533	51538	51539	51539	he	33	“ What I want , ”
51557	51566	51549	51549	He	33	“ Is for you to show me around . ”
51598	51603	51604	51604	he	33	“ Let ’s go , ”
51661	51669	51670	51670	he	33	“ You did so well , angel , ”
51700	51720	51721	51721	I	0	“ I love everything you ’ve done . I knew you ’d turn this space into a real home . ”
51850	51859	51860	51860	he	33	“ This is my favorite room so far , ”
51863	51871	51860	51860	he	33	“ I ’m glad you like it , ”
51877	51888	51860	51860	he	33	“ I went with dark tones and a modern aesthetic . ”
51941	51948	51949	51949	he	33	“ Start moving your things in , ”
51953	51987	51949	51949	he	33	“ Sixteen days , Faye . That ’s all the time you have left . From the moment we ’re married , I ’m not spending a single night alone in that bed . ”
52281	52285	52286	52288	my makeup artist	874	“ All done , ”
52445	52448	52449	52449	Raven	66	“ Faye , ”
52459	52497	52449	52449	Raven	66	“ I ’m really sorry to do this to you on such an important day , but there was a major issue with your wedding dress , so I ’ve had to bring you a different one . ”
52511	52528	52529	52529	she	40	“ That is completely unacceptable . Do you have any idea who my sister is marr — ”
52559	52568	52569	52569	she	40	“ I do n’t think we ’ve met , ”
52578	52584	52569	52569	she	40	“ I ’m Raven Windsor . ”
52664	52668	52669	52669	Sierra	37	“ Sierra Windsor , ”
52676	52721	52669	52669	Sierra	37	“ And as far as I ’m aware , this room was reserved solely for Faye . I ’m going to have to insist that you give us a moment with her . The Windsor security team will show you to a different room . ”
52734	52742	52743	52743	she	48	“ Sierra really does hate repeating herself , ”
52746	52754	52743	52743	she	48	“ So I wo n’t make her . ”
52785	52794	52795	52795	I	0	“ Would it be okay if they stay ? ”
52833	52851	52852	52852	I	0	“ There ’s plenty of space , and I ’d hate getting ready all alone . Please , ”
52873	52880	52881	52884	one of the bodyguards	889	“ We ’ll guard the door , ”
52906	52909	52910	52910	Sierra	37	“ Whew , ”
52927	52938	52920	52920	She	37	“ I did n’t think they ’d leave so easily . ”
53000	53023	52995	52995	she	37	“ I ’m sorry about that , but privacy is very important to us . You ’ll come to appreciate it soon . ”
53034	53040	53041	53041	she	37	“ So about your dress , ”
53104	53133	53075	53075	she	48	“ There was a problem with the dress you were meant to wear , so I altered this dress for you instead . I hope that ’s okay ? ”
53134	53137	53138	53138	I	0	“ Yes , ”
53178	53193	53194	53194	Sierra	37	“ It ’s an honor to be wearing any of your gowns at all . ”
53205	53222	53223	53223	she	37	“ If it ’s okay with you , we ’d love to help you get dressed , ”
53236	53284	53285	53285	She	37	“ I wanted to reach out after Hawaii since we did n’t really get to spend much time together then , but Dion told us to stay away from you until the wedding . For some strange reason , he was convinced we ’d scare you away . ”
53292	53295	53296	53296	she	37	“ Us ! ”
53299	53308	53296	53296	she	37	“ As if we are n’t total delights ! ”
53400	53414	53390	53390	Sierra	37	“ Which reminds me , Dion asked me to give this to you . ”
53669	53672	53673	53673	Raven	48	“ Ready ? ”
53822	53825	53826	53826	I	0	“ Yes , ”
53829	53834	53826	53826	I	0	“ I ’m ready . ”
53941	53948	53949	53949	she	48	“ You look beautiful , Faye , ”
53970	53979	53949	53949	she	48	“ This dress truly was made for you . ”
54000	54041	53985	53985	her	48	“ You might be marrying Dion today , Faye , but you ’re gaining an entire new family , too . Being a Windsor can be overwhelming at times , but you ’ll never be alone . Not ever again . ”
54141	54147	54148	54148	Sierra	37	“ That ’s our cue , ”
54181	54188	54189	54189	he	148	“ That dress is a disgrace , ”
54192	54265	54189	54189	he	148	“ It ’s far too simple for a Windsor bride . You ’re not even married yet and they ’re already mocking you . There ’s no way someone like Raven Windsor messed up your dress days before the wedding , when there was nothing wrong at your last fitting . They ’re trying to embarrass us , and we ca n’t do anything about it but take it with a smile . ”
54266	54274	54275	54275	He	148	“ I … I do n’t think — ”
54295	54390	54391	54391	He	908	“ Do n’t think you ’ll get to rest easy from now on , and do n’t think for a moment those two have your best interests at heart . You need to work hard to win Dion over . Without his support , they ’ll trample all over us . You should have kicked up a fuss when they asked Abigail and the girls to leave . What is wrong with you , you spineless piece of shit ? How could you have stood there and watch your family be embarrassed like that ? ”
54404	54434	54391	54391	He	908	“ Try to get through the wedding without embarrassing me any further , or so help me god , I ’ll make Chloe and Linda pay for your mistakes . ”
54583	54587	54588	54588	I	0	“ You okay ? ”
54649	54654	54655	54655	Faye	33	“ I ’m fine , ”
54789	54797	54798	54798	My	0	“ I meant it . The note . ”
54834	54838	54839	54839	I	0	“ Zero days , ”

54913	54916	54908	54908	she	909	“ Faye . ”
54970	54973	54974	54974	she	909	“ Eric , ”
55037	55043	55044	55044	I	0	“ Why are you here ? ”
55047	55057	55044	55044	I	0	“ Your father was invited . You were not . ”
55095	55111	55112	55112	He	44	“ I ’m here on my father ’s behalf . He could n’t make it . ”
55130	55141	55121	55121	he	44	“ Besides , I had to see this for myself . ”
55142	55145	55150	55150	her	333	“ Eric , ”
55164	55169	55170	55170	He	44	“ I ’m sorry . ”
55193	55202	55172	55172	his	44	“ Do n’t be , my little fairy . ”
55265	55271	55272	55272	I	0	“ She ’s my wife , ”
55282	55290	55272	55272	I	0	“ You ’ll call her Mrs. Windsor . ”
55291	55295	55296	55296	he	44	“ For now , ”
55307	55315	55296	55296	he	44	“ She ’s your wife for now . ”
55325	55380	55316	55316	I	0	“ What the fuck is that supposed to mean , Eric ? You know better than to covet what ’s mine . I ’ve been as courteous as I can be given the circumstances , but that ends now . Do not mistake my kindness for weakness — you ca n’t bear the consequences . ”
55397	55410	55411	55411	he	44	“ My father ’s firm has represented the Windsor family for years , ”
55419	55427	55411	55411	he	44	“ I ’ve seen the marriage contract . ”
55438	55442	55443	55443	he	44	“ Three years , ”
55446	55460	55443	55443	he	44	“ I can wait , Faye . For you , I ’ll wait . ”
55588	55603	55604	55604	I	0	“ Do you really think she ’ll want you after she ’s had me ? ”
55611	55632	55604	55604	I	0	“ By the end of the night , she wo n’t even remember her own name , let alone yours . ”
55658	55666	55667	55667	She	931	“ Is n’t that right , wife ? ”
55681	55684	55685	55685	she	931	“ Dion , ”

55967	55972	55973	55973	I	0	“ I warned you , ”
55976	56009	55973	55973	I	0	“ I told you that you had until today to get over him , so why the fuck did I still find you looking at him like you wish I were him ? ”

56100	56128	56129	56129	I	0	“ You … you told me you ’d f - fuck every memory of him out of me , until you ’re all I can think about . ”

56235	56239	56240	56240	I	0	“ And then ? ”
56266	56279	56280	56280	I	0	“ What did I tell you I ’d make you do next ? ”
56314	56325	56326	56326	I	0	“ You said you ’d make me beg for more . ”

56395	56459	56385	56385	I	0	“ I meant it when I said I would n’t take you against your will , Faye . Say it , and I ’ll step away right now . I ’ll take my anger out on my cock in the shower , and I ’ll leave you be . I wo n’t touch a single strand of your hair . Do you understand ? ”
56525	56555	56512	56512	I	0	“ I need to hear you say that you understand , Faye . I need to know that you ’re aware you can withdraw your consent at any point . ”

58631	58636	58637	58637	I	0	“ That ’s two , ”
58713	58728	58729	58729	I	0	“ You act like this is the first time you ’re seeing my abs , ”
58732	58747	58729	58729	I	0	“ Like you did n’t massage champagne into them just a few months ago . ”

58778	58790	58771	58771	I	0	“ Make my fantasies come true , Faye . Undress me . ”

59276	59303	59273	59273	he	33	“ You look fucking beautiful in that dress , my love , but I do n’t want anything between us the first time I fuck you . ”

59497	59556	59557	59557	I	0	“ I do n’t want to miss a second of this , baby . I want to enjoy every inch of your body and witness every expression you make . The first time I take you wo n’t be in the dark , Faye . You came for me twice tonight , but now you ’re getting shy ? ”
59683	59687	59688	59688	he	33	“ Fucking hell , ”
59698	59709	59688	59688	he	33	“ Is any part of you anything short of perfect ? ”

61553	61558	61559	61559	he	33	“ Fuck , Faye , ”
61605	61608	61609	61609	he	33	“ Perfect , ”

62123	62151	62120	62120	I	0	“ In fact , I think I should give all of them to you . They look far better on you than they ever did on me . ”
62219	62225	62226	62226	I	0	“ Forgive me , Faye , ”
62233	62239	62226	62226	I	0	“ I did n’t know . ”

62270	62273	62274	62274	I	0	“ Mad ? ”
62279	62322	62274	62274	I	0	“ Why would I be mad , baby ? If I ’m mad at all , it ’s only at myself . I never wanted to hurt you , angel . If I ’d known , I ’d have been more careful . ”
62335	62394	62323	62323	She	958	“ Perhaps mad is n’t the right word . Are you disappointed , Dion ? I know I ’m not … I ’m nothing like the women you ’re usually photographed with . I have no … experience . The things you did to me … I do n’t know how to make you feel the same way . ”
62395	62398	62399	62399	I	0	“ Faye , ”
62402	62408	62399	62399	I	0	“ Please look at me . ”
62438	62515	62428	62428	I	0	“ There ’s no real way for me to say this in a polite manner , but I have never come harder than I did last night , buried deep inside you . That was the single best sexual experience I ’ve ever had . If that ’s what you do to me with no experience , I ’ll be well and truly fucked once we get to know each other ’s bodies better , hmm ? ”
62575	62581	62582	62582	I	0	“ How do you feel ? ”
62589	62598	62582	62582	I	0	“ Does it … does it still hurt ? ”
62611	62620	62621	62621	she	958	“ It ’s all just a little sensitive , ”
62702	62707	62708	62708	I	0	“ At The Lacara , ”
62715	62726	62708	62708	I	0	“ You ’d been planning to give him your virginity ? ”
62775	62779	62780	62780	I	0	“ I see , ”
62790	62793	62794	62794	she	958	“ Dion , ”
62801	62804	62794	62794	she	958	“ I … ”
62891	62898	62899	62899	she	958	“ I do n’t regret it , ”
62902	62910	62899	62899	she	958	“ I ’m glad it was you . ”
62923	62927	62928	62928	I	0	“ Me too , ”

63098	63126	63082	63082	I	0	“ I gave you one chance and you blew it . I will never again show you the leniency I showed you then . Do you understand ? ”
63134	63144	63145	63145	I	0	“ I ’ll be good to you , baby , ”
63149	63184	63145	63145	I	0	“ I ’ll be the best husband you could ever ask for — so long as you remain a good girl for me . Fuck with me again , and I ’ll punish you . ”
63185	63190	63191	63191	she	958	“ H - how ? ”
63198	63214	63191	63191	she	958	“ How would you punish me ? Would it be like … like last night ? ”
63312	63344	63345	63345	I	0	“ If I find out you ’ve so much as dreamed bout him , I ’ll force you to your knees and make him watch as you choke on my cock , ”
63454	63473	63474	63474	I	0	“ I do n’t want to punish you , beautiful , but I will if I have to . ”
63523	63646	63647	63647	She	980	“ If you do more than dream of him , I ’ll tie you to our bed and canvas every inch of your body , leaving a kiss mark on your skin for every single word you spoke to him . I ’ll mark you for the whole world to see , Faye . I ’ll turn you on beyond reason only to leave you desperate . I wo n’t let you come , my darling wife . I ’ll keep you right at the edge until you remember who you belong to , until you ’re begging me for forgiveness . You do n’t want that , do you ? You want to be good for me , do n’t you ? ”
63778	63785	63786	63786	I	0	“ You ’re sore , angel , ”
63789	63808	63786	63786	I	0	“ Let me draw you a nice warm bath , hmm ? It ’ll make you feel better . ”
63823	63830	63815	63815	she	980	“ I wo n’t touch you , ”
63835	63851	63831	63831	I	0	“ I will never hurt you , Faye . Not unless you want me to . ”
63933	63936	63937	63937	I	0	“ Grandmother , ”
63948	63962	63937	63937	I	0	“ To what do I owe this pleasure so soon after the wedding ? ”
64008	64020	64021	64021	she	112	“ Does it still sound as beautiful as it used to ? ”
64204	64217	64218	64218	I	0	“ I do n’t appreciate you involving my wife in your schemes , ”
64221	64233	64218	64218	I	0	“ I refuse to play along like Ares and Luca did . ”
64244	64253	64236	64236	her	112	“ You married her , did n’t you ? ”
64263	64285	64254	64254	I	0	“ You left me no choice — but your involvement ends here . I wo n’t have you manipulate my wife . ”
64304	64308	64309	64309	she	112	“ Your wife , ”
64312	64336	64309	64309	she	112	“ You ’re awfully protective of a woman you wanted nothing to do with for years . It seems I worried for nothing . ”
64395	64399	64390	64390	she	112	“ Grandma Anne ? ”
64496	64501	64502	64502	Grandma	34	“ Faye , sweetheart , ”
64531	64558	64559	64559	I	0	“ The house looks beautiful . I ca n’t believe you decorated it all by yourself . That ’s some talent you have there , honey . ”
64688	64711	64712	64712	Grandma	34	“ I ’m here today to discuss some of your new responsibilities and the rules you ’ll both have to adhere to , ”
64765	64792	64793	64793	Grandma	34	“ Later today , I ’ll send over Lauren , your housekeeper , and Garret , your chauffeur . They ’re both excited to meet you , ”
64975	65001	65002	65002	Faye	33	“ Considering how long the two of you were engaged , I take it you do n’t need me to remind you of the rules ? ”
65007	65042	65043	65043	she	333	“ A minimum of three years of a faithful marriage that we ’re both giving our best shot , no more than three consecutive days apart throughout that time , and sharing a bedroom , ”
65055	65095	65043	65043	she	333	“ In that case , all that remains is for me to hand over some of the charities and foundations I ’ve been running , starting with the one that ’s dearest to me — The Windsor Staccato Foundation . ”
65138	65155	65156	65156	she	34	“ It ’s the foundation that my daughter - in - law founded with your mother , ”
65159	65233	65156	65156	she	34	“ Dion keeps it funded , but there is far more that could be done with it . Its aim is to provide free music classes for those who ca n’t afford it , and to nurture talent when we find it . Both of your mothers firmly believed that access to music was a basic right that should never be withheld from any child , and I suspect you feel the same . ”
65313	65321	65322	65322	Faye	33	“ I wo n’t let you down , ”
65335	65342	65329	65329	Grandma	34	“ I know you wo n’t . ”
65426	65432	65433	65433	she	34	“ Oh , and Faye ? ”
65446	65473	65433	65433	she	34	“ Your father called me today . He told me he could n’t reach you and would like to remind you of your concert next week . ”
65520	65537	65538	65538	I	0	“ You do n’t have to work if you do n’t want to , you know ? ”
65541	65583	65538	65538	I	0	“ If you do n’t enjoy the concerts , or if you just need a break , that ’s fine . You ’re a Windsor now , Faye . You do n’t have to do anything you do n’t want to . ”
65620	65629	65630	65630	she	34	“ I ’d be nothing without the piano , ”
65638	65648	65630	65630	she	34	“ Please do n’t take that away from me . ”
65658	65683	65649	65649	I	0	“ I do n’t have the power to take anything away from you , angel . I ’m your husband , not your warden . ”
65728	65734	65735	65735	Dion	33	“ You look beautiful tonight , ”
65756	65770	65748	65748	his	33	“ I ’m sorry I ’ll have to miss your concert , Faye . ”
65837	65842	65843	65843	he	33	“ You ’re nervous , ”
65846	65892	65843	65843	he	33	“ I thought you ’d be used to playing in front of a crowd by now , but I suppose it never gets any easier . Think about what I said , Faye . If you feel like you need a break , take one . ”
66156	66165	66166	66166	I	0	“ Will you be okay during your flight ? ”
66177	66180	66181	66181	he	33	“ Yeah , ”
66184	66216	66181	66181	he	33	“ Do n’t you worry , Faye . I ’ll be fine , I promise . If the deal negotiations proceed as expected , I ’ll be back in two days . ”
66251	66265	66266	66266	he	33	“ It ’ll be odd to fall asleep without you in my arms , ”
66278	66289	66290	66290	he	33	“ I think I ’ll miss this hot little mouth , ”
66391	66401	66402	66402	he	33	“ Be good for me while I ’m away , ”
66482	66485	66486	66486	he	33	“ Go , ”
66489	66498	66486	66486	he	33	“ I ’ll see you in two days . ”
66763	66766	66767	66768	my father	148	“ Faye , ”
66775	66780	66767	66768	my father	148	“ You ’re late . ”
66797	66804	66789	66789	his	148	“ I ’m sorry , Father , ”
66853	66857	66858	66858	he	148	“ Come here , ”
66900	66908	66909	66909	he	148	“ You dare make me wait now ? ”
66920	66946	66912	66912	I	0	“ N - no , Father . I … I had to wait for Dion . H - he insisted we drive t - together . ”
66958	66961	66962	66962	he	148	“ Good , ”
66993	67090	67091	67091	I	0	“ I suppose that ’s something , but it does n’t explain why he ’s leaving you all alone after barely a week of marriage . Why is he going on a weekend away with his secretary , Faye ? You could n’t even keep him invested for a week ? Surely having a young , innocent wife should be thrilling for him ? It should ’ve been enough to divert his attention away from Maria , but I should n’t be surprised that you are n’t even good at keeping your legs spread . Pathetic . ”
67167	67171	67172	67172	he	148	“ Try harder , ”
67175	67247	67172	67172	he	148	“ You need to get pregnant . Once you two have a child , he ’ll never be able to leave you . Seduce him , play every trick in the book . Do whatever you must , but you ’d better get pregnant as soon as you can . If you do n’t , he ’ll throw you out in three years and we ’ll lose access to the Windsors . ”
67616	67619	67620	67620	I	0	“ Stop , ”
67627	67635	67620	67620	I	0	“ You ’re hurting yourself , Faye . ”
67661	67666	67667	67667	she	1031	“ I ca n’t , ”
67675	67712	67667	67667	she	1031	“ I ca n’t stop . Please do n’t make me stop , Dion . I need this . I need … I need to feel alive . This is … it ’s all I have . ”
67774	67777	67778	67778	I	0	“ No , ”
67804	67825	67826	67826	She	1031	“ That ’s not all you have , Faye . You ’ve got me . Tell me what you need . ”
67961	67970	67971	67971	she	1031	“ I need … I need to forget , ”
68050	68061	68062	68062	I	0	“ Let me show you a different kind of escape , ”
68139	68144	68145	68145	I	0	“ Missed this pussy , ”
68354	68357	68358	68358	she	1031	“ Dion , ”
68361	68364	68358	68358	she	1031	“ Yes . ”
68824	68827	68828	68828	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
68868	68872	68873	68873	I	0	“ Ride me , ”
68876	68893	68873	68873	I	0	“ Take what you need from me , Faye . I ’m yours for the taking . ”
69021	69026	69027	69027	he	45	“ Something is wrong , ”
69044	69050	69051	69051	I	0	“ What happened , Dion ? ”
69060	69063	69064	69064	I	0	“ Careful , ”
69067	69082	69064	69064	I	0	“ You sound so concerned that I might start to believe we ’re friends . ”
69086	69090	69091	69091	he	45	“ We are , ”
69095	69106	69091	69091	he	45	“ Tell me what happened so we can fix it . ”
69107	69113	69114	69114	I	0	“ I ’m not sure , ”
69117	69122	69114	69114	I	0	“ It ’s Faye . ”
69128	69152	69153	69153	he	45	“ Had it been any of your brothers , I ’d have worried you were calling with some kind of dumb unreasonable request , ”
69160	69220	69156	69156	his	45	“ Ares called me with a weird request once , you know ? It was long before he knew he ’d be marrying Raven . He asked me to put bodyguards on her secretly because he ’d been so worried about her safety . He was too stupid to realize his concern far outweighed what is acceptable between friends . ”
69241	69292	69237	69237	Ares	47	“ And Luca once called to ask me which restaurant Valentina was going to on a date , only to buy the entire place and crash the date . This was after he tried to enforce a company - wide dating ban to stop it from happening , mind you . ”
69342	69432	69317	69317	he	1044	“ Every fiber of my being is telling me something is wrong with her , but I do n’t know what it is . She seemed fine after the wedding . Things were better than I ’d even dared hope for , until I went on a trip to Canada for the weekend . I came home to find her … in a precarious mental state . She seemed more broken than ever before , more so than she had been in the months leading up to our wedding . ”
69433	69446	69447	69447	I	0	“ Were there any signs that something was wrong before you left ? ”
69450	69473	69447	69447	I	0	“ Yes . She seemed reluctant to perform that weekend , but I had n’t given it much thought and left anyway . ”
69508	69526	69527	69527	he	44	“ Your grandmother requested invisible but impenetrable protection for her from the very second you were married , ”
69531	69606	69527	69527	he	44	“ She ’s been more restless about Faye than she has been about Raven or Val , so I oversaw your wife personally while you were away . There were only three people she came into contact with in that time : your driver , your housekeeper , and her father . She did n’t linger after her performance . Faye went straight home and did n’t leave the house until you came back . ”
69612	69624	69625	69625	I	0	“ She denied anything was wrong , but something triggered her , ”
69748	69797	69812	69812	his	1052	“ I want you to watch her closely . If she steps foot outside of our house , I want eyes on her . I ’m not sure what kind of threat I ’m looking for , but I can feel it , Silas . Something is wrong . ”
69798	69808	69809	69809	he	1052	“ We ’ll get to the bottom of this , ”
69818	69849	69809	69809	he	1052	“ In the meantime , you should work on earning her trust . She ’s your wife , Dion . You should n’t have to spy on her like this . ”
69850	69854	69855	69855	I	0	“ I know , ”
70025	70028	70029	70029	she	62	“ Dion ? ”
70095	70108	70109	70109	she	62	“ This office is so different from your smaller one in London , ”
70112	70125	70109	70109	she	62	“ I ’m not sure I ’ll ever get used to this . ”
70126	70129	70130	70130	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
70133	70137	70130	70130	I	0	“ Me too . ”
70212	70275	70194	70194	Maria	62	“ Maria , you know you did n’t have to come with me , right ? I know I ’m asking a lot of you , and all of your friends and family live in London . I ’d understand if you wanted to stay there . Just say the word , and I ’ll write you a glowing letter of recommendation . ”
70292	70297	70298	70298	she	62	“ You never asked , ”
70307	70322	70298	70298	she	62	“ I offered to come with you , but I wish you ’d asked . ”
70372	70377	70378	70378	I	0	“ I ’m grateful , ”
70382	70389	70378	70378	I	0	“ I hope you know that . ”
70410	70426	70427	70427	I	0	“ Of course . You would n’t last a day without me , you know ? ”
70451	70480	70481	70481	She	62	“ I wo n’t hold it against you if you change your mind , Maria . If you want to move back , I ’ll fully support you . ”
70487	70490	70491	70491	she	62	“ No , ”
70498	70552	70491	70491	she	62	“ I want to be by your side . There ’s so much left to do with the relocation and our existing contracts , and it ’ll be tough on you . You ca n’t do everything alone , Dion . It ’s okay to rely on people every once in a while . ”
70556	70563	70553	70553	I	0	“ I do rely on you . ”
70564	70574	70575	70575	she	62	“ Not as much as I want you to , ”
70594	70610	70611	70611	she	62	“ I actually came in to bring you the budgets for the Windsor Staccato Foundation , ”
70630	70640	70627	70627	I	0	“ Should n’t this have been given to Faye ? ”
70650	70686	70641	70641	Maria	62	“ The foundation has always been important to you , so I figured you ’d want the final say . You never even wanted your grandmother to interfere with it more than she needed to . ”
70764	70767	70768	70768	I	0	“ Dion ? ”
70776	70812	70768	70768	I	0	“ You always said your marriage was just a familial obligation , and that you could n’t care less who you married . For years , you acted that way too . Did something change ? ”
70858	70864	70865	70865	She	62	“ Why do you ask ? ”
70878	70884	70885	70885	she	62	“ I was just curious , ”
70888	70956	70885	70885	she	62	“ I want you to be happy . Being forced into a marriage with someone you do n’t really know , someone who is far too young to truly be your equal , it just seems … I ’m just worried you ’ll end up settling for less than you deserve . Making the best of a bad situation is n’t the same as pursuing true happiness . ”
70961	70970	70971	70971	I	0	“ I would never cheat on my wife , ”
70979	70998	70971	70971	I	0	“ So my only choice is to make the best of it and give my marriage a chance . ”
70999	71003	71004	71004	Maria	62	“ For now , ”
71011	71044	71007	71007	her	62	“ In three years , you ’ll have complied with your grandmother ’s terms , and you ’ll be able to divorce her . Then what ? Three years will fly by . ”
71259	71267	71268	71268	she	48	“ I hope I ’m not interrupting , ”
71275	71301	71268	71268	she	48	“ I called earlier , but I could n’t reach you , so I thought I ’d stop by to see if you were home . ”
71302	71307	71308	71308	I	0	“ Not at all , ”
71334	71340	71341	71341	She	48	“ Please , come in . ”
71354	71363	71364	71364	she	48	“ Your home ’s interior is truly stunning , ”
71375	71380	71364	71364	she	48	“ Who designed it ? ”
71400	71406	71407	71407	Raven	48	“ Um , I did . ”
71412	71421	71407	71407	Raven	48	“ You did n’t hire an interior designer ? ”
71427	71444	71422	71422	I	0	“ Dion said I could do it myself if I wanted to , so I did . ”
71445	71448	71449	71449	she	48	“ Wow , ”
71452	71482	71449	71449	she	48	“ Ares and I had our house renovated not too long ago , but it is n’t anywhere near as nice as this . Did you study interior design ? ”
71490	71517	71483	71483	I	0	“ I did look up some basics , but mostly , this was all me . I ’d love to take a course someday , though . ”
71559	71568	71569	71569	she	79	“ Your grandmother sent these over for Faye , ”
71572	71584	71569	71569	she	79	“ I have successfully kept that tidbit of information from Sierra . ”
71629	71634	71635	71635	she	1069	“ I ’m sorry , ”
71643	71710	71635	71635	she	1069	“ The cookies … it ’s a thing . Sierra and I have been fighting over these cookies for years , so now when I see them , I instinctively just grab them . I ’ve gotten used to having to be quicker than she is . You ’ll find out soon enough . Once Sierra learns you ’ve got cookies , she ’ll come knocking . ”
71725	71733	71734	71734	I	0	“ You can have all of them , ”
71767	71799	71758	71758	She	1069	“ I ’m going to send Sierra a picture . I know she ’s stuck in a meeting right now , so she ’ll be fuming . It ’ll be fun . ”
71872	71875	71876	71876	Raven	48	“ Here , ”
71887	71896	71876	71876	Raven	48	“ This is what I actually came for . ”
71918	71926	71927	71927	she	48	“ I ’m the official Windsor stylist , ”
71940	72016	71927	71927	she	48	“ As you ’ll soon learn , we try to keep most things in the family rather than relying on anyone else , so I dress all of us . I ’m here to find out what you like . I ’ve got a pretty good idea based on the last few times I saw you , but I wanted to check in anyway and make sure you chose a few of your favorite pieces . ”
72022	72033	71927	71927	she	48	“ You mean you wo n’t just choose for me ? ”
72039	72048	72049	72049	she	48	“ Is that what your previous stylist did ? ”
72058	72070	72049	72049	she	48	“ Did they pick your clothes without any input from you ? ”
72105	72117	72118	72118	she	48	“ How do you feel about a casual style like that ? ”
72135	72145	72118	72118	she	48	“ I can wear jeans if I want to ? ”
72173	72179	72180	72180	she	48	“ You ’re a Windsor , ”
72189	72231	72180	72180	she	48	“ You can wear whatever you want , Faye . You could leave the house in a garbage bag with a hole cut out for your head , and The Herald will praise you for setting a new affordable fashion standard . ”
72238	72266	72234	72234	her	48	“ Or they ’ll tear you apart for some kind of fabricated reason that ’ll increase their advertising revenue and clicks . They ’re good at that . ”
72304	72313	72314	72314	I	0	“ I never got to thank you properly , ”
72321	72327	72314	72314	I	0	“ For my wedding dress . ”
72334	72371	72328	72328	She	48	“ It was my pleasure . You looked truly radiant , and Dion could n’t take his eyes off you . The way he carried you out of the reception hall was the stuff of fairytales . ”
72423	72429	72430	72430	I	0	“ How did you know ? ”
72472	72500	72457	72457	She	48	“ One day I had to review the boutique ’s security footage because I ’d lost my bracelet , and I saw you staring at that dress . ”
72513	72559	72507	72507	she	48	“ Something about the way you looked did n’t sit well with me , so I reviewed the security footage of all your visits . Each time , you stared at that dress in awe , but you never even asked to try it on . ”
72580	72583	72584	72584	she	48	“ Faye , ”
72591	72665	72584	72584	she	48	“ My security system is very comprehensive , and it includes sound . I was n’t comfortable with how dismissive your stepmother and half - sisters were of you , or the way they spoke of you when you were n’t in the room . It reminded me a little of the way my mother and sister always treated me . It ’s why I asked them to leave on your wedding day . ”
72830	72840	72812	72812	she	48	“ Accosting my wife , are you , Rave ? ”
73000	73006	73007	73007	I	0	“ You ’re home early , ”
73040	73068	73033	73033	He	33	“ Something came up at work , so I have to go back to London for a few days . I thought maybe we could go together . ”
73095	73101	73102	73102	I	0	“ I ’ve never been , ”
73106	73114	73102	73102	I	0	“ I ’d love to join you . ”
73205	73208	73209	73209	I	0	“ Faye ? ”
73323	73338	73339	73339	Dion	33	“ I ’ve been trying to get you to smile like that for weeks , ”
73368	73394	73339	73339	Dion	33	“ If I ’d known taking you on a trip would do it , I ’d have carried you onto a plane every single day . ”
73408	73416	73417	73417	I	0	“ Do n’t even joke about it , ”
73420	73431	73417	73417	I	0	“ I ’d hate to see you suffering every day . ”
73441	73449	73432	73432	His	33	“ You care about me , huh ? ”
73455	73466	73450	73450	I	0	“ Of course , Dion . You ’re my husband . ”
73482	73495	73496	73496	he	33	“ That ’s the first time you ’ve called me your husband , ”
73527	73542	73543	73543	he	33	“ You act like my wife in bed , but not outside of it , ”
73551	73568	73543	73543	he	33	“ Our conversations are still overly polite and distant . You wo n’t let me in . ”
73574	73581	73543	73543	he	33	“ I … I did n’t … ”
73753	73757	73758	73758	he	33	“ Come on , ”
73761	73772	73758	73758	he	33	“ We do n’t have much time left before takeoff . ”
73823	73837	73838	73838	I	0	“ This plane is much bigger than the last one we were on , ”
73841	73851	73838	73838	I	0	“ So hopefully it ’ll be a smoother flight . ”
73894	73897	73898	73898	she	62	“ Faye , ”
73919	73945	73912	73912	she	62	“ I did n’t realize you ’d be here . Let me check if all the paperwork is in order for you to join us . ”
73996	74004	74005	74005	Dion	33	“ Where do you want to sit ? ”
74021	74030	74031	74031	I	0	“ Which seat would make you most comfortable ? ”
74048	74053	74054	74054	he	33	“ How about here ? ”
74057	74068	74054	74054	he	33	“ I like being able to stretch out my legs . ”
74100	74122	74123	74123	he	33	“ This plane was built for my siblings and me , and we ’re all much , much taller than you , ”
74222	74235	74236	74236	I	0	“ Why are you always on your knees in front of me ? ”
74273	74286	74287	74287	he	33	“ I ’d love to be on my knees behind you too , ”
74290	74300	74287	74287	he	33	“ I have n’t taken you from behind yet . ”
74316	74320	74321	74321	he	33	“ Fucking adorable , ”
74335	74392	74393	74393	He	33	“ It ’s because you ’re so fucking small . When I stand in front of you , I have to bend down too far to kiss you . I like being at eye - level — besides , when you ’re sitting and I ’m on my knees , it ’s easy to do this . ”
74454	74467	74468	74468	she	62	“ Did you want to accompany the pilot for his final checks ? ”
74515	74520	74521	74521	he	33	“ It ’s alright , ”
74528	74535	74521	74521	he	33	“ I think I ’m fine . ”
74551	74554	74555	74555	she	62	“ Okay , ”
74558	74568	74555	74555	she	62	“ Then we ’ll be ready for takeoff soon . ”
74596	74605	74606	74606	Maria	62	“ Let ’s go over the client details , ”
74813	74816	74817	74817	I	0	“ Dion , ”
75036	75047	75048	75048	I	0	“ Just a little longer and the plane will steady , ”
75170	75173	75174	75174	he	33	“ Bedroom , ”
75210	75221	75222	75222	he	33	“ I ca n’t be patient with you right now , ”
75246	75255	75256	75256	I	0	“ I do n’t want you to be , ”
75268	75290	75291	75291	He	33	“ I want you to use me , Dion . Let me be your escape . Let me make you forget . ”
75310	75315	75316	75316	he	33	“ Open your mouth , ”
75319	75344	75316	75316	he	33	“ You wo n’t be able to use your safe words , so pinch my waist if you feel uncomfortable and I ’ll stop . ”
75364	75371	75372	75372	he	33	“ Such a good fucking girl , ”
75390	75407	75372	75372	he	33	“ Look at how you ’re taking my cock , baby . Just look at you . ”
75432	75441	75442	75442	I	0	“ Can you take me a little deeper ? ”
75457	75473	75474	75474	He	33	“ Breathe slowly , baby . You can do this . I know you can . ”
75606	75626	75627	75627	I	0	“ Can I move , baby ? I need to fuck your mouth , Faye . I need you . ”
75674	75689	75668	75668	his	33	“ You like that , huh ? You like sucking your husband ’s cock ? ”
75703	75708	75709	75709	he	33	“ My good girl , ”
75712	75735	75709	75709	he	33	“ Your mouth is so perfect , baby . You ’re so good at this , so good at taking my cock . ”
75754	75764	75750	75750	he	33	“ Is your pussy wet for me , Faye ? ”
75778	75791	75792	75792	he	33	“ Slide your hand down your body and push your underwear aside , ”
75813	75822	75823	75823	I	0	“ Push your middle finger in , baby . ”
75871	75877	75878	75878	he	33	“ Give me those fingers , ”
75979	75983	75984	75984	I	0	“ Take me , ”
75987	75993	75984	75984	I	0	“ Fuck me , Dion . ”
76018	76026	76027	76027	he	33	“ There ’s nothing I want more , ”
76075	76080	76081	76081	he	33	“ Look at you , ”
76084	76101	76081	76081	he	33	“ Soaking wet for your husband . Did sucking my cock make you wet , angel ? ”
76112	76123	76106	76106	he	33	“ Of course it did , my perfect little wife . ”
76190	76200	76201	76201	he	33	“ You ’re so good at taking my cock , ”
76211	76218	76201	76201	he	33	“ I need to see you . ”
76236	76239	76240	76240	His	33	“ Fuck . ”
76269	76277	76278	76278	he	33	“ Wrap your legs around me tightly , ”
76329	76335	76309	76309	he	33	“ Like what you see ? ”
76433	76446	76447	76447	he	33	“ Love watching my cock disappear in your tight , hungry pussy , ”
76539	76552	76553	76553	he	33	“ You make the whole world fade away , you know that ? ”
76576	76611	76556	76556	he	33	“ When I ’m inside you , I feel complete . You were never supposed to make me feel this way , Faye . What the fuck have you done to me , hmm ? ”
76612	76615	76616	76616	I	0	“ Dion , ”
76657	76664	76640	76640	his	33	“ I ca n’t take it . ”
76665	76669	76670	76670	he	33	“ You can , ”
76673	76677	76670	76670	he	33	“ You will . ”
76700	76713	76692	76692	he	33	“ Take my cock like the good girl you are , Faye . ”
76750	76757	76758	76758	he	33	“ Look at you , baby , ”
76761	76781	76758	76758	he	33	“ I ’m so proud of you . You ’re so good at taking my cock . So good . ”
76807	76819	76820	76820	he	33	“ You want to come for me , do n’t you ? ”
76826	76829	76830	76830	I	0	“ Please , ”
76833	76839	76830	76830	I	0	“ I ’m so close . ”
76860	76866	76867	76867	I	0	“ Oh God , Dion , ”
76870	76873	76867	76867	I	0	“ Yes ! ”
76874	76903	76853	76853	his	33	“ You sexy little thing . My perfect , perfect wife . Come for me , baby . I need to feel your pussy tighten around my cock . ”
77033	77038	77039	77039	I	0	“ I want to , ”
77049	77064	77039	77039	I	0	“ I want to let you in . I just do n’t know how . ”
77118	77130	77131	77131	Maria	62	“ We could ’ve gotten the price down a little more , ”
77143	77164	77165	77165	She	62	“ And it would ’ve cost me an entire extra day to do that . It was n’t worth it . ”
77201	77217	77218	77218	I	0	“ That one extra day of negotiations could ’ve saved us a few hundred thousand . ”
77221	77228	77229	77229	I	0	“ I do n’t lack money , ”
77341	77348	77349	77349	she	62	“ You ’ve been different lately , ”
77365	77393	77353	77353	I	0	“ Your work is sloppier than usual , and you ’re distracted . I ’m worried about you , Dion . You do n’t seem like yourself . ”
77402	77405	77406	77406	I	0	“ Maria , ”
77409	77438	77406	77406	I	0	“ I ’m sorry you feel the quality of my work has gone down . I ’ll pay more attention and ensure none of our deals are affected . ”
77442	77460	77439	77439	She	62	“ Is it her ? I ’ve never seen you act the way you do around her . ”
77461	77464	77465	77465	I	0	“ Faye ? ”
77481	77512	77473	77473	she	62	“ I suppose in some ways , yes . I ’ve always thrown myself into my work because it was all I had , and that ’s no longer true . ”
77543	77553	77554	77554	I	0	“ I want to make things work with her , ”
77629	77633	77634	77634	Maria	62	“ I see , ”
77660	77671	77672	77672	she	62	“ I just want you to be happy , Dion , ”
77684	77726	77672	77672	she	62	“ I could tell there ’s something between you … on the plane . It was n’t just lust . It was more than that . You sought her for comfort , and she provided it like she truly understood you . ”
77755	77759	77760	77760	I	0	“ About that , ”
77763	77803	77760	77760	I	0	“ It was not my intention to make you feel uncomfortable , but I ’d understand if you no longer wish to fly with my wife and me . I would be happy to make alternative arrangements for you . ”
77813	77892	77810	77810	her	1133	“ It ’s fine , Dion . That was n’t the point I was trying to make . I ’m just worried you ’re mistaking your sense of loyalty and obligation for something else , especially because lust is clearly involved . I ’m worried you ’ll settle for her and you ’ll both spend the rest of your lives wondering what could ’ve been — or worse , you ’ll miss out on what should ’ve been . ”
77897	77935	77893	77893	She	1133	“ But I hope I ’m wrong , because you do seem calmer than you ’ve ever been before . She seems to have a positive effect on you , even if it affects your work negatively . ”
77955	77958	77936	77936	I	0	“ Maria — ”
78014	78017	78018	78018	I	0	“ Faye , ”
78061	78091	78049	78049	I	0	“ Whatever is going on inside that pretty mind of yours , I can assure you it is n’t true . She was just fixing my tie for me . ”
78092	78095	78096	78096	she	1133	“ Why ? ”
78156	78168	78169	78169	She	1133	“ I ’m not sure . I suppose it was crooked . ”
78233	78241	78242	78242	she	1133	“ You do n’t need a tie , ”
78249	78266	78242	78242	she	1133	“ Your workday is over now , anyway . There ’s no need to straighten it . ”
78276	78281	78282	78282	I	0	“ Look at me , ”
78329	78355	78356	78356	Her	1133	“ Tell me you did n’t like her touching me , and it wo n’t ever happen again . Just say the words , Faye . ”
78374	78381	78382	78382	she	1133	“ I do n’t like it , ”
78385	78435	78382	78382	she	1133	“ I really do n’t like it when she ’s so close to you , Dion . I do n’t like that there ’s so much history between you two , and I do n’t like all the rumors surrounding you . I do n’t like any of it . ”
78446	78456	78457	78457	I	0	“ Good girl . Tell me what you want , ”
78461	78480	78457	78457	I	0	“ You told me you wanted to let me in , so start by telling me that much . ”
78535	78549	78550	78550	she	1133	“ I want you to draw better boundaries between the two of you , ”
78566	78591	78550	78550	she	1133	“ I do n’t want her standing so close to you again , and she definitely has no business touching your tie like that . ”
78670	78673	78674	78674	I	0	“ Done , ”
78701	78735	78688	78688	I	0	“ Though I wish you had n’t crumpled and thrown down my tie like that . I bought it because it ’s the same color as your eyes — it ’s my favorite . ”
78743	78746	78747	78747	she	1133	“ Oh ! ”
78778	78794	78795	78795	I	0	“ You can make up for it by letting me take you out for dinner , ”
78951	78962	78963	78963	she	1133	“ It ’s beautiful , but it ’s so empty , ”
78968	78991	78963	78963	she	1133	“ This place is supposed to be famous . I saw it in all the articles about top things to do here . ”
79060	79066	79067	79068	the chef	1149	“ Mr. and Mrs. Windsor , ”
79208	79212	79213	79213	I	0	“ To us , ”
79335	79340	79341	79341	I	0	“ I want more , ”
79361	79366	79358	79358	she	1133	“ More of what ? ”
79367	79370	79371	79371	Her	1133	“ You . ”
79385	79388	79389	79389	she	1133	“ Oh , ”
79392	79402	79389	79389	she	1133	“ I … I ’m not sure what you … ”
79403	79413	79414	79414	I	0	“ Let ’s start with moving beyond small talk , ”
79417	79449	79414	79414	I	0	“ I ’d really like you to stop being so careful around me . It ’s like you ’re only truly honest with me when we ’re in bed , Faye . ”
79484	79536	79537	79537	I	0	“ Now , do n’t get me wrong . I love fucking you , my darling wife . I love making you come on my cock , and fuck , I love the taste of you . But it is n’t enough . I want you outside of bed , too . ”
79588	79613	79614	79614	She	1133	“ Tell me , do you want the same ? Is that what you meant when you said you wanted to let me in ? ”
79630	79633	79634	79634	she	1133	“ Yes , ”
79641	79707	79634	79634	she	1133	“ Then let ’s start by having conversations that are deeper than surface level . Each time I try , you brush me off with an excuse or an answer that sounds awfully well - practiced . I just want you , Faye . You do n’t have to pretend in my presence — the only version of you I want is the real you . ”
79708	79711	79712	79712	she	1133	“ Dion , ”
79719	79733	79712	79712	she	1133	“ What if I do n’t know which version of me is real ? ”
79747	79781	79744	79744	she	1133	“ Then give me all of you , every last jagged fractured piece . Give me all of it , Faye , because those pieces you think are broken ? They complete me . ”
79818	79826	79827	79827	I	0	“ Tell me you want to try , ”
79834	79838	79827	79827	I	0	“ With me . ”
79874	79885	79871	79871	she	1133	“ I do . I want to try with you . ”
80002	80013	80014	80014	I	0	“ Let me start with a simple question , then , ”
80021	80069	80014	80014	I	0	“ How did you start playing the piano ? You ’re one of the youngest concert pianist in the country , and it ’s an impressive feat , but I realize I know nothing about the origins of your career . Was it because of your mother ? ”
80128	80131	80132	80132	she	333	“ Dion , ”
80139	80144	80132	80132	she	333	“ Try , baby , ”
80218	80225	80226	80226	she	333	“ It was because of you , ”
80235	80357	80226	80226	she	333	“ The only reason I ’m a concert pianist is because of you . My father forced me to learn from the moment he found out about our future marriage . I was three . I had to learn because at that time , it still seemed like you would ’ve followed in your mother ’s footsteps . When it became clear that you would n’t , my father had already realized I ’d inherited my mom ’s talent , and he kept me in classes because he felt being a skilled pianist was a trait your family would appreciate . If nothing else , it ’d be something we ’d have in common and could talk about or bond over . ”
80362	80403	80358	80358	She	1162	“ You say you discuss subjects beyond small talk ? Pick any topic . Anything at all . My entire life was crafted to benefit and complement yours , so if you had an interest in it , so did I. ”
80447	80454	80455	80455	she	1162	“ I … I ’m sorry , ”
80458	80466	80455	80455	she	1162	“ I did n’t … that ’s … ”
80681	80687	80688	80688	I	0	“ Where are you going ? ”
80814	80820	80821	80821	she	1162	“ My father ’s house , ”
80896	80903	80874	80874	she	1162	“ I ’ll come with you . ”
80918	80933	80915	80915	her	1162	“ Oh , no . That ’s not necessary . Lauren made you dinner . ”
80973	80980	80981	80981	I	0	“ I ’ll come with you , ”
81152	81161	81162	81162	she	1162	“ H - he is n’t expecting you , ”
81175	81181	81162	81162	she	1162	“ I should ’ve called . ”
81206	81212	81213	81213	I	0	“ I ’m your husband , ”
81217	81229	81213	81213	I	0	“ Surely it does n’t matter if I join for dinner ? ”
81386	81389	81390	81390	he	317	“ Dion , ”
81398	81410	81390	81390	he	317	“ Faye did n’t tell me you ’d be joining us . ”
81451	81486	81440	81440	I	0	“ My wife was n’t aware I ’d be joining until she was ready to leave the house . I apologize for intruding . If you ’d like us to leave , we can . ”
81594	81631	81632	81632	I	0	“ No , of course you ’re welcome . If I ’d known , I ’d have prepared a nicer dinner . This is , after all , the first time Faye has brought you home . ”
81648	81666	81667	81667	he	53	“ Go help your sister and Abigail in the kitchen and inform them we have a guest , ”
81674	81684	81667	81667	he	53	“ I ’d like to talk business with Dion . ”
81697	81723	81724	81724	I	0	“ My wife does n’t lift a finger in our own home — I ’ll be damned if I let her lift one in yours , ”
81810	81820	81821	81821	he	317	“ Perhaps a joint venture would be of interest , ”
81828	81852	81821	81821	he	317	“ I know the Windsors prefer to keep things in the family , so I thought I ’d bring this to you first . ”
81892	81912	81885	81885	my	0	“ Your daughter has n’t spoken a single word since we walked in here . Did you notice that ? ”
81972	81978	81983	81983	his	317	“ Faye is always quiet , ”
81987	81999	81983	81983	his	317	“ She was raised properly and rarely speaks out of turn . ”
82109	82112	82113	82113	Jimmy	53	“ Faye , ”
82138	82143	82134	82134	she	333	“ Yes , Father ? ”
82162	82196	82150	82150	her	333	“ How is your piano practice going ? I understand you were away for several days ? I hope you are n’t neglecting your work . You have a concert in a week . ”
82217	82223	82224	82224	she	333	“ Practice is going well , ”
82228	82239	82224	82224	she	333	“ I am certain the concert will go as expected . ”
82293	82305	82306	82306	I	0	“ Just how much do you make per concert , darling ? ”
82318	82326	82327	82327	she	333	“ Oh , I ’m not sure , ”
82330	82338	82327	82327	she	333	“ It is n’t much , though . ”
82353	82391	82339	82339	She	333	“ You ’re a concert pianist of the highest caliber . Each concert you play should earn you at least a hundred thousand , and you ’ve been playing twice a month ever since we got married . ”
82405	82408	82409	82409	she	333	“ No , ”
82420	82440	82409	82409	she	333	“ It definitely is n’t that much . I ’m really not good enough for an amount like that . ”
82455	82467	82468	82468	He	53	“ I take it you ’re managing my wife ’s money ? ”
82472	82511	82468	82468	He	53	“ I ’ll send you my bank details . You ’ll deposit everything she ’s earned from the moment we got married into that account . I ’ll send over an independent auditor to verify her earnings tomorrow . ”
82512	82521	82527	82527	his	53	“ I ’m sure that ’s not necessary , ”
82534	82540	82522	82522	he	53	“ Is it , Faye ? ”
82554	82576	82547	82547	I	0	“ As you said , my wife rarely speaks out of turn . She was n’t raised to disobey her husband . ”
82607	82632	82604	82604	I	0	“ You ’ll deposit the money before noon tomorrow , or I ’ll pick you up and drive you to The Windsor Bank myself . ”
82768	82771	82772	82772	I	0	“ Faye ? ”
82849	82859	82840	82840	he	33	“ Wo n’t you show me to your room ? ”
82998	83054	83055	83055	My	0	“ I wondered about this the last time I was here , when I picked you up for our trip to Hawaii . How come there are no photos or mementos of any kind in your room ? I ’m surprised you do n’t have a photo of your mother , at the very least . ”
83068	83078	83079	83079	He	1221	“ I … I just like a minimalistic style . ”
83174	83189	83190	83190	he	1221	“ Is that why we have ornate doorknobs and detailed cushions in our house ? ”
83197	83219	83190	83190	he	1221	“ It certainly explains the perfectly matching shades of gold throughout our home , and the beautiful recurring patterns you chose . ”
83260	83361	83362	83362	I	0	“ You said you ’d try , Faye … so try for me , baby . Nothing you could say would ever make me turn away from you , nor will I repay your honesty with lies . I ’ll readily admit it was hard to hear that I unknowingly but profoundly impacted your upbringing , but do n’t you see it does n’t change a thing ? The past is what it is , unchangeable , irreversible . Despite it , here we stand , you and I. I just want to get to know you better , angel . ”
83402	83409	83410	83410	I	0	“ I used to have one , ”
83420	83429	83410	83410	I	0	“ A photo of my mom and me . ”
83430	83433	83434	83434	he	1224	“ Yeah ? ”
83452	83535	83447	83447	he	1224	“ It was taken at an amusement park , and I was wearing a cute , silly strawberry hat . She had me in her arms , and we were both smiling so brightly that just looking at that photo brought me a bittersweet kind of joy . I was grinning up at the camera , but Mom ? She was staring down at me . She had the biggest smile on her face , like I was a miracle to her . ”
83536	83543	83544	83544	he	1224	“ What happened to the photo ? ”
83555	83660	83544	83544	he	1224	“ Abigail did n’t like it . She hated having a photo of my mother in the house , so one day , after she and my father had an argument , he stormed into my room and destroyed the photo . I used to have a necklace that belonged to her too . It was a golden locket that she ’d been wearing in that photo , and he took that as well . It ’s the last thing I had of hers , and I never saw it again . He did n’t want to leave any reminders that would upset Abigail . ”
83673	83687	83688	83688	he	1227	“ What kind of woman would begrudge a child memories of her mother ? ”
83707	83766	83698	83698	I	0	“ I ’m sure there was more to it . Abigail is n’t … she ’s always been good to me . She ’s the only mother I ’ve ever really known , and I never felt like she treated me differently from the girls . If she did , it was more because I was the eldest . ”
83774	83780	83781	83781	he	1227	“ What about your father ? ”
83788	83795	83781	83781	he	1227	“ Was he good to you ? ”
83807	83833	83796	83796	I	0	“ Of course . He ’s strict , as I ’m sure you know , but he ’s always been a good father to me . ”
83885	83890	83891	83891	he	33	“ You ’re nervous , ”
83894	83897	83891	83891	he	33	“ Why ? ”
83910	83932	83933	83933	He	33	“ I just … it ’s the first time I brought you home , and the atmosphere was a bit tense . ”
83961	83974	83953	83953	he	33	“ Were you truly unaware of how much you ’re likely earning ? ”
84446	84449	84450	84450	I	0	“ Faye . ”
84500	84508	84509	84509	I	0	“ Come here , my darling wife . ”
84585	84600	84601	84601	He	33	“ I hate it when you look at me that way , you know ? ”
84628	84688	84689	84689	He	33	“ That ’s how you used to look at me when you were younger , as though merely being in my presence hurt you . It ’s one of the reasons I could n’t bear to be near you . Some days , it ’s still hard to be around you , knowing that your fears are n’t unfounded . ”
84706	84716	84717	84717	he	33	“ You have no idea how selfish I am , ”
84727	84750	84717	84717	he	33	“ I know what you want , and I ’ll never give it to you . I will never let you go . ”
84782	84785	84786	84786	I	0	“ Dion , ”
84793	84802	84786	84786	I	0	“ You have no idea what I want . ”
84803	84806	84807	84807	he	33	“ This , ”
84814	84839	84807	84807	he	33	“ This thing between us , it keeps me hooked , keeps me coming back for more . I ’m enchanted , you know ? ”
84874	84884	84885	84885	I	0	“ You are n’t enchanted , you ’re drunk . ”
84895	84898	84899	84899	he	33	“ Wow , ”
84902	84910	84899	84899	he	33	“ Wow . That ’s my wife . ”
85054	85083	85084	85084	He	33	“ Your wife would like to know why you ’re drunk at four in the afternoon on a Thursday when you were still supposed to be at work . ”
85101	85106	85086	85086	his	33	“ Because of this . ”
85167	85171	85172	85172	Dion	33	“ Worth it , ”
85200	85207	85208	85208	He	33	“ How do you have this ? ”
85217	85241	85212	85212	his	33	“ That day , at the amusement park ? I was there too , baby . My entire family and yours went together . ”
85258	85264	85265	85265	Dion	33	“ It ’s … us . ”
85288	85304	85277	85277	His	33	“ Yeah . Even then , you were absolutely enamored with me , you know ? ”
85314	85345	85305	85305	I	0	“ Dion , in this photo you ’re holding me in your arms , and you ’re looking at me like I ’m the cutest thing you ’ve ever seen . ”
85346	85415	85308	85308	I	0	“ You were . You are . I was twelve there , and you were two . All of my siblings were jealous of me because you would n’t go anywhere near any of them . I was the only one you liked , the only one that was ever allowed to hold you . I ’d forgotten about that , you know ? I was your favorite . ”
85416	85421	85422	85422	I	0	“ You still are , ”
85564	85567	85568	85568	he	1259	“ Yeah ? ”
85580	85595	85596	85596	I	0	“ Show me , Faye . Prove to me I ’m still your favorite . ”
85812	85836	85798	85798	He	1259	“ Do n’t look so peeved , baby . How am I supposed to leave when your eyes are begging me to stay ? ”
85848	85882	85837	85837	I	0	“ Just count your blessings that my mouth has n’t joined in on the begging . We both know you would n’t be able to say no if I asked you to stay . ”
85969	85975	85976	85976	he	1259	“ Shall I just stay ? ”
85979	86007	85976	85976	he	1259	“ Lex really does n’t need another manufacturing plant . And if he does , he should just buy it domestically and keep me out of it . ”
86019	86024	86025	86025	I	0	“ You ca n’t , ”
86101	86117	86118	86118	I	0	“ It ’s only a weekend , anyway . I ’m sure we ’ll survive , ”
86125	86133	86134	86134	he	1259	“ I do n’t think I will , ”
86158	86176	86144	86144	He	1259	“ I hate flying without you , but not as much as I hate sleeping without you . ”
86217	86222	86223	86223	he	1259	“ I need you , ”
86226	86254	86223	86223	he	1259	“ I have to hear you moan my name just one more time . This morning was n’t enough , Faye . Give me just one more . ”
86305	86313	86314	86314	he	33	“ Who the fuck could that be ? ”
86510	86513	86514	86514	Sierra	37	“ Oh , ”
86521	86528	86514	86514	Sierra	37	“ Why are you still here ? ”
86615	86622	86623	86623	Dion	33	“ I should probably head out , ”
86704	86716	86695	86695	he	33	“ Be good for me while I ’m away , okay ? ”
86738	86741	86742	86742	I	0	“ Always , ”
86779	86799	86809	86809	him	33	“ I ’ll see you in two days , angel . Break a leg at your concert , okay ? ”
86839	86846	86847	86847	Sierra	37	“ Did not see that coming , ”
86864	86868	86856	86856	she	37	“ Me neither , ”
86878	86883	86869	86869	Valentina	60	“ Dion is smitten . ”
86887	86899	86884	86884	Raven	48	“ I told you , and you would n’t believe me . ”
86951	86967	86968	86968	Valentina	60	“ I thought you were joking when you told me this house was a masterpiece , ”
87009	87014	87015	87015	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
87031	87034	87035	87035	she	37	“ Faye , ”
87042	87056	87035	87035	she	37	“ Tell me how that piano made its way into your living room . ”
87057	87119	87120	87120	Sierra	37	“ I … well , your grandmother had it delivered when I was decorating the house . She told me it was one of Dion ’s most beloved possessions , so I had it restored for him and put it in the living room . I know it ’s his , but I ’m the only one who really uses it . ”
87133	87140	87141	87141	she	37	“ Dion lets you touch it ? ”
87159	87163	87164	87164	I	0	“ Of course , ”
87169	87175	87176	87176	I	0	“ I ’m a pianist , ”
87183	87197	87198	87198	Sierra	37	“ Has Dion … has he ever said anything to you about it ? ”
87205	87218	87201	87201	her	37	“ About the piano , or even just the sound of it ? ”
87257	87287	87295	87295	her	60	“ He once said something along the lines of how he ’d soon associate the sound of it with me . Why do you ask ? Is something wrong ? ”
87288	87291	87295	87295	her	60	“ Faye , ”
87299	87417	87295	87295	her	60	“ This piano was made for Tara Windsor . While it ’s true she left it to Dion , there ’s a reason he let it fall into disrepair . He ca n’t stand the sound of the piano without thinking of his mother , and this piano specifically … the only times Dion can even bear to look at it is when he ’s drunk . He ’s never been able to let go of his parents , and he ’s never truly grieved them . Instead , he ’s always avoided every mention of them . If he ’s finally allowing parts of them back into his life , then that is a good thing . ”
87499	87509	87510	87510	Raven	48	“ I should ’ve told you about the piano , ”
87515	87530	87510	87510	Raven	48	“ I saw it last time , but I did n’t connect the dots . ”
87542	87580	87581	87581	Sierra	37	“ The fact that it ’s here , that Dion lets you play it without so much as a hint of protest … you have no idea how much that means to all of us , Faye , ”
87584	87612	87581	87581	Sierra	37	“ You might not realize it , but you ’re doing what none of us have been able to do . You ’re helping him move on . ”
87679	87686	87687	87687	I	0	“ Have I been hurting him ? ”
87774	87777	87778	87778	Raven	48	“ No , ”
87781	87788	87789	87789	She	48	“ You ’ve been healing him . ”
87804	87827	87828	87828	Raven	48	“ Dion wo n’t talk about this , but trust me when I say this is a huge leap forward for him . ”
87896	87950	87890	87890	her	37	“ You have no idea what you ’ve done for him , do you ? The man that opened the door today was the brother I thought I ’d lost , and you returned him to me , to us . I owe you everything , and you do n’t even realize it . ”
87964	87985	87986	87986	I	0	“ Whatever you think I ’ve done for him , I can assure you he ’s done more for me , ”
88078	88083	88084	88084	Sierra	37	“ I remember this , ”
88112	88139	88140	88140	She	37	“ I know you think you do n’t owe me anything , but I beg to differ , and I know exactly how to repay you . ”
88163	88182	88155	88155	Sierra	37	“ The three of us know so many embarrassing stories about Dion that you definitely want to hear . ”
88262	88284	88285	88285	she	60	“ I definitely know a few interesting facts about him that I can be convinced to spill after a few shots , ”
88295	88312	88285	88285	she	60	“ They are n’t from his childhood , but I assure you you ’ll enjoy them . ”
88324	88338	88339	88339	she	48	“ For example , do you know what Dion ’s favorite color is ? ”
88414	88422	88411	88411	I	0	“ Of course . It ’s blue . ”
88436	88443	88444	88444	Raven	48	“ So , hear me out , ”
88466	88595	88454	88454	Sierra	37	“ His favorite color right until my wedding day was green . A few days later , he shows up at my studio , telling me he wants a few ties and cufflinks in a very specific kind of blue . He spent an hour rejecting everything I offered him , and let me tell you , Dion does n’t do that . He ’s the most easygoing of all of us , so I was seriously confused . It made no sense at all . In the end , I had to custom mix colors for him and order him bespoke pieces . I spent months trying to figure out what was wrong with him , and in the end , it was Val who noticed it . ”
88615	88624	88625	88625	she	60	“ It ’s so obvious , in hindsight , ”
88641	88654	88655	88655	she	37	“ His new favorite color is the exact shade of your eyes , ”
89416	89419	89420	89420	she	1305	“ Dion ! ”
89518	89528	89529	89529	she	1305	“ I thought … I thought you sent them , ”
89560	89593	89545	89545	her	1305	“ It is n’t what you think , Dion . I promise you , I had no idea they were n’t from you . I did n’t even look for a card . ”
89622	89631	89632	89632	I	0	“ I would never send you red roses , ”
89655	89658	89659	89659	she	1305	“ Dion , ”
89679	89684	89685	89685	I	0	“ I warned you , ”
89695	89753	89685	89685	I	0	“ The day after we got married , I told you exactly what I ’d do to you if I ever found you so much as dreaming of him , yet here you are , smiling into a bouquet he gave you . Did you think I was joking ? Have I been too kind to you ? ”
89754	89764	89765	89765	she	1305	“ The only one I dream of is you , ”
89768	89774	89765	89765	she	1305	“ Only you , Dion . ”
89804	89811	89812	89812	I	0	“ Get on your fucking knees , ”
89855	89863	89851	89851	her	1305	“ Take out my cock , Faye . ”
89922	89945	89946	89946	she	1305	“ You warned me that you ’d fuck my face if I so much of dreamt of him , did n’t you ? ”
89969	89978	89979	89979	I	0	“ Is that what you want , Dion ? ”
90034	90037	90038	90038	I	0	“ Suck , ”
90059	90064	90065	90065	I	0	“ Good fucking girl , ”
90126	90145	90146	90146	I	0	“ Look at the way you ’re taking your husband ’s cock like the good girl you are , ”
90161	90171	90172	90172	She	1305	“ You fucking love this , do n’t you ? ”
90285	90297	90298	90298	I	0	“ You ’re so good at letting me fuck your face , ”
90356	90361	90351	90351	she	1305	“ You fucking tease , ”
90402	90424	90425	90425	She	1305	“ You keep swallowing like that and I ’ll come down your throat , Faye . You ’re playing with fire . ”
90505	90510	90511	90511	I	0	“ Do n’t stop , ”
90616	90629	90630	90630	I	0	“ My wife is too occupied to speak to you , Eric , ”
90783	90789	90790	90790	I	0	“ You ’re so perfect , ”
90813	90849	90799	90799	I	0	“ I ’m so fucking crazy about you , Faye . The way you take my cock without a care for who might be watching , and the way you put me first . I … ”
90876	90882	90883	90883	I	0	“ Get the fuck out , ”
90914	90968	90969	90969	He	44	“ My wife deserves one hell of a reward for her performance , and I do n’t want you here to witness it . I do n’t give a fuck if you want to see my cock , Eric , but you are n’t seeing a single inch of my wife ’s skin . ”
91016	91019	91020	91020	she	333	“ No , ”
91029	91051	91020	91020	she	333	“ I want you to come for me , Dion . Please . I need you to give it to me . ”
91078	91085	91086	91086	I	0	“ Baby , I ca n’t , ”
91090	91104	91086	91086	I	0	“ I ca n’t take it , Faye . I ’m too close . ”
91133	91136	91137	91137	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
91150	91159	91160	91160	I	0	“ I ’m so fucking obsessed with you , ”
91170	91182	91183	91183	She	333	“ You ’re such a good girl , are n’t you ? ”
91198	91205	91192	91192	I	0	“ My perfect , perfect wife . ”
91249	91260	91261	91261	I	0	“ I ’m going to bring those goddamn roses home , ”
91269	91296	91265	91265	my	0	“ tear them up and spread the petals on our bed , and then I ’m going to fuck you until you ’re screaming for mercy . ”
91331	91340	91341	91341	he	33	“ I ’m so fucking sorry , Faye , ”
91354	91358	91344	91344	I	0	“ For what ? ”
91366	91372	91359	91359	I	0	“ For keeping a promise ? ”
91390	91406	91407	91407	He	33	“ For enacting a threat that I never should ’ve made in the first place . ”
91420	91466	91407	91407	He	33	“ I know you love him . I should n’t have … fuck . I do n’t deserve to claim you the way I did . I do n’t even deserve to touch you , yet I still knowingly destroyed every last hope he had . ”
91477	91486	91487	91487	I	0	“ I do n’t love him , Dion , ”
91490	91499	91487	91487	I	0	“ I do n’t think I ever did . ”
91520	91557	91558	91558	He	33	“ Being with him was an act of defiance , a desperate attempt to regain some control in a life I had no say over . It was n’t about love — it was about freedom . ”
91591	91633	91576	91576	I	0	“ If I did n’t want to get on my knees for you , I would n’t have , and you would not have made me . Being able to put your worries to rest like that made me feel incredible . ”
91703	91707	91708	91708	I	0	“ Come on , ”
91716	91734	91708	91708	I	0	“ Let ’s go home . You made me another promise that I expect you to keep . ”
91784	91787	91788	91788	he	33	“ Faye , ”
91839	91842	91843	91843	he	33	“ Stop , ”
91857	91864	91865	91865	I	0	“ I do n’t want to . ”
91884	91934	91876	91876	he	33	“ It took me far too long to realize it , but from the moment we got married , you ’ve been catering to me , showing me this flawless version of you , almost like you ’re trying to make up for the years of neglect and rejection . ”
92062	92075	92076	92076	I	0	“ That ’s not the version of you I want , Dion , ”
92109	92180	92181	92181	He	1349	“ I want the parts of you that you wish would never see the light of day . Dion , I want the man that promised me he ’d fuck me on top of these rose petals . You do n’t need to pretend with me , you know ? I can tell you ’re holding back , and I do n’t want you to . I just want you . ”
92191	92196	92197	92197	he	1349	“ You do n’t , ”
92211	92231	92202	92202	he	1349	“ Baby , if you saw the darkness that hides inside me , you ’d run . Rightfully so . ”
92245	92289	92232	92232	I	0	“ So show me , Dion . Give me what no one else in my life ever has — give me a choice . Show me the worst parts of you and let me decide if I can live with what I find . ”
92301	92332	92297	92297	his	1349	“ Do n’t say I did n’t warn you . I can keep up this act until we ’re gray and old , Faye . For you , I would . ”
92343	92350	92351	92351	I	0	“ I want all of you , ”
92384	92407	92408	92408	His	1349	“ I can take it , Dion . You told me you wanted to try with me , right ? So try . ”
92435	92449	92426	92426	He	1349	“ You want the real me , Faye ? You want the truth ? ”
92463	92624	92625	92625	I	0	“ I ’m fucking furious he was at your concert at all , and though you did good sucking my cock like I told you to , it was n’t enough . I do n’t give a fuck whether or not you were expecting him — the fact that he was there means you have n’t properly put him in his place , and that ’s fucking unacceptable . You are mine . You wear my ring and carry my surname , but you still do n’t realize who the fuck you belong to . I should ’ve broken his fucking fingers to ensure he ’d never lay a hand on you again . Next time , I will . You want the real me , baby ? If he comes near you again , I wo n’t stop until he ’s begging for his fucking life . I ’ll make you watch as he bleeds out at your feet . ”
92699	92702	92703	92703	I	0	“ Understood , ”
92728	92740	92741	92741	he	33	“ I do n’t think you understand at all , sweetheart , ”
92761	92784	92741	92741	he	33	“ But you will , Faye . It ’s about time I make sure you ’ll never forget whose wife you are . ”
92796	92802	92791	92791	he	33	“ Take off that dress . ”
92887	92902	92903	92903	I	0	“ I could n’t wear anything underneath without the lines showing through my gown , ”
92927	92931	92914	92914	He	33	“ Come here . ”
92977	92995	92996	92996	He	33	“ Did making your ex watch as you sucked your husband ’s cock get you this wet ? ”
93007	93013	93004	93004	I	0	“ Yes , it did . ”
93020	93024	93025	93025	he	33	“ Good girl , ”
93028	93054	93025	93025	he	33	“ See ? You do know how to be good sometimes . If only you ’d been good for me the whole time , Faye . ”
93096	93130	93088	93088	he	33	“ You see … only good girls get to come . Filthy little sluts like you ? You just get used for my pleasure . You ’ll please me , wo n’t you ? ”
93131	93139	93140	93140	I	0	“ I ’ll do anything for you , ”
93153	93157	93158	93158	he	33	“ Good girl , ”
93166	93188	93158	93158	he	33	“ Now turn around , spread your legs , and bend over . Place your hands on your ankles for me . ”
93213	93219	93220	93220	he	33	“ Such a pretty pussy , ”
93290	93306	93277	93277	I	0	“ You want my tongue , huh ? What makes you think you deserve it ? ”
93307	93310	93311	93311	I	0	“ Please , ”
93360	93363	93364	93364	he	33	“ Mine , ”
93409	93414	93415	93415	I	0	“ Please , Dion , ”
93456	93489	93444	93444	He	33	“ You sound so sexy when you beg , baby . No one but me will ever taste this delicious pussy . It ’s mine . You are mine . Say it . ”
93513	93518	93519	93519	I	0	“ I ’m yours , ”
93522	93526	93519	93519	I	0	“ Only yours . ”
93539	93545	93536	93536	he	33	“ Damn right you are . ”
93631	93654	93655	93655	he	33	“ That ’s for looking so goddamn beautiful that not a single man could keep their eyes off you at your concert , ”
93704	93725	93658	93658	his	33	“ This is for the roses , though I ’m pleased with the way you destroyed a few of them . ”

Depending on my mood , I ’ll either force you to come so many times that you ’re begging for a reprieve , or I wo n’t let you come at all , keeping you at the edge until I give you permission to come . ”

94486	94557	94481	94481	He	1358	“ I ’m so proud of you , Faye . You ’re doing so well , but surely you realize that you deserve to be punished for enchanting me ? You make me want things I swear I ’d never even dream of , and now I ’ve had a taste of you , I can never go back to my life before you . You ’ve fucking ruined me . ”
94651	94660	94661	94661	he	1358	“ I ’ve got you , my love , ”

94733	94744	94727	94727	he	1358	“ Good , because I ’m not done with you . ”
94772	94786	94787	94787	he	1358	“ Tell me . Did I give you permission to come , Faye ? ”

95974	95979	95957	95957	I	0	“ How about this ? ”
96129	96132	96133	96133	she	1365	“ Wow , ”
96175	96181	96182	96182	I	0	“ Dion , that was … ”
96192	96217	96182	96182	I	0	“ You seem to like contemporary pieces much more than classical . Why do n’t you try adding an original composition to your concerts ? ”
96232	96239	96218	96218	She	1365	“ I … I could never . ”
96251	96255	96256	96256	I	0	“ You can , ”

96347	96373	96344	96344	her	1365	“ You really mean that , do n’t you ? If I wanted to start playing my own pieces , you ’d really support me . ”
96379	96383	96374	96374	I	0	“ Of course . ”
96419	96422	96423	96423	she	1365	“ Dion , ”
96430	96490	96423	96423	she	1365	“ I meant what I said last night . I want all of you , even the parts you try to hide from me . It was n’t something I said in the heat of the moment , nor will I take back those words . I want you to let me in . Do you think you could ? ”
96508	96520	96491	96491	She	1365	“ Could we have a real marriage , if we try ? ”
96568	96635	96561	96561	she	1365	“ I know what it ’s like to always have to showcase the best parts of you , and to fear what might happen if you let your fears show . But Dion , I also know how exhausting that is , and how much it wears you down . I think … maybe , you and I , maybe we could lean on each other . ”
96652	96687	96636	96636	I	0	“ I want to , Faye . I ’m trying . The idea of being happy with you no longer scares me as much as it used to , but it is n’t easy . ”
97197	97200	97201	97201	She	41	“ Chloe ! ”
97223	97226	97227	97227	she	41	“ Faye , ”
97266	97271	97272	97272	she	41	“ You look great , ”
97279	97294	97272	97272	she	41	“ I missed you , you know ? I doubt you feel the same . ”
97295	97303	97304	97304	I	0	“ Of course I missed you too , ”
97310	97339	97340	97340	I	0	“ I ’ve been calling and texting you every day , but you ’ve been so short with me , and I was n’t sure what to do . ”
97377	97381	97382	97382	I	0	“ What happened ? ”
97409	97427	97428	97428	she	41	“ What did you think would happen when Dion demanded that Dad give you the concert money ? ”
97431	97458	97428	97428	she	41	“ Of course he ’d never hand it over without a single hint of complaint . Just what did you think we ’d been living off ? ”
97474	97494	97495	97495	My	0	“ I was always told my concerts barely make enough to cover the production costs and my student debts . ”
97610	97618	97619	97619	I	0	“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
97629	97658	97619	97619	I	0	“ That amount of money could ’ve changed everything for us — we could ’ve been free from him , Chloe . We could ’ve run , together . ”
97675	97731	97732	97732	Her	41	“ It would have changed everything for you . I was happy at home , Faye . I did n’t want anything to change , and I definitely did n’t want to run away . Mom and Linda did n’t want to leave either . Your family is already broken , but ours is n’t . ”
97816	97833	97834	97834	she	41	“ Dion may have ignored you in the past , but he clearly adores you now , ”
97842	97867	97834	97834	she	41	“ Why is n’t that enough ? You do n’t really need the money , do you ? Not as much as we do . ”
97908	97917	97918	97918	I	0	“ I did n’t ask Dion to interfere , ”
97951	97965	97930	97930	I	0	“ You were there , Chloe . I did n’t say a word . ”
97966	98009	98010	98010	Her	41	“ But you did n’t stop him either , nor did you drop by to see if we were okay when you knew how mad Dad would be . I barely replied to your text messages , and you did n’t care . ”
98051	98127	98045	98045	I	0	“ I suppose in some ways , you left one controlling household to enter another , but at least Dion does it to protect you . He told us Windsor Tech makes all of your electronic devices , and he warned Dad against contacting you . He ’s having all of your incoming communications monitored , so even if I wanted to say anything to you about the situation at home , I could n’t . ”
98170	98271	98168	98168	he	33	“ Dad even tried coming to your last concert to speak to you in person , but Dion bought the entire building and banned him from entering the premises . You can pretty much guess what happened next , ca n’t you ? He came home and tore into Mom , breaking several of her bones . Because of you . Please , Faye , ca n’t you fix this ? I just want things to go back to how they used to be , so please , just be the sister you ’ve always been . Please , okay ? ”
98523	98527	98528	98528	I	0	“ What happened ? ”
98674	98677	98678	98678	she	1397	“ Dion , ”
98688	98705	98678	98678	she	1397	“ Did you cut off my family ’s access to me ? Are you monitoring me ? ”
98717	98720	98706	98706	I	0	“ Faye . ”
98748	98757	98733	98733	I	0	“ I was just trying to protect you . ”
98771	98789	98766	98766	her	1397	“ You were trying to control me , or you ’d have discussed this with me first . ”
98824	98922	98923	98923	Her	1401	“ I saw you at your father ’s house . They all dismissed you like you were some kind of accessory , and your father was clearly using you , embezzling funds from you . You were a shell of the woman I know you to be , Faye . You ’re right , of course . I should ’ve spoken to you , but I do n’t regret doing what I did . I ’m not going to sit back while someone uses you . I do n’t give a fuck if they ’re your family . ”
98936	98949	98930	98930	she	1401	“ Do n’t you see that you ’ve only made things worse ? ”
98960	98966	98967	98967	I	0	“ What happened , Faye ? ”
98987	98990	98991	98991	she	1401	“ Dion , ”
98998	99007	98991	98991	she	1401	“ I need … I need your help . ”
99040	99044	99045	99045	I	0	“ Tell me , ”
99080	99108	99064	99064	She	1401	“ It ’s my father . Do you remember that day at my house , after dinner ? You asked if my father was good to me . ”
99117	99130	99109	99109	I	0	“ I lied . But you knew that , did n’t you ? ”
99138	99141	99142	99142	I	0	“ Yes , ”
99145	99185	99142	99142	I	0	“ I ’ve been investigating him for months now . It ’s clear he tried to control you financially , and everything you told me about the way you were raised is in line with that motivation , but … ”
99213	99245	99186	99186	I	0	“ I could never determine the extent of his behavior . What I found was enough to make me want to cut him out of your life the way I did . ”
99286	99339	99340	99340	She	1402	“ He was n’t always like that , you know ? When I was younger , he treated me with such care . I ’m not sure if it ’s me he loved , or if he just loved my potential , but by the end , it was definitely the latter . ”
99355	99417	99340	99340	She	1402	“ At first , it was n’t so bad . I was never given the same freedom as my two half - sisters , but I loved the piano , so I did n’t mind so much . It was n’t until I was eight and told him I wanted to stop playing that he … that he first hit me . ”
99475	99605	99606	99606	She	1405	“ I was n’t allowed to quit , because he was so certain it would give me a way of bridging the distance you enforced . That ’s when he was the worst , you know ? Each time you were photographed with other women , or when you refused to see me despite being in the country , he ’d punish me . He did n’t care that I was a teenager throughout most of your indiscretions , or that our engagement was nothing but a verbal agreement that had little to do with either of us personally . I suppose it was n’t the insult that mattered — he was scared you ’d walk away from the deal between our families , and he needed the money . ”
99619	99690	99606	99606	She	1405	“ At first , he ’d apologize profusely and tell me that disciplining me was part of his job , that he was doing it for me . Over time , he did away with the excuses . You have no idea how many times I considered running away , but he ’d warned me if I tried , he ’d take out his anger on my stepmom and sisters . ”
99702	99869	99693	99693	her	1405	“ Do you have any idea how much it hurts to know that all I am is simply a product of your desires ? I have no idea who I ’d be if I had n’t been engaged to you from birth . Would I even be a pianist ? Would I have been allowed to make my own friends ? Would I have gone to college , and if I did , what would I have chosen to study ? I do n’t know , Dion . I have no idea who I ’d be if not for you , and I hated you for it . I did n’t think that would change , but you … you ’ve got me feeling so conflicted . You ’re nothing like what I was expecting , and for a while , I thought I was wrong about you . You made me believe that … that you would n’t control me the way my father did . ”
99881	99906	99907	99907	I	0	“ Everything I ’ve done is to protect you . I would never use you the way he did . Surely you see that ? ”
99940	99944	99937	99937	She	1406	“ I do . ”
99953	100114	99945	99945	Her	1406	“ I understand where you ’re coming from , Dion . But I … I just wish you ’d asked me before doing anything at all . Because you refused to talk to me first , you condemned my sisters . Shortly before we got married , my father stopped hurting me — instead , he ’d take his anger out on my little sister , and he ’d make me watch , reminding me it would n’t have happened if I ’d just obeyed , if I ’d tried harder at whatever it is he ’d decided to be mad about . When you cut him off like that , you endangered my sisters ’ lives , and I did n’t even realize it . The only reason I agreed to get married at all was so I could protect my sisters , and you took that from me . I … I do n’t know what to do . ”
100203	100210	100211	100211	She	1407	“ I can make him disappear . ”
100218	100274	100215	100215	her	1407	“ I ’d be no better than him if I hurt him , Dion . I do n’t want to become a monster like he is , and I do n’t want you to become one because of me either . Please do n’t stain your hands like that on my behalf . Promise me . ”
100321	100332	100333	100333	she	1407	“ I do n’t know what to do , Dion , ”
100342	100351	100333	100333	she	1407	“ but I do know I need help . ”
100352	100358	100359	100359	I	0	“ You ’ve got it , ”
100362	100368	100333	100333	she	1407	“ You ’ve got me . ”

100400	100411	100387	100387	Xavier	49	“ It ’s completely deserted at this time of night . ”
100412	100422	100423	100423	He	49	“ I ’ll see you in twenty minutes then . ”
100428	100459	100423	100423	He	49	“ I ’m not sure why you asked me to capture your father - in - law , but since it ’s you , I ’m certain he deserves it . ”
100460	100464	100465	100465	I	0	“ He does , ”
100525	100551	100552	100552	I	0	“ Good , because I picked up all your favorite tools on the way . I ’ll have him tied up and ready for you . ”
100584	100590	100591	100591	Xavier	49	“ Such a good friend . ”
100594	100599	100591	100591	Xavier	49	“ You owe me . ”
100621	100628	100600	100600	I	0	“ Fucking Kingstons and your favors . ”
100715	100719	100720	100720	he	49	“ You good ? ”
100730	100748	100720	100720	he	49	“ You look far more … conscientious than usual . You sure you want to do this ? ”
100841	100844	100845	100845	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
100860	100863	100864	100864	he	49	“ Dion , ”

100968	100980	100981	100981	he	57	“ I ’m offended you tried to hide this from us , ”
100999	101098	100989	100989	Lexington	59	“ Offended is n’t the word I ’d choose . More like fucking pissed off . Did you really think none of us realized what you ’ve been up to on our behalf ? The only reason we left you be was because we thought you needed it . We all felt that taking matters into your own hands the way you do would help you heal old wounds , but this ? What the fuck is this ? You need to learn to ask for help when you need it , Dion . We ’re your family . ”
101109	101143	101103	101103	his	47	“ Did you truly believe I would n’t realize that Hannah popped up in the Kingston mansion as a maid , or that you were behind her finally losing all her financial backing ? ”
101151	101238	101144	101144	Luca	43	“ And did you think I would n’t figure out who was behind Val ’s father ’s robbery ? You beat him to near - death and threw his wallet in the garbage bin closest to him . It was obvious it was n’t a robbery at all . It was revenge , and I ’m grateful for it , because despite my wishes , I could n’t have been the one to do it . I could n’t have faced my wife if I had . ”
101249	101301	101239	101239	Silas	45	“ Which is why you ’re going to stay out here while we handle Faye ’s father . I ’m well aware you were behind Mona ’s sudden death . She died the same way my father did , albeit behind bars , and I know I owe you for it . ”
101309	101417	101302	101302	Ares	47	“ Do you know why we allowed you to step in ? Why we kept quiet ? It ’s because you did what none of us could . Now that you ’re standing in our shoes , you finally get it , do n’t you ? If you go in there , you ’ll never be able to look your wife in the eye without feeling immense guilt . You wo n’t be able to keep this from her , and that secret will fester . It ’ll destroy your conscience . You ca n’t do something that might make Faye fear you , but we can . ”

101436	101469	101428	101428	They	1424	“ Of course we knew . You did your best to keep your secrets , Dion , but come on . We ’re Windsors , and we ’ve been worried about you . ”

My brothers … you should understand that marrying me did n’t just result in you having a husband . You also gained four big brothers and three relatively insane sisters . I … I was going to hurt him , but they found out and took over . You should know that if they had n’t , the outcome would ’ve been the same — I do n’t want you to think I ’m somehow less of a monster simply because I did n’t bloody my hands this time . I wo n’t deceive you like that . There simply is no world in which I ’d have let him get away with what he did to you unharmed . ”
102225	102240	102241	102241	He	1437	“ Do you remember when I told you that I wanted all of you ? ”
102245	102334	102335	102335	He	1438	“ I meant it , Dion . If it had been you , I would ’ve … I would have accepted that . When you told me that everything you do is to protect me , I was n’t in the right frame of mind to listen , but I hear you now . I might not be happy with the way you take matters into your own hands , but I trust you enough to believe you wo n’t hurt or control me the way he did . ”
102379	102388	102389	102389	he	1438	“ Do you still want that , Faye ? ”
102396	102418	102392	102392	his	1438	“ Now that I ’ve fully removed your father ’s hold on you , do you still want me ? Us ? ”
102436	102449	102450	102450	he	1438	“ You ’ve never had a choice when it came to me , ”
102453	102525	102450	102450	he	1438	“ You told me you have no idea who you would ’ve become if not for me , and no matter how I think about it , you ’re right . You deserve to have a choice . You should think about what you ’d do if you had one . In a world where you and I were n’t engaged since we were kids , would you have chosen me ? ”
102536	102549	102550	102550	He	1439	“ It does n’t matter , Dion . Why ponder rhetorical questions ? ”
102589	102593	102594	102594	he	1439	“ It does , ”
102597	102601	102594	102594	he	1439	“ It matters . ”
102762	102765	102766	102766	Abigail	39	“ Faye , ”
102801	102812	102782	102782	They	191	“ How could you do this to your own father ? ”
102824	102835	102836	102836	I	0	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re talking about , ”
102839	102858	102836	102836	I	0	“ I ’m as shocked as you are . I suppose some of Father ’s debts were due ? ”
102864	102893	102859	102859	Abigail	39	“ And whose fault is that ? If you had n’t taken away money that you do n’t even need , he would n’t be in this situation . ”
102970	103026	103030	103030	her	39	“ I should ’ve known when you refused to run with the girls and me instead of forcing me into marriage . Why would you ? Until recently , he left your daughters unharmed . You must ’ve genuinely believed that his anger would ’ve tempered once I was married and out of his sight . ”
103079	103145	103146	103146	I	0	“ I loved you , you know ? All of you . I realize now that the feeling was never quite mutual , but it ’s true . For years , I had a bag packed , an escape plan in mind . I stayed because I loved you enough to spare you from what Father would ’ve done to you if I ’d disappeared . ”
103185	103193	103194	103194	I	0	“ I ’m here to say goodbye , ”
103201	103283	103194	103194	I	0	“ I ’ll pay for Linda and Chloe ’s college tuition , because despite everything , I want both of them to have a future , but that ’s it . I ’m done being your puppet . I gave you a chance to walk away from Father , from this home , but you chose to stay even if it meant sacrificing my happiness and freedom . You made your decision , and I ’m finally ready to accept that . ”
103284	103287	103288	103288	Chloe	41	“ Faye , ”
103305	103308	103295	103295	I	0	“ No , ”
103325	103330	103309	103309	I	0	“ I ’m done . ”
103331	103334	103335	103335	Linda	40	“ Faye ! ”
103342	103390	103335	103335	Linda	40	“ You ’ll never get away with this . Make things right , and we ’ll forgive you . We wo n’t say a thing about what you did to Dad . We can still be a family , you know ? Do n’t you want that ? ”
103413	103423	103407	103407	I	0	“ I do have a family , at last . ”
103444	103511	103431	103431	he	33	“ Besides , it sounds like you do n’t quite realize who I am now . I ’m Faye Windsor . I had nothing to do with Father ’s accident , but it would n’t matter if I did . I could ’ve stabbed him in the heart and twisted the knife , and there ’s not a single thing you could ’ve done about it . ”
103534	103540	103541	103541	he	33	“ That ’s my girl , ”
103575	103580	103569	103569	he	33	“ Take me home . ”
103657	103796	103646	103646	she	144	“ She ’ll never forgive you , you know ? You ’ve done your best to ignore the past , and I commend you for it , but you ca n’t outrun it . She ’ll find out that you killed her mother , and you ’ll lose her . But you already know that , do n’t you ? A small part of yourself is prepared for it . Is n’t that why you ’ve been distancing yourself from her ? You ’re a monster , Dion . You were then , and you have n’t changed , have you ? You ’ve only gotten worse . If your brothers had n’t shown up , you ’d have gone in there , and we both know you would not have stopped until you made Faye an orphan . ”
103806	103870	103800	103800	her	1455	“ You know what ’s the worst part of these dreams ? I now have more memories of this version of you than I do of the real you , and I can no longer tell what ’s real . Did you hate me then too ? Do you truly blame me for what happened ? Mom , do I truly deserve this ? ”
103908	103912	103913	103913	she	1455	“ You do , ”
103917	104028	103913	103913	she	1455	“ You heard her , did n’t you ? She wanted to run away from you . Do you really think that ’s changed ? She ’s only staying because she thinks she owes you , because that ’s the kind of woman she is — she ’s responsible , and she ’ll repay her debts , no matter what it costs her . She never chose you , Dion . She ’s just making the best of a terrible situation , and you know it . Faye will never love you . How can she , when you ’re her captor ? You ’re no better than her father . ”
104041	104045	104046	104046	I	0	“ Stop it , ”
104049	104066	104046	104046	I	0	“ You do n’t know a thing about her , about us . I love her . ”
104067	104071	104072	104072	she	1457	“ Do you ? ”
104075	104109	104072	104072	she	1457	“ Do you even know what true love is ? Do you love her , or do you want to control and possess her ? Someone like you is n’t capable of love . ”
104123	104127	104128	104128	she	1457	“ Go on , ”
104131	104167	104128	104128	she	1457	“ Destroy her , the way you do everything else you touch . Just do n’t say I did n’t warn you when you ’re left holding the ruins of everything she could ’ve been . ”
104171	104174	104175	104175	I	0	“ Dion ! ”
104193	104197	104198	104198	she	1457	“ Oh God , ”
104207	104219	104198	104198	she	1457	“ I was so worried . You would n’t wake up . ”
104258	104261	104240	104240	she	1457	“ Faye . ”
104307	104344	104301	104301	her	1457	“ What happened ? What did you dream about ? I ’ve never seen you like that , Dion . You were thrashing in your sleep , begging for something and apologizing over and over again . ”
104382	104387	104388	104388	I	0	“ She ’s right , ”
104391	104408	104388	104388	I	0	“ I ’ll lose you eventually , wo n’t I ? You ’ll never forgive me . ”
104409	104415	104416	104416	she	144	“ Forgive you for what ? ”
104519	104532	104533	104533	She	144	“ I ’m the reason my parents and your mother are dead . ”
104542	104552	104553	104553	she	144	“ Dion , they died in a plane crash , ”
104563	104567	104553	104553	she	144	“ I know . ”
104598	104644	104645	104645	I	0	“ They would n’t have been on that plane if not for me , Faye . They ’d gone to London because they ’d been in the process of expanding the Staccato Foundation , and their negotiations had n’t gone as smoothly as they expected . ”
104665	104814	104815	104815	She	1464	“ I … I had a concert . It was my first big solo concert , and I begged my parents and your mom to come back for it . I told them I ’d never forgive them if I had to walk onto that stage without them , and I accused them of caring more about the kids at the foundation than about me . We had a terrible fight that racked up a huge telephone bill . Your mom tried to appease me , but I would n’t listen . She promised me she ’d be at my next few performances , you know ? Told me she would n’t miss them for the world , that she ’d bring you too , and that you ’d cheer me on together . The last thing I told her was that I hated her and my parents . ”
104827	104847	104815	104815	She	1464	“ Dion , you were twelve . Of course you wanted your parents with you for something so terrifying . ”
104864	104949	104848	104848	I	0	“ They flew back early to attend my concert , Faye . You lost your mother because of me . Do you see how different your life would ’ve been if she ’d been there ? It ’s not just her you lost . I took away the childhood that rightfully should ’ve been yours . I know that , and despite that , I still want more . I ’ve taken so much from you , yet I still want your heart too . ”
104964	104967	104968	104968	she	1465	“ Dion , ”
104971	104986	104968	104968	she	1465	“ You ’ve got it . My heart is yours . I ’m yours . ”
105010	105088	105089	105089	She	1466	“ Do you hear yourself , Dion ? You were a child . You are n’t to blame for what happened to my mother and your parents . I do n’t blame you . I understand the circumstances fueled your guilt , but my love , you did n’t cause that plane to crash . You , Dion Windsor , are powerful beyond measure — but you ’re not that powerful . You did n’t do this . ”
105128	105138	105139	105139	she	1466	“ How long have you been carrying that guilt ? ”
105146	105160	105139	105139	she	1466	“ Is this why you were running away from me for so long ? ”
105173	105253	105161	105161	I	0	“ I was in therapy for years , Faye . Rationally , I know I did n’t … I did n’t kill them . But a small part of me continues to believe it , and I ’d be lying if I said that was n’t the reason I could n’t face you . Logically , I understand I did n’t cause their accident , but if not for me , they would n’t have been on that plane . ”
105254	105263	105264	105264	She	1466	“ Is that what your dreams are about ? ”
105277	105329	105272	105272	I	0	“ Dion , this is n’t the first night that one of your nightmares woke me up . I ’ve never said anything because it seemed deeply personal , and you ’ve always fallen back asleep soon after , but it has n’t gone unnoticed . What do you dream of ? ”
105342	105346	105347	105347	I	0	“ My mother , ”
105358	105405	105347	105347	I	0	“ I dream of her telling me I ’m a monster and that I killed her . It ’s the reason I ca n’t let go . Each time I try , she appears , reminding me that I do n’t deserve to escape the guilt . ”
105419	105423	105424	105424	she	1466	“ You do , ”
105427	105445	105424	105424	she	1466	“ You deserve to be free of guilt , and you deserve to be happy , Dion . ”
105446	105502	105503	105503	She	1466	“ You would n’t say that if you knew what I ’ve done . I hear you , baby . I was a child when my parents died , but everything since then ? My hands are n’t clean , and no matter what I do , I ca n’t erase the stains on them . ”
105517	105522	105523	105523	she	1466	“ My darling husband , ”
105533	105565	105523	105523	she	1466	“ You ’re a Windsor . Name one powerful man with a clear conscience , one man who wo n’t break the law and his own morals to protect his own . ”
105576	105700	105571	105571	she	1466	“ When I married you , I thought you were a monster , Dion . I thought you were just like my father , that you ’d hurt me until I was completely broken and molded into what you wanted me to be . I could n’t have been more wrong . You built me up , supported me unconditionally , and you ’ve protected me in a way I never would ’ve expected of you . If you tore anything down at all , it ’s the walls I built . I love you , Dion . All of you , even the parts you think are unworthy . Will you let me ? Will you let me love you , Dion ? ”
106301	106304	106305	106305	she	48	“ Faye ! ”
106355	106399	106408	106408	she	1477	“ Raven , hi ! Do you think … I mean , um , I know you ’re really busy . But I was just wondering if you ’d … well , I ’d like to dye my hair , and I thought — ”
106400	106407	106408	106408	she	1477	“ I know the perfect hairdresser , ”
106416	106429	106408	106408	she	1477	“ Give me ten minutes , and I ’ll pick you up . ”
106481	106485	106488	106488	her	1477	“ Thank you , ”
106496	106540	106488	106488	her	1477	“ I did n’t want to go by myself , and honestly , I ’m still not sure this is even a good idea . Maybe … maybe I should tell Dion ? I ’m not sure he ’d like it if I — ”
106561	106565	106566	106566	I	0	“ Never mind , ”
106570	106589	106566	106566	I	0	“ I ’ve wanted to dye my hair for years now , and I think it ’s time . ”
106611	106648	106602	106602	she	1477	“ Honestly , sometimes you just need a physical transformation to help you with your mental ones . I ’m not entirely sure what you ’re going through , but I ’m happy you reached out . ”
106660	106680	106657	106657	she	1477	“ You look hot in the jeans , by the way . Has Dion seen you like that yet ? ”
106691	106706	106707	106707	She	1477	“ No . I … this is the first time I ’ve worn them . ”
106711	106786	106707	106707	She	1477	“ You do n’t see it , but I do . The woman that walked down the aisle and the one seated next to me are two entirely different people . You ’ve flourished the way I was hoping you would . I guess by now the whole world knows that Ares was meant to marry my sister instead of me , so I ’m sure you understand our situations were n’t so dissimilar . ”
106802	106877	106794	106794	her	1477	“ When I married Ares , I also thought I was unwanted , and that he ’d never love me . Yet just like you , I flourished in my marriage . There ’s just something about these Windsor men , huh ? Their hopeless devotion and their unwillingness to give up on you despite the odds , the past , the stakes . It wears a girl down in all the best ways . ”
106898	106902	106903	106903	I	0	“ It does , ”
106919	106945	106906	106906	Raven	48	“ I just hope you ’ll offer him the same devotion , Faye . Dion … he needs you more than you ’ll ever know . ”
106946	106950	106951	106951	I	0	“ I will , ”
107026	107033	107034	107035	the receptionist	1486	“ We ’re fully booked today , ”
107050	107055	107056	107056	she	1486	“ Is that so ? ”
107063	107099	107056	107056	she	1486	“ In that case , could you please let Max Giovanni know that Raven and Faye Windsor dropped by ? Please send him my love . I ’ll just see him some other time then . ”
107119	107122	107123	107123	she	1486	“ Oh , ”
107126	107158	107123	107123	she	1486	“ Raven Windsor . I … I ’m so sorry for not recognizing you straight away . Please , take a seat . I ’ll get Max for you straight away . ”
107177	107217	107172	107172	she	48	“ Being able to say that he was responsible for the color of one of the Windsor ladies is invaluable for Max . It does n’t matter what ’s on his schedule . He ’ll drop it for us . ”
107270	107282	107283	107283	I	0	“ You do n’t have to do this , you know ? ”
107297	107301	107290	107290	She	48	“ Do what ? ”
107302	107349	107350	107350	Raven	48	“ You do n’t have to force yourself to stay . I ’ll be okay by myself . Honestly , I did n’t expect you to come with me at all . I thought you ’d just give me a recommendation and leave it at that . ”
107359	107397	107356	107356	her	48	“ Sweetheart , you and Dion are far more alike than you realize . Is it really so hard for you to believe that I want to spend some time with my sister - in - law ? ”
107412	107437	107404	107404	she	48	“ Like I said , you and I are more similar than you realize . I ’ve mentioned my sister , have n’t I ? ”
107478	107563	107564	107564	I	0	“ My sister and I never had the kind of bond that I ’ve always wanted . I know what it ’s like to feel out of place in the home you grew up in , and I recognize that need to belong somewhere . Me being here is n’t a favor , Faye . I ’m here because I ’ve always desperately wanted real sisters , and I found them in Sierra and Val . I was just hoping to have one more . ”
107573	107579	107580	107580	I	0	“ I ’d like that , ”
107688	107691	107675	107675	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
107761	107785	107786	107786	I	0	“ Um … do you like it ? I always wanted to dye it , but maybe I was a little too impulsive . ”
107803	107807	107808	107808	I	0	“ Fucking stunning , ”
107899	107906	107907	107907	I	0	“ I love you in jeans , ”
107910	107922	107907	107907	I	0	“ And your hair ? It ’s really beautiful , darling . ”
107951	107961	107962	107962	I	0	“ I was worried you would n’t like it . ”
107974	108015	108016	108016	I	0	“ You ’re always beautiful , Faye . You could ’ve dyed your hair any color , and it would ’ve suited you … but this ? Fuck . I thought you looked hot before , but this is unreal . ”
108035	108043	108044	108044	I	0	“ You wo n’t be laughing soon , ”
108111	108116	108117	108117	I	0	“ On your knees , ”
108122	108132	108117	108117	I	0	“ I need to be inside you , now . ”
108159	108162	108163	108163	I	0	“ Fuck , ”

108311	108323	108324	108324	I	0	“ You want to come all over your husband ’s face ? ”
108330	108333	108334	108334	she	333	“ Yes , ”
108342	108346	108334	108334	she	333	“ Good girl . ”
108393	108398	108399	108399	she	333	“ Please , Dion , ”
108450	108457	108458	108458	I	0	“ Come for me , baby , ”
108526	108529	108530	108530	I	0	“ Nope , ”

108654	108659	108660	108660	I	0	“ So fucking good , ”

108709	108741	108742	108742	I	0	“ You ’re dripping for me , baby . I ca n’t get you much wetter . You can do this , my love . You can take all of me . ”

109623	109685	109615	109615	I	0	“ Mrs. Windsor ! Is it true your in - laws were responsible for the collapse of your father ’s mines ? Is that why Windsor Media has tried to suppress the news ? Are you getting a divorce ? Why is your father in the hospital ? It ca n’t be a coincidence ! Is it all an insurance scam ? ”
109822	109832	109833	109833	Garret	80	“ Shall I take you home , Mrs. Windsor ? ”

109993	110031	109990	109990	She	1486	“ Mrs. Windsor ’s schedule is packed . You will have to make an appointment to see her . I ’m afraid it ’s near impossible to just walk in here and demand to see the COO . ”
110032	110042	110043	110043	Her	1486	“ Um , then , is Luca here maybe ? ”
110054	110078	110051	110051	she	1486	“ I ’m afraid not . Mr. and Mrs. Windsor are both occupied this afternoon . Would you like to make an appointment ? ”
110110	110154	110155	110155	She	1513	“ Look , I left my phone in the car or I ’d have called her myself . Could you please ring her and let her know Faye is here to see her ? I assure you she wo n’t send me away . ”

110644	110662	110663	110663	She	60	“ Faye , sweetheart ! What are you doing here ? This is such a pleasant surprise . ”
110685	110690	110691	110691	she	60	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
110698	110716	110717	110717	She	60	“ Faye , you ’re trembling , and you ’re worrying me . What ’s going on ? ”

110748	110799	110744	110744	I	0	“ I was just wondering about something . I realize that this is inappropriate , and likely an abuse of power , and if I ask this of you , I might destroy any relationship we could ’ve had . You might find me immoral and horrible , but I — ”
110808	110813	110800	110800	She	60	“ Just tell me . ”
110814	110830	110831	110831	Her	60	“ Is it true that your father ’s family controls most of the insurance industry ? ”
110845	110862	110842	110842	her	60	“ Not exactly , but my uncle does own the largest insurance firm in the world . ”
110863	110887	110888	110888	She	60	“ Would you … would you be in a position to deny an insurance claim , if … if it comes to it ? ”
110899	110905	110906	110906	she	60	“ You had me worried , ”
110909	110947	110906	110906	she	60	“ Do you really think I ’d let our family ’s hard work go to waste ? Your father wo n’t see a single penny . He ’s done . He ’ll be charged with insurance fraud . ”
110948	110952	110953	110953	I	0	“ You knew , ”
110968	111028	110956	110956	She	60	“ Of course . There ’s no way my husband could come home with blood on his clothes without explaining to me exactly how that happened . I ’m so proud of him and the boys for standing up for you , and I ’ll do my part where I can . You ’re not alone anymore , Faye . ”
111037	111052	110956	110956	She	60	“ Did Dion tell you about … about my father ’s violence toward me ? ”
111132	111135	111136	111136	she	60	“ No , ”
111143	111153	111136	111136	she	60	“ I only knew about him stealing your money . ”
111163	111178	111160	111160	her	60	“ I guess that explains why Luca was so cagey when he got home . ”
111191	111230	111179	111179	Val	60	“ Do n’t you worry about a thing , sweetie . I ’ll handle any insurance claims that might arise , and the boys will handle everything else . Could I ask for something in return , though ? ”
111244	111248	111249	111249	She	60	“ Of course . ”
111269	111293	111294	111294	she	60	“ I do n’t need to remind you of the date , because you lost your mother on the same day , but … ”
111307	111371	111294	111294	she	60	“ Normally , the Windsor siblings gather to reminisce and celebrate their sweetest memories on the anniversary of their parents ’ death , but it is n’t the same for Dion . He ’s always hidden himself away , and I ’m worried he ’ll do the same this year . Please , Faye . Do n’t let him be alone next week . ”
111379	111384	111294	111294	she	60	“ I wo n’t , ”
111388	111404	111405	111405	She	1523	“ I hear you , Val . I wo n’t let him push me away . ”

111681	111761	111762	111762	I	0	“ My parents ’ home . It ’s odd , you know ? That piano behind you always haunted me , but you took away its power and restored it to what it used to be . That ’s what you do to me . You take each broken piece , and without even realizing it , you put me back together . I do n’t deserve you , but fuck , am I grateful I ’ve got you . ”
111811	111845	111806	111806	his	1526	“ You are both my torment and my salvation , my muse and my damnation . For you , I ’ll willingly go to the depths of hell . Did you know that ? ”
111884	111926	111927	111927	His	1526	“ I know , but I hope you realize I ’ll be there every step of the way . You do n’t want to lead me to hell , do you ? If you burn , I ’ll burn with you . ”
111948	111999	112000	112000	He	1526	“ No matter where you go , I ’ll be right by your side , Dion . You once told me that my broken pieces complete you , yet you find it hard to believe I feel the same way . I wish you could see yourself through my eyes . ”
112013	112022	112000	112000	He	1526	“ Will you play for me , angel ? ”
112023	112031	112032	112032	I	0	“ I ’ll do anything for you . ”
112045	112060	112032	112032	I	0	“ Do you want to sit ? We can play together if you want ? ”
112090	112203	112086	112086	he	1526	“ No , I just need to hear you play La Campanella for me . Did you know that my heart nearly stopped that night I walked into the house to find you playing my mother ’s favorite piece on her piano ? I had n’t been able to listen to it for years , but there you were , looking like a fucking goddess . I was powerless before you , unable to look away or speak a single word in defiance of your presence . Make me feel that way again , Faye . Enthrall me . Enchant me . Do to me what no one but you can do . ”
112330	112334	112335	112335	he	33	“ Keep playing , ”
112349	112386	112387	112387	He	33	“ You take away the pain , Faye . You make me forget , and you give me hope I do n’t deserve to have . When I ’m touching you , everything else fades away . ”
112562	112565	112566	112566	he	33	“ Again , ”
112575	112588	112566	112566	he	33	“ Play it until it no longer hurts , Faye . Please . ”
112729	112732	112733	112733	I	0	“ More , ”

112902	112911	112912	112912	he	33	“ You like that , do n’t you ? ”
112923	112944	112912	112912	he	33	“ You ’re such a good girl , Faye . Tell me , does this good girl deserve to come ? ”

113145	113178	113142	113142	he	33	“ I ’ve been so selfish today , angel . I know today is tough for you , too , but here I am , asking so much of you . Fuck . ”

113200	113242	113197	113197	I	0	“ This was perfect . It ’s exactly what I needed , so do n’t take this from me , okay ? Do n’t let your guilt warp an experience that ’s bound to stay with me for years to come . ”

Every single day , I ’ll do everything in my power to become worthy of you . I ’ll never stop fighting for you , for us . ”

113684	113694	113695	113695	I	0	“ What can I do for you , Grandma ? ”
113739	113756	113757	113757	she	34	“ I understand Faye ’s father miraculously found himself in the hospital with countless broken bones , ”
113761	113796	113757	113757	she	34	“ He claims he has no recollection of what happened . Weird , is n’t it ? Even more so , considering all of his mines collapsed on the same day he went missing . ”
113801	113812	113797	113797	I	0	“ I ’d heard of that . Such a shame . ”
113818	113838	113815	113815	her	34	“ It was even more curious that Silas Sinclair could n’t find out a thing about any of it . ”
113846	113882	113839	113839	I	0	“ That ’s so weird . But then again , Silas tends to have his own agenda . He has a habit of defying you when he disagrees with your methods , you know that . ”
113894	113899	113900	113900	she	34	“ Cut the crap , ”
113903	113921	113900	113900	she	34	“ What happened ? What could he possibly have done for you to destroy him so thoroughly ? ”
113931	113998	113922	113922	I	0	“ It is n’t my story to tell , Grandma . Just trust that he deserved what he got . All I can really tell you is that he was embezzling Faye ’s concert income for years and led her to believe she was n’t earning much at all . He made her financially dependent on him and tried to control her every action until recently . ”
114021	114074	114012	114012	she	34	“ I tried to protect her , you know ? It was your mothers who decided the two of you should get engaged , but they had no plans to bring it up until you were much older . I enforced that engagement in an effort to maintain my ties to Faye . ”
114094	114208	114209	114209	I	0	“ Faye ’s father has always been rough , and neither your mother nor I ever liked him . When we lost Felicity and your parents , I was worried about what might happen to Faye . I felt that the engagement was one of very few ways I could tie her to us . I wanted to keep an eye on her and be there for her as she grew up , without necessarily intruding . Jimmy had always been money - motivated , so I thought offering the amount I did would ensure he ’d treat her with care . Was I wrong , Dion ? Did my actions harm her ? ”
114329	114335	114336	114336	I	0	“ I ’m not sure , ”
114341	114365	114336	114336	I	0	“ I wish that was a question I could answer , Grams , because it ’s one I ’ve asked myself countless times . ”
114380	114406	114374	114374	she	34	“ I ’m the one who set all of this into motion , but it was never my intention to make both of you miserable . ”
114415	114481	114482	114482	She	34	“ You might find me meddlesome , but everything I do is for you and your siblings . As the years passed , I became convinced that being with her would heal you , that it would be a way for you to move beyond the past , together . I never intended to make matters worse , but I have , have n’t I ? ”
114495	114500	114501	114501	I	0	“ You have n’t , ”
114505	114574	114501	114501	I	0	“ I hate to admit this , but I … I ’m happy with her , Grandma . I wo n’t lie to you and say the past does n’t still haunt me , but she loosened its hold over me . Being with her gives me purpose . Faye is n’t anything like what I expected , and she makes me want to be a better man . ”
114588	114654	114585	114585	her	34	“ Does she feel the same way ? I wanted to save her , Dion , not entrap her . If what you ’re telling me about her father is true , then how are we any better ? The rules I laid down were meant to bring you two closer — it was never my intention to suffocate her the way he must have . ”
114670	114717	114655	114655	I	0	“ She tells me she loves me , and I think I believe her . I ’m not sure she truly is as happy as she ’d like me to think , but there ’s nothing I wo n’t do to turn her lies into reality . ”
114735	114738	114739	114739	she	34	“ Dion , ”
114746	114777	114739	114739	she	34	“ I wo n’t hold you to our agreement . If you two truly are happy together , then you have my unconditional blessing , but if you are n’t … ”
114791	114803	114780	114780	her	34	“ We ca n’t do to her what her father did . ”
114815	114824	114825	114825	She	34	“ What exactly are you saying , Grandma ? ”
114829	114889	114825	114825	She	34	“ I ’m saying that I ’ll grant you a divorce if you think it ’s in either of your best interests . It ’s not my intention to harm Faye , and if you believe that ’s what I ’ve done by forcing you into this marriage , I ’ll do what I can to make it right . ”
114994	114997	114998	114998	He	33	“ Dion ? ”
115036	115039	115040	115040	he	33	“ Fuck , ”
115064	115073	115051	115051	he	33	“ Do you mind if I join you ? ”
115198	115208	115209	115209	he	33	“ Champagne , moonlight , and my sexy wife , ”
115232	115235	115226	115226	he	33	“ Perfection . ”
115236	115241	115242	115242	I	0	“ I missed you , ”
115286	115294	115295	115295	he	33	“ I missed you too , angel , ”

121187	121293	121294	121294	He	1626	“ I love you , Faye . I really do want to make all of your dreams come true , but is that the right thing to do ? You deserve a choice , baby . With me , your dreams have to fit into the few free days I have every once in a while . You ’ll never have the true freedom you crave . You should be able to chase your dreams on your terms — not mine . I desperately want to be selfish with you , but I ca n’t . I love you too much to clip your wings . ”
121311	121430	121294	121294	He	1626	“ If you want me to let you go , I will . All of this … the adventures , traveling , everything you wanted to do before me . You can have all of that , if it ’s what you want . You deserve to have a choice . I spoke to my grandmother , and she assured me we can get a divorce without any penalties if it ’s what you want . I do n’t want to do to you what your father did , Faye . I ca n’t . I wo n’t control you simply because I ca n’t imagine a life without you . My needs should never come before yours . ”
121471	121475	121476	121476	I	0	“ I do , ”
121479	121496	121476	121476	I	0	“ I do deserve a choice . I ’ve never had one before , you know ? ”
121525	121561	121562	121562	He	33	“ Dion , every second of every day , I choose you . Even when you do n’t want me to . Even on days that feel impossibly hard . I ’ll always choose you . ”
121665	121671	121672	121674	the taller one	1631	“ Mr. and Mrs. Windsor , ”

121743	121783	121732	121732	they	1632	“ Theo and I apprehended Mrs. Windsor ’s father outside the premises . He insists on speaking to you and is threatening to go to the press if we deny him entry . How would you like to proceed ? ”
121797	121806	121807	121807	Dion	33	“ Must ’ve come directly from the hospital , ”
121810	121832	121807	121807	Dion	33	“ I suppose this was to be expected . It ’s been an awfully quiet few weeks while he was recovering . ”
121846	121866	121833	121833	He	33	“ What would you like to do , angel ? We can simply send him away if you want . ”
121886	121913	121881	121881	I	0	“ I ’m worried about what he might say to the paparazzi . I think … I think it would be better to hear him out . ”
121926	121933	121923	121923	he	33	“ Whatever you want , darling . ”
121956	121967	121968	121968	he	33	“ Remember that you are n’t alone anymore , okay ? ”
122011	122033	122008	122008	his	33	“ I can make him disappear if you want , you know ? It ’s not too late to do that . ”
122092	122095	122096	122096	Father	38	“ Faye , ”
122143	122160	122161	122161	He	33	“ Father . I ’m glad to see you ’re doing well after that unfortunate robbery . ”
122258	122261	122262	122262	he	33	“ Robbery , ”
122335	122387	122388	122388	He	33	“ It ’s one thing to touch me , but it ’s something else entirely to touch my mines . You ’re insane if you think you can pin it on me . I ’ve been accused of insurance fraud because of you . You will not get away with this . ”
122402	122432	122388	122388	He	33	“ Here is what will happen . You will pay me twice the amount of damage you caused , and I will continue to feign ignorance about my injuries . ”
122474	122547	122548	122548	Dion	33	“ I ’m not walking out of here without a written agreement . Fail to meet my terms , and I ’ll go talk to The Herald . They ’d love to hear all about how the Windsor brothers rounded me up and beat me , one by one , taunting me as they told me about the bombs they placed in my mines . You will never get away with this . ”
122562	122573	122574	122574	he	33	“ There ’s evidence of your father buying those bombs , ”
122578	122707	122574	122574	he	33	“ Courtesy of our favorite Kingston brother . Just thought you should know that . Even if he talks , there ’s a paper trail leading directly to him . It ’ll just sound like he ’s trying to frame and exploit us . If you want to talk to the press , we can spin the story so he ’s outed for the abusive , controlling asshole he is , and every single word he utters will just be another stone pulled from his foundation , until it all comes tumbling down on him . As for his injuries ? There ’s a huge paper trail proving his countless debts . You do n’t need to fear the press , Faye . No one will believe him . ”
122817	122854	122806	122806	he	33	“ What do you think , Faye ? I ’ll do whatever you want me to do . You do n’t need to worry about the miners either , Windsor Enterprises offered all of them jobs . ”
122902	122913	122914	122914	I	0	“ I think your kindness was wasted on my father , ”
122917	122933	122934	122934	Dion	33	“ It ’s clear he does n’t value his life , so why should we ? ”
122968	123012	123013	123013	He	33	“ Dion , I do n’t want to see him anymore . Not ever again . I ’m tired of being threatened and exploited . If we give in now , then where does it end ? I ca n’t do this anymore . ”
123027	123030	123031	123031	he	33	“ Understood , ”
123076	123126	123047	123047	his	33	“ You heard my wife . Get him out of our house , and out of our lives . Give him a chance to run , but if he does n’t heed my words and attempts to appear in front of my wife ever again , remove him permanently . ”
123189	123210	123211	123216	the CEO of the development firm	1655	“ I ’m afraid we ca n’t accept your offer , but perhaps we can meet somewhere in the middle ? ”

123322	123325	123326	123326	I	0	“ No , ”
123330	123366	123326	123326	I	0	“ I ’m sorry to hear you do n’t find our offer acceptable . Though Windsor Enterprises would have loved to work with you , it appears that wo n’t be possible at this time . ”

123669	123706	123661	123661	she	62	“ She would ’ve come round , and you know it . This is a great deal . Sierra is n’t going to be pleased if she hears you backed out of this without good reason . ”
123722	123753	123754	123754	Maria	62	“ Since when do I work for my sister ? And at what point did you gather the courage to speak on her behalf like you know her at all ? ”
123761	123770	123771	123771	she	62	“ I did n’t mean it that way , ”
123775	123789	123771	123771	she	62	“ It just feels like you ’re walking out of these negotiations prematurely . ”
123790	123818	123819	123819	She	62	“ Last I checked , that was my call to make . I do n’t recall second - guessing my decisions being part of your job spec . ”
123837	123864	123833	123833	her	62	“ Look , Maria . I appreciate you as an employee , I truly do . But you need to understand this is not a partnership . ”
123918	123923	123924	123924	she	62	“ You ’ve changed , ”
123942	123948	123949	123949	I	0	“ I should hope so , ”
123953	124085	123949	123949	I	0	“ I ’ve never felt more like myself than I do these days . I ’m no longer going through the motions , obsessed with work merely because it was an escape . You have no idea , Maria . I used to love going to sleep more than anything , because it meant a few hours of peace on nights my nightmares would spare me . Now ? Now I ’m scared I ’ll blink and miss a moment I want to commit to memory . When I married Faye , I told her I ’d start counting my blessings , because that ’s what I thought each day with her would be — a blessing . I did n’t realize how true those words would turn out to be . ”
124121	124129	124130	124130	she	1674	“ You ’re in love with her , ”
124137	124141	124142	124142	I	0	“ Hopelessly so , ”
124145	124153	124142	124142	I	0	“ Does she feel the same way ? ”
124164	124172	124154	124154	I	0	“ Yes . I believe she does . ”
124187	124250	124184	124184	her	1674	“ Do you know what hurts the most ? I ’ve been trying to make you smile like that for years now , and the mere memory of her does what I never could . I just thought … if I just waited long enough , once your three years with her passed , then maybe you ’d finally look at me . ”
124319	124324	124325	124325	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
124329	124362	124325	124325	I	0	“ I love my wife more than anything , and that wo n’t ever change . If I have ever done anything to make you believe otherwise , then I sincerely apologize . ”

124375	124389	124372	124372	she	1674	“ You never have . You ’ve never been anything but perfectly professional . ”
124400	124413	124390	124390	She	1674	“ Thank you , Dion . I just needed to hear that . ”

124461	124489	124457	124457	I	0	“ I ’d hate to lose you as my secretary , but if you wish to leave , I ’ll write you a glowing letter of recommendation . ”
124542	124556	124557	124557	Maria	62	“ I think I ’m ready to take you up on that offer , ”
124568	124580	124560	124560	her	62	“ I ’ll spend our entire flight writing it for you . ”
124743	124756	124736	124736	She	2213	“ Dion ! Is n’t it super late for you right now ? ”
124772	124777	124778	124778	I	0	“ Could n’t sleep , ”
124781	124790	124791	124791	She	2213	“ What are you up to , darling ? ”
124828	124868	124869	124869	I	0	“ Nothing much . Sierra told me about this movie she loved , so I thought I might watch it and snuggle up on the sofa . What about you ? What happened ? Did you have a nightmare ? ”
124988	124994	124995	124995	I	0	“ Yeah , a nightmare , ”
124998	125025	124995	124995	I	0	“ Hey , you know what ? I think I ’ll try to go back to bed . I ’ll speak to you later , alright ? ”
125026	125038	125039	125039	she	2213	“ That ’s probably a good idea . Dream of me , ”
125046	125053	125039	125039	she	2213	“ I love you . Night ! ”

125199	125230	125192	125192	he	45	“ I was n’t informed that you ’d be returning ahead of schedule . I ’d have handled the border security clearance for you if you ’d let me know . ”

126070	126118	126054	126054	she	1697	“ I bought this house with the money I earned from my concerts . I just … I just wanted to have a place that was completely my own . Somewhere I could go sometimes , a home that no one could ever take away from me . ”
126136	126178	126127	126127	my	0	“ Were you ever going to tell me ? You pretended to be home when I called you , Faye . Do you have any idea what it was like to be standing in our home while you lied to me ? ”

126196	126213	126193	126193	she	1717	“ I would ’ve told you eventually , I just could n’t find the right time . ”

126297	126306	126307	126307	Her	1717	“ Dion , I ’m so incredibly sorry . ”
126345	126412	126339	126339	I	0	“ I do n’t know how to explain in a way that ’d make you understand , but I ’ll try . It is n’t … it ’s not because of you , personally . I just … I just always wanted a home of my own . Somewhere I ’d always be safe , where I could go if I ever felt unwanted anywhere else . ”
126413	126472	126503	126503	I	0	“ What about the home we built together , Faye ? The home you decorated all by yourself ? That place where you play my mother ’s piano , where you let me fuck you into the couch , where we wake up together ? What about that place ? Is n’t that your home ? Our home ? ”
126473	126480	126481	126481	she	1719	“ It … it ’s yours , ”
126484	126502	126481	126481	she	1719	“ If … if you ever left me , or if … if you ever hurt me … ”

126555	126598	126548	126548	I	0	“ Faye , what more can I do to prove to you that I ’m in this for the long haul ? How do I make you feel safe with me ? I would never hurt you . Surely you know that ? ”
126599	126605	126606	126606	she	1720	“ I … I know , ”
126708	126761	126762	126762	I	0	“ Remember that afternoon in Rome ? We were dancing in the rain , and you told me that you chose me . Every second of every day , even when I do n’t want you to , even on days that feel impossibly hard . Is n’t that what you said ? ”
126805	126825	126801	126801	I	0	“ You did n’t choose me , Faye . Not wholeheartedly . Not the way I need you to . ”

126876	126956	126865	126865	he	44	“ A few weeks before your one - year wedding anniversary , no less . You two did n’t last very long at all , did you ? I was so sure I ’d have to wait the full three years , and I would have , you know ? For her , I would have . I ’m not sure how you got out of your grandmother ’s terms and conditions , but I ’m grateful for it . ”

127205	127266	127202	127202	Eric	44	“ She never wanted you , Dion . It was me she was dating while she was engaged to you . She held onto me until the very last second , and you know it . I never stopped waiting for her , and now I ’ve finally got a real shot with her . I wo n’t waste it . ”
127312	127438	127439	127439	I	0	“ Even if she does give you another chance , you ’ll never have all of her . She ’ll compare you to me every single day , and you ’ll never be able to measure up . You ca n’t book out The Louvre for her so she can see the Mona Lisa in peace , like I did a few weeks ago . Nor can you buy orchestra halls , so she ’ll be able to hold her concerts in the best places in the city with little notice . Do you even know what she needs after a long day , or what to do if she ca n’t sleep ? Would you be able to protect her the way I can ? ”
127454	127484	127441	127441	my	0	“ Even if she ’s with you , the whole world will remember her being mine . Even if you could , no one else will let you forget . ”
127497	127574	127575	127575	He	1727	“ And you wo n’t , will you ? You ’ll never forget the way she took my cock in her dressing room , or how desperate she was for it . She loved it . Did you know we took your roses home that day ? She spread the petals on our bed and asked me to fuck her on top of them . One of my best memories , so thank you for that . ”
127616	127665	127666	127666	I	0	“ Dion , I do n’t care if the whole world thinks of her as your ex - wife , so long as I ’m the one by her side . As for everything else ? Well , thanks for teaching her things I ’m sure to enjoy . ”

127761	127841	127757	127757	I	0	“ So I keep dried chamomile flowers in the house , just for her . And when she ca n’t sleep , she likes to compose . She ’ll hide out in the living room and hum tunes as her mind works through the notes . She likes input though , so if you can give it to her , she ’ll appreciate it . That ’s how you can get her to fall back asleep on rough nights . ”
127858	127969	127851	127851	I	0	“ I love her , Eric . With all I ’ve got , all I am . Offering her a divorce has nothing to do with you . I ’m doing it because she deserves to finally be free and independent , but if my choice leads her back to you … then you ’d better make sure you love her more than I do . Treat her better , love her harder , be the man I could never be . All those things I can give her that you ca n’t ? That ’s just money . I ’ll give her enough , so that wo n’t matter . ”

128182	128245	128165	128165	Grandma	34	“ I ’m just here to tell you that I ’ll support you no matter what . I learned my lesson with Ares and Luca , and I wo n’t make the same mistakes with you . If this is what you want , then I ’ll stand by your decision . The only thing I ’ll ask for is your forgiveness . ”
128257	128270	128246	128246	I	0	“ There ’s nothing to forgive , Grandma . Nothing at all . ”
128439	128444	128445	128445	he	33	“ Can we talk ? ”

128627	128762	128624	128624	Dion	33	“ It was unfair for me to say you deserve a choice without actually giving you one , Faye . Throughout our entire marriage , you ’ve been trying to make the best of this situation . We can tell ourselves whatever we ’d like , but ultimately , neither of us ever had a choice . The cottage ? I see it for what it is . It was the manifestation of your need for independence , and a fail - safe that you never should ’ve needed . I do n’t fault you for it , baby , nor do I blame you .

It drove your father mad with jealousy , because he had a pocket watch with my photo in it while I often wore a locket with my best friend ’s photo in it instead . ”
138267	138305	138260	138260	her	1870	“ Give my locket to Faye . It ’s the only thing I can give her , and I know she ’d love it the way I did . You ’ll find it in my jewelry box . ”
138400	138403	138404	138404	she	1870	“ Dion , ”
138443	138448	138449	138449	I	0	“ Are you ready ? ”
138463	138475	138449	138449	I	0	“ I am , but you ’re not . Not yet . ”
138510	138513	138499	138499	her	1870	“ How ? ”
138529	138566	138567	138567	She	1870	“ This one is n’t your mom ’s , unfortunately . I ’m sorry , Faye . I tried , but I could n’t find hers . The one around your neck was my mother ’s . ”
138581	138588	138589	138589	she	1870	“ It was your mother ’s ? ”
138596	138609	138589	138589	she	1870	“ It ’s one half of a friendship necklace . Open it . ”
138648	138657	138658	138658	she	1870	“ Mom had a similar photo in hers , ”
138669	138695	138658	138658	she	1870	“ Thank you , Dion . I … I do n’t know what to say . Is it really okay for me to have this ? ”
138699	138772	138773	138773	She	1879	“ I checked with all of my siblings , and they all agreed that it should be yours , just as they all agreed on me proposing with Mom ’s engagement ring . Neither of us can undo the past , Faye , but we can work together toward a better future while honoring our past . It felt right to have a part of both of our moms with us tonight . ”
138793	138798	138799	138799	she	1879	“ I love you , ”
138819	138824	138809	138809	she	1879	“ Are you ready ? ”
138874	138878	138879	138879	I	0	“ In hindsight , ”
138890	138901	138879	138879	I	0	“ I do n’t think I ’m ready at all . ”
138913	138965	138902	138902	Faye	33	“ I always feel the same way too , but it ’s better today , because I ’ve got you with me . Just think of all the money we raised with tonight ’s benefit concert , and how happy your family will be to see you on stage with me . ”
138991	139000	139001	139001	I	0	“ I ’ll do it , for you , ”
139004	139008	139001	139001	I	0	“ For us . ”
