6137	6148	6134	6134	Steven	69	“ Of course I want that . I love her . ”
6149	6164	6165	6165	I	0	“ You two already live together . Why do you need to get married ? ”
6168	6210	6165	6165	I	0	“ Because it ’s the next step in our relationship . I love her more than anything in this world and I want her to be my wife . Why is that so hard for the two of you to understand ? ”
6211	6231	6232	6232	I	0	“ Because it ’s not natural . Marriages do n’t last , dear friend , and you know it , ”
6235	6255	6232	6232	I	0	“ Besides , who wants to be tied down to the same pussy for the rest of their life ? ”
6256	6313	6165	6165	I	0	“ I do , and you know why ? Because for the hundredth time , I love her , and I ca n’t imagine my life without her . But the two of you would n’t know anything about that because all you care about is getting drunk and fucking a different woman every damn night . ”
6314	6335	6336	6336	I	0	“ And ? What ’s wrong with that ? You were one of us once . Do n’t forget that ! ”
6341	6346	6347	6347	Steven	69	“ Yeah , bro , ”
6350	6360	6347	6347	Steven	69	“ You were just as bad as we were . ”
6361	6392	6393	6393	He	69	“ Yeah , the key word being ‘ was . ’ But all that changed when I met Lindsey . Nah , forget it . You two will never understand . ”
6398	6414	6395	6395	his	69	“ I thought you ’d be happy for me . You ’re my best friends . ”
6415	6424	6425	6425	I	0	“ Look , man , I ’m sorry , ”
6428	6460	6395	6395	his	69	“ We are happy for you . We know you ’re happy with Lindsey and she ’s a great girl . We just do n’t want to see you get hurt . ”
6461	6478	6395	6395	his	69	“ I ’m not going to get hurt . I love her and she loves me . ”
6479	6485	6486	6486	Steven	69	“ Love fades , bro , ”
6497	6531	6532	6532	Alex	55	“ Not ours . I ’m asking her to marry me tonight . In fact , I ’m going to head back to shore . I want to make sure everything is perfect , ”

6564	6571	6572	6572	I	0	“ He ’s making a mistake , ”
6582	6586	6587	6587	Steven	69	“ No shit , ”
6598	6650	6590	6590	he	69	“ Why the hell would anyone want to commit to one single person for the rest of their life ? Everyone knows it wo n’t last . They just try to convince themselves that it will for some kind of temporary happiness . My father is the perfect example of that . ”
6651	6659	6662	6662	his	69	“ I do n’t know , bro . ”
6665	6675	6662	6662	his	69	“ Obviously , Lindsey put a spell on him . ”
6676	6680	6681	6681	I	0	“ I agree . ”
6687	6713	6681	6681	I	0	“ No woman will ever do that to me . I do n’t and will never give anyone that kind of power . Fuck no . ”
6714	6722	6723	6723	He	69	“ Yeah , bro ! Fuck no ! ”
6733	6742	6743	6743	I	0	“ I need to get laid and drunk , ”
6752	6758	6743	6743	I	0	“ Me too , man . ”
6759	6767	6768	6768	I	0	“ Shall we hit the Skybar tonight ? ”
6774	6797	6768	6768	I	0	“ God , I love the women at the Skybar . I ’m going to go home and take a nap first . ”
6798	6813	6814	6814	I	0	“ Sweet dreams , bro . I ’ll pick you up around eight o’clock , ”

7164	7193	7136	7136	he	289	“ It was good . Thanks . You said to call you if I needed a cab . Well , I need a cab . Are you available ? ”
7194	7209	7136	7136	he	289	“ I ’m just dropping off someone now . Are you at the motel ? ”

7285	7302	7282	7282	He	291	“ Well , I need to buy a car . Are the dealerships open on Saturdays ? ”
7303	7337	7351	7351	his	291	“ Yep . They ’re open until two o’clock , so you have plenty of time . There ’s a used car dealership not too far from here . Wanna check it out ? ”

7380	7386	7387	7387	I	0	“ Is that your family ? ”
7396	7401	7390	7390	I	0	“ They sure are . ”
7406	7423	7402	7402	He	291	“ That ’s my wife Nadia and our boys , Samuel , Jacob , and Luke . ”
7424	7430	7431	7431	I	0	“ Names from the Bible . ”
7434	7474	7431	7431	I	0	“ Yes . That ’s right . They are my world . Samuel is ten , Jacob is eight , and Luke is four . We planned on stopping after Jacob , but God had other plans for us . ”
7475	7480	7402	7402	He	291	“ They ’re beautiful . ”
7481	7494	7495	7495	he	295	“ Thanks . What about you ? Do you have any family ? ”
7498	7515	7495	7495	he	295	“ Not really . I have a mom back in Indiana . That ’s about it . ”

7597	7605	7606	7606	He	295	“ Why do you drive a cab ? ”
7620	7673	7606	7606	He	295	“ I drive a cab because it ’s in my blood . It ’s my company . My father handed it over to me when he retired . Plus , I love people . Everyone has a different story to tell , but in the end , we ’re all the same . ”
7674	7677	7678	7678	I	0	“ Nice . ”
7699	7703	7681	7681	He	295	“ Hello there . ”

7807	7852	7853	7853	He	301	“ This here is a 2010 Focus . It ’s the cheapest car I have on the lot and probably one of the most reliable . It has a hundred and eight thousand miles on it . But do n’t let that scare you . ”
7859	7876	7856	7856	his	301	“ Under the hood is all pretty much new parts . It runs like a charm . ”

I will text you the address to the office building you ’ll be working at . The job will only be available for about eight weeks .

8861	8896	8671	8671	she	319	“ All of our other temps who would be perfect as well are already placed elsewhere , so we are kind of in a pickle and we ca n’t afford to upset our client . ”

10806	10823	10824	10824	She	63	“ Stay away from her and I ’m sure she ’ll last the whole eight weeks . ”
10833	10844	10827	10827	Steven	69	“ Do n’t you have work to do , Lexi ? ”
10845	10853	10766	10766	her	63	“ Yes . Actually , I do . ”
10854	10877	10878	10878	I	0	“ Great , now what am I supposed to do ? There ’s no way in hell I ’m waiting eight weeks , ”
10886	10894	10895	10895	He	69	“ I do n’t know , bro . ”
10898	10926	10895	10895	He	69	“ Good luck with that one . By the way , I finished the Lexington program . Take a double look and let me know your thoughts . ”
10927	10935	10884	10884	Steven	69	“ I will . Thanks , Steven . ”

11144	11154	11155	11155	he	46	“ But , anyway , is he in there ? ”
11165	11176	11158	11158	he	46	“ No . He ’s in a meeting right now . ”
11177	11217	11218	11218	My	0	“ Hmm . Okay . I ’ll have to catch him later . I wanted to ask you if you would like to have dinner with me tonight . I would like to personally welcome you to Calloway Tech . ”
11229	11238	11222	11222	I	0	“ No thank you . I have plans . ”
11252	11275	11248	11248	he	46	“ Oh . Of course you do . A beautiful woman such as yourself certainly would n’t be sitting home all alone . ”
11285	11298	11278	11278	him	46	“ I ’m sure you and your boyfriend already have dinner plans . ”
11332	11335	11336	11336	I	0	“ No . ”
11341	11345	11338	11338	my	0	“ No what ? ”
11346	11357	11324	11324	he	46	“ My boyfriend and I do n’t have dinner plans . ”
11358	11370	11338	11338	my	0	“ Well , then you must have other plans with him . ”
11371	11374	11375	11375	I	0	“ No . ”
11378	11390	11375	11375	I	0	“ No , you do n’t have any plans with him ? ”
11391	11410	11338	11338	my	0	“ No . I have plans with myself . I do n’t have a boyfriend , Mr. Calloway . ”
11411	11436	11338	11338	my	0	“ I see . Well , I can honestly say that I ’m shocked . You ’re too beautiful not to be seeing someone . ”
11437	11448	11375	11375	I	0	“ Thank you for the compliment . I appreciate it . ”
11449	11454	11458	11458	his	360	“ You ’re welcome . ”
11466	11486	11487	11487	He	360	“ By the way , just call me Chase . Mr. Calloway reminds me too much of my father . ”
11514	11522	11508	11508	his	270	“ What are you doing , Chase ? ”
11523	11534	11500	11501	his father	270	“ Actually , Dad , I was looking for you . ”
11535	11546	11547	11547	he	270	“ I ’m here , so come into my office , ”
11550	11556	11547	11547	he	270	“ We ’ll talk soon . ”
11787	11803	11781	11781	he	46	“ Kinsley , can you come in here , please , and shut the door ? ”
11808	11814	11781	11781	he	46	“ Yes , Mr. Calloway ? ”
11815	11821	11822	11822	He	68	“ Have a seat please . ”
11830	11841	11822	11822	He	68	“ I know my son can come on pretty strong . ”
11842	11857	11781	11781	he	46	“ It ’s fine , Mr. Calloway . I ’m not bothered by it . ”
11858	11893	11781	11781	he	46	“ Listen , you seem like a really sweet girl and I do n’t want to see you get hurt . So , it would be in your best interest to not entertain Chase . ”
11894	11900	11822	11822	He	68	“ What do you mean ? ”
11901	11920	11781	11781	he	46	“ Do n’t go out with him , and for god sakes , do n’t sleep with him . ”
11932	11943	11921	11921	I	0	“ I ’m assuming he does this thing quite often . ”
11944	11952	11822	11822	He	68	“ More than you want to know . ”
11953	11989	11822	11822	He	68	“ Thank you for the warning , Mr. Calloway , but you do n’t have to worry . I ’m so anti - men , I did n’t even give your son a second look . ”

12001	12010	12011	12011	I	0	“ No . I ’m not a lesbian . ”
12014	12068	12011	12011	I	0	“ Let ’s just say that I moved here to reinvent myself and to start my life over . I ’m not going to let any man distract me from that . I already made that mistake once and it will be a cold day in hell before I let it happen again . ”
12081	12111	12072	12072	his	373	“ I get the impression you ’re a very independent and strong woman . Good for you . May I ask why you ’re working for a temp agency ? ”
12112	12151	12072	12072	his	373	“ I just moved here three days ago from Indiana . It was a kind of a spur of the moment move , and the agency called me quickly , so I had to take it for now . ”
12152	12177	12072	12072	his	373	“ Well , you have a good head on your shoulders , and I ’m lucky the agency sent you over to Calloway Tech . ”
12178	12185	12072	12072	his	373	“ Thank you , Mr. Calloway . ”
12186	12219	12220	12220	He	374	“ You ’re welcome , Kinsley . Can you please call the florist and send my fiancée , Penelope , a dozen red roses ? We had a little argument this morning . ”
12223	12233	12220	12220	He	374	“ Of course . I ’ll do it now . ”
12312	12318	12319	12319	She	380	“ You must be Kinsley . ”
12327	12335	12322	12322	she	380	“ And you must be Mrs. Graham . ”
12345	12359	12340	12340	I	0	“ Follow me , dear , and I ’ll show you the apartment . ”
12528	12539	12540	12541	Mrs. Graham	87	“ So , Kinsley , where are you living now ? ”
12549	12553	12540	12541	Mrs. Graham	87	“ A motel . ”
12554	12559	12560	12560	She	387	“ Oh , dear . ”
12567	12595	12560	12560	She	387	“ I just moved to Los Angeles on Friday . It was an unexpected kind of move . I came out here to start my life over . ”
12596	12605	12606	12606	she	387	“ Are you running from someone or something ? ”
12609	12647	12606	12606	she	387	“ Sort of . This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid . I would have been here a couple of years ago , but then I met my ex - boyfriend Henry . ”
12648	12661	12662	12662	She	387	“ Ah . So , you pushed it all aside for him . ”
12665	12696	12662	12662	She	387	“ Pretty much . I went over to his apartment Friday morning to surprise him for his birthday and I found him in bed with my best friend , Krista . ”
12697	12707	12708	12708	She	387	“ Oh , dear . I ’m so sorry . ”
12748	12785	12740	12740	she	387	“ Thank you , but that was the push I needed to finally leave Indiana and move here . I ’ve been saving every dime I ’ve made since I was sixteen years old for this . ”
12786	12793	12733	12733	she	387	“ Are you looking for work ? ”
12794	12837	12733	12733	she	387	“ I have a job . Today was my first day . I ’m a temp for Dean Calloway at Calloway Tech . I ’ll be working there for at least eight weeks . But I ’m still looking for something permanent . ”
12838	12848	12849	12849	she	387	“ So what do you think about the apartment ? ”
12852	12870	12849	12849	she	387	“ I love it . I think it ’s absolutely perfect . How much for the rent ? ”
12871	12877	12878	12878	she	387	“ What is your budget ? ”
12881	12899	12849	12849	she	387	“ I really can only afford a thousand dollars a month until I start making more money . ”
12900	12905	12906	12906	She	387	“ What a coincidence . ”
12909	12928	12906	12906	She	387	“ That ’s exactly what the rent is . But you are responsible for all utilities except water . ”
12929	12947	12849	12849	she	387	“ Are you serious ? There ’s no way this apartment is a thousand dollars a month . ”
12948	12966	12849	12849	she	387	“ It is for you , dear , and if you want it , it ’s yours . ”
12967	12984	12849	12849	she	387	“ Mrs. Graham . I do n’t know what to say . Thank you so much . ”
12985	13070	13071	13071	She	395	“ I ’m very selective about whom I rent my apartments to . I ’ve already turned down four people for this place because I felt they were n’t the right fit . But you , you ’re the right fit . My husband passed away a couple of years ago and left me set for the rest of my life . So , I ’m not worried about the money . You need a nice place to live and I have one available . ”
13074	13078	13071	13071	She	395	“ Thank you . ”
13088	13183	13184	13184	She	395	“ You ’re welcome . You can move in tomorrow or even tonight . I ’ll just need you to sign the lease and the keys are yours . The kitchen is fully stocked with dishes , glasses , silverware , bakeware , and pots and pans . There are some cleaning products under the cabinet , but not many . The bathroom is fully stocked with towels and washcloths , and there are two sets of extra sheets in the linen closet . All you have to do is bring in your clothes . ”
13348	13357	13358	13358	I	0	“ L.A. ’s sexiest and most eligible bachelor ? ”
13467	13484	13485	13485	she	63	“ Okay , Chase . What is so important that I had to run over here ? ”
13492	13511	13485	13485	she	63	“ I need to talk to you about something . Can I get you a glass of wine ? ”
13512	13515	13516	13516	she	63	“ Sure , ”
13525	13546	13519	13519	she	63	“ Why could n’t you talk to me about it at the office ? Traffic was a bitch getting here . ”
13547	13559	13560	13560	I	0	“ I could n’t run the risk of someone overhearing us . ”
13585	13595	13596	13596	she	63	“ This sounds serious . Are you in trouble ? ”
13601	13609	13596	13596	she	63	“ No . This is about Kinsley . ”
13610	13616	13617	13617	she	63	“ Your dad ’s temp ? ”
13620	13623	13617	13617	she	63	“ Yes . ”
13624	13629	13596	13596	she	63	“ What about her ? ”
13630	13640	13641	13641	I	0	“ She seems to not be affected by me . ”
13655	13677	13646	13646	Lexi	63	“ You mean she ’s not falling to her knees to suck your dick like every other woman in the world ? ”
13678	13715	13596	13596	she	63	“ That was uncalled for , Lexi . But yes , something like that . I asked her to go to dinner with me tonight so I could welcome her to Calloway Tech and she declined . ”
13728	13743	13718	13718	her	63	“ Oh my God . Someone actually said no to the great Chase Calloway ? ”
13744	13756	13596	13596	she	63	“ I know , right ? She said she had plans . ”
13757	13765	13596	13596	she	63	“ So what ? Maybe she did . ”
13766	13769	13770	13770	I	0	“ Lexi . ”
13775	13786	13770	13770	I	0	“ Women cancel their plans to go out with me . ”
13787	13794	13795	13795	She	63	“ Maybe she ’s a lesbian . ”
13798	13809	13810	13810	I	0	“ That is what I need you to find out . ”
13815	13818	13810	13810	I	0	“ What ? ”
13822	13842	13819	13819	She	63	“ I need you to befriend her and find out if she ’s into men or women or both . ”
13847	13861	13843	13843	My	0	“ If she ’s bisexual , then I ’d still have a chance . ”
13862	13891	13843	13843	My	0	“ So , let me get this straight . You want me to become friends with her just so you can find out if she ’s a lesbian ? ”
13892	13916	13843	13843	My	0	“ Yes . As my secretary / personal assistant / sister - like friend , I ’ve just assigned you a new task . ”
13917	13933	13934	13934	She	414	“ Come on , Chase . I ’m not going to deceive the smart girl . ”
13937	13954	13934	13934	She	414	“ But I could get to know her as a friend . She seems really nice . ”
13955	13966	13967	13967	I	0	“ Excellent . I knew I could count on you . ”
13972	13988	13967	13967	I	0	“ Did you ever stop to consider that maybe she ’s just not into you ? ”

19698	19703	19690	19690	I	0	“ Umm . Sure . ”
19727	19731	19732	19732	she	59	“ What now ? ”
19743	19767	19732	19732	she	59	“ I just wanted to give you a heads up about Jarrod . He just got out of a three - year relationship . ”
19768	19773	19708	19708	I	0	“ Okay ? And ? ”
19774	19800	19708	19708	I	0	“ I just noticed you getting chummy with him and I thought you should know . He ’s not in a good place right now . ”
19801	19828	19732	19732	she	59	“ I did n’t know I could n’t talk to someone who just got out of a relationship . Plus , he seemed fine to me . ”
19829	19863	19708	19708	I	0	“ I was n’t saying that . I just saw the way he was looking at you and I thought you should know in case you were thinking about going out with him . ”
19864	19908	19708	19708	I	0	“ He did n’t ask me out , Chase . We were just having a conversation . You know , like normal people do ? And even if he did ask me out and I went , what business is it of yours ? ”
19909	19924	19929	19929	she	500	“ It ’s totally my business since you refuse to go out with me . ”
19938	19953	19929	19929	she	500	“ I wo n’t go out with you because you ’re a walking STD . ”
19957	19999	19954	19954	She	500	“ I most certainly am not . I ’m totally offended by that comment . I ’ll have you know that I take protection very seriously . In fact , it ’s probably the most serious thing I take in life . ”
20000	20005	19929	19929	she	500	“ Good to know . ”
20012	20028	19929	19929	she	500	“ Now that we ’ve cleared that up , have dinner with me tomorrow night . ”
20029	20032	19954	19954	She	500	“ No . ”
20033	20053	19954	19954	She	500	“ Come on , Kinsley . You ’re killing me here . I want to get to know you . ”
20054	20057	20058	20058	She	500	“ Why ? ”
20063	20094	20058	20058	She	500	“ To be honest , I do n’t know . I just do , and you should be flattered because I generally could care less about getting to know someone . ”
20108	20120	20121	20121	she	500	“ Mr. Calloway . You ’re right . I am flattered , ”
20135	20163	20128	20128	I	0	“ Fine . I ’m not asking you again . But I will say that you missed out on one of the best times of your life . ”
20164	20169	20170	20170	She	500	“ I ’ll live . ”
20173	20181	20182	20182	I	0	“ Enjoy the party , Miss Davis , ”
20351	20364	20345	20345	I	0	“ Hey , Lexi , can I ask you something about Chase ? ”
20365	20375	20325	20325	he	46	“ Sure . What do you want to know ? ”
20376	20407	20325	20325	he	46	“ He told me that I should be flattered that he wants to get to know me because he generally could care less about getting to know someone . Why ? ”
20408	20411	20412	20412	Her	507	“ Well . ”
20416	20492	20412	20412	Her	507	“ He loves women for what they can give him and what they can give him is sex . That ’s all he cares about . God , I feel awful for talking about him like that because he truly is an amazing guy and friend . He ’d give you the shirt off his back if you needed it . He just does n’t care to get to know the women he sleeps with . ”
20493	20513	20325	20325	he	46	“ So you ’re saying that he pretty much just has meaningless sex with them and that ’s it ? ”
20514	20533	20325	20325	he	46	“ Yes . To Chase , sex is just sex . It has no emotional meaning or attachment . ”
20534	20546	20547	20547	I	0	“ When was the last time he was in a relationship ? ”
20553	20562	20547	20547	I	0	“ He ’s never been in a relationship . ”
20563	20566	20567	20567	I	0	“ What ? ”
20570	20575	20567	20567	I	0	“ That ’s impossible . ”
20576	20614	20547	20547	I	0	“ Chase has a lot of issues stemming from his childhood . He does n’t believe in relationships and sometimes he makes it difficult for us who are in them because he loves to voice his opinion . ”
20615	20619	20620	20620	I	0	“ I see . ”
20634	20643	20620	20620	I	0	“ I can kind of see his point . ”
20648	20670	20644	20644	I	0	“ After what I witnessed with my ex , it ’ll be a long time before I trust another man again . ”
20671	20680	20681	20681	She	510	“ You never did tell me what happened . ”
20689	20725	20681	20681	She	510	“ We dated for a little over a year . He was the reason why I did n’t move out here sooner . I walked in on him and my best friend in bed together . ”
20726	20733	20734	20734	She	510	“ Oh . I ’m sorry . ”
20742	20769	20736	20736	her	510	“ Do n’t be . He told me that it meant nothing and now I realize that it was the best thing that could have happened . ”
20770	20799	20681	20681	She	510	“ I can totally understand why you ’re staying away from guys , and I do n’t blame you one bit . Trusting someone after that is hard . ”
20800	20806	20807	20807	I	0	“ Yeah , it is . ”
20814	20832	20681	20681	She	510	“ And I ’ll never make the mistake of putting my life on hold for someone else . ”
20875	20880	20881	20881	I	0	“ It ’s beautiful , ”
20884	20900	20881	20881	I	0	“ It sure is . This is something I will never get tired of seeing . ”
20921	20940	20901	20901	I	0	“ Chase , I ’m sorry for calling you a walking STD . I did n’t mean it . ”
20941	20955	20976	20976	he	46	“ Nah . It ’s fine . You do n’t have to apologize . ”
20956	20967	20976	20976	he	46	“ I do , and again , I ’m sorry . ”
20968	20972	20973	20973	He	46	“ Apology accepted . ”
20982	20992	20976	20976	he	46	“ Are you liking it in California so far ? ”
20993	21001	21002	21002	I	0	“ Actually , I ’m loving it . ”
21005	21024	21002	21002	I	0	“ Chase ! We need one more person on our team for volleyball . Come play with us ! ”
21035	21044	21045	21045	he	46	“ I ’ll be right there , darling , ”
21049	21054	21045	21045	he	46	“ They need me . ”
21055	21063	21002	21002	I	0	“ Then you better not disappoint them . ”
21064	21080	21045	21045	he	46	“ Do you want to play ? I ’m sure we could squeeze you in . ”
21081	21084	21085	21085	I	0	“ Nah . ”
21090	21095	21085	21085	I	0	“ You go ahead . ”
21096	21104	21045	21045	he	46	“ Okay . We ’ll talk later ? ”
21105	21110	21111	21111	I	0	“ Yeah . Later . ”
21254	21262	21263	21263	Chase	46	“ Look at you , Kinsley Davis . ”
21273	21284	21266	21266	he	46	“ I did n’t think small town girls did shots . ”
21285	21290	21291	21291	I	0	“ This one does . ”
21296	21317	21318	21318	He	46	“ Well , good for you , letting your wild side out . I ’ll have what she ’s having . ”
21469	21476	21477	21477	Chase	46	“ Ah . You ’re awake . ”
21485	21492	21493	21493	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? ”
21505	21518	21496	21496	I	0	“ I brought you home last night . Do n’t you remember ? ”
21519	21528	21480	21480	he	46	“ No . I do n’t remember anything . ”
21529	21548	21549	21549	He	46	“ Of course you do n’t . You were too drunk . Good job , by the way . ”
21552	21556	21549	21549	He	46	“ For what ? ”
21557	21577	21578	21578	I	0	“ For letting your party girl out . Stay right where you are . I ’ll be right back . ”
21617	21621	21606	21606	Chase	46	“ Drink up . ”
21622	21628	21629	21629	I	0	“ You drove me home ? ”
21639	21647	21629	21629	I	0	“ Yes , and you ’re welcome . ”
21648	21660	21606	21606	Chase	46	“ How ? You drank just as much as I did . ”
21661	21675	21676	21676	He	46	“ Alcohol and I have an understanding . We ’re like best friends . ”
21679	21688	21676	21676	He	46	“ How did you know where I lived ? ”
21689	21736	21606	21606	Chase	46	“ I wish I could say I got your address from your driver ’s license , but you do n’t have a California license yet . Which , by the way , you better do quickly . So I checked your google maps on your phone . ”
21737	21752	21606	21606	Chase	46	“ Thank you . I appreciate it , but why are you still here ? ”
21753	21797	21606	21606	Chase	46	“ By time I got you in your apartment , held your hair while you vomited in the toilet , and then put you to bed , I was too tired to drive home , so I just passed out on your couch . ”
21798	21806	21807	21807	I	0	“ Thank you for bringing me home . ”
21822	21827	21807	21807	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . ”
21828	21834	21606	21606	Chase	46	“ What about my car ? ”
21835	21863	21606	21606	Chase	46	“ I had one of the guys , who was a designated driver , follow me here with it . Your keys are on the kitchen table . ”
21864	21878	21807	21807	I	0	“ There is n’t anything else I should know about , is there ? ”
21879	21898	21899	21899	He	528	“ Like what ? Oh right . You ’re asking if we had sex , are n’t you ? ”
21911	21929	21905	21905	I	0	“ No . We did n’t . I ’d prefer you to be sober when we do . ”
21930	21938	21807	21807	I	0	“ We are n’t ever having sex . ”
21939	21946	21947	21947	He	528	“ Never say never , darling . ”
21950	22003	21947	21947	He	528	“ Anyway , I have to go . If you need anything , I ’ve programmed my cell into your phone . Have a good day , Kinsley . By the way , you do n’t have any contacts in your phone but three people . I found that a little strange . ”
22004	22011	21807	21807	I	0	“ You went through my phone ? ”
22012	22029	22056	22056	he	529	“ No . I noticed it when I put my number in . Who ’s Reece ? ”
22030	22035	22036	22036	I	0	“ My cab driver , ”
22042	22052	22053	22053	He	529	“ You are a strange girl , Miss Davis . ”
22210	22213	22199	22199	Delilah	89	“ Chase , ”
22224	22231	22199	22199	Delilah	89	“ What are you doing here ? ”
22232	22253	22254	22254	He	532	“ I figured since you wo n’t go out to dinner with me , I ’d bring dinner to you . ”
22265	22297	22257	22257	he	532	“ Plus , I was in your refrigerator this morning and I noticed you did n’t have any food . You really need to go shopping . May I come in ? ”
22298	22312	22257	22257	he	532	“ Yeah . Sure . You did n’t have to bring me dinner . ”
22313	22334	22335	22335	He	532	“ I know I did n’t , but I figured you had n’t eaten all day because of your hangover . ”
22349	22401	22335	22335	He	532	“ I brought a variety of food since I was n’t really sure what you liked . We have two different kinds of salads , grilled chicken , salmon , seasoned rice , mashed potatoes , sweet potatoes , green beans , and asparagus . Oh , and a pasta dish . ”
22402	22410	22411	22411	I	0	“ Did you order the whole menu ? ”
22414	22417	22418	22418	He	532	“ Almost . ”
22445	22458	22459	22459	He	532	“ I do n’t suppose you want any alcohol , do you ? ”
22480	22489	22462	22462	he	532	“ No . I ’ll stick with water . ”
22508	22534	22535	22535	I	0	“ This all looks and smells really good , but if you ’re expecting to get sex out of it , you can forget it . ”
22538	22589	22535	22535	I	0	“ Kinsley , darling , I did n’t bring you dinner expecting to get sex . Actually , I had plans tonight , but they got cancelled , and believe it or not , I had nothing else to do . Plus , I knew you would n’t have plans . ”
22590	22594	22595	22595	My	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
22599	22613	22595	22595	My	0	“ Are you insinuating that I do n’t do anything or go anywhere ? ”

23903	23938	23897	23897	her	554	“ All I said was that leaving a note was the coward ’s way out and it was disrespectful . Then I asked her if she made a habit of leaving notes and running . ”
23952	23961	23949	23949	her	554	“ It was a trigger response , Lexi . ”
23962	23972	23939	23939	She	554	“ You do n’t know her circumstances , Chase . ”
23973	23979	23980	23980	I	0	“ It does n’t matter . ”
23999	24029	23995	23995	Steven	69	“ Hey , I just saw Kinsley out there and she said if I saw you to tell you that your dad wants to see you in his office . ”

24095	24107	24092	24092	Steven	69	“ She was not , and if you say that again , ”
24113	24119	24108	24108	I	0	“ I ’m firing you ! ”
24171	24178	24179	24179	I	0	“ He wanted to see me ? ”
24201	24214	24215	24215	she	63	“ Yes . But he ’s on a phone call right now , ”
24270	24275	24276	24276	He	1434	“ Really , son ? ”
24279	24288	24289	24289	He	1434	“ At least cover the damn thing up . ”

24328	24356	24325	24325	I	0	“ Listen , Chase . You ’re thirty years old . Have you considered that maybe it ’s time to find a nice girl and settle down ? ”
24364	24377	24357	24357	I	0	“ Me , settle down ? Right . Never happening , Dad . ”
24378	24390	24291	24291	his	1434	“ This party life of yours ca n’t go on forever . ”
24391	24395	24291	24291	his	1434	“ Why not ? ”
24396	24409	24357	24357	I	0	“ Because , son , it ’s not the way to live . ”
24410	24419	24422	24422	my	0	“ But marrying and divorcing four times is ? ”
24427	24451	24420	24420	I	0	“ And now you ’re marrying bridezilla for the fifth time ? You do know she ’s only after your money , right ? ”
24452	24529	24552	24552	his	558	“ I made her sign a prenuptial agreement and it ’s ironclad . If she was only in it for the money , she would n’t have signed it and called off the wedding . But she did n’t . She was more than happy to sign it . You never gave her a chance , Chase . You hated her right off the bat , and I do n’t understand why . I love her . ”
24530	24537	24538	24538	I	0	“ Just like you loved Mom ? ”
24543	24549	24550	24550	He	558	“ I loved your mother . ”
24557	24582	24552	24552	his	558	“ And I ’m not discussing this anymore . Get your fucking life together and act like a Calloway or there will be consequences . ”
24583	24586	24587	24587	I	0	“ Consequences ? ”
24592	24626	24627	24627	I	0	“ If it were n’t for me , Calloway Tech would n’t be where it ’s at today ; a company worth twenty - billion - dollars . Do n’t you forget that ! ”
24877	24890	24891	24891	I	0	“ Oh , come on . Do n’t do this to me , ”
24912	24918	24919	24919	Chase	69	“ What are you doing ? ”
24926	24933	24934	24934	He	69	“ My car wo n’t start . ”
24949	24957	24958	24958	he	69	“ What exactly are you looking for ? ”
24961	24981	24958	24958	he	69	“ I think it ’s the starter that ’s bad . I ’m just checking for any loose connections . ”
24982	24993	25010	25010	him	69	“ And you know a thing or two about cars ? ”
24994	25005	25006	25006	I	0	“ Yes . A little bit . Do n’t you ? ”
25012	25021	25006	25006	I	0	“ No . I know nothing about them . ”
25022	25028	25010	25010	him	69	“ I ’m not surprised . ”
25029	25037	25038	25038	he	69	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
25041	25058	25038	25038	he	69	“ Nothing . Just go . I ’m going to have to call a tow truck , ”
25072	25092	25064	25064	I	0	“ I know a guy . Let me make a call , and then I ’ll drive you home . ”
25093	25100	25059	25059	I	0	“ I can call an Uber . ”
25101	25109	25110	25110	He	69	“ You ’re not calling an Uber . ”
25113	25122	25110	25110	He	69	“ I ’m sure you have plans tonight . ”
25132	25140	25123	25123	I	0	“ Maybe round two from last night . ”
25141	25157	25158	25158	He	69	“ Do n’t worry about my plans . I ’m not leaving you here alone . ”
25177	25207	25171	25171	he	69	“ Carl is on his way . He ’ll be here in about twenty minutes and tow it to his shop , which is n’t too far from here . ”
25208	25211	25171	25171	he	69	“ Thanks . ”
25216	25225	25226	25226	he	69	“ Why are you here this late anyway ? ”
25229	25253	25226	25226	he	69	“ Your dad gave me a proposal at the last minute and it needed to be typed up for his meeting tomorrow morning . ”
25254	25259	25260	25260	He	69	“ Sounds like him . ”
25317	25393	25315	25315	Henry	57	“ Me and Henry were together for a little over a year . It was his birthday and I wanted to surprise him . So , I took the day off work , stopped at his favorite bakery in the morning , went to his apartment , and found him in bed with my best friend , Krista . They claimed they only slept together twice , but I knew it was more than that . ”
25394	25399	25400	25400	Chase	69	“ I ’m sorry , ”
25404	25413	25400	25400	Chase	69	“ That must have been quite a shock . ”
25414	25460	25315	25315	Henry	57	“ I left his apartment , went home , packed what I could , and hopped on a plane here . I only stayed in Indiana because of him . A year of my life wasted when I could have already been here and established . ”
25488	25500	25478	25478	He	95	“ A girl who knows about cars . I like that . ”
25510	25514	25515	25515	Chase	69	“ Climb in , ”
25526	25529	25530	25530	He	69	“ Thanks . ”
25568	25578	25579	25579	I	0	“ This is n’t the way to my apartment , ”
25582	25593	25579	25579	I	0	“ I know . We ’re making a stop first . ”
25600	25603	25594	25594	He	69	“ Where ? ”
25604	25609	25610	25610	He	69	“ You ’ll see . ”
25627	25633	25634	25634	I	0	“ Why are we here ? ”
25637	25663	25664	25664	He	69	“ I ’m starving and I ’m sure you are too . So , before I take you home , we ’re going to eat . ”
25675	25687	25664	25664	He	69	“ You do n’t have to open the door for me , ”
25710	25716	25688	25688	I	0	“ I am a gentleman . ”
25717	25723	25724	25724	I	0	“ No you ’re not . ”
25735	25740	25741	25741	he	69	“ How dare you , ”
25772	25775	25776	25776	He	69	“ Impressed ? ”
25779	25783	25776	25776	He	69	“ Not really . ”
25808	25812	25799	25799	I	0	“ Chase Calloway . ”
25821	25830	25813	25818	A pretty blonde - haired waitress	583	“ Kara , darling . How are you ? ”
25831	25842	25843	25843	She	583	“ I ’m good . It ’s been a while . ”
25865	25879	25880	25880	Chase	46	“ It has . Maybe we should catch up over a drink sometime . ”
25883	25892	25880	25880	Chase	46	“ I ’d love that . Call me . ”
25908	25912	25913	25913	I	0	“ Excuse me , ”
25916	25936	25913	25913	I	0	“ I totally hate to interrupt this special moment between the two of you , but can we order ? ”
25937	25941	25942	25942	She	583	“ Oh sure . ”
25954	25963	25942	25942	She	583	“ What can I get you , sweetie ? ”
25964	25976	25977	25977	I	0	“ I ’ll have the sea scallops and the butternut squash , ”
25980	25987	25988	25988	She	583	“ And for you , handsome ? ”
25993	26013	25988	25988	She	583	“ I ’ll have the Chilean sea bass and mashed potatoes . Also bring us a bottle of Prosecco . ”
26014	26019	26020	26020	She	583	“ You got it . ”
26058	26069	26070	26070	he	46	“ Why did you tell me about your ex earlier ? ”
26073	26092	26070	26070	he	46	“ I do n’t know . You wanted to know why I left California in such a hurry . ”
26093	26149	26172	26172	Kara	97	“ Was he the only reason ? Because I find it a little strange that you ’d just skip town and move to a place where you do n’t know anyone at all or have a place to live or a job over a guy . I kind of find that being a little unstable . ”
26150	26171	26172	26172	Kara	97	“ He was the only reason why I stayed . And are n’t you the pot calling the kettle black . ”
26191	26197	26198	26198	Chase	46	“ Thank you , darling . ”
26207	26215	26216	26216	he	46	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
26226	26249	26219	26219	he	46	“ You ’ve slept with just about every woman in Los Angeles and god knows where else . Talk about being unstable . ”
26250	26289	26219	26219	he	46	“ No , sweetheart . That ’s not being unstable . I happen to enjoy sex with beautiful women . There ’s nothing wrong with that . It ’s called life . Maybe you should try it sometime . ”
26290	26310	26311	26311	I	0	“ You ’re right , Chase . It ’s not about being unstable . It ’s about being insecure . ”
26322	26325	26326	26326	he	46	“ Me , ”
26331	26349	26326	26326	he	46	“ insecure ? You ’re delusional , darling . I ’m the most secure person there is . ”
26350	26368	26316	26316	He	46	“ Keep telling yourself that . Because deep down , you use sex as a coping mechanism . ”
26369	26415	26416	26416	He	46	“ Okay . First of all , we ’re not talking about me . We ’re talking about you . I asked you the question , remember ? Plus , you do n’t know a damn thing about me to be making judgments like that . ”
26422	26435	26436	26436	I	0	“ And you do n’t know a damn thing about me either , ”
26483	26488	26492	26492	she	97	“ Enjoy your dinner . ”
26502	26507	26492	26492	she	97	“ I ’ll try , ”
26604	26611	26612	26612	I	0	“ You owe me an apology , ”

26631	26642	26626	26626	She	421	“ No , jerk ! You owe me an apology . ”
26654	26688	26689	26689	She	421	“ I do n’t owe you shit . I was nice enough to help you out with your car and treat you to this nice dinner and that ’s how you treat me ? ”
26712	26729	26689	26689	She	421	“ In two days , you have called me a coward , disrespectful , and unstable ! ”
26730	26737	26738	26745	the lady at the table next to us	600	“ Oh no he did n’t , ”
26752	26759	26760	26760	She	421	“ Oh , but he did . ”
26766	26771	26772	26773	The lady	601	“ Shame on you ! ”
26780	26794	26775	26775	her	601	“ If you were my son , you ’d get a good whooping . ”
26795	26805	26806	26806	I	0	“ Well then , thank god I ’m not , ”
26809	26829	26775	26775	her	601	“ Okay . Everyone needs to calm down . Kinsley , I ’m sorry for calling you those things . ”
26830	26836	26837	26837	She	421	“ No you ’re not . ”
26845	26860	26842	26842	I	0	“ Can we please just finish our dinner so I can take you home ? ”
26861	26864	26865	26865	she	421	“ Fine , ”
26916	26921	26922	26922	he	1277	“ Chase , Kinsley , ”
26938	26944	26922	26922	he	1277	“ Hi , Mr. Calloway . ”
26948	26953	26945	26945	Kinsley	59	“ Hey , Dad . ”
26954	26965	26966	26966	he	1277	“ So the two of you are having dinner together ? ”
26971	27019	26966	26966	he	1277	“ When I was leaving the office , I saw Kinsley in the parking garage and her car would n’t start . So , I called a tow truck and offered to drive her home and we stopped here to get something to eat on the way . ”
27020	27043	27072	27072	she	59	“ I see . Kinsley , this is my fiancée Penelope . Penelope , this is my temporary secretary , Kinsley Davis . ”
27044	27050	27054	27054	she	605	“ Nice to meet you . ”
27059	27068	27072	27072	she	59	“ It ’s nice to meet you too , ”
27080	27102	27072	27072	she	59	“ Well , then , we ’ll let you two finish your dinner . I ’ll see you both tomorrow morning . ”
27103	27109	27072	27072	she	59	“ See ya , Dad . ”
27123	27133	27134	27134	She	605	“ Do n’t forget about that drink , Chase . ”
27137	27144	27134	27134	She	605	“ I wo n’t , darling . ”
27162	27168	27169	27169	I	0	“ What ’s that for ? ”
27172	27178	27169	27169	I	0	“ My half of dinner . ”
27179	27189	27190	27190	I	0	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . I ’m paying , ”
27207	27232	27193	27193	I	0	“ I did n’t ask you to take me to dinner . Plus , I do n’t want you holding it over my head . ”
27237	27245	27233	27233	Her	59	“ Kinsley , come on . Please . ”
27255	27258	27259	27259	She	59	“ Fine . ”
27273	27283	27284	27284	I	0	“ Do n’t I even get a thank you ? ”
27395	27401	27402	27402	Lexi	63	“ Good morning , Chase . ”
27431	27447	27448	27448	Lexi	63	“ Okay , what ’s going on ? Who has your panties in a twist ? ”
27459	27483	27451	27451	she	63	“ Nothing is going on , and no one , as you so eloquently put it , has my panties in a twist . ”
27484	27497	27451	27451	she	63	“ I call bullshit . I ’ve known you forever , Chase . ”
27509	27515	27516	27516	I	0	“ Not now , Steven , ”
27527	27533	27534	27534	he	69	“ What ’s going on ? ”
27537	27567	27534	27534	he	69	“ Someone has Chase ’s panties in a bunch and he wo n’t tell me who or what happened to put him in such a foul mood this morning . ”
27568	27578	27579	27579	He	69	“ Oh . Is that so ? Do tell . ”
27607	27612	27594	27594	I	0	“ It ’s Kinsley . ”
27613	27618	27619	27619	Lexi	63	“ Now what happened ? ”
27626	27666	27619	27619	Lexi	63	“ When I was leaving last night , I saw her in the parking garage and her car would n’t start . I called a tow truck and on the way home , we stopped and grabbed some dinner . ”
27667	27672	27673	27673	Steven	69	“ Let me guess . ”
27676	27685	27673	27673	Steven	69	“ She refused to have sex with you . ”
27695	27746	27686	27686	I	0	“ No . Sex was n’t even on the table . She told me about her catching her ex and her best friend in bed and that ’s why she moved here so suddenly . I asked her if that was the only reason because it seemed a little unstable . ”
27747	27756	27673	27673	Steven	69	“ Oh , Chase . You did n’t . ”
27757	27763	27764	27764	Steven	69	“ You called her unstable ? ”
27767	27788	27764	27764	Steven	69	“ She told me that the only reason I have sex with so many women is because I ’m insecure . ”
27800	27820	27793	27793	I	0	“ When I debated with her about it , she told me I use sex as a coping mechanism . ”
27833	27860	27826	27826	I	0	“ Then I told her she owed me an apology and she voiced rather loudly that I owed her one , and she refused to apologize . ”
27861	27876	27877	27877	Steven	69	“ The two of you need to have sex and get it over with , ”
27880	27890	27891	27891	Lexi	63	“ I ’ve never seen you like this before , ”
27894	27919	27891	27891	Lexi	63	“ Kinsley is a strong and independent woman . You ’re not used to that . All the women you sleep with are airheads . ”
27920	27926	27927	27927	I	0	“ That is not true , ”
27930	27938	27939	27939	Steven	69	“ Yeah , bro . It is , ”
27942	27968	27939	27939	Steven	69	“ You do n’t let women get to you at all , so us having this conversation tells me that you ’re afraid of her . ”
27969	27975	27976	27976	I	0	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
27979	27990	27976	27976	I	0	“ Why the fuck would I be afraid of Kinsley ? ”
27991	28003	28004	28004	Lexi	63	“ Because you do n’t know what to do with her , ”
28007	28046	28004	28004	Lexi	63	“ You ’re not used to this kind of challenge . You snap your fingers and women drop to their knees for you . But with Kinsley , you snap your fingers and she runs the other way . ”
28047	28091	27976	27976	I	0	“ She does not , Lexi . Maybe she does n’t know what to do with me . After all , she ’s from a small town with probably no experience at all . Maybe that ’s why her boyfriend cheated on her . ”
28092	28103	28104	28104	Lexi	63	“ That ’s low , Chase . Even for you . ”
28109	28130	28131	28131	I	0	“ Yeah . Perhaps it was . I need to get to work and so do the both of you . ”
28270	28287	28265	28266	Mr. Calloway	68	“ Good morning , Kinsley . Can I see you in my office for a second ? ”
28288	28294	28303	28303	him	68	“ Sure , Mr. Calloway . ”
28308	28316	28317	28317	he	68	“ How was your dinner last night ? ”
28320	28325	28317	28317	he	68	“ It was fine . ”
28326	28336	28305	28305	his	68	“ And Chase made sure you got home safely ? ”
28337	28340	28341	28341	I	0	“ Yes . ”
28348	28354	28341	28341	I	0	“ And everything ’s okay ? ”
28355	28361	28305	28305	his	68	“ Yes , Mr. Calloway . ”
28362	28370	28371	28371	He	68	“ Okay then . You may go . ”
28396	28399	28393	28393	me	0	“ No ! ”
28408	28437	28400	28400	I	0	“ Things are not okay . Your son is an insufferable man . He ’s rude , arrogant , thinks he knows everything , and he ’s cocky . ”
28438	28444	28445	28445	He	68	“ I wo n’t disagree . ”
28448	28460	28445	28445	He	68	“ I take it you and Chase are n’t getting along ? ”
28461	28479	28400	28400	I	0	“ Getting along ? I ca n’t even stand to be in the same room with him . ”
28480	28499	28400	28400	I	0	“ Kinsley , I ’m sorry , but I have to ask . Did you two sleep together ? ”
28500	28507	28508	28508	He	68	“ No ! Of course not . ”
28521	28537	28508	28508	He	68	“ If you did n’t sleep together , then where is all this coming from ? ”
28538	28544	28400	28400	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
28545	28560	28400	28400	I	0	“ Usually this type of behavior and animosity comes after the sex with Chase . ”
28561	28580	28508	28508	He	68	“ I did not sleep with your son , Mr. Calloway . He ’s just a judgmental asshat . ”
28581	28586	28587	28587	He	68	“ I like that . ”
28595	28598	28590	28590	he	68	“ Asshat . ”
28599	28641	28508	28508	He	68	“ He told me that I was unstable , so I told him that he was insecure and that ’s why he sleeps around with anyone that has a vagina . I told him he uses sex as a coping mechanism . ”
28642	28651	28508	28508	He	68	“ And what did he say to that ? ”
28652	28669	28508	28508	He	68	“ He was n’t happy about it and reverted the conversation back to me being unstable . ”
28670	28689	28508	28508	He	68	“ You ’re far from unstable , Kinsley . Do n’t let my son ’s words upset you . ”
28690	28711	28508	28508	He	68	“ Trust me , I ’m not , and I ’m sorry for the rant . It just came out . ”
28712	28738	28508	28508	He	68	“ It ’s fine , dear . Do n’t give it another thought . I ’m always here to listen if you need an ear . ”
28739	28745	28746	28746	I	0	“ Thanks , Mr. Calloway . ”
28793	28807	28808	28808	I	0	“ I ’m surprised it took you this long to talk to me , ”
28811	28815	28816	28816	he	619	“ About what ? ”
28828	28838	28816	28816	he	619	“ About me and Kinsley at dinner last night . ”
28839	28872	28819	28819	he	619	“ Ah , that . Well , you had a reasonable excuse . That was nice of you to help her out with her car . I ’m sure she appreciated it . ”
28873	28877	28878	28878	I	0	“ Appreciated it ? ”
28883	28897	28878	28878	I	0	“ She did n’t appreciate anything . That woman is insufferable , Dad . ”
28898	28902	28903	28903	he	619	“ I see , ”
28911	28918	28906	28906	he	619	“ Why do you say that ? ”
28919	28953	28954	28954	I	0	“ She told me I was insecure and that ’s why I sleep around . Like what the hell does she mean by that ? She has a smart mouth , that one . ”
28959	28983	28954	28954	I	0	“ Maybe you should call the temp agency and get someone else . I ’m surprised you put up with that , Dad . ”
28984	29027	29028	29028	He	619	“ She ’s a good temp and I like her a lot . She is n’t going anywhere . In fact , as soon as Audrey comes back to work , I may find Kinsley a permanent position here at Calloway Tech . ”
29031	29039	29028	29028	He	619	“ We do n’t have any openings . ”
29047	29063	29040	29040	I	0	“ It ’s my company . I ’ll create a position if I have to . ”
29071	29079	29064	29064	I	0	“ It ’s half my company too . ”
29080	29096	29097	29097	He	619	“ But I have the majority rule . I have a meeting to get to . ”
29103	29130	29097	29097	He	619	“ Oh , by the way , I ’m having a little get together at the house this Saturday and you ’ll be there . Understand ? ”
29131	29139	29153	29153	he	619	“ What if I already have plans ? ”
29140	29149	29150	29150	he	619	“ Cancel them . Family is more important , ”
29276	29285	29274	29274	Carl	95	“ Hey , Chase , what ’s up ? ”
29286	29304	29255	29255	I	0	“ Hi , Carl . Do you know when Kinsley ’s car is going to be ready ? ”
29305	29314	29274	29274	Carl	95	“ Tomorrow afternoon , it ’ll be done . ”
29315	29320	29274	29274	Carl	95	“ Okay . Thanks . ”
29321	29330	29255	29255	I	0	“ No problem , Chase . Take care . ”
29331	29335	29274	29274	Carl	95	“ You too . ”
29362	29377	29378	29378	I	0	“ Your days of doing this are going to be coming to an end , ”
29383	29398	29399	29399	Steven	69	“ Yeah , man , once you ’re married , you ’re done for , ”
29402	29427	29428	29428	Alex	55	“ Nah . Things will change a little bit , but we ’ll always have guy night . I ’m not giving that up , ”
29431	29440	29441	29441	Steven	69	“ And what about when the babies come ? ”
29444	29458	29441	29441	Steven	69	“ You ’re going to be expected to stay home every single night . ”
29459	29466	29467	29467	I	0	“ I ’m never having kids . ”
29470	29482	29467	29467	I	0	“ Too much work and too much of a lifestyle change . ”
29483	29496	29497	29497	Alex	55	“ Yeah . God forbid you think of someone other than yourself . ”
29500	29523	29524	29524	I	0	“ Damn right ! I love my life too much to ever be burdened with a kid and a girlfriend or wife . ”
29530	29543	29544	29544	Alex	55	“ Well , we ’re having kids . We agreed on two , ”
29547	29557	29544	29544	Alex	55	“ I ca n’t wait to be a dad . ”
29558	29565	29566	29566	I	0	“ Good for you , Alex , ”
29577	29584	29569	29569	I	0	“ Fatherhood is n’t for everyone . ”
29619	29643	29614	29614	I	0	“ Hey , I know your car is in the shop still , so I can pick you up tomorrow morning for work . ”
29670	29675	29676	29676	Alex	55	“ Hey , Chase ? ”
29683	29695	29676	29676	Alex	55	“ Is n’t that Kinsley out there on the dance floor ? ”
29696	29701	29676	29676	Alex	55	“ What ? Where ? ”
29702	29707	29708	29708	He	55	“ Right over there . ”
29711	29725	29726	29726	He	55	“ In the short black dress dancing with that good - looking guy . ”
29729	29739	29726	29726	He	55	“ I ’ll be damned . It is her . ”
29815	29828	29797	29797	I	0	“ Hello , love . Can I have a word with you ? ”
29829	29840	29841	29841	she	59	“ Chase . What the hell are you doing here ? ”
29848	29855	29856	29856	I	0	“ Excuse us for a moment , ”
29886	29892	29893	29893	she	59	“ What are you doing ? ”
29899	29921	29893	29893	she	59	“ I should be asking you the same thing , but I see you ’re letting your party girl out again . ”
29922	29933	29856	29856	I	0	“ So what ? It ’s none of your business . ”
29934	30012	29859	29867	the douche - looking guy she was dancing with	631	“ But it is when you ’re dancing with some douchebag - looking guy and he has his hands all over your ass . You ’re my father ’s secretary , and somehow , I feel it ’s my duty to make sure you ’re safe from the could - be rapists , murderers , and kidnappers here in Los Angeles . If something happened to you and I was there , my father would blame me . ”
30013	30024	29893	29893	she	59	“ Oh my God , will you just shut up ! ”
30025	30036	29856	29856	I	0	“ Seriously , though , who are you here with ? ”
30037	30052	29859	29867	the douche - looking guy she was dancing with	631	“ Lexi . I ’m here with Lexi . She ’s in the bathroom . ”
30053	30071	29893	29893	she	59	“ Oh . Well , I sent you a text message earlier and you did n’t respond . ”
30072	30086	29856	29856	I	0	“ I have n’t checked my phone . Why did you text me ? ”
30087	30107	30108	30108	I	0	“ I can pick you up for work in the morning since your car is still in the shop , ”
30111	30114	30115	30115	she	633	“ No , ”
30118	30121	30115	30115	she	633	“ No ? ”

30135	30141	29856	29856	I	0	“ I ’ll Uber it . ”
30142	30176	30190	30190	she	63	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . That costs money . You can ride in with me for free . So put your stubbornness aside because I ’m picking you up in the morning . ”
30177	30186	30190	30190	she	63	“ There you are . Hey , Chase . ”
30196	30203	30190	30190	she	63	“ What are you doing here ? ”

30229	30268	30224	30224	She	633	“ Of course everything ’s okay . I was just telling Kinsley that I ’ll pick her up in the morning at eight o’clock for work since her car is still in the shop . Right , Kinsley ? ”

30330	30352	30324	30324	He	635	“ The guy who ’s going to give you ten seconds to step away before I punch you in the face . ”

30418	30423	30424	30424	Kinsley	59	“ Are you okay ? ”
30439	30452	30453	30453	Lexi	63	“ Oh . That ’s going to look nasty in the morning , ”
30467	30474	30458	30458	Alex	55	“ A little late , guys . ”
30480	30490	30491	30491	Steven	69	“ Looks like you handled it on your own . ”
30494	30504	30505	30505	Kinsley	59	“ You really should get some ice on that , ”
30508	30514	30505	30505	Kinsley	59	“ I ’ll be fine . ”

30562	30567	30568	30568	Lexi	63	“ Are you sure ? ”
30575	30585	30568	30568	Lexi	63	“ Yeah . If it ’s okay with Kinsley . ”
30586	30603	30604	30604	she	63	“ It ’s fine , and he ’s right , I ’m on his way home , ”
30643	30655	30656	30656	Kinsley	59	“ You did n’t have to tell him to move along , ”
30659	30669	30656	30656	Kinsley	59	“ Yes , I did . He looked shady . ”
30696	30716	30689	30689	she	59	“ You need to get ice on that hand and eye . Come up and let me help you . ”
30717	30733	30770	30770	her	59	“ I ’m fine , Kinsley . I ’ll do it when I get home . ”

30754	30759	30751	30751	She	59	“ Who are you ? ”
30819	30826	30827	30827	I	0	“ This might hurt a little . ”
30840	30843	30844	30844	He	647	“ Ouch . ”
30847	30857	30858	30858	I	0	“ Hold that while I tend to your hand . ”
30874	30887	30888	30888	I	0	“ What ’s your dad going to say when he sees you ? ”
30891	30921	30922	30922	I	0	“ The same thing he always does . ‘ Get your shit together , son . You ’re thirty years old . You ’re disgracing the Calloway name . ’ ”
30955	30974	30944	30944	Our	648	“ My dad died of a heroin overdose when I was six and my mother is an alcoholic . ”
30975	30984	30944	30944	Our	648	“ Kinsley , you do n’t have to — ”
30985	31123	30944	30944	Our	648	“ I do . I had to grow up fast . Faster than any child should ever have to . I ’d been taking care of her and myself since I was a kid . Not only was she an alcoholic , but she was a stripper , so she worked nights and slept all day . I got myself ready for school , made my own lunch , and got myself on the bus . When I ’d come home , she ’d already have a few drinks in her and would be passed out on the couch . I ’d have to wake her up to get ready for work . We never had any money because once she paid the few bills she had , she ’d blow the rest of it on alcohol . ”
31124	31137	30944	30944	Our	648	“ Kinsley , I had no idea . Was she ever violent ? ”
31138	31141	31142	31142	I	0	“ No . ”
31149	31239	31142	31142	I	0	“ She never cared enough to get violent . In fact , she never cared about me period . She forgot about my birthday on several occasions because she was either too drunk or passed out . And when she did remember , she ’d throw ten dollars at me and tell me to go buy myself something nice . She even missed my high school graduation because she was too hungover and could n’t get out of bed . Even though she promised me she ’d be there . ”
31256	31266	31240	31240	Chase	69	“ Why did you wait so long to leave ? ”
31267	31343	30944	30944	Our	648	“ It took me years of working to save up enough money . I started working at the antique shop when I was sixteen and I saved every dime I could . After a month of walking to work because I did n’t have any other way of getting there , Mrs. Buckley gave me her husband ’s car because she said she it was time to give it away and I could use it . ”
31344	31354	31142	31142	I	0	“ Mrs. Buckley sounds like a very sweet woman . ”
31355	31359	31360	31360	I	0	“ She was . ”
31363	31508	31360	31360	I	0	“ She was very generous and the kindest person I ’d ever met . She wished she could pay me more , but the truth was , the antique shop was n’t doing that good and she was in a lot of debt . After she passed away , I found I had enough money saved to at least get me here and get a place , and I ’d figure out the rest when I got here . But then I met Henry and I had this vision of the two of us living this happy perfect life in California . I wanted him to come with me , but he and his dad owned a roofing company and he could n’t leave . So , like an idiot , I stayed and ended up working as a waitress in a greasy diner . ”
31509	31519	31142	31142	I	0	“ Of course you stayed . You loved him . ”
31520	31546	31547	31547	I	0	“ I thought I did , but looking back on it , I fell in love with the idea that someone could actually love me . ”
31551	31600	31547	31547	I	0	“ Before I left , I tried waking up my mom , who was passed out on the couch . She stirred and mumbled , ‘ Not now , Kinsley . ’ So I ’m sorry if you think that I ’m a coward for leaving a note . ”
31617	31667	31603	31603	his	650	“ Do n’t apologize . You ’re not a coward . I had no idea your life was like that . And do n’t you ever doubt that someone could love you . You fought your way through life because you knew you deserved better . And now look . ”
31674	31721	31671	31671	his	650	“ You ’re here in California , living in this nice apartment , and you ’ve made great friends . This is your life now , Kinsley , and you made it . You ! Nobody else , and you should be so proud of yourself . ”
31722	31727	31728	31728	He	650	“ Thanks , Chase . ”
31802	31808	31809	31809	he	650	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
32206	32213	32214	32214	he	650	“ Come for me , darling , ”
32254	32261	32262	32262	Chase	69	“ God , that ’s beautiful , ”
32421	32427	32428	32428	he	650	“ Yes . Fuck yes ! ”
32487	32492	32493	32493	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
32496	32513	32493	32493	I	0	“ The fucking condom broke . Look . Please tell me you ’re on birth control . ”
32514	32574	32474	32474	he	650	“ Shit . No . I ’m not . I took the last of my pills a few weeks ago and I have n’t seen a doctor here yet . But do n’t worry , I ’ll go first thing tomorrow and get the morning after pill . I have up to seventy - two hours to take it . ”
32575	32583	32584	32584	he	650	“ So you ’ve taken it before ? ”
32587	32597	32598	32598	He	650	“ Once , and trust me , it works . ”
32644	32650	32635	32635	I	0	“ I should get going , ”
32665	32673	32654	32654	he	69	“ Yeah . I think you should . ”
32696	32701	32702	32702	I	0	“ Does it hurt ? ”
32705	32716	32702	32702	I	0	“ A little bit , but I ’ll be fine . ”
32720	32746	32717	32717	He	69	“ I ’ll pick you up around seven forty - five tomorrow since we need to stop at the drug store . Is that okay ? ”
32747	32752	32753	32753	I	0	“ That ’s fine . ”
32765	32777	32778	32778	he	69	“ I hope this does n’t make things awkward between us , ”
32781	32799	32800	32800	I	0	“ Nah . It was just sex . No big deal . Look at it this way , ”
32807	32819	32800	32800	I	0	“ When I want it , I know who to call . ”
32820	32830	32831	32831	He	69	“ You can give me a booty call anytime . ”
32834	32846	32831	32831	He	69	“ I ’ll see you in the morning . Sleep well . ”
32847	32851	32800	32800	I	0	“ You too . ”
33106	33110	33111	33111	I	0	“ Good morning , ”
33114	33118	33119	33119	she	59	“ Good morning , ”
33128	33135	33119	33119	she	59	“ What ’s in the bag ? ”
33136	33142	33178	33178	I	0	“ A box of condoms . ”
33143	33170	33171	33171	She	59	“ Oh , so now you ’re carrying the whole box with you ? Do n’t want to run the risk of running out too soon ? ”
33174	33177	33171	33171	She	59	“ No . ”
33186	33207	33178	33178	I	0	“ I ’m taking it back to the drugstore . They ’re expired . That ’s probably why it broke . ”
33208	33222	33171	33171	She	59	“ Oh . You did n’t notice the date before you bought them ? ”
33223	33252	33178	33178	I	0	“ I never look at the date . I just assume they ’re fresh . God knows they probably restock every other day . Did you sleep well ? ”
33253	33261	33178	33178	I	0	“ I did . How about you ? ”
33262	33268	33269	33269	I	0	“ Yeah . I did , ”
33272	33279	33280	33280	she	59	“ Let me see your eye , ”
33297	33300	33301	33301	She	59	“ Ouch . ”
33310	33320	33303	33303	her	59	“ Your dad is going to be asking questions . ”
33321	33339	33340	33340	I	0	“ I know . I ’ll come up with something on the spot . I always do . ”
33380	33386	33387	33388	the saleswoman	672	“ Can I help you ? ”
33391	33402	33387	33388	the saleswoman	672	“ I need to return this box of expired condoms . ”
33403	33410	33387	33388	the saleswoman	672	“ Do you have a receipt ? ”
33411	33425	33387	33388	the saleswoman	672	“ No . I do n’t usually keep the receipts for condom purchases . ”
33426	33457	33458	33458	I	0	“ Then how do I know you did n’t buy these before the expiration date , used a couple , and now are exchanging them for non - expired ones ? ”
33468	33509	33510	33510	Kinsley	59	“ Sweetheart , it ’s obvious you do n’t know who I am . I do n’t use just a couple . I use the whole damn box and rather quickly . I just bought these a couple days ago . ”
33522	33549	33510	33510	Kinsley	59	“ You do n’t have proof you bought them a couple of days ago , and without a receipt , I ca n’t take them back . ”
33550	33596	33510	33510	Kinsley	59	“ Listen , darling . This woman and I had sex last night and the damn condom broke because it was expired . Do you understand the danger of selling expired condoms ? Because it broke , she had to get the morning after pill . ”
33597	33628	33629	33629	I	0	“ Two forms of protection is the way to go , sir . Personally , I would n’t have had sex with her if she was n’t on birth control . ”
33650	33662	33663	33663	I	0	“ I did n’t know she was n’t on birth control , ”
33670	33689	33663	33663	I	0	“ Then you should n’t be having sex with her if you do n’t know her that well . ”
33690	33704	33712	33712	Kinsley	59	“ Again , it ’s obvious you do n’t know who I am . ”
33705	33711	33712	33712	Kinsley	59	“ Oh for fuck sakes . ”
33732	33746	33747	33747	She	59	“ Ring up the new box , please . This is absolutely ridiculous . ”
33760	33766	33767	33767	She	59	“ Have a good day . ”
33780	33822	33767	33767	She	59	“ Let ’s go . We ’re going to be late and I do n’t want to have tell your father that you were in a heated discussion with the salesgirl at the drugstore over a damn box of expired condoms . ”
33823	33836	33837	33837	I	0	“ Someone ’s grumpy this morning . Did you take your pill ? ”
33883	33892	33920	33920	she	59	“ Have a good day , Miss Davis . ”
33893	33916	33917	33917	She	59	“ You too , Mr. Calloway . I ca n’t wait to hear what Daddy has to say about that nasty bruise . ”
33926	33946	33947	33947	Lexi	63	“ Looks like someone is in a good mood despite that nasty - ass bruise on that beautiful face , ”
33957	33963	33950	33950	she	63	“ Good morning , darling . ”
33964	33976	33950	33950	she	63	“ So what happened last night after you took Kinsley home ? ”
33977	33990	33991	33991	I	0	“ Nothing . She put some ice on my hand and eye , ”
34001	34011	34012	34012	she	59	“ Oh my God , you slept with her ! ”
34016	34023	34024	34024	Steven	69	“ Who did he sleep with ? ”
34033	34036	34037	34037	Lexi	63	“ Kinsley ! ”
34040	34046	34037	34037	Lexi	63	“ Bro , good job . ”
34060	34079	34050	34050	he	69	“ Will the two of you knock it off . I do n’t want to talk about it . ”
34080	34088	34089	34089	Lexi	63	“ Oh , Chase . What happened ? ”
34096	34139	34140	34140	He	69	“ As much as I want to stay and hear the juicy details , I just came to drop this file off and now I have a meeting to get to before your dad has my head . Fill me in later . ”
34151	34166	34167	34167	Lexi	63	“ Spill it , Calloway . There ’s something you ’re not telling me , ”
34183	34194	34170	34170	she	63	“ I do n’t know . It was just weird . ”
34195	34202	34203	34203	She	63	“ Sex with Kinsley was weird ? ”
34208	34221	34203	34203	She	63	“ No . Sex with her was amazing . It was after . ”
34222	34229	34170	34170	she	63	“ I do n’t follow you . ”
34230	34254	34255	34255	I	0	“ I left her place , went home , and found myself in a funk . I ca n’t explain it , Lexi . ”
34267	34297	34255	34255	I	0	“ I ’m always in a fantastic mood after sex , but last night , I was n’t . I was in a not - so - good mood . ”
34298	34320	34170	34170	she	63	“ Wow , Chase . I think you ’ve had feelings for her all along and last night sealed the deal . ”
34321	34344	34170	34170	she	63	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . I do n’t have feelings for women and you know it . Not even for Kinsley . ”
34345	34373	34255	34255	I	0	“ So how did you leave things ? You have to see her every day . If you hurt her , Chase , I swear to God … ”
34374	34381	34382	34382	I	0	“ I did n’t hurt her . ”
34385	34400	34382	34382	I	0	“ We both agreed that we would n’t let things be awkward between us . ”
34401	34420	34255	34255	I	0	“ So she does n’t want anything more now that she ’s had the Chase Calloway sizzle stick . ”
34421	34481	34255	34255	I	0	“ Jesus , Lexi . And no , she did n’t lead me to believe she did . But , if she does , I ’ll have to set her straight . In fact , take her to lunch today and get some information from her about last night . I ’ll expect a report when you get back . ”
34482	34494	34255	34255	I	0	“ She ’s my friend . I ’m not doing that . ”
34495	34537	34255	34255	I	0	“ And I ’m your best friend in the world and your boss and I just gave you an assignment . If she wants more , then I ’ll have to make a plan on how to let her down gently . ”
34538	34571	34255	34255	I	0	“ Well , if that ’s the case , then you better wait and do it when she leaves here , or else Daddy Calloway is going to be pissed as hell . ”
34572	34583	34255	34255	I	0	“ I can handle my father . Just do it . ”
34584	34597	34598	34598	She	681	“ Ca n’t wait to hear what he says about that bruise . ”
34701	34706	34707	34707	I	0	“ Hello , beautiful . ”
34718	34721	34722	34722	She	59	“ Hello . ”
34731	34742	34724	34724	her	59	“ Here ’s the money for the box of condoms . ”
34743	34747	34748	34748	She	59	“ Thank you . ”
34765	34777	34759	34760	my father	1277	“ Chase . Please step your bruised face into my office . ”
34790	34797	34782	34782	I	0	“ Care to explain what happened ? ”
34798	34810	34828	34828	My	0	“ Some idiot punched me , so I punched him back . ”
34811	34823	34870	34870	He	1277	“ What did you do ? Have sex with his girl ? ”
34824	34827	34828	34828	My	0	“ No . ”
34832	34845	34828	34828	My	0	“ It was just a misunderstanding . He was a total douche . ”
34846	34851	34852	34852	he	1277	“ Was Kinsley involved ? ”
34855	34865	34852	34852	he	1277	“ No . Why would you ask me that ? ”
34887	34916	34870	34870	He	1277	“ See , there ’s my temp standing next to you at a club . Now I ’m going to ask you one last time , what happened ? ”
34917	35046	34870	34870	He	1277	“ I did n’t know Kinsley was at the club . I was there with Alex and Steven for a guys ’ night out and she was there with Lexi . I saw her dancing on the dance floor with some douchebag and he had his hands all over her ass . It was totally inappropriate , so I intervened and pulled her aside . I explained to her that he could be a rapist , murderer , or kidnapper , and that if anything happened to her , you ’d blame me because I was there . Then the douche walked over to us and I politely told him to go away and that ’s when he punched me , as you can see in the video . ”
35047	35073	34870	34870	He	1277	“ Okay then . That ’s good enough for me . I believe you did the right thing by getting her away from that guy . ”
35074	35084	35085	35085	I	0	“ Seriously , Dad ? You ’re not mad ? ”
35090	35130	35085	35085	I	0	“ No . You possibly saved her from making a mistake and I probably would have done the same thing . I ’m actually surprised you cared enough since the two of you do n’t seem to get along . ”
35131	35148	34870	34870	He	1277	“ Well , she works for the company and I suppose she ’s not that bad . ”
35149	35163	35164	35164	He	690	“ I swear to God , Chase , if you slept with her … ”
35169	35174	35164	35164	He	690	“ I did n’t . ”
35181	35191	35192	35192	I	0	“ I drove her home and that ’s it , ”
35195	35207	35192	35192	I	0	“ Are we finished here ? I have work to do . ”
35208	35225	35226	35226	He	690	“ Yes . We ’re finished . Stay out of trouble , and I mean it . ”
35242	35250	35251	35251	She	59	“ I did n’t hear any yelling . ”
35254	35272	35251	35251	She	59	“ That ’s because he was cool with my saving you from the douche - looking guy . ”
35278	35289	35273	35273	She	59	“ You do n’t know that he was a douchebag . ”
35290	35324	35325	35325	I	0	“ He had his hands all over your ass when you were dancing . That makes him a douchebag . And another thing , I ca n’t believe you let him do that . ”
35330	35343	35327	35327	my	0	“ Like you said , I was letting my party girl out . ”
35348	35363	35344	35344	Her	59	“ You act like you ’re jealous . Are you jealous , Mr. Calloway ? ”
35364	35374	35273	35273	She	59	“ Fuck no . Why would I be jealous ? ”
35375	35393	35327	35327	my	0	“ Because some stranger had his hands all over my ass and I would n’t let you . ”
35394	35431	35273	35273	She	59	“ For the record , darling , my hands were all over your ass and other delicious parts of your body . Have you forgotten already ? And you better be very careful with your answer . ”
35432	35445	35446	35446	She	59	“ I have n’t forgotten , but that was after the fact . ”
35449	35469	35446	35446	She	59	“ You can rest assure that I was in no way jealous . I ’m not the jealous type . ”
35482	35490	35491	35491	she	59	“ I ’ll talk to you later , ”
35593	35599	35600	35600	Lexi	63	“ It ’s lunch time ! ”
35608	35615	35603	35603	she	63	“ How about some Thai food ? ”
35616	35620	35621	35621	I	0	“ Sounds good . ”
35642	35681	35624	35624	I	0	“ Thanks for helping Chase out last night with the ice . I asked him if he put ice on it as soon as he got home and he said you made him when he drove you home . ”
35682	35707	35747	35747	her	63	“ No problem . To be honest , I did n’t trust him to do it himself . You know how stubborn guys are . ”
35708	35712	35713	35713	She	698	“ For sure . ”
35716	35726	35713	35713	She	698	“ How are the two of you getting along ? ”
35727	35739	35747	35747	her	63	“ We ’re getting along . Has he told you anything ? ”
35740	35744	35745	35745	Lexi	63	“ About what ? ”
35750	35755	35747	35747	her	63	“ About last night . ”
35756	35781	35747	35747	her	63	“ All he said was that you helped him with the ice . Why ? Did something else happen between the two of you ? ”
35801	35808	35782	35782	I	0	“ Did you sleep with him ? ”
35809	35812	35813	35813	I	0	“ Yes . ”
35816	35830	35813	35813	I	0	“ It just happened . It was in the heat of the moment . ”
35831	35849	35782	35782	I	0	“ Okay . That ’s understandable , but you told me you ’d never sleep with him . ”
35850	35854	35813	35813	I	0	“ I know . ”
35860	35872	35873	35873	she	698	“ So how are you feeling about it or him now ? ”
35876	36046	35873	35873	she	698	“ I do n’t know . I saw a different side of him last night , and I ’ll admit it was nice , but I ca n’t let myself feel anything , and I wo n’t . I just got out of a yearlong relationship and I do n’t trust men , especially Chase . Plus , I came here to find and reinvent myself and the last thing I need is to get wrapped up in some guy . I was never known as Kinsley Davis . People always referred to me as that poor girl whose mother was an alcoholic . Or that poor girl whose father overdosed on drugs . Or Henry ’s girlfriend . That ’s how I grew up , as ‘ that poor girl . ’ I want people to see me for who I really am and that ’s Kinsley Davis . I ca n’t be me until I find me and detach from the ‘ that poor girl ’ label . ”
36047	36055	36056	36056	She	699	“ I ’m so sorry , Kinsley . ”
36066	36083	36056	36056	She	699	“ And I totally agree with you . You need to find and love yourself first . ”
36107	36110	36111	36111	I	0	“ Hello , ”
36114	36133	36111	36111	I	0	“ Kinsley , it ’s Carl . Your car is ready . You can pick it up anytime . ”
36134	36153	36166	36166	her	63	“ Thanks , Carl . I appreciate it . I ’ll be by after work to get it . ”
36154	36161	36162	36162	I	0	“ Great . See you then . ”
36184	36187	36188	36188	I	0	“ Hey . ”
36199	36209	36210	36210	He	69	“ Hello , beautiful . What brings you by ? ”
36213	36236	36210	36210	He	69	“ My car is ready . Do you think you can drop me off after work so I can pick it up ? ”
36237	36248	36270	36270	Chase	69	“ Sure . Just swing by here before you leave . ”
36249	36254	36270	36270	Chase	69	“ Thanks , Chase . ”
36255	36265	36210	36210	He	69	“ No problem . I ’ll see you later . ”
36271	36274	36275	36275	I	0	“ Lexi , ”
36281	36290	36291	36291	She	706	“ Can I see you for a moment ? ”
36301	36326	36291	36291	She	706	“ I know what you ’re going to ask , so I ’ll just tell you . She does n’t have feelings for you . ”
36327	36332	36333	36333	I	0	“ She said that ? ”
36341	36344	36333	36333	I	0	“ Yes . ”
36345	36355	36291	36291	She	706	“ Impossible . Women always have feelings for me . ”
36356	36371	36291	36291	She	706	“ In case you have n’t noticed , Kinsley is n’t like other women . ”
36372	36393	36333	36333	I	0	“ Maybe not , but she ’s still a woman , and after sex with me , their feelings intensify . ”
36394	36425	36291	36291	She	706	“ Not with Kinsley . And why the hell do you seem disappointed ? Is n’t this what you wanted ? Now you do n’t have to worry about it . ”
36426	36439	36291	36291	She	706	“ I ’m not disappointed . I ’m relieved . Thank you . ”
36440	36453	36480	36480	she	708	“ You ’re welcome . Can I get back to work now ? ”
36454	36463	36464	36464	I	0	“ You mean shopping online for new clothes ? ”
36473	36476	36464	36464	I	0	“ And ? ”
36503	36507	36508	36508	I	0	“ You ready ? ”
36518	36531	36508	36508	I	0	“ Yes . I ca n’t wait to get my car back . ”
36547	36554	36555	36555	she	59	“ What are you doing tonight ? ”
36558	36570	36555	36555	she	59	“ I have n’t decided yet . Why are you asking ? ”
36571	36595	36596	36596	She	59	“ I do n’t know . I just thought maybe you ’d want to come over and put those new condoms to use . ”
36599	36603	36596	36596	She	59	“ Kinsley Davis . ”
36617	36627	36604	36604	I	0	“ Are you letting your party girl out again ? ”
36628	36642	36596	36596	She	59	“ Yes , Mr. Calloway . I am . Is that a problem ? ”
36643	36658	36604	36604	I	0	“ No . No problem at all . What time should I be over ? ”
36659	36668	36669	36669	She	59	“ Eight o’clock . And bring a pizza . ”
36700	36705	36706	36706	She	59	“ See you later . ”
36927	36932	36933	36933	He	69	“ Dinner is served . ”
36940	36947	36933	36933	He	69	“ Thanks . I ’m starving . ”
36948	36953	36954	36954	he	69	“ You look sexy , ”
36971	36975	36954	36954	he	69	“ Thank you . ”
37029	37039	37040	37040	His	69	“ You look more delicious than the pizza does . ”
37135	37143	37144	37144	he	69	“ Fuck , I ’m so hard , ”
37180	37217	37218	37218	he	69	“ First I ’m going to make you orgasm this way . Then you ’ll have another one with my mouth , and then a third one with my cock buried deep inside that beautiful pussy , ”
37222	37231	37218	37218	he	69	“ What makes you so sure I will ? ”
37241	37253	37254	37254	He	69	“ Oh fuck , Kinsley . Trust me , you will . ”
37280	37286	37287	37287	he	69	“ Now you ’ll come , ”
37369	37374	37375	37375	I	0	“ Oh my God ! ”
37414	37417	37418	37418	he	69	“ Fuck , ”
37519	37527	37528	37528	he	69	“ You feel so good , baby , ”
37575	37584	37585	37585	he	69	“ I ’ve worked up quite an appetite , ”
37602	37611	37612	37612	I	0	“ It did n’t break , did it ? ”
37626	37629	37630	37630	He	69	“ No . ”
37633	37638	37630	37630	He	69	“ Everything was intact . ”
37666	37678	37679	37679	I	0	“ Lexi told me you ’ve never been in a relationship , ”
37682	37687	37688	37688	He	69	“ Nope . Never . ”
37696	37707	37688	37688	He	69	“ Why ? If you do n’t mind me asking . ”
37708	37714	37688	37688	He	69	“ I have my reasons . ”
37715	37729	37730	37730	I	0	“ And you ’re not going to share those reasons , are you ? ”
37733	37759	37730	37730	I	0	“ No . I ’m not . I ’m a firm believer that you do n’t need to be in a relationship to be happy . ”
37760	37768	37769	37769	I	0	“ Your dad and Penelope seem happy , ”
37772	37913	37769	37769	I	0	“ He ’s unhappy more than he is happy . I do n’t think one single person can make another happy long term . Life is about adventure and the thrill of spending time with people on a short - term basis . For example , with me , sex comes easy , but loyalty does n’t . Sure , I ’m loyal to my circle of friends , but I could n’t guarantee I ’d be with just one person . You of all people should understand that after what Henry did to you . He could n’t stay loyal . It ’s not who we are anymore . We ’re a generation of hook - ups instead of relationships . You do n’t have to love someone to feel good . You can get instant gratification with sex . ”
37936	37969	37925	37925	He	723	“ I ’m sure you ’re not raring to get into a relationship with someone . He broke your heart and I ’m sure you do n’t want to feel that again . ”
37970	37996	37997	37997	I	0	“ You ’re right , I do n’t , but there are people out there who wo n’t do that to the person they love , ”
38000	38008	38009	38009	he	723	“ Perhaps , but it ’s rare , ”
38012	38022	38023	38023	I	0	“ What was it like growing up for you ? ”
38026	38029	38023	38023	I	0	“ Why ? ”
38037	38052	38032	38032	his	723	“ I told you my story , so now I want to hear yours . ”
38053	38064	38032	38032	his	723	“ I do n’t talk about my childhood with anyone . ”
38065	38070	38071	38071	I	0	“ Not even me ? ”
38074	38081	38071	38071	I	0	“ Not even you , sweetheart . ”
38122	38135	38136	38136	She	724	“ Okay then . Thank you for the sex and the pizza . ”
38149	38161	38139	38139	she	724	“ What do you mean ? Are you kicking me out ? ”
38167	38184	38162	38162	I	0	“ I am . I got what I needed and now you ’re free to go . ”
38185	38194	38195	38195	I	0	“ You ’re serious , are n’t you ? ”
38202	38236	38195	38195	I	0	“ I ’m very serious , Chase . We hooked up , had dinner , and now I ’m going to take a bath . I ’ll see you tomorrow at the office . ”
38237	38246	38247	38247	I	0	“ Yeah . I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
38318	38321	38322	38322	Lexi	63	“ Hello , ”
38325	38330	38322	38322	Lexi	63	“ Are you home ? ”
38331	38336	38309	38309	her	726	“ Yes . Why ? ”
38337	38352	38322	38322	Lexi	63	“ I ’m on my way over . I need to talk to you . ”
38353	38358	38322	38322	Lexi	63	“ It sounds serious . ”
38359	38372	38309	38309	her	726	“ It is . I ’ll see you in about twenty minutes . ”
38373	38383	38384	38384	she	63	“ The door ’s unlocked . Just walk in , ”
38419	38425	38426	38426	Lexi	63	“ What ’s going on ? ”
38437	38458	38429	38429	I	0	“ I ’ll tell you what ’s going on . I had sex with Kinsley and she kicked me out . ”
38459	38462	38463	38463	She	63	“ What ? ”
38466	38474	38463	38463	She	63	“ It is n’t funny , Lexi . ”
38475	38488	38429	38429	I	0	“ Calm down , Chase , and tell me exactly what happened . ”
38489	38574	38429	38429	I	0	“ She asked me to come over for sex and she told me to bring a pizza , so I did . We had amazing sex first and then while we were eating , she asked me about my childhood . I told her I do n’t talk about it with anyone , including her , and she said okay and told me to leave . She said she got what she wanted and I was free to go . Do you believe that ? ”
38575	38583	38584	38584	Lexi	63	“ Is n’t that what you do ? ”
38589	38592	38593	38593	I	0	“ Exactly ! ”
38598	38620	38593	38593	I	0	“ It ’s what I do . I think she was pissed because I would n’t tell her about my childhood . ”
38621	38642	38584	38584	Lexi	63	“ Maybe a little . But I think you ’re reading too much into it . Did she seem upset ? ”
38643	38663	38664	38664	Lexi	63	“ No ! She was smiling the whole time . She said she was going to take a bath . ”
38675	38680	38668	38668	I	0	“ Listen , Chase . ”
38693	38736	38688	38688	her	63	“ She obviously wants to get to know you . It does n’t mean she wants a relationship . But friends know things about each other . She told you about her childhood , so she expected you to do the same . ”
38737	38752	38753	38753	I	0	“ I do n’t talk about it and I do n’t talk about her . ”
38759	38800	38753	38753	I	0	“ I know you do n’t , but maybe it would n’t hurt to tell Kinsley . Just because you tell her does n’t make her your girlfriend . It does n’t put the two of you in a relationship . ”
38801	38819	38688	38688	her	63	“ It ’s none of her concern , Lexi . The only thing between us is sex . ”
38820	38839	38753	38753	I	0	“ Then if that ’s the case , why are you so pissed off she asked you leave ? ”
38840	38870	38688	38688	her	63	“ Because it was childish of her , and to be honest , I ’m disappointed in her . I did n’t take her for that type of woman . ”
38877	38930	38873	38873	Lexi	63	“ That was n’t childish behavior , Chase . That was her telling you if you did n’t want to talk about your childhood , then she was going to make better use of her time instead of wasting it on someone who wo n’t open up . Especially right after sex . ”
38931	38944	38945	38945	I	0	“ And taking a bath is making better use of her time ? ”
38950	38957	38945	38945	I	0	“ Apparently to her it is . ”
38961	38971	38958	38958	She	63	“ I ’m glad you find all this amusing . ”
38972	38984	38985	38985	She	63	“ Karma ’s a bitch . Is n’t it ? Finally . ”
38993	39015	38987	38987	her	63	“ A woman who stands up for herself where you ’re concerned . I never thought I ’d see the day . ”
39039	39053	39021	39021	I	0	“ I need to go home . I ’ll see you tomorrow morning . ”
39323	39330	39331	39331	I	0	“ Good morning , Mr. Calloway . ”
39342	39372	39331	39331	I	0	“ Good morning , Kinsley . Before I forget , Penelope and I are having a barbeque at the house tomorrow and we ’d love for you to come . ”
39373	39379	39331	39331	I	0	“ I ’d love to . ”
39380	39396	39331	39331	I	0	“ Excellent . It starts at four o’clock . I ’ll text you the address . ”
39397	39404	39405	39405	I	0	“ Thank you , Mr. Calloway . ”
39423	39447	39408	39408	I	0	“ Kinsley , I forgot to give you these when you were in my office . Can you take them over to Chase ? ”
39448	39451	39452	39452	I	0	“ Sure . ”
39491	39500	39501	39501	he	69	“ She ’s running an errand for me , ”
39521	39532	39533	39533	I	0	“ Your father wanted me to give these to you . ”
39539	39549	39550	39550	he	69	“ Thanks . How was your bath last night ? ”
39557	39560	39550	39550	he	69	“ Fine . ”
39561	39589	39590	39590	He	69	“ Just fine ? It should have been spectacular since you kicked me out to take one . Had you asked , I would ’ve joined you . ”
39593	39626	39590	39590	He	69	“ I ’m sure you would have , but you served your purpose to me and I was done . There was no need for you to stay any longer than necessary . ”
39635	39640	39641	39641	His	69	“ Served my purpose ? ”
39668	39704	39641	39641	His	69	“ You know what I mean . I asked you over for sex and pizza . We had both , you did n’t want to talk , and I wanted to take a relaxing bath . ”
39705	39708	39709	39709	He	69	“ Aha ! ”
39714	39737	39709	39709	He	69	“ So you did kick me out because I would n’t tell you about my childhood ! I knew you were pissed . ”
39738	39773	39641	39641	His	69	“ I was n’t pissed , Chase . You have every right not to tell me if you do n’t want to . There was nothing else to talk about , so why stay ? ”
39774	39785	39786	39786	Steven	69	“ Chase , bro . Oh , hello , Kinsley . ”
39789	39795	39796	39796	He	69	“ I can come back . ”
39802	39814	39796	39796	He	69	“ No need . I was just dropping off some files , ”
39996	40006	40007	40007	She	85	“ Nice of you to make it , Chase . ”
40010	40017	40007	40007	She	85	“ Your father will be pleased . ”
40018	40033	40034	40034	I	0	“ Thanks , Penelope . I would n’t have missed it for the world , ”
40144	40154	40134	40134	she	59	“ Well , well , look who ’s here . ”
40165	40170	40171	40171	Kinsley	59	“ Hi , Chase . ”
40174	40180	40181	40181	Adam	102	“ Chase , my man . ”
40191	40202	40184	40184	he	102	“ Long time no see . How have you been ? ”
40203	40221	40184	40184	he	102	“ Hello , Adam . I ’ve been great . Thank you . How ’s Mary doing ? ”
40222	40231	40184	40184	he	102	“ We are n’t seeing each other anymore . ”
40232	40253	40254	40254	I	0	“ Sorry to hear . She was such a lovely girl . I did n’t know my father invited you , ”
40259	40269	40254	40254	I	0	“ I ’m surprised you did n’t mention it . ”
40270	40282	40184	40184	he	102	“ He invited me yesterday and we did n’t really talk . ”
40283	40292	40293	40293	I	0	“ No . I suppose we did n’t , ”
40296	40329	40293	40293	I	0	“ Well , it looks like the two of you are having a fun conversation judging by all the laughter I saw , so I ’ll let you get back to it . ”
40387	40390	40391	40391	Lexi	63	“ Jealous ? ”
40403	40416	40394	40394	she	63	“ Of course not . Why the hell would I be jealous ? ”
40417	40435	40394	40394	she	63	“ Then why are you standing here staring at them like you ’re ready to kill someone ? ”
40436	40442	40443	40443	I	0	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
40452	40466	40443	40443	I	0	“ I was actually looking for my dad . Have you seen him ? ”
40467	40481	40394	40394	she	63	“ Last time I saw him , he was talking to Mr. Baine . ”
40482	40487	40488	40488	I	0	“ Sydney is here ? ”
40493	40498	40488	40488	I	0	“ Yeah . Why ? ”
40499	40511	40394	40394	she	63	“ I thought the two of them had a falling out . ”
40512	40526	40527	40527	she	758	“ I do n’t know . They were looking pretty chummy to me , ”
40530	40540	40541	40541	I	0	“ Why the hell is Kinsley talking to him ? ”
40549	40560	40544	40544	I	0	“ Ca n’t she tell what a douchebag he is ? ”
40561	40572	40573	40573	Lexi	63	“ You ’re a douchebag and she talks to you . ”
40576	40591	40573	40573	Lexi	63	“ I always thought Adam was hot . They kind of look cute together . ”
40592	40629	40544	40544	I	0	“ What the hell is the matter with you ? You ’re her friend . Go talk some sense into her . And no , they do n’t look cute together . She can do better . ”
40630	40636	40637	40637	Lexi	63	“ You mean like you ? ”
40642	40668	40637	40637	Lexi	63	“ Of course , but only if I ’m looking for a relationship . Which you know damn well I ’m not and never will . ”
40669	40675	40676	40676	She	63	“ If you say so . ”
40682	40689	40694	40694	he	1277	“ Chase , there you are , ”
40700	40710	40711	40711	I	0	“ Hello , Dad . Why is Kinsley here ? ”
40725	40738	40719	40719	Adam	102	“ She ’s my secretary . Why would n’t I invite her ? ”
40739	40757	40694	40694	he	1277	“ She ’s your temp and you ’ve never invited the temps to one of your barbeques . ”
40758	40790	40829	40829	him	760	“ She ’s with us for at least two months . Do you have a problem with her being here ? I thought the two of you were getting along now . ”
40791	40803	40694	40694	he	1277	“ We are . I just wondered , that ’s all . ”
40804	40814	40815	40815	he	760	“ Why are you staring at her and Adam ? ”
40818	40824	40815	40815	he	760	“ I ’m not staring . ”
40854	40872	40844	40844	Penelope	85	“ We ’ll talk later . Go enjoy yourself . There are plenty of beautiful women here . ”
41029	41037	41038	41038	I	0	“ What ’s going on over here ? ”
41041	41046	41038	41038	I	0	“ Hello , Kinsley . ”
41050	41061	41047	41047	Chase	46	“ I ’d like you to meet Karina and Renee . ”
41070	41087	41088	41088	He	46	“ Where ’s Adam ? The two of you seemed to be attached at the hip . ”
41091	41100	41101	41101	I	0	“ He had to make a phone call , ”
41104	41124	41101	41101	I	0	“ Would you like to join us ? I ’m afraid , though , I only have two arms . ”
41125	41147	41182	41182	Karina	105	“ Umm . No . That ’s okay . I would n’t want to intrude on your little ménage a trois . ”
41148	41156	41157	41157	He	46	“ Darling , the more the merrier . ”
41160	41165	41166	41166	He	46	“ Right , ladies ? ”
41173	41181	41166	41166	He	46	“ Yeah . The more the merrier . ”
41272	41277	41270	41270	Dana	109	“ Hey , you . ”
41281	41294	41295	41295	She	63	“ I saw you talking to Adam . What ’s going on ? ”
41298	41301	41295	41295	She	63	“ Nothing . ”
41306	41318	41295	41295	She	63	“ Actually , we ’re going on a date tomorrow night . ”
41319	41324	41325	41325	Lexi	63	“ Good for you ! ”
41331	41342	41325	41325	Lexi	63	“ He ’s a nice guy and he ’s hot . ”
41343	41389	41406	41406	she	63	“ He is . We seem to have a lot in common , but I did tell him I was n’t looking for any type of relationship and he said he was n’t either . He just got out of a three - year relationship . ”
41390	41402	41403	41403	She	63	“ Well , I ’m glad you ’re meeting new people . ”
41413	41418	41406	41406	she	63	“ Hello , ladies . ”
41433	41441	41422	41422	he	83	“ How about we get some food ? ”
41478	41484	41485	41485	He	46	“ May I join you ? ”
41492	41502	41485	41485	He	46	“ What happened to your little ménage a trois ? ”
41508	41513	41514	41514	He	46	“ I got bored . ”
41517	41527	41528	41528	Adam	102	“ Still nobody special in your life , Chase ? ”
41531	41546	41547	41547	He	46	“ And lose the title of Los Angeles ’ sexiest and most eligible bachelor ? ”
41550	41557	41558	41558	Adam	102	“ I guess you ’re right . ”
41561	41581	41558	41558	Adam	102	“ So , what happened between you and Mary ? I thought the two of you were getting married ? ”
41582	41590	41591	41591	he	46	“ We decided to call it quits , ”
41615	41619	41620	41620	Chase	46	“ Who cheated ? ”
41623	41627	41620	41620	Chase	46	“ Nobody cheated . ”
41628	41647	41657	41657	he	102	“ So that girl I saw you with in Vegas who was n’t Mary was just a friend ? ”
41662	41671	41657	41657	he	102	“ Yeah . She was just a friend . ”
41672	41684	41685	41685	He	102	“ Of course . What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas . ”
41688	41698	41699	41699	Adam	102	“ I know you ’re the expert on that , ”
41702	41716	41717	41717	Chase	46	“ Not really . What or who I do never stays in Vegas . ”
41720	41733	41717	41717	Chase	46	“ I have nothing to hide . I ’m an open book . ”

41743	41755	41756	41756	Adam	102	“ Is there something going on between the two of you ? ”
41766	41781	41782	41782	Chase	46	“ Other than the fact that we ’ve had sex , no , nothing , ”
41793	41799	41800	41800	Adam	102	“ And when was this ? ”
41803	41809	41810	41810	Chase	46	“ A few days ago . ”
41841	41884	41914	41914	his	46	“ Okay then . Listen , Kinsley , I better get going . I have somewhere else I have to be in a while . It was nice meeting you and I ’ll be in touch . See ya around , Chase . ”
41885	41899	41900	41900	he	46	“ Of course . Let ’s do dinner one night and catch up , ”
41930	41938	41939	41939	he	46	“ What the hell are you doing ? ”
41946	41957	41939	41939	he	46	“ Why did you tell him we had sex ? ! ”
41965	41969	41958	41958	I	0	“ He asked . ”
41970	41997	41923	41923	he	46	“ No , he did n’t ! He asked if anything was going on between us , and all you had to do was say no ! ”
41998	42015	41958	41958	I	0	“ I did say no , besides us having sex . What ’s the big deal ? ”
42016	42033	41958	41958	I	0	“ We were supposed to go out on a date tomorrow and now you ruined it ! ”
42034	42123	42124	42124	He	776	“ Oh . Well , if he ’s that insecure , then that ’s his problem . Besides , you do n’t want to go out with him anyway . He ’s a cheater . I saw him in Vegas with a woman , and trust me , they were not just friends . Need I remind you that he had a fiancée at the time ? And considering what you went through with Henry , I just saved you some heartache . So , you ’re welcome . ”
42146	42162	42127	42127	I	0	“ Stop telling people we had sex or I ’m going to tell your dad ! ”
42163	42173	42174	42174	He	776	“ You ’re going to tell my dad what ? ”
42177	42185	42174	42174	He	776	“ That we had sex ! Twice ! ”
42192	42203	42204	42204	He	776	“ Now , Kinsley . Do n’t do anything rash . ”
42270	42278	42279	42279	Lexi	63	“ What did you do to Kinsley ? ”
42295	42302	42282	42282	she	63	“ I did nothing to her . ”
42303	42317	42282	42282	she	63	“ Then why did I just see her stomp away all pissed off ? ”
42318	42328	42282	42282	she	63	“ I may have told Adam we slept together . ”
42329	42342	42282	42282	she	63	“ What the fuck , Chase ! Why would you do that ? ”
42343	42361	42282	42282	she	63	“ Because he ’s a cheater . She does n’t need to be going out with him . ”
42362	42371	42372	42372	She	63	“ That ’s not for you to decide . ”
42381	42399	42372	42372	She	63	“ Wait a minute . You could n’t stand the thought of her going out with him . ”
42400	42414	42415	42415	I	0	“ You ’re right . I know him and he ’s a douchebag , ”
42418	42425	42415	42415	I	0	“ No . No . No . ”
42431	42451	42428	42428	her	63	“ You ca n’t stand the thought of her going out with anyone besides you . You ’re jealous . ”
42455	42480	42452	42452	I	0	“ I am not jealous , Lexi . I do n’t do jealousy . How many times do I have to tell you that ? ”
42481	42523	42428	42428	her	63	“ I do n’t care what you say , Calloway . If you did n’t care or were n’t jealous , you would n’t have made it known the two of you slept together . You knew it would bother Adam . ”
42524	42528	42529	42529	I	0	“ So what ? ”
42532	42565	42529	42529	I	0	“ You ca n’t control other people ’s lives . Shit . Either you step up to the plate and tell her that you like her or leave her the hell alone ! ”
42625	42630	42612	42612	I	0	“ Hey , Chase . ”
42642	42650	42651	42651	She	63	“ You up for a little fun ? ”
42654	42675	42651	42651	She	63	“ I ’ll have to take a raincheck , sweetheart . I need to find someone and talk to them . ”
42676	42684	42685	42685	She	63	“ Ca n’t you find them after ? ”
42688	42695	42685	42685	She	63	“ No . I ’m sorry . ”
42718	42723	42724	42724	I	0	“ Hey , Steven . ”
42732	42738	42724	42724	I	0	“ Have you seen Kinsley ? ”
42739	42746	42729	42729	his	779	“ She left a while ago . ”
42747	42759	42724	42724	I	0	“ She left ? Did she say where she was going ? ”
42760	42778	42724	42724	I	0	“ I ’m assuming home . I do n’t know , bro . I did n’t ask . ”
42779	42782	42783	42783	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
42830	42839	42840	42840	she	63	“ What are you doing here , Chase ? ”
42847	42855	42840	42840	she	63	“ I need to talk to you . ”
42856	42860	42861	42861	She	63	“ About what ? ”
42866	42872	42861	42861	She	63	“ Can I come in ? ”
42873	42876	42877	42877	She	63	“ Fine . ”
42899	42919	42880	42880	I	0	“ I wanted to apologize to you for earlier . I ’m sorry I told Adam we slept together . ”
42920	42930	42931	42931	she	63	“ Why , Chase ? Why are you apologizing ? ”
42934	42951	42931	42931	she	63	“ Because I saw it upset you and I wanted to say that I was sorry . ”
42952	42964	42880	42880	I	0	“ What does it matter to you if it upset me ? ”
42965	42985	42880	42880	I	0	“ You ’re my friend , Kinsley , and the bottom line is I should n’t have said it . ”
42986	42991	42992	42992	she	63	“ We ’re friends ? ”
43003	43009	42992	42992	she	63	“ I thought we were . ”
43010	43027	43028	43028	I	0	“ I was under the impression that I was just another notch in your bed post . ”
43043	43059	43060	43060	I	0	“ I consider you my friend . We ’ve had some pretty good times together . ”
43063	43074	43060	43060	I	0	“ You ’re referring to sex , are n’t you ? ”
43075	43078	43079	43079	I	0	“ Yes . ”
43082	43094	43079	43079	I	0	“ Then I am just another notch in your bed post . ”
43104	43113	43095	43095	I	0	“ No , Kinsley , you ’re not . ”
43114	43126	43060	43060	I	0	“ Then why wo n’t you tell me anything about you ? ”
43127	43154	43060	43060	I	0	“ The only thing you do n’t know about me is my childhood and I ’m not going there . I need you to respect that . ”
43155	43183	43095	43095	I	0	“ You ’re wrong . I do n’t really know a thing about you except the fact that you ’re a sex addict and love beautiful women . ”
43184	43214	43215	43215	I	0	“ First off , I ’m not a sex addict . And yes , I do love beautiful women . Second of all , go ahead and ask away . ”
43218	43231	43215	43215	I	0	“ I ’ll answer any questions you have except about my childhood . ”
43232	43245	43095	43095	I	0	“ Did you always want to work for your dad ’s company ? ”
43246	43278	43095	43095	I	0	“ My dad ’s company was nothing more than a computer sales company . It was n’t until I developed a program when I was ten that his company took off . ”
43279	43282	43283	43283	she	785	“ Ten ? ”
43288	43357	43283	43283	she	785	“ Yes . Believe it or not , I ’m actually tipping the scale between being highly intellectual and genius level . I graduated high school when I was sixteen , went straight to Stanford , where I met Alex and Steven , graduated before I was twenty - one , and then my father gave me an office and a high - ranking position at the company . ”
43358	43369	43095	43095	I	0	“ So , Steven and Alex are older than you ? ”
43370	43440	43095	43095	I	0	“ Just by two years . I ’d actually been working for my father since I developed my first program . I coded , he paid me . I own half the company . That was the deal I made with him if he wanted me to continue developing systems and software for him . If it was n’t for me , he ’d still be just selling computers . ”
43441	43449	43450	43450	She	786	“ I guess you are very smart . ”
43453	43459	43460	43460	I	0	“ Career smart at least . ”
43463	43477	43460	43460	I	0	“ He runs the company and my team and I develop the products . ”
43478	43493	43494	43494	she	786	“ Why did n’t you just work for him instead of going to college ? ”
43497	43507	43508	43508	I	0	“ And miss out on the great college experience ? ”
43511	43550	43508	43508	I	0	“ I wanted to continue to learn , especially with the way technology changed so much . Plus , I needed to learn about business . When my father retires , I ’ll be taking over the company . ”
43551	43558	43559	43559	she	786	“ Did you play any sports ? ”
43562	43588	43559	43559	she	786	“ Nah . Sports never interested me . The only thing I cared about was technology , until I moved to California and started surfing . ”
43589	43604	43605	43605	She	786	“ So you were a geek and now you ’re a hot surfing geek ? ”
43608	43616	43617	43617	I	0	“ Yeah . I guess I am . ”
43660	43669	43654	43654	she	786	“ I ’m sorry I ruined your date . ”
43670	43683	43684	43684	I	0	“ It ’s okay . You did say he was a cheater . ”
43743	43748	43749	43749	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
43757	43764	43749	43749	I	0	“ Yes . I ’m sure . ”
43813	43821	43822	43822	I	0	“ Just stay . It ’s late , ”
43825	43830	43822	43822	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
43831	43843	43844	43844	He	69	“ If I was n’t , I would n’t have asked . ”
43891	43899	43900	43900	he	69	“ I have a question for you , ”
43903	43908	43900	43900	he	69	“ What is it ? ”
43909	43957	43900	43900	he	69	“ How could you not think we were friends ? After all , I did make sure you got home safely from my party , I stayed the night , and I made you coffee the next morning . I just do n’t do that for anybody . ”
43958	43981	43982	43982	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I just thought you did those things because you were trying to get into my pants . ”
43994	44000	43985	43985	I	0	“ True . I was . ”
44020	44080	44005	44005	I	0	“ Kinsley , I just need to make it very clear that I do n’t want anything more . I mean , I like you and I love having sex with you , but that ’s all I can give . Nothing more . It ’s not who I am , and I think you know that by now . ”
44081	44118	44137	44137	He	790	“ I do know that and I ’m not looking for anything more either . I love being on my own , discovering who I am , and trying to find the best version of me . ”
44119	44136	44137	44137	He	790	“ Well , if it makes you feel better , I like this version of you . ”
44347	44379	44344	44345	Mr. Calloway	68	“ It ’s okay , Kinsley . The most important thing is that you get better . Do n’t worry about it . I ’ll have Lexi fill in for you . ”
44380	44395	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ Thank you , Mr. Calloway . I ’ll be there for sure tomorrow . ”
44396	44401	44402	44402	I	0	“ Feel better soon . ”
44432	44444	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ Dad said you called in sick . Are you okay ? ”
44445	44461	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ I think that Chinese food we ate last night did n’t agree with me . ”
44462	44467	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ I ’m fine . ”
44468	44477	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ We did n’t eat the same thing . ”
44478	44484	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ Do you need anything ? ”
44485	44500	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ No . I think I ’m going back to sleep for a while . ”
44501	44513	44430	44430	Chase	69	“ Okay . Text or call me if you need anything . ”
44635	44642	44645	44645	Chase	69	“ It ’s me , Kinsley , ”
44663	44676	44677	44677	he	69	“ I ’ve brought you some soup . How are you feeling ? ”
44684	44694	44677	44677	he	69	“ Thank you . I ’m actually feeling better . ”
44695	44698	44699	44699	He	69	“ Good . ”
44717	44733	44702	44702	he	69	“ I ca n’t stay . I ’m having dinner with my dad and bridezilla . ”
44734	44741	44742	44742	I	0	“ Sounds like a fun time . ”
44745	44752	44742	44742	I	0	“ Is there a special occasion ? ”
44753	44792	44702	44702	he	69	“ It ’s Penelope ’s birthday this weekend , and since they ’re going on a trip and wo n’t be here , dear old Dad thought tonight would be a good night to get together for dinner . ”
44793	44802	44803	44803	I	0	“ Did you buy her a birthday gift ? ”
44818	44846	44806	44806	he	69	“ As much as it pains me to do it , I ’m going to stop at the florist on the way and pick up some flowers . ”
44847	44867	44868	44868	I	0	“ I like Penelope . She ’s really nice . I do n’t understand what you have against her , ”
44871	44880	44868	44868	I	0	“ I ’m just not fond of her . ”
44884	44905	44881	44881	He	69	“ I better head out . I do n’t want to get yelled at for being late . You good ? ”
44909	44920	44906	44906	He	69	“ I ’m good . Thanks again for the soup . ”
44921	44933	44934	44934	He	69	“ No problem . I ’m glad you ’re feeling better . ”
45144	45150	45151	45152	Mr. Calloway	68	“ Good morning , Kinsley . ”
45155	45162	45151	45152	Mr. Calloway	68	“ How are you feeling today ? ”
45163	45170	45171	45171	I	0	“ I feel a lot better , ”

45182	45192	45193	45193	I	0	“ Still recovering , but I do feel better , ”
45196	45224	45193	45193	I	0	“ Glad to hear it . Would you mind stepping into my office for a minute ? There ’s something I would like to discuss with you . ”

45277	45294	45295	45295	he	68	“ As you know , Audrey is supposed to be back in a couple of weeks , ”
45298	45304	45295	45295	he	68	“ Yes . I know . ”
45308	45350	45295	45295	he	68	“ I spoke to her yesterday and it seems her fiancé got a once - in - a - lifetime job in New York , so they ’re moving there , and she will not be coming back to Calloway Tech . ”

45432	45495	45496	45496	He	810	“ Say yes . I ’d love to keep you , Kinsley . You ’re a bright woman and you do a very good job . Plus , you can handle my son and I would n’t have to worry about his actions affecting you . You seem to be the only woman I ’ve ever known who ’s immune to him . ”
45506	45517	45518	45518	I	0	“ I would love to stay here at Calloway Tech . ”

45601	45619	45597	45597	I	0	“ Did your dad mention anything to you at dinner last night about Audrey not coming back ? ”
45620	45625	45564	45564	his	810	“ No . Why ? ”
45626	45646	45597	45597	I	0	“ Apparently , her and her fiancé are moving to New York , so she ’s not coming back . ”
45647	45665	45597	45597	I	0	“ Oh . Then I guess Daddy is going to have to find a new permanent secretary . ”
45666	45671	45672	45672	I	0	“ He did already , ”
45675	45690	45672	45672	I	0	“ Wow . That was fast . Did he tell you who he hired ? ”
45691	45694	45695	45695	I	0	“ Me . ”
45698	45709	45695	45695	I	0	“ He just offered me the full - time position . ”

45922	45942	45919	45919	she	59	“ Have a seat . Kinsley just told me that my dad hired her permanently to be his secretary . ”
45943	45950	45910	45910	her	59	“ What ? What about Audrey ? ”
45951	45963	45910	45910	her	59	“ Apparently , she ’s moving to New York with Dustin . ”
45964	45971	45972	45972	She	59	“ Oh . Good for Kinsley . ”
45975	45992	45972	45972	She	59	“ It ’s not a good idea and now I do n’t know what to do . ”
45993	45997	45998	45998	She	59	“ About what ? ”
46003	46007	46000	46000	her	59	“ About her . ”

46045	46048	46049	46049	Her	59	“ Why ? ”
46055	46095	46049	46049	Her	59	“ Because we ’ve been sleeping together for too long now . We work together and see each other every day . It ’s kind of hard to forget about her when she ’s sitting right down the hall . ”
46096	46111	46022	46022	I	0	“ So what you ’re saying is out of sight , out of mind ? ”
46112	46115	46116	46116	I	0	“ Exactly ! ”
46121	46140	46116	46116	I	0	“ How can I end things now that she ’s going to be working here full - time ? ”
46141	46150	46151	46151	she	59	“ Why would you want to end things ? ”
46154	46215	46116	46116	I	0	“ Because I feel like we ’re getting too close . I brought her chicken soup last night to her house . The other night when she stayed over , she left a few things in the bathroom . When I told her she left them , she said just to leave them there for when she stayed over again . ”
46350	46353	46354	46354	She	63	“ Hey . ”
46357	46366	46346	46346	Lexi	63	“ These are for Mr. Calloway to sign . ”
46367	46377	46378	46378	I	0	“ Thanks . I ’ll give them to him . ”
46385	46390	46391	46391	she	63	“ Are you okay ? ”
46396	46429	46391	46391	she	63	“ Yeah . In fact , I ’m great . I was going to walk over and see you . Audrey is n’t coming back and Mr. Calloway offered me her job . ”
46430	46442	46443	46443	She	63	“ Oh my God , Kinsley . I ’m so happy ! ”
46447	46454	46443	46443	She	63	“ You accepted it , right ? ”
46455	46461	46391	46391	she	63	“ Yeah . I did . ”
46462	46474	46391	46391	she	63	“ Let ’s celebrate tonight . Dinner and drinks on me . ”
46475	46487	46443	46443	She	63	“ Maybe another night . I ’m still not feeling well . ”
46488	46500	46391	46391	she	63	“ Oh . Okay . Another night it is , then . ”
46853	46870	46851	46851	Chase	45	“ Hey , I was thinking I could come over tonight . What do you say ? ”
46871	46874	46942	46942	he	45	“ No . ”
46875	46879	46851	46851	Chase	45	“ Why not ? ”
46880	46887	46851	46851	Chase	45	“ I ’m not feeling well . ”
46888	46910	46942	46942	he	45	“ Oh . I ’m sorry to hear that . Do you need anything ? I can bring you over something . ”
46911	46920	46851	46851	Chase	45	“ No . I have everything I need . ”
46921	46934	46935	46935	I	0	“ Okay . Get some rest and I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
47028	47034	47035	47035	Chase	45	“ Good morning , beautiful . ”
47044	47050	47038	47038	he	45	“ How are you feeling ? ”
47051	47059	47060	47060	I	0	“ Like crap . Thanks for asking , ”
47071	47082	47060	47060	I	0	“ Still ? Maybe you should go see a doctor . ”
47083	47104	47038	47038	he	45	“ So he can tell me I have a virus and to let it run its course ? No thanks . ”
47105	47111	47112	47112	he	45	“ Somebody is moody today , ”
47115	47133	47112	47112	he	45	“ Is there something you needed , Chase ? I have a lot of work to do . ”
47134	47147	47038	47038	he	45	“ No . I just stopped by to see how you were . ”
47148	47156	47157	47157	I	0	“ You could have just texted me , ”
47160	47166	47157	47157	I	0	“ Perhaps I should have . ”
47173	47182	47167	47167	He	45	“ Have a good day , Miss Davis . ”
47183	47190	47157	47157	I	0	“ You too , Mr. Calloway . ”
47216	47222	47203	47203	I	0	“ Good morning , boss . ”
47239	47247	47248	47248	I	0	“ What ’s so good about it ? ”
47251	47261	47226	47226	she	63	“ Whoa . What ’s your problem this morning ? ”
47262	47276	47226	47226	she	63	“ Why do n’t you ask , Kinsley , what her problem is ? ”
47277	47289	47290	47290	she	63	“ I ’m sensing the two of you had a fight , ”
47293	47352	47290	47290	she	63	“ I texted her last night and told her I was thinking about coming over . She said no and that she was n’t feeling well . I just stopped by her desk to see how she was feeling and she had an attitude . She told me I could have just texted her instead of walking over . ”
47356	47359	47353	47353	Lexi	63	“ Really ? ”
47365	47380	47360	47360	I	0	“ Sorry . She has n’t been feeling good . Cut her some slack . ”
47381	47391	47392	47392	I	0	“ Then she needs to go to the doctor , ”
47395	47409	47392	47392	I	0	“ That ’s not for you to decide . It ’s her decision . ”
47410	47428	47360	47360	I	0	“ She does n’t have to take it out on me because she does n’t feel good . ”
47429	47437	47392	47392	I	0	“ Just let her be , Chase . ”
47438	47445	47446	47446	I	0	“ Trust me , I am . ”
47619	47626	47627	47627	I	0	“ Excuse me , Mr. Calloway . ”
47635	47649	47627	47627	I	0	“ Come on in , Kinsley . What can I do for you ? ”
47650	47670	47632	47632	his	834	“ Is it okay if I leave early today ? I have a doctor ’s appointment at four o’clock . ”
47671	47677	47678	47678	he	834	“ Still not feeling well ? ”
47681	47696	47678	47678	he	834	“ No . I thought I was getting better , but I guess not . ”
47697	47702	47632	47632	his	834	“ That ’s fine . ”
47703	47716	47632	47632	his	834	“ I can come back to the office after if you want . ”
47717	47736	47737	47737	He	834	“ That ’s okay , sweetheart . Go get yourself checked out and then go home and rest . ”
47740	47744	47737	47737	He	834	“ Thank you . ”
47765	47778	47779	47779	he	45	“ There you are . How about dinner tonight at my place ? ”
47782	47789	47779	47779	he	45	“ Sorry , I ca n’t . ”
47790	47796	47749	47749	his	834	“ You have other plans ? ”
47797	47805	47835	47835	his	45	“ Yes . Actually , I do . ”
47806	47810	47779	47779	he	45	“ I see . ”
47811	47819	47820	47820	he	45	“ How about tomorrow night , then ? ”
47823	47830	47820	47820	he	45	“ I have yoga tomorrow night . ”
47831	47834	47779	47779	he	45	“ After ? ”
47841	47850	47851	47851	I	0	“ I ’ll be too sweaty and tired , ”
47854	47857	47851	47851	I	0	“ Okay . ”
47861	47873	47858	47858	He	45	“ You have all of L.A. to entertain you , Chase . ”
47874	47891	47892	47892	He	45	“ You ’re right . I do , Kinsley . I ’ll talk to you later . ”
47929	47946	47911	47911	I	0	“ Hello , Kinsley , I ’m Dr. Harrison . It ’s nice to meet you . ”
47947	47955	47956	47956	I	0	“ Nice to meet you as well . ”
47959	47972	47956	47956	I	0	“ So , tell me what ’s been going on with you . ”
47973	47991	47911	47911	I	0	“ I ’ve been sick to my stomach the past few days and I ’ve been exhausted . ”
47992	48003	48004	48004	he	45	“ How many times are you vomiting in a day ? ”
48007	48067	48004	48004	he	45	“ Two to three times . Usually in the mornings . When I get home from work , I ’m so exhausted that I feel like I need to take a nap . Yesterday , I slept for four and a half hours , got up , changed into my pajamas , and went to bed for the night . ”
48068	48074	48075	48075	he	45	“ Are you sexually active ? ”
48078	48081	48075	48075	he	45	“ Yes . ”
48092	48102	48082	48082	I	0	“ Is there a chance you could be pregnant ? ”
48117	48192	48082	48082	I	0	“ No . We ’ve been using protection . There was this one time over a month ago where the condom broke , but I went the next morning and took the morning after pill . So no , I ca n’t be pregnant . I was on the pill three months ago , but since I moved here , I had n’t gotten them refilled because I needed to see a doctor first . ”
48193	48209	48210	48210	he	45	“ Okay . We ’ll draw some blood first and then I ’ll examine you , ”
48312	48347	48310	48310	Chase	45	“ I was just in a meeting with my dad and he told me you had to leave for a doctor ’s appointment . How did it go ? What did the doctor say ? ”
48401	48411	48412	48412	He	45	“ I got your test results back , Kinsley . ”
48417	48420	48412	48412	He	45	“ And ? ”
48421	48426	48396	48397	Dr. Harrison	116	“ You ’re pregnant . ”
48427	48459	48412	48412	He	45	“ I ’m sorry , Dr. Harrison , but I ca n’t be . I took the morning after pill . That ’s what it ’s for , to prevent pregnancy . ”
48460	48486	48412	48412	He	45	“ Only if you have n’t already ovulated . It takes a while for your body to get back on track after stopping the pill . ”
48487	48490	48396	48397	Dr. Harrison	116	“ Great . ”
48498	48503	48504	48504	he	45	“ You have options , ”
48507	48523	48504	48504	he	45	“ I know I do , but an abortion is n’t an option for me . ”
48524	48594	48412	48412	He	45	“ I ’m happy to hear that . I ’m going to give you the name and number of an obstetrician . She ’s very good and used to be a colleague of mine . Her office is up on the third floor . Give her a call in the morning and set up an appointment . You ’ll need to start your prenatal care as soon as possible . ”
48595	48601	48504	48504	he	45	“ Thanks , Dr. Harrison . ”
48848	48862	48863	48863	Chase	46	“ I asked you a question and I do n’t appreciate being ignored , ”
48866	48886	48863	48863	Chase	46	“ Sorry . I just got home . I have a virus , just like I thought I did . ”
48887	48905	48914	48914	him	46	“ At least you found out what ’s wrong . If you need anything , text me . ”
48906	48909	48910	48910	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
49042	49049	49050	49050	I	0	“ Lexi , in my office , ”
49057	49065	49050	49050	I	0	“ You do n’t have to shout . ”
49066	49075	49076	49076	She	854	“ Shut the door and have a seat . ”
49090	49093	49094	49094	I	0	“ Please , ”
49097	49110	49094	49094	I	0	“ Do you know what the hell is going on with Kinsley ? ”
49111	49117	49050	49050	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
49118	49142	49094	49094	I	0	“ She has n’t had sex with me in over a week . She ’s been telling me no and her attitude sucks . ”
49143	49156	49157	49157	she	854	“ Maybe she does n’t want to have sex with you anymore , ”
49160	49163	49157	49157	she	854	“ Impossible . ”
49172	49184	49164	49164	I	0	“ Is she seeing someone and you ’re not telling me ? ”
49192	49224	49185	49185	I	0	“ Not that I know of . If she was , I ’m pretty sure she ’d tell me . We went to yoga class last night and she was fine . ”
49225	49238	49157	49157	she	854	“ None of this makes sense . I did n’t do anything . ”
49239	49250	49251	49251	She	854	“ Maybe she ’s letting your relationship of convenience fade . ”
49256	49303	49251	49251	She	854	“ And why is this bothering you ? You were going to do the same damn thing to her . So you should be happy she ’s behaving like this . It lets you off the douchebag hook . Why do n’t you just ask her ? ”
49304	49320	49253	49253	her	854	“ I guess I ’ll have to , and she will tell me the truth . ”
49321	49336	49337	49337	I	0	“ Be careful , Chase . You might not want to hear the truth . ”
49389	49398	49399	49399	she	857	“ What are you doing here , Chase ? ”
49407	49426	49427	49427	I	0	“ We need to talk and you ’re going to tell me what the hell your problem is , ”
49534	49541	49542	49542	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
49545	49609	49542	49542	I	0	“ You have been unbearable . You do n’t want to see me , you wo n’t have sex with me , and whenever I try to talk to you , you act like you hate me . What the fuck did I do to you ? Because if I did something , I sure as hell have no clue what it was . ”
49610	49629	49676	49676	I	0	“ I just think it ’s best that we do n’t see each other anymore outside of work . ”
49630	49635	49676	49676	I	0	“ And why not ? ”
49636	49639	49542	49542	I	0	“ Because . ”
49640	49654	49655	49655	he	865	“ Damn it , Kinsley . ‘ Because ’ is n’t an answer ! ”
49666	49675	49676	49676	I	0	“ Is n’t this exactly what you wanted ? ”
49680	49689	49676	49676	I	0	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
49690	49720	49542	49542	I	0	“ I overheard your conversation with Lexi in your office . The one about us getting too close and how you were going to let things fade between us . ”
49721	49726	49676	49676	I	0	“ You heard that ? ”
49727	49733	49676	49676	I	0	“ Yes , I did . ”
49734	49759	49760	49760	He	865	“ You knew I could n’t be anything more than just a sexual partner with you . I told you that from the start ! ”
49765	49780	49760	49760	He	865	“ And you agreed . You said you were n’t looking for anything else . ”
49781	49785	49786	49786	I	0	“ Oh no . ”
49793	49815	49786	49786	I	0	“ You are n’t putting the blame on me . I never once hinted to you that I wanted anything more . ”
49816	49831	49832	49832	he	865	“ I ’m not going to stand here and argue about this with you , ”
49836	49932	49933	49933	I	0	“ Of course you ’re not , because you ’re the one with the issues . So anti - relationship . Scared to death to get involved with someone for one reason or another . Have to sleep with every woman you lay eyes on and do n’t give a damn how bad you hurt them . You walk around L.A. like you ’re God ’s greatest gift to the world , but in reality , you ’re just a scared little boy trapped inside a man ’s body hiding behind all your mommy issues ! ”
49948	49975	49976	49976	he	865	“ You do n’t know a damn thing about my mother , and how dare you say that to me . I ’m done with you ! ”
49986	49989	49979	49979	he	865	“ Done ! ”
50003	50008	50009	50009	I	0	“ I ’m pregnant , ”
50024	50031	50016	50016	He	865	“ What did you just say ? ”
50032	50037	50016	50016	He	865	“ I ’m pregnant . ”
50038	50043	50044	50044	he	865	“ Is it mine ? ”
50053	50069	50044	50044	he	865	“ Of course it ’s yours . You ’re the only man I slept with . ”
50112	50119	50120	50120	he	865	“ When did you find out ? ”
50127	50137	50120	50120	he	865	“ Last week when I went to the doctor . ”
50138	50149	50120	50120	he	865	“ You told me he said it was a virus . ”
50150	50168	50120	50120	he	865	“ I was in shock and I was trying to figure out a way to tell you . ”
50169	50175	50120	50120	he	865	“ Are you keeping it ? ”
50176	50184	50120	50120	he	865	“ Yes . I ’m keeping it . ”
50185	50217	50120	50120	he	865	“ I do n’t want to be a father , Kinsley . Not now , not ever . Fuck ! How did this happen ? You took the morning after pill . ”
50218	50226	50120	50120	he	865	“ Apparently , I had already ovulated . ”
50227	50236	50237	50237	He	865	“ I ca n’t believe this is happening . ”
50245	50306	50237	50237	He	865	“ Me either . But it is . I ’ve thought a lot the past week and nobody will ever know you ’re the father . So , you do n’t have to worry about your precious reputation . I ’m going to raise this baby alone and I ’ll have papers drawn up relinquishing you of your parental rights . ”
50307	50313	50314	50314	he	865	“ You ’d do that ? ”
50318	50321	50314	50314	he	865	“ Yes . ”
50322	50339	50120	50120	he	865	“ And what are you going to tell people when they ask who the father is ? ”
50340	50355	50237	50237	He	865	“ I ’ll tell them I had a one - night stand with someone . ”
50356	50381	50237	50237	He	865	“ I can give you a lump sum of money . You wo n’t have to worry about not being able to support it . ”
50382	50425	50120	50120	he	865	“ I do n’t want anything from you , Chase , and I certainly do n’t want your money . I ’m going to raise this baby by myself and I ’ll make it work like I ’ve done my whole life . ”
50426	50436	50437	50437	he	866	“ Are you sure this is what you want ? ”
50440	50466	50437	50437	he	866	“ Yes . This baby did n’t ask to be created and I sure as hell am not turning my back on him or her . ”
50467	50482	50120	50120	he	865	“ I hope you understand that I ca n’t be a part of this . ”
50483	50501	50120	50120	he	865	“ I do understand , and I do n’t want you to be a part of this . ”
50502	50518	50519	50519	He	866	“ Okay . As long as we ’re in agreement . I have to go . ”
50723	50734	50735	50735	I	0	“ Why ? Why are you doing this to me ? ”
50746	50795	50796	50796	I	0	“ You know how I am . You know I run and you know I never let myself get involved . I forgave you years ago after she left me . I thought that was my ultimate punishment . But now this ? Why would you do that ? ”
50801	50850	50796	50796	I	0	“ The kid did n’t ask for this and he or she certainly did n’t ask for me to be its father . Is this another punishment for the way I live my life ? Because if it is , you ’ve really outdone yourself on this one . ”
51027	51034	51045	51045	she	881	“ What is it , Lexi ? ”
51035	51041	51045	51045	she	881	“ It ’s not Lexi , ”
51050	51056	51045	51045	she	881	“ She ’s at lunch . ”
51057	51065	51045	51045	she	881	“ What can I do for you ? ”
51066	51076	51045	51045	she	881	“ I have the papers for you to sign . ”
51077	51080	51081	51081	I	0	“ Papers ? ”
51086	51094	51095	51095	She	881	“ The ones relinquishing your parental rights . ”
51101	51130	51095	51095	She	881	“ I hired an attorney and explained to him the situation . He said the courts could deny it , so he made sure everything was properly indicated . ”
51131	51135	51045	51045	she	881	“ As in ? ”
51136	51189	51045	51045	she	881	“ You ’re giving up rights to the child voluntarily , I agree , and that I want no money for support . There ’s a few other things listed . You ’ll see them when you read over the documents . You should have your attorney look at it as well . ”
51190	51203	51095	51095	She	881	“ I will . Thanks , Kinsley . How are you feeling ? ”
51204	51232	51045	51045	she	881	“ Tired , but fine . I just wanted to drop those off . I need to grab something to eat before my lunch hour is over . ”
51233	51242	51243	51243	She	886	“ Yeah . Sure . Enjoy your lunch . ”
51390	51393	51394	51394	I	0	“ Delilah . ”
51397	51415	51394	51394	I	0	“ Hello , dear . I brought over dinner . I hope you do n’t have plans . ”
51416	51429	51430	51430	She	893	“ Actually , I do n’t have any plans . Come in . ”
51453	51468	51430	51430	She	893	“ I made a chicken dumpling casserole and a fresh homemade loaf of bread . ”
51469	51483	51484	51484	I	0	“ Sounds delicious . That was so sweet of you to do that . ”
51496	51509	51510	51510	she	893	“ We have n’t had much of a chance to talk lately , ”
51513	51531	51510	51510	she	893	“ Plus , I wanted to check up on you and see if you were all right . ”
51532	51537	51538	51538	I	0	“ I ’m fine . ”
51548	51602	51538	51538	I	0	“ One night last week , I was going for a walk and I heard a lot of shouting coming from the apartment . Then , when I was on my way back , I saw Chase leaving and he did n’t look happy . I have n’t seen him back here since . ”
51603	51614	51510	51510	she	893	“ Chase and I are n’t seeing each other anymore . ”
51615	51631	51538	51538	I	0	“ I ’m sorry to hear that . You two made such a cute couple . ”
51632	51645	51538	51538	I	0	“ We were n’t a couple , Delilah . We were more — ”
51646	51651	51652	51652	She	897	“ Friends with benefits ? ”
51662	51669	51655	51655	I	0	“ You know what that means ? ”
51670	51692	51538	51538	I	0	“ Honey , I may be old , but I ’m up to date on what you young people do nowadays . ”
51693	51702	51703	51703	I	0	“ Yes . We were friends with benefits . ”
51735	51742	51727	51727	she	89	“ I ’m pregnant , Delilah . ”
51757	51775	51750	51750	she	897	“ Kinsley , that ’s wonderful news . Congratulations . I take it Chase is the father ? ”
51776	51790	51750	51750	she	897	“ It ’s complicated . He is , but nobody can ever know . ”
51791	51794	51795	51795	She	897	“ Why ? ”
51802	51860	51795	51795	She	897	“ He does n’t want the baby and he does n’t want to be a father . So I had papers drawn up relinquishing him of all his parental rights . I wo n’t force him to be something he does n’t want to be , because in the long run , it ’ll hurt the child . ”
51861	51876	51750	51750	she	897	“ That ’s true . I take it you know this from personal experience ? ”
51877	51880	51881	51881	I	0	“ Yes . ”
51891	51927	51928	51928	She	898	“ You ’re a brave and fearless woman , Kinsley Davis . You do n’t have to worry about me . I wo n’t tell a soul and I ’ll be here to help you . ”
51932	51943	51928	51928	She	898	“ Thank you . I know I can trust you . ”
51944	51953	51954	51954	she	898	“ He ’s frightened , that ’s all , ”
51957	52003	51954	51954	she	898	“ Whatever happened in his past has a grip on him and it wo n’t let go . I ’ve seen the way he looks at you and I know he cares for you deeply , even if he does n’t admit it to himself . ”
52004	52020	51928	51928	She	898	“ I do n’t think Chase Calloway is capable of caring for anyone but himself . ”
52021	52063	51954	51954	she	898	“ He is , and I think he would make a good father . But , as long as he lets his past consume him , he will never truly live up to being the man he was meant to be . ”
52064	52075	51954	51954	she	898	“ I know that . I just wished he did . ”
52090	52100	52081	52081	Delilah	89	“ Thank you for dinner . It was delicious . ”
52108	52126	52101	52101	I	0	“ You ’re welcome , dear . If you need anything at all , please call me . ”
52127	52131	52132	52132	I	0	“ I will . ”
52206	52219	52220	52220	I	0	“ Mr. Calloway , can I talk to you for a minute ? ”
52229	52242	52220	52220	I	0	“ Of course , Kinsley . What can I do for you ? ”
52261	52271	52272	52272	I	0	“ I do n’t know how to say this , ”
52276	52285	52286	52286	he	904	“ You ’re not quitting , are you ? ”
52289	52296	52286	52286	he	904	“ No . I ’m pregnant . ”
52309	52322	52297	52297	He	904	“ Oh . I ’m going to assume this was n’t planned . ”
52323	52330	52286	52286	he	904	“ No , it was n’t . ”
52331	52341	52297	52297	He	904	“ I did n’t know you were seeing anyone . ”
52342	52347	52348	52348	I	0	“ I ’m not . ”
52354	52363	52364	52364	he	904	“ May I ask who the father is ? ”
52377	52397	52364	52364	he	904	“ I had a one - night stand with a guy I met . I ’m embarrassed and ashamed . ”
52398	52412	52297	52297	He	904	“ Please tell me that one - night stand was n’t my son . ”
52413	52421	52364	52364	he	904	“ No . It was n’t Chase . ”
52422	52464	52364	52364	he	904	“ Whew , you had me worried there for a minute . Well , thank you for telling me , and if there ’s anything you need , just ask me . I will support you in any way I can . ”
52465	52472	52297	52297	He	904	“ Thank you , Mr. Calloway . ”
52485	52488	52473	52473	I	0	“ Kinsley ? ”
52489	52492	52493	52493	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
52497	52506	52493	52493	I	0	“ Do n’t be ashamed . Accidents happen . ”
52576	52581	52582	52582	I	0	“ Are you ready ? ”
52585	52591	52592	52592	She	63	“ Give me one second . ”
52599	52602	52592	52592	She	63	“ Kinsley . ”
52612	52615	52606	52606	he	46	“ Hi . ”
52625	52635	52636	52636	he	46	“ Are the two of you going to lunch ? ”
52639	52658	52659	52659	She	63	“ Yeah . We ’re heading over to the Chinese restaurant . Kinsley is craving their wonton soup . ”
52674	52684	52671	52671	his	46	“ Hey , why do n’t you join us ? ”
52691	52706	52685	52685	Lexi	63	“ Nah . It ’s okay . You two go and have girl talk . ”
52707	52718	52719	52719	she	63	“ Kinsley does n’t mind . Do you , Kinsley ? ”
52748	52755	52756	52756	I	0	“ No . Not at all , ”
52759	52764	52765	52765	he	46	“ Are you sure ? ”
52769	52778	52765	52765	he	46	“ Why not ? The more the merrier . ”
52907	52912	52913	52913	I	0	“ I ’m pregnant , ”
52923	52927	52928	52928	Lexi	63	“ What ? ! ”
52946	52949	52936	52936	She	63	“ Is — ”
52950	52953	52954	52954	I	0	“ No . ”
52959	52966	52967	52967	she	63	“ Did you know about this ? ”
52971	52983	52984	52984	he	46	“ No . I ’m just as shocked as you are , ”
52987	52995	52996	52996	Lexi	63	“ Kinsley , who ’s the father ? ”
52999	53034	52996	52996	Lexi	63	“ I had a one - night stand with some guy I met while running on the beach . We talked , went out for a couple of drinks , and it just happened . ”
53035	53046	53047	53047	she	63	“ Why did n’t you tell me about this guy ? ”
53052	53092	53047	53047	she	63	“ Because I was ashamed , and I did n’t want you to think any less of me . It happened one time . He was from out of state . I did n’t even get his last name . ”
53112	53120	53121	53121	She	63	“ Did you know about this guy ? ”
53128	53142	53123	53123	her	63	“ No . Kinsley , I must say I ’m a little shocked . ”
53149	53157	53158	53158	Lexi	63	“ What are you going to do ? ”
53161	53181	53158	53158	Lexi	63	“ I ’m having the baby and I ’ll raise him or her alone . I can do it . ”
53185	53225	53182	53182	I	0	“ Wow . I do n’t know what to say . Congratulations . You know I ’ll be here to help you every step of the way and I ’m sure Chase will be too . Right , Chase ? ”

53249	53256	53257	53257	Lexi	63	“ Did you tell Mr. Calloway ? ”
53260	53267	53257	53257	Lexi	63	“ I told him this morning . ”
53268	53274	53275	53275	Chase	46	“ What did he say ? ”
53278	53294	53257	53257	Lexi	63	“ Not much . He told me if I needed anything to let him know . ”
53300	53308	53309	53309	Lexi	63	“ What happened between you and Kinsley ? ”
53324	53332	53333	53333	I	0	“ We are n’t having sex anymore , ”
53336	53339	53333	53333	I	0	“ Why ? ”
53340	53348	53312	53312	she	63	“ She overheard us that day talking . ”
53349	53353	53312	53312	she	63	“ Which day ? ”
53354	53374	53333	53333	I	0	“ The one where I said we were getting too close and I was going to let things fade . ”
53375	53387	53312	53312	she	63	“ Oh my God , why did n’t you tell me ? ”
53388	53394	53395	53395	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
53400	53421	53395	53395	I	0	“ I guess I did n’t want to talk about it . She said some pretty nasty things to me . ”
53422	53467	53312	53312	she	63	“ So that ’s why the two of you have n’t really been talking here at the office . I knew something was going on . I got really scared there for a minute . I thought you were the father of her baby . ”
53468	53479	53545	53545	her	917	“ Me ? No way . No way in Hell . ”
53480	53505	53506	53506	She	917	“ Yeah . That would be pretty bad if you were . I mean , you of all people should n’t be a dad . ”
53509	53513	53506	53506	She	917	“ Excuse me ? ”
53519	53523	53514	53514	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
53524	53539	53540	53540	I	0	“ Because you ’re selfish and the only person you can love is yourself . ”
53547	53550	53551	53551	she	917	“ What ? ”
53554	53572	53551	53551	she	917	“ Are n’t you the one who goes around telling people that you ’re incapable of love ? ”
53573	53581	53545	53545	her	917	“ Is the Edwards file ready yet ? ”
53582	53585	53586	53586	she	917	“ Almost , ”
53589	53600	53586	53586	she	917	“ Then get back to your desk and finish it ! ”
53601	53618	53619	53619	She	917	“ Yes , sir . I ’m not telling you anything you do n’t already know . ”
53704	53739	53702	53702	Kinsley	59	“ Hey , sorry to bother you , but I want to know if you signed the papers yet ? I have to get them back to my attorney so we can finalize this . ”
53740	53765	53796	53796	Kinsley	59	“ Not yet . I ’ve been really busy with a new project . I ’ll sign them and give them back to you . ”

53878	53894	53855	53856	Darius Cole	52	“ I ’m good . Thanks . I need a favor from you , buddy . ”
53895	53901	53855	53856	Darius Cole	52	“ Of course . Anything . ”
53902	53935	53843	53843	I	0	“ I need you to dig up some information on a woman named Kinsley Davis from Berkshire , Indiana . I need an address , friends , where she worked , etc . ”
53936	53947	53855	53856	Darius Cole	52	“ Sure . Let me see what I can find . ”
53948	53951	53952	53952	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
54105	54115	54116	54116	She	63	“ Hi , Kinsley , I ’m Doctor Morgan . ”

54137	54163	54131	54131	I	0	“ I ’m going to have you lie down and I want to do a quick ultrasound just to verify how many weeks you are . ”
54182	54191	54168	54168	she	63	“ I ’m going to turn this up . ”
54195	54199	54200	54200	She	63	“ See this ? ”
54211	54219	54200	54200	She	63	“ This is your baby ’s heartbeat . ”
54232	54235	54236	54236	I	0	“ Wow , ”
54239	54247	54236	54236	I	0	“ You ’re about eight weeks pregnant . ”
54263	54289	54290	54290	She	63	“ I ’m going to start you on prenatal vitamins and you are to take one starting today . I see here you ’re single . ”
54296	54302	54290	54290	She	63	“ Yes . I am . ”
54303	54310	54311	54311	She	63	“ And the baby ’s father ? ”
54316	54324	54311	54311	She	63	“ He ’s not in the picture . ”
54325	54330	54331	54331	She	63	“ That ’s okay . ”
54334	54372	54331	54331	She	63	“ Try to live a stress - free life during this pregnancy . Of course , I do n’t have to tell you that stress is n’t good for you or your baby . Are you active ? ”
54373	54388	54311	54311	She	63	“ I run every morning at least three miles and I take yoga classes . ”
54389	54428	54429	54429	She	63	“ Good . Keep it up . You want to keep your body as healthy as possible . Continue with the yoga as well . It will help keep your stress to a minimum and keep you centered . ”
54474	54477	54478	54478	He	46	“ Hey . ”

54802	54813	54799	54799	I	0	“ If you ’re not the father , who is ? ”
54814	54826	54866	54866	I	0	“ Some guy she had a one - night stand with . ”
54827	54849	54850	54850	Steven	69	“ Hell , had I known she was sleeping with someone other than you , I would have fucked her myself . ”
54853	54865	54850	54850	Steven	69	“ I would love to put my cock inside that beauty . ”
54881	54908	54909	54909	I	0	“ I bet that sexy mouth of hers could suck a dick like no other . You would know , Chase . Give us the details . ”

55112	55119	55120	55120	he	55	“ I somehow already knew that , ”
55123	55156	55120	55120	he	55	“ I told her that I did n’t want to be a father and I could n’t , so she had papers drawn up for me to sign relinquishing my parental rights . ”
55166	55172	55173	55173	he	55	“ Did you sign them ? ”

55193	55287	55173	55173	he	55	“ I think you do know , but you ’re so scared that you ca n’t admit it to yourself . I ’ve known you a long time , Chase , and I ’ve never seen you like you are when you ’re with Kinsley . Yeah , you were friends and fuck buddies , but I know it went beyond that . I think you need to talk to someone , like a therapist . There ’s nothing wrong with that . They ’ll be able to help you see things clearer . ”
55288	55320	55329	55329	his	946	“ Maybe . Listen , please do n’t tell anyone what I told you . Kinsley and I had an agreement that no one would ever know I was the father . ”

55334	55397	55398	55398	He	946	“ But I will tell you something and I want you to listen to me very carefully . It does n’t matter how hard you are on the exterior , when you see your kid , you ’re going to feel something , whether you want to or not , and I ’d hate to see you live a life of regret . ”

56153	56171	56148	56148	she	957	“ We ’re acquaintances . I met her a while back and I wanted to say hi . ”
56172	56214	56118	56118	She	957	“ Kinsley never told me she met anyone . Especially someone who looks like you . We used to be best friends , but she up and left town a few months ago . Nobody knows where she went off to . ”

56240	56248	56118	56118	She	957	“ He was asking me about Kinsley . ”
56249	56277	56118	56118	She	957	“ Kinsley ? If you see her , tell her she ’s fired . That bitch was the only waitress I had scheduled and she never showed . ”
56278	56290	56219	56225	the fat man in behind the counter	968	“ Well , I ca n’t say that I blame her . ”

56547	56604	56499	56499	he	972	“ I ’m an acquaintance of hers . We met a while back . Actually , it was in this diner when I was passing through town . She was my waitress and I found her to be really nice . She told me to stop and say hi if I ever passed through here again . ”
56605	56617	56618	56618	he	974	“ Well , she ’s not here . She left town , ”
56621	56638	56618	56618	he	974	“ That ’s what your girlfriend said . I guess I ’ll be on my way . ”

56800	56818	56749	56749	her	380	“ Damn . I was really hoping to see her . May I come in and wait ? ”
56819	56825	56826	56826	She	380	“ You can come in . ”
56832	56862	56826	56826	She	380	“ But you ’ll be waiting an awful long time . She left town a couple of months ago . I have n’t heard from or seen her since . ”
56873	56885	56826	56826	She	380	“ Can I offer you a drink ? ’ she asked . “
56894	56900	56826	56826	She	380	” I arched my brow . “

So , I walked down the hallway and looked into the first room on the left . That was when I saw Beatrice lying on her bed , the floppy - eared pink bunny Kinsley found in the street one day when she was eight years old . I remembered her telling me about it one night while we were lying in bed . She said that when she found her , she was covered in dirt and mud , so she brought her home , threw her in the washer , and when she pulled her out , she looked brand new . She told me that her biggest regret was forgetting to pack her when she left , so I grabbed her and left the house . I was going to stay one more night , but I could n’t wait to get out of this town . Plus , there was no reason for me to stay here any longer , so I drove straight to the airport . “

58012	58157	58008	58008	I	0	” I winked . I was hungry , so I decided to sit down in a restaurant and grab something to eat since that breakfast I ate was n’t very appetizing . How could one fuck up scrambled eggs ? I ended up at a place called The Brewhouse , which was right up my alley . As I was sitting in the booth deciding what I was going to order , I noticed a man , woman , and their baby sitting at the table next to me . The child was crying , and the mother could n’t seem to quiet him down , so the father took him , and instantly , he stopped . I stared at them and watched how he handled his child . I could see the love pouring out of him as he made his child laugh .
58277	58284	58285	58285	I	0	“ Kinsley , it ’s me . ”

58487	58645	58478	58478	I	0	“ My mother and I were very close when I was a child . She was my world and I loved her so much . My dad was constantly working , and she was the one that was always there for me . We did everything together . She always put me first no matter what . Then one night , when she was on her way home from shopping with her friends , she was in a car accident and broke her back . I ’d never seen her in so much pain and it frightened me . The recovery was long and hard for her , so the way she dealt with it was taking more pain medication than she should have . Once she was fully recovered , she continued taking pain pills , which led to other drugs ; bad drugs . Right before my very eyes , she became a drug addict . ”
58646	58652	58653	58653	Kinsley	59	“ How old were you ? ”
58656	58864	58653	58653	Kinsley	59	“ I was eight years old at the time . My father put her in rehab for six months and we went and visited her once a week . She told me she was going to get better for me because she loved me so much and she hated me seeing her like that . She came home , and a couple of months later , she was back on drugs . At first , she hid it very well , but eventually , she spiraled downwards . She and my dad would argue every single day . Screaming and yelling at each other . I begged her to go back into rehab , and I asked her to do it for me because I loved her so much . I remember sitting on her bed one morning and her placing her hand on my face with tears in her eyes . She told me that she loved me so much and that she was checking herself back into rehab . She checked herself out after being there for a couple of weeks and I never saw her again . My father tried for a year to find her , gave up , and filed for divorce . ”
58865	58868	58869	58869	she	1016	“ Chase , ”
58873	58879	58869	58869	she	1016	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
58880	59060	59061	59061	I	0	“ I isolated myself and that was when I started coding and working on programs . It was a distraction from thinking about her . I was so angry that she would do that to me and I could n’t understand why . She said she loved me . You are n’t supposed to do that to the people you love , especially your own child . My dad ended up marrying Greta , one of my stepmothers . She was kind and accepted me as her very own . She was my substitute mom and I loved her . A couple years after they were married , she was diagnosed with stage four uterine cancer , which quickly spread to other parts of her body , and she died within three months . My father could n’t stand to be alone , so he married three more times . Things never worked out and they would divorce . I would never get close to any of them , because if I did , I knew they ’d leave . ”
59081	59154	59155	59155	She	1017	“ You were right about me being a scared little boy and hiding behind my mommy issues . It seemed like everyone I loved left , so I made a promise to myself never to get close to someone , out of fear they ’d eventually leave . I could n’t take the heartbreak . That ’s why I live the way I do . It ’s easier for me that way . ”
59165	59176	59155	59155	She	1017	“ I ’m sorry you had to go through that . ”
59177	59252	59160	59160	her	1017	“ When you told me about the note you left your mom , it struck something inside me . That ’s why I said the things I did to you . And the reason I got so angry was because you ’re different from any other woman I ’ve ever met . I ca n’t explain it , Kinsley , but you ’ve brought out feelings in me that I never wanted to have . ”
59253	59256	59257	59257	she	1018	“ Chase , ”
59261	59324	59257	59257	she	1018	“ Let me finish . I really like you , Kinsley , and I have since the day I met you . Like I said , you ’re different from anyone I ’ve ever met , and I want to be a part of your life and our baby ’s life . I ’m not going to abandon either one of you . ”

59348	59370	59371	59371	I	0	“ That ’s all it is ; a title . And now it can be changed to L.A. ’s sexiest daddy . ”

59710	59743	59704	59704	Kinsley	59	“ You do n’t have to say it . I ca n’t believe you went there . How is she ? You did n’t tell her where I was , did you ? ”
59744	59782	59635	59635	I	0	“ No . I did n’t tell her . I did tell her that you ’re living the life you always wanted . She wanted me to tell you that she loves you and she misses you . ”
59789	59805	59786	59786	her	1020	“ She said you ’re a strong woman and she ’s happy you got out . ”

59837	59850	59816	59816	I	0	“ We had a brief chat and then she kicked me out . ”
59851	59854	59855	59855	She	1020	“ What ? ”
59858	59919	59855	59855	She	1020	“ I tried to be nice , but she hurt you and that hurt me , so I let her know what a lousy mother she is . And I quote , ‘ Who the fuck do you think you are coming into my home , dressed in your fancy expensive clothes , and talking to me like that ? ’ ”
59920	59927	59928	59928	She	1020	“ Oh my God , Chase . ”
59932	59946	59928	59928	She	1020	“ Can you believe she served me scotch in a red plastic cup ? ”
59947	59960	59961	59961	Kinsley	59	“ I ’m sure all three glasses in the house were dirty , ”
59964	60014	59961	59961	Kinsley	59	“ They were , but still . Does she have no respect for alcohol ? I also paid a little visit to that greasy diner you worked at . Also , a dreadful place . By the way , the fat man behind the counter said you ’re fired . ”
60015	60024	59928	59928	She	1020	“ I ca n’t believe you went there . ”
60025	60080	60081	60081	I	0	“ That ’s not all . Your ex best friend Krista was my waitress and your ex - boyfriend was sitting in the booth across from me . I walked over to him , grabbed him by his shirt , and punched him in the face . I told him it was from you . ”
60091	60097	60086	60086	her	59	“ You really punched him ? ”
60098	60106	60107	60107	I	0	“ I did . You ’re welcome . ”
60121	60125	60126	60126	she	59	“ Thank you , ”
60132	60147	60126	60126	she	59	“ He hurt you and he was n’t going to get away with it . ”
60168	60176	60153	60153	I	0	“ Are you sure you want this ? ”
60177	60183	60184	60184	He	0	“ I ’m definitely sure . ”
60187	60191	60184	60184	He	0	“ Are you ? ”
60199	60207	60192	60192	His	0	“ Yeah . I ’m definitely sure . ”
60235	60243	60244	60244	Chase	46	“ We have to tell my dad , ”
60252	60272	60247	60247	he	46	“ I know and I ’m not sure how he ’s going to react because I lied to him . ”
60273	60280	60247	60247	he	46	“ Do n’t worry about that . ”
60281	60288	60247	60247	he	46	“ What if he fires me ? ”
60289	60317	60247	60247	he	46	“ You ’re carrying his grandchild . He is n’t going to fire you . I think the best place to tell him is at the office . ”
60318	60321	60322	60322	I	0	“ Why ? ”
60331	60348	60322	60322	I	0	“ You do n’t think we should do it in private , like at his house ? ”
60349	60369	60247	60247	he	46	“ I think we ’d be safer at the office . We can tell him and everyone else tomorrow . ”
60370	60383	60384	60384	I	0	“ They ’re all going to be mad we lied to them , ”
60387	60394	60395	60395	He	46	“ They ’ll get over it . ”
60418	60423	60424	60424	Chase	46	“ Are you okay ? ”
60436	60447	60427	60427	he	46	“ I ’m fine . It ’s just morning sickness . ”
60448	60456	60457	60457	he	46	“ Do you do this every day ? ”
60462	60465	60457	60457	he	46	“ Yes . ”
60470	60481	60466	60466	I	0	“ Gee . How long is this going to last ? ”
60482	60491	60492	60492	I	0	“ Hopefully only a couple of more weeks , ”
60524	60533	60513	60513	he	46	“ Are you nervous about telling my father ? ”
60534	60540	60549	60549	he	46	“ Yes . Very nervous . ”
60541	60545	60546	60546	He	46	“ Me too . ”
60568	60574	60575	60575	He	46	“ Good morning , Sunshine . ”
60580	60585	60586	60586	I	0	“ Morning , Lexi , ”
60604	60619	60620	60620	Her	63	“ Good morning . Did the two of you by chance drive in together ? ”
60624	60628	60629	60629	Chase	46	“ We did , ”
60632	60646	60647	60647	He	46	“ We ’ll explain later . I ’ll be down in a bit . ”
60652	60659	60647	60647	He	46	“ Okay . See you soon . ”
60663	60671	60672	60672	Lexi	63	“ What the hell is going on ? ”
60675	60685	60672	60672	Lexi	63	“ Like I said , we ’ll explain later . ”
60736	60742	60743	60743	he	68	“ Good morning , Kinsley , ”
60746	60768	60743	60743	he	68	“ Can you come into my office for a minute . I want to go over a couple things with you . ”
60769	60776	60782	60782	him	68	“ Good morning , Mr. Calloway . ”
60787	60797	60777	60777	I	0	“ Oh good , you ’re both in here . ”
60809	60825	60801	60801	he	46	“ Not now , Chase , I ’m going over a few things with Kinsley . ”
60826	60834	60835	60835	he	68	“ This ca n’t wait , Dad , ”
60850	60858	60838	60838	he	68	“ What the hell is going on ? ”
60870	60879	60880	60880	Chase	46	“ You ’re going to be a grandfather ! ”
60884	60888	60889	60889	He	68	“ Excuse me ? ”
60894	60906	60891	60891	his	68	“ The baby Kinsley is carrying is mine . Your grandchild . ”
60907	60910	60913	60913	his	68	“ What ? ”
60916	60926	60913	60913	his	68	“ Kinsley told me you were n’t the father . ”
60927	60980	60891	60891	his	68	“ That ’s because I told her no one was to ever know . I was in a different place then and I ’ve come to my senses . Kinsley and I are going to have a baby , Dad , and you ’re just going to have to deal with it . ”
60981	60994	60995	60995	He	1030	“ I ’m so sorry I lied to you , Mr. Calloway . ”
61014	61026	61027	61027	he	1030	“ So , the two of you are in a relationship ? ”
61030	61036	61027	61027	he	1030	“ I believe we are . ”
61046	61050	61042	61042	I	0	“ Thank God . ”
61057	61060	61061	61061	Chase	46	“ What ? ”
61066	61076	61061	61061	Chase	46	“ Are n’t you going to yell or something ? ”
61077	61087	61088	61088	He	1030	“ Yell ? Why the hell would I yell ? ”
61100	61139	61088	61088	He	1030	“ My son is finally in a relationship , and with a woman whom I like very much , and he ’s going to be a father . This is the best news anyone could ever give me . ”
61140	61143	61144	61144	Chase	46	“ Well . ”
61147	61155	61144	61144	Chase	46	“ I ’m happy you ’re happy . ”
61174	61182	61183	61183	He	68	“ Welcome to the family , Kinsley . ”
61187	61196	61197	61197	Chase	46	“ We ’re not getting married , Dad , ”
61200	61219	61220	61220	He	68	“ Does n’t matter , son . Kinsley is carrying my grandchild ; that alone makes her family . ”
61228	61233	61234	61234	He	68	“ Congratulations , son . ”
61239	61258	61234	61234	He	68	“ We ’re going to have a celebratory dinner tonight . I ca n’t wait to tell Penelope . ”
61259	61290	61315	61315	his	68	“ Thanks , Dad . If it ’s all right with you , I ’m going to steal my girlfriend for a few minutes . We need to tell Lexi . ”
61291	61299	61300	61300	He	68	“ Yes , of course . Go . ”
61317	61330	61331	61331	he	68	“ Well , he took that better than I thought he would , ”
61334	61343	61331	61331	he	68	“ I think I ’m still in shock . ”
61363	61376	61377	61377	she	63	“ For the second time , what the hell is going on ? ”
61380	61389	61377	61377	she	63	“ Kinsley and I are having a baby . ”
61401	61408	61393	61393	he	68	“ It ’s about damn time . ”
61415	61421	61409	61409	She	63	“ What ? You knew ? ”
61436	61482	61433	61433	her	63	“ Of course I knew , you idiot . Do you think I ’m stupid ? You really think I believed that Kinsley slept with some random guy ? I ’ve been waiting for one of you to come to your senses and tell me . ”
61483	61490	61491	61491	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Lexi , ”
61494	61514	61515	61515	She	1035	“ It ’s not your fault , Kinsley . I know you were doing it to protect this idiot . ”
61522	61529	61530	61530	He	0	“ Will you stop hitting me ? ”
61535	61563	61530	61530	He	0	“ Anyway , I suspected the day we had that talk and I told you that you should n’t be a dad and you got all defensive . ”
61631	61638	61639	61639	I	0	“ Do you like it here ? ”
61647	61660	61661	61661	She	59	“ Of course . I love it here . Who would n’t ? ”
61683	61693	61694	61694	I	0	“ I want you to move in with me , ”
61703	61706	61697	61697	I	0	“ Really ? ”
61721	61758	61710	61710	she	59	“ Yes . Really . I want me , you , and our child under the same roof . Plus , I have some pretty awesome - sized bedrooms upstairs that would make a great nursery . ”
61759	61774	61710	61710	she	59	“ I would love to move in , but I signed a year lease . ”
61775	61790	61710	61710	she	59	“ Do n’t worry about that . I ’ll take care of your lease . ”
61791	61802	61710	61710	she	59	“ That ’s sweet of you , Chase , but — ”
61803	61807	61808	61808	I	0	“ No buts . ”
61813	61824	61808	61808	I	0	“ You ’re moving in here . End of discussion . ”
61825	61857	61858	61858	She	59	“ If I move in , then all my stuff will be mixed in with yours . I do recall a conversation I overheard where you had a problem with that . ”
61861	61895	61858	61858	She	59	“ I did n’t really have a problem with it . It scared me , that ’s all . But I ’m not scared anymore , Kinsley . I — I love you . ”
61904	61912	61913	61913	she	59	“ Did it hurt to say that ? ”
61919	61935	61913	61913	she	59	“ Not at all . In fact , it felt pretty amazing to tell you . ”
61943	61963	61936	61936	I	0	“ I love you , too , Chase . There ’s something I want to talk to you about . ”
61964	61979	61980	61980	I	0	“ Okay . Let ’s finish up here and we ’ll talk over dinner . ”
62019	62028	62011	62011	I	0	“ What did you want to talk about ? ”
62029	62039	62040	62040	She	59	“ I was thinking about taking some business classes . ”
62048	62051	62040	62040	She	59	“ Why ? ”
62052	62074	62011	62011	I	0	“ I would love to open up an antique shop one day and I feel I should have some business knowledge . ”
62075	62083	62011	62011	I	0	“ I see . An antique shop ? ”
62084	62110	62040	62040	She	59	“ When I worked for Mrs. Buckley all those years , I loved it . I loved the timeless pieces and the stories they told . ”
62111	62145	62146	62146	I	0	“ I can understand that . Are you going to be able to take some classes with working full time and being pregnant ? I do n’t want you to burn yourself out , ”
62151	62157	62146	62146	I	0	“ I ’ll be fine . ”
62161	62178	62158	62158	She	59	“ Okay , then . Tell me what you need , and I will help you . ”
62179	62192	62193	62193	She	59	“ Thank you , but I can do this on my own . ”
62198	62215	62193	62193	She	59	“ But I want to pay for your classes . At least let me do that . ”
62216	62243	62244	62244	Her	59	“ I have some money saved . Plus , if I ’m moving in here , then I wo n’t be paying monthly rent , right ? ”
62248	62265	62266	62266	I	0	“ Oh , my love , you will be paying rent . Just not with money . ”
62413	62418	62419	62419	Chase	46	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
62427	62435	62436	62436	He	46	“ These pants do n’t fit anymore . ”
62452	62481	62482	62482	He	46	“ You ’re starting to show , which means you are going to have to go shopping for some maternity clothes . We ’ll go together after work . ”
62486	62501	62482	62482	He	46	“ You have that client dinner tonight with your dad . Did you forget ? ”
62502	62512	62439	62439	he	46	“ Shit . I did . I ’ll cancel . ”
62513	62544	62482	62482	He	46	“ No , you wo n’t . This is a very important client and your dad needs you there . I ’ll ask Lexi if she wants to go shopping . ”
62545	62554	62555	62555	He	46	“ Good idea . She ’ll love to . ”
62558	62567	62555	62555	He	46	“ We should start thinking about the nursery . ”
62568	62573	62574	62574	I	0	“ We have time , ”
62577	62596	62574	62574	I	0	“ We only have five months . What if you deliver early ? We need to be ready . ”
62597	62613	62614	62614	I	0	“ We ’ll start talking about it after we find out what we ’re having , ”
62629	62637	62638	62638	Chase	46	“ What ? We ’re finding out ? ”
62641	62662	62638	62638	Chase	46	“ Yes . It ’ll be easier that way . Do n’t you want to know what we ’re having ? ”
62663	62686	62574	62574	I	0	“ I guess . I kind of like the suspense , though , of waiting until he or she is actually born . ”
62687	62699	62700	62700	I	0	“ Then I ’ll find out and wo n’t tell you . ”
62703	62733	62700	62700	I	0	“ And how are you going to keep it from me when we do the nursery ? Obviously , if it ’s a girl , you ’ll want pink . ”
62734	62749	62750	62750	I	0	“ True . Well , it looks like you ’re finding out with me . ”
62758	62766	62753	62753	I	0	“ And when are we finding out ? ”
62767	62780	62792	62792	he	46	“ In three weeks . Lexi wrote it on your calendar already . ”
62781	62788	62792	62792	he	46	“ Remind me to thank her , ”
62802	62811	62812	62812	I	0	“ Lexi , come in here , please , ”
62818	62825	62812	62812	I	0	“ What ’s up , boss ? ”
62838	62854	62829	62829	she	1046	“ Today is the day Kinsley and I find out the gender of baby Calloway . ”
62855	62862	62829	62829	she	1046	“ I know . How exciting ! ”
62863	62870	62829	62829	she	1046	“ Something ’s been bothering me . ”
62871	62874	62875	62875	She	1046	“ What ? ”
62880	62897	62877	62877	her	1046	“ I think Kinsley should tell her mom that she ’s going to be a grandmother . ”
62898	62907	62908	62908	she	1046	“ Have you talked to Kinsley about it ? ”
62911	62923	62877	62877	her	1046	“ Not yet . I wanted to get your opinion first . ”
62924	62962	62829	62829	she	1046	“ I do n’t know , Chase . From what Kinsley told me about her , I ’m not sure I ’d want her to know if she was my mom . Plus , you met her . ”
62963	62992	62877	62877	her	1046	“ I know , and believe me , it was n’t a pleasant conversation , but she is her mom and she does have the right to know . ”
62993	63015	63016	63016	I	0	“ Tread carefully with this one , my friend . I ’m not so sure she ’ll be open to it . ”
63033	63045	63019	63019	I	0	“ I just think someday she ’ll regret not telling her . ”
63046	63080	63016	63016	I	0	“ Maybe she will or maybe she wo n’t . That ’s up to her . Carefully approach her about it and if she starts to get all crazy , drop it immediately . ”
63081	63086	63087	63087	I	0	“ Thanks , Lexi . ”
63093	63110	63111	63111	I	0	“ It ’s time to go find out if I ’m having a son or daughter . ”
63179	63185	63190	63190	she	121	“ Hello , you two . ”
63195	63204	63206	63206	she	121	“ Are you ready to see your baby ? ”
63248	63271	63235	63235	I	0	“ Baby is growing well , and the heartbeat is nice and strong . Do you two want to know the sex ? ”
63286	63292	63277	63277	I	0	“ Yes , Dr. Morgan . ”
63293	63310	63311	63311	She	59	“ Okay . Let ’s go down to that area and see what we ’ve got . ”
63325	63331	63332	63332	I	0	“ It ’s a boy ! ”
63335	63349	63332	63332	I	0	“ You ’re right , Mr. Calloway . You ’re having a boy . ”
63354	63357	63350	63351	Dr. Morgan	121	“ Congratulations . ”
63374	63381	63382	63382	She	59	“ We ’re having a boy . ”
63385	63390	63382	63382	She	59	“ I love you . ”
63428	63434	63435	63435	he	46	“ What are you doing ? ”
63457	63463	63464	63464	I	0	“ Staring at our baby . ”
63471	63480	63464	63464	I	0	“ I ca n’t wait to meet him . ”
63481	63498	63499	63499	He	46	“ Me either , sweetheart . There ’s something I want to talk to you about . ”
63507	63512	63499	63499	He	46	“ What is it ? ”
63513	63525	63464	63464	I	0	“ I think you should tell your mom about the baby . ”
63526	63536	63537	63537	I	0	“ Why would you even say something like that ? ”
63544	63559	63537	63537	I	0	“ She has a right to know she ’s going to be a grandmother . ”

63575	63611	63612	63612	I	0	“ She does n’t have the right to know anything . She never cared about me . She did n’t take care of me . I took care of the both of us . Me ! ”
63620	63626	63627	63627	he	1054	“ Baby , calm down , ”
63641	63674	63630	63630	he	1054	“ No , do n’t tell me what to do ! You met her . You saw the environment . For God sakes , she gave you scotch in a plastic cup ! ”
63675	63711	63635	63635	his	1054	“ Please do n’t remind me of that . All I ’m saying is that she ’s your mom and she should know . It does n’t mean she has to meet him or anything . ”
63712	63719	63720	63720	I	0	“ And what about your mom ? ”
63727	63739	63720	63720	I	0	“ Do n’t you think she has a right to know ? ”
63740	63754	63635	63635	his	1054	“ That ’s different and you know it . My mother abandoned me . ”
63755	63788	63789	63789	I	0	“ And so did mine . She may not have physically abandoned me , but she did emotionally for years . God , I ca n’t even believe you would suggest that ! ”
63819	63824	63825	63825	He	1054	“ Kinsley , please . ”

63838	63861	63825	63825	He	1054	“ No , you ’re not . Obviously , you feel very strongly about it or you would n’t have mentioned it . ”
63862	63874	63875	63875	he	1054	“ How long do you intend to stay mad at me ? ”
63878	63892	63875	63875	he	1054	“ I do n’t know yet . Please , just leave me alone . ”
63965	64092	64093	64093	I	0	“ She never nurtured me . Whenever I ’d have nightmares , I would run to her room and call her name . She never responded . She would just moan and roll over . So I ’d climb into her bed and snuggle myself against her . She never knew I was there . I hated her for that . I was a child and I needed to be loved . And no matter what , I always took care of her . I cleaned up her vomit , and I cleaned up all her alcohol bottles that were lying all over the house . I resent her for all of it . So I ’ll be damned if she ever comes near my baby , ”
64096	64111	64112	64112	he	1058	“ Damn it , sweetheart . I ’m so sorry for even mentioning it , ”
64126	64143	64112	64112	he	1058	“ I ’m so sorry . Please do n’t cry . I should have known better . ”
64144	64158	64169	64169	his	1058	“ You need to understand that I ca n’t and I wo n’t . ”

64316	64336	64301	64301	he	69	“ Kinsley ’s looking great . You have what ? A couple more months left until the baby comes ? ”
64337	64346	64301	64301	he	69	“ Yeah . It ’s hard to believe . ”
64347	64354	64355	64355	he	69	“ I met someone last night , ”
64358	64361	64355	64355	he	69	“ Continue ? ”
64365	64394	64362	64362	I	0	“ Her name is Franny . I ran into her on the street and knocked a bag of groceries out of her hands . Food went flying everywhere . ”
64395	64406	64301	64301	he	69	“ I sure hope you helped her pick it up ? ”
64407	64468	64301	64301	he	69	“ Of course I did . I ’m not that much of an asshole . Anyway , I helped her pick everything up and carried her bags home for her . She only lived a couple of blocks from the store . Damn , Chase . I ca n’t explain it . The feeling I got when I met her . ”
64469	64484	64485	64485	I	0	“ You do n’t have to explain it . I already know the feeling . ”
64488	64531	64485	64485	I	0	“ We talked for a while and she gave me her phone number . Instead of going to the club last night , I went home and we talked on the phone for hours . I ’m taking her to dinner tonight . ”
64532	64537	64538	64538	I	0	“ Good for you . ”
64541	64547	64538	64538	I	0	“ It ’s about time . ”
64548	64581	64485	64485	I	0	“ Yeah , well , Alex grew up , you grew up , and I thought maybe it was time I did too . This single life can get lonely at times . ”
64582	64589	64590	64590	I	0	“ I know what you mean , ”
64615	64626	64627	64627	I	0	“ I ’ll see you at the office , bro . ”

64661	64666	64667	64667	She	59	“ I feel great . ”
64678	64712	64670	64670	she	59	“ How about we leave the office at lunch and go shopping for the nursery ? Dad is on a business trip and I ’ll just have his line transferred over to Lexi . ”
64713	64732	64670	64670	she	59	“ I ’d love to . But do n’t forget I have homework tonight that ’s due tomorrow . ”
64733	64748	64749	64749	I	0	“ I know . That ’s why I suggested we take a half day . ”
64786	64806	64807	64807	I	0	“ Good thing this shower is n’t small or else the three of us would n’t fit in here . ”
64810	64821	64807	64807	I	0	“ Are you saying I ’m fat , Mr. Calloway ? ”
64833	64847	64825	64825	she	59	“ No . But you are taking up a large amount of space . ”
64856	64873	64848	64848	I	0	“ Since I ’m so large , I guess we wo n’t be having sex anymore . ”
64878	64901	64848	64848	I	0	“ You would never do that . You ’re hornier than I am , and I did n’t think that was possible . ”
64902	64905	64906	64906	She	59	“ True . ”
64914	64929	64930	64930	She	59	“ I guess I ’ll just have to think of another punishment for you . ”
64933	64945	64930	64930	She	59	“ Punish away , darling . I look forward to it . ”
64949	64973	64974	64974	I	0	“ You can build multi - million - dollar programs and computer systems , yet you ca n’t build a simple little crib ? ”
64992	65018	64974	64974	I	0	“ I do n’t have to think about computer systems and programs . They come naturally to me . But this — this is ridiculous . ”
65019	65025	65028	65028	Lexi	63	“ Hello , anyone home ? ”
65034	65042	65043	65043	I	0	“ Upstairs in the baby ’s room , ”
65046	65056	65043	65043	I	0	“ Whoa . What ’s going on in here ? ”
65062	65071	65057	65057	She	63	“ Chase is trying to build the crib . ”
65072	65075	65076	65076	Her	63	“ Trying ? ”
65080	65102	65076	65076	Her	63	“ Listen , Lexi , this is n’t as simple as you think it is . This is some complex shit . ”
65103	65115	65116	65116	she	63	“ Oh , for God sakes . Give me those directions , ”
65131	65142	65119	65119	she	63	“ Kinsley , come over here . Chase , leave . ”
65143	65147	65119	65119	she	63	“ Excuse me ? ”

65195	65203	65204	65204	She	63	“ Go surf some waves or something . ”
65216	65225	65226	65226	I	0	“ Are you sure we can do this ? ”
65229	65234	65235	65235	She	63	“ Piece of cake . ”

65394	65412	65413	65413	She	63	“ Do n’t worry . I wo n’t tell anyone . I ’d hate to embarrass you . ”
65416	65434	65435	65435	he	69	“ Since you two beautiful ladies worked so hard , how about I treat you to dinner ? ”
65438	65448	65449	65449	Lexi	63	“ First of all , it was n’t hard , ”
65452	65466	65449	65449	Lexi	63	“ And second of all , dinner sounds great . I ’m starving . ”

65580	65598	65577	65577	He	69	“ That was nice of your dad to postpone their honeymoon until after the baby was born . ”
65599	65625	65520	65520	his	69	“ Yeah . He ’s pretty excited about his grandson . In fact , I think he ’s more excited than he was about me . ”

67901	67917	67869	67869	HE	1280	” His warm breath swept over me as his face was mere inches from mine . “

68117	68140	68145	68145	him	1133	” Dr. Finn spoke . After the contraction subsided and Dr. Finn left the room , Chase narrowed his eye at me . “

68286	68300	68282	68282	He	69	” I kissed Kinsley ’s forehead as she held him in her arms . “
68306	68312	68315	68315	he	69	” She smiled at me . “
68323	68365	68320	68321	a Calloway	1677	” I smirked . Kinsley and I took an hour and bonded with him before I had to make numerous phone calls to family and friends . I could n’t stop staring at him . He was so tiny and perfect . “
68374	68378	68367	68367	you	0	” Kinsley asked . “

68402	68492	68385	68385	I	0	” She smiled as she handed him over to me . As I stared at him , guilt resided inside me . If I had n’t come to my senses , I would n’t be here , holding this little life that we created . Kinsley changed me and the love I felt for her and him was overwhelming . He was my son and the thought that I was so close to not being a part of his life frightened me . * * * * Two Months Later “

Kinsley ’s classes started back up today and I did n’t want my son being raised by nannies or babysitters , so he came to work with me . Kinsley did n’t think it was a good idea , but I did . Plus , I knew my father would be thrilled to see him . “

She ’s smart , kind , selfless and the most beautiful woman in the world . She truly has the soul of an angel . She ’s the strongest woman I know , and she puts up with me , even though there are times where I would n’t put up with me . When we first met , I knew right away she was special . She was unlike any woman I ’d ever met , and to be honest , it frightened the hell out of me . The more I was around her , the more in love with her I fell . She opened my eyes to what life really should be . See , Christopher , I was too afraid to love anyone , and she changed all that . I ’m going to ask her to marry me because there ’s nothing in this world I want more than to call her my wife . I ’m really nervous ; I wo n’t lie to you , little buddy . I ’m so afraid that your mom , this magnificent woman who deserves everything in the entire world , is n’t ready or will say no . Neither one of us has ever brought up marriage . Maybe the thought never even crossed her mind . She seems content with the way things are and that ’s what worries me . I love her so much and even if she says she ’s not ready yet , it wo n’t change a thing , because I will wait an entire lifetime until she is . You ’ll see what I ’m talking about when you get to know her better . You ’re very lucky to have her as your mom . This stays between us , okay ? ”

70045	70054	70042	70042	he	45	“ How about we wait a little bit ? ”
