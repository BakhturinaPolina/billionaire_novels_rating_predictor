418	449	450	450	she	81	“ Should I have started with my ex taking credit for my work , then moved to the resignation ? Or is it best to open with the bartender bit ? ”
454	465	450	450	she	81	“ I think they ’ll love you no matter what . ”
484	489	495	495	He	85	“ Mom and Dad , ”
596	607	608	608	She	81	“ You say that because you ’ve never met them . ”
623	633	608	608	She	81	“ Maybe I should n’t tell them at all . ”

658	661	662	662	she	81	“ Uncle , ”
668	705	662	662	she	81	“ Older uncle . Either way , I have longer perspective than you do given that I ’m closer to the grave , and I ’m advising you to tell your folks what ’s going on . ”

1070	1081	1082	1082	She	81	“ I ’m surprised they did n’t ask for fingerprints . ”
1095	1118	1119	1119	Oliver	85	“ Adonis is gorgeous , but let ’s both admit he only loves me because of the liver treats I fed him . ”
1127	1139	1122	1122	he	85	“ His loyalty is easily bought . Like his owner ’s . ”
1140	1144	1145	1145	She	81	“ Truer words . ”

1743	1763	1764	1764	Bree	88	“ No , you wo n’t . You and Dean will probably run around naked the moment I leave . ”

3825	3830	3817	3817	He	80	“ Who was that ? ”
3851	3867	3843	3843	he	388	“ I do n’t know , sir . Would you like me to find out ? ”

4664	4671	4635	4635	he	80	“ Are you a good dog ? ”
4683	4693	4694	4694	He	80	“ There you go . Calm down , okay ? ”
4721	4728	4729	4729	he	80	“ I have shit to do , ”

5533	5548	5549	5549	Rachel	81	“ How could you give up a desk and nice clothes to work here ? ”
5638	5647	5648	5648	she	81	“ I hope this is n’t disturbing you , ”
5962	5970	5973	5974	her visitor	471	“ Oliver ? You home ? Adonis ? ”
5981	5989	5990	5990	Rachel	81	“ Why do n’t I get that ? ”
6044	6047	6048	6048	She	81	“ Coming ! ”

6344	6355	6332	6332	she	81	“ You ’re better today , yeah ? Sleep okay ? ”
6428	6451	6424	6425	The man	481	“ Typically , Adonis has had his walk by now , but I did n’t see you at the elevator , so … ”
6520	6530	6531	6531	She	81	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry . ”
6566	6591	6592	6592	Dog	105	“ I took him out at three in the morning , so I ’m not sure if he ’ll have to … you know . ”
6610	6623	6624	6625	The man	481	“ Do you bring your own poop bags ? Or do you … ”
6648	6659	6660	6660	She	81	“ You know what ? I ’ll just grab one . ”
6719	6724	6725	6725	he	481	“ Where ’s Oliver ? ”
6740	6762	6731	6731	she	81	“ You mean he did n’t tell you ? He ’s on a business trip . I ’m house - sitting . ”
6763	6768	6769	6769	he	481	“ You his niece ? ”
6791	6821	6788	6788	She	81	“ No , not at all . He ’s one of my regulars . Odd , right ? But we hit it off and he likes me , so … ”
6836	6844	6845	6845	He	481	“ I ’m not the dog walker . ”
6861	6868	6850	6850	Adonis	86	“ I ’m an upstairs neighbor . ”
6869	6881	6882	6882	Rachel	81	“ Oh . Oh my God ! I ’m so sorry ! ”
6919	6952	6912	6912	his	86	“ I suggest you find a way to keep him quiet at night while you ’re out . I work from home and I ca n’t listen to him bark for hours . ”
6955	6988	7030	7030	she	81	“ If I were anyone else , a noise complaint would be in your future . Oliver follows the rules . He would n’t like knowing you ’re breaking a big one . ”
7022	7029	7030	7030	she	81	“ No need to be rude , ”
7103	7106	7099	7099	She	81	“ oh ! ”
7278	7288	7266	7266	Adonis	86	“ You ’ll have to take him out now ! ”
7296	7310	7266	7266	Adonis	86	“ Do n’t blue - ball the poor guy after taking him halfway . ”
7359	7362	7363	7363	she	81	“ Fine , ”
7636	7641	7642	7642	he	80	“ That ’s stupid , ”
7713	7719	7720	7720	he	80	“ One of her regulars , ”
7811	7814	7815	7815	he	80	“ Whatever , ”
7841	7849	7850	7850	Fiona	108	“ Talking to yourself again , Tag ? ”
7929	7933	7934	7934	he	80	“ The blonde , ”
7947	7972	7934	7934	he	80	“ She ’s staying with Oliver . I think she works second shift . Can you let me know when she comes in tonight ? ”
7973	7980	7981	7981	Fiona	108	“ You mean spy for you ? ”
7987	7997	7998	7998	She	108	“ A little intel is not spying , Fi . ”
8006	8017	8018	8018	Rachel	81	“ Rachel Foster . Says here she is a bartender . ”
8023	8029	8030	8030	he	523	“ One of her regulars , ”
8100	8112	8113	8113	Fiona	108	“ I ’ll let you know of her comings and goings , ”
8116	8123	8113	8113	Fiona	108	“ Oh , and , Tag ? ”
8124	8129	8130	8130	He	80	“ Yeah , doll . ”
8145	8156	8130	8130	He	80	“ This would n’t happen to be personal would it ? ”
8164	8175	8157	8157	Her	108	“ She ’s Oliver ’s girl . You know better . ”
8176	8180	8181	8181	Nostalgia	110	“ I do . ”
8226	8240	8241	8241	Fiona	108	“ The dog has been barking nonstop . It ’s not like him . ”
8244	8276	8241	8241	Fiona	108	“ Ah . I bet he has separation anxiety . Whenever I leave my Pomeranian , Lola , she goes crazy . My dog sitter says she ’s inconsolable for weeks . ”
8277	8281	8288	8288	Fiona	108	“ Separation anxiety . ”
8282	8287	8288	8288	Fiona	108	“ Mmm - hmm , ”
8302	8351	8288	8288	Fiona	108	“ There are several things you can do to combat it . Some dogs need more exercise , others special treats . They even have these toys that are like puzzles you hide treats in to keep them busy during the long hours while the owner is away . ”
8352	8356	8357	8357	Fi	109	“ No shit . ”
8362	8366	8357	8357	Fi	109	“ No shit . ”
8382	8395	8375	8375	he	80	“ Where ’s the nearest pet store that would have those things ? ”
8396	8414	8288	8288	Fiona	108	“ I love Pup Paradise . They have everything , including services like grooming and dog massages . ”
8419	8430	8431	8431	he	80	“ Let ’s hope it does n’t come to that , ”
8434	8443	8431	8431	he	80	“ Get me an address , will you ? ”
8460	8471	8452	8452	Adonis	86	“ I ’m , uh , I ’ll be back . ”
8497	8501	8490	8490	Fi	109	“ Totally spying . ”
8557	8575	8578	8578	sweetheart	529	” Rachel asked the man as she put a cheeseburger and waffle fries in front of him . “
8584	8648	8649	8649	Bud	112	” He winked and her smile turned saccharine . The youngish guy was in jeans and a button - down , had blond hair and eyes that did n’t open all the way , and had been hitting on her all evening . And he was laying it on thick . She walked by Bree , who was cashing out another bar patron . “
8657	8661	8649	8649	Bud	112	” she mumbled . “
8665	8769	8649	8649	Bud	112	” Bree gave a quick nod . Neither of them questioned when the other one asked for a favor . Usually the patron took the hint if they double - teamed him . So to speak . The rest of the evening flew , and both Bree and Rachel considered themselves lucky they ’d escaped without swatting too many guys away . Almost everyone was on their best behavior . No crazy rush ( beyond the usual ) , so Andromeda hit a lull at midnight . Late for a first cut , but Bree could definitely handle the crowd if she left . “
8774	8787	8788	8788	I	0	” she said to Bree as she counted and separated the tips . “
8817	8924	8815	8815	Netflix	114	” Rachel spun the bills in her hand so they were facing the same way and put the stack on the counter . She kept her back to the bar while she did , even though she was n’t worried about being robbed . There was muscle at the door in the form of Lex , a college student earning tips while he went to CSU . He was nice , though . Had a girlfriend who lived in Iowa , and from what Rachel had seen , he was completely loyal to her . Maybe there were a few good guys left on the planet . “
8933	8948	8927	8927	I	0	” Rachel said as Breanna poured and delivered a draft beer to seat 12 . “
8967	8980	8981	8981	I	0	” Ones stacked in her hand , she smiled at her friend . “
8997	9009	8981	8981	I	0	” Bree laughed , a rich sound matching her mahogany hair . “
9023	9024	9012	9012	you	532	” “
9033	9099	9027	9027	I	0	” Rachel scrunched her face , realizing how ridiculous her reaction was to the guy . Yes , sure , he was attractive in a completely unique way . And yes , she had looked like a pajama - clad hobo and offered him a poop bag , but really , who cared ? She was n’t looking , and he clearly was n’t interested . “
9113	9129	9107	9107	Oliver	85	” Rachel continued explaining . Oliver ’s neighbor had been on her mind all day . “
9145	9146	9151	9151	he	387	” “
9155	9185	9151	9151	he	387	” Rachel decided to leave out the attractive qualities lest Bree take it as an invitation to imaginarily set her up with Mr. Tall , Tan , and Sexy . “
9190	9204	9186	9186	He	387	” Built like a brick shithouse , as hard as a brick shithouse . “
9220	9227	9229	9229	he	387	” There . That sounded generic . “
9276	9280	9271	9271	He	527	” And kissable . “
9292	9293	9282	9282	you	0	” “
9296	9297	9282	9282	you	0	” “
9304	9412	9413	9413	I	0	” Bree ’s face melted into a mask of sympathy . But for Rachel , the moment had n’t been that bad . Aside from worrying about her morning breath . Which , if the guy was as bland as Rachel had made him sound , would n’t have been embarrassing at all . Okay - looking guys were easy to relax around . Back in Ohio , Rachel ’s 140 - year - old dentist had retired and a youngish doctor had replaced him . A guy so attractive , she could barely think when she went in for a checkup . Dr. Moore . Purr . “
9425	9429	9413	9413	I	0	” Bree asked . “
9452	9489	9490	9490	Bree	88	” Rachel laughed dismissively , split the tips , and put her cash into a pocket . Then she paused , Bree ’s words wending around her brain until she practically heard them click into place . “
9492	9493	9490	9490	Bree	88	” “
9496	9516	9490	9490	Bree	88	” Bree answered , distractedly folding her three hundred dollars in tips and shoving it into her front pocket . “
9532	9565	9520	9521	the neighbor	549	” Because even though Oliver was a super - sweet guy , he was still older and … just no . That would be wrong . Bree shrugged it off and called , “
9569	9586	9520	9521	the neighbor	549	” as a bar customer climbed from his seat . Then to Rachel , she said , “
9605	9606	9609	9609	he	85	” “
9619	9620	9609	9609	he	85	” “
9624	9639	9642	9642	you	0	” Bree leaned against the back counter and crossed her arms over her chest . “
9645	9646	9642	9642	you	0	” “
9665	9693	9658	9658	Oliver	85	” Bree offered a shrug ; then her eyes went wide and her mouth dropped open . This time when she laughed , she slapped her thigh . “
9696	9705	9706	9706	Your	0	” Rachel watched her reaction , completely perplexed . “
9712	9718	9706	9706	Your	0	” Bree was still grinning . “
9723	9732	9706	9706	Your	0	” Rachel answered , making the duh face . “
9744	9754	9735	9735	honey	556	” Bree dropped a hand on Rachel ’s shoulder . “
9772	9773	9764	9764	you	0	” “
9787	9788	9789	9789	He	559	” “
9798	9799	9789	9789	He	559	” “
9802	9807	9789	9789	He	559	” Bree laughed again . “
9813	10173	9789	9789	He	559	” She walked to the other side of the bar , but Rachel stood frozen . Was that what he ’d thought ? That Oliver was one of her … clients ? Do n’t blue - ball the guy … A minute later , Rachel said goodbye to Bree , who greeted a group of guys at the bar and waved , then hailed a cab back to her temporary home . On the ride there , she thought about Oliver ’s gargantuan neighbor , how warm and hard he ’d felt . How obscenely good - looking he was despite the fact he had a mane of hair . Which she did not like , by the way . Some girls had a type , and she was one of those girls . She liked guys who dressed smart , not necessarily suit - and - tie , but fashionable . She liked men who had ambition . She liked men who knew how to live the good life . Drank espresso . Cared about thread count . As she made the mental list of qualities she liked in a man , they added up to Shaun . Which started to make her sad , then morphed to anger . Anger was a better emotion . Better to be pissed at Shaun than go down the rabbit hole of unanswered questions . Why did n’t he put me first ? Why was n’t he sorry ? Why did I ever introduce him to my parents ? Nope . No good answers lay down that route . But she could stoke the flames of a current anger . The one where the long - haired upstairs neighbor basically assumed she was a prostitute . Just because she was staying in Oliver ’s apartment and just because she kept late hours was no reason for the guy to assume the worst about her . Who did that jerk think he was ? She felt her lip curl ; then an idea hit her . She rapped on the glass separating her and the cabbie and gave him a different address . “
10190	10236	9789	9789	He	559	” she instructed . Rachel was sure Bree would n’t mind if she raided her closet . It was for a good cause . The mountain man thought she was a lady of the night ? Well , then that ’s what she ’d give him .
10320	10323	10324	10324	he	80	“ Tag , ”
10342	10348	10324	10324	he	80	“ How ’s it coming ? ”
10386	10390	10391	10391	Tag	80	“ My day ? ”
10397	10419	10391	10391	Tag	80	“ It ’s coming along nicely . I cracked open a beer and was about to settle in and watch television . ”
10420	10423	10424	10424	He	80	“ Taggart . ”
10442	10450	10451	10451	Alex	98	“ I ’m talking about the bars , ”
10454	10458	10451	10451	Alex	98	“ I know . ”
10514	10536	10537	10537	Alex	98	“ I ’ve been working on it all day , Dad . You suck at being retired , by the way . ”
10545	10557	10537	10537	Alex	98	“ Rhona says the same thing to me all the time . ”
10679	10694	10667	10667	Mer	119	“ I ask because I wanted to give you Howard Schiller ’s contact info . ”
10695	10702	10703	10704	Howard Schiller	120	“ Dad , I know Howard . ”
10749	10756	10738	10738	He	80	“ I have his contact info . ”
10757	10766	10703	10704	Howard Schiller	120	“ Then why are n’t you using him ? ”
10767	10776	10777	10777	Tag	80	“ How do you know I ’m not ? ”

13502	13508	13493	13493	He	80	“ Thanks , I guess . ”
13509	13517	13518	13518	She	624	“ You ’re welcome , I suppose . ”
13563	13570	13571	13571	he	80	“ God , she smelled good , ”
13585	13591	13581	13581	she	624	“ And she likes you . ”
13690	13720	13687	13687	Shaun	83	” Rachel ’s mom asked . Rachel stopped stirring the canned soup she was heating on the stove while Adonis stared a hole into the side of her head . “
13728	13748	13749	13749	Dear	126	” she told him . He looked forlornly at the dish of kibble , then back at the stove . “
13762	13852	13760	13760	Shaun	83	” Keri Foster said with real concern . Rachel froze mid - stir , phone to her ear , and realized she was going to have to take Oliver ’s advice and tell her parents what was going on . They did n’t know that ( a ) Rachel no longer was dating Shaun , ( b ) Rachel was no longer working in the marketing department at Global Coast , and ( c ) that Rachel was temporarily living with a dog roughly the size of a mule . “
13855	13867	13760	13760	Shaun	83	” She stalled , trying to think of what to say . “
13875	13876	13877	13877	You	0	” “
13905	13906	13902	13903	the sister	630	” “
13914	13923	13924	13924	Adonis	86	” What was that dog ’s damn name ? “
13926	13984	13985	13985	Adonis	86	” No sense in snaring herself in another lie . The Dane ’s head tipped in interest and he licked his chops . He chuffed , and Rachel shushed him . Her mother could n’t see him , but if she heard him , she ’d know Rachel was not sharing a house with a small dog . “
13991	14041	13985	13985	Adonis	86	” Clattering came from the background as her mother dug out what sounded like a metal pot . It was rare Rachel had a day off to make calls at dinnertime , but she ’d made an effort to keep up the ruse that she worked nine to five . “
14052	14072	13985	13985	Adonis	86	” Her mom had been asking for a few months . Rachel had put her off by saying things were “
14079	14083	13985	13985	Adonis	86	” Then another . “
14110	14125	14126	14126	I	0	” Another clang and bang sounded as her mom went for more cooking implements . “
14127	14140	13985	13985	Adonis	86	ask”—a chopping sound followed by Keri crunching a bite of whatever she ’d chopped—“because
14151	14152	14153	14153	Mom	634	” “
14157	14198	14153	14153	Mom	634	” She could n’t do this . Not any longer . It ’d been crushing her to keep the lies spinning like plates on poles . Rachel was an adult , and it was past time to take her medicine . “
14205	14239	14203	14203	dear	635	” The line fell silent and the words clogged Rachel ’s throat . Well . Take part of her medicine . She was n’t quite ready to tell her mom the whole truth . “
14247	14251	14242	14242	I	0	” A gasp . “
14260	14308	14203	14203	dear	635	” Rachel was quick to add to keep her mother from worrying unnecessarily . The truth was it was n’t fine , nor was it amicable , but Rachel had the benefit of eight weeks to absorb it and her mother had only had about eight seconds . “
14312	14320	14321	14321	I	0	” Her mother ’s tone was alarmed . “
14329	14346	14321	14321	I	0	” We were until he betrayed me like the punk ass he turned out to be . “
14355	14368	14371	14372	someone else	638	” she hedged , pulling the soup off the burner to cool . “
14374	14409	14371	14372	someone else	638	” For Rachel there was n’t . She had n’t been ready to jump into the dating pool after things went south with Shaun . Not after said pool tested positive for pond scum . “
14422	14457	14371	14372	someone else	638	” her mother was muttering . It was an investment . A big one for Rachel . She ’d loved him and had assumed they ’d get married . Until Shaun ’s familiar nighttime ritual “
14463	14466	14461	14461	Rach	128	” stopped and “
14468	14545	14371	14372	someone else	638	” replaced it . She wondered when he ’d stopped loving her . Had someone else grabbed his attention , or was it because of the guilt that he ’d accepted the boss ’s praise / promotion combo ? A preemptive strike before Rachel found out he ’d betrayed her ? After moving in with Bree and seeing firsthand what she and Dean had , Rachel started wondering if Shaun had ever loved her at all . “
14557	14581	14582	14582	I	0	” She tuned in her mom mid - litany about how sad it was to lose a future son - in - law . “
14586	14595	14582	14582	I	0	” her mom cut herself off to say . “
14624	14625	14626	14626	I	0	” “
14647	14669	14644	14644	her	641	” Yeah , saying she was living in another man ’s house would not sound innocent , even though it was . “
14684	14732	14644	14644	her	641	” Surely she ’d make enough money on this gig to put down the first month ’s rent and deposit elsewhere . From there , she would have to secure a job that paid more than cash tips in exchange for working until three in the morning . “
14736	14737	14644	14644	her	641	” “
14744	14750	14742	14742	Mom	82	” Finally , the truth . “
14753	14757	14758	14758	I	0	” Also true . “
14769	14773	14776	14776	she	641	” He woofed . “
14783	14784	14776	14776	she	641	” “
14797	14820	14821	14821	We	645	” She scrubbed Adonis ’s head , admiring his white - with - black splotched coat . He smiled , tongue lolling . “
14825	14826	14831	14831	he	640	” “
14844	14930	14831	14831	he	640	” At her mother ’s statement a pang speared the center of her chest . Rachel had been brokenhearted and had gone through it alone . Rather than share too much with Bree , Rachel had stayed busy . With work , moving , and getting used to her new bartending gig , it was n’t hard to distract herself . Now , in Oliver ’s silent apartment with only Adonis for company , she was feeling that uncertainty and pain from the breakup anew . “
14948	14949	14950	14950	Mom	82	” “
14954	14965	14966	14966	I	0	” She was not doing the check - in thing . “
14970	14971	14966	14966	I	0	” “
14976	14977	14978	14978	I	0	” “
14981	14982	14983	14983	I	0	” “
14987	14991	14983	14983	I	0	” Rachel said . “
15006	15015	15017	15017	Dad	84	” asked Keri Foster , master of manipulation . “
15020	15021	15017	15017	Dad	84	” “
15026	15034	15023	15023	you	0	” her mother said , giving up . “
15044	15045	15036	15036	I	0	” “
15052	15053	15046	15046	I	0	” “
15056	15060	15046	15046	I	0	” A sigh . “
15064	15103	15046	15046	I	0	” Rachel pocketed her phone with a smile . She loved her parents . They were the reason she was doing what she was doing . Her mom bragged to everyone who would listen about her daughter who was “
15106	15451	15046	15046	I	0	” in the big city . In the small Ohio town where Rachel grew up , Chicago was big time . So big , her parents had only ventured out her way twice in the two and a half years since she ’d moved here . She did n’t want to disappoint them , and while they may not be disappointed in her job as a bartender , they would definitely be more concerned and possibly offer to send her money , which she would flat - out refuse to take . If only they knew what her life was really like . Two days ago she ’d put on a ridiculously tight dress and boots , hell - bent on teaching her upstairs neighbor a lesson . Tag had seen right through her , and after she ’d clopped back into Oliver ’s apartment , she realized she was not surprised . She ’d felt more self - conscious than sexy wearing that getup , and she ’d witnessed how confounded Tag had been . He ’d backed away as she stepped forward . Not exactly the actions of a man who was interested . Not that she was interested , she thought , chewing on the side of her cheek . Maybe her mother had uncovered the crux of Rachel ’s bizarre behavior when she mentioned Shaun and heartbreak . Rachel did n’t feel like herself and had never , ever done something as bold as slink into a man ’s apartment wearing six - inch - heeled boots . It was nice of Tag to buy Adonis all of those toys , though . She took her mug of soup and a sleeve of crackers into the living room and placed them on the coffee table . She reached into the shopping bag , pulled out the stuffed squirrel , and squeaked it . Adonis ’s head cocked to one side and she threw the toy down the hallway . Adonis turned his head but refocused his attention on the crackers . “
15464	15488	15046	15046	I	0	” she said , giving up and handing over a Ritz . Then she ate one . Heaven . Buttery , salty heaven . “
15494	15723	15046	15046	I	0	” She finished her soup , sharing more crackers with Adonis , her mind on Tag and the way he ’d looked at her when she suggested that women liked to brush his hair . It made her laugh when she remembered it right afterward , and it made her laugh now as she washed the mug and spoon and put them into the dishwasher . Tag was ridiculously outside of her playing field , though , right ? He was massive , both wide and tall , had a thick but well - groomed beard , and longer hair than she ’d ever seen on anyone — male or female . She had n’t been far off with the Tarzan zinger , either . He looked like a trail guide in a jungle , or maybe a wrestler on television , grimacing and flexing until the veins in his neck popped out . She laughed aloud but it paired with her fanning her face . Because imagining Tag oiled up and shirtless … or sweat - covered in a safari outfit … Those were warming thoughts indeed . Two months was n’t that long to be without someone , but it was longer if she counted back to the last time she and Shaun had sex . She had done the math once , and the halting of “
15728	15878	15046	15046	I	0	” and the death of their sex life coincided . They also coincided with the hiring of a cute girl in the design department who had purple streaks in her hair . That chest - crushing feeling returned . Rachel had trusted him . With her heart , and as a friend . Shaun taking credit for her hard work was reason enough for her to end things . But there was a sting of embarrassment when she thought about how clueless she ’d been for so long . How much she ’d trusted him — how well she thought she knew him . Never could she have guessed underneath that neatly buttoned shirt and penchant for double espressos was a man who would step on her head as he climbed the ladder instead of lifting her alongside him . Adonis chuffed , snapping her out of her reverie . “
15888	15899	15046	15046	I	0	” she asked his gray eyes . He chuffed again . “
15907	15948	15046	15046	I	0	” He danced in a circle and she smiled . The apartment and dog were more than a step toward independence ; they were a step in helping her deal with unresolved feelings over Shaun . This time , for good .
16003	16012	16013	16013	He	80	“ Oh man . He ’s doing it . ”

17121	17128	17129	17130	The brunette	692	“ Oh really ? Sounds exciting . ”
17162	17177	17178	17178	He	131	“ I ’m married , father of two . Have you been married long … ”
17188	17201	17178	17178	He	131	“ Breanna , and no . I ’m engaged , not married . ”
17202	17212	17213	17213	Lucas	131	“ Do it if he ’s not a prick , ”
17217	17233	17213	17213	Lucas	131	“ He ’ll be in here later , and he ’s definitely not a prick . ”
17268	17277	17278	17278	Tag	80	“ You are rusty on the wingman game , ”
17302	17318	17293	17293	He	80	“ You , the married guy , should know to check the left hand first . ”
17319	17329	17330	17330	Lucas	131	“ I admit , that was a rookie move , ”
17333	17347	17330	17330	Lucas	131	“ But we ’d better get to it since you ’re probably behind . ”
17355	17360	17348	17348	Tag	80	“ Behind on what ? ”
17361	17378	17380	17380	his	131	“ I figured you and Reese split Chicago singles right down the middle , but with him engaged”—Luc
17386	17401	17380	17380	his	131	again—“that puts you in charge of sexually pleasing the remainder of Chicago ’s females . ”
17408	17414	17402	17402	Tag	80	“ You ’re an ass . ”
17415	17426	17380	17380	his	131	“ With great power comes great responsibility , my friend . ”
17504	17509	17510	17510	Breanna	87	“ Menus , guys , ”
17513	17518	17510	17510	Breanna	87	“ Are you eating ? ”
17519	17531	17532	17532	Lucas	131	“ Always . Look at these guns . We need protein , ”
17535	17542	17532	17532	Lucas	131	“ Breanna , tell me something . ”
17610	17623	17624	17624	Luc	133	“ Do you think my game is rusty or out of fashion ? ”
17627	17662	17624	17624	Luc	133	“ I admit , I ’m deliriously happy with my wife and have no desire to return to the singles scene , but it ’d be nice to know if I still had it . ”
17663	17666	17667	17667	Breanna	87	“ Hmm . ”
17701	17726	17678	17678	Tag	80	“ Your approach would work on me if I were single , but I ’m not sure you ’re everyone ’s cup of tea . ”
17727	17736	17737	17737	Lucas	131	“ I will take that as a win . ”
17742	17747	17737	17737	Lucas	131	“ What about you ? ”
17755	17765	17750	17750	her	704	“ Do you think your friend still has it ? ”
17766	17775	17776	17776	Tag	80	“ Well , I ’d take him home , ”
17815	17818	17819	17819	he	80	“ Fuck , ”
17826	17835	17819	17819	he	80	“ What is it ? The long hair ? ”
17836	17842	17843	17843	Tag	80	“ Chicks dig the hair . ”
17848	17867	17843	17843	Tag	80	“ Better watch it because her fiancé will be in here later . He might kick your ass . ”
17868	17889	17891	17892	his neighbor	706	“ I ’m not getting into a fight over a taken woman . There are plenty of available ones around . ”
17930	17942	17943	17943	Tag	80	“ I have n’t told you about my hot new neighbor , ”
17959	17971	17946	17946	Lucas	131	“ And my brief but memorable foray as a dog walker … ”
17976	17981	17985	17985	he	131	” Rachel asked Bree . “
17988	17999	17985	17985	he	131	” Bree wiped down the bar in front of her . “
18042	18162	18036	18036	he	131	” Rachel had the day off work but popped into the bar to drop off the dress she ’d stolen from Bree ’s closet . The bag was in her hand , and she had n’t yet brought up the fact she ’d borrowed her friend ’s clothes . In a plaid button - down , jeans , and boots minus the heels , by comparison Rachel was downright slumming . She had n’t slept well last night thanks to Adonis waking her three times to go out , so she ’d spent the day cleaning and doing laundry before crashing for a three - hour midday nap . As a result , her brain was chugging along groggily . “
18184	18191	18192	18192	He	708	” she said around a yawn . “
18196	18197	18192	18192	He	708	” “
18206	18207	18208	18208	He	85	” “
18239	18283	18284	18284	I	0	” Or maybe it was because the dog sitter Oliver typically employed had one job : dog sitting . Rachel had two , and being here forty - plus hours a week was putting a serious dent in her quality time with Adonis . “
18304	18333	18300	18300	You	0	” Bree leaned a hip on the bar . The Andromeda was in the middle of a lull , which was n’t surprising given it was nine o’clock . “
18342	18343	18334	18334	He	712	” “
18346	18357	18334	18334	He	712	” Rachel ’s eyes went wide as she looked around . “
18360	18444	18445	18445	I	0	” No way could she have missed him . He simply took up too much space . Tag was easy to notice . Like the time she ’d spotted him briefly outside of Oliver ’s apartment building . The sound of low , male laughter echoed off the adjoining room , and she turned around to see Tag and an attractive dark - haired guy standing at the pool table . The other guy held out a hand and she heard him say , “
18453	18454	18448	18448	my	0	” “
18461	18514	18457	18457	he	713	” Rachel whispered , trying to remember if she ’d mentioned she worked at Andromeda . She did n’t think so , but if she had , that would mean Tag had come in here to see her . Surely not . A ripple of excitement flowed through her at the thought . “
18523	18533	18518	18518	he	713	” Her friend ’s smile was shit - eating . “
18536	18568	18518	18518	he	713	” Rachel drew out the word , hoping Bree would believe her . Reaching into the Pup Paradise bag in which her dress and boots were being held , Bree asked , “
18576	18577	18571	18571	you	714	” “
18584	18594	18580	18580	I	0	” Bree shook her head and took the bag . “
18611	18620	18630	18630	my	0	” She stashed the bag beneath the bar . “
18638	18639	18640	18640	You	714	” “
18644	18652	18653	18653	I	0	” Her friend ’s eyes went wide . “
18670	18678	18663	18663	I	0	” Rachel bit down on her lip . “
18695	18696	18679	18679	I	0	” “
18704	18729	18699	18699	You	714	” Bree moved to the taps and pulled a beer . Then she gave Rachel a real smile as she filled a second glass . “
18747	18748	18749	18749	Me	0	” “
18757	18774	18749	18749	Me	0	” Rachel held up her hands in protest , and Bree put the beers into them . “
18792	18793	18794	18794	I	0	” “
18803	18804	18798	18798	He’s	720	” “
18817	18844	18811	18811	you	0	” Rachel thought for a minute . Not that she could n’t handle him , but … Yeah , kinda that she could n’t handle him . “
18867	18880	18865	18865	him	720	” She gestured said width with the beer mugs in her hands . “
18904	18910	18911	18911	I	0	” Bree ’s eyebrows lifted . “
18950	18951	18952	18952	Breanna	87	” “
18954	18958	18952	18952	Breanna	87	” Rachel hissed . “
18967	18997	18961	18961	You	87	” Rachel was saved by a couple who walked up to the bar . Bree shuffled off to wait on them , but not before she turned and said , “
19006	19156	19004	19004	Rach	128	” With a growl low in her throat , Rachel turned on her heel and headed for the pool table . Tag , in a low - slung man bun , was bent over lining up the cue ball . Rachel took brief inventory of his wide thighs decked in denim but quickly jerked her attention to his face when his dark - haired friend elbowed him . From his hunch over the table , Tag turned his head and pegged her with a look that was borderline animal . Then a bearded smile curved his mouth . He straightened , put the pool cue stick on the floor , and stood with it at his side like a staff . At that moment she realized her assessment of Tarzan was incorrect . He looked more like a Viking . Or a supersized Aragorn from Lord of the Rings . “
19173	19206	19164	19164	she	88	” Rachel lied . Because she had to have a reason for bringing him booze . She could n’t hover in the doorway while Tag pierced her with those fierce blue eyes . “
19211	19230	19207	19207	You	0	” Tag asked as she put the beer glasses on a narrow ledge along the wall behind him . “
19236	19257	19231	19231	You	0	” Disappointment sank into the pit of her stomach . Part of her had hoped he ’d sought her out . “
19261	19262	19231	19231	You	0	” “
19274	19301	19302	19302	I	0	” Well , she could n’t tell him she was dropping off the clothes she ’d gone upstairs to his apartment wearing , now could she ? “
19307	19308	19302	19302	I	0	” “
19314	19320	19310	19310	you	0	” Tag ’s friend asked . “
19323	19348	19310	19310	you	0	” Rachel sent a look from him to Tag . Tag shook his head , but his smile remained . She was missing something . “
19363	19380	19381	19381	You	0	” The friend held up his left hand and wiggled his wedding band with his thumb . “
19406	19426	19427	19427	I	0	” He snagged his coat off the coat rack — black leather — and slid his arms into it . “
19439	19450	19431	19431	you	0	” Tag said as his friend moved across the room . “
19463	19474	19475	19475	Lucas	131	” Then he leveled Rachel with a warm amber gaze . “
19485	19547	19548	19548	I	0	” He extended a hand and she shook it , noting his extra emphasis on the word finally . She apologized for her hand being damp from the glass . Then Lucas was gone and Tag and Rachel were in the billiard room by themselves . She put her hands in her coat pockets and gave the beer a dubious look . “
19555	19634	19548	19548	I	0	” She was n’t in any hurry to go home , but faced with the prospect of hanging out with Tag alone , she would rather leave . She thought of how Bree had challenged her a minute ago . Surely , Rachel could handle being in the same public place with him . Though , at the moment the small room felt more intimate than the night she went up to his house dressed in almost nothing . “
19640	19648	19636	19636	you	0	” he asked , interrupting her thoughts . “
19651	19685	19636	19636	you	0	” she answered . Whenever it was slow here , she practiced . And before then she and Shaun used to play at a dive near work . Where I used to work . “
19688	19712	19636	19636	you	0	case”—Tag did a neat little move where he lifted the pool stick and let it slide along his hand until the bottom hit the floor—“we’ll
19725	19844	19718	19718	I	0	” After putting away both pool cues , he came to her and held out a hand . It took her a few seconds to realize he was asking for her coat . She slipped the buttons through her black wool coat and handed it over , then watched as he hung it on the coat rack on the wall . The way he moved exuded strength and confidence . And the way he looked in jeans and a sweater … well , that was heat and sex and temptation personified . Too much . He ’s just too much . On his way back , he palmed both beers , dwarfing the drafts in his big hands . “
19852	19926	19850	19850	Dimples	125	” She blinked , taking in his earnest expression . Her entire life , she ’d never been called anything but Rachel or Rach . She tried to decide how she felt about the new nickname . Tried to call up her inner feminist and be properly offended , but she could n’t feel anything short of flattered . She accepted one of the glasses and Tag lifted his in a silent cheers . “
19934	19942	19928	19928	you	726	” she asked after taking a drink . “
19969	20027	19963	19963	friends	728	” He leaned a hip on the pool table . He was so … big . Dominant . Delicious . No , not delicious . He was not the same word she used to describe cheese - covered fries . He was something different . Something she was n’t cut out for . She could sense it . “
20036	20037	20040	20041	the girls	729	” “
20056	20065	20066	20066	You	731	” Tag ’s smile was self - deprecating . “
20070	20107	20109	20109	he	131	” She had zero doubts he ’d collected his share of phone numbers , and she knew exactly what it was about him that made her shy away . The boy was a Player . Capital P. “
20117	20275	20109	20109	he	131	” she asked , lifting her glass for another drink . He grinned and his expression was so blindingly beautiful , she lost track of what she was going to say . He took one step , then another . The closer he came , the more nervous she grew . Each step was purposeful , capable . Whatever he did in the hotel business , he sure as hell was n’t a maintenance guy . He smacked of power . Of commanding it . Of wielding it . An answering zing in her stomach sent a flutter of butterflies into her chest cavity . When he was close enough to touch her , he did , gently resting a palm on her shoulder . Warmth saturated her , sending those butterflies on a hectic migration through her limbs . He redirected his gaze to the dining room , but not until after he ’d started speaking . “
20284	20285	20109	20109	he	131	” “
20288	20338	20109	20109	he	131	” one of them answered . Rachel turned to see a pair of guys walk into the room and fish quarters out of their pockets . When she looked back to Tag , he was watching her with a quiet intensity that made her want to turn and run . “
20345	20349	20350	20350	We	733	” he said . “
20356	20356	20350	20350	We	733	”
20628	20633	20634	20634	he	734	“ You ’re single ? ”
20690	20694	20701	20701	He	734	“ Are you ? ”
20695	20700	20701	20701	He	734	“ I am tonight . ”
20731	20740	20724	20724	her	125	“ Do you always come on this strong ? ”
20741	20744	20745	20745	he	734	“ No , ”
20828	20845	20846	20846	Her	125	“ Adonis favors the toy beaver over the squirrel . What do you think that means ? ”
20863	20868	20860	20860	Tag	80	“ You ’re funny . ”
20869	20876	20852	20852	she	125	“ So I ’ve been told . ”
20914	20923	20924	20924	he	80	“ How long have you lived in Chicago ? ”
20927	20934	20924	20924	he	80	“ A few years . You ? ”
20946	20952	20935	20935	She	584	“ Lived here since birth . ”
20971	20977	20967	20967	she	584	“ Where do you work ? ”
20978	20982	20983	20983	he	80	“ Crane Hotels , ”
21028	21036	21020	21020	he	80	“ I run Guest and Restaurant Services . ”
21037	21052	21053	21053	She	125	“ Ah , then you can write this visit off , I ’m assuming . ”
21061	21072	21053	21053	She	125	“ Are you here to steal Andromeda ’s bar secrets ? ”
21098	21118	21093	21093	she	749	“ What ’s the deal , Dimples ? How did a businesswoman end up slinging shots in a bar ? ”
21155	21167	21168	21168	She	125	“ I … um . Did n’t like to dress professionally . ”
21331	21341	21342	21342	He	752	“ I do n’t believe that for a second . ”
21351	21359	21360	21360	She	125	“ That ’s all you ’re getting . ”
21377	21390	21360	21360	She	125	“ I ’m going to go . Thank you for the beer . ”
21391	21396	21397	21397	He	752	“ Taking a cab ? ”
21435	21438	21433	21433	Perfect	141	“ Yes . ”
21445	21455	21433	21433	Perfect	141	“ I mean , probably . It ’s snowing . ”
21456	21461	21433	21433	Perfect	141	“ It is snowing . ”
21500	21507	21508	21508	He	752	“ Nice night for a walk . ”
21530	21549	21508	21508	He	752	“ Give this to your friend . I do n’t need change . I ’ll grab our coats . ”
21550	21553	21554	21554	She	125	“ Tag . ”
21571	21586	21558	21558	her	125	“ We live in the same building . We ’re going the same direction . ”
21587	21598	21599	21599	she	125	“ I could be going to my boyfriend ’s house , ”
21634	21647	21648	21648	He	752	“ I ’m flattered , but not really boyfriend material , Dimples . ”
21709	21723	21724	21724	Bree	88	“ Hey , are you sure I can trust you with my girl ? ”
21727	21737	21738	21738	He	752	“ I ’m not sure I can trust her . ”
21757	21784	21754	21754	his	752	“ Did she tell you she came up to my apartment last night dressed in the tightest black dress I ’ve ever seen ? Red lipstick — ”
21785	21792	21793	21793	Rachel	125	“ Tag ! He ’s kidding , ”
21811	21823	21824	21824	He	752	“ — high - heeled boots . Short , short dress . ”
21846	21855	21856	21856	She	88	“ He ’s why you borrowed my dress ! ”
21861	21869	21856	21856	She	88	“ Do I need to launder it ? ”
21873	21886	21887	21887	Rachel	125	“ I did it because he accused me of being a hooker ! ”
22036	22052	22053	22053	He	80	“ It ’s just a walk . We ’re not trading services of any kind . ”
22103	22107	22110	22110	she	88	“ Good luck , ”
22124	22156	22110	22110	she	88	” Rachel said through chattering teeth . The bar was probably fifteen blocks from the apartment . What was she thinking agreeing to walk ? She could n’t feel her nose . “
22160	22190	22110	22110	she	88	” Tag said . She was currently taking two steps for every one of his , given his gait was longer than hers , even at a leisurely pace . “
22204	22223	22224	22224	I	0	” She buried her chin in her scarf as she watched her boots cut through the gathering snow . “
22239	22267	22224	22224	I	0	” God . She was hopeless . Walking down the sidewalk next to a gorgeous guy and talking about the weather . But Tag did n’t balk . “
22272	22284	22268	22268	I	0	” he said , as if this was perfectly acceptable conversation . “
22341	22342	22333	22333	I	0	” “
22350	22354	22344	22344	you	0	” she teased . “
22357	22476	22344	22344	you	0	” He turned his head and smiled and she admired straight , white teeth surrounded by a golden brown beard . He ’d pulled his hair down and the light brown waves fell haphazardly over his black coat . Which was so sexy she could n’t think . Especially since there were snowflakes in the strands . Not that she could blame them . Nestled warmly in those locks was n’t a bad place to imagine being . Again , she wondered at her attraction to him . Though he did kind of look like Thor , and while she was n’t a die - hard comic book fan , she could appreciate the actor in the movie . “
22482	22512	22480	22480	you	0	” she asked , mostly to stop her inane train of thought . The more she was around him , the less she understood her basal reaction to him . “
22527	22528	22519	22519	You	0	” “
22537	22646	22533	22533	you	0	” He shrugged and looked ahead , but she did n’t doubt how he ’d done it . He ’d likely honed his carnival skills and was stellar at guessing weight and height . It was n’t hard to imagine him using his intuition to figure out a woman ’s weak points so he could attack where she was most sensitive . He ’d probably had a ton of practice . Was that where her concern was coming from ? That he ’d find her weak spots and use them against her ? That ’s what Shaun had done , she thought with a token amount of bitterness . “
22653	22681	22649	22649	I	0	” A puff of air came from Tag ’s lips , buried in his beard . She ’d never liked facial hair . Until now , apparently . “
22689	22724	22684	22684	you	0	” she shot back , feeling peeved more with herself than him . Lack of sleep , or maybe too much , she was n’t really sure what to blame her reaction on now . “
22757	22780	22752	22752	I	0	” She pushed her hands deeper into her pockets , lamenting not bringing her gloves with her . Her hands were freezing . “
22790	22802	22784	22784	I	0	” he said . She absorbed that for a few seconds . “
22814	22834	22806	22806	you	0	” She air - quoted those words , which brought her bare hands from her pockets . He noticed . “
22849	22850	22851	22851	I	0	” “
22855	22877	22851	22851	I	0	” Tag stopped walking , a deep sigh working its way from his wide chest as he tugged off his gloves . “
22882	23006	22851	22851	I	0	” But he was n’t listening . Once he ’d had his baseball - mitt - sized gloves off , he lifted her smaller , freezing hands to his mouth , cupping them in his palms , and blew on them to warm her fingers . He did this the way he did everything else . Slowly . Intentionally . And looking right at her . He brushed his lips over her knuckles as a drove of chills shot down her spine and legs . She became fascinated by how soft his beard felt against her freezing skin , and then those chills were replaced with heat . Pooling in her belly , between her thighs , and infusing her face with color . “
23009	23064	22851	22851	I	0	” she muttered when he let her go . She stuffed her hands into his gloves — they were warm , and after his personal attention , so was she . They finished their walk to Crane Tower , and once they were in the lobby , she put that together with Crane Hotels . “
23074	23075	23072	23072	you	773	” “
23083	23531	23072	23072	you	773	” His voice was low and raspy and the pit of her stomach did that pinging thing . Or was it a zing ? Whatever it was , it was unnerving . She could n’t shake the idea that she had n’t wanted to walk home , yet he ’d talked her into it . She did n’t want to get played by the player . To get taken advantage of like Shaun took advantage of you . Since she lived on the floor below Tag , she had no choice but to walk to the elevator with him . Just when she worried about being in an enclosed space with him alone and having nothing to say , another couple stepped into the elevator with them . Phew . They pressed the button for the floor three floors below Rachel ’s , so they were going to be in here a while . Which meant she and Tag would have chaperones . Before she could let out a breath of relief that she would n’t have to force conversation , she noticed the girl ’s eyes were kind of glassy and the guy ’s smile was a little wonky . Drunk . The second the elevator doors swished shut , the guy lunged and the girl caught him tongue first . Gawd . Clearly the inebriated couple had no problem with PDA . Rachel wiggled her hands out of the gloves , leaving them in her pockets , and glued her eyes to her iPhone screen . Which helped , but did n’t shut out the suctioning sounds . She gave up , dropped the phone in her coat pocket , and scooted closer to Tag to avoid the flying arms and legs . Tag was leaning against the back of the elevator , one boot on the wall . She risked a glance up at him when the girl made a mewling sound and Tag looked back down at her , one eyebrow arched into a sexy tilt . When his mouth joined , Rachel looked away . Looking at him while a couple in front of them sucked face was … awkward . Because it made her wonder what his beard might feel like against her lips . There were too many rampant hormones in this tiny enclosed space . Too many pheromones per square foot or something . Maybe she ’d been infected like some sort of airborne virus . The elevator stopped and the doors opened , but the two lovers were n’t finished yet . As the doors started to shut , Tag stepped forward and stopped them with a hand . “
23539	23561	23534	23534	buddy	2261	” The other guy slid his lips away from his girlfriend’s — or whoever she was — and blinked , dazed . “
23566	23640	23564	23564	man	2256	” Then they stumbled out , adhering to each other the second they cleared the lift . Tag looked at the floor , a secret smile gracing his face . He shook his head , which made Rachel wonder what he was thinking , but she did n’t dare ask . Namely because he might blurt out that he was thinking of kissing her and then she ’d be powerless to say anything but “
23643	23684	23564	23564	man	2256	” In the end , neither of them spoke as they rode the few floors up to her temporary penthouse . When the doors opened this time , she practically ran from the elevator , but Tag followed behind her . “
23693	23697	23687	23687	I	0	” he asked . “
23710	23726	23702	23702	you	0	” She was suddenly nervous as she pulled her house key from her jeans pocket . “
23743	23768	23729	23730	those two	776	” Her comment was supposed to lighten the tension between them , but as Tag ’s heat blanketed her side , it intensified instead . “
23773	23792	23793	23793	I	0	” he said into her ear , his voice a low rumble that made her close her eyes . “
23808	23827	23804	23804	I	0	” With that , he stepped away and left a yawning gap of cool air between their bodies . “
23836	23856	23834	23834	Dimples	125	” Sure it was . She licked her lips and unlocked the door . Adonis ran directly to Tag . “
23862	23885	23886	23886	He	777	” she grumbled , miffed at having been bypassed . The Dane offered sloppy kisses to Tag , which he expertly dodged . “
23892	23899	23886	23886	He	777	” He scratched Adonis ’s flank . “
23908	23963	23964	23964	Adonis	86	” Oliver with his gentle mannerisms and quiet midrange voice versus Tag ’s calm confidence and low , baritone reverberating off her ribs . Oliver was like an uncle . Tag was like … a bad idea . In the flesh . So why are you disappointed he ’s not trying to kiss you ? “
23968	23992	23964	23964	Adonis	86	” she commanded . The typically well - behaved dog tromped back into the apartment and stood inside the door , tail wagging . “
23996	24003	23994	23994	you	86	” she turned to tell Tag . “
24009	24010	23994	23994	you	86	” “
24014	24098	23964	23964	Adonis	86	” He was already at the elevator and had pushed the Up button . The doors opened instantly . Another wave of disappointment she could n’t explain covered her . She did n’t want him to pursue or kiss her . She did n’t want to be at the receiving end of a man who would use her and toss her aside . Yet the disappointment stayed when she realized there was no chance of lingering in the private entryway with her neighbor . “
24102	24117	23964	23964	Adonis	86	” he said . It was so final , she let out a sigh . “
24121	24164	23964	23964	Adonis	86	” He stepped in , hit a button , and the doors closed on his handsome face . She walked into her borrowed apartment with her furry companion , determined to shake off every last confusing thing Tag had made her feel tonight .
24818	24821	24803	24803	he	80	“ Hi . ”
24835	24843	24827	24827	Tag	80	“ Hey , Dimples . Come in . ”
24844	24849	24827	24827	Tag	80	“ No , I … ”
24960	24968	24969	24969	she	125	“ I tried to return them sooner , ”
25025	25030	25031	25031	His	80	“ Something to drink ? ”
25043	25048	25031	25031	His	80	“ No , thanks . ”
25049	25054	25055	25055	He	80	“ I have wine . ”
25074	25077	25078	25078	she	125	“ No , ”
25087	25091	25078	25078	she	125	“ Rain check . ”
25092	25098	25099	25099	he	80	“ Hold you to it , ”
25162	25168	25169	25169	she	125	“ Is this for work ? ”
25186	25189	25190	25190	His	80	“ Yeah . ”
25196	25221	25190	25190	His	80	“ Redesigning the bars in a bunch of Crane hotels . He dug under another stack and pulled out a blueprint - style drawing . “
25228	25254	25190	25190	His	80	” She took the prints , a bird’s - eye view of the pool bar with seats and blenders , liquors , and beer taps . “
25262	25263	25190	25190	His	80	” “
25267	25268	25190	25190	His	80	” “
25272	25320	25190	25190	His	80	” She slanted him a disbelieving glance . He grinned . Yeah , she thought he was giving her shit . He could n’t be in charge of Guest and Restaurant Services and not know there was an area where servers picked up their customers ’ drinks . “
25323	25327	25190	25190	His	80	” He pointed . “
25332	25348	25190	25190	His	80	” She held the drawing closer to examine the itty - bitty square of space . “
25352	25353	25190	25190	His	80	” “
25359	25387	25190	25190	His	80	” This time he was n’t teasing her ; he sounded interested in her opinion . He crossed those massive arms over his massive chest and waited . “
25390	25435	25190	25190	His	80	” Do n’t think about how good he smells , even sweaty . She did n’t like sweaty guys . She liked suited guys . Clean - cut guys . No facial hair . A respectably short haircut . What was happening to her ? “
25451	25556	25558	25558	they	808	” she said , grateful she ’d found her former thread of thought . If Tag had an inkling of how he affected her clothed — let alone shirtless — he’d never leave her alone . Which suddenly did n’t sound so bad . Which was why she needed to keep talking . Outside the door , she ’d determined why he was a bad idea and why she was n’t ready for someone of his caliber in her life . In here , she was having a harder time reminding herself why she could n’t roll onto her toes and sample his mouth . “
25561	25575	25558	25558	they	808	” He took the papers , scooting closer to point out the map . “
25588	25589	25558	25558	they	808	” “
25613	25621	25558	25558	they	808	” She shook her head and repeated , “
25625	25647	25558	25558	they	808	” He took the plans , studied them for a long , silent minute , then handed them back to her . “
25652	25660	25558	25558	they	808	” She let out a small laugh . “
25666	25694	25558	25558	they	808	” But his brow was creased , his expression concerned . She took another look and then pointed out the flaws that jumped out at her immediately . “
25715	25718	25707	25715	a bartender who does n’t have particularly long arms”—she	2557	arms”—she gestured to herself—“you
25731	25746	25747	25747	You	809	” She laid the plans on the table next to a spread of photos . “
25775	25814	25707	25715	a bartender who does n’t have particularly long arms”—she	2557	” When he was silent for a few seconds , she lifted her chin to take him in . His eyes were shadowed by the bill of his cap , his mouth pulled flat . He nodded subtly . “
25817	25821	25707	25715	a bartender who does n’t have particularly long arms”—she	2557	” he murmured . “
25828	25829	25822	25822	I	0	” “
25836	25932	25831	25831	you	0	” Those electric eyes arrowed to her soul . She could sense his brain churning . Tag cared about this stuff . In a flash she saw past the player who had talked her into a beer followed by a walk home . He cared enough to bring his work home and spread it out on the table . Cared about his job as much as he cared about his body . And he must . To work it out to such perfection . Her eyes slipped from his face to acres of tempting flesh . “
25944	25949	25934	25934	you	0	” His eyes narrowed . “
25981	25988	25989	25989	I	0	” He offered a cocky smile . “
25997	26032	25989	25989	I	0	” He spread his fingers over his glistening abs . She imagined running a finger over those bumps . One , two , three … Good Lord , he had an eight - pack . “
26048	26115	26042	26042	you	0	” She moved her eyes to his and instantly regretted it . Their gazes locked and when he stepped forward , she was again in the position of stepping away or standing her ground . She should step away . Excuse herself . Her brain tried to call up details of the lecture she ’d given herself at the door , but she came up blank . “
26123	26154	26118	26118	you	0	” she asked , her tone light so he did n’t think she was panicky . He stopped advancing and leaned with one hand on the back of a chair . “
26166	26167	26163	26163	you	0	” “
26170	26191	26192	26192	You	0	” She could n’t help it . The audacity of this guy was incomparable . Who talked like he did ? “
26208	26209	26210	26210	Dimples	125	” “
26223	26268	26219	26219	I	0	” The quip should have earned him a slap , or at least a heel - pivot and a march straight for the door . She should be hoisting her middle finger in the air and leaving . But instead she laughed . Again . “
26274	26282	26283	26283	I	0	” he said around an impermeable grin . “
26290	26291	26283	26283	I	0	” “
26296	26319	26283	26283	I	0	” She crossed her arms protectively . She ’d die before she admitted it , but the thought had crossed her mind . “
26337	26391	26322	26322	I	0	” Arguing with him was her only defense at this point . He emitted testosterone like a mind - altering drug . He did n’t look the least bit insulted as he prowled — yes , prowled — to her . She cleared her throat . Backed up one step , then another . “
26409	26477	26406	26406	you	0	” Another step back and her ass collided with the back of the sofa . She reached behind her to grasp the edge . Tag stood no farther than a foot away , his expression animal , his body making her forget her own name . All that bared skin … He kept coming , dipping his head to take some of the inches off his height . “
26483	26487	26478	26478	You	0	” he stated . “
26491	26498	26478	26478	You	0	” she choked out . Barely . “
26502	26510	26478	26478	You	0	” he said . A simple request . “
26513	26554	26555	26555	I	0	” Her heart hammered against her ribs , reminding her how she was n’t ready for this moment . Maybe in the future with some harmless , neutral guy who made her feel attraction instead of chest - exploding anxiety . “
26592	26593	26577	26577	You	0	” “
26600	26710	26594	26594	I	0	” Her confession was a whisper . She had n’t meant to say that out loud . It was too honest . Too revealing . Was n’t she supposed to be protecting herself after she ’d been thoroughly let down ? She had n’t meant to stand frozen while he made demands . Inappropriate demands . Then she remembered Bree ’s advice from yesterday . Why not let yourself have some fun , Rach ? He looks fun . Her eyes danced over his rounded shoulders and pecs , rock - hard abs and narrow hips . He did look fun . He looked like a damn carnival ride . “
26717	26734	26711	26711	You	0	” he accused , and this time she did n’t argue , because she was busted . “
26738	26748	26736	26736	me	0	” She should say no but heard herself whisper , “
26751	26758	26760	26760	you	0	” He shrugged one round shoulder . “
26763	27022	26711	26711	You	0	” She licked her lips , swallowing thickly and watching as if an observing outsider as her fingers breached the gap between their bodies . Then she did what she ’d imagined a few seconds ago and touched his ab muscles with the tips of her first three fingers where his smooth , slick flesh was stretched over hard muscle . Slowly , she brushed along the second bump , then the third . Ran her index finger around his belly button and the wiry hair surrounding it , then dragged her blunt nails the opposite direction up his right side . When she ’d reached the end of her exploration , she hesitantly lifted her face to his chest and saw it expand with one huge breath . Despite the fact she was terrified to look , she met his eyes next and was nearly floored by the responding heat she found there . Snow fell rapidly outside Tag ’s windows , but between them it was Florida in July . An active volcano . The buzz in the air between them shook her bones . Jetting from her spine to her breasts and lingering in the space between her legs . She wondered about the space between Tag ’s legs , and with a great amount of effort avoided checking the front of his sweatpants for signs she was n’t alone in her attraction . But she was n’t alone . She could see it in his expression . Sense it in his barely controlled posture . “
27027	27045	27024	27024	your	815	” he asked , his voice a thick , lust - filled growl . Not even close . “
27059	27110	27111	27111	Dimples	125	” She slipped away , half surprised Tag did n’t grab her arm , pull her back , and kiss her . Or maybe press her against the door and kiss her . Or throw her on the couch and kiss her . Wow . She ’d take all three . “
27113	27123	27111	27111	Dimples	125	” he called as she jerked the door open . “
27126	27146	27111	27111	Dimples	125	” she asked without turning , her eyes on the patterned carpet leading to the elevator . To freedom . “
27155	27277	27147	27147	I	0	” She did n’t answer . She did n’t turn . She simply nodded , then shut the door behind her , slamming a palm into the elevator button and praying to God Tag did n’t come out to wait with her . At this point , she did n’t trust herself not to lunge at him and have some of the fun she ’d been imagining . When the elevator took its time , she opted for the stairwell . She jogged down to the next floor , working off some of the unfulfilled desire hammering her bloodstream and arriving at her safe haven to a Great Dane with pale gray eyes . That was a close one . Too close .
27459	27462	27463	27463	She	125	“ Dimples . ”
27559	27562	27563	27563	She	125	“ Hi . ”
27592	27600	27587	27587	she	125	“ What are you doing down here ? ”
27613	27625	27606	27606	she	125	“ Oh , no . Not Adonis . Is he … ? ”
27626	27631	27632	27632	Tag	80	“ He ’s fine . ”
27640	27658	27632	27632	Tag	80	“ I needed a change of scenery . I ’m not really an office kind of guy . ”
27659	27667	27674	27674	him	80	“ Do you have an actual office ? ”
27679	27684	27685	27685	He	80	“ A big one . ”
27694	27705	27685	27685	He	80	“ Join me . I ’ll buy you a drink . ”
27706	27710	27711	27711	She	125	“ I should … ”
27715	27719	27711	27711	She	125	“ The dog . ”
27720	27724	27725	27725	He	80	“ Fair enough . ”
27960	27966	27967	27967	Bree	88	“ So you like him , ”
27970	27976	27967	27967	Bree	88	“ I do n’t know . ”
28163	28166	28167	28167	Bree	88	“ Rach , ”
28170	28179	28180	28180	Rachel	125	“ Thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen . ”
28203	28214	28215	28215	Bree	88	“ There you go . Pleasure doing business with you . ”
28228	28231	28215	28215	Bree	88	“ What ? ”
28232	28237	28238	28238	Bree	88	“ You have company . ”
28281	28290	28269	28269	She	125	“ What is it ? What ’s wrong ? ”
28291	28319	28320	28320	His	80	“ Adonis has been barking for going on an hour . Thought I ’d borrow your key and take him out . You close tonight , right ? ”
28326	28336	28320	28320	His	80	“ I ’m assuming since you split your tips . ”
28352	28361	28362	28362	Rachel	125	“ Yeah , I ’m here until close , ”
28365	28368	28369	28369	He	80	“ Key . ”
28375	28384	28369	28369	He	80	“ Tag , you do n’t have to — ”
28385	28414	28419	28424	a guy at the far end	844	“ Adonis is one unhappy pup , Dimples . I ’ll take him out , walk him around . The exercise will be good for both of us . ”
28415	28418	28419	28424	a guy at the far end	844	“ Miss ? ”
28429	28434	28435	28435	she	125	“ Be right there , ”
28475	28479	28449	28449	she	125	“ Thank you . ”
28480	28484	28489	28489	he	80	“ No worries . ”
28547	28560	28561	28561	Rachel	125	“ I thought you two had plans . Were you hanging out ? ”
28564	28570	28561	28561	Rachel	125	“ Need something to drink ? ”
28571	28579	28580	28580	Dean	90	“ Do you know who that was ? ”
28611	28614	28608	28608	She	125	“ No . ”
28615	28619	28620	28620	Dean	90	“ Not him , ”
28623	28632	28620	28620	Dean	90	“ The guy you handed your key to . ”
28633	28639	28640	28640	Bree	88	“ I had no idea , ”
28651	28654	28640	28640	Bree	88	“ Tag ? ”
28662	28668	28655	28655	Rachel	125	“ He ’s my neighbor . ”
28669	28673	28674	28674	Dean	90	“ Tag Crane , ”
28677	28680	28674	28674	Dean	90	“ Okay … ”
28701	28704	28681	28681	Rachel	125	“ What ? ”
28705	28711	28712	28712	Bree	88	“ As in Crane Hotels , ”
28715	28734	28712	28712	Bree	88	“ As in the billionaire Cranes . Reese Crane . Tag Crane . Alexander ‘ Big ’ Crane . ”
28742	28764	28735	28735	Dean	90	“ We designed their billboards last year . We ’re up for bid on another advertising project for them this year . ”
28765	28771	28772	28772	Rachel	125	“ I know Crane Hotels . ”
28788	28796	28778	28778	Tag	80	“ I ’ve heard of Reese Crane … ”
28827	28834	28835	28835	Dean	90	“ Tag is Reese ’s brother , ”
28838	28849	28835	28835	Dean	90	“ Tag runs the restaurant side of Crane Hotels nationwide . ”
28850	28856	28862	28862	he	80	“ Guest and Restaurant Services , ”
28879	28896	28876	28876	Dean	90	“ He owns Crane Tower , too . Where Bree told me you ’re temporarily living . ”
28897	28902	28835	28835	Dean	90	“ He owns it ? ”
28910	28914	28876	28876	Dean	90	“ Excuse me , ”
28922	28932	28876	28876	Dean	90	“ He owns the building I ’m staying in . ”
28950	28970	28933	28933	Her	125	“ My long - haired , bearded neighbor , who closely resembles Tarzan , is a billionaire hotel magnate ? ”
28971	28974	28975	28975	Dean	90	“ Yep , ”
28982	28988	28989	28990	the customer	850	“ Excuse me , miss ? ”
28994	29005	28989	28990	the customer	850	“ Yes , I ’m sorry , be right there . ”
29021	29030	29014	29014	her	125	“ I ca n’t process this right now . ”
29039	29047	29014	29014	her	125	“ Let me help you back there . ”
29048	29055	29056	29056	Rachel	125	“ No , I ’m good . ”
29061	29069	29056	29056	Rachel	125	“ Just … the news surprised me . ”
29350	29353	29339	29339	his	86	“ Woof ! ”
29404	29417	29418	29418	she	125	“ I was worried you ’d left the door unlocked on accident , ”
29422	29425	29418	29418	she	125	“ No . ”
29503	29509	29510	29510	she	125	“ You ’re a Crane , ”
29558	29566	29567	29567	He	80	“ Yeah . I ’m a Crane . ”
29576	29580	29609	29609	He	80	“ Adonis went out about”—he
29590	29608	29609	29609	He	80	kitchen—“thirty minutes ago . So that ’ll save you having to take him out in this mess . ”
29615	29622	29609	29609	He	80	“ Hope you took a car . ”
29623	29627	29609	29609	He	80	“ I did . ”
29628	29631	29664	29664	He	80	“ Good . ”
29632	29642	29609	29609	He	80	“ We ’re not going to talk about it ? ”
29700	29709	29710	29710	she	125	“ Never mind , I ’m too tired , ”
29850	29858	29859	29859	Tag	80	“ What do you want to know ? ”
29910	29919	29920	29920	She	125	“ Now ’s not the time , really . ”
29930	29936	29920	29920	She	125	“ You brought it up . ”
29974	29983	29967	29967	Her	125	“ I did . I was … surprised . ”
29984	29991	29992	29992	he	80	“ How ’d you find out ? ”
29995	30002	29992	29992	he	80	“ Bree ’s fiancé recognized you . ”
30011	30014	30003	30003	Tag	80	“ Ah . ”
30015	30021	30058	30058	He	80	“ Is it a secret ? ”
30022	30057	30058	30058	He	80	“ Not a secret , Dimples . Just like you do n’t want to tell me personal things about you , there are some things I do n’t share if I can help it . ”
30100	30104	30093	30093	She	125	“ Makes sense . ”
30139	30147	30125	30125	she	125	“ Does that change things between us ? ”
30161	30166	30167	30167	she	125	“ Why would it ? ”
30170	30182	30167	30167	she	125	“ Because you do n’t want to deal with a megalomaniac ? ”
30183	30189	30190	30190	she	125	“ Are you a megalomaniac ? ”
30246	30255	30241	30241	he	80	“ No , Dimples . I ’m not . ”
30317	30328	30329	30329	Rachel	125	“ Sorry . I’m … I probably smell like beer . ”
30344	30350	30351	30351	She	125	“ I ’m going to … ”
30384	30393	30394	30394	she	125	“ Thank you for taking care of Adonis , ”
30414	30424	30403	30403	She	125	“ You can leave the key on the table ! ”
30547	30552	30553	30553	she	125	“ Ready for bed ? ”
30720	30727	30728	30728	she	125	“ You did the right thing , ”
30761	30781	30759	30759	Tag	80	” Reese slid into view when he leaned on the conference table and pressed his palms into the glass . “
30788	30818	30759	30759	Tag	80	” Tag blinked at his brother , then his brother ’s fiancée , Merina , who was sitting next to Reese , hand wrapped around a mug of coffee . “
30825	31048	31072	31072	he	876	” He slept fine on Oliver ’s couch , until Rachel returned home . He ’d tried to kiss her , but then she ’d leapt away from him like he was emitting deadly fumes . Afterward , he rode the elevator up , turning the moment over and over in his head . Then in his penthouse , he ’d turned over another moment in his memory — the one where she touched him . The moment her delicate fingers had stroked his bare skin . The way her pink lips parted and her eyes widened with lust - filled curiosity … He ’d been so sure she liked him . Now he was n’t so sure . What was up with her ? Maybe there was something wrong with him . He ’d never been off - kilter when it came to women . Hell , women occupied his mind only up to a certain extent . He was n’t one to fantasize and space out and lose sleep over a woman . But Rachel … He could n’t shake her . He could n’t quit thinking about her . What her touch did to him . No other touch had ever been as welcome as her tentative fingers brushing his abdomen . Damned if he could figure out why . “
31061	31069	31072	31072	he	876	” His oldest brother was frowning now . “
31076	31087	31072	31072	he	876	” Merina touched Reese ’s hand and rolled her eyes . “
31097	31113	31096	31096	You	875	look”—she assessed him , and he squirmed in his chair , worried she could read his thoughts—“consumed
31115	31134	31096	31096	You	875	” He was consumed . With the woman he even now could n’t shove out of his psyche . “
31151	31152	31153	31153	I	0	” “
31158	31180	31153	31153	I	0	” he grumbled . He ground his back molars together . Did Merina assume the project was too much for him ? “
31189	31215	31181	31181	I	0	” Her eyebrows tilted . Then her eyes narrowed and he could practically feel her reaching for the real reason for his lacking attention span . “
31218	31235	31181	31181	I	0	” he blurted , taking the out Merina had offered and running for the goal line . “
31244	31245	31246	31246	I	0	” “
31262	31269	31246	31246	I	0	” She sipped from her mug . “
31288	31292	31293	31293	He	875	” Like Rachel ? “
31302	31319	31293	31293	He	875	” Reese said , formal tone set to lock , but his eyes glimmered with challenge . “
31327	31337	31338	31338	You	875	” Reese straightened and fiddled with a cuff link . “
31352	31383	31384	31385	The board	2250	” He was doing that on purpose . He knew damn well Tag would n’t take a break while his department lost money no matter how the board rated it . “
31408	31409	31384	31385	The board	2250	” “
31414	31421	31412	31412	boys	2423	” Merina said with a chuckle . “
31438	31475	31433	31433	I	0	” She gestured at Reese ’s pants . The quip earned a hearty laugh from Reese , who put his arm around his soon - to - be wife and kissed her square on the lips . “
31485	31568	31483	31483	you	0	” Again , Tag was hit with the strangest desire to have what his brother had . A woman at his side , good - naturedly jabbing him . A woman who made an effort to be involved and informed about his work . The desire was disconcerting and threw him so far off , he might not find on again . What Tag needed was to get laid . Preferably by the cute blonde with the dimples currently mangling his brains . “
31577	31589	31569	31569	I	0	” Reese , not taking his eyes from Merina , said , “
31602	31677	31678	31678	Rach	128	” Tag did as asked , leaving the Crane with no real destination in mind . First , he stopped in to Andromeda , said hi to Bree , and ordered a beer . After pretending he was n’t looking for her blond cohort , he casually slipped into the conversation the question of whether Rachel was working today . Bree had narrowed her eyes and offered a knowing smirk when she ’d said , “
31684	31730	31678	31678	Rach	128	” At the lobby of Crane Tower , he considered another beer , figuring he could loiter until she walked by with Adonis . Which sounded pathetic . Sternly , he reminded his balls he was n’t a fifteen - year - old any longer . “
31736	32030	31734	31734	man	2256	” he scolded himself , standing halfway between the bar and the hallway leading to the elevators . Indecision was n’t typically his MO . She ’d turned him inside out , and he had no idea why . Although it could be argued he ’d never had a woman behave almost scared of him the way Rachel was . He did n’t get the impression she feared him or his actions , though . More like she did n’t trust herself with him . Which intrigued him . What was she afraid might happen ? He had a big personality . No problem pushing . But in her case , he had n’t wanted to push her away . Which was a new approach for him . He ’d never had to be careful . Either a woman wanted him or she did n’t . And if she did n’t , there were always more . Hell , there were plenty more . He ’d clocked a leggy , black - haired , mocha - skinned beauty at the bar watching him the second he ’d set foot inside the lobby . But he did n’t want the leggy woman currently staring at him over her wineglass . He wanted a cute , dimpled blonde . Worse , the situation with Rachel had created a niggling in the back of his skull that felt a lot like doubt . His gut was n’t telling him anything , and his people instincts were failing him miserably . There was only one of two foreseeable paths to take in this case . Either seal the deal with his neighbor or forget about her . Those two choices left him with no choice at all . “
32033	32316	31734	31734	man	2256	” He used the word to propel him to the elevators and to Rachel ’s apartment . He was n’t going to give up or back away from what he wanted . And what he wanted was Rachel . He had come up with a plan earlier today to involve her in his bar - rehab project . She ’d had a lot of opinions the evening she ’d stopped by his place unannounced , and he was a man in need of another opinion . Hers , preferably . She was n’t in Crane Tower forever . Her job as Adonis ’s caregiver would end , and then she ’d be gone . Tag was n’t letting her go without at least getting her phone number . He knocked , rolling his shoulders and licking his lips in preparation to see her . The front door opened to her wearing tight black stretchy pants and a long pink sweater . Her blond hair flowed over her shoulders , and her blue eyes went wide and innocent . Every inch of him wanted to sweep her into his arms and kiss her senseless . So he did . He looped an arm around her waist and pulled her against his body . Small hands met his shoulders , and he lowered his lips to hers to taste that pout . It was the briefest touch of their lips but tightened every muscle in his body . She was warm . She was soft . She tasted better than he could ’ve imagined . He lowered her to her heels , pulled his lips away , and slid his hands from her back . “
32327	32371	31734	31734	man	2256	” he said , looking down at her . Her fingers had gone to her lips , but she remained speechless . Which made him uncharacteristically nervous since he could n’t tell if she ’d liked it . Surely she ’d liked it . “
32374	32387	31734	31734	man	2256	” She let out a little breath that sounded like a laugh . “
32396	32453	32389	32389	you	885	” Okay . Definitely , he was off script here . By now , they should be ravishing each other , hands and limbs everywhere . He was n’t a total pig , he did n’t expect to get laid after kiss number one , but he expected her reaction to be at least … favorable ? “
32458	32486	32487	32487	I	0	” He took an awkward step forward as she stepped back . He ’d come to get answers , but so far was only left with questions . “
32493	32504	32487	32487	I	0	” The offer of a drink was a good sign . “
32507	32508	32487	32487	I	0	” “
32517	32526	32509	32509	I	0	” she said from behind the refrigerator door . “
32531	32548	32549	32549	I	0	” Another good sign . He relaxed some , leaning a hip on the kitchen counter . “
32580	32693	32694	32694	I	0	” Right . The bar plans . That kiss had erased his short - term memory . He accepted the beer bottle with a tight smile . Refocus , he told his other head , the one currently stuck on Seduce the Girl . Evidently , Rachel did n’t want to be seduced . Not tonight anyway . Her blasé reaction had seriously messed with his head . The one on his shoulders . She came to him next , unfolding the papers and flattening them on the counter . A soft scent wafted from her hair and mingled with his senses . Her arm brushed his and his legs went rigid . “
32703	32751	32694	32694	I	0	” She looked up at him with a sheepish and completely adorable smile . Damn . He wanted to kiss her again . His gaze went to her lips , but she averted her eyes quickly . He ’d pick his timing more carefully the next time . “
32760	32786	32752	32752	You	0	” he asked , his eyes landing on her neat , curly penmanship . Winshop Luxury Hotels was one of Crane Hotels ’ major competitors . “
32796	32802	32790	32790	I	0	” She waved a hand . “
32850	32853	32854	32854	You	891	” Impressive . “
32870	32871	32863	32863	I	0	” “
32874	32879	32863	32863	I	0	” Her brow dented . “
32889	32890	32885	32885	you	891	” “
32906	32932	32900	32900	I	0	” Her eyes slipped to one side and he realized bringing up his days of picking up girls in bars was not to his favor . “
32937	32953	32900	32900	I	0	” he said , choppily steering the conversation back to where he ’d untethered it . “
32985	33008	32976	32976	I	0	” She winked conspiratorially , pale lashes closing over one blue eye , and he shook his head to reset his brain . “
33016	33188	33013	33013	you	894	” he said , his voice low , his mind back on scooping her up again and seeing how many tricks he could teach her with his tongue . The attraction was n’t solely physical , but the desire to take care of her , to make her feel incredible , encompassed every moment he was with her . The urge had surpassed him getting laid or having a night of fun . He wanted to crack her open , know why she liked the things she liked . Which definitely put him in where the hell am I ? territory . He wiped his brow , unsurprised to find a few beads of sweat there . She frowned , so he refocused on the papers . He could n’t remember a time he ’d struck out this badly . And Rachel was n’t a chick in a bar . She was in her house , or , well , her temporary house . He should have more game than this . “
33197	33198	33193	33193	Rachel	125	” “
33220	33246	33202	33202	I	0	” She offered him a bottle opener and he realized he had n’t thought to take a drink of the beer she ’d given him . “
33253	33302	33202	33202	I	0	” Meeting her curious gaze , he considered his plans were whatever she was willing to do with him . A distant warning siren blared in his head . He was n’t calling the shots when it came to her . Was that why he was so thrown ? “
33313	33322	33303	33303	I	0	” she said when he did n’t respond . “
33335	33336	33337	33337	You	125	” “
33343	33388	33337	33337	You	125	” He smiled , tipping his head toward the door . His turf . His place . Maybe that ’s what he needed to get on even ground . He waited for the flush to steal her cheeks . Instead , her eyes shuttered . “
33401	33415	33399	33399	Adonis	86	” The dog lifted his head from the couch where he was lazing . “
33422	33427	33416	33416	He	86	” Tag could relate . “
33435	33485	33416	33416	He	86	” He left the beer bottle on the counter , turned , and walked out the door . He ’d either lost his touch or had seriously miscalculated the attraction between him and his neighbor . Unless it was one - sided . Which was alarming in every way possible .
33499	33504	33489	33489	Bree	88	“ Then what happened ? ”
33553	33581	33582	33582	Rachel	125	“ Then he came back downstairs and for the next two hours , we discussed how he could improve the bars at Crane Hotels across the US . ”
33598	33603	33604	33604	she	125	“ He kissed you , ”
33616	33630	33604	33604	she	125	“ Did n’t he kiss you again ? Like , when he left ? ”
33631	33637	33638	33638	Rachel	125	“ No , but I … ”
33669	33683	33684	33684	she	125	“ I wanted him to , but I did n’t act like it , ”
33730	33739	33740	33740	Rachel	125	“ I ’m going to his apartment tomorrow , ”
33750	33754	33740	33740	Rachel	125	“ A date ? ”
33759	33766	33755	33755	Bree	88	“ We did n’t define it . ”
33902	33913	33914	33914	Rachel	125	“ Totally understandable . Shaun did a number on you . ”
33959	33967	33968	33968	Bree	88	“ From everything you ’ve told me , ”
33971	34000	33968	33968	Bree	88	“ he was overly critical . Making you think your idea at work was subpar and then taking credit for it behind your back . What a dick . ”
34049	34054	34045	34045	he	903	“ love you , Rach ”
34202	34207	34208	34208	Rachel	125	“ Oh , God . ”
34234	34241	34226	34226	she	125	“ I ’m afraid of sex . ”
34242	34251	34252	34252	Bree	88	“ No . No , no , no . ”
34274	34291	34262	34262	her	88	“ No , you ’re not . You ’re nervous about getting back on the horse . ”
34301	34308	34262	34262	her	88	“ Tag Crane is a Clydesdale . ”
34309	34315	34316	34316	Rachel	125	“ He ’s too much , ”
34323	34352	34316	34316	Rachel	125	“ That ’s why I did n’t kiss him back . Why I keep pushing back . I ca n’t handle a Clydesdale right now . If ever . ”
34353	34387	34389	34389	her	125	“ He ’s not too much . He ’s just right . You deserve to overindulge after being under Shaun ’s thumb . You ca n’t indulge much more than a Viking billionaire . ”
34395	34400	34392	34392	Rachel	125	“ Seriously , Bree . ”
34401	34406	34407	34407	Bree	88	“ Yeah , seriously . ”
34412	34442	34443	34443	Bree	88	“ He can handle you if you walk away afterward , which is what you need . Nothing tying you down . Nothing putting you back in Shaun Territory . ”
34513	34519	34520	34520	Bree	88	“ And look at Tag , ”
34533	34550	34520	34520	Bree	88	“ You know he ’s good in bed . The kiss … tell me about it . ”
34555	34563	34520	34520	Bree	88	“ Tell me what it was like . ”
34564	34570	34520	34520	Bree	88	“ I already told you . ”
34571	34606	34607	34607	Bree	88	“ No you did n’t . You said you did n’t kiss him back ; you wanted him to kiss you again , but you did n’t tell me what the kiss was like . ”
34612	34632	34607	34607	Bree	88	“ This is the part where you prove you ’re not afraid of sex . Describe it to me . ”
34633	34637	34638	34638	Rachel	125	“ It was … ”
34682	34686	34687	34687	she	125	“ Really nice , ”
34696	34701	34702	34702	Bree	88	“ Uh - huh . ”
34705	34716	34702	34702	Bree	88	“ You ’re not a dirty talker , are you ? ”
34717	34720	34721	34721	Shaun	83	“ No . ”
34757	34764	34751	34751	he	911	“ Do I need to be ? ”
34765	34829	34830	34830	Rachel	125	“ You do n’t have to do anything you do n’t want to , Rach .

49897	49919	49920	49920	She	125	“ Yeah … but I ’m saving for a deposit on an apartment so I can get out of your hair . ”
49942	49961	49928	49928	Bree	88	“ Rach . I know it ’ll take time . You ’re not going to be here forever . ”

50064	50076	50077	50077	Rachel	125	“ We ’re not going any further than where it is , ”
50294	50303	50304	50304	Rachel	125	“ And do n’t think about the future . ”

50716	50731	50732	50732	Rachel	125	“ Rachel is joining me in Hawaii as an advisor on my latest project . ”
50783	50845	50775	50775	Oliver	85	“ Congratulations , Rachel . Crane Hotels is a fine company . Does this mean you ’re out of the bar ? Do n’t misunderstand me , I prefer you to wait on me and I ’ll miss you , but this is the professional job you wanted , right ? A second chance outside of the corporate shadow of your — ”
50846	50849	50850	50850	she	125	“ No ! ”
50881	50909	50860	50860	She	125	“ I mean , yes , this is a great opportunity , but I have n’t left the Andromeda . Working with Tag is a temporary gig . ”
50938	50965	50924	50924	Tag	80	“ No one is more qualified to give me an unbiased opinion . I ’m lucky she jumped on it , even though it ’s temporary . ”
50993	50997	50998	50998	Oliver	85	“ Have fun , ”
51009	51030	50998	50998	Oliver	85	“ You are going to love the island . Make sure to take a surfing lesson while you ’re there . ”

51123	51153	51116	51116	Oliver	85	“ Frankly , I thought you already had keys to the residences . Keep it . Adonis was in good hands while I was gone . Thank you both . ”
51183	51192	51178	51178	she	125	“ How ’d you know I was here ? ”

51267	51283	51284	51284	He	80	“ On Oahu , time will go slower . We ’ll make sure of it . ”
51314	51339	51340	51340	he	80	“ We fly out at midnight . I figured the later the flight the more likely you are to sleep through the whole thing , ”
51358	51363	51350	51350	He	80	“ It ’s unlocked . ”
51381	51395	51396	51396	he	80	“ Do you want to take a nap before we go ? Shower ? ”
51405	51416	51399	51399	his	80	“ Um . No , thanks . I ’m good . ”
51449	51465	51437	51437	He	80	“ I ’m going to stash your stuff in here . Make yourself at home . ”
51529	51532	51512	51512	she	125	“ Tag ? ”
51533	51536	51537	51537	He	80	“ Yeah ? ”
51594	51598	51599	51599	he	80	“ You okay ? ”
51602	51609	51599	51599	he	80	“ You look … not okay . ”

51641	51655	51617	51617	he	80	“ Overwhelmed , I guess . I ’ve never … flown that far . ”
51682	51714	51617	51617	he	80	“ Good news . We ’re taking the company jet , so you wo n’t have to worry about layovers or security or any inconvenience . Straight shot to Honolulu airport . ”
51715	51721	51722	51722	She	125	“ Company jet . Right . ”
51732	51737	51722	51722	She	125	“ And the rooms ? ”
51738	51759	51760	51760	She	125	“ We ’ll stay at Crane Makai , our hotel on Oahu . The suites there are top - notch . ”
51772	51775	51760	51760	She	125	“ Together ? ”
51776	51831	51832	51832	She	125	“ I booked one for each of us . And no , you ’re not paying for it ; I do n’t care how much you bitch at me about it . This is what I do , Dimples . I am entitled to provide a room for you and not take your money . ”
51918	51930	51911	51911	She	125	“ I think we could share one , do n’t you ? ”
51941	51944	51931	51931	He	1092	“ Unless … ”
51949	51965	51945	51945	Her	125	“ I mean if you do n’t want to , that ’s fine , too . ”
51979	51982	51972	51972	She	125	“ Dimples . ”
51997	52033	51983	51983	He	1092	“ Hell yeah , I want to share a room with you . I had a great time the other night , and I was hoping on this trip we ’d see what else happened . ”
52049	52075	52076	52076	She	125	“ Honey , I have imagined you in a lot of ways , and most of them involve you naked in my bed in Hawaii . ”
52620	52634	52617	52617	he	80	“ For being nervous about flying , you do n’t act very nervous . ”
52727	52740	52741	52741	he	80	“ Why is it you look like you ’re thinking something sinister ? ”
52749	52765	52741	52741	he	80	“ And do n’t lie to me , Dimples . I have a sixth sense . ”
52794	52799	52800	52800	she	81	“ I ’m surprised … ”
52812	52815	52800	52800	she	81	“ Because ? ”
52816	52839	52840	52840	She	81	“ Because I expected you to induct me into the Mile High Club by now . This is my first private flight . ”
52886	52890	52893	52893	he	80	“ Excuse me . ”
52986	52991	52978	52978	She	81	“ Let ’s go . ”
53014	53017	53018	53018	she	81	“ Wait , ”
53029	53035	53018	53018	she	81	“ What are you doing ? ”
53068	53074	53075	53075	He	80	“ Making you a member . ”
53118	53124	53115	53115	she	81	“ Where did you go ? ”
53125	53135	53115	53115	she	81	“ Told the pilot to take the long way . ”
53136	53145	53161	53161	his	80	“ There ’s a longer way to Hawaii ? ”
53146	53151	53152	53152	He	80	“ There is now . ”
53196	53204	53205	53205	He	80	“ I like this season on you . ”
53211	53218	53219	53219	he	80	“ More skin . Less clothes , ”
53225	53242	53219	53219	he	80	“ Hey ! Do n’t wrinkle it . I wanted to get lei’d in that dress . ”
53246	53254	53219	53219	he	80	“ Oh , now you ’re cute ? ”
53255	53264	53280	53280	his	80	“ I do n’t know . Am I ? ”
53304	53312	53286	53286	His	80	“ Yeah , Dimples . You are . ”
53640	53646	53647	53647	she	81	“ So good at that , ”
53663	53674	53647	53647	she	81	“ You did n’t need as much coaxing this time . ”
53689	53692	53675	53675	He	80	“ Minx . ”
53693	53701	53702	53702	His	80	“ Tell me you have a condom . ”
53707	53721	53722	53722	He	80	“ I want the gold membership , Tag . Do n’t short me . ”
53736	53749	53722	53722	He	80	“ Trust me , Dimples , there ’s nothing short about me . ”
53774	53777	53771	53771	She	81	“ come here ”
53803	53814	53815	53815	he	80	“ You continue surprising me ; did you know that ? ”
53818	53824	53815	53815	he	80	“ I ’m surprising myself . ”
53923	53929	53930	53930	he	80	“ Am I crushing you ? ”
53949	53957	53930	53930	he	80	“ No . I like you here . ”
53968	53976	53981	53981	he	80	“ I like me here , too . ”
54110	54113	54114	54114	Her	81	“ Tag . ”
54119	54122	54123	54123	he	80	“ Close , ”
54129	54136	54123	54123	he	80	“ I want you to come . ”
54159	54163	54153	54153	He	80	“ You first . ”
54164	54169	54170	54170	She	81	“ One ’s enough . ”
54192	54200	54201	54201	He	80	“ Not on my watch , Dimples . ”
54348	54354	54355	54355	he	80	“ Working hard over here , ”
54361	54366	54355	54355	he	80	“ You with me ? ”
54379	54385	54367	54367	She	81	“ I ’m with you . ”
54386	54389	54367	54367	She	81	“ Good . ”
54782	54791	54779	54779	his	80	“ I ’m sorry . I was uh … ”
54803	54807	54792	54792	She	125	“ Objectifying me ? ”
54841	54851	54852	54852	He	80	“ I ’m yours to use up , Rachel . ”
54870	54877	54852	54852	He	80	“ Ready to see the bar ? ”
54901	54908	54909	54909	He	80	“ Oh . Okay . Sure . ”
55035	55040	55051	55051	he	80	“ Wow . Busy . ”
55041	55046	55047	55047	His	80	“ What the hell … ”
55056	55063	55051	55051	he	80	“ It ’s never this disorganized . ”
55236	55243	55244	55244	Rachel	125	“ Hey , Tag . Aloha ! ”
55289	55292	55293	55293	He	1174	“ Greg . ”

55324	55334	55319	55319	Tag	80	“ Greg ’s our on - site maintenance manager . ”
55335	55341	55319	55319	Tag	80	“ Nice to meet you . ”
55342	55346	55347	55347	Greg	164	“ Bar project ? ”
55355	55369	55370	55370	Tag	80	“ Yeah . Speaking of , what ’s going on with this mess ? ”
55376	55384	55385	55385	Greg	164	“ Swim - up bar ’s shut . ”
55439	55447	55448	55448	Tag	80	“ No one cleared that with me . ”
55456	55463	55448	55448	Tag	80	“ What ’s wrong with it ? ”
55464	55472	55448	55448	Tag	80	“ Sinks were acting up or something . ”
55473	55500	55501	55501	Tag	80	“ How about you find out what the ‘ or something ’ is and get back with me on how fast you can have it repaired ? ”
55531	55539	55540	55540	Greg	164	“ How long has it been closed ? ”
55552	55556	55549	55549	he	164	“ Few weeks . ”
55557	55566	55519	55519	him	80	“ I want an answer in an hour . ”
55567	55574	55575	55575	Tag	80	“ You got it , boss . ”
55589	55597	55575	55575	Tag	80	“ Thanks for taking care of this . ”
55617	55622	55612	55612	Greg	164	“ Enjoy the island . ”
55654	55657	55642	55642	she	125	“ What ? ”
55671	55686	55642	55642	she	125	“ You pack a lot of authority for a guy so laid - back . ”
55697	55707	55708	55708	He	164	“ I know how to get what I want . ”
55727	55751	55724	55724	he	164	“ You personally know how authoritative I can be , Dimples . You want to transfer that control , you let me know . ”
55892	55900	55901	55906	the woman he ’d called Karina	1192	“ Want me to bring them out ? ”
55937	55945	55946	55946	he	80	“ No . You ’re too busy , ”
55949	55954	55946	55946	he	80	“ We ’ll wait . ”
55955	55961	55962	55963	another bartender	1194	“ I ’ll get it , ”
56034	56041	56009	56009	He	80	“ People are looking at us . ”
56053	56064	56065	56065	he	80	“ It ’s because you look hot in your dress , ”
56095	56102	56103	56103	he	80	“ You can toss that underneath , ”
56109	56115	56103	56103	he	80	“ It ’s for us . ”
56116	56122	56123	56123	She	166	“ Membership has its privileges . ”
56142	56152	56131	56131	Her	166	“ Do n’t you want to handle that first ? ”
56162	56173	56159	56159	his	80	“ I did . You saw me talk to Greg . ”
56174	56192	56159	56159	his	80	“ You do n’t want to question any other bartenders ? Maybe talk to the hotel staff ? ”
56193	56237	56238	56238	She	1203	“ You have to give people a chance to prove themselves , Dimples . Greg ’s a big boy . If he screwed up , he can fix it . If he does n’t fix it , I ’ll take the next step . ”
56264	56268	56269	56269	She	1203	“ Climb in . ”
56313	56319	56320	56320	She	1203	“ It ’s incredible here . ”
56354	56359	56379	56379	Tag	80	“ This is pretty . ”
56360	56378	56379	56379	Tag	80	“ If I said ‘ so are you , ’ would you think it was a line ? ”
56415	56418	56395	56395	He	80	“ Probably . ”
56419	56435	56436	56436	His	80	“ Well , far be it from me not to live up to your expectations . ”
56476	56484	56485	56485	She	1203	“ Wait . What ’d that mean ? ”
56488	56496	56497	56497	He	80	“ You think this is my game ? ”
56503	56515	56497	56497	He	80	“ Get you here , get you out of your clothes . ”
56528	56546	56516	56516	She	1203	“ What if that ’s my game ? Come here and get you out of your clothes ? ”
56547	56551	56552	56552	He	80	“ Is it ? ”
56580	56586	56576	56576	She	1203	“ I ’m not answering that ”
56623	56629	56630	56630	she	1203	“ These drinks are huge , ”
56660	56666	56667	56667	He	80	“ Cranes do n’t skimp . ”
56682	56710	56667	56667	He	80	“ Maybe you should consider sizing them down . It would help for repeat business , and in this heat , keep everyone with a cold beverage . ”
56730	56738	56721	56721	He	80	“ You do n’t waste any time . ”
56739	56747	56748	56748	She	1203	“ This is why I ’m here . ”
56767	56774	56775	56775	He	80	“ What else did you notice ? ”
56808	56811	56791	56791	he	80	“ Um . ”
56823	56868	56869	56869	She	1203	“ The layout of the bar is n’t conducive to this many guests . Even with the swim - up bar open , patrons will probably choose not to drink or they ’ll sneak in their own liquor rather than wait in the line . ”
56921	56938	56880	56880	she	1203	“ Clearly , you do n’t have a staff problem . They ’re efficient , friendly . ”
56939	56955	56956	56956	He	80	“ They are . Karina ’s been here from the start . Hired her myself . ”
56961	56966	56956	56956	He	80	“ She watches you . ”
56984	56993	56979	56979	Karina	166	“ Did you two … ? Never mind . ”
57045	57055	57056	57056	she	125	“ I ’m going to work a few shifts , ”
57064	57070	57071	57071	he	80	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
57082	57091	57056	57056	she	125	“ Oh , I wo n’t take tips . ”
57092	57095	57056	57056	she	125	“ Rachel … ”
57096	57139	57056	57056	she	125	“ Absolutely not . You ’re letting me stay in your room . I did n’t pay for this drink . The least you can let me do is what I promised to do , which is help you improve the bar . ”
57140	57168	57171	57171	he	1216	“ I did n’t bring you here to put you behind the bar , Dimples . I want you to advise , not work your ass off . ”

65499	65511	65471	65471	He	1306	“ I ’m guessing this is n’t something you normally do . ”
65627	65630	65644	65644	he	1306	“ us . ”
65631	65641	65644	65644	he	1306	“ This is n’t normal for me , Dimples , ”
65682	65686	65687	65687	she	125	“ Me neither , ”
65690	65707	65687	65687	she	125	“ Because you dated a guy in marketing who never treated you like he should ’ve ? ”
65720	65723	65724	65724	she	125	“ Right , ”
65746	65765	65735	65735	She	125	“ He was clean - shaven with short hair and only a few inches taller than I am . ”
65766	65772	65773	65773	Tag	80	“ Sounds like a sissy , ”
65780	65793	65776	65776	Her	125	“ He did n’t appreciate me . I should have left sooner . ”
65809	65815	65816	65816	He	1306	“ You ’re out now . ”
65853	65866	65867	65867	he	1306	“ Still want to work a day shift while you ’re here ? ”
65870	65899	65867	65867	he	1306	“ You know , I would . I think it would give me a better idea of what you need to do to make this place a success . ”
65900	65908	65909	65909	His	1306	“ You care , do n’t you ? ”
65913	65918	65909	65909	His	1306	“ About this place . ”
65919	65928	65932	65932	she	125	“ Is n’t that why you invited me ? ”
65940	65950	65932	65932	she	125	“ I ’m paying for dinner tonight , too . ”
65951	65957	65958	65958	He	1306	“ I ’m capable of — ”
65967	65976	65958	65958	He	1306	“ Shut up and enjoy it , Dimples . ”
66158	66166	66167	66167	She	125	“ Oh , you ’re an angel . ”
66178	66196	66197	66197	He	80	“ You ’re drinking this on the beach . Sun ’s up soon . Let ’s go . ”
66276	66286	66287	66287	she	125	“ Really going to miss this kind of treatment , ”
66297	66306	66287	66287	she	125	“ You ’ll have to come back then . ”
66356	66387	66348	66348	Shaun	83	“ No need to go out for Valentine ’s Day , right , Rach ? We do n’t need to go out to dinner to know we love each other . ”
66455	66467	66444	66444	He	80	“ Sit here , Dimples . We ’re doing this right . ”
66468	66477	66478	66478	She	125	“ You do n’t act like a billionaire . ”
66488	66530	66478	66478	She	125	“ I take it you were n’t impressed with the whisking - you - away - to - Oahu - by - private - plane bit ? Because I have to tell you , that ’s my go - to move . ”
66531	66538	66539	66539	She	125	“ You know what I mean . ”
66544	66554	66541	66541	her	125	“ Having money means getting to do fun things . ”

66735	66756	66726	66726	He	80	“ We can talk strategy for the bars on the flight home . Unless you had something else in mind ? ”
66793	66797	66798	66798	She	125	“ You know … ”
66810	66819	66798	66798	She	125	“ I think we can fit in both . ”
66820	66828	66829	66829	He	80	“ I like the sound of that . ”
66846	66863	66829	66829	He	80	“ Do we have time to stop by a store to pick up a few souvenirs ? ”
66864	66870	66798	66798	She	125	“ Sure . For Bree ? ”
66871	66908	66798	66798	She	125	“ Yes , and my cousin . Her wedding is coming up , and I ’d like to buy her something unique . She ’s getting married at my parents ’ house the month after next . ”
66909	66914	66798	66798	She	125	“ Weddings . Yikes . ”
66930	66936	66937	66937	she	125	“ Not one for matrimony ? ”
66942	66945	66937	66937	she	125	“ No . ”
66953	66966	66946	66946	His	80	“ I avoid any get - together that involves the Chicken Dance . ”
66967	66973	66974	66974	she	125	“ It does get old , ”
67004	67012	67015	67015	he	80	“ I get invited to a lot of weddings”—a
67018	67028	67060	67060	He	80	coffee—“and I make it a point to avoid them . ”
67029	67040	67041	67041	He	80	“ Did n’t you go to your brother ’s wedding ? ”
67046	67059	67060	67060	He	80	“ Well , yeah , but I did n’t take a date . ”
67075	67087	67060	67060	He	80	“ Why not ? Surely Reese could afford a plus one . ”
67103	67118	67096	67096	her	125	“ It was … you know . The girl I was seeing was n’t … ”
67129	67139	67119	67119	He	80	“ Shit , now I sound like a douche . ”
67156	67158	67160	67160	his	80	“ Truth is”—he
67163	67178	67160	67160	his	80	hers—“I do n’t want to give wrong impressions , and weddings give wrong impressions . ”
67198	67202	67203	67203	she	125	“ Makes sense , ”
67207	67216	67203	67203	she	125	“ Good . I was burying myself there . ”
67507	67513	67514	67514	Her	125	“ It ’s freezing here . ”
67530	67535	67536	67536	he	80	“ You ’re zonked , ”
67547	67560	67544	67544	she	125	“ Kevin , forget that first address . Go to my place . ”
67561	67586	67611	67611	She	125	“ Yes , Mr. Crane . Ms. Foster , there is a vent by your legs if you ’d like to adjust the heat . ”
67630	67639	67640	67640	she	125	“ No , I need to go home , ”
67644	67666	67640	67640	she	125	“ If I go to your house this late , I ’ll fall asleep and wo n’t be able to leave . ”
67667	67670	67671	67671	His	80	“ Deal . ”
67703	67720	67721	67721	She	125	“ It ’s no big deal . I have a big bed . You have luggage . ”
67756	67759	67784	67784	his	80	“ Thanks . ”
67760	67763	67764	67764	he	80	“ Welcome , ”
67881	67912	67913	67913	she	125	“ If you push back the bar rather than have it in the center of the two pools , you could create a place for the guests to hang out , ”
67917	67945	67946	67946	She	125	“ Milling around would be easier if they were n’t in danger of slipping into the swimming pools by taking a step to the left or right . ”
67992	68016	68017	68017	She	125	“ Even with the swim - up open again , you ’ll increase your ability for more traffic if the bar is elsewhere . ”
68025	68066	68067	68067	She	125	“ And I was right about the setup . Your server ’s wells are too far apart . You need one designated area , and preferably one bartender who prioritizes the servers and helps the other two bartenders during downtime . ”
68083	68124	68125	68125	She	125	“ Once you have it redesigned , I ’m betting you can use this as a template for some of your other hotels . I know Hawaii is a different setup given there are multiple pools , but I think … ”
68134	68137	68125	68125	She	125	“ What ? ”
68158	68165	68140	68140	his	1336	“ Nothing . I ’m listening . ”
68166	68171	68172	68172	She	125	“ You ’re staring . ”
68184	68191	68172	68172	She	125	“ Sorry , I ’m passionate . ”
68257	68266	68267	68267	He	1336	“ Reese is going to love your ideas . ”
68281	68294	68267	68267	He	1336	“ Why ’d you leave marketing for the glam life of bartending ? ”
68302	68311	68295	68295	Her	125	“ Just … It was time to go . ”
68312	68315	68295	68295	Her	125	“ Why ? ”
68324	68327	68295	68295	Her	125	“ Truth ? ”
68328	68334	68335	68335	He	1336	“ You have to ask ? ”
68353	68359	68360	68360	she	125	“ My ex - boyfriend , ”
68370	68373	68360	68360	she	125	“ Damn . ”
68382	68390	68374	68374	He	1336	“ I knew it was his fault . ”
68391	68425	68426	68426	Tag	80	“ We were partners on a project , and he took full credit for what amounted to seventy - five percent my ideas . Management gave him the promotion I was angling for . ”
68429	68465	68426	68426	Tag	80	“ I know , right ? Dick move to pull on your girlfriend . We had a big fight at work . My boss suggested I resign before I was written up and possibly fired . ”
68471	68485	68467	68467	Tag	80	“ Your boss sounds like as big of a dick as your ex . ”
68486	68493	68494	68494	Her	1338	“ Ca n’t argue with that . ”
68498	68507	68494	68494	Her	1338	“ So what do you want to do ? ”
68573	68582	68583	68583	he	80	“ Do you see yourself in marketing again ? ”
68594	68602	68583	68583	he	80	“ Not really . I like bartending . ”
68612	68626	68609	68609	her	1338	“ I liked sharing this project with you . It ’s been fun . ”
68643	68674	68675	68675	She	1338	“ But joining another corporate circus ? I do n’t know . Employees can be vindictive . Each out to stomp on other people in their race to the top . ”
68682	68730	68675	68675	She	1338	“ Bartending is one for all , all for one . You band together and do the job . Survive the rush . Make tips . Split the bar so you make sure each bartender is waiting on the person they ’ll extract the most money from . ”
68731	68734	68735	68735	Tag	80	“ Smart , ”
68741	68751	68735	68735	Tag	80	“ Who knew you were such a good player ? ”
68752	68756	68759	68759	her	1338	“ Am I ? ”
68780	68787	68771	68771	She	1338	“ Guess I kind of am . ”
68788	68798	68799	68799	He	80	“ Yeah , I guess you kind of are . ”
68917	68943	68944	68944	She	1338	“ Much as I hate to watch you put clothes on , I have to say , you ’re damn cute when you do it . ”
69059	69065	69066	69066	His	80	“ I have to go . ”
69084	69092	69078	69078	She	125	“ What is it ? What happened ? ”
69109	69112	69120	69120	his	80	“ Eli . ”
69162	69169	69170	69170	she	125	“ I ’m coming with you , ”

69283	69292	69293	69293	Bitterness	178	“ Hospital . He was injured last week . ”
69302	69330	69293	69293	Bitterness	178	“ They flew him home to Chicago Memorial . Dad knew — received the call when it happened — but Eli demanded he keep that to himself . ”
69331	69341	69348	69348	his	80	“ So that was your dad on the phone ? ”
69342	69345	69346	69346	Tag	80	“ Yeah . ”
69351	69367	69348	69348	his	80	“ He said Eli was out of surgery and Reese and Merina were already there . ”
69392	69404	69386	69386	Tag	80	“ I do n’t even know what he had surgery for . ”
69405	69410	69437	69437	they	284	“ I ’m sorry . ”
69540	69554	69555	69555	he	80	“ My family has n’t seen me with a woman in a decade , ”
69564	69570	69555	69555	he	80	“ Expect some shocked expressions . ”
69580	69589	69597	69597	he	80	“ Not something I make a habit of . ”
69820	69829	69817	69817	Tag	80	“ Nice of you to let me know . ”
69877	69887	69888	69888	She	1373	“ We only just found out ourselves , Tag . ”

70143	70156	70134	70134	he	80	“ I do n’t want a lecture from either one of you . ”
70157	70170	70171	70171	Reese	91	“ We should know what ’s happened before we go in there , ”
70205	70210	70211	70211	Alex	98	“ We ’re ready , ”
70218	70238	70211	70211	Alex	98	“ Reese . You ’re the oldest . You first . I ’ll go in with you and Merina . ”

82090	82114	82115	82115	She	125	“ That was probably the champagne talking . I ’m all for taking you to bed , but — what are you doing ? ”
82190	82202	82184	82184	she	125	“ Tell Bill up there to take the long way home . ”
82203	82215	82184	82184	she	125	“ Honey , I ’ll tell him to take all night . ”
82254	82258	82249	82249	She	125	“ Do it . ”
82279	82462	82276	82276	She	125	” Rachel groaned as she stepped out of his bedroom wearing his button - down shirt from last night and dragging the blanket from the bed along with her . Her hair was a tangled blond mess , her legs bare and beautiful , and every last thing he did with her in the limo flickered through his head like a movie . Pushing her skirt up her thighs . Peeling her panties down her legs . Going down on her on the seat while she writhed , and when she was wet and ready sliding all the way home . Okay , enough of that or he ’d develop a limp from the hard - on already trying to make an appearance this morning . He could n’t get enough of this woman . She ’d saturated his life , and he ’d soaked her in , allowing her to take up most of his space . For a guy who liked free rein of said space , he found he did n’t mind as much as he ’d have thought . “
82466	82477	82276	82276	She	125	” he greeted , pouring her a cup of coffee . “
82482	82483	82479	82479	ya	1624	” “
82490	82510	82479	82479	ya	1624	” She plopped on his couch , and he walked into the living room , her coffee in hand . “
82526	82527	82529	82529	you	1624	” “
82531	82532	82529	82529	you	1624	” “
82542	82543	82540	82540	Dimples	125	” “
82548	82571	82572	82572	I	0	” Next to her , he pushed her hair off her face and leaned in to lay a kiss on her mouth . “
82591	82592	82593	82593	I	0	” “
82597	82612	82593	82593	I	0	” she said against the rim of her mug , but she was smiling . “
82620	82621	82593	82593	I	0	” “
82637	82649	82593	82593	I	0	” He planned on presenting the plans for the Oahu bar . “
82656	82657	82651	82651	you	1624	” “
82667	82725	82593	82593	I	0	” He barely managed a saccharine smile . There was no love lost between the board that had stuck their noses in his business then out again , then asked for details at the last minute . But he understood it was part of the Crane gig . Plus , he was damn proud of those plans . “
82741	82751	82736	82737	the server	1602	” Eyes bright , she turned to face him . “
82771	82979	83014	83014	Knock	204	” As she talked , he listened , admiring her pluck and her ability and the fact she was wearing a blanket in his penthouse . She looked at home here . She looked like his . The thought sent him down another path , one laced with women who had been in this very penthouse , on this very couch , looking sleepy and satisfied like the girl there now . Thoughts about morning sex and breakfast and shared showers were nothing new , but this was the first time he ’d ever thought the woman on his couch looked like she belonged with him . To him . Maybe this was how it happened . The beginning of what Luc and Gena had . He remembered his best friend after he ’d met Gena . Luc was a changed man . Walked around constantly with a goofy smile on his face . He was exclusive from the start with her . Tag was always exclusive with the women he saw , right up until the point he let them go . Right about now , he would plan his escape , work out the details of how to send the girl on his couch packing . “
83002	83008	83014	83014	Knock	204	” she finished with zest . “
83012	83013	83014	83014	Knock	204	” “
83018	83032	83014	83014	Knock	204	” She sipped her coffee and hummed in the back of her throat . “
83043	83047	83033	83033	Your	1628	” he asked . “
83055	83056	83033	83033	Your	1628	” “
83060	83061	83033	83033	Your	1628	” “
83064	83099	83033	83033	Your	1628	” She bit down on her lip and elevated her coffee cup . He put a hand on her knee and watched her , waiting . Seconds ticked by before she rolled her eyes . “
83107	83108	83102	83102	I	0	” “
83115	83120	83111	83111	you	1628	” he said easily . “
83129	83130	83121	83121	I	0	” “
83134	83186	83121	83121	I	0	” His chest hammered at the surprise those words caused , and more surprise coated him as he realized he was surprised . She had roommates , but she ’d stayed here some , too . He guessed he ’d gotten a little used to that arrangement . His forehead creased . “
83202	83206	83194	83194	I	0	” she continued . “
83245	83250	83224	83224	I	0	” Her face scrunched . “
83257	83258	83224	83224	I	0	” “
83273	83284	83265	83265	I	0	” He stole her coffee mug and took a sip . “
83291	83297	83287	83287	I	0	” She looked genuinely perplexed . “
83300	83319	83287	83287	I	0	” He handed back the mug , once again in the position of being the last to know . “
83365	83366	83362	83362	I	0	” “
83371	83372	83373	83373	Bree	88	” “
83430	83431	83422	83422	I	0	” “
83436	83446	83449	83449	I	0	” he asked , unsure what he was offering . “
83462	83539	83457	83457	you	0	” She touched her finger to his chin and rubbed his beard . He frowned , irked , though he was n’t sure why . He wanted do something — help somehow . Maybe he was irked that she had n’t asked for his help . He owned a damn apartment building . He knew about rentals and the area . It would only make sense to ask him his opinion , but she had n’t . “
83557	83558	83547	83547	I	0	” “
83562	83572	83573	83573	Dimples	125	” Her eyes were fierce , her tone angry . “
83575	83576	83573	83573	Dimples	125	” “
83591	83606	83579	83579	Tag	80	” She pressed her lips into a line , giving him a flat smile . “
83623	83642	83646	83646	me	0	” He blew out a breath of defeat . That stubborn streak of hers was a mile wide . “
83664	83697	83698	83698	You	0	” She would n’t let him help her with the place to live , fine , but he could at least get her transportation for the day . She shook her head . “
83718	83724	83706	83706	I	0	” Her turn to sigh . “
83732	83733	83706	83706	I	0	” “
83741	83742	83739	83739	you	0	” “
83745	83764	83739	83739	you	0	” Her giving him that inch made him feel as triumphant as if he ’d won a mile . “
83776	83777	83771	83771	You	0	” “
83784	83795	83771	83771	You	0	” he asked as he dialed on his cell phone . “
83808	83815	83801	83801	I	0	” she replied with a wink . “
83822	83822	83801	83801	I	0	”
83842	83852	83829	83829	Tag	80	“ Construction starts tomorrow . Oahu is the test . ”
83869	83878	83879	83879	Frank	92	“ This is some nice work , Tag , ”
83902	83913	83915	83915	Lilith	94	“ This is definitely one way to go about it , ”
83958	83971	83949	83949	Frank	92	“ Now . Who ’s going to Dylan ’s for Cobb salad ? ”
84020	84036	84015	84015	Tag	80	“ What do you call a group of lemmings ? A herd or a pack ? ”
84037	84041	84042	84042	Reese	91	“ No idea . ”
84050	84067	84042	84042	Reese	91	“ I guess Frank ’s comment is as close to a compliment as you can expect . ”
84068	84071	84072	84072	Tag	80	“ Whatever . ”
84084	84093	84072	84072	Tag	80	“ I do n’t need to be coddled . ”
84094	84097	84098	84098	Reese	91	“ Tag , ”
84104	84108	84098	84098	Reese	91	“ Great work . ”
84118	84123	84098	84098	Reese	91	“ Thanks , bro . ”
84124	84132	84133	84133	Reese	91	“ Too bad you ’re dating her , ”
84144	84147	84133	84133	Reese	91	“ Why ? ”
84160	84174	84175	84175	Reese	91	“ Rachel ’s smart . Knows more about business than your average bartender . ”
84183	84214	84175	84175	Reese	91	“ She ’d fit in around here , but I ’m guessing when you break up with her , you do n’t want to bump into her at the office . ”
84231	84237	84225	84225	his	80	“ Something on your mind ? ”
84246	84262	84240	84240	his	91	“ You ’re not in a hurry to blow this one off , are you ? ”
84263	84274	84225	84225	his	80	“ Since when do you care about my love life ? ”
84275	84288	84289	84289	His	80	“ Since you referred to it as a ‘ love ’ life . ”
84300	84318	84225	84225	his	80	“ She does n’t want to be entangled with Crane money and me at the same time . ”
84319	84324	84325	84325	Reese	91	“ I respect that . ”
84328	84331	84332	84332	Tag	80	“ Yeah ? ”
84361	84385	84359	84359	herself	125	“ You may have found the first girl you ca n’t appease with money . That ’s probably why she ’s still around . ”
84397	84416	84391	84391	Reese	91	“ Hang on . I do n’t buy my dates , if that ’s what you ’re saying . ”
84422	84435	84391	84391	Reese	91	“ I have money . I spend it . End of story . ”
84436	84463	84391	84391	Reese	91	“ And if you were n’t footing the bill , how many of those dates do you think you ’d have had over the last decade ? ”
84475	84492	84470	84470	Reese	91	“ Rachel being independent is n’t a bad thing . It works for Merina and me . ”
84493	84504	84505	84505	Tag	80	“ You two were married before you liked each other . ”
84512	84530	84507	84507	his	80	“ I think it ’s safe to say your playbook is unique to the two of you . ”
84531	84538	84539	84539	Reese	91	“ Is n’t that the truth , ”
84543	84555	84539	84539	Reese	91	“ I ’m stopping by to see Eli tonight . Coming ? ”
84556	84564	84507	84507	his	80	“ He still in a cheery mood ? ”
84565	84571	84572	84572	Reese	91	“ Oh , the cheeriest , ”
84575	84584	84572	84572	Reese	91	“ The therapist ramped up his rehabilitation today . ”
84585	84600	84601	84601	They	1650	“ I bet his swearing can be heard from here if we listen closely . ”
84626	84633	84634	84634	Reese	91	“ I hate this for him , ”
84641	84654	84634	84634	Reese	91	“ I can fix anything . But I ca n’t fix this . ”
84676	84680	84664	84664	he	80	“ I know . ”
84681	84700	84637	84637	his	91	“ He does n’t want to admit it , but he ’s hurting . And not just physically . ”
84701	84705	84706	84706	Tag	80	“ I know . ”
84735	84749	84750	84750	Reese	91	“ I ’d rather have him without a leg than not at all , ”
84778	84782	84783	84783	Reese	91	“ Tonight then ? ”
84786	84789	84783	84783	Reese	91	“ Yeah . ”
84839	84875	84832	84832	I	0	” Tag blew out a breath and pushed his feet against the machine one final time before dropping the weights with a clang . He leaned forward and snatched his towel , mopping his neck . “
84887	84888	84889	84889	Eli	99	” “
84891	84946	84889	84889	Eli	99	” Lucas grunted , finishing a sit - up before lying flat on his back on the mat . The gym was empty today . Typical for spring . Most of the people who ’d made New Year ’s resolutions to get into shape had given up , leaving the diehards to their workouts . “
84949	84950	84889	84889	Eli	99	” “
84956	84972	84953	84953	he	99	” Lucas did one final sit - up and wrapped his arms around his knees . “
84977	84983	84973	84973	He	99	” Tag lifted an eyebrow . “
84990	85076	84984	84984	He	99	” Last night Reese and Tag had showed up at Eli ’s warehouse apartment to find Eli at the end of a session with his physical therapist . They ’d hired a male therapist , knowing that Eli ’s particularly abrasive attitude might be tempered by a guy he could relate to . The therapist they ’d found was former military , tough , and did n’t take any shit . Eli seemed to be conforming and had done his leg exercises with minimal swearing . “
85089	85120	85077	85077	I	0	” Tag might never get used to it , and he had no idea how the hell Eli felt about it either . His brother had n’t exactly opened up . “
85136	85219	85130	85130	they	1655	” Eli had a big one during dinner — delivered submarine sandwiches . Eli had cried out and slumped over in his chair . Tag had vacillated between unhinged anger that this had happened to one of the best people he knew and the now familiar feeling of helplessness that he could n’t do a damn thing to help Eli through it . After Eli had caught his breath , he ’d left his veggie sub uneaten and retreated to his bedroom . “
85232	85243	85220	85220	He	99	” Lucas said gently , pulling Tag from his thoughts . “
85259	85266	85220	85220	He	99	” God , he hoped so . “
85285	85286	85287	85287	I	0	” “
85290	85315	85287	85287	I	0	” Tag reached for his water bottle . No way was he going to bail on his brother . Eli was stuck with him . “
85325	85326	85327	85327	Rachel	125	” “
85329	85367	85327	85327	Rachel	125	” Lucas said , pushing himself to standing and snagging his own water bottle in the process . Tag stood , too , and Lucas kept smiling , even when he took a drink of his water . “
85376	85386	85327	85327	Rachel	125	” Seriously . Lucas looked like the freaking Joker . “
85393	85428	85429	85429	You	80	” Tag tossed his towel over his shoulder and angled for the exit . He knew exactly what Lucas was talking about , and frankly , he did n’t want to talk about it . “
85433	85456	85457	85457	You	80	” Lucas followed him out of Crane Tower ’s gym and into the elevator . Tag punched the button for his penthouse . “
85466	85474	85457	85457	You	80	” he grumbled as they rode up . “
85496	85497	85457	85457	You	80	” “
85500	85513	85457	85457	You	80	” Tag stepped out on his floor and opened his front door . “
85525	85526	85527	85527	Lucas	131	” “
85531	85588	85527	85527	Lucas	131	” Tag elevated his arms , half pissed , half terrified at what his best friend was about to say . Because he knew . God help him , Tag knew exactly what Lucas was about to say . Then with an even bigger shit - eating grin , Lucas stabbed the air and told him . “
85593	85594	85589	85589	You	80	” “
85598	85609	85589	85589	You	80	” Tag tossed a hand and walked to his bedroom . “
85615	85622	85589	85589	You	80	” But Lucas was n’t shaken . “
85639	85717	85634	85634	You	80	” Tag stopped in the doorway and regarded the ceiling , looking for what , he was n’t sure . Strength ? Answers ? A clue Lucas was wrong ? Spun was a term they ’d used when one by one their friends began falling victims to women , losing their single status and voluntarily handing over their man cards . Lucas was among the last , save for Tag , who ’d kept the dream alive . “
85738	85742	85722	85722	I	0	” Luc said . “
85756	85757	85722	85722	I	0	” “
85763	85784	85722	85722	I	0	” Tag so did not want to have this convo with his best bud . Not now . Not ever . “
85791	85800	85785	85785	I	0	” Luc put a palm to his chest . “
85826	85835	85823	85823	his	1661	” He gave his head a reverent shake . “
85848	85849	85850	85850	Lucas	131	” “
85857	85858	85850	85850	Lucas	131	” “
85894	85922	85923	85923	You	131	” Tag took a deep breath and wondered if he marched over and punched Lucas in the face if he ’d shut up or hit him back . “
85937	85941	85933	85933	you	131	” Lucas continued . “
85978	85979	85965	85965	you	131	” “
85990	85994	85985	85985	I	0	” Tag bellowed . “
86037	86065	86025	86025	You	131	” Without waiting for Lucas ’s response , Tag shut his bedroom door , but through the wood , he heard his so - called friend comment , “
86074	86179	86025	86025	You	131	” Tag kicked off his sneakers and went to the bathroom sink , bracing his hands on the edges . He regarded his reflection , a slightly sweaty guy who needed a shower and a slap in the face . Wake up , man . He had n’t practiced the three - word bomb in the mirror like Lucas had suggested , and he would n’t do it now . But Tag was beginning to think he ’d lied to his best friend — that he ’d been lying to himself . Because right now the Tag in the mirror looked both scared and spun .
86481	86486	86461	86461	Rachel	125	“ Hi , Mom . ”
86487	86519	86537	86537	Rachel	125	“ Hey , sweetheart ! I had n’t heard from you in a while so I assumed you ’ve been busy with work and watching the big dog for your friend . ”
86520	86536	86461	86461	Rachel	125	“ You ’re right about busy , but I ’m not dog sitting any longer . ”
86607	86623	86599	86599	she	125	“ … And your cousin Sheryl is pregnant . So the wedding should be interesting . ”
86624	86627	86599	86599	she	125	“ Really . ”
86628	86636	86637	86638	Her mother	282	“ I know . Scandal , right ? ”
86648	86672	86637	86638	Her mother	282	“ But she ’s only ten weeks , so it ’s not like she ’s walking down the aisle with a baby bump . ”
86680	86687	86677	86677	Rachel	125	“ I ’m happy for her . ”
86688	86700	86701	86701	she	125	“ Yes , so am I. Rich is a nice man , ”
86708	86714	86701	86701	she	125	“ How ’s work going ? ”
86715	86723	86724	86724	Her	125	“ Well . It ’s going well . ”
86756	86769	86770	86770	she	125	“ I do n’t actually have the job you ’re referring to , ”
86774	86795	86770	86770	she	125	“ I did n’t want to tell you because then I ’d have to tell you how Shaun betrayed me . ”
86796	86804	86805	86806	Her mom	2370	“ Rachel . What do you mean ? ”
86812	86824	86805	86806	Her mom	2370	“ It ’s his fault you do n’t have a job ? ”
86825	86838	86839	86839	She	125	“ It ’s my fault I do n’t have my marketing job . ”
86858	86875	86879	86879	she	125	“ But I do have a job . Just not one where high heels are standard . ”
86930	86937	86924	86924	Tag	80	“ Are you and Tag … ? ”
86938	86945	86924	86924	Tag	80	“ We ’re seeing each other . ”
86985	86999	86982	86982	Baby	208	“ I helped him out with a bar project recently . In Hawaii . ”
87000	87003	87020	87020	Rachel	125	“ Hawaii ! ”
87004	87019	87020	87020	Rachel	125	“ I did n’t want you to worry . Or get the wrong idea , ”
87042	87060	87030	87031	her mom	2370	“ Anyway , he wanted to pay me for going , but I did n’t let him . ”
87061	87065	87020	87020	Rachel	125	“ Smart girl . ”
87092	87125	87075	87076	Her mother	282	“ It ’s been a few weeks and I have n’t had any luck finding a corporate job , but there is an opening at … uh , the place Tag works . ”
87126	87137	87138	87138	Rachel	125	“ Would he put in a good word for you ? ”
87154	87167	87146	87146	You	1691	“ That ’s just it . I do n’t want him to . ”
87186	87201	87146	87146	You	1691	“ Do you think it ’d be wrong to apply and not tell him ? ”
87202	87217	87218	87219	her mother	282	“ I think you should apply , and I think you should tell him , ”
87224	87234	87218	87219	her mother	282	“ I do n’t want him pulling any strings . ”
87235	87241	87242	87242	Rachel	125	“ Then tell him so . ”
87245	87264	87242	87242	Rachel	125	“ Do n’t start off your relationship with a lie , Rach . It wo n’t end well . ”
87359	87364	87365	87365	she	125	“ Thanks , Mom , ”
87369	87375	87365	87365	she	125	“ That ’s good advice . ”
87376	87385	87386	87386	They	1699	“ That ’s what I ’m here for . ”
87393	87397	87365	87365	she	125	“ I love yous ”
87630	87637	87638	87638	His	80	“ What are you best at ? ”
87662	87670	87645	87645	he	80	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
87694	87710	87711	87711	His	80	“ I ’ve created a monster . Told you that you were good in bed . ”
87774	87811	87760	87772	A long - haired , bearded , wide - bodied , addictive drug	1710	“ I ’m asking about your skills outside of my mattress , Dimples . What skills did you highlight on your resume ? There has to be a reason you ’re not turning up any leads . ”
87855	87864	87865	87865	Tag	80	“ Are you sure marketing is your bag ? ”
87885	87901	87865	87865	Tag	80	“ Do you like sales ? Would you like to work in the service industry ? ”
87902	87911	87912	87912	she	125	“ I do work in the service industry , ”
87918	87935	87912	87912	she	125	“ You know what I mean . Would you like to do something like I do ? ”
87936	87944	87945	87945	She	125	“ What is it that you do ? ”
87953	87964	87945	87945	She	125	“ Travel , party , write your own dress code … ”
88027	88036	88037	88037	He	80	“ Is this conversation too responsible for you ? ”
88059	88069	88070	88070	She	125	“ Yes . I ’d like to be irresponsible . ”
88129	88143	88120	88120	his	80	“ Are you staying with me tonight ? I ’ll make you breakfast . ”
88144	88152	88153	88153	she	125	“ How can I turn down breakfast ? ”
88160	88169	88153	88153	she	125	“ You make better coffee than my roommates . ”
88170	88176	88177	88177	She	125	“ My view is better . ”

94853	94865	94842	94842	you	109	” He moved his mouth away from the phone to ask , “
94870	94871	94868	94868	Dimples	125	” “
94878	94879	94868	94868	Dimples	125	” “
94882	94887	94868	94868	Dimples	125	” he told Fiona . “
94890	94896	94868	94868	Dimples	125	” He ended the call . “
94900	94901	94902	94902	She	1806	” “
94913	94914	94902	94902	She	1806	” “
94925	94981	94915	94916	Crane Tower	3	” Rachel sent him a grateful smile . Even with damp eyelashes , she looked a hell of a lot more relaxed than she did when she opened his front door . He hated that she had to work like a dog this week . He hated to see her this exhausted . This spent . “
94988	94995	94915	94916	Crane Tower	3	” He held out a palm . “
94998	95005	94915	94916	Crane Tower	3	” she said around a bite . “
95022	95023	95007	95007	I	0	” “
95033	95040	95041	95041	You	0	” she said with a headshake . “
95062	95066	95067	95067	You	0	” She frowned . “
95083	95084	95080	95080	your	0	” “
95088	95093	95094	95094	I	0	” Her frown deepened . “
95103	95124	95094	95094	I	0	” Her dedication blew him away . He admired that as much as he admired every other part of her . “
95139	95149	95135	95135	You	0	” He knew her answer before she gave it . “
95200	95201	95190	95191	two servers	1811	” “
95228	95229	95210	95210	Dimples	125	” “
95235	95245	95210	95210	Dimples	125	” she asked as he walked to his bedroom . “
95253	95253	95210	95210	Dimples	125	”
95401	95407	95408	95408	he	80	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
95427	95436	95437	95437	Rachel	125	“ How many of those have they ordered ? ”
95447	95460	95437	95437	Rachel	125	“ I ’m keeping track in my head . Do n’t worry . ”
95461	95486	95487	95487	She	125	“ I ’m not worried about you undercharging . I ’m worried they ’ll be falling - down drunk by the time they leave . ”
95493	95524	95489	95489	her	125	“ Although , one of those girls is suspiciously sober . I think she ’s ordering so you ’ll turn around to pour and she can look at your ass . ”
95525	95529	95530	95530	He	1825	“ You think ? ”
95533	95536	95530	95530	He	1825	“ Careful . ”
95537	95548	95549	95549	he	1825	“ In the business , we call this tip talk , ”
95563	95574	95549	95549	he	1825	“ Just you watch how many tips I earn you . ”
95674	95686	95665	95665	He	1825	“ Did I tell you , or did I tell you ? ”
95687	95708	95726	95726	Her	2481	“ I hate to break it to you , but the biggest number on those receipts was a phone number . ”
95709	95725	95726	95726	Her	2481	“ One of them left a C - note , princess . Check your till . ”
95731	95734	95735	95735	He	1825	“ Seriously ? ”
95743	95748	95735	95735	He	1825	“ Tip talk master . ”
95763	95775	95776	95776	She	2481	“ We ’re half - assing cleanup . I ’m dead . ”
95814	95817	95818	95818	Tag	80	“ Samuel , ”
95832	95844	95825	95825	his	1825	“ I need a car to the Andromeda Club in five . ”
95850	95860	95861	95861	He	1825	“ Yep . That ’s the one . Thanks . ”
95875	95887	95888	95888	He	1825	“ Stay put , Dimples . I ’ll grab your coat . ”
95903	95909	95888	95888	He	1825	“ What are you doing ? ”
95925	95963	95888	95888	He	1825	“ I ’m going to clean the bar , lock up , and make sure your kitchen guys do their shit . You ’re going back to my place and you ’re going to get some sleep . ”
95964	95969	95970	95970	He	1825	“ Tag , no . ”
95995	96023	96024	96024	He	1825	“ I run Guest and Restaurant Services for a massive hotel conglomerate . I can handle shutting down a bar . You ’re going to my house . ”
96035	96054	96024	96024	He	1825	“ Then you ’re going to put on one of my T - shirts and climb into bed . ”
96172	96175	96190	96190	Tag	80	“ Coffee . ”
96267	96277	96278	96278	he	80	“ Sure you do n’t want to call in ? ”
96285	96291	96281	96281	his	80	“ What time is it ? ”
96299	96304	96305	96305	She	125	“ Ten till six . ”
96308	96314	96305	96305	She	125	“ Can you make it ? ”
96315	96321	96322	96322	She	125	“ I can make it . ”
96336	96344	96322	96322	She	125	“ Thank you . For last night . ”
96345	96354	96322	96322	She	125	“ You do n’t have to thank me . ”
96355	96365	96322	96322	She	125	“ I could n’t have done it without you . ”
96572	96643	96561	96561	Bree	88	“ We ’re moving out this weekend , Rach . I ’m so sorry to do this to you , but we were told the house was available sooner than we thought , and a friend of ours offered to take over our lease here , meaning we wo n’t be penalized for leaving early . I figured since you were with Tag and you had a place to stay — ”
96644	96651	96652	96652	Rachel	125	“ No penalty from me either , ”
96878	96883	96884	96884	Tag	80	“ What is it ? ”
96887	96892	96884	96884	Tag	80	“ What is what ? ”
96893	96904	96952	96952	him	80	“ You were chattering and now you ’re clamming up . ”
96905	96912	96915	96915	she	125	“ No , I ’m not . ”
96931	96934	96952	96952	him	80	“ Dimples . ”
96971	96993	96994	96994	she	125	“ My apartment wo n’t be ready for two weeks . I put a hold on it over the phone today , ”
96997	97002	97003	97003	he	80	“ That ’s great , ”
97007	97018	97003	97003	he	80	“ Bree and Dean need me out by this weekend . ”
97025	97044	97019	97019	She	125	“ I was going to stay at the Crane , but my first paycheck is another week out . ”
97073	97083	97061	97061	he	80	“ I can comp one for you , Dimples . ”
97084	97098	97070	97070	his	80	“ I do n’t want special treatment on the hotel room , Tag . ”
97099	97107	97070	97070	his	80	“ It ’s not a big deal . ”
97108	97114	97061	97061	he	80	“ It is to me . ”
97176	97181	97182	97182	Tag	80	“ So stay here , ”
97205	97220	97199	97199	His	80	“ I could n’t ask you to let me stay here for two weeks . ”
97221	97226	97227	97227	He	80	“ You did n’t . ”
97234	97252	97227	97227	He	80	“ I offered . Pretty much had to since you refuse to use me for my money . ”
97281	97285	97276	97276	he	80	“ Thank you . ”
97286	97295	97296	97296	he	80	“ Use me for my body , instead , ”
97356	97364	97343	97343	She	125	“ We always end up right here . ”
97420	97427	97428	97428	he	80	“ I like you right here , ”
97438	97445	97428	97428	he	80	“ I … like it too . ”
97459	97464	97478	97478	he	80	“ I love you , ”
97497	97505	97506	97506	he	80	“ Now what are you thinking about ? ”
97520	97524	97506	97506	he	80	“ The wedding . ”
97701	97710	97698	97698	she	125	“ My cousin ’s wedding is next weekend . ”
97711	97714	97715	97715	He	80	“ Oh . ”
97724	97727	97715	97715	He	80	“ Tag ? ”
97728	97731	97698	97698	she	125	“ Yeah . ”
97742	97754	97715	97715	He	80	“ You ’re sure it ’s okay if I stay here ? ”
97755	97760	97715	97715	He	80	“ I ’m sure . ”
97859	97867	97868	97868	she	125	“ It will only be two weeks , ”
97871	97881	97868	97868	she	125	“ I can store my things in the meantime . ”
97907	97917	97893	97893	He	80	“ I can take care of that for you . ”
97936	98009	97930	97930	He	80	“ Those are my terms . I ’m not fighting with you about this . You wo n’t let me take care of a room at the Crane for you , then you have to let me help you move . You do n’t have time with two jobs , and Dean and Bree will be too busy moving themselves out to help you . Who else is going to do it ? ”
98022	98029	98016	98016	her	125	“ You make a good point . ”
98156	98160	98161	98161	he	1855	“ Another beer ? ”
98169	98183	98184	98184	He	1855	“ I ’d better not . I ’m still wiped from last night . ”
98240	98258	98259	98259	He	1855	“ I ’m going to go to the gym for an hour or so . You good ? ”
98283	98288	98289	98289	She	125	“ I ’m good . ”
98298	98303	98289	98289	She	125	“ Thank you again . ”
98304	98309	98310	98310	He	1855	“ You ’re welcome . ”
98325	98334	98335	98335	She	125	“ I ’ll take this out , too . ”
98397	98406	98385	98385	He	1855	“ Be back in an hour , Dimples . ”
98407	98410	98411	98411	she	125	“ Tag ? ”
98421	98424	98411	98411	she	125	“ Yeah ? ”
98444	98456	98457	98457	He	1855	“ Do you need me to make up the guest bed ? ”
98475	98483	98484	98484	she	125	“ Sorry . I ’m being weird , ”
98491	98498	98484	98484	she	125	“ Your bed . Of course . ”
98504	98510	98484	98484	she	125	“ Okay , see you . ”
98511	98517	98518	98518	He	1855	“ Yeah , see you . ”
98603	98618	98619	98619	Reese	91	” Bobbie greeted Tag as the elevator deposited him in front of her desk . “
98623	98632	98619	98619	Reese	91	” he asked , forgoing his normal banter . “
98640	98651	98619	98619	Reese	91	” Bobbie ’s ultracasual reaction made him blink in surprise . “
98659	98665	98619	98619	Reese	91	” In so many ways . “
98671	98687	98688	98688	He	91	” She did n’t push him further , simply slipped back into her formal routine . “
98696	98697	98688	98688	He	91	” “
98700	98758	98688	98688	He	91	” Bobbie hit the intercom to announce him , but Tag mashed the button on her desk to open the office doors before she could . Reese , standing at his desk with a palm full of pink WHILE YOU WERE OUT notes , paused flipping through them . Behind Tag , the office doors whooshed shut . “
98767	98768	98764	98765	your therapist	1861	” “
98777	98783	98764	98765	your therapist	1861	” Reese said , droll . “
98791	98792	98793	98793	She	1861	” “
98799	98805	98793	98793	She	1861	” Reese ’s brow crinkled . “
98808	98809	98810	98811	Rachel Foster	81	” “
98813	98839	98810	98811	Rachel Foster	81	” Tag walked to his usual seat , could n’t sit , so he paced to the window . He turned and pointed at Reese . “
98845	98852	98842	98842	your	0	” His brother ’s frown intensified . “
98873	98891	98853	98853	You	0	” He waggled his fingers in front of him , realizing he probably looked and sounded crazed . “
98926	98936	98921	98921	she	1866	” He crammed his hands into his jeans pockets . “
98940	98959	98921	98921	she	1866	” Reese abandoned the notes and came out from behind his desk to stand in front of Tag . “
98965	98966	98960	98960	I	0	” “
98995	98996	98998	99000	a good boyfriend	1869	” “
99008	99042	99003	99003	her	1866	” Reese answered with a shrug . At the word boyfriend , Tag ’s stomach flipped . He ’d once told Rachel he was n’t boyfriend material , and no matter what he was “
99047	99053	99003	99003	her	1866	” that had n’t changed . “
99068	99085	99058	99059	a therapist	1862	” Tag shook his head and bypassed the chair , pushing his fingers into his hair . “
99101	99102	99103	99103	You	0	” “
99107	99125	99103	99103	You	0	” Reese was his usual calm , stoic self , which was what Tag needed right now . “
99154	99160	99141	99141	I	0	” Tag dropped his arms . “
99167	99168	99161	99161	You	0	” “
99171	99202	99161	99161	You	0	” One side of Reese ’s mouth lifted . He gestured to the chair by his desk . Tag dropped into it , one foot bobbing from too much coffee . “
99210	99211	99206	99206	she	1872	” “
99215	99221	99222	99222	She	1872	” Tag scratched his cheek . “
99235	99236	99237	99237	You	0	” “
99248	99292	99237	99237	You	0	” Tag took a deep breath . He was n’t fine . Every passing day , he felt more trapped . Or … not trapped . Stuck . He was freaked . And this morning , he thought he ’d figured out why . “
99315	99319	99299	99299	Mom	82	” Tag asked . “
99337	99346	99320	99320	Dad	84	” Reese frowned , his answer a simple , “
99350	99364	99320	99320	Dad	84	” Tag swallowed down a bout of nausea and forced himself to continue . “
99410	99438	99395	99395	she	82	” And time along with it . The surreal moment played out in slow motion , and Tag caught a glimpse of a future that scared him . “
99447	99459	99439	99439	I	0	” Tag ’s desperate laugh was dry and devoid of humor . “
99467	99556	99439	99439	I	0	” Reese lowered onto his desk , perched on the edge while looking down at Tag , concern evident on his features . Tag said nothing , just waited . There was nothing to say . He was a mental basket case who was freaking out because things were good . Now he was wondering if he ’d missed the window to end things before they turned bad . He had no idea where the self - sabotaging thoughts had come from , so he had come here . “
99561	99568	99439	99439	I	0	” Reese said . Tag flinched . “
99571	99572	99439	99439	I	0	” “
99575	99583	99439	99439	I	0	” Reese stood and smoothed his tie . “
99594	99595	99439	99439	I	0	” “
99601	99618	99439	99439	I	0	” Tag asked with a laugh . Because seriously , what was his brother talking about ? “
99621	99628	99439	99439	I	0	” Reese said , deadly serious . “
99640	99652	99439	99439	I	0	” Tag leaned back in the chair and narrowed his eyes . “
99658	99659	99439	99439	I	0	” “
99702	99703	99704	99704	I	0	” “
99711	99737	99738	99738	You	0	” But man , did the idea of breathing clean ocean air appeal . He could leave his penthouse since it had inexplicably turned stifling . “
99750	99759	99762	99762	yourself	0	” Reese crossed his arms over his chest . “
99775	99801	99762	99762	yourself	0	” Tag remembered when Reese had gone through that . It was a rough patch both he and Merina had miraculously made it through together . “
99822	99874	99762	99762	yourself	0	” He had n’t considered that , but damn , Reese was right . Tag typically traveled so much , he kept an overnight bag packed and ready . He ’d been on one trip over the last several months , and it was n’t a trip he ’d taken alone . “
99880	99899	99762	99762	yourself	0	” Tag said with a nod . A business trip might be just what his fictional therapist ordered . “
99908	99922	99923	99923	I	0	” Reese said with a smile that reflected his pride in finding it . “
99941	99942	99936	99936	we	1883	” “
99945	100011	99936	99936	we	1883	” Tag practically salivated . Crane Miami with its ultra - svelte style and splashy lobby . The entire building lit up hot pink and electric blue at night . He rubbed his hands together , possibility blooming before him . What if Reese was right and what Tag needed was a project to sink his teeth into ? A getaway to clear his head ? “
100014	100030	99936	99936	we	1883	” Breathe . Tag felt like he could breathe for the first time in days . “
100036	100076	100031	100031	I	0	” He ’d overseen grand openings for restaurants and bars for Crane Hotels , but he ’d never been a part of choosing the plot of land one would sit on . He could n’t pass up the opportunity . “
100095	100102	100087	100087	Bobbie	93	” Reese said , then paused . “
100131	100132	100133	100133	I	0	” “
100139	100190	100133	100133	I	0	” The lost look on her face . Her fear that she could n’t tell him about her problems . She was so worried over him providing things for her . Did n’t she see he could ? That he wanted to ? But that was n’t the only reason . “
100196	100207	100208	100208	I	0	” Tag admitted . Reese watched him for a moment . “
100211	100266	100208	100208	I	0	” His brother understood what he was going through . Being understood after feeling like he was losing his marbles was such a relief , Tag blew out a sigh , slightly embarrassed about coming in here and having a meltdown in front of a guy who had a tight grip on his faculties . “
100271	100315	100269	100269	Doc	221	” Tag pushed out of the chair . His brother had suggested he go to Maui for a good reason . Tag needed to go to Maui not only for himself but also for Rachel . For them . Before he went mental . “
100323	100324	100317	100317	I	0	” “
100330	100404	100317	100317	I	0	” Reese said from his desk , flipping through the stack of pink notes again . Tag turned for the door , feeling better and , oddly enough , worse . Part of him felt like he was running , but if he expected to figure out what had him knotted up , Hawaii could hold the answers . In front of Bobbie ’s desk , Tag stopped and sent her a grin . “
100416	100417	100408	100408	you	222	” “
100423	100440	100408	100408	you	222	” Bobbie said with the smile he ’d been trying to tease from her for years . “
100446	100446	100443	100443	you	0	”
100450	100458	100459	100459	Bree	88	“ I already miss you so much ! ”
100478	100485	100486	100486	Rachel	81	“ You are a broken record , ”
100489	100508	100486	100486	Rachel	81	“ I ’ll miss you , too . At least we ’ll work my last shift here together . ”
100509	100513	100519	100519	Bree	88	“ I guess . ”
100522	100545	100519	100519	Bree	88	“ You have a fancy job , and a fancy life , and soon you ’ll be married and living in Tuscany . ”
100546	100554	100519	100519	Bree	88	“ I do n’t even like Tuscany . ”
100555	100563	100519	100519	Bree	88	“ Love makes you do crazy things . ”
100564	100573	100574	100574	Rachel	81	“ I never said I was in love , ”
100589	100597	100581	100581	Bree	88	“ I ’m not blind , Rach . ”
100598	100611	100519	100519	Bree	88	“ Miss , can I get a Monte Cristo sandwich to go ? ”
100651	100663	100664	100664	Rachel	81	“ Besides , I ca n’t be in love with him , ”
100667	100679	100664	100664	Rachel	81	“ I do n’t think he ’s in love with me . ”
100690	100697	100682	100682	her	88	“ Why would you say that ? ”
100698	100707	100708	100708	He	1423	“ Because he flew to Hawaii yesterday morning . ”
100735	100738	100726	100726	Bree	88	“ So ? ”
100739	100776	100682	100682	her	88	“ So ? He ’s been acting downright twitchy since he offered his penthouse as my home away from home , and then yesterday he was bouncing off the walls because he was going to Hawaii . ”
100777	100796	100728	100728	her	88	“ Well , it is Hawaii . And you should n’t be surprised . His job requires traveling . ”
100797	100809	100810	100810	Rachel	81	“ I know he travels . Traveling is not the issue . ”
100820	100841	100814	100814	she	81	“ I ’m excited to hear from him already . Like , I ’m already waiting for him to call . ”
100842	100850	100851	100851	Bree	88	“ That ’s because you love him . ”
100880	100935	100867	100867	He	80	“ He has been gone less than a day , and I miss him so much my chest hurts . I ca n’t help but remember how much I depended on Shaun and how he ended up leaving . Tag has n’t given me any indication we ’ll stay together for the long haul . ”
100936	100949	100950	100950	Rachel	81	“ Do you want to stay with him for the long haul ? ”
100974	100984	100985	100985	Bree	88	“ But he has n’t asked you to leave , ”
100988	101001	101002	101002	Rachel	81	“ No , he ’s been intensely polite about my being there , ”
101053	101081	101044	101044	he	80	“ Shaun slowly cut me loose , too , Bree . Months and months passed by before things imploded . I ca n’t let that happen again . ”
101110	101113	101114	101114	Bree	88	“ Rach . ”
101121	101190	101114	101114	Bree	88	“ It makes sense for you to be nervous about where things are heading . Love is big and scary . You ’re both probably adjusting . I ’ve seen you with him , and I ’ve seen the way he looks at you . He looks like a man in love to me . Maybe he has n’t admitted it yet . To himself or to you . ”
101231	101240	101241	101241	Bree	88	“ Once he calls you ’ll feel better , ”
101244	101269	101241	101241	Bree	88	“ I ’ve said this before , but it bears repeating . Tag is not Shaun . He ’s not plotting your corporate demise . ”
101441	101444	101430	101430	she	81	“ Hi . ”
101453	101458	101459	101459	His	80	“ Hey , Dimples . ”
101484	101491	101492	101492	She	81	“ I hear surf and sand . ”
101520	101527	101528	101528	He	80	“ You ca n’t hear sand . ”
101537	101544	101528	101528	He	80	“ You know what I mean . ”
101545	101562	101528	101528	He	80	“ I do . I wanted to call and check in . Have everything you need ? ”
101563	101571	101572	101572	She	81	“ I ’m not wanting for anything . ”
101600	101605	101592	101592	she	81	“ Except for you . ”
101606	101611	101612	101612	His	80	“ I like that . ”
101622	101630	101612	101612	His	80	“ So . I have good news . ”
101631	101638	101642	101642	her	81	“ The bar design is working ? ”
101661	101691	101644	101644	She	81	“ I think so , but that ’s not the news . I ’m standing on a patch of ground where there will someday be a new Crane Hotel . ”
101692	101699	101700	101700	He	80	“ Did you buy the land ? ”
101712	101762	101763	101763	He	80	“ Not yet , but the Realtor is on his way , and I ’m going to tell him yes . I already called Reese . It ’s perfect . I can envision the direction the hotel will face , where the bars will go — maybe your designs . ”
101785	101790	101791	101791	she	1908	“ That ’s great , ”
101878	101888	101889	101889	she	1908	“ I had a proposition for you , actually , ”
101897	101903	101889	101889	she	1908	“ Let ’s hear it . ”
101956	101962	101963	101963	she	1908	“ When you get back , ”
101966	101981	101963	101963	she	1908	“ I ’d like to take you to my cousin ’s wedding in Ohio . ”

102065	102070	102071	102071	His	80	“ The … wedding ? ”
102088	102093	102094	102094	she	1908	“ It ’s Saturday , ”
102147	102175	102140	102140	She	1908	“ I know you wo n’t be back home until Friday , but we can leave Saturday morning . It ’s only a six - hour drive . ”
102182	102185	102140	102140	She	1908	“ Tag ? ”
102186	102195	102202	102202	his	80	“ I ca n’t . I ’m sorry . ”
102239	102317	102232	102232	He	80	“ I ’ll have a lot of work to catch up on when I ’m back . Especially if I pull the trigger on this deal . Oh , hey , the Realtor is here . I ’ll call later . And , Dimples , do n’t forget , the moving company is scheduled to be at your apartment this afternoon . Make sure they get everything they ’re supposed to into storage for you , okay ? ”
102318	102321	102322	102322	she	1908	“ Sure , ”
102334	102367	102322	102322	she	1908	“ Hey , why do n’t you take my Aston Martin to Ohio ? Unless you prefer flying . I can book you a flight tonight if you text me the particulars . ”
102368	102372	102402	102402	he	1913	“ A flight ? ”
102373	102390	102391	102391	He	1913	“ Whatever you like , Dimples . I ’m happy to help . Got ta go . ”
103068	103079	103080	103080	He	80	“ Hey . I thought you ’d be at work . ”
103095	103102	103103	103103	He	80	“ Mmm . You smell good . ”
103172	103186	103160	103160	She	125	“ You ’re early . I thought you ’d be home later today . ”
103206	103214	103215	103215	His	80	“ I left right after the closing . ”
103223	103231	103215	103215	His	80	“ Dimples , what ’s going on ? ”
103232	103240	103241	103241	she	125	“ I ’m going to Ohio today , ”
103294	103308	103288	103288	she	125	“ Right . Have a nice time . Are you taking my car ? ”
103325	103335	103336	103336	Her	125	“ I ’m not taking your car , Tag . ”
103376	103391	103392	103392	he	80	“ I ’m going to need you to lay out what ’s going on , ”
103395	103402	103392	103392	he	80	“ I do n’t like this . ”
103403	103418	103419	103419	Her	125	“ I did n’t plan on doing this now , but maybe I should … ”
103447	103456	103419	103419	Her	125	“ Things had to end sometime , right ? ”
103483	103487	103488	103488	He	80	“ Hang on . ”
103523	103540	103508	103508	she	125	“ I ’ve had a long , sleepless night . An exhausting flight . Let ’s — ”
103541	103548	103549	103549	Her	125	“ I had fun , Tag . ”
103554	103572	103549	103549	Her	125	“ I do n’t want you to think I have any regrets , because I do n’t . ”
103582	103595	103596	103596	she	125	“ I ca n’t thank you enough for all you ’ve done , ”
103599	103609	103596	103596	she	125	“ You really helped me through a bad patch . ”
103610	103616	103617	103617	He	80	“ Dimples , hang on . ”
103640	103659	103634	103634	His	80	“ I feel like it ’s best to end things now before it gets harder to walk away . ”
103691	103699	103700	103700	he	80	“ Who said anything about walking away ? ”
103705	103709	103710	103710	she	125	“ You did , ”
103714	103807	103710	103710	she	125	“ In a million subtle ways . The way you left for Hawaii after I ’d stayed with you for a few days . The way you have kept me as close as possible in bed , but as far as possible elsewhere . I ’m not angry , Tag . I ’m not . And this is a good thing for you . You ’re off the hook . For the wedding . For the future . It ’s better for both of us if we do n’t drag this out . ”
103823	103834	103710	103710	she	125	“ This is about me not going to a wedding ? ”
103835	103855	103856	103856	She	125	“ It ’s okay . You are who you are , but I need to be who I am . ”
103880	103888	103871	103871	he	80	“ And who are you , Dimples ? ”
103896	103909	103889	103889	She	125	“ A woman who is capable of doing things without your help . ”
103977	103997	104010	104010	he	80	“ You mean now that you ’ve taken everything you needed from me , you ’re good to go ? ”
104013	104054	104055	104055	he	80	“ You found your sexual self and your ability to take no shit from your ex , and you secured the job of your dreams in a building with my goddamn name on it , and now you ’re capable ? ”
104082	104085	104079	104079	him	80	“ no problem ”
104113	104130	104131	104131	he	80	“ Glad I could foot the bill and help you through your life transition , Dimples , ”
104145	104151	104131	104131	he	80	“ That ’s not fair . ”
104152	104156	104157	104157	He	80	“ No shit . ”
104173	104179	104157	104157	He	80	“ Have a nice life . ”
104213	104219	104206	104206	her	125	“ That ’s my cab . ”
104220	104225	104242	104242	She	125	“ Better catch it . ”
104259	104264	104242	104242	She	125	“ Bye , Tag . ”
104281	104286	104287	104287	Lucas	131	“ She dumped you ? ”
104303	104309	104310	104310	he	131	“ Not now , sweets , ”
104316	104324	104310	104310	he	131	“ Daddy needs his brains right now . ”
104443	104448	104449	104449	Tag	80	“ She used me , ”
104468	104473	104465	104465	Lucas	131	“ What ’s funny ? ”
104474	104501	104502	104502	Tag	80	“ You look more confused than angry . Like someone put Shakespeare in front of you and asked you to point out examples of iambic pentameter . ”
104511	104516	104504	104504	his	80	“ Proving my point . ”
104517	104541	104465	104465	Lucas	131	“ I ’m past angry . I was angry an hour ago when I opened the door for her to leave my house . ”
104591	104607	104574	104574	Gena	134	“ Once the baby is down for her nap , I ’ll deal with you . ”
104619	104625	104608	104608	Tag	80	“ What ’d I do ? ”
104626	104635	104636	104636	Lucas	131	“ It ’s what you did n’t do . ”
104653	104657	104650	104650	Tag	80	“ Which was ? ”
104658	104669	104650	104650	Tag	80	“ You could ’ve gone to the wedding with Rachel . ”
104670	104683	104650	104650	Tag	80	“ I have to work . She knows I have to work . ”
104708	104721	104650	104650	Tag	80	“ Uh - huh . Also , you ’re allergic to weddings . ”
104722	104731	104732	104732	Tag	80	“ I ’ve been to plenty of weddings . ”
104766	104772	104773	104773	Lucas	131	“ Never with a date , ”
104790	104816	104773	104773	Lucas	131	“ We did n’t take dates to weddings , because they ’d get diamond - eyed when they stepped up to catch the bouquet toss . ”
104817	104822	104823	104823	Tag	80	“ Diamond - eyed , ”
104841	104850	104835	104835	Luc	133	“ What the fuck is wrong with us ? ”
