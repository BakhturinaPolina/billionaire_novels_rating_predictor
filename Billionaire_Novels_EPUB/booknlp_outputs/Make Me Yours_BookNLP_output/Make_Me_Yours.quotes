14527	14562	14587	14587	her	668	“ I do not think you were a horrible mother . I think we need boundaries , and you need a break . You ’ve been taking care of Lillie for four years now . ”
14563	14571	14572	14572	Eleanor	107	“ So it ’s not about me ? ”

20160	20172	20088	20089	Ms. Terry	178	“ Hi , I ’m Ruby , Lillie ’s new nanny . ”
20173	20179	20180	20180	She	2591	“ Nice to meet you ! ”
20233	20240	20223	20223	I	0	“ Lillie has a new nanny ? ”
20256	20267	20250	20250	I	0	“ Serena Whitehead ? I thought you moved to Charleston . ”
20268	20272	20273	20273	She	2591	“ Ruby Banks ? ”
20278	20319	20273	20273	She	2591	“ It ’s Serena North now . My husband Dr. Phillip North and I just moved back to Oakville with our daughter Whitney . I see you ’re still here . Working as a nanny now ? Is that right ? ”
20340	20355	20322	20322	she	2591	“ Remi needed help , so I agreed to do this for a month . ”
20356	20359	20360	20361	Another woman	809	“ Remi ? ”
20397	20408	20371	20371	She	809	“ What ’s this about Remi ? Who are you ? ”
20409	20419	20420	20420	Serena	129	“ It appears Remington has hired a new nanny . ”
20423	20432	20420	20420	Serena	129	“ Ruby Banks , this is Anita Flagstaff . ”
20433	20436	20437	20437	I	0	“ Hello . ”
20440	20451	20437	20437	I	0	“ Nice to meet you . I have to go . ”
20452	20457	20458	20458	Anita	181	“ Just a minute . ”
20469	20480	20458	20458	Anita	181	“ You ’re the new nanny ? Where ’s Eleanor ? ”
20481	20491	20420	20420	Serena	129	“ I ’m sorry . Why are you asking ? ”
20492	20518	20458	20458	Anita	181	“ I was best friends with Sandra Burnside Key . I want to be sure Lillian and Remi are n’t being … taken advantage of . ”
20519	20524	20458	20458	Anita	181	“ Is that so ? ”
20538	20547	20531	20532	this woman	811	“ Did someone ask you to do that ? ”
20548	20563	20458	20458	Anita	181	“ Of course not . I consider it my duty as Sandy ’s friend . ”
20564	20586	20531	20532	this woman	811	“ Perhaps this is something you should discuss with Remi . I do n’t feel comfortable discussing family matters with strangers . ”
20617	20628	20604	20605	Anita Flagbitch	182	“ Looks like a live - in geisha to me . ”
20629	20641	20642	20642	Serena	129	“ All I know is Phillip better not get any ideas . ”
20652	20658	20642	20642	Serena	129	“ Ruby Banks is trouble . ”
20713	20719	20721	20721	Ma	141	“ casting pearls before swine , ”
21728	21732	21733	21733	Stephen	185	“ Hastings here . ”
21749	21761	21740	21740	It	855	“ What ’s on your mind , Remington ? Psychology Today ? ”
21762	21774	21740	21740	It	855	“ I want to know the latest on the Stellan project . ”
21812	21823	21808	21808	he	185	“ You have n’t asked about Stellan in six months . ”
21824	21832	21835	21835	his	185	“ I ’m asking about it now . ”
21842	21862	21835	21835	his	185	“ Looks like he took some time off . Probably found a glitch or bumped into a patent issue . ”
21863	21921	21808	21808	he	185	“ Let ’s hope it ’s the former . Send him a note . Say I ’m still interested if he ’d like to talk to me and see if there are any rising projects along the same lines out there . I want to be the go - to guy when it comes to military security . ”
21922	21934	21835	21835	his	185	“ You always were . Until you dropped out of sight . ”
21935	21961	21808	21808	he	185	“ Right . I ’ll be doing research on my end , and Stephen , get me an invite to the Empire Investments annual gala . ”
21985	21993	21980	21983	my old Navy buddy	858	“ Are you saying you ’re back ? ”
21994	21999	21980	21983	my old Navy buddy	858	“ I ’m back . ”
22053	22075	22045	22045	Eleanor	107	“ Your daughter is only four once . A large inheritance wo n’t make up for spending time with her father . ”
22539	22549	22550	22550	Drew	154	“ Wait . How long have I been gone ? ”
22574	22580	22550	22550	Drew	154	“ You ’re a nanny ? ”
22592	22607	22608	22608	I	0	“ And you ’re not going to believe how much he ’s paying me . ”
22617	22629	22613	22613	she	870	“ That ’s … a hundred eighty thousand dollars a year ! ”
22630	22634	22635	22635	I	0	“ I know ! ”
22645	22669	22635	22635	I	0	“ I was going to flip out , but then I googled it . Most celebrity nannies make like two hundred a year . ”
22670	22691	22692	22692	She	870	“ So you ’re not the highest paid nanny in America . I guess you ’ll have to keep looking … ”
22706	22741	22702	22702	she	870	“ You know , I had a feeling Remi was well - off , but hell . I did n’t know he was that rich . What is he ? Bill Gates ’s kid ? ”
22742	22765	22635	22635	I	0	“ I do n’t think Bill Gates is old enough to have a son Remi ’s age . He ’s only thirty . ”
22766	22774	22775	22775	I	0	“ Have you slept with him yet ? ”
22779	22787	22775	22775	I	0	“ He ’s my boss , Drew . ”
22788	22794	22635	22635	I	0	“ Well , have you ? ”
22800	22807	22795	22795	She	872	“ He ’s hot as fuck . ”
22808	22815	22824	22824	him	873	“ You can say that again . ”
22835	22844	22824	22824	him	873	“ But I ’m a professional childcare provider . ”
22845	22852	22795	22795	She	872	“ Why should that stop you ? ”
22853	22868	22869	22869	My	0	“ I could n’t keep working for him if I was sleeping with him . ”
22882	22903	22869	22869	My	0	“ I ’d have to give up this amazing job … give up the chance at finally being financially independent . ”
22932	22948	22927	22927	She	872	“ So are you going to sleep with him ? We both start laughing harder . “
22955	22956	22927	22927	She	872	” “
22962	22963	22927	22927	She	872	” “
22968	23068	22927	22927	She	872	” Only Drew would know exactly the predicament I ’m in — brain versus hormones . Is n’t the brain controlled by hormones ? I ’m in trouble . A glance at the clock tells me I have about an hour before I have to pick up Lillie . Walking down the stairs , I stop on the landing at the second floor and see Remi at his impressive workstation , frowning at an enormous computer screen . Those hazel eyes quirk up to meet mine , and the frown is replaced with that smile . My stomach tightens . “
23071	23085	22927	22927	She	872	” He slides back and stands , walking to where I ’m waiting . “
23109	23115	23105	23105	your	0	” That makes me grin . “
23130	23193	23105	23105	your	0	” He nods , and I notice his bare feet again . He ’s in those jeans , but this time he ’s wearing a maroon tee that shows off his toned arms . Those biceps … I remember him lifting Lillie this morning at breakfast and how they flexed . It takes all my willpower not to exhale a delighted sigh . “
23204	23247	23200	23200	Eleanor	107	” He walks back into his office , and I follow , noting that ass , wondering how much I should share with him about my earlier power struggle . I guess he did say Eleanor was driving him crazy , too . “
23266	23267	23248	23248	I	0	” “
23275	23293	23248	23248	I	0	” He stops at his desk and looks up at me with that panty - melting smile . “
23297	23329	23332	23332	she	107	” The way he says it , it ’s almost like a joke , like he knew it was coming all along . I guess that makes me feel less guilty ? “
23360	23361	23357	23357	she	91	” “
23375	23376	23362	23362	I	0	” “
23379	23388	23362	23362	I	0	” Now I ’m confident he ’ll understand . “
23417	23418	23419	23419	I	0	” “
23435	23436	23432	23432	I	0	” “
23448	23462	23444	23444	She	91	” The words are out before I realize what I ’ve just said . “
23467	23549	23552	23552	you	880	” His smile changes from panty melting to flat out want . His hand twitches , and I can imagine going to him , putting my hand on his shoulder and pulling our mouths together . I imagine straddling his lap , him lifting my shirt over my head , pulling on my nipple with his lips … Oh , hell , I ’m already wet . I want to bone my boss . Bone my boss … Yes , please . “
23559	23574	23552	23552	you	880	” My breath is shallow , and he returns to where I ’m standing . “
23581	23582	23577	23577	she	881	” “
23591	23606	23607	23607	You	880	” His chin drops , and it ’s like he ’s baring his soul . “
23630	23631	23625	23625	you	880	” “
23638	23642	23635	23635	I	0	” Can I ? “
23648	23674	23635	23635	I	0	” We ’re so close , and today his scent is less earthy and more soap and sexy man - scent . It ’s delicious . “
23688	23708	23709	23709	Lord	886	” He looks up at me from under his brow , and Oh , sweet Jesus , those eyes . “
23714	23719	23709	23709	Lord	886	” I gently tease . “
23734	23744	23745	23745	Dads	889	” I do n’t want to get into that . “
23747	23752	23745	23745	Dads	889	” He exhales deeply . “
23781	23812	23821	23822	distant fathers	891	” The tone in his voice pulls at my chest , and his eyes are so earnest . They capture my heart . I swallow the tightness in my throat . “
23830	23831	23824	23824	You	0	” “
23838	23853	23854	23854	Eleanor	107	” The muscle in his jaw moves , and he looks over my shoulder . “
23907	23925	23926	23926	Everyone	390	” Reaching out , I touch his arm . It feels so good , warm and strong . “
23944	23954	23933	23933	You	91	” He puts a hand on top of mine . “
23977	23978	23966	23966	I	0	” “
24001	24018	23989	23989	she	91	” Our hands lower . He ’s still holding mine , and instinctively our fingers thread . “
24069	24070	24072	24072	you	91	” “
24082	24088	24089	24089	I	0	” His voice is lower . “
24092	24200	24201	24201	I	0	” His eyes drop to my mouth , and my tongue slips out to touch my bottom lip . His gaze stays there , and his lips part . God , I want to kiss him . Tightness fills my stomach , and I sway forward , lifting my chin . Warm breath skates over my cheek … It ’s happening . We ’re going to kiss . My heart beats so fast . He leans closer . My chest aches from the pressure . Perhaps we ’ll meet in the middle . His eyes move across my cheek like a caress , up to my eyes . “
24219	24220	24211	24211	you	896	” “
24223	24232	24211	24211	you	896	” The word floats out on an exhale . “
24238	24239	24242	24242	you	896	” “
24244	24329	24242	24242	you	896	” Because , yes . Yes , he is . He leans a little closer , and the heat between us is right there . It ’s fire , a burning ring of fire , like the song . Our hands are still joined , an electric connection , sparks in our fingertips . I exhale a whimper , a plea for more . I ’m slippery and wet , vibrating and magnetic . He inhales again , placing his hand on my shoulder . “
24335	24395	24396	24396	Ruby	92	” My shirt is so thin , I ’m sure my nipples will rip through the fabric . I want to reach forward and slide my hand along the front of his pants , feel the erection I know he has . One step forward , my chin lifts . My eyes slide close , and my breath stills … “
24398	24411	24396	24396	Ruby	92	” Eleanor shouts my name so loud , we both jump apart . “
24416	24420	24396	24396	Ruby	92	” I whisper . “
24438	24502	24430	24430	they	897	” She ’s coming up the stairs . She ’s almost to the landing , and I go to the door . Remi turns his back and steps out the open French doors onto the small balcony . He did n’t even touch me , but I smooth my hair and straighten my blouse . I ’m hot and bothered and breathing fast . “
24507	24513	24430	24430	they	897	” My voice is wobbly . “
24518	24557	24515	24515	you	92	” Eleanor pauses at the door , and her eyes narrow suspiciously . I pass her , going out to the landing , without a backwards glance at my boss . My boss . Remi is my boss . “
24566	24584	24558	24558	I	0	” My voice is light , not breathless . Eleanor pivots and follows me down the stairs . “

24599	24611	24588	24588	your	92	” I lift my wrist and tap on my Apple watch . “
24616	24626	24627	24627	I	0	” She leans forward to look over my shoulder . “
24643	24669	24627	24627	I	0	” Her tone makes it clear she wants to know how I could afford an Apple watch . Like it ’s any of her business . “
24679	24680	24671	24671	I	0	” “
24690	24691	24687	24688	my mom	2373	” “

24724	24740	24687	24688	my mom	2373	” She grins , and her eyes narrow as if she ’s sizing me up . “

24793	24831	24790	24791	a babysitter	905	” I already had this conversation with my mother ; now I ’m having it with the Dark Lord . Lordess ? But while Ma is overly helpful , Eleanor is manipulative , controlling , and pouty . “
24842	24843	24838	24838	She	91	” “
24850	24851	24852	24852	Remi	91	” “
24884	24903	24863	24863	He	907	” I could n’t resist tossing in that jab . Church ladies love being so holier than thou . “
24930	24953	24919	24919	you	92	” I ’m pretty sure she ’s trying to insult me , but I ’ve never worried about my reputation in Oakville . “
24960	24961	24963	24963	you	92	” “
24965	24970	24963	24963	you	92	” Her eyes flare . “
24978	24999	24974	24974	you	92	” I pause , considering her question , how to answer , and I decide to give her the truth . “
25020	25021	25024	25025	a husband	911	” “

25046	25068	25024	25025	a husband	911	” I pat my watch and give her a perky smile as I walk out the door . Nice try , Eleanor .

25359	25382	25344	25344	Lillie	91	“ Ruby ’s making me pigs in blankets ! Only they ’re not really pigs . They ’re little bitty hot dogs ! ”
25424	25439	25440	25440	She	135	“ It ’s crescent rolls around cocktail weenies . I hope that ’s okay . ”
25453	25466	25440	25440	She	135	“ I think it sounds great . Are there enough for me ? ”

25730	25749	25750	25750	Her	91	“ Not quite . Do n’t you want some pigs in blankets ? Did I eat your lunch ? ”
25755	25787	25750	25750	Her	91	“ I had a late breakfast . I ’m good . By the way , having lunch with your daughter pretty much confirms you ’re not a distant or detached father . ”

25895	25912	25876	25876	She	91	“ That ’s a really nice scene . I ’d like to try painting with Lillie . ”
25913	25918	25876	25876	She	91	“ Do you paint ? ”
25919	25924	25925	25925	She	91	“ Just for fun . ”

26537	26553	26556	26556	She	107	“ Roasted beets with organic kale , avocado , and a splash of balsamic vinaigrette . ”
26608	26621	26595	26595	She	107	“ I have a little more work to do tonight . Thanks . ”
26622	26628	26629	26629	Eleanor	107	“ You work too much . ”
26648	26655	26641	26642	The server	940	“ None for me , thanks ! ”
26664	26674	26656	26656	I	0	“ I still have work to do , too . ”
26684	26693	26681	26681	I	0	“ Lillie wo n’t put herself to bed ! ”
26694	26697	26700	26700	her	107	“ Honestly , ”
26703	26720	26700	26700	her	107	“ One glass of wine wo n’t hurt you . It ’s actually good for you . ”
26721	26728	26729	26729	Lillie	91	“ What ’s this red thing ? ”
26738	26745	26729	26729	Lillie	91	“ It ’s called a beet . ”
26752	26760	26748	26748	her	91	“ Do n’t play with your food . ”
26797	26803	26804	26804	She	91	“ It tastes like dirt ! ”
26829	26840	26817	26817	Eleanor	107	“ And how do you know what dirt tastes like ? ”
26841	26856	26857	26857	Lillie	91	“ Louie made us all eat dirt to prove we could be good soldiers . ”
26862	26876	26880	26880	he	941	“ I can eat dirt . I ’m going to be a general . ”
26890	26904	26905	26905	Eleanor	107	“ Take it from me , soldiers do n’t eat dirt , honey . ”
26911	26938	26905	26905	Eleanor	107	“ While I admire your fortitude , Lillian , you are not to eat dirt at school or anywhere . That ’s how you get worms . ”
26979	27000	26969	26969	she	91	“ What kind of worms ? Earthworms are friendly worms , but they wiggle so fast when you touch them . ”
27013	27025	27026	27026	Eleanor	107	“ I ’m going to have a talk with your teacher , ”
27045	27055	27035	27037	the male server	942	“ Miss Terry says dirt has minerals in it . ”
27068	27107	27062	27062	I	0	“ It ’s true . Pica is a medical condition where patients crave dirt and other non - nutritive substances . Researchers later found many of them were anemic and deficient in other minerals like iron and zinc . ”
27108	27121	27062	27062	I	0	“ So you ’re saying Lillian should be allowed to eat dirt ? ”
27140	27145	27146	27146	I	0	“ Of course not . ”
27151	27161	27146	27146	I	0	“ I only mean it should n’t hurt her . ”
27162	27165	27166	27166	Eleanor	107	“ Lillian , ”
27172	27180	27166	27166	Eleanor	107	“ I forbid you to eat dirt . ”
27190	27198	27187	27187	I	0	“ It ’s not a good idea . ”
27219	27239	27199	27201	The female server	945	“ Free - range pork chops and mashed , organic sweet potatoes locally grown right here in Pike County . ”
27270	27279	27280	27280	Remi	91	“ This ought to be good for us . ”
27296	27301	27302	27303	The female	949	“ It ’s delicious . ”
27310	27321	27322	27322	Lillie	91	“ Daddy and I had pigs in blankets for lunch ! ”
27342	27353	27336	27336	Eleanor	107	“ Who in the world gave you that ? Remington ? ”
27365	27389	27360	27360	Lillie	91	“ Ruby made them , and I helped ! Ruby ’s not like Tiana . She ca n’t cook everything in New Orleans . ”
27423	27450	27411	27411	Eleanor	107	“ You might just as well have fed her dirt . Do you know how many chemicals … how much sodium is in a hot dog ? ”
27451	27459	27460	27460	Lillie	91	“ Ruby said they were cocktail weenies . ”
27474	27479	27460	27460	Lillie	91	“ She said weenie . ”
27480	27494	27495	27495	Eleanor	107	“ Lillian , stop playing with your food . It ’s bad manners . ”
27504	27519	27497	27497	her	107	“ Perhaps we should sit down and create a menu for lunches each week . ”
27528	27540	27522	27522	his	951	“ It was a delicious lunch , complete with baby carrots — ”
27541	27546	27547	27547	Lillie	91	“ And ranch dressing ! ”
27637	27649	27650	27650	Remi	91	“ I appreciate your feelings about a healthy diet , Eleanor , ”
27653	27676	27650	27650	Remi	91	“ I also appreciate Ruby ’s effort preparing a fun lunch for Lillie , even if it falls outside your nutritional norms . ”
27695	27729	27688	27688	I	0	“ Remington , you ca n’t let her eat that trash . Too much sodium is bad for her heart , juvenile diabetes is at an all - time high , obesity is — ”
27730	27738	27748	27748	I	0	“ We can talk about it later . ”
27863	27875	27852	27852	I	0	“ You ’re old enough to hang your own clothes now . ”
27927	27938	27941	27941	she	91	“ What ’s this ? Where did you get these ? ”
27964	27979	27951	27951	She	91	“ Do n’t tell Gigi . She ’ll never let me get a puppy . ”
28075	28084	28085	28085	I	0	“ Where did you get all of these ? ”
28108	28112	28095	28095	She	91	“ Feel it . ”
28137	28146	28124	28124	She	91	“ Gigi says I ca n’t have them . ”
28167	28175	28176	28176	Her	91	“ You need to mind your Gigi . ”
28185	28225	28181	28181	I	0	“ But I ’ll let you keep them . Do n’t get them in your bed . They might pop , and that would make a huge mess . We ’d probably have to get a whole new bed . ”
28237	28250	28231	28231	her	91	“ I love you , Ruby . You ’re my best friend . ”
28258	28275	28231	28231	her	91	“ I love you , too . Now put these up and get in the bed . ”
28276	28298	28300	28300	my	0	“ Maybe if I get all stars I can get a puppy for Christmas like Darling in Lady and the Tramp . ”
28321	28333	28313	28313	I	0	“ Have you talked to your dad about getting a puppy ? ”
28334	28362	28363	28363	I	0	“ Gigi says puppies are a lot of work . She says they ’re babies that never grow up , and I ’m the baby for now . ”
28380	28412	28363	28363	I	0	“ She kind of has a point . Dogs are a lot of work , and you might be too little to help walk it and teach it to do tricks . ”
28413	28419	28420	28420	Her	968	“ Would you help me ? ”
28446	28470	28471	28471	Her	968	“ This is n’t like the ketchup packets , Lil . You ’re going to have to ask your daddy about this one . ”
28487	28497	28477	28477	I	0	“ Now you ’re a well - rolled dumpling . ”
28512	28536	28507	28507	I	0	“ Tell you what . If your daddy says you can have a puppy , I ’ll for sure help you with it . ”
28582	28585	28587	28587	Lady	971	“ Bella Notte ”
28592	28597	28587	28587	Lady	971	“ Now I lay me ”
28649	28658	28640	28640	I	0	“ Do n’t you have work to do ? ”
28666	28674	28675	28675	He	974	“ I ’m at a stopping point . ”
28685	28705	28675	28675	He	974	“ I like listening to you sing with her . She never sang so much before you came here . ”
28706	28717	28640	28640	I	0	“ The songs are the best part of those movies . ”
28718	28728	28675	28675	He	974	“ Want to have that glass of wine now ? ”
28744	28750	28739	28739	I	0	“ I ’d love it . ”
28769	28778	28779	28779	We	977	“ You picked a good song for tonight . ”
28841	28853	28817	28817	Ruby	92	“ This is really good . Did you minor in art ? ”
28854	28858	28859	28859	She	91	“ Heck no . ”
28871	28883	28859	28859	She	91	“ My dad would never approve of such a useless degree . ”
28884	28890	28817	28817	Ruby	92	“ Art ’s not useless . ”
28891	28922	28923	28923	She	91	“ It ’s not something Kenneth Banks was willing to fund , and I caved just like the pushover he always said I was . Always second - guessing myself … ”
28938	28954	28923	28923	She	91	“ But never mind all that . Earlier today you said something that confused me . ”
28985	28992	28973	28973	I	0	“ How did I confuse you ? ”
28993	29029	29030	29030	Her	91	“ You said your dad criticized you . What in the world could he criticize ? You ’ve done really well . You served in the military , then you were a huge tech success … ”
29068	29080	29061	29061	I	0	“ I was successful because I followed the plan he approved . ”
29081	29091	29092	29092	Her	91	“ You ’re saying there was an alternate plan ? ”
29112	29121	29101	29101	her	91	“ A plan my father called absolutely ludicrous . ”
29140	29148	29130	29132	Not many people	981	“ I wanted to be a singer . ”
29161	29165	29153	29153	her	91	“ Shut up . ”
29166	29171	29172	29172	I	0	“ It ’s true . ”
29202	29207	29187	29187	She	91	“ You can sing ? ”
29208	29227	29228	29228	I	0	“ I was in a band in college … for about a minute . Until Howard found out . ”
29237	29244	29228	29228	I	0	“ Naturally , he was horrified . ”
29245	29254	29255	29255	I	0	“ I take it Howard ’s your dad ? ”
29267	29272	29259	29259	her	91	“ That explains it . ”
29273	29276	29259	29259	her	91	“ What ? ”
29277	29315	29259	29259	her	91	“ Lillie has a great ear for music . She never gets off key , and she keeps the tempo steady , even a capella . That ’s really huge for a four - year - old . ”
29327	29342	29259	29259	her	91	“ I thought all children could sing those songs . They all seem to . ”
29343	29361	29362	29362	Her	91	“ Um , no . Most little kids are all over the place . Lillie ’s special . ”
29367	29371	29362	29362	Her	91	“ Like you . ”
29394	29407	29389	29389	she	91	“ What kind of band were you in ? Rock and roll ? ”
29408	29412	29413	29413	She	91	“ Classic country . ”
29426	29430	29413	29413	She	91	“ No way ! ”
29431	29434	29389	29389	she	91	“ Way . ”
29435	29445	29389	29389	she	91	“ You are a very unexpected man , Remington . ”
29446	29451	29452	29452	I	0	“ Call me Remi . ”
29463	29478	29452	29452	I	0	“ I ’m sure you would n’t know a song on our set list . ”
29479	29490	29491	29491	She	91	“ Ha ! That ’s where you ’d be wrong . ”
29514	29532	29502	29502	I	0	“ My mom is a huge classic country fan . It ’s how I got my name . ”
29542	29552	29502	29502	I	0	“ You ’re named after the Kenny Rogers song ? ”
29553	29571	29502	29502	I	0	“ I am indeed . Ma loves it . She ’s fascinated by the Asian war angle . ”
29572	29579	29580	29580	I	0	“ It ’s kind of depressing . ”
29590	29604	29580	29580	I	0	“ Ruby leaves her crippled husband at home to cat around in town . ”
29605	29617	29618	29618	She	985	“ First , it ’s not clear he was her husband . ”
29636	29648	29618	29618	She	985	“ Second , a woman her age has wants and needs . ”
29649	29663	29664	29664	I	0	“ Still , she leaves him to … take her love to town . ”
29679	29699	29670	29670	she	985	“ We should have dinner with your mom . I ’d like to discuss our shared love of Kenny . ”
29700	29707	29708	29708	She	985	“ Do you love Kenny Rogers ? ”
29729	29739	29740	29740	She	985	“ Everyone considered him the coward of the county … ”
29803	29810	29800	29800	her	985	“ My favorite is The Gambler . ”
29811	29823	29824	29824	I	0	“ He made a life out of reading people ’s faces . ”
29839	29865	29866	29866	She	985	“ I thought it was weird how they made a whole TV series out of that song . It ’s really sad . He dies . ”
29877	29882	29866	29866	She	985	“ He broke even . ”
29934	29937	29927	29927	she	985	“ What ? ”
29938	29974	29975	29975	Her	985	“ You said you do n’t want to be like your father , but when you sing , when you listen to your daughter sing and love it , you ’re already not like him . ”
29983	29996	29975	29975	Her	985	“ You said you ’ll help me be sure I ’m not . ”
29997	30001	30002	30002	She	985	“ I will . ”
30007	30018	30002	30002	She	985	“ If I can keep my vision of you clear . ”
30034	30040	30041	30041	She	985	“ What does that mean ? ”
30049	30059	30043	30043	her	985	“ It means you tend to cloud my vision . ”
30075	30082	30060	30060	I	0	“ How do I do that ? ”
30090	30108	30060	30060	I	0	“ You ’re a good man , Remi , and you ’re so sweet to your daughter . ”
30121	30137	30109	30109	Her	985	“ When you look at me , I find it very hard to be objective . ”
30138	30152	30153	30153	She	985	“ Objectively , I enjoy looking at you , so good to know . ”
30163	30172	30153	30153	She	985	“ Sing me your favorite Kenny Rogers song . ”
30173	30186	30187	30187	I	0	“ Wow … okay … I have to think about that one . ”
30210	30227	30206	30206	I	0	“ She believes in me . I ’ll never know just what she sees in me … ”
30237	30250	30228	30228	I	0	“ Mm … that ’s nice . You have an amazing voice . ”
30507	30521	30499	30499	She	985	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to sexually harass you . ”
30529	30537	30522	30522	Her	985	“ I might be a little drunk . ”
30538	30561	30522	30522	Her	985	“ I think sexual harassment is premised on who has the most power , and you only had one glass of wine . ”
30562	30569	30570	30570	She	985	“ Now you ’re a lawyer ? ”
30595	30604	30586	30586	I	0	“ Hang on … where are you going ? ”
30605	30617	30618	30618	She	985	“ It ’s time to walk away . Or maybe run . ”
30625	30635	30618	30618	She	985	“ I do n’t want you to walk away . ”
30636	30646	30586	30586	I	0	“ You ’re right , I ’d better run . ”
30647	30652	30618	30618	She	985	“ Ruby , wait . ”
30662	30670	30653	30653	I	0	“ Why are you running from me ? ”
30713	30725	30703	30703	her	985	“ I ’ve wanted to kiss you since that first night … ”
30732	30747	30727	30727	she	985	“ But you ’re too tempting , Remington Key . You ’ll ruin everything . ”
30748	30754	30755	30755	I	0	“ What would I ruin ? ”
30783	30790	30791	30791	She	985	“ My plans … my goals . ”
30804	30815	30791	30791	She	985	“ Thank you for the wine . Morning comes early . ”
30894	30906	30907	30907	I	0	“ It ’s official . I ’m my own worst enemy . ”
30924	30941	30907	30907	I	0	“ I feel like we ’ve been here before … Just a week ago , actually . ”
31118	31129	31101	31101	I	0	“ Now I ’m bribing small children with ketchup packets . ”
31130	31142	31154	31154	her	383	“ I ca n’t even begin to guess what that means . ”
31159	31172	31154	31154	her	383	“ Make it fast . Hunter will be here in fifteen minutes . ”
31173	31183	31184	31184	I	0	“ Oh , screw Hunter and his Watergate stories ! ”
31195	31214	31184	31184	I	0	“ I ’ve got a real problem . One that does n’t involve Richard Nixon or the Cubans . ”
31261	31267	31258	31258	she	1012	“ You slept with Remi . ”
31268	31271	31272	31272	I	0	“ Nooo ! ”
31286	31320	31272	31272	I	0	“ But I would have . I sure as hell wanted to . It ’s only a matter of time before I do it , and then I ’ve blown the whole deal . ”
31335	31339	31321	31321	Drew	154	“ What happened ? ”
31340	31345	31272	31272	I	0	“ I kissed him . ”
31346	31349	31355	31355	her	1012	“ Oh . ”
31373	31378	31363	31363	I	0	“ That ’s serious . ”
31379	31385	31387	31387	my	0	“ It is , right ? ”
31399	31419	31391	31391	I	0	“ Kissing is almost worse than sex … It ’s like in Pretty Woman . Never kiss a client . ”
31420	31454	31363	31363	I	0	“ It ’s definitely more intimate . You ’re all up close and personal , breathing each other ’s air , noses touching , sliding your tongues together … sliding your bodies together . ”
31455	31458	31459	31459	She	1012	“ Drew ! ”
31464	31471	31459	31459	She	1012	“ Was it a good kiss ? ”
31472	31477	31478	31478	I	0	“ Oh sweet mother … ”
31486	31505	31478	31478	I	0	“ It was the greatest kiss of all time . I think I ’m in love with him . ”
31506	31522	31459	31459	She	1012	“ You ’ve known him three days . You are not in love with him . ”
31523	31540	31541	31541	I	0	“ Have you ever seen him with his daughter ? It ’s the most adorable thing . ”
31554	31564	31541	31541	I	0	“ I think he might be the perfect man . ”
31565	31571	31572	31572	She	1012	“ No one is perfect . ”

31609	31615	31575	31575	her	1012	“ What does that mean ? ”
31616	31641	31541	31541	I	0	“ It means he ’s a singer . He was an actual lead singer in a country band in college . And his voice … ”
31645	31651	31541	31541	I	0	“ It ’s like butter . ”

31679	31692	31693	31693	I	0	“ So now you ’re thinking it might be an appropriate idealization ? ”

31737	31769	31658	31658	her	1012	“ It ’s something new they ’re starting . Now that all the college kids are coming over from Charleston . Gray told me about it — apparently Billy told him . ”

32210	32242	32164	32164	I	0	“ Everything ’s pretty much Lillie - based . I feed her , change her clothes , help her clean up , do little activities with her , do her laundry … ”

32784	32805	32806	32806	Her	91	“ Some people prefer getting eggs from chickens who run around farms . They ’re called free - range chickens . ”
32812	32834	32806	32806	Her	91	“ Like in Chicken Run ? They all made a big airplane out of their cages and flew to a valley . ”

36623	36627	36628	36628	Her	107	“ Is it ? ”
36640	36658	36628	36628	Her	107	“ Probably not , but we can try one more time just to be sure , right ? ”
36725	36734	36708	36708	I	0	“ I might like kissing you too much . ”
36752	36759	36735	36735	Her	107	“ That goes double for me . ”

37292	37316	37282	37282	her	107	“ It ’s everything we both know . I ca n’t live here and be Lillie ’s nanny if we ’re having sex . ”
37333	37343	37324	37324	I	0	“ You can . It ’ll be our secret . ”
37344	37353	37354	37354	Her	107	“ Things like that never stay a secret . ”
37361	37393	37354	37354	Her	107	“ Someone will find out , and it ’ll most likely be Eleanor . Then she ’ll have a field day making me look like … some kind of geisha girl . ”

37828	37845	37810	37810	I	0	“ It seems weird for him to be paying me while I ’m sleeping with him . ”
37846	37853	37854	37854	She	1091	“ Get your paychecks direct deposited . ”
37904	37912	37913	37913	I	0	“ It ’s not a bad idea . ”
37957	37998	37926	37926	Drew	154	“ I can tell he does n’t want me to move out . I kind of suggested it , but he shut it down right away . Me living with them was part of our original deal , I guess . ”
37999	38009	37926	37926	Drew	154	“ How come ? Does Lillie have night terrors ? ”
38010	38025	38026	38026	I	0	“ No … I do n’t know … Maybe he likes having me close ? ”
38077	38116	38072	38072	I	0	“ He said I would be there if Lillie needed anything in the night . It makes sense , I guess . He sleeps on a whole different floor . But so far she sleeps soundly all night . ”
38208	38235	38236	38236	I	0	“ I do n’t want to stop being Lillie ’s nanny . It ’s not just the money . I really like that little butter bean . ”
38253	38266	38244	38244	she	470	“ You ’ve gotten yourself in a real jam , my friend . ”
38267	38275	38276	38276	I	0	“ Thanks . I appreciate your input . ”
38287	38299	38282	38282	she	91	“ It ’s going to work out . It always does . ”
38318	38341	38342	38342	I	0	“ What do you really want , Ruby Banks ? You ’re a grown woman . Now ’s your time to decide . ”
38348	38369	38342	38342	I	0	“ I want to be able to take care of myself . I want to be confident in my choices . ”
38388	38416	38382	38382	Lillie	91	“ Maybe I do want to be a part of their life , but I want to be independent first . I want to make the choice . ”
38427	38434	38417	38417	Drew	154	“ I think that ’s perfect . ”
38435	38462	38382	38382	Lillie	91	“ Well , stop it . I do n’t like all this mushy stuff . Are n’t we supposed to be shopping for a wedding dress ? ”
38463	38485	38382	38382	Lillie	91	“ Oh ! I found one I really like online . I think they have something like it at Second Acts . ”
38486	38490	38491	38491	Lillie	91	“ Second Acts ? ”
38510	38540	38541	38541	We	1096	“ I know you ’re not making celebrity - nanny money , but why are you looking at used wedding dresses ? That ’s got to be bad luck . ”
38565	38568	38569	38569	Lillie	91	“ Princesses ! ”
38589	38600	38575	38575	she	91	“ Stop acting like your mother all of a sudden , ”
38604	38616	38617	38617	I	0	“ Bitch , you did not just say that to me , ”
38622	38631	38632	38632	She	91	“ Just , no more bad luck juju . ”
38641	38662	38632	38632	She	91	“ The markup on all this wedding crap is outrageous . I honestly ca n’t believe some of these prices . ”
38663	38673	38674	38674	I	0	“ Like that ’s some kind of state secret . ”
38735	38745	38746	38746	Drew	154	“ You need to do something casual with him . ”
38759	38777	38746	38746	Drew	154	“ To take the pressure off and see each other in a more friend - type way . ”
38778	38789	38790	38792	A sales associate	1104	“ I ’m not sure we can get much friendlier . ”
38803	38815	38790	38792	A sales associate	1104	“ Would you like a room ? Let me take these . ”
38828	38848	38849	38849	I	0	“ I mean more as friends , less as roommates who ca n’t keep their hands off each other . ”
38852	38863	38864	38864	She	91	“ Sounds reasonable . What did you have in mind ? ”
38878	38894	38864	38864	She	91	“ Stay out here so you can get the full effect once it ’s on . ”
38922	38941	38947	38947	she	91	“ Gray said karaoke starts Tuesday at the Red Cat . Why do n’t we do that together ? ”
38958	38963	38947	38947	she	91	“ Like old friends . ”
38964	38967	38968	38968	My	0	“ Oh ! ”
38978	38989	38947	38947	she	91	“ You ’re beautiful ! I ’m going to cry . ”
39000	39022	38995	38995	I	0	“ Stop it ! You ’re going to make me cry , and I have two more dresses to try on ! ”
39062	39076	39055	39055	her	91	“ So you ’re still coming to the wedding next month , right ? ”
39096	39112	39077	39077	Drew	154	“ Ruby ! You ’re my maid of honor . You have to be there . ”
39113	39121	39122	39122	I	0	“ It ’s just a weekend thing ? ”
39156	39163	39164	39164	She	490	“ It ’s Thursday to Sunday . ”
39175	39183	39164	39164	She	490	“ Or Saturday night , I guess . ”
39184	39193	39194	39194	We	1110	“ Of course , I ’ll be there . ”
39447	39457	39458	39458	Eleanor	107	“ Remington , I need to speak with you . ”
39493	39521	39522	39522	Her	135	“ We ’re starting our second week with this young woman living in our house , and I ’m just not sure how I feel about it . ”
39622	39649	39599	39604	my mother - in - law	314	“ It ’s my house , Eleanor , and I could n’t be happier with Ruby . Did you see the paintings they did last week ? ”
39682	39719	39677	39677	She	135	“ I did , and did you even ask if she used nontoxic paint ? What if Lillie had put her paintbrush in her mouth ? We already know that idiot teacher lets her eat dirt . ”
39720	39729	39730	39730	I	0	“ I ’m sure Ruby watched her closely . ”
39788	39811	39812	39812	She	91	“ I do n’t think it ’s a good idea for her to live here with the way she looks at you . ”
39819	39839	39814	39814	her	91	“ There , I said it . People are talking , and I think it ’s a bad idea . ”
39840	39852	39854	39854	my	0	“ I could n’t care less about small - town gossip . ”
39865	39888	39889	39889	Her	91	“ I ’d actually hoped you might start looking for your own place . I ’m sure you ’d like more privacy . ”
39903	39952	39894	39894	she	91	“ I have all the privacy I need in my suite downstairs . I need to be near my granddaughter . I ’ve lived here all her life . It ’s all she knows . Anyway , it ’ll help with these silly rumors if I ’m here . ”
39961	40002	39894	39894	she	91	“ I do n’t give a shit about the rumors , and Lillie will adjust to you having your own place . It would give her somewhere to go for sleepovers , and you can spoil her all you want . ”
40003	40026	40027	40027	Her	1133	“ I will not listen to that kind of language , Remington ! This sounds like the influence of that young woman . ”
40042	40067	40034	40034	she	1133	“ Serena North went to school with her , and it seems she ’s rather wild . She ’s dated a lot of men . ”
40093	40105	40087	40087	She	135	“ Last I checked , dating is n’t against the law . ”
40106	40139	40148	40148	she	135	“ How do you know she ’s not after your money ? She definitely has you in her sights . It ’s very obvious from the way she ’s always touching you . ”
40140	40146	40087	40087	She	135	“ I have n’t noticed . ”
40172	40199	40161	40161	She	135	“ You would be wise to keep your head around that girl . Her kind are n’t known for being the most trustworthy type of people . ”
40200	40208	40209	40209	My	0	“ What is that supposed to mean ? ”
40250	40265	40245	40245	Her	135	“ I ’m simply saying , Remi . How well do you know her ? ”
40266	40308	40309	40309	She	91	“ Well enough to trust her with my daughter . Based on our first week , I think she ’s doing a damn good job with Lillie . I have no complaints . So what if she ’s a friendly person ? ”
40319	40324	40325	40325	She	135	“ Friendly , ha ! ”
40332	40357	40325	40325	She	135	“ When Dr. North said how he ’s interested in hiring a nanny if they all look like that , Whitney Flagstaff was appalled . ”
40393	40434	40435	40435	My	0	“ I received an invitation today to a very important business event in Manhattan next week . It ’s an overnight trip , and I have to take a date . I ’m considering asking Ruby to go with me . ”
40445	40457	40435	40435	My	0	“ Remington ! I forbid it . What will people say ? ”
40458	40471	40435	40435	My	0	“ It ’s a business event , and I need an escort . ”
40472	40486	40487	40487	My	0	“ That ’s exactly what they ’ll say . She ’s your escort . ”
40491	40520	40487	40487	My	0	“ In the literal sense . I need you to watch Lillie for me while we ’re gone . Provided Ruby says yes . Will you do it ? ”
40521	40526	40527	40527	She	314	“ I will not . ”
40537	40547	40527	40527	She	314	“ I will not aid you in committing sin . ”
40548	40573	40487	40487	My	0	“ You ’re saying you plan to live in this house and you wo n’t watch your granddaughter while I ’m out of town ? ”
40574	40604	40605	40605	My	0	“ Not if you take that woman . I will not let you shame my daughter ’s memory by carrying on in this manner . What will people say ? ”
40629	40684	40618	40618	I	0	“ Do not ever bring up Sandy like this to me . I have been faithful to her memory a long time , and if I choose to date someone , it ’s not an insult to her past … to our past . She will always have a special place in my heart . ”
40769	40787	40762	40762	Eleanor	107	“ If you take that woman on an overnight trip , I will not stand idly by . ”
40788	40808	40809	40809	I	0	“ You ’ll be moving . I ’ll have my realtor begin the search for your new place today . ”
40838	40870	40818	40818	she	91	“ Remington ! I ca n’t move out . I need to be near my granddaughter . She ’s all I have left . She ’s the only thing I have . ”
40928	40954	40955	40955	She	91	“ You will watch Lillie if Ruby agrees to go with me to the gala , and you wo n’t say a word about it . ”
40970	40974	40961	40961	her	91	“ I will . ”
41058	41063	41064	41064	Lillie	91	“ Dad - day ! ”
41081	41129	41071	41071	I	0	“ My broccoli has furry little middles that look like real broccoli ! But the beets just look like lettuce leaves with red stems . And Ruby showed me how to pull weeds and give them just a little bit of water . Not too much water ! ”
41187	41194	41195	41195	I	0	“ An artist and a gardener ? ”
41205	41215	41195	41195	I	0	“ I feel like I ’m getting a bargain . ”
41224	41239	41216	41216	She	313	“ You ’re paying me way too much , but I ’m worth it . ”
41267	41287	41262	41262	Ruby	135	“ Wash your hands . No , get in the tub . You ’ve got dirt all over you . ”
41299	41308	41288	41288	She	91	“ I ’m kind of a mess myself . ”
41309	41319	41320	41320	Her	91	“ I ’d be happy to help with cleanup . ”
41332	41341	41325	41325	she	91	“ I bet you would , filthy boy . ”
41351	41357	41325	41325	she	91	“ I meant with Lillie . ”
41423	41428	41429	41429	She	91	“ Hey , um … ”
41442	41474	41475	41475	She	91	“ You feel like doing something tomorrow night ? Drew said there ’s this Karaoke thing at the Red Cat . Gray thought it might be fun if we all went … ”
41487	41497	41475	41475	She	91	“ Are you asking me out , Miss Banks ? ”
41503	41527	41498	41498	Her	91	“ No ! It ’s like a friend - type thing . A big group of friends . It ’s not a date . ”
41547	41559	41528	41528	I	0	“ Drew and Gray are n’t friends . They ’re engaged . ”
41574	41593	41562	41562	her	91	“ Yes , but you and I are just friends , so back it up , big boy . ”
41676	41679	41670	41670	she	91	“ Hey ! ”
41684	41689	41680	41680	Her	91	“ Eyes up here . ”
41707	41715	41698	41698	I	0	“ Do I get any time off ? ”
41724	41741	41716	41716	I	0	“ Sure ! I mean , I guess so … as long as Lillie ’s covered . ”
41742	41775	41698	41698	I	0	“ I just wanted to have lunch with Ma . It ’s weird not seeing her every day , and I guess yesterday at church I realized how much I miss her . ”
41832	41850	41829	41829	I	0	“ You can certainly have lunch with your mom . I ’ll ask Eleanor to watch Lillie . ”
41861	41869	41870	41870	She	135	“ No . Do n’t ask Eleanor . ”
41897	41912	41889	41889	Ruby	135	“ What if I took Lillie with me instead ? Ma would love it . ”
41913	41921	41922	41922	Her	135	“ I do n’t see why not . ”
41929	41976	41922	41922	Her	135	“ It would mess up your daddy - daughter lunch , but maybe you could do something different that day ? They opened this new custard shop across from the clinic . It ’s supposed to be really good . I would n’t know , because — ”
41977	41991	41992	41992	She	135	“ You ca n’t have dairy . It sounds great . What day ? ”
41995	42010	41992	41992	She	135	“ I was thinking Wednesday … or any day . Whatever works for you . ”
42011	42026	42027	42027	Her	135	“ Wednesday it is . And tomorrow , you and I have a date . ”
42038	42045	42027	42027	Her	135	“ It ’s not a date . ”
42054	42069	42070	42070	Drew	154	“ Seems you ca n’t do anything without causing a commotion , Ruby Banks . ”
42124	42131	42132	42132	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
42145	42149	42132	42132	I	0	“ What commotion ? ”
42150	42180	42181	42181	She	135	“ All the old church ladies are up in arms because Dr. North is interviewing nannies now . The scuttlebutt is he wants a nanny as hot as you . ”
42192	42210	42181	42181	She	135	“ What the hell is that supposed to mean ? Is n’t Dr. North Serena ’s husband ? ”
42211	42225	42226	42226	My	0	“ Do n’t tell me you care what happens to that bitch Serena . ”

42313	42328	42329	42329	Drew	154	“ I was just telling Ruby about Dr. North desperately seeking a hot nanny . ”
42386	42392	42377	42377	he	2693	“ You knew about this ? ”
42393	42402	42366	42366	his	2693	“ I heard something about it from Eleanor . ”

42472	42492	42500	42500	He	2693	“ You should know what this is like . You were the target of their crap for a while . ”
42493	42499	42500	42500	He	2693	“ Longer than a while . ”
42511	42521	42500	42500	He	2693	“ Now I do n’t really give a shit . ”
42565	42578	42579	42580	The guy	1173	“ I ca n’t believe they actually invested money in this place . ”
42618	42624	42599	42599	He	2693	“ Hips Do n’t Lie . ”
42625	42650	42599	42599	He	2693	“ Hey , I ’m really sorry about all that bullshit with Phillip . I had no idea he ’d do something so stupid . ”
42672	42677	42669	42669	his	2693	“ Is he serious ? ”
42696	42708	42678	42678	I	0	“ Or is he just taking a cheap shot at me ? ”
42726	42747	42796	42796	His	2693	“ He ’d better not be doing it to hurt you . Maybe I should have a talk with him — ”
42756	42795	42751	42751	I	0	“ Do n’t . Serena ’s been making cracks at me all my life . If this is just adult bullying , I can deal with it . The last thing I want is to play their game . ”
42821	42860	42809	42809	Remi	91	“ I do n’t like people being shitty when it comes to you . I wo n’t put up with it from Eleanor , and I sure as hell wo n’t put up with it from Phillip North . ”
42861	42881	42882	42882	His	2693	“ You probably should n’t put your arm around me like that . We ’re just friends , remember ? ”

43249	43260	43261	43261	His	2693	“ I might have told her it was your favorite . ”
43280	43291	43269	43269	he	2693	“ It was never my favorite until I met you . ”
43326	43338	43317	43317	he	2693	“ I Guess That ’s Why They Call it the Blues . ”
43344	43354	43339	43339	Gray	139	“ Biggest Elton John fan I ’ve ever known . ”
43403	43424	43395	43395	I	0	“ We ’d better not . People are already talking about us , and you have to think about Lillie . ”
43425	43433	43434	43434	He	2693	“ I think about Lillie a lot . ”
43455	43465	43451	43451	he	2693	“ I want to think about you , too . ”

43538	43563	43508	43508	she	91	“ What the hell ? You just agreed with me I ca n’t date him because it would be too risky with Lillie involved . ”
43564	43574	43575	43575	She	91	“ Yeah , but I ’m rethinking that position . ”
43609	43619	43620	43620	She	91	“ Lillie ’s getting older , and that voice ! ”

43716	43762	43642	43642	he	1192	“ It ’s not a sign of compatibility . She ’s not even related to him . If anything , it shows what a great guy he is that he takes care of her like he does . I heard he pays all her bills . ”

48975	48982	48963	48963	she	141	“ So what ’s the problem ? ”
48995	49022	48985	48985	her	141	“ He did not respect our traditions . He wanted his home to be completely American . He did not like the grace , the politeness . ”

50600	50624	50593	50593	she	92	“ Actually … it ’s not as easy as you think to build a client list . You know how tiny Oakville is . ”
50628	50662	50625	50625	Henry	209	“ I can relate to that dilemma . As a physician , I was lucky to work with your father and other prominent men in Charleston . It fast - tracked my career . ”

50999	51026	50997	50997	him	209	“ Once I move in , I ’ll send you my number . Since you ’re in Eagleton Manor now , you could just walk over . ”

51484	51498	51480	51480	she	92	“ He needs to keep looking . You threw him back , remember ? ”
51499	51508	51515	51520	the fellow making giraffes and dogs	1297	“ I should never have told you that . ”
51542	51579	51532	51532	I	0	“ I ’ve been meaning to ask you … I have a very important business function next week in New York . It ’s an overnight trip … I ’d like you to come with me . ”
51599	51614	51615	51615	I	0	“ We ’ll be attending a gala for tech developers and investors like me , ”
51618	51638	51615	51615	I	0	“ So you ’ll need a formal dress . I can help you with the expense if you need — ”
51644	51657	51641	51641	her	92	“ I can afford a formal dress . But what about Lillie ? ”
51677	51691	51658	51658	Her	92	“ Eleanor has agreed to take care of her while we ’re gone . ”
51692	51700	51701	51701	She	92	“ I do n’t know about this . ”
51711	51725	51701	51701	She	92	“ I ca n’t date you , Remi . You ’re my boss . ”
51726	51739	51658	51658	Her	92	“ You can think of it as more of a work function . ”

51795	51804	51805	51805	I	0	“ I have to take a plus one . ”
51814	51858	51805	51805	I	0	“ I do n’t have the time or the inclination to find some woman to go with me . Your salary is dependent on my business being successful , so you ’ll go with me . And we ’ll have a nice time . ”
51859	51869	51781	51781	she	1299	“ Will we be staying in the same room ? ”

51919	51929	51913	51913	she	1301	“ How is it different from our current arrangement ? ”
51930	51941	51942	51942	We	1302	“ A floor and a mother - in - law . ”
51949	51955	51942	51942	We	1302	“ And a little girl . ”

52076	52091	52057	52057	she	1301	“ Because I like talking to you … because you ’re funny and smart . ”
52117	52140	52110	52110	Her	1301	“ How is it you do n’t have a date ? You ’re easy to talk to , funny , and smart . ”
52141	52161	52110	52110	Her	1301	“ I do n’t know . I guess I ’ve been too focused on my work , on Lillie . ”
52245	52259	52260	52260	Lillie	91	“ Look , Daddy ! Ruby , he made me a colorful unicorn ! ”
52294	52307	52308	52308	Lillie	91	“ That ’s amazing ! Did he make it just for you ? ”
52335	52346	52324	52324	She	92	“ I ’ll think about it and let you know . ”

53216	53222	53223	53223	Remi	205	“ How would Ruby know ? ”

54057	54084	54051	54051	Ruby	214	“ People ca n’t help things like ears and noses , so it ’s not nice to point out if they ’re big or shaped funny . ”
54085	54112	54051	54051	Ruby	214	“ I like Gus Gus . He saves Cinderella with the key from her wicked stepmother ’s pocket . Even though Lucifer tries to eat him . ”
54128	54144	54119	54119	Ruby	214	“ Henry does look a little like Gus Gus . But he ’s not fat . ”

54219	54224	54175	54176	My daughter	313	“ What is it ? ”
54225	54228	54229	54229	Ruby	214	“ Evolve ? ”
54232	54245	54229	54229	Ruby	214	“ It means to grow and change . To learn from experience . ”

55981	55987	55977	55977	Her	214	“ How can you tell ? ”
55988	56005	56014	56014	she	214	“ I watch and learn . Figuring out what you like has become my favorite pastime . ”
56036	56042	56019	56019	Her	214	“ What are you saying ? ”
56049	56074	56019	56019	Her	214	“ You ’re important to me … I care about what you ’re doing . It matters in a way I did n’t expect . ”
56075	56085	56014	56014	she	214	“ I really need to find my own place . ”
56095	56105	56014	56014	she	214	“ I do n’t want you to move out . ”
56113	56127	56014	56014	she	214	“ Then I would n’t be able to kiss you whenever I want . ”
56128	56137	56145	56145	she	214	“ Not here . Someone might see us . ”
56227	56233	56234	56234	My	0	“ You taste so sweet . ”
56253	56259	56247	56247	she	214	“ You smell so good . ”
56269	56272	56273	56273	she	214	“ Remi , ”
56397	56404	56405	56405	She	214	“ We ca n’t do this . ”
56458	56473	56450	56450	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . I should n’t have done that . Forgive me . ”
56567	56582	56557	56558	someone else	902	“ You do n’t have to apologize . I like it . Too much . ”
56652	56661	56665	56665	she	214	“ I ’d better go to bed now . ”
56681	56693	56694	56694	Drew	154	“ So ? Are you going to New York with Remi ? ”
56782	56785	56786	56786	I	0	“ Shush ! ”
56796	56810	56786	56786	I	0	“ If Ma hears you , she ’ll put me in a convent . ”
56811	56817	56818	56818	Drew	154	“ Too late for that . ”
56824	56833	56818	56818	Drew	154	“ Well ? What did you tell him ? ”
56841	56850	56851	56851	I	0	“ I have n’t told him anything yet . ”
56989	57005	56986	56986	her	1397	“ I take it karaoke night did n’t move you back to the friend zone ? ”
57006	57017	57018	57018	I	0	“ God , no . That was a total backfire . ”
57068	57077	57078	57078	Drew	154	“ Well , I do n’t blame you . ”
57086	57105	57106	57106	She	1397	“ His voice is like chocolate ribbons of pure sex . And with those eyes and that dimple … ”
57120	57133	57110	57110	I	0	“ Are n’t you supposed to be in love with someone else ? ”
57134	57145	57146	57146	She	1397	“ For you ! I ’m appreciating him for you . ”
57149	57174	57146	57146	She	1397	“ I ’m so happy you ’ve finally found someone . I swear , I thought you might end up with Ralph after all . ”
57175	57188	57110	57110	I	0	“ Good god , Andrea ! Do n’t even say those words . ”
57195	57242	57110	57110	I	0	“ Is living with him your only reason for not diving headfirst into this love fest ? Because I ’ll help you find an apartment . Heck , with the money you ’re making , you could buy one of those new condos in Eagleton Manor . ”
57243	57250	57251	57251	My	0	“ Remi would just love that . ”
57262	57267	57259	57259	I	0	“ Remember Henry Pak ? ”
57268	57271	57272	57272	She	1397	“ Oh … ”
57278	57284	57272	57272	She	1397	“ He has those ears . ”
57285	57310	57259	57259	I	0	“ Yeah , well , I saw him at the park again , and he said he just bought a condo in Eagleton Manor . ”
57311	57338	57259	57259	I	0	“ That ’s cool . He seems like he ’d make a great neighbor . If you had an emergency , he ’d be right over . ”
57339	57361	57362	57362	Drew	160	“ Remi pretty much forbade me from speaking to him . He says he does n’t want Lillie around him either . ”
57367	57371	57362	57362	Drew	160	“ What happened ? ”
57372	57393	57394	57395	My bestie	490	“ I went out with him . Twice . Apparently , that ’s enough to make poor Henry a leper . ”
57398	57447	57394	57395	My bestie	490	“ That does it . I ’m going to find you a place of your own . I ca n’t stand you two being apart one more day ! And you ’re going with him to New York . Do n’t make me call and tell him myself . ”
57465	57474	57458	57458	I	0	“ I have to buy a formal dress . ”
57475	57492	57493	57493	I	0	“ You can totally afford a formal dress . I ’ll help you pick it out . ”
57511	57538	57493	57493	I	0	“ It ’s such a great job , but I still do n’t know how I can take money from him and go out with him . ”
57539	57549	57550	57550	Drew	160	“ You take care of his daughter , right ? ”
57557	57575	57550	57550	Drew	160	“ You ’re providing a service anyone else would get paid for . Why should n’t you ? ”
57591	57610	57581	57581	I	0	“ I guess you ’re right . I do n’t know why it makes me feel so icky . ”
57611	57641	57588	57588	her	214	“ If he does n’t have a problem with it , neither should you . Of course , once you ’re married , it ’ll all be common property . ”
57642	57653	57654	57654	She	214	“ And now you ’ve soared off into crazy town . ”
57671	57683	57654	57654	She	214	“ Let ’s just take this one step at a time . ”
58007	58019	58000	58000	I	0	“ You ’re even acting this way in God ’s house ? ”
58078	58080	58076	58088	The only “ Christian ” in the group who enthusiastically shook my hand	1421	“ Christian ”
58521	58525	58526	58526	I	0	“ Knock knock . ”
58535	58544	58526	58526	I	0	“ I hope I ’m not disturbing you . ”
58600	58606	58607	58607	His	205	“ You never disturb me . ”
58631	58638	58623	58623	He	205	“ What ’s on your mind ? ”
58639	58655	58679	58679	he	205	“ Everyone ’s napping , so I figured it ’s a good time to talk . ”
58656	58671	58672	58672	His	205	“ I ’m not sure if I like the sound of that or not . ”
58705	58720	58691	58691	I	0	“ I think I ’m overdue to give you an answer about New York . ”
58721	58726	58727	58727	He	205	“ Ah , yes . ”
58744	58751	58737	58737	his	205	“ Have you made a decision ? ”
58848	58866	58840	58840	Drew	160	“ I ’ve thought about it , and I decided yes . I ’ll go with you . ”
58919	58924	58925	58925	His	1444	“ On one condition . ”
58945	58951	58938	58938	him	1444	“ What might that be ? ”
58952	58975	58925	58925	His	1444	“ I ’m not staying with you in the penthouse suite . I ’ll only go if I have my own room … ”
58976	58979	58980	58980	He	1444	“ Done . ”
58989	59006	58980	58980	He	1444	“ On a separate floor . I can make my own reservation and pay for it — ”
59007	59039	58925	58925	His	1444	“ I already said you ’re not paying for your room . This is a business trip you would n’t be taking if I did n’t need you there with me . ”
59040	59055	59056	59056	My	0	“ I still do n’t think you really need me . You never have . ”
59098	59109	59077	59077	his	1447	“ You have no idea how much you ’re needed . ”
59165	59177	59158	59158	Drew	160	“ Just so you understand , we ’re traveling as friends . ”
59178	59184	59185	59185	He	1447	“ Whatever makes you comfortable . ”
59200	59208	59185	59185	He	1447	“ Thank you for going with me . ”
59280	59290	59291	59291	Lillie	214	“ Who ’s going to make me penny cakes ? ”
59328	59354	59311	59311	Ruby	214	“ It ’s only two days , Lil . I ’ll be back on Thursday , and I ’ll make you penny cakes for lunch . ”
59362	59366	59311	59311	Ruby	214	“ I guess . ”
59367	59373	59374	59374	Ruby	214	“ Hey , I know . ”
59383	59404	59374	59374	Ruby	214	“ Which monster did you meet this week ? Last week was white monster number three , right ? Tres ? ”
59411	59417	59405	59405	Lillie	214	“ Yellow monster number three . ”
59418	59423	59424	59424	Ruby	214	“ That ’s right ! ”
59434	59442	59443	59443	Lilly	214	“ And who is it this week ? ”
59457	59479	59447	59447	Ruby	214	“ Come on , I know we were busy packing and getting ready last night , but tell me his name . ”
59512	59518	59509	59509	she	214	“ Purple monster number four . ”
59519	59522	59523	59523	Ruby	214	“ Purple ? ”
59542	59574	59530	59530	I	0	“ Do you know purple is my favorite color ? I ca n’t wait to hear all about purple monster number four . I wonder what his Spanish name might be . ”
59575	59578	59523	59523	Ruby	214	“ Cuatro . ”
59579	59590	59530	59530	I	0	“ Cuatro … I like that name . Do you ? ”
59603	59609	59595	59595	her	214	“ I miss you now . ”
59619	59643	59610	59610	Ruby	214	“ I miss you too , butter bean . We ’ll do something special when I get back , just you and me . ”
59644	59659	59660	59660	Eleanor	107	“ Good heavens , it ’s not like she ’s joining the Foreign Legion . ”
59672	59687	59660	59660	Eleanor	107	“ Lillian , come with me . We have to go to school now . ”
59735	59746	59747	59747	She	214	“ I never know what she ’s going to do . ”
59765	59775	59747	59747	She	214	“ It ’s only a two - day trip . ”
59839	59869	59870	59870	She	214	“ You realize Eleanor has been taking care of her since she was born . All the way up until you arrived … just two and half weeks ago . ”
59884	59894	59895	59895	She	214	“ I know . I ’m such a goose . ”
59901	59905	59895	59895	She	214	“ I just … ”
59919	59922	59912	59912	she	214	“ What ? ”
59934	59942	59925	59925	her	214	“ Eleanor does n’t listen to her . ”
59943	59950	59925	59925	her	214	“ It seems like she does . ”
59951	59986	59925	59925	her	214	“ No , she ’s just pushy . She waits for Lillie to finish speaking , then she tells her what to do . There ’s a difference . Even little kids know it . ”
60045	60057	60058	60058	She	214	“ I love that you ’re so worried about my daughter . ”
60064	60098	60058	60058	She	214	“ Now , no more crying . Lillie is going to be fine . We ’re going to have a fun trip , and you ’ll see my daughter again in two days . ”
60124	60142	60143	60143	I	0	“ You ’re not going to miss her at all ? Did your sentimental chip get lost ? ”
60164	60200	60201	60201	Her	214	“ I will miss my daughter , even though she did n’t seem too upset about telling me goodbye . At the same time , I know she ’ll be fine while I ’m away . ”
60208	60220	60201	60201	Her	214	“ You ’re hurt she did n’t cry over you leaving ? ”
60221	60242	60201	60201	Her	214	“ If the tables were turned , I suppose I ’d be more upset over you being gone , too . ”
60243	60252	60201	60201	Her	214	“ Are you flirting with me , Remington ? ”
60253	60256	60259	60259	her	214	“ Always . ”
60309	60312	60313	60313	Ruby	214	“ Wow . ”
60333	60339	60319	60319	she	214	“ Do you own this ? ”
60368	60371	60372	60372	I	0	“ No . ”
60390	60417	60418	60418	She	214	“ I charter it for short flights . It ’s not really worth the upkeep to own a jet , with as little as I travel . ”
60454	60465	60466	60466	She	214	“ I ’ve never been on a private jet before . ”
60490	60532	60473	60473	her	214	“ Welcome aboard , Mr. Key , Miss. Banks . We ’ll be taking off momentarily . If you would , please fasten your seatbelts , and I ’ll let you know when it ’s safe to move about the cabin . ”

60571	60578	60562	60562	She	214	“ Mm … that ’s delicious . ”
60666	60678	60652	60652	I	0	“ Why do they always give you champagne on private jets ? ”
60679	60689	60690	60690	Her	214	“ I thought you ’d never been on one . ”
60699	60716	60694	60694	she	214	“ I ’ve seen it in the movies . Is it to celebrate being so rich ? ”
60726	60757	60758	60758	She	214	“ More likely to celebrate not having to stand for hours in the TSA line then be forced to sit in a cramped seat next to a potentially annoying neighbor . ”
60761	60778	60758	60758	She	214	“ I can get onboard with that . What ’s our schedule like in New York ? ”
60779	60804	60694	60694	she	214	“ We arrive in Manhattan after noon then we ’ll take a car to the hotel . The gala is tomorrow night at eight . ”
60805	60815	60758	60758	She	214	“ What do we do between now and then ? ”
60816	60864	60694	60694	she	214	“ I ’m meeting one of my investment advisers tonight for drinks . His name is Stephen Hastings . I ’d really like it if you ’d join me , but you do n’t have to … if you have something else in mind you ’d prefer . ”
60865	60871	60872	60872	She	1479	“ I ’ll join you . ”
60880	60889	60872	60872	She	1479	“ I ’ve never been to New York . ”
60890	60895	60694	60694	she	214	“ You have n’t ? ”
60937	60950	60928	60928	she	1479	“ Then I think we should spend a little time being tourists . ”
60969	60977	60962	60962	I	0	“ You ’ll do that for me ? ”
60978	60995	60955	60955	her	1479	“ I ’d love to do that with you . What do you want to see ? ”
60996	61006	61007	61007	She	1479	“ Oh man , I want to see everything . ”
61020	61059	61007	61007	She	1479	“ The Statue of Liberty , the Empire State building , Central Park , Wall Street , Time ’s Square , Broadway , the Guggenheim museum , the Met , the Brooklyn bridge , Soho , the Village … ”
61065	61089	61060	61060	I	0	“ We ca n’t do all of that , but we can make a plan and see how much we can fit in . ”
61150	61156	61143	61143	she	1479	“ What are you thinking ? ”
61181	61186	61169	61169	She	1479	“ It ’s silly . ”
61194	61198	61187	61187	I	0	“ Tell me . ”
61210	61217	61203	61203	her	1479	“ I ’ll never forget this . ”
61241	61254	61237	61237	I	0	“ I ’m glad I ’m here to share it with you . ”
61320	61331	61310	61310	I	0	“ Come up and see my view of Central Park . ”
61332	61339	61340	61340	Her	214	“ You ’re just showing off . ”
61354	61379	61346	61346	I	0	“ You might recall my original plan was to share this with you . Bring a few things in case you decide to stay . ”
61380	61391	61310	61310	I	0	“ How many times do I have to tell you — ”
61392	61398	61340	61340	Her	214	“ Sorry , bad connection . ”
61399	61405	61346	61346	I	0	“ It ’s a landline . ”
61406	61414	61310	61310	I	0	“ Hurry up , I ’m hungry . ”
61475	61480	61481	61481	She	214	“ This is amazing . ”
61497	61507	61481	61481	She	214	“ It ’s like a whole house up here . ”
61508	61524	61526	61526	her	214	“ It ’s half the top floor . The other half is a separate suite . ”
61532	61540	61529	61529	I	0	“ You did n’t bring a bag . ”
61541	61552	61481	61481	She	214	“ I ’m not staying in your room , Remi . ”
61559	61573	61574	61574	She	214	“ Are you hungry ? I ’ve been craving a cheeseburger all week . ”
61578	61587	61574	61574	She	214	“ A cheeseburger ? What would Eleanor say ? ”
61588	61596	61529	61529	I	0	“ I do n’t give a fuck . ”
61622	61638	61613	61613	I	0	“ We ’re in a pretty touristy part of the city , right in Midtown . ”
61639	61644	61613	61613	I	0	“ Near Rockefeller Center ! ”
61645	61648	61613	61613	I	0	“ Right . ”
61666	61690	61691	61691	She	214	“ We can head down toward the Village and see Soho after we eat . That ’ll take two things off your list . ”
61698	61709	61691	61691	She	214	“ Can we go to Magnolia Bakery and get cupcakes ? ”
61710	61723	61691	61691	She	214	“ We can do as much as we have time to do . ”
61771	61780	61768	61768	her	214	“ I ca n’t eat all of this . ”
61796	61812	61786	61786	I	0	“ Get a go box . We can eat it tonight after we meet Stephen . ”
61813	61830	61831	61831	She	214	“ You ’re not cheating too bad . It says , ‘ fresh local ingredients . ’ ”
61838	61851	61831	61831	She	214	“ I ’m pretty sure there ’s nothing healthy about this lunch . ”
61932	61939	61940	61940	She	214	“ Is that the Brooklyn Bridge ? ”
61950	61953	61940	61940	She	214	“ Williamsburg . ”
61966	61972	61954	61954	I	0	“ Brooklyn is further south . ”
61973	61982	61940	61940	She	214	“ Is this the one from the movie ? ”
61983	61993	61994	61994	She	214	“ That ’s Queensboro . It ’s further north . ”
62001	62008	61998	61998	her	214	“ I ’m all mixed up . ”
62009	62019	62025	62025	I	0	“ It ’s okay . I know the way . ”
62042	62052	62025	62025	I	0	“ I ’m really glad you came with me . ”
62053	62061	62067	62067	she	214	“ I ’m having an amazing time . ”
62084	62103	62073	62073	She	214	“ How do you know so much about New York ? I thought you grew up in Seattle . ”
62104	62120	62073	62073	She	214	“ My mother loved it here . She always wanted to live in the city . ”
62130	62167	62073	62073	She	214	“ My father hated the city . It ’s too noisy , too crowded . You have to have a reservation at every restaurant . If you do get a table , the service is terrible … ”
62168	62177	62181	62181	her	214	“ He sounds like a lot of fun . ”
62187	62203	62181	62181	her	214	“ He was the proverbial dark cloud . I never want to be like him . ”
62223	62274	62216	62216	Ruby	214	“ I told you . You ’re nothing like him . I do n’t know your mom , but it sounds like you ’re much more like her . You like to have fun , and so far , you ’ve shown me all the cool parts of the city . ”
62297	62304	62284	62284	Melancholy	229	“ We ’re only getting started . ”
62361	62372	62373	62373	Ruby	214	“ I feel like I ’m walking on my ankles . ”
62387	62404	62405	62405	She	214	“ We ’ve got to meet Stephen at seven . Take a quick shower and change . ”
62411	62424	62405	62405	She	214	“ Where are we meeting him and do I have to walk ? ”
62425	62454	62455	62455	Her	214	“ It ’s seven blocks to the Top of the Rock . Since you ’re new in town , I thought you ’d like to see the view . ”
62463	62482	62460	62460	me	0	“ Do this and I ’ll order cupcakes from Magnolia Bakery and give you a foot massage after . ”
62483	62486	62455	62455	Her	214	“ Deal ! ”
62841	62844	62817	62817	Remi	205	“ Remington . ”
62862	62871	62850	62850	Stephen	185	“ Stephen , meet Ruby , my assistant . ”
62878	62884	62885	62885	I	0	“ How do you do ? ”
62899	62903	62889	62889	Stephen	185	“ Not bad . ”
62928	62948	62923	62923	he	185	“ I meant to say I ’m not doing bad . You seem to be doing quite well yourself . ”
62949	62957	62958	62958	I	0	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
62977	62996	62974	62975	overgrown jerks	1529	“ Remi has never had an assistant . I would n’t expect him to have one like you . ”
62997	63001	63002	63002	I	0	“ Like me ? ”
63005	63011	63002	63002	I	0	“ Is that a compliment ? ”
63031	63047	63012	63012	Remi	205	“ Stephen likes to think he can figure everyone out in the first five minutes . ”
63048	63054	63055	63055	He	205	“ I ’m not wrong . ”
63061	63069	63070	63070	He	205	“ Whiskey up , vodka , and … ”
63076	63079	63070	63070	He	205	“ Tequila ? ”
63080	63083	63084	63084	I	0	“ Sunrise . ”
63091	63114	63084	63084	I	0	“ You ’re pretty good at guessing drinks . What am I like ? Or do you need a few more minutes ? ”
63125	63130	63117	63117	his	185	“ Stubborn … smart . ”
63142	63156	63131	63131	His	185	“ You ’re very beautiful , and most dangerous of all . Ambitious . ”
63175	63183	63167	63167	Remi	205	“ Okay , that ’s enough flattery . ”
63184	63192	63193	63193	Stephen	185	“ You ’re not really his assistant . ”
63215	63244	63245	63245	Remi	205	“ I see Oakville ’s working out after all . I could n’t figure out why you stayed all those years . Why not move back to Seattle ? ”
63252	63284	63245	63245	Remi	205	“ I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve considered it . Last summer I had one foot out the door … But I found a reason to stay . ”
63308	63319	63303	63303	Stephen	185	“ I suppose we have you to thank for that . ”
63320	63331	63332	63332	Stephen	185	“ Actually , we just met a few weeks ago . ”
63337	63346	63347	63347	He	185	“ Remi has always been the lucky one . ”
63354	63397	63347	63347	He	185	“ Let ’s talk about tomorrow night . Stellan will be there . I suggest you make a point to get to him first . His secure communications app is the talk of the industry . It ’s going to be big . ”
63506	63513	63514	63514	Remi	205	“ What ’s new with you ? ”
63559	63571	63572	63572	He	185	“ I ’m working on something a little closer to home . ”
63586	63623	63572	63572	He	185	“ Two things , actually . The first has more immediate use . An app that tracks prescriptions by patient driver ’s license or tax identification , similar to the way the government tracks gun sales — ”
63624	63630	63631	63631	Remi	205	“ Hopefully not as sloppily , ”
63634	63642	63631	63631	Remi	205	“ Nothing I do is ever sloppy . ”
63648	63681	63631	63631	Remi	205	“ The second is more dependent on current events , politics . It ’s something companies can use to facilitate healthcare enrollments across state lines . Similar to how car insurers work . ”
63682	63687	63714	63714	He	185	“ Both healthcare related . ”
63705	63713	63714	63714	He	185	“ It always goes back to healthcare . ”
63733	63759	63714	63714	He	185	“ It ’s simply the biggest problem we have in this country . It needs a solution , and I ’m prepared to develop some . ”
63760	63768	63714	63714	He	185	“ So you ’re developing them yourself ? ”
63769	63784	63785	63786	No one	2720	“ Oh , I ’ll farm out the coding . Unless I get bored . ”
63825	63836	63816	63816	he	185	“ My apologies for monopolizing the evening , Miss Banks . ”
63837	63861	63862	63862	I	0	“ No way , I found it fascinating . I ’ve been wanting to know more about how Remi makes all his money . ”
63879	63889	63890	63890	Remi	205	“ So I was right . Not an assistant . ”
63908	63934	63935	63935	Stephen	185	“ You know , I thought I was pretty good at figuring people out , too , but I realize I ’m not always right . ”
63940	63954	63935	63935	Stephen	185	“ It ’s a skill mastered by meeting lots and lots of people . ”
63963	63998	63999	63999	He	185	“ Actually , I think I just made an honest mistake . I had you pegged as a conceited asshole the moment I saw you . Now I realize you ’re simply an engineer . ”
64004	64028	63999	63999	He	185	“ You ’re absolutely right , I am . Although I also pretty much hate everyone … Except Remington . And possibly you . ”
64056	64065	64045	64045	Stephen	185	“ Hang onto her . She ’s smart . ”
64082	64087	64066	64066	Remi	205	“ I intend to . ”
64159	64182	64186	64186	his	205	“ I ’ve got ta say , you ’re the first girl I ’ve met to stand up to Stephen like that . ”
64194	64212	64186	64186	his	205	“ I know many who ’ve wanted to say the things you did , but never do . ”
64213	64225	64186	64186	his	205	“ If you ’d met my dad , you ’d understand . ”
64271	64293	64265	64265	he	205	“ I remember you said your dad made you question your choices . You did n’t say he made you strong . ”
64306	64319	64265	64265	he	205	“ I guess I did n’t really realize it until just now . ”
64320	64324	64325	64325	His	205	“ Silver lining ? ”
64330	64338	64325	64325	His	205	“ You ’re not afraid of anything . ”
64339	64345	64346	64346	I	0	“ That ’s not true . ”
64393	64398	64399	64399	He	205	“ What scares you ? ”
64449	64468	64446	64446	my	0	“ Earlier , when Stephen asked you if you ’d ever move back to Seattle … Would you ? ”
64562	64570	64550	64550	He	205	“ Would you ever consider leaving Oakville ? ”
64581	64608	64578	64578	I	0	“ When I was young , all I wanted was to leave Oakville . I thought it was a hick town with small - minded people . ”
64648	64657	64631	64631	he	205	“ I think I hear a but coming . ”
64658	64667	64668	64668	I	0	“ Everyone I know has a big butt , ”
64674	64677	64671	64671	He	205	“ Well ? ”
64695	64718	64678	64678	I	0	“ Now I realize how much I love my friends and being near my mom , even though she drives me crazy . ”
64729	64742	64726	64726	I	0	“ It made me sad to hear you ’d thought of leaving . ”
64768	64782	64746	64746	he	205	“ I have n’t thought of leaving once in the last eighteen days . ”
64807	64814	64790	64790	My	0	“ Has it been eighteen days ? ”
64815	64821	64790	64790	My	0	“ Tomorrow will be nineteen . ”

64858	64871	64853	64853	His	205	“ I think it ’s a very good thing . Do you ? ”
64882	64889	64876	64876	I	0	“ I think it ’s amazing . ”
64986	65000	64969	64969	his	205	“ I want to make love to you now . Is that okay ? ”
65016	65021	65008	65008	I	0	“ Yes , please . ”
65103	65115	65097	65097	his	205	“ I ’ve dreamed of this every night since you came . ”
65149	65153	65154	65154	my	0	“ Oh yes , ”
65195	65201	65202	65202	he	205	“ You ’re so wet , ”

70756	70789	70749	70749	Remi	205	“ Stephen said he ’s waiting at the east bar . If you do n’t mind , I ’ll take you to him while I track down Stellan and secure his business . ”
70790	70804	70811	70811	Remi	205	“ Why is Stephen here ? Is he an investor or a developer ? ”
70805	70810	70811	70811	Remi	205	“ Neither and both . ”
70849	70855	70856	70856	I	0	“ So Stephen is both ? ”
70870	70918	70864	70866	Mr. Old Guy	235	“ Stephen likes to be the idea guy , start with his own inspiration then decide whether he wants to create it all himself or hire someone else to do the work . Then he and I and a small group of investors fund the final product . ”
70919	70925	70856	70856	I	0	“ He sounds really smart . ”
70926	70964	70966	70966	my	0	“ He ’s the smartest guy I know — and trust me , he ’s the first to say it . Stephen ’s got a big brain , a big ego , and a big bank account . ”
70975	70987	70972	70972	I	0	“ I take it he does n’t play well with others . ”
70996	71002	70990	70990	I	0	“ Not in the slightest . ”
71097	71123	71087	71087	he	235	“ Stellan ’s just across the room by the bar . If you go now , I think you ’ll have him all to yourself . ”
71158	71191	71153	71153	he	235	“ I do n’t expect this to take very long . Will you be okay hanging with this asshole for a few minutes ? I promise to make it up to you . ”
71207	71212	71199	71199	I	0	“ Break a leg . ”
71229	71236	71237	71237	He	235	“ Thank you for being here . ”
71268	71275	71262	71262	he	235	“ Keep an eye on her . ”
71276	71286	71262	71262	he	235	“ She ’ll be safe as the crown jewels . ”
71306	71320	71294	71294	I	0	“ I see you ’ve graduated from assistant to … something more fun . ”
71339	71346	71327	71327	I	0	“ I was never his assistant . ”
71347	71353	71354	71354	Stephen	185	“ You do n’t say . ”
71379	71386	71368	71368	he	185	“ So you slept with him . ”
71402	71414	71387	71387	He	185	“ You do n’t beat around the bush , do you ? ”
71415	71421	71422	71422	He	185	“ What ’s the point ? ”
71442	71457	71436	71436	I	0	“ We ’re all adults here . Do n’t act like you ’re shocked . ”
71458	71464	71465	71465	I	0	“ I ’m not shocked . ”
71470	71486	71465	71465	I	0	“ I guess I ’m used to people being a little subtler with their digs . ”
71487	71494	71495	71495	He	185	“ It was n’t a dig . ”
71502	71526	71495	71495	He	185	“ I appreciate you bringing him out of retirement . Remi was too young to lay down and die like he almost did . ”
71527	71537	71538	71538	My	0	“ I really do n’t know what you mean . ”
71562	71580	71557	71557	Remi	205	“ We ’ve only known each other about a month . Less than a month , actually . ”
71581	71593	71594	71594	Inwardly	236	“ So how ’d you meet ? Are you in tech ? ”
71612	71621	71599	71599	I	0	“ He hired me to be the nanny . ”
71626	71633	71599	71599	I	0	“ To be Lillie ’s nanny . ”
71643	71653	71639	71639	he	185	“ Classic . Remington ’s sleeping with the nanny . ”
71675	71708	71656	71656	he	185	“ I only took the job to help him out . He was having some sort of conflict with his mother - in - law . It was very frustrating to him . ”
71709	71712	71713	71713	Stephen	185	“ Eleanor . ”
71720	71724	71713	71713	Stephen	185	“ Dragon lady . ”
71747	71783	71739	71739	He	185	“ Oh , please . Everyone ’s so ready to get their panties in a knot these days . Eleanor ’s not even Asian , but you know what I mean when I say it . ”
71791	71799	71788	71788	he	185	“ She can be a bit much . ”
71806	71830	71831	71831	He	185	“ I ’m going to have to resign . I do n’t see how we can go back to having a platonic relationship . ”
71841	71879	71831	71831	He	185	“ In my experience , there ’s no putting that genie back in the bottle . What will you do if you ’re not Lillie ’s nanny ? Do you have another position waiting in the wings ? ”
71889	71915	71884	71884	I	0	“ I have a master ’s in social work . Before I started with Remi , I was a therapist at the clinic in town . ”
71916	71926	71831	71831	He	185	“ So you ’ll go back to shrinking heads ? ”
71927	71961	71884	71884	I	0	“ That ’s not technically what I did . It ’s not really what I want to do again . The idea was I ’d figure it out while I worked for him . ”
71962	71966	71967	71967	I	0	“ Did you ? ”
71975	71982	71967	71967	I	0	“ I got a little distracted . ”
72047	72066	72067	72067	Stephen	185	“ Good luck with whatever you decide , Miss Banks . I hope it works out for you . ”

72102	72108	72092	72092	He	185	“ How ’d it go ? ”
72109	72114	72115	72115	He	185	“ I got him . ”

72192	72198	72199	72199	He	205	“ She Believes in Me . ”
72257	72269	72253	72253	he	205	“ That song is the musical equivalent of a Lifetime movie . ”
72270	72280	72281	72281	He	205	“ It ’s Ruby ’s favorite Kenny Rogers song . ”
72318	72326	72327	72327	Stephen	185	“ Time to call it a night . ”
72341	72351	72327	72327	Stephen	185	“ I remember when you could hold your liquor . ”
72352	72359	72360	72360	Remi	205	“ I ’m holding my liquor . ”
72374	72399	72360	72360	Remi	205	“ You ’re right , though . We have an early flight tomorrow . Time to head back to the hotel and get busy . ”

72525	72541	72518	72518	Remi	205	“ You ’re sleeping over at my place again . Do n’t argue with me . ”
72553	72584	72542	72542	He	205	“ Okay , but do n’t get used to it . Starting tomorrow , it ’s back to business . You ’re my boss . I ’m Lillie ’s nanny . ”
72585	72600	72601	72601	He	205	“ You know , banging the hot nanny is a very popular male fantasy . ”
72622	72633	72609	72609	His	205	“ Are you saying that ’s why you hired me ? ”
72634	72638	72609	72609	His	205	“ Not exactly . ”
72719	72725	72728	72728	he	205	“ Not exactly means partly . ”
72733	72747	72728	72728	he	205	“ I was attracted to you the first time I ever saw you . ”
72748	72755	72787	72787	his	205	“ That night in the bar ? ”
72756	72784	72785	72785	He	205	“ That day on the church lawn when Drew introduced us . Lillie was squirming all over me , and you took one look and walked away . ”
72805	72814	72787	72787	his	205	“ I told you that was n’t me . ”
72833	72838	72839	72839	He	205	“ It was you . ”
72853	72881	72839	72839	He	205	“ Oakville is n’t big enough for two insanely sexy , smart , stubborn , irresistible , half - Korean beauties like you . Why deny it ? ”
72882	72894	72895	72895	My	0	“ I was in a really bad head space back then . ”
72913	72943	72901	72901	he	205	“ I was using these silly dating apps , and they kept matching me with losers . I was pretty miserable . Way too far up my own butt . ”

73006	73023	72979	72979	His	205	“ Trust me , the dates did n’t last very long . I usually sneaked out . ”
73024	73027	73031	73031	he	205	“ Good . ”
73036	73056	73031	73031	he	205	“ So to answer your question , attraction might have had a little to do with your job offer . ”
73100	73117	73135	73135	His	205	“ Do n’t think for one minute attraction had nothing to do with me saying yes . ”
73258	73267	73245	73245	Eleanor	107	“ I trust you had a successful trip ? ”
73268	73287	73245	73245	Eleanor	107	“ More than successful . I landed the developer I was after and got leads on two more . ”
73294	73308	73245	73245	Eleanor	107	“ Thank you for keeping an eye on Lillie while I was away . ”
73309	73315	73316	73316	She	107	“ She ’s my granddaughter . ”

73448	73475	73412	73412	Ruby	214	“ I marched over there , and in my most serious voice , I told him , ‘ You ’d better watch it , Mister . ’ ”
73476	73481	73482	73482	Ruby	214	“ Then what happened ? ”
73504	73518	73491	73491	I	0	“ Bunny came with me and we played Mulan the rest of recess . ”

77188	77227	77182	77182	He	205	“ You said the sheets were probably ruined . I ’m afraid you might be right . I treated them with this last night , but I ca n’t tell if it ’s making much of a difference . ”

77755	77779	77737	77737	Her	206	“ I accompanied Remi on a business trip , not that it ’s any of your concern . He needed a plus one . ”

77812	77825	77795	77795	her	181	“ Seems not too long ago they simply called it an escort . ”
77826	77844	77845	77845	Serena	206	“ I suppose it ’s the same deal . He pays her . She provides the service . ”
77863	77882	77853	77853	she	206	“ If Phillip thinks he ’s hiring a nanny like that , he ’s got another thing coming . ”

78247	78268	78240	78240	Drew	160	“ Ruby ! Are you okay ? It sounds like you ’re crying . What happened ? Talk to me . ”

78612	78644	78594	78594	she	184	“ I included a little extra to cover our trip to New York . I know you had to buy a dress and shoes … I ’m sure there were expenses . ”
78645	78651	78656	78656	her	184	“ You added … cash . ”

78720	78743	78714	78714	She	184	“ If anything , I would ’ve expected you to pay me less for this week , considering we spent three days … ”
78749	78760	78744	78744	Her	184	“ Doing what ? What were we doing , Remi ? ”

79255	79289	79245	79245	She	184	“ I was . Until people like Eleanor started calling me a whore . Until Serena North basically called me a high - class hooker in front of everybody at the preschool today . ”

79568	79635	79559	79559	She	184	“ I do n’t care as much about me or my reputation . I care about my mom and how hard she works taking care of the seniors at church . I care about Lillie and the kids at preschool repeating what their parents say to her , or talking behind her back . She might not understand it now , but one day she will . ”
79646	79658	79636	79636	Ruby	214	“ I care about you and what people say about you . ”

80626	80676	80609	80609	She	214	“ They make these things called stress balls . You squeeze them when you feel stressed out , and it ’s supposed to make you feel better . It might be a great alternative to those packets . What do you think ? Want me to get you one ? ”
80683	80688	80677	80677	She	214	“ What ’s stress ? ”
80689	80720	80609	80609	She	214	“ It ’s bad feelings you get when you ca n’t control things . Or maybe too many things are happening at the same time , and you feel overwhelmed . ”
80728	80737	80722	80722	she	214	“ I do n’t like to feel stress . ”
80738	80758	80759	80759	I	0	“ Nobody does . It ’s like those dolls with the beady eyes . They always stress me out . ”

81073	81100	81101	81101	He	1773	“ I think the reason she likes to play with ketchup packets is the same reason you like squeezing a stress ball . It ’s soothing . ”

81311	81339	81302	81302	She	1777	“ I do n’t want her involved . I do n’t like how she treated you . I do n’t like how she treated either of us . ”

81634	81650	81626	81626	she	214	“ You did the work as Lillie ’s nanny . You deserve to be paid . ”
81665	81678	81656	81656	she	214	“ I ’ll be here Monday morning to take her to preschool . ”
81679	81704	81705	81705	She	214	“ I can take her in the mornings . What if you pick her up and stay with her during the afternoons until dinner ? ”
81740	81757	81731	81731	I	0	“ I ’m doing half the work . You should adjust my pay to reflect that . ”

81821	81841	81842	81842	Lillie	214	“ She felt like it would be better for all of us if she did n’t live here anymore . ”
81853	81877	81844	81844	her	214	“ I do n’t think it ’s better for me if she ’s not here anymore . Do you think it ’s better ? ”

82253	82265	82197	82197	He	1797	“ It ’s not about Stellan . It ’s … personal . ”
82266	82273	82197	82197	He	1797	“ I do n’t do personal . ”
82274	82295	82226	82226	his	1797	“ You ’ll do it for me . I ’m pissed and I ’m tired and I feel fucking powerless . ”
82296	82320	82321	82321	He	1797	“ You are never powerless . If something appears out of your control , you need to step back and reframe the situation . ”
82328	82341	82321	82321	He	1797	“ Unless it ’s a woman . Then you ’re probably powerless . ”
82342	82347	82348	82348	He	1797	“ Ruby left me . ”

82712	82758	82694	82694	she	1801	“ If you want her to stay , tell her . If you care about her , ask her on a date , propose to her . Marry the girl . Whatever is in your heart . Just stop making it harder than it is . ”

83181	83226	83175	83175	I	0	“ I ca n’t go back to the clinic . I feel like such a failure . I was supposed to be getting financially independent . I was supposed to be finding out who I am . Instead I fell in love with him . ”

83241	83259	83260	83260	She	1810	“ To be fair , you were kind of already into him when you took the job . ”

83292	83304	83260	83260	She	1810	“ It ’s why you ’re a better therapist than me . ”
83305	83319	83320	83320	Her	1810	“ I thought you said being a good therapist made me a doormat . ”
83333	83366	83320	83320	Her	1810	“ I was so wrong to say that . I take it back . You ’re the best friend a person could ever have . I ’m so lucky to have you . ”
83388	83403	83404	83404	She	1810	“ Okay , we ’re getting out of the house now . Come on . ”
83418	83428	83404	83404	She	1810	“ I ca n’t go out looking like this . ”

83460	83487	83448	83448	her	1810	“ I have beer in the fridge if you want one . I bought all the alcohol so I could get good and drunk last night . ”

83985	84018	83974	83974	Drew	154	“ You just needed to get out of that bed and start moving around . You already know who you are and what you want . It ’s just about doing it . ”
84049	84061	84062	84062	Drew	154	“ I ’ll see about getting registered for those courses tonight . ”

84698	84713	84714	84714	He	1838	“ I was just thinking about yesterday and Friday and how everything went down . ”
84719	84746	84716	84716	his	1838	“ So much shit was happening from the gala to the ketchup scare to the moving out business . I think we had a massive miscommunication . ”
84806	84810	84811	84811	I	0	“ A miscommunication ? ”
84816	84858	84811	84811	I	0	“ I ’m sorry for not realizing how that extra money made you feel . In no way did I think of it as any sort of payment for your time … I just wanted to do something nice for you . ”
84886	84890	84882	84882	him	1838	“ Apology accepted . ”
84904	84907	84908	84908	He	1838	“ Ruby … ”

85007	85026	84973	84973	His	1838	“ First , do n’t shout at me … Second , why do you think I moved out ? ”
85027	85033	85034	85034	His	1838	“ I did n’t shout . ”
85046	85075	85040	85040	he	1838	“ I thought you moved out so we could date without people making rude insinuations — because you care what these assholes think , and I do n’t . ”
85078	85104	85105	85105	He	1838	“ I moved out because too many lines were getting crossed . Things were getting muddled , and you have a little girl to consider . ”
85124	85141	85105	85105	He	1838	“ So you ’re saying you wo n’t date me while you ’re Lillie ’s nanny ? ”

85223	85254	85255	85255	His	1838	“ When I started you said you needed to focus on your work . Maybe we both need to take a step back and think about what we really want . ”
85266	85297	85260	85260	he	1838	“ I have to go . I was just out jogging , and I needed to say these things . I wanted to be sure you know how I feel . ”

85690	85734	85765	85765	Dotty	165	“ Yes ! You could see it every day after school . We can go to my house and play with it , and maybe , if your daddy says it ’s okay , we can take it to your house sometimes too . ”
85735	85738	85739	85739	She	214	“ Okay ! ”
85746	85753	85739	85739	She	214	“ Let ’s get a puppy ! ”
