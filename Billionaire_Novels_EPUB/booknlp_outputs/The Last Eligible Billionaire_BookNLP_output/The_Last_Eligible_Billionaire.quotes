6706	6876	6692	6692	she	111	“ There was no way I could continue being a Dixon , and I never really felt like Bidelspach fit me the way I wanted it to , so I decided to be Begonia Fairchild . My dad would ’ve liked it . He was way more the peace , love , and prosper type than my mom ever was . Give me fifteen minutes to shower and put some clothes on , and I ’ll pull up that rental agreement for you and we ’ll figure out what ’s going on here . Did you want some cheesecake ? I got enough for a party and I figured it would last me all week , but I can go get more if we eat it all this morning . Oh my god . You ’re Jonas Rutherford ’s strange older brother . I ca n’t believe I ’m standing here in your house . And I did n’t mean strange in a bad way . That ’s just — ”
6877	6881	6972	6973	an ass	544	“ Stop talking . ”
6882	6909	6692	6692	she	111	“ — what the teen magazines always called you . I ’m sorry . That ’s a bad habit . I wo n’t say that again . ”
6910	6961	6972	6973	an ass	544	“ You ’ll shower , pack , sign a non - disclosure agreement stating that you were n’t here and you ’ve never seen me , and that you acknowledge I ’ll sue for ten million dollars in the event you break your word , and then you can leave . ”
7067	7074	7075	7075	Begonia	111	“ It ’s okay , Marshmallow , ”
7085	7149	7079	7079	She	111	“ I truly am sorry . That ’s rude of the tabloids to call you names , and I should know better than to repeat it . I ’m a little flustered . It ’s not every day that I — well , that I meet someone related to my teenage crush . But you probably hear that enough that it ’s annoying . ”
7214	7307	7308	7308	She	551	“ Right ! Shower , dressed , and I ’ll make you some coffee and cheesecake while I sign that non - disclosure agreement for you and we figure out who ’s staying and who ’s going where . My lips are zipped . I wo n’t breathe a word . I wo n’t even ask for a picture . Cross my heart . And I ’m sorry Marshmallow took your phone . He — well , he sometimes thinks he ’s someone ’s annoying little human brother instead of a dog . ”
7311	7347	7348	7348	I	0	“ Do you eat cheesecake ? I know there are cheesecake pop stands on every corner at the Razzle Dazzle parks , but I guess that does n’t mean you eat it , does it ? ”
7354	7361	7348	7348	I	0	“ Right . Upstairs . Right . ”
7372	7415	7369	7369	her	551	“ Why are you here dressed like you came from a party ? I ’ve been here for two nights already , and the host on the vacation rental site must know you well enough to have not expected you , so — ”
7416	7437	7438	7438	She	551	“ While you ’re showering , I ’ll note all damages to the house and prepare a bill for you . ”
7445	7596	7441	7441	I	0	“ You should know that the handheld spout in the owners ’ suite shower was already broken when I got here . I made a note to report it to the host when I have cell service again , and I hardly minded , because the rain shower spout is the coolest thing ever . Who needs the handheld spout when you can pretend you ’re showering in a rainstorm instead ? Also , Marshmallow is n’t the first dog to stay here . I know most owners are picky about dogs staying in vacation rental homes , so it was amazing that this one said pets were welcome . We were a little surprised by the dog hair caked in all the runners on the stairs , but it was n’t a big deal to us since we knew Marshmallow would be leaving some of his own . And — ”
7597	7602	7603	7603	Her	552	“ Stop . Talking . ”
7629	7632	7633	7633	I	0	“ March , ”

7686	7735	7677	7677	she	552	“ Who rents a house like this for fifty bucks a night ? It ’s like that time we signed up to go sailing with that Groupon and got there and the captain was drunk and forgot he booked three hundred people on a boat built for seven . ”
7756	7789	7677	7677	she	552	“ But that turned out okay , did n’t it , Marshmallow ? I really was n’t supposed to be on that boat that day . This will turn out okay too . ”
8903	8906	8907	8907	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
8910	8917	8907	8907	I	0	“ It ’s been seventeen minutes , ”

9304	9314	9315	9315	Hayes	104	“ Dammit , dog , I put you outside , ”
9381	9387	9388	9388	I	0	“ He can open doors , ”
9391	9410	9388	9388	I	0	“ Do you mind waiting downstairs ? And possibly tossing in a couple towels on your way out ? ”
9414	9417	9418	9418	I	0	“ Hayes ? ”
9425	9431	9418	9418	I	0	“ Um , Mr. Rutherford ? ”
9463	9476	9477	9477	I	0	“ I ’m naked and walking to the closet for a towel , ”
9537	9541	9556	9556	I	0	“ Good god , ”
9704	9726	9727	9727	I	0	“ Could you please , for the love of all that has ever been holy , put on some goddamn clothes ? ”
9859	9940	9855	9855	my	0	“ Relax , Mr. Rutherford . One , you ’ve basically already seen it all . Two , I tried to warn you . And three , it ’s not like your mother ’s catching us in a compromising position . I ’m positive this is n’t the worst thing to ever happen to you . It ’s pretty high up there for me though , so if you do n’t mind waiting downstairs for just a couple more minutes — ”
9941	9951	9952	9952	He	332	“ Will you be wearing your own damn clothes ? ”
10030	10058	10021	10021	he	332	“ So long as Marshmallow did n’t distribute them all over the house , yes , I ’ll be drying off and putting on my own clothes . ”
10059	10068	10107	10107	He	332	“ Your dog needs to go back outside . ”
10069	10106	10107	10107	He	332	“ He gets lonely if he ’s outside alone for too long . Also , since he can open doors , if you did n’t lock them all , he ’ll find a way back in . ”
10688	10751	10682	10682	I	0	“ He was raised from birth to be a service dog , but he flunked out of the program when he started doing all the things he ’d learned because he wanted to , instead of only on command . I have things Marshmallow - proofed at home . We have a good system . He ’s out of his element here . ”
10752	10759	10760	10760	I	0	“ Your dog called my mother . ”
10978	10996	10997	10997	she	392	“ Well , I hope Marshmallow was polite and did n’t bark your mother ’s ear off , ”
11060	11070	11054	11058	some kind of dog god	654	“ Good boy , helping Mommy with the dishes . ”
11071	11078	11079	11079	I	0	“ The contract , Ms. Fairchild . ”
11158	11190	11191	11191	She	127	“ Of course . Sorry . Nervous habit . Not that I like cleaning , but I — never mind . The contract . It ’s right here in my email … ”
11220	11226	11214	11214	She	127	“ Is there a problem ? ”
11227	11273	11277	11277	her	127	“ No , no . It ’s just thinking . I like your pajama pants . One of my students found that old video of the dancing hamsters late last year , so we did a unit on the art of the early internet memes . ”
11285	11306	11279	11279	She	127	“ The dancing hamsters on your pants . I assume you ’re a fan ? Or were those a gift ? ”
11307	11317	11279	11279	She	127	“ Hamsters have nothing to do with your contract . ”
11318	11397	11279	11279	She	127	“ I have the contract . I do . But my email program seems to have had a little glitch and emptied all the emails that were in my inbox , and I do n’t get service here , and there ’s no wifi , and … and that was supposed to be exactly what I wanted , but it ’s a little inconvenient right now that I need to download my inbox again and I … can’t . ”
11398	11401	11402	11402	I	0	“ Inconvenient , ”
11413	11664	11405	11405	She	127	“ I paid for this house ! And Mr. Ferguson sent me instructions on how to get to the island and which golf cart company to use to get to the gate with my luggage , and to play a game where I said I was Marilyn Monroe , which makes so much more sense now , for the record , and he sent the code , and I would n’t know any of that if I was n’t authorized somehow to be here , even by someone who should n’t have authorized me . I ’m not a thief . I ’m not a trespasser . Do you believe in fate , Hayes ? Because I saw this house come up on the vacation rental site — one minute it was n’t there , and I got lost in my search and started it over , and then poof , here was this house , and it was fate ’s way of saying I ’m sorry you married the wrong person and took too many years to realize it , here , go enjoy coastal Maine for a couple weeks , and gah , that sounds like I ’m trying to sob - story you into letting me stay , but I ’m not . I ’m just telling you what happened , and you do n’t need to feel sorry for me . I just want you to know I honestly thought I was supposed to be here . ”
11716	11722	11723	11723	She	658	“ Give me your phone . ”
11733	11748	11723	11723	She	658	“ Are you going to make my dog eat it like he did yours ? ”
11763	11771	11772	11772	Her	658	“ Yes . That will solve everything . ”
11779	11787	11772	11772	Her	658	“ I ’m trying very hard here . ”
11788	11846	11772	11772	Her	658	“ And I have a headache , I have n’t slept in two days , and I wanted peace and quiet and to be alone , and this is my house . Give me your damn phone so I can find this damn contract you claim to have so that I know who I have to murder . ”
11847	11857	11912	11912	she	658	“ I do n’t have signal , and I — ”
11858	11869	11870	11870	She	658	“ Give . Me . Your . Damn . Phone . ”
11972	11991	11953	11953	she	658	“ Does your family know you say damn ? That ’s not allowed in any of your movies . ”
11992	11996	11997	11997	I	0	“ Unlock it , ”
12020	12055	12001	12001	She	658	“ If I find out you ’re Hayes Rutherford ’s doppelgänger and that you are really the one who ’s not supposed to be here , I ’ll do something we ’ll both regret . ”
12056	12076	12082	12082	she	658	“ Believe me , Ms. Fairchild , if I could be anyone else right now , I would be . ”
12090	12129	12130	12130	She	658	“ Why would you want to be anyone else ? You ’re financially set , you have a good reputation , your family is lovely , and there ’s literally nothing in the world you ca n’t have . ”
12135	12204	12130	12130	She	658	“ Yes , yes , except this house to yourself at this exact moment . And no family is ever as perfect as they look on TV . I ’m aware . You ’re inconvenienced and imperfect . So am I , Hayes . So am I. But I ’m rolling with it , and I think you ’d be happier if you tried to do the same . ”
12258	12267	12268	12268	I	0	“ How many people did you have over ? ”
12275	12281	12271	12271	Her	658	“ Just me and Marshmallow . ”
12293	12298	12299	12299	She	658	“ Oh , that . ”
12307	12441	12299	12299	She	658	“ It ’s been such a long time since I decided where we should eat that I do n’t actually know my favorite foods anymore . I ’m sampling them all . Do you know I ’d never had curry before yesterday ? There ’s a soup and sandwich shop over in town with a curried chicken salad and it was so good . I ’m thinking of offering to do some bussing in exchange for tips and tricks on how to make my chicken salad that good when I go home . I ’d never ask for their actual recipe , but if they wanted to share the brand of curry powder they use , or any you should know to never combine these ingredients suggestions , that ’s all I need . ”
12514	12520	12521	12521	I	0	“ You need psychological help , ”
12525	12605	12521	12521	I	0	“ My therapist said I probably only need to check in every three to six months . She was massively helpful during the divorce . And I still have daily work to do on myself , but I ’m up for the hard work , and that ’s the important part . Well , that and all the hard work I ’ve already done . Scoot over , please , and I ’ll get these bread crumbs behind you . ”
12656	12677	12678	12678	She	658	“ Could you please make that dog go live outside until I ’ve removed you from this house as well ? ”
12692	12709	12678	12678	She	658	“ Marshmallow ! Go catch a butterfly ! Go catch a butterfly , you good boy ! ”
12773	12779	12762	12762	She	127	“ Coffee while we wait ? ”
12780	12783	12762	12762	She	127	“ No . ”
12784	12812	12813	12813	she	127	“ No , thank you , Begonia , but it ’s a very kind offer to share your special coffee of the month club coffee with me , ”
12846	12936	12813	12813	she	127	“ Does your family drink the same coffee that ’s served at your theme parks , or do you have , like , a private coffee plantation where you grow and harvest your own ? With — what is it ? Civets , right ? Civets eat the raw coffee beans , then digest them , and when they ’re harvested on the other end , they ’re super fancy and delicious in a way you would n’t think considering what the beans have , erm , been through . ”
12937	12955	12956	12956	She	127	“ I do n’t drink coffee . I drink the blood of people who piss me off . ”
12959	13063	12956	12956	She	127	“ Oh , wow , do you have any idea how many of my students quoted that line to me last fall ? I did n’t see Trick or Date — my ex really did n’t like Razzle Dazzle films — but my kids adored it . They even said Jonas was hot for an old guy . Teenagers , right ? Thirty - something is not old , but maybe he should start playing roles more mature than college kids ? I mean , it was great that your family finally moved him up from playing the high - schooler , but — ”
13081	13099	13074	13074	she	392	“ I ’m printing the non - disclosure agreement , and then you can leave . Immediately . ”
13400	13409	13410	13410	Begonia	127	“ Does your eye always twitch like that ? ”
13443	13476	13422	13422	she	127	“ You seem like you ’re under an unhealthy level of stress . Way more than I ’d expect for you finding an unexpected guest in your house . Is everything okay ? ”
13530	13533	13534	13534	He	692	“ Marshmallow ! ”
13567	13572	13557	13557	I	0	“ What the fuck ? ”
13609	13618	13619	13619	she	127	“ Just needs a little polish and freshening , ”
13623	13629	13619	13619	she	127	“ Maurice Bellitano carved that . ”
13634	13639	13630	13630	She	127	“ The Maurice Bellitano ? ”
13640	13661	13619	13619	she	127	“ That ’s my grandfather . Your dog chewed off the head of Maurice Bellitano ’s carving of my grandfather . ”
13662	13667	13668	13668	she	127	“ Oh , god , ”
13781	13788	13760	13760	she	127	“ Oh , no no no … ”
13919	13926	13927	13927	I	0	“ Do . Not . Move , ”
13930	13947	13948	13948	She	127	“ Do not think . Do not breathe . Do not move . Do you understand ? ”
13982	14005	13948	13948	She	127	“ My brain and my instincts are very much at odds over understanding right now , if I ’m being perfectly honest . ”
14006	14018	14019	14019	I	0	“ And for the love of god , do not talk . ”
14153	14164	14140	14140	he	104	“ Congratulations , Begonia . You ’re now my girlfriend . ”
14209	14216	14217	14217	He	104	“ I ’m sorry , what ? ”
14286	14301	14279	14279	I	0	“ Was that from Maurice ’s early years ? It has some inconsistencies from — ”
14302	14329	14279	14279	I	0	“ It ’s a Bellitano original , and yes , I can prove it . Even if I could n’t , who would the courts believe ? ”
14330	14386	14279	14279	I	0	“ Do you know that you have a choice every day to not be the kind of guy who thinks everything is a personal insult ? It ’s okay to let things go . Research says it actually makes us happier to assume everyone around us has good intentions and sometimes screw - ups happen . ”
14434	14494	14421	14421	he	104	“ I can bill you for the damages to that statue , among the rest of the damages you ’ve caused to this house and the grounds , or we can come to an alternate arrangement whereby you present yourself to my mother and the world as my girlfriend , and I do n’t financially ruin you for life . ”
14517	14526	14501	14501	him	104	“ You live in a very strange world . ”
14527	14550	14421	14421	he	104	“ Two weeks , you said you paid for ? That ’s plenty of time for us to get engaged as well . ”
14551	14555	14640	14640	He	104	“ Excuse you ? ”
14556	14639	14640	14640	He	104	“ We wo n’t get married . The very idea of it is beyond comprehension , and the legalities would be a larger headache than it would be worth . But I have no desire to be inundated with family trying to save me from my bachelorhood now that the entire world is watching me , and you have very few options for enjoying the rest of your vacation , much less your entire life , if you do n’t sign here . ”
14711	14716	14695	14695	his	108	“ What is this ? ”
14762	14961	15030	15030	His	706	“ Oh my god , is this a set - up ? Did Hyacinth win some kind of win a date with your favorite celebrity game , and give the prize to me instead , and then Jonas could n’t make it ? You knew I was here . Is Jonas coming ? Oh my god . I have n’t watched his movies in at least eight years . They all got to be the same after a while , you know ? Do n’t tell him I said that . And then Chad did n’t like anything with actors who were more handsome than he was , because Chad was a douchewaffle , and I can call him that because my therapist says I should n’t feel bad for not liking people on occasion , and people I ’m willing to divorce fall under the umbrella of people I ’m allowed to not like . I have n’t even watched the reruns of Hollybrook and Mistletoe that used to run each December . Do you still play that every year ? Has it aged okay ? I ca n’t remember all the specifics now , but I — ”
14962	15029	15030	15030	His	706	“ This is not a set - up , and you will not be meeting my brother . You ’ll be staying here , playing the part of my girlfriend , and distracting my mother and the rest of my family when they try to introduce me to women , and I ’ll be either working in the study or disappearing to New York for meetings . ”
15049	15055	15035	15035	his	706	“ If I absolutely must . ”
15103	15113	15099	15099	you	0	“ You have lost your ever - loving mind . ”
15114	15260	15099	15099	you	0	“ Quite the contrary . It ’s the most efficient plan . I have no desire to have my family parade me around like the last eligible duke in some nineteenth - century historical novel , and the only thing that will stop them is a belief that I ’m already involved with someone , and the further belief that if they do n’t back off , I will finally snap and marry someone so completely wrong for the role of my wife . You ’re here . I do n’t have to go search in town for anyone else , and you ’re clearly unsuitable . You ’ve passed an initial background check , you have nowhere to be until school begins again in late August , and I demand compensation for both damages and the inconvenience of not being fucking asleep right now . ”
15261	15270	15099	15099	you	0	“ You ran a background check on me ? ”
15271	15368	15369	15369	I	0	“ Begonia Florence Fairchild , nee Bidelspach , formerly Dixon , employed by Tobin High School as an art teacher , three speeding tickets in the past year , your Netflix account is suspended because your credit card payment failed , daughter of Helen Nolan and Daniel Bidelspach , who divorced when you were seven . Father passed when you were seventeen . And if you spill the details of anything inside the agreement to your twin sister , Hyacinth , all will be null and void , and you ’ll owe me ten million dollars . ”
15383	15423	15369	15369	I	0	“ A more thorough background check is still ongoing , so if there ’s anything I need to know before I tell my mother I ’m madly in love with you , you ’d best speak up right now . ”
15424	15435	15436	15436	He	709	“ In love ? This is a set - up . ”
15439	15467	15436	15436	He	709	“ If this were a set - up , I would not have certain images in my head that make me finally understand the term brain bleach . ”
15493	15507	15488	15488	he	709	“ Now I see why Jonas is known as the charming Rutherford brother . ”
15508	15567	15474	15474	He	709	“ It ’s a fake relationship , Ms. Fairchild . I have no reason to charm you , whereas you have every reason to convince my mother that we ’re madly in love . You may take this very generous offer , or you may see me in court . I ’ll give you fifteen minutes to decide . ”
15568	15605	15488	15488	he	709	“ How do I know you ’re not a serial killer with enough money and family connections to cover up all your crimes and this is n’t just the way you play with your victims first ? ”
15606	15641	15642	15642	I	0	“ I suppose you do n’t . Fourteen minutes and fifty - two seconds , Ms. Fairchild . I ’m tired , and I expect my mother soon . You ’d best get reading . ”
15654	15671	15672	15672	He	710	“ Why do n’t you just tell your mother you do n’t want to date anyone ? ”
15697	15700	15672	15672	He	710	“ YMCA . ”
15750	15766	15767	15767	Hayes	104	“ It ’s almost adorable how little you know about the upper class , darling , ”
15773	15853	15767	15767	Hayes	104	“ Darling ? We need to work on terms of endearment . You . You need to work on terms of endearment . Also , you need to think this through a little more . Assuming I accept your argument that you , as a grown man , are incapable of just telling your mother you do n’t want to date anyone , what in the world makes you think she ’ll just accept that you ’re dating me ? ”
15854	16011	16012	16012	I	0	“ If she does n’t , I ’ll promise to go to the press with all the details about how we started dating before your divorce was finalized . And lest you think I ’m incapable myself of convincing my mother that I ’m in love , bear in mind that I ’ve been forced to watch Razzle Dazzle films from the cradle . I may not enjoy acting , and I may not understand the appeal of the god - awful films coming out of my family ’s company , but that does n’t mean I do n’t know how it ’s done , and if there ’s one thing I do very well , Ms. Fairchild , it ’s whatever I set my mind to . And I ’m determined to convince the world that I ’m very much in love with you . It ’s the most efficient way to restore my peace . ”
16276	16295	16269	16269	his	104	“ There are n’t any details about us dating before I was divorced , because we just met . ”
16296	16313	16325	16325	he	104	“ Once again , darling , you are so naïve in the ways of the world . ”
16349	16375	16339	16339	I	0	“ Just how terrifying is your mother , boo - berry ? She always seems so nice on talk shows and during red carpet interviews . ”
16384	16428	16339	16339	I	0	“ My mother is a menace . She wants me married . I ’m uninterested . So you ’ll run interference , I ’ll have peace and quiet , and I wo n’t tell her what happened to the statue of my grandfather . ”
16429	16437	16441	16441	you	0	“ Why does she want you married ? ”
16464	16473	16561	16561	He	732	“ Do you read the news , Begonia ? ”
16474	16560	16561	16561	He	732	“ Been a little busy getting divorced here , Hayes . Also , I gave up celebrity gossip around the time Violet Quinn checked into rehab and every channel had a live newsfeed of the clinic she was supposedly staying at . It felt like such a violation of her privacy when she was in such a low place , not to mention everyone else who could ’ve been exposed on national TV for being near the place , and it made my stomach hurt . ”
16586	16623	16566	16566	he	732	“ Eleven minutes , Ms. Fairchild . If you intend to reject my settlement offer , I suggest using your eleven minutes to gather what you can of your belongings before I forcibly throw you out . ”
16624	16789	16790	16790	Marshmallow	108	“ I ca n’t really be the best partner in crime if I do n’t know why we ’re committing the heist . Why does your mother want you married ? Is it like , normal mother stuff , with her insisting you ’ve waited long enough to give her grandbabies ? Does she still do your laundry and she ’s tired of it and wants another woman to take over raising you instead ? Oh my god . If you tell me you ’re gay and your family wo n’t accept that , I ’m sorry , I wo n’t be your fake girlfriend , but I will one thousand percent be the person who gets arrested for telling every last one of them off . Is that it ? Are you in love with a man ? Oh my god . Razzle Dazzle has never done a film with main characters who are n’t straight , have they ? Oh my god . ”
16825	16935	16810	16810	He	104	“ My mother knows better than to insist I raise a child merely to satisfy her urges to hold a baby . I ’m well aware of how to send my laundry out for cleaning without needing any assistance , along with conducting every other chore and task necessary to be a fully - functioning adult . And I am not in love with a man , but you ’re still welcome to give my mother an earful about the homogeny of Razzle Dazzle ’s films . Congratulations , Ms. Fairchild . You ’ve just convinced me more than ever that you ’re the right woman for the job . ”
16960	16968	16942	16942	my	0	“ Did you just call me attractive ? ”
16969	17061	16942	16942	my	0	“ Dear god , no . Rather annoying , actually . Which is perfect . My mother will have her hands so full trying to get rid of you that she ’ll leave me alone completely . Add in her fear that I ’ll find someone even worse after you if she does n’t back off , and this is perfect . The document , Ms. Fairchild . Last chance . Are we doing this the easy way , or shall I get my attorney and the sheriff on the phone ? ”
17253	17280	17284	17284	she	357	“ So if we ’ve been talking on the internet for the past six months , that means we ’ll know a lot about each other , ”
17292	17323	17324	17324	She	357	“ Moby Dick ? Really ? Do you read it , or is it a conversation piece ? There ’s nothing wrong with reading commercial fiction instead of literary classics . ”
17338	17353	17324	17324	She	357	“ The only story we need is that you find cranky assholes irresistibly charming . ”
17354	17374	17284	17284	she	357	“ That ’s the plot of half the Razzle Dazzle films . No one ’s going to believe it . ”
17375	17427	17428	17428	She	744	“ Quite frankly , Ms. Fairchild , I do n’t need my mother to believe us . I merely need her to know I ’ll make the family look bad in the press if she insists on presenting me with a parade of eligible women she ’d like me to marry . ”
17432	17504	17428	17428	She	744	“ I don’t — oh . Oh . It ’s not about telling your mom no , is it ? It ’s about the time and energy it takes every time she throws another woman at you . Or is it about disappointing your mother ? Do you have mommy issues ? I never thought I did until I announced I was divorcing Chad , and now I ’m the disappointment . ”
17505	17528	17284	17284	she	357	“ Congratulations , Ms. Fairchild , you have confirmed that you do , in fact , listen three percent of the time . ”
17529	17565	17566	17566	She	745	“ My listening skills are fine . It ’s your communication skills that need work . You had two options there , and you just said I listened . That ’s not answering the question . ”
17645	17670	17684	17684	she	745	“ One more thing you ’ll be certain to tell my mother you find charming about me . Where the devil did you hide — ”
17716	17721	17722	17722	Begonia	147	“ Oh , visitors ! ”
17736	17773	17722	17722	Begonia	147	“ Do n’t worry , I ’ll send them away . Unless they brought food . I definitely need to get over to town to get some food , since Marshmallow ruined everything in the fridge . ”
17774	17780	17781	17781	I	0	“ Do n’t tell them — ”
17819	17822	17785	17785	she	745	“ Hello ? ”
17823	17852	17853	17853	My	0	“ Hello , this is Mayor Kristine Turner . We heard the owner ’s back in residence . Just wanted to check and see if he needs anything ? ”
17861	17866	17867	17867	I	0	“ Tell her no , ”
17880	17889	17890	17890	Begonia	147	“ Oh , no , we ’re good , ”
17893	17911	17890	17890	Begonia	147	“ I ’ll be coming into town in a little bit for supplies , but for now — ”
17912	17918	17919	17920	the mayor	752	“ I can bring supplies , ”
17923	17964	17919	17920	the mayor	752	“ Does Hayes need food ? What about his favorite wine ? My mom ’s happy to make him her famous sponge cake . We know how much he loves that . Is he still allergic to strawberries and dogs ? ”
17991	17999	17970	17970	I	0	“ I said , tell her no . ”
18000	18021	17919	17920	the mayor	752	“ Hayes . That ’s rude . Do n’t hang up on people . How do I call her back ? ”
18022	18038	17970	17970	I	0	“ You do n’t . No one in town needs to know I ’m here . ”
18039	18083	17970	17970	I	0	“ They already know you ’re here . Also , you ’re allergic to dogs ? How does she know you’re … oh my god . Did she pretend to be your girlfriend another time when you were hiding from your mother here ? ”
18115	18128	18098	18098	I	0	“ Do . Not . Pick . Up . The . Intercom . ”
18161	18164	18149	18149	her	754	“ Why ? ”
18208	18214	18190	18190	she	754	“ Because I said so . ”
18215	18237	18238	18238	She	754	“ Someone who knows you love her mother ’s sponge cake is clearly a friend , so what ’s the big — ”
18266	18280	18249	18249	Kristine	149	“ You dated her , did n’t you ? You seriously dated her . ”
18281	18298	18299	18299	She	754	“ Do not confirm for anyone that I ’m here . Have I made myself clear ? ”
18382	18470	18373	18373	She	754	“ There are fresh sheets in the laundry room . I ’ll go fix up the bed . Do you know when your mother ’s getting here ? I ’m great with parents , so if you wanted to go to sleep , you ’re welcome to , and you can trust me to charm the pants off your mother . Which guest room does she like ? I ’ll get that fixed up too , and take the one in the basement for me and Marshmallow . ”
18471	18487	18510	18510	She	756	“ Your dog can sleep in the basement . You ’ll be in my room . ”
18488	18491	18510	18510	She	756	“ I — ”
18492	18509	18510	18510	She	756	“ For the farce to work , Ms. Fairchild , you ’ll be in my room . ”
18539	18557	18525	18525	she	149	“ Can I at least tell the mayor I ’ll let her know if I need anything ? ”
18558	18561	18525	18525	she	149	“ No . ”
18562	18568	18525	18525	she	149	“ You ’re incredibly unreasonable . ”
18592	18601	18602	18602	She	756	“ It ’s a perk of being me . ”
18765	18782	18727	18727	he	104	“ I hope you ’re half as good with parents as you are at annoying me , ”
18797	18804	18727	18727	he	104	“ Mother . What a surprise , ”
19244	19269	19270	19270	Giovanna	150	“ See to it that my luggage is taken to the guest quarters upstairs and make Amelia comfortable in the room down the hall , ”
19274	19285	19270	19270	Giovanna	150	“ Charlotte will take the en suite in the basement . ”
19286	19294	19295	19295	Hayes	104	“ Carry your own luggage , Mother , ”
19298	19307	19295	19295	Hayes	104	“ Begonia is n’t here to serve you . ”
19308	19322	19323	19323	She	150	“ Ah , my sweet boy . So cranky when you ’re tired . ”
19355	19369	19329	19329	her	150	“ Have you had anything to eat today ? That never helps either . ”
19370	19376	19329	19329	her	150	“ Neither do uninvited guests . ”
19377	19380	19425	19425	Giovanna	150	“ Hayes . ”
19381	19384	19329	19329	her	150	“ Mother . ”
19385	19417	19418	19418	I	0	“ I realize you ’re old enough to take care of yourself , but it ’s been a difficult two weeks , and you should n’t be by yourself right now . ”
19446	19495	19496	19496	She	150	“ Mrs. Rutherford . Hi . I ’m Begonia . It is so good to meet you . Hayes has n’t told me much about you , but then , you could probably say the same about what he ’s told you about me , could n’t you ? ”
19555	19568	19569	19569	Giovanna	150	“ I ’m sorry , I have no idea who you are , ”
19628	19647	19648	19648	Hayes	104	“ Relax , darling , I ’m quite all right with it if she does n’t like you . ”
19794	19813	19814	19814	My	0	“ Begonia , meet my mother , Giovanna . Mother , this is Begonia Fairchild . My girlfriend . ”
19863	19868	19869	19869	she	2982	“ Ah , again ? ”
19980	19991	19992	19992	Hayes	147	“ Yes , Mother , I have a girlfriend again , ”
19995	20057	19992	19992	Hayes	147	“ Begonia and I met on a Snarflings World forum while I was incognito , moved private chats to phone calls , and I asked her to meet me here . She had no idea until this morning who I actually am , nor to whom I ’m related , and I ’d prefer if you do n’t make her uncomfortable . ”
20231	20242	20243	20243	Hayes	147	“ You can take your own luggage to your rooms , ”
20246	20264	20243	20243	Hayes	147	“ or , more preferably , to one of the other accommodations in town across the island . ”

20327	20335	20336	20336	Hayes	147	“ Begonia , this is Amelia Shawcross , ”
20339	20390	20336	20336	Hayes	147	“ We went to grade school together . And this is Charlotte , my mother ’s personal assistant who deserved a Sunday off but apparently did n’t get it . I assume there ’s a security detail making the rounds outside . You ’ll meet them soon enough as well . ”
20403	20413	20391	20391	Amelia	138	“ Hayes and I got married in second grade . ”
20414	20423	20424	20424	I	0	“ Oh , that must ’ve been adorable . ”
20429	20500	20424	20424	I	0	“ I married my dog when I was nine . My sister and I were arguing over who got to be the bride and who had to be the bridesmaid , so we decided to take turns , but when Mom heard me talking about a honeymoon with Oreo , she freaked out over what the neighbors would think , so Hyacinth never got to be Oreo ’s second wife . ”
20519	20525	20501	20501	Hayes	147	“ Is n’t she adorable ? ”
20526	20531	20501	20501	Hayes	147	“ Quite … normal . ”
20559	20597	20543	20543	Amelia	138	“ You probably should n’t tell that story in mixed company if you do n’t want stories about yourself having sex with a dog spread across the tabloids . Have you ever dated someone famous , Begonia ? ”
20598	20636	20637	20637	I	0	“ Just Oreo . He ate the mayor ’s wife ’s roses and made the local papers for it . Mostly because he was n’t smart enough to stop after the first thorn made his tongue bleed . ”
20672	20726	20649	20649	I	0	“ But I ’m attracted to smarter creatures now . And Oreo ’s tongue was okay . It was n’t as bad as the news made it sound . Plus , he was recovering from the ol’ snip - snip and still had a lot of painkillers in his body when it happened . ”
20867	20874	20875	20875	I	0	“ Are any of you hungry ? ”
20878	20959	20875	20875	I	0	“ I think we have crackers . There was , erm , a refrigerator malfunction , so we ’re out of butter . I can use the house phone to order a Tuber to have some lobster rolls delivered . Have you had the lobster rolls from Clickety Clack ? They ’re delicious . And I think it ’s adorable that there ’s a local named Mr. Tuberman who runs the Tuber . It ’s like Uber , but not . ”
20960	20974	20975	20975	Hayes	147	“ They know where Clickety Clack is if they ’re hungry , darling , ”
20986	20993	20994	20994	I	0	“ Do n’t be a bear , ”
20999	21009	20994	20994	I	0	“ They ’ll think I ’m a bad influence . ”
21010	21018	21019	21019	Amelia	138	“ It ’s not you , Bernardia , ”
21022	21025	21026	21026	Hayes	147	“ Begonia , ”
21029	21041	21026	21026	Hayes	147	“ Though I prefer to think of her as my bluebell . ”
21042	21054	21055	21056	Amelia Shawcross	138	“ Of course you do . I was always your azalea . ”
21068	21077	21026	21026	Hayes	147	“ You were on Dancing with the Stars . ”
21078	21085	21088	21088	Giovanna	150	“ Amelia ’s multi - talented . ”
21134	21177	21122	21122	She	150	“ She ’s quite brilliant in her day job on Wall Street , runs a popular finance blog , and would ’ve won that season if they had n’t let a former cheerleader with seven years of dance training into the competition . ”
21178	21183	21184	21184	I	0	“ You kicked ass , ”
21189	21264	21184	21184	I	0	“ I do n’t know how you kept up with everything while you were doing dance lessons for the show too . Seriously amazing . My sister and I could n’t stop talking about how we would ’ve been so exhausted after the first thirty minutes of rehearsals , but you killed it like a major lady boss . Such a great role model for young girls everywhere . High five , rock star . ”
21297	21307	21308	21308	I	0	“ You do n’t celebrate each other ’s successes ? ”
21311	21320	21321	21321	Hayes	147	“ And you wonder why I like her , ”
21632	21635	21645	21645	He	147	“ Hayes , ”
21727	21730	21760	21760	He	147	“ Dog ! ”
21749	21752	21737	21737	I	0	“ Marsh — ”
21753	21756	21757	21757	Hayes	147	“ Sit , ”
21886	21889	21898	21898	Hayes	147	“ Marshmallow . ”
21890	21897	21898	21898	Hayes	147	“ Put . It . Back , ”
21956	21960	21961	21961	I	0	“ Good boy , ”
22139	22146	22147	22147	Begonia	147	“ Are you mad at me ? ”
22159	22172	22153	22153	I	0	“ Whyever would I be angry with you , my darling bluebell ? ”
22173	22198	22153	22153	I	0	“ Sarcasm still is n’t attractive on you , but I ’d probably be cranky if I had n’t slept in seven days too . ”
22205	22217	22218	22218	she	842	“ You should ’ve told me about the weddings and funeral , ”
22221	22245	22218	22218	she	842	“ Your mother and Bachelorettes One and Two are not buying this fake relationship , because I do n’t know enough about you . ”
22405	22413	22414	22414	she	842	“ Were you close to your cousin ? ”
22417	22423	22414	22414	she	842	“ Begonia . Be quiet . ”
22424	22571	22635	22635	I	0	“ I did n’t sleep for almost a week after I moved into my apartment when I left Chad . I was bottling up everything inside , lying in bed at night second - guessing myself and wondering where I ’d gone wrong . I thought I could ’ve done something differently , and that I ’d been a bad wife when I ’d tried so hard to be a good wife . Then there was my mother , insisting I was a fool for leaving a decent man and that I ’d be alone forever . It took Hyacinth coming to see me and telling me she could n’t sleep because I could n’t sleep , and that we needed to talk it out so we could both sleep again . So we did . We talked it out , and then we both slept . ”
22583	22592	22635	22635	I	0	“ Why the hell could n’t Hyacinth sleep ? ”
22593	22612	22613	22613	I	0	“ Cosmic twin connection . Just like I had horrible cramps when she was in labor both times . ”
22958	22962	22963	22963	Begonia	127	“ Sit up , ”
23000	23006	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ What are you doing ? ”
23007	23036	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ Helping you get to sleep . Your mom said dogs and strawberries are your only allergies . You ’re not allergic to lavender too , are you ? ”
23037	23040	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ No . ”
23041	23066	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ Good . I lit some lavender incense . Breathe deep . It ’ll help you relax . And sit up and scoot down . ”
23067	23070	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ No . ”
23071	23086	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ Sit up and scoot down . Do n’t make me get your mother . ”
23087	23099	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ My mother would welcome any excuse to throw you out . ”
23100	23120	22994	22995	the woman	497	“ You really do n’t understand who you ’ve asked to be your fake girlfriend yet , do you ? ”
23267	23278	23279	23279	I	0	“ Yes , yes , you ’re a terrifying woman , ”
23282	23325	23279	23279	I	0	“ It was your master plan all along to lie in wait here so you could surprise the weird Rutherford brother and score yourself the last eligible billionaire on the planet , and now you have me right where you want me . ”
23350	23361	23346	23346	She	127	“ Sit . Up . And . Scoot . Down . ”
23401	23408	23397	23397	her	874	“ Lie down . Face up . ”
23409	23424	23376	23376	she	127	“ I ’m certainly not planning to return to that pillow face - down . ”
23425	23468	23469	23469	I	0	“ Do n’t be an ass . Lie down . I ’d very much like to not fake being madly in love with a grumpy - pants for the next two weeks , and that means you need to get some sleep ? ”
23507	23517	23518	23518	she	127	“ Close your eyes and take a deep breath , ”
23594	23602	23603	23603	she	127	“ Tell me if I hurt you , ”
23612	23618	23619	23619	she	127	“ Listen to the waves , ”
23627	23636	23619	23619	she	127	“ Just breathe and listen to the waves . ”
23723	23727	23728	23728	I	0	“ Strong fingers , ”
23731	23737	23728	23728	I	0	“ Is it too much ? ”
24440	24454	24428	24428	he	147	“ Darling , I told you not to leave the estate without security . ”
24664	24671	24672	24672	I	0	“ We were out of food . ”
24724	24735	24745	24745	Amelia	138	“ No strawberries . But I did get more cheesecake . ”
24736	24744	24745	24745	Amelia	138	“ This is what Charlotte is for , ”
24749	24842	24745	24745	Amelia	138	“ Oh , but I love the market . It ’s so quaint and charming , and they have a nut butter maker , and I got a sample of the most delicious fresh almond butter that I ’ve ever had in my life . Do n’t worry — I got a jar to share , because you have to taste this . It ’s so good . And the market also let Marshmallow in with me , and no one minded when he carried my mangos around the store for me . ”
24879	24893	24871	24871	he	147	“ Come , Begonia . Sit . I ’ll load up the bike — ”
24894	24922	24923	24923	Amelia	138	“ No , no , I ’ll ride it back , if you ’ll take the groceries . And I ’ll start brunch when I get home . ”
25216	25225	25227	25227	he	147	“ Get in the golf cart , Begonia . ”
25508	25516	25493	25493	I	0	“ No . Walk me home instead . ”
25534	25552	25522	25522	he	119	“ It ’s not safe to wander off the estate by yourself when you ’re dating me . ”
25564	25587	25553	25553	I	0	“ Are kidnappers going to dash out from behind that rock and carry me off to torture me behind the lobster shack ? ”
25588	25594	25553	25553	I	0	“ You ’re being ridiculous . ”
25595	25645	25553	25553	I	0	“ There is a possibility some nosy busybody with a camera will take our picture and perpetuate this crazy story where the world ’s last single billionaire is madly in love with a divorced art teacher from Virginia . That would probably be a serious hit to your reputation . ”
25793	25804	25829	25829	I	0	“ My patience is in short supply , Ms. Fairchild . ”
25805	25828	25829	25829	I	0	“ Then you definitely have to walk me back to your place . Just breathe that air . Is n’t it amazing ? ”
26120	26146	26147	26147	Amelia	138	“ Hayes , your mother wants to know if she should send Charlotte into town for coffee , or if we ’re bringing some back , ”
26159	26206	26150	26150	I	0	“ Everything ’s set in the pot in the kitchen . It ’s my special coffee - of - the - month - club coffee . From Ecuador this month . And it ’s delicious . All she has to do is hit the power button . ”
26220	26241	26213	26213	I	0	“ People in your social circles do know how to hit the power button on a coffee maker , right ? ”
26242	26251	26252	26252	I	0	“ If not , there ’s always Charlotte . ”
26255	26266	26252	26252	I	0	“ Did you — did you just make a joke ? ”
26267	26270	26271	26271	His	147	“ No . ”
26283	26296	26279	26279	I	0	“ Well , you should ’ve . Jokes lower blood pressure too . ”
26297	26312	26313	26313	I	0	“ So does getting home and getting to work . Get in the cart . ”
26372	26411	26417	26417	his	147	“ Walk me home . It ’ll take an hour , and it ’ll clear your head before you disappear to do all of your work and leave me to entertain your mother and your ex - wife . ”

26426	26493	26494	26494	I	0	“ Grade school wives who are super successful all on their own do n’t often come back when you ’re still single at your age , and when they do , they definitely do n’t get on a plane with your mother at the drop of a hat to go check on you at a secret hidey spot just because they had nothing better to do , ”
26497	26506	26494	26494	I	0	“ She ’s here because she wants you . ”
26507	26515	26538	26538	his	956	“ Congratulations on your powers of observation . ”
26516	26529	26530	26530	He	956	“ Walk with me . It ’s what a boyfriend would do . ”
26606	26609	26610	26610	Hayes	147	“ Amelia . ”
26627	26639	26610	26610	Hayes	147	“ We ’ll be walking home . Please take the groceries . ”
26644	26652	26610	26610	Hayes	147	“ Are you sure that ’s safe ? ”
26653	26666	26667	26667	I	0	“ I have the mayor on speed - dial if anything happens . ”
26804	26816	26817	26817	Amelia	138	“ There ’s no room for the bike on the cart , ”
26820	26832	26817	26817	Amelia	138	“ And there ’s no room in the security cart either . ”
26833	26840	26841	26841	I	0	“ We ’ll walk it back , ”
26845	26851	26841	26841	I	0	“ Along with — Marshmallow ! ”
26886	26889	26890	26890	Hayes	147	“ Down , ”
27059	27073	27074	27074	I	0	“ Hayes ! Hayes , hi . Everything okay out at the estate ? ”
27137	27174	27126	27126	Begonia	147	“ She ca n’t hurt you . She ’d get fired as mayor , and trust me , after what I heard at the market this morning , that ’s the last thing she ’d jeopardize . ”
27175	27190	27192	27192	I	0	“ For the record , this is the last place I want to be . ”
27226	27244	27245	27245	Begonia	147	“ But it ’s such a beautiful morning . That has to make it a little better , ”
27315	27327	27328	27328	Kristine	149	“ I ’m so glad I ran into you this morning , ”
27392	27417	27418	27418	I	0	“ Seems like you might be having connection problems with your gate intercom system . Hamish is still around if you need an electrician . ”
27443	27450	27430	27430	she	149	“ Ms. Turner . Lovely weather . ”
27451	27455	27456	27456	Begonia	147	“ Good job , ”
27486	27559	27560	27560	She	149	“ I called the sheriff ’s office up at the point and let them know you were back , so they ’re watching out for any unusual activity , though I see you ’re not as alone as we thought you were . And we activated the Oysterberry Bay gossip chain . Nobody ’s gon na bug you , and if you need anything at all , just give me a holler . ”
27677	27684	27685	27685	she	149	“ Glad to see you back , ”
27688	27748	27685	27685	she	149	“ I tried to get in touch when Blaine left and his girlfriend stayed , because it felt unusual , but nobody at your office returned my calls . The sheriff checked in every now and again , and it did n’t seem like she was robbing you , so we had no choice but to let it go . ”
27935	27944	27945	27945	Begonia	147	“ I love your island here , Kristine , ”
27952	27970	27945	27945	Begonia	147	“ Everyone ’s so friendly , and the shops are adorable . You must love living here . ”
27985	28004	27971	27971	Kristine	149	“ Could n’t imagine living anywhere else . Great place for keeping in touch with what ’s important . ”
28005	28044	27945	27945	Begonia	147	“ You can really feel the love all over . This is the best hidden gem I ’ve ever visited . But do n’t worry — I wo n’t tell anyone . Too many tourists would ruin it . ”
28045	28052	27971	27971	Kristine	149	“ We aim for just right . ”

28167	28173	28174	28174	Begonia	147	“ We should get going , ”
28178	28233	28234	28234	She	1020	“ Lots to do today . Thank you so much for all of your kindness . Marshmallow ! Drop the crab and c’m on , boy . You do n’t want that thing biting your nose or tongue or your ears . Who ’s a good dog ? Marshmallow ’s such a good dog . ”
28245	28267	28234	28234	She	1020	“ He ’s smart , but not always bright , you know ? And we love him exactly as he is . ”
28464	28471	28472	28472	I	0	“ Why did you get divorced ? ”
28602	28610	28657	28657	She	1028	“ He did n’t like my dog . ”
28611	28624	28657	28657	She	1028	“ You did n’t adopt the dog until after you filed paperwork . ”
28625	28640	28657	28657	She	1028	“ Just how thorough was that background check , and did you memorize it ? ”
28641	28656	28657	28657	She	1028	“ Why did you get divorced ? As your boyfriend , I should know . ”
28665	28696	28657	28657	She	1028	“ You should , should n’t you ? Okay . I ’ll tell you . But first , you have to tell me if you ’ve ever had a pet . ”
28770	28792	28766	28766	they	1029	“ You do n’t want to ask how many other women will be arriving on my doorstep vying for my attention ? ”
28793	28954	28955	28955	Her	1032	“ Oh , you think there ’ll be more ? Will there be any actresses ? Oh ! What about famous artists ? Wait . They probably do n’t want you for your money , and your personality is n’t exactly the type that usually jives with artists . We like to be the temperamental ones in a relationship , and we love being broke , because it gives us something to complain about . Oh , barf . Tell me you ’re not expecting a bunch of lady CEOs . Do n’t get me wrong , I admire the crap out of them for the things they accomplish , and Amelia is lovely in her own way — I mean , she ca n’t be barf when she was on Dancing with the Stars — but give me someone who wants to talk about how difficult clay can be in humidity , and I ’ll have a new BFF . ”
28978	28987	28988	28988	She	1032	“ Clay is related to bank failure Fridays ? ”
28999	29021	28988	28988	She	1032	“ You did it again . You made a joke . Sleeping was really good for you , was n’t it ? ”
29022	29051	28960	28960	she	1032	“ Please tell me you do n’t drink coffee . Or that you ’ve already had six cups today . One or the other . Nothing in between . ”
29052	29073	29074	29074	I	0	“ Nope . I ’m riding the high from horrifying your mother when she came into our bedroom last night . ”
29080	29090	29074	29074	I	0	“ My mother came into the bedroom last night ? ”
29097	29105	29074	29074	I	0	“ What did you say to her ? ”
29106	29127	29128	29128	She	1034	“ I shushed her and told her you ’d had a few long days and that you needed your sleep . ”
29133	29166	29130	29130	her	1034	“ She was really horrified . Is it a Rutherford family thing that you ’re not supposed to be shirtless with a woman in bed in real life in your own home ? ”
29167	29170	29171	29171	She	1034	“ Yes . ”
29190	29252	29185	29185	she	1034	“ Is it the hair dye ? I was worried yesterday about leaving it on too long , but I actually like how bright it turned out . It ’s like , hello , world , Begonia is ready to experience all of you again . But hair dye is n’t against your family ’s principles and image , is it ? ”
29253	29262	29130	29130	her	1034	“ Yes . It ’s the hair dye . ”
29263	29282	29130	29130	her	1034	“ Are you always a bad liar , or are you just trying to make me stop talking ? ”
29283	29286	29287	29289	The confounding woman	1035	“ Yes . ”
29292	29398	29287	29289	The confounding woman	1035	“ So sleep does n’t make you more charming . Noted . Were you up early enough to see the sun rise ? It was glorious this morning . Like Monet painted it . I know it ’s totally cliché for an art teacher to say Monet ’s her favorite , when I could pick Berthe Morisot or Alfred Sisley , or a non - impressionist , but Monet ’s colors are like — looking at his water lilies collection is like seeing the full potential of my soul on display . They make me happy and peaceful and hopeful all at the same time . ”
29402	29411	29287	29289	The confounding woman	1035	“ Have you been to Musée Marmottan Monet ? ”
29412	29449	29450	29450	Her	1036	“ No , but it ’s totally on the bucket list . I started a Paris fund the day I left Chad , and if I budget right , I can get there in two years . ”
29524	29576	29577	29577	She	1036	“ When I was six , my parents got us a puppy for the holidays . I came down with a horrible cold the same day and lived in utter misery for a week while hugging that damn dog at every opportunity until my nanny suggested I was allergic to it . ”
29582	29591	29577	29577	She	1036	“ I ’m sorry . That ’s heartbreaking . ”
29592	29605	29577	29577	She	1036	“ We had fish tanks instead for the rest of my childhood . ”
29606	29697	29577	29577	She	1036	“ My dad ran a summer camp . Mom hated it , which is why they got divorced , but I loved it . Hyacinth and I spent every summer there , running wild and playing on the ropes course and shooting archery and swimming in the pool and riding horses and fishing in the lake . We had minnows for bait , but neither of us could bear to actually hook them , so we ’d sneak them back to our cabin and try to raise them as pets . ”
29698	29708	29709	29709	Her	1039	“ We had jellyfish and stingrays in our tanks . ”
29729	29735	29724	29724	she	1039	“ Of course you did . ”
29743	29757	29758	29758	She	1039	“ There was a very large grouper that I named O - face . ”
29761	29766	29758	29758	She	1039	“ You did n’t . ”
29767	29802	29803	29803	Her	1039	“ I was informed quickly that the grouper preferred to not be mocked for its expression , and it was renamed Theodore . And the octopus that I named Octopussy was rapidly renamed Harrison . ”
29902	29919	29920	29920	Begonia	127	“ Hyacinth named an entire batch of minnows after all the roles Jonas played one summer , ”
29935	29944	29945	29945	she	127	“ Do you not get along with Jonas ? ”
29948	29963	29945	29945	she	127	“ Or does it just annoy you that everyone thinks he ’s so perfect ? ”
29964	29989	29888	29888	She	1039	“ You accused me of setting you up yesterday , but I ’m beginning to wonder if the opposite is true , Ms. Fairchild . ”
29990	30173	29920	29920	Begonia	127	“ Do n’t Ms. Fairchild me , Mr. Rutherford . I saw you in dancing hamster pajama pants . Fancy does n’t work between us anymore . Also , I work with teenagers , and I have yet to see any set of siblings who adore each other all the time , even the ones who like each other most of the time . It ’s not natural to not have conflict with your family . If Hyacinth was as famous as Jonas is , I ’d probably sigh like that too . And we might be twins and adore each other , but we fight plenty too . Hello ? Signed non - disclosure agreement ? You have a very rare opportunity to bare your soul to someone who wo n’t repeat a word , wo n’t judge you and who ’s had enough therapy in the past year to probably say some very insightful things about your life that just might make you smile more often . Hit me with it . What ’s the story with you and Jonas ? ”
30174	30179	29945	29945	she	127	“ He got married . ”
30180	30188	29888	29888	She	1039	“ You wanted his wife for yourself ? ”
30189	30219	29920	29920	Begonia	127	“ Dear god , no . I did n’t want to be the richest single man in the world . It makes me a target for more attention than — ”
30220	30223	30224	30224	someone	341	“ Hayes ! ”
30231	30250	30224	30224	someone	341	“ Oh my gosh , Hayes ! That is you . Hi ! Hi , I ’m Martina . ”
30251	30260	30261	30261	I	0	“ In short , it makes that happen , ”
30267	30273	30274	30274	Begonia	127	“ Back off , lady , ”
30277	30283	30274	30274	Begonia	127	“ This one ’s mine . ”
30294	30318	30284	30286	The elderly woman	1045	“ Well , are n’t you an impertinent little twit . I was just being friendly to a neighbor I ’ve never met . ”
30322	30342	30343	30343	Martina	174	“ Sorry . I ’m terribly jealous . I thought you wanted him for his butt in these jeans . ”
30348	30384	30343	30343	Martina	174	“ If I did want him , and I ’m not saying I do , but if I did , could you blame me ? I might be old , but I ’m not blind . ”
30385	30395	30396	30396	Begonia	127	“ Keep being fabulous and putting yourself out there . ”
30440	30476	30477	30477	Begonia	127	“ We need to get going . Hayes is late for work , and if he does n’t work , he ca n’t afford to treat me to a lobster dinner on a sunset cruise . ”
30485	30523	30480	30482	The old lady	1047	“ Oh , you ’re a cheeky one . A billionaire not affording a lobster dinner . Ha ! Come say hi at the flower shop , Hayes . Your girlfriend deserves it . I like her . ”
30524	30533	30534	30534	I	0	“ How the devil do you do that ? ”
30554	30558	30539	30539	she	127	“ Do what ? ”
30559	30567	30539	30539	she	127	“ Make friends with anything that moves . ”
30568	30604	30539	30539	she	127	“ All people just want to be accepted for who they are . It ’s not that hard to tell someone they have a nice haircut or a great smile or excellent taste in butts . ”
30605	30610	30539	30539	she	127	“ That sounds exhausting . ”
30611	30628	30539	30539	she	127	“ It brings me so much joy to see people happy . Way worth the effort . ”
30629	30633	30539	30539	she	127	“ All people ? ”
30634	30693	30539	30539	she	127	“ I do n’t like to think about people who do n’t deserve to be happy , which means I basically refuse to acknowledge they exist , unless I have to , like when I think they ’re a tuxedo - clad murderer bursting into my bathroom , so in my little world , yes . All people . ”
30956	30995	30937	30937	she	127	“ Your mom said you just took over as the Chief Financial Officer for Razzle Dazzle — does that mean long hours and endless meetings ? And can you really do it from here with limited cell service ? ”
30996	31005	31006	31006	I	0	“ We ’ll go to Paris this weekend , ”
31012	31015	31009	31009	She	127	“ What ? ”
31016	31063	31064	31064	She	127	“ You ’ve never seen Musée Marmottan Monet . A weekend trip to Paris for you to see Monet ’s waterlilies is pocket change to me , and an impromptu date in Europe will solidify the rumors that I am not , in fact , eligible . ”
31076	31087	31064	31064	She	127	“ But — but I have n’t earned it yet . ”
31088	31093	31009	31009	She	127	“ You — pardon ? ”
31094	31286	31287	31287	She	1054	“ It ’s an incredibly generous offer . I do n’t mean to imply I do n’t appreciate it . I do . That ’s so thoughtful and kind , but while it ’s pocket change to you , to me , it ’s the entire experience of saving and anticipating and savoring the idea . Like Christmas morning . Do you live for those five minutes when you ’re tearing through the wrapping paper , or do you live for the months from the minute you start making your wish list and talking to your friends about what you ’re hoping to get ? And like , dreaming about the pony you ’ll find in the backyard , even knowing that your dad declared bankruptcy this year and ca n’t afford a pony . Plus knowing that your mom and stepdad would never get you anything that would make poop that has to be cleaned . But you spend all those months dreaming and waiting anyway until that moment when you see the tree and the presents under it , and it ’s like , the joy of the possible ? ”
31315	31331	31303	31303	I	0	“ You would rather anticipate seeing your favorite paintings than actually see your favorite paintings ? ”
31341	31394	31338	31338	her	1054	“ Never mind . You ’re right . We should go to Paris . It ’ll keep up appearances . Marshmallow ! Sweetie , do n’t eat the rock . Where did — oh . Yes . Okay , good boy . Good boy helping push the bike back to the house . ”
31426	31445	31446	31446	She	1054	“ He could ’ve made such a great service dog , but he does n’t take orders well . ”
31460	31573	31452	31452	she	1054	“ He knows how to do all the things , but it ’s like he ’s missing that part of his brain where he understands that he ’s supposed to do it when people tell him to , instead of when he wants to . And he went through three owners who thought it was cute at first and then could n’t live with him , and so I adopted him because he deserves to be loved for who he is , flaws and all , and so do I , so we make a good pair . Especially now that I ’ve figured out how to Marshmallow - proof my apartment . ”
31587	31624	31579	31579	She	1056	“ The animal will survive without you for a weekend . I have competent staff who can arrive within a day to learn his eccentricities before we depart . And we need to keep up appearances . ”
31637	31652	31625	31625	She	1056	“ I do n’t actually have a passport . That ’s the other issue . ”
31653	31661	31627	31627	her	1056	“ I ’ll make a phone call . ”
31662	31667	31627	31627	her	1056	“ That ’s cheating . ”
31668	31779	31780	31780	She	1058	“ I live in a world where my every public move is under scrutiny , where I ’m judged based on the fantasy world of the films my family puts out into the world rather than on the world we actually live in , where people befriend me for every reason except enjoying my company , and where my acquaintances are just as likely to double - cross me as they are to follow through on their promises . So if the other side of that coin is that I can make a phone call to have a passport application expedited , then I ’ll make the damn phone call . ”
31794	31806	31780	31780	She	1058	“ You ’re very suspicious of the world and its intentions . ”
31807	31816	31780	31780	She	1058	“ Welcome to my life , Ms. Fairchild . ”
31817	31825	31780	31780	She	1058	“ So why do you trust me ? ”
31826	31847	31780	31780	She	1058	“ I do n’t so much trust you as I trust that I can destroy you if I need to . ”
32146	32161	32162	32162	she	127	“ I ’ll find a sitter for Marshmallow and go to Paris with you , ”
32166	32173	32162	32162	she	127	“ but only on one condition . ”
32174	32190	32162	32162	she	127	“ You ’re mistaken if you think you have room for negotiation , Ms. Fairchild . ”
32191	32206	32207	32207	she	127	“ I ’ll find a sitter for Marshmallow and go to Paris with you , ”
32210	32224	32207	32207	she	127	“ and in return , I want you to have sex with me . ”
32272	32277	32278	32278	I	0	“ There it is , ”
32281	32295	32278	32278	I	0	“ We ’ll be ending this relationship the minute we get back to — ”
32296	32315	32259	32259	she	127	“ Quit being a pompous ass who thinks this is about me taking advantage of you and listen . ”
32344	32381	32382	32382	she	127	“ You do n’t have to kiss me , you do n’t have to look at me , we do n’t have to have the lights on , and we can keep touching to a minimum , ”
32385	32426	32382	32382	she	127	“ There will definitely be multiple forms of birth control in place , and I ’ll sign whatever you need me to sign , agreeing to whatever you need me to agree to in the event of something unexpected happening . ”
32437	32543	32433	32433	she	127	“ I just — I have n’t slept with anyone since Chad , and I want to move on . Physically . I need to take that leap , and I ’m not quite afraid of it , but I have n’t been putting myself out there either , and you ’re here , and we ’re pretending to be dating , and you ’ve already seen me naked , and your mother caught us in bed together , and I would n’t even care if you wanted to call me by someone else ’s name to make it palatable enough for you , so — ”
32563	32645	32554	32554	she	1076	“ Never mind . Never mind . Forget I said anything . This is a terrible idea . I ’m done talking . Fine . We ’ll go to Paris . I ’ll ask Kristine for someone here on the island who ’s good with strong - willed and over - trained dogs , and I ’ll go pop my post - divorce cherry with some lovely fisherman in the village once our two weeks of fake - dating is over . ”
32922	32925	32908	32908	Begonia	127	“ Begonia . ”
32926	32958	32974	32974	Her	479	“ I know , I know . We have to get back to the house together and look like everything ’s fine . Just — I need a minute , okay ? ”
32959	32962	32908	32908	Begonia	127	“ Begonia . ”
32963	32966	32967	32967	She	479	“ What ? ”
33032	33080	33026	33026	you	1092	“ I ’ll be finished with work by four , so we can take the sunset cruise for dinner . If you do n’t have a dress you ’d like to wear , I ’ll have Charlotte take you into town to go shopping . My treat . ”
33081	33091	33119	33119	I	0	“ I do n’t want your money , Hayes . ”
33092	33114	33115	33115	She	1094	“ You ca n’t fake - date a billionaire without taking advantage of it , bluebell . It ’s just money . ”
33153	33160	33161	33161	she	1094	“ Thank you for your generosity , ”
33166	33232	33161	33161	she	1094	“ I ’m sure I have a dress in my luggage that will work , but if I have to be in something new to be seen in public with you , I ’ll clear my calendar for this afternoon and go shopping with your mother ’s personal assistant . I ’m sure it ’ll be a wonderful time to get to know her better . ”
33359	33365	33366	33366	She	826	“ Good morning , dear . ”
33465	33468	33469	33469	she	826	“ Begonia , ”
33481	33491	33469	33469	she	826	“ You ’re looking fresh and lovely this morning . ”
33512	33528	33531	33531	I	0	“ Thank you , Mrs. Rutherford . You look like you belong in a movie . ”
33549	33558	33559	33559	Hayes	163	“ She ’s had a lot of practice , ”
33955	33959	33960	33960	Hayes	163	“ Close it , ”
33986	33992	33993	33993	I	0	“ I ’ll get it . ”
34052	34058	34059	34059	Giovanna	150	“ What a sweet dog . ”
34066	34078	34059	34059	Giovanna	150	“ Go take your Benadryl and stop tormenting the poor thing . ”
34292	34300	34301	34301	I	0	“ I ’ll finish chopping the vegetables , ”
34357	34370	34457	34457	he	163	“ You can go put your feet up and enjoy your coffee . ”
34371	34380	34457	34457	he	163	“ Nonsense . We ’ll chop vegetables together . ”
34381	34386	34387	34387	Hayes	163	“ Where ’s Charlotte ? ”
34390	34449	34387	34387	Hayes	163	“ Sleeping in . She ’s earned a day or two off after all the wedding excitement . Shoo . Go on . We know you ca n’t wait to get back to work . Begonia will come find you when brunch is ready . But let me get you a cup of coffee . It ’s delicious . ”
34508	34515	34516	34516	he	163	“ You ’re going home today , ”
34628	34640	34641	34641	Giovanna	150	“ No , I think we ’ll stay another few days , ”
34644	34707	34641	34641	Giovanna	150	“ Amelia has n’t been out here since you were teenagers , and I promised her we ’d explore town together . There ’s a lovely new art gallery I have n’t seen yet . And then I get to know Begonia better , and we all make sure you ’re not working too hard . Goodness knows that takes a village . ”
34797	34804	34805	34805	Hayes	163	“ You ’re going home today , ”
34886	34900	34883	34883	her	150	“ Hayes , the house is plenty big enough for all of us — ”
34901	34914	34883	34883	her	150	“ Which does n’t change the fact that you were n’t invited . ”
34915	34953	34883	34883	her	150	“ I do n’t care if you ’re ten or sixty , I ’m your mother , and I know when you ’re in a mood and need to be checked on . This lone wolf routine — ”
34954	34974	34883	34883	her	150	“ Yes , I ’m clearly alone and suffering for being here for a private getaway with my girlfriend . ”
35044	35058	35026	35026	Hayes	163	“ Begonia and I will join you in New York early next week . ”
35103	35107	35108	35108	Giovanna	150	“ Next week ? ”
35111	35129	35130	35130	he	163	“ I ’m fully equipped to telework from here while I learn my new role this week , ”
35139	35153	35130	35130	he	163	“ And then I get to spend the weekend with Begonia without you . ”
35154	35157	35180	35180	he	163	“ Hayes — ”
35158	35170	35171	35171	I	0	“ I want time alone with my girlfriend . Go away . ”
35255	35268	35240	35240	Hayes	163	“ Thank you , bluebell . Just the way I like it . ”
35269	35272	35273	35273	I	0	“ Wait , ”
35293	35297	35273	35273	I	0	“ Cinnamon first . ”
35345	35357	35358	35358	Giovanna	150	“ Hayes does n’t take cinnamon in his coffee , dear , ”
35361	35376	35377	35377	I	0	“ He ’s trying my favorite since I could n’t shut up about it , ”
35387	35399	35384	35384	Hayes	163	“ Begonia insisted it ’s delicious , and she ’s right . ”
35468	35481	35482	35482	Hayes	163	“ Remember , darling , you promised no tomatoes in those eggs , ”
35517	35529	35530	35530	I	0	“ Making you happy is my favorite thing in the world , ”
35657	35668	35669	35669	Hayes	163	“ If only I did n’t have to work today , ”
35780	35819	35777	35777	he	163	“ Delicious . I ’ll never drink coffee another way again . Mother . Pack your bags . You can stay for brunch , and then you ’re leaving by two . I ’ll book your ferry myself . ”
35852	35866	35867	35867	she	150	“ So he ’s not your first boyfriend who likes to issue orders ? ”
35870	35876	35867	35867	she	150	“ He ’s a man . ”
35881	35897	35877	35877	I	0	“ We have to put up with the ego to get the rest of them . ”
35984	36000	36001	36001	she	150	“ Oh , goodness . Snort - laughing does n’t happen often , does it ? ”
36036	36043	36044	36044	Amelia	163	“ Giovanna ? Are you okay ? ”
36106	36115	36098	36098	Giovanna	150	“ Begonia has quite the sense of humor . ”
36152	36162	36163	36163	Amelia	163	“ A sense of humor is a nice change , ”
36166	36180	36163	36163	Amelia	163	“ Did n’t you say his last girlfriend was an engineering grad student ? ”
36181	36187	36188	36188	I	0	“ Oh , what kind ? ”
36191	36280	36188	36188	I	0	“ My stepfather ’s a civil engineer . You would n’t think he had a sense of humor , but Hyacinth and I used to distract him all the time with knock - knock jokes . It ’d take him out of a bad mood like that . Mostly because he had about seven thousand of them memorized , and we only had to laugh at the first dozen or so before he ’d yell for my mom to come listen too , and then we ’d disappear . ”
36302	36314	36288	36288	her	150	“ You ’re quite laid - back , are n’t you ? ”
36325	36385	36386	36386	I	0	“ The sun ’s shining , the scenery is gorgeous , and I have a cantankerous boyfriend with a heart of gold under all his gruff . What ’s to be upset about ? Unless you ’re the kind who gets hangry , I suppose . Marshmallow ! Put the knife down . You know you ca n’t cook . ”
36421	36433	36434	36434	Amelia	163	“ It ’s interesting that Hayes does n’t mind your dog . ”
36452	36481	36434	36434	Amelia	163	“ He made me give up my dog when we got married in second grade , and I ’d swear he ’s only gotten more uptight since then . ”
36482	36491	36492	36492	I	0	“ Oh , he does n’t like Marshmallow . ”
36502	36545	36492	36492	I	0	“ I gave him an ultimatum . Me with the dog , or no me at all . Honestly , I thought he ’d tell me to pack my bags , but I guess I ’m worth taking daily allergy medicine for . ”
36565	36575	36576	36576	Giovanna	150	“ Do you have plans this afternoon , Begonia ? ”
36579	36591	36576	36576	Giovanna	150	“ We ’d love to have you join us in town . ”
36592	36597	36598	36598	Amelia	138	“ Such a treat , ”
36814	36819	36820	36820	I	0	“ You’re … staying ? ”
36827	36840	36841	36841	she	127	“ Cantankerous with a heart of gold , I believe you said ? ”
36844	36876	36841	36841	she	127	“ After two weddings and that devastating funeral , you ’ll excuse me if I want to make sure he ’s fine for myself . Do you have children , Begonia ? ”
36877	36881	36789	36789	She	127	“ Just Marshmallow . ”
36882	36977	36841	36841	she	127	“ I could n’t sleep if I was n’t here to see for myself that he ’s fine . It does n’t matter how old or self - sufficient your children get , there ’s no replacing a mother ’s worry . So forgive me for staying an extra day to take my son ’s new girlfriend shopping while still hovering closely enough to be here if he needs me . My security team is excellent , so we wo n’t have to worry about being interrupted if we do n’t want to be . ”

38386	38392	38381	38381	Her	1230	“ It ’s not important . ”
38426	38442	38412	38412	she	1230	“ How many excursions and side trips had you booked that you ’ve now changed ? ”
38443	38449	38371	38371	she	1230	“ It does n’t matter . ”

38454	38553	38412	38412	she	1230	“ Shh . Your name - saying privileges have been revoked . Actually , your talking privileges have been revoked , period . I ’m trying to tell you that I ’m going to get on that boat , but I ’m a little nervous because the last time , Hyacinth saved me , and she ’s not here , so if I fall off the boat and once again come face - to - face with a killer manatee who decides I need to be his lover , I wo n’t have her twinstinct to save me . ”
38554	38568	38371	38371	she	1230	“ There are no manatees in Maine , and even if there were — ”
38569	38675	38412	38412	she	1230	“ But there are other sea creatures , and they ’re like Marshmallow . They ’re not normal when I ’m around . Manatees are n’t killer , I know , but I swear to you , that manatee had a look in his eyes that either meant , you ’re the girl I ’ve been waiting for , Begonia , which is totally creepy , by the way , or you are the prey I ’ve been waiting for , Begonia . I ’m a very good swimmer , but if I fall off this boat , there ’s no telling what might happen . ”
38716	38802	38711	38711	she	1232	“ Fine . Fine . I ’ll get on the boat . It ’s an adventure , and I wanted an adventure , and I know that you ’re so big and powerful that you ’ll order the seas to quit chopping and they ’ll calm down and rainbows will appear and three whales will serenade us with a blowhole symphony , from a safe distance , of course , and everyone in town will talk about how talented you are for decades to come . ”
38827	39039	38823	38823	she	1232	“ And it was n’t a horny manatee . I lied . I made up the lie , and Hyacinth told it so many times I started to believe it , but the truth is , I actually get seasick , and I hate that I get seasick , because I want to go cruise around the world but the one time Chad and I took a cruise , I puked on the first day and got put in quarantine in the ship ’s hospital because they were afraid I had norovirus , and being in an enclosed space on a cruise ship meant that I was ill the entire trip , so I did n’t enjoy it at all , and I really , really want to learn to enjoy it , but I do n’t want to puke in front of your mom and your second - grade ex - wife and your mom ’s Hayes - hungry assistant , and if I ’m puking , and I do fall overboard , I do n’t know if I ’ll actually be able to swim , because you ca n’t swim while you ’re puking . I can kayak . I can canoe . But I ca n’t freaking sail . ”

39125	39166	39120	39120	I	0	“ nor will you fall off , nor will you throw up , but if any or all of the above happen , I swear on my firm belief in the magic of the world , Marshmallow will save you . ”
39173	39233	39167	39167	She	357	“ I spent the past year getting divorced after four years of being married to a complete stick in the mud , and two years before that dating him , and I ’m trying so hard to remember who I was before him , but there are still a few things that scare me or make me super uncomfortable . ”
39255	39264	39251	39251	I	0	“ And those other things would be … ? ”
39265	39280	39358	39358	She	1234	“ Paragliding , being squeezed to death by an anaconda , and lightning bugs . ”

39286	39357	39358	39358	She	1234	“ One flew up my nose and got caught in my sinus cavity when I was at a party I was n’t supposed to be at in high school , and you do not want to know what it took to get it out , which is really sad , because I have such great memories of chasing lightning bugs with Hyacinth at Dad ’s summer camp , but now ... ”
39373	39389	39358	39358	She	1234	“ Excuse me , Captain . Have you ever lost anyone on a dinner cruise ? ”

39477	39484	39474	39474	Begonia	127	“ Why does that sound familiar ? ”

39702	39730	39669	39669	Begonia	127	“ No , you have n’t thought of her as a potential girlfriend , or no , you do n’t think she ’s in love with you ? ”

He was coated in stage make - up that made him look approximately sixty - five for a fifty years later scene , and he wanted a cheeseburger from a local joint just outside the studio ’s gates .

40731	40803	40804	40804	I	0	“ No . We took off at a run , and we ended up thinking we ’d lost them when we dove into a single port - a - john at the edge of an alleyway , but teenage girls are terrifyingly smart , and they surrounded us , belting out the tunes from that god - awful film where he played a rock star until security arrived and rescued him . ”

You bought cheese from the clearance bin at the market this morning , and you promised Kristine we ’d use a dryer sheet when we wash this quilt before returning it to her tomorrow . When I say you would n’t understand , you have to trust that you truly could not possibly understand . It has nothing to do with your character or your intellect , and you ’ve done nothing wrong , but you can not understand . ”

Now . I choose her . I realize you think you have my best intentions at heart , and I have no doubt you mean no harm , but I get to decide what I want . Not you . Not society . Not some arcane system of rules . And if you ca n’t respect that , then perhaps you are n’t what ’s best for me either . ”

45155	45168	45202	45203	the devil	1401	“ Love is n’t rational , but it ’s not pathetic either . ”
45221	45229	45230	45230	She	1402	“ Do you know the worst part ? ”
45245	45256	45230	45230	She	1402	“ It bothers me that your story can get worse . ”
45257	45321	45322	45322	I	0	“ My mom did n’t understand . Does n’t understand . She thinks I should n’t have divorced him and that I should ask him to take me back because Begonia , he did n’t hit you , he provided for you , and he let you spend time with your friends . That ’s what my mom thinks a good relationship is . ”
45358	45373	45374	45374	I	0	“ And my mother wonders why I do n’t want to fall in love , ”
45377	45385	45374	45374	I	0	“ You would be good at it . ”
45386	45458	45459	45459	She	1403	“ I grew up watching my family get richer and richer off of fantastical and over - romanticized depictions of relationships while every woman I was ever attracted to ultimately proved to want nothing more than my money , my connections , or my family name . I would not be good at love , because I have no idea what real love , in the real world , looks like . ”
45507	45592	45461	45461	her	1403	“ Real love looks a lot like changing your plans at the last minute to humor someone having an irrational panic attack , and then defending said flake to your mother , because you know no one ’s perfect , but you ’re willing to accept them just as they are , flaws and all , knowing that they ’re doing their very best , every day , and wanting to help them along that journey every day for the rest of your life . ”
45612	45622	45623	45623	Begonia	147	“ I know you wo n’t ever love me , ”
45626	45720	45623	45623	Begonia	147	“ I know this is pretend and temporary and just one more adventure for me , and something convenient for you . But I just want you to know , you know the right things to do to love someone . It ’s not your fault if all of the women in the world are n’t willing to do the same for you . It ’s actually a damn shame , because you would be quite a catch for any woman willing to see you for the man hiding under all those walls . ”
45788	45798	45799	45799	I	0	“ You do n’t know who I truly am , ”
45803	45840	45799	45799	I	0	“ I do n’t . You ’re right . But I know enough . And I do n’t blame you for not believing me . I probably would n’t believe me either if I were you . ”
46681	46693	46694	46694	he	147	“ You keep saying you do n’t have cell signal here , ”
46697	46715	46694	46694	he	147	“ That was kind of the point of looking at this part of the country for vacation . ”
46734	46741	46694	46694	he	147	“ My mom ca n’t call . ”
46742	46751	46752	46752	He	147	“ But you miss talking to your sister . ”
46759	46773	46752	46752	He	147	“ You ’re on the wifi now . It ’ll carry a call . ”
46871	46882	46883	46883	he	147	“ Do n’t listen to the messages from your mother , ”
46886	46933	46883	46883	he	147	“ I would ’ve deleted them myself but your dog would n’t let me . Her emails too . Why the fuck is she still asking if you want to get back together with your ex - husband when she clearly knows you ’re dating me ? ”
47018	47066	47067	47067	Hayes	104	“ If you hit that button , I will throw that thing into the ocean , your dog ’s opinion be damned . She does n’t believe you can keep me , and she thinks you need to cut your losses before you piss him off more . ”
47266	47288	47289	47289	I	0	“ I ’m calling my sister and I ’m telling her you still have a few things to learn in bed , ”
47300	47307	47308	47308	I	0	“ I ’d expect nothing less . ”
47852	47855	47856	47856	I	0	“ Hey , ”
47889	47903	47904	47904	She	127	“ Oh my god , Begonia , you are a fucking ROCK STAR ! ”
47911	47947	47904	47904	She	127	“ No , Jerry , I wo n’t watch my language in front of the kids when my sister is dating a fucking billionaire . This is appropriate usage of the word fuck , okay ? ”
47948	47953	47954	47954	I	0	“ Hey , Jerry , ”
47959	47964	47965	47965	she	127	“ B says hey , ”
47975	48001	47969	47969	she	127	“ Talk . Now . Fast . Before Mom figures out we ’re talking and tries to beep in . She is losing her mind . ”
48002	48010	48017	48017	She	127	“ So this thing just kinda happened . ”
48048	48135	48188	48188	she	1487	“ And I met his mom . And we ’re going to New York tomorrow . And you ca n’t tell the news that if they call , okay ? It ’s actually possibly scandalous that we ’re dating so soon after my divorce ? I do n’t know that part for sure , but it ’s like , the Rutherford family . Frowning wrong at a camera is scandalous , right ? And apparently there are security considerations with travel plans , blah blah blah . ”
48136	48167	47969	47969	she	127	“ Gossip Minute just posted a picture of you from dinner tonight and it looks like you ’re giving him the Heimlich . All I can say is , what ? ”
48168	48183	48184	48184	Her	1487	“ I told him the clay giraffe story while he was eating clam chowder . ”
48206	48228	48188	48188	she	1487	“ Begonia . You ca n’t keep the world ’s last billionaire bachelor interested if you ’re trying to kill him ! ”
48229	48413	47969	47969	she	127	“ Hy . He survived . And you ca n’t tell me any of his other options for dinner companions would ’ve been nearly as entertaining . He ’s never dated a commoner before . Wait . No , he has , but none quite like me . He thinks the fact that I use drug store shampoo is adorable . Confounding , but adorable . Also , oh my god , he has this hundred - dollar - an - ounce hand cream from this spa called Silver Crocus , which is just the best name ever — wait , excuse me , it ’s Silver Crocus hand crème , spelled with that funky symbol over the first e , and I keep calling it cremm - aye just to watch him stare at me like I ’m one of those poison frogs that supposedly just went extinct , and yet he found me in the wild . Like , shocked and worried but still enthralled and like he ca n’t believe the very last poison frog in the world is his ? ”
48414	48423	48500	48500	she	1488	“ Only you , Begonia . Only you . ”
48424	48475	47969	47969	she	127	“ I do n’t have any expectations that this is forever — I mean , who marries their first boyfriend post - divorce ? Other than Mom , who loves being married?—so I ’m going to enjoy the thrill of the ride while I ’m on it , you know ? ”
48476	48487	48488	48488	she	1488	“ Is it … thrilling … in all the ways ? ”
48548	48572	48573	48573	Her	1488	“ The first time he kissed me , it was like , oh my god , is this what I ’ve been missing ? ”
48598	48610	48578	48578	she	1488	“ Shh ! I do n’t want to talk about it . ”
48664	48685	48647	48647	I	0	“ It ’s like … sometimes you just want to enjoy something without analyzing it too much , you know ? ”
48686	48694	48647	48647	I	0	“ Analyzing is most of the fun . ”
48695	48706	48707	48707	She	1488	“ Do I need to talk to Jerry about that ? ”
48823	48828	48829	48829	she	127	“ Enough about Jerry , ”
48890	48988	48989	48989	She	1497	“ Have you met Jonas yet ? Oh my god , I ’d probably ask if I could lick him if I ever met him . Yes , Jerry , you knew that when you married me . Hush . He ’s on my freebie list , not that it matters , because he ’s a Rutherford , and he ’s married now , which means he wo n’t let fans lick him anymore . Not that he ever did . But you can rest assured you ’re the last man I ’ll ever lick , okay ? ”
49012	49033	48991	48991	her	1497	“ Do you think he ’d let me lick him if we were in a dark room with no witnesses ? ”
49034	49039	48991	48991	her	1497	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
49040	49052	48991	48991	her	1497	“ Is Hayes as weird as the news says he is ? ”
49053	49108	48991	48991	her	1497	“ No . They just like to have something salacious to report , and he does n’t fit the mold is as juicy as it gets , which makes him an easier target than the rest of the family . He ’s such a nice guy , Hy . And — cone of silence ? ”
49109	49135	48991	48991	her	1497	“ I wo n’t say a word , unless it ’s to Mom , and only under extreme duress if it ’ll improve the situation . ”
49136	49152	49153	49154	My sister	3241	“ His mom does n’t like me , but he told her off for me . ”
49157	49167	49153	49154	My sister	3241	“ What the fuck ’s wrong with his mom ? ”
49168	49239	49240	49240	I	0	“ Oh , do n’t be like that . I ’m a suburban art teacher who ’s recently divorced , ca n’t cook , and does n’t know which fork to use during a seven - course meal , and he ’s the world ’s last eligible male billionaire . Of course she ’s concerned . I would be if I were her . And did you see my hair ? ”
49283	49370	49278	49278	Hyacinth	127	“ His mother needs to know you ’re a fucking catch . Shut up , Jerry ! If you do n’t like my language , take the kids outside and play a damn game with them ! Sorry , B. He ’s taking the kids out now . As I was saying . His mother ’s had an awful lapse in judgment , and I ’m sure she ’ll see the error of her ways soon . So long as you do n’t cook for her . ”
49374	49383	49278	49278	Hyacinth	127	“ Begonia . Tell me you did n’t . ”
49384	49443	49486	49486	I	0	“ I did n’t know I was meeting her and I got nervous and stayed nervous for the entire time she was here ! But it wo n’t happen again . At least Marshmallow did n’t do anything crazy like find a vibrator in her luggage and deliver it to my room . That would ’ve been awkward . ”
49573	49675	49569	49569	I	0	“ You should see this estate , Hy . It ’s on the southern tip of the island , so we can see both the sunrise and the sunset from the gardens , and Hayes rowed himself out here in a rowboat to get to me the day after Jonas ’s wedding , because he did n’t want to wait for a ferry , and that ’s hot . Here . Let me remember how to flip my camera , and I ’ll show you the sky here . The sunset is so gorgeous tonight . Pinks and blues and purples … ”
49704	49719	49680	49680	I	0	“ Tell me you do n’t have Giovanna Rutherford ’s vibrator in your possession . ”
49720	49793	49871	49871	her	1503	“ No . It ’s back in the nightstand drawer in the guest bedroom , and you are not welcome here until it ’s reunited with its owner , and do you know what else ? Good for her . Now , can we please discuss how my boyfriend has the most delicious chest known to man ? You think Jonas is hot . You should see Hayes without his shirt on . ”
49794	49799	49871	49871	her	1503	“ Hair or no ? ”
49800	49830	49871	49871	her	1503	“ Yes . And it ’s like , not just a token amount of hair , but it ’s also not like a rug . It ’s just right . ”
49831	49837	49871	49871	her	1503	“ Are his nipples even ? ”
49838	49868	49869	49869	She	1503	“ Will you never quit mocking my poor high school boyfriend and his crooked nipples ? That ’s how his body was made , Hy . Knock it off . ”
49874	49879	49869	49869	She	1503	“ And his … ? ”
49880	49913	49871	49871	her	1503	“ Sorry , I actually had to sign a non - disclosure agreement about that part . It comes with dating a billionaire from the country ’s most famous family , apparently . ”
49914	49919	49871	49871	her	1503	“ You did n’t . ”
49920	49970	49869	49869	She	1503	“ I did . And if I had a little more money in my vacation fund , I might ’ve hired my own attorney and asked him to sign one in return , agreeing to never mock my art or my cooking in the event that we break up . ”
49971	50010	50011	50011	I	0	“ Oh my god , Begonia . Only you . Fine . Tell me he ’s at least treating you to the rarest oysters and albino lobster and gold - crusted chocolates that will make your poop glitter . ”
50014	50101	50102	50102	She	1504	“ No , but I think he would if I asked . But I do n’t want the fancy stuff . I like just having lunch or dinner with him out at the cute little local places with all the funny people who tell stories about the times they ’ve spotted him out here , or what they do in winter , or that time that a carton of lobsters spilled at the grocery store and they kept finding them in random places under the shelves . ”
50105	50128	50102	50102	She	1504	“ And once again , only you . Are you really just hiding out in Maine with him for the next forever ? ”
50129	50147	50148	50148	She	1504	“ No , he ’s taking me to Paris next weekend to see Monet ’s water lilies . ”
50151	50160	50148	50148	She	1504	“ But you were saving up for that . ”
50167	50178	50161	50161	I	0	“ I ’ll find another dream to save up for . “
50211	50212	50198	50198	you	0	” “
50215	50216	50198	50198	you	0	” “
50280	50281	50275	50275	I	0	” “
50286	50342	50275	50275	I	0	” Hayes says behind me , startling me so badly that I drop the phone . When I recover it , all I can see is Hyacinth ’s textured ceiling , suggesting that she , too , has dropped her phone . Her face pops back into view , eyes wide , mouth gaping open . “
50351	50352	50349	50349	you	0	” “
50358	50387	50349	50349	you	0	” He sets a steaming mug on a small picnic table tucked in amongst the wildflowers , then drapes an arm around my shoulders and kisses my temple . “
50425	50442	50443	50443	You	127	” He lifts a hand and waves to my sister , then disappears behind me again . “
50449	50453	50454	50454	You	127	” Hyacinth whispers . “
50459	50464	50454	50454	You	127	” I whisper back . “
50488	50579	50454	50454	You	127	” I nod , even though there will be no bone - jumping . Him moving into the other bedroom made that very clear . I manage to get off the phone without Hyacinth catching on that this is all just for show . But I ’m starting to wish my heart would remember that part . He made me tea . Chad never made me tea . And Hayes Rutherford is n’t my soulmate . But he ’s doing a damn good job of resetting my standards in the meantime .
50649	50657	50658	50658	Begonia	127	“ Where ’s the Empire State Building ? ”
50679	50687	50660	50660	her	127	“ Are we facing the wrong way ? ”
50717	50747	50748	50748	I	0	“ Razzle Dazzle ’s corporate offices moved out of Manhattan several years back in an effort to give our employees more space for their families to live and play , ”
50778	50798	50755	50755	Marshmallow	108	“ Because they did n’t want to live in the city , or because it ’s all about appearances ? ”
50799	50802	50803	50803	I	0	“ Yes . ”
50810	50841	50803	50803	I	0	“ And it also significantly reduced the burden of real estate upkeep costs . I have to get straight to the offices . Nikolay will escort you to Sagewood House . ”
50842	50865	50755	50755	Marshmallow	108	“ Can we detour somewhere fun in Albany , or do I have to go straight there to drop off my luggage ? ”
50866	50907	50908	50908	Her	1519	“ Correction . Nikolay will see to it that your bags are delivered to Sagewood House , where I will meet you this evening , and he ’ll accompany you anywhere you ’d like to go between now and then . ”
50916	50923	50908	50908	Her	1519	“ Can I see your offices ? ”
50924	50953	50954	50954	I	0	“ You ’d be bored to tears amidst the gray walls and suits , my dear bluebell . Go explore the art exhibits and museums by the river . ”
50959	50972	50954	50954	I	0	“ Make sure the staff is aware that Marshmallow needs extra supervision . ”
50979	50984	50973	50974	The man	363	“ Naturally , sir . ”
51085	51112	51066	51066	I	0	“ My uncle is also in residence at Sagewood House , so we ’ll be sharing a bedroom again . Until tonight , my dear bluebell . ”
51173	51254	51155	51155	her	198	“ Good morning , Mr. Rutherford . How do you like your coffee ? I ’ll text ahead and have it waiting . Your nine - thirty has been rescheduled to six , your mother made a reservation at The Brunch Café for you at one , we ’ve combed through the applicants for your own executive assistant as requested and scheduled interviews for you starting at two , and Mr. Okimoto requires a word as soon as we arrive . ”
51255	51311	51312	51312	She	1526	“ Cancel the six o’clock , cancel lunch with my mother , forward me the candidates ’ resumes , and call my uncle Antonio and inform him he ’s moving into Sagewood House for the next two weeks . Also , tell anyone you ’re talking to Antonio , and I ’ll have you fired . ”
51368	51379	51350	51350	She	1526	“ Of course , Mr. Rutherford . And your coffee ? ”
51380	51393	51350	51350	She	1526	“ I do n’t know . Call my girlfriend and ask her . ”
51394	51402	51403	51403	I	0	“ Her phone number , Mr. Rutherford ? ”
51472	51483	51449	51449	Robert	200	“ Got it right here for you , Ms. Therese . ”
51484	51490	51491	51491	I	0	“ Thank you , Robert . ”
52019	52027	52028	52028	She	198	“ Did you schedule the interviews simultaneously ? ”
52040	52062	52028	52028	She	198	“ Of course not , Mr. Rutherford . But we did stress to all of the applicants that timeliness is important . ”
52114	52117	52102	52102	I	0	“ Hello ? ”
52118	52124	52102	52102	I	0	“ Begonia . I need — ”
52125	52173	52102	52102	I	0	“ Hayes ! Hi , sweetie . Did you know downtown Albany has a performing arts center called The Egg ? It ’s amazing . And Nikolay said the right thing to the right person and we got this unbelievable behind - the - scenes tour that — ”
52174	52179	52180	52180	I	0	“ You know people , ”
52183	52192	52180	52180	I	0	“ Quite a few of them , yes . ”
52193	52211	52215	52215	her	1575	“ Good . Come here . Now . I need someone to interview executive assistants for me . ”
52218	52231	52232	52232	she	1575	“ Can I — can I speak freely in front of Nikolay ? ”
52235	52238	52239	52239	She	1575	“ No . ”

52263	52303	52260	52260	I	0	“ That ’s me breathing very deeply before I do n’t remind you that people like you do n’t call people like me to do the things that you have other way more qualified people to do for you . ”
52304	52311	52313	52313	me	0	“ I do n’t trust them . ”
52440	52447	52448	52448	I	0	“ I do n’t understand people , ”
52452	52624	52448	52448	I	0	“ I do n’t know if my temporary executive assistant is hitting on me or trying to annoy me , and I do n’t know why everyone thinks getting married is some pinnacle event to be celebrated when it looks like shackles and chains to me . I know numbers . I was born and raised to be if not in this exact position for Razzle Dazzle , then damn close to it , and I know I ca n’t do my job without help , but I do n’t know how to find the help , but you — you knock on doors and ask people for food not because we ca n’t afford it , but because you somehow know it would actually make other people happy to help . You know why people tick . You could probably tell me what Nikolay wants for Christmas , who his last girlfriend was , why they broke up , and if he has a favorite sports team , but I — ”
52625	52673	52674	52674	she	1585	“ A ride in a hot air balloon , Sheila with the shoe collection , she did n’t like his hours , and the Copper Valley Thrusters , because he likes their mascot , just like me , but he said it first , for the record , ”
52758	52822	52744	52744	they	1588	“ Will you please come interview these hundred women who want to be my executive assistant ? I ’ll buy you diamonds and pearls and cancel Paris and take you somewhere else instead , and order you golden chocolates so that you can — I wo n’t finish that sentence , but I did listen to every word your sister said about it . ”
52823	52842	52906	52906	she	1592	“ Hayes , you do n’t have to buy me gifts for me to do the little things . ”
52843	52851	52852	52852	I	0	“ This is not a little thing . ”
52899	52905	52906	52906	she	1592	“ Have you had lunch ? ”

52939	52962	52906	52906	she	1592	“ Your job applicants are n’t going anywhere if they ’re worthy of working for you , Hayes . Where are you ? ”
52963	52969	52906	52906	she	1592	“ Locked in my office . ”
52970	53032	53110	53110	She	1593	“ Good . Stay there . I ’ll be there in twenty — no , Nikolay says ten minutes , but we have to stop to get you a lunch that ’ll taste good enough for you to remember it , so definitely twenty minutes , and then I ’ll handle everything . Also , can I tell Hyacinth about this ? ”
53033	53036	52906	52906	she	1592	“ No . ”
53037	53106	53107	53107	I	0	“ Good gravy , I ’ll leave out the part where you look human and vulnerable , okay ? You ’re really , really great at a lot of things , but asking you to interview a hundred women on your first day back in the office after a death in your family sounds like something your mother would dream up in a really bad Razzle Dazzle film . ”
53129	53136	53137	53137	Begonia	127	“ Do not call your mother , ”
53140	53144	53137	53137	Begonia	127	“ Let me . ”
53207	53210	53200	53200	I	0	“ Begonia . ”

53232	53243	53248	53248	they	1598	“ Someone hurt you very badly , did n’t they ? ”
53251	53281	53248	53248	they	1598	“ Tell Nikolay to bring you here and then run out for whatever else it is you ’re convinced I need . I ’ll see you in ten minutes . ”
53329	53339	53340	53340	he	104	“ Mr. Rutherford is not a fan of pizza , ”
53344	53412	53340	53340	he	104	“ Then where ’s the best fried chicken in town ? He needs something orgasmic . Coconut cream pie . No , too many people do n’t like coconut and we have n’t had that discussion yet . A fudge brownie sundae and fried chicken and biscuits . Biscuits . We definitely need biscuits . I ’ve tried everything else . It ’s time for comfort food . ”
53413	53423	53424	53424	My	0	“ This way to the limo , Ms. Begonia . ”
53475	53486	53468	53469	my mother	357	“ Hello ? Begonia ? Begonia , are you there ? ”
53611	53616	53604	53609	the woman I ’ve been avoiding	1605	“ Hello , Mom . ”
53617	53628	53588	53591	a grown - up	1604	“ You ’re dating the world ’s last eligible billionaire ! ”
53629	53673	53674	53674	Nikolay	197	“ No , Mom , we ’re having a torrid fling and I ’m on my way to have loud , noisy , earth - shattering sex with him in public in a park just to horrify people , and then I ’ll — ”
53852	53859	53860	53860	I	0	“ I ’m kidding , Mom , ”
53864	53873	53860	53860	I	0	“ Of course we wo n’t do that . ”
53964	53970	53971	53971	Mom	137	“ Are you getting married ? ”
53974	53989	53990	53990	Nikolay	197	“ Is this a rebound thing , or is this a potential forever thing ? ”
54005	54033	53999	53999	I	0	“ It ’s a one - day - at - a - time thing with a guy who stuck up for me when his mother insulted me . ”
54040	54072	54034	54034	She	137	“ His mother ? Giovanna Rutherford ? You met his mother ? And she did n’t like you either ? Dear god , Begonia , what did you do to her ? ”
54073	54080	53990	53990	Nikolay	197	“ I breathed wrong , Mom . ”
54081	54116	54034	54034	She	137	“ Begonia ! You ca n’t go around breathing wrong when you ’re dating a billionaire ! Especially around his mother ! What ’s she going to think about the way I raised you ? ”
54117	54153	54034	54034	She	137	“ I do n’t know . Maybe she ’ll think you raised me to date normal men , since that would make more sense for where we lived and the social circles we move in ? ”
54186	54238	54180	54181	my mom	2982	“ Your father had some very exclusive clients at his summer camp a time or two . There was a Norwegian prince one year , and the son of an oil baron another year . We should ’ve made sure you spent more time with them to learn rich people manners . ”
54239	54250	54180	54181	my mom	2982	“ Was n’t that before Hyacinth and I were born ? ”
54251	54280	54180	54181	my mom	2982	“ Do n’t bother me with details , Begonia . The point is , you have a very rare opportunity , and you need to not waste it . ”
54281	54325	54326	54326	My	0	“ Marshmallow ! Oh , no ! Silly doggy ! How could you spill that strawberry daiquiri all over the inside of this priceless limo ! Mom , I have to go . Marshmallow and I are in trouble with the billionaires again . ”
54355	54363	54348	54348	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry , baby . ”
54399	54453	54454	54454	Nikolay	197	“ I promise I ’ll buy you six new chew toys and a big fluffy bed with my next paycheck . You know she ’ll forgive you , but I would ’ve never heard the end of it if I told her I was the one who stained the inside of a limo . ”
54462	54506	54459	54459	I	0	“ She wanted me to stay married to a man I did n’t love because she does n’t think I can take care of myself . She means well , she just … wants different things for me than I want for myself . ”
54507	54513	54514	54514	Dammit	204	“ What do you want ? ”
54525	54535	54536	54536	He	197	“ For someone to love me just for me . ”
54540	54553	54536	54536	He	197	“ I hope a penis grows out of your mother ’s forehead . ”
54554	54559	54560	54560	I	0	“ She means well , ”
54564	54588	54560	54560	I	0	“ If she meant well for you , she ’d pay attention to what you want . Not what she wants for you . ”
54622	54637	54638	54638	Nikolay	197	“ It looks like a little village ! Like from one of the movies ! ”
54641	54654	54638	54638	Nikolay	197	“ Mr. Rutherford believes people work best when they feel at home . ”
54655	54661	54749	54749	I	0	“ Mr. Rutherford — Hayes ? ”
54662	54674	54638	54638	Nikolay	197	“ No , ma’am — his father . Mr. Gregory Rutherford . ”
54675	54691	54638	54638	Nikolay	197	“ Why does Hayes hate it ? He told me it was dull and boring . ”
54692	54708	54638	54638	Nikolay	197	“ What one learns to appreciate depends on what one is surrounded with , ma’am . ”
54782	54786	54787	54787	I	0	“ City Hall ? ”
54793	54799	54790	54790	Nikolay	197	“ And the executive offices . ”
54800	54806	54790	54790	Nikolay	197	“ Hayes way undersold this . ”
55101	55104	55094	55094	he	104	“ Begonia . ”
55105	55108	55094	55094	he	104	“ Hayes . ”
55158	55173	55174	55174	he	104	“ Everyone will be watching us closely , so be on your best behavior , ”
55177	55191	55174	55174	he	104	“ I did n’t think you were dating me for my best behavior , ”
55196	55234	55174	55174	he	104	“ I meant your best pretending to be madly in love behavior . And for god ’s sake , please weed through the disaster in my lobby . Diamonds and pearls , Begonia . Diamonds and pearls . ”
55235	55261	55262	55262	He	104	“ I do n’t want diamonds and pearls , but I ’d take a day pass to Razzle Dazzle Village for Hyacinth and her kids . ”
55280	55291	55292	55292	I	0	“ We need to work on your standards and expectations . ”
55304	55319	55295	55295	I	0	“ Is it too much ? I ’m taking advantage , are n’t I ? ”
55320	55343	55344	55344	Marshmallow	108	“ Yes , Begonia . Giving away three single - day passes to Razzle Dazzle Village would completely bankrupt the entire operation . ”
55351	55356	55344	55344	Marshmallow	108	“ Agreed , Marshmallow . ”
55362	55414	55357	55357	I	0	“ Sarcasm still is n’t all that attractive on Hayes . It ’s a good thing he has other redeeming qualities . And Hyacinth has two kids and a husband who should probably go with her if we want Hyacinth to have a good time . So four passes , please . ”
55415	55443	55344	55344	Marshmallow	108	“ Find me an executive assistant , and she ’ll book the whole damn family a week - long private adventure with all the frills and fripperies . ”
55444	55460	55461	55461	I	0	“ Oh , that ’s too mu — um , I mean , thank you . ”
55464	55473	55461	55461	I	0	“ Also , can you say fripperies again ? ”
55474	55477	55344	55344	Marshmallow	108	“ No . ”
55478	55495	55496	55496	He	108	“ Please ? It was adorable . In a manly , rugged way , I mean . ”
55616	55626	55627	55627	I	0	“ Did you take your allergy medicine this morning ? ”
55646	55657	55658	55658	I	0	“ Is it the job , or is it me ? ”
55711	55714	55715	55715	I	0	“ Whoa , ”
55718	55733	55715	55715	I	0	“ I ’ll be in my office . Tell me when you ’re done . ”
55792	55795	55796	55796	I	0	“ Hayes , ”
55841	55853	55799	55799	His	104	“ Please do n’t tell me you ca n’t do this . ”
55854	55869	55907	55907	he	104	“ I need a kiss for good luck . And to stake my claim . ”
55870	55884	55922	55922	he	104	“ That ’s not proper , Begonia . I ’m still a Rutherford . ”
55885	55893	55894	55894	He	104	“ It ’s necessary for my process . ”
55930	55975	55922	55922	he	104	“ This is Begonia . She ’s my girlfriend . We ’re madly in love , and she ’ll be doing the pre - interview screenings . Anyone who disrespects her will immediately be dismissed from consideration for the job . Am I clear ? ”
55988	55994	55995	55995	I	0	“ That was less helpful , ”
56000	56010	55995	55995	I	0	“ I have faith in you , my bluebell . ”
56066	56077	56078	56078	Nikolay	197	“ Just point , and I ’ll escort them out , ”
56083	56103	56078	56078	Nikolay	197	“ I ca n’t really tell someone they ca n’t have a job just because I ’m feeling jealous . ”
56104	56109	56110	56110	he	104	“ You know people , ”
56113	56155	56110	56110	he	104	“ Point . Do not feel bad . It ’s now , or it ’s several inappropriate passes at work later . This world is cutthroat , Begonia . Consider what Mr. Rutherford needs , and I ’ll handle the rest . ”
56160	56167	56168	56168	I	0	“ She definitely has to go , ”
56209	56236	56191	56191	he	104	“ She ’s not interviewing , Ms. Begonia . Therese is already an executive assistant here , merely filling in until Mr. Rutherford hires his own . ”
56279	56309	56310	56310	He	104	“ Alright , ladies , let ’s do this in an orderly fashion . If anyone has to use the restroom , it’s — Nikolay , where is it ? ”
56319	56324	56325	56325	I	0	“ It ’s there , ”
56334	56483	56325	56325	I	0	“ Do n’t be shy about taking care of your own needs , because you ca n’t take care of Mr. Rutherford if you do n’t take care of yourself first . If anyone ca n’t handle taking care of herself first , no one will judge you if you quietly see yourself out , and I wish you all the best . This world really does n’t teach us to take care of ourselves , does it ? But can you imagine if we — erm , sorry . Right . Interviews . I want you all to line up shortest to tallest , leave your shoes on , yes , and we ’ll get started in height order for the first few interviews before I mix things up again , because that ’s completely random and nothing any of you have any control over . Questions ? ”
56508	56518	56505	56505	his	197	“ You heard Ms. Fairchild . Please line up . ”
56843	56847	56848	56848	I	0	“ Go away , ”
56884	56892	56893	56893	She	1683	“ Your executive assistants , my lord . ”
56938	56941	56942	56942	I	0	“ Assistant , ”
56945	56948	56942	56942	I	0	“ Singular . ”
56949	57099	57100	57100	She	1690	“ Assistants . Plural . Two . Because it ’s utterly ridiculous to think that one woman can do everything from fixing your coffee to booking your travel to handling your dry cleaning to managing your complete calendar when managing your calendar alone is a full - time job , and do not get me started on the last time Therese took a vacation since there ’s no one to cover for her and she still has to go do work for her other VP when you leave for the day , and yes , I did go to the pub around the corner and tell them to charge you for her lunch , dinner , and all snacks for the next week . If you do n’t start valuing the work of the people who make your life run , we are done , Hayes Rutherford . Done . ”
57125	57190	57102	57102	her	1690	“ And do not put up with any insistence that either of you work more than forty hours a week . If he has to drop off his dry cleaning on his own , or hire a personal assistant outside of your working hours to tend to his coffee and make his dental appointments , then that ’s what he ’ll have to do . ”
57191	57194	57195	57195	She	1690	“ Begonia — ”
57201	57211	57195	57195	She	1690	“ Happy employees are productive employees . Fight me . ”
57282	57291	57292	57292	I	0	“ We can fight later , my love . ”
57338	57382	57383	57383	Begonia	187	“ Ladies . Pleasure to meet you both . I ’m sure you ’ll find me cranky and difficult and say horrible things about me behind my back , and I honestly do n’t care , so long as my office runs smoothly . ”
57395	57403	57385	57385	her	187	“ I ’m being honest , bluebell . ”
57404	57417	57418	57418	My	0	“ Names , Hayes . You have n’t even asked their names . ”
57446	57462	57439	57439	I	0	“ Apologies , ladies . This is quite the awkward start , is n’t it ? ”
57527	57571	57572	57572	She	187	“ Stop making that face . No one ’s questioning your authority , and you do n’t have to fire anyone . Technically , you have n’t even hired them yet , but I might break up with you if you do n’t . ”
57584	57611	57614	57614	she	187	“ Merriweather has six older brothers and can handle your attitude and wo n’t blink at strange requests , because she ’s already seen them all . ”
57634	57699	57614	57614	she	187	“ Winnie color - coded and reorganized your calendar faster than Therese could on the twenty - fourth time I made her race a candidate , and Therese does not like to lose , so she was n’t just playing to get out of helping me . Be yourself , Hayes . That ’s why I picked them . So you could be yourself . ”
57700	57711	57712	57712	Merriweather	208	“ That lets us be ourselves too , Mr. Rutherford , ”
57715	57735	57736	57736	Winnie	112	“ I quit my last job because my boss could n’t handle me pointing out errors in his spreadsheets , ”
57739	57787	57736	57736	Winnie	112	“ Begonia assures me your ego can handle it . If she ’s wrong , Merriweather will have to handle you solo , and I like her . I do n’t want to have to leave her and make her deal with you all on her own . ”
57788	57796	57797	57797	I	0	“ You ’re competent with finding errors ? ”
57800	57808	57797	57797	I	0	“ Databases , spreadsheets , balance sheets ? ”
57809	57834	57835	57835	I	0	“ The day artificial intelligence takes over and I can date a computer , my life will be complete . I live for logic . ”
57884	58001	57881	57881	Begonia	187	“ Therese scheduled you all for a getting - to - know - you breakfast at eight tomorrow morning at that adorable brunch café behind City Hall so you can verify for yourself that I ’m right and they ’re perfect and make everything official . But it ’s past my dinnertime , and past my dog ’s dinnertime , and I get ugly when I ’m hangry , and Marshmallow — well , you know what Marshmallow does even when he ’s not overdue for dinner . Also , please ignore anything anyone tells you about an incident with an umbrella and a coffee mug , and yes , it ’s worse than it sounds . ”
58011	58037	58005	58005	I	0	“ Ever seeing you angry in any manner would be quite the sight . Merriweather , Winnie , I look forward to working with you . ”
58038	58052	58053	58053	She	187	“ Good job . Now , take me home . I ’m famished . ”
58128	58133	58134	58134	she	187	“ Good luck tomorrow , ”
58229	58269	58208	58208	she	187	“ That was like doing an entire week of first days of the school year at once . And do n’t you dare consider not hiring both of them . You will love them . I have a feeling . ”
58283	58319	58279	58279	her	198	“ Winnie ’s former employer says she ’s difficult and he would n’t hire her back if she was the only person who could save him from being drowned in a burning barrel of oil . ”
58333	58352	58353	58353	Therese	198	“ He ’s the dickhead from the Brouchard Corporation that all of my friends have warned me about , ”
58356	58447	58353	58353	Therese	198	“ If you do n’t hire her , I ’ll quit , and if I quit , this entire company will fall apart . I was humoring you when you threatened to fire me this morning because I thought it might be worth the divorce settlement to stay on your good side in the event that you broke up with Begonia , but honestly , I hope she breaks up with you for herself . You ’re difficult . She deserves better , and I do n’t want you anymore . ”
58457	58469	58448	58448	Begonia	187	“ Be that tiger , Therese . You tell ’ i m. ”
58470	58529	58353	58353	Therese	198	“ Also , it turns out the real reason there were fifty women in your office is that there was a glitch , and all of the candidates that HR had rejected received emails telling them to show up at the same time . There are four more qualified candidates if you ’d like to speak with them . ”
58530	58535	58536	58536	Begonia	187	“ Not just yet , ”
58575	58593	58569	58569	I	0	“ Thank you for your assistance , both of you . Begonia . Time to go home . ”

58650	58662	58638	58638	she	187	“ Helicopter ? Please tell me that ’s a billionaire joke . ”
58663	58679	58680	58680	She	187	“ Sagewood House is over an hour by car . We ’re taking the helicopter . ”
58697	58714	58692	58692	Therese	198	“ Only the best pilots for the Rutherfords , Begonia . You ’re in good hands . ”
58715	58723	58724	58724	Begonia	187	“ It ’s on my bucket list . ”
58743	58777	58778	58778	I	0	“ But over a glacier in Alaska or into the heart of a dormant volcano in Hawaii . You know , so I can die in paradise and not over upstate New York . ”
58800	58819	58778	58778	I	0	“ You keep saying you want adventure , bluebell , and then you keep being afraid of it . ”
58820	58859	58860	58860	I	0	“ It ’s not that I do n’t want to take a helicopter ride . I do . But I need mental preparation time to be in a small metal whirlybird of potential death , and my dog . ”
58891	58898	58887	58887	Nikolay	197	“ Bird ’s ready , sir . ”
58899	58944	58871	58871	Therese	198	“ Marshmallow can not get in a helicopter . You — you go on ahead without me . I ’ll take the limo . Or I ’ll stay in that adorable little inn around the corner and I ’ll see you in the morning . ”
58945	58966	59003	59003	her	1716	“ The inn is for show . It ’s office space behind the façade . Your dog will be fine . ”
58967	58979	59003	59003	her	1716	“ He ’ll open the door and leap to his death ! ”
59236	59242	59243	59243	Begonia	187	“ I had fun today , ”
59255	59314	59243	59243	Begonia	187	“ I ’m exhausted , and I ’ll probably sleep like the dead for about two days to recover , but it was fun . Not the part where I had to tell like fifty women that they probably were n’t right for the job , but the part where I got to meet so many fascinating people . ”

59903	60075	59876	59876	Nikolay	197	“ It ’s massive . It ’s not a house . It’s — is that a hotel ? And the lawn ! It ’s so green . I know , I know , grass is green , but it ’s like — it ’s like it glows . It ’s preening because it knows it ’s the proverbial red carpet for whatever celebrities and CEOs and royals can afford to stay there . And the fountain ! When I was little , Hyacinth and I would sometimes check this book out at the library all about the world ’s greatest fountains , and we used to tell each other we ’d live in gorgeous mansions with fountains in our driveways , but naturally , we did n’t . I do n’t think I ’d want to . Can you imagine the upkeep on a fountain ? And it ’s not like a fountain like that would ’ve fit at summer camp , and I wanted to live at summer camp more . ”

If Mildred makes me eat one more kale smoothie , I ’m divorcing her , and the only thing that ever works to get me off the hook is I do n’t want to make other people watch me drink that shit . ”

That is adorable . Or are we testing out the next Razzle Dazzle plotline ? Do you do that ? Play - act plotlines to see which ones the unsuspecting guests do n’t realize are plotlines ? ”

62782	62814	62817	62817	her	392	“ We know where this is going in the end , Hayes , and I ’m a patient woman , but only so patient , and you ’d best remember that , ”
62823	62826	62827	62827	Hayes	104	“ Quiet , ”
62830	62834	62827	62827	Hayes	104	“ For now . ”

63247	63263	63294	63294	someone	341	“ She is not my fiancée , despite what her mother would like to believe . ”

63644	63675	63617	63617	she	1819	“ That is not a simple cheese roll . Did the chef put magic in it ? Pixie dust ? Sprinkles of awesome ? How does it taste so good ? ”
63676	63682	63683	63683	I	0	“ Essence of magic mushrooms , ”

64241	64400	64230	64230	She	1819	“ Or Nikolay , I ’m sure . He ’s very nice for being such a terrifying - looking man . Are you ever alone ? Honestly ? Do you use other people ’s houses when you ’re in the area and want a comfortable place to crash but do n’t have your own nearby ? Is that a thing in your crowd ? Is that why this is your house but everyone else just seems to make themselves at home regardless of what you want ? Hyacinth and I would totally share vacation houses all over the world if we did n’t have to worry about paying the bills , but then , we share half a brain and we get along better than most families . I think . And really , we ’d share summer camps all over the world before we ’d share houses , because summer camp is way better than a house . ”
64401	64420	64421	64421	I	0	“ Real estate is complicated , and I did n’t realize Uncle Antonio would be throwing a party . ”
64569	64590	64591	64591	I	0	“ Why did you abandon your other plans to come interview fifty women for the position of my executive assistant ? ”
64608	64636	64637	64637	I	0	“ Because the idea of you calling your mother instead was horrifying . She would ’ve had you hitched to one of them by this time tonight . ”
64644	64651	64640	64640	She	127	“ Sorry . That was rude . ”
64652	64697	64698	64698	She	127	“ No , it was accurate . And I ’m not convinced it was an accidental glitch in the human resources system . Which is neither here nor there . It happened , and I still do n’t know why you took that on . ”
64750	64757	64758	64758	she	127	“ I like to help people , ”
64764	64769	64758	64758	she	127	“ You needed help . ”
64801	64819	64795	64797	the family physician	1842	“ A chief financial officer should also be able to handle interviews and sorting applicants by himself . ”
64820	64868	64874	64874	She	127	“ No , Hayes — the world does n’t work like that . I mean , it does , but it should n’t . You ’re not the CFO of Razzle Dazzle because you have good people skills . Your people skills are n’t all that great . ”
64869	64873	64874	64874	She	127	“ Thank you . ”
64892	64990	64874	64874	She	127	“ And that ’s totally fine . Not everyone is a people person , nor should they be . You ’re the CFO because you have other strengths . And you ca n’t shine at what you ’re best at if you ’re spending all of your time and putting all of your energy into the things that drain you . Like interviewing fifty applicants when you should ’ve been choosing among four already pre - screened for you . Chad had to interview new assistants all the time . Believe me , I know the process . ”
65004	65013	65014	65014	She	1845	“ Did you help him narrow his options ? ”
65017	65036	65014	65014	She	1845	“ Mr. Big - Shot Financial Planner asking his art teacher wife for help ? Um , no . ”
65084	65125	65014	65014	She	1845	“ While your ex - husband is clearly a twatwaffle , that ’s exactly the issue . Any other CFO would not have called in a woman he blackmailed into pretending to be his girlfriend to handle that mess either . ”
65126	65167	65168	65168	She	1846	“ You should say twatwaffle more often . It sounds so distinguished when you do it . Also , you ’re not any other CFO . You ’re you , and I ’m honored that you trusted me to help . ”
65181	65213	65174	65174	she	1846	“ It says a lot about your good judgment that you know when to ask for help , and a lot about your luck that I just happened to be there . ”
65214	65234	65235	65235	She	1846	“ I do n’t want to not be good at the things I ’m supposed to be good at . ”
65245	65334	65235	65235	She	1846	“ I ’ve been teaching high schoolers for about ten years . Every semester , out of all of my students , there are always a handful who walk in with the most amazing talent for painting , or drawing , or sculpting , or studying , but rarely do I see all of those skills together . No one has them all . They ’re not supposed to . I do n’t have all of those skills , either , and I do n’t expect myself to . ”
65340	65381	65337	65337	her	1846	“ Anymore . I used to think I could do it all , but I ’ve learned to be kind to myself and celebrate my gifts and the things in my control and accept the rest for what they are . ”
65382	65400	65414	65414	she	1846	“ I rather doubt I have enough of any of the right skills to do the job . ”
65426	65433	65414	65414	she	1846	“ Your family believes in you . ”
65434	65445	65414	65414	she	1846	“ They believe in what they want to believe in . ”
65446	65552	65414	65414	she	1846	“ You know , every semester , I also have a handful of students walk in and tell me they suck at art , and they ’re only there because they need an easy A. And every year , every last one of those kids walks out of my classroom at the end of the semester still believing they suck at art , but I have yet to find one who did n’t have a piece they ’d made that they were extraordinarily proud of , and several more that are amazing but that they judge too harshly because we ’re our own worst critics . ”
65553	65565	65414	65414	she	1846	“ They make good art because you ’re a good teacher . ”
65566	65620	65414	65414	she	1846	“ I ’m a terrible teacher . I ’m always late turning in grades , I make lesson plans last - minute , and I spend parent - teacher conferences gossiping about old Golden Girls episodes instead of talking about how Kelsey or Aiden got a C in drawing for lack of trying . ”
65621	65629	65414	65414	she	1846	“ You do n’t give C ’s . ”
65630	65741	65742	65742	I	0	“ Guilty . I ’m an easy A. All I ask for is effort . But I have given six B ’s , and it was all about attitude , and I made sure there was nothing going on at home or in their personal lives first , and I finally realized some people are just shits , which makes me sad , so I do n’t like to dwell on it . But you , Hayes , are not a shit . You ’re a good man who loves his family but wants them to not badger you to death about getting married . They should trust your instincts . ”
65853	65937	65851	65851	Begonia	147	“ There ’s nothing wrong with you , and whatever it is you think you ’ve failed at in the past , you did n’t fail . You experienced life . You ’ll do a great job as CFO , with great people supporting you , and if this is truly not what you ’re meant to do , or if it ’s not what you want to do , you ’ll figure that out and move on to what makes you happy . ”
65938	65943	65986	65986	her	1852	“ You believe that . ”
65944	65953	65851	65851	Begonia	147	“ I do . I believe in everyone . ”
65954	65975	65976	65976	I	0	“ But why ? And why do you drop everything to help people even when they do n’t deserve it ? ”
66076	66085	66086	66086	I	0	“ What do you get out of it ? ”
66089	66140	66086	66086	I	0	“ I know what I got out of today . I know what your students get out of an easy class , and even out of learning to enjoy some form of art . What do you , Begonia Fairchild , get out of doing so much for everyone else ? ”
66141	66144	66145	66145	she	1852	“ Joy , ”
66149	66167	66145	66145	she	1852	“ I get joy out of knowing I ’ve brightened the world by brightening someone ’s world . ”
66228	66235	66236	66236	She	1852	“ Who makes your world better ? ”
66267	66282	66262	66262	She	1852	“ I really do n’t like when you throw my weaknesses in my face . ”
66298	66310	66290	66290	me	0	“ Heaven forbid you have a taste of your own medicine . ”
66345	66376	66336	66336	She	1852	“ I can take my medicine just fine . But I ’m still working on the right dosage , and I might need to try a different kind of medicine . ”
66377	66382	66336	66336	She	1852	“ Are you tipsy ? ”
66383	66428	66336	66336	She	1852	“ No . I ’m just a little sleepy , and I ca n’t remember what my medicine is supposed to be , besides leaving Chad , which I did , and I ’m happier now , but I ’m still … missing something . ”
66451	66460	66336	66336	She	1852	“ At least you ’re looking for yourself . ”
66461	66489	66516	66516	she	1859	“ It ’s hard to balance getting enough for yourself when your default is to give to everyone else . Which you have so brutally reminded me . ”
66490	66495	66336	66336	She	1852	“ That was brutal ? ”
66496	66510	66336	66336	She	1852	“ It seared my soul , Hayes . Seared . My . Soul . ”
66542	66682	66539	66539	She	1859	“ I hate disappointing people , and I disappointed my therapist every time I told her that I ’d put someone else ’s needs above my own since they needed whatever more than I did . That ’s the real reason why I ’m not in therapy anymore . I failed . I mean , I did n’t . I was projecting . My therapist was n’t really disappointed in me . She was pretty good . But I felt like I failed . And I hate failing at making myself happy when I ’m an expert at making people happy except when it comes to me . I ’m a person . I should be able to make me happy too so that my friends do n’t have to do it for me . Is there more wine ? ”

73105	73134	73097	73098	a nemesis	1982	” I wait . She waits . Marshmallow strolls between us , looking back and forth , tongue hanging out , like he ’s watching a tennis match . “
73144	73165	73135	73135	You	0	” Keisha finally says . A statement . Not a question , though she ’s clearly having trouble believing it . “
73180	73235	73174	73174	Hayes	163	” My tongue trips , and I swear she sees through the lie , no matter how much I try to convince myself that I rented his house online without knowing it was n’t mine to rent is n’t a lie , and is technically the reason we met . So I push ahead . “
73251	73277	73278	73278	Brock	235	” Her nose wrinkles like she ’s calling me out , but she does n’t say anything out loud . About my lie , anyway . “
73456	73460	73451	73451	Brock	235	” I gasp . “
73543	73544	73545	73545	Your	0	” “
73550	73558	73545	73545	Your	0	” I whisper . She nods emphatically . “
73737	73742	73733	73733	I	0	” My heart hurts . “
73748	73749	73750	73750	I	0	” “
73895	73921	73888	73888	I	0	” A tear slips down my cheek . I try to swipe it away fast , so she wo n’t see , but another follows . “
73931	73935	73924	73924	I	0	” Keisha says . “
73951	73960	73945	73945	me	0	” She sticks her tongue out and shudders . “
73980	74004	73961	73961	I	0	” I whisper . Her face freezes mid - shudder , and when it moves again , she stares at me in horror . “
74021	74022	74007	74008	B. That	239	” “
74025	74026	74007	74008	B. That	239	” “
74037	74037	74031	74031	I	0	”
74969	75039	75040	75040	He	104	“ No , Dexter , if you want approval , you ’ll need to send it through the proper channels . I ’m not interested in acting as your shortcut . No . No . No . Do I need to say no once more ? Call my office and make an appointment if you want to discuss this further . We ’re done for now . Good night . ”
75159	75180	75156	75156	his	104	“ Begonia . Apologies . This afternoon turned into one crisis after another , and I lost track of time . ”
75506	75512	75513	75513	he	104	“ You must be famished , ”
75519	75611	75513	75513	he	104	“ I had some duck with your family . And it was only mildly awkward when Uncle Antonio started talking about a few women he knows that he could invite out here , and then when your mother asked if he was ready to date again to try to cover for him , and then when Keisha pretended she was whispering to me that they ’re all a - holes , when she was n’t actually whispering at all and everyone heard her . What about you ? Have you eaten ? ”
75612	75623	75634	75634	he	2060	“ We stock Razzle Dazzle treats in all the offices . ”
75624	75627	75631	75631	his	2060	“ Hayes . ”
75642	75659	75634	75634	he	2060	“ I ’m shocked , bluebell . You seem the type to embrace snacks for dinner . ”
75660	75674	75675	75675	He	2060	“ On vacation . Not when you ’re working fourteen - hour days . ”
75688	75695	75675	75675	He	2060	“ Apologies for your awful dinner . ”
75696	75780	75816	75816	he	108	“ That was actually just the soup course . Dinner itself was n’t all bad . Françoise and I made friends today , so she snuck a live cricket onto your mom ’s plate , and then Marshmallow tried to save her from the scary cricket and ended up running across the table and almost catching his fur and another tablecloth on fire . I think you should have a no - candles rule as long as Marshmallow and I are in residence . ”
75788	75801	75816	75816	he	108	“ Are you laughing or having serious regrets about bringing me here ? ”
75831	75836	75816	75816	he	108	“ I ’m laughing . ”
75857	75865	75816	75816	he	108	“ At me , or with me ? ”
75866	75885	75820	75820	he	108	“ Out of sheer regret that I missed the show . Is my mother packing her bags yet ? ”
75886	75904	75837	75837	He	104	“ She says she has to be in Los Angeles for a dinner for some foundation tomorrow . ”
75905	75915	75816	75816	he	108	“ Excellent . Did you make lovely art today ? ”
75916	75930	75931	75931	He	104	“ Shh . No more talking until you eat something good for you . ”
75984	75989	75990	75990	I	0	“ F - food , ”
75995	76003	75990	75990	I	0	“ I believe I ’d prefer sleep . ”
76004	76022	75947	75947	his	104	“ You need both . And I mean sleep in the real sense of the word sleep . ”
76023	76029	76030	76030	I	0	“ Is the bedroom fixed ? ”
76033	76088	76030	76030	I	0	“ No . Your housekeeper and Keisha had an argument over whether the table that was under the flaming tablecloth could be saved , and the chairs still smell like smoke and stale water , and apparently having a clay art room assembled in an hour is as far as your money went today . ”
76089	76092	76093	76093	He	104	“ Hm . ”
76158	76167	76168	76168	He	104	“ A - ha ! You are hungry . ”
76189	76195	76168	76168	He	104	“ Can you hold this ? ”
76196	76213	76219	76219	he	104	“ It ’s a little heavy , but yes , I think I can — erp ! ”
76246	76249	76241	76241	him	104	“ Hayes . ”
76250	76274	76275	76275	he	104	“ Robert , close the door behind us , and do n’t let anyone else leave this house if they want to live , ”
76281	76286	76275	76275	he	104	“ Yes , sir , ”
76292	76296	76287	76287	Robert	200	“ Thank you . ”
76297	76305	76306	76306	Hayes	104	“ Do n’t hurt yourself , sir . ”
76312	76318	76319	76319	I	0	“ Do n’t do that , ”
76354	76360	76348	76348	Chad	114	“ Do what , love ? ”
76361	76368	76323	76324	The man	363	“ Smile . Do not smile . ”
76369	76382	76383	76383	He	104	“ I had the most fascinating text messages all day long today . ”
76442	76452	76466	76466	he	104	“ I would n’t call our text messages fascinating . ”
76453	76460	76461	76461	he	104	“ Jonas is enjoying his honeymoon , ”
76493	76549	76466	76466	he	104	“ My mother also has opinions about an interior designer for renovating my bedroom suite . Uncle Antonio is sorry he thought Liliane would be a welcome guest . He tells me he helped set up your pottery wheel himself . And Keisha tells me she told you all of my deepest , darkest secrets . ”
76550	76559	76560	76560	I	0	“ She only did it because she cares , ”
76564	76576	76560	76560	I	0	“ Yes , clearly breaking trust is a sign of caring . ”
76577	76587	76588	76588	His	2074	“ Would you have told me about Brock Sturgis ? ”
76592	76604	76588	76588	His	2074	“ She truly did tell you everything , did n’t she ? ”
76605	76613	76560	76560	I	0	“ She did n’t go into detail . ”
76614	76617	76560	76560	I	0	“ Hm . ”
76618	76642	76588	76588	His	2074	“ I wo n’t repeat a thing . But I think I understand better why your mom hovers . Everyone worries about you . ”
76643	76653	76560	76560	I	0	“ I am not a frail flower , Begonia . ”
76654	76688	76560	76560	I	0	“ That ’s really funny , because technically , a begonia is kind of a frail flower , so it ’s like you ’re pointing out that I am when you ’re not . ”
76689	76708	76588	76588	His	2074	“ You are not a frail flower either . God help the person who mistakes you for one . ”
76709	76727	76560	76560	I	0	“ I know I ’m not , and I know you ’re not . You ’re just … ”
76728	76734	76560	76560	I	0	“ I ’m just … ? ”
76735	76777	76560	76560	I	0	“ Stuck in a world where you can either let it suck away your soul or be alone . And that ’s not fair . Or easy , I ’d guess . How does everyone else in your family do it ? ”
76778	76910	76588	76588	His	2074	“ They do n’t feel it as personally , I suppose . Did n’t have the magnitude of betrayal . Or they do n’t mind . Or they appreciate the luxuries enough that the trade - off is worth it . My father married well . And not in a money sense , but in a trust and true love sense . My parents were high school sweethearts , in fact , from a time before my mother understood what would be expected of her . He ’s never worried about her stabbing him in the back , nor has he had to . Uncle Antonio did n’t fare as well , but he ’s my mother ’s brother , so he ’s shielded from the expectations of being a Rutherford . ”
76911	76918	76919	76919	I	0	“ And he ’s a man , ”
76926	76945	76923	76923	Hayes	104	“ That does present another level of protection in the eyes of the world , does n’t it ? ”
76946	76954	76588	76588	His	2074	“ But you did n’t escape it . ”
76955	76986	76588	76588	His	2074	“ I did for a time , leaving the country to study abroad and ignoring the tabloids and letting my family handle any issues . Ignorance truly is bliss sometimes . ”
76987	76995	76923	76923	Hayes	104	“ Would you tell me what happened ? ”
76996	77001	76588	76588	His	2074	“ You want details ? ”
77002	77005	76588	76588	His	2074	“ Yes . ”
77060	77085	77051	77051	I	0	“ Begonia , this is too lovely of a night to ruin it with old memories that I refuse to let haunt me anymore . ”
77086	77121	77051	77051	I	0	“ So , you needed a fake girlfriend because you ’re perfectly fine and well - adjusted and have no lingering trust issues after your fiancée committed the ultimate betrayal like fifteen years ago ? ”
77122	77143	77051	77051	I	0	“ You ’re so very cruel , yet so very irresistible at the same time . However do you manage ? ”
77144	77154	77155	77155	I	0	“ I wo n’t hurt you , you know , ”
77158	77201	77155	77155	I	0	“ If you want to use me to learn to trust someone again , I ’m okay with that . And I realize that saying you can trust me is basically a red flag that means you probably should n’t , but — ”
77202	77205	77051	77051	I	0	“ Begonia . ”
77206	77209	77210	77210	He	2077	“ Yes ? ”
77288	77306	77270	77270	He	2077	“ Sit . Have dinner with me and tell me all the good that I missed today . ”
77307	77315	77316	77316	He	2077	“ You want to hear me talk . ”
77476	77488	77489	77489	I	0	“ Is this for you , or is it for me ? ”
77563	77586	77587	77588	This man	426	“ For both of us , I had hoped . You seem to enjoy picnics , and I … I enjoy you . ”
77650	77655	77656	77656	I	0	“ Is someone listening ? ”
77659	77670	77656	77656	I	0	“ Are there more camera people hiding in the woods ? ”
77678	77681	77675	77675	I	0	“ Oh . ”
77682	77687	77688	77688	He	2077	“ Begonia . No . ”
77693	77753	77688	77688	He	2077	“ The photographers on Oysterberry Bay — I apologize . I don’t — you are correct . I do n’t trust easily , and I thought it necessary . But here , we ’re alone . You have my word . This is not for the world . This is for me . And , I hope , you . ”
77761	77767	77768	77768	I	0	“ I enjoy you too , ”
77771	77781	77768	77768	I	0	“ You should n’t . I ’m very disagreeable . ”
77870	77873	77874	77874	I	0	“ Hayes , ”
77877	77895	77874	77874	I	0	“ I would very much like to make love to you under the moonlight , Ms. Fairchild . ”
77950	77956	77957	77957	he	2090	“ With my eyes open , ”
77979	77998	77957	77957	he	2090	“ fully aware that I ’m with you , with you fully aware that you ’re with me . ”
78048	78053	78054	78054	I	0	“ No fires tonight , ”
78066	78079	78057	78057	His	2090	“ On the contrary , I hope to set you on fire . ”
78167	78172	78149	78149	his	2090	“ Move , Marshmallow . ”
78179	78192	78193	78193	Hayes	104	“ I ’m going to do unspeakably filthy things to your mother , ”
78450	78466	78432	78432	He	2090	“ Just when I thought you could n’t possibly get any more attractive , bluebell … ”
78467	78478	78432	78432	He	2090	“ Want me to do the same to your pants ? ”
78479	78482	78432	78432	He	2090	“ Yes . ”
78483	78492	78432	78432	He	2090	“ Are you adding this to my bill ? ”
78493	78518	78519	78519	He	2090	“ Payable in sexual favors . Where is that sweet nipple I found yesterday ? I miss it . Ah . Here it is . ”
78635	78641	78618	78618	He	2090	“ Your fingers are exquisite . ”
78642	78664	78665	78665	He	2090	“ Your body is extis — etiquette — oh my god , I ca n’t talk when I ’m this horny . ”
78684	78690	78665	78665	He	2090	“ More practice , Begaaaaaaaaaaah … ”
78709	78714	78691	78691	I	0	“ You were saying ? ”

80214	80233	80204	80204	she	127	“ You may have another sample , but not until you tell me if you ’ve ever camped . ”
80234	80238	80204	80204	she	127	“ Like this ? ”
80239	80281	80204	80204	she	127	“ No , like in a tent in the woods , roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over the fire and telling ghost stories until you ca n’t sleep because every raccoon or squirrel sounds like the claw coming to get you . ”
80282	80286	80287	80287	She	127	“ Not recently . ”

80465	80493	80502	80502	She	2111	“ We did ! And we made candles and tie - dyed T - shirts and that ’s the first place I ever used a pottery wheel . ”
80494	80501	80502	80502	She	2111	“ At your father ’s camp ? ”
80513	80576	80502	80502	She	2111	“ He had the most adorable art hut . Every summer after Mom and Dad divorced , we ’d spend it out at Camp Funshine . And the minute Mom let us out of the car , Hy would race for the archery range or the ropes course , and I ’d dash off in the other direction for the art hut . ”
80592	80597	80726	80726	her	2112	“ You miss it ? ”
80598	80665	80666	80666	I	0	“ Dad gave so many kids the best memories of their summers , and we met so many kids from all over the world . There was this girl I met from — oh my gosh , you know what ? I ca n’t start , because if I start telling you about all of the people I met there , I would literally never stop . ”
80674	80683	80672	80672	Begonia	127	“ Have you been back as an adult ? ”
80684	80720	80726	80726	her	2112	“ No . The people who bought it when Dad declared bankruptcy just wanted the land . And the lake . And the stables . It’s — it ’s not what it used to be . ”
80839	80845	80862	80862	she	2112	“ Your father declared bankruptcy . ”
80869	80905	80862	80862	she	2112	“ Yes . It was n’t pleasant , but he survived . I mean , not long , but it was n’t … It was n’t bankruptcy that killed him . That was an accident . ”
80906	80920	80921	80921	Her	2112	“ You were n’t terrified at all when I threatened to sue you . ”
80929	80976	80921	80921	Her	2112	“ I would ’ve been sad if you ’d followed through and I had to raise funds by putting my great - grandma Eileen ’s old dildo collection on eBay to afford my own legal fees , but yes , I know I would ’ve survived . ”
80977	80984	80862	80862	she	2112	“ I ’m quite the asshole . ”
80985	81000	81001	81001	I	0	“ Hayes . You found a total stranger making a disaster of your house . ”
81012	81022	81001	81001	I	0	“ That turned out far better than I expected . ”
81023	81030	81031	81031	she	2112	“ And look at us now , ”
81041	81048	80862	80862	she	2112	“ Do you still enjoy camping ? ”
81049	81092	81001	81001	I	0	“ I used to , but then — well , then I grew up and did what I thought grown - ups should do , which is dumb , is n’t it ? Why ca n’t grown - ups have fun too ? ”
81093	81103	81104	81104	She	2112	“ Are you not having fun tonight , Begonia ? ”
81268	81332	81257	81257	she	127	“ I ’m having the best time . Do you know what ? Summer camp should be a thing for grown - ups too . We should get to play and have fun and let someone else make us cafeteria food after we spend the morning canoeing and swimming and horseback riding , and then get to have grown - up time afterwards . ”
81333	81370	81257	81257	she	127	“ You ’ve just described Rutherford family reunions , but without the horrors of cafeteria food , and I honestly do n’t want to know which of my relatives are engaging in grown - up time . ”
81371	81401	81402	81402	I	0	“ Did you go to summer camp as a kid ? The traditional kind where you sleep away from your parents for a week or more at a time ? ”
81413	81444	81402	81402	I	0	“ Every summer from six to sixteen , but it was crew — rowing — camp , or lacrosse camp , or math camp , or college application prep camp . ”
81445	81453	81257	81257	she	127	“ Did you shoot bows and arrows ? ”

81469	81476	81257	81257	she	127	“ Eat s’mores around the campfire ? ”
81477	81505	81506	81506	She	2123	“ We had crème brûlée and chocolate lava cakes catered by Michelin - level chefs while we sat around getting lectures about how to apply for college . ”
81509	81523	81506	81506	She	2123	“ Had you never had a s’more before our campfire picnic in Maine ? ”
81534	81546	81524	81524	I	0	“ How many Razzle Dazzle films have you seen , bluebell ? ”
81547	81600	81601	81601	I	0	“ At least four hundred thirty - seven . I was watching them before Jonas started getting starring roles . I miss the days when Hank Houseman was your main lead . He was too old for me to be attracted to , but I could n’t help myself . Just shew . ”
81609	81626	81601	81601	I	0	“ How many of those four hundred thirty - seven Razzle Dazzle films had campfire scenes ? ”
81686	81693	81694	81694	she	2123	“ Are you telling me lies ? ”
81697	81728	81694	81694	she	2123	“ College application prep camp ? You are ! You ’re making that up , and you ’ve had s’mores , and you did go to traditional summer sleepaway camp . ”
81729	81744	81783	81783	she	2123	“ I believe it ’s called teasing when done in the midst of flirting . ”
81745	81754	81783	81783	she	2123	“ You are the most adorable flirter ever . ”
81755	81758	81759	81759	She	2123	“ Adorable ? ”
81763	81767	81768	81768	I	0	“ So adorable . ”

81947	81970	81971	81971	Keisha	121	“ Did you save some charcuterie for the squirrels and the birds , or did you do something super kinky with it ? ”
81991	81995	81974	81974	Hayes	147	“ Go away . ”
81996	82019	82020	82020	I	0	“ Your mother ’s looking for you . Something about the dog and a movie script she was supposed to be evaluating . ”
82023	82027	82028	82028	Hayes	147	“ Ignore her , ”
82032	82065	82066	82066	Keisha	121	“ My mother does n’t evaluate movie scripts . Not to say your dog did n’t attempt to help her with her perfume , but Marshmallow would not be stealing important paperwork . ”
82069	82074	82066	82066	Keisha	121	“ Nice tattoo , B. ”
82105	82128	82129	82129	he	147	“ Go away , Keisha , or I ’ll tell Millie what you do with your drummer when you ’re on tour , ”
82160	82165	82157	82157	She	121	“ You would n’t . ”

82183	82202	82176	82176	I	0	“ I do n’t want to know . No . I do n’t . Do n’t ruin this . ”
82203	82224	82225	82225	Hayes	163	“ Yes , she ’s cheating . And her version of cheating is three am runs to Baskin - Robbins , ”
82230	82239	82225	82225	Hayes	163	“ She ’s diabetic , and Millie worries . ”
82240	82244	82245	82245	Keisha	121	“ Shut up , ”
82248	82260	82261	82261	Hayes	163	“ It ’s nothing to be embarrassed about , dear cousin , ”
82264	82312	82261	82261	Hayes	163	“ I ’m not embarrassed . I do n’t want to have a fight with Millie if she hears you talking smack and spilling my secrets . And I can have ice cream . I can . She overreacts to everything because she loves me so much . ”
82332	82337	82338	82338	Keisha	121	“ Relax , B , ”
82341	82360	82338	82338	Keisha	121	“ Marshmallow ’s inside . Françoise has him . She ’s almost as good with him as Hayes . ”
82374	82384	82385	82385	he	163	“ He took our clothing , did n’t he ? ”
82391	82453	82388	82388	Keisha	121	“ It ’s aaaaall over the downstairs . He took Begonia ’s bra in to your father , and your mom has your boxers . My dad got the strip of condoms . It ’s too bad Liliane left , or maybe she could ’ve gotten your tie and Begonia ’s panties . This is like , the best morning ever . ”
82454	82468	82469	82469	I	0	“ How is it I still like her even when she ’s evil ? ”
82481	82496	82473	82473	He	147	“ I have no idea . I ’m not suffering from the same affliction . ”
82541	82552	82553	82553	she	2129	“ Robert ’s coming with clothes for both of you , ”
82557	82574	82553	82553	she	2129	“ But it was just too fun to catch you sleeping outside naked like randy teenagers . ”
82575	82586	82587	82587	Hayes	147	“ Good . I ’ll have him throw you out . ”
82630	82637	82638	82638	Keisha	121	“ But where would I go ? ”
82641	82696	82638	82638	Keisha	121	“ You know Millie ’s allergic to South Carolina this time of year , so that house is out . There ’s a chance of wildfires out west , so those two houses are out . If I head into the city , I ’ll eat cheesecake all day , so that ’s out … ”
82697	82700	82701	82701	Hayes	163	“ Antarctica , ”
82727	82739	82740	82740	Keisha	121	“ Begonia , have you ever seen a K - drama ? ”
82743	82763	82740	82740	Keisha	121	“ We should totes have a girls morning and you can explain to me why penises are worth it . ”
82764	82773	82774	82774	Hayes	147	“ Do n’t you have work to do ? ”
82777	82786	82787	82787	She	121	“ No one works on a forced sabbatical . ”
82805	82812	82813	82813	I	0	“ Why are you on sabbatical ? ”
82816	82850	82813	82813	I	0	“ Do you know the best thing about being a distant Rutherford relative ? They seriously cover up some shit . And I like you , B , but I ’m not telling . ”
82851	82866	82867	82867	Hayes	147	“ Understandable . If you want to talk , though , I ’m around . ”
82872	82913	82867	82867	Hayes	147	“ You have three seconds to leave before I treat you to a full frontal and chase you back to the house and tell Begonia all of your secrets . You told her mine . I ’ll happily spill yours . ”
82920	82947	82914	82914	She	121	“ Fine . I ’m going . Come find me for breakfast , Begonia . I want to know how you got that awesome hair color . ”
82960	82968	82955	82955	I	0	“ Have you chased her naked before ? ”
82969	82984	83020	83020	Hayes	147	“ No , but she believes I ’d do it . That ’s enough . ”
82985	82994	82995	82995	Keisha	121	“ Such a terrible threat , Mr. Rutherford . ”
83062	83104	83105	83105	I	0	“ It was you or me , and she already has the advantage of seeing some mystery tattoo that I have yet to discover on your body . I have no intention of letting her see it more before I do . ”
83111	83121	83105	83105	I	0	“ You did n’t look closely enough in Maine . ”
83122	83135	83152	83152	his	147	“ I was quite unaware of who I ’d found in Maine . ”
83136	83149	83150	83150	He	147	“ And you were tired and cranky and expecting an empty house . ”
83164	83174	83175	83175	he	147	“ I ’m tired of being tired and cranky , ”
83178	83187	83175	83175	he	147	“ Are you tired and cranky right now ? ”
83188	83198	83199	83199	I	0	“ I ’m far more content than I trust . ”
83238	83250	83223	83223	I	0	“ Do n’t question it . Just let yourself have it . ”

83257	83264	83265	83265	Robert	200	“ Your clothes , Mr. Rutherford , ”
83270	83288	83265	83265	Robert	200	“ Merriweather called and reported you ’ve been requested for interviews with several news networks this morning . ”
83368	83375	83352	83352	his	147	“ Why did Merriweather call you ? ”
83376	83387	83388	83388	Robert	200	“ I located your phone in the freezer , sir , ”
83415	83428	83405	83405	Hayes	147	“ Is that the weirdest place you ’ve ever found a phone ? ”
83459	83464	83465	83465	he	147	“ Today , ma’am , ”
83468	83475	83465	83465	he	147	“ Nikolay would ’ve told me . ”
83538	83552	83553	83553	Hayes	147	“ We ’ll be back at the house in fifteen minutes , Robert , ”
83556	83578	83553	83553	Hayes	147	“ Certainly , sir . But as a matter of note , your father ’s requested a video conference over breakfast . ”
83582	83597	83553	83553	Hayes	147	“ Are n’t your parents here ? I thought Marshmallow took them our clothes . ”
83598	83615	83616	83616	Hayes	147	“ We ’re an early - rising , early - working , early - traveling family , ”
83619	83626	83616	83616	Hayes	147	“ Also , never trust Keisha . ”
83627	83637	83638	83638	Robert	200	“ Unless you ’re broke and lost in Amsterdam , ”
83641	83652	83653	83653	Hayes	147	“ Or facing down a gang of kangaroos outside Sydney , ”
83656	83662	83653	83653	Hayes	147	“ Fifteen minutes , Robert . ”
83663	83668	83680	83680	him	147	“ Yes , sir . ”
83669	83676	83677	83677	I	0	“ Thank you for the clothes , ”
83704	83739	83689	83689	Hayes	147	“ I ’m quite irritated that your dog stole my condoms . And I would very much like to have been the first person in my family to have studied this tattoo of yours . ”
83752	83764	83740	83740	I	0	“ Guess I ’ll have to make that up to you . ”
83781	83784	83770	83770	I	0	“ Begonia ? ”
83785	83790	83765	83765	His	147	“ Yes , Hayes ? ”

84033	84067	84022	84022	she	127	“ Third pregnancies always make you look like you could deliver any minute from the fifth month on . So . Are you making an honest woman of my sister , or what ? ”
84073	84080	84081	84081	She	127	“ Good luck , Mr. Rutherford . ”

84129	84157	84109	84109	I	0	“ Oh , you are fancy . Are you sure you ’re in love with my sister ? She ’s as anti - fancy as they get . ”
84158	84167	84168	84168	Evan	247	“ All the more reason to adore her . ”
84173	84197	84168	84168	Evan	247	“ Hyacinth , meet Mr. Sirotkin . We ’re hoping you could help us narrow down choices for a surprise for your sister . ”
84198	84203	84109	84109	I	0	“ Are those diamonds ? ”
84204	84210	84109	84109	I	0	“ Yes , Mrs. Werenski . ”
84211	84229	84230	84230	She	2156	“ Like , that whole thing is a diamond ? All of those whole things are diamonds ? ”
84261	84264	84265	84265	She	2156	“ Yes . ”
84279	84303	84265	84265	She	2156	“ I ’m trying to decide if I should ask how well you know my sister , or how badly you fucked up . ”
84367	84377	84378	84378	I	0	“ Evan , could you give us a moment ? ”
84381	84388	84378	84378	I	0	“ Shall I leave the jewels ? ”
84389	84400	84401	84401	Hyacinth	127	“ Only if he ’s buying them for someone else , ”
84416	84425	84426	84426	he	2160	“ Your mother ’s birthday is coming up , ”
84434	84452	84426	84426	he	2160	“ Jonas drew the short end of the stick this year . He ’ll be in touch . ”
84459	84483	84453	84453	Hyacinth	127	“ I keep forgetting you ’re Jonas Rutherford ’s brother . Can I touch you again ? Maybe have a lick in absentia ? ”
84484	84487	84429	84429	he	2160	“ No . ”
84488	84509	84515	84515	Evan	247	“ Phew . Thank you . If you can be a little more dickish like that , it ’ll help . ”
84543	84549	84536	84536	Hyacinth	127	“ Is this place bugged ? ”
84550	84553	84429	84429	he	2160	“ No . ”
84554	84568	84429	84429	he	2160	“ Will Begonia get in trouble with you if I ask rude questions ? ”
84569	84610	84536	84536	Hyacinth	127	“ Your sister could talk her way out of a murder conviction if she were caught holding a bloody knife over the victim . If the police do n’t stand a chance , I fail to see how I do . ”
84611	84639	84640	84640	My	0	“ Because she would n’t have done it . There would be a logical explanation . Probably that her dog did it , but he was justified . ”
84644	84653	84640	84640	My	0	“ Oh my god , you almost smiled . ”
84661	84767	84654	84654	Her	127	“ Are you seriously dating my sister , or are you blackmailing her with something , or is she doing you a favor ? What ’s going on here ? This has all the makings of a Razzle Dazzle movie , and Begonia is totally lying to me about something , probably a lot of things , and I ’m pretty sure you ’re banging her , but that does n’t mean anything beyond that she ’s getting some nookie post - divorce so she can get back on that horse for real again soon . I mean , if you ’re not for real . ”
84783	84788	84768	84768	I	0	“ Are you finished ? ”
84789	84922	84923	84923	Hyacinth	127	“ No . Not even close . Is Jonas ’s marriage real , or was that staged for someone ’s reputation rehab , because Peyton Baker ? Really ? And if you two were the two last eligible male billionaires left on the planet , that would almost be too much , you know ? And totally unfair to you , because he ’d get all the attention , but then , he always does , does n’t he ? It ’s like I always thought Begonia would resent me for getting all the attention , but she ’s just so nice , and she did n’t care that I got to play Annie in the school play and she was stuck in the chorus , because she ’s always — oof . ”
84939	84945	84933	84933	I	0	“ Are you in labor ? ”
84946	84970	84971	84971	She	127	“ No , the little bastard just kicked me in the ribs . He does n’t like it when I talk too much . ”
84976	84990	84971	84971	She	127	“ Do not say a word . I ’ve heard it all already . ”
85021	85036	85014	85014	She	127	“ Your turn . Spill your guts . Why are you dating my sister ? ”
85037	85056	85014	85014	She	127	“ She ’s disarmingly attractive , inside and out , and I ca n’t seem to help myself . ”
85057	85070	85014	85014	She	127	“ Did you really make her sign a non - disclosure agreement ? ”
85071	85082	85014	85014	She	127	“ I made you sign a non - disclosure agreement . ”
85083	85125	85126	85126	She	2164	“ Yeah , but you ’re not dating me . You ’re just tormenting me by not answering my questions after flying me up here on a fancy jet because you thought it would be a nice surprise for my sister . ”
85149	85157	85141	85141	She	2164	“ Are you going to hurt Begonia ? ”

85591	85605	85606	85606	Hyacinth	127	“ Do I really get to see her as part of this trip ? ”
85609	85636	85606	85606	Hyacinth	127	“ Naturally . She needs a new dress for a charity gala in the city tomorrow . I assumed you ’d be her preferred shopping companion . ”
85637	85645	85657	85657	She	127	“ Can I go to the gala ? ”
85646	85656	85657	85657	She	127	“ The Rutherfords are known for not making scenes . ”

86077	86178	86199	86199	I	0	“ Hayes said you missed me so he sent a fucking private jet to get me and a private nanny to stay behind with my kids and we ’re going to the spa and taking you shopping for a new fucking dress and what did you do and how did you meet this man and does he have a secret twin ? I do n’t want another husband , but I could totally do with a rich lover who buys me fancy dresses and takes me to fancy balls . Oh my god , Begonia . Just oh my god . ”
86179	86194	86195	86195	She	2185	“ You ca n’t go to the ball ! Rutherfords do n’t make scenes . ”

86801	86903	86797	86797	I	0	“ I offered to take him for a walk , but the only place he wants to go is upstairs to check on the progress in the bedroom . And god knows if Hayes wants that room finished , he should probably let the dog pick the decorations . Damn man wo n’t make a decision , and I ’ve had it up to here with Aunt Gio telling me I ’m wrong about what he ’d like . Hayes would love a disco ball in his bedroom , and I paid for it , so what ’s the big deal ? ”
86924	86933	86915	86915	I	0	“ What ’s up with you and Millie ? ”
86934	87021	87028	87028	her	127	“ She says I ’m overdramatic . Can you believe that ? I literally get paid to be dramatic . Sometimes I have to overdo it to stay current . And we ’re touching the feathers again . Honey , I can afford a new jumpsuit , but you ’re filthy , and it takes about six months to have every one of these sewn on by hand , so can you maybe wait for the touching until I ’m back in silk or glitter polyester ? ”
87022	87025	87028	87028	her	127	“ Sorry . ”
87043	87051	87038	87038	she	127	“ You ’re just so … real . ”

87063	87087	87060	87060	I	0	“ At the office . He put me in a helicopter . And this big scary guy stared at me the whole time . ”
87088	87108	87109	87109	Keisha	121	“ Probably thought you were gon na pull a Marshmallow and try to open the door mid - flight , ”
87112	87184	87109	87109	Keisha	121	“ Are you both ready to hit the spa ? Millie hates the spa , and I have to let her stew while she thinks I ’m stewing too . I ’ll send her a new Porsche and it ’ll all blow over — she ca n’t resist a good Porsche — but right now , I need someone wrapping my body in seaweed and telling me my pores are gorgeous . ”

87230	87275	87276	87276	I	0	“ Begonia , I like you a lot , but suggesting DIY spa days in these parts of the social ecosphere is like asking me if I know who Elvis Presley is . You do n’t ask , because you just know the answer . ”
87322	87419	87317	87317	Keisha	121	“ Oh my god , I ’m so glad Hayes finally found someone with a sense of humor . C’m on , ladies . Do n’t even bother getting changed . The spa will have robes for all of us . You . Begonia ’s twin . You ’re gon na have to leave your phone at home because I do n’t trust you yet . No pictures . Maybe later if you quit gaping at me like that . Nikolay ! Nikolay , we need the chopper , please . And Marshmallow needs a babysitter . ”

87467	87522	87462	87462	Keisha	121	“ Sweetie , we only go places where you could literally shit on the table and no one would blink . Do n’t shit on the table if you can help it , but for real — they can handle it if you need to pause mid - body wrap to take a piss . ”
87587	87597	87585	87585	himself	363	“ Good afternoon , Begonia . Having fun today ? ”
87639	87645	87612	87612	He	163	“ You brought me Hyacinth . ”

88127	88142	88143	88143	Keisha	121	“ Usually they ’d be separate treatments , but we ’re on a timeline , ”

Begonia swore you would n’t mind if I took the dress and ran . ”

93808	93916	93921	93921	I	0	“ Because I do n’t want you to be related to a movie star that I had a massive crush on for half of my life . I want you to be normal so that I do n’t look like I ’m only dating you to get close to your brother , because I do n’t care who you ’re related to , except for the part where I wish it was n’t him . You really are the jewel here . But oh my god , do you have any idea how much Hyacinth would be wetting herself right now even if she were n’t pregnant ? ”

94750	94775	94745	94745	Hayes	104	“ Not nearly so much as you , bluebell . Minus the flub , though you ’d be absolutely perfect with or without it . ”

95304	95323	95324	95324	She	138	“ I tried , but I do n’t know if they were smart enough to get the insults . ”
95388	95403	95404	95404	she	138	“ Shall I send yours back once my assistant has solved this little issue ? ”
95445	95455	95456	95456	he	104	“ Begonia would love to have her necklace back , ”
95459	95463	95456	95456	he	104	“ Thank you . ”

95581	95610	95611	95612	Peyton Baker	249	“ She ’s like a Thanksgiving turkey with her popper thingie stuck in the wing instead of the thigh . Ready to pop , but not fully baked . ”

Amelia , so good to see you again . Have your assistant ping mine . We ’ll do lunch next time I ’m in town . ”

98367	98469	98470	98470	She	127	“ My lawyer will draft a prenup before we land that will provide a comfortable stipend for you regardless of what happens next . I require at least two full years of marriage in exchange for supporting you in whatever endeavors would make you happiest , from teaching to making your own artwork to exploring anything else that would fill your heart with joy , and at the end of two years , if you ’ve found someone else you would rather be with , I ’ll grant you a quiet divorce with assistance for transition back to a normal life . ”
98678	98782	98783	98783	Her	2491	“ I ’ll do my best to charm your mother , though of course , it ’s in everyone ’s best interest if she abhors me . That will make our eventual split easier on you . And I work long hours , as you ’ve clearly realized , so if you wanted to live and work in Richmond as you ’ve been doing , I could commute back to New York during the week , keep my own quarters near you on the weekend , and be as little of an inconvenience in your life as you ’d like me to be . ”
98793	98800	98788	98788	her	2491	“ That ’s what you want . ”
98801	98856	98788	98788	her	2491	“ It ’s what must happen , Begonia . I ca n’t be the cause of scandal to my family , especially given my new position in the company , and I do n’t know if my influence alone will be enough for you to keep your teaching job if those photos appear anywhere . ”
98906	98911	98912	98912	she	2491	“ Take me home , ”

And I could roll with it . I could . You ’re supposed to love people . That ’s what makes the world a better place . And you ’ve been nothing but everything I always dreamed I wanted in a partner , except for one thing . You do n’t love me back . I ’ve spent too many years sacrificing what I deserve for what I thought should ’ve been good enough . I wo n’t do good enough with you . I wo n’t do easy with you . Or anyone . I will not settle for anything less than all - consuming , no - holding - back , nothing - else - matters , we - are - in - this - together , I - love - you - so - much - it - hurts love . ”

99995	100008	99987	99987	She	3241	“ You signed a contract to fake being his girlfriend . Why ? ”
100037	100040	100033	100033	I	0	“ What ? ”
100041	100109	100110	100110	I	0	“ That ’s your signature . I know your signature . How did they get your signature if it was fake ? And you were supposed to get engaged ? What did you do ? And talk fast , because I guarantee you , this is hitting the morning shows locally any minute , and Mom will be here like she can teleport the minute it does . ”
100185	100188	100189	100189	I	0	“ No , ”
100192	100271	100189	100189	I	0	“ Begonia . Ignore the picture . Also , anyone who comes after you for having sex in public will have to go through me first , because hello , that had to be hella fucking hot . But we need to talk about this headline . The Weird Rutherford Fakes A Girlfriend . And this contract that they printed . And how I ’m going to murder everyone in the Rutherford family for using you like this . ”
100272	100275	100399	100399	myself	0	“ No . ”

100321	100388	100189	100189	I	0	“ So you ’d take the fall for the BJ that ’s threatening to destroy the Rutherford family ’s reputation . Duh . I really hope he did a lot more than setting up the most gorgeous art room I ’ve ever seen for you in that mansion of his , because otherwise , his death will be slow and painful instead of quick and merciful . ”

100800	100928	100985	100985	She	2542	“ Begonia , you could fall in love with a turd - coated shape - shifting lemur . I realize Mr. Big Bucks was a little more handsome than that , and he gave us a good run of thinking he knew you and liked you , but sweetie , he betrayed you in the freaking gossip rags to save his family ’s reputation , and you are going to be okay . C’m on , Ms. Things Happen For A Reason . You can do private art lessons now . Take advantage of the notoriety and get a page up on Etsy with some of your attempts at spin - art . Sign them , and they ’ll be worth like , seven times as much . ”

101017	101030	100736	100736	she	127	“ Every freaking hour , but he takes care of it himself . ”
101041	101044	100736	100736	she	127	“ Begonia . ”
101045	101127	100736	100736	she	127	“ I ’ve cleaned up seven thousand dog messes in the park from other dogs ! If he makes a dozen messes that I do n’t clean while I ’m heartbroken and drowning my sorrows on my couch , then I do n’t care . And if my dog is smart enough to take the elevator down to the parking lot to poop , then find his way back , then why should n’t he have his freedom to do that ? ”
101128	101158	100985	100985	She	2542	“ Okay . Okay . I ’m texting Jerry . He ’ll do the whole apartment parking lot . He does n’t mind . He ’s worried about you . ”
101159	101163	100985	100985	She	2542	“ You settled . ”

101202	101242	100985	100985	She	2542	“ But you complain about him all the time . And the last time he took you on a date was months ago , and it was popcorn and hotdogs in your basement while you hid from the kids . ”
101243	101254	101255	101255	She	2544	“ Um , hello , that was a good date . ”
101268	101589	101255	101255	She	2544	“ Too good , unfortunately . And I ’m sorry I complain about him too much . It ’s not him . Exactly . It ’s raising two and a half minions and being overwhelmed and settling into — no , not settling , not like that — but just having routines and being so busy and forgetting to appreciate all the reasons I fell in love with him in the first place . Like , he gives me foot rubs every night . And he takes the kids to the park every Saturday morning so I can have one morning of bingeing adult TV while I drink my coffee hot . And do you remember when the preschool moms all rose up last year to protest Dani saying fuck ? Jerry was the first one to tell me that our kids will be just fine , because they wo n’t be afraid of profanity and they ’ll understand how and when to use it and that people are different and see things differently , and he went to the preschool meeting for me and read a list of cuss words and their etymology and talked about how when you stigmatize something , that makes it worse than it is all on its own . And he does n’t blink when I drink pickle smoothies or have ice cream dribble down my shirt , and he buys me tampons . I know he ’s not , like , a billionaire who can take me to Europe on a moment ’s notice — which I notice the billionaire who shall not be named did n’t do for you , by the way , despite teasing you incessantly about it — or get me tickets to a movie premiere or send me luxury chocolates every day , but he ’s my prince charming , even when I forget how much he does . ”

You do n’t get to realize what you lost after it ’s gone . You get to wallow in misery for the rest of your freaking forever . No , Mother , dead to me . Go . Go . Before I call Keisha Kourtney and ask her to take Begonia somewhere safe where none of us can ever bother her again , and that means none of us will ever see her again too . Do you understand ? ”

103313	103447	103448	103448	He	2583	“ Son , life ’s too short to spend it doing nothing but making other people happy . And god knows we parents get it wrong on occasion when it comes to guessing what that might be . If you ’re under the impression we expect you to pay us back for anything we ’ve ever given you in life , let me assure you , all we want is for you to do what makes you happy . Not what makes us happy . And it ’s time I put my money where my mouth is , so consider that this offer is as much for me as it is for you . If you ’re not happy , if you want out … now ’s the time to take a leap . ”
103458	103463	103454	103454	He	2583	“ Are you ill ? ”
103464	103481	103482	103482	I	0	“ No , merely disgusted with myself for taking the easy path for far too long . ”

Not a surface - level happy family , but a family of love and support and acceptance . The account sheets will be corrected when we announce it next week . Thomas was aware and had signed off on the various accounting tricks we needed to use for developing the project in complete secret . The rest of the board is ready to handle the media requests we would ’ve had him do , as we ’ve wanted to give you time to settle in before fully feeding you to the sharks . But Hayes , if this is n’t where your heart is — and I do n’t mean the company ’s growth and expansion into new markets that we should ’ve ventured into before this , but I mean you , in this chair — no one will think any less of you . I ’d hoped this job would be an opportunity , but I fear I ’ve actually put you into an obligation instead . ”

He even sent a girlfriend a hand - crafted German grandfather clock once . That young man put every ounce of his heart into every relationship he had , especially once that awful Sturgis boy decided to make his life a living hell in high school . He just wanted to believe that there was good in the world and that he could find it in relationships . ”

That Ella and Odette were only in it for the gifts , and that the rest of them got off on dating the weird Rutherford with the big trust fund and Razzle Dazzle Village season tickets . But he did n’t at the time . He took a long time to grow into his looks , he did n’t have the societal advantage of Jonas ’s natural charm — and I say that as his mother who thinks he ’s utterly perfect exactly the way he is — but he ’d cut his teeth watching Razzle Dazzle films , and that child believed in the power of love . He believed so hard in the power of love . ”

That I ’d see my boy again , the one who believed in the goodness of the world , who had hope , who had so much love to give , but he closed himself off so hard . It was three years before he dated anyone again , and the minute he so much as suspected someone wanted him for anything other than himself , she was out the door . He ’d bring the occasional date to an event , but I always assumed it was more to give meddling family members or the press something to talk about than it was because he truly enjoyed his date ’s company . He was keenly aware that if he was spotted in public with a woman , he ’d be labeled a playboy if he was spotted with a different woman anytime in a six - month window after that . He used it to his advantage . ”

105802	105879	105617	105617	Giovanna	150	“ Because you gave me back my little boy . You made him believe in love again . I have never — ever — seen him laugh with another woman the way I ’ve seen him laugh with you . Or stick up for another woman the way he sticks up for you . And I do n’t want what happened to him to happen to you merely because he ’s terrified to love you back . ”

105884	105961	105587	105587	I	0	“ Thomas ’s death shook him . It shook all of us . But then Mathias and Jonas both got married too , leaving Hayes as the world ’s most prominent single man in possession of such a large fortune , if you ’ll forgive the reference — I was worried he ’d do something drastic . I followed him to Maine with Amelia because I did n’t want him to do something he ’d regret . ”

He did n’t have to set my phone up on wifi so that I could talk to my sister . He did n’t have to fly her in to see me . He did n’t have to set up an art studio in his house so that I could make terrible pottery . But he listened . He paid attention . He did n’t mock me . He looked at me like I was beautiful , flaws and all . And it was n’t about the money . It was about the thought . He ’s the first man I ’ve known in my adult life who thought . And who cared enough to act on the thought . And I want — I want him to feel as much love as he made me feel with the simplest little things that no one else has ever done for me before . I want him to know how very much he deserves to be loved and adored . ”

107085	107116	107082	107082	Jonas	119	“ Next role is a broken - hearted miser hiding from the world in a cabin in the woods . This is character study . I ’m absorbing your aura . ”

107129	107173	107126	107126	Keisha	121	“ Your dad ’s afraid you ’ll bury your grief in one of your executive assistants , and yes , that ’s a euphemism , and apparently everyone likes them too much for us to have another situation like the one with Thomas . ”

107208	107245	107082	107082	Jonas	119	“ They ’re worried about you , Mr. Rutherford . Although their concerns that either of us would cross professional lines with you are unfounded . Also , tell Keisha that Millie would hate that statue . ”

107300	107350	107351	107351	Jonas	119	“ No , merely making random conversation since there ’s not much that makes you happy these days . Excuse me , Mr. Rutherford , but if there ’s nothing else I can do for you immediately , I have another stack of work from you that needs attention . ”

107776	107855	107773	107773	Jonas	119	“ No , because she ’s not a sucker . Also , she called up someone she used to know — don’t ask — and they went out riding last night — again , do n’t ask — and apparently found the ‘ reporter ’ who broke the story , and he swore up and down that he was lurking at the edges of Sagewood House ’s property when a miracle dog appeared and handed him the contract . ”

108227	108250	108224	108224	Merriweather	208	“ An intervention . You need your head removed from your nether regions , and we have nothing else left to lose . ”

108267	108306	108263	108263	Winnie	112	“ You miss Begonia , because she ’s Begonia , but you wo n’t do anything about it , because you ’re you , which is literally the only thing standing between you and Begonia being happy together . ”

108322	108332	108333	108333	Merriweather	208	“ Do you honestly think Begonia would reject you ? ”
108384	108394	108395	108395	Winnie	112	“ No , but she would n’t reject anyone . ”
108398	108416	108395	108395	Winnie	112	“ She divorced her husband . I ’d say the woman knows what she does n’t want . ”
108417	108423	108424	108424	Merriweather	208	“ And what she does , ”

108486	108545	108478	108478	I	0	“ Did it ever occur to you , Mr. Rutherford , that Begonia is just as afraid of not being loved as you are of not being loved enough by her ? Do you realize , to even the smallest degree , how unfair that is to her ? And how much she ’s probably hurting right now ? ”
108546	108552	108553	108553	Merriweather	208	“ Love ’s a leap . ”
108583	108604	108605	108605	I	0	“ Begonia is Begonia , and she probably has more men vying for her attention now than I have women , ”
108608	108617	108618	108618	Merriweather	208	“ Probably not , because men are dumb , ”

108701	108715	108695	108695	Merriweather	208	“ a safe life without love , or a risky life with it ? ”
108716	108731	108732	108732	Merriweather	208	“ We ’re basically pulling our hair out over how dense you ’re being , ”
108736	108782	108732	108732	Merriweather	208	“ It ’s Begonia . One , she clearly adores you . Two , all she really asks in return is that you adore her back . Three , she did n’t want to fall in love at all , yet here you both are . ”
108783	108813	108695	108695	Merriweather	208	“ She flew across the country to rescue the world ’s worst dog . If she can love Marshmallow , surely , she can stay loyal to you too . ”

108832	108857	108823	108823	Winnie	112	“ No , no , you do n’t get to talk yet . Do you know anyone in this world more loyal than Begonia ? ”

108886	108898	108695	108695	Merriweather	208	“ Are you a bigger dick than her ex - husband ? ”
108899	108959	108962	108962	them	2647	“ Only to people who are not Begonia . Probably to people sitting here in my office who should be biting their tongues right now , and who are only still employed because you ’ve clearly been talking to her behind my back , and I want to know what you know , and I want to know now . ”
108969	108977	108978	108978	Winnie	112	“ We have n’t talked to her , ”

109012	109021	108978	108978	Winnie	112	“ And the way she looked at you — ”
109022	109030	108695	108695	Merriweather	208	“ We ’re assuming we ’re right . ”
109031	109058	108962	108962	them	2647	“ So what the h - e - double - hockey - sticks are you doing here instead of chasing her down and getting her back ? ”
109059	109062	108978	108978	Winnie	112	“ I — ”

I swear , you stole it the minute you confused me with a dead president , and I do n’t know how that ’s even possible , but it ’s the simple truth . I want to be where you are . I want to bask in your sunshine . And I want to show you every single day how perfect and precious and adored you are . ”

I ’d become unemployed as well , if you do , and would have to spend my days as a mostly useless freeloader happily fetching all the chewed - up wooden works of art your dog can get his jaws on . And that idea does have its own merit . I would be quite content fetching your coffee and tea and art supplies and keeping you from defiling kitchens all day long . ”

113113	113139	113110	113110	I	0	“ I was thinking beef , or chicken , or even tofu . Eating kids is frowned upon , and adults can get rather chewy . ”

Maybe someone convinced me that it ’ll be another profitable venture for the town to leak pictures of you doing things like walking through goat shit and falling out of boats to a few tabloids back in New York . From where I stand , Ms. Lightly , you ’re the one with a greater incentive to leave . ”
