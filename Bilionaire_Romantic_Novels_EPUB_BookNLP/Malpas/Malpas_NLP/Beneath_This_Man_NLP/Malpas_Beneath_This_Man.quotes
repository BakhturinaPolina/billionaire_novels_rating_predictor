86	131	85	85	I	363	’m at a complete loss . Empty and incomplete . He made me need him , and now he ’s gone . In the darkness I see his face and in the silence I hear his voice . There is no escaping it . I ’m

565	664	564	564	I	363	’m lucky that I ’ve managed to avoid any pressing questions from Patrick regarding Mr Ward ’s project . When one hundred thousand pounds landed in Rococo Union ’s bank account , courtesy of Mr Ward , I was immensely grateful . With so much money paid up front , I could fob Patrick off with an imaginary business trip that ’s keeping Mr Ward out of the country and the project on hold . I know I ’ll have to deal with this eventually , I just do n’t feel strong enough at the moment , and I ’m
715	776	714	714	I	363	’m happier festering in my bed . And she meets me without fail every lunchtime . Not that I eat anything . It ’s hard enough to swallow , without trying to get food past the permanent lump that ’s wedged in my throat . The only thing I look forward to at the moment is my morning walk . I ’m
857	957	856	856	I	363	’m ready to wander back slowly to prepare myself for another day without Jesse . How long can I go on like this ? My brother , Dan , is back in London tomorrow after visiting my parents in Cornwall . I should be looking forward to seeing him , it ’s been six months since I last did , but where am I going to find the energy to put on a front ? With the added benefit of Matt ’s friendly little phone call to my Mum , informing her that I was seeing another man , I ’m
998	1222	1223	1224	Miss Quinn	65	’m on the other end of a phone and she ca n’t see me twiddling my hair . What would I tell them ? That I have fallen in love with a man and I do n’t know how old he is ? He owns a sex club and , oh yes , he ’s an alcoholic . I ’ve not helped myself by not making the trip to see them , my work excuse pitiful , and I fully expect the third degree from Dan when I see him tomorrow . I need to prepare myself for his questioning . It ’s going to be the grilling of my life . My mobile blurts from my desk , dragging me from my daydreams and tapping pen . It ’s Ruth Quinn . I inwardly groan . This woman is proving to be a challenge herself . She rang on Tuesday and demanded an appointment for the same day , and I explained that I was busy and suggested someone else may be able to make it , but she insisted she wanted me . She eventually settled for my first appointment , which happened to be today , and she has since called every day to remind me . I should just ignore it , but she will only call the office . ‘
1226	1231	1232	1232	Ava	0	’ I greet tiredly . ‘
1238	1258	1259	1259	I	363	’ She always asks , which is nice , I suppose . I wo n’t tell her the truth . ‘
1260	1266	1259	1259	I	363	’m good . And you ? ’
1267	1274	1275	1275	she	65	‘ Yes , yes , fine , ’
1278	1287	1275	1275	she	65	‘ I just wanted to check our appointment . ’
1310	1317	1298	1298	I	363	‘ Four thirty , Miss Quinn . ’
1327	1336	1318	1318	I	363	‘ Lovely , I look forward to it . ’
1337	1344	1345	1345	I	363	‘ Great , see you then . ’
1403	1409	1399	1399	She	67	‘ What have you done ? ’
1419	1456	1418	1418	I	363	’m not seeing particularly clearly at the moment , but there ’s no ignoring the tone of her skin . She rolls her eyes and retrieves her compact mirror from her Mulberry to inspect her face . ‘
1460	1464	1465	1465	I	363	’ she warns . ‘
1470	1480	1481	1483	The stupid woman	252	’ She scrubs at her face with a tissue . ‘
1496	1508	1489	1489	I	363	’ She continues to scrub her face while huffing and puffing . ‘
1523	1533	1489	1489	I	363	’ I advise , turning back to my computer . ‘
1544	1548	1549	1549	Drew	68	’ she cries . ‘
1568	1569	1556	1556	He	68	’ ‘
1575	1579	1580	1580	Langan	69	’ I ask . ‘
1599	1654	1592	1592	I	363	’ This is a complete catastrophe for Victoria . She and Drew have only been seeing each other for a week , another relationship off the back of my cluster fuck of a life . All I need now is for Tom to walk in and declare he ’s getting married . Selfishly , I ’m
1683	1692	1693	1693	she	59	‘ Wow ! Victoria , are you okay ? ’
1723	1726	1727	1727	Victoria	67	‘ Fine ! ’
1752	1757	1758	1758	I	363	‘ Where ’s Tom ? ’
1802	1816	1817	1817	she	59	‘ He ’s at Mrs Baines . It would appear the nightmare continues . ’
1917	1990	1991	1991	You	261	’m completely stunned . Her voice does n’t match her appearance in the slightest . I had her down as a middle aged spinster , piano teacher type , but I could n’t have been further from the mark . She ’s very attractive , with long blonde hair , big blue eyes and smooth pale skin , and she is wearing a lovely black dress with killer wedges . She smiles . ‘
2001	2013	2014	2015	Miss Quinn	65	’ She directs me through to a horrendous seventies throwback kitchen . ‘
2020	2047	2014	2015	Miss Quinn	65	’ I hand her my file , and she takes it keenly . She has a really warm smile . Maybe I got her all wrong . ‘
2065	2075	2076	2076	Lusso	73	’ she says as she flicks through the file . ‘
2080	2081	2076	2076	Lusso	73	’ ‘
2087	2094	2084	2084	you	64	’ I sound surprised , but I ’m
2131	2155	2122	2122	Lusso	73	‘ Yes , of course ! Everyone ’s talking about it . You did an amazing job . Would you like a drink ? ’
2156	2166	2167	2167	She	0	‘ A coffee would be good , thank you . ’
2175	2183	2167	2167	She	0	‘ Please , sit down , Ava . ’
2208	2220	2221	2221	She	0	‘ So , what can I help you with , Ruth ? ’
2236	2249	2250	2250	she	0	‘ Need you ask ? It ’s hideous , is n’t it ? ’
2268	2289	2292	2292	I	363	’m not about to gasp in horror at the brown and yellow arrangement with faux brick walls . She continues , ‘
2293	2324	2325	2325	She	0	’m looking for some ideas to transform this monstrosity . I was thinking of knocking through and making it a large family room . Here , I ’ll show you . ’
2366	2399	2365	2365	I	363	’m guessing she ’s not long moved in . This place does n’t look like it has been touched with a paintbrush in forty years . After an hour of discussions , I ’m
2424	2451	2416	2416	She	0	‘ I will draft a few designs in line with your budget and ideas , and get them to you with a schedule of my fees , ’
2457	2460	2456	2456	I	363	’m leaving . ‘
2471	2472	2416	2416	She	0	’ ‘
2496	2508	2481	2481	I	363	’ She puts her hand out and I take it politely . ‘
2513	2517	2481	2481	I	363	’ She laughs . ‘
2520	2535	2536	2536	I	363	’ I smile tightly , the mention of alcohol making my blood run cold . ‘
2545	2546	2547	2547	Ruth	64	’ ‘
2551	2557	2547	2547	Ruth	64	’ she shakes her head . ‘
2566	2567	2571	2571	Ruth	64	’ ‘
2573	2633	2634	2634	Ava	0	’ I leave Miss Quinn , relieved that I ’ve fulfilled all necessary pleasantries , for now , anyway – until I meet my brother tomorrow . I drag myself down the street towards Kate ’s house , hoping she ’s not home so I can retreat to my room before she resumes mission perk - Ava - up . ‘
2636	2655	2658	2658	Samuel	564	’ I stop and see Sam hanging out of his car window as he cruises slowly beside me . ‘
2660	2673	2674	2674	Ava	0	’ I say on a strained smile as I carry on walking . ‘
2700	2748	2749	2749	I	363	’ He parks up and gets out of his Porsche , meeting me on the pavement outside Kate ’s house . He looks his usual laidback self , with ridiculously baggy shorts , a Rolling Stones t - shirt and his mousey brown hair a disheveled mess . ‘
2750	2760	2761	2761	I	363	’m sorry . Have you moved in permanently now ? ’
2803	2826	2827	2827	He	564	‘ No , I have n’t . Kate said you would be home by six . I was hoping to catch you . ’
2840	2845	2846	2846	I	363	‘ Is everything okay ? ’
2863	2877	2878	2878	he	564	‘ Not really . Ava , I need you to come with me . ’
2882	2885	2878	2878	he	564	‘ Where ? ’
2907	2913	2899	2899	He	564	‘ To Jesse ’s place . ’
2979	2988	2989	2989	Sam	564	’m returning to that place – not ever . ‘
2997	3025	3026	3026	Ava	0	’ I take a step back , shaking my head . My body has started shaking too . He sighs and scuffs his trainers on the pavement . ‘
3029	3074	3028	3028	I	363	’m getting worried . He ’s not answering his phone and no one has heard from him . I do n’t know what else to do . I know you do n’t want to talk about him , but it ’s been nearly five days ’
3120	3121	3124	3124	Sam	564	’ ‘
3127	3134	3135	3135	I	363	’m sorry , I ca n’t . ’
3138	3142	3144	3144	he	273	‘ Ava , I ’m
3152	3179	3180	3180	Sam	564	’ My throat starts to close up and Sam starts walking towards me with his hands outstretched . I did n’t realise I was moving backwards . ‘
3208	3230	3231	3231	Ava	0	’ He grabs my hands to halt my retreat , pulling me into his chest and holding me tight against him . ‘
3255	3281	3286	3286	him	273	’ My shoulders droop , defeated in his embrace , and a quiet sob escapes , just when I thought there were no tears left . ‘
3290	3291	3288	3288	Sam	564	’ ‘
3294	3303	3288	3288	Sam	564	’ He pulls back and looks at me . ‘
3315	3318	3319	3319	He	273	’m asking . ’
3329	3331	3319	3319	He	273	‘ I ’m
3336	3363	3364	3364	Ava	0	’ I affirm , my stomach a knot of panic at the thought of seeing him again . But what if he has done something stupid . ‘
3374	3384	3364	3364	Ava	0	’ I nod and wipe away the rolling tears . ‘
3388	3396	3386	3386	you	273	’ He tugs me towards his Porsche . ‘
3408	3531	3400	3400	Drew	68	’ He opens the passenger door and directs me into the car . With John and Drew meeting us there , he must have assumed I would agree . I ca n’t blame the guy for being optimistic . I climb in and let Sam drive me to Lusso at St Katherine Docks – a place I swore that I would never return to again . Chapter 2 As Lusso comes into view , I start hyperventilating . The overwhelming desire to open the door and jump out of Sam ’s moving car is hard to resist . He glances at me , an obvious anxious look on his cute face , as if he senses my intention to bolt . Once we ’re
3593	3645	3646	3646	Ava	0	’m more than shocked when he takes over Sam ’s hold of me , though , pulling me into him and squeezing me hard . This is the first actual contact I ’ve ever had with the man . To say he was stand - offish would be a major understatement . ‘
3653	3678	3646	3646	Ava	0	’ he says , holding me in his tight clinch . I say nothing because I really do n’t know what to say . They ’re
3720	3727	3714	3714	Sam	564	‘ Here ’s the big guy . ’
4009	4012	4004	4004	his	76	‘ Clive , ’
4040	4049	4020	4020	He	76	‘ Hello , Ava . How are you ? ’
4050	4052	4055	4055	Clive	76	‘ I ’m
4057	4067	4068	4068	You	76	’ I lie . I am far from good . ‘
4070	4071	4074	4074	I	363	’ ‘
4075	4078	4079	4079	He	76	’m fine . ’
4112	4133	4134	4134	I	363	‘ Clive , I would be grateful if you would let us up to the penthouse to check on Jesse . ’
4158	4178	4179	4179	He	76	‘ Ava , I have told your friends here , I could lose my job if I allow that . ’
4187	4190	4179	4179	He	76	’ again . ‘
4198	4201	4202	4202	I	363	’re worried . ’
4209	4226	4197	4197	they	296	‘ They just want to check he ’s okay , and then they ’ll be leaving . ’
4248	4320	4321	4321	I	363	‘ Ava , I have been up and knocked on Mr Ward ’s door and got no response . We ’ve checked some of the CCTV , and I have not seen him leave or return on my watch . Security can not check five days of continuous footage . I have told your friends this . If I let you up , it ’s more than my job is worth . ’
4322	4385	4321	4321	I	363	’m stunned at Clive ’s sudden turnabout in concierge etiquette . If only he had been this professional and stubborn when I came to see Jesse on Sunday , then we might never have had the altercation we did . But then I would still be blissfully unaware of Jesse ’s little problem . I feel Sam press up against my back . ‘
4394	4416	4420	4420	myself	363	’ he yells over my shoulder . I flinch slightly , but I ca n’t blame him for being frustrated . I ’m
4517	4528	4529	4529	I	363	‘ Clive , I would hate to resort to blackmail . ’
4567	4595	4596	4596	I	363	‘ I would hate for anyone to find out about Mr Gomez ’s regular visitors , or Mr Holland ’s aversion to a Thai girl or two . ’
4610	4620	4596	4596	I	363	‘ Ava , you play nasty , my girl . ’
4621	4631	4632	4632	I	363	‘ You leave me no other choice , Clive . ’
4653	4656	4657	4657	Sam	564	‘ Brilliant ! ’
4699	4707	4708	4708	I	363	‘ Jesse might have changed the code . ’
4724	4739	4721	4721	I	363	‘ If he has , then there is no way of getting up there . ’
4746	4853	4745	4745	I	363	’m stood in front of the elevator , taking a deep breath and punching in the developer code . There ’s a chorus of exhales as the doors open and they all get in . I stand on the outside and look up at Sam , and he smiles , jerking his head mildly , encouraging me to board with them . I do . I get in the elevator , Sam and Drew flanking me on one side , John on the other . I enter the code again . We travel up in an uncomfortable silence , and as the lift doors open , we ’re
4895	4903	4904	4904	Drew	68	‘ Jesse ! Open the fucking door ! ’
4960	4972	4973	4973	Drew	68	‘ Sam , mate , he might not even be here . ’
4976	4984	4985	4985	Sam	564	‘ Where the hell is he then ? ’
4988	4996	4997	4997	John	564	‘ Oh , he ’s in there , ’
5000	5024	5025	5025	I	363	‘ And the mother fucker has been drowning in his sorrows for too long now . He ’s got a business to run . ’
5026	5180	5181	5181	Ava	0	’m still stood in the elevator when the doors start to shut , snapping me out of my dazed state . My natural reflex has my arm flinging up to stop them closing before I step out into the penthouse foyer . I know I said that I would get them up here and leave , I know I should just go , but seeing Sam in such a state has me even more worried , and John ’s words are prickling me . Drowning in his sorrows or drowning in vodka ? If I stay , am I going to be faced with drunken , raging Jesse again ? Drew knocks on the door calmly . It ’s laughable . If Sam ’s relentless hammering does n’t get a response , then I doubt Drew ’s gentlemanly tapping will . He steps away from the door and drags Sam over to me . ‘
5189	5193	5181	5181	Ava	0	’ Drew asks . ‘
5196	5207	5210	5210	he	304	’ I blurt . Why would I do that ? I ’m
5219	5224	5225	5225	Sam	564	‘ Can you try ? ’
5234	5242	5225	5225	Sam	564	‘ He would n’t answer , Sam . ’
5243	5251	5252	5252	Drew	68	‘ Ava , will you just try ? ’
5287	5294	5286	5286	I	363	’m not sure what on earth I ’m
5310	5317	5318	5318	He	431	‘ I can hear it ringing . ’
5713	5742	5743	5743	He	431	’m greeted by Jesse ’s naked , unconscious body face down on the decking . I choke on my heart and my pulse starts pounding in my ears . ‘
5747	5835	5836	5836	Jesse	431	’ I scream , running towards his lifeless body and throwing my bag down as I collapse by his side . I grip his big shoulders to try and turn him over . I do n’t know where I get my strength from , but I manage it , yanking him over so his head is cradled in my lap . I start desperately smoothing my hands over his bearded face , noticing his hand still swollen and bruised , with dried blood all over his knuckles . ‘
5846	5884	5885	5885	Jesse	431	’ I plead , giving into hysteria as I look at the man I love , unconscious and non - responsive , lying in my lap . Tears pour down my face and spill onto his cheeks . ‘
5889	5926	5927	5928	Mother fucker	315	’ I desperately run my hands over his face , his chest , his hair . He looks hollow , he ’s lost weight and his jaw is covered in a week ’s worth of stubble . ‘
5930	5947	5927	5928	Mother fucker	315	’ John rumbles when he finds me on the terrace with Jesse supported in my lap . ‘
5957	6016	5927	5928	Mother fucker	315	’ I sob , looking up through glazed eyes to the mountain of a man stalking towards me . Why have n’t I checked this yet ? It ’s the first rule in first aid . I grab his wrist , but my shaking hands wo n’t allow me to maintain a stable hold to establish a pulse . ‘
6019	6047	5927	5928	Mother fucker	315	’ John gestures , kneeling down and taking Jesse ’s arm from me . I look up and see Sam skid to a halt at the door . ‘
6051	6085	6086	6086	I	363	’ Tears are invading me eyes uncontrollably and everything has gone into slow motion . Sam makes his way over and lowers himself down next to me . He starts rubbing my arm . ‘
6092	6108	6086	6086	I	363	’ Drew says urgently as he finds us all crowded around Jesse ’s motionless form . ‘
6112	6135	6136	6139	The stupid mother fucker	317	’ John barks harshly , leaning over Jesse and pulling his dried lips apart , inspecting every part of his limp body . ‘
6150	6191	6141	6141	He	317	’ I look at Sam and Drew , but I ca n’t fathom their reactions to John ’s conclusion . How does he know this ? He could be half dead for all John knows . He certainly looks it . ‘
6200	6242	6192	6192	I	363	’ I push between sniffles . John looks at me sympathetically . I ’ve never seen anything but a completely impassive expression on his hard face , so the way he is looking at me now , all sorrowful and like I ’m
6251	6293	6294	6294	John	564	‘ Ava , girl . I ’ve seen him like this , more than once . He needs his bed and some care to get him through this . He does n’t need a doctor . Not that sort , anyway . ’
6404	6411	6412	6412	Sam	564	‘ What happened to his hand ? ’
6433	6442	6443	6443	I	363	‘ He smashed the window on his car , ’
6453	6461	6462	6462	I	363	‘ When we rowed at Kate ’s . ’
6468	6477	6478	6478	Drew	68	‘ Should we get him into his bed ? ’
6482	6485	6486	6486	John	564	‘ Sofa . ’
6490	6553	6554	6554	Jesse	431	’re back to a few words . I watch as Sam gets up and collects an empty vodka bottle from under the sun lounger . He looks at it in complete disgust and dramatically smashes it on the side of a raised planter . I flinch at the loud noise that echoes around us , but more significantly , Jesse flinches too . ‘
6556	6562	6563	6563	Jesse	431	’ I shake him slightly . ‘
6571	6636	6637	6637	He	431	’ Sam , Drew and John all crowd around us and Jesse ’s arm starts to rise above his head , flapping around in thin air . I clasp it and place it back by his side , but no sooner have I released it , he brings it back up in front of my face , mumbling inaudibly and thrashing his legs about . ‘
6645	6780	6637	6637	He	431	’ John says quietly . I throw a shocked glance at John , and he nods at me . He ’s looking for me ? I reach for his hand again and guide it to my face , spreading his palm against my cheek . He instantly calms . His cold palm on my face offers me little comfort , but it seems to soothe him , so I hold it there and let him feel me , horrified that he has , quite possibly , been out here on the terrace for days , unclothed and unconscious . It might be mild in the May daytime , but nightfall brings cooler temperatures . Why did I walk out on him ? I should have stayed and calmed him down , not walk away . ‘
6791	6801	6637	6637	He	431	’ Drew says , heading back into the penthouse . ‘
6805	6886	6803	6803	we	326	’ John prompts , nodding at Jesse on the floor . I reluctantly release Jesse ’s hand and let Sam and John flank him on either side to coordinate a lift . As he ’s lifted from my lap , I pull myself up and run ahead to make sure their path is clear . I free the entire leather corner couch of a million cushions – all courtesy of me – so it looks more like a bed when I ’m
7033	7040	7029	7029	I	363	‘ Ava , are you okay ? ’
7073	7075	7060	7060	I	363	‘ I ’m
7080	7081	7060	7060	I	363	’ ‘
7086	7132	7133	7133	Ava	0	’ Sam sighs . I lean over Jesse and rest my lips on his forehead , leaving them to linger for a few seconds , and as I lift myself from the floor , his arm shoots out from under the blanket and grabs me . ‘

7182	7228	7229	7229	I	363	’ I place my hand over his on my arm . He tries to lift his head from the pillow , but I do n’t have to reprimand him . Before I have a chance to push him back down , he gives up trying . ‘
7230	7234	7235	7235	he	363	’m so sorry . ’
7255	7257	7260	7260	I	363	‘ I ’m
7261	7265	7268	7268	I	363	’m sorry , I ’m
7269	7273	7268	7268	I	363	’m sorry , I ’m
7276	7277	7268	7268	I	363	’ ‘
7280	7296	7268	7268	I	363	’ I whisper on a quivering voice , helping his hand to reach my face . ‘
7302	7389	7268	7268	I	363	’ I turn my lips into his hand and kiss his palm and when I turn to face him again , his eyes are closed . He ’s gone again . I take his hand and place it on the blanket , then make sure he is tucked in well , before pulling myself up and turning to see Sam , Drew and John , all standing silently watching me tend to him . I had completely forgotten I was n’t alone with Jesse , but I ’m
7397	7404	7405	7405	Sam	564	‘ I ’ll make some coffee . ’
7506	7513	7499	7499	Jesse	431	‘ I ’ve got to shoot , ’
7524	7526	7514	7514	Drew	68	‘ I ’m
7531	7538	7539	7539	You	331	’ He looks a little embarrassed . ‘
7544	7554	7539	7539	You	331	’ Sam pushes as he hunts for the mugs . ‘
7561	7562	7555	7555	I	363	’ ‘
7572	7593	7555	7555	I	363	’ I give Sam the directions to the mugs and he turns , looking at me quizzically . I shrug . ‘
7605	7651	7652	7652	We	332	’ Drew says . I offer a small smile and John does his signature nod as Drew leaves us to it and Sam finishes the coffees . He transports three mugs of black coffee to the island where John and I have taken our seats . ‘
7671	7709	7652	7652	We	332	’ Sam asks . I nod and help myself , John following suit , putting an incredible four sugars into his coffee . I know there is no milk , but it would be pointless sharing this . ‘
7712	7716	7652	7652	We	332	’ Sam begins . ‘
7732	7817	7652	7652	We	332	’ he jokes . Carefree Sam is back and it ’s quite a relief . Seeing him so fraught had only fuelled my own worry , and as it turns out , he had every reason to be anxious . I inwardly shudder at the thought of Jesse alone and suffering for the last five days . How much longer would he have been lying there if I had refused to come ? They would have surely phoned the police . John pipes up . ‘
7848	7849	7835	7835	He	333	’ ‘
7859	7863	7852	7852	he	333	’ I ask . ‘
7872	7927	7867	7867	I	363	’ I have no idea how these things work . John shakes his head and puts his glasses back on , and I start to wonder about his relationship with Jesse . I thought he was just an employee , but he seems to be the one in the know about all of this . ‘
7931	7936	7937	7937	He	333	’ John states firmly . ‘
7981	7989	7976	7976	he	333	’ He offers me a small smile . ‘
7995	7996	7990	7990	You	66	’ ‘
8002	8062	7999	7999	I	363	’ I ask defensively . I do n’t know why I sound so hurt by John ’s statement . He has just told me I helped the situation , but I ca n’t help feeling like he ’s insinuating that I might have helped with the relapse as well . Sam places his hand over mine on the worktop . ‘
8069	8070	7999	7999	I	363	’ ‘
8077	8083	8073	8073	I	363	’ I say quietly . I ’m

8151	8158	8146	8146	Sam	564	‘ You were n’t to know . ’
8159	8165	8166	8166	I	363	‘ He never told me , ’
8169	8181	8182	8182	I	363	‘ If I had known , things would have been different . ’
8183	8189	8182	8182	I	363	’m still defending myself . I ’m
8307	8310	8311	8311	John	564	‘ Ava ? ’
8321	8328	8311	8311	John	564	‘ He ’s a good man . ’
8329	8340	8341	8341	I	363	‘ What made him drink ? How bad is it ? ’
8364	8368	8369	8369	John	564	‘ Who knows ? ’
8378	8415	8369	8369	John	564	‘ Do n’t be thinking he was smashed all day every day . He was n’t . How he is right now , that ’s just because of misery , not because he ’s an alcoholic . ’
8416	8427	8428	8428	I	363	‘ And he did n’t drink when I turned up ? ’
8437	8457	8434	8434	John	564	‘ He did n’t , although you have brought out some other rather nasty qualities in him , girl . ’
8565	8592	8593	8593	I	363	‘ I ’ll stay , but if he comes round and he does n’t want me here , I will be calling one of you two . ’
8600	8608	8609	8609	John	564	‘ That wo n’t happen , Ava . ’
8612	8630	8631	8631	He	564	‘ I need to get myself back to The Manor and run that mother fucker ’s business . ’
8639	8652	8631	8631	He	564	‘ Ava , you need my number . Where ’s your phone ? ’
8729	8827	8728	8728	I	363	’m supposed to do . I stand silently watching him , his lashes flickering mildly , his chest rising and falling steadily . Even unconscious he looks troubled . I approach quietly and pull the blanket up to his chin . I ca n’t help it . I ’ve never looked after him before , but it ’s instinctive . I kneel and rest my lips on his cold cheek , soaking up the little bit of comfort I get from the contact before standing and making my way back to the kitchen . John has gone . ‘
8830	8839	8840	8840	John	564	’ Sam passes me a piece of paper . ‘
8844	8845	8847	8847	he	564	’ ‘
8852	8863	8864	8864	He	564	’ I ask . He could have waited for me . ‘
8890	8891	8881	8881	She	347	’ ‘
8896	8922	8881	8881	She	347	’ My poor clothes are going to wonder where they live . They have been transported back and forth to this place on numerous occasions . ‘
8928	8933	8926	8926	Ava	0	’ Sam says sincerely . ‘
8939	8958	8926	8926	Ava	0	’ I protest , feeling uncomfortable , especially since this is partly my fault . Sam shuffles nervously . ‘
8977	8978	8982	8982	Sam	564	’ ‘
8984	8985	8982	8982	Sam	564	’ ‘
8994	8999	9000	9000	He	564	’ Sam laughs lightly . ‘
9020	9089	9008	9008	He	564	’ I imagine he will be . The Jesse I know is strong , confident , domineering and a whole heap of other things . Weak and helpless are not included in the long list of Jesse ’s attributes . I want to tell Sam that The Manor and its activities have been diluted by this drink issue , but it has n’t . Not really . Now I ’m
9219	9357	9218	9218	I	363	’m staggered by how much he has loaded up in there ; he must have bought a whole crate of the stuff . It ’s obvious he planned on being here alone with his vodka for quite a while . I do know one thing , though ; I wo n’t be drinking it ever again . Clive rings up to tell me that a young lady is in the foyer by the name of Kate , and after I ’ve advised Clive of what we ’ve found , we go down to meet her , each dragging a black bin bag full of rubbish and empty bottles . I make a mental note to sort the mangled door out . When we arrive in the foyer , Kate is waiting under the close observation of Clive . ‘
9360	9376	9379	9379	he	355	’ she says cautiously as we approach , dragging the clanging bin bags with us . ‘
9381	9404	9379	9379	he	355	’ I release the bag , causing more clanging , and give Clive the eyeball , just to let him know that I ’m
9448	9453	9440	9440	He	431	‘ He ’s asleep . ’
9463	9501	9462	9462	I	363	’m too busy making Clive feel guilty . When I turn my attention back to Kate , I see Sam slip his free arm around her and give her a hug . She bats him away playfully . ‘
9504	9525	9462	9462	I	363	’ Kate passes me my overnight bag . This thing is like a yoyo between Kate ’s house and Lusso . ‘
9535	9536	9526	9526	I	363	’ ‘
9539	9545	9548	9548	you	363	’ I take the bag . ‘
9549	9554	9555	9555	she	359	’re staying here then ? ’
9558	9561	9562	9562	I	363	‘ Yeah , ’
9582	9590	9591	9591	Kate	431	‘ How long are you staying for ? ’
9665	9691	9692	9692	I	363	’m suddenly aware that I ’ve left Jesse upstairs and I start to panic . He might wake up and no one will be there . ‘
9699	9709	9692	9692	I	363	’ I say , looking back towards the elevators . ‘
9715	9731	9732	9732	We	361	’ Kate shoos me with her hand and takes the bin bag from the floor . ‘
9739	9851	9732	9732	We	361	’ We say our goodbyes and I promise to call her in the morning before I head back to the elevator , instructing Clive to sort out Jesse ’s car window and the door to his penthouse on my way . He , of course , gets straight onto it . When I arrive back on the top floor , I shut the door , but it does n’t secure fully . It will do until the repair man turns up , though . I wander into the living room and see Jesse still asleep . So , what do I do now ? I look down my body and note I ’m
9880	10021	9879	9879	I	363	’m staggered to find all of the pillows on the floor and the bed sheets crumpled from my brief lay down before Jesse transported me back to his bed after the dress massacre . I set about fixing the bed and then change into my ripped jeans and a black t - shirt . I could do with a shower , but I do n’t want to leave Jesse alone for too long . It ’ll have to wait . Making my way back downstairs , I make a black coffee and as I stand sipping it in the kitchen , I figure it would be a good idea to read up on alcoholism . Jesse must have a computer somewhere . I go in search , finding a laptop in his study . I fire it up , and I ’m
10076	10123	10125	10125	myself	363	’m presented with seventeen million results . At the top of the page , though , is “ Alcoholics Anonymous ” . That would be a good place to start , I suppose . John might have said that Jesse is n’t an alcoholic , but I ’m
10224	10274	10280	10280	Ava	0	’m bombarded with information , and I do n’t know what to do with any of it . These are not the sort of questions you just come right out and ask . My mind flicks back to last Sunday and the things he said to me . “ You ’re
10380	10462	10379	10379	I	363	’m totally spent . I do n’t want to go upstairs to bed in case he wakes up and I do n’t want to make myself comfortable , so I gather a few cushions up , lay them on the floor next to him and settle myself , resting my head on the sofa and stroking the hairs on his toned arms . It relaxes me to have the contact and it ’s not long before my eyes are heavy and I ’m
10468	10473	10474	10474	I	363	‘ I love you . ’
10475	10510	10474	10474	I	363	’m vaguely aware of his palm holding the back of my head , his fingers running through my hair , and it feels so comforting … so right . I open my eyes and I ’m
10538	10541	10542	10542	I	363	‘ Shit ! ’
10545	10550	10551	10551	he	363	‘ Watch your mouth ! ’
10606	10608	10602	10602	he	363	‘ You ’re
10611	10678	10684	10684	he	363	’ I cry . He winces , clasping his head with his good hand . Oh shit ! He must have the hangover from hell and here I am screeching like a banshee . I walk back the few steps needed to find the chair behind me , and then lower myself onto the seat . I have no idea what to say to him . I ’m
10695	10821	10826	10826	he	369	’m not going to hit him with a lecture about personal safety or for disregarding his health . I really want to ask him if he remembers our fight . What should I do ? I do n’t know , so I resolve to sit with my hands in my lap and shut up . I look at him , looking at me and my mind is racing with things I want to say , none of which I can . I want to tell him that I love him , for a start . And I want to ask him why he did n’t tell me he owns a sex club or that he has an issue with drink . Is he wondering what I ’m
10848	10854	10855	10855	I	363	‘ How are you feeling ? ’
10875	10878	10879	10879	he	369	‘ Shit . ’
10975	10981	10982	10982	he	369	‘ Where are you going ? ’
10994	11003	10982	10982	he	369	‘ I thought you might need some water . ’
11076	11255	11075	11075	I	363	’m disappointed . He settles at my response , and I carry on my way to the kitchen , glancing at the clock on the oven as I fetch a glass . Eight o’clock . I ’ve slept for ten hours straight . That has n’t happened since … well , since I was last with Jesse . I grab a bottle of water from the fridge and fill the glass before traipsing back into the vast open space to find Jesse sat up on the sofa with his head in his hands , the blanket pooling in his lap . When I reach him , he lifts his gaze to mine and our eyes lock . I hand him the water . With his good hand , he takes the glass , his fingers resting over mine . I retract mine quickly , the water splashing out of the glass . I do n’t know why that happened , and the look on his face makes me feel instantly heartless . He ’s shaking dreadfully , and I ’m
11263	11313	11262	11262	I	363	’m sure I read shakiness as a symptom , along with a catalogue of other signs . He follows my eyes to his hand and shakes his head . This is weird . Things have never been like this between us . Neither of us knows what to say . ‘
11322	11365	11366	11366	I	363	’ I ask . This is pink elephant in the room territory , but I ’ve got to say something . He sips his water and then slumps back on the sofa , his abdominals looking sharper from his slight weight loss . ‘
11376	11377	11366	11366	I	363	’ ‘
11380	11381	11366	11366	I	363	’ ‘
11384	11391	11366	11366	I	363	’ he asks , obviously shocked . ‘
11394	11396	11366	11366	I	363	’ I ’m
11547	11612	11613	11613	Jesse	431	’m not sure I really want to either . This man is not the man I fell in love with . Is this the real Jesse ? He sits and fiddles with his glass thoughtfully , the familiar sight of the cogs turning is comforting , it ’s a little piece of him that I recognise , but I ca n’t bear this silence . ‘
11622	11642	11613	11613	Jesse	431	’ I ask despairingly , while silently pleading for him to give me something – anything . He sighs . ‘
11666	11720	11655	11655	I	363	’ He does n’t look at me . I want to scream at him , tell him what he ’s done to me . Sat here looking at him , all disheveled and tracing the rim of his glass , is just reinforcing the sensible side of my brain ’s instinct to run . ‘
11727	11752	11722	11722	you	375	’ I ask . I ca n’t sit in silence anymore . I ’ll tear my hair out . He leans forward and winces . ‘
11755	11792	11722	11722	you	375	’ he murmurs . I watch him struggle to his feet , and I feel like a cold cow for not helping him , but I do n’t know if he wants me to , and I ’m
11826	11829	11830	11830	he	363	‘ Shit . ’
11853	11855	11842	11842	He	363	‘ I ’m
11858	11934	11842	11842	He	363	’ he says on a shrug . Sorry ? Like I have n’t seen it all before – lots , in fact . In his words , there is not a place on my body that has n’t had him in it , on it or over it . My shoulders droop and I sigh as I start walking with him up the stairs to the master - suite . It takes a while and we ’re
11972	11979	11971	11971	I	363	’m used to with this man . ‘
11986	12033	12034	12034	I	363	’ I ask , walking ahead into the bathroom . He looks exhausted after his trek up the stairs , so standing in the shower is n’t going to be fun . A good muscle soak in the bath will probably help . He shrugs again . ‘
12037	12050	12034	12034	I	363	’ Okay , I ’ll run him a bath , and then I ’m
12082	12112	12081	12081	I	363	’m destroyed to discover that I do n’t know him at all – not even a little bit . I ’ll ring John and see what he suggests . I ’m
12204	12347	12203	12203	I	363	’m in there with him . I push the button for the plug and let the water run , knowing the giant thing will take an age to fill . I turn and come face to face with the vanity unit . That is where we had our first sexual encounter . This bathroom is where we showered together , bathed together and had many steamy sex sessions together . It ’s also where I last saw him . Stop ! I shake my thoughts away and busy myself finding some bath soak and generally pottering about , while Jesse stands propped up against the wall in silence . As I knew it would , the bath takes forever to fill , and I begin to wish I had just shoved him in the shower . Finally , it ’s full enough . ‘
12350	12401	12402	12402	You	363	’ I say shortly , walking out of the bathroom . I ’ve never felt compelled to escape his presence . I ’ve stormed off in strops and evaded his touch for fear of losing my mind , but I ’ve never really wanted to leave . I do now . ‘
12403	12409	12410	12410	he	363	’re acting like a stranger . ’
12439	12446	12433	12433	I	363	‘ I feel like a stranger . ’
12587	12595	12596	12596	My	363	‘ Please look at me , Ava . ’
12690	12697	12681	12681	he	363	‘ I ca n’t do this . ’
12722	12725	12728	12728	him	363	‘ Ava ! ’
12824	12827	12812	12812	I	363	‘ No ! ’
12841	12847	12828	12828	I	363	‘ Do n’t touch me ! ’
12848	12856	12857	12857	he	363	‘ Ava , do n’t do this . ’
12872	12875	12857	12857	he	363	‘ Stop ! ’
12888	12905	12887	12887	I	363	’m already broken , but he can dish the final blow that will finish me off . ‘
12911	12915	12887	12887	I	363	’ I sob . ‘
12924	12963	12964	12964	I	363	’ He collapses to the floor with me , pulling me onto his lap and smothering me completely . I sob relentlessly into his chest . I ca n’t control it . His face pushes into my hair . ‘
12965	12968	12969	12969	he	363	’m sorry , ’
12972	12974	12969	12969	he	363	‘ I ’m
12992	12998	12999	12999	I	363	’ He squeezes me hard . ‘
13004	13005	12999	12999	I	363	’ ‘
13014	13016	13006	13006	I	363	’ I ’m
13120	13131	13119	13119	I	363	’m delirious . This is the furthest away from that man ‘
13140	13255	13119	13119	I	363	’ he begs , holding me tight . I notice his shakes have subsided . I pull back , wiping my tear stained face with the back of my hand , my eyes fixed on his stomach , his scar bigger and more obvious than ever before . I ca n’t look at his eyes . They are not familiar to me anymore . They are not dark with anger or sparkling with pleasure – not narrowed fiercely or hooded with lust for me . They are empty pits of nothing , with no comfort to offer me . Despite that , though , I know if I walk out of that door , I ’m
13302	13304	13287	13287	His	390	‘ I ’m
13313	13322	13312	13312	I	363	’m going to make you remember , Ava . ’
13355	13365	13366	13366	I	363	‘ Can you make me remember the conventional way ? ’
13382	13384	13377	13377	he	390	‘ I ’m
13396	13492	13493	13493	Your	391	’ His words , a repeat from the launch night of Lusso , are spoken with as much resolve as they were back then . He kept his promise to prove that I wanted him . A small flicker of hope lightens my heavy heart , and I sink my face back down into his chest , clinging onto him . I believe him . A quiet exhale of breath escapes his lips as he pulls me closer and holds on like his life depends on it . It probably does . And mine too . ‘
13499	13508	13493	13493	Your	391	’ I mumble into his bare chest when we ’re
13522	13524	13493	13493	Your	391	‘ I ’m
13527	13543	13544	13544	You	391	’ he complains , and I detect a familiar piece of Jesse in his tone . ‘
13551	13564	13544	13544	You	391	’ I inform him , feeling strange dishing out instructions to him . ‘
13576	13577	13544	13544	You	391	’ ‘
13581	13586	13544	13544	You	391	’ he confirms . I ’m
13616	13620	13621	13621	I	363	‘ Come on . ’
13681	13686	13667	13667	We	392	‘ In you get . ’

13715	13721	13707	13707	He	363	‘ It sounds like it , ’
13743	13751	13752	13752	he	363	‘ Will you get in with me ? ’
13765	13770	13756	13756	I	363	‘ I ca n’t . ’

13869	13906	13909	13909	I	363	’ He ’s right , but I ca n’t allow myself to get swallowed up by him . I need to keep a level head because as soon as he gets his hands on me , I ’m
13977	13990	13991	13991	he	431	‘ It ’s not the same without you in here with me . ’
14138	14144	14129	14129	I	363	‘ You need a shave . ’
14162	14169	14145	14145	He	431	‘ You do n’t like it ? ’
14170	14178	14145	14145	He	431	‘ I like you however you come . ’
14212	14214	14203	14203	he	431	‘ I ’m
14221	14238	14239	14239	You	396	’ he declares confidently , ensuring he maintains our eye contact as he makes his vow . ‘
14243	14248	14249	14249	I	363	’ I retort quietly . ‘
14252	14283	14284	14284	I	363	’ He sits himself up in the bath and turns to face me , lifting his battered hand to cup my face and wincing when he realises he ca n’t . ‘
14295	14301	14302	14302	I	363	’ He sounds so sincere . ‘
14303	14359	14302	14302	I	363	’m not a raving alcoholic , Ava . I admit I get carried away once I do have a drink and I find it hard to stop , but I can take it or leave it . I was in a bad place after you left me . I just wanted to numb the pain . ’
14395	14400	14380	14380	Everyone	2502	‘ I came back , ’
14438	14464	14465	14465	His	2502	‘ Why did n’t you tell me sooner ? Is this what you meant when you said I would cause more damage if I left ? ’
14469	14478	14465	14465	His	2502	‘ That was a shitty thing to say . ’
14479	14483	14484	14484	He	2502	‘ It was . ’
14491	14513	14514	14514	He	2502	‘ I just wanted you to stay . I was stunned when you told me that I had a nice hotel . ’
14524	14557	14558	14558	He	2502	‘ Things got pretty intense , pretty quickly . I did n’t know how to tell you . I did n’t want you to run away again . You kept running away . ’
14592	14608	14583	14583	I	363	‘ I did n’t get far , did I ? You would n’t let me . ’
14609	14636	14583	14583	I	363	‘ I was going to tell you . You were n’t supposed to come to The Manor like that . I was n’t prepared , Ava . ’
14666	14767	14665	14665	I	363	’m sure people were warned off talking to me and no one approached Jesse when I was with him . And he ’s right , things did get pretty intense , pretty quickly , but that was nothing to do with me . God , there is so much to talk about . I need to know things and he has got to tell me . The nasty little creature who Jesse pounded on at The Manor had some pretty interesting things to say . Has Jesse had an affair with his wife ? So many questions . I sigh . ‘
14772	14775	14776	14776	I	363	’re pruning . ’
14838	14850	14851	14851	he	363	‘ A few weeks ago , I was nursing your hangover . ’
14855	14869	14851	14851	he	363	‘ I bet your head is banging a lot harder than mine was . ’
14882	14889	14870	14870	I	363	‘ Food and then the hospital . ’
14890	14893	14894	14894	he	363	‘ Hospital ? ’
14901	14911	14894	14894	he	363	‘ I do n’t need a hospital , Ava . ’
14912	14916	14917	14917	I	363	‘ Your hand . ’
14959	14964	14965	14965	he	363	‘ It ’s fine . ’
14968	14976	14977	14977	I	363	‘ I do n’t think it is . ’
14981	14994	14977	14977	I	363	‘ Ava , I do n’t need to go to the hospital . ’
14995	15001	15002	15002	I	363	‘ Do n’t go then . ’
15103	15110	15093	15093	I	363	‘ Here , put these on . ’
15237	15373	15236	15236	I	363	’m halfway up his body and I come face to face with his huge arousal . I release his boxers and jump back from him , like it might burn me or something . Not all of him is broken then , I think to myself , trying to ignore the steel rod of flesh within touching distance . I flick a glance up to him and for the first time , his eyes sparkle fully , but it ’s not a good thing . I ’ve seen that look , more than once , heaps in fact , and it ’s not what I need right now , although my body is completely disagreeing with my brain . I struggle to control the urge to push him on the bed and straddle him . I ’m
15405	15413	15414	15414	he	406	‘ I ’ll go to the hospital . ’
15417	15429	15414	15414	he	406	‘ If you want me to , then I ’ll go . ’
15435	15454	15455	15455	I	363	‘ Agreeing to have your hand looked at wo n’t make me fall to your feet in gratitude . ’
15467	15474	15459	15459	His	406	‘ I ’ll let that slip . ’
15475	15482	15483	15483	I	363	‘ I need to feed you . ’
15622	15627	15614	15614	I	363	‘ You have nothing . ’
15681	15689	15690	15690	I	363	‘ I ’ll go to the supermarket . ’
15711	15716	15703	15703	He	431	‘ I ’ll come . ’
15717	15720	15721	15721	I	363	‘ Okay . ’
15727	15736	15737	15737	he	431	‘ I ’ll come because I want to . ’
15747	15750	15741	15741	I	363	‘ Okay . ’
15751	15760	15761	15761	His	431	‘ Ava , will you look at me ? ’
15798	15804	15788	15788	he	431	‘ I ’ll get ready . ’
15920	16030	15919	15919	I	363	’m done . I present myself to the mirror , but I do n’t look much better after my attempts to make myself appear better . My eyes are probably matching Jesse ’s on the hollow scale and the empty feeling that ’s been lingering since last Sunday has not been filled by Jesse ’s presence . Maybe I ’ve got all of this wrong . Maybe I am better walking away because I certainly do n’t feel any better for being here . I sigh at my reflection , willing it to give me some answers , but I know the only place I can find the answers I ’m
16148	16156	16157	16157	Ava	0	’m supposed to be seeing him today . ‘

16239	16242	16243	16243	he	62	‘ Worried , ’
16253	16259	16243	16243	he	62	‘ They need n’t be . ’
16260	16276	16281	16281	I	363	‘ Yeah , well , they are . And me too . Where are you ? ’
16296	16300	16301	16301	I	363	‘ Kate ’s , ’
16328	16337	16339	16339	she	419	’m supposed to be at Kate ’s and I ’m

16456	16501	16455	16455	I	363	’m in love with – to wake up so I can take him to the hospital and get his hand seen to – the one that he put through a window because I pissed him off . I start pacing around the kitchen island . ‘
16512	16524	16531	16531	he	426	’ he asks . The spite in his voice is palpable . ‘
16548	16549	16550	16551	Fucking prick	427	’ ‘
16594	16595	16596	16596	I	363	’ ‘
16599	16604	16596	16596	I	363	’ I defend myself . ‘
16626	16639	16640	16640	Dan	62	’ I freeze mid - pace . That ’s a good question . ‘
16653	16654	16640	16640	Dan	62	’ ‘
16664	16669	16671	16671	I	363	’ he says firmly . ‘
16673	16738	16671	16671	I	363	’ I blurt . I highly doubt that . Big brother would probably join my Dad in the heart attack ward . This is the reason I did n’t go to Newquay ; interrogation and nagging . I will have to face up to it eventually , but not now . I ’ve never been so glad that my parents live so far away . ‘
16752	16769	16671	16671	I	363	’ he asks , chirping up a little . See me or squeeze me for information ? ‘
16772	16776	16671	16671	I	363	’ I try . ‘
16784	16807	16808	16808	I	363	’ He sounds so disappointed . So am I. I really want to see him , but I really do n’t too . ‘
16809	16813	16808	16808	I	363	’m sorry . I ’m
16833	16891	16824	16824	I	363	’ I lie again , but I could n’t possibly muster up the strength to appear reasonably normal in such a short space of time . Maybe by tomorrow I ’ll have dragged myself out of my hole of depression and uncertainty . I very much doubt it , but at least I have time to try . ‘
16902	16916	16894	16894	we	432	’ he confirms my fears . A whole day of evading his questions ? ‘
16925	16957	16894	16894	we	432	’ I say , and secretly hope he goes out with all of his mates tonight and suffers a dreadful hangover which delays his call to me . I need time . ‘
16967	17017	17018	17018	Ava	0	’ He hangs up . I start thinking of ways to get around this and after an hour of aimless pacing around the penthouse , I come up with none . I ca n’t avoid him forever . The intercom phone system chimes and I answer it to Clive . ‘
17044	17045	17036	17037	Mr Ward	340	’ ‘
17051	17077	17049	17049	Clive	76	’ I hang up and make my way to the door . I answer to an old boy , who is already inspecting the damage . ‘
17087	17095	17085	17085	you	433	’ he asks , scratching his head . ‘
17100	17104	17085	17085	you	433	’ I mutter . ‘
17132	17144	17118	17118	I	363	’ he says , placing his tool box on the floor . ‘
17147	17173	17118	17118	I	363	’ I leave him chipping chunks of splintered wood off the doorframe and turn to find Jesse half asleep , looking suspiciously at the door . ‘
17179	17183	17184	17184	John	564	’ he asks . ‘
17199	17216	17220	17220	him	564	’ I inform him dryly . His eyebrows shoot up , but then he looks worried . ‘
17222	17223	17217	17217	I	363	’ ‘
17229	17249	17252	17252	You	564	’ I ask , assessing him and concluding that he looks a bit brighter after an hour power napping . ‘
17254	17255	17252	17252	You	564	’ ‘
17264	17283	17284	17284	Ava	0	’ I sidestep him and make my way past . His hand flies out and grabs my arm . ‘
17286	17365	17284	17284	Ava	0	’ I halt and wait for a follow up , any words that are going to make this all better , but I get nothing , just his heat seeping into my flesh from his harsh grip of my arm . I look up at him and find him watching me , but he still does n’t open his mouth . I sigh heavily and pull myself free , but then I remember my car is n’t here . ‘
17368	17373	17284	17284	Ava	0	’ I curse quietly . ‘
17384	17385	17386	17386	My	363	’ ‘
17393	17394	17395	17395	We	437	’ ‘
17400	17401	17395	17395	We	437	’ ‘
17409	17430	17431	17431	I	363	’ I turn to face him . His driving scares the shit out of me at the best of times . ‘
17438	17471	17472	17472	Ava	0	’ He tosses his keys at me , and I panic slightly . He trusts me to drive a car worth more than one hundred and sixty thousand pounds ? Holy shit ! ‘
17475	17488	17489	17489	Jesse	431	’re driving like Miss Daisy . Will you put your foot down ? ’
17520	17525	17519	17519	I	363	’m scared to death I ’m
17531	17535	17536	17536	I	363	‘ Shut up . ’
17543	17563	17542	17542	I	363	’m told and roaring off down the road . It ’s his tough shit if I do bump someone . ‘
17568	17576	17542	17542	I	363	’ He looks at me and smiles . ‘
17584	17593	17594	17594	I	363	’re not pussy footing around on the power . ’
17610	17664	17609	17609	I	363	’m not telling him so . Instead , I concentrate on the road and getting him to the hospital in one piece . After three hours in Minor Injuries and an x - ray , the doctor has confirmed that Jesse ’s hand is not broken , but he has some muscle damage . ‘
17671	17676	17609	17609	I	363	’ The nurse asks , ‘
17701	17717	17690	17690	I	363	’ Jesse looks at me guiltily as the nurse wraps his hand in a bandage . ‘
17720	17737	17738	17738	You	0	’ he says quietly . No , he ’s been clenching bottles of vodka in it . ‘
17743	17748	17738	17738	You	0	’ she reprimands him , ‘
17755	17802	17738	17738	You	0	’ I raise my eyebrows at him and he rolls his eyes while the nurse puts his arm in a sling before sending us on our way . As we get to the entrance , he removes the sling and chucks it in the litter bin . ‘
17808	17821	17822	17822	I	363	’ I gasp , watching him walk out of the hospital doors . ‘
17823	17829	17822	17822	I	363	’m not wearing that thing . ’
17830	17835	17836	17836	I	363	‘ You bloody are ! ’
17847	17904	17846	17846	I	363	’m shocked . This man has no regard for the wellbeing of his body . He has assaulted his internal organs with gallons of vodka , and now refuses to co - operate so his hand heals properly ? I stalk after him , but he does n’t stop until he gets to the car . I ’m
17930	17939	17940	17940	he	363	‘ Are you going to open the car ? ’
17943	17954	17955	17955	I	363	‘ No , not until you put this back on . ’
17963	17971	17955	17955	I	363	‘ I told you , Ava . I ’m
17976	17988	17955	17955	I	363	’ I roll my eyes before narrowing them back on him . ‘
17991	18006	17955	17955	I	363	’ I ask shortly . The stubborn Jesse is back , but this trait I ’m
18013	18020	17955	17955	I	363	‘ I do n’t need it . ’
18021	18027	18036	18036	he	363	‘ Yes , you do . ’
18028	18035	18036	18036	he	363	‘ No , I do n’t . ’
18042	18051	18052	18052	I	363	‘ Put the fucking sling on , Jesse ! ’
18058	18064	18052	18052	I	363	‘ Watch your fucking mouth ! ’
18065	18068	18069	18069	I	363	‘ Fuck ! ’
18120	18123	18124	18124	he	363	‘ MOUTH ! ’
18148	18151	18152	18152	I	363	‘ FUCK ! ’
18181	18189	18190	18190	he	363	‘ Open the fucking car , Ava . ’
18209	18215	18216	18216	I	363	‘ How ’s your hand ? ’
18260	18263	18264	18264	he	363	‘ Open , ’
18267	18270	18271	18271	I	363	‘ Sling , ’
18298	18301	18280	18280	He	363	‘ Open ! ’
18302	18304	18305	18306	a child	446	‘ You ’re
18325	18346	18312	18312	I	363	’ I watch as his eyes narrow on me and the edges of his mouth lift into a concealed grin . ‘
18349	18362	18363	18363	You	447	’ he says , loud and clear . My jaw hits ground . ‘
18371	18376	18363	18363	You	447	’ I screech disbelievingly . ‘
18379	18389	18363	18363	You	447	’ His tone is cool and casual , while I ’m
18400	18403	18392	18392	He	363	‘ One , ’
18404	18410	18411	18411	I	363	‘ You can get stuffed ! ’
18444	18447	18448	18448	he	363	‘ Zero , ’
18478	18484	18485	18485	he	363	‘ What are you doing ? ’
18548	18551	18552	18552	I	363	‘ Nothing , ’
18574	18578	18579	18579	His	363	‘ Come here . ’
18603	18612	18602	18602	I	363	’m being distracted . I shake my head . ‘
18615	18755	18756	18756	Jesse	431	’ Before I can anticipate his next move , he breaks into a full sprint around the car , and I dash off in the opposite direction on a squeal . People are staring as I weave myself through the other parked cars in the car park like a deranged madwoman , before I skid to a stop at the back of a high top , four wheel drive . I peek around the corner to see where he is . My heart falls out of my mouth , straight on to the tarmac . He ’s doubled over , his hands braced on his knees . Shit ! What the hell am I doing encouraging such stupid behaviour when he should be recuperating ? I run towards him as a few passersby clock him and start to approach . ‘
18758	18765	18767	18767	he	431	’ I shout as I near . ‘
18773	18786	18787	18787	I	363	’ An old boy asks me as I make it to him . ‘

18880	18891	18892	18892	My	363	’m just happy he has the strength to lift me . ‘
18897	18913	18916	18916	they	2502	’ I complain as I reach around to smooth my full dress over my bum . ‘
18917	18920	18921	18921	He	431	’re not . ’
18984	18993	18978	18978	I	363	‘ We need to go to the supermarket . ’
19020	19033	19010	19010	He	431	‘ How can I fix things if you keep dodging my attempts ? ’
19046	19084	19034	19034	I	363	‘ That ’s your problem , Jesse . You want to fix things by distracting me with your touch instead of talking to me and giving me some answers . I ca n’t let that happen again . ’

19210	19219	19220	19220	I	363	‘ That ’s a parent and child space . ’
19226	19229	19220	19220	I	363	‘ So , ’
19230	19249	19250	19250	He	431	‘ So … I do n’t see any child in this lovely car of yours . Do you ? ’
19265	19272	19273	19273	he	431	‘ Did you find your pills ? ’
19283	19286	19287	19287	I	363	‘ No , ’
19385	19391	19392	19392	he	431	‘ Did you miss any ? ’
19411	19419	19420	19420	I	363	‘ My period came last Sunday evening . ’
19463	19472	19473	19473	he	431	‘ Could you have parked any further away ? ’
19485	19489	19473	19473	he	431	‘ At least I ’m
19493	19517	19473	19473	he	431	’ I walk to the rack of trollies lined up at the shelter and slip a pound in the top to release one . ‘
19526	19554	19555	19555	Cathy	90	’ I ask as we make our way up the canopied walkway . Jesse and a supermarket is not something that fits together naturally . He shrugs . ‘
19566	19645	19559	19559	I	363	’ The mention of Jesse ’s super plush sex club has me bristling and losing all enthusiasm in trying to make conversation . I feel his eyes on me , but I ignore it and focus ahead of me . As we make our way around the supermarket , I load in the essentials and Jesse loads in a dozen jars of peanut butter , a few jars of chocolate spread and a several cans of squirty cream . ‘
19652	19672	19673	19673	Cathy	90	’ I ask , dumping milk in the trolley . He shrugs and takes control with his good hand . ‘
19678	19716	19673	19673	Cathy	90	’ I guide him around into the next aisle and instantly realise that I ’ve unwittingly led him into the alcohol section . I fly around in a panic and get the trolley rammed into my shin . ‘
19719	19726	19727	19727	Ava	0	’ I exclaim on a wince . ‘
19733	19743	19727	19727	Ava	0	’ I rub my shin . Damn that hurts . ‘
19751	19767	19768	19768	Ava	0	’ I blurt , frantically pushing the trolley back towards him . He walks backwards . ‘
19773	19774	19775	19775	I	363	’ ‘
19776	19787	19775	19775	I	363	’m sorry . I did n’t realise where we were . ’
19788	19797	19775	19775	I	363	‘ For God ’s sake , woman , I ’m
19817	19827	19828	19828	I	363	’ I frown and look down at my shin . ‘
19829	19832	19833	19833	I	363	’m fine , ’
19871	19921	19870	19870	I	363	’m stunned when I find Jesse on his knees in front of me . He rests his damaged hand around the back of my leg and lifts with his good hand to sit my foot on his knee before leaning down and planting a kiss on my shin . We ’re
19943	19946	19947	19947	he	467	‘ Better ? ’
19956	19958	19950	19950	he	467	‘ I ’m
19966	19997	19964	19964	Ava	0	’ I look down at his beautiful , stubbled face and I want to cry . I can see total sincerity in his eyes as he looks up at me . ‘
20000	20184	19964	19964	Ava	0	’ I reply quietly , not knowing what else to say . He nods and sighs , then leans up and plants a chaste kiss on my stomach before getting to his feet . He leads me away from the alcohol aisle and straight to the cosmetics section where he collects some shaving gel and blades . I look up at his overgrown stubble and wonder whether I want him to get rid of it . The more I look at it , the more I like it . By the time we get back to Lusso , it ’s six o’clock and we find the door has been repaired . Jesse goes to lie on the sofa , exhausted from a few hours out , and I stand in the kitchen after unpacking the shopping , wondering what to do . It ’s Saturday evening and usually at this time I would be cracking open a bottle of wine and settling down for the evening . There is no wine and I ca n’t settle , so instead , I ring Kate . ‘
20191	20211	20212	20212	We	469	’ I ask as I plant myself on a barstool with a coffee – not wine , but coffee . ‘
20213	20219	20220	20220	she	470	’re on our way out . ’
20224	20227	20220	20220	she	470	‘ We ? ’
20228	20247	20220	20220	she	470	‘ Yes , we . Do n’t ask me who we is , Ava . You already know . ’
20258	20276	20257	20257	I	363	’m not to make a big deal of it . I am , however , slightly envious . ‘
20282	20283	20284	20284	Sam	564	’ ‘
20292	20302	20284	20284	Sam	564	’ What ? Okay , the envy has disintegrated . ‘
20306	20317	20284	20284	Sam	564	’ I blurt incredulously . Is she winding me up ? ‘
20333	20336	20337	20339	Holy fucking shit	91	’m curious . ’
20402	20485	20399	20407	The man I ’m involved with owns the place	564	’m involved with owns the place , and I ’ve still not established all of the nitty gritty with regards to the business and/or recreational side of things . Well , I know it has been recreational , but to what level ? Judging by the evil looks I was subjected to by the female members on the few occasions I was there , my suspicions tell me there has been a lot of recreational . The thought depresses me , and I ’m
20494	20503	20399	20407	The man I ’m involved with owns the place	564	‘ And Sam ’s happy to take you ? ’
20523	20539	20540	20540	She	473	‘ Yeah , he ’s told me what goes down and I want to see . ’
20555	20582	20554	20554	I	363	’m in meltdown just thinking about the place . I hate her for being so open - minded . And what does go down , anyway ? ‘
20589	20609	20612	20612	Jesse	431	’ I shrug to myself , spinning my coffee mug on the counter . What else can I say ? ‘
20614	20690	20612	20612	Jesse	431	’ she asks . I detect the edginess of her tone . Does she still like him as much now ? It ’s clear the fact that he owns The Manor will not be an issue , but she was n’t best pleased when I eventually stopped crying for long enough to tell her about the drunken arsehole I encountered when I came back to make amends with him . He seems fine , but I ’m
20702	20722	20698	20698	I	363	‘ He ’s fine . His hand is just muscle damage and he insists he ’s not an alcoholic . ’
20723	20725	20738	20738	she	474	‘ I ’m
20728	20736	20738	20738	she	474	’ Her sincerity is sweet , and I ’m
20753	20776	20777	20777	She	474	‘ Well , he does n’t fall out of bed and wrap his lips around a bottle of vodka , does he ? ’
20780	20808	20777	20777	She	474	‘ No ! He just does n’t know when to stop when he does start , apparently . It ’s still a problem , though , Kate . ’
20809	20817	20818	20818	she	474	‘ You ’ll be fine , Ava . ’
20826	20917	20825	20825	I	363	’m not so sure . I thought being here with him would start to mend the mess , but it has n’t . I ’ve told him what I want , but he does n’t seem to be all that keen on giving it to me , attempting , instead , to distract me as he knows best . I decide to give him until the morning . If he has n’t talked to me by then , I ’ll leave . I ’ll cave into his touch soon if I ’m
20921	20926	20927	20927	I	363	‘ Yeah , listen , ’
20935	20945	20927	20927	I	363	‘ I would say have fun tonight , but I ’m
20956	20957	20958	20958	Ava	0	’ ‘
20980	20981	20970	20970	I	363	’ ‘
20984	21194	21195	21195	I	363	’ I hang up and run through my times at The Manor , when I thought it was an innocent hotel . I shake my head at myself . How could I have missed it all when everything seems so obvious now ? I should cut myself some slack because I was completely diverted by a tall , lean framed man with dirty blonde hair and hypnotising green eyes . He was perfect . He still is , if a few pounds lighter and a few issues heavier . I make my way upstairs to change out of my dress , throwing on a pair of cotton shorts and a vest before removing all of the grips from my hair . When I get downstairs , Jesse is still asleep on the sofa . I mess around with the T.V cabinet for a while , but I ca n’t get the damn thing to open and reveal a television , so I slump into the chair and watch Jesse sleeping , his mangled hand draped over his solid chest and rising and falling with his steady breaths . As my thoughts wander naturally to chocolate éclairs , calla lilies and Angels , I drift off to sleep . Chapter 5 ‘
21199	21254	21195	21195	I	363	’ I come awake in a daze of darkness and rub my eyes as I sit up in the chair . It takes me a few moments to figure out where I am , but when I begin to focus , I find a handsome , dark blonde man crouched in front of me . ‘
21257	21287	21195	21195	I	363	’ he says softly as he brushes my hair from my face . I gaze around the vast open space to try and grab a hold of my bearings . ‘
21293	21306	21195	21195	I	363	’ I ask sleepily . He leans in and kisses my forehead . ‘
21311	21315	21195	21195	I	363	’ Midnight ? I ’m
21331	21349	21330	21330	I	363	’m properly woken up when the shrill sound of a phone ringtone stabs at the silent air . ‘
21354	21383	21384	21384	John	564	’ Jesse complains . I watch as he yanks his phone from the coffee table and looks at the screen . Who would be ringing at this time ? ‘
21386	21394	21384	21384	John	564	’ he greets calmly down the phone , ‘
21397	21403	21384	21384	John	564	’ He glances at me . ‘
21417	21422	21384	21384	John	564	’ He hangs up . ‘
21428	21450	21384	21384	John	564	’ I ask , fully awake now . He shoves his Converse on and stalks for the door , clearly unhappy . ‘
21462	21475	21456	21456	I	363	’ And just like that , he ’s gone . So , I ’m
21674	21679	21650	21650	I	363	‘ I love you . ’
21693	21730	21692	21692	I	363	’m somewhere between sleep and consciousness and my mouth wo n’t work . What time is it and how long has he been gone ? I do n’t get a chance to ask , though . I ’m
21742	21747	21748	21748	he	431	‘ You sleep here . ’
21767	21810	21766	21766	I	363	’m tugged back against his chest . If I was n’t so contented , I would be asking questions , but I am , so I wo n’t . My head hits the pillow and with Jesse ’s warmness surrounding me , I ’m
21814	21817	21822	21822	I	363	‘ Morning , ’
21823	21873	21874	21874	I	363	’m pinned to the mattress under a heady scent of fresh water and mint . My morning brain is desperately trying to convince me to struggle free , but my body is blocking all of the sensible instructions trying to filter through . He sits back on his heels . ‘
21880	21937	21874	21874	I	363	’ he whispers , clasping my hand and pulling me into a sitting position . He takes the hem of my vest and slowly pulls it up over my head before leaning into me and kissing the middle of my chest , running his tongue in a light , flicking circle up to my throat . I ’m
21944	21947	21948	21948	he	363	‘ Lace , ’
21984	21999	22000	22000	Jesse	431	’m dragged back onto Central Jesse Cloud Nine where I lose all cognitive reasoning . ‘
22007	22039	22042	22042	you	363	’ I say quietly as he kisses my throat and works his way to my ear . Every nerve is buzzing , pleading with me to shut up and accept him . ‘
22044	22057	22058	22058	Jesse	431	’ he whispers , finding my mouth and plunging his tongue in . ‘
22062	22070	22071	22071	Baby	93	’ My voice is a breathy whisper . ‘
22080	22095	22071	22071	Baby	93	’ He grips the nape of my neck and pulls me further into him . ‘
22101	22172	22071	22071	Baby	93	’ My body wins . I blank out my screaming conscience and surrender to him like the slave that I am . He wraps his arm around my lower back and eases me back down to the bed , sealing our mouths on the way , my entire being jumping to life as his hot , wet tongue slips gently between my lips and glides slowly around my mouth . We ’re
22315	22357	22358	22358	You	488	’m lost in him again . I whimper as he pulls his lips away from mine and sits back on his heels before he uses his good hand to drag my shorts down my legs , taking my underwear with them . ‘
22362	22371	22314	22314	I	363	’ he says , looking down at me . ‘
22379	22380	22314	22314	I	363	’ ‘
22390	22409	22388	22388	Ava	0	’ He throws my shorts and knickers to the side and pulls me up , sealing our mouths . ‘
22416	22618	22410	22410	We	489	’ I ca n’t fight him anymore . I hook my fingers in the waistband of his boxers and press my lips further to his as I push them down his thighs . He lets out a long moan , easing me back down onto the bed , causing me to lose my grip of his shorts , so I place my foot into the band and extend my leg to take them the rest of the way . He ’s leaning half on me , half off , his hard , lean body spreading the length of me as he claims my mouth , pushing his body further into mine . Weaving my fingers through his hair , I relish the friction of his long stubble against my face . It ’s too long to be sharp or coarse , so it feels more like a soft brush is being glided across my face . He separates our mouths and buries his face in my hair as he cups me between my thighs and draws his palm up the centre of my body , slowly over my stomach and then gradually up between my breasts , finishing against my throat . ‘
22626	22633	22624	22624	baby	363	’ he murmurs against my neck . ‘
22641	22642	22643	22643	I	363	’ ‘
22650	22682	22643	22643	I	363	’ I hold his head to me . I feel completely cocooned in strength , but he ’s not strong at the moment . I feel protected and safe , but I ’m
22698	22765	22697	22697	I	363	’m feeling overwhelmed too – completely overwhelmed with intense feelings for this troubled man . He moves himself so he ’s cradled between my thighs , and I soon feel the wet , slippery head of his morning erection pushing against me . My mind is a jumble of mixed thoughts , but then he rests on his elbows and gazes down at me , like I ’m
22809	22818	22819	22819	he	492	‘ Thank you for coming back to me , ’
22970	22975	22976	22976	he	492	‘ Look at me , ’
22999	23004	23005	23005	he	492	‘ I love you . ’
23049	23055	23041	23041	he	492	‘ Do n’t , Jesse . ’
23069	23078	23079	23079	he	492	‘ Ava , look at me , now . ’
23097	23110	23083	23083	I	363	‘ I ’ve been telling you how I feel the whole time . ’
23111	23129	23130	23130	I	363	‘ No , you have n’t . You were hijacking my phone and trying to control me . ’
23149	23160	23161	23161	He	492	‘ Ava , I ’ve never felt like this before . ’
23183	23201	23202	23202	He	492	‘ I ’ve been surrounded by naked women with no respect for themselves all of my life . ’
23221	23224	23202	23202	He	492	‘ Jesse ! ’
23225	23227	23232	23232	Ava	0	‘ You ’re
23234	23237	23232	23232	Ava	0	’ Thrust . ‘
23241	23250	23251	23251	Jesus	155	’ He pulls back and rams back in . ‘
23253	23262	23263	23263	You	155	’ He stills on a few deep breaths . ‘
23264	23296	23297	23297	He	155	’re mine , and mine alone , baby . Just for my eyes , just for my touch and just for my pleasure . Just mine . Do you understand me ? ’
23305	23315	23297	23297	He	155	‘ What about you ? Are you just mine ? ’
23329	23341	23316	23316	I	363	‘ Just yours , Ava . Tell me you love me . ’
23342	23345	23346	23346	I	363	‘ What ? ’
23358	23363	23364	23364	he	155	‘ You heard me . ’
23368	23381	23382	23382	I	363	‘ Do n’t make me fuck it out of you , baby . ’
23383	23387	23382	23382	I	363	’m stunned . I ’m
23467	23473	23474	23474	He	155	‘ Ava , answer me . ’
23489	23497	23474	23474	He	155	‘ Do n’t hold out on me . ’
23593	23599	23600	23600	I	363	‘ How did you know ? ’
23615	23625	23626	23626	He	155	‘ Damn it , Ava , look at me . ’
23647	23652	23653	23653	he	155	‘ I love you . ’
23672	23678	23653	23653	he	155	‘ I love you too ! ’
23715	23731	23732	23732	His	155	‘ I love you so fucking much . I did n’t think it was possible . ’
23774	23781	23782	23782	he	155	‘ Now , we make love . ’
23920	24022	23919	23919	I	363	’m coming apart . The consistency of his controlled , deep thrusts has me shuddering and tensing around him as my core convulses and grips his shaft on each and every plunge . The sheen of sweat across his brow and his frown line deep with concentration tells me he ’s tipping the edge too . Tilting my hips up on a thrust , I moan as he fills me to my absolute limit , the feel of his rhythmic , meticulous tempo having me wanting to squeeze my eyes shut , but I ca n’t drag them away from his . ‘
24025	24037	23919	23919	I	363	’ he says , his hot breath spreading across my face . ‘
24040	24055	24058	24058	Ava	0	’ I gasp , feeling him expand and throb in preparation for his release . ‘
24060	24151	24058	24058	Ava	0	’ A rush of air escapes his lips and his body goes rigid , but he does n’t remove his eyes from mine . My back arches on reflex when the spiraling rush of pleasure reaches its climax and sends me tumbling into a hurricane of uncontrollable feelings . I cry out in complete despairing pleasure , my body trembling in his hold . I close my eyes to blink back the tears that have developed as my orgasm begins to recede slowly and lazily with his continued even strokes . ‘
24154	24286	24287	24287	I	363	’ he commands softy , and I obey , opening my eyes again . He moans deeply and I tighten all of my muscles at my core to grip him and extract his release from him . How is he keeping his head up and his eyes open ? I can see the battle he ’s having with his instincts to hammer into me and throw his head back , but he ’s keeping a rein on his control . And then , you can almost hear the snap of his release as his cheeks puff out and he pushes himself into me , long and hard , holding himself there , my muscles obliging his throbbing erection and continuing with their slow , easy constrictions as he pours into me . ‘
24291	24344	24345	24345	I	363	’ I say quietly as he looks down at me , his chest heaving . There . I ’ve put it out there . My cards are well and truly on the table , and he did n’t technically fuck that one out of me . He rests his lips on mine . ‘
24352	24353	24350	24350	baby	363	’ ‘
24359	24390	24391	24391	You	363	’ I ask . I know I ’ve never told him . I ’ve screamed it in my head a thousand times , but I have never actually voiced it . ‘
24399	24403	24391	24391	You	363	’ He smiles , ‘
24412	24482	24483	24483	I	363	’ I do a quick run through of the night when I got ridiculously drunk and relented to his persistent pursuing again . I remember admitting it to myself , but I certainly do n’t remember blurting it out to him . Mind you , I do n’t remember much after Jesse escorted me from the bar . I was in a state . That ’s his fault too . ‘
24488	24497	24483	24483	I	363	’ I admit . I feel bloody stupid . ‘
24504	24513	24483	24483	I	363	’ He grinds his hips . I sigh . ‘
24520	24560	24483	24483	I	363	’ It all comes flooding back . He really was trying to fuck a love confession out of me . He watches me as I figure it out , and his mouth forms an O on a small smile . ‘
24566	24637	24483	24483	I	363	’ I say quietly . Drunken confessions . I had beaten myself up about it for days and days , and he knew all along ? Why did n’t he say something ? Why did n’t he just talk to me instead of trying to fuck it out of me ? So much could have been so very different . His smile disappears and is replaced with a stoic expression . ‘
24669	24670	24672	24672	they	500	’ ‘
24674	24682	24672	24672	they	500	’ I blurt . He almost laughs . ‘
24688	24694	24695	24695	I	363	’ He drops his eyes , ‘

24727	24772	24695	24695	I	363	’ I inwardly laugh . Little meltdown ? Bloody hell , what would be a big meltdown ? Women tell him they love him ? What women and how many are there ? I screw my face up in my own private disgust . I ’m
24779	24813	24814	24814	I	363	’m feeling about any other woman having him or loving him . I need to put these thoughts right out of my mind and fast . No good could come of me knowing . ‘

24919	24960	24917	24917	Jesse	431	’ He pulls his face up and I can see the cogs of his mind start revolving . I know he ’s thinking whether or not he should just tell me his real age and stop with his silly diversion . ‘
24966	24994	24917	24917	Jesse	431	’ He frowns . Oh , I might be able to play this to my advantage . I think we may have got to thirty - ish . ‘

I jump up to go and find my phone , discovering it ’s nine o’clock and Dan has n’t called . That ’s a relief , but I do have twelve missed calls from Jesse . Huh ? I walk back into the bedroom and find him sat up against the headboard , brazenly naked and unashamed . I look down at myself . Oh , so am I. ‘
25763	25785	25652	25652	I	363	’ I say in confusion , holding my phone up to him . A disapproving look jumps up on his face . ‘

25999	26026	25998	25998	I	363	’m doubtful of his confidence . One drink and I could be faced with the menacing brute , who I really do n’t like very much . ‘

I can feel myself falling into the needing realms again , after just one love making session , and I really did n’t want to go there . He inches closer to me so our noses are nearly touching and his hot , minty breath is spreading all over my face . ‘

28655	28658	28650	28650	He	363	‘ No , ’

He is obviously older than me , he might be stinking rich , but that wo n’t cut any cloth with Mum and Dad , and the fact that he likes a trample every now and again will not help matters . It ’s near on impossible to hide my frustration when he ’s being challenging . Mind you , his quick acceptance of my reluctance to go with him this morning might be the breakthrough I ’ve been waiting for . We order coffee , water and pastries and chat about Dan ’s job , Australia and his future prospects . He ’s doing well . His friend is expanding the surf school business and wants Dan to partner him . I ’m

29565	29569	29553	29553	I	363	’ he shouts . ‘
29577	29588	29573	29573	you	155	’ Why ? Because I knew he would trample it ! ‘
29603	29663	29666	29666	you	155	’ I spit . It goes quiet down the phone , but I can still hear his laboured breathing . I can imagine he ’s been running around his penthouse in a frenzy searching every room . Oh hell , this is going to be hard work . That corner I thought we had turned has just been trampled . ‘
29668	29686	29687	29687	I	363	’ His voice has softened slightly , but he ’s clearly still unhappy about my undisclosed outing . ‘
29688	29693	29687	29687	I	363	’m at a café . ’
29694	29697	29687	29687	I	363	‘ Where ? ’
29706	29738	29705	29705	I	363	’m telling him that . He ’ll turn up , I know it , and then I will be left explaining to Dan who he is and where he came from . ‘
29753	29754	29745	29745	I	363	’ ‘
29762	29774	29775	29775	I	363	’ It ’s definitely a demand . I drop my shoulders . ‘
29778	29786	29775	29775	I	363	’ A silence spreads between us and I ’m
29808	29811	29802	29802	I	363	‘ Ava ? ’

29823	29860	29866	29866	Jesse	431	’ he says softly , but it ’s strained . I know he wants to rant and probably haul me back to Lusso , but he ca n’t do that if he ca n’t locate me . ‘
29868	29879	29866	29866	Jesse	431	’ I hang up and exhale an exhausted breath . I ’m
29948	29988	29947	29947	I	363	’m favouring ignorance is bliss . Then , I could just hang up and think he ’s an unreasonable control freak and be content to let him stew . But now I know , I ’ve hung up and I ’m
30004	30009	30010	30010	I	363	‘ Is everything okay ? ’
30029	30032	30023	30023	I	363	‘ Fine . ’
30033	30041	30042	30042	He	62	‘ I settled the bill . Here . ’
30048	30051	30042	30042	He	62	‘ Thanks . ’
30052	30058	30059	30059	He	62	‘ Are you all right ? ’
30076	30081	30082	30082	I	363	‘ Yeah , fine . ’
30089	30099	30082	30082	I	363	‘ So , what do you want to do ? ’
30100	30103	30104	30104	he	62	‘ Tussauds ? ’
30116	30123	30124	30124	He	62	‘ Absolutely , let ’s go . ’
30238	30336	30354	30354	I	363	’ in Tussaud ’s are royalty . I had a photo with William and Kate , and Dan was captured squeezing The Queen ’s boobs . We had dinner at our favourite Chinese in China Town and a few cheeky wines in a bar . I felt slightly guilty when I took my first sip , but I could hardly ask for water – Dan would have asked why . Besides , once I got the first glass down , the second was easier . I hug Dan tight as we say our goodbyes at the tube . ‘
30343	30347	30354	30354	I	363	’ I ask . ‘
30355	30371	30354	30354	I	363	’m going up to Manchester tomorrow to catch up with some university friends , but I ’m

30444	30507	30422	30422	He	363	’ I smile . He ’s worried . He strides off and leaves me wishing he could stay forever . I ’ve never needed him so much . As I enter the foyer of Lusso , Clive is on the telephone . I walk straight past his desk on my way to the lift . I really do n’t feel like chatting . ‘
30515	30534	30513	30513	Ava	0	’ he shouts after me , and I stop and roll my eyes before turning to face him . ‘
30537	30550	30551	30552	A lady	552	’ He shoves the phone into its cradle and hurries towards me . ‘
30571	30583	30570	30570	I	363	’m afraid I could n’t let her up . Mature woman . ’
30584	30588	30589	30589	I	363	‘ A lady ? ’
30599	30624	30625	30625	He	340	‘ Yes , nice woman with blonde wavy hair . She said it was urgent , but of course , you know the rules . ’
30641	30660	30640	30640	I	363	’m relieved he has stuck to the rules . Blonde , wavy hair ? Not Sarah , surely . ‘
30664	30668	30719	30719	she	554	’ He shrugs . ‘
30673	30694	30700	30700	Clive	76	’ Okay . I do n’t like Sarah but she definitely does n’t look like she ’s in her forties . ‘
30702	30709	30700	30700	Clive	76	’ He looks at his watch . ‘
30716	30717	30700	30700	Clive	76	’ ‘
30724	30728	30731	30731	she	554	’ He frowns . ‘

30789	31109	31112	31112	he	556	’ I pivot and carry on towards the elevators . I board the lift and punch in the code . A lady ? And a vague lady who thought she could march up to the penthouse unannounced ? The elevators doors open and I step out to find Jesse ’s front door open . Does this man have no regard for home security ? Granted , he has a twenty four hour concierge downstairs to monitor the comings and goings , and a team of security , but a bit of common sense would n’t go a miss . I shut the door behind me and instantly feel on my guard . The sound system is playing . It ’s not as ear piercing as last time , but it ’s the track playing that has me on edge . It ’s the same one I walked in to last Sunday when I found Jesse drunk . Angel . I run through the penthouse , leaving the music on . Finding Jesse is more important than turning off the tormenting song which reminds me of that awful day . I head straight for the terrace , but he ’s not there . I dump my bag and take the stairs two at a time and bolt into the bedroom . Nothing . Where is he ? Panic starts to flood me , but then I hear the shower running . I fly into the bathroom and come to an abrupt stop when I see Jesse sat on the floor of the shower , naked except for a pair of running shorts that are soaking wet and clinging to his thighs . His back is against the cold tiled wall , his knees pulled up and his arms resting on top of them . His head in slumped as the water crashes down around him . As if he senses I ’m
31191	31196	31183	31183	He	556	‘ I love you . ’
31197	31210	31211	31211	He	556	‘ I know you do . How many laps did you do ? ’
31231	31234	31217	31217	He	556	‘ Three . ’
31235	31241	31242	31242	I	363	‘ That ’s too much . ’
31247	31279	31280	31280	I	363	’re talking twenty miles here . It ’s not a quick jog around the park to alleviate some stress . His body is not strong enough for this at the moment . ‘
31289	31290	31280	31280	I	363	’ ‘
31297	31323	31291	31291	I	363	’ I say with only a light dash of sarcasm . He shifts his hands to my hips and tweaks my hipbone . I jerk . ‘
31330	31359	31324	31324	You	559	’ he says sternly . Perhaps I should have , but he probably would ’ve trampled it , and he ca n’t be running a marathon every time we ’re
31362	31369	31370	31370	I	363	‘ I was always coming back , ’
31374	31384	31385	31385	He	559	‘ I ca n’t be joined at your hip . ’
31401	31409	31410	31410	he	559	‘ I wish you bloody could be . ’
31413	31420	31410	31410	he	559	‘ You ’ve had a drink . ’
31428	31433	31434	31434	I	363	‘ Have you eaten ? ’

31483	31491	31477	31477	I	363	’ He tightens his grip on me . ‘
31495	31498	31494	31494	I	363	’m comfy . ’
31544	31563	31543	31543	we	562	’re apart , I ’ll never settle . We most certainly have n’t turned a corner , and I ’m

31670	31673	31674	31674	I	363	’m comfy . ’
31693	31696	31697	31697	I	363	‘ Stop ! ’
31700	31707	31697	31697	I	363	‘ I need to feed you ! ’
31708	31734	31735	31735	He	363	‘ Yes , you do . And I want my Ava , stripped naked and laying on our bed so I can binge on her . ’

31835	31842	31843	31843	he	564	‘ Loving now , food later . ’

31896	31931	31769	31769	I	363	’ He picks a bath sheet up from the pile on the shelf and starts rubbing the wetness from my hair with his good hand . It could do with a shampoo and condition . ‘
31939	31993	31769	31769	I	363	’ He brushes off my worry . I start to shiver , my clinging dress rubbing on the goose bumps that are engulfing me . Jesse drapes the towel around my back and uses the corners to pull me into him , kissing me hard on the lips . I catch him wince . ‘
32007	32008	31999	32000	My man	564	’ ‘
32017	32033	31999	32000	My man	564	’ he whispers , pushing his groin into my thigh and taking my mouth gently . ‘
32041	32050	31999	32000	My man	564	’ He pulls back on a little pout . ‘
32059	32084	31999	32000	My man	564	’ Another submission ? This certainly is progress . Nothing usually gets in the way of him taking me wherever and however he pleases . ‘
32090	32110	31999	32000	My man	564	’ I ask . He flicks his eyes to his fist that ’s clenching the corner of the towel . ‘
32126	32127	32128	32128	You	363	’ ‘
32132	32145	32128	32130	You brave boy	567	’ He smirks and nuzzles our noses , then kisses my forehead . ‘
32155	32171	32128	32130	You brave boy	567	’ He goes to lift me off the unit , but I brush him away . ‘
32174	32180	32181	32181	Your	567	’ He scowls at me . ‘
32192	32200	32201	32201	I	363	’re hoofing me all over the place . ’
32227	32241	32242	32242	I	363	’m then thrown up over his shoulder and carried out of the bathroom . ‘
32248	32261	32242	32242	I	363	’ he declares , chucking me onto the middle of the bed . ‘
32267	32268	32264	32264	your	363	’ ‘
32274	32333	32264	32264	your	363	’ I say , recovering from my flight . He makes a point of demonstrating his disgust with an audible grumble before he stalks out of the room and returns moments later with all of my stuff spread between his good hand , under his arms and in his mouth . He dumps it all on the bed . ‘
32336	32392	32264	32264	your	363	’ I reach into my bag and retrieve some clean knickers and my oversized , black sweatshirt , but my comfortable cotton knickers are soon snatched out of my hand . I frown as I watch him riffle through my bag and pull out a pair of lace replacements . He hands them to me . ‘
32397	32514	32264	32264	your	363	’ He nods in approval to his own demand , and I comply without hesitation or complaint , putting the lace knickers on , and then my oversized jumper . I watch as Jesse ditches the wet shorts and swaps them for a blue jersey pair . I can see new definition in his back and arms as his muscles roll and flex when he pulls them up . I sit and admire from my position on the bed before he picks me up again and carries me down to the kitchen . First , I turn the music off on a little shudder , then I stand in front of the fridge scanning the shelves . ‘
32520	32532	32533	32533	I	363	’ Maybe some eggs , he could probably use the protein . ‘
32543	32546	32547	32547	He	363	’re having . ’
32571	32576	32577	32577	I	363	‘ Put that back ! ’

32650	32670	32647	32648	a child	446	’ I settle on chicken fillets , grabbing them from the fridge . I ’ve already eaten , but I ’m

32699	32706	32691	32692	a child	446	’ he asks over his finger . ‘
32710	32736	32709	32709	you	446	’re a child because of the way you eat peanut butter . No one over the age of ten should finger dip jars and as I ’m
32754	32785	32746	32746	I	363	’ I fire a disgusted look at him as I find the tinfoil and wrap the chicken up with some Parma ham , then put them in an oven dish . ‘
32798	32827	32709	32709	you	446	’ He thrusts his peanut butter covered finger over the island and into my line of vision . I screw my face up . I detest peanut butter . ‘
32830	32899	32709	32709	you	446	’ I say , putting the chicken in the oven . He shrugs and then licks it off himself . I get some sugar snap peas and new potatoes from the fridge and load them into the built in steamer , then fiddle with a few knobs before it kicks into action . Lifting myself up on to the worktop , I watch him on a small smile . ‘
32903	32915	32916	32916	I	363	’ He pauses mid - scoop and looks up at me . ‘
32926	32932	32916	32916	I	363	’ Another finger goes in . ‘
32938	32939	32934	32934	you	446	’ ‘

33014	33056	33057	33057	I	363	’ I correct him . I do n’t ever want to be a nag . He starts chewing his bottom lip , watching me carefully , his eyes dancing . I shiver from top to toe . I know that look . ‘
33062	33092	33093	33093	I	363	’ he says quietly , running his eyes down my front to my bare legs . It ’s oversized and it covers my bum . It ’s hardly sexy . ‘

33112	33148	33109	33109	I	363	’ he asserts quietly . He ’s going to distract me again . I need to get some proper food in him and we need to discuss the fact that it is Monday tomorrow and I ’m
33182	33203	33181	33181	I	363	’m concerned that he ’ll maintain his previous unreasonable request to have me working at The Manor all day everyday . ‘
33209	33230	33181	33181	I	363	’ I say positively . I do n’t know why I choose that tone . Positive as opposed to what ? ‘
33233	33293	33181	33181	I	363	’ He folds his arms over his chest . What do I say ? Would it be too much to ask him to be reasonable about my requirement to tend to other clients ? He has openly admitted he does n’t like sharing me , socially or professionally . I drum my fingers on the worktop next to me . ‘
33307	33323	33297	33297	I	363	’ I see a fleeting look of panic sweeps over his stubbled face , and I ’m
33335	33342	33343	33343	he	575	‘ What have you got planned ? ’
33357	33360	33346	33346	I	363	‘ Work . ’
33394	33409	33410	33410	I	363	‘ Do n’t even think about it . I ’ve important meetings to keep . ’

33449	33460	33448	33448	I	363	’m bracing myself for a countdown or a sense fuck . ‘
33475	33508	33509	33509	I	363	’ I affirm assertively . He does have a business to run and he ’s been unconscious for a whole working week . John ca n’t be expected to run things forever . ‘
33513	33534	33509	33509	I	363	’ he grumbles . I mentally cheer . No countdown ? No sense fuck ? We really are moving forward . ‘
33546	33553	33554	33554	He	575	’ I completely forgot about that . ‘
33557	33562	33563	33563	He	575	’ He looks surprised . ‘
33604	33616	33617	33617	I	363	’ I watch for his reaction , but he just frowns . ‘
33634	33655	33626	33626	my	363	’ That ’s it ? He ’ll have a word with Clive ? I want to know who she is . ‘
33660	33677	33626	33626	my	363	’ I ask casually , as I get down from the worktop to check the steamer . ‘
33681	33699	33626	33626	my	363	’ He jumps up himself and gets some cutlery from the drawer . Is he avoiding this ? ‘
33708	33731	33732	33732	Ava	0	’ I ask doubtfully , while removing the chicken from the oven and putting it in the pan to finish it off . ‘

I go about serving up and present him with the first meal I have ever made him . I hate cooking . He tucks straight in . ‘
33832	33841	33830	33830	Yum	103	’ he mumbles around a mouthful of chicken . ‘
33850	33863	33830	33830	Yum	103	’ Better if he had n’t of interrupted me with a meltdown . ‘
33866	33875	33830	33830	Yum	103	’ I answer , sitting next to him . ‘
33884	33936	33937	33937	We	584	’ It ’s good to see him eat something other than peanut butter . He ’s like a different man again – so confident and self - assured , but in the next breath he ’s falling to pieces . Do I really have that much of an impact on him ? ‘
33957	33969	33945	33946	Madame Tussaud	104	’ This chicken really is good . I ca n’t believe I ’m

34069	34073	34064	34064	he	431	‘ Stop worrying . ’
34119	34169	34118	34118	we	585	’re done , I load the dishwasher and my thoughts start drifting . Him brushing off the mystery visitor is eating away at me . He ’s being vague and it ’s bothering me . I turn to challenge him and crash straight into his hard , naked chest . ‘
34172	34197	34118	34118	we	585	’ He towers over me , breathing hard , and my eyes weld to his huge erection tenting the front of his jersey shorts . ‘
34202	34241	34118	34118	we	585	’ he demands , his voice low and husky . I look up into his green eyes and wisely note that he ’s not in a fucking about mood . I want to bring to his attention that I ’m
34266	34329	34330	34330	You	587	’m absolutely delighted to see my domineering man back . It ’s been too long . I grasp the hem of my sweatshirt and slowly draw it up over my head and then drop it to the ground . He runs his eyes appreciatively down my body , over my exposed breasts and settles his gaze on the juncture of my thighs . ‘
34331	34338	34339	34339	He	586	’re impossibly beautiful and all mine . ’
34449	34459	34448	34448	I	363	’m defenseless to him . It ’s hopeless . I ’m
34467	34477	34478	34478	His	586	‘ I think I ’ll let you come first . ’
34483	34486	34478	34478	His	586	‘ Then I ’m
34495	34586	34478	34478	His	586	’ I gasp at his fierce promise as he runs his palms the full length of my legs , from my ankles to the back of my thighs , and then yanks me onto his waiting mouth . His invasion of me reduces me to a moaning mess in his grasp as he works his tongue over every part of me – expertly , meaningfully . My hands find his hair and my hips roll onto his mouth , with no encouragement from my brain . My head falls back . ‘
34590	34605	34478	34478	His	586	’ I groan , the thrum at my sex accelerating into a constant vibration . ‘
34608	34690	34478	34478	His	586	’ he mumbles against my flesh , which only serves to propel me that little bit closer to utter ecstasy . I feel one of his hands move from the back of my leg and slide up the inside of my thigh . His finger slips inside me . On a desperate cry , I release his head to lean back on the worktop for support , his circling finger stretching me and brushing my front wall on each rotation . I ’m
34701	34708	34709	34709	He	363	‘ Tell me when , Ava . ’
34737	34742	34743	34743	I	363	‘ That ’s it . ’
34765	34815	34816	34816	You	589	’m wiped out from the onslaught of his mouth , and I sag against the worktop on a violent round of shakes , my heart clattering in my chest . He reins in his rhythm and laps gently , letting me drift down on a long , satisfied sigh . ‘
34817	34821	34822	34822	I	363	’re too good . ’
34854	34858	34859	34859	he	363	‘ I know , ’
34862	34868	34859	34859	he	363	‘ Are n’t you lucky ? ’
34958	34964	34936	34936	He	363	’m eye level with him . ‘
34977	34978	34936	34936	He	363	’ ‘
34983	35023	35025	35025	him	363	’ I challenge , draping my arms over his shoulders . He smashes his lips against mine possessively and attacks my mouth . When he ’s like this , I forget about his weak moments – the moments when I ’m
35155	35161	35154	35154	I	363	’m mentally begging for him . ‘
35167	35171	35154	35154	I	363	’ he whispers . ‘
35179	35440	35174	35174	you	595	’ I nuzzle my cheek into him as he laps at my ear , causing the heartbeat at my core to kick in again , subtle and slow . He steps back from me and the absence of his warm body in front of mine leaves me chilly , wanting to pull him back to me . Casting my eyes around the gym , I wonder what he ’s got planned . My stare falls back to Jesse . He ’s watching me with promising , lust filled eyes , as he reaches for his shorts and pushes them down his legs , his arousal springing free . I gasp . I do n’t know why , I ’ve seen it enough times , but it still makes my breath hitch . I glide my eyes up , past his scar and to his perfect pecs . I will never tire of staring at the fine physique of the man who is stood in front of me – not ever . He ’s a work of art , carefully sculptured and polished to complete perfection . He nods behind me and I slowly pivot , but all I see is the rowing machine and his punch bag . I turn back and face him . His face is completely impassive , and he slowly nods again , indicating that what he has in mind is , indeed , behind me . It dawns on me . He said he was going to rip me in half . Oh good Lord ! ‘
35443	35515	35526	35526	he	596	’ I whisper . He starts walking slowly towards me and the potential of his intention has me fidgeting on the spot . Taking my hand , he leads me to the rowing machine and then lowers his big , naked body so he is sitting on the seat . His erection stands up vertical from his body and the prospect of this scenario suddenly has me panting with anticipation . I ’m
35542	35611	35541	35541	I	363	’m straddling his legs . I look down at him , my heart kicking into its maximum speed limit as I wait for his next instruction . He reaches up and cups my breasts with his big palms and softly , slowly massages them until they ache with heaviness . I do n’t miss the small wince on his face , but he does n’t stop , and I ’m
35621	35624	35625	35625	My	363	‘ Hmmm . ’
35643	35651	35652	35652	he	596	‘ Ava , you fucking kill me . ’
35666	35671	35672	35672	he	596	‘ I love you . ’
35695	35707	35685	35685	I	363	‘ I love how you flinch when I touch you here . ’
35726	35737	35738	35738	He	596	‘ I love how wet you are for me here . ’
35757	35764	35754	35754	I	363	‘ I love how you taste . ’
35826	35837	35819	35819	He	596	‘ I love how it feels to be inside you . ’
35847	35854	35855	35855	he	596	‘ Wrap your legs around me . ’
35895	35898	35899	35899	he	596	‘ I.love.you . ’
36041	36046	36047	36047	I	363	‘ I love you . ’
36063	36075	36053	36053	He	596	‘ I ca n’t tell you how happy that makes me . ’
36085	36091	36076	36076	He	596	‘ Do you need me ? ’
36113	36118	36108	36108	we	599	‘ I need you . ’
36119	36128	36129	36129	he	596	‘ That makes me happy too . Again ? ’
36144	36147	36133	36133	he	596	‘ Please . ’
36158	36161	36148	36148	We	599	‘ Wow ! ’
36179	36194	36178	36178	We	599	’re travelling back up the runner , a bit faster this time . Jolt ! ‘
36197	36198	36199	36199	I	363	’ ‘
36202	36206	36199	36199	I	363	’ he whispers . ‘

36213	36287	36199	36199	I	363	’ I plunge my tongue into his mouth desperately . He slides us down slowly , but does n’t let it hit the end this time . Instead , he pushes off with his feet and sends us gliding up the runner . We hit the end with such force , our bodies collide hard and I have to release his lips and bury my face in his shoulder on a choked scream . ‘
36291	36412	36415	36415	Ava	0	’ he strains and repeats the same delicious move . Slide and hit ! This is intense . I ’ve never felt him so deep . I rest my mouth on his shoulder , resisting the urge to clamp onto him with my teeth , my hands moving onto the back of his head to hold me steady as he slides us back down the runner , ready for another crash to the top . My insides are furling , and I can feel him twitching and kicking inside me . He catapults us back up the runner and when we hit the top , my teeth sink into his shoulder and I cry out in pure , exquisite pleasure . ‘
36417	36432	36415	36415	Ava	0	’ I release my teeth and kiss my bite mark as we descend again . ‘
36441	36471	36415	36415	Ava	0	’ he pants . Oh , he likes it . I recall many times when I have bit him and stabbed him with my nails . I do as I ’m
36486	36490	36478	36478	I	363	‘ Shit , I ’m
36495	36507	36508	36508	You	0	’ he yells , letting us roll back down the runner . ‘
36511	36512	36508	36508	You	0	’ ‘
36515	36620	36508	36508	You	0	’ I wrap my mouth around his shoulder and clamp my teeth lightly , ready for his assault . He lets loose . There are no more controlled movements . He slides and crashes us relentlessly as I clamp onto him with my teeth and fingernails . The intensity of his muscled length pounding me deeply has me screaming his name against his shoulder . I start to feel fireworks fizzing as he continues with the slides and hits , pushing me towards ultimate detonation . The relentless throbbing and beating of his erection deep inside me has me sprinting to the finish and I ’m
36667	36677	36666	36666	I	363	’m still pulsing and riding out my orgasm when I ’m
36716	36718	36722	36722	lady	59	‘ You ’re
36724	36781	36782	36782	I	363	’ He twists his head to take a look at himself , and then his eyes flick to mine . Taking possession of my mouth , he kisses me deeply and I squeeze him in my arms , joining him in his blissful oblivion . I could stay like this forever , completely encased in Jesse . ‘
36783	36799	36800	36800	He	363	’m going to take you to bed and sleep all night buried deep inside you . ’
36810	36816	36817	36817	he	363	‘ Kiss me , now . ’
36853	36856	36857	36857	he	363	‘ Savage . ’
36956	36961	36962	36962	he	363	‘ Stay with me . ’

37005	37060	36976	36976	He	363	’ He drops his face and circles my nose with his . Oh ? Does this man know the meaning of the word gradual ? He ’s being a bit hasty , and we still have n’t discussed any of the more important stuff – like The Manor and work and his challenging ways . ‘
37071	37078	36976	36976	He	363	’ He licks my bottom lip . ‘
37101	37105	37110	37110	I	363	’ Now , I ’m
37120	37147	37119	37119	I	363	’m facing an attack of the sulks or a sense fuck , and I do n’t want to spoil this moment . I need this moment . ‘
37159	37181	37182	37182	You	608	’ I ask . He pulls his face up , his expression not quite sulky , but well on its way . ‘
37186	37187	37182	37182	You	608	’ ‘
37194	37205	37182	37182	You	608	’ I try to reason with him . He frowns . ‘
37211	37249	37250	37250	I	363	’ He lifts his torso up and slips out from me a little , planting his forearms into the mattress on either side of my head . He plunges forward and my breath catches in my throat . ‘
37259	37284	37250	37250	I	363	’ He smirks , knowing damn well what he ’s doing to me . He ’s going to hit me with a sense fuck . ‘
37292	37310	37314	37314	he	610	’ He lazily pulls back and slowly pushes forward again . I clench my eyes closed . I ’m
37337	37346	37336	37336	I	363	’m really not sure about living with him . ‘
37355	37374	37336	37336	I	363	’ I feign shock on a rushed breath . He gasps and drives long and controlled into me . ‘
37381	37390	37336	37336	I	363	’ I throw my head back and moan . ‘
37400	37405	37397	37398	Mr Ward	340	’ He withdraws slowly . ‘
37409	37438	37397	37398	Mr Ward	340	’ he shouts as he pounds forward , knocking the wind right out of me , forcing my arms to fly back to brace myself on the headboard . ‘
37451	37519	37449	37449	Ava	0	’ Oh , here it comes . He ’s going to fuck some sense into me that makes no sense at all . Moving in with him ? It ’s way too soon . My muscles tighten and my blood heats , sailing through my veins at a ridiculous speed . I hate that he does this to me . All sensibility is well and truly derailed . ‘
37522	37564	37449	37449	Ava	0	’ I snap , and he thunders into me again , grunting as he does . He reaches forward with his bad hand and slides his palm under the back of my head , pulling me up to face him . I ’m
37585	37589	37590	37590	he	611	‘ Say it . ’
37599	37627	37598	37598	I	363	’m not going to give in on this . It really is too soon . He wo n’t stop this ; he ’s too far gone himself . ‘
37630	37670	37598	37598	I	363	’ I state firmly and precisely on a pant . He growls and hammers forward , pounding mercifully into me . I grip onto him with the muscles of my womb as he forces me further up the bed . ‘
37679	37699	37677	37677	Ava	0	’ he roars . A bead of sweat trails down his temple and his frown line jumps into position . ‘

37706	37745	37746	37746	You	0	’ he shouts , and it echoes around the bedroom before he smashes our mouths together viciously . I buck and writher under his forceful body and greedy mouth as my pending release simmers low in my groin . ‘
37750	37764	37746	37746	You	0	’ he gasps against my mouth as he persists with his relentless pounds . ‘

37803	37845	37746	37746	You	0	’ he growls . I feel the wound up coils snapping inside me as I fly into a bottom pit of pure pleasure beneath him . All reason is lost as he takes ownership of my body , soul and mind . ‘
37857	37861	37863	37863	your	0	’ I scream . ‘
37867	37967	37863	37863	your	0	’ His booming voice is piercing as he joins me in my pleasure and releases my hair before punching his fist into the mattress . That had to hurt ! He pushes himself into me as deep as he can and holds himself there , his head rolling back . He groans . I feel his hot release pumping deep into me , and I bring my hands down from the headboard to rest on his chest . His head drops , his eyes find mine and he slowly circles his hips against me , easing us both down . ‘
37977	37994	37995	37995	I	363	’ His voice is hoarse and dry . I smooth his solid chest under my palms . ‘
38001	38066	37995	37995	I	363	’ I say , and then mentally slap myself for my poor choice of words . He ca n’t hold me to this , surely . But then I realise … this is Jesse , my unreasonable control freak . He can , and he will . He smiles a glorious , full smile and kisses me tenderly , then rolls us over so I ’m
38095	38108	38109	38109	I	363	‘ I ca n’t be with you every second of the day . ’

38206	38242	38205	38205	I	363	’m the answer to that . It is miles away from the domineering brute who just fucked some sense into me . Is it sense , though , or just pure craziness ? Chapter 7 I ’m
38316	38319	38320	38320	He	363	‘ Morning . ’
38341	38404	38340	38340	I	363	’m looking at a different man . Have I dreamt the last couple of days ? He is fully clad in a charcoal grey suit , crisp white shirt and a soft pink tie . He ’s clean shaven , his messy blonde hair has been manipulated to the side and his green eyes are twinkling in delight . He looks stunning . ‘
38409	38414	38340	38340	I	363	’ I stutter . I ’m

38463	38482	38483	38483	You	616	’m staggered . I was sure that I would be set for battle this morning with Mr Challenging . ‘

38507	38579	38462	38462	I	363	’ I ask on a frown . So he can do this every morning ? Maybe moving in with him would n’t be such a bad idea after all . He lets me slide down his front , then stands back to look me up and down . He clasps his newly shaved chin with his bad hand and arches a brow on a mild grin . Oh fucking hell ! I ’m
38582	38585	38586	38586	I	363	‘ Shit ! ’
38623	38628	38629	38629	He	363	‘ Watch your mouth ! ’

38882	38891	38878	38878	I	363	‘ I was caught at a weak moment . ’
38934	38939	38933	38933	I	363	’m so bloody easy . ‘

It ’s nonsensical , but I ’ll take the reminder . I grab his suit jacket , clench my fists and moan into his mouth . I feel him grin against my lips before he releases them and pushes me down on the worktop . The coldness of the marble radiates through me , but I ’m

39284	39329	39334	39334	Ava	0	’ he barks , but I ca n’t answer . Speech has totally evaded me . With each powerful drive , he is edging me closer and closer . I inhale and hold my breath as I reach the summit of my build up . ‘

39874	39880	39881	39881	he	431	‘ Fuck off , Ava . ’
39906	39948	39905	39905	I	363	’m pleasantly surprised by his happy persona this morning . I had been bracing myself for a challenge , trying to get myself out of the penthouse Jesse - free and on with my working day . This is progress . I ’m
40089	40097	40075	40075	I	363	‘ Clive , I need a cab ! ’
40098	40107	40108	40108	He	76	‘ Ava , how are you this morning ? ’
40113	40119	40108	40108	He	76	‘ Your transport is here . ’
40120	40124	40125	40125	He	76	‘ My transport ? ’
40184	40197	40177	40177	I	363	‘ Did Jesse speak to you about the visitor he had yesterday ? ’
40198	40203	40204	40204	Clive	76	‘ No , Ava . ’
40239	40252	40253	40253	His	564	‘ She ’s here , Jesse , I ’ll be there soon . ’
40311	40317	40306	40306	I	363	‘ Why are you here ? ’
40328	40338	40339	40339	He	564	‘ Jesse asked me to take you to work . ’
40400	40424	40391	40391	he	564	‘ I need to get my car . Do you mind ? It ’s at Kate ’s , she lives in Notting Hill . ’
40533	40541	40542	40542	His	564	‘ Did you get the gates sorted ? ’
40575	40582	40583	40583	I	363	‘ The gates of The Manor . ’
40586	40592	40593	40593	He	564	‘ They malfunctioned last Sunday . ’
40605	40611	40593	40593	He	564	‘ All sorted , girl . ’
40622	40644	40621	40621	I	363	’m thinking ? We travel in silence , except for John ’s humming , and he drops me at Kate ’s . ‘
40649	40659	40647	40647	John	564	’ I call , jumping out of his car . ‘
40663	40707	40647	40647	John	564	’ he rumbles , and he ’s gone . It ’s eight . I have time , so I run up the path to Kate ’s house . I head straight through to find her whisking a gigantic bowl of sugar and butter . ‘
40710	40726	40647	40647	John	564	’ I dunk my finger in her bowl . She swats it with her spoon . ‘
40744	40771	40737	40737	I	363	’ She ’s really flustered which is a million miles away from her usual calm and collective façade . What ’s got her in this state ? ‘
40775	40779	40737	40737	I	363	’ I smirk . ‘
40782	40804	40737	40737	I	363	’ she snaps , tipping flour onto the measuring scales . I take the sensible decision to leave it right there . ‘
40810	40824	40825	40825	He	431	’ she asks . Oh , we ’ve gone from Dan to brother ? ‘
40829	40839	40840	40840	Jesse	431	’ I wo n’t go into too many details . ‘
40842	40859	40840	40840	Jesse	431	’ she asks , her tongue hanging out as she bends down to gage the scales . ‘
40862	40908	40909	40909	Ava	0	’ I flop down into one of the tub chairs . She straightens up and looks at me questioningly . I have n’t got time at the moment to go into too many details , there is far too much to get her opinion on . ‘
40911	40915	40916	40916	He	431	’ I sigh . ‘
40956	40965	40945	40945	He	431	’ I shrug . Kate gapes at me . ‘
40968	40972	40945	40945	He	431	’ I laugh , ‘
40975	40976	40945	40945	He	431	’ ‘
40984	40995	40997	40997	she	0	’ she asks . The question shocks me , but I ’m
41006	41045	40997	40997	she	0	‘ I think so . He wants me day and night and a little bit in between . He ’s bad enough already , with his demands , control and worrying . I ca n’t lose my identity . ’
41046	41056	41057	41057	She	0	‘ Well said . Have you told him this ? ’
41069	41093	41057	41057	She	0	‘ No . Hey what went down at The Manor on Saturday night and why did n’t you answer any of my calls ? ’
41108	41111	41112	41112	she	0	‘ Nothing ! ’
41116	41124	41125	41125	I	363	‘ I forgot to call you back . ’
41126	41130	41131	41131	I	363	’m immediately suspicious . ‘
41140	41167	41131	41131	I	363	’ I say with a raised brow . She was a bit quick to shoot that answer at me . What has she been up to ? ‘
41170	41190	41191	41191	I	363	’ She gets all flustered and flappy as she returns to mixing her cake mixture a little too frantically . ‘
41206	41207	41210	41210	chick	641	’ ‘
41212	41241	41210	41210	chick	641	’ Sam ’s cheerful voice comes from the doorway and we both look up in unison . I cough , looking anywhere and everywhere , except at Sam . ‘
41244	41284	41285	41285	Samuel	564	’ I wave a flappy hand in his direction . He ’s a nightmare . I feel my face burning up as I glance at Kate in desperation , silently begging her to do something about the cheeky sod . ‘
41292	41301	41285	41285	Samuel	564	’ Kate scorns him on a small smile . ‘
41308	41375	41302	41302	I	363	’ he whines . I continue to direct my eyes all over Kate ’s workshop to avoid him . Jesse was right , he is an exhibitionist . He ’s completely naked , except for one of Kate ’s miniscule Cath Kidston aprons , and as he walks past me , my eyes drift and I get a right eyeful of his tight , naked butt . ‘
41384	41400	41401	41401	I	363	’ Kate moans , slapping his naked rump with a spatula full of cake mixture . ‘
41404	41412	41413	41413	I	363	’re going to dispose of that now ! ’
41467	41470	41455	41455	he	564	‘ Now you ’re
41480	41493	41494	41494	I	363	’ I jump out of the tub chair in a complete fluster . ‘
41500	41528	41530	41530	ya	643	’ I blurt , my voice high and squeaky . I do n’t want to witness the impending clean - up operation of Sam ’s caked buttocks . ‘
41532	41541	41530	41530	ya	643	’ Kate laughs as I make my escape . ‘
41549	41566	41530	41530	ya	643	’ Sam calls . I do n’t look back for fear of what I might see . ‘
41569	41606	41530	41530	ya	643	’ I shout , slamming the door behind me . Kate ’s short , curt response to my enquiries about The Manor is making my head spin . I do n’t want to even think what I ’m
41760	41833	41759	41759	You	647	’re a savage and a tease . You drive me crazy , I love you . Jx I drive him crazy ? The man is delusional . I fire a quick text to him ; I know u do . Flowers r beautiful . Thank u for the ride … 2 work . Ax I settle at my desk and bring up my email and list of things to do , but I ’m
41887	41892	41893	41893	I	363	‘ Shit shit shit ! ’
41901	41906	41907	41907	Patrick	564	‘ Morning , flower . ’
41913	41916	41907	41907	Patrick	564	‘ Morning , ’
41937	41945	41927	41927	I	363	‘ Did you have a good weekend ? ’
41970	41980	41964	41964	Patrick	564	‘ No , I bloody did n’t . Look ! ’
41999	42006	41998	41998	I	363	’m supposed to be looking at . ‘
42009	42040	42041	42041	Patrick	564	’ I ask . He points to his head , so I get out of my chair and lean up on my tiptoes , but I ca n’t see anything . ‘
42045	42046	42041	42041	Patrick	564	’ ‘
42053	42058	42059	42059	Patrick	564	’ He bends slightly . ‘
42067	42068	42059	42059	Patrick	564	’ ‘
42077	42101	42059	42059	Patrick	564	’ he says , his voice annoyed . I scan his mop of thick silver hair looking for a bald patch , but I ’m
42109	42118	42119	42119	I	363	‘ Patrick , there is no bald patch . ’
42123	42136	42137	42137	he	564	‘ Damn well would be if I did n’t take my vitamins . ’
42140	42144	42137	42137	he	564	‘ Nice flowers . ’
42145	42152	42153	42153	I	363	‘ Oh yes . My brother . ’
42169	42173	42174	42174	He	564	‘ How lovely . ’
42233	42293	42294	42294	Ava	0	’m now dreading having to go back to Doctor Monroe for the third time . This is ridiculous . With my phone in my hand , I decide I may as well get the one call I really do n’t want to make out of the way . I dial Matt , and it rings twice before he answers . ‘
42296	42314	42294	42294	Ava	0	’ He sounds pleased to hear from me . I want to smash his face in immediately . ‘
42326	42380	42317	42317	I	363	’ I get straight to the point . If I did n’t need my things , I would n’t call him at all . Just thinking of him makes my skin crawl ; talking to him has me physically itching . I was with him for four years . How did this happen ? ‘
42384	42396	42317	42317	I	363	’ He ’s too eager and it does n’t sit well . ‘
42410	42414	42417	42417	I	363	’ I ask . ‘
42423	42462	42417	42417	I	363	’ he replies cheerfully . I want to hiss down the phone at him , tell him exactly what I think of him , but I know he is probably expecting some sort of backlash from me . I ’m
42495	42502	42492	42492	you	652	‘ Great , see you then . ’
42527	42549	42526	42526	I	363	’m certainly not . Once I have the rest of my things , I wo n’t ever be seeing him again . ‘
42556	42637	42526	42526	I	363	’ he sings . He sounds almost smug . I shudder and hang up . If I could , I would send Kate around to get my things , but I know that will just end in tears and possible police intervention . I ’ll be in and out in ten minutes . I can resist the urge to pound on him for the short amount of time it ’s going to take me to gather my stuff and retreat . ‘
42645	42664	42643	42643	Ava	0	’ I look up and see Sally fiddling with her ponytail . There ’s something different about her . ‘
42676	42728	42729	42729	I	363	’ I ask . Why does she look different ? She shuffles on the spot and blushes ten shades of crimson , and then I notice that her high necked blouses have been replaced with a scoop neck top . Wow ! Sal has great tits ! Who would have thought ? ‘
42739	42808	42809	42809	Sal	59	’ She scuttles off to the kitchen . I grin to myself . Our dull , dreary Sal may have had some male action at the weekend . I put my phone down and start working through my files , ready for my appointment with Mr Van Der Haus on Wednesday . As ten thirty approaches , I gather my things to go on a few site visits . ‘
42831	42832	42823	42823	I	363	’ ‘
42836	42875	42876	42876	Darling	111	’ she sings enthusiastically , while filing some invoices . Yep , she ’s definitely had some male interest . Do men really have that impact on us women ? I pass Victoria and Tom at the door . ‘
42883	42887	42876	42876	Darling	111	’ Tom croons . ‘
42890	42899	42900	42900	I	363	’ I say , accepting his air kiss . ‘
42914	42915	42906	42906	I	363	’ ‘
42919	42925	42906	42906	I	363	’ Victoria barges past me . ‘
42932	42942	42946	42946	me	363	’ I ask Tom . Tom rolls his eyes . ‘
42977	42978	42979	42979	Drew	68	’ ‘
42981	42993	42994	42994	She	111	’ I ask . What ’s gone wrong ? Tom shrugs . ‘
43026	43047	42994	42994	She	111	’ I make my way to the tube and stop off at the chemist to replace my depleted gloss . I ’m
43106	43149	43105	43105	I	363	’m worried . Am I worried ? Jesse insists he ’s not an alcoholic and he certainly does n’t scramble for the hard stuff when he sees it . I buy the vitamins , anyway . They ca n’t hurt . When I ’m
43229	43232	43233	43233	I	363	‘ Hey . ’
43239	43246	43247	43247	He	363	‘ God , I miss you . ’
43268	43279	43280	43280	I	363	‘ Why did you send John to pick me up ? ’
43283	43291	43292	43292	he	363	‘ You did n’t have your car . ’
43297	43303	43296	43296	I	363	’m stupid for even asking . ‘
43311	43325	43307	43307	you	657	’ My tone is accusing . I did n’t mean it to be . ‘

43405	43416	43384	43384	you	657	’ I know that ’s what he wants to hear . ‘
43419	43424	43425	43425	Jesse	431	’ he asks hopefully . ‘
43428	43432	43425	43425	Jesse	431	’m at work . ’
43481	43485	43486	43486	he	431	‘ I know . ’
43490	43500	43486	43486	he	431	‘ What are you doing at this precise moment ? ’

43530	43548	43523	43523	I	363	’ I prompt . He might not be needed , but I have a diary to keep . ‘
43553	43580	43581	43581	I	363	’ He sounds so miserable , and I feel guilty for brushing him off . I stop outside my destination and look up to the heavens . ‘
43588	43604	43605	43605	I	363	’ I say , hoping this will placate him . He scoffs down the phone . ‘
43614	43625	43626	43626	I	363	’ I roll my eyes . Of course I do . ‘
43632	43633	43634	43634	You	59	’ ‘

43901	43923	43934	43934	Sal	59	’m dying to know what ’s put a huge smile on her face and provoked the introduction of scoop neck tops . ‘

44007	44013	44014	44014	I	363	‘ Nice . Who with ? ’
44023	44052	44053	44053	I	363	’m desperate to discover that our Sal – dull as dishwater , plaid skirt wearing , high necked bloused , office dogsbody – is a dominatrix or something . ‘
44058	44068	44053	44053	I	363	’ she says , maintaining her failing casual tone . ‘
44071	44093	44053	44053	I	363	’ I blurt . That came out so wrong . I did n’t mean to sound shocked , but I am . ‘
44105	44151	44053	44053	I	363	’ Internet dating ? I ’ve heard nothing but bad things about it . They look like an underwear model on their profile picture , but when they turn up they are more akin to a serial killer . Sal seems quite happy , though . ‘
44157	44167	44053	44053	I	363	’ I ask , biting into a chocolate digestive . ‘
44170	44189	44190	44190	He	666	’ she screams . I nearly choke on my biscuit . I ’ve never seen her so animated . ‘

44211	44217	44208	44208	Sal	59	’m really happy for you . ’

44438	44461	44437	44437	I	363	’m so sorry . I would have called , but I was in a meeting I could n’t get out of . I ’m

44579	44630	44633	44633	Clive	76	’m not here yet . I enter the foyer , weighed down with flowers and bags , and see Clive clicking various buttons on his high - tech surveillance system . I might just sit in one of the comfortable leather sofas and wait . What else can I do ? ‘

44649	44686	44643	44643	Ava	0	’ Rubbish ! I ’ve had a ridiculously busy day , I want to shower , get into my sweats and have a glass of wine . I can do none of those things , and I ’m

45048	45124	45047	45047	I	363	’m really not sure about it . I love him , but I fear living with him will just encourage his controlling behaviour and challenging ways . Or would he be better ? More reasonable ? My stomach does a little flip and a growl , reminding me that I should really get something to eat . I ’ve only picked on a few biscuits today . It ’s no wonder I feel exhausted . I ’m
45211	45216	45217	45217	I	363	‘ Are you okay ? ’
45411	45419	45399	45399	he	431	‘ Tell me how old you are . ’
45443	45447	45448	45448	he	431	‘ Thirty two . ’
45454	45458	45448	45448	he	431	‘ Tell me . ’
45459	45464	45465	45465	he	431	‘ Does it matter ? ’
45540	45561	45562	45562	He	431	‘ No , but I would like it if you told me . I know none of your basic information . ’
45568	45575	45562	45562	He	431	‘ You know I love you . ’
45628	45634	45635	45635	he	431	‘ How was your day ? ’
45645	45652	45635	45635	he	431	‘ Stupidly busy but very constructive . ’
45654	45679	45635	45635	he	431	’m quite pleased with what I managed to get done , considering I thought my day would be a bombardment of calls and texts . ‘
45691	45697	45681	45681	you	681	’ His head lifts and I ’m
45704	45713	45714	45714	I	363	‘ No . Have a bath with me . ’
45739	45745	45746	45746	He	431	‘ I ’d love to . ’
45766	45777	45759	45759	he	431	‘ You stay here , I ’ll sort the bath . ’
45827	45863	45826	45826	I	363	’m here . It ’s how attentive , loving and tender he is . Perhaps living with him would n’t be so bad after all . But then I give myself a quick reminder that I ’m
46012	46017	46006	46006	He	431	‘ Enjoying the view ? ’
46038	46041	46042	46042	I	363	‘ Always . ’
46067	46070	46071	46071	he	431	‘ Always , ’
46074	46078	46071	46071	he	431	‘ Come here . ’
46091	46096	46097	46097	he	431	‘ Leave the dress . ’
46162	46166	46152	46152	he	431	‘ Turn around . ’
46211	46218	46219	46219	he	431	‘ I really like this dress . ’
46389	46395	46396	46396	His	431	‘ I love your back . ’
46417	46424	46408	46408	He	431	‘ You have the softest skin . ’
46467	46470	46471	46471	he	431	‘ Lace ? ’
46493	46522	46492	46492	I	363	’m glass . Our tongues slip and slide over each other with little effort from either of us , and I lean back onto him for support . I ’m
46554	46562	46563	46563	He	431	‘ See what you do to me ? ’
46589	46598	46599	46599	I	363	‘ I ’ll die loving you , Ava . ’
46618	46679	46680	46680	You	687	’m excited and apprehensive about it all at once . It ’s the unknown . He is still unknown . I need more than his body , his attention … his challenging ways . He yanks the cups of my bra down , exposing my breasts , and skims the flats of his palms over the tips of my nipples . ‘
46684	46741	46680	46680	You	687	’ he breathes in my ear , sliding one of his hands down my front and straight to the apex of my thighs . My knees wobble when his hand cups me over my underwear , a deluge of liquid fire descending on me , my hips rolling forward against his hand to get more friction . ‘
46750	46751	46748	46748	Ava	0	’ ‘
46757	46771	46748	46748	Ava	0	’ I pant , and then moan as he thrusts his hips forward . ‘
46779	46795	46748	46748	Ava	0	’ he says quietly . I reach back and link my hands behind his neck . ‘
46802	46803	46797	46797	you	687	’ ‘
46806	46818	46797	46797	you	687	’ He hooks his thumbs in each side of my knickers . ‘
46823	46838	46797	46797	you	687	’ he whispers , dragging his tongue lightly down the edge of my ear . ‘
46843	46941	46797	46797	you	687	’ I agree quietly . I need nothing else except for him . I feel a sharp tug and a tear , and I look to see my knickers hanging from his index finger in front of me . He lets them slide off the end of his finger and takes his other hand to my hip . I jerk slightly , and he laughs in my ear . His fingers shift as his big hand wraps around my hip , spreading from my front to my back , his other hand hovering in front of me . ‘
46951	46962	46949	46949	Ava	0	’ He flexes his good hand in front of me . ‘
46966	47033	46949	46949	Ava	0	’ My hammering heart does nothing to regulate my short , sharp breaths . I want that hand on me . I remove my arm from around his neck and reach forward to take his hand , slowly guiding it down to the inside of my thigh and flattening his palm against my flesh with my hand over his . I feel him trembling faintly . I ’m
47209	47214	47215	47215	His	689	‘ Do n’t come . ’
47254	47277	47253	47253	I	363	’m desperate for him , but I ca n’t disobey him – not during these moments . My bra is unclasped and I ’m
47292	47301	47283	47283	he	689	‘ Promise me you ’ll never leave me . ’
47338	47345	47329	47329	he	689	‘ I ’ll never leave you . ’
47346	47350	47329	47329	he	689	‘ Promise me . ’
47351	47355	47356	47356	I	363	‘ I promise . ’
47481	47495	47496	47496	He	689	‘ I ca n’t wait anymore . I need to be inside you . ’
47532	47603	47531	47531	I	363	’m pushed up against the cold paint , feeling the hot , slippery crown of his erection pushing at my opening , breaching my entrance only a little . He breathes heavily and lets his head fall into my neck as if preparing himself for his invasion of me . I ca n’t wait . I swivel my hips and bore down on him , taking him all the way . ‘
47611	47676	47531	47531	I	363	’ he moans as he stills inside me . I want to tilt my hips and instigate movement , but I know from the jolting and twitching of him inside me that he ’s holding back . I keep still and sweep my hands through his dark blonde hair while he gathers himself , his heart pounding so hard I can almost hear it . ‘
47683	47692	47531	47531	I	363	’ He brings his face up to mine . ‘
47695	47833	47531	47531	I	363	’ I weave my fingers together around his neck and tighten my thighs . He growls with approval and releases his hands from my back , planting them onto the wall on either side of me . He slowly eases back on a steady breath , then plunges forward on a sharp exhale . I moan , the sensation of his hot , throbbing assault of me having me shifting my hands and clawing at his back . Resting his forehead against mine , he slowly begins rocking in and out of me . I sigh on every plunge as he works me up steadily . Oh fucking hell , he feels so good . My grip begins to slip on his sweat dampened skin , our breath mingling together in the close space between our mouths . ‘
47837	47891	47895	47895	woman	2631	’ he gasps , and I push my lips to his mouth , tackling his tongue . I feel a scream bubbling in my throat as he rears back and pushes forward sending me sliding up the wall . I clench my thighs to lift myself further and then bore down on him . ‘
47906	47933	47934	47934	I	363	’ He thrusts forward again and again , pushing me up the wall , swallowing my small cries as he kisses the life out of me . ‘
47942	47950	47934	47934	I	363	’ He hits me with another thrust . ‘
47962	47963	47934	47934	I	363	’ ‘
47971	47973	47976	47976	his	2631	’ I ’m

48000	48003	48004	48004	I	363	‘ Jesse ! ’
48005	48027	48028	48028	Ava	0	’m a despairing wreck . The calm smooth motions are fading fast , being replaced with firmer , more aggressive strikes . ‘
48032	48039	48045	48045	baby	0	’m going from now on , I ’m
48047	48054	48045	48045	baby	0	’ Thrust ! Holy Shit , I ’m
48066	48071	48072	48072	He	2631	‘ Shit , Ava ! ’
48085	48087	48072	48072	He	2631	‘ You ’re
48092	48093	48072	48072	He	2631	’ ‘
48096	48175	48176	48176	Ava	0	’ He mumbles in my mouth . I ca n’t hold back anymore . He strikes with ferocious power and I snap , the coils of pleasure peaking and firing off , my nails sinking into his flesh , my teeth gripping his lip harshly . I drop my forehead to his damp , salty skin where his neck meets his shoulder and rock my head from side to side as I jerk uncontrollably against his big body . ‘
48178	48289	48176	48176	Ava	0	’ he shouts , as he pulls back and then smashes forward , slowly withdrawing before hammering into me again , finding his own release as wave after wave of contractions sweep through me . He moans , then sinks us to the floor and falls onto his back , heaving and sweating . I drag myself up and sit astride of him , planting my hands on his slick chest and gently grinding myself on his hips . His arms fall back over his head as he looks up and watches me work us both down . We are both wet , out of breath and thoroughly satisfied . I ’m
48296	48303	48304	48304	he	363	‘ What are you thinking about ? ’
48312	48320	48304	48304	he	363	‘ About how much I love you . ’
48344	48353	48327	48327	His	363	‘ Do I still qualify as your God ? ’
48354	48363	48364	48364	I	363	‘ Always . Am I still your temptress ? ’
48374	48391	48392	48392	He	363	‘ That , baby , you most certainly are . God , I love your grin . ’
48408	48413	48414	48414	He	363	‘ Bath , God ? ’
48427	48435	48436	48436	He	363	‘ Shit ! It ’s still running ! ’
48463	48468	48453	48453	he	363	‘ Put me down ! ’
48486	48489	48480	48480	he	363	‘ Never . ’
48524	48541	48512	48512	He	363	‘ You could leave that bath running for a week and it would n’t be full . ’
48553	48576	48545	48545	he	363	‘ I know . The designer of all this Italian shit obviously has no regard for the environment or my carbon footprint . ’
48577	48584	48585	48585	I	363	‘ Says he with twelve superbikes . ’
48594	48619	48620	48620	I	363	’m sunk into the lovely relaxing water , still astride his lap , still full to the hilt with his semi - erect cock . ‘
48628	48729	48620	48620	I	363	’ I muse to myself , tracing my fingers from side to side across his abdomen . He lays back and lets me have my way . I run my fingertip over every square inch of his hard , lightly tanned chest , swirling and flicking as I go . The silence is comfortable as he watches my delicate touch skating all over him . I work my way up to his neck , his chin , his lips and they part , his eyes twinkling as I lower myself to rest on his chest , my mouth meeting his . ‘
48735	48752	48730	48730	I	363	’ I say , dropping kisses all the way around the edges of his lips until I ’m
48759	48765	48730	48730	I	363	‘ I love your body . ’
48780	48788	48730	48730	I	363	‘ I love your crazy mind too . ’
48825	48836	48822	48822	He	363	‘ You make me crazy , Ava . Just you . ’
48902	48905	48906	48906	I	363	‘ Crazy . ’
48909	48912	48913	48913	He	363	‘ ish , ’
48926	48933	48925	48925	I	363	’m sat between his parted thighs . ‘
48939	48964	48965	48965	I	363	’ He grabs the sponge and starts squeezing the hot water all over me , resting his cheek against the side of my head . ‘
48974	49013	48965	48965	I	363	’ he says quietly . There is no mistaking his apprehension . I tense all over . I do n’t like the sound of this , which is quite hilarious because I ’ve been willing him to talk . ‘
49016	49017	48965	48965	I	363	’ ‘
49021	49026	48965	48965	I	363	’ Okay , now I ’m
49061	49125	49060	49060	I	363	’m not going to like whatever is going to come from his mouth . He has ceased squeezing warm water over me , and I can literally hear those fucking cogs clanking around in his handsome head . What about The Manor ? I do not like the direction of tub talk today . I want to get out and have a shower . ‘
49130	49145	49060	49060	I	363	’ The worry is clear in his tone and it bloody should be . I ’m
49149	49154	49155	49155	I	363	‘ What about it ? ’
49160	49215	49216	49216	I	363	’m not going to get myself worked up because I really , really am not ever , not in a million years , going . Never – no way . I want to turn myself back over , lay on his chest and put my lips back on his so he ca n’t talk . ‘
49223	49224	49216	49216	I	363	’ ‘
49234	49241	49247	49247	he	701	’ I say calmly , but I ’m
49293	49303	49288	49288	she	703	‘ You asked me to go before I knew . ’
49304	49314	49315	49315	he	701	‘ I gave myself a deadline to tell you . ’
49319	49322	49315	49315	he	701	‘ Oh . ’
49340	49350	49351	49351	he	701	‘ Are you going to avoid my workplace forever ? ’
49369	49374	49375	49375	I	363	‘ I might do . ’
49387	49395	49396	49396	He	701	‘ Do n’t be stupid , Ava . ’
49410	49419	49396	49396	He	701	‘ Will you please just think about it ? ’
49424	49426	49420	49420	I	363	‘ I ’m
49448	49451	49452	49452	I	363	’m leaving . ’
49456	49497	49455	49455	I	363	’m being completely dramatic , but I want him to know how much I do n’t want to go . The Manor anniversary party ? Never . He nuzzles my ear and wraps his legs around the outside of mine . ‘
49510	49618	49620	49620	you	707	’ Oh God ! That ’s emotional blackmail if ever there was any . How the hell can I say no to that ? Damn you , Jesse Ward , of an age I do n’t know . I let him continue to wash me while I think about using this to my advantage . Maybe I could negotiate his age from him in return for my presence at The Manor ’s anniversary party . I ’ll think carefully about how much I want to know his age compared to how much I do n’t want to go to the party . That ’s a tricky one . ‘
49625	49636	49620	49620	you	707	’ I ask . I know he has n’t . I ’m
49640	49644	49620	49620	you	707	‘ About what ? ’
49645	49650	49620	49620	you	707	‘ The mystery woman . ’
49651	49672	49620	49620	you	707	‘ No , Ava , I did n’t have time . I promise you I will ask , though . I ’m
49686	49713	49683	49683	you	707	’ He circles his tongue around my ear . It could send me to sleep . At least he has n’t lied about talking to Clive . ‘
49716	49724	49683	49683	you	707	’ I answer on a yawn . I ’m
49733	49738	49739	49739	I	363	’m not giving in . ‘
49740	49754	49732	49732	I	363	’m not going to sleep until you tell me who that woman was . ’
49755	49767	49739	49739	I	363	‘ How can I tell you if I do n’t know ? ’
49768	49773	49739	49739	I	363	‘ You do know . ’
49774	49781	49782	49782	I	363	‘ I do n’t fucking know ! ’

49807	49826	49739	49739	I	363	’ I say quietly . But it ’s not . I ’ll speak to Clive in the morning . ‘
49833	49837	49739	49739	I	363	’ he whispers . ‘
49841	49858	49859	49859	You	708	’ He bites at my earlobe , smoothing the soles of his feet down my shins . ‘
49872	49873	49859	49859	You	708	’ ‘
49883	49947	49859	49859	You	708	’ he asks . No , I ca n’t , but I notice he does n’t offer . Then again , he has openly admitted that cooking is one of the only things he ’s crap at . What were his words ? Oh yes … I ca n’t be amazing at everything . He was serious as well , the arrogant arse . ‘
49951	49960	49961	49961	I	363	’ I agree . He shifts under me . ‘
49972	50015	49967	49967	you	708	’ He lifts himself out of the bath and leaves me in the massive tub by myself . I watch his wet nakedness stroll out of the bathroom , returning a few moments later with some women ’s shampoo and conditioner . I ’m
50043	50047	50048	50048	He	363	‘ Wear lace . ’
50098	50156	50097	50097	I	363	’m immediately aware of Jesse ’s absence in the bed . Propping myself up on my elbows , I spy him sat on the chaise lounge , bending down . Oh no ! I lay back down as quietly as I possibly can and shut my eyes . He might not have noticed I woke – if I ’m
50270	50277	50269	50269	I	363	’m turned over onto my back . ‘
50281	50302	50269	50269	I	363	’ he chirps , and I screw my face up in disgust at his cheery , break of dawn happiness . ‘
50309	50319	50269	50269	I	363	’ I plead , pulling my most solemn face . ‘
50324	50382	50383	50383	I	363	’ He grabs my hand with his good one and pulls me into a sitting position . I make a big display of moaning in repulsion at his idea of starting the day , and then nearly start crying when he presents me with my freshly laundered running kit that he , so generously , bought me . ‘
50388	50392	50383	50383	I	363	’ I complain . ‘
50395	50417	50383	50383	I	363	’ He hoofs me off the bed and draws my lace knickers down my legs before tapping my ankles to lift . ‘
50424	50446	50449	50453	a quick few miles girl	712	’ he states firmly . It ’s all right for him . He runs stupid distances on a daily basis . I ’m
50465	50476	50449	50453	a quick few miles girl	712	‘ Hey ! Are you trying to tell me something ? ’
50511	50521	50501	50501	he	363	‘ Shut up , Ava . If anything , you ’re
50528	50554	50501	50501	he	363	’ he scolds me . He ’s right , I am . I let him dress me in my shorts , vest top and trainers . ‘
50559	50563	50501	50501	he	363	’ I grumble . ‘
50569	50630	50631	50631	I	363	’ He slaps my bum , and I head off into the bathroom , dragging my feet and rolling my head back to make a point of my disgruntled mood . I clean my teeth , locate a hair bobble from my bag and make my way down the stairs to find him at the front door waiting for me . ‘
50632	50637	50638	50638	I	363	’m just a hindrance . ’
50670	50679	50680	50680	He	715	‘ I ’ll never do the full fourteen . ’
50696	50713	50714	50714	He	715	‘ You ’ll never be a hindrance to me , I like having you with me . ’
50745	50754	50755	50755	I	363	‘ You need to get that code changed . ’
50783	50786	50787	50787	he	715	‘ Nag . ’
50905	50908	50909	50909	I	363	‘ Ready ? ’
50939	50943	50944	50944	he	715	‘ Just think , ’
50959	50968	50969	50969	I	363	‘ We can do this together every morning . ’
51002	51054	51001	51001	I	363	’m reminded of the relaxing advantages of running at this time of day . It really is very peaceful and mind cleansing . I glance up at my beautiful man every now and again in the hope that he is at least displaying some sign of fatigue . Of course , I ’m
51202	51293	51195	51195	he	715	’m doing . I feel okay , as it happens , but if he increases his pace , then it might be a different story . We conquer The Green Park and make our way onto Piccadilly , passing the point at which I collapsed the last time . I glance across to the spot where I sat every morning , picking at the grass and soaking up the dew through my trousers . I can see myself there – a pasty , empty waif – a half complete woman . ‘
51296	51314	51316	51316	he	715	’ I snap from my daydream and look up at Jesse , finding a concerned face . I ’m
51322	51325	51326	51326	I	363	‘ Fine . ’
51351	51399	51350	51350	I	363	’m going to do this . I feel Jesse ’s elbow nudge me , and I glance up to see a look of recognition to my achievement on his non - sweaty face , but then I do a quick calculation in my head and figure that we ’re
51447	51502	51446	51446	I	363	’m not going to do this . I battle on for a few hundred yards and then enter the park at the next entrance , dramatically collapsing on the damp grass … again . I heave valuable air into my scorching lungs and pant like a dog on heat . I must look like I ’m
51540	51548	51524	51524	I	363	‘ I did better than last time . ’
51562	51568	51569	51569	He	431	‘ You did , baby . ’
51599	51601	51604	51604	you	431	‘ I ’m
51618	51697	51612	51612	you	431	’ What ? My eyes bulge under my closed lids . If I had enough breath , I would cough in disgust . Has this man ever heard of the term , baby steps ? I lay on the grass as he works his magic hands on every burning muscle . I could lie here all day , but all too soon , he pulls me up into a sitting position and waves a twenty under my nose . ‘
51704	51772	51612	51612	you	431	’ He nods past me , and I look to see a Starbucks over the road . I could kiss him . I throw my arms around him in gratitude for his forward thinking . I ’ve been rubbed back to life , and now I get a Starbucks . The run was worth it . He laughs and stands with me still wrapped around his neck . ‘
51777	51882	51612	51612	you	431	’ he demands softly , unlinking my arms from him . I comply immediately , remembering the last time he told me to stretch after our run – I did n’t . I was too busy being distracted by his unreasonable demand to have me work at The Manor constantly . As a result , I spent all day drawing my foot up to my backside to try and alleviate some of the aching . He stands and watches me as I see through my muscle stretches . He looks so happy , his eyes twinkling , his frown line nowhere to be seen . ‘
51886	51909	51612	51612	you	431	’ He takes my hand and we stroll over to Starbucks , getting served super quick due to the early hour . I ’m
51918	51945	51917	51917	I	363	’m only going to load my body back up with the calories I ’ve just burned off . Everything smells so fresh and yummy , though . ‘
51953	51968	51917	51917	I	363	’ Jesse asks . He must have seen me staring longingly at the pastries . ‘
51971	52024	51917	51917	I	363	’ I answer quickly , dragging my eyes away from the mouthwatering temptations in the glass cabinet . He smiles and wraps his palm around the back of my neck , pulling me into him and resting his lips on my forehead before turning his attention back to the swooning sales clerk . ‘
52045	52065	51917	51917	I	363	’ He smiles brightly at the young girl , who giggles nervously . He returns his eyes to me . ‘
52072	52073	52074	52074	I	363	’ ‘
52081	52082	52074	52074	I	363	’ ‘
52092	52254	52087	52087	Ava	0	’ I shake my head at him , but do n’t argue . Instead , I find a window seat and flop down in the leather couch . What a perfect way to start the day , ten mile run aside . I would still take sleepy sex over this , though . I would take sleepy sex over anything . My mind starts drifting to Jesse ’s plea for me to go to The Manor ’s party . What sort of party would it be , anyway ? Visions of semi - naked people , all milling around , springs to mind , along with hazy , dim lighting and erotic music . Oh yes , and grid - like contraptions , hooks , hoists … whips . Fucking hell ! It would be like a giant gang - bang with kinky toys ! Oh Jesus good Lord above . Not only do I not want to go myself , I ’m
52330	52341	52329	52329	I	363	’m having complete mental breakdown in Starbucks , and again I ’m
52434	52437	52438	52438	I	363	‘ Dreaming ? ’
52558	52578	52579	52579	I	363	’m not . We have n’t even talked about The Manor . We have n’t talked about anything really . ‘
52580	52587	52588	52588	I	363	’m not coming to the party . ’
52594	52606	52588	52588	I	363	‘ I love you , but I ca n’t do that . ’
52708	52724	52725	52725	he	736	‘ It ’s not going to be how you think it will be , Ava . ’
52729	52735	52725	52725	he	736	‘ How do you mean ? ’
52781	52796	52753	52753	He	736	‘ Has The Manor ever given you the impression of a seedy sex club ? ’
52797	52800	52801	52801	I	363	‘ No . ’
52869	52901	52863	52864	this man	363	‘ Ava , there wo n’t be people wandering around naked and propositioning you . You wo n’t be manhandled up the stairs to the communal room . There are rules . ’
52904	52912	52913	52913	I	363	‘ What do you mean by rules ? ’
52914	52921	52913	52913	I	363	’m frowning again . He smiles . ‘
52996	53000	53004	53004	I	363	’ I know I ’m
53009	53016	53017	53017	I	363	‘ What ’s your sexual preference ? ’
53101	53104	53105	53105	he	751	‘ You . ’
53109	53113	53105	53105	he	751	‘ Just me ? ’
53114	53120	53121	53121	His	751	‘ Just you , Ava . ’
53158	53161	53153	53153	I	363	‘ Good . ’
53268	53273	53274	53274	he	751	‘ You ’ll come ? ’
53290	53293	53294	53294	he	751	‘ Please . ’
53311	53318	53319	53319	His	751	‘ Only because I love you . ’
53334	53339	53328	53328	I	363	‘ Say it again . ’
53340	53348	53349	53349	I	363	‘ What ? That I ’ll come ? ’
53352	53370	53349	53349	I	363	‘ Oh , you ’ll come all right . No , tell me you love me again . ’
53371	53375	53376	53376	I	363	‘ I do . ’
53379	53384	53385	53385	He	751	‘ I love you . ’
53388	53401	53402	53402	He	751	‘ I know you do . I love hearing you say it . ’
53430	53452	53425	53425	he	751	‘ If you had kept running , we would be at home by now and I would be lost inside you . ’
53483	53606	53482	53482	I	363	’m gagging for an encore to my morning workout . He drops a long lingering kiss on my lips and then proceeds to toss me onto his shoulder and stride out to the street . I catch a glimpse of the young girl who served Jesse , looking longingly at me being carted out over the shoulder of my Adonis . I smile to myself . This is what every woman wants , and I have it . No one is taking him away from me , so if I have to go to the stupid anniversary party just to fight off the pack of lions waiting to sink their claws into him , then I will . I ’ll trample . I ’m
53635	53649	53652	53652	Clive	76	’m fidgeting to try and dispel the buzzing hijacking me between my thighs . ‘
53654	53720	53652	53652	Clive	76	’ Jesse says urgently as he pulls me along behind him . It ’s a good job I have trainers on ; he may as well be sprinting . He does n’t slow up when Clive calls his hello . He bundles me into the elevator , smashes his code into the keypad and pins me against the mirrored wall , attacking my mouth hungrily . ‘
53733	53826	53721	53721	I	363	’ he growls into my mouth . His primal tone has me falling to pieces under his hard body . My hands are fisted in his hair and pressing his mouth closer to mine , our tongues urgently battling in our mouths . This is going to be a shock and awe moment . We are way past sleepy sex territory and if those elevator doors do n’t open soon , it might be right here in the lift . The doors slide open , as if hearing my thoughts , and I ’m
53866	53930	53855	53855	he	761	’m having my sweaty running kit ripped from my body before the door is closed . He wants in quick which is absolutely fine by me . That was the longest taxi ride I ’ve ever endured . I kick my trainers off as he yanks my shorts down my legs , and I start pulling his vest up over his head . I ’m
53981	53993	53994	53994	he	761	‘ On your knees , put your hands on the wall . ’
54073	54083	54056	54056	He	761	‘ Do n’t come until I say . Understand ? ’
54103	54233	54236	54236	Jesse	431	’m about to welcome into my body . I should know by now that when he is like this , no amount of mental psyching up can prepare me for him . I feel the head of his cock pushing at my entrance and as soon as he ’s leveled it up , he pounds forward on a garbled yell . He gives me no breathing space to adjust or accept him . He immediately yanks me back onto him and begins to piston in and out of me ruthlessly . He ’s a man possessed . Holy fucking shit ! My eyes fly open in shock and I shift my hands on the wall , desperately trying to steady myself as he continues to wildly buck into me . ‘
54238	54249	54236	54236	Jesse	431	’ I scream around the delightful invasion of my body . ‘
54259	54266	54257	54257	Ava	0	’ he barks , smashing on . ‘
54274	54325	54257	54257	Ava	0	’ I try and focus on anything but the immense , fast accumulation of pressure that ’s building up in my groin , but his relentless and barbaric strikes are not helping my desperate situation . I wo n’t be able to hold out for long at this riotous rate . ‘
54328	54333	54257	54257	Ava	0	’ he roars frenziedly . ‘
54336	54349	54257	54257	Ava	0	’ He punctuates each word with a hard , sharp thrust . I ’m
54389	54411	54388	54388	I	363	’m delirious with pleasure . The telltale signs of him tensing travels through his arms , straight to my shoulders . I ’m
54415	54505	54414	54414	I	363	’m past the point of return , but I ca n’t fully let go until I get the okay . What the hell would he do if I defied him and gave in to my demanding release , anyway ? He continues to buck and slap against me and on an ear piercing roar , he slams into me with such force , tears stab at my eyes . He stills and leans against my back , pushing me forward onto the wall , circling his hips deeply . I ’m
54567	54570	54571	54571	he	762	‘ Come . ’
54645	54651	54637	54637	him	762	‘ You are a God . ’
54680	54682	54675	54675	his	762	‘ You ’re
54686	54687	54688	54688	You	762	’ ‘
54689	54694	54695	54695	He	762	’re an arrogant God . ’
54721	54731	54732	54732	He	762	‘ Your arrogant God loves you so fucking much . ’
54740	54761	54762	54762	He	762	‘ Your arrogant God wants to spend the rest of his life smothering you with his love and his body . ’
54773	54778	54772	54772	I	363	’m delighted , but I ’m
54808	54814	54815	54815	I	363	‘ What ’s the time ? ’
54824	54830	54831	54831	He	762	‘ I do n’t know . ’
54880	54883	54871	54871	I	363	‘ Shit ! ’
54884	54892	54893	54893	I	363	‘ Hey ! Watch your fucking mouth ! ’
54906	54914	54915	54915	I	363	‘ It ’s a quarter to eight ! ’
54945	54972	54944	54944	I	363	’m going to be super late . I throw myself in the shower and make quick work of ridding my body of sweat and cum . I ’m
55011	55015	55016	55016	I	363	‘ Do n’t . ’
55020	55046	55047	55047	I	363	’m not being distracted by him anymore . He pouts and works his hands up to my shoulders , yanking me forward onto his mouth . ‘
55048	55054	55055	55055	I	363	’m going to be late . ’
55074	55082	55083	55083	he	431	‘ I want to make an appointment . ’
55098	55107	55083	55083	he	431	‘ To fuck me ? No appointment necessary . ’
55125	55154	55118	55118	He	431	‘ Mouth ! I already told you , I do n’t need to make an appointment to fuck you . I do that whenever and wherever I please . ’
55176	55181	55175	55175	I	363	’m swallowed up again . ‘
55188	55302	55175	55175	I	363	’ I duck out of his hold and hastily leave him in the shower , sulking like a schoolboy . He just had me , although I could go again too . I brush my teeth and make my way into the bedroom , sitting myself in front of the floor length mirror with my make - up bag and hair dryer . I commence a fast blast dry , quickly pin it up and start applying my make - up . Jesse walks out of the bathroom , gloriously naked and unashamed . I scowl at his naked back , dragging my eyes away to continue with my make - up . I ’m
55518	55520	55510	55510	I	363	‘ You ’re
55523	55528	55529	55529	You	767	’ he says softly . ‘
55533	55563	55529	55529	You	767	’ I reply , tensing slightly when I feel his hardness pushing into my lower back . He fights a smile , knowing damn well what he ’s doing . ‘
55570	55577	55529	55529	You	767	’ I knew this was coming . ‘
55583	55587	55529	55529	You	767	’ He pouts . ‘
55607	55623	55627	55627	I	363	’ I could think of nothing better , but if I relent on this , I ’m
55628	55662	55663	55663	I	363	’m setting a rod for my own back . He ca n’t keep me to himself all of the time , although I know he does n’t think that his ambition is unreasonable . ‘
55668	55685	55686	55686	I	363	’ I say , clenching my eyes shut when he turns his lips into my ear . ‘
55692	55711	55712	55712	Jesse	431	’ He circles his tongue lightly in my ear . Oh God , I need to escape now ! ‘
55716	55731	55712	55712	Jesse	431	’ I wriggle in his embrace . He scowls at me in the mirror . ‘
55737	55738	55741	55741	I	363	’ ‘
55742	55746	55747	55747	I	363	’m delaying you . ’
55792	55800	55786	55786	he	431	‘ I need to work , God . ’
55801	55813	55814	55814	I	363	‘ Work me . I ’ll be a very grateful client . ’
55820	55850	55851	55851	His	431	‘ You mean to say that instead of busting a gut keeping clients happy with drawings , plans and schedules , I should just jump into bed with them ? ’
55856	55866	55851	55851	His	431	‘ Do n’t say things like that , Ava . ’
55867	55873	55874	55874	I	363	‘ It was a joke . ’
55878	55887	55877	55877	I	363	’m flipped over and pinned under his body . ‘
55905	55906	55907	55907	I	363	’ ‘
55908	55911	55912	55912	I	363	’m sorry . ’

56181	56231	56180	56180	I	363	’m being distracted again . I throw my bag on the bed , retrieve my phone , sweep some gloss across my lips and grab my shoes , all under his watchful eye . I have another futile rummage through my bag for my pills , but I know I ’m
56236	56240	56241	56241	He	771	‘ Lost something ? ’
56252	56256	56257	56257	I	363	‘ My pills . ’
56286	56289	56271	56271	I	363	‘ Again ? ’
56305	56327	56304	56304	I	363	’m not relishing the thought of visiting Doctor Monroe again . I need to sort that today before I miss anymore . ‘
56334	56439	56442	56442	Clive	76	’ He lands me with a chaste kiss on my cheek and leaves me to carry on searching for rips in the lining of my bag . What a nightmare . Maybe I should just get the jab and save myself all of this embarrassment . I freeze on the spot , my brow furrowing , my mind jumping the gun … I think . No , he would n’t . Why ever would he ? Chapter 9 As I walk into the foyer , I find Clive rubbing the cuff of his jacket on the marble desk , buffing it to a shine . ‘

56552	56563	56543	56543	Jesse	431	’ He shakes his head and keeps his eyes down . ‘

57323	57361	57322	57322	I	363	’m digging myself a hole here – I do realise that , but he ’s out of touching distance so there is no risk of any sort of Jesse style fucking to put me in my place . ‘

He ’s taken me on a ten mile run , served me my favourite coffee , fucked me into oblivion and made filthy promises on the phone , and I have n’t even got to work yet . On top of that , though , he ’s distracting me from a whole heap of troubling thoughts . He ’s holding back on me again , and I ca n’t believe he has advised the concierge that I am now the lady of the house . I need to avoid all sense fucking in future , and I need to think about how I ’m

57719	57725	57712	57712	John	564	‘ What do you think ? ’
57732	57738	57739	57739	I	363	‘ How old is Jesse ? ’
57767	57771	57772	57772	John	564	‘ Thirty two . ’

57838	57845	57829	57829	John	564	‘ He said you would ask . ’
57852	57881	57883	57883	he	431	’m at a total loss on that subject , so I decide , as John seems like he ’s in a talkative mood , to take another angle . ‘

57957	57967	57968	57968	I	363	‘ I obviously bring out the worst in him . ’

58093	58121	58122	58122	I	363	’m not so sure . It ’s a bit soon . That ’s what that little spat was about . He does n’t like being told no . ’

She rolls her eyes , and I give her an apologetic shrug . After exchanging flowers and signatures , I retrieve the card . Looking forward to your retribution fuck ? Your God . X I smile and send him a text . I promised myself no contact after he distracted me this morning , but that plan has already been tossed out the window , what with Molly mops and Big John . And anyway , I really am looking forward to my retribution fuck . Yes I am and yes u are . Your Ax I knuckle down . With the office empty except for Sal , I have the perfect opportunity to get lots done . I run across the road at lunchtime to grab a bagel and eat it at my desk . My phone declares a text when I land back in my chair . I particularly like your sign off . Do n’t forget it . You always will be . See you at home about 7 … ish Jx I ’m

59104	59119	59079	59079	we	795	’ I blurt . Her oversensitivity on this matter is making me super suspicious . ‘

59443	59472	59442	59442	They	800	’re a fashion statement and Tom ’s attempt to appear professional . Professional ? He should lose the shirt and tie combo . It ’s making me squint . ‘

59488	59497	59442	59442	They	800	’ I nod . His eyes bulge again . ‘
59506	59522	59503	59503	he	70	’ I recoil , suddenly feeling extremely guilty for engaging him in such a conversation . ‘
59531	59591	59529	59529	Tom	70	’ I scorn . Sally walks through the office , stopping our gossip dead in its tracks . Tom raises his eyebrows and grins as he follows her path to the photocopier . If I was close enough , I would kick him . He turns back to me , catching my disapproving expression and holds his hands up . ‘
59594	59615	59529	59529	Tom	70	’ he mouths . I shake my head and return to my computer , but my peace is short lived . ‘
59618	59625	59626	59626	Victoria	67	’ Tom calls from his desk . ‘
59637	59716	59626	59626	Victoria	67	’ I look up from my screen in shock and see him casually flicking through a catalogue . How does she know ? Of course … Drew . He and Victoria were together on Friday night , but what has happened since then to put her in such a foul mood ? I do n’t want to engage in this conversation . Tom thrives on drama , and my life is really quite a drama at the moment . ‘
59735	59750	59733	59733	Tom	70	’ I carry on deleting junk emails . He does n’t take the hint . ‘
59765	59774	59778	59778	Tom	70	’ he muses thoughtfully , still flicking pages . ‘
59780	59818	59778	59778	Tom	70	’ I glare at him when he lifts his eyes from the catalogue he ’s not even reading . He takes the hint this time , carrying on about his business . I do n’t know how I ’m
59914	59945	59946	59946	I	363	’m amazing ! I jump up from my desk and quickly clear it of drawings and files . I grab my bag and flowers and head for the office door . ‘
59947	59956	59957	59957	I	363	’m done , see you tomorrow , guys . ’
60085	60137	60084	60084	I	363	’m careful not to wet my hair as I frantically wash the day away and not so frantically shave , before removing myself from the enclosure and reaching up to grab a towel . I turn , slamming straight into a familiar , solid and very naked chest . Oh shit ! ‘
60143	60185	60084	60084	I	363	’ His voice is low and threatening . I slowly lift my gaze to his and find hooded , dark green eyes and a deadly serious expression . Dominant Jesse has arrived , and he has completely screwed my plans up . ‘
60189	60193	60084	60084	I	363	’ I admit . ‘
60206	60213	60214	60214	I	363	’re going to do it now . ’
60228	60285	60227	60227	I	363	’m completely and utterly gutted that he has caught me like this , but my disappointment does n't prevent the stab of pleasure that ’s just shot from deep in my stomach , straight into my groin . His menacing , lean frame towering all over me , accompanied by his heavy breathing , tells me I ’m
60300	60307	60308	60308	I	363	‘ What if I say no ? ’
60327	60339	60340	60340	You	814	’m totally calling his bluff , and he probably knows it . ‘
60344	60358	60359	60359	I	363	’ His self - assured tone pumps the blood faster through my veins . ‘
60362	60430	60359	60359	I	363	’ I so wo n’t and my small voice confirms this . He pushes himself into me , the warm , slippery head of his erection probing at my lower stomach , prompting a small gasp of air to escape my mouth . His eyes burn with dark promise as I wait for him to make his move , anticipation having the muscles at my core convulsing . ‘
60450	60489	60439	60439	We	815	’ His fingertip trails the length of my wet arm , across my shoulder and up my neck until it reaches the hollow void under my ear . I close my eyes . He ’s got me again . ‘
60498	60540	60496	60496	Ava	0	’ His voice is silky smooth , but sure and serious . I open my eyes on a frown . What is he on about ? I ’ve never thought about things happening for a reason . What ’s his point ? ‘
60543	60548	60549	60549	I	363	’ I answer honestly . ‘
60552	60568	60569	60569	I	363	’ He reaches down and cups me , his hot touch making me tense further . ‘
60573	60599	60600	60600	He	363	’re supposed to be here with me , so you advising the concierge that you do n’t live here just fucks … me … off . ’
60668	60685	60688	60688	God	81	’m sliced in two by waves of pleasure . He slowly inserts two fingers inside me . ‘
60690	60765	60688	60688	God	81	’ I moan , my head falling back , the towel dropped in favour of Jesse ’s shoulders . He takes advantage of the access to my neck and bends , pressing his lips to the centre of my throat , licking a firm , wet stroke all of the way up to my chin , his fingers sweeping big punishing circles inside me , stretching me . He ’s preparing me for him . ‘
60767	60778	60779	60779	His	363	’m going to fuck you until you scream , Ava . ’
60805	60885	60804	60804	I	363	’m not sure whether I should be afraid . Would n’t a reminder fuck remedy this little situation ? He yanks my face down to meet his eyes . He ’s in control , but so frenzied too . I do n’t know what to make of it . The only thing I seem to be able to concentrate on is the wildfire spreading throughout my body and slamming straight between my thighs on a powerful , determined thud . ‘
60900	61022	60896	60896	Face	125	’ He throws his order at me , and I follow through immediately , taking myself to the bed , kneeling and resting my backside on my heels . What has he got planned ? I feel his chest press up against my back and he reaches in front of me , clasping my hands and flattening my palms . Then he guides them to my breasts and circles my palms over my nipples so they lightly skim the tips , the burning friction having me pushing my breasts forward to get better contact , but he just tusks me and pulls my hands further away . I protest with a disjointed cry . He pushes his mouth to my ear . ‘
61028	61046	61024	61024	you	818	’ he asks . The question throws me . Of course I do . More than anyone . ‘
61051	61062	61024	61024	you	818	’ I confirm . I hear him growl in approval . ‘
61071	61121	61069	61069	Ava	0	’ What ? Before I have a chance to register what is happening , my arms are yanked behind my back and a pair of handcuffs are snapped over my wrists . Where the fuck did they come from ? I jiggle my wrists , hearing the metal clank . ‘
61129	61254	61255	61256	Good girl	819	’ he chastises me , letting my hands rest at the top of my bum . Oh , Jesus fucking Christ ! I ’ve never mentally swore so much . This is so unexpected and has just blown my truth fuck right out of the fucking water ! He ’s never used play things before . I do and I do n’t want to stop this , but I ca n’t seem to utter the words . I still myself and try my hardest to relax my arms , while I consider whether he ’s done this before . I inwardly laugh . Of course he has , you stupid woman . Why did n’t I see this coming ? He leans into me . ‘
61258	61355	61357	61357	Jesse	124	’ He pulls my pins out of my hair and runs his hands through my long waves , spreading them across my bare back . I shiver and try to steady my erratic breathing . It ’s no good . My heart is sprinting in my chest and nothing is going to slow it down . This is unknown territory to me . I have never , not for a minute , allowed myself to consider the prospect of being trussed up , defenseless and at a man ’s mercy . This is ironic really . I ’m
61397	61432	61365	61365	He	819	’re heading ? I enjoyed it last time , but I was n’t handcuffed then . I feel his arm wrap around my lower stomach and then his other hand press into my back . ‘
61437	61451	61434	61434	you	821	’ he says softy as he eases me down to the mattress . I ’m
61470	61476	61469	61469	I	363	’m completely exposed and vulnerable . ‘
61488	61520	61521	61521	I	363	’ His tone is full of approval , but I ’ll take his word for it . This really is not me . But still , I ca n’t stop it . ‘
61522	61530	61531	61531	He	363	’m not going to take your arse . ’
61597	61602	61603	61603	he	363	‘ Do n’t move . ’
61636	61644	61645	61645	His	363	‘ You want it all the way ? ’
61660	61666	61659	61659	I	363	’m desperate for full penetration . ‘
61669	61719	61659	61659	I	363	’ I splutter . Oh God , help me . He withdraws his half submerged arousal , and I moan at the loss of fullness . I need all of him . I push myself back impulsively and then feel the sharp thrash of his hand across my backside . ‘
61722	61753	61659	61659	I	363	’ I scream . The sting radiates across my cheek and my shoulders tense against the bed . What the hell ? He pushes into me but only halfway again . ‘
61756	61760	61659	61659	I	363	’ he spits . ‘
61765	61780	61781	61781	Jesse	124	’ I start gasping as the sting mingles with the delicious semi - invasion . ‘
61783	61787	61788	61788	I	363	’ I plead . ‘
61791	61823	61788	61788	I	363	’ He skates his palm across my cheek as he withdraws again , and I clench my eyes shut , willing my body to relent to my brains instructions to relax . ‘
61830	61902	61788	61788	I	363	’ I whimper into the mattress as I pull at the handcuffs . It ’s too much and it ’s come out of the blue . Or has it ? Oh , I do n’t know . I know his business , I know he can be animalistic during sex and I love that , but he can also be romantic , gentle and loving . Is this the next level ? ‘
61913	61916	61917	61917	He	822	’re with . ’
61949	61960	61961	61961	he	822	‘ What did I say you would do , Ava ? ’
62018	62022	62010	62010	He	822	‘ Answer me ! ’
62031	62040	62023	62023	he	822	‘ Scream ! You said I would scream ! ’
62052	62057	62047	62047	he	822	‘ Are you screaming ? ’
62058	62061	62062	62062	He	822	‘ Yes ! ’

62115	62123	62124	62124	he	822	‘ Where do you live , Ava ? ’
62234	62244	62245	62245	He	822	‘ Ava ! Where the fuck do you live ? ’
62252	62266	62251	62251	I	363	’m numb . Numb with complete , intense , mind - blowing bliss . ‘

62278	62282	62283	62283	I	363	’ I shout . ‘

62295	62438	62292	62292	you	363	’ His palm collides with my cheek again , reinforcing his words , before he ’s clenching my hips again and pulling me back on each and every hard , punishing blow against my body . Sparks start launching , the pressure at my core set to detonate loudly . I scream in delighted despair . This is way past severe . I really wo n’t be able to walk tomorrow . Is this part of his plan to keep me at home because if so , it ’s going to work . I feel his palm collide with my arse again and that last stinging slap rockets me into the most powerful , splintering climax I ’ve ever experienced . I scream … very loudly – an echo around the room , sore throat , despairing , thrilling , satisfied scream . ‘
62441	62469	62292	62292	you	363	’ Jesse roars . I feel him tense , and then the grinding circles of his hips against my backside . He moans . I moan . I ’m
62537	62546	62536	62536	I	363	’m surprised at myself and my revelation . I ’m
62571	62619	62620	62620	Friends	363	’m glad I saw it through . That has just proved , beyond a doubt , I could never deny him . He lays his arms over mine and dots light kisses at the nape of my neck while moaning and lazily gyrating his hips into me . ‘
62622	62653	62620	62620	Friends	363	’ he whispers softly in my ear , nibbling my lobe . His soft velvet voice is a million miles away from the brutal sex Lord I ’ve just encountered . ‘
62660	62665	62620	62620	Friends	363	’ I ask . I ’m
62729	62733	62734	62734	friends	490	‘ Tell me we ’re

62938	62999	63003	63003	my	363	’ I agree . Snuggle ? Is he kidding me ? After that ? This man is like the sex version of Jekyll and Hyde . He gives me a light kiss before peeling himself away from me , and I crawl up the bed , settling on my front and reveling in his scent all over the sheets . I ’m
63049	63174	63175	63175	Baby	93	’m way too tired to pursue my truth fuck now . I roll over onto my back , staring up at the ceiling and battle away the unwanted thoughts that are raiding my exhausted mind . How many women ? I ’ve maintained I do n’t want to know the answer to that question – the one that keeps popping up , uninvited and pointlessly into my brain . But unreasonable curiosity is making its unwanted presence hard to ignore . If I was n’t so shattered , I might give that direction of thought more attention , but I am , so I close my eyes and quietly thank Jesse for draining me of any energy to pursue my unreasonable fit of curiosity . ‘

63631	63671	63630	63630	I	363	’m talking about the possibility of him meeting my parents . I ca n’t even begin to think about how my Mum and Dad will take to Jesse . Yes , he can turn the charm on , but I ’m

64266	64282	64283	64283	I	363	’ What ? He must catch my alarmed face because his irritated expression softens immediately . ‘

64315	64347	64309	64309	I	363	’ I grumble . A shopping trip with Jesse is at the top of my avoid to do list . I ’ll walk out of the store looking like an Eskimo . ‘

64413	64555	64412	64412	I	363	’m completely in love with him and there is nothing I can do about it . Chapter 10 I peel my eyes open and find myself tucked closely into Jesse ’s chest . It ’s not quite daylight , which means it ’s very early , and Jesse is n’t awake , so it ’s definitely before five . My brain snaps awake immediately and I begin the meticulous task of freeing myself from his body without disturbing him . It ’s hard . He seems to hold onto me as tight in his sleep as he does when he ’s awake . I tentatively edge myself away from him , pausing and tensing every time he shifts or sighs in his sleep . My body is rigid as I creep my way to the edge of the bed . Once I ’m
64577	64709	64712	64712	he	846	’ worth of stubble . I want to jump straight back into bed with him , but I resist . What I have planned spurs me to leave him sleeping peacefully while I rootle quietly through my bag for my phone . It ’s five o’clock . Shit ! Okay , I ’ve got to be quick or he ’ll be waking soon to drag me around the streets of London on one of his torturous marathons . I creep about the bedroom like a naked burglar , retrieving my stash from the wooden trunk and easing out the contents . The carrier bag crumples , and I grit my teeth , freezing in place as he rolls onto his back on a moan . I remain like a statue until I ’m
64853	64914	64852	64852	I	363	’m not so worried about waking him now that I have at least one arm secured , although this will work better if he ca n’t lay any hands on me . I maneuver his arm cautiously above his head and fasten the other handcuff around the wrist of his damaged hand . It ’s looking much better , but I ’m
65071	65076	65077	65077	His	846	‘ Hey , baby . ’
65108	65111	65096	65096	his	846	‘ Hey , ’
65176	65181	65170	65170	He	846	‘ What the fuck ? ’
65202	65215	65195	65195	They	849	‘ Ava , why the fuck am I handcuffed to the bed ? ’

65247	65279	65237	65237	Jesse	431	’ He rattles his wrists again and takes another look at his restrained hands . I see realisation dawn on his handsome face as he turns his eyes back to me . ‘
65286	65291	65237	65237	Jesse	431	’ he says warily . ‘
65301	65307	65308	65308	I	363	’m sure you ’ve noticed . ’

65354	65376	65353	65353	I	363	’m really pushing my luck . He does n’t scorn me this time . Instead , he arches a nervous brow . ‘
65379	65387	65388	65388	I	363	’ Oh , I could cuddle him . ‘
65396	65412	65388	65388	I	363	’ I grind myself onto him teasingly and his chest expands , his jaw tensing . ‘

65424	65465	65388	65388	I	363	’ he groans . I place my hands on his chest and lower myself down to his face . He watches me as I descend , his eyes shimmering in anticipation and short pants of breath escaping his parted lips . ‘
65471	65507	65388	65388	I	363	’ I murmur , brushing my lips lightly over his . He lifts his head to try and make better contact , but I pull back . He scowls , dropping his head back down . ‘
65511	65549	65388	65388	I	363	’ he pants , and then moans in despair as I grind down again . I drop my mouth to his neck and nibble my way up to his ear , licking and lapping as I go . ‘
65555	65571	65388	65388	I	363	’ I whisper , and then bite his lobe gently . His cheeks puff out . ‘
65587	65601	65575	65575	Ava	0	’ I sit up on his chest and shake my head at him . ‘

65685	65693	65694	65694	I	363	‘ Remove the fucking cuffs , Ava ! ’

65853	65910	65852	65852	I	363	’m going to do . I plant my mouth on his and moan as he parts his lips and his tongue darts out , seeking mine . I pull back . He growls in frustration . Shifting off of his lap , I wickedly give his erection a long , slow lick straight up his shaft . ‘
65916	65921	65922	65922	Ava	0	’ he moans despairingly . ‘
65924	65965	65922	65922	Ava	0	’ I smile , sitting on my heels between his legs before collecting my weapon of mass destruction and holding it up in front of him . His head lifts , his eyes nearly falling out when he registers what I ’m

65990	66001	65981	65981	He	854	‘ You ca n’t do this to me . FUCK ! ’

I rest my lips on his lower stomach next to his scar and circle my tongue in a few slow , sweeping laps before crawling up his body and kicking off my knickers on my way . I look down at him , but he refuses to open his eyes , so I kiss the corner of his mouth . It works . His head turns instinctively and his lips part as he takes my lips . I press down on his groin , my wetness causing me to slide up and down with ease . ‘

67128	67218	67127	67127	I	363	’m not going to try and kid myself that I will get away with this again – he ’ll probably sleep with one eye open for the rest of his life , so perhaps I should take advantage of his vulnerable state and pump him for some more answers , like where that scar came from , how many women there have been and what the hell the police are doing at The Manor . Oh and the mystery woman and Sarah … He glares at me , and I ’m

68032	68035	68026	68026	he	865	‘ Ava ! ’
68178	68188	68189	68189	he	431	‘ Baby , come and free me , please . ’
68212	68250	68211	68211	I	363	’m not falling for it . As soon as I free him , he ’ll be on me like a lion before manhandling me into my running kit and dragging me around the streets of London . I ’m
68269	68393	68268	68268	I	363	’m not hanging about to be tortured by fourteen miles . Unfortunately , they come as a package deal . I sit myself in front of the floor length mirror to start drying my hair . I glance in the reflection every now and again and see him watching me , but he just scowls and throws his head back like a brooding schoolboy whenever I catch him . I smile to myself . I apply my make - up and smother myself in coco butter and when I put on the cream lace underwear set that Jesse bought me , I hear him whimper . I smile smugly to myself . I may as well . I do n’t know how long I ’m
68420	68451	68419	68419	I	363	’m ready . I walk over to my handcuffed man and lean down to drop a long , lingering kiss onto his parted lips . I do n’t know why I ’m
68493	68506	68507	68507	Ava	0	’m seriously in for it when he catches me . He jerks . ‘
68526	68533	68534	68534	His	363	’m going to fucking strangle you ! ’
68596	68601	68602	68602	he	363	‘ Ava , please ! ’
68641	68696	68640	68640	I	363	’m not freeing him completely . I undo his damaged hand and it falls limply to the bed . A pang of guilt assaults me as he gingerly flexes his fist to try and get some life back into it . I walk over to the chest and place the key back on top . ‘
68702	68709	68640	68640	I	363	’ he asks on a frown . ‘
68715	68716	68640	68640	I	363	’ ‘
68719	68728	68640	68640	I	363	’ The confusion in his face is clear . ‘
68738	68739	68743	68743	my	363	’ ‘
68755	68889	68747	68747	Ava	0	’ He ’s losing his patience again . I scan the room and spot his jacket on the floor where he obviously dumped it last night before he pounced on me in the bathroom . I find his phone in the inside pocket and place it on the bedside table , just out of reach . I do n’t want him calling for assistance before I make my escape . I fetch my bag and stride out of the bedroom , leaving him a massive mess of unexploded male . I am so going to cop it later , but at least I released one hand . It might be his damaged one , but he ’ll be able to sort himself out … if he does n’t grip too hard . Chapter 11 ‘
68894	68907	68908	68908	You	870	’ Patrick comes out of his office as I take my seat . ‘
68909	68916	68917	68917	He	870	’re bright and early this morning . ’
68942	68951	68917	68917	He	870	‘ What have you got to tell me ? ’
68952	68956	68957	68957	I	363	‘ Not much , ’
68963	68981	68957	68957	I	363	‘ I have a meeting with Mr Van Der Haus at lunchtime to go over my designs . ’
68982	68992	68993	68993	he	870	‘ Oh , Good . What about Mr Ward ? ’
68997	69005	68993	68993	he	870	‘ Have you heard from him yet ? ’
69024	69030	69016	69016	I	363	‘ Urhhh , no , I ’m
69042	69065	69034	69034	he	870	’ I turn my flaming face away from Patrick and load my email up , mentally praying he leaves it right there . ‘
69077	69098	69104	69104	him	870	’ he asks . I suspect he is frowning , but I ca n’t look at him to confirm that . ‘
69106	69110	69111	69111	I	363	’ I cough . ‘
69117	69128	69129	69129	He	870	’ Patrick rises from my desk on a long creak . ‘
69140	69144	69129	69129	He	870	’ he grumbles . ‘
69163	69284	69156	69156	She	872	’ he says as he makes his way back into his office . Sally is ill ? That ’s not like her . Oh ! It was her second date last night . Either it went very well and she ’s pulling a sicky to cavort in bed all day with Mr Mystery , or it went very badly and she ’s pulled a sicky to mope in bed all day with a box of tissues . I guiltily suspect it ’s the latter . Poor Sal . I sag in my chair on a long exhale , and then jump when I hear Angel seeping from my bag . Oh dear Lord . He ’s obviously freed himself . I ’m
69320	69327	69328	69328	I	363	‘ Good morning , Miss Quinn . ’
69332	69359	69328	69328	I	363	‘ Hi , Ava . Please , it ’s Ruth . I was just checking in . Have you managed to get the ball rolling yet ? ’
69360	69387	69315	69316	Miss Quinn	65	‘ Yes , I ’ve prepared a schedule of fees for my services , Ruth , and I ’ve drafted a few ideas to send over . ’
69388	69391	69392	69392	She	65	‘ Brilliant . ’
69397	69413	69392	69392	She	65	‘ I ’ll look forward to receiving them . Where do we go from there ? ’
69414	69439	69328	69328	I	363	‘ Well , if you are happy with my fee structure and draft ideas , then we can start putting together some firm designs . ’
69440	69444	69392	69392	She	65	‘ Great , I ’m
69448	69460	69328	69328	I	363	’ she exclaims . I smile . That much is obvious . ‘
69485	69486	69483	69483	Ruth	64	’ ‘
69491	69564	69489	69489	Ava	0	’ She hangs up , and I immediately set about scanning the designs into my computer . I love working with people who are as passionate about their home as I am . As ten o’clock hits , I ’ve been in the office for three hours and I ’ve got mountains of work done . I pick up my desk phone to chase Stella , my curtain maker , on Mrs Stiles ’
69608	69664	69607	69607	I	363	’m more than pleased when she tells me that she is just packaging them up , ready for me to collect . It ’s a week sooner than I quoted Mrs Stiles , so she will be delighted . I hang up and swing back around in my chair , nearly having a seizure when I ’m
69694	69733	69693	69693	I	363	’m instantly on high alert . Oh no ! He looks bloody delicious as well , in his grey suit and pale blue shirt , open at the collar with no tie . He ’s shaved his two days ’
69755	69764	69765	69765	he	81	‘ How lovely to see you , Ava . ’
69892	69894	69883	69883	I	363	‘ I ’m
69898	69936	69937	69937	I	363	’ I whisper the words quietly , my voice full of the regret I truly feel . My unreasonable desire to know his age has marked him . I really am going to be in for it . ‘
69942	69947	69937	69937	I	363	’ he answers coldly . ‘
69953	69977	69950	69951	Mr Ward	340	’ Patrick ’s cheerful voice invades my ears as he approaches my desk from his office . I release my hold of Jesse . ‘
69997	69998	69999	70000	Mr Peterson	137	’ ‘
70006	70022	69999	70000	Mr Peterson	137	’ Jesse gives him his full on melt worthy smile , usually reserved for women . ‘
70032	70049	70050	70050	I	363	’ Patrick asks . Jesse ’s eyes swing to mine briefly before returning to Patrick ’s . ‘
70055	70064	70050	70050	I	363	’ he replies , completely composed . Assets ? ‘
70073	70083	70050	70050	I	363	’ he asks . Patrick ’s face lights up . ‘
70091	70115	70050	70050	I	363	’ he confirms . I notice he does n’t advise Mr Ward that it is far too much for an initial upfront payment . ‘
70124	70142	70143	70143	He	363	’m eager to get things moving . My unexpected business trip has put us a bit behind . ’
70147	70152	70143	70143	He	363	‘ Of course , I ’m
70160	70188	70189	70189	I	363	’ Patrick places his hand on my shoulder affectionately , and Jesse ’s eyes fall straight onto it . Oh no . Do n’t trample my boss ! ‘
70190	70195	70196	70196	he	363	’m sure she will . ’
70249	70280	70241	70241	He	564	‘ I was going to ask Ava if she would like to join me for some brunch so we can go over a few things . You do n’t mind . ’
70297	70302	70293	70293	he	564	‘ Be my guest . ’
70315	70325	70326	70326	I	363	‘ Actually , I have an appointment at lunchtime . ’
70378	70432	70377	70377	I	363	’m not at all comfortable with that wily look all over his face . He ’s loving this , but then he catches a glimpse of my new diary and frowns , his jaw ticking slightly . Yes , I replaced it ! He better not even think about sabotaging my new one . ‘
70439	70448	70377	70377	I	363	’ Jesse points out , and I cringe . ‘
70457	70474	70377	70377	I	363	’ he adds on a husky , promising voice that also harbours a bit of threat . ‘
70479	70490	70377	70377	I	363	’ Patrick sings as he walks off to his office . ‘
70501	70590	70592	70592	we	880	’ I sit tapping my front tooth frantically with my nail while I try to think of a way out of this . There is none , and even if I had a valid reason , I would only be delaying the inevitable . I gaze up at the man who I love beyond measure , and I am literally trembling . He is playing it far too cool . It ’s a million miles away from the raging beast I left handcuffed to the bed this morning . ‘
70594	70688	70689	70690	Mr Ward	340	’ he asks , as he puts his hands in his pockets . I collect my phone from my desk and stuff it in my bag , along with my file for The Life Building . I ’ll need to head straight to The Royal Park for my meeting with Mikael after my meeting with Jesse . He holds the door open for me , and Tom comes barreling through before I have a chance to exit . His eyes go all wide and shocked when he clocks who ’s holding the door . ‘
70692	70726	70727	70727	Tom	70	’ he splutters , and then throws me a questioning look . It ’s ridiculous for him to be addressing Jesse so formally . He ’s been out drinking and dancing with him . ‘
70729	70737	70738	70738	I	363	’ Jesse nods , all business like . ‘
70739	70750	70738	70738	I	363	’m just going for a breakfast meeting with Mr Ward . ’
70770	70782	70783	70783	Tom	70	‘ Oh , I see . A business meeting , huh ? ’
70804	70823	70824	70824	He	70	‘ It was nice to see you , Mr Ward . I hope you enjoy your business meeting . ’
70862	70889	70861	70861	I	363	’m away from the office and the possibility of being ratted out , but nervous that I am now pretty much at Jesse ’s mercy . I ’m
70899	70938	70898	70898	we	883	’re in public he wo n’t have me pinned against the nearest free wall as soon as he can . We walk along , side by side , until we hit Piccadilly . I do n’t know where we ’re
70963	70998	70962	70962	I	363	’m getting more apprehensive by the second . I glance up at him and find his face is completely straight and he does n’t return my gaze , although I know he knows that I ’m
71003	71013	71014	71017	A mature business woman	884	‘ Excuse me , have you got the time ? ’
71066	71072	71073	71073	He	70	‘ It ’s ten fifteen . ’
71095	71244	71094	71094	I	363	’m spiked with immense possessiveness as she gushes a thank you . She is probably more Jesse ’s age than me , the brazen hussy . You ca n’t possibly tell me that she does n’t have a phone she could check . Everyone has a bloody phone these days , and why did n’t she ask that middle aged , overweight , balding , sweaty type in front of us ? I roll my eyes as I wait for Jesse to take the initiative and lead on . After he ’s spent a few moments blasting the woman with his knockout smile , ensuring she gets the full on experience , he carries on his way , me following . As I look back , I see the woman glancing over her shoulder . How desperate and unashamed can someone be ? I laugh to myself . I ’m
71255	71271	71254	71254	I	363	’m also completely unashamed . We cross the road and approach The Ritz , and I ’m
71289	71308	71288	71288	We	887	’re having brunch at The Ritz ? I say nothing as he leads me to the restaurant and we ’re
71331	71366	71320	71320	Jesse	431	‘ We ’ll have the Eggs Benedict twice , both with smoked salmon , both on granary , a cappuccino , extra shot , no chocolate and a strong black coffee . Thank you . ’
71375	71380	71381	71381	He	431	‘ Certainly , Sir , ’
71433	71440	71441	71441	he	431	‘ How is your day going ? ’
71513	71550	71512	71512	I	363	’m already having a pretty exclusive day . So far , I ’ve found out how old he is , used a vibrator , handcuffed him to the bed and left him there , and now I ’m
71568	71570	71563	71563	your	892	‘ I ’m
71574	71611	71613	71613	I	363	’ I answer honestly , because I have a feeling there are going to be a few more exclusives I can add to that list . His eyes lower so his super lashes fan his cheekbones . ‘
71622	71626	71613	71613	I	363	’ he asks . ‘
71631	71648	71653	71653	he	893	’ I whisper . My voice is full of all the nervousness I really feel . I ’m
71691	71732	71733	71733	He	893	‘ Well , my morning run was waylaid by a challenging little temptress , who handcuffed me to our bed and tortured me for information . She then abandoned me , leaving me helpless and in desperate need of her . ’
71757	71776	71751	71751	He	893	‘ I eventually got hold of my phone that she left just … out … of … reach … ’
71786	71828	71777	71777	He	893	‘ And then waited for a member of my staff to come and free me . I ran fourteen miles in my personal best time to expel some of the pent up frustrations that she presented me with , and now I ’m
71851	71938	71939	71939	You	897	’ I gasp at his crass words , spoken with no concern in the middle of the Ritz restaurant . Oh God , what must Big John think of me ? I hope he laughed . He seems to find Jesse ’s reactions and behaviour towards me quite amusing . The waiter places our coffees down and we both nod a thank you before he backs away again . I pick up my fancy – probably solid – silver spoon and start slowly stirring my coffee . ‘
71948	72002	72003	72003	Ava	0	’ I say quietly . Of all the things I could have said ? I glance up nervously and find him fighting a grin from his face . It makes me feel so much better . He wants to laugh , but he wants to be angry with me too . He sighs . ‘
72014	72022	72023	72023	You	897	’ I disintegrate on my yellow throne . ‘
72028	72038	72039	72039	I	363	’ I breathe on a long , relieved exhale . ‘
72050	72070	72039	72039	I	363	’ He reaches up and starts circling his temples , as if trying to rid himself of the memory . ‘
72073	72080	72039	72039	I	363	’ He pauses mid - rub . ‘
72089	72095	72039	72039	I	363	’ He says it like I ’m
72121	72136	72106	72106	he	363	‘ The thought of not being able to reach you actually made me panic . ’
72139	72146	72147	72147	I	363	‘ I was in the room ! ’
72179	72190	72174	72174	He	363	‘ You were n’t in the room when you left ! ’
72197	72205	72191	72191	I	363	‘ I left because you threatened me . ’
72220	72232	72233	72233	He	363	‘ Well , that ’s because you made me crazy mad . ’
72240	72248	72249	72249	he	363	‘ When did you get those handcuffs ? ’
72284	72304	72305	72305	I	363	‘ When I left work yesterday . You kind of pissed all over my plan with your retribution fuck . ’
72309	72320	72321	72321	he	363	‘ Watch your mouth . I pissed on your plan ? ’
72325	72363	72321	72321	he	363	‘ Ava , let me tell you , nowhere in my plan was it written that you would have me restrained and at your mercy . So , it is you who pissed all over my plan . ’
72434	72441	72442	72443	The waiter	889	‘ Is that all , Sir ? ’
72447	72453	72454	72455	The waiter	889	‘ Yes , thank you . ’
72485	72497	72498	72498	I	363	‘ You should know your temptress is extremely pleased with herself . ’
72523	72529	72530	72530	He	889	‘ I bet she is . ’
72535	72548	72549	72549	I	363	‘ Does she know how crazy in love with her I am ? ’
72556	72568	72555	72555	I	363	’m in The Ritz , eating the most incredible food and I ’m
72608	72614	72615	72615	I	363	‘ I think she does . ’
72627	72635	72636	72636	he	903	‘ She had better not just think . ’
72640	72644	72636	72636	he	903	‘ She knows . ’
72645	72648	72636	72636	he	903	‘ Good . ’
72649	72657	72658	72658	I	363	‘ What ’s the problem , anyway ? ’
72661	72667	72668	72668	His	903	‘ Thirty seven is nothing . ’
72679	72686	72674	72674	He	903	‘ I do n’t know . You ’re
72694	72703	72693	72693	I	363	’m in my mid to late - thirties . ’
72704	72707	72708	72708	I	363	‘ So ? ’
72723	72733	72713	72713	He	903	‘ It bothers you more than it does me . ’
72734	72737	72738	72738	He	903	‘ Maybe . ’
72813	72828	72812	72812	we	906	’re done , he clears our plates swiftly and Jesse asks for the bill . ‘
72839	72886	72887	72887	You	908	’ he asks before taking a sip of his coffee . I let out an exasperated breath . I ’d forgot about that . I know if I defy him on this , I ’ll be promptly ejected from Central Jesse Cloud Nine . I shrug . ‘
72894	72907	72887	72887	You	908	’ I can shoot to House of Fraser anytime on my travels . ‘
72923	72929	72915	72915	I	363	’ He smirks , and I ’m
72966	72970	72971	72971	I	363	‘ Friday lunch ? ’
72987	73000	72980	72980	His	363	‘ That ’s cutting it a bit fine , is n’t it ? ’
73001	73007	73008	73008	I	363	‘ I ’ll find something . ’
73019	73032	73008	73008	I	363	‘ Put me in your diary for Friday afternoon … all afternoon . ’
73033	73036	73037	73037	I	363	‘ What ? ’
73081	73096	73097	73097	His	363	‘ Make Mr Ward a Friday afternoon appointment . Say , one - ish . ’
73104	73123	73097	73097	His	363	‘ We ’ll go dress shopping and there will be no rush to get ready for the party . ’
73124	73137	73138	73138	I	363	‘ I ca n’t book out my whole afternoon for one appointment ! ’
73148	73156	73158	73158	him	910	‘ You can and you will . I ’m
73161	73175	73176	73176	You	911	’ He stands and makes his way to my side of the table . ‘
73183	73189	73182	73182	you	911	’re living with me . I ’m
73199	73243	73176	73176	You	911	’ Am I living with him ? I stand , taking the hand he has offered , and let him lead me out of the restaurant . No , he wo n’t pussy foot around . He ’ll just keep trampling him instead . ‘
73250	73256	73257	73257	He	564	’ I try to reason . ‘
73275	73290	73274	73274	I	363	’m slacking instead of working if I should have any business meetings with you . ’
73291	73314	73315	73315	he	564	‘ I could n’t give a fuck what he thinks . If he does n’t like it , then you ’ll retire . ’
73343	73345	73339	73339	He	564	‘ You ’re
73355	73422	73353	73353	you	564	’ I say warily . My man is like a Rhinoceros . The valet hands him his car keys and Jesse slips him a fifty . A fifty ? Just for parking and returning his car ? Granted , it is a very nice car , but still . He turns into me , grazes his palm down my cheek and circles his nose on mine . ‘

73440	73451	73353	73353	you	564	’ I submit , but judging by the last few minutes ’
73466	73472	73473	73473	He	363	‘ Thank you for breakfast . ’
73476	73485	73473	73473	He	363	‘ Anytime . Where are you going now ? ’
73486	73491	73503	73503	He	363	‘ The Royal Park . ’
73492	73502	73503	73503	He	363	‘ Near Lancaster Gate ? I ’ll take you . ’
73628	73637	73638	73638	I	363	‘ What am I going to tell Patrick ? ’
73652	73658	73659	73659	He	363	‘ What , about us ? ’
73674	73687	73688	73688	He	363	‘ No , about our business breakfast . What have we discussed ? ’
73691	73712	73688	73688	He	363	‘ Tell him we ’ve agreed fees and I want you at The Manor on Friday to finalise the designs . ’
73713	73721	73722	73722	I	363	‘ You make it sound so simple . ’
73746	73756	73757	73757	Jesse	431	‘ Baby , you make it sound so complicated . ’
73780	73788	73789	73789	He	363	‘ I ’ll see you at home . ’
73838	73843	73844	73844	I	363	‘ Six - ish . ’
73858	73861	73855	73855	He	363	‘ ish . ’
73899	73908	73909	73909	He	363	‘ I ca n’t retire at twenty six . ’
73934	73946	73930	73930	He	363	‘ I told you , I do n’t like sharing you . ’
73947	73952	73953	73953	I	363	‘ That ’s stupid . ’
73973	73982	73930	73930	He	363	‘ Do n’t call me stupid , Ava . ’
73983	73999	74000	74000	I	363	‘ I was n’t calling you stupid . I was calling your ambitious intention stupid . ’
74004	74006	74000	74000	I	363	‘ I ’m
74013	74054	74000	74000	I	363	’ I reach over and slide my hand across the back of his neck . Does he need re - assurance on this ? His lip disappears between his teeth as he stares at the steering wheel of the DBS . ‘
74073	74090	74066	74066	I	363	’ He turns tortured eyes onto me . It punches a massive hole in my stomach . ‘
74094	74109	74110	74112	No specific people	923	’ I ask , alarm clear in my tone . He shakes his head . ‘
74143	74161	74133	74133	I	363	’ His hands slide over the steering wheel , his knuckles turning white from his harsh grip . ‘
74173	74179	74172	74172	I	363	’m feeling a bit violent . ’
74218	74405	74217	74217	I	363	’m also fully aware that what he actually means is he ’ll eliminate any male threat to him , not me . I undo my belt and crawl across the car to straddle his lap , with complete disregard for the valet , who is still dribbling all over the DBS . I pull his face up to mine , cupping his cheeks and lowering my lips to his . He moans and slides his hands around to clench my bum and pull me in towards his hips . I want him to take me back to Lusso right now , but I ca n’t brush Mikael off . Our tongues slowly sweep together , rolling , pulling back and plunging again , time and time again . I ache with need for this man – painful , constant aching , and I know he feels exactly the same about me . I pull back and find his eyes clenched shut . I ’ve seen that look before , and the last time I saw it , it was because he had something to tell me . ‘
74410	74436	74217	74217	I	363	’ I ask nervously . His eyes fly open quickly , like he ’s suddenly realised that he was pulling a complete give away face . ‘
74441	74452	74217	74217	I	363	’ He brushes away a loose tendril of my hair . ‘
74457	74478	74217	74217	I	363	’ I stiffen in his lap . He ’s said that before too , and everything really was n’t right . ‘
74488	74496	74497	74497	You	0	’ I state it as a fact . ‘
74498	74504	74505	74505	His	0	’re right , I do . ’
74528	74536	74537	74537	I	363	‘ I crazy love you , baby . ’
74541	74552	74553	74553	I	363	‘ That ’s not what you want to tell me . ’
74581	74609	74610	74610	He	0	‘ Yes , it is . And I ’ll keep telling you until you get fed up of hearing it . It ’s a novelty to me . ’
74613	74619	74610	74610	He	0	‘ I like saying it . ’
74620	74652	74653	74653	He	0	‘ I wo n’t get fed up of hearing it , and do n’t be saying it to anyone else . I do n’t care how much you like saying it . ’
74663	74670	74671	74671	I	363	‘ Would that make you jealous ? ’
74674	74694	74695	74695	I	363	‘ Mr Ward , let ’s not talk about jealously when you ’ve just vowed to eliminate any threat . ’
74699	74706	74707	74707	He	0	‘ Okay , let ’s not . ’
74726	74734	74735	74735	he	0	‘ Let ’s get a room instead . ’
74772	74774	74763	74763	I	363	‘ I ’m

74808	74815	74797	74797	I	363	’ He smiles a satisfied smile . ‘

74853	74888	74851	74851	you	928	’ He makes a grab for me , but I bat his hands away quickly , jumping out of the car before he completely swallows me up . I pop my head back in . ‘
74906	74907	74908	74908	You	928	’ ‘
74912	74923	74908	74908	You	928	’ he asks , a triumphant look on his face . ‘

75062	75130	75131	75131	Ava	0	’m shown to the same snug where Mikael and I last met , and Mikael is already waiting for me . He has the mood boards laid out on the table and is studying them . He looks more casual today , his suit jacket removed , his tie loose , but his pale blonde hair still perfectly styled . He looks up when I walk in . ‘
75140	75151	75131	75131	Ava	0	’ His lightly accented voice is as smooth as ever . ‘
75162	75184	75157	75157	You	0	’ I nod at the boards as I set my bag down on one of the large , green leather couches . ‘

75218	75239	75240	75240	I	363	’ I smile brightly while he shakes my hand gently . He releases me and turns back towards the table . ‘
75241	75249	75250	75250	He	388	’m veering towards this one , though . ’
75260	75264	75259	75259	I	363	’m favouring myself . ‘
75272	75277	75278	75278	I	363	’ I say cheerily . ‘

75291	75300	75305	75305	Ava	0	’ he agrees , smiling warmly at me . ‘

75329	75348	75349	75349	I	363	’ He signals to the waiter at the doorway before lowering himself onto the sofa next to me . ‘
75371	75452	75366	75366	I	363	’ Oh . That would be his divorce then . I ca n’t imagine things would go smoothly when you are as rich as Mikael . His wife is probably trying to take him for every penny . Why else would it not be going smoothly ? I do n’t say anything , though . I suspect Ingrid should n’t have divulged as much as she did . I do n’t want to get her sacked . I liked her . ‘
75461	75473	75476	75476	we	935	’ I smile and return my eyes to the mood boards . ‘
75477	75484	75485	75485	I	363	’re swinging towards this one then ? ’
75500	75533	75496	75496	He	363	‘ Yes , I like the simplicity and warmness . You are very clever . One would think it would come across insipid and cold , but it does n’t at all . ’
75534	75547	75548	75548	He	363	‘ Thank you , It ’s all about the fabrics and tones . ’
75556	75564	75548	75548	He	363	‘ Yes , I guess it is . ’
75632	75642	75619	75619	He	363	‘ It will all be sustainable material , yes ? ’
75662	75666	75667	75667	I	363	‘ Of course , ’
75696	75719	75685	75685	I	363	‘ It ’s all sustainable , as per you specification . I understand the forestry commission in Scandinavia is a serious business . ’
75720	75724	75725	75725	he	363	‘ It is , ’
75728	75748	75725	75725	he	363	‘ We all have to do our bit for the environment . We got some bad press after Lusso . ’
75775	75779	75780	75780	I	363	‘ We do , ’
75795	75803	75783	75783	He	363	‘ Excuse me while I use the ladies ’
75805	75830	75783	75783	He	363	’ I collect my bag and leave him . I spend five minutes in the toilets refreshing my face and using the facilities . I ’m
75841	75869	75840	75840	I	363	’m eager to get back to the office to start working on the master design . I ruffle my hair , pinch my cheeks and exit the ladies ’
75969	76060	76061	76061	Mikael	388	’m at a loss . I stand and watch them chat , all business like , while I try to figure out how to handle this . As per my usual reaction to Jesse ’s wayward ways , I want to scream at him , but with Mikael here , that is out of the question . As if he has sensed my presence – he always does – Jesse slowly turns to face me . I flash him a you’re - pushing - it look and slowly approach them . ‘
76063	76150	76151	76151	Ava	0	’ I say , muscling my way between them at the table . I feel Jesse tense from head to toe at my informal acknowledgment to my client . He can go and take a leap off the nearest cliff ! The man deserves everything he gets . And he wants me to move in ? He can forget it , and there will be no sense fucking to change my mind either . Mikael smiles at me . I do n’t miss the arched eyebrow . ‘
76186	76187	76178	76178	He	340	’ ‘
76192	76211	76178	76178	He	340	’ I say without even acknowledging Jesse , turning my back on him to face my client instead . ‘
76220	76230	76178	76178	He	340	’ I feel ice cold air emanate from Jesse . ‘
76238	76242	76178	76178	He	340	’ Mikael says . ‘
76268	76294	76262	76262	I	363	’ His eyebrows rise suggestively and while I know I should n’t be encouraging this sort of behaviour , I just ca n’t help myself . ‘
76306	76341	76342	76342	I	363	’ I smile , but then feel Jesse ’s warm , minty breath on the back of my neck . He ’s standing pretty damn close for someone who supposedly does n’t know me . ‘
76343	76348	76349	76349	Jesse	431	’m sorry to interrupt , ’
76393	76401	76403	76403	you	945	‘ Baby , have you forgotten that I ’m
76406	76449	76403	76403	you	945	’ Oh fucking hell ! He really does n’t have any regard or shame . He ’s going to get me sacked . Mikael is going to be calling Patrick to complain , then Patrick is going find out about Jesse and I ’m
76492	76502	76503	76503	Mikael	388	‘ I did n’t realise you knew each other . ’
76574	76591	76592	76592	he	431	‘ I was in the area and I knew the love of my life was here , ’
76595	76608	76592	76592	he	431	‘ I thought I would slip in and get my fix . I ’m
76619	76632	76592	76592	he	431	’ He bends down and brushes his lips over my ear . I ’m
76636	76641	76642	76642	he	431	‘ I missed you . ’
76710	76764	76765	76765	I	363	’m facing Mikael and pulls my back to his chest , wrapping his arm around the tops of my shoulders and kissing my temple . This is so unprofessional . I want to die on the spot . I look up at Mikael and find him observing Jesse ’s little trampling session thoughtfully . ‘
76766	76790	76791	76791	Mikael	388	’m sorry , when you mentioned you were here to meet your girlfriend , I did n’t realise you were referring to Ava . ’
76795	76803	76791	76791	Mikael	388	‘ Yes , is n’t she beautiful ? ’
76818	76823	76824	76824	he	388	‘ And all mine . ’
76910	76931	76932	76932	He	388	‘ Mr Ward , if I had an Ava , I ’ve no doubt I would do exactly the same . ’
76947	76955	76956	76956	I	363	‘ Perhaps Monday would be more suitable ? ’
76961	76970	76956	76956	I	363	‘ Of course , Monday will be fine . ’
77015	77031	77007	77007	Mikael	388	‘ I ’ll call you to arrange a time once I ’ve checked my diary . ’
77038	77051	77037	77037	I	363	’m ending an important business meeting with a very important client and I ’m
77063	77066	77067	77067	I	363	’m mortified . ‘
77073	77147	77067	77067	I	363	’ I say enthusiastically , earning myself a sharp little nudge in my back . Is he winding me up ? Mikael exits the snug , and I notice him glancing over his shoulder as he leaves . I just about capture the thoughtful look on his pale face , and I ca n’t help but think that Jesse has just set a challenge for him . I could collapse with exasperation . I ’m
77172	77182	77183	77183	I	363	‘ I ca n’t believe you just did that , ’
77194	77204	77205	77205	I	363	‘ You ’ve just trampled my most important client . ’
77206	77230	77205	77205	I	363	’m swung around in his arms to find his face level with mine as he bends to accommodate the height difference between us . ‘
77238	77252	77253	77253	You	951	’ he asks on a heavy furrowed brow . I roll my eyes . ‘
77254	77265	77253	77253	You	951	’re my lover , who happens to be a client . ’
77266	77274	77253	77253	You	951	‘ I am more than your lover ! ’
77341	77350	77335	77335	I	363	‘ I need to get back to work . ’
77392	77399	77400	77400	he	952	‘ You did that on purpose . ’
77443	77446	77447	77447	I	363	‘ Why ? ’
77463	77469	77470	77470	he	952	‘ Because I love you . ’
77474	77481	77470	77470	he	952	‘ That ’s not a reason . ’
77486	77511	77485	77485	I	363	’m completely defeated . I am . His head snaps up in shock , and he pins me in place with his appalled glare . ‘
77526	77565	77520	77520	he	952	’ Okay , now he ’s just making up excuses to justify his unreasonable behaviour . If he loves me , then he should support me in my work , not try to sabotage it . I know I ’m
77605	77619	77620	77620	I	363	‘ You ca n’t hijack every meeting I have with a male client . ’
77637	77655	77656	77656	he	952	‘ I wo n’t , just him . And any other man who may be a threat . ’
77695	77701	77687	77687	Jesse	431	‘ I have to go . ’
77718	77724	77725	77725	he	952	‘ I ’ll take you , ’
77733	77738	77739	77739	He	952	‘ Collect your things . ’
77753	77760	77761	77761	he	952	‘ These are really very good . ’
77866	77934	77865	77865	I	363	’m not spotted by Patrick getting out of Mr Ward ’s car nearly four hours after I went for a breakfast meeting with him . I have no doubt that my days are numbered with regards to Patrick ’s enlightenment on mine and Jesse ’s involvement . I would like to delay it for as long as possible , though . I need to think about how I ’m
78004	78013	78014	78014	Patrick	564	‘ You ’ve been a while , flower . ’
78024	78040	78041	78041	I	363	‘ Mikael and I had a lot to go through . It ’s looking good . ’
78060	78068	78056	78056	He	564	‘ Ah ! He is still happy ? ’
78069	78072	78073	78073	I	363	‘ Very . ’
78088	78091	78092	78092	he	564	‘ Wonderful ! ’
78149	78169	78137	78137	They	961	‘ I do n’t know why he does n’t just buy you the shop . Sign here , please . ’
78184	78187	78179	78179	I	363	‘ Thanks . ’
78200	78319	78320	78320	Ava	0	’m sorry - ish Jx I fall back in my chair . What he means is … he ’s sorry because he knows that he has upset me , but he is not at all sorry for trampling Mikael or my day . Maybe I should stay at Kate ’s tonight . I could do with some time , a big bottle of wine , my own thoughts and no distractions . The office door swings open and I look up to see Ruth Quinn beaming at me . Why is she here ? I only spoke to her this morning . Her blonde hair is shining and bouncing as she struts to my desk , waving excitedly . ‘
78322	78326	78327	78327	Ruth	64	’ she sings . ‘
78329	78343	78327	78327	Ruth	64	’ I frown , but she does n’t seem to notice my confusion . ‘
78358	78375	78353	78353	I	363	’ She places her neat , slender body on a chair in front of my desk . ‘
78378	78388	78353	78353	I	363	’ I say , looking at her to continue . ‘
78391	78427	78353	78353	I	363	’ she smiles , but does n’t elaborate . I glance at the clock . It ’s not even three o’clock . I ’ve got another three hours to get her designs over by email . ‘
78440	78444	78353	78353	I	363	’ I ask . ‘
78452	78460	78461	78461	I	363	’m sure I ’ll love the designs . ’
78462	78479	78461	78461	I	363	’m not sure what to say . She ’s dropped by for nothing ? No reason ? ‘
78486	78498	78501	78501	I	363	’ Her smile fades a little . I shake myself up . ‘
78502	78505	78506	78506	I	363	’m fine . ’
78513	78535	78536	78536	I	363	’m not fine , but I want to mood over it in peace , not make pointless conversation with a client . ‘
78556	78583	78543	78543	I	363	’ I know I ’ve already told her this on the telephone , but what else can I say . Should I offer her a coffee ? ‘
78586	78600	78543	78543	I	363	’ She strokes her hair , and then flicks it over her shoulder . ‘
78609	78626	78627	78627	I	363	’ Now I really am frowning . She ’s not a clinger on , is she ? ‘
78628	78632	78633	78633	I	363	’m not sure . ’
78634	78644	78633	78633	I	363	’m really not . I do n’t know what I ’m
78649	78663	78664	78664	We	965	’m going , not in any element of my life at the moment . ‘
78669	78700	78664	78664	We	965	’ I inwardly groan . She wants to be friends . Never mix business with pleasure – my new rule applies to female clients too . What should I say ? ‘
78703	78734	78664	78664	We	965	’ The word slips past my lips and stuns me . I do n’t want to have drinks with Ruth . I want to crawl into my bed and sulk . ‘
78739	78742	78743	78743	she	967	’re okay ? ’
78746	78751	78752	78752	I	363	‘ Yes , fine . ’
78758	78761	78757	78757	I	363	’m struggling . ‘
78765	78774	78757	78757	I	363	’ Her fair , precisely plucked eyebrow rises . ‘
78777	78791	78792	78792	Ava	0	’ I shake my head . Oh God , she ’s getting personal . ‘
78805	78809	78794	78794	I	363	’ She laughs . ‘
78816	78817	78794	78794	I	363	’ ‘
78827	78883	78884	78884	They	970	’ I ca n’t believe I just said that . No man ? There most certainly is a man , and he most certainly is causing me turmoil . But I need Kate for this line of conversation , not a client . Wine and Kate . She gives me a knowing smile and stands . ‘
78885	78891	78892	78892	I	363	’re not worth the trouble . ’
78901	78910	78911	78911	I	363	’m pleased that she appears to be leaving . ‘
78921	78923	78919	78919	Ruth	64	’ I ’m
78927	78940	78941	78941	She	968	‘ Ca n’t wait ! We ’ll talk soon … about drinks . ’
78957	79008	78956	78956	I	363	’m in . I immediately email her . I do n’t want her returning and offering more drinks . My head ’s going to explode . I need Kate , and I need wine . I do n’t go to Kate ’s , though . I leave the office and I ’m
79047	79052	79043	79045	this mystery woman	66	‘ Evening , Ava . ’
79053	79066	79078	79078	He	972	‘ Hello , Clive . Can I speak to security , please ? ’
79067	79077	79078	79078	He	972	‘ They are all off site at the moment . ’
79103	79106	79107	79107	I	363	‘ Right . ’
79275	79404	79274	79274	I	363	’m suddenly thinking that leaving before he got free was a decision well made . I look across the room to the bed and see the handcuffs still dangling from the headboard , mental images of Jesse flying into a rage instantly starting to assault my brain . This man has issues – big , unreasonable , bloody issues … with control … with me . I kneel and collect up all of the pieces , taking them to the bathroom and depositing them in the bin before I start running a bath . Picking up the calla lilies that are in desperate need of some water , I make my way back downstairs . I get halfway down and hear the front door shut quietly , and I ’m
79517	79523	79524	79524	You	981	’m never handcuffing him again . ‘
79525	79541	79524	79524	You	981	’re not laying a finger on me until you tell me who that woman was . ’
79566	79572	79573	79573	I	363	’m not backing down here . ‘
79578	79585	79573	79573	I	363	’ His face is completely expressionless . ‘
79601	79620	79621	79623	My beautiful girl	2662	’ He almost smiles , but he must know because Clive would most certainly have mentioned me prying . ‘
79627	79628	79629	79630	My God	2662	’ ‘
79634	79639	79640	79640	Ava	0	’ I retort quietly . ‘
79660	79661	79654	79654	I	363	’ ‘
79671	79672	79673	79673	I	363	’ ‘
79678	79680	79673	79673	I	363	’ I ’m
79693	79700	79685	79685	I	363	‘ So why was she here ? ’
79701	79709	79710	79710	He	984	‘ Because she heard I was missing . ’
79715	79724	79725	79725	He	984	‘ That ’s it . She was worried ? ’
79728	79743	79725	79725	He	984	‘ Yes . That ’s it . Now I get you all over me . ’
79759	79770	79771	79771	He	984	‘ Why did n’t you just tell me this before ? ’
79774	79787	79788	79788	He	984	‘ Because it was no big deal until you made it one . ’
79821	79833	79834	79834	He	984	‘ You made it a big deal by evading my questions . ’
79984	80026	80030	80030	he	984	’m confronted with gentle , soft Jesse . I do n’t mind . I need soft and loving right now . My bra is removed and my ankles tapped in the usual fashion so he can remove my knickers . Once we ’re
80141	80147	80148	80148	he	984	‘ I ’ve missed you . ’
80215	80227	80204	80204	I	363	‘ I missed you too . Thank you for the flowers . ’
80228	80230	80204	80204	I	363	‘ You ’re
80233	80261	80262	80262	I	363	’ He kisses up to my lips and scatters light pecks all over me before brushing my hair from my face . He gazes down at me . ‘
80279	80280	80262	80262	I	363	’ ‘
80301	80330	80332	80332	his	363	’ His lips twitch at the corners and his eyes regain a bit of twinkle . He drops a kiss on my lips and rolls us over so I ’m
80401	80407	80408	80408	he	363	‘ I fucking love you . ’
80411	80417	80408	80408	he	363	‘ I know you do . ’
80430	80437	80418	80418	I	363	‘ I love you , too . ’
80438	80443	80448	80448	he	363	‘ Even after today ? ’
80461	80471	80472	80472	He	363	‘ You mean after you stalked me all day ? ’
80496	80503	80504	80504	he	363	‘ I was worried about you . ’
80516	80520	80521	80521	he	363	‘ I was . ’
80543	80562	80563	80563	He	363	‘ You were over - the - top and stupidly possessive . My challenging man needs to relax . ’
80566	80568	80563	80563	He	363	‘ I ’m
80572	80573	80574	80574	You	993	’ ‘
80575	80581	80582	80582	His	363	’re challenging and in denial . ’
80586	80594	80582	80582	His	363	‘ What am I in denial about ? ’
80595	80612	80613	80613	I	363	‘ Being challenging and unreasonable . Your performance today was way off the scales of unreasonableness . ’
80698	80713	80714	80714	He	363	’m not telling him anything . He looks at me with a little scowl . ‘
80732	80775	80714	80714	He	363	’ I laugh lightly . Like he did n’t make a good enough job of that already ? He does n’t need to know that Mikael has already made his move . I will be keeping that snippet of information to myself . ‘
80791	80795	80714	80714	He	363	’ I grumble . ‘
80800	80818	80819	80819	You	996	’ he mutters , and I roll my eyes , making a dramatic display of my exasperation . ‘
80824	80828	80819	80819	You	996	’ I say . ‘
80834	80844	80819	80819	You	996	’ I jump up and run into the bathroom . ‘
80852	80859	80819	80819	You	996	’ he calls to my back . ‘
80867	81022	81024	81024	you	997	’ I flip the tap off . He ’s had me here all week . He calls me , texts me , sends me flowers and gets John to drive me to work . It ’s all some form of contact or control . I bet he could n’t go a whole day without some form of trample or intrusion on my working day . Would I want him to not interfere ? I like the flowers and the messages ; it ’s the tramples I have an issue with . Would he be tempted to have a drink to try and get through the day ? Could I risk it ? My relaxed brain begins to ache … again . I make my way back into the bedroom , finding him still sprawled on the floor . He is just too delicious . I walk over and settle myself back on his hips . ‘
81027	81031	81024	81024	you	997	’ he asks . ‘
81053	81086	81024	81024	you	997	’ He reaches up and pinches my nipple , and I jerk on top of him , catching a full on rub from his erection . He gives me his roguish grin . ‘
81097	81141	81024	81024	you	997	’ I ask . There will be times in the future when he might actually be on a real business trip . Or , perhaps , I will . His grin disappears instantly and is replaced with a glare pointed straight at me . ‘
81151	81152	81024	81024	you	997	’ ‘
81175	81250	81170	81170	I	363	’ A fleeting look of panic flies across his face and his bottom lip disappears between his teeth . He ’s considering what I ’ve suggested , and it ’s now I realise that he absolutely meant it when he said he ’ll have me wherever and whenever he wants . Now that really is unreasonable . I ’ve seen the result of a few missed calls on my part – he was frantic . ‘
81260	81280	81281	81281	I	363	’ There , I ’ve said it . He laughs , and I frown . What ’s so funny ? ‘
81295	81318	81291	81291	I	363	’ he says surely . He sits up and rests his hands on my hips . I jerk , and he smiles . ‘
81331	81332	81291	81291	I	363	’ ‘
81338	81401	81291	81291	I	363	’ I mumble sarcastically as I ease myself up and put my hand out to him . He looks at me with narrowed eyes and reaches up to take my hand , yanking me forward and spinning me onto my back . He rests his big body all over me and drops his lips to mine in a long , lingering kiss . ‘
81418	81428	81416	81416	lady	59	’ Ha ! Easy for him to say . I ’m
81435	81446	81447	81447	I	363	‘ So , tomorrow I ’ll be undisturbed all day ? ’
81489	81492	81483	81483	he	999	‘ Lunch ? ’
81503	81505	81507	81507	Kate	431	‘ I ’m
81511	81520	81507	81507	Kate	431	’ I dismiss his request . He pouts . ‘
81526	81548	81523	81523	I	363	’ No , he ca n’t come because I need time with Kate to talk about him and his challenging ways . ‘
81551	81556	81557	81557	I	363	’ I state firmly . ‘
81560	81564	81565	81565	he	999	’re being unreasonable . ’
81597	81600	81601	81601	I	363	‘ Stop ! ’
81604	81607	81601	81601	I	363	‘ No ! ’
81608	81611	81590	81590	his	999	‘ Please ! ’
81631	81634	81635	81635	he	999	‘ Lunch ? ’
81645	81649	81635	81635	he	999	‘ Absolutely not ! ’
81663	81670	81662	81662	I	363	’m not submitting . No way ! ‘
81679	81697	81698	81698	Jesse	431	’ He releases my hip and I relax , trying to get my erratic breathing under control . ‘
81712	81718	81698	81698	Jesse	431	’ I try to reason . ‘
81728	81747	81698	81698	Jesse	431	’ He ’s deadly serious . My eyes widen in disgust . Never ! I love my job . ‘
81756	81832	81698	81698	Jesse	431	’ I lose my trail as he plunges deep into me . Oh God , here comes the sense fuck , but what is he trying to get me to submit to ? Lunch or retiring ? At twenty six ? How ridiculous ! He wastes no time breaking me in . He powers into me like a madman . My legs fall open and he pins my wrists on either side of my head . ‘
81835	81864	81698	81698	Jesse	431	’ he asks as he thrusts hard . My brain has just turned to mush , but it still registers that this is a lunch sense fuck . I ’m
81899	81902	81890	81891	Mr Challenging	106	‘ No ! ’
81931	81939	81940	81940	I	363	‘ You are so receptive to me . ’
81951	81957	81958	81958	Jesse	431	’m all over the place . ‘
81962	81974	81975	81975	Baby	93	’ He hits me hard with his hips and grinds firmly . ‘
81984	81994	81975	81975	Baby	93	’ I shake my head , holding my breath . ‘
82000	82001	81996	81996	I	363	’ ‘
82004	82029	81996	81996	I	363	’ I shout on a rushed exhale . The crest of a booming orgasm descends on me and his grip tightens around my wrists . ‘
82033	82066	81996	81996	I	363	’ he insists harshly , and I know he ’s on his way to explosion too . What if I do n’t say yes ? What if I hold out on him ? ‘
82069	82071	81996	81996	I	363	’ I ’m
82104	82113	82092	82092	He	819	‘ Ava , give me what I want . ’
82114	82117	82157	82157	baby	0	‘ Jesse ! ’
82118	82120	82157	82157	baby	0	‘ You ’re
82125	82126	82157	82157	baby	0	’ ‘
82129	82152	82157	82157	baby	0	’ I cry . All of the pent up stress of the day is going to come rushing out at any moment . ‘
82166	82186	82157	82157	baby	0	’ He hits me with another powerful , thundering of his hips . My mind goes blank , and I ’m
82208	82214	82215	82215	I	363	‘ What are you doing ? ’
82255	82259	82260	82260	I	363	‘ You bastard ! ’
82263	82274	82275	82275	he	819	‘ Watch your fucking mouth ! Say yes , Ava . ’
82298	82301	82302	82302	I	363	‘ No . ’
82328	82331	82332	82332	I	363	‘ Ohhh . ’
82335	82338	82332	82332	I	363	‘ Faster . ’
82339	82346	82347	82347	He	819	‘ Say the word , Ava . ’
82353	82365	82347	82347	He	819	‘ Say it , and you ’ll get what you want . ’
82366	82373	82374	82374	I	363	‘ You do n’t play fair . ’
82377	82384	82374	82374	I	363	‘ You want me to stop ? ’
82385	82388	82389	82389	I	363	‘ No ! ’
82409	82422	82401	82401	He	819	‘ I ’ll ask you one more time , baby . Lunch ? ’
82443	82447	82451	82451	he	819	‘ Fuck me . ’
82462	82467	82468	82468	He	819	‘ Watch your mouth . ’
82472	82478	82468	82468	He	819	‘ Was that a yes ? ’
82479	82482	82483	82483	I	363	‘ YES ! ’
82486	82490	82491	82491	he	819	‘ Good girl . ’
82548	82551	82552	82552	I	363	‘ Jesse ! ’
82553	82638	82639	82639	My	363	’m gripped from every direction by stabbing shots of pleasure flying through my nervous system , exploding at my core . I scream . His drives become more urgent and his breathing loud and erratic as he smashes against me on carnal shouts and releases everything he has , my core muscles clenching greedily onto him , my limp , exhausted body completely helpless to his unforgiving blows . He collapses on top of me in a sweaty heap and rocks gently against me . ‘
82645	82749	82750	82750	Your	363	’ he pants in my ear . I lie under his hard , warm body , trying to gather my senses and breath , and wonder if it will always be like this . He gets the results he wants , so yes , it probably will be . I ’ve got to learn to deal with this . I ’ve got to train myself to repel him . I laugh at such a pointless exercise . I do n’t want to repel him . He pushes himself up on his hands and it ’s only now I notice he does n’t wince . ‘
82753	82776	82750	82750	Your	363	’ I cry . He lifts it up and I can still see slight bruising , but the swelling has subsided massively . ‘
82794	82797	82798	82798	Sarah	59	’ What ? ‘
82800	82831	82832	82832	She	59	’ I blurt without thinking about what tone I should use . It comes out accusingly . He frowns at me , and I hate myself for sounding so shocked . ‘
82839	82967	82832	82832	She	59	’ he says coolly , but this only heightens my concern . She would have seen his marked wrists . It would n’t take much intelligence to figure out where they had come from . Another woman looking after him does n’t sit well , and the fact that it ’s pouty lips really has my jealous streak racing to the surface . She has made it obvious that she does n’t like me , at the same time making it perfectly obvious that she really likes Jesse . And the women of The Manor will probably treat me with the same brusqueness and … my head hurts . I suddenly feel extremely uncomfortable with my possessiveness . Good God , I ridicule Jesse for this . I ’m
83045	83063	83044	83044	I	363	’m really not comfortable with these feelings . I ’ve never been jealous in my life . I ’m
83091	83103	83085	83085	I	363	‘ Has someone got a touch of the green eyed monster ? ’
83122	83125	83126	83126	I	363	‘ No . ’
83157	83180	83181	83181	Ava	0	’m cradled between his legs . He drapes his arms over my shoulders and pulls me back to rest on his chest . ‘
83191	83199	83181	83181	Ava	0	’ he says softly in my ear . ‘
83206	83237	83181	83181	Ava	0	’ He picks up the natural sponge from the edge of the bath , dips it to soak up some water , and then starts running it across my breasts . ‘
83247	83257	83181	83181	Ava	0	’ I feel his chest lift on a sigh . ‘
83265	83266	83181	83181	Ava	0	’ ‘

83381	83385	83377	83377	he	1008	‘ Tell me . ’
83418	83423	83424	83424	he	1008	‘ I ’ve dabbled . ’
83431	83448	83430	83430	I	363	’m not sure I like the sound of dabbling , especially in this area of enquiry . ‘
83454	83455	83450	83450	you	1010	’ ‘
83458	83464	83450	83450	you	1010	’ He ’s truly defensive . ‘
83473	83509	83450	83450	you	1010	’ I do n’t think I want to know this . Why am I asking these questions ? His sponge strokes pause again . Please do n’t tell me he has to think about this . ‘
83516	83525	83450	83450	you	1010	’ He continues caressing me with the sponge . ‘
83533	83563	83564	83564	Ava	0	’ I need to shut up . I really do n’t want to know this stuff , but damn , I ca n’t stop the stupid questions flying out . ‘
83570	83575	83564	83564	Ava	0	’ he ’s annoyed . ‘
83578	83602	83564	83564	Ava	0	’ I retort quickly . No , actually , it does n’t , but his short , huffy answer is prickling my curiosity . ‘
83608	83618	83564	83564	Ava	0	’ He ’s doing his best to avoid this . ‘
83626	83627	83564	83564	Ava	0	’ ‘
83643	83656	83564	83564	Ava	0	’ That question has me prickling further . What has he done ? ‘
83659	83665	83564	83564	Ava	0	’ I say , but I ’m
83677	83706	83707	83707	His	363	‘ So , can we drop it ? It ’s in my past with a whole heap of other stuff , and I would rather leave it there . ’
83716	83725	83726	83726	He	363	‘ There is only you . End of . ’
83734	83742	83743	83743	I	363	‘ When are we moving you in ? ’
83776	83778	83764	83764	he	363	‘ I ’m
83781	83786	83787	83787	I	363	’ I remind him . ‘
83792	83798	83787	83787	I	363	’ he pinches my nipple . ‘
83804	83843	83787	83787	I	363	’ I roll my eyes . I need to retrieve the rest of my stuff from Matt , and I have a ridiculous amount of clothes at Kate ’s , even after my brutal clear out , but I ’m

After a not so well - balanced Chinese takeaway , I curl up on the sofa under Jesse ’s arm . He strokes my hair as he watches some MotoGP programme . It ’s obviously a passion , judging by the intensity of his concentration on the television . I snuggle and wonder what tomorrow will bring . He ’s already negotiated lunch with one of his mind boggling sense fucks . I could refuse , but then I would only be setting myself up for a reminder fuck . Would that be so bad ? I start to doze off and my semi - conscious mind homes in on his unknown activities at The Manor . Is it really compulsory for me to know every little detail ? I believe him when he says I ’m

I try to position myself in his line of sight , but he does n’t acknowledge me . He just carries on with the rocking and mumbling , staring straight through me . He ’s asleep . I pull his legs down away from his body and climb onto his lap , wrapping my arms around his sodden back , holding him as tight as I can . I do n’t know if he is aware , but his arms come up and grip me , and his face buries deep into my neck . We sit like this forever . I whisper in his ear , hoping he will recognise me and snap out of his night terror . Is that what this is ? I have no idea . He is definitely not awake , I know that much . ‘

85710	85829	85830	85830	I	363	’ I say nervously . He does n’t answer . I lift my head to look at him and see he ’s fast asleep , looking peaceful . What was that all about ? I lay on him for hours , my mind racing with reasons for him to be sorry . Bloody Hell , maybe I am reading too much into this . There ’s plenty for him to be sorry for . Lying to me , deceiving me , drink , his unreasonableness , his possessive streak , his neurotic behaviour , trampling my meeting today , his … I doze off , running through all of the reasons why Jesse could be sorry .

87490	87748	87489	87489	I	363	’m touched . He openly admits he ’s crap at cooking so the fact he has offered to make me breakfast is quite pleasing . Resting my elbows on the worktop , I sit my chin in my palms and study him . He had a bad dream . Or nightmare . Either or , though , he told me , and that must have been hard . He ’s a big , strapping man who was reduced to a cowering mess by a bad dream . I hope they are not frequent because it was horrible seeing him like that – scared and vulnerable . I did n’t like it I sigh to myself . He looks as handsome as ever this morning . He ’s not shaved , and I love the one day stubble on him . He ’s has n’t got a full suit on , just charcoal grey trousers and a black shirt . I might change my mind about lunch so he is forced to give me a reminder fuck . I watch him gather the butter , knives and plates and place everything in front of me on the island . Then he goes back to the fridge , returning to sit next to me with a jar of peanut butter . I look at him in disbelief as he unscrews the lid and dunks his finger in . He wraps his lips around his coated finger and looks at me with it half hanging out of his luscious mouth . ‘
87751	87755	87756	87756	You	1032	’ he mumbles . ‘
87757	87770	87771	87771	I	363	’re giving me a hard time about a well - balanced breakfast ? ’
87785	87795	87782	87782	He	1032	‘ Nuts are very healthy . And anyway , you ’re
87801	87818	87819	87819	You	1032	’ I shake my head and start spreading butter on my toast as he watches me . ‘
87820	87825	87826	87826	I	363	’re important to me . ’
87849	87851	87846	87846	He	1032	‘ I ’m

88214	88218	88206	88206	he	363	‘ When then ? ’
88237	88242	88243	88243	He	363	‘ At The Manor . ’
88341	88350	88351	88351	I	363	‘ What was she doing at The Manor ? ’
88372	88380	88381	88381	He	431	‘ That is none of our business . ’
88396	88403	88381	88381	He	431	‘ I ’ve got to scram . ’

88463	88485	88453	88453	Jesse	431	‘ I ’ve decided that maybe lunch is n’t such a good idea . I do n’t want Kate to think we ’re
88491	88621	88622	88622	You	1041	’ I turn away from him and carry on eating my toast in the most blasé manner I can muster . It ’s hard when my man is bristling and snarling behind me . He grabs me , and I squeal as he flips my around and walks me to the wall , pinning me under his delicious body with my toast still in my hand . His eyes are uncertain and I almost feel guilty … almost . I know what ’s coming . I fight to conceal the grin that ’s tickling the corners of my mouth as he bends , leans into me and rolls his hips up so I get a full on stroke at my core . I moan in pure , sneaky satisfaction . ‘
88628	88647	88648	88648	I	363	’ he says , sliding his hand over my stomach , down towards the apex of my thighs . ‘
88651	88678	88679	88679	Someone	2607	’ I challenge , and then jerk as his thumb slips over my sensitive flesh . Oh God , I will never get enough of him . ‘
88686	88710	88679	88679	Someone	2607	’ he muses , as he continues to ride me with his hand . I sigh , savouring his talented touch working me . ‘
88720	88772	88773	88773	I	363	’ He withdraws his hand and steps back from me . WHAT ! I want to yank him back and shove his hand down below . What the hell is he playing at ? I look at him , all what - the - hell , and he smirks at me . ‘
88774	88809	88810	88810	He	1043	’m already late because I wanted to make sure you ate . If I knew you were going to play games with me , I would have fucked you first and feed you after . ’
88831	88835	88836	88836	he	1043	‘ One o’clock . ’
88850	88857	88858	88858	He	1043	‘ I love you , lady . ’
88866	88871	88872	88872	I	363	‘ You do n’t . ’
88875	88889	88872	88872	I	363	‘ If you did , you would n’t abandon me halfway to orgasm . ’
88890	88893	88894	88894	he	1043	‘ Hey ! ’
88901	88917	88897	88897	He	1043	‘ Do n’t ever question whether I love you . It ’ll make me mad . ’
88936	88974	88935	88935	I	363	’m struggling to convince my brain to do anything other than yank him back into me and make him sort me out . He ’s turned on , I can see . How is he walking away ? ‘
88980	88996	88997	88997	I	363	’ His eyes soften as he leans down and rests his lips on my cheek . ‘
88998	89008	88997	88997	I	363	’m going to miss you like crazy , baby . ’
89033	89059	89062	89062	Ava	0	’m ready , I make my way down , clinking on my heels through the foyer as I delve through my bag for my sunglasses . ‘
89064	89073	89062	89062	Ava	0	’ I hear Clive call to my back . ‘
89076	89150	89151	89151	John	564	’ I slip my shades on and emerge into the sunshine , coming to an abrupt halt when I spot John leaning against his Range Rover . Really ? He lifts his glasses up and shrugs his big shoulders at me . Oh good , he thinks this is stupid too , but I need my car today so I can collect my stuff from Matt ’s after work . I walk over . ‘
89159	89167	89151	89151	John	564	’ I say on a tired tone . ‘
89177	89187	89175	89175	girl	66	’ he rumbles . What ’s he talking about ? ‘
89194	89297	89175	89175	girl	66	’ He shrugs again and slides behind the wheel . I swing around and see an army of men cleaning my car . Oh , for God ’s sake . I drag my keys from my bag and find my car key missing . Later , I will be explaining to Mr Control Freak that snooping through a woman ’s handbag – and phone , come to think of it – is bloody rude . Why did n’t he consult me on this ? This is bad news . I could ring Kate . She ’ll take me . I dial her . ‘
89300	89305	89175	89175	girl	66	’ She ’s chirpy . ‘
89322	89334	89175	89175	girl	66	’ I spit my request out as fast as I can . ‘
89337	89338	89175	89175	girl	66	’ ‘
89356	89389	89352	89352	Jesse	431	’ I hang up and jump in next to John . He is wearing his usual ensemble of black suit and black shirt . How many black suits can one man have ? ‘
89399	89415	89418	89418	girl	66	’ I ask casually , flipping the visor down to put some lip gloss on . ‘
89420	89424	89418	89418	girl	66	’ he rumbles . ‘
89435	89458	89428	89428	I	363	’ I drop my hand into my lap and look over at John , who is tapping the steering wheel as usual . ‘
89472	89473	89461	89461	he	431	’ ‘
89476	89480	89481	89481	He	431	’ I frown . ‘
89485	89486	89481	89481	He	431	’ ‘
89489	89505	89481	89481	He	431	’ I sigh heavily , just so John knows that I want more than that . ‘
89508	89532	89533	89533	Girl	66	’ He looks at me , dazzling me with his white teeth , and I catch a glimpse of the illusive gold one . ‘
89553	89585	89546	89546	He	431	’ I sit back in my seat and listen to John commence humming to match his taps . Jesse ca n’t have never cared for anything . He ’s thirty seven . ‘
89591	89605	89606	89606	He	431	’ I ask on a smile , earning myself another dazzler from John . ‘
89623	89739	89619	89619	you	66	’ Oh no ! I die a thousand deaths on the spot and turn a thousand shades of red . I forgot Jesse had to be rescued . I bet John got a right eyeful . I start laughing to myself when I think of what John must have walked in on – a bedroom , with one naked God handcuffed to the bed , a diamante embellished vibrator , my new black lace underwear sprawled on the floor and the aforementioned naked God making holes in the wall with said vibrator . I bet John thought it was hilarious and Jesse obviously explained how and why he ended up handcuffed to the bed . I ’m
89862	89867	89856	89856	she	59	‘ Morning , Sally . ’
89898	89903	89904	89904	I	363	‘ Where is everyone ? ’
89980	89988	89989	89989	she	59	‘ Your telephone etiquette needs some work . ’

90021	90037	90040	90040	Kate	431	’ I sit down and come face to face with a big glass of wine . ‘
90047	90063	90040	90040	Kate	431	’ I shove it to her side of the table . She gives me daggers . ‘
90071	90092	90040	90040	Kate	431	’ Yes , I really do , but Jesse will be here soon and what would it look like if I ’m
90121	90130	90115	90115	she	59	‘ Kate , he ’ll be here soon . ’
90131	90139	90140	90140	she	59	‘ Hey ! Put the wine down ! ’
90147	90154	90140	90140	she	59	‘ He ’s not my boyfriend . ’
90199	90203	90186	90186	She	59	‘ You cow ! ’
90272	90278	90279	90279	Kate	431	‘ You did need it . ’
90284	90291	90292	90292	I	363	‘ Yes . And probably another . ’
90325	90343	90344	90344	I	363	‘ Oh , and do n’t tell Jesse you love him . It makes his head swell . ’
90355	90367	90352	90352	She	1061	‘ Shall I pick you up at six from your office ? ’
90384	90390	90352	90352	She	1061	‘ Is that all right ? ’
90414	90425	90405	90405	I	363	‘ Sure it is . Have you spoken to Matt ? ’
90426	90440	90399	90399	her	1061	‘ Yeah , he ’s expecting me , but Jesse does n’t know I ’m
90450	90463	90464	90464	He	431	’ I say warningly . Kate raises her eyebrows but says nothing . ‘
90468	90487	90464	90464	He	431	’ I shrug . I think that wine has gone straight to my head . I feel woozy . ‘
90492	90496	90497	90497	He	431	’ I ask . ‘
90527	90548	90516	90516	I	363	’ She says it like Jesse joining us is the only reason for her inviting Sam . I know different . ‘
90562	90576	90560	90560	Drew	68	’ I ask eagerly . Kate must know something . Her eyes widen . ‘
90585	90586	90560	90560	Drew	68	’ ‘
90589	90605	90560	90560	Drew	68	’ I sit forward , completely rapt with the obvious sign of dirt to dish . ‘
90621	90628	90615	90616	Little prissy	152	’ Kate is delighted , but I ’m
90760	90768	90769	90769	Kate	431	‘ What do you want to eat ? ’
90779	90790	90769	90769	Kate	431	‘ I ’ll have a BLT on granary , please . ’
90791	90796	90797	90797	I	363	‘ What about Jesse ? ’
90821	90829	90830	90830	I	363	‘ Ask if they have peanut butter . ’
90833	90837	90838	90838	She	1064	‘ Peanut butter ? ’
90847	90852	90856	90856	he	70	’m with her there . ‘
90859	90980	90856	90856	he	70	’ Kate tips her glass in the direction of the door , and I turn to look . I sigh in appreciation , as does Kate when Sam follows in behind him with Drew . She ’s playing her feelings for Sam down , I know she is . Jesse plants a chaste kiss on my cheek , and then pulls over a chair from another table for himself . He sits down next to me , slightly facing me , resting his hand on my knee . The warmth of his palm spreads up my leg , smacking me straight between the thighs . He does me no favours when he slowly strokes and squeezes , strokes and squeezes . ‘
90987	90995	90996	90996	Everyone	2502	’ I narrow accusing eyes on him . ‘
90999	91070	91071	91071	I	363	’ he asks , ignoring me and starting to circle his thumb on the inside of my thigh . I glance at him , finding he ’s smiling , knowing damn well what he ’s doing . I try and pull my leg away but he has none of it . He flips me a little scowl and an extra squeeze , his way for saying ; whenever and wherever . ‘
91072	91075	91076	91076	Kate	431	’m good . ’
91089	91091	91081	91081	she	1071	‘ I ’m
91099	91128	91129	91129	You	1072	’ She gets up . Everyone throws their order at her and she disappears to the bar , leaving me with the men . Jesse leans into me . ‘
91135	91139	91129	91129	You	1072	’ I tense . ‘
91145	91149	91150	91150	I	363	’ I blurt . ‘
91160	91166	91167	91167	He	363	’m with you , Ava . ’
91275	91282	91283	91283	Kate	431	‘ So , how is Victoria ? ’
91311	91316	91317	91317	He	431	‘ Do n’t ask . ’
91349	91364	91365	91365	he	431	‘ She ’s sweet , but God , she ’s got to lighten up . ’
91406	91415	91397	91397	He	431	‘ Why did you ask her to go ? ’
91452	91465	91449	91449	Drew	68	‘ It ’s who I am , it ’s what I like . ’
91466	91469	91470	91470	Sam	564	‘ Amen . ’
91561	91564	91565	91565	Drew	68	‘ Anyway , ’
91568	91619	91565	91565	Drew	68	‘ I ’ve got to make the most of it . Get to thirty five and it ’s a slippery slope down to a saggy arse and man boobs . I ’ll think about a woman who loves me for me and not for my body when I need to . ’
91697	91716	91717	91717	Kate	431	‘ Well , I ’ve only got nine years left , so I ’d better get my fill . ’
91749	91753	91748	91748	I	363	’m shocked . I ’m
91772	91829	91771	91771	they	3018	’re all talking about The Manor likes it ’s a perfectly regular set - up . No , not normal people . How can they be ? These three men have all dabbled and now Kate has been dragged to the dark side too . I need more wine . What the fuck is going on ? ‘
91839	91891	91912	91912	she	1084	’ Kate continues , waving her wine glass in the general direction of the men . I catch Sam winking at her , which only confirms for sure that she ’s definitely had some action . I want to drag her out of the bar and demand she explains herself . I ’m
91918	91928	91912	91912	she	1084	‘ Is that what happened to you , Jesse ? ’
91955	91958	91959	91959	He	431	‘ No . ’
91964	91969	91959	91959	He	431	‘ Do you think I ’m
91976	91995	91959	91959	He	431	’ He arches an expectant eyebrow at me . What a stupid question if ever there was one . ‘
92002	92006	91996	91996	You	1085	’ He grins . ‘
92010	92015	92016	92016	I	363	’m still your God ? ’
92027	92029	92030	92032	an arrogant God	2819	‘ You ’re
92034	92158	92030	92032	an arrogant God	2819	’ I mutter . He leans in and wraps his palm around my neck , dragging me towards him and hitting me with a completely over - the - top kiss . Despite my surroundings , I let him take me . As usual , my mind goes blank and nothing else exists , except for Jesse and his power over my entire being . Swallowed , swamped , taken … When he finally releases me , I look at the others , suddenly hugely embarrassed at his blatant display of affection . There is a chorus of mushy vocals and one vomiting gesture . It ’s Jesse . I look at him and he grins , then pulls me into his arms . ‘
92164	92168	92161	92161	you	1087	’ Kate scorns . ‘
92181	92193	92161	92161	you	1087	’ Sam reaches over and plants a kiss on her cheek . ‘
92198	92213	92216	92216	I	363	’ She bats him away as the waiter places our lunch on the table . ‘
92217	92220	92221	92221	Everyone	154	’m not ! ’
92304	92437	92439	92439	he	1091	’m suddenly attacked by the very unwelcome thought that is Jesse and dabbling . What if he ’s given up on the dabbling and is making do with me . He ’s retired , so to speak . Well , that just makes me feel shitty . I feel his hand stroking over my thigh as he picks at his sandwich with his damaged hand . It ’s looking a lot better , all the bruising nearly gone , but the red welts on his wrists are still there . They seem to be screaming at me ; look . My eyes snap to Jesse ’s when he nudges my knee with his . He gives me a questioning look , obviously noticing my line of sight and probably my reverie . I ’m
92464	92472	92473	92473	I	363	‘ I better get back to work . ’
92495	92512	92513	92513	I	363	’re eating with the owner of a super plush sex haven and two of its members . ‘
92514	92517	92518	92518	Jesse	431	’m coming . ’
92537	92548	92549	92549	I	363	‘ It ’s a two minute walk around the corner . ’
92603	92610	92595	92595	She	1094	‘ Jesse already settled the bill . ’
92629	92648	92620	92620	he	431	’ to notice my reproachful stare . He collects me and starts leading me out of the bar . ‘
92651	92658	92620	92620	he	431	’ Kate shouts to my back . ‘
92665	92754	92620	92620	he	431	’ I stop and spin round to face her , flashing a what - do - you - think - you’re - playing - at look . She does n’t seem to notice my reaction . No , she is too busy watching for Jesse ’s reaction to her request . I turn to look up at him . He ’s shifting uncomfortably . Oh Kate ! Fancy suggesting something so stupid . I see Sam and Drew both watching intently too , waiting for Jesse ’s response . ‘
92759	92768	92620	92620	he	431	’ I say as confidently as I can . ‘
92773	92793	92769	92769	You	1096	’ Jesse says from behind me . I can go ? What does he mean , I can go ? ‘
92808	92885	92888	92888	he	1096	’ I affirm . I do want to go , but I know he ’ll prohibit alcohol , the bloody control freak . I do n’t get legless all of the time , and the last time I did , it was his fault . I ’ve got so much to dump on Kate as well . Both of us have , by the sounds of things . This little lunch has only clipped the corners . ‘
92894	92898	92888	92888	he	1096	’ Kate complains . ‘
92906	92923	92888	92888	he	1096	’ I say dismissively , hoping she will take the bloody hint and shut her gob . ‘
92931	92935	92888	92888	he	1096	’ She winks . ‘
92938	93038	92888	92888	he	1096	’ I want to throw my bag at her , but then I feel Jesse tug me slightly , preventing me from following through on my intention . Instead , I toss another dirty look at her before turning and letting Jesse lead me out of the bar . We walk out onto Piccadilly into the lunchtime crowd , and I can feel the mild tension between us . He drops my hand and drapes an arm around my shoulder , pulling me into his side . When we turn into Berkeley Street , I stop and face him . ‘
93053	93054	93051	93051	I	363	’ ‘
93057	93071	93051	93051	I	363	’ he says flatly . I roll my eyes and carry on walking . ‘
93080	93117	93051	93051	I	363	’ He catches me up and replaces his arm over my shoulder . Yes , I can have a drink on Friday because he ’ll be there to watch over me . The problem is , I ’m
93142	93154	93155	93155	I	363	‘ Would you get the doormen to spy on me too ? ’
93158	93179	93155	93155	I	363	‘ I do n’t ask them to spy on you , Ava . I ask them to watch over you . ’
93180	93192	93193	93193	I	363	‘ And call you if I do n’t follow the rules ? ’
93205	93221	93222	93222	he	1099	‘ No , and call me if you are rolling around on the bar floor , ’
93226	93237	93222	93222	he	1099	‘ with your non - existent dress around your waist . ’
93367	93413	93366	93366	I	363	’m not rubbing his nose in it . I laugh to myself at my ambitious idea . He will never let me stay at Kate ’s . I let him hold me close to his side as we carry on our way to my office . ‘
93423	93453	93366	93366	I	363	’ I say as we near . Patrick might be there and I ’ve not mentioned any sort of business lunch with Mr Ward . This is painfully difficult . ‘
93456	93460	93366	93366	I	363	’ he grumbles . ‘
93474	93532	93366	93366	I	363	’ This I really want to know . Please let him say that he ’s got a stack of stuff to occupy himself with so I can get to Matt ’s and get my stuff without worrying about fobbing him off and lying to him . Withheld information is not the same as lying . He pouts . ‘
93537	93547	93366	93366	I	363	’ That does n’t make me feel any better . ‘
93561	93587	93588	93588	Ours	1104	’ I say , realising instantly that I ’ve just lied . I use every ounce of energy to stop myself reaching for my hair . ‘
93590	93594	93588	93588	Ours	1104	’ he corrects . ‘
93598	93599	93588	93588	Ours	1104	’ ‘
93604	93616	93588	93588	Ours	1104	’ Give or take an hour , I add to myself . ‘
93629	93654	93655	93655	ish	1105	’ He narrows his eyes on me , and I feel scrutinised . He ca n’t possibly know my plans . Only Kate knows . ‘
93657	93714	93715	93715	God	81	’ I counter , leaning on him for a kiss . He grabs me and leans me back over his arm in a ridiculous theatrical performance before kissing the life out of me in the middle of Berkeley Square . People sidestep us and tut as they pass , but I could n’t give a toss . ‘
93726	93736	93715	93715	God	81	’ he says against my lips . I grin . ‘
93742	93765	93737	93737	I	363	’ He pulls me back up to a vertical position and then buries his face in my neck to chew my ear . ‘
93780	93797	93805	93805	him	363	’ I know he ca n’t , he ’s pretty open on that fact , and I ’m
93826	93916	93825	93825	I	363	’m loving his mood – demands aside . My phone starts singing , snapping me from my rebellious brainwave , and I fish around in my bag while letting Jesse stick to my neck . When I lay my hands on it , I hold it above Jesse ’s head to see who it is . I groan . Of all the times Mikael could call , he calls now ? Jesse must detect my uneasiness because he instantly pulls back and looks at me with an enquiring eye . ‘
93921	93922	93926	93927	a client	658	’ ‘
93929	93944	93926	93927	a client	658	’ I shove my phone in my bag . I ’ll call him back . ‘
93953	93966	93926	93927	a client	658	’ I go to walk away , but he grasps my wrist . ‘

93994	93998	93992	93992	Mikael	388	’ I grate . ‘
94003	94083	94084	94084	Mikael	388	’ I add , to reinforce Mikael ’s status in my life . This might be one side of Jesse that I can not cure ; his insane jealousy and possessiveness . I yank my wrist free from him and start the short remaining distance to my office , leaving Jesse on the pavement . And he called me the green eyed monster ? My phone starts ringing again , and I retrieve it as I enter the office . ‘
94086	94090	94091	94091	Ava	0	’ I greet . ‘
94094	94102	94103	94103	His	388	’m calling to confirm our Monday appointment . ’

94232	94235	94217	94217	he	564	‘ Ava ? ’
94249	94258	94259	94259	Mikael	388	’m in the middle of a business call . ‘
94262	94265	94266	94266	I	363	’m sorry , ’
94292	94297	94298	94298	I	363	‘ Yes , fine . ’
94316	94321	94310	94310	I	363	‘ Are you okay ? ’
94334	94342	94328	94328	I	363	‘ Yes , fine , thank you . ’
94343	94354	94355	94355	My	363	‘ Good . So , you broke your own rule ? ’
94362	94365	94355	94355	My	363	‘ Pardon ? ’
94376	94387	94366	94366	I	363	‘ Jesse Ward . He ’s a client , yes ? ’
94414	94426	94413	94413	I	363	’m not stupid enough to point that out . Mikael knows I ’m
94455	94458	94449	94449	Jesse	431	‘ Yes . ’
94469	94478	94449	94449	Jesse	431	‘ How long you have been seeing him ? ’
94495	94503	94484	94484	I	363	‘ Urhhh , a month - ish . ’
94516	94524	94525	94525	he	564	‘ Hmmm . That ’s very interesting . ’
94542	94598	94541	94541	I	363	’m still staring into the green eyes of the man I would die for , and I ’ve got another man on the end of the phone sounding like he ’s got something to tell me – something that ’s going to send me crashing and burning from Central Jesse Cloud Nine , not that I ’m
94608	94614	94615	94615	I	363	‘ Why would it be ? ’
94635	94644	94632	94632	he	564	‘ We will discuss that when we meet . ’
94645	94648	94649	94649	I	363	‘ Okay . ’
94807	94842	94843	94843	I	363	’m reluctant to make the first move for fear of it all blowing up and Patrick coming to investigate the commotion . I ca n’t sit here all day looking at him , though . ‘
94844	94848	94849	94849	I	363	’m at work . ’
94872	94877	94864	94864	He	431	‘ Who was that ? ’
94884	94894	94895	94895	I	363	‘ You already know the answer to that question . ’
94932	94940	94941	94941	he	431	‘ You wo n’t see him again . ’
94955	94959	94954	94954	I	363	’m very worried . ‘
94962	94992	94993	94993	You	1120	’ I do n’t bother pointing out that Mikael is a client . He knows that and judging by the look on his face , he does n’t care . ‘
95014	95056	95006	95006	You	1120	’ He starts chewing that fucking lip , still brooding , still shaking with anger . I ca n’t do this here – not in the middle of my office . I also ca n’t withdraw from the Life contract . I ’m
95074	95082	95083	95083	I	363	‘ I ’ll see you at Lusso . ’
95087	95093	95094	95094	He	1121	‘ Yes , you will . ’
95138	95153	95137	95137	I	363	’m going to be worried about him for the rest of the afternoon . I ’m
95167	95188	95166	95166	I	363	’m not going back to Lusso tonight . I need time , clear thinking space to sort myself out before I ’m
95204	95215	95216	95216	Tom	70	‘ Gosh , that man can do a sexy brood , ’
95219	95229	95230	95230	He	431	‘ Been back to The Manor lately , darling ? ’
95353	95356	95357	95357	he	564	‘ Flower , ’
95387	95407	95381	95381	Patrick	564	‘ Now , Mikael Van Der Haus has been in touch and insisted on a research trip to Sweden . ’
95521	95527	95528	95528	I	363	‘ Is it really necessary ? ’
95539	95553	95554	95554	He	431	‘ Absolutely , Mikael insisted on it . I ’ll look at flights . ’
95575	95628	95631	95631	Ava	0	’m in trouble here . There is not a chance in hell that I ’ll get to Sweden , not with Jesse to stop me , and then where will that leave me ? I know where … job - less , that ’s where . I break out in a sweat . ‘
95633	95654	95631	95631	Ava	0	’ Sally appears from the stationary cupboard , looking as miserable as she did earlier . I need wine desperately . ‘
95660	95721	95658	95658	Sally	59	’ I answer . I look up and see Tom and Victoria with their heads down . Good . I can spend the rest of the afternoon worrying about my life drama in peace . I suddenly wish I did n’t have to pick my stuff up after work . Seeing Matt is the last thing I want to do . ‘
95738	95822	95823	95823	I	363	’ He hands me a print out of scheduled flights and I shove it in my bag . I ’ll think about that later . He leaves me in peace and I feebly try to carry on with my work . Chapter 14 Six o’clock approaches and I start clearing my desk . Everyone else has left , so it ’s down to me to do the office checks and lock up . Kate pulls up in Margo Junior and I jump in . ‘
95838	95870	95874	95874	you	1131	’ I fire at her immediately as I settle and put my belt on . In my huffy state , I begrudgingly marvel at the comfort of Kate ’s new van . ‘
95877	95884	95885	95885	He	431	’ She pulls into the traffic . ‘
95897	95898	95885	95885	He	431	’ ‘
95935	95939	95927	95927	I	363	’ She laughs . ‘
95943	95947	95927	95927	I	363	’ I scoff . ‘
95958	95959	95960	95960	Pah	157	’ ‘
95972	95973	95970	95970	rebels	1132	’ ‘
95982	96011	96012	96012	He	431	’ I laugh , although I really feel like being a rebel at the moment . I feel like getting drunk , but that would just be thoughtless . ‘
96042	96062	96029	96032	Mikael Van Der Haus	388	’ I blurt it out , still racing through reasons for Mikael to find my relationship with Jesse interesting . ‘
96065	96066	96029	96032	Mikael Van Der Haus	388	’ ‘
96083	96096	96079	96079	he	431	’ Kate swings her blues to me with a look of excitement . ‘
96099	96103	96079	96079	he	431	’ I nod . ‘

96127	96132	96079	96079	he	431	’ she says dramatically . ‘
96147	96148	96149	96149	I	363	’ ‘
96159	96188	96151	96151	Jesse	431	’ I do n’t know why I have completely , unashamedly admitted that because I know she ’ll be pumping me for more information . Do I care ? ‘
96200	96201	96189	96189	You	1134	’ ‘
96204	96244	96189	96189	You	1134	’ I shrug . There ’s a lot more than his age . A lot more , but I need wine to delve into that shit . I need a night out to off load it all on Kate . ‘
96251	96259	96189	96189	You	1134	’ She frowns . There we are . ‘
96273	96279	96262	96262	Jesse	431	’ I look at her . ‘
96292	96311	96312	96312	Kate	431	’ I add dryly . She bursts into laughter and the van swerves . I grab the door . ‘
96314	96315	96312	96312	Kate	431	’ ‘
96318	96322	96312	96312	Kate	431	’ she splutters . ‘
96329	96348	96325	96325	I	363	’ I ’ve got so much to push on her , but her own situation is worrying me . ‘
96358	96364	96325	96325	I	363	’ She stops laughing immediately . ‘
96367	96377	96325	96325	I	363	’ I roll my eyes on a dramatic sigh . ‘
96383	96384	96325	96325	I	363	’ ‘
96398	96420	96325	96325	I	363	’ she asks , in an obvious diversion from my enquiries . I inwardly groan . Am I even going now ? ‘
96435	96436	96426	96426	Jesse	431	’ ‘
96445	96449	96439	96439	He	431	’ she muses . ‘
96458	96459	96460	96460	I	363	’ ‘
96461	96486	96487	96487	I	363	’m not looking forward to it . I ’ve not been there since last Sunday , and that pouty faced tramp will be there . ’
96592	96601	96602	96602	Kate	431	‘ Do you want me to come in ? ’
96662	96673	96653	96653	I	363	‘ No , I ’ll bring it out to you . ’
96684	96766	96683	96683	I	363	’m feeling sicker by the minute . Jesse ’s already crazy mad over a stupid telephone call . I would call him unreasonable if it had n’t been for Mikael ’s line of conversation , but Jesse does n’t know what was said , although his reaction speaks volumes . I make my way up the steps and press the buzzer for our apartment , looking up at my building and feeling unexpectedly sad that I do n’t live here anymore . ‘
96769	96779	96683	96683	I	363	’ Matt ’s happy voice comes over the intercom . ‘
96782	96804	96807	96807	he	1139	’ I say as informally as I can . I do n’t want to get into friendly conversation with him . I ’m
96816	96823	96807	96807	he	1139	‘ I ’ll buzz you in . ’
96844	97065	96843	96843	I	363	’m going in . She puts her thumb up and flashes her mobile at me . I nod my understanding and step into the corridor of the downstairs entrance hall . Making my way up the stairs , I take calming breaths while giving myself a mental pep talk . I must not mention the call to my parents and I must not get involved in too much conversation . When I reach the top , I see the front door open slightly . Shaking myself up , I walk straight in . I do n’t shut the door ; I do n’t plan on being here long . I look in the kitchen and lounge for Matt , but he is nowhere to be seen , so I head for the bedroom and find my stuff piled in bags and boxes . With Matt nowhere to be found , I start collecting a few bags up in my hands , but when I turn to leave the room , I find Matt stood in the doorway with a glass of red wine in his hand . He ’s wearing his beige suit . I ’ve always hated that suit , not that I ’ve told him . His dark hair is in its usual side parting and combed neatly . ‘
97068	97080	96843	96843	I	363	’ he says on an over - the - top smile . ‘
97088	97097	97098	97098	Kate	431	’ I explain as I lift the bags . ‘
97113	97155	97105	97105	I	363	’ There ’s no hiding the hostility that develops at the mention of Kate ’s name , but I ignore it and walk with purpose to the door , stopping when he makes no attempt to get out of my way . ‘
97159	97225	97105	97105	I	363	’ My politeness is killing me . He smiles at me , then takes a cocky swig of his wine before standing back a fraction , giving me just enough room to slip past and make my way down to Kate . When she sees me emerging from the building , she jumps out of her van and runs around to open the back doors . ‘
97230	97240	97241	97241	He	1144	’ she says , taking the bags from me . ‘
97247	97261	97241	97241	He	1144	’ I nod at the bags and raise a brow . She smirks . ‘
97269	97359	97241	97241	He	1144	’ I return to the apartment and grab a few more . It would be quicker if Kate came and got a few , but the pick - up has been quite straight forward and pain free up till now . Introducing Kate into the equation is a sure fire way to send the situation into anarchy , so I traipse back and forth , shifting my worldly possessions alone . I notice Matt does n’t offer to help . I hand my ninth and tenth bag to Kate . ‘
97364	97372	97241	97241	He	1144	’ She thrusts them in the van . ‘
97377	97427	97428	97428	Ava	0	’ I say on an about turn . He better have packed everything because I do n’t want to come back . I make my way back up and grab the final box , turning to make my hasty exit , but I find Matt blocking my escape again . ‘
97434	97442	97428	97428	Ava	0	’ he asks hopefully . I cringe . ‘
97447	97490	97491	97491	Us	1145	’ I know damn well what this is about . I need to get out of here . I ca n’t rehash this shit again . The last time I rejected his proposal to give it another shot , he turned nasty . ‘
97493	97501	97502	97502	Matt	2587	’ He waves his hand between us . ‘
97505	97513	97514	97514	I	363	’m not going to change my mind . ’
97561	97569	97570	97570	I	363	‘ What the hell are you doing ? ’
97584	97590	97574	97574	He	2587	‘ Reminding you of why we ’re
97594	97635	97574	97574	He	2587	’ he spits . I actually laugh . It ’s a proper belly laugh . He ’s reminding me ? Of what ? How much of a twat he is ? Please ! A Jesse style reminder it is not . ‘
97642	97646	97651	97651	your	1146	’ he asks . ‘
97654	97655	97651	97651	your	1146	’ ‘
97665	97688	97651	97651	your	1146	’ he snipes . I take a long , steady breath to prevent my hand flying out and cracking him one . I ’m
97715	97724	97725	97725	I	363	‘ Get out of my way , Matt . ’
97726	97737	97738	97738	You	1146	’m immensely proud of myself for keeping my voice even . ‘
97742	97751	97738	97738	You	1146	’ he sneers . My eyes widen . I ’m
97772	97787	97768	97768	I	363	‘ Yes , I am seeing someone and do you know what , Matt ? ’
97797	97806	97807	97807	I	363	‘ He ’s the best I ’ve had . ’
97823	97851	97814	97814	He	2587	‘ He ’s a raving alcoholic , Ava . Did you know that ? He ’s probably drunk out of his skull every time he fucks you . ’
97869	97875	97865	97865	he	2587	’m seeing ? He thinks I ’m
97891	97899	97890	97890	I	363	’m shocked because he must know who I ’m
97922	97937	97911	97911	his	2587	‘ Well , even pissed he ’s a better fuck than you ever were . ’
97975	98025	97974	97974	I	363	’m delighted with myself for being so quick off the mark . He always liked to think he was handy in the bedroom . He was n’t . I can see him struggling , clearly wondering how he should deal with me . I stand my ground , but I ’m
98036	98038	98031	98031	he	2587	‘ You ’re
98041	98045	98047	98047	Matt	2587	’ he snarls . ‘
98050	98062	98063	98063	His	2587	’m making up for four years of shit sex with you . ’
98108	98111	98112	98112	he	2587	‘ Ava ! ’
98142	98190	98139	98139	he	2587	’m here ? I ’ll kill Kate if she ’s tattled on me . He comes bulldozing through the door and any notion I had that I ’ve seen him in all of his challenging ways has just been thoroughly obliterated . He ’s rampant , and I ’m
98236	98245	98246	98246	he	2587	‘ What the FUCK are you doing here ? ’
98277	98287	98276	98276	I	363	’m here . How the hell does he know I ’m
98316	98320	98321	98321	he	2587	‘ Answer me ! ’
98333	98405	98406	98406	I	363	’m doing here , he does n’t need my confirmation , and he must have seen the bags in the back of Kate ’s van . Matt wisely stands back and keeps his cocky mouth shut . His eyes are flicking from me to Jesse , and I know he ’s thinking that this is not the behaviour of a man just fucking a woman . Hey , meet my God ! ‘
98428	98439	98423	98423	John	564	’ He waves his arms around like a deranged screwball . ‘
98448	98491	98423	98423	John	564	’ I hear a snigger escape Matt ’s lips , and I whip my eyes around to him . He looks at me and I see a glint of sick satisfaction in his eyes . It tips me over the edge . I ’m
98537	98541	98544	98544	Matt	2587	‘ We kissed . ’
98674	98681	98682	98682	she	1154	‘ Holy fucking shit , Ava . ’
98694	98703	98682	98682	she	1154	‘ Did you tell Sam I was here ? ’
98708	98711	98712	98712	she	1154	‘ No ! ’
98727	98730	98731	98731	Jesse	431	‘ John ! ’
98740	98748	98734	98734	he	431	‘ Put her stuff in the Rover . ’
98786	98791	98792	98792	I	363	‘ Leave it John ! ’
98801	98803	98796	98796	John	564	‘ I ’m
98814	98872	98809	98809	Kate	431	’ I start towards the passenger side of Kate ’s van and when I get to the door , I look up and see Sam with his hand on Kate ’s arm . She looks at Sam and he shakes his head faintly , then she looks back to me . I can see she is torn . ‘
98879	98886	98877	98877	John	564	’ Jesse thunders down the steps . ‘
98890	98946	98877	98877	John	564	’ I shout . I see John blow out an exasperated breath of air and look at Jesse for guidance , but he must decide that my wrath is the lesser of two evils because he starts transferring my things into the Range Rover . He can take my things . It does n’t mean I ’m
98976	98979	98980	98980	His	431	‘ Out ! ’
99012	99019	99004	99004	he	431	‘ Jesse . Just fuck off ! ’
99020	99023	99004	99004	he	431	‘ Mouth ! ’
99024	99028	99029	99029	I	363	‘ FUCK OFF ! ’
99053	99079	99052	99052	I	363	’m shaking , trembling with fury . How dare he ? How dare he behave like this after everything I ’ve been through with him . ‘
99085	99164	99052	99052	I	363	’ He leans in and grabs me . I fight him off , but my strength compared to his is pathetic . He manhandles me out of Margo Junior and stands me with my back facing his front , while I persistently struggle to bat him away . He wraps an arm around my waist and lifts me clean from the ground , carrying me to his car while I kick and scream like a three year old . ‘
99169	99170	99052	99052	I	363	’ ‘
99178	99195	99176	99176	Ava	0	’ he grates , which only assists in encouraging me to fight him some more . I ’m
99218	99292	99217	99217	I	363	’m mortified ! I ca n’t believe he has gone off the rails like this . I was handling it fine . I was on my way out , and then neurotic arse here rocked up and threw the shit right in the fan . I want to throw my head back and scream to the heavens . I wriggle a little more and try and prize his arm from around my waist . ‘
99300	99338	99298	99298	Ava	0	’ he warns . Looking up , I see numerous bystanders halted in their daily business , all watching the dramatic happenings unfolding before their eyes . I give in with my struggle , but mainly because I ’m
99377	99385	99366	99366	He	1163	‘ You had better stay fucking put ! ’
99439	99475	99438	99438	I	363	’m also moving out of Lusso , not that I really moved in , although Jesse would completely disagree with that . I see him walk back over to John , Kate and Sam . They ’re
99527	99663	99526	99526	I	363	’m the one who ’s just been abducted by a wild fucking maniac ? John shakes his head and clips the side of Jesse ’s jaw with his knuckles , but Jesse pulls back from it harshly . I lip read John ’s calm down and watch as Jesse walks away , throwing his arms in the air before yanking his dark blonde , disheveled hair in frustration . John shakes his head and this time I know he just said mother fucker . Good ! This is an indication that John agrees with me . Nasty qualities , I think John said . You do n’t get much nastier than this . He ’s completely lost the plot . I look out of the passenger window when he climbs back in the car . I ’m
99704	99712	99703	99703	I	363	’m not looking forward to this journey . ‘
99721	99763	99703	99703	I	363	’ I keep my eyes firmly on the view whizzing past my window . I hear him wince as he takes a corner and out of my peripheral vision , I see him shake his hand . He ’s upset it . ‘
99770	99771	99703	99703	I	363	’ ‘
99776	99793	99794	99794	I	363	’ I turn and look at his scowling profile . He ’s still a handsome beast . ‘
99802	99828	99829	99829	I	363	’ I accuse . He whips his head around to face me . I meet his stare with the same fierceness he ’s giving me . ‘
99830	99841	99829	99829	I	363	’m fucking infuriated with you . Did you kiss him ? ’
99842	99845	99846	99846	I	363	‘ No ! ’
99849	99863	99846	99846	I	363	‘ He tried and I beat him off . I was just leaving . ’
99883	99891	99874	99874	I	363	‘ Do n’t ever fucking tell me I ’m
99905	99906	99907	99907	You	363	’ ‘
99912	99913	99914	99914	Ava	0	’ ‘

99950	99954	99955	99955	You	363	’ I scoff . ‘
99956	99960	99961	99961	I	363	’re imagining things . ’
99962	99993	99961	99961	I	363	’m fully aware that he ’s not . He ’s totally right , but what I want to know is why Mikael is suddenly interested in my relationship with Jesse . ‘
100000	100001	99998	99998	Mikael	388	’ ‘
100004	100008	99998	99998	Mikael	388	’ he snaps . ‘
100013	100035	99998	99998	Mikael	388	’ I can tell by the disappearance of his bottom lip between his teeth that he ’s thinking hard about this . ‘
100051	100052	100053	100053	He	388	’ ‘
100080	100086	100078	100078	he	388	’ His head whips around . ‘
100098	100099	100100	100100	I	363	’ ‘
100122	100143	100120	100120	Jesse	431	’ I can feel myself losing control . I look away from him , trying to take some calming breaths . ‘
100152	100153	100120	100120	Jesse	431	’ ‘
100156	100183	100184	100184	He	388	’ I shout , throwing my face in his direction again , but he refuses to look at me . He punches the steering wheel again . ‘
100193	100194	100184	100184	He	388	’ ‘
100198	100199	100200	100200	He	388	’ ‘
100205	100386	100387	100388	Fucking man	1177	’ he roars . I jump back in my seat , shocked and unsatisfied by his vague , furious answer . This conversation will get us nowhere . He needs to calm down and so do I. I ’ll ask my questions when he ’s not looking like he may put his fist through the window . He pulls up outside Lusso and I exit the car before he turns the engine off . I notice John pull into the car park as I enter the foyer , and I completely ignore Clive as he comes out from behind his desk . I head straight for the elevator . I expect Jesse to stop the doors from shutting so he can get in , but he does n’t . He ’s obviously concluded that we both need to calm down as well . I exit the lift and fish my pink key from the side pocket of my bag to let myself in before I slam the door behind me and chuck my bag on the floor in a temper . ‘
100390	100396	100387	100388	Fucking man	1177	’ I curse to myself . ‘
100399	100440	100387	100388	Fucking man	1177	’ A small voice says . I look up and see a grey haired , middle aged woman stood in front of me . I suppose I should be concerned by this strange woman in Jesse ’s penthouse , but I ’m
100444	100451	100452	100452	I	363	‘ Who the hell are you ? ’
100477	100480	100481	100481	she	886	‘ Cathy . ’
100484	100490	100481	100481	she	886	‘ I work for Jesse . ’
100491	100494	100495	100495	I	363	‘ What ? ’
100563	100580	100581	100581	he	431	‘ Cathy , you should probably get off now . I ’ll speak to you tomorrow . ’
100596	100600	100581	100581	he	431	‘ Of course . ’
100625	100639	100640	100640	She	886	‘ I ’ve put dinner in the oven . Give it thirty minutes . ’
100729	100760	100728	100728	I	363	’m not staying here . I stomp into the kitchen and yank the fridge open , hoping a bottle of wine might have magically found its way in there . I ’m
100881	100988	100880	100880	I	363	’m probably more at home than Jesse ; he ’s not even lived here for a month and one week of that was spent ridiculously drunk or unconscious . I wander over to the chaise lounge in the window and gaze out across the docks . The people down below are going about their everyday business , strolling around or having an evening drink in the bars , all looking untroubled and relaxed . It ’s probably not the case for all of them , but in my messed up state , I selfishly think that no one else could be as troubled as me . I ’m
101177	101244	101176	101176	I	363	’m going to find out anytime soon – unless I ask Mikael … The door flies open and Jesse comes crashing in , looking like he ’s been electrocuted . He ’s visibly shaking and the main artery in his neck is bulging . While I ’ve calmed significantly , he , it would seem , has not . He holds up something in his hand . ‘
101251	101284	101176	101176	I	363	’ He looks like he could spontaneously combust at any moment . I frown but then realise he ’s holding up the flight details that Patrick gave me . Oh Jesus , I ’m
101301	101309	101310	101310	I	363	‘ You ’ve been through my bag ! ’
101311	101395	101310	101310	I	363	’m shocked . I do n’t know why , he does it all the fucking time . He does n’t look ashamed or apologetic . He just waves the paper in front of my face while his chest puffs in and out erratically . I push past him and storm downstairs to my bag , hearing him follow me , his heavy breathing almost louder than his charging footsteps . I rip my bag from the floor and take it into the kitchen . ‘
101403	101407	101310	101310	I	363	’ he shouts . ‘
101418	101446	101310	101310	I	363	’ He thrusts the paper under my nose as I dump my bag on the island and start rummaging through it . I have no idea what I ’m
101450	101469	101470	101470	His	1192	‘ You are not fucking going to Sweden or Denmark or any fucking where , for that matter ! ’
101493	101501	101479	101479	I	363	‘ Do n’t go through my bag . ’
101535	101546	101517	101517	He	1192	‘ Why , what else are you hiding from me ? ’
101547	101550	101479	101479	I	363	‘ Nothing ! ’
101551	101560	101561	101561	He	1192	‘ Let me tell you something , lady . ’
101572	101588	101561	101561	He	1192	‘ I will die before I let you leave the country with that womanising prick . ’
101599	101606	101607	101607	I	363	‘ He wo n’t be coming ! ’
101647	101671	101672	101672	I	363	‘ Yes , he will . He ’ll follow you there , trust me . He ’s relentless in his pursuit of women . ’
101676	101682	101672	101672	I	363	‘ Just like you did ? ’
101683	101688	101689	101689	he	1192	‘ That was different ! ’
101710	101712	101692	101692	He	1192	‘ You ’re
101715	101727	101692	101692	He	1192	’ I spit . I ’ve lost the will to live . ‘
101736	101743	101744	101744	You	1194	’ He scowls good and proper . ‘
101745	101752	101754	101754	he	1192	’re pregnant , are n’t you ? ’
101804	101812	101803	101803	I	363	’m losing it in a big way . ‘
101820	101839	101803	101803	I	363	’ I yell , and he looks at me like I could possibly be a fruit loop . I ’m
101842	101845	101846	101846	He	1192	‘ Why ? ’
101855	101868	101869	101869	He	1192	‘ You put your body through the mill . Have you forgotten ? ’
101872	101886	101887	101887	He	1192	‘ I do n’t need pills , Ava . I ’ve told you . ’
101902	101925	101926	101926	He	1192	‘ I am not a fucking alcoholic . If I drink now , it will be because you make me crazy mad ! ’
101935	101943	101926	101926	He	1192	‘ You blame this all on me . ’
101948	101972	101947	101947	I	363	’m not asking it as a question because he has already shouted it in my face . He drops me and walks away . ‘
101979	101992	101975	101975	I	363	’ His hands yank on the back of his hair in frustration . ‘
102008	102014	102004	102006	rich Dutch men	1196	’ He glares at me . ‘
102023	102024	102025	102025	Cosy	158	’ ‘
102027	102038	102042	102042	man	1197	’ I splutter . He thinks seeing Matt was cosy ? ‘
102044	102045	102042	102042	man	1197	’ ‘
102048	102049	102042	102042	man	1197	’ ‘
102053	102105	102042	102042	man	1197	’ I shout . He really is on another planet . If he knows me as well as he claims he does , then he would n’t be throwing such stupid insinuations around . He throws his hands in the air in a Lord - give - me - strength gesture . ‘
102115	102134	102042	102042	man	1197	’ he bellows . He clenches his teeth , and I see the muscles of his jaw ticking . ‘
102159	102256	102261	102261	he	1198	’ He stalks out of the kitchen . I hear the front door slam and moments later , an almighty crash . I run out to the penthouse foyer and Jesse is nowhere to be seen , but the mirrored door of the elevator is shattered into a million pieces . Through my derangement , I instantly think of what further damage he has done to his poor hand . Then , I cry . Hopeless , howl at the moon , blubbering . I feel completely helpless and out of control . I feel like I ’m
102286	102396	102285	102285	I	363	’m battling with the incessant niggling thought that it ’s me who has made him like this . It ’s not healthy . I walk back into the big open living area and see all of my bags placed in a neat row at the side of the stairs . What should I do with them ? Am I staying ? I leave them and not knowing what else to do , I go and sit myself on a sun lounger on the decking area and cry to myself – loud , shoulder shaking , pouring tears crying , while I try to find some direction and guidance . I ’m
102407	102615	102406	102406	I	363	’m staring into space and feeling nothing but abandoned . Familiar feelings , all of which I never wanted to feel again , are flooding back into me – the empty feeling , the lost , lonely and dejected emotions that had me residing in the lowest levels of hell while Jesse was n’t in my life . How have I come to need him so much ? How has this happened to me ? He ’s walked out , and now I ’ve got a good idea of how he felt when I did the same to him . It ’s not a nice feeling . I feel like a massive part of me is missing . It is . The thought of him not being around makes my heart jump into my throat , makes my breath hitch and panic attack me . This is hopeless . I take myself back into the penthouse , upstairs to the master - suite and have a shower . I stand under the sprays of water absentmindedly soaping myself . Everywhere I turn , I see us – me and Jesse on the vanity unit , against the wall , on the floor , in the shower . We ’re
102760	102767	102748	102748	His	564	‘ He ’s here , Ava . ’
102768	102772	102773	102773	I	363	‘ The Manor ? ’
102774	102791	102773	102773	I	363	’m so relieved but at the same time , I wonder what he ’s doing there . ‘
102794	102805	102773	102773	I	363	’ John sounds regretful . It makes me straighten up . ‘
102810	102817	102807	102807	I	363	’ I do n’t know why I ’m
102821	102839	102842	102842	girl	66	’m on my way back up the stairs to get dressed . He hums down the phone . ‘
102851	103000	103001	103001	Ava	0	’ I hang up and scrape my wet hair up before shoving my discarded work clothes back on . My car keys . Jesse has n’t given me my car keys back . I fly downstairs and dive into the boxes of my belongings , praying I ’ll find the spare set . Eventually , I lay my hands on them . I get to the smashed elevator and punch the code in , at the same time thinking that Clive wo n’t be happy . Since I ’ve been here , the maintenance bill must have gone through the roof . I run through the foyer in my heels and notice Clive knelt down behind his desk . I swiftly pass him without a word . I ’ve no time for him this evening . The poor man will wonder what he has done to upset me . ‘
103003	103033	103001	103001	Ava	0	’ I hear him yell after me . I would n’t stop , but it sounds like something is seriously wrong . Maybe the mystery woman has been back . ‘
103039	103048	103037	103037	Clive	76	’ He runs towards me in a panic . ‘
103054	103061	103062	103063	Mr Ward	340	’ What ’s he talking about ? ‘
103065	103069	103070	103070	He	340	’ he pants . ‘
103083	103087	103088	103088	Clive	76	’ He what ? ‘
103097	103110	103088	103088	Clive	76	’ I carry on my way , but he grasps my arm . ‘
103122	103140	103141	103141	Clive	76	’ I do n’t believe this . He ’s got the concierge performing prisoner guard duties now ? ‘
103152	103157	103141	103141	Clive	76	’ I point out . ‘
103166	103167	103141	103141	Clive	76	’ ‘
103185	103186	103178	103179	Mr Ward	340	’ ‘
103192	103193	103190	103190	Clive	76	’ ‘
103200	103204	103205	103205	he	340	’re talking about . ’
103245	103255	103228	103228	I	363	‘ Where do you keep Mr Ward ’s numbers ? ’
103293	103310	103282	103282	Clive	76	‘ It ’s all linked to the phone through the system . Why do you ask ? ’
103311	103323	103324	103324	I	363	‘ Do you have Mr Ward ’s number on your mobile ? ’
103327	103347	103324	103324	I	363	‘ No Ava , It ’s all pre - programmed into the system . Resident ’s confidentiality and all . ‘
103350	103470	103324	103324	I	363	’ I yank out the wires leading from the phone system to the computer and drop them in a tangled mess to the floor where they meet Clive ’s jaw . I hear the poor old boy ’s shocked mumbling on my way out and feel a small pang of guilt . That will be yet another repair bill falling on the doormat of the penthouse . I jump in my car and instantly notice a little black device on the dashboard . I know what that is . I press the button and , like I knew they would , the gates to Lusso start opening . The whole way to The Manor , I pray repeatedly that I ’m
103706	103710	103712	103712	he	564	’re all here . ‘
103716	103754	103712	103712	he	564	’ I ask as we reach the summer room . There are people scattered around the seating areas , drinking and talking , probably discussing what the evening could have in store for each of them . I ’m
103774	103785	103786	103786	John	564	‘ Damn , girl , you affect that mother fucker . ’
103822	103828	103829	103829	I	363	‘ My man is challenging . ’
103854	103882	103832	103832	John	564	‘ Challenging ? That ’s a word . I call him a fucking pain in the arse . I ’ve got to admire his determination , though . ’
103883	103886	103887	103887	I	363	‘ Determination ? ’
103893	103899	103900	103900	I	363	‘ Determination to be challenging ? ’
103912	103923	103903	103903	John	564	‘ I ’ve never seen him so determined to live . ’
103948	103956	103957	103957	I	363	‘ What do you mean by that ? ’
104040	104050	104051	104051	John	564	‘ Trust me , it ’s a good thing . ’
104057	104063	104051	104051	John	564	‘ Be easy on him . ’
104064	104074	104037	104037	he	564	‘ How long have you known him , John ? ’
104082	104095	104096	104096	He	564	‘ Long enough , girl . I ’ll leave you to it . ’
104110	104115	104116	104116	I	363	‘ Thanks , John . ’
104122	104131	104116	104116	I	363	‘ S’all good , girl . S’all good . ’
104202	104419	104201	104201	I	363	’m immediately insulted by what I see . Jesse is sat in his big office chair facing Sarah , who is perched on the corner of his desk . The woman is a leech . A thud of possessiveness slaps me in the face , but it ’s the bottle of vodka sat on Jesse ’s desk that has me more fretful . I can fight off unwanted female attention , as long as it ’s unwanted . The vodka is another matter entirely . They look up at me in unison , and she flashes me a fake , insincere smile . Then I notice a bag of ice resting on Jesse ’s hand . I was right to have a touch of the green eyed monster . They look , in Jesse ’s words , very cosy . Now there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these two have had a sexual relationship . It ’s written all over her face . I feel sick , jealous and dangerously possessive . The brazen interloper makes no attempt to shift her toned arse off Jesse ’s desk . She just sits there , relishing in the obvious tension her presence is causing , but it ’s the impostor in clear bottle form that I ’m
104431	104561	104430	104430	I	363	’m in no mood for silly games with ex - sexual conquests . I look at Jesse , and he meets my gaze . He ’s still in his charcoal trousers , but the sleeves of his black shirt are rolled up . His dirty blonde hair is a glorious mess on top of his beautiful head , but despite him in all of his loveliness , he looks fearful and uneasy . I do n’t blame him . I ’ve just walked in on him looking cosy with another woman and with a bottle of the evil stuff in front of him . It ’s my worst nightmares wrapped into one . He slowly turns his chair with his feet , away from the interloper and towards me . ‘
104568	104586	104430	104430	I	363	’ My voice is even and strong . I feel anything but . He shakes his head . ‘
104589	104598	104430	104430	I	363	’ he answers in a quiet voice . I ’m
104670	104686	104688	104688	you	1223	’m not naive enough to believe that she is trying to be a supportive friend . ‘
104691	104704	104669	104669	I	363	’ I look directly at her so there ’s no mistaking who I ’m
104727	104764	104766	104766	me	363	’m suddenly furious with myself for allowing another woman the opportunity to comfort him , especially this woman . That ’s my job . Jesse pulls his arm away and her hand falls to the desk . ‘
104768	104781	104766	104766	me	363	’ she splutters , which only serves to fuck me off more . ‘
104786	104881	104766	104766	me	363	’ I flash her a don’t - fuck - with - me glare and she smirks an almost undetectable smirk . She knows that I know her game . That should make our relationship a lot easier . Jesse flicks his eyes nervously between the two women having a stand - off in his office . God bless him , he ’s keeping his mouth firmly shut , but then the cheeky bitch only leans down and kisses him on the cheek , letting her lips linger there for longer than is really necessary . ‘
104891	105002	105005	105005	Sarah	59	’ she says in the most ridiculous seductive voice I ’ve ever heard . Jesse stiffens from head to toe and looks at me , all wide eyed and with an alarmed look plastered all over his handsome face . He ’s right to be anxious , especially after the barrel of shit he ’s just thrown at me because of a male client and an ex - boyfriend . Matt and Mikael would be a mass of body parts if the boot was on the other foot . I grab his office door and open it wide before fixing my eyes on the blonde , larger than life tramp . ‘
105007	105060	105005	105005	Sarah	59	’ I say with optimum finality . She looks at me with a cocky , self - assured , pouty face and slides off Jesse ’s desk , sauntering across his office at a leisurely pace while giving me the eyeball . I hold her cocky face with my own take no prisoners ’
105071	105116	105070	105070	I	363	’m holding open for her . As soon as her six inch platform heels are over the threshold , I slam it behind her and silently hope it collided with her toned arse . Now , let ’s deal with my challenging man . I ’m
105199	105205	105206	105206	I	363	‘ Why is that there ? ’
105210	105216	105217	105217	he	1225	‘ I do n’t know . ’
105240	105248	105220	105220	His	1225	‘ Do you want to drink it ? ’
105249	105253	105217	105217	he	1225	‘ Not now you ’re
105256	105265	105266	105266	You	1227	’ His quiet words register loud and clear . ‘
105272	105277	105278	105278	I	363	’ I remind him . ‘
105281	105282	105278	105278	I	363	’ ‘
105291	105300	105278	105278	I	363	’ That ’s the operative question here . I ’m
105405	105413	105414	105414	He	1225	‘ I would n’t have drunk it . ’
105448	105523	105447	105447	I	363	’m the reason for his screwed up mind , his ridiculously ambitious objectives and his meltdowns . This is my entire fault . I ’ve made him into a neurotic control freak . We remain looking at each other for a few moments , my mind racing with all of the things we need to sort out , while he bites his bottom lip , clearly not knowing what to say to me . I ’m
105531	105537	105538	105538	I	363	‘ Why is it there ? ’
105578	105589	105590	105590	His	1225	‘ I was n’t going to drink it , Ava . ’
105597	105600	105596	105596	I	363	’m staggered . ‘
105609	105622	105624	105624	you	1229	’ His eyes fly to mine , panic invading his handsome face . ‘
105630	105631	105632	105632	You	1229	’ ‘

105677	105683	105684	105684	he	1225	‘ His wife left him . ’
105691	105698	105684	105684	he	1225	‘ Because you slept with her . ’
105699	105702	105660	105660	he	1225	‘ Yes . ’
105703	105706	105660	105660	he	1225	‘ When ? ’
105707	105713	105714	105714	He	1225	‘ Months ago , Ava . ’
105724	105747	105714	105714	He	1225	‘ She was the woman who turned up at Lusso . I ’ll tell you before you threaten to leave me again . ’
105754	105765	105714	105714	He	1225	‘ She was n’t worried about you , was she ? ’
105766	105777	105721	105721	his	1225	‘ Yes , probably , but she wants me too . ’
105778	105783	105784	105784	I	363	‘ Who would n’t ? ’
105793	105830	105789	105789	He	1225	‘ I ’ve made it clear , Ava . She ’s gone back to Denmark , and I slept with her months ago . I do n’t know why she ’s decided to pursue me now . ’
105882	105898	105899	105899	He	388	‘ He wants to take me away from you , like you did his wife . ’
105907	105937	105899	105899	He	388	‘ I did n’t take her away , Ava . She left of her own accord , but yes , he does want to take you away from me . ’
105938	105949	105950	105950	My	363	‘ But you were all friendly , you bought Lusso . ’
105955	105994	105995	105995	He	363	‘ It ’s just a front , Ava – on his part . He had nothing on me , nothing he could hurt me with because I did n’t care about anything . But now I have you . ’
106001	106013	105995	105995	He	363	‘ Now , he knows where to stick the knife in . ’
106176	106183	106184	106184	he	363	‘ I ’ll die loving you . ’
106197	106207	106184	106184	he	363	‘ I ca n’t let you go to Sweden . ’
106211	106215	106208	106208	I	363	‘ I know . ’
106216	106236	106237	106237	he	363	‘ And you should have let me deal with your things . I did n’t want you seeing him . ’
106241	106248	106249	106249	I	363	’m just submitting to him now . ‘
106257	106265	106252	106252	He	363	’ I feel him stiffen under me . ‘
106270	106271	106272	106272	He	363	’ ‘
106276	106281	106282	106282	He	363	’re a raving alcoholic . ’

106294	106311	106290	106292	a raving alcoholic	2587	’ I look up at him , shocked by his blasé reaction to something so detrimental . ‘

106369	106386	106387	106387	Jesse	431	’m pretty sure that Jesse ’s issue with drink would register somewhere on the alcoholic scale . ‘
106402	106411	106396	106396	Mikael	388	’ I suddenly have a horribly unpleasant thought . ‘

106451	106460	106446	106446	He	363	’re a talented designer . The fact that you ’re

106495	106519	106520	106520	I	363	’ I say quietly . If Jesse had n’t trampled my meeting with Mikael , then he might never have made the connection . ‘
106525	106529	106520	106520	I	363	’ He shrugs . ‘
106576	106617	106572	106572	he	363	’ I remember his eyes bulging , his jaw ticking when he spotted my appointment in my diary . It was n’t because I replaced the damn thing . It was because Mikael ’s name was plastered all over it . ‘

106843	106858	106842	106842	I	363	’m snapped from my unwelcome thoughts when Jesse cups my face with his hand . ‘
106865	106869	106870	106870	I	363	’ I grin . ‘
106876	106885	106870	106870	I	363	’ His eyes sparkle , his lips twitch . ‘
106899	106915	106916	106916	Jesse	431	’ I lose my grin when I consider the repair bill Jesse will be getting . ‘

106954	106973	106974	106974	I	363	’ His frown line is light across his forehead . I bury my face back in his chest . ‘

106984	106998	106974	106974	I	363	’ he says flatly , but I know he ’s suppressing a laugh . ‘
107014	107036	106974	106974	I	363	’ I ask accusingly . I could have outrun Clive , even in my heels . He strokes my hair softy . ‘

107056	107101	107102	107102	I	363	’ I pull his shirt out of his trousers and slide my hands up to get my fix of his warm chest . He tightens his hold of me , and I feel his beating heart under my palms . It ’s so comforting . ‘

107118	107137	107146	107146	lady	59	’ He kisses my temple and burrows deeply into my hair . I shake my head in dismay . ‘
107148	107163	107146	107146	lady	59	’ he says in a stern , muffled voice , which I completely ignore . ‘
107169	107170	107166	107166	your	59	’ ‘
107185	107197	107166	107166	your	59	’ he answers dryly . I wriggle free of his embrace . ‘
107202	107248	107249	107249	I	363	’ I sit up on his lap and he pulls his hand from behind me to rest between our bodies . I gingerly take it . He does n’t wince , but I flick him a quick glace to check his face is n’t pained . ‘
107250	107253	107254	107254	he	363	’m fine . ’
107258	107265	107266	107266	I	363	‘ You smashed the elevator door . ’
107302	107308	107266	107266	I	363	‘ I was really mad . ’
107309	107332	107334	107334	I	363	‘ You already told me that . What about the hijacking of my office this afternoon ? Where you crazy mad then ? ’
107355	107361	107362	107362	He	363	‘ Yes , I was , ’
107374	107383	107371	107371	he	363	‘ A bit like you were just now . ’
107384	107392	107393	107393	I	363	‘ I was n’t mad , Jesse . ’
107416	107448	107449	107449	I	363	‘ I was marking what ’s mine . She wants you . She could n’t have been more obvious if she ’d straddled you and thrust her tits in your face . ’
107514	107522	107523	107523	He	363	‘ You look very happy with yourself . ’
107533	107544	107523	107523	He	363	‘ Oh , I am . I like it when you ’re
107554	107561	107553	107553	you	1251	’re crazy in love with me . ’
107562	107582	107583	107583	I	363	‘ I am , even though you are stupidly challenging . And do n’t be calling Sarah , sweetie . ’
107597	107602	107586	107586	He	363	‘ I wo n’t . ’
107603	107610	107586	107586	He	363	‘ You ’ve slept with her . ’
107636	107640	107641	107641	I	363	‘ A dabble ? ’
107650	107653	107644	107644	His	363	‘ Yeah , ’
107723	107732	107709	107710	the woman	886	‘ I just want to say one thing . ’
107744	107764	107743	107743	I	363	’m ever going to keep company , both socially and professionally , with any men in future , although I ’m
107780	107787	107788	107788	I	363	‘ It ’s all about you . ’
107800	107807	107808	107808	he	431	‘ It ’s all about me . ’
107816	107820	107821	107821	He	431	‘ Good boy . ’
107838	107845	107832	107832	his	431	‘ Why is your hair wet ? ’
107846	107865	107866	107866	He	431	‘ I had a shower but did n’t have time to dry my hair . I needed you . ’
107870	107877	107878	107878	I	363	‘ I love you , Ava . ’
107885	107889	107890	107890	I	363	‘ I know . ’
107891	107982	107890	107890	I	363	’m not kidding myself that this is the air completely cleared . I have a woman scorned to contend with and Jesse ’s possessiveness to work on . The latter , I think , will be a lifelong bone of contention , but if Jesse , especially like this , is my compensation , then it ’s all worth it . But on top of all that , there ’s the huge issue of Mikael and his need for revenge . I ca n’t even begin to think of how we ’re
108014	108022	108023	108023	His	564	‘ Take the day off work tomorrow . ’
108065	108096	108064	108064	I	363	’m ridiculously up to date with everything else . Patrick owes me a few days in lieu . He wo n’t mind . I pull myself away from his chest . ‘
108099	108108	108064	108064	I	363	’ I agree . He frowns , like I ’m
108122	108154	108121	108121	I	363	’m not . I want to take the day off work and spend it with him . Maybe I can pump him full of the re - assurance he needs . I ’m
108179	108182	108183	108183	His	564	‘ Really ? ’
108194	108196	108183	108183	His	564	‘ You ’re
108207	108237	108238	108238	I	363	’ My eyes bulge at his comment . I know he knows that he ’s the unreasonable one . He ’s playing on it . I do n’t bite . ‘
108239	108243	108244	108244	I	363	’m ignoring you . ’
108247	108253	108244	108244	I	363	‘ Not for long . I ’m
108275	108285	108287	108287	we	1259	’ He stands and props me on my feet . ‘
108289	108315	108316	108316	I	363	’ He cocks his arm out and I link it with mine , my stomach clenching at the prospects awaiting me when we get home . ‘
108323	108336	108316	108316	I	363	’ I flip casually . He raises a sardonic eyebrow at me . ‘
108351	108412	108345	108345	I	363	’ he says softly , looking down at me . I smile . He leads me through the summer room and to the entrance hall . I ignore the disappointed faces of all of the women we pass , all obviously hoping we would be leaving separately . John meets us at the door and gives me his distinguished smile . ‘
108419	108431	108345	108345	I	363	’ Jesse informs him as he opens the door for me . ‘
108435	108572	108574	108574	myself	363	’ He slaps Jesse on the shoulder and walks off in the direction of the bar . Jesse places his hand in the small of my back to guide me out and as I turn , I catch a glimpse of Sarah standing in the doorway of the bar . She greets John , but her eyes are fixed firmly on me and Jesse leaving The Manor . She is watching intently and there is no mistaking the look of bitterness on her pouty face . I predict handbags at dawn . She looks like a woman who gets what she wants . My bitchy side races to the surface , and I silently dare her to try , tossing her a warning look . I ignore the little part of my brain advising me that I ’m
108589	108600	108601	108601	he	1262	‘ Leave your car , we ’ll get it tomorrow . ’
108614	108624	108625	108625	I	363	‘ I may as well drive it back now . ’
108626	108719	108625	108625	I	363	’m here , it would be silly not to . He narrows his eyes on me and thrusts his hand towards the passenger seat of his car . I shake my head , but get in . We ’ve had enough words for today . I do n’t need my car , anyway . He slips in besides me and starts the car . As we make our way down the long driveway , we pass Sam ’s Porsche on its way towards The Manor . I bolt upright in my seat . ‘
108726	108761	108724	108724	Kate	431	’ I blurt . Sam honks his horn and puts his thumb up to Jesse , and I crane my neck as we pass them . Kate puts a reluctant hand up to me . ‘
108768	108787	108788	108788	She	1264	’ I look at Jesse , who keeps his eyes on the road . Oh , good God ! ‘
108797	108802	108795	108795	she	1264	’ I ask accusingly . ‘
108811	108817	108819	108819	she	1264	’ He ’s dead pan . ‘
108824	108924	108819	108819	she	1264	’ I shriek . I do n’t believe this . He shrugs and presses a button to open the gates . The little minx ! Why has n’t she told me ? Is she here for all things kinky in general , or is she here for Sam specifically ? Christ , just when I thought my fiery , red headed friend could n’t surprise me more . Oh , she has some explaining to do . Jesse roars off down the road and plays with a few buttons on the steering wheel . The stereo kicks in and I ’m
108936	108941	108942	108942	I	363	‘ Who ’s this ? ’
108952	108959	108945	108945	He	363	‘ John Legend . You like ? ’
108997	109006	109007	109007	He	431	‘ I ’ll take that as a yes . ’
109026	109032	109033	109033	I	363	‘ Yes , I do . ’
109036	109042	109033	109033	I	363	‘ Is your hand okay ? ’
109043	109052	109007	109007	He	431	‘ Fine , unravel your knickers , lady . ’
109053	109060	109033	109033	I	363	‘ I need to text Patrick . ’
109061	109067	109033	109033	I	363	‘ Yes , do . I ’m
109081	109160	109161	109162	Mr Ward	340	’ He removes his hand from my knee and replaces it on the steering wheel . I fire a quick text over to Patrick and , as expected , he replies speedily , telling me to have a well - deserved day off . Perfect . Chapter 16 We stroll into Lusso hand in hand , and Clive clocks us immediately , giving me a disapproving look . I smile an apology and notice maintenance repairing my handiwork . ‘
109164	109209	109210	109210	Clive	76	’ Clive says cautiously . Is he waiting for a ticking off for letting me escape ? I think I might be forced to defend him if Jesse tries to reprimand him . It ’s not in his job description to play prison guard . ‘
109212	109236	109210	109210	Clive	76	’ Jesse nods and leads me to the elevator without another word to an obviously apprehensive Clive . As the doors close , I ’m

109299	109306	109307	109307	he	76	‘ You ’ve upset the concierge . ’
109328	109331	109332	109332	I	363	‘ Damn . ’
109394	109403	109404	109404	he	76	‘ Why are n’t you wearing a dress ? ’
109418	109441	109442	109442	I	363	’m asking myself the very same question . It would be around my waist by now and he would be inside me . ‘
109443	109449	109450	109450	I	363	’m running out of dresses . ’
109477	109485	109471	109471	He	76	‘ Tomorrow , we buy only dresses . ’
109510	109517	109502	109502	I	363	‘ Tomorrow we buy one dress . ’
109615	109618	109619	109619	he	76	‘ Mouth . ’
109624	109638	109623	109623	I	363	’m totally on board . I ca n’t get enough of him . I ’m
109669	109696	109668	109668	I	363	’m never more relieved that it ’s the only lift that comes up to the top floor . I slide my back down the wall until I ’m
109777	109784	109785	109785	he	76	‘ What are you waiting for ? ’
109951	109958	109959	109959	he	76	‘ All the way , Ava . ’
109963	110221	109962	109962	I	363	’m aware of the door on the elevator closing again and then Jesse reaching over , slamming his fist against the button before returning his hand to the wall behind me . Wrapping my lips around his head , I circle my tongue slowly , delicately . He shudders . I love doing this to him . I love instigating these sounds from his mouth , the reactions from his body . I wait for his surge forward , but it does n’t come . He ’s struggling . I can feel his tenseness seeping into my body from our contact ; I can see his hips shaking slightly in front of me . I put him out of his misery and take him deep into my mouth until he hits the back of my throat . He feels like velvet on my tongue . He lets out a suppressed bark as I pull back , lap slowly and take him again . This time , his hips surge forward and with my head against the wall , there is no retreating space . He moves his hands to cup the back of my head , padding me as he powers forward on a shout , throwing his head back and driving in and out of my mouth purposefully . I remember to relax , my gag reflex working hard not to wretch . I let my hands drift around his hips to find his tight arse , and then bury my fingernails into his toned flesh . ‘
110224	110237	109962	109962	I	363	’ His voice is severe and animalistic . I dig in harder . ‘
110242	110281	109962	109962	I	363	’ He continues with his drives , and I know he ’s close . I prize one hand off a cheek and reach between his thighs to wrap my fist around his balls . It ’s his undoing . ‘
110285	110300	109962	109962	I	363	’ he yelps , pulling out to wrap his own fist around the base . ‘
110308	110319	109962	109962	I	363	’ His eyes drill into me . I do what I ’m
110457	110472	110473	110473	His	363	‘ I want one of those every day for the rest of my life . ’
110492	110496	110497	110497	he	363	‘ From you . ’
110560	110564	110565	110565	He	363	‘ Come here . ’
110576	110585	110586	110586	he	363	‘ I love you and your filthy mouth . ’
110597	110603	110590	110590	he	363	‘ I know you do . ’
110642	110663	110664	110664	He	363	‘ That was a complete waste of time . They ’ll be off as soon as I get you inside . ’
110678	110683	110664	110664	He	363	‘ Oh , dinner ! ’
110746	110762	110728	110728	He	363	‘ I employ a housekeeper and a cook and you still manage to burn dinner . ’
110810	110815	110817	110817	she	1280	’m a total bitch . ‘
110821	110829	110817	110817	she	1280	’ I ask guiltily . He laughs . ‘
110834	110845	110830	110830	I	363	’ He pokes the crusty top layer of the lasagna . ‘
110852	110861	110846	110846	Cathy	90	’ He focuses his eyes back on me . ‘
110875	110956	110865	110865	I	363	’ He pushes the lasagna away from him and slowly stalks towards me , his hungry , green eyes full of promise and pleasure . He does n’t slow his pace as he nears me . He wraps his arm around my back and carries on walking with me held tight against his chest . I reach up and fan my fingers through his soft , messy mop and frown when he bypasses the stairs , heading for the terrace . ‘
110962	110972	110865	110865	I	363	’ I ask as I watch the stairs pass . ‘
110977	110985	110865	110865	I	363	’ He pushes his lips to mine . ‘
110998	111030	111036	111036	he	363	’ He carries me onto the terrace and across the limestone slabs to the raised decking area , the sounds of London by night clear in the cool evening air . I ’m
111119	111123	111124	111124	he	363	‘ Show off . ’
111176	111182	111183	111183	he	363	‘ Where ’s the zipper ? ’
111233	111241	111242	111242	he	363	‘ Yet another reason for dresses only . ’
111253	111267	111245	111245	he	363	‘ Anything that stops me from getting to you fast has to go . ’
111329	111332	111333	111333	he	363	‘ Lace . ’
111472	111475	111476	111476	he	363	‘ Wet . ’
111509	111514	111504	111504	he	363	‘ Just for me ? ’
111526	111531	111532	111532	I	363	‘ Just for you . ’
111782	111788	111769	111769	he	363	‘ You are my life . ’
111839	111845	111835	111835	He	363	‘ Do you love me ? ’
111854	111860	111861	111861	I	363	‘ You know I do . ’
111864	111874	111875	111875	His	363	‘ Say it . I need to hear it . ’
111887	111892	111882	111882	I	363	‘ I love you . ’
111920	111927	111928	111928	I	363	‘ I ’ll always love you . ’

112078	112086	112061	112061	He	363	‘ Feel how perfect we are together ? ’
112114	112120	112121	112121	he	363	‘ Do you feel it ? ’
112136	112140	112141	112141	I	363	‘ I do . ’
112202	112211	112194	112194	He	363	‘ Me too . Let ’s make love . ’
112345	112352	112337	112337	he	363	‘ Oh , God , Ava . ’
112388	112397	112398	112398	I	363	‘ I ca n’t hold onto it anymore . ’
112401	112404	112405	112405	he	363	‘ Together . ’

112452	112489	112492	112492	Jesus	155	’ I whimper , feeling my self - control pang and dissipate . I shatter underneath him on a loud cry . He quickens his last few drives , sending him over the edge with me . ‘
112494	112532	112492	112492	Jesus	155	’ he yells , thrusting one last time and holding himself deep inside me before collapsing on top of me to join me in my aftermath . His erection jumps and jacks as he comes inside me . ‘
112535	112558	112533	112533	Fuckkkkkkkkk	163	’ I muse quietly , my eyes closing in relaxed satisfaction . This man has a direct link to my release switch . ‘
112561	112571	112533	112533	Fuckkkkkkkkk	163	’ he murmurs into my neck through exhausted breaths . ‘
112581	112582	112583	112583	I	363	’ ‘
112594	112680	112681	112681	Ouch	164	’ I defend myself and trail the word fuck across his back with my fingertip . He pushes himself up on his elbow , slipping out of me so he can look down into my eyes . Then he takes his finger and slowly trails the word mouth across my breasts before dropping a kiss on each nipple . I grin when he flicks his eyes up to me . They are dancing with mischief as he clamps his teeth lightly on my tight bud . ‘
112683	112736	112737	112737	You	164	’ I laugh . He releases and laps a wet circle around my breast and then grabs my hip . I jump under him on a yelp as he clamps his teeth back down over my nipple . My body stills in a heartbeat as I catch on to his game immediately . ‘
112741	112788	112789	112789	Jesse	431	’ I cry , as he slowly starts massaging my hip with the tips of his fingers while he remains locked onto my nipple . I clench my eyes shut and wiggle my feet to try and prevent the reflex reaction of bucking him off me . ‘
112794	112809	112789	112789	Jesse	431	’ I hear him chuckle and increase the pressure on my hip and nipple . ‘
112812	112895	112789	112789	Jesse	431	’ I squeal through a giggle . My nipple would probably hurt if I was n’t being distracted by the unbearable hip torture . He ’s driving me insane ! My lungs scream a thank you as I release a rush of air and muster up the strength to blank out his torture . I still under him and after what seems like forever , he eases off my hipbone and starts sucking the life back into my nipple . I sigh . ‘
112906	112913	112914	112914	Ava	0	’ He grabs my hip again . ‘
112916	112947	112948	112948	You	431	’ he scorns me tiredly before returning his attention to my breasts . I heave a huge contented exhale and close my eyes while Jesse lavishes me with his tongue . ‘
112949	112952	112953	112953	he	431	’re shivering . ’
112959	112966	112967	112967	He	431	‘ Let me get you inside . ’
112992	112995	112985	112985	He	431	‘ Comfy ? ’
112996	112999	113000	113000	I	363	‘ Hmmm , ’
113005	113008	113009	113009	He	431	‘ Bed . ’
113021	113027	113009	113009	He	431	‘ You need to eat . ’
113075	113077	113063	113063	He	431	‘ I ’m

113108	113112	113124	113124	I	363	‘ I promise . ’
113113	113123	113124	113124	I	363	‘ Okay , take me to bed , God . ’
113139	113298	113299	113299	Ava	0	’m lowered into bed and as soon as Jesse slips in besides me , I crawl onto his chest . He kisses my hair before smoothing his palm up and down my back . I shift closer to him ; I ca n’t get near enough . As always , there is no space welcome between us . Chapter 17 I wake up with Jesse buried deep inside me , his chest to my back as he holds my waist and pumps forward . My brain is not the only thing woken up . My body jumps to attention and I reach back and curl my fingers into his hair , arching my back and tilting my head back to find his lips . I let him take my mouth , our tongues delving wildly as he pistons forward . I push myself back onto him with each surge , every one cranking me up further and further . ‘
113309	113316	113299	113299	Ava	0	’ he gasps against my mouth . ‘
113324	113328	113329	113329	I	363	’ As if ! ‘
113333	113375	113329	113329	I	363	’ I fist my hands in his hair and yank his lips back down to mine . I love his mouth , even when he ’s being challenging and I want to sew it shut . He needs constant reassurance that I ’m
113442	113448	113433	113433	He	1288	‘ Please , believe me . ’
113543	113623	113628	113628	God	81	’m yanked back onto him repeatedly . The coil snaps and I jerk as we both yell at the same time and he charges forward manically , throwing me into a bottomless abyss of utter pleasure . I try and catch my breath , my heart fighting to gain control and my body convulsing of its own accord . Jesse swears and bucks forward one last frenzied time , and then the warm sensation of his release floods me . ‘
113630	113669	113628	113628	God	81	’ he puffs , slipping out of me and falling onto his back . I roll over and climb onto his body , straddling his hips and laying on his chest , nuzzling my face in his neck . ‘
113676	113691	113628	113628	God	81	’ I declare into his neck then press my lips to his throbbing vein . ‘
113694	113698	113628	113628	God	81	’ he pants . ‘
113707	113729	113628	113628	God	81	’ I wince , immediately realising that I ’ve just swore and we have n’t even got out of bed yet . ‘
113740	113766	113735	113735	Ava	0	’ he grates with one hundred percent frustration . I need to sort my mouth out , I never usually swear , it ’s him ! ‘
113769	113779	113735	113735	Ava	0	’ I bite his neck and suck a little . ‘
113787	113798	113735	113735	Ava	0	’ he asks , but he does n’t stop me . ‘
113804	113824	113735	113735	Ava	0	’ He turns his face into me and finds my lips , wrapping his big arms around my back . ‘
113827	113829	113832	113832	I	363	’ I ’m
113840	113858	113839	113839	I	363	’m comfy where I am . I peck his lips and slide myself down his body until I ’m
113865	113867	113839	113839	I	363	‘ I ’m
113870	113892	113893	113893	I	363	’ I trail a path down his chest to his scar , tracing the length of his wound back and forth . ‘
113899	113921	113897	113897	lady	363	’ He pulls his knee up into a bent position and lets me have my way . It ’s a novelty . ‘

113932	113994	113930	113930	you	363	’ he asks uncertainly . His question throws me . Of course I do . He tells me all of the time and if it ’s as much as I love him , then it ’s a lot . Immeasurable , in fact . Please do n’t tell me that he doubts me here too . I look up at him . ‘
114000	114032	113997	113997	I	363	’ He reaches down and pulls me up his body and then flips me onto my back , pinning me under him with my wrists in his grasp above my head . ‘
114041	114058	113997	113997	I	363	’ His eyes burn into mine , his face serious . Where has this come from ? ‘
114069	114091	114059	114059	You	59	’ I try and free my wrists so I can hold his face , but he refuses to let me go . ‘
114100	114106	114098	114098	Ava	0	’ He ’s so serious . ‘
114118	114171	114098	114098	Ava	0	’ I ask , in an attempt to lighten him up . I do n’t like how downhearted he looks . I wish he would n’t worry about me leaving , me loving him , and wondering if I know how much he loves me . All those ships have long sailed . ‘
114198	114216	114187	114187	I	363	’ He ’s almost scowling at me , like he ’s mad that he feels this way . ‘
114240	114245	114246	114246	He	363	’m aware of that . ’
114254	114264	114246	114246	He	363	‘ I drive you insane , do n’t I ? ’
114278	114286	114287	114289	my challenging man	58	‘ You are very challenging , but you ’re
114297	114302	114296	114296	you	59	’re worth the frustration . ’
114303	114305	114310	114310	lady	59	‘ You ’re
114312	114321	114322	114322	Me	363	’ he says dryly . My eyes bulge . ‘
114324	114332	114322	114322	Me	363	’ The man is a bloody nutcase ! ‘
114349	114402	114340	114340	you	59	’ I want to … well , challenge him . No sooner has he given me what I want – an admission – he tramples it with his own accusations . Me ? Challenging ? I start to make my case , but he hushes me with his lush lips , and I ’m
114453	114468	114448	114448	He	1294	‘ I knew you were the one the second I laid eyes on you . ’
114469	114473	114474	114474	I	363	‘ The one ? ’
114475	114505	114448	114448	He	1294	’m intrigued . His persistence and insistence that I belonged with him at the beginning of our relationship has always been confusing to me . He nuzzles my ear . ‘
114515	114544	114448	114448	He	1294	’ he says in that matter - of - fact tone – the one that basically means he is saying something only he understands . Was he dead ? ‘
114550	114580	114448	114448	He	1294	’ He ’s talking . I need to extract as much from him as possible . He looks me straight in the eyes . They are bursting with meaning . ‘
114588	114617	114448	114448	He	1294	’ he whispers . A lump jumps into my throat as I look up , completely stunned by his admission . That is some serious deep , and I ’m
114644	114758	114643	114643	I	363	’m the only thing that exists . I pull at his grip on my wrists until he lets go and throw my arms around his body , my legs around his waist , holding onto him like he is the only thing that exists . He is , for me . I do n’t know the why s and wherefores of that statement , but the power of those words really does say it all . He ca n’t live without me . Well , I could n’t live without him either . This man is my world . He lays still over me and lets me squeeze him until my muscles ache . ‘
114764	114801	114802	114802	I	363	’ I ask when my thigh muscles start to scream in protest . He lifts me from the bed , still coiled around his body , and carries me from the bedroom , down the stairs . ‘
114803	114813	114814	114814	I	363	’m going to forget how to use my legs . ’
114827	114835	114817	114817	he	363	‘ Then I ’ll carry you everywhere . ’
114836	114846	114817	114817	he	363	‘ You would like that , would n’t you ? ’
114862	114868	114869	114869	He	363	‘ I would love it . ’
114891	114930	114931	114931	I	363	’re both stark , bollock naked . I admire his perfect arse as he walks over to the fridge and collects an assortment of breakfast things and a jar of peanut butter . I slide off the island . ‘
114932	114940	114941	114941	I	363	’m supposed to be making you breakfast . ’
114949	114952	114953	114953	I	363	‘ Sit . ’
114983	114989	114990	114990	I	363	‘ What do you want ? ’
115012	115016	115017	115017	he	363	‘ Fried eggs . ’
115071	115082	115058	115058	he	363	‘ I ’ll cook yours , if you cook mine . ’
115102	115105	115096	115096	He	363	‘ Savage . ’
115188	115192	115187	115187	I	363	’m panicking now . ‘
115196	115206	115187	115187	I	363	’ He looks at me , all wide eyed . ‘

115334	115337	115320	115320	I	363	‘ Shit ! ’
115347	115352	115353	115353	I	363	‘ Ouch ouch ouch ! ’
115379	115382	115383	115383	he	431	‘ Mouth ! ’
115390	115394	115383	115383	he	431	‘ Goodness gracious ! ’
115429	115453	115428	115428	I	363	’m mortified . I ’ll never be able to look her in the eye again . I feel Jesse land on the bed . ‘
115458	115478	115428	115428	I	363	’ He works his way through the covers until he locates me with my head buried in the pillow . ‘
115483	115496	115428	115428	I	363	’ He flips me over and submerges his face in my breasts . ‘

I hold my breath and reposition my arms so my palms are flat on my burning red face , but all embarrassment is momentarily eliminated when I feel the warm wetness of his tongue dragging up my instep , licking the trail of blood away . I shiver under his tongue ’s stroke and remove my hands to look down at him , shifting a little , my thighs tightening . He smiles knowingly , his eyes sparkling , before he wraps his lips around the offending shard . ‘

116746	116787	116745	116745	I	363	’m in my element . This has never happened . He must have a lot of respect for Cathy because I know for sure that with anyone else , I would have been hauled out of the kitchen by now . ‘

I do n’t know what Cathy does , or what he wants her to do today , and I have absolutely no intention of following him upstairs to finish what I ’ve started .

He was sorry before and it ’s still bothering me how he knows about Jesse . I should ring my Mum first , but I have a friend with some explaining to do . She takes a while , but she eventually answers . I know she ’ll be looking down at her screen , wondering what to say . ‘

I ’ve never been her favourite person and she ’s never been mine . Her little golden boy can do no wrong , so calling her and filling her in on Matt ’s transgressions would be fruitless . Oh God , my parents will be frantic . I close my eyes and try to dispel all thoughts of hideous ex - boyfriends and worrying parents . It does n’t work .

120006	120014	120015	120015	He	1355	‘ Ours ! For fuck sake woman ! ’

I have the urgent need to cleanse my soul . I laugh inwardly . A few apologies to the staff of Lusso is n’t going to cut it , and now Clive knows about the elevator door , I expect he ’s even more cross with me . I spot him collecting the post from the mailboxes . ‘
120158	120181	120182	120182	Ava	0	’ I say cheerfully . He looks up as he locks the mailbox . There is no escaping his grievance with me . ‘
120184	120202	120203	120203	Clive	76	’ he replies with no friendliness . It ’s beyond formal . I ’ve really upset him . ‘
120206	120210	120203	120203	Clive	76	’m so sorry . ’
120211	120218	120219	120219	He	76	‘ You caused me untold inconvenience . ’

120360	120382	120383	120383	I	363	’ are a sucker for a good whiskey . He glances up from the post he is sorting out . Bingo ! ‘

120402	120410	120411	120411	I	363	’ I say , and he smiles . ‘
120426	120441	120417	120417	I	363	’ I do know what got into me ; Jesse Ward got into me . ‘
120451	120460	120463	120463	Clive	76	’ He hands me a couple of envelopes . ‘

120630	120645	120646	120646	My	363	‘ Do you not find it strange that you do n’t know those things ? ’
120678	120683	120670	120670	He	106	‘ Your point being ? ’
120684	120698	120699	120699	I	363	‘ My point is that we do n’t know much about each other . ’

120734	120738	120731	120731	I	363	‘ Smoked salmon . ’

120851	120866	120850	120850	I	363	’m not walking and I do n’t do public transport , so yes , we ’re
120888	120914	120850	120850	I	363	’ I think I just about disguise my inward groan . Great , I get a day off work to spend with Jesse , and I ’m

121072	121084	121085	121085	I	363	‘ I was just thinking about how much I love you . ’
121103	121109	121110	121110	He	431	‘ I know you do , ’
121119	121126	121110	121110	He	431	‘ Where am I heading then ? ’

121177	121188	121175	121175	him	431	‘ Is n’t there just one shop you go to ? ’
121196	121210	121193	121193	He	431	’m going to find a dress in the first shop I walk in ? ‘

121239	121297	121236	121236	I	363	’ he says , stunned at my intention to drag him around more than one shop . I ca n’t imagine Jesse shopping for clothes . Men ’s shopping is a lot simpler than women ’s . If he ’s expecting a similar experience to when he goes shopping , then he ’s in for a shock . ‘
121303	121307	121308	121308	Harrods	168	’ I ask . ‘

121407	121419	121399	121399	Jesse	431	’ I remind him . He shrugs , completely ignoring me . ‘
121423	121427	121399	121399	Jesse	431	’ I affirm . ‘
121432	121512	121399	121399	Jesse	431	’ he says to himself . Oh no ! He is not buying my clothes . I ’ve had one shopping experience with him , and he nearly had an epileptic fit over the length of my dress . Yes , I only bought the stupidly expensive thing in a childish revenge fit , but the point is ; he thought he could dictate what I wear . He wants to buy my clothes so he can choose them . ‘
121520	121543	121544	121544	I	363	’ I say with all the disgust I truly feel . He looks at me like I ’ve just grown another head . ‘
121548	121549	121552	121552	you	1373	’ ‘
121553	121556	121552	121552	you	1373	’re not . ’
121557	121570	121571	121571	He	363	‘ Ava , this is not up for discussion . End of . ’
121582	121586	121571	121571	He	363	‘ No , you ’re
121599	121612	121593	121593	I	363	’ I turn Oasis up to drown out any counter attack . I ’m
121710	121718	121719	121719	he	363	‘ I have a proposition for you . ’

121770	121803	121806	121806	You	1378	’ I say smugly , getting out of the car . Jesse jumps out and walks around the car to join me on the pavement . He narrows his eyes on me . ‘
121814	121815	121817	121817	I	363	’ ‘
121819	121820	121817	121817	I	363	’ ‘
121831	121846	121817	121817	I	363	’ he reminds me . I knew I would n’t get away with it . ‘
121856	121862	121863	121863	I	363	’re not buying my clothes . ’
121885	121894	121895	121895	he	431	‘ You ’ve not even heard me out , ’
121898	121904	121895	121895	he	431	‘ You ’ll like what I ’m
121909	121921	121895	121895	he	431	’ He grins . His confident persona is back , and I ’m
121943	121946	121935	121935	He	431	‘ What ? ’
121965	121972	121959	121959	His	431	‘ You let me spoil you , ’
121990	122001	122002	122002	He	431	‘ And I will tell you how old I am . ’
122042	122080	122081	122081	I	363	’m completely and utterly taken by this man , who lays one finger on me and renders me easy . He moans into my mouth as he tips me back , holding me suspended in his arms . ‘
122088	122104	122081	122081	I	363	’ I say against his lips . He pulls back and gazes down at me . ‘
122108	122114	122115	122115	You	1380	’ I gape at him . ‘
122118	122138	122115	122115	You	1380	’ He ’s not thirty seven ? How old is he then ? Bloody hell , is he older ? ‘
122142	122149	122115	122115	You	1380	’ I demand on a scowl . ‘
122175	122186	122187	122187	I	363	’ He grins and returns me to a standing position . ‘
122191	122198	122187	122187	I	363	’ I scoff . I will ! ‘
122208	122216	122187	122187	I	363	’ He gives me an inquiring eye . ‘
122228	122283	122217	122217	I	363	’ No , I ca n’t believe I did that either , but it seems the whole episode was fruitless , after all . He takes my hand and leads me across the road and into the store . Chapter 18 My eyes are immediately blessed with masses of drool worthy handbags , but I ’m
122327	122336	122321	122321	I	363	‘ Hey , I want the fourth floor . ’
122360	122363	122355	122355	he	363	‘ Jesse ? ’
122391	122397	122390	122390	I	363	’m pulled out behind him . ‘
122401	122419	122421	122421	he	363	’ he says , pulling me through the incredible displays of designer clothes and couture gowns . I ’m
122441	122450	122455	122455	him	363	‘ No , Jesse , no no no , ’
122471	122476	122458	122458	he	363	‘ Jesse , please . ’
122545	122553	122554	122554	he	363	‘ I have an appointment with Zoe . ’
122588	122592	122593	122594	The assistant	1392	‘ Mr Ward ? ’
122597	122600	122601	122601	Jesse	431	‘ Yes . ’
122618	122625	122617	122617	I	363	’m scowling heavily at him and I ’m
122631	122648	122649	122649	he	363	‘ Please , this way . Can I get you any drinks ? Champagne , perhaps ? ’
122692	122698	122699	122699	Jesse	431	‘ No , thank you . ’
122746	122751	122752	122752	he	1393	‘ What ’s up ? ’
122770	122789	122790	122790	He	1393	‘ Why did you ask me where I wanted to go if you ’d already made an appointment ? ’
122793	122818	122790	122790	He	1393	‘ I do n’t understand why you would want to trail around a dozen stores when you can have everything brought to you here . ’
122835	122842	122843	122843	I	363	‘ Is this how you shop ? ’
122855	122862	122854	122854	I	363	’m getting sweatier by the second . ‘
122879	122925	122926	122926	Jesse	431	’ he says shortly . I look at him , completely stunned , but before I have a chance to retaliate , a young blonde haired girl appears and beams at Jesse . She ’s pretty and kitted out in a Ralph Lauren cream suit . ‘
122928	122934	122926	122926	Jesse	431	’ she sings at him . ‘
122965	122969	122961	122961	he	1393	‘ Zoe . I ’m
122974	123003	122972	122972	You	363	’ He smiles at her . It ’s one of them knock out smiles – the one that reduces women to a mass of hormones at his feet . ‘
123019	123047	123053	123053	She	0	’ She puts her hand out to me , and I stand to take it , offering a small smile . She ’s friendly enough , but I ’m
123061	123070	123053	123053	She	0	‘ So , Ava , Jesse tells me we ’re
123080	123100	123053	123053	She	0	’ she says excitedly . Something special sounds like it ’s going to have a special price tag too . ‘
123105	123123	123127	123127	I	363	’ Jesse reiterates as he pulls be back down to the couch . I suddenly feel like I ’m
123128	123136	123127	123127	I	363	’m all claustrophobic in this massive room . ‘
123155	123200	123144	123144	Ava	0	’ She places her hands in her lap and looks at me expectedly . I do n’t know what my style is . If I like something and I feel good in it , I buy it . I ca n’t categorise my style . ‘
123209	123227	123144	123144	Ava	0	’ I shrug , and her eyes light up . That must have been a good answer . ‘
123232	123236	123237	123237	She	0	’ Jesse interrupts . ‘
123241	123242	123243	123243	You	363	’ ‘
123247	123273	123274	123274	You	363	’ I mutter , earning myself a nudge of his knee . She smiles , revealing a perfect set of Hollywood , too white teeth . ‘
123275	123282	123274	123274	You	363	’re about a ten , yes ? ’
123283	123286	123287	123287	I	363	‘ Yes . ’
123290	123295	123296	123296	Jesse	431	‘ Not too short . ’
123318	123341	123342	123342	Jesse	431	’m not generally a short dress person , but he ’s turning me into one with his caveman attitude . Zoe laughs . ‘
123366	123371	123372	123372	I	363	’ I like her . ‘
123373	123377	123372	123372	I	363	’m a five . ’
123378	123385	123386	123386	She	0	‘ Great , let ’s go . ’
123399	123411	123394	123394	Jesse	431	‘ I ca n’t believe you ’ve done this to me . ’
123444	123453	123441	123441	He	431	‘ Ava , let me have my fun , ’
123461	123475	123476	123476	He	431	‘ I get my own little fashion show with my favourite lady modeling . ’
123479	123489	123490	123490	He	431	‘ Who gets to pick the dress , Jesse ? ’
123495	123500	123490	123490	He	431	‘ You do . I ’m
123514	123529	123511	123511	yourself	1400	’ He sits back down on the sofa and starts making a call . I ’m
123562	123566	123555	123555	Zoe	169	‘ So , you ’re
123571	123591	123592	123592	I	363	’ she asks on a friendly smile . She is lovely , but those teeth are really very white . ‘
123598	123604	123592	123592	I	363	’ I return her smile . ‘
123613	123655	123592	123592	I	363	’ she laughs , picking up a long , green gown and presenting it to me . It ’s lovely but more Kate ’s colour than mine . I give a little apologetic shake of my head . She mirrors it . ‘
123666	123678	123592	123592	I	363	’ She places a hand on a lovely Grecian style dress . ‘
123683	123694	123592	123592	I	363	’ I admit , but it also looks very expensive . ‘
123707	123708	123592	123592	I	363	’ ‘
123711	123729	123730	123730	Jesse	431	’ I blurt at the cream , tight number with a thigh high slash up the leg . ‘
123739	123757	123758	123758	He	431	’ I laugh as I hold the split open . You would have to shave everything off ! ‘
123761	123772	123773	123773	He	431	’ She looks at me curiously . If she says … ‘
123778	123801	123773	123773	He	431	’ she adds . No , he ’s not ! I release the dress and move on to a red satin one . ‘
123806	123810	123811	123811	I	363	’ I mutter . ‘
123816	123826	123811	123811	I	363	’ Zoe replaces her curious stare with a smile . ‘
123834	123853	123870	123870	he	431	’ She walks across the way and strokes a stunning cream , strapless affair . Is strapless allowed ? ‘
123858	123868	123870	123870	he	431	’ I agree . I can try it . I ’m
123892	123923	123891	123891	I	363	’m wandering over before I realise my legs are moving . I run my finger lightly down the front of the black , delicate lace gown . It ’s beautiful . ‘
123931	123966	123924	123924	You	1407	’ Zoe says , joining me in front of the gown . She takes it down and turns it gently . It ’s attached to a security wire which can only mean one thing . ‘
123972	124079	124080	124080	Jesse	431	’ she asks dreamily . Oh it is . It is also in the realms of ridiculously expensive if the store feels the need to wire it up . There is also no price on the tag – another tell - tale sign that I ’ll pass out at the price . I run my eyes down the back of the fitted dress that splays mid - thigh to pool the floor slightly . The design is simple , with a plunged V shaped back , dainty capped sleeves that fall slightly off the shoulder , and a flattering deep neckline . It absolutely screams couture . ‘
124086	124098	124080	124080	Jesse	431	’ I muse quietly . He also loves me in black . ‘
124105	124112	124080	124080	Jesse	431	’ Zoe hangs it back up . ‘
124121	124179	124119	124119	Jesse	431	’ she asks casually . The question instantly puts me on guard . What do I say ? The truth is , I ’ve been seeing him for a month - ish and a week of that was spent with Jesse drunk and me nursing a broken heart . A sudden nasty thought invades my mushy brain . ‘

124211	124228	124229	124229	God	81	’ She actually starts laughing . I do n’t know if that ’s a good thing . ‘
124238	124257	124258	124258	Ava	0	’ It ’s definitely a bad thing . She must catch my expression because she pales a little . ‘

124278	124296	124297	124297	She	0	‘ What I meant to say was if he brought all of the women he had slept … ’

124345	124385	124340	124340	he	431	‘ Ava , he ’s never actually dated anyone . As far as I know , anyway . He ’s quite a catch . You ’ll be fighting the women of The Manor off , that ’s for sure . ’
124386	124389	124390	124390	I	363	‘ Yeah , ’
124428	124433	124434	124434	I	363	‘ Where to next ? ’
124453	124474	124452	124452	I	363	’m bubbling on the inside and bristling on the out . Why did he have to be such a slut ? ‘
124477	124535	124452	124452	I	363	’ Zoe sings , leading me off towards the Egyptian elevators . An hour later , we return to the plush personal shopping area with a young guy pulling a rail of dresses and shoes . Jesse is still sat on the sofa with his phone to his ear . He smiles brightly and disconnects the call . ‘
124539	124554	124555	124555	I	363	’ he asks as he gets up and smoothers my face with his lips . ‘

124568	124581	124555	124555	I	363	’ I laugh and grip his shoulders as he pushes me back . ‘

124595	124604	124555	124555	I	363	’ He brings me back up to vertical . ‘
124611	124640	124555	124555	I	363	’ I say . I managed to convince Zoe to abandon the lace gown . In fact , I avoided anything that was attached to a security wire . ‘
124644	124682	124555	124555	I	363	’ He slaps my bum , and I turn to follow Zoe and the rail into a large fitting room . Zoe ’s admiring face does n’t escape my notice . For the next few hours , I ’m
124723	124774	124775	124775	I	363	’m going to choose . They are all too nice . My head jumps up when she walks back in with another rail of dresses , but these ones are more day dresses and evening dresses , not gowns . I look at her , completely confused . She shrugs . ‘
124776	124793	124794	124794	she	169	’m under strict orders to make you try lots of dresses , so I got these , ’

124823	124826	124827	124827	I	363	‘ What ? ’
124837	124847	124836	124836	I	363	’m in my underwear and gaping like a goldfish . ‘
124850	124856	124857	124857	He	1412	’ She starts towards me , ‘

124951	124961	124896	124896	Zoe	169	’ She hangs the dress on the wall hook . ‘
124972	124982	124896	124896	Zoe	169	’ I ask hesitantly . She turns and grins . ‘
124992	125002	124896	124896	Zoe	169	’ I groan and collapse back into the chair . ‘

125121	125131	125120	125120	I	363	’m sorry . That was so unprofessional of me . ’
125219	125224	125225	125225	she	169	‘ Put these on . ’
125269	125279	125280	125280	she	169	‘ Ava , you have to have this dress . ’

125293	125296	125297	125297	I	363	‘ No ! ’
125301	125311	125297	125297	I	363	‘ Sorry , I know he ’ll love it . ’
125418	125424	125408	125408	I	363	‘ Did he see it ? ’
125438	125454	125455	125455	I	363	‘ This dress , did he see it on the rail when you came back ? ’
125458	125470	125471	125471	she	169	‘ No , I think he ’s gone to the gents . ’
125492	125496	125474	125474	I	363	‘ Okay , I ’m

125619	125661	125618	125618	I	363	’m having three maximum and he better not argue with me . I work off a million calories getting myself in and out of dozens of dresses . We build up a like , no and a maybe pile , and I ’m
125665	125690	125691	125691	She	169	’m enjoying myself . Jesse sprawls back on the sofa and watches as I appear and disappear , wearing a different dress each time . ‘
125702	125759	125700	125700	she	169	’ Zoe muses to Jesse when I appear in a very short , Chloe , grey dress . I love it , but like all of the other dresses that have a price tag of over three hundred pounds , it will go on the no pile . I watch as his face turns to shock . ‘
125764	125800	125803	125803	I	363	’ he spits , and I return to the changing room laughing . He ’s right , I love it , but it is way too short . It could pass for an undergarment . I ’m
125804	125863	125803	125803	I	363	’m finally finished trying everything on . I ’ve changed more times in a couple of hours than I have this month . I go through the yes pile with Zoe and get a bit anxious when I realise just how many like items there are . I flick through the rail and try to narrow it down . ‘
125870	125879	125882	125882	she	1420	’ I hear him approach . I cringe . ‘

126270	126294	126295	126295	I	363	‘ You go and pick five dresses . Zoe has my card . My pin is one , nine , seven , four . ’
126298	126312	126295	126295	I	363	‘ I ca n’t believe you ’ve just told me your pin number . ’

126484	126488	126471	126471	I	363	‘ Thank you . ’
126490	126495	126489	126489	I	363	’m not sure whether I ’m

126589	126618	126619	126619	You	1424	’ he asks curiously . He liked all of them , but he did n’t see the gown that is safely out of view in a suit bag . ‘
126625	126640	126619	126619	You	1424	’ I inhale him into me as he nestles his face in my neck . ‘

126679	126708	126643	126644	my man	564	’ he asks casually , but I know he ’s worried that it does . It did n’t bother me before and it does n’t bother me now . ‘

126851	127024	127025	127025	We	1426	’ he asks . He did n’t appreciate that referral . I should n’t tease him when he clearly has an issue . I ca n’t keep a straight face and when he dips and tips me over his shoulder , I suppress a squeal . He ca n’t behave like this in Harrods ! I correct myself . Jesse has no regard for public opinion on his behaviour . He ’ll pick me up , ravish me , or even be blood boiling mad with me wherever he pleases . He does n’t give a toss and , quite frankly , neither do I. He carries me out of the store and on to Knightsbridge , setting me on my feet outside where I straighten my dress , take his offered hand and we start walking back towards the car . I do n’t even tick him off . It ’s fast becoming an everyday occurrence for him to hoof me about , whether it ’s in private or in public . ‘

127203	127228	127229	127229	He	1429	‘ Come on . I want to get done and get home so I can have a few hours of you all to myself . ’

127473	127482	127398	127398	She	59	’ Jesse squeezes my hand in his lap . ‘

127657	127677	127576	127577	Mr Ward	340	’ he says slowly , flicking a cautious eye at me . I hear John ’s low rumbling laugh . ‘

127693	127702	127689	127689	I	363	’ I shrug and look around the bar . ‘

127798	127884	127887	127887	Ruth	64	’ I shoo him away . They leave me at the bar among the chaos of staff , frantically polishing glasses and restocking the fridges . I feel like I should help , but then I hear my phone shouting from my bag and I pull it out , finding Ruth Quinn ’s name illuminating my screen . I should let it go to voicemail , it is my day off , but this could be my opportunity to get out of drinks with her . ‘

128572	128616	128617	128617	Voila	177	’m stunned by his little demonstration of barman skills . I would never have thought it . He knocks the container on the side of the bar and pours the dark pink liquid into a long glass with some mint and a strawberry . ‘

I shrug and take a little sip . ‘
128748	128768	128676	128676	You	1451	’ He dazzles me with his happy face and starts putting the lids on all the tubs of fruit . ‘

130578	130585	130546	130546	Jesse	431	’ I gasp at his shamelessness . ‘
130591	130599	130600	130600	I	363	’ I look over at my Mini . ‘

I want to crawl inside Jesse and stay put for a while , but after our unexpected trip around London in search of the elusive whiskey , we have n’t got as much time as I would have hoped . I know that is the cause of Jesse ’s downturn in mood . ‘
130936	130983	130932	130932	she	90	’ he answers shortly . He ’s really grumpy . We enter the foyer to the penthouse and Jesse balances my bags as he negotiates the key in the lock . He opens the door and I follow him in before taking the bags from him . ‘
130989	130997	130998	130998	I	363	’ he asks on a furrowed brow . ‘
130999	131015	131016	131016	I	363	’m taking these upstairs to the spare room . You ca n’t see my dress . ’

131522	131559	131487	131487	I	363	’ I smile to myself , silently wishing we could do exactly that right now , but then I feel his heart beating against my back and it has me thinking about his beating heart comment . ‘
131572	131584	131585	131585	Mine	363	’ I ask . He ’s silent for a few moments . ‘
131587	131601	131602	131602	You	76	’ he growls and bites my ear . I squirm above him laughing . ‘

131724	131764	131765	131765	You	76	’ He leans back and I rest my head back again . Triggered what ? A heartbeat ? I would think that a strange statement , but he triggered something in me too and that was also very disturbing . ‘
131771	131776	131765	131765	You	76	’ I say quietly . ‘
131787	131791	131779	131779	I	363	’ I smile . ‘

131994	132005	132006	132006	I	363	’ I ask in disbelief , performing a little shudder . ‘
132020	132069	132015	132015	You	76	’ he asks . I ca n’t see his face , but I would put my life on the likelihood of his roguish grin being firmly fixed on his lush face . I crane my head back . Yes , as I thought . I roll my eyes . ‘
132096	132158	132089	132089	I	363	’ I still ca n’t believe how blind I was to my surroundings and Jesse ’s clues that suggested The Manor was n’t a hotel at all .

Okay , the first one for sure , but the other two I think are probably reserved only for me . They are pretty strong words , considering we ’ve known each other for a month . At the beginning , I thought he was after one thing and one thing only , but his behaviour soon told me otherwise , even if I did ignore it . This man was relentless , and now I ’m

I savour the heat of his minty breath and meet his circling tongue with equal sentiment as he slides his palms all over my wet back . ‘

133223	133247	133222	133222	I	363	’m lifted again and brought down to meet his rising hips . I cry out , fighting the impulse to close my eyes . ‘
133253	133266	133222	133222	I	363	’ he asks , rewarding me with another flick of his hips . ‘
133269	133281	133222	133222	I	363	’ My knuckles whiten from my fierce grip on the bath . ‘
133289	133293	133294	133294	I	363	’m not ready . ’

133450	133474	133477	133477	Ava	0	’ I release the edge of the bath and pinch my nipples into stiffer nubs , rolling my fingers under his watchful eyes . ‘
133479	133512	133477	133477	Ava	0	’ he demands , punishing me with another hard blow of his hips . I cry out , clamping down further , the stab of pains shooting straight down to my sex . ‘
133515	133526	133527	133527	Jesse	431	’ he shouts , digging his thumbs into my waist . ‘
133529	133530	133527	133527	Jesse	431	’ ‘
133542	133599	133623	133623	he	431	’ I swallow hard , tensing every muscle in my body , going completely rigid above him . I do n’t know how he ’s doing this . I can see the strain in his face and his tense jaw , and I can feel it in his throbbing cock . His control is incredible . I ’m
133670	133675	133662	133662	I	363	‘ Jesse , please ! ’
133676	133682	133687	133687	He	431	‘ You want to come ? ’
133683	133686	133687	133687	He	431	‘ Yes ! ’

133841	133883	133838	133838	me	363	’ I drag my head from his chest and find his lips as he slowly circles his hips , wheedling every last bit of pleasure from us . Now , I could go to sleep right here on his wet chest . ‘
133889	133911	133912	133912	I	363	’ I mumble around his mouth . There is not a chance of getting out of tonight , I know this . ‘
133913	133917	133918	133918	he	363	’m ignoring you . ’
133954	133960	133961	133961	I	363	‘ Let me love you . ’
133984	134001	134002	134002	He	363	‘ Baby , do n’t . I hate saying no to you . Off you get . ’
134037	134044	134036	134036	I	363	’m offering my body to him . ‘
134051	134072	134073	134073	I	363	’ he says , grabbing a towel . I get myself out of the bath and turn the shower on . ‘
134081	134107	134073	134073	I	363	’ I retort , getting under the water to start shampooing my hair . As it happens , I am wearing it down , but I ’m
134152	134156	134145	134150	a glowering , extremely displeased man	59	‘ Shut up , ’
134167	134175	134176	134176	He	59	‘ You will wear your hair down . ’
134183	134188	134176	134176	He	59	‘ Wo n’t you ? ’
134189	134193	134194	134194	I	363	‘ I will . ’
134197	134203	134204	134204	He	59	‘ I know you will . ’
134211	134224	134204	134204	He	59	‘ You get ready in here , I ’ll use another room . ’
134225	134231	134232	134232	I	363	‘ Not the cream room ! ’
134238	134247	134232	134232	I	363	‘ Do n’t go in the cream room ! ’
134248	134255	134256	134256	I	363	‘ Unravel your knickers , lady . ’
134275	134317	134274	134274	I	363	’m standing in front of the floor length mirror gazing at myself , my stomach in absolute knots . My hair has been blow dried into glossy , tumbling waves , my make - up is delicate and natural , and I ’m
134336	134346	134335	134335	I	363	’m not sure if it ’s because of where I ’m
134355	134429	134354	134354	I	363	’m having an unreasonable pang of anxiety that Jesse wo n’t like the dress . I turn in the mirror to see the plunging back , which seems so much more revealing than it did in the store . Will he go mad ? He nearly had heart failure over a cut out panel in a summer dress . Blowing my hair out of my face , I spray some extra deodorant . I ’m
134483	134493	134494	134494	he	1514	‘ Ava ? Baby , we need to go . ’
134544	134548	134532	134532	he	1514	‘ Two minutes . ’
134617	134635	134616	134616	I	363	’m stupidly nervous . I ’ve got to face all the members of The Manor , and I ’m
134651	134666	134650	134650	I	363	’m a gatecrasher . I ca n’t imagine their opinion will change just because I ’m
134674	134870	134673	134673	I	363	’m officially Jesse ’s girlfriend . Girlfriend ? Well , that just sounds stupid , but what else would he call me ? And he seems a bit mature to be labeled my boyfriend . It just does n’t sound right . Okay . I gather the bottom of my gown up a little and admire my shoes before I make my way to the bedroom door and to the top of the stairs . As the huge open plan area comes into view , I hear the low mesmerising tones of The Moody Blues , Nights in White Satin falling over me from all of the integrated speakers . I smile to myself , and then I see him . I halt in my tracks at the top step and try to catch my breath . It ’s like seeing him for the first time all over again . He looks devastating in his black suit , crisp white shirt and black tie . He ’s freshly shaved so I can see him in all of his loveliness and his hair has been persuaded to the side with some wax . Oh God , I ’m
134954	135001	135004	135004	Jesus	155	’m nearby , his head snaps up to me and I get a full frontal impact of my stunning man in all of his glory . My breath hitches and I clasp the handrail on the stairs to steady myself . His eyes widen a touch . ‘
135006	135317	135004	135004	Jesus	155	’ he mouths , and I shift on my heels under his intense gaze . Our eyes lock and he starts walking slowly towards the stairs . I would start down to meet him , but my stupid legs are frozen firmly in place and no amount of mental encouragement is convincing them to move . He might need to carry me down the stairs . He takes the steps , all the time keeping his eyes firmly set on mine , and when he reaches me , he holds his hand out on a small smile . I take a deep breath and grasp my dress , placing my hand in his and letting him lead me down the stairs , my legs more solid now that he has hold of me . When we reach the bottom , he stops and turns to face me , running his eyes up and down my lace clad body . He takes a slow walk around to my back , and I clench my eyes shut , praying that I ’ve not made a mammoth error with my brave choice of a plunged back . I hear him inhale sharply , and then his warm fingertip meeting with the nape of my neck . He trails a slow , languid path down the centre on my spine , setting off a flurry of pins and needles all over my bare flesh . He finishes at the base of my spine and then there is the unmistakable heat of his mouth on my skin as he drops a kiss on the centre of my back . I physically relax under the warmth of his lips . He would have disintegrated by now if he was going to . He slowly makes his way back around to my front and locates my eyes . ‘
135325	135359	135004	135004	Jesus	155	’ he murmurs , snaking his hand around my waist and pulling me into him , taking my mouth tenderly , like I ’ve become as delicate as the lace encasing me . I ’m
135427	135434	135435	135435	he	1518	‘ I really like your dress . ’
135442	135457	135435	135435	he	1518	‘ You did n’t try this one . I would have remembered this one . ’
135467	135472	135458	135458	He	1518	‘ Always in lace . ’
135487	135495	135496	135496	he	1518	‘ You chose this dress for me ? ’
135544	135552	135553	135553	He	1518	‘ Like I chose this for you ? ’
135674	135683	135684	135684	I	363	‘ Jesse , that necklace was sixty grand ! ’
135789	135824	135825	135825	You	1520	’m starting to shake . His hands skim my back as he fastens the clasp and then he slides his palms onto my shoulders and rests his lips on the nape of my neck . ‘
135828	135835	135788	135788	I	363	’ he whispers in my ear . ‘
135843	135868	135838	135838	I	363	’ I reach up and feel the diamond , then instantly want to get a velvet cloth and polish my finger print from it . ‘
135874	135914	135870	135870	Zoe	169	’ I feel sick . I know she is technically in sales , but to tell Jesse that I was completely rapt by an obscenely expensive diamond necklace is taking advantage . Sixty thousand pounds ? Oh , heck ! ‘
135926	135949	135917	135917	I	363	’ He turns me around in his arms and runs his fingertips over the necklace and down the centre of my chest . ‘
135955	135972	135950	135950	You	1520	’ He kisses my lips softly . He asked her ? I laugh a nervous laugh . ‘
135982	135983	135950	135950	You	1520	’ ‘
135990	135998	135950	135950	You	1520	’ he says on a raised brow . ‘
136005	136011	136012	136012	Jesse	431	’ My laughter abates instantly . ‘
136023	136025	136012	136012	Jesse	431	’ I ’m
136031	136037	136038	136038	He	431	‘ Ava , shut up . ’
136046	136073	136074	136074	His	431	‘ It ’s insured and it ’s a gift from me . If you do n’t wear it , I ’ll be crazy mad . Understand ? ’
136078	136089	136077	136077	I	363	’m not to argue with him on this , but I ’m
136182	136192	136169	136169	I	363	‘ I really do n’t know what to say . ’
136203	136211	136212	136212	His	431	‘ You could say you love it . ’
136219	136226	136212	136212	His	431	‘ You could say thank you . ’
136227	136236	136237	136237	I	363	‘ I do love it . Thank you . ’
136244	136266	136267	136267	He	431	‘ You are more than welcome , baby . It ’s not as beautiful as you , though . Nothing is . ’
136275	136292	136293	136293	He	431	‘ My work here is done . Come on , you ’ve made your God late . ’
136353	136355	136345	136345	He	431	‘ You ’re
136359	136383	136386	136386	mine	363	’ I say wistfully , reaching up and dragging my thumb across his bottom lip to wipe the remnants of my lipstick away . ‘
136388	136401	136403	136403	yours	363	’ He grabs my hand and kisses the tip of my finger . ‘
136407	136558	136403	136403	yours	363	’ As we walk through the foyer of Lusso , Clive does a double take and gapes slightly . Jesse ’s arm goes firmly around my shoulder , and I know this is a sign of things to come tonight , which is fine because I do n’t plan on leaving his side all night . He helps me into the DBS and we travel to The Manor at high speed . I ’ve made him late for his own anniversary party , but he does n’t seem that bothered . He tosses his eyes over to me every so often and half smiles when I catch him looking at me . I rest my palm on his firm thigh and relax completely when he places his hand on mine , giving it a reassuring squeeze . I am so in love with him right now and , unexpectedly , I ’m
136600	136621	136624	136624	I	363	’m not ignorant to the fact that I only see this Jesse when things are going his way , when I ’m
136625	136637	136624	136624	I	363	’m told and he ’s getting what he wants , but I ’m
136666	136811	136665	136665	I	363	’m not surprised to see John on the steps of The Manor when we pull up . Jesse collects me from the car and leads me to the entrance where John is briefing a dozen or so men in full valet attire . Jesse chucks his keys at John , who catches them and passes them to one of the valets with strict instructions to only move the Aston Martin if absolutely necessary . I put my hand up to John , and he smiles broadly at me as we pass , flashing me his gold tooth . He is in his usual black suit , except he has replaced the black shirt in favour of a white one with a black bow tie . The shades are still firmly in position , though . He looks really smart . He absolutely oozes coolness . ‘
136816	137013	136813	136813	you	1529	’ Sarah ’s panicked voice is the first thing to attack my ears as we enter The Manor . She is scuttling towards us , her legs restricted to small shifting movements due to the tight , red , satin dress that could qualify as a second skin . She must have poured herself into the thing . If there was any doubt previously regarding the status of her breasts , they have just been completely eradicated . They are hoist up in the strapless dress and if she lowered her lips , she could kiss them . She halts her hasty advance on Jesse and gives me the once over , her eyes finishing and remaining on my neck . She ’s spotted the necklace , which is hardly surprising , you ca n’t exactly miss it , but she is not dazzled by the beauty or sparkle – not a chance – she is weighing up the likelihood of who has bought it and judging by her screwed by botox pumped face , she has hit the nail right on the head . I instinctively reach up and clasp the diamond , almost like I ’m
137047	137049	137039	137039	I	363	‘ I ’m
137053	137117	137039	137039	I	363	’ Jesse grumbles , as he pulls me along beside him . We enter the bar and find Mario dishing out firm instructions to the bar staff . The bar has tripled in size and I realise that the folding doors dividing the bar and restaurant have been opened and dozens of tall bar tables and stools have been scattered between the rooms . ‘
137122	137151	137039	137039	I	363	’ He lifts me onto a stool at the bar and calls Mario over before sitting himself opposite me . Sarah points at a spreadsheet in her hand . ‘
137158	137159	137160	137160	Sarah	59	’ ‘
137167	137185	137160	137160	Sarah	59	’ Jesse cuts her off , without taking his eyes from me . I could kiss him . ‘
137193	137297	137160	137160	Sarah	59	’ he asks . I can feel the ice emanating from Sarah as she stands there like a plum and waits for Jesse to tend to me before he gives her the attention she ’s demanding . I might take a while to decide . Can I have alcohol ? He did say I can drink if he is around . Mario appears , looking rather dapper in his white waistcoat and bow tie , his hair combed precisely to the side and his moustache neatly trimmed . He smiles brightly and I remember the lush cocktail he made for me earlier today . ‘
137308	137318	137160	137160	Sarah	59	’ I grin at Mario . He laughs loudly . ‘
137321	137329	137330	137331	Mr Ward	340	’ He starts faffing at the bar . ‘
137333	137334	137330	137331	Mr Ward	340	’ ‘
137343	137398	137341	137341	Mario	175	’ Jesse replies , leaning towards me for a kiss . I can feel Sarah ’s eyes drilling into me , so , of course , I oblige and let him have his way . Not that I need Sarah around to do that . He has his way wherever and whenever he chooses . ‘
137404	137451	137452	137452	Jesse	431	’ she snaps petulantly , and then proceeds to huff while Jesse gets his fix of me . He really does not have any regard for this woman , and I feel all the more comfortable for it . She ’s not even really a threat . ‘
137464	137473	137452	137452	Jesse	431	’ she presses . He growls , and I ’m
137483	137488	137489	137489	he	431	‘ Sarah , please ! ’
137499	137517	137489	137489	he	431	‘ Baby , do you want to stay here or would you like to come with me ? ’
137519	137547	137518	137518	I	363	’m not looking at her , but I know she has just rolled her eyes , and while I would love to piss her off more , I ’m
137561	137563	137567	137567	you	1534	‘ I ’m
137570	137583	137584	137584	I	363	’ He grabs his water and pushes his lips to my forehead . ‘
137589	137642	137584	137584	I	363	’ He stalks off , leaving Sarah to virtually jog on her eight inch heels in order to keep up with him , but not before she leans across me to retrieve her gin from the bar on a snarl . I ignore it and accept my drink from a smiling Mario . ‘
137648	137662	137663	137664	Miss Ava	0	’ I return his smile and take a sip , gasping in gratitude . ‘
137677	137687	137688	137688	Mario	175	’ He smiles fondly , and I blush slightly . ‘
137701	137760	137761	137761	He	175	’ I raise my glass to the small Italian man , who I have become rather fond of . He slaps the bar on a sharp burst of laughter , and then his eyes fall onto the diamond that ’s suspended around my neck before he tips his eyes back up to me with a high raised eyebrow . ‘
137769	137799	137806	137806	Mario	175	’ I give a little embarrassed shrug , feeling suddenly uncomfortable with the friendly Italian . I do n’t want everyone thinking the inevitable , just like Sarah did . ‘
137808	137852	137806	137806	Mario	175	’ A Sixty grand necklace , yes , but no one has to know that small detail . I reach up to grasp it again . I have to keep checking it ’s there , even though I can feel the weight perfectly . ‘
137864	137873	137806	137806	Mario	175	’ He smiles and tops my glass up . ‘
137879	138039	138040	138040	Ava	0	’ It does ? He gets distracted by a smashed glass and goes stalking off , waving his arms around and shouting in Italian . I sit happily at the bar watching the staff preparing for the evening . Champagne is poured into hundreds of glasses and the bar is repeatedly wiped down by Mario . He shouts instructions around and points here and there to guide his staff . This is like a finely tuned execution of organisation – he knows what he is doing . The little Italian is a perfectionist , making everything just so . The huge room looks stunningly made up , everything obviously arranged precisely and with the utmost attention to detail . The low hanging chandeliers are shimmering subtly , giving off a soft apricot glow of light , the words sensuous and invigorating springing to mind immediately – words I have heard before . Pete appears with a tray of canapés . ‘
138046	138054	138042	138042	you	1534	’ He presents me with the tray . ‘
138061	138082	138085	138085	Pete	176	’ I take in the glorious smell of smoked salmon and spy the small flat breads caked in cream cheese . ‘
138087	138096	138097	138097	I	363	’ I place my hand on my stomach . ‘
138098	138104	138105	138105	I	363	’m still full from lunch . ’
138111	138128	138129	138129	Ava	0	’m going to manage a three course meal . I ’ll burst out of this dress . ‘

138155	138156	138157	138157	You	1534	’ ‘
138162	138214	138160	138160	Pete	176	’ I reply , feeling immediately silly for telling a member of Jesse ’s staff to enjoy their evening of working hard , but he ’s right , I did n’t finish my lunch . That ’s because I lost my appetite when Sarah rocked up and it ’s probably why I ’m
138326	138329	138311	138311	I	363	‘ Ava ! ’
138346	138349	138350	138350	She	1538	‘ Whoa ! ’
138368	138372	138360	138360	her	1538	‘ Fucking hell ! ’
138373	138377	138378	138378	I	363	‘ I know . ’
138381	138383	138378	138378	I	363	‘ I ’m
138397	138419	138378	138378	I	363	’ I reach up and fiddle with it again , and Kate bats my hand away to cop a feel herself . ‘
138428	138441	138378	138378	I	363	’ She drops the diamond and stands back to eye me up . ‘
138453	138469	138446	138446	Someone	2607	’ I laugh . I think what I have been today is way past spoilt . ‘
138474	138487	138488	138488	I	363	’ I grab her hands and hold them out to the side . ‘
138493	138527	138488	138488	I	363	’ I send her on a little twirl . She looks fabulous , as always , in a long , green gown , her red locks vibrant and piled high on her head . ‘
138541	138554	138534	138534	You	1539	’ I grasp my glass from the bar and hold it up . ‘
138563	138575	138576	138576	He	564	’ She pushes herself onto the stool and rolls her eyes . ‘
138591	138605	138606	138606	She	1543	’re all driving morons who ca n’t handle the power of a Carrera . ’
138609	138614	138606	138606	She	1543	‘ Where ’s Jesse ? ’
138619	138626	138627	138627	I	363	‘ Sarah dragged him off somewhere , ’
138643	138671	138672	138672	I	363	‘ Anyway , I could n’t help but notice a certain Carrera , with a certain red head in it , pulling into The Manor yesterday evening . ’
138703	138715	138716	138716	she	1543	‘ Yes , Ava . You ’ve already pointed that out . ’
138720	138726	138716	138716	she	1543	‘ Get me that drink . ’
138739	138742	138743	138743	I	363	‘ Mario ? ’
138756	138769	138747	138747	he	1544	‘ This is my friend Kate . Kate , this is Mario . ’
138770	138777	138778	138778	Kate	431	‘ Yes , we ’ve met . ’
138783	138792	138793	138793	Mario	175	‘ How are you this evening , Kate ? ’
138804	138817	138818	138818	She	1543	‘ I ’ll be better when you get me one of those . ’
138847	138904	138846	138846	I	363	’m so envious of her laidback nature . Mario returns with his jug and I slap my hand over my glass when he tries and fill mine again , throwing him a playful , warning look . He shrugs , muttering something in Italian and fighting a smile , clearly trying to pretend he ’s offended . ‘
138910	138997	138998	138998	Ladies	1546	’ We both turn and see Sam stood , legs spread and arms extended in the entrance of the bar . He looks unusually smart , compared to his traditional baggy jeans and t - shirt combo . He straightens his suit jacket and waltzes to the bar confidently , shouting for a bottle of beer as he approaches . He may look smart , but his hair is its usual mop of brown , messy waves and his cheeky grin and dimple are ever present . ‘
139007	139014	139015	139015	He	1546	’re both looking this pleasant evening ? ’
139036	139042	139043	139043	he	1546	‘ Where ’s my man ? ’
139096	139103	139085	139085	I	363	‘ He ’s in his office . ’
139115	139213	139114	139114	I	363	’m pacing myself , but this stuff is delicious and going down a treat . I feel better now that Kate is here , my mind distracted from the fact that Jesse is still missing . An hour later , the bar is crammed full and Jesse is still nowhere to be seen . Soft jazz is playing in the background and the sound of happy chatter is prominent in the air . The men all look fine in tuxes and suits and the woman have all gone to town in various gowns and cocktail dresses . I ’m
139295	139367	139368	139368	I	363	’m on my third glass of the Most Marvelous stuff and sipping it cautiously . Drew has arrived and actually looks no different to normal . He always looks well groomed and precise . I exhale and relax when I feel two big palms rest on my hips and his fresh water , minty loveliness drift into my nose . Where has he been ? His chin rests on my shoulder . ‘
139373	139382	139368	139368	I	363	’ I crane my neck to see him . ‘
139393	139394	139395	139395	I	363	’ ‘
139410	139418	139419	139419	He	2607	’m all yours now , I promise . ’
139435	139467	139433	139434	the boys	296	’ before leaning towards Kate so she can kiss his cheek . I can guarantee that all of the someone ’s who he could n’t get two yards past were women . ‘
139472	139483	139484	139484	We	1554	’ he asks as he waves Mario for some water . ‘
139494	139546	139484	139484	We	1554	’ Sam grins and chinks bottles with Drew . I know what he ’s getting at , and I distinctively remember Jesse giving firm instructions for the upstairs to remain locked until ten thirty . Now I know why ; to keep keen people , such as Sam , out . I ’m
139588	139611	139587	139587	I	363	’m thinking – I can tell by the way she ’s turning her body further away from me , hiding her face . ‘
139615	139662	139663	139663	I	363	’ Jesse says sternly . He pulls me off the stool and sits there himself before pulling me down onto his lap and burying his face into my neck . Sam and Drew throw each other disapproving looks and Kate still refuses to look at me . ‘
139682	139723	139663	139663	I	363	’ he whispers in my ear . I stiffen over him and silently wish for him to shut up immediately before I oblige and climb up onto the bar for him . He pushes his groin up into my backside . ‘
139730	139731	139663	139663	I	363	’ ‘
139735	139768	139769	139769	You	1557	’ I say quietly on a smile , and he groans in my ear . Why did I say that ? I need to curb the sex talk , not encourage it . ‘
139770	139775	139776	139776	He	1557	’re fucking killing me . ’
139788	139794	139776	139776	He	1557	‘ You have to stop . ’
139856	139859	139860	139860	His	1557	‘ Never . ’
139876	139880	139881	139881	Kate	431	‘ You guys ! ’
139888	139893	139881	139881	Kate	431	‘ Put her down ! ’
139894	139898	139881	139881	Kate	431	‘ Yeah , you ’re
139918	139930	139934	139934	me	363	’ Sam complains . Jesse lands Sam with a reproachful glare . ‘
139947	139948	139949	139949	You	1560	’ ‘
139950	139956	139957	139957	I	363	’re trampling your mates now . ’
139977	139982	139983	139983	I	363	‘ Who ’s that ? ’
139986	139991	139992	139992	His	431	‘ Who ’s who ? ’
140138	140155	140156	140156	Coral	183	’m suddenly standing and being positioned back on the stool , minus one Jesse beneath me . ‘
140167	140193	140156	140156	Coral	183	’ Jesse asks , way too soft and gently for my liking . She nods , and I can see her eyes brimming with tears . ‘
140197	140275	140156	140156	Coral	183	’ He turns to me , offering an apologetic smile before leading her away with his hand placed at the bottom of her back , leaving me sat wondering what the hell is going on and mentally demanding him to remove his hand from her . John gives him a nod as they pass at the bar entrance , and then proceeds to notify everyone that dinner will be served imminently . There is a bustle of bodies ’
140298	140325	140297	140297	I	363	’m too busy wondering what Jesse is doing with the mystery woman . The silence that has fallen in our little group is broken by Kate . ‘
140330	140370	140371	140371	I	363	’ She helps me down from my stool . I glance at Drew and Sam , who both shrug denial of any knowledge , but I can tell by their sudden discomfort that they know exactly who Coral is . ‘
140383	140400	140401	140401	Jesse	431	’ I say on a frown , following the mass of people into the summer room . ‘
140409	140421	140401	140401	Jesse	431	’ I add dryly . We find our table , and I ’m
140438	140662	140664	140664	she	1572	’m not so pleased that Sarah is also with us , though . Another man , who I ’ve not met , joins us . He ’s introduced as Niles – a cute , floppy haired public schoolboy type , not the kind of man I would expect to find at The Manor at all . But what is The Manor ’s type ? The summer room has been completely emptied of sofas and occasional tables , and in their place are masses of round tables , seating between eight and ten people . I ca n’t even count them , I lose track at table thirty . The colour scheme is black and gold . I wonder if that ’s an accident . Candles are burning everywhere , enhancing the key ingredient ; sensual . It was on Jesse ’s specification for the extension and at the time , when I was oblivious to The Manor ’s activities , it was a weird request , but now the descriptor it cropping up everywhere I look . A band is set up in the corner , but it ’s the four men with saxophones who are providing the music throughout dinner . The chair next to me is still empty and the one next to that has Sarah perched neatly on it . I ’m
140724	140841	140723	140723	I	363	’m not even going to look inside mine , and my decision is only reinforced when Kate shoves her nose in and then snaps the bag shut with wide blue eyes . Sam tries to snatch it from her , but she bats him away and he grumbles , grabbing the men ’s black equivalent that ’s positioned at his place setting . He does the same little rendition as Kate , but instead of a wide eyed , stunned look , he looks at Kate and grins from ear to ear , prompting her to make a grab for his bag . He pushes her away . A starter of scallops is served , and I ’m
140861	140867	140869	140869	you	1575	‘ So , Ava , I ’m
140877	140884	140869	140869	you	1575	’ Niles says across the table . ‘
140889	140899	140869	140869	you	1575	’ He smiles , raising his glass to me . ‘
140907	140912	140913	140913	You	1575	’ I reply casually . ‘
140914	140917	140918	140918	He	1575	’re modest . ’
140921	140926	140927	140927	Kate	431	‘ She ’s good , ’
140931	140940	140941	140941	Kate	431	‘ She ’s working on the extension upstairs . ’
140958	140969	140941	140941	Kate	431	‘ I see . Is that how you met Jesse ? ’
140977	140981	140982	140982	I	363	‘ It is . ’
140991	141025	140990	140990	I	363	’m not comfortable talking about me and Jesse , especially with a stone faced Sarah within touching distance . Niles has also just reminded me that he is still nowhere to be seen . ‘
141031	141059	141060	141060	I	363	’ I ask to steer the conversation away from Jesse and my curious mind . He puts his fork down and wipes his mouth with his napkin . ‘
141066	141153	141060	141060	I	363	’ he says on a small smile . I just about manage to stop myself from asking the most stupid question I ever would . He does n’t supply food or drink to The Manor . No , Niles supplies other essentials – essentials for the top floors of The Manor . I nod my acknowledgment , not wanting to push that line of chat any further . Sarah jumps into the gap of conversation , asking Niles how his recent trip to Amsterdam went . I ’m
141388	141476	141477	141477	You	1580	’m thankful dinner is relatively light . I could n’t stomach much more and with Sarah sat next to me , my appetite is not improving . She has n’t said one word to me during dinner and has not enquired as to Jesse ’s whereabouts , so I assume that she knows . She advises the waiter to remove Jesse ’s untouched starter and hold off on his main for the meantime . If Kate was n’t here , I would be getting really cranky now . ‘
141483	141502	141505	141505	she	67	’ Kate tosses the question at Drew and he catches it without an ounce of shock or surprise . ‘
141512	141526	141505	141505	she	67	’ He takes a swig of wine and sits back in his chair . ‘
141528	141538	141539	141539	He	363	’m happy exactly where I am at the moment . ’
141554	141569	141553	141553	I	363	’m not particularly happy about where I am at the moment . Drew continues , ‘
141587	141606	141607	141607	I	363	’ I nearly spit my wine all over the table , then proceed to laugh – really hard . ‘
141611	141660	141607	141607	I	363	’ Kate screeches , throwing a napkin over the table at me . I grab it and start mopping up the wine dripping down my chin , still laughing . Drew looks at me and Kate in turn , a smirk breaking the corners of his serious face . ‘
141669	141678	141607	141607	I	363	’re doing for what I had in mind . ’
141679	141682	141683	141683	I	363	‘ Stop ! ’
141702	141934	141701	141701	I	363	’m met with a filthy glare . I ignore her and resist the killing temptation to smash her face into her salmon . I sit bolt upright – as does Sarah – when I spot Jesse and the mystery woman emerging from the corridor that leads down to his office . John must catch our sharp reaction because he jumps up from the table and makes his way over . They have an exchange of quiet words before John takes over responsibility of the woman and leads her out of the summer room . Jesse looks across the room until he finds my eyes , and then starts making his way over . He ’s stopped a dozen times by various men and women as he passes tables , but he does n’t hang about for conversation . He just shakes hands with the men and leans down to kiss the women , smiling politely before searching me out again . Why ca n’t he shake the women ’s hands as well ? He eventually makes it to me and sits himself down , grabbing my knee under the table . Sam cheers his arrival and pours some water into Jesse ’s wine glass , Kate frowns at me and Sarah drops all conversation with Niles in favour of Jesse . He turns into me and gives me very sorry eyes . ‘
141938	141939	141701	141701	I	363	’ ‘
141944	141949	141701	141701	I	363	’ I ask quietly . ‘
141959	141968	141701	141701	I	363	’ He nods at my half empty plate . ‘
141974	142006	141701	141701	I	363	’ No one for me to be concerned about ? Well , that just makes me all the more concerned , but is this really the time to be pushing this ? ‘
142015	142027	141701	141701	I	363	’ I say shortly , looking for a waiter , but I ’m
142073	142164	142072	142072	I	363	’m prepared to leave this for now , this is not the time or the place , but I want to know what that was about . When John returns and does his signature nod at Jesse , I throw him a curious stare which he catches and tramples all over by leaning in and lavishing me with his lips . I only half - heartedly return his kiss , fully aware that he ’s trying to distract me again . He pulls back , giving me an enquiring eye . ‘
142172	142177	142181	142181	you	1583	’ he asks sharply . ‘
142183	142198	142181	142181	you	1583	’ I toss back at him , unimpressed by his attitude towards my concern . ‘
142201	142216	142181	142181	you	1583	’ he grates , quite loudly , considering the close proximity of our company . ‘
142222	142226	142227	142227	he	363	’re talking to ? ’
142245	142268	142240	142240	I	363	‘ Let ’s see what your reaction would be if a mystery man pulled me away from you for over an hour . ’
142291	142337	142338	142338	Ava	0	’m in no mood for her . His eyes soften , his tense jaw easing up a bit . He releases his grip of my knee and strokes up to the juncture of my thighs . I tense . He knows what he ’s doing . ‘
142352	142370	142371	142371	I	363	’ His voice has softened , but I can still detect the slight anger in his tone . ‘
142386	142387	142392	142393	the women	3402	’ ‘
142395	142412	142392	142393	the women	3402	’ I turn back towards the table , ignoring his hot touch through my dress . I ’m
142421	142535	142420	142420	I	363	’m getting as bad as him , and this conversation is going to get us nowhere – not here and now , anyway . Chapter 21 When dessert and coffee has been served and my cheeks hurt from Kate and Sam antics at the table , John stands and announces , in his usual booming voice , that everyone should clear the room so it can be emptied of tables , ready for the band . Jesse stands and helps me up from my chair , making a meal of showering me with attention , which I petulantly brush off . He ’s trying his hardest to distract me from my sulks . I ’m
142554	142571	142544	142544	he	1585	’re front on front . He burns a hole into me with pools of green displeasure . ‘
142603	142638	142641	142641	his	1590	’ I recoil at his animosity as he looks past me and smiles , obviously acknowledging someone who is behind me . He returns his eyes to mine , his smile disappearing instantly . I ’m
142701	142707	142708	142708	He	1590	‘ Do you feel that ? ’
142742	142751	142741	142741	I	363	’m going to let him take me while we ’re
142759	142766	142767	142767	He	1590	‘ Answer the question , Ava . ’
142786	142791	142792	142792	My	363	‘ I feel it . ’
142799	142810	142811	142811	He	1590	‘ Good . It ’s yours . All of it . ’
142819	142832	142811	142811	He	1590	‘ So stop with the fucking sulks . Do you understand me ? ’
142833	142836	142837	142837	I	363	‘ Yes . ’
142875	142966	142874	142874	I	363	’m trembling and seriously rethinking my vow to avoid sex at The Manor . I could , quite easily , drag him upstairs to one of the private suites and let him eat me alive . I glance past him and catch the viper glare of Sarah , and in a pathetic stamp of ownership , I put myself into Jesse ’s chest again and look up at him with sorry eyes . He gives an approving nod of his head and leans down to rest his lips on mine . ‘
142971	142992	142993	142993	I	363	’ he says into my mouth . He turns me around and starts guiding me out of the summer room . ‘
142994	143005	142993	142993	I	363	’m struggling to deal with all of the admiring stares you ’re
143008	143031	142993	142993	I	363	’ he says , placing his hand firmly at my lower back . I scoff . He has to be joking . I ’m
143048	143054	143055	143055	You	1592	’m severely gatecrashing their party . ‘
143056	143065	143066	143066	I	363	’re attracting quite a bit of attention yourself . ’
143087	143091	143077	143077	She	1594	‘ Jesse , you ’re
143098	143126	143130	143130	she	1594	’ she gushes . I ca n’t help the small shocked burst of laughter that flies from my mouth . She ’s got some front , and I ’m
143148	143175	143147	143147	I	363	’m about to stop and put her in her place , but Jesse pushes me on , preventing me from following through on my intent . I ’m
143182	143193	143194	143194	Jesse	431	‘ Natasha , you are an intolerable flirt as ever . ’
143253	143267	143252	143252	I	363	’m going to be spending much time here if this is the response I ’m
143312	143379	143311	143311	I	363	’m stepping on a million attractive women ’s toes . And that ’s another point ; does Jesse only offer membership to women who are of an eight or above on the good looks scale ? Retirement is looking more likely as time goes on . I want to spend every second stuck to Jesse so I can slap down these brazen , desperate tarts . I ’m
143426	143456	143425	143425	I	363	’m lifted onto the stool and Mario is with us without delay , leaving the members of The Manor to be served by one of the other bar staff . ‘

I flush the chain , silencing all three , and make sure my dress is n’t tucked into my bodice before I swing the door open and walk casually out of the cubicle . I smile politely at the three women , all with some sort of make - up suspended in front of their faces , staring completely flummoxed at me as I make my way to a mirror at the other end of the bathroom .

I ca n’t even reflect that far back . At the moment , I ’m

149651	149662	149650	149650	I	363	’m not surprised . He called Sarah to free him ? ’

149688	149695	149696	149696	She	1678	‘ Why would he call her ? ’
149716	149735	149708	149708	she	1678	‘ He could n’t get hold of anyone else . John was here and Sam was otherwise engaged . ’

149744	149747	149748	149748	I	363	‘ Wednesday . ’
149779	149796	149797	149797	Sarah	59	’m not even going to ask why Sam was unable to come to Jesse ’s rescue . ‘

149932	149990	149880	149880	I	363	’ He thrusts a glass of water under my nose , and I take it without complaint . I watch him smile as I down the glass of water , before I hand him the empty glass . He nods in surprised approval , then replaces the empty with a glass of Mario ’s Most Marvelous stuff . ‘

I sit up straight and wait with baited breath to see if she is yanked to the left towards the stairs , or to the right towards the summer room . They go to the right . I exhale , immensely relieved . I ca n’t even think about that . ‘

150849	150857	150836	150836	I	363	‘ It ’s nice to meet you . ’

151094	151107	151108	151108	he	191	‘ Jesse , I apologise . I assumed she was fair game . ’
151111	151115	151116	151116	I	363	‘ Excuse me ? ’

151297	151300	151301	151301	I	363	‘ Murderous ? ’
151316	151319	151304	151304	I	363	‘ Deadly . ’
151320	151328	151333	151333	He	191	‘ Are all the women fair game ? ’
151336	151350	151333	151333	He	191	‘ You do n’t join The Manor if you are n’t sexually adventurous . ’
151377	151436	151376	151376	I	363	’m sharing company with look like any other people , but they are all here for one reason and that has nothing to do with the posh sports facilities that The Manor boasts . One thing is certain , judging by all of the prestigious cars that are often parked outside – they are all very rich people . ‘
151443	151465	151376	151376	I	363	’ I ask . My curiosity is getting the better of me . He works his face right into my neck . ‘

151479	151489	151476	151476	I	363	’ I say flippantly . He bites my neck . ‘
151498	151508	151496	151496	lady	59	’ He pulls me up further onto his lap . ‘
151512	151513	151496	151496	lady	59	’ ‘
151517	151526	151496	151496	lady	59	’ That ’s not bad . He laughs . ‘
151533	151536	151496	151496	lady	59	’ WHAT ? ‘
151539	151556	151496	151496	lady	59	’ He clamps his teeth on my ear and then rolls his hips into my bum . ‘
151559	151616	151496	151496	lady	59	’ I moan a little at his evident hard state . Forty five thousand a year is ridiculous money . These people must all be stupid or desperate , but as I look around , there are no particularly ugly men and women . They all look like they could get some if they wanted to . ‘
151624	151645	151620	151620	Kate	431	’ I know she ’s not short of a few quid , but she is very shrewd with her cash . ‘
151651	151683	151684	151684	Sam	564	’ he asks on a little laugh . I do n’t know ? Did Jesse waiver the membership fee because she ’s my friend ? Would he do that ? Oh ! ‘
151686	151692	151693	151693	Sam	564	’ I say in realisation . ‘

151719	151757	151758	151758	I	363	’m on another planet at the moment . This sort of thing is way past my comprehension and here I am , dining and drinking with these people and dating the owner . Who would have thought ? ‘
151764	151787	151788	151788	Ava	0	’ I grumble . Kate might be laidback , but I ca n’t help thinking that she is coasting towards complete disaster . ‘
151799	151805	151788	151788	Ava	0	’ I scowl to myself . ‘
151812	151855	151856	151856	Someone	2607	’ I really am very interested in the workings of The Manor and the lifestyle these people choose to lead . He brings his palm up to my forehead and pushes back until the back of my head rests on his shoulder . ‘
151867	151895	151856	151856	Someone	2607	’ He kisses my cheek . I shrug casually in a gesture that suggests I could n’t care less whether he told me or not , but I ’m

151945	151984	151944	151944	they	3483	’re not all active at the moment . Some we do n’t see from one month to the next , some of them meet people and start a relationship and others take a break from the whole scene . ’
152007	152015	151988	151988	I	363	‘ Is the restaurant and bar included ? ’
152016	152019	152020	152020	he	2607	‘ No ! ’
152053	152117	152118	152118	He	2607	‘ The bar and restaurant are a separate entity . Some members eat breakfast , lunch and dinner here four or five times a week . I would n’t be making much money if I included all meals and drinks in with their memberships . They have accounts they settle on a monthly basis . Turn around , I need to see you . ’
152149	152157	152158	152158	he	2607	‘ Would you like to see upstairs ? ’
152271	152274	152262	152262	I	363	‘ Okay . ’
152421	152432	152433	152433	Jesse	431	‘ We need to get cracking on those next week . ’
152453	152456	152457	152457	he	2607	‘ Ready ? ’
152581	152583	152565	152565	He	2607	‘ You ’re
152586	152590	152565	152565	He	2607	’ he murmurs . ‘
152593	152602	152565	152565	He	2607	’ I confess without hesitation . I am . ‘
152633	152638	152639	152639	His	2607	’re out of there . ’
152654	152700	152648	152648	He	2607	’m calmer , more comfortable and at ease , as he gives me a gentle tug towards the stairs . I kick my feet into gear and let him lead me up the stairs , my heart jumping a little harder as we get closer . ‘
152756	152763	152770	152770	I	363	’ He looks down and grins . ‘
152771	152793	152794	152794	He	363	’m making it my mission objective to ensure that every man knows what the consequences will be if they approach you . ’
152800	152808	152809	152809	he	363	‘ I might send a memo out . ’
152985	152996	152984	152984	I	363	’m surrounded by semi and fully naked people , and I ’m
153056	153132	153055	153055	I	363	’m fully dressed . I look up at him and see how unperturbed he is by the surroundings . Why would he be ? This is normal for him . Unfolding before my eyes are various scenes , all of which muddle my mind , but at the same time totally captivate me . It ’s difficult not to look . He glances down at me and smiles , giving my hand a little squeeze . ‘
153135	153507	153055	153055	I	363	’ he asks , as he comes to a stop and turns to face me . I nod and offer him a small smile . I look down at our joined hands when I feel him run his thumb over the top of mine . He has literally drawn all of the anxiety out of me with his touch . As I gaze back up at him , I find his eyes are watching our hands too . He continues to smooth his thumb over my skin as he turns to face a young woman , who is probably late twenties and trussed up on a heavy , wooden cross - like frame , just like the one in the extension . She ’s blindfolded with black satin and her mouth is slightly agape . A man , naked from the waist up with legs slightly spread , stands before her , holding a crop in his hand . The look in his eyes is one of pure lust and appreciation as he slowly , deliberately traces the curves of her breasts with the tip . She ’s rippling under its touch . Jesse ’s hand shifts slightly in mine , and I look up at him , but his gaze is set firmly on the scene before us . I return my eyes to the bound woman as the man slowly draws the crop down her front , between her breasts and towards her abdomen , circling the tip around her bellybutton in meticulous , measured movements . She ’s whimpering . I shift on my heels and Jesse flicks me a curious glance . I ignore him and watch as the man continues his decent until the crop meets the juncture of her thighs and as she lets out a loud moan , he crashes his mouth against hers to swallow her sounds . He discards the crop and replaces it with his fingers , separating her and beginning a slow friction , up and down , building up her pleasure and her moans . Her body arches , pulling the restraints that are holding her hands secure to the frame , a signal that she ’s close . I ’m
153612	153620	153611	153611	I	363	’m so surprised by it all . We ’re
154035	154064	154034	154034	I	363	’m completely cocooned by his body and despite my surroundings and what is taking place in it , this is the most comforting place I have ever been . ‘
154076	154197	154034	154034	I	363	’ he whispers in my ear . Move on to what ? Will that be my thing ? I resent the exposure I feel when he releases his big body from mine , but I let him take my hand and lead me away . I hear the crack of the crop again and again as we leave the area , and I snap my eyes shut each time , holding my breath . I just ca n’t grasp what I ’ve just witnessed . Pleasure and pain ? Just the pleasure please ! That part looked good , but then I remember being handcuffed myself and Jesse ’s hard slaps across my backside as he slammed into me . I ’m
154211	154217	154218	154218	I	363	‘ What is this music ? ’
154241	154250	154232	154232	He	1747	‘ Enigma . Is it making you horny ? ’
154251	154254	154255	154255	I	363	‘ No . ’
154268	154318	154267	154267	I	363	’m not going to admit it , although my finger twiddling wildly in my hair is a dead giveaway . He laughs and bats my hand down as he stops me in front of one woman and three men . Jesse bends his body so our eyes are level . ‘
154333	154348	154267	154267	I	363	’ I look at him and he winks . It ’s bitterly endearing and I ’m
154361	154368	154369	154369	I	363	‘ What about the other stuff ? ’
154391	154407	154408	154408	He	1748	‘ I do n’t share you with anyone , Ava . Not even their eyes . ’
154534	154539	154533	154533	I	363	’m certain that what I ’m
154732	154888	154729	154729	He	431	’m affected . I cringe and look back to the scene , willing my body to behave . Now the third man has joined in and is stroking and rubbing between her thighs . Oh hell ! The slickness of her is making his fingers slide with ease over the outer edges of her entrance . He withdraws his hand to reach up and run his wet fingers across her bottom lip , and her tongue darts out , lapping up the wetness . His fingers fall to her chin and then begin a slow trail down the centre of her body before reaching her sex . She bucks in response to his touch , letting out a cry of frustration as he removes his hand . He lays his free arm across her stomach to prevent her movements and then plunges two fingers into her , smiling at her attempts to struggle free . I ’m
154917	155219	155233	155233	she	1761	’m shocked to feel hugely turned on . She is being showered with attention from these men and their only pleasure is her pleasure . I know Jesse ’s eyes are on me again , I ca n’t look at him . Just then , the guy at her thighs nods to the two men on her breasts – a silent signal – and they all release her from their touch . She yells at the loss of contact , but then cries out as her legs are pushed up , her knees apart and a mouth is slammed on her swelling folds . I cross my legs as I stand , then feel Jesse ’s hand relax around mine before squeezing hard . Another of the men takes her mouth in a greedy claim while the last man goes back to her breasts . His hands cup both mounds , teasing and petting , while his tongue runs a trail between them , before he finally divides the attention of his tongue between each one at steady interludes . Each of the men frequently gaze up to her face and each time they are rewarded with a look of pure satisfaction , which seems to embolden them . She is being worshipped by three magnificent males and you would have to be a nun for it not to turn you on . Swiftly , her body noticeably tenses – a visual display that she is about to orgasm . I tense on the spot too . The attention increases as they get the signal she is close and everything suddenly becomes urgent . The man at her mouth catches her moans with his hard kiss and her knees spread further to give the man between her thighs better access . They ’re

155581	155593	155594	155594	I	363	’ he whispers as his chest concaves on a deep breath . ‘
155605	155614	155594	155594	I	363	’ He kisses the top of my head . ‘
155625	155658	155618	155618	I	363	’ He breaks away and tucks me under his arm to head for the door . After watching all of that , he wants to dance with me ? He leans down . ‘
155670	155685	155659	155659	I	363	’ he says softly . My breath catches and I hear him laugh quietly . ‘
155690	155871	155659	155659	I	363	’ he reminds me . Not that I need reminding . I glance over my shoulder and come to an abrupt , shocked halt . I watch as the woman is flipped over onto her hands and knees and one man slams into the back of her as another one of the men kneels in front of her . He trusts himself straight into her mouth , silencing her shocked yelps . My eyes widen at the sudden change in approach . They both pump into her , one at each end of her body , and the third man starts circling the kneeling mass of bodies . What the hell is he going to do ? Oh no ! I watch in horror as the third man collects something from the nearby cabinet and then lowers himself to the floor on his knees at the back of her . The other man pulls out and spreads her cheeks , giving him access to her arse . I need to walk away . I need to leave now , but I ’m

156059	156065	156066	156066	He	1768	‘ Do n’t , Ava . ’
156079	156094	156095	156095	I	363	’m thinking . The inadequacy has returned , harder , more forcefully than before . ‘
156100	156111	156095	156095	I	363	’ he says , still refusing to meet my eyes . ‘
156114	156115	156116	156116	I	363	’ ‘
156122	156205	156206	156206	You	363	’ He carries on leading me , and I choose not to push for anymore , not that I ’d get an answer . I ca n’t think of him like that . As we reach the door , Natasha intercepts our escape . She ’s naked , except for a microscopic pair of satin knickers , her boobs jiggling all over the place as she comes to a stop in front of us . I do n’t know where to look . ‘
156207	156214	156215	156215	she	1773	’re a bit overdressed , Jesse . ’
156268	156276	156277	156277	he	431	‘ Have some fucking respect , Natasha . ’
156313	156323	156324	156324	I	363	‘ I would like to send a memo too . ’
156358	156365	156355	156355	He	431	‘ Whatever you want , Ava . ’

156448	156451	156452	156452	I	363	‘ Please . ’
156453	156464	156452	156452	I	363	’m trying not to sound hurt , but I know I ’m
156494	156513	156493	156493	I	363	’m regretting it too . This has not helped me in attempting to deal with Jesse ’s history . ‘
156522	156551	156516	156516	you	1784	’ I ask . He knew what I was going to see . I do n’t know what I was expecting , but it certainly was n’t that . ‘
156562	156571	156552	156552	You	1784	’ He ’s right . I do . I ’m
156619	156629	156609	156609	I	363	‘ I never want to go up there again . ’
156630	156636	156637	156637	he	431	‘ Then you wo n’t . ’
156641	156653	156654	156654	I	363	‘ And I never want you to go up there either . ’
156655	156674	156654	156654	I	363	’m being unreasonable by asking him to avoid the epicenter of his business . He studies me carefully . ‘
156701	156714	156693	156693	I	363	’ I nod my head , my eyes darting across his body . ‘
156718	156754	156693	156693	I	363	’ I say quietly , feeling guilty for making such a demand and even guiltier that he ’s submitted with no questions , arguments or challenging . He pushes my hair from my face gently . ‘
156765	156766	156755	156755	You	363	’ ‘
156769	156770	156755	156755	You	363	’ ‘
156773	156854	156755	156755	You	363	’ He turns me around , sending me on my way . I make my way through to the summer room , avoiding the toilets , even though I could do with a wee . The dance floor is busy and I spy Kate immediately , her red hair a beacon in the crowd . I step onto the dance floor as Otis Reading ’s Love Man kicks in and Kate screams , thrilled at my arrival and the track . ‘
156860	156867	156755	156755	You	363	’ she yells over the music . ‘
156875	157072	156755	156755	You	363	’ I shrug , but then the hideous thought of Kate up there stamps all over my mind . Oh God no ! Her big blues widen in astonishment , and then her pale face breaks out in a big grin . This does not assist in ridding my head of such unbearably awful thoughts . She grabs my hand and I grasp my dress so I can join her . Sam and Drew are very well oiled and performing some pretty criminal moves as they attract the attention of many women on the dance floor . Kate does n’t seem to mind . She keeps her hand in mine and rolls her eyes at her wayward fellow and his cheeky grin . She is as laidback and unthreatened as ever , but Sam , it would seem , is not so . He soon yanks her away from a man dancing a bit too close for his liking . I jump and have a mild panic attack when a back presses up against mine , but his smell soon invades me and I turn my face into the chin that is resting on my shoulder . ‘
157079	157080	157081	157081	You	983	’ ‘

157096	157100	157081	157081	You	983	’ he asks . ‘
157104	157119	157120	157120	I	363	’ I ca n’t help but smile at him . He smiles straight back . ‘
157121	157128	157129	157129	He	363	’m going to dirty you up . ’
157188	157251	157187	157187	we	1790	’re in sync and in time to the band , who are doing an amazing rendition of the famous track . I throw my head back on a laugh when his arm appears suspended at the side , drifting up and down as he grinds his hips into mine , our circling speeding up and slowing in unison to the beat as I ’m
157385	157393	157394	157394	he	363	‘ Oh God , I love you . ’
157446	157450	157440	157440	Kate	431	‘ More dancing ? ’
157468	157471	157472	157472	I	363	‘ Drink . ’

157495	157542	157494	157494	We	1796	’re the only ones in an embrace as everyone around us gets down to the current offering from the band . Jesse ’s right ; they are really very good . He runs his nose up the side of my face and then circles it slowly . ‘
157547	157548	157494	157494	We	1796	’ ‘
157551	157584	157494	157494	We	1796	’ I do n’t hesitate . That is the easiest question I ’ve ever had to answer . I pull him closer to me . There is too much space between us . ‘
157592	157647	157494	157494	We	1796	’ He pushes his face into my neck and breathes in deeply , and I smile in pure and utter bliss as he holds me tight , cocooning me in his arms . I ’ve never been so happy , and I know I never will be . I can deal with his past . ‘
157655	157668	157669	157669	God	81	’ I say quietly . I feel him grin against my neck . ‘
157672	157681	157669	157669	God	81	’ he says , releasing me under duress . ‘
157696	157719	157685	157685	I	363	’ He turns me in his arms and starts guiding me from the dance floor . As I reach the edge , I ’m
157997	158034	157996	157996	I	363	’m boiling inside at their audacity . I turn , pulling Jesse from the dance floor . I hear a few gasps and definitely a whoop from Kate , but I do n’t look back . I ’m
158044	158061	158043	158043	I	363	’m leading Jesse . This has absolutely never happened and it does n’t for long . I ’m

158085	158090	158092	158092	me	363	’ he says contentedly . ‘
158096	158157	158092	158092	me	363	’ I want to point out that I only trample when necessary , but that would be a pointless exercise if ever there was one . I link my arms at the base of his neck and drown in his mouth while feeling a whole lot of eyes on us . Maybe the memos wo n’t be required after all . ‘
158160	158223	158224	158224	Mario	175	’ He places me on my customary stool and waves Mario over , who produces my drink immediately from behind the bar , along with two bottles of water . I pick a bottle up and start swinging the water willingly before Jesse has the opportunity to demand it . He perches on the stool opposite and gives me an approving smile . ‘
158231	158266	158224	158224	Mario	175	’ he asks , as he stands back up and leans over the bar , running his eyes up the long row of endless glass doors . I glance over and see dwindling shelves . ‘
158279	158292	158269	158270	Mr Ward	340	’ He laughs as he removes some empty bottles from the optics . ‘

158314	158333	158311	158312	Good man	66	’ Jesse says , sitting back down on the stool and placing his foot on my stools footrest . ‘

158358	158362	158363	158363	I	363	’ He smiles . ‘
158364	158376	158377	158377	I	363	’m taking you home . It ’s been a long day . ’
158414	158420	158421	158421	he	564	‘ You good , girl ? ’
158441	158445	158446	158446	I	363	’m absolutely exhausted . ‘
158447	158456	158446	158446	I	363	’m taking her home . Everything okay upstairs ? ’
158457	158461	158462	158462	John	564	‘ S’all good , ’
158472	158476	158471	158471	I	363	’m yawning again . ‘
158488	158508	158513	158513	Kate	431	’ He gets his phone out and gives a few short , precise instructions before giving Jesse the nod . ‘
158515	158558	158509	158509	I	363	’ I manage to mumble through my tired state . I go to lower myself from the stool but Jesse places his hand on my knee to stop me . John performs that deep baritone laugh that reverberates through your entire being . ‘
158572	158583	158561	158561	I	363	’ Oh ? Jesse joins John in his amused state . ‘

158597	158652	158585	158585	you	431	’ I know my face is screwed up in disgust and they laugh harder . Copping a load of Kate and Sam in the act ? No , thank you . Oh God , will anyone else be joining them ? Where ’s Drew ? I frantically shake my stray , uninvited thoughts away . ‘
158657	158727	158729	158729	my	363	’ I shudder and drop onto my tired feet . All things considered , these shoes are incredibly comfortable , considering I ’ve been in them for over seven hours . Jesse and John exchange a few words , but my brain wo n’t allow my ears to listen . I do , however , home in on him telling John not to expect him in tomorrow which means I ’m

158940	158947	158931	158931	He	1818	’m so glad I let him . ‘
158952	158983	158984	158985	Mr Ward	340	’ I feel the vibrations of Jesse ’s voice drift into my body , which is secured firmly to his chest . I ca n’t believe how tired I am . ‘

He grasps it , drawing it slowly down my back , and then pushes it off my shoulders . I step out and then fall back against his chest . ‘
159260	159286	159250	159250	I	363	’ His appreciative voice wakes me slightly as his palms smooth down my sides over the delicate lace of my corset and onto my hips . ‘

159293	159329	159250	159250	I	363	’ I start walking towards the bathroom with his palms resting on my waist . He lifts me onto the vanity unit and loads my brush up with toothpaste before running it under a tap . ‘
159332	159413	159250	159250	I	363	’ he orders , and I let my mouth drop open , giving him access to my teeth . He sets about brushing them with care , circling slowly and patiently while he holds my jaw . His concentration frown is set firmly in place and his eyes are shimmering with contentment , and I know it ’s because he ’s undertaking a task of his self - appointed job ; looking after me . He pulls the brush out . ‘

159561	159569	159570	159570	He	2607	’m not going to take you tonight . ’
159588	159607	159587	159587	I	363	’m the brazen hussy . He pulls back and gives me a stern look on an arched brow . ‘

He steps back and starts undressing himself as he nods towards the bed . I clamber in and settle down , my earlier tiredness returning as soon as my head hits the pillow . Jesse climbs in and lets me crawl onto his chest where I ’m

160165	160204	160164	160164	I	363	’m not sure my Mum and Dad will see past his obvious need to smother me and control me . They will see it as unhealthy , but is it unhealthy if you accept it ? Not because you ’re
160257	160265	160256	160256	I	363	’m not deluded enough to think that I ’m
160310	160333	160309	160309	I	363	’m not sure that Jesse ’s fear is an unreasonable one – not with my developing knowledge of his history . Chapter 24 ‘
160337	160441	160309	160309	I	363	’ I open my eyes to an invasion of natural light , my hearing invaded by the erotic music I remember from the communal room . Jesse ’s handsome face is floating above mine and he has his morning stubble . He looks delicious . I shift my arms in an attempt to grab hold of him , but they go nowhere . What the hell ? His face breaks out into his dark , roguish grin , and I know immediately what he ’s done . I lift my eyes and find my hands are cuffed to the headboard of the bed . ‘
160449	160475	160309	160309	I	363	’ he asks . I return my eyes to his and find them hooded , his long lashes fanned . I should have anticipated this . ‘
160483	160495	160496	160496	We	1838	’ My morning voice is husky for more reasons than one . ‘

160529	160533	160534	160534	I	363	‘ Sleepy sex ? ’
160550	160554	160549	160549	I	363	’m not stupid . ‘

I do n’t remember bringing that home , but then again , I do n’t remember bringing myself home either . Jesse did , and he obviously brought that bag with us too . He straddles his naked body over my hips and sits the bag on my stomach . ‘
160656	160739	160561	160561	I	363	’ he muses as he puts his hand in . There is little point in asking me . I took one look at Kate ’s face when she opened hers and decided there and then that I did n’t want to know . I shift my hands a bit to try and get myself comfortable . Well , as comfortable as I can be with my arms spread and secured to a headboard by handcuffs . Jesse pulls out a gold vibrator . ‘
160746	160773	160561	160561	I	363	’ He looks at it with disgust , before tossing it over his shoulder . I hear it land with a thump on the bedroom floor . ‘
160779	160808	160561	160561	I	363	’ he asks himself . He pulls a small box out and throws that over his shoulder too , with an even more disgusted look on his face . ‘
160816	160817	160561	160561	I	363	’ ‘
160820	160859	160561	160561	I	363	’ I ask , but he completely ignores me and carries on rummaging through the bag . He pulls out a silver satin thong and gives it a thorough inspection before that gets tossed over his shoulder too . ‘
160863	160923	160561	160561	I	363	’ he mutters , returning to the bag . I look at him in slight amusement , straddled on my hips , a scowl firmly in place . He ’s not impressed . He pulls out a card , reads it and scoffs , before tearing it up and throwing it to join the other offenders on the floor . ‘
160928	160942	160561	160561	I	363	’ I ask , completely intrigued . He glances up at me briefly . ‘
160949	160953	160561	160561	I	363	’ he grumbles . ‘
160956	160957	160561	160561	I	363	’ ‘
160963	161002	160561	160561	I	363	’ he mutters . I laugh and he flicks me a devilish grin . Sarah definitely organised the party bags . I wish he had n’t of tore it up ; I would have donated it to her . ‘
161008	161031	160561	160561	I	363	’ he spits , before taking one last thing out and tossing the bag on the floor with the other criminal contents . ‘
161036	161057	160561	160561	I	363	’ he muses , holding up a black rubber ring attached to a small , metal , bullet type contraption . ‘
161064	161105	161106	161106	I	363	’ I blurt . He holds it up and runs his eyes over it before returning them to me . He smiles knowingly and leans forward , plumping a pillow under my head and kissing me chastely on the lips , ‘
161115	161165	161106	161106	I	363	’ he whispers , before returning to his position over my hips and lifting himself up to his knees . What is he doing ? He takes the black rubber loop and starts to slide it over his erection and it all , very swiftly , becomes very clear . ‘
161182	161192	161180	161180	you	1842	’ I yell irritably , but he ignores me . ‘
161195	161275	161180	161180	you	1842	’ I shout . He keeps his eyes on his hands as he rolls the loop to the base of his arousal and positions the bullet on his shaft . I huff and throw my head back onto the pillow , looking up at the ceiling . I want to do that ! Even with my eyes off the God like creature straddling me , all I can think of are all things erotic with this music surrounding me . ‘
161280	161317	161180	161180	you	1842	’ he demands , but I keep my eyes firmly pointing upwards . I feel the mattress sink next to my head from his fist resting in it , then his other hand clasping my jaw . ‘
161320	161360	161365	161365	Ava	0	’ It ’s his tone that dares me to disobey . He shakes my jaw lightly , and I find my eyes falling down to his . They are bright pools of green lust and his lips are parted . ‘
161367	161404	161365	161365	Ava	0	’ He lowers his head and I raise mine to get him on me without delay . He attacks my mouth with urgency , delving in with his tongue and moaning in satisfaction . I know I ’m
161448	161453	161454	161454	he	1843	‘ You will watch . ’
161461	161467	161454	161454	he	1843	‘ Turn the music off ! ’
161487	161495	161475	161475	He	1843	‘ Why ? Are you feeling horny ? ’
161574	161577	161578	161578	he	1843	‘ Open ! ’
161654	161656	161646	161646	mine	363	‘ You ’re
161659	161720	161646	161646	mine	363	’ I moan as I look up into a very satisfied stare . He ’s getting revenge all right . He rises to his knees and fists his erection with one hand , flicking the switch of the bullet - like contraption with the other . I hear the steady pulse of a vibration kick in and his mouth parts . ‘
161723	161738	161646	161646	mine	363	’ he mouths . I close my eyes for the briefest of seconds before I ’m
161839	161861	161866	161866	baby	0	’m helpless . His fist flexes as he draws back , pulling his foreskin and revealing his glistening , moist head . ‘
161868	161880	161866	161866	baby	0	’ His voice is husky and it spikes at my groin . ‘
161889	161901	161903	161903	you	0	’ My gaze travels back up his body to his eyes . ‘
161905	161934	161903	161903	you	0	’ I say quietly and calmly . I do n’t care about my blue language . It ’s not like he can punish me any worse than this . ‘
161937	161954	161955	161955	You	0	’ He forces the word out on a moan , and I wriggle with the cuffs . ‘
161965	162019	161960	161960	Ava	0	’ he hisses through a broken voice , his fist still slowly gliding over his solid length . Maybe if I fight enough , he ’ll free me . He ’ll get worried about injuring me . It ’s common knowledge of his unreasonable worry regarding my safety . I wriggle some more . ‘
162022	162082	161960	161960	Ava	0	’ he barks , and suddenly his strokes are picking up speed . This is absolutely killing me , but good God does he look incredible on his knees above me , working himself . I watch as every muscle on his chest , his arms and his thighs tense further and the vein in his neck jumps out . ‘
162085	162095	161960	161960	Ava	0	’ I beg . I need to touch him . ‘
162104	162108	161960	161960	Ava	0	’ he asks . ‘
162122	162123	162124	162124	I	363	’ ‘
162135	162153	162127	162127	Jesse	431	’ I clench my eyes shut , screaming in my head to block the loud music out . ‘

162165	162182	162159	162159	Ava	0	’ My head starts thrashing from side to side . This is the worse torture . I ’m
162225	162228	162229	162229	His	431	‘ Please ! ’
162238	162243	162244	162244	he	431	‘ You ’ll watch . ’
162256	162259	162244	162244	he	431	‘ Fuck ! ’
162286	162291	162292	162292	he	431	‘ Open your mouth . ’
162300	162327	162330	162330	Jesus	155	’m bid immediately and without a second ’s hesitation . He braces his free hand on the headboard and pistons back and forth with his fist . ‘
162332	162532	162533	162533	I	363	’ His head drops as he guides himself into my waiting mouth and spills himself all over my tongue , the saltiness of him sliding down my throat . I take the opportunity to wrap my lips around him and get some contact . His chest heaves as he slowly works himself down , the vibrations from the bullet traveling down his length and tickling my lips as I lick and lap at him . His cock twitches on my tongue and I roll , lap and suck to my heart ’s content while he shakes above me , attempting to stabilise his breathing . He drags his eyes open and looks down at me before his body is shifting and the vibrating stops , the little ping of elastic and small thud telling me the contraption has been relegated to the floor . He cradles himself between my thighs and gazes down at me , his face thoughtful as he strokes the exposed underside of my arms . Is n’t he going to let me go ? The erotic tones of Enigma are still flooding my hearing and it ’s not helping with my pre - exploded state . ‘
162541	162556	162533	162533	I	363	’ He drops his lips to mine and sweeps his tongue through my mouth . ‘
162571	162572	162533	162533	I	363	’ ‘
162586	162603	162573	162573	I	363	’ I mumble into his mouth . He ’s not so unreasonable to handcuff me permanently . ‘
162611	162612	162573	162573	I	363	’ ‘
162629	162630	162573	162573	I	363	’ ‘
162639	162659	162573	162573	I	363	’ He trails his lips up my face and back down , plunging his tongue back into my mouth . ‘
162664	162714	162716	162716	me	363	’ WHAT ? I very nearly bite his tongue off in shock . He continues taking my mouth , like he has n’t just said that after he ’s ejaculated into my mouth and has me restrained . He eventually pulls back and looks down at my stunned face . ‘
162718	162723	162716	162716	me	363	’ he demands softly . ‘
162732	162738	162739	162739	I	363	’m handcuffed to the bed ! ’
162773	162783	162784	162784	he	155	‘ Does someone need some sense fucking into them ? ’
162796	162834	162795	162795	I	363	’m completely stunned . He ca n’t fuck a yes out of me for this ! I inwardly laugh because he absolutely could and he probably would . He pulls back , drops his eyes and sighs . ‘
162846	162935	162936	162936	You	1849	’ He starts chewing his lip and the cogs start whirling around in that beautiful mind of his . He eventually looks back at me , and I try to rid my face of its fixed stunned expression . It ’s hard . He ’s cuffed me to the bed , masturbated on me , come in my mouth and then demanded I marry him ? This man really is crazy mad . I lay beneath him , absolutely astounded , no obvious replies popping into my head . ‘
162951	162959	162960	162960	His	363	’m totally addicted to you , baby . ’
162977	162985	162967	162967	My	363	‘ You own me . Marry me . ’
163063	163103	163062	163062	I	363	’m twenty six years old , he ’s thirty seven . Why am I thinking about our age difference now ? It ’s never mattered before . What I should be more concerned about is his challenging ways . I ’m
163143	163146	163131	163131	he	431	‘ Okay . ’
163195	163197	163198	163198	my	363	‘ You ’re
163201	163270	163198	163198	my	363	’ I add , just to reinforce my love for him . I want to be stuck to him forever , even with all of his challenging ways . I love him . I need him . The stunned expression that was riddling my face has now made its way onto Jesse ’s , and the cogs are spinning so fast I can see them beginning to smoke . ‘
163273	163278	163198	163198	my	363	’ he asks quietly . ‘
163283	163291	163198	163198	my	363	’ I shrug and then realise that I ’m
163298	163311	163312	163312	He	1852	‘ No sense fuck required . Can you let me go now ? ’
163351	163356	163350	163350	I	363	’m soon disturbed when I ’m
163467	163476	163477	163477	I	363	’m not going anywhere – not ever now . ‘
163478	163486	163487	163487	His	1852	’m going to make you so happy . ’
163525	163528	163529	163529	You	1852	’re glazed . ‘
163535	163553	163524	163524	They	1855	’ I smooth his face and wipe my thumb under his eye , collecting a stray tear . ‘
163559	163587	163524	163524	They	1855	’ I battle the quiver in my throat that has my own voice unsteady . He shakes his head mildly and rubs frantic palms over his face . ‘
163595	163616	163524	163524	They	1855	’ He reaches up to clasp my face and brings it down to his , resting his forehead on mine . ‘
163622	163632	163633	163633	mine	363	’re in my life , I ca n’t believe you ’re
163646	163665	163635	163635	You	1852	’ His eyes dart across my face and his hands smooth across my cheeks , as if ensuring I ’m

163676	163700	163703	163703	friends	490	’ I say quietly . I hope he comprehends how precious . He ’s everything … my complete world . He smiles mildly . ‘

163709	163715	163703	163703	friends	490	’ I return his smile . ‘
163724	163744	163703	163703	friends	490	’ He rolls us over so he ’s cradled between my thighs , and then slowly sinks into me . ‘
163753	163766	163703	163703	friends	490	’ He reaches for the remote control and turns the music off . ‘
163779	163810	163703	163703	friends	490	’ He drops his mouth and moans as I accept his lips and he grabs my hands , holding them above my head . He rears back and pushes forward . ‘
163817	163915	163703	163703	friends	490	’ I say around his mouth , and I feel him smile against my lips , but he does n’t say anything , or reprimand me on my language . He just seeps in and out at the most dreamy pace , plunging deeply , swiveling his hips gently and pulling back . My earlier blissful state is re - captured as the coils reload and prepare to release , his leisurely drives and grinding hips working their usual magic on my body . He pulls back from my mouth , carrying on with his luscious thrusts . ‘
163922	163936	163937	163937	I	363	’ His minty breath heats my face as he gazes down at me . ‘
163940	163946	163947	163947	You	1859	’ That will be strange . ‘

163959	163990	163991	163991	I	363	’ That ship has long sailed . He clenches his eyes shut as I feel the hints of his imminent orgasm thumping inside me , pushing my own climax forward . ‘
163992	164006	164007	164007	He	363	’m going to worship you every day for the rest of my life . ’
164011	164014	164007	164007	He	363	‘ Jesus ! ’

164198	164225	164226	164226	I	363	’m astride his waist . I place my hands on his chest and he covers them with his as I lazily circle my hips on him . ‘

164373	164376	164377	164377	He	363	‘ Sorry . ’

164443	164467	164470	164470	I	363	‘ She ’s the wife of the nasty little fucker who got ejected from The Manor the day you found the communal room . ’

164654	164695	164653	164653	I	363	’m not so surprised that she fell in love with him . It ’s her surprise visit to The Manor last night and the amount of time Jesse was in his office with her that I want to know about . ‘
164710	164723	164724	164724	She	1864	’ He takes a deep breath and pins me with determined eyes . ‘

164927	164967	164916	164916	I	363	‘ Mike ’s playing games . He advised the immigration police that half of my staff are illegal immigrants . It was cleared up quite quickly , no harm done . It was just a bit of an inconvenience . ’
164968	164986	164987	164987	He	201	‘ Why did n’t you just tell me all of this instead of letting my mind race ? ’
164990	165001	164987	164987	He	201	‘ Why would I trouble you with that trivial shit ? ’
165044	165058	165031	165031	he	201	‘ So , you took part in the threesome and that was it ? ’

My dark hair is a mass of ruffled waves , my eyes bright , lips pink and cheeks flushed . I look well . I absentmindedly grab my toothbrush and slap some paste on it while considering how well I feel too . I ’ve never felt so refreshed and alive and there is only one reason why that is and it ’s called Mr Challenging . Bloody hell , Kate ’s going to have kittens , and I ca n’t even begin to think what my parents are going to make of all this . After Matt , Mum told me not to get swallowed up by the first man who showed me a bit of attention . I ca n’t imagine she ’s going to be delighted that , in actual fact , I ’m
166961	166984	166985	166985	Jesse	431	’m face to face and being blinded by a dirty great big diamond , sitting loud and proud on my ring finger . ‘

I let him do his thing and thread my fingers through his hair , gaping again when my eyes fall on the ring . I ca n’t believe he put it on before he asked me , the arrogant arse . How did I not notice it ? Distracted … challenged . ‘
167727	167734	167736	167736	we	1896	’ He kisses his mark chastely . ‘

I belong with Jesse , it just is . How crazy . I resume teeth brushing duties , have a quick shower and shave before grabbing his dress shirt from the floor and putting it on with some jersey shorts . I cross the landing and remember the post that I ’ve still not given to Jesse . Taking a quick detour to the cream room , I grab the post from the unit before taking the stairs , ignoring the fact that I have been away from him for twenty minutes - ish and I miss him already . I find him in the kitchen with his finger in a jar of peanut butter while he looks intently at the screen of his laptop . I perform my usual look of disgust at the jar of peanut butter and my usual swoon at this beautiful man , before sitting myself on the stool opposite him . ‘

The thought of introducing Jesse to my parents fills me with dread , and what do I tell them he does for a living ? His suggestion of telling them that he owns a hotel wo n’t wash forever .

169494	169500	169501	169501	I	363	‘ I do n’t know . ’
169573	169581	169582	169582	He	1910	‘ You did n’t just do that . ’
169594	169601	169602	169602	he	1910	‘ Ava , open the door . ’
169617	169641	169610	169610	His	1910	‘ Ava , you know how it makes me feel if I ca n’t lay my hands on you . Open the door . ’
169642	169654	169660	169660	He	1910	‘ No , tell me we can discuss our wedding reasonably . ’
169655	169659	169660	169660	He	1910	‘ We were . ’
169670	169679	169660	169660	He	1910	‘ Ava , please , open the door . ’
169680	169713	169610	169610	His	1910	‘ No , we were n’t discussing it , Jesse . You were telling me how it ’s going to be . You ’ve really never had a relationship , have you ? ’
169714	169723	169610	169610	His	1910	‘ No . I ’ve told you this . ’
169724	169730	169660	169660	He	1910	‘ I can tell . You ’re
169735	169745	169746	169746	I	363	’ His anxious , green eyes flip to mine . ‘
169750	169760	169746	169746	I	363	’ he says softly , like that explains everything . ‘
169767	169768	169746	169746	I	363	’ ‘
169773	169858	169859	169859	I	363	’ I ask . I ’ve never had this power over him . I know how much he hates not being able to get to me and this is taking advantage of his weakness , but it ’s the only weakness I know , so if I have to use it , then I will , especially for something of this magnitude . His teeth are going ten to the dozen on his bottom lip as he mulls over my demand . He sighs . ‘
169866	169901	169902	169902	I	363	’ He grasps the handle , but then I think of something else – something that will have cause for another countdown later . I may as well kill two birds with one stone . ‘
169903	169910	169911	169911	I	363	’m going out with Kate later . ’
169925	169928	169915	169915	His	363	‘ What ? ’
169929	169944	169945	169945	I	363	‘ Last night , I told you that I was going out with Kate . ’
169949	169956	169945	169945	I	363	‘ And ? Open the door . ’
169957	169970	169915	169915	His	363	‘ You ca n’t stop me from seeing my friend . If I ’m

170152	170178	170179	170179	He	1544	’m not opening that door until you start being more reasonable . If you want to marry me , then you need to loosen up . ’
170185	170188	170179	170179	He	1544	’m stupid . ‘

170248	170285	170225	170225	I	363	’ Oh yes , I should be challenging him on that too , but I think I have probably given him enough heart attacks for one morning . He looks besides himself which is ridiculous – I ’m

170365	170384	170360	170360	he	431	’m suddenly riddled with guilt . His anxiety on this matter is one of his most unreasonable parts . ‘

170404	170424	170425	170425	I	363	’ I try and placate him as I stroke his back , feeling his heart hammering against my chest . ‘

170620	170624	170625	170625	I	363	‘ Absolutely not ! ’
170628	170631	170632	170632	He	363	‘ Why ? ’
170636	170646	170632	170632	He	363	‘ So you can keep an eye on me ? ’
170647	170663	170596	170596	He	363	‘ It ’s logical . You can have a drink , I can make sure you ’re

170751	170755	170756	170756	he	363	‘ Impossible woman . ’
170767	170778	170779	170779	I	363	’m placed on my feet and given a chaste kiss . ‘

170874	170885	170886	170886	he	363	‘ Charging on the side . Do n’t be long . ’

170926	170936	170937	170937	I	363	‘ No , tired . What time is it ? ’
170943	170946	170937	170937	I	363	‘ Eleven . ’
170947	170950	170951	170951	she	1921	‘ Shit ! ’
170963	170970	170973	170973	Ava	0	‘ Samuel , you loser . I ’m
170976	170992	170973	170973	Ava	0	’m supposed to be in Chelsea delivering a cake ! I ’ll call you later . ’
170993	171002	171003	171003	I	363	‘ Hey , are we still out tonight ? ’
171012	171021	171022	171022	she	1921	‘ Of course . Are you still allowed ? ’
171025	171036	171022	171022	she	1921	‘ Yes ! I ’ll be at yours at seven . ’
171037	171044	171045	171045	I	363	‘ Brill ! See you then . ’
171139	171303	171304	171304	Ava	0	’m back in Denmark temporarily . I will be in touch upon my return to re - arrange our meeting . My stomach flies up to my mouth , choking me , and my phone starts to shake in my hand . What the hell am I going to do ? I do n’t even consider advising Jesse of this . He ’ll spiral into meltdown , without a doubt . I delete the message immediately , knowing Jesse ’s bad phone manners will have him finding it . I do n’t reply either . At least I ’ve got a bit more time to figure this out and to speak to Patrick . How long will he be gone ? How long have I got to prepare for that meeting ? I contemplate texting him back to tell him I already know about his wife and Jesse , but then the intercom shrieks again , startling me . I answer to Clive . ‘
171322	171539	171540	171540	Ava	0	’ I do n’t have a chance to ask what it is or who it ’s from . Clive hangs up . I walk back into the kitchen , apprehensive and nervous , and start scrolling through my phone , searching for the PIN facility so I can prevent Jesse from intercepting any more messages that Mikael might send . He ’s going to get so suspicious when he finds it ’s got a lock on it , but I would rather deal with his slighted state than deal with a six foot three inch whirlwind flying through the penthouse . He knows that his bad phone manners annoy me , so it should n’t be very difficult to brush this off . I have no other choice . I make my way to the door . I ’ll deal with this on Monday morning when Jesse is n’t within such close proximity of me and my phone . Until then , I need to put on an unaffected , relaxed face , and I really must speak to Patrick . I open the door and hear the elevator arrive , then the unmistakable sound of Clive grumbling . Curiously walking towards the elevator , I find Clive heaving box after box and bag after bag . ‘
171565	171569	171570	171570	Urh	58	’ he huffs . ‘
171574	171591	171570	171570	Urh	58	’ I look and see Harrods bags and gift boxes everywhere . What the hell ? I ’m
171690	171701	171675	171675	Clive	76	‘ That ’s your lot . Was there anything left ? ’
171711	171714	171715	171715	He	58	‘ Pardon ? ’
171720	171731	171715	171715	He	58	‘ At the store , did you buy them out ? ’
171732	171741	171752	171752	Clive	76	‘ Urhhh , yeah . Thanks , Clive . ’
171742	171751	171752	171752	Clive	76	‘ Oh , a young lady stopped by . ’
171778	171781	171782	171782	I	363	‘ Really ? ’
171791	171799	171800	171800	He	76	‘ Urm … I do n’t know … ’
171805	171821	171822	171822	He	76	‘ Actually , maybe it was for a different resident . Ca n’t be sure . ’
171826	171832	171822	171822	He	76	‘ It ’s my age . ’
171833	171844	171845	171845	I	363	‘ Yeah , whatever , Clive . Short black hair ? ’
171874	171882	171890	171890	him	76	‘ Ca n’t be sure , Ava . ’
171903	171913	171892	171894	The poor man	76	‘ Let ’s keep this quiet , shall we ? ’
171914	171917	171918	171918	He	76	‘ Oh ? ’
171922	171946	171947	171947	He	76	‘ Yes , you do n’t tell Jesse about the young woman , and I wo n’t tell anyone about our neighbours habits . ’
171985	172005	171984	171984	I	363	’m not telling Jesse . I do n’t want him contacting Coral , helping her , seeing her . I ’m
172099	172103	172104	172104	Coral	183	’m a hypocrite . ‘
172106	172125	172126	172126	Coral	183	’ I say , evenly and clearly . There is silence , but she does n’t hang up . ‘
172133	172134	172126	172126	Coral	183	’ ‘
172139	172147	172152	172152	she	183	’ Her voice is small , and I ’m
172184	172200	172201	172201	He	1930	’m aware , I do n’t know , but she ’s certainly got some balls . ‘
172212	172224	172208	172208	I	363	’ I sound polite , but with an edge of irritation . ‘
172234	172245	172246	172246	Coral	183	’ She does n’t sound polite . She sounds affronted . ‘
172255	172273	172274	172274	Ava	0	’ I need to make myself clear here , seeming as Jesse has suddenly grown a conscience . ‘
172280	172285	172274	172274	Ava	0	’ she asks . I ’m
172293	172298	172290	172290	her	0	‘ That ’s right . ’
172324	172345	172346	172346	She	0	‘ Ava , he ’ll make you need him , then abandon you . Walk away while you still can . ’
172598	172618	172597	172597	I	363	’m going nowhere . Sliding his phone on the counter , I walk back into the living space and I ’m
172688	172740	172687	172687	I	363	’m becoming neurotic and challenging as well . He brings out the worst in me , and I know damn well I bring out the worst in him . John said as much . Easygoing , laidback Jesse Ward ? No such man exists . Well , he does , when I ’m
172916	173088	173091	173091	baby	0	’m sat in the middle of the floor , surrounded by a mass of clothes , shoes , bags and accessories . Every single item I tried on is here , except for the gown – all of the likes , the no ’s , the maybes and a whole lot more that I did n’t try . I know there must be a mistake because even the slate Chloe dress is here , and Jesse would never have willingly bought that for me . I do love it , though . Oh God ! I flop back onto the floor and gaze up at the high ceilings of the penthouse . This is just way too much ; the gown , the necklace , the ring , and now all of this . I am completely overwhelmed and feeling a bit suffocated . I do n’t want all of this stuff . I just want him , without the history , without the other women and without Mikael poking about . ‘
173093	173106	173091	173091	baby	0	’ Jesse ’s wet , handsome face appears , floating above me . ‘
173118	173163	173091	173091	baby	0	’ He pouts . I scoff and signal in the general direction of the designer jumble sale surrounding me . Can he not see it all ? He looks around , completely unfazed by the piles and piles of women ’s wear flanking me . ‘
173168	173200	173091	173091	baby	0	’ he says coolly . I make a dramatic display of throwing my arms back in exasperation , and he exhales to match my drama before lying down next to me . ‘
173205	173227	173091	173091	baby	0	’ he orders softly . I turn my face to his and get an injection of his fresh , minty breath . ‘
173233	173234	173091	173091	baby	0	’ ‘
173240	173244	173245	173245	I	363	’ I complain . ‘
173250	173260	173261	173261	I	363	’ He smiles , his eyes twinkling with pleasure . ‘
173262	173283	173261	173261	I	363	’m glad , but I ’ve never had anyone to share my money with , Ava . Please humour me . ’
173284	173289	173261	173261	I	363	‘ People will think I ’m
173296	173311	173312	173312	I	363	’ I say it as it is . I ’ve already encountered the accusation . ‘
173328	173341	173343	173343	him	363	’ He twists onto his side and pulls at my hip so I ’m
173345	173351	173343	173343	him	363	‘ Now , shut up . ’
173352	173368	173369	173369	I	363	‘ You wo n’t have any money left if you spend like you did yesterday . ’

173399	173403	173404	173404	I	363	‘ Make me . ’
173577	173643	173576	173576	I	363	’m looking forward to it and Jesse has got to learn to share me . I finish my hair and turn the dryer off to hear heaving , huffing and puffing coming from the bed . He ’s behaving like a schoolboy , so I ignore it and make my way into the bathroom to cream up and get my make - up on . I ’m
173771	173815	173770	173770	I	363	’m seized and slung onto the bed , minus one towel . I should have known ; he ’s going to trample me and mark me and send me out with his scent all over me . He ’s done this before . I ’m
173838	173844	173845	173845	he	1944	‘ You wo n’t come . ’
173897	173907	173908	173908	he	1944	‘ This is for my pleasure , not yours . ’
173950	173963	173964	173964	He	1944	‘ Relax , Ava . I do n’t want to hurt you . ’
173992	173995	173996	173996	he	1944	‘ Relax ! ’
174019	174080	174018	174018	I	363	’m fighting the inevitable that will be Jesse abandoning me before I explode . I do n’t want to go out this evening full of pent up pressure in my groin . I want to be sated and relaxed and he can do that . The bloody arse ! I feel him position himself at my opening . I whimper . ‘
174086	174093	174084	174084	Ava	0	’ His tone is full of aggravation ‘

174133	174139	174131	174131	baby	0	’ He slaps my backside . ‘

174148	174183	174144	174144	I	363	’ The sting radiates through me from his swift collide , and he yells in frustration at my non - conformity as he reaches underneath me to brush his fingers over my pulsing centre . ‘
174186	174250	174144	174144	I	363	’ I relax instantly as the connection of his heated touch blasts my senses and rockets me forward , flicking the switch that he has a direct link to . A sea of intense pleasure drowns me and I start a hasty build up towards a furious climax . I try and grab it and keep hold , but he withdraws his fingers . ‘
174253	174260	174144	174144	I	363	’ I shout , completely frustrated . ‘
174265	174315	174318	174318	Jesse	431	’ His fingers re - enter me , sweeping through me , his thumb skimming across the very tip of my clitoris , prompting me to push back in a desperate attempt to try and capture more friction . He pulls out , spreading the moisture up my crease . ‘
174320	174331	174318	174318	Jesse	431	’ I feel his solid cock pushing against my opening . ‘
174334	174335	174318	174318	Jesse	431	’ ‘
174342	174353	174340	174340	Ava	0	’ He advances , breaching me , slowly and controlled . ‘
174358	174387	174340	174340	Ava	0	’ I could cry with infuriation and frustration , but it does n’t stop me from pushing back , taking him all of the way . I know I ’m

174498	174505	174488	174488	I	363	‘ Brace yourself on the headboard . ’
174567	174575	174538	174538	He	363	‘ Do you have a good grip ? ’
174576	174579	174580	174580	I	363	‘ Yes ! ’
174594	174642	174646	174646	he	363	’m going to scream with frustration and he ’s not even done with me yet . Why the hell am I not stopping this ? I hear him suck in a sharp breath as he starts withdrawing from me , the fullness alleviating slightly , but then I ’m
174660	174667	174668	174668	He	363	‘ Brace your arms , Ava ! ’
174688	174693	174694	174694	I	363	‘ Jesse , please . ’
174697	174707	174708	174708	he	363	‘ It ’s feels good , does n’t it ? ’
174717	174720	174708	174708	he	363	‘ Yes . ’
174721	174735	174708	174708	he	363	‘ You love me taking you hard , do n’t you , Ava ? ’
174736	174739	174708	174708	he	363	‘ Yes ! ’
174740	174746	174747	174747	He	363	‘ I know you do , ’
174847	174855	174856	174856	he	363	‘ Oh , no you do n’t . ’
174924	174931	174932	174932	he	363	‘ Open your eyes , Ava ! ’
174948	174950	174951	174952	a bastard	1947	‘ You ’re

174964	174972	174951	174952	a bastard	1947	’m going to get so drunk tonight ! ’
174973	174977	174951	174952	a bastard	1947	‘ No , you ’re
174980	175087	174951	174952	a bastard	1947	’ He continues working himself over me as I watch , his eyes hooded and dark , his strained neck muscles bulging . I press my lips together . I will not be opening my mouth ! He falls forward , bracing his free hand on the bed and spills himself all over my breasts on a loud yell that resounds around the whole bedroom . He pants above me , slowing his strokes as I wriggle futilely . My breasts are coated in his warn cum , my hair is all over the place , my make - up probably needs re - doing and I ’m
175106	175113	175114	175114	he	363	‘ Do you want to come ? ’
175127	175129	175114	175114	he	363	‘ I ’m
175133	175155	175156	175157	Stubborn woman	1948	’ I bark , just to make it clear that I am not bargaining with him on this . No way ! ‘
175159	175182	175156	175157	Stubborn woman	1948	’ He reaches down and wipes his palm all over my chest , spreading himself over every square inch of my torso . ‘
175189	175270	175156	175157	Stubborn woman	1948	’ he says on a half - smile , before leaning down and pressing his lips hard on mine . My lips part involuntarily and I soak up the greedy lashes of his tongue , moaning , begging for more , but then he pulls back and I thrash my head from side to side , flipping myself onto my front . I hear him laugh , and then he slaps my arse hard before he gets off the bed . ‘
175275	175276	175277	175277	I	363	’ ‘
175283	175414	175277	175277	I	363	’ I yell to his back as he rearranges his boxers on his way out . I shout and thrash myself about on the bed for a few moments . I do n’t know what this is going to achieve , apart from messing my hair up some more and smudging my make - up further . I ca n’t believe he did that . What am I talking about ? Of course I can believe it . This man is beyond unreasonable and challenging . Right ! I jump off the bed and set about sorting myself out . My blow dried waves are now more of a tousled array of brunette and my cheeks are flushed . I look well and truly fucked , which is ironic because I ’m
175506	175526	175505	175505	I	363	’m heading straight out that door and with any luck , it will be a while before he notices I ’m

175570	175738	175741	175741	Clive	76	’ My legs instantly kick into gear at the sound of that fierce voice and I dash for the door , slamming it behind me to hinder his pursuit while praying the elevator is open . I thank all that is holy and dive in the lift , punching the code in frantically . The doors shut just as I see Jesse ’s raging face appear through the tiny gape . I give him a cheeky wave and turn to look at myself in the mirror . Okay , so the grey Chloe number is a bit on the racy side , but my legs look incredible , even if I do say so myself . He asked for this . The elevator door opens and I scurry across the marble floor , searching for my keys as I go . He ’s got to get some clothes on and wait for the elevator to get back up to the penthouse , so I should be fine . ‘
175743	175910	175741	175741	Clive	76	’ I sing , running past him and emerging into the evening air . I fire my key fob at my car and run across the car park . I hear him before I see him . I turn and watch as he flies out the foyer of Lusso , looking like the Devil himself . I clench my lips shut to suppress my laugh . He looks homicidal . He tears towards me , barefoot and gloriously naked , except for his fine , tight boxer shorts . I stay where I am . I knew I would n’t be going out in this dress , whether he caught me here or at the bar , I was always going to be hauled home in disgrace and dressed in something more suitable by Jesse ’s standards . He grabs me and flings me up onto his shoulder , reaching up to hold the hem of my dress down before taking me straight back into Lusso . ‘

176171	176224	176170	176170	I	363	’m not comfortable with this dirty great big rock sat on my finger as it is . The necklace added to the equation will tip me over the edge of nervousness . Kate comes barreling out of her house and Jesse gets out , letting her in the back of the car . ‘
176235	176246	176227	176227	I	363	’ she says as she gets comfortable in the back . ‘

176429	176451	176374	176374	me	363	’ I snort . If you call handcuffs and being forced to swallow romantic . I thrust my hand at her . ‘
176455	176474	176374	176374	me	363	’ She grabs my hand with both of hers and gets up close and personal with the diamond . ‘

176519	176553	176517	176517	Dad	3884	’ Kate has just innocently hit on two very sore subjects . We will be discussing the date of the wedding like grownups soon , and as for my parents ? Well , I ’m

176586	176604	176585	176585	I	363	’m not getting into this now . I turn back around in my seat to face Kate . ‘
176611	176616	176585	176585	I	363	’ I ask sweetly . ‘

176680	176686	176649	176649	I	363	’ Jesse laughs a little . ‘
176705	176737	176740	176741	my friend	1544	’ he clarifies . I gawk at him , and he flicks a raised brow at me . Do I need to blunt up ? Kate slaps him on the shoulder . ‘

177411	177515	177410	177410	I	363	’m facing an Olympic gold medal worthy interrogation from my parents and Dan . I do n’t need it from this lot too . Oh , Dan ’s back tomorrow . With all of the spectacular events of the last few days , it had slipped my mind . A wave of guilt washes over me for forgetting his return , but it ’s soon replaced with a twinge of excitement and then , just as quickly , replaced with dread . What will Dan say to all of this ?

177664	177700	177701	177701	You	1979	’ he exclaims . I look at Kate , who has the same expression on her face that I suspect I have on mine ; humour . Victoria ’s eyes bulge at Tom ’s huffiness . ‘

Just when I think I ’ve evaded him , his beady eyes land on me like a kettle - bell and I sag on my stool as he approaches . I glance around the bar , mindful that the doorman could be watching out for me , and then return my eyes to Matt , catching a glimpse of a healing black eye . I mentally applaud Jesse and suddenly wish I had relented and stayed at home with him . ‘
178478	178549	178550	178550	Matt	2587	’ he greets cheerfully , as if nothing has happened , as if he has n’t been feeding my parents duff information and spouting off that Jesse ’s an alcoholic , which promptly reminds me that he knows about Jesse ’s issue . How ? But he ’s not an alcoholic . I ignore the small part of my brain currently advising me that I might be in slight denial . ‘
178562	178571	178550	178550	Matt	2587	’ I maintain a steady , firm voice . ‘

178802	178901	178904	178904	darling	155	’m not being spied on . What am I going to say ? He just told me that he accepted it all . How many times do I have to tell him that there is no chance ? I could kiss Tom when he returns from the toilets and gives Matt his roving eye . Matt abruptly pushes himself away from the table as soon as Tom appears opposite him , knocking my bag flying to the floor . His tolerance level of my forward , gay friend has not improved . I jump down from my stool . ‘
178906	178918	178919	178919	He	155	’ Tom crouches down to help me gather my scattered possessions . ‘
178924	178933	178934	178934	He	155	’ he whispers to me on the floor . ‘
178938	178980	178934	178934	He	155	’ I screw my face up . I find Matt anything but hot now . He makes my skin crawl . I rise to find Matt walking away , holding his hand up in a catch - you - later gesture . ‘

I feel surprisingly steady . I pad across the bedroom and out onto the landing to see Jesse below , sat back in one of the huge armchairs talking quietly on his mobile . He ’s showered and shaved and is wearing some pale blue jeans . He ’s naked from the waist up . I lower myself quietly onto the top step and watch him through the curving glass that leads down to the big open space . He looks fresh but troubled . ‘

I follow his slow climb up until he ’s standing a few steps below me , looking down at me . What is he thinking ? His expression is flicking from anger to sorrow , back and forth , and his frown line looks like it ’s been set in place for a long , long while . ‘
186685	186730	186731	186731	I	363	’ I say through the dryness of my throat . I do n’t need Mr Neurotic on my case . I just want to forget about it and think myself lucky that it was n’t worse . It could have been so much worse . ‘

188029	188085	188086	188086	I	363	’ My eyes widen at his confession . His face is deadly serious and that ’s troubling . He is , in effect , saying he would kill himself , is n’t he ? Well , that is just crazy talk , but I do n’t think I would do well to point that out . ‘

188708	188758	188703	188703	he	2102	’m super suspicious now . He ca n’t have seriously been trying to get me pregnant ? But if he has been hiding them , then he knows damn well I ’ve not been taking them for a week . Or did he think I ’d replaced them already ? ‘

188963	189000	189001	189001	He	62	‘ Well , I did n’t tell him what had happened . I do n’t want your family thinking that I ca n’t look after you . He said you were supposed to be seeing him . ’

189088	189122	189063	189063	Jesse	431	’ He sounds angry again . I drag my head away from its resting place and look at him with all the misery I feel . His frown line has joined the argument . ‘
189143	189174	189175	189175	I	363	’ This is awful – my worst nightmare . Dan had undoubtedly called my parents . He pulls me down onto his chest and I notice his heart bucking wildly . ‘
189176	189195	189175	189175	I	363	’m going for a run . You take a shower . I ’ll get something to eat while I ’m

Chapter 29 A couple of hours later , I walk into the kitchen and find Jesse still in his running gear with his finger in a jar of peanut butter . I screw my face up in disgust as he glances up and gives me a small smile that does n’t quite reach his eyes . He looks on edge . ‘
189343	189357	189358	189358	I	363	’ He holds up a Starbucks cup , and I take it gratefully . ‘
189363	189367	189358	189358	I	363	’ he shrugs . ‘
189374	189375	189358	189358	I	363	’ ‘
189379	189390	189391	189391	I	363	’ I smile and take a seat next to him . ‘
189405	189437	189438	189438	I	363	’ He nods at my body as he plunges his finger into his mouth . I look down at my ripped jeans and cropped Jimmy Hendrix t - shirt and smile . ‘
189441	189460	189461	189461	I	363	’ I pull my t - shirt up to display my cream lace and he nods his approval . ‘
189468	189492	189461	189461	I	363	’ I pull over the nearest paper bag , finding a croissant . I make quick work , sinking my teeth into it . ‘
189508	189539	189461	189461	I	363	’ He thrusts his finger under my nose and I retreat back in my stool , violently shaking my head . He smiles a little and feeds it to himself , ‘
189549	189550	189551	189551	I	363	’ ‘
189556	189577	189578	189578	I	363	’ I garble around a mouthful of pastry . He looks at me and cocks his head to the side . ‘
189595	189612	189613	189613	I	363	’ He reaches up and knocks a flake of pastry from the corner of my mouth . ‘

189680	189692	189693	189693	I	363	‘ No , nothing , it went down the wrong way . ’
189725	189734	189735	189735	He	363	‘ Clive , yes , see him up . ’
189743	189746	189747	189747	he	363	‘ Jay . ’
189754	189761	189747	189747	he	363	‘ Jay ? Who ’s Jay ? ’
189772	189786	189787	189787	He	363	‘ The doorman . He ’s got the CCTV footage from the bar . ’
189821	189875	189820	189820	I	363	’m going to be sick . I hear the muffled greetings and a few moments later , Jesse walks back into the kitchen with Jay . The doorman gives me a small smirk , one that suggests he may have already watched the footage himself and knows what ’s coming . Yeah , I ’m
189895	189901	189902	189902	Jesse	431	‘ Where are you going ? ’
189919	189922	189923	189923	I	363	‘ Toilet . ’
189938	189957	189937	189937	I	363	’m out of sight , I race up the stairs and shut myself in the bathroom , where I ’m
190025	190028	190029	190029	I	363	‘ Ava ? ’
190036	190039	190029	190029	I	363	‘ Yes ? ’
190049	190053	190048	190048	I	363	’m so nervous . ‘

190083	190096	190097	190097	I	363	‘ Yes , fine . I ’ll be down in a minute . ’
190102	190119	190101	190101	I	363	’m ill would be stupid . He ’d break the door down to tend to me . ‘
190126	190127	190128	190128	I	363	’ ‘
190138	190143	190144	190144	I	363	’m having a wee . ’
190182	190190	190172	190172	I	363	‘ Okay , do n’t be long . ’
190191	190196	190197	190197	I	363	‘ I wo n’t . ’
190211	190309	190210	190210	I	363	’m panicking . Really panicking and I do n’t know why . I did n’t arrange to meet Matt . It was a chance encounter , that ’s all . FUCK ! Damn him for being so fucking persistent . Why ca n’t he just let it go instead of having the doorman lift the CCTV footage ? I should go down and stamp on the thing . I yank the door open and stomp out of the bathroom , through the bedroom and out on to the landing . He ’s taking this too far . I ’m
190407	190411	190412	190412	Jesse	431	‘ Slow it . ’
190424	190433	190416	190416	Jay	1102	‘ That ’s it , leave it playing . ’
190573	190577	190578	190578	Jesse	431	‘ Pause it . ’
190604	190609	190610	190610	Jay	1102	‘ Keep it going . ’
190628	190684	190685	190685	I	363	’m sat glued to the top step , running through the last time Jesse found out I ’d seen Matt . I really do n’t want a repeat of that . Why did n’t I foresee this ? I watch myself jump down from the stool and crouch to gather my scattered possessions with Tom . ‘
190690	190694	190685	190685	I	363	’ Jesse says . ‘
190700	190705	190685	190685	I	363	’ Jay answers swiftly . ‘
190718	190719	190720	190720	Ward	0	’ ‘
190731	190754	190730	190730	I	363	’m called away to deal with some drunken twat or a few cat fighting girls , then I ca n’t watch her . ’
190775	190784	190785	190785	I	363	‘ I do n’t need someone watching me . ’
190789	190847	190788	190788	I	363	’m feeling mad . Both of their heads swing around to me , Jay suddenly looking uneasy and Jesse looking stiff and agitated . There ’s a few moments silence lingering between us . It ’s uncomfortable , and I unconsciously wrap myself in my own arms as I sit , while Jesse scrutinises my every move . ‘
190858	190867	190849	190849	you	2122	’ Jay asks . The question shocks me . ‘
190870	190871	190849	190849	you	2122	’ ‘
190879	190891	190892	190892	I	363	’ Jesse pipes up , his arms folding across his chest . ‘
190910	190911	190902	190902	I	363	’ ‘
190921	190962	190965	190965	He	2125	’ Oh Fuck ! Should I lie ? I ’ve seen Jesse ’s reaction to a man coming on to me and it was n’t pleasant . Shit shit shit ! I glance nervously at Jesse . He knows what I ’m
190988	190995	190996	190996	he	2125	‘ Answer the question , Ava . ’
191008	191027	190996	190996	he	2125	‘ There was a guy at the bar who offered to buy me a drink . I refused . ’
191039	191092	191038	191038	I	363	’m uncomfortable , but he ’s going to find out for himself when he finishes watching the footage , so I may as well be upfront . Jesse is displaying some sort of stun - gun reaction and my heart starts thundering in my chest . I look down at my feet . ‘
191106	191118	191097	191097	I	363	’ I try and brush it off before Jesse passes out . ‘
191124	191285	191097	191097	I	363	’ he yells . I jump and reluctantly take a glimpse of him , finding bulging neck veins and a tense jaw . And then something catches my attention on the television and I look past Jesse . I should n’t have . I should have ignored it , and then maybe it would have passed before Jesse had a chance to see it . My blood turns to ice . At the bar is a tall , suited man . It ’s too late to feign ignorance . Jesse swings back towards the flat screen to see what has caught my abrupt attention , as does Jay . The silence is back as we all watch the man on the screen shift out of view when I get up to go to the bar . Then there ’s the pumped up , ponytailed creep , getting way too close , me dropping my change and gathering it up before I ’m
191355	191486	191354	191354	I	363	’m watching the footage with complete fascination now , also aware of Jesse ’s hard breathing , but too rapt by the television to look and confirm what I already know . He ’ll be rampant . Time is suddenly passing fast , but then Sam walks in and the motions slow down again as I get up from the table , leaving Sam drooling all over Kate . And then Jesse appears in the lower corner of the screen and I watch as I collapse , hitting the floor hard , the flurry of people gathering around my lifeless body blocking out my view . No one says anything – for a long , uncomfortable time . I turn my eyes to Jesse and find him watching me . I ’m
191539	191545	191546	191546	he	431	‘ Have you seen enough ? ’
191549	191552	191553	191553	Jesse	431	‘ Yes . ’
191581	191588	191589	191589	Jay	1102	‘ I ’ll be off then . ’
191600	191607	191608	191608	Jesse	431	‘ I ’ll see myself out . ’
191639	191690	191638	191638	I	363	’m in a slight trance . This really could have been so much worse . No doubt Jesse will have something to say about my lack of honesty with regards to Matt ’s presence , but he ca n’t blame me . Why would I openly offer that information ? I ’m
191724	191732	191733	191733	Jesse	431	‘ You did n’t mention Matt before . ’
191817	191826	191815	191815	Matt	2587	‘ I did n’t want to upset you . ’
191827	191831	191832	191832	His	2587	‘ Upset me ? ’
191839	191851	191832	191832	His	2587	‘ Okay , I did n’t want to piss you off . ’
191865	191874	191864	191864	I	363	’m surprised ; I was expecting boiling mad . ‘
191881	191882	191864	191864	I	363	’ ‘
191897	191898	191899	191899	He	431	’ ‘
191902	191903	191899	191899	He	431	’ ‘
191911	191941	191942	191942	I	363	’ His eyebrows are raised . He ’s right , an apology does n’t even take two seconds , but I ca n’t remember every detail of the conversation . ‘
191951	191957	191958	191958	Jesse	431	’ I gape at him . ‘
191977	191992	191967	191967	I	363	’ What did he want me to do ? Walk out of the bar ? ‘
192003	192004	191967	191967	I	363	’ ‘
192009	192022	192006	192006	you	2133	’ He ’s reining in his temper . I can see it . ‘
192029	192087	192025	192025	I	363	’ His teeth start working his bottom lip as he watches me . I feel guilty and I do n’t know why . I ’ve done nothing wrong . He ’s not shouting at me , but he ’s clearly not happy . What am I supposed to do ? I know he ’s thinking exactly what I ’m
192123	192128	192129	192129	He	388	‘ Then leave it . ’
192143	192145	192129	192129	He	388	‘ I ’m
192151	192267	192129	192129	He	388	’ He walks straight past me , leaving me stunned by his calm façade . I think I would rather have him blow his top . At least then I would know where I am . What now ? I haul myself up from the step and make my way towards the bedroom . I ca n’t stand this middle ground . I need to establish exactly what is going on in that complex mind of his . I know he ’s mad , so why is he holding back on his temper . It ’s not pleasant , but I would rather him rage a bit and clear the air . I feel like I ’m
192304	192331	192303	192303	I	363	’m drawn to the mass of beauty that stands before me , quaking with anger . It ’s potent , but he ’s not letting rip . ‘
192345	192462	192463	192463	Jesse	431	’ I sit myself on the vanity unit and put my hands in my lap . I notice for the first time since I woke up that my engagement ring is missing . Did he take it off ? The thought is like a stake through my heart . I do n’t like this , not one little bit . He does n’t say a word . He carries on soaping himself down before stepping out and grabbing a towel to dry himself off . He leaves me sat exactly where I am , my eyes darting around the bathroom , uncertainty plaguing me . I lower myself down and walk nervously back into the bedroom . ‘
192465	192589	192463	192463	Jesse	431	’ He completely ignores me and goes into the wardrobe , appearing a few moments later in some faded jeans . His jaw is ticking constantly and I can see it ’s taking his every effort to hold onto his emotions . I never thought I would want him to fly off the handle . And where is he going , anyway ? He pulls a grey t - shirt over his head and makes his way back into the bathroom while I stand in the middle of the room , wondering what the hell to do . I follow him again and find him brushing his teeth . His eyes flick to mine in the mirror . I feel anxious … uncomfortable . ‘
192595	192664	192463	192463	Jesse	431	’ I plead . I ca n’t stand this . He finishes brushing his teeth and splashes his face with water , before bracing himself on the edge of the vanity unit and taking a few deep breaths . I prepare myself for the storm , but it does n’t come . He walks straight past me and into the bedroom . I follow like a desperate soul . ‘
192670	192703	192704	192704	I	363	’ I ask his back , as he makes his way to the door . He stops and it ’s a few moments before he turns dark , troubled eyes on me . ‘
192715	192726	192731	192731	I	363	’ His voice is devoid of any emotion where as I ’m
192732	192735	192731	192731	I	363	’m petrified . ‘
192745	192751	192731	192731	I	363	’ I remind him desperately . ‘
192756	192780	192781	192781	You	2139	’ he mutters and turns to leave . That something is , without a doubt , me . He ’s going to drink . ‘
192782	192787	192788	192788	I	363	’re mad with me . ’
192905	192994	192904	192904	I	363	’m at a loss without him . I drag myself up and across the room , collapsing onto the bed and finding my way to the place that smells the most of him . It ’s a meager substitute for the real thing . Only he can make this better , make all of this go away . And worst of all , I know where he has gone , who will be there and what he ’ll be doing . What am I supposed to do ? I ’m
193104	193260	193103	193103	I	363	’m alone . I jump up and run into the bathroom , flinging open the cosmetics unit and staring at the masses of bottles , boxes and tubes . Starting my search , I shift the contents of the unit to the side , my shaking hands doing me no favours in executing the operation without knocking bottles over . A frustrated yell slips from my mouth , and in a temper , I sweep my hand through all of the shelves , knocking bottles flying all over the bathroom floor . What am I thinking ? He ’s not stupid enough to hide them in such an obvious place . I leave the bathroom and run into the wardrobe , shoving my hands into every pocket of his suit jackets , inside and out , tipping his shoes upside down and searching through piles of neatly folded t - shirts . Nothing , but I ’m
193520	193532	193519	193519	I	363	’m stood in the massive open space , looking around desperately . ‘
193535	193844	193519	193519	I	363	’ I curse to myself , but then the text message tone starts bleeping and I follow it to the armchair where I found Jesse sitting earlier . I grope down the side and find my phone . The missed call is from my Mum . Oh God , has Dan been on to her already ? I really can not be talking to her now , a really uncharitable thought , but I do n’t even know where I am myself to be able to tell her . My heart sinks when I see the text is from John . He ’s fine , but you should probably come . My heart lifts a little at the first part of the message , and then sinks just as quickly . I should probably go ? Is John playing tug of war with Jesse and a bottle of vodka ? I fly up the stairs and run into the bathroom to scrub my face and attempt to generally sort myself out . It ’s no good , I look like I ’ve been wailing and no amount of make - up or washing will sort my glazed eyes out . After retrieving my keys , I make a hasty run for my car , ignoring Clive as he calls after me . Chapter 30 The drive to The Manor is a blur of visions and memories . Visions of Jesse staggering and slurring , and memories of finding him unconscious on the terrace , all unwelcome , but a repeat performance highly likely . I ca n’t go through that again . I ca n’t watch him do that to himself again – not because of me . I might not be able to control his unreasonableness , but I can prevent him from slowly killing himself . I ’m

I do n’t need to look . I can feel it heavy in the air . As I approach the door to Jesse ’s office , I hear a thundering crack that makes me jump . What the fuck was that ? I hold the door handle and look behind me , but find the corridor empty . I turn the handle of the door and push it open . ‘
194063	194085	194088	194089	mother fucker	315	’ Big John ’s loud rumble travels down the corridor , halting my progression , but I ca n’t see him . ‘

194139	194225	194131	194131	woman	155	’ I look at the frantic beast rocketing towards me in slow motion and jump at the sound of another ear piercing snap . It pulls my attention from John ’s booming voice and towards Jesse ’s office . What is that ? I push the door open a little further until the full room comes into view . Oh Jesus Christ ! I stagger forward on a loss of a few dozen beats of my heart . What the fucking hell is going on ? ‘
194228	194240	194241	194241	Ava	0	’ John crashes into me and grasps me around my waist . ‘
194252	194349	194350	194350	Ava	0	’ I lose all feeling as I stare at the hideousness before me and then fight with the incredible strength of John , who ’s trying to haul me out of the room . I do n’t know how , adrenaline perhaps , but I break free from John and fall into the room as Sarah raises the evil looking whip that she ’s holding and brings it thrashing down on Jesse ’s back . My stomach jumps into my throat , and I feel John ’s warm palm wrap around the top of my arm . ‘

It ’s hard , even though time has slowed and every tiny detail is perfectly clear to me . He ’s naked , except for his jeans , and kneeling on the floor , his head dropped limply . He has n’t even looked up . Sarah is standing behind him , kitted out in black leather trousers , a leather bodice and a thigh high leather boots , looking as evil as the whip in her hand . I ca n’t move . I ’m
194639	194653	194638	194638	I	363	’m struggling against John again , who has regained his hold on me . ‘

A desperate cry escapes my mouth as our eyes meet and all I find are empty glazed holes . He does n’t look completely with it . He looks drugged and hollow . He makes to stand but staggers forward slightly in complete disorientation . My eyes fall onto his back , finding at least ten angry welts spread from one side of his back to the other , overlapping and seeping with beads of blood . I feel sick . My stomach starts to heave and as Sarah raises the whip again , I hear John in the distance bellowing her name . My knees give out and I crumble to the floor at John ’s feet . ‘
194821	194860	194861	194861	Jesus	155	’ Jesse makes it to a standing position , but he is nowhere near stable . He shakes his head as if trying to regain his focus , his confused face becoming stricken as he registers my presence . ‘

195179	195216	195178	195178	I	363	’m in the lowest level of hell and once again , trapped in a fucking cubicle with nowhere to go . The sound of the toilet door crashing into the tiled wall rings out around the ladies ’

I reach the entrance hall and take the stairs two at a time , walking quickly around the gallery landing and ignoring the women ’s harsh stares . But then I spot her . I know I should keep going . I know I should resist the temptation to throttle her , but the overwhelming urge gets the better of me . I approach her . She ’s chatting to a few female members , no doubt filling them in on the events of the past hour . She ’s still kitted out in her leather gear , whip still in hand . I stop behind her , the other women silencing immediately . Obviously curious to the sudden halt in conversation , she turns to face me . Her expression is superior , with a little sick satisfaction mixed in there too . My blood boils as she stands in front of me , relaxed in her pose , twirling the whip in her grasp . ‘

I do n’t stop there . I grab her hair in the most unladylike , cattish fashion and haul her up , pinning her against the wall by her throat . Shocked gasps ring out through the air before silence falls and the only sound is Sarah ’s stunned breathing . ‘

I ’ve made my point pretty clear to Sarah and every other person stood observing my meltdown . I leave them all and carry on my way to my original destination , shaking violently , breathing heavily . As I reach the bottom of the stairs to the communal room , I waiver for a few seconds , but as soon as I remember Jesse ’s words , I race up the stairs with nothing but adrenalin and determination coursing through my veins . I enter the dimly lit communal room , ignoring the few scenes playing out in front of me , while trying to blank out the erotic music that ’s invading my hearing . I ’m

202577	202684	202576	202576	I	363	’m not planning on kissing the man . I walk over to the stand by the wall and pick out the fiercest looking whip I can find before turning and handing it to him with steady hands . Any reluctance will foil me and this is the only way that I can demonstrate to Jesse how crazy all of this shit is . His face spreads into a wide smile as he accepts the whip and runs his eyes down my semi nakedness . I remove my jeans and walk over to stand myself under the suspended gold frame and hold my hands above my head . ‘

My heart starts a heavy , steady thump in my chest and I close my eyes , reciting Jesse ’s words in my mind . It ’s not possible . It ’s not possible . It ’s not possible . It ’s not possible . I blank my mind of everything except that , the music fades and I brace myself for my own punishment – my punishment for reducing Jesse to a fraught mess of a man , for making him need alcohol , not just want it , for turning him into an uptight , neurotic freak … for making him do this to himself . I hear it before I feel it . A fast , sharp whip though the air before it connects with my back . I cry out . Holy fucking shit ! The thrash sends a continuous stabbing pain radiating throughout my entire body and my legs turn to jelly . People volunteer themselves for this ? I ’ve volunteered for this ? I keep my eyes firmly shut . It ’s only now I realise that we did n’t agree on a number of strikes . I hold my breath and grit my teeth as a second lash falls across my back , and I mentally plead with myself to keep quiet and accept the beating . I tense myself , waiting for the next hit and when it comes , I release my body , hanging helplessly from the frame . I ’m

203198	203224	203197	203197	I	363	’m not even tensing anymore . Another thrash connects with my back and I jerk again , my back arching , my head flying back . ‘

203786	203793	203761	203761	he	431	‘ You crazy , stupid girl . ’
203808	203832	203807	203807	I	363	’m in so much pain , but I have no desire to move or voice my discomfort . I feel sedated , like I ’m
203881	203914	203880	203880	I	363	’m in absolute agony – I could n’t bear to see Jesse on his knees , accepting lashes dished out by Sarah or by anyone , for that matter . Not that I ’m
204002	204005	204006	204006	Jesse	431	‘ What ? ’
204116	204121	204122	204122	He	431	‘ Oh , Jesus . ’
204126	204142	204122	204122	He	431	‘ Baby , I need to move you , I need to see your back . ’
204181	204246	204180	204180	I	363	’m not ignorant to the fact that his own back is a blooded mess and he ’s leaning back on the sofa with me on his lap pressing into him . He must be in some serious pain himself . What a pair of crazy arse , challenging freaks we are . He sighs and rests his chin on the top of my head . ‘
204249	204257	204258	204258	I	363	’ he croaks , kissing my head . ‘
204263	204282	204283	204283	Ava	0	’ If I could talk , I would be throwing that right back at him . Why exactly ? ‘
204292	204317	204283	204283	Ava	0	’ He makes to move again and pain slices through me . I clench my dry eyes shut and let him move me until I ’m
204333	204361	204332	204332	I	363	’m suddenly heaving , my stomach convulsing , my body jerking , which only serves to increase the pain further . I double over on his lap . ‘
204365	204430	204332	204332	I	363	’ He places his hand on my back in an instinctive move to soothe me while my stomach decides if there ’s anything left inside me to bring up . The hot contact of his hand has me jolting forward on a cry and my stomach deciding that yes , there is something left to evacuate . I throw up all over the floor . ‘
204436	204443	204444	204444	He	363	’m sorry . Oh , fuck ! ’
204461	204477	204478	204478	His	363	‘ Fuck ! Fuck , fuck , fuck . Ava , what have you done ? ’
204503	204521	204522	204522	I	363	’m desperately trying to get a handle of my retching in an attempt to minimise the pain . ‘
204523	204532	204533	204533	He	363	’m going to move you now , okay ? ’
204546	204556	204557	204557	He	363	‘ I ca n’t lift you without touching you . ’
204651	204657	204658	204658	He	197	‘ Get on your front . ’
204680	204692	204658	204658	He	197	‘ Ava , I ca n’t believe you ’ve done this , ’
204743	204759	204760	204760	He	197	‘ This is going to sting , baby . I ’ll be gentle , okay ? ’

204803	204909	204910	204910	I	363	’ he says softly . He lowers his lips to mine and kisses me gently and it ’s the first time ever that I do n’t have to fight to respond , and it ’s not because I do n’t want to . He shakes his head , returning his attention to my back , and I pull in a severe , distressed breath as he unclasps my bra gently , letting the straps lie to the sides . Then I feel the soft cotton wool skimming over my skin . It feels like he is dragging barbed wire across my back . I sob . ‘
204911	204914	204915	204915	he	363	’m sorry . ’
204918	204920	204915	204915	he	363	‘ I ’m
204924	205047	204915	204915	he	363	’ I turn my face into my arms and clench my teeth as he attempts to coat me in the solution , refreshing the cotton wool repeatedly and reloading it with the warm mixture for each painful swipe . He curses with each one of my flinches . When I hear the bowl scrap across the table , I let out a long , thankful lungful of air . I turn my face back outwards and see the purple tinged water is now stained red and has all the used cotton wool balls piled inside , soaking up the liquid . He gets up from beside me and returns swiftly with a bottle of water . He crouches in front of me . ‘
205053	205102	204915	204915	he	363	’ I nod and start the painful process of getting myself up into a sitting position on the couch with Jesse flapping and cursing in front of me . My bra falls onto my lap and I half - heartedly attempt to pull it back over my boobs . ‘
205106	205120	205122	205122	your	363	’ He pushes my hands away and puts the water into my grasp . ‘
205125	205151	205122	205122	your	363	’ he orders softly . I comply without thought , letting my mouth fall open , accepting the two pills he puts on my tongue . ‘
205154	205270	205271	205271	I	363	’ The bottle feels like an iron weight as I lift it to my mouth . He places his hand on the base to alleviate some of the weight , and I welcome the ice cold water into my mouth . Jesse walks over to his desk and grabs his keys , phone and t - shirt . Stuffing them in various pockets , he then pulls his t - shirt over his head and down his body as he walks back towards me . Does n’t his back hurt ? Am I being a complete baby ? He gets my clothes from the back of the sofa and crouches back in front of me . ‘
205272	205277	205278	205278	He	363	’m taking you home . ’
205365	205370	205371	205371	He	363	‘ Can we try ? ’
205440	205451	205452	205452	He	363	‘ Ava , I do n’t know what to do . ’
205463	205476	205452	205452	He	363	‘ I ca n’t let you walk out there with nothing on . ’
205485	205492	205493	205493	He	363	‘ Please , do n’t cry . ’
205504	205510	205511	205511	He	363	‘ Oh , fuck it ! ’
205528	205532	205511	205511	He	363	‘ Come here . ’
205550	205566	205567	205567	I	363	‘ Wrap your legs around my waist , arms around my neck . Be careful . ’
205571	205577	205567	205567	I	363	’m told slowly and carefully . ‘
205582	205676	205679	205679	baby	0	’ he asks . I nod into his shoulder and link my ankles around the small of his back . I feel him pull my hair over my shoulder and rest his palm on the nape of my neck , holding me as tight as he can without inflicting further pain . My boobs are squished to his chest , my back completely exposed , but I could n’t care less . He strides to the door and releases my neck to open it , before replacing his hand securely at my nape . ‘
205681	205701	205679	205679	baby	0	’ he asks , walking down the corridor into the summer room . I nod into his neck . I ’m

205970	206002	205951	205951	I	363	’ he appeases her , and I do n’t hear her again , but I do hear Sam soothing her , his usual chirpy voice layered with concern . I know we ’re
206027	206037	206038	206038	Jesse	431	‘ Jesse , mate , I did n’t know . ’
206083	206124	206078	206078	he	431	‘ Steve , you want to be thanking all that ’s fucking holy I ’ve got my girl in my arms , because if I did n’t , the cleaners would be scooping up your remains for a fucking year . ’

206359	206385	206386	206386	I	363	‘ Jesse , stop being such a pigheaded twat and accept the fucking help ! You are not the only one who cares about her . ’
206387	206392	206393	206393	My	363	’m squeezed against him . ‘
206401	206444	206447	206447	Ava	0	’ Kate ’s hand brushes over my jeans as she negotiates the keys out of Jesse ’s pocket , and I smile on the inside at my fiery friend living up to her reputation . My eyes open and catch Kate ’s . ‘

206597	206676	206596	206596	I	363	’m facing the driver ’s side . Fucking hell , it hurts . He then lays a light sheet over me before shutting the door softly without even attempting to get the seatbelt over me . My head falls against the seat and my eyes close of their own accord . In no time at all , the driver door shuts and Jesse ’s scent invades my nose . I open my eyes and adjust my vision until I ’m
206689	206786	206688	206688	I	363	’m a hopeless , pathetic waif of a woman who has caused all of this chaos , pain and aching because I was trying to prove a point – a point I pray to God I ’ve made successfully because if I ’ve put myself through all of this , put Jesse through this and he still does n’t get it , then it ’s finished . Over . We ca n’t do this to each other . The thought makes my heart rate slow . He reaches over and brushes my cheek with his knuckles . ‘

206808	206871	206807	206807	I	363	’m crying in desperation . He turns the engine over and drives slowly down the driveway , the rushed roar and madcap driving skills that I ’ve fast become accustomed to , sidelined for a sensible purr of the DBS ’s engine . He takes corners carefully , accelerates and brakes gently and flicks his eyes to me at regular intervals . I ’m
206933	207011	206932	206932	I	363	’m sane enough to admit that . I was a normal , sound - minded girl . I definitely do n’t qualify for that anymore . The silence of the journey home is filled only by the humming of the car and the background sound of Snow Patrol ’s Run . Jesse pulls up to Lusso and makes his way around to my side of the car , helping me out while trying to keep me covered . ‘
207022	207039	207040	207040	Ava	0	’ he mutters as he lifts me back onto his chest . I suddenly feel panicky . ‘
207060	207091	207092	207093	Mr Ward	340	’ He sandwiches the sheet between our chests and does his best to hold it out to the side , shielding me from one angle before walking into the foyer . ‘
207095	207134	207135	207135	I	363	’ Clive sounds perplexed . The poor man has seen me drunk and carried ; defiant and carried ; sick and carried ; tired and carried . It must be clear that I am none of the above . ‘
207142	207153	207140	207140	Clive	76	’ Jesse tries his best to sound unaffected , but I ’m
207238	207241	207242	207242	He	431	‘ Easy . ’
207628	207802	207627	207627	I	363	’m a huge contributing factor to his sorry state , but if it ’s as he says and he punished himself because he thinks he deserves it , that everything happening is because of his past , then I may as well lock myself up in a glass case for the rest of my life . I watch as his eyelids flicker and slowly open , blinking a few times before he focuses in on me . I can see from the ticking of his minds cogs that his pre - awake brain is being flooded with information and reminders that will bring him back up to speed with where we are and why . It takes a few silent moments , but he eventually sighs and inches himself closer to me until we are nose to nose , him on his side and me still on my front . I do n’t feel close enough . I pull my arms from under the pillow and shift myself on a few winces until I ’m
207838	207843	207819	207819	he	2278	‘ It is possible . ’
207854	207867	207844	207844	I	363	‘ To understand how you feel about me , it is possible . ’
207868	207880	207819	207819	he	2278	‘ You did this to yourself to prove you love me ? ’
207881	207901	207902	207902	His	2278	‘ No , you know I love you . I did it to show you what it feels like . ’
207907	207923	207902	207902	His	2278	‘ I do n’t understand . I know what it feels like to be whipped . ’
207924	207944	207945	207945	I	363	‘ I do n’t mean that . I mean the agony of seeing the man I love hurting himself . ’
207965	208000	207958	207958	him	2278	‘ Nothing will ever hurt me as much as seeing you doing that to yourself . That will kill me , nothing else . If you punish yourself again , then I will too . ’
208078	208083	208071	208071	His	2278	‘ You love me . ’
208084	208129	208130	208130	He	2278	‘ I need you . I need you strong and healthy . I need you to understand how much I love you . I need you to know that I ca n’t be without you either . I would die before losing you too . ’
208135	208183	208130	208130	He	2278	‘ I do n’t deserve you , Ava . Not after the life I ’ve lived . I ’ve never had anything I ’ve valued or wanted to protect . Now I have , and it ’s a bizarre mixture of total happiness and complete fucking fear . ’
208193	208227	208184	208184	His	2278	‘ I filled an empty existence with drink and women . I ’ve never cared . I ’ve hurt the most precious thing in my life and I ca n’t cope with that . ’

209072	209086	209067	209067	I	363	’ He pushes my hair from my face and gazes at me thoughtfully . ‘
209092	209111	209087	209087	I	363	’ I do n’t like the sound of that . He does n’t look like he does either . ‘

209142	209237	209138	209140	Van Der Haus	388	’ I knew I was n’t going to like what he said , but I ca n’t see any way around this . Mikael is probably the equivalent of Patrick ’s retirement fund , and I know he ’s going to probably pass out with shock when I tell him that I ca n’t work with Mikael anymore . I really ca n’t , and I ’ve not even told Jesse about the text message . But he has just confirmed that he thinks it was Mikael in that footage too . Oh God . ‘
209242	209270	209138	209140	Van Der Haus	388	’ I blurt , shifting a little in an attempt to get myself up . His hands swiftly press into my shoulders , pushing me back down . ‘

209288	209303	209304	209304	He	363	‘ Listen , that ’s not the only thing I ’ve been thinking about . ’
209320	209323	209324	209324	I	363	‘ What ? ’
209358	209367	209350	209350	He	363	‘ I ca n’t ever be without you . ’

209431	209438	209439	209439	I	363	’ He raises a sarcastic eyebrow . ‘
209449	209479	209439	209439	I	363	’ I laugh hard and wince immediately afterwards , but Jesse does n’t join me in my hysterics . His lips purse and his grip increases on my hip . ‘
209488	209512	209485	209486	Jesse Ward	431	’ His eyebrows jump higher . He obviously disagrees , but I slap my hand over his mouth to halt his counter attack . ‘

209534	209546	209517	209517	I	363	’ he mumbles into my hand . I roll my eyes . ‘

209766	209788	209752	209752	He	2296	‘ You want to keep me as far away from the women of The Manor , but what about the sex ? ’
209832	209896	209897	209897	You	2297	’m not happy about his amusement at my question . He goes out of his way to dress me suitably , according to him , makes me wear lace – that request is suddenly very obvious – and he does n’t want me to drink . Oh God ! The reason for that has just landed with an enormous smack in my brain . ‘
209907	209924	209906	209906	I	363	’m going to do what you used to do when you were drunk . You think I ’m

210108	210111	210107	210107	you	2300	’re drunk . ’
210112	210125	210126	210126	I	363	‘ But it is part of the reason , is n’t it ? ’
210135	210144	210134	210134	I	363	’m fair game . He already admitted that . ‘
210151	210155	210134	210134	I	363	’ he admits . ‘
210163	210196	210197	210197	I	363	’ This I really need to know . He wants to make me the opposite of all things Manor - ish , yet he fucks me stupid . The grin is back . ‘

210998	211026	210997	210997	I	363	’m talking about . He has double the amount of lash marks , more blood and generally more to show for the shitty day we had yesterday . ‘
211035	211056	211066	211066	He	431	’ What am I saying ? He flies back around and I just about manage to release his waist before I ’m

I can feel my muscles knotting across my shoulders . I sit patiently on the vanity unit while Jesse goes about getting towels and the shampoo and conditioner , setting them on the side of the bath before collecting up the mess I ’ve made . He does it all in complete silence , not looking at me once . He knows what I ’ve been looking for . ‘

211409	211466	211408	211408	I	363	’m met by two eyebrows kissing his hairline as he jerks his head in a move gesture . I make a point of demonstrating the inconvenience he ’s causing me by taking my time and huffing a lot as I shift forward in the bath to make room for him . I do n’t know why I ’m

211578	211613	211616	211616	Steve	197	’m completely swathed in him . Right then . Now for the tub talk . I rest my head back against his shoulder and relish his morning stubble grazing the side of my face . ‘

211892	211945	211946	211946	He	2313	‘ Yes , but Steve knew you were off limits , that you are mine . He crossed a clear line that I drew and not just with who he practiced his shit on , but also how he carried it out , although the former is my ultimate bone of contention . ’
211962	211992	211946	211946	He	2313	‘ He accepted a whip from someone he had n’t met before and never even clarified the limits . You could have been mentally unstable for all he knew . ’

213892	213917	213832	213832	Jesse	431	’ Jesse informs her confidently . I clank the coffee pot against the side of the mug and then swing me eyes onto Jesse . ‘
213920	213964	213832	213832	Jesse	431	’ I am not getting married at The Manor ! Is he winding me up ? Oh God , I ’ve come over all sweaty at the thought of my parents roaming around the building and grounds . Would they work it out ? ‘
213967	213988	213832	213832	Jesse	431	’ he counters coolly . It has n’t taken long for the challenging arse who drives me insane to return . ‘
213992	214016	214066	214066	he	431	’ Cathy chirps . My eyes fly from Jesse to her . Does she know what The Manor is ? I feel like I ’m
214022	214027	214028	214028	Jesse	431	‘ It will be . ’
214164	214170	214152	214152	I	363	‘ Who are you marrying ? ’
214185	214188	214189	214189	he	431	‘ Compensation . ’
214192	214199	214189	214189	he	431	‘ I ’ll trample , Ava . ’
214200	214203	214204	214204	Cathy	90	‘ Pardon ? ’
214210	214213	214214	214214	we	2333	‘ Nothing . ’
214394	214407	214393	214393	I	363	’m yanked back over to the kitchen island in a complete daze . ‘
214410	214427	214393	214393	I	363	’ he demands in that tone – the one that I know not to ignore . I ’m
214449	214453	214436	214436	I	363	‘ Your sister ? ’
214458	214462	214463	214463	he	363	‘ Leave it . ’
214522	214565	214521	214521	I	363	’m guessing it must be Jesse ’s . With the added clue of a sabotaged invite strewn without thought into the bin , it most certainly is Jesse ’s choice . I study his profile , but dare not say a word . ‘
214570	214591	214592	214592	I	363	’ Cathy presents me and Jesse with our breakfast and then stuffs a duster in the front of her apron . ‘
214601	214602	214606	214606	Cathy	90	’ ‘
214608	214652	214606	214606	Cathy	90	’ Jesse says with zero gratitude . I ca n’t even speak . I start picking at the edges of my salmon bagel in an awkward silence and after an eternity of quiet , I finally relent and lower myself from my stool . ‘
214658	214663	214655	214655	you	2342	’ he asks shortly . ‘
214666	214694	214695	214695	Ava	0	’ I make my way from the kitchen , leaving my breakfast untouched . Jesse and the constant challenges surrounding him are doing my appetite no favours . ‘
214704	214712	214713	214713	Ava	0	’ he threatens . I ignore him . ‘
214715	214720	214721	214721	You	0	’ I swing around . ‘
214731	214737	214738	214738	I	363	’m marrying you , Jesse . ’
214773	214802	214772	214772	I	363	’m allowed to leave the kitchen , taking myself up to the master - suite without so much as a countdown or a Jesse style sense fuck . I ’m
214868	214970	214867	214867	I	363	’m not hanging around the tower all day like a spare part and my back feels all right , if I do n’t make too many sudden movements . I will just be under Cathy ’s feet , and I would rather face Patrick and his certain questioning with regards to mine and Jesse ’s relationship . I flick through the rails and rails of new dresses and settle on one of my old ones . I get changed and slip my heels on before presenting myself to the mirror to put some make up on . The bedroom door opens . ‘
214976	215000	214867	214867	I	363	’ he asks , with a hint of apprehension in his voice . That would be the separation under his terms rule that I ’m
215003	215005	214867	214867	I	363	‘ I ’m
215010	215011	215013	215013	you	2347	’ ‘
215014	215017	215013	215013	you	2347	’re not . ’
215018	215024	215025	215025	I	363	‘ Yes , I am . ’
215058	215064	215065	215065	I	363	‘ How ’s your back ? ’
215072	215075	215076	215076	I	363	‘ Sore . ’
215146	215152	215131	215131	I	363	‘ Where ’s my phone ? ’
215161	215169	215170	215170	I	363	‘ It ’s charging in my office . ’
215171	215178	215170	215170	I	363	’m surprised he volunteered that information . ‘
215182	215208	215170	215170	I	363	’ I pick my bag up and walk to the door but jump back when Jesse lands in front of me , blocking my path . ‘
215213	215227	215170	215170	I	363	’ he spits the words out like they are garbage in his mouth . ‘
215238	215239	215234	215234	I	363	’ ‘
215245	215250	215234	215234	I	363	’ He shrugs sheepishly . ‘
215274	215278	215265	215265	I	363	’ he grumbles . ‘
215291	215292	215289	215289	Jesse	431	’ ‘
215303	215341	215289	215289	Jesse	431	’ He gives me that roguish grin , and I fight to keep the smile twitching the corners of my lips . I need to keep this serious . He takes my hand and moves into me . ‘
215367	215368	215369	215369	I	363	’ ‘
215370	215395	215369	215369	I	363	’m not marrying someone who refuses to open up . You keep holding information back and then we end up in a huge mess . ’
215396	215411	215369	215369	I	363	‘ I did n’t tell you things because I was scared you would run . ’
215412	215425	215369	215369	I	363	‘ Jesse , I ’ve found out some pretty shocking stuff and I ’m
215429	215430	215431	215431	I	363	’ ‘
215434	215438	215439	215439	Ava	0	’ he sighs . ‘
215479	215484	215485	215485	I	363	’re just fucking someone . ’
215500	215508	215509	215509	I	363	‘ Do n’t say things like that . ’
215519	215522	215523	215523	he	363	‘ Sit . ’
215536	215588	215530	215530	He	363	‘ The last time I saw my parents it did n’t go particularly well . My sister was a bit underhanded and set us up to meet . My father had a rant , my mother got upset and I got very drunk , so you can imagine how it ended . ’
215613	215624	215625	215625	My	363	‘ So your sister obviously wants you to make amends . ’
215632	215639	215640	215640	he	431	‘ Amalie is a bit stubborn , ’
215655	215675	215676	215676	He	431	‘ She wo n’t accept that too much has happened , too many harsh words exchanged over the years . ’
215689	215697	215676	215676	He	431	‘ It ’s not fixable , Ava . ’
215698	215701	215702	215703	your parents	430	‘ But they ’re
215705	215718	215719	215719	You	2355	’ I ca n’t imagine my life without my Mum and Dad . ‘
215720	215724	215725	215725	He	431	’re their son . ’
215759	215793	215756	215756	He	431	‘ That invitation only arrived because my sister sent it behind my parent ’s backs . They do n’t want me there . Their address was scrubbed off and replaced with Amalie ’s . ’
215794	215812	215865	215865	he	2357	‘ But Amalie obviously wants you there . Do n’t you want to see her get married ? ’
215813	215849	215756	215756	He	431	‘ I would love to see my little sister get married , but I also do n’t want her wedding ruined . If I go , it will end only one way . Trust me . ’
215850	215859	215860	215860	His	2357	‘ What happened to make it like this ? ’
215899	215929	215930	215930	He	2357	‘ You already know that Carmichael left me The Manor when he died . Of course , when I told you that , you thought it was a hotel . ’
215982	216020	216021	216021	He	2357	‘ Things were already strained after they moved to Spain and I chose to stay with Carmichael . I was eighteen , living at The Manor and I understand that it was any parent ’s worst nightmare . ’
216030	216075	216021	216021	He	2357	‘ I slipped into a playboy lifestyle and fell harder when Carmichael died . If it was n’t for John , there probably would n’t be a Manor . He practically ran it while I gorged on too much drink and too many women . ’
216076	216079	216080	216080	I	363	‘ Oh . ’
216090	216125	216126	216126	He	2357	‘ I calmed it down , but my parents offered me an ultimatum ; The Manor or them . I chose The Manor . Carmichael was my hero , I could n’t sell up . ’
216135	216144	216126	216126	He	2357	‘ Your parents knew you were carrying on … ’
216151	216158	216145	216145	I	363	‘ Well , like you were . ’
216171	216254	216255	216255	I	363	‘ Yes and they predicted it , so you see , they were right and they ’ve never let me forget it . I ’ve lived a pretty sordid lifestyle , I admit that . Carmichael was the family black sheep . No one spoke to him and the family disowned him . They were embarrassed of him and then he died and I filled the shoes of the black sheep . My parents are ashamed of me . That ’s it . ’
216262	216271	216255	216255	I	363	‘ They should n’t be ashamed of you . ’
216279	216288	216289	216289	He	2358	‘ It ’s just the way it is . ’
216292	216302	216289	216289	He	2358	‘ So you ’ve known John a long time ? ’
216315	216322	216314	216314	we	2360	’re talking sixteen - ish years . ‘
216329	216334	216335	216335	He	2358	’ he smiles fondly . ‘
216342	216343	216335	216335	He	2358	’ ‘
216349	216356	216347	216347	he	2358	’ He looks up and frowns . ‘
216364	216365	216361	216361	I	363	’ ‘
216373	216377	216371	216371	Carmichael	193	’ I ask . ‘
216385	216386	216382	216383	Thirty one	2362	’ ‘
216390	216416	216382	216383	Thirty one	2362	’ I blurt . I imagined him to be a long silver haired , tanned , smarmy type . He laughs at my stunned face . ‘
216437	216438	216427	216427	He	3884	’ ‘
216441	216449	216427	216427	He	3884	’ I do a quick mental calculation . ‘
216463	216464	216465	216465	He	3884	’ ‘
216472	216473	216465	216465	He	3884	’ ‘

216490	216494	216489	216489	I	363	’m intrigued . I ’m
216508	216523	216507	216507	I	363	’m like a dog with a bone . Sadness washes over Jesse ’s face . ‘
216529	216530	216507	216507	I	363	’ ‘
216533	216724	216507	216507	I	363	’ I whisper , but then realisation dawns . My eyes drift down his stomach and linger in the area where I know his scar to be . Jesse was in the car with Carmichael . Oh God . All of those times I ’ve probed him and badgered him about it , he said it was too painful to talk about and it really is . My one million piece Jesse jigsaw puzzle is all starting to fit together . His Mum and Dad moved to a different country , he refused to go because he wanted to stay with his uncle , who was more like a brother – I will disregard the fucking about part – and then three years later , he lost Carmichael in a tragic accident that caused major injuries to him too . It ’s no wonder he fell deeper into the pit of drink and sex afterwards . It all makes perfect sense now . I feel like a huge weight has just been lifted from my shoulders . Of course there is a reason for why he is like he is . ‘
216731	216748	216507	216507	I	363	’ He pulls me over onto his lap with care and nuzzles my nose with his . ‘
216776	216800	216769	216769	I	363	’ I melt all over him . My new found knowledge , coupled with his reasonableness , refuses to let me say no . ‘
216808	216846	216801	216801	I	363	’ I say assertively . I need to sort out some seriously troubling issues at work . Namely … Mikael Van Der Haus . I ca n’t even begin to imagine what Patrick is going to say . ‘
216849	216855	216858	216858	I	363	’ He rolls his eyes . ‘
216859	216892	216858	216858	I	363	’m going for a run to alleviate some of the pressure that my challenging temptress presents me with , and then we snuggle all afternoon and go out for dinner . Deal ? ’
216893	216913	216914	216914	He	363	‘ Deal , but I challenge the middle part of that statement and trump it with a deluded God . ’
216933	216939	216940	216940	he	363	‘ Kiss me , now . ’
216975	216981	216982	216982	I	363	‘ Good morning , baby . ’
216992	217000	216982	216982	I	363	‘ It ’s not , is it ? ’
217001	217022	217023	217023	He	363	‘ No , it ’s five o’clock . You ’ve been asleep all afternoon . How does your back feel ? ’
217068	217073	217063	217063	I	363	‘ It feels okay . ’
217095	217097	217086	217086	I	363	‘ I ’m
217112	217129	217086	217086	I	363	’ I turn into his chest and get my fix of pure fresh water and mint . ‘
217152	217153	217155	217155	you	2369	’ ‘
217157	217161	217155	217155	you	2369	’ I grumble . ‘
217176	217221	217166	217166	you	2369	’ I push my lips into his chest , contemplating that he might just get his way . I know Patrick well , but not well enough to be confident that he would send Mikael packing when I tell him what ’s going on . ‘
217224	217233	217166	217166	you	2369	’ He threads his fingers through my hair . ‘

217320	217348	217317	217317	you	2369	’ he asks , rather reasonably . That ’s not like him at all . And him turning down the opportunity to keep me in bed ? I ’m
217351	217356	217357	217357	he	363	‘ But then again , ’
217360	217377	217378	217378	He	363	‘ I ’ve not been inside you for way too long . That is not acceptable . ’
217387	217402	217378	217378	He	363	‘ Baby , sleepy sex is off the menu for a while , so I ’m
217412	217475	217476	217476	You	2369	’ He rests his body half on mine , his eyes instantly smoking out . That , mixed with his lurid words , has me whipped into a lustful frenzy . But he ’s even asking me if I mind him taking me , which , not surprisingly , I do n’t , but I prefer dominant Jesse taking what he wants . ‘
217477	217485	217486	217486	I	363	’re asking if you can fuck me ? ’
217487	217515	217486	217486	I	363	’m full of suspicion and you can tell . His eyes dance with mischief as he kisses the corner of my mouth and then the other corner . ‘
217521	217527	217528	217528	He	363	’m trying to be reasonable . ’

217585	217599	217584	217584	I	363	’m getting a little breathy . He knows exactly what he ’s doing . ‘
217608	217613	217614	217614	He	363	’m a little confused . ’
217629	217640	217641	217641	he	363	‘ You really do n’t want me to be reasonable ? ’
217646	217649	217641	217641	he	363	‘ No ! ’
217650	217654	217655	217655	He	363	‘ I see . ’

218032	218045	218031	218031	I	363	’m going to fall apart and I need his mouth on me , ‘
218053	218061	218051	218051	Ava	0	’ he asks under half hooded eyes . ‘
218069	218070	218071	218071	You	363	’ ‘

His tongue rolls around my mouth , firm but slow , harsh but worshipfully . He ’s making me remember . His firm chest pressed into my side , his wonderful mouth all over mine and his long , talented fingers working me , has my body solidifying , my mind going blank and my soul reinstated . I ’m

222893	222934	222935	222935	You	841	’m not pregnant . My life would be over . And how would he be with his children if he ’s like this with me ? Waiting for this period is going to be the longest time of my life . ‘
222938	222942	222935	222935	You	841	’ he asks . ‘
222945	222950	222935	222935	You	841	’ I answer quickly . ‘
222959	222982	222935	222935	You	841	’ I ask , diverting the conversation from what is a completely pointless one . He ’ll never admit it , anyway . ‘

223000	223027	222997	222997	She	90	’ he says quietly , and I know he feels the same way about Cathy . By his own admission he could n’t live without her . ‘

223042	223045	223039	223039	Baby	93	’m sorry ! ’

223205	223214	223215	223215	I	363	‘ You kept it a secret from me . ’
223228	223261	223215	223215	I	363	‘ That ’s because I was falling hard and fast in love with you and it scared me to death to think you would run away from me if you found out . ’
223275	223280	223281	223281	he	2406	‘ And you did . ’
223284	223293	223281	223281	he	2406	‘ It was a bit of a shock . ’
223339	223364	223365	223365	I	363	‘ I knew you were experienced , but I did n’t anticipate it was because you owned a sex club that you utilised excessively . ’
223372	223375	223376	223376	He	2406	‘ Hey ! ’
223394	223426	223376	223376	He	2406	‘ Let ’s not re - visit old news . It ’s all about us , and now and tomorrow and the next day and then the rest of our lives . ’
223427	223433	223434	223434	I	363	‘ Okay . Kiss me . ’

223513	223523	223524	223524	He	363	’m ignoring you . Wear your new cream dress . ’
223711	223723	223724	223724	He	363	‘ So , what can you tell me other than that ? ’
223762	223774	223775	223775	he	363	‘ It ’s fucking convenient that the other camera is broken . ’
223779	223790	223775	223775	he	363	‘ Have you checked the footage from outside the bar ? ’
223817	223827	223807	223807	he	363	‘ Fine , let me know what you find . ’
223843	223850	223851	223851	he	363	‘ It ’s a fucking joke . ’

223869	223875	223876	223876	I	363	‘ Yes , I do . ’
223900	223909	223910	223910	I	363	‘ Do you think that Mikael drugged me ? ’
223916	223924	223925	223925	He	363	‘ I do n’t know , Ava . ’
223930	223941	223925	223925	He	363	‘ It ’s a bit farfetched , is n’t it ? ’

223997	224003	224004	224004	I	363	’ He shakes his head . ‘
224005	224010	224004	224004	I	363	’m dealing with it . ’
224011	224014	224015	224015	I	363	‘ Okay , ’
224020	224031	224032	224032	I	363	’m not arguing with him on this . He sighs . ‘

224053	224068	224069	224069	I	363	’ I recoil , feeling panicked that he would even suggest such a thing . ‘

224109	224116	224117	224117	I	363	‘ I said , do n’t ! ’
224120	224139	224140	224140	I	363	‘ I do n’t need a reminder that there have been other women since I ’ve met you . ’
224141	224146	224147	224147	I	363	’m really mad now . ‘
224148	224162	224147	224147	I	363	’m sorry . I wish I could change everything , except you . You ’re

224301	224308	224311	224311	I	363	‘ I like my dress too . ’
224312	224356	224357	224357	I	363	’m panting again . My bag tumbles to the kitchen floor and I grab the front of his suit jacket . He slips his finger out and brings it up to my mouth , wiping the wetness straight across my freshly glossed lips . ‘
224358	224364	224365	224365	He	363	’m a very lucky man . ’
224425	224433	224412	224412	I	363	‘ That colour does n’t suit you . ’

224471	224479	224457	224457	He	363	‘ I want to dance with you . ’
224480	224484	224490	224490	I	363	‘ You do ? ’
224485	224489	224490	224490	I	363	‘ I do . ’
224516	224553	224554	224554	You	2415	’m yanked into his chest , his palm rests on my lower back and his spare hand grasps mine . I place my other hand on his shoulder and look up at him on a smile . ‘
224560	224573	224574	224574	I	363	’ His eyes twinkle , his luscious lips tipping at the corner . ‘
224575	224594	224595	224595	He	363	’m going to make you happy for the rest of my life , baby . Let ’s dance . ’
224608	224619	224595	224595	He	363	’re in the vast open space of the penthouse , I ’m
224651	224667	224650	224650	I	363	’m weaved between the furniture , twirled around while he smiles down at me . I ’m
224693	224699	224700	224700	I	363	‘ What are we doing ? ’
224709	224726	224700	224700	I	363	‘ I do n’t know . Something between a waltz and a quickstep , I think . ’
224749	224764	224739	224739	His	363	‘ I think I enjoy this just as much as being buried inside you . ’
224765	224768	224769	224769	I	363	‘ Really ? ’
224775	224778	224779	224779	He	363	‘ No . ’

224922	224930	224931	224931	I	363	‘ Who has the power , Ava ? ’
224936	224940	224931	224931	I	363	‘ You do . ’
224941	224943	224915	224915	His	363	‘ You ’re

224971	224979	224980	224980	You	0	’ He smiles , and I frown . ‘
224981	224990	224980	224980	You	0	’re the one with the power , baby . ’
224991	225004	225005	225005	He	363	‘ But you always insist it ’s you who holds the power . ’
225008	225016	225017	225017	I	363	‘ I like you stroking my ego . ’
225021	225026	225017	225017	I	363	‘ Are you joking ? ’
225027	225030	225031	225031	I	363	‘ No . ’
225074	225104	225064	225064	He	363	‘ I hold the power over your body , Ava . When those beautiful eyes are full of lust for me , that ’s when I hold the power . ’
225153	225156	225157	225157	he	363	‘ See . ’
225174	225181	225157	225157	he	363	‘ The power ’s yours again . ’
225195	225215	225182	225182	I	363	‘ That ’s why you fuck me senseless , give me the countdown and demand I kiss you when I ’m
225218	225222	225182	225182	I	363	’ He smiles . ‘
225227	225228	225229	225229	You	2421	’ ‘
225236	225246	225247	225247	He	363	’m never going to let you touch me again ! ’
225309	225326	225297	225297	His	363	‘ Well , Mr Ward . Given how much sex we have , I ’d say you ’re
225336	225365	225366	225366	Baby	93	’ I grin when he starts with the laughing again . It ’s a wonderful sight , the faint lines fanning his greens , making his eyes sparkle . ‘
225375	225376	225366	225366	Baby	93	’ ‘
225386	225387	225391	225391	Ava	0	’ ‘
225393	225407	225391	225391	Ava	0	’ He sweeps my hair away from my face and cups my cheeks . ‘
225418	225419	225391	225391	Ava	0	’ ‘
225423	225428	225429	225429	I	363	’ He leans in . ‘
225432	225472	225429	225429	I	363	’ His lips brush gently over mine and I indulge him , handing him the control he craves , letting his tongue saturate my senses as he hums into my mouth and draws all of the power from me . ‘
225475	225482	225429	225429	I	363	’ I ask around his lips . ‘
225495	225515	225488	225488	lady	59	’ He places me on my feet before turning the music off and scooping my clutch from the floor . ‘
225518	225519	225488	225488	lady	59	’ ‘
225529	225546	225488	225488	lady	59	’ I take my bag and retrieve my phone . I had almost forgotten about that . ‘
225550	225562	225488	225488	lady	59	’ he asks on a frown . He clearly has too . ‘
225571	225620	225488	225488	lady	59	’ I scroll through my phone , my heart beating nervously . This is it . This is the moment I get this off my chest . I have it plain and clear , so he ca n’t possibly argue with it . John would n’t do this . ‘
225623	225695	225696	225696	I	363	’ I hold my phone up to him and he takes it . His frown line creeps across his brow as he reads the message , a thoughtful look plaguing his expression . His eyes flick to mine and back to the screen . He ’s really thinking about this . After what seems like forever , with me tense and him staring at the screen , he starts nodding mildly . ‘
225703	225768	225696	225696	I	363	’ He tosses my phone on the counter . He does n’t look very happy at all . I sag a little in relief . I think I almost expected him to defend her or say that it must have been someone else , but who else would do that ? I do n’t need to say anything more . He knows , and I ’m
225818	225823	225817	225817	I	363	’m off work today . ‘
225828	225832	225833	225835	A new client	250	’ he asks . ‘
225845	225865	225840	225843	the arse new client	250	’ He takes my phone and slides it back on the worktop , then pulls me into his chest . ‘
225877	225884	225871	225871	you	2428	’ I nod into his chest . ‘
225887	225990	225991	225991	I	363	’ His lips press into the top of my head and he releases me , holding his arm out in a very gentlemanly manner . I smile , threading my arm through his . He winks and leads me out of the penthouse and to the elevator . We reflect in all of the mirrors around us . Everywhere I look , I can see him in all of his beauty , and me with my hand slipped under his suit jacket , un - willing to let him go . He glances down at me out the corner of his eye . ‘
226004	226014	225991	225991	I	363	’ he says in a low , quiet voice . ‘
226022	226023	226024	226024	You	2430	’ ‘
226027	226045	226024	226024	You	2430	’ He returns his eyes forward , and I find them in the reflection of the doors . ‘
226049	226098	226024	226024	You	2430	’ I quickly scan my mind for anything he might be referring to , and I come up with – in Jesse ’s world – way too much for him to hold against me . But this morning I ’ve been compliant and he has been quite reasonable . ‘
226114	226204	226205	226205	Clive	76	’ His face is completely straight and his words full of meaning . I smile and tuck myself into his side . I ’ve not really had to wait very long for him at all , two crappy relationships aside . While he was battling numerous demons , I was blissfully unaware and going through the motions of any normal young woman . It ’s a strange thought . The elevator door opens and his arm drapes gently around my shoulder as we walk through the foyer of Lusso . ‘
226207	226276	226205	226205	Clive	76	’ Jesse nods at Clive , who nods brusquely in return before he continues with something that has his attention on his desk . He did n’t even acknowledge me or ask how I am . I heard his concerned voice last night when Jesse carried me in . Have I upset him again ? We emerge into the cool , evening air and Jesse bleeps the DBS . ‘
226289	226293	226279	226279	Kate	431	’ he says . ‘
226300	226334	226335	226335	Jesse	431	’ I ask , but he just shrugs off my accusation . I sigh and open my bag to retrieve my phone , but after a little rummage , I discover no phone . ‘
226346	226359	226335	226335	Jesse	431	’ He makes a long , exaggerated point of demonstrating the inconvenience I ’m
226362	226365	226366	226366	He	2433	‘ Here . ’
226371	226382	226366	226366	He	2433	‘ Hurry up or we ’ll be late for dinner . ’
226383	226389	226390	226390	I	363	‘ I ’ll be quick . ’
226498	226505	226506	226506	I	363	‘ What … how … when … ’
226521	226524	226525	226525	Mum	249	‘ Hello . ’
226588	226596	226597	226597	I	363	‘ How did you get in here ? ’
226606	226622	226623	226623	Mum	249	‘ Oh , did n’t you know ? Your father is a retired cat burglar . ’
226641	226644	226645	226645	I	363	‘ Mum ? ’
226653	226669	226670	226670	She	249	‘ Ava O’Shea , get you backside over here and give your Mother a hug . ’
226683	226691	226678	226678	I	363	‘ I knew she would do that ! ’
226696	226700	226678	226678	I	363	‘ Bloody women ! ’
226701	226707	226708	226708	She	249	‘ Shut up , Joseph . ’
226735	226750	226729	226729	she	249	‘ Ah , Ava . What are you crying for ? Stop it , you ’re
226755	226756	226757	226757	I	363	’ ‘
226758	226765	226766	226766	I	363	’m so pleased to see you . ’
226809	226832	226833	226833	She	2444	‘ Ava , you could n’t avoid us forever , even if we are miles away . Let me look at you . ’
226851	226892	226850	226850	I	363	’m my mother ’s daughter . Her eyes mirror mine , all big and chocolaty and her hair that matches mine in colour is cut into a short sweeping style . She looks good for forty seven – really good . ‘

226995	227005	227006	227006	I	363	’re stood in Jesse ’s ten million pound penthouse . ‘

I want to swear my head off , but my Mum hates swearing just as much as Jesse . Well , Mum hates all swearing , full stop . Jesse just hates me swearing , but thinks it is perfectly acceptable for him to rant like a sailor . ‘

227911	228018	227910	227910	I	363	’m conscious that they do n’t know Jesse ’s business nature and what he did when he drank . Or about the punishment he subjected himself to because he thought he had failed me , because he thought he deserves retribution – or the fact that I could be pregnant . I could go on forever . That ’s a whole other weight on my shoulders . Did he explain to them about the drinking ? After Matt ’s call to them , they must be wondering . Mum gets down from her stool and makes her way around the island , her eyes all glazed . ‘

229377	229495	229500	229500	I	363	’ He proceeds to direct everyone out of the kitchen and onto the terrace , where I find everything has been set for a meal . The outside dining table has been superbly laid , the patio heaters have been lit to take the edge off the cool evening air and bottles of wine and beer are chilling in the drinks fridge by the huge built - in barbeque . I throw Jesse a questioning look . How did he manage all of this ? He smiles and gives me a gesture of sleep . While I was snoozing most of the day , he has been busy meeting my parents and preparing all of this ? I ’m
229501	229594	229500	229500	I	363	’m in a half trance as the people I love the most in the world converse , chat , laugh and drink at the table , while Luigi and his staff prepare and serve a luscious Italian feast . Jesse keeps his hand firmly on my knee , choosing to eat one handed , squeezing every so often , particularly harder when Dan commences his older brother speech . I watch Jesse struggle to remain polite and gracious while they chat , and when my mother catches the line of conversation , I ’m
229671	229679	229680	229680	Jesse	431	‘ Kate ’s not her normal self . ’
229692	229697	229680	229680	Jesse	431	‘ Is she okay ? ’

229747	229752	229753	229753	I	363	‘ It was lovely . ’

I hear my Mum ’s sharp intake of breath and mine that follows shortly after . I look down at him with a gaping mouth and wide eyes as he takes my hand and looks up at me with crystal clear green . ‘
229990	230001	229881	229881	us	2484	’ he asks quietly . I start to physically shake . ‘

My Mum has her hand over her mouth and my Dad has a small smile on his lips . Dan is expressionless and Kate and Sam are relaxed in their chairs with matching grins . My heart commences gallop in my chest as I return my body to face Jesse , my glazed eyes to his . He ’s only just met my parents . He ca n’t land this on me – not in front of them . ‘

230171	230200	230205	230205	Ava	0	’ He drops my hand and glides his palms around the backs of my legs to pull me closer , prompting my hands to rest on his shoulders . ‘
230207	230238	230205	230205	Ava	0	’ he whispers . My hands drift up to find the back of his head and my fingers thread through his dark blonde hair as he looks up at me . ‘
