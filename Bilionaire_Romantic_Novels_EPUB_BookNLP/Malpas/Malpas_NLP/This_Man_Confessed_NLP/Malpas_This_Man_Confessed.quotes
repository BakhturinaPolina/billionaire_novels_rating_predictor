35	92	34	34	I	2813	’m alone , my first few , silent , reflective moments of the day so far and probably the last . I ’ve been waiting for this tiny snippet of time , begging for it among the chaos surrounding me . I need this moment , just me to myself , absorbing the massive leap that I ’m
178	186	177	177	I	2813	’m marrying this man . And why I ’m
223	283	222	222	I	2813	’m getting married at The Manor . The biggest day of my life is taking place at the plush sex haven of my Lord . My nerves are n’t only a result of me being the bride . My parents , brother , and family members are all roaming around the grounds of Jesse ’s supposed country retreat . They ’re
415	627	414	414	I	2813	’m not so worried about the male members of my family , they ’ll all just prop themselves up at the bar and only move on demand . But my mum and aunt are a different story entirely . My mother , with her love of all things luxurious , is gushing over the place and has suddenly taken the role of tour guide , keen to demonstrate just how magnificent Jesse ’s county estate is . I wish she would n’t . I wish she ’d join my dad at the bar . I wish I could cement her backside to a stool and feed her Mario ’s Most Marvellous all day and night . Marrying at The Manor is an added stress that I really do n’t need on my wedding day , but when my challenging , neurotic birthday boy had me surrounded by his hard , warm strength and sprawled across the terrace , I agreed — no sense fuck required . I know he ’s taken care of everything . The Manor really does look just like an exclusive resort , but I know what ’s on the next floor , and all of those beds are currently dancing on the ceiling above me , like they ’re
741	775	740	740	I	2813	’m too bloody nervous . Pulling myself up from my reclined position , I walk over to the mirror and gaze at my reflection . Despite my unease , I look fresh . I ’m
1081	1084	1073	1073	My	2813	‘ Yes ? ’
1102	1111	1085	1085	I	2813	‘ Ava , darling , are you decent ? ’

She looks stunning , steering away from the traditional mother - of - the - bride matching dress , jacket and hat , and instead adorning her tidy figure with a lovely oyster coloured , satin shift dress . Her short , sweeping hairstyle is arranged with a feather and pearl hairpiece . ‘

1267	1293	1294	1294	She	57	’m sure he ’ll make an exception for family . Your grandparents would ’ve thought they were in Buckingham Palace , God rest their souls . ’

1333	1339	1320	1320	She	57	‘ It ’s nearly time . ’

1671	1682	1657	1657	She	246	‘ Darling , can your mother offer you some advice ? ’
1683	1686	1687	1687	I	2813	‘ No . ’
1709	1724	1725	1725	She	246	‘ When you become a wife , you become the core of your husband . ’
1729	1770	1771	1771	She	246	‘ Let him think he ’s in charge , let him think you ca n’t live without him , but never let him take your independence or identity , darling . They need their ego ’s stroked , these men . ’

1819	1823	1824	1824	Men	262	’ she insists . ‘
1829	1843	1824	1824	Men	262	’ I scoff . She has no idea how complicated my creature is . ‘

2027	2052	2053	2053	He	306	’m not about to stop him . I crave the constant contact , just as much as he does . Mum smiles at me . ‘
2068	2103	2061	2061	he	306	’re precious to him . It makes me and your father so happy to know that you ’ve found a man who adores you , a man who ’ll walk through fire for you . ’
2104	2111	2112	2112	I	2813	‘ I adore him , too . ’
2137	2153	2154	2154	She	246	‘ Please do n’t make me cry . My make - up will be ruined . ’
2169	2203	2204	2204	I	2813	‘ Yes , let ’s stop with the emotional stuff . Just do n’t ever do anything that you do n’t want to . I can also see he could be quite persuasive . ’
2216	2229	2230	2230	she	246	‘ It ’s such a shame his family could n’t be here . ’
2238	2249	2233	2233	I	2813	‘ I ’ve told you , they live abroad . They ’re
2254	2289	2233	2233	I	2813	’ I ’ve only vaguely outlined the reason for Jesse ’s lack of family . Very vaguely . The story that Jesse spun me when we first met sufficed . It ’s perfectly plausible . ‘
2292	2296	2233	2233	I	2813	’ she sighs . ‘
2306	2307	2233	2233	I	2813	’ ‘
2311	2324	2233	2233	I	2813	’ I agree . So do sex houses and playboy uncles . We ’re

2355	2368	2369	2369	Kate	2774	‘ I have drinks ! Wow , Elizabeth , you look incredible ! ’
2391	2398	2399	2399	she	246	‘ Are n’t you dressed yet ? ’
2445	2450	2451	2451	I	2813	‘ Just about to . ’
2464	2472	2473	2473	She	246	‘ Here , have one of these . ’
2483	2491	2492	2492	Mum	246	‘ Oh , yes , you must ! ’
2519	2533	2511	2511	She	246	‘ Oh , that little Italian knows how to keep a lady happy . ’

2592	2657	2660	2660	Jesse	306	’ She knows the cause of my nerves . I ’ve made Kate check the padlock and private suites a million times , too . She nods at the glass with raised eyebrows and I relent , taking a generous swig of Mario ’s Most Marvellous . It tastes as marvellous as ever , but no amount of alcohol is going to cure me . ‘
2662	2767	2660	2660	Jesse	306	’ I ask , setting my glass down . I ’ve not seen him since last night . Knowing my mum ’s traditional views , I insisted we sleep separately on the night before our wedding . He refused to leave my room until one minute to midnight , and then he did so in a mighty huff when my mum was banging on the door . I could see he was dying to trample all over her , but , surprisingly , he conceded without too much fuss , just a ferocious scowl at my mum as she guided him from the room . ‘
2775	2782	2770	2770	he	273	’ Kate downs a Most Marvellous . ‘
2790	2800	2783	2784	Katie Matthews	2774	’ Mum scorns , taking the glass from her . ‘
2809	2810	2783	2784	Katie Matthews	2774	’ ‘
2813	2837	2783	2784	Katie Matthews	2774	’ Kate flicks me a cheeky grin . I know why she ’s hitting the drink so early : theDan and Sam combination . ‘

2862	2867	2855	2856	the men	241	’ Kate emphasises all . ‘
2873	2877	2870	2871	the men	241	’ I ask . ‘
2887	2897	2870	2871	the men	241	’ Kate nods in agreement to my obvious thoughts . ‘
2914	3004	2906	2906	Jesse	306	’ I wince . Today is going to be tough for Kate . Dan delayed his return to Australia so he could be here for my wedding , but he has n’t said much , neither on the night of the proposal or since . He does n’t need to . It ’s obvious that he ’s struggling with both the direction of my life and being near Kate , especially with an oblivious Sam on the scene . Kate ’s struggling too , although trying to appear unaffected . ‘
3010	3016	2906	2906	Jesse	306	’ Kate claps her hands . ‘
3030	3037	3029	3029	I	2813	’m sure he wo n’t mind . ’
3059	3061	3054	3055	my mum	2774	‘ I ’m
3065	3085	3045	3045	She	280	’ I unpack my heels from the tissue paper and slip them on , raising me by four inches . ‘
3088	3111	3045	3045	She	280	’ I take a deep breath and make my way over to the door , where my dress is waiting for me . ‘
3125	3135	3138	3138	Ava	536	’ Mum suggests , joining me by the dress . ‘
3148	3164	3140	3140	I	2813	’ I hum my agreement , my eyes drifting up and down the full length . ‘
3176	3294	3295	3295	Jesse	306	’ I leave my mum admiring my dress and head for the bathroom , catching Kate having another quick glug while my mum ’s back is turned . If I was n’t so concerned about my wedding venue , I might be concerned about spending the day with Dan and Kate within spitting distance of each other . I shut the door quietly before using the toilet and relishing in another private moment . Then I hear a loud knock on the suite door , followed by the unmistakably panicked voice of my mother . Wondering what ’s going on , I make quick work of sorting myself out and washing my hands before exiting the bathroom . ‘
3297	3304	3295	3295	Jesse	306	’ My mum is clearly exasperated . ‘
3320	3323	3324	3324	I	2813	’re told . ’
3350	3356	3357	3357	I	2813	‘ What ’s going on ? ’
3360	3375	3376	3376	I	2813	‘ Jesse wants to see you , but Elizabeth is having none of it . ’
3408	3423	3426	3426	he	284	‘ We wo n’t fall out , mum , if you let me in . ’
3465	3479	3485	3485	you	286	‘ Jesse Ward , you do not get to call me mum when I ’m
3487	3491	3485	3485	you	286	’ she spits . ‘
3505	3506	3507	3507	Ava	536	’ ‘
3509	3577	3507	3507	Ava	536	’ he yells past my mum . I throw my eyes back to Kate , and she nods her head , instantly catching my drift . We both run towards the door , Kate unhooking my dress from the top and me gathering the bottom in my arms before we take it into the bathroom and rehang it on the back of the door . Kate laughs . ‘
3592	3593	3584	3584	she	287	’ ‘
3599	3640	3641	3641	Jesse	306	’ I smooth the front of my dress down and follow Kate back out , shutting the door behind me . Mum is still guarding the door , her foot wedged at the bottom . That wo n’t stop him . ‘
3645	3653	3641	3641	Jesse	306	’ She ’s pushing against him now . ‘
3673	3674	3679	3679	Elizabeth	215	’ ‘
3681	3746	3747	3747	Elizabeth	215	’ He ’s clenching his teeth , I know he is . I glace at Kate and shake my head . He ’s trampling my mother , just like he promised to do if she ever got in his way , and she is most certainly in his way . Kate takes another drink from the tray and walks casually over to the door . ‘
3766	3767	3760	3761	The man	288	’ ‘
3770	3803	3804	3804	He	288	’ Mum is really digging her heels in , not that it ’ll work . She should know this by now , even after the limited time she ’s spent with him . ‘
3814	3886	3811	3812	Jesse Ward	306	’ I smile to myself as I watch my determined mother shoved back slightly before being lifted from her feet and placed neatly to the side , giving Jesse access to me . She rearranges her dress and straightens her hairpiece , all the while spitting nails at my challenging man . Then I cast my eyes back to the open doorway . His eyes are green pools of desire and they ’re
3936	3939	3930	3930	He	288	‘ Well ! ’
3943	3951	3952	3952	She	246	‘ Ava , tell him to leave ! ’
3963	3976	3977	3977	His	288	‘ It ’s fine , mum . Just give us five minutes . ’
4067	4081	4054	4054	Kate	2774	‘ Come on , Elizabeth . Just a few minutes wo n’t hurt . ’
4082	4087	4088	4088	she	2774	‘ It ’s tradition ! ’
4114	4123	4130	4130	she	246	‘ What ’s that bruise on his chest ? ’
4182	4196	4178	4178	He	306	‘ I do n’t want to take my eyes away from your face . ’
4197	4200	4201	4201	He	306	‘ No ? ’
4207	4220	4221	4221	I	2813	‘ They ’ll be lace if I do , wo n’t there ? ’
4224	4228	4221	4221	I	2813	‘ White lace ? ’
4229	4232	4233	4233	His	306	‘ Ivory . ’
4238	4241	4233	4233	His	306	‘ And you ’re
4251	4289	4291	4291	Tessa	2774	’ I nod again . This could be dangerous for my hair , make - up and underwear if those eyes stray from my face . It could also be dangerous for our strict time schedule . I ’m
4301	4434	4300	4300	I	2813	’m ready before she hits me with how many steps it is to the summer room and how long it should take me to get there . He blinks a few times , and I know he ’ll never resist a peek ; he ’d just better control himself when he gets the full impact , and I ’d better control myself , too . It ’s hard . Sweat beads are trailing down his temple , across his neck and onto his solid chest , before shimmering as they travel the waves of his stomach and disperse in the waistband of his shorts . I shift as his eyes break from mine and lazily drag down my body , his chest heaving more severely as his gaze makes its journey . I ’m
4464	4472	4473	4473	I	2813	‘ You ’ve just trampled my mother . ’
4556	4563	4564	4564	he	222	‘ She was in my way . ’
4573	4580	4564	4564	he	222	‘ This is bad luck . You ’re
4590	4591	4564	4564	he	222	’ ‘
4595	4615	4616	4616	I	2813	’ His head dips so his lips brush over mine gently , but he does n’t touch my body . ‘
4621	4622	4616	4616	I	2813	’ ‘
4629	4660	4616	4616	I	2813	’ My voice is husky and inviting , even though I know I should n’t be encouraging contact when he ’s a mass of hard , muscled sweatiness , and I ’m
4674	4678	4679	4679	He	222	‘ Too long . ’
4698	4710	4697	4697	I	2813	’m instantly fighting the natural instinct to grab his big shoulders . ‘
4717	4722	4697	4697	I	2813	’ he accuses softly . ‘
4727	4734	4697	4697	I	2813	’ He ’s like a bloodhound . ‘
4742	4743	4697	4697	I	2813	’ ‘
4758	4889	4890	4890	Jesse	306	’ His lips push to mine , his tongue seeking entry , encouraging my lips to part and accept him into my mouth . The hot warmness of him dispels my nervousness ; , everything is forgotten as he claims me , but still keeps his hands to himself . Our sweeping tongues are the only contact between us , but it ’s as consuming as ever . My senses are saturated , my mind scrambled , and my body begging for him . But he just maintains the slow , fluid movements of his tongue , withdrawing occasionally to tease my lips , before plunging back into my mouth . I hum at his exquisite pace , the inevitable bang dropping between my thighs as he worships me delicately . ‘
4893	4902	4903	4903	I	2813	’re going to be late for our wedding . ’
4924	4936	4937	4937	He	306	‘ Do n’t tell me to stop kissing you , Ava . ’
4950	4959	4937	4937	He	306	‘ Never tell me to stop kissing you . ’
5008	5016	5017	5017	he	306	‘ Are you ready to do this ? ’
5024	5037	5021	5021	I	2813	‘ Are you asking me if I still want to marry you ? ’
5044	5055	5038	5038	His	306	‘ No , you do n’t get a choice . I ’m
5060	5063	5064	5064	I	2813	’re ready . ’
5076	5084	5073	5073	his	306	‘ And what if I say no ? ’
5085	5090	5097	5097	His	306	‘ You wo n’t . ’
5091	5096	5097	5097	His	306	‘ Then why ask ? ’
5109	5111	5106	5106	he	306	‘ You ’re
5123	5124	5125	5125	Jesse	306	’ ‘
5128	5134	5125	5125	Jesse	306	’m nervous because of where I ’m
5138	5144	5145	5145	Ava	536	’ His smile falls away . ‘
5164	5165	5154	5154	I	2813	’ ‘
5177	5200	5166	5166	I	2813	’ I drop my head , feeling a little guilty for doubting he ’d keep his word . I know exactly why we ’re
5234	5237	5238	5238	He	304	‘ Hey . ’
5254	5259	5238	5238	He	304	‘ Stop it now . ’

5265	5269	5270	5270	Ava	536	’ I grumble . ‘
5312	5335	5309	5309	I	2813	’ I shake myself out of my uneasiness and smile , feeling better for hearing his reassuring words . I believe him . ‘
5338	5400	5309	5309	I	2813	’ I watch as he stands and strolls over to a big chest , pulling something from the drawer and returning a few moments later with a bath sheet . My brow furrows as he drops back to his knees and wipes his face , then ruffles his damp hair before laying it across his front . He opens his arms . ‘
5404	5437	5309	5309	I	2813	’ he demands quietly , and I waste no time crawling onto his lap and letting him surround me in his arms , my cheek resting on his chest through the towel . ‘
5440	5449	5309	5309	I	2813	’ he asks , pulling me in closer . ‘
5453	5460	5309	5309	I	2813	’ I mumble into the towel . ‘
5468	5489	5465	5466	My Lord	2813	’ I grin . I feel him jerk a little under me , a silent hint of his quiet laugh . ‘
5497	5498	5499	5499	You	2813	’ ‘
5500	5505	5499	5499	You	2813	’re that , too . ’
5506	5523	5524	5524	I	2813	‘ And you are my temptress . Or you could be my Lady of The Manor . ’
5537	5549	5550	5550	He	2813	‘ I am not being the Lady of the Sex Manor ! ’
5576	5583	5550	5550	He	2813	‘ Whatever you want , lady . ’
5584	5590	5591	5591	I	2813	‘ Just lady will do . ’
5592	5611	5612	5612	I	2813	’m aware of my hands sliding all over his damp back , but I really do n’t care . ‘
5613	5620	5591	5591	I	2813	’m so in love with you . ’
5621	5629	5612	5612	I	2813	‘ I know you are , Ava . ’

5645	5646	5647	5647	You	2813	’ ‘
5656	5674	5675	5675	He	222	’ I smile and pull myself away from his body again . I need to see him . ‘
5684	5694	5695	5695	He	222	’ I reach up and cup his rough cheek . ‘
5700	5715	5695	5695	He	222	’ I whisper , searching his eyes , which are watching me so closely . ‘
5730	5733	5734	5734	I	2813	’m delirious . ’

5802	5812	5815	5815	he	222	’ he asks around my mouth . I grin . ‘
5821	5826	5827	5827	He	222	’ His eyes widen . ‘

5856	5882	5849	5849	He	222	’ I shrug , and he laughs . It ’s that eye sparkling laugh , the one that has light creases fanning his beautiful greens . ‘

5893	5897	5898	5898	He	222	’m shitting myself . ’
5907	5910	5898	5898	He	222	‘ But I ’m
5917	5950	5951	5952	Jesse Ward	306	’ I dive right in , smothering his face with my lips and humming in sweet contentment , but I do n’t get long to indulge myself . The door swings open . ‘
5963	5998	5999	5999	Ava	536	’ Mum ’s shocked cry pierces the privacy of our moment . I start laughing , my mum ’s scorn not stopping me from getting my fix of Jesse . And he lets me . ‘
6008	6017	6018	6018	Tessa	2774	’ Her angry heels start thumping towards us . ‘
6028	6051	6052	6052	Mum	246	’ I suddenly feel a mass of hands grasping at different parts of my body , trying to pull me from Jesse . ‘
6057	6065	6066	6066	I	2813	’ I laugh , gripping Jesse harder . ‘
6071	6072	6066	6066	I	2813	’ ‘
6078	6112	6113	6113	She	246	’re getting married in half an hour , your hair is a mess and you ’ve broken an ancient tradition , rolling around on the floor with your husband - to - be . ’
6121	6127	6113	6113	She	246	‘ Tessa , tell her ! ’
6128	6136	6137	6137	Tessa	2774	‘ Yes , come on , Ava . ’
6160	6165	6152	6153	the woman	246	‘ Okay , okay . ’
6176	6183	6184	6184	Mum	246	‘ Oh , look at you . ’

6240	6254	6235	6238	a pair of children	311	’ she continues , turning angry , chocolate eyes onto my challenging man . ‘

6262	6311	6312	6312	I	2813	’ He rises from the floor in one fluid effort , his delicious muscles bunching and rippling as he does . Tessa ’s staring does n’t escape my notice , but she soon snaps out of her dumbstruck state when she catches me watching her with raised eyebrows . ‘
6320	6328	6329	6329	Jesse	306	’ she declares , diverting her eyes . ‘
6334	6335	6329	6329	Jesse	306	’ ‘
6338	6345	6329	6329	Jesse	306	’ He looks at my chest . ‘
6351	6352	6348	6348	your	2813	’ ‘
6355	6373	6348	6348	your	2813	’ My hand instantly flies up to my breastbone , my eyes darting around on the floor . ‘
6382	6383	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ ‘
6386	6390	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ Jesse yells , ‘
6397	6398	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ ‘
6403	6426	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ Mum drops to her knees and starts looking under the bed , while I scan every inch of the plush carpet . ‘
6431	6456	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ Tessa sweeps it up from the floor , and Jesse abruptly snatches it from her hand before making his way over to me . ‘
6460	6487	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ he huffs , and I comply immediately , my heart hammering in my chest . That damn fucking diamond will be the death of me . ‘
6490	6505	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ His lips fall onto my shoulder , his hips pushing into my bum . ‘
6516	6520	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ Mum huffs . ‘
6525	6576	6384	6384	Ava	536	’ She starts tugging at Jesse ’s arm , but he does n’t brush her off . I turn and wave at him , then curtsy , prompting another huff from my mother and a cheeky grin from Jesse , before he lets Tessa usher him out of the suite . ‘
6590	6606	6583	6584	Ava O’Shea	536	’ I point to the bathroom and sit myself on the end of the bed . ‘
6621	6632	6633	6633	You	2813	’ I say haughtily . She stomps across the room . ‘
6642	6646	6633	6633	You	2813	’ she grumbles . ‘
6662	6672	6674	6674	he	2787	’ I stand and re - arrange my underwear . ‘
6677	6678	6674	6674	he	2787	’ ‘
6682	6686	6674	6674	he	2787	’ she asks . ‘
6707	6858	6700	6700	He	2787	’ He does . He ’ll be keen to hand me over to Jesse so he can escape the attention and blend back into the crowd . We had a brief conversation about speeches , and I could see the fear in his face . I told him he did n’t have to , but he insisted and so did my mum . My dress is removed from the hanger and held in front of me . I rest my hand on mum ’s shoulder and step into it , letting her pull it up my front so I can slip my arms through the delicate straps before she turns me around and fastens the dozens of tiny pearl buttons running down my lower spine . Her hands move to my shoulders to straighten the straps . She ’s quiet , and she ’s stopped moving . I know what I ’m
6869	6885	6886	6886	Mum	246	’m not sure I can cope with it . Then I hear a small sniff . ‘
6892	6900	6886	6886	Mum	246	’ Her hands kick back into action . ‘
6903	6926	6927	6927	Mum	246	’ I turn around , and my suspicions are confirmed . Her eyes are clouded and she lets out a small sob . ‘
6929	6934	6937	6937	Ava	536	’ I warn softly . ‘
6939	6988	6989	6989	I	2813	’ She runs to the bathroom , and I hear the frantic yanking of toilet paper from the roll , and then the blowing of a nose . I knew she would do this . She appears in the doorway , dabbing under her eyes with some tissue . ‘
6990	6999	6989	6989	I	2813	’m sorry . I was doing so well . ’
7000	7004	7005	7005	I	2813	‘ You were . ’
7008	7016	7005	7005	I	2813	‘ Hey , help me out here . ’
7025	7035	7022	7022	she	246	‘ Yes , yes . What should I do ? ’
7036	7039	7040	7040	I	2813	‘ Shoes . ’
7063	7067	7052	7052	she	246	‘ Thank you . ’
7082	7088	7089	7089	I	2813	‘ How ’s my face ? ’
7095	7112	7092	7092	She	246	‘ You mean after you ’ve just rubbed every inch of it all over Jesse ’s ? ’
7113	7116	7117	7117	I	2813	‘ Yes . ’
7130	7142	7143	7143	she	246	‘ You could probably do with an extra brush of powder . ’
7278	7280	7250	7250	I	2813	‘ I ’m
7283	7303	7306	7306	Joseph	464	’ I declare , coming to an abrupt halt when I see that my mum is no longer alone . ‘
7312	7382	7306	7306	Joseph	464	’ Mum cries , turning into my dad ’s shoulder and blubbering all over his charcoal three piece suit . Kate reaches up and strokes mum ’s back on a small eye roll , and dad tenderly wraps his arm around her waist . This is rare . He ’s not a touchy - feely man at all . I smile at him , and he returns my beam . ‘
7388	7393	7394	7394	I	2813	’ I warn him . ‘
7395	7399	7400	7400	He	2813	’m saying nothing . ’
7403	7419	7400	7400	He	2813	‘ Except , of course , how beautiful you look . Really beautiful , Ava . ’
7420	7423	7424	7424	I	2813	‘ Really ? ’
7442	7447	7448	7448	He	2813	‘ Yes , really . ’
7452	7459	7460	7460	He	2813	‘ Now , are you ready ? ’
7487	7491	7475	7475	he	2813	‘ Yes , I ’m
7503	7545	7496	7496	Dad	2779	’ I demand , and that has the desired effect , everyone laughing at my order . Much better . I ca n’t cope with all of this intensity . Jesse provides me with enough of that . Tessa barges in . ‘
7557	7571	7572	7572	Elizabeth	215	’ she asks , scanning the bodies that are all staring at me . ‘
7580	7588	7589	7589	Ava	536	’ She escorts them from the room . ‘
7603	7612	7589	7589	Ava	536	’ She leaves me and my dad alone . ‘
7627	7636	7589	7589	Ava	536	’ I tease . His face screws up . ‘
7641	7642	7589	7589	Ava	536	’ ‘
7656	7669	7589	7589	Ava	536	’ I pick up my calla lily — just one calla lily . ‘
7680	7696	7589	7589	Ava	536	’ He cocks his arm to the side , and I link it with mine . ‘
7699	7786	7589	7589	Ava	536	’ I nod and let my dad lead me down to the summer room , where my Lord of the Sex Manor is waiting for me . Chapter 2 Kate and Tessa are waiting for us outside the doors to the summer room , my wedding planner looking pleased , Kate looking tipsy . I maintain my steady breathing , feeling my dad getting all tense next to me . I flick a glance up to him , but he keeps his attention directed firmly forward . ‘
7789	7801	7802	7802	I	2813	’ Kate asks , bending down to spread my dress neatly . ‘
7807	7813	7802	7802	I	2813	’re not wearing a veil . ’
7814	7818	7819	7819	Tessa	2774	‘ Oh no , ’
7823	7832	7833	7833	She	2774	‘ This dress does n’t need a veil . ’
7844	7852	7833	7833	She	2774	‘ He wants to see my face . ’
7867	7889	7866	7866	I	2813	’m about to do is suddenly overwhelming me . This is it . I can feel my chest expanding , and I ’m
7907	7939	7941	7942	Etta James	70	’m walking down the aisle to him . How did this happen ? The doors to the summer room open , music immediately drifting to my ears . Only now when I ’m
7943	7991	7941	7942	Etta James	70	’ At Last does it occur to me I did n’t even pick the music for my wedding . I ’ve done absolutely nothing . I have no idea what ’s happening or when . My eyes are flying all over the floor at my feet and I ’m
8329	8335	8336	8336	he	2779	‘ Give me your hand . ’
8468	8555	8467	8467	I	2813	’m released from my dad ’s hold before he makes his way to the front to join Elizabeth , her shocked whisper attacking him as he arrives by her side . My eyes drift over the congregation , noting all of the people who know Jesse are smiling , the ones who do n’t displaying wide eyes and gaping mouths . Kate and Sam are chuckling , John ’s flashing his gold tooth , and then there ’s my brother . He ’s not impressed . I ’m
8624	8630	8631	8631	I	2813	‘ What are you doing ? ’
8655	8661	8635	8635	He	335	‘ You look so fuckable . ’
8672	8679	8662	8662	I	2813	‘ Jesse , people are waiting . ’
8680	8686	8687	8687	He	335	‘ Then they ’ll wait . ’
8696	8707	8710	8710	he	335	‘ I really , really , really like this dress . ’
8772	8777	8763	8763	I	2813	‘ Mr Ward , you ’re
8782	8791	8763	8763	I	2813	’ I feel him grin against my ear . ‘
8803	8804	8763	8763	I	2813	’ ‘
8811	8827	8763	8763	I	2813	’ He pulls back and hits me with his smile , reserved only for me . ‘
8837	8854	8833	8835	my beautiful girl	2813	’ He joins our handcuffed hands and starts leading me down the aisle . * * * ‘
8857	8869	8833	8835	my beautiful girl	2813	’ He hands me a half - full flute of champagne . ‘
8877	8910	8874	8875	Mrs Ward	72	’ I take the glass with my free hand before he can withdraw his offer . He ’s been even more unreasonable about me drinking lately , and I know exactly why . ‘
8920	8924	8874	8875	Mrs Ward	72	’ I ask . ‘
8927	8932	8933	8933	You	343	’ he answers swiftly . ‘
8934	8943	8944	8944	He	343	’re not leaving my side all day long . ’
8956	9130	8955	8955	I	2813	’m suddenly reminded that I ’ll never enjoy a drink with Jesse , not even on our wedding day . I glance around the bar , seeing everyone chatting , nibbling on canapés and drinking champagne . It ’s relaxed and calm , just how I feel myself . After Jesse insulted all things traditional , we made our vows and he took it upon himself to drown me in his mouth — prior to getting the go ahead from the registrar . Then he picked me up and strode out of the summer room , leaving my poor mother chasing behind , demanding he wait for the music . Not a chance . I was placed neatly on my stool at the bar and smothered with his lips while the congregation made their way in behind us . Dan catches my attention across the room . He ’s being so quiet , and his attention is constantly pointed in Kate ’s direction , which means it ’s also pointed in Sam ’s . ‘
9137	9148	8955	8955	I	2813	’ I pull my attention back to Jesse and smile . ‘
9151	9166	8955	8955	I	2813	’ He rests his palm on the back of my neck and massages me . ‘
9171	9172	8955	8955	I	2813	’ ‘
9175	9181	8955	8955	I	2813	’ I answer quickly . I ’m
9189	9204	9205	9205	He	345	‘ Good , then my work here is done . Kiss me , wife . ’
9215	9222	9205	9205	He	345	‘ You ’ve upset my mother , ’
9227	9239	9223	9223	I	2813	‘ She ’ll get over it . I said kiss me . ’
9240	9255	9256	9256	I	2813	‘ I do n’t think she will . You ’ve ruined her big day . ’
9257	9260	9256	9256	I	2813	’m grinning . ‘
9271	9293	9269	9269	Ava	536	’ he warns , and I reach up and pull him down to me , giving him exactly what he wants . ‘
9296	9306	9269	9269	Ava	536	’ Mums shrill voice stabs at my ear drums . ‘
9314	9322	9323	9324	Jesse Ward	306	’ She starts fiddling with my wrist . ‘
9340	9352	9361	9361	Elizabeth	215	’ He pulls back and narrows his eyes on my mum . ‘
9363	9373	9361	9361	Elizabeth	215	’ She gasps and throws irritated eyes at me . ‘
9380	9381	9384	9384	him	2786	’ ‘
9386	9464	9470	9470	darling	2813	’ I declare , and she fights a fond smile from her cherry red lips . She ’s desperate to maintain her grievance , but I know she loves him , too . I know she loves how much he loves me , and while he infuriates her , he also charms her , a he does all women . Just because Elizabeth happens to be my mother , does n’t make her immune to his potency . ‘
9472	9494	9467	9467	you	2813	’ She clucks my cheek and turns her attention to the bar , calling Mario for some of his Most Marvellous . ‘
9497	9511	9512	9513	The photographer	349	’ Tessa dives over to us and takes my glass from my hand . ‘
9548	9582	9583	9583	We	350	’ I watch as my glass is placed on the bar before she makes a grab for Jesse ’s water , but he swipes it away , leaving Tessa grabbing at thin air . ‘
9584	9594	9595	9595	Jesse	306	’re not in the photos , I told you . ’
9598	9600	9595	9595	Jesse	306	‘ We ’re
9603	9618	9619	9619	You	351	’ I blurt , completely shocked . He ’s trampling that tradition , too ? ‘
9626	9630	9619	9619	You	351	’ Tessa insists . ‘
9637	9669	9670	9670	Tessa	2774	’ She looks horrified . I bet she ’s wishing she ’d never taken us on . Or taken Jesse on ; I ’ve had nothing to do with this day . ‘
9679	9688	9670	9670	Tessa	2774	’ Jesse orders . It ’s that voice . ‘
9697	9705	9706	9706	We	353	’ I look at him in horror . ‘
9707	9714	9706	9706	We	353	’re not in the family shots ? ’
9726	9729	9730	9730	he	2813	‘ No . ’
9734	9746	9747	9747	He	2813	‘ You ca n’t begrudge her a photo with her daughter ! ’
9762	9771	9772	9772	I	2813	‘ You do it to her on purpose . ’
9775	9777	9772	9772	I	2813	‘ We ’re
9781	9782	9785	9785	we	353	’ ‘
9786	9789	9790	9790	he	2813	’re not . ’
9812	9827	9806	9806	He	2813	‘ We are having photographs . This is my wedding , too , Ward . ’
9841	9854	9828	9828	His	355	‘ But I want some quiet time . Just me and you . ’
9855	9857	9806	9806	He	2813	‘ We ’re
9861	9878	9828	9828	His	355	’ I say , full of authority . I feel a sulk coming on , but I ’m
9941	9947	9948	9948	he	2813	‘ Come on , then . ’
9991	9997	9990	9990	I	2813	’m not sure , but we ’re
10087	10094	10081	10081	I	2813	‘ Please , just do what you ’re
10097	10118	10081	10081	I	2813	’ The more he plays up , the longer this will take and the more stressed my mum will get . ‘
10127	10128	10081	10081	I	2813	’ ‘
10135	10142	10129	10129	I	2813	’ I say on a laugh . ‘
10150	10204	10145	10145	I	2813	’ he grumbles , and I smile . I know he does . Jesse spends the next hour cooperating completely . He moves when asked , smiles when requested , and even releases me from the cuffs without complaint when I have some shots on my own . On the final click , I ’m
10221	10264	10308	10308	he	306	’re alone in one of The Manor ’s suites — the suite where he cornered me and tried to seduce me , and the suite where I got myself ready for our wedding . The door closes softly behind us , and I ’m
10303	10307	10308	10308	he	306	‘ Quiet time . ’
10327	10333	10334	10334	I	2813	‘ You want to snuggle ? ’
10341	10345	10346	10346	He	306	‘ I do . ’
10350	10366	10346	10346	He	306	‘ I want to snuggle with my wife . Are you going to deny me ? ’
10367	10370	10387	10387	he	306	‘ No . ’
10371	10386	10387	10387	he	306	‘ Good . Our marriage is getting off to the best start , then . ’
10573	10622	10572	10572	I	2813	’m still far too curious about his knowledge of Jesse ’s drinking issue . And then there ’s my period , which is due on Monday . I ’ve never wished so hard for something . A baby ? I ca n’t even think about that , and I ’m
10745	10804	10744	10744	I	2813	’m not pregnant . I ’ve no idea what I ’ll do if I am . I know he ’ll be looking for signs of my period , and I ca n’t hide that from him . I ’ve been making him wear condoms for two weeks , and he ’s clearly demonstrated his disgust , but if I ’m
10817	10825	10826	10826	I	2813	‘ Will you do something for me ? ’
10830	10833	10834	10834	His	306	‘ Anything . ’
10875	10883	10869	10869	his	306	‘ What do you want , baby ? ’
10884	10895	10896	10896	I	2813	‘ Can you please resist talking to Patrick about Mikael ? ’
10926	10979	10980	10980	I	2813	’m not sure Jesse can hold himself back . Things have been quiet on the Mikael front , and I ’ve been allowed to work , even if he does call constantly . I would n’t be at all surprised if Jesse knows that my Danish client is out of the country . ‘
11000	11058	10993	10993	I	2813	’ He raises expectant eyebrows at me . No , I have n’t , because I have no idea how to approach this . He was shocked enough to hear that I was marrying one of my clients just a short time after taking on the contract . I could hardly hit him with the shock that I ’m
11104	11110	11111	11111	I	2813	‘ Give me until Monday . ’
11114	11123	11111	11111	I	2813	‘ I ’ll talk to him on Monday . ’
11124	11127	11128	11128	he	374	‘ Monday . ’
11136	11152	11128	11128	he	374	‘ I mean it , Ava . You ’ve got till Monday , and then I ’m
11156	11157	11128	11128	he	374	’ ‘
11160	11175	11128	11128	he	374	’ He grunts a little , and then buries himself back in my neck . ‘
11178	11183	11128	11128	he	374	’ he mumbles again . ‘
11194	11195	11196	11196	I	2813	’ ‘
11224	11236	11218	11218	You	377	’ He lifts his head and points a scowl at me . ‘
11261	11262	11263	11263	You	2849	’ ‘
11270	11275	11269	11269	I	2813	’m not working , I ’m
11290	11300	11301	11301	I	2813	’m technically connected to you all day , anyway . ’
11314	11323	11324	11324	he	379	‘ I want you to give up working . ’
11330	11366	11368	11371	a lady of leisure	380	’m shaking my head , just like I have every time he ’s suggested this . He ’s not demanding yet , but that ’s coming , most likely when Mikael rears his ugly head . ‘
11373	11377	11368	11371	a lady of leisure	380	’ he presses . ‘
11388	11394	11395	11395	His	379	’m permanently nailed to you ? ’
11412	11423	11424	11424	He	379	‘ Okay . Be a lady of pleasure , then . ’
11469	11494	11495	11495	He	379	‘ Ward , you are not taking me now . Anyway , we should get downstairs before my mum comes in search of us . ’
11502	11504	11505	11505	mother	2774	‘ You ’re
11514	11515	11505	11505	mother	2774	’ ‘
11524	11542	11543	11543	She	2774	’ I laugh . He shifts off me and pulls me to the edge of the bed . ‘
11552	11568	11569	11569	You	382	’ he says candidly , starting to re - cuff me . My amusement increases . ‘
11570	11581	11582	11582	I	2813	’re touching me . Of course you have the power . ’
11621	11623	11615	11615	He	379	‘ I ’m
11626	11639	11615	11615	He	379	’ He shakes our wrists , instigating another clanking of the handcuffs . ‘
11645	11651	11652	11652	You	382	’ I scowl at him . ‘
11660	11673	11674	11674	You	382	’ I brush my hair over my shoulder and rearrange my diamond . ‘
11675	11680	11681	11681	he	379	’re being very reasonable . ’
11717	11720	11721	11721	he	379	‘ Hmmm . ’
11724	11734	11735	11735	I	2813	‘ You taste delicious , Mrs Ward . Ready ? ’
11742	11745	11746	11746	I	2813	‘ Yes . ’
11747	11884	11746	11746	I	2813	’m all breathy and hot . His eyes drift down to my stomach , and his hand slowly lifts . I flinch when his hand connects , and he freezes , his fingers resting lightly on my belly . I do n’t know why that happened . He does n’t look up , he just waits a few silent moments before spreading his fingers , and then circling big , soft , rings on my stomach . I wish he would stop doing this . Neither one of us has spoken about it , but it ca n’t be avoided for much longer . He must sense my lack of enthusiasm . This little situation is my biggest burden of all . I do n’t want a baby . I pull back and his hand drops . ‘
11890	11906	11746	11746	I	2813	’ I ca n’t look at him . I start towards the door , but I ’m
11930	11941	11942	11942	he	306	‘ Are we going to talk about this , Ava ? ’
11946	11951	11952	11952	I	2813	‘ Talk about what ? ’
11989	12012	12013	12013	You	384	’m in complete denial , I realise that , but it ’s hitting me harder each day . I could be pregnant . ‘
12017	12054	12013	12013	You	384	’ I keep my eyes down , not knowing what else to say . Time seems to slow , enhancing the awkward silence between us , and as I hear him draw breath to speak when I ’m
12080	12085	12086	12086	she	385	‘ Can I ask , ’
12092	12117	12086	12086	she	385	‘ why you two did n’t just run off somewhere to get married ? You have guests downstairs , dinner is being served and I ’m
12129	12130	12131	12131	We	386	’ ‘
12132	12135	12136	12136	I	2813	’re coming . ’
12148	12158	12159	12159	Jesse	306	‘ We ’ll be a few minutes , Elizabeth . ’
12163	12167	12159	12159	Jesse	306	‘ No , we ’re
12170	12200	12159	12159	Jesse	306	’ I argue , silently begging him to leave this exactly where it is . I give him pleading eyes , and he shakes his head on a sigh . ‘
12203	12284	12159	12159	Jesse	306	’ I say quietly . His hand delves into his hair in frustration and his jaw tightens severely . He ’s not happy , but he relents and lets me pull him from the room . I ca n’t believe he has chosen today of all days to push for a talk on this . It ’s my wedding day . We make our way downstairs , the silence between us remaining uncomfortable , but my mum is oblivious . I ’m
12459	12520	12521	12521	Jesse	306	’m close to tears as I watch him battle his way through his post - it notes , reminiscing on my youth , advising every one of my feisty streak , and then proceeding to tell them about the time I got caught shoplifting a penny sweet and ate the evidence . He raises his glass and turns towards us . ‘
12526	12689	12521	12521	Jesse	306	’ he says seriously , prompting a chorus of laughter from all of our guests and a huge smile from Jesse , who raises his glass , too , then stands himself , keeping his arm down so he does n’t yank at my wrist . My dad is applauded as he sits and downs a straight whiskey , my mum rubbing his shoulder on a smile . Jesse places his water on the table and turns towards me , dropping to his knees and taking my hands in his . My back straightens , and my eyes make a quick scan of the room , noting all attention is pointed right at us . Why ca n’t he play by the rules ? His thumbs are working fast circles on the backs of my hands , and then he plays with my rings , turning them on my finger before straightening them up . He lifts his glorious greens , and I ’m
12706	12758	12759	12759	Ava	536	’m avoiding something we really do need to talk about . After my continuous battle to get this man talking , it ’s now me who ’s skirting around things . It ’s me running away from it , even if I am running away from a problem he ’s created . ‘
12761	12783	12759	12759	Ava	536	’ he says quietly , but I ’ve no doubt the whole room can hear him . The silence is screaming . ‘
12788	12793	12795	12795	mine	536	’ He smiles mildly . ‘
12797	12806	12795	12795	mine	536	’ Leaning up , he kisses me sweetly . ‘
12826	12838	12825	12825	I	2813	’m not interested in satisfying anyone of that . Except you . ’
12857	12936	12854	12854	He	395	‘ You ’ve taken me completely , baby . You ’ve swallowed me up and drowned me in your beauty and spirit . You know I ca n’t function without you . You ’ve made my life as beautiful as you are . You ’ve made me want to live a worthy existence — a life with you . All I need is you — to look at you ; to listen to you ; to feel you . ’
12949	12954	12937	12937	He	396	‘ To love you . ’
12956	12986	12955	12955	I	2813	’m ruined . My mum ’s ruined . Everyone in the room is ruined . My teeth are clamped on my bottom lip to prevent a sob escaping , I ’m
13011	13037	13002	13002	I	2813	‘ I need you to let me do all of those things , Ava . I need you to let me look after you forever . ’
13078	13105	13106	13106	I	2813	’m destined for a life of devastating pleasure , melting tenderness , and heart stopping emotion . He ’s going to incapacitate me at every turn . ‘
13109	13262	13106	13106	I	2813	’ I whisper . He nods and exhales a long lungful of air before standing and pulling me up to his body . My face falls straight into his neck , and I breathe him into me , his fresh , minty scent prompting me to close my eyes on a contented sigh . The room is no longer silent . When I pull out of Jesse ’s hold , I see people standing everywhere , a steady , respectful clapping of hands resonating through the room . I should feel embarrassed , but I do n’t . He ’s just spoken to me like we were alone , proving that he really does n’t care where he is and who ’s there — wherever and whenever , as it always has been and as it always will be . I watch as my mum approaches and throws her arms around Jesse . ‘
13270	13285	13266	13266	I	2813	’ she says in his ear , as he holds her with one arm , ‘
13295	13296	13302	13302	Elizabeth	215	’ ‘
13304	13320	13302	13302	Elizabeth	215	’ She releases him and slaps his shoulder , and then Kate dives on him . ‘
13331	13404	13325	13325	I	2813	’ I roll my eyes , getting my arm yanked all over the place while people congratulate my neurotic ex - playboy on his little speech . It ’s our wedding day , and I do n’t want to be here . All of these people , including Kate and my mother , are getting in my way . I want him all to myself , but evening guests are arriving so we ’re
13438	13441	13429	13429	he	306	‘ Ava ? ’
13546	13591	13545	13545	I	2813	’m thinking , and I know he ’s not happy about it , but he still reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small key . Without a word , he releases me from the cuffs and leaves them dangling from his wrist . ‘
13594	13724	13542	13542	He	306	’ he says quietly , flicking threatening eyes at Dan . Dan gives as good as he gets , flashing an equally warning glare . I do n’t need this , not with two of the most important men in my life . I know why Dan is cautious , even if he does n’t know the whole story , and I know damn well why Jesse is . Dan ’s a threat . He ’s my brother , but he ’s still a threat . In Jesse ’s eyes , anyway . I lean up to kiss Jesse ’s cheek and feel his hand glide around my hips , smoothing over my bum before he rips his eyes away from Dan and turns his face into my lips . ‘
13730	13743	13542	13542	He	306	’ he says , releasing me and striding off towards the bar . ‘
13747	13771	13542	13542	He	306	’ I hold my hand out to Dan , and he takes it , letting me lead him out to the gardens . We ’re
13882	13885	13865	13865	I	2813	‘ Oh ! ’
13886	13889	13890	13890	Dan	464	‘ Careful . ’
13898	13910	13911	13911	he	464	‘ I do n’t think those shoes were made for hiking . ’
13922	13925	13926	13926	I	2813	‘ No , ’
13933	13936	13937	13937	he	464	‘ Ava … ’
13948	13972	13941	13941	I	2813	‘ Just say it , Dan . Whatever you ’ve been dying to say since you ’ve met Jesse , just say it . ’
13973	13982	13983	13983	I	2813	‘ Okay . I do n’t like him . ’
13993	13996	13988	13988	He	464	‘ Okay , ’
14001	14012	14013	14013	He	464	‘ I did n’t think you ’d be so blunt . ’
14016	14025	14013	14013	He	464	‘ What do you want me to say ? ’
14026	14059	14060	14060	I	2813	‘ You do n’t even know him . The only attempt you ’ve made to speak with him , to get to know him , was when you tried to warn him . ’
14100	14109	14110	14110	he	464	‘ Explain about this drink issue , then . ’
14117	14124	14125	14125	I	2813	‘ What are you talking about ? ’
14140	14142	14125	14125	I	2813	‘ I ’m
14204	14297	14185	14185	Mum	246	’ I knew it was too much of a good thing . After Jesse ’s sly stunt of getting my parents to London , they fell in love with him and the drink issue was n’t mentioned again . They put it down to Matt being spiteful . I do n’t need Dan unearthing an issue that really is n’t an issue . Jesse has n’t had a drink since I found him at Lusso . He does n’t need it if he has me , and he most definitely has me . ‘
14304	14308	14309	14309	I	2813	’ he asks . ‘
14321	14322	14314	14314	He	411	’ ‘
14325	14329	14314	14314	He	411	’ He laughs . ‘
14341	14342	14339	14339	Matt	264	’ ‘
14346	14355	14356	14356	I	2813	’re suddenly a Matt advocate , are you ? ’
14383	14415	14375	14375	I	2813	‘ There is no issue . He has no family , so back off . Let ’s talk about what ’s really eating you up . Let ’s talk about Kate . ’
14439	14453	14438	14438	I	2813	’m not going to let him ruin my day with his judgments . They ’re
14466	14473	14474	14474	he	264	‘ Nothing ’s eating me up ! ’
14477	14487	14474	14474	he	264	‘ I could n’t give a fuck about Kate ! ’
14488	14492	14493	14493	I	2813	‘ Of course ! ’
14496	14512	14493	14493	I	2813	‘ That ’s why you ’ve barely pulled your eyes away from her all day . ’
14513	14521	14522	14522	His	264	‘ Who the hell is that Sam ? ’
14575	14582	14583	14583	I	2813	‘ He ’s good for her . ’
14634	14645	14628	14628	I	2813	‘ You need to leave this exactly where it is . ’
14664	14673	14659	14659	he	464	‘ What if I do n’t want to ? ’
14674	14682	14659	14659	he	464	‘ Get your fucking hands off her . ’
14712	14718	14703	14703	he	306	‘ It ’s fine . We ’re
14721	14758	14759	14759	She	71	’ I say , yanking my arm free . I need to get Jesse away before he tramples all over my brother . And it wo n’t just be a verbal trample . Dan steps forward . ‘
14764	14776	14777	14777	She	71	’ Jesse closes the gap between them , his eyes black . ‘
14784	14886	14782	14782	Wife	82	’ My brother laughs a little , not a good thing , judging by Jesse ’s darkening glare . I need to intervene , but stepping between these two angry men is not a thought I relish . But then I see Jesse ’s fists balling , and I know I need to remove him now . I place my hand on his arm and he flinches , too focused on Dan to realise it ’s me . As soon as he does , though , he breaks the glowering deadlock and turns his eyes to mine . They soften immediately . ‘
14891	14920	14782	14782	Wife	82	’ I say quietly , sliding my hand down his arm to grasp his . He nods and turns with me , not giving Dan another look . I ’m
14989	14995	14996	14996	Jesse	306	‘ Give me your hand . ’
15013	15023	15002	15002	I	2813	‘ Do n’t ask me to remove them again . ’
15024	15028	15029	15029	I	2813	‘ I wo n’t ’
15068	15074	15075	15075	His	464	‘ Throw away the key . ’
15079	15089	15075	15075	His	464	‘ Wishing you ’d have stayed nailed to me ? ’
15090	15093	15094	15094	I	2813	‘ Yes . ’
15097	15104	15094	15094	I	2813	‘ Do n’t free me again . ’
15105	15108	15109	15109	he	464	‘ Okay , ’
15112	15119	15120	15120	We	417	‘ Would you like a drink ? ’
15134	15141	15120	15120	We	417	‘ I ’d love a drink . ’
15153	15162	15152	15152	I	2813	’m a little surprised that he ’s offered . ‘
15166	15176	15152	15152	I	2813	’ He pulls me in and kisses my forehead . ‘
15193	15194	15195	15195	I	2813	’ ‘
15198	15204	15195	15195	I	2813	’ I agree quietly . I ’m
15294	15317	15293	15293	we	422	’re accosted , kissed and wished well with every step we take . When we finally make it to the bar , I ’m

15461	15471	15472	15472	I	2813	‘ Do n’t you want to cut the cake ? ’
15489	15504	15480	15480	Jesse	306	‘ Kate went out of her way to make it on such short notice . ’
15513	15521	15522	15522	he	306	‘ Then let ’s not ruin it . ’

15531	15650	15522	15522	he	306	’ I sigh , glancing across the bar , spotting Sam and Drew entertaining my dad , who ’s looking a little rosy cheeked . My mum is revelling in the attention , undoubtedly offering tours of the grounds , and Kate is looking drunk . Tom flaps a limp wrist at me , Victoria gives a girly wave before looking across the bar towards Drew and smoothing down her blonde locks , and poor Sal just looks like she ’s trying to fit in , although she ’s still sparkling , but her new fellow is n’t here . I smile and turn my attention back to Jesse , just a Tessa storms back into the bar . ‘
15659	15663	15664	15664	We	426	’ Tessa huffs . ‘
15665	15685	15686	15686	She	215	’re cutting the cake and having the first dance shortly , so do n’t be disappearing on me again . ’

15728	15746	15747	15747	You	306	’m not . I ’ve fallen out with my brother , and that has absolutely never happened . ‘
15762	15794	15795	15795	I	2813	’ I inwardly laugh . Then he should let me have a drink and he should n’t have broached the subject that has my brain the most twisted at the moment . ‘

15864	15875	15856	15856	I	2813	‘ Here ’s Patrick . You said Monday , remember ? ’
15890	15901	15884	15884	Jesse	306	‘ Yes , Ava . Just till Monday , though . ’

16472	16481	16482	16482	He	306	‘ Ava , I ’ll be back shortly . ’
16490	16498	16482	16482	He	306	‘ No ! Where are you going ? ’
16504	16510	16499	16499	I	2813	‘ Where is he going ? ’
16511	16517	16529	16529	I	2813	‘ S’all good , girl . ’
16518	16528	16529	16529	I	2813	‘ No . It ’s not all fucking good ! ’
16576	16581	16582	16582	he	306	‘ Watch your mouth ! ’
16589	16605	16582	16582	he	306	‘ I ’ll be a few minutes . You ’ll stay fucking put , Ava . ’
16629	16724	16628	16628	I	2813	’m perched on a barstool , the bride in a stunning gown , adorned with diamonds , all of our guests laughing , chatting and drinking , and I want to go home . I feel tearful , slighted and very , very hurt . I lower myself from the stool , deciding to make the most of my freedom and have a wee . I might have a little cry , too . I need to get away from these people before the tears start flowing freely . What is wrong with me ? ‘
16732	16783	16730	16730	darling	56	’ Mum asks as she makes her way over . I spread a fake smile on my face . She ’s had too much Most Marvellous . Her hair is n’t perfect and she does n’t seem to care , a clear indication that she ’s feeling a bit squiffy . ‘
16792	16793	16786	16786	I	2813	’ ‘
16801	16809	16810	16810	She	56	’m not sure where Kate ’s gone . ’
16816	16824	16810	16810	She	56	‘ No , I ’ve got it . ’
16865	16905	16864	16864	I	2813	’m not a blushing bride anymore . There is no twinkle in my eye or happy smile on my face . I sigh heavily and pinch my cheeks in an attempt to get some colour back into them . I ’m
16912	16917	16864	16864	I	2813	‘ Ohhh myyy Goddd ! ’
17009	17015	16999	16999	I	2813	‘ What are you doing ? ’
17066	17070	17071	17071	she	2774	‘ Oh shit ! ’
17081	17088	17071	17071	she	2774	‘ Could n’t you have waited ? ’
17112	17115	17116	17116	she	2774	‘ Ava … ’
17138	17141	17133	17133	My	2813	‘ Dan ? ’
17148	17156	17157	17157	He	448	‘ What the hell are you doing ? ’
17198	17218	17219	17219	I	2813	’re just standing there , both looking anywhere , except at me . I throw furious eyes at Dan . ‘
17226	17237	17239	17239	you	450	’ I shout , before turning my fury on Kate . ‘
17240	17256	17239	17239	you	450	’re pissed ! What ’s the matter with you two ? Have n’t you learnt ? ’
17257	17265	17266	17266	Dan	464	‘ None of your business , Ava . ’
17286	17289	17290	17290	I	2813	‘ Kate ? ’
17314	17319	17320	17320	I	2813	‘ What about Sam ? ’
17333	17340	17323	17325	The poor bloke	453	‘ I ca n’t believe this . ’
17374	17377	17378	17378	she	452	‘ Fun . ’
17382	17393	17378	17378	she	452	‘ And it ’s got nothing to do with you . ’
17394	17399	17400	17400	I	2813	‘ Oh , okay , ’
17407	17420	17400	17400	I	2813	‘ I ’ll leave you to have your fun in that case . ’
17514	17598	17503	17503	I	2813	’re at our happiest — when the world and its problems are not interfering with our little bubble of contentment , where we only have our own issues to contend with . I steam down the corridor and straight into his office , my heart falling straight into my Louboutins as soon as I lay my eyes on the occupants . There are just two people . Jesse … and Coral . Chapter 4 My day just got a whole lot worse . They ’re
17898	17943	17897	17897	I	2813	’m doubtful I can maintain the strength I clearly need to spend my life with Jesse — spend my life fighting off women and problems … issues . The tears I ’ve been holding back jump straight from my eyes onto my lace . I ’m
18094	18098	18084	18084	I	2813	‘ I know you ’re
18101	18112	18113	18113	I	2813	’ I say quietly , keeping my eyes pointing downwards . ‘
18118	18254	18113	18113	I	2813	’ His evenly spaced steps crunch over the ground , getting louder as he nears , and in my peripheral vision , I see him lower himself next to me . But he does n’t touch me . His hands are clasped in front of him , his thumbs circling each other slowly . I can hear the tail end of his heavy breathing subsiding . He ’s been running around the grounds like a madman trying to find me , and now he ’s just sitting next to me , all silent when he should be explaining himself , explaining why he abandoned me on our wedding day so he could see a woman who ’s in love with him — another woman who ’s in love with him . I laugh to myself . ‘
18261	18284	18285	18285	I	2813	’re so in touch with each other , yet you sit here now and do n’t know what to say to me ? ’
18356	18362	18363	18363	I	2813	‘ So he touches me . ’
18367	18372	18373	18373	he	477	‘ He loves you . ’
18376	18389	18373	18373	he	477	‘ He wishes he could eliminate the past that ’s hurting you . ’
18403	18437	18390	18390	I	2813	‘ Then why did you see her ? On our wedding day , when you vowed to have me by your side all day , why did you desert me to see her ? ’
18438	18453	18390	18390	I	2813	‘ I could n’t leave her at the gates with guests arriving , Ava . ’
18454	18462	18390	18390	I	2813	‘ So tell her to go away . ’
18463	18469	18390	18390	I	2813	‘ And cause a scene ? ’
18470	18476	18477	18477	I	2813	‘ What did she want ? ’
18487	18497	18498	18498	His	477	‘ Did she know we were getting married today ? ’
18518	18524	18511	18511	his	477	‘ Yes , she knew . ’
18532	18567	18526	18526	he	477	‘ And she still came ? Was she hoping to stop it ? Was she going to barge through the summer room doors and declare that we should n’t be joined in holy matrimony ? ’
18572	18580	18581	18581	He	477	‘ I do n’t know , Ava . ’
18585	18593	18594	18594	He	477	‘ When did you speak to her ? ’
18597	18615	18594	18594	He	477	‘ She ’s been calling and turning up at The Manor . I ’ve told her repeatedly I ’m
18630	18641	18629	18629	I	2813	’m not sure what else I can do , Ava . ’
18642	18651	18652	18652	I	2813	‘ What ’s your definition of an affair ? ’
18668	18674	18655	18655	His	477	‘ What do you mean ? ’
18675	18702	18703	18703	I	2813	‘ I mean , she ’s in love with you , and you ’ve said it was only sex . It was obviously more to her . ’
18713	18743	18744	18744	I	2813	‘ Baby , I ’ve told you before , just sex . They always wanted more , but I never gave them any reason to expect it . Never . ’
18850	18861	18862	18862	I	2813	‘ I do n’t want you to see her again . ’
18872	18883	18865	18865	He	477	‘ I wo n’t . I ’ve no need to . ’
18896	18911	18884	18884	I	2813	‘ I ’ve had enough of my wedding . I ’d like to leave . ’
18912	18919	18920	18920	he	477	‘ Ava , look at me . ’
18924	18934	18920	18920	he	477	‘ Jesse , do n’t start making demands when I ’m
18939	18940	18920	18920	he	477	’ ‘
18956	18973	18949	18949	I	2813	’ He ’s not asking gently now , but my despondency prevents me from defying him . ‘
18976	19001	19002	19002	I	2813	’ I ask , following through on his unreasonable order . He falls to his knees in front of me and takes my hands . ‘
19008	19049	19007	19007	I	2813	’m so sorry , but I was trying to keep her away from you . I panicked and thought I could talk some sense into her . I did n’t want her kicking up a stink on your special day . ’
19050	19059	19060	19060	I	2813	‘ It ’s your special day , too . ’
19065	19073	19060	19060	I	2813	‘ You should ’ve just told me . ’
19074	19078	19079	19079	He	2813	‘ I know . ’
19089	19110	19111	19111	I	2813	‘ Let me make it up to you . What do you want me do , baby ? Name it . ’
19116	19123	19124	19124	I	2813	‘ Just take me to bed . ’
19128	19131	19132	19132	He	2813	‘ Deal . ’
19147	19155	19156	19156	He	2813	‘ We ’ll make friends properly later . ’
19180	19190	19179	19179	we	485	’re immediately attacked by my mother ’s infuriated glare . ‘
19195	19208	19209	19209	You	487	’ She scuttles towards us , still tipsy , but obviously annoyed . ‘
19233	19261	19262	19262	I	2813	’ I want to do none of those things . Evening guests are here , and we should socialise , but I just ca n’t be bothered . ‘
19263	19272	19273	19273	He	488	’m taking Ava upstairs . She ’s tired . ’
19290	19312	19289	19289	I	2813	’m being carried through the summer room , through all of our guests , and he is n’t stopping for anyone . ‘
19320	19329	19289	19289	I	2813	’ She ’s horrified , as I expected . ‘
19335	19336	19289	19289	I	2813	’ ‘
19353	19359	19360	19360	His	488	’m sure they ’ll survive . ’
19371	19382	19383	19383	She	306	‘ Ava , please . Talk some sense into him . ’
19444	19449	19437	19437	I	2813	‘ A little longer . ’
19461	19468	19455	19455	he	2765	‘ We can give her longer . ’
19469	19471	19455	19455	he	2765	‘ You ’re
19474	19492	19455	19455	he	2765	’ He ’s frowning a little . Yes , I am tired , but not physically . I ’m
19496	19506	19455	19455	he	2765	‘ Let me take you to bed , baby . ’
19507	19512	19513	19513	I	2813	‘ Dance with me . ’
19532	19537	19540	19540	him	2765	‘ Let ’s dance . ’
19558	19562	19563	19563	Mum	246	‘ Thank God ! ’
19571	19669	19570	19570	I	2813	’m placed on my feet in the middle of the dance floor before he makes his way over to the band and speaks into the lead singer ’s ear . He nods and smiles , then everyone clears the floor and it ’s just me , feeling conspicuous and exposed . And then the singer removes himself from the stage , along with all of the other band members , and Snow Patrol breaks the silence with Chasing Cars . He turns to face me and just stands there , watching me for the longest time . I ’m
19766	19768	19771	19771	baby	306	‘ I ’m
19773	19781	19782	19782	I	2813	’ he says quietly into my hair . ‘
19783	19790	19791	19791	I	2813	’m sorry I left you earlier . ’
19826	19833	19834	19834	He	420	‘ Let ’s leave it there . ’
19847	19863	19834	19834	He	420	‘ The harder I try not to hurt you , the more I do . I ’m

19877	19881	19882	19882	He	420	’m still sorry . ’

19901	19905	19906	19906	I	2813	‘ Me either . ’
19918	19928	19929	19929	I	2813	‘ Tomorrow , we stay in bed all day . ’
19932	19940	19929	19929	I	2813	‘ We need to go home first . ’
19952	19972	19973	19973	We	499	’re staying here tonight . All of the rooms have been prepared for guests , mainly for my family . ‘
19984	20018	20019	20019	We	499	’ I demand quietly . I know it ’s rude , leaving our guests , but I do n’t want to face Kate , and I definitely do n’t want to face Dan . ‘
20022	20026	20019	20019	We	499	’ he agrees , ‘
20041	20069	20070	20070	I	2813	’ I let him gently rock me , my eyes closing again and my mind relaxing a little , letting Jesse draw all of my stress away . ‘

20108	20167	20168	20169	Mrs Ward	72	’ I smile to myself . Yes , she would have had a lot to say about it . Opening my eyes , I see her pulling my reluctant dad to the floor , and then Kate and Sam follow with Victoria and Tom . I let my eyes close again and melt into Jesse and his movements . ‘
20178	20183	20168	20169	Mrs Ward	72	’ he asks quietly . ‘

20277	20292	20293	20294	Mr Ward	306	’m locked tightly against his chest , our tongues gliding softly between our mouths . ‘

20321	20337	20317	20317	He	2813	‘ Let me see those eyes . I show him what he wants to see . ‘
20347	20363	20317	20317	He	2813	’ I ask . He only smiles mildly , but his greens still twinkle madly . ‘
20377	20380	20381	20381	I	2813	’re real . ’

20485	20495	20498	20498	me	2813	’ I nod mildly . I really do understand . ‘
20500	20524	20498	20498	me	2813	’ I move my hands to the back of his head and relish the feel of his dark blonde hair between my fingers . ‘

20556	20560	20561	20561	I	2813	’ I shrug . ‘

20616	20620	20612	20612	I	2813	’ He frowns . ‘

20768	20842	20845	20845	Justin	92	’ He raises his eyebrows . He ’s right . It does n’t , but I do n’t confirm it . He ’s just lowering to pick me up when Snow Patrol fades out and is replaced with something else — something much louder and upbeat . I can feel my face breaking out in a smile as I watch Jesse freeze mid bend , and then the male ’s voice kicks in . ‘
20847	20888	20891	20892	Mrs Ward	72	’ I say quietly , watching him straighten up . He steps back thoughtfully and grabs the lapels of his suit jacket , giving them a little tug before brushing them off and hitting me with wide , excited eyes . ‘

20965	21008	20964	20964	I	2813	’m seized and reminded of my God ’s moves . He does , indeed , tear the floor up . Chapter 5 A whole hour later after Jesse has won my mum over and graced everyone with his dance floor presence , I ’m
21068	21082	21067	21067	I	2813	’m placed on my feet . My forehead falls straight to his chest . ‘

21582	21598	21539	21539	I	2813	‘ Yes , but he ’ll be gone soon . What about Kate and Sam ? ’

I wince at the direction of my thoughts and try to concentrate on the feel of him gathering my hair and pulling it to the side . The unmistakable heat of his lips on my nape dispels them completely . I shiver , and he laughs . ‘

We ’ve got way too much hard fucking to catch up on . I feel his hand land on the back of my head , and he yanks at my hair a little . I smile to myself in smug satisfaction , then slip the button of his trousers and slowly pull his zipper down , sliding my hand into his boxers and firmly grabbing his rock - hard length . His hips fly up , the metal of the cuffs clanking loudly . ‘

I ’ve taken him endlessly like that and it ’s never had this effect . Shit , I feel queasy . I grab some toilet tissue and dab at my forehead . I really need to get a grip and get my arse back in there to release him before he has heart failure . ‘
23511	23557	23561	23561	I	2813	’ There ’s an almighty crash , and then he steams into the bathroom , shirt open , trousers undone , and a look of pure dread on his face . I try to wave an arm at him , anything to reassure him that I ’m

23971	23993	23994	23994	Jesse	306	’ I agree feebly , catching a glimpse of a hanging handcuff from his wrist … and a huge red blister . ‘
24001	24057	24058	24058	You	540	’ I grab his hand and turn it over , discovering the inner side on his wrist displaying a mass of angry red welts . I suck in a shocked breath . Shit , that looks sore . He pulls his wrist from my grip and removes the cuffs , throwing them to the floor . ‘

26136	26143	26127	26127	I	2813	‘ I ’ve told you A … ’
26144	26158	26159	26159	I	2813	‘ Do n’t tell me it ’s none of my business , Jesse . ’
26165	26176	26159	26159	I	2813	‘ She ’s my best friend . I feel like I ’m
26191	26192	26185	26185	I	2813	’ ‘
26205	26211	26212	26212	You	573	’ he scorns me harshly . ‘
26213	26216	26217	26217	He	571	’re done . ’
26239	26244	26245	26245	He	571	‘ Wash your hair . ’
26257	26276	26277	26277	He	571	‘ Maybe you could show as much concern for a little detail in our relationship that needs addressing . ’
26328	26351	26327	26327	I	2813	’m still not ready , and I notice that his new talking ability is only used on subjects of his choice . I ’m
26377	26500	26501	26501	Darling	61	’m dealing with this in my own way . And that way is to wedge my head as far underground as I can get it . * * * We walk into restaurant of The Manor hand in hand and are immediately greeted by loud clapping and cheering . The first things I notice , apart from the noise , is Kate ’s obvious hangover , and across the room , Dan ’s glacial glare , pointed right at Jesse . My husband either notices neither or ignores them both , because he scoops me right up and strides through the tables , places me neatly on a chair opposite my mum and dad , then takes one up next to me . ‘
26503	26514	26501	26501	Darling	61	’ My mum ’s excited shriek hammers at my ears . ‘
26528	26537	26541	26541	Elizabeth	215	’ She glares across the table at Jesse . ‘
26543	26567	26541	26541	Elizabeth	215	’ Jesse beams at my mum , and she rolls her eyes , but I can tell she ’s restraining a fond smile . ‘
26574	26584	26572	26572	Joseph	464	’ My dad nods while carving through a sausage . ‘
26595	26596	26597	26597	We	576	’ ‘
26609	26630	26604	26604	you	61	’ Jesse casts his eyes around the restaurant , obviously checking that the staff is seeing to the remaining guests . ‘
26634	26638	26604	26604	you	61	’ Dad laughs . ‘
26668	26685	26687	26687	they	578	’ I smile at my dad and his graciousness , his manners never failing him . I ’m
26691	26699	26700	26700	I	2813	‘ Is Dan going back with you ? ’
26708	26718	26719	26719	mum	246	‘ Oh no , has he not told you ? ’
26748	26753	26754	26754	I	2813	‘ Told me what . ’
26764	26774	26754	26754	I	2813	‘ He ’s staying in London for a while . ’
26790	26795	26775	26775	Mum	246	‘ He ’s what ? ’
26796	26803	26804	26804	I	2813	‘ Staying in London , darling . ’
26837	26840	26841	26841	I	2813	‘ Why ? ’
26844	26855	26841	26841	I	2813	‘ I thought he has the surf school to expand . ’
26882	26892	26869	26869	Jesse	306	‘ He says there ’s no rush , and I ’m
26896	26916	26869	26869	Jesse	306	’ Mum accepts a coffee from Pete , and then he places one in front of me , too . ‘
26923	26936	26940	26940	Pete	95	’ he confirms . I look up at him and smile fondly . ‘
26941	26958	26940	26940	Pete	95	’ I place my toact back on my plate and Jesse immediately picks it up again . ‘
26961	26969	26940	26940	Pete	95	’ He thrusts it in my hand . ‘
26978	26992	26993	26993	Ava	536	’ I spit harshly , halting all chopping and sipping at our table . ‘
26997	27018	27020	27020	myself	2813	’ Jesse recoils , and I can feel my mum and dad ’s shocked stares from across the table . I ’m
27058	27099	27057	27057	I	2813	’m not naive enough to think that his dislike of Jesse and concern for me is his reason for staying . I ignore Jesse ’s incredulous stare and my parent ’s dumbstruck faces , and get up from the table . ‘
27105	27111	27112	27112	Ava	536	’ Jesse stands with me . ‘
27117	27176	27112	27112	Ava	536	’ His tone is warning , even in front of my parents , but I should know by now that he could n’t give a flying fuck where he is and who is present . He ’ll be mad at me or ravish me wherever and whenever he likes . My parents are n’t going to stop him . ‘
27186	27203	27184	27184	Jesse	306	’ I go to pass him , but his hand flies out and grasps my wrist . ‘
27207	27219	27220	27220	I	2813	’ He laughs . I look him straight in the eye . ‘
27230	27231	27220	27220	I	2813	’ ‘
27239	27268	27269	27269	Ava	536	’ He pulls me back down onto my chair and places my toast in my hand , then leans into me , pressing his mouth to my ear . ‘
27299	27316	27317	27317	I	2813	’ His hand moves to my knee and strokes up the inside of my bare thigh . ‘
27322	27517	27518	27518	Jesse	306	’ he whispers . I smile sweetly at my parents across the table , who have resumed eating their breakfast . He has nerve . Have some respect for my parents ? My teeth clench when he brushes the seam of my knickers and blows in my ear . He was losing the battle , so he saturates me with his touch to regain the power . Damn him . I squeeze my thighs together and pick up my coffee with shaking hands while he continues to wreak havoc on me with his hot breath in my ear , and my parents continue happily with their breakfast . They ’ve spent time with us , and they have fast become used to Jesse ’s craving for constant contact . He pulls away and hits me with a smug , satisfied stare . Yes , he ’s won now , but only because he ’s absolutely right . This really is n’t the time or the place , especially with my mum and dad here . I know Jesse wo n’t be all that delighted by the news my mum has just disclosed , either . ‘
27524	27533	27518	27518	Jesse	306	’ Dad pipes up , completely shocking me . ‘
27540	27541	27518	27518	Jesse	306	’ ‘
27544	27550	27518	27518	Jesse	306	’ My mum agrees quickly . ‘
27557	27574	27518	27518	Jesse	306	’ I do n’t have to look at my husband to know his smugness has just expanded ‘
27580	27596	27578	27578	Joseph	464	’ His knee knocks mine under the table , and I knock him right back . ‘
27604	27613	27615	27616	my wife	420	’ Mum smiles across the table at us . ‘
27620	27629	27615	27616	my wife	420	’ Jesse replies dryly , eyeing my toast . ‘
27637	27647	27635	27635	lady	420	’ I nibble a corner of toast and shrug . ‘
27669	27683	27664	27665	My husband	420	’ I turn accusing eyes on him , and he grins at me . ‘
27690	27694	27695	27695	You	585	’ I ask . ‘
27697	27698	27695	27695	You	585	’ ‘
27703	27704	27695	27695	You	585	’ ‘
27723	27732	27736	27736	you	585	’ He reaches over and straightens my diamond . ‘
27737	27740	27741	27741	I	2813	’re mine . ’
27767	27772	27773	27773	she	2774	‘ Oh , Joseph . ’
27776	27786	27773	27773	she	2774	‘ Do you remember being that much in love ? ‘
27793	27797	27789	27789	I	2813	’ Dad laughs . ‘
27809	27938	27801	27801	I	2813	’ He brushes his mouth with his napkin and stands . Mum does n’t reply . She ’s too busy smiling fondly across the table at us . My dad leaves the restaurant , and I turn my attention to Kate . She looks terrible , her skin looking even paler than usual and her vibrant red hair appearing dull . She ’s picking at some cornflakes while Sam chats buoyantly to her , seemingly oblivious to her despondent state . It ’s obvious that she ’s struggling with more than just a bad head and a queasy tummy . Sam ca n’t be that ignorant . My eyes leave Sam and Kate and travel back across the room to Dan . He ’s still staring at her . ‘
27946	27961	27801	27801	I	2813	’ Jesse asks quietly when he ’s obviously caught the direction of my gaze . ‘
27975	27985	27986	27986	You	590	’ I answer without taking my eyes from Dan . ‘
28004	28028	28029	28029	I	2813	’ My eyes shoot to Jesse ’s profile , but he ignores my shock and stands when my mum rises from the table . ‘
28039	28087	28097	28097	She	71	’ She brushes her skirt down and leaves the room , giving Kate a shoulder rub en - route . Kate smiles a little , then looks over at me , but quickly diverts her eyes elsewhere . I sigh to myself and wonder what on earth I ’m
28127	28137	28138	28138	I	2813	‘ You want me to warn my brother off ? ’
28152	28183	28141	28141	He	71	‘ I think he needs to be told . I do n’t want to upset you by doing it myself , so perhaps you should have a word with him . ’
28219	28226	28227	28227	I	2813	‘ I ’ll speak to him . ’
28237	28244	28227	28227	I	2813	‘ And before you start , I ’m
28248	28249	28250	28250	You	594	’ ‘
28257	28275	28276	28276	I	2813	’ He makes a play for my breakfast again , and I slap my hand over his . ‘
28277	28281	28282	28282	I	2813	’m not hungry . ’
28291	28298	28282	28282	I	2813	‘ Can we go home now ? ’
28313	28323	28299	28299	He	71	‘ We can go home now . Come on . ’
28346	28389	28345	28345	I	2813	’m deposited in the DBS and taken back to Lusso . My home — the place where Jesse and I will live together as husband and wife . I open the door and step out , letting out a shocked yelp when I ’m
28395	28400	28401	28401	I	2813	‘ I have legs . ’
28411	28425	28426	28426	He	71	‘ And I have arms , and they were made to hold you . ’
28448	28450	28458	28458	I	2813	‘ I ’m
28459	28467	28458	28458	I	2813	’m not letting you out until morning . ’
28468	28471	28472	28472	I	2813	‘ Deal . ’
28486	28686	28689	28689	Clive	90	’m not feeling like fucking softly . My attention moves to the concierge desk when Jesse stops abruptly and his eyes widen . My eyes widen slightly , too . Standing behind the desk with a phone to his ear is a man — and it ’s not Clive . It most certainly is not Clive . I purse my lips and grin to myself . Oh , this is going to provoke some serious possessive , trampling - like behaviour . I remain silent as I assess the situation . It does n’t take much assessing , though . Jesse is standing in the middle of the foyer , the new concierge is still speaking on the phone , and they are both staring at each other . The new concierge ’s eyes fall on me , and I almost laugh when I hear a growl emanate from Jesse . Oh good Lord , this poor man is going to get trampled to within an inch of his life . I firm up my grip on Jesse ’s shoulders and wait for him to take the initiative and walk on , but he ’s rooted to the spot . ‘
28691	28725	28689	28689	Clive	90	’ he asks the new guy , disregarding his phone conversation . I wriggle a little to try and free myself , but Jesse just flips me a glare and tightens his hold . ‘
28733	28734	28735	28735	You	2813	’ ‘
28736	28742	28735	28735	You	2813	’re behaving like a caveman . ’
28743	28749	28750	28750	He	90	‘ Shut up , Ava . ’
28771	28774	28775	28775	Jesse	306	‘ Clive . ’
28856	28878	28879	28879	he	602	‘ I ’ll be working alongside Clive , sir . I was supposed to start my new position some time ago , ’
28883	28894	28895	28895	He	602	‘ Personal reasons delayed the commencement of my employment here . ’
28906	28908	28909	28909	Casey	95	‘ I ’m
28930	28976	28977	28978	Mr Ward	306	’ He shifts awkwardly . I wriggle again to free myself , feeling like a complete idiot locked in my possessive Lord ’s grasp while the new concierge introduces himself . He seems sweet and sincere enough , but Jesse is n’t letting me go . ‘
28980	28991	28977	28978	Mr Ward	306	’ Jesse says shortly , ignoring Casey ’s outstretched hand . ‘
28999	29062	28997	28997	Casey	95	’ I put my hand out to him , but Jesse steps back . Oh for the love of God ! I look at him , noting his eyes planted firmly on the young man in front of us . He ’s being ridiculous . I force myself from his grip with some effort and step forward , offering my hand again . ‘
29069	29120	29067	29067	Casey	95	’ I smile , and he takes my hand , shaking it mildly . The poor guy wo n’t come back if I do n’t intervene . Clive has been here non - stop since the residents moved in . He ’s no spring chicken . He needs the relief . ‘
29133	29159	29162	29162	you	95	’ He smiles , and it ’s a cute smile , but I do n’t miss the cautious look that he directs over my shoulder . ‘
29163	29168	29162	29162	you	95	’re in the penthouse ? ’
29169	29176	29162	29162	you	95	‘ Yes , that ’s us . ’
29177	29191	29162	29162	you	95	‘ Maintenance called to say your new front door has arrived from Italy . ’
29192	29200	29162	29162	you	95	‘ That ’s great , thank you . ‘
29201	29209	29210	29210	Jesse	306	‘ Have maintenance fit it without delay . ’
29213	29219	29220	29220	Casey	95	‘ Already done , sir . ’
29235	29254	29220	29220	Casey	95	’ Jesse swipes them from the poor guy ’s hand before virtually throwing his car keys at him . ‘
29260	29262	29220	29220	Casey	95	’ I ’m
29281	29292	29293	29293	He	306	’m pushed inside and then up against the mirrored wall . ‘
29297	29301	29293	29293	He	306	’ Jessee growls . ‘
29308	29309	29302	29302	You	306	’ ‘
29318	29321	29322	29322	He	306	’re mine . ’
29346	29366	29345	29345	I	2813	’m delighted . This is not gentle Jesse . This is powerful , forceful , dominant Jesse , and I ’m
29404	29406	29407	29407	yours	306	‘ I ’m
29409	29419	29407	29407	yours	306	’ I pant between hard lashes of his tongue . ‘
29428	29470	29407	29407	yours	306	’ His hand feels up my leg and cups me harshly , triggering hot wetness to invade me and an excited thud to attack my core . I really need this . His finger slips past the seam of my lace . ‘
29473	29480	29407	29407	yours	306	’ he purrs into my mouth . ‘
29487	29488	29489	29489	I	2813	’ ‘
29492	29503	29489	29489	I	2813	’ My muscles grip his finger as he enters me . ‘
29506	29530	29489	29489	I	2813	’ I beg unashamedly . I need more . He separates our mouths and withdraws his finger , re - entering with two . ‘
29534	29541	29545	29545	Ava	536	’ He pushes hard and high . ‘
29547	29564	29545	29545	Ava	536	’ My head falls back against the mirror , my mouth gaped , my eyes closed . ‘
29569	29570	29545	29545	Ava	536	’ ‘
29581	29623	29573	29573	you	536	’ His voice is carnal and a massive surprise , given his delicate approach to my body in recent weeks . If this is the effect that Casey will have on my Lord , then I hope he stays forever . I ’m
29695	29703	29688	29688	He	606	‘ You have n’t answered my question . ’
29704	29709	29710	29710	I	2813	‘ I want this . ’
29723	29730	29731	29731	He	606	‘ I want you inside me . ’
29763	29772	29778	29778	I	2813	‘ I knew you were a sensible girl . ’
29779	29797	29778	29778	I	2813	’m carried out into the penthouse foyer , where the door is opened without delay , and we ’re
29808	29819	29778	29778	I	2813	‘ You make me a desperate fucking mess , Ava . ’
29821	29876	29820	29820	I	2813	’m placed on the edge of the bed and my dress is pulled up over my head quickly before he yanks his t - shirt off , kicks his Converse to the side and pushes his jeans down his legs , taking his white boxers with them . He really is desperate , and I ’m
29892	30067	29891	29891	I	2813	’m pushed back onto the bed and my knickers are pulled down my legs , my bra disposed of just as quickly . He ’s working fast , but it ’s still not quick enough . My impatience is my undoing — that and his glorious nakedness looming over me . I need to touch him . I sit up and slide my hands around his solid arse and pull him forward so he ’s standing between my spread thighs , his lower stomach at my eyelevel . Placing my lips gently in his abdomen , I trail kisses across to his scar , but it does n’t make me wince anymore . It ’s a massive imperfection , a mar on his beautiful body , but it just makes him all the more perfect to me . My perfect imperfect Adonis . My God . My husband . I feel his fingers thread through my hair , and my eyes creep up the firmness of his abs , then his chest , until I ’m
30112	30127	30111	30111	I	2813	’m desperate for his ferocity , desperate for him to stop treating me like I ’m
30169	30263	30168	30168	I	2813	’m feeling his neck out and pulling him down to meet my lips . I lift myself gracefully to his body and link my legs around his waist , feeling his arm snake around me , holding me to him as he accepts my demand for mouth contact . Heavy mouth contact . Indulgent mouth contact . All consuming mouth contact . He does n’t lower me to the bed . He walks me into the bathroom and straddles the chaise lounge , standing me over him . He looks up at me . ‘
30270	30272	30168	30168	I	2813	’ I ’m
30281	30293	30294	30294	he	614	‘ No one will ever stop me taking you , Ava . ’
30305	30308	30294	30294	he	614	‘ Good . ’
30349	30356	30357	30357	He	614	‘ My girl wants it hard . ’
30363	30402	30362	30362	I	2813	’m the one growling this time . He stares up at me , panting and sweating . He wants to give it me as well ; I can see it in the glaze of his green stare . They ’re
30416	30490	30415	30415	I	2813	’m gently tugged down as he holds himself upright , ready to enter me , but I stiffen , preventing him from seizing me . I might be desperate for him , but I still have to maintain my sensibility , just like I ’ve done over the past few weeks . He ’s not wearing a condom , and judging by the sharper tug of my arm , he knows exactly why I ’m
30494	30497	30498	30498	My	2813	‘ Jesse , ’
30509	30513	30515	30515	you	615	‘ Ava , I ’m
30520	30531	30532	30532	He	616	’re not going to stop me with trivial fucking requests . ’
30610	30614	30615	30615	he	616	‘ Oh Jesus , ’
30621	30625	30615	30615	he	616	‘ Fucking perfect . ’
30632	30655	30631	30631	I	2813	’m swiftly reminded of the perfection that is no barrier between us . Just flesh on flesh . Me on him . I ’m
30668	30671	30631	30631	I	2813	‘ Move . ’
30675	30679	30672	30672	I	2813	‘ Please move . ’
30680	30695	30696	30696	He	616	‘ In time , baby . Just let me feel you for a moment . ’
30860	30874	30859	30859	I	2813	’m lifted from his body again and grinded down , slowly and meticulously . ‘
30887	30891	30859	30859	I	2813	’ he moans . ‘
30903	30908	30909	30909	He	616	’re supposed to be . ’
30919	30923	30909	30909	He	616	‘ Not ever . ’

31163	31210	31157	31157	We	623	’ His eyes clench shut and he goes rigid against me . He ’s being too gentle with me . I need shock and awe . I need him to take me hard . It has been like this for weeks . And I know why . ‘
31220	31233	31157	31157	We	623	’ I nuzzle into his neck , sucking and biting at him . ‘

31249	31290	31157	31157	We	623	’ That wo n’t have the desired effect . Yes , I ’ll come , I ’ll moan in pleasure and shake all over him , but I need to scream a release . I need scrubbing , not dabbing . ‘
31296	31311	31294	31294	Jesse	306	’ He sucks in a sharp breath as I force myself down , hard . ‘

31962	31974	31975	31975	He	536	‘ You wanted it , Ava . Is that fucking better ? ’
31981	32045	31980	31980	I	2813	’m pinned against the wall , absorbing his ferocious attack , and I want it even harder . I ’ve had two weeks of gentle Jesse . I ’ve had enough of gentle Jesse , but I ca n’t speak . I bore down on every advance , my signal that I do want it harder . I want it so much harder . ‘

32055	32064	31980	31980	I	2813	’ I scream , grappling at his hair . ‘

32113	32154	32155	32155	I	2813	’m knocked out by my climax that rushes forward so fast , I do n’t have a chance to prepare myself for it . I explode , my eyes clenching shut , my head thrown back on a desperate scream . ‘
32156	32163	32164	32164	he	2813	’m not done yet , Ava . ’

32448	32465	32447	32447	I	2813	’m sky high on pleasure . But then I feel my back leaving the wall as I ’m
32550	32554	32555	32555	Jesse	306	’m soaking wet . ‘
32557	32568	32555	32555	Jesse	306	’ I scream his name in delirious , delightful despair . ‘
32580	32724	32573	32573	Ava	536	’ He bangs into me again , harder still . He ’s releasing all of the pent up , animalistic power he ’s been suppressing for way too long . He ’s really lost control , and a small part of me is wondering if he ’s doing this on purpose — trying to shock me or scare me back into the realms of sleepy sex . He ’s going to fail miserably if that ’s his plan . My body needs this . I need this . I drag my twisted mind back to now and focus on meeting his power with acceptance . I accept all of it , the violent accumulation of pressure in my belly working its way straight to my core , ready for detonation . This is going to blow my brain clean out of my head . ‘
32727	32736	32737	32737	Ava	536	’ I shout , grasping at the sheets . ‘
32739	32765	32737	32737	Ava	536	’ His fingers flex on my hips and clamp down , the unforgiving hold on my sensitive area not bothering me in the slightest . I ’m
32847	32891	32846	32846	I	2813	’m utterly exhausted , but I feel so much better . It feels like us again . He groans , his groin circling deeply , the fire of his release heating me and putting me back together again . I ’ve missed it . ‘
32895	33027	32846	32846	I	2813	’ I pant , closing my eyes and finding immense comfort in his strong , frantic heartbeat clattering against my back . I ca n’t even muster up the strength to be concerned that he has just come inside me . Not that it really matters . He does n’t say anything . The only sound in the colossal master suite is our collective , erratic breathing . It ’s loud , it ’s heavy and it ’s satisfied . But then he breaks away from me , and the absence of his warmth coating my body makes me immediately turn over to see what he ’s doing . He ’s walking away , his hands clenching his head , as I watch his naked back disappear into the bathroom . I ’m
33232	33268	33231	33231	I	2813	’m staring at him . He ’s staring at me . Sitting up and pulling my knees to my chest , I feel small and awkward . It should n’t be like this between us . ‘
33276	33316	33231	33231	I	2813	’ His jaw ticks and his neck muscles bulge . The words , spoken with no remorse or regret , widen my eyes and straighten my back . His face is expressionless , and even though I knew , I ’m
33337	33347	33348	33348	He	222	‘ I said I ’ve been taking your pills . ’
33385	33425	33426	33426	Ava	536	’m certain it ’s not going to arrive . This man , my crazy husband , has just completely and unashamedly confessed to stealing my birth control pills , and now my denial is converting into blood boiling fury . ‘
33434	33444	33432	33432	woman	536	’ His hands fly to his head in frustration . ‘
33453	33487	33432	33432	woman	536	’ I do n’t even try to reason because there is absolutely nothing reasonable about this situation . As I pace towards him , he watches me closely , cautiously , and when I ’m
33509	33544	33508	33508	I	2813	’m too angry to focus on the pain . His head has turned to the side , his eyes are down , and I can still only hear our fitful breathing , except now they ’re
33552	33566	33570	33570	I	2813	’re anger fuelled gasps . He brings his face back up and before I ’m
33571	33660	33570	33570	I	2813	’m doing , my hand is flying out again , but this time he catches my wrist in front of his face . I yank myself free and proceed to thump his chest with both fists in a frenzied lash out of anger . And he lets me . He just stands there and takes my deranged beating , my fists persistently striking him as I scream and wail . When I think I might collapse with exhaustion , I step back and lose control of my tears . ‘
33663	33726	33727	33727	You	222	’ I shout at him . He does n’t try to touch me or come towards me . He just remains standing in the doorway , still with no emotion on his face . His frown line is n’t even there , but I know he must be concerned , and he must be really concentrating on not restraining his deranged wife . ‘
33741	33749	33734	33734	I	2813	’ His voice is soft and even . ‘
33759	33760	33761	33761	I	2813	’ ‘
33784	33830	33774	33774	I	2813	’ His frown line has arrived . So has the nibbled lip . I do n’t know why he ’s thinking so hard about this . Nothing can detract from the fact that this is plain fucked up . He is fucked up , and I ’m
33840	33846	33847	33847	He	222	‘ You make me crazy . ’
33852	33862	33847	33847	He	222	‘ You make me do crazy shit , Ava . ’
33863	33870	33871	33871	I	2813	‘ So it ’s my fault ? ’
33874	33887	33888	33888	I	2813	‘ My pills started going missing only days after you took me . ’
33907	33911	33896	33896	He	222	‘ I know . ’
33950	33998	33999	33999	My	2813	‘ You do n’t get to evade your reasons for this . You ’ve taken it upon yourself to dictate my life direction . I do n’t want a fucking baby ! This is my body ! You do n’t get to make these decisions for me ! ’
34007	34020	33999	33999	My	2813	‘ Tell me why the fucking hell you did this to me ! ’
34021	34030	34031	34031	he	222	‘ Because I wanted to keep you forever . ’
34042	34049	34034	34034	I	2813	‘ You wanted to trap me ? ’
34050	34053	34054	34054	His	222	‘ Yes , ’
34059	34078	34054	34054	His	222	‘ Because you knew I ’d run when I found out about your business and your drinking problem ? ’
34079	34082	34083	34083	He	222	‘ Yes . ’
34090	34113	34114	34115	This man	222	‘ But I came back after I found out about The Manor and the alcohol , yet you still took my pills . ’
34120	34130	34114	34115	This man	222	‘ You did n’t know about my history then . ’
34131	34136	34114	34115	This man	222	‘ I do now . ’
34137	34141	34114	34115	This man	222	‘ I know . ’
34142	34148	34149	34149	My	2813	‘ Stop saying you know ! ’
34159	34176	34158	34158	I	2813	’m losing control again . His eyes lift , but they do n’t meet mine . They ’re
34192	34201	34202	34202	he	222	‘ What do you want me to say ? ’
34233	34260	34232	34232	I	2813	’m walking out on him , but I have no clue of what else to do . I grab my ripped jeans and yank them on . ‘
34266	34328	34329	34329	Ava	536	’ His voice is full of the fear I knew it would be . He ’ll never cope with this , but neither will I if I stay . This has suddenly hit me very hard . I do n’t answer him , instead focusing on getting my bra and t - shirt on before I yank down an overnight bag . ‘
34338	34347	34348	34348	You	639	’ The bag is snatched from my hand . ‘
34349	34354	34355	34355	His	639	’re not leaving me . ’

34402	34407	34391	34391	He	639	‘ Ava , please . ’
34408	34412	34413	34413	My	2813	‘ Please what ? ’
34462	34471	34477	34477	him	639	‘ Please , Ava , do n’t go . ’
34561	34565	34566	34566	Ava	536	’m so confused . ‘
34576	34583	34566	34566	Ava	536	’ I swing around in shock . ‘
34586	34591	34566	34566	Ava	536	’ He nods sheepishly . ‘

34759	34766	34753	34753	I	2813	‘ What about what I want ? ’
34767	34773	34753	34753	I	2813	‘ But I love you . ’
34787	34804	34805	34805	Ava	536	’m seriously losing the plot . I walk past him and quickly make my way downstairs . ‘
34807	34847	34848	34848	Ava	536	’ I ignore him and keep going . The anger bubbling inside me has shocked me as much as it ’s shocked Jesse . This is past controlling . This is unforgivable . I do n’t want a baby . ‘
34857	34907	34852	34852	I	2813	’ His heavy footsteps are close behind me , but he ’s nude , and as much as I know that he has no shame , I know he would n’t run out in public completely naked . When I reach the door , I turn to face him . ‘

34921	34949	34917	34917	You	536	’ His terrified face nearly makes me throw my arms around his big shoulders . Even now , when he ’s confessed to sealing my pills , I ’m
34968	35026	34967	34967	I	2813	’m setting myself up for a lifetime of manipulating . I ca n’t do that . We need some time apart . This is too intense , and perhaps I should have thought about that before I married him , but it ’s too late now . I might have made the biggest mistake of my life . ‘
35035	35148	35028	35028	you	536	’ I walk out . Chapter 7 Kate ’s not at home , so I let myself in and make my way upstairs to my old room . After sitting on the bed for an eternity and ignoring Massive Attack ’s Angel , I finally drag myself up and have a long shower . Under the hot spray , I soap everywhere , running the sponge absentmindedly all over my body and pausing when I reach my stomach . I feel devoid of any emotion . There are no natural motherly instincts in me that make me want to caress my tummy . I ’ve never given motherhood a second thought . I ’m
35324	35424	35323	35323	I	2813	’m surprised , but then it vibrates in my hand . It ’s a text message . I ca n’t be without you Ava . I sigh midland shake my head , but I do n’t reply because I really do n’t know what to say . I do n’t bother drying my hair or putting on lotion . I throw on a baggy t - shirt and some sweatpants , and crawl into the cold sheets of my old bed . It ’s hard , it ’s lumpy and it has n’t got Jesse in it , but I ’m
35494	35501	35502	35502	Kate	2774	‘ I said it ’s over ! ’
35505	35512	35502	35502	Kate	2774	‘ This is n’t going anywhere ! ’
35552	35592	35593	35593	Kate	2774	’m going to see will be Dan . But it ’s not . It ’s Sam . My already aching heart takes a further nosedive for my troubled best friend . She does n’t know what she ’s doing . ‘
35598	35706	35593	35593	Kate	2774	’ Sam ’s voice is beseeching , and a little confused , which tells me he has no idea why Kate is finishing their relationship . Relationship seems like a pretty strange word to use to describe their set - up , but past all of the jokes and casualness , is a connection I ’ve never witnessed with Kate and a man . Not even with my brother . If they could get past all things Manor - ish , then I know they would be perfect for each other . I could kill my brother . And I could kill Kate for being so stupid . ‘
35712	35745	35710	35710	Sam	2844	’ She stomps off across the landing , straight into the kitchen where she ’s obviously opening and slamming every cupboard door in sight . Then I see Sam follow her in . ‘
35753	35757	35710	35710	Sam	2844	’ he asks , ‘
35762	35763	35710	35710	Sam	2844	’ ‘
35766	35859	35710	35710	Sam	2844	’ There ’s a collection of further bangs before she ’s coming back out of the kitchen and marching into the lounge . I catch a glimpse of her pale face , looking no brighter than this morning . Her red hair is still dull and scrapped into a ponytail . I know that expression . That ’s her stubborn , I’m - not - being - honest face . I could throttle the stupid cow . Now I want Sam to leave so I can let loose on my wilful friend . ‘
35864	35900	35710	35710	Sam	2844	’ Sam almost laughs , but it ’s a nervous laugh . It ’s a laugh that clearly indicates worry . This just confirms my thoughts . Sam really does like Kate . A lot . ‘
35904	35909	35710	35710	Sam	2844	’ she spits shortly . ‘
35924	35952	35914	35914	you	649	’ I ca n’t see them , so I creep out quietly , scolding myself for being so nosey , but I need to hear this because I ’m
35973	35982	35983	35983	He	2844	‘ I do n’t owe you an explanation . ’
35989	35997	35983	35983	He	2844	‘ Yes , I think you do ! ’
36020	36043	36012	36014	the stubborn cow	650	‘ No , I do n’t . We were fucking , nothing more . It was fun while it lasted , but I ’m
36047	36083	36012	36014	the stubborn cow	650	’ Her cold words slice through me , so I can only imagine what they ’ve done to Sam . He does n’t say anything , but I see the slight shake of his head . ‘
36086	36090	36012	36014	the stubborn cow	650	’ he repeats . ‘

36110	36117	36109	36109	I	2813	’m going to have with you . ’
36236	36312	36235	36235	I	2813	’m infuriated with her , but feeling incredibly sorry for my stupid best friend . What is she trying to prove here ? I ca n’t help but think that this would never have happened if Dan was n’t here . I could stay in my room and let her have her tears , but instead of letting Kate grieve in peace , I step out and walk across the landing to the lounge . I ’m
36343	36443	36342	36342	I	2813	’m not letting her evade me this time . I lean up against the doorframe of the lounge and watch for an eternity as her shoulders jerk and she cries relentlessly . My instincts tell me to sit beside her and cuddle her , but I do n’t , and after a good ten minutes , she harshly brushes her cheeks and stands , turning and immediately clocking me in the doorway . As I knew she would , she plasters on an unaffected face and tries to smile . It ’s insulting to my intelligence and our friendship . ‘

36698	36717	36697	36697	I	2813	’m not caving in . She will not brush me off this time . She laughs a little . ‘
36723	36760	36697	36697	I	2813	’ Her smile falters when she realises what she ’s just said . She ’s invited me to get it off my chest , and by the look on her face , she ’s regretting it . ‘

36854	36868	36853	36853	We	656	’re supposed to be friends . We ’ve always told each other everything . ’

36934	36992	36933	36933	I	2813	’m so relieved . I was on the cusp on slapping her for being so tenacious , but now my arm is around her and she ’s sobbing into my chest . I do n’t know about Kate , but I feel so much better for this . She does care . I try to soothe her . ‘

They had no respect for each other — not mentally or physically . It was all just about the sex . Mind - blowing sex does not make up for the relationship ’s other failings , which in Dan and Kate ’s case was on every other level . At the time , I ignored it all , simply because the thought of my best friend and my brother being in love was so ideal . That was the problem , though . They were n’t in love . It was just lust , and maturity has made that glaringly obvious to me . She shifts in my embrace and sits herself up , taking a few calming breaths . ‘

38374	38455	38371	38371	I	2813	‘ Yeah , okay , understatement of the fucking century , but his way with you has always been so endearing to me . How much he loves you , frets , and protects you . We all know his behaviour is way past unreasonable , but it ’s common knowledge that he ’s never cared before . But stealing your pills ? I did n’t think that man could shock me , but he ’s outdone himself this time . ’
38456	38460	38461	38461	I	2813	‘ He has , ’

38576	38616	38505	38505	Kate	2774	’ Kate ’s chair scrapes across the kitchen floor and the next thing I know , she ’s standing behind me with her arms wrapped around my shoulders . She actually hushes me quietly in my ear , like I ’m

38800	38852	38796	38796	I	2813	’ she says . I ca n’t believe how relieved I am to hear her say that . I know she ’s very fond of Jesse , and generally nothing fazes her , not even my husband in all of his challenging ways , but this has shocked her , and I ’m

38868	38873	38865	38865	she	674	‘ Make him sweat ? ’
38874	38879	38880	38880	Kate	2774	‘ Have an abortion . ’
38892	38922	38923	38923	She	674	‘ Kate , can you imagine what he ’ll be like ? He already smothers me , and I like it to a certain extent , but being pregnant ? ’
38929	38944	38923	38923	She	674	‘ Oh God , Ava . You ’ll send him to the loony bin . ’
38945	38954	38955	38955	I	2813	‘ That ’s not a good enough reason . ’
38984	39003	38983	38983	I	2813	’m not ready for this , and he has n’t stopped once to consider how I might feel . ‘
39018	39033	39017	39017	I	2813	’m twenty six years old . I do n’t want a baby , Kate . ’

39045	39049	39017	39017	I	2813	‘ Just say I ’m

39072	39136	39017	39017	I	2813	’ she says reluctantly . She does n’t think it ’s okay at all , but her willingness to halt any guilt trip is enough for me . I feel guilty enough already , although I should n’t . I need to regain control , and I ca n’t see any other way of doing it . I ca n’t have a baby . ‘
39140	39174	39017	39017	I	2813	’ I whisper , picking up my tea and taking a shaky sip . Chapter 8 It ’s Monday . I wake at the crack of dawn and cry silently to myself . I ’m

39419	39422	39411	39411	He	374	‘ Perfect . ’
39442	39474	39441	39441	I	2813	’m really feeling . I could ’ve said good , or fine , or great , but no … I say perfect . Perfectly distraught , that ’s what I am . ‘

39527	39549	39550	39550	He	374	‘ Sal ’s in the stationary cupboard having a tidy up , and Tom and Victoria should be here by now . ’
39556	39561	39562	39562	he	374	‘ Van Der Haus , ’
39585	39593	39570	39570	I	2813	‘ Has he been in touch yet ? ’
39594	39597	39598	39598	I	2813	‘ No , ’
39655	39668	39669	39669	He	306	’m thinking my Lord will not be pressing me on this issue . ‘

39689	39713	39669	39669	He	306	’ Patrick shifts on my desk . I will him to at least be still if he insists on torturing the poor thing . ‘
39732	39744	39729	39730	Mr Ward	306	’ He chuckles at his own little joke , and although I ’m
39753	39779	39752	39752	I	2813	’m grateful for Patrick ’s acceptance of mine and Jesse ’s relationship . If there will even be a relationship after the next few days . ‘
39823	39827	39828	39828	Ava	536	’ Patrick laughs . ‘

39847	39867	39845	39845	Habit	106	’ I grumble . I could think of a lot of words I could call him at the moment . ‘
39876	39877	39868	39868	You	536	’ ‘
39880	39895	39868	39868	You	536	’ I pull out the design from my drawer and present it to Patrick . ‘
39898	39903	39868	39868	You	536	’ he says simply , ‘
39912	39957	39958	39958	He	306	’ Stunning ? Yes . Expensive ? Ridiculously . But Patrick does n’t realise the benefits of these beds in a place like The Manor . To my big cuddly bear of a boss , The Manor is still just a lovely country retreat . ‘
39963	39979	39958	39958	He	306	’ I shrug and take the design back when he hands it to me . I ’m
40043	40060	40042	40042	I	2813	’m eternally grateful that my legs were n’t tucked under it . They ’d be broken . ‘
40064	40185	40186	40186	I	2813	’ Patrick shouts , rolling around among the many pieces of broken wood and stationary that graced my desk , including my flat computer screen . I do n’t know whether to jump up to help him or just laugh . A rip roaring giggle is bubbling in my throat , and it ’s taking every modicum of power to hold it back . This is just too funny . I lose the battle . A burst of laughter flies from my mouth . There is not a chance on earth Patrick is getting up from the floor without any help , but I doubt I ’ll be of any assistance . He must weigh six times more than me . ‘
40187	40190	40191	40191	I	2813	’m sorry ! ’
40203	40206	40191	40191	I	2813	‘ Here , ’

40278	40282	40283	40283	I	2813	‘ Oh God ! ’
40296	40303	40283	40283	I	2813	‘ Patrick , are you okay ? ’
40323	40327	40309	40309	He	2813	‘ No , I ’m
40340	40347	40348	40348	I	2813	’ He tugs at my hand . ‘
40349	40352	40348	40348	I	2813	’m sorry ! ’
40359	40409	40358	40358	I	2813	’m crying , mascara probably pouring down my cheeks . I throw all of my strength into heaving Patrick up from the floor , making quick work so I can get to the toilet . And I do just that when I ’ve finally got him to his feet . ‘
40413	40471	40358	40358	I	2813	’ I laugh , running towards the ladies , passing a shocked looking Sal as I fly past the stationary cupboard . When I ’ve sorted myself out and composed my jerking body , I walk back into the office to find Tom and Victoria have arrived and Sal on her knees collecting up a million paperclips . ‘
40475	40479	40358	40358	I	2813	’ Victoria whispers . ‘
40486	40512	40358	40358	I	2813	’ I smile , and try my hardest to keep the giggling fit from returning again . If I start , I wo n’t stop . ‘
40517	40522	40513	40513	I	2813	’ Tom cries incredulously . ‘
40526	40540	40541	40541	Darling	61	’ He hangs his man - bag on the back of his chair . ‘

40586	40623	40628	40628	Ava	536	’ I dart warning eyes to my ditsy work colleague , and she acknowledges her near error by snapping her mouth shut and hastily removing herself from the area . I kneel down to help Sal . ‘
40630	40635	40636	40636	You	536	’ she muses dreamily . ‘
40637	40641	40642	40642	Sal	60	’re so lucky . ’
40683	40794	40682	40682	I	2813	’m a little surprised that it ’s taken him until now to call me , and even more surprised he was n’t so persistent last night . These signs are all an indication of one thing and one thing alone . He knows he ’s pushed the boundaries . I ca n’t even imagine what he ’s doing with himself , besides running continuous laps of the Royal Parks . Sal looks at me expectantly , but I just smile and continue picking up paperclips and popping them in a pot . It ’s only now I wonder why out of all the things we could be clearing up , we ’re
40802	40809	40810	40810	I	2813	‘ I ’ll call him back . ’
40825	40878	40883	40883	Patrick	374	’re done , Sal gets up and heads to the kitchen to make coffee , while I pull myself up and head for Patrick ’s office . I knock the door and poke my head around . He ’s sitting at his desk , a little red faced , combing his hair . ‘
40885	40905	40883	40883	Patrick	374	’ I ask , biting my lip furiously as I take in his buttoned jacked concealing his rounded belly . ‘
40911	40914	40915	40915	he	374	’m fine . ’
40933	40948	40949	40949	He	374	‘ I think Irene might see this as a sign to lose some weight . ’
40971	40973	40966	40966	I	2813	‘ I ’m
40983	40984	40985	40985	I	2813	’ ‘
40986	41002	40985	40985	I	2813	’m sorry , but you must have heard the creaks every time you sat there . ’
41003	41013	40985	40985	I	2813	‘ Yes , I did . Stupid cheap tat ! ’
41014	41016	40985	40985	I	2813	‘ I ’m
41019	41035	40985	40985	I	2813	’ I agree on a serious face . There was nothing cheap about my desk . ‘
41042	41043	41037	41037	you	374	’ ‘
41046	41050	41037	41037	you	374	’ he grumbles . ‘
41059	41060	41037	41037	you	374	’ ‘
41063	41106	41108	41108	he	696	’ I slip out of his office and return to my pile of wood , rummaging around the lose parts until I find my bag . I locate my phone , clear the missed call from Jesse , then dial my doctor . ‘
41111	41122	41123	41123	He	696	’ Tom asks on a chuckle , Victoria joining him . ‘
41145	41149	41150	41150	He	696	’ I grin . ‘
41155	41175	41150	41150	He	696	’ Victoria laughs , flopping back in her chair . Tom looks over at Victoria and joins her laughter . ‘
41196	41287	41150	41150	He	696	’ I manage to hold my giggles and slip into the stationary cupboard when my call connects . After getting past the guard dog of a receptionist , I finally get an appointment for four o’clock . The day passes quite swiftly , with only a few missed calls from my Lord . The calls were expected , but what was n’t expected was his lack of persistence . He did n’t call the office , he did n’t stop by and he did n’t ring off the hook . I ’m
41393	41441	41442	41442	I	2813	’m determined to hold my own , and it ’s usually with his touch , so yes , distance if key . I collect by bag and get up from my makeshift desk , which happens to me a paste table we had stored out the back . ‘
41443	41450	41451	41451	I	2813	’m off . See you tomorrow . ’
41462	41470	41451	41451	I	2813	‘ I ’ve cleared it with Patrick . ’
41480	41525	41479	41479	I	2813	’m going because it will undoubtedly lead to further questions . Privacy in this office is a luxury . A chorus of goodbyes ring out as I shut the door behind me and make my way to the tube . Angel starts up as I ’m
41541	41645	41540	41540	I	2813	’m going , I really do n’t need to be thinking about him , but it ’s hard when his favorite track , is echoing very loudly , even from the depths of my bag . It stops for a nanosecond , but then starts again . I ignore it , focusing my attention on the nearing station . I jump on a shocked gasp when a tall , lean , green eyed wall lands in front of me , and my hand flies up to my chest , resting on my heart as I breathe heavily . Then I get mighty irritated . ‘
41651	41656	41657	41657	You	701	’ I ask shortly . ‘
41664	41671	41657	41657	You	701	’ He points to my bag . ‘
41679	41700	41657	41657	You	701	’ I look up at him and find an accusing stare . He knows damn well I could hear it . ‘
41706	41714	41657	41657	You	701	’ I can be accusing , too . ‘
41720	41747	41748	41749	A client	702	’ He steps in closer , but I move back . I ca n’t let him touch me . And shit , where am I going ? ‘
41751	41755	41756	41756	I	2813	’ I blurt . ‘
41761	41762	41763	41763	I	2813	’ ‘
41773	41775	41771	41771	Jesse	306	’ I ’m
41794	41820	41793	41793	I	2813	’m not concerned and neither is Jesse . He ’s just staring at me , looking shockingly spectacular in a grey suit and blue shirt . ‘
41841	41902	41903	41903	I	2813	’ He reaches forward and grasps my upper arm before sliding his touch down my arm until he ’s holding my hand . As always , my hairs stand up on end and a shiver reverberates through me . I watch him just stare at our joined hands , his fingers weaving through mine slowly as he chews his lip . ‘
41904	41909	41910	41910	He	2813	’m struggling , Ava . ’
41924	41929	41910	41910	He	2813	‘ Without you , I ’m
41933	42017	42018	42018	I	2813	’ My heart breaks for this man standing before me , and I clench my eyes shut , desperately fighting my natural instinct to step into him and hold him . If he ’s not getting his way with fuckings of various degrees or a Jesse style countdown , then he ’s breaking me down with heart wrenching words . It would n’t be so bad , but I know he absolutely means each and every syllable . He ’s crippling me again . ‘
42024	42053	42018	42018	I	2813	’ I hate myself for leaving him like this . I go to turn , fully expecting to be held back , but he releases my hand and I ’m
42063	42080	42081	42081	His	705	‘ Baby , please . I ’ll do anything . Please , do n’t leave me . ’
42097	42104	42096	42096	I	2813	’m still so mad with him . ‘
42129	42133	42128	42128	I	2813	’m asking for . ’
42134	42143	42144	42144	I	2813	‘ It ’ll be quicker on the tube . ’
42158	42166	42152	42152	I	2813	‘ But I want to take you . ’
42167	42178	42179	42179	I	2813	‘ We wo n’t make it in time with the … ’
42217	42272	42216	42216	I	2813	’m going . He ’ll have a seizure . I quickly wrack my tired brain and come up with only one option . I ’ll ask him to drop me off around the corner from the doctor . There are some residential properties close by . He wo n’t know any different . I sigh ‘
42278	42297	42302	42302	me	2813	’ The relief that washes over his face is obvious , and it emphasises my guilt . Why I ’m
42395	42401	42402	42402	he	712	‘ Where am I going ? ’
42447	42453	42454	42454	I	2813	‘ Luxemburg Gardens . Hammersmith . ’
42463	42466	42467	42467	he	712	‘ Okay , ’
42513	42557	42512	42512	I	2813	’m not surrendering on this . I just need to get myself to the doctor , minus one Jesse , and get my awful situation remedied . * * * He pulls into Luxemburg Gardens and drives slowly down the tree lined street . ‘
42562	42584	42512	42512	I	2813	’ I indicate to the left , and he pulls over . Now I pray that he does n’t hang about . ‘
42588	42594	42595	42595	You	712	’ I open the door . ‘
42596	42599	42600	42600	he	712	’re welcome . ’
42648	42657	42658	42658	he	712	‘ Will you have dinner with me tonight ? ’
42682	42701	42670	42670	I	2813	‘ You just asked for ten minutes , and I gave them to you . You said nothing . ’
42861	42866	42860	42860	I	2813	’m not sure how I ’m
42895	42911	42894	42894	I	2813	’m facing a grilling and an even sterner talk on carelessness . She ’ll think I ’m
42948	43000	42947	42947	I	2813	’m fidgeting and pulling at my clothes to try and cool myself down . I really do feel sick , my nauseous state only worsened when , like an omen , I come across an article expressing the arguments for and against termination . A despairing laugh falls from my lips . ‘
43004	43027	43028	43028	You	222	’ I freeze in my waiting room chair as Jesses familiar brogue washes over me , then I snap the magazine shut . ‘
43032	43045	43046	43046	You	222	’ I ask , completely stunned as I turn to face him . ‘
43047	43054	43055	43055	he	222	’re a rubbish liar , baby . ’
43067	43081	43066	43066	I	2813	’m shit at it , but I need to work on it if I ’m
43091	43103	43090	43090	I	2813	’m going to stay ? Did I really just think that ? ‘
43112	43125	43126	43126	He	222	’re at the doctors and why you lied to me about it ? ’
43160	43167	43168	43168	I	2813	‘ Just a check - up . ’
43182	43188	43189	43189	His	222	‘ A check - up ? ’
43224	43227	43218	43218	He	222	‘ Yes , ’
43228	43240	43241	43241	he	222	‘ Do n’t you think we should we doing this together ? ’
43289	43309	43283	43283	I	2813	‘ Like the decision you made to try and get me knocked up ? Did we do that together ? ’
43310	43313	43314	43314	he	222	‘ No , ’
43363	43389	43393	43393	Jesse	306	‘ You ca n’t even look at me , can you ? You know what you ’ve done is wrong . I pray to God I ’m
43416	43443	43446	43446	you	725	’ It ’s him who looks shocked now . His eyes are narrowed , his hair starting to dampen at his temples from a stressed sweat . ‘
43447	43458	43444	43444	I	2813	’re pregnant , and I know how it ’ll be . ’
43459	43462	43463	43463	I	2813	‘ Oh ? ’
43471	43478	43479	43479	His	2813	‘ How ’s that , then ? ’
43521	43524	43525	43525	he	2813	‘ Perfect . ’
43545	43563	43544	43544	I	2813	’m snapped from the spell that he places me under when my name is called , and I ’m
43600	43772	43775	43775	you	729	’m not setting myself up for that . I stand up , causing his hand to fall from my knee and his other from my face , but to my utter shock , Jesse quickly rises , too . Oh no ! He is not coming in with me . This is going to be mortifying enough , without my neurotic Lord adding to the messy equation . Doctor Monroe will likely have something to say about me requesting an abortion , and that ’s without the added knowledge of me being married . It would take far too much explaining . I do n’t want to explain . Anyway , if I am pregnant , I need Jesse not to know . He would never let me terminate his baby , and I hate to think of what lengths he ’d go to in order to stop me . I can control my poor lying for something this important . I have no choice . It ’s the only way . ‘
43778	43786	43775	43775	you	729	’ I grate , and he recoils . ‘
43789	43880	43881	43881	Ava	536	’ I point to the chair and flash him the most threatening face I can muster . It ’s hard . I could vomit at any moment . I feel terrible , and really really hot . Much to my utter shock , he wisely lowers himself back down to the chair gingerly , his expression truly dazed by my outburst . I turn and leave him looking like he ’s been slapped in the face , and take a deep , encouraging breath before entering my doctor ’s office . ‘
43888	43951	43955	43955	Doctor	730	’ Doctor Monroe is probably one of the nicest women I have ever met — early fifties , a little bit of middle age spread and a sharp blonde bob . She has all the time in the world for you … normally . She was n’t so pleased when I presented myself for the third time to replace my lost pills . ‘
43957	43977	43955	43955	Doctor	730	’ I reply nervously , as I perch myself on the end of a chair . She looks concerned . ‘
43988	43989	43982	43982	You	729	’ ‘
43991	44007	44008	44008	I	2813	’m fine , I just feel a bit icky . It ’s probably the heat . ’
44020	44025	44026	44026	she	729	‘ Are you sure ? ’
44051	44053	44032	44032	I	2813	‘ I ’m
44056	44060	44061	44061	I	2813	’ I blurt . ‘
44095	44099	44100	44100	Her	729	’m a fool . ’
44107	44112	44113	44113	She	729	‘ Oh , Ava . ’
44142	44145	44146	44146	She	729	‘ Here . ’
44159	44166	44153	44153	I	2813	‘ When was your period due ? ’
44167	44170	44171	44171	I	2813	‘ Today . ’
44179	44183	44184	44184	she	729	‘ Only today ? ’
44190	44215	44187	44187	I	2813	‘ Ava , what makes you so certain . Your period can be a few days late , just as it can be early . ’
44216	44223	44224	44224	I	2813	‘ Trust me , I know . ’
44228	44236	44227	44227	I	2813	’m no longer in denial , and I ’m
44259	44266	44267	44267	she	729	‘ Take this to the toilet . ’
44370	44435	44369	44369	I	2813	’m back with my Doctor and staring at the test , which is neatly positioned at the other end of her desk . She taps away on her keyboard while I frantically tap my foot on the floor . I hold my breath when she reaches over and picks the test up , looking down at it briefly before turning her eyes on me . ‘
44438	44497	44498	44498	I	2813	’ she says simply , holding it up for me to see myself . I knew it would be , but the confirmation makes it even more of a reality , and it also enflames the hurt and madness that has brought me to this point in my life . I ca n’t seem to cry , though . ‘
44503	44516	44498	44498	I	2813	’ I say clearly , looking straight into Doctor Monroe ’s eyes . ‘
44524	44535	44536	44536	Ava	536	’ I watch as she visibly sags in her chair . ‘
44557	44558	44536	44536	Ava	536	’ ‘
44562	44563	44536	44536	Ava	536	’ ‘
44588	44597	44598	44598	I	2813	’m certain you ’ll be well looked after . ’
44601	44607	44608	44608	I	2813	‘ I want a termination . ’
44642	44646	44641	44641	I	2813	’m not . I ’m
44649	44652	44653	44653	she	739	‘ Right , ’
44656	44672	44673	44673	She	739	‘ Okay , you ’ll need a scan to determine how far gone you are . ’
44691	44693	44684	44684	I	2813	‘ I ’m
44730	44731	44733	44733	you	741	’ ‘
44735	44759	44733	44733	you	741	’ I murmur , taking the prescription from her . She does n’t release it immediately , and I look up at her . ‘
44768	44796	44766	44766	Ava	536	’ She looks at me questioningly , obviously doubting my decision , so I offer a small smile to reinforce that I really am fine , that I ’m
44802	44806	44807	44807	I	2813	‘ Thank you , ’
44821	44827	44812	44812	I	2813	‘ Take care , Ava . ’
44849	44857	44858	44858	He	744	‘ Ava ! What ’s the matter ? ’
44887	44892	44873	44873	He	744	‘ Jesus , Ava . ’
44911	44986	44987	44987	I	2813	’m going to throw up . I dart across the corridor and crash into the ladies , then proceed to eject the contents of my stomach in the first toilet I find . I brace my hands on the seat and ignore the compulsion to wash my hands immediately . Jesse ’s big , warm palm is gently circling my back as I heave , and he pulls my hair out of the way . ‘
44988	44991	44987	44987	I	2813	’m fi … ’
45048	45059	45039	45039	I	2813	‘ Oh dear , should I get you some water ? ’
45086	45089	45090	45090	Jesse	306	‘ Please . ’
45111	45116	45117	45117	he	306	‘ Are you done ? ’
45121	45127	45117	45117	he	306	‘ I do n’t know . ’
45133	45146	45128	45128	I	2813	‘ It ’s okay , we can stay . Are you okay ? ’

45152	45178	45117	45117	he	306	’ I say haughtily . He does n’t say anything . He takes the water from Doctor Monroe when she returns and assures her that I ’m

45251	45277	45242	45242	I	2813	’ I assure him as I wipe my mouth with tissue . I know there ’s no more to come up . I feel empty . ‘
45280	45296	45242	45242	I	2813	’ He pulls me to my feet and settle ’s my hair down my back . ‘
45304	45363	45242	45242	I	2813	’ I take the glass from him and walk over to the sinks to wash my hands . I sip , swill and spit to clean my mouth out , and as I look up into the mirror , I see Jesse standing behind me . He looks worried . I brush my cheeks and ruffle my hair . ‘
45370	45380	45381	45381	Jesse	306	’ he says as he comes to stand closer . ‘
45384	45389	45390	45390	He	306	’m fine , really . ’
45402	45409	45390	45390	He	306	‘ Let me look after you . ’

45452	45467	45468	45468	You	754	’ I step back and pick my bag up from where I dumped it . ‘
45469	45475	45468	45468	You	754	’re not okay , Ava . ’
45476	45488	45489	45489	My	2813	‘ Something has n’t agreed with me , that ’s all . ’
45497	45505	45489	45489	My	2813	‘ For fuck sake , lady ! You ’re
45518	45521	45522	45522	He	306	’re fine ! ’

45546	45581	45530	45530	he	306	’ I blurt quickly , but then suddenly contemplate the horrific thought of him not wanting me if he thinks that . My heart constricts painfully in my chest . I feel sick again . ‘
45584	45622	45623	45623	I	2813	’ He ’s quickly facing me , his eyes shocked , his body twitching . He really does want this badly . I fight my natural reflex , trying desperately to keep my hands by my side . ‘

45723	45744	45745	45745	I	2813	’m confused , exhausted and utterly heartbroken . No baby equals no Jesse . It ’s all very clear now . ‘
45746	45753	45745	45745	I	2813	’m not happy about this . I ’m
45766	45804	45745	45745	I	2813	’ He takes my hand , but I pull it away , bristling immediately at his comment . He ’s not happy ? He wants to keep an eye on me ? What , to check if I ’m

45815	45824	45825	45825	I	2813	’ I look him square in the eyes . ‘
45826	45849	45825	45825	I	2813	’m always doing something to upset you . Have you thought that perhaps you would be less not happy without me around ? ’
45850	45853	45854	45854	He	2813	‘ No ! ’

46047	46054	45987	45987	he	306	’ I hiss in his face . ‘
46060	46071	46059	46059	I	2813	’m not pregnant , I want to stay that way . ’
46081	46121	46122	46122	You	763	’m battling consuming guilt at his reaction to my news , but I have to ignore it . Sidestepping him , I start walking away , my legs a little shaky , my heart pounding relentlessly in my chest . ‘
46123	46131	46132	46132	he	306	’re not coming home , are you ? ’
46152	46312	46151	46151	I	2813	’m not going home , but the plan was for just five days so I can avoid being caught lying to him , then worry about the hospital when I get an appointment . But his words carry an air of finality , and more worryingly , he ’s not demanding that I stay with him . If I remove this baby from my life , it ’s becoming quite obvious that I ’ll be removing Jesse , too . That thought alone has my emotions taking hold . A life without Jesse ? I walk against the breeze , my face wet with tears . Chapter 9 The empty feeling was inevitable . The hollow , desolate , miserable feeling was inevitable . But the overwhelming guilt that has swamped me was not so expected . I fought off twinges here and there , when he was in front of me , looking so defeated , but now I ’m
46319	46394	46318	46318	I	2813	’m furious for feeling like this . The lack of urgency to chase my scan appointment is also screwing with my mind . It ’s Friday . It ’s day number four without Jesse . My week has been a steady torture , and I know it ’s never going to get better . My heart is slowly splitting , each day widening the crack until I know I ’ll probably cease functioning . I ’m
46465	46482	46483	46483	Sally	60	‘ Ava , you really should go home . You ’ve not been right all week . ’
46515	46521	46522	46522	I	2813	‘ Stupid bug hanging around . ’
46578	46587	46588	46588	I	2813	‘ Are you still seeing that internet bloke ? ’
46609	46612	46613	46613	She	60	‘ Mick ? ’
46616	46622	46613	46613	She	60	‘ Yes , I am . ’
46623	46630	46631	46631	I	2813	‘ And it ’s going well ? ’
46656	46659	46660	46660	she	60	‘ Yes ! ’
46667	46675	46676	46676	I	2813	‘ He really is perfect , Ava . ’
46679	46685	46676	46676	I	2813	‘ What does he do ? ’
46686	46701	46702	46702	I	2813	‘ Oh , some sort professional nonsense . I do n’t pretend to understand . ’
46705	46708	46709	46709	I	2813	‘ Good . ’
46749	46755	46739	46739	I	2813	‘ Excuse me , Sal . ’
46789	46829	46832	46832	Ruth	87	’m not hearing Angel , but I ca n’t ignore my exasperation when I see the caller is Ruth Quinn , my tiresome but infectiously enthusiastic client , whom I have spent way too much time on this week . ‘
46834	46835	46836	46836	Ava	536	’ ‘
46843	46855	46856	46856	I	2813	’ I know , and I probably look terrible , too . ‘
46857	46864	46856	46856	I	2813	’m feeling much better , Ruth . ’
46876	46886	46887	46887	She	87	‘ Oh good . Can we arrange a meeting ? ’
46898	46904	46905	46905	I	2813	‘ Is there a problem ? ’
46916	46947	46915	46915	I	2813	’m trying to keep this project as smooth as possible because even though Ruth seems pleasant enough , I predict a tricky customer if things do n’t go her way . ‘

46970	46974	46951	46951	I	2813	’ I prompt . ‘
46982	47037	46975	46975	I	2813	’ she informs me . I sag in my chair . Of course she would . She always prefers to see me . Her final invoice is going to be astronomical . One hour here and two hours there . She ’ll have spent more money on my time than on the actual works . ‘
47040	47140	47141	47141	Ruth	87	’ she adds . I sag further on an audible groan . I am not ending my shitty week with Ruth Quinn . I practically started it with Ruth on Tuesday , and I ’ve had a mid - week interlude on Wednesday . Anyway , it ’s three in the afternoon . Does she think she ’s my only client ? I would n’t mind , but she spends ten minutes clarifying what has already been clarified , then the next hour feeding me endless cups of tea and trying to convince me to join her for drinks . ‘
47150	47151	47141	47141	Ruth	87	’ ‘
47156	47161	47152	47152	You	87	’ She sounds irritated . ‘
47164	47183	47152	47152	You	87	’ Why did I say that ? I ’ll be starting my week off with Ruth Quinn again . ‘

47235	47271	47198	47198	I	2813	’ I stop writing , suddenly feeling very uncomfortable . I do n’t have anything nice planned for the weekend , apart from nursing my breaking heart , but before I can really consider what I ’m

47291	47297	47298	47298	She	771	‘ Oh ? Me either . ’
47310	47316	47306	47306	I	2813	‘ We should do drinks ! ’
47344	47356	47337	47337	I	2813	‘ Actually , Ruth . I said nothing much , but I ’m
47374	47378	47337	47337	I	2813	’ She laughs . ‘
47389	47399	47400	47400	I	2813	’ I force myself to laugh along with her . ‘

47433	47555	47431	47431	Ruth	87	’ I hang up and glance at the clock . Another hour and I can escape . * * * I drag my exhausted body up the stairs to Kate ’s flat and head straight for the kitchen , opening the fridge and being immediately confronted with a bottle of wine . I just stare at it . I do n’t know how long for , but my eyes are fixed on the damn thing . It takes the sound of a very familiar voice to pull my eyes away , and I turn , seeing Kate , but hers was n’t the familiar voice that caught my attention . Dan walks in . They both look as guilty as sin . ‘
47561	47584	47431	47431	Ruth	87	’ I ask , slamming the fridge door . Kate flinches , but remains quiet . My brother does n’t , though . ‘
47590	47645	47431	47431	Ruth	87	’ he snipes , slipping his hand around Kate ’s waist from behind , and then kissing her cheek . This is the first time I ’ve seen or spoken to him since my wedding , and it ’s not playing out to be a happy reunion , either . He frowns at me . ‘
47661	47686	47658	47658	you	774	’ I freeze in position and flick wide eyes to Kate , catching her very faint head shake . She ’s not told him . ‘

47782	47857	47781	47781	I	2813	’m liking my brother less and less by the day . I never thought I ’d be glad to see the back of him . I ignore the exchange of goodbyes going on behind me and focus my attention on pouring a big glass of wine . By the time I ’ve sipped half , I hear footsteps going down the stairs , and I turn to face my stupid , red head friend . ‘
47863	47872	47859	47859	you	776	’ I wave my wine glass at her . ‘
47875	47891	47859	47859	you	776	’ she grumbles , sitting herself down on a chair and signalling for some wine . ‘

47901	47918	47859	47859	you	776	’ I grab another glass and pour some , passing it over the table to her . ‘

47985	47989	47984	47984	I	2813	’m clenching . I ’m

48016	48044	48015	48015	I	2813	’m trying to dampen down the burning guilt that ’s simmering in my gut . She gets up , climbs onto the worktop and lights a cigarette . ‘
48058	48074	48015	48015	I	2813	’ she says , opening the kitchen window and draping her arm over the ledge . ‘
48080	48091	48094	48094	you	776	’ I frown , and take a more reluctant sip . ‘

48135	48145	48134	48134	I	2813	’m more in denial now than I ever was . ‘

48301	48334	48338	48338	Ava	536	’ I shake my head , her further blasé words eating me up inside . She sighs and flicks her cigarette butt from the window before closing it and lowering herself down . ‘

48458	48490	48496	48496	him	783	’ She smiles and we leave the kitchen together to get ready for a quiet drink and a chat . * * * He ’s constantly on my mind , and I ’m
48555	48558	48559	48559	Kate	2774	‘ Wine ? ’
48570	48573	48563	48563	she	2774	‘ Please , ’
48601	48617	48600	48600	they	789	’re here . I tap Kate on the shoulder and she turns her head slightly . ‘
48626	48630	48600	48600	they	789	’ I ask . ‘
48633	48669	48670	48670	Barbie	116	’ I nod in the direction of my gay friend and sassy , sometimes a bit dim , work colleague who are dancing over . They have no idea what ’s happening in my life . ‘
48674	48692	48670	48670	Barbie	116	’ I quip dryly . I can tell by Kate ’s eye roll that she did n’t . ‘
48697	48721	48670	48670	Barbie	116	’ Tom croons , stroking my midriff . I look down at the tight , black jersey dress that I borrowed from Kate . ‘
48724	48736	48737	48737	You	791	’ I take the glass being handed over Kate ’s shoulder . ‘
48740	48756	48737	48737	You	791	’ I ask Victoria . She fluffs her hair and sweeps it over her shoulder . ‘
48759	48770	48737	48737	You	791	’ Oh ? Not good or great , but amazing ? ‘
48774	48790	48737	48737	You	791	’ I ask , wishing she could transfer some of that amazing over to me . ‘
48796	48800	48801	48801	She	791	’ She giggles . ‘
48807	48824	48801	48801	She	791	’ Tom nudges Victoria in the side , spiking a heavy scowl from the pretty blonde . ‘

48969	49022	48968	48968	I	2813	’m probably going to be dragged from the bar , but that does n’t stop my eyes from slowly dragging up his jean clad legs , onto his white shirt , up his neck and finally onto his face — the one that sends my eyes delirious with pleasure , even when I ’m
49149	49257	49148	49148	I	2813	’m crushed , my racing mind thinking up all sorts of explanations for his quiet absence over the last four days — where he ’s been , what he ’s been doing . He ’s clearly not mourning his loss . He looks arrogant , confident and sickeningly handsome — just like he did on the day I met him . They are all familiar traits to me , but right now , they are all enhanced . He knows the effect he ’s having on me and all of the other women dribbling at his heels . Uncertainty and raging jealously are strangling me , and I ’m
49363	49447	49362	49362	I	2813	’m aware of the silence in our group , so I drag my eyes away from my bastard of a husband and see Kate watching me closely , Tom dribbling along with the other hussies and Victoria scuffing her ridiculous heels on the bar floor in an awkward silence . I shake my head on a little laugh and take a massive swig of the wine I ’ve been carefully sipping , flicking my eyes briefly over in his direction . He knows I ’m
49459	49475	49458	49458	I	2813	’m willing , and I do n’t plan of settling for anything less than gold . ‘
49480	49546	49552	49552	Ava	536	’ I down the rest of my wine and slam the glass on the bar before pushing my way through the small crowds until I find myself on the dance floor . When I turn around , I find my three loyal friends have all joined me . Kate looks nervous . I make a snatch for her wine , but she swipes it away . ‘
49554	49559	49552	49552	Ava	536	’ she warns seriously . ‘
49563	49567	49568	49568	I	2813	’re still pregnant . ’
49569	49643	49568	49568	I	2813	’m trying to piece together something to strike back with , but nothing is coming to me , so in an act of complete stupidity , I turn and stomp over to the bar . I know he ’s watching me , and I know Kate is , too , but it does n’t stop me from ordering and then downing a fresh glass in one foul swoop before returning to the floor . ‘
49651	49657	49568	49568	I	2813	’ Kate yells at me . ‘
49664	49671	49663	49663	you	536	’re a fucking twat , then you ’re
49674	49698	49701	49704	my pissed off friend	802	’ Her words would probably hit a nerve if the alcohol was n’t getting in the way . I do n’t care . I ’m
49729	49750	49724	49724	He	803	‘ Get me a whistle , shove me in some hot pants and put me on that podium ! Ibiza ! ’
49794	49819	49793	49793	I	2813	’m in a world of my own . My only awareness is of the loud music and me at the centre of it . I ’m
49884	49930	49883	49883	I	2813	’m surrounded by him , and even though I should be pushing him away , I ca n’t . My blank mind remains blank , and I start moving with him as he kisses my neck , his hard cock pushing into my back . I ’m
50024	50050	50023	50023	I	2813	’m being dragged from the dance floor . I could try to stop him , but I do n’t . I follow his lead until I ’m
50134	50190	50133	50133	I	2813	’m pushed up against the wall by his body . The music is louder , and I look up , seeing integrated speakers in the ceiling , but my face is soon yanked back down . Our eyes meet . His greens are dark , completely smoked out and his lips are slightly parted . I ’m
50268	50352	50267	50267	I	2813	’m desperate for him , but the placing of my hands and his hard body compressed to mine is preventing me from moving anything but my head , so I reach forward with my lips , but he ducks my aim . This is going to be on his terms . His lips hover over mine , only millimetres from my reach . His hot , minty breath heats my face , but then he pulls away . He ’s teasing me . I ’m
50365	50379	50364	50364	I	2813	’m more than ready to blurt my answer . My husky voice breaks . ‘
50383	50385	50364	50364	I	2813	’ I ’m
50389	50482	50388	50388	I	2813	’m aware of it , but I do n’t care . I want and need him all over me . His face is completely impassive as he flexes his grip on my wrists and increases the pressure of his body against mine . He slowly moves his face forward , his green orbs penetrating me completely , and tickles my lips with his . I moan and try to capture them , but he pulls away again , still poker - faced , still completely controlled . Not me , though . I ’m
50490	50494	50495	50495	I	2813	‘ Kiss me , ’
50747	50756	50746	50746	I	2813	’m not putting the stoppers on this . I ’m
50795	50838	50794	50794	they	812	’re not . My feverish breaths are thick and piercing . Jesse ’s breathing , though , is slow , shallow and controlled . He is in complete control and calm in his tactics . He knows what he ’s doing . I ’m
50847	51025	50846	50846	I	2813	’m spun around and pushed back into the wall , my body crashing harshly against the tiles . I turn my face and rest my hot cheek on the coldness , and his knee comes up , separating my thighs . He takes my hands and places them , palms flat , against the shiny surface . He does n’t need to verbally tell me to keep them there . His firm placing and the slow removal of his grip tells me what ’s expected of me . That and his lips pushed to my ear . When his palms rest on the outside of my thighs and clench the hem of my dress , my breathing hitches further , and I begin to physically shake . He slowly pulls it up to my waist , and then I hear the fly of his jeans being pulled down . Impatient , I push my arse out invitingly , only to have his hand collide with my cheek , the instant sting on my bareness spiking a scream . ‘
51028	51038	51039	51039	Jesse	306	’ I pant , earning myself another swift slap . ‘
51041	51178	51039	51039	Jesse	306	’ I turn my face towards the wall , resting my forehead against the tiles , my scorching breath steaming up the black , shiny surface . How long is he going to do this ? How long will he make me suffer ? But then my hips are pulled back , my knickers yanked to the side and he slams into me . I yell at the shock , fast invasion , but he is silent , not even panting , not even shaking . He slowly pulls back , holding himself steady for a few moments , before he powers forward again . My stomach twists , my head is whirling and my forehead is rolling from side to side across the tiles . I do n’t know what to do with myself . I ’m
51315	51348	51314	51314	I	2813	’m yanked back to meet him over and over again , each forceful , punishing blow assisting me in achieving my main aim : ultimate detonation . And just when I think I ’m
51438	51619	51437	51437	I	2813	’m screaming before I ’ve even climaxed , but then the rush of pressure soars and flings me into an abyss of intoxicating pleasure and I shatter , screaming louder , and I know he ’s come too , even though he remains silent . My head drops , finding a sweat covered face , glazed greens and still a straight , unemotional , unaffected face . It completely baffles me . I shift my hands to his hair and pull him forward , but he resists , instead moving his hands to my legs and pushing them down from his body . I find my feet , keeping myself relatively stable by leaning against the wall while I watch him . He slides his hand into my knickers , collecting the wetness , and runs his palm all over my chest before he wipes his brow , re - fastens his trousers , turns and walks out . Chapter 10 I straighten myself out and do my best to compose my ruffled state . It ’s no good . I ’m
51670	51682	51669	51669	I	2813	’m some tart who he picked up in a bar . I ’m
51712	51718	51708	51708	Kate	2774	‘ There you are ! We ’re
51721	51722	51708	51708	Kate	2774	’ ‘
51725	51730	51731	51731	Sam	2844	’ She looks panicked . ‘

I glance through and see him standing at the bar , a glass of clear liquid in one hand , and in his other … a woman ’s arse . I see red . I yank my hand from Kate ’s and steam towards my fucked up , fucking twat of a husband . ‘
51865	51914	51858	51858	Ava	536	’ Kate calls . I ignore her and fight my way through the crowd . He looks up and clocks me , but his eyes do n’t widen , he does n’t look guilty or like he ’s been caught out . Why would he ? He knows I ’m

52608	52671	52607	52607	I	2813	’m just about to start begging when Jesse gets to his feet and drags the man up , pinning him against a pillar before bringing his knee up and striking with a full on , hard blow to the ribs . The man crumbles to the floor with his arms wrapped around his torso . I feel horrible , and not because I ’m
52712	52762	52708	52708	I	2813	’m shoved out the way and Jay charges through , doing a quick assessment of the situation before practically diving on Jesse and manhandling him out of the bar . I move back as they pass me , but Jesse fights against the skinhead and grabs hold of me . ‘
52769	52776	52708	52708	I	2813	’ he growls at me . I ’m

52850	52864	52865	52865	I	2813	’m abruptly lifted from my feet and secured against the doorman ’s chest . ‘
52881	52899	52865	52865	I	2813	’ he yells at Jesse . It works , but not before Jesse snarls at the doorman . ‘
52909	52941	52865	52865	I	2813	’ In my crazed state , I register exactly where Jay ’s hands are — one holding me around my waist and the other clenching my forearm . I defiantly wriggle . ‘

52962	52975	52976	52976	She	842	’ Jay asks as he paces out of the bar . What ? ‘
52982	53003	52976	52976	She	842	’ Jesse answers , flicking me a critical stare before re - focusing his attention forward and rubbing his jaw . ‘

53038	53064	53070	53070	you	845	’re both glowering at each other when everyone comes rushing out of the bar , including Dan . I do n’t need him seeing this . ‘
53072	53080	53083	53083	I	2813	’ Jesse roars . Dan steps forward . ‘

53888	53896	53897	53897	I	2813	’m tipsy , and he ’s determined . ‘
53904	53913	53914	53914	I	2813	’ I hear him snarl from behind me . ‘
53917	53924	53914	53914	I	2813	’ I counter , walking on . ‘

54057	54069	54054	54054	I	2813	’ He glares at me , and I glare right back . ‘
54082	54102	54054	54054	I	2813	’ I screech , and then tense , looking around to see who has heard my little outburst . I ’m
54151	54160	54135	54135	He	308	‘ You fucking asked for it , woman ! ’
54161	54166	54135	54135	He	308	‘ Me ? How ? ’
54167	54180	54181	54181	We	867	‘ You left me ! You promised you would never leave me ! ’
54223	54244	54222	54222	I	2813	’m not prepared to stand in the middle of the street all night , just to prove a point . I ’m
54252	54266	54267	54267	I	2813	‘ You should n’t have taken it upon yourself to decide my future . ’
54308	54310	54267	54267	I	2813	‘ You ’re
54318	54322	54324	54324	I	2813	’ he snaps . ‘
54331	54345	54346	54346	Jesse	306	’ He scoops me up from behind and carries me in his arms . ‘
54352	54368	54369	54369	I	2813	’ I complain weakly . My meagre attempt to wriggle free is really quite pathetic . ‘
54370	54378	54379	54379	I	2813	’m not putting you down , lady . ’
54453	54464	54452	54452	I	2813	’m aware of him getting in the car , and I ’m
54522	54526	54529	54529	Clive	90	‘ Oh dear ! ’
54549	54561	54534	54534	I	2813	‘ Should I get the elevator for you , Mr Ward ? ’
54562	54570	54571	54571	Jesse	306	‘ No , I ’ve got it . ’
54577	54583	54584	54584	he	306	‘ Fucking dress is ridiculous . ’
54633	54638	54639	54639	I	2813	‘ I can walk . ’
54681	54897	54680	54680	I	2813	’m the first to exit whilst fishing around in my clutch for my keys . I find them remarkably quickly , considering my disorientated hands , but getting the right one in the lock is another matter , entirely . I close one eye to try and focus as I slowly guide the key towards the lock . I hear him grumbling under his breath behind me , but I ignore him and carry on trying to insert the key . He must get fed up of waiting because there is suddenly a hand wrapped around my wrist , holding it steady and guiding it to the lock successfully . The door opens , I kick my shoes off and trample through the colossal open space , taking the stairs carefully . When I reach the top , I do n’t veer left to the master suite , instead taking a right and letting myself into my favourite spare room . I collapse in the bed fully dressed and without taking my make - up off , a clear indication of thorough exhaustion and drunkenness . I do n’t let it concern me for long , though . My eyes close of their own accord , and I feel myself slipping into a drunken slumber . ‘
54905	54917	54680	54680	I	2813	’ I feel my dress being peeled from my body . I ’m
54924	54938	54923	54923	I	2813	’m still slightly drunk and my eyes are semi stuck together with mascara . ‘
54948	54953	54923	54923	I	2813	’ I mumble irritably . ‘
54956	54976	54923	54923	I	2813	’ he says calmly , his strong , familiar arms wrapping around me and lifting me from the bed . ‘
54987	54991	54985	54985	lady	2813	’ he whispers , ‘
55005	55071	55072	55072	Ava	536	’ My arms automatically reach up and around him to hold on , and my face buries in his neck . I might be a little drunk and massively pissed off , but I recognise my favourite place . He lowers me to bed and a few moments later , he ’s laying the full length of my back and pulling me into his chest . ‘
55074	55081	55072	55072	Ava	536	’ he whispers in my ear . ‘
55084	55085	55072	55072	Ava	536	’ ‘
55093	55094	55091	55091	lady	536	’ ‘
55099	55111	55091	55091	lady	536	’ I mumble sleepily . I feel him squeeze me closer . ‘
55115	55119	55120	55120	I	2813	’ * * * ‘
55124	55139	55120	55120	I	2813	’ What is that ? I splutter and rip my mascara clogged eyes open . ‘
55142	55156	55120	55120	I	2813	’ he commands softly . I groan and roll over into my pillow . ‘
55161	55199	55120	55120	I	2813	’ I whine , hearing him chuckle . My head is banging . I ’ve not even lifted it off the pillow and it already feels like Black Sabbath are having their practice session in my skull . ‘
55205	55259	55120	55120	I	2813	’ He curls his forearm around my waist , and then drags me across the bed , onto his lap . I feel his palm smooth my hair and pull it from my face , and I peek through my eyes to see a glass of fizzing water being held to my lips . ‘
55262	55286	55120	55120	I	2813	’ he presses . I let him tip the glass to my mouth , and I sip the welcome cool , fizzing liquid . ‘
55291	55306	55120	55120	I	2813	’ I finish the whole glass and then collapse against his bare chest . I ’m
55312	55318	55319	55319	he	874	‘ How bad is it ? ’
55328	55331	55324	55324	he	874	‘ Bad . ’
55342	55487	55341	55341	I	2813	’m far too comfortable to open my mind to the events that have united me and this stonking hangover — united me with this maddening man . I feel him shift on the bed and then lean back , taking me with him . Well , at least he ’s talking to me enough to look after me in my pitiful state . What sort of person punishes the alcoholic love of her life by going out and getting drunk ? And when she ’s pregnant , not that he ’s aware . What sort of person torments her crazily possessive husband by shoving her tongue down another man ’s throat in front of him ? The same sort of person who hides the love of his life ’s pills to try and get her pregnant on the sly , that ’s who . We ’re
55493	55495	55341	55341	I	2813	‘ I ’m
55500	55510	55511	55511	Me	2813	’ I say quietly . He kisses my hair . ‘
55514	55566	55511	55511	Me	2813	’ He ’s brave . I must look and smell shocking . Hangover aroma ca n’t be the most pleasant wake up call , especially for a recovering alcoholic . I lay in a sorry heap across him , drifting in and out of sleep and in and out of thought . ‘
55572	55580	55581	55581	I	2813	’ he asks quietly , almost apprehensively . ‘
55582	55592	55593	55593	I	2813	’m thinking we ca n’t go on like this . ’
55597	55605	55606	55606	I	2813	‘ It ’s not good for you . ’
55623	55631	55620	55620	He	2813	‘ I do n’t care about me . ’
55632	55640	55641	55641	I	2813	‘ What are we going to do ? ’
55684	55700	55671	55671	He	2813	‘ I do n’t know , but I do know how much I love you . ’
55748	55755	55756	55756	I	2813	‘ Why did you do it ? ’
55771	55789	55770	55770	I	2813	’m referring to . He looks up at me , his frown line crawling across his forehead . ‘
55795	55800	55791	55791	I	2813	’ he says defensively . ‘
55808	55809	55791	55791	I	2813	’ ‘
55850	55851	55852	55852	I	2813	’ ‘
55860	55865	55852	55852	I	2813	’ he argues quietly . ‘
55871	55872	55875	55875	Jesse	306	’ ‘
55885	55900	55877	55877	You	2813	’ I shift slightly under him , and he looks up at me anxiously . ‘
55906	55989	55991	55991	my	2813	’ He searches my eyes but eventually rolls off to let me up . I drag myself from the bed and into the bathroom , closing the door behind me before brushing my teeth and getting in the shower . I feel completely deflated and just want to crawl back into bed and forget about everything , but my racing mind is venturing into frightening territory , making my head ache further . I ’ve not seen him for four days . I ’m
56034	56038	56039	56039	he	2813	‘ Let me . ’
56114	56122	56107	56107	he	2813	‘ Where have you been since Monday ? ’
56155	56159	56160	56160	he	2813	‘ In hell . ’
56164	56171	56172	56172	He	2813	‘ You left me , Ava . ’
56201	56206	56207	56207	I	2813	‘ Where were you ? ’
56228	56264	56265	56265	He	2813	‘ I was trying to give you space . I realise how I am with you , Ava , and I wish I could stop myself , I really do . But I ca n’t . ’
56278	56285	56272	56272	I	2813	‘ Where were you , Jesse ? ’
56286	56290	56291	56291	he	2813	‘ Following you . ’
56294	56297	56291	56291	he	2813	‘ Everywhere . ’
56298	56304	56305	56305	I	2813	‘ For four whole days ? ’
56320	56333	56308	56308	He	2813	‘ My only comfort was seeing how lost you were , too . ’
56349	56374	56375	56375	We	879	’m kneeling , too , mirroring him . He pushes my wet hair from my face and leans in to softly kiss my lips . ‘
56376	56384	56375	56375	We	879	’re not conventional , baby . But we ’re
56421	56422	56419	56419	Ava	536	’ ‘

56447	56471	56423	56423	We	879	’ He encourages me up onto his lap and links my arms around his neck before circling my waist with his big hands . ‘
56476	56481	56482	56482	He	536	’re supposed to be . ’
56493	56522	56482	56482	He	536	‘ Right here , always with me . Do n’t ever kiss another man again , Ava . They ’ll be locking me away for a long time . ’
56543	56553	56554	56554	My	2813	‘ You need to stop with the crazy shit . ’
56605	56609	56598	56598	he	536	’m doing as I ’m
56635	56674	56634	56634	I	2813	’m setting myself up for , but this side of him , the incredible loving affection , the doting side of him , almost supersedes all of his confusing , neurotic ways , which swiftly reminds me that I ’m
56682	56696	56679	56679	Jesse	306	’m not . He clenches my cheeks and pushes his lips to mine . ‘
56707	56715	56679	56679	Jesse	306	’ He ’s grinning around my lips . ‘
56718	56866	56679	56679	Jesse	306	’ I soak him right up , there in the soaking shower . Chapter 11 We spend most of Saturday making friends . I ’ve relished in the sleepy sex , and I ’ve disagreed with almost everything Jesse has said , just to get some sense fucked into me . I then swiftly forgot what I ’d agreed to during the sense fucking , instigating a reminder fuck . We had an alfresco fuck right after we ate on the terrace , followed by a retribution fuck when Jesse decided that breaking my promise warranted one . But I know he just wanted me in handcuffs and , quite frankly , I deserved it . I ’ve been fucked in every way , shape and form , and I ’ve loved every single second of it , even if I am a little sore now . I ’m
56940	56979	56934	56934	Kate	2774	’m sure I heard my brother in the background , but she denied it , proceeding to ask me if Jesse and I had made friends . Yes . She also asked if I ’d told Jesse that I ’m
57009	57017	57008	57008	I	2813	’m sure this is the right decision . ‘

I push myself up and crawl to the bottom of the bed , and then flop back down on my front , propping myself up on my elbows and resting my chin in my palm . I know what I ’m
57149	57153	57154	57154	My	2813	‘ I might . ’

57273	57284	57272	57272	I	2813	’m as soft as shit . But only for you . ’
57289	57298	57299	57299	I	2813	‘ You can be hard - hearted sometimes . ’
57318	57320	57324	57325	Mrs Ward	72	‘ You ’re
57327	57353	57324	57325	Mrs Ward	72	’ I watch his upside down body approach slowly until he ’s standing looking down at me , his steel shaft brushing my top lip . ‘
57358	57399	57324	57325	Mrs Ward	72	’ he asks , clasping the base and guiding himself from side to side across my lips . The hot dampness has my tongue darting out to taste , but he pulls back , his lips tipping at the corners . ‘
57403	57404	57324	57325	Mrs Ward	72	’ ‘
57407	57454	57455	57455	Ava	536	’ I reach up and run my fingertips down the centre of his chest , and he moans , guiding his cock straight to my lips . I open slowly while watching as his face contorts with anticipation , then I close my lips around him . ‘
57464	57473	57455	57455	Ava	536	’ he groans , clenching his eyes shut . ‘
57478	57492	57475	57475	I	2813	’ I bite down lightly and drag my teeth across his smooth flesh . ‘
57500	57501	57502	57502	I	2813	’ ‘
57515	57518	57519	57519	I	2813	’re doing . ’
57549	57556	57540	57540	I	2813	‘ Stop teasing me , lady . ’
57607	57611	57612	57612	he	536	‘ Oh fuck ! ’
57621	57626	57627	57627	He	536	‘ Just stay there . ’
57638	57816	57817	57817	I	2813	’m struggling to stop my stomach from convulsing . I keep quiet whilst he spasms against me , his head dropped back and his fists tightening in my hair . I need to keep control here . I can not be throwing up , I ’ll never explain it , so instead of concentrating on my mouthful of solid cock , I focus solely on keeping myself from retching . I close my eyes and inhale through my nose . What is wrong with me ? If pregnancy brings aversions and mine is a sudden intolerance of Jesse ’s manhood in my mouth , then I never want to be pregnant again . I relax a little when he withdraws and quickly drop him from my mouth before crawling up his body and wrapping my legs around him . I need to play this perfectly , especially judging by the incredulous look on his handsome face . He does n’t like me halting things . That ’s his call . I lean in and bite his lip . ‘
57823	57824	57825	57825	I	2813	’ ‘
57833	57844	57845	57845	I	2813	’ he splutters in disbelief . It makes me laugh . ‘
57846	57855	57845	57845	I	2813	’m glad you find it funny , Ava . ’
57856	57862	57845	57845	I	2813	‘ I do n’t , I ’m
57865	57884	57885	57885	I	2813	’ Pushing my lips to his , I wave the need card . It ’s my only option . ‘
57892	57920	57921	57921	You	888	’ He pulls back and narrows his eyes . It worries me . But then he knocks me out with his smile , reserved only for me . ‘
57932	57945	57930	57930	baby	306	’ He lowers me to the bed and comes down with me . ‘
57952	57969	57930	57930	baby	306	’ I yank the bath sheet from around his neck and fling it across the room . ‘
57977	57997	57930	57930	baby	306	’ he orders . I comply immediately , lacing my fingers though his mass of wet , dirty blonde . ‘
58001	58019	58024	58024	Ava	536	’ He leans down and licks my lips as I tug at his hair on a moan . ‘
58026	58045	58024	58024	Ava	536	’ His stern tone just spikes my need further . I tackle his mouth with desperation and conviction . ‘
58048	58065	58024	58024	Ava	536	’ he orders , and I do , even though I really do n’t want to . ‘
58070	58094	58024	58024	Ava	536	’ he whispers , and I sigh , gently sweeping my tongue through his mouth , so very lazily . It ’s heaven . ‘
58097	58119	58024	58024	Ava	536	’ he says harshly , and again I stop . He pulls back and drops a loving kiss on my lips . ‘
58131	58146	58024	58024	Ava	536	’ I grin and pull him in closer , re - claiming his mouth . ‘
58159	58167	58169	58169	his	536	’ He laughs and rolls over so I ’m
58172	58179	58169	58169	his	536	‘ Take the power , baby . ’
58180	58183	58184	58184	I	2813	‘ Okay . ’
58205	58209	58194	58194	He	536	‘ Excuse me . ’
58210	58215	58216	58216	He	536	‘ Oh , sorry . ’
58220	58231	58216	58216	He	536	‘ Do n’t fuck about , though , will you ? ’

58258	58284	58285	58285	I	2813	’ I lower gently , his grin soon disappearing , being replaced with thorough appreciation . He moans and grabs the tops of my legs . ‘
58294	58311	58312	58312	You	306	’ I lift and slowly sink back down , running my hands all over his chest . ‘
58315	58316	58319	58319	I	2813	’ ‘
58322	58340	58341	58341	You	306	’ He looks up at me and starts smoothing his hands over the tops of my thighs . ‘
58342	58346	58347	58347	I	2813	’re so handsome . ’
58357	58361	58362	58362	he	2813	‘ I know . ’
58366	58368	58362	58362	he	2813	‘ You ’re

58410	58426	58427	58428	Good girl	306	’ He ’s restraining a smile , and I scowl , but lift myself anyway . ‘
58430	58434	58427	58428	Good girl	306	’ he pants . ‘
58437	58446	58427	58428	Good girl	306	’ Sinking back down , I grind gently . ‘

58539	58548	58508	58508	He	536	’ I scream as he hits my womb . ‘
58551	58554	58555	58555	Jesse	306	’ Bang ! ‘

58566	58589	58559	58559	You	306	’ he grunts , flexing his grip of my wrists and hitting me over and over and over . My eyes close . ‘

58605	58633	58639	58639	he	306	’ Sweat is pouring down his face , dripping onto my cheeks . I need to hold onto him , scratch him and bite him , but I ’m

58669	58678	58639	58639	he	306	‘ You do , you fucking control freak ! ’
58679	58682	58689	58689	Bang	121	‘ Watch , ’
58685	58688	58689	58689	Bang	121	‘ your , ’
58691	58694	58695	58695	I	2813	‘ mouth ! ’
58698	58704	58695	58695	I	2813	‘ Fuck ! he yells . ‘
58711	58717	58709	58709	Ava	536	’ I ca n’t . I ’m

58782	58819	58757	58757	I	2813	’ And with that he shouts , grinds and collapses on top of me , releasing my hands from his fierce grip . His breathing is chaotic , his body twitching and his skin wet . I ’m

58869	58873	58851	58851	I	2813	‘ Baby , I ’m
58876	58894	58851	58851	I	2813	’ I hum again and attempt to lift my arms to cuddle him so he knows that I ’m
58920	58944	58919	58919	We	891	’re both completely shattered . I want to stay in bed , but then I feel the absence of his weight , and I ’m
58958	59016	58957	58957	I	2813	’m carried to the bathroom . He turns the spray on , grabs a towel from the shelf and chucks it on the floor of the shower before laying me down on it . I just about muster up the strength to frown up at him as he lowers himself to the floor and spreads my legs . ‘
59025	59078	58957	58957	I	2813	’ He flicks the shower to cool and settles between my thighs before really waking me up with a stretched out , agonisingly soft stroke of his tongue , right up the centre of my core . My back arches , my lifeless arms spring to life and my voice comes back . ‘
59082	59168	58957	58957	I	2813	’ I grab his wet hair and push him further into me , the previously deep , misplaced orgasm now gushing forward . I do n’t even try to control it . I start panting , my stomach muscles tensing , my head lifting , as the cool , fresh water rains all over me . He ’s everywhere , licking , biting , sucking , trailing kisses down the inside of my thighs and slowly back up again to plunge his tongue in deep . ‘
59172	59186	58957	58957	I	2813	’ he mumbles around my flesh , then bites lightly on my clit . ‘
59189	59254	58957	58957	I	2813	’ I demand , yanking at his hair . I hear him laugh a little before he follows through on my order and seals his mouth completely around me and sucks me gently to climax . I burst . I see stars . I moan and throw my hands over my head . Way too good . Just way way too bloody good . I ’m
59277	59300	59301	59301	I	2813	’m not getting up from this floor — not for anyone or anything . He can put me straight back in bed . ‘
59309	59355	59301	59301	I	2813	’ He kisses his way up my body until he finds me lips , giving me more special attention . I only respond with my mouth , unable to convince my muscles to move , and not bothering to make much effort of it either . ‘
59360	59400	59401	59401	I	2813	’ I nod against his kiss and he laughs , pulling back to study me . My eyes are still working fine . He ’s just beyond fucking beautiful , and he knows it , the big headed arse . ‘
59405	59429	59401	59401	I	2813	’ I just about manage to squeeze the words past my fitful breaths . He dazzles me with that smile … my smile . ‘
59437	59449	59430	59430	I	2813	’ He gets up , far too spritely for my liking . ‘
59469	59505	59461	59461	we	896	’ He takes my hand and heaves me up with absolutely no effort at all . And I do n’t help . I make myself a deadweight in protest , not that it hampers him . ‘
59512	59530	59507	59507	I	2813	’ I grumble , as he squirts some shampoo in my hair and starts lathering me up . ‘
59538	59550	59531	59531	You	306	’ He grins at me , and I roll my eyes . ‘

59600	59704	59596	59596	lady	2813	’ He slaps my arse and sends me on my way , while he finishes his shower . I look longingly at the bed , but as much as it ’s calling me , I resist and venture into the colossal walk - in - wardrobe to get ready . We do have time to catch up on , and we have lots of hard to catch up on , too . We ’ve broke the back of it , and this is all the more reason for me to remedy the situation that will undoubtedly take me back to being treated like I ’m
59784	59790	59779	59779	he	306	‘ What are you doing ? ’
59820	59830	59810	59810	He	306	‘ I ’ve run out of Sun - Pat . ’
59831	59834	59835	59835	I	2813	‘ What ? ’
59842	59851	59835	59835	I	2813	‘ You ’ve run out of peanut butter ? ’
59852	59859	59860	59860	He	306	‘ It ’s not fucking funny ! ’
59884	59893	59894	59894	he	306	‘ What the fuck is Cathy playing at ? ’
59958	59984	59957	59957	I	2813	’m happily tittering away when I hear the fridge door slam . I bolt upright and do a rubbish job of restraining my grin . I ’m
59995	60002	60003	60003	He	306	‘ What are you grinning at ? ’
60012	60020	60021	60021	I	2813	‘ Why the compulsion for peanut butter ? ’
60044	60049	60033	60033	He	306	‘ I like it . ’
60050	60055	60033	60033	He	306	‘ You like it ? ’

60101	60107	60108	60108	he	306	’m not in a pickle . ’
60115	60122	60108	60108	he	306	‘ It ’s no big deal . ’
60123	60126	60127	60127	I	2813	‘ Okay , ’
60163	60170	60171	60171	he	306	‘ What the hell are they ? ’
60187	60190	60174	60174	I	2813	‘ Shorts . ’
60191	60196	60197	60197	I	2813	‘ You mean knickers ? ’
60198	60202	60205	60205	I	2813	’m grinning again . ‘
60209	60226	60205	60205	I	2813	’ I grab the hem on each leg of my denim shorts and pull them up . ‘
60238	60250	60251	60251	Ava	536	’ He gasps a little , still studying the offending garment . ‘

60263	60267	60261	60261	Jesse	306	’ I sigh . ‘
60291	60323	60324	60324	I	2813	’ I pull my shorts back down and kneel to tie the laces of my Converse , ignoring the grumbling and bristling emanating from every delicious fibre of my unreasonable man . ‘
60334	60350	60324	60324	I	2813	’ I look up at him , and his grumpy face is back to horror . ‘
60355	60359	60324	60324	I	2813	’ I laugh . ‘

60435	60455	60434	60434	you	306	’re an unreasonable arse and you need to loosen up . You may be an old man , but I ’m

60486	60494	60479	60479	I	2813	’ He ’s the one smirking now . ‘
60508	60537	60538	60538	You	306	’ I grin at his repeated words from our very first meeting , and then jump up to his body , my nose diving straight into his neck . ‘
60542	60576	60538	60538	You	306	’ I inhale in his yummy scent as he carries me out to the car , still wearing the short shorts . * * * We pull up at The Manor , and I ’m
60624	60632	60633	60633	Jesse	306	‘ Ava would like to go swimming . ’
60674	60680	60681	60681	I	2813	‘ You do , girl ? ’
60684	60691	60681	60681	I	2813	‘ It ’s hot out there , ’
60710	60716	60709	60709	I	2813	’m doing . Yes , I ’m
60755	60976	60754	60754	I	2813	’m not planning on ever stripping down and prancing around for everyone to see , but a swim in a decent bikini is a good place to start . If he can overcome it here , then he can overcome it anywhere . We pass the bar , and I spot Sam . I ca n’t see his face , but his body slumped on a stool is a clear indication of how he ’s feeling . My best friend is an idiot . She ’s running away from something good , just to reignite something that ’s terribly bad . Sam might have dragged her over to the dark side , but he does n’t deserve to be crapped all over like this . As soon as we enter Jesse ’s office , he drops my hand and goes straight to the integrated fridge . He pulls out a jar of peanut butter , immediately unscrews the lid and plunges his finger in . John does n’t bat an eyelid , instead taking a seat on the other side of Jesse ’s desk , while I look on with a smile on my face . He walks casually over to his chair and takes his seat , slipping his finger into his mouth and sighing . He likes it ? ‘
60981	60989	60754	60754	I	2813	’ he asks John around his finger . ‘
61008	61022	61023	61023	I	2813	’ John shifts in his seat and pulls his phone from his pocket . ‘
61029	61048	61049	61049	Baby	88	’ He dials and puts his phone to his ear before standing and walking over to the window . ‘
61054	61074	61049	61049	Baby	88	’ I flick my eyes from John ’s back to Jesse , finding a concerned look on his face . ‘
61079	61085	61049	61049	Baby	88	’ I realise now that I ’m
61111	61116	61117	61117	His	2813	‘ Daydreaming . Sorry . ’
61125	61129	61130	61130	I	2813	‘ What about ? ’
61133	61147	61148	61148	He	2813	‘ Nothing . Just watching you settle now you have your peanut butter . ’
61159	61163	61148	61148	He	2813	‘ Want some ? ’
61164	61167	61168	61168	My	2813	‘ No . ’
61209	61214	61203	61203	He	2813	‘ How ’s Sam ? ’
61215	61229	61235	61235	I	2813	‘ Shit . He wo n’t talk about it . How ’s Kate ? ’
61230	61234	61235	61235	I	2813	‘ Not good . ’
61236	61245	61253	61253	she	916	’m not lying , she really is n’t . ‘
61257	61265	61253	61253	she	916	’ I shrug as casually as possible . ‘

61306	61317	61302	61302	He	71	‘ Do you want to swim or stay with me ? ’
61325	61333	61334	61334	I	2813	‘ What are you going to do ? ’
61365	61404	61364	61364	I	2813	’m not feeling in the slightest bit guilty about it , even if it means Jesse ’s desk looks like a bomb ’s gone off on it . He looks at the paperwork , too , and sighs . ‘
61413	61422	61364	61364	I	2813	’ He flicks through one of the piles . ‘
61431	61432	61433	61433	Ava	536	’ ‘

61713	61728	61699	61699	I	2813	‘ This sort of stuff should n’t be lying on your desk , Jesse . ’
61738	61748	61699	61699	I	2813	‘ Wait … did Sarah look after your finances ? ’
61749	61752	61753	61753	he	306	‘ Yes , ’
61767	61783	61760	61760	I	2813	‘ Do you have any idea where your money is ? How much there is ? ’
61793	61798	61799	61799	He	306	‘ Yes , look , ’

62009	62039	62044	62044	He	306	‘ For you ! The perfect solution for you ! I have a career . I am not giving it up to come here every day and file paperwork ! ’
62059	62063	62064	62064	I	2813	‘ And anyway , ’
62075	62090	62064	62064	I	2813	‘ I do n’t know how to lash a whip , so I think I ’m
62096	62137	62064	62064	I	2813	’ I do n’t know why I said that . It was unnecessary and really quite spiteful . He ’s shocked . He ’s sitting far back in his chair with a mixture of disbelief and anger on his face . ‘

62473	62482	62483	62483	I	2813	‘ I can see this pleases my wife . ’
62497	62507	62487	62487	I	2813	‘ What ’s the ratio of men to women ? ’

62562	62575	62576	62576	He	306	‘ You might have to turn The Manor into a gay club . ’
62587	62593	62576	62576	He	306	‘ Go take a swim . ’
62657	62830	62656	62656	I	2813	’m reliably informed that there ’s no skinny dipping allowed , so I ’ll brave it and put Jesse to the test at the same time . I wander through the area , looking for any sign of life , but it ’s completely deserted . It ’s lunchtime on a Sunday . I would have thought it would be a peak time for members to utilise this part of The Manor . Stepping into the huge glass building , I scan the area , finding all of the Jacuzzis , the huge pool , and the sun loungers are empty . It ’s eerily quiet , the only sound a distant hum of water pumps . Laying my towel on a plush wooden sun lounger , I gingerly take the first step into the water and sigh . It ’s tepid . Lovely . I wade down the rest of the steps and push myself into the water and start a breast stroke to the other end of the pool . I ’m
63006	63066	63002	63002	I	2813	’m yanked under the water , just catching a lungful of air before I disappear , my eyes naturally clenching shut . His lips meet mine , his arms surrounding me , and he rolls us around under the water , our skin slipping all over each other , our tongues dancing wildly . This is nice , but I ’m
63146	63221	63222	63222	You	944	’m greeted by a dirty great big grin . I know he ca n’t touch the bottom himself , so he must me treading water frantically with my dead weight clinging to him . You would never know it , though . That ’s even if he is . He looks like he ’s just floating effortlessly in front of me . I push his wet hair from his face and match his grin . ‘
63231	63232	63222	63222	You	944	’ ‘
63239	63243	63244	63244	He	2813	’re talking about . ’
63258	63269	63244	63244	He	2813	‘ It ’s never busy at this time of day . ’
63270	63277	63278	63278	I	2813	‘ I do n’t believe you . ’
63286	63305	63278	63278	I	2813	‘ You could n’t stand the thought of me in a bikini and others seeing it . Admit I ’m
63308	63338	63339	63339	I	2813	’ I ’ve got my Lord worked out . He reaches the edge of the pool and pulls me from his back , pushing me up against the side . ‘
63349	63350	63339	63339	I	2813	’ ‘
63357	63358	63359	63359	I	2813	’ ‘
63382	63395	63367	63367	I	2813	’ He slides his hands down my sides and onto my thighs . ‘
63401	63425	63367	63367	I	2813	’ he whispers . It makes me immediately clench my thighs as he leans in and kisses me gently before scanning my face . ‘
63431	63454	63367	63367	I	2813	’ His finger slips into the side of my bikini bottoms , and I hold my breath as he strokes me softly . ‘
63472	63473	63474	63474	I	2813	’ ‘
63477	63492	63474	63474	I	2813	’ I shift in front of him and drape my arms over his shoulders . ‘
63498	63637	63496	63496	me	2813	’ I dive right in and show my appreciation with a long , hot , passionate kiss that draws a low moan from each of us . His hands shift to my waist , his big hands circling me completely as he holds me tight , and we kiss for the longest time — there in the middle of the pool , just me and him , drowning in each other , consuming each other , loving each other . Everything that happens between us is a result of the potent , sometimes poisonous , love we share . It pushes us to behave erratically and unreasonably — both of us . In reality , we are probably level pegging in the crazy department , or maybe I have overtaken him . I certainly feel crazy . What I ’m
63675	63680	63665	63665	him	948	‘ I love you . ’
63697	63700	63701	63701	I	2813	‘ Hmmm . ’
63711	63719	63701	63701	I	2813	‘ Ava , it ’s seven thirty . ’
63720	63724	63725	63725	I	2813	‘ I know . ’
63731	63735	63736	63736	I	2813	‘ Sleepy sex . ’
63750	63759	63760	63760	Baby	88	’m looking for . I grasp him loosely . ‘
63775	63787	63788	63788	He	948	’re going to fly into panic and leave me halfway finished . ’
63805	63827	63828	63828	My	2813	‘ It ’s Monday morning . It ’s seven thirty . I do n’t want the blame for making you late . ’
63876	63882	63866	63866	he	948	‘ What time is it ? ’
63887	63893	63883	63883	He	948	‘ It ’s seven thirty . ’
63894	63897	63898	63898	I	2813	‘ Jesse ! ’
63907	63921	63898	63898	I	2813	‘ Why did n’t you wake me when you went for a run ? ’
63939	63948	63949	63949	He	948	‘ I did n’t want to disturb you . ’
63973	63980	63962	63962	He	948	‘ Never … bother … fore . ’
63993	63996	63989	63989	His	948	‘ Pardon ? ’
64017	64042	64043	64043	I	2813	‘ I said it never bothered you before . Why did n’t you drag me out of bed and punish me with fourteen miles ? ’
64044	64066	64067	64067	I	2813	’m suspicious , and you can tell . He shrugs and joins me by the mirror , grabbing his own toothbrush . ‘
64075	64076	64067	64067	I	2813	’ ‘
64082	64205	64206	64206	I	2813	’ I wo n’t push it . I step in the shower and make a quick job of washing my hair and shaving before stepping out and practically running into the walk - in - wardrobe . I stand and stare at the rails and rails of clothes , mostly all with tags still attached . It feels like hard work trying to choose , there ’s way too much , so I yank down my red shift dress . That ’ll do . By the time I ’ve rough dried my hair , haphazardly slapped on my make - up , and landed downstairs , Jesse is suited up in navy with a crisp white shirt and collecting his car keys . ‘

64283	64332	64280	64280	I	2813	’ We make our way down to the foyer of Lusso and as we approach the concierge desk , I see Cathy leaning up , chatting with Clive . I grin and look up to Jesse , but he ignores me , even though he knows damn well I ’m

64537	64541	64542	64542	I	2813	’re only talking . ’
64559	64565	64566	64566	He	306	‘ It ’s not right , ’

64906	64926	64927	64927	You	963	’m not driving that thing , no matter how many countdowns or sense fucks I get as a consequence . ‘
64933	64946	64947	64947	I	2813	’ He sounds hurt . Oh shit , what do I say ? ‘

Even the carpets are white . I look up at him , my deluded husband , and shake my head , but I ca n’t be ungrateful . He looks so pleased with himself . I thought this man had taste . ‘

66001	66010	66000	66000	I	2813	’m released and , as ever , breathless . ‘

66140	66147	66133	66133	You	2813	’ It ’s not a question . ‘
66152	66157	66162	66162	lady	2813	’ I repeat touchily . ‘
66164	66179	66162	66162	lady	2813	’ His eyes are giving me a thorough warning , but I ignore it . ‘
66191	66267	66268	66268	Darling	61	’ He starts laughing and strolls off to move my car before jumping in his DBS and screeching out of the car park . * * * After driving around the nearest car park for an age , I finally find two spaces to straddle . Bursting through the door , the first thing I see is a bunch of Calla lilies spread on my desk and as I get nearer , a little box . ‘
66270	66283	66268	66268	Darling	61	’ Tom ’s croon does n’t distract me from the small box . ‘
66286	66299	66300	66300	You	61	’ I greet , taking a seat and picking up the box . ‘
66303	66304	66305	66305	Chirpy	125	’ ‘
66310	66336	66337	66337	I	2813	’ Tom sounds curious now and that does have my eyes dragging away from the box as I remember the last time I saw him . ‘
66338	66341	66342	66342	I	2813	’m good , ’
66357	66380	66381	66381	He	125	‘ I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again . God , that man can do a sexy brood ! ’
66391	66394	66381	66381	He	125	‘ Hot ! ’
66413	66418	66419	66419	I	2813	‘ Who delivered this ? ’
66427	66431	66432	66432	Tom	84	‘ Flower girl . ’
66485	66488	66489	66489	Sally	60	‘ Wow ! ’
66499	66510	66492	66492	she	60	‘ Wow , wow , wow ! That ’s beautiful ! ’
66533	66537	66538	66538	I	2813	‘ I know . ’
66542	66547	66538	66538	I	2813	‘ Thanks , Sal . ’
66563	66572	66573	66573	Sal	60	‘ Would you like a coffee , Ava ? ’
66580	66589	66573	66573	Sal	60	‘ Please . Where are Patrick and Victoria ? ’
66590	66604	66573	66573	Sal	60	‘ Patrick has a personal meeting and Victoria is on a site visit . ’
66605	66610	66573	66573	Sal	60	‘ Oh , okay . ’
66730	66814	66815	66815	Ava	536	’m soon halted mid - resolute march when the main office comes into view , and I clock someone sat in one of the tub chairs opposite my desk . Sarah . I do n’t feel ill anymore . I feel angry . What the fucking hell is she doing here ? As much as I ’d love to rip her to shreds , I do n’t want to in my office , so I turn to escape and hide in the toilets . ‘
66817	66843	66815	66815	Ava	536	’ I snap out of my shocked , fleeing state and turn towards the voice — the voice I ’ve not heard for weeks . I ’m
66865	66868	66869	66869	I	2813	‘ Sarah . ’
66874	66923	66873	66873	I	2813	’m reeling . Is she going to add to my grievances ? She ’s looking rather understated , her hair softer than usual and her boobs tucked neatly behind a substantial cropped jacket , the short dresses side - lined for a respectful , knee length matching skirt . ‘
66929	66933	66934	66934	I	2813	’ I ask . ‘
66941	66971	66934	66934	I	2813	’ She shifts in the chair uncomfortably , her usual cocky demeanour nowhere in sight . I ’ve been caught completely off guard . Is she playing games again ? ‘
66974	66979	66934	66934	I	2813	’ I ask cautiously . ‘
66983	67026	66934	66934	I	2813	’ I ’ve got nothing to say to this woman . She glances around the office , as do I. Tom is ever my nosey , gay friend and looking curiously across at the strange woman who ’s sitting at my desk . ‘
67035	67074	67075	67075	I	2813	’ she asks , returning her eyes to mine . Whilst I should be telling her where to go , curiosity is getting the better of me . I walk over to my desk and grab my bag , ‘
67081	67185	67075	67075	I	2813	’ I say curtly , leaving her behind and walking out of my office . My heart is pumping too fast for my liking . I thought I ’d seen the back of this whip wielding witch , and now I ’ve clapped eyes on her again , all of the torment and drama she ’s caused is fresh and clear in my mind . All I can see are lash marks on Jesse , his tortured face and my pitiful body draped over him . She has a nerve . I walk into the nearby Starbucks and settle in a chair . I ’m
67235	67242	67243	67243	she	992	‘ Would you like a drink ? ’
67257	67259	67252	67252	I	2813	‘ I ’m
67262	67268	67252	67252	I	2813	’ She smiles a little . ‘
67299	67300	67296	67296	you	2813	’ ‘
67303	67641	67296	67296	you	2813	’ I shake my head and watch her go quietly to the counter , ensuring she ’s busy ordering before I pull my phone from my bag to text Kate . I need to vent . The cheeky bitch has turned up at my office ! She replies immediately . Granted , it was n’t the sort of text that you could cast aside with the intention to reply soon . No ! ! ! ! ! Really ? Ava , stop talking in fucking code ! Who ’s the cheeky bitch ? I almost let an exasperated curse fall from my lips . Sarah ! Her reply is instant again . Noooooooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! My fingers work fast across the pad as I look up to check that Sarah ’s still being served . Fucking yes ! ! ! ! ! Will call u. I go to slip my phone in my bag , but it chimes instantly again . I can imagine her gasping , her pale fingers flying across the buttons of her phone . She ’s probably driving , too . Call me now , put it on the table . I want 2 hear what she ’s got 2 say ! I do scoff out loud this time , shaking my head . She would never keep her gob shut if she heard something that she did n’t like , and then I would be explaining the distant sounds of my screeching best friend . No I press send and smile when she immediately texts back ; Bitch ! I shove my phone back in my bag when Sarah approaches with a coffee , crossing my legs and maintaining a look of complete hatred . I do . I hate her . I hate everything she represents , but most of all , I hate her for inflicting pain on Jesse . I should stop thinking . I ’m
67667	67678	67652	67652	She	994	‘ I wanted to apologise for everything that ’s happened . ’
67679	67683	67684	67684	I	2813	‘ You do ? ’
67687	67694	67695	67695	She	994	‘ Are you winding me up ? ’
67706	67710	67695	67695	She	994	‘ Ava , I ’m
67725	67726	67716	67716	I	2813	’ ‘
67729	67736	67716	67716	I	2813	’ I say on a frown . ‘
67762	67763	67757	67757	I	2813	’ ‘
67767	67773	67774	67774	I	2813	’re in love with him . ’
67785	67796	67797	67797	She	994	‘ Why else would you behave like that , Sarah ? ’
67827	67829	67837	67837	Ava	536	‘ I ’m
67854	67862	67850	67850	I	2813	’ She returns her eyes to mine . ‘
67871	67872	67876	67876	him	2813	’ ‘
67878	67885	67874	67874	you	2813	’ I do n’t get it . ‘
67896	67901	67874	67874	you	2813	’ She laughs mildly . ‘
67924	67928	67920	67920	I	2813	’ I wince . ‘
67931	67932	67933	67933	Jesse	306	’ ‘
67940	67941	67933	67933	Jesse	306	’ ‘
67949	68009	67933	67933	Jesse	306	’ I say candidly . Jesse has admitted that to me , and I know he was never whipped before that horrible day when I found them in his office . She must have been in her element , especially when she managed to entice me to The Manor to witness the whole horror scene . She looks surprised . ‘
68016	68031	67933	67933	Jesse	306	’ She ’s definitely holding back tears . I ’ve really misjudged this issue . ‘
68059	68061	68049	68049	He	306	’ I ’m
68071	68117	68118	68118	You	997	’m not overly happy about the reminder of Jesse ’s history . He screwed all over the place , took anything , anytime … except Sarah . The Manor is full of willing women , none more than Sarah , and he never wanted her . ‘
68130	68147	68152	68152	he	306	’ The words turn my stomach . I feel sick again . She shakes her head . ‘
68184	68185	68173	68174	Jesse Ward	306	’ ‘
68197	68198	68186	68186	You	997	’ ‘
68221	68281	68282	68282	Sarah	60	’ I did run a mile , but I went back . It did n’t take Sarah ’s intervention to get me running after I discovered the drunken Jesse , though . I look at the woman across the table from me , and I feel sorry for her . I hate myself for it , but I do . ‘
68291	68297	68284	68284	he	1000	’ I ca n’t believe I ’m
68311	68317	68318	68318	She	464	‘ Yes , he does . ’
68335	68391	68392	68392	She	464	‘ After what you did , and seeing how he reacted to that , it made me realise how stupid I ’d been . He deserves happiness . He deserves you . You love him despite The Manor , what he did , and his problem with alcohol . You love him in his entirety . ’
68395	68414	68415	68415	I	2813	‘ You ’ve made him feel . I should never have tried to take that away from him . ’
68416	68446	68447	68447	You	1003	’m sitting in a stunned silence , just staring at her , with not a clue of what to say in response . What do I say to that ? ‘
68453	68463	68464	68464	I	2813	’ So I say that ? Her eyes widen . ‘
68475	68573	68473	68473	you	1003	’ No , it could n’t . Despite her confessions , I could never trust her or even like her . I can feel a little sorry for her , but I could never invite her back into our lives . I ’ve never asked Jesse what happened when he fired her . He made it clear it was n’t up for discussion and being delighted that she was out of the picture , I did n’t push it . But now , more than ever , I really want to know what happened during that conversation . ‘
68587	68601	68602	68602	You	1003	’ I ask , although I already know the answer to that question . ‘
68665	68670	68662	68663	The Lord	536	’ She stands up . ‘
68689	68797	68800	68800	she	1008	’ She leaves . As I watch her back disappear out of Starbucks , I feel tearful again . I ’ve won The Lord . I ’ve changed him . I ’ve made him stop drinking and fucking around . I ’ve made him feel and love . And he does love . He loves really hard , and I love him really hard , too . I need to see him . I really need to see him . Damn Ruth Quinn and her demanding arse . I jump up and race to the car park to collect my present , calling Kate on the way . ‘
68803	68815	68800	68800	she	1008	’ she screeches down the phone before it ’s even rung . ‘
68818	68820	68800	68800	she	1008	’ I ’m
68825	68829	68831	68832	the baby	1009	‘ Anyway , I ’m
68834	68840	68831	68832	the baby	1009	’ She laughs at me . ‘
68850	68882	68883	68883	Ava	536	’ I smile as I run towards the car park , keen to get my appointment with Ruth out of the way so I can get to Jesse . * * * ‘
68885	68893	68896	68896	Ruth	87	’ Her smiley face almost irritates me . ‘
68898	68933	68896	68896	Ruth	87	’ I practically push past her into the shell of a kitchen , doing a quick analyse . Everything looks like it ’s on track . Nothing is jumping out as being a problem . ‘
68947	68954	68942	68942	I	2813	’ I turn to face her . ‘
68959	68964	68942	68942	I	2813	’ She looks hopeful . ‘
68974	69010	69011	69011	I	2813	’ I ask , trying to prompt her along , but she does n’t look like she ’s in a hurry as she meanders over to a makeshift table and starts faffing with a mug . ‘
69032	69041	69042	69042	I	2813	’ I screw my face up in frustration . ‘
69043	69058	69059	69059	I	2813	’m sorry , I double booked , Ruth . Can we re - arrange ? ’
69060	69064	69059	69059	I	2813	’m feeling panicky . ‘
69073	69099	69059	69059	I	2813	’ She carries on about her slow business , while I shift impatiently behind her . You would think she was doing this on purpose . ‘
69110	69129	69101	69101	you	1012	’ The question throws me , but I quickly engage my brain before I drop myself in it . ‘
69137	69138	69101	69101	you	1012	’ ‘
69149	69162	69101	69101	you	1012	’ She lazily strolls over to the fridge to get the milk . ‘
69167	69178	69101	69101	you	1012	’ I ca n’t help the irritation in my tone . ‘
69194	69199	69183	69183	I	2813	’ she says casually . ‘
69209	69220	69183	69183	I	2813	’ She pours the milk leisurely and stirs even slower . ‘
69229	69230	69183	69183	I	2813	’ ‘
69233	69236	69183	69183	I	2813	’ Shit ! ‘
69258	69327	69249	69249	I	2813	’ My fingers are twisting wildly in my hair . Why am I even lying to her ? What I do and when I do it is none of her business . She turns with a smile , but then her eyes fall on my left hand and there is no mistaking the eye bulge . I look at my diamond adorned ring finger and suddenly feel uneasy . ‘
69336	69340	69328	69328	You	1017	’ she laughs . ‘
69366	69428	69348	69348	me	2813	’ She actually starts blushing , and a horrible realisation kicks in . She ’s gay ! Oh no ! Oh fucking hell ! That would explain it , all of the invitations to drinks , the persistent calling and meetings , and now her eyes bulging at my rings . She fancies me . Now I really do feel uncomfortable . ‘
69432	69436	69348	69348	me	2813	’ She frowns . ‘
69446	69451	69443	69444	a boyfriend	1019	’ Her frown deepens . ‘
69463	69470	69443	69444	a boyfriend	1019	’ I shift on my heels . ‘
69477	69479	69471	69471	I	2813	’ I ’m
69485	69494	69495	69495	I	2813	‘ My rings were being re - sized . ’
69511	69518	69519	69519	She	1019	‘ Why did n’t you say ? ’
69533	69545	69547	69547	she	1019	‘ It was a low - key affair . Just family . ’
69582	69605	69606	69606	Ruth	87	’m pregnant too ? By , the look on her face , it would probably finish her off . She looks hurt . ‘
69627	69633	69634	69634	She	1019	’m sorry to do this . ’
69651	69661	69662	69662	I	2813	‘ No , you go . It can wait . ’
69663	69725	69662	69662	I	2813	’m relieved but shocked . Maybe this was the best thing that could ’ve happened . Will she ease off on the persistent offers of drinks and meetings ? I ca n’t believe I did n’t see this before . A woman who looks like this with no man ? I do n’t dwell on it for long , though . I ’m
69740	69752	69753	69753	I	2813	‘ Thank you , Ruth . We ’ll re - arrange . ’
69774	69848	69849	69849	Ava	536	’m such a fool . I run down the path and jump into my shiny new car , nearly breaking down in tears when Angel hits my eardrums . * * * I frantically stab at the button on the intercom , but after a few agonising minutes , the gates still are n’t opening , so I dive into my bag and retrieve my phone to dial him . It rings once . ‘

69859	69868	69879	69879	him	536	’ I sound distressed and crazy , but I ’m

69928	69932	69927	69927	You	536	’re worrying me . ’
69933	69938	69939	69939	I	2813	‘ I need you . ’
69960	69967	69939	69939	I	2813	‘ Jesse , I need you . ’
69982	69991	69978	69978	He	536	‘ Pull down the sun visor , baby . ’
70053	70137	70139	70139	him	1022	’m crying hard now , painful , aching , heavy tears as I weave up the tree lined driveway in a blur until I see Jesse ’s Aston Martin come speeding from the other direction . I slam my brakes on and jump out , running at full pelt toward him . He looks absolutely terrified as he flies from his car , leaving the door open , and sprints towards his crazy , hysterical wife . I ca n’t help it , I ’m
70181	70187	70191	70191	him	1022	’ crash together , and I ’m
70202	70228	70201	70201	I	2813	’m lifted and held tight to his body . I sob relentlessly into his neck as he paces around the driveway just holding me . I ’m
70233	70243	70244	70244	Jesus	306	’m such a stupid , selfish , heartless cow . ‘
70248	70255	70256	70256	I	2813	’ he pants into my neck . ‘
70257	70260	70261	70261	I	2813	’m sorry . ’
70280	70285	70268	70268	I	2813	‘ What ’s happened ? ’
70286	70296	70297	70297	I	2813	‘ Nothing . I just needed to see you . ’
70310	70320	70321	70321	He	1022	‘ Fucking hell , Ava ! Please , explain ! ’
70344	70347	70328	70328	I	2813	‘ Ava ? ’
70348	70354	70321	70321	He	1022	‘ Can we go home ? ’
70355	70367	70328	70328	I	2813	‘ No ! Not until you tell me why the fuck you ’re
70373	70384	70328	70328	I	2813	’ he shouts , battling with my clutching arms . I ’m
70421	70427	70413	70413	he	1022	‘ What ’s going on ? ’
70428	70430	70413	70413	he	1022	‘ I ’m
70433	70437	70438	70438	I	2813	’ I sob . ‘
70444	70447	70448	70448	He	1022	’m sorry . ’
70468	70471	70472	70472	I	2813	‘ What ? ’
70531	70538	70539	70539	I	2813	‘ You make me so mad . ’
70543	70564	70539	70539	I	2813	‘ You make me mad and then you make me so happy . I did n’t know what to do . ’
70602	70615	70597	70597	He	1022	‘ Fuck ! Ava , are you trying to get me sectioned ? ’
70631	70664	70624	70624	he	1022	‘ Are you fucking with my mind because I really do n’t need this , lady . I ’ve just got my head around you not pregnant , and now you are ? ’
70665	70671	70672	70672	His	1022	‘ I always have been . ’
70700	70709	70688	70688	he	1022	‘ When were you going to tell me ? ’
70710	70716	70717	70717	I	2813	‘ When I accepted it . ’
70723	70775	70776	70776	We	1025	’m lying , and my lack of need to try and restrain my natural reflex is telling me so . Maybe I was trying to make the most of dominant Jesse before he starts treating me like glass again . I do n’t even know . I ’ve been so stupid . ‘
70777	70782	70783	70783	He	1022	’re having a baby ? ’
70849	70882	70848	70848	I	2813	’m just standing and crying , watching his slumped body silently shedding tears in front of me . I really have fucked with his head , as if he needs it where I ’m
70942	70946	70947	70947	I	2813	’m really here . ‘
70948	70952	70953	70953	I	2813	’m so sorry . ’
71149	71154	71155	71155	She	1284	‘ Is everything okay ? ’
71202	71205	71198	71198	He	1026	‘ Boy ? ’
71210	71222	71223	71223	He	1026	‘ Everything is fine . Ava ’s not feeling too well . ’
71237	71242	71243	71243	I	2813	‘ Are you coming ? ’
71246	71257	71258	71258	He	1026	‘ I ’ll be up in a minute . Go . ’
71279	71301	71302	71302	I	2813	’m passing Jesse ’s sweet housekeeper , she reaches out and gently strokes my shoulder , giving me a small smile . ‘
71303	71306	71309	71309	Ava	536	’m glad you ’re
71311	71336	71309	71309	Ava	536	’ I return her smile . It ’s a feeble smile . I feel uncertain and a little concerned by Jesse ’s despondent state . ‘
71340	71560	71309	71309	Ava	536	’ I make my way upstairs , entering the master - suite and settling on the end of the bed . Not knowing what to do , I kick my shoes off and shuffle myself up the bed a little more . My eyes are brimming with tears again as I clutch my knees to my chest and wait for him . I know that right now is when we ’ll talk about this , now we have both acknowledged what is happening ; but in order to have a talk , both of us need to be speaking , and Jesse does n’t look like he plans on saying anything . I have no idea what is going through that crazy mind of his and the strained atmosphere is pushing doubts back into me . I need reassurance , not silence , not time to talk my way back out of this . My head snaps up when he enters the bedroom , but he does n’t look at me . Instead , he goes straight to the bathroom . I hear the waterfall tap of the bath start pouring and the faffing of his movements as he follows through on his usual bath time routine , collecting everything he ’ll need and placing it within reach . We ’re
71653	71659	71660	71660	he	306	‘ Is the water okay ? ’
71675	71680	71660	71660	he	306	‘ It ’s fine , ’
71739	71744	71738	71738	I	2813	’m a little confused . ‘
71751	71778	71738	71738	I	2813	’ I ask quietly . I want him to lay behind me so I can feel him , take comfort in him . I need that . ‘
71785	71832	71738	71738	I	2813	’ His voice is low and unsure . I do n’t like it . I turn myself around to face him , finding glazed green eyes and a stoic expression . It pulls at my heart . I ’ve really fucked with his mind this time . ‘
71840	71856	71738	71738	I	2813	’ I reach up with my wet hand and lay my palm on his cheek . ‘
71859	71999	71738	71738	I	2813	’ He watches me carefully for a few moments , like he ’s deciding whether he should , but he eventually sighs and drops the sponge , before he stands and slowly removes his clothes . Stepping in behind me , he lowers himself to cocoon me completely . I feel immediately better with his warm hardness cradling me , but I ca n’t see him , so I turn over and sit on his lap , encouraging his knees up so I can lean back and look at him . I take his hands and interlace our fingers , and we both watch in silence as we play with each other ’s hands , our tangled fingers glimmering now and then when our rings catch the reflections of the water . It ’s not a difficult silence anymore . ‘
72009	72049	72050	72050	I	2813	’ he whispers , still watching our snaking fingers working together . My movements falter for a few moments but do n’t stop completely . It ’s a question that I predicted and it ’s one that needs answering . ‘
72055	72059	72054	72054	I	2813	’m still scared . ’
72085	72089	72090	72090	he	536	‘ Of me , ’
72094	72096	72090	72090	he	536	‘ You ’re
72101	72127	72128	72128	I	2813	’ He does n’t elaborate , and he does n’t need to . I know what he means , and he knows that , too . ‘
72129	72137	72128	72128	I	2813	’m scared of how you ’ll be . ’
72138	72144	72145	72145	he	536	‘ You mean more crazy . ’
72156	72172	72145	72145	he	536	‘ It was n’t even definite and you were treating me like a priceless object . ’
72201	72215	72193	72193	he	536	‘ You also think that I might love our child more than you . ’
72224	72292	72193	72193	he	536	’re the words I have refused to acknowledge every time they ’ve whirled around in my head . I am worried that he ’ll love our child more than me . Selfishly , yes , it frightens me to death . The unreasonable thought has been lingering there somewhere , I ’ll admit it to myself now . I ’ve not long had his love , and I ’m
72312	72330	72332	72332	you	1042	’m not ready to share him , not with anyone , not even a part of us . ‘
72334	72340	72332	72332	you	1042	’ I ask quietly . I ’m
72385	72389	72384	72384	I	2813	’m not sure . ‘
72395	72409	72384	72384	I	2813	’ He flattens my palms on his chest and holds them there firmly . ‘
72501	72503	72497	72497	Children	1046	’ I ’m
72523	72534	72535	72535	He	222	‘ I never want to be without your fierce love . ’
72557	72619	72625	72625	Ava	536	‘ You wo n’t be . I ’ll never stop loving you hard . It ’ll only get harder because every day that passes we create more memories . Memories I ’ll treasure , not memories I want to forget . My mind is being filled with beautiful images of us , and they are replacing a history that lingers . They ’re
72635	72636	72637	72637	You	1049	’ ‘
72641	72653	72637	72637	You	1049	’ I breathe , shifting my hands up to his shoulders . ‘
72661	72667	72637	72637	You	1049	’ He kisses me gently . ‘
72673	72702	72703	72703	I	2813	’ I sit up on his lap and pull him up with me , wrapping my arms so tightly around him and pushing my mouth to his ear . ‘
72704	72711	72712	72712	I	2813	’m crazy in love with you . ’
72715	72730	72712	72712	I	2813	‘ Fiercely , too . That ’s never going to stop , not ever . ’
72736	72740	72741	72741	His	2813	‘ End of . ’
72751	72759	72741	72741	His	2813	‘ Good . My heart is swelling . ’
72781	72841	72780	72780	I	2813	’m sprawled across his chest . We just kiss , for a long , long time . It ’s gentle and sweet , but it ’s what we both need right now . Pure , unapologetic , powerful love . It ’s potent . It overpowers us both . He pulls back and encases my face with his hands . ‘
72847	72848	72850	72850	I	2813	’ ‘
72851	72854	72850	72850	I	2813	’m comfy . ’
72871	72879	72870	72870	I	2813	’m forced to vacate the giant tub . ‘
72896	72901	72902	72902	I	2813	’re supposed to be . ’
72905	72914	72915	72915	I	2813	‘ It ’s not even mid - afte … ’
72918	72927	72915	72915	I	2813	‘ I ’ve not gone back to work ! ’
72940	72951	72939	72939	I	2813	’m swiftly restrained and pulled back down to his chest . ‘
72963	72964	72962	72962	lady	2813	’ ‘
72967	72968	72962	72962	lady	2813	’ ‘
72975	72991	72962	72962	lady	2813	’ He turns me around in his lap and retrieves the sponge from the water . ‘
72998	72999	73001	73001	you	2813	’ ‘
73002	73005	73001	73001	you	2813	’re ill . ’
73006	73014	73015	73015	I	2813	‘ He ’ll be sacking me soon . ’
73161	73165	73166	73166	he	2813	‘ Stay there . ’
73185	73191	73192	73192	I	2813	‘ Where are you going ? ’
73197	73201	73192	73192	I	2813	‘ Just wait . ’
73233	73238	73239	73239	I	2813	‘ What ’s that ? ’
73301	73308	73309	73309	I	2813	‘ You do n’t believe me ? ’
73310	73331	73334	73334	I	2813	’m hurt and it ’s obvious . He rolls his eyes and reaches in , pulling out a pregnancy test . ‘
73337	73338	73334	73334	I	2813	’ ‘
73349	73382	73334	73334	I	2813	’ I grab it and tip it upside down , emptying the little boxes into the sink next to me . I start picking them up and chucking them on the counter . ‘
73407	73438	73334	73334	I	2813	’ I turn my eyes back to my mad - cap husband and wave one of the boxes under his nose . He shrugs sheepishly and bats the box away . ‘

73450	73462	73334	73334	I	2813	’ I blurt . He starts opening one of the boxes . ‘
73471	73477	73478	73478	He	1056	’re just back - ups . ’
73502	73514	73515	73515	I	2813	‘ You have to pee on this bit here , look . ’
73537	73564	73517	73517	him	1056	‘ I did one at the Doctor ’s , Jesse . I know how they work . Why wo n’t you take my word for it ? ’
73580	73598	73565	73565	His	1056	‘ I do take your word for it , but I need to see it for myself . ’
73635	73643	73644	73644	He	1056	‘ How long have you had these ? ’
73676	73679	73671	73671	They	1057	‘ Give , ’
73735	73746	73734	73734	I	2813	’m being ridiculous . I jump down from the unit . ‘
73751	73763	73764	73764	I	2813	’ He recoils , a look of disbelief on his face . ‘
73765	73768	73769	73769	he	1056	’m staying . ’
73773	73775	73769	73769	he	1056	‘ I ’m
73786	73792	73796	73796	Ward	306	’ I shake my head . ‘
73798	73819	73796	73796	Ward	306	’ He sits down on the floor in front of me , his towel gaping open and revealing … everything . ‘
73823	73835	73836	73836	I	2813	’ He ’s fighting a smug grin from his lush lips . ‘
73842	73864	73836	73836	I	2813	’ I retort haughtily as I sidestep him to exit the bathroom . I yelp as my ankle is grasped and I ’m
73875	73878	73879	73879	I	2813	‘ Jesse ! ’
73927	73935	73936	73936	He	2813	‘ Humour me , baby . Please . ’
73969	73977	73956	73956	he	2813	‘ Can you at least turn around ? ’
73978	73981	73982	73982	He	2813	‘ No , ’

74034	74042	74030	74030	I	2813	‘ No , that just distracts me . ’
74099	74106	74085	74085	His	2813	‘ You wield that physique unfairly . ’
74107	74121	74122	74122	He	2813	‘ Of course I do . It ’s one of my best assets . ’
74131	74141	74142	74142	His	2813	‘ It comes a close second to this one . ’
74156	74160	74151	74151	he	2813	‘ Just perfect . ’

74174	74192	74151	74151	he	2813	’ I grumble , suddenly realising that I will , in fact , get fat and swollen . ‘
74212	74229	74207	74207	I	2813	’ I snatch the towel up and re - wrap myself , ignoring his obvious annoyance . ‘
74237	74251	74207	74207	I	2813	’ he threatens , taking my hand and leading me to the toilet . ‘
74267	74278	74259	74259	I	2813	’ He ’s looking down at me with a smirk . ‘
74287	74304	74305	74305	He	2813	’m unable to reach your cock with my mouth because my belly is in the way . ’
74314	74320	74305	74305	He	2813	‘ I promise , baby . ’
74322	74333	74321	74321	I	2813	’m turned around and positioned in front of the toilet . ‘
74343	74365	74321	74321	I	2813	’ I hitch up my towel and reluctantly lower myself to the toilet , while Jesse crouches in front of me . ‘
74378	74400	74321	74321	I	2813	’ I grin as I watch his lips twitch at the memory of me sitting on his arm in the hospital . ‘
74407	74456	74457	74457	Ava	536	’ He ’s trying his hardest , but failing miserably . He collapses onto his arse and laughs . It makes me feel so much better . While my hysterical husband rolls around on the floor , I hold the stick between my thighs and release my bladder . ‘
74468	74497	74457	74457	Ava	536	’ He pulls himself up and kneels again , resting his palms on my thighs , and leans up to kiss me hard on the lips … while I ’m
74503	74506	74507	74507	I	2813	‘ There . ’
74528	74531	74532	74532	I	2813	‘ What ? ’
74541	74554	74555	74555	He	536	‘ I told you , sometimes they do n’t work . Quick . ’
74591	74597	74603	74603	He	536	‘ Jesse , come on ! ’
74598	74602	74603	74603	He	536	‘ One more . ’
74608	74614	74603	74603	He	536	‘ For God ’s sake . ’
74628	74633	74634	74634	I	2813	‘ That ’s it ! ’
74659	74662	74663	74663	I	2813	‘ There . ’
74730	74736	74737	74737	I	2813	‘ Are you okay there ? ’
74752	74756	74737	74737	I	2813	‘ I think they ’re
74765	74777	74759	74759	We	1062	’ He makes to shift , but I grab his arm . ‘
74784	74788	74759	74759	We	1062	’ I laugh , ‘
74795	74824	74759	74759	We	1062	’ I take his hands and hold them under the tap while he keeps his eyes on the test , not paying a bit of attention to what I ’m
74827	74835	74836	74836	he	536	‘ It ’s been longer than that . ’
74839	74843	74836	74836	he	536	‘ Much longer . ’
74844	74854	74855	74855	I	2813	‘ No it has n’t . Stop being neurotic . ’
74897	74899	74890	74890	He	536	‘ I ’m
74903	74904	74907	74907	you	2765	’ ‘
74908	74911	74912	74912	I	2813	’re not . ’
74915	74927	74907	74907	you	2765	‘ Are you taking the piss out of me , lady ? ’
74928	74936	74890	74890	He	536	‘ Not at all , My Lord . ’
74994	75092	74993	74993	I	2813	’m mimicking my challenging man , who ’s suddenly gone rigid next to me . Time seems to slow slightly as the letters form and we both stare in silence . My heart picks up pace as my eyes drift over to the next test and find the slow development of the same letters . My heart is now trying to break free from my chest and our heads inch to the left a little to watch as the very same letters appear on the third and final test . It ’s only now I realise that I ’m
75141	75149	75140	75140	We	1065	’re still bent over the unit , we ’re
75160	75165	75168	75168	Daddy	128	’re both completely expressionless . ‘
75170	75186	75168	75168	Daddy	128	’ I whisper , my voice quivering slightly as I watch him scanning my face . ‘
75190	75195	75196	75196	I	2813	’ he whispers back . ‘
75201	75243	75196	75196	I	2813	’ He collapses to the floor on his back and stares up at the ceiling . Why the shocked reaction ? He wanted this . I straighten myself out and roll my shoulder blades a little . I feel all stiff . ‘
75248	75298	75196	75196	I	2813	’ I ask , looking down at him . This was n’t what I expected , but then his mouth starts twitching and his greens land on me . He jumps up and seizes me in his arms , lifting me clean from my feet on a shocked squeal . ‘
75306	75553	75554	75554	I	2813	’ He paces quickly into the bedroom and places me down way too gently on the bed , yanking my towel away before crawling up above me and settling his body between my thighs and resting his chin on my stomach . He looks up at me with the most incredible amount of contentment in his eyes . They are twinkling madly , his damp hair is all over the place and his frown line and chewed lip are nowhere to be seen . How could I have ever doubted this when he ’s looking so relaxed , like I ’ve just given him life ? Well , I have , I suppose . Or he has given life to me . Either or , my husband is one happy man , and now that I may have gotten my own head around this , I can see clearly — very , very clearly . He has more than enough love to share . This devastating man , this ex - playboy , will be an amazing daddy , if a little over - protective . I ’ve not just given him life , a life revived and worthy , by giving him me , I ’ve given him new life , too — a part of him and a part of me combined . And seeing him so unbelievably euphoric has chased away every single doubt . I can have a baby with this man . ‘
75558	75563	75554	75554	I	2813	’ he says quietly . ‘
75567	75571	75572	75572	I	2813	’ I smile . ‘
75575	75591	75572	75572	I	2813	’ He presses his lips to my stomach tenderly , and then strokes it softly . ‘
75599	75643	75572	75572	I	2813	’ he whispers to my flat belly . He circles his nose around my bellybutton before he works his way up the bed and lays himself all over me . My hair is brushed from my face and he gazes down at me . ‘
75669	75670	75671	75671	I	2813	’ ‘
75688	75689	75691	75691	me	2813	’ ‘
75694	75698	75691	75691	me	2813	’ he prompts . ‘

75733	75778	75779	75779	You	2813	’ He drops a chaste kiss on my lips , and I struggle to prevent a laugh . He does n’t know ? We could be here for the rest of the year , but I ’ll focus on my main grievance for now . ‘
75813	75823	75806	75806	I	2813	’ He pulls back and his eyebrows shoot up . ‘
75833	75834	75835	75835	You	2813	’ ‘
75836	75848	75849	75849	I	2813	’re addictive , and lately I ’ve been having Jesse withdrawal . ’
75850	75887	75888	75888	I	2813	’m frank and honest with my answer . I need to get this out because another eight - ish months with gentle Jesse might send me crazy . His frown line flickers straight across his brow . ‘
75895	75896	75888	75888	I	2813	’ ‘
75930	75936	75924	75924	I	2813	’ His frown deepens further . ‘
75944	75955	75939	75939	you	2813	’ I sigh and reach up to grab his cheeks . ‘
75965	75966	75939	75939	you	2813	’ ‘
75969	75973	75981	75981	lady	2813	’ he laughs . ‘

76003	76004	75983	75983	We	1068	’ ‘

76234	76244	76245	76245	I	2813	’m not even being dramatic . I absolutely will . ‘
76278	76298	76273	76273	I	2813	’ He ’s just looking at his wife like she ’s a complete nutcase . I think she is . ‘

76625	76655	76656	76656	He	2813	‘ Yes , it does . The whole time you were running , I was so frustrated . I was thinking there must ’ve been something wrong with you . ’
76660	76672	76656	76656	He	2813	‘ You know , because you would n’t submit to me . ’

I do n’t know where this is leading to , but I already know that he left me because he knew he was in trouble , because he did n’t want to hurt me . I do n’t need to hear it all again . He has a little nibble of his lip , right under my nose , and then presses on . ‘
77024	77058	77059	77059	Ava	536	’ Of course I ran again . My instincts did n’t fail me . Even if I was n’t wholly sure of why I should be running , I knew I had to . ‘

Chapter 14 The familiar sound of whirring and banging wakes me , and knowing where to find him , I take myself down to the gym . I stand on the other side of the glass door and watch his sweat drenched back flexing and rippling as he pounds the treadmill while watching the sports news on the suspended television . Opening the door quietly , I wander in and take myself around the front of the machine , sitting my naked arse on the weights bench in front of him . He ’s running very fast , and when I lean back on my arms , he slams his fist on the slow button , and starts a steady pace down until he ’s stopped completely . My sleepy eyes are beside themselves , watching as he grabs a towel and runs it through his hair and over his face . He ’s a mass of pure , solid , shimmering sweatiness . I could eat him . I ’m
77624	77627	77628	77628	His	1082	‘ Morning . ’
77649	77660	77642	77642	he	1082	‘ Morning yourself . Why are you running in here ? ’
77673	77698	77672	77672	I	2813	’m going by the tiny , barely noticeable grin on his face , he knows I know the answer to that question , too . ‘
77704	77741	77699	77699	I	2813	’ I throw him a questioning look , but do n’t bother challenging him on it . If pregnancy stops him from dragging me out of bed at sunbreak for a trek around London , then I ’m

77814	77858	77791	77791	baby	306	’ Just as the words leave my lips , I hear the front door open and shut , and then the cheerful calling of Cathy . If Cathy ’s here , then it ’s got to be eight o’clock - ish , and I ’m

77902	77977	77899	77899	Cathy	1284	’ I do a quick scan of the gym , looking for a towel or anything to conceal my naked form so I can escape upstairs with my dignity still intact . I laugh to myself . I lost my dignity the morning Cathy walked in on us both naked . My eyes land on the towel in Jesse ’s hand , and I quickly snatch it from his grasp to flap it out . ‘
77988	78006	77899	77899	Cathy	1284	’ he muses smugly . He ’s right . It ’s little more than a face cloth . ‘
78010	78023	77899	77899	Cathy	1284	’ I lift pleading eyes to him and find a soft smile . ‘
78027	78075	78076	78076	Cathy	1284	’ He opens his arms , and I walk right into them , lifting myself up in my usual chimp - ish manner . His damp skin is slippery and smells delicious . Walking to the gym door , he opens it and sticks his head out . ‘
78078	78082	78085	78085	boy	1026	’ he calls . ‘

78099	78154	78085	78085	boy	1026	’ With that confirmation , he slips out and takes the stairs quickly . I watch over his shoulder as we rise , praying that Cathy does n’t come to investigate his questioning . She does n’t . I make it to the safety of the master - suite with my dignity still whole . ‘
78157	78172	78085	78085	boy	1026	’ he places me on my feet and drops a kiss on my forehead . ‘

78184	78197	78085	78085	boy	1026	’ I roll my eyes and point an accusing glare at him . ‘

78226	78284	78214	78214	You	1026	’ I flip the shower on and step straight into the water , not bothering to wait for it to warm . I need waking up . I make quick work of wetting my hair and slapping some shampoo in my palms . He ’s standing on the other side of the glass removing his running shoes . ‘
78291	78338	78214	78214	You	1026	’ he mumbles . I rinse my hair , condition , and then slip past him , ignoring more grumbles as he steps in . It takes me tens minute flat to dry my hair , apply my make - up and get dressed , and I ’m

78524	78546	78547	78547	Cathy	1284	’ My eyes widen , and I quickly remove myself from the barstool , looking across at Jesse ’s confused housekeeper . ‘
78559	78575	78547	78547	Cathy	1284	’ I walk out of the kitchen , leaving Jesse with his jaw slightly gaping . ‘
78578	78636	78547	78547	Cathy	1284	’ His shocked voice reaches me as I slam the penthouse door behind me . No run . I will eat . No eggs . My contentment was short lived . I stab at the elevator keypad , but it does n’t open , so I re - stab , getting myself more and more worked up . ‘
78640	78656	78657	78657	You	1284	’ I yell at the row of numbers when the door still does n’t shift . ‘
78660	78690	78691	78691	I	2813	’ I swing around and find my neurotic control freak with his hands draped loosely in his trouser pockets , watching me lose my temper with the innocent keypad . ‘

78798	78823	78797	78797	I	2813	’m as near as possible to his nauseatingly splendid face — the one I want to smash in at this particular moment in time . ‘
78828	78892	78797	78797	I	2813	’ I breathe on him before stomping off towards the stairwell , praying he has n’t took the initiative to change the code on this door yet . He has n’t . I smile smugly as I push my way through . Thirteen floors is going to kill me , but I start tackling them anyway , thanking the stair God ’s that I ’m

78937	78987	78934	78935	Fucking man	1089	’ I grumble , taking a deep breath and carrying on my way . I push my way through the fire door and walk straight into that chest , before being pushed back into the stairwell . I do n’t even try to battle free from his grasp . I ’m
78992	79007	78991	78991	I	2813	’m lifted from my feet and held in place against the concrete wall . I ’m

79084	79117	79083	79083	I	2813	’m not yielding to this . It ’s no eggs today , but it ’ll be something more extreme tomorrow . His lips form a straight line and his greens eyes narrow . ‘

This is the Jesse I know and love . I could n’t be happier . I moan , I yank at his jacket , I pull his hair and bite at his lip . ‘

80717	80754	80716	80716	I	2813	’m really not very grateful . I feel queasy , but the sweet coffee is going down a treat . I do n’t get a chance to put my phone down before it chimes again . I ’m

81052	81074	81051	81051	I	2813	’m released and my chair swivelled around to face him . He crouches in front of me and takes my hands . ‘

81204	81245	81246	81247	Good girl	566	’m willing to try because even though the thought of swallowing food makes me want to gag , I could n’t possibly feel any worse than I already do . He looks a little surprised at my lack of disobedience . ‘

81884	81934	81883	81883	I	2813	’m still at The Manor . Come ? We ’ll have steak . The last bit gets me . On my way x I pack my desk up and wave a goodbye to all of my colleagues , meeting a woman holding a bunch of flowers at the door . ‘
81938	81974	81935	81936	Ava O’Shea	536	’ she asks . It ’s not the usual florist , and she called me by my maiden name . Jesse would absolutely never do that and he already sent me flowers today , anyway . ‘
81979	82011	81935	81936	Ava O’Shea	536	’ I sound cautious which is fine because I am . I ’ve just noticed the flowers are not calla lilies and they are far from fresh . In fact , they ’re

82127	82409	82121	82121	I	2813	’ I flinch . Like what ? She carries on her way , not bothering to enlighten me , so I find the card and scramble between my full hands to remove it from the tiny envelope . HE SAYS HE NEEDS YOU . HE DOESN’T. YOU THINK YOU KNOW HIM . YOU DON’T. I DO . LEAVE HIM . Chapter 15 My heart stops beating in my chest and one name springs to mind immediately . Coral . I should feel concerned , but I do n’t . I feel deadly possessive at the suggestion . A lightning bolt of Jesse ’s famous attribute flies through me , leaving me dropping everything in my arms to the floor and tearing the malicious warning up slowly . Who the hell does she think she is ? A fuck , that ’s what she was , nothing more than a convenient fuck . Has she been in touch with Jesse again ? Should I ask him and prick his curiosity , because I do n’t want him to know about this . I do n’t want anything tipping him over the edge . I can deal with empty threats . Leave him , or what ? I stuff the dead flowers in a bin over the road , along with the card , and make my way to the car park . The desperate urge to be with him has suddenly overwhelmed me . I come to an abrupt halt when I see the parking space where I left my Mini this morning is empty . No car . I glace up at the board displaying the floor number and note that I ’m
82424	82430	82431	82431	John	2813	‘ S’all good , girl . ’

82502	82516	82493	82493	girl	87	’ I turn startled eyes back to the mountain of a black man . ‘
82523	82536	82493	82493	girl	87	’ John has a clear look of embarrassment on his mean face . ‘
82546	82556	82493	82493	girl	87	’ He nods his head to the passenger side . ‘
82563	82574	82493	82493	girl	87	’ I laugh . His eyebrows appear over his wraparounds . ‘
82580	82622	82623	82623	I	2813	’ he asks seriously . I take a deep , calming breath and make my way around to the passenger side and climb in . Yes , he needs me all right . He needs me to drive me fucking crazy ! ‘
82628	82642	82623	82623	I	2813	’ I mutter , yanking my seatbelt around and clipping it in place . ‘
82651	82673	82674	82674	John	2813	’ John commences strumming on the steering wheel as he drives out of the car park , back into the daylight . ‘
82676	82688	82674	82674	John	2813	’ I start in a matter - of - fact tone . ‘
82732	82753	82754	82754	I	2813	’ He laughs a deep , rolling belly laugh , his neck retracting and revealing those chins he keeps hidden . ‘
82762	82819	82754	82754	I	2813	’ he chuckles , reaching under his glasses and wiping under his eyes . I ’ve never seen this big , menacing beast so vivacious . It makes me smile , thoughts of challenging husbands and threatening notes soon making way for the giggles . But then John ’s face straightens all too quickly , and I ’m
82843	82856	82857	82857	His	1129	‘ He might get worse . I believe congratulations are in order . ’
82879	82885	82886	82886	I	2813	‘ He ’s told you ? ’

82915	82920	82886	82886	I	2813	‘ He did n’t ? ’
82921	82960	82961	82961	I	2813	‘ No , when I found Harrods baby department on the screen of his computer , it kind of let the cat out the bag . That and the smile on the mother fucker ’s face all day . ’

83249	83319	83248	83248	I	2813	’m smug . As I approach Jesse ’s office , the door opens and a man exits , looking tense but relieved all at once . It ’s Steve . He looks different , fully clothed and without a whip in his grasp . I halt dead in my tracks , completely shocked , mainly because he ’s in one piece . He does n’t look so cocky now . ‘
83322	83344	83345	83345	Ava	536	’ I stammer , the surprise clear in my tone . His eyes lift and he smiles , a little embarrassed . ‘

83363	83397	83362	83362	I	2813	’m not sure what to say . There are no bruises or black eyes , he ’s not limping and he does n’t look like he ’s just been offered burial or cremation . ‘
83402	83418	83419	83419	I	2813	’ I ask , when my brain fails to give me anything better to say . ‘

83505	83509	83510	83510	I	2813	’ He laughs . ‘

83527	83603	83604	83604	I	2813	’ My brain is failing me again . He looks sincere enough , but if I was a man and I had Jesse vying for my blood , I think I would face the shame of grovelling , which is no doubt what he ’s done . We would n’t be walking if he had n’t . It may have been a few weeks , but I know Jesse has been quietly boiling over this . ‘

83707	83751	83752	83752	I	2813	‘ I ’d been walking a fine line for too long , getting carried away , losing respect for the women trusting me . You actually did me a favour , but , of course , I wish I ’d never hurt you . ’

84232	84269	84162	84162	you	2813	’ he replies with absolutely no shame or further explanation . I reach forward and pick up a few pieces of paper , anything to stop myself from countering his ridiculous claim of not being unreasonable . ‘
84275	84332	84162	84162	you	2813	’ he asks . I try to prevent the slight tensing of my body , scorning myself for the immediate reaction to withdraw from his embrace so he does n’t sense it . Given his relaxed persona , I do n’t need to worry him with trivial , empty threats from his ex - scorned lover . ‘
84341	84348	84336	84336	we	1148	’ He groans but releases me . ‘

I ’ve collated them all in date order , stacked them in neat piles and secured them with elastic bands . Jesse slumps in his office chair and starts fiddling with his computer , and I watch as I finish binding the final pile of papers . He ’s guiding his mouse around , his frown a perfect line on his brow . Curious , I get up to go and see what he ’s so rapt with , although I suspect I already know . As I walk around his desk , he flicks his eyes quickly to me , and then hastily shuts his screen down . ‘
84482	84581	84336	84336	we	1148	’ He stands . I give him suspicious eyes and lean past him , turning the screen back on . It ’s as I thought ; baby paraphernalia everywhere . Multiple screens are open , and I glance across the bottom , seeing every manufacturer of baby equipment that you could possibly think of . There ’s even one page dedicated to organic nappies . I turn my face to his with a questioning look , but I ca n’t possibly be cranky with him , especially when he shrugs sheepishly and starts biting at his bottom lip . ‘
84589	84629	84336	84336	we	1148	’ He actually looks down and starts scuffing his shoes on the office carpet . I melt at his feet . I could hug him . So I do . I embrace his excitement and embrace him . Tightly . ‘

85073	85095	85072	85072	I	2813	’m also feeling … a little breathless . Just from a few whispered words and his hand on my body , I ’m
85164	85223	85163	85163	we	1159	’re walking down the corridor to the extension . He opens the door to the very last room , the one I fled from , the one I sat on my arse sketching drafts in , and the one in which I received my warning from Sarah . I do n’t particularly like this room , but as I ’m
85348	85419	85420	85420	You	1166	’m standing on a gigantic plush rug , so thick that I ca n’t see the tops of my feet . I trail my eyes across the walls , finding the paper I picked on one wall and the three remaining walls painted in a dull gold to match the bedding and curtains . It ’s almost an exact replica of my rough drawing . I turn to face Jesse . ‘
85424	85431	85432	85432	I	2813	’ He shuts the door quietly . ‘
85448	85449	85432	85432	I	2813	’ ‘
85455	85459	85432	85432	I	2813	’ I ask . ‘
85474	85496	85470	85470	you	443	’ He ’s trying to gage my reaction , looking a little cautious and maybe even a little nervous , too . ‘
85501	85512	85515	85515	ours	1168	’ He was nervous because he has just visibly relaxed . ‘
85517	85524	85525	85525	Ours	1168	’ My eyes widen a little . ‘
85527	85544	85525	85525	Ours	1168	’ What does he mean by that ? Does he want us to live here ? I ’m
85562	85585	85588	85588	you	1170	‘ No one has ever been in this room and no one ever will be . This is our room . If I ’m
85589	85603	85588	85588	you	1170	’re with me , maybe you ’ll want a sleep or some rest . ’
85604	85620	85621	85621	I	2813	‘ You mean when I have swollen ankles or exhaustion from carrying too much weight ? ’
85622	85630	85632	85633	a baby	67	’m suddenly contemplating the awful thought that we ’re
85746	85760	85761	85761	he	306	‘ I mean , if we need it , it will be here . ’
85935	85942	85943	85943	I	2813	‘ Why is that in here ? ’
85947	85956	85957	85957	He	306	‘ Because I had it put in here . ’
85978	85981	85964	85964	his	306	‘ Why ? ’
85982	85990	85991	85991	His	306	‘ I think it might … help . ’
86034	86042	86043	86043	My	2813	‘ What do we need help with ? ’
86071	86077	86078	86078	he	306	‘ You want it hard . ’
86082	86085	86078	86078	he	306	‘ and I ’m
86093	86098	86099	86099	He	306	’re carrying my baby . ’
86120	86133	86134	86134	My	2813	‘ So I thought carefully and came up with the compromise fuck . ’
86164	86173	86174	86174	I	2813	’m a little shocked by his obvious intention . ‘
86179	86195	86196	86196	You	1179	’ He reaches up and pulls at his tie before slowly unfastening his shirt buttons . ‘
86199	86255	86196	86196	You	1179	’ He leaves his shirt draping open , teasing my eyes with only a sliver of his flesh , and walks across the room , opening a cupboard door and fiddling with something . Then the whole room is swamped with a slow building hum of spiritual , tingle provoking music . I go rigid . ‘
86260	86280	86283	86283	Amber	135	’ I ask as he walks slowly back towards me , reaching my body and breathing down on me . ‘
86287	86292	86283	86283	Amber	135	’ he says gently . ‘
86302	86320	86299	86299	you	1179	’ I could n’t agree more , but my mouth refuses to speak and tell him so . ‘
86344	86352	86332	86332	I	2813	’ He pushes me back gently until I ’m
86360	86379	86380	86380	His	536	‘ It ’s not the hard you love , anyway . It ’s me taking you so unapologetically . ’
86413	86424	86425	86425	I	2813	‘ You ’ll never fuck any sense into me again ? ’
86445	86452	86437	86437	His	536	‘ Will you defy me again ? ’
86453	86456	86457	86457	I	2813	‘ Probably , ’
86460	86474	86475	86475	He	536	‘ Then I ’ve absolutely no doubt that I will , my temptress . ’
86490	86527	86528	86528	He	536	‘ If I want to fuck you hard and make you scream , then I will . If I want to make love to you , Ava , and make you purr , then I will . ’
86546	86561	86562	86562	He	536	‘ If I want to bind you on this cross , then I will . ’
86609	86625	86599	86599	he	536	‘ And you are mine , so I ’ll do what I like with you . ’
86723	86737	86745	86745	I	2813	’m bound , spread on the cross and at his mercy . But I ’m
86746	86753	86758	86758	baby	306	’m one hundred per cent comfortable . ‘
86760	86774	86758	86758	baby	306	’ he whispers , stroking my cheek . My heavy lids lift and I ’m
86784	86794	86758	86758	baby	306	‘ Tell me you ’ve never done this before . ’
86881	86884	86864	86864	he	1184	‘ Never . ’
86964	87033	86963	86963	I	2813	’m glass , and I have no physical hold of him . His mouth is giving me everything I need . I have no desire to demand harsher contact . This is just perfect . Trailing his mouth to my ear , he runs his tongue up the edge of my lobe , my cheek pushing into his jaw , his light stubble comforting and so familiar . I ’m
87063	87068	87059	87059	he	1184	‘ Eyes , baby . ’
87145	87193	87144	87144	I	2813	’m quickly distracted from my need to lay my hands on him when his belt is unfastened , along with his button and zipper , and he ’s pushing his trousers down his robust thighs . He ’s standing before me , uncovered and unforgivingly phenomenal . I ’m
87200	87244	87199	87199	I	2813	’m fighting the instinct to wrestle with my restraints and shout a demand for contact . He must catch my pending loss of control because he ’s pressed up to my body in a split second and looking down into my desperate eyes . ‘
87257	87280	87281	87281	I	2813	’ I try , but with his naked muscles spread all over my restrained frame , it ’s just way too hard . ‘
87285	87291	87281	87281	I	2813	’ I admit unashamedly . I ’m
87296	87561	87295	87295	I	2813	’m consumed . I close my eyes again , willing some strength from my weakness to obey him . My hands are suddenly warm , and I realise that his palms are encasing the fists I have formed . I flex them silently , showing my cooperation , and he releases me before lightly dragging his fingers up the insides of my arms , a flurry of goose bumps tracking their path until he ’s on my chest and cupping both of my breasts . My eyes are still closed , but I know his mouth is moving in . I can feel his breath spreading further over my skin the closer he ’s getting . And then there is the unmistakable heat of his mouth completely closed around my right breast . His tactic is exact . He sucks deeply , rolls his tongue slowly and pulls back to kiss my nipple sweetly before repeating , sucking , rolling and kissing . My head falls back , and I moan , a low , raspy noise of surrender . I soak up the attentive motions , as I quietly sigh and let my head go completely limp . A buzzing has developed between my thighs and is beating a steady , consistent thrum . I feel his teeth clamp painfully onto my nipple and my head flies up on a small cry . He does n’t release me , even though it ’s obviously painful . He just gazes up through his long lashes at me struggling to deal with the pressure . I ’m
87566	87633	87565	87565	I	2813	’m not telling him to stop , so I block it out and meet his stare with my own determined one , and when he smiles a little around my breast , I know I was right to ride it out . My nipple is released and the blood rushes back in as he sucks it back to life , and I release a quiet gasp . ‘
87643	87691	87565	87565	I	2813	’ he muses , drawing my knickers down my thighs and tapping each ankle to lift . Pecking his way between my breasts , up my throat and back to my lips , he cups me delicately and then slowly pushes two fingers inside of me . I ’m
87695	87698	87699	87699	he	0	‘ Shhhh . ’
87702	87721	87699	87699	he	0	‘ Soak it up , Ava . Feel every single bit of pleasure that I bless you with . ’
87754	87799	87753	87753	they	1187	’re gone , but before I can voice a frustrated complaint , I feel the soaking wet head of his cock meet the very tip of my clit . I do n’t miss the slight , sharp intake of breath from him , but I ’m
87902	87908	87909	87909	he	0	‘ Are your arms okay ? ’
87915	87918	87909	87909	he	0	‘ Yes , ’
87919	87934	87909	87909	he	0	‘ Are you ready for me to take you , Ava ? Tell me you ’re
87937	87938	87939	87939	I	2813	’ ‘
87940	87943	87944	87944	I	2813	’m ready . ’
87945	87962	87944	87944	I	2813	’m floating away . He stoops and hovers at my entrance , then drops my lips . ‘
87971	88004	87944	87944	I	2813	’ I instantly comply , the magnetism of his own pulling me straight to where they should be . I watch him as he unhurriedly breaches my opening and slides into me . ‘
88008	88024	88025	88025	Jesus	306	’ I breath , maintaining our eye contact , refusing to break this incredible intimacy . ‘
88027	88117	88118	88118	I	2813	’ His cheeks puff slightly , he shakes his head very mildly and a shimmer of sweat materialises across his brow as he reaches down and takes the back of my thighs and lifts them to his narrow hips before drawing back and pushing forward on a low , throaty moan , dipping his head and latching onto my throat . My head naturally falls to the side , my eyes closing , as he lazily licks up the column , finishing with a tender kiss under my ear . ‘
88123	88127	88129	88129	you	306	’ he murmurs , ‘
88132	88182	88129	88129	you	306	’ His words make me swallow hard and turn into his mouth , capturing his lips and worshipping him while he truly blesses me with the consistent , calm and controlled advances of his hips . In and out . In and out . In and out . When we ’re
88194	88287	88288	88288	You	1191	’re surrounded by this calming music , we are both calm , but we are both sticky , gliding against each other ’s bodies and completely out of our mind on pleasure . Out he pulls , and in he goes again . He ’s filling me wholly and not just with each and every perfect stroke . My heart is full , too . It ’s full of fierce , powerful , undying love . He pushes forward , but this time I hear a clear , harsh pull of breath . ‘
88289	88294	88295	88295	My	2813	’re going to come . ’
88306	88310	88295	88295	My	2813	‘ Not yet . ’
88345	88372	88344	88344	I	2813	’m moving fast to where I need to be . Just looking at that face has sent the spiralling rush of pressure descending downwards and now I ’m
88468	88490	88491	88493	Jesus fucking Christ	306	’m attacked by feverish spasms . He ’s grinding firmly , retreating slowly , and flowing back in , so controlled . ‘
88495	88513	88514	88514	Jesse	306	’ he mumbles quietly , drawing back and striking precisely and expertly one last mind splitting time . ‘
88516	88569	88514	88514	Jesse	306	’ I latch onto his shoulder and bite down hard , while I ride out the violent pulsations firing off all over my body . He bucks , yells and squeezes my thighs as he comes , the feeling of his scorching essence filling me , warming me , completing me . I ’m
88649	88654	88655	88655	I	2813	‘ That was perfect . ’
88805	88812	88813	88813	he	2813	‘ Do you like our room ? ’
88826	88851	88852	88852	My	2813	‘ Are we going to have a cradle put in here ? You know , for when we bring our baby to The Manor . ’
88914	88923	88924	88924	I	2813	‘ Sarcasm does n’t suit you , lady . ’
88953	88958	88943	88943	He	2813	‘ Just a question . ’
88979	88985	88986	88986	I	2813	‘ You have a bump . ’
88997	89004	88986	88986	I	2813	‘ Do n’t be stupid ! I ’m
89008	89009	89010	89010	I	2813	’ ‘
89011	89016	89017	89017	His	2813	’m not being stupid . ’
89024	89034	89035	89035	He	2813	‘ It ’s faint , but it ’s there . ’
89052	89065	89066	89066	I	2813	‘ I know this body , and I know it ’s changing . ’
89089	89096	89083	89083	He	2813	‘ Whatever you say , Jesse . ’
89098	89137	89097	89097	I	2813	’m not arguing after that perfect moment , even if I do want to slap him for insinuating that I ’ve put on weight . He leans down again and gets his mouth up close to my abdomen . ‘
89151	89152	89142	89143	Your mother	60	’ ‘
89156	89175	89181	89181	You	1195	’ I throw my head up and lob him a mighty scowl . He ’s grinning at me . ‘
89182	89199	89181	89181	You	1195	’re not referring to our child as something disgusting that you obsess about and devour daily . ’
89200	89224	89181	89181	You	1195	‘ I obsess about you . I also devour you daily . But I ca n’t call our baby a defiant little temptress . ’
89225	89240	89181	89181	You	1195	‘ No , that would be wrong . But you could call it baby . ’
89271	89279	89249	89249	He	1197	‘ Let me call our baby peanut . ’
89280	89283	89249	89249	He	1197	‘ Never . ’
89284	89288	89249	89249	He	1197	‘ Sense fuck ? ’
89289	89293	89294	89294	I	2813	‘ Yes please . ’
89311	89330	89304	89304	He	1197	‘ Pregnancy ’s making you a monster . Come on . My wife and peanut must be hungry . ’
89331	89340	89345	89345	he	1197	‘ Your wife and baby are very hungry . ’
89422	89425	89426	89426	I	2813	‘ Belt ? ’
89478	89480	89455	89455	I	2813	‘ You ’re
89483	89484	89486	89486	I	2813	’ ‘
89487	89490	89491	89491	He	1197	’m not . ’
89497	89500	89491	89491	He	1197	‘ If you ’re
89511	89554	89561	89561	Lord	1198	’ I ignore his insolence , instead pushing him down so he ’s sitting on the end of the bed . I kneel in front of him , resting my bum on my heels and start putting his socks on for him . ‘
89563	89584	89561	89561	Lord	1198	’ I yank at a few of the dark blonde hairs at the bottom of his shins . He jerks . ‘
89587	89596	89561	89561	Lord	1198	’ he reaches down and rubs his shin . ‘
89604	89605	89561	89561	Lord	1198	’ ‘
89611	89653	89561	89561	Lord	1198	’ I retort dryly , placing his shoes at his feet before pushing myself up . He slips his feet in and stands , grabbing his jacket and stuffing his tie in the pocket , all the time frowning at me . ‘
89660	89677	89561	89561	Lord	1198	’ I smile sweetly , prompting his frown to iron out and his lips to twitch . ‘
89680	89705	89713	89713	Mario	53	’ I ask . He shakes his head and takes my hand , leading me from our room and down to the bar . I ’m
89721	89725	89713	89713	Mario	53	‘ Mrs Ward ! ’
89740	89747	89737	89737	I	2813	‘ Mario , it ’s Ava . ’
89753	89758	89748	89748	I	2813	‘ How are you ? ’
89759	89762	89763	89763	He	53	‘ Ah ! ’
89775	89777	89763	89763	He	53	‘ I ’m
89786	89787	89783	89783	you	1199	’ ‘
89791	89796	89783	89783	you	1199	’ Jesse interjects swiftly . ‘
89804	89825	89802	89802	Mario	53	’ I flip critical eyes straight to my husband , who has sat himself on the stool next to me . ‘
89835	89858	89859	89859	You	1199	’ He ’s not at all perturbed by my reproachful glare . In fact , he does n’t even look at me . ‘
89864	89874	89877	89877	he	53	’re not having any . Two waters , Mario . ’
89948	89966	89970	89970	Pete	95	‘ Two steaks , Pete . One medium , one well done . No blood , whatsoever . ’
89988	90001	90002	90002	Pete	95	‘ Urhh … yes , Mr Ward . Salad and new potatoes ? ’
90025	90037	90024	90024	I	2813	’m too busy staring at my impossible husband to acknowledge him . ‘
90049	90065	90024	90024	I	2813	’ Jesse accepts the bottled water from Mario and starts pouring mine into a glass . ‘
90074	90113	90114	90114	I	2813	’ I actually choke on a cough , not that it makes a bit of difference . He ’s just looking at Pete with an expectant raised brow . Poor Pete has no idea what ’s going on . ‘
90115	90123	90114	90114	I	2813	’m not sure . Should I check ? ’
90124	90144	90114	90114	I	2813	‘ Yes , if there is , leave the salad with the well - cooked steak un - dressed . ’
90145	90151	90152	90152	Mario	53	‘ Okay , Mr Ward . ’
90162	90192	90158	90158	Pete	95	’re alone at the bar , me in a stunned silence and Jesse busying himself with water pouring duties to avoid facing his astonished wife . He knows that I ’m
90218	90229	90217	90217	I	2813	’m quietly raging . He just ca n’t help himself . ‘
90252	90269	90251	90251	I	2813	’m one step closer to moving in with my parents for the rest of this pregnancy . ’
90306	90316	90292	90292	I	2813	‘ You are not trampling my diet , Ward . ’
90317	90329	90330	90330	he	95	‘ You ’ve already got yourself pissed while you were pregnant . ’
90343	90350	90351	90351	I	2813	‘ I was mad with you . ’
90369	90382	90364	90364	His	95	‘ So you thought you would take it out on my baby ? ’
90392	90403	90383	90383	I	2813	‘ You keep saying my baby . It ’s ours . ’
90404	90411	90351	90351	I	2813	‘ That ’s what I meant ! ’
90412	90414	90383	90383	I	2813	‘ You ’re
90429	90504	90383	90383	I	2813	’ I watch him carefully , weighing up his reaction to my words . I ’ve shocked him because he ’s not coming back with a counter attack . He ’s just severely chomping on that bottom lip , his mind ’s cogs racing at a million miles per hour . He finally sags , swinging away from me on his stool , his hands diving straight into his messy array of dark blonde . ‘
90508	90513	90383	90383	I	2813	’ he curses quietly . ‘
90522	90523	90524	90524	I	2813	’ ‘
90530	90543	90528	90528	Jesse	306	’ I reinforce my threat . I need him to know that I ’m
90566	90664	90665	90665	I	2813	’m pregnant , but it was only a result of what this man does to me — what this man spikes in me . I wo n’t be getting pissed again , but a small glass of red wine wo n’t hurt and a half cooked steak is harmless . Do n’t even get me started on the eggs . I see his eyes clench shut and he takes a deep breath before turning towards my calm face . He takes my water and places it on the bar , and then holds my hands in his . ‘
90666	90669	90670	90670	I	2813	’m sorry . ’
90678	90682	90670	90670	I	2813	‘ You are ? ’
90716	90721	90708	90708	he	1207	‘ I am . I ’m
90734	90738	90739	90739	Jesse	306	’ I laugh . ‘
90800	90899	90900	90900	I	2813	’ I started on a laugh , but that little speech just ended completely seriously . I mean every word , and he knows it . His sorry eyes confirm it . I know he ca n’t help it , but he must . I need to work heavily on some reassurance , and then perhaps he might ease up . It ’s an ambitious thought when he ’s hardly learnt to control his challenging ways when it comes to only me . I let out an almighty sigh and stand up , positioning myself between his legs . ‘
90928	90949	90950	90950	Hmmm	139	’ I kiss every part of his face that I can lay my lips on , and he lets me . ‘
90961	90972	90960	90960	I	2813	’m really trying , but can we at least compromise ? ’
90973	90977	90960	90960	I	2813	‘ Compromise how ? ’
91002	91008	90999	90999	He	1211	‘ Please do n’t drink . ’
91060	91075	91076	91076	I	2813	’m carrying his baby would be way past that . It would be cruel . ‘
91080	91102	91076	91076	I	2813	’ I agree , and the relieved look that washes over his face makes me feel awful . Really really awful . ‘
91112	91131	91076	91076	I	2813	’ I peck his lips and pull out of his hold , placing myself back on my stool . ‘
91142	91239	91076	91076	I	2813	’ I nod past him . He gives my cheek a quick stroke and leaves me at the bar to go and fulfil his obligation of getting his pregnant wife a medium cooked steak . As my eyes wander around the bar , I immediately notice that it ’s busy , something I was oblivious to when Jesse brought me in here and while we were busy sniping at each other , and subsequently making friends . Did they hear anything ? Oh God , have we just revealed to a bar full of members that I ’m
91264	91285	91263	91263	I	2813	’m here is ever present . I spot Natasha in the corner with voice one and voice three , and I ’m
91330	91340	91329	91329	we	1216	’re so wrapped up in each other , whether we ’re
91355	91360	91361	91361	Drew	83	‘ Evening , Ava . ’
91374	91405	91373	91373	I	2813	’m more than thrown to find him in jeans . He has a formal shirt tucked in and his black hair is perfectly placed , as usual , but jeans ? ‘
91408	91452	91373	91373	I	2813	’ I ca n’t help my eyes making repeat up and down motions over his body , and when he shifts uncomfortably , I realise that he ’s caught me making my examinations . I quickly snap myself out of my rude observations . ‘
91457	91458	91459	91459	I	2813	’ ‘
91460	91466	91467	91467	He	83	’m good . And you ? ’
91486	91489	91467	91467	He	83	‘ Great , ’
91490	91495	91496	91496	he	83	‘ Oh , congratulations , ’
91515	91524	91525	91525	He	83	‘ Never thought I ’d see the day . ’
91530	91533	91534	91534	Mario	53	‘ Yes ! ’
91537	91541	91534	91534	Mario	53	‘ A baby ! ’
91583	91587	91572	91572	he	83	‘ Thank you , ’
91626	91635	91619	91619	He	83	‘ Just remember , none of our business . ’
91636	91639	91640	91640	I	2813	‘ What ? ’
91667	91674	91675	91675	He	83	‘ What are you talking about ? ’
91699	91704	91705	91705	I	2813	‘ What the hell ? ’
91727	91730	91731	91731	His	83	‘ Ava , ’
91778	91785	91786	91786	His	83	‘ Who else have you told ? ’
91792	91796	91797	91797	My	2813	‘ A few . ’
91801	91811	91812	91812	I	2813	‘ You ’ve told everyone , have n’t you ? ’
91828	91835	91836	91836	I	2813	’re going to be grandparents yet . ‘

91844	91876	91842	91842	Jesse	306	’ I moan , completely deflated . His adorable face takes the edge off my irritation slightly , and then he shrugs guiltily , completely diminishing the rest of my exasperation . ‘
91887	91892	91842	91842	Jesse	306	’ he asks quietly . ‘
91912	91945	91946	91946	You	1226	’ He grins at me and stoops down to seal our mouths , his hand landing on my stomach and caressing my non - bump , while his tongue caresses my mouth . ‘
91957	91958	91954	91955	Mrs Ward	72	’ ‘
91963	91974	91962	91962	I	2813	’m letting you trample all over me at the moment . ’
91975	91982	91962	91962	I	2813	‘ No , it ’s because you ’re
91991	91992	91993	91994	My Man	1227	’ ‘
91996	92023	92024	92024	I	2813	’ Sam ’s happy greeting distracts us from our moment . He claps Jesse ’s shoulder and stands me up , looking me up and down . ‘
92028	92042	92024	92024	I	2813	’ he says , staring at my tummy before lifting his sparkling blues . ‘
92052	92059	92043	92043	You	1227	’ I actually laugh , and I ’m
92079	92090	92091	92091	I	2813	‘ That ’s funny because I mostly feel like shit . ’
92094	92099	92100	92100	Jesse	306	‘ Mouth , Ava ! ’
92117	92126	92132	92132	her	2774	‘ Let ’s sit over in the corner . ’
92186	92193	92178	92178	I	2813	‘ Okay , Matthews . Spill . ’
92230	92233	92234	92234	she	2774	‘ So , ’
92246	92252	92234	92234	she	2774	‘ It ’s official then ? ’
92253	92256	92257	92257	I	2813	‘ What ? ’
92263	92267	92268	92268	she	2774	‘ The baby , ’
92274	92276	92268	92268	she	2774	‘ You ’re

92287	92305	92285	92285	Kate	2774	’ I blurt on a shocked whisper , making a quick check of the nearby tables . We ’re
92347	92359	92360	92360	I	2813	‘ Ava , I knew you ’d never see that through . ’
92361	92366	92360	92360	I	2813	’m a little speechless . ‘
92375	92376	92377	92377	You	2813	’ ‘
92384	92400	92377	92377	You	2813	’ She looks across to the men , who are all chatting at the bar . ‘
92413	92422	92423	92423	I	2813	’ she says , smiling fondly at Jesse . ‘
92434	92459	92463	92463	he	2813	’ I knew she would be . I follow her eyes and see a very happy man , but he ’s always happy when we ’re
92469	92551	92468	92468	I	2813	’m conceding to him and his impossible ways . Whichever , I ca n’t deny how happy it makes me to see him like this and to know it ’s me who does it — me and now his little peanut , too . Jesse catches my eye and flips me a wink , sending a comforting , warm shot of contentment deep into my heart , but then I remember that I have a friend with some explaining to do . ‘
92554	92561	92468	92468	I	2813	’ I blurt across the table . ‘
92569	92588	92468	92468	I	2813	’ Kate returns her body forward and gives me a tired look . I do n’t appreciate it . ‘

92604	92615	92618	92618	he	419	’ I lean forward , utterly rapt by this news . ‘
92620	92624	92618	92618	he	419	’ She shrugs . ‘

92667	92675	92663	92663	she	1235	‘ It ’s not ideal , but we ’re
92682	92683	92684	92684	You	1233	’ ‘

92704	92735	92736	92736	We	1238	’ I ask . If they are working on eradicating The Manor and all things kink from their relationship , then would n’t it make sense to avoid this place ? ‘
92737	92742	92736	92736	We	1238	’re having a drink . ’
92743	92752	92753	92753	I	2813	‘ But wo n’t you be tempted to … ’

92832	92868	92823	92823	your	1241	’ I scoff , a little offended . I am not prim . She gets her laughter under control and smiles fondly at me . I might not be delighted by her humour , but I ’m

92896	92955	92956	92956	I	2813	’ Her face is somewhere between amusement and complete seriousness — amusement because I know my mouth has just fallen open , and seriousness because I know that despite her open - mindedness and blasé approach to her relationship with Sam , she really likes him , and that has never happened . I close my gaping mouth . ‘
92957	92962	92963	92963	I	2813	’m happy for you . ’
92964	92970	92963	92963	I	2813	’m ecstatic , in fact . ‘

95524	95542	95523	95523	I	2813	’m just standing in front of him lifelessly , my arms hanging limply by my sides . I ’m

95816	95840	95809	95809	Ava	536	’ I scoff at his understatement and direct my forehead straight to his chest . I feel positively dull — dead , even . ‘

96007	96020	96021	96021	Ginger	143	’m not even being a baby . It really is that bad . ‘
96023	96038	96021	96021	Ginger	143	’ That one random word drags my splattered face from Jesse ’s wet torso . ‘

96045	96066	96043	96043	Ginger	143	’ she repeats , rootling through her bag . I look at Jesse , but he looks as equally confused . ‘
96073	96083	96084	96084	I	2813	’ She pulls out a pack of ginger biscuits . ‘
96088	96108	96084	96084	I	2813	’ She pushes Jesse from in front of me and opens the packet , presenting me with a biscuit . ‘
96123	96159	96071	96071	dear	1284	’ I wisely note that with Jesse hovering in the background and with Cathy behaving all motherly , there ’s little point in refusing , so I take the biscuit and have a little nibble . ‘
96166	96183	96184	96184	I	2813	’ She gives me one of her warm smiles and cups my cheek with her hand . ‘
96185	96189	96190	96190	I	2813	’m so excited . ’
96200	96219	96220	96222	The new boy	1285	’m feeling like this , so I smile weakly and let Jesse place me gently on a barstool . ‘
96227	96236	96243	96243	he	1285	’ She hands Jesse a pile of post . ‘
96245	96268	96269	96269	He	1285	’ That makes me laugh , especially when Jesse lets out a disgusted snort and snatches the envelopes from her wrinkles fingers . ‘
96274	96288	96269	96269	He	1285	’ I confirm , suddenly finding the energy to form a whole sentence . ‘
96298	96299	96296	96296	Cathy	1284	’ ‘
96306	96325	96326	96326	He	1285	’ She gets the bagels out and holds them up , Jesse and I both nodding our acceptance . ‘

96380	96384	96385	96385	she	1284	‘ It will . ’
96397	96463	96396	96396	I	2813	’m happily chatting away to Cathy , eating my breakfast , listening to where Clive is taking her and filling her in on my recent bouts of sickness , when it strikes me that Jesse has been silent for an eternity . He also has n’t moved . And his bagel is sitting untouched in front of him . I push his plate towards him . ‘
96468	96480	96481	96481	Jesse	306	’ He does n’t move , nor does he acknowledge me . ‘
96483	96493	96494	96494	Jesse	306	’ He looks like he ’s in a trance . ‘
96500	96522	96494	96494	Jesse	306	’ He flips an envelope over and runs his eyes across it . So do I. Jesse Ward . Private and Confidential ‘
96527	96550	96494	96494	Jesse	306	’ I ask . He turns his eyes to mine . They are glazed and wary . I do n’t like it . ‘

Despite that , though , I know I need to get my arse upstairs before he asks me again . This is one of those times when I know not to argue . He ’s starting to shake and though I have no idea what about , I ’m

96782	96787	96774	96774	I	2813	‘ What is it ? ’
96802	96811	96812	96812	He	1293	‘ You were going to kill our baby ? ’
96831	96902	96830	96830	I	2813	’m free - falling into a black hole of nothing . I ca n’t face him . My eyes are burning up with hot tears as they trace every square inch of the bedroom floor at his feet . My brain has failed me , but even if it did give some inspiration and load my mouth with the right words , I would be lying and he would know . ‘
96906	96926	96830	96830	I	2813	’ he roars , and I jump , but I still ca n’t bring myself to face him . I ’m
96989	96992	96993	96993	Ava	536	’m inexcusable . ‘
96999	97058	96993	96993	Ava	536	’ Before I can even think to try and form any words , he ’s grasping the tops of my arms and bending to get his face in my line of sight . But I still evade his greens , not being able to bare facing what I know will be there . Contempt … disgust … disbelief . ‘
97066	97103	96993	96993	Ava	536	’ I shake my head faintly , like the pathetic coward I am . He deserves an explanation , but I do n’t know where to begin . My mind has completely shut down , like I ’m
97135	97167	97168	97168	I	2813	’m forced to acknowledge him . My eyes are glassy with red - hot tears , but I can see with one hundred per cent clarity the hurt on his face . ‘
97169	97172	97173	97173	I	2813	’m sorry . ’
97216	97226	97227	97227	He	306	‘ You ’ve broken my fucking heart , Ava . ’
97338	97384	97385	97385	Ava	536	’m paralysed on the spot , nothing working , except my eyes , which are releasing a relentless flow of tears . Then I hear the front door slam , and I find myself in a heap on the floor , silently sobbing to myself . ‘
97389	97404	97405	97405	Ava	536	’ Cathy ’s soft , warm voice is only just detectable through my heaving . ‘

97489	97504	97473	97473	She	1298	‘ Oh Ava , come on , dear . Tell me what ’s happened . ’
97544	97557	97558	97558	Cathy	1284	‘ Come on . Let me make you a cup of tea . ’
97590	97653	97589	97589	I	2813	’m cradled under her arm and guided down to the kitchen . She hands me a hanky from the front of her apron , then sets about making a pot of tea . I watch her in silence , except for the odd judder of breath that escapes as I try to gain control of my shaky body and erratic breathing . I ’m
97731	97737	97738	97738	she	1284	‘ You need the energy . ’
97757	97771	97772	97772	She	1284	‘ Drink up , dear . There ’s nothing tea ca n’t cure . ’
97810	97817	97809	97809	I	2813	’m left gazing blankly at nothing . ‘

Her silence and the mug of tea that I can see in my peripheral vision , hovering at her lips , only confirms my thoughts . She ’s shocked , and having heard the words aloud , so am I. And embarrassed . ‘
97928	98089	97839	97839	I	2813	’ she says simply . What else can she say ? I know what I should be saying . I should be explaining myself and the reasons , but not only do I feel like I ’ve let Jesse down and trampled all over his happiness , I feel protective of him . I do n’t want Cathy to judge him if I tell her how I ended up pregnant , which is ludicrous . It ’s the only reason I considered a termination , and the fact that I did n’t think I was ready , but the last few days have proved me wrong . Jesse has unearthed a deep feeling of hope , happiness , and love for this baby growing inside of me . A piece of me and a piece of him mixed together to form a life . Our baby . Now the thought of ridding it from my body is absolutely abhorrent . I ’m
98099	98132	98094	98094	I	2813	‘ I would never have seen it through . I soon realised I was being stupid . I was just so shocked . I do n’t know how he ’s found out . ’
98140	98154	98155	98155	Ava	536	’m wondering how he does actually know . That paper . The envelope . ‘
98170	98186	98187	98187	I	2813	’re still pregnant and that ’s all that matters . He ’ll see soon enough . ’

98267	98270	98271	98271	I	2813	‘ Oh , ’
98445	98523	98444	98444	I	2813	’m so fucking stupid . I ’ve not changed my address with the surgery . I ’ve not changed my address with anyone . All of my mail has been going to Matt ’s and clearly the fucking bastard has been opening it . He must ’ve been in his element to find this . What the hell is wrong with him , the nasty fucking lowlife ? My damn emotions are all over the place . I ’m
98527	98531	98526	98526	I	2813	’m hurt , I ’m
98569	98588	98568	98568	I	2813	’m still shaking with anger when I walk into the penthouse foyer only half an hour later . I ’m
98617	98685	98616	98616	I	2813	’m standing staring blankly at the keypad , with not the first idea of what numbers to punch in . I glance back at the door , contemplating nipping back in to ask Cathy , but I decide against it , instead bashing in the code of the fire exit door and pushing my way through . I need to burn off some of this fury before I ’m

98866	98890	98865	98865	I	2813	’m frowning . Would Jesse have told him that ? Probably . He was probably trampling at the time , stamping his ownership . ‘
98893	98934	98935	98935	I	2813	’ I stalk past him and slip my shades on before I hit the sunshine , hoping the oversized things might conceal most of my harassed face . John ’s here . He shrugs , and I shake my head . ‘

99112	99115	99116	99116	I	2813	‘ Nothing , ’
99156	99159	99160	99160	He	2813	‘ Nothing ? ’
99172	99184	99160	99160	He	2813	‘ It ’s nothing to do with that Danish mother fucker ? ’

99366	99508	99364	99364	John	2813	’ I jump in my car and dial Casey to open the gates . No code , no gate device . Anyone would think that he was trying to keep me prisoner . I leave a clearly exasperated John in the Car park of Lusso and drive myself to work . * * * The look I flash all of my work colleagues the second I walk into the office makes them cautiously put their heads back down to work . Mindless chit - chat and feigning happiness is not something I can be bothered to do today . I need to focus on getting through the day as quickly and as quietly as possible . Interacting with anyone is a risk I ca n’t take . I might explode , and then all of my fury will be wasted . I ’m
99537	99545	99536	99536	I	2813	’m going to do to Matt . I ’m

She ’s snorting and sniffling , attracting the attention of everyone , including Patrick , who has ventured from his office to see what the commotion is all about , but he retreats hastily when he spots Sal in tears . Tom and Victoria sit tapping their pens , neither one of them coming to aid me in my distress . And I am distressed . I do n’t know what to do with her , but as no one else seems to be willing , it ’s down to me to sort her out . I slide the spread sheet into my tray and stand , taking Sal ’s elbow and leading her into the toilets , where I stuff her hands full of tissue and wait silently for her to pull herself together . After a good five minutes , she finally speaks . ‘
100366	100395	100362	100362	I	2813	’ Is all she says . It makes me smile . I think every woman on the planet has said that line at some point in their life . ‘

102256	102438	102439	102439	You	1342	’m stiff as a board . Matt knows , and he has been doing a fantastic job of keeping my parents informed and up - to - date on my love life . He ’ll be like a pig in shit over this . That cooling fury has just boiled over into the realms of panic . I quickly disregard the possibility that he ’s called my mum and dad already because if he had , then Dan would know , and he would n’t be sat opposite me happily chomping his way through a tuna melt . This is bad news . I need to get to Matt before he gets to my parents . Or I could just ring my parents and tell them myself . That would be the sensible thing to do , but I want to see them with Jesse . I want to do this bit right , which is absurd , but after how they found out about Jesse and the shock of a rushed wedding , I want to make this part special . ‘
102442	102455	102439	102439	You	1342	’ Dan ’s worried tone pulls me from yet more mental meltdown . ‘

102579	102614	102578	102578	I	2813	’m already late , but I feel no sense of urgency to hurry back to the office . The only urgency I have is to resolve my little Matt issue once and for all . ‘

102627	102634	102617	102617	I	2813	’ He nods at my wrist . ‘

102797	102802	102803	102803	I	2813	‘ You , too . ’
102828	103011	103012	103012	Ava	536	’m walking on thin ice , but this really can not wait . Matt wo n’t be home , but he ’ll be at his office , and I really do n’t care where I verbally bash him . Chapter 18 But he ’s not at his office , and he has n’t been for weeks . After driving across the city in mid - afternoon traffic , I pulled up to the glass building which houses the sales centre of the firm that he works for , only to be told by the receptionist that Matt lost his job a few weeks ago . I remember him mentioning it , he ’d used it as an excuse for his shitty behaviour , but I never gave it another thought . Despite his misfortune , though , I do n’t feel pity or concern . Nothing is going to dampen down my resentment and contempt . I sit in my car and pull my phone from my bag , full of determination . I ’ll track him down . It rings once . ‘
103014	103041	103012	103012	Ava	536	’ I was expecting a voice laced with smugness and deep satisfaction , so when I hear this one , which is broken and strained , I ’m
103073	103078	103079	103079	He	1348	‘ Are you okay ? ’
103087	103096	103079	103079	He	1348	‘ Why do n’t you ask your husband ? ’
103126	103130	103120	103120	I	2813	‘ How bad ? ’
103131	103164	103079	103079	He	1348	‘ Oh , just a couple of broken ribs and a black eye . Nothing major . Your husband knows how to do a job properly , I ’ll give him that . ’
103165	103172	103120	103120	I	2813	‘ Why did you do it ? ’
103173	103242	103120	103120	I	2813	‘ Because I want everything he has with you . Or I did . Kate took great pleasure in telling me you were marrying him , and then that letter fell on my doormat . I wondered why you would be seeking an abortion if you were married , so I guessed he did n’t know . I took a chance . Why are you having an abortion ? ’
103243	103245	103280	103280	I	2813	‘ I ’m

103260	103266	103256	103256	I	2813	’ I shout defensively . I ’m
103281	103293	103294	103294	I	2813	’m not in the least bit compelled to explain myself further . ‘
103305	103306	103303	103303	Matt	264	’ ‘
103331	103336	103330	103330	I	2813	’m in right now . ’

103358	103406	103407	103407	He	1350	‘ and do n’t worry about Elizabeth and Joseph . I ’ve been given a little taste of what will happen if I share your news . Can I suggest that you get your address changed so I do n’t receive any of your shit in future ? ’
103491	103655	103490	103490	I	2813	’m not a violent person , but if Jesse wants to take his anger out on someone , then Matt would be my person of choice every time . He deserves everything he gets , and there ’s no doubt in my mind that I wo n’t be hearing from him again and neither will my parents . It ’s one more thing ticked off my list of issues . Sarah has apologised , for what it ’s worth , but she ’s gone and that ’s all that matters . Kate and Sam are together , and Kate and Dan are not . I ’ve made friends with my brother , and Matt has been trampled . That one makes me smile again . But what I really need to be doing is finding my husband and making friends with him . I chuck my phone on the passenger seat and make my way back towards the city . I feel like I ’m
103761	103772	103760	103760	I	2813	’m full of determination to eradicate this final issue . I ’m
103786	103858	103785	103785	I	2813	’m driving over London Bridge , I glance up to my rear view mirror and spot a familiar car . Jesse ’s car . He ’s dipping in and out of the traffic in his usual haphazard style , overtaking and generally causing traffic mayhem in his wake . I spend a few moments flicking my eyes between the road ahead and my rear view mirror , the potential of what I ’m
103913	103939	103912	103912	I	2813	’m not going to try and convince myself that Jesse would n’t know where Matt worked . Of course he knows where Matt worked . I ’m
103951	104066	104068	104068	him	1356	’m worried for obvious reasons , but the rage is overshadowing that right now . Following me ? This should n’t be a surprise . I need to stop being so astounded by what lengths this man goes to — the things that he does , the reactions that he has , the extreme reactions he draws from me . I know it ’s him , but that does n’t stop me taking a right , and then a right , and then a right again , bringing me back to where I started , and as I knew it would be , the DBS is still tailing me a few cars behind . I ’m

104802	104813	104791	104791	I	2813	‘ Hey , girl . Are you on hands free ? ’
104814	104819	104820	104820	I	2813	‘ No , wait . ’

104947	104950	104938	104938	I	2813	‘ Okay . ’
104951	104964	104965	104965	I	2813	‘ Good girl . Now , tell me exactly where you are . ’

105083	105086	105087	105087	I	2813	‘ Yes , ’
105090	105101	105102	105102	He	2813	‘ Now , tell me how you ’ve been today . ’
105107	105114	105102	105102	He	2813	’re having a perfectly normal conversation . ‘
105122	105127	105117	105117	I	2813	’ Of course , I ’m
105141	105191	105192	105192	He	2813	’m being chased down in a car ? What next ? An axe wielding madman ? Jesus , since I ’ve met this man I ’ve been through the wringer , but this is going into the realms of a Hollywood blockbuster . Who the hell is following me ? ‘
105201	105228	105231	105231	he	2813	’ John ’s softly spoken words that seep from the phone and seem to linger in the closed air around me , immediately pull me back . ‘
105234	105256	105231	105231	he	2813	’ I ca n’t see John , but if I could , I know I would see that illusive gold tooth . ‘
105272	105291	105231	105231	he	2813	’ He sounds like a father , and my fondness grows for the burly beast of a man . ‘
105294	105298	105231	105231	he	2813	’ I agree . ‘
105301	105303	105231	105231	he	2813	’ I ’m
105328	105331	105332	105332	John	2813	‘ Ava ? ’
105348	105353	105341	105341	I	2813	‘ Ava , girl ! ’
105354	105357	105358	105358	I	2813	‘ John ? ’
105370	105373	105376	105376	I	2813	‘ John ! ’
105377	105402	105376	105376	I	2813	’m jolted forward again , my arms instinctively locking on the wheel and sending a sharp flash of pain straight up to my shoulders . ‘
105405	105433	105434	105434	John	2813	’ I look in the rear view mirror and freeze when I see the DBS now directly behind me , but it ’s quite a way back . ‘
105436	105440	105441	105441	John	2813	’ I yell . ‘
105448	105470	105441	105441	John	2813	’ My eyes are moving constantly from the road ahead to the mirror , back and forth , and each time they ’re
105515	105518	105519	105519	I	2813	‘ No ! ’
105579	105607	105578	105578	I	2813	’m crying . My emotions are taking hold , telling me that I should be crying , that I should be frightened . And I am . I ’m
105633	105644	105632	105632	I	2813	’m suddenly travelling sideways down the carriage way . Then I ’m
105683	105692	105682	105682	I	2813	’m not sure what happens next , but I ’m
105701	105750	105700	105700	I	2813	’m dizzy , blurred images whirling past the windows . Buildings , people and cars are all spinning around me until eventually a loud crash rings through my ears , my body jolts violently and my eyes close . I do n’t know where I am . But I ’m
105754	105840	105753	105753	I	2813	’m not moving anymore . I flex my neck on a groan and open my eyes to look out of the window . The traffic has stopped . All of it . People are getting out of their cars and wandering over to me . I shuffle my legs and move my arms , quickly noting that I have feeling in all of them , before I unclip my belt and let myself out of my car . People are walking towards me , but I ’m
105845	105875	105844	105844	I	2813	’m walking towards the DBS , which is sitting a few yards away , the engine still purring . I should be running in the other direction , but I ’m
105879	105926	105878	105878	I	2813	’m running towards it . The desperate need to know who would do this has suddenly flattened my fear . Date rape , threats , and now this ? What planet if this person on ? The accumulation of incidents is now hitting me hard . I ’m
106151	106158	106159	106159	I	2813	‘ Ava ? Jesus , baby . ’
106160	106229	106230	106230	John	2813	’m pulled into his chest , one hand cradling the back of my head , the other wrapped around my waist to hold me tight . I want to hold him back , I need to hold him back , but nothing is happening when I tell it to happen . I hear Jesse ’s phone ringing and he releases my head to fish around in his pocket . ‘
106232	106274	106230	106230	John	2813	’ Being buried under Jesse ’s chin , I can hear the low rumble of John ’s pissed off voice , and I distinctly hear him asking why the fuck he has to own such a stupidly fast mother fucking car . ‘
106279	106391	106392	106392	John	2813	’ Jesse asks , kissing my head between words . This time I ca n’t hear him . All I can hear are sirens — coming from every direction are sirens . I pull out of Jesse ’s chest and find a mass of police cars and two ambulances . Just for me ? But then I notice a crumple heap of a car , and it ’s not mine . Neither is the one wrapped around a lamppost nearby . I search through the chaos of people and abandoned cars and spot my Mini crunched up against some railings that are separating the road from the pavement . I shudder . ‘
106409	106428	106433	106433	baby	306	’ Jesse hangs up and stuffs his phone back in his pocket . He pulls at my chin . ‘
106435	106443	106433	106433	baby	306	’ I gaze up at him . I ’m
106450	106456	106457	106457	He	2813	‘ Where ’s your helmet ? ’
106470	106474	106457	106457	He	2813	‘ Fucking hell . ’
106483	106492	106493	106493	He	2813	‘ Why do you refuse to play ball ? ’
106507	106528	106493	106493	He	2813	‘ I sent John to get you , Ava . Why did n’t you let him take you to work ? ’
106529	106537	106538	106538	I	2813	‘ Because I wanted to shred Matt . ’
106541	106549	106538	106538	I	2813	‘ But you beat me to it . ’
106550	106558	106493	106493	He	2813	‘ I was so angry , Ava . ’
106559	106576	106577	106577	I	2813	‘ I would never have seen it through . I would n’t have killed our baby . ’
106590	106593	106594	106594	He	2813	‘ Shhh . ’
106620	106626	106613	106613	I	2813	‘ Excuse me , sir . ’
106644	106651	106652	106652	Jesse	306	‘ Is the young lady okay ? ’
106666	106676	106652	106652	Jesse	306	‘ I do n’t know . Are you okay ? ’
106677	106679	106652	106652	Jesse	306	‘ I ’m
106682	106687	106652	106652	Jesse	306	’ I smile awkwardly . ‘
106694	106704	106652	106652	Jesse	306	’ I look across to the two wrecked cars . ‘
106712	106717	106718	106718	You	1382	’ The copper says . ‘
106737	106759	106760	106760	I	2813	’ He smiles kindly and signals over to an ambulance . I feel all dramatic and a bit of a bother . ‘
106766	106776	106777	106777	I	2813	’ Jesse growls and tosses me a fierce scowl . ‘
106778	106797	106777	106777	I	2813	’m going to take that fine in my palm and slap you all over the arse with it . ’
106798	106803	106777	106777	I	2813	‘ I am fine . ’
106868	106896	106856	106856	Jesse	306	‘ Ava , do n’t defy me on this , please . I have no problem with pinning you down in the ambulance so they can confirm you ’re
106899	106906	106908	106908	you	1384	’ His head drops back down . ‘
106919	106920	106921	106921	I	2813	’ ‘
106925	106944	106945	106945	My	2813	’ I agree quietly . I ’ll do anything he says . I free myself from his chest . ‘
106948	106949	106950	106950	I	2813	’ ‘
106955	106960	106950	106950	I	2813	’ He sprints away . ‘
106968	107038	106950	106950	I	2813	’ I call after him , but he just waves his arm over his head to acknowledge that he heard . He ’s back in seconds , and the policeman leads us to the ambulance , pushing his way through the growing crowds of pedestrians . A paramedic on the back puts his hand out to me , but I do n’t get the chance to grasp it . I ’m
107047	107051	106950	106950	I	2813	‘ Thank you , ’
107071	107090	106950	106950	I	2813	‘ Sir , while she ’s being taken care of , do you mind answering a few questions ? ’
107091	107103	107052	107052	I	2813	‘ Yes , I do . You ’ll have to wait . ’
107104	107117	107118	107119	The policeman	67	‘ Sir , I ’d like to ask you a few questions . ’
107150	107167	107144	107144	He	67	‘ My wife and child are in the back of that ambulance and the only way you ’re
107179	107182	107183	107183	He	67	’m dead . ’
107195	107201	107183	107183	He	67	‘ So fucking shoot me . ’
107309	107313	107298	107298	he	1388	‘ Baby , you ’re
107316	107321	107298	107298	he	1388	’ I glance down . ‘
107324	107436	107298	107298	he	1388	’ I ca n’t feel anything . I pull at my dress , hitching it higher , but there is no sign of any cut . Higher it goes ; still more blood but no cut . I look at Jesse in confusion , but he ’s frozen as he watches me searching for the source of the blood . His eyes lift to mine . They are wide and uneasy . It does n’t sit well . I start shaking my head as he moves forward , taking my dress up as far as it can go . There is no cut . The blood is coming from my knickers . ‘
107439	107452	107298	107298	he	1388	’ I cry out , realisation crashing into me like a tornado . ‘
107456	107479	107298	107298	he	1388	’ He yanks the hem of my dress back down and jumps up to the ambulance , engulfing me in his arms . ‘
107485	107486	107487	107487	Sir	95	’ ‘
107489	107490	107487	107487	Sir	95	’ ‘
107495	107497	107298	107298	he	1388	’ I ’m
107533	107535	107517	107517	his	95	‘ I ’m
107538	107539	107543	107543	Ava	536	’ ‘
107545	107566	107543	107543	Ava	536	’ He grabs the back of my hair and pulls me out . His eyes are a cloud of green . ‘
107573	107585	107586	107586	I	2813	’ His thumb drags under my eye , collecting some tears . ‘
107590	107884	107586	107586	I	2813	’ This is my punishment . This is my penance for having such toxic thoughts . I deserve it , but Jesse does n’t . He deserves the happiness I know this baby would ’ve given him . It ’s an extension of me , and I know that he ca n’t get enough me . I ’ve destroyed his dream . I should have seen things clearer sooner . I should have changed my address at the surgery . I should have let John take me to work . I should n’t have gone to Matt ’s office . There are so many things I have and have n’t done that could have changed how things are playing out . My shame is eating away at me and it will do for the rest of my life . It has n’t happened how I had stupidly first thought , but the end result is the same . I ’ve killed our baby . Chapter 19 The silence surrounding us is painful . The whole way in the ambulance , I sobbed and Jesse constantly told me how much he loves me . I ca n’t help but think it ’s simply because he does n’t know what else to say . There ’s no comfort or reassurance coming from those three words . He has n’t said it does n’t matter because I know it does . He has n’t said it ’s not my fault because I know it is . He has n’t said that we will be fine either , and I do n’t know if we will . Just when I was beginning to see light at the end of the never - ending tunnel of issues , we ’re
107931	108049	107930	107930	I	2813	’m not sure if we can survive this . He ’ll resent me forever . He carries me from the ambulance , rejecting the wheelchair that ’s brought out by a nurse . He silently follows the doctor down the busy corridor , all of the time looking straight ahead and flipping one word answers to anyone who asks him questions . I ca n’t feel anything except Jesse ’s thundering heartbeat under my hand , which is resting on his chest . All of my nerve endings seem to have died . I ca n’t sense a thing . After what seems like an eternity of gently bobbing up and down in Jesse ’s arms , I ’m
108113	108360	108112	108112	We	1395	’re closed in from every direction by machines and medical equipment . A nurse stays , but the ambulance men leave after giving a brief rundown on me , what has happened and the observations they have already performed on the way to the hospital . The nurse takes notes , sticks things in my ear and holds thing to my chest . She asks questions , and I answers quietly , but the whole time , I keep my eyes on Jesse , who ’s sitting in a chair with his face in his palms . The nurse pulls my reluctant eyes away from my grieving husband when she hands me a gown . She smiles . It ’s a sympathetic smile . Then she leaves the room . I just hold it for a while , until so much time has passed , I think it could be next week , or even next year . I want it to be next year . Will this crippling pain and guilt be gone by next year ? I finally slide myself to the side of the bed , my back to Jesse , and reach around to unzip my dress . In the quiet , I hear him stand , like my movements have suddenly snapped him from his nightmare and his obligatory duties have kicked in . He comes and stands in front of me , but my stinging eyes remain on the floor . ‘
108364	108377	108112	108112	We	1395	’ he says softly , taking over the removal of my dress . ‘
108386	108406	108407	108407	You	1396	’ I counter softy . I do n’t want him to do anything that he does n’t want to . ‘
108411	108421	108407	108407	You	1396	’ He pulls my dress up over my head , ‘
108435	108462	108428	108428	I	2813	’ My chin starts to tremble as I fight to restrain the persistent tears , not wanting to enflame any guilt he might be feeling himself . ‘
108466	108507	108464	108464	you	1396	’ I whisper , still keeping my welling eyes from his line of sight . It ’s an impossible task , especially when he bends and pushes his face up into my neck , forcing my face up to his . ‘
108547	108548	108549	108549	I	2813	’ ‘
108560	108575	108579	108579	you	1396	’ He pushes me down onto the bed and kneels in front of me . ‘
108590	108611	108612	108612	I	2813	’ My vision is hazy and blurred , but I can clearly see the tears trickling from his green eyes . ‘
108664	108696	108660	108660	you	1396	’ I nod through my quiet weeping , unable to form words or even say them if I could . He brushes the back of his hand roughly across his cheeks . ‘
108704	108719	108720	108720	I	2813	’re going to be okay , and then we go home to be together . ’
108724	108731	108720	108720	I	2813	‘ Tell me you love me . ’
108751	108756	108720	108720	I	2813	‘ I need you . ’
108757	108764	108765	108765	he	2813	‘ I need you , too . ’
108802	108811	108812	108812	I	2813	‘ Let me get you into this gown . ’
108813	108940	108812	108812	I	2813	’m pulled up from the bed , but he remains kneeling , and starts peeling my blood stained underwear away from my body . I ca n’t look . I clench my eyes shut and feel instead of see my knickers being slowly drawn down my thighs . The familiar feel on his fingertip tapping my ankle prompts me to step out , but all of the time , I keep my eyes clenched shut . For the briefest of moments , I know he has moved from in front of me , and then I hear a tap running before he ’s back and gently sweeping a wet cloth up the inside on my thigh . My heart constricts painfully in my chest , and I ’m
108946	108949	108950	108950	Jesse	306	‘ Arms , ’
108979	108987	108978	108978	I	2813	’m turned so he can fasten it . ‘
108992	109081	109087	109087	Ava	536	’ he orders . I shift myself back into position , just as there ’s a knock on the door . Jesse calls an okay . The same nurse has returned , but this time she has a white coated doctor with her . He shuts the door softly and nods at Jesse , who is suddenly more alert , and I know why . The doctor has a fiddle with the machine at the side of me , and then perches on the edge of the bed . ‘
109089	109093	109087	109087	Ava	536	’ he asks . ‘
109096	109122	109123	109123	I	2813	’ The one word that Jesse has threatened to spank my arse with just slips right out . He sighs but does n’t say anything . ‘
109124	109130	109123	109123	I	2813	’m okay , thank you . ’
109131	109143	109123	109123	I	2813	‘ Okay , no aches or pains , cuts or bruises ? ’
109144	109149	109150	109150	He	2813	‘ No , nothing . ’
109164	109188	109150	109150	He	2813	‘ Let ’s see what ’s going on . Would you like to pull the gown up so I can feel you tummy ? ’
109237	109243	109244	109244	he	306	‘ I might step outside . ’
109254	109260	109244	109244	he	306	‘ Do n’t you dare ! ’
109264	109272	109275	109275	he	306	‘ Do n’t you dare leave me . ’
109423	109524	109422	109422	I	2813	’m flanked on both sides , one man pushing my gown up and feeling around on my stomach , the other breathing deeply and squeezing my hand . I just rest my head back and stare up at the ceiling , wishing this could be over so Jesse can take me home and we can start painfully processing what has happened . Who was in the DBS ? This is sheading a whole new light on my blacking out episode in the bar . Surely Mikael is n’t so wrapped up in revenge that he would go to these lengths . ‘
109532	109608	109422	109422	I	2813	’ The Doctor says as his squirts some gel on my abdomen . He starts rolling the device around while he watches the screen , and the small room is instantly filled with a wishy - washy distortion of crackling and whirring . He hums and makes odd noises as he flicks switches with his spare hand and pushes the grey contraption firmly into my stomach . It does n’t hurt . Nothing hurts because I ’m

109664	109689	109645	109645	He	1408	’ I whisper . My dying heart has suddenly roused and is climbing up to my throat , set on choking me with shock . ‘
109718	109795	109645	109645	He	1408	’ I can feel Jesse ’s hands tightening around mine , slowly constricting until I hiss a little with pain . He eases off immediately and slowly raises his head until his eyes find mine . They are wide green pools of shock and his cheeks are drenched . I shake my head mildly , like out of all the horror today had brought ; it ’s this bit that I must be dreaming about . We ’re
109858	109874	109837	109837	He	294	‘ Ava ’s still pregnant ? She ’s … she ’s … there ’s … we ’re
109876	109882	109837	109837	He	294	’ The doctor laughs a little ‘
109901	109919	109920	109920	I	2813	’ Jesse turns stunned eyes to me briefly before directing them at the monitor of the machine . ‘
109937	109949	109930	109930	I	2813	’ He leans over the bed slightly , his eyes squinting . ‘
109956	109998	109950	109950	I	2813	’ It ’s hard , but I pull my eyes away from my dazed husband and take a look myself , but all I can see is a black and white jumble of fuzz . The Doctor points at the screen . ‘
110007	110025	109950	109950	I	2813	’ I frown to myself . Two heartbeats ? Jesse recoils and almost scowls at the doctor . ‘
110032	110043	110046	110047	Mr Ward	306	’ The doctor laughs and turns amused eyes onto us . ‘
110064	110095	110096	110096	I	2813	’ His mouth falls open and he starts walking backwards until the backs of his legs hit a chair and he collapses , his arse colliding loudly with the seat . ‘
110097	110104	110105	110105	he	306	’m sorry , say that again . ’
110162	110179	110151	110154	The white coated man	306	‘ Mr Ward . Let me put this into plain English , if it will help . ’
110180	110183	110184	110184	Jesse	306	‘ Please , ’
110187	110194	110184	110184	Jesse	306	‘ Your wife is expecting twins . ’
110195	110199	110200	110200	he	306	‘ Oh fuck , ’
110231	110240	110230	110230	I	2813	’m still numb and truly shocked . Twins ? ‘
110249	110253	110245	110245	I	2813	’ Yes , I ’m
110286	110288	110276	110276	I	2813	‘ I ’m
110314	110335	110297	110297	I	2813	’ He does n’t need to know that I missed a few here and there . It ’s irrelevant now . ‘
110341	110345	110336	110336	You	1418	’ he asks . ‘
110348	110349	110336	110336	You	1418	’ ‘
110355	110360	110336	110336	You	1418	’ he flips casually . ‘
110367	110893	110336	110336	You	1418	’ It ’s not ? I glance across at Jesse warily , seeing nothing but a lean physique frozen in place . He looks like he ’s been fossilised . Is he so excited now ? I do n’t know , but he had better get used to it . This is revenge at its best . He did n’t bargain on this , and if I was n’t so shell - shocked , then I think I ’d be smug . I think I would laugh in his stunned , handsome face and tell him that he asked for this . He ’s going to be a daddy , all right . My challenging , neurotic ex - playboy has a challenge on his hands , and it ’s called a hormone frenzied wife and two screaming babies . I actually smile to myself as I lie back on the pillow and drift off to a fantasy land of chaos , a place where Jesse is pulling his hair out while I look on , smiling as our two toddlers run around his ankles , vying for his attention — a fantasy land that ’s going to be all too real very soon . My Lord is going to have some stiff competition in the demanding department because one thing I wholeheartedly wish for most is that both of these babies have every irritating trait that he does . I hope they take after their father , and I hope they challenge him every day for the rest of his life . I look at his motionless frame and smile on the inside . I also hope they are just like him because he ’s beautiful and bursting at the seams with pure intense love . Love for me , and love for our babies . I ’ve just landed softly on Central Jesse Cloud Nine . * * * After being told to take it easy for a day or two and being checked for whiplash , the doctor printed off a picture and sent us on our way . We strolled out of the hospital hand in hand , with Jesse holding the little black and white scan picture gently at the corner . I guided him the whole way because he was too rapt by the photo to look where he was going . John picked us up and dropped us at Lusso , and laughed the hardest I ’d ever seen when I told him the news that we ’d just received . I told him because Jesse still was n’t talking , not even to ask John if he caught the DBS . So I did . He lost the mother fucking thing . We passed Casey , who looked a little shocked that he was n’t growled at , and I directed Jesse into the elevator and just about coaxed the new code from him . He did n’t tell me it . He just absentmindedly punched in the four digits . 3,2,1,0 I fall apart on the inside , but maintain all seriousness on the outside . We ’re
111045	111054	111055	111055	His	306	‘ Are you going to speak anytime soon ? ’
111073	111082	111055	111055	His	306	‘ I ca n’t fucking breathe , Ava . ’
111083	111085	111055	111055	His	306	‘ I ’m
111090	111131	111132	111132	I	2813	’ I admit , although clearly not as shocked as him . His lip slowly slips through his teeth which seem to clamp down severely , his cogs firing into action in his head . It makes me immediately wary . ‘
111137	111182	111132	111132	I	2813	’ he says quietly . Chapter 20 I shrink back on my stool and drop his chin , and for the millionth time in one day , I ca n’t form any words . Nothing . Absolutely zero inspiration is coming to me . I ’m
111200	111207	111196	111196	He	2813	‘ My spirited girl is speechless . ’
111268	111275	111276	111276	he	2813	‘ Have a bath with me . ’
111289	111297	111276	111276	he	2813	‘ I need to be with you . ’
111299	111370	111276	111276	he	2813	’m lifted up to his body , my arms sliding around his shoulders and my legs finding their favourite place as he walks us upstairs . It takes no thought or any mental encouragement for my lips to find his neck and kiss him . Just kiss him and smell him and feel him , all of his minty freshness and all of his hard edges comforting me deeply . I ’m
111667	111699	111666	111666	I	2813	’m real before he off loads a past of pain . My hands find their way under his t - shirt and to the hard , rippling waves of his stomach . ‘
111704	111711	111666	111666	I	2813	’ he says between our mouths . ‘
111720	111806	111666	111666	I	2813	’ His request makes me falter slightly , but when his lips press a little harder , I find my flow again . That was n’t just a plea to remove his clothes . I work fast . The urgency to get his bare skin on mine is very quickly my top priority , so I drop his mouth and pull his t - shirt up , then start on his jeans , pushing them down his legs so he can kick them off . I ’m
111848	111885	111847	111847	I	2813	’m lifted to him , my hands sliding straight into his hair and my lips falling straight to his mouth as he steps into the bath with me wrapped around him and lowers to his knees . ‘
111891	111901	111847	111847	I	2813	’ he mumbles as I settle on his thighs . ‘
111904	111945	111847	111847	I	2813	’ I press my body into his , my breasts flattening against the vast hardness of his chest , my elbows resting on his shoulders while my hands roam all over his head and my lips work relentlessly but softly . ‘
111949	111953	111847	111847	I	2813	’ he whispers . ‘
111961	111962	111959	111959	you	2813	’ ‘
111967	111983	111963	111963	You	2813	’ His fingers thread through my hair and grip before he pulls me back . I ’m
111990	112000	111963	111963	You	2813	‘ You do know that , do n’t you ? ’
112001	112011	112012	112012	He	2813	‘ You married me , of course I know . ’
112031	112042	112012	112012	He	2813	‘ Do you think this signifies my love for you ? ’
112043	112046	112047	112047	I	2813	‘ Yes , ’
112069	112087	112088	112088	He	2813	‘ Then we should get these diamonds removed and have it re - encrusted with my heart . ’
112113	112123	112097	112097	I	2813	‘ I like your heart exactly where it is . ’
112135	112147	112127	112127	I	2813	‘ I like how it swells when you look at me . ’
112148	112155	112156	112156	He	2813	‘ Just for you , baby . ’
112170	112176	112177	112177	he	2813	‘ Let me bathe you . ’
112188	112194	112177	112177	he	2813	‘ Turn around for me . ’
112287	112300	112286	112286	I	2813	’m lapping up the affection on Central Jesse Cloud Nine , and I ’m
112335	112340	112341	112341	he	2813	‘ Are you fine ? ’
112361	112363	112354	112354	I	2813	‘ I ’m
112366	112392	112393	112393	I	2813	’ I watch the water ripple , the little waves lapping around me as he moves in closer and rests his mouth at my ear . ‘
112394	112404	112405	112405	he	2813	’m a little worried about my defiant little temptress . ’
112447	112450	112440	112440	I	2813	‘ Why ? ’
112451	112465	112466	112466	He	2813	‘ Because she ’s too quiet when there ’s information to be had . ’
112479	112491	112492	112492	His	2813	‘ If you want to tell me , then you will . ’

112547	112562	112535	112535	she	3020	’ He lifts his hips into my lower back , as if demonstrating what I ’m
112570	112575	112569	112569	I	2813	’m missing , and I ’m
112580	112596	112597	112597	I	2813	‘ And secondly , she ’s not blessing me with her forceful demands for intelligence . ’
112601	112619	112624	112624	we	1440	‘ My Lord is n’t blessing me with his wide range of expert fucking ’s , so we ’re
112626	112632	112624	112624	we	1440	’ He laughs , and I ’m
112638	112665	112667	112667	she	1441	’m not facing him because if I was , I know I ’d see the sparkle in his eyes and the light fans at the corners . ‘
112677	112739	112667	112667	she	1441	’ He gives me a little tweak above my hipbone , and I perform a little jerk and a yelp before he lets me settle again . The silence settles , too . I know his mind ’s cogs are racing because I can hear them . It ’s almost like he wants me to force him into spilling , but I ’m
112745	112771	112772	112772	His	1443	’re in a silent stand - off . He eventually sighs and starts circling tiny rings with his fingertips on each side of my bellybutton . ‘
112777	112851	112852	112852	You	1444	’ He does n’t say any more than that . He just gives me his twin ’s name and says no more , and I just lie quietly on him , waiting for him to elaborate . He needs to do this in his own time and without any encouragement from me . I know that he wants me to lead on from here , but I need him to confess everything willingly . ‘
112853	112863	112864	112864	he	1443	’re doing this on purpose , are n’t you ? ’
112889	112906	112907	112907	He	1443	‘ He idolised me . He wanted to be me . I ’ll never understand it . ’
112913	112925	112912	112912	I	2813	’m suddenly moving , being turned around to face him . I ’m
112942	112957	112912	112912	I	2813	‘ I ca n’t do this on my own , baby . Help me . ’

113034	113070	113071	113071	He	1443	‘ ve just suggested that his twin brother was ugly . I did n’t mean it like that , but it would be the furthest away from Jesse . His hands caress my back gently . ‘

113086	113090	113091	113091	Jake	786	’ I ask . ‘
113131	113162	113125	113125	he	786	’ Oh ? I take back all previous thoughts because now questions are popping into my mind left , right and centre , and I ca n’t hold them back . ‘

113327	113353	113326	113326	I	2813	’m slowly working this out . I do n’t know Jesse ’s family , and I have no desire to after he told me that they ’re
113382	113419	113285	113285	him	323	‘ Jake was everything they wanted from a son . I was n’t . I tried to be . I studied , but it did n’t come as naturally to me as it did to Jake . ’
113420	113429	113509	113509	He	1450	‘ But he wanted to be like you ? ’
113430	113508	113509	113509	He	1450	‘ He wanted the small piece of freedom I gained through being considered the one with the least potential . All of their attention was focused on Jake , the genius — the one they could be proud of . Jake would go to Oxford . Jake would make his first million before he was twenty one . Jake would marry a well - bred English girl and breed well - spoken , polite , clever children . ’
113512	113547	113509	113509	He	1450	‘ Except Jake did n’t want any of that . He wanted to choose the direction of his own life and the tragic thing is , he would ’ve chosen well on his own . ’
113548	113553	113554	113554	I	2813	‘ So what happened ? ’
113555	113567	113554	113554	I	2813	’m so intrigued . He ’s really in his flow now . ‘
113586	113604	113574	113574	You	1452	’ Yes , I know , and I bet Jesse was a regular at these house parties . ‘

Two of the most important people in his life where taken prematurely from him , both involving cars , so why the hell does he drive like a complete nut - job ? I do n’t know , but all of this adds to the explanation of his over - protectiveness . ‘

117135	117166	117134	117134	I	2813	’m working him with my hand . This is n’t urgent and frenzied . This is controlled and relaxed . He can control it so much better than I can . ‘

120980	121000	120976	120978	thanks big guy	1549	’ Jesse hangs up and walks straight to the boot of the strange car , slipping the case in . ‘
121005	121025	121026	121026	I	2813	’ I ask , pointing to the DBS . He shuts the boot and clasps his stubbled chin thoughtfully . ‘

121091	121113	121055	121055	It	709	’ he answers quickly and finally , with no room for pushing on the matter , not that it stops me . ‘
121119	121137	121116	121116	Steve	134	’ I ask , and he pulls back , momentarily faltering in his purposeful stride of actions . ‘
121140	121160	121161	121161	He	134	’ He ’s lying , and I raise my eyebrows suspiciously , just so he knows that I know . ‘
121171	121198	121161	121161	He	134	’ he huffs , reaching across to belt me up . I bat his fussing hands away when he adjusts the lap belt across my tummy . ‘

121260	121366	121259	121259	I	2813	’m not going to even try and convince myself that he can stop . Double babies looks like double mollycoddling . Jesse mollycoddling . And I know damn well what Steve ’s looking into , and I also know that Steve being left intact by Jesse is a result of Steve agreeing to look into my drugging , and now the accident , too . I throw my head back against the headrest and turn a little to watch him settle in the driver ’s seat , adjusting the settings that will take him further away from the wheel so his long legs are comfortable . ‘
121376	121403	121404	121404	You	1558	’ I ask , nodding across to my shiny snowball . He freezes mid - adjust and looks at me out the corner of his eye . ‘

121425	121453	121404	121404	You	1558	’ I should throw a hissy fit and make him drive the damn tank . I would n’t be surprised if it was bullet proof as well . ‘
121465	121483	121460	121460	I	2813	’ He brushes me off and starts the engine , revving it loudly on a satisfied smile . ‘
121488	121523	121460	121460	I	2813	’ he sighs , whacking it into gear and pulling off . I begrudgingly admire the guttural roar of the DBS as I keep my relaxed head facing him , admiring his stunning profile . ‘
121532	121543	121544	121544	I	2813	’ I ask , retrieving my phone from my bag . ‘
121552	121573	121544	121544	I	2813	’ I roll my eyes dramatically . I know he would rather boil his head than see my mum willingly . ‘

Perhaps he ca n’t cope with his ridiculous over - protectiveness either and has come to the conclusion that my parents looking after me throughout this pregnancy will probably prevent the heart attack that he ’s bound to have . It might also save our marriage because I can see quite a few months of controlling on his part and defiance on mine , that is until I ’m
121980	122024	121979	121979	I	2813	’m going to be like a whale . Huge . Enormous . Fat and pregnant and really un - sexy . I could cry . I feel his hand slide across my neck and grasp my nape , turning my face towards his . ‘

122072	122093	122094	122094	He	1570	’m joking . Anyone would have to slice their way through me to get to you . You know that . ’
122113	122135	122136	122136	Ava	536	’m being completely unreasonable , I know that . He would never leave me . What ’s the matter with me ? ‘

123941	123948	123949	123949	He	2779	‘ Ava , how are you ? ’
123973	123982	123949	123949	He	2779	‘ Is she keeping you on your toes ? ’

124127	124142	124113	124113	We	1613	’ Dad grunts his agreement , no doubt looking forward to a few pints . ‘

124156	124173	124113	124113	We	1613	’ Jesse places his hand on my knee and squeezes . Yes , perfect . Chapter 22 ‘

124201	124239	124199	124199	Jesse	306	’ My dad walks ahead , leading us to a table by the fireplace , which is lit with an array of candles , rather than the usual logs and flames that crackle during the winter months . ‘
124242	124300	124301	124301	I	2813	’ Jesse asks , pulling out a chair for me , but soon stopping me from resting my bum down when he notices it ’s hard wood and free of anything cushioned . Leaving me standing , he quickly swaps it for a nearby high - backed chair with arms , upholstered in a regal green velvet . ‘
124309	124324	124301	124301	I	2813	’ Mum perches neatly down and takes her glasses out to read the menu . ‘

124361	124382	124340	124342	my beautiful girl	0	’ I place my order with absolutely no thought , until my mum ’s head flies up from the menu . ‘
124386	124421	124472	124472	she	1617	’ Her face is shocked as she looks over her glasses at me . I shift on my seat and feel Jesse fidgeting behind me as he tucks me in closer to the table . ‘
124431	124442	124472	124472	she	1617	’ I flip casually , picking up a menu . I ’m

124600	124609	124610	124610	Mum	246	‘ Yes , he called earlier , darling . ’
124614	124647	124610	124610	Mum	246	‘ He said that you met for lunch yesterday . How lovely . I told him you were coming down before you go on holiday , but he did n’t know . I ’m

124729	124792	124728	124728	I	2813	’m saved from further interrogation when a tray is placed on the table . Everyone takes their drinks , and my parents both gasp appreciatively around the rims of their alcohol filled glasses . I look at my own clear filled highball with as much enthusiasm as I feel for it , and then at my mum ’s wineglass on a sigh . ‘
124799	124803	124804	124804	I	2813	’ Mum asks . ‘

126774	126880	126881	126881	You	1652	’ I smile , but realise instantly that I wo n’t actually have them . They live miles away from London , and with Jesse ’s family well out of the picture , there will be no calling the grandparents to pop over and relieve me for an hour . There will be no popping in to see my mum for a cup of tea and a chat so she can see her grandchildren . I feel Jesse ’s hand tighten around mine , dragging me from my unexpected , unwelcome thoughts . I look at him , and he gazes straight into my eyes . ‘
126885	126971	126883	126883	me	2813	’ he affirms , as if he ’s read my mind . He probably has . I nod , trying to convince myself that he is all I need , but with two babies to take care of and Jesse at The Manor , I can see loneliness looming — a place where adult interaction is limited because , let ’s face it , getting out and about with two babies is going to be tough and relying on visits from friends will be what I ’m

After Jesse pays the bill , we take a slow wander back to my parent ’s house , mum pointing out all of sites to Jesse as we walk and chat . When we get home , dad takes his usual seat in the window , armed with his remote control , and mum puts the kettle on . ‘
127803	127819	127822	127822	I	2813	’ she asks . Jesse looks across the kitchen to me , clocking me yawning . ‘

127942	127967	127941	127941	I	2813	’m pushed up the stairs and guided down the hallway until we reach the guest room , where he begins to strip me down . ‘

128181	128230	128178	128178	I	2813	’ He agrees , with no humour or sarcasm . He really does know , the arrogant arse . I drop his shirt and start working the button fly of his jeans before sliding my hands into the back and working them over the solidness of his arse . ‘
128235	128245	128246	128246	I	2813	’ I dig my nails in as I pass . ‘
128249	128260	128246	128246	I	2813	’ he concurs again , making me smile . When I ’m
128289	128299	128300	128300	He	2813	‘ And you know how much I love this . ’
128322	128334	128317	128317	I	2813	‘ Ava , baby , there is no way in hell I ’m
128343	128344	128317	128317	I	2813	’ ‘
128347	128351	128352	128352	I	2813	’ I pout . ‘
128357	128359	128352	128352	I	2813	’ I ’m
128384	128392	128376	128376	I	2813	‘ I do n’t think you can . ’
128435	128450	128451	128451	I	2813	‘ I think you ’ll be surprised by what I can do . Lift . ’
128456	128471	128472	128472	He	2813	‘ You mean I ’ll be surprised by what I can make you do . ’
128486	128489	128478	128478	I	2813	‘ And I ’m
128500	128651	128493	128493	I	2813	’ Of course , he ’s cocky , but one hundred per cent right , not that I ’ll tell him . I do n’t need to . It goes without saying . Instead of stroking his overinflated ego , I stoop down and kiss the top of his foot before moving my lips to his ankle , circling my tongue and kissing my way up his legs . I take my time , flattening my palms on the fronts of his thighs , just feeling him as my lips skim every naked inch of his flesh , but I soon find myself at his neck , despite my determination to drag out the whole episode . I inhale his scent and lift up on my tiptoes to reach his chin , which is higher than usual because he ’s looking up at the ceiling . I ca n’t reach . ‘
128657	128658	128659	128659	I	2813	’ ‘
128660	128666	128667	128667	His	2813	’m trying to control myself . ’
128673	128681	128667	128667	His	2813	‘ I do n’t want you to . ’
128682	128690	128691	128691	he	2813	‘ Do n’t say that , Ava . ’
128694	128702	128703	128703	I	2813	‘ I do n’t want you to . ’
128729	128741	128728	128728	I	2813	’m pushed up against the nearest wall on a growl . I ’m
128758	128763	128764	128764	You	1674	’m breathing shocked gasps . ‘
128772	128834	128764	128764	You	1674	’ he observes quietly , holding one side of my face and pushing his mouth to my ear . I close my lips , clench my eyes shut and rest my head against the wall . I need to focus because he ’s going to make this hard for me , even if he does n’t give it to me hard . ‘
128841	128860	128764	128764	You	1674	’ He unhooks my bra while keeping a hand on my cheek and his mouth at my ear . ‘
128874	128972	128764	128764	You	1674	’ Oh good Lord , my confidence is diminishing fast . Why did n’t he book a hotel , damn it . I bite painfully down on my lip , determined to keep quiet , as my lace bra is pulled away from my body and dropped to the floor before he leans down , taking my nipple in his mouth and sucking my nub gently until it ’s tingling and stiff . I hit my head against the wall , my face distorting as I try urgently to withhold a moan of pleasure . I fail . ‘
128976	128988	128764	128764	You	1674	’ I groan , banging my head against the wall again . ‘
128992	129000	128764	128764	You	1674	’ He ’s at my lips immediately . ‘
129011	129022	129009	129009	you	1676	’ I shake my head , unashamedly agreeing with him . ‘
129025	129026	129009	129009	you	1676	’ ‘
129039	129070	129009	129009	you	1676	’ He rolls his naked hips upwards , forcing me onto my tiptoes to try and escape the rub that will have me losing further control . I fail again . ‘
129073	129085	129009	129009	you	1676	’ I pant , uncontrolled and grappling at his naked shoulders . ‘
129093	129117	129091	129091	Ava	536	’ He bites my lip and keeps hold while he waits for me to give the answer — the answer we both know . ‘
129123	129154	129155	129155	I	2813	’ I confirm quietly . His eyes sparkle in approval , and I reach down to stroke him , but he pulls away from me on a mild head shake . ‘
129165	129172	129155	129155	I	2813	’ My hand is pushed away . ‘
129192	129219	129187	129187	you	1676	’ He ’s staring at me , obviously waiting for confirmation that I understand . I do , but I absolutely can not guarantee my silence . ‘
129227	129231	129225	129225	Ava	536	’ I lie . ‘
129234	129247	129225	129225	Ava	536	’ I ’ve been ambushed by him and his potency , and I ’m
129274	129313	129273	129273	I	2813	’m more desperate than ever , if that ’s at all possible . His eyes blink lazily , an almost undetectable smile flashing across his face . He reaches up and pulls my hand away from my hair . ‘
129322	129326	129273	129273	I	2813	’ he whispers . ‘
129331	129352	129355	129355	he	536	’ He backs away , and I want to yell at him , but then he picks something up and I ’m
129372	129390	129371	129371	I	2813	’m fidgeting , squirming and thinking real hard about what the hell he ’s hiding , but I ’m
129469	129481	129482	129482	He	536	‘ I think we ’ll call this one the quiet fuck . ’
129496	129502	129503	129503	he	536	‘ Keep your tongue relaxed . ’
129523	129537	129538	129538	I	2813	‘ If you feel the need to scream , bite down . Understand ? ’
129743	129753	129733	129733	He	536	‘ I think we ’ll do this lying down . ’
129865	129931	129864	129864	I	2813	’m turned onto my side slightly , my leg lifted and bent so he can straddle the one still flush with the bed . He edges forward , holding himself with one hand and keeping my leg up with the other , watching what he ’s doing , getting closer until he skims my opening . If I could , I ’d yelp , but I ’m
129959	129962	129963	129963	He	536	‘ Ava , ’
129968	129974	129975	129975	He	536	‘ Nothing can beat this . ’
130056	130086	130055	130055	I	2813	’m immobilised by pleasure , rendering me incapable of moving . He ’s right . Nothing can or ever will beat this . It ’s agonisingly good , and I ’m
130103	130111	130112	130112	he	536	‘ Do you like what you see ? ’
130120	130217	130218	130218	I	2813	’m so fixated on the movement of his muscles , I ’ve not noticed his head has now dropped and he ’s studying me . He gags me , inflicts this pleasure on me , and then expects the impossible . He wants me to reply ? I should n’t need to , he knows the answer very well , but I nod anyway . He does n’t smile or show any approval of my answer . He just gradually works his way deep inside of me , as if rewarding me for my silent response . ‘
130226	130228	130218	130218	I	2813	’ I ’m
130329	130344	130328	130328	I	2813	’m not sure would need to be raised if I was n’t pregnant . I ’m
130350	130367	130349	130349	I	2813	’m being doted upon . I can live with this for the next few months . I ’m
130390	130410	130411	130411	She	1684	’m unexpectedly overcome with heated tingles , stabbing all over my skin , but more intensely between my thighs . ‘
130416	130460	130411	130411	She	1684	’ he gasps quietly , lifting up higher on his knees , taking my lower body with him . I start shaking my head , tightening my grip of the headboard and twisting my body to try and get onto my back . I ’m
130487	130495	130496	130496	He	2813	‘ Do n’t fight me , Ava . ’
130614	130623	130624	130624	he	2813	‘ Am I making you crazy , baby ? ’
130703	130709	130710	130710	You	1685	’m still going to erupt . ‘
130711	130717	130719	130719	he	2813	’re doing well , Ava . ’
130730	130737	130723	130723	he	2813	‘ My temptress is getting stronger . ’
130792	130795	130796	130796	he	2813	‘ Ava ! ’
130800	130806	130796	130796	he	2813	‘ Shut the fuck up ! ’
130926	130948	130925	130925	I	2813	’m shaking , moaning and Jesse is still plunging into me , still solid and still biting on my ankle . I ’m
130966	130976	130965	130965	I	2813	’m immensely grateful when my leg is released and I ’m
130985	131012	130984	130984	I	2813	’m wrecked , and still relentlessly contracting around Jesse as he keeps himself buried deep and arranges my legs so he can settle between my thighs . ‘
131015	131077	131078	131078	You	1687	’ he asks , his brows raised confidently as he looks down at me . I nod , my eyes closing , no matter how desperate I am to keep them on his damp , handsome face . I also want to feel his hair out and give it a little yank , but my arms are welded to the headboard . ‘
131096	131178	131179	131179	She	1688	’ he whispers , and I flick my eyes open briefly , seeing him raising his torso so he ’s braced on two muscle swelling arms . He does n’t make any attempt to get any friction , instead seeming quietly content to just hover above me . After a few moments have passed and he ’s unmoved but still twitching within me , I force my eyes open properly . He gazing down at me , waiting for my eyes . ‘
131183	131211	131179	131179	She	1688	’ Yes , only just and she ’s still pulsating around his throbbing cock . I attempt to say something , my exhausted mind having forgotten that I ’m
131243	131303	131237	131237	His	1689	’ worth . I love it . He turns his head and kisses my palm before lowering himself onto his elbows and tucking his fingers under the scarf , pulling in down over my chin so it rests on my neck . I can talk , but funnily enough , I do n’t want to say anything now . I ’m
131321	131328	131329	131329	I	2813	’m happy to do just that . ‘
131335	131379	131380	131380	You	2813	’ he declares , but while his little proclamation is sweet , it ’s also light - years away from the usual kiss me demand . That is probably why my brow is completely furrowed and Jesse ’s eyes are sparkling in amusement . ‘
131383	131384	131380	131380	You	2813	’ ‘
131387	131400	131401	131401	I	2813	’ He drags his thumb across my bottom lip and watches intently . ‘

131412	131448	131449	131449	I	2813	’ Being gagged has dried my throat out , making my voice rough and low . His thumb reaches the corner of my mouth , and then sets off again , back across my lips . ‘

131469	131471	131456	131456	His	2813	‘ I ’m

131488	131523	131527	131527	his	2813	’ I raise my hips , signalling that kissing me is not the only thing I ’d like him to do . Jesse working himself up is really going to work me down . I ’m
131536	131544	131527	131527	his	2813	‘ Are you demanding , Mrs Ward ? ’
131545	131553	131575	131575	he	2813	‘ Are you denying , Mr Ward ? ’
131554	131561	131575	131575	he	2813	‘ No , but you do … ’
131562	131570	131571	131571	I	2813	‘ I know who has the power . ’
131595	131601	131594	131594	I	2813	’m so willing to give . ‘
131610	131622	131602	131602	I	2813	’ His hips swivel , sweeping through my remnants of pleasure . ‘
131629	131639	131602	131602	I	2813	’ I ask around his lush , wet mouth . ‘
131646	131658	131602	131602	I	2813	’ he confirms , nibbling his way up to my ear . ‘
131664	131700	131602	131602	I	2813	’ he murmurs , reaching down and hooking his arm under my knee . He pulls my bent leg upwards and plants his fist in the mattress so my leg is draped over his arm . ‘
131704	131710	131602	131602	I	2813	’ he sucks my earlobe . ‘
131713	131718	131602	131602	I	2813	’ he bites down . ‘
131721	131747	131748	131748	Ava	536	’ and then drags it teasingly through his teeth . I shudder as he skims across my cheek and plunges his tongue into my mouth . ‘
131750	131757	131748	131748	Ava	536	’ he finishes on a whisper . ‘
131783	131838	131781	131781	myself	2813	’ I smile around his lips and find his hair , unable to resist a playful yank as he moans and pleasures me with those damn delectable , wonderfully talented hips . Deep grinds . Firm dives . Easy retreats . I sigh , and he rumbles , low in his throat , but I ’m
131975	131982	131983	131983	he	536	‘ My heart ’s bucking wildly . ’
132010	132017	132018	132018	I	2813	‘ Fuck , that feels good . ’
132019	132082	132018	132018	I	2813	’m not joining him in his climax , but it does n’t stop me from whimpering shallowly and sucking in my own sharp breath , my thighs finding his waist and my arms moving to his shoulders to pull him down . I kiss him deeply , invading his mouth forcefully , helping him through the twitching and jerking of his body . ‘
132085	132103	132018	132018	I	2813	’ I ask around his mouth . He keeps our kiss up and bites my tongue lightly . ‘
132111	132158	132018	132018	I	2813	’ he warns seriously , rolling onto his back and lifting his arm for me to find my happy place . My fingertips find his scar and start their usual trailing from side to side as he pulls me in snuggly and breathes into my hair . ‘
132161	132162	132018	132018	I	2813	’ ‘
132170	132180	132181	132181	Ava	536	’ I grin into the side of his chest . ‘
132186	132198	132199	132199	He	536	’m going to shove a bar of soap in your mouth . ’
132203	132210	132185	132185	I	2813	‘ What time are we leaving ? ’
132211	132217	132185	132185	I	2813	‘ Seven - ish . We ’re

132266	132312	132313	132313	You	1693	’ I sulk into his chest , but that tone was final and what would be the point of complaining further , anyway ? It ’s not like it ’ll get me anywhere and not just because of the short notice and lack of availability . ‘

132481	132519	132520	132520	You	1693	’ She clasps my cheeks and kisses me . I should n’t be getting the credit for this . If it was n’t for Jesse , who knows how long I would ’ve put this trip off . ‘
132525	132535	132520	132520	You	1693	’ I roll my eyes , but hug her . ‘

132607	132641	132642	132642	She	79	’ She ’s poking him . It ’s like the O’Shea women have a compulsion to goad Jesse Ward . Jesse strolls over , leaving my dad browsing around the fully loaned DBS . ‘

I laugh , and he slips his wayfarers on , but not before giving me a wink and a little jiggle of his shoulders . Laidback Jesse . God , I love this man . * * * Jesse takes us on an adventure around the airport , dipping and weaving past cars , taking turns in the wrong direction and generally just seeming like he has no idea where he ’s going . I watch the sign for the airport car park go sailing past my window and frown to myself . Then I look at the clock . It ’s eleven thirty and we ’re
133569	133572	133558	133558	We	1703	‘ Shit ! ’
133584	133593	133594	133594	He	2813	‘ Ava , mouth ! What ’s up ? ’

133702	133750	133751	133751	I	2813	’ I say , diving into my bag , looking in complete vain because I know it ’s not in here . I did n’t put it in here , and my rummaging slows when I realise exactly where my passport is . He ’ll go spare . ‘
133762	133788	133751	133751	I	2813	’ I tell him , mentally cursing myself for not sorting that box out yet . He reaches forward and flips the glove compartment open . ‘

134046	134102	134103	134103	Ava	536	’m not filled with any further confidence when Jesse has to dip to enter the damn thing to avoid smacking his head . I halt on the ridiculously small amount of steps that will have me boarding , and Jesse turns to see what ’s keeping me when our arms are pulled taut between us . ‘

134644	134687	134643	134643	I	2813	’m not going anywhere near the cockpit . Peering inside , I notice just a few chairs , all massive , all leather , all reclining , and just two rows of them — one of each side of the jet . I ’m

134755	134765	134754	134754	I	2813	’m too busy gathering my pathetic anxiousness to trample . ‘
134769	134815	134754	134754	I	2813	’ Jesse answers shortly , with no smile , no acknowledgment and no please . She beats a hasty retreat , and Jesse slips my ballet pumps from my feet , dropping them carelessly to the floor before getting comfy and repositioning my feet so they ’re
134825	134828	134829	134829	he	95	‘ Okay ? ’
134832	134836	134837	134837	I	2813	‘ Not really . ’

His fierceness , his protectiveness , his dominant ways . The way he walks and the way he tramples , and all of the ways in which he loves me , with unapologetic , raw adoration . The way I return that love . I shift in my seat and in my subconscious , I hear his laugh . The soft , low one . Then I feel the wet warmness of his tongue on my toe . I smile , being snapped from all of my mental assessments of my beautiful husband . I open one eye , and I ’m
135335	135338	135339	135339	he	1722	‘ Dreaming ? ’
135349	135353	135354	135354	I	2813	‘ Of you . ’
135357	135374	135375	135375	I	2813	‘ Tell me when we take off so I can put my head between my legs . ‘

I look to the side and see our waters placed on a highly polished table , and then I peek down the aisle and see the perfect woman pottering around at the other end of the jet . ‘
135509	135524	135406	135406	baby	306	’ I ask , settling back in my seat . He kisses my toe . ‘

135871	135875	135876	135876	I	2813	’m instantly free . ‘
135883	135912	135876	135876	I	2813	’ He helps me to my feet and watches as my arms raise , nearly touching the ceiling of the plane . Oh , that feels too good . ‘
135927	135931	135876	135876	I	2813	’ I ask , ‘
135958	135965	135948	135948	my	2813	’ He raises a sardonic eyebrow . ‘
135978	136009	135968	135968	I	2813	’ He stands himself and pulls my blouse down , which is riding up my navel from my stretched position . He holds it in place until I ’ve finished . ‘

136016	136131	135968	135968	I	2813	’ I yawn , as he releases the hem of my top . I know this is probably a sign of things to come over the next couple of days , but he ’d better lighten up and fast because I ’ve packed my bikinis , and I ’ll be wearing them . As we emerge into the bright sunlight , I smile , the heat hitting my face and warming me to the core . Or warming me further . I already have a lovely , peaceful warmth coursing through me , and that ’s only going to increase over the next few days . Taking the steps down to the tarmac , we ’re
136154	136157	136158	136158	I	2813	‘ Really ? ’
136161	136170	136171	136171	He	1729	‘ We could n’t have taken a taxi ? ’

136284	136298	136275	136275	Jesse	306	‘ Are you ready to be binged on for the next three days ? ’
136299	136306	136307	136307	I	2813	‘ No , take me home . ’

136603	136702	136705	136705	we	1736	’m not asleep , but my eyes come open when the road beneath the tyres becomes bumpy and the car starts jolting all over the place . I look to the road ahead and the first thing that strikes me is the appalling condition of it . There ’s rubble all over the rut riddled surface , leaving Jesse negotiating the prestigious car with care . I ’ve never known him to drive with such caution , but it ’s blatantly obvious that any faster , then he ’s likely to take out the bottom of the car . ‘
136707	136763	136768	136768	baby	306	’ I ask , searching around for any sign of something appealing . There is nothing , only derelict land , this hideous , dusty , shambles of a road and a few houses . No , not houses , shacks would be more apt . There ca n’t be any people living in them . ‘
136770	136806	136768	136768	baby	306	’ Jesse says , deadly serious . I almost laugh , but worry is preventing it . I ’ve seen paradise , in pictures mainly , and this could n’t be any further removed . I ’m
136927	136985	136926	136926	I	2813	’m starting to feel nauseous from being tossed around in this lovely car . He ’s brought me to this dump ? He has me to himself for three days and he ’s brought me here ? I would rather sleep in the car . My tranquil mind is n’t feeling so tranquil , not now that I ’m
137019	137022	137023	137023	I	2813	‘ Jesse … ’
137024	137067	137073	137073	he	1744	’m not sure what to say . He does n’t seem in the least bit perturbed by all of this , which leaves me thinking that he ’s been here before . If he has , then why would he return ? I ’m
137110	137119	137109	137109	I	2813	’m not staying here . No way . I ’m
137135	137192	137109	137109	I	2813	’re immediately closed in by darkness , a canopy of the greenest green I ’ve ever seen , draping over us and the driveway ahead . Clusters of white flowers are spotted here and there among the foliage and the most potent fragrance is seeping into the car , even with all of the windows closed . ‘
137196	137206	137134	137134	we	1746	’ I sniff deeply and exhale on a sigh . ‘
137217	137232	137236	137236	He	1744	’ Jesse breathes in deeply himself , humming in pleasure as he exhales . I ’m
137248	137333	137247	137247	I	2813	’m still concerned by our location , but then the sunlight flickers towards the end of the concealed driveway and the shards of flashing lights stabbing at us through the windscreen makes me squint , even through my shades . It ’s like a light has been abruptly switched on and all of a sudden , I ’ve been transported to … Paradise . My breath catches in my throat , and I unclip my belt to sit forward , blinking to ensure that I ’m
137375	137513	137374	137374	We	1748	’re suddenly not moving anymore , and I waste no time ejecting myself from the car , shutting the door and absorbing my new , improved surroundings . I start walking across the rumbled , cobbled driveway towards the terracotta villa up ahead , not bothering to wait for Jesse , or even to check that he ’s following . I take the steps up to the veranda that circles the entire property and turn to get the full view of the grounds . Paradise . When I think that I ’ve taken it all in , I turn my attention back to Jesse , finding him sitting on the bonnet of the DBS , legs stretch and crossed at the ankles . His arms are folded over his chest , too . And he ’s smiling . ‘
137521	137554	137555	137555	I	2813	’ he shouts over to me . My hand reaches out and pulls a stray leaf from the shrubbery hanging from some trellis on the veranda . I smell it and sigh . ‘
137556	137570	137555	137555	I	2813	’m thinking that I ’ve just officially arrived on Central Jesse Cloud Nine . ’
137571	137574	137555	137555	I	2813	‘ Where ? ’
137660	137671	137647	137647	He	2813	‘ It ’s my most favourite place in the world . ’
137710	137715	137716	137716	he	2813	‘ Are you happy ? ’
137726	137731	137725	137725	I	2813	’m delirious with delight . ‘
137734	137750	137725	137725	I	2813	’ I thread my fingers through his hair and give it my usual little tug . ‘
137758	137776	137725	137725	I	2813	’ His mouth goes to my neck and bites lightly before he disconnects me from his body . ‘
137783	137784	137785	137785	I	2813	’ ‘
137789	137816	137785	137785	I	2813	’ I say automatically , following him to the rear of the car . I‘m soon halted when he turns and flashes me a cautionary look . ‘
137824	137879	137819	137819	I	2813	’ I hold my hands up and fetch my bag from the car instead , then follow Jesse back towards the single storey villa . He drops the cases briefly while he tries at least three different keys in the lock before finally arriving at the correct one . The door opens , and I ’m
137926	137930	137931	137931	Jesse	306	‘ Wait here . ’
138145	138149	138150	138150	I	2813	‘ Oh wow , ’
138193	138211	138192	138192	I	2813	’m standing , fiddling with a cast iron gate that ’s getting between me and the beach . ‘
138214	138280	138192	138192	I	2813	’ Jesse ’s hand is suddenly on mine , and a key is inserted into the lock , opening the gate and allowing me to pass through . Ten wooden sleepers formed as steps and covered in sand and grass take me down to the beach . It ’s deserted , and as I look each way for any sign of life , I realise we ’re

Central Jesse Cloud Nine really is Paradise . * * * We spend the rest of the afternoon unpacking , taking delivery of groceries and Jesse gives me a guided tour , showing me the six en - suite bedrooms , all with doors leading to a different part of the veranda . The kitchen , which is white and modern , has wooden stained worktops and little touches like the suspended wooden grid with cast iron pans hanging over the cooking area to maintain the rustic feel of the villa . As an interior designer , I ’m
138601	138646	138600	138600	I	2813	’m sure , but I do n’t press it . He told me only that the renovations have been underway on and off for many years , so I gather he owns this place . But I did n’t have it confirmed . Now we ’re
138733	138759	138762	138762	he	306	’m desperate to ask , and he knows it , but he ’s making me suffer . Instead of volunteering the information that he knows I ’m
138816	138834	138815	138815	I	2813	’m thankful when he speaks before me , preventing me from firing off a round of questions . ‘

I grab some peppers , chorizo sausage , rice and mushrooms , along with some lamb cutlets , and transport them to the worktop before locating a chopping board and a knife . I set to work , halving the peppers and deseeding them , and then chopping the mushrooms and sausage finely and frying it all off . I boil the rice , chop some fresh bread and pan fry the lamb . And the whole time he sits and watches me busy myself , with no offer of help and no attempt to make conversation . He just quietly observes me fulfilling my obligation to feed him . I ’m

It ’s not long before he ’s back , holding a candle in one hand and a remote control in the other . He finds some matches , lights the candle and places it in the centre of the table , then pushes a few buttons on the remote control , filling the villa with a distinct male voice . I recognise it immediately . ‘

Then he should try being a bit normal himself . But do I want him to be normal ? No , I do n’t . He would n’t be Jesse if he was normal . We would n’t be us if he was normal . I take another bite of lamb to busy my mouth , instead of calling him a caveman . We ’ll never be normal , not completely , and I hope we ’re

140995	141110	140994	140994	I	2813	’m being insolent for the sake of it . I ’ll never be too tired for this man , but his sudden epiphany is really quite amusing . He should have thought about all of this before he nicked my pills . He laughs , and then the arrogant swine only leans back and pulls his t - shirt over his head , revealing himself in all of his clean cut perfection . He looks down at his chest , as if refreshing his own memory of just how incredibly flawless he is . My eyes are on that chest , too . I might even be salivating all over my lamb , but I ’m

141344	141378	141379	141379	Jesse	306	’m immobile and suddenly very concerned by this situation . I ’ve been here plenty of times before , and most of them I came out the other end a very unhappy girl . ‘
141385	141443	141379	141379	Jesse	306	’ I beg , for very little purpose . I know it will get me entirely nowhere . He ’s in a trampling mood , his sudden realisation of how he might be side - lined sparking his animal instinct to stake his claim , and probably mark me , too . He ’s like a lion . ‘
141446	141456	141457	141457	You	306	’ he asks , despite knowing damn well what . ‘

141484	141596	141483	141483	I	2813	’m so glad . I ’ll look at him this way , appreciate him this way and become consumed with desire this way for the rest of my days . And I ca n’t wait . That desire is coursing through my veins right now . It ’s always lying dormant in the background , simmering gently , ready for a few right words or a touch . Then the simmering transforms into a fizzing , deep in my tummy , and then impatience , and then torturous pleasure until explosion , whether it ’s of the soft , rollover kind , or the mind - bending , screaming kind . I ’m
141755	141769	141770	141770	Jesse	306	’m failing miserably . Used to it ? Fucking ridiculous thing to claim . ‘
141776	141792	141770	141770	Jesse	306	’ I do n’t bother wriggling because it will only tire me out , and I ’m
141804	141809	141810	141810	He	306	‘ No , Ava . ’
141834	141837	141838	141838	I	2813	‘ Please , ’

141937	141952	141936	141936	I	2813	’m beyond mystified when I do n’t get the familiar bark to open . I ’m
142007	142135	142006	142006	I	2813	’m still praying for mouth penetration . I open my eyes to be met by his stomach from where he ’s dropped a hand by my head so he ’s leaning over me . Glancing up to find his face , I know what I ’ll discover , but it does n’t stop me . I know what look I ’ll find , I know it ’ll drive me insane with lust , and I know that I ’ll be able to do fuck all about it . And there it is . My Lord , braced on one stupidly solid arm , his obscenely addictive eyes dropped low , his sickening long lashes fanning that stunning face and with a little flick of my eyes , I ’m
142170	142173	142169	142169	I	2813	’m ruined . ‘
142176	142181	142169	142169	I	2813	’ I demand calmly . ‘
142191	142201	142189	142189	Ava	536	’ he asks , clearly confident of the answer I ’m
142217	142223	142224	142224	I	2813	‘ You fucking cripple me ! ’
142231	142237	142238	142238	he	536	‘ Watch your fucking mouth , ’

142270	142289	142290	142290	He	536	‘ And you never will be . This is our normal , baby . Get used to this . ’
142346	142353	142354	142354	He	536	‘ Keep it gentle , Ava . ’

142462	142594	142461	142461	I	2813	’m beginning to get it , and he is doing a bloody fine job of showing me the way . Biting down gently mid - way up his steel length , the tell - tale signs of a regular throb , accompanied by the tensing on his legs which are securing my arms , give me all the prompt I need . My licks and strokes become more forceful , ignoring his demand to keep it gentle . He ’s going to come . I moan around him , he bucks on a round of explicit language , but then he ’s not in my mouth anymore . He ’s pushes himself up to his knees , fists his swollen cock and watches me with parted lips as he finishes . I ’m

142987	142994	142973	142973	he	306	‘ Eat your dinner , lady . ’
143015	143022	143014	143014	I	2813	’m still bubbling slightly , but I ’m
143026	143033	143034	143034	I	2813	‘ What are we doing tomorrow ? ’

147195	147198	147181	147181	I	2813	‘ Deal . ’
147241	147289	147234	147234	He	306	’m really loving it . The view is improving with each hand I win , too . Just one more , and he ’s mine , power and all . He deals again , and I sweep my cards up , quickly calculating a total of fourteen . ‘
147294	147323	147234	147234	He	306	’ I gesture for him to pass a card . A two . Total : sixteen . Crap , I really do n’t know what to do now . ‘
147329	147341	147234	147234	He	306	’ He goes to pass me another card on a smile . ‘
147350	147365	147346	147346	I	2813	’ I wave away the card , and his smile turns into a grin . ‘
147368	147403	147346	147346	I	2813	’ he asks , taking his leaning body back upright , putting way too much emphasis on that chest . I blink back my peeping eyes , determined not to lose my concentration . I ’m
147427	147431	147519	147519	he	306	‘ No , I ’m
147434	147439	147519	147519	he	306	’ I affirm snootily . ‘
147442	147456	147519	147519	he	306	’ He ’s desperately fighting a smile as he turns his cards over . ‘
147461	147465	147519	147519	he	306	’ he muses . ‘
147470	147474	147475	147475	Your	1835	’ I shrug . ‘
147478	147491	147475	147475	Your	1835	’ I do n’t reinforce his words from our trial run . I ’m

147547	147551	147552	147552	I	2813	‘ Oh dear . ’
147576	147581	147582	147582	I	2813	‘ You risked it . ’
147596	147605	147606	147606	He	306	‘ I did n’t . Lose the shorts . ’
147622	147629	147606	147606	He	306	‘ You beat me , baby . ’
147630	147636	147637	147637	I	2813	‘ I have the power . ’
147664	147672	147673	147673	I	2813	‘ How do you feel about that ? ’
147724	147733	147734	147734	he	306	‘ I ’ll ask you the same question . ’
147751	147756	147734	147734	he	306	‘ I feel powerful . ’

147827	147836	147823	147823	I	2813	‘ She ’s going to surrender the power . ’
147851	147855	147850	147850	we	1837	’re touching noses . ‘
147864	147872	147873	147873	Your	2813	’ He smiles , that glorious smile . ‘
147882	147901	147873	147873	Your	2813	’ His big hands curl around my wrists and pull my hands up to rest on his shoulders . ‘
147914	147932	147902	147903	Your God	0	’ His lips press to mine , and his tongue takes a slow sweep through my mouth . ‘
147947	147962	147934	147935	this God	0	’ He cups me over my lace knickers and rests his forehead on mine . ‘
147968	147984	147985	147985	You	2813	’ I go rigid , but bear down on his palm to get some friction . ‘
147986	147989	147990	147990	My	2813	’re perfect . ’
148004	148017	148018	148018	I	2813	’m yanking at it again . I just ca n’t help it . ‘
148021	148040	148041	148041	I	2813	’ he mumbles around my demanding lips , sliding his hands around my waist and onto my bum . ‘
148048	148062	148041	148041	I	2813	’ I could n’t stop if my life depended on it , and I ’m
148078	148085	148077	148077	I	2813	’m desperate , craving , needing . ‘
148092	148094	148106	148106	He	0	’ I ’m
148131	148142	148121	148121	He	0	‘ You know I ca n’t say no to you . ’
148143	148149	148150	148150	I	2813	‘ Yes , you can . ’
148163	148180	148162	148162	I	2813	’m stupid to remind him of this right now . He often says no , when I ’m
148190	148194	148195	148195	He	0	‘ Not now . ’
148215	148231	148214	148214	I	2813	’m too consumed , but when the cool night air attacks my bare back , I ’m
148256	148317	148255	148255	we	1839	’re going . I do n’t care . The rushing sound of the night waves gently lapping at the shore line is the first thing I hear . Then I smell the salty essence of the Mediterranean . There ’s a chill in the air , but the warmth of his body fit snuggly to mine eliminates any discomfort . I ’m
148403	148484	148402	148402	I	2813	’m fast losing my breath , my laboured breathing not helped when a gentle wave gushes up and breaks around my sprawled body , surrounding me in a shallow puddle of cool , salty sea water . My shocked , quiet yelp is n’t containable , my fingernails dig into his biceps and my back arches to try and escape the freshness , my lace covered breasts pushing into his bare chest . My burnt up state has instantly cooled . ‘
148487	148492	148402	148402	I	2813	’ he calms me , ‘
148496	148516	148521	148521	he	1840	’ His soft words relax me in an instant . I do n’t know how or even why , I ’m
148550	148555	148556	148556	he	1840	‘ I love you . ’
148559	148567	148556	148556	he	1840	‘ I fucking love love love you . ’
148572	148576	148556	148556	he	1840	‘ I know . ’
148582	148593	148556	148556	he	1840	‘ I know you do . Make love to me . ’
148613	148622	148623	148623	He	1840	‘ I never planned on doing anything else . ’
148637	148647	148623	148623	He	1840	‘ We ’ll call this one sleepy twilight sex . ’
148686	148689	148690	148690	I	2813	‘ Deal . ’
148874	148879	148880	148880	he	1840	‘ All the way ? ’
148970	149030	148969	148969	I	2813	’m on my way back down to the sand . My hands find their place on his shoulders and his forearms find their place on either side of my head . And we just look at each other . This in itself is beyond pleasurable . He ’s completely filling me , and I can feel him pulsating . I ’m
149055	149061	149085	149085	he	1840	’re both wet , but we ’re
149076	149084	149085	149085	he	1840	‘ Do you want me to move ? ’
149092	149101	149085	149085	he	1840	‘ Tell me what you want , baby . ’
149102	149110	149085	149085	he	1840	‘ Just you . However you come . ’
149111	149125	149085	149085	he	1840	‘ I come with uncontrollable love for you . Is that good enough ? ’
149157	149163	149164	149164	I	2813	‘ It ’s good enough . ’
149188	149190	149142	149142	he	1840	‘ I ’m
149193	149215	149216	149216	You	1849	’ He rocks his hips upwards , drawing a quiet intake of breath from me and strained neck muscles from him . ‘
149243	149278	149238	149238	I	2813	’ He pulls gradually out and pushes lazily back into me , pressing his lips to mine to capture my small cry of pleasure , mixed with more coldness as another wave surprises me . ‘
149290	149291	149292	149292	I	2813	’ ‘
149295	149311	149292	149292	I	2813	’ I say around his mouth , because I know that ’s his next question . ‘
149318	149319	149292	149292	I	2813	’ ‘
149327	149345	149322	149322	I	2813	’ Out and in again , and there ’s a sigh and tensing from both of us . ‘
149351	149409	149346	149346	I	2813	’ I smile , and squirm beneath him on another meticulous plunge . Our normal . I love our normal , too . Our normal is Jesse loving me so violently , it drives him crazy . It ’s me returning that love . And it ’s me accepting him in all of his challenging ways . I ’m
149415	149442	149414	149414	I	2813	’m not even feeling the coolness of the sea lapping around me now . Desire is coursing through my veins , heating my skin , and I ’m
149560	149567	149568	149568	he	2813	‘ I need to see you , ’
149571	149585	149568	149568	he	2813	‘ I need to see those eyes smoulder when you come for me . ’
149586	149589	149590	149590	I	2813	‘ Jesse , ’
149591	149672	149673	149673	She	1852	’m panting . He wo n’t have to wait very long at all . The switch is flicking , courtesy of my Lord and his expert way with me . Knowing I ’ll get chastised if I close my eyes , I work hard to resist the temptation of throwing my head back and clenching them shut . It ’s hard when he ’s doing this to me . He lifts his upper body and braces himself on his fists . ‘
149677	149682	149686	149686	Ava	536	’ he observes quietly . ‘
149694	149708	149691	149691	me	2813	’ He increases his pace , never allowing his eyes to leave mine . ‘
149715	149734	149691	149691	me	2813	’ My hands find their way to his arse and grab on hard , pushing him into me . ‘
149743	149805	149735	149735	You	1853	’ He circles firm and deep , almost purposely making this more difficult for me . I bite back a cry , mustering up all of my strength to delay the inevitable until he ’s ready . This calls for deep , controlled breaths , so I swallow hard and begin a sequence of breath regulating exercises . He knows that I ’m
149883	149901	149882	149882	I	2813	’m lying under him , soaking up his attentiveness , biting harshly on my lip , and I ’m
149917	150018	150019	150019	You	1854	’m searching for any sign that he may be close himself , and I begin to despair when I find nothing , but then his greens disappear behind his eyelids , only very briefly , and his hips jerk . He ’s struggling . Fearful that he might slow to gather himself , I quickly wrap my legs around his waist and use every leg muscle I own to push him into me . It ’s his downfall . He hisses , bucks again , and I shout my appreciation , moving my hands to his forearms and gripping hard . ‘
150024	150062	150019	150019	You	1854	’ His head flies back and his smooth pace rapidly advances into firmer strokes . I take the opportunity of his gaze away from mine to squeeze my eyes shut . I hold my breath , too . ‘
150065	150098	150102	150102	lady	2813	’ My darkness was brief . My lids are open again , and they are looking at a damp , hard face of frustration . Frustration that he ca n’t control it . ‘
150104	150108	150102	150102	lady	2813	’ he pants . ‘
150114	150115	150109	150109	You	1854	’ ‘
150118	150119	150120	150120	I	2813	’ ‘
150123	150141	150120	150120	I	2813	’ He pistons into me , yells explicitly , time and time again , and then he barks ‘
150144	150147	150102	150102	lady	2813	’ And I ’m
150182	150223	150181	150181	I	2813	’m heated completely , his cum flooding me as he stills , moaning and grinding . His breathing is sharp . My breathing is challenged . He ’s still braced on his arms and he ’s sweating profusely , while I ’m
150241	150250	150251	150251	he	1856	‘ You made me lose control , Ava . ’
150257	150268	150251	150251	he	1856	‘ Damn it , woman you fucking send me crazy . ’
150296	150300	150301	150301	You	1858	’m scorching hot . ‘
150307	150357	150295	150295	I	2813	’ I insist on a gasp . He shakes his head , like he ’s also all disorientated , before he slides from within me and falls to his forearms , taking my nipple between his lips . I barely register the heat of his mouth locked round me . ‘
150362	150383	150295	150295	I	2813	’ I sigh , finally closing my eyes for a reasonable length of time while he feasts on my breasts . ‘
150389	150390	150295	150295	I	2813	’ ‘
150396	150436	150391	150391	You	1858	’ he mumbles , latching onto the area where I know my mark to be and sucking deeply . I happily leave him to his own devices while I concentrate on stabilising my breathing and racing heartbeat , but I ’m
150441	150448	150449	150449	I	2813	‘ Take me into the water . ’
150452	150459	150460	150460	He	2813	‘ I need to cool off . ’
150474	150481	150482	150482	He	2813	‘ No can do , lady . ’
150495	150498	150482	150482	He	2813	‘ Why ? ’
150526	150533	150518	150518	His	2813	‘ It might freeze the babies . ’
150544	150549	150540	150540	I	2813	‘ It will not ! ’
150574	150582	150583	150583	I	2813	‘ How do you know for sure ? ’
150602	150627	150583	150583	I	2813	‘ Even if that were true , which it is n’t , right now my current body temperature is off the charts , so I ’m
150636	150656	150660	150660	lady	2813	’ He gasps in an obviously dramatic display of horror and jumps up , pulling me to my feet . ‘
150669	150682	150683	150683	Ouch	173	’ He throws me up onto his shoulder and slaps my arse . ‘
150685	150694	150683	150683	Ouch	173	’ I laugh , delighting in his playfulness . ‘
150705	150706	150683	150683	Ouch	173	’ ‘
150710	150722	150683	150683	Ouch	173	’ He wades in quickly , leaving me fearing the worst . ‘
150733	150746	150747	150747	He	2813	’re at risk of having a pair of well - done babies . ’
150769	150790	150768	150768	I	2813	’m held above him with my hips resting on his big palms , my hands on his shoulders , and I ’m
150805	150815	150820	150821	beautiful girl	0	’m grinning so much , my cheeks are aching . ‘
150823	150824	150825	150825	Hi	174	’ ‘
150827	150829	150831	150831	myself	2813	’ I ’m
150875	150881	150882	150882	His	2813	‘ Goodbye my beautiful girl . ’
150890	151127	150889	150889	I	2813	’m launched into the black air on a squeal , my legs and arms flailing everywhere in deranged delight . I hit the water , still screaming , but quickly get stifled by the water as I go under . The dull muffle of frantic activity in the water surrounding me is definitely not just my doing , so I kick my legs urgently and work my way to the surface , emerging on a gasp and quickly doing a three sixty turn to look for him . He ’s nowhere to be seen and apart from my fitful inhalations , it ’s deathly silent . I freeze as best I can , limiting my legs to a calm paddling beneath me . Damn it , where is he ? Silent swells of water ripple away from me , and I ca n’t work out if it ’s me causing the stir in the water , or something in the depths below — something tall , lean and beautiful , something that can hold its breath for a bloody long time . I do n’t know why , but I hold my breath , too , silently deliberating on my next move . Do I remain still and silent , or do I make a dash for the shore ? Dash , remain , dash , remain . I release the stored air from my lungs . ‘
151134	151136	150889	150889	I	2813	’ I ’m
151189	151197	151188	151188	I	2813	’m squealing like a girl , too . ‘
151201	151222	151188	151188	I	2813	’ I yelp , piercing the night time air with my filthy mouth , as my ankle is grasped and I ’m
151227	151269	151226	151226	I	2813	’m a rolling mass of wild arms and legs , probably kicking and punching him , but I ca n’t control it . It serves him right , anyway . My fright has turned into a little anger now , and I ’m
151329	151332	151333	151333	I	2813	‘ Jesse ! ’
151334	151355	151360	151360	baby	306	’m on his shoulders being carted out of the sea , his arms locked over my shins on his chest . ‘
151362	151369	151370	151370	You	306	’ He ’s not even panting . ‘
151372	151395	151370	151370	You	306	’ My hands smack his head a few times before I swoop down and grab his chin , yanking his head up . ‘
151401	151409	151370	151370	You	306	’ I spit aggressively . He laughs . ‘
151412	151413	151414	151414	You	306	’ ‘
151415	151419	151420	151420	He	306	’re a menace . ’
151441	151446	151447	151447	he	306	‘ You love me . ’
151463	151470	151452	151452	I	2813	‘ I want to kiss you . ’
151474	151480	151471	151471	I	2813	‘ I know you do . ’
151490	151504	151489	151489	I	2813	’m whipped from his shoulders and laying across his arms in a nanosecond . ‘
151510	151537	151489	151489	I	2813	’ This grin feels like a permanent fixture on my face , and his sparkling eyes are deeply set and showing no sign of fading . We ’re
151663	151815	151662	151662	I	2813	’m sure he packed because it ’s Sun - Pat . I could open my mouth when instructed so he can feed me , and I could reach over and just stroke his bare , sun kissed chest because I feel like it . I could puddle on the chair when he winks and yanks me over onto his lap to ravish me , and then continue with his breakfast with one hand while he holds me with the other , offering forkfuls of salmon to me . I could slip into my bikini within the privacy of Paradise , receiving no look of horror or demand to put something more substantial on , and go for a swim in the giant freshness of the villa ’s pool . I could be pulled out by my hand and dried off , then wrapped up and taken to the shower , where I ’m
151858	151894	151857	151857	I	2813	’m feeling a little forlorn . It ’s our last day of indulging solely in each other , with none of the distractions or issues that are all currently waiting for us in London . I ’m
151935	151973	151934	151934	I	2813	’m now prepping and preening for an afternoon down at the port and a twilight dinner . I do n’t want to go home . I want to stay in Paradise forever , just me and Jesse . ‘
151988	152050	151934	151934	I	2813	’ I look up , seeing Jesse performing the mundane task of rubbing his dirty blonde mass of wet hair with a towel , but it ’s not so mundane when Jesse is doing it . Nothing this man does is dull or ordinary . I lean back on my pillow and savour the delightful view . He ’s naked . I ’m
152053	152061	151934	151934	I	2813	‘ I need to paint my toenails . ’
152071	152088	152062	152062	I	2813	‘ It wo n’t take long , and I do n’t need to do my hands . ’
152118	152122	152131	152131	he	306	‘ Let me . ’

156688	156694	156695	156695	I	2813	‘ Kiss me , wife . ’
156696	156730	156695	156695	I	2813	’m not up for any further embarrassment , so I conform and give him exactly what he wants . This way I get to escape sooner . But then clapping starts , and I ’m
156750	156753	156754	156754	I	2813	’re staying ? ‘
156758	156790	156792	156792	twins	3535	’ He shrugs , like that explains why he has just manhandled me to the floor and demanded a declaration of love , before announcing to a bunch of strangers that we ’re
156794	156797	156798	156798	I	2813	‘ Twins ! ’
156821	156826	156827	156827	He	1924	‘ You must celebrate . ’
156856	156860	156861	156861	I	2813	‘ Thank you , ’

156949	156987	156948	156948	I	2813	’m distracted when Jesse ’s hand lands on my knee . I turn and find a face full of mischievousness . Yes , he ’s demonstrated his point loud and clear , and for everyone to see . ‘

157138	157149	157150	157150	I	2813	‘ There , the women with the pale blue cardigan . ’
157165	157170	157150	157150	I	2813	‘ Can you see ? ’
157211	157217	157218	157218	I	2813	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
157244	157247	157248	157248	He	306	‘ Jesse ? ’
157260	157263	157264	157264	Jesse	306	’m worried . ‘
157270	157315	157316	157316	We	1938	’ He shakes his head , like he ’s shaking off a concussion , and turns haunted eyes onto me . I can see that he ’s trying to look okay , but my husband is failing miserably . There ’s something seriously wrong . ‘
157317	157320	157321	157321	He	306	’re leaving . ’
157380	157387	157364	157364	He	306	‘ What is wrong with you ? ’
157475	157478	157459	157459	He	306	‘ Jesse ? ’
157527	157572	157526	157526	I	2813	’m completely bewildered , but I still manage to take her in , running my eyes up and down this stranger who has spent the best part of her time in the seafront eatery staring at me , or Jesse , or us . I ’m
157580	157615	157579	157579	I	2813	’m looking at her , the clearer it ’s all becoming . Jesse tries to reposition me to get me in the car , but I shrug him off , too intrigued by who I ’m
157619	157625	157579	157579	I	2813	‘ Ava , baby , we ’re
157628	157650	157651	157651	Jesse	306	’ He ’s not demanding or shouting at me impatiently , despite my defiance . It makes me want to cry . ‘
157655	157666	157651	157651	Jesse	306	’ The women steps forward and my fears are confirmed . ‘
157676	157681	157682	157682	Ava	536	’ Jesse says tightly . ‘
157689	157897	157682	157682	Ava	536	’ I get in . That was all the confirmation I needed . I do n’t need to hear anything else , no shouting matches or explanations . That ’s Jesse ’s mum . I shift my body in the seat and watch him make his way around the back of the car , feeling concerned when I see his mum hurry past the front to intercept him . I watch as she places a hand on his arm and he shrugs it off , I hear as she pleads for a chance to talk , and then I see as she presses her body up against the driver ’s door to prevent him from accessing the car . His hands fly to his hair and yank , the pain on his face breaking my heart . He wo n’t physically remove his mother , which leaves him out there vulnerable . I ca n’t just sit here and watch him struggle like this , so I get out and make my way around to Jesse and his mother , with nothing but determination coursing through me . I stand in front of Jesse , like a protective shield , and look her square in the eye . ‘
157901	157907	157908	157908	He	2813	’m asking you to move . ’
157913	157925	157908	157908	He	2813	‘ You should n’t be here . Why are you here ? ’
157949	157964	157939	157939	I	2813	‘ It ’s Amalie ’s wedding weekend in Seville . Why are you here ? ’
158020	158026	158027	158027	she	1947	‘ It ’s your father , ’
158030	158060	158027	158027	she	1947	‘ The wedding , it got postponed because your father had a heart attack . Amalie tried to get in touch after you never replied to her wedding invite . ’
158090	158099	158089	158089	I	2813	’m struck dumb . This is information overload . ‘
158114	158115	158116	158116	I	2813	’ ‘
158124	158129	158130	158130	I	2813	’ she replies quickly . ‘
158141	158142	158130	158130	I	2813	’ ‘
158148	158159	158144	158144	you	2813	’ he roars over my shoulder , making me wince . ‘
158186	158195	158196	158196	She	246	’m making it right all on my own ! ’
158239	158242	158243	158244	his mom	1949	‘ Twins , ’
158280	158321	158322	158322	Ava	536	’m pulled back , just avoiding a skimming of her hand on my tummy . It snaps me from my daze and makes me reassess the situation . It does n’t take long . I need to get Jesse away . ‘
158324	158333	158322	158322	Ava	536	’ His voice has softened in my ear . ‘
158342	158351	158352	158352	I	2813	’ My heart splits straight down the middle . ‘
158353	158358	158352	158352	I	2813	’m asking you nicely . ’
158374	158378	158359	158359	I	2813	‘ Please move . ’
158379	158387	158388	158388	She	3840	‘ It ’s another chance , Jesse . ’
158428	158473	158418	158418	he	306	’m not at all surprised . Those few words have only heightened my determination and turned my building tears into pure anger . I ca n’t lash out at his mother , though . I turn and slide my hand onto Jesse ’s arm . ‘
158477	158494	158496	158496	him	306	’ I say softly , tugging at his arm . He lets me take him . I ’m
158509	158548	158508	158508	I	2813	’m determined to remove my husband from this situation which is causing him anguish . I ’ve only ever seen him like this a handful of times and every one of those times has ended in heartache . I ’m
158590	158779	158589	158589	I	2813	’m more than relieved when I see Jesse ’s mum come around the front of the car because it means I can hurry around the back and jump in the driver ’s seat . The first thing I do is locate the door locks and flick the switch before I search Jesse for the keys . I ’ve never driven on the wrong side of the road before , or on the wrong side of the car , but now is not the time to get myself in a panic over something so trivial . I start the DBS up and barely look behind me as I reverse carelessly out of the space before whacking it into first and pulling away a little more cautiously . I chance a look in the rear view mirror and see a man taking Jesse ’s mum in his arms . His dad . My eyes do a quick check of the road ahead , noting the exit gates , but I do n’t have a chance to panic about finding the card that will open them . They shift automatically and I ’m
158992	159166	158991	158991	I	2813	’m going , but I just about manage to coax directions from Jesse . The familiar fragrance of Paradise finally has me relaxing completely as I make my way up the cobbled driveway to the villa . He gets out of the car and strides towards the veranda , leaving me to follow tentatively behind . I do n’t know what to do . I know we wo n’t be talking , so I need to do what instinct is telling me and that ’s to just be there for him . Not fish for information to ease my own inquisitive mind , or stamp my feet and demand answers . I already know what I need to . I know Jesse ’s parents have influenced his life too much . Now he ’s making it right all on his own , just like he said , and I need to let him do that . Following him into the villa , I find him standing in the middle of the room . I ’m
159226	159338	159225	159225	I	2813	’m just looking after him . His head is dropped , he ’s completely despondent , but he lets me undress him until he ’s standing before me naked and quiet . I go to direct him to the bed , but he stands firm and turns me back towards him , then sets about unzipping my dress and pulling it over my head , encouraging me to lift my arms . I let him do his thing , anything to drag him from his melancholy state . I stand quietly while he sees through his task , unhooking my bra before kneeling and taking my knickers down my legs . I ’m
159367	159450	159366	159366	I	2813	’m sitting on his lap , pressed against his chest . He ’s not prepared to have any space between us , which is fine by me . His arms are completely encasing me , his nose is in my hair and his heartbeat is slow and steady under my ear . This is all I can do , and if need be , I ’ll do it until the day I die . Chapter 26 I feel different this morning . I ’m
159457	159474	159456	159456	I	2813	’m not sprawled across the bed with a light breeze tickling my naked skin , and I ’m
159492	159788	159491	159491	I	2813	’m cocooned beneath Jesse , who is half laying on me , half off , so he is n’t putting pressure on my tummy . His face is nuzzled in the space between my jaw and my shoulder , his palm is flat on my abdomen and his hot , minty breath is heating my neck . Why is n’t he out running ? My rousing brain is a little confused , but not for long . It speedily kicks into gear , reminding me of the events of last night , the pain , the anguish and the shock . Paradise was turned upside down . His parents now know about me , and after Jesse ’s little trampling mission in the restaurant , they also know that he has twins on the way . My fingers slip into his hair as I gaze up at the ceiling and massage gently . I do n’t want to think about this . I do n’t want to delve deep , and I really do n’t think I need to . All I need to do is be here , listen when he wants to speak , and hold him when he needs some comfort . His pained face has brought back a whole black past of memories between us — the moment we were standing in Kate ’s lounge and he begged me not to leave him , the time I left him drunk at Lusso , and the moment I found him in his office with a whip wielding Sarah . All of those incidents lead to further excruciating pain , and I need to avoid any repeat at all costs . And I will . This man has a troubled history , but I ’m
159811	159899	159810	159810	I	2813	’m his little piece of heaven , and I ’ll never allow him to fall back into his hellish , hollow past . As I lay giving myself a little mental pep talk , I know he ’s awake . I feel the slight flicker of his long lashes against my neck , but I remain quiet , allowing him to have his thinking space , my fingers keeping up the gentle twisting of his hair and the odd massage of his head . He would know I ’m
159909	159923	159810	159810	I	2813	‘ I would never have brought you here if I ’d have known . ’
159931	159946	159924	159924	His	2813	‘ I never wanted my life with you to be stained by my past . ’
159988	159995	159996	159996	I	2813	‘ It has n’t affected us . ’
160000	160008	159996	159996	I	2813	‘ So please do n’t let it . ’
160009	160028	160029	160029	His	2813	‘ They have no place in my life , Ava . Not before , and even less now . ’
160221	160270	160215	160215	Jesse	306	’m all he needs , and I know he wholeheartedly means it . And it ’s completely understandable , given what this man has been through , not just the history of women and drink , but with his parents . That is the root cause of everything . ‘
160285	160328	160281	160281	You	1975	’ I repeat his words to enforce my own . He rolls onto his back and pulls at me , encouraging me to crawl onto his chest . I find my way and start my slow , light trailing of his scar . ‘
160335	160340	160332	160332	Carmichael	323	’ he says quietly . ‘
160353	160354	160332	160332	Carmichael	323	’ ‘
160358	160376	160355	160355	I	2813	’ I smile to myself . I was right on the money with my own private conclusion . ‘
160382	160383	160355	160355	I	2813	’ ‘
160399	160413	160414	160416	My beautiful girl	0	’ I ca n’t see him , but I know he ’s smiling . ‘
160421	160422	160414	160416	My beautiful girl	0	’ ‘
160425	160434	160436	160436	she	0	’ I ask , frowning into his chest . ‘
160444	160476	160436	160436	she	0	’ I have to agree , but I ’ve found out more since I convinced myself to keep my trap shut than I ever did when I was stamping and screaming . ‘
160498	160499	160500	160500	I	2813	’ ‘
160501	160508	160509	160509	he	2813	’m glad you ’ve said that . ’
160543	160557	160542	160542	I	2813	’m not going to like what I will hear . It ’s like I ’m
160565	160568	160569	160569	he	2813	‘ Ava ? ’
160573	160576	160569	160569	he	2813	‘ What ? ’
160577	160585	160586	160586	He	2813	‘ I need to tell you something . ’
160616	160708	160709	160709	I	2813	’m removed from his chest with minimal effort and turned onto my back . He straddles my waist , but does n’t rest himself fully on me . He chews his lip for a few moments while I look up at him , a sceptical expression plastered all over my face . I know knowledge is power is the sensible option , but given what Jesse has presented me in the knowledge department , it scares the fucking life out of me . He takes my hands and holds them tightly . ‘
160722	160723	160712	160712	Sarah	60	’ ‘
160726	160737	160738	160738	She	60	’ My head lifts and my throat is instantly hoarse . ‘
160745	160759	160744	160744	I	2813	’m gone . John ca n’t do it on his own , Ava . ’
160760	160773	160774	160774	I	2813	‘ But Sarah ? You said she was gone , end of ! ’
160775	160806	160774	160774	I	2813	’m livid . My blood is instantly boiling and it ’s heating my face , all thoughts of absconded parents and painful histories eradicated at the mention of her name . ‘
160818	160832	160814	160814	you	1982	’ I snatch my hands from his and try to push him way . ‘
160836	160837	160838	160838	Ava	536	’ ‘

160856	160888	160850	160850	I	2813	’ I spit at him . Those words just changed his concerned look to one of displeasure . He ’s scowling at me , but I could n’t give a toss . ‘
160895	160910	160850	160850	I	2813	’ He manages to seize my flailing hands and secure them above my head . ‘
160915	160922	160911	160911	You	1982	’ I yell in his face . ‘
160938	160939	160933	160933	I	2813	’ ‘

But Jesse ’s words keep running on repeat in my head . I live with Jake ’s every single day . I ca n’t do it . And I ca n’t do it to him , just because of my insecurities regarding The Manor ’s resident Indiana Jones . My anxieties are justified , but Jesse ’s guilt is n’t , and I ca n’t put him through any more than he ’s already dealt with . It would be cruel and selfish . I love him too much . He re - cups my cheeks and pierces me with green eyes full of sincerity . ‘

162775	162803	162774	162774	I	2813	’m trying to disregard the mitigating circumstances , but it ’s hard to ignore a woman who ’s attempted suicide because my husband does n’t want her . ‘

163640	163668	163639	163639	I	2813	’m lifted from my feet and sunk into the bath with him , and I do n’t help at all . I let him position me so I ’m

166230	166235	166239	166239	I	2813	’ He blushes further . ‘
166240	166247	166248	166248	He	2813	’m just digging myself a hole . ’
166252	166266	166248	166248	He	2813	‘ It ’s just nice to see a cheerful face around here again . ’

166337	166392	166336	166336	I	2813	’m going to be late . I need to be in Patrick ’s good books today . I do n’t even falter in my steps when I emerge from Lusso and see John waiting for me . He does n’t shrug apologetically like he usually would , either . I had fully expected this . ‘
166399	166416	166420	166420	girl	87	’ It ’s good to see him again . I ’ve missed the big friendly guy . ‘
166422	166457	166458	166458	You	2040	’ he rumbles , following my path around to the passenger side . I jump in and secure myself with the seatbelt , watching as John takes his seat beside me on a frown . ‘

166479	166494	166495	166495	I	2813	‘ I think I ’d be signing my own death warrant if I did . ’

166536	166547	166557	166557	girl	87	’ He looks across at me through his black wraparounds . ‘
166559	166565	166557	166557	girl	87	’ I grin at him . ‘

166656	166677	166678	166678	I	2813	‘ Yes , but now there are three of us for Jesse to get his knickers in a twist over . ’
166681	166686	166687	166687	He	2813	‘ Crazy mother fucker . ’
166695	166701	166687	166687	He	2813	‘ How are you feeling ? ’
166702	166714	166715	166715	I	2813	‘ Do you mean being pregnant , or after the accident ? ’
166742	166747	166748	166748	He	2813	‘ Both , girl . ’
166753	166770	166771	166771	I	2813	‘ Fine , on both counts , thank you . Any news on Jesse ’s car ? ’
166777	166789	166776	166776	I	2813	’m comfortable enough with John to blurt out what I want . ‘
166799	166837	166776	166776	I	2813	’ he answers coolly . I might be comfortable enough to ask , but I need to remember that John is also comfortable enough to brush me off . I wo n’t get anything out of him . ‘
166842	166853	166776	166776	I	2813	’ he asks in a blatant change of subject tactic . ‘
166858	166862	166776	166776	I	2813	’ I muse . ‘
166871	166873	166776	166776	I	2813	’ I ’m
166932	166947	166948	166948	I	2813	‘ Amalie ’s wedding got postponed because Jesse ’s dad had a heart attack , ’

166993	166999	166988	166988	he	306	‘ And what went down ? ’
167000	167005	167018	167018	John	2813	‘ What went down ? ’
167006	167017	167018	167018	John	2813	‘ Yes , did they speak ? How was Jesse ? ’
167036	167064	167031	167031	I	2813	‘ Jesse practically made a public announcement to the restaurant where we were eating . He told the bloody world that we were married and expecting twins . ’
167079	167133	167069	167069	John	2813	‘ Anyway , this woman kept staring at me and when I asked Jesse if he knew her , he went all peculiar and hauled me out of the place . His mum found us by the car , started rabbiting on about twins . You know , because Jesse was a twin . ’
167152	167157	167145	167145	he	2813	‘ Was that it ? ’
167158	167173	167145	167145	he	2813	‘ Yes , I got him away from her . He was so upset . ’
167174	167183	167145	167145	he	2813	‘ And afterwards , he did n’t drink ? ’
167184	167187	167188	167188	I	2813	‘ No , ’
167191	167207	167208	167208	I	2813	‘ But I have a feeling he would have , had I not been there . ’
167224	167230	167208	167208	I	2813	‘ Did you know them ? ’
167231	167241	167242	167242	I	2813	‘ Not really . I do n’t ask questions . ’
167243	167275	167278	167278	Sarah	60	’m nodding to myself . I know John has been around forever , and he was Carmichael ’s best friend , so he must know more than he ’s letting on . ‘
167280	167294	167278	167278	Sarah	60	’ He shifts in his seat and turns that menacing face to mine . ‘
167300	167347	167352	167352	girl	60	’ I wilt in my seat . I have nothing to say to that , so I shut up , unwrap my bagel and let John drive me the rest of the way in silence . I audibly sigh when John pulls up at the kerb . ‘
167354	167375	167352	167352	girl	60	’ I gather my bag and exit the car before I can convince John to drive me to The Manor . ‘

167393	167398	167352	167352	girl	60	’ he says slowly . ‘
167402	167417	167352	167352	girl	60	’ I think I actually blow the sarcastic sod a raspberry . Good luck ? ‘
167424	167483	167422	167422	John	2813	’ I quip , slamming the door and hearing that deep baritone laugh getting quieter as the car door comes between us . I take a deep breath of confidence and stride into my office . I‘ve never dreaded coming to work , but now I really do . Tom ’s screech is the first thing I hear . ‘
167490	167496	167488	167488	Ava	536	’ Then I hear Victoria . ‘
167506	167516	167517	167517	Ava	536	’ Then I see sparkling Sal , sparkling again . ‘
167524	167583	167517	167517	Ava	536	’ Then I clock my desk and stop dead in my tracks . Balloons … everywhere . With babies on them . There ’s a pack of nappies on my desk , too , and a How To guide on becoming a mother . But the worse thing of all , and I pick them up to check I ’m
167643	167658	167662	167662	him	536	’m going to look like a whale . He really has told everyone . I ’m

167743	167748	167749	167749	He	84	‘ No , Tom . ’
167753	167760	167749	167749	He	84	‘ What ’s wrong with Tom ? ’
167761	167764	167765	167765	I	2813	‘ Nothing , ’
167768	167781	167782	167782	He	84	‘ I just wo n’t be naming any of my babies it . ’
167796	167801	167802	167802	Sally	60	‘ Congratulations , Ava . ’
167817	167820	167809	167809	I	2813	‘ Coffee ? ’
167821	167827	167828	167828	I	2813	‘ Please . Three sugars . ’
167847	167854	167809	167809	I	2813	‘ How are you , Sal ? ’
167855	167858	167859	167859	she	60	‘ Amazing . ’

167939	167954	167932	167932	I	2813	‘ Oh , sorry ! I was just wondering what shade you would call that ’
167955	167958	167970	167970	She	85	‘ What ? ’
167959	167969	167970	167970	She	85	‘ Your tan . I ’d say deep bronze . ’
167983	167989	167990	167990	I	2813	‘ So , babies now ? ’
167998	168001	167990	167990	I	2813	‘ Yes . ’
168042	168047	168035	168035	she	85	‘ Congratulations , Ava . ’

168188	168198	168187	168187	I	2813	’m laughing at . She starts chuckling , too . ‘
168205	168217	168218	168218	He	374	’ I ask , having not gotten any answer from Victoria . ‘
168225	168229	168218	168218	He	374	’ She answers . ‘

168295	168308	168284	168284	She	87	’ My laughing abates fast . I ’d forgotten about my admirer . ‘
168314	168352	168311	168311	she	87	’ I ask casually , riffling through my bag for my phone when it occurs to me that I ’ve still not turned it on . It ’s been off since Thursday morning when Jesse impounded it . ‘
168356	168363	168311	168311	she	87	’ He straightens his aqua tie . ‘

169594	169618	169568	169568	She	87	‘ Yes , fine , but I ’ve changed my mind on the cabinets for the kitchen . Can we meet to discuss ? ’

169696	169714	169695	169695	I	2813	’m not at all affected by my last two telephone conversations . I feel empowered , like I ’m
169759	169797	169758	169758	I	2813	’m the last the leave the office . Patrick did n’t return to work as planned , but called to assure me that he ’d be in tomorrow . I ’ll talk to him then , but I ’m

169855	169860	169865	169865	he	2084	‘ Constructive . Yours ? ’
169861	169864	169865	169865	he	2084	‘ Magnificent . ’

169916	169930	169931	169931	He	2084	‘ The Manor , girl . How did it go with your boss ? ’
169947	169958	169931	169931	He	2084	‘ It did n’t . He was n’t in today . ’

170086	170199	170085	170085	I	2813	’m not waiting in the bar . After having him to myself for three days , my first day back at work has been the longest ever . I hot foot it past the stairs , towards the back of The Manor and through the summer room before John can catch me . The usual gatherings of members are here , but I do n’t hang around to gage the reaction to my presence . I steam straight into Jesse ’s office , without knocking and without stopping to think that I could be barging in on a business meeting . I ’ve had some shocks when doing this before . And I ’m
170205	170208	170209	170209	I	2813	‘ Dan ? ’

170388	170392	170393	170393	Dan	464	‘ Making amends . ’
170405	170418	170393	170393	Dan	464	‘ I did n’t want to go home without sorting this out . ’

I know he ’s in pursuit , and not just because of his thundering footsteps , echoing behind me . I pass the kitchens , the bar and restaurant and skid on my heels when I find Dan standing by the huge round table in the entrance hall . He ’s not doing anything or talking to anyone . John is here , too , and I know why that is . It ’s the same reason why John accompanied me everywhere in the early days . I watch in apprehension as Dan looks around and John tries to usher him on , but he ’s not shifting , not even for the big guy . Jesse ’s chest hits my back , and I ’m

I just hope that whatever happens , Dan does n’t go squealing to my parents , and I have every faith my husband will stop that from happening . I push the door open and find Kate braced over the sink , her red hair completely concealing her face as she looks into the bowl . ‘
174436	174468	174353	174353	I	2813	’ I tread carefully , not wanting her to go on the defensive . She pulls her head up with some effort and shows me glass blue eyes full of despair . ‘

174483	174536	174482	174482	I	2813	’m shocked that she would even ask . A little reckless perhaps , but never a whore . I ’ve labelled all of the women here exactly that , and in truth , Kate has been venturing into the same exploits as all of them , so how is she different ? I ’m
174578	174707	174577	174577	I	2813	’m very suddenly seeing the ladies of The Manor in a different light . I know for sure that many of them are only here for one purpose and that purpose is a tall , lean God who is no longer available . He has a wife and now twins on the way which has both shocked these women and pissed them off . Memberships are being cancelled to prove it , as well as some of the relentless ones taking things further . Like drugging me , or trying to run me off the road , or sending me a threatening note . Suddenly , it becomes a very frightening thought that any one of these women could be behind this . Has Jesse got an inkling ? ‘
174719	174730	174717	174717	Ava	536	’ Kate ’s question snaps me from my disturbing thoughts . ‘

174763	174773	174762	174762	You	536	’re going to deny it again , are’t you ? ’

174802	174812	174813	174813	I	2813	‘ Kate , we were past it weeks ago . ’
174814	174848	174849	174849	He	2160	’m completely exasperated , but so relieved . My blind friend has finally seen the light , or admitted that she seen it long ago — whichever . I do n’t honestly care . ‘

He ’s doing it firstly because he wo n’t risk the Australian Mafia turning up in London , and secondly because he knows I ’ll be a wreck if anything happens to Dan , which is highly likely if Jesse does n’t get him out of the diabolical situation that the idiot has gotten himself into . I wo n’t hold my breath that Jesse will see a penny of his money again . Dan would n’t earn enough in a lifetime to pay him back . ‘

These are the first words I have spoken since watching Dan leave Jesse ’s office , and not because I have n’t been spoken to . I could n’t even muster up the strength to growl a warning at Sarah as we passed her in the entrance hall of The Manor . She smiled awkwardly , refrained from laying her wandering hands all over Jesse and stepped back , almost warily , like she was fully expecting a backlash from me . The surprise was clear when I ignored her presence , choosing to walk on and leave Jesse to talk business with her . And I know that ’s all it was and all it ever will be . Business . ‘

178047	178106	178045	178045	Clive	90	’ Jesse sounds just as cheerful , as if being reminded of his peanuts . He ’s not pushed too much conversation on the journey back to the city , letting me quietly reflect on my recent revelation — the revelation that my brother is stupid and my husband is now two hundred grand lighter because of it . ‘
178123	178146	178121	178121	Ava	536	’ His instruction is stern , and I smile fondly as his crabby face disappears when the doors meet in the middle . ‘

He ’s concerned , which makes me concerned , and very very curious . I slowly pivot , wanting to close my eyes , but far too inquisitive to do it . And then the wall slowly comes into view , and I stop breathing . A choked gasp flies from my gaping mouth , and I ’ve taken a step back because Jesse ’s chest is pressed up against me . Or maybe he has stepped forward to steady me . I ’m
178795	178844	178794	178794	I	2813	’m naked , my eyes are dropped low and my lips are parted . My hair is a mass of glossy waves , framing my lust filled face and the sensual vibes pumping from my body in the still shot is tangible . I can feel it as I ’m
178865	178944	178864	178864	I	2813	’m gasping again as I spot a motion shot of my back as I rush down the steps of The Manor . It would n’t be particularly strange , but I can clearly see the head of a calla lily , extending from the side of my fleeing body . And I register my dress . It ’s my navy pencil dress . It ’s the dress I wore to my very first consultation with Mr Jesse Ward . ‘

178968	179030	178864	178864	I	2813	’ His voice is quiet and unsure . I swing around , my mouth still gaping . I ca n’t possibly speak . The lump in my throat is doing too good a job of stopping me . He ’s biting his lip , watching me closely . I swallow and turn back to the wall . The Ava wall . I ’m
179034	179043	179033	179033	I	2813	’m at the launch night of Lusso ; I ’m
179057	179070	179056	179056	I	2813	’m in the shower , the kitchen , on the terrace . I ’m
179078	179090	179077	179077	I	2813	’m sitting on my stool in bar at The Manor . I ’m
179100	179126	179099	179099	I	2813	’m storming away from him in an oversized , cream knitted jumper . I smile , noting so many shots of my back from where I ’m
179141	179147	179140	179140	I	2813	’m having a strop . I ’m
179181	179187	179180	179180	I	2813	’m laughing with Kate ; I ’m
179196	179203	179195	179195	I	2813	’m eating lunch in Baroque ; I ’m
179211	179237	179210	179210	I	2813	’m tapping my front tooth with my fingernail . I also see myself slouched in the passenger seat of the DBS , clearly drunk . I ’m
179244	179255	179243	179243	I	2813	’m collapsed on the grass in The Green Park . I ’m
179264	179274	179263	179263	I	2813	’m getting changed into my baggy shit , and I ’m
179280	179294	179279	179279	I	2813	’m asleep on the jet and standing on the veranda in Paradise . I ’m
179329	179436	179328	179328	I	2813	’m asleep in his bed and asleep in his arms — there are so many of me asleep in his arms . Every facial expression imaginable and every habit I have is displayed in one of these pictures . It ’s like my life in images since I first met this man . And I was n’t aware of any of it . He really is obsessed with me , and if I ’d have known about this in the early days , like when he persistently pursued me , I think I ’d have ran faster and farther . Not now , though . Now I ’m
179452	179470	179451	179451	I	2813	’m astounded and unaware that my feet have taken me to the foot of the wall . I ’m
179497	179500	179501	179501	Jesse	306	‘ Here , ’
179529	179537	179538	179538	I	2813	‘ I want you to sign it . ’
179565	179572	179573	179573	I	2813	‘ Sign it with my name ? ’
179580	179585	179586	179586	He	222	‘ Yes , wherever . ’
179607	179793	179606	179606	I	2813	’m confronted with . I step forward and pop the lid from the pen , looking for a spare space for me to scribble my name , but then I spot the first shot that he ever took of me and I approach it , armed with my pen . Smiling to myself , I write beneath the shot of me fleeing The Manor . Today I met you . This day was the beginning of the rest of my life . From this moment , I was your Ava x Then I make my way over to the image of me sitting by the docks on the launch night of Lusso . Today I realised how in deep I was . And I wanted to be so much deeper with you . I move along the wall to the picture of me drunk in Jesse ’s car and smile as I write ; Today I learnt that you can dance . I also admitted to myself that I was in love with you , and I think I might have told you too . I ’m
179826	179834	179825	179825	I	2813	’m just for your eyes . Then I ’m
179870	179997	179869	179869	I	2813	’m for your touch and for your pleasure only . But my favourite part of today was when you told me that you love me . My pen drifts over to the shot of me handcuffed . Today you introduced me to the retribution fuck . I quickly scan the wall and find a picture of me walking in front of him through the foyer of The Ritz . Today I found out how old you are … and that you do n’t like being handcuffed . I ca n’t stop . Each and every image brings a thought , and I find myself marking picture after picture with my memories in words . He does n’t stop me . I just keep going , like I ’m
180119	180157	180118	180118	I	2813	’m sure I ’ll be thinking of more captions to add . It ’s the one of me standing on the veranda in Paradise . I push my pen to the wall . Today I decided that you ’re
180244	180246	180229	180229	I	2813	‘ I ’m
180249	180423	180229	180229	I	2813	’ I whisper quietly , but he ’s not looking at me . He ’s studying all of my captions , his eyes travelling across the wall and pausing every now and then to read what I have written . He takes the pen and moves towards the picture of me fleeing The Manor , and then gets up close and personal with the wall . I ca n’t see what he ’s writing , and I shift to try and look around his body , but he ’s too close . He finally moves away , and I see it , scrolled across the top of the image . Today my heart started beating again . Today you became mine . I press my lips together and watch as he moves across to an image of me seated in the long grass of The Manor ’s grounds in my wedding dress , top to toe in ivory lace and with the sun shooting bullets of light through the trees behind me . I ’m
180520	180541	180542	180542	Ava	536	’m wrapped around his big body . His palms are cupping my bum and his eyes and burning into mine . ‘
180555	180556	180542	180542	Ava	536	’ ‘
180564	180565	180542	180542	Ava	536	’ ‘
180593	180614	180583	180583	I	2813	’ Those words have me pushing his suit jacket from his arms and my lips crashing to his , ravenously . ‘
180617	180636	180583	180583	I	2813	’ he warns gently , moving each arm in turn so I can rid him of his jacket . ‘
180642	180669	180583	180583	I	2813	’ I force my lips to slow their devouring of him — easier said than done when I have n’t had him for two full days . ‘
180676	180694	180583	180583	I	2813	’ I mumble , pulling at his tie , probably strangling him in the process , but I ’m
180703	180706	180707	180707	He	2229	‘ Hey , ’
180722	180737	180721	180721	I	2813	’m not making it easy for him , although it ’s not long before I ’m
180781	180787	180788	180788	he	2229	‘ Take your dress off . ’
181022	181029	181030	181030	he	306	‘ Incredible , is n’t it ? ’
181047	181050	181030	181030	he	306	‘ Yes , ’
181056	181061	181051	181051	I	2813	‘ Just like you . ’
181062	181066	181030	181030	he	306	‘ And you . ’
181067	181071	181072	181072	I	2813	‘ More you . ’
181075	181087	181088	181088	I	2813	‘ Show me how incredible you are . I ’ve forgotten . ’
181155	181299	181300	181300	Jesse	306	’m laid on the huge corner couch and my backside is pulled to the end so my lower body is propped up on the arm . He removes his trousers and boxers , revealing the beauty of his cock , hard , ready , and within touching distance , but he kneels down at the end of the couch , taking it clean from my view . I do n’t have time to complain . My knickers are removed , my legs are pulled apart and his mouth is on the inside of my thigh fast , kissing gently , shifting to the other thigh and teasing softly . Forward and back he goes , moving from one side to the other , getting higher with each set , his hands spreading me further as he makes his way to my pulsing centre . ‘
181302	181338	181300	181300	Jesse	306	’ I take in air , my legs needing to move . My hand flies up to grasp the leather on the backrest of the couch , my other cupping the back of his head . ‘
181347	181361	181300	181300	Jesse	306	’ he asks seriously , pulling back and blowing over my raw flesh . ‘
181364	181382	181300	181300	Jesse	306	’ My hands are twitching as his cool breath spreads over me and travels down my thighs . ‘
181385	181450	181453	181453	Ava	536	’ I try to close my legs when I feel the first dash of contact from his tongue on my clitoris , but he ’s just teasing me , giving me a taste of what ’s to come , and my legs are going nowhere , except where he decides , which is wider , making me sensitive , more open and more frenzied . ‘
181455	181483	181453	181453	Ava	536	’ His tongue enters me and then licks an unspeakably delicious stroke up my middle . I cry out , my head thrashing from side to side . ‘
181486	181499	181453	181453	Ava	536	’ He ’s cocky and sure , and has earned that privilege . ‘
181508	181535	181506	181506	baby	536	’ My fisted hand that is now clenching at his hair should tell him all he needs to know — that and my inaudible mumbling . I ’m
181651	181655	181656	181656	he	536	‘ Tell me , ’
181666	181677	181656	181656	he	536	‘ It feels like you were made to fit me . ’
181815	181897	181814	181814	I	2813	’m ever impatient , my lower legs curling around his lower back and pulling him towards me , but he ’s going nowhere . Not until he says so . And he does n’t say so . He just smirks that almost undetectable smirk while he keeps his eyes down , still teasing me with irregular and torturous skims of his slippery head across the very tip of my oversensitive small nub of nerves . He ’s killing me , and I ’m
181907	181915	181906	181906	I	2813	’m too engrossed by his cruel pleasure . ‘
181921	181935	181950	181950	his	2813	’ he asks , but he still wo n’t look at me . I ’m
181964	181969	181970	181970	My	2813	‘ If you like . ’
181988	181993	181994	181994	He	2813	‘ If I like ? ’
182024	182034	182023	182023	I	2813	’m impatient and demanding , so I control it . ‘
182041	182067	182069	182069	my	2813	’ In a little further he goes . I know my lips have just parted , and I know my chest is expanding fast . I ’m
182085	182128	182129	182131	My beautiful girl	0	’m held in place with one arm while his other hand reaches forward and yanks the cups of my bra down . Each nipple is given a sharp pinch , and I bite back a scream of pleasure mixed with intense pain . ‘
182139	182154	182129	182131	My beautiful girl	0	’ he muses , adjusting his grip of me , ready to pound forward . ‘
182166	182189	182159	182159	she	0	’ He does n’t pound forward , though . He eases in lazily , and my head rolls back on a groan . ‘
182196	182215	182222	182222	Ava	536	’ He ’s completely submerged within me now , the tip of his impressive cock brushing my womb . ‘
182224	182254	182222	182222	Ava	536	’ He extracts himself , and this time he really does pound forward , surprisingly hard . My arms begin to shake , followed by my head in despair . ‘
182257	182270	182222	182222	Ava	536	’ I demand . He ’s teased me too far this time . ‘

182333	182336	182337	182337	He	536	‘ Yes , ’
182353	182360	182337	182337	He	536	‘ It ’s a good book . ’

182464	182480	182441	182441	I	2813	’ His palm collides with my arse on a loud smack , and I yelp . ‘
182487	182501	182481	182481	You	2813	’ I remind him on a shout as he re - enters me . ‘
182512	182527	182481	182481	You	2813	’ He reminds me on another sharp assault of his palm across my bum . ‘

182534	182571	182572	182572	You	2813	’ I persuade my head to lift and when it does , I go dizzy with gratefulness . My tongue leaves my mouth of its own accord and journeys across my bottom lip slowly , enticingly . ‘
182576	182601	182602	182602	I	2813	’ I breathe , watching each finely tuned muscle on his abdomen bunch and his biceps bulge from holding my lower body to him . ‘

182698	182711	182681	182681	he	306	‘ Yes ! And it ’s telling me I need to come ! ’

My hands land on his arse and my nails dig into his solid cheeks as he ravishes me with his mouth , our tongues dancing wildly and hungrily . ‘

183763	183825	183644	183644	I	2813	’ And that word seals the deal . He ’s way past the point of return , so I seize my opportunity , pulling harder on his hair and reaching up to sink my teeth into his sweat glistening shoulder in an attempt to supress my scream of release and encourage his . It works , as I knew it would . ‘

The urge to cuddle him overwhelms my teasing streak when I see his concerned frown wriggle its way onto his brow . God love this man . That bottom lip is being nibbled away , as he watches my hand move slowly towards the jar and my finger disappear with the depths of creamy goo . I actually grimace as my finger squelches back out , and I know my nose has just wrinkled in disgust at the sight of a huge dollop all over my index finger . ‘

I brace myself for his none of our business speech , but it does n’t come . Nothing comes , actually . He does n’t scoff , and he does n’t refuse . He ’s just looking at me on a small smile . ‘

Her hair is tied up today , her short black bob giving her a pathetic excuse for a ponytail , such a bitchy thought , but it ’s going to be the first of many . I can feel it , and they might not just be thoughts . She blanks me completely and looks straight at my bare chested God . Why the hell did n’t he put some jeans and a t - shirt on ? ‘

I leave them and head straight to Jesse ’s office , finding his suit jacket where he discarded it last night . I root quickly through his pockets , finding a neatly folded wedge of notes and his phone before locating the picture from his inside pocket . It ’s a little worn ; no doubt from being transferred from pocket to pocket . I exit hastily armed with exhibit B and find the distance between Jesse and Coral has closed . Jesse is still in the same location , but Coral is moving forward . ‘
190382	190396	190380	190380	Jesse	306	’ She goes to touch him , but he yanks his arms away . ‘

190518	190559	190560	190560	You	2295	’ He moves in and leans down , making her pull back slightly . Jesse ’s tone is full of venom , and intended to be . He ’s doing a damn good job at trampling all over her himself . ‘
190561	190588	190589	190589	I	2813	’re just like the rest of them , but even more desperate . Get a good seeing to and you think your life depends on it . ’
190605	190649	190604	190604	I	2813	’m a raging bag of pregnant hormones . Jesse looks her up and down , and I get the glimpse of the conceited man who treated women like objects for so long - the man who drank , fucked and threw them out . ‘
190665	190666	190668	190668	I	2813	’ ‘

190717	190741	190713	190713	She	2849	’ I interject , uncomfortable with seeing Jesse so close to her , even if he is snarling in her face , and I ’m

190807	190810	190783	190783	I	2813	’ She frowns ‘

191040	191064	191010	191010	I	2813	’ I give her an expectant look , but she ’s saying nothing . I throw her picture into the space between us . ‘
191078	191103	191010	191010	I	2813	’ I do n’t remove my eyes from her and I wo n’t until that door is shut and she is firmly behind it . ‘
191117	191203	191206	191206	him	2303	’ I ask , stepping forward . She bends and picks her picture up before backing out of the door , her eyes flicking nervously from Jesse to his deranged , pregnant wife , and as soon as her body is over the threshold of the penthouse door , I slam it in her face , then turn to look at my ex - whore of a husband . He ’s chomping nervously on that bottom lip and maybe I should n’t be , but I ’m
191375	191401	191374	191374	I	2813	’m mentally exhausted already . A life of peace and comfort . That ’s what I want and need , and every time I think we ’re

191469	191546	191547	191547	I	2813	’ I step away from him and finish rinsing my hair . He does n’t know what to do , so as usual when he finds himself in this situation , he tries to win me back over with his touch . I expect to hear a snort of disbelief or even a scorn for denying him , but I do n’t . I do , however , feel his hand slide back around my stomach . ‘
191550	191556	191557	191557	I	2813	’m not in the mood . ’

196090	196100	196101	196101	I	2813	‘ I ’ll be as quick as I can . ’
196124	196127	196128	196128	She	87	‘ Ava ! ’
196137	196146	196128	196128	She	87	‘ Hi , Ruth . How are you ? ’
196147	196153	196154	196154	She	87	‘ Fabulous ! Come in . ’
196216	196224	196225	196225	she	87	‘ Did you have a good weekend ? ’
196240	196249	196250	196250	I	2813	‘ Yes , thank you , and you ? ’
196264	196267	196268	196268	she	87	‘ Wonderful , ’
196286	196298	196278	196278	I	2813	‘ So , what did you want to discuss ? Cupboards ? ’
196299	196335	196340	196340	she	87	‘ No , do n’t worry about the cupboards . We ’ll stick with the original . Now , the wine fridge , remind me , did we opt for the single or double width ? ’
196353	196356	196357	196357	I	2813	‘ Double . ’
196362	196431	196361	196361	I	2813	’m not at all comfortable . She could have called for both of those points . My phone starts ringing from my bag , but I ignore it , even though it ’s Angel . I do n’t plan on being here for much longer , and there is absolutely no need for me to be , so I can call him back as soon as I escape . ‘
196436	196451	196361	196361	I	2813	’ I ask dubiously . My phone rings off , then starts again immediately . ‘
196459	196468	196361	196361	I	2813	’ she asks , looking at my bag . ‘
196473	196492	196497	196497	Ruth	87	’ I shake my head mildly . She does n’t know it , but it ’s in disbelief . ‘

196503	196511	196501	196501	Urm	306	’ She looks frantically around the kitchen . ‘
196524	196540	196541	196541	I	2813	’ she says , dragging a magazine over from the other side of the table . ‘
196546	196588	196589	196589	Ava	536	’ She points to an oak alternative on the cover of the magazine . I start to voice my reasons for sticking to walnut when my phone cuts me off . My shoulders sag . Ruth pushes my bag towards me . ‘
196606	196642	196643	196643	Jesse	306	’ I close my eyes in a give - me - strength gesture and reach into my bag to retrieve my phone before getting up from the table and making my way into the hall . ‘
196646	196657	196643	196643	Jesse	306	’m in a meeting . Can I call you back ? ’
196658	196660	196645	196645	I	2813	‘ I ’m
196665	196669	196662	196662	Ava	536	’ he murmurs . ‘
196676	196677	196662	196662	Ava	536	’ ‘
196683	196698	196662	196662	Ava	536	’ I ask on a grin , knowing damn well what the cure is . ‘
196714	196715	196716	196716	I	2813	’ ‘
196717	196730	196716	196716	I	2813	’m not sure . I have a meeting at two with Patrick . ’
196770	196781	196769	196769	I	2813	’m happily married , most of the time . And I ’m
196794	196799	196787	196787	I	2813	‘ Oh good . You ’re
196813	196817	196855	196855	he	2813	’ Jesse says . ‘
196820	196821	196855	196855	he	2813	’ ‘
196833	196834	196855	196855	he	2813	’ ‘
196857	196886	196855	196855	he	2813	’ I answer his question with my own . I ’ve probably dropped John in it , but what ’s the point in pretending I do n’t know ? ‘
196890	196900	196887	196887	He	2813	’ I can hear his grin in his tone . ‘

196915	196935	196936	196936	Jesse	306	’ I realise immediately what I ’ve just said , and I also notice my hand caressing my belly . ‘

196975	196980	196970	196970	I	2813	’ he counters proudly . ‘
196987	196988	196982	196982	I	2813	’ ‘
196994	197014	196982	196982	I	2813	’ I encourage him , hoping he lands in Babies R Us and does n’t emerge until gone six . ‘
197019	197035	197036	197036	I	2813	’ I end the conversation on something that ’ll placate him for a little longer . ‘
197039	197043	197036	197036	I	2813	’ he sighs . ‘
197046	197061	197036	197036	I	2813	’ I smile and hang up , making my way back to the kitchen . ‘
197066	197077	197036	197036	I	2813	’ I wave my phone as I sit back down . ‘
197083	197143	197144	197144	I	2813	’ She looks lost in thought as she studies me for a while , and then her stare drops to my tummy , which is tucked neatly under the table . I knew she must have heard , but a tiny part of me was hoping she had n’t . I start scribbling down a load of complete nonsense . ‘
197175	197180	197181	197181	I	2813	’re ditching the walnut ? ’
197213	197216	197204	197204	I	2813	‘ Ruth ? ’
197217	197232	197233	197233	She	2363	‘ Oh , sorry ! I was miles away . Yes , please do . ’
197237	197241	197233	197233	She	2363	‘ Ava , I ’m
197268	197269	197260	197260	We	2364	’ ‘
197279	197280	197274	197274	I	2813	’ ‘
197283	197291	197274	197274	I	2813	’ Her abrupt question increases my unease . ‘

197321	197334	197312	197312	we	2364	’ She smiles , but it goes nowhere near her blue eyes . ‘
197340	197371	197372	197372	He	420	’ I ca n’t help the sharp inhale of breath . Not when she ’s linked alcohol , getting carried , away and my husband all in two close sentences . ‘
197376	197412	197372	197372	He	420	’ I start to pack my things away , keen to leave . She may have innocently touched a nerve , but she ’s still gazing longingly at me , and it ’s becoming unbearable . ‘
197422	197463	197464	197464	Ava	536	’ I make to stand a bit too hastily and catch my heel on the leg of the chair , causing me to stumble slightly . She ’s on me in a second , holding my arm to steady me . ‘
197470	197471	197467	197467	you	2813	’ ‘
197476	197534	197467	197467	you	2813	’ I collect myself , trying my hardest not to appear uneasy , but now she has a hold of me and she ’s not letting go . In fact , she ’s trailing her hand up my arm . I tense from top to toe as it makes it to my cheek and strokes me gently . ‘
197538	197549	197467	197467	you	2813	’ she whispers . I should move back , but I ’m
197569	197574	197575	197575	I	2813	‘ I should go , ’
197612	197619	197606	197606	She	2366	‘ Yes , perhaps you should . ’
197662	197667	197668	197668	he	2813	‘ Ava , girl ? ’
197683	197770	197775	197775	John	2813	’m physically okay . Once he ’s satisfied himself that I am , he looks past me and slowly reaches up to remove his sunglasses . His action would n’t appear so strange if he ’d have left his glasses on , but he has n’t , and now he ’s looking up the path to Ruth ’s house . I slow my escape and turn to see what ’s caught his interest , seeing the front door close to Ruth ’s home as I do . ‘
197777	197786	197775	197775	John	2813	’ I ask , feeling better now that I ’m
197799	197809	197810	197810	His	2813	‘ Nothing , girl . Get in the car . ’
197845	197854	197837	197837	He	2813	‘ What ’s got you in a state ? ’
197868	197877	197878	197878	I	2813	‘ I think I have a female admirer . ’
197908	197918	197919	197919	John	2813	‘ Something else to send the mother fucker crazy . ’
197923	197929	197919	197919	John	2813	‘ What ’s her name ? ’
197930	197938	197939	197939	He	2813	‘ Ruth Quinn . She ’s strange . ’
197943	197949	197939	197939	He	2813	‘ Back to the office ? ’
197950	197955	197956	197956	I	2813	‘ Please , John . ’
197997	198002	198003	198003	John	2813	‘ What ’s that ? ’
198014	198017	198018	198018	I	2813	’m holding . ‘
198019	198023	198024	198024	I	2813	’m not sure . ’
198032	198038	198039	198039	I	2813	‘ A courier delivered it . ’
198040	198101	198039	198039	I	2813	’m being totally honest because if this turns out to be another warning , then I ’ll be telling Jesse anyway , so it ’s of no consequence if John knows , too . I peel the seal and pull out a piece of card and as soon as I clock the cut out letters , I lose my breath . ‘
198106	198162	198039	198039	I	2813	’ John asks , his voice laced with concern . I ca n’t speak . There is a certain level of maliciousness linked to these sorts of letters and as I stare down at the message , assembled with various newspaper and magazine cuttings , my casual disregard of my previous warning seems quite reckless . ‘
198168	198182	198039	198039	I	2813	’ I manage to splutter through my racing breath . I feel sick . ‘
198185	198186	198284	198286	the other one	3463	’ ‘
198217	198229	198198	198198	I	2813	’ I open the window to get some needed fresh air . ‘
198235	198264	198265	198265	I	2813	’ John keeps flicking his sunglass covered eyes over to the piece of card that I ’ve dropped in my lap . I read the message to him . ‘
198272	198281	198265	198265	I	2813	’ A frustrated curse shoots into the air . ‘
198295	198315	198292	198293	that one	3463	’ I try and collect my scattered thoughts and attempt to recall the exact wording of the other message . ‘
198331	198339	198326	198326	They	2372	’ I shake my head in frustration . ‘
198350	198352	198340	198340	I	2813	’ I ’m
198445	198462	198444	198444	I	2813	’m going to be facing a seriously pissed off male . I ’ve been so stupid . ‘
198470	198482	198488	198488	John	2813	’ John sounds concerned , only heightening my own worrying thoughts . ‘
198490	198523	198526	198526	girl	87	’ He ca n’t be so unwise to ask that question , and the deep breath and brief look of understanding that travel across his annoyed face tells me he ’s not . ‘
198528	198546	198526	198526	girl	87	’ He does n’t say I ’ve been foolish , but I know he ’s thinking it . ‘
198553	198558	198551	198551	Coral	1009	’ I say quietly . ‘
198571	198583	198551	198551	Coral	1009	’ He ’s restraining a small smile , I can tell . ‘
198596	198597	198603	198603	him	2813	’ ‘
198609	198643	198607	198607	I	2813	’ John asks seriously . I know what he means . No further elaboration is required and when he looks at me and nods at my pleading face , I know he understands . ‘
198651	198652	198649	198649	girl	87	’ ‘
198663	198664	198649	198649	girl	87	’ ‘
198684	198689	198690	198690	I	2813	’m not promising anything . ’
198699	198711	198690	198690	I	2813	‘ Thank you . Are you going back to The Manor ? ’
198712	198737	198683	198683	I	2813	‘ No , girl . I ’ll call him . You just get done at work , and I ’ll be waiting for you . ’
198738	198741	198742	198742	I	2813	‘ Okay . ’
198843	198962	198842	198842	I	2813	’m just tipping my third sugar into the mug when my shoulders rise and tense at the sound of my beloved husband ’s ringtone . If I could get away with it , I ’d ignore him , but he ’ll be calling the landline and failing that , charging into the office . Abandoning my coffee , I take deep breaths of courage as I go in search of my phone . This is n’t going to be a call that I can take in the openness of my office , so I hurry to the conference room and close the door behind me before connecting myself to what will be a raging mass of angry male . ‘
198970	198996	198842	198842	I	2813	’ I blurt down the line , immediately holding the phone away from my ear once I ’ve made my plea . I was right . ‘
199005	199009	199010	199010	You	2382	’ he yells . ‘
199016	199043	199010	199010	You	2382	’ My eyes close , and I quietly accept his rant , keeping my phone at a safe distance . He ’s breathing erratically between scorns . ‘
199073	199080	199082	199082	you	2382	’ I hear a door slam . ‘
199094	199095	199096	199096	I	2813	’ ‘
199097	199100	199101	199101	I	2813	’m sorry ! ’
199102	199107	199108	199108	I	2813	’m close to tears . ‘
199122	199123	199116	199116	I	2813	’ ‘
199148	199182	199183	199183	I	2813	’ He ’s so mad , but I know it ’s because he ’s not in control . He ca n’t control what ’s happening , and it ’s sending him crazy mad . ‘
199189	199190	199183	199183	I	2813	’ ‘
199193	199227	199230	199230	you	2382	’ Silence falls after his curse , and I can see a clear mental image of him slumped in his office chair , rubbing a furious circle on his temple with his fingertips . ‘
199231	199239	199257	199257	I	2813	’re not leaving that office this afternoon . ’
199240	199256	199257	199257	I	2813	‘ I have a meeting with Patrick . I ’ll speak to him about Mikael . ’
199258	199289	199257	199257	I	2813	’m trying to tell him what I know he wants to hear . I ca n’t work with Mikael , even if I do n’t think it ’s him anymore . ‘
199300	199322	199323	199323	Steve	134	’ he says more calmly than I know he ’s feeling . I knew that , but what has convinced Jesse ? ‘
199393	199414	199386	199386	he	74	’ Jesse ’s tone gets sharper as he finishes the sentence . It ’s a reference to the first threat . ‘
199424	199429	199435	199435	Ava	536	’ I ask tentatively ? ‘
199437	199441	199435	199435	Ava	536	’ he sighs . ‘

199464	199490	199454	199455	The tracker	2388	’ I rest my tired arse down on one of the plush chairs surrounding the conference table . I could point out to him that I ’m
199541	199551	199552	199552	I	2813	‘ Should I come to The Manor after work ? ’
199555	199595	199596	199596	His	134	‘ No , John will take you home as soon as you ’ve spoken to Patrick . I ’ll meet you there . Given this new information I ’ve just found out , I ’ve got Steve swinging by . ’
199663	199687	199651	199651	I	2813	‘ Do n’t leave that office , and once John ’s taken you home , you stay put . Do you understand me ? ’
199688	199692	199693	199693	I	2813	‘ I understand . ’
199696	199708	199693	199693	I	2813	‘ Good girl . I ’ll speak with Steve , but I ’m
199715	199718	199714	199714	I	2813	’m done . ’
199719	199724	199725	199725	I	2813	‘ I love you . ’

199837	199877	199836	199836	I	2813	’m mistaken and his deep husk will install some further reassurance . It ’s only when the door to the conference room swings open and Patrick appears that I finally pull my mobile away and accept he ’s gone . ‘

There will be nothing coming from my mouth because my throat has closed up . I watch him round the table and shake hands with Patrick before formally introducing himself to my colleagues . When he makes it to Sal , he barely looks at her and she undoubtedly burns bright red and looks down to the floor . She ’s been seeing Mikael ! My mouth gapes as I watch her fidget . That is how he knows I ’m

I do notice how smart he looks in his suit , though , and I definitely spot the look of alarm on his face at the sight of the big guy , escorting me . John has that effect on most people , just like he did me . John punches the code in and stands back to let me enter the elevator before he joins me . He taps the code in again . ‘
202624	202662	202663	202665	The mother fucker	3332	’ I ask , hoping to God he does n’t know the significance of the code . He smiles down at me , and I ca n’t work out if it ’s a knowing look or not . ‘
202684	202794	202795	202795	Ava	536	’ I cough a little , thinking just how creative Jesse can be when he reaches that zero . Wonderfully creative , in fact . Mind - blowingly creative . I need to run that bath , but as the doors of the elevator open , I uncharitably remember that it ’s early and Cathy is more than likely still faffing around the penthouse . Letting us in , I immediately head towards the kitchen and dump my bag on the island , but I find no Cathy , so I set off upstairs in search of her , set on relieving her for the rest of the day . ‘

I let him open and close doors while I prop myself up against the glass bannister , arms folded across my chest , patiently waiting . There is no way I should be whining about this , given our surprise visitor this morning . ‘
202941	202942	202943	202943	That	203	’ ‘
202948	202982	202943	202943	That	203	’ I smile , pushing my lower back away from the glass . John abruptly halts , his eyebrows hovering somewhere between the tops of his shades and the top of his head . ‘
202991	203009	202989	202989	girl	87	’ He ’s really grumpy , just when I thought he and I had reached an understanding . ‘

203032	203038	203040	203040	Cathy	1284	’ I ask his back . ‘
203042	203066	203040	203040	Cathy	1284	’ he confirms , heading for the penthouse phone system , but his mobile starts ringing before he makes it to the landline . ‘
203069	203078	203079	203079	We	2438	’ he grunts , detouring into the kitchen . ‘
203080	203097	203098	203098	His	2813	’re here now . Cathy ’s already left , but I ’ll stay until you arrive . ’
203119	203126	203127	203127	John	2813	‘ Blue door , needs painting . ’
203168	203197	203155	203155	He	2813	‘ Lansdowne Terrace . I ca n’t be sure . I only got a glimpse , but if it ’s not her , then she has a doppelganger . ’
203199	203317	203198	203198	I	2813	’m unconsciously walking towards John ’s voice . I heard that right , so it ’s not like I need to gain closeness to ensure my ears are n’t failing me . But his attempt to keep this from my ear shot , coupled with the mention of Ruth Quinn ’s address and the fact that John obviously recognises her , makes me need to see his face to gage his expression . I know it ’s not going to be good , not when he ’s talking to Jesse , which means Jesse knows Ruth Quinn , too . My blood is running colder with each step I take towards John ’s low , hushed tone . ‘
203324	203335	203336	203337	Ruth Quinn	87	’ John ’s pacing the kitchen at the far end . ‘
203385	203419	203422	203422	she	87	’ My blood is ice and my body frozen in place as I watch John turn slowly and register my presence . He might be black , but he has definitely just paled . ‘
203424	203477	203478	203478	Jesse	306	’ I ask him . His huge chest expands and he reaches up to take his glasses off . I wish he ’d have left them on because the rare sight of his eyes has just confirmed my fears . They are worried , and the big guy does n’t do worried . ‘
203498	203547	203550	203550	she	2445	’ John ’s mobile leaves his ear , and I hear Jesse ’s angry yell down the phone . I ca n’t decipher what he ’s saying , but his frustrated shout says a thousand words . The mention of police intervention ca n’t be good , either . ‘
203552	203563	203550	203550	she	2445	’ I grate , my breathing starting to accelerate . I ’m

203662	203693	203696	203696	she	2446	’m sensing I should know about is re - heating my frozen veins . John hands me the phone , and I do n’t delay swiping it from his hand . ‘
203698	203755	203756	203756	I	2813	’ I remain calm and clear , but if I do n’t get an answer , then I ’ll be raging very quickly . And I already know that it ’ll be the blood pressure raising kind of furious . He ’s heaving down the phone , his purposeful , thumping footsteps evident in the background . ‘
203757	203761	203756	203756	I	2813	’m not sure . ’
203762	203768	203769	203769	I	2813	‘ What do you mean ? ’
203770	203788	203789	203789	I	2813	’m shouting . He did n’t answer , not satisfactorily . He knows who Ruth Quinn is . ‘
203790	203800	203789	203789	I	2813	’m on my way home . We ’ll talk . ’
203801	203807	203789	203789	I	2813	‘ No , tell me ! ’
203808	203826	203827	203827	he	2813	‘ Ava , I did n’t want to say anything until I was sure it ’s her . ’

203976	203983	203992	203992	he	2813	‘ Will it make me run ? ’
203984	203991	203992	203992	he	2813	‘ I ’ll be home soon . ’
204160	204164	204165	204165	I	2813	’m really worried . ‘
204166	204198	204165	204165	I	2813	’m needed downstairs . You ’ll lock the door behind me and you wo n’t answer it unless I call you to say it ’s me . Where ’s your phone ? ’
204199	204204	204205	204205	I	2813	‘ What ’s happening ? ’
204212	204218	204219	204219	he	2813	‘ Where ’s your phone ? ’
204230	204240	204241	204241	He	2813	‘ In my bag . John , tell me . ’
204277	204300	204258	204258	He	2813	‘ Ava , now is n’t the time to argue with me . There ’s someone the concierge is suspicious of and I ’m
204313	204347	204369	204369	he	2813	’ I do n’t believe him . Nothing suggests I should ; not the tone of his voice or his body language . Everything is suggesting that I should be terrified , and I ’m
204353	204356	204357	204357	I	2813	‘ Okay , ’
204398	204478	204397	204397	I	2813	’m failing on every level to calm myself down . I just want Jesse . I do n’t care what he ’s got to tell me , I do n’t give a damn . I clench my phone and run up the stairs to the bedroom , quickly locating the key to Jesse ’s office from my underwear drawer before rushing back down and making quick work of unlocking the door . I know I ’ll feel better when I ’m
204689	204694	204695	204695	Her	87	‘ Do n’t bother . ’
204735	204752	204731	204731	she	464	‘ The lift will be out of action and Casey will stop you on the stairs . ’

204867	204875	204866	204866	I	2813	’m not stupid enough to wonder what they ’re
204878	204899	204900	204900	She	464	‘ Your husband ’s stupidity and my lover ’s desperate need to make me happy has almost made this boring . ’
204911	204922	204900	204900	She	464	‘ I think he ’s a little obsessed with you . ’
204958	204975	204957	204957	I	2813	’m helpless . The tip of her finger meets the wall where Jesse has written something . ‘
204982	204998	204999	205000	Jesse Ward	306	’ She laughs , a cold , sinister laugh , increasing my already potent unease . ‘
205022	205038	205040	205044	another scorned ex - lover	464	’ She does n’t mean that , but she definitely meant what came before . I ’m
205132	205215	205216	205216	You	2467	’m moving too . Not fast enough , though , because she is in front of me in seconds and now stroking my stomach thoughtfully . Then she draws her hand back and punches me . I scream , my body folding over protectively , my arms wrapping around my tummy , instinctively trying to protect my babies . She ’s screaming , too , grabbing at my hair and yanking me from Jesse ’s office into the openness of the penthouse . ‘
205222	205283	205216	205216	You	2467	’ she shouts , pushing me to the floor and kicking me accurately . Pain slices through me and my eyes tear up , flowing freely . If I could get my mind past the incredible pain and shock , then I think I could find the strength to find my anger . She ’s trying to kill our children . ‘
205301	205461	205297	205299	you pathetic bitch	2468	’ She pulls me to my feet and slaps me around the face , but the raging sting and flaming skin wo n’t pull my arms from my stomach , nothing will , not even the need to fly back at her . I even have my phone in my hand still , but I ca n’t risk giving her clear access to my stomach . My overloaded brain is urgently trying to guide me , give me instruction , but all I can think to do is accept her derangement and pray that all three of us come safely out the other end . If I ’ve ever thought that I might have been in hell , then this moment is proving me wrong . This is below the lowest level of the underworld . Her fist connects with my forearm on an angered , frenzied scream and my body concaves on a frightened , painful one . I ’m
205470	205657	205469	205469	I	2813	’m nowhere near dead , but the look in her eyes through my hazy vision tells me she wo n’t stop until I am . She ’s demented . Completely unhinged . What the hell did he do to this woman ? The front door crashes open and she ’s suddenly gone from in front of me . I struggle to turn , still clutching at my stomach , still crying in agony . I see her back disappear into the kitchen , and then my pouring eyes land on Jesse . His whole body is heaving . He ’s run up the stairs , and his fist is visibly swollen . His frantic eyes are running all over my body , his forehead is pouring with sweat and his face is a mixture of pure , raw terror and incensed , body shaking anger . It takes him a few moments to gather himself , and I can see he ’s torn between tending to me or dealing with the crazy woman who ’s broken into our home . I ca n’t talk , but I ’m
205741	205838	205740	205740	We	2471	’re standing in a perfect triangle , all breathing heavy , all flicking eyes to each other , but Ruth is the only one brandishing a knife . My phone drops from my hand , clattering loudly , but it does n’t draw her attention . The huge blade glimmers as she turns it casually in her hand . It ’s pointed in my direction , but the sight of the evil , razor sharp metal does n’t just make my fear rocket . It also makes my eyes fall onto Jesse ’s abdomen in horror . ‘
205843	205909	205840	205840	my	2813	’ I whisper , so quietly I know that I ’ve not been heard over the distressed rush of breaths coming from all three bodies in the room . He said that it happened in the car accident . That ’s what he said . I search for my brain , trying to locate the exact words , but I do n’t find them because they ’re
205929	205996	205928	205928	I	2813	’m horribly mistaken in my assumption , but I also doubt he would ’ve divulged the real reason — the reason that is standing here now , playing threateningly with a knife — a knife I know that she ’s prepared to use . I do n’t think anything else I could face will terrify me more . Now all four of us are in danger . ‘
206004	206025	206002	206002	Jesse	306	’ she spits , steadying her stance by shifting her feet further apart . She ’s getting ready to pounce . ‘
206032	206041	206002	206002	Jesse	306	’ Jesse replies calmly through his laboured breathing . ‘
206047	206052	206053	206053	I	2813	’ She smiles coldly . ‘
206104	206105	206106	206106	I	2813	’ ‘
206116	206137	206138	206138	I	2813	’ His referral to Ruth has my head snapping from the shiny blade to Jesse ’s sweaty face . Lauren ? ‘
206142	206202	206138	206138	I	2813	’ It ’s almost a plea , and it slices straight through my heart . He ’s trying to convince himself that he deserves me and the thought of him seeking approval from this deranged woman momentarily makes me forget about the dull ache in my stomach and the heated sting of my face . I feel anger simmering . ‘
206219	206254	206217	206217	yours	2474	’ She waves the knife at me and Jesse shifts nervously , his haunted greens flicking over to me briefly before settling back on Ruth — or Lauren . I do n’t even know . ‘

206266	206270	206271	206271	You	2474	’ She screams . ‘
206280	206314	206271	206271	You	2474	’ I gasp and swing my eyes to Jesse . He ’s chewing his lip , his eyes darting constantly between me and … his ex - wife ? He was married ? I ’m
206348	206371	206372	206372	Her	87	‘ You did n’t know ? Well , there ’s a surprise . It might also explain why you ’ve stuck around . ’
206383	206389	206376	206376	Jesse	306	‘ Nothing can break us . ’
206479	206481	206460	206460	His	306	‘ I ’m
206485	206489	206490	206490	I	2813	’ he murmurs . ‘
206496	206522	206490	206490	I	2813	’ He really has saved the best shocker till last , but I do n’t care . I mean it . Nothing can break us . ‘
206528	206544	206490	206490	I	2813	’ I try to assure him , but I can see defeatism swallowing him up . ‘
206549	206577	206578	206578	She	2476	’ Ruth spits , pulling both of our attention away from each other and back to the knife wielding , psychotic bitch who has invaded our lives . ‘
206585	206625	206626	206626	She	2476	’ I hope she ’s mistaken . I hope Jesse nods and explains that I know everything . The Manor , the drinking , now her … everything , But his head starts to shake , quadrupling my uncertainties . ‘
206634	206648	206626	206626	She	2476	’ The room starts to spin , and Jesse ’s goes to move . ‘
206654	206664	206665	206665	Ava	536	’ Ruth shouts , flicking the knife to him . ‘
206667	206679	206665	206665	Ava	536	’ He desperately needs to get to me . I know I ’m
206731	206746	206747	206747	she	2478	‘ Yes , we were married and he left me when I was pregnant . ’
206750	206786	206747	206747	she	2478	‘ I was forced to marry you because you were pregnant . I did n’t want to and you knew it . We were seventeen years old , Lauren . We fooled around one time . ’
206808	206818	206819	206819	She	2478	‘ Do n’t blame your decision on your parents ! ’

206849	206865	206841	206841	I	2813	’ The room is still spinning wildly , while I try to piece together what I ’m
206881	206984	206880	206880	I	2813	’m in such a hazardous situation . Through my confusion and alarm , I do , however , realise the importance of keeping myself safe . I need to get out of here . I start to back away , hoping her attention and anger will remain on Jesse as I quietly attempt my escape . I know this is going to end with her gunning for me , not Jesse . She wants to punish him , and she ’s going to do that by making him live without me . She ’s got it all worked out and so have I. ‘
206989	207000	206880	206880	I	2813	’ She screams , halting me dead in my tracks . ‘
207024	207032	207033	207033	You	2482	’ That threat foils my plan completely . ‘
207056	207057	207058	207058	Lauren	204	’ ‘
207060	207075	207058	207058	Lauren	204	’ he grates in warning . She laughs , a sly , delighted laugh . ‘
207096	207115	207058	207058	Lauren	204	’ He ’s moving fast now , nothing will stop him , and I know it ’s because I ’m
207222	207230	207231	207231	he	2485	‘ I did n’t kill our daughter ! ’
207251	207269	207231	207231	he	2485	‘ You did . The moment she got in that car you sent her to her death . ’
207270	207277	207278	207278	He	2485	‘ It was n’t my fault ! ’
207290	207365	207366	207366	Jesse	306	‘ Carmichael should never have taken our daughter . You should ’ve been watching her ! I spent five years in a padded cell . I ’ve spent twenty years wishing I ’d never let you see her . You left me without you , then you killed the only piece of you that I had left ! I ’ll never let you replace her ! No one else gets a piece of you ! ’
207385	207420	207424	207424	I	2813	’m scrambling into a sitting position , watching his whole body convulsing with exhaustion and anger . I heard and fully comprehended every single word that they just shouted at each other , and I ’m
207425	207548	207424	207424	I	2813	’m more sad than anything else . Every tiny little piece of pure craziness I have endured since meeting this man has just been justified . All of his overprotectiveness , unreasonable worry , and neurotic behaviour have just been explained . He does n’t think he deserves happiness , and he has been protecting me . But he ’s been protecting me from himself and the darkness of his history . It was n’t him in that car with Carmichael . It was his daughter . All of the people he has truly loved throughout his life have died tragically , and he thinks he is responsible for each and every one of them . My heart bleeds for this man . ‘
207554	207580	207424	207424	I	2813	’ I sob , trying to stand , but not making it past my knees . He thought this would but it wo n’t . I ’m

207623	207636	207597	207597	He	222	’ His chin is trembling as he starts to walk towards me . ‘
207642	207647	207597	207597	He	222	’ I assure him . ‘
207651	207783	207597	207597	He	222	’ I hold my arms out to him , desperate for him to know that I accept him and his history , no matter how shocking and dark it might be . A sense of serenity travels between our bodies , like a silent , mutual understanding as I wait for him to get to me . My impatience is growing . He ’s taking too long , seeming to get slower and slower with each step he takes until he collapses to his knee on a strangled gasp and clenches his stomach on a hiss . My confused eyes search his face for some clue of what is wrong , but then he pulls his jacket back , revealing a blood soaked shirt and the knife submerged in his side . ‘
207786	207815	207819	207819	Jesse	306	’ I scream , finding my feet and rushing to his side . My hand hovers over the handle of the knife , not knowing what to do . ‘
207821	207838	207819	207819	Jesse	306	’ He falls back , choking , his palm patting at his wound around the blade . ‘
207851	207876	207819	207819	Jesse	306	’ I collapse to my knees , all searing pain in my stomach and across my face being shifted straight to my chest . I ’m
207901	207910	207895	207895	His	306	‘ Do n’t close your eyes , Jesse . ’
207916	207928	207929	207929	He	306	‘ Baby , keep your eyes open . Look at me . ’
207963	207966	207949	207949	I	2813	‘ Ava … ’
207967	207970	207971	207971	I	2813	‘ Shhh , ’
208010	208098	208099	208099	Jesse	306	’m screaming down the phone , shouting instructions and begging the woman on the other end to hurry . She tries to calm me down , she tries to give me instructions , but I ca n’t hear her . I hang up , too distracted by Jesse ’s paling face . He looks grey , his body is completely limp and his dry lips are parted , wheezing in shallow breaths . His laboured breathing does n’t blank out the eerie silence surrounding us , though . ‘
208105	208109	208099	208099	Jesse	306	’ I yell . ‘
208127	208128	208129	208129	I	2813	’ ‘
208133	208142	208143	208143	Jesse	306	’ His body jerks as his eyes close . ‘
208145	208269	208143	208143	Jesse	306	’ He opens again and his arm tries in vain to lift , but he gives up , letting it flop back down to the floor . I ca n’t stand the sound of him struggling to breathe , so I grab his phone and dial my mobile , hearing Angel start from a few feet away . I rock him , unable to control my sobbing . Every time my phone stops , I dial again , repeating over and over and over , the sound of his track dulling down the sound of his raspy wheezes . He ’s staring blankly up at me . There ’s nothing in his eyes . I search for anything , but there ’s nothing . ‘
208272	208290	208291	208291	Jesse	306	’ he murmurs , his eyes getting heavy until he loses the battle to keep them open . ‘
208299	208307	208291	208291	Jesse	306	’ I desperately try to part them . ‘
208310	208320	208291	208291	Jesse	306	’ I scream the word at him , but I ’m
208326	208396	208325	208325	I	2813	’m losing him . And I know this because my own heart in slowing , too . Chapter 33 I have n’t looked into those eyes for two weeks . It ’s been the longest two weeks of my life . Any notions of desolation or misery that have come before this point in my life have been trampled all over by the feelings crippling me right now . I ’m
208400	208404	208399	208399	I	2813	’m helpless . I ’m
208556	208747	208555	208555	I	2813	’m used to it already , the imperfection a horrid reminder of the worse day of my life , but now another part of him to love . I ’ve not once left his bedside . I ’ve showered in seconds when my mum physically put me in there , but each time I ’ve made her swear to scream if he stirs . He has n’t . I ’ve been told each day by the same doctor and surgeon that it ’s a waiting game . He ’s strong and he ’s healthy , so he has the best chance , but I ca n’t see an improvement since they left him to breathe on his own . Not one hour passes without me begging him to wake up . Not a minute passes without me kissing him somewhere , hoping the feel of my lips on his skin will spark something . It has n’t . Each day , my heart slows more , my eyes become sorer and my tummy is growing larger . Each time I take a split second to look down at myself , I ’m
208769	208773	208774	208774	I	2813	‘ Wake up . ’
208785	208790	208774	208774	I	2813	‘ You stubborn man ! ’
208807	208817	208818	208818	She	2774	‘ Why wo n’t he wake up , Mum ? ’
208839	208851	208818	208818	She	2774	‘ He ’s healing , darling . He needs to heal . ’
208852	208870	208871	208871	My	2813	‘ It ’s been too long . I need him to wake up . I miss him . ’
208886	208891	208871	208871	My	2813	‘ Oh , Ava . ’
208913	208918	208919	208919	Ava	536	’m in desolation myself . ‘
208928	208941	208919	208919	Ava	536	’ she says softly , encouraging me to lift from the bed . ‘

208949	208953	208954	208954	I	2813	’m not hungry . ’

208986	209041	209042	209042	Beatrice	3515	’ she threatens , her own voice quivering as she presents me with a light boxed salad . I know I ’ll get nowhere refusing this , but the silly notion that eating will please him is the only reason I open the box with one hand and start picking at the cherry tomatoes . ‘

And he ’s touching me now , his big palm circling my messy , naturally dried hair , but in my dream I look perfect , not tired , pale and scruffy in my lounge pants and one of his worn t - shirts , the one that I told my mum to retrieve from the laundry basket and which I ’ve not replaced in all the time I ’ve been here . I ’m
211225	211232	211233	211233	I	2813	‘ My beautiful girl is dreaming . ’
211352	211464	211351	211351	I	2813	’m disorientated and wincing at the screaming noise , which I soon realise is his drip , shouting that he ’s out of fluids . Pulling myself up , I reach up to call the nurse , but jump when I hear a muffled moan . I do n’t know why I jump , it ’s low and quiet , not at all fright worthy , but my heart is racing , anyway . I watch his face closely , thinking that perhaps I ’ve imagined it . But then his eyes move under his lids and my heart rate increases further . I want to pinch myself to ensure that I ’m
211494	211497	211498	211498	I	2813	‘ Jesse ? ’
211544	211547	211539	211539	He	2813	‘ Jesse ? ’
211581	211584	211585	211585	Jesse	306	’m not . ‘
211587	211594	211585	211585	Jesse	306	’ I shake a little more . ‘
211598	211634	211635	211635	Jesse	306	’ he complains , his voice broken and dry , his eyes going from relaxed closed to clenched closed . I reach over him and punch the button on the machine to shut it up . ‘

211641	211676	211635	211635	Jesse	306	’ he grumbles irritably , lifting his hand to clench his head . Every fear and grief stricken emotion flows freely from my body and light engulfs me . Bright light . Hopeful light . ‘
211681	211685	211635	211635	Jesse	306	’ I demand . ‘
211692	211693	211695	211695	God	306	’ ‘
211697	211722	211695	211695	God	306	’ My relief is incredible , almost painful , as it courses like lightening through my depleted body , bringing me back to life . ‘
211725	211810	211695	211695	God	306	’ I beg . I need to see his eyes . He groans some more , and I can see him struggling to follow through on my unreasonable order . I do n’t relent , doing the kind thing of telling him to stop . I need to see his eyes . And there they are . Not as green or addictive , but they have life in them and they are squinting , adjusting to the subtle glow of light in the room . ‘
211814	211853	211695	211695	God	306	’ I ’ve never been so pleased to hear two words . It ’s Jesse and it ’s familiar . I stupidly dive on him , kissing his bearded face and only stop when he hisses in pain . ‘

211875	211886	211873	211873	Ava	536	’ His face screws up , his eyes closing again . ‘

211907	211918	211919	211919	I	2813	‘ Then stop fucking inflicting pain on me , woman ! ’

211978	211998	211999	211999	Baby	88	’m sobbing again as overpowering relief takes hold and my cheeks fall into palms to conceal my wrecked face . ‘
212016	212031	212010	212010	I	2813	’ I hear his shifting body , followed by a string of bad language . ‘

212039	212118	212119	212119	She	88	’ I scorn him , wiping my sniffling face before pushing lightly on his shoulders . He does n’t argue with me . He relaxes back into his pillow on an exhausted sigh , then lifts his arm and focuses on the needle hanging out , before taking a confused glance around at all of the machinery surrounding him . I see understanding settle across his face and his head whips up , his eyes wide and frightened . ‘
212123	212139	212140	212141	The babies	3585	’ he blurts , struggling to sit up , hissing and wincing as he does . ‘
212143	212144	212145	212145	We	3585	’ ‘
212146	212149	212150	212150	I	2813	’re okay , ’

212581	212585	212586	212586	I	2813	’ he sighs . ‘
212593	212601	212586	212586	I	2813	’ Those few words make me tense . ‘

212660	212676	212659	212659	I	2813	’m the one who relents , more concerned for him than he is for himself . ‘
212683	212688	212689	212689	You	2543	’ he demands harshly . ‘
212690	212702	212703	212703	Rosie	206	’re not going anywhere until I ’ve told you about Rosie . ’

212762	212798	212799	212799	I	2813	’m about to get the whole story . Not just the bits that I ’d like to hear about his daughter , but the parts about the psychotic woman who nearly robbed him from me . ‘
212800	212858	212859	212859	He	2813	’m sure you can imagine the type — well - bred , rich and highly respected in the snotty community that we were forced to tolerate . We fooled around once and she ended up pregnant . We were seventeen , young and stupid . Can you imagine the scandal ? I‘d really done it this time . ’
212868	212922	212859	212859	He	2813	‘ Emergency meetings were called between Lauren ’s family and my own , and her father demanded I marry her before word got out and ruined both of our families . Jake had not long died and I went along with it , hoping my compliance might build some bridges with my parents . ’
212960	212965	212966	212966	I	2813	‘ An arranged marriage ? ’
212969	212994	212966	212966	I	2813	‘ Yes , but the joint effort of both families did an amazing job of convincing the community that we were hopelessly in love . ’
212995	212999	213000	213000	I	2813	‘ She was . ’
213013	213019	213020	213020	he	2813	‘ And I was n’t . ’
213024	213034	213020	213020	he	2813	‘ I was married off and moved into her parents ’
213048	213066	213067	213067	Carmichael	323	’ His fingers play idly with my hair , and he draws a painful breath before continuing . ‘
213142	213169	213137	213137	she	2551	’ All of this is filling me with immense proudness , but this story does n’t have a happily ever after . And it crushes me . ‘
213178	213183	213170	213170	She	2551	’ he says fondly . ‘
213279	213280	213272	213272	I	2813	’ ‘
213291	213305	213272	213272	I	2813	’ I ask . He jerks on a hiss as he laughs quietly . ‘

213325	213329	213321	213321	They	2558	’ I whisper . ‘

213454	213484	213485	213485	Sarah	60	’m scrambling with care from his hold now , but this time he lets me . He is chewing that lip and he ’s holding his breath , too . ‘
213497	213498	213499	213499	He	2813	’ ‘
213506	213513	213515	213516	a child	1251	’ he flinches as he inhales . ‘

213575	213595	213571	213571	I	2813	‘ Carmichael walked in on me and Sarah . He hit the roof , got the girls and left . ’
213600	213604	213605	213605	I	2813	‘ The girls ? ’
213621	213626	213614	213614	I	2813	‘ Rosie and Rebecca . ’
213627	213634	213635	213635	I	2813	‘ Your Rosie and their Rebecca . ’
213638	213643	213644	213644	He	2813	‘ The car accident ? ’
213653	213673	213644	213644	He	2813	‘ I did n’t just kill my uncle and my daughter . I killed Sarah ’s girl , too . ’
213674	213677	213678	213678	I	2813	‘ No , ’
213683	213691	213678	213678	I	2813	‘ That ca n’t be your fault . ’
213692	213762	213644	213644	He	2813	‘ I think you ’ll find that my poor decisions have been the cause for everything , Ava . I ’ve fucked up on so many levels so many times , and I ’ve paid for it , but I ca n’t pay for it now that I have you . What if I make a bad decision again ? What if I screw up again ? What if I ’m
213767	213952	213953	213953	You	2564	’ His demand for compliance on everything is crystal clear . Too clear . He really does live in terror , but it ’s far worse than I ever imagined . He blames himself for everything , and maybe his carelessness played a small part , but ultimately , he ’s not responsible . He was n’t driving the car that hit Jake . He was n’t driving the car with the girls . He did n’t want to get married and he definitely wanted to be a proper father . And Sarah ? That has totally floored me . She had a child with Carmichael , but was in love with her boyfriend ’s nephew ? Fucking hell , this is complicated stuff . Sarah really does have nothing and after losing both her daughter and her lover . She sought solace in The Manor , a little bit like Jesse did . Two tortured souls drowning themselves in whips , sex , and drink , but never in each other . That was Jesse ’s choice , though . Not Sarah ’s . ‘
213960	213996	213953	213953	You	2564	’ My eyes land on his stomach . He ’s paid physically and mentally , and it ’s made my husband a neurotic control freak now he has something he cares about again . Me . ‘

214114	214120	214087	214087	She	206	‘ And she stabbed you ? ’

214165	214176	214177	214177	I	2813	‘ But look at the mess she made of you . ’
214184	214192	214177	214177	I	2813	‘ How did you pass that off ? ’
214193	214207	214208	214208	He	2567	‘ It ’s pretty superficial . She did a better job this time . ’
214215	214227	214228	214228	I	2813	‘ You did n’t even go to hospital , did you ? ’
214229	214242	214228	214228	I	2813	’m horrified . That is one nasty scar and far from superficial . ‘

I ’ll get him something and force feed him if he refuses to eat it . His mood and my affronted state goes nowhere near to dampening down the elation dancing through me .

And whilst I might be taking a huge risk , I know it will be my only opportunity to get them in the same room together . He will have to listen . If he does n’t like what her hears , then so be it , but I ’ve watched his family grieving . I saw it clearly , even through my own grief . Now is the time to put all wrongs right , no matter who is to blame . This is what I hope , but it ’s his choice , and I ’ll stick by whatever he decides . ‘

He refused the wheelchair that was delivered to his room , which I was n’t surprised about at all . My big , strapping man had been laid up for three weeks , dependant on others to care for him , so I could n’t deny him the dignity of walking out of the hospital , even if it took us an hour . We returned to Lusso , where Cathy fussed and flapped around like a mother hen , ensuring cupboards were full , washing was done and the whole place looked like it did on the launch night before it had been lived in . Then I gave her a few weeks off . We needed privacy in our home . I needed to look after Jesse . I needed to nurse him back to the man who I know and love . The first week was a washout . Streams of constant visitors plagued the penthouse , including Jesse ’s parents . It ’s still odd and a little strained , but I can see a light in my husband ’s eyes that I never have before . It ’s different to the sparkle of lust or the deepening in anger . This is peace . The police paid numerous visits during that first week . It was probably too soon , but Jesse insisted on getting the chore out of the way so we could resume our normal . Patrick stopped by with my work colleagues , expressing his sincere apologies for putting me in such an awful situation , but he was n’t to know , and neither was poor Sal . She ’s well and truly back to dreary , plaid skirt wearing Sal , but she seemed happy enough . Mikael withdrew from the deal to buy Rococo Union and Patrick offered me my job back , but I politely declined and Jesse did n’t try to convince me otherwise . I ca n’t return to work , and I really do n’t want to . For the following three weeks after that first hectic one , there was constant contact , just how he likes it . We bathed every morning and indulged in hours of tub - talk . I re - dressed his wound , he rubbed Bio Oil into my tummy . I cooked breakfast , he fed it to us , both naked . He read his pregnancy manual out loud , I listened intently . He chose to skim past the parts that would put his ridiculous worries to rest , and I chose to snatch the book from his hand and read those parts aloud to him . He would scowl , I would grin . He wanted lots of sex , but I did n’t want to hurt him , which is ironic after the constant battle we ’ve had in this aspect of our relationship since I ’ve been pregnant . It ’s been hard . My raging hormones are not improving . Now , four weeks later , I ’m
219869	219873	219868	219868	I	2813	’m naked and I ’m
219885	219888	219889	219889	My	2813	‘ Comfy ? ’
219921	219933	219940	219940	he	222	‘ No , because you are not in here with me . ’
219990	219998	219960	219960	He	222	‘ Good morning , my beautiful girl . ’
219999	220003	220004	220004	My	2813	‘ Good morning . ’
220024	220031	220013	220013	I	2813	‘ What are we doing today ? ’
220032	220040	220041	220041	he	222	‘ I have it all planned out . ’
220049	220055	220041	220041	he	222	‘ You will do what you ’re

220065	220096	220013	220013	I	2813	’ I enquire casually , but far too hopefully . I ’ll ensure that I lose this time , so there will be no need for the transfer of power . ‘
220099	220101	220013	220013	I	2813	’ I ’m
220104	220112	220113	220113	I	2813	‘ Does it involve twilight sleepy sex ? ’
220126	220130	220115	220115	him	222	‘ Maybe later . ’
220131	220140	220141	220141	I	2813	‘ Then I ’ll do whatever you want . ’
220172	220182	220183	220183	He	222	‘ Your day starts right now , Mrs Ward . ’
220212	220215	220200	220200	He	222	‘ Here . ’
220216	220221	220222	220222	I	2813	‘ What ’s this ? ’
220243	220248	220249	220249	he	222	‘ Just open it . ’
220273	220375	220376	220376	You	2650	’m not sure that I want to open it , but curiosity is drowning my apprehension , so I slowly pull it open , flicking eyes back and forth between Jesse and the envelope . Slowly pulling out the piece of paper , I unfold and read the first line . Haskett and Sandler property management . That means nothing to me . I read on , but I ca n’t make head nor tail of the legal lingo . I can make sense of the obscene amount of numbers that follow the pound sign halfway down the page , though . ‘
220382	220409	220376	220376	You	2650	’ I blurt , looking over the paper at him . I say house but judging by the figure , which I now notice has the words ‘
220414	220432	220376	220376	You	2650	’ written next to it , it could be a palace … or maybe even a castle . ‘
220441	220467	220435	220435	I	2813	’ The lip biting has just sprung into the realms of cannibalism . He ’s chomping furiously as he gages my reaction to that statement . ‘

220497	220506	220507	220507	I	2813	’m being pushed back down to the bed . ‘
220513	220531	220507	220507	I	2813	’ He lays down over me and clasps the sides of my face in his bag palms . ‘
220538	220579	220589	220589	I	2813	’ I do n’t understand . I planted the seed , I know , but I never expected him to take a bit of notice . He smiles down at me and lowers his lips to mine , teasingly . I ’m
220590	220630	220589	220589	I	2813	’m also desperate , as always , for his magic mouth . I drop the document and fall straight into the rhythm he ’s set , finding his big shoulders and feeling my way up to his jaw . I ’m
220664	220673	220674	220674	He	2653	‘ Hmmm , you taste heavenly , lady . ’
220690	220693	220694	220694	I	2813	‘ Why ? ’
220712	220733	220734	220734	You	2656	’m not letting go until he spills . He gazes at me thoughtfully for a few moments before drawing breath . ‘
220738	220749	220737	220737	you	2656	’re a kid ? At primary school , I mean . ’
220750	220753	220754	220754	I	2813	‘ Yeah , ’
220768	220771	220772	220772	he	2653	‘ Well … ’
220775	220800	220772	220772	he	2653	‘ What the hell would I do if the babies asked me to go in for one of those open days these schools have ? ’
220801	220805	220772	220772	he	2653	‘ Open day ? ’

220830	220850	220824	220828	a fireman or a copper	2657	’ I squeeze my lips together , desperate not to laugh at him when it ’s clearly a worry . ‘
220856	220861	220853	220853	I	2813	’ he asks seriously . ‘
220867	220875	220862	220862	You	2813	’re The Sex Lord of The Manor . ’
220882	220901	220881	220881	I	2813	’m laughing . God love this man . My fast disappearing hipbone is grasped and my laughter increases . ‘

220967	221032	221033	221033	I	2813	’m trying to give him an out . This , obviously , has always been a concern , but I never pushed it because I know what that big country estate means to him . He rolls onto his back , and I quickly resume position and sit myself on him . He grasps the tops of my thighs and looks up at me . ‘
221040	221046	221033	221033	I	2813	’ He ’s really adamant . ‘

221240	221254	221235	221235	I	2813	‘ What about John and Mario ? And Sarah ? What about Sarah ? ’
221285	221312	221279	221279	John	2813	‘ I ’ve spoken to them . Sarah ’s taking up an opportunity is the US and John and Mario are more than ready for retirement . ’
221313	221316	221317	221317	I	2813	‘ Oh , ’
221349	221362	221363	221363	He	2671	‘ And will the members re - new under the new owners ? ’
221366	221375	221363	221363	He	2671	‘ Yes , if they like playing golf . ’
221376	221379	221363	221363	He	2671	‘ Golf ? ’
221380	221393	221363	221363	He	2671	‘ The grounds are being converted into an eighteen hole golf course . ’

221743	221777	221742	221742	we	2680	’re not going anywhere public . I watch him kneel for me to step into the dress , and he secures me before standing back and clasping his chin in his hand thoughtfully . ‘
221780	221802	221803	221803	I	2813	’ He nods in approval and takes my hand , leading me to the double doors that lead to the veranda . ‘

222090	222114	222047	222047	You	2682	’ I start to run down to the shore , but as soon as my head lifts from my feet to look where I ’m

222223	222233	222222	222222	I	2813	’m suddenly considering the possibility of him announcing that we ’re

222521	222525	222520	222520	I	2813	’m done . I ’m
222558	222630	222631	222631	I	2813	’m supposed to do . Despite everything , I entrust myself to this man . He leads the way and I follow . Because I know it ’s where I belong . When it ’s his turn to speak , the registrar steps away and Jesse moves in closer , lifting both of my hands with his and resting his lips on them , leaving them lingering for the longest time . ‘
222635	222649	222631	222631	I	2813	’ he whispers , stroking his thumbs where his lips have just left . ‘
222714	222722	222723	222723	He	222	’m taking you to Paradise , baby . ’
222745	222750	222739	222739	him	222	‘ Are you ready ? ’

222773	222794	222795	222795	He	222	‘ Oh , I took you long ago , Mrs Ward . But right now is where it really begins . ’
222800	222829	222795	222795	He	222	‘ No more digging to get beneath me . You know everything there so to know . And no more confessions because I have nothing left to tell . ’
222830	222836	222837	222837	I	2813	‘ I think you have . ’

This is us . This will be our normal forever and ever , no more shocking discoveries and no more confessions . His two perfect mars on his insanely perfect stomach are a constant reminder of our journey together , but the relentless gleam of happiness in his shockingly green eyes is a continuous reminder that I still have this man . And I always will . The End . Epilogue Fuck me , how long have I got to endure my home being bombarded and my wife and babies being hogged ? Too fucking long , that ’s how long . Hours , probably . I should snatch their gifts and throw them a piece of cake before shutting the door in their face . I smile on the inside , picturing Elizabeth ’s face if I did exactly that . This is going to be painful , and to rub salt into my moody wounds , we have school friends this year , too . And their mothers — lots of women , who have taken Ava up on her offer to stay , if they would like to . And , of course , they would like to . My stroppy feet are pounding down the staircase of our lovely little Manor , as I button up my shirt and chew my lip , thinking of any excuse to avoid this . I come up with nothing . My babies are five years old today , and not even daddy ’s amazing negotiation tactics will convince them that a party is a bad idea — not now they have their own mind . I ’ve tried for the last four years and fallen flat on my face , but only because my beautiful wife always intervened on their behalf . I know this year , though , if I got them alone , I could break them down with something . Skiing again , perhaps ? Hitting the bottom of the stairs , I take a quick glimpse in the mirror and smile . I get better looking every day . I ’ve still got it , and she still ca n’t resist me . Life is fucking good . ‘
223391	223425	223428	223429	birthday boy	128	’ I spin around , and my hard muscles liquefy as I watch my baby boy running down the stairs , his dark blonde hair a tousled mess around his handsome little face . ‘

223601	223646	223600	223600	I	2813	’m swiftly reminded that my dear mother - in - law does , in fact , live ten minutes away . The beauty of Newquay could n’t keep Elizabeth and Joseph away from their grandchildren — or my babies , more to the point . ‘
223653	223666	223649	223649	I	2813	’ I go for subject change , or distraction tactics — whichever . ‘

I halt at the doorway and spend a few moments drinking in the sight of my angel , frantically stirring a big mixing bowl of some brown shit , the curve of her perfect arse holding me rapt . Fucking perfect . My little man does n’t pester me to push onwards . He just sits happily on my shoulders , waiting for his spellbound father to snap back into action . He ’s used to me daydreaming , especially when his mother is around .
