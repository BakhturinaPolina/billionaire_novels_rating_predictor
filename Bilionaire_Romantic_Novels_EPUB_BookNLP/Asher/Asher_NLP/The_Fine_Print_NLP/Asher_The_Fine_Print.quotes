409	423	359	360	The man	199	“ Relax . That ’s the kind of thing people say at funerals . ”
435	446	359	360	The man	199	“ I do n’t need an excuse for my behavior . ”
447	464	359	360	The man	199	“ No , but you need a reason for scaring off our biggest Shanghai hotel investor . ”
465	468	359	360	The man	199	“ Fuck . ”
490	511	359	360	The man	199	“ Can you try to be nicer for one more hour ? At least until all the important people leave ? ”
512	518	519	519	My	199	“ This is me trying . ”
530	539	540	540	Cal	46	“ Well , do better . For him . ”
703	713	697	697	I	199	“ He would have hated this kind of show . ”
760	772	757	757	Cal	46	“ He of all people knew what was expected of him . ”
773	782	757	757	Cal	46	“ A networking event disguised as a funeral ? ”
802	822	786	786	Cal	46	“ You ’re right . Grandpa would be horrified because he always said Sunday was a day of rest . ”
823	832	786	786	Cal	46	“ There ’s no rest for the wicked . ”
833	841	842	842	Declan	572	“ And even less for the wealthy . ”
1051	1070	1042	1042	he	229	“ I wanted to offer my condolences . I ’m very sorry for your loss . Your grandfather — ”

1719	1722	1723	1723	I	199	“ happiness , ”
2202	2208	2209	2209	I	199	“ This is utter bullshit . ”

2246	2255	2256	2256	Cal	46	“ He ca n’t demand this of us . ”
2273	2297	2265	2265	Declan	572	“ You heard the lawyer . We either go along with it , or my ability to become CEO is null and void . ”
2308	2317	2298	2298	Cal	46	“ Fuck ! I ca n’t do it . ”
2318	2332	2333	2333	Declan	572	“ What could possibly be worse than losing your percentage of the company ? ”
2340	2345	2298	2298	Cal	46	“ Losing my dignity ? ”
2354	2359	2346	2346	I	199	“ That still exists ? ”
2380	2413	2365	2365	Declan	572	“ If there ’s anyone who has a right to be pissed , it ’s me . I ’m the one who needs to marry someone and impregnate them to become CEO . ”
2414	2437	2438	2438	Cal	46	“ You know babies are created by having sex , right ? Is that something your internal software is capable of learning ? ”
2484	2506	2471	2471	Cal	46	“ Alana ? Interesting . Wonder why Grandpa thought it would be a good idea for you both to reunite again . ”
2551	2563	2564	2564	Cal	46	“ Fuck off . And do n’t speak about her again , ”
2567	2582	2583	2583	Declan	572	“ If you want to play with fire , then prepare to be cremated . ”
2599	2630	2590	2590	His	572	“ Regardless of our personal thoughts on the matter , we do n’t have a choice but to proceed with Grandpa ’s terms . There ’s too much at stake . ”
3018	3044	3013	3013	Joyce	58	“ All right , everyone . Let ’s get started . We have a lot to cover and little time before the first guests arrive . ”
3351	3357	3358	3358	Her	289	“ Hi . Excuse me . ”
3612	3618	3597	3597	She	289	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
3664	3683	3655	3658	Some older crew member	295	“ Do you mind taking a seat already ? I can barely hear Joyce over your usual racket . ”
3696	3701	3702	3702	she	289	“ Right . Yes , ”
3830	3835	3836	3836	I	199	“ Do you mind ? ”
3840	3843	3844	3844	She	289	“ Sorry ! ”
3915	3921	3922	3923	The man	199	“ Come on , Zahra . ”
3950	3955	3956	3956	she	289	“ Sorry , Ralph , ”
3959	3970	3936	3936	Her	289	“ Stop being sorry and start being early for once . ”
4007	4026	3993	3993	She	289	“ Can I make it up to you with fresh bread that Claire and I made last night ? ”
4046	4064	4043	4043	Ralph	60	“ Throw in some cookies and I wo n’t complain to Joyce about you being late again . ”
4076	4102	4103	4103	She	289	“ I knew you had a soft spot for me . People say you ’re mean but I do n’t believe a word of it . ”
4186	4204	4175	4175	Ralph	60	“ Do n’t let anyone in on our secret . I could n’t handle the fall out . ”
4205	4214	4215	4215	She	289	“ Of course . I would n’t dare . ”
4322	4336	4315	4315	I	199	“ Are you done ? Some of us are trying to pay attention . ”
4359	4364	4365	4365	she	289	“ I ’m sorry , ”
4382	4414	4365	4365	she	289	“ Some big changes are happening at Corporate that we will be reviewing over the next week . They ’re going to be keeping a close eye on us this quarter . ”
4415	4423	4424	4424	Zahra	420	“ Great . Just what we need , ”
4436	4445	4446	4446	I	199	“ Do you have a problem with Corporate ? ”
4479	4493	4461	4461	She	420	“ The real question is who does n’t have a problem with Corporate . ”
4494	4497	4461	4461	She	420	“ Why ? ”
4498	4533	4461	4461	She	420	“ Because The Kane Company Board is filled with a bunch of old men who sit around talking about how much money they ’ve made , without actually discussing the important matters at hand . ”
4534	4548	4461	4461	She	420	“ And you ’re an expert on board meetings all of a sudden ? ”
4549	4567	4461	4461	She	420	“ It does n’t take a genius to draw conclusions based on how they treat us here . ”
4568	4574	4461	4461	She	420	“ And how ’s that ? ”
4575	4593	4461	4461	She	420	“ Like we do n’t matter as long as we make them billions of dollars a year . ”
4606	4615	4600	4600	she	420	“ Are n’t employees paid not to complain ? ”
4623	4651	4616	4616	She	420	“ Sorry , that ’ll cost the company extra , and seeing as most of us make minimum wage , silence is n’t part of the deal . ”
4665	4680	4681	4681	She	420	“ It should be if only to prevent you from spewing more ignorant statements . ”
4702	4716	4717	4717	Joyce	58	“ This next quarter is going to be different from the last one . ”
4731	4742	4743	4743	Zahra	420	“ Oh , come on . It ’s the truth . ”
4774	4781	4789	4789	man	304	“ You do n’t believe her ? ”
4819	4832	4833	4833	Her	420	“ Because nothing good can happen now that Brady ’s really gone . ”
4858	4880	4846	4846	she	420	“ The park has performed better in the last year alone than ever before , so I find your statement baseless . ”
4889	4924	4881	4881	Her	420	“ Not everything is about a bottom line . Sure , the park performed better , but at what expense ? Small wages ? Cheaper health insurance benefits for employees and unpaid vacation days ? ”
4990	5019	4978	4978	I	199	“ Spoken like someone who knows nothing about running a multibillion - dollar industry . Not that I ’m surprised . You do work here , after all . ”
5040	5048	5049	5049	I	199	“ What the hell was that for ? ”
5052	5077	5113	5113	She	420	“ I was trying to see if this was a nightmare . Turns out this whole train wreck of a conversation is very real . ”
5078	5091	5113	5113	She	420	“ Touch me again and you ’ll be fired on the spot . ”
5095	5106	5092	5092	She	420	“ Which department did you say you were from again ? ”
5107	5112	5113	5113	She	420	“ I did n’t . ”
5135	5143	5144	5144	I	199	“ What department do you work in ? ”
5168	5179	5147	5147	She	420	“ I ’m a beautician at The Magic Wand Salon . ”
5180	5197	5147	5147	She	420	“ Great . So at least you do n’t do anything important enough to be missed . ”
5207	5216	5204	5204	she	420	“ God , you ’re such an asshole . ”
5360	5368	5369	5369	Claire	420	“ What ’s got you all upset ? ”
5406	5427	5398	5398	she	420	“ I met the biggest jerk this morning during the meeting . And you wo n’t believe who it was . ”
5428	5432	5398	5398	she	420	“ Who ? ! ”
5433	5437	5398	5398	she	420	“ Rowan Kane . ”
5438	5444	5445	5446	My roommate	316	“ Get the fuck out ! ”
5474	5477	5478	5478	I	199	“ Claire . ”
5481	5491	5461	5462	Mrs. Jeffries	65	“ He ’s Dreamland royalty . Excuse my shock . ”
5492	5505	5469	5469	she	420	“ Trust me . Some things are better left to the imagination . ”
5652	5667	5646	5646	Claire	420	“ Well , tell me ! Does he smell as good as he looks ? ”
5668	5671	5646	5646	Claire	420	“ No . ”
5806	5830	5831	5831	She	296	“ Okay , let ’s ignore the fact that he ’s a jerk and talk more about if he ’s single or not . ”
5836	5848	5849	5849	I	199	“ Last time I checked , he is n’t your type . ”
5879	5891	5855	5855	she	296	“ Bitch , I ’m asking for you , not me . ”
5902	5932	5892	5892	I	199	“ Seeing as he told me that my job was n’t important enough to be missed , I ’m not interested . Not to mention he ’s our boss . ”
5974	5981	6014	6016	the salon manager	331	“ Man . What a dick . ”
5982	6006	6014	6016	the salon manager	331	“ Tell me about it . I ca n’t believe he ’s our new Director . It was so all of a sudd — ”
6007	6011	6012	6012	Regina	68	“ Roll call ! ”
6089	6092	6093	6093	Claire	420	“ Ready ? ”
6115	6121	6102	6102	I	199	“ I was born ready . ”
6177	6200	6165	6165	Henry	69	“ Hi , Zahra . This is Lily . She ’s excited to have you make her look like Princess Cara today . ”
6210	6219	6201	6201	I	199	“ Are you sure you need a makeover ? ”
6225	6236	6220	6220	She	70	“ Are you sure you ’re not a princess already ? ”
6268	6287	6262	6262	I	199	“ You ’re going to make my job so easy that my boss might think I have superpowers . ”
6304	6310	6311	6311	She	70	“ I like your pin . ”
6325	6329	6330	6330	I	199	“ Thank you . ”
6419	6422	6423	6423	She	70	“ Hey ! ”
6426	6430	6435	6435	Rowan	296	“ Oh God . ”
6431	6434	6435	6435	Rowan	296	“ What ? ”
6483	6497	6498	6498	Lily	70	“ Ohh , you ’re getting red . Mommy does that with Daddy . ”
6504	6507	6510	6510	he	199	“ Hmm . ”
6533	6539	6521	6521	Lily	70	“ Do you like him ? ”
6540	6545	6546	6546	I	199	“ Shh ! No ! ”
6554	6560	6561	6561	she	296	“ Is it a secret ? ”
6564	6567	6568	6568	I	199	“ Yes ! ”
6626	6640	6610	6610	Henry	69	“ So , care to share why Mr. Kane is asking about you ? ”
6641	6651	6610	6610	Henry	69	“ Because I might have made him angry earlier ? ”
6659	6680	6652	6652	Henry	69	“ I wanted to come over and warn you that he ’s asking Regina all kinds of questions about you . ”
6864	6870	6871	6871	Lily	70	“ Is he your prince ? ”
6886	6903	6881	6881	Henry	69	“ We ’ll have to wait and see if he carries her off to his kingdom . ”
6935	6946	6947	6947	Henry	69	“ Good luck ! You ’re going to need it . ”
7089	7094	7095	7095	I	199	“ You look beautiful . ”
7105	7109	7110	7110	She	70	“ Thank you . ”
7156	7182	7142	7142	I	199	“ You ’re one pretty lady . I bet someone is going to mistake you for the real Princess Cara the moment you leave here . ”
7183	7186	7187	7187	Her	70	“ Really ? ”
7198	7223	7193	7193	I	199	“ You bet . And I know kids are going to be jealous of your cool wheels when their feet are aching and sore . ”
7227	7232	7224	7224	She	70	“ You ’re funny . ”
7233	7251	7224	7224	She	70	“ If someone asks you for a free ride , make sure to charge them . Promise ? ”
7252	7256	7257	7257	She	70	“ Pinky promise . ”
7362	7400	7401	7401	She	370	“ Thank you so much for taking care of my daughter . She was scared she would n’t fit in here like the other girls but you went out of your way to make her day special . ”
7413	7436	7408	7408	I	199	“ It ’s my pleasure . But Lily made it easy because you both have one beautiful daughter , inside and out . ”
8200	8206	8195	8195	I	199	“ Let ’s get started . ”
8212	8281	8207	8207	They	396	“ I am expected to come up with a new plan for the park that identifies our weaknesses . Together we will evaluate the performance of Dreamland ’s attractions and determine how we can better serve our guests . That includes renovating current rides , creating new lands , updating skits and float parades that will increase Dreamland ’s ROI by five percent , at the very least . ”
8296	8335	8282	8282	Sam	74	“ Based on my preliminary analysis , our competitors have been growing fiercer over the years . And although Dreamland performs above average each quarter , I ’m looking to obliterate our competition and steal their profit margins . ”
8362	8407	8341	8341	Jenny	75	“ Projects like these take years to go from blueprints to live - action rides . That being said , I ’m expecting your two teams to develop the initial plans that I will then present in front of a board in six months . ”
8510	8514	8515	8515	Jenny	75	“ Six months ? ”
8525	8535	8536	8536	She	75	“ I assume that wo n’t be a problem . ”
8550	8619	8536	8536	She	75	“ I ’m looking to package this whole idea as a fiftieth - anniversary celebration and generate a buzz that pulls at people ’s heartstrings . The project should appeal to the new and old generations who grew up with Dreamland characters . I want it to emulate everything my grandfather loved about this park while also moving us toward a brighter — and more modern — future . ”
8642	8659	8726	8726	Jenny	75	“ So whatever needs to be done , do it . Time is not our friend . ”
8660	8666	8667	8667	Sam	74	“ What is our budget ? ”
8672	8698	8726	8726	Jenny	75	“ Keep it reasonable — so around ten billion for the entire park . If you need more , my accountants will review the numbers . ”
8706	8725	8726	8726	Jenny	75	“ I expect results . If not , then you ’re better off applying for the traveling carnival . ”
8739	8747	8748	8748	Jenny	75	“ Sir , may I speak freely ? ”
8766	8774	8761	8761	I	199	“ If you find it absolutely necessary . ”
8775	8815	8748	8748	Jenny	75	“ Based on your rapid timeline , I was wondering if we could open up the annual employee submissions early this year ? That way , the Creators could work with fresh ideas rather than starting from ground zero . ”
8905	8933	8897	8897	I	199	“ Open up the applications for two weeks only . I want you to personally review the submissions and deliver only the best ones to my desk . ”
8937	8956	8934	8934	Jenny	75	“ Of course . I ’m sure we have a good idea about what you ’re looking for . ”
8969	8974	8957	8957	Doubtful	76	“ Get to work . ”
8999	9002	8975	8975	Jenny	75	“ Son . ”
9059	9062	9048	9048	I	199	“ Father . ”
9078	9106	9107	9107	His	212	“ How ’s everything in Dreamland ? I assume you ’ll be attending our board meeting on Monday regardless of whatever plans you ’ve got going on . ”
9128	9134	9123	9123	My	199	“ Why do you care ? ”
9135	9154	9166	9166	he	212	“ Because I ’m intrigued by your sudden interest in becoming the Director after your grandfather ’s passing . ”
9183	9193	9194	9194	I	199	“ Is there a purpose to this phone call ? ”
9201	9226	9156	9156	he	212	“ I was curious about your progress after reviewing the funding request you put in . Ten billion dollars is n’t a joking matter . ”
9235	9243	9156	9156	he	212	“ I do n’t need your advice . ”
9244	9253	9194	9194	I	199	“ Good . I was n’t offering it . ”
9254	9269	9156	9156	he	212	“ God forbid you acted like a father for once in your pathetic life . ”
9270	9279	9194	9194	I	199	“ Interesting word choice from my weakest son . ”
9351	9370	9371	9371	I	199	“ I ’ve got to go . I have a meeting that I ca n’t be late for . ”
9468	9474	9454	9455	Zahra Claire	420	“ This is your chance ! ”
9475	9479	9480	9480	She	420	“ What is ? ”
9509	9516	9496	9496	I	199	“ No way . Not happening . ”
9517	9522	9480	9480	She	420	“ Hear me out — ”
9523	9526	9496	9496	I	199	“ No . ”
9527	9555	9556	9556	She	420	“ Yes ! You ’re going to listen to my argument without interrupting me . You owe me that much as your best friend and personal chef . ”
9568	9581	9604	9604	She	420	“ My stomach might love you but my thighs sure do n’t . ”
9593	9603	9588	9588	I	199	“ Fine . I ’ll give you a chance . ”
9610	9633	9604	9604	She	420	“ Okay , so I get why you ’re hesitant . I ’d be too if someone betrayed me like Lance did . ”
9634	9644	9604	9604	She	420	“ Do we really need to bring up Lance ? ”
9672	9695	9696	9696	She	420	“ The only reason I ’m mentioning him is because this is the final step in the process of letting him go . ”
9710	9717	9696	9696	She	420	“ I ’ve moved on already . ”
9718	9749	9750	9750	He	422	“ I know you have , but there ’s still a tiny part of you that is afraid of chasing after the dreams he stole right out of your hands . ”
9763	9772	9759	9759	My	199	“ I do n’t dream about inventing anymore . ”
9773	9802	9696	9696	She	420	“ The bullshit he said about your skills was only a diversion to keep you from submitting the same idea as him . You know that , right ? ”
9803	9806	9759	9759	My	199	“ But — ”
9807	9829	9696	9696	She	420	“ But nothing . Lance lied because he wanted to hold you back long enough for him to steal your idea . ”
9853	9876	9843	9843	Claire	420	“ This is your chance to prove to yourself that nothing anyone says defines who you are . Only your actions do . ”
9881	9887	9877	9877	My	199	“ I ’m not sure … ”
9893	9916	9888	9888	She	420	“ Come on . Just submit one teensy little project . That ’s all . What ’s the worst that can happen ? ”
9917	9928	9929	9929	Claire	420	“ Well , where should I start ? I mean — ”
9937	9944	9929	9929	Claire	420	“ It was a rhetorical question ! ”
9950	9961	9945	9945	I	199	“ Why are you pushing me so hard to apply ? ”
9962	9990	10013	10013	I	199	“ Because that ’s what friends are for . We need to push each other out of our comfort zones . Because if you ’re not afraid — ”
9991	9998	9999	9999	I	199	“ Then you ’re not growing . ”
10005	10012	10013	10013	I	199	“ So what do you say ? ”
10030	10060	10061	10061	I	199	“ Speaking of comfort zones … I wanted to bring this up to you , and now seems like the perfect time . Because if you ’re not afraid … ”
10064	10068	10013	10013	I	199	“ Oh no . ”
10073	10110	10069	10069	My	199	“ If I ’m submitting a proposal , then you ’re applying for the apprentice position at The Royal Chateau . They have an opening in the kitchen that has your name written all over it . ”
10116	10126	10111	10111	Claire	420	“ This was n’t supposed to be about me . ”
10127	10150	10184	10184	she	420	“ We ’re a duo . If I ’m pushing myself to my limit , then you ’re coming along with me . ”
10190	10203	10111	10111	Claire	420	“ I ca n’t apply there . They have a Michelin star ! ”
10204	10216	10265	10265	She	420	“ All the more reason to apply to the very best . ”
10217	10232	10233	10233	She	420	“ But I do n’t have a culinary degree from some fancy French school ! ”
10243	10264	10265	10265	She	420	“ No , but you have a degree and heaps of experience working at restaurants during high school and college . ”
10273	10283	10265	10265	She	420	“ Last week I burnt a batch of cookies . ”
10284	10294	10295	10295	I	199	“ Only because I forgot to set the timer . ”
10298	10325	10265	10265	She	420	“ The entire building had to evacuate because of the fire alarm . There ’s no way anyone would trust me in a kitchen after that . ”
10329	10336	10326	10326	I	199	“ Do n’t be so dramatic . ”
10350	10359	10337	10337	She	420	“ You were n’t supposed to blackmail me . ”
10360	10366	10337	10337	She	420	“ What are friends for ? ”
10367	10379	10337	10337	She	420	“ Oh , I do n’t know , anything but felonies ? ”
10383	10392	10380	10380	I	199	“ Come on . What do you say ? ”
10393	10413	10337	10337	She	420	“ I say you ’re annoyingly chirpy for someone who was against this whole idea only five minutes ago . ”
10414	10423	10380	10380	I	199	“ I ’m taking advantage of an opportunity . ”
10424	10453	10337	10337	She	420	“ Just so you ’re aware , I ’m only agreeing because I ’m okay with being rejected if it means seeing you chase after your dreams again . ”
10458	10501	10454	10454	My	199	“ Sure thing . Just like I will only agree to your plan because I ’d rather see you try again . If not , you ’ll end up like Mrs. Jeffries , working at the salon until you retire at ninety . ”
10506	10515	10502	10502	Her	424	“ Now you ’re just being intentionally cruel . ”
11112	11116	11132	11132	Claire	420	“ Oh no ! ”
11124	11131	11132	11132	Claire	420	“ Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuuuuck ! ”
11138	11143	11132	11132	Claire	420	“ What is it ? ”
11199	11226	11190	11190	Claire	420	“ You submitted it without asking me to double - check for typos ? Who are you and what have you done with the real Zahra ? ”
11227	11233	11234	11234	I	199	“ It was an accident ! ”
11256	11280	11250	11250	Claire	420	“ What if you send an email to Mr. Kane and the Creators explaining the mistake ? I ’m sure they would understand . ”
11290	11324	11281	11281	I	199	“ Are you kidding me ? ! What am I supposed to say ? ‘ Sorry I got a tiny bit drunk and submitted an application tearing apart your most expensive ride ’ ? ”
11334	11345	11325	11325	She	420	“ Maybe it ’s not as bad as you think . ”
11346	11369	11325	11325	She	420	“ I called Lance ’s ride a big metal pile of shit that would make Brady Kane roll over in his grave . ”
11373	11403	11370	11370	She	420	“ Oh , okay . Well . Yeah . You have always had a talent with words . At least you ’re putting that English degree to good use . ”
11407	11432	11404	11404	I	199	“ I ca n’t believe I hit the wrong button . I should have never been drinking and working . What was I thinking ? ”
11456	11480	11446	11446	Her	420	“ Well , this was the first big step in letting go of the past . Maybe it needed to happen like this . ”
11481	11495	11440	11440	she	420	“ Yesterday you said fate was a fool ’s way of avoiding plans . ”
11503	11541	11496	11496	Her	420	“ Only because you love to tout your kismet horn for everyone to hear . So what , you only believe in fate when things go your way ? That sounds like some bullshit logic to me . ”
11547	11564	11542	11542	I	199	“ Yeah , but what if I get fired ? I ’ve already made some mistakes . ”
11607	11619	11602	11602	Claire	420	“ It ’s too late now . You ’re in deep . ”
11633	11641	11630	11630	I	199	“ Let ’s hope for the best ? ”
11983	11997	11974	11974	Martha	57	“ Do I have you to thank for his good mood this morning ? ”
12004	12030	11998	11998	I	199	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re referring to Mr. Kane . He would n’t know a good mood if he was overdosing on Valium . ”
12047	12052	12043	12043	Her	57	“ You ’re trouble . ”
12053	12057	12058	12058	Rowan	256	“ And late , ”
12241	12249	12232	12232	I	199	“ I was on time . Right ? ”
12278	12282	12283	12283	Rowan	256	“ Follow me . ”
12565	12568	12569	12569	He	446	“ Sit . ”
12618	12627	12628	12628	His	446	“ Do you need to use the restroom ? ”
12633	12636	12610	12610	he	446	“ What ? ”
12637	12640	12641	12641	He	446	“ Bathroom ? ”
12655	12661	12641	12641	He	446	“ You keep moving around . ”
12662	12666	12667	12667	My	199	“ Oh no ! ”
12671	12678	12667	12667	My	199	“ Just trying to get comfortable . ”
12679	12690	12641	12641	He	446	“ Do n’t set yourself up for failure like that . ”
12765	12786	12757	12757	He	446	“ Here ’s your new contract . It ’s quite similar to your previous one with The Magic Wand Salon . ”
12792	12801	12757	12757	He	446	“ I ’m sorry . A contract ? ! ”
12836	12848	12827	12827	He	446	“ You ’ll be joining the Creators ’ team effective immediately . ”
12865	12877	12855	12855	I	199	“ I ’m what ? ! Joining the Creators ’ team ? ”
12883	12901	12878	12878	He	446	“ This annoying habit of repeating everything back to me is a waste of time and oxygen . ”
12902	12906	12907	12907	I	199	“ Excuse me ? ”
12911	12932	12907	12907	I	199	“ First off , I have every right to be confused . I thought you were about to fire me ! ”
12961	12969	12949	12953	the dumbest person I ’ve	456	“ You ’re getting a job promotion . ”
13014	13017	13059	13059	He	446	“ How ? ”
13027	13040	13021	13021	his	446	“ Do you always feel the need to ask so many questions ? ”
13041	13058	13059	13059	He	446	“ Do you always feel the need to be evasive and curt in everything you do ? ”
13094	13115	13086	13086	He	446	“ Your Nebula Land submission was rather bold . Not many people dare to critique a billion - dollar investment . ”
13116	13125	13126	13126	I	199	“ I submitted it while I was drunk ! ”
13188	13201	13176	13176	his	446	“ Will this be a habit while you ’re on the clock ? ”
13218	13236	13209	13209	I	199	“ Oh no ! I rarely drink . It was a stupid idea to help me unwind — ”
13242	13253	13237	13237	He	446	“ Save me the monologue . I do n’t care . ”
13304	13324	13295	13295	I	199	“ But I ’m guessing you liked my idea or else you would n’t be offering me a job . ”
13325	13349	13295	13295	I	199	“ My general feelings on the matter are irrelevant . I make decisions based on facts and years of fine - tuned expertise . ”
13405	13416	13395	13395	I	199	“ You want me to work as a Creator permanently ? ”
13417	13447	13449	13450	my God	467	“ Nothing here is permanent . Your job is contingent on your performance , so as long as it meets my standards , then you can consider yourself employed . ”
13630	13642	13625	13625	I	199	“ I ’m sorry . I ca n’t accept your offer . ”
13647	13658	13643	13643	His	482	“ I did n’t ask a yes or no question . ”
13674	13696	13663	13663	He	482	“ You can take your time and review the paperwork but you ’re not leaving this office without signing the contract . ”
13717	13743	13705	13705	they	483	“ This is the twenty - first century . You might be my boss but I wo n’t let you tell me what to do . ”
13744	13752	13779	13779	Rowan	256	“ That in itself is a contradiction . ”
13771	13778	13753	13753	I	199	“ Are you always this cold ? ”
13890	13897	13881	13881	He	482	“ Sign on the dotted line . ”
14015	14021	14003	14003	I	199	“ Is this a typo ? ”
14022	14033	14003	14003	I	199	“ Do I look like a man who makes typos ? ”
14034	14046	14003	14003	I	199	“ But there ’s a ten - thousand - dollar raise . ”
14047	14060	14003	14003	I	199	“ At least your eyesight is n’t as impaired as your judgment . ”
14480	14483	14484	14484	I	199	“ Problem ? ”
14497	14500	14491	14491	She	420	“ No . ”
14501	14511	14491	14491	She	420	“ You ’ve reviewed the same page twice already . ”
14535	14549	14512	14512	She	420	“ I ’m flattered you ’ve been paying such close attention to me . ”
14578	14605	14570	14570	She	420	“ Contracts like these require my full and undivided attention . I ’m not signing anything before I have a chance to read the fine print . ”
14606	14617	14618	14618	She	420	“ You ’re not special enough for any fine print . ”
14691	14700	14734	14734	She	420	“ You ’re nothing like your grandfather described . ”
14710	14716	14734	14734	She	420	“ What did you say ? ”
14743	14753	14734	14734	She	420	“ Forget I said anything . It slipped out . ”
14778	14795	14763	14763	I	199	“ Whatever my grandfather said to a stranger in passing is nothing short of casual conversation . ”
14832	14845	14846	14846	I	199	“ How did you catch yourself in a conversation with my grandfather ? ”
14859	14869	14850	14850	She	420	“ Fate . And it was conversations . Plural . ”
14885	14893	14872	14872	I	199	“ And what happened during these conversations ? ”
14894	14902	14903	14903	Brady	63	“ That ’s between Brady and me . ”
14927	14938	14918	14918	She	420	“ He had quite a bit to say about you . ”
14946	14956	14918	14918	She	420	“ Part of me does n’t want to know . ”
14961	14972	14957	14957	Her	420	“ But part of you ca n’t help being curious . ”
15033	15099	15100	15100	She	420	“ Do n’t worry . He did n’t say too much about you except that you were the dreamer of the three grandkids . And he was very excited for you to take over as the Director one day . Said it was your calling , so I ’m sure he would be happy to see you in his office , destroying his favorite chair . ”
15124	15129	15100	15100	She	420	“ That ’s all ? ”
15130	15160	15183	15183	Zahra	420	“ For the most part . Sorry to disappoint . We were pretty busy working on other things , but I remember how highly he spoke of his grandsons . ”
15259	15265	15266	15266	She	420	“ When do I start ? ”
15297	15307	15282	15282	I	199	“ Monday . Be here at 9 a.m. sharp . ”
15308	15344	15282	15282	I	199	“ Thank you for the opportunity . Really . I might have been shocked earlier when I said no , but I do really appreciate it . I do n’t plan on letting you down . ”
15457	15462	15451	15451	I	199	“ See yourself out . ”
15621	15627	15628	15628	Declan	572	“ How ’s it going ? ”
15634	15661	15665	15665	Zahra	420	“ My schedule has been slammed with meetings from nine to nine but I finally think I have an idea of what I need to do . ”
15667	15678	15679	15679	Declan	572	“ At least I have one brother taking this seriously . ”
15690	15699	15679	15679	Declan	572	“ I ’m waiting for a particular moment . ”
15700	15706	15707	15707	I	199	“ Sounds like an excuse . ”
15722	15740	15719	15719	Declan	572	“ Rowan , let ’s concentrate on your plan first . I ’ll get to Cal after . ”
15741	15774	15775	15775	Declan	572	“ I do n’t need you trying to micromanage me . Have a little trust in my process and let me go about this my way . I ’ve already proven myself . ”
15783	15801	15775	15775	Declan	572	“ There ’s a lot more banking on this one project . If any of us fails — ”
15807	15858	15802	15802	My	199	“ Then we all fail . I got it the first five times you mentioned it . Give me space to figure this all out . You do n’t see me chasing after you , checking in on whether or not you found a wife that meets your unreasonable standards . ”
15859	15899	15900	15900	Cal	46	“ There are no standards in this process because it ’s a contractual obligation . All I care about is finding someone who ’s practical , fertile , and has a face considered proportionate enough to be deemed attractive . ”
15903	15923	15900	15900	Cal	46	“ With that kind of charm , I bet you ’ll be walking down the aisle in no time . ”
15933	15973	15924	15924	Declan	572	“ Will I be your best man ? Before you decide , think about it . Rowan would n’t know the first thing about planning a bachelor party . He considers puffing cigars at your house a good time . ”
15974	15984	16048	16048	Cal	46	“ That ’s because it is a good time . ”
15985	16002	16003	16003	Cal	46	“ Think about it . I ’m talking Vegas . Buffets . Strip clubs . Casinos . ”
16011	16028	16003	16003	Cal	46	“ If you ’re trying to sell me on this , you lost me at Vegas . ”
16032	16047	16029	16029	I	199	“ Declan ’s happy place happens to be the four walls of his home . ”
16054	16066	16048	16048	Cal	46	“ Okay . I ’ll compromise and bring Vegas to you . ”
16067	16081	16082	16082	Cal	46	“ Neither of you will be my best man because I ’m eloping . ”
16085	16115	16082	16082	Cal	46	“ You and Rowan are so boring it ’s no wonder you both get along so well . Only you would skip out on a massive party for eloping . ”
16127	16132	16116	16116	Declan	572	“ You sound jealous . ”
16133	16156	16157	16157	Declan	572	“ Mr. Kane . Mr. Johnson is waiting on line one . A fair warning — he ’s in a foul mood . ”
16167	16178	16179	16179	Cal	46	“ Old man Johnson still giving Iris a hard time ? ”
16183	16190	16191	16191	He	46	“ Did he threaten you again ? ”
16223	16256	16220	16220	Cal	46	“ One day , you ’re going to regret making Iris work on weekends . The best years of her life are ticking by taking care of your old , grumpy ass . ”
16262	16269	16270	16270	He	46	“ Next week . Same time . ”
16598	16623	16624	16624	Claire	420	“ Let me get this straight . You ’re going to be a Creator ? How did you keep this from me all day ? ”
16701	16708	16694	16694	She	2278	“ Yay ! You did it ! ”
16763	16769	16748	16748	she	2278	“ We need to celebrate ! ”
16795	16823	16787	16787	Dad	212	“ I ’m so proud of you ! I knew once the right person realized how talented you are , they would n’t be able to resist . ”
16891	16901	16873	16873	Mom	420	“ Do you have champagne bottles sitting around now ? ”
16902	16923	16924	16924	Dad	212	“ Your mom was planning on opening it for our anniversary next week but today ’s news calls for it . ”
16943	16955	16930	16930	Mom	420	“ Forget about our anniversary . We have plenty of those . ”
17002	17019	16995	16995	Mom	420	“ Our daughter is going to be a Creator ! Did you hear that , Hayk ? ”
17020	17031	17032	17032	Dad	212	“ Hard to miss since I was sitting right here . ”
17069	17096	17097	17097	She	420	“ I ca n’t believe Mr. Kane offered you a job after you told him how disappointing his ride was . Now that ’s our daughter . ”
17107	17118	17104	17104	I	199	“ Well , I did n’t tell him that exactly … ”
17119	17141	17142	17142	Claire	420	“ She ’s lying . She told him that it represented everything Brady Kane would hate if he were still alive . ”
17162	17167	17156	17156	Ani	2278	“ You did n’t . ”
17168	17197	17104	17104	I	199	“ I might have gone a little overboard but it ’s true . The design Lance submitted was only a fraction of the idea I created with Brady . ”
17213	17245	17203	17203	He	212	“ Well , the joke is on Lance . Now you have a new job and you have the chance to fix it until it ’s exactly what you dreamed of . ”
17246	17257	17203	17203	He	212	“ I ’m not sure that ’s what Rowan wants . ”
17292	17310	17311	17311	Dad	212	“ If he hired you , then he has a good idea of what he ’s doing , ”
17626	17629	17616	17616	She	57	“ Go ! ”
17691	17706	17707	17707	I	199	“ I ’m starting to think you ’re not much of a morning person . ”
17731	17739	17721	17721	He	256	“ Wonderful weather , am I right ? ”
17745	17772	17740	17740	Someone	2058	“ Why yes , Zahra , I was wondering what ’s the point of showering in the morning if the humidity does the job for me ? ”
17817	17826	17808	17808	I	199	“ How do you like Dreamland so far ? ”
17827	17832	17833	17833	he	2058	“ I do n’t , ”
17848	17851	17839	17839	I	199	“ Oh . ”
17865	17873	17839	17839	I	199	“ Do you have a favorite ride ? ”
17874	17877	17839	17839	I	199	“ No . ”
17894	17905	17887	17887	We	536	“ Me neither ! There are too many good ones . ”
17912	17923	17887	17887	We	536	“ What ’s your favorite part about being the Director ? ”
17924	17934	17887	17887	We	536	“ The silence at the end of the workday . ”
18331	18351	18352	18352	he	467	“ Are you ready to meet everyone or are you still interested in wasting company time with your tour ? ”
18752	18756	18757	18757	He	256	“ Go on . ”
18763	18771	18757	18757	He	256	“ Get back to work , everyone . ”
18917	18947	18910	18910	Jenny	75	“ We ’re thrilled to have you as a part of our team , Zahra . I ’m glad Sam backed down pretty fast during our fight for you . ”
18948	18954	18910	18910	Jenny	75	“ A fight over me ? ”
18966	18997	18963	18963	She	75	“ Do n’t worry . I took it easy on him . I laid on the fake tears and he broke down quicker than a McDonald ’s ice cream machine . ”
19013	19041	19005	19005	Jenny	75	“ I ’m the one who thought Mr. Kane needed to read your submission himself . Sam was a bit hesitant given the nature of the content . ”
19045	19050	19042	19042	I	199	“ I ’m sorry . ”
19059	19098	19051	19051	She	75	“ Please . No apologies needed . We ’re in such a time crunch and there ’s no reason to apologize for stating how you feel . You ’re the kind of Creator we need on our team . ”
19099	19108	19005	19005	Jenny	75	“ Wow . I mean — thank you . ”
19118	19172	19051	19051	She	75	“ Let me give you a quick rundown of how things work around here . On Fridays , each Creator is responsible for presenting a new proposal . There ’s a multi - step six - month process set in place to give Mr. Kane as many options as possible to choose from . ”
19173	19178	19051	19051	She	75	“ Choose for what ? ”
19182	19214	19179	19179	Jenny	75	“ He ’s planning a fiftieth - anniversary update . A lot is riding on a project of this scale , so he expects us all to be at our best . ”
19215	19227	19051	19051	She	75	“ You got it ! I wo n’t let you down . ”
19228	19252	19179	19179	Jenny	75	“ I ’ll let you get settled in . I hope you like Italian because the Betas planned a welcome lunch for you . ”
19253	19260	19051	19051	She	75	“ Only monsters hate Italian food . ”
19264	19278	19279	19279	She	75	“ I knew you ’d fit right in . See you at noon . ”
19409	19412	19413	19413	I	199	“ Yes ? ”
19428	19441	19442	19442	His	256	“ Do you mind putting away your weapon before I start speaking ? ”
19449	19462	19463	19463	I	199	“ Is the big bad Mr. Kane afraid of a little stapler ? ”
19489	19504	19545	19545	he	256	“ I would n’t trust you with bubble wrap , let alone a stapler . ”
19505	19520	19545	19545	he	256	“ You ’re right . That choking hazard warning should be taken more seriously . ”
19564	19573	19545	19545	he	256	“ Any other weapons I should know about ? ”
19684	19694	19679	19679	I	199	“ Can I help you with something in particular ? ”
19728	19738	19726	19726	Zahra	420	“ What do you think of my new digs ? ”
19739	19746	19747	19747	His	256	“ Leaves something to be desired . ”
19828	19832	19833	19833	He	256	“ Move over . ”
19847	19850	19851	19851	I	199	“ Why ? ”
19854	19866	19833	19833	He	256	“ For some unknown reason , I feel like helping you . ”
19867	19870	19871	19871	I	199	“ Because ? ”
19883	19894	19871	19871	I	199	“ Because you should n’t be trusted around electrical outlets . ”
20298	20309	20274	20275	Jane Austen	96	“ What in God ’s name are you whispering about ? ”
20318	20326	20313	20313	I	199	“ Is the computer all fixed now ? ”
20336	20339	20313	20313	I	199	“ Yes . ”
20340	20351	20352	20352	I	199	“ Great . Thanks ! You can see yourself out . ”
20766	20771	20753	20753	I	199	“ Here goes nothing . ”
20860	20868	20849	20849	Jenny	75	“ So who wants to go first ? ”
21051	21056	21039	21039	he	256	“ Proceed as usual . ”
21213	21220	21221	21221	Jenny	75	“ Zahra . You ’re up , ”
21261	21275	21276	21276	Rowan	256	“ Move along with it . I have another meeting in twenty minutes . ”
21406	21415	21396	21396	I	199	“ Looks like I ’m out of time . ”
21434	21442	21443	21443	Rowan	256	“ Go back to the last slide . ”
21455	21477	21443	21443	Rowan	256	“ Oh , it ’s nothing important . Just a mock - up . And you have a meeting now anyway . ”
21482	21488	21478	21478	His	256	“ I was n’t asking . ”
21510	21516	21506	21506	His	256	“ Now , Ms. Gulian . ”
21532	21538	21517	21517	I	199	“ It ’s really nothing . ”
21548	21558	21517	21517	I	199	“ I ’ll be the one to decide that . ”
21652	21660	21644	21644	Rowan	256	“ Your drawings could use some work . ”
21661	21672	21673	21673	My	199	“ I ’ll be sure to get right on that . ”
21703	21722	21699	21699	Rowan	256	“ Everyone better come back with better ideas next Friday . I was underwhelmed to say the least . ”
21760	21783	21752	21752	He	256	“ Use Ms. Gulian ’s presentation as a guide for what I expect from here on out . Minus the last slide . ”
21788	21797	21752	21752	He	256	“ Everyone is dismissed except for Ms. Gulian . ”
21949	21963	21995	21995	He	256	“ If you talk to me like that in front of anyone again — ”
21964	21994	21995	21995	He	256	“ Let me guess . You ’ll fire me . It ’s a bit predictable for my taste but I respect it since you ’re the man in charge . ”
22074	22084	22070	22070	His	256	“ There are worse things I ’m capable of . ”
22092	22095	22070	22070	His	256	“ Like ? ”
22096	22107	22070	22070	His	256	“ I do n’t think you want to find out . ”
22121	22141	22108	22108	I	199	“ You better have a massive dick to back up that attitude or else people will be mighty disappointed . ”
22142	22154	22070	22070	His	256	“ Care to bring out a ruler and test your theory ? ”
22155	22168	22169	22169	I	199	“ I left my magnifying glass at home , so maybe tomorrow . ”
22216	22223	22196	22196	I	199	“ Are you always this impossible ? ”
22224	22239	22242	22242	he	256	“ I do n’t know . Are you always this much of an asshole ? ”
22660	22663	22679	22679	His	256	“ Shit . ”
23520	23523	23524	23524	he	46	“ Fucker , ”
23584	23594	23599	23599	His	212	“ Any updates on Dreamland ’s progress , Rowan ? ”
23649	23668	23638	23638	I	199	“ The Creator teams have already been assembled and they ’re making quick progress on developing some ideas . ”
23672	23725	23669	23669	Father	212	“ Good . I think it would be beneficial to have you present during our next meeting on the preliminary findings . Your ten - billion - dollar budget is drastic , and I ’m sure the rest of the board is interested in learning more about the allocation of the funds . ”
23738	23760	23728	23728	I	199	“ Of course I can present on my budget . Is there anything in particular that you would like to see ? ”
23766	23806	23761	23761	He	212	“ I ’m sure everyone is equally interested in learning more about the creative design process behind an operation this large . There has n’t been a renovation on this scale since the twenty - five - year mark . ”
23900	23918	23884	23884	he	212	“ I ’d be more than happy to share everything I ’ve been working on thus far . ”
24007	24017	24018	24018	Claire	420	“ Any word from Rowan since he kissed you ? ”
24069	24084	24061	24061	I	199	“ No . And you promised not to bother me any more about it . ”
24106	24124	24155	24155	Claire	420	“ I know . I know . But there ’s a question that ’s been bothering me . ”
24125	24128	24183	24183	She	420	“ What ? ”
24132	24139	24129	24129	She	420	“ Was it better than Lance ? ”
24143	24154	24140	24140	I	199	“ It ’s like comparing a hurricane to a drizzle . ”
24158	24172	24155	24155	Claire	420	“ Damn . What else do you think his mouth is good at ? ”
24179	24182	24173	24173	Heat	101	“ Nothing . ”
24186	24205	24183	24183	She	420	“ Ohh , you ’re turning red ! Admit it . You ’ve totally been thinking about him . ”
24206	24209	24183	24183	She	420	“ No . ”
24220	24238	24183	24183	She	420	“ We need to work on your ability to lie . The blush is a dead giveaway . ”
24256	24279	24251	24251	I	199	“ I actually have n’t thought about him at all . In fact , I ’m grateful he left for the week . ”
24360	24372	24402	24402	Claire	420	“ What ’s your plan on managing your attraction to him ? ”
24376	24382	24373	24373	I	199	“ There is no plan . ”
24383	24391	24392	24392	She	648	“ Just like there was no kiss ? ”
24398	24401	24395	24395	I	199	“ Exactly . ”
24407	24421	24402	24402	Claire	420	“ If you had to guess , how big was his dick again ? ”
24444	24469	24422	24422	I	199	“ Hate to break it to you , but if you still remember his dick size , you ’re totally still thinking about him . ”
24476	24486	24422	24422	I	199	“ You ’ve got to be freaking kidding me . ”
24596	24603	24592	24592	I	199	“ What are you doing here ? ”
24617	24625	24590	24590	Yup	102	“ I ’m checking in on everyone . ”
24686	24699	24735	24735	He	256	“ And you decided my office is a good place to start ? ”
24700	24722	24735	24735	He	256	“ I ’m starting with the person who gives me the most amount of trouble and working my way from here . ”
24723	24734	24735	24735	He	256	“ I ’m flattered to have earned such a reputation . ”
24843	24855	24856	24856	He	256	“ When you blush , it makes your freckles stand out . ”
24935	24943	24916	24916	He	256	“ I ’ve got work to do . ”
24999	25008	24988	24988	he	256	“ And what ’s this supposed to be ? ”
25009	25019	24988	24988	he	256	“ A new float idea I came up with . ”
25027	25046	25020	25020	He	256	“ I could guess that based on the shape . But what are they supposed to be celebrating ? ”
25047	25057	24988	24988	he	256	“ Are you making fun of my drawings again ? ”
25058	25066	25020	25020	He	256	“ No . Now answer my question . ”
25067	25077	24988	24988	he	256	“ Would it kill you to say please sometimes ? ”
25089	25097	25083	25083	I	199	“ It ’s a classic Hindu wedding . ”
25107	25120	25098	25098	He	256	“ Interesting . And when are you presenting this to the team ? ”
25121	25124	25098	25098	He	256	“ Friday . ”
25125	25128	25129	25129	He	256	“ Hmm . ”
25200	25230	25192	25192	Rowan	256	“ What ? If it ’s a bad idea , spit it out already . I ’d rather not look like an embarrassment in front of my coworkers again . ”
25245	25251	25231	25231	He	256	“ The idea is fine . ”
25378	25387	25363	25363	His	256	“ I ’m sorry . That was inappropriate . ”
25393	25408	25388	25388	I	199	“ I think touching my hand can be considered tame compared to other things . ”
25414	25421	25409	25409	His	256	“ What ’s your angle here ? ”
25422	25431	25409	25409	His	256	“ Angle ? What are you talking about ? ”
25432	25443	25409	25409	His	256	“ Are you trying to get money out of me ? ”
25444	25450	25451	25451	God	467	“ What ? ! Money ? ”
25488	25501	25502	25502	he	256	“ It would n’t be the first time something like that happened , ”
25519	25530	25510	25510	he	256	“ Is kissing your employees a repeat occurrence for you ? ”
25540	25545	25546	25546	He	256	“ What ? No . ”
25577	25611	25612	25612	he	256	“ But I ’d rather you name your price to me in private than go to HR with a complaint , but I ca n’t stop you . I wo n’t stop you , ”
25627	25635	25619	25619	I	199	“ I ’m not going to HR . ”
25664	25667	25668	25668	He	256	“ Okay . ”
25676	25685	25668	25668	He	256	“ The idea is good . Great even . ”
25712	25737	25705	25705	He	256	“ Take a breath . I ’m not in the mood to call an ambulance when you pass out and crack your head open . ”
25738	25755	25705	25705	He	256	“ How dare I consider for a second that you would catch me before that happens . ”
25756	25770	25705	25705	He	256	“ That requires caring and I ’m fresh out of fucks to give . ”
25792	25799	25783	25783	him	256	“ I better get to work . ”
25818	25825	25800	25800	He	256	“ I ’ll be taking this . ”
25826	25831	25832	25832	I	199	“ What ? Why ? ”
25849	25860	25800	25800	He	256	“ Because this drawing is n’t going to fix itself . ”
25861	25870	25832	25832	I	199	“ And you ’re going to fix it ? ”
25910	25924	25901	25901	He	256	“ No . I do n’t draw but I know someone who does . ”
25925	25933	25934	25934	He	256	“ Really ? You have friends ? ! ”
25941	25954	25955	25955	he	256	“ I do n’t consider those who work for me as friends , ”
25965	25974	25934	25934	He	256	“ Do you think they ’ll help me ? ”
25986	25999	25975	25975	His	256	“ If only to spare me from witnessing your secondhand embarrassment again . ”
26011	26018	26000	26000	My	199	“ I ’m all for that . ”
26021	26034	26000	26000	My	199	“ Do you trust them to not share the idea with anyone ? ”
26039	26042	26000	26000	My	199	“ Why ? ”
26047	26067	26043	26043	My	199	“ I want to make sure it remains a secret until I present on it . That ’s all . ”
26068	26073	26074	26074	He	256	“ I trust them . ”
26103	26107	26108	26108	My	199	“ Thank you ! ”
26256	26264	26265	26265	I	199	“ What are you doing , man ? ”
26280	26290	26265	26265	I	199	“ Being a stupid fuck for some unknown reason . ”
26575	26578	26579	26579	I	199	“ Shit . ”
27098	27111	27085	27085	She	420	“ Hello ! Can you announce your presence like a normal person ? ”
27176	27183	27169	27169	She	420	“ What ’s wrong with you ? ”
27191	27194	27184	27184	I	199	“ Nothing . ”
27195	27198	27199	27199	She	420	“ Right . ”
27238	27243	27228	27228	Her	420	“ This is amazing . ”
27407	27413	27414	27414	I	199	“ I better get going . ”
27423	27426	27427	27427	She	420	“ Wait ! ”
27434	27437	27439	27439	she	420	“ What ? ”
27456	27463	27451	27451	She	420	“ It ’s missing a signature . ”
27464	27468	27449	27449	she	420	“ What is ? ”
27469	27473	27451	27451	She	420	“ The drawing . ”
27491	27494	27474	27474	I	199	“ And ? ”
27497	27516	27517	27517	Her	420	“ And whoever designed it deserves credit for their work . It ’s the right thing to do . ”
27603	27634	27598	27598	I	199	“ The artist is a contact I have from the Animation Department . It ’s a half - assed rush job , so do n’t worry about giving them credit . ”
27635	27651	27652	27652	I	199	“ Will you share their number with me so I could tell them thank you ? ”
27655	27662	27652	27652	I	199	“ They want to remain anonymous . ”
27663	27695	27696	27696	She	679	“ Okay , how about you give them my number then . If they do n’t want to text me , then they do n’t have to . No hard feelings . ”
27763	27776	27754	27754	My	199	“ And what do you stand to get out of this conversation ? ”
27785	27796	27777	27777	She	679	“ Are you always this cynical about people ’s intentions ? ”
27797	27800	27777	27777	She	679	“ Yes . ”
27805	27815	27801	27801	Her	679	“ Expressing gratitude is n’t exactly an exchange program . ”
27816	27826	27777	27777	She	679	“ I wo n’t take your word for it . ”
27995	27998	27984	27984	She	679	“ Here . ”
31051	31059	31041	31041	I	199	“ Am I working you too hard ? ”
31159	31173	31153	31153	I	199	“ No . I did n’t get a lot of sleep last night . ”
31174	31180	31184	31184	his	256	“ Something keeping you up ? ”
31188	31209	31184	31184	his	256	“ Do n’t start asking me personal questions . I might do something crazy like assume you care about me . ”
31210	31219	31153	31153	I	199	“ Save the fairy tales for your proposals . ”
31223	31232	31220	31220	I	199	“ Do you talk about anything besides work ? ”
31233	31243	31244	31244	He	256	“ Why would I ? Work is my life . ”
31255	31266	31184	31184	his	256	“ That ’s sad , Rowan . Even for you . ”
31267	31274	31220	31220	I	199	“ I do n’t see how . ”
31275	31285	31184	31184	his	256	“ What do you like to do for fun ? ”
31286	31294	31220	31220	I	199	“ People still do things for fun ? ”
31319	31335	31311	31311	I	199	“ You need to find a hobby that does n’t include watching the stock market . ”
31336	31348	31184	31184	his	256	“ One does not simply ‘ watch the stock market . ’ ”
31354	31395	31349	31349	I	199	“ I ca n’t believe you said that with a serious face . With the way you act , you ’ll end up in a shallow grave before you have your first gray hair because you ’re addicted to work . ”
31403	31412	31396	31396	His	256	“ I did n’t ask for your opinion . ”
31413	31430	31396	31396	His	256	“ No . But it ’s not like you can fire me for stating an observation . ”
31431	31442	31396	31396	His	256	“ At least not while you ’re my golden ticket . ”
31517	31528	31507	31507	I	199	“ Is there a reason you came by my office ? ”
31529	31544	31569	31569	he	737	“ Is that what we ’re calling cubicles the size of my shower nowadays ? ”
31553	31566	31569	31569	he	737	“ Hiding your hand defeats the intended purpose of such a gesture . ”
31594	31619	31569	31569	he	737	“ My dad taught me that if I do n’t have anything nice to say , then I should n’t say anything at all . ”
31620	31630	31569	31569	he	737	“ Should n’t that rule extend to offensive gestures ? ”
31639	31652	31631	31631	I	199	“ Because you ’re the kind of person who gets offended now ? ”
31664	31678	31653	31653	His	737	“ Your file never mentioned an issue with talking back to authority figures . ”
31683	31692	31679	31679	I	199	“ You ’ve been reading up on me . ”
31693	31701	31679	31679	I	199	“ I tend to research my investments . ”
31778	31781	31769	31769	Rowan	256	“ What ? ”
31787	31790	31791	31791	He	780	“ Nothing . ”
32337	32340	32323	32323	Claire	420	“ Zahra ! ”
32354	32358	32347	32347	she	420	“ What ? ! ”
32359	32365	32347	32347	she	420	“ I got a job ! ”
32366	32375	32347	32347	she	420	“ Really ? ! At The Royal Chateau ? ”
32393	32398	32387	32387	Her	420	“ Well , no . ”
32399	32405	32347	32347	she	420	“ I ’m so confused . ”
32406	32411	32412	32412	Claire	420	“ Let me explain . ”
32432	32444	32420	32420	she	420	“ So I was a complete wreck during my entire interview . ”
32449	32453	32445	32445	My	199	“ Oh no . ”
32459	32500	32501	32501	She	420	“ Everything that could possibly go wrong did . I overcooked the chicken and undercooked the fish . Then my souffle deflated before I had a chance to even plate it and I burned my hand on a hot pan . ”
32510	32543	32544	32544	Claire	420	“ It was so embarrassing . The sous chef dismissed me in the middle of the interview after yelling at me for wasting her time . She made me feel this tall . ”
32566	32590	32611	32611	She	420	“ I ’m so sorry , Claire . I feel responsible for pushing you into this before you were ready . I thought — ”
32591	32606	32611	32611	She	420	“ No ! Thanks to you , I ended up landing something even better . ”
32607	32610	32611	32611	She	420	“ How ? ”
32624	32634	32611	32611	She	420	“ I ran into the chef outside the restaurant . ”
32635	32645	32611	32611	She	420	“ How did you know they were the chef ? ”
32646	32675	32611	32611	She	420	“ It ’s a funny story . You see , I did n’t know who he was at the time . He thought I was an injured animal . ”
32676	32680	32681	32681	I	199	“ No way . ”
32698	32758	32695	32695	She	420	“ Yes . I do n’t think he was prepared for the Pandora ’s box he unleashed when he asked if I was okay . All the emotions exploded out of me . I have to give him credit . He stood there quietly while I went off about how I tanked the most important interview of my career . ”
32759	32762	32611	32611	She	420	“ And ? ”
32763	32788	32695	32695	She	420	“ And then he asked me a couple of questions about my favorite things to cook before telling me to make his favorite meal ! ”
32794	32798	32789	32789	My	199	“ Get out . ”
32799	32829	32611	32611	She	420	“ It was like a movie ! So I cooked him the best grilled cheese and tomato soup that man has ever tasted . His words , not mine . ”
32830	32849	32789	32789	My	199	“ A chef ’s favorite meal is grilled cheese ? Does n’t that seem a bit … basic ? ”
32850	32860	32861	32861	Claire	420	“ There is no room for basic bitches here . ”
32951	32956	32957	32957	I	199	“ Then what happened ? ”
32973	32990	32957	32957	I	199	“ He offered me a second interview after nearly orgasming on the spot from my food . ”
32994	32998	32991	32991	I	199	“ Shut up . ”
32999	33019	33020	33020	She	420	“ Okay , that was dramatic , even for me . But his eyes did roll the tiniest bit . ”
33023	33031	32991	32991	I	199	“ So what is your new job then ?
33032	33092	32991	32991	I	199	“ The head chef is being transferred to a new restaurant project with Mr. Kane so he wo n’t be working at The Royal Chateau anymore . And I ’m going to be part of the chef ’s team ! It does n’t have a name or anything yet , but I ’m guaranteed a spot in the kitchen . ”
33093	33100	32991	32991	I	199	“ Claire ! This is huge ! ”
33112	33115	33101	33101	Her	420	“ Right ? !
33116	33121	33122	33122	I	199	“ We need wine ! ”
33145	33194	33195	33195	She	420	“ Without you pushing me to try , I would ’ve never bombed the interview . And without crying by a dumpster , then I would n’t have run into the best opportunity yet ! So I now believe in fate . You were right all these years . ”
33208	33220	33291	33291	Claire	420	“ So us meeting did n’t convince you that fate exists ? ”
33226	33250	33221	33221	Claire	420	“ No . I thought you were just an annoying person who crashed into me because you wanted to steal the parking spot . ”
33251	33262	33221	33221	Claire	420	“ One man ’s accident is another man ’s fate . ”
33263	33271	33221	33221	Claire	420	“ Tell that to my insurance company . ”
34646	34654	34655	34655	Declan	572	“ Something ’s off about our father . ”
34663	34681	34682	34682	I	199	“ I ’ve noticed the same thing . Today was different from what I came prepared for . ”
34706	34756	34757	34757	Declan	572	“ He ’s too quiet about the will which only tells me he ’s hiding something from us . I ’m not sure what to make of it but I ’m keeping an eye on him . It ’s only a matter of time before he reveals his cards . ”
34784	34807	34763	34763	Iris	84	“ Must you eat so much , Mr. Kane ? Your doctor said to watch your cholesterol since you ’re getting older . ”
34827	34839	34816	34816	he	572	“ What did I tell you about reading my personal file ? ”
34850	34875	34840	34840	Iris	84	“ Well , how else am I supposed to put together an informational packet for all of your potential suitors without any personal information ? ”
34876	34883	34884	34884	he	572	“ Easy . You do n’t , ”
34888	34896	34897	34897	I	199	“ How is the wife search going ? ”
34940	34973	34934	34934	Iris	84	“ I can tell you that I ’ve been on more dates with women in the last month than your brother has been on for the entirety of me working for him . ”
35021	35035	35009	35009	Declan	572	“ Iris is pre - vetting the women before I meet with them . ”
35036	35044	35005	35005	I	199	“ And people say romance is dead . ”
35045	35063	35064	35064	Declan	572	“ What do you expect me to do ? Fall in love the old - fashioned way ? ”
35204	35222	35195	35195	Iris	84	“ Mr. Kane does n’t have time to waste , so I ’m the next best thing . ”
35223	35234	35235	35235	I	199	“ You do know him best after all these years . ”
35284	35300	35301	35301	Declan	572	“ So cut the shit and tell me what ’s really going on at Dreamland , ”
36554	36557	36558	36558	She	59	“ Rowan ? ”
36622	36627	36612	36612	She	59	“ What ’s that ? ”
36636	36648	36628	36628	I	199	“ Here . I was told to give this to you . ”
36756	36760	36761	36761	I	199	“ All good ? ”
36770	36781	36764	36764	Her	59	“ Yeah . Are you friends with Scott or something ? ”
36787	36790	36782	36782	My	199	“ Why ? ”
36791	36828	36764	36764	Her	59	“ Because you do n’t seem like the kind of man who has the time to drop off papers that have nothing to do with you . Are n’t you supposed to be busy or something ? ”
36829	36833	36834	36834	I	199	“ Or something . ”
36845	36849	36837	36837	She	59	“ So sensitive . ”
36861	36902	36837	36837	She	59	“ You ’re right . I do have better things to do than serve as your personal mail courier . If Scott does n’t have the courage to face you himself , then that ’s his problem , not mine . ”
36912	36926	36928	36928	her	59	“ Oh , sure . No problem . I ’ll text him myself . ”
37889	37915	37916	37916	Rowan	256	“ Tardiness will not be tolerated . If this happens again , you ’ll be required to work additional hours to make up for it . ”
37977	37985	37986	37986	His	256	“ Take a seat or get out . ”
38050	38060	38061	38061	Rowan	256	“ Now that everyone is finally here , proceed . ”
38089	38096	38072	38072	Jenny	75	“ Who wants to go first ? ”
38144	38150	38151	38151	She	75	“ Come on , everyone . ”
38158	38170	38151	38151	She	75	“ Do I need to draw names out of a hat ? ”
38179	38184	38185	38185	I	199	“ I ’ll go . ”
38355	38361	38362	38362	Rowan	256	“ It could be better , ”
38366	38370	38371	38371	I	199	“ How so ? ”
38379	38391	38371	38371	I	199	“ What if we changed the entire layout of the ride . ”
38392	38397	38401	38401	Zahra	59	“ The entire layout ? ”
38403	38469	38371	38371	I	199	“ Instead of having the roller coaster carts created to represent the dragon flying , let ’s have the dragon be a part of the ride . We will keep your mountain idea , but I want the coaster to dive into the dark caves as if riders are escaping the dragon . I want fire , special effects , animatronics , and backward tracks . ”
38560	38573	38554	38554	I	199	“ Backward ? We ’ve never had a ride like that before . ”
38574	38577	38578	38578	He	256	“ Obviously . ”
38597	38616	38617	38617	He	256	“ Your idea is a good starting point , but we need to up the stakes . Next . ”
38933	38941	38942	38942	Rowan	256	“ The presentations were subpar at best . ”
38961	39020	38951	38951	He	256	“ I want you all to stop wasting my time and come prepared with ground - breaking ideas that leave me wowed . If I continue to find your proposals lacking , then I ’ll be forced to find people willing to get the job done right the first time . Consider this your first and last warning . ”
39064	39085	39045	39045	I	199	“ Until further notice , employees will be expected to work twelve - hour days to increase productivity and creativity . ”
39086	39094	39095	39100	someone in the back pipes up	899	“ Will we receive a pay raise ? ”
39113	39125	39102	39102	Rowan	256	“ Am I supposed to reward you all for being average ? ”
39190	39198	39199	39199	Rowan	256	“ Raises are earned , not given . ”
39220	39234	39215	39215	Jenny	75	“ So that was a lot to unwrap . Are there any questions ? ”
39919	39926	39927	39927	Martha	57	“ You ’ve got a package . ”
41098	41105	41088	41088	Her	59	“ Oh . It ’s you . ”
41106	41112	41117	41117	she	59	“ Waiting for someone else ? ”
41147	41161	41142	41142	Her	59	“ Huh ? No . Just checking if someone had any questions about — ”
41173	41188	41162	41162	Her	59	“ Wow ! I did n’t think that so many people would be interested ! ”
41245	41256	41298	41298	she	59	“ There was only one left when I got here . ”
41283	41293	41276	41276	Zahra	59	“ Does that mean you took the last one ? ”
41308	41311	41312	41312	I	199	“ Yes , ”
41336	41347	41348	41348	Her	59	“ Great ! Be there tonight at 8 p.m. sharp . ”
41369	41381	41366	41366	I	199	“ Are n’t you supposed to be working at that time ? ”
41382	41400	41451	41451	Her	59	“ What if I told you this is a part of an idea I ’m working on ? ”
41413	41450	41401	41401	I	199	“ Doubt it . I ca n’t imagine approving of anything that involves cupcakes and charades . I do n’t know who you ’re trying to mentor here but we ’re not interested in hiring toddlers . ”
41455	41467	41468	41468	She	59	“ Forget you ever read about this and lose my number . ”
41726	41733	41721	41721	Zahra	59	“ What are you doing here ? ”
41761	41772	41754	41754	me	199	“ I ’m here for a meeting . Carry on . ”
41786	41805	41773	41773	She	59	“ You do n’t tell me what to do . You ’re not my boss after working hours . ”
41806	41822	41773	41773	She	59	“ If you ’re on company property , then you ’re still considered my employee . ”
41823	41830	41773	41773	She	59	“ Everything here is company property . ”
41831	41836	41773	41773	She	59	“ Perceptive as ever . ”
42004	42017	42001	42001	Zahra	59	“ Now ’s your chance to leave before it ’s too late . ”
42018	42029	42030	42030	I	199	“ I think I ’d like to see this through . ”
42063	42071	42058	42058	Zahra	59	“ Be nice . He ’s cute . ”
42101	42106	42096	42096	Zahra	59	“ I am nice . ”
42112	42119	42120	42120	Zahra	59	“ Why are you really here ? ”
42148	42157	42120	42120	Zahra	59	“ I ’m interested in the mentorship program . ”
42161	42172	42158	42158	She	59	“ What happened to not being interested in hiring toddlers ? ”
42173	42178	42120	42120	Zahra	59	“ I was wrong . ”
42184	42210	42180	42180	her	59	“ You — well . Wow . Okay . I did n’t think you had it in you to admit when you make a mistake . ”
42211	42223	42224	42224	My	199	“ Do n’t hold your breath waiting for the next time . ”
42232	42253	42287	42287	Buddy	129	“ So , are you going to start the meeting or do you plan on staring at me all night ? ”
42271	42286	42260	42260	Zahra	59	“ You know what , Rowan ? I have the perfect buddy for you . ”
42353	42362	42344	42344	Zahra	59	“ Ani , you ’re partnered with Rowan . ”
42369	42372	42366	42366	Zahra	59	“ Yes ! ”
42383	42393	42394	42394	Ani	2278	“ So my sister told me all about you . ”
42428	42434	42435	42435	She	59	“ Who ’s your sister ? ”
42448	42451	42435	42435	She	59	“ Zahra . ”
42456	42466	42452	42452	My	199	“ I did n’t know she had a sister . ”
42467	42470	42471	42471	She	59	“ Surprise ! ”
42474	42487	42488	42488	Ani	2278	“ Well , is it too late to revoke her sister card ? ”
42496	42499	42488	42488	Ani	2278	“ Why ? ”
42500	42512	42488	42488	Ani	2278	“ Because no sister who loves you would partner us together . ”
42513	42525	42488	42488	Ani	2278	“ Oh , please . I doubt you ’re that bad . ”
42526	42540	42488	42488	Ani	2278	“ And you got that in the two seconds you ’ve known me ? ”
42546	42564	42541	42541	Ani	2278	“ Because not many guys would come to a meeting like this . Lance never wanted to . ”
42565	42570	42541	42541	Ani	2278	“ Who ’s Lance ? ”
42571	42576	42541	42541	Ani	2278	“ Zahra ’s ex . ”
42577	42584	42541	42541	Ani	2278	“ He sounds like a dick . ”
42589	42594	42585	42585	She	59	“ No bad words . ”
42612	42618	42602	42602	She	59	“ I never liked him . ”
42619	42622	42602	42602	She	59	“ Because ? ”
42623	42649	42650	42650	She	59	“ Because he looked at me funny . And sometimes I heard him say things on the phone when I was n’t supposed to listen . ”
42672	42675	42602	42602	She	59	“ Like ? ”
42682	42685	42676	42676	She	59	“ Nothing . ”
42686	42693	42676	42676	She	59	“ Why are you protecting him ? ”
42694	42715	42716	42716	Her	59	“ I ’m not . It ’s old news , and I do n’t want to make Zahra sad again . ”
42756	42764	42749	42749	Ani	2278	“ So why did you come tonight ? ”
42765	42770	42749	42749	Ani	2278	“ I was curious . ”
42771	42776	42777	42777	Her	59	“ About my sister ? ”
42781	42800	42801	42801	Ani	2278	“ About the meeting . I was n’t sure if she was planning a coup d’état against me . ”
42804	42816	42801	42801	Ani	2278	“ Do n’t worry . Your secret ’s safe with me . ”
42817	42821	42749	42749	Ani	2278	“ What secret ? ”
42822	42830	42831	42831	She	59	“ You wanted to see my sister . ”
42848	42856	42841	42841	I	199	“ I ’ll take that as payment . ”
42878	42886	42887	42887	She	59	“ Hey ! Payment for what ? ! ”
42898	42918	42887	42887	She	59	“ For the emotional turmoil you ’re bound to put me through by the time we ’re done here . ”
42919	42932	42887	42887	She	59	“ It ’s only day one . You still have months left . ”
42933	42943	42887	42887	She	59	“ Then you better bring a lot of cupcakes . ”
43974	43981	43964	43964	Ani	2278	“ So , Rowan ’s cute . ”
43989	43992	43982	43982	I	199	“ Stop . ”
44092	44103	44104	44104	She	514	“ But look at him teaching JP how to bowl . ”
44160	44173	44155	44155	I	199	“ Not happening , so whatever you ’re planning , stop it . ”
44174	44181	44194	44194	She	514	“ I ’m not planning anything . ”
44182	44193	44155	44155	I	199	“ You bring him up during every conversation we have . ”
44197	44202	44194	44194	She	514	“ I like him . ”
44203	44211	44194	44194	She	514	“ Does n’t mean I have to . ”
44212	44218	44194	44194	She	514	“ But you like everyone ! ”
44222	44227	44219	44219	I	199	“ Not this one . ”
44228	44241	44194	44194	She	514	“ Yeah , right . You blush anytime he looks at you . ”
44242	44249	44219	44219	I	199	“ No , I do n’t ! ”
44255	44259	44250	44250	She	514	“ Do too ! ”
44260	44272	44194	44194	She	514	“ Why are you staring at me like a creep anyway ? ”
44273	44285	44250	44250	She	514	“ Because it ’s funny . Rowan gets all nervous too . ”
44286	44291	44292	44292	I	199	“ Oh , really ? ”
44318	44325	44312	44312	She	197	“ What else do you notice ? ”
44326	44335	44336	44336	She	197	“ I thought you did n’t like him ? ”
44478	44481	44468	44468	I	199	“ What ? ”
44487	44490	44482	44482	His	256	“ Nothing . ”
44491	44497	44498	44498	Ani	2278	“ Your turn , Zahra ! ”
44502	44518	44498	44498	Ani	2278	“ Hurry up . We only have thirty minutes left before our time runs out . ”
44548	44559	44560	44560	Rowan	256	“ Your wrist is twisting right before you throw it . ”
44571	44583	44565	44565	I	199	“ And you ’re a bowling expert all of a sudden ? ”
44587	44592	44584	44584	He	256	“ I played varsity . ”
44620	44623	44624	44624	I	199	“ What ? ”
44627	44634	44635	44635	He	256	“ Forget I offered to help . ”
44761	44768	44769	44769	I	199	“ So , varsity , huh ? ”
44789	44803	44784	44784	His	256	“ I can guarantee that your jokes will be nothing new to me . ”
44818	44832	44804	44804	I	199	“ I ’m sorry . It was a shitty thing to laugh at . ”
44833	44837	44812	44812	his	256	“ It was . ”
44838	44846	44804	44804	I	199	“ I was n’t laughing at you . ”
44873	44902	44866	44866	I	199	“ Okay , I was laughing at the situation , but to be fair , I did n’t even know there was such a thing as varsity bowling . ”
44903	44920	44860	44860	him	256	“ Do n’t beat yourself up too much over it . I ’ve dealt with worse . ”
45016	45028	45014	45014	Abort	133	“ It ’s kind of cool . Women love letterman jackets . ”
45029	45044	45014	45014	Abort	133	“ I valued my reputation far too much to wear that jacket at school . ”
45045	45048	45014	45014	Abort	133	“ Why ? ”
45049	45080	45014	45014	Abort	133	“ Because I only joined the team to spite my father . He never specified which team I should join , so I liked beating him at his own game . ”
45107	45151	45152	45152	He	1013	“ He was pissed I never made it past any of the ‘ real sports ’ team tryouts like my brothers . While Declan was the school quarterback and Cal was the team captain of his hockey team , I was … lacking . ”
45157	45166	45152	45152	He	1013	“ According to my father , that is . ”
45223	45238	45239	45239	I	199	“ You ’re telling me you could n’t buy your way onto the bench ? ”
45243	45252	45239	45239	I	199	“ You ’re catching onto how things work . ”
45260	45276	45239	45239	I	199	“ On the contrary . I paid the coaches to keep me off those teams . ”
45277	45289	45239	45239	I	199	“ Why ? I ’ve never heard of anyone trying that . ”
45290	45301	45239	45239	I	199	“ I had no interest in being labeled a benchwarmer . ”
45302	45308	45239	45239	I	199	“ You were that bad ? ”
45309	45312	45239	45239	I	199	“ Yes . ”
45337	45354	45355	45355	He	256	“ I ’m kind of loving the fact that you ’re not the best at everything . ”
45360	45368	45355	45355	He	256	“ One thing , Zahra . One . ”
45369	45378	45379	45379	I	199	“ So did you win a bowling championship ? ”
45390	45398	45382	45382	Rowan	256	“ I do n’t lose . Ever . ”
45399	45406	45407	45407	Rowan	256	“ Your cockiness knows no bounds . ”
45495	45516	45488	45488	I	199	“ Will you help me , please ? I ’ve been told by an expert that I twist my wrist . ”
45630	45643	45644	45644	He	256	“ So , this is the way you ’re swinging your ball . ”
45659	45676	45677	45677	He	256	“ Which makes your follow through curve to the side and head straight toward the gutter . ”
45723	45727	45728	45728	He	256	“ You try . ”
45751	45759	45760	45760	He	256	“ No . Let me help you . ”
45859	45863	45851	45851	I	199	“ Try again . ”
45896	45903	45904	45904	He	256	“ Now you try by yourself . ”
45941	45951	45952	45952	He	256	“ No , but you were better this time . ”
46007	46022	46023	46023	He	256	“ Perfect . Just like that . Okay , now you try once more . ”
46125	46134	46107	46107	I	199	“ I did it ! I did it ! ”
46193	46208	46209	46210	my sister	514	“ Come on , you two ! We ’re almost out of time already ! ”
46257	46269	46270	46270	Ani	2278	“ So what do you like to do on the weekends ? ”
46400	46409	46427	46427	She	2278	“ I do n’t do much besides work . ”
46414	46417	46410	46410	She	2278	“ Boring . ”
46418	46426	46427	46427	She	2278	“ What do you do on weekends ? ”
46430	46447	46427	46427	She	2278	“ I hang out with JP . Watch movies . Go to the mall and shop ! ”
46448	46453	46454	46454	I	199	“ Sounds like fun , ”
46464	46472	46461	46461	She	2278	“ You do n’t like those things ? ”
46473	46488	46461	46461	She	2278	“ No . The idea of going to a mall makes my skin crawl . ”
46489	46496	46497	46497	Ani	2278	“ Zahra hates the mall too . ”
46500	46506	46507	46507	I	199	“ You do n’t say . ”
46615	46627	46611	46611	She	59	“ Actually , you and Zahra have a lot in common . ”
46690	46702	46703	46703	Ani	2278	“ You always find a way to bring your sister up . ”
46712	46719	46703	46703	Ani	2278	“ Because you like each other . ”
46720	46727	46728	46728	My	199	“ And you know that how ? ”
46739	46752	46703	46703	Ani	2278	“ She looks at you like she wants to have your babies . ”
46775	46785	46769	46769	I	199	“ I definitely do n’t think that ’s true . ”
46786	46798	46799	46799	She	1035	“ You ’re right . I wanted to see your reaction . ”
46804	46811	46812	46812	I	199	“ You ’re a cruel woman . ”
46822	46831	46832	46832	She	1035	“ But my sister does smile at you . ”
46843	46849	46850	46850	I	199	“ She smiles at everyone , ”
46856	46862	46850	46850	I	199	“ How would you know ? ”
46897	46904	46865	46865	Ani	2278	“ It ’s hard to miss . ”
46905	46909	46910	46910	she	1035	“ How cute ! ”
46913	46918	46910	46910	she	1035	“ I knew it ! ”
46919	46923	46865	46865	Ani	2278	“ Knew what ? ”
46924	46931	46910	46910	she	1035	“ You do like my sister . ”
46932	46939	46865	46865	Ani	2278	“ I did n’t say that . ”
46940	46947	46910	46910	she	1035	“ No , but you smiled . ”
46964	46968	46962	46962	yourself	1038	“ People smile . ”
46977	46981	46969	46969	Ani	2278	“ Not you . ”
46982	46991	46969	46969	Ani	2278	“ Let ’s pretend this conversation never happened . ”
46992	46999	47000	47000	She	1035	“ Sure , Rowan . Sure . ”
47618	47622	47623	47623	Zahra	59	“ Nice shot . ”
47628	47633	47623	47623	Zahra	59	“ You scared me ! ”
47646	47654	47634	47634	She	59	“ What are you even doing here ? ”
47666	47680	47634	47634	She	59	“ I wanted to check in and see if anyone was still working . ”
47686	47689	47690	47690	She	59	“ Why ? ”
47695	47704	47690	47690	She	59	“ I wanted someone ’s opinion on something . ”
47719	47725	47726	47726	She	59	“ Okay . Hit me . ”
47746	47753	47729	47729	she	59	“ Rowan , what is it ? ”
47754	47767	47729	47729	she	59	“ I was n’t sure if our oldest ride is worth keeping . ”
47773	47788	47768	47768	Her	59	“ Oh no ! Do n’t get rid of it . I love the — ”
47811	47816	47808	47808	I	199	“ You skipped dinner . ”
47817	47826	47830	47830	her	59	“ Umm … how did you know that ? ”
47863	47870	47837	47837	Rowan	256	“ You ’re still here working . ”
47871	47886	47887	47887	Her	59	“ Right . I ’m about to wrap up soon so I ’ll just — ”
47915	47924	47909	47909	I	199	“ How do you feel about Chinese food ? ”
47930	47937	47925	47925	Her	59	“ Umm … it ’s good ? ”
47995	47998	47984	47984	I	199	“ What ? ”
48004	48015	47999	47999	She	59	“ I did n’t expect you to buy me dinner . ”
48016	48027	48028	48028	I	199	“ I ’m hungry . You can have the leftovers , ”
48036	48048	47999	47999	She	59	“ But I ’m pretty sure you ordered the entire restaurant . ”
48070	48087	48088	48088	She	59	“ All right . So why are you thinking of getting rid of our oldest ride ? ”
48150	48156	48133	48133	Zahra	59	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
48168	48176	48157	48157	She	59	“ You ’re sitting on the floor . ”
48183	48186	48177	48177	I	199	“ And ? ”
48187	48192	48193	48193	She	59	“ It ’s weird . ”
48202	48219	48198	48198	I	199	“ It ’s an old ride . I ’m not sure if it ’s worth keeping . ”
48226	48239	48220	48220	She	59	“ You have to be joking ! Is it worth keeping ? ! ”
48340	48351	48352	48352	I	199	“ Did you really need to order the whole menu ? ”
48355	48363	48352	48352	I	199	“ Was n’t sure what you liked . ”
48373	48382	48364	48364	She	59	“ And why did n’t you ask me ? ”
48471	48481	48465	48465	I	199	“ Why were you here so late ? Really ? ”
48497	48506	48482	48482	She	59	“ I was working on a new idea . ”
48507	48510	48482	48482	She	59	“ And ? ”
48511	48519	48482	48482	She	59	“ And I lost track of time . ”
48520	48526	48482	48482	She	59	“ Does this happen often ? ”
48530	48540	48527	48527	She	59	“ I do n’t have much else going on . ”
48541	48551	48527	48527	She	59	“ What do you like to do for fun ? ”
48581	48587	48578	48578	Zahra	59	“ I like to read . ”
48588	48592	48593	48593	She	59	“ For fun ? ”
48627	48639	48640	48640	She	59	“ Yes . Some people read for something other than work . ”
48644	48657	48640	48640	She	59	“ What do you like to do when you ’re not working ? ”
48661	48665	48659	48659	you	1061	“ I run . ”
48666	48669	48670	48670	She	59	“ Figures . ”
48687	48693	48670	48670	She	59	“ What does that mean ? ”
48712	48722	48694	48694	She	59	“ Nothing . You have a runner ’s body . ”
48741	48751	48752	48752	she	59	“ Not that I check you out or anything , ”
48773	48776	48762	48762	I	199	“ Right . ”
48777	48785	48734	48734	She	59	“ Only a masochist runs for fun . ”
48786	48792	48762	48762	I	199	“ It clears my head . ”
48793	48802	48734	48734	She	59	“ I ’ll take your word for it . ”
48823	48835	48820	48820	Zahra	59	“ It ’s a shame you do n’t laugh more often . ”
48860	48868	48847	48847	I	199	“ Do n’t get used to it . ”
48869	48894	48895	48895	Her	59	“ I would n’t dare . I kind of like the fact that it ’s a rarity because it makes it even more special . ”
49218	49232	49233	49233	She	514	“ It ’s no big deal . People forget things all the time . ”
49269	49280	49281	49281	I	199	“ How did you forget two of the four pumpkins ? ”
49303	49310	49300	49300	She	514	“ The pumpkin patch ran out . ”
49311	49318	49319	49319	I	199	“ This lie is rapidly devolving . ”
49330	49336	49337	49337	Her	514	“ I ’m not lying . ”
49351	49363	49364	49364	I	199	“ They ran out of pumpkins at the beginning of October ? ”
49371	49380	49364	49364	I	199	“ How weird ! Must be a shortage . ”
49447	49457	49437	49437	Ani	2278	“ JP and I want to do one together . ”
49458	49464	49465	49465	I	199	“ You do n’t say ? ”
49523	49529	49530	49530	JP	132	“ Let ’s do this ! ”
49569	49585	49560	49560	I	199	“ You do n’t have to do this if you have something better to do . ”
49596	49612	49586	49586	He	1080	“ I would n’t have shown up if I did n’t want to do this . ”
49613	49619	49620	49620	I	199	“ Why are you here ? ”
49630	49639	49625	49625	His	1080	“ Because your sister asked me to be . ”
49676	49684	49685	49685	I	199	“ Should n’t you still be working ? ”
49715	49721	49698	49698	he	1080	“ It ’s a Saturday . ”
49731	49739	49723	49723	I	199	“ I thought you worked every day . ”
49740	49744	49698	49698	he	1080	“ I do . ”
49745	49758	49723	49723	I	199	“ We really need to talk about your work - life balance . ”
49759	49776	49698	49698	he	1080	“ It ’s easy when my life is my job . No need for a scale . ”
49786	49799	49777	49777	I	199	“ That ’s the saddest thing I ’ve ever heard you say . ”
49808	49811	49800	49800	He	1080	“ Why ? ”
49812	49834	49800	49800	He	1080	“ Because what ’s the point of having so much money when you ’ll never have the chance to enjoy it . ”
49886	49898	49868	49868	He	1080	“ If money was no object , what would you do ? ”
49902	49908	49899	49899	I	199	“ The options are endless . ”
49914	49924	49909	49909	He	1080	“ That ’s a terrifying sentiment coming from you . ”
49925	49938	49909	49909	He	1080	“ Well , for starters , I ’d give back to charity . ”
49942	49947	49939	49939	He	1080	“ We support charities . ”
49948	49975	49909	49909	He	1080	“ Only because it ’s considered a tax write - off . Have you ever attended a charity event that did n’t include champagne and caviar ? ”
49976	49986	49987	49987	His	1080	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . Caviar is disgusting . ”
50002	50034	49909	49909	He	1080	“ Well , maybe you should spend a day working at a homeless shelter . Maybe you ’d think twice about walking around in shoes worth more than someone ’s rent . ”
50035	50048	49909	49909	He	1080	“ I did n’t think my question would turn into an inquisition . ”
50052	50059	50049	50049	I	199	“ You asked . I answered . ”
50060	50077	49909	49909	He	1080	“ That ’s all you would do with your endless amount of funds ? Donate it ? ”
50083	50106	50078	50078	I	199	“ Not all of it . I ’d save some for myself and buy first edition copies of all my favorite books . ”
50107	50110	50111	50111	He	1080	“ Books . ”
50122	50138	50111	50111	He	1080	“ What about your pins ? Would n’t you want to buy more of those ? ”
50142	50148	50139	50139	I	199	“ What do you mean ? ”
50154	50162	50149	50149	His	1080	“ You would n’t buy more pins ? ”
50163	50166	50201	50201	He	1080	“ No . ”
50167	50171	50149	50149	His	1080	“ Why not ? ”
50172	50181	50201	50201	He	1080	“ Because that ’s not how it works . ”
50182	50189	50149	50149	His	1080	“ Then how does it work ? ”
50193	50200	50190	50190	I	199	“ It ’s a long story . ”
50208	50217	50201	50201	He	1080	“ And ? All we have is time . ”
50222	50235	50236	50236	I	199	“ And that ’s not something I want to share with you , ”
50262	50273	50257	50257	His	1080	“ I did n’t know it was a sensitive subject . ”
50299	50312	50319	50319	Claire	420	“ It’s … just not something I talk about with many people . ”
50321	50325	50328	50328	He	1080	“ Got it . ”
50392	50398	50399	50399	Rowan	256	“ Put the weapon down . ”
50426	50439	50440	50440	I	199	“ Out of everything on the counter , this is a weapon ? ”
50453	50466	50418	50418	His	1080	“ It is when you do n’t know what you ’re doing . ”
50467	50482	50418	50418	His	1080	“ Excuse me ? I won our apartment pumpkin - carving contest last year . ”
50488	50513	50418	50418	His	1080	“ Okay , well that ’s a stretch , but I did receive an honorable mention . They gave me a ribbon and everything . ”
50586	50589	50583	50583	he	1080	“ What ? ”
50590	50605	50579	50579	His	1080	“ Who are you , and what did you do with the real Rowan ? ”
50611	50618	50606	50606	His	1080	“ What are you talking about ? ”
50625	50633	50619	50619	I	199	“ Could you do that thing again ? ”
50634	50637	50583	50583	he	1080	“ Laugh ? ”
50638	50651	50619	50619	I	199	“ Yes . I need to catch it on camera this time . ”
50661	50665	50652	50652	He	1080	“ What for ? ”
50666	50675	50583	50583	he	1080	“ Because this is history in the making . ”
50676	50681	50682	50682	He	1080	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
50689	50693	50694	50694	I	199	“ Ridiculously amazing , ”
50731	50737	50722	50722	I	199	“ What are you doing ? ”
50752	50759	50738	50738	He	1080	“ Do n’t ask stupid questions . ”
50760	50777	50738	50738	He	1080	“ Hey ! What happened to ‘ There ’s no such thing as stupid questions ’ ? ”
50778	50789	50790	50790	he	1080	“ Want to guess who came up with that phrase ? ”
50814	50833	50738	50738	He	1080	“ I ’ll rephrase my question . Why are you choosing to carve the lid from the bottom ? ”
50849	50856	50834	50834	He	1080	“ Because the experts say so . ”
50857	50860	50909	50910	Rowan Don’t	139	“ Experts ? ”
50861	50886	50834	50834	He	1080	“ Yes . The articles I reviewed all stated that cutting a hole at the bottom prevents the pumpkin from caving in on itself . ”
50887	50898	50909	50910	Rowan Don’t	139	“ Well , wow . I did n’t know that . ”
50941	50974	50931	50932	The man	256	“ Your sister sent me a picture of you with your honorable mention - worthy pumpkin . I thought I was doing a disservice to everyone if I did n’t come prepared . ”
50975	50987	50931	50932	The man	256	“ How did you know we would be partnered up together ? ”
50993	50999	50988	50988	His	1080	“ She told me before . ”
51000	51008	51009	51009	I	199	“ And you decided to come anyway ? ”
51036	51042	51020	51020	He	1080	“ Why did you come ? ”
51043	51050	51020	51020	He	1080	“ Because I felt like it . ”
51133	51137	51138	51138	He	1080	“ Your turn . ”
51146	51154	51155	51155	I	199	“ Gross . Ani does that part . ”
51172	51178	51179	51179	I	199	“ You ’re the best ! ”
52069	52087	52058	52058	Martha	57	“ Why do you need to work at the bar ? Do n’t we pay you enough ? ”
52105	52109	52088	52088	Her	57	“ Of course . ”
52110	52126	52127	52127	I	199	“ Do n’t lie to me , Martha . I thought we had a connection . ”
52142	52160	52088	52088	Her	57	“ Sir , our connection is weaker than the dial - up internet at the local library . ”
52208	52217	52188	52188	I	199	“ Why do you have a second job ? ”
52226	52235	52218	52218	She	57	“ Do n’t make me repeat my question . ”
52236	52254	52255	52255	Martha	57	“ Because my husband has a heart condition and his medications cost more than a monthly mortgage . ”
52262	52272	52218	52218	She	57	“ Why does n’t your health insurance cover it ? ”
52313	52329	52302	52302	her	57	“ With the company health insurance policy , the copayments are severely out of budget . ”
52330	52341	52342	52342	She	57	“ And you find that your paycheck is n’t sufficient . ”
52345	52361	52342	52342	She	57	“ Some months are tougher than others . With the holidays coming up and all … ”
52399	52403	52389	52389	I	199	“ Follow me . ”
52423	52428	52411	52411	Martha	57	“ Have a seat . ”
52467	52506	52440	52440	She	57	“ I do n’t mean to be rude , but I ca n’t be late to my job . Every hour counts for someone like me because I do n’t make as much as the other young ones . ”
52528	52547	52522	52522	I	199	“ Give me a moment of your time . How long has your husband had this heart condition ? ”
52548	52563	52571	52571	She	57	“ He was diagnosed at forty - five after our grandchild passed away suddenly . ”
52575	52608	52571	52571	She	57	“ The stress did him in . Instead of attending our grandbaby ’s funeral , he was recovering in the hospital . He ’s never gotten over that still to this day . ”
52718	52724	52725	52725	Her	57	“ What are you doing ? ”
52744	52751	52738	52738	she	57	“ Consider this your Christmas bonus . ”
52752	52758	52759	52759	She	57	“ But it ’s October . ”
53003	53008	53009	53009	Jenny	75	“ Where ’s Zahra ? ”
53016	53037	53009	53009	Jenny	75	“ She ’s doing some recon work . You know , that whole ‘ boots on the ground ’ mentality . ”
53038	53053	53009	53009	Jenny	75	“ Did we sign up for a war that I did n’t know about ? ”
53060	53085	53054	53054	She	75	“ She asked me for a special kind of workday , and I ’m intrigued to see what she comes up with after it . ”
53086	53092	53009	53009	Jenny	75	“ What do you mean ? ”
53093	53107	53054	53054	She	75	“ She wants to explore the park as a guest and take notes . ”
53108	53112	53113	53113	I	199	“ A guest , ”
53134	53168	53116	53116	Her	75	“ I think the idea is genius , and I plan on doing the same for the entire team . Some are hesitant about giving up one of their unpaid vacation days though . ”
53193	53204	53188	53188	I	199	“ Consider it a paid vacation day on the house . ”
53209	53222	53205	53205	Her	75	“ Really ? We have n’t had one of those in years . ”
53980	53990	53991	53992	a guest	2354	“ Hey . You ca n’t skip the line ! ”
54035	54044	54045	54045	I	199	“ Umm . What are you doing here ? ”
54070	54078	54114	54114	Rowan	256	“ You were n’t at the warehouse . ”
54079	54088	54114	54114	Rowan	256	“ Yeah , I took the day off . ”
54089	54094	54114	54114	Rowan	256	“ So Jenny said . ”
54095	54103	54104	54104	I	199	“ Why were you looking for me ? ”
54128	54149	54119	54122	The man behind us	199	“ Excuse me . You ca n’t skip the line . We ’ve been waiting here for forty minutes already . ”
54159	54165	54150	54150	He	199	“ I own the place . ”
54166	54177	54178	54179	The man	199	“ Yeah , right . And I ’m Santa Claus . ”
54186	54197	54198	54198	Rowan	256	“ Google the name Rowan Kane . I ’ll wait . ”
54253	54279	54240	54241	The man	199	“ I ’m sorry , Mr. Kane . I did n’t mean to yell at you . We just feel strongly about line skippers here . ”
54280	54299	54300	54300	he	199	“ I ’m sure that ’s the case with anyone who ca n’t afford a quick skip pass , ”
54312	54322	54323	54323	I	199	“ You should n’t talk to people like that . ”
54454	54457	54442	54442	I	199	“ Yes ? ”
54458	54481	54442	54442	I	199	“ Are you going to finally explain why we ’re waiting in a line when we can go ahead and skip everyone ? ”
54482	54512	54442	54442	I	199	“ I ’m experiencing the park from the perspective of a guest so I can come up with ideas for the very people you ’re trying to appeal to . ”
54513	54519	54520	54520	His	199	“ How noble of you . ”
54538	54572	54442	54442	I	199	“ If you hate the idea so much , then go back to your fancy office . No one asked you to come here . Actually , wait . Why are you here ? ”
54573	54576	54577	54577	He	199	“ I — ”
54580	54586	54577	54577	He	199	“ I do n’t know . ”
54731	54738	54714	54729	A man dressed in an old - school three - piece suit calls out to us	1175	“ How many in your party ? ”
54739	54742	54743	54743	I	199	“ One , ”
54752	54755	54743	54743	I	199	“ Two . ”
54766	54777	54756	54757	The attendant	1176	“ Umm , please hurry . The cart is leaving . ”
54807	54816	54817	54817	I	199	“ Why ca n’t you leave me alone ? ”
54820	54826	54827	54827	He	1176	“ I wish I knew . ”
54932	54953	54954	54954	He	1176	“ If you scoot any closer to the edge , you ’ll fall out of the cart and get hurt . ”
54961	54969	54954	54954	He	1176	“ I thought you did n’t care ? ”
54970	54983	55032	55032	Rowan	256	“ Hmm . Maybe I found some fucks to give after all . ”
55069	55077	55054	55054	he	1176	“ That ’s creepier than I remember . ”
55083	55097	55078	55078	I	199	“ Aw , are you scared ? Want me to hold your hand ? ”
55140	55152	55153	55153	I	199	“ When is the last time you rode on this one ? ”
55167	55173	55156	55156	His	1176	“ When I was ten . ”
55174	55183	55156	55156	His	1176	“ Ten ? ! That ’s forever ago . ”
55184	55192	55156	55156	His	1176	“ Way to make me feel old . ”
55200	55203	55193	55193	My	199	“ Sorry . ”
55204	55240	55156	55156	His	1176	“ I still remember how Cal used to cry every single time . His reaction always made my mom laugh , so we would bully him into doing it with us over and over again . ”
55260	55272	55247	55247	I	199	“ That ’s sweet that you did that for your mom . ”
55276	55283	55273	55273	He	1176	“ I doubt Cal would agree . ”
55284	55291	55273	55273	He	1176	“ What was her favorite ride ? ”
55292	55297	55298	55298	He	1176	“ All of them . ”
55469	55483	55460	55460	I	199	“ Oh my God . That reaction was totally worth riding with you . ”
55503	55508	55490	55490	His	1176	“ You ’re evil . ”
55522	55525	55519	55519	Rowan	256	“ Fuck ! ”
55565	55575	55576	55576	He	1176	“ You should ’ve seen your face . Priceless . ”
55581	55595	55576	55576	He	1176	“ I think I might have peed a little from laughing so hard . ”
55596	55603	55576	55576	He	1176	“ Charming as ever , Zahra . ”
55619	55636	55637	55637	I	199	“ I ’ve never seen a grown adult react like that on a kid ’s ride . ”
55648	55675	55637	55637	I	199	“ You ’re not as sweet as everyone thinks you are . Only a wicked woman would call a man out for being afraid like this . ”
55676	55697	55698	55698	My	199	“ Do you think they have it on camera ? I ’ll buy that insanely overpriced photo in a heartbeat . ”
55822	55825	55826	55826	I	199	“ Wait ! ”
55888	55892	55893	55893	Rowan	256	“ Delete it . ”
55917	55927	55907	55907	I	199	“ No ! Please let me buy it first . ”
56049	56057	56038	56038	I	199	“ Why did you pay for it ? ”
56058	56065	56038	56038	I	199	“ Because I felt like it . ”
56152	56155	56156	56156	I	199	“ Heartburn ? ”
56165	56168	56156	56156	I	199	“ Yup . ”
56169	56188	56141	56141	He	256	“ Interesting . I always wondered if you had your heart surgically removed to save you the trouble . ”
56189	56207	56156	56156	I	199	“ I tried . Turns out the doctor did n’t feel comfortable with the low survival rate . ”
56208	56212	56141	56141	He	256	“ Those cowards . ”
56275	56300	56266	56266	I	199	“ Well , nice seeing you . I better get going — you know , places to go , rides to see and all . ”
56376	56384	56354	56354	He	256	“ Why are you really doing this ? ”
56392	56399	56385	56385	I	199	“ I have a creative block . ”
56400	56407	56408	56408	He	256	“ And this is your solution ? ”
56417	56434	56385	56385	I	199	“ Why did you agree to become the Director if you hate this place so much ? ”
56435	56442	56443	56443	His	256	“ I do n’t hate it . ”
56447	56456	56385	56385	I	199	“ Then explain that look on your face . ”
56457	56465	56385	56385	I	199	“ I do n’t answer to you . ”
56466	56484	56485	56485	I	199	“ If you act like a child , then you ’ll get treated like one . Goodbye ! ”
56511	56517	56499	56499	He	256	“ I ’m coming along . ”
56518	56521	56522	56522	I	199	“ Why ? ”
56525	56532	56533	56533	Rowan	256	“ Because I find you interesting . ”
56600	56611	56612	56612	I	199	“ We do n’t have quick skip passes for that . ”
56646	56654	56640	56640	He	256	“ You ’re looking right at it . ”
56658	56678	56655	56655	I	199	“ God , that was so corny . I ca n’t even believe it came out of your mouth . ”
56699	56728	56679	56679	He	256	“ You know , this beats the point of me experiencing Dreamland like a regular person . I like talking to people and hearing their opinions while waiting . ”
56743	56755	56756	56756	I	199	“ Why do you want to spend time with me anyway ? ”
56776	56792	56793	56793	I	199	“ You ’re not supposed to ride this roller coaster if you have heart issues , ”
56807	56819	56796	56796	He	256	“ I do not have heart issues . It ’s indigestion . ”
56820	56834	56835	56835	I	199	“ Or a chronic side effect for being an ass all the time . ”
56892	56901	56882	56882	I	199	“ That ’s where we want to sit . ”
57155	57161	57141	57141	I	199	“ What did you think ? ”
57162	57170	57171	57171	His	256	“ I think you popped my eardrums . ”
57217	57233	57197	57197	My	199	“ I could ride this over and over again and never get sick of it . ”
57239	57245	57234	57234	He	256	“ Over and over again ? ”
57246	57257	57197	57197	My	199	“ Yes ! Does n’t it make you feel alive ? ”
57284	57291	57292	57293	The passengers	1223	“ Umm . What ’s happening ? ”
57323	57331	57332	57332	I	199	“ Why are we doing this again ? ”
57350	57360	57340	57340	He	256	“ You said you wanted to do it again . ”
57361	57373	57419	57419	He	256	“ Yeah , but I did n’t exactly expect us to . ”
57374	57381	57340	57340	He	256	“ Well , here we are . ”
57393	57418	57419	57419	He	256	“ Why are you really spending so much time with me ? Do n’t you have other things to do and people to torment ? ”
57425	57433	57419	57419	He	256	“ Maybe I enjoy hearing your screams . ”
57434	57437	57419	57419	He	256	“ Freak . ”
57662	57666	57667	57667	Zahra	59	“ Hurry up ! ”
57752	57756	57757	57757	She	59	“ Come on ! ”
57765	57781	57782	57782	She	59	“ We ’re going to miss it if we do n’t pick up the pace . ”
57823	57833	57808	57808	She	59	“ How ’d you know I like hot chocolate ? ”
57834	57841	57808	57808	She	59	“ Because everyone likes hot chocolate . ”
57842	57857	57808	57808	She	59	“ I should n’t . We ’ve basically eaten everything they sell at Dreamland . ”
57858	57876	57877	57877	My	199	“ If you complain about your weight , I ’ll gouge my eyes out with this spoon . ”
57955	57964	57946	57946	Her	59	“ My ex used to call me fat . ”
58000	58012	57990	57990	I	199	“ I take it that ’s why he ’s an ex . ”
58013	58030	58040	58040	She	59	“ No . Sadly not . Although , I should ’ve taken it as a sign . ”
58031	58039	57990	57990	I	199	“ That he was losing his vision ? ”
58078	58103	58040	58040	She	59	“ Seriously , what kind of idiot complains about a woman having curves ? Off the record , your body is hot as fuck . ”
58112	58121	58104	58104	Her	59	“ Please pretend I did n’t say anything . ”
58122	58125	58142	58142	she	59	“ Why ? ”
58126	58141	58142	58142	she	59	“ Because we should n’t be having this conversation . You ’re my boss , ”
58158	58166	58153	58153	My	199	“ I ’m not technically your boss . ”
58167	58174	58142	58142	she	59	“ My contract begs to differ . ”
58175	58187	58153	58153	My	199	“ You report to Jenny , who then reports to me . ”
58188	58223	58142	58142	she	59	“ Well , you ’re my boss ’s boss , which means I should definitely not bring up my ex to you . So be a gentleman and shut up . Kay , thanks ! ”
58239	58252	58224	58224	I	199	“ Gentle is the last thing I want to be around you . ”
58260	58266	58253	58253	Her	1243	“ What are you doing ? ”
58267	58271	58301	58301	She	1243	“ Having fun . ”
58272	58284	58253	58253	Her	1243	“ Did I miss the start of the apocalypse or something ? ”
58338	58352	58353	58353	My	199	“ You ’re cute when you get all flustered . If it was — ”
58367	58374	58353	58353	My	199	“ What are they counting for ? ”
58384	58389	58375	58375	She	1243	“ You ’ll see ! ”
58462	58482	58483	58484	My parents	513	“ What the hell is this ? I do n’t remember this being here when I was a kid . ”
58507	58514	58533	58533	Her	59	“ They added it last year ! ”
58515	58521	58533	58533	Her	59	“ This better not stain . ”
58547	58558	58533	58533	Her	59	“ Do n’t be such a stick in the mud . ”
58586	58598	58559	58559	Foam	150	“ These people act like they ’ve never seen snow before . ”
58599	58609	58610	58610	She	59	“ That ’s because some of us have n’t ! ”
58617	58620	58559	58559	Foam	150	“ Really ? ”
58621	58628	58629	58629	She	59	“ Yes . Maybe one day . ”
59108	59111	59097	59097	she	59	“ So … ”
59112	59120	59121	59121	I	199	“ Go on a date with me . ”
59128	59132	59133	59133	She	59	“ What ? ! ”
59167	59173	59133	59133	She	59	“ Should I repeat myself ? ”
59174	59181	59133	59133	She	59	“ No ! To both questions . ”
59182	59185	59186	59186	I	199	“ Why ? ”
59209	59225	59133	59133	She	59	“ Do you need a bigger reason besides the fact that you ’re my boss ? ”
59226	59239	59263	59263	Her	59	“ That ’s never stopped you from doing what you wanted before . ”
59247	59262	59240	59240	Her	59	“ It does n’t matter . You ’re the last person I should want . ”
59292	59329	59263	59263	Her	59	“ Yeah , well , I ’m not supposed to be attracted to an insufferable female who drives me to the brink of insanity yet here we are . You represent everything I dislike in someone . ”
59333	59344	59330	59330	She	59	“ That ’s the way you really feel about me ? ”
59383	59394	59395	59395	I	199	“ Shit . I did n’t mean it like that . ”
59407	59460	59461	59461	Her	59	“ You know what ? Forget this . All I ’ve done is make excuses for your behavior because I was hoping there was a decent guy underneath all that anger . But in reality , you ’re nothing but a jerk who gets off on making everyone as miserable as you . ”
59524	59535	59520	59520	My	199	“ Zahra , I ’m sorry . Hear me out — ”
59536	59561	59520	59520	My	199	“ I do n’t want your apology . It means nothing coming from someone who would n’t know the first thing about feeling remorseful . ”
59693	59704	59705	59705	She	1261	“ Forget this kiss happened . God knows I will . ”
60169	60173	60164	60164	his	256	“ Come in . ”
60341	60346	60347	60347	He	256	“ Have a seat . ”
60426	60431	60432	60432	I	199	“ What ’s this ? ”
60438	60451	60432	60432	I	199	“ Please tell me that ’s not an NDA or something nefarious . ”
60469	60476	60458	60458	I	199	“ No . Nothing like that . ”
60477	60481	60482	60482	He	256	“ Okay then … ”
60492	60501	60482	60482	He	256	“ I brought you here under false pretenses . ”
60502	60509	60458	60458	I	199	“ I ’m sorry . What ? ”
60510	60519	60520	60520	He	256	“ Hear me out before you do anything . ”
60529	60534	60458	60458	I	199	“ Umm … okay ? ”
60545	60586	60535	60535	He	256	“ I made a decision a few months ago that had a longer - lasting impact than I intended . While it was n’t made with the most favorable intention at the time , it quickly became something I enjoyed . ”
60587	60593	60594	60594	He	256	“ I ’m not following . ”
60602	60616	60594	60594	He	256	“ I do n’t know how to say this without making you upset . ”
60639	60644	60645	60645	My	199	“ Well , try . ”
60674	60678	60663	60663	He	256	“ Open it . ”
60747	60754	60755	60755	My	199	“ Did Scott send you these ? ”
60775	60793	60770	60770	He	256	“ Am I in trouble ? I thought it was okay for me to work with him . ”
60794	60803	60770	60770	He	256	“ No . You ’re not in trouble . ”
60804	60812	60770	60770	He	256	“ But how do you have these ? ”
60819	60826	60813	60813	He	256	“ Because there is no Scott . ”
60836	60842	60827	60827	My	199	“ What do you mean ? ”
60847	60862	60843	60843	His	256	“ I ’m the one who ’s been talking to you this whole time . ”
60887	60893	60894	60894	I	199	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
60906	60909	60894	60894	I	199	“ No . ”
61189	61192	61174	61174	I	199	“ Why ? ”
61238	61273	61231	61231	His	2149	“ At first , I was n’t sure about your motives . Texting you was supposed to be a way to make sure you were n’t secretly conspiring against me after our first kiss . ”
61279	61287	61275	61275	he	2149	“ You wanted to spy on me ? ”
61288	61304	61231	61231	His	2149	“ No . Not spy . I was checking to make sure you were genuine . ”
61344	61373	61341	61341	He	2149	“ But I realized I was foolish because you really are this kind - hearted person who wanted to entertain some lonely guy you ’d never even met . ”
61374	61383	61384	61384	I	199	“ A person who does n’t even exist , ”
61387	61435	61341	61341	He	2149	“ I ’m him . I swear I never lied to you as Scott besides the obvious . And once I realized the mistake I made , I could n’t stop . I started looking forward to our conversations , and I knew you would be upset — ”
61446	61449	61436	61436	I	199	“ Stop . ”
61456	61498	61450	61450	He	1283	“ I never meant for everything to get so … out of control . There were plenty of times I considered admitting the truth because I wanted you to look at me the same way you looked at your damn phone . ”
61516	61523	61509	61509	I	199	“ Consider the feeling long gone . ”
61529	61536	61524	61524	His	1283	“ You ca n’t mean that . ”
61537	61548	61549	61549	He	1283	“ Really ? What exactly do you feel toward me ? ”
61558	61568	61549	61549	He	1283	“ I want to spend more time around you . ”
61576	61605	61549	61549	He	1283	“ Your feelings are irrelevant . I do n’t care what you want because I ’m not open to any of it . This was all a mistake . ”
61624	61644	61645	61645	His	1283	“ I had every intention to stop messaging you , but I could n’t find the courage to stop . ”
61685	61698	61699	61699	My	199	“ I ca n’t trust you when all you do is lie . ”
61710	61742	61743	61743	He	1283	“ I promise that every conversation we had was real . The person I am with you … that ’s who I am . You probably know me better than anyone . ”
61749	61755	61756	61756	I	199	“ I do n’t care . ”
61776	61785	61756	61756	I	199	“ I swear I wanted to tell you . ”
61786	61799	61756	61756	I	199	“ But let me guess — there was never a right time . ”
61810	61843	61803	61803	I	199	“ You liars are all the same . It ’s amazing how no matter the circumstance , people like you find a way to justify your actions with the same cliché reason . ”
61890	61897	61885	61885	He	1283	“ I understand you ’re upset — ”
61905	61916	61885	61885	He	1283	“ Upset does n’t begin to cover how I feel . ”
61987	61993	61994	61994	He	1283	“ What are you doing ? ”
61999	62009	61994	61994	He	1283	“ I ’m leaving . We ’re done here . ”
62010	62029	61974	61974	I	199	“ That ’s it ? I deserve an opportunity to explain myself and make it up to you . ”
62035	62057	62030	62030	I	199	“ Are you for real ? You deserve nothing but a courtesy hello whenever we pass each other in a hallway . ”
62058	62091	61974	61974	I	199	“ You ’re going to throw months of friendship away because of this ? I ’m coming clean now when I did n’t need to . Does n’t that count for something ? ”
62145	62175	62176	62176	I	199	“ We were never friends to begin with . You made sure of that when you decided to lie to me as Scott while manipulating my attraction for Rowan . ”
62182	62239	62176	62176	I	199	“ Maybe the reason you do n’t have friends has nothing to do with being awkward or wanting to protect yourself from other people . It ’s because you are so damn cynical about everyone and everything . Who would want to open themselves up to someone like that ? I sure as hell do n’t . ”
62278	62339	62267	62267	I	199	“ Maybe one day you ’ll be open to the idea of showing the world the real you , rather than hiding behind your mask of indifference . Life ’s too short to hide who you are because you ’re afraid of getting hurt . Just like life ’s too short for me to give someone like you another chance . ”
62475	62479	62460	62460	her	420	“ What happened ? ”
62484	62488	62480	62480	I	199	“ Remember Scott ? ”
62489	62496	62497	62497	She	420	“ How can anyone forget Scott ? ”
62510	62532	62533	62533	My	199	“ Well , I plan on it . I want to pretend he never existed , seeing as he never did . ”
62537	62564	62480	62480	I	199	“ What are you even talking about ? Was he a grandpa after all ? I had a feeling after he quoted Casablanca that one time . ”
62565	62584	62585	62585	She	420	“ No . I wish that was my issue . That would be way easier than the alternative . ”
62595	62599	62585	62585	She	420	“ What happened ? ”
62605	62613	62600	62600	My	199	“ Turns out Scott is actually Rowan . ”
62621	62632	62614	62614	Her	420	“ Oh . Wow . I did n’t expect that . ”
62641	62647	62633	62633	I	199	“ You and me both . ”
62648	62655	62685	62685	She	420	“ How did you find out ? ”
62691	62701	62685	62685	She	420	“ Well , this is n’t the worst news . ”
62702	62713	62714	62714	I	199	“ How could you even say that ? He lied ! ”
62725	62753	62685	62685	She	420	“ Sure . I ’m not excusing that . But at least now you do n’t have to feel guilty about being interested in both of them . ”
62754	62768	62685	62685	She	420	“ That ’s because I ’m not interested in either of them anymore . ”
62769	62783	62685	62685	She	420	“ Well , shit . Of course not . He really screwed up . ”
62784	62794	62795	62795	I	199	“ I thought … He seemed — I mean … ”
63757	63765	63748	63748	I	199	“ I come bearing an apology dinner . ”
63785	63791	63792	63792	She	420	“ I ’m not interested . ”
63850	63866	63867	63867	I	199	“ How about some apology cupcakes I made myself ? Ani gave me her recipe . ”
63910	63920	63902	63902	Her	420	“ Are you here for work - related reasons ? ”
63930	63933	63921	63921	I	199	“ No . ”
63934	63948	63902	63902	Her	420	“ Then get out . I do n’t want to talk to you . ”
63978	64007	63954	63954	Zahra	420	“ At least give me a chance to explain . I did n’t go about things the right way the first time , but I have a reason . ”
64008	64021	64022	64022	She	420	“ There ’s no reason in the world that is good enough . ”
64141	64160	64185	64185	She	420	“ Zahra , I should n’t have lied about Scott . I used him as a way to — ”
64178	64184	64161	64161	My	199	“ Where are you going ? ”
64194	64207	64185	64185	She	420	“ I ’m going home . Maybe you should do the same . ”
64263	64274	64238	64238	she	420	“ So let ’s say someone hypothetically hurt your sister . ”
64275	64279	64280	64280	Ani	2278	“ Oh no . ”
64305	64308	64296	64296	I	199	“ What ? ”
64309	64319	64329	64329	she	420	“ You ’re the one who hurt my sister ? ”
64320	64323	64329	64329	she	420	“ No . ”
64333	64340	64341	64341	Ani	2278	“ I knew she was upset ! ”
64354	64360	64351	64351	I	199	“ What do you mean ? ”
64361	64382	64329	64329	she	420	“ Because she canceled on us for dinner . She only misses family time when she ’s sad or sick . ”
64393	64398	64390	64390	I	199	“ I messed up . ”
64404	64408	64399	64399	Ani	2278	“ I see . ”
64409	64416	64399	64399	Ani	2278	“ How can I fix it ? ”
64417	64424	64399	64399	Ani	2278	“ Depends on what you did . ”
64448	64458	64459	64459	I	199	“ Well , it started with a bad idea . ”
64495	64501	64459	64459	I	199	“ What ? Say something . ”
64505	64520	64502	64502	She	420	“ She really liked Scott . I heard her talk about him to Claire . ”
64524	64545	64521	64521	I	199	“ Help me come up with an idea on how to get her back and I ’ll owe you anything . ”
64546	64549	64521	64521	I	199	“ Anything ? ”
64561	64583	64553	64553	Ani	2278	“ I do n’t know . If she thinks you ’re like Lance , she might never give you another chance . ”
64594	64612	64584	64584	I	199	“ Okay . That ’s fair . But if you were me , what would you do ? ”
64613	64629	64630	64630	Ani	2278	“ Easy . Give her a reason to trust you . A really good reason . ”
64666	64681	64709	64709	she	420	“ How do I do that ? She does n’t believe anything I say . ”
64682	64693	64709	64709	she	420	“ You ’re a smart guy . Figure it out . ”
64807	64813	64814	64814	Her	420	“ We need to talk . ”
64838	64848	64814	64814	Her	420	“ It ’s considered rude to ignore your boss . ”
64894	64899	64881	64881	She	420	“ Give it back . ”
64900	64903	64881	64881	She	420	“ No . ”
64908	64916	64904	64904	Her	420	“ You ’re acting like a child . ”
64969	64975	64976	64976	I	199	“ You ’re not quitting . ”
65074	65084	65069	65069	She	420	“ You ca n’t force me to stay here . ”
65085	65089	65069	65069	She	420	“ I could . ”
65095	65104	65090	65090	She	420	“ No . Things are getting too complicated . ”
65105	65110	65069	65069	She	420	“ Then uncomplicate them . ”
65111	65131	65132	65132	She	420	“ I ca n’t simply shut off my feelings and carry on with life like none of this happened . ”
65141	65150	65132	65132	She	420	“ I did n’t mean to hurt you . ”
65162	65196	65197	65197	Her	420	“ You lied about who you were for months . I felt guilty for being interested in two different guys while you knew the entire time who I was . That ’s cruel . ”
65325	65342	65290	65290	Her	420	“ Give me one chance to explain myself . If you ’re not convinced that I ’m sorry”—my
65347	65363	65290	65290	Her	420	habit—“then I wo n’t bother you about this again . I ’ll let you quit . ”
65364	65367	65368	65368	Her	420	“ Really ? ”
65384	65390	65374	65374	Her	420	“ With severance and everything . ”
65394	65404	65391	65391	She	420	“ Okay . One try . I mean it . ”
65443	65446	65447	65447	I	199	“ Perfect . ”
65496	65503	65504	65504	I	199	“ I ’ll see you tonight . ”
65540	65544	65545	65545	she	420	“ Tonight ? ! ”
65564	65577	65548	65548	I	199	“ First rule of business — always discuss the terms before agreeing . ”
65783	65786	65780	65780	I	199	“ Hi . ”
65901	65911	65912	65912	I	199	“ This seems an awful lot like a date , ”
65918	65930	65912	65912	I	199	“ Do n’t be difficult . I know you ’re hungry . ”
66004	66013	65999	65999	I	199	“ Well . Let ’s hear your apology . ”
66014	66018	66035	66035	He	63	“ Eat first . ”
66038	66051	66035	66035	He	63	“ Please eat ? I do n’t want it to get cold . ”
66121	66128	66141	66145	the queen of casual conversations	1328	“ So you like to draw ? ”
66174	66181	66164	66164	He	63	“ I used to love drawing . ”
66182	66188	66164	66164	He	63	“ Why did you stop ? ”
66200	66211	66189	66189	Rowan	256	“ Why do most people stop doing things they love ? ”
66367	66381	66357	66357	I	199	“ I ’m not asking about people . I ’m asking about you . ”
66382	66397	66410	66410	He	572	“ You ’re not going to make this easy for me , are you ? ”
66398	66409	66357	66357	I	199	“ If apologizing was easy , everyone would do it . ”
66440	66453	66410	66410	He	572	“ My grandpa got me into drawing at a very young age . ”
66466	66509	66410	66410	He	572	“ He always had a special something with my brothers and me , and drawing happened to be our thing . I was the only artistic one of my family besides him so I think he enjoyed having that kind of connection . ”
66510	66515	66410	66410	He	572	“ That ’s sweet . ”
66525	66592	66516	66516	His	572	“ The bond I had with my grandfather was different from the one I shared with my father . And I think that frustrated my father . He was never artsy and that was all I wanted to do as a kid . It was like he did n’t know how to connect with me in a way that did n’t involve throwing a ball around . ”
66607	66628	66629	66629	He	572	“ I do n’t remember my parents arguing much , but when they did , it was usually about me . ”
66632	66687	66629	66629	He	572	“ Dad would get angry because he did n’t know how to bond with me , so Mom would cry . It got particularly worse once my mom got sick . I think she was worried my father and I would never be close , and she would n’t be there to help us . ”
66700	66705	66688	66688	My	199	“ Cancer , right ? ”
66713	66718	66719	66719	I	199	“ I ’m sorry . ”
66741	66774	66730	66730	He	572	“ That was the start of my rocky relationship with my father . Eventually , I gave up on drawing and moved on to more appropriate activities that were expected of me . ”
66834	66842	66814	66814	he	256	“ What made you want to stop ? ”
66843	66848	66814	66814	he	256	“ It’s … complex . ”
66860	66955	66857	66857	he	256	“ He might have not intentionally told me to stop , but he made sure to take the joy out of it . Whenever I had an exhibition , he would n’t show up , so I had to watch all the other kids ’ parents celebrate while I stood there by myself . It got to the point that I refused to participate anymore , despite my grandfather trying . Then there was a time that he found all the old cards I drew for my mom while she was in the hospital — ”
66960	66991	66857	66857	he	256	“ He ruined them because he felt like it . They were some of the last memories I had of her , and they were gone after a drunken rampage . ”
66992	66996	66857	66857	he	256	“ Drunken rampage ? ”
67004	67012	67000	67000	his	256	“ Forget I said anything about that . ”
67029	67041	67042	67042	I	199	“ It ’s okay if you ca n’t talk about it . ”
67054	67061	67062	67062	He	256	“ I owe you after everything . ”
67084	67112	67074	67074	I	199	“ I ’m not going to use an apology as a way to pull information out of you . It ’s your choice to share your past . ”
67132	67137	67120	67120	his	256	“ You mean that ? ”
67138	67161	67113	67113	He	256	“ Of course . But will you tell me what made you want to start drawing again ? If that ’s okay . ”
67165	67182	67162	67162	He	256	“ Because your drawings were terrible , and I had this burning desire to help you . ”
67183	67192	67120	67120	his	256	“ You started drawing again because of me ? ”
67193	67196	67197	67197	he	256	“ Yes , ”
67208	67215	67197	67197	he	256	“ Oh , wow . Why ? ”
67216	67225	67120	67120	his	256	“ You almost cried during your first presentation . ”
67226	67229	67197	67197	he	256	“ And ? ”
67261	67299	67300	67300	He	256	“ In the beginning , I only wanted to help you because I thought it was beneficial for me . You have the kind of talent I was looking for to renovate the park and make sure — ”
67310	67315	67331	67331	he	256	“ Make sure what ? ”
67316	67325	67326	67326	He	256	“ Make sure I make my grandfather happy . ”
67342	67357	67331	67331	he	256	“ I understand . You have a lot of pressure riding on this project . ”
67358	67364	67365	67365	he	256	“ You have no idea , ”
67371	67383	67331	67331	he	256	“ Why did n’t you hire someone else to help me ? ”
67384	67395	67331	67331	he	256	“ I thought of it but did n’t want to . ”
67396	67399	67331	67331	he	256	“ Why ? ”
67400	67408	67331	67331	he	256	“ Because my common sense escaped me . ”
67409	67415	67416	67416	I	199	“ Or you liked me . ”
67427	67444	67331	67331	he	256	“ Definitely not . I found you oddly annoying and way too nice at the time . ”
67458	67471	67445	67445	I	199	“ Hey ! There ’s no such thing as being too nice . ”
67472	67480	67331	67331	he	256	“ There is where I come from . ”
67481	67486	67445	67445	I	199	“ And that is ? ”
67496	67533	67487	67487	His	256	“ A place where people smile too brightly or talk too sweetly because they have every intention of using it against me . It ’s the whole damn reason I ’m cynical in the first place . ”
67534	67539	67331	67331	he	256	“ That sounds awful . ”
67540	67583	67487	67487	His	256	“ I ’m sure you would be horrified to know what kind of people are lurking beyond the park ’s pearly gates . Dreamland really is some fantasy . It ’s like this whole damn place is untouched by the real world . ”
67584	67607	67331	67331	he	256	“ Tell me about what you had to deal with then . Help me understand why you are the way you are . ”
67616	67623	67608	67608	His	256	“ You really want to know ? ”
67627	67636	67624	67624	I	199	“ Fine . But it ’s not pretty . ”
67637	67644	67669	67669	He	256	“ The truth usually is n’t . ”
67680	67708	67669	67669	He	256	“ My first real taste of the scum of the Earth started in college when a random girl invited me back to her dorm after a party . ”
67724	67752	67669	67669	He	256	“ Before , I had only dealt with the typical stupid teen stuff — like people using me for a private jet or a trip to Cabo . ”
67753	67761	67669	67669	He	256	“ Oh yeah , the typical stuff . ”
67772	67848	67762	67762	He	256	“ Well , where I came from , people have used me throughout my life , but it had never taken a turn toward anything illegal until I became an adult . College was eye - opening . I lost my virginity while unknowingly being filmed with a hidden camera . It cost my father a lot of money to sweep that issue under the rug before she went to the media with the tape . ”
67861	67885	67851	67851	I	199	“ Are you serious ? That ’s disgusting ! Why would you pay her off ? She ’s the one in the wrong . ”
67886	67920	67931	67931	He	256	“ Because I was n’t going to risk it . A tape like that could be devastating if it got out , so we paid her to stay quiet and turn it over . ”
67966	67988	67931	67931	He	256	“ That was only my first experience . College was full of shit but even that was tame compared to adulthood . ”
67989	68000	67931	67931	He	256	“ Oh God . There are things worse than blackmail ? ”
68021	68060	68018	68018	He	256	“ I ’ve dealt with it all . Women stabbing sealed condoms with safety pins when they thought I was n’t looking . Someone trying to drug my drink at a bar . There was this one ti — ”
68066	68080	68061	68061	I	199	“ How could you talk about this like it does n’t bother you ? ”
68084	68113	68081	68081	He	256	“ Because I got to a point where I learned to expect it from other people . You ca n’t be bothered by something you already anticipate happening . ”
68114	68126	68127	68127	I	199	“ I thought these kinds of things only happened in movies . ”
68156	68188	68127	68127	I	199	“ I ’m only scraping the surface . Each situation was a learning lesson for me — a way to prove that my brothers were right about how shitty people are . ”
68193	68206	68189	68189	My	199	“ How did you survive growing up in a place like that ? ”
68207	68224	68225	68225	I	199	“ Because you either bend to the will of monsters or you easily become the prey . ”
68245	68266	68189	68189	My	199	“ Is that why you lied ? Because you ’re so used to people doing the same thing to you ? ”
68286	68317	68323	68323	He	256	“ I did it because I thought I was justified . I had no reason to trust you at all , and I never imagined I would feel all this . ”
68318	68322	68361	68361	He	256	“ Feel what ? ”
68332	68342	68323	68323	He	256	“ I ’m bound to fuck all this up . ”
68349	68360	68343	68343	I	199	“ Okay , well , try your best not to . ”
68369	68410	68361	68361	He	256	“ My initial reason for speaking to you was selfish and cruel . I was interested in uncovering the kind of person you were . I honestly thought you were a fraud , and I wanted to prove myself right . ”
68436	68458	68517	68517	My	199	“ I feel sorry for someone like you who grew up surrounded by so many vicious people . I really do . ”
68464	68478	68459	68459	His	256	“ There ’s a reason we live by the motto money over morals . ”
68479	68503	68517	68517	My	199	“ There are two ways to be rich in life , and one of them has nothing to do with a bank account . ”
68504	68516	68459	68459	His	256	“ I see that now . I see that in you . ”
68546	68617	68539	68539	His	256	“ I thought you would extort me for money after that kiss . Part of me anticipated it , if only to prove you were just as selfish as the rest of us . Because how could you not want to milk me for money if I harassed you like I did . There were times I even wondered if you would attempt something else to only exacerbate the issue . ”
68618	68634	68700	68700	he	256	“ That ’s sad , Rowan . I told you I would n’t do that . ”
68635	68647	68539	68539	His	256	“ I do n’t have a good track history with trust . ”
68648	68654	68700	68700	he	256	“ Yeah , I see . ”
68729	68763	68764	68764	My	199	“ You proved me wrong every time you spoke to me . You did n’t even know who I was and you were willing to make me feel like I mattered to someone . ”
68778	68797	68798	68798	His	199	“ I was proud to make your drawings . It made me feel happy to make you happy . ”
68816	68856	68811	68811	His	199	“ As I spent time getting to know you , I confirmed my deepest suspicion in a completely different way . You are so much more than you let on — but in a way that makes you priceless . ”
68867	68947	68857	68857	Priceless	145	“ You ’re selfless , caring , and willing to go above and beyond to help those around you . You tutor kids for free , and you bring a grumpy old man bread and cookies . And the selfish part of me wanted to steal a piece of you for myself . You reminded me of what it was like to not feel so damn lonely all the time , and I did n’t want to lose that . ”
68969	68991	68857	68857	Priceless	145	“ I took your kindness for granted , and I abused your trust . So for that , I ’m sorry . ”
68998	69006	68992	68992	I	199	“ What made you want to confess ? ”
69007	69113	69114	69114	Wetness	154	“ I could n’t keep pretending after our day at Dreamland . I became addicted to the way you made me feel , to the point that I could n’t find a way to tell you who I really was . I was afraid and I did n’t want it to end . So , instead of giving myself up , I found ways to spend time with you as Rowan while purposefully stealing the rest of your attention as Scott . It was a stupid idea . It was unfair of me , but I do n’t regret a single thing except hurting you . ”
69244	69251	69240	69240	My	199	“ What about the buddies program ? ”
69255	69265	69252	69252	He	256	“ God . I ’m going to sound crazy . ”
69274	69283	69269	69269	my	199	“ Maybe I like your kind of crazy . ”
69303	69327	69252	69252	He	256	“ I ’m the one who stole all the papers except for one because I did n’t want anyone to have your number . ”
69333	69337	69328	69328	My	199	“ You what ? ”
69360	69439	69348	69348	He	256	“ When you caught me , I was angry at myself for feeling so stupid , and I took it out on you . But then once I showed up at the meeting , I realized what you were trying to do for people like your sister . I attended the first one for purely selfish reasons , but I stayed because I like Ani . She makes me laugh and she ’s sweet , just like you . ”
69524	69539	69517	69517	My	199	“ Why are you smiling ? Did you not hear a thing I said ? ”
69540	69545	69546	69546	I	199	“ You like me , ”
69550	69570	69517	69517	My	199	“ No . I tolerate you more than most people . That ’s why I want to date you . ”
69583	69589	69517	69517	My	199	“ You find this funny ? ”
69590	69599	69517	69517	My	199	“ A little . But it ’s cute . ”
69608	69619	69600	69600	He	256	“ You do n’t like the idea of liking me . ”
69620	69689	69690	69690	He	256	“ I ca n’t promise you that I wo n’t mess up again . I ’m learning as I go , but there ’s something about you that makes me happy in a way I have n’t felt before . So , if you want to quit , I understand , but go knowing that I never wanted to harm you or make you feel like a fool . ”
69717	69741	69765	69765	I	199	“ I think part of me wants to dislike you for being mistrusting , but part of me ca n’t help but relate . ”
69749	69764	69742	69742	He	256	“ What do you mean ? You ’re the most trusting person of all . ”
69786	69819	69773	69773	he	256	“ My boyfriend at the time broke my heart and my trust the day I found him with another woman . She — God . It ’s something I can never unsee . ”
69840	69869	69773	69773	he	256	“ And because one blow to my life was n’t enough , Lance — my ex — demolished a part of my heart I ’ll never get back . ”
69870	69876	69877	69877	His	199	“ What did he do ? ”
69902	69926	69892	69892	I	199	“ He stole my Nebula Land submission , impressed the Creators , and used the bonus to buy his lover an engagement ring . ”
69959	69977	69941	69941	He	199	“ While I ’m sorry he hurt you , I ’m not sorry he let you go . ”
69985	69992	69978	69978	I	199	“ Are you always so selfish ? ”
69997	70003	69993	69993	His	199	“ With you , yes . ”
70034	70069	70009	70009	He	199	“ I might be many things but I ’m no cheater . And while I lied to you about everything before , I wo n’t do it anymore . That I can assure you . ”
70080	70101	70070	70070	I	199	“ So that ’s it ? I ’m supposed to take your word for it and hope for the best ? ”
70102	70113	70119	70119	He	199	“ No , I know firsthand how words mean nothing . ”
70114	70118	70070	70070	I	199	“ Then what ? ”
70131	70139	70119	70119	He	199	“ I ’ll prove it to you . ”
70140	70144	70119	70119	He	199	“ How so ? ”
70157	70167	70168	70168	His	199	“ Would you rather me show or tell you ? ”
70265	70273	70274	70274	I	199	“ What ’s it going to be ? ”
70287	70292	70274	70274	I	199	“ Show or tell ? ”
70371	70377	70361	70361	She	1351	“ Show . Always show . ”
70401	70410	70385	70385	I	199	“ There ’s no going back after this . ”
70411	70422	70423	70423	She	1351	“ I say there ’s no time like the present . ”
70798	70810	70790	70790	I	199	“ If you want to stop , now ’s the time . ”
70816	70819	70811	70811	She	1351	“ What ? ”
70820	70830	70811	70811	She	1351	“ If you do n’t want to keep going — ”
70958	70963	70939	70939	I	199	“ Enjoying the show ? ”
70964	70977	70939	70939	I	199	“ I like how you look begging on your hands and knees . ”
70978	70984	70939	70939	I	199	“ I do n’t beg . ”
70985	70990	70939	70939	I	199	“ Practice makes perfect . ”
71380	71387	71366	71366	I	199	“ Did I meet your expectations ? ”
71388	71404	71366	71366	I	199	“ I could n’t spell the word expectations , let alone define them right now . ”
71419	71426	71427	71427	She	1351	“ You have the best laugh . ”
71570	71578	71555	71555	I	199	“ This is n’t about me tonight . ”
71606	71619	71603	71603	She	1351	“ You do n’t want me to help you with that problem ? ”
71620	71629	71603	71603	She	1351	“ Take a man out to dinner first . ”
71630	71636	71603	71603	She	1351	“ Does my pussy count ? ”
71637	71640	71603	71603	She	1351	“ Fuck . ”
71678	71689	71690	71690	Her	1351	“ Stop being noble . It does n’t suit you . ”
71721	71732	71699	71699	She	1351	“ I ca n’t offer anything more than something casual . ”
71742	71747	71733	71733	She	1351	“ That ’s fine . ”
71760	71765	71750	71750	I	199	“ I mean it . ”
71771	71790	71766	71766	She	1351	“ I ’m sure you do . Now stop being a cliché and get on with the show . ”
71810	71815	71796	71796	Zahra	256	“ This is unfair . ”
71816	71828	71829	71829	I	199	“ You wo n’t be complaining in a couple of minutes . ”
71913	71932	71885	71885	She	1351	“ Just to be clear , should I scream your name or Scott ’s when you fuck me ? ”
71953	71958	71942	71942	she	1351	“ I dare you . ”
71970	71988	71989	71989	I	199	“ Spoiler warning — if you do , you might not be able to walk home tomorrow . ”
72016	72022	72023	72023	Her	1351	“ Walking is overrated anyway . ”
72184	72193	72194	72194	she	1351	“ Fuck me like you mean it already , ”
72255	72262	72249	72249	I	199	“ I have one last question . ”
72317	72337	72312	72312	her	1351	“ Do you still want that measuring tape ? I can go find one now and settle the debate . ”
72338	72354	72312	72312	her	1351	“ All good . I ’m pretty sure I can feel you in my throat . ”
72813	72819	72820	72820	his	256	“ What are you doing ? ”
72824	72828	72829	72829	I	199	“ Getting dressed ? ”
72914	72917	72902	72902	Rowan	256	“ So … ”
72968	72973	72974	72974	His	256	“ You ’re leaving ? ”
73019	73029	73007	73007	I	199	“ Umm . Is n’t that what you want ? ”
73030	73037	73077	73077	his	256	“ What gave you that idea ? ”
73038	73046	73047	73047	My	199	“ Well — umm . You see … ”
73058	73064	73077	73077	his	256	“ You want to go . ”
73107	73115	73116	73116	I	199	“ Do you want me to stay ? ”
73150	73161	73189	73189	Rowan	256	“ I would n’t not like it if you stayed . ”
73165	73181	73162	73162	I	199	“ Oh God . You use double negatives . This was doomed from the start . ”
73209	73216	73199	73199	I	199	“ I did that on purpose . ”
73217	73222	73223	73223	I	199	“ Sure you did . ”
73331	73344	73321	73321	Rowan	256	“ Which version of Pride and Prejudice are you up for tonight ? ”
73345	73357	73321	73321	Rowan	256	“ Maybe I ’m in the mood for some horror film . ”
73358	73366	73321	73321	Rowan	256	“ Is n’t romance considered a subgenre ? ”
73376	73386	73367	73367	I	199	“ Now you ’re just trying to be funny . ”
73387	73401	73402	73402	He	256	“ Trying ? I seem to recall you thinking I ’m quite funny . ”
73422	73432	73367	73367	I	199	“ I found the secret to making you smile ! ”
73433	73436	73453	73453	he	256	“ What ? ”
73437	73450	73367	73367	I	199	“ Orgasms ! Why did n’t I think of it sooner ? ! ”
73521	73530	73512	73512	He	256	“ Pick or I ’ll pick for you . ”
73570	73582	73555	73555	he	256	“ I ’m in a Matthew MacFadyen kind of mood tonight . ”
74005	74008	73995	73995	I	199	“ Claire ? ”
74133	74144	74119	74119	I	199	“ Who ’s got you in such a good mood ? ”
74160	74175	74150	74150	She	420	“ Zahra ! You ’re home ! I did n’t hear you come in . ”
74176	74186	74150	74150	She	420	“ That ’s because you were a bit busy . ”
74190	74198	74187	74187	Claire	420	“ I ’ve got something to share . ”
74199	74203	74204	74204	I	199	“ Me too . ”
74207	74211	74212	74212	we	1380	“ You first , ”
74227	74232	74222	74222	Her	420	“ I met someone ! ”
74233	74238	74262	74262	She	420	“ Tell me more . ”
74239	74251	74222	74222	Her	420	“ Well , remember that sous chef from The Royal Chateau ? ”
74252	74261	74262	74262	She	420	“ How could one forget Her Royal Crankiness ? ”
74275	74281	74262	74262	She	420	“ Well , she apologized . ”
74282	74288	74262	74262	She	420	“ What ? ! How ? ”
74289	74306	74262	74262	She	420	“ We ran into each other at the grocery store . It was like a movie . ”
74307	74310	74262	74262	She	420	“ How ? ”
74311	74356	74262	74262	She	420	“ Well , I saw her and panicked . I accidentally ran my cart into a stand full of oranges , and they toppled over in my rush . It was hands down the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to me in public . ”
74357	74375	74262	74262	She	420	“ That ca n’t possibly be true . Remember that time we were at the football game — ”
74379	74393	74376	74376	Claire	420	“ Even worse . She ended up slipping on an orange and falling . ”
74394	74399	74376	74376	Claire	420	“ And then what ? ”
74400	74422	74376	74376	Claire	420	“ She laughed up to the ceiling after I did a terrible ‘ Orange you glad to see me ’ joke . ”
74491	74496	74464	74464	she	420	“ Tell me everything ! ”
74519	74534	74483	74483	Claire	420	“ So please tell me that Rowan ’s looks are n’t just for show . ”
74535	74546	74547	74547	I	199	“ He ’s more of an action kind of guy . ”
74559	74588	74556	74556	Claire	420	“ Great . I ’m glad we now know he can use his tongue for good rather than evil . It ’s a step in the right direction . ”
74595	74604	74556	74556	Claire	420	“ So you ’re what ? Fuck buddies ? ”
74613	74618	74619	74619	She	420	“ Okay . No . ”
74622	74629	74619	74619	She	420	“ How about friends with benefits ? ”
74635	74642	74630	74630	I	199	“ We did n’t discuss labels . ”
74643	74658	74676	74676	She	420	“ Silly me . How could you with his dick lodged in your throat . ”
74672	74675	74659	74659	My	199	“ Claire ! ”
74681	74691	74676	74676	She	420	“ What ? ! You walked into that one . ”
74692	74728	74676	74676	She	420	“ We did n’t define what we are because there is no us . At least not in that sense of the word . We ’re just Zahra and Rowan . Two people having fun . ”
74746	74762	74735	74735	her	420	“ I do n’t want you getting hurt . Casual relationships are n’t your thing . ”
74763	74788	74676	74676	She	420	“ Maybe that ’s my problem . With Lance , we dove headfirst into a relationship . I ’m looking to take things slow . ”
74789	74813	74735	74735	her	420	“ Well , hate to break it to you , but you drove past a red light at two hundred miles an hour . ”
74821	74827	74819	74819	me	199	“ It ’s just sex . ”
74828	74849	74873	74873	She	420	“ Yeah , and he ’s just the guy you ’ve been texting every night before you go to bed . ”
74853	74872	74850	74850	I	199	“ Is it wrong to go with the flow and not put us into a box so soon ? ”
74878	74909	74873	74873	She	420	“ Of course not . I only want you to be careful and I do n’t want you to invest your heart in someone who does n’t plan on reciprocating . ”
74910	74921	74873	74873	She	420	“ We ’re going to keep it casual for now . ”
75254	75263	75243	75243	I	199	“ You have n’t been answering my texts . ”
75264	75270	75271	75271	I	199	“ Hello to you too . ”
75279	75288	75289	75289	His	256	“ You have n’t responded to my messages . ”
75314	75320	75321	75321	I	199	“ Did you miss me ? ”
75326	75329	75330	75330	He	256	“ No . ”
75338	75351	75335	75335	I	199	“ It ’s okay to admit your feelings . I ’ll wait . ”
75360	75373	75335	75335	I	199	“ Just like you made me wait all day for a confirmation ? ”
75376	75380	75335	75335	I	199	“ A confirmation ? ”
75381	75395	75442	75442	He	256	“ Yes . I ’m taking you out tomorrow night for a date . ”
75402	75413	75396	75396	I	199	“ Do n’t you think you should ask me first ? ”
75414	75426	75335	75335	I	199	“ I do n’t ask questions I know the answers to . ”
75427	75441	75396	75396	I	199	“ We need to work on your manners . They ’re severely lacking . ”
75456	75467	75442	75442	He	256	“ You were n’t complaining about politeness the other night . ”
75468	75488	75489	75489	I	199	“ Of course not . Every woman wants a gentleman in the streets and a beast in the sheets , ”
75512	75537	75506	75506	he	256	“ Pardon my mistake then . Will you do me the honor of gracing me with your presence tomorrow evening for dinner and cocktails ? ”
75538	75544	75545	75545	I	199	“ Emphasis on the cock ? ”
75593	75621	75550	75550	Rowan	256	“ I ca n’t go out with you tomorrow . We ’re having a late team meeting to discuss a few loose ends on previous proposals tomorrow . ”
75622	75633	75578	75578	his	256	“ Good thing you have an in with your boss . ”
75634	75645	75550	75550	Rowan	256	“ No way ! That ’s an abuse of power . ”
75646	75663	75578	75578	his	256	“ What ’s the point of having all this power if I do n’t use it ? ”
75669	75682	75664	75664	I	199	“ I ’m going to pretend you did not just say that . ”
75683	75696	75550	75550	Rowan	256	“ Pretend all you want . It does n’t change the outcome . ”
75697	75700	75664	75664	I	199	“ But — ”
75706	75715	75701	75701	He	256	“ Either you message Jenny or I will . ”
75721	75729	75716	75716	I	199	“ Your bossiness is losing its charm . ”
75742	75762	75730	75730	He	256	“ We ’ll have to test the theory out in a few circumstances then . Just to be sure . ”
75763	75774	75730	75730	He	256	“ You ’re always so thorough with everything you do . ”
75778	75786	75787	75787	He	256	“ I ’ll see you tomorrow night . ”
75800	75809	75787	75787	He	256	“ And answer my messages from now on . ”
75810	75820	75821	75821	I	199	“ I can once I get a replacement phone . ”
75830	75838	75821	75821	I	199	“ Do I even want to know ? ”
75842	75846	75839	75839	I	199	“ Probably not . ”
75910	75918	75919	75919	He	256	“ You look like … a princess . ”
76098	76101	76081	76081	he	256	“ Garfield . ”
76110	76115	76116	76116	He	256	“ God , no . ”
76270	76273	76274	76274	His	256	“ Gary . ”
76281	76284	76274	76274	His	256	“ No . ”
76285	76288	76274	76274	His	256	“ Gertrude . ”
76289	76297	76274	76274	His	256	“ That ’s a woman ’s name . ”
76301	76309	76298	76298	I	199	“ Your mom could have been progressive . ”
76369	76388	76357	76357	He	256	“ My mother was many great things , but even she was n’t that progressive . Thank God . ”
76389	76398	76435	76435	He	256	“ Hmm . Okay ! What about Glen ? ”
76399	76414	76357	76357	He	256	“ You ’ll never guess , so you might as well give up now . ”
76428	76434	76415	76415	I	199	“ I ’m no quitter . ”
76452	76479	76435	76435	He	256	“ That ’s why I ’ll reward you with the story of how I got my middle name . But I must swear you to secrecy . ”
76504	76511	76488	76488	He	256	“ A kiss for a secret . ”
76512	76521	76522	76522	I	199	“ I ’ve never heard of this game . ”
76525	76534	76488	76488	He	256	“ That ’s because it ’s exclusively ours . ”
76550	76557	76538	76538	my	199	“ I like this game already . ”
76648	76662	76641	76641	I	199	“ I can stop guessing . You do n’t need to tell me . ”
76668	76674	76663	76663	He	256	“ We made a deal . ”
76690	76700	76663	76663	He	256	“ I do n’t talk much about my mother . ”
76736	76766	76728	76728	he	256	“ Some of my memories are confusing since I was so young , but the one thing I remember most about my mom was that she loved King Arthur . ”
76767	76777	76778	76778	He	256	“ No way ! She was a history buff ? ”
76864	76888	76854	76854	He	256	“ My mother was obsessed with history and stories that bordered on fantasy . That ’s actually how she and my father met . ”
76903	76910	76911	76911	I	199	“ Tell me more . Please ? ”
76916	76961	76889	76889	He	256	“ She worked at the tutoring center at the university they both attended . My father walked into the building to pick up his friend whose car was at the shop . My mother was working the counter and asked if he needed help . ”
76962	76965	76911	76911	I	199	“ And ? ”
76966	76994	76889	76889	He	256	“ My father was a straight - A student who attended an entire semester ’s worth of tutoring sessions for a class he was n’t even taking . ”
76995	76998	76999	76999	I	199	“ No ! ”
77025	77045	76889	76889	He	256	“ It ’s true . Mom even revised his fake essays and homework about King Arthur and his knights . ”
77046	77057	77083	77083	He	256	“ I see lying is a Kane family trait here . ”
77061	77071	77058	77058	He	256	“ We do anything to get what we want . ”
77072	77079	77080	77080	I	199	“ Ruthless . All of you , ”
77090	77117	77118	77118	I	199	“ What did your dad say about it all ? And how did he get her to agree to a date after pretending for so long ? ”
77133	77139	77140	77140	Rowan	139	“ I do n’t remember . ”
77246	77260	77239	77239	I	199	“ So what ’s the connection between that story and your middle name ? ”
77261	77279	77239	77239	I	199	“ My mother named my brothers and me after King Arthur ’s Knights of the Round Table . ”
77280	77299	77239	77239	I	199	“ Those are some big shoes to fill . Did n’t they find the holy grail or something ? ”
77300	77304	77239	77239	I	199	“ Or something . ”
77323	77349	77239	77239	I	199	“ I have it easy . Declan ’s the one who has to introduce himself as Declan Lancelot Kane for the rest of his life . ”
77381	77389	77377	77377	Lancelot	572	“ And you ? Mr. R.G. Kane ? ”
77390	77393	77394	77394	he	1414	“ Galahad , ”
77413	77420	77377	77377	Lancelot	572	“ Aw . That ’s cute . ”
77421	77437	77394	77394	he	1414	“ There ’s only room for one liar here , and it ’s not you . ”
77443	77459	77438	77438	I	199	“ I mean it ! The story behind it makes it that much more special . ”
77464	77475	77438	77438	I	199	“ If you tell anyone , I ’ll have to — ”
77476	77489	77377	77377	Lancelot	572	“ Yeah , yeah . Fire me . I got it already . ”
77490	77519	77438	77438	I	199	“ I ’ll have to fuck you . But if you ’re interested in role - playing the other scenario , I ’m more than happy to oblige . ”
77520	77534	77535	77535	I	199	“ Did you make a sex joke ? ! I am absolutely scandalized . ”
77584	77590	77578	77578	I	199	“ You have a deal . ”
77593	77603	77604	77604	Zahra	256	“ It ’s not too late to go home . ”
77735	77741	77727	77727	I	199	“ Is it too fancy ? ”
77742	77757	77758	77758	She	139	“ No — I mean yes ! I mean , look at this menu . ”
77775	77794	77758	77758	She	139	“ Any place without prices and lots of French words is a red flag for my bank account . ”
77795	77801	77802	77802	I	199	“ You ’re not paying , ”
77809	77828	77758	77758	She	139	“ Yeah , well , it would be presumptuous for me to assume we would n’t go halfsies . ”
77829	77832	77833	77833	I	199	“ Halfsies . ”
77836	77843	77833	77833	I	199	“ What has gotten into you ? ”
77844	77847	77848	77848	She	139	“ Nothing . ”
77870	77881	77833	77833	I	199	“ Are you always this nervous on a first date ? ”
77885	77891	77882	77882	She	139	“ I ’m not nervous . ”
77892	77908	77882	77882	She	139	“ You drank a two - hundred - dollar glass of wine in ten minutes . ”
77914	77922	77923	77923	she	139	“ Two . Hundred . Dollars ? ! ”
77928	77942	77923	77923	she	139	“ Why would you spend that much on a bunch of old grapes ? ”
77980	77987	77961	77961	Her	139	“ Do you know those people ? ”
77994	77997	77988	77988	She	139	“ Who ? ”
78017	78020	78007	78007	she	139	“ Yes . ”
78021	78026	78007	78007	she	139	“ Who are they ? ”
78027	78041	78007	78007	she	139	“ The blond guy with tiny hands and a massive forehead is Lance . ”
78156	78163	78153	78153	I	199	“ Do you want him back ? ”
78172	78176	78177	78177	Her	139	“ What ? ! ”
78186	78191	78177	78177	Her	139	“ God , no . ”
78192	78198	78177	78177	Her	139	“ Then forget about him . ”
78199	78221	78222	78222	Her	139	“ Easier said than done . He ’s right there with her . I hate seeing them because it reminds me — ”
78299	78306	78314	78314	She	139	“ Let ’s play a game . ”
78328	78336	78314	78314	She	139	“ You ’re all about games tonight . ”
78337	78363	78314	78314	She	139	“ Would you rather go skinny - dipping in the middle of the ocean or run naked through Dreamland in the middle of the night ? ”
78364	78380	78314	78314	She	139	“ I hate running but I hate sharks more so definitely running naked through Dreamland . ”
78384	78393	78381	78381	I	199	“ Naughty girl . You could get caught . ”
78394	78402	78403	78403	she	139	“ Good thing I know the boss , ”
78469	78473	78474	78474	I	199	“ Your turn . ”
78511	78530	78486	78486	Her	139	“ Would you rather never read a book again or never be able to check the stock market ? ”
78531	78538	78539	78539	I	199	“ Hitting me where it hurts . ”
78551	78566	78548	78548	She	139	“ The fact that you have to think this one over breaks my heart . ”
78574	78586	78567	78567	I	199	“ I ’d have to give up reading books . Sorry . ”
78587	78597	78598	78598	She	139	“ Well , this was fun while it lasted . ”
78611	78627	78567	78567	I	199	“ You said I never could read a book again . Audiobooks do n’t count . ”
78633	78646	78628	78628	Her	139	“ You — that ’s . You ca n’t cheat like that ! ”
78647	78654	78703	78703	She	139	“ Life ’s all about semantics . ”
78655	78661	78628	78628	Her	139	“ Dating a businessman sucks . ”
78672	78702	78662	78662	I	199	“ I gather it ’s a bit of a change from the wonderful company you picked up on the dating apps . What about the electrician with the mother ? ”
78710	78724	78703	78703	She	139	“ I ’ll have you know that Chip was a very nice man . ”
78725	78735	78703	78703	She	139	“ Who brought his mother along on the date . ”
78736	78743	78703	78703	She	139	“ I thought it was sweet . ”
78744	78755	78756	78756	I	199	“ She asked you if you had a fertility tracker . ”
78994	78998	78984	78984	Zahra	256	“ Your turn . ”
79272	79282	79265	79265	I	199	“ Lance Baker . I ’ve heard about you . ”
79290	79310	79283	79283	He	572	“ Mr. Kane . I wanted to stop by and say hello . Zahra and I go way back . ”
79342	79352	79322	79322	Lance	86	“ She told me about your Nebula Land submission . ”
79365	79377	79353	79353	He	572	“ Oh yes . I was shocked my proposal was accepted . ”
79465	79477	79478	79478	Zahra	256	“ Oh , Lance . Hi . Weird seeing you here . ”
79484	79491	79478	79478	Zahra	256	“ I ’m celebrating my anniversary . ”
79513	79529	79507	79507	Zahra	256	“ Is n’t it considered bad taste to celebrate the time you started an affair ? ”
79677	79704	79670	79670	Lance	86	“ Mr. Kane . I ’m sorry to interrupt . I did n’t realize you and Zahra were in the middle of a business meeting tonight . ”
79705	79710	79711	79711	I	199	“ We ’re not , ”
79749	79762	79778	79778	His	86	“ Well , I ’m sorry to intrude on this … outing . ”
79763	79769	79770	79770	I	199	“ Why did you then ? ”
79819	79830	79831	79831	She	1421	“ Mr. Kane . Can I help you with something ? ”
79839	79858	79831	79831	She	1421	“ I ’d like to send this man ’s table a bottle of Dom Perignon on my tab . ”
79862	79872	79859	79859	She	1421	“ Of course . What occasion are we celebrating ? ”
79873	79878	79879	79880	The hostess	1421	“ His job promotion . ”
79928	79932	79933	79933	he	86	“ Job promotion ? ”
79936	79954	79933	79933	he	86	“ It ’s come to my attention that you have been a dedicated Dreamland employee for years . ”
80014	80033	80007	80007	I	199	“ You ’re officially being transferred to Dreamland Shanghai to work with the Creators there . Effective immediately . ”
80042	80047	80039	80039	his	86	“ Shanghai ? China ? ”
80048	80061	80007	80007	I	199	“ It appears you have two reasons to celebrate tonight . Congratulations . ”
80154	80162	80163	80163	Her	1452	“ You ’re so getting laid tonight . ”
80242	80258	80259	80259	She	1452	“ Congratulations on Shanghai . You should be so proud of your accomplishments , Lance . ”
80351	80382	80383	80383	I	199	“ There ’s a reason men like you hurt women like Zahra . It has nothing to do with her and everything to do with what you ’re severely lacking . ”
80492	80501	80480	80480	Her	1457	“ Are you really sending him to Shanghai ? ”
80502	80509	80510	80510	I	199	“ That ’s up to him . ”
80518	80522	80480	80480	Her	1457	“ How so ? ”
80523	80553	80480	80480	Her	1457	“ He can either go to Shanghai or hand in his resignation . It does n’t matter to me as long as he gets the hell off my property . ”
80559	80566	80554	80554	She	1457	“ Why would you do that ? ”
80570	80577	80578	80578	She	1457	“ You really do like me . ”
80584	80592	80593	80593	I	199	“ I already told you this earlier . ”
80624	80631	80612	80612	She	1457	“ Actions speak louder than words . ”
80632	80640	80641	80641	I	199	“ And what do my actions say ? ”
80667	80678	80641	80641	I	199	“ That you care more than you ’re letting on . ”
80689	80701	80679	80679	I	199	“ Do n’t go wishing for things that ca n’t happen . ”
80720	80736	80705	80705	her	1457	“ That ’s okay . I ’ll dream big enough for the two of us . ”
81003	81009	81010	81010	he	172	“ This is n’t safe , ”
81031	81036	81010	81010	he	172	“ There you go . ”
81044	81052	81037	81037	He	172	“ I was n’t complaining about me . ”
81053	81059	81060	81060	I	199	“ You ’re overthinking things . ”
81408	81417	81397	81397	He	256	“ This is highly inappropriate for a car . ”
81418	81429	81397	81397	He	256	“ We have n’t even gotten to the best part . ”
81437	81448	81397	81397	He	256	“ Are you going to show me or tell me ? ”
81449	81455	81456	81456	I	199	“ Show . Always show . ”
81481	81499	81500	81500	He	256	“ You ’re so stunning that it hurts to stare at you for long periods of time . ”
81807	81819	81820	81820	He	256	“ Your pretty little cunt has n’t earned my cock yet . ”
81892	81899	81900	81900	His	256	“ I was right all along . ”
81912	81942	81943	81943	His	256	“ You , Zahra Gulian , really are nothing but a fraud . A temptress who hides behind sweet smiles and kind words while hiding this monster within you . ”
81986	81992	81993	81993	His	256	“ But I see you . ”
82086	82092	82061	82061	He	256	“ And I want you . ”
82137	82143	82144	82144	he	256	“ You drive me crazy , ”
82164	82167	82168	82168	I	199	“ Wild . ”
82171	82176	82168	82168	I	199	“ Out of control . ”
82184	82217	82168	82168	I	199	“ Reckless enough to fuck you in the back seat with my driver only three feet away , separated by a plastic divider that is n’t made to block out your cries . ”
82246	82266	82267	82267	He	256	“ I think you like the idea of other people hearing me fuck you until your voice is hoarse . ”
82291	82301	82272	82272	I	199	“ Maybe I like them hearing me fuck you . ”
82484	82493	82494	82494	He	256	“ Show me how badly you want it . ”
82594	82624	82625	82625	I	199	“ I might be a fraud , but you ’re nothing but a beautiful liar . A man willing to do anything to get what he wants . Selfish . ”
82641	82644	82645	82645	I	199	“ Controlling . ”
82659	82680	82681	82681	My	199	“ An angry man with secret smiles and soft laughs and a golden heart he keeps hidden from the world . ”
82733	82759	82760	82760	I	199	“ I think you hate how much you want me . Because to care about me means you have to admit to having a heart . ”
82769	82786	82760	82760	I	199	“ So keep telling yourself those pretty little lies . Your secret is safe with me . ”
83068	83087	83053	83053	Rowan	256	“ If I had a heart to give , it would be all yours . Free of cost . ”
83162	83176	83177	83177	I	199	“ Can you go back to not smiling ? This is n’t fair . ”
83188	83197	83184	83184	His	256	“ But I like the way you squirm . ”
83206	83209	83198	83198	I	199	“ Asshole . ”
83224	83243	83210	83210	He	256	“ If you ’re trying to turn me off , you ’re going about it the wrong way . ”
83260	83267	83268	83268	I	199	“ What are you doing here ? ”
83271	83286	83244	83244	I	199	“ I wanted to let you know we ’re going on a date tomorrow . ”
83287	83290	83291	83291	I	199	“ Okay … ”
83330	83339	83340	83340	he	256	“ After we have dinner with your family , ”
83345	83350	83340	83340	he	256	“ Come again ? ! ”
83351	83355	83356	83356	He	256	“ Maybe later . ”
83377	83382	83359	83359	I	199	“ Do n’t wink . ”
83383	83386	83401	83401	He	256	“ Why ? ”
83387	83400	83359	83359	I	199	“ Because my ovaries might implode and that would be quite unfortunate . ”
83406	83415	83401	83401	He	256	“ Ani invited me after our last meeting . ”
83416	83421	83422	83422	I	199	“ That little conniving — ”
83434	83445	83446	83446	Ugh	134	“ It ’s cute how much she talks you up . ”
83461	83473	83458	83458	I	199	“ I ’m not sure you ’re ready for my family . ”
83474	83497	83446	83446	Ugh	134	“ Please . I need to hear all about your parents getting married in Vegas . Their love for Elvis runs deep . ”
83498	83517	83458	83458	I	199	“ Do n’t encourage them . They ’ll whip out an old album and shower you with stories . ”
83518	83548	83446	83446	Ugh	134	“ Ani mentioned they have a video of you performing with your ukulele in the living room . You can consider me quite interested in viewing that family film . ”
83569	83577	83578	83579	my mom	420	“ Are n’t you the sweetest thing ? ”
83608	83611	83612	83613	My dad	737	“ Welcome . ”
83642	83646	83647	83647	Ani	2278	“ You came ! ”
83693	83702	83678	83679	My dad	737	“ I like him better than Lance already . ”
83703	83706	83707	83707	I	199	“ Dad ! ”
83721	83726	83727	83727	Mom	420	“ Let ’s eat ! ”
83766	83774	83775	83775	He	737	“ Have you tried Armenian food before ? ”
83780	83787	83775	83775	He	737	“ Are you a picky eater ? ”
83793	83801	83788	83788	He	737	“ I ’ll eat anything but caviar . ”
83807	83834	83788	83788	He	737	“ Great ! Then prepare to be amazed . My mom might be from Europe , but she learned all my dad ’s favorite Armenian recipes . ”
83865	83879	83880	83881	My dad	737	“ So , Mr. Kane , how are you liking Dreamland so far ? ”
83897	83904	83891	83891	He	737	“ It ’s growing on me . ”
83927	83934	83915	83915	He	737	“ And please call me Rowan . ”
83938	83965	83935	83935	Mom	420	“ Zahra told us all about the project you ’re working on . It ’s so nice that you want to celebrate the park ’s anniversary . ”
83974	83982	83966	83966	Rowan	256	“ It ’s what my grandfather wanted . ”
83983	83990	83991	83992	my dad	737	“ He was a great man , ”
83998	84008	83995	83995	Rowan	256	“ I ’m glad the people here appreciated him . ”
84033	84042	84043	84043	I	199	“ You do n’t have to be nervous , ”
84049	84057	84058	84058	he	737	“ I ’m bad at small talk , ”
84090	84100	84101	84101	Mom	420	“ How do you like Florida compared to Chicago ? ”
84104	84109	84082	84082	he	256	“ It’s … hot . ”
84125	84142	84143	84143	Dad	212	“ It must be a change compared to Chicago . We ’ve always wanted to visit . ”
84146	84157	84158	84158	Ani	2278	“ But we have n’t had a vacation in years , ”
84163	84167	84168	84168	Rowan	256	“ Why not ? ”
84178	84181	84182	84182	Her	514	“ Oh . ”
84227	84242	84243	84243	Claire	420	“ Because we ca n’t afford to take vacations even if we wanted to , ”
84250	84253	84254	84254	Rowan	256	“ Right . ”
84421	84428	84429	84429	I	199	“ I ’m sorry about earlier , ”
84442	84449	84429	84429	I	199	“ Why would you be sorry ? ”
84450	84464	84433	84433	His	256	“ Because you were already nervous about talking and then that conversation happened . ”
84469	84482	84465	84465	His	256	“ It ’s not your fault I ’m an asshole , Zahra . ”
84486	84495	84483	84483	I	199	“ Do n’t talk about yourself that way . ”
84496	84504	84429	84429	I	199	“ I thought you valued the truth . ”
84510	84540	84541	84541	He	256	“ It ’s the reality of the situation . I make business decisions that affect people ’s lives for better or for worse . It is what it is . ”
84551	84570	84571	84571	He	256	“ But you could change . No one is forcing you to choose one side over the other . ”
84578	84585	84571	84571	He	256	“ Running a business is hard . ”
84586	84592	84593	84593	He	256	“ So is being human . ”
84607	84619	84593	84593	He	256	“ I do n’t know the first thing about being human . ”
84620	84633	84634	84634	I	199	“ That ’s okay . I ’ll teach you everything I know . ”
84644	84654	84655	84655	he	256	“ That ’s exactly what I ’m afraid of , ”
84676	84681	84682	84682	Ani	2278	“ He ’s here ! ”
84703	84706	84692	84692	she	2278	“ Who ? ”
84707	84710	84692	84692	she	2278	“ Rowan ! ”
84726	84738	84711	84711	My	199	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . You know this how ? ”
84739	84749	84750	84750	Ani	2278	“ He wanted to surprise you for your date . ”
84800	84808	84809	84809	I	199	“ What do you mean by date ? ”
84813	84827	84828	84828	Ani	2278	“ The kind where Rowan whisks you away to show you his surprise . ”
84850	84859	84860	84860	Ani	2278	“ Hurry up . You ’re so slow . ”
84873	84879	84860	84860	Ani	2278	“ Am I moving somewhere ? ”
84883	84899	84880	84880	She	2278	“ No , silly . Rowan asked me to pack you a couple of outfits . ”
84900	84906	84907	84907	She	2278	“ Outfits ? For what ? ”
84910	84921	84907	84907	She	2278	“ I ’m under contract to not say anything else . ”
84922	84936	84880	84880	She	2278	“ How did you even get into my apartment and pack a suitcase ? ”
84937	84940	84941	84941	Her	2278	“ Claire . ”
84946	84954	84955	84955	I	199	“ How far does this surprise go ? ”
84978	84984	84975	84975	Ani	2278	“ It ’s worth it . ”
85016	85030	85031	85031	Ani	2278	“ Do n’t worry about anything . I even packed your sexy clothes . ”
85038	85054	85034	85034	My	199	“ Oh my God . You did n’t ! How did you even find them ? ”
85055	85066	85067	85067	Ani	2278	“ A sister never reveals her secrets . Have fun ! ”
85077	85088	85034	85034	My	199	“ Claire will be home soon to make you dinner . ”
85089	85099	85067	85067	Ani	2278	“ Bye , Mom ! Stop worrying about me ! ”
85120	85126	85100	85100	I	199	“ Fancy seeing you here . ”
85127	85130	85131	85131	He	256	“ Hello . ”
85195	85209	85185	85185	His	256	“ We better get going . We ’ve got a flight to catch . ”
85210	85213	85185	85185	His	256	“ Flight ? ”
85258	85263	85264	85264	He	256	“ Here we are . ”
85273	85282	85283	85283	I	199	“ Are we stopping somewhere before our flight ? ”
85351	85357	85332	85332	I	199	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
85358	85364	85422	85422	He	1459	“ I do n’t joke . ”
85365	85368	85332	85332	I	199	“ Liar . ”
85383	85400	85377	85377	I	199	“ When you said we had a flight to catch , I thought you meant commercial . ”
85401	85406	85422	85422	He	1459	“ God , no . ”
85407	85421	85377	85377	I	199	“ Oh yes . Because mini pretzels and babies crying is so aversive . ”
85432	85439	85422	85422	He	1459	“ Good . You get it . ”
85468	85478	85461	85461	he	1459	“ We ’re seriously going on a private plane ? ”
85479	85482	85483	85483	I	199	“ Yes . ”
85521	85533	85509	85509	Rowan	256	“ Scared you might get addicted to this kind of lifestyle ? ”
85534	85544	85545	85545	I	199	“ That ’s the last thought on my mind . ”
85612	85617	85608	85608	he	1459	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
85626	85651	85618	85618	I	199	“ You look like you stepped out of a Tom Ford catalog while I resemble someone who sifted through the BOGO bin at Goodwill . ”
85661	85681	85652	85652	I	199	“ This is n’t even a Michael Jordan sweatshirt because that was n’t an option at the thrift store . ”
85689	85695	85696	85696	His	1459	“ I like your style . ”
85719	85735	85762	85762	I	199	“ I like my style too , but it ’s not exactly private jet material . ”
85736	85740	85773	85773	he	1459	“ Says who ? ”
85741	85744	85762	85762	I	199	“ Me ! ”
85745	85761	85773	85773	he	1459	“ How would you know if you ’ve never been on a private jet before ? ”
85780	85788	85773	85773	he	1459	“ You can be so infuriating sometimes ! ”
85804	85818	85819	85819	He	1459	“ We should get going because we do n’t want to be late . ”
85914	85921	85922	85922	He	1459	“ Graceful as ever , Zahra . ”
85969	85976	85960	85960	He	1459	“ What ’s that face for ? ”
85977	85980	86018	86018	He	1459	“ Nothing . ”
85981	85986	85960	85960	He	1459	“ You ’re uncomfortable . ”
86010	86017	85991	85991	I	199	“ No . I ’m fine . ”
86027	86053	86018	86018	He	1459	“ I think you might be the only person I ’ve met who is intimidated by my money and wants nothing to do with it . ”
86054	86072	86073	86073	My	199	“ Must be quite the contrast compared to the majority who are mainly intimidated by your personality . ”
86102	86112	86092	86092	His	1459	“ I like the way you make me feel . ”
86113	86118	86149	86149	He	1459	“ And that is ? ”
86119	86127	86092	86092	His	1459	“ Like I ’m a real person . ”
86133	86148	86128	86128	I	199	“ If these are your standards , there ’s nowhere to go but up . ”
86249	86265	86339	86339	He	1459	“ I ’ve never seen someone look this excited to be in New York before . ”
86266	86279	86245	86245	he	1459	“ Are you kidding me ? This is a dream come true ! ”
86280	86305	86339	86339	He	1459	“ Hold off on that statement until you get off the plane . I ’m pretty sure the smell alone will convince you otherwise . ”
86306	86315	86245	86245	he	1459	“ What kind of person hates New York ? ”
86316	86324	86339	86339	He	1459	“ The same kind who loves Chicago . ”
86325	86330	86331	86331	I	199	“ Take that back ! ”
86342	86360	86339	86339	He	1459	“ Nope . Not until you come with me to Chicago and confirm what I already know . ”
86391	86405	86434	86434	I	199	“ People ca n’t take off and fly away whenever the feeling strikes . ”
86410	86414	86406	86406	His	1459	“ Why not ? ”
86415	86423	86434	86434	I	199	“ Because we have jobs and responsibilities . ”
86424	86433	86406	86406	His	1459	“ Leave dealing with your boss to me . ”
86487	86493	86494	86494	I	199	“ Snow ! Real snow ! ”
86516	86521	86511	86511	Rowan	256	“ We got lucky . ”
86522	86527	86511	86511	Rowan	256	“ Lucky ? How ? ”
86536	86557	86528	86528	His	1459	“ There usually is n’t snow this early in the season but they just had a storm the other day . ”
86558	86572	86573	86573	I	199	“ If that ’s not fate , I do n’t know what is . ”
86737	86742	86743	86743	I	199	“ You live here ? ”
86766	86776	86763	86763	He	256	“ Sometimes . It ’s one of my homes . ”
86777	86781	86782	86782	He	256	“ One ? ! ”
86785	86797	86782	86782	He	256	“ What ’s it like to have more money than God ? ”
86798	86801	86802	86802	His	256	“ Lonely . ”
86882	86902	86927	86928	the man	256	“ Okay . I ’m going to act cool from now on and pretend none of this phases me . ”
86903	86921	86956	86956	He	256	“ Do n’t do that . I … It ’s fun to see things from your perspective . ”
87157	87166	87151	87151	he	256	“ This is one hell of a date . ”
87167	87183	87151	87151	he	256	“ Please . We have n’t even gotten to that portion of the evening yet . ”
87184	87211	87151	87151	he	256	“ Just want to let you know you ’re setting an unattainable bar for future men . I ’ll never accept movie theater dates after this . ”
87224	87241	87242	87242	He	256	“ That ’s because you ’re more of a drive - in type of girl anyway . ”
87353	87365	87366	87366	I	199	“ I hope you know I might never leave this place . ”
87414	87424	87454	87454	He	256	“ You would give up Dreamland for the city ? ”
87432	87453	87425	87425	I	199	“ No . I love Dreamland . I could spend the rest of my life there and never get bored . ”
87467	87472	87454	87454	He	256	“ Really ? Why ? ”
87473	87493	87454	87454	He	256	“ My whole family lives there . I ’d be crazy to give that up for some random city . ”
87494	87497	87498	87498	His	256	“ Hmm . ”
87510	87521	87522	87522	I	199	“ Are you happy giving up the city for Dreamland ? ”
87532	87552	87584	87584	His	256	“ I never thought I could feel happy at Dreamland again , but now I ’m not too sure . ”
87556	87559	87553	87553	I	199	“ Really ? ”
87560	87574	87575	87575	His	256	“ I might have met the one person who makes the place bearable . ”
87650	87659	87634	87634	I	199	“ Well , this explains the massive suitcase . ”
87735	87749	87750	87750	I	199	“ Why is my bag filled with all my De La Rosa books ? ”
87759	87783	87784	87784	He	419	“ Because the famous bodice ripper is signing books in New York tonight , and we happen to have tickets to her event . ”
87814	87818	87806	87806	I	199	“ No way ! ”
87848	87853	87854	87854	He	419	“ You like it . ”
87886	87906	87871	87871	I	199	“ Like it ? I love it ! How did you get tickets like this at the last minute ? ”
87912	87917	87907	87907	He	419	“ I have connections . ”
87918	87929	87907	87907	He	419	“ Okay , now I ’m impressed by your wealth . ”
88236	88240	88241	88241	He	256	“ Your turn . ”
88257	88266	88267	88267	I	199	“ Hi ! I ’m a huge fan . ”
88355	88366	88367	88367	Juliana	118	“ My , my . Are n’t you a looker ! ”
88434	88451	88424	88424	Juliana	118	“ Rowan , you did n’t tell me your girlfriend is as cute as a button . ”
88477	88484	88472	88472	He	256	“ Zahra is n’t my girlfriend . ”
88503	88518	88496	88496	Her	118	“ Well , my dear , you need to lock this man down immediately . ”
88529	88538	88525	88525	she	118	“ I had no idea you knew Rowan ! ”
88558	88561	88543	88543	Rowan	256	“ Hey ! ”
88595	88612	88585	88585	Juliana	118	“ He scheduled this entire event for you because he said you ’re my biggest fan . ”
88619	88625	88613	88613	I	199	“ Are you serious ? ! ”
88634	88637	88626	88626	I	199	“ How ? ”
88638	88647	88648	88648	Juliana	118	“ Ah , you did n’t tell her , ”
88652	88659	88660	88660	I	199	“ You planned this whole thing ? ”
88674	88681	88660	88660	I	199	“ No . I had help . ”
88685	88713	88682	88682	Juliana	118	“ Dear , without him , my ass would be glued to a lawn chair somewhere in Hawaii right now celebrating the release of my new book . ”
88714	88723	88682	88682	Juliana	118	“ But you ’re here ? For me ? ”
88724	88738	88739	88739	She	118	“ It pays to have friends in high places , does n’t it ? ”
88742	88754	88739	88739	She	118	“ His company made my books into the show you love . ”
88755	88760	88761	88761	I	199	“ His company ? ! ”
88808	88821	88800	88800	I	199	“ Scott never needed my password to watch TV . Did he ? ”
88829	88832	88822	88822	He	256	“ No . ”
88833	88839	88822	88822	He	256	“ Then why use it ? ”
88840	88853	88854	88854	Juliana	118	“ Why else , dearie . Love makes us do silly things , ”
88857	88865	88822	88822	He	256	“ Oh no . We ’re just … ”
88866	88871	88872	88872	he	256	“ Seizing the day , ”
88880	88889	88877	88877	I	199	“ Right ! One day at a time . ”
88913	88925	88906	88906	Juliana	118	“ You let me know who stops believing the lie first . ”
88999	89015	88991	88991	Rowan	256	“ Why did you use my account then if you literally created the entire platform ? ”
89016	89027	88991	88991	Rowan	256	“ I wanted to see what you were interested in . ”
89083	89103	89104	89104	Juliana	118	“ Well , come on now . I have about a hundred more people to see after you two . ”
89193	89198	89180	89180	We	1569	“ It ’s snowing ! ”
89199	89214	89215	89215	He	360	“ We should be getting another few inches tonight . Talk about freaky weather . ”
89248	89258	89218	89218	I	199	“ Slow down there before you kiss the sidewalk . ”
89390	89393	89394	89394	I	199	“ Ouch . ”
89408	89413	89394	89394	I	199	“ Are you okay ? ”
89414	89425	89394	89394	I	199	“ Ask me tomorrow when my lungs start working again . ”
89660	89668	89669	89669	She	118	“ So , what ’s the plan ? ”
89737	89757	89727	89727	She	118	“ You ’re going to burn a hole through my clothes if you keep staring at me like that . ”
89758	89767	89768	89768	I	199	“ Remove your clothes then . Problem solved . ”
89820	89824	89813	89813	She	118	“ How embarrassing . ”
89859	89864	89846	89846	I	199	“ Take your pick . ”
89880	89886	89887	89887	She	118	“ When in New York ? ”
89892	89905	89865	89865	She	118	“ You pick that when you could have Ruth ’s Chris takeout ? ”
89906	89912	89865	89865	She	118	“ Who ’s Ruth Chris ? ”
89916	89921	89913	89913	I	199	“ Pizza it is . ”
89999	90017	90018	90018	She	197	“ So you said this was one of your properties . How many do you have exactly ? ”
90033	90038	90027	90027	I	199	“ Twenty - eight . ”
90039	90044	90018	90018	She	197	“ Are you serious ? ”
90045	90048	90027	90027	I	199	“ Yes . ”
90057	90068	90049	90049	Her	197	“ Okay . Wow . Which one is your favorite ? ”
90086	90095	90069	90069	I	199	“ Honestly , I do n’t have one . ”
90101	90109	90096	90096	Her	197	“ None of them feel like home ? ”
90110	90120	90121	90121	She	197	“ Home is wherever I ’m needed for work . ”
90126	90155	90121	90121	She	197	“ There ’s some climates I prefer more than others . Like Chicago is great in the summer but my dick is subject to frostbite during the winter . ”
90156	90160	90121	90121	She	197	“ And Dreamland ? ”
90168	90173	90161	90161	I	199	“ Dreamland is different . ”
90174	90178	90121	90121	She	197	“ How so ? ”
90179	90191	90161	90161	I	199	“ There were a lot of bad memories there for me . ”
90197	90211	90192	90192	Her	197	“ Oh . It ’s surprising you wanted to become the Director then . ”
90212	90240	90284	90284	She	197	“ I was interested in taking the park to the next level . It was in my best interest to move past the issues holding me back . ”
90287	90297	90284	90284	She	197	“ Do you feel better about being there now ? ”
90298	90309	90284	90284	She	197	“ I met someone who makes my time there tolerable . ”
90328	90339	90284	90284	She	197	“ Tolerable ? I ’ve got to step it up . ”
90352	90364	90347	90347	I	199	“ Enough questions about me . I ’m curious about something . ”
90365	90368	90340	90340	She	197	“ What ? ”
90369	90376	90347	90347	I	199	“ Tell me about your pins . ”
90387	90395	90396	90396	She	197	“ It ’s not a cute story . ”
90405	90413	90414	90414	I	199	“ I did n’t ask for one . ”
90445	90463	90439	90439	she	197	“ The first day I attended therapy was the same day I got my very first pin . ”
90498	90506	90470	90470	Zahra	256	“ You went to therapy ? Why ? ”
90507	90524	90540	90540	Her	197	“ Because I realized that I could n’t fix myself without putting in the hard work . ”
90525	90530	90531	90531	I	199	“ But you ’re — ”
90545	90556	90540	90540	Her	197	“ What ? I ’m nice ? Happy ? Smiling ? ”
90557	90562	90540	90540	Her	197	“ Well , yes . ”
90587	90601	90602	90602	She	197	“ Everyone has bad times . And for me , I — there — ”
90617	90630	90631	90631	She	197	“ About two years ago , I fell into a deep depression . ”
90641	90644	90638	90638	I	199	“ What ? ”
90649	90700	90645	90645	Her	197	“ It ’s true . I did n’t know it at the time , but Claire was the one who officially told me I needed to get help . She even helped me search for a therapist and told me to try to talk to someone about how I felt . ”
90701	90712	90638	90638	I	199	“ I — I do n’t know what to say . ”
90716	90729	90730	90730	She	197	“ I do n’t even know why I ’m crying right now . ”
90745	90824	90825	90825	Her	197	“ I know I ’m in a better place . But … God . When Lance broke my heart , I could hardly get out of bed . I used up all my vacation days for the year because I was n’t sleeping much and it felt like a chore to even get up . It was like I was going through the motions of life but not really living . Barely even eating . And the thoughts — ”
90842	90878	90825	90825	Her	197	“ I hated myself so much . For months , I blamed myself . Because what kind of stupid woman would n’t realize a man was cheating on her ? I felt pathetic and used . ”
90879	90894	90895	90895	My	199	“ You ’re many amazing things , and pathetic is n’t one of them . ”
90913	90995	90909	90909	She	197	“ I know that now . But at the time , I felt so weak because nothing I did could stop this feeling of hopelessness that took over . I tried . God , I really did because I never knew what it was like to be anything but happy . But the harder I tried to put on a face , the worse things got . I eventually hit a scary point where I wondered if life was worth it . ”
91004	91035	90996	90996	She	197	“ I — I never thought I would be the kind of person who thought I might be better off gone . I ’m ashamed I ever even considered it . ”
91075	91108	91112	91112	her	197	“ This is me now . But who I was before , when everything happened — I was a broken shell . I forgot to believe in myself when it mattered most . ”
91253	91310	91245	91245	I	199	“ Claire was the one who started my pin collection after my very first therapy session . She bought me an Iggy the Alien one she found on Etsy , but instead of him holding up his three fingers in peace , he was flipping everyone off . It was a symbolic fuck you to Lance . ”
91319	91326	91311	91311	I	199	“ That ’s illegal trademark infringement . ”
91327	91331	91332	91332	She	1598	“ Sue me . ”
91339	91355	91335	91335	I	199	“ How did you go from one pin to a whole backpack covered in them ? ”
91356	91404	91311	91311	I	199	“ Claire made it her mission to find me the most outrageous pins each week . Every time I came back from my weekly session , she would unveil it . Now she gets me two a year , one for my birthday and one for Christmas . ”
91405	91412	91335	91335	I	199	“ She ’s a good friend . ”
91413	91436	91311	91311	I	199	“ The best kind . I ’m lucky to have her in my life . As a roommate and a best friend . ”
91451	91458	91437	91437	I	199	“ But now you ’re better ? ”
91479	91482	91476	91476	She	1599	“ Definitely . ”
91483	91495	91497	91497	you	1600	“ For what it ’s worth , he never deserved you . ”
91500	91503	91504	91504	Her	1599	“ Thanks . ”
91516	91535	91476	91476	She	1599	“ If you do n’t mind me asking , why do you wear the pins then every day ? ”
91536	91558	91559	91559	Her	1599	“ As a reminder and a promise to myself that no matter how hard life gets , I ’ll keep pushing . ”
91591	91597	91577	91577	I	199	“ You ’re ridiculously amazing . ”
91598	91605	91577	91577	I	199	“ Because I wear awesome pins ? ”
91606	91612	91577	91577	I	199	“ Because you ’re you . ”
91674	91699	91667	91667	I	199	“ One day I hope I can be strong like you . To maybe talk some things out that have been weighing on me . ”
91707	91712	91700	91700	She	1599	“ Strong like me ? ”
91841	91854	91865	91865	her	420	“ I — I was very affected by my mother ’s death . ”
91895	91902	91891	91891	she	420	“ A kiss for a secret ? ”
92006	92010	91998	91998	She	420	“ My secret . ”
92085	92171	92079	92079	I	199	“ My dad was a latchkey kid who had access to anything money could buy . Private jets . Boats . A full - time wait staff . But none of it mattered once my mom came into his life . They are — were the closest thing to true love . At least that ’s what I was told because I was too young to remember much about them together . But Declan always said that whatever my mom wanted , my dad granted . ”
92176	92182	92172	92172	Zahra	420	“ That ’s so sad . ”
92185	92199	92172	92172	Zahra	420	“ Do n’t feel sorry for my dad . He ’s an asshole . ”
92200	92209	92172	92172	Zahra	420	“ I feel sorry for all of you . ”
92216	92231	92210	92210	I	199	“ My parents loved Dreamland as much as my grandfather … until everything changed . ”
92232	92239	92172	92172	Zahra	420	“ When your mom got sick ? ”
92243	92263	92240	92240	I	199	“ I ’m sorry . No child should lose their mother at such a young age like you did . ”
92321	92335	92336	92336	Zahra	420	“ One of the last memories I have with her was at Dreamland . ”
92347	92410	92336	92336	Zahra	420	“ My mom was everything to us . And the few good memories I have of my parents together include my dad waiting on her hand and foot . If my mom smiled at something , my dad found a way to own more of it . If she cried about something , my dad was hell - bent on demolishing it . ”
92418	92427	92411	92411	Zahra	420	“ He sounds like a man in love . ”
92428	92440	92411	92411	Zahra	420	“ Love . Such a simple word for something so devastating . ”
92441	92450	92451	92451	Her	420	“ Nothing that good can be given freely . ”
92491	92507	92508	92508	My	199	“ My dad was never the same after she passed , and neither were we . ”
92565	92644	92558	92558	I	199	“ My father treated us like shit because I think he was scared . Because taking care of us on his own meant accepting that my mother was truly gone , and he was n’t ready for that . He abandoned us when we needed him most and replaced himself with someone none of us recognized . And instead of losing one parent , we lost both . One to cancer , and the other to his vices . ”
92649	92722	92558	92558	I	199	“ We protected him because we thought he would get better . Looking back , we were too young to know any better . We should ’ve told someone about his issues . But he kept his alcoholism so well hidden . Our grandfather was suspicious , sure , but we protected our father . Not out of loyalty for him , but maybe for our mother ? I do n’t know . ”
92723	92728	92762	92762	Zahra	420	“ You were children . ”
92729	92755	92756	92756	I	199	“ But maybe if we had gotten him the help he needed early , we could ’ve stopped the years of pain we felt after . ”
92793	92802	92756	92756	I	199	“ Pain tests us all in different ways . ”
92806	92836	92803	92803	I	199	“ I think for him , he ruined what everyone else loved because he could n’t stand to lose the one person he cared for most in the world . ”
92837	92848	92895	92895	Zahra	420	“ And what do you think he ruined for you ? ”
92849	92894	92803	92803	I	199	“ The one thing I was good at . My brothers had sports , or comic books , or special clubs . But me ? I was the odd one out . The disappointing artistic one who talked too much and dreamed too big . ”
92916	92978	92913	92913	I	199	“ I got to the point that I started resenting myself . All I wanted to do was make my dad happy , but instead , I proved to him time and time again why I failed . Why I was the weakest of his sons . Why my mother was better off never seeing me become such a pathetic child . ”
92987	92994	92983	92983	Zahra	420	“ You ca n’t believe that . ”
93013	93034	93007	93007	I	199	“ I — I do n’t know . But I changed . There was a shift in my mindset after — ”
93043	93077	93007	93007	I	199	“ I withdrew . Learned everything I could from my brothers and stopped caring about anything but proving my father wrong . I spent every day proving why I was n’t a disappointment . ”
93078	93087	93007	93007	I	199	“ At the expense of what you loved ? ”
93088	93107	93007	93007	I	199	“ It was a price to pay for peace . I did n’t think I would draw again — ”
93108	93116	93007	93007	I	199	“ Until you saw my atrocious drawings . ”
93124	93143	93117	93117	I	199	“ Because I did n’t know it at the time , but I wanted you to see me . ”
93283	93296	93272	93272	His	199	“ I did n’t tell you this for you to pity me . ”
93297	93301	93272	93272	His	199	“ Then why ? ”
93302	93305	93306	93306	His	199	“ Because — ”
93338	93343	93352	93352	his	199	“ You — because — ”
93379	93383	93366	93366	I	199	“ Because what ? ”
93398	93455	93384	93384	His	199	“ Because I like you . It ’s scary as hell because you make me feel everything . And I know I ’ll disappoint you . That I ca n’t promise much , but sometimes I think maybe I could . If I tried hard enough . If I found a way to make things right . ”
93758	93765	93766	93766	His	199	“ Hmm . That ’s unexpected . ”
93784	93789	93766	93766	His	199	“ Ani packed it . ”
93790	93808	93809	93809	He	199	“ Damn . Way to wound my ego . I thought you picked this just for me . ”
93869	93874	93860	93860	he	199	“ Donut You Want Me ”
93892	93913	93860	93860	he	199	“ Do you plan on staring at me all night or are you going to get on with the show ? ”
93922	93928	93914	93914	His	199	“ I like the view . ”
93929	93943	93914	93914	His	199	“ I ’d like mine better if your face was between my legs . ”
94063	94075	94035	94035	My	199	“ If you ’re laughing , there ’s a problem here . ”
94076	94092	94096	94096	me	199	“ I ca n’t help it ! Where did you learn to move like that ? ”
94259	94265	94249	94249	his	199	“ Patience is a virtue . ”
94266	94282	94326	94326	He	199	“ Yeah , so is chastity , but you do n’t see me practicing it . ”
94290	94303	94286	94286	his	199	“ I ’m trying to be a gentleman . Foreplay is important . ”
94304	94325	94249	94249	his	199	“ You fucked me in a car only a couple of weeks ago . The gentleman card has been revoked . ”
94346	94350	94351	94351	He	199	“ Stay here . ”
94527	94535	94538	94538	his	199	“ Prove how much you want me . ”
94714	94746	94708	94708	his	199	“ I ’m not sure what I love more . The way you smile at me without abandon or the way you look with your swollen lips wrapped around my cock . ”
94930	94937	94938	94938	He	199	“ Do n’t you dare swallow . ”
95015	95018	95010	95010	He	199	“ Open . ”
95053	95056	95057	95057	His	199	“ Fuck . ”
95061	95067	95057	95057	His	199	“ Swallow every last drop . ”
95132	95137	95138	95138	He	199	“ You ’re perfect . ”
95479	95487	95466	95466	He	199	“ Taste how much you want me . ”
95628	95640	95620	95620	He	199	“ You were n’t supposed to make me smile or laugh . ”
95657	95677	95678	95678	He	199	“ You were n’t supposed to work your way under my skin like venom with no kind of antidote . ”
95699	95711	95718	95718	I	199	“ And you were never supposed to make me want more . ”
95744	95752	95753	95753	He	199	“ But now it ’s too late . ”
95771	95776	95768	95768	He	199	“ You ’re mine . ”
95836	95840	95841	95841	He	199	“ Say it . ”
95881	95887	95888	95888	He	199	“ Say you ’re mine . ”
95901	95906	95907	95907	I	199	“ I ’m yours , ”
96249	96261	96241	96242	Rowan Zahra	256	“ Are you going to tell me where we are going ? ”
96262	96277	96241	96242	Rowan Zahra	256	“ If I told you , then it would n’t be a surprise anymore . ”
96326	96344	96318	96318	she	1632	“ Does this surprise include something warm to drink ? I can barely feel my toes anymore . ”
96345	96358	96318	96318	she	1632	“ That ’s because your sneakers are n’t meant for this weather . ”
96359	96375	96376	96376	She	1632	“ I do n’t think my sister had a clue how cold it gets here . ”
96417	96433	96396	96396	She	1632	“ You ’re not ready for a Chicago winter if you think this is cold . ”
96434	96447	96396	96396	She	1632	“ I did n’t know I was expecting a Chicago winter anything . ”
96457	96470	96448	96448	I	199	“ You ’re my date for the New Year ’s Eve gala . ”
96471	96496	96448	96448	I	199	“ What kind of selfish people host a gala on New Year ’s ? Do n’t people like to spend it with their families ? ”
96497	96510	96511	96511	I	199	“ Sure , if they ’re ninety and in a retirement home . ”
96550	96589	96523	96523	her	1632	“ Do you ever ask instead of order ? First , it was going to New York . Now it ’s a gala for New Year ’s . Do I have a choice when it comes to you ? ”
96590	96605	96606	96606	I	199	“ Sure . Tonight you can decide how you want to have sex first . ”
96640	96646	96629	96629	She	1632	“ How generous of you . ”
96647	96662	96629	96629	She	1632	“ Come on . We ’re almost there . Just one more street over . ”
96703	96714	96683	96683	Zahra	256	“ Wow . This puts the Dreamland tree to shame ! ”
96749	96755	96736	96736	I	199	“ What do you think ? ”
96756	96784	96736	96736	I	199	“ That this is the closest thing we have to magic . Seriously , how do they even find a tree that large ? The North Pole ? ”
96791	96798	96785	96785	I	199	“ More like somewhere in Connecticut . ”
96799	96806	96807	96807	Zahra	256	“ Way to ruin the dream . ”
96906	96924	96893	96893	she	1632	“ So , how hard would it be to convince you to go ice skating right now ? ”
96972	96978	96979	96979	She	1632	“ Give me your terms . ”
96984	96992	96979	96979	She	1632	“ Everything is a deal for you . ”
96999	97006	96993	96993	I	199	“ You ’re a fast learner . ”
97026	97037	97038	97038	Zahra	256	“ There ’s one last thing I want to do . ”
97055	97064	97065	97065	She	1632	“ Ice skating was n’t enough for you ? ”
97070	97082	97065	97065	She	1632	“ Can we take a walk through Central Park ? Please ? ”
97083	97096	97097	97097	I	199	“ I lost all feeling below my knees about thirty minutes ago . ”
97115	97132	97065	97065	She	1632	“ That ’s because you spent more time on your hands and knees than actually skating . ”
97159	97174	97150	97150	She	1632	“ Come on . It ’s only a quick walk . I googled it . ”
97175	97178	97150	97150	She	1632	“ No . ”
97179	97187	97188	97188	Her	1632	“ Do n’t be such a drag . ”
97200	97208	97150	97150	She	1632	“ Consider myself unmoved by your display . ”
97209	97223	97224	97224	Her	1632	“ Please ? There ’s one last little thing I want to do . ”
97277	97296	97297	97297	I	199	“ Fine . But only for fifteen minutes . Your nose is about to detach from your body . ”
97395	97402	97403	97403	Zahra	256	“ Did you find the buttons ? ”
97433	97438	97439	97439	Zahra	256	“ Yes ! Perfect . ”
97577	97589	97590	97590	I	199	“ Are you sure you ’re twenty - three years old ? ”
97593	97619	97558	97558	she	1632	“ Oh , come on . The closest thing I had to a snowman was one made of sand . Let me live a little . ”
97620	97643	97558	97558	she	1632	“ Remember this moment when you end up stuck in bed with a bowl of chicken soup in a couple of days . ”
97644	97654	97558	97558	she	1632	“ Who cares . We ’re living for today . ”
97655	97672	97558	97558	she	1632	“ That ’s great and all until I lose nine out of ten fingers from frostbite . ”
97673	97679	97680	97680	She	1632	“ Aw , poor baby . ”
97690	97705	97558	97558	she	1632	“ I know something a little lower that could use a warm kiss too . ”
97743	97756	97757	97757	She	1632	“ Let ’s go , Jack Frost . We ’re almost done . ”
97795	97809	97810	97810	Declan	572	“ Where the fuck have you been ? You ’ve been ignoring me , ”
97819	97825	97826	97826	I	199	“ I ’ve been busy . ”
97846	97871	97826	97826	I	199	“ Busy doing what exactly ? Scheduling book signings in New York for no other reason except that you ’re losing your goddamn mind ? ”
97879	97888	97872	97872	My	199	“ How did you find out about that ? ”
97889	97924	97836	97836	Zahra	256	“ I know about everything that happens within the company , including the fact that you took a vacation for the first time in years . What the hell is going on with you ? ”
97925	97932	97872	97872	My	199	“ It ’s a long story . ”
97933	97940	97836	97836	Zahra	256	“ Give me the abridged version . ”
97948	97958	97941	97941	I	199	“ Is this the real reason behind your call ? ”
97959	97982	97872	97872	My	199	“ No , but I want to know why you ’re acting like a dumbass only a few weeks before the vote . ”
97983	97995	97941	97941	I	199	“ I decided to spend a weekend doing something I liked . ”
97996	98006	97872	97872	My	199	“ Save me the bullshit excuse about New York . ”
98007	98024	97941	97941	I	199	“ I do n’t need to give you an excuse . You ’re not my keeper . ”
98025	98054	97872	97872	My	199	“ No , but I ’m the one who ’s going to knock some sense into you when you ’ve clearly lost your goddamn mind over a woman . ”
98064	98070	98059	98059	He	1652	“ Who told you anything ? ”
98071	98081	97941	97941	I	199	“ I have eyes and ears everywhere , Rowan . ”
98082	98105	98059	98059	He	1652	“ Stop poking around in my affairs . If I wanted to tell you what I was up to , I would . ”
98106	98117	97941	97941	I	199	“ No , you would n’t . You never do . ”
98140	98147	98125	98125	He	1652	“ I ’m worried about you . ”
98153	98158	98148	98148	I	199	“ Do n’t be . ”
98197	98223	98125	98125	He	1652	“ I do n’t like the idea of some woman manipulating you into taking time off so close before the vote . It ’s suspicious . ”
98229	98244	98224	98224	My	199	“ I do n’t see how that ’s possible when it was my idea . ”
98245	98251	98252	98252	He	1652	“ You actually like her ? ”
98256	98264	98224	98224	My	199	“ Is that so hard to believe ? ”
98265	98281	98224	98224	My	199	“ And to think I considered you my more intelligent brother . What a disappointment . ”
98287	98315	98282	98282	My	199	“ Declan , I ’m in the middle of something so either get to the point of your phone call or I ’m going to hang up . ”
98316	98329	98224	98224	My	199	“ The letters have been sent to Grandpa ’s chosen voting committee . ”
98342	98350	98339	98339	I	199	“ Any word on who he picked ? ”
98351	98371	98282	98282	My	199	“ No , but you need to get your shit together because we ’re all depending on your presentation . ”
98372	98393	98339	98339	I	199	“ I ’ve been prepping for months . There ’s no way I do n’t have this vote locked down . ”
98394	98426	98282	98282	My	199	“ Good . Once you get the approving votes , you ’ll spend a month transitioning the next Director into the role and they ’ll take on the project from there . ”
98427	98452	98339	98339	I	199	“ I thought while you were settling everything with your part of the letter , I could stay here and oversee the project myself . ”
98522	98529	98530	98530	He	572	“ I thought you were joking . ”
98537	98557	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ No . What ’s the point in me moving back if you still have n’t gotten married yet ? ”
98558	98584	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ You ’re going to shadow me and take over a portion of my CFO role so I can concentrate on finding my future wife . ”
98590	98617	98585	98585	My	199	“ Give me six more months as the Director . It ’ll be less confusing for the employees to have a Director for a whole year . ”
98618	98628	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ Since when do you care about confusing employees ? ”
98629	98637	98585	98585	My	199	“ It ’s my job to care . ”
98648	98667	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ No . It ’s your job to finish up and move back to Chicago after the vote . ”
98668	98692	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ Grandpa said I have to be Director for at least six months . But he never stated when I had to leave . ”
98693	98730	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ I ’m well aware of what Grandpa said . It does n’t change the outcome for you . I ’ve already chosen the next Director and he will be contacting your secretary after the vote . ”
98731	98753	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ You ’re not the CEO yet . You ca n’t force me to move back whenever you snap your fingers . ”
98754	98787	98638	98638	Declan	572	“ Let ’s be real . The only reason you ’re interested in staying there is because of a woman . You do n’t even like Dreamland , so cut the shit . ”
98795	98809	98788	98788	My	199	“ No . That ’s not true . I actually enjoy this job . ”
98832	98878	98824	98824	I	199	“ Rowan , if you really want to be the Director , you can go back to Dreamland once I secure my CEO position . Until then , let ’s get everything sorted out with each of our letters before you go changing the plans . ”
99082	99085	99076	99076	I	199	“ Okay . ”
99134	99144	99145	99145	Claire	420	“ You ca n’t go to work like this . ”
99265	99283	99258	99258	I	199	“ I have to go . We do n’t have much time left before the project deadline . ”
99284	99298	99306	99306	She	1667	“ One day off is n’t going to make much of a difference . ”
99299	99305	99258	99258	I	199	“ But I need to — ”
99311	99333	99306	99306	She	1667	“ But nothing . I already made you some chicken soup last night after I heard you hacking up your lung . ”
99343	99347	99334	99334	I	199	“ Thank you . ”
99348	99362	99306	99306	She	1667	“ It ’s the least I could do . You look like death . ”
99363	99370	99371	99371	My	199	“ I feel like it too . ”
99858	99871	99872	99872	Rowan	256	“ Come on , Zahra . You ’ve got to eat something . ”
99981	99984	99985	99985	He	256	“ Zahra . ”
99992	99996	99997	99997	I	199	“ Go away , ”
100058	100064	100052	100052	I	199	“ You need to shave . ”
100080	100090	100091	100091	He	256	“ You slept through breakfast , lunch , and — ”
100099	100116	100091	100091	He	256	“ Dinner . It ’s time to get some food in you before you pass out . ”
100130	100136	100137	100137	I	199	“ Shh . Talk lower . ”
100145	100152	100137	100137	I	199	“ Wake me up in another — ”
100172	100183	100184	100184	His	256	“ Here . Take a sip of water . Please . ”
100204	100208	100199	100199	I	199	“ Happy now ? ”
100212	100215	100209	100209	He	256	“ No . ”
100216	100224	100188	100188	He	256	“ I feel like I ’m dying . ”
100232	100243	100225	100225	His	256	“ Do n’t be dramatic . You have a cold . ”
100253	100256	100257	100257	I	199	“ Okay . ”
100266	100278	100257	100257	I	199	“ I ’ll be up in an hour . I promise . ”
100279	100293	100250	100250	his	256	“ I ’m going to call a doctor to come check on you . ”
100294	100301	100257	100257	I	199	“ Doctors still do house calls ? ”
100302	100308	100250	100250	his	256	“ For the right price . ”
100359	100368	100352	100352	His	256	“ Shit . I ’ll be right back . ”
100460	100471	100449	100449	I	199	“ She ’s been sick for three days straight already . ”
100472	100477	100478	100478	I	199	“ Three days ? ! ”
100514	100529	100544	100544	He	256	“ In my professional opinion , she needs to be taken to a hospital . ”
100530	100533	100534	100534	Rowan	256	“ Hospital ? ”
100626	100637	100616	100617	The doctor	2386	“ She ’s severely dehydrated and needs proper medical care . ”
100638	100644	100616	100617	The doctor	2386	“ Anything else you suggest ? ”
100645	100707	100616	100617	The doctor	2386	“ Based on the symptoms you described and what I see and hear , it ’s probably some kind of viral pneumonia . Her tissues are covered with green mucus and she has a fever . If you do n’t take her to the hospital tonight , she ’s going to end up in the back of an ambulance soon enough . ”
100943	100946	100947	100947	I	199	“ Zahra ? ”
101013	101016	101017	101017	I	199	“ Shit ! ”
101057	101066	101067	101067	My	199	“ Zahra ? Zahra ! Are you okay ? ”
101227	101230	101231	101231	I	199	“ Zahra . ”
101298	101301	101294	101294	My	199	“ Zahra ! ”
101336	101342	101322	101322	Her	1697	“ Zahra . Wake up ! ”
101412	101421	101422	101422	I	199	“ Come on , Zahra . Wake up . ”
101445	101450	101451	101451	I	199	“ Thank fucking Christ . ”
101507	101510	101511	101511	I	199	“ Fuck ! ”
102098	102103	102104	102104	She	228	“ Are you family ? ”
102123	102126	102155	102155	She	228	“ What ? ”
102127	102132	102133	102133	Her	228	“ Family or friend ? ”
102137	102140	102141	102141	I	199	“ Fiancé . ”
102174	102180	102181	102181	She	228	“ Fine . Follow me . ”
102289	102300	102301	102301	I	199	“ I want my fiancée placed in a private room , ”
102312	102332	102305	102305	She	1715	“ Once she ’s stabilized , that ’s up to her insurance policy . Is she on your plan ? ”
102401	102411	102400	102400	Zahra	256	“ Ani , can you shut off the alarm ? ”
102418	102421	102400	102400	Zahra	256	“ Ani . ”
102532	102537	102538	102538	Rowan	256	“ She ’s awake . ”
102598	102603	102604	102604	He	256	“ Do n’t move . ”
102612	102618	102619	102619	my	199	“ What ’s going on ? ”
102647	102654	102635	102635	He	256	“ You ’re in the hospital . ”
102665	102679	102655	102655	I	199	“ I gathered that much . But how did I end up here ? ”
102741	102746	102733	102733	I	199	“ Are you okay ? ”
102747	102752	102753	102753	He	256	“ I will be . ”
102785	102797	102753	102753	He	256	“ Do you want to tell me why I ’m here ? ”
102813	102840	102807	102807	he	256	“ You were dehydrated , bleeding from your head , and tempting fate . You ’re lucky to be in this bed rather than the morgue . ”
102841	102856	102857	102857	My	199	“ Morgue ? That ’s drastic for a couple of stitches and a cold . ”
102896	102919	102920	102920	He	199	“ Do n’t touch . With your good fortune , you ’ll pull a stitch and bleed all over your new gown . ”
102935	102944	102920	102920	He	199	“ How did I end up getting stitches ? ”
102953	102971	102945	102945	He	199	“ I found you passed out in my bathroom after you knocked your head against the floor . ”
102972	102977	102978	102978	My	199	“ Oh my God . ”
102996	103000	102945	102945	He	199	“ What hurts ? ”
103001	103010	103011	103011	I	199	“ The real question is what does n’t . ”
103019	103025	102945	102945	He	199	“ Do n’t do that . ”
103031	103041	103026	103026	I	199	“ I ca n’t believe I ended up here . ”
103046	103061	103042	103042	He	199	“ The doctor says you ’ll go home by the end of the week . ”
103062	103068	103026	103026	I	199	“ What day is it ? ”
103069	103072	103042	103042	He	199	“ Friday . ”
103073	103077	103078	103078	I	199	“ Friday ? ! ”
103109	103127	103042	103042	He	199	“ You ’ve been in and out of it from your fever and then your head injury . ”
103128	103137	103042	103042	He	199	“ How many days have I been here ? ”
103138	103155	103042	103042	He	199	“ Two . They want to keep you here for observation before letting you go home . ”
103161	103168	103156	103156	I	199	“ This all sounds so expensive . ”
103173	103186	103169	103169	His	199	“ The only thing you need to worry about is getting better . ”
103187	103213	103214	103214	I	199	“ That ’s easy for you to say . I ca n’t afford any kind of deductible that includes oxygen therapy and overnight hospital stays . ”
103238	103245	103235	103235	his	199	“ It ’s already paid for . ”
103267	103277	103259	103259	he	199	“ I do n’t know how to repay you . ”
103283	103291	103278	103278	His	199	“ I do n’t need your money . ”
103292	103297	103298	103298	My	199	“ Is everything okay ? ”
103311	103320	103305	103305	He	199	“ It ’s good you ’re more coherent . ”
103346	103369	103305	103305	He	199	“ I ’m sorry you had to go through all this . I ca n’t imagine how scary it was for you . ”
103377	103422	103423	103423	His	199	“ I was terrified , Zahra . I found you barely breathing , with too much blood coming out of your head . And when I got you to wake up , you were talking gibberish . I thought you had permanent brain damage . ”
103427	103455	103423	103423	His	199	“ The few minutes before the ambulance got to my house were the scariest of my damn life and I could n’t do anything to fix it . ”
103468	103484	103508	103508	he	199	“ I ’m really sorry . I do n’t even remember going to the bathroom . ”
103485	103493	103494	103494	He	199	“ Stop apologizing . You sound ridiculous . ”
103515	103520	103508	103508	he	199	“ Minus the amazing ? ”
103547	103556	103542	103542	I	199	“ Are you sure that you ’re okay ? ”
103557	103570	103531	103531	I	199	“ Stop worrying about me and save your energy for what matters . ”
103633	103642	103620	103620	His	199	“ I mean it , Zahra . Relax . ”
103643	103651	103652	103652	I	199	“ Will you stay while I sleep ? ”
103739	103744	103726	103726	He	1732	“ I ’ll stay . ”
103793	103796	103797	103797	Ani	2278	“ Uno ! ”
104073	104107	104108	104109	The nurse	1715	“ The doctor should be stopping by soon to check on you . You ’re responding nicely to the antibiotics , which means you might be able to get out of here tonight . ”
104157	104174	104146	104146	She	1715	“ I need to go . JP is waiting in the parking lot with his mom . ”
104190	104194	104195	104195	I	199	“ Have fun ! ”
104206	104209	104201	104201	Ani	2278	“ Gross . ”
104281	104288	104265	104265	I	199	“ Is everything okay ? Really ? ”
104298	104303	104289	104289	His	256	“ It will be . ”
104323	104335	104336	104336	He	256	“ Are you still upset about what happened in your house ? ”
104347	104350	104336	104336	He	256	“ No . ”
104351	104388	104389	104389	My	199	“ Then what ’s going on ? Tell me something more than a few words strung together . Something happened , and unless you ’re open with me about it , I ca n’t fix it . ”
104404	104423	104400	104400	His	256	“ There ’s nothing to fix . You need to concentrate on getting better rather than on us . ”
104424	104431	104432	104432	I	199	“ Is there still an us ? ”
104460	104465	104466	104466	He	256	“ I — you — ”
104483	104497	104498	104498	I	199	“ I need you to tell me what ’s bothering you . Now . ”
104538	104549	104519	104519	Rowan	256	“ We can talk about this once you ’re hom — ”
104550	104562	104519	104519	Rowan	256	“ Cut the bullshit , Rowan . What ’s your problem ? ”
104570	104580	104563	104563	His	256	“ You want to know what ’s my problem ? ”
104584	104592	104593	104593	He	256	“ You . This whole damn situation . ”
104608	104614	104603	104603	My	199	“ What do you mean ? ”
104615	104683	104687	104687	He	256	“ We were supposed to be something casual . Something fun . This is n’t even close to what I want or need in my life . I have a company to run , a park to oversee , and a lot of shit to work through . People are depending on me , and I ’m stuck making sure you ’re okay because I feel responsible . ”
104701	104719	104687	104687	He	256	“ I never asked to play your dutiful boyfriend . That ’s not the man I am . ”
104728	104737	104720	104720	My	199	“ You … you ca n’t mean that . ”
104774	104800	104769	104769	He	256	“ Us hooking up and going on a couple of dates was supposed to be a way for me to pass some time at Dreamland . ”
104801	104806	104809	104809	he	256	“ Pass some time . ”
104822	104832	104817	104817	He	256	“ I ’ve lost track of what ’s important . ”
104875	104917	104868	104868	he	256	“ I never take off time for work — not even on Christmas . But I felt obligated because you got hurt in my house . I ’ve even postponed important meetings and blown off a shit ton of paperwork because … ”
104918	104922	104924	104924	you	1747	“ Because what ? ”
105023	105056	105016	105016	I	199	“ I do n’t know what ’s more pathetic — the fact that you deny how much you care about me or the way I ’m actually surprised by all of this . ”
105080	105129	105075	105075	I	199	“ The problem is n’t work . And it ’s definitely not us changing from casual to more , which is your own damn fault when you kept doing things that showed you cared . You made me believe in some fantasy . You made me want more . ”
105140	105156	105130	105130	His	199	“ I always meant to keep things casual . That ’s what we agreed on . ”
105157	105189	105130	105130	His	199	“ Well , you did a really shitty job at that . You did n’t have to play the role of a dutiful boyfriend because you were already acting like one ! ”
105208	105245	105203	105203	I	199	“ Every decision you ’ve made up until this point has all been because you care . Because deep down , I think you love me even though you ’re too damn scared to admit it . ”
105262	105298	105203	105203	I	199	“ Love was never an option . If I made you believe otherwise , I apologize . I would never subject you to that kind of misbelief when I ’m moving back to Chicago soon . ”
105307	105310	105299	105299	He	199	“ What ? ”
105319	105334	105311	105311	He	199	“ A new Director will be taking over Dreamland at the end of January . ”
105359	105363	105364	105364	I	199	“ Did you — ”
105367	105379	105364	105364	I	199	“ Did you know this the entire time we were together ? ”
105426	105429	105441	105441	Rowan	256	“ Yes . ”
105430	105437	105439	105439	us	1749	“ Did you consider staying longer … ”
105454	105463	105441	105441	Rowan	256	“ I was always meant to go back . ”
105496	105520	105469	105469	Zahra	256	“ That ’s not what I asked , and you know it . Stop playing your mind games and tell me the truth . ”
105525	105535	105521	105521	His	199	“ My personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant . ”
105544	105551	105536	105536	I	199	“ Why are you moving back ? ”
105564	105571	105536	105536	I	199	“ My future is in Chicago . ”
105592	105597	105598	105598	My	199	“ So you say . ”
105633	105645	105627	105627	his	1754	“ I regret hurting you . This was all a mistake . ”
105806	105814	105815	105815	His	1754	“ I ’m sorry for hurting you . ”
105840	105862	105815	105815	His	1754	“ And I ’m sorry for ever thinking you were better than the selfish , cruel man everyone labels you as . ”
105889	105893	105883	105883	He	1754	“ I see . ”
105909	105953	105904	105904	I	199	“ I ’ll find a way to repay you for everything because I want nothing to do with you or your money again . Even if it takes me my whole life to pay off this damn room , I ’ll do it . ”
105958	105964	105954	105954	His	1754	“ I do n’t want — ”
105980	105990	105970	105970	he	1754	“ I ’m feeling tired all of a sudden . ”
105994	106011	105991	105991	He	1754	“ Of course . I never meant to distress you while you ’re feeling this way . ”
106016	106029	106030	106030	He	1754	“ Do you want me to stay until your parents come back ? ”
106040	106055	106056	106056	My	199	“ No . I ’d rather be alone , but thanks for everything again . ”
106069	106072	106056	106056	My	199	“ But — ”
106161	106169	106150	106150	He	256	“ You deserve the world and more . ”
106846	106849	106850	106850	I	199	“ Hey . ”
106863	106878	106857	106857	She	2278	“ Hi . Can I help you with picking out some candy , sir ? ”
106879	106885	106886	106886	I	199	“ Come on , Ani . ”
106906	106916	106895	106895	Her	2278	“ I do n’t want to talk to you . ”
106917	106926	106895	106895	Her	2278	“ Too bad . I ’m your boss . ”
106951	106956	106957	106957	She	2278	“ Spit it out . ”
106983	106990	106991	106991	Ani	2278	“ I thought we were friends . ”
107046	107055	107041	107041	She	2278	“ That was before you hurt my sister . ”
107056	107066	107041	107041	She	2278	“ So what ? We ’re not friends anymore ? ”
107067	107070	107041	107041	She	2278	“ Nope . ”
107071	107078	107041	107041	She	2278	“ You do n’t mean that . ”
107082	107094	107079	107079	She	2278	“ Zahra ’s my best friend and you made her cry . ”
107103	107110	107097	107097	I	199	“ Your sister and I are — ”
107111	107118	107119	107119	Ani	2278	“ Done . She told me . ”
107125	107135	107119	107119	Ani	2278	“ I did n’t mean to hurt you too . ”
107136	107151	107152	107152	Her	2278	“ I helped you hurt her . With the pumpkins , and New York . ”
107181	107189	107190	107190	I	199	“ None of this is your fault . ”
107203	107223	107252	107252	Damn	187	“ No . It ’s yours because you ’re a big baby who ca n’t admit you like her . ”
107233	107241	107224	107224	I	199	“ If only life was that simple . ”
107242	107251	107252	107252	Damn	187	“ You told me excuses are for losers . ”
107308	107321	107305	107305	She	2278	“ Thanks for helping me and making me feel better about moving . ”
107335	107338	107323	107323	she	2278	“ Ani — ”
107339	107352	107353	107353	She	2278	“ You ’re not my friend or buddy anymore . I quit . ”
107410	107413	107414	107414	Someone	2058	“ Ani ! ”
107419	107433	107434	107434	She	2278	“ I ’ve got to get going . Merry early Christmas , Rowan . ”
108497	108503	108504	108504	She	197	“ Is that a wheelchair ? ”
108616	108625	108608	108608	Her	197	“ What do you want , Mr. Kane ? ”
108653	108661	108644	108644	She	197	“ I needed to speak with you . ”
108679	108684	108644	108644	She	197	“ I came to … ”
108700	108703	108662	108662	She	197	“ Yes ? ”
108704	108714	108728	108728	She	197	“ To ask if you would come over tonight . ”
108720	108725	108715	108715	Her	197	“ You ’re joking . ”
108749	108771	108728	108728	She	197	“ No — shit . I ’m not saying this right . I want to talk to you . Just talk . ”
108772	108786	108787	108787	She	197	“ Yeah , well , I do n’t want to talk to you . ”
108882	108917	108870	108870	she	197	“ Zahra , hear me out . I ca n’t sleep . I ca n’t eat . I ’m stuck in a constant state of nausea and heartburn , no matter what I eat . ”
108918	108927	108928	108928	She	197	“ Sounds like you can feel after all . ”
108931	108964	108992	108992	she	197	“ Yes . Are you happy ? I feel like shit , ever since I left you in that damn hospital room , knowing full well you were crying because of me . ”
108965	108991	108992	108992	she	197	“ No . I ’m not happy that you ’re upset . On the contrary , I want you to be happy with your choices , ”
109008	109011	108992	108992	she	197	“ Why ? ”
109025	109046	108992	108992	she	197	“ Because I want you to look back on your choices and know they were worth it in the end . ”
109087	109136	109137	109137	My	199	“ Give me a chance to explain myself . I ’ve been … thinking about everything . And I made a mistake . I should n’t have let you go because I was afraid . You were right . But I want to try again . With you . ”
109161	109182	109148	109148	She	197	“ No . I ’m not falling for this again . I gave you a chance and you blew it . ”
109183	109186	109148	109148	She	197	“ But — ”
109187	109229	109148	109148	She	197	“ No buts . What happens if you change your mind again ? I wo n’t take that risk . I ’ve been through enough , and honestly , I deserve better than anything you could half - heartedly offer me . ”
109245	109260	109241	109241	Her	197	“ I need to get back to work . I ’m on a deadline . ”
109261	109273	109274	109274	I	199	“ I could help you with that . No strings attached . ”
109290	109298	109299	109299	She	197	“ I think you ’ve done enough . ”
109483	109493	109494	109494	Claire	420	“ This ended up in my stack of mail . ”
109504	109512	109513	109513	I	199	“ This is from two weeks ago ! ”
109522	109540	109519	109519	She	420	“ I know , and I ’m sorry . I promise to get more organized next week . ”
109548	109554	109541	109541	I	199	“ You always say that ! ”
110542	110547	110537	110537	she	420	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
110548	110556	110537	110537	she	420	“ That fact that Rowan was born . ”
110557	110568	110537	110537	she	420	“ I thought we blacklisted his name from the apartment ! ”
110569	110585	110537	110537	she	420	“ That was before I received a letter from Brady Kane that exposed his grandson . ”
110596	110600	110586	110586	Claire	420	“ WHAT ? ! ”
110693	110702	110703	110703	She	420	“ That no good , piece of shit — ”
110715	110721	110758	110758	Claire	420	“ What are you doing ? ”
110722	110740	110758	110758	Claire	420	“ I ’m trying to calculate how long someone can survive from blood loss after being castrated . ”
110749	110757	110741	110741	I	199	“ Physical aggression is never the answer . ”
110775	110790	110763	110763	she	420	“ Oh , Zahra . It ’s cute how innocent you see the world . ”
110791	110796	110758	110758	Claire	420	“ And that is ? ”
110797	110809	110763	110763	she	420	“ Like you were never told Santa Claus is n’t real . ”
110819	110828	110810	110810	I	199	“ What ? ! Santa ’s not real ? ”
110837	110840	110829	110829	Claire	420	“ Fool . ”
110841	110871	110829	110829	Claire	420	“ Seriously . Your answer to everything is to cut , maim , and kill . That ’s not really the kind of solution I ’m looking for here . ”
110872	110884	110829	110829	Claire	420	“ Only because you could n’t afford a good lawyer after . ”
110900	110905	110885	110885	We	1852	“ Seriously . Castration ? ”
110906	110923	110829	110829	Claire	420	“ You know how the saying goes . Act like a dick , lose said dick . ”
110930	110936	110928	110928	me	199	“ No one says that ! ”
110937	110972	110885	110885	We	1852	“ Then maybe it ’s time people did . I mean that fucker seriously thinks he can manipulate you like that ? Un - freaking - believable ! Does he even have a conscience ? ”
110981	110984	110985	110985	I	199	“ Debatable . ”
111357	111393	111394	111394	She	75	“ Today , I ’m presenting something a little different . It ’s not exactly about a ride , so I understand if it is n’t accepted as an option for Mr. Kane ’s project . ”
111420	111511	111404	111404	she	75	“ I ’m interested in making Dreamland more inclusive for our guests . As a salon worker , I met lots of children who experienced life ’s hardest challenges . I began to take notice and write down their concerns . After years of working , I came to one conclusion . As a sister of someone with challenges herself , I understood the guests ’ chief complaints — even though I think my sister would punch my arm if she heard me use that kind of C - word . ”
111548	111622	111632	111632	she	1048	“ Dreamland is n’t only made for the more privileged who can afford quick skip passes , hundred - dollar entrance tickets , and overpriced food and drinks . It ’s made for the able - bodied . For those kids who were born with a leg up — no pun intended . So my idea is to change the very foundation of the park and shift the way we view our guests . ”
111893	111930	111885	111885	Jenny	75	“ Amazing job , Zahra . You ’re going to do such big things one day . I just know it . It ’s a shame we wo n’t have you here after the holiday break . ”
111938	111942	111931	111931	I	199	“ Repeat that . ”
111948	111973	111943	111943	Jenny	75	“ Oh , sorry , Mr. Kane . I did n’t think you wanted to be kept up to date on things like these . ”
112010	112015	112000	112000	I	199	“ You ’re quitting ? ”
112016	112028	111987	111987	her	75	“ I gave Jenny my two weeks ’ notice on Tuesday . ”
112077	112084	112085	112085	I	199	“ Today is your last day ? ”
112094	112103	112088	112088	Jenny	75	“ We ’ll all miss her very much . ”
112215	112224	112225	112225	I	199	“ Everyone is dismissed except for Ms. Gulian . ”
112310	112316	112291	112291	I	199	“ You ca n’t quit . ”
112317	112324	112340	112340	She	75	“ I can and I did . ”
112332	112339	112325	112325	My	199	“ But we had a deal . ”
112343	112362	112340	112340	She	75	“ Today was the last day of our presentations anyway . It ’s out of our hands now . ”
112363	112377	112397	112397	She	75	“ There are going to be other ideas that need Creators ’ input . ”
112384	112392	112378	112378	She	75	“ That ’s no longer my business . ”
112393	112396	112340	112340	She	75	“ Zahra — ”
112406	112413	112397	112397	She	75	“ Why did you hire me ? ”
112419	112449	112414	112414	I	199	“ Because you ’re good at what you do . Today is a perfect example of how talented you are . Imagine what else we could do if you — ”
112475	112484	112485	112485	Her	75	“ Why could n’t you leave me alone ? ”
112489	112501	112485	112485	Her	75	“ Why did you have to manipulate my feelings for you ? ”
112510	112513	112502	112502	I	199	“ What ? ”
112527	112552	112514	112514	She	75	“ Did you hire me as a Creator because you wanted me to become emotionally invested in the project before your grandfather ’s vote ? ”
112559	112562	112514	112514	She	75	“ Vote ? ”
112568	112590	112563	112563	Her	75	“ I was chosen for Brady ’s committee , but I ’m sure you already knew that . Did n’t you ? ”
112741	112748	112749	112749	Her	75	“ Was any of it real ? ”
112753	112759	112760	112760	I	199	“ Of course it was . ”
112781	112793	112794	112794	I	199	“ I never knew about you being chosen for the vote , ”
112797	112830	112831	112831	Her	75	“ And what , I ’m supposed to believe anything that comes out of your mouth ? All you ’ve done is lie or tell half - truths ever since we met . ”
112879	112911	112912	112912	She	75	“ You have to believe me on this . I knew a vote would happen — that much is true — but I had no idea who my grandfather would pick . ”
112917	112932	112912	112912	She	75	“ It does n’t matter what you say . I ca n’t trust you . ”
112958	112980	112947	112947	her	75	“ I swear I ’m not lying . I know I might have hidden some truths and lied to you in the past”—she
112984	113002	112947	112947	her	75	words—“but I would never use you for something like a vote . I ’m better than that . ”
113012	113066	113003	113003	She	75	“ That ’s the thing , Rowan . I think you think you ’re better than that , but from everything I ’ve seen , I have no reason to believe you ’re anything but selfish . You choose to think about one person and one person only — and that ’s yourself . ”
113131	113178	113122	113122	She	75	“ I ’m quitting because I have no interest in working for you or your company anymore . I want to work for a place that wants to make a real difference in people ’s lives because they care , and your company is n’t it . ”
113381	113388	113389	113389	He	1889	“ Rowan . Come on in . ”
113447	113463	113441	113441	I	199	“ That ’s not necessary . I have a couple of questions to ask you . ”
113474	113477	113470	113470	he	1889	“ Okay . ”
113478	113496	113441	113441	I	199	“ Do you think Mom would be proud of the man you ’ve become since she died ? ”
113551	113558	113559	113559	His	1889	“ No . I do n’t . ”
113563	113569	113559	113559	His	1889	“ Why did you change ? ”
113570	113596	113559	113559	His	1889	“ Because I was an angry , pathetic man who wanted to drown everyone in my grief so they could feel hurt like I hurt . ”
113645	113650	113631	113631	He	212	“ Any other questions ? ”
113651	113662	113631	113631	He	212	“ Do you regret falling in love with my mother ? ”
113663	113668	113631	113631	He	212	“ Not at all . ”
113691	113695	113680	113680	he	212	“ Why not ? ”
113696	113719	113720	113720	He	212	“ You ’ll learn that the best rewards come with the biggest consequences . Because nothing that great is given for free . ”
113922	113931	113919	113919	I	199	“ That ’s all I needed to know . ”
113994	113997	113983	113983	I	199	“ No . ”
114008	114017	113998	113998	My	199	“ I did n’t ask for your permission . ”
114025	114035	114018	114018	Cal	46	“ Are we seriously going to fight on Christmas ? ”
114040	114047	114036	114036	I	199	“ I ’m not coming back . ”
114048	114056	114057	114057	Cal	46	“ Okay . I guess we are . ”
114069	114089	114090	114090	He	46	“ Finally , it ’s your turn to be the problem child for once . Welcome to the club . ”
114107	114116	114096	114096	Declan	572	“ We already discussed this in - depth . ”
114117	114148	114096	114096	Declan	572	“ It does n’t matter what we decided before . Things change , and I ’m not giving up my position as the Director , so find a new CFO . ”
114157	114184	114152	114152	Declan	572	“ How could you possibly prefer being the Director of a theme park over becoming the CFO of one of the top companies in the world ? ”
114185	114217	114218	114218	Declan	572	“ Because I met someone special and I ’m not going to give her up for some goddamn desk job thousands of miles away where I would be miserable without her . ”
114226	114230	114231	114231	Cal	46	“ Holy shit , ”
114237	114242	114231	114231	Cal	46	“ Are you serious ? ”
114253	114260	114246	114246	Cal	46	“ What have you been hiding ? ”
114261	114272	114231	114231	Cal	46	“ Nothing I want you poking your limp dick around . ”
114273	114294	114295	114295	Cal	46	“ Now I definitely need to visit Dreamland . Our baby brother has been keeping some big secrets from us . ”
114307	114320	114302	114302	Declan	572	“ It ’s only considered a secret if I had no idea . ”
114326	114340	114321	114321	Cal	46	“ You knew this whole time and you did n’t tell me ? ! ”
114341	114371	114397	114397	Declan	572	“ He took a vacation . That in itself was a cause for alarm . Try to use some of the few brain cells you have left , Callahan . ”
114372	114376	114377	114377	He	46	“ Fuck you . ”
114389	114396	114377	114377	He	46	“ I hate feeling left out . ”
114404	114416	114397	114397	Declan	572	“ You ’re doing all of this because of a girl ? ”
114417	114439	114465	114465	Declan	572	“ No . I ’m doing this because I like who I strive to be when I ’m with that girl . ”
114440	114453	114454	114454	Cal	46	“ Damn . Rowan might not speak much but when he does — ”
114461	114464	114454	114454	Cal	46	“ Poetry . ”
114477	114486	114465	114465	Declan	572	“ You ’ve completely lost your goddamn mind . ”
114490	114500	114487	114487	I	199	“ Maybe . But at least it ’s fun . ”
114504	114518	114519	114519	Declan	572	“ You ’ll be begging me for the CFO position in six months . ”
114529	114534	114524	114524	I	199	“ I wo n’t . ”
114547	114571	114535	114535	Cal	46	“ Cheer up , buttercup . I can lend a hand and help you with your duties until you find a new replacement . ”
114572	114585	114535	114535	Cal	46	“ The job requires more math abilities than adding two plus two . ”
114586	114596	114597	114597	Cal	46	“ I think my little brain can keep up . ”
114633	114671	114629	114629	I	199	“ You know , Iris could help you with some of the workload . I saw how well you worked together , and she could definitely handle some of your tasks while you search for a wife . ”
114677	114688	114672	114672	Declan	572	“ Maybe . I ’ll have to think it over . ”
114689	114703	114704	114704	Cal	46	“ Rowan , we ’re supposed to protest against Iris working more hours . ”
114707	114726	114704	114704	Cal	46	“ Poor girl probably forgot what the sun looks like with all the hours Declan makes her work . ”
114938	114944	114930	114930	Claire	420	“ What do you want ? ”
114945	114950	114930	114930	Claire	420	“ Is Zahra home ? ”
114951	114956	114930	114930	Claire	420	“ It ’s Christmas . ”
114957	114974	114930	114930	Claire	420	“ But you ’re here , and she would n’t leave you alone on a holiday . ”
114990	115000	114984	114984	I	199	“ She does n’t want to speak to you . ”
115001	115009	115010	115010	I	199	“ I ’ll let her decide that , ”
115022	115029	115017	115017	She	84	“ Why are you really here ? ”
115030	115043	114984	114984	I	199	“ Because I need to talk to her . It ’s important . ”
115049	115053	115044	115044	She	84	“ On Christmas ? ”
115054	115061	115062	115062	Zahra	420	“ Claire ? Who is it ? ”
115121	115124	115125	115125	My	199	“ Zahra . ”
115138	115145	115134	115134	She	84	“ I got this , Claire . ”
115146	115150	115151	115152	Her friend	1913	“ You sure ? ”
115197	115205	115206	115206	Zahra	256	“ What do you want , Rowan ? ”
115211	115217	115187	115187	she	420	“ I want to talk . ”
115218	115222	115187	115187	she	420	“ On Christmas ? ”
115259	115275	115246	115246	I	199	“ I brought an activity to convince you to give me an hour to talk . ”
115280	115285	115276	115276	Her	420	“ Are you serious ? ”
115289	115325	115286	115286	I	199	“ Yes ? I researched the best strategies for gingerbread house making and thought we could give it a try while you hear me out . I even bought popsicle sticks to work as stabilizers . ”
115336	115353	115326	115326	She	420	“ I thought we could make homemade icing because the one in the box looks disgusting . ”
115364	115382	115355	115355	I	199	“ Oh my God . You actually think a gingerbread house is going to make things better ? ”
115385	115403	115404	115404	She	420	“ Well , no . But I remember you mentioning how much you liked them , and — ”
115467	115495	115574	115574	Her	420	“ Rowan , you ended things with me . We ca n’t just pick up where we left off and pretend to go back to something casual . ”
115496	115507	115574	115574	Her	420	“ Good because I do n’t want anything casual anymore . ”
115512	115524	115508	115508	Her	420	“ You ’re only doing all this because of the vote . ”
115531	115573	115525	115525	I	199	“ I ’m not doing this for a damn vote . If you want to vote against me , then do it . Hell , I encourage you to , as long as you give me a chance to explain myself . ”
115596	115626	115582	115582	I	199	“ I mean it . Go ahead and do what feels right . The vote is the last thing on my mind right now . You ’re more important . ”
115656	115742	115637	115637	She	420	“ I wish I could believe you . I really do . But I ’m tired of giving people all the chances in the world , only for them to realize I ’m not worth it in the end . Because I am , and no one is going to convince me otherwise anymore . Not even you . I do n’t want to be used for entertainment while passing the time , just like I do n’t want to be labeled as some mistake . ”
115843	115849	115850	115850	She	420	“ Merry Christmas , Rowan . ”
116254	116257	116258	116258	I	199	“ Martha ! ”
116267	116279	116258	116258	I	199	“ Is Mr. Kane asking you to help him set up ? ”
116285	116298	116280	116280	She	57	“ Nope . The late Mr. Kane asked me to be here . ”
116299	116302	116303	116303	She	57	“ Really ? ”
116311	116339	116303	116303	She	57	“ Do n’t sound so surprised . I worked for that man for decades . I know this park better than him , and he knew it . ”
116514	116527	116509	116509	Martha	57	“ Now , now . This is n’t the time for anger . ”
116537	116543	116528	116528	I	199	“ I ’m not upset . ”
116550	116561	116544	116544	She	57	“ It shows you still care about him . Good . ”
116570	116581	116544	116544	She	57	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ”
116582	116587	116588	116588	She	57	“ Oh , darling . ”
116593	116629	116588	116588	She	57	“ I put two and two together when Mr. Kane asked me to get him Juliana De La Rosa on the line . And given our conversation about her books , I connected the dots . ”
116676	116686	116710	116710	She	57	“ Did Rowan know you were on the board ? ”
116687	116704	116710	116710	She	57	“ Rowan ? God , no . I ca n’t wait to see his reaction later . ”
116718	116732	116710	116710	She	57	“ Wait . Did you think Rowan knew you were on the board ? ”
116768	116781	116759	116759	She	57	“ No . That ’s half the fun in today ’s meeting . ”
116782	116785	116759	116759	She	57	“ Fun ? ”
116786	116812	116759	116759	She	57	“ Of course . Brady had a flare for the dramatics . This whole shindig is his way of making his grandkids work for it . ”
116813	116818	116759	116759	She	57	“ Work for what ? ”
116972	116983	116987	116987	his	256	“ Ms. Gulian . Thank you for being here today . ”
117024	117028	117019	117019	I	199	“ Mr. Kane . ”
117062	117069	117070	117070	She	57	“ Have you seen it yet ? ”
117158	117206	117207	117207	I	199	“ My grandfather asked me to determine Dreamland ’s weaknesses and create something worthy of his legacy . Upon first inspection of the park , I had wondered what I could possibly do that has n’t been thought of before . Dreamland in many ways is perfect . ”
117252	117320	117321	117322	Mr. Kane	199	“ I spent the past six months working with the park developers to come up with a renovation plan that would stand out above the rest . Creators spent countless hours developing new ride ideas , land concepts , float additions , and more . I had every intention of showing those designs today — in fact , I created a whole presentation centered around expanding Dreamland . ”
117346	117380	117381	117381	He	199	“ Over the last month , I spent time breaking down my grandfather ’s words . I came to the realization that finding weaknesses means more than increasing revenue or allocating funds better . ”
117429	117498	117499	117499	He	1947	“ During my grandfather ’s time in a coma , the weaknesses slowly became overlooked because of our strengths . The more Dreamland grew , the easier it was to ignore the smaller issues because more money meant more success . My grandfather wrote how there was a special person who helped him realize his mistakes , and I was fortunate enough to have met the same individual . ”
117535	117594	117521	117521	his	63	“ This person showed me how money becomes meaningless when we ignore the very people who help us make a profit . They were vocal about the issues with Dreamland , and I was intrigued by these so - called weaknesses . I began interviewing employees at random from all departments , and what I found was shocking . ”
117604	117731	117602	117602	Ralph	60	“ This is Ralph . He ’s been a dedicated ride mechanic at Dreamland for the past fifty years , making him our oldest employee besides my grandfather . When I asked him how he felt about all the Dreamland wage changes and insurance benefit cuts , he told me it did n’t matter . Of course , I thought that was a bizarre statement . Out of the two hundred employees I interviewed , Ralph was the only person who said it did n’t matter . So , naturally , I asked him why that was . And he told me that he recently found out he has stage four pancreatic cancer and his health insurance could n’t cover the kind of treatment he needs . ”
117805	117835	117836	117836	He	60	“ Ralph is one of our oldest employees at The Kane Company , and our — my — selfish business practices are limiting him from receiving proper cancer treatment . ”
117851	117898	117836	117836	He	60	“ There are hundreds of similar stories , from people struggling to work two jobs to employees being unable to afford appropriate health care procedures because of limited finances . No person should have to choose between supporting their family or putting their medical needs first . ”
117906	117971	117899	117899	He	60	“ As the Director of Dreamland , I want to protect people like Ralph . Because in the end , our employees are our biggest strength . Without them , there would be no Dreamland worthy of the success we have accrued . Therefore , I am suggesting the minimum wage is raised to meet standards consistent with what we expect from our employees . ”
117972	117981	117982	117983	Seth Kane	53	“ And what hourly wage do you suggest ? ”
118007	118017	117899	117899	He	60	“ A fifty percent raise at the very least . ”
118018	118037	117982	117983	Seth Kane	53	“ That is an extreme increase , given the fact that you voted against the previous wage change . ”
118134	118181	118127	118127	He	53	“ Based on research conducted , higher wages are associated with increased profitability . Top corporations have already made this pledge based on data - driven facts . If we increase wages , we boost efficiency , thus enhancing the overall Dreamland experience for our guests . ”
118187	118206	118182	118183	His father	1016	“ Why would we need to work on employee satisfaction if we are performing beyond expected each quarter ? ”
118223	118304	118207	118207	Rowan	256	“ When I surveyed over one million guests during my time here , over seventy - two percent of them said Dreamland employees played a key role in their overall experience . On a different question where they were asked what differentiated the Dreamland experience from competing theme parks , sixty - eight percent of guests chose the cast member experience . That means regardless of what rides we have , the employees are the ones who make the difference . ”
118358	118431	118432	118432	Rowan	256	“ On the flip side , over fifty percent of our employees said they would seek a job elsewhere in the next five years if Dreamland wages remained the same . Employee ’s reasons for quitting included an interest in saving up for retirement , a need for affording childcare , a desire to save for their children ’s college funds , and an interest in receiving better benefits , including healthcare . ”
118526	118593	118519	118519	My	199	“ By not increasing our wages nor improving our company benefits , we are single - handedly giving up our best asset . Our employees are the hidden reason why we stand apart from our competitors , and it ’s time we treated them as such . Therefore , I stand by my choice to increase wages and reinstate benefits to preserve the future of Dreamland . ”
118605	118655	118598	118598	Martha	57	“ In the past , you ’ve mentioned only being interested in temporarily serving as the Director . What happens if we approve these plans and you change your mind again in a year , given the fact that you were the one to introduce cut wages and benefits ? ”
118690	118728	118685	118685	Rowan	256	“ Another good question . The employees of Dreamland will be my utmost priority , given the fact that I plan on remaining here , serving as the Director for as long as they ’ll have me . ”
118770	118781	118760	118768	The man next to Rowan ’s father speaks up	1955	“ Are you no longer interested in becoming the CFO ? ”
118782	118785	118798	118798	Rowan	256	“ No . ”
118806	118830	118798	118798	Rowan	256	“ Why should I vote yes and approve your plans when I can vote no and take your twenty - five billion dollars ? ”
118831	118838	118839	118839	I	199	“ Twenty - five billion dollars ? ”
118861	118868	118851	118851	Martha	57	“ Here . Have some water . ”
118924	119013	119014	119014	He	1957	“ The main reason I am interested in receiving my shares is because I want to retain enough power to make the best choices for my employees . Dreamland makes up twenty percent of our entire company ’s revenue . I can be the kind of Director who works to push us to new limits while protecting our employees . I want to be the one . As I said earlier , I have created countless plans with the Creators that include expanding Dreamland beyond our one park . ”
119023	119068	119014	119014	He	1957	“ I have the slides ready to present if you need further evidence to support your decision to approve of my change . While I am interested in renovating the park beyond anything Dreamland has seen before , my first priority is the employees . ”
119104	119112	119097	119097	Rowan	256	“ That wo n’t sway my decision . ”
119208	119217	119202	119202	Martha	57	“ I would like some clarification on something . ”
119226	119229	119221	119221	Rowan	256	“ Yes ? ”
119230	119244	119202	119202	Martha	57	“ I am interested in hearing about your plans for employees with disabilities . ”
119271	119280	119281	119281	I	199	“ I thought you were on his side ? ”
119290	119294	119295	119295	She	57	“ I am . ”
119298	119309	119295	119295	She	57	“ There ’s one thing left he has n’t covered . ”
119372	119427	119364	119364	her	1964	“ This is Ani . She ’s one of our youngest employees who happens to come from a family of Dreamland workers . I happened to be partnered with her for a pilot mentorship program . She quickly schooled me in all things Dreamland , including our lack of diversity in the hiring process . ”
119480	119613	119463	119463	I	199	“ I was confused because I know our procedures and how we strive for an ethnically diverse cast . But then Ani told me how there are n’t people like her — people with disabilities , both visible and invisible . So , during my time I was supposed to be mentoring Ani , it turns out she mentored me . She taught me what it meant to live a life like hers , and I started doing my own research . So , to answer your question , Martha , I plan on expanding our hiring process to include more people with disabilities . I would also like to move forward with a full mentorship program to meet their demands . I want Dreamland to be the first of its kind . ”
119657	119761	119762	119762	I	199	“ This project will be addressed in three major phases , starting with the new mentorship program . Once that is complete , I will move forward with a Creator project that will emphasize Dreamland ’s promise for inclusivity . We will be expanding our costumes and souvenirs to include wheelchair , crutch , and prosthetics accessories to account for the population of children at Dreamland who are often ignored . Additionally , we will emphasize a new promise to families by creating the first - ever sensory celebration . This opportunity will give children on the spectrum the ability to enjoy Dreamland . ”
119832	119837	119838	119838	Rowan	256	“ Any other questions ? ”
119860	119868	119869	119869	He	256	“ Thank you for your time today . ”
120108	120112	120113	120113	I	199	“ Mr. Kane ? ”
120119	120122	120123	120123	He	53	“ Yes ? ”
120153	120225	120133	120133	Ugh	134	“ I wanted to say that although you might be considered a good businessman , you ’ve done it at the expense of being a terrible , verbally abusive father . And one day you ’re going to look back on your life and regret the way you treated your children , and I hope it hurts you as much as you hurt them . So fuck you and fuck off . ”
120582	120592	120573	120573	Martha	57	“ Your father would like a word with you . ”
120593	120598	120573	120573	Martha	57	“ Let him in . ”
120614	120619	120573	120573	Martha	57	“ Have a seat . ”
120624	120633	120620	120620	He	212	“ I do n’t plan on staying long . ”
120639	120644	120634	120634	I	199	“ Here to gloat ? ”
120650	120665	120645	120645	He	212	“ No . I want to tell you that I ’m proud of you . ”
120700	120703	120686	120686	I	199	“ Why ? ”
120708	120746	120704	120704	He	212	“ I wish you the best of luck running this place . I ’ll expect you at the next board meeting , ready to deliver a more concise presentation regarding your budget plan for all of this . ”
120766	120772	120748	120748	I	199	“ What are you saying ? ”
120773	120787	120748	120748	I	199	“ Your grandfather would have been proud of the man you ’ve become . ”
121169	121172	121173	121173	Zahra	256	“ So … ”
121184	121380	121173	121173	Zahra	256	“ When my grandfather sent me here as part of his will , I never thought I would meet someone as special as you . It was supposed to be a simple project . But I should have known things would n’t go according to plan the moment you fell into my lap — quite literally . It ’s like life kept throwing you in my way time and time again hoping I would get the memo . I was too stubborn to realize that you were always meant to be mine , Zahra . And because of that , I made mistakes . I lied about who I was . I refused to trust you even though I knew deep down I could . And most of all , I pushed you away when you did nothing but open your heart up to me without any reciprocation . I took your love for granted when I should have cherished it . Because to be loved by you is a gift . One that I threw away because I was too stupid and selfish to give you that kind of power over me in return . ”
121397	121470	121389	121389	she	1998	“ You were right when you said you deserve better . You always have and you always will . But I refuse to let you go . I ca n’t let you go because you ’re the one person in this entire world who makes me want to smile , and I ’m too damn selfish to let the best thing in my life get away from me because I ’m afraid . ”
121493	121583	121486	121486	I	199	“ Truth is , I ’m terrified of falling in love . But I ’d rather trust you with my heart and risk you breaking it than live another day without you in my life . I want to be the kind of man that deserves a woman as beautiful , selfless , and kind as you . It might take my entire life to achieve that kind of goal , but as long as you ’re by my side , I ’d consider it a life worth living . ”
121596	121622	121486	121486	I	199	“ And while I know I do n’t deserve you , I ’ll spend every single day proving to you how much I love you . ”
121640	121648	121693	121693	I	199	“ What about moving back to Chicago ? ”
121649	121671	121693	121693	I	199	“ Fuck Chicago . There ’s nothing I want more than to stay here with you and build a life together . ”
121672	121679	121680	121680	Her	1998	“ A kiss for a secret ? ”
121746	121781	121738	121738	She	1998	“ I love you too , Rowan . And I would be more than happy to protect your heart from the world because you make me want to be a little bit selfish too . ”
121944	121958	121959	121959	His	256	“ I love the little noises you make because they ’re all mine . ”
121989	122003	122004	122004	He	256	“ But I especially love the moans you make when I do this . ”
122038	122076	122077	122077	His	256	“ I thought I knew what it meant to be selfish , but then I met you . I want to own you in every way that matters . Your time . Your smiles . Your heart . ”
122172	122177	122160	122160	His	256	“ Eyes on me . ”
122242	122248	122231	122231	He	256	“ What did I say ? ”
122444	122454	122435	122435	Rowan	256	“ I love you so damn much , Zahra . ”
122474	122486	122435	122435	Rowan	256	“ Would you be willing to try something new with me ? ”
122523	122529	122514	122514	He	256	“ Do you trust me ? ”
122590	122596	122572	122572	His	256	“ Yes . I do . ”
122597	122611	122572	122572	His	256	“ Good . I do n’t want to use a condom with you . ”
122612	122619	122620	122620	I	199	“ I ’m sorry . What ? ”
122656	122667	122651	122651	He	256	“ I do n’t want anything else between us anymore . ”
122818	122832	122809	122809	Rowan	256	“ Now that I have you , I ’ll never let you go . ”
122847	122855	122839	122839	I	199	“ I do n’t want you to . ”
122856	122868	122869	122869	He	256	“ It ’s cute that you think you have a choice . ”
122947	122974	122975	122975	His	256	“ I ’m not sure what I did right in my life to deserve your love , but I ’ll stop at nothing to protect it . ”
122985	123016	123017	123017	He	256	“ I ’ll work every damn day to make sure you always have a reason to smile , even if it means sharing them with the rest of the world . ”
123033	123044	123017	123017	He	256	“ And I ’ll ruin anyone who threatens your happiness . ”
123110	123128	123096	123096	I	199	“ So , I might have said something uncharacteristically mean to your father after your presentation today . ”
123129	123158	123180	123180	Rowan	256	“ While my father is the last person I want to speak about while naked in bed with you , I ’m too curious to pass this up . ”
123167	123179	123159	123159	I	199	“ Well , I might have told him to fuck off . ”
123216	123231	123232	123232	He	256	“ You ’ve got to tell me this whole story from beginning to end . ”
123235	123257	123232	123232	He	256	“ There ’s not much to say . Martha bore witness to me telling him off for being a lousy father . ”
123258	123265	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ You said this in public ? ”
123266	123269	123232	123232	He	256	“ Yes ? ”
123281	123288	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ And what did he say ? ”
123289	123292	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ Nothing . ”
123296	123317	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ You told my father how much he sucked as a parent and to fuck off and he said nothing ? ”
123318	123326	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ Umm … was he supposed to ? ”
123327	123342	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ I ’ve heard him fire employees for breathing on him the wrong way . ”
123343	123350	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ That seems a bit extreme . ”
123351	123361	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ You do n’t know him like I do . ”
123362	123378	123293	123293	Rowan	256	“ Thank God . It ’s those small blessings that get me through the day . ”
123386	123411	123379	123379	His	256	“ I do n’t even know what to make of this . My father would never stand for that kind of talk from anyone . ”
123433	123441	123425	123425	I	199	“ Maybe he already knew I quit . ”
123447	123474	123442	123442	Rowan	256	“ I doubt that . I did n’t let Jenny file your notice , so you ’re still considered an employee in every way that counts . ”
123475	123479	123480	123480	I	199	“ WHAT ? ! ”
123496	123504	123484	123484	Rowan	256	“ I could n’t let you go . ”
123505	123527	123484	123484	Rowan	256	“ Yeah , well , you ca n’t hold my notice hostage because you felt like it . That ’s illegal . ”
123531	123561	123528	123528	He	256	“ According to your contract , I can do exactly that until you complete an exit interview with me . That ’s why you always check the fine print . ”
123567	123579	123528	123528	He	256	“ I thought I was n’t special enough for fine print . ”
123580	123606	123623	123623	He	256	“ You ’re so damn special to me that I do n’t plan on letting anyone in your vicinity who is n’t family or female . ”
123612	123622	123607	123607	I	199	“ You ’re too possessive for your own good . ”
123648	123657	123628	123628	he	256	“ How does this conversation turn you on ? ”
123674	123688	123689	123689	Rowan	256	“ Because why talk about being possessive when I can show you instead . ”
123774	123779	123763	123763	Rowan	256	“ Are you ready ? ”
123899	123916	123889	123889	I	199	“ I ca n’t believe this is happening . Do you think people will like it ? ”
123917	123925	123926	123926	Rowan	256	“ They ’d be crazy not to . ”
123934	123944	123926	123926	Rowan	256	“ You trust me with a weapon like this ? ”
123963	123972	123973	123973	He	256	“ Okay , maybe not my best idea . ”
123987	123998	123999	123999	He	256	“ Those are heavier than they look in the movies . ”
124017	124025	124026	124026	I	199	“ They caught you smiling on camera ! ”
124032	124048	124026	124026	I	199	“ How much do you think I need to pay him to delete the image ? ”
124049	124062	124098	124098	Cal	46	“ I ’m not sure . Everything saves to a cloud now — ”
124063	124081	124082	124082	Ani	2278	“ Are you both going to get this moving ? I want to go on the rides ! ”
124092	124097	124098	124098	Cal	46	“ What she said ! ”
124107	124114	124115	124115	Rowan	256	“ We ’re having a moment , ”
124122	124145	124146	124146	Cal	46	“ We ’ve all had to live through three years of your moments already . I ’ve heard some of them too , ”
124150	124159	124160	124160	I	199	“ Hello ! My parents are right there . ”
124165	124170	124171	124171	Rowan	256	“ They ’re jealous , ”
124184	124193	124194	124194	Ani	2278	“ Not really . You both are gross . ”
124234	124239	124240	124240	She	2278	“ I made it ! ”
124256	124259	124260	124260	Rowan	256	“ Finally , ”
124266	124276	124281	124281	Zahra	420	“ You were stalling for Claire to make it ? ”
124283	124303	124304	124304	Rowan	256	“ Of course . Without her , you might have never submitted that drunk proposal in the first place . ”
124333	124342	124319	124319	Zahra	256	“ Thank you for always being so thoughtful . ”
124343	124354	124355	124355	He	256	“ I made you a promise , did n’t I ? ”
124413	124416	124402	124402	I	199	“ Ready ? ”
124429	124436	124437	124437	His	2341	“ Take it away , wife . ”
124498	124664	124491	124491	I	199	“ Thank you for joining us today . Nebula Land holds a special place in all of our hearts because we know how much it would have meant to Brady . While he ca n’t be here today , I ’m sure he ’s looking down at us , just as excited as we are . Iggy was his favorite character , although he might not have admitted it in so many words . Brady cherished his first drawing because it represented him , a young immigrant who felt like he traveled to a completely different world when he came to America . Iggy became a way for Brady to channel his happiness , excitement , and fears . In itself , Iggy is an extension of Brady in many ways — of the values Brady wants to spread with his movies . So we are thrilled to open Nebula Land up for all of Dreamland to visit and love as much as we do . ”
124706	124710	124697	124697	Someone	2058	“ You did — ”
124812	124825	124795	124795	He	256	“ I ’m proud of you . That was an amazing speech . ”
124826	124849	124850	124850	I	199	“ Just amazing ? I can do better than that . Let ’s call the reporters back here and have a redo . ”
124863	124872	124795	124795	He	256	“ You ’re crazy , you know that ? ”
124873	124885	124850	124850	I	199	“ Hard to forget when you tell me every single day . ”
124894	124902	124886	124886	He	256	“ I do love to be consistent . ”
124928	124933	124920	124920	He	256	“ What is that ? ”
124934	124937	124938	124938	I	199	“ What ? ”
124942	124948	124949	124949	He	256	“ Whose pin is that ? ”
125035	125038	125039	125039	I	199	“ Mine . ”
125055	125060	125042	125042	He	256	“ You ’re pregnant ? ”
125147	125178	125136	125136	He	256	“ You ’re the best damn thing that ever happened to me . Thank you for giving me the chance to be the dad I never had but always wanted . ”
