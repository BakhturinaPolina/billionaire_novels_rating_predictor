7	22	23	23	Cal	720	“ It ’s a crime to celebrate a day like today all by yourself , ”
71	80	81	81	His	720	“ I ’m not the one getting married . ”
88	102	81	81	His	720	“ No , but you ’re the puppet master who accomplished the impossible . ”
103	110	131	131	His	720	“ It was n’t that bad . ”
111	130	131	131	His	720	“ Now I know something is wrong with you . Are you … sad Declan is getting married ? ”
145	150	131	131	His	720	“ What ? No . ”
151	157	158	158	My	0	“ Then what ’s wrong ? ”
209	224	201	201	me	0	“ I just got an email telling me I did n’t get the job . ”
225	246	201	201	me	0	“ Shit . I ’m sorry to hear that . I know how hard you worked on the interview presentation . ”
348	358	344	344	My	0	“ I guess it was n’t meant to be . ”
359	369	370	370	I	0	“ That ’s some bullshit if you ask me . ”
373	412	370	370	I	0	“ It ’s true . At least Declan never found out . Could you imagine if I told him and then I did n’t even get the job ? He would ’ve never let me live it down . ”
413	420	344	344	My	0	“ He does tend to gloat . ”
421	426	427	427	I	0	“ Hence the party . ”
452	460	461	461	I	0	“ Understated . He ’ll love it . ”
469	492	461	461	I	0	“ I simply planned a party like he asked me to . He should have specified what kind of event he wanted . ”
493	502	439	439	Cal	720	“ Remind me to never piss you off . ”
503	515	516	516	Cal	720	“ I have a whole plan for the day that happens . ”
520	530	516	516	Cal	720	“ Where is the wife - to - be ? ”
531	542	543	543	His	720	“ Declan wanted to meet with her before the announcement . ”
547	558	543	543	His	720	“ Why the hell would you let him do that ? ”
559	570	584	584	Cal	720	“ Umm … because he has n’t met her yet ? ”
571	583	584	584	Cal	720	“ Exactly ! That ’s why it ’s a terrible idea ! ”
593	606	584	584	Cal	720	“ You think he ’s going to make her change her mind ? ”
607	619	584	584	Cal	720	“ Knowing my brother , it would n’t take much convincing . ”
620	632	584	584	Cal	720	“ She signed a contract . It ’s a done deal . ”
633	639	640	640	He	720	“ If you say so … ”
643	652	653	653	I	0	“ Maybe I should go check on them . ”
666	676	659	659	Cal	720	“ No . You ’re taking the night off . ”
677	680	659	659	Cal	720	“ But — ”
681	708	659	659	Cal	720	“ You ’re probably right . Declan would n’t risk losing it all now by doing something stupid . Even he knows when to hold back . ”
709	717	718	718	He	720	“ Now I know you ’re lying . ”
721	773	774	774	He	720	“ Come on . Let ’s go inside and wait for Declan . Just think about the way he will try so hard not to scowl and fail anyway . Hell , I do n’t think I ’ve seen him so much as look in someone ’s direction without sneering since — ”
779	782	783	783	He	720	“ Since ? ”
791	810	811	811	I	0	“ Since forever . I ’m pretty sure his dick is permanently chafed from jacking off every night . ”
819	828	811	811	I	0	“ Shut up ! He ’s my boss . ”
829	853	854	854	I	0	“ Does n’t make it any less true . I ’m surprised said appendage has n’t fallen off from that kind of abuse . ”
860	863	864	864	Declan	402	“ Callahan . ”
885	895	896	896	Cal	720	“ He sure knows how to clear a room , ”
1206	1224	1225	1225	Declan	402	“ Declan , what are you doing out here ? Is it time for the announcement already ? ”
1262	1266	1267	1267	I	0	“ She quit . ”
1270	1278	1267	1267	I	0	“ Who quit ? The wedding planner ? ”
1279	1287	1300	1300	Declan	402	“ No . The wife . Belinda . ”
1288	1293	1294	1294	Cal	720	“ Bethany quit ? ! ”
1318	1323	1310	1310	he	402	“ Yes . Her . ”
1324	1331	1332	1332	I	0	“ This ca n’t be happening . ”
1380	1394	1395	1395	Cal	720	“ I hate to be the one to say I told you so … ”
1398	1405	1395	1395	Cal	720	“ This is all your fault . ”
1422	1440	1411	1411	Cal	720	“ No ! It ’s not my fault my brother ’s attitude is bigger than his dick . ”
1465	1476	1477	1477	Cal	720	“ You should have eloped while you had the chance . ”
1489	1495	1496	1496	Cal	720	“ Speaking from personal experience ? ”
1529	1583	1522	1522	He	720	“ That is why my grandpa made that inheritance clause in the first place . He knew Declan was n’t ready to become CEO and thought a family might soften him up . I mean , how can someone like him inspire the masses when he always seeks to destroy everyone around him ? ”
1603	1624	1598	1598	I	0	“ Quit acting like a child and use that big brain of yours to help us out of this mess . ”
1639	1667	1668	1668	He	720	“ And you stop taking your anger out on everyone else . Your screwing up has nothing to do with Cal and everything to do with you . ”
1686	1712	1683	1683	Cal	720	“ Of course he fucked this up . His latest software update did n’t include a manual on how to be a decent human being . ”
1713	1719	1720	1720	I	0	“ You ’re both hopeless , ”
1758	1761	1745	1745	I	0	“ Shit ! ”
1762	1766	1767	1767	Cal	720	“ No answer ? ”
1775	1781	1767	1767	Cal	720	“ What did you do ? ”
1815	1825	1789	1789	Declan	402	“ She was n’t cut out for the job . ”
1826	1863	1864	1864	He	402	“ And what would you like me to do with that information given the fact that we have a hundred people waiting to hear about your engagement to some mystery woman ? I ’m all ears . ”
1901	1928	1886	1886	Cal	720	“ I ’m also interested in hearing how this will all pan out . Father will be just thrilled to hear about Declan ’s failed engagement . ”
2052	2063	2044	2044	Cal	720	“ That ’s the sound of Declan ’s future dying . ”
2064	2078	2079	2079	Declan	402	“ Do n’t you have somewhere to be ? A seedy bar perhaps ? ”
2082	2098	2099	2099	Cal	720	“ Why pay for alcohol when I can get it for free on your dime ? ”
2171	2179	2180	2180	Cal	720	“ You know , Iris is single . ”
2186	2205	2180	2180	Cal	720	“ She could step into the role like a natural since no one knows you better than her . ”
2206	2209	2210	2210	Declan	402	“ No , ”
2299	2318	2294	2294	Declan	402	“ There you are ! I was wondering where the husband - to - be snuck off to . ”
2327	2338	2339	2339	Cal	720	“ You ca n’t pay for this kind of entertainment . ”
2352	2364	2339	2339	Cal	720	“ Where is the fiancée I ’ve heard so little about ? ”
2431	2434	2425	2425	Declan	402	“ Beatr — ”
2435	2443	2444	2444	I	0	“ Her name is Tati , dear . ”
2494	2500	2477	2477	he	720	“ What are you doing ? ”
2516	2531	2501	2501	His	720	“ Saving you the trouble of having to introduce me and explain our story . ”
2713	2730	2731	2731	Her	236	“ Tati , I was n’t fully honest with you when we spoke over the phone . ”
2735	2738	2731	2731	Her	236	“ Oh . ”
2739	2783	2784	2784	She	236	“ I was a bit hesitant about introducing myself as anything but Declan ’s assistant before meeting you in person . See , I ’ve been working at the Kane Company for quite some time , and you know how easily gossip spreads . ”
2797	2805	2784	2784	She	236	“ Of course . I get it . ”
2806	2838	2839	2839	My	0	“ I was so scared of what people would think about me dating my boss , but we ca n’t hide it anymore . We do n’t want to hide it . ”
2909	2932	2933	2933	Cal	720	“ We ’re ready to move forward with our future . There ’s no reason to keep our love a secret anymore . ”
2974	2993	2968	2968	she	46	“ Wow ! Tonight must be such a big deal for you both then , for multiple reasons . ”
3003	3011	2994	2994	Her	46	“ Oh , right . The ring ! ”
3152	3188	3137	3137	Tati	46	“ I asked Declan to hold on to it since we need to get it resized . The damn thing flew off my finger the moment I threw myself into his arms after he proposed . ”
3189	3193	3194	3194	Tati	46	“ Oh no ! ”
3204	3236	3197	3197	Cal	720	“ I told my brother it was a bad idea to propose in the middle of a rainstorm , but he insisted it was the perfect moment because Iris loves them . ”
3237	3252	3253	3253	I	0	“ I ’ve never seen anyone get down on their knees quicker than him . ”
3275	3318	3319	3319	Cal	720	“ The man nearly tore his Tom Ford slacks in half while chasing after that ring . My brother has never panicked like that before , so it ’s a good thing he found it before it fell down a storm drain . ”
3335	3354	3329	3329	Declan	402	“ Did you get all this on video ? I ’d love to show it to the guests ! ”
3365	3383	3384	3384	I	0	“ Oh no . Declan ’s proposal was spur of the moment . It was so romantic — ”
3414	3424	3402	3402	He	720	“ Oh , look ! It fits after all ! ”
3445	3462	3432	3432	she	46	“ He must have found some time in his busy schedule to finally have it resized . ”
3516	3523	3507	3507	I	0	“ I think it ’s stuck . ”
3542	3549	3550	3550	his	402	“ In more ways than one , ”
3595	3604	3590	3590	He	402	“ Time to get on with this show . ”
3739	3753	3738	3738	DECLAN	402	“ I ’d like a moment to speak with my fiancée in private . ”
3825	3831	3832	3832	He	720	“ See you both inside . ”
3855	3875	3876	3876	She	36	“ I ’ll be back in five minutes to grab you two . Do n’t disappear on me again . ”
3990	3998	3999	3999	Iris	36	“ What the hell were you thinking ? ”
4018	4029	4011	4011	her	36	“ I ’m saving your ass , that ’s what . ”
4030	4042	4064	4064	Her	36	“ I ’m failing to see how that ’s the case . ”
4043	4063	4064	4064	Her	36	“ Would you like me to schedule you an eye exam ? I hear vision gets worse with age . ”
4084	4090	4078	4078	My	0	“ Do n’t test me . ”
4091	4103	4104	4104	She	36	“ And do n’t you dare look at me that way . ”
4135	4182	4120	4120	her	36	“ If I did n’t step in then you would have had to explain to a room full of a hundred guests why there ’s no blushing bride - to - be . What would you tell everyone ? That she got lost in the mail ? ”
4183	4186	4187	4187	I	0	“ No . ”
4193	4209	4210	4210	Her	36	“ Although a mail - order bride seems like a better alternative at the moment . ”
4217	4230	4210	4210	Her	36	“ Face it . You ’ve run out of time and options . ”
4231	4234	4235	4235	I	0	“ Clearly . ”
4269	4278	4252	4252	She	36	“ Way to make a girl feel special . ”
4279	4292	4303	4303	She	36	“ Special is the last word I would use to describe you . ”
4317	4331	4303	4303	She	36	“ I do n’t know why I thought this was a good idea . ”
4332	4346	4309	4309	she	36	“ That makes two of us . What exactly is your motive here ? ”
4347	4385	4386	4386	I	0	“ I like you enough to want to save you from yourself . I ’m sure it must be a chemical imbalance of some kind , so my therapist will be hearing all about this on Monday . ”
4391	4408	4409	4409	Her	36	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re marrying me out of the goodness of your heart ? ”
4420	4427	4416	4416	she	36	“ So what if I am ? ”
4428	4441	4442	4442	Her	36	“ Cut the act . Those ideas only exist in Dreamland films . ”
4446	4461	4442	4442	Her	36	“ I ’m not acting , although your reaction makes me wish I was . ”
4591	4606	4586	4586	My	0	“ Are you doing all this because you ’re secretly in love with me ? ”
4878	4887	4867	4867	I	0	“ Are you experiencing a kind of crisis ? ”
4888	4903	4904	4904	She	36	“ No , you fool . And I ’m not in love with you . ”
4921	4931	4918	4918	she	36	“ I ’m doing this because we ’re friends . ”
4932	4940	4942	4942	I	0	“ I will never be your friend . ”
4955	4966	4948	4948	Her	36	“ Liar . Friends help friends when they ’re sick . ”
4967	4978	4918	4918	she	36	“ I have no idea what you ’re talking about . ”
4979	4988	4989	4989	I	0	“ Remember the time I had the flu ? ”
4994	5006	4989	4989	I	0	“ I ’m still not entirely convinced that was the case . ”
5007	5013	5014	5014	Her	36	“ So you do remember ! ”
5022	5046	5014	5014	Her	36	“ Only because I had to hire a clean - up crew to ensure every square inch of the place was scrubbed down . ”
5047	5066	4989	4989	I	0	“ Fine . What about the time I helped you when you got drunk on a business trip ? ”
5067	5074	5014	5014	Her	36	“ I never wanted your assistance . ”
5075	5098	5099	5099	My	0	“ You were tripping over your own feet and asking me to introduce you to my twin you did n’t know about . ”
5115	5137	5099	5099	My	0	“ Drunk you is so much nicer . You asked me to tuck you into bed and sing you a lullaby . ”
5138	5156	5157	5157	My	0	“ Now I know you ’re lying . You ’re one of the worst singers I know . ”
5182	5207	5174	5174	She	262	“ Okay , fine . I lied . But I would n’t have said no if you asked ! Because friends help other friends . ”
5282	5290	5291	5291	She	262	“ Fix that god - awful sound . ”
5301	5309	5291	5291	She	262	“ Concerned about my well - being ? ”
5310	5319	5291	5291	She	262	“ Solely for a self - serving purpose . ”
5320	5329	5330	5330	She	262	“ Of course . How could I forget . ”
5344	5353	5330	5330	She	262	“ Let ’s get a few things straight . ”
5369	5422	5365	5365	I	0	“ Any kindness I showed to you in the past is strictly out of respect for you as my assistant . I do n’t waste my time on something as pointless as friendship , so if you believe there was anything platonic between us , that falls on you , not me . ”
5439	5466	5432	5432	Iris	36	“ Silly me for believing you actually could possess any feelings besides disdain toward anyone else . I can assure you it wo n’t happen again . ”
5467	5483	5484	5484	She	36	“ I do n’t feel anything besides a burning desire to achieve my end goal . ”
5487	5498	5499	5499	I	0	“ There ’s more to life than destroying your father . ”
5516	5526	5503	5503	I	0	“ I need to set some ground rules now . ”
5527	5530	5531	5531	Her	36	“ Rules . ”
5538	5542	5531	5531	Her	36	“ Every look . ”
5586	5590	5591	5591	Her	36	“ Every touch . ”
5645	5656	5631	5631	I	0	“ Every single kiss … is nothing but a lie . ”
5718	5725	5726	5726	Her	36	“ You — I — wha — ”
5806	5832	5833	5833	Her	36	“ There is nothing I wo n’t do to earn my inheritance . Remember that when you forget this is only a game to me . ”
5852	5871	5838	5838	she	36	“ All right , you two . The guests are getting antsy to meet the future Mr. and Mrs. ”
5893	5898	5899	5899	Iris	36	“ Are you ready ? ”
5941	5957	5940	5940	IRIS	36	“ Everyone , please put your hands together for the future Mr. and Mrs. Kane . ”
6099	6103	6104	6104	He	402	“ Deep breath . ”
6157	6171	6149	6149	he	402	“ Iris and I are getting married at the end of the month . ”
6277	6280	6281	6281	I	0	“ Surprise ! ”
6333	6341	6342	6342	Rowan	715	“ Welcome to the family , Iris . ”
6406	6419	6393	6393	Cal	720	“ Family therapy is on Thursday nights . Do n’t be late ! ”
6437	6445	6446	6446	Declan	402	“ One hour and we ’re leaving , ”
6460	6474	6475	6475	He	402	“ I was going to suggest thirty minutes , but if you insist . ”
6675	6678	6666	6666	his	2021	“ Relax . ”
6712	6715	6716	6716	Seth	2021	“ Son . ”
6745	6748	6749	6749	Declan	402	“ Father . ”
6807	6816	6797	6797	him	2021	“ I figure some congratulations are in order . ”
6836	6848	6831	6831	him	2021	“ My son is lucky to have you in his life . ”
6883	6891	6892	6892	Declan	402	“ Save your display for the cameras . ”
6945	6958	6959	6959	Declan	402	“ Fine advice from someone putting on quite the show right now . ”
6970	6990	6991	6991	He	402	“ Just because you ’re bitter about love does n’t mean the rest of us feel the same way . ”
6994	7005	6991	6991	He	402	“ You do n’t know the first thing about love . ”
7006	7024	7030	7030	Seth	2021	“ They say you can learn a lot from others ’ mistakes , so thanks for that . ”
7067	7095	7096	7096	Seth	2021	“ You know nothing about what your mother and I went through , and I hope you never have to experience something like that during your marriage . ”
7199	7207	7208	7208	Declan	402	“ Let ’s get this over with , ”
7214	7229	7230	7231	The man	2021	“ I never thought I ’d see the day when Declan Kane got engaged — ”
7406	7414	7396	7396	He	272	“ Do you know how to dance ? ”
7425	7434	7415	7415	I	0	“ Of course I know how to dance . ”
7565	7570	7571	7571	I	0	“ Stop doing that , ”
7578	7582	7571	7571	I	0	“ Doing what ? ”
7583	7589	7571	7571	I	0	“ Touching me like that . ”
7590	7596	7597	7597	he	402	“ You ’re my fiancée , ”
7642	7651	7618	7618	he	402	“ What kind of slow dancing is this ? ”
7652	7661	7662	7662	My	0	“ The kind that has everyone filming us . ”
7674	7678	7679	7679	His	0	“ Oh God . ”
7921	7936	7937	7937	Easier	57	“ You got this , Iris . Do n’t let them get to you . ”
8057	8065	8066	8066	Declan	402	“ How much is he paying you ? ”
8086	8099	8078	8078	I	0	“ I have no idea who or what you ’re talking about . ”
8100	8119	8120	8120	My	0	“ I ’m willing to pay you double whatever he offered to make this engagement cease to exist . ”
8124	8128	8120	8120	My	0	“ Excuse me ? ”

8177	8196	8197	8197	He	36	“ I ’m a lucky woman . Marrying your son is like a Dreamland story brought to life . ”
8208	8223	8197	8197	He	36	“ Do n’t flatter yourself . Declan is only marrying you for his inheritance . ”
8224	8229	8230	8230	I	0	“ He ’s what ? ”
8239	8245	8230	8230	I	0	“ You did n’t know . ”
8261	8276	8277	8277	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? He never mentioned anything about an inheritance . ”
8291	8320	8321	8321	I	0	“ The only reason he put a ring on your finger is because he wants my position . Without you , he has no chance at becoming CEO . ”
8325	8328	8329	8329	His	36	“ What ? ”
8338	8352	8329	8329	His	36	“ You ca n’t actually think he wants to marry you for love ? ”
8353	8362	8363	8363	My	0	“ If not love , then what for ? ”
8414	8436	8406	8406	Declan	402	“ What else ? An inheritance . Without a wife and a child , he has no way of becoming CEO . ”
8437	8449	8450	8450	My	0	“ Are you serious ? What is wrong with you people ? ”
8472	8475	8464	8464	He	720	“ Unfortunately . ”

8491	8500	8501	8501	I	0	“ How I found out does n’t matter . ”
8511	8534	8501	8501	I	0	“ Do you have proof ? You ca n’t believe I ’m dumb enough to take your word over my fiancé ’s ? ”
8570	8606	8607	8607	Boom	58	“ He and I had a discussion about all of this when he sought out my advice . I tried to warn him to not go through with this , but he did n’t listen . ”
8687	8699	8678	8678	I	0	“ Excuse me . I ’m just feeling so overwhelmed suddenly . ”
8744	8769	8770	8770	I	0	“ My son should know better than to play with an innocent woman ’s feelings . I thought I taught him better than that . ”
8808	8852	8853	8853	His	52	“ There ’s only one person playing with my feelings , and I ’m staring straight at him . Thanks for all the information though . I ’m sure Declan will be interested in hearing all about your attempt to ruin our engagement . ”
8866	8873	8853	8853	His	52	“ You think you ’re clever ? ”
8874	8882	8853	8853	His	52	“ Oh , I know I am . ”
8883	8906	8853	8853	His	52	“ I was trying to save you from a loveless marriage , but it seems as if you two deserve each other . ”
8907	8920	8853	8853	His	52	“ I sure hope so , seeing as we ’re getting married . ”
8921	8934	8853	8853	His	52	“ He will never love you . He is incapable of it . ”

8975	8981	8971	8971	His	52	“ This is n’t over . ”
8995	9012	8982	8982	I	0	“ I sure hope not . I thoroughly enjoy watching you make a fool of yourself . ”
9030	9035	9040	9040	I	0	“ Your father knows , ”

9080	9103	9104	9104	His	896	“ Let ’s just say he and I had a heart - to - heart after he cornered me near the bathroom . ”
9111	9119	9120	9120	I	0	“ Tell me exactly what he said . ”
9161	9167	9168	9168	I	0	“ He has no evidence . ”
9176	9189	9168	9168	I	0	“ Does n’t mean he wo n’t stop until he finds some . ”
9190	9203	9217	9217	His	896	“ Then we will give everyone a show they so desperately want . ”
9204	9216	9217	9217	His	896	“ But are n’t you worried he might do something irrational ? ”
9224	9250	9217	9217	His	896	“ I ’d like to see him try . There is nothing I ’d like more than to tear him down once and for all . ”
9258	9266	9217	9217	His	896	“ So what ’s our plan then ? ”
9267	9271	9272	9272	I	0	“ Our plan ? ”

9313	9333	9293	9293	his	896	“ If Cal ’s stories are anything to go off of , I think I have a good idea . ”
9334	9349	9350	9350	My	0	“ Whatever Cal told you is a watered - down version of the truth . ”

9389	9416	9384	9384	I	0	“ Well , then . While I appreciate your concern , your father does n’t scare me , so your cautionary tales are a wasted effort . ”
9417	9434	9435	9435	I	0	“ You must have a death wish . There ’s no explanation for your irrational behavior . ”
9438	9452	9454	9454	IRIS	36	“ Obviously , or else I would have never agreed to marry you . ”
9455	9461	9454	9454	IRIS	36	“ You ’re what ? ! ”
9485	9492	9493	9493	Nana	62	“ She said she ’s engaged , ”
9520	9539	9508	9508	she	62	“ How ? Where ? To whom ? Last time I checked , you said you were single ! ”
9550	9555	9508	9508	she	62	“ It ’s complicated . ”
9587	9627	9628	9628	Nana	62	“ Well do n’t leave us waiting here . I do n’t know how long I ’ll have on this earth , and with the way you ’re stammering , you ’ll be hosting a funeral before a wedding , ”
9660	9672	9635	9635	She	453	“ There ’s not much to plan since I ’m eloping . ”
9673	9678	9679	9679	Mom	453	“ Excuse me ? ! ”
9688	9719	9679	9679	Mom	453	“ No , you are not . You ’re my one and only baby and I will not let you have some wedding in a back room of a courthouse . ”
9720	9735	9736	9736	Nana	62	“ What ’s wrong with that ? That ’s the way I got married . ”
9741	9748	9749	9749	Mom	453	“ Exactly my point , Mother , ”
9752	9778	9749	9749	Mom	453	“ The location was convenient . I took my newlywed ass to Bourbon Street , and your father and I made a night of it . ”
9779	9798	9799	9799	I	0	“ I ’m well aware of the day I was conceived . No need to rehash that story . ”
9816	9836	9799	9799	I	0	“ Do you both want to hear my story or are you more interested in scarring me for life ? ”

9978	9988	9968	9968	Mom	453	“ No . Not really , to be honest . ”
9993	9996	9997	9997	Grandma	65	“ What ? ”
10000	10019	9997	9997	Grandma	65	“ Oh , come on . You skipped Christmas last year to spend time with him in Tokyo . ”

10029	10053	10054	10054	I	0	“ Right . We all like to work , darling . Some more than others . And preferably more than once a day . ”

10291	10307	10308	10308	Nana	62	“ Is that supposed to be a bad thing because I only see the positives , ”
10318	10330	10331	10331	Mom	453	“ We ca n’t help who we fall in love with . ”
10334	10341	10331	10331	Mom	453	“ No . We ca n’t . ”
10385	10400	10377	10377	She	453	“ As long as you ’re happy , then I ’m happy for you . ”
10497	10508	10490	10490	Nana	62	“ So , when do we get to meet him ? ”
10525	10532	10533	10533	he	720	“ You ’ve been avoiding me , ”
10536	10550	10533	10533	he	720	“ More like I ’ve been dealing with the fallout of my actions . ”
10608	10615	10616	10616	I	0	“ Why did you do it ? ”
10631	10637	10616	10616	I	0	“ Because I ’m stupid . ”
10638	10665	10616	10616	I	0	“ How did you go from breaking up with every boyfriend you had before things got ‘ too real ’ to agreeing to marry my brother ? ”
10666	10683	10684	10684	He	720	“ When you put it that way , it does sound a bit out of character . ”
10687	10696	10684	10684	He	720	“ What happened to swearing off men forever ? ”
10697	10713	10616	10616	I	0	“ Well , forever does seem like a long time when you think about it … ”
10714	10736	10684	10684	He	720	“ Says the woman who thought an ex - boyfriend buying her a spare toothbrush was ‘ moving too fast . ’ ”
10737	10742	10684	10684	He	720	“ This is different . ”
10843	10873	10835	10835	Cal	720	“ Oh , it ’s different all right . You ’re getting married . And having a baby . As in you are going to make me an uncle . ”
10878	10885	10835	10835	Cal	720	“ I know it sounds crazy — ”
10886	10894	10895	10895	I	0	“ That ’s because it is crazy . ”
10901	10909	10895	10895	I	0	“ Then why did you encourage it ? ”
10910	10924	10925	10925	My	0	“ Because I did n’t think you would actually go through with it ! ”
10940	10953	10937	10937	He	720	“ My brother is the last kind of man you should marry . ”
10961	10964	10937	10937	He	720	“ Why ? ”
10965	10996	10895	10895	I	0	“ Because he will hurt you . It ’s second nature for him , and it ’s only a matter of time before you get caught up in the crosswinds . ”
10997	11028	10937	10937	He	720	“ It ’s sweet of you to worry , except our relationship is nothing but a contractual agreement . There wo n’t be an opportunity for him to hurt me . ”
11080	11089	11090	11090	I	0	“ You could fall in love with him . ”
11099	11121	11122	11122	Cal	720	“ Declan and I could be the last two people on Earth and I would still choose my vibrator over him . ”

11133	11138	11122	11122	Cal	720	“ It ’s true ! ”
11139	11151	11122	11122	Cal	720	“ Then how do you plan on having a child together ? ”
11152	11163	11122	11122	Cal	720	“ With the help of someone in a white coat . ”

11438	11450	11436	11436	her	36	“ I do n’t know what you would do without me . ”
11451	11462	11436	11436	her	36	“ Your inflated sense of self - worth is concerning . ”
11463	11476	11526	11526	she	36	“ You do n’t have to pretend to dislike me so much . ”
11477	11487	11488	11488	She	36	“ Your first mistake is thinking I ’m pretending . ”
11495	11508	11488	11488	She	36	“ They say there ’s a thin line between love and hate . ”
11509	11514	11515	11515	I	0	“ Not thin enough , ”
11532	11547	11526	11526	she	36	“ Initial at the bottom of each page once you ’re done reading it . ”

11592	11598	11599	11599	Her	36	“ Is that a problem ? ”
11611	11627	11599	11599	Her	36	“ No , but I ’ll need to spend my lunch break reading over it . ”
11628	11643	11659	11659	She	36	“ Take whatever time you need but that contract is n’t leaving this office . ”
11668	11707	11659	11659	She	36	“ Fine . But I plan on reviewing each page three times just to make sure you ’re not up to anything suspicious , so do n’t get annoyed because I ’m eating into your precious alone time . ”
11727	11749	11721	11721	she	36	“ Spare me the play - by - play and get on with it . I have other things to do . ”
11765	11785	11750	11750	I	0	“ If you pack on any more muscle , that thing is going to split in half one day . ”

11884	11890	11855	11855	Her	36	“ Is that a problem ? ”
11891	11898	11863	11863	Her	36	“ Yes ! A big problem ! ”
11899	11916	11917	11917	Her	36	“ I suppose now is the time I mention that the contract is non - negotiable . ”
11923	11929	11917	11917	Her	36	“ Then make it negotiable . ”
11930	11933	11855	11855	Her	36	“ No . ”
11934	11940	11941	11941	I	0	“ Then I ’ll walk . ”

12064	12075	12076	12076	She	36	“ Money is n’t the problem . Your decision is . ”
12099	12108	12109	12109	She	36	“ I ’ll give you two hundred million . ”
12148	12153	12154	12154	Her	36	“ Three hundred million . ”

12421	12426	12427	12427	She	36	“ Me ? Never . ”
12432	12439	12440	12440	Her	36	“ I prefer the term motivating . ”
12450	12459	12440	12440	Her	36	“ You ’re a pain in my ass . ”
12460	12474	12479	12479	her	36	“ Nope . That ’s just the same old stick acting up again . ”
12506	12514	12515	12515	Her	36	“ Go ahead and list your conditions . ”
12542	12576	12522	12522	she	36	“ I want shared custody — take it or leave it . You ’re going to be a parent for fifty percent of the time whether you think you want to or not . ”

12641	12655	12656	12656	Her	36	“ Next you ’re going to tell me that Earth is n’t flat . ”
12660	12670	12656	12656	Her	36	“ I hate when you try to be funny . ”
12671	12674	12522	12522	she	36	“ Why ? ”
12675	12685	12686	12686	Her	36	“ Because I like you better without a personality . ”

13053	13059	13040	13040	She	36	“ It ’s settled then — ”
13060	13064	13040	13040	She	36	“ But no . ”
13065	13071	13072	13072	Her	36	“ For fuck ’s sake . ”
13098	13116	13083	13083	She	36	“ I do n’t want to be stuck with all the boring stuff like homework and chores . ”
13117	13131	13132	13132	She	36	“ Then hire a housekeeper and a tutor . You can afford it . ”
13137	13172	13132	13132	She	36	“ That ’s not my point . We should switch off every other week so we can provide a more consistent and stable home . That way we can both be the fun parent . ”
13173	13191	13192	13192	She	36	“ I can assure you that I will never be described as the ‘ fun parent . ’ ”
13197	13235	13192	13192	She	36	“ Kids are simple . As long as you feed them , play with them , and memorize all their favorite cartoon characters by TV show , then you ’re instantly the coolest person in the room . ”
13236	13243	13132	13132	She	36	“ That sounds like absolute hell . ”
13244	13254	13255	13255	I	0	“ At least you ’ll feel right at home . ”
13263	13275	13255	13255	I	0	“ Fine . We will swap the child every other week . ”
13276	13289	13132	13132	She	36	“ See , I knew you could compromise if given the chance . ”
13290	13295	13296	13296	She	36	“ Blackmail works wonders . ”
13299	13312	13296	13296	She	36	“ You would know . It ’s your go - to tactic . ”
13380	13385	13375	13375	She	36	“ One more thing . ”
13398	13407	13375	13375	She	36	“ My mother wants a traditional church wedding . ”
13408	13411	13375	13375	She	36	“ No . ”
13412	13415	13416	13416	I	0	“ But — ”
13421	13426	13416	13416	I	0	“ We ’re eloping . ”
13427	13439	13375	13375	She	36	“ No , we ca n’t . At least not anymore . ”
13440	13462	13463	13463	Predictable	68	“ Let me guess , you ’ll back out of our arrangement if I do n’t go along with your plan . ”
13472	13493	13463	13463	Predictable	68	“ What ? No . But I ’d really appreciate it if you work with me on this . Please . ”
13519	13527	13514	13514	I	0	“ So , this is a request . ”
13528	13550	13562	13562	she	36	“ A big one given your view on weddings , but I would n’t ask you unless it was absolutely necessary . ”
13551	13557	13558	13558	Her	36	“ You owe me one . ”
13570	13575	13562	13562	she	36	“ Consider us even . ”
13586	13601	13602	13602	She	36	“ Sign the contract and get out of here before I change my mind . ”
13609	13639	13640	13640	You	0	“ Sure . Once you make the appropriate changes , including upping the initial payment to three hundred million dollars , then I ’ll go ahead and sign it . ”
13643	13650	13651	13651	Her	36	“ You think you ’re clever . ”
13663	13679	13651	13651	Her	36	“ I never asked for an increased paycheck , but since you so generously offered … ”
13694	13698	13699	13699	She	36	“ Well played . ”
13702	13715	13699	13699	She	36	“ Thank you , sir . You taught me everything I know . ”
13805	13816	13817	13817	Declan	402	“ I need you to revise this report for Yakura . ”
13823	13826	13827	13827	I	0	“ Again ? ”
13830	13840	13841	13841	He	402	“ This is the third time in six months . ”
13853	13875	13841	13841	He	402	“ Are you still struggling with the printer ? I could show you how it works if you have a second . ”
13884	13898	13841	13841	He	402	“ I expect to receive your notes by the end of the day . ”
13899	13902	13841	13841	He	402	“ Today ? ”
13903	13909	13841	13841	He	402	“ Is that a problem ? ”
13910	13937	13938	13938	I	0	“ Nope . I ’ll just fit it in between planning our wedding , picking out a dress , and going to a cake tasting tonight . ”
13945	13956	13957	13957	He	402	“ Perfect . Have it on my desk by nine . ”
14044	14047	14052	14052	me	0	“ Iris ? ”
14062	14065	14066	14066	Our	390	“ Yes ? ”
14098	14104	14081	14081	I	0	“ Thank you for everything . ”
14231	14234	14228	14228	he	720	“ thank you ”
14392	14401	14402	14402	Cal	720	“ Your fairy godfather has arrived with reinforcements . ”
14411	14417	14402	14402	Cal	720	“ Oh God . Yes . ”
14430	14435	14402	14402	Cal	720	“ I love you . ”
14436	14440	14464	14464	he	720	“ I know . ”
14441	14454	14455	14455	I	0	“ Do you mind ? I ’m having a private conversation here . ”
14469	14476	14464	14464	he	720	“ How are the revisions going ? ”
14477	14512	14513	14513	Cal	720	“ Terrible . I ’m not sure what Mr. Yakura wants from us . This is the hundredth time he ’s sent back our Dreamland Tokyo proposal — this time with one single comment . ”
14517	14520	14513	14513	Cal	720	“ What ? ”
14521	14526	14527	14527	His	720	“ Something ’s missing . ”
14531	14538	14527	14527	His	720	“ Seriously ? That ’s it ? ”
14539	14552	14513	14513	Cal	720	“ Yes ! But I ca n’t figure out what ’s lacking . ”
14553	14568	14569	14569	I	0	“ Did you talk to Rowan ? He could look at your latest ideas . ”
14574	14592	14569	14569	I	0	“ Declan and I met with him a month ago , but it did n’t end well . ”
14593	14606	14609	14609	Rowan	715	“ Declan ’s still pissed at him about the whole Dreamland thing ? ”
14673	14702	14670	14670	I	0	“ Yeah . I think the pressure from Mr. Yakura is getting to him . We ’ve been working on this deal for months already without any payoff . ”
14703	14727	14728	14728	I	0	“ You could find another sponsor willing to sell their land . Many people would kill for a cut of Dreamland ’s profits . ”
14733	14775	14728	14728	I	0	“ Declan insisted it has to be this property . I ’m pretty sure Yakura can sense how badly Declan wants it , so that ’s why he ’s being so difficult about everything . Maybe he wants a bigger payout . ”
14776	14794	14795	14795	I	0	“ Either that or he likes being one of the few people who can make Declan sweat . ”
14798	14812	14795	14795	I	0	“ Possibly . Does n’t make the rejection any easier to handle though . ”
14813	14838	14728	14728	I	0	“ Do n’t take it personally . Your ideas are great , so it ’s only a matter of time before he gives in . ”
14839	14845	14846	14846	My	0	“ Easier said than done . ”
14876	14882	14872	14872	he	720	“ Want me to help ? ”
14883	14890	14891	14891	Declan	402	“ No , we do n’t . ”
14920	14936	14911	14911	Cal	720	“ Hello , brother . How are you this afternoon ? Make anyone cry yet ? ”
14937	14946	14947	14947	Cal	720	“ No , but it ’s only noon . ”
14955	14971	14972	14972	I	0	“ I do n’t know why you agreed to marry him . He ’s insufferable . ”
14975	14983	14972	14972	I	0	“ His personality has grown on me . ”
14984	15004	15005	15005	Declan	402	“ I swear you ’re suffering from some kind of workplace Stockholm syndrome . There ’s no other explanation . ”
15017	15032	15005	15005	Declan	402	“ Get lost . Some of us actually have work to do around here . ”
15033	15056	15057	15057	My	0	“ Being the Kane family disappointment is a full - time job , thank you very much . Benefits are shit though . ”
15063	15079	15080	15080	Declan	402	“ I swear you were only put on this earth to make my life miserable . ”
15090	15103	15086	15086	Cal	720	“ I finally found my life ’s purpose all thanks to you . ”
15117	15130	15131	15131	Cal	720	“ Bye , Iris ! See you at the cake tasting tonight . ”
15165	15172	15155	15155	He	402	“ What is he talking about ? ”
15187	15200	15173	15173	I	0	“ I asked Cal to go with me to taste wedding cakes . ”
15201	15210	15211	15211	My	0	“ You did n’t think to ask me ? ”
15215	15231	15211	15211	My	0	“ Umm … no . You did n’t seem interested when I mentioned it earlier . ”
15232	15243	15245	15246	my God	219	“ I did n’t think you would invite my brother . ”
15303	15318	15319	15319	Declan	402	“ He invited himself when I told him I was going alone after work . ”
15331	15340	15324	15324	he	402	“ Tell Cal he ’s not needed anymore . ”
15348	15351	15341	15341	I	0	“ No . ”
15352	15360	15361	15361	He	402	“ What time is the cake tasting ? ”
15371	15374	15365	15365	he	402	“ Why ? ”
15375	15385	15386	15386	He	402	“ I ’m going . Send Harrison the address . ”
15423	15426	15429	15429	my	0	“ Iris . ”
15432	15440	15429	15429	my	0	“ Go away . I ’m sleeping . ”
15452	15459	15441	15441	I	0	“ We need to get going . ”
15460	15480	15488	15488	me	0	“ Ugh . Now you ’re bothering me in my dreams too ? Will I ever catch a break ? ”
15512	15517	15518	15518	He	405	“ We ’re late . ”
15530	15536	15537	15537	I	0	“ Late ? What for ? ”
15540	15545	15537	15537	I	0	“ The cake tasting . ”

15610	15621	15622	15622	I	0	“ I called and told them we would be late . ”
15625	15629	15622	15622	I	0	“ You called ? ”
15630	15637	15575	15575	I	0	“ It took me two seconds . ”
15638	15646	15622	15622	I	0	“ Why not just wake me up ? ”
15649	15657	15622	15622	I	0	“ How long have I been asleep ? ”
15658	15662	15622	15622	I	0	“ Two hours . ”
15663	15667	15622	15622	I	0	“ Two hours ! ”

16473	16507	16508	16508	He	412	“ Great . Then let me FaceTime Cal and have him weigh in on this debate . If you wanted to be friends with us , all you needed to do was ask — ”
16517	16531	16508	16508	He	412	“ I already told you I do n’t want to be your friend . ”

16795	16805	16771	16771	She	36	“ You want me to move in this weekend ? ”
16806	16809	16771	16771	She	36	“ Yes . ”

16845	16864	16835	16835	She	36	“ There ’s no moving company that is going to be available at the last minute like that . ”
16865	16873	16835	16835	She	36	“ They will be for a price . ”
16874	16885	16835	16835	She	36	“ But I ’d have to break my lease early . ”
16886	16893	16835	16835	She	36	“ I ’ll cover the cost . ”
16894	16906	16907	16907	I	0	“ Or I can still keep the place just in case — ”
16912	16937	16938	16938	Her	36	“ How do you think it would look to the public if they found out you kept your place ‘ just in case ’ ? ”

17311	17337	17274	17274	Iris	36	“ Then thank God we ’re not having a child the old - fashioned way or else I ’d be stuck doing all the work . ”

17360	17371	17372	17372	She	36	“ I ’d rather be that than a lazy lay . ”
17518	17522	17509	17509	Iris	36	“ All done ! ”
17588	17596	17597	17597	She	36	“ You have more plants than things . ”

17619	17624	17625	17625	Her	36	“ Nothing is preferable . ”
17635	17647	17625	17625	Her	36	“ How does it feel to have someone in your space ? ”
17648	17651	17597	17597	She	36	“ Loud . ”
17652	17669	17625	17625	Her	36	“ Imagine how you ’ll feel once you have a child running around here and screaming . ”
17670	17679	17680	17680	She	36	“ I ’ll invest in a bark collar . ”
17683	17691	17692	17692	I	0	“ Please tell me you ’re joking . ”
17700	17711	17712	17712	She	36	“ Fuck . Of course I ’m not being serious . ”
17720	17735	17712	17712	She	36	“ Although a sound - proofed bedroom does n’t sound like a bad idea . ”
17740	17746	17712	17712	She	36	“ For them or you ? ”
17747	17756	17757	17757	She	36	“ Them . Mine was remodeled years ago . ”
17787	17790	17791	17791	She	36	“ So … ”
17803	17813	17798	17798	she	36	“ How exactly do we go about this situation ? ”
17836	17844	17845	17845	She	36	“ What are you carrying in here ? ”
17857	17862	17845	17845	She	36	“ My high heels . ”
17863	17873	17874	17874	She	36	“ They ’ll look great inside of the fireplace . ”
17889	17895	17897	17897	her	36	“ You would n’t dare . ”
17963	17977	17956	17956	she	36	“ You should know better than to underestimate me after all this time . ”
17986	18003	17978	17978	She	36	“ Declan Lancelot Kane . I swear if one single shoe goes missing , I will — ”
18004	18011	18012	18012	I	0	“ Do n’t call me that , ”
18018	18032	18015	18015	She	36	“ Would you prefer for me to use the more formal Sir Lancelot ? ”
18033	18041	18042	18042	She	36	“ What I prefer is your silence . ”
18047	18053	18042	18042	She	36	“ You ’re no fun . ”
18054	18063	18015	18015	She	36	“ This is n’t supposed to be fun . ”
18098	18130	18133	18133	her	36	“ I swear , you ’re going to die of a heart attack one day from all this pent - up angst . It ’s not good for your blood pressure . ”
18141	18150	18131	18131	I	0	“ I ’ll show you to our room . ”
18151	18155	18156	18156	She	36	“ Our room ? ”
18162	18178	18156	18156	She	36	“ I ca n’t have the housekeeper speaking out against the legitimacy of our agreement . ”
18179	18185	18186	18186	She	36	“ Right . Of course . ”
18262	18274	18227	18227	She	36	“ Wow . It ’s a lot brighter than I expected . ”
18275	18290	18291	18291	Her	36	“ Contrary to popular belief , coffins do n’t make for comfortable sleeping arrangements . ”
18315	18324	18303	18303	I	0	“ You ’ll keep your clothes in here . ”
18325	18341	18342	18342	Her	36	“ But I ’m not — we’re not — you do n’t expect me to — ”

18400	18405	18393	18393	Her	36	“ Right . That . ”
18406	18409	18410	18410	She	36	“ No . ”
18417	18427	18410	18410	She	36	“ Thank God . That would have been awkward . ”
18428	18431	18393	18393	Her	36	“ Right . ”
18439	18464	18393	18393	Her	36	“ In the house , we can act how we want . But in public , I expect you to appear affectionate toward me . ”
18465	18480	18410	18410	She	36	“ Are you sure you can stand my touch for extended periods of time ? ”
18481	18496	18497	18497	I	0	“ It ’ll push me to my limits , but I ’ll make do . ”
18517	18532	18514	18514	She	36	“ You built a hidden door to another room ? In a closet ? ! ”
18533	18536	18410	18410	She	36	“ Yes . ”
18537	18541	18514	18514	She	36	“ But why ? ”
18542	18552	18514	18514	She	36	“ Because I was preparing for something like this . ”
18561	18564	18565	18565	She	36	“ Wait . ”
18571	18578	18565	18565	She	36	“ People prepare for fake marriages ? ”
18579	18593	18594	18594	Her	36	“ It ’s to be expected once you reach a certain tax bracket . ”
18598	18603	18594	18594	Her	36	“ That ’s gross . ”
18604	18611	18612	18612	She	36	“ No . It ’s life . ”
18650	18655	18658	18658	her	36	“ This is beautiful . ”
18685	18713	18714	18714	She	36	“ You can decorate it however you want . I only ask that you keep on top of cleaning since the housekeeper is n’t permitted to enter . ”
18720	18732	18714	18714	She	36	“ You ’ve really thought of everything , have n’t you ? ”
18733	18739	18714	18714	She	36	“ Everything except for you . ”
18743	18760	18761	18761	Cal	720	“ Looks like Iris is making herself at home . I ’m sure you love that . ”
18812	18825	18826	18826	He	720	“ How is the progress on your part of Grandfather ’s will ? ”
18829	18845	18826	18826	He	720	“ What ’s the rush ? It ’s not like you ’re becoming CEO tomorrow . ”
18846	18866	18867	18867	His	720	“ No , but if I have my way , I will be by the end of the year . ”
18871	18880	18867	18867	His	720	“ Does Iris know about this accelerated timeline ? ”
18881	18892	18893	18893	His	720	“ She knew the deal when she signed the contract . ”
18897	18911	18893	18893	His	720	“ Does n’t mean she ’s ready to have a child right now . ”
18912	18930	18867	18867	His	720	“ Good thing she will have an additional nine months to warm up to the idea then . ”
18942	18955	18867	18867	His	720	“ And here we thought marrying her would humanize you a bit . ”
18956	18963	18893	18893	His	720	“ Why would you think that ? ”
18964	18970	18867	18867	His	720	“ Because you respect her . ”
18971	18975	18976	18976	Her	443	“ I do . ”
19081	19091	19063	19063	she	36	“ And we know you are attracted to her . ”
19096	19106	19063	19063	she	36	“ Who is this we you keep speaking of ? ”
19107	19111	19150	19150	Cal	720	“ Rowan and I. ”
19112	19149	19150	19150	Cal	720	“ Do n’t you have anything better to do than gossip about me behind my back ? Like , oh I do n’t know , go find Alana and do whatever Grandpa asked you to do ? ”
19230	19238	19226	19226	His	720	“ It ’s not going to work . ”
19239	19242	19226	19226	His	720	“ What ? ”
19243	19261	19226	19226	His	720	“ You trying to get a rise out of me because you ’re feeling defensive about Iris . ”
19262	19273	19226	19226	His	720	“ Why would I feel the need to be defensive ? ”
19274	19306	19307	19307	He	720	“ You tell me since you were the one who said you did n’t care who you married , so long as they were … How did you phrase it again ? ”
19312	19334	19307	19307	He	720	“ Oh right . ‘ Practical , fertile , and has a face considered proportionate enough to be deemed attractive . ’ ”
19342	19349	19307	19307	He	720	“ I know what I said . ”
19350	19361	19362	19362	My	0	“ Did n’t seem to age well , did it ? ”
19366	19377	19362	19362	My	0	“ What ’s your point in bringing all this up ? ”
19378	19386	19387	19387	I	0	“ I mention it as a warning . ”
19403	19447	19450	19450	him	0	“ You might be my brother , but Iris is my best friend . And while I want you to succeed and become CEO , I wo n’t let you destroy her in your pursuit of whatever you think might make you happy . ”
19455	19480	19448	19448	I	0	“ If Iris is concerned , she can speak to me herself . She does n’t need to send her guard dog after me . ”
19481	19491	19511	19511	His	0	“ She ’s not concerned , but I am . ”
19492	19510	19511	19511	His	0	“ If this is what friendship entails , I see why I ’m better off without it . ”
19519	19526	19511	19511	His	0	“ Do n’t break her heart . ”
19535	19545	19511	19511	His	0	“ That should be the least of your worries . ”
19546	19573	19448	19448	I	0	“ Of course I worry . You ’re a cold - hearted bastard who does n’t know the first thing about taking care of someone else . ”
19574	19586	19587	19587	His	0	“ I helped raise you and you turned out decent enough . ”
19591	19611	19587	19587	His	0	“ We ’re your blood . You ’re forced to like us , whether you want to or not . ”
19612	19629	19587	19587	His	0	“ Blood does n’t mean shit to me . You of all people should know that . ”
19680	19687	19673	19673	He	454	“ Just take care of her . ”
19711	19719	19673	19673	He	454	“ Are you in love with her ? ”
19739	19742	19732	19732	His	454	“ No . ”
19743	19756	19761	19761	he	454	“ For some reason , I ’m finding that hard to believe . ”
19777	19782	19766	19766	I	0	“ We kissed once . ”
19798	19802	19790	19790	I	0	“ You what ? ”
19816	19822	19790	19790	I	0	“ It was a mistake . ”
19823	19831	19790	19790	I	0	“ It sure as fuck better be . ”
19854	19861	19847	19847	His	454	“ I knew you were jealous . ”
19862	19875	19876	19876	He	454	“ As if I could ever be jealous of someone like you . ”
19879	19893	19876	19876	He	454	“ The way you look like you want to murder me says otherwise . ”
19894	19909	19910	19910	He	454	“ Torture is my preferred method of revenge , just so you ’re aware . ”
19920	19933	19910	19910	He	454	“ If it makes you feel better , the kiss was terrible . ”
20007	20020	20021	20021	I	0	“ You ’re really selling me on the idea of marrying her , ”
20041	20068	20034	20034	His	454	“ It had nothing to do with her . I was drunk , and she was lonely . The result was awkward to say the least . ”
20069	20074	20034	20034	His	454	“ She was lonely ? ”
20075	20093	20034	20034	His	454	“ Of course she is . Her being friends with me should have been your first clue . ”
20094	20104	20034	20034	His	454	“ I was n’t aware she felt that way . ”
20105	20133	20134	20134	I	0	“ What ? Do you expect her to talk to you about it ? Unlike the rest of the human population , you like being by yourself . ”
20207	20222	20223	20223	He	461	“ Kiss her again and I ’ll enjoy ripping your tongue from your throat . ”
20229	20267	20223	20223	He	461	“ The only reason I told you about our kiss is so that you can stop thinking I want to make a move on her . I ’m not interested in her like that . Trust me . ”
20268	20275	20276	20276	I	0	“ Because the kiss was terrible , ”
20287	20301	20304	20304	she	462	“ Because she was never meant to be mine in the first place . ”
20330	20348	20349	20349	I	0	“ Oh , fuck off . I ca n’t believe I woke up early for this shit ! ”
20456	20474	20475	20475	Declan	402	“ Another rain delay ? ! Since when are the stewards afraid of a little summer shower ? ”
20496	20500	20486	20486	I	0	“ Six a.m. ? ”
20662	20668	20641	20641	Declan	402	“ Is that a mimosa ? ”

20903	20925	20929	20929	his	402	“ You ’re one to talk . The donuts are supposed to go in your mouth , not on your shirt . ”
20980	20986	20987	20987	I	0	“ You missed a spot . ”
21033	21043	21017	21017	He	402	“ Be a good fiancée and help me out . ”

21272	21286	21259	21259	I	0	“ Why would you ever willingly wake up this early on a weekend ? ”
21287	21292	21322	21322	He	402	“ It ’s Sunday . ”
21293	21312	21259	21259	I	0	“ I do n’t care if you ’re Jesus himself , no one should be yelling at 6 a.m. ”
21336	21351	21322	21322	He	402	“ Fuck you , Cruz . No one cares about your shitty start position . ”
21368	21381	21359	21359	Declan	402	“ It ’s like I do n’t even recognize you right now . ”
21382	21396	21397	21397	I	0	“ I ca n’t tell if that ’s a good or bad thing . ”
21400	21407	21397	21397	I	0	“ It ’s a weird thing . ”
21468	21474	21475	21475	I	0	“ What are you watching ? ”

21517	21528	21505	21505	His	402	“ You ’re right . This marriage will never work . ”
21529	21533	21475	21475	I	0	“ Shut up . ”
21534	21537	21538	21538	he	402	“ Mimosa ? ”
21551	21564	21541	21541	I	0	“ Who knew a whiskey snob like yourself enjoys something so frilly ? ”
21565	21575	21576	21576	He	402	“ My mom liked drinking them on race days . ”
21682	21692	21673	21673	I	0	“ Was she the reason you got into racing ? ”
21693	21709	21710	21710	His	402	“ No . Grandpa is — or rather was — to blame for that one . ”
21722	21735	21710	21710	His	402	“ Let me guess , he roped your mother in with alcohol . ”
21736	21747	21748	21748	He	402	“ Welcome to the dark side — we have liquor . ”
21761	21778	21755	21755	My	0	“ So what exactly is happening that has you raging at the TV like a toddler . ”
21779	21791	21710	21710	His	402	“ I ’m guessing you ’ve never seen a race before . ”

22736	22741	22707	22707	He	720	“ Declan appreciates me . ”
22742	22752	22753	22753	My	0	“ So long as you do everything he wants . ”
22757	22767	22768	22768	I	0	“ That ’s not true and you know it . ”
22815	22830	22807	22807	I	0	“ His appreciation is built on contingencies , just like everything else about him . ”
22831	22845	22847	22847	our	487	“ What do you expect me to do ? We ’re getting married . ”
22855	22864	22865	22865	My	0	“ You could tell him about your ideas . ”
22886	22889	22880	22880	Cal	720	“ What ? ”
22890	22904	22865	22865	My	0	“ There ’s a reason I never told him about my transfer request . ”
22905	22922	22880	22880	Cal	720	“ I know that . But things will be different now . I can guarantee it . ”
22923	22930	22931	22931	He	720	“ Because I ’m marrying him ? ”
22947	22956	22940	22940	He	720	“ You have something Rowan does n’t have . ”
22957	22972	22973	22973	He	720	“ If you say vagina , I ’ll make you regret not having one . ”
22976	22988	22989	22989	I	0	“ Jesus . I was going to say a marriage contract . ”
22992	22999	22989	22989	I	0	“ As if that means anything . ”
23000	23024	22940	22940	He	720	“ Maybe not yet but give it time . If there is anyone Declan has a soft spot for , it ’s you . ”
23025	23034	23035	23035	I	0	“ You consider this having a soft spot ? ”
23047	23060	23035	23035	I	0	“ You could quit . Take your ideas and start somewhere fresh . ”
23061	23075	23076	23076	Cal	720	“ I ca n’t leave him right now . Our relationship complicates things . ”
23081	23116	23117	23117	I	0	“ No , it does n’t . Actually , if anything , it makes all the more sense for you to leave . It ’s a conflict of interest to work for your husband . ”
23120	23125	23117	23117	I	0	“ He needs me . ”
23126	23145	23146	23146	Cal	720	“ He does n’t need anyone . He makes it pretty damn clear every time anyone says so . ”
23162	23177	23146	23146	Cal	720	“ He does n’t even know how to operate a printer on his own . ”
23178	23187	23117	23117	I	0	“ He does n’t want to know how . ”
23188	23191	23117	23117	I	0	“ Why ? ”
23192	23202	23203	23203	He	720	“ Because what else would you be useful for ? ”
23219	23235	23236	23236	I	0	“ For your information , I just caught a mistake on Declan ’s quarterly report . ”
23243	23257	23236	23236	I	0	“ Children with dyslexia around the world are rejoicing at your success story . ”
23266	23280	23258	23258	I	0	“ I do n’t know why I ever admitted the truth to you . ”
23281	23302	23303	23303	My	0	“ Because you needed a shoulder to cry on after Declan ripped you a new one after your unforgivable typo . ”
23312	23322	23303	23303	My	0	“ You promised to never bring that up again . ”
23425	23449	23450	23450	Cal	720	“ You ’ve come a long way since then . Declan even respects you enough to let you lead some of his presentations . ”
23458	23479	23480	23480	My	0	“ But that does n’t mean you should give up your dream because you think my brothers are more important . ”
23484	23492	23480	23480	My	0	“ It ’s not the right time . ”
23493	23506	23556	23556	Declan	402	“ There ’s never a right time to make a hard choice . ”
23507	23517	23480	23480	My	0	“ How much weed did you smoke this morning ? ”
23518	23531	23532	23532	I	0	“ Not enough to be the voice of reason in this conversation . ”
23537	23549	23532	23532	I	0	“ I ’m not quitting right now , so drop it . ”
23550	23555	23556	23556	Declan	402	“ Not quitting what ? ”
23587	23600	23601	23601	Cal	720	“ Yes , Iris , what exactly are you thinking of quitting ? ”
23614	23627	23628	23628	Declan	402	“ Fancy seeing you back so soon , brother . Forget something ? ”
23650	23656	23657	23657	I	0	“ Umm … You see … ”
23680	23691	23692	23692	Cal	720	“ She did n’t want to tell you the truth — ”
23708	23719	23696	23696	I	0	“ I ’m not quitting until we adopt a dog . ”
23754	23758	23759	23759	he	720	“ A dog , ”
23762	23771	23772	23772	Cal	720	“ Oh , yes . Iris loves dogs , ”
23799	23822	23823	23823	I	0	“ My mom never let me have a pet , so now might be the perfect chance for me to have one . ”
23848	23854	23855	23855	Declan	402	“ You want a dog , ”
23878	23892	23855	23855	Declan	402	“ Yes . A big , fluffy dog that follows me around everywhere . ”
23893	23896	23898	23898	yourself	493	“ No . ”
23910	23942	23855	23855	Declan	402	“ But I ’ll do everything by myself . I know crate training can be annoying , but I doubt you ’ll hear them howling over the sound of your snores . ”
23943	23957	23855	23855	Declan	402	“ There is n’t a chance in hell I ’m letting that happen . ”
23958	23974	23855	23855	Declan	402	“ But think of all the serotonin we could be boosting if we had one . ”
23975	23981	23982	23982	He	720	“ My decision is final . ”
23993	24006	23982	23982	He	720	“ ‘ My decision is final . ’ What a pretentious ass . ”
24020	24030	24012	24012	I	0	“ You bastard . Why do you do that ? ”
24031	24040	23855	23855	Declan	402	“ You could have told him the truth . ”
24041	24044	24012	24012	I	0	“ Never . ”
24045	24070	24071	24071	I	0	“ Then I guess do n’t get angry when you come home one day to a cute puppy in need of a loving home . ”
24078	24093	24071	24071	I	0	“ Do n’t you dare ! He would kill me if you did that . ”
24094	24117	24149	24149	IRIS	36	“ You have to admit that it would be a bit funny for you to adopt a dog when you hate them . ”
24118	24135	24149	24149	IRIS	36	“ I do n’t hate dogs ! What kind of monster do you take me for ? ”
24136	24147	24149	24149	IRIS	36	“ The kind who actually enjoys working for my brother . ”
24150	24157	24149	24149	IRIS	36	“ Are you sure about this ? ”
24176	24191	24192	24192	He	402	“ My answer has n’t changed since you last asked me three minutes ago . ”
24279	24289	24290	24290	I	0	“ Well , we better get this over with . ”
24306	24310	24290	24290	I	0	“ No elevator ? ”
24311	24326	24333	24333	he	258	“ Only if you want to wait for the fire department to rescue you . ”
24347	24351	24352	24352	He	258	“ Charming place . ”
24365	24375	24352	24352	He	258	“ Do n’t judge until you see the inside . ”
24376	24383	24384	24384	he	258	“ I ’m overcome with anticipation , ”
24391	24394	24384	24384	he	258	“ Jerk . ”
24525	24559	24511	24511	She	62	“ I now understand why you ’re willing to work weekends and holidays for this man . If my boss had looked half as good as him , I would have never quit . ”
24615	24625	24626	24626	He	402	“ I ’m Declan . Nice to meet you . ”
24632	24639	24640	24640	Nana	62	“ Nice to meet you too . ”
24673	24684	24666	24666	My	0	“ I see where you get your sparkling personality from . ”
24856	24873	24847	24847	Mom	453	“ I ’ll be out in a few minutes ! Make yourself at home , Declan . ”
24928	24936	24937	24937	He	402	“ This is where you grew up ? ”
24954	24962	24963	24963	He	402	“ Spent most of my life here . ”
24983	24994	24979	24979	I	0	“ Although the carpet was in better condition back then . ”
24995	25001	25002	25002	He	402	“ One could only hope . ”
25110	25119	25107	25107	his	402	“ I take it you three are close ? ”
25120	25134	25173	25173	he	402	“ Depends on the day and if Nana took her meds that morning . ”
25135	25140	25141	25141	Nana	62	“ I heard that ! ”
25153	25170	25145	25145	Declan	402	“ I can imagine growing up in a home like this came with its … perks . ”
25186	25202	25203	25203	Mom	453	“ I never thought I would see the day when my daughter fell in love . ”
25228	25240	25222	25222	I	0	“ You just love to embarrass me , do n’t you ? ”
25241	25261	25272	25272	She	453	“ You think this is embarrassing ? I have n’t even offered to show Declan your baby album yet . ”
25262	25267	25268	25268	Mom	453	“ You would n’t . ”
25286	25306	25307	25307	I	0	“ It ’s nice to meet you , Declan . I ’ve heard so many good things about you . ”
25312	25325	25307	25307	I	0	“ Do n’t lie . It does scary things for his ego . ”
25348	25355	25341	25341	He	402	“ The pleasure is all mine . ”
25374	25387	25372	25372	Asshole	88	“ Please come and sit . Can I get you a drink ? ”
25430	25435	25436	25436	Mom	453	“ Water is fine . ”
25440	25468	25436	25436	Mom	453	“ Of course ! I ’ll get you a glass . I apologize for my mother ’s manners earlier . She does n’t leave the house often . ”
25469	25479	25480	25480	Nana	62	“ Only because you stole my driver ’s license , ”
25486	25509	25480	25480	Nana	62	“ Excuse them . They must be suffering from a carbon monoxide leak or something . They ’re not usually like this . ”
25519	25531	25510	25510	Nana	62	“ Why lie to him ? We ’re always like this . ”
25542	25548	25532	25532	I	0	“ Welcome to my family . ”
25581	25598	25599	25599	Declan	402	“ Not yet . He needs to pass the Landry test before he ’s officially inducted . ”
25604	25612	25613	25613	Nana	62	“ I hope you like spicy food . ”
25653	25658	25659	25659	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
25829	25846	25847	25847	Declan	402	“ So , Declan , when did you realize you were in love with my daughter ? ”
25862	25871	25872	25872	Nana	62	“ Aw . You ’re making him nervous . ”
25910	25939	25940	25940	His	402	“ I think part of me always knew she would be the one . It just took a while for the rest of my brain to catch up . ”
25999	26009	26010	26010	Nana	62	“ Why did you hold back for so long ? ”
26021	26029	26010	26010	Nana	62	“ It was n’t the right time . ”
26049	26082	26046	26046	Mom	453	“ Well , I ’m surprised she gave you a chance . I ’ve been trying to set her up with one of the teachers at my school but she always declines — ”
26083	26092	26093	26093	I	0	“ Because I was n’t interested , obviously . ”
26130	26142	26143	26143	Nana	62	“ Iris leaves a trail of broken hearts wherever she goes . ”
26155	26162	26163	26163	I	0	“ No , I do n’t . ”
26175	26190	26169	26169	Nana	62	“ Did you know her last boyfriend proposed to her and she rejected him ? ”
26191	26194	26169	26169	Nana	62	“ Nana ! ”
26195	26225	26169	26169	Nana	62	“ What ? I just find it interesting that you are finally willing to settle down . What happened to swearing off men for the rest of your life ? ”
26226	26231	26232	26232	Declan	402	“ Your ex proposed ? ”
26430	26444	26445	26445	Mom	453	“ Poor man rented out a nice restaurant and everything for the occasion , ”
26448	26456	26457	26457	Declan	402	“ Ring in a glass of champagne ? ”
26463	26474	26460	26460	Mom	453	“ Oh , yes . Iris nearly choked on it . ”
26482	26489	26460	26460	Mom	453	“ Rose petals on the table ? ”
26490	26493	26494	26494	Nana	62	“ Yes ! ”
26497	26503	26494	26494	Nana	62	“ Red . Her favorite . ”
26520	26527	26528	26528	Declan	402	“ Sounds like everything you love . ”
26538	26545	26535	26536	an asshole	536	“ I wonder what went wrong . ”
26567	26585	26586	26586	Nana	62	“ I guess it was n’t good enough because Iris over here flat - out rejected him , ”
26589	26593	26586	26586	Nana	62	“ How unfortunate . ”
26635	26639	26640	26640	Nana	62	“ Unfortunate indeed . ”
26649	26657	26640	26640	Nana	62	“ Imagine if she had said yes . ”
26658	26675	26676	26676	He	536	“ With that kind of generic proposal , it ’s a shocker that she did n’t . ”
26792	26811	26812	26812	Mom	453	“ Is now a good moment to tell you about the time Iris set a church on fire ? ”
26815	26826	26827	26827	Declan	402	“ I ca n’t wait to hear about this one . ”
26881	26885	26886	26886	Mom	453	“ I approve . ”
26913	26926	26927	26927	She	453	“ You better after all the emotional trauma you put me through . ”
26930	26974	26927	26927	She	453	“ I hope he can forgive me for the chicken . He was only supposed to eat a few bites , but the man cleared his entire plate . I ’m pretty sure I used a whole bottle of cayenne pepper this time . ”
26975	27003	27034	27034	Mom	453	“ I ’m still bitter he beat your grandpa ’s record . That man lost half of his taste buds after I made the chicken for him . ”
27004	27015	27016	27016	I	0	“ Do you think he knew it was a test ? ”
27019	27024	27025	27025	Declan	402	“ He does now . ”
27044	27056	27034	27034	Mom	453	“ To be fair , it really is a family tradition . ”
27066	27076	27057	27057	I	0	“ Any other traditions I should be aware of ? ”
27077	27080	27081	27084	the three of us	524	“ No , ”

27108	27115	27116	27116	Nana	62	“ At least nothing too dangerous , ”
27133	27138	27139	27139	He	402	“ We ’re leaving . ”
27150	27176	27177	27177	Nana	62	“ Thank you for an interesting meal . I would say it was a pleasure , but I ca n’t feel half of my tongue . ”
27331	27345	27348	27348	me	0	“ So , was it as bad as you thought it would be ? ”
27368	27374	27348	27348	me	0	“ The food was awful . ”
27387	27390	27375	27375	I	0	“ And ? ”
27391	27412	27413	27413	I	0	“ And the company was n’t too terrible . Although I could have done without being ambushed near the bathroom . ”
27420	27430	27431	27431	She	547	“ What did Nana say to you in private ? ”
27447	27452	27439	27439	Declan	402	“ She threatened me . ”
27453	27456	27457	27457	I	0	“ No . ”

27478	27497	27457	27457	I	0	“ What exactly is an appropriate reply for being told my intestines would make a nice winter scarf ? ”
27498	27508	27457	27457	I	0	“ She ’s been on a mafia kick lately . ”
27509	27530	27439	27439	Declan	402	“ That explains how she knew a lot about sulfuric acid and the different ways to dispose of a body . ”
27531	27547	27457	27457	I	0	“ I did try to warn you about my family . They ’re a bit … ”
27548	27551	27552	27552	I	0	“ Overbearing ? ”
27555	27561	27552	27552	I	0	“ They worry about me . ”
27562	27570	27457	27457	I	0	“ They have a good reason to . ”
27571	27574	27439	27439	Declan	402	“ Why ? ”
27575	27598	27552	27552	I	0	“ You got engaged out of the blue to someone who is n’t exactly known to be the nicest man in Chicago . ”
27599	27612	27457	27457	I	0	“ Now , now . At least you ’re not the worst . ”
27613	27625	27457	27457	I	0	“ I ’m sure that really helps them sleep at night . ”

27668	27675	27676	27676	I	0	“ Maybe just a little bit ? ”

28020	28031	27999	27999	She	36	“ Is this your attempt at making me feel better ? ”
28038	28045	28046	28046	She	36	“ They say misery loves company . ”

28651	28662	28663	28663	She	36	“ To think you know me better than anyone else . ”
28681	28688	28689	28689	She	36	“ How are you holding up ? ”
28713	28718	28719	28719	I	0	“ People are watching , ”
28745	28757	28737	28737	Her	36	“ No wonder you hate going out . This is exhausting . ”
28758	28765	28766	28766	I	0	“ Now she finally gets it , ”
28777	28803	28769	28769	She	36	“ I never understood why you hated talking to people but now I totally do . Who would want to with a family like yours ? ”
28804	28818	28819	28819	My	0	“ If hell were a theme park , they would have lifetime passes . ”

28841	28863	28864	28864	Her	36	“ Easy . If you stop being social , there is no ladder for them to climb in the first place . ”
28869	28894	28895	28895	I	0	“ Well , I better get back to being the cheery one . With you hiding , one of us needs to be present . ”
28909	28914	28901	28901	she	36	“ Do n’t go . ”
28920	28924	28925	28925	Her	36	“ Why not ? ”
28963	28971	28954	28954	She	36	“ You make tonight somewhat more bearable . ”
29023	29029	29011	29011	She	36	“ What a glowing compliment . ”
29039	29048	29011	29011	She	36	“ Do you want to hear some more ? ”
29049	29052	29011	29011	She	36	“ No . ”
29066	29070	29011	29011	She	36	“ Why not ? ”
29071	29079	29011	29011	She	36	“ I prefer you grumpy and predictable . ”

29166	29171	29190	29190	She	36	“ You know why . ”
29172	29189	29190	29190	She	36	“ Maybe but that does n’t mean I do n’t want to hear you say it . ”
29254	29267	29245	29245	I	0	“ You ’re staying with me for the rest of the night . ”
29286	29298	29275	29275	She	36	“ You ’re kind of cute when you get all flustered . ”
29299	29305	29306	29306	She	36	“ I ’m not flustered . ”
29371	29378	29379	29379	Iris	36	“ What did you just say ? ”
29418	29421	29430	29430	My	0	“ Nothing . ”
29559	29564	29544	29544	Iris	36	“ Is everything okay ? ”
29565	29569	29570	29570	I	0	“ Of course . ”
29593	29612	29581	29581	She	36	“ Great because your father is headed this way and the smile on his face is downright malicious . ”
29649	29658	29659	29659	Iris	36	“ Just the couple I was looking for . ”
29672	29685	29686	29686	I	0	“ Mr. Kane . How nice of you to make it tonight . ”
29730	29742	29718	29718	His	258	“ Please call me Seth . We are practically family now . ”

29758	29776	29755	29755	I	0	“ Paying for a family does n’t make you an expert on the matter by any means . ”
29777	29789	29790	29790	Iris	36	“ Neither does being an absentee alcoholic who hates his kids . ”
29815	29825	29796	29797	My father	258	“ You dare to talk to me that way ? ”
29826	29835	29836	29836	His	258	“ Seeing as I just did , yes . ”

29976	30004	30005	30005	Iris	36	“ Thank you for coming . I wish we could stay longer and chat , but I want to introduce Declan to my cousin before she leaves . ”
30076	30081	30082	30082	She	36	“ A supply closet ? ”
30085	30100	30082	30082	She	36	“ I ’m sorry . It was the first unlocked door I could find . ”
30101	30107	30141	30141	Iris	36	“ Why are we hiding ? ”
30108	30140	30141	30141	Iris	36	“ Because you looked about two seconds away from blowing up on your father . I thought you might like the idea of getting away from everyone for a few minutes . ”
30165	30169	30157	30157	She	36	“ Thank you . ”
30223	30228	30209	30209	Iris	36	“ Tonight has been … ”
30229	30232	30233	30233	I	0	“ Excruciating , ”
30241	30259	30238	30238	She	36	“ If this is the dinner party , I can only imagine how the wedding will go . ”
30260	30271	30209	30209	Iris	36	“ You ’re the one who wanted a big wedding . ”
30272	30284	30320	30320	she	36	“ Only because my mother would kill me for excluding her . ”
30285	30302	30320	30320	she	36	“ Then let ’s elope and invite her along . She can be our sole witness . ”
30328	30333	30320	30320	she	36	“ You ’re serious . ”
30345	30367	30334	30334	I	0	“ We could spin it as a whirlwind idea . I could have us in Vegas in four hours or less . ”
30368	30386	30400	30400	She	36	“ We did not go through all this pain to give up right before the finish line . ”
30387	30399	30400	30400	She	36	“ It ’s not giving up . It ’s changing routes . ”
30488	30513	30475	30475	I	0	“ Think about it . You , me , and a drive - thru chapel . No press . No frills . No expectations . ”
30514	30520	30521	30521	she	36	“ The pinnacle of romance , ”
30539	30552	30553	30553	She	36	“ I ’ll throw in another hundred million to make it happen . ”
30583	30608	30609	30609	My	0	“ No amount of money can change my mind seeing as my mother would kill me before I have a chance to enjoy it . ”
30624	30641	30642	30642	Her	36	“ If it ’s any consolation , I hate the idea just as much as you . ”
30726	30748	30719	30719	I	0	“ Did you leave the light on in the supply closet again ? What did I tell you about wasting electricity ? ”
30764	30770	30759	30759	she	36	“ Tell me you locked — ”
30867	30872	30863	30863	them	601	“ I ’m sorry — ”
30873	30876	30877	30877	I	0	“ Leave , ”
30926	30934	30916	30916	Iris	36	“ Well , was n’t that fun ? ”
30978	30981	30962	30962	I	0	“ Hi . ”
30982	30989	30990	30990	I	0	“ Are you looking for Iris ? ”
30997	31006	30990	30990	I	0	“ I actually came to talk to you . ”
31020	31045	31016	31016	Her	603	“ I wo n’t take up more than a few minutes of your time . I know you ’re a busy man and everything . ”
31053	31059	31060	31060	I	0	“ Let ’s go outside . ”
31089	31100	31101	31101	She	603	“ Iris told me you hate these kinds of things . ”
31110	31117	31118	31118	She	603	“ Loathe is more like it . ”
31143	31153	31118	31118	She	603	“ How are you holding up with all this ? ”
31154	31175	31118	31118	She	603	“ As to be expected for an introvert who hates social gatherings , small talk , and people in general . ”
31176	31186	31118	31118	She	603	“ Then why do it in the first place ? ”
31187	31193	31194	31194	Her	603	“ Because it ’s expected . ”
31203	31216	31198	31198	she	603	“ It must be exhausting putting on an image for the public . ”
31217	31223	31118	31118	She	603	“ You have no idea . ”
31224	31257	31118	31118	She	603	“ I might not know what it is like to grow up in the public eye like you , but I understand having to put on a face for everyone around you . ”
31258	31262	31263	31263	I	0	“ You do ? ”
31278	31296	31270	31270	Her	603	“ I ’m sure Iris told you about my ex - husband and his very particular expectations . ”
31343	31397	31328	31328	She	36	“ When she told me she was getting married to you , I was excited that she finally met someone who could treat her right . Someone who could prove that love can heal the soul as much as it can destroy it . I ’ve heard the way she talks about you . ”
31407	31411	31412	31412	She	36	“ How so ? ”
31415	31469	31412	31412	She	36	“ It ’s obvious she admires you , and not just in a romantic way . Your work ethic . The love you have for your brothers . The way you gave her a chance to show her worth . For the last one , I ca n’t thank you enough . Truly . ”
31514	31583	31611	31611	Danish	95	“ But of course , like any mother , I worry about her and what the future holds for her . I do n’t want her to go through the kind of pain I experienced . I want a better life for her . One that I think you can provide , so long as you promise to always honor her and the vows you make this weekend . ”
31584	31601	31611	31611	Danish	95	“ I can assure you that I will always have Iris ’s best interests at heart . ”
31627	31632	31626	31626	IRIS	36	“ You look beautiful . ”
31829	31840	31826	31826	Mom	453	“ I ca n’t believe my baby is getting married . ”

31879	31898	31873	31873	she	453	“ It ’s hard not to . I always dreamed of you finding someone who made you happy . ”
31905	31909	31910	31910	She	453	“ You have ? ”
31913	31953	31910	31910	She	453	“ I was worried I made a bad impression on you when you were a child . That I let my bitterness toward your father get in the way of showing you how to move on despite the hurt . ”
31954	31957	31958	31958	I	0	“ Mom — ”
32056	32086	32047	32047	she	453	“ Not all men are like your father . It took me a long time to realize that , but I ’m glad you learned far quicker than me . ”
32087	32090	32091	32091	My	0	“ Right . ”
32112	32144	32104	32104	She	453	“ I ’m proud of you for finally opening up to someone . For risking your heart knowing all the possibilities — good and bad . You ’ve come so far . ”
32210	32230	32203	32203	Nana	62	“ Are we done with all the sad stuff now ? This is a wedding , not a funeral . ”
32823	32833	32813	32813	I	0	“ Relax . Just pretend they ’re not here , ”
32866	32871	32872	32872	I	0	“ Is everything okay ? ”

33362	33410	33347	33347	I	0	“ Declan , I give you this ring as a symbol of my promises to you , as your partner and friend . May it serve as a reminder that even during our hardest days , you can always count on me to stand by your side . ”
33560	33577	33547	33548	The priest	402	“ I pronounce you husband and wife . Declan , you may now kiss your bride . ”
33795	33818	33819	33819	Declan	402	“ That was hands down the worst kiss in my whole life , and that ’s saying something given my last ex — ”
34034	34039	34040	34040	His	35	“ They bought it . ”
34493	34500	34488	34488	I	0	“ Tell me what ’s wrong , ”
34524	34531	34532	34532	I	0	“ Why would anything be wrong ? ”
34535	34542	34532	34532	I	0	“ You do n’t look happy . ”
34543	34556	34557	34557	Her	36	“ Unlike you , some of us ca n’t fake it 24/7 . ”
34569	34575	34557	34557	Her	36	“ What are you talking — ”
34576	34592	34593	34594	the photographer	675	“ Let ’s get a photo of a kiss before they let the guests out ! ”
34619	34628	34629	34629	Iris	36	“ I think they ’re coming out now , ”
34633	34639	34640	34640	he	675	“ Then make it quick ! ”

35353	35364	35365	35365	I	0	“ Why did we agree to so many damn photos ? ”
35386	35407	35380	35380	Iris	36	“ Because we are going to share snapshots with the world to prove just how much we love one another . ”
35408	35414	35415	35415	She	36	“ Why should they care ? ”
35427	35444	35445	35445	I	0	“ Because you ’re a famous billionaire who is in the business of selling fairy tales . ”
35448	35453	35445	35445	I	0	“ Fame is temporary . ”
35454	35465	35466	35466	She	36	“ So is discomfort , so get used to it . ”

37616	37626	37613	37613	he	402	“ You ’re right . I feel absolutely scandalized , ”

38060	38080	38048	38048	He	720	“ You could n’t walk a straight line out the door in flats , let alone in those shoes . ”
38081	38084	38085	38085	His	720	“ Hmm . ”
38090	38093	38085	38085	His	720	“ What ? ”
38094	38103	38048	38048	He	720	“ Maybe you care about me after all . ”
38104	38111	38112	38112	I	0	“ That ’s the alcohol talking . ”
38115	38124	38112	38112	I	0	“ Jose does have a way with words . ”

38148	38152	38139	38139	I	0	“ Nobody important . ”
38153	38169	38139	38139	I	0	“ Good , then at least no one will miss him when he ’s dead . ”
38235	38244	38249	38249	him	896	“ Would it kill you to be gentle ? ”
38279	38288	38289	38289	I	0	“ I ’ll take that as a yes , ”

38404	38407	38398	38400	Declan ’s driver	756	“ Fine . ”
38451	38471	38472	38472	Declan	402	“ I forgot how fun a wedding could be . It ’s been years since I went to one . ”

38509	38543	38547	38547	his	402	“ I do n’t know why you do n’t like her . It ’s not her fault Rowan chose Dreamland over becoming CFO . You should give her a fair shot at least . ”
38572	38591	38592	38592	Declan	402	“ They invited us out to dinner tomorrow night and since we are n’t going on a honeymo — ”
38598	38608	38592	38592	Declan	402	“ We are not going to dinner with them . ”
38609	38643	38554	38554	he	402	“ But you ’ve barely spoken to Rowan since he decided to stay in Dreamland . I think it would be nice to spend some time with them while they ’re in town — ”
38644	38657	38658	38658	I	0	“ I do n’t pay you to be concerned over family matters . ”
38666	38677	38658	38658	I	0	“ Lucky for you I ’m doing this for free . ”
38688	38705	38658	38658	I	0	“ Do n’t bother . I ’m not going to dinner with Rowan and his girlfriend . ”
38706	38714	38554	38554	he	402	“ Zahra . Her name is Zahra . ”
38715	38729	38730	38730	I	0	“ Her name is as irrelevant as her relationship is with my brother . ”
38741	38753	38730	38730	I	0	“ God , your ability to hold a grudge is terrifying . ”
38754	38767	38658	38658	I	0	“ Consider it a lesson to not get on my bad side . ”
38768	38783	38658	38658	I	0	“ Lately it ’s starting to feel like every side is your bad side . ”

38807	38845	38799	38799	His	0	“ It ’s a wife ’s job to call you out on your bullshit because the rest of the world sure as hell wo n’t . Not when they ’re too afraid to speak up around you . ”
38846	38863	38864	38864	My	0	“ What part of we ’re not a real couple do you find difficult to understand ? ”
39116	39119	39120	39120	Declan	402	“ Iris , ”

39478	39481	39482	39482	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
39485	39491	39492	39492	I	0	“ Is it that bad ? ”
39498	39501	39492	39492	I	0	“ What ? ”
39502	39510	39511	39511	I	0	“ The idea of becoming my wife . ”
39527	39553	39554	39554	His	896	“ And you care about my opinion all of a sudden ? I ’m not sure you pay me enough for that kind of service . ”
39558	39563	39554	39554	His	896	“ Answer the question . ”

39592	39599	39600	39600	I	0	“ It ’s not an act . ”
39611	39635	39636	39636	His	896	“ Trust me . It might have taken me much longer than others , but I finally understand why everyone calls you that . ”
39643	39646	39636	39636	His	896	“ What ? ”
39647	39692	39636	39636	His	896	“ The way you treated me tonight — on our wedding night no less — is unacceptable . But I guess you could n’t care less about how or when you hurt other people ’s feelings , as long as you get your way . ”
39693	39701	39702	39702	I	0	“ What I said in the car — ”
39708	39730	39731	39731	His	896	“ Do n’t worry about it . It ’s my fault for setting unrealistic expectations about us in the first place . ”
39752	39764	39738	39738	I	0	“ I never did all of this for love . Obviously . ”
39775	39821	39822	39822	He	896	“ I only wanted to help you because I thought we were friends . And yes , before you say you never wanted to be my friend , I ’m aware it was probably stupid to think that . I ’ve since learned my lesson . ”
39833	39881	39822	39822	He	896	“ I realize I do n’t want to be your friend either . Because getting close to you means questioning your motives about everything , and frankly , that ’s way too much effort for someone who does n’t seem to like me in the first place . ”
40043	40046	40027	40027	I	0	“ Motherfucker . ”
40163	40171	40158	40158	I	0	“ Declan ! I need your help ! ”

40755	40769	40770	40771	Atta girl	107	“ Then do n’t walk around naked to begin with . Problem solved . ”
40848	40858	40859	40859	I	0	“ Oh my God . It ’s still alive ? ”
40873	40884	40885	40885	I	0	“ I can manage to take care of a cactus . ”

41083	41093	41037	41037	I	0	“ What if I cut you out of it ? ”
41094	41097	41056	41056	I	0	“ No ! ”

41146	41151	41128	41128	He	402	“ You ’re joking . ”
41152	41161	41128	41128	He	402	“ Would you prefer I rip it apart ? ”
41162	41166	41167	41167	I	0	“ Absolutely not ! ”

42904	42915	42936	42936	She	36	“ Because I need to talk to you about yesterday . ”

43520	43544	43545	43545	He	258	“ I find it to be a wasted effort . You hate me and I hate you , so why bother acting otherwise ? ”
43552	43559	43545	43545	He	258	“ I do n’t hate you . ”
43560	43571	43573	43573	I	0	“ I find that hard to believe given our past . ”
43584	43611	43573	43573	I	0	“ This is exactly why I respect you more than your brothers . Unlike Cal or Rowan , you are n’t afraid to speak your mind . ”
43612	43623	43545	43545	He	258	“ We both have two very different definitions of respect . ”
43624	43645	43545	43545	He	258	“ Regardless , I find your efforts admirable . It ’s why I consider you a threat to begin with . ”
43646	43657	43658	43658	He	0	“ Yet I ca n’t say the same about you . ”
43661	43674	43658	43658	He	0	“ I thought I taught you better than to underestimate your enemy . ”
43675	43688	43573	43573	I	0	“ Please . If anything , I give you too much credit . ”
43689	43733	43738	43738	me	0	“ You might be smart , but you let your need for revenge blind your ability to think clearly . Why else would you marry your assistant of all people ? Even I did n’t think you were that desperate for your inheritance . ”
43740	43762	43763	43763	I	0	“ Talk about her like that again and I swear I ’ll make your last twelve months as CEO absolutely miserable . ”
43840	43851	43852	43852	I	0	“ Do n’t tell me you actually care about her ? ”
43870	43884	43864	43864	He	809	“ To think I considered you my smartest son . What a disappointment . ”
43885	43907	43864	43864	He	809	“ Is there a point to this conversation or do you solely speak to hear the sound of your own voice ? ”
43908	43924	43925	43925	His	809	“ I ’m sure you ’re aware of why I asked you to come here . ”
43933	43950	43925	43925	His	809	“ You might have to explain yourself given how disappointing you find my intelligence to be . ”
43951	43961	43864	43864	He	809	“ Consider this a warning from father to son . ”
43962	43965	43925	43925	His	809	“ About ? ”
43966	44001	43925	43925	His	809	“ Your grandfather might have provided you with an opportunity to usurp me , but that does n’t mean you will be successful . I do n’t plan on stepping down without a fight . ”

44109	44126	44127	44127	She	36	“ No . Pick a place . Any place with running water and Wi - Fi . ”
44137	44144	44127	44127	She	36	“ Searching for a hidden camera ? ”
44152	44188	44127	44127	She	36	“ Either that or a wiretap . Just to be clear , I have never nor will I ever take drugs . Whatever green substance you might find in my room is definitely Cal ’s . ”
44189	44192	44193	44193	I	0	“ Funny , ”
44197	44203	44204	44204	she	36	“ Do you ever laugh ? ”
44207	44215	44216	44216	Her	36	“ Only when I make people cry . ”
44228	44238	44220	44220	she	36	“ Cal is right . You are a monster . ”
44239	44258	44220	44220	she	36	“ A monster who expects you to have a honeymoon chosen by the end of the business day . ”
44259	44265	44266	44266	She	36	“ A honeymoon ? Wow ! ”
44278	44291	44266	44266	She	36	“ Do n’t get any ideas . This is strictly for appearances . ”
44292	44295	44296	44296	Her	36	“ Appearances ? ”
44302	44331	44332	44332	Her	36	“ I ’m positive that my father will do everything in his power to delegitimize our marriage . It is up to us to make his attempt futile . ”
44336	44351	44332	44332	Her	36	“ By going on a honeymoon ? How is that going to solve anything ? ”
44352	44370	44371	44371	She	36	“ It proves I care enough about you to take my first vacation in over a decade . ”
44374	44397	44371	44371	She	36	“ You must live such a sad life if you think sacrificing work for a honeymoon is a declaration of your affection . ”
44398	44403	44405	44405	she	36	“ Is it not ? ”
44436	44443	44444	44444	I	0	“ No . It ’s not . ”
44447	44456	44457	44457	Her	36	“ I ’ll be the judge of that . ”
44461	44482	44483	44483	She	36	“ Sure . We can do things your way since you have so much experience when it comes to relationships . ”
44505	44512	44497	44497	I	0	“ Book the plane for Friday . ”
44513	44517	44483	44483	She	36	“ This Friday ? ”
44518	44527	44528	44528	She	36	“ Is that going to be a problem ? ”
44531	44559	44528	44528	She	36	“ No ! Even if it was , I refuse to let this golden opportunity go to waste . I have n’t had a vacation in years . ”
44560	44574	44575	44575	She	36	“ At least you finally get something good out of all of this . ”
44584	44604	44575	44575	She	36	“ You mean there ’s supposed to be something better than marrying you ? I refuse to believe it . ”
44708	44714	44715	44715	he	402	“ Money is no object , ”
44734	44739	44740	44740	he	402	“ Keep it down , ”
44872	44875	44876	44876	I	0	“ No . ”
44884	44891	44892	44892	Cal	720	“ But it ’s Bora Bora , ”
44904	44908	44899	44899	I	0	“ Sounds boring . ”
44924	44931	44911	44911	Cal	720	“ What is wrong with you ? ”
45018	45023	45024	45024	I	0	“ How about Maui ? ”
45029	45032	45024	45024	I	0	“ No . ”
45033	45036	44997	44997	Cal	720	“ Fiji ? ”
45037	45040	45024	45024	I	0	“ Pass . ”
45041	45068	45024	45024	I	0	“ I swear , with the way you ’re acting , it ’s as if you do n’t want to go on a honeymoon at all . ”
45069	45073	44997	44997	Cal	720	“ I do ! ”
45092	45098	45087	45087	He	720	“ What about South Africa ? ”
45107	45112	45113	45113	He	720	“ Tell me more . ”
45121	45137	45113	45113	He	720	“ You ca n’t be serious . You would choose a safari over Bora Bora ? ”
45138	45142	45151	45151	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
45143	45150	45151	45151	I	0	“ Because it ’s not romantic . ”
45154	45170	45151	45151	I	0	“ This might be a honeymoon , but it is n’t meant to be romantic . ”
45171	45182	45185	45185	Cal	720	“ Clearly or else you would have chosen something else . ”
45257	45269	45270	45270	Cal	720	“ That ’s it . We ’re going to South Africa . ”
45536	45541	45526	45526	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
45552	45570	45542	45542	Declan	402	“ Nothing . Just thinking about how I need to finish packing for both of us tonight . ”
45596	45611	45612	45612	I	0	“ Is there anything in particular that you want me to pack for you ? ”
45615	45618	45619	45619	He	402	“ No . ”
45914	45942	45943	45943	She	838	“ Sir , I ’m here to service you in any way you need . Please do n’t hesitate to ask for anything during the long flight . ”
45992	45996	45997	45997	She	838	“ Excuse me ? ”
46007	46029	45997	45997	She	838	“ The captain said the trip should be a smooth one . I ’m curious what made you pick South Africa ? ”
46030	46041	46051	46051	She	838	“ I ’ve always wanted to go on a safari . ”
46086	46100	46075	46075	He	258	“ My husband and I will take two glasses of champagne , please . ”
46136	46140	46126	46126	She	838	“ Excuse me ? ”
46150	46170	46144	46144	I	0	“ Actually , you might as well bring out the whole bottle . We ’re in a celebrating mood . ”
46171	46176	46177	46177	Her	838	“ You ’re married ? ”
46201	46209	46210	46210	Declan	402	“ Get my wife whatever she wants . ”
46234	46243	46244	46244	She	838	“ Of course . Right away , sir ! ”
46254	46260	46244	46244	She	838	“ Right away , sir ! ”
46293	46299	46290	46290	I	0	“ Are you enjoying yourself ? ”
46300	46308	46280	46280	he	402	“ I do find your possessiveness entertaining . ”
46309	46315	46280	46280	he	402	“ I am not possessive . ”
46316	46319	46320	46320	he	402	“ Hmm , ”
46353	46382	46333	46333	I	0	“ Okay , whatever . Even if I was , it ’s warranted . She should n’t have flirted with you while you ’re wearing a wedding ring . ”
46383	46387	46388	46388	He	402	“ I see . ”
46403	46410	46388	46388	He	402	“ What are n’t you saying ? ”
46411	46430	46431	46431	My	0	“ I ’m curious why you feel the need to flaunt your marital status whenever you ’re insecure . ”
46436	46442	46431	46431	My	0	“ I am not insecure ! ”
46443	46452	46454	46454	he	402	“ I ’m aware of your trust issues . ”
46482	46500	46501	46501	I	0	“ Is this the part of our relationship where we share our deep - seated daddy issues ? ”
46515	46535	46536	46536	He	402	“ Because I ’m pretty sure we could spend the whole flight debating who had it worse growing up . ”
46539	46544	46536	46536	He	402	“ Defensive as always . ”
46661	46670	46653	46653	He	402	“ You can trust me to remain faithful . ”
46671	46679	46680	46680	I	0	“ As if that was a concern , ”
46691	46699	46684	46684	His	402	“ Everyone knows about your sleeping habits . ”
46700	46706	46707	46707	His	402	“ And what are they ? ”
46713	46749	46707	46707	His	402	“ You do n’t sleep around and you do n’t date . Half the company thinks you ’re gay while the others think you visit a sex club to let off some steam every week . ”
46750	46760	46766	46766	his	402	“ I ’m disappointed at their lack of creativity . ”
46776	46805	46766	46766	his	402	“ I tried to help them all by spreading a rumor about a woman who secretly visited your office on Fridays , but it only lasted a year . ”
46806	46815	46816	46816	His	402	“ Why the hell would you say that ? ”
46872	46926	46927	46927	He	402	“ It forced people to send me their assignments earlier than usual because no one wanted to interrupt your sexy time for a signature . It was a win - win really . I was able to prepare your Monday briefing reports before the weekend and they earned promotions for their diligent work . ”
46932	46942	46927	46927	He	402	“ You had them believe this for a year ? ”
46943	46950	46927	46927	He	402	“ Are you proud of me ? ”
46951	46954	46927	46927	He	402	“ No . ”
46955	46981	46982	46982	I	0	“ You should be . I was so committed to the storyline that I even hired a few women to leave your office at 5 p.m. ”
46987	47001	47002	47002	I	0	“ Please tell me you did n’t charge this to my personal card . ”
47005	47014	47015	47015	He	402	“ Nope . Considered it a business expense . ”
47020	47043	47015	47015	He	402	“ Sometimes I feel like I know everything about you , and then you open your mouth and say something like that . ”
47056	47062	47048	47048	I	0	“ Keeping tabs on me ? ”
47063	47068	47093	47093	She	838	“ It ’s expected . ”
47069	47076	47077	47077	His	402	“ Because I ’m your wife ? ”
47123	47128	47129	47129	Her	838	“ I got it . ”
47143	47150	47133	47133	she	838	“ Jealousy looks good on you . ”
47151	47157	47158	47158	I	0	“ Oh , shut up . ”
47208	47216	47217	47217	He	402	“ To the vacation I desperately needed . ”
47223	47231	47217	47217	He	402	“ And the honeymoon I never wanted . ”
47239	47242	47217	47217	He	402	“ Cheers ! ”
47584	47600	47601	47601	He	402	“ You ca n’t go out like that . The lions will eat you alive . ”
47621	47634	47613	47613	I	0	“ We ’re supposed to meet with the ranger in five minu — ”
47635	47645	47646	47647	a woman	660	“ Sorry , Mr. Kane , what was that ? ”
47667	47682	47683	47683	Tanaka	117	“ Just my assistant checking in on me . Carry on , Ms. Tanaka . ”
47933	47940	47922	47922	I	0	“ Here . Change into this . ”
47941	47947	47948	47948	I	0	“ We ’re not going . ”
47953	47960	47961	47961	His	402	“ I ’m sorry , what ? ”
47980	47996	47961	47961	His	402	“ Mr. Yakura wants to meet in a few hours to discuss the latest proposal . ”
47997	48002	47961	47961	His	402	“ You ’re joking . ”
48003	48030	47961	47961	His	402	“ No . The man is impossible . I ’m close to abandoning the land and sending the scouts out to find me a new location . ”
48031	48034	48035	48035	He	402	“ But — ”
48042	48073	48074	48074	He	402	“ I refuse to give up when I ’m this close to securing the deal , especially after I promised the board I would follow through on delivering Dreamland Tokyo . ”
48103	48113	48098	48098	I	0	“ I do n’t think I ’m understanding you . ”
48114	48135	48098	48098	I	0	“ He finally gave me some concrete feedback about my proposal and would like to meet to discuss it further — ”
48136	48145	48146	48146	I	0	“ I ’m not talking about the proposal ! ”
48170	48175	48164	48164	Declan	402	“ You ’re upset . ”
48176	48185	48098	48098	I	0	“ No , Declan . I ’m disappointed . ”
48186	48200	48201	48201	I	0	“ You of all people should understand how important this is to me . ”
48209	48228	48201	48201	I	0	“ That ’s exactly my problem . I understand your needs even at the expense of my own . ”
48250	48258	48201	48201	I	0	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
48259	48287	48288	48288	I	0	“ I ’ve spent three years of my life making sure you ’re taken care of , even if it meant sacrificing my happiness to do so , ”
48319	48323	48313	48313	his	402	“ Never mind — ”
48324	48332	48333	48333	he	402	“ Is that how you really feel ? ”
48349	48352	48313	48313	his	402	“ Yes . ”
48353	48356	48357	48357	His	402	“ Why ? ”
48539	48572	48573	48573	His	402	“ Forget it . I ’m being extra grumpy from jet lag and waking up earlier than usual for our safari . It ’s nothing a cup of coffee ca n’t fix . ”
48578	48581	48573	48573	His	402	“ Listen — ”
48582	48587	48600	48600	he	402	“ It ’s fine . ”
48588	48594	48600	48600	he	402	“ I did n’t expect — ”
48606	48615	48600	48600	he	402	“ You better get that . Sounds important . ”
49606	49609	49610	49610	Her	36	“ Ready ? ”
49624	49627	49610	49610	Her	36	“ Yup . ”

49700	49715	49716	49716	She	36	“ Tell me what ’s wrong so we can get on with our day . ”
49735	49742	49716	49716	She	36	“ Why would anything be wrong ? ”
49743	49755	49756	49756	I	0	“ Quit the passive - aggressive attitude and talk to me . ”
49768	49782	49783	49783	Her	36	“ You ’re the last person I want to speak to right now . ”

49887	49890	49871	49871	My	0	“ No . ”
49891	49898	49899	49899	Her	36	“ You ’re a pathetic liar . ”
49912	49920	49903	49903	She	36	“ You want me to be honest ? ”
49927	49930	49921	49921	Her	36	“ Yes . ”
49931	49942	49871	49871	My	0	“ Even if you hate what I have to say ? ”
49943	49953	49921	49921	Her	36	“ I can assure you I ’ve heard worse . ”
49968	49974	49964	49964	her	36	“ Do n’t do that . ”
49975	49982	49921	49921	Her	36	“ Do n’t do what exactly ? ”
49983	50001	49871	49871	My	0	“ Do n’t remind me that there ’s a human being locked up inside of you somewhere . ”
50002	50011	50012	50012	Her	36	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
50029	50032	50019	50019	she	36	“ I — ”
50051	50060	50044	50044	Her	36	“ I ’ll leave you to it then . ”
50127	50135	50136	50136	I	0	“ We ’ll continue this conversation after . ”
50143	50149	50150	50150	Her	36	“ Of course , sir . ”
50168	50173	50157	50157	She	36	“ Hello , hello ! ”
50263	50272	50255	50255	everyone	206	“ No need to smile on my account . ”
50276	50284	50273	50273	Yakura	35	“ Good . It ’s not natural . ”
50309	50314	50298	50298	His	35	“ Where ’s Iris ? ”
50325	50328	50318	50318	he	35	“ Here ! ”
50376	50381	50363	50363	I	0	“ How are you ? ”
50439	50464	50430	50430	Her	36	“ Everything is great . Same old , same old over here . Just busy working my life away one day at a time . ”
50479	50496	50497	50497	He	35	“ Sounds like you need a vacation . Perhaps even a honeymoon from what I hear . ”
50513	50522	50509	50509	she	36	“ I see you heard about our news . ”
50523	50545	50546	50546	He	35	“ I ’m a bit offended I found out the big news from my wife . I thought we were friends . ”
50597	50625	50626	50626	Iris	36	“ I sent a wedding e - invitation to your assistant since everything was such a whirlwind , but it must have not made it to you . ”
50644	50670	50671	50671	She	36	“ She must have missed it . I get so many emails each day , I practically take up a whole cloud of storage space . ”
50676	50688	50689	50689	Iris	36	“ No worries . It was spur of the moment anyway . ”
50725	50757	50708	50708	I	0	“ I ’d say . I never knew you two were together , although my wife had her suspicions . Part of me is annoyed she was right this entire time . ”
50758	50766	50767	50767	Iris	36	“ Your wife is a smart woman , ”
50770	50783	50767	50767	Iris	36	“ How did you two keep it a secret for this long ? ”
50784	50799	50708	50708	I	0	“ You know Declan . He always keeps his business and personal life separate . ”
50800	50821	50833	50833	she	36	“ Do n’t I know it . He would n’t even tell me his favorite color when I asked him . ”
50822	50832	50833	50833	she	36	“ Green like a crisp hundred - dollar bill , ”
50849	50854	50860	50860	he	35	“ Is that right ? ”
50865	50868	50860	50860	he	35	“ Yes . ”
50962	50999	50960	50960	her	36	“ Well , I wo n’t take up too much of your time . But while I have both of you here , I would like to discuss a unique opportunity regarding the Dreamland Tokyo proposal . ”
51023	51038	51016	51016	I	0	“ I would like to move forward with the project on a few conditions . ”
51090	51111	51112	51112	He	893	“ Fantastic . The Kane Company would be excited to work with you and turn Dreamland Tokyo into a reality . ”
51115	51143	51112	51112	He	893	“ I am excited as well . But I would like you to iron out a few last details before I present the deal to the board . ”
51144	51152	51153	51153	I	0	“ Of course . Whatever you need , ”

51468	51478	51426	51426	her	36	“ I did n’t know that was your thing . ”
51479	51482	51449	51449	Her	36	“ Murder ? ”

51504	51508	51449	51449	Her	36	“ No flirting . ”
51509	51522	51487	51487	Her	36	“ Interesting . Are we just adding rules as we go now ? ”
51523	51540	51449	51449	Her	36	“ Yes , seeing as there is no how - to manual on faking a marriage . ”

51596	51616	51582	51582	She	36	“ I find it fascinating how you can say that with a straight face given how you treat everyone . ”
51624	51634	51635	51635	She	36	“ I do n’t treat you like everyone else . ”

51682	51733	51679	51679	She	36	“ There are moments you treat me great . I ’d be stupid to deny that . But there are plenty of times when I feel like I do n’t matter . That my needs are merely collateral damage in your pursuit of whatever you think will make you happy . ”
51763	51767	51753	51753	I	0	“ I see . ”
51768	51774	51775	51775	She	36	“ You really do n’t . ”

51810	51853	51802	51802	She	36	“ I do n’t know what I thought honestly , but I ’m mad at myself for being surprised that all this even happened . I ’m even more disappointed that I thought your work would only be kept to one day . ”
51877	51880	51881	51881	She	36	“ Iris … ”

53748	53762	53781	53781	I	0	“ You might have to clarify because I said a lot of things . ”

I have no life , no friends other than Cal , and no future besides helping you accomplish yours . I married you despite all the red flags , and I ’m supposed to give birth to a child knowing full well you want nothing to do with them . Of course I ’m not happy . In fact , I ’m terrified . ”

54208	54287	54201	54201	I	0	“ I ’m serious . That means you respect my time , energy , and willingness to go above and beyond to make our fake marriage work . You need to remember that this is n’t for me . You are the one who screwed up a perfectly good wedding contract with Bethany , and I ’m the next best thing . I can be your asset or your enemy . It ’s up to you to decide . ”

54321	54390	54391	54391	He	402	“ Yes , actually . There is one more thing . Stop calling Dreamland Tokyo your project . We both have spent two years working on that proposal together , and I lost about ten friends and a boyfriend in the process , so whether you like it or not , we ’re a team . I ’d like to be treated as such from this moment on . ”
54397	54404	54405	54405	I	0	“ That ’s a valid point . ”

54907	54933	54896	54896	He	402	“ No need to thank me . Offering you caffeine is solely for my personal benefit . It tends to make you much more compliant . ”
54938	54942	54943	54943	He	402	“ Excuse me ? ”
54955	54965	54950	54950	he	402	“ Someone is mighty eager to get going today , ”

55170	55190	55191	55191	Declan	402	“ It ’s a vacation , not a doctor ’s appointment . They can wait a few minutes longer . ”

55392	55396	55397	55397	He	402	“ A truce ? ”
55405	55448	55402	55402	I	0	“ Let ’s spend a day pretending the rest of the world does n’t exist . No work . No Yakura . No regrets . Give me one single day of your time without any of the other stuff bogging us down . ”
55449	55458	55377	55377	I	0	“ What do I get out of this ? ”
55468	55484	55377	55377	I	0	“ You get a happy wife who wo n’t suffocate you in your sleep tonight . ”

55499	55513	55514	55514	He	402	“ Depends on what true crime episode I ’m inspired by that night . ”
55565	55583	55584	55584	he	402	“ Fine . But only because I do n’t think you would survive a day in jail , ”
55587	55599	55584	55584	he	402	“ You ’re right . Orange is so not my color . ”
55675	55683	55670	55670	they	944	“ Are we the first ones here ? ”

55991	56010	55988	55988	He	952	“ Of course . We do our best to find the leopards , but they ’re cunning creatures . ”

56112	56147	56148	56148	He	951	“ Come on . I know it was a long time ago , but think back to your childhood . There had to be at least one animal you liked more than the rest . ”
56155	56158	56148	56148	He	951	“ Elephants . ”
56159	56162	56163	56163	His	951	“ Elephants ? ”

57894	57912	57889	57889	He	402	“ We ’re not going out in a storm like that , regardless of what they say . ”
57913	57916	57889	57889	He	402	“ But — ”
57917	57920	57889	57889	He	402	“ No . ”
57924	57940	57941	57941	Lightning	129	“ It ’s a summer shower . It ’ll be gone before you know it . ”
57963	57970	57953	57953	He	402	“ Fine . You ’re right . ”
57980	57995	57996	57996	His	0	“ You ’re giving up already ? At least make me work for it . ”
58022	58047	58053	58053	his	0	“ Part of me thinks you like picking fights with me because it ’s the only way you know how to keep me around . ”
58056	58063	58053	58053	his	0	“ Why would I want that ? ”
58064	58074	58053	58053	his	0	“ Because I think you like talking to me . ”
58075	58087	58053	58053	his	0	“ Is anyone else aware of what a narcissist you are ? ”
58088	58102	58103	58103	He	0	“ I ’m surprised you noticed with how obsessed you are with yourself . ”
58153	58163	58141	58141	my	0	“ Admit it . You like hanging around me . ”
58176	58184	58171	58171	His	0	“ I do n’t exactly hate it . ”
58185	58198	58199	58199	He	0	“ Coming from you , that ’s practically a declaration of love . ”
58235	58253	58254	58254	I	0	“ Well , this is my sign to go jump in front of the nearest moving vehicle . ”
58273	58282	58283	58283	His	0	“ What do you plan on doing today ? ”
58296	58302	58288	58288	I	0	“ Why are you asking ? ”
58303	58308	58283	58283	His	0	“ I ’m curious . ”
58309	58321	58322	58322	You	989	“ I doubt you ’re interested in whatever I have planned . ”

58381	58386	58350	58350	I	0	“ Sounds absolutely riveting . ”
58416	58449	58452	58452	him	402	“ At least you can spend the day catching up on work . I ’m sure it kills you to be away from your computer for more than twenty - four hours . ”
58513	58519	58520	58520	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
58523	58527	58520	58520	I	0	“ An experiment . ”
58528	58531	58532	58532	I	0	“ Pardon ? ”
58538	58559	58532	58532	I	0	“ I want to see just how many hours it takes before your brain melts . Strictly for scientific purposes . ”
58582	58589	58565	58565	he	402	“ You want to join me ? ”
58590	58598	58561	58562	my God	219	“ I have nothing better to do . ”
58859	58874	58849	58849	He	402	“ You do n’t have to stick around if you do n’t want to , ”
58934	58938	58939	58939	he	402	“ Another one ? ”
59017	59026	59007	59007	I	0	“ Do you have a problem with that ? ”
59027	59044	59007	59007	I	0	“ You ’ve watched eight episodes in a row of them doing the same exact thing . ”
59045	59058	59059	59059	I	0	“ And I could watch another eight more without ever getting bored . ”
59106	59109	59110	59110	he	402	“ Why ? ”
59113	59120	59110	59110	he	402	“ Because I ’m getting inspired . ”
59126	59140	59121	59121	His	402	“ Do n’t tell me you actually want to do this one day ? ”
59141	59154	59121	59121	His	402	“ Of course I do . It looks like so much fun ! ”
59182	59194	59200	59200	his	402	“ They found a family of mice in the last home . ”
59207	59217	59200	59200	his	402	“ Nothing adopting a feral cat ca n’t fix . ”
59218	59225	59226	59226	His	402	“ I ’m allergic to cats . ”
59230	59243	59226	59226	His	402	“ Good thing you do n’t have to worry about that then . ”
59244	59248	59249	59249	His	402	“ Why not ? ”
59264	59285	59253	59253	I	0	“ Because it ’s going to be my house . If I want a pet cat , so be it . ”
59286	59296	59297	59297	His	402	“ Is my house not good enough for you ? ”
59329	59344	59319	59319	his	402	“ Of course your house is good enough . For now , at least . ”
59345	59349	59350	59350	he	402	“ For now , ”
59358	59371	59350	59350	he	402	“ It ’s not like we planned on me living there forever . ”
59372	59377	59319	59319	his	402	“ I know that . ”
59378	59386	59387	59387	I	0	“ You have a very nice house , ”
59390	59395	59396	59396	he	402	“ Not nice enough , ”
59462	59474	59454	59454	I	0	“ It ’s just that … it ’s not my style . ”
59475	59487	59488	59488	My	0	“ And what exactly is your style then ? A forest ? ”
59498	59501	59492	59492	I	0	“ No . ”
59502	59509	59454	59454	I	0	“ Then what ’s the issue ? ”
59510	59542	59543	59543	He	402	“ Your place is empty , cold , and devoid of any kind of personality . It might be a house , but it ’s the furthest thing from a home . ”
59549	59555	59543	59543	He	402	“ That makes no sense . ”
59556	59563	59573	59573	I	0	“ Let me try to explain . ”
59564	59572	59573	59573	I	0	“ By all means , please do . ”
59633	59644	59645	59645	I	0	“ My parents ’ divorce was n’t the most conventional . ”
59669	59692	59661	59661	I	0	“ My father — if you can even call him that — was not a good guy . He was … mean . ”
59724	59731	59732	59732	I	0	“ Was he mean to you ? ”
59735	59750	59732	59732	I	0	“ Yes . But not nearly as bad as he was to my mom . ”
59761	59767	59751	59751	His	402	“ Do n’t do that . ”
59773	59777	59751	59751	His	402	“ Do what ? ”
59778	59791	59792	59792	I	0	“ Downplay your experience because someone else had it harder than you . ”
59914	59978	59894	59894	I	0	“ Anyway … my mom and I moved out of my childhood house with two suitcases and a thick wad of cash she spent a whole year saving up . She tried her hardest to sell me on the idea of moving into a shoebox apartment with Nana . I spent a whole week crying , telling her I wanted to go home . ”
59979	59984	59985	59985	He	1004	“ What happened next ? ”
60003	60037	60038	60038	I	0	“ She taught me how anyone can buy a house , but not everyone can buy a home . With a house , you can buy it , sell it , renovate it . ”
60044	60078	60038	60038	I	0	“ But a home is more abstract . It ’s not a place , but a feeling I ca n’t describe , so you ’ll just have to take my word for it . ”
60079	60083	60084	60084	he	1004	“ A feeling , ”
60092	60105	60106	60106	He	1004	“ You know , those pesky emotions you turned off ages ago ? ”
60109	60121	60122	60122	I	0	“ That sounds like the biggest bullshit I ’ve ever heard . ”
60125	60134	60122	60122	I	0	“ I knew you would n’t get it . ”
60149	60159	60160	60160	I	0	“ Only because you ’re terrible at describing things . ”
60163	60177	60160	60160	I	0	“ Like I said , you ’ll know it when you feel it . ”
60266	60269	60270	60270	Someone	131	“ Hey . ”
60275	60282	60270	60270	Someone	131	“ Ugh . Let me sleep . ”
60298	60311	60294	60294	Declan	402	“ There ’s something outside you ’re going to want to see . ”
60312	60315	60316	60316	I	0	“ Shh . ”
60350	60377	60333	60333	I	0	“ This might be your one and only chance to see a leopard , so if I were you , I ’d get up . Now . ”
60378	60381	60382	60382	I	0	“ What ? ”
60424	60428	60429	60429	He	402	“ Follow me . ”
60469	60483	60457	60457	Declan	402	“ This better not be some ploy to get me into your room . ”
60503	60508	60457	60457	Declan	402	“ I ’m joking . ”
60509	60522	60495	60495	he	402	“ Good because I have no interest in doing such a thing . ”
60538	60545	60527	60527	He	402	“ Then why are we here ? ”
60546	60562	60563	60563	He	402	“ I was in the middle of taking a shower when I noticed something outside . ”
60632	60643	60644	60644	I	0	“ Why is there so much water on the floor ? ”
60660	60667	60668	60668	He	402	“ I was in a rush . ”
60771	60776	60777	60777	He	402	“ Look over there . ”
60783	60790	60777	60777	He	402	“ What am I looking for ? ”
60791	60798	60799	60799	He	402	“ You do n’t see it ? ”
60808	60814	60815	60815	He	402	“ It ’s pitch black . ”
60820	60834	60815	60815	He	402	“ Right there . Between the two trees in front of the river . ”
60847	60850	60851	60851	He	402	“ Nope . ”
60865	60869	60851	60851	He	402	“ Right there . ”
60870	60875	60876	60876	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
60889	60895	60876	60876	I	0	“ It ’s a leopard ! ”
60896	60899	60851	60851	He	402	“ Shh . ”
60929	60943	60876	60876	I	0	“ How did you even see it ? It ’s so dark outside . ”
60944	60987	60876	60876	I	0	“ It set off the motion - censored spotlight . I thought it would run away before I had a chance to come get you , but it seemed more curious than anything . Probably it was thirsty enough to stick around . ”
60988	60993	60994	60994	I	0	“ Or hungry enough . ”
61072	61079	61080	61080	he	402	“ Did it meet your expectations ? ”
61091	61094	61080	61080	he	402	“ Yes ! ”
61104	61110	61111	61111	His	402	“ Thank you for remembering . ”
61157	61174	61152	61152	He	785	“ We should get to sleep . It ’s going to be a long day tomorrow . ”
61186	61192	61152	61152	He	785	“ Right . Of course . ”
61241	61249	61250	61250	He	785	“ Thanks again . For all this . ”
61307	61316	61288	61288	I	0	“ Please tell me you ’re not pregnant . ”
61317	61331	61332	61332	I	0	“ I ’m sorry ? Did you just ask if I ’m pregnant ? ”
61345	61348	61332	61332	I	0	“ Yes . ”
61349	61353	61354	61354	I	0	“ Why ? ! ”
61374	61380	61381	61381	Mom	453	“ You do n’t know . ”
61402	61406	61391	61391	I	0	“ What happened ? ”
61407	61417	61459	61459	Acid	132	“ There are … stories coming out about you . ”
61418	61421	61391	61391	I	0	“ Me ? ”
61422	61426	61427	61427	My	0	“ And Declan . ”
61431	61437	61438	61438	She	453	“ Send them to me . ”
61443	61456	61438	61438	She	453	“ I think it ’s better if you do n’t see them . ”
61597	61604	61593	61593	My	0	“ None of this is true . ”
61630	61660	61623	61623	Mom	453	“ Obviously not . I ’ve seen the way you two interact . These soulless people are just looking to ruin anyone so they can sell a few copies . ”
61687	61695	61696	61696	My	0	“ What am I supposed to do ? ”
61700	61705	61706	61706	Mom	453	“ My poor baby . ”
61711	61731	61732	61732	Her	453	“ I hate that they ’re saying these things about you . Them calling you a money - hungry … ”
61815	61825	61826	61826	Mom	453	“ Do n’t let these people get to you . ”
61845	61855	61856	61856	I	0	“ It ’s a little too late for that , ”
61859	61866	61856	61856	I	0	“ They ’re nothing but rumors . ”
61867	61881	61882	61882	I	0	“ Except everyone is talking about my marriage , including freaking Finance Today . ”
61900	61918	61921	61921	Mom	453	“ They can say anything they want , but that does n’t make any of it true . ”
61928	61931	61921	61921	Mom	453	“ But — ”
61932	61970	61971	61971	Me	0	“ No buts . These reporters will come up with any kind of story to sell some papers . It ’s disgusting that they would come after your marriage like this , but I ’m not surprised . ”
62177	62185	62186	62186	I	0	“ I ’m going to fix this . ”
62192	62195	62186	62186	I	0	“ How ? ”
62206	62220	62186	62186	I	0	“ I do n’t know yet , but I ’ll figure it out . ”
62221	62259	62260	62260	Mom	453	“ Oh , baby . You ca n’t change people ’s narratives . They are going to think what they want based on the facts they ’re presented with , and nothing you do will change that . ”
62742	62750	62751	62751	Iris	36	“ Call my lawyer when we land . ”
62758	62762	62751	62751	Iris	36	“ What for ? ”
62763	62774	62796	62796	She	36	“ I ’m in the mood to make people miserable . ”
62775	62792	62793	62793	I	0	“ Can it still be considered a mood if it ’s a constant state of being ? ”
62804	62809	62796	62796	She	36	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
62810	62824	62825	62825	Her	36	“ I ’m about to slap half of Chicago with a libel lawsuit . ”
62837	62850	62851	62851	I	0	“ Ahh . So I take it that you saw the articles ? ”
62854	62860	62861	62861	She	36	“ You know about them ? ”
62877	62887	62888	62888	Her	36	“ And you did n’t think to tell me ? ”
62901	62942	62888	62888	Her	36	“ My mom called me while I was packing this morning and told me about them . I was hoping we would make it through the flight before you read them , but I see it was a lost cause . ”
62943	62956	62888	62888	Her	36	“ Why did n’t you tell me the moment you saw them ? ”
62968	62986	62888	62888	Her	36	“ Because I did n't find it worth ruining our last day together with something like this . ”
62987	62995	62996	62996	She	36	“ Who the fuck cares about that ? ”
63003	63030	63031	63031	Us	1054	“ If you ’re worried about what the lawyer might think , I already have a plan . I refuse to let your father beat us . ”
63066	63083	63084	63084	She	36	“ Fuck the plan and fuck my father . That ’s not what ’s important here . ”
63089	63102	63084	63084	She	36	“ My , my , Declan . Are you offended for me ? ”
63103	63113	63114	63114	My	0	“ They called you a money - hungry whore . ”
63119	63153	63114	63114	My	0	“ At least they chose a good photo of me for that one . The reporters over at the Chicago Chronicle were n’t as kind when it came to my secret pregnancy announcement . ”
63154	63157	63158	63158	I	0	“ What ? ”
63184	63191	63177	63177	Iris	36	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
63309	63315	63294	63294	She	36	“ They ’re only words . ”
63341	63350	63326	63326	I	0	“ I expected a different reaction from you . ”
63387	63397	63398	63398	She	36	“ I knew all of this would happen eventually . ”
63456	63462	63463	63463	She	36	“ I ’ll handle this . ”
63468	63480	63463	63463	She	36	“ What are you going to do ? Defend my honor ? ”
63481	63487	63488	63488	Her	36	“ At the very least . ”
63499	63511	63488	63488	Her	36	“ Please do n’t do something stupid because you ’re angry . ”
63512	63517	63518	63518	She	36	“ I wo n’t . ”
63523	63533	63518	63518	She	36	“ Or anything that could be deemed a felony . ”
63534	63548	63549	63549	Her	36	“ Is it still considered a crime if I do n’t get caught ? ”
63563	63578	63549	63549	Her	36	“ Paying your way out of prison is n’t something to show off about . ”
63579	63595	63518	63518	She	36	“ What good is having all this money if I have to follow the law ? ”
63596	63616	63518	63518	She	36	“ There are so many things wrong with that statement , I do n’t even know where to start . ”
63617	63622	63623	63623	Her	36	“ Then do n’t . ”
63627	63659	63623	63623	Her	36	“ Moving on . We need to be strategic about all of this . I ’m sure your grandfather ’s lawyer is starting to become suspicious about the legitimacy of everything . ”

63730	63750	63719	63719	She	36	“ Right . Well , regardless of your current opinion on the matter , I have the perfect plan . ”
63939	63949	63934	63934	He	258	“ Perfect timing . Tell your bitch to heel . ”
64016	64020	64002	64002	He	258	“ You fucking — ”
64042	64045	64036	64036	Iris	36	“ Ow . ”
64121	64129	64130	64130	Iris	36	“ That does n’t feel too good — ”
64141	64157	64133	64133	she	36	“ That ’s what you get for thinking you could lay a hand on me . ”
64167	64186	64160	64161	this man	36	“ Oh , I ’d like to lay more than a hand on you , you evil fucker . ”
64200	64206	64207	64207	I	0	“ I ’ll handle this . ”
64225	64264	64220	64220	she	36	“ I was coming here to check in on Iris and see how she was holding up after those articles came out . I ’m sure it ca n’t be easy being referred to as a mindless slut — ”
64332	64344	64319	64319	He	258	“ Looks like you ’re more like me than I thought . ”
64351	64355	64319	64319	He	258	“ Get out ! ”
64429	64440	64426	64426	Iris	36	“ Well , that did n’t go exactly as expected . ”
64464	64480	64481	64481	She	36	“ Please tell me that was n’t the big plan you ’ve been working on . ”
64484	64505	64481	64481	She	36	“ No . I got a bit derailed , but rest assured , my other idea is fool - proof . ”
64506	64520	64521	64521	She	36	“ I ’ll be the judge of that given your current track record . ”
64533	64536	64521	64521	She	36	“ Ouch . ”
64537	64545	64546	64546	My	0	“ Let me have a better look . ”
64589	64612	64627	64627	she	36	“ You ’re insane . There ’s no other explanation for why you would punch someone in the face without knowing how . ”
64613	64623	64624	64624	She	36	“ I thought it would be like the movies . ”
64633	64648	64627	64627	she	36	“ We need to get you to the hospital to have it checked out . ”
64672	64681	64682	64682	She	36	“ No ! I ’m fine . See ! ”
64704	64711	64712	64712	Her	36	“ Why would you punch him ? ”
64734	64738	64739	64739	She	36	“ Tell me . ”
64759	64771	64739	64739	She	36	“ Promise not to do anything illegal if I tell you ? ”
64772	64775	64776	64776	Her	36	“ No . ”
64780	64789	64776	64776	Her	36	“ You ’re not going to be happy . ”
64790	64796	64739	64739	She	36	“ I ’m never happy . ”
64835	64842	64818	64818	Her	36	“ He offered me money to … ”
64843	64847	64811	64811	She	36	“ To what ? ”
64855	64866	64867	64867	She	36	“ To prevent me from having a baby . Ever . ”
65022	65025	65012	65012	Iris	36	“ Wait ! ”
65026	65036	65037	65037	I	0	“ I ca n’t talk to you right now . ”

65113	65116	65117	65117	Her	36	“ What ? ”
65124	65133	65117	65117	Her	36	“ I ’m in a lot of pain . ”
65146	65152	65136	65136	I	0	“ Harrison will take you . ”
65153	65162	65163	65163	Her	36	“ Please do n’t make me go alone . ”
65190	65201	65203	65203	DECLAN	402	“ Fine . Let ’s get you to a doctor . ”
65401	65404	65387	65387	Iris	36	“ Here . ”

65442	65456	65433	65433	Her	36	“ Okay . Tell me your answers and I ’ll write them down . ”
65488	65508	65509	65509	Her	36	“ Do you mind reading the questions aloud for me ? I ’m too stressed to concentrate right now . ”
65515	65528	65509	65509	Her	36	“ Are you sure ? Some of the questions are probably personal . ”
65541	65547	65538	65538	she	36	“ I do n’t care . ”
65650	65662	65663	65663	Her	36	“ If it ’s any consolation , I hate hospitals too . ”
65673	65677	65678	65678	I	0	“ You do ? ”
65681	65692	65678	65678	I	0	“ Have n’t been to one since I was younger . ”
65693	65696	65697	65697	My	0	“ Why ? ”
65725	65754	65755	65755	Her	36	“ We spent a lot of time in hospitals while my mom was sick . I grew to resent everything about them , even long after she passed . ”
65810	65816	65817	65817	Her	36	“ I hate them too . ”
65821	65824	65825	65825	She	36	“ Why ? ”
65833	65837	65825	65825	She	36	“ My dad … ”
65854	65873	65874	65874	I	0	“ Let ’s just say my mom ended up in the ER a couple times for being clumsy . ”
65889	65899	65901	65901	she	36	“ And did you have issues with being clumsy ? ”
65928	65933	65921	65921	She	36	“ No . No . ”
65945	65955	65921	65921	She	36	“ If you were , you can tell me . ”
66016	66030	66008	66008	their	1090	“ It never got to that point . Nana made sure of it . ”
66031	66034	66075	66075	her	1093	“ How ? ”
66035	66070	66075	66075	her	1093	“ She caught onto the signs and interfered before things got bad . Used her savings from my grandpa ’s life insurance policy to help Mom get a divorce and start a new life . ”
66122	66137	66138	66138	She	1093	“ Did Nana ’s plan also happen to include a jug of sulfuric acid ? ”
66144	66156	66157	66157	I	0	“ I think concrete shoes were more in style back then . ”
66161	66170	66157	66157	I	0	“ Remind me to never make Nana angry . ”
66171	66183	66184	66184	She	1093	“ Forget Nana . You ’d have to deal with me . ”
66195	66201	66184	66184	She	1093	“ I ’m absolutely terrified . ”
66202	66206	66207	66208	a nurse	1094	“ Mrs. Kane ? ”
66223	66228	66212	66212	Iris	36	“ That ’s you . ”
66280	66285	66286	66287	The nurse	1094	“ I ’m here ! ”
66347	66363	66338	66338	I	0	“ I ’d like my wife to be taken care of in a private suite , ”
66379	66401	66368	66369	The nurse	1094	“ This is a hospital . Not the Ritz . Take a seat and wait for the doc like everyone else . ”
66494	66513	66514	66515	The nurse	1094	“ I ’ll pay whatever it takes to have her seen somewhere quieter . Money is no object . ”
66543	66549	66550	66550	She	36	“ You find this funny ? ”
66563	66597	66550	66550	She	36	“ Did you see her face when you said money is no object ? I think if she did n’t put the clipboard away , she would have slapped your face with it . ”
66598	66618	66550	66550	She	36	“ It ’s not my fault she is n’t accustomed to how things are done in the real world . ”
66619	66633	66634	66634	She	36	“ Wake up , dear . You ’re living in the real world . ”
66640	66645	66634	66634	She	36	“ It ’s terrifying . ”
66646	66656	66657	66657	Iris	36	“ Come here . I ’ll make it better . ”
66723	66729	66730	66730	she	36	“ Is n’t this cozy ? ”
66746	66751	66752	66752	She	36	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
66760	66781	66752	66752	She	36	“ Is now a bad time to admit I pass out whenever someone tries to stick a needle in me ? ”
66817	66824	66825	66825	She	36	“ You ’re afraid of needles ? ”
66828	66849	66825	66825	She	36	“ No . I ’m not afraid . It just happens to be a bodily reaction I ca n’t control . ”
66850	66871	66825	66825	She	36	“ That ’s good then because the nurse needs to set you up with that IV when she comes back . ”
66872	66891	66892	66892	I	0	“ No ! Do n’t tell me that ! I thought she was one of the good ones . ”
66905	66911	66912	66912	She	36	“ She lied to me ! ”
66935	66938	66939	66939	I	0	“ Careful . ”
66986	66991	66992	66992	She	36	“ I ’m joking . ”
67009	67016	67000	67000	she	36	“ Asshole ! I believed you ! ”
67029	67035	67000	67000	she	36	“ Did you just laugh ? ”
67036	67039	67000	67000	she	36	“ No . ”
67040	67043	67044	67044	Someone	1991	“ Yes . ”
67055	67081	67044	67044	Someone	1991	“ Now , do you mind shutting up ? Some of us are trying to get some sleep over here after having our stomach pumped . ”
67091	67096	67044	67044	Someone	1991	“ We ’re leaving . ”
67097	67112	67113	67114	The doctor	1106	“ Not so fast . You ca n’t leave before I check you out . ”
67236	67247	67248	67248	Her	36	“ It looks like you have a boxer ’s fracture . ”
67252	67257	67258	67258	I	0	“ That sounds badass . ”
67263	67282	67283	67284	The doctor	1106	“ Calm down , Muhammad Ali . I would n’t count today as a victory by any means . ”
67289	67304	67283	67284	The doctor	1106	“ Next time , avoid any initial contact on the fourth and fifth knuckles . ”
67305	67312	67313	67314	The doctor	1106	“ Please do n’t encourage her . ”
67375	67382	67383	67383	She	36	“ Great ! Thanks , Doc ! ”
67399	67407	67390	67390	I	0	“ I ’d like a second opinion . ”
67465	67471	67459	67460	the doctor	1106	“ For a small fracture ? ”
67472	67486	67487	67487	She	36	“ Do n’t mind him . He tends to be a bit overbearing . ”
67506	67509	67510	67511	the doctor	1106	“ Okay … ”
67588	67613	67583	67583	Iris	36	“ I ’ll be sure to wear the brace for a few weeks and avoid any kind of activities that could aggravate the injury . ”
67614	67632	67633	67634	The doctor	1106	“ Perfect . And do n’t forget to schedule a follow - up visit with your physician . ”
67647	67655	67633	67634	The doctor	1106	“ Nice meeting you , Mrs. Kane . ”
67656	67664	67665	67665	She	36	“ Will you help me with this ? ”
67700	67729	67692	67692	She	36	“ Well , at least that did n’t take as long as I thought it would . I ’m sure you ’re dying to get back to work . ”
67923	67927	67912	67912	he	209	“ unforeseen illness , ”
68091	68115	68081	68081	I	0	“ I doubt you came here to stare at your handiwork , so get on with it or get off my damn porch . ”
68116	68125	68126	68126	I	0	“ I came by to drop something off . ”
68185	68189	68173	68173	He	209	“ I see . ”
68190	68269	68173	68173	He	209	“ Take your time and have a good look . I ’m particularly fond of the reports from previous teachers going into detail about your abuse , although the hidden hospital visits for broken bones are particularly compelling . There ’s a USB attached to the back that includes some videos of our more public altercations as well , just in case you want some visual context of what ’s coming if you mess with Iris ever again . ”
68270	68295	68296	68296	I	0	“ Why are you showing me this ? Why not go out and share it with everyone so you can take over my position ? ”
68302	68336	68296	68296	I	0	“ Because I do n’t need to resort to your level to steal your position , but I ’m willing to do so if you ever pull a stunt like today ever again . ”
68337	68348	68173	68173	He	209	“ You would ruin our family ’s reputation for her ? ”
68349	68376	68377	68377	My	0	“ We are n’t family . You made sure of that the moment you told my wife to get her tubes tied , you fucking monster . ”
68405	68431	68435	68435	Declan	402	“ I ’m trying to save you the mistake of having a child with someone purely for an inheritance . You should be thanking me . ”
68441	68504	68435	68435	Declan	402	“ If I catch you talking to Iris again , whether about business or not , I ’ll release this to the public . No questions asked . No second chances . I do n’t care if you need to use a damn smoke signal to get in contact with me , so long as you leave my wife out of it . ”
68505	68518	68593	68593	I	0	“ You ’d publish this even if it makes you look weak ? ”
68519	68592	68593	68593	I	0	“ That ’s the thing , Father . I spent plenty of years thinking I was pathetic because I could n’t fight you back , but I eventually realized the only weak man here is the one staring right at me . In one way , I guess I ’m glad Mom is dead because at least she does n’t have to face the disgusting excuse of a human you ’ve become . ”
68744	68781	68735	68735	Cal	720	“ I always thought it would be Declan who showed Dad what it felt like to be on the receiving end of his parenting style , but it turns out you did the favor for him . ”
68816	68839	68811	68811	Cal	720	“ Do n’t look at me that way . I do n’t have nearly as many daddy issues as the other two . ”
68840	68853	68876	68876	he	720	“ That ’s because you have a whole host of other problems . ”
68854	68860	68811	68811	Cal	720	“ It makes me layered . ”
68861	68872	68873	68873	He	720	“ No . It means you need to seek therapy . ”
68886	68912	68876	68876	he	720	“ I ’ve been there . Done that . Turns out if you ’re not interested in changing , they ca n’t help you much . ”
68918	68922	68923	68923	He	720	“ Imagine that . ”
68926	68935	68923	68923	He	720	“ So I heard you needed my services . ”
68936	68950	68876	68876	he	720	“ Depends . How flexible are your plans over the next few weeks ? ”
68951	68959	68960	68960	I	0	“ For you ? Consider them canceled . ”
68965	68993	68960	68960	I	0	“ I seriously owe you one . I ca n’t get much done with this brace when it takes me twenty minutes to type a single paragraph . ”
68994	69005	68923	68923	He	720	“ You ’re going to regret asking for my help . ”
69006	69051	68960	68960	I	0	“ Probably , because you ca n’t focus for shit , but I ’m all out of other options . I ’m not about to spend hours next to a temp . At least this way you can make my job slightly more bearable . ”
69052	69062	68960	68960	I	0	“ You sure know how to flatter a man . ”
69063	69075	68923	68923	He	720	“ Declan does n’t seem to have a problem with it . ”
69076	69095	69098	69098	he	1136	“ Because , most days , he can barely be classified as human , let alone a man . ”
69124	69141	69114	69114	Cal	720	“ Oh God . Whatever put that look on your face needs to go . Now . ”
69179	69185	69186	69186	Declan	36	“ Why are we stopping ? ”
69202	69212	69213	69213	He	952	“ Welcome to phase one of Operation Fake Dating . ”
69223	69230	69213	69213	He	952	“ What are you talking about ? ”
69231	69253	69254	69254	His	952	“ This is my plan . Together , we ’re going to squash any doubts about our marriage , starting tonight . ”
69259	69274	69254	69254	His	952	“ With fake dating ? What does that even mean when we are married ? ”
69275	69281	69213	69213	He	952	“ It ’s simple really . ”
69282	69290	69291	69291	he	952	“ I ’m burning with anticipation here , ”
69299	69320	69294	69294	I	0	“ I planned a few public outings to make sure we are seen by anyone who is anyone in Chicago . ”
69321	69329	69330	69330	He	952	“ You lost me at public outings . ”
69373	69401	69364	69364	I	0	“ I know you want to stay hidden away in your suburban mansion , but avoiding the press is n’t going to solve any of our problems . ”
69402	69408	69364	69364	I	0	“ It ’s worked before . ”
69409	69434	69435	69435	I	0	“ I ’m sure it has , but are you willing to bet your twenty - five - billion - dollar inheritance on it ? ”
69452	69455	69447	69447	his	952	“ No . ”
69456	69470	69471	69471	He	952	“ I ’m going to need you to trust me on this one . ”
69488	69526	69480	69480	he	952	“ I booked us a reservation for two at La Luna with a table overlooking the river . It took a lot of finagling to get one at the last minute , but I know a guy . ”
69527	69537	69538	69538	I	0	“ Does his name happen to be Benjamin Franklin ? ”
69541	69551	69538	69538	I	0	“ Bribes work wonders . You taught me yourself . ”
69588	69610	69624	69624	He	952	“ Why did it require a bribe in the first place ? You could have told them it was for me . ”
69611	69623	69624	69624	He	952	“ You think that highly of yourself , do n’t you ? ”
69633	69659	69624	69624	He	952	“ For your information , name - dropping would n’t have worked here because I had a very special request that required some monetary motivation . ”
69660	69677	69678	69678	I	0	“ I ’m hesitant to ask , but I feel legally obligated to as your husband . ”
69696	69714	69715	69715	His	952	“ Our table happens to be right next to the Chicago Chronicle ’s lead gossip columnist ’s . ”
69719	69730	69731	69731	I	0	“ Now I ’m intrigued for a very different reason . ”
69734	69753	69754	69754	He	952	“ I did n’t go through all this trouble for you to blow it by doing something stupid . ”
69760	69771	69754	69754	He	952	“ How can you be sure they ’re here tonight ? ”
69772	69790	69791	69791	He	952	“ I ’d tell you , but then that would make you an accessory to the crime . ”
69812	69833	69802	69802	I	0	“ You expect me to sit next to someone who called you a brainless babymaker and do nothing about it ? ”
69834	69845	69846	69846	He	952	“ Aw . You actually sounded insulted for a second . ”
69853	69878	69846	69846	He	952	“ Listen up . The plan is simple . We go to dinner , have a drink , and pretend we ’re in love . ”
69879	69886	69887	69887	he	952	“ Because we ’re fake dating , ”
69897	69906	69887	69887	he	952	“ Right ! Now you ’re getting it . ”
69907	69913	69914	69914	I	0	“ Dating you would be … ”
69931	69944	69945	69945	His	952	“ Painful . I do n’t need you to tell me twice . ”
69964	69977	69978	69978	His	952	“ Yes . Painful is exactly how I would describe this situation . ”
70004	70043	69994	69994	I	0	“ Great . Now that we ’re on the same page about all that , are you good to go ? They ’ll give away our table if we do n’t show up in the next five minutes . ”
70044	70063	69994	69994	I	0	“ I ’m only agreeing to this scheme because you broke a few laws to make it happen . ”
70064	70086	69994	69994	I	0	“ If I ever get caught , it ’s a good thing I have you to bail me out of jail . ”
70087	70099	70100	70100	My	0	“ Who says I would n’t be in there with you ? ”
70235	70249	70226	70226	I	0	“ Anything else I can get for you , Mr. and Mrs. Kane ? ”
70289	70295	70284	70284	Declan	36	“ No , thank you . ”
70354	70362	70351	70351	he	36	“ You better be right about this . ”
70366	70374	70363	70363	I	0	“ Have a little faith in me . ”
70375	70386	70387	70387	He	36	“ I ’m a bit hesitant given your track record . ”
70399	70404	70387	70387	He	36	“ I take offense . ”
70405	70409	70410	70410	His	36	“ Forgive me . ”
70532	70542	70548	70548	I	0	“ I wish we were still on our honeymoon . ”
70554	70559	70560	70560	he	36	“ I do too , ”
70594	70597	70572	70572	he	36	“ Why ? ”
70598	70613	70572	70572	he	36	“ Because it turns out vacations are n’t the worst thing in the world . ”
70614	70618	70619	70619	His	36	“ Told you ! ”
70631	70637	70638	70638	He	36	“ What changed your mind ? ”
70642	70659	70638	70638	He	36	“ Not having to think about anything but which way I wanted to fuck you next . ”
70696	70702	70703	70703	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
70745	70750	70751	70751	he	36	“ Selling a story , ”
70754	70770	70751	70751	he	36	“ Then settle down , Romeo . This is a romance , not a porno . ”
70784	70787	70788	70788	He	36	“ Fine . ”
70812	70819	70820	70820	I	0	“ So , I was thinking … ”
70831	70840	70841	70841	I	0	“ That can never be a good thing . ”
70849	70862	70841	70841	I	0	“ Shut up . We both know you actually like my brain . ”
70863	70870	70885	70885	he	36	“ I like your heart more . ”
70906	70911	70912	70912	His	36	“ That’s … sweet . ”
70934	70947	70921	70921	I	0	“ Anyway … I thought we could do something fun this weekend . ”
70948	70952	70966	70966	His	36	“ Define fun . ”
70953	70965	70966	70966	His	36	“ I want to host a little family get - together . ”
70999	71007	71008	71008	he	36	“ What kind of get - together ? ”
71014	71020	71008	71008	he	36	“ An F1 watch party ! ”
71069	71072	71073	71073	I	0	“ No . ”
71076	71104	71105	71105	He	36	“ Why not ? Rowan will be in town for a budget meeting , so it ’s the perfect time for all of us to get together . ”
71115	71121	71110	71110	he	36	“ That ’s our thing . ”
71132	71161	71124	71124	he	36	“ If you had it your way , everything would be our thing so that you never had to share me with anyone else , you territorial caveman . ”
71162	71176	71186	71187	the reporter	1145	“ I ’m glad you finally understand . It took you long enough . ”
71192	71222	71184	71184	I	0	“ You can turn it down a notch . We ’re married now . No one is going to swoop in and take me away from you . Although … ”
71223	71227	71228	71229	The reporter	1145	“ Do n’t . ”
71238	71251	71252	71252	He	1145	“ I would leave you for one man and one man only . ”
71284	71295	71296	71296	He	1145	“ Okay , maybe two men . Absolutely three tops ! ”
71299	71313	71296	71296	He	1145	“ This list of F1 drivers seems to be growing by the week . ”
71314	71321	71268	71268	she	1145	“ It ’s all your fault . ”
71322	71345	71346	71346	My	0	“ I ’m well aware of my short - sightedness . Trust me when I say I regret it every single day . ”
71351	71361	71362	71362	I	0	“ You ’re cute when you get all possessive . ”
71376	71391	71369	71369	his	1145	“ Not sure you ’ll be feeling the same way once we get home . ”
71745	71761	71762	71762	She	1158	“ If you did n’t have to work , what would you do on weekends ? ”
71766	71775	71762	71762	She	1158	“ Like if I had a day off ? ”
71776	71782	71734	71734	she	1158	“ You have Sundays off . ”
71783	71812	71762	71762	She	1158	“ I ’m usually too dead to move by then , so I prefer vegetating in my bedroom . I ’ll only come out for water and food . ”
71813	71816	71762	71762	She	1158	“ Why ? ”
71817	71847	71762	71762	She	1158	“ Because I ’m exhausted . Working for you sucks up all my energy so by the time I get to the weekend , I ’m running on fumes . ”
71874	71889	71890	71890	She	1158	“ Fine . What would you do if you were n’t tired or working ? ”
71893	71913	71890	71890	She	1158	“ Honestly , I have no clue . The things I used to do do n’t really apply anymore . ”
71914	71917	71762	71762	She	1158	“ Like ? ”
71918	71962	71890	71890	She	1158	“ Grabbing brunch with friends . Spending the whole day movie hopping . People watching at the zoo . The options are endless really . I ’m pretty easy to entertain , so long as it is n’t anything that requires much thinking . ”
71963	71975	71976	71976	She	1158	“ When ’s the last time you did any of that ? ”
71983	71998	71976	71976	She	1158	“ Huh . Cal and I went to the movies a couple months ago . ”
71999	72002	71890	71890	She	1158	“ Together ? ”
72003	72021	72022	72022	She	1158	“ No . We went to separate theaters and called each other afterward to discuss the plots . ”
72025	72041	72022	72022	She	1158	“ Of course we went together . Who else do I have to go with ? ”
72042	72046	71976	71976	She	1158	“ A boyfriend ? ”
72047	72060	71976	71976	She	1158	“ After the last one ended in a rejected proposal , no . ”
72064	72070	71976	71976	She	1158	“ What about a friend ? ”
72071	72077	72089	72089	Her	1158	“ Cal is my friend . ”
72078	72088	72089	72089	Her	1158	“ Another friend ? Preferably of the same gender ? ”
72095	72105	72089	72089	Her	1158	“ I do n’t have any more of those . ”
72106	72110	72111	72111	She	1158	“ Why not ? ”
72118	72134	72111	72111	She	1158	“ Turns out people stop inviting you places when all you do is say no . ”
72135	72142	72208	72208	She	1158	“ Why did you say no ? ”
72143	72207	72208	72208	She	1158	“ We lived two very different lifestyles . Most of my friends had nine - to - five jobs and worked only five days a week . At first , I tried to keep up with them , but eventually I was burning myself out . I had to choose between my job and my life , and we know how that went . ”
72632	72638	72639	72639	Iris	36	“ Are you almost done ? ”
72648	72651	72652	72652	She	62	“ With ? ”
72658	72665	72652	72652	She	62	“ Your overpriced glass of whiskey . ”
72666	72672	72652	72652	She	62	“ I can afford it . ”
72673	72687	72652	72652	She	62	“ You have the same bottle at the house for half the cost . ”
72732	72739	72740	72740	She	62	“ I ’m enjoying the view . ”
72746	72758	72740	72740	She	62	“ Says the man who has n’t even looked outside once . ”
72759	72770	72771	72771	Her	62	“ That ’s not the view I ’m talking about . ”
72866	72873	72874	72874	She	62	“ What the hell was that ? ”
72883	72896	72874	72874	She	62	“ The reporter left . You do n’t need to pretend anymore . ”
72897	72903	72941	72941	she	62	“ I ’m not pretending . ”
72904	72909	72874	72874	She	62	“ That’s … concerning . ”
72910	72919	72874	72874	She	62	“ I do n’t see it as such . ”
72920	72923	72941	72941	she	62	“ No . ”
72924	72927	72932	72932	she	62	“ No ? ”
72937	72940	72941	72941	she	62	“ No , ”
72950	72961	72941	72941	she	62	“ That ’s not how this is supposed to go . ”
72962	72971	72972	72972	I	0	“ How exactly is this supposed to go ? ”
73016	73021	73000	73000	she	62	“ We work together . ”
73022	73025	73026	73026	Her	62	“ And ? ”
73037	73043	73026	73026	Her	62	“ We have a deal . ”
73044	73055	73000	73000	she	62	“ Are you stating the obvious solely to annoy me ? ”
73056	73091	73092	73092	I	0	“ Of course not . I ’m simply pointing out the stakes . There is far too much riding on our relationship for us to screw it up because we ’re horny and confused . ”
73108	73127	73103	73103	I	0	“ I ’m not confused . Far from it , actually . I know exactly what I want . ”
73128	73134	73141	73141	she	62	“ And what is that ? ”
73135	73138	73141	73141	she	62	“ You . ”
73189	73200	73174	73174	She	62	“ This has to be some kind of sick joke . ”
73216	73220	73174	73174	She	62	“ How so ? ”
73221	73234	73174	73174	She	62	“ You ca n’t want me . Not like that at least . ”
73235	73239	73174	73174	She	62	“ Why not ? ”
73240	73253	73174	73174	She	62	“ This is n’t meant to be anything but a contractual obligation . ”
73254	73263	73264	73264	I	0	“ It ’s what we say it is . ”
73284	73298	73280	73280	Her	62	“ Oh my God . Are you actually suggesting that we hook up ? ”
73311	73314	73280	73280	Her	62	“ Yes . ”
73315	73318	73326	73326	Her	62	“ Why ? ”
73319	73325	73326	73326	Her	62	“ Because I want to . ”
73337	73357	73326	73326	Her	62	“ Then I ’m sure it will be extremely difficult for you to accept that my answer is no . ”
73358	73369	73280	73280	Her	62	“ Why waste time denying what we both already know ? ”
73370	73383	73326	73326	Her	62	“ Because the last thing we need is to further complicate things . ”
73384	73400	73326	73326	Her	62	“ Hate to break it to you , but our relationship is nothing but complicated . ”
73401	73414	73415	73415	Her	62	“ No , Declan . Our relationship is nothing but a façade . ”
73481	73500	73501	73501	She	62	“ I think it ’s best if we pretend tonight never happened . For both of our sakes . ”
73525	73538	73510	73510	she	62	“ I ’ll meet you in the car . Take your time . ”
73711	73720	73701	73701	Harrison	896	“ How long have you been married for ? ”
73781	73787	73788	73788	He	896	“ Forty years and counting . ”
73799	73802	73788	73788	He	896	“ Willingly ? ”
73817	73827	73814	73814	He	896	“ She might say no if you asked her . ”
73832	73835	73836	73836	He	896	“ Why ? ”
73848	73872	73836	73836	He	896	“ Because marriage is hard , and apparently I ’m not the easiest person to get along with . Plus , I snore . ”
73881	73885	73836	73836	He	896	“ Makes sense . ”
73899	73908	73893	73893	Harrison	896	“ Mind if I offer you some advice ? ”
73917	73928	73929	73929	His	896	“ Only if you feel that it ’s absolutely crucial . ”
73945	73975	73936	73936	his	896	“ You might have gone about all the steps in the wrong order , but that does n’t mean you ca n’t restart from the beginning and try again . ”
73990	73994	73936	73936	his	896	“ You know . ”
73995	74031	73936	73936	his	896	“ Of course I know . I ’ve been driving you around since before you could reach the pedals . If you owe me anything , it ’s to not insult my intelligence like that . ”
74032	74038	74039	74039	He	896	“ You signed an NDA . ”
74046	74081	74039	74039	He	896	“ I ’m not interested in selling your story . If I was , I would have taken the money your father offered me and retired with Gerty on a sandy beach in Mexico . ”
74088	74095	74039	74039	He	896	“ He wanted to pay you ? ”
74096	74103	74039	74039	He	896	“ That ’s not the point . ”
74104	74108	74109	74109	I	0	“ How much ? ”
74124	74130	74118	74118	He	896	“ Also not the point . ”
74131	74140	74039	74039	He	896	“ Why would n’t you accept his deal ? ”
74141	74158	74039	74039	He	896	“ Because I was n’t about to give you one more reason to hate the world . ”
74159	74184	74118	74118	He	896	“ You should have taken the money because nothing you could ever do would change my opinion about humanity . I can guarantee it . ”
74185	74197	74198	74198	My	0	“ Probably not , but there is one person who might . ”
74206	74210	74211	74211	He	896	“ Not possible . ”
74218	74228	74229	74229	He	896	“ Am I missing something amusing about this conversation ? ”
74237	74264	74229	74229	He	896	“ It ’s comforting knowing that the smartest man I ’ve ever met is an idiot like the rest of us when it comes to women . ”
74270	74281	74229	74229	He	896	“ Do you even care about keeping your job anymore ? ”
74282	74303	74304	74304	I	0	“ You could try to fire me but we both know Iris would hire me back first thing tomorrow morning . ”
74315	74351	74352	74352	He	896	“ I was only trying to offer you some advice because something told me you might need it . But I see that is n’t the case , so have a good night , sir . ”
74363	74366	74352	74352	He	896	“ Harrison , ”
74395	74401	74392	74392	He	896	“ Yes , Mr. Kane ? ”
74420	74440	74441	74441	He	896	“ What would you do if you ’re attracted to a woman who wants nothing to do with you ? ”
74461	74487	74441	74441	He	896	“ Mrs. Kane can say what she wants , but she ’s interested in you . I ’ve seen it with my own two eyes . ”
74488	74495	74496	74496	He	896	“ With or without corrective lenses ? ”
74504	74511	74496	74496	He	896	“ The bifocals do n’t lie . ”
74512	74524	74441	74441	He	896	“ Regardless of what you ’ve seen , she claims otherwise . ”
74525	74542	74441	74441	He	896	“ Oh , I ’m sure she does . But that ’s where you come in . ”
74543	74549	74550	74550	His	896	“ And do what exactly ? ”
74560	74564	74550	74550	His	896	“ You chase . ”
75424	75429	75418	75418	she	1191	“ I told you ! ”
75537	75542	75534	75534	He	36	“ That never happened . ”
75543	75565	75534	75534	He	36	“ It ’s a gossip column , not the Wall Street Journal . They ’re not here to present the facts . ”
75566	75581	75534	75534	He	36	“ It ’s a wonder they ’re still up and running with that mentality . ”
75582	75604	75605	75605	His	36	“ Because articles like ours already have a million reads and counting . The advertisement money alone must keep them afloat . ”
75609	75620	75621	75621	I	0	“ A million ? It was published an hour ago . ”
75633	75641	75621	75621	I	0	“ I told you it would work . ”
75642	75651	75652	75652	He	36	“ I never doubted you to begin with . ”
75671	75678	75666	75666	I	0	“ Liar . You totally did . ”
75679	75685	75621	75621	I	0	“ It ’s human nature . ”
75686	75694	75621	75621	I	0	“ No , it ’s your nature . ”
75695	75703	75666	75666	I	0	“ It ’s gotten me this far . ”
75704	75720	75721	75721	I	0	“ No . That ’s all thanks to your last name being on the building , ”
75724	75728	75729	75729	I	0	“ Our name . ”
75734	75738	75729	75729	I	0	“ For now . ”
75739	75750	75729	75729	I	0	“ Quick to get rid of me already , wife ? ”
75848	75861	75862	75862	I	0	“ Are you trying to end up in the emergency room again ? ”
75884	75900	75881	75881	He	402	“ If you wanted my attention , this is n’t the way to get it . ”

You might not always agree on what music to play or which direction you should go . I can guarantee there will be moments you want to rip your hair out — or each other ’s . Just like there will be times that test you , where you think that maybe things would be easier if you hitch a ride with someone else . The point is , life is going to throw a lot of things at you . Stuff like flat tires , dead ends , and mechanical issues . But you can either make the most of the journey with one another or cry about never getting to your destination . No one can make the right decision but you . ”

84659	84679	84680	84680	She	62	“ Because I do n’t want to give him any reason to think we only came here for him . ”

Little things like teachers calling me lazy or classmates gossiping about how I was stupid . I was held back a year , which led to more embarrassment because all my friends moved on to the next grade without me . Eventually kids got bolder . Their words became harsher and their actions meaner . It did n’t take long for someone like me to start believing those words , especially when your own father called you a disappointing idiot every day . ”
90237	90332	90333	90333	His	1408	“ It was a self - fulfilling prophecy . With my parents ’ divorce and all the stress with that , I stopped caring about class despite my mom trying her hardest to get me into tutoring . Nothing was working , and I think she was losing hope too . My shame and anxiety kept growing until I would cry every day before school . I shut down with everyone , so my mom took a chance and found me a therapist so I could open up to someone about what was happening . ”
90341	90394	90333	90333	His	1408	“ With my therapist ’s help , I started building myself back up and found projects I was good at that had nothing to do with school . That ’s where my plant obsession started . Turns out I had a calling for bringing my mom ’s dead plants back to life . ”

90423	90450	90333	90333	His	1408	“ It helped . One plant turned into two , and eventually I started building a whole collection . My therapist called it a coping strategy . ”

90484	90514	90333	90333	His	1408	“ Once I got the emotional stuff down , I was much more open to tutoring . It took a while , but I finally started succeeding in school . ”

90521	90569	90333	90333	His	1408	“ And then I graduated high school with a lot of help . I was n’t ready to commit to a university yet after all the difficulties I went through in school , so that ’s how I ended up at the temp agency you partnered with . ”
90570	90586	90333	90333	His	1408	“ And then you drew the short stick and had to come work for me . ”
90591	90603	90333	90333	His	1408	“ You went through assistants like one would go through underwear . ”

90703	90718	90699	90699	His	1410	“ I could just tell in your eyes that you expected me to fail . ”
90719	90722	90666	90666	I	0	“ And ? ”
90723	90800	90699	90699	His	1410	“ I spent my whole life having people look at me that way . Something snapped in me when you told me to not bother unpacking my stuff since I would be gone by the end of the week . It lit a fire under my ass . I was ready to do whatever it took to prove to myself once and for all that I could achieve anything I wanted , starting with my job . ”
90801	90807	90699	90699	His	1410	“ Were n’t you afraid ? ”
90808	90852	90699	90699	His	1410	“ Of course I was . Your reputation was as terrible as your track record with assistants , but I knew nothing you could have said to me would have topped any of the shit I grew up hearing as a little kid . ”
90864	90885	90886	90886	My	0	“ If I had known sooner , I would have held back on some of the things I told you — ”
90892	90909	90910	90910	His	1411	“ Please . We both know you would have fired me if you realized my struggles . ”
90914	90920	90910	90910	His	1411	“ That ’s not true . ”
90921	90925	90948	90948	My	0	“ Why not ? ”
90926	90947	90948	90948	My	0	“ Because if my mom were alive , she would have been ashamed of me for doing something like that . ”
90962	90983	90953	90953	he	1411	“ Is that why you kept me all this time ? Despite the errors and typos and slower turnaround times ? ”
91013	91106	91007	91007	He	36	“ I kept you because you ’re fantastic at your job . You always rose to whatever challenge I threw your way , whether it was a part of your job description or not . There was n’t a single time I felt like your differences got in the way . If anything , I think it made you ten times better at your job because you thought differently than me . Just look at the Yakura deal . He would have never accepted the proposal without your additions to my model . ”
91117	91120	91007	91007	He	36	“ Oh . ”
91121	91156	91157	91157	I	0	“ I might be cold , rude , and distant , but I ’m not blind . My whole job is about evaluating assets and it turns out that you ’re my biggest one . ”
91188	91204	91173	91173	He	1991	“ There is n’t anything I would n’t do to keep you by my side . ”
91205	91222	91173	91173	He	1991	“ You do n’t need to try too hard . I am your wife after all . ”
91223	91237	91173	91173	He	1991	“ Even if you were n’t , I wo n’t give you up . ”
91266	91280	91252	91252	I	0	“ Who knew you were such a nice guy underneath your grumpy exterior ? ”
91281	91302	91305	91306	the reporter	1145	“ Do n’t go telling anyone else or they ’ll be disappointed to find out it ’s only for you . ”
91321	91324	91310	91310	Declan	36	“ Why ? ”
91325	91328	91329	91329	His	1991	“ Forelsket1 . ”
91345	91351	91336	91336	he	1991	“ Spell it for me . ”
91374	91384	91358	91358	He	1991	“ Some words are n’t meant to be translated . ”
91385	91398	91358	91358	He	1991	“ That ’s such a lie ! All your words have translations . ”
91399	91413	91414	91414	I	0	“ Correction . Some words are n’t meant to be translated by you . ”
91419	91439	91440	91440	He	1991	“ Where did you learn all these words anyway ? There ’s no way you know all these languages . ”
91449	91467	91440	91440	He	1991	“ It was a game my mom and I played together when I was a little kid . ”
91476	91479	91440	91440	He	1991	“ How ? ”
91480	91498	91511	91511	I	0	“ I was always bad at expressing my feelings , way before my mom ever got sick . ”
91499	91510	91511	91511	I	0	“ You ? No . I refuse to believe that , ”
91523	91553	91517	91517	His	1991	“ She taught me how some people need a hundred words to express a single thought , while some people only need one word to share a hundred thoughts . ”
91554	91563	91564	91564	His	1991	“ I never thought of it that way . ”
91569	91592	91593	91593	My	0	“ It became our secret code . If I was feeling a certain way , she would ask me for my word . ”
91598	91607	91608	91608	He	1991	“ What made you start using them again ? ”
91615	91642	91643	91643	His	1991	“ Not what but who . We both struggle with words in our own ways . Me with expressing them , and you with reading them . ”
91695	91705	91688	91688	I	0	“ What made you choose non - translatable ones ? ”
91706	91745	91688	91688	I	0	“ They started out in English but eventually once my brothers started picking up on it and started copying me , I switched gears . There was no way they could say kyoikumama , let alone spell it . ”
91746	91759	91688	91688	I	0	“ Always against sharing , ever since a young kid , huh ? ”
91760	91791	91688	91688	I	0	“ You ’re an only child . You ca n’t even begin to understand what it is like to grow up with siblings always stealing your stuff and copying you . ”
91792	91809	91688	91688	I	0	“ I wish ! That seems a whole lot better than spending your entire life alone . ”
91810	91818	91819	91819	I	0	“ The silence must have been nice . ”
91822	91858	91859	91859	He	0	“ It got old fast . If everything goes my way , I plan on having enough kids to fill a whole house so they never have to grow up feeling the way I did . ”
91870	91873	91859	91859	He	0	“ Kids ? ”
91874	91883	91688	91688	I	0	“ A whole minivan if I ’m lucky . ”
91884	91895	91859	91859	He	0	“ I did n’t know you wanted a big family . ”
91903	91916	91859	91859	He	0	“ You never asked , and I did n’t think it mattered . ”
91917	91921	91859	91859	He	0	“ Why not ? ”
91922	91931	91688	91688	I	0	“ Because we only agreed to one child . ”
91932	91941	91942	91942	I	0	“ What if that were n’t the case ? ”
91949	91956	91957	91957	He	0	“ What exactly are you suggesting ? ”
91970	91973	91957	91957	He	0	“ Nothing . ”
92269	92279	92260	92260	He	36	“ Is there a certain strategy to all this ? ”
92280	92292	92293	92293	I	0	“ Strategy ? It ’s a garden , not a chessboard . ”
92296	92312	92293	92293	I	0	“ Fair point . Then is there something in particular you want to see first ? ”
92313	92327	92328	92328	I	0	“ Should n’t we go wherever the person you came to see is ? ”
92339	92348	92349	92349	He	36	“ I do n’t know where they are . ”
92366	92400	92401	92401	Declan	36	“ You know , if I knew what they looked like , it would make this process a little easier . How else am I supposed to know when we need to pretend ? ”
92414	92419	92420	92420	Sparks	160	“ We do n’t . ”
92429	92444	92420	92420	Sparks	160	“ So , what ? We just act like a couple the entire time ? ”
92445	92448	92449	92449	I	0	“ Exactly . ”
92453	92469	92449	92449	I	0	“ But this place is huge . It could take hours before we find them . ”
92470	92475	92476	92476	He	36	“ Maybe even more . ”
92501	92530	92493	92493	I	0	“ They must be pretty important if you ’re going out of your way to subject yourself to walking around a garden for hours while holding my hand . ”
92531	92537	92538	92538	I	0	“ You have no idea . ”
92639	92644	92628	92628	I	0	“ Ahh ! Stop ! ”
92663	92667	92668	92668	He	1428	“ What happened ? ”
92673	92687	92688	92688	He	1428	“ You ’re walking so fast that we almost missed my favorite part . ”
92715	92723	92704	92704	I	0	“ You want to go in there ? ”
92724	92733	92688	92688	He	1428	“ Yes ! It ’s the best place ! ”
92734	92738	92739	92739	I	0	“ A greenhouse ? ”
92742	92750	92739	92739	I	0	“ Is there something wrong with that ? ”
92751	92763	92704	92704	I	0	“ I ’m just surprised you prefer that over the outdoors . ”
92764	92771	92772	92772	I	0	“ I ’ll show you why . ”
92819	92826	92816	92816	his	1428	“ Why is it so muggy ? ”
92827	92837	92816	92816	his	1428	“ Because they need to recreate the tropical climate . ”
92838	92842	92816	92816	his	1428	“ What for ? ”
92870	92896	92897	92897	He	1428	“ Plants like these would never normally survive the seasons here . Without a greenhouse , they would most likely die , especially in Chicago . ”
92911	92923	92897	92897	He	1428	“ Is that the reason you keep all your plants indoors ? ”
92924	92938	92939	92939	His	1428	“ Do I need a better reason besides to annoy you with them ? ”
92947	92969	92939	92939	His	1428	“ Living in an apartment had many perks , but a greenhouse is n’t one of them . Not enough space . ”
92984	92997	92998	92998	He	1428	“ You know how you have different words to express your feelings ? ”
93001	93008	93009	93009	I	0	“ Plants have different meanings too . ”
93023	93030	93009	93009	I	0	“ These are my absolute favorites . ”
93031	93034	93035	93035	He	1428	“ Why ? ”
93052	93069	93070	93070	I	0	“ Because it amazes me how the most beautiful flower can blossom from the worst conditions . ”
93080	93090	93070	93070	I	0	“ It seems silly to relate to a flower — ”
93091	93096	93097	93097	I	0	“ It ’s not . ”
93124	93150	93112	93112	them	1434	“ I spent a long time underestimating myself , only to realize I needed to make it past the bad stuff and find the light . ”
93151	93162	93163	93163	He	1428	“ Is this the reason you liked visiting the greenhouse ? ”
93176	93181	93163	93163	He	1428	“ The main one . ”
93182	93186	93112	93112	them	1434	“ Any others ? ”
93187	93194	93195	93195	I	0	“ You ’re looking at it . ”
93228	93236	93215	93215	His	1428	“ You ’re a crazy plant lady . ”
93237	93256	93163	93163	He	1428	“ Please . I have n’t officially earned that title until I have a greenhouse of my own . ”
93257	93263	93215	93215	His	1428	“ Do you want one ? ”
93264	93268	93215	93215	His	1428	“ A greenhouse ? ”
93269	93291	93163	93163	He	1428	“ Are the pesticides in here getting to your head or are you just struggling to comprehend what I ’m asking ? ”
93292	93307	93308	93308	His	1428	“ Maybe I ’m struggling because you ’re not asking in the first place . ”
93316	93323	93308	93308	His	1428	“ Would you like a greenhouse ? ”
93324	93329	93215	93215	His	1428	“ In your backyard ? ”
93330	93347	93348	93348	My	0	“ I think we can start calling it ours , seeing as you live there too . ”
93355	93365	93348	93348	My	0	“ You ’re offering to build me a greenhouse ? ”
93366	93392	93308	93308	His	1428	“ If only to save me from tripping over potted plants in the middle of the night when I want a goddamn glass of water . ”
93393	93413	93348	93348	My	0	“ Of course . How silly of me to think you wanted to build one to make me happy . ”
93414	93424	93426	93426	his	1428	“ Anything I do is solely for my benefit . ”
93502	93507	93499	93499	Declan	36	“ Where to next ? ”
93521	93525	93508	93508	I	0	“ That way . ”
93714	93723	93707	93707	Declan	36	“ So , did you ever find them ? ”
93724	93727	93728	93728	I	0	“ Who ? ”
93743	93755	93728	93728	I	0	“ The reporter we came here to pretend in front of . ”
93756	93759	93707	93707	Declan	36	“ No . ”
93760	93771	93707	93707	Declan	36	“ I knew it ! You can stop lying now . ”
93772	93777	93728	93728	I	0	“ Lying about what ? ”
93778	93794	93728	93728	I	0	“ We did n’t come here so a reporter could see us , did we ? ”
93799	93807	93728	93728	I	0	“ Why else would we come here ? ”
93808	93856	93728	93728	I	0	“ Because you wanted to take me out on a date , but you did n’t want to admit it was that in the first place just in case I rejected you , so you made up this whole elaborate story so I would n’t ask questions . ”
93857	93872	93875	93875	he	36	“ Is narcissism genetic or is our child safe from that awful personality trait ? ”
93877	93880	93875	93875	he	36	“ our child ”
93894	93913	93914	93914	He	36	“ Depends . If we ’re going based on paternal history , they are screwed from the start . ”
93926	93936	93914	93914	He	36	“ Hopefully they inherit their mother ’s selflessness instead . ”
94068	94075	94076	94076	His	36	“ Tell me what you want . ”
94130	94136	94137	94137	He	36	“ I ’m not sure . ”
94153	94156	94147	94147	I	0	“ Declan — ”
94177	94189	94165	94165	he	36	“ You have n’t earned the right to touch me yet . ”
94190	94195	94196	94196	He	36	“ And you have ? ”
94218	94229	94196	94196	He	36	“ I ’m not scared to claim what ’s mine . ”
94230	94236	94240	94240	I	0	“ I ’m not afraid . ”
94297	94302	94303	94303	He	36	“ Prove it then . ”
94308	94311	94303	94303	He	36	“ Strikhedonia . ”
94668	94675	94655	94655	I	0	“ How was that for proof ? ”
94725	94732	94712	94712	he	36	“ I ’m not entirely convinced . ”
94737	94744	94745	94745	I	0	“ You ’re so full of — ”
94768	94781	94782	94782	I	0	“ Are you kidding me ? We ’re back to this again ? ”
94796	94806	94790	94790	He	36	“ I want to conduct a more thorough observation . ”
94807	94812	94790	94790	He	36	“ Are you insane ? ”
94813	94826	94827	94827	I	0	“ When it comes to you , that was never a question . ”
94838	94846	94830	94830	he	36	“ You know I can walk right ? ”
94847	94859	94860	94860	I	0	“ Acutely . That does n’t mean I ’ll let you . ”
94863	94867	94860	94860	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
94868	94875	94830	94830	he	36	“ You ’re a flight risk . ”
94876	94880	94860	94860	I	0	“ Am not ! ”
94881	94904	94905	94905	My	0	“ If I had it my way , you would wear an ankle monitor so I could always know where you are . ”
94909	94915	94905	94905	My	0	“ That is absolutely terrifying . ”
94916	94933	94934	94935	Our child	2108	“ Tell me about it . I ’ve already looked into GPS chips for our child . ”
94950	94958	94959	94959	I	0	“ Thinking about becoming a father often ? ”
94966	94972	94959	94959	I	0	“ More than I should . ”
95176	95183	95152	95152	He	36	“ Let ’s play a game . ”
95184	95205	95206	95206	His	36	“ You and your damn games . I swear it ’s like you were deprived of fun as a child . ”
95234	95244	95245	95245	He	36	“ You ’ll like this one . I promise . ”
95273	95279	95266	95266	I	0	“ What are the rules ? ”
95286	95292	95280	95280	His	36	“ There is only one . ”
95293	95298	95299	95299	He	36	“ That seems easy . ”
95325	95328	95329	95329	I	0	“ Beg . ”
95335	95352	95329	95329	I	0	“ If you expect me to beg for your cock , you have another thing coming . ”
95363	95371	95329	95329	I	0	“ Who said anything about my cock ? ”
95372	95384	95385	95385	Declan	36	“ Then what exactly do you want me to beg for — ”
95429	95437	95415	95415	I	0	“ I do n’t like this game . ”
95459	95471	95448	95448	He	36	“ I ’m sure I can change your mind soon enough . ”

96251	96256	96248	96248	I	0	“ I ’m kidding ! ”
96257	96279	96248	96248	I	0	“ Just because I have n’t been with anyone in a long time does n’t mean I forgot how things work . ”
96280	96293	96294	96294	I	0	“ Why have n’t you ? Been with someone , I mean ? ”
96324	96331	96321	96321	Declan	36	“ It did n’t feel right . ”
96332	96340	96341	96341	I	0	“ Because you were obsessed with me ? ”
96359	96366	96367	96367	I	0	“ That ’s narcissistic of you . ”

96449	96457	96458	96458	He	36	“ So what ? We have sex ? ”
96471	96478	96458	96458	He	36	“ Not everything needs a plan . ”
96479	96482	96483	96483	He	36	“ But — ”

96527	96533	96534	96534	His	36	“ I can guarantee it . ”
96551	96566	96539	96539	he	36	“ Now that we settled everything , do I have permission to fuck you ? ”
96567	96577	96578	96578	He	36	“ You seem far too excited by the prospect . ”
96660	96663	96651	96651	He	36	“ What — ”
96679	96682	96683	96683	I	0	“ Off , ”
96734	96740	96741	96741	I	0	“ Like what you see ? ”
96744	96764	96765	96765	He	36	“ Depends . Is it all for show or do you have the stamina to back it all up ? ”
96778	96787	96771	96771	I	0	“ I swear you like stirring me up . ”
96788	96799	96800	96800	I	0	“ Only because I like unraveling you so much more . ”
96842	96845	96846	96846	I	0	“ Relax , ”
96977	96988	96963	96963	he	36	“ This is better than anything I could have imagined . ”

97115	97122	97095	97095	He	36	“ Did you think about this ? ”
97181	97187	97188	97188	I	0	“ Or how about this ? ”
97228	97236	97218	97218	I	0	“ More like I think of this . ”
97331	97341	97315	97315	He	36	“ Who knew you liked sucking cock that much ? ”
97348	97361	97315	97315	He	36	“ Driving you wild seems to have an addicting quality to it . ”
97499	97504	97483	97483	He	36	“ I hate you , ”
97511	97524	97505	97505	I	0	“ I look forward to fucking the lies right out of you . ”

97876	97896	97897	97897	She	1471	“ I was n’t about to kill the moment by asking if you wanted to try for a baby . ”
97900	97915	97897	97897	She	1471	“ I appreciate the thought , but I know what I signed up for . ”
97916	97938	97939	97939	My	0	“ So , what , us having sex is just a way for you to fulfill your end of a contract ? ”
97947	97953	97939	97939	My	0	“ I never said that . ”
97954	97958	97959	97959	I	0	“ Then what ? ”
97962	97990	97991	97991	Her	1471	“ I mean , I know we agreed to having a child via in vitro , but if we are attracted to each other , then maybe … ”
98147	98152	98153	98153	She	1471	“ Let me explain . ”
98165	98173	98160	98160	I	0	“ I do n’t want your explanation . ”

98228	98231	98221	98221	She	1471	“ Out . ”
98246	98251	98252	98252	Her	1471	“ It ’s late . ”
98313	98322	98323	98323	She	1471	“ Do n’t go . Not like this . ”

98351	98358	98359	98359	Her	1471	“ It does n’t feel right . ”
98364	98367	98368	98368	I	0	“ Why ? ”
98381	98387	98371	98371	She	1471	“ Because you ’re upset . ”
98388	98392	98371	98371	She	1471	“ Try again . ”
98403	98413	98371	98371	She	1471	“ Because I do n’t want you to go . ”
98414	98422	98423	98423	I	0	“ Better , but not good enough . ”
98631	98641	98623	98623	He	720	“ I was wondering when you ’d show up . ”
98642	98647	98648	98648	His	720	“ She called you . ”
98660	98671	98648	98648	His	720	“ Whatever you did , go back and fix it . ”
98672	98685	98623	98623	He	720	“ Why do you assume it ’s me that did something wrong ? ”
98686	98695	98648	98648	His	720	“ Are you seriously asking me that question ? ”
98696	98700	98701	98701	He	720	“ Fair enough . ”
98704	98721	98701	98701	He	720	“ Come on in . You look like you could use a person to talk to . ”
98753	98760	98731	98731	He	720	“ Do you want a drink ? ”
98761	98766	98767	98767	Cal	720	“ Water ’s fine . ”
98788	98795	98731	98731	He	720	“ Thought you could use both . ”
98796	98804	98731	98731	He	720	“ You do n’t even like whiskey . ”
98805	98816	98817	98817	He	720	“ No , but I like my brother . Sometimes . ”
98861	98887	98855	98855	I	0	“ While I ’m flattered you came here to seek out my advice , I ’m not sure I ’ll be able to help much . ”
98888	98891	98731	98731	He	720	“ Because ? ”
98892	98912	98855	98855	I	0	“ Iris is my best friend . I ’m not going to help you if it means hurting her . ”
98913	98936	98937	98937	I	0	“ I ’m not trying to hurt her , dumbass . I ’m trying to show her that I care about her , ”
98945	98949	98940	98940	Cal	720	“ Holy shit . ”
98962	98970	98975	98975	his	720	“ You care about her ? Really ? ”
99031	99038	99001	99001	He	720	“ Well , this changes things . ”
99039	99042	99001	99001	He	720	“ How ? ”
99043	99062	99063	99063	His	720	“ I thought you would make her fall in love with you , not the other way around . ”
99075	99083	99084	99084	He	720	“ I never said anything about love . ”
99093	99098	99084	99084	He	720	“ Are you done ? ”
99099	99132	99133	99133	Cal	720	“ I ’m sorry . It ’s just too fucking good . You married her thinking she would make your life easier , only to realize you like her . A lot . ”
99146	99161	99162	99162	I	0	“ I do n’t know why I thought coming here was a good idea . ”
99165	99168	99169	99169	He	720	“ Wait . ”
99175	99199	99169	99169	He	720	“ I ’m sorry . It was shitty for me to laugh at you when you ’re obviously going through a hard time . ”
99208	99213	99214	99214	He	720	“ I ’m leaving . ”
99219	99227	99228	99228	I	0	“ Stop . I ’ll help you . ”
99233	99244	99228	99228	I	0	“ I ’m starting to doubt you even know how . ”
99245	99273	99228	99228	I	0	“ You might not like my advice , but if you ’re willing to try it , then I think you ’ll be happy with the results . ”
99274	99279	99280	99280	I	0	“ I ’m listening . ”
99285	99305	99280	99280	I	0	“ Iris is n’t much different from any other woman . She has wants , needs , and fears . ”
99306	99316	99317	99317	He	720	“ To think I thought you would be helpful . ”
99320	99351	99317	99317	He	720	“ If you want her to fall in love with you , you have to prove to her how you ’re different from all the men she has dated before . ”
99352	99370	99280	99280	I	0	“ That ca n’t be too hard . They were all disgustingly average in every single way . ”
99371	99383	99384	99384	My	0	“ Unfortunately for you , you fall into the same category . ”
99388	99394	99384	99384	My	0	“ I highly doubt that . ”
99395	99417	99418	99418	I	0	“ You can either argue every point I make or you can shut up and listen to someone else for once . ”
99424	99448	99418	99418	I	0	“ There was always something that held her back from going all in , but the reasons all stemmed from the same issue . ”
99449	99453	99384	99384	My	0	“ Which was ? ”
99454	99462	99384	99384	My	0	“ They never fully earned her trust . ”
99463	99476	99418	99418	I	0	“ All I ’ve done is given her reasons to trust me . ”
99477	99485	99486	99486	I	0	“ Your whole relationship is a lie . ”
99489	99496	99486	99486	I	0	“ No , it ’s not . ”
99497	99508	99418	99418	I	0	“ I ’m not the one you need to convince . ”
99509	99517	99418	99418	I	0	“ What do you suggest I do ? ”
99518	99530	99486	99486	I	0	“ Easy . Start with the truth and go from there . ”
99531	99535	99418	99418	I	0	“ What truth ? ”
99536	99568	99570	99570	he	1486	“ The fact that there is probably a part of you that has been in love with her for a long time , way before you ever signed a marriage contract . ”
99717	99735	99709	99709	I	0	“ I feel like I ’m going to need something stronger for the rest of this conversation . ”
100133	100136	100125	100125	he	36	“ Declan . ”
100143	100146	100147	100147	He	36	“ Shh . ”
100160	100164	100147	100147	He	36	“ Wake up . ”
100191	100195	100180	100180	He	36	“ Good morning . ”
100215	100229	100230	100230	He	36	“ You can take your good morning and shove it up your ass . ”
100254	100265	100230	100230	He	36	“ Is there a reason I ’m in your bed ? ”
100266	100277	100278	100278	My	0	“ Because I wanted to be able to do this . ”
100362	100366	100356	100356	I	0	“ Get off . ”
100367	100372	100356	100356	I	0	“ No can do . ”
100373	100376	100356	100356	I	0	“ What ? ”
100377	100389	100390	100390	My	0	“ I ’m holding you hostage until you hear me out . ”
100444	100453	100436	100436	Declan	36	“ Stop fighting and give me ten minutes . ”
100454	100470	100479	100479	I	0	“ You do n’t deserve ten seconds , let alone ten minutes of my time . ”
100471	100478	100479	100479	I	0	“ How about ten words then ? ”
100482	100491	100479	100479	I	0	“ I ’d like to see you try . ”
100492	100505	100506	100506	I	0	“ I am falling in love with you , Iris Elizabeth Kane . ”
100566	100571	100550	100550	I	0	“ You ’re joking . ”
100572	100577	100597	100597	he	36	“ I ’m not . ”
100578	100588	100589	100589	I	0	“ This is just another part of your game . ”
100602	100615	100597	100597	he	36	“ It stopped being a game for me a long time ago . ”
100616	100621	100622	100622	His	36	“ You ’re lying . ”
100627	100643	100622	100622	His	36	“ Ask me why I hate when people use Times New Roman instead of Arial . ”
100644	100662	100597	100597	he	36	“ Are you serious right now ? What does that have to do with any of this ? ”
100663	100671	100597	100597	he	36	“ Because I chose it for you . ”
100672	100679	100622	100622	His	36	“ I ’m sorry , what ? ”
100680	100729	100622	100622	His	36	“ I read somewhere online that sans serif fonts are easier for people with dyslexia to read , so I changed my requirements . Forced everyone else I oversee to switch with me or else they would face my wrath . All because I wanted to help you . ”
100763	100773	100774	100774	I	0	“ Want to know why I kept the cactus ? ”
100777	100794	100774	100774	I	0	“ Because it was the first time someone got me a present that made me laugh . ”
100818	100829	100810	100810	His	402	“ Ask me why you were denied the job transfer . ”
100839	100846	100810	100810	His	402	“ Tell me you did n’t . ”
100856	100864	100847	100847	His	402	“ I could n’t let you go . ”
100865	100874	100875	100875	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you right now . ”
100890	100904	100875	100875	I	0	“ For what it ’s worth , I ’m not proud of it . ”
100905	100910	100911	100911	My	0	“ You sabotaged me . ”
100919	100924	100915	100915	His	402	“ I ’m sorry . ”
100925	100963	100875	100875	I	0	“ You ’re sorry ? I spent months on my presentation , perfecting it to the point of obsession , only to be rejected because you were too selfish to let me go ? Who does that ? ”
100964	100989	100875	100875	I	0	“ Someone who does n’t understand the first thing about loving someone , but is willing to try if you give me a chance . ”
100990	101009	101010	101010	He	402	“ You want me to give you a chance after everything ? Do you think I ’m stupid ? ”
101025	101034	101010	101010	He	402	“ Intelligence has nothing to do with this . ”
101035	101053	100875	100875	I	0	“ Easy for you to say when you ’re not the one who feels like a fool . ”
101054	101082	101083	101083	He	402	“ Really ? Because based on your reaction today , I ’m feeling pretty damn foolish for ever admitting that I ’m falling in love with you . ”
101097	101100	101106	101106	he	402	“ Declan … ”
101122	101195	101112	101112	My	0	“ I ’m not asking you to love me back . I do n’t expect that and I ’m not sure if I ever will because I ’m the furthest thing from lovable . I ’m selfish , rude , and do n’t know the first thing about being in a relationship with someone . But that does n’t mean I ’m not willing to try for you if you let me . ”
101260	101281	101282	101283	The man	2021	“ Just because you make selfish choices does n’t mean you ’re a selfish person . At least not completely . ”
101314	101324	101307	101307	I	0	“ Your logic is half - baked at best . ”
101325	101337	101338	101338	His	402	“ So is yours , seeing as you called yourself unlovable . ”
101342	101348	101338	101338	His	402	“ I ’m stating facts . ”
101349	101375	101307	101307	I	0	“ I do n’t know what bullshit your father told you over the years , but it ’s not true . Your brothers love you . ”
101376	101382	101338	101338	His	402	“ They ’re obligated to . ”
101383	101397	101398	101398	He	402	“ No one is obligated to love someone else . Blood or not . ”
101404	101409	101398	101398	He	402	“ You ’re right . ”
101416	101426	101427	101427	He	402	“ I could get used to hearing those words . ”
101435	101450	101427	101427	He	402	“ Give me a chance and I ’ll tell you them every single day . ”
101457	101463	101451	101451	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
101464	101472	101427	101427	He	402	“ Tell me what ’s stopping you . ”
101473	101480	101490	101490	I	0	“ You do n’t do relationships . ”
101481	101489	101490	101490	I	0	“ Good thing I ’m married then . ”
101495	101503	101490	101490	I	0	“ Our marriage is n’t even real . ”
101504	101527	101528	101528	I	0	“ A scrap of paper does n’t define what we are . Feelings do , and mine are a hundred percent genuine . ”
101534	101545	101528	101528	I	0	“ What if my feelings are telling me to run ? ”
101546	101571	101572	101572	I	0	“ It ’s cute you think you can outrun me , but I ’ll give you a head start just to make things interesting . ”
101575	101585	101572	101572	I	0	“ Do you always have an answer for everything ? ”
101586	101595	101598	101598	he	402	“ Not for the one that matters most . ”
101723	101737	101738	101738	He	402	“ This could be a disaster , but I ’m willing to try . ”
101961	101970	101971	101971	Cal	720	“ Look who finally decided to join us ! ”
101983	101989	101971	101971	Cal	720	“ What is going on ? ”
102039	102052	102024	102024	he	402	“ Your husband here invited us over to watch an F1 race . ”
102053	102056	102015	102015	he	402	“ Us ? ”
102057	102068	102069	102069	Cal	720	“ Rowan and Zahra are late , as per usual . ”
102082	102088	102069	102069	Cal	720	“ They ’re coming here ? ”
102089	102092	102093	102093	Cal	720	“ Surprise ? ”
102102	102108	102109	102109	He	720	“ The batteries are dead . ”
102132	102140	102122	102122	I	0	“ He really did n’t tell you ? ”
102141	102151	102153	102153	he	36	“ No . It must have slipped his mind . ”
102229	102248	102216	102216	Cal	720	“ Do you have some exciting news to share with me or is this an insult to injury ? ”
102252	102258	102259	102259	Declan	402	“ I ’m not pregnant . ”
102266	102272	102259	102259	Declan	402	“ Not yet at least . ”
102313	102349	102350	102350	Declan	402	“ Well , that ’s my cue to go find something stronger to drink . There ’s no way I ’ll get through being the fifth wheel without wanting to chop my own dick off . ”
102363	102366	102357	102357	he	36	“ So … ”
102387	102398	102370	102370	He	36	“ What ’s the real reason you planned this all ? ”
102409	102412	102370	102370	He	36	“ Gezelligheid1 . ”
102429	102453	102454	102454	He	36	“ G - E - Z - E - L - L - I - G - H - E - I - D. ”
102464	102472	102454	102454	He	36	“ Where did you learn this one ? ”
102473	102483	102484	102484	I	0	“ During my month studying abroad in the Netherlands . ”
102491	102501	102502	102502	He	36	“ Cozy ? That ’s why you did this ? ”
102507	102528	102502	102502	He	36	“ It ’s more than that . It ’s about creating a place where people can relax and feel happy . ”
102529	102540	102454	102454	He	36	“ Since when do you care about making people happy ? ”
102541	102556	102557	102557	My	0	“ I could n’t care less about anyone else ’s happiness besides your own . ”
102564	102587	102557	102557	My	0	“ That has to be one of the sweetest — but extremely fucked up — things anyone has ever said to me . ”
102588	102593	102594	102594	He	36	“ Fucked up how ? ”
102602	102624	102594	102594	He	36	“ Because you should do nice things because you want to , not because you think it would make me happy . ”
102625	102641	102644	102644	I	0	“ I want to make you happy , so therefore , I do nice things . ”
102679	102693	102694	102694	His	36	“ What happens when what makes me happy goes against what you want ? ”
102698	102706	102694	102694	His	36	“ Then I ’ll convince you otherwise . ”
102711	102719	102694	102694	His	36	“ That ’s not how relationships work . ”
102720	102739	102672	102672	I	0	“ We are n’t a typical relationship , so therefore , the same rules do n’t apply here . ”
102740	102759	102694	102694	His	36	“ There might be a time in your life when you ca n’t convince me . What then ? ”
102760	102777	102694	102694	His	36	“ When it comes to you , I ’m not opposed to using any means necessary . ”
102778	102782	102783	102783	He	36	“ Including torture ? ”
102793	102805	102783	102783	He	36	“ Is it still considered torture if I let you come ? ”
102806	102816	102817	102817	He	36	“ I ’ve unlocked a sexed - up monster . ”
102921	102924	102925	102925	She	2711	“ Hey ! ”
102948	102959	102936	102936	she	2711	“ I ’m so excited to hang out with you ! ”
102960	102964	102965	102965	I	0	“ Me too , ”
102979	102982	102983	102983	Rowan	715	“ Declan . ”
102988	102994	102995	102995	He	402	“ Thanks for coming over . ”
103026	103033	103010	103010	he	402	“ Your threats made me curious . ”
103034	103037	103038	103038	I	0	“ Threats ? ”
103073	103083	103058	103058	Rowan	715	“ I ’m going to thoroughly enjoy this all . ”
103084	103093	103094	103094	He	402	“ Are you a big fan of F1 ? ”
103105	103117	103094	103094	He	402	“ The biggest . I love watching people crash and burn . ”
103118	103123	103124	103124	Zahra	2711	“ That ’s horrifying . ”
103135	103156	103130	103130	Declan	402	“ Well , as fun as this whole pissing contest is , some of us came here for the mimosas . ”
103172	103177	103178	103178	I	0	“ Lead the way . ”
103234	103269	103229	103229	Zahra	2711	“ Do n’t mind them . Rowan has been out for Declan ’s blood ever since the whole Dreamland debacle happened . It was only a matter of time before they hashed everything out . ”
103305	103311	103312	103312	She	715	“ You know about that ? ”
103315	103330	103312	103312	She	715	“ Oh yeah . Rowan told me after he decided to stay at Dreamland . ”
103331	103334	103303	103303	Zahra	2711	“ Wow . ”
103335	103394	103312	103312	She	715	“ As much as I love that he did that , I ’m not one for family drama , so I ’d rather they fix things sooner rather than later . For Rowan ’s sake at least . He pretends he does n’t care about Declan being angry , but I know him . He loves his brother . ”
103395	103408	103312	103312	She	715	“ If it means anything , I think Declan misses him too . ”
103409	103420	103421	103421	Cal	720	“ More like he misses picking on his baby brother . ”
103429	103455	103456	103456	I	0	“ Declan found someone else to torture now , so I think we ’re safe from his wrath , so long as Iris puts out . ”
103462	103469	103456	103456	I	0	“ Who said anything about that ? ”
103470	103477	103478	103478	Zahra	2711	“ I caught you kissing earlier . ”
103483	103488	103478	103478	Zahra	2711	“ You kissed him . ”
103497	103509	103510	103510	She	2711	“ Oh my God . We need to talk . Now . ”
103585	103599	103600	103600	she	2711	“ Nice room . It ’s a lot different than what I expected , ”
103607	103621	103622	103622	She	2711	“ The dungeon is being cleaned so this was the next best thing . ”
103625	103640	103641	103641	I	0	“ Sorry . I tend to talk out loud sometimes and forget my manners . ”
103649	103663	103664	103664	Her	2711	“ Do n’t worry . I ’m sure you ’re curious about everything . ”
103670	103697	103664	103664	Her	2711	“ Yes ! I ’ve been dying to ask you about your fake marriage , but your wedding did n’t seem like the most appropriate place . ”
103698	103716	103717	103717	She	2711	“ For legal purposes , I have to tell you not to repeat this conversation to anyone . ”
103720	103732	103733	103733	I	0	“ Does that spiel actually work on any of your friends ? ”
103736	103756	103757	103757	Her	2711	“ I would n’t know . Besides Cal , who already knows everything , I do n’t have any . ”
103763	103768	103769	103769	I	0	“ That ’s sad . ”
103772	103778	103769	103769	I	0	“ It ’s old news . ”
103779	103783	103805	103805	She	2711	“ Is it ? ”
103784	103797	103798	103798	My	0	“ I thought we came up here to talk about my marriage . ”
103816	103823	103805	103805	She	2711	“ Touchy subject . Got it . ”
103832	103844	103824	103824	I	0	“ Sorry . I do n’t mean to come off rude . ”
103845	103860	103805	103805	She	2711	“ Do n’t worry about it . I ’m not here to judge you . ”
103861	103868	103824	103824	I	0	“ Not even a little bit ? ”
103869	103873	103874	103874	I	0	“ What for ? ”
103880	103892	103893	103893	Her	2711	“ You do n’t find my situation a little … weird ? ”
103900	103927	103893	103893	Her	2711	“ Not at all . If anything , it ’s kind of romantic , seeing as he invited us over here to spend time with you . ”
103928	103935	103824	103824	I	0	“ That in itself is confusing . ”
103936	103940	103893	103893	Her	2711	“ How so ? ”
103941	103958	103959	103959	Her	2711	“ I asked him a while back and he told me he did n’t want to . ”
103964	103968	103959	103959	Her	2711	“ I see . ”
103969	103977	104021	104021	I	0	“ Feel free to share your thoughts . ”
103978	104020	104021	104021	I	0	“ There is n’t much to it . You wanted something and he made it happen . At least he ’s a quick learner . It took Rowan months to realize he actually cared about my feelings more than his own . ”
104024	104035	104036	104036	Her	2711	“ Whoa . I did n’t say anything about feelings . ”
104040	104056	104036	104036	Her	2711	“ Come on . You must know he has some kind of feelings for you . ”
104057	104066	104036	104036	Her	2711	“ He told me himself that he does . ”
104067	104074	104036	104036	Her	2711	“ Then what ’s the problem ? ”
104075	104078	104036	104036	Her	2711	“ Me . ”
104115	104124	104110	104110	I	0	“ Oh . It all makes sense now . ”
104125	104129	104110	104110	I	0	“ What does ? ”
104130	104160	104110	104110	I	0	“ It ’s normal to be afraid of something new . I was like you — scared and unsure about dating a man again after I was burned badly . ”
104161	104165	104166	104166	I	0	“ You were ? ”
104181	104217	104166	104166	I	0	“ Oh yeah . I went through a rough breakup with someone I thought I was going to marry one day . Turns out he was cheating on me with one of the Dreamland princesses . ”
104218	104221	104222	104222	I	0	“ Ouch . ”
104229	104258	104225	104225	Her	2711	“ At the time , it felt like my world was ending . But now I realize it was the best thing that could have happened to me . ”
104259	104265	104266	104266	She	2711	“ Because you found Rowan ? ”
104271	104277	104266	104266	She	2711	“ Because I found myself . ”
104278	104299	104300	104300	She	2711	“ I feel like I ’m going to need a lot more than a mimosa for this kind of conversation . ”
104303	104311	104312	104312	I	0	“ Too deep for a Sunday morning ? ”
104315	104320	104321	104321	We	1534	“ Way too deep . ”
104424	104445	104413	104413	he	720	“ I hate to interrupt this bonding session but the race is about to start and Declan ’s getting antsy . ”
104446	104462	104413	104413	he	720	“ He ’s just annoyed he has to talk to you for twenty minutes straight . ”
104463	104488	104489	104489	I	0	“ Watching him fumble through small talk that has nothing to do with work or our inheritances is far more entertaining than I thought . ”
104495	104506	104507	104507	Cal	720	“ Let ’s go put Declan out of his misery . ”
104510	104536	104537	104537	Zahra	2711	“ I know you ’re biased because you ’re his wife , but the man has been miserable ever since the day he was born . ”
104540	104551	104537	104537	Zahra	2711	“ I have a feeling that ’s about to change . ”
104588	104591	104592	104592	She	2711	“ Iris ! ”
104605	104608	104609	104609	I	0	“ What ? ”
104634	104643	104644	104644	I	0	“ Did you see Yakura ’s latest email ? ”
104662	104668	104669	104669	My	0	“ No . What happened ? ”
104679	104688	104669	104669	My	0	“ He received a call from my father . ”
104689	104692	104693	104693	Cal	720	“ Fuck . ”
104702	104713	104714	104714	She	2711	“ Yakura ’s threatening to pull out of the project . ”
104723	104726	104714	104714	She	2711	“ Why ? ”
104727	104758	104714	104714	She	2711	“ He did n’t go into any specific details , but his sentence about how our goals do n’t seem to align was as good of a hint as any . ”
104893	104906	104907	104907	Iris	36	“ We can fix this . I ’ll reach out to Yakura . ”
104935	104955	104917	104917	She	36	“ And say what ? ‘ Sorry my dad ’s a dick . He did n’t mean it , ’ ”
104964	104979	104959	104959	Her	36	“ Of course not . What do you take me for ? An amateur ? ”
104980	104991	104992	104992	Iris	36	“ Then how do you plan on winning him over ? ”
104997	105006	104992	104992	Iris	36	“ We show him how our goals align . ”
105007	105016	105017	105017	Cal	720	“ Do we even know what those are ? ”
105063	105080	105081	105081	Iris	36	“ I have an idea but I do n’t know if it ’s a good one … ”
105087	105094	105095	105095	Cal	720	“ This does n’t sound promising . ”
105112	105116	105117	105117	She	36	“ Go ahead . ”
105125	105170	105117	105117	She	36	“ When we initially introduced the idea of building Dreamland Tokyo , Yakura ’s first question had nothing to do with profits . I found it strange that someone as successful as him would n’t care about how much money he stands to make . ”
105171	105178	105179	105179	Cal	720	“ What did he ask about ? ”
105184	105204	105179	105179	Cal	720	“ If we could make Dreamland Tokyo happen before he was too old to enjoy it with his grandkids . ”
105205	105212	105213	105213	I	0	“ I do n’t remember that , ”
105230	105251	105226	105226	Her	36	“ Of course you do n’t . You were too focused on pulling up the next slide discussing expected proceeds . ”
105252	105260	105261	105261	Cal	720	“ So he cares about his family , ”
105267	105284	105264	105264	She	36	“ We ’re screwed . There ’s no way Declan can work with someone like that . ”
105285	105303	105226	105226	Her	36	“ I disagree . Because while your father might be clever , he missed one tiny detail . ”
105304	105307	105264	105264	She	36	“ What ? ”
105308	105311	105312	105312	Her	36	“ Me . ”
105382	105390	105379	105379	Cal	720	“ Someone thinks mighty highly of herself . ”
105417	105440	105404	105404	I	0	“ I know my strong suits , and picking up after Declan ’s messes happens to be a personal strength of mine . ”
105441	105449	105450	105451	my brother	1990	“ So what ’s your plan then ? ”
105454	105467	105468	105468	Her	36	“ Easy . We show him exactly what Dreamland has to offer . ”
105474	105481	105468	105468	Her	36	“ How do we do that ? ”
105493	105520	105482	105482	I	0	“ We take him to where it all started and show him what he would be missing out on if he walks away from this deal . ”
105521	105533	105534	105534	Cal	720	“ Are you suggesting we take a family trip to Dreamland ? ”
105608	105618	105619	105619	My	0	“ How is this supposed to change his mind ? ”
105627	105649	105650	105650	Cal	720	“ Yakura is a family man . We need to show him how , unlike your father , so are you . ”
105658	105664	105650	105650	Cal	720	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
105670	105695	105650	105650	Cal	720	“ The idea of you playing a family man is too good to pass up . You can count on me to be there . ”
105696	105703	105704	105704	She	1554	“ Who said you were invited ? ”
105731	105740	105723	105723	He	720	“ I ’m part of the promotional package . ”
105741	105745	105746	105746	I	0	“ Not happening , ”
105762	105768	105751	105751	He	720	“ He ’s the boss . ”
105789	105801	105802	105802	He	720	“ I do n’t like you two ganging up on me . ”
105814	105828	105829	105829	He	720	“ It ’s in your best interest . You hate business talk anyway . ”
105832	105848	105829	105829	He	720	“ You ’re right . Still fucked up though when you ’re my best friend . ”
105849	105865	105872	105872	she	1554	“ And he ’s my husband . Do n’t make me choose between you two . ”
105901	105909	105910	105910	Cal	720	“ You two in love is disgusting . ”
105918	105926	105915	105915	She	1554	“ No one said anything about love . ”
105991	106003	106004	106004	I	0	“ There ’s a chance he might not even say yes , ”
106025	106036	106037	106037	Iris	36	“ After all this time , you still doubt me ? ”
106046	106057	106058	106058	I	0	“ It ’s not you that I ’m worried about , ”
106074	106080	106084	106084	Iris	36	“ Leave it to me . ”
106094	106097	106084	106084	Iris	36	“ Here . ”
106098	106103	106084	106084	Iris	36	“ What ’s that ? ”
106104	106135	106084	106084	Iris	36	“ Next week ’s travel itinerary . I already went ahead and cleared your calendar , that way we have enough time to get acclimated to Dreamland before Yakura visits . ”
106264	106277	106260	106260	Iris	36	“ Please tell me you went about this plan the legal way . ”
106278	106307	106308	106308	I	0	“ That depends on if you consider it illegal to hijack Yakura ’s travel plans to the Grand Canyon and pay someone to ground his plane in Florida . ”
106316	106321	106322	106322	She	36	“ You did n’t . ”
106335	106356	106322	106322	She	36	“ Of course I did n’t ! Although I ’m flattered you think I could pull off such a stunt . ”

112360	112382	112383	112383	She	36	“ It ’s like the Chicago Botanic Garden on steroids . They have fifteen greenhouses . I already got lost twice ! ”
112467	112479	112459	112459	she	36	“ Sounds like we need to invest in that ankle monitor . ”
112480	112488	112492	112492	her	36	“ I wish you could be here . ”
112502	112507	112492	112492	her	36	“ I do too . ”
112575	112591	112568	112568	Zahra	2711	“ Zahra is asking if we are still on later for dinner with your brother ? ”
112592	112604	112568	112568	Zahra	2711	“ Only because you manipulated me with sex to get it . ”
112605	112613	112568	112568	Zahra	2711	“ You were n’t complaining last night . ”
112614	112623	112624	112624	She	36	“ I ’m saving it all for later . ”
112627	112635	112624	112624	She	36	“ Be good to your brother today . ”
112636	112643	112568	112568	Zahra	2711	“ I ’m making no promises . ”
112644	112647	112624	112624	She	36	“ Declan … ”
112648	112659	112624	112624	She	36	“ Fine . But only because you told me to . ”
112674	112682	112624	112624	She	36	“ Shit . I got ta go . ”
112683	112702	112703	112703	Her	36	“ Me too . We ’re visiting the Flower Festival floats next . I ’ll send you pictures ! ”
112760	112764	112756	112756	I	0	“ Have fun , ”
112910	112914	112896	112896	Rowan	715	“ Mr. Yakura . ”

112970	112975	112976	112976	He	1628	“ What a surprise . ”
112979	112997	112976	112976	He	1628	“ I was just telling your father here how I was too excited to wait any longer . ”
112998	113004	113005	113005	He	1628	“ Where is your wife ? ”
113010	113066	113005	113005	He	1628	“ I did n’t want to bore her with the little details , so she and I will be exploring the park together tomorrow . She ’s the whole reason I agreed to this meeting in the first place . It ’s not like she would ever let me turn down a trip to Dreamland . ”
113086	113094	113095	113096	my father	258	“ We can get you VIP passes , ”
113175	113185	113169	113169	I	0	“ So , are we ready to get going ? ”
113195	113199	113200	113200	Rowan	715	“ After you . ”
113296	113317	113318	113318	Rowan	715	“ I ’d love to show you a hidden part of the castle if you are up for some steps . ”
113330	113345	113318	113318	Rowan	715	“ I ’m sure it can wait until after we circle around the park . ”
113352	113367	113318	113318	Rowan	715	“ Might as well knock it out of the way while we are here . ”
113475	113481	113482	113482	I	0	“ What is he doing ? ”
113498	113505	113482	113482	I	0	“ Showing him the hidden tower . ”
113506	113511	113512	113512	Rowan	715	“ What hidden tower ? ”
113521	113549	113512	113512	Rowan	715	“ The one Grandpa had built for Grandma before she passed . Since she never got to see it , he never showed it to anyone else . ”
113615	113634	113611	113611	You	1641	“ And you never thought to mention this story during the countless conversations we had about this place ? ”
113635	113643	113659	113659	I	0	“ I did n’t think it mattered . ”
113644	113658	113659	113659	I	0	“ Obviously you were wrong , which seems to be a trend lately , ”
113711	113723	113708	113708	Rowan	715	“ Do n’t lash out at me because you ’re pissed . ”
113724	113767	113708	113708	Rowan	715	“ Pissed does n’t begin to cover how I feel right now . You had one job to do . To think you gave up everything for this position and you ca n’t even do it right . What a fucking disgrace . ”
113820	113828	113829	113830	My brother	1990	“ Fuck you and fuck your walkthrough . ”
113846	113857	113858	113858	I	0	“ Find your own way around the park , asshole . ”
114083	114097	114075	114075	Yakura	35	“ You thought you could plan this impromptu trip without me finding out ? ”
114098	114105	114066	114066	he	258	“ It ’s not your deal . ”
114106	114119	114120	114120	I	0	“ I ’m the CEO . Everything about the company is mine . ”
114133	114145	114120	114120	I	0	“ Except this one wo n’t start until I ’m CEO . ”
114146	114154	114155	114155	His	258	“ Not if I can help it . ”
114173	114182	114167	114167	He	258	“ You did n’t even want this deal . ”
114183	114227	114228	114228	I	0	“ I did n’t until you thought you could blackmail me and get away with it . I ’ll thoroughly enjoy ripping this project away from your fingertips , only to show you what a pathetic excuse for a CEO you would make . ”
114351	114358	114362	114362	him	1658	“ Calling your wife for help ? ”
114379	114399	114374	114374	He	1658	“ You ’re a pathetic excuse of a man if you need your wife to help save the day . ”
114464	114478	114457	114457	She	36	“ Hey . I was just thinking of you while checking out a — ”
114479	114484	114457	114457	She	36	“ I need you . ”
114485	114490	114491	114491	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
114502	114513	114491	114491	I	0	“ Yakura and my father stopped by ahead of schedule . ”
114514	114517	114539	114539	she	36	“ Oh . ”
114549	114560	114539	114539	she	36	“ Send me your location and I ’ll find you . ”
114770	114789	114765	114765	Zahra	2711	“ Check this out . They ’ve been waiting six years for this one to bloom . Six ! ”
114800	114826	114790	114790	I	0	“ I ’m going to need to take a rain check on today ’s plans . I ’m so sorry , but something came up . ”
114832	114841	114842	114842	I	0	“ Oh no , are you feeling okay ? ”
114847	114861	114842	114842	I	0	“ I feel … Frankly , I do n’t know how I feel . ”
114881	114886	114871	114871	I	0	“ Can I help ? ”
114887	114915	114827	114827	Zahra	2711	“ You can by telling me how I can get back to Dreamland . Seth showed up and I need to go help Declan before something happens . ”
114916	114921	114922	114922	Her	2711	“ Seth is here ? ”
114926	114931	114922	114922	Her	2711	“ And Mr. Yakura . ”
114932	114935	114871	114871	I	0	“ Together ? ”
114936	114955	114922	114922	Her	2711	“ I have no idea how that happened , but I do n’t doubt Seth was behind it . ”
114956	114971	114972	114972	She	2711	“ Well , we ca n’t just let him take over , can we ? ”
115020	115026	115004	115004	she	2711	“ You ’re driving me ? ”
115027	115057	115004	115004	she	2711	“ You need to get to the park somehow , do n’t you ? I hope you did n’t think I ’d let you walk all the way there . ”
115058	115062	115063	115063	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
115078	115086	115070	115070	Zahra	2711	“ That ’s what friends are for . ”
115087	115097	115098	115098	She	2711	“ Are n’t you upset I have to cancel ? ”
115101	115109	115098	115098	She	2711	“ We can come back another time . ”
115110	115117	115070	115070	Zahra	2711	“ I ’m so sorry again . ”
115118	115141	115142	115142	I	0	“ No need to apologize . I get it . Things pop up for Rowan all the time at the last minute . ”
115145	115152	115153	115153	She	2711	“ Does it ever upset you ? ”
115156	115175	115176	115176	I	0	“ Oh yeah . Sometimes I want to take his phone and drop it in the nearest toilet . ”
115179	115185	115176	115176	I	0	“ But you do n’t . ”
115186	115208	115153	115153	She	2711	“ Only because of sheer will and a parting orgasm from Rowan before he goes to fix whatever crisis popped up . ”
115209	115221	115176	115176	I	0	“ I guess that ’s one way to pacify a partner . ”
115222	115247	115248	115248	I	0	“ You have no idea . If you asked Declan , I ’m sure he would be happy to oblige with the same policy . ”
115251	115255	115256	115256	She	2711	“ I guess . ”
115263	115280	115256	115256	She	2711	“ What ’s really wrong ? Something tells me it has nothing to do with orgasms . ”
115281	115287	115288	115288	My	0	“ It ’s just that … ”
115367	115446	115353	115353	I	0	“ I struggle with not feeling upset at him for things like this . Being his assistant is great , do n’t get me wrong , but it ’s exhausting . I ’m worried things will only get worse once he ’s CEO . I ca n’t help wondering how it could tear us apart as a couple , adding resentment that should n’t even be there if I was n’t his employee as well as his wife . ”
115447	115455	115491	115491	She	1674	“ And if you have a baby … ”
115456	115490	115491	115491	She	1674	“ There ’s no way I could be pregnant and keep up with his crazy schedule . I ’d spend more time asleep on my desk than I would spend working at it . ”
115494	115505	115491	115491	She	1674	“ Do you plan on finding a replacement sometime soon ? ”
115506	115524	115353	115353	I	0	“ I ’m not sure … I have n’t considered it since I thought about transferring jobs . ”
115525	115561	115353	115353	I	0	“ It could be nice to give it another thought , especially if you ’re more serious as a couple now . Sometimes what feels wrong in one moment can feel perfectly right later on . ”
115562	115572	115491	115491	She	1674	“ He wo n’t want to let me go . ”
115573	115598	115599	115599	My	0	“ He might not , but it ’s to be expected . I hear you ’re amazing at your job and really kick ass . ”
115603	115620	115599	115599	My	0	“ Thanks , but it feels like my ass is the one being kicked right now . ”
115621	115641	115642	115642	Zahra	2711	“ Sometimes life is like that . Not every plan can work out the way you want it to . ”
115656	115677	115642	115642	Zahra	2711	“ This is the closest I can get you to his location without actually driving where guests can see me . ”
115678	115684	115695	115695	She	2711	“ Thank you so much . ”
115685	115694	115695	115695	She	2711	“ Thank me by kicking Seth ’s ass . ”
115703	115717	115718	115718	She	2711	“ Go ! Take the back alleys so you can avoid the crowds . ”
115801	115804	115793	115794	Mr. Yakura	35	“ Iris ! ”
115868	115874	115875	115875	Declan	402	“ Where ’s your inhaler ? ”
115889	115895	115896	115896	His	402	“ Your inhaler , Iris . ”
115941	115944	115945	115945	He	402	“ Here . ”
116070	116078	116079	116079	Yakura	35	“ I was wondering where you were . ”
116110	116116	116117	116117	He	2021	“ Where ’s your wife ? ”
116124	116147	116117	116117	He	2021	“ She stayed at the hotel . Had I realized you would be joining us , I would have brought her along . ”
116148	116156	116157	116157	His	2021	“ What if we go get her ? ”
116163	116181	116157	116157	His	2021	“ Are you sure ? I would n’t want to put anyone out by changing our plans . ”
116182	116202	116203	116203	He	2021	“ Nonsense . We ca n’t spend the day at Dreamland without her . It would n’t be right . ”
116206	116214	116203	116203	He	2021	“ This is why I like you . ”
116453	116459	116441	116441	They	1686	“ Doing okay , son ? ”
116508	116513	116514	116514	He	2365	“ I ’m fine . ”
116520	116560	116514	116514	He	2365	“ You can give up at any time and I ’ll take over to secure the deal . I ’m even willing to give you credit and put in a good word for you during our next board meeting . ”
116561	116565	116514	116514	He	2365	“ Shut up . ”
116566	116607	116608	116608	My	0	“ I ’m trying to help you . While I ’d be happy to finish this off and secure us a new park , all it would take is one misstep from me and the deal is good as dead . ”
116613	116621	116608	116608	My	0	“ You should n’t even be here . ”
116622	116648	116514	116514	He	2365	“ You should have mentioned that to your wife then before she set up an automatic email letting everyone know where you were this week . ”
116649	116654	116655	116655	He	0	“ You ’re lying . ”
116658	116670	116655	116655	He	0	“ Go ahead and check your phone . I ’ll wait . ”
116689	116696	116679	116679	His	0	“ I do n’t believe you . ”
116724	116745	116699	116699	she	1687	“ I take it you do n’t want to accept my offer to help finish this once and for all ? ”
116746	116752	116699	116699	she	1687	“ Over my dead body . ”
116753	116773	116699	116699	she	1687	“ No parent wants to bury their child , but I suppose I ’m willing to make an exception . ”
116774	116784	116785	116785	I	0	“ I do n’t have time for this shit . ”
116797	116819	116820	116820	Iris	36	“ I was telling them all about the greenhouses we have on the company property a few miles away from here . ”
116826	116839	116840	116840	I	0	“ Great . I doubt they ’re interested in going there though , ”
116853	116868	116846	116846	Her	36	“ So , I was wondering what you both would like to see next ? ”
116869	116873	116874	116875	Mrs. Yakura	172	“ Roller coasters , ”
116886	116893	116874	116875	Mrs. Yakura	172	“ Nothing that causes back pain . ”
117183	117191	117177	117177	she	36	“ I need to use the restroom . ”
117238	117245	117222	117222	She	36	“ This is n’t going well . ”
117246	117254	117255	117255	I	0	“ Really ? What gave it away ? ”
117262	117285	117255	117255	I	0	“ This does n’t feel right . I think we need to step back and regroup before it explodes in our faces . ”
117286	117304	117305	117305	My	0	“ I ’m not about to run away from something difficult because it does n’t feel right . ”
117320	117328	117315	117315	Her	36	“ Your father is up to something . ”
117329	117369	117255	117255	I	0	“ I appreciate your concern , but I did n’t ask you to come here so you could waste your time analyzing my father , seeing as he would n’t even be here if it were n’t for you . ”
117370	117373	117374	117374	She	36	“ What ? ”
117378	117393	117374	117374	She	36	“ He told me about the automatic email replies you set up for me . ”
117394	117408	117409	117409	I	0	“ So what ? I always do those . It ’s company policy — ”
117414	117437	117438	117438	She	36	“ What good is company policy if I might not have a damn company to run in a year because of this ? ”
117518	117525	117507	117507	I	0	“ I think you should go . ”
117536	117541	117507	117507	I	0	“ You ’re joking . ”
117542	117565	117566	117566	Her	36	“ It ’s for the best . You ’re nothing but a distraction that I do n’t have time for right now . ”
117571	117585	117566	117566	Her	36	“ A distraction ? All I ’ve done is try to help you . ”
117586	117602	117603	117603	She	36	“ Your job description says you ’re supposed to alleviate problems , not cause them . ”
117614	117620	117603	117603	She	36	“ That is n’t fair . ”
117621	117630	117631	117631	Her	36	“ Neither is life . Get over it . ”
117646	117695	117603	117603	She	36	“ I think you ’re making a mistake if you keep going today . If I were you , I would end it , circle back tomorrow , and see if you can meet with Yakura privately . He is more observant than you give him credit for . ”
117696	117725	117754	117754	She	1707	“ As much as I have appreciated your input up until this point , I ’m the boss . I can determine whether or not I should continue . ”
117726	117735	117754	117754	She	1707	“ We ’re supposed to be a team . ”
117736	117753	117754	117754	She	1707	“ We are , but every team has a leader , and it ’s not you . ”
117802	117815	117816	117816	Her	1707	“ No . You do n’t get to touch me right now . ”
117824	117868	117869	117869	Her	1707	“ So , is this how it ’s going to be ? You ’re going to punish me whenever you do n’t get your way ? What ’s next , withholding sex because I did something stupid like comment on your job performance ? ”
117873	117886	117869	117869	Her	1707	“ That ’s not my issue with you and you know it . ”
117887	117894	117798	117798	she	1707	“ Then what is your problem ? ”
117895	117990	118052	118052	she	1709	“ You do n’t trust me — not entirely that is . If you did , then you would listen to me because I ’ve spent two years helping you build this project from the ground up . I do n’t want you to ruin it because you ’re not thinking rationally . Today is n’t about beating your father or trying to talk over him . It ’s about showing Yakura that you will put family first , regardless of your personal feelings because it ’s in the best interest of the company . ”
117991	118047	118048	118048	Her	1709	“ I trusted your shitty plan and you failed , so do n’t lecture me on trust when you ’re the one to blame for my father being here in the first place . If you were as good at your job as you say you are , none of this would have ever happened . ”
118155	118162	118163	118163	She	36	“ Iris , I should n’t — ”
118199	118243	118187	118187	she	1709	“ I never thought I would be on the receiving end of your temper , but I should have known that being your wife would n’t save me from that kind of treatment . If anything , it makes it ten times worse . ”
118244	118267	118268	118268	She	36	“ I did n’t mean it . I was angry about the situation with my father and took it out on you . ”
118312	118317	118318	118318	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
118401	118407	118408	118408	Her	36	“ Please do n’t cry . ”
118422	118428	118413	118413	she	36	“ You ’re not laughing . ”
118429	118432	118413	118413	she	36	“ What ? ”
118433	118445	118446	118446	Her	36	“ You told me you laugh when you make people cry . ”
118634	118640	118641	118641	she	36	“ Let go of me , ”
118692	118699	118700	118700	She	36	“ We can talk this out . ”
118748	118787	118788	118788	My	0	“ I ’ve been called a failure by many people in my life , including my own father , yet none of them seemed to have made it hurt quite like you just did . I trusted you . ”
118803	118808	118809	118809	She	36	“ I ’m sorr — ”
118814	118895	118809	118809	She	36	“ The last thing I want to hear right now is how sorry you are . I ca n’t believe I came here thinking you needed my help , only to end up being blamed for all of this . What a joke . The only two people to blame here are you and your father . Him for being an absolute dick and you for following in his footsteps , lashing out at me instead of taking personal responsibility . ”
118920	118925	118926	118926	She	36	“ Do n’t go . ”
118939	118948	118931	118931	she	36	“ We ’re supposed to be a team . ”
118949	118963	118931	118931	she	36	“ I do n’t want to be on your team . Not anymore . ”
118986	118992	118976	118976	she	36	“ I ’ll be better . ”
118993	119016	119017	119017	Her	36	“ Funny . That ’s what my father always told my mom too , right before he hurt her all over again . ”
119247	119255	119240	119241	Mrs. Yakura	172	“ She was n’t feeling very well . ”
119281	119295	119296	119297	Mr. Yakura	35	“ Oh no . Does she need help getting back to your hotel ? ”
119305	119318	119300	119300	I	0	“ She did n’t want us to stop our tour for her . ”
119319	119327	119328	119328	I	0	“ Are you sure ? We could — ”
119333	119338	119328	119328	I	0	“ I ’m sure . ”
119339	119345	119346	119347	Mrs. Yakura	172	“ Hopefully she feels better . ”
120598	120610	120593	120593	He	896	“ Hey . What are you doing back here so soon ? ”
120626	120630	120631	120631	He	896	“ Oh shit . ”
120699	120723	120691	120691	He	896	“ He ’s an idiot for telling you all that crap . The only thing that was shitty about today was his attitude . ”
120739	120745	120724	120724	I	0	“ He said I failed . ”
120746	120772	120773	120773	I	0	“ He failed you the moment he lost control like that . No one should talk to you like that , least of all him . ”
120776	120784	120773	120773	I	0	“ He was so mad at me . ”
120785	120805	120806	120806	My	0	“ I do n’t give a fuck how he felt . It does n’t make any of it okay . ”
120810	120816	120817	120817	Cal	720	“ I made a mistake . ”
120847	120851	120828	120828	He	720	“ Thank you . ”
120871	120893	120866	120866	he	720	“ It ’s the least I can do seeing as I ’m the one that encouraged him to chase after you . ”
120894	120901	120866	120866	he	720	“ It ’s not your fault . ”
120902	120911	120912	120912	I	0	“ I knew he did n’t deserve you . ”
120924	120927	120912	120912	I	0	“ I — ”
120928	120951	120952	120952	I	0	“ Do n’t make excuses for him . The things he said are unacceptable , especially after everything you shared with him . ”
120958	120968	120952	120952	I	0	“ Do you mind if I stay here tonight ? ”
120969	120983	120984	120984	I	0	“ Guest room is all yours for as long as you want it . ”
120987	120996	120984	120984	I	0	“ I ca n’t hide out here forever . ”
120997	121011	120952	120952	I	0	“ You can do whatever you want . Declan is n’t your keeper . ”
121012	121024	120952	120952	I	0	“ I know but I need to be mature about this . ”
121025	121039	120984	120984	I	0	“ Oh , like he ’s one to talk about maturity right now . ”
121040	121054	121055	121055	He	0	“ We ’re married . One fight is n’t going to change that . ”
121062	121076	121055	121055	He	0	“ No , but it might change the way you approach your marriage . ”
121077	121081	121082	121082	I	0	“ I know . ”
121099	121107	121090	121090	He	0	“ Everything is going to be okay . ”
121108	121159	121055	121055	He	0	“ Is it ? Because it sure as hell does n’t feel okay . He did n’t even come after me after everything he said . He just let me walk away like I did n’t mean anything to him , all because a deal is more important than me . ”
121173	121187	121055	121055	He	0	“ He fucked up . There ’s no easy way to put it . ”
121188	121196	121090	121090	He	0	“ What am I supposed to do ? ”
121197	121243	121244	121244	My	0	“ You do n’t need to do anything . He ’s the one who messed up , not the other way around . I know you ’re used to always picking up after his messes , but sometimes you ca n’t fix everything for him . ”
121248	121257	121244	121244	My	0	“ What if he does n’t fix it ? ”
121258	121271	121273	121273	DECLAN	402	“ Then he was never worthy of you in the first place . ”
121716	121723	121724	121724	He	258	“ Declan . Is everything okay ? ”
121741	121746	121724	121724	He	258	“ I ’m fine . ”
121747	121788	121736	121736	his	258	“ I could n’t help noticing how you ’ve been much quieter since Iris left . While I appreciate you spending the day with us , we would rather you be with your wife if she is n’t feeling well . ”
121800	121809	121736	121736	his	258	“ She wanted me to see this through . ”
121820	121867	121816	121816	His	258	“ I expected as much . She was rather persuasive on the phone when she was setting up this entire trip for us . I almost felt bad for inviting your father along , knowing the two of you are n’t on the best of terms . ”
121872	121876	121816	121816	His	258	“ Repeat that . ”
121877	121901	121816	121816	His	258	“ I was the one who invited your father to join us here . Why else did you think he would show up ? ”
121902	121909	121910	121911	Mr. Yakura	35	“ When did you do that ? ”
121916	121986	121910	121911	Mr. Yakura	35	“ The same day Iris called to schedule everything with my assistant . I wanted to make sure everyone could make it here for the announcement . It ’s a shame Iris wo n’t be here though . I know how hard she worked on putting all this together and I hate the idea of leaving here without telling her that this decision had nothing to do with her . ”
122074	122081	122051	122051	One	368	“ Why would you do that ? ”
122082	122102	122104	122104	him	258	“ I was curious about how you and your father worked together . Turns out my theories were right . ”
122176	122220	122170	122170	He	258	“ I can tell this news upsets you . I promise I did n’t mean for you to take any offense . My intention was solely to better understand the family dynamics before I made a decision to work with either of you . ”
122221	122233	122234	122234	His	258	“ And let me guess — you do n’t want to . ”
122239	122294	122234	122234	His	258	“ It ’s not that I do n’t want to , but your relationship with your father is complex . I can tell there is a lot of animosity between the two of you , although both of you try to pretend it does n’t exist . It became more apparent once Iris left . ”
122354	122368	122327	122338	A stupid idiot who drove away the one person in your corner	1789	“ Did you even come here with the intention of signing a contract ? ”
122369	122445	122446	122446	My	0	“ I did come with an open mind . My wife and I were both rooting for you , but I see there is still a lot you need to overcome . You ’re young , Declan . Young and ambitious and passionate enough to have what it takes to be a leader one day . No one is discounting that , although I ’m sure it might feel like that because of my decision . ”
122457	122461	122446	122446	My	0	“ I see . ”
122462	122494	122495	122495	I	0	“ I doubt you want to hear this from me , but if you do n’t mind , I want to give you advice from one CEO to a future one . ”
122506	122510	122511	122511	He	0	“ Go ahead . ”
122526	122623	122521	122521	I	0	“ You ’re only as strong as your biggest fear . Take your father for example : he is afraid of being powerless , so he will go out of his way to ruin his own child ’s success just to feel strong and relevant . It will be his greatest downfall one day — I can guarantee that . So choose to learn from him and his mistakes before it ’s too late for you . Embrace your fears and grow from them or spend the rest of your life fighting them at every turn . ”
122640	122645	122646	122646	He	0	“ What ’s mine ? ”
122649	122679	122646	122646	He	0	“ Go do some soul searching and find out for yourself . I ca n’t just give you all the answers . That ’s the whole point of life . ”
122698	122703	122704	122704	He	0	“ One last thing . ”
122721	122724	122704	122704	He	0	“ What ? ”
122725	122768	122769	122769	He	0	“ Come back and talk to me when you feel the time is right . If the gossip articles my wife reads are correct , then maybe it ’s sooner rather than later . Hopefully you have yourself sorted out by then . ”
122792	122812	122813	122813	He	0	“ Go take care of your wife . Tell her I ’m sorry and that I hope she understands . ”
122846	122860	122837	122837	I	0	“ How does it feel to lose something you worked two years on ? ”
122861	122896	122897	122897	His	258	“ Not nearly as pathetic as you must feel going home to an empty house , knowing you only have your miserable self to keep you company . I ’ll see you on Monday . ”
122903	122909	122897	122897	His	258	“ Where are you going ? ”
122910	122943	122944	122944	He	258	“ I ’m done here . I tried and I lost . If you ’ll excuse me , I ’m going to get my wife and get the hell out of here . ”
122957	122963	122964	122964	I	0	“ Do n’t touch me , ”
122967	122974	122964	122964	I	0	“ We ’re not done here . ”
122975	123000	122897	122897	His	258	“ If you ’re looking for some kind of big reaction from me , you ’re not going to get one . Not anymore . ”
123001	123025	123026	123026	I	0	“ Really ? I guess I ’ll have to wait for Monday then when you have to present your failure to the board . ”
123029	123079	123026	123026	I	0	“ It does n’t matter what they think about me . Half of them think you ’re a piece of shit and they still kiss your ass because of your last name . So long as I have my inheritance , their opinions of me are n’t worth shit . ”
123080	123099	122964	122964	I	0	“ And you consider this proving yourself ? It makes you look like a pathetic option for CEO . ”
123100	123118	123026	123026	I	0	“ Maybe , but it does n’t matter , does it ? Grandpa made sure of that . ”
123119	123132	123026	123026	I	0	“ I will fight you every step of the way on this . ”
123133	123203	123204	123204	I	0	“ You can sure try , but I ’m not planning on fighting back . I ’m done . You ’re a lost cause I refuse to spend any more energy on . I ’d rather redirect it to what ’s important like my wife , kids , and brothers . You made your choice to be a miserable fuck , but that does n’t mean I have to . ”
123417	123420	123408	123408	her	36	“ Shit . ”
123563	123566	123568	123568	DECLAN	402	“ Shit . ”

123814	123832	123833	123833	Rowan	715	“ Because I wanted to talk to him , but he did n’t want to be caught . ”

123965	123970	123971	123971	I	0	“ Fine . Speak . ”
123977	123991	123971	123971	I	0	“ Can we go inside first ? I need a glass of water . ”

124143	124151	124127	124127	Rowan	715	“ How do you stand living here ? ”
124152	124161	124190	124190	Zahra	2711	“ It reminds me of some good times . ”

124215	124233	124204	124204	She	2711	“ So , would anyone like to tell me why I ’m being held emotionally hostage here ? ”
124244	124287	124234	124234	Rowan	715	“ I lied when I said I had something to tell you . I was only hoping to stall you for as long as it took until Rowan got back so you both could talk this out , once and for all . ”

124434	124439	124406	124406	He	1814	“ Because I care . ”

124453	124504	124450	124450	He	1814	“ Love is n’t conditional . I know Father made us believe that , but just because I get angry at you and vice versa does n’t mean I do n’t love you or care about you . Even if you do act like an idiot most of the time . ”
124505	124518	124528	124528	He	1814	“ Who knew Dreamland would turn you into such a sappy fuck ? ”

As your big brother , I ’m supposed to set the example . Be the bigger person . Make the best choices . Stay strong no matter how much I ’m being beaten down . Except all I ’ve done is show you what not to do . Instead of letting you become your own person , I was trying to shove you back into a mold you did n’t fit into anymore . It was selfish of me , and I ’m sorry . ”
124851	124854	124855	124855	He	1822	“ Wow . ”

124921	124931	124918	124918	He	1822	“ Iris took the jet back to Chicago earlier . ”

124937	124957	124958	124958	I	0	“ Looks like you ’re flying commercial tonight . You better buy a ticket before you lose the chance . ”
125007	125012	124998	124998	I	0	“ I fucked up . ”
125013	125024	124979	124979	she	36	“ It ’s nothing some good groveling ca n’t fix . ”

125386	125393	125331	125331	Iris	36	“ Put her on the phone . ”
125394	125406	125331	125331	Iris	36	“ She does n’t want to talk to you right now . ”
125407	125418	125362	125362	My	0	“ I want to hear her tell me that herself . ”
125419	125451	125331	125331	Iris	36	“ Man , just listen to me . Go home and take the night to cool off . Both of you are too emotional to deal with one another right now . ”
125452	125456	125457	125457	I	0	“ Fuck this . ”

125694	125706	125686	125686	He	720	“ She does n’t want to deal with you right now . ”
125707	125719	125686	125686	He	720	“ So what ? You know what ’s best for her ? ”
125720	125775	125686	125686	He	720	“ One of us has to , seeing as you sure as hell do n’t . I knew you were n’t capable of taking care of her . I freaking knew it and I still helped you , thinking maybe you were really starting to change . That maybe you really did love her . ”
125776	125790	125686	125686	He	720	“ I do love her . Not that I owe you any explanation . ”
125791	125815	125686	125686	He	720	“ No , Declan . Clearly you do n’t if you called her a failure like every other disappointing fuck in her life . ”

125858	125926	125855	125855	He	0	“ You belittled your wife until she felt as worthless as you . You made her feel small , useless , and insignificant — all because you care more about your job than the person you claim to love . So all I can say is congratulations , Declan . You spent your whole life protecting us from our father , only to become just like him . ”
125927	125931	125932	125932	I	0	“ Fuck you . ”

126726	126733	126734	126734	My	0	“ Since you needed an assistant . ”
126739	126742	126734	126734	My	0	“ What ? ”
126743	126751	126707	126707	He	1990	“ Iris is n’t coming in today . ”

126800	126815	126707	126707	He	1990	“ Nope . She ’s taking a two - week vacation , starting today . ”
126816	126823	126824	126824	He	1990	“ No , she ’s not . ”
126828	126840	126824	126824	He	1990	“ Are you giving me a ride to work or not ? ”
126841	126848	126780	126780	I	0	“ Why are you enjoying this ? ”
126849	126888	126780	126780	I	0	“ Because it ’s nice to watch someone finally put you in your place . Did you really think you could talk to her the way you did and expect her to go into work for two weeks ? ”
126894	126902	126780	126780	I	0	“ I want to talk to her . ”
126903	126914	126931	126931	I	0	“ She ’ll speak to you when she ’s ready . ”
126915	126930	126931	126931	I	0	“ Then I guess I ’ll be the one to do the talking then . ”
126953	126956	126957	126957	I	0	“ Dec — ”
126979	126985	126986	126986	He	0	“ Open the damn door ! ”
127019	127026	127011	127011	Iris	36	“ What are you doing here ? ”
127027	127033	127034	127034	I	0	“ I brought you coffee . ”
127055	127064	127044	127044	She	36	“ You came here to bring me coffee ? ”
127065	127085	127011	127011	Iris	36	“ No . I came here to talk to you . Coffee is merely a bribe for your time . ”
127086	127097	127044	127044	She	36	“ I do n’t want your bribes . Not anymore . ”
127098	127104	127044	127044	She	36	“ Fine . Maybe later . ”
127112	127123	127044	127044	She	36	“ Should I even ask how you got in here ? ”
127124	127135	127044	127044	She	36	“ I stole Cal ’s keys and locked him out . ”
127136	127139	127011	127011	Iris	36	“ Declan — ”
127140	127145	127044	127044	She	36	“ I miss you . ”

127163	127179	127180	127180	She	1863	“ The addiction gene runs strong in my family . Take pity on your husband . ”
127208	127251	127196	127196	she	1863	“ I miss you so damn much , I do n’t know what to do with myself . The house is too quiet and the bathroom is far too clean . Even pasta does n’t taste the same without you cooking it . ”
127252	127270	127196	127196	she	1863	“ I do n’t cook . I boil . That ’s a big difference according to you . ”
127271	127296	127297	127297	Her	1863	“ Come home . I ’ll cook every day for the rest of our lives so long as you agree to not leave again . ”
127301	127304	127305	127305	I	0	“ No . ”
127339	127348	127349	127349	She	1863	“ Please . I ’m miserable without you . ”
127355	127361	127349	127349	She	1863	“ I ’m not ready . ”

127420	127428	127384	127384	she	1863	“ What ’s there to think about ? ”
127429	127436	127384	127384	she	1863	“ You . Me . Us . ”
127437	127442	127384	127384	she	1863	“ What about us ? ”
127443	127456	127457	127457	My	0	“ Whether or not there was even an us to begin with . ”
127483	127489	127477	127477	I	0	“ You signed a contract . ”
127490	127510	127477	127477	I	0	“ Our deal never said anything about being in a real relationship . You yourself called it a game . ”
127511	127523	127527	127527	her	1863	“ This is n’t a fucking game and you know it . ”
127555	127565	127550	127550	She	1863	“ I do n’t know what to believe anymore . ”
127566	127586	127587	127587	Her	1863	“ So what ? You just want to go back to how things were before we fell in love ? ”
127616	127639	127610	127610	I	0	“ Go ahead and take your time , but nothing is going to change the fact that you and I are inevitable . ”
127747	127750	127733	127733	Cal	720	“ Yes ? ”
127751	127759	127760	127760	I	0	“ Are you going to sign it ? ”
127771	127777	127778	127778	He	720	“ I plan on it . ”
127788	127798	127778	127778	He	720	“ You can go back to your desk now . ”
127799	127816	127733	127733	Cal	720	“ And miss all this internal conflict and angst ? What do you take me for ? ”
127817	127823	127824	127824	He	720	“ A dead man walking . ”
127827	127852	127824	127824	He	720	“ Watching you struggle to cope with all this is far too entertaining to pass up , especially given how miserable you made Iris . ”
127853	127868	127869	127869	His	720	“ Can you please leave me alone ? I ’m not in the mood . ”
127970	127977	127978	127979	My brother	1990	“ This is for the best . ”
128012	128027	128001	128001	he	1990	“ She ’s not coming back . Saving her chair wo n’t change that . ”
128028	128051	127995	127995	He	1990	“ She ’s still my wife . That chair is hers regardless of her occupation status , so use the other one . ”
128052	128059	128001	128001	he	1990	“ Is she still your wife ? ”
128060	128064	128065	128065	I	0	“ Get out , ”
128071	128077	128068	128068	He	1990	“ I ’m just asking . ”
128078	128088	128001	128001	he	1990	“ No , you ’re looking for a fight . ”
128089	128115	128001	128001	he	1990	“ Maybe I am . At least that way we can settle this . I do n’t like working with all this tension around us . ”
128116	128139	128068	128068	He	1990	“ There is nothing to settle . This is between me and her , regardless of whatever impression you might be under . ”
128140	128178	128179	128179	My	0	“ She came to me crying , Declan . I ’m not going to sweep that under the rug because you decided a little too late that you made the wrong choice and you want her back . ”
128186	128195	128179	128179	My	0	“ I ’m not doing this with you . ”
128196	128206	128207	128207	I	0	“ Then sign the paper and I ’ll leave . ”
128236	128250	128231	128231	Cal	720	“ If you really love her , then this needs to be done . ”
128251	128258	128231	128231	Cal	720	“ Even if it feels wrong ? ”
128259	128281	128231	128231	Cal	720	“ Of course it feels wrong . You ’ve both been co - dependent on one another for far too long . ”
128282	128295	128231	128231	Cal	720	“ At least all that rehab I paid for taught you something . ”
128325	128372	128320	128320	He	720	“ This job should n’t be the thing that keeps you together just like it should n’t be the reason that drives you apart . So , if you want a chance at a successful marriage , you need to let her go as your employee . ”
128387	128390	128320	128320	He	720	“ Here . ”
128406	128412	128320	128320	He	720	“ It ’ll be okay . ”
128413	128442	128443	128443	I	0	“ It sure as fuck does n’t feel okay . Not when it feels like I ’m losing her before I ever even had her to begin with , ”
128450	128461	128446	128446	His	720	“ It ’s not too late to get her back . ”
128462	128468	128320	128320	He	720	“ How do you know ? ”
128469	128487	128446	128446	His	720	“ Because for some goddamn reason , she loves you despite all the reasons she should n’t . ”
128488	128494	128446	128446	His	720	“ She never told me . ”
128495	128498	128320	128320	He	720	“ What ? ”
128499	128508	128509	128509	My	0	“ She never told me she loved me . ”
128513	128523	128524	128524	He	720	“ That does n’t mean she still ca n’t . ”
129659	129664	129665	129665	Cal	720	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
129671	129674	129665	129665	Cal	720	“ Nothing . ”
129675	129682	129683	129683	I	0	“ Declan sent you another message ? ”

129811	129816	129817	129817	He	720	“ You miss him . ”
129824	129856	129817	129817	He	720	“ Of course I miss him . I miss him so damn much it makes me sick to my stomach because I feel guilty for wanting him in the first place . ”
129857	129867	129799	129799	I	0	“ Then why do n’t you speak to him ? ”
129868	129908	129909	129909	My	0	“ Because I trusted my heart before and look where it got me . Now I ’m doubting everything . If this is what love feels like , then I do n’t want it because it really fucking hurts . ”
129922	129930	129915	129915	Cal	720	“ Everything is going to be okay . ”
129931	129939	129940	129940	His	720	“ How can you be so sure ? ”
129946	129971	129940	129940	His	720	“ Because if Declan loves you half as much as you love him , then he will stop at nothing to make this right . ”
130069	130078	130079	130079	She	453	“ Well , is n’t this a surprise . ”
130087	130094	130079	130079	She	453	“ I wanted to see you . ”
130095	130099	130100	130100	She	453	“ What happened ? ”
130114	130117	130118	130118	She	453	“ Nothing … ”
130129	130132	130133	130133	She	453	“ Sit . ”
130176	130197	130159	130159	she	453	“ As much as I love you stopping by to see me , I ca n’t help but wonder why . ”
130198	130210	130159	130159	she	453	“ Do I need an excuse to come visit my mother ? ”
130211	130228	130229	130229	I	0	“ Seeing as you have n’t visited my classroom for three years , yes you do . ”

130250	130261	130229	130229	I	0	“ Declan and I got into a fight last week . ”

130271	130288	130229	130229	I	0	“ Things got a bit too real and honest , if you know what I mean . ”
130297	130306	130307	130307	I	0	“ He said some things that hurt you . ”
130333	130341	130342	130342	My	0	“ I ca n’t help but wonder … ”
130355	130367	130368	130368	she	1902	“ Whether he might turn out to be like your father , ”
130373	130376	130377	130377	She	1902	“ Yes . ”
130388	130495	130377	130377	She	1902	“ It ’s a normal fear after everything you ’ve witnessed between your father and me , but you need to understand that couples fight . It ’s a part of any healthy relationship . That does n’t mean the other person should ever talk down to you or intentionally hurt you , but people make mistakes . This is n’t going to be the first or last time Declan says something he does n’t mean in the heat of the moment . But so long as he is sorry — and I mean truly sorry — then you need to learn how to forgive him . ”
130496	130503	130504	130504	She	1902	“ Easy for you to say . ”
130511	130529	130533	130533	Portuguese	183	“ Learning how to forgive is just as important as asking for it in the first place . ”
130649	130655	130656	130656	Cal	720	“ Where are you going ? ”
130663	130674	130656	130656	Cal	720	“ I ’m taking the rest of the day off . ”
130675	130678	130656	130656	Cal	720	“ What ? ”
130679	130697	130656	130656	Cal	720	“ Please cancel my appointments for the remainder of the workday . I wo n’t be available . ”
130698	130704	130656	130656	Cal	720	“ All eight of them ? ”
130705	130711	130656	130656	Cal	720	“ Is that a problem ? ”

130749	130774	130739	130740	my brother	1990	“ Thanks for helping me out . I know you do n’t have to , but I appreciate you stepping in for Iris nonetheless . ”
130775	130786	130739	130740	my brother	1990	“ I ’m doing it for Iris . Not you . ”
130787	130800	130801	130801	I	0	“ I know , which is why I appreciate it even more . ”
130880	130890	130891	130891	Harrison	896	“ Maybe we can try again tomorrow , sir . ”
130961	130976	130977	130977	Harrison	896	“ Let ’s try one more and then I ’ll call it a day . ”

131065	131070	131054	131054	She	1915	“ We ’re closed . ”
131079	131093	131094	131094	Her	1915	“ You ’re still open for another thirty minutes , so try again . ”
131114	131121	131102	131102	she	1915	“ How can I help you ? ”
131122	131137	131102	131102	she	1915	“ I ’m looking for a big , fluffy dog that has separation anxiety . ”
131138	131144	131102	131102	she	1915	“ That ’s oddly specific . ”
131145	131161	131102	131102	she	1915	“ Tell me about it . Do you have any dog that fits my description ? ”
131162	131171	131102	131102	she	1915	“ Umm … not that I know of . ”
131231	131241	131223	131223	I	0	“ I see . Thanks for your time then . ”
131242	131256	131257	131257	I	0	“ Do you want to take a look out back just in case ? ”
131293	131300	131301	131301	She	1920	“ Fine . Lead the way . ”
131349	131355	131341	131341	others	2059	“ See any you like ? ”
131356	131359	131360	131362	All of them	1924	“ No . ”
131388	131393	131380	131381	A dog	1925	“ What ’s that ? ”
131394	131420	131341	131341	others	2059	“ That pen is reserved for the dog being prepped for euthanasia . He ’s probably a bit anxious about being separated from everyone else . ”
131421	131428	131429	131429	We	1926	“ You plan on killing him ? “
131458	131492	131455	131455	You	1929	” Jesus . I take a step toward the final cage . Two dark eyes look up at me , barely observable from behind a mop of white and gray hair covering him . “
131501	131510	131513	131513	he	1930	” She comes over and checks the nameplate . “
131527	131559	131563	131563	him	1930	” He looks old all right . Based on the card , his estimated date of birth was more than five years ago . That ’s practically ancient in dog years . “
131566	131567	131563	131563	him	1930	” “
131579	131606	131572	131572	He	1930	” With the way her eyes keep darting around the room , one would think she requires some kind of taser wand to handle a dog . “
131612	131686	131572	131572	He	1930	” She shrugs before unlocking the cage . The dog barrels out like a bullet before slamming into me . I try to catch myself but end up falling flat on my ass as the dog licks my entire face from chin to hairline . It ’s absolutely repulsive , yet I ca n’t help laughing when he repeats the gesture on the other side of my face , leaving no area unlicked . “
131695	131696	131572	131572	He	1930	” “
131703	131744	131572	131572	He	1930	” The dog whimpers as if he can understand the conversation . He takes a seat on my lap like a small dog , only to crush my cock beneath his weight . I push him off me and stand . “
131752	131753	131572	131572	He	1930	” “
131756	131763	131572	131572	He	1930	” She reviews his card again . “
131807	131859	131860	131860	I	0	” Great . Mystery solved . He blinks up at me like he silently promises to be on his best behavior . I ’m having a hard time believing him based on the way he drools all over my shoes like he wants to make them his new favorite chew toy . “
131876	131877	131860	131860	I	0	” “
131885	131886	131880	131880	you	1933	” “
131894	132003	131880	131880	you	1933	” I ’m now the proud father of a clingy dog who will most likely destroy my home before Iris ever has a chance to come back to it . Perfect . Just perfect . * * * The next day , I show up to work with the dog who has yet to be named . After he destroyed my favorite loafer while I was out on my evening run , he ca n’t be trusted around nice things . Bringing him to the office is a temporary solution . One I need to fix soon once I find the appropriate doggy day care to train him . “
132008	132016	131880	131880	you	1933	” Cal stops by my office door . “
132020	132051	131880	131880	you	1933	” I do n’t look up from my computer . The dog barks in reply . He tries to break free from his leash attached to my desk but fails . “
132066	132067	132068	132068	He	1935	” “
132073	132081	132083	132083	he	1935	” The dog barks again in agreement . “
132086	132095	132097	132097	Iris	36	” Cal takes a hesitant step toward it . “
132100	132101	132097	132097	Iris	36	” “

132195	132200	132157	132157	I	0	” My eyes narrow . “

132252	132265	132241	132241	I	0	” He pats the dog ’s head . I glare at him . “

132402	132440	132398	132398	we	1940	” When Cal asked me to go on an errand with him , I thought he meant a quick trip to the grocery store . We have long passed the grocery store and any sign of civilization . “
132443	132460	132398	132398	we	1940	” He taps the steering wheel to the beat of the music streaming from the radio . “
132474	132478	132398	132398	we	1940	” He laughs . “
132487	132496	132485	132485	Max	187	” A lightning bolt cuts across the sky . “

132508	132516	132485	132485	Max	187	” he replies with a dry voice . “

132587	132611	132579	132579	I	0	” I do n’t move a muscle . Cal hops out of the car and circles around the hood to open my door . “

132625	132626	132617	132617	We	1940	” “

132681	132733	132666	132666	him	0	” I look around , trying to find the him Cal speaks of . My comment goes unanswered as Cal jumps into his car and does a dramatic U - turn away from me . His tires squeal as he accelerates down the road , leaving me choking on car exhaust . “
132738	132771	132666	132666	him	0	” I grab my phone from my purse and dial his number . The dick sends me straight to voicemail . I start talking the moment it beeps to leave a message . “
132784	132838	132772	132772	You	1935	” My rant is cut off by a car driving down the road . I ’ve seen enough crime documentaries to know nothing good comes from hitchhiking with a stranger . I search the perimeter for somewhere to hide , except I ’m surrounded by flat land and a few pieces of garbage . “
132858	132921	132841	132841	Cal	720	” As the car gets closer , I realize it is n’t a car at all , but a white minivan . One that looks awfully similar to those serial killer vans everyone warns women to stay away from . My heart pounds harder against my chest , fighting for a way to get out . I cross my fingers and whisper , “
132938	132953	132841	132841	Cal	720	” I startle at the sound of a horn followed by a loud bark . “
132958	132970	132841	132841	Cal	720	” My eyes widen at the sound of Declan ’s voice . “
132975	133009	132841	132841	Cal	720	” I bite down on my tongue and a metallic taste immediately floods my mouth . I guess this is really happening . Declan steps out of the vehicle wearing his best suit . “
133034	133080	133025	133025	you	1942	” He leans against the hood of the car like this is n’t the weirdest situation ever . I open my mouth to ask why Cal set me up , only to be cut off by a clap of lightning . He raises a brow . “
133094	133108	133025	133025	you	1942	” I stomp my way toward the passenger side and open the door . “

133137	133165	133120	133120	I	0	” I take a seat before the sky opens up above us . He does n’t answer me as he shuts my door with a small smile . “
133168	133242	133120	133120	I	0	” My reply is cut off by a dog barking . I check out the back seat and find a massive dog attached to some kind of animal car seat . He is covered in fur from head to paws , and I can barely make out his eyes due to his giant poof . I ’m surprised he can even fit in the back seat based on the sheer size of him . “
133248	133257	133258	133258	Ours	1945	” I ask when he opens his door . “
133260	133261	133262	133262	Ours	1945	” “
133265	133297	133262	133262	Ours	1945	” The dog barks with a reply . I ’m not even going to touch that comment . Instead , I search the directions for the nearest Starbucks on my phone . “
133302	133316	133317	133317	Declan	402	” He completely ignores my map as he turns in the opposite direction . “
133319	133320	133317	133317	Declan	402	” “
133337	133424	133317	133317	Declan	402	” I ’m thrown back into the memory of the last time he asked for ten minutes but gave me ten words instead . I am falling in love with you , Iris Elizabeth Kane . The memory makes me compliant enough to keep quiet as he drives us down the road . Gray clouds part above us . Rain falls against the windshield , and Declan is forced to turn on the wipers to see clearly . The dog whimpers at the sound of thunder . “
133432	133433	133434	133434	You	0	” “
133440	133452	133434	133434	You	0	” My mouth drops open , and no words come out . “
133511	133561	133498	133498	They	1947	” A laugh bursts out of me before I can swallow it . When I made up the story of the dog , I never really thought Declan would actually go out and find one for me . Let alone adopt one that is the size of a bear . “
133568	133576	133498	133498	They	1947	” My voice cracking mirrors my resolve . “
133590	133591	133593	133594	the minivan	1948	” “
133596	133597	133593	133594	the minivan	1948	” “
133618	133624	133625	133625	You	0	” My vision turns misty . “

133644	133748	133634	133634	I	0	” He stays silent as he presses a foot on the accelerator . The rest of the ride is a bumpy one . I ’m grateful when Declan stops the van before I throw up from carsickness . He parks us in front of an old farmhouse with boarded - up windows and a porch that looks about ready to collapse . With the way he gets out of the car without an umbrella , I could almost forget it ’s raining . He does n’t seem the least bit bothered by it as he opens my door and holds out his hand . “
133753	133760	133634	133634	I	0	” I blink up at him . “
133765	133766	133767	133767	I	0	” “
133777	133879	133767	133767	I	0	” He grabs onto my hand and tugs me out of the car . Raindrops splash against my skin . Declan leads me away from the car , although we do n’t make it very far before he stops in front of the worn - down porch . Water clings to his hair , skin , and clothes . I ’m not sure I look any better with the way my T - shirt is plastered against my body . I ’m tempted to seek shelter on the porch , but the wood looks warped and decayed from years of neglect . “
133885	133886	133767	133767	I	0	” “

133903	133937	133894	133894	I	0	” His hand gripping onto mine tugs and rotates my stack of rings until they both slip off . An unbearable tightness in my chest intensifies as I check out my ringless finger . “
133940	133991	133894	133894	I	0	” Declan pulls out a ring box from his jacket and gets down on one knee . His face remains a blank canvas , completely devoid of any visible emotion as he looks up at me . My heart pounds against my chest as he latches onto my left hand . “
133997	133998	133894	133894	I	0	” “
134014	134077	134078	134078	Iris	36	” Oh . My . God . No way . There is no freaking way he is recreating the story I made up . Right ? Wrong . He pops open the ring box , and I gasp . Even without the sun shining down on it , I can tell he bought the most beautiful emerald ring I ’ve ever seen . “
134080	134081	134078	134078	Iris	36	” “
134084	134148	134149	134149	Ya'aburnee1	188	” I drag my eyes away from the ring and back toward his face . His hand holding onto mine trembles , and I know it has nothing to do with the rain . I give him a reassuring squeeze . He mumbles something that sounds like here goes nothing , and my chest caves in on itself at his display of vulnerability . “
134272	134351	134355	134355	his	35	“ I want to be the kind of man who is worthy of a woman like you — if it ’s even possible . I promise to work every damn day to make sure you do n’t regret marrying someone as miserable as me . Because when I ’m with you , I ’m not miserable at all . You make me happy in a way that makes me afraid to blink just in case it all disappears . ”
134366	134431	134355	134355	his	35	“ I ’ll give you anything you want — anything at all — so long as you give me a chance to make you as happy as you make me . A dog . A family . A home . I want it all . These are my terms and conditions , take it or leave it because I ’m not open to negotiations . ”
134432	134450	134456	134456	He	35	“ Only you could make a proposal sound like a business acquisition and get away with it . ”
134451	134455	134456	134456	He	35	“ Marry me . ”
134471	134478	134479	134479	My	0	“ I am married to you . ”
134498	134530	134531	134531	He	35	“ Marry me for real this time . No contract . No inheritance . No expectations other than for you to love me despite all the reasons you probably should n’t . ”

134659	134668	134655	134655	I	0	“ Yes . I want to marry you . ”
134708	134720	134721	134721	I	0	“ Those were the most excruciating thirty seconds of my life . ”
134724	134735	134736	134736	He	35	“ Serves you right after everything you put me through . ”
134865	134884	134860	134860	I	0	“ Are you going to tell me what we ’re doing out here in the middle of nowhere ? ”
134885	134892	134860	134860	I	0	“ Showing you our new home . ”

134961	134967	134958	134958	He	35	“ Do you like it ? ”
135045	135090	135029	135029	Declan	402	“ I thought about letting you pick a place , but when my real estate agent sent me this listing , I knew it was the one . I drove out the same day to check it out and put an offer on it . ”
135091	135094	135095	135095	I	0	“ Why ? ”
135098	135117	135118	135118	Declan	402	“ Because there is nothing I want more than to turn a house into a home with you . ”
135137	135142	135143	135143	His	402	“ It ’s beautiful . ”
135149	135156	135143	135143	His	402	“ Want to check it out ? ”

135355	135379	135380	135380	I	0	“ Good . Because if my proposal did n’t work , this was my next best option to convince you to marry me . ”

135402	135416	135398	135398	His	402	“ I do n’t want other people ’s love . I want yours . ”
135417	135423	135424	135424	He	402	“ You already have it . ”
