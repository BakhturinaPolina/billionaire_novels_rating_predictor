910	913	914	914	I	191	“ Hey ! ”
968	973	974	974	he	191	“ What the hell ? ”
986	993	974	974	he	191	“ Who the hell do you — ”
994	1006	1007	1007	I	191	“ Sorry . You could n’t hear me over the music . ”
1033	1037	1020	1020	I	191	“ Logan Brantley ? ”
1043	1057	1058	1058	He	191	“ Holly Wickman . Have n’t seen you in a coon ’s age . ”
1097	1103	1104	1104	He	191	“ Hold on a sec . ”
1284	1306	1307	1307	He	1099	“ Of all the gin joints . . . What the hell are you doing in my garage , Holly Wix ? ”
1418	1421	1422	1422	Logan	1099	“ Holly ? ”
1430	1472	1473	1473	I	191	“ Sorry . I , um , my car wo n’t start . I was getting gas , and then I got back in and turned the key , and just nothing . Well , a click , but then nothing . ”
1499	1509	1510	1510	He	1099	“ A click . Bad starter then , probably . ”
1527	1557	1522	1522	my	191	“ What kind of hot ride you got these days ? I could see you in a Lexus . You always were classier than the other girls around here . ”
1563	1568	1558	1558	My	191	“ Me ? Classy ? ”
1708	1743	1700	1700	Logan	1099	“ Yeah , you . You ’ve always been a class act . Although these days , I ’m probably wrong about the Lexus . I bet you ’re rollin ’ in a Bentley . ”
1766	1779	1700	1700	Logan	1099	“ Yeah , I could see a Bentley suiting you just fine . ”
1828	1835	1861	1861	He	1099	“ No Bentley . No Lexus . ”
1864	1880	1861	1861	He	1099	“ All - righty then . Let ’s go see what we ’re working with . ”
1901	1914	1881	1881	I	191	“ Please , woman , tell me that ai n’t your ride . ”
1925	1935	1915	1915	I	191	“ Sorry it ’s not up to your standards . ”
1950	1964	1936	1936	He	1099	“ It ai n’t up to your standards — that ’s the problem . ”
1968	1982	1965	1965	I	191	“ The high life is n’t always as glamorous as you ’d think . ”
2011	2014	2015	2015	He	1099	“ Keys ? ”
2068	2081	2045	2045	he	1099	“ Um , there was a clunk too . After the click . ”
2082	2116	2045	2045	he	1099	“ Yep . Starter or the solenoid ’s shot . I can order one , but I wo n’t be able to get the part until Monday at the earliest . Maybe Tuesday . ”
2134	2142	2045	2045	he	1099	“ Okay . I really appreciate it . ”
2151	2180	2143	2143	He	1099	“ Happy to help out the hometown girl who made good . I ’ll get Johnny from the gas station to help me push it into the garage . ”
2181	2197	2143	2143	He	1099	“ Thank you . Seriously . That ’s one less thing to worry about then . ”
2274	2276	2267	2267	Logan	1099	“ stop ”
2279	2287	2267	2267	Logan	1099	“ What the hell are you doing ? ”
2294	2301	2288	2288	My	191	“ Going to Gran ’s house . ”
2302	2306	2267	2267	Logan	1099	“ On foot ? ”
2307	2314	2288	2288	My	191	“ It ’s not that far . ”
2315	2340	2267	2267	Logan	1099	“ It ’s cold as shit , and it ’s at least three miles if it ’s a step . You ai n’t walking . ”
2356	2388	2288	2288	My	191	“ I ’m not sure when you decided it was cool to make decisions for me , but I ’m just going to do whatever the hell I want , thanks . ”
2389	2397	2288	2288	My	191	“ Holly , do n’t be ridiculous . ”
2417	2461	2462	2462	My	191	“ Do you not recognize the signs of a woman about to break ? Because I ’m hanging on by a thread here , and the last goddamn thing I need is another man telling me what I can or ca n’t do . ”
2481	2488	2462	2462	My	191	“ Whoa . Honey . Calm — ”
2489	2496	2462	2462	My	191	“ Do n’t even . . . ”
2520	2532	2533	2533	He	1099	“ I ’ll give you a ride . If you want . ”
2553	2559	2560	2560	Logan	1099	“ Okay . Thank you . ”
2714	2716	2696	2696	He	1099	“ downtown ”
2731	2733	2722	2722	I	191	“ downtown ”
2885	2903	2875	2875	I	191	“ Guess you know you ’ve made it when you hear yourself on your hometown radio station . ”
2909	2929	2904	2904	Logan	1099	“ That ’s satellite . Local station plays you all the damn time . Do n’t play much else . ”
2930	2933	2904	2904	Logan	1099	“ Oh . ”
2950	2972	2940	2940	He	1099	“ I always knew you ’d make something of yourself . Glad you took your shot when you had the chance . ”
2981	2993	2973	2973	He	1099	“ Even if it did put you out of my reach . ”
3040	3062	3037	3037	he	1099	“ So , what the hell are you doing here , looking like you been rode hard and put up wet ? ”
3073	3084	3063	3063	I	191	“ And here I thought you said I looked good . ”
3099	3120	3085	3085	He	1099	“ Oh , you do , but you look tired , strung out — and you ’re short a husband . ”
3147	3154	3155	3155	I	191	“ I just needed a break , ”
3158	3177	3155	3155	I	191	“ I needed to step away for a little while and sort some stuff out . By myself . ”
3215	3231	3207	3207	He	1099	“ I would ’ve thought this was the last place you ’d come running to . ”
3281	3338	3263	3263	I	191	“ I guess when you decide to make a run for it , the most natural place in the world to run is back to your roots . I ’ve only been gone nine months , but so much has changed . I wanted a bigger life , and boy , did I ever get it . ”
3358	3402	3420	3420	he	228	“ But it ’s gotten so big , it ’s like I do n’t know who I am anymore . I thought if I came back here , maybe that would give me the answers I ca n’t seem to find anywhere else . ”
3403	3411	3339	3339	I	191	“ You made a run for it ? ”
3425	3432	3412	3412	I	191	“ It ’s a long story . ”
3621	3655	3600	3600	Logan	1099	“ Thanks . For the ride and for the help with the car . You can leave a message on Gran ’s machine when it ’s ready . I ’ll be checking it . ”
3656	3662	3663	3663	He	1099	“ Ai n’t no trouble . ”
3700	3706	3697	3697	Logan	1099	“ Be ready at eight . ”
3707	3712	3697	3697	Logan	1099	“ Wha — what ? ”
3713	3718	3697	3697	Logan	1099	“ You heard me . ”
3719	3727	3697	3697	Logan	1099	“ But I . . . What ? ”
3728	3746	3697	3697	Logan	1099	“ You came back to find your roots , Holly . I ’m gon na reintroduce ya . ”
3858	3870	3852	3852	I	191	“ What the hell ? How ’d you get in here ? ”
3871	3907	3935	3935	He	1099	“ Told you I was coming at eight . Figured you would n’t be ready , so I came early . Now get your ass out of bed . We got places to go tonight . ”
3908	3934	3852	3852	I	191	“ What part of me ignoring you for the last fifteen minutes has n’t clued you in to the fact that I ’m not going ? ”
3956	3989	3935	3935	He	1099	“ You came here for a reason . I recognize someone looking to hide away and lick her wounds , but that do n’t help much . Trust me . I know . ”
4008	4020	3997	3997	I	191	“ You ’re really going to drag me out of here ? ”
4021	4053	4087	4087	His	191	“ Kicking and screaming , if I have to . Given that any picture of you is going to end up online somewhere , you might want to fix your makeup . ”
4066	4086	4059	4059	I	191	“ Jesus , it ’d be a wonder if you had a girlfriend . You ’ve got zero tact . ”
4095	4119	4087	4087	His	191	“ Maybe I ’ve got more than one . Tact is n’t exactly what the ladies are looking for these days , Wix . ”
4120	4129	4130	4130	I	191	“ Whatever . Get out of my room . ”
5125	5129	5130	5130	I	191	“ Stop it , ”
5135	5139	5130	5130	I	191	“ Just stop . ”
5140	5146	5147	5147	Logan	1099	“ Hurry up , Holly ! ”
5156	5169	5170	5170	I	191	“ Hold your horses , you breaking - and - entering fool , ”
5518	5620	5621	5621	I	191	“ When Chuck told me he planned to retire about three months later , I knew that I could n’t let him sell it to someone else . Coming back to that damn garage was the best homecoming I had . He was n’t surprised at all that I did n’t want him to sell it to anyone else , and was cool enough to help me buy it from him . I ’ve almost got him paid off , so the bank loan for the renovations was a leap of faith . It ’s turning out just fine , though . ”
5818	5829	5830	5830	Benny	76	“ Hot damn , look what the cat dragged in , ”
5863	5872	5844	5844	He	76	“ Hey , Ben . How ya been ? ”
5919	5937	5894	5894	He	76	“ I think I ’m more interested in how you ’ve been , Mrs. Billionaire Country Star . ”
5967	5978	5979	5979	He	76	“ I ’m fine . Just taking some time off . ”
6015	6026	6027	6027	Logan	1099	“ How about some shoes and a lane , Ben ? ”
6036	6053	6030	6032	The older man	277	“ Of course . Anything for my girl here . Except , there ’s a catch . ”
6054	6057	6058	6058	Logan	1099	“ Ben — ”
6079	6092	6030	6032	The older man	277	“ I ’ll sing one song . But not one of mine . ”
6093	6112	6113	6113	We	278	“ Done . Go bowl a few games , and I ’ll meet you in the bar later . ”
6618	6625	6626	6626	Logan	1099	“ Holly , what the hell ? ”
6629	6658	6626	6626	Logan	1099	“ I ca n’t do this . I need to stop thinking . I do n’t want to think any more tonight , and this is n’t working . ”
6717	6732	6733	6733	he	1099	“ What can I do ? How do we get you to stop thinking ? ”
6744	6750	6736	6736	I	191	“ Let ’s get drunk . ”
6756	6761	6751	6751	Logan	1099	“ I ’m driving . ”
6762	6769	6770	6770	He	1099	“ Then I ’ll get drunk . ”
6796	6800	6783	6783	he	1099	“ You sure ? ”
6801	6808	6809	6809	I	191	“ Abso - fucking - lutely . ”
6846	6872	6843	6843	he	293	“ Pick your poison then . And maybe get that song in for Ben before you ’re too lit to be able to sing it . ”
6873	6894	6895	6895	I	191	“ I think tonight is a tequila kind of night . And I can never be too lit to sing . ”
6900	6912	6895	6895	I	191	“ I do n’t think . I guess we ’ll see . ”
6913	6924	6931	6931	he	293	“ Fuck , I know this is a bad idea . ”
7127	7134	7124	7125	Miranda Lambert	75	“ Famous in a Small Town . ”
7239	7244	7236	7237	Sara Evans	82	“ Born to Fly . ”
7286	7292	7293	7293	someone	167	“ Another shot , Holly ? ”
7321	7332	7313	7313	I	191	“ I think you ’ve had enough , my dear . ”
7529	7535	7536	7536	someone	167	“ Another shot , Holly ? ”
7598	7609	7586	7586	I	191	“ I think you ’ve had enough , my dear . ”
7620	7627	7628	7628	she	1176	“ That ’s not your call , ”
7635	7644	7628	7628	she	1176	“ It is tonight . We ’re leaving . ”
7645	7658	7628	7628	she	1176	“ I ’m not going back to New York . Not now . ”
7666	7680	7659	7659	I	191	“ I think we should save that discussion for when you ’re sober . ”
7681	7690	7628	7628	she	1176	“ Fine . But I ’m not done . ”
7702	7708	7691	7691	She	1176	“ How about one more ? ”
7713	7724	7725	7725	Holly	1176	“ Let ’s take it back to some classic Reba ! ”
7728	7742	7725	7725	Holly	1176	“ I ’ve got a craving for a little something ‘ Fancy . ’ ”
7968	7974	8010	8010	she	1176	“ What are you — ? ”
7975	7982	8010	8010	she	1176	“ I ’m taking you home . ”
7983	7989	8010	8010	she	1176	“ I ’m not going — ”
7990	7997	8010	8010	she	1176	“ To your home , Holly . ”
7998	8001	8010	8010	she	1176	“ Oh . ”
8055	8062	8063	8063	I	191	“ She ’s done for tonight , ”
8067	8078	8063	8063	I	191	“ You can get her autograph another time , man . ”
8079	8098	8051	8053	A big guy	261	“ If I wanted her autograph , I would ’ve gotten it when I picked her up tonight . ”
8104	8111	8112	8112	Holly	1176	“ Logan , it ’s okay — ”
8222	8249	8205	8205	I	191	“ You ai n’t just coming in here and carrying her out without me hearing from Holly ’s lips that she wants to go with you . ”
8340	8368	8334	8334	I	191	“ Apparently I ’m at a disadvantage , because you know who I am , but I ’m pretty sure Holly has never mentioned anyone named Logan . ”
8427	8441	8442	8442	he	1099	“ I ai n’t tryin ’ to get between a husband and wife — ”
8445	8454	8455	8455	He	1099	“ Then turn around and head back inside . ”
8464	8483	8455	8455	He	1099	“ But I also do n’t believe in letting a woman I brought somewhere leave with another man . ”
8494	8521	8484	8484	I	191	“ Well , you sure as fuck are n’t leaving with her tonight . So you ’re going to have to put that belief on ice . ”
8540	8562	8484	8484	I	191	“ If you ’re looking to stake a claim on a woman , I suggest you pick one who ’s available . ”
8566	8585	8563	8563	He	1099	“ The only reason you had a shot at her is because I did n’t stake a claim . ”
8586	8630	8631	8631	I	191	“ Then you missed your shot . The next time we ’re in town , I ’ll buy you a beer to thank you . Right now , I ’d like to get my wife home before she pukes in my rental car . ”
8642	8666	8563	8563	He	1099	“ Seems to me a man with a wife like that should learn how to keep a hold on her a little better . ”
8691	8715	8717	8717	Boone	78	“ You better not keep doing shit that sends her running , or you ’re gon na fuckin ’ lose her for good , ”
8745	8778	8739	8739	he	78	“ That girl is one of the good ones . Do n’t make her cry , or I ’ll be forced to step in and take action . I consider her family . ”
8835	8842	8828	8828	Logan	1099	“ This conversation ai n’t done . ”
8852	8858	8843	8843	He	1099	“ But it can wait . ”
8878	8890	8891	8891	he	1099	“ You know how to get to her gran ’s place ? ”
9145	9153	9154	9154	Her	1176	“ I ’m confused . And drunk . ”
9161	9171	9154	9154	Her	1176	“ How the hell are you here ? Why ? ”
9172	9190	9154	9154	Her	1176	“ I think that conversation is best saved for when you ’ll actually remember what I say . ”
9191	9205	9206	9206	Her	1176	“ Good . I do n’t know what to say yet . . . ”
9225	9243	9218	9218	I	191	“ What the fuck did you do to her ? I ’ve never seen her like this . ”
9244	9253	9254	9254	His	1099	“ She was trying to forget about you . ”
9278	9293	9218	9218	I	191	“ Well , that is n’t fucking happening because I ’m not going anywhere . ”
9294	9332	9218	9218	I	191	“ Your choice , man , but if a woman asks me for space , I tend to give it to her if the alternative is pushing her away by refusing to give her what she needs . ”
9333	9349	9218	9218	I	191	“ What is it with rednecks and their fucking need to dispense backwoods wisdom today ? ”
9350	9367	9218	9218	I	191	“ I ’d resent that if you had n’t just acknowledged that they ’re wise words . ”
9497	9524	9532	9532	his	1099	“ You see that ring on her finger ? That means she ’s not fair game , unless that ’s the kind of guy you are . ”
9536	9569	9525	9525	Logan	1099	“ I ai n’t lookin ’ to poach . I respect that you took vows , but I also know that you do n’t have a good track record of keeping ’em . ”
9614	9634	9598	9600	an old man	350	“ All right now , boys . Time to get ’em out and measure , or get on home . ”
9635	9644	9645	9645	I	191	“ I think I ’ll take the latter , ”
9686	9696	9697	9699	the old man	350	“ You know where her gran ’s house is ? ”
9703	9706	9707	9707	Logan	1099	“ Mostly . ”
9721	9762	9716	9718	The old man	350	“ You just need to take a right , go a half mile , and it ’s the first house on the left after the power lines . If you hit the railroad tracks , you ’ve gone too far . ”
9778	9783	9771	9771	He	1099	“ This is hers . ”
9784	9788	9789	9789	I	191	“ Thank you , ”
9809	9827	9771	9771	He	1099	“ You take care of that girl , or I ’ll have your balls in a sling . ”
9863	9867	9860	9860	I	191	“ Duly noted . ”
9882	9901	9902	9902	His	1099	“ Her bedroom is the one at the top of the stairs . You ca n’t miss it . ”
9926	9939	9940	9940	My	191	“ I do n’t want to know why you fucking know that . ”
9969	9985	9956	9956	Logan	1099	“ Calm down , rich boy . It ai n’t like I popped her cherry . ”
10048	10062	10063	10063	I	191	“ You do know I can afford to make you disappear , right ? ”
10105	10133	10134	10134	he	362	“ Out here , a man does his own killin ’ and buryin ’ . I know miles of mine shaft where you ’d never be found , ”
10144	10164	10137	10137	I	191	“ I get that you ’re a cocky son of a bitch , but what ’s your angle here ? ”
10172	10195	10165	10165	He	362	“ I did n’t like the way Holly looked when she rolled into town , and you ’re the most likely cause . ”
10279	10292	10266	10266	I	191	“ I do n’t see how that ’s any of your business . ”
10309	10317	10293	10293	Logan	1099	“ I ’m making it my business . ”
10336	10367	10318	10318	I	191	“ I do n’t have time for this right now , but if you ’ve still got a death wish in the morning , you know where I ’ll be . ”
10389	10423	10368	10368	He	1099	“ Some of us have to work in the morning . Like me , on your wife ’s piece - of - shit car that broke down the second she pulled into town . ”
10430	10447	10424	10424	I	191	“ Do n’t bother fixing it . I ’ll buy her something when we get home . ”
10472	10481	10482	10482	Logan	1099	“ You sure she ’s leaving with you ? ”
10486	10493	10494	10494	I	191	“ Abso - fucking - lutely . ”
10503	10524	10525	10525	I	191	“ That ’s the same answer your wife gave when I asked her if she wanted to get drunk tonight . ”
10693	10699	10700	10700	I	191	“ Thank you , Logan , ”
10715	10721	10703	10703	I	191	“ It was n’t Logan . ”
10738	10741	10722	10722	I	191	“ Creighton ? ”
10804	10812	10775	10775	My	191	“ You do n’t remember last night ? ”
10893	10914	10857	10857	his	376	“ The fact that you expected another man to be in your bedroom pisses me the fuck off , Holly . ”
11200	11213	11216	11216	he	382	“ I , um , I ’m going to grab a shower . ”
11716	11721	11722	11722	I	191	“ What the hell ? ”
11729	11735	11722	11722	I	191	“ What does that mean ? ”
12009	12015	12002	12002	I	191	“ Lost on Fifth Avenue . ”
12379	12402	12371	12371	he	1099	“ Good to see that you ’re alive and kickin ’ this morning . Was a little worried about you last night . ”
12403	12420	12371	12371	he	1099	“ Maybe you should ’ve cut me off before I drowned myself in tequila and regret . ”
12431	12453	12421	12421	He	1099	“ You ’re a big girl . Figured you could make your own decision as to when you ’d had enough . ”
12454	12462	12371	12371	he	1099	“ Thanks for the vote of confidence . ”
12463	12501	12421	12421	He	1099	“ You made it this far . Did n’t think one drunk night back on your old stompin ’ grounds would derail you too much . Besides , the pictures of you online look pretty damn good . ”
12502	12505	12506	12506	My	191	“ Pictures ? ”
12514	12525	12506	12506	My	191	“ Shit . I did n’t even think . . . ”
12526	12549	12506	12506	My	191	“ Do n’t worry . The captions all say stuff about you having an impromptu concert in your hometown . Nothing scandalous . ”
12554	12567	12550	12550	My	191	“ Since when do you google me and read all that stuff ? ”
12588	12606	12584	12584	His	1099	“ Since before you showed up at my shop in that piece - of - shit Pontiac . ”
12623	12628	12629	12629	I	191	“ How long before ? ”
12640	12655	12656	12656	He	1099	“ On that one , I ’m gon na have to plead the Fifth . ”
12664	12681	12656	12656	He	1099	“ Was surprised to see the Caddy in the parking lot of Piggly Wiggly this morning . ”
12710	12755	12707	12707	Logan	1099	“ You do n’t remember the Caddy ? You damn near puked all over it . Barely got the door open in time . Karas ’s rental bill would ’ve been a little bit higher then , not that he would ’ve probably cared . ”
12771	12783	12831	12831	Logan	1099	“ Are you telling me that Creighton is at Piggly Wiggly ? ”
12834	12842	12831	12831	Logan	1099	“ That was my assumption , anyway . ”
13020	13027	13015	13015	He	406	“ Brantley . You need something ? ”
13028	13045	13046	13046	Creighton	48	“ Nothing at all . Just stopping in to see how Holly is feeling this morning . ”
13065	13082	13046	13046	Creighton	48	“ Might as well make yourself useful and carry in groceries before Holly tries to help . ”
13104	13115	13116	13116	Logan	1099	“ Damn , you planning to feed the whole neighborhood ? ”
13123	13133	13116	13116	Logan	1099	“ Or are you planning on staying a while ? ”
13134	13142	13143	13143	Creighton	48	“ Staying as long as Holly wants . ”
13204	13213	13214	13214	he	394	“ Shit , Holly . Are you okay ? ”
13411	13414	13415	13415	Crey	394	“ Holly ? ”
13428	13445	13481	13481	He	76	“ Yeah . I ’m fine . Sorry . Just . . . missed a step . ”
13460	13480	13455	13455	Creighton	48	“ I think we ’ve both missed several steps . And that ’s something we ’re going to rectify . ”
13539	13549	13531	13532	the men	279	“ You can just put them on the table . ”
13563	13596	13550	13550	Logan	1099	“ You need anything from me while you ’re in town , just holler . You still want me to fix up the car ? It ’ll sell better if it runs . ”
13597	13618	13550	13550	Logan	1099	“ You can tow it to the junkyard . Holly will have a new car waiting for her in Nashville . ”
13640	13660	13550	13550	Logan	1099	“ Whoa . No one is selling my car or towing it to a junkyard . I need it . ”
13687	13697	13698	13698	Logan	1099	“ You ca n’t drive that piece of shit , ”
13701	13705	13706	13706	I	191	“ Says who ? ”
13709	13713	13714	13714	Creighton	48	“ Says me , ”
13717	13722	13723	13723	My	191	“ Not your call . ”
13734	13751	13728	13728	Logan	1099	“ This sounds like a domestic issue . I ’ll let you two sort it out . ”
13761	13768	13752	13752	He	1099	“ Call me when you decide . ”
13808	13819	13837	13837	He	1099	“ Thanks , Brantley . We ’ll be in touch . ”
13854	13861	13837	13837	He	1099	“ See you around , Karas . ”
13925	13930	13905	13905	He	1099	“ You ’re staying ? ”
13956	13966	13931	13931	He	1099	“ We ’re going to get one thing straight . ”
13967	13970	13971	13971	I	191	“ Okay , ”
13974	13997	13931	13931	He	1099	“ This whole disappearing act bullshit ? It ’s not so much fun to be on the other end , is it ? ”
14018	14025	14008	14008	I	191	“ No . It ’s not . ”
14050	14077	14042	14042	he	1099	“ No , it ’s fucking not , Holly . And I ’m done with it . No more running . This is n’t a game . ”
14090	14097	14084	14084	I	191	“ Okay . No more running . ”
14105	14129	14098	14098	His	1099	“ You have a problem , you feel the need to run , you come to me and we ’ll figure it out . ”
14142	14163	14130	14130	I	191	“ Okay . I . . . I ’ll come to you . I wo n’t run . I swear . ”
14164	14168	14169	14169	His	1099	“ Good girl . ”
14181	14187	14188	14188	I	191	“ So you ’re staying ? ”
14200	14207	14214	14214	He	1099	“ Yes , I ’m staying . ”
14208	14213	14214	14214	He	1099	“ You ’re sure ? ”
14231	14239	14214	14214	He	1099	“ Yes . Because you ’re here . ”
14240	14246	14214	14214	He	1099	“ As simple as that ? ”
14247	14265	14214	14214	He	1099	“ Not everything has to be complicated , Holly . We do n’t have to be complicated . ”
14341	14347	14338	14338	I	191	“ You bought Lucky Charms ? ”
14348	14363	14338	14338	I	191	“ I thought you liked them . You mentioned them in your first single . ”
14403	14415	14338	14338	I	191	“ You actually listened to the lyrics of my first single ? ”
14419	14444	14416	14416	Creighton	48	“ Holly , I ’ve seen you perform live almost a dozen times . I know every word of every song at this point . ”
14445	14448	14471	14471	He	423	“ Oh . ”
14449	14454	14455	14455	He	423	“ Yeah . Oh . ”
14491	14502	14471	14471	He	423	“ Why does that surprise you ? It should n’t . ”
14503	14511	14471	14471	He	423	“ I just figured that . . . ”
14512	14515	14471	14471	He	423	“ What ? ”
14516	14538	14471	14471	He	423	“ That you watch me but do n’t really pay attention . You ’ve got more important things to think about . ”
14544	14563	14539	14539	He	423	“ You do n’t get it , Holly , and I ’m not going anywhere until you do . ”
14564	14568	14471	14471	He	423	“ Get what ? ”
14569	14582	14539	14539	He	423	“ That you ’re the most important thing in my life now . ”
14608	14621	14596	14596	He	423	“ See ? You do n’t believe me . But you will . ”
14673	14699	14711	14711	he	423	“ Well , maybe your body believes me . I guess I ’ll start there and work my way into convincing the rest of you . ”
15016	15041	15004	15004	I	191	“ How do you want to convince me ? Because right now , I ’d like you to convince me against the kitchen table . ”
15051	15061	15042	15042	Creighton	48	“ Jesus , woman . I fucking love you . ”
15078	15084	15085	15085	I	191	“ What did you say ? ”
15096	15104	15088	15088	His	394	“ I said I fucking love you . ”
15133	15139	15140	15140	I	191	“ Do you mean it ? ”
15166	15182	15156	15156	he	394	“ Of course I mean it . I rarely say anything I do n’t mean . ”
15214	15313	15209	15209	he	394	“ No . Do n’t say anything . When you tell me how you feel , I do n’t want there to be any hesitation , any question . I want the feeling to be burning through you so hot and fierce that you ca n’t hold it back , and you blurt it out at the most inopportune moment . That ’s what I want from you , Holly . Until I can have that , I ’ll settle for the rest of you . Because that ’s a pretty fucking fabulous deal on my part too . ”
15358	15367	15368	15368	His	429	“ You ’re so getting laid right now . ”
15376	15380	15368	15368	His	429	“ I know . ”
15416	15426	15381	15381	He	429	“ Really ? They do n’t all need to — ”
15427	15435	15436	15436	Crey	394	“ Do you really care right now ? ”
15444	15453	15439	15439	I	191	“ Nope . Not even a little bit . ”
15460	15463	15454	15454	He	429	“ Good . ”
15557	15568	15569	15569	I	191	“ Jesus Christ , Holly . You ’re fucking incredible . ”
15612	15629	15639	15639	Holly	1176	“ Woman , I ’m going to fuck you so hard we break this goddamn table . ”
15630	15634	15635	15635	I	191	“ Thank God , ”
15810	15827	15807	15807	I	191	“ It ’s been too fucking long since I ’ve had my mouth on your cunt . ”
15831	15843	15828	15828	Holly	1176	“ Yes . Yes , it has . I totally agree . ”
15890	15893	15854	15857	my sassy little wife	433	“ Hey ! ”
15894	15941	15951	15952	This woman	433	“ Unless you ’re moaning or saying ‘ more ’ or ‘ harder ’ or ‘ yes ’ or ‘ like that ’ or ‘ Creighton , you ’re a fucking pussy - eating god , ’ I do n’t want to hear it , Holly . ”
16075	16098	16108	16108	she	1176	“ Keep touching yourself . I want you coming again by the time I ’m splitting you wide open with my cock . ”
16199	16206	16180	16180	I	191	“ Hard and fast , yeah ? ”
16214	16225	16207	16207	She	1176	“ Then let ’s get to breaking this fucking table . ”
16263	16268	16248	16248	Her	1176	“ Jesus , woman . ”
16476	16483	16473	16473	I	191	“ No more running , Holly . ”
16495	16499	16484	16484	She	1176	“ I promise . ”
16717	16724	16696	16696	She	440	“ We ’re going to what ? ”
16725	16773	16774	16774	She	440	“ We ’re going to leave our cell phones downstairs , we ’re not answering the door , and unless the house is burning down around us , we ’re not leaving this room except to get food . And I might just feed you by hand . ”
16779	16789	16774	16774	She	440	“ Are you serious ? What about your empire ? ”
16790	16798	16774	16774	She	440	“ It ’ll keep running without me . ”
17143	17156	17173	17173	she	1176	“ Tell me about what it was like to grow up here . ”
17193	17217	17183	17183	I	191	“ Holly , I ’ve seen the town ; it ’s not a bad place . There ’s no reason to be ashamed . ”
17243	17246	17247	17247	She	1176	“ Holly ? ”
17256	17261	17247	17247	She	1176	“ What was that ? ”
17262	17275	17247	17247	She	1176	“ You have n’t seen where I really grew up , though . ”
17276	17283	17247	17247	She	1176	“ Is it far from here ? ”
17307	17316	17284	17284	She	1176	“ No . I want to hold you . ”
17387	17431	17549	17549	I	191	“ I told you about my mama . We bounced from trailer to trailer in Rusty Meadows , which is a couple miles from here , across the river . It ’s called Happy Meadows , but no one actually calls it that . ”
17432	17439	17549	17549	I	191	“ Was it an okay place ? ”
17445	17548	17440	17440	She	949	“ The people were generally pretty nice , with the exception of the times the guy she ’d shacked us up with would toss us out . Sometimes I ’d come home from school and find my clothes in the dirt because Mama did something to piss the guy off . Usually messing around with someone else and getting ready to jump ship . She called it lining up her next opportunity . Everyone else called it being a cheating whore . The thing that sucks worst about living in a small town is that everyone assumed I was just like her . ”
17572	17579	17549	17549	I	191	“ But you set them straight . ”
17580	17651	17549	17549	I	191	“ I just became an introvert . I did n’t talk to anyone . Did n’t date boys ; did n’t talk to boys . I did n’t want to be like my mama . Did n’t even have a boyfriend until I was a senior in high school . But she was gone for years by then . People started to forget about her , at least a little . ”
17652	17658	17549	17549	I	191	“ Where ’d she go ? ”
17659	17716	17549	17549	I	191	“ She hitched her wagon to a man who could afford to keep her in style . He bought her a Cadillac Eldorado and they took off . I did n’t see her again until Country Dreams happened , and now she just shows up when she needs money , which I do n’t really have . ”
17717	17741	17549	17549	I	191	“ Until you married me and I sent her off on a fully paid vacation , and made myself into an easy target . ”
17745	17760	17742	17742	Holly	1176	“ But you made her go away , and that ’s all I wanted . ”
17769	17784	17785	17785	I	191	“ Are you going to take me to Rusty Meadows while we ’re here ? ”
17809	17824	17803	17803	she	1176	“ No . It ’s not something I like to remember . This house , ”
17833	17846	17825	17825	she	1176	“ is the only home in this town I want to remember . ”
17847	17861	17803	17803	she	1176	“ Fair enough . And you were how old when you moved in ? ”
17862	17912	17913	17913	She	1176	“ Fourteen . Best thing that ever happened to me . Gran was friends with Ben and he gave me a job , which led to me singing karaoke and falling in love with being onstage , and the rest is history and would make a great country song . ”
17916	17947	17913	17913	She	1176	“ Speaking of which , I should totally write that one . I need a few more for the big - box exclusive tracks before I get back to Nashville . ”
18019	18032	18006	18006	I	191	“ When do you need to be back in Nashville this time ? ”
18033	18087	18088	18088	She	1176	“ I need to be in the studio two weeks from tomorrow to cut the tracks , and I need to hammer the last few songs out with Vale once I ’ve got ideas and practice them with the band . So probably . . . five or six days ? Maybe sooner ? ”
18094	18103	18088	18088	She	1176	“ Is that going to be a problem ? ”
18104	18124	18006	18006	I	191	“ No . We ’ll figure it out . You know there are recording studios in Manhattan , right ? ”
18129	18244	18125	18125	Her	1176	“ I . . . I just do n’t feel comfortable there . It ’s intimidating . Everyone ’s so focused and intense , and I feel like I ’m just wandering around , hoping to hell I do n’t get lost . I do n’t mind feeling small in the grand scheme of things , but something about New York just makes me feel . . . inadequate . I know it ’s your place , and I ’m not saying I wo n’t go back and try to learn to like it , but I do n’t think I ’m ever going to like it enough to want to live there permanently . ”
18323	18416	18315	18315	I	191	“ Next time , I ’ll show you a New Yorker ’s New York . The city has enough to offer that I think even you ’ll find something to enjoy . And I know it does n’t help to tell you that you belong there just as much as anyone else , but you do . Maybe more than anyone else , because you ’re mine . So if you ’re willing to give it another chance , I promise I ’ll give the entire city to you on a platter . ”
18417	18420	18421	18421	she	1176	“ Okay , ”
18431	18435	18424	18424	I	191	“ Thank you . ”
18515	18538	18512	18512	she	1176	“ Will you tell me about what it was like for you growing up ? Since we ’re doing the sharing thing ? ”
18601	18716	18588	18588	I	191	“ Up until the age of ten , my childhood was simple . My parents were dedicated to serving others . They were missionaries . When I was six , we moved to Papua New Guinea . We lived there for four years . I do n’t remember a lot before that , to be honest . Everything there was so vivid and alive . Simple . Amazing . I ran wild with the other missionaries ’ kids , and the mothers took turns homeschooling us . It was basically the best childhood a kid could ask for . My sister was born there , about a year before . . . everything changed . ”
18792	18937	18944	18944	Holly	1176	“ Sometimes I feel bad that Greer was too young to remember any of those good days , but then again , she also does n’t remember any of the bad . Including the day trip I took with another missionary family , because my best friend James and I were dead set on seeing the tree kangaroos . His dad promised us that he ’d find them for us , and he did . We came back late in the evening to the village , and found that fifteen people were slaughtered by a vigilante mob , including my parents , who tried to stop them . The mob was hunting down people accused of witchcraft . It seems insane in this day and age , like something out of the Salem witch trials , but it still happens there , even today . ”
18938	18943	18944	18944	Holly	1176	“ Oh my God , ”
18948	18966	18967	18967	She	1176	“ How did I not know about this ? The press — how do they not — ? ”
18981	19082	18967	18967	She	1176	“ My uncle paid a lot of money early on to cover it up . It was n’t hard . News does n’t travel very quickly or efficiently from Papua New Guinea . I certainly do n’t tell people , and my aunt and uncle did n’t want the notoriety . They were put out enough having to become responsible for two children they never wanted . They were the guardians my parents named in their will . I overheard James ’s father telling his mother that my uncle asked if the church could find someone else to take us . ”
19083	19088	18977	18977	she	1176	“ Oh my God . ”
19096	19109	19089	19089	My	191	“ It ’s always good to know that you ’re not wanted . ”
19148	19165	18967	18967	She	1176	“ Sweetheart , do n’t cry . It ’s not worth it . Not at all . ”
19166	19175	19128	19128	Holly	1176	“ But you were only ten . And — ”
19176	19252	18967	18967	She	1176	“ And you were only fourteen . If you think about it , we ’re not all that different . You got dropped off on your gran ’s front porch , and I got shipped off to boarding school . I ’m just happy as hell that you had a grandmother who loved you , and my aunt fell in love with my little sister . Greer became the daughter she never knew she wanted . ”
19278	19346	19253	19253	Holly	1176	“ I do n’t want you to cry for me . Neither of us can change our pasts , but somehow , all of these things happened in a way that made it possible for our paths to cross . No tears are necessary ; I ’ve got you in my arms , and I ’ve never been happier in my life than I am right now . ”
19357	19379	19347	19347	She	1176	“ Damn it , Crey . You ca n’t say things like that if you do n’t want me to cry . ”
19383	19386	19380	19380	I	191	“ Why ? ”
19387	19431	19347	19347	She	1176	“ Because it ’s not fair . And if you ’re trying to make sure I have no chance of holding on to any piece of my heart where you ’re concerned , you ’re doing a damn good job of that too . ”
19440	19524	19432	19432	My	191	“ Under any other circumstances , I ’d say I do n’t fight fair to get what I want . But when it comes to this , I want you to give it to me of your own free will . I ’m not taking it by strategy , power play , or seduction . I want it because you want me to have it . Freely given . Earned . And that will be the most valuable thing I ’ve ever received . ”
19540	19554	19534	19534	she	459	“ Shut up and kiss me before I drown you with happy tears . ”
19697	19716	19679	19679	Crey	394	“ I need to take more care with you . No sex today . You need to recover . ”
19717	19723	19679	19679	Crey	394	“ That ’s not fair ! ”
19730	19745	19724	19724	His	394	“ Does n’t mean I ca n’t fuck that sassy little mouth of yours . ”
20175	20191	20170	20170	His	17	“ Fuck . No , excuse me . Sorry . Was n’t talking to you , ”
20206	20210	20203	20203	he	17	“ Please continue , ”
20260	20267	20268	20268	he	17	“ We ’ll finish this later , ”
20333	20357	20328	20328	his	17	“ Best decision I ever made , Holly . Best decision I ever fucking made was making sure that missed connection went viral . ”
20376	20392	20328	20328	his	17	“ I ’m gon na come , sweetheart . You ready to swallow me down ? ”
20718	20722	20726	20726	Crey	394	“ Open it . ”
20743	20749	20723	20723	I	191	“ What ’s this for ? ”
20750	20756	20723	20723	I	191	“ It ’s for you . ”
20757	20761	20723	20723	I	191	“ But why ? ”
20762	20765	20723	20723	I	191	“ Because . ”
20855	20859	20860	20860	he	191	“ Open it , ”
20996	21010	20984	20984	I	191	“ Oh my God . It ’s . . . it ’s beautiful . ”
21020	21039	21011	21011	Creighton	48	“ There was a woman at the grocery store selling them in a little stall in the front . ”
21110	21116	21177	21177	Crey	394	“ You bought this yesterday ? ”
21117	21141	21177	21177	Crey	394	“ Yes . That ’s why it took me a little longer than I planned . I knew you had to have it . ”
21142	21176	21177	21177	Crey	394	“ Yesterday , when you still should ’ve been pissed that I left New York — again — and you ’d found me the night before hammered and out with another guy and — ”
21185	21219	21177	21177	Crey	394	“ Yesterday , when I was trying to figure out how to show my wife that she means everything to me so I do n’t fuck this up and lose her for good . ”
21250	21271	21272	21272	Crey	394	“ When did things change ? When did this go from being a whim to being . . . everything ? ”
21288	21362	21272	21272	Crey	394	“ I know I should have an answer for this that ’s epically romantic , but I do n’t think I can pinpoint the exact moment . I knew you were meant to be mine from that first night , but you ’re right — it was nothing but a gut feeling . I wanted you . Knew I had to have you . Was n’t going to stop until I found you . ”
21379	21477	21535	21535	His	485	“ Coming home to find you gone that first time made it clear to me that I had something to lose . Watching you onstage that first night in San Antonio made me realize that you were n’t only a unique woman , but an extremely talented one that I would always have to share with the world , because it would n’t be fair for me to keep you all to myself . I thought I would struggle with that , but instead , it ’s made me insanely proud to know that you ’re mine . ”
21484	21534	21478	21478	He	485	“ The second time I came home to find you gone , I knew my heart had walked out the door . I do n’t ever want to feel like that again , Holly , and I ’ll do whatever it takes to make sure it never happens again . ”
21572	21584	21569	21569	he	485	“ Are you sure you ’re going to be warm enough ? ”
21585	21605	21553	21553	he	485	“ If you ’d tell me what we ’re doing , it ’d be easier for me to decide . ”
21631	21644	21624	21624	My	191	“ Are you serious ? You really want to go to this ? ”
21645	21684	21695	21695	she	488	“ I have it on good authority from Delores Maynard that it ’s a good time . Not to be missed . Plus , she ’d like to see you again . She was hoping for an autograph . ”
21717	21724	21706	21706	I	191	“ Okay . Winterfest it is . ”
21732	21750	21706	21706	I	191	“ But I forgot something . I ’ll be right back , and we can head out . ”
21800	21815	21786	21786	I	191	“ I still ca n’t believe you ’d drive this far for fast food . ”
21837	21898	21899	21899	Her	1176	“ It ’s not like there was much else to do around here . We ’d pool our money for gas and get out of town when someone had their parents ’ car . You could only eat so much Mr. Burger . Besides , A&W is the best . You ca n’t get root beer like that just anywhere . ”
22260	22268	22269	22269	I	191	“ It seems we ’ve been spotted , ”
22272	22282	22283	22283	Holly	1176	“ Of course . You ’re hard to miss . ”
22289	22303	22269	22269	I	191	“ Me ? I ’m not the drop - dead sexy one here . ”
22309	22332	22304	22304	Her	1176	“ I would argue that point . Do you see the drool dripping from those Cover Girl lips pouting at the bar ? ”
22357	22368	22370	22370	she	1176	“ I do n’t see anyone but you , Holly . ”
22379	22384	22370	22370	she	1176	“ Care to dance ? ”
22393	22401	22387	22387	her	1176	“ You know how to line dance ? ”
22402	22409	22410	22410	I	191	“ Not even a little bit , ”
22413	22422	22410	22410	I	191	“ But I thought you could teach me . ”
22454	22468	22469	22469	she	1176	“ I ’d be happy to school you in something , Mr. Karas , ”
22482	22490	22472	22472	I	191	“ You already did . In love . ”
22503	22519	22491	22491	She	1176	“ That was cheesy as hell , and for the record , I loved it . ”
22539	22560	22491	22491	She	1176	“ Well , hell . I guess we ’ll have to wait to teach you the Boot Scootin ’ Boogie . ”
22561	22574	22529	22530	the band	1040	“ You really gon na get Karas out on the dance floor ? ”
22609	22616	22602	22602	I	191	“ Double fisting tonight , Brantley ? ”
22622	22655	22617	22617	He	1099	“ Nah . Was being polite and grabbed one for you , man . But if you do n’t want it , I know your wife likes a cold Bud just fine . ”
22661	22678	22656	22656	Holly	1176	“ Oh no , I ’m not drinking tonight . I may not ever drink again . ”
22679	22690	22656	22656	Holly	1176	“ An old pro like you ? Damn , Holly . ”
22691	22706	22707	22707	I	191	“ It ’s not like she ’s been able to drink for that long . ”
22714	22722	22707	22707	I	191	“ Unless you were a juvenile delinquent . ”
22727	22783	22784	22784	She	1176	“ There ’s not much else to do around here , I guess . Everyone looked the other way . Spent a lot of nights out in a field , chillin ’ on the tailgate of a truck backed up to a bonfire , stereo rockin ’ and a keg iced down in the bed . ”
22787	22810	22784	22784	She	1176	“ It sounds just like one of Boone ’s songs , probably because he writes from his experience just like I do . ”
22816	22861	22862	22862	Holly	1176	“ That ’s the best damn thing about country music . The heart and the truth . Writing about things that real people can relate to because we live it . We sing about our lives and our roots and the heart of us . ”
22867	22892	22862	22862	Holly	1176	“ Now I ’m sounding all melancholy like I ’ve been drinking . You better take that beer from Logan before I grab it . ”
22906	22912	22899	22899	Logan	1099	“ Cheers to the newlyweds . ”
22958	22984	22985	22985	Logan	1099	“ You better get in line for the food too , before that ’s all gone . You ’re almost too late as it is , ”
22988	23003	22949	22949	Holly	1176	“ No need , we ’ve already sampled the goodness of A&W this evening . ”
23012	23024	23004	23004	Logan	1099	“ You let her drag you an hour away for burgers ? ”
23025	23030	23031	23031	Holly	1176	“ And cheese fries , ”
23034	23041	23042	23042	Logan	1099	“ You ’re a good man , ”
23093	23100	23101	23101	Holly	1176	“ Probably better than I deserve , ”
23126	23131	23132	23132	he	1099	“ Now listen here — ”
23139	23159	23161	23162	the band	1040	“ Not nearly good enough for you , if you ask me . But I ’m working on it . ”
23181	23217	23161	23162	the band	1040	“ I ’ll leave you lovebirds to it . I got my eye on a likely lady for the night , and two - steppin ’ is a sure way to get her warmed up . ”
23236	23249	23227	23227	I	191	“ You want to teach me to two - step , sweetheart ? ”
23253	23258	23250	23250	She	1176	“ You want to ? ”
23259	23267	23250	23250	She	1176	“ I ’m up for anything tonight . ”
23275	23285	23268	23268	Her	1176	“ Good to know . Finish your beer first . ”
23471	23479	23480	23480	I	191	“ Are you happy you came home ? ”
23489	23552	23486	23486	she	1176	“ Yeah , I am . And I ’m happy you came too . I ’m glad I do n’t feel like I have to hide this part of myself anymore , that I do n’t have to be ashamed of where I came from . It ’s a weight I ’ve been carrying that I ’m glad to be rid of . ”
23553	23589	23664	23664	Her	1176	“ You never have to hide anything from me , Holly . I ’m in love with the woman you are , and anything that made you this way is something to be grateful for . ”
23594	23603	23590	23590	Her	1176	“ You still have n’t met my mama . ”
23604	23631	23486	23486	she	1176	“ We ’ll figure that out . There ’s got to be a way to smooth it over and make that part of your life easier . ”
23635	23650	23632	23632	She	1176	“ I do n’t want to think about that tonight . Not at all . ”
23651	23663	23590	23590	Her	1176	“ That ’s fine . What would you rather think about ? ”
23685	23702	23664	23664	Her	1176	“ Maybe the fact that I ’ve got a surprise for you when we get home . ”
23720	23725	23703	23703	She	1176	“ Is that so ? ”
23726	23738	23703	23703	She	1176	“ Yep . One I think you ’re going to like . ”
23778	23794	23769	23769	I	191	“ You know I ’m not lifting my ban on certain activities today . . . ”
23849	23877	23838	23838	she	1176	“ The giant butt plug in my ass says you do n’t need to lift your ban because you ’re going to be conquering new territory tonight . ”
23909	23927	23897	23902	the couples on the dance floor	518	“ Nothing to see here , folks . Just a man crazy in love with his bride . ”
23945	23951	23952	23952	I	191	“ You ’re a menace , ”
23977	24015	24016	24016	Her	1176	“ You announce to the whole damn town that you ’re crazy in love with your new bride , and you do n’t think you deserve road head for that ? You ’re something else , Crey . ”
24028	24033	24037	24037	she	1176	“ Jesus , woman . ”
24073	24089	24069	24069	She	1176	“ Just get us there in one piece , Crey . That ’s your job . ”
24277	24291	24334	24334	she	1176	“ I ’m gon na come , baby . You ready for that ? ”
24372	24377	24397	24397	She	1176	“ Holly — fuuuck . ”
24431	24443	24417	24417	she	1176	“ You ’re amazing . And you ’re all fucking mine . ”
24493	24505	24479	24479	She	1176	“ Jesus , Crey . Did you even zip your jeans ? ”
24531	24539	24523	24523	I	191	“ No . Do n’t fucking care . ”
24574	24578	24579	24579	I	191	“ Good woman , ”
24583	24608	24609	24609	She	1176	“ You ’re just feeling good because you got a blow job in the car , and now you ’re going to brown town . ”
24641	24650	24631	24631	I	191	“ God , you ’re good for me . ”
24651	24659	24660	24660	She	1176	“ And do n’t you forget it . ”
24677	24680	24660	24660	She	1176	“ Impossible . ”
24783	24786	24787	24787	I	191	“ Eager ? ”
24799	24823	24787	24787	I	191	“ When it comes to you , I ’m always eager , Holly . That ’s something that ’s never going to change . ”
24896	24910	24911	24911	He	394	“ You could ’ve taken the time to zip up , you know . ”
24932	24983	24911	24911	He	394	“ Holly , when you told me that you had a butt plug up that sweet little ass of yours , I stopped caring about making sure my pants were zipped , because my dick knows exactly where it wants to be — and it ’s not in my pants . ”
24984	24996	24998	24998	his	394	“ Oh my God , did you really just say that ? ”
25008	25029	24911	24911	He	394	“ It ’s the truth . And you ’re the one taunting me with the promise of that gorgeous ass . ”
25037	25044	25030	25030	I	191	“ Still , you ’re crazy . ”
25056	25067	25045	25045	He	394	“ You make me crazy , woman . About you . ”
25076	25082	25073	25073	I	191	“ Is this for real ? ”
25115	25148	25111	25111	he	394	“ As real as it fucking gets , Holly . That ’s what I ’m trying to show you . This . Us . It ’s as real as it fucking gets . ”
25305	25312	25287	25287	They	533	“ I love you , Crey . ”
25323	25338	25313	25313	His	394	“ I feel like I ’ve been waiting forever for you to say that . ”
25339	25395	25313	25313	His	394	“ And I feel like I ’ve been waiting forever for you , period . I should say there are so many things I ’d do differently in my life , but I really would n’t change a thing and run the risk of not ending up right here , right now , with you . ”
25396	25410	25440	25440	he	535	“ You ’ve changed everything for me , Holly . Every fucking thing . ”
25451	25454	25449	25449	we	536	“ I do ”
25531	25536	25537	25537	I	191	“ I want you , ”
25540	25545	25537	25537	I	191	“ Are you sure ? ”
25546	25549	25550	25550	Crey	394	“ Yes . ”
25562	25588	25550	25550	Crey	394	“ Your heart and your virgin ass in one night . Jesus , Holly , I really am the luckiest fucking bastard on the planet . ”
25596	25612	25589	25589	I	191	“ Seriously . Some of your lines tonight — not even a little bit smooth . ”
25613	25627	25628	25628	he	394	“ I do n’t need to try to be smooth with you anymore , ”
25635	25642	25628	25628	he	394	“ I can just be me . ”
25691	25703	25673	25674	The player	537	“ Let ’s get you out of those clothes , sweetheart . ”
25746	25761	25762	25762	Crey	394	“ I see you took me seriously when I told you to dress warm , ”
25769	25783	25762	25762	Crey	394	“ I ’m starting to take everything you say seriously , I guess . ”
25784	25787	25824	25824	He	394	“ Good . ”
25819	25823	25824	25824	He	394	“ Let me . ”
25874	25879	25871	25871	Crey	394	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
25921	25928	25914	25914	Holly	1176	“ Holly , what the hell ? ”
25929	25945	25914	25914	Holly	1176	“ How pissed are you going to be if I call a time - out ? ”
25952	25958	25946	25946	Crey	394	“ A time - out ? ”
25967	25973	25946	25946	Crey	394	“ What does that mean ? ”
25982	25995	25974	25974	I	191	“ I need to write something down quick before I forget it . ”
26021	26036	26037	26037	He	394	“ This is what I get for falling in love with a creative genius . ”
26136	26161	26122	26122	Crey	394	“ Sweetheart , she ’s making you another half dozen of them , so do n’t worry about it . Just write your lyrics . ”
26336	26344	26345	26345	I	191	“ Wha — what are you doing ? ”
26380	26394	26395	26395	he	394	“ That was one of the hottest fucking things I ’ve ever seen , ”
26398	26403	26395	26395	he	394	“ Are you serious ? ”
26404	26485	26493	26493	his	394	“ Dead serious . And if you do n’t want me in your ass in the next five minutes , I ’m going to be jacking myself off all over those lush tits of yours . Which , by the way , bounce a whole fuck of a lot while you ’re humming to yourself and scribbling away . If I had n’t just come down your throat , I might ’ve accidentally shot my load all over your bed . ”
26505	26537	26493	26493	his	394	“ I ca n’t help that you ’re so fucking sexy , Holly . That ’s on you , my beautiful wife . So , what ’s it going to be ? ”
26606	26613	26601	26601	I	191	“ I think I ’m ready . ”
26621	26633	26614	26614	Crey	394	“ Good girl . Now come here . I want you . ”
26647	26654	26634	26634	I	191	“ How do you want me ? ”
26655	26659	26660	26660	His	394	“ So perfect . ”
26693	26745	26682	26682	He	394	“ I had some kind of crazy luck guiding me on Christmas Eve . . . I ca n’t imagine having missed you that night . It would ’ve been the biggest loss of my life , and I never would ’ve had any idea what I ’d missed out on . ”
26779	26802	26746	26746	He	394	“ I ’ll never understand how it worked out the way it did , but I ’m not about to question fate . ”
26821	26845	26746	26746	He	394	“ I never believed in fate until I met you . Now there ’s no way I ’d believe this was anything but . ”
26870	26895	26896	26896	He	394	“ Are you sure you want this ? Because if you ’re not ready , I ’m not going to push this on you . ”
26939	26955	26937	26937	them	541	“ I ’m ready . I want you . I want this to be yours . ”
26956	26974	26981	26981	He	394	“ If it ever gets to be too much , all you have to say is stop . ”
26975	26980	26937	26937	them	541	“ I trust you . ”
26984	27002	26981	26981	He	394	“ Now , where ’s the lube you secreted away in your bag with that sexy plug ? ”
27003	27007	26981	26981	He	394	“ Bathroom counter . ”
27051	27059	27060	27060	I	191	“ I guess you really are eager , ”
27063	27081	27060	27060	I	191	“ When I ’m about to sink into that perfect ass of yours ? Even more so . ”
27091	27103	27060	27060	I	191	“ Then you better get over here and get to it . ”
27197	27200	27191	27191	he	394	“ Holly ? ”
27213	27226	27201	27201	I	191	“ What if I hate it ? What if it ’s horrible ? ”
27247	27262	27227	27227	His	394	“ Then I ’ll give you all the orgasms you can handle another way . ”
27263	27278	27227	27227	His	394	“ Are you sure ? You wo n’t care if I change my mind ? ”
27286	27346	27375	27375	Crey	394	“ Holly , all that matters is that I ’m here with you , and you ’re enjoying what we ’re doing . If you want me to drop this lube , pull that plug out of your ass , and go find a game of Scrabble , I ’ll still be the happiest guy in this whole town . ”
27361	27374	27356	27356	I	191	“ Let ’s leave the Scrabble for later . I ’m ready . ”
27563	27591	27592	27592	He	394	“ Goddamn , this is going to be amazing . I ’ve thought about what it ’d be like to have you beneath me just like this . ”
27642	27647	27657	27657	my	191	“ Ready , sweetheart ? ”
27648	27651	27657	27657	my	191	“ Yes . ”
27718	27729	27730	27730	He	394	“ Jesus , Holly . You ’re so fucking tight . ”
27807	27812	27813	27813	I	191	“ Oh my God , ”
27942	27947	27948	27948	I	191	“ Holy . Shit , ”
28016	28020	28021	28021	Crey	394	“ Oh sh — ”
28047	28071	28098	28098	He	394	“ Holy crap . And you did n’t even plan to screw me so hard we ’d break my poor Jenny Lind bed . ”
28072	28076	28077	28077	Crey	394	“ Jenny who ? ”
28148	28181	28195	28195	I	191	“ Jenny Lind . It was an antique . It was Gran ’s bed when she was a girl . It was one of the few pieces I probably would have kept . ”
28182	28194	28120	28120	He	394	“ We ’ll get it repaired . It ’s no problem . ”
28209	28235	28236	28236	Crey	394	“ We ’re just breaking furniture right and left . Going to have to make sure whatever we buy for our new place is sturdy , ”
28245	28250	28239	28239	I	191	“ Our new place ? ”
28251	28346	28347	28347	Warmth	112	“ I think we need to buy a place in Nashville so we can have a home base there . We ’ll keep my place in New York , and figure out something that works for both of us . As much as you do n’t like the city , I do need to spend some time there . There are certain things I can do remotely , but I ’m a hell of a lot more intimidating in person , and sometimes I need to throw my weight around to get shit done . ”
28368	28378	28347	28347	Warmth	112	“ Thank you for trying to figure this out . ”
28387	28401	28379	28379	He	112	“ I ’d figure out how to move mountains for you , Holly . ”
28412	28421	28402	28402	I	191	“ I think I ’m finally getting that . ”
28451	28462	28402	28402	I	191	“ Now , how do you feel about Dirty Scrabble ? ”
28489	28507	28508	28508	Holly	1176	“ C - U - N - T. Cunt . Triple - word score . Eighteen points . ”
28525	28544	28508	28508	Holly	1176	“ I ’m going to catch you . Fellatio as a double word was only four points more . ”
28545	28550	28551	28551	I	191	“ Sorry , sweetheart . ”
28569	28585	28586	28586	I	191	“ S - U - C - K - E - D. Another triple word . ”
28590	28596	28586	28586	I	191	“ Thirty - nine points . ”
28597	28601	28611	28611	she	1176	“ Damn it . ”
28646	28662	28639	28639	She	1176	“ Why is it that every other freaking word you have is about dick sucking ? ”
28679	28768	28663	28663	I	191	“ Because I ’m a guy . That ’s what I think about . Not too hard to figure out here . Let ’s not sugarcoat it — if I ’m looking at your mouth , there ’s a decent chance I ’m thinking about putting my dick in it . If I ’m looking at your tits , there ’s a good chance I ’m thinking about sucking on them or fucking them . Same with your pussy and your ass . Men are not that complicated . ”
28776	28791	28769	28769	Her	548	“ I beg to differ . You ’re all sorts of complicated , Karas . ”
28792	28803	28663	28663	I	191	“ I just like you to think that , Holly . ”
28884	28899	28900	28900	She	53	“ D - I - L - D - O. Dildo . Seven points . ”
28904	28922	28900	28900	She	53	“ You know , I ’ve never actually owned a dildo . Or a vibrator . Whatever . ”
28923	28926	28930	28930	my	191	“ Seriously ? ”
28937	28955	28900	28900	She	53	“ Well , no . I mean , yes , seriously . I ’ve never owned one . ”
28956	28962	28930	28930	my	191	“ How is that possible ? ”
28963	28989	28900	28900	She	53	“ I just never went out and got one . I do n’t know . I figured my hand got the job done just fine . ”
28999	29013	28990	28990	I	191	“ I swear , everything that comes out of your mouth surprises me . ”
29057	29067	28990	28990	I	191	“ M - I - N - E. Mine . ”
29074	29092	29068	29068	Holly	1176	“ It ’s Dirty Scrabble , Crey . Not whatever - word - you - want Scrabble . ”
29093	29117	29068	29068	Holly	1176	“ True , but that ’s what you are , dirty or not , so that ’s my last word on the subject . ”
29149	29160	29146	29146	I	191	“ I ’ll make my dirty contribution this way instead . ”
29298	29337	29338	29338	Crey	394	“ I do n’t think you understand , Cannon , this is more important . Holly is more important . I know that you’re — I know . I know . But you ’re not listening to me . ”
29348	29356	29338	29338	Crey	394	“ I ’ll call you back later . ”
29378	29404	29405	29405	His	394	“ Hey , you ’re up . How ’d you sleep on our floor mattress ? I still ca n’t believe we broke the bed . ”
29413	29418	29405	29405	His	394	“ And the table . ”
29419	29426	29452	29452	He	394	“ Crey , what ’s wrong ? ”
29470	29510	29452	29452	He	394	“ You know how I said sometimes I ’m needed to show up and be intimidating in person and throw my weight around ? Now is one of those times . I need to be back in New York . ”
29568	29583	29584	29584	I	191	“ Then you should get back to New York and throw your weight around , ”
29604	29634	29588	29588	His	394	“ I told you I ’d stay until you understood that nothing is more important than you , and if I leave , then I ’m not doing that . ”
29657	29691	29644	29644	I	191	“ You ’ve already shown me that . I believe you . Now go back to New York and take care of business like the ruthless guy I know you want to unleash . ”
29703	29708	29700	29700	his	394	“ You ’re sure ? ”
29709	29770	29809	29809	He	394	“ Yes . You told me this is as real as it gets , and real means that we each handle our own shit with the support of the other beside or behind us , whatever the case may be . If I can be with you , I will , and vice versa . We ’ll figure it out . ”
29782	29789	29771	29771	Crey	394	“ I love you , Holly . ”
29790	29808	29771	29771	Crey	394	“ Then go conquer the world . I ’ll be waiting for you when you get done . ”
29841	29848	29849	29849	he	394	“ I thought I had everything , ”
29856	29867	29849	29849	he	394	“ And then I met you . Now I do . ”
29885	29903	29868	29868	I	191	“ You ca n’t say things like that . I ’m seriously not equipped to handle it . ”
29904	29934	29849	29849	he	394	“ I did n’t know I was equipped to say things like that until you either . Guess we ’re both going to have to find our footing here . ”
29942	29978	29937	29937	I	191	“ Get your stuff packed , and I ’ll drive you to the airport . I guess I should ask if you mind if I keep the rental car and take it back to Nashville . ”
29986	30039	29979	29979	He	394	“ Of course I do n’t mind . As long as you do n’t mind that you ’re getting a new car whether you want one or not . And I ’m picking it out , since apparently your last two were Pontiacs , and Detroit does n’t even make those anymore . ”
30040	30066	30087	30087	I	191	“ Whatever . Just know that I ’m still gon na drive like a girl from Gold Haven , so you better get good insurance . ”
30074	30086	30071	30071	he	394	“ On second thought , I ’m buying you a tank . ”
30210	30217	30218	30218	he	394	“ When are you heading back ? ”
30240	30255	30231	30231	I	191	“ Probably not for another day or two . I ’ve got some time . ”
30263	30322	30256	30256	I	191	“ This has actually been exactly what I needed . I ’m going to stay , fine - tune the songs as much as I can before I head back . I might even try to pack some stuff in my room and make a trip to Goodwill . I need to make a decision about the house . ”
30323	30332	30256	30256	I	191	“ What decision do you want to make ? ”
30333	30348	30256	30256	I	191	“ I should sell it . I have no earthly reason to keep it . ”
30349	30352	30256	30256	I	191	“ But ? ”
30353	30363	30256	30256	I	191	“ But I ’m just not quite ready yet . ”
30364	30367	30368	30368	Crey	394	“ Holly . ”
30376	30391	30368	30368	Crey	394	“ You do n’t ever have to sell if you do n’t want to . ”
30392	30410	30256	30256	I	191	“ It seems silly to keep paying the property taxes and utilities when no one lives here . ”
30411	30414	30415	30415	he	394	“ Baby , ”
30422	30428	30415	30415	he	394	“ We can afford it . ”
30429	30466	30256	30256	I	191	“ Okay , I wo n’t sell it for now . It ’s nice to have somewhere to come home to . Besides , I ’m finding that I like keeping a tie to my roots . ”
30467	30474	30475	30475	His	394	“ Good . I ’m glad . ”
30491	30498	30475	30475	His	394	“ I need to take this . ”
30499	30518	30519	30519	I	191	“ Go conquer the world from New York , Crey . We ’re going to be just fine . ”
30719	30728	30729	30729	I	191	“ What the hell are you doing here ? ”
30753	30760	30733	30733	He	561	“ Special delivery from your man . ”
30761	30766	30767	30767	I	191	“ What the hell ? ”
30810	30843	30787	30787	my	191	“ Okay , well . Now that that ’s done , I got ta run , sugar . I ’ll see you at the lanes tonight , if you ’re coming in . ”
31070	31079	31080	31080	I	191	“ I ’m coming , I ’m coming , ”
31110	31119	31080	31080	I	191	“ Hey , baby ! Mama ’s home ! ”
31742	31745	31746	31746	Relief	116	“ Crey ? ”
31757	31762	31746	31746	Relief	116	“ Hey , baby . ”
31763	31784	31746	31746	Relief	116	“ Hi . Can I call you back ? I ’m sort of . . . busy at the moment . ”
31818	31825	31793	31793	she	1176	“ Holly ? Is everything okay ? ”
31826	31845	31846	31846	Her	1176	“ It ’s fine . Everything ’s fine . Can I call you back in a couple hours ? ”
31864	31873	31874	31874	I	191	“ Something ’s wrong . What is it ? ”
31877	31892	31930	31930	She	1176	“ I ca n’t really talk now , but I ’ll tell you later . ”
31911	31922	31893	31893	I	191	“ Call me anytime . I love you , Holly . ”
31923	31929	31942	31942	she	1176	“ ’ Bye , Crey . ”
32028	32037	32025	32025	I	191	“ Bushmills 21 , please . Three fingers . ”
32038	32043	32044	32044	He	590	“ Yes , sir . ”
32588	32613	32614	32614	I	191	“ I came here to find a hot guy who looked like he could handle himself , and see where the night takes us . ”
32682	32697	32698	32698	I	191	“ Do n’t they keep you chained to your desk until midnight every night ? ”
32727	32777	32721	32721	She	1074	“ I know , right ? Hell , Crey , I have n’t gotten out this early in months . And it ’s all because I ca n’t work on the project you ’ve got everyone else locked down on . Sometimes conflicts of interest are a wonderful thing . ”
32802	32812	32836	32836	She	1074	“ You do n’t need that job , Gree . ”
32857	32906	32836	32836	She	1074	“ I ’m not living off your money . Besides , it ’s not like I ’m going to be at the sweatshop forever . A few years will be enough to get me a job in - house , and then I ’ll be living the dream . ”
32924	32936	32907	32907	I	191	“ You realize the grass is n’t always greener , right ? ”
32937	32964	32988	32989	A server	604	“ Do n’t burst my bubble just yet . I spent three years busting my ass for this degree ; I ’m going to use it . ”
33001	33010	33011	33011	I	191	“ When did you switch to hard liquor ? ”
33022	33032	33011	33011	I	191	“ You used to drink wine , not gin . ”
33039	33076	33014	33018	the big brother in me	605	“ Calm down , Crey . I ’m splurging on the good stuff because you ’re buying . Besides , Tristan is trying to get me to drink more ‘ sophisticated ’ drinks than just wine . ”
33086	33094	33077	33077	I	191	“ Tristan ’s a dick , Greer . ”
33100	33115	33095	33095	She	606	“ He ’s not a dick . He ’s a good guy , really . ”
33134	33152	33095	33095	She	606	“ Really ? Then why are n’t you with Tristan right now rather than your big brother ? ”
33162	33198	33153	33153	Her	606	“ Because he does n’t like me coming over late . Says it messes with his sleep schedule . But we ’re going away together next weekend . We need some time alone to reconnect . ”
33278	33292	33272	33272	Greer	101	“ So , when am I going to get to meet your wife ? ”
33314	33339	33308	33308	Holly	1176	“ Soon . You should come to one of her shows . She ’s fucking amazing , Gree . You ’ll be absolutely stunned . ”
33340	33373	33293	33293	I	191	“ Um , news flash , Crey . I ’ve seen her perform on TV ; I know what she sounds like . And you ’re right — she is fucking amazing . ”
33374	33383	33308	33308	Holly	1176	“ When did you see her on TV ? ”
33384	33446	33293	33293	I	191	“ I watched the back episodes of Country Dreams as soon as your news hit the papers . I wanted to see this girl who ’s now my sister . You did good . She ’s crazy talented . They polished her up a lot from that first audition , but her voice has carried through . The judges were stunned . ”
33456	33462	33463	33463	Greer	101	“ What are you doing ? ”
33466	33479	33537	33537	Holly	1176	“ I ’m getting a copy of that season of the show . ”
33480	33499	33293	33293	I	191	“ You have n’t already ? Seriously ? I thought that would ’ve been in the background check . ”
33500	33516	33537	33537	Holly	1176	“ If it was , then Cannon did n’t share it with me . Shit . ”
33548	33556	33557	33557	Cannon	327	“ Not a good time , Crey , ”
33564	33583	33537	33537	Holly	1176	“ Jesus , Cannon . If you ’re fucking someone , do n’t answer the goddamn phone then . ”
33584	33623	33537	33537	Holly	1176	“ We ’re in DEFCON 5 right now , so I figured it had to be important . If it ’s not , I ’ll get back to Rachel , and we can discuss this in the morning . ”
33624	33663	33537	33537	Holly	1176	“ Guess I ’m impressed you actually know her name . And yeah , it ’s important , but you can finish up with Rachel first . I want the season of Country Dreams that Holly starred on . ”
33664	33671	33537	33537	Holly	1176	“ You interrupted me for that ? ”
33672	33677	33678	33678	I	191	“ It ’s important , ”
33688	33729	33678	33678	I	191	“ And you already have it in your e - mail . Go look for my e - mail from New Year ’s Day , after you told me her name . I compiled the report and sent you everything . ”
33730	33737	33738	33738	I	191	“ Thanks . Enjoy your night , ”
33749	33753	33745	33745	Greer	101	“ Told you . ”
33754	33764	33771	33771	I	191	“ Did you listen to the whole damn conversation ? ”
33765	33770	33745	33745	Greer	101	“ Hard not to . ”
33776	33791	33771	33771	I	191	“ I need to get home . I ’ve got some TV to watch . ”
33804	33815	33771	33771	I	191	“ Fine , leave your little sister to drink alone . ”
33849	33875	33771	33771	I	191	“ You ’re not drinking tonight . You ’re going home and getting a decent night ’s sleep before you go back to the office . ”
33876	33934	33824	33824	I	191	“ I do n’t think so , Crey . I ’m going to sit down , relax , and enjoy my drink . You run along and watch your wife before she was your wife . I ’ll see you in the morning . I ’ll be the one running around with partners snapping orders at me . ”
33935	33950	33990	33990	I	191	“ At least tell me you ’re taking a cab home and not walking . ”
33951	33962	33824	33824	I	191	“ It ’s like six blocks . Cab not required . ”
33968	33981	33963	33963	I	191	“ I guess I ’m waiting until you finish your drink then . ”
34418	34448	34415	34415	she	439	“ You could ’ve talked to him , you know . You must miss him like crazy , being that he ’s not here and you ’re newlyweds still . ”
34449	34460	34415	34415	she	439	“ Uh , I ’ll catch up with him later . ”
34461	34467	34468	34468	She	439	“ If you ’re sure . ”
34474	34508	34468	34468	She	439	“ How about I make us some sweet tea and we can sit and talk a spell ? I ’m planning to head over to B&B tonight to catch up with some friends . ”
34517	34520	34515	34515	Mama	1013	“ Okay . ”
34672	34685	34666	34666	she	439	“ You look happy , Holly . Is he making you happy ? ”
34686	34691	34666	34666	she	439	“ Wha — what ? ”
34692	34701	34666	34666	she	439	“ Happy . Is he making you happy ? ”
34753	34795	34747	34747	I	191	“ I am . We had a bit of a rough start , but I think we ’ve finally got our feet under us . Me walking out and coming here was probably the best thing I could ’ve possibly done . ”
34828	34844	34809	34809	Mama	1013	“ You walked out on that man ? Please tell me that is n’t true . ”
34863	34930	34809	34809	Mama	1013	“ What would you have done if your husband ’s first wife cornered you at a benefit , telling you you were lucky number three and not the second wife like you ’d thought , and sent you into a panic attack , making you realize you had to get out of that concrete jungle of a claustrophobic nightmare before you lost your friggin ’ mind ? ”
34943	35010	34934	34934	Mama	1013	“ He ’s been married three times ? But the news never says that . Ever . And he did n’t tell you ? Oh my , Holly . I do n’t like that he ’s keeping secrets . That ’s not the way a marriage is supposed to work . Trust me , as bad as I ’ve been at them , I should know . ”
35035	35053	34934	34934	Mama	1013	“ Wait , what ? How many times have you been married ? I thought . . . ”
35113	35145	35099	35099	she	1013	“ Well , let ’s just say you ’re not the only one in the family to have a quickie Vegas wedding . Let ’s just hope you only have one . ”
35160	35179	35099	35099	she	1013	“ You did n’t think it was necessary to mention ? I mean , seriously ? How many ? ”
35197	35203	35180	35180	She	1013	“ Mama , how many ? ”
35204	35218	35180	35180	She	1013	“ Two in Vegas , one in Reno , and one in Paducah . ”
35219	35235	35180	35180	She	1013	“ You ’ve been married four freaking times and never once told your only daughter ? ”
35293	35356	35286	35286	she	1013	“ I know I ’ve been a horrible mother , and I have no excuses . But your gran raised you better than I ever could have . I ’m sorry for everything , Holly . I ’ve made a mess of my life and yours and hers , and I ’m trying to make amends . I ’m just learning how . ”
35436	35484	35429	35429	I	191	“ I did n’t tell you about the weddings because I knew they were n’t going to last . Nothing ever did . You already hated me , and I did n’t want to give you any more reason to show you what a failure I was . ”
35502	35513	35490	35490	my	191	“ Oh , Mama . I do n’t hate you . ”
35514	35557	35429	35429	I	191	“ Yes , you do . You should . I killed my own mama . I ’m a horrible person . I deserve to go straight to hell for what I ’ve done , and instead your husband sends me on vacation . ”
36178	36182	36172	36172	Holly	1176	“ Independence Day , ”
36231	36234	36235	36235	She	1176	“ Holly . ”
36247	36250	36235	36235	She	1176	“ Hey . ”
36251	36256	36235	36235	She	1176	“ Are you okay ? ”
36257	36299	36235	36235	She	1176	“ Oh , I ’m about to be a hell of a lot better than just okay . But your note said you wanted to hear me scream your name , Mr. Executive , so here I am , following orders . ”
36355	36375	36352	36352	her	1176	“ Are you telling me that right now , you ’ve got that vibrator buried in your sweet pussy ? ”
36376	36384	36352	36352	her	1176	“ And a plug up my ass . ”
36385	36392	36393	36393	I	191	“ Jesus fucking Christ , Holly , ”
36399	36408	36393	36393	I	191	“ You have n’t made yourself come yet ? ”
36409	36419	36352	36352	her	1176	“ No . I wanted you to hear me . ”
36420	36424	36393	36393	I	191	“ Good girl . ”
36464	36469	36352	36352	her	1176	“ Are you — ? ”
36470	36513	36530	36530	Her	635	“ I ’m getting my cock out so I can jack myself off to the sound of you coming . I miss you , Holly . Miss your hot little cunt , your tight little ass , and those perfect fucking tits . ”
36514	36529	36530	36530	Her	635	“ Holy crap . I think I almost came just hearing you say that . ”
36540	36543	36537	36537	I	191	“ Good . ”
36602	36617	36645	36645	I	191	“ Because you liked having my cock in your ass , did n’t you ? ”
36618	36635	36678	36678	Her	1176	“ I ’m pretty sure I came until I almost blacked out , did n’t I ? ”
36636	36644	36645	36645	I	191	“ You ’re fucking perfect , woman , ”
36661	36677	36645	36645	I	191	“ Now we ’re going to see how good you are at getting yourself off . ”
36686	36712	36678	36678	Her	1176	“ I already know I ’m good at that , Crey . Trust me . Lots of practice in the one - handed action department . ”
36726	36740	36713	36713	I	191	“ Okay , baby . You said you already have it inside you ? ”
36741	36744	36678	36678	Her	1176	“ Yeah . ”
36745	36754	36713	36713	I	191	“ How close are you to the edge ? ”
36755	36760	36678	36678	Her	1176	“ Pretty freaking close . ”
36761	36775	36713	36713	I	191	“ I want you to slow down , tease yourself for a minute . ”
36776	36786	36678	36678	Her	1176	“ What do you think I ’ve been doing ? ”
36787	36797	36713	36713	I	191	“ Are you getting bossy with me , Holly ? ”
36798	36807	36808	36808	Her	638	“ Maybe . I really want to come . ”
36826	36852	36808	36808	Her	638	“ Soon , baby , I promise . First I want you to circle your clit , bring yourself all the way to the edge . ”
36873	36881	36960	36960	Her	638	“ Crey , please . I need — ”
36882	36959	36960	36960	Her	638	“ Turn up the vibe , baby , and then I want it nice and snug up inside that tight little pussy , pressing against your G - spot . I want you to take it deep like you ’d take me . Get yourself there . All the way . I want to hear it right now . Because when I come all over my hand , I want to hear you screaming my name . ”
36971	36993	36963	36963	my	191	“ Crey . . . I ’m gon na . I have to . . . I ca n’t . . . ”
36994	37009	36963	36963	my	191	“ Come for me , Holly . Right now . Right the fuck now . ”
37041	37044	37045	37045	Her	638	“ Crey ! ”
37112	37120	37105	37105	Her	638	“ Crey , are you still there ? ”
37121	37141	37105	37105	Her	638	“ I ’m still here , baby . You just fucking destroyed me from over six hundred miles away . ”
37171	37202	37167	37167	Holly	1176	“ I ’m glad I caught you tonight . I ’m sorry about earlier . Mama came home . She appreciated the vacation . So , thank you for that . ”
37207	37217	37203	37203	My	191	“ Your mother came home ? Are you okay ? ”
37237	37245	37203	37203	My	191	“ Fuck , I should ’ve stayed . ”
37246	37311	37203	37203	My	191	“ It ’s okay , Crey . Do n’t freak out . It was actually . . . good . We talked . I think she and I might actually be in a semi - okay place at the moment . If you were still here , I do n’t think that would ’ve happened , so maybe things needed to happen like this . ”
37321	37342	37315	37315	me	191	“ Are you sure ? Because , fuck , Holly , from what you ’ve told me about your mother — ”
37343	37404	37203	37203	My	191	“ I know , but she ’s still my mama , for better or for worse , and if there ’s a chance it can be for the better , then I need to believe that maybe she has changed . I know I ’ve set myself up for the fall before , but she actually seems different this time . ”
37479	37503	37473	37473	I	191	“ I support you , Holly . So whatever you decide is best for you , I ’m going to support that too . ”
37521	37549	37569	37569	I	191	“ You ’re right , Crey . This is as real as it gets . I love you . I ’ll talk to you in the morning ? ”
37550	37563	37514	37514	my	191	“ Absolutely . I love you too . Good night , baby . ”
38026	38036	38037	38037	I	191	“ Hey , girl , what ’s going on ? ”
38063	38075	38024	38024	Tana	127	“ Have you seen the papers or the gossip sites today ? ”
38083	38099	38076	38076	My	191	“ I ’m not going to like what you have to say , am I ? ”
38100	38108	38046	38046	her	127	“ Oh shit . You have n’t . ”
38109	38120	38121	38121	I	191	“ Nope . No tabloids on my front porch here . ”
38133	38139	38121	38121	I	191	“ How bad is it ? ”
38140	38230	38046	38046	her	127	“ It ’s pretty bad , babe . Your mama sold a tell - all exclusive to Yapper that they posted about ten minutes ago . And this morning , the news also broke about your husband being sued by his own shareholders for corporate fraud or something like that . That was in the Wall Street Journal , not Yapper , but I did n’t know about it until I read the Yapper article and they linked to it . Your names are on everyone ’s lips today . ”
38231	38234	38121	38121	I	191	“ What ? ”
38258	38284	38046	38046	her	127	“ You know how they say no publicity is bad publicity ? Well , today let ’s really hope that ’s true for your sake . ”
38346	38352	38353	38353	I	191	“ What did she say ? ”
38400	38478	38397	38397	she	127	“ I think Creighton probably got the worst of it . I had no idea he was married in college . The whole thing was buried . Rumor has it the girl faked a pregnancy to snag him , and then when she realized he was n’t getting a dime from his uncle , pretended to lose the baby . Everything about you just mostly makes you sound like a girl crazy in love with her husband . ”
38582	38590	38599	38599	Tana	127	“ Tell me about Creighton getting sued . ”
38591	38598	38599	38599	Tana	127	“ You really did n’t know ? ”
38647	38662	38634	38634	I	191	“ Please , Tana ? I would n’t be asking you if I knew . ”
38663	38680	38735	38735	Blood	129	“ Shit . And here I thought you were just the fucking queen of keeping secrets . ”
38681	38688	38634	38634	I	191	“ What are you talking about ? ”
38722	38734	38735	38735	Blood	129	“ He bought Homegrown fucking Records , Holly . For you . ”
38744	38747	38748	38748	I	191	“ What ? ”
38751	38761	38735	38735	Blood	129	“ Holy fuck , you really did n’t know ? ”
38762	38770	38771	38771	My	191	“ No , I did n’t know . ”
38785	38788	38789	38789	she	127	“ Shit , ”
38792	38805	38789	38789	she	127	“ That ’s kinda huge . How could he not tell you ? ”
38815	38824	38825	38825	I	191	“ What else has n’t he told me ? ”
38828	38841	38825	38825	I	191	“ I do n’t know , babe . He ’s your husband . ”
38842	38851	38852	38852	I	191	“ So , what do I do now ? ”
38879	38895	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ Get your ass back to Nashville . Come to my place and lay low . ”
38933	38947	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ Shit . Chance is calling me too . I better take it . ”
38948	38977	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ He ’s gon na tell you the same thing that I am . Get your ass back to town , and your people will circle the wagons . ”
38978	38996	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ Thank you for the heads - up . Now to do damage control on my life . ”
38997	39007	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ You got this , babe . Love you . ”
39020	39030	39031	39031	he	191	“ You heard the news that you ’re news ? ”
39036	39042	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ Yep . Just now . ”
39043	39116	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ Good . Get yourself back to town . You ’re gon na lay low and finish your songs . Boone says he ’ll put you up so you ’re out of the public eye . I ’ll send you Garcia to get the songs finalized , and then you and the band can practice at Boone ’s . We ’re going to cut that album as fast as we fucking can . ”
39130	39140	39126	39126	I	191	“ Slow down , Chance . This is all — ”
39141	39175	38874	38874	Tana	127	“ No time to slow down , kid . As of this morning , you ’re the girl everyone ’s talking about . We need to ride the wave before it goes south . ”
39192	39206	39185	39185	I	191	“ It ’s my goddamn life , Chance . Not a fucking wave . ”
39207	39235	39236	39236	I	191	“ I know , doll . But all you can do is hold on and enjoy the ride . Call me when you get to Boone ’s . ”
40005	40017	39996	39996	Logan	1099	“ Again ? What the hell is your problem with Zeppelin ? ”
40018	40028	40030	40030	I	191	“ They were all men . That ’s enough . ”
40065	40069	40044	40044	Logan	1099	“ Karas again ? ”
40079	40089	40070	40070	I	191	“ Obviously ! Well , him and my mama . ”
40124	40134	40115	40115	Logan	1099	“ You ’ve had a rough morning , girl . ”
40135	40139	40090	40090	I	191	“ No kidding . ”
40140	40146	40115	40115	Logan	1099	“ What can I do ? ”
40158	40168	40147	40147	I	191	“ Two things , if you would n’t mind . ”
40169	40182	40090	40090	I	191	“ Anything you need . All you have to do is ask . ”
40203	40210	40147	40147	I	191	“ Can you sell my Pontiac ? ”
40211	40224	40147	40147	I	191	“ Of course . Just tell me where to send the money . ”
40225	40233	40234	40234	I	191	“ I ’ll worry about that later . ”
40243	40321	40234	40234	I	191	“ I also need you to get a locksmith out to my gran ’s and have the locks changed for me . If you get word my mama ’s back in town , I want her arrested again for breaking and entering if she tries to get back inside . The house is mine , and I do n’t want her in it . Last time she stole stuff , and I ’m finished with that crap . ”
40322	40327	40399	40399	He	1099	“ Consider it done . ”
40353	40368	40399	40399	He	1099	“ You ’re a good man , Logan Brantley . A really good man . ”
40378	40398	40375	40375	he	1099	“ And do n’t you forget it , Holly Wickman . You call me if you ever need anything . ”
40420	40443	40399	40399	He	1099	“ Nashville ai n’t too far , and if you need me , I ’ll be there . Just say the word . ”
40458	40474	40454	40454	I	191	“ Thank you . I ’m glad my car died at this particular gas station . ”
40475	40484	40399	40399	He	1099	“ Me too , honey . Me too . ”
40562	40586	40593	40593	he	692	“ I support you , Holly . So whatever you decide is best for you , I ’m going to support that too . ”
40811	40817	40793	40793	I	191	“ Honey , you called ? ”
40843	40856	40874	40874	they	697	“ Do n’t you know how to answer your phone , woman ? ”
40857	40865	40874	40874	they	697	“ Oh no , he did n’t . ”
40937	40946	40947	40947	she	53	“ Hey , baby . I missed you , ”
40950	40954	40955	40955	I	191	“ Everyone out , ”
40978	40985	40986	40986	I	191	“ What are you doing here ? ”
41018	41049	41012	41012	she	53	“ I support you , Crey . Whatever decisions you made about what to tell me or not tell me , I ’m assuming you made them for a reason . ”
41050	41053	41012	41012	she	53	“ Holly — ”
41054	41060	41012	41012	she	53	“ I ’m not done . ”
41069	41078	41061	41061	My	191	“ Then by all means , please continue . ”
41098	41199	41085	41085	I	191	“ Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m disappointed that you did n’t tell me about Homegrown , but I ’m assuming you had a reason for not telling me . So instead of running to Nashville like I was told , I decided it was time to show you that I know how to run to you just as well as I know how to run away . So here I am . This shitstorm would n’t exist if you ’d never met me , and my place is right beside you while we wade through the muck . ”
41214	41226	41201	41201	her	704	“ You ’re a hell of a woman , Holly Karas . ”
41227	41239	41201	41201	her	704	“ Because of you , I ’m starting to believe that . ”
41249	41296	41240	41240	I	191	“ Fuck , am I glad to see you . And for the record , if you ’d run back to Nashville , I would ’ve come after you again . Every time . Until you tell me to stop . And probably even after that . ”
41311	41321	41322	41322	she	704	“ Like I ’d ever tell you to stop , ”
41358	41366	41367	41367	I	191	“ Might as well just climb me . ”
41448	41463	41464	41464	Cannon	327	“ Seriously , Crey ? We do n’t have time for this right now . ”
41487	41493	41494	41494	I	191	“ Get the fuck out , ”
41497	41517	41464	41464	Cannon	327	“ You pay me too much money to let you fuck around when we need to be fixing shit . ”
41536	41550	41518	41518	Holly	1176	“ Cannon , I do n’t believe we ’ve formally met in person . ”
41608	41616	41596	41596	Cannon	327	“ Nice to meet you , Holly . ”
41617	41656	41596	41596	Cannon	327	“ I ’d say likewise , but I do n’t really like you . Actually , I kind of think you ’re a jerk . And now I know for sure you ’re a total cock - blocker . ”
41704	41707	41708	41708	Cannon	327	“ Well , ”
41720	41769	41708	41708	Cannon	327	“ we really need to continue our strategy session so we can get this issue handled . We ’ve got less than twenty - four hours before you ’ve got to stand up in front of a room full of investors , and we need a solid explanation . ”
41770	41812	41856	41856	Holly	1176	“ There ’s nothing more to strategize at this point . The investors are n’t stupid . They deserve more than a solid explanation . They deserve the truth , and that ’s exactly what I ’m going to give them . ”
41813	41855	41708	41708	Cannon	327	“ Fuck , Crey . The truth ? That you lost your fucking mind over a piece of ass , so you married her and bought her goddamn record label because you did n’t like that they were bullying her around ? ”
41939	41946	41921	41921	Cannon	327	“ What the hell , man ? ”
41947	41963	41921	41921	Cannon	327	“ You ’re fired . And you ’re fucking lucky I do n’t kill you . ”
41964	41969	41970	41970	Holly	1176	“ Creighton , wait . ”
41979	41993	41970	41970	Holly	1176	“ He ’s clearly an idiot , but he ’s your best friend . ”
41994	42003	41921	41921	Cannon	327	“ Which is why he ’s not dead . ”
42004	42007	41970	41970	Holly	1176	“ Crey — ”
42008	42016	41921	41921	Cannon	327	“ Shut your fucking mouth , Cannon . ”
42017	42039	41970	41970	Holly	1176	“ No , Cannon , open it and apologize . And then maybe my husband will give you your job back . ”
42040	42045	42046	42046	I	191	“ No fucking way , ”
42099	42116	42123	42123	he	171	“ I ’m sorry , Holly . I apologize for running my mouth like a jackass . ”
42126	42166	42123	42123	he	171	“ I ’m just looking out for you , Crey . I swear , I just did n’t think . And that ’s how the press is going to see it too . We just need to be prepared . ”
42193	42265	42267	42267	she	1176	“ You ca n’t fire him over this , Crey . Hit him again , maybe . But then go take him out for a beer and get back to solid ground . He ’s just looking out for you , and he ’s been important to you for a lot longer than I have . I wo n’t be the reason that breaks . So , figure your shit out . ”
42272	42323	42267	42267	she	1176	“ But if you ever call me a piece of ass again , I ’ll immortalize you in a song , and I promise , you will not like how it ends . And that ’ll be after I take my best shot at knocking your perfect freaking teeth out . ”
42332	42389	42329	42329	she	1176	“ I ’m going to go back to the penthouse now to try to finish up these songs and do damage control with Chance . I ’ll be waiting when you ’ve finished up your meetings . I actually feel like blowing off my diet and cooking tonight . So make sure you bring your appetite . ”
42446	42460	42439	42439	I	191	“ I ’m glad you ’re here , Holly . Really fucking glad . ”
42461	42469	42431	42431	she	1176	“ Nowhere else I ’d rather be . ”
42515	42521	42439	42439	I	191	“ Is your kitchen stocked ? ”
42525	42538	42522	42522	I	191	“ Yes , but I ’ll have a car take you home . ”
42544	42565	42539	42539	She	1176	“ Okay , Crey . I ’ll make something that ’ll keep , no matter how late you get home . ”
42591	42604	42608	42608	she	1176	“ I ’ll be home as soon as I can , baby . ”
42657	42710	42711	42711	He	327	“ One more meeting with the lawyers . You lay out whatever plan you ’ve got . They ’ll tell you it ’s inadvisable . You ’ll decide , fuck it , I ’m CEO and therefore I can do whatever the fuck I want , and you ’ll do it anyway . ”
42729	42740	42722	42722	I	191	“ Is that about how this is going to go ? ”
42744	42747	42741	42741	I	191	“ Yes . ”
42748	42766	42741	42741	I	191	“ Then let ’s get it over with quickly so you can get home to the wife . ”
42778	42782	42774	42774	he	327	“ Sounds good . ”
42844	42848	42839	42839	I	191	“ America ’s Sweetheart ”
42884	42894	42895	42895	I	191	“ Hey , baby . Hope you ’re hungry . ”
42917	42933	42934	42934	I	191	“ Goddamn , I do n’t know what smells better — you or the chicken . ”
42937	42953	42934	42934	I	191	“ I ’m going to assume that ’s a compliment and just roll with it . ”
42965	42978	42954	42954	He	138	“ It is . And I ’ll be having you for dessert . ”
43024	43029	43030	43030	Crey	394	“ That sounds fabulous . ”
43085	43094	43143	43143	I	191	“ What are you feeding me , woman ? ”
43095	43114	43115	43115	I	191	“ Are you in caveman mode now ? See woman , she cook . She must feed man , ”
43123	43142	43115	43115	I	191	“ If you want to play that game later , I ’ll drag you back to my cave . ”
43199	43213	43446	43446	Crey	394	“ You ’re crazy , Crey . And I love that about you . ”
43251	43281	43446	43446	Crey	394	“ Baby , I ’ve got hot oil on the stove . You need to let me finish frying the chicken , and then we can pick this up . ”
43291	43300	43282	43282	He	723	“ You already open a bottle of wine ? ”
43301	43326	43282	43282	He	723	“ Nope . Left that to you . I ’d probably pick something that clashed horribly with the masterpiece we ’re about to eat . ”
43327	43347	43282	43282	He	723	“ You realize I do n’t give a shit if you picked the wrong wine , do n’t you ? ”
43348	43445	43282	43282	He	723	“ I know , but still . I did n’t want to start drinking without you . Your wine is the good stuff , so I probably would ’ve had one glass , and it would ’ve been so delicious that I would ’ve needed another glass . And maybe another . Especially after this disaster of a day . And then you would ’ve come home to burned - to - crap fried chicken , hard - as - a - brick cornbread , sloppy baked beans , squishy broccoli , and flambéed cherry cobbler . ”
43456	43462	43446	43446	Crey	394	“ You made all that ? ”
43463	43476	43446	43446	Crey	394	“ Uh - huh . And it ’s going to be fabulous . ”
43477	43493	43446	43446	Crey	394	“ Well , damn . I do n’t even know what to say to that . ”
43494	43513	43446	43446	Crey	394	“ You do n’t have to say anything . Just eat it . And then me . After . ”
43550	43571	43536	43536	Crey	394	“ Oh , baby , you feeling neglected ? Because I ’ll eat that sweet pussy of yours for days . ”
43580	43596	43578	43578	me	191	“ Days are n’t really necessary . I ’d settle for a really vigorous hour . ”
43630	43648	43597	43597	Crey	394	“ Damn . You are one sexy son of a bitch . You know that , right ? ”
43656	43668	43652	43652	his	394	“ Well , if I did n’t , I do now . ”
43669	43677	43597	43597	Crey	394	“ I ’m suddenly not very hungry . ”
43686	43727	43597	43597	Crey	394	“ Patience , baby . Patience . Besides , a man only gets to eat like this once in a while , and I ’m not missing out on my shot . But I think dessert can wait until after . ”
43728	43737	43652	43652	his	394	“ Deal . Let ’s eat . Fast . ”
43882	43997	43864	43864	they	724	“ Welcome to Karas International ’s Annual Investor Day . As chairman of the board and chief executive officer , it ’s my pleasure to welcome you . I ’d like to open with a statement that will address what I ’m sure is a matter many of you have come seeking answers about — the purchase of Homegrown Records by an independent entity owned by me personally , which prompted a lawsuit filed by a shareholder on behalf of Karas International . The suit alleges that as a company executive and member of its board , this purchase breaches my duty of loyalty both to the company and to you , its shareholders . ”
44044	44131	44135	44136	the audience	726	“ I ’d like to be the first to tell you that the allegations contained in that suit are complete and utter bullshit . The purchase of Homegrown was not in any way made to usurp an opportunity that would have been appropriate to our company ’s current or contemplated business portfolio , nor would it have been beneficial to Karas International . For the record , Homegrown has already cost me over thirty million dollars of capital infusion just to keep the damn thing running . ”
44147	44184	44135	44136	the audience	726	“ If you ’ll hold your comments until the end , I ’ll take your questions until you do n’t have any more . But I ’d appreciate your courtesy so I can finish my statement . ”
44197	44282	44135	44136	the audience	726	“ However , I will agree that the proper procedure to avoid any hint of impropriety and to forestall any grounds for the allegations supporting the suit would have been to have the independent members of the board of directors vote on the transaction . I ’m sure you ’re wondering why I did n’t go that route , and I only have one answer for you . Have you ever been so absolutely in love that you ’ve stopped thinking about practicalities entirely ? ”
44306	44399	44429	44429	she	1176	“ I ’m a man in love with an amazing woman , and while that argument will not hold weight in a court of law , in a court of public opinion , I think it makes perfect sense . The purchase of Homegrown was meant to be a surprise belated wedding present for my new wife , so I acted quickly , and perhaps without thinking things through in my normal logical fashion , because I wanted to do it before my beautiful , intelligent bride realized what I was doing . ”
44456	44479	44446	44446	I	191	“ So , there you go . That ’s the explanation I have for you . Now I ’ll take your questions . ”
44493	44518	44524	44524	Damon	142	“ You really think that ridiculous explanation is going to matter ? Not likely , Creighton . I thought you were smarter than that . ”
44575	44589	44590	44590	she	1176	“ You know how to give one hell of a speech , Crey , ”
44601	44609	44590	44590	she	1176	“ I meant every word of it . ”
44610	44618	44590	44590	she	1176	“ Is Homegrown really my wedding present ? ”
44637	44646	44629	44629	I	191	“ Yes . It was always for you . ”
44656	44667	44647	44647	Her	1176	“ Does that mean you expect me to run it ? ”
44668	44717	44647	44647	Her	1176	“ If you want to ; you can do whatever you want . The management team I ’ve got in place now is starting to turn things around , but if you want to get involved with the business side of things , you ’re more than welcome . ”
44730	44761	44718	44718	I	191	“ I think that ’d be sexy as fuck , if you want to know the truth . . . my wife , the CEO , running her own empire . ”
44796	44799	44803	44803	Cannon	327	“ Crey . ”
44838	44844	44815	44815	Holly	1176	“ What do you need ? ”
44845	44855	44815	44815	Holly	1176	“ What are you going to do about Damon ? ”
44856	44865	44815	44815	Holly	1176	“ Besides take a hit out on him ? ”
44873	44879	44866	44866	Cannon	327	“ I know a guy . ”
44880	44891	44892	44892	He	734	“ Jesus . Fuck , Cannon . I ’m joking . ”
44895	44899	44892	44892	He	734	“ Desperate times . ”
44900	44926	44892	44892	He	734	“ And that ’s called conspiracy , and I do n’t care to find out the New York prison system ’s policy on conjugal visits . ”
44933	44939	44930	44930	Holly	1176	“ Can I second that ? ”
44960	44967	44949	44949	He	735	“ Oh no , he did n’t ”
44974	45013	45020	45020	she	1176	“ Mr. Karas , Mr. Cramer wanted to run one more idea by you , given your uncle ’s latest outburst . Could we have a few minutes of your time in the conference room across the hall ? ”
45023	45066	45020	45020	she	1176	“ Crey , do your thing . I ’ll be waiting . I ’m feeling an epic song about revenge coming on , à la Carrie Underwood ’s ‘ Two Black Cadillacs ’ or maybe ‘ Good - bye , Earl . ’ ”
45078	45091	45070	45070	I	191	“ I love you , woman . I ’ll be right back . ”
45092	45103	45020	45020	she	1176	“ Give ’em hell . And I love you too . ”
45161	45199	45150	45150	he	143	“ Save your breath , Cramer . You did n’t approve before , and you do n’t approve now . I also know you ’re not going to approve of what I ’m going to do next . ”
45200	45209	45210	45210	he	143	“ And what ’s that , Mr. Karas ? ”
45268	45302	45343	45343	He	743	“ My uncle may be brave enough to take me on in front of a crowd , but we ’ll see how he feels about taking me on man - to - man . ”
45314	45320	45303	45304	The lawyer	743	“ That ’s highly inadvisable . ”
45321	45333	45334	45334	My	191	“ Consider it a family matter and none of your concern . ”
45346	45365	45343	45343	He	743	“ Mr. Karas , we have your best interests in mind here . I ’m sure you understand . ”
45366	45401	45303	45304	The lawyer	743	“ Of course , Mr. Cramer , but sometimes the only thing a bully understands is a bigger bully . It ’s time the gloves come off . I ’m done with his bullshit . ”
45402	45425	45343	45343	He	743	“ You ’re not going to listen to a logical , reasoned argument , no matter what I say , are you ? ”
45426	45442	45303	45304	The lawyer	743	“ There ’s no reasoning with my uncle , so no . Save your breath . ”
45443	45446	45447	45447	Cramer	143	“ Fine . ”
45450	45469	45447	45447	Cramer	143	“ We ’ll leave you to it . Please call us if we can be of further assistance . ”
45478	45486	45470	45470	I	191	“ Cannon , walk out with me ? ”
45498	45510	45511	45511	he	143	“ You ’re not staying for the rest of Investor Day ? ”
45514	45521	45511	45511	he	143	“ You have a closing keynote . ”
45529	45575	45522	45522	I	191	“ You think I do n’t know that ? I ’ll try to be back in time . If I ’m not , extend the dog - and - pony show . You ’ve got promo videos and PowerPoints up the ass . Use something . ”
45576	45584	45585	45585	I	191	“ And if that does n’t work ? ”
45647	45660	45644	45644	I	191	“ Improvise . That ’s why I pay you the big bucks . ”
45679	45682	45644	45644	I	191	“ Crey . ”
45689	45692	45683	45683	I	191	“ What ? ”
45693	45739	45671	45671	he	327	“ Damon is fucking crazy . What he ’s doing — his issue with you — that ’s not based in logic . It never has been . Be careful . I do n’t trust him , and I do n’t think you should either . ”
45747	45759	45740	45740	I	191	“ I know . This has been a long time coming . ”
45760	45766	45800	45800	she	1176	“ Good luck , man . ”
45813	45827	45800	45800	she	1176	“ I bet if I were naked , you ’d notice me quicker . ”
45841	45855	45800	45800	she	1176	“ Damn straight , I would . That dick of yours demands attention . ”
45856	45861	45800	45800	she	1176	“ Later . Definitely . ”
45862	45895	45800	45800	she	1176	“ Count on it . After all , I hear I got a hell of a wedding present , which means you ’ve got a hell of a thank - you coming . ”
45896	45907	45800	45800	she	1176	“ Maybe I should book the room at the Plaza ? ”
45908	45935	45800	45800	she	1176	“ Screw the Plaza . Let ’s go back to Vegas . I did n’t get nearly enough time to enjoy that villa at Caesar ’s . ”
45951	45972	45940	45940	she	1176	“ Deal . We sort this out , and you and I are going to high roll it in Vegas . ”
45984	46010	45973	45973	Holly	1176	“ I ’m going to head back to the penthouse to finish this song and pack . So , hurry up and sort it out . ”
46011	46020	46021	46021	Her	1176	“ I ’ll consider those my marching orders . ”
46054	46068	46083	46083	I	191	“ I ’ll call you as soon as I ’m on my way . ”
46069	46073	46083	46083	I	191	“ You better . ”
46173	46185	46186	46186	I	191	“ Looks like we ’re headed to the estate , Michael , ”
46191	46206	46186	46186	I	191	“ Very good , sir . I ’m assuming we ’re in a hurry ? ”
46207	46213	46186	46186	I	191	“ Are n’t we always ? ”
46223	46227	46214	46214	I	191	“ Of course . ”
46858	46865	46866	46866	I	191	“ I wo n’t be long , ”
46879	46884	46866	46866	I	191	“ Yes , sir . ”
46904	46915	46916	46917	The housekeeper	776	“ Elisabetta , it ’s good to see you again . ”
46939	46946	46947	46947	She	1062	“ This way , Mr. Creighton . ”
47025	47041	47042	47042	His	1062	“ Figured you ’d show up . It ’s always good to be proven right . ”
47062	47065	47050	47050	his	1062	“ Damon . ”
47066	47069	47050	47050	his	1062	“ Creighton . ”
47070	47091	47050	47050	his	1062	“ I do n’t expect you to offer me a seat . I always enjoy being proven right as well . ”
47102	47143	47092	47092	His	1062	“ I do n’t know what you think coming here is going to accomplish , but you might as well say what you ’ve got to say and get out . Know in advance that you ’re wasting my time . ”
47202	47327	47194	47194	His	1062	“ I came to end this , because quite frankly , Damon , you ’re wasting my time , and I ’m fucking sick of it . I ’ve got better things to do than dicking around with all this petty activist shareholder bullshit , and so do you . We both know it . You ’ve hated me since I was a kid ; I do n’t particularly care why . But we ’re both adults , and we ’re both businessmen . So how about we talk in terms that we both understand and respect — money . I want your shares . What ’s it going to take to get you out of my company and out of my fucking life ? ”
47377	47388	47389	47389	He	1062	“ You want my shares ? You can have them . ”
47408	47428	47389	47389	He	1062	“ All you have to do is change your fucking last name and take it off your goddamn company . ”
47459	47471	47472	47472	My	191	“ What the hell are you talking about , old man ? ”
47545	47582	47520	47520	His	1062	“ You do n’t deserve that name . You never fucking did . Your whore of a mother got it for you by seducing my little brother . She ruined his fucking life . Killed him . ”
47612	47624	47609	47609	he	1062	“ Explain yourself before I fucking beat it out of you . ”
47636	47668	47633	47633	his	1062	“ You ’ve never wondered why Greer actually looks Greek and you do n’t ? Oh , you ’ve got Mediterranean heritage , but it did n’t come from this family . ”
47730	47738	47739	47739	I	191	“ What the fuck are you saying ? ”
47785	47956	47957	47957	His	784	“ Do n’t you get it , Crey ? The only reason you were n’t born a fucking bastard is because your mother seduced my brother into marrying her before you were born . She got knocked up by a married man , and her family threw her out . My brother was a sucker . A good kid . A fucking junior in college . He was going to do great things — join me in the business . But he met her , and he would n’t listen . They got married six weeks later without telling anyone . When we found out and tried to talk him into annulling it , he dug in his heels . Joined that damn church and moved out of the city . Five years later , they ended up in Papua fucking New Guinea , and we all know how that ended . She as good as killed him herself . He never would ’ve been there if not for her . ”
47990	48004	48019	48020	My father	781	“ You ’re telling me that David Karas was not my biological father . ”
48011	48018	48005	48005	Damon	142	“ No . He was n’t . ”
48056	48073	48081	48081	I	191	“ But he ’s Greer ’s father , because she was born in Papua New Guinea . ”
48074	48080	48081	48081	I	191	“ Unless your whore mother — ”
48100	48106	48087	48087	my	191	“ Shut your fucking mouth . ”
48107	48114	48115	48115	he	781	“ Get your hands off me , ”
48122	48130	48087	48087	my	191	“ Tell me who my father is . ”
48131	48136	48087	48087	my	191	“ Let me go . ”
48137	48141	48142	48142	I	191	“ I said — ”
48151	48165	48142	48142	I	191	“ Tell me who my fucking father is . You have to know . ”
48178	48186	48174	48174	he	781	“ A capo in La Casa Nostra . ”
48206	48211	48203	48204	The Mafia	788	“ You ’re lying . ”
48212	48218	48241	48241	He	781	“ No reason to lie . ”
48235	48240	48219	48219	I	191	“ You have proof ? ”
48244	48256	48241	48241	He	781	“ DNA test . Pulled strings when you were a kid . ”
48275	48284	48257	48258	The man	191	“ How did you not end up dead ? ”
48303	48308	48298	48298	He	781	“ I know people . ”
48309	48341	48298	48298	He	781	“ Well , you can go fuck yourself . This stays between us . I ’m not changing my name . You take that request and shove it up your ass . ”
48342	48388	48298	48298	He	781	“ Then get ready to lose your entire company . I will drag you through court and destroy your reputation by dissecting every move you ’ve ever made . I ’ll be so far up your ass , you ’ll taste me with every breath . ”
48429	48447	48406	48406	his	790	“ You ’re going to cost yourself everything . You wo n’t walk away clean from this . ”
48448	48454	48455	48455	he	790	“ I do n’t care , ”
48458	48486	48455	48455	he	790	“ I ’m going to be a thorn in your side for the rest of your fucking life , like you ’ve been a thorn in mine ! ”
48502	48527	48494	48494	I	191	“ Why ? And if all you want from me is to change my name , why wait until now ? Why not earlier ? ”
48536	48632	48528	48528	Damon	142	“ Every time I miss my brother — his birthday , our annual fishing trip , the World fucking Series , every time I see your goddamn picture in the paper , it makes me sick . If you did n’t exist , I ’d still have him . It would be a fair trade , in my mind . And since I ca n’t have him back , it gives me some small measure of satisfaction to know that I can make you even a fraction as miserable as I am for losing him . ”
48672	48695	48759	48759	His	191	“ There ’s something so fucked up about that , I do n’t even know where to begin . You need help . ”
48700	48758	48696	48696	He	191	“ No one can bring him back . And now you ’ve proven that blood will always tell . Your mother was trash , and now you ’ve married trash . You ’ve tarnished the family name with your stunt , and I ’m done sharing it with you . I wo n’t stop until I win . ”
48879	48888	48875	48875	I	191	“ Let ’s go home . And hurry . ”
48940	48943	48917	48917	Crey	394	“ Crey ? ”
48980	48995	48996	48996	He	394	“ What happened ? Is it bad ? He did n’t take your deal ? ”
49016	49024	49025	49025	His	394	“ My father was n’t my father . ”
49038	49041	49042	49042	I	191	“ What ? ”
49045	49054	49025	49025	His	394	“ My mother was pregnant when they met . ”
49094	49107	49113	49113	I	191	“ Oh my God . Do you know who . . . ? ”
49108	49112	49077	49077	I	191	“ Not exactly . ”
49169	49186	49213	49213	Crey	394	“ But Damon did tell me he was married , and he was in the Mafia . ”
49187	49190	49191	49191	I	191	“ What ! ”
49223	49236	49213	49213	Crey	394	“ Yeah . Apparently I ’m half Sicilian and not half Greek . ”
49241	49272	49237	49237	I	191	“ I guess I can see it . But holy shit , Crey . Holy shit . You ca n’t make this shit up . I mean , holy shit . ”
49297	49352	49291	49291	he	781	“ Fuck me , I know . Damon said he was a capo , and that was before I was born . He ’s probably dead or in prison now . But Jesus fucking Christ . I went to buy back stock in my own company , not a place in the Five Families . ”
49390	49404	49405	49405	Crey	394	“ This is like real Godfather - type shit , is n’t it ? ”
49410	49453	49405	49405	Crey	394	“ It changes nothing . I ’m still exactly the same man . I ’m a product of my experiences . The source of my DNA does n’t change me . And I ’m sure as shit not changing my last name . ”
49454	49463	49464	49464	I	191	“ Why would you change your last name ? ”
49470	49486	49405	49405	Crey	394	“ That was Damon ’s price to leave me — to leave us — alone . ”
49487	49493	49405	49405	Crey	394	“ What an arrogant asshole ! ”
49494	49500	49501	49501	Crey	394	“ Calm down , baby , ”
49514	49556	49509	49509	I	191	“ Fuck calming down . I ’m about to go backwoods on his ass . I like my new last name . I may not be using it onstage , but I ’m sure as hell not giving it up now . ”
49568	49648	49558	49558	Crey	394	“ You are an amazing woman . If anyone had told me that I ’d be smiling this soon after having the foundation of my entire existence rocked , I would ’ve told them they were insane . Because I remember , with startling clarity , you telling me that I was under no circumstances to call you Mrs. Creighton Karas again , or I ’d be at risk of being immortalized in a song about a nutless wonder . ”
49649	49654	49655	49655	I	191	“ You do listen . ”
49660	49699	49655	49655	I	191	“ And that was purely a matter of your this is my woman , and I own her like property tone at the time that I took exception to . It had nothing to do with your name . ”
49728	49761	49710	49710	I	191	“ This is what I needed . You . In my arms . God , now I ’m really tempted to consider Cannon ’s suggestion about taking a hit out on Damon . ”
49773	49790	49762	49762	I	191	“ That ’s the Mafioso blood in you talking now , baby . I like it . ”
49791	49805	49762	49762	I	191	“ Well , right now I just want to forget this entire morning . ”
49888	49892	49885	49885	Crey	394	“ Ignore it . ”
49893	49922	49885	49885	Crey	394	“ We ca n’t ignore it . You know it ’s Cannon , and if he left the Investor Day festivities , it ’s got to be important . ”
49923	49929	49885	49885	Crey	394	“ You ’re more important . ”
49957	49965	49949	49949	he	394	“ How about I get the door ? ”
49974	49977	49978	49978	he	394	“ Fine , ”
49983	49994	49978	49978	he	394	“ But tell him he ’s an asshole for interrupting . ”
49995	49999	50000	50000	He	394	“ I will . ”
50059	50069	50070	50071	My sister	1062	“ Crey ! What the hell is going on ? ”
50087	50097	50070	50071	My sister	1062	“ Greer , meet Holly . Holly , Greer . ”
50106	50142	50098	50098	Greer	101	“ I ’m so sorry . I ’m not usually so rude . But normally my aunt does n’t call me to tell me you ’re my half brother and your dad is a mobster . ”
50152	50164	50143	50143	Holly	1176	“ Do n’t worry , we ’re still absorbing the news . ”
50181	50191	50171	50171	her	1062	“ Seriously ? What the hell is going on ? ”
50192	50212	50213	50213	I	191	“ It ’s okay , Gree . You probably know just as much as we do at this point . ”
50223	50235	50213	50213	I	191	“ You said Aunt Katherine told you ? That ’s shocking . ”
50241	50316	50236	50236	Greer	101	“ She was damn near incoherent , and I ’m assuming near the bottom of a bottle of something . She rambled about never approving of how he treated you , and that you had no control over what your mother did . Sins of the father ; blah , blah , blah . I just needed to make sure you were n’t freaking out and getting ready to kill Uncle Damon or something . ”
50317	50326	50327	50327	I	191	“ I ’m still working out a solution , ”
50351	50382	50236	50236	Greer	101	“ Well , shit . Now I ’m going to have to take the stairs when I leave . Do you have to live on the top floor , Crey ? ”
50383	50400	50402	50402	Holly	1176	“ It ’ll come back on in a second . The building has a backup generator . ”
50421	50445	50418	50418	I	191	“ I ’m sorry you two had to meet like this . I ’d anticipated something a little less . . . dramatic . ”
50476	50492	50465	50465	she	1176	“ I have a feeling our lives are going to be dramatic for a while . ”
50493	50497	50498	50498	Greer	101	“ Not mine , ”
50501	50522	50498	50498	Greer	101	“ Mine is boring and is going to stay boring . No freaking missed connections gone viral for this girl . ”
50587	50592	50593	50593	Holly	1176	“ That ’s it , ”
50596	50614	50593	50593	Holly	1176	“ I ’m done with New York . People walk through walls here ? Hell . No . ”
50742	50745	50746	50746	His	810	“ Creighton . ”
50767	50780	50781	50781	I	191	“ You sure know how to make one hell of an entrance , ”
50784	50806	50781	50781	I	191	“ I believe I ’m at a disadvantage . I know who you are , but not what your name is . ”
50819	50833	50781	50781	I	191	“ Domenico Casso . Dom . And yes , I ’m your father . ”
50901	50907	50908	50908	I	191	“ How did you — ? ”
50984	50987	51030	51030	her	820	“ Elisabetta . ”
50988	50991	51030	51030	her	820	“ What ? ”
50992	51024	51030	51030	her	820	“ She ’s kept tabs on you for years . The whole of your life that you ’ve lived with your aunt and uncle . She ’s one of my people . ”
51051	51058	51030	51030	her	820	“ Elisabetta is on your payroll ? ”
51062	51068	51059	51059	He	17	“ May we come in ? ”
51130	51134	51126	51126	I	191	“ Please do . ”
51172	51180	51135	51135	They	822	“ Damon said you were a capo . ”
51191	51216	51135	51135	They	822	“ That was a long time ago . I ’ve . . . moved up in the family . CEO , if you will . ”
51217	51221	51222	51222	Holly	1176	“ Not surprising , ”
51251	51276	51243	51243	he	157	“ I was happy to hear you found yourself a good woman . Although perhaps a little surprised by how you went about it . ”
51281	51294	51277	51277	My	191	“ Have you really been keeping tabs on me my whole life ? ”
51308	51351	51295	51295	He	157	“ Not the first ten years . You were beyond even me then , and you had your parents . But after they passed away and you came back to New York ? Yes . I ’ve made sure to keep tabs . ”
51352	51356	51396	51396	He	157	“ But why ? ”
51357	51371	51295	51295	He	157	“ Because whether you knew it or not , you ’re my son . ”
51387	51395	51382	51382	I	191	“ Would you ever have told me ? ”
51485	51512	51479	51479	He	157	“ No . I never would ’ve told you . But now that Damon has run his mouth , I had no choice but to intervene . ”
51513	51521	51522	51522	I	191	“ An inconvenience , I ’m sure , ”
51529	51574	51522	51522	I	191	“ One I was ready for . I ’m actually surprised he ’s held it in this long . Elisabetta has been waiting twenty - some years to make this call . But the timing works in your favor , as well as mine . ”
51575	51581	51522	51522	I	191	“ What do you mean ? ”
51596	51650	51522	51522	I	191	“ He used his connections a long time ago to get information he should never have had . I knew he had it , and as long as he did nothing with it , I would do nothing with him . But he ’s broken the balance , and it must be righted . ”
51666	51692	51651	51651	Holly	1176	“ I ’m sorry , Dom . We ’re going to need to rewind the last thirty seconds and pretend we did n’t hear that . ”
51701	51712	51693	51693	I	191	“ I think you should go in the other room . ”
51720	51725	51713	51713	Her	1176	“ Not a chance . ”
51737	51740	51713	51713	Her	1176	“ Holly — ”
51741	51744	51786	51786	Holly	1176	“ Crey — ”
51745	51750	51751	51751	Dom	157	“ Children , children , ”
51754	51785	51751	51751	Dom	157	“ The last thing I want is to cause marital strife . After having thirty years with my own wife , I can understand that these early days are delicate . ”
51802	51805	51786	51786	Holly	1176	“ Holly . ”
51806	51809	51810	51810	Dom	157	“ Crey . ”
51813	51863	51810	51810	Dom	157	“ Yes . I know what she ’s thinking , as well . And no , I was n’t faithful to my wife . I should regret that , but then your husband would n’t exist . So , Mrs. Karas , how would you like me to respond ? ”
51885	51935	51876	51876	Dom	157	“ I understand your hesitance to know anything about my plans for Damon . That ’s fine . But my world is not your world . A move like his can not go unchecked . I stay in my position by exercising iron - clad control over my domain . ”
51941	52051	51936	51936	I	191	“ I want his shares back ; I do n’t want him dead . The problem with him ending up dead is that I ’ll be the prime suspect , regardless of how it happens . We ’re in the middle of one shitstorm right now , but it ’s a corporate litigation matter . A criminal investigation and potential charges would be a whole different ball game , and I want nothing to do with that . If my stock price has taken a hit from the derivative suit , it ’s nothing compared to what would happen if I were questioned in Damon ’s disappearance or murder . ”
52089	52096	52097	52097	He	830	“ You raise a good point . ”
52118	52135	52097	52097	He	830	“ Hmm , you say you just want your shares back ? That solves your problem ? ”
52136	52153	52154	52154	I	191	“ Yes . The lawsuit goes away if he ’s not a shareholder to maintain it , ”
52157	52179	52180	52180	he	830	“ After the suit has been dropped a while , I ’m assuming you do n’t care what happens to him ? ”
52183	52208	52209	52209	I	191	“ I did n’t say that . He was n’t a complete dick to Greer , and it would hurt her to lose him . ”
52240	52262	52233	52233	Dom	157	“ I assumed that ’s who has been watching me so closely . It ’s lovely to meet you , Greer . ”
52270	52277	52278	52278	She	101	“ Likewise , I ’m sure . ”
52284	52307	52278	52278	She	101	“ I ’ve seen you before . With the two guard dogs . In Midtown one night when I was leaving work . ”
52313	52343	52308	52308	Dom	157	“ You take too many chances with your safety , Ms. Karas . You ’ve been lucky my men have been keeping tabs and have intervened on your behalf . ”
52358	52361	52344	52344	Holly	1176	“ What ? ”
52362	52398	52344	52344	Holly	1176	“ I extend my protection to you out of courtesy to your brother because I know it would trouble him for you to be injured . But that ’s no reason to be so careless . ”
52415	52418	52419	52419	I	191	“ Fuck . ”
52433	52452	52419	52419	I	191	“ Greer , you ’re getting a bodyguard . Do n’t argue with me . It ’s happening . ”
52472	52482	52483	52483	Dom	157	“ I ’m happy to recommend some competent ones , ”
52493	52508	52512	52512	he	157	“ I ’ll take care of it , but thank you for the offer . ”
52525	52547	52512	52512	he	157	“ Now about Damon . You ’ll have his stock certificate in hand tomorrow . Consider it a belated wedding present . ”
52555	52598	52548	52548	He	157	“ I ’ll be keeping tabs on your mother , as well . If she gets out of line again , we ’ll make sure she ’s encouraged to not make the same mistake again . I believe that concludes our business . ”
52603	52612	52599	52599	Holly	1176	“ You ’re not going to . . . ”
52616	52627	52613	52613	He	157	“ No . But she wo n’t be a problem . ”
52641	52661	52628	52628	Dom	157	“ It was nice to finally meet you . I do n’t expect we ’ll see each other again . ”
52669	52691	52628	52628	Dom	157	“ And if you ’re wondering , the wiring in your building has malfunctioned mysteriously , and we were never here . ”
52705	52713	52692	52692	Holly	1176	“ And the doorman and other residents ? ”
52719	52755	52714	52714	He	157	“ We did n’t exactly use the front door . We ’ll see ourselves out . Take care , Creighton . It was lovely to meet you , Holly . Good luck at the CMAs . ”
52805	52839	52801	52801	Holly	1176	“ Holy cow , Creighton . Holy cow - tipping , runnin ’ from the cops , falling into a pile of shit . Oh my God , did that really just happen ? ”
52848	52853	52843	52843	I	191	“ Holy fucking shit . ”
52854	52865	52866	52866	Holly	1176	“ Do you think you ’ll ever see him again ? ”
52884	52902	52876	52876	I	191	“ I have no idea . But my guess is , not unless he wants me to . ”
52993	53015	52988	52988	Greer	101	“ As much as I ’m a little freaked out right now to leave your place , I got ta go . ”
53031	53055	53023	53023	she	439	“ You ’re getting a bodyguard . No more walking around Manhattan late at night because you do n’t leave work until two a.m. ”
53056	53069	53070	53070	she	439	“ I ’m not going to win this one , am I ? ”
53073	53076	53023	53023	she	439	“ No . ”
53077	53089	53023	53023	she	439	“ I respectfully reserve the right to argue the point later . ”
53090	53124	53023	53023	she	439	“ Spoken like a lawyer . I ’m calling Michael . He ’ll be waiting downstairs in less than ten minutes . Do n’t leave the building until you see him pull up . ”
53132	53135	53125	53125	Greer	101	“ Fine . ”
53148	53156	53136	53136	She	439	“ Call me if anything crazy happens . ”
53162	53170	53157	53157	I	191	“ Of course . Now , go . ”
53204	53212	53198	53198	She	439	“ Are we still on for Vegas ? ”
53245	53249	53250	53250	She	439	“ Hell yes . ”
53253	53263	53250	53250	She	439	“ Good . Then I have one more question . ”
53283	53288	53264	53264	Her	439	“ What , baby ? ”
53289	53309	53310	53310	She	439	“ Does that make you a Mafia prince ? I ’m not trying to make light of the situation . ”
53316	53371	53310	53310	She	439	“ I swear , I ’m not . Because this is crazy and emotional and intense . And just plain crazy . But that Mafia prince thing . . . if you ’re down for some role - play when we ’re in Vegas , I ’m not going to say no to that . ”
53421	53433	53411	53411	I	191	“ Let ’s see what happens when we get to Vegas . ”
53434	53553	53411	53411	I	191	“ Karas International stock has risen sharply following the news that the shareholder suit against its chief executive officer , Creighton Karas , was dropped earlier this week . Karas commented from the floor of Caesar ’s Palace , where he stood at his wife ’s side during her run on the craps table . ‘ I ’m happy to see that my uncle understands that the health of the company is more important than any grudge he has against me personally . We ’re looking forward to another record - breaking year in profits . ’ There ’s no doubt the world will be watching Karas International , and its CEO , closely in the coming months . ”
53591	53604	53605	53605	Creighton	48	“ Glad they got the part about the craps table in there , ”
53608	53619	53620	53620	I	191	“ And that Dom was as good as his word , ”
53634	53651	53623	53623	Creighton	48	“ Yes , yes he was . Now let ’s get the hell out of here . ”
53948	53959	53979	53979	He	191	“ Are you sure you do n’t want a driver ? ”
53965	53978	53960	53960	I	191	“ You ’re going to lose on this one . I promise . ”
54000	54005	53979	53979	He	191	“ Holly . . . ”
54006	54024	53979	53979	He	191	“ It ’ll be fine . I swear . I ’m just seeing what she can do . ”
54025	54028	53979	53979	He	191	“ She ? ”
54040	54054	54034	54034	I	191	“ Of course it ’s a she . Her name is Cherry Bomb . ”
54064	54073	54055	54055	Creighton	48	“ If you name my cock . . . ”
54079	54086	54074	54074	I	191	“ Who says I have n’t ? ”
54093	54105	54087	54087	His	191	“ You ’re not going to tell me , are you ? ”
54114	54117	54118	54118	I	191	“ Nope , ”
54127	54135	54118	54118	I	191	“ You ’ll just have to wonder . ”
54136	54149	54118	54118	I	191	“ Oh , you ’ll tell me . I have my ways . ”
54443	54463	54464	54464	He	870	“ I was the one who was lost . I just did n’t know it until I found you . ”
54474	54495	54464	54464	He	870	“ I love you so goddamn much , Holly . I never want to go back to being that man . ”
54558	54592	54604	54604	he	171	“ I ’ll never let you go back to being that man , because I ’m never giving you up , Creighton Karas . I love you . You ’re mine . Always . ”
54632	54637	54638	54638	he	171	“ Mine . Always , ”
54641	54652	54638	54638	he	171	“ Now , let ’s go find our new home . ”
54975	54981	54960	54960	She	1176	“ Lost on Fifth Avenue , ”
55171	55188	55164	55164	Her	1176	“ No fucking way on God ’s green Earth will you get another cent from us , ”
55211	55303	55197	55197	Holly	1176	“ Hey , y’ all . Thank you so much for this . I ca n’t even tell you how it feels for a girl from Gold Haven , Kentucky , who used to watch this show on the tiny TV in a singlewide trailer , to be standing on this stage accepting it . Surreal does n’t even begin to cover it . I want to thank my husband , Creighton Karas , a man insane enough to place a missed connection ad looking for a one - night stand . ”
55316	55383	55197	55197	Holly	1176	“ Because his insanity is the best damn thing that ’s ever happened to me . I would ’ve never written the songs on the album without it , and the single that got me your votes would ’ve never come to be if I had n’t met him . I love you , Crey . This is for you . It ’s all for you . ”
55400	55434	55384	55384	She	1176	“ I ’d also like to thank my agent , my manager , and my very own label , Homegrown Records . This past year has been absolutely amazing . Thank you all . ”
55587	55604	55605	55605	She	1176	“ Excuse me . Can you give me a minute ? Oh , and hold this . ”
55722	55734	55764	55764	she	1176	“ I did it ! I really , really did it ! ”
55735	55755	55764	55764	she	1176	“ Yeah , you did , baby . You sure did . Congratulations , Holly . You earned it . ”
55767	55786	55764	55764	she	1176	“ I think you need to get me out of here because I ’m about to ugly cry . ”
55800	55807	55787	55787	My	191	“ Baby , it ’s okay . ”
55825	55844	55808	55808	Holly	1176	“ You need to get that award , and we need to get the hell out of Dodge . ”
55845	55855	55808	55808	Holly	1176	“ You really want me to make our excuses ? ”
55860	55863	55856	55856	She	1176	“ Okay . ”
55880	55892	55864	55864	I	191	“ Thank you . Is there an empty room around here ? ”
55904	55916	55917	55917	He	900	“ Uh . . . uh . . . That way . ”
55926	55943	55917	55917	He	900	“ Around the corner and down the hall . Try the second door on the left . ”
55944	55948	55949	55949	I	191	“ Thank you , ”
55971	55983	55984	55984	I	191	“ Reach out a hand and grab the award , baby , ”
56105	56125	56126	56126	She	1176	“ I ca n’t believe it ’s real . It just does n’t seem like it could be real . ”
56138	56165	56171	56171	she	1176	“ It ’s real . And you earned it . You worked your ass off to get here . It ’s as real as it gets . ”
56177	56193	56171	56171	she	1176	“ As real as it gets ? That ’s what you said about us before . ”
56194	56202	56171	56171	she	1176	“ Yeah , I guess I did . ”
56203	56213	56171	56171	she	1176	“ Took me a while to believe that too . ”
56214	56238	56171	56171	she	1176	“ I have a feeling you ’ll believe this one sooner . After all , you ’ve got the trophy to prove it . ”
56244	56252	56239	56239	She	1176	“ The real prize here is you . ”
56267	56282	56264	56264	I	191	“ We ’re the prize . The absolute best fucking prize of my life . ”
56293	56311	56264	56264	I	191	“ Now , what do you say about a honeymoon before this baby starts running our lives ? ”
56324	56334	56312	56312	Holly	1176	“ A honeymoon ? Where are you taking me ? ”
56335	56340	56312	56312	Holly	1176	“ Does it matter ? ”
56354	56369	56341	56341	She	1176	“ I ’ll go anywhere with you , Mr. Karas . Take me away . ”
