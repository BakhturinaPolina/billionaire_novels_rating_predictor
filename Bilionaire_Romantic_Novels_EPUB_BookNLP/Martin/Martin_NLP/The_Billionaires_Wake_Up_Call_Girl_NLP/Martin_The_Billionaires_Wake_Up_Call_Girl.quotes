435	437	427	428	One woman	262	“ o ”
710	713	714	714	she	711	“ Mmm … ”
738	744	745	745	I	717	“ Is there a problem ? ”
813	827	828	828	I	717	“ The engagement numbers are already better than most of Vossameer ’s peers , ”
840	842	844	845	little beings	269	“ Crickets ”
884	899	871	871	She	711	“ You wanted our site to come up on the first page on Google , ”
904	929	900	900	I	717	“ Now it does , but we ’ll do even better once the new site is up . I think people will stay longer . ”
1404	1406	1398	1399	Mr. Drummond	986	“ amazing ”
1463	1476	1459	1461	Amazing Mr. Drummond	986	“ Mr. Drummond is not the most sociable person in the world , ”
1486	1520	1477	1477	Sasha	711	“ He has extremely high standards — for himself and for his employees — but his amazing breakthroughs save lives every day . The work we do to support him makes that possible . ”
1579	1593	1594	1594	I	717	“ On the next page are the website hits that come from Facebook , ”
1649	1657	1640	1640	She	711	“ Why am I seeing these people ? ”
1658	1688	1689	1689	I	717	“ Well , our marketing materials tend to concentrate on the medical effects of our hemostatic gel , but that ’s not what we ’re selling , is it ? ”
1692	1723	1724	1724	She	711	“ We ’re selling more time with loved ones . We ’re selling health providers the ability to grant more time to wounded patients . That ’s our true product . ”
1749	1758	1759	1759	I	717	“ Look at any hospital or pharma website , ”
1762	1782	1759	1759	I	717	“ Right now , let ’s go look . You ’ll see pictures of happy people living life together . ”
1881	1885	1886	1886	I	717	“ After all , ”
1889	1914	1886	1886	I	717	“ it ’s not as if hospitals are going to fill their sites with pictures of bloody scalpels and ugly surgical scars . Right ? ”
1960	1970	1971	1971	she	711	“ Mr. Drummond wo n’t like seeing all this , ”
1980	1989	1971	1971	she	711	“ He wo n’t like it at all . ”
2013	2021	2022	2022	I	717	“ Why wo n’t he like it ? ”
2036	2059	2060	2060	I	717	“ The thing is , my assignment was to modernize and humanize Vossameer ’s online presence … and people relate to people , ”
2135	2148	2149	2149	she	301	“ No , you probably have a point . About the people , ”
2152	2161	2149	2149	she	301	“ It ’s social media , after all . ”
2162	2167	2168	2168	I	717	“ Yeah , right ? ”
2172	2183	2184	2184	She	301	“ Mr. Drummond does want this foundation partnership . But … ”
2245	2248	2249	2249	Sasha	711	“ Welp ! ”
2253	2263	2249	2249	Sasha	711	“ Who knows , maybe he ’ll like it . ”
2273	2305	2264	2264	Her	711	“ Mr. Drummond sees things we do n’t , does things for reasons we do n’t always understand . It ’s amazing he ’s as patient with us as he is . ”
2306	2311	2312	2312	I	717	“ Sure , okay , ”
2315	2324	2325	2325	she	711	“ I ’ll have you present with me , ”
2328	2336	2325	2325	she	711	“ We ’ll head up after lunch . ”
2337	2342	2343	2343	I	717	“ Wait — what ? ”
2363	2370	2325	2325	she	711	“ You ’ll help me explain . ”
2371	2381	2382	2382	I	717	“ I thought you liked to present … solo . ”
2412	2418	2419	2419	She	711	“ You ’re the expert . ”
2528	2533	2534	2534	She	711	“ It ’s fine . ”
2539	2545	2534	2534	She	711	“ See you at 1:45 . ”
2660	2664	2657	2658	Britney Spears	81	“ Gimme More . ”
2735	2746	2725	2725	Sasha	711	“ Do not speak unless spoken to . You understand ? ”
2747	2751	2752	2752	I	717	“ Got it , ”
2755	2761	2762	2762	she	711	“ Do n’t elaborate needlessly , ”
2765	2771	2772	2772	I	717	“ You tend to elaborate … ”
2775	2782	2772	2772	I	717	“ Got it . No elaboration . ”
2870	2880	2881	2881	she	711	“ Not everybody gets the chance to meet him , ”
3552	3559	3560	3560	she	711	“ Do n’t mess this up , ”
3563	3567	3560	3560	she	711	“ No worries ! ”
3574	3580	3581	3581	Sasha	711	“ I got your back . ”
3819	3825	3826	3826	she	356	“ He ’s expecting you , ”
3858	3861	3862	3862	I	717	“ Thanks , ”
4078	4086	4093	4093	he	986	“ Lab Coat and Eye Protection Required . ”
4104	4114	4115	4115	I	717	“ Looks like Mr. Amazing is being amazing elsewhere , ”
4118	4123	4124	4124	Sasha	711	“ What ’s that ? ”
4127	4134	4135	4135	I	717	“ Looks like he ’s elsewhere , ”
4445	4461	4462	4462	Sasha	711	“ We have the social media and site makeover presentation for you , Mr. Drummond , ”
4465	4470	4471	4471	He	986	“ For your perusal . ”
4486	4496	4497	4497	he	986	“ Do we have an appointment of some sort ? ”
4509	4512	4513	4513	Sasha	711	“ Yes , ”
4526	4531	4516	4516	He	986	“ And you are … ”
4532	4541	4516	4516	He	986	“ This is Elizabeth Cooper . New assistant . ”
4542	4548	4549	4549	I	717	“ Pleased to meet you . ”
4579	4594	4595	4595	He	986	“ Let ’s have it , then . We ’ll set up over there . ”
4820	4826	4827	4827	Sasha	711	“ Helping to save lives . ”
4843	4847	4848	4849	Mr. Drummond	986	“ medical antihemorrhagics . ”
4873	4876	4864	4864	he	986	“ No . ”
4898	4910	4883	4883	she	711	“ You ’ll need to get rid of that , Lizzie . ”
4911	4915	4916	4916	I	717	“ No problem , ”
5218	5226	5227	5228	Mr. Drummond	986	“ What are these images of picnics ? ”
5231	5252	5253	5253	Sasha	711	“ How is that relevant to anything ? I ’m running a pharmaceutical gel business , not a Six Flags . ”
5258	5261	5253	5253	Sasha	711	“ Lizzie ? ”
5330	5342	5343	5343	I	717	“ People do n’t care about what ’s on their bandages , ”
5346	5359	5343	5343	I	717	“ It ’s not the quality of Vossameer gel they care about — ”
5360	5366	5367	5368	Mr. Drummond	986	“ What do you mean ? ”
5373	5381	5367	5368	Mr. Drummond	986	“ Of course they care about quality . ”
5382	5385	5386	5386	I	717	“ No , ”
5396	5428	5386	5386	I	717	“ They care about another chance to be happy , to share meals with their favorite people , to watch them grow . To celebrate together . Lean on each other … ”
5470	5474	5475	5475	I	717	“ So actually , ”
5478	5514	5475	5475	I	717	“ these pictures are relevant . Because we ’re not selling hemostatic gel . We ’re selling another day . We ’re selling possibilities . And giving medical personnel the power to deliver on that . ”
5523	5535	5536	5536	I	717	“ It ’s how all other medical solutions companies position themselves , ”
5553	5567	5568	5568	I	717	“ Do I look like I care what other medical companies are doing ? ”
5571	5574	5568	5568	I	717	“ Okay . ”
5575	5581	5582	5582	he	986	“ It ’s a question , ”
5585	5589	5582	5582	he	986	“ Do I ? ”
5616	5623	5610	5610	I	717	“ I suppose you do n’t . ”
5624	5652	5653	5653	He	986	“ You suppose right . I do n’t care what other companies are doing . And all of this … children and their teddy bears and whatnot … ”
5672	5686	5653	5653	He	986	“ it has no place on our website or our feeds or whatever ... ”
5687	5697	5698	5698	Sasha	711	“ That ’s what I ’ve been telling her , ”
5701	5714	5715	5715	I	717	“ Families do n’t belong on our site or on our feeds . ”
5726	5740	5715	5715	I	717	“ How about medical personnel ? Or could we maybe spotlight the chemists ? ”
5793	5801	5777	5777	They	386	“ We could have them talk about — ”
5802	5814	5815	5816	Mr. Drummond	986	“ How about achieving our goals without a lot of fluff ? ”
5885	5896	5897	5897	He	986	“ Social media , too ? No images of people ? ”
5903	5919	5897	5897	He	986	“ Okay , so the assignment is to modernize and humanize Vossameer ’s online presence , ”
5927	5944	5920	5920	I	717	“ and I hear you saying , let ’s do that without using any humans whatsoever . ”
5982	5989	5977	5977	He	986	“ Very good , Mr. Drummond , ”
6010	6019	6020	6020	he	986	“ So do we have everything under control ? ”
6038	6041	6031	6031	I	717	“ Absolutely . ”
6042	6046	6047	6047	Sasha	711	“ Of course , ”
6050	6059	6060	6060	We	388	“ I ’ll help her figure it out . ”
6086	6092	6093	6093	she	711	“ You were a disaster , ”
6096	6117	6118	6118	I	717	“ The way you contradicted him on everything . I had to pull it out of the fire for you . ”
6136	6139	6140	6140	I	717	“ Well , ”
6143	6159	6140	6140	I	717	“ we have a strong new direction to work with . So that ’s good . ”
6160	6168	6140	6140	I	717	“ Those images . I told you … ”
6169	6174	6175	6175	I	717	“ Consider them pulled , ”
6178	6198	6175	6175	I	717	“ And your outfit . It was highly distracting to Mr. Drummond . The employee handbook forbids revealing outfits . ”
6228	6236	6237	6237	she	391	“ It ’s distractingly formfitting as well , ”
6240	6251	6237	6237	she	391	“ This is a workplace , not a fashion show . ”
6334	6341	6342	6342	I	717	“ I ’ll keep it appropriate , ”
6398	6416	6417	6417	she	391	“ Even so , I ’m going to have to write you up for inappropriate workplace attire , ”
6420	6423	6417	6417	she	391	“ What ? ”
6448	6454	6440	6440	I	717	“ I did n’t think … ”
6455	6460	6461	6461	she	391	“ Now you will , ”
6495	6499	6500	6500	I	717	“ No way , ”
6503	6515	6500	6500	I	717	“ I ’m trying to appease her , not mock her . ”
6516	6527	6528	6528	she	391	“ Come on . She ’ll see you ’re trying , ”
6531	6546	6547	6547	I	717	“ This is what she wants . She wants for you to become invisible . ”
6562	6580	6581	6581	I	717	“ This is a code red alarm . We need serious ugly firepower to hide your hotness . ”
6606	6628	6597	6597	she	391	“ I ’m going for invisible , not , ‘ Look at me ! I ’m having a psychotic break ! ’ ”
6629	6645	6646	6646	I	717	“ Do you want to keep the job or not ? Go try it on . ”
6676	6685	6686	6686	I	717	“ I better not see this on Instagram , ”
6689	6701	6686	6686	I	717	“ Are you kidding ? This is why they invented Instagram . ”
6801	6806	6807	6807	Mia	92	“ Oh my god ! ”
6817	6825	6807	6807	Mia	92	“ It ’s perfect . So sad . ”
6826	6836	6837	6837	She	92	“ You ’re such a good friend to me . ”
6848	6866	6837	6837	She	92	“ I ’m not walking into a Manhattan office building wearing Crocs . It ’s not happening . ”
6867	6875	6876	6876	She	92	“ Fine . Do n’t wear them . ”
6895	6909	6876	6876	She	92	“ You look like you ’re in a religious survivalist sect or something . ”
6910	6913	6914	6914	She	92	“ Yay ? ”
6921	6931	6932	6932	she	92	“ There ’s still your face to contend with , ”
6935	6943	6932	6932	she	92	“ Your face is still a problem . ”
6944	6955	6968	6968	she	92	“ I already do n’t like where this is going . ”
6956	6967	6968	6968	she	92	“ Nah , you just need a little acting instruction , ”
6971	6978	6968	6968	she	92	“ Think of your favorite snack … ”
6979	6985	6986	6986	I	717	“ Cookies that I frost , ”
6990	6997	6986	6986	I	717	“ That ’s my favorite snack . ”
6998	7036	7037	7037	I	717	“ No , no , a different snack . Cookies remind you of the bakery and the bakery makes you sad . You like every kind of candy . How about gummy bears ? You love those . ”
7052	7075	7040	7040	I	717	“ I want you to picture gummy bears . Show on your face how you feel about gummy bears . Right now . ”
7083	7100	7101	7101	I	717	“ Okay , pull it back a little . You do n’t love them that much . ”
7106	7117	7118	7118	she	406	“ There ! Now I want you to add something , ”
7121	7151	7118	7118	she	406	“ Think of gummy bears while looking at my nose . Never my eyes , just my nose . It ’ll make you seem distant and a little stupid . ”
7152	7177	7178	7178	Mia	92	“ Wow , Mia , if you decide to quit your day gig , you could try for a career as a makeover expert . ”
7218	7228	7229	7229	She	92	“ It ’s totally effective . Check it out . ”
7241	7254	7229	7229	She	92	“ Do n’t I seem dull now ? Who even does this ? ”
7255	7268	7269	7269	I	717	“ Oh my god ! It ’s like you ’re barely there ! ”
7295	7335	7290	7290	Mia	92	“ You must avoid looking into his eyes at all times , just in case your pupils grow large and Sasha picks up on it as a sign of sexual attraction . Or worse , if Mr. Drummond does . ”
7336	7349	7350	7350	I	717	“ I am not and will not be attracted to that asshole , ”
7353	7361	7350	7350	I	717	“ You did say he was gorgeous . ”
7362	7399	7290	7290	Mia	92	“ That does n’t mean I ’m sexually attracted to him . I think the Taj Mahal is gorgeous , but I ’m not going to stand in front of a picture of it and masturbate . ”
7400	7410	7290	7290	Mia	92	“ Okay , now , that ’s just disturbing . ”
7411	7420	7421	7421	I	717	“ I ’m seriously not attracted to him , ”
7438	7487	7488	7488	We	412	“ I ’m off guys , and if for some bizarre reason I wanted a new relationship , it would not be with somebody who ’s more of a controlling asshole than Mason ever was . And what a jerk ! Keep your eyes to yourself , jackass ! ”
7557	7607	7716	7716	she	92	“ From now on , if you ever have contact with Mr. Drummond , you must do the opposite of what you did before . For example , you guys had that conflict about photos and you told him why he was wrong , right ? You challenged him . ”
7608	7618	7619	7619	I	717	“ Yeah , but I was nice about it , ”
7622	7626	7619	7619	I	717	“ Unlike him . ”
7627	7681	7682	7682	I	717	“ Still , you challenged him , and a guy like that is n’t used to being challenged , so it made you stand out , because clearly everyone there kisses his ass . So if you interact with him again , you have to act impressed . Like he ’s so amazing . ”
7685	7689	7690	7690	Mia	92	“ Hold up . ”
7706	7715	7716	7716	she	92	“ I know it ’s hard for you , ”
7737	7741	7725	7725	She	92	“ You like ? ”
7742	7748	7749	7749	I	717	“ Way too Kate Middleton , ”
7764	7774	7775	7775	I	717	“ Kylie Jenner . No , no , no . ”
7786	7825	7775	7775	I	717	“ I do n’t know if I have it in me to kiss Mr. Drummond ’s ass . It ’s a lot harder than wearing an ugly dress . I do n’t know if I can do it . ”
7826	7855	7752	7752	She	92	“ I know , but just remind yourself he ’s not Mason . He ’s controlling and jerky like Mason , but he is not Mason , okay ? ”
7856	7859	7775	7775	I	717	“ Okay . ”
7860	7899	7775	7775	I	717	“ You will act impressed and amazed whenever he comes around . You just have to last tomorrow , you get the weekend to rest , and then it ’s one more week . You can do it . ”
7900	7909	7752	7752	She	92	“ I do n’t know if I can . ”
7910	7914	7915	7915	She	419	“ You can . ”
7930	7937	7938	7938	I	717	“ We ’re in this together . ”
7943	7953	7938	7938	I	717	“ It hugely helps that you would say that . ”
7954	7985	7986	7986	I	717	“ I ’m always with you . Even when you move back to Fargo . I ’ll be the devil on your shoulder telling you to have that extra dessert . ”
7989	7998	7999	7999	she	419	“ But I think you wo n’t move , ”
8002	8028	7999	7999	she	419	“ I think you ’ll find a gorgeous , dirt - cheap space to rent for your new bakery that you ca n’t pass up . ”
8035	8056	8029	8029	I	717	“ A gorgeous , dirt - cheap place that they are dying to rent to me with my shitty credit . ”
8057	8066	8074	8074	I	717	“ There are still lucky finds out there . ”
8067	8073	8074	8074	I	717	“ Not in this city , ”
8158	8174	8175	8175	I	717	“ Do n’t worry , though . I ’ll get you such a good subletter , ”
8178	8205	8175	8175	I	717	“ I ’m going to find somebody with a boyfriend or girlfriend who has their own place . And eighteen months later , boo - yah . ”
8206	8217	8218	8218	she	427	“ Friends do n’t let friends say boo - yah , ”
8228	8239	8240	8240	she	427	“ I wonder what Mr. Drummond ’s like in bed , ”
8243	8256	8240	8240	she	427	“ Is he just as much of a control freak in bed ? ”
8257	8296	8240	8240	she	427	“ Oh my god ! Is this a good question to be asking me ? Is this what I want in my mind as I struggle to gaze at his nose while channeling my love of gummy bears ? ”
8297	8306	8240	8240	she	427	“ You know you ’ve been wondering it . ”
8307	8322	8323	8323	I	717	“ He ’s probably a deadbeat . His most effusive praise is a grunt , ”
8326	8333	8334	8334	She	427	“ What does that tell you ? ”
8348	8355	8345	8345	she	427	“ It tells me , caveman . ”
8356	8373	8374	8374	I	717	“ Fuck the fuck off ! Seriously ? That ’s what you put in my head ? ”
8377	8386	8374	8374	I	717	“ How can I control my pupils now ? ”
8452	8455	8440	8440	Holly	98	“ room scan ”
8961	8971	8948	8948	He	444	“ Are you literally threatening us with a gun ? ”
8975	8984	8985	8985	He	444	“ What the hell does it look like ? ”
8997	9020	8993	8993	I	717	“ You ’ll bring Lenny six thousand dollars to Carson ’s on Third Ave in Murray Hill or this shit gets serious . ”
9021	9024	9025	9025	I	717	“ Please , ”
9031	9044	9025	9025	I	717	“ First installment , six thousand . Carson ’s . Got it . ”
9141	9146	9147	9147	she	511	“ Lenny ? Seriously ? ”
9155	9164	9147	9147	she	511	“ Can that be more of a cliché ? ”
9165	9169	9170	9170	I	717	“ I know ! ”
9949	9952	9953	9953	Sasha	711	“ Okay , ”
9956	9965	9953	9953	Sasha	711	“ Everyone ’s finally present and accounted for . ”
9986	9995	9996	9996	he	986	“ I ’ve been reading up on things , ”
9999	10015	9996	9996	he	986	“ I wanted to do an Instagram strategy . What do you think about it ? ”
10107	10110	10111	10111	Sasha	711	“ Opinions ? ”
10162	10182	10183	10183	he	103	“ That ’s something we should definitely be looking into vis - à - vis the Locke Foundation partnership , ”
10311	10315	10308	10308	He	483	“ go to school ”
10367	10385	10358	10358	I	717	“ Excellent idea . We should look into it and make a proposal . Could be amazing . ”
12154	12160	12161	12161	I	717	“ Thank you , then , ”
12164	12176	12161	12161	I	717	“ Write it up and … make a proposal to me . ”
12198	12204	12195	12195	she	107	“ A few quick questions . ”
12205	12210	12211	12211	I	717	“ Walk and talk . ”
12222	12235	12236	12236	I	717	“ The new one ’s a little quiet , is n’t she ? ”
12248	12254	12255	12255	she	107	“ Lizzie ? Ms. Cooper ? ”
12258	12265	12255	12255	she	107	“ The one I presented with ? ”
12266	12269	12270	12270	I	717	“ Yeah , ”
12273	12284	12285	12285	Sasha	711	“ She ’s a little incompetent , I ’m afraid , ”
12293	12301	12302	12302	She	107	“ She tries , but she ’s … ”
12308	12350	12302	12302	She	107	“ I ’ve already given her two write - ups . She wo n’t last through probation . I hate to say this , but she ’s a bit of a moron . Slow - witted . Why do you ask ? ”
12351	12355	12356	12356	I	717	“ Just wondering . ”
12368	12374	12356	12356	I	717	“ You had a question ? ”
12375	12385	12386	12386	she	107	“ Yes . Do you have a due date ? ”
12389	12394	12395	12395	I	717	“ For the Instagram ? ”
12485	12493	12494	12494	I	717	“ What ’s a reasonable due date ? ”
12500	12549	12494	12494	I	717	“ It depends . I ’m thinking we could work up a creative brief and strategy , but if you want the proposal to contain a budget , that might add time . We ’d need a set of measurable goals and a timeframe to get the budget . ”
12574	12587	12569	12569	I	717	“ What would you recommend ? How would you prefer to proceed ? ”
12588	12613	12644	12644	She	107	“ Let ’s do goals and strategy by the end of the month . Once that ’s approved , we ’ll establish a budget . ”
12619	12624	12625	12625	I	717	“ Make it so . ”
12638	12643	12644	12644	She	107	“ One more assignment . ”
12649	12652	12644	12644	She	107	“ Yes ? ”
12653	12660	12661	12661	Sasha	711	“ My receptionist is out today … ”
12665	12677	12661	12661	Sasha	711	“ I heard about that . She ’ll be a grandmother . ”
12678	12681	12644	12644	She	107	“ Yes . ”
12689	12699	12644	12644	She	107	“ You need someone … to office up there ? ”
12700	12707	12661	12661	Sasha	711	“ No , I ’m fine . ”
12738	12762	12763	12763	I	717	“ My wake - up - call service is no longer viable . Do you think you could arrange for a new one ? ”
12774	12843	12844	12844	She	529	“ This is not to be used for any other purpose . Have a wake - up call placed to me at 4:30 in the morning , every weekday morning , starting Monday . If I do n’t answer , it ’s to repeat . If I answer and hang up , it ’s to repeat . They need to make sure I ’m awake . You understand ? ”
12847	12851	12844	12844	She	529	“ Thank you . ”
12866	12889	12853	12854	Lizzie Sasha	511	“ Do you realize you did n’t make eye contact with Mr. Drummond once today ? Do you think that ’s polite ? ”
12890	12894	12909	12909	she	529	“ Excuse me ? ”
12895	12908	12909	12909	she	529	“ He was wondering why you would n’t even look at him , ”
12912	12923	12909	12909	she	529	“ What was that ? Some kind of elusiveness game ? ”
12945	12955	12939	12940	the man	530	“ I was trying to be non - distracting . ”
12956	12995	12996	12996	I	717	“ You think that was non - distracting ? To so pointedly ignore him when he was speaking to you ? This is a workplace , not a forum for testing out strategies best left to singles bars . ”
13178	13213	13173	13173	God	111	“ I want you to attempt to write up a credible Instagram strategy . Let ’s see what you ’ve got . Propose a reasonable set of goals and a strategy to get there . ”
13238	13282	13226	13226	I	717	“ Can we use stories of real - life people who were helped by the products ? With the details changed , of course . But instead of people pictures , we could have images like a bicycle if they were a biker … ”
13289	13313	13226	13226	I	717	“ And run afoul of medical - records privacy laws ? Does that sound like the kind of marketing Mr. Drummond would appreciate ? ”
13314	13318	13319	13319	I	717	“ Guess not , ”
13323	13331	13332	13332	I	717	“ Wait , I have an idea , ”
13335	13434	13332	13332	I	717	“ We do two directions — one that ’s on the passion of employees here , and maybe even a work - journal blog - type thing on a breakthrough . Even better — you know how Mr. Drummond ’s working on that new thing ? We could send a junior chemist up to take notes on his progress , and get shots of beakers and things , and it would be like an exciting race to find a cure . I bet Mr. Drummond would love that — he ’s so focused on his formulas , right ? ”
13435	13438	13439	13439	Sasha	511	“ Hmm . ”
13444	13464	13439	13439	Sasha	511	“ And then a third direction — a rationale on why Instagram is a waste of money for Vossameer . ”
13465	13471	13332	13332	I	717	“ He asked for Instagram . ”
13472	13506	13507	13507	She	511	“ I think he ’d appreciate it if we evaluated it critically instead of just saying yes . ‘ Why Instagram is wrong for Vossameer . ’ I bet he ’d love it . ”
13536	13562	13563	13563	I	717	“ Work it all up , and I ’ll decide how I feel about it . End of next week . Can you do it ? ”
13618	13627	13628	13628	I	717	“ I will make this Instagram proposal amazing , ”
13638	13649	13650	13650	She	511	“ See that you do . Oh , and this . ”
13686	13727	13631	13631	She	511	“ You ’re to arrange a wake - up - call service for Mr. Drummond for 4:30 in the morning , every weekday morning . Do n’t screw it up . He ’s very particular about managing his sleep patterns . ”
13728	13741	13650	13650	She	511	“ Is there a recommended company resource for wake - up calls ? ”
13742	13764	13631	13631	She	511	“ If there were , I would n’t be tasking you with it . Find a service on Craigslist or something . ”
13765	13768	13631	13631	She	511	“ Okay . ”
13769	13784	13650	13650	She	511	“ Arrange the first one for 4:30 Monday morning . Can you handle that ? ”
13785	13789	13790	13790	I	717	“ Got it . ”
14150	14163	14164	14164	I	717	“ What do you mean ? We ’re good for the money , ”
14167	14190	14164	14164	I	717	“ We ’ll send cash if it comes to it . We ’ll send Canadian dollars through the mail if you want . ”
14191	14199	14200	14200	she	543	“ I just have to clear it , ”
14203	14211	14200	14200	she	543	“ I ’m sure it ’s fine . ”
14212	14221	14233	14233	she	543	“ When will I know it ’s cleared ? ”
14222	14232	14233	14233	she	543	“ I ’m sure it ’s fine as is , ”
14236	14243	14233	14233	she	543	“ You ’re on the docket . ”
14489	14492	14481	14481	I	717	“ Damn , ”
14496	14501	14493	14493	I	717	“ damn damn damn . ”
14551	14562	14540	14540	I	717	“ They did n’t come through ? With the call ? ”
14563	14568	14569	14569	I	717	“ I ’m sorry , ”
14572	14581	14569	14569	I	717	“ I did n’t mean to wake you . ”
14582	14591	14592	14592	She	511	“ I think it was the coffee smell . ”
14600	14614	14615	14615	She	511	“ It ’s okay . I have to memorize a scene for tonight . ”
14618	14627	14615	14615	She	511	“ You did n’t get your test call ? ”
14628	14631	14632	14632	I	717	“ No , ”
14644	14650	14635	14635	She	511	“ You have to call . ”
14651	14686	14687	14687	I	717	“ He ’d figure out it was me , and Sasha is looking for a reason to fire me . Anyway , I do n’t even know what a wake - up call says . ”
14714	14719	14708	14709	Mr. Drummond	986	“ I ca n’t . ”
14720	14727	14728	14728	Mia	92	“ This is not rocket science , ”
14731	14738	14739	14739	She	511	“ He just needs a call . ”
14748	14751	14739	14739	She	511	“ Ringing . ”
14798	14803	14804	14804	Mia	92	“ Yes , hello , ”
14816	14825	14804	14804	Mia	92	“ This is your wake - up call … ”
14853	14859	14860	14860	I	717	“ Wake up , motherfucker , ”
14863	14874	14860	14860	I	717	“ It ’s time to rise and shine , okay ? ”
14896	14935	14892	14892	I	717	“ It ’s another day , full of promise and possibility , another opportunity for you to step over whatever people you step over on your way to wherever the hell you go at this weirdly stupid hour . ”
14947	15025	14941	14941	I	717	“ Time to start your day of being a complete and utter asshole , a man who thinks he ’s all that and totally is n’t . And you need a wake - up call because you ’re sooooo special . Because for whatever reason , you ’re too much of an asshole to work an alarm clock like ninety - nine - point - nine - nine - nine percent of people are able to do . ”
15055	15060	15047	15047	She	92	“ Oh , wait . ”
15073	15099	15061	15061	I	717	“ I ’m sorry . You ’re such an important person . I mean , oh my god ! The whole world shivers in admiration . ”
15115	15142	15110	15110	she	92	“ The birds fall from the trees when you approach , stunned by your glory . Everybody ca n’t wait for you and your enchanting thoughts . ”
15150	15153	15143	15143	I	717	“ Not . ”
15160	15163	15143	15143	I	717	“ What ? ”
15219	15222	15223	15224	Mr. Drummond	986	“ Hello ? ”
15252	15260	15261	15261	Mia	92	“ Omigod , I ’m so sorry ! ”
15266	15277	15278	15278	She	92	“ I ’m so sorry . Omigod , I thought … ”
15286	15290	15291	15291	I	717	“ I know , ”
15295	15300	15291	15291	I	717	“ It ’s okay . ”
15301	15307	15308	15308	she	92	“ It ’s not okay , ”
15311	15317	15308	15308	she	92	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
15318	15339	15340	15340	Riiiing	116	“ I should ’ve checked it . You were just trying to help . It was my mistake , my — ”
15373	15378	15367	15367	I	717	“ Do n’t answer . ”
15379	15385	15386	15386	Mia	92	“ Furthest from my mind , ”
15393	15404	15405	15405	she	92	“ Please tell me you have generic voicemail on there , ”
15408	15411	15412	15412	I	717	“ Yes , ”
15419	15436	15412	15412	I	717	“ It ’s a burner . No name . It just says to leave a message . ”
15450	15475	15412	15412	I	717	“ Good . And when you call me with that one , it comes up NY Cell . It does n’t have your name . ”
15486	15517	15480	15480	Mia	92	“ You have n’t taken your allergy medicine yet today . Your voice sounds husky . He probably never heard your voice sound like that . He wo n’t know ! ”
15518	15525	15526	15526	I	717	“ Of course he ’ll know , ”
15529	15536	15526	15526	I	717	“ Once he complains to Sasha . ”
15537	15550	15480	15480	Mia	92	“ Tell her you did n’t know they ’d be like that . ”
15551	15582	15583	15583	I	717	“ What wake - up - call service says things like that ? They ’re going to figure out it was me , and Sasha is going to fire me . ”
15599	15607	15591	15591	Mia	92	“ I ’m so so so sorry . ”
15608	15614	15615	15615	I	717	“ It was an accident , ”
15621	15634	15615	15615	I	717	“ We ’ll figure it out . If you lose that bonus — ”
15635	15642	15591	15591	Mia	92	“ When I lose the bonus . ”
15643	15653	15591	15591	Mia	92	“ I ’ll help you raise what you need . ”
15654	15661	15662	15662	I	717	“ I need fourteen thousand dollars , ”
15665	15676	15677	15677	she	92	“ I ’ll prostitute myself down on Thirty - eighth , ”
15680	15684	15685	15685	I	717	“ Stop it , ”
15688	15699	15685	15685	I	717	“ You ’re not going down to Thirty - eighth . ”
15720	15729	15730	15730	I	717	“ I ’ll wear my green feather boa . ”
15737	15756	15757	15757	She	92	“ I guess if I had to go … saying all those things did feel kind of amazing . ”
15762	15768	15757	15757	She	92	“ There ’s the spirit . ”
15769	15777	15778	15778	She	92	“ Though possibly not worth my kneecaps . ”
15783	15790	15791	15791	she	92	“ Blow jobs for a buck , ”
15794	15801	15791	15791	she	92	“ See ? I got this . ”
15802	15807	15808	15808	I	717	“ Do n’t even . ”
15855	15861	15874	15874	she	92	“ Nobody ’s prostituting themselves . ”
15862	15873	15874	15874	she	92	“ Let me at least take you out for breakfast , ”
15877	15894	15874	15874	she	92	“ We ’ll get hash browns with hollandaise sauce and eggs on top . And mimosas . ”
15916	15929	15900	15900	I	717	“ Why ? Because I ’ll be sleeping with the fishes soon ? ”
15930	15936	15900	15900	I	717	“ Seriously . Come on . ”
15937	15947	15948	15948	I	717	“ No , I ’m going in to work , ”
15951	15963	15964	15964	She	92	“ I ’m not fired yet . Maybe if I explained . ”
15974	15983	15967	15967	She	92	“ What if I explained to Mr. Drummond ? ”
15984	15989	15900	15900	I	717	“ Are you joking ? ”
15990	16001	15900	15900	I	717	“ I could make it into a funny story maybe . ”
16002	16018	16019	16019	she	92	“ It does n’t sound like Mr. Drummond has much of a sense of humor , ”
16022	16030	15900	15900	I	717	“ Trust me , he does n’t . ”
16031	16039	16040	16040	Mia	92	“ Tell him it was your roomie , ”
16043	16058	16040	16040	Mia	92	“ Blame it on me . It ’s not like he can fire me . ”
16059	16101	16115	16115	she	92	“ It would n’t work . He would n’t care . No , I ’ll just tell the truth . I ’ll say we were messing around . Surely there have been times in his life when he ’s messed around . ”
16102	16114	16115	16115	she	92	“ We were demonstrating to each other what not to say , ”
16118	16138	16115	16115	she	92	“ Dude , he ’s a millionaire chemist . I doubt he ’ll go for an explanation like that . ”
16139	16151	16152	16152	Mia	92	“ Well , bottom line , we ’re in this together . ”
16549	16553	16554	16554	I	717	“ Good morning , ”
16563	16566	16567	16567	She	511	“ Morning . ”
16755	16760	16746	16746	She	511	“ Leaving so soon ? ”
16790	16793	16794	16794	I	717	“ BRB , ”
16797	16800	16801	16801	she	511	“ Wait , ”
16804	16816	16817	16817	She	511	“ We need to go over the site map with IT . ”
16823	16830	16831	16831	I	717	“ Does eleven work for you ? ”
16837	16851	16831	16831	I	717	“ Yeah . I do n’t have anything set in stone right then . ”
16882	16887	16879	16880	Mr. Drummond	986	“ Hi … uh … ”
16908	16917	16895	16895	He	986	“ Sasha , do you have a moment ? ”
16961	16965	16966	16966	she	511	“ Mr. Drummond ! ”
16969	16973	16966	16966	she	511	“ Of course . ”
17023	17034	17035	17035	he	986	“ The wake - up - call service you arranged , ”
17038	17041	17042	17042	she	511	“ Yes ? ”
17081	17091	17092	17092	Sasha	511	“ So , you guys , a funny story — ”
17099	17112	17092	17092	Sasha	511	“ Excuse me ? Mr. Drummond ’s in the middle of speaking . ”
17113	17122	17123	17123	I	717	“ I just think I should tell you — ”
17150	17168	17144	17144	He	986	“ Was there anything unusual about the way they advertised ? The way they described their service ? ”
17183	17189	17178	17178	Sasha	511	“ Why do you ask ? ”
17205	17209	17210	17210	He	986	“ It was … ”
17220	17228	17210	17210	He	986	“ … unorthodox . I was curious … ”
17256	17263	17264	17264	she	511	“ Nothing out of the ordinary , ”
17267	17281	17282	17282	He	986	“ One wake - up service does n’t tend to differ from another . ”
17303	17311	17312	17312	Sasha	511	“ Is there a problem with it ? ”
17315	17326	17312	17312	Sasha	511	“ Should we get rid of it and find another ? ”
17327	17330	17331	17331	he	986	“ No ! ”
17335	17346	17331	17331	he	986	“ Leave it . This service will do for now . ”
17372	17376	17377	17377	He	986	“ Carry on . ”
17397	17404	17405	17405	I	717	“ Finally you did something right . ”
17408	17416	17405	17405	I	717	“ I ’m glad it worked out . ”
17425	17440	17405	17405	I	717	“ What ’s the deal ? Did you get it off Craigslist or what ? ”
17441	17448	17449	17449	I	717	“ That ’s what you requested , ”
17452	17459	17449	17449	I	717	“ Does it have a name ? ”
17460	17478	17405	17405	I	717	“ Um … I’d have to check . Something really generic . They seemed … competent enough . ”
17479	17494	17495	17495	I	717	“ In an unorthodox way ? Do you know what ’s unorthodox about them ? ”
17503	17513	17500	17500	She	511	“ You do n’t know much , do you ? ”
17514	17522	17523	17523	She	511	“ You want me to research it ? ”
17535	17564	17523	17523	She	511	“ No , we need to keep the site on track . Get me the deets on the wake - up service after you complete your other duties . ”
17937	17943	17929	17929	Thai	127	“ What ’s the occasion ? ”
17952	17982	17983	17983	I	717	“ I was planning it this morning as a consolation feast . But now it ’s a what - the - fuck celebration . Because , what the fuck ! ”
17986	17991	17983	17983	I	717	“ Can you even ? ”
17992	17996	17997	17997	I	717	“ Not even ! ”
18052	18056	18034	18034	she	92	“ For you . ”
18080	18089	18090	18090	She	92	“ Oh , Mia . I love it ! ”
18095	18122	18090	18090	She	92	“ It ’s almost done . And then I ’m going to frame it . And then you can have it . To always look at . ”
18176	18182	18159	18159	I	717	“ Did you nearly faint ? ”
18183	18188	18189	18189	I	717	“ Rrmm - hmm , ”
18198	18201	18202	18202	she	92	“ Unorthodox , ”
18205	18210	18211	18211	I	717	“ Four more days , ”
18214	18220	18211	18211	I	717	“ I can do this . ”
18221	18232	18233	18233	she	92	“ Are you ready to do a repeat performance tonight ? ”
18236	18247	18211	18211	I	717	“ What ? Of the call ? Are you kidding ? ”
18248	18253	18254	18254	she	92	“ You have to , ”
18257	18261	18262	18262	I	717	“ No way , ”
18274	18339	18262	18262	I	717	“ I was thinking about saying they quit on me and I ’ll get Karin to just do it for the next four days , just do a normal wake - up call . Just get me through to the bonus . Though she can stay on if she wants . She might like it as a side gig . She needs the money . ”
18340	18352	18384	18384	Mia	92	“ Wait , what ? You ca n’t quit the calls ! ”
18353	18383	18384	18384	Mia	92	“ Why ? Karin needs the money . If she wo n’t do it , somebody else will . I should ’ve thought of it in the first place . ”
18410	18427	18428	18428	Mia	92	“ You ca n’t just say the mean wake - up service quit after one day , ”
18431	18445	18428	18428	Mia	92	“ Why not ? I ca n’t help it if they ’re flakey . ”
18446	18469	18476	18476	I	717	“ Do n’t rock the boat . He liked the mean wake - up call . You have to do it again . ”
18470	18475	18476	18476	I	717	“ I ca n’t , ”
18479	18485	18476	18476	I	717	“ I just could n’t . ”
18486	18493	18428	18428	Mia	92	“ You said it felt amazing . ”
18494	18507	18428	18428	Mia	92	“ But I did n’t know I was actually talking to him . ”
18508	18528	18476	18476	I	717	“ Set your alarm for four and think about what a jerk he is . How controlling he is . ”
18529	18534	18535	18535	I	717	“ He is that . ”
18544	18567	18568	18568	She	600	“ His employees work so hard , and he does n’t care . He wo n’t even let us have microwave popcorn . ”
18608	18623	18624	18624	she	600	“ Microwave popcorn is one of the main sources of office - worker pleasure , ”
18627	18661	18624	18624	she	600	“ I know , right ? He wants us to be machines like him . He leads by fear . Dude , have you heard of twentieth - century leadership techniques ? Seriously . ”
18662	18670	18671	18671	Mia	92	“ See ? That ’s the spirit . ”
18678	18693	18671	18671	Mia	92	“ You just have to replay this whole conversation at four in the morning . ”
18694	18700	18701	18701	I	717	“ I do n’t know , ”
18722	18744	18709	18709	his	717	“ You get to vent to your asshole boss . Do you know how many people would kill for that opportunity ? ”
18745	18762	18671	18671	Mia	92	“ It ’s risky . What if he figures out I ’m somebody from the office ? ”
18763	18785	18709	18709	his	717	“ Do n’t talk about the office . You ’re a husky - voiced stranger who ’s tired of the patriarchy . ”
18786	18792	18793	18793	I	717	“ It did feel good . ”
18800	18806	18793	18793	I	717	“ And he liked it . ”
18807	18813	18814	18814	I	717	“ He found it unorthodox , ”
18817	18827	18814	18814	I	717	“ I ca n’t imagine that he likes it . ”
18828	18833	18834	18834	she	602	“ Men are weird , ”
18837	18855	18834	18834	she	602	“ He does seem to like unpleasant things . I think his favorite color might be gray . ”
18856	18864	18865	18865	Mia	92	“ Gray is n’t even a color , ”
18868	18876	18865	18865	Mia	92	“ It ’s a shade of black . ”
18877	18889	18890	18890	She	602	“ Yeah ! It ’s a shade of black , motherfucker ! ”
18893	18899	18900	18900	I	717	“ That ’s the spirit ! ”
18914	18927	18928	18928	Mia	92	“ The secret to improv like this is that you just commit , ”
18931	18943	18928	18928	Mia	92	“ Whatever comes out of your mouth , go with it . ”
18944	18990	18991	18991	Mia	92	“ So weird . I ca n’t even look at him at work , or Sasha might think I ’m flirting with him , but I can call him up in the middle of the night and tell him exactly how I feel about him . ”
18997	19002	18991	18991	Mia	92	“ Best job ever . ”
19151	19167	19145	19145	I	717	“ Because you ca n’t or wo n’t learn how to work an alarm clock , ”
19262	19268	19259	19260	Queen Latifah	129	“ Wrath of My Madness . ”
19312	19315	19316	19316	he	986	“ Yeah ? ”
19343	19366	19367	19367	I	717	“ Wake up , you stupid motherfucker . People are waiting for whatever annoying bullshit you have in store for them today . ”
19383	19397	19374	19374	I	717	“ Your hapless minions await whatever stupid bullshit flows from your meteoric mind . ”
19401	19415	19374	19374	I	717	“ So that really is your technique . It was n’t a fluke . ”
19416	19424	19367	19367	I	717	“ You have a problem with it ? ”
19425	19438	19439	19439	I	717	“ Not a problem , other than I just wanted to know . ”
19456	19462	19449	19449	he	986	“ This is about curiosity ? ”
19463	19542	19543	19543	Fear	130	“ Are you honestly surprised by that ? ‘ Wake up , you stupid motherfucker ’ ? You ’re literally the worst wake - up - call girl on the planet . I thought maybe it was a mistake , but no , it seems that this really is how you wake people up . Frankly , I do n’t understand how you ’re still employed . Because you should n’t be . You absolutely should n’t be . ”
19555	19565	19566	19566	he	986	“ I tried to call back and ask yesterday , ”
19569	19594	19566	19566	he	986	“ You would n’t pick up . You made me wait until now to get my question answered . I do n’t appreciate it . ”
19600	19603	19604	19604	I	717	“ Well … ”
19633	19636	19622	19622	she	511	“ Um … ”
19637	19640	19641	19641	he	986	“ Yes ? ”
19648	19657	19658	19658	I	717	“ But if you were calling me back , ”
19661	19681	19682	19682	I	717	“ it means you were awake , right ? Which means my duty was completed successfully . And efficiently , ”
19685	19708	19709	19709	Asshole	131	“ No , it means you insulted and annoyed a client . Does your boss know you speak to people like that ? ”
19719	19735	19736	19736	he	986	“ Do you not understand how a wake - up call is supposed to go ? ”
19739	19787	19736	19736	he	986	“ Because whatever you think you ’re doing here , it is n’t something I should be asked to pay for . You ’re supposed to call the person and say good morning . Inform him as to the temperature outside and briefly tell him the forecast . ”
19836	19844	19845	19845	he	986	“ Now let ’s try it again , ”
19848	19857	19845	19845	he	986	“ Call me again and do it properly . ”
19858	19864	19816	19816	he	986	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
19865	19875	19845	19845	he	986	“ I ’m trying to do you a favor . ”
19876	19902	19845	19845	he	986	“ You want me to do some role - play now ? And then you ’re going to get me into trouble with my boss ? ”
19903	19922	19816	19816	he	986	“ At least you ’ll know how to do a proper wake - up call in the future . ”
19923	19937	19845	19845	he	986	“ What do you even know about wake - up calls ? Nothing . ”
19938	19949	19950	19950	he	986	“ I know a lot about wake - up calls , ”
19953	19960	19950	19950	he	986	“ More than you might imagine . ”
19961	19968	19969	19969	I	717	“ No , you know nothing . ”
19986	20059	20060	20060	He	986	“ How do you know I ’m not the best wake - up caller on the whole East Coast ? Because guess what ? You are totally awake . I bet you ’re more awake after two minutes of my awesomeness than repeated calls from any other service . Come on , tell me . Has any other service gotten you to the level of alertness that I ’ve gotten you to ? ”
20066	20071	20072	20072	I	717	“ I think not , ”
20075	20082	20072	20072	I	717	“ That ’s not the point . ”
20083	20104	20105	20105	I	717	“ Oh , it ’s totally the point . I ’m amazing , and you are lucky to have me . ”
20120	20123	20124	20124	I	717	“ However , ”
20127	20144	20124	20124	I	717	“ due to your back talk and poor attitude , I ’m thinking about firing you . ”
20145	20149	20124	20124	I	717	“ Excuse me ? ”
20150	20160	20161	20161	I	717	“ You ’re a bad client . The worst . ”
20195	20222	20192	20192	he	986	“ Are you telling me there are people out there who prefer this kind of wake - up call ? This is just what you do ? ”
20263	20269	20259	20259	I	717	“ What do you think ? ”
20270	20308	20259	20259	I	717	“ I do n’t know . That ’s why I ’m asking you . Are there other people you speak to like this ? Are there people out there who prefer a rude wake - up call ? ”
20309	20322	20259	20259	I	717	“ That ’s funny , I thought you were the expert here . ”
20323	20328	20259	20259	I	717	“ Answer the question . ”
20400	20403	20404	20404	he	986	“ Well ? ”
20452	20468	20449	20449	I	717	“ I do n’t know if you deserve an answer . What with your attitude . ”
20469	20473	20474	20474	he	986	“ Excuse me ? ”
20477	20482	20474	20474	he	986	“ You heard me . ”
20534	20555	20531	20531	I	717	“ The current temperature at JFK is thirty - seven degrees with periods of light rain forecasted throughout the day . ”
21745	21751	21752	21752	she	511	“ You look nice today , ”
21760	21764	21765	21765	I	717	“ Thank you , ”
21782	21792	21793	21793	She	511	“ Maybe this dress looked better on the rack . ”
21799	21803	21804	21804	I	717	“ Been there . ”
21839	21848	21849	21849	she	511	“ The wake - up - call service , ”
21870	21878	21852	21852	I	717	“ Is it still … working out ? ”
21879	21890	21891	21891	She	511	“ Apparently so . Mr. Drummond wants an extra call . ”
21897	21937	21891	21891	She	511	“ This is his office line , to be used only for the purposes of an extra call to be placed by the current operator he ’s working with . The call is to be made at precisely 9:20 a.m. ”
21938	21941	21942	21942	I	717	“ Huh , ”
21950	21953	21942	21942	I	717	“ Really . ”
21954	22012	22018	22018	I	717	“ Yeah , I do n’t know , maybe he ’s planning a nap up there or something . And you ’re to specifically request that the operator working with the Vossameer account be assigned to this job , but it should n’t be obvious he ’s the client . Have them PayPal invoice me . Understand ? ”
22013	22017	22018	22018	I	717	“ I understand , ”
22043	22061	22062	22062	she	642	“ Unusual , I know . But there ’s always a method to Mr. Drummond ’s madness , ”
22067	22073	22074	22074	I	717	“ Of course there is , ”
22077	22089	22074	22074	I	717	“ But this request is for a call in two hours . ”
22090	22102	22062	22062	she	642	“ Are you saying you think you ca n’t handle it ? ”
22103	22111	22112	22112	I	717	“ I ’ll put in the order , ”
22115	22147	22112	22112	I	717	“ I do n’t know how they assign things over there , in terms of scheduling the operators . I suspect that they might schedule twenty - four hours in advance . ”
22148	22172	22173	22173	She	642	“ Figure it out . Whatever it costs . This is something Mr. Drummond wants , so this is something Mr. Drummond gets . ”
22568	22580	22581	22581	I	717	“ You ’re sure there ’s no way to arrange it … ”
22584	22607	22581	22581	I	717	“ We really would like this call to be made … no , I understand … yes , we are extremely disappointed . ”
22629	22659	22581	22581	I	717	“ The operator he wants is all booked up . They ca n’t give her any more clients . Do you want me to try for a different one ? ”
22660	22675	22676	22676	I	717	“ It ca n’t be a different one . He said her or nobody . ”
22679	22702	22676	22676	I	717	“ I tried everything . They ’re just like , ‘ No , Operator Seven is not available for another call . ’ ”
22720	22737	22581	22581	I	717	“ Not at 9:20 , not at 10:20 , not this morning , not this afternoon … ”
22748	22756	22581	22581	I	717	“ Did you offer them extra money ? ”
22757	22761	22762	22762	I	717	“ Of course , ”
22765	22804	22805	22805	She	654	“ I do n’t think there ’s anything that ’ll sway these people . No dollar figure . Nothing . Looks like I got the last slot open for their very best wake - up - call girl . ”
22808	22834	22835	22835	I	717	“ I do n’t understand . Operator Seven wo n’t take one more spot ? How hard can it be to place one more call ? ”
22838	22849	22835	22835	I	717	“ Again , I could ask about a different operator … ”
22850	22859	22860	22860	I	717	“ No , Mr. Drummond was very specific . ”
22891	22908	22885	22885	Sasha	511	“ When Mr. Drummond finds something that works , he commits to it fully and completely . ”
22909	22920	22885	22885	Sasha	511	“ Yeah . I do n’t know what to say . ”
22921	22927	22928	22928	Sasha	511	“ I do n’t either , ”
22936	22945	22928	22928	Sasha	511	“ He is going to be very disappointed . ”
23002	23014	23015	23015	Sasha	511	“ Well , if they wo n’t , they wo n’t . ”
23044	23054	23055	23055	I	717	“ I do n’t see how that can be , ”
23058	23066	23055	23055	I	717	“ It ’s a simple phone call . ”
23067	23072	23073	23073	she	654	“ My point exactly , ”
23076	23150	23151	23151	I	717	“ It ’s one simple phone call . How is that not doable ? I even offered to pay extra , but they simply were n’t interested . They did n’t even want to talk money . There ’s no more room in her schedule anywhere . It seems that I landed you the last available time slot from their very best and most in - demand wake - up - call girl . ”
23171	23191	23194	23194	she	654	“ It does n’t make sense . A wake - up - call business sells punctuality , not time . ”
23218	23230	23194	23194	she	654	“ Do you want me to try for a different operator ? ”
23231	23234	23235	23235	I	717	“ No ! ”
23245	23249	23250	23250	I	717	“ Never mind , ”
23308	23317	23302	23302	she	654	“ Should I seek out a different service ? ”
23318	23325	23302	23302	she	654	“ That wo n’t be necessary . ”
23326	23336	23302	23302	she	654	“ Somebody here could place the call for you … ”
23337	23340	23341	23341	I	717	“ No , ”
23344	23348	23341	23341	I	717	“ Leave it . ”
23420	23429	23430	23430	I	717	“ It ’s fine . I ’ll survive , ”
23466	23475	23458	23458	I	717	“ Mr. Drummond ? Is there anything else ? ”
23476	23479	23480	23480	I	717	“ Uh ... ”
23485	23497	23480	23480	I	717	“ How ’s the … uh … Instagram thing working out ? ”
23498	23503	23504	23504	she	654	“ Oh , fabulous ! ”
23507	23593	23504	23504	she	654	“ I think you ’re really going to like one of the directions I ’m having the team create . We ’re working up a behind - the - scenes view of the formulation process . A tools - of - the - trade thing . Think beakers and whiteboard shots . Race for a cure . But do n’t worry , we would n’t bother you with it or divulge trade secrets . We ’d have a junior chemist work with marketing on it . ”
23594	23597	23598	23598	I	717	“ Hmm , ”
23631	23640	23504	23504	she	654	“ I ’d take a look at that . ”
23641	23645	23504	23504	she	654	“ You would ? ”
23646	23651	23652	23652	She	654	“ Put something together . ”
24953	24956	24946	24946	He	77	“ Yeah . ”
24967	24994	24995	24995	He	77	“ Here he is , folks , answering on the first ring . Who ’s the best wake - up - call girl in the city ? ”
25010	25017	25007	25007	he	77	“ You hung up on me . ”
25018	25025	25026	25026	I	717	“ You were awake , dude . ”
25056	25089	25045	25045	I	717	“ Did I not tell you the weather ? Is n’t that how proper wake - up - call girls end their calls ? I heard it from a very reputable source . ”
25090	25103	25132	25132	he	77	“ Did you ? So you know who this is , then ? ”
25104	25121	25132	25132	he	77	“ ‘ Do you know who this is ? ’ Did you seriously just ask that ? ”
25122	25131	25132	25132	he	77	“ Do I need to ask it again ? ”
25211	25214	25197	25197	they	1718	“ Well ? ”
25215	25227	25228	25228	I	717	“ You think I do n’t know who I ’m calling ? ”
25236	25328	25228	25228	I	717	“ This is a wake - up - call service . I know exactly who I ’m calling — Theo Drummond , CEO of Vossameer . I know everything I need to know about you . Thing one : You ’re a man who ca n’t seem to operate the modern wake - up technologies specifically created for wake - up functions , so you have to hire somebody to do it for you . And then you act like a total jackalope and tell her how to do her job . ”
25357	25367	25368	25368	I	717	“ Is there anything else I need to know ? ”
25371	25385	25386	25386	He	691	“ Because that kind of says it all , do n’t you think ? ”
25398	25408	25386	25386	He	691	“ Oh , I do n’t know about that . ”
25547	25550	25551	25551	I	717	“ Well , ”
25555	25570	25551	25551	I	717	“ now that you ’re awake , let ’s see what the temperature is . ”
25571	25576	25577	25577	he	986	“ Do n’t bother , ”
25580	25595	25577	25577	he	986	“ But is n’t that how I ’m supposed to wrap up our call ? ”
25596	25610	25551	25551	I	717	“ It ’s not as if you have any idea of the temperature . ”
25611	25634	25635	25635	I	717	“ I can tell you what I think it is , though . Accuracy is so overrated , do n’t you think ? ”
25665	25675	25658	25658	I	717	“ Now , let me take a look here … ”
25676	25679	25680	25680	he	986	“ Wait , ”
25683	25690	25680	25680	he	986	“ What ? You ’re awake . ”
25724	25734	25735	25735	I	717	“ This marks the official end of my duties , ”
25738	25756	25735	25735	I	717	“ You think I do n’t have other clients waiting for my amazing wake - up service ? ”
25769	25780	25783	25783	his	986	“ So this really is how you wake people up … ”
25804	25820	25821	25821	I	717	“ That ’s for me to know and you to never find out , Theo . ”
25847	25852	25853	25853	he	986	“ Just tell me , ”
25857	25873	25853	25853	he	986	“ Is this your technique with multiple clients ? It ’s not a difficult question . ”
25874	25877	25878	25878	I	717	“ Hmm , ”
25902	25908	25909	25909	he	986	“ What ’s your name ? ”
25912	25916	25917	25917	He	986	“ Operator Seven . ”
25922	25929	25917	25917	He	986	“ Fine . One more question . ”
25930	25936	25937	25937	I	717	“ Oh , I suppose , ”
25946	25952	25941	25941	He	986	“ What are you wearing ? ”
25964	25970	25941	25941	He	986	“ What am I wearing ? ”
26021	26025	26018	26018	he	986	“ Tell me . ”
26032	26056	26018	26018	he	986	“ Yeah , I do n’t think so . I do n’t think I ’m going to tell you what I ’m wearing . ”
26087	26098	26099	26099	My	717	“ I think you want to tell me , though . ”
26107	26114	26104	26104	I	717	“ I ’m wearing something beautiful . ”
26150	26159	26141	26141	I	717	“ More beautiful than you can even imagine . ”
26174	26178	26179	26179	he	717	“ Tell me , ”
26182	26185	26179	26179	he	717	“ Now . ”
26186	26198	26179	26179	he	717	“ You think I take orders from an asshole like you ? ”
26199	26213	26179	26179	he	717	“ I think you ’d enjoy taking orders from an asshole like me . ”
26214	26218	26219	26219	I	717	“ Dream on , ”
26222	26236	26219	26219	I	717	“ In the words of Michael Jackson , U ca n’t touch this . ”
26237	26262	26179	26179	he	717	“ That was MC Hammer who said that . You need to take a little more care in terms of precision … Operator Seven . ”
26263	26272	26273	26273	I	717	“ Oh , excuse me , Professor Wonderbrain , ”
26285	26293	26279	26279	he	717	“ Tell me what you ’re wearing . ”
26301	26311	26279	26279	he	717	“ Why do guys always want to know that ? ”
26312	26375	26376	26376	I	717	“ I do n’t know why other guys would want to know that . But personally , I like my woman to have a little bit of clothes on her , so that I have something to rip off of her . That ’s why I asked . Because I need to know what exactly I ’m visualizing myself ripping off you . ”
26390	26399	26400	26400	he	986	“ I ’m imagining you in something girly , ”
26403	26409	26410	26410	I	717	“ Extra points for pink . ”
26416	26428	26410	26410	I	717	“ Have you ever had a man rip off your clothes ? ”
26456	26468	26446	26446	Mason	605	“ It depends on what qualifies as ‘ ripping off . ’ ”
26469	26474	26475	26475	he	986	“ Oh , Seven , ”
26478	26547	26548	26548	He	986	“ if you have to ask what qualifies as a man ripping off your clothes , then a man has never ripped off your clothes . A man has never been so desperate to get at your beautiful tits and your sweet pink pussy that he goes crazy , just taking the fabric in his fists and tearing it off you like a brute , blind with need … ”
26558	26569	26570	26570	he	986	“ Insane from the need to sate himself with you , ”
26582	26604	26570	26570	he	986	“ If you have to ask that , then I promise you , a man has never ripped off your clothes . ”
26640	26650	26651	26651	he	986	“ You ’re right about one thing , though , ”
26654	26671	26651	26651	he	986	“ I am an asshole . And trust me , I could make it so hot . ”
26713	26732	26705	26705	I	717	“ If nothing else , you ’re getting an A for confidence . Or maybe an A minus . ”
26746	26772	26773	26773	Shivers	151	“ You and that sassy mouth of yours . God , if I were there , I ’d put you over my knee so fast . ”
26778	26783	26773	26773	Shivers	151	“ W - what ? ”
26784	26811	26705	26705	I	717	“ I ’d put you over my knee and rip those little pj pants right off your ass and give you a good , hard spank . ”
26812	26816	26825	26825	he	986	“ Excuse me ? ”
26817	26824	26825	26825	he	986	“ You heard me just fine , ”
26828	26848	26849	26849	I	717	“ You and that smart mouth of yours need to be taught a lesson . Do n’t you think ? ”
26858	26861	26849	26849	I	717	“ Maybe . ”
26862	26868	26869	26869	he	986	“ No maybe about it , ”
26898	26908	26914	26914	he	986	“ Are you so sure I ’m wearing pjs ? ”
26909	26913	26914	26914	he	986	“ Pretty much , ”
26917	26925	26914	26914	he	986	“ Matching . A little bit prissy . ”
26926	26934	26914	26914	he	986	“ Well , are n’t you smart . ”
26935	26940	26914	26914	he	986	“ I ’m right ? ”
26941	26945	26914	26914	he	986	“ Pretty much . ”
26946	26955	26956	26956	he	986	“ I ’d make you feel so good , ”
26959	26965	26966	26966	I	717	“ Somebody ’s feeling presumptuous , ”
26988	27012	26983	26983	his	986	“ You might be taking the ‘ call girl ’ portion of ‘ wake - up - call girl ’ a little far . ”
27013	27022	27023	27023	I	717	“ Somehow I do n’t think I am . ”
27041	27047	27048	27048	he	986	“ And I promise you , ”
27051	27098	27048	27048	he	986	“ I ’d know how to handle you . You ’d want things good and dirty . So fucking dirty , and you know I ’d deliver . You might even like me to hold you down . Can you feel my hands around your thighs ? ”
27099	27102	27103	27103	I	717	“ Yes , ”
27107	27132	27103	27103	I	717	“ I am not a man with a lot of mercy in him — that ’s something you ’re figuring out right about now . ”
27160	27213	27218	27218	My	717	“ You would give yourself over to me , and I would be every inch the asshole you need me to be . I would push you right up to your edge . Maybe a little bit past it . Just a little , though . Just enough to make it interesting . ”
27214	27217	27218	27218	My	717	“ Yeah ? ”
27230	27235	27223	27224	Operator Seven	1846	“ Oh , yeah . ”
27251	27270	27236	27236	I	717	“ I can hear your hand right now . Skin sliding across fabric . Something silky , maybe . ”
27271	27278	27279	27279	He	986	“ Silky . Pink with flowers . ”
27309	27318	27319	27319	I	717	“ Tell me where you ’re touching yourself . ”
27322	27332	27333	27333	he	986	“ But only if you ’ll tell the truth , ”
27337	27360	27333	27333	he	986	“ No lies . I hate lies . What I want with you is a little bit rough and real as dirt . ”
27397	27402	27403	27403	I	717	“ Real as dirt ? ”
27406	27421	27403	27403	I	717	“ Do you think I ’m the kind of man who gives you flowers ? ”
27438	27451	27452	27452	He	986	“ If you gave me flowers , I ’d rip them up . ”
27462	27473	27474	27474	I	717	“ I ’d rip them up and throw them away , ”
27477	27486	27474	27474	I	717	“ I might enjoy seeing you do that . ”
27493	27503	27474	27474	I	717	“ Before or after you rip off my clothes ? ”
27504	27507	27508	27508	he	986	“ Before , ”
27511	27530	27508	27508	he	986	“ Trust me , once I rip off your clothes , you wo n’t be thinking about flowers . ”
27531	27534	27535	27535	I	717	“ Okay , ”
27538	27582	27535	27535	I	717	“ I ’d have your legs so wide apart . My fingers so deep in you , my thumb plying your clit so perfectly , you ’d be seeing stars . Are you touching yourself right now ? Tell me you ’re there . ”
27583	27596	27597	27597	I	717	“ I ’m not sure if we ’re actually doing that yet , ”
27657	27661	27662	27662	he	703	“ Go ahead , ”
27665	27689	27662	27662	he	703	“ It ’s my fingers there , and it ’s what I ’m doing now . I would play you like a harp . ”
27690	27698	27662	27662	he	703	“ In a nest of torn clothes . ”
27699	27756	27757	27758	Mr. Drummond	986	“ You would n’t care that your perfect pajamas are in shreds around you . You ’d just be desperate for what I can give you . Begging me for more and more . I ’d enjoy you begging me for my cock . That sexy , raspy voice of yours would get me so hard . ”
27784	27795	27772	27772	I	717	“ You are so pompous to think I ’d beg . ”
27796	27807	27772	27772	I	717	“ But I ’m right . You know I am . ”
27808	27818	27772	27772	I	717	“ Because you ’re god ’s gift to women ? ”
27819	27826	27827	27827	I	717	“ To the ones I fuck . ”
27850	27853	27843	27843	My	717	“ LOL , ”
27874	27951	27862	27862	his	986	“ I ’d get you so wet , your pussy dripping to get me in there . And you ’d be begging me so hard , you would n’t care what you sounded like . You ’d do anything to get more of whatever I decide to do to you . And your clit would be warm and slick and a little bit stiff under my touch . God , the way I ’d work you … ”
27952	27958	27959	27959	I	717	“ It was your thumb , ”
27962	27971	27959	27959	I	717	“ You were doing me with your thumb . ”
27972	27978	27862	27862	his	986	“ You liked that thumb ? ”
27979	28003	27959	27959	I	717	“ I like a certain amount of conscientiousness . Harps require attention to finger placement ; that ’s what I ’m saying here . ”
28004	28022	27959	27959	I	717	“ Baby , when I ’m doing you , you wo n’t be worrying about hand choreography . ”
28044	28061	28062	28062	I	717	“ Your entire universe would shrink to whatever I ’m doing to you with my fingers . ”
28080	28102	28074	28074	My	717	“ It ’ll be all you can do to survive the sheer pleasure overload while I make you ready for me . ”
28103	28106	28107	28107	I	717	“ Yeah ? ”
28110	28115	28107	28107	I	717	“ Oh , yeah . ”
28130	28170	28127	28127	he	707	“ You ’re wet for me right now , are n’t you ? You ’re about to combust . If I were there , I could get you off with one touch . Maybe even a puff of air . ”
28200	28204	28205	28205	I	717	“ So presumptuous , ”
28208	28227	28205	28205	I	717	“ No , I ’m realistic . Go ahead . Tell me how wet you are for me . ”
28228	28241	28191	28191	Alcatraz	154	“ I do n’t think you need any extra encouragement , mister . ”
28242	28261	28272	28272	I	717	“ Tell me anyway . Not that you could do yourself as well as I could do you . ”
28262	28271	28272	28272	I	717	“ I ’ve had a lot of practice , ”
28284	28317	28272	28272	I	717	“ I could do you so much better . I might even make you say it . Maybe I ’d keep you right on the edge until you admit it to me . ”
28318	28325	28326	28326	I	717	“ You are such a pig , ”
28329	28358	28360	28360	he	708	“ Oh I am . An utter animal . Sex with me is a dirty , savage affair . Utterly uncivilized . It ’s the opposite of civilized . ”
28390	28413	28382	28382	I	717	“ Are you feeling how wet you are ? Spread it around . I want you really wet and silky for me . ”
28443	28472	28435	28435	he	708	“ If I were there , I ’d be burying my rock - hard cock so deep in that pink little pussy , your head would be spinning . ”
28541	28545	28546	28546	he	986	“ Faster now , ”
28549	28557	28558	28558	I	717	“ You just assume I ’m masturbating , ”
28561	28570	28571	28571	he	986	“ God , you and your sassy mouth , ”
28574	28595	28571	28571	he	986	“ And yes , for the record , I do assume it . I assume you ’re close , too . ”
28596	28601	28604	28604	I	717	“ Such a freak , ”
28719	28724	28725	28725	she	711	“ Such a freak , ”
28782	28788	28789	28789	I	717	“ It ’s already happening , ”
28792	28798	28789	28789	I	717	“ You ’re already there . ”
28882	28887	28888	28888	she	711	“ Such a freak , ”
28892	28897	28898	28898	I	717	“ Whatever you need , ”
28924	28937	28938	28938	she	711	“ I love how you think the whole world revolves around you , ”
28971	28986	28987	28987	I	717	“ Me , too . I love how it revolves around me , too , ”
29040	29046	29047	29047	I	717	“ Are you almost there ? ”
29050	29064	29065	29065	Her	711	“ I need to hear you come . I know you ’re close . ”
29076	29082	29083	29083	I	717	“ You ’re almost there , ”
29166	29182	29153	29153	she	711	“ You ’re almost there , are n’t you ? And you ’re all mine . ”
29183	29186	29187	29187	she	711	“ Uh , ”
29257	29271	29272	29272	I	717	“ Do yourself , baby . You ’re every inch mine right now , ”
29275	29290	29272	29272	I	717	“ I ’ll take what I want , and it ’ll be so good . ”
29324	29327	29328	29328	I	717	“ What ? ”
29331	29334	29335	29335	she	711	“ No , ”
29338	29347	29335	29335	she	711	“ No , no , no , no . ”
29348	29352	29353	29353	I	717	“ What happened ? ”
29399	29403	29404	29404	she	711	“ What happened … ”
29407	29417	29404	29404	she	711	“ what happened … is that you ’re awake . ”
29418	29421	29422	29422	I	717	“ No , ”
29425	29428	29404	29404	she	711	“ Wait — ”
29429	29446	29404	29404	she	711	“ The weather is cloudy . It ’s a mild forty - two degrees at JFK . ”
29987	29992	29976	29976	he	986	“ Whatever , dude , ”
30237	30250	30251	30251	I	717	“ You think you ’re all that , and you ’re not , ”
30490	30496	30497	30497	I	717	“ Good morning , Betsy , ”
30500	30505	30506	30506	she	92	“ Hi , Lizzie , ”
30518	30526	30527	30527	Gulp	88	“ Sasha wants to see you ASAP . ”
30607	30614	30615	30615	She	92	“ You wanted to see me ? ”
30619	30676	30615	30615	She	92	“ IT needs a new site map for our meeting today . Will you put together complete packets with the current map , top - level - page printouts , and our overview goals ? All recent edits , PDF and hard copies , five each . Betsy will show you how to tab them up . ”
30677	30681	30682	30682	I	717	“ Of course . ”
30787	30796	30797	30797	I	717	“ We ’re supposed to tab these up ? ”
30810	30813	30814	30814	She	92	“ Ah . ”
31270	31274	31275	31275	Betsy	511	“ Mr. Drummond , ”
31278	31285	31286	31286	He	751	“ How can I help you ? ”
31622	31629	31616	31616	I	717	“ I need to see Sasha . ”
31630	31638	31639	31640	the woman	511	“ Let me see where she is , ”
31874	31883	31884	31885	the woman	511	“ Sasha ’s on the phone with IT , ”
31888	31894	31884	31885	the woman	511	“ Should I ping her ? ”
31895	31903	31884	31885	the woman	511	“ By all means . Ping her . ”
32052	32064	32065	32065	I	717	“ Mr. Drummond ! I hope you were n’t waiting long . ”
32068	32086	32065	32065	I	717	“ I ’m going to need the contact information for the wake - up - call service . ”
32087	32096	32097	32097	Sasha	511	“ I hope there is n’t a problem , ”
32109	32113	32114	32115	The receptionist	360	“ Oh no ! ”
32216	32242	32243	32243	Sasha	511	“ Mr. Drummond ? Are you no longer finding it effective ? I could find you a new service . It would be no problem , ”
32246	32274	32243	32243	Sasha	511	“ No , I ’m happy with this service you found . I just need the contact information . The name of the service . The number . ”
32286	32293	32281	32281	I	717	“ Will that be a problem ? ”
32294	32307	32308	32308	She	511	“ Sure , I could get that for you , no problem . ”
32312	32318	32308	32308	She	511	“ I ’ll email it . ”
32319	32332	32333	32333	I	717	“ I ’ll take it now , if you do n’t mind . ”
32348	32361	32362	32362	I	717	“ It ’s not on here . It ’s on my desktop . ”
32365	32372	32373	32373	She	511	“ I ’ll wait , then . ”
32380	32427	32373	32373	She	511	“ I got kicked offline . I need to go back and reboot it , and it ’ll be a bit . I do n’t want to make you wait . I ’ll email it as soon as I ’m back up . The first task . ”
32443	32452	32453	32453	she	511	“ As soon as it ’s back up , ”
32457	32466	32467	32467	I	717	“ Top of my to - do list . ”
32470	32496	32467	32467	I	717	“ Would n’t it be more efficient to have started the reboot process before you left your desk ? It would be rebooted by now . ”
32497	32503	32504	32504	she	511	“ Oh , of course , ”
32507	32528	32529	32529	I	717	“ But I thought you might be up here with an urgent matter . I ’ll have that info ASAP . ”
32548	32551	32542	32542	I	717	“ ASAP . ”
32567	32580	32552	32554	Fifteen Lizzie Sasha	511	“ Did I not ask you for those call service details yesterday ? ”
32581	32584	32585	32585	I	717	“ Yes , ”
32588	32609	32585	32585	I	717	“ Yet you did n’t see fit to provide them for me . Thanks for making me look completely foolish . ”
32610	32616	32617	32617	I	717	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
32631	32650	32585	32585	I	717	“ Do n’t be sorry , just get me the damn details . Are they on your computer ? ”
32651	32654	32585	32585	I	717	“ Yes ? ”
32655	32661	32662	32662	She	511	“ Come on , then . ”
32716	32729	32730	32730	I	717	“ It might take a bit to put my hands on it , ”
32741	32760	32730	32730	I	717	“ I ’ll have to dig around a bit . I ’m not sure where I put it … ”
32761	32776	32730	32730	I	717	“ How hard can it be ? You got it on Craigslist , right ? ”
32777	32786	32730	32730	I	717	“ Uh … that ’s what you suggested … ”
32787	32815	32730	32730	I	717	“ At some point you were going to have to pass along the details to billing , were you not ? Did you not write it down ? ”
32816	32842	32730	32730	I	717	“ I guess I was in a hurry at the time . I know I can put my hands on it , it ’s just — ”
32843	32860	32730	32730	I	717	“ That you ’re disorganized ? And that your disorganization is affecting the people around you ? ”
32905	32916	32888	32888	I	717	“ That ’s what it ’s called ? Hello Morning ? ”
32917	32922	32888	32888	I	717	“ If I recall . ”
32923	32929	32930	32930	I	717	“ You ’re not sure ? ”
32948	32955	32888	32888	I	717	“ I might have to dig . ”
32956	32963	32888	32888	I	717	“ What about your email history ? ”
32964	32970	32971	32971	I	717	“ Oh , good idea , ”
32989	32994	32995	32995	I	717	“ Oh , wait , ”
32998	33011	32995	32995	I	717	“ I was cleaning my inbox . Maybe I deleted it or … ”
33012	33023	33027	33027	She	781	“ Why on earth would you delete something like that ? ”
33293	33310	33311	33311	I	717	“ I need to take this . Have it to me in five . You understand ? ”
34836	34848	34849	34849	I	717	“ This service does n’t have an address and phone number , ”
34852	34863	34849	34849	I	717	“ I think they send emails from a PayPal address . ”
34864	34878	34849	34849	I	717	“ We ca n’t pay them from our system without that contact info . ”
34879	34883	34884	34884	I	717	“ I see , ”
34892	34904	34884	34884	I	717	“ Let me email them and try to get that info . ”
35280	35285	35286	35286	she	511	“ Something ’s fishy , ”
35289	35302	35303	35303	She	511	“ Look at the date . This ad was put up today . ”
35307	35310	35303	35303	She	511	“ Today . ”
35311	35317	35318	35318	I	717	“ I know , right ? ”
35328	35371	35318	35318	I	717	“ It turns out that sometimes the people offering services at Craigslist take down their old ads and put up new ones so that they appear at the top of Craigslist searches . It ’s a known technique that Craigslist frowns on . ”
35372	35375	35376	35376	she	511	“ Hmph , ”
35379	35389	35376	35376	she	511	“ And they do n’t even have a website . ”
35390	35396	35397	35397	I	717	“ I know , right ? ”
35400	35408	35409	35409	she	511	“ Mr. Drummond does n’t like mysteries , ”
35418	35434	35435	35435	She	511	“ This is frustrating for Mr. Drummond , and therefore it ’s frustrating for me . ”
35456	35497	35498	35498	I	717	“ Dig a little , okay ? Google the shit out of Hello Morning and see whether you can get something . Surely there is something out there . Do n’t businesses have to register with the state or something ? ”
35503	35510	35498	35498	I	717	“ I ’ll check it out . ”
35511	35575	35635	35635	she	511	“ Do n’t just check it out , give me answers . You wrangled this service . You need to handle this . I was counting on you to vet it at least a little , but apparently you did n’t do that , and now we ’re stuck with this disruptive situation . I do n’t want to disappoint Mr. Drummond again . ”
35576	35581	35498	35498	I	717	“ I ’m sorry . ”
35582	35591	35592	35592	I	717	“ Do n’t be sorry ; be proactive . ”
35620	35631	35635	35635	she	511	“ Have the answer on my desk in the morning . ”
35654	35664	35665	35665	She	511	“ How ’d the wake - up call go ? ”
35671	35679	35665	35665	She	511	“ Oh , it went … fine . ”
35689	35707	35680	35680	I	717	“ Were you just like , ‘ Wake up , motherfucker ’ ? Did it work again ? ”
35708	35722	35680	35680	I	717	“ Yeah , I guess it worked . It ’s hard to say . ”
35723	35741	35742	35742	She	511	“ Well , you still have a job , right ? So I ’d say it worked . ”
35747	35785	35786	35786	I	717	“ It ’s a very rare opportunity you have here . I hope you ’re appreciating it , because you know I am . You ’re a hero to everyone who ’s ever had a jerky boss . ”
35801	35804	35805	35805	she	511	“ What ? ”
35808	35812	35813	35813	I	717	“ What what ? ”
35816	35827	35813	35813	I	717	“ You have that look like there ’s something more . ”
35828	35836	35795	35795	she	511	“ Why would there be something more ? ”
35837	35859	35860	35860	She	511	“ Because of the look on your face . The wake - up call . What are n’t you telling me ? ”
35872	35876	35877	35877	I	717	“ Screw off ! ”
35880	35913	35914	35914	She	511	“ Oh my god , there ’s a what the size of the Chrysler Building . What happened on that wake - up call ? You ’re so gon na tell me . ”
35919	35926	35914	35914	She	511	“ You have to tell me . ”
35927	35930	35931	35931	I	717	“ Uhhhh . ”
35975	35986	35966	35966	We	826	“ Spill . You made the mean call . Right ? ”
35987	35996	35966	35966	We	826	“ Yeah , I made the mean call . ”
35997	36000	35966	35966	We	826	“ And ? ”
36001	36007	36008	36008	I	717	“ He was into it . ”
36018	36024	36025	36025	I	717	“ What does that mean ? ”
36031	36076	36077	36077	Mia	511	“ Here ’s the thing — he ’s become curious . He ’s been trying to get ahold of the firm . He wants to contract with Operator Seven — that ’s me — for … I do n’t know . An exclusive contract . ”
36096	36105	36083	36083	she	511	“ He wants Operator Seven all to himself . ”
36111	36126	36106	36106	I	717	“ That ’s a bit odd . How many naps does that asshole take ? ”
36127	36142	36143	36143	I	717	“ It ’s not the waking - up part that he ’s interested in . ”
36168	36177	36178	36178	My	717	“ Does he want more … rude conversation ? ”
36220	36231	36232	36232	Her	511	“ I would n’t say that it stayed rude exactly . ”
36239	36246	36232	36232	Her	511	“ Tell me what that means . ”
36271	36275	36264	36264	Her	511	“ Excuuuuuuse me ? ”
36284	36291	36292	36292	I	717	“ No . Freaking . Way . ”
36295	36299	36292	36292	I	717	“ Yes way . ”
36300	36311	36292	36292	I	717	“ To clarify — are we talking phone sex here ? ”
36312	36321	36292	36292	I	717	“ It did n’t go quite that far . ”
36322	36338	36339	36339	She	511	“ Quite that far ? Sexy phone calls with your asshole boss is pretty far . ”
36349	36357	36339	36339	She	511	“ Did you get to third base ? ”
36358	36381	36382	36382	She	511	“ I do n’t even know what that means . We were on the phone . Are there bases on the phone ? ”
36391	36413	36382	36382	She	511	“ You have to re - enact it . Play both parts . You call . You ’re lying in bed . ”
36414	36441	36463	36463	she	511	“ I ’m not doing a one - woman show of my almost - phone - sex wake - up call with my boss for you . ”
36442	36448	36449	36449	I	717	“ A true friend would . ”
36457	36462	36463	36463	she	511	“ You have to , ”
36466	36485	36486	36486	She	511	“ At least help me understand how it segued from ‘ you ’re such an asshole ’ to … ”
36513	36517	36518	36518	she	511	“ Come on ! ”
36538	36543	36544	36544	I	717	“ First of all , ”
36547	36565	36544	36544	I	717	“ he has this really rumbly voice . Like it wraps around you . Soft and gritty . ”
36580	36584	36544	36544	I	717	“ Wet sandpaper . ”
36585	36596	36601	36601	she	511	“ Yeah . Or else maybe extremely unforgiving velvet ribbon . ”
36597	36600	36601	36601	she	511	“ Guh , ”
36611	36626	36605	36605	She	511	“ Dude , I had a hard day at work . I need this . ”
36627	36640	36641	36641	She	511	“ One of the early highlights : I called him a jackalope . ”
36645	36651	36641	36641	She	511	“ This is already delicious . ”
36652	36663	36544	36544	I	717	“ Then he wants to know what I ’m wearing . ”
36664	36673	36544	36544	I	717	“ Ooh . A time - honored classic . ”
36674	36681	36641	36641	She	511	“ I was like , seriously ? ”
36682	36699	36641	36641	She	511	“ I ’m rolling with this completely . Did you tell him what you were wearing ? ”
36700	36731	36544	36544	I	717	“ He had guesses . And he was all stern and assholey , but in a good way . And suddenly … we’re all sexytimes . So there you go . ”
36732	36770	36641	36641	She	511	“ Wait , that ’s all I get ? What are you wearing and then it ’s all sexytimes and that ’s that ? No , no , no , no , no . I need details . ”
36771	36776	36641	36641	She	511	“ Sorry , sister . ”
36777	36780	36781	36781	She	511	“ Noooo ! ”
36786	36791	36792	36792	I	717	“ One fun highlight . ”
36795	36798	36799	36799	I	717	“ Please ? ”
36813	36863	36864	36864	She	511	“ ‘ You are such a pig ! ’ I say to him . And then he goes , ‘ Oh , I am . An utter animal . Sex with me is a dirty , savage affair . Utterly uncivilized . It ’s the opposite of civilized . ’ ”
36878	36887	36888	36888	I	717	“ That was your one and only snippet . ”
36924	36932	36917	36917	he	831	“ You ’re like a secret agent . ”
36933	36945	36946	36946	She	511	“ A secret agent who needs her sign - on bonus . ”
36953	36988	36946	36946	She	511	“ And now he wants you all to himself . His sexy wake - up - call girl . Nobody else gets her ! He will search the ends of the earth for her . ”
36989	37075	37076	37076	She	511	“ Let ’s hope not . It was totally entitled and pushy of him to be calling my wake - up agency . Sasha is looking for an excuse to fire me , but does he even consider that ? If it was a real wake - up - call service , what would that look like ? I mean , it would look utterly fishy . Yes , he ’s hot , but he ’s so oblivious to what other people are going through . ”
37079	37082	37076	37076	She	511	“ Mmm . ”
37083	37101	36946	36946	She	511	“ I do n’t need another Mason , involving himself in my life because he wants something . ”
37102	37117	37118	37118	Mia	511	“ Mason was trying to steal your business , doing shit behind your back , ”
37122	37126	37118	37118	Mia	511	“ This guy … ”
37127	37155	37076	37076	She	511	“ This guy is a control freak who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants . You ca n’t trust a guy like that . ”
37156	37165	37118	37118	Mia	511	“ They ’re not all shitty , Lizzie . ”
37166	37174	37118	37118	Mia	511	“ Three words . Microwave popcorn ban . ”
37188	37221	37180	37180	I	717	“ I ’m keeping things short and sweet tomorrow morning . I ’ll do the minimum to wake him up ; then I ’m out of there . No more extra activity . ”
37222	37237	37244	37244	I	717	“ Extra activity ? Is that what the kids are calling it these days ? ”
37238	37243	37244	37244	I	717	“ This is serious , ”
37247	37283	37244	37244	I	717	“ I doubt he ’ll fire the wake - up service at this point . Two more days , that ’s all I need . I have to keep this job for two more days . ”
37284	37297	37180	37180	I	717	“ You know he ’s going to try to trace the call . ”
37298	37320	37338	37338	Mia	511	“ Too bad it ’s a burner . Who knew I ’d ever be thankful to Mason for ruining my credit ? ”
37321	37337	37338	37338	Mia	511	“ ’ Sex with me is a dirty , savage affair . Utterly uncivilized , ’ ”
37341	37369	37370	37370	I	717	“ I want a boyfriend who says that . And he follows through . Would you be mad if I cross - stitched that for our wall ? ”
37373	37377	37378	37378	Her	511	“ Operator Seven . ”
37383	37407	37378	37378	Her	511	“ He wants more of her but he shall never have it . He ’ll have to live on tongue - lashings alone . ”
37408	37411	37412	37412	I	717	“ Shut , ”
37418	37425	37415	37415	Mia	511	“ Hot , hot tongue lashings . ”
37426	37429	37430	37430	I	717	“ It , ”
37436	37467	37433	37433	Mia	511	“ From now on , he gets me just waking him up and I ’m out of there . He ’ll see he ca n’t always have what he wants . ”
37468	37484	37485	37485	She	511	“ I think Operator Seven is looking forward to not giving him what he wants . ”
37659	37667	37650	37650	He	986	“ Time to wake up , motherfucker , ”
37678	37681	37682	37682	he	986	“ Hey , ”
37685	37689	37682	37682	he	986	“ Good morning . ”
37704	37727	37728	37728	I	717	“ It ’s not such a good morning over here . You totally and completely got me in trouble with my boss . ”
37743	37750	37735	37735	he	986	“ I got you in trouble ? ”
37751	37775	37776	37776	He	986	“ You have to stop researching Hello Morning . Stop trying to contact them . Why ca n’t you just leave it alone ? ”
37781	37825	37776	37776	He	986	“ I was interested in contracting for your time . I ’d think it would show you ’re doing a good job , if a client wants more of the service you provide . That ’s typically the sign of a good employee … ”
37826	37881	37735	37735	he	986	“ Oh please with your businessplaining . ‘ I ’d think it would show you ’re doing a good job ’ … Well , it ’s not helpful . You had to rush in there like a bull in a china shop … did you ever give a thought to another person ’s situation ? ”
37882	37889	37776	37776	He	986	“ Tell me about your situation . ”
37890	37911	37912	37912	I	717	“ I ’m not going to tell you about my situation . I ’m going to tell you about yours . ”
37916	37936	37912	37912	I	717	“ You sit there in your lofty office , and you are so oblivious , it blows my mind . ”
37937	37942	37735	37735	he	986	“ Oblivious to what ? ”
37943	37972	37912	37912	I	717	“ The effects of your actions ! Seriously . You do n’t see what you do or what ’s in front of you . That ’s your problem . ”
38016	38026	38027	38027	His	836	“ Tell me what ’s in front of me . ”
38045	38106	38027	38027	His	836	“ I just do n’t want attention drawn to me . How do you think it looks when a wake - up - call client is suddenly coming back with extra questions and requests for more time ? You need to think a little harder about how your actions affect those around you . And I mean all your actions . ”
38107	38112	38128	38128	he	836	“ I did n’t … ”
38113	38116	38117	38117	I	717	“ Think ? ”
38138	38143	38128	38128	he	836	“ I ’m sorry . ”
38199	38204	38192	38192	me	717	“ You ’re sorry ? ”
38205	38224	38192	38192	me	717	“ Is that so hard to believe ? I did n’t mean to make things hard for you . ”
38225	38232	38233	38233	I	717	“ Well , I appreciate that , ”
38236	38242	38233	38233	I	717	“ Tell me your name . ”
38243	38252	38253	38253	I	717	“ Oh , I do n’t think so , ”
38287	38292	38278	38278	He	605	“ Just a name . ”
38293	38308	38309	38309	I	717	“ You ’re paying me to wake you up . Not for my name . ”
38327	38339	38317	38317	I	717	“ You do n’t need my name for what we do . ”
38340	38349	38369	38369	He	605	“ What harm could a first name do ? ”
38350	38368	38369	38369	He	605	“ I do n’t know . What if it ’s really unusual ? Like Sassafras or something . ”
38419	38423	38424	38424	he	605	“ Tell me , ”
38432	38437	38438	38438	I	717	“ I ca n’t , ”
38451	38458	38441	38441	I	717	“ Tell me over dinner tonight . ”
38468	38471	38472	38472	He	605	“ What ? ”
38516	38525	38504	38504	he	605	“ Let me take you out . Tonight . ”
38526	38531	38539	38539	I	717	“ Are you serious ? ”
38532	38538	38539	38539	I	717	“ I ’m always serious . ”
38549	38560	38543	38543	he	605	“ You do n’t even know what I look like . ”
38561	38573	38574	38574	he	605	“ I do n’t have to know what you look like , ”
38577	38580	38574	38574	he	605	“ Risky . ”
38581	38612	38543	38543	he	605	“ I always know what I want . I enjoy you . What do I care what you look like ? I ’m a chemist . I care about chemistry . ”
38651	38657	38574	38574	he	605	“ Not gon na happen . ”
38658	38676	38753	38757	a handsome captain of industry	845	“ Why ? Is it because you are n’t single ? Because you do n’t like men ? ”
38677	38733	38574	38574	he	605	“ So those are the only two choices ? I must be married or not into men if I wo n’t go out to dinner with you ? Because otherwise , wild horses would n’t keep me away ? Is that what you ’re thinking ? Because any single hetero woman would totally say yes ? ”
38734	38738	38739	38739	I	717	“ Pretty much . ”
38742	38749	38739	38739	I	717	“ It ’s just a fact . ”
38788	38806	38770	38770	he	845	“ Well , you ’ll have to find one of those other legions of women to ask . ”
38807	38838	38839	38839	I	717	“ I want it to be you . Think of a restaurant . Any restaurant in Manhattan . The best restaurant you ’ve never gotten a chance to go to . ”
38851	38897	38839	38839	I	717	“ Do you not have enough romantic challenges in your life ? Is that it ? So you have to see whether you can land the strangely resistant wake - up - call girl ? Is this your version of the Iron Man or something ? ”
38898	38903	38904	38904	he	845	“ Anywhere . Anytime , ”
38907	38920	38904	38904	he	845	“ Trust me , you ’ll want to say yes to this . ”
38921	38925	38839	38839	I	717	“ Arrogant much ? ”
38926	38933	38934	38934	I	717	“ Not arrogant . Just realistic . ”
38938	38947	38948	38948	I	717	“ You do n’t quit , do you ? ”
38961	38966	38954	38954	I	717	“ Pick a night . ”
38967	38980	38981	38981	I	717	“ Let ’s see . Let me get out my social calendar . ”
38986	39014	38981	38981	I	717	“ Oh my god ! I have the perfect spot for you . How about … nowhere and never . Would nowhere and never work for you ? ”
39015	39026	39027	39027	he	845	“ That wo n’t work for me , Operator Seven , ”
39042	39046	39047	39047	Shivers	151	“ Try again . ”
39052	39056	39057	39057	I	717	“ Not happening , ”
39064	39078	39057	39057	I	717	“ Eventually you ’re going to say yes . We both know it . ”
39088	39096	39057	39057	I	717	“ We ’ll see , Mr. Drummond . ”
39097	39106	39107	39107	Oops	168	“ Did you just call me Mr. Drummond ? ”
39128	39157	39057	39057	I	717	“ You ’ve been demoted from Theo . And if you ’re out of line one more time , you ’ll be demoted further . To just Drummond . ”
39158	39191	39192	39192	My	717	“ Give me one actually valid reason we ca n’t meet . You ’ve been thinking about me . You pictured me while you got yourself off after our last phone call . ”
39200	39208	39209	39209	His	717	“ Of course you would think that . ”
39213	39224	39209	39209	His	717	“ I do n’t think that , I know it . ”
39225	39236	39209	39209	His	717	“ Okay , I ’m officially calling you Drummond now . ”
39237	39255	39209	39209	His	717	“ If I ’d been there in person , you ’d ’ve had a much better time . ”
39256	39273	39209	39209	His	717	“ Right , I forgot . You could do me better than I could do myself . ”
39274	39287	39288	39288	I	717	“ You would n’t forget that if you went out with me . ”
39424	39433	39434	39434	I	717	“ We ’re not going out to dinner , ”
39437	39452	39434	39434	I	717	“ It ’s just impossible . There are crucial business reasons that prevent it . ”
39453	39467	39410	39410	his	986	“ How about I buy the company and change those crucial business reasons ? ”
39473	39491	39410	39410	his	986	“ How about if you try to do that , you ’ll never hear from me again ? ”
39492	39510	39434	39434	I	717	“ I ’ll hear from you again . You ’re my wake - up - call girl . ”
39511	39544	39434	39434	I	717	“ You sure I ’ll stay your wake - up - call girl ? Your company ordered wake - up calls . Watch out , I might switch with operator number five . ”
39545	39577	39578	39578	I	717	“ No , you wo n’t . You have to call me . You would n’t trade with anyone even if you could . You like what I do to you . ”
39582	39587	39578	39578	I	717	“ Do go on . ”
39588	39603	39604	39604	I	717	“ You ca n’t get enough . And you know what else I think ? ”
39633	39643	39624	39624	I	717	“ I know you ’re going to tell me . ”
39644	39669	39670	39670	I	717	“ I think you do n’t talk to anybody else the way you talk to me . I think I ’m the only one . ”
39673	39679	39680	39680	He	717	“ You so desperately hope . ”
39725	39746	39747	39747	I	717	“ Look , I ’m going to be honest here , since that seems to be a thing with you , ”
39750	39780	39747	39747	I	717	“ You are the only one I ever talk to like this . I promise . But you have to stop poking at the company . You really do . ”
39781	39793	39747	39747	I	717	“ I ’m the only one you talk to like this ? ”
39794	39801	39747	39747	I	717	“ That ’s right . Okay ? ”
39802	39808	39809	39809	he	717	“ Why ? Why me ? ”
39812	39833	39747	39747	I	717	“ Why did you decide to wake me up like that the first day ? Was it something you read ? ”
39834	39853	39747	39747	I	717	“ I ’m not getting into that with you . I ’m saying , stop contacting the company . ”
39854	39868	39747	39747	I	717	“ How about if I pass along praise for a job well done ? ”
39869	39889	39747	39747	I	717	“ I guess there ’s no harm in saying that you ’re happy with Hello Morning ’s amazing service . ”
39890	39919	39747	39747	I	717	“ Especially since my wake - up - call girl has agreed to dinner . She knows I need more of her than her sexy , raspy voice . ”
39937	39955	39962	39962	he	717	“ That had better not be a quid pro quo , because it ’s so not happening . ”
39956	39961	39962	39962	he	717	“ It ’ll happen , ”
39965	40003	39962	39962	he	717	“ You ’ll keep calling me . And you ’ll keep thinking about me after . How dirty and good I can make things for you . You know who I am . You ’ll say yes . ”
40004	40066	40080	40080	He	717	“ I think the only reason you want me to go out with you is because I said no . Everything ’s too easy for you . And suddenly you come across the one woman who seems immune to your charms . So you ’ve decided to seduce me at all costs . Seduce the wake - up - call girl . ”
40067	40079	40080	40080	He	717	“ I already seduced the wake - up - call girl . ”
40089	40097	40080	40080	He	717	“ Now I need to taste her . ”
40113	40122	40123	40123	he	717	“ I need to have you under me , ”
40126	40143	40123	40123	he	717	“ I need you to talk to me just like this while I fuck you senseless . ”
40144	40156	40123	40123	he	717	“ Are we approaching the savage animal portion of the call ? ”
40157	40165	40166	40166	I	717	“ We could be so good together . ”
40195	40201	40185	40185	I	717	“ Put us on FaceTime . ”
40202	40207	40213	40213	he	717	“ I ca n’t . ”
40208	40212	40213	40213	he	717	“ Do it , ”
40223	40246	40247	40247	He	717	“ I ’m not that kind of wake - up - call girl . No vid . No texts . No sexting . ”
40252	40264	40247	40247	He	717	“ I want to see you . Any part of you . ”
40265	40269	40279	40279	he	717	“ No go . ”
40270	40278	40279	40279	he	717	“ If you had me on FaceTime , ”
40282	40311	40279	40279	he	717	“ you ’d be able to see me up close , and you ’d see that I have a scar on the left side of my lower lip . ”
40319	40322	40316	40316	I	717	“ And ? ”
40323	40332	40316	40316	I	717	“ Are you lying down ? Lie back . ”
40333	40340	40341	40341	I	717	“ Now you ’re commanding me ? ”
40363	40387	40357	40357	I	717	“ You ca n’t see my scar that well , but when you touch it , there ’s a little edge to it . ”
40388	40394	40316	40316	I	717	“ What ’s it from ? ”
40395	40464	40357	40357	I	717	“ Boyhood fight that split open my lip . My point is , can you imagine how it would feel on your nipple ? My stiff tongue . My soft lips . And then this little edge . You ’d like the way it feels . I would make you enjoy it . With that fucking attitude of yours , you need to be made to feel everything . ”
40465	40468	40469	40469	I	717	“ Oh , ”
40480	40484	40485	40485	he	717	“ Or maybe , ”
40488	40529	40485	40485	he	717	“ … maybe I kiss you and let you feel the scar first , before I put you in a trance of pleasure with my tongue . What do you think ? Which one do you think would be best ? ”
40530	40541	40542	40542	I	717	“ I do n’t know which one would be best . ”
40556	40571	40572	40572	He	717	“ Maybe we need to get a debate team to take up the question . ”
40576	40588	40589	40589	He	717	“ Trust me , you ’ll want to decide for yourself . ”
40594	40599	40589	40589	He	717	“ There it is . ”
40600	40603	40589	40589	He	717	“ What ? ”
40604	40622	40623	40623	I	717	“ Clothes shifting . The slide of skin against skin . Where is your hand right now ? ”
40628	40632	40633	40633	I	717	“ My stomach , ”
40637	40650	40651	40651	He	717	“ sliding slowly up to caress the silky skin beneath my breast . ”
40657	40664	40665	40665	I	717	“ And now onto my nipple , ”
40668	40673	40665	40665	I	717	“ Sliding over it . ”
40674	40681	40688	40688	He	717	“ What does it feel like ? ”
40682	40687	40688	40688	He	717	“ Pebbly . Rough . ”
40702	40711	40712	40712	he	717	“ Down now . We ’re doing this , ”
40715	40721	40712	40712	he	717	“ Are you with me ? ”
40735	40741	40742	40742	He	717	“ We ’re doing it . ”
40755	40765	40742	40742	He	717	“ How wet are you ? Tell the truth . ”
40766	40771	40772	40772	I	717	“ Pretty damn wet , ”
40783	40789	40742	40742	He	717	“ You know I am . ”
40790	40796	40797	40797	he	717	“ I know , baby , ”
40800	40832	40797	40797	he	717	“ Start with a line between your legs — trace a nice heavy line . Nice and slow . Up and down . Do n’t speed up until I tell you . ”
40833	40846	40742	40742	He	717	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re telling me how to masturbate . ”
40847	40872	40797	40797	he	717	“ I ’m an arrogant control freak . You ’re going to hate me even more soon enough . Even as you crave me . ”
40873	40876	40877	40877	I	717	“ Yeah ? ”
40880	40929	40930	40930	he	717	“ I ca n’t wait to get my fingers between your legs . I ca n’t wait to own that pretty little pussy of yours . Really own it in a way you never can . My fingers are a lot bigger than yours . Big and heavy , ”
40933	40965	40930	40930	he	717	“ I ’ll have to work to be gentle with you . Because being gentle , once I get my hands on you , it ’ll be furthest from my mind . ”
40966	40969	40970	40970	I	717	“ Right , ”
40973	41013	40970	40970	I	717	“ Even with me being gentle , you ’ll be able to feel the ragged energy in my touch . It ’s dangerous as hell how bad I want you . How savage I want to be with you . ”
41014	41019	41020	41020	I	717	“ Uhng … yes , ”
41031	41054	41025	41025	him	717	“ Do n’t screw around , now . Get onto the target . Find it and feel it . Are you there ? ”
41055	41060	40970	40970	I	717	“ I ’m there . ”
41061	41075	40970	40970	I	717	“ That ’s what you can never hide from me . Feel it ? ”
41076	41079	41025	41025	him	717	“ Yes . ”
41080	41113	41114	41114	I	717	“ Slide over it . Slow and hard . No mercy . Do n’t lose contact . I would n’t . I ’d keep you going . Just enough . Just perfect . ”
41154	41164	41151	41151	my	717	“ And you ’d be wearing your lab coat . ”
41170	41202	41151	41151	my	717	“ I ’d be wearing my lab coat . Of course I would . I ’d strip you naked , but I ’d have my lab coat on over my suit . ”
41224	41230	41213	41213	I	717	“ How does it feel ? ”
41231	41236	41237	41237	I	717	“ Intense . Close . ”
41283	41291	41292	41292	he	853	“ It was always going to happen , ”
41295	41339	41292	41292	he	853	“ I was always going to have you . But I do n’t have enough of you . I close my hand over your top , fragile and silky . You ’re shivering under me , knowing what I ’m about to do . ”
41340	41345	41346	41346	I	717	“ Oh my god , ”
41353	41357	41358	41358	he	853	“ You know , ”
41361	41370	41358	41358	he	853	“ You can be hard if you want . ”
41371	41393	41394	41394	I	717	“ I ca n’t be any other way with you . I yank the fabric , tear it down the middle . ”
41415	41418	41402	41403	Mr. Drummond	986	“ Yeah . ”
41419	41474	41402	41403	Mr. Drummond	986	“ It hurts a little when I rip it , because of how hard I have to yank , but you like it . Because this is way too real . I ’m ripping your pj pants , destroying your panties . I have your nipple in my lips before you can stop me . ”
41475	41478	41479	41479	I	717	“ Ungh , ”
41502	41506	41507	41507	he	986	“ How hard ? ”
41510	41522	41507	41507	he	986	“ Tell me . I always make you tell me everything . ”
41523	41527	41528	41528	I	717	“ Medium hard , ”
41531	41547	41548	41548	I	717	“ A tiny bit of pain . Just enough to surprise me . No more . ”
41553	41557	41558	41558	he	986	“ Like that , ”
41561	41565	41566	41566	I	717	“ Like that , ”
41583	41586	41576	41576	he	986	“ Yes . ”
41587	41660	41558	41558	he	986	“ I ’m back at your clothes , pulling them off you . I do n’t give a shit , I have to get you naked for what I ’m going to do to you , how I ’m going to use your body . The cool air hits your skin . You ’re quivering below me . Of course , I have n’t even bothered to take off my lab coat . ”
41661	41668	41721	41721	He	717	“ Because you ’re an asshole . ”
41669	41702	41558	41558	he	986	“ An asshole who has you totally bared and exposed under him . And I ca n’t believe how beautiful you are like that . I ’m doing you how I want . ”
41703	41717	41718	41718	I	717	“ And I ’m into it , but a little angry , still , ”
41766	41820	41753	41753	He	717	“ You ca n’t believe you ’d fuck somebody like me , because you hate me a little bit , but it ’s what you need . My lab coat hangs open over you , and sometimes it grazes your skin . I ’m the asshole who is going crazy to fuck you . ”
41821	41826	41827	41827	I	717	“ Like some savage , ”
41830	41874	41875	41875	he	717	“ I ’ll make you beg , just because I can . Then I ’ll make you come until you cry . Because I ’m the asshole who makes it good for you . Get on your back . Get your legs wider , ”
41896	41900	41882	41882	I	717	“ Right here . ”
41901	41905	41906	41906	he	717	“ Not yet , ”
41909	41957	41906	41906	he	717	“ I ’m not done with you . Not done kissing your pretty cunt . You can feel my scar so acutely . You squirm around , but I clamp my rough hands down on your silky thighs . Press you open to me . So good . ”
41958	41961	41962	41962	I	717	“ Yes , ”
41965	42006	42007	42007	I	717	“ I can hear you breathing , I know you feel it . Now listen — two fingers now . Go a little harder than you normally would . That ’s me , taking a good long lick . Again . ”
42014	42045	42046	42046	I	717	“ You ’re almost gone . You ’re trying to hold it together , but you ca n’t . This asshole you disdain has utter and complete control of you . ”
42054	42061	42062	42062	His	717	“ You ’re close , Seven . ”
42072	42077	42062	42062	His	717	“ So fucking close . ”
42113	42116	42117	42117	he	717	“ Yeah , ”
42124	42144	42145	42145	He	717	“ Come for me . I ’m slowing down . Stringing it out for you … that ’s it . ”
42151	42163	42145	42145	He	717	“ Goddamn , you ’re hot . So hot and dirty . ”
42191	42199	42200	42200	he	717	“ I would kiss you right now , ”
42203	42207	42208	42208	I	717	“ You would ? ”
42215	42237	42238	42238	I	717	“ I love kissing you . You ’re unlike any woman I ’ve ever met , and it drives me wild . ”
42243	42275	42276	42276	He	717	“ I get you nice and close to me now . You ’re soft to me now , and you ’ll let me do anything . So I pull you close . ”
42279	42305	42276	42276	He	717	“ Maybe I put you a little bit under me . I do n’t squish you , but I know you like to feel me . ”
42306	42309	42276	42276	He	717	“ Yeah . ”
42310	42350	42351	42351	I	717	“ Your skin is warm , and there ’s a sheen of sweat on your forehead . A drugged look in your eyes . You ’re floppy as a rag doll . That ’s what I do to you . ”
42394	42398	42391	42391	I	717	“ I feel … ”
42426	42429	42423	42423	he	717	“ Yeah . ”
42430	42439	42440	42440	I	717	“ I do n’t know what this is , ”
42443	42448	42440	42440	I	717	“ Me , either . ”
42505	42510	42501	42501	My	717	“ I should go . ”
42511	42514	42515	42515	he	717	“ Wait , ”
42531	42534	42518	42518	I	717	“ What ? ”
42535	42548	42549	42549	I	717	“ I hope I have n’t made you miss your next call . ”
42560	42567	42557	42557	I	717	“ Nothing would make you happier . ”
42568	42586	42587	42587	he	717	“ Here ’s what I do n’t get . It sounded like you were all booked up , ”
42590	42600	42601	42601	I	717	“ Yet here you are on an extended chat . ”
42628	42639	42640	42640	He	717	“ Maybe I book this long with all of them . ”
42647	42654	42640	42640	He	717	“ Kidding . I do n’t . ”
42655	42661	42662	42662	he	717	“ Let me ask you , ”
42665	42689	42662	42662	he	717	“ Why are you a wake - up - call girl ? Surely this ca n’t be what you want with your life . ”
42690	42705	42640	42640	He	717	“ You think being a wake - up - call girl is too lowly ? ”
42706	42716	42640	42640	He	717	“ I think you ’re more ambitious than that . ”
42717	42724	42662	42662	he	717	“ You do n’t know me . ”
42725	42847	42662	42662	he	717	“ Do n’t I ? I know you said something outrageous during our first call . You were coloring outside the lines . Experimenting . Or maybe it was an accident . I sometimes think that . I do n’t know why you said it , but you did , and then you went with it . Followed where it led . That ’s what a creative , ambitious person does . She tries different angles . Turns accidents into advantages . It makes me think you ’re used to running your own show . Not doing a job a machine could do . You make things happen . You have a strong will . Yet you have integrity , too . ”
42848	42854	42640	42640	He	717	“ Integrity . My goodness . ”
42855	42884	42662	42662	he	717	“ If you did n’t have integrity , I think you would ’ve taken me up on dinner . Or tried to squeeze me for money by now . ”
42885	42901	42662	42662	he	717	“ Maybe I ’m playing the long game . Maybe I ’m just that good . ”
42902	42961	42962	42962	I	717	“ You ’re not working me . No , I ’d know if you were working me . What ’s more , you do n’t take shit from me . You ’re capable and you stick up for yourself . So what are you doing making wake - up calls ? That ’s what I keep asking myself . ”
43056	43062	43138	43138	he	605	“ Are n’t you observant . ”
43063	43123	43138	43138	he	605	“ I ’m a scientist . Observant is part of the job description . Still , what I ca n’t figure out is why you get so nervous when I set my sights on Hello Morning . Why do you care so deeply about a job you ’re so utterly overqualified for ? As if it ’s a lifeline . ”
43124	43132	43138	43138	he	605	“ Do you analyze everyone like this ? ”
43133	43137	43138	43138	he	605	“ Just you , ”
43238	43258	43259	43259	he	986	“ For a moment , I thought maybe you ’re homebound , somehow , or maybe caring for somebody , ”
43262	43322	43323	43323	I	717	“ But homebound or not , with your communication abilities and apparent control over your schedule , you ’d be doing something that pays better . Sometimes I wonder whether you ’re on the run or hiding . That would give you time on your hands , and also explain why you wo n’t go to dinner with me . ”
43326	43343	43323	43323	I	717	“ And we ’re back to that , folks ! The most baffling question of all . ”
43344	43352	43353	43353	I	717	“ It is the most baffling question . ”
43356	43368	43369	43369	His	986	“ Then I think to myself , are you in trouble ? ”
43374	43380	43369	43369	His	986	“ Is somebody threatening you ? ”
43381	43390	43391	43391	I	717	“ Your imagination is definitely running wild now , ”
43421	43469	43418	43418	I	717	“ Answer me . Do you feel unsafe ? Is your boss at Hello Morning the problem ? Is it a boyfriend ? A husband ? An ex ? If you ’re feeling unsafe , you should tell me . You really , really should tell me . ”
43470	43473	43481	43481	His	986	“ Drummond — ”
43474	43480	43481	43481	His	986	“ I can be persuasive . ”
43530	43532	43533	43533	me	717	“ helping ”
43542	43549	43550	43550	I	717	“ I ’m not feeling unsafe , ”
43562	43566	43550	43550	I	717	“ You promise ? ”
43567	43570	43571	43571	I	717	“ Promise , ”
43590	43594	43550	43550	I	717	“ All right . ”
43595	43671	43672	43672	He	868	“ Just stop trying to contact Hello Morning , okay ? And FYI , my boss at Hello Morning is a woman , and she ’s absolutely awesome . Promise you will only have praise for me and my service . Or even better , leave it alone . Listen to me for real here . The fastest way to ensure you never hear from me ever again is to get involved in my life . ”
43676	43687	43688	43688	I	717	“ I ’m pretty freaking capable , do n’t forget , ”
43691	43713	43714	43714	He	868	“ Things are under control over here . Stop being so serious . This is just a wake - up call . ”
43747	43763	43744	43744	He	868	“ I ’m not serious , I ’m realistic . People frequently confuse the two . ”
43764	43769	43744	43744	He	868	“ Realistic , then . ”
43770	43783	43744	43744	He	868	“ I see things for what they are . No candy coating . ”
43784	43792	43744	43744	He	868	“ What ’s wrong with candy coating ? ”
43793	43799	43744	43744	He	868	“ It ’s a lie . ”
43800	43813	43744	43744	He	868	“ I ’m guessing you do n’t like jelly beans , then . ”
43814	43847	43744	43744	He	868	“ I do n’t mind candy coating on candy . It ’s everywhere else that it annoys me . Family pictures at Christmas . The smile on the barista taking your order … ”
43848	43855	43744	43744	He	868	“ What , you hate kindness ? ”
43856	43864	43744	43744	He	868	“ Kindness is just another survival strategy . ”
43865	43879	43744	43744	He	868	“ Oh my god . That is such a sad thing to think . ”
43880	43886	43744	43744	He	868	“ Realistic is not sad . ”
43887	43894	43744	43744	He	868	“ You know what you need ? ”
43895	43900	43744	43744	He	868	“ You at dinner ? ”
43901	43922	43744	43744	He	868	“ No , you need some baby goat videos in your life . That ’s what I ’m getting here . ”
43923	43934	43935	43935	I	717	“ Baby goat videos ? Is that a thing now ? ”
43938	43947	43950	43950	he	869	“ Yes , and you so need them . ”
43980	43986	43987	43987	he	869	“ Tell me something else , ”
43990	43994	43987	43987	he	869	“ Something small . ”
44017	44030	43987	43987	he	869	“ Is there a man in your life ? A significant other ? ”
44031	44041	44049	44049	he	869	“ That ’s not small , that ’s invasive . ”
44042	44048	44049	44049	he	869	“ I have a code , ”
44052	44063	44064	44064	My	717	“ I do n’t go for other guys ’ women . ”
44070	44085	44086	44086	I	717	“ Nobody ’s going for anybody here . We ’re voices on the phone , ”
44089	44094	44095	44095	he	869	“ We ’re more , ”
44098	44105	44095	44095	he	869	“ Now who ’s candy coating ? ”
44106	44113	44114	44114	he	869	“ Tell me you feel it , ”
44120	44127	44128	44128	I	717	“ There ’s no significant other , ”
44146	44161	44135	44135	he	869	“ But you ca n’t be going for me . This is n’t that . ”
44162	44169	44135	44135	he	869	“ Tell me another little thing . ”
44170	44174	44135	44135	he	869	“ So demanding . ”
44175	44186	44187	44187	He	869	“ It ’s one of your favorite things about me . ”
44220	44229	44230	44230	he	986	“ You wo n’t let me see you , ”
44233	44259	44230	44230	he	986	“ You wo n’t let me meet you . Give me this . What would you do today if you could do anything at all ? ”
44308	44322	44304	44304	he	986	“ No , my turn . What time do you go to sleep ? ”
44323	44326	44327	44327	he	986	“ Midnight , ”
44330	44343	44304	44304	he	986	“ What ? So you get four hours of sleep a night ? ”
44344	44350	44304	44304	he	986	“ Four and a half . ”
44351	44354	44355	44355	I	717	“ Jesus , ”
44358	44364	44355	44355	I	717	“ That ’s not enough . ”
44365	44378	44379	44379	he	986	“ It ’s fine . I drink a lot of bulletproof coffee , ”
44382	44391	44392	44392	I	717	“ As if that makes up for sleep , ”
44420	44430	44431	44431	I	717	“ Hold on , I know what you need , ”
44444	44449	44434	44434	I	717	“ Are you there ? ”
44450	44456	44457	44457	I	717	“ Yeah , hold on . ”
44471	44511	44465	44465	I	717	“ Hold on , here . You can text me , but I ca n’t text you ? You get to call me and text me whenever you want , and the rest of the time you block me ? ”
44512	44539	44540	44540	I	717	“ Correct . You can not text me , but I can text you . You can not call me , but I can call you . ”
44555	44561	44562	44562	he	986	“ This is a video , ”
44565	44569	44570	44570	I	717	“ Hit play , ”
44573	44585	44570	44570	I	717	“ I ’ll only answer your question if you watch it . ”
44586	44592	44593	44593	he	986	“ It ’s baby goats , ”
44596	44604	44605	44605	I	717	“ Why am I watching baby goats ? ”
44625	44633	44636	44636	him	986	“ I think you just need it . ”
44639	44645	44636	44636	him	986	“ Okay . They pranced . ”
44646	44668	44673	44673	I	717	“ Do n’t you love it ? How they kind of pop up into the air ? Watch the whole thing . ”
44705	44714	44715	44715	He	986	“ Come on . How sweetly they play ? ”
44719	44726	44727	44727	I	717	“ With their cute little faces , ”
44730	44743	44727	44727	I	717	“ You need to see that not everything is about grim survival . ”
44744	44791	44727	44727	I	717	“ Their cute little faces are exactly about survival . Baby animals all have large eyes and big foreheads because adult mammals are hardwired to consider it cute and feed them . It ’s pure , vicious survival . Survival of the fittest . Practically mercenary . ”
44792	44806	44727	44727	I	717	“ Oh my god , are you ruining baby goat videos for me ? ”
44807	44852	44727	44727	I	717	“ I ’m telling you what we ’re looking at . Over time , adult goats were more likely to nurture babies who fit the look you see here and the goats with those traits were more likely to survive to adulthood to reproduce . ”
44853	44860	44861	44861	I	717	“ Wait , how about this . ”
44920	44923	44924	44924	he	986	“ Okay , ”
44928	44946	44924	44924	he	986	“ I think I did my time . Tell me the one thing you ’d do today . ”
44947	44950	44951	44951	I	717	“ Bake , ”
44957	44976	44951	44951	I	717	“ I ’d bake cookies . That ’s what I ’d do today if I could do anything . ”
44977	44980	44924	44924	he	986	“ Cookies . ”
44992	45003	45004	45004	I	717	“ There ’s nothing like the aroma of baking cookies , ”
45032	45042	45043	45043	I	717	“ I ’m sensing you do n’t like cookies , ”
45046	45057	45043	45043	I	717	“ What the hell is wrong with cookies , Drummond ? ”
45069	45080	45060	45060	I	717	“ What the hell is wrong with cookies , Drummond ? ”
45150	45157	45139	45139	she	877	“ Who does n’t like cookies ? ”
45158	45165	45166	45166	I	717	“ They ’re a useless food , ”
45169	45177	45178	45178	she	877	“ It ’s National Pug Dog Day , ”
45182	45188	45178	45178	she	877	“ Did you know that ? ”
45229	45271	45218	45218	Willow	530	“ I would bake the cookies and frost them in honor of National Pug Dog Day . And get this — I would spend a lot of time on each cookie . Beautifully and meticulously frosting each for no reason whatsoever . ”
45291	45307	45308	45308	she	877	“ A cookie that somebody would eat in a second for the most useless holiday , ”
45311	45324	45308	45308	she	877	“ What do you think ? What ’s your opinion on that ? ”
45325	45333	45334	45334	I	717	“ I think you ’re taunting me , ”
45347	45357	45308	45308	she	877	“ Come on , tell me what you think . ”
45358	45392	45399	45399	she	877	“ What I think is that I ca n’t decide whether I want to shove you against the wall and kiss that smile right off your lips or move right into spanking you . ”
45393	45398	45399	45399	she	877	“ I ’m sorry , ”
45414	45433	45399	45399	she	877	“ I ’ll be too busy baking useless cookies for that . And they will smell so amazing . ”
45480	45508	45547	45547	She	877	“ I would watch my favorite musical while I bake . Funny Face . Have you ever seen it ? It ’s a musical with Audrey Hepburn . ”
45509	45512	45513	45513	I	717	“ Musicals , ”
45516	45526	45513	45513	I	717	“ You just do n’t quit , do you ? ”
45527	45546	45547	45547	She	877	“ I love musicals . The story goes along , and then they break into song and dance . ”
45560	45566	45567	45567	She	877	“ For no reason whatsoever . ”
45603	45624	45625	45625	she	877	“ And she wears this red dress and sings on the steps of the Louvre . It ’s the best , ”
45628	45636	45637	45637	I	717	“ And cookies are a valuable food . ”
45640	45643	45637	45637	I	717	“ Hardly . ”
45644	45653	45654	45654	she	877	“ Did somebody slip you a bad cookie ? ”
45657	45666	45667	45667	She	877	“ Did somebody have a traumatizing cookie experience ? ”
45673	45681	45667	45667	She	877	“ Never mind . I ’m sorry . ”
45784	45789	45790	45790	I	717	“ Just do n’t , ”
45793	45798	45790	45790	I	717	“ Do n’t what ? ”
45799	45863	45790	45790	I	717	“ Do n’t do what you just did . Assume that my dislike of cookies is because of a tragedy that happened half a lifetime ago . Apparently there ca n’t be an article written about me without some armchair psychologist weaving that narrative about my never quite recovering from that . As if it drives everything I do . It ’s ignorant … ”
45864	45879	45790	45790	I	717	“ Well , you did invent the one thing that might ’ve saved her . ”
45880	45940	45790	45790	I	717	“ Yes , maybe it would ’ve saved her , who knows , but this bullshit story that I heroically dedicate my life to Vossameer to spare others the pain and so forth … it ’s simply not accurate . I promise you . It ’s not how it was , and it ’s not how it is now . ”
45941	45944	45790	45790	I	717	“ Okay . ”
45945	45951	45952	45952	I	717	“ It ’s fucking annoying , ”
45956	45959	45960	45960	I	717	“ Sorry . ”
46051	46073	46074	46074	My	717	“ When people say that about me , when they go on like that , it makes me feel … alone . ”
46108	46114	46115	46115	she	711	“ Makes you feel alone , ”
46194	46201	46202	46202	I	717	“ I do n’t know why , ”
46208	46271	46202	46202	I	717	“ It ’s as if those fake stories that paint me to be a heroic phoenix , rising from tragedy or some such shit — it ’s as if they ’re about somebody else . They ’re painting a picture of somebody else . And they leave me feeling alone . I want for somebody to not do that . One person . ”
46272	46275	46276	46276	she	711	“ Isolated , ”
46279	46285	46276	46276	she	711	“ The stories isolate you . ”
46286	46291	46292	46292	My	717	“ Yes , exactly . ”
46301	46307	46308	46308	she	711	“ I ’ll do it , ”
46311	46327	46328	46328	I	717	“ It ’s official , then . You ’re no hero . Just Theo Drummond . ”
46331	46335	46328	46328	I	717	“ Thank you . ”
46336	46349	46308	46308	she	711	“ Theo Drummond . Just some jackalope on my roster of calls . ”
46350	46360	46328	46328	I	717	“ Well , no need to go that far . ”
46361	46371	46372	46372	I	717	“ You and your innovations . Whatevs , dude . ”
46401	46414	46393	46393	I	717	“ You want to know what else is messed up about it ? ”
46415	46418	46419	46419	she	711	“ What ? ”
46454	46468	46469	46469	I	717	“ A little - known secret about being a so - called hero , ”
46472	46494	46469	46469	I	717	“ When you go around saying you ’re not a hero , people are even more eager to call you one . ”
46495	46506	46507	46507	she	711	“ Heroes are notorious for saying they ’re not heroes , ”
46510	46531	46507	46507	she	711	“ It ’s like one of those finger traps that tighten the harder you try to pull out of them . ”
46532	46565	46469	46469	I	717	“ Maybe you need to walk around like , ‘ yeah , I ’m a hero , biotches . Screw you all . I ’m the greatest hero in the world ! ’ ”
46628	46636	46622	46622	she	711	“ I suppose that would do it . ”
46637	46641	46642	46642	I	717	“ Too extreme ? ”
46650	46663	46664	46664	She	711	“ Where are you right now ? Kitchen , bedroom , office … ”
46680	46683	46670	46670	she	711	“ Bedroom . ”
46684	46691	46622	46622	she	711	“ What does it look like ? ”
46692	46705	46670	46670	she	711	“ I think I need to take a broom to the ceiling . ”
46706	46713	46670	46670	she	711	“ What color is your ceiling ? ”
46714	46726	46622	46622	she	711	“ White . It ’s got gorgeous crown molding , though . ”
46727	46734	46622	46622	she	711	“ You like a nice ceiling . ”
46772	46785	46767	46767	She	711	“ My favorite is the pressed tin ceilings . The real ones . ”
46792	46812	46789	46789	I	717	“ Come on , you ’ll go out to dinner with me eventually . Why not just say yes ? ”
46813	46826	46827	46827	She	711	“ Yeah , well , I hate to say this , but … ”
46832	46847	46827	46827	She	711	“ I hear you ’re not the hero everyone makes you out to be . ”
46848	46859	46789	46789	I	717	“ I ’m something better . I ’m an asshole . ”
46860	46872	46827	46827	She	711	“ An asshole , and you ’ll make it SO good . ”
46937	46961	46934	46934	she	711	“ I ’m the asshole who ’ll never candy coat things for you . But I can give you what you really want . ”
46964	46970	46971	46971	I	717	“ Tell me your name . ”
46993	46997	46998	46998	she	711	“ The weather , ”
47001	47004	46998	46998	she	711	“ No . ”
47021	47034	47011	47011	She	711	“ The weather at JFK is forty - five and partly cloudy . ”
47725	47731	47732	47732	I	717	“ What do you think ? ”
47735	47749	47732	47732	I	717	“ Good . Except you have two whoms . Who says whom anymore ? ”
47750	47754	47755	47755	I	717	“ I do . ”
47775	47786	47759	47759	She	530	“ Whatever . I ’m not making any guarantees here . ”
47787	47796	47797	47797	I	717	“ I know . Anything you can get , ”
47800	47813	47797	47797	I	717	“ Anything . Every shred of info . I want it all . ”
47814	47820	47821	47821	She	530	“ Of course you do . ”
47829	47904	47821	47821	She	530	“ I ’m curious , too . This whole thing is weird . The discrepancy with the date , the fact the old versions of the ad are n’t present on any of the Wayback sites . Not that the caches are infallible , but come on . And I think it ’s weird that they do n’t have a site . If they ’re a real company , they should have a site . ”
47905	47910	47911	47911	She	530	“ You ’d think . ”
47918	47932	47911	47911	She	530	“ Come on , tell me . What ’s your interest in this ? ”
47933	47945	47946	47946	She	530	“ Having my answer without a lot of explanation , ideally . ”
47956	47965	47966	47966	She	530	“ I might not get anything at all . ”
47995	47998	47999	47999	she	530	“ Spill , ”
48002	48015	47999	47999	she	530	“ Maybe I do n’t like unanswered questions . Sorry to disappoint . ”
48016	48036	47986	47986	she	530	“ Oh you ’re hardly disappointing . I have n’t seen you in this good a mood in forever . ”
48037	48046	47999	47999	she	530	“ You think this is a good mood ? ”
48047	48053	48054	48054	She	530	“ For you it is . ”
48059	48065	48054	48054	She	530	“ You seem almost happy . ”
48066	48079	48080	48080	She	530	“ Must be all the baby goat videos I ’ve been watching . ”
48287	48296	48297	48297	Willow	530	“ What ’s up with the daffy look ? ”
48300	48305	48297	48297	Willow	530	“ Refresh it again . ”
48306	48316	48278	48278	she	530	“ Not until you tell me what ’s up . ”
48317	48334	48278	48278	she	530	“ I have this wake - up - call girl that I … have questions about . ”
48335	48338	48339	48339	she	530	“ Questions , ”
48350	48368	48339	48339	she	530	“ Yes , questions . And it ’s using up bandwidth I need for solving dehydrated Vossameer . ”
48384	48393	48394	48394	she	530	“ You get to have things for yourself , ”
48397	48401	48394	48394	she	530	“ I know . ”
48402	48427	48428	48428	I	717	“ Yeah , I do n’t think you do . You deserve to be happy even if you do n’t nail this new formula . ”
48441	48457	48458	48458	She	530	“ Fine . I ’m shutting up . Here ’s me shutting up , okay ? ”
48466	48477	48458	48458	She	530	“ I mean , they may not email back forever . ”
48478	48502	48503	48503	I	717	“ Judging from the correspondence so far , there ’s a better than fifty percent probability they reply in the first ten minutes , ”
48507	48514	48503	48503	I	717	“ Otherwise , some point today . ”
48515	48525	48458	48458	She	530	“ Is this something you ’ve worked out scientifically ? ”
48526	48531	48532	48532	I	717	“ Not that hard , ”
48541	48544	48538	48538	I	717	“ Nothing . ”
48655	48668	48669	48669	she	530	“ I ’m just saying , you ’re more than your innovations , ”
48679	48687	48688	48688	she	530	“ What if it ’s an address ? ”
48691	48698	48672	48672	I	717	“ Do you march down there ? ”
48699	48734	48669	48669	she	530	“ I ’ll know what to do when I see what you get . It would be stupid to decide how to act on information when I do n’t know what that information is . ”
48735	48740	48741	48741	she	530	“ Sorry , Sherlock , ”
48744	48755	48756	48756	I	717	“ I think of that approach as more Michael Faraday . ”
48760	48764	48765	48765	she	530	“ Four minutes , ”
48846	48849	48840	48840	She	530	“ Gotcha ! ”
48905	48911	48912	48912	She	530	“ Did you capture anything ? ”
48923	48926	48927	48927	She	530	“ Theo . ”
48931	48940	48941	48941	She	530	“ Do n’t jerk me around . What ? ”
48950	48960	48941	48941	She	530	“ The email is coming from inside the building . ”
48961	48966	48941	48941	She	530	“ Are you sure ? ”
48967	48981	48941	48941	She	530	“ Now you really do have to tell me what ’s going on . ”
48982	48992	48993	48993	I	717	“ I do n’t have to tell you dick . ”
49028	49102	49026	49027	Vossameer Inc.	77	“ It ’s one of your employees acting as a wake - up service . It seemed fishy to you because it is . Let me guess , you ’ve burned through every wake - up service out there trying to hold to that mad schedule of yours , and some desperate employee took it on herself to do it for you . I hope you did n’t abuse the person too much . ”
49103	49108	49109	49109	I	717	“ Not too much , ”
49164	49168	49169	49169	she	511	“ Mystery solved , ”
49175	49197	49198	49198	I	717	“ That ’s what ’s going on , right ? You could tell it was a fake thing because it is . ”
49204	49212	49198	49198	I	717	“ So who ’s the unlucky caller ? ”
49213	49236	49237	49237	I	717	“ Probably Sasha Bale . In marketing . You ’ve never met her . Except the caller did n’t sound like her , ”
49241	49250	49237	49237	I	717	“ This caller has a more raspy voice . ”
49251	49269	49198	49198	I	717	“ Yeah , there ’s an app for that . There ’s a dozen apps for that . ”
49270	49276	49281	49281	she	511	“ It was so realistic — ”
49277	49280	49281	49281	she	511	“ App , ”
49284	49292	49281	49281	she	511	“ But the way her voice would — ”
49293	49296	49198	49198	I	717	“ App . ”
49297	49300	49301	49301	My	717	“ Damn . ”
49392	49401	49402	49402	I	717	“ I suppose she gets points for resourcefulness , ”
49405	49419	49402	49402	I	717	“ It ’s just that she does n’t seem like the type to … ”
49420	49438	49439	49439	I	717	“ To invent a wake - up - call service out of desperation for her demanding boss ? ”
49464	49491	49492	49492	Willow	530	“ She did seem flustered when I asked her about it . Like she had something to hide . I wondered about it at the time . ”
49495	49507	49508	49508	I	717	“ And then she writes that ad . After you ask . ”
49675	49681	49670	49670	Willow	530	“ I got ta go . ”
49705	49719	49699	49699	Wags	183	“ Do n’t be too hard on her . She was probably desperate . ”
50480	50484	50490	50490	she	711	“ Mr. Drummond ? ”
50504	50512	50513	50513	She	711	“ Thank you for coming , Sasha . ”
50518	50522	50513	50513	She	711	“ My pleasure . ”
50543	50553	50527	50527	She	711	“ Are you eating ? Should we order first ? ”
50554	50567	50568	50568	She	711	“ I ’ll handle it . Do you know what you want ? ”
50576	50581	50568	50568	She	711	“ Are you eating ? ”
50653	50663	50648	50648	I	717	“ I ’m having the soup of the day . ”
50664	50678	50639	50639	she	530	“ Tomato basil . I was thinking about that . Make it two . ”
50679	50683	50639	50639	she	530	“ Any dessert ? ”
50684	50692	50693	50693	I	717	“ I ’ll see how I feel . ”
50835	50839	50840	50840	she	530	“ Thank you , ”
50843	50852	50840	50840	she	530	“ I did n’t know you came here . ”
50853	50860	50840	50840	she	530	“ I do n’t , typically . ”
50861	50879	50880	50880	she	530	“ The soup here is always delicious . And they have this rosemary bread that ’s incredible , ”
50893	50896	50883	50883	I	717	“ Excellent . ”
50959	50965	50949	50950	A woman	342	“ People love a story , ”
50976	51055	50966	50966	Sasha	711	“ They love a little drama . They love to pull for the underdog , and this lets them in on that . We ’ve identified a few junior chemists who already run things for you who could log your daily progress — nothing proprietary , of course . We ’d get an image of the day — papers and beakers or whatever . Communications could tweak the write - ups to get them into layman ’s terms . ”
51091	51094	51095	51095	she	530	“ Yeah ? ”
51128	51131	51132	51132	She	530	“ Right ? ”
51139	51154	51132	51132	She	530	“ So this Instagram story , maybe we create a header or a name . ”
51193	51206	51207	51207	I	717	“ I like that it ’s about the process and the product , ”
51210	51219	51207	51207	I	717	“ That ’s what people should focus on . ”
51220	51223	51224	51224	She	530	“ Exactly . ”
51227	51243	51224	51224	She	530	“ But I guess that ’s not why you called me here , is it ? ”
51244	51255	51256	51256	I	717	“ I think you know why I called you here , ”
51280	51284	51285	51285	she	530	“ To brainstorm … ”
51290	51294	51295	51295	I	717	“ The calls , ”
51298	51304	51295	51295	I	717	“ I know , Sasha . ”
51305	51313	51259	51259	She	530	“ Are they … still working out ? ”
51314	51322	51323	51323	She	530	“ You know they ’re working out . ”
51331	51335	51323	51323	She	530	“ Do I ? ”
51336	51374	51375	51375	She	530	“ Drop the act . They ’re amazing , and you know it , because you ’re the one making them . They ’re my favorite part of the day . Let ’s talk about the calls . ”
51399	51412	51395	51395	she	530	“ You ’re right . I think they ’re amazing , too . ”
51413	51426	51427	51427	Her	530	“ So come out to dinner . You know you want to . ”
51433	51443	51444	51444	I	717	“ I get it , I ’m your boss , ”
51447	51510	51511	51511	She	530	“ If you do n’t want things with me to move that way , then I ’m fine to drop it here and now . But if your constant refusal to have dinner or to let me help you is because you think there might be some trouble at the company … look , I ’ll rewrite the corporate rules right now . ”
51516	51525	51526	51526	She	530	“ One dinner . See how it goes . ”
51538	51543	51535	51535	I	717	“ It is tempting . ”
51544	51547	51548	51548	I	717	“ So … ”
51559	51569	51556	51556	she	530	“ I knew you would … figure it out . ”
51575	51586	51570	51570	She	530	“ But just out of curiosity , how did you ? ”
51587	51601	51602	51602	Her	530	“ You corresponded with me as Hello Morning from inside the Vossameer building . ”
51606	51609	51602	51602	Her	530	“ Oops . ”
51610	51626	51627	51627	She	530	“ The way you sounded when you were making yourself come this morning … Sasha … ”
51652	51665	51648	51648	She	530	“ This place … I feel like we ’re in a fishbowl … ”
51666	51672	51638	51638	she	530	“ So come to dinner . ”
51673	51684	51685	51685	She	530	“ Hold on , I just felt my phone go . ”
51693	51704	51685	51685	She	530	“ Work meltdown . I absolutely have to handle this . ”
51705	51710	51648	51648	She	530	“ What is it ? ”
51711	51722	51723	51723	She	530	“ It ’s nothing that needs to be your problem . ”
51726	51733	51723	51723	She	530	“ A fire to put out . ”
51734	51737	51738	51738	I	717	“ Dinner , ”
51741	51748	51749	51749	She	530	“ Tonight . Does seven work ? ”
51752	51760	51749	51749	She	530	“ Am I crazy to say yes ? ”
51761	51764	51723	51723	She	530	“ Probably . ”
51765	51779	51780	51780	I	717	“ Fine . Let ’s do this ! Name the time and place . ”
51783	51799	51800	51800	She	530	“ I ’ll text you . You ’ll have to unblock me , of course . ”
51805	51818	51800	51800	She	530	“ You know what ? Email would be better . Way better . ”
51819	51828	51837	51837	She	530	“ You ’re not going to unblock me ? ”
51829	51836	51837	51837	She	530	“ It ’s a long story . ”
51850	51859	51837	51837	She	530	“ I really do wish I could stay . ”
51860	51866	51867	51867	I	717	“ I ’ll email you . ”
52146	52151	52152	52152	she	711	“ Take a seat , ”
52170	52185	52186	52186	I	717	“ Do you know why I ’ve called you in ? Can you guess ? ”
52191	52198	52199	52199	she	711	“ How about taking a guess , ”
52219	52236	52237	52237	I	717	“ The wake - up - call service . There is n’t one , is there ? ”
52254	52266	52247	52247	She	711	“ It ’s you . It ’s been you all along . ”
52289	52298	52286	52286	I	717	“ I can explain — I really can , ”
52354	52368	52369	52369	Sasha	711	“ Well , I wanted to tell you that I appreciate your ingenuity . ”
52382	52391	52374	52374	Hope	190	“ You ’re not going to fire me ? ”
52392	52421	52422	52422	I	717	“ Of course not . Why would I ? Mr. Drummond appreciates the service . Most men would be paying ten bucks a minute for calls like that . ”
52437	52440	52433	52433	he	973	“ Uh … ”
52441	52474	52475	52475	She	711	“ You think I would n’t find out ? You impersonated a wake - up - call service that escalated to you masturbating and climaxing on the phone , with your boss … ”
52481	52490	52475	52475	She	711	“ With him telling you what to do . ”
52543	52555	52539	52539	I	717	“ I do n’t get it . I ’m not fired ? ”
52568	52586	52561	52561	She	711	“ Lizzie , I ’m sure you did n’t mean things to go that way . Right ? ”
52587	52592	52593	52593	I	717	“ Not at all ! ”
52596	52632	52593	52593	I	717	“ It was the furthest thing from my mind . When that Canadian place flaked out on me , I just wanted to replicate an effective service . I only wanted to keep my job . ”
52633	52637	52638	52638	She	711	“ Of course . ”
52644	52658	52638	52638	She	711	“ Though it did start out rather unorthodox , you have to admit . ”
52696	52699	52700	52700	she	711	“ Right ? ”
52703	52751	52752	52752	Her	711	“ It was n’t supposed to be like that — I swear . I meant it to be boring and normal , but my roommate and I were goofing off , and when I said all those mean things , I did n’t know he was there . ”
52756	52764	52752	52752	Her	711	“ So what exactly did you say ? ”
52783	52791	52768	52768	he	986	“ I really did n’t mean it . ”
52792	52798	52799	52799	she	711	“ You ’re not fired , ”
52802	52815	52799	52799	she	711	“ But I should know how it started . Just in case . ”
52831	52864	52865	52865	She	711	“ Well … I said , ‘ wake up , motherfucker . ’ Something like that . ‘ People are waiting for whatever bullshit you have in store for them today . ’ ”
52869	52877	52865	52865	She	711	“ You said that to Mr. Drummond ? ”
52878	52918	52919	52919	She	711	“ I honestly did n’t know he was there . And … actually I think it might have been ‘ stupid asshole ’ that I called him . Jackalope . I do n’t know ; it all blends in . ”
52946	52957	52939	52939	he	976	“ So I guess that ’ll wake a guy up . ”
52958	52964	52965	52965	I	717	“ I should think so ! ”
52975	53014	53020	53020	she	711	“ When I realized he was on the line , I thought for sure I ’d be fired . When he came down here and called it unorthodox , you could ’ve knocked me over with a feather . ”
53026	53033	53034	53034	She	711	“ You ’re really not mad ? ”
53037	53050	53034	53034	She	711	“ It ’s a little bit funny , you have to admit . ”
53067	53073	53074	53074	she	711	“ So he enjoyed that ? ”
53087	53155	53156	53156	She	711	“ I do n’t know that he enjoyed it . I do n’t know , maybe he was more … surprised . Maybe he ’s sick of everyone kissing his ass . I think his interest was more about curiosity . What kind of a wake - up caller says that ? That ’s why he did n’t fire the service . He ’s a puzzle guy . ”
53162	53181	53182	53182	I	717	“ Very true . Theo does not like a puzzle he ca n’t crack . So then what ? ”
53185	53192	53182	53182	I	717	“ It was just phone sex . ”
53236	53250	53223	53223	Sasha	511	“ One phone sex call is pretty much the same as the next . ”
53315	53321	53308	53308	She	1946	“ So that ’s all ? ”
53334	53341	53308	53308	She	1946	“ Yeah , that ’s all . ”
53342	53347	53348	53348	She	1946	“ Okay , then . ”
53368	53393	53348	53348	She	1946	“ I need somebody up in marketing . No … no … there ’s no problem , just an escort out of the building . ”
53432	53450	53429	53429	her	1946	“ I ’m going to have to ask you to get your things and exit the building . ”
53451	53460	53410	53410	Sasha	511	“ You said I was n’t getting fired ! ”
53461	53489	53490	53490	I	717	“ You ca n’t be fired ; you ’re not a real employee yet . You ’re on probation , and that probationary period is now over . ”
53493	53513	53490	53490	I	717	“ Sasha , please . Tomorrow ’s the last day for me to get my bonus . One day . ”
53514	53519	53520	53520	Sasha	511	“ I ’m sorry . ”
53536	53552	53490	53490	I	717	“ You were given an opportunity to do the most meaningful work of your life — ”
53553	53601	53490	53490	I	717	“ I did do meaningful work ! Think of all the great work I did . The engagement numbers . The Instagram strategies . Please , I ’ll do anything . I ’ll work an extra week with no pay . I just need that bonus tomorrow . ”
53602	53633	53490	53490	I	717	“ The bonus is for employees who do n’t commit fraud and pull the CEO into compromising situations . He could bring you up on charges of fraud and pandering . ”
53634	53645	53646	53646	I	717	“ What ? No . It was n’t like that . ”
53650	53711	53646	53646	I	717	“ No ? Maybe it was all fun and games for you , but Mr. Drummond is angry and disgusted , and really , how could you blame him ? He does n’t want you calling him anymore . Not ever again . You contact him one more time and he really will look into pursuing further action against you . ”
53935	53943	53933	53933	Sasha	511	“ I want to see Mr. Drummond . ”
53961	53983	53984	53984	I	717	“ Mr. Drummond does n’t want to see you . Trust me . You do n’t want to push your luck . ”
53999	54008	54009	54009	I	717	“ Well , at least I ’m free , ”
54012	54039	54009	54009	I	717	“ This place sucks , and you know it . And if you do n’t , you need to pull your head out of your ass . ”
54040	54045	54046	54048	The security guy	986	“ Let ’s go . ”
54054	54064	54065	54065	I	717	“ Do n’t worry , I know the way . ”
54248	54258	54259	54259	I	717	“ It ca n’t merely be a good place , ”
54263	54293	54259	54259	I	717	“ I want a great place . Something stylish , but not too fussy . She ’s the kind who ’d be into comfort food , but with flair . ”
54294	54297	54298	54298	Willow	530	“ Okay , ”
54301	54307	54298	54298	Willow	530	“ Comfort food with flair . ”
54308	54313	54314	54314	I	717	“ Stylish and fun , ”
54317	54373	54314	54314	I	717	“ It can be slightly quirky , but not all - out weird . Not quirky for quirky ’s sake . And the food has to be excellent . Taste - wise , but also in terms of how it looks . The plate has to look beautiful . And above all , elaborate desserts . ”
54374	54383	54384	54384	she	530	“ What have you done with my brother ? ”
54387	54395	54314	54314	I	717	“ Will you help me or not ? ”
54396	54403	54314	54314	I	717	“ You really enjoyed those calls . ”
54404	54413	54314	54314	I	717	“ Do I have to ask somebody else ? ”
54414	54439	54314	54314	I	717	“ No , I ’m sending you a link . The Blue Stag Club . But it ’ll be impossible to get a table … ”
54440	54443	54444	54444	I	717	“ Thanks , ”
54452	54456	54444	54444	I	717	“ Got it . ”
54586	54592	54584	54584	me	717	“ Can I help you ? ”
54593	54601	54602	54602	I	717	“ I ’m hoping for dinner reservations , ”
54605	54623	54602	54602	I	717	“ Seven tonight . What do I have to do to get this table for seven tonight ? ”
54624	54630	54631	54631	He	995	“ It ’s not possible . ”
54661	54664	54665	54665	he	995	“ Really , ”
54668	54674	54665	54665	he	995	“ We have a policy . ”
55102	55108	55109	55109	she	511	“ The jackalope has arrived ! ”
55140	55145	55146	55146	I	717	“ You look lovely , ”
55154	55162	55149	55149	She	511	“ So do you , Mr. Drummond . ”
55163	55171	55172	55172	She	511	“ I ’m back to Mr. Drummond ? ”
55181	55188	55189	55189	She	511	“ Oh , that whole thing … ”
55200	55209	55189	55189	She	511	“ I say we start from square one . ”
55224	55227	55215	55215	I	717	“ Ready ? ”
55228	55232	55233	55233	I	717	“ Sure am . ”
55270	55277	55287	55287	she	511	“ Have you heard of it ? ”
55278	55286	55287	55287	she	511	“ Heard of it ? Of course ! ”
55290	55300	55287	55287	she	511	“ I thought they were booked out for months . ”
55301	55322	55323	55323	She	511	“ They were . I did an in - person visit to get a table . I was … persuasive . ”
55328	55333	55323	55323	She	511	“ It ’s perfect . ”
55364	55367	55368	55368	she	511	“ Gorgeous , ”
55449	55457	55458	55458	I	717	“ You ’re so full of surprises , ”
55461	55467	55468	55468	She	511	“ What do you mean ? ”
55481	55491	55468	55468	She	511	“ I would n’t have guessed a dry martini . ”
55516	55520	55508	55508	I	717	“ Why not ? ”
55521	55529	55530	55530	She	511	“ I would ’ve guessed something sweeter . ”
55535	55540	55530	55530	She	511	“ Such an asshole . ”
55541	55545	55546	55546	I	717	“ Excuse me ? ”
55554	55559	55549	55549	She	511	“ You heard me . ”
55636	55654	55655	55655	She	511	“ Can I ask you , what made you call me like that in the first place ? ”
55659	55702	55703	55703	She	511	“ There actually was another service set up . A Canadian service . But I was so nervous they would n’t come through that I set up a call for myself for ten minutes before that . And they never came through . ”
55738	55775	55734	55734	I	717	“ I was so paranoid when I saw you next . I thought for sure you ’d fire me . You could ’ve knocked me over with a feather when you said the service was unorthodox ! ”
55807	55813	55799	55799	I	717	“ I ’m saving room . ”
55832	55837	55838	55838	I	717	“ Uh - oh , ”
55841	55845	55838	55838	I	717	“ User error ? ”
55846	55863	55818	55818	She	511	“ Just a little one . It would be a shame to ruin this beautiful jacket . ”
55864	55881	55882	55882	She	511	“ I had half a mind to wear my lab coat . Maybe I should ’ve . ”
55885	55899	55882	55882	She	511	“ To the Blue Stag ? Why on earth would you do that ? ”
55900	55908	55818	55818	She	511	“ I thought you might appreciate it . ”
55909	55917	55918	55918	She	511	“ Well , you know I do . ”
55952	55957	55958	55958	I	717	“ Talk to me , ”
55967	55973	55958	55958	I	717	“ What do you mean ? ”
55974	56005	56014	56014	She	511	“ This is me . We ’re here . Cards on the table . Are you feeling weird about this ? I want you to tell me if you are . ”
56006	56013	56014	56014	She	511	“ Why would you think that ? ”
56019	56037	56014	56014	She	511	“ I ’m happy we ’re out , finally . It ’s just all … so unusual . ”
56038	56042	56043	56043	I	717	“ It is , ”
56053	56090	56043	56043	I	717	“ The phone calls — that ’s not something I do every day . Or ever . And I want you to know , I ’m not expecting anything . We ’re just out for dinner . ”
56106	56112	56113	56113	she	511	“ It had to happen , ”
56116	56120	56113	56113	she	511	“ I mean … ”
56121	56130	56097	56097	she	511	“ Well , you were pretty against it . ”
56131	56137	56138	56138	She	511	“ Can you blame me ? ”
56150	56155	56138	56138	She	511	“ I suppose not . ”
56296	56307	56289	56289	I	717	“ What do you think about that situation over there ? ”
56308	56313	56349	56349	She	892	“ The dessert tray ? ”
56314	56318	56289	56289	I	717	“ Those cookies ? ”
56319	56323	56324	56324	She	892	“ Probably shortbread . ”
56327	56337	56338	56338	I	717	“ Meh . I ’m not a dessert person . ”
56357	56362	56363	56363	I	717	“ So tell me , ”
56366	56373	56363	56363	I	717	“ what ’s your favorite movie ? ”
56374	56384	56385	56385	My	717	“ Gone with the Wind . What ’s yours ? ”
56389	56396	56363	56363	I	717	“ How about your favorite musical ? ”
56397	56400	56363	56363	I	717	“ Why ? ”
56401	56408	56363	56363	I	717	“ Just … need to know . ”
56409	56421	56363	56363	I	717	“ I do n’t know . I suppose I like Grease . ”
56426	56433	56434	56434	She	892	“ Grease is your favorite musical ? ”
56439	56446	56434	56434	She	892	“ You have something against Grease ? ”
56447	56453	56454	56454	She	892	“ You ’re not her . ”
56463	56484	56454	56454	She	892	“ I like all kinds of movies . What I like at any one time is dependent on my mood . ”
56493	56502	56454	56454	She	892	“ Why are you pretending to be her ? ”
56503	56518	56519	56519	I	717	“ What on earth are you talking about ? You think I ’m pretending ? ”
56525	56531	56532	56532	She	892	“ You ’re not her . ”
56539	56554	56532	56532	She	892	“ Why would you pretend ? Who is she ? I need to know . ”
56563	56594	56555	56555	She	892	“ Okay , fine . Cards on the table . I ’m worried about you . You invited a wake - up - call girl you never met to dinner . ”
56595	56631	56632	56632	She	892	“ And you impersonated her . Look , just give me her contact information — the real contact information — and we ’ll go back to how things were . No harm , no foul . ”
56665	56674	56660	56660	I	717	“ You ’re a beautiful , charming woman . ”
56675	56679	56680	56680	she	892	“ Save it , ”
56683	56705	56707	56707	she	892	“ Why create the fake front in the first place ? Please tell me , is Operator Seven somebody you know ? ”
56725	56729	56730	56730	I	717	“ The information , ”
56733	56738	56730	56730	I	717	“ I want it . ”
56827	56832	56833	56833	She	892	“ Just a name . ”
56840	56844	56845	56845	She	892	“ Forget it . ”
56932	56935	56936	56936	she	892	“ Nooo , ”
56939	56942	56936	56936	she	892	“ Fired ? ”
56943	56964	56969	56969	She	892	“ It ’s not technically a firing when you ’re still on your probationary period . I learned that today . ”
56965	56968	56969	56969	She	892	“ Honey . ”
56983	56987	56988	56988	I	717	“ What happened ? ”
57010	57043	57044	57044	She	892	“ I liked him . I trusted him . It felt so … real . But it was n’t . How did I not learn my lesson about trusting guys like that ? ”
57056	57074	57044	57044	She	892	“ Screw it . Trust is an act of bravery . So he can just fuck himself . ”
57075	57148	57003	57003	she	892	“ I felt brave around Mr. Drummond . I went places with him I never even went with Mason . But it was n’t really about that — it was like I had this feeling of discovery with him . Like Amelia Earhart , traveling through new territory . Except not alone . We were a team in a way I ca n’t explain . That ’s how it felt , anyway . ”
57149	57157	57158	57158	I	717	“ Amelia Earhart perished over the Pacific . ”
57166	57214	57158	57158	I	717	“ And I perished over Lexington Avenue . Because he takes what he wants . He warned me , even . He took and took and took , and then he did n’t even bother to fire me personally . What kind of an idiot am I ? ”
57215	57256	57044	57044	She	892	“ It ’s beautiful to trust . It ’s beautiful to open your heart . Do n’t let that asshole take that away . He ’s small and mean , and you ’re huge with your beautiful , amazing heart . ”
57257	57270	57158	57158	I	717	“ And in the end it ’s the least of my problems . ”
57271	57278	57279	57279	she	1032	“ Blow jobs for a buck ? ”
57288	57300	57301	57301	I	717	“ It ’s not even funny . I ’m so sorry , ”
57304	57315	57301	57301	I	717	“ What do you have to apologize to me about ? ”
57316	57368	57044	57044	She	892	“ Um , being the cause of angry loan sharks about to invade our home when I do n’t have their money ? I have two days until thugs with pinky rings and guns come to collect money I do n’t have . I do n’t want you in the crossfire . ”
57369	57387	57301	57301	I	717	“ Crossfire ? What crossfire ? Do n’t tell me you ’ll be packing heat , too . ”
57388	57392	57393	57393	I	717	“ Not funny . ”
57399	57422	57423	57423	she	1033	“ If they think they ’re gon na clip you for that fourteen G ’s , they ’ve got another think coming , ”
57426	57433	57423	57423	she	1033	“ What are you even saying ? ”
57434	57444	57445	57445	Mia	511	“ I ’m boning up on my mobster talk , ”
57453	57459	57460	57460	she	1033	“ There ’s a smile , ”
57463	57487	57460	57460	she	1033	“ That was n’t a smile . I want you to start thinking about where you ’ll sleep while I deal with them . ”
57488	57503	57504	57504	she	1033	“ What do you mean , deal with them ? What does that mean ? ”
57511	57514	57504	57504	she	1033	“ Lizzie … ”
57515	57519	57520	57520	I	717	“ Not that , ”
57523	57534	57520	57520	I	717	“ I only whore to strange men on the phone . ”
57535	57555	57556	57556	Sasha	511	“ Mr. Drummond should pay . He ’s the one who got you fired . Make him help you . ”
57569	57601	57564	57564	He	1034	“ I ’m the last person he ’d help . He ’s not who I thought he was . And I ’m serious . You need to crash somewhere Saturday night . ”
57610	57645	57564	57564	He	1034	“ I ’m not leaving you . If you stay , I stay . Also , I totally have to see the kind of cookies you frost for it . They ’ll be epic . ”
57646	57662	57699	57699	She	1035	“ You ’re not staying . If something happened to you , I ’d die . ”
57663	57676	57677	57677	She	1035	“ Goes both ways , sister . We ’re in this together . ”
57712	57715	57699	57699	She	1035	“ Want ? ”
57716	57724	57725	57725	She	1035	“ You are the best friend ever . ”
57750	57762	57725	57725	She	1035	“ So does this mean I have to take it down ? ”
57763	57766	57767	57767	She	1035	“ What ? ”
57825	57836	57837	57837	She	1035	“ Oh my god ! You have finally gone insane . ”
57844	57849	57837	57837	She	1035	“ It ’s stupid . ”
57850	57853	57854	57854	I	717	“ No ! ”
57867	57880	57881	57881	She	1035	“ It ’s funny . At least he gave us a laugh . ”
57982	57997	57998	57998	she	511	“ He smelled like a body spray factory and made an assholey actress joke , ”
58001	58004	57998	57998	she	511	“ Next . ”
58005	58009	58010	58010	She	511	“ Like what ? ”
58013	58051	58052	58052	She	511	“ How many actresses does it take to screw in a light bulb ? One to screw it in and ninety - nine to stand there and say , ‘ it should be me up there ! ’ ”
58057	58064	58052	58052	She	511	“ Soooo funny . Fuck off . ”
58065	58069	58070	58070	I	717	“ Fuck off , ”
58086	58091	58073	58073	Mia	511	“ What an asshole . ”
58448	58453	58454	58454	I	717	“ Go fuck yourself , ”
58709	58717	58699	58699	She	530	“ It ’s six in the morning . ”
58718	58723	58724	58724	I	717	“ It ’s 6:10 , ”
58739	58753	58733	58733	I	717	“ What ’s going on ? Did you confront the woman in marketing ? ”
58754	58765	58699	58699	She	530	“ It was n’t her . We need a plan B. ”
58766	58772	58733	58733	I	717	“ You were so sure . ”
58773	58784	58785	58785	She	530	“ What can I say ? It was n’t her . ”
58790	58797	58785	58785	She	530	“ You seem happy about it . ”
58798	58812	58824	58824	she	530	“ I do n’t know . I do n’t know anything right now . ”
58845	58865	58866	58866	She	530	“ Aaaaaand you need your brilliant sister to find your wake - up - call girl some other way . ”
58893	58898	58891	58891	Seven	1846	“ go fuck yourself , ”
58963	58966	58967	58967	she	530	“ Theo , ”
58970	59001	58967	58967	she	530	“ The woman said ‘ fuck yourself ’ and destroyed her phone when you called . Magic 8 - Ball says … she does n’t want to talk to you . ”
59002	59019	59020	59020	Willow	530	“ Something else is going on . She would n’t just cut things off like that . ”
59023	59064	59020	59020	Willow	530	“ Yes , I know how that sounds , but you do n’t know her , and I do . If nothing else , I want to make sure things are okay . Did Sasha come down on her somehow ? ”
59065	59083	59084	59084	I	717	“ And there ’s the thing where you still want to go out to dinner with her . ”
59092	59107	59087	59087	Willow	530	“ Let me ask you this . How were you paying for this service ? ”
59108	59123	59020	59020	Willow	530	“ I already hit up accounting . They do n’t have the contact information . ”
59124	59133	59087	59087	Willow	530	“ Right , but how were you paying ? ”
59134	59137	59138	59138	She	530	“ PayPal . ”
59141	59150	59138	59138	She	530	“ I say we pay them , then . ”
59151	59154	59087	59087	Willow	530	“ Why ? ”
59155	59171	59172	59172	She	530	“ So we can follow the money . Assuming the PayPal account is still there . ”
59204	59213	59188	59188	Willow	530	“ We probably just paid Sasha thirty bucks . ”
59214	59244	59245	59245	We	1068	“ I know , but you have to look at everything . Sometimes when you do that and you look at your statement , you get a business name . ”
59267	59275	59252	59252	she	530	“ Is Sasha ’s last name Waves ? ”
59276	59283	59288	59288	Willow	530	“ No , it ’s Bale . ”
59284	59287	59288	59288	Willow	530	“ Interesting , ”
59291	59298	59288	59288	Willow	530	“ Sea turtle avatar . Huh . ”
59299	59305	59306	59306	She	530	“ Let ’s Google O.Waves . ”
59312	59321	59322	59322	She	530	“ We have something better , Mr. Bond . ”
59333	59337	59322	59322	She	530	“ Deep Web . ”
59359	59362	59363	59363	she	530	“ Wow , ”
59366	59372	59363	59363	she	530	“ She covered her tracks . ”
59373	59376	59377	59377	I	717	“ Damn , ”
59384	59398	59377	59377	I	717	“ Sasha wo n’t take a bribe to tell who the caller is ? ”
59399	59451	59452	59452	I	717	“ She tried to impersonate her , then refused to tell me . I ’ve been in business long enough to know when somebody can be bought . All Sasha ’s getting is a pink slip as soon as I figure out how to do it without HR up my ass . ”
59462	59470	59452	59452	I	717	“ She could sue you so hard . ”
59471	59493	59377	59377	I	717	“ Forget Sasha , I need the caller . We know the caller might work at Vossameer , but not necessarily . ”
59494	59501	59452	59452	I	717	“ You have hundreds of employees . ”
59502	59510	59452	59452	I	717	“ We know she ’s a she . ”
59511	59518	59377	59377	I	717	“ You do n’t know that . ”
59519	59530	59377	59377	I	717	“ It ’s an assumption . Will you accept that ? ”
59804	59809	59800	59801	A woman	342	“ This is Amy . ”
59810	59818	59826	59826	she	71	“ I ’m looking for Lizzie Cooper . ”
59819	59825	59826	59826	she	71	“ She ’s not here , ”
59830	59840	59826	59826	she	71	“ Is there something I can help you with ? ”
59841	59848	59800	59801	A woman	342	“ When will she be back ? ”
59849	59854	59800	59801	A woman	342	“ She ’s gone . ”
59855	59861	59826	59826	she	71	“ Gone ? What happened ? ”
59862	59871	59800	59801	A woman	342	“ I ’m sorry , who is this ? ”
59872	59878	59879	59879	I	717	“ It ’s Mr. Drummond , ”
59882	59896	59879	59879	I	717	“ And I ’m asking you to tell me what happened down there . ”
59897	59918	59800	59801	A woman	342	“ W - well , all I know is that she walked out of here saying this place sucks and … ”
59919	59923	59800	59801	A woman	342	“ And what ? ”
59924	59938	59879	59879	I	717	“ That we all need to pull our heads out of our asses ? ”
59943	59947	59948	59948	I	717	“ Thank you , ”
60620	60623	60631	60631	I	717	“ Hello ? ”
60624	60630	60631	60631	I	717	“ Delivery for Ms. Cooper . ”
60689	60693	60680	60683	the loan shark guys	1103	“ From who ? ”
60694	60697	60698	60698	I	717	“ Vossameer . ”
61108	61112	61113	61113	I	717	“ Screw you , ”
61558	61565	61551	61551	Her	511	“ Lizzie … Oh my god . ”
61607	61626	61602	61602	Mia	511	“ Lizzie . No . Whatever you ’re thinking . You do n’t have to resort to that . ”
61627	61630	61631	61631	She	511	“ What ? ”
61647	61652	61637	61637	I	717	“ Dude . No . ”
61653	61666	61602	61602	Mia	511	“ What ? I come home and you ’re all dressed up … ”
61667	61730	61637	61637	I	717	“ You think I ’d wear this to prostitute myself ? I do n’t know if I should be insulted that you think I ’d actually do it , or that you think I ’m insane enough to pick this out for the occasion . It ’s not like I ’m whoring myself to the ladies of the Audrey Hepburn Appreciation Society . ”
61731	61752	61637	61637	I	717	“ I do n’t even understand anything of what ’s happening here . Why would you buy a beautiful gown ? ”
61753	61766	61767	61767	I	717	“ This dress is more dimensions of assholery from Theo freaking Drummond . ”
61777	61783	61773	61773	She	511	“ He has some nerve . ”
61784	61792	61805	61805	she	511	“ Like I ’ll go to dinner . ”
61793	61804	61805	61805	she	511	“ Go . And demand the sign - on bonus , ”
61808	61831	61805	61805	she	511	“ On what grounds ? The contract says I have to last thirty days . I did n’t last the thirty days . ”
61832	61844	61773	61773	She	511	“ He sent you this dress . Maybe you should go . ”
61845	61946	61773	61773	She	511	“ That ’s what he wants , do n’t you see ? This is not a dress . It ’s a power play . He thinks I ’ll go . And even if I go with elaborate fantasies of telling him off , he thinks he can get me to sit down to dinner . He thinks he can get me to kiss him . To sleep with him . Get me to the next step . He probably had me fired so he can make it all happen without fear of a lawsuit . This guy plays to win . ”
61947	61952	61805	61805	she	511	“ That is cold . ”
61953	62036	61773	61773	She	511	“ And arrogant . And ruthlessly efficient , which we knew about him . This is the man who does n’t even want his employees to be comforted by treats or decorations lest it detract from their efficiency . I mean , really ? Now I ’m going to sleep with you ? You think you ’re so hot and amazing with your lab coat and your bad - boy lips that I ’ll just sleep with you after you fire me ? ”
62037	62043	62044	62044	She	1118	“ The hell with that ! ”
62055	62063	62044	62044	She	1118	“ He has bad - boy lips ? ”
62064	62068	62069	62069	I	717	“ Shut it , ”
62078	62088	62089	62089	I	717	“ I should do something drastic to the dress , ”
62092	62112	62089	62089	I	717	“ like cut it up and send it back to him , but he ’s not worth the energy . ”
62113	62119	62120	62120	I	717	“ Wait . Come here . ”
62124	62160	62120	62120	I	717	“ At least I look good . If you ’re going to be beaten by loan sharks , you should at least look awesome . That ’s my new motto . What do you think ? ”
62161	62165	62166	62166	I	717	“ Turn around . ”
62174	62181	62182	62182	she	1118	“ Oh , hell , yes , ”
62185	62192	62182	62182	she	1118	“ This is an Iggy Miyaki ! ”
62193	62196	62231	62231	She	1118	“ Iggy ... ”
62197	62230	62231	62231	She	1118	“ Miyaki . A dress designer . Socialites love her stuff for the big parties . I heard about her when I nannied . You even see her stuff at the Oscars . ”
62242	62252	62231	62231	She	1118	“ This dress could be worth several thousand dollars . ”
62253	62256	62182	62182	she	1118	“ Really ? ”
62257	62261	62182	62182	she	1118	“ Several thousand . ”
62262	62279	62231	62231	She	1118	“ You think they ’ll let me return it for cash ? I highly doubt it . ”
62280	62294	62231	62231	She	1118	“ No , but they ’ll let us return it for store credit . ”
62295	62302	62314	62314	Mia	511	“ And that helps me how ? ”
62303	62313	62314	62314	Mia	511	“ You ’ll see . Mia has a plan , ”
62321	62341	62314	62314	Mia	511	“ Should I be scared that you ’re undressing me and talking about yourself in third person right now ? ”
62342	62352	62353	62353	We	1119	“ Scared of how brilliant I am , maybe . ”
62393	62403	62404	62404	I	717	“ I wish they would do this at Target , ”
62411	62419	62420	62420	She	511	“ God , that would be dangerous . ”
62468	62487	62463	62463	I	717	“ This would be the perfect thing … if Lenny was a high - fashion cross - dresser . ”
62488	62492	62493	62493	We	1119	“ Part two . ”
62527	62533	62534	62534	she	511	“ Little - known secret , ”
62541	62550	62534	62534	she	511	“ Rich women are the ultimate penny pinchers . ”
62641	62645	62646	62646	he	101	“ Six large , ”
62649	62655	62646	62646	he	101	“ Where ’s the rest ? ”
62656	62664	62665	62665	I	717	“ Since this is two days early , ”
62668	62683	62684	62684	He	101	“ I thought maybe I could get a few extra days for the rest . ”
62693	62700	62701	62701	He	101	“ I ’m doing my best . ”
62708	62721	62701	62701	He	101	“ I do n’t want anything to happen to you , but … ”
62722	62728	62701	62701	He	101	“ A few more days . ”
62729	62739	62740	62740	He	101	“ I ’ve given you a few more days . ”
62747	62755	62740	62740	He	101	“ You want to work it off ? ”
62756	62765	62766	62766	I	717	“ Do you have need of a baker ? ”
62770	62786	62766	62766	I	717	“ Does the baker know how to lie back and spread her legs real nice ? ”
62787	62790	62791	62791	Mia	511	“ Uh ! ”
62796	62803	62791	62791	Mia	511	“ She most certainly does not ! ”
62804	62822	62823	62823	he	101	“ Thousand a night , two guys per . Eight nights . It ’s a good deal , ”
62826	62835	62836	62836	Mia	511	“ She ’s not even thinking about it . ”
62843	62852	62853	62853	she	511	“ You ’re not even thinking about it , ”
62875	62886	62864	62864	Mia	511	“ You ’re not thinking about it , are you ? ”
62887	62894	62895	62895	I	717	“ You ’re a good friend , ”
62912	62930	62931	62931	she	511	“ Oh my god , it ’s after six . He ’s at the restaurant right now , ”
62934	62939	62940	62940	I	717	“ Oh , right , ”
62951	62964	62940	62940	I	717	“ Sitting there alone . I hope he feels like an idiot . ”
62965	62970	62971	62971	I	717	“ I hope so , ”
62974	62986	62987	62987	she	511	“ You ca n’t always get what you want , asshole , ”
62990	63004	63005	63005	I	717	“ He wants what he ca n’t have . He wants to win , ”
63008	63043	63005	63005	I	717	“ Just like Mason . Mason was always jealous of the bakery . And now Mr. Drummond is ruining my life because why ? Just because he can ? So done with jerky guys ! ”
63044	63068	63069	63069	I	717	“ You ’ll get through this , and you ’ll find a non - jerky guy . Not that you even need one . ”
63106	63115	63116	63116	she	1130	“ Here ’s what ’s amazing to me , ”
63119	63160	63116	63116	she	1130	“ They always show loan sharks on TV having an unnatural ability to count money just from flipping through the corner of the stack . And it turns out that that ’s a real thing ? Did you notice that ? ”
63161	63167	63168	63168	I	717	“ I know , right ? ”
63178	63221	63168	63168	I	717	“ Do they make them practice ? Is it part of an initiation ? Do they have to demonstrate that they have skills in accurately counting a stack of bills just by flipping through the corner and shooting somebody in the face ? ”
63222	63253	63259	63259	she	1130	“ And what if a guy has really good skills in shooting somebody in the face , but he ca n’t count the money like that ? Is he disqualified ? ”
63254	63258	63259	63259	she	1130	“ So weird , ”
63262	63274	63259	63259	she	1130	“ I ’m glad I at least got to wear it . ”
63275	63282	63168	63168	I	717	“ It looked beautiful on you . ”
63448	63460	63461	63461	I	717	“ We ’re going to sit on it for a while , ”
63750	63757	63739	63740	Mason West	90	“ pitches in with business expertise . ”
64014	64020	64021	64021	I	717	“ Wait here for me , ”
64026	64029	64030	64030	he	199	“ Sir , ”
64254	64257	64258	64258	I	717	“ Evening , ”
64280	64288	64289	64289	I	717	“ You have business with Ms. Cooper ? ”
64292	64297	64289	64289	I	717	“ You a cop ? ”
64298	64305	64306	64306	I	717	“ Just a friend of hers , ”
64309	64315	64316	64318	the one guy	1159	“ And we care why ? ”
64321	64351	64316	64318	the one guy	1159	“ I might be in the mood to clear it up , maybe save everyone a little trouble , if I can get a sense of what it is . ”
64352	64359	64360	64361	the one	1159	“ Maybe you ’re just nosy , ”
64364	64388	64360	64361	the one	1159	“ Maybe . Or maybe I handle this and you guys get to go out for wings and beer instead of sitting here . ”
64394	64403	64389	64390	The guys	1151	“ It ’s a money thing , right ? ”
64413	64423	64424	64425	The somebody	1161	“ Is there somebody I can see about it ? ”
64479	64486	64487	64487	Lenny	101	“ She a relative of yours ? ”
64490	64493	64487	64487	Lenny	101	“ Employee , ”
65069	65078	65079	65079	I	717	“ Yeah , you can just fuck off , ”
65095	65102	65087	65087	Palm	208	“ Open up . Come on . ”
65107	65113	65087	65087	Palm	208	“ We need to talk . ”
65114	65134	65135	65135	He	986	“ You need to stop sniffing chemical fumes if you think I ’m ever going to talk to you . ”
65146	65152	65135	65135	He	986	“ Open up . Please . ”
65153	65156	65087	65087	Palm	208	“ Why ? ”
65157	65168	65087	65087	Palm	208	“ Because we ca n’t have this conversation like this . ”
65169	65181	65135	65135	He	986	“ We already had it . That was our entire conversation . ”
65182	65187	65188	65188	he	986	“ Just open it , ”
65191	65207	65188	65188	he	986	“ You think you ’re still the boss of me ? I can not even … ”
65208	65211	65135	65135	He	986	“ Seven … ”
65212	65230	65087	65087	Palm	208	“ Oh my god ! You do n’t get to call me that . Seven is dead . ”
65239	65244	65233	65233	I	717	“ You killed her ! ”
65319	65323	65324	65324	I	717	“ News flash , ”
65328	65395	65396	65396	He	986	“ you do n’t get to order me around ever again . And if you think we ’re going to fuck right now — or ever — after you told Sasha every intimate detail of our phone calls . After you told her to fire me ? Being that you did n’t even have the courage to do it yourself ? Soooooo not gon na happen . ”
65401	65420	65396	65396	He	986	“ You think I told Sasha about what we said ... and then told her to fire you … ”
65421	65438	65439	65439	He	986	“ Unless Sasha ’s psychic . Because she seemed to know a whole lot of details . ”
65512	65520	65521	65521	He	986	“ You think you ’re staying now ? ”
65527	65534	65521	65521	He	986	“ I thought it was her . ”
65535	65538	65521	65521	He	986	“ What ? ”
65539	65549	65553	65553	Sasha	711	“ I thought Sasha was you — the caller . ”
65555	65566	65567	65567	he	986	“ The Hello Morning emails were coming from inside Vossameer , ”
65570	65597	65567	65567	he	986	“ I confronted her , and she more or less confessed that she was Operator Seven . And … she inferred a lot from our conversation . ”
65598	65601	65602	65602	I	717	“ Wait . ”
65607	65618	65619	65619	He	986	“ Sasha pretended to be me ? To your face ? ”
65634	65667	65619	65619	He	986	“ I would n’t have told anybody about our calls . And please believe that I did not tell her to fire you . It ’s the last thing I ’d want . ”
65668	65671	65672	65672	My	717	“ Oh . ”
65676	65687	65688	65688	he	986	“ That ’s not the kind of man I am , ”
65691	65704	65688	65688	he	986	“ I did n’t even know it was you until this morning . ”
65724	65739	65709	65709	I	717	“ When Sasha fired me , she pumped me for all sorts of information . ”
65740	65756	65757	65757	I	717	“ I figured . She seemed to know a lot . Jackalope , for instance . ”
65763	65771	65757	65757	I	717	“ You thought Sasha was Operator Seven . ”
65772	65777	65778	65778	He	986	“ Not for long . ”
65804	65811	65799	65799	He	986	“ She could never be you . ”
65818	65821	65822	65822	I	717	“ Oh , ”
65825	65831	65822	65822	I	717	“ Nobody could be you . ”
65857	65864	65865	65865	he	986	“ I invited her to dinner , ”
65868	65901	65865	65865	he	986	“ I was already suspicious , but when she told me she did n’t care for dessert , I knew for sure . And then I discovered her favorite musical is Grease . ”
65902	65910	65911	65911	He	986	“ I would ’ve expected 101 Dalmatians . ”
65935	65948	65932	65932	I	717	“ You should ’ve known the minute she said yes to dinner . ”
65949	65961	65962	65962	he	986	“ I should ’ve known before that — way before that , ”
65965	65983	65932	65932	I	717	“ They told me you quit . That you stormed out , saying how much Vossameer sucks . ”
65984	65999	65932	65932	I	717	“ Well , I did say that . But I sure did n’t quit . ”
66000	66010	66013	66013	me	717	“ Because you needed the bonus . For Lenny . ”
66018	66026	66013	66013	me	717	“ How do you know about that ? ”
66027	66051	65932	65932	I	717	“ I had a conversation with those guys out there . They ’re gone , by the way . The debt is settled . ”
66052	66063	65932	65932	I	717	“ Wait — what ? They ’re not coming back ? ”
66064	66072	66013	66013	me	717	“ No . The debt is handled . ”
66073	66080	66081	66081	His	986	“ Did you … handle it ? ”
66085	66100	66081	66081	His	986	“ Seems I owed you money . You ’ll get the rest , too . ”
66101	66105	66106	66106	I	717	“ Thank you , ”
66109	66122	66106	66106	I	717	“ Really . Thank you . And , um , the dress — ”
66123	66128	66129	66129	he	986	“ Forget the dress , ”
66132	66141	66129	66129	he	986	“ I do n’t care about the dress . ”
66149	66154	66155	66155	His	986	“ Oh … okay . ”
66175	66194	66171	66171	he	986	“ That ’s not what I care about , Seven . That ’s not why I ’m here . ”
66281	66288	66289	66289	I	717	“ What do you care about ? ”
66344	66367	66341	66341	He	717	“ I care about the way I felt when I was talking to you . I liked the way we felt together . ”
66368	66375	66376	66376	I	717	“ I liked it , too , ”
66428	66437	66462	66462	He	717	“ It ’s not how I usually am . ”
66438	66453	66462	66462	He	717	“ You ’re not usually like that ? Savagely ripping women ’s clothes off ? ”
66500	66511	66512	66512	he	986	“ Not usually . But everything ’s different with you , ”
66543	66560	66535	66535	his	986	“ Everything with you was real and true in a way I never had . New . ”
66561	66566	66567	66567	I	717	“ Me , too , ”
66570	66574	66567	66567	I	717	“ With you . ”
66650	66662	66636	66636	him	986	“ I would ’ve moved heaven and Earth to find you . ”
66663	66673	66679	66679	he	986	“ I ca n’t believe that Sasha tried to … ”
66784	66821	66781	66781	He	986	“ Everything with you feels like a new discovery . Not of lands or continents , but something more . What it ’s like to connect . What it ’s like to want somebody so bad … ”
66822	66832	66833	66833	I	717	“ So bad that you rip off her clothes , ”
66836	66845	66833	66833	I	717	“ Because you need her pussy so bad … ”
66846	66850	66851	66851	he	986	“ So bad , ”
66902	66909	66910	66910	I	717	“ You rip off her clothes , ”
66913	66916	66917	66917	he	986	“ Yeah ? ”
66925	66962	66917	66917	he	986	“ So desperate . And you haul her over your shoulder and carry her to her bedroom . And you throw her down there . You do n’t even care , you just throw her down . ”
66968	66973	66963	66963	I	717	“ like a brute . ”
67036	67042	67043	67043	I	717	“ You totally ravish her , ”
67093	67098	67099	67099	I	717	“ God , Drummond , ”
67102	67115	67099	67099	I	717	“ you need to rip off my clothes and fuck me already . ”
67244	67254	67255	67255	I	717	“ Oh my god , I love this already , ”
67438	67441	67442	67442	I	717	“ Yes , ”
67515	67522	67523	67523	he	77	“ Fuck , you ’re wet , ”
67526	67535	67523	67523	he	77	“ I ’m gon na come right now , ”
67539	67543	67536	67536	I	717	“ Not yet . ”
67793	67805	67806	67806	he	77	“ I like you like this , perfectly naked to me , ”
67819	67827	67809	67809	He	77	“ Every inch of you is hot . ”
67847	67861	67862	67862	He	77	“ Look at you , so naked and wet . Waiting for me . ”
67874	67882	67862	67862	He	77	“ Waiting for me to take you . ”
67883	67886	67887	67887	I	717	“ More , ”
67946	67949	67934	67934	he	77	“ Mine . ”
68043	68047	68048	68048	he	986	“ Suck it , ”
68057	68069	68048	68048	he	986	“ Show me how you ’re going to suck my cock . ”
68108	68112	68113	68113	he	986	“ I know , ”
68117	68126	68113	68113	he	986	“ But I ’ll make it so good . ”
68331	68335	68336	68336	I	717	“ Holy shit , ”
68377	68381	68382	68382	I	717	“ Do anything , ”
68385	68389	68390	68390	I	717	“ Or everything . ”
68436	68442	68427	68427	He	986	“ I can’t … not … ”
68443	68452	68453	68453	he	986	“ Do it , then ; do it , ”
68482	68487	68466	68466	He	986	“ Come , Seven . ”
68531	68534	68535	68535	I	717	“ Softer , ”
68592	68595	68596	68596	he	986	“ God , ”
68605	68608	68596	68596	he	986	“ God . ”
68619	68630	68616	68616	he	986	“ You are the most beautiful woman in the world . ”
68656	68659	68660	68660	He	986	“ Uhhh . ”
68680	68692	68660	68660	He	986	“ Is this where you call me ? From this bed ? ”
68693	68696	68697	68697	He	986	“ Yeah . ”
68712	68717	68718	68718	I	717	“ Lying right there ? ”
68724	68728	68729	68729	he	986	“ Touch yourself , ”
68733	68741	68729	68729	he	986	“ Like you do on the calls . ”
68742	68745	68751	68751	he	986	“ Drummond … ”
68746	68750	68751	68751	he	986	“ Go ahead , ”
68754	68761	68751	68751	he	986	“ It ’s kind of soon . ”
68762	68767	68768	68770	Tyrannical Mr. Drummond	213	“ Do it anyway . ”
68796	68804	68791	68791	I	717	“ Is that part of the fantasy ? ”
68805	68810	68811	68811	he	986	“ Are you kidding ? ”
68814	68842	68843	68843	He	986	“ I only wake up in the middle of the night imagining it . Or in the middle of reviewing data . Working on the new formula . ”
68892	68898	68899	68899	he	986	“ Do you imagine it ? ”
68902	68906	68899	68899	he	986	“ Me here ? ”
68907	68910	68899	68899	he	986	“ Yeah . ”
68911	68917	68899	68899	he	986	“ What do I do ? ”
68918	68934	68935	68935	He	986	“ You burst in and discover me , and you ’re so stern and angry . ”
68972	68975	68963	68963	He	986	“ Wider . ”
68981	68985	68986	68986	I	717	“ So presumptuous , ”
69034	69038	69039	69039	I	717	“ What else ? ”
69060	69097	69039	69039	I	717	“ You ’re so feverish to get to my pussy that you ’re savage — worshipful , but feral . And sometimes you bite me a little bit . And you sometimes wear your lab coat . ”
69098	69103	69104	69104	His	986	“ My lab coat . ”
69119	69126	69109	69109	His	986	“ That ’s what I wear ? ”
69127	69132	69039	69039	I	717	“ W - what ? ”
69133	69146	69109	69109	His	986	“ Focus . You like to imagine me wearing my lab coat ? ”
69147	69150	69151	69151	I	717	“ Sometimes , ”
69185	69188	69163	69163	He	986	“ And ? ”
69205	69218	69197	69197	he	986	“ And I drive you so crazy , you ca n’t even . ”
69219	69230	69231	69231	he	986	“ You think it ’s funny to drive me crazy ? ”
69256	69269	69270	69270	I	717	“ No , I do n’t think it ’s funny at all , ”
69273	69281	69282	69282	He	986	“ I think it ’s fucking hilarious . ”
69357	69368	69348	69348	He	986	“ You think it ’s hilarious ? To torment me ? ”
69390	69393	69394	69394	I	717	“ Very , ”
69479	69488	69489	69489	he	986	“ I should take you over my knee , ”
69516	69519	69489	69489	he	986	“ Well , ”
69523	69526	69520	69520	I	717	“ Uhh … ”
69583	69588	69589	69589	I	717	“ God , yes , ”
69789	69792	69793	69793	I	717	“ Seven , ”
69796	69803	69804	69804	She	711	“ Seven , Seven , Seven . ”
69817	69820	69821	69821	she	711	“ Yes , ”
69892	69895	69896	69896	she	711	“ Aagh , ”
69899	69903	69896	69896	she	711	“ You remembered . ”
69933	69940	69930	69930	She	711	“ Yes . More . Yesssss . ”
70102	70105	70106	70106	she	711	“ Yes , ”
70184	70188	70189	70189	she	717	“ So good , ”
70192	70198	70189	70189	she	717	“ I know , baby . ”
70237	70239	70235	70235	she	717	“ yesss ”
70554	70562	70563	70563	I	717	“ How did I not see you ? ”
70572	70583	70566	70566	She	717	“ Umm … it starts with an ‘ O ’ … ”
70584	70589	70590	70590	I	717	“ I mean it , ”
70593	70600	70590	70590	I	717	“ I did n’t see you . ”
70601	70609	70566	70566	She	717	“ I did n’t want you to . ”
70610	70614	70615	70615	She	717	“ Why not ? ”
70622	70662	70615	70615	She	717	“ Okay , more like , I did n’t want Sasha to see you see me . I was trying to keep my head down . Do the work , earn the bonus . Pass GO and all that . ”
70663	70673	70674	70674	She	717	“ I ’m going to take care of Sasha . ”
70682	70746	70674	70674	She	717	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m about to say this , but Sasha works her ass off for you . She ’s like a million percent Team Vossameer . I do n’t know if you should let her go . Why do n’t you try praising her once in a while ? That would make her feel more secure and less psycho . ”
70747	70756	70674	70674	She	717	“ I pay her a lot of money . ”
70757	70763	70674	70674	She	717	“ That ’s not praise . ”
70764	70769	70674	70674	She	717	“ I praise her . ”
70770	70775	70776	70776	I	717	“ You grunt approvingly . ”
70787	70792	70776	70776	I	717	“ She impersonated you . ”
70793	70798	70799	70799	she	1224	“ Well , yeah , ”
70817	70871	70806	70806	I	717	“ When she was first claiming to be you , but not being like you , I wanted to shake her . I wanted to say , ‘ It ’s me ! ’ Because everything felt off . But a scientist does n’t ignore evidence just because he does n’t like the result . ”
70872	70883	70884	70884	I	717	“ I ca n’t believe she does n’t like dessert . ”
70947	70954	70937	70937	I	717	“ Those dresses you were wearing . ”
70955	70958	70959	70959	She	71	“ Fake . ”
70962	70968	70959	70959	She	71	“ You are too easy . ”
70975	70989	70990	70990	I	717	“ I thought you destroyed your phone . The last time I called , ”
70993	71010	71011	71011	She	71	“ Yeah , and it was awesome . Except I had to get a new one . ”
71021	71028	71029	71029	She	71	“ I have to grab this . ”
71038	71041	71042	71042	she	71	“ Hey , ”
71072	71078	71079	71079	she	71	“ It ’s all good , ”
71086	71103	71104	71104	She	71	“ Lenny is handled , and his dogs are off . Yeah , I swear it ! ”
71135	71159	71127	71127	She	71	“ No , Mr. Drummond gave me my bonus after all … I know , right ? Oh yeah , and it was … ”
71183	71190	71177	71177	My	717	“ The bonus was … adequate . ”
71212	71231	71232	71232	she	71	“ Yes , I have company . You ’ve never met him . But you can come back , ”
71335	71345	71346	71346	she	71	“ Well , the bolt is off , anyway , ”
71373	71378	71359	71359	I	717	“ Lose the caller . ”
71385	71388	71389	71389	she	71	“ Nothing , ”
71392	71397	71398	71398	I	717	“ That was nothing . ”
71600	71603	71604	71604	she	71	“ What ? ”
71610	71615	71604	71604	she	71	“ Ahhhh , okay . ”
71672	71677	71678	71678	she	71	“ Got ta go , ”
71681	71686	71687	71687	she	71	“ Okay , okay , ”
71777	71782	71783	71783	she	71	“ Okay , later … ”
71824	71827	71838	71838	she	71	“ OmigodfuckYES . ”
71845	71851	71838	71838	she	71	“ Wake up , motherfucker . ”
71902	71907	71893	71893	She	71	“ What the hell ? ”
71919	71928	71908	71908	I	717	“ It ’s a little thing called morning . ”
71993	71998	71999	71999	she	71	“ Black . Right ? ”
72002	72010	71999	71999	she	71	“ When you ’re not drinking bulletproof ? ”
72011	72020	72021	72021	She	71	“ How ’d you know I drank bulletproof ? ”
72049	72055	72056	72056	I	717	“ Are you going somewhere ? ”
72059	72062	72063	72063	she	71	“ Out , ”
72073	72079	72067	72067	I	717	“ Come back to bed . ”
72080	72087	72088	72088	she	71	“ What ? I ca n’t , ”
72091	72110	72088	72088	she	71	“ This was great , but … it ca n’t be . This ca n’t be a thing . ”
72139	72152	72153	72153	She	71	“ Come out to breakfast . You have to eat , right ? ”
72157	72165	72153	72153	She	71	“ I do n’t know about that . ”
72166	72175	72176	72176	I	717	“ It ’s breakfast , not a date , ”
72179	72187	72176	72176	I	717	“ It just really ca n’t happen . ”
72218	72230	72231	72231	I	717	“ If you rip this shirt , I swear to god … ”
72240	72263	72264	72264	I	717	“ I ’m serious . Dates are off the table with me . I ca n’t do a relationship of any kind . ”
72272	72278	72279	72279	she	71	“ I ’m off guys , ”
72282	72308	72279	72279	she	71	“ You do n’t seem like you ’re off guys . In fact , you were quite recently on a guy , if memory serves . ”
72314	72320	72279	72279	she	71	“ And around a guy . ”
72321	72330	72331	72331	I	717	“ And I ’m moving in three weeks . ”
72334	72338	72331	72331	I	717	“ Three weeks ? ”
72339	72347	72348	72348	You	1239	“ I ’m moving back to Fargo . ”
72408	72412	72403	72403	We	1240	“ Why move ? ”
72413	72423	72387	72387	she	71	“ To get back on my feet . Financially . ”
72442	72457	72435	72435	I	717	“ It ’s just breakfast . And you know you ca n’t resist me . ”
72470	72478	72458	72458	Her	71	“ And I do n’t do relationships . ”
72479	72492	72493	72493	I	717	“ Forget relationships . This is nothing but proximity to food supply , ”
72496	72519	72520	72520	She	71	“ Satisfying my animal needs . Using you for your smoking - hot body . Do you have a problem with that ? ”
72557	72564	72565	72565	I	717	“ No commitment . No expectations , ”
72650	72662	72663	72663	She	342	“ You ’re just my wake - up - call girl . ”
72679	72685	72675	72675	She	342	“ Everybody needs to eat . ”
72724	72741	72716	72716	I	717	“ Everybody needs to fuck . And you know I ’m the best you ’ve had . ”
72742	72747	72748	72748	she	342	“ Jay - zuss , ”
72773	72786	72787	72787	Her	342	“ And you have n’t gotten your spanking you so richly deserve . ”
72824	72845	72813	72813	I	717	“ Fuck buddies only . Three - week fuck buddies . Nothing to lose with a hard stop like that . ”
72846	72854	72855	72855	she	342	“ I do n’t know , Drummond , ”
72881	72884	72885	72885	I	717	“ Theo , ”
72888	72892	72893	72893	I	717	“ Say it . ”
72905	72911	72893	72893	I	717	“ You ’re playing dirty . ”
72912	72916	72917	72917	She	342	“ I know . ”
72922	72929	72930	72930	she	342	“ Three - week fuck buddies , ”
72933	72968	72930	72930	she	342	“ And you wo n’t try to control me or get involved in my business in any way . You do n’t meddle in my life . And no more home visits like this . ”
73020	73029	73015	73015	anybody	705	“ I ’ll stay away from your business . ”
73081	73085	73086	73086	she	342	“ Just sex , ”
73089	73094	73095	73095	I	717	“ Pure animal need , ”
73292	73302	73303	73303	I	717	“ This place opens at five in the morning , ”
73306	73324	73303	73303	I	717	“ Is this where you go ? After you get your obnoxiously early wake - up call ? ”
73325	73332	73303	73303	I	717	“ No , I work out . ”
73333	73347	73352	73352	he	1152	“ At 4:30 ? Like it ca n’t wait until a human hour ? ”
73348	73351	73352	73352	he	1152	“ Nope , ”
73402	73407	73388	73389	A waiter	1013	“ What is this ? ”
73424	73430	73411	73412	The waiter	1013	“ Do you have sugar ? ”
73431	73438	73439	73439	he	1152	“ I ’m sorry , no , ”
73458	73470	73442	73442	I	717	“ You go to a place that does n’t serve sugar . ”
73471	73478	73479	73479	Theo	1152	“ Sugar ’s bad for you , ”
73482	73492	73493	73493	He	1152	“ Sugar is part of the circle of life . ”
73535	73547	73493	73493	He	1152	“ So , then you come here ? After your workout ? ”
73548	73568	73569	73569	I	717	“ No . This is special for you . But do n’t worry , it ’s not a relationship . ”
73604	73619	73620	73620	he	1152	“ I want you to know , you really can have your job back , ”
73623	73648	73620	73620	he	1152	“ Or if you do n’t want to work at Vossameer , I could help you get a job elsewhere . I have connections … ”
73649	73692	73620	73620	he	1152	“ That ’s okay . I ’m going to find some catering work while I get ready to move . I have a lot of catering friends . To be honest , I was going to quit after my bonus came through . ”
73693	73702	73620	73620	he	1152	“ You were using us for the bonus ? ”
73703	73708	73709	73709	I	717	“ I earned it , ”
73712	73739	73709	73709	I	717	“ My engagement numbers blew away your targets . I set you guys up with a great program . Of course it was an impressive bonus . ”
73747	73754	73740	73740	I	717	“ Far more than I expected . ”
73755	73762	73740	73740	I	717	“ I like my employees satisfied . ”
73763	73771	73772	73772	I	717	“ I like a boss who delivers , ”
73790	73802	73803	73803	He	717	“ The Instagram strategy . All those reports . Tell me . ”
73807	73823	73803	73803	He	717	“ It was yours , was n’t it ? Everything that Sasha took credit for ? ”
73824	73840	73841	73841	He	717	“ Not all of it . She did all those whitepapers . Like a demon . ”
73855	73884	73847	73847	I	717	“ Dude , people take credit for underlings ’ work at Vossameer all the time . It ’s a grim and competitive atmosphere . It ’s not good . ”
73885	73904	73803	73803	He	717	“ The people who are attracted to Vossameer are competitive . They ’re the best of the best . ”
73905	73946	73947	73947	He	717	“ I have a perspective from the bottom rung . I ’m telling you . People are uptight and unhappy . They admire you in a kind of frightened way , and it keeps them from being relaxed and creative . ”
73951	73958	73947	73947	He	717	“ You think they ’re unhappy ? ”
73968	73988	73947	73947	He	717	“ I know they are . You ban decorations , and even microwave popcorn . People love microwave popcorn ! ”
73989	74020	73847	73847	I	717	“ Microwave popcorn is a ridiculous food . It has zero nutritional value and barely even any taste . It ’s like eating smell . And it distracts everyone else . ”
74021	74036	73947	73947	He	717	“ Yeah , well people love it . Why not let them have it ? ”
74037	74045	73947	73947	He	717	“ I ’m not running a circus . ”
74046	74059	74060	74060	I	717	“ Is n’t a scientist supposed to be open to new evidence ? ”
74063	74132	74133	74133	He	1265	“ You need to do something to help people feel more loose and easy . I do n’t know , praise them more . Let them have treats . Find ways to encourage them to be creative . Show they ’re appreciated , make them feel more secure so they do n’t have to work so late . You could make it so much better to work there . ”
74141	74167	74168	74168	I	717	“ And while you ’re at it , get some color in there . Let people make it homey . Let them put pictures up . ”
74171	74203	74204	74204	He	1265	“ I ’m coloring outside the fuck buddy lines . I think it ’s the lack of sugar . It ’s amazing coffee , too , but so sad without sugar . ”
74217	74224	74225	74225	I	717	“ But that microwave popcorn ban ? ”
74236	74252	74253	74253	I	717	“ No . If I were you , I ’d supply them with awesome treats . ”
74257	74264	74253	74253	I	717	“ This coffee is a crime . ”
74265	74272	74214	74214	his	1265	“ We could go somewhere else . ”
74273	74278	74279	74279	I	717	“ No , just … ”
74307	74314	74253	74253	I	717	“ Excuse me for one second . ”
74315	74321	74214	74214	his	1265	“ Where are you going ? ”
74322	74325	74326	74326	I	717	“ BRB . ”
74363	74370	74371	74371	he	717	“ What the hell is that ? ”
74374	74381	74371	74371	he	717	“ You know what it is . ”
74426	74429	74430	74430	He	717	“ Heaven . ”
74435	74439	74430	74430	He	717	“ Want some ? ”
74440	74444	74430	74430	He	717	“ Absolutely not . ”
74445	74452	74430	74430	He	717	“ Is your body a temple ? ”
74453	74466	74467	74467	he	717	“ I think I showed you the answer to that this morning , ”
74495	74510	74485	74485	I	717	“ You should bring this home with you . I think you need it . ”
74511	74528	74430	74430	He	717	“ You ’re really moving to Fargo ? Are you sure that’s … what you want ? ”
74529	74591	74485	74485	I	717	“ No , it ’s not what I want . Certain events caused my financial ruination , and it ’s hard to dig out of something like that in Manhattan . I ’m only going for eighteen months . I ’ll help my parents with the pizzeria , and I ’ll do catering through one graduation season and two holiday seasons . ”
74592	74601	74485	74485	I	717	“ So you have it all figured out . ”
74602	74677	74430	74430	He	717	“ Yeah . I can work like a devil there , and I ’ll make bank with no overhead . I know exactly how much I can make . I ’ll restructure my debt and come back with seed money to open a bakery here . Like I had before , but better . It ’s not like anyone is going to rent a good space to me , what with my credit now . ”
74678	74695	74485	74485	I	717	“ What if they do ? What if the most amazing space falls into your lap ? ”

79293	79299	79290	79290	he	1152	“ And I ca n’t . ”
79300	79309	79352	79352	I	717	“ Why is it so important to dehydrate ? ”
79310	79351	79352	79352	I	717	“ It makes it portable . It could be issued to soldiers . Cops . Schools . Put in first - aid kits . It would be huge for gunshot victims . I should ’ve had it nailed by now . ”
79369	79379	79352	79352	I	717	“ Is there some kind of rush on it ? ”
79380	79385	79386	79386	he	1152	“ Besides people dying ? ”
79389	79395	79396	79396	I	717	“ Right , of course , ”

79580	79593	79551	79551	I	717	“ Things wo n’t be okay if I do n’t get it . ”
79594	79625	79551	79551	I	717	“ Why ? I understand that it would be great if you solved it . But there are other chemists in the world . Maybe they could take a crack . ”
79626	79637	79638	79638	he	1152	“ I ’m the one on the trail of it , ”
79641	79656	79551	79551	I	717	“ And people need it . People are dying for the lack of it . ”
79657	79660	79661	79661	I	717	“ Okay . ”

79717	79742	79706	79706	I	717	“ Well , you invented the other formula . So it ’s not like you ’re some slacker in the saving - lives department . ”
79743	79777	79778	79778	I	717	“ Tell that to the people who die for a lack of the dehydrated version . It drives me crazy , because I know it ’s there . Just out of my reach . ”
79811	79820	79821	79821	He	1152	“ Who ’s the hero now , biotches ? ”
79824	79831	79821	79821	He	1152	“ What did you just say ? ”
79832	79839	79840	79840	I	717	“ You heard what I said , ”
79854	79859	79843	79843	He	1152	“ You are terrible . ”
79860	79877	79878	79878	He	1152	“ What , you ’re wounded ? Maybe you should ’ve tried not to get wounded . ”
79895	79905	79906	79906	I	717	“ I ca n’t believe you just said that . ”
79912	79924	79927	79927	he	1152	“ You should ’ve tried not to get wounded ? Jesus . ”
79940	79943	79944	79944	he	1152	“ Uh , ”
80153	80156	80157	80157	he	1152	“ Okay , ”
80344	80361	80362	80362	I	717	“ We did n’t have much money , but we were together in a fierce way , ”
80365	80413	80362	80362	I	717	“ March twenty - first . We ’d eat all our favorite foods and do our favorite activities . No matter what day of the week it fell on , Mom and Dad would take off work . Sometimes they ’d get me out of school early . ”
80414	80420	80421	80421	he	717	“ It ’s coming up , ”
80424	80437	80421	80421	he	717	“ I know . I ’m going to miss it this year . ”
80467	80517	80518	80518	He	717	“ This space was for rent a few weeks back . I know they would never rent it to me with my credit , but I had to see it . Look at it . There ’s a restaurant going in now , but look at the tin ceiling . ”
80533	80550	80527	80527	He	717	“ Why would you go and see it if you know you can never have it ? ”
80551	80558	80559	80559	I	717	“ You ’re gon na laugh , ”
80570	80575	80562	80562	He	717	“ This is me . ”
80587	80594	80595	80595	I	717	“ I have a dream board , ”
80598	80608	80609	80609	He	717	“ I know you ’re a scientist and everything — ”
80617	80627	80609	80609	He	717	“ You put the image on your dream board . ”
80628	80689	80690	80690	He	717	“ Yeah . I feel like it helps to have pictures of what I want . Though to be my ideal space , it would have to be on a corner . And really small and cozy like my old space . I would have one table outside , but none inside . I have a whole rationale about it . ”
80729	80734	80735	80735	I	717	“ I should go , ”
81344	81357	81340	81340	His	1152	“ Let ’s figure this out . We can make this work . ”
81400	81412	81395	81395	I	717	“ Do n’t do that . Do n’t send me these . ”
81413	81420	81395	81395	I	717	“ It ’s the perfect space . ”
81421	81445	81395	81395	I	717	“ The perfect space they ’d never rent to me . And I could n’t afford it even if they did say yes . ”
81446	81457	81395	81395	I	717	“ You could afford it if I invested . Cosigned . ”
81458	81489	81395	81395	I	717	“ You mean if I let you be my sugar daddy and rent it for me ? And then you ’d be able to take it away on a whim ? ”
81490	81497	81395	81395	I	717	“ I would n’t do that . ”
81498	81501	81395	81395	I	717	“ Theo — ”
81502	81516	81395	81395	I	717	“ It ’s ridiculous to move away when you do n’t have to . ”
81517	81525	81526	81526	I	717	“ It ’s not ridiculous to me , ”
81529	81583	81584	81584	He	717	“ Do you not understand why I need to do this on my own ? However you dress it up , this plan would give you power over my existence . I know it seems unreasonable to you , but I want you to respect it ’s a thing with me . Okay ? ”
81587	81597	81598	81598	He	717	“ Do n’t show me any more real estate . ”
81604	81615	81616	81616	I	717	“ I wo n’t show you any more real estate . ”
81734	81746	81747	81747	I	717	“ what the hell are you doing in my hotel room ? ”
82113	82118	82119	82119	Derek	199	“ I ’m sorry , ”
82122	82129	82130	82130	Theo	1152	“ There was construction over on … ”
82139	82144	82130	82130	Theo	1152	“ Ask next time . ”
82145	82151	82107	82107	he	1152	“ I really am sorry . ”
82152	82160	82130	82130	Theo	1152	“ It ’s fine . Next time ... ”
82161	82164	82165	82165	Derek	199	“ Absolutely , ”
82173	82178	82179	82179	I	717	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
82190	82201	82182	82182	He	1152	“ That would be out of the fuck buddies purview . ”
82202	82205	82206	82206	I	717	“ Theo , ”
82327	82337	82338	82338	he	1152	“ The spot they went through is back there , ”
82342	82366	82338	82338	he	1152	“ All this metal , and he managed to find the one loose part , the one damaged part , to blast through . ”
82399	82409	82393	82393	He	1152	“ Screw it . Okay . Okay , then . ”
82410	82413	82414	82414	I	717	“ What ? ”
82422	82434	82417	82417	He	1152	“ Take us down to the water once you ’re off . ”
82435	82439	82440	82440	Derek	199	“ Will do , ”
82443	82449	82440	82440	Derek	199	“ Down to the water ? ”
82458	82465	82466	82466	he	1152	“ We ’ve come this far , ”
82556	82560	82540	82540	He	1152	“ Come on . ”
82771	82784	82785	82785	He	1152	“ I did n’t take you here to feel sorry for me . ”
82793	82797	82798	82798	I	717	“ I know , ”
82809	82837	82801	82801	He	1152	“ See the third section ? And how the bridge is darker right down from it ? That ’s the repaired part . You can still tell . ”
82838	82847	82798	82798	I	717	“ Where they went off . The accident . ”
82855	82874	82875	82875	I	717	“ It was n’t so much an accident , really . Accidents are unexpected . This was inevitable . ”
82880	82890	82891	82891	he	1152	“ You could see it coming from miles away , ”
82894	82977	82891	82891	he	1152	“ My dad , the world ’s most high - functioning drunk . He kept a good job . Managed to handle his responsibilities , but could n’t resist driving . He just loved to drive us around . I do n’t know what the hell was in his head . It especially terrified Willow . She ’d cry when he ’d make her ride . He saw it as a criticism , and he ’d just do it all the more . ”
83020	83032	83033	83033	he	1152	“ That ’s why Willow worked so hard for those scholarships , ”
83036	83111	83033	83033	he	1152	“ I mean , she was in her bedroom programming from morning to night when other girls were doing whatever girls that age are supposed to do . It was her ticket out . The shit he ’d say . Those terrifying rides . Willow and I always hated rides at the fair . Roller coasters . That type of thrill was never fun for us . We had the real - life version . ”
83112	83116	83117	83117	I	717	“ Sounds like , ”
83143	83204	83205	83205	He	228	“ When I was fifteen , I started standing up to him and taking away the keys . I ’d refuse to ride . Refuse to let Mom ride . Sometimes hide the keys and just take what came . But he was still a lot bigger than me . I could sometimes stop the rides , but not always . ”
83241	83376	83377	83377	He	1379	“ At one point , Dad went out of town on a business trip , and it was just Mom and me . We were out of his orbit long enough that we felt what it was like to be free of his power . I had my mom talked into leaving . It was going to be just us . Build our own life . I had enough savings for a place in Queens . A sad little studio in a piece - of - shit building , but it would ’ve been ours . I really thought I had her on board , but then he came home , and nothing changed . Except the fights over the keys got worse . Finally I left . I managed to get a job . ”
83401	83416	83417	83417	He	1379	“ I was so damn angry . At him , but also at her . ”
83430	83477	83417	83417	He	1379	“ I glowered at her as I left , angry that she was too weak to come along . That was the last time I saw her . Because she was too weak to take the keys away from him herself . And I knew that . ”
83478	83481	83574	83574	he	1898	“ Theo — ”
83482	83503	83417	83417	He	1379	“ That was my role . Getting the keys . It was how I kept the three of us alive . ”
83504	83523	83417	83417	He	1379	“ Like it was your fault ? She was an adult . She could ’ve taken the keys . ”
83533	83561	83417	83417	He	1379	“ In theory , yes . In reality , she could n’t have taken them any more than she could ’ve pole - vaulted over the house . ”
83562	83571	83574	83574	he	1898	“ So you think it ’s your fault ? ”
83592	83597	83417	83417	He	1379	“ It was inevitable . ”
83598	83604	83605	83605	I	717	“ That is such shit ! ”
83608	83626	83605	83605	I	717	“ It was her job to take away the keys . To be watching out for you . ”
83627	83633	83634	83634	he	1898	“ In a perfect world , ”
83637	83642	83643	83643	He	1898	“ In this world . ”
83647	83657	83643	83643	He	1898	“ What does Willow say ? Surely she agrees . ”
83658	83692	83605	83605	I	717	“ She does n’t know . I mean , she knows they went off . She knows I left , but she ’s never thought it through in terms of cause and effect . ”
83693	83707	83708	83708	He	1898	“ Maybe because there is n’t any cause and effect that involves you . ”
83750	83757	83741	83741	I	717	“ You should tell your sister . ”
83758	83778	83741	83741	I	717	“ I ’m not going to tell my sister . Especially now . She has problems of her own . ”
83779	83795	83796	83796	He	1898	“ You ca n’t carry it like this . You need to talk about it . ”
83804	83814	83796	83796	He	1898	“ Is n’t that what fuck buddies are for ? ”
83815	83820	83741	83741	I	717	“ No , actually . ”
83879	83902	83872	83872	he	1898	“ They always tell that story like I ’m a hero . You can see now why I ’m not a fan . ”
83903	83908	83909	83909	I	717	“ God , Theo . ”
83944	83957	83958	83958	I	717	“ I ’m going to come back to your place with you , ”
83961	83970	83958	83958	I	717	“ And make you some nice hot cocoa . ”
83971	83980	83958	83958	I	717	“ I do n’t want a pity visit . ”
83981	83994	83996	83996	I	717	“ It ’s not a pity visit . I just want to . ”
84019	84027	84028	84028	His	1898	“ You think you can stop me ? ”
84034	84037	84028	84028	His	1898	“ Yeah . ”
84038	84048	84049	84049	His	1898	“ You think you ’re the boss of me ? ”
84061	84070	84071	84071	he	1898	“ I do n’t have stuff for cocoa , ”
84075	84087	84088	84088	He	1898	“ I do . In my bag . From the caterers . ”
84107	84119	84088	84088	He	1898	“ You just want more of my savage and uncivilized loving . ”
84181	84186	84167	84168	Lizzie Theo	605	“ Which is yours ? ”
84297	84306	84307	84307	I	717	“ Do just you despise dry - cleaning ? ”
84314	84329	84307	84307	I	717	“ It ’s a tux for a ridiculous banquet . I despise ridiculous banquets . ”
84330	84336	84352	84352	He	1898	“ Too kumbayah for you ? ”
84337	84341	84307	84307	I	717	“ Pretty much . ”
84476	84496	84497	84497	He	1898	“ I ’ve never seen it from so high and near like this . The paths look even curvier . ”
84503	84519	84520	84520	he	1898	“ They made them like that so there would n’t be horse and carriage races , ”
84523	84530	84520	84520	he	1898	“ Does n’t slow the bikes . ”
84531	84534	84535	84535	he	1898	“ No , ”
84566	84575	84576	84576	I	717	“ You ca n’t blow off the banquet ? ”
84579	84599	84600	84600	He	1898	“ No . It ’s one of the hoops I have to jump through for the Locke Foundation partnership . ”
84617	84643	84600	84600	He	1898	“ They want to ensure that I ’m good in public . Not an asshole and all that . Apple pie and smiles for everyone . ”
84644	84657	84658	84658	He	1898	“ Oh , you are so apple pie and smiles for everyone . ”
84670	84680	84681	84681	he	1898	“ I can be when I have to be , ”
84687	84693	84681	84681	he	1898	“ When I want something . ”
84694	84703	84704	84704	He	1898	“ Because you always get what you want . ”
84759	84766	84767	84767	He	1898	“ What should we do now ? ”
84855	84865	84866	84866	I	717	“ Why do you even need Locke so bad ? ”
84877	84888	84889	84889	He	1898	“ You have wads of money and your own company . ”
84892	84907	84908	84908	he	1898	“ They have partnerships and trust built up with charitable organizations across the world , ”
84911	84941	84908	84908	he	1898	“ It ’s a lot less hassle to jump through their PR hoops than to set up my own network . Giving is actually more complicated than people think . ”
84942	84958	84908	84908	he	1898	“ Well , the Locke people should be grateful . That ’s what I think . ”
84959	84983	84908	84908	he	1898	“ They ’re into image . A strong image attracts the best people and makes them more effective . I can appreciate that . ”
84984	84993	84994	84994	I	717	“ You just do n’t want to bother , ”
84997	85000	85004	85004	his	1898	“ No . ”
85010	85025	85004	85004	his	1898	“ They ’d be especially grateful if I ’d worked out the new formula . ”
85026	85032	85033	85033	I	717	“ More gratitude , motherfuckers , ”
85047	85052	85053	85053	He	1898	“ Yeah , motherfuckers . ”
85104	85124	85098	85098	He	1898	“ This is my favorite freckle of yours . My second favorite is the one on your right thigh . ”
85131	85134	85125	85125	He	1898	“ Here . ”
85149	85157	85125	85125	He	1898	“ I never think about that one . ”
85158	85177	85178	85178	He	1898	“ I always do . And there ’s another one here at two o’clock from your belly button . ”
85202	85212	85213	85213	My	717	“ I like every place on you , Lizzie . ”
85242	85251	85252	85252	he	1898	“ I do n’t want you to leave , ”
85255	85258	85252	85252	he	1898	“ Theo — ”
85259	85263	85252	85252	he	1898	“ Please stay . ”
85264	85269	85252	85252	he	1898	“ It ’s impossible . ”
85270	85279	85252	85252	he	1898	“ Unless we decide to make it possible . ”
85280	85297	85252	85252	he	1898	“ Do n’t . We talked about this . You said you would n’t get involved . ”
85298	85310	85311	85311	he	1898	“ Maybe it ’s time for you to change your mind , ”
85314	85325	85326	85326	He	1898	“ I ca n’t change my mind on an emotion . ”
85333	85360	85361	85361	He	1898	“ Please respect that I need this to happen on my own steam . I need you to stop trying to change my mind on it . ”
85377	85388	85389	85389	He	1898	“ This is one of my favorite places on you . ”
85412	85452	85453	85453	He	1898	“ Your other one whorls perfectly , but this one refuses to whorl . It marches to its own drummer . It ’s something you do n’t see until you ’re really up close . A secret eyebrow rebellion . ”
85459	85467	85453	85453	He	1898	“ Do I need to quash it ? ”
85468	85471	85472	85472	I	717	“ Maybe , ”
85480	85493	85494	85494	I	717	“ Still there . You can glower and furrow all you want . ”
85498	85508	85509	85509	He	1898	“ You ’re not the boss of this eyebrow . ”
85514	85524	85525	85525	I	717	“ You think you ’re the boss of everything , ”
85671	85685	85655	85655	He	1898	“ Everything always has to go perfectly your way . Is that it ? ”
85686	85689	85690	85690	I	717	“ Yes , ”
85700	85710	85711	85711	He	1898	“ What are you going to do about it ? ”
85717	85723	85711	85711	He	1898	“ I think you know . ”
85906	85910	85911	85911	he	1898	“ Good morning , ”
85918	85922	85923	85923	I	717	“ Good morning , ”
85927	85930	85923	85923	I	717	“ Wow . ”
85931	85934	85911	85911	he	1898	“ What ? ”
85935	85942	85943	85943	I	717	“ Here it is , morning , ”
85946	85953	85954	85954	He	1898	“ How did that even happen ? ”
85973	85983	85969	85969	He	1898	“ An effect of my amazing , savage lovemaking — ”
86010	86018	86019	86019	I	717	“ What are you thinking , baby ? ”
86085	86107	86108	86108	I	717	“ I ’m trying to decide which microwave - popcorn - of - the - month subscription to order for you , ”
86111	86136	86137	86137	He	338	“ I ’ve narrowed it down to empty cheesy aroma or whiff - of - buttery - nothingness delight . What do you think ? ”
86493	86498	86489	86489	I	717	“ Get over here , ”
86608	86611	86612	86612	She	711	“ Now . ”
86648	86664	86665	86665	She	711	“ You ’re going to stay right here as long as I require your services . ”
86717	86722	86701	86701	I	717	“ You kept it ! ”
86736	86743	86701	86701	I	717	“ It has your phone number . ”
86752	86762	86701	86701	I	717	“ How the hell else would I call you ? ”
86785	86791	86792	86792	she	711	“ Do you have eggs ? ”
86795	86798	86792	86792	she	711	“ Veggies ? ”
86799	86802	86803	86803	I	717	“ Yeah . ”
86807	86824	86803	86803	I	717	“ I have eggs and veggies . But I do n’t have the stuff for breakfast . ”
86825	86838	86847	86847	She	711	“ You just listed the stuff I ’d need to make breakfast . ”
86839	86846	86847	86847	She	711	“ Not so sure about that . ”
86938	86942	86943	86943	she	711	“ Thank you , ”
86946	86950	86943	86943	she	711	“ For what ? ”
86951	86958	86959	86959	My	717	“ Telling me about the bridge . ”
86973	86994	86965	86965	She	711	“ And I accept the challenge . I ’m going to make an amazing breakfast for you . Right here . ”
87052	87064	87065	87065	She	711	“ You have no butter , no oil , no pan . ”
87075	87080	87065	87065	She	711	“ I told you . ”
87081	87094	87065	87065	She	711	“ What are you doing with the eggs ? Poaching them somehow ? ”
87095	87105	87065	87065	She	711	“ I thought you were the kitchen expert here . ”
87106	87117	87065	87065	She	711	“ Do you microwave water and poach them like that ? ”
87118	87124	87125	87125	I	717	“ You can do that ? ”
87133	87141	87128	87128	She	711	“ You ’re not hiding kitchen stuff ? ”
87142	87159	87065	87065	She	711	“ What ? No . This is all I have . Coffee maker and a blender . ”
87160	87181	87065	87065	She	711	“ Have you been throwing the eggs off the balcony at people ? Is that what you use them for ? ”
87182	87187	87188	87188	I	717	“ I blend them , ”
87191	87204	87188	87188	I	717	“ It all goes in the blender . Veggies . Raw eggs . ”
87205	87210	87128	87128	She	711	“ What ? Yuck . ”
87211	87219	87128	87128	She	711	“ Food is fuel . Not recreation . ”
87220	87240	87241	87241	She	711	“ Are you one of those people who would n’t eat at all if you did n’t have to ? ”
87247	87278	87241	87241	She	711	“ Do n’t answer that . God , at least you ’re consistent . What if you want meat ? Do n’t tell me you put that in the blender . ”
87279	87285	87286	87286	I	717	“ It ’s called restaurants , ”
87299	87308	87289	87289	She	711	“ You ’re hot when you ’re stymied . ”
87407	87413	87414	87414	I	717	“ Ordering is n’t fair , ”
87427	87431	87432	87432	she	711	“ I know , ”
87435	87457	87432	87432	she	711	“ But please . What you ’re doing ? It ’s like those pills that astronauts used to eat for food . ”
87458	87463	87387	87387	She	711	“ Astronauts are efficient . ”
87464	87482	87483	87483	she	711	“ Why do n’t you just feed yourself to the worms and get it all over with ? ”
87486	87494	87387	87387	She	711	“ That would be even more efficient . ”
87495	87512	87513	87513	I	717	“ Because I have things to do . I have to nail this deal with Locke , ”
87516	87525	87513	87513	I	717	“ I need to develop the dehydrated version . ”
87548	87558	87559	87559	she	711	“ We need to get you a few pans , ”
87562	87565	87559	87559	she	711	“ Jesus . ”
87638	87647	87648	87648	she	711	“ He does n’t have any basics whatsoever , ”
87657	87668	87669	87670	The woman	511	“ He does n’t even have a good egg pan . ”
87674	87683	87669	87670	The woman	511	“ A man needs a good egg pan . ”
87778	87782	87766	87766	She	511	“ For cookies . ”
87788	87793	87783	87783	I	717	“ In what universe ? ”
87799	87808	87794	87794	I	717	“ In what universe am I making cookies ? ”
87809	87818	87783	87783	I	717	“ Maybe you want to impress some date . ”
87861	87865	87866	87866	She	511	“ Or whatever . ”
87920	87962	87963	87963	She	511	“ Are you even planning on trying it on to see if the alterations worked ? Dude , you ’re going to be on a Jumbotron holding a Locke Award statue and making a speech . You ca n’t be all — ”
87971	87978	87979	87979	Willow	530	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . ”
88017	88020	88001	88001	She	530	“ Hi . ”
88071	88082	88083	88083	she	1430	“ Hi ! I ’m Willow , Theo ’s sister , ”
88116	88141	88110	88110	Lizzie	605	“ So the ridiculous banquet is for you ? For you to get the Locke Award ? The Locke Award is a big deal ! ”
88142	88148	88149	88149	Willow	530	“ I know , right ? ”
88154	88159	88160	88160	Lizzie	605	“ A ridiculous award ? ”
88165	88173	88174	88174	Willow	530	“ Is that what he called it ? ”
88181	88188	88189	88189	Lizzie	605	“ You ’re giving a speech , ”
88202	88211	88192	88192	I	717	“ And speeches will be given about you . ”
88212	88217	88218	88218	I	717	“ That ’s right , ”
88258	88266	88267	88267	Willow	530	“ It ’s a very huge honor , ”
88283	88288	88289	88289	Willow	530	“ I ’m off , ”
88292	88301	88289	88289	Willow	530	“ I came to drop a few things — ”
88302	88310	88311	88311	Lizzie	605	“ No , look at the time , ”
88314	88322	88323	88323	She	530	“ I have to go to work . ”
88331	88340	88341	88341	Willow	530	“ Please do n’t go on my account , ”
88344	88368	88369	88369	She	530	“ I really have to be at work . There are quiches to make . It was great to meet you , though . ”
88374	88380	88381	88381	she	530	“ Thanks for … breakfast , ”
88390	88397	88381	88381	she	530	“ I ’ll walk you out , ”
88431	88463	88426	88426	She	530	“ It ’s a huge honor . Even though I know you ’d rather get poked in the eye with a stick . Or have people sitting there flipping you off . ”
88464	88471	88426	88426	She	530	“ I would so prefer it . ”
88472	88477	88478	88478	I	717	“ You ’re terrible . ”
88495	88500	88501	88501	I	717	“ Come with me , ”
88504	88518	88501	88501	I	717	“ Be my date . Be the one there that flips me off . ”
88519	88526	88501	88501	I	717	“ I ca n’t , Theo . ”
88527	88535	88501	88501	I	717	“ Because of our fuck buddies thing ? ”
88536	88541	88501	88501	I	717	“ Um … yes ? ”
88542	88553	88554	88554	I	717	“ Screw it . You ’re leaving in two weeks . ”
88569	88577	88578	88578	She	530	“ Rules were made to be broken . ”
88588	88622	88578	88578	She	530	“ Come . It ’ll be a delicious dinner if nothing else — that ’s what everyone keeps telling me . They say Locke knows how to put out a damn fine spread . ”
88628	88649	88623	88623	I	717	“ There will probably be lavish desserts . And then you can sit in the audience and flip me off . ”
88664	88680	88681	88681	She	530	“ Be the one person who ’s with me , really , really with me . ”
88686	88689	88681	88681	She	530	“ Theo . ”
88690	88702	88712	88712	I	717	“ I ’ll get that Funny Face dress back for you . ”
88703	88711	88712	88712	I	717	“ Do n’t . You ca n’t . ”
88715	88724	88725	88725	She	530	“ You ’re not the boss of me . ”
88732	88738	88725	88725	She	530	“ It ca n’t happen . ”
88739	88743	88725	88725	She	530	“ Why not ? ”
88805	88810	88794	88794	Willow	530	“ What happened here ? ”
88811	88820	88821	88821	I	717	“ Apparently a man needs an egg pan , ”
88824	88833	88834	88834	She	530	“ And an egg pan needs an entourage . ”
88840	88850	88834	88834	She	530	“ I ’m so sorry I ran her off . ”
88851	88858	88794	88794	Willow	530	“ She would ’ve gone anyway . ”
88859	88864	88865	88865	Willow	530	“ I like her , ”
88868	88875	88865	88865	Willow	530	“ She actually gives you crap . ”
88876	88883	88834	88834	She	530	“ Is n’t that your job ? ”
88884	88908	88834	88834	She	530	“ You had her in your home . You let her take you shopping . Did you ask her to the Locke banquet ? ”
88909	88921	88922	88922	I	717	“ Are you trying to get out of being my date ? ”
88925	88931	88922	88922	I	717	“ Did you ask her ? ”
88932	88935	88936	88936	I	717	“ Yeah , ”
88939	88947	88936	88936	I	717	“ She does n’t want to go . ”
88948	88961	88966	88966	Willow	530	“ But you had her at your home . She seems so … ”
88962	88965	88966	88966	Willow	530	“ Perfect ? ”
88979	88982	88966	88966	Willow	530	“ Yeah . ”
88983	89010	89011	89011	I	717	“ She ’s coming off a bad experience . She ’s moving away in a couple of weeks . She just wants to be fuck buddies . ”
89044	89051	89035	89035	Willow	530	“ But you so want more . ”
89640	89650	89651	89651	Mia	511	“ Did you make microwave popcorn for him yet ? ”
89660	89671	89651	89651	Mia	511	“ You so need to do that before you leave . ”
89715	89728	89729	89729	I	717	“ We ’re not at that point in our fuck buddy relationship , ”
89790	89800	89801	89801	she	511	“ Yeah , fuck buddies . Whatever you say , ”
89809	89821	89801	89801	she	511	“ You know you ’re gon na go to that banquet . ”
89876	89891	89892	89892	I	717	“ I vowed I would n’t get wrapped up with a guy like him , ”
89911	89920	89921	89921	I	717	“ It ’s better for him , too , ”
89924	89948	89949	89949	She	511	“ He ’s been making great progress with his formula over the past week . He needs that mental bandwidth for his work . ”
89953	89956	89949	89949	She	511	“ What ? ”
89957	89970	89900	89900	she	511	“ It just seems … wrong . You two are good together . ”
89971	89984	89949	89949	She	511	“ We are , but it ’s how it has to be . ”
89985	89989	89990	89990	Mia	511	“ Says who ? ”
89993	90005	89990	89990	Mia	511	“ Says the complete crushing of my life that was Mason . ”
90006	90014	89900	89900	she	511	“ Is Theo that much like Mason ? ”
90015	90031	90032	90032	I	717	“ They ’re both suit - wearing guys who are very into getting their way , ”
90035	90042	90032	90032	I	717	“ And I ’m still recuperating . ”
90043	90052	90053	90053	Mia	511	“ Not strong enough to withstand his influence ? ”
90056	90059	90060	90060	I	717	“ Exactly , ”
90092	90113	90086	90086	I	717	“ True , he does n’t try to influence me like Mason always would . Mason thought he knew everything . ”
90114	90125	90126	90126	Mia	511	“ And Theo , I ’m sorry , that dress ? ”
90129	90159	90160	90160	She	511	“ On his own , he bought you a gown you love , in your size . It ’s like , an Olympic gold medalist level of boyfriend achievement . ”
90177	90183	90160	90160	She	511	“ I ’m just saying . ”
90184	90204	90207	90207	I	717	“ Theo is a scientist . He observes things with laser - like intensity . That ’s his job . ”
90231	90238	90239	90239	I	717	“ It ’s sort of funny , ”
90242	90295	90239	90239	I	717	“ I was telling him the story about how I fell into the theme cookie niche , and I kept trying to shorten the story , because Mason would get bored with stories like that , but Theo was all , ‘ Wait , back up . I want every detail . ’ ”
90296	90301	90302	90302	Mia	511	“ Dude , please , ”
90305	90312	90302	90302	Mia	511	“ He ’s fascinated with you . ”
90320	90345	90317	90317	I	717	“ And he never tells me what to do . He respects my instincts . In a weird way , I feel … admired . ”
90346	90350	90351	90351	Mia	511	“ So weird ! ”
90498	90501	90502	90502	she	511	“ Uh ! ”
90505	90512	90513	90513	I	717	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? ”
90517	90520	90513	90513	I	717	“ What ? ”
90538	90543	90544	90544	She	511	“ Stupid work stuff . ”
90561	90564	90565	90565	She	511	“ Oooh . ”
90570	90573	90574	90574	She	511	“ What ? ”
90577	90583	90574	90574	She	511	“ For your dream board . ”
90598	90603	90604	90604	I	717	“ Oh , no ! ”
90607	90619	90604	90604	I	717	“ I love this block . This is the perfect block ! ”
90620	90626	90604	90604	I	717	“ Let ’s go look ! ”
90627	90638	90604	90604	I	717	“ I do n’t know if I can bear it . ”
90639	90652	90653	90653	I	717	“ You need it for your dream board . You have to . ”
90699	90703	90704	90704	I	717	“ The ceiling . ”
90715	90720	90711	90711	My	717	“ It ’s so … ”
90721	90724	90725	90725	she	511	“ Amazing , ”
90728	90731	90732	90732	I	717	“ Perfect , ”
90735	90745	90732	90732	I	717	“ If only it was eighteen months from now . ”
90746	90756	90711	90711	My	717	“ Why not call and find out the rent ? ”
90757	90766	90732	90732	I	717	“ It has to be so much money . ”
90767	90772	90773	90773	She	511	“ For comparative purposes . ”
90783	90788	90773	90773	She	511	“ Oh , Lizzie ! ”
90821	90826	90819	90819	fans	1470	“ Kill me now . ”
90882	90888	90879	90879	She	511	“ Can I help you ? ”
90889	90908	90909	90909	Mia	511	“ Sorry , are you … is this your place ? Are you the one leasing it out ? ”
90912	90922	90923	90923	Mia	511	“ Yeah . We just put up the sign . ”
90927	90938	90939	90939	I	717	“ Just out of curiosity , what ’s the rent ? ”
90958	90964	90965	90965	She	511	“ Want to see it ? ”
90971	90983	90984	90984	I	717	“ I ’m more interested in it on an aspirational basis , ”
90996	91002	90993	90993	Mia	511	“ We ’d love to ! ”
91010	91014	91003	91003	She	511	“ Vision board ! ”
91036	91046	91047	91048	the woman	511	“ What sort of operation are you thinking about ? ”
91051	91070	91047	91048	the woman	511	“ I ’d say this space is ideal for retail or small food prep and carry - out . ”
91071	91081	91082	91082	Mia	511	“ She ’s looking for a Cookie Madness space , ”
91097	91107	91088	91089	The woman	511	“ Cookie Madness ? With the fun frosted cookies ? ”
91112	91115	91108	91108	I	717	“ Yeah . ”
91116	91121	91122	91122	Mia	511	“ That was her , ”
91126	91132	91133	91134	the woman	511	“ We loved Cookie Madness , ”
91137	91146	91133	91134	the woman	511	“ We could n’t understand why you closed . ”
91147	91155	91156	91156	Mia	511	“ Her ex was a con man , ”
91159	91166	91167	91167	She	511	“ He took her for everything ! ”
91189	91199	91200	91200	I	717	“ I ’d rather not have that get out , ”
91203	91233	91200	91200	I	717	“ I ’m not in a position to put down a security deposit or anything , really , right now , but I ’ll be back on my feet . ”
91255	91286	91287	91288	The woman	511	“ If this place comes up again the summer after next , or if you have anything else like it , I ’d be in a position to rent it . ”
91293	91313	91314	91314	She	511	“ We ’d love a Cookie Madness in here . It ’s the exact sort of thing we envisioned . ”
91318	91327	91314	91314	She	511	“ Would you be open to something entrepreneurial ? ”
91328	91334	91345	91346	the woman	511	“ What do you mean ? ”
91335	91344	91345	91346	the woman	511	“ A percentage of net instead of rent ? ”
91349	91361	91345	91346	the woman	511	“ We really were fans . We always loved the concept . ”
91389	91399	91400	91401	the woman	511	“ We do n’t want something corporate in here , ”
91404	91423	91400	91401	the woman	511	“ I ’d have to discuss it with my husband , but would you be open to it ? ”
91424	91430	91431	91431	I	717	“ What sort of percentage ? ”
91444	91492	91431	91431	I	717	“ Maybe we could both come up with a number and see where we are , maybe arrive at something we both think is fair . It ’s the kind of business we ’ve always envisioned for this space . Of course we ’d do due diligence . ”
91493	91526	91527	91527	We	1478	“ I would be extremely interested , and I ’d be happy to supply the police report , anything . Though I am getting ready to relocate somewhere cheaper for a while … ”
91857	91861	91862	91862	I	717	“ Ms. Cooper . ”
91880	91886	91869	91869	Marley	120	“ We ’ve missed you . ”
91887	91895	91896	91896	I	717	“ Hey , nice to see you . ”
91904	91911	91896	91896	I	717	“ What ’s with the art ? ”
91912	91921	91869	91869	Marley	120	“ A fancy decorator lady came through here . ”
91922	91928	91929	91929	I	717	“ Does Mr. Drummond know ? ”
92092	92104	92105	92105	She	511	“ You have no idea . You have to see something . ”
92127	92130	92131	92131	I	717	“ Uhh , ”
92137	92140	92141	92141	she	511	“ Ignore , ”
92181	92186	92187	92187	she	511	“ These are deadly , ”
92205	92215	92200	92200	She	511	“ Cheese microwave popcorn . Food of the gods . ”
92218	92239	92200	92200	She	511	“ These caramel things ? Best - kept secret in the baskets . Every department has a basket like this . ”
92240	92246	92187	92187	she	511	“ How is this allowed ? ”
92247	92266	92267	92267	I	717	“ Mr. Drummond promoted Fernice from HR to employee well - being oversight , and suddenly these appeared . ”
92324	92330	92331	92331	she	511	“ IT ran through theirs , ”
92334	92339	92331	92331	she	511	“ And another appeared . ”
92340	92343	92331	92331	she	511	“ Wow . ”
92344	92378	92331	92331	she	511	“ I know we ’re trying to get that deal with Locke Foundation , but it was thoughtful . It ’s not as if they ’d ever know about something internal like this . ”
92379	92382	92383	92383	I	717	“ Yeah , ”
92386	92392	92383	92383	I	717	“ How would they know ? ”
92393	92406	92407	92407	Betsy	217	“ When Mr. Drummond does something , he does n’t go halfway , ”
92425	92452	92410	92410	She	511	“ I ’m working for a caterer , but I just signed a lease deal for an amazing space for a new Cookie Madness on Ninth . ”
92453	92461	92462	92462	I	717	“ Lizzie ! You got a space ? ”
92472	92549	92465	92465	I	717	“ It ’s so perfect — right where Hell ’s Kitchen meets Midtown . A lot of foot traffic . I would n’t have been able to afford it , but the landlord knows my reputation and she wanted me in there . It ’s this older couple — I think they have a lot of money and they just really want what they want . A tiny little place on a corner . So gorgeous . ”
92550	92560	92561	92561	she	1492	“ That ’s where the big food festival is , ”
92564	92574	92561	92561	she	1492	“ You ’re opening a Cookie Madness on Ninth ? ”
92621	92626	92627	92627	I	717	“ That ’s right , ”
92630	92635	92636	92636	she	1492	“ Where on Ninth ? ”
92665	92680	92649	92649	she	1492	“ Ninth and 43rd . It ’s going to be awesome . So amazing . ”
92681	92684	92685	92685	she	1492	“ Huh , ”
92698	92701	92702	92702	She	1492	“ What ? ”
92706	92709	92702	92702	She	1492	“ Nothing . ”
92789	92803	92804	92804	He	605	“ Art ? Microwave popcorn ? What have you done with Mr. Drummond ? ”
92873	92879	92860	92860	He	605	“ How can it be ? ”
92883	92902	92880	92880	I	717	“ I ’m afraid you ’re going to have to fire yourself for promoting a climate of fun . ”
92903	92909	92910	92910	he	605	“ I ’m a scientist , ”
92916	92933	92910	92910	he	605	“ I test things out . Even wild theories from wake - up - call girls . ”
92934	92937	92938	92938	I	717	“ Seriously . ”
92943	92969	92938	92938	I	717	“ You promoted Fernice to oversee employee morale ? That ’s brilliant . I was just down there . I think it ’s already working . ”
92970	92978	92979	92979	he	605	“ It was n’t really my idea , ”
92982	93035	93036	93036	He	605	“ I hired an executive coach , and we brainstormed finding somebody with people skills to complement my chemistry skills . Valerie , that ’s my coach , is all about the carrot over the stick . Or the gift basket , as it were . The microwave popcorn was my addition . ”
93040	93055	93036	93036	He	605	“ If productivity goes up , they ’ll get more colors and more treats . ”
93056	93063	93064	93064	He	605	“ And if it goes down ? ”
93122	93129	93130	93130	I	717	“ I have news , too , ”
93133	93138	93139	93139	he	605	“ Uh - oh , ”
93142	93147	93148	93148	I	717	“ You sound serious . ”
93151	93159	93148	93148	I	717	“ I might ’ve found a space . ”
93167	93173	93174	93174	He	605	“ And it ’s amazing . ”
93179	93183	93174	93174	He	605	“ A space ? ”
93184	93189	93190	93190	I	717	“ For the bakery . ”
93201	93219	93220	93220	He	605	“ I know . It was n’t going to happen . But look . Check it out . ”
93224	93231	93220	93220	He	605	“ Wow . Even your ceiling . ”
93232	93239	93240	93240	I	717	“ Is it amazing or what ? ”
93264	93301	93220	93220	He	605	“ I did n’t think I could get one on my own with no cash and my credit totally shattered . But I did . I got it on my reputation . I did it myself . ”
93319	93324	93314	93314	he	605	“ You ’re staying . ”
93325	93367	93314	93314	he	605	“ I have to figure out how to break it to the subletter . My parents will be sad , but if I really hustle … I mean , with a space like this , I know how to make money . ”
93368	93373	93314	93314	he	605	“ You ’re staying . ”
93374	93377	93378	93378	I	717	“ Yes ! ”
93384	93389	93390	93390	He	605	“ I ’m staying ! ”
93493	93497	93498	93498	He	605	“ Thank goodness . ”
93505	93518	93498	93498	He	605	“ I wanted you to stay , Lizzie . More than anything . ”
93529	93534	93519	93519	I	717	“ More than anything ? ”
93547	93552	93553	93553	My	717	“ More than anything . ”
93584	93592	93593	93593	He	605	“ Let ’s not play games anymore . ”
93603	93608	93593	93593	He	605	“ No more games ? ”
93609	93632	93633	93633	He	605	“ I do n’t mean no more games ever , but it ’s not a game right now . Not for me . ”
93659	93666	93654	93654	I	717	“ You want to try it ? ”
93679	93699	93654	93654	I	717	“ Okay , but I do n’t know where we ’re going . It feels like free - falling . ”
93700	93722	93730	93730	I	717	“ I do n’t know , either , but I know we ’re together , so it ’s okay , right ? ”
93723	93729	93730	93730	I	717	“ I do n’t know . ”
93739	93775	93776	93776	He	605	“ I feel like we ’re on one of those maps they used to draw before they figured out that the world is round . Those maps where they thought you fell off the edge . ”
93784	93798	93799	93799	I	717	“ And they would write ‘ here be dragons ’ around the edges , ”
93802	93820	93821	93821	He	605	“ Because they did n’t know what was out there , only that it was something scary . ”
93832	93846	93821	93821	He	605	“ We ’ll go there together . We ’ll fight the dragons together . ”
93855	93860	93849	93849	I	717	“ Okay , then . ”
93861	93875	93876	93876	he	605	“ And you know what a badass I am in this lab coat , ”
93882	93896	93876	93876	he	605	“ Oh , you get to joke around , but I do n’t ? ”
93897	93907	93909	93909	I	717	“ We can do anything we want , Seven . ”
93972	93985	93986	93986	He	605	“ Then let ’s do this thing . See where it leads . ”
93992	93995	93986	93986	He	605	“ Yes . ”
94122	94126	94111	94111	He	605	“ The door . ”
94155	94161	94162	94162	he	605	“ You are so beautiful , ”
94211	94218	94219	94219	His	605	“ I need you so bad . ”
94230	94236	94224	94224	He	605	“ Need you , too , ”
94308	94311	94312	94312	I	717	“ Theo , ”
94335	94340	94341	94341	He	605	“ I ’m here . ”
94397	94405	94406	94406	he	605	“ Look at us . Fitting perfectly , ”
94409	94412	94406	94406	he	605	“ Perfectly , ”
94538	94548	94531	94531	I	717	“ I have to go deal with this subletter . ”
94549	94561	94531	94531	I	717	“ Wait . Saturday ? Will you come to the banquet ? ”
94569	94574	94575	94575	He	605	“ I ’m in . ”
94578	94581	94575	94575	He	605	“ Good . ”
94587	94610	94582	94582	I	717	“ I ’m going to warn you , do n’t be mad at me if I get scared or weird , okay ? ”
94611	94615	94616	94616	he	605	“ Roger that , ”
94619	94639	94640	94640	He	605	“ I ’m serious . Mason tried to control my life , and he took everything away from me . ”
94676	94684	94673	94673	I	717	“ So if I ’m ever weird … ”
94685	94688	94689	94689	He	605	“ Noted . ”
94695	94710	94689	94689	He	605	“ It feels like a leap , okay ? This whole thing . Scary . ”
94711	94716	94717	94717	he	605	“ We got this , ”
94727	94731	94689	94689	He	605	“ Dinner tonight ? ”
94732	94739	94740	94740	I	717	“ Now who ’s being presumptuous ? ”
94747	94754	94740	94740	I	717	“ Where are you in your — ”
94761	94779	94755	94755	I	717	“ I ’ll hit a stopping point around six . Meet you at seven ? You pick . ”
94780	94800	94740	94740	I	717	“ Wait , this was n’t a stopping point ? Were you running equations this whole time we were … ”
94815	94825	94826	94826	I	717	“ The whole time we were off the map ? ”
94870	94876	94877	94877	I	717	“ I ’m into it , ”
94880	94915	94877	94877	I	717	“ Me , too . I ’m into your animal videos and your pointless , awesome cookies and your snarky comments at four in the morning . I want a hundred and ten percent . ”
94916	94938	94939	94939	I	717	“ You ’re not much of a scientist if you think you ’re going to get a hundred and ten percent , ”
94942	94951	94952	94952	he	717	“ You make me believe in impossible things , ”
95212	95230	95207	95207	she	711	“ Such a fierce businesswoman . With your amazing new space you got with your fabulous reputation . ”
95231	95255	95207	95207	she	711	“ If you ’re trying to do a whole zinger thing on me , you should n’t use facts I feel awesome about . ”
95256	95259	95260	95260	She	711	“ No ? ”
95269	95297	95260	95260	She	711	“ But that ’s what ’s so funny . That you think you got it on your reputation . Did you check who actually leased that space ? ”
95298	95309	95207	95207	she	711	“ What are you talking about ? I leased it . ”
95310	95332	95333	95333	My	717	“ You subleased it . From Theo . Setting you up so you can play bakery . Is n’t that nice ! ”
95361	95377	95378	95378	She	711	“ You can check with Petey Sanger in accounting if you do n’t believe me . ”
95387	95395	95396	95396	I	717	“ That better ? For my zinger ? ”
95401	95425	95426	95426	She	711	“ When impersonating me does n’t work , there ’s always petty jealousy , is n’t there ? It does n’t become you . ”
95433	95454	95426	95426	She	711	“ No ? Okay . But letting you know what an idiot you are ? That for sure becomes me . ”
95524	95529	95532	95532	her	711	“ Uh - oh ! ”
95746	95750	95751	95751	I	717	“ What happened ? ”
95786	95791	95783	95783	She	711	“ How could you ? ”
95803	95810	95783	95783	She	711	“ I ca n’t believe you ! ”
95811	95828	95756	95756	She	711	“ You were leaving , Lizzie . You needed help and you would n’t take it — ”
95829	95873	95783	95783	She	711	“ That ’s because I wanted to do it on my own ! Me . Without a man lording over me . A man with the power to take it all away . You knew that . I asked you to respect that . ”
95874	95880	95756	95756	She	711	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
95881	95894	95895	95895	My	717	“ Having control of my own destiny was so important to me . ”
95902	95915	95895	95895	My	717	“ But you would have control . It would be all yours . ”
95916	95945	95783	95783	She	711	“ No , it would be fake control that you grant me . You did n’t even ask me . You just did it ! Oh my god . ”
95946	95955	95783	95783	She	711	“ I did n’t want to lose you — ”
95956	95976	95895	95895	My	717	“ And that woman ? She and her husband acting like they love Cookie Madness … were they actors ? ”
95977	95982	95783	95783	She	711	“ They were brokers . ”
95983	95996	95783	95783	She	711	“ Brokers who were acting out a script that you gave them . ”
95997	96004	96005	96005	I	717	“ But the contract was real , ”
96008	96063	96005	96005	I	717	“ The terms protect you . The success would be all you . I do n’t want money . I do n’t care about controlling you . I want us . I want to undo some of the wrong that was done to you , so that you can have the success you deserve . ”
96064	96100	96005	96005	I	717	“ Do you not see the problem here ? Do you not see how monumental the deceit is ? I asked you to respect a thing that ’s important to me and you tricked me . ”
96101	96126	96005	96005	I	717	“ I did n’t want to lose us . I did n’t want to look back and think , if only I had n’t … ”
96166	96177	96178	96178	I	717	“ What is the one thing I asked of you ? ”
96191	96199	96178	96178	I	717	“ What is the one simple thing ? ”
96200	96213	96178	96178	I	717	“ To respect your wishes . To not try to control you . ”
96214	96221	96178	96178	I	717	“ And what did you do ? ”
96222	96228	96178	96178	I	717	“ I fell for you . ”
96229	96236	96178	96178	I	717	“ You tried to control me . ”
96237	96241	96242	96242	I	717	“ I know , ”
96245	96250	96242	96242	I	717	“ I messed up . ”
96251	96269	96178	96178	I	717	“ No , missing a date because you ’re absorbed in your work would be messing up . ”
96270	96273	96274	96274	I	717	“ Please , ”
96278	96284	96274	96274	I	717	“ Give us another chance . ”
96285	96290	96291	96291	she	1527	“ I ca n’t , ”
96294	96301	96291	96291	she	1527	“ You ca n’t just leave . ”
96302	96310	96311	96311	She	1527	“ It was always going to happen . ”
96315	96320	96311	96311	She	1527	“ Thank you for … ”
96321	96324	96325	96325	I	717	“ No . ”
96337	96354	96331	96331	she	1527	“ Do n’t follow me , either . I ’m asking you for that one thing . ”
96355	96366	96367	96367	She	1527	“ I do n’t want to live without an us . ”
96387	96392	96393	96393	I	717	“ I ’m sorry , ”
97083	97089	97090	97090	I	717	“ You blew that chance , ”
97093	97106	97090	97090	I	717	“ She showed you honesty and decency , and you blew it . ”
97113	97119	97120	97120	she	711	“ I was n’t thinking , ”
97123	97126	97127	97127	I	717	“ No , ”
97130	97138	97127	97127	I	717	“ And now it ’s too late . ”
97187	97193	97177	97177	I	717	“ What did you do ? ”
97281	97294	97275	97276	my broker	1548	“ Wow . It ’s impressive . Not in a good way . ”
97295	97299	97300	97300	I	717	“ I know , ”
97303	97323	97300	97300	I	717	“ She was going to move temporarily . It did n’t have to mean the end of a relationship . ”
97324	97333	97334	97334	I	717	“ You think I do n’t know that ? ”
97337	97342	97334	97334	I	717	“ She was different . ”
97343	97346	97347	97347	I	717	“ Yeah , ”
97350	97359	97360	97360	I	717	“ She ’ll be back in eighteen months . ”
97369	97386	97390	97390	Lizzie	605	“ On the upside , I ’ve taught myself to make omelets . You want one ? ”
97650	97655	97656	97656	Mia	511	“ No , no ! ”
97664	97667	97656	97656	Mia	511	“ What ? ”
97668	97678	97722	97722	she	511	“ Friends do n’t let friends drunk - dial . ”
97679	97696	97656	97656	Mia	511	“ I ’m not drunk - dialing ; I ’m doing a wake - up call . ”
97697	97704	97656	97656	Mia	511	“ You ca n’t call him . ”
97705	97713	97722	97722	she	511	“ I ’m rethinking this leaving thing . ”
97714	97721	97722	97722	she	511	“ Not while you ’re trashed , ”
97725	97735	97722	97722	she	511	“ What if I was too hard on him ? ”
97736	97748	97749	97749	I	717	“ That ’s a question you have to ask yourself sober . ”
97756	97763	97749	97749	I	717	“ I like him so much . ”
97764	97768	97722	97722	she	511	“ I know . ”
97769	97801	97749	97749	I	717	“ It ’s such a cute space , too . But how can I trust his heart ? I need to trust his heart . That ’s the most important thing . ”
97802	97817	97818	97818	She	511	“ The decision will still be there in the morning , wo n’t it ? ”
97852	97876	97846	97846	I	717	“ I wish he was on Facebook . I just want to know how he ’s doing . Or would that be torture ? ”
97877	97880	97881	97881	she	511	“ Torture , ”
97884	97897	97881	97881	she	511	“ Do I need to take your phone away for the night ? ”
97898	97901	97902	97902	I	717	“ Maybe . ”
97908	97936	97902	97902	I	717	“ I want you to stay , Lizzie , but only if it ’s the right thing for you to do . Not as a tequila decision . ”
97937	97944	97881	97881	she	511	“ Are tequila decisions so bad ? ”
97945	97969	97970	97970	I	717	“ Are you honestly asking me that ? You remember that guy you almost screwed last summer ? The juggler in Clinton Park ? ”
97973	97991	97970	97970	I	717	“ Do you remember the night of hate and gyros ? When we got into that fight ? ”
97992	97995	97996	97996	I	717	“ Yes , ”
98005	98010	98011	98011	she	511	“ No tequila decisions , ”

98095	98100	98086	98086	Mia	511	“ You ’re welcome . ”
98107	98135	98136	98136	She	511	“ It would ’ve been cruel to call him and patch things up . Because today I ’d have to break up with him all over again . ”
98140	98162	98136	98136	She	511	“ I have issues with guys controlling me and he wants to manage everything around him . It can never work . ”
98214	98223	98224	98224	I	717	“ I need to rip the bandage off , ”
98227	98231	98224	98224	I	717	“ Meaning what ? ”
98232	98259	98224	98224	I	717	“ Leave today . I ’m pretty much all packed . You have work and rehearsals all this week — you wo n’t even be here . ”
98260	98270	98224	98224	I	717	“ To stop you from giving him another chance ? ”
98271	98274	98275	98275	I	717	“ Exactly , ”
98278	98291	98275	98275	I	717	“ And last I checked , I could get that van early . ”
98292	98301	98303	98303	I	717	“ I ’ll be here a little bit … ”
98329	98332	98327	98327	him	1565	“ Honey . ”
98333	98343	98344	98344	She	511	“ And you can help me load this way . ”
98347	98358	98344	98344	She	511	“ Oh , I see . I get it now . ”
99147	99154	99139	99139	She	511	“ Lizzie ? Is everything okay ? ”
99155	99158	99159	99159	I	717	“ Yeah , ”
99162	99186	99159	99159	I	717	“ I mean , I ’m just stuck in traffic . But I ’m wondering , should I have listened to the tequila ? ”
99187	99190	99139	99139	She	511	“ What ? ”
99191	99199	99159	99159	I	717	“ Was I hasty ? With leaving ? ”
99200	99203	99159	99159	I	717	“ Well … ”
99204	99211	99212	99212	She	511	“ I ’m thinking I was . ”
99218	99223	99212	99212	She	511	“ Are you sure ? ”
99238	99244	99245	99245	she	511	“ He ’s not Mason , ”
99248	99256	99245	99245	she	511	“ Why did n’t you say anything ? ”
99257	99274	99275	99275	She	511	“ I did ! I said exactly that ! Before we found your storefront . Remember ? ”
99280	99288	99275	99275	She	511	“ Well , I ’m coming back . ”
99289	99294	99245	99245	she	511	“ Oh my god . ”
99295	99304	99308	99309	Lizzie People	238	“ But I need you to do something . ”
99519	99523	99506	99506	She	511	“ You good ? ”
99524	99528	99529	99529	she	511	“ So good , ”
99576	99579	99580	99582	one of them	285	“ Ticket , ”
99585	99595	99596	99596	I	717	“ I ’m a friend of Theo Drummond ’s . ”
99618	99633	99609	99616	the winner of this year ’s Locke Award	1615	“ I need to get in and see him . It ’s very important . ”
99634	99645	99646	99646	I	717	“ You ’ll have to talk to him another time . ”
99782	99790	99791	99791	I	717	“ You have to let me in , ”
99794	99805	99791	99791	I	717	“ He needs me there . It would mean everything . ”
99806	99816	99761	99761	she	530	“ Then he should ’ve given you a ticket . ”
99817	99832	99833	99833	I	717	“ He asked me , but I thought I could n’t at the time , ”
99836	99862	99833	99833	I	717	“ I was moving away , but I changed my mind over Willis Bridge . I turned my entire U - Haul of stuff around — ”
99863	99875	99876	99878	The one doorman	1159	“ That was you out there with the U - Haul ? ”
99894	99897	99898	99898	I	717	“ Please , ”
99901	99914	99915	99916	the one	1159	“ We ’re going to have to ask you to move on , ”
99925	99928	99915	99916	the one	1159	“ Now . ”
99955	99958	99959	99959	I	717	“ Hey ! ”
99972	99978	99979	99979	she	530	“ What ’s going on ? ”
99989	99993	99994	99994	I	717	“ Your brother , ”
99998	100018	100019	100019	Willow	530	“ I have to see him . I need to apologize and tell him … just so many things ! ”
100025	100039	100019	100019	Willow	530	“ She gets to come in . She ’s Theo ’s important friend . ”
100040	100046	100047	100048	the guard	1624	“ Not without an invitation , ”
100073	100084	100085	100085	Willow	530	“ Come on , I ’m Theo Drummond ’s sister . ”
100091	100097	100085	100085	Willow	530	“ I ’m his sister . ”
100098	100109	100110	100112	the other guard	1624	“ I do n’t care if you ’re the Pope , ”
100170	100180	100164	100164	She	1625	“ Willow ? What ’s going on out here ? ”
100181	100184	100185	100185	Willow	530	“ Vicky , ”
100188	100205	100185	100185	Willow	530	“ This is Lizzie . We need to get her in . She ’s with Theo . ”
100206	100215	100216	100218	the first guard	1624	“ You ca n’t have pets in there , ”
100221	100228	100229	100229	Vicky	239	“ He ’s not a pet , ”
100232	100246	100247	100247	She	1625	“ He ’s Smuckers . A very important member of the Locke family . ”
100252	100265	100247	100247	She	1625	“ God , I love your dress . You ’re with Theo ? ”
100289	100313	100282	100282	I	717	“ It ’s a long story , but I need to be in the audience . He needs to know I ’m there . ”
100314	100317	100318	100318	Willow	530	“ Cosign , ”
100328	100336	100318	100318	Willow	530	“ It would mean everything to him . ”
100337	100347	100348	100348	Vicky	239	“ Come on , we ’ll get you in . ”
100381	100385	100386	100386	I	717	“ Thank you , ”
100391	100399	100400	100400	Vicky	239	“ Thank Smuckers for having to pee . ”
100413	100419	100420	100420	she	530	“ Shhh ! Go on , ”
100477	100501	100472	100472	Willow	530	“ At the next break , I ’m gon na lead you to our table up front . You can take his seat . ”
100502	100507	100514	100514	She	530	“ Are you sure ? ”
100508	100513	100514	100514	She	530	“ More than sure ! ”
100520	100529	100514	100514	She	530	“ He ’s up soon , I think . ”
100530	100536	100537	100537	I	717	“ How ’s he been ? ”
100540	100576	100537	100537	I	717	“ Miserable . He ’s just been holed up in his lab . I do n’t think he wrote any kind of speech . Certainly not the dog - and - pony show Locke likes . ”
100577	100583	100514	100514	She	530	“ I feel so bad . ”
100584	100607	100608	100608	Willow	530	“ Do n’t . Trust me , I know how he can be . He ’ll be so happy to see you . ”
100613	100620	100608	100608	Willow	530	“ I know he messed up . ”
100621	100635	100636	100636	People	1718	“ So did I. But I feel sure we can work it out . ”
100640	100643	100644	100644	Willow	530	“ Now , ”
100697	100707	100708	100708	She	530	“ Can they even see us from up there ? ”
100837	100840	100841	100841	Willow	530	“ Wow , ”
100844	100858	100841	100841	Willow	530	“ I did n’t know he was going to talk about all that . ”
100859	100866	100867	100867	Theo	530	“ Inspiration comes in many forms , ”
100871	100894	100895	100895	He	1636	“ I ’ve been trying to nail this formula with all my might . Power it out . And then one day … ”
100926	100936	100937	100937	Willow	530	“ Oh my god , he ’s gone insane , ”
101072	101081	101082	101082	he	1636	“ I was going at it all wrong , ”
101172	101182	101183	101183	he	1636	“ Wake - up calls come in many forms , ”
101192	101246	101247	101247	He	1636	“ Sometimes baby goats show you you ’re being too linear . And sometimes it ’s a literal wake - up call that wakes you up to a world that ’s wider than you ever imagined . Let ’s never stop discovering ways to make it better and more beautiful . Thank you . ”
101255	101258	101259	101259	Willow	530	“ Shit , ”
101262	101267	101259	101259	Willow	530	“ He killed it . ”
101327	101331	101332	101332	He	1636	“ You came . ”
101347	101350	101332	101332	He	1636	“ Theo — ”
101373	101378	101379	101379	I	717	“ I was wrong , ”
101385	101391	101379	101379	I	717	“ Wrong to just leave . ”
101392	101405	101362	101362	He	1636	“ No , I was wrong . I know I was wrong . ”
101406	101446	101447	101447	His	1636	“ But I was wrong to not believe in our power to get past it . We can figure this out . I feel like we can figure anything out . I love that we can figure anything out . ”
101451	101472	101447	101447	His	1636	“ You ca n’t even imagine what it was like to see you out there . I wanted to yell . ”
101473	101480	101481	101481	I	717	“ Probably good you did n’t . ”
101494	101507	101488	101488	They	1649	“ I ’m home . I do n’t want to leave this . ”
101513	101522	101510	101510	I	717	“ You ’re staying ? In the city ? ”
101523	101526	101527	101527	He	1636	“ Yes . ”
101659	101669	101670	101670	she	530	“ He made an omelet for me this morning , ”
101673	101677	101670	101670	she	530	“ He did ? ”
101678	101683	101670	101670	she	530	“ It was terrible . ”
101866	101872	101873	101873	Theo	530	“ That ’s mostly Lizzie , ”
101876	101888	101889	101889	Vicky	239	“ So that ’s where you two fell for each other ? ”
101892	101899	101900	101900	Theo	530	“ When you worked at Vossameer ? ”
101906	101913	101914	101914	I	717	“ It ’s a long story , ”
101927	101939	101922	101922	Vicky	239	“ Okay , you do n’t have to tell . Now … ”
102002	102012	101994	101994	Theo	530	“ I just want to rip this off you . ”
102013	102026	102027	102027	He	1664	“ Do n’t you dare ! It ’s my favorite dress ever ! ”
102111	102119	102120	102120	I	717	“ We ’re talking about our relationship , ”
102123	102135	102120	102120	I	717	“ It seems so weird . But in a good way . ”
102136	102142	102143	102143	He	1664	“ A very good way . ”
102154	102167	102143	102143	He	1664	“ And you know what I ’m going to do tomorrow morning ? ”
102168	102171	102172	102172	I	717	“ What ? ”
102175	102184	102172	102172	I	717	“ I ’m going to make us omelets ! ”
102185	102188	102189	102189	I	717	“ Hmm ! ”
102407	102418	102419	102419	She	511	“ Do n’t you dare laugh . Do n’t even . ”

102451	102459	102448	102448	Mia	511	“ Beware , it ’s almost summer . ”
102530	102535	102536	102536	He	2313	“ What is this ? ”
102585	102590	102577	102577	He	2313	“ Care to explain ? ”
102591	102596	102597	102597	I	717	“ Um , no ? ”
102608	102613	102614	102614	Mia	511	“ Got ta go , ”
102636	102656	102657	102657	he	2313	“ You are a totally impudent wake - up - call girl who needs to be taught a lesson , ”
102660	102664	102657	102657	he	2313	“ Am I ? ”
102671	102677	102665	102665	I	717	“ Am I , really ? ”
102760	102769	102753	102753	Willow	530	“ They ’re fine ! You ’re perfect ! ”
