391	449	450	450	I	1493	“ The office said as much when I tried to switch . It was a specific request for me to be the one to handle that building . It ’s that or I lose the job . And not just one time — no , no , no . Ongoing deliveries . You know it ’s him . ”

I swear to you , the day I first tried on the outfit , the biggest thing on my mind was not how stupid I looked , or how grateful I got hired and all of that . My first thought was , what are the chances I ’ll ever have to deliver to Max Hilton ? A million - something people in Manhattan , what are the chances Max orders from Meow Squad , and I end up with the delivery ? Maximillion Plaza was n’t even in the Meow Squad delivery area when I first started . I thought I ’d be safe . I should ’ve known . ”
1058	1065	1055	1055	Lizzie	61	“ Maybe he wants to apologize ? ”
1066	1088	1055	1055	Lizzie	61	“ No way . Trust me — no apologies will be forthcoming . He ’s rubbing his hands in sweet anticipation . ”

1217	1236	1212	1212	I	1493	“ Of course he did n’t react . Nothing fazes Max . He has a protective titanium exoskeleton . ”
1290	1297	1298	1298	Kelsey	1866	“ You ’ll get through it . ”
1303	1343	1298	1298	Kelsey	1866	“ You do n’t know . Max is my kryptonite . Beyond kryptonite . Kryptonite does n’t live to destroy you . Kryptonite does n’t stare at you with an amused light in its eyes as you die inside . ”

1729	1770	1771	1771	Kelsey	1866	“ He had to find out some other way . God , I can only imagine his glee . He would ’ve been like , how the mighty have fallen . But a more clever and witty version of it . ”
1778	1789	1790	1790	I	1493	“ He is going to rub it in so hard , ”
1793	1825	1790	1790	I	1493	“ He ’ll be laughing the whole time while I set out his sandwich . And then I ’ll have to say Meow at the end . Like a trained monkey . ”

2104	2146	2147	2147	I	1493	“ Here ’s the only thing I ’m wondering — is he planning on guffawing and being all boo - yah as I set out his sandwich ? Or will he go for superior silence with a smirk ? Never mind , ”

3542	3549	3550	3550	I	1493	“ Maybe it ’s a coincidence , ”
3553	3592	3550	3550	I	1493	“ You were there ! It was last fall at the Chiron Club . Remember how he wore the hat ? And he told the funny , sweet story about the strange dog that got in his house ? ”

3729	3756	3725	3725	She	1866	“ Remember how he was all friendly and funny to all of you and ignoring me ? It ’s a little technique called reverse - chasing . ”

3825	3884	3821	3821	She	1866	“ Remember ? Nathan was totally doing that ! His story was funny and sweet , and then I asked him a question , just joining in on the fun , and I touched his arm because it seemed like he was n’t hearing me and he ’s like , ‘ hey , stop pawing the goods . ’ ”
3885	3891	3892	3892	Lizzie	61	“ Stop pawing the goods ? ”
3895	3903	3904	3904	I	1493	“ And we thought it was funny , ”
3909	3931	3904	3904	I	1493	“ Men flock to you like rabid magpies , and this guy was all , ‘ stop hitting on me . ’ ”
3932	3948	3949	3949	I	1493	“ It ’s a technique right from Max ’s book . That worked on me . ”
3984	3989	3990	3990	she	1866	“ Reverse - chasing , ”
3993	4017	3990	3990	she	1866	“ ‘ Act like you think she ’s hitting on you . Rebuff her imaginary advances , but be playful about it . ’ ”
4018	4073	4078	4078	she	1866	“ And you ask him to dance , and he goes , ‘ You think I ’m easy ? Just a piece of meat for you to parade around the dance floor ? ’ And then you ’re staring at him in shock and he goes , ‘ are you mentally undressing me ? ’ ”
4081	4085	4078	4078	she	1866	“ A script . ”
4095	4116	4117	4117	Kelsey	1866	“ He used a lot of these techniques to pick up the other women he was sleeping with , too , ”
4120	4128	4117	4117	Kelsey	1866	“ This book was Nathan ’s bible . ”
4134	4138	4139	4139	Lizzie	61	“ No way , ”
4150	4164	4139	4139	Lizzie	61	“ This jungle kiss — I think somebody did it on Jada Herberger . ”

4270	4359	4265	4265	Lizzie	61	“ ‘ Now memorize this line — There ’s something about it . The way it mixes with your body chemistry that’s … hard to describe . Now pull away . Take your time . You ’re not the pursuer here — she is . Say , scent is such an afterthought in our society — people do n’t understand how deeply and intimately it links to the most primal part of our brain . That ’s why you ’ll see animals scenting each other before mating … ’ ”
4380	4391	4392	4392	she	314	“ No , I ’m reading it in a book ! ”
4395	4403	4404	4404	She	314	“ The Hilton Playbook . Get this — ”
4486	4492	4477	4477	Lizzie	61	“ Jada ’s coming up . ”
4493	4500	4501	4501	Kelsey	1866	“ Tell her to bring beers , ”
4504	4508	4509	4509	Lizzie	61	“ Bring beers ! ”
4575	4587	4588	4588	she	314	“ You ’re telling me the guy was following a script ? ”
4591	4597	4588	4588	she	314	“ Is that the book ? ”
4598	4606	4607	4607	Lizzie	61	“ You want to hear the rest ? ”
4610	4613	4614	4614	Jada	1475	“ No ! ”
4629	4632	4633	4633	Kelsey	1866	“ Yes . ”
4678	4681	4682	4682	Jada	1475	“ Noooo . ”
4690	4698	4682	4682	Jada	1475	“ That was all the Hilton Playbook ? ”
4699	4702	4703	4703	Lizzie	61	“ More ? ”
4706	4713	4714	4714	Jada	1475	“ We ’ve gone this far , ”
4721	4858	4717	4717	Lizzie	61	“ ‘ She ’ll be ready to kiss you , but do n’t give her what she wants . Say , that ’s why it ’s such an intense sensation to be bitten on the neck . The lightest pressure with the teeth , right on the side of the neck , stimulates the basest of instincts . Not a lot of people understand this . Now touch the side of your own neck , showing her where you want her to bite you . Look into her eyes and say , It ’s okay , you can . Act as if she ’s been dying to do it . If you ’ve been doing my system right , she ’ll reach around and take the back of your hair and gently bite your neck . ’ ”
4859	4866	4867	4867	I	1493	“ This is so messed up , ”
4870	4878	4867	4867	I	1493	“ Did you bite him , Jada ? ”
4879	4885	4886	4886	Jada	1475	“ I feel so stupid , ”
4891	4898	4886	4886	Jada	1475	“ Nothing to feel mortified about . ”
4906	4914	4899	4899	I	1493	“ How were you supposed to know ? ”
4915	4930	4931	4931	Kelsey	1866	“ Get this — Nathan , my ex ? He was following this book , ”
4935	4955	4931	4931	Kelsey	1866	“ And I lived with him for a year . While he cheated on me with techniques from it ! ”
4956	4961	4962	4962	Jada	1475	“ Oh my god , ”
5002	5057	4994	4994	Lizzie	61	“ ‘ If she does not take the bait , do not smile . She needs a negative consequence . Find something more interesting to look at . Then turn back to her . Now she ’s ready for your command . Look into her eyes . Go on . Bite me here . ’ ”
5092	5102	5104	5104	she	1866	“ mild approval in the form of a lazy smile ”
5109	5156	5157	5157	We	319	“ ‘ Remember , you are the prize she is vying for . Eventually , she ’ll get the bite right . At this point , finally , you should drop your gaze to her lips . She ’s won the privilege of your kiss . ’ ”
5166	5180	5181	5181	She	1866	“ I ca n’t believe it was all an act from a book ! ”
5184	5209	5181	5181	She	1866	“ Written by that jackass who thinks he ’s Gandy with his face plastered everywhere ? I ca n’t believe I fell for it . ”
5210	5218	5219	5219	I	1493	“ I would ’ve gone for it , ”
5222	5245	5219	5219	I	1493	“ Who does n’t want a guy with knowledge of erotic animal things ? A little crazoo in bed , you know … ”
5246	5252	5253	5253	Lizzie	61	“ And base primal instincts , ”
5256	5277	5253	5253	Lizzie	61	“ You want base primal instincts in a guy . Except when he ’s driving . Or fixing a computer . ”
5278	5286	5287	5287	I	1493	“ Did he wear a weird hat ? ”
5290	5310	5311	5311	Jada	1475	“ No , but he had a lot of cool bracelets and a really shiny shirt under his blazer , ”
5314	5355	5311	5311	Jada	1475	“ And he was not primal or in any way crazoo in bed . Because it was all Max Hilton ’s material . Why am I just finding out about this now ? I need to read this whole book ! ”
5356	5361	5362	5362	Kelsey	1866	“ Mia knows him , ”
5365	5373	5362	5362	Kelsey	1866	“ They went to the Shiz together . ”
5374	5382	5383	5383	Jada	1475	“ Max Hilton went to the Shiz ? ”
5386	5397	5383	5383	Jada	1475	“ What was he studying , utter jackhole - ishness ? ”
5398	5401	5402	5402	I	1493	“ Yes , ”
5411	5437	5438	5438	I	1493	“ You could major in theater arts , classical music , or utter jackhole - ishness . Max was an A student in the latter . ”
5447	5459	5460	5460	Jada	1475	“ And his name was Maxfield Miller . Not Max Hilton . ”
5465	5469	5460	5460	Jada	1475	“ The Shiz ? ”
5470	5476	5477	5477	I	1493	“ Yup . Classical piano , ”
5492	5498	5499	5499	She	1475	“ A little bit jazz . ”
5511	5521	5499	5499	She	1475	“ Piano ? Max Hilton can play … piano ? ”
5522	5525	5526	5526	Kelsey	1866	“ Dude , ”
5532	5539	5540	5540	She	1475	“ He got into the Shiz . ”
5570	5614	5554	5555	The Shiz	1475	“ He comes from a classical music dynasty — don’t you know that ? His father is some famous conductor , and his mother is Gloria Perez , the violinist . And he and Mia were high school rivals in a bitter feud . ”
5615	5621	5622	5622	Jada	1475	“ You hated each other ? ”
5625	5634	5622	5622	Jada	1475	“ Ninety - nine percent of the time . ”
5641	5646	5647	5647	Jada	1475	“ Go for it . ”
5784	5795	5796	5796	I	1493	“ Max Hilton got into the Shiz for classical piano ? ”
5799	5815	5796	5796	I	1493	“ Yup . But his true talent ? Really dorky old - timey show tunes . ”
5816	5819	5820	5820	Jada	1475	“ No ! ”
5823	5853	5820	5820	Jada	1475	“ You should hear him sing songs from Oklahoma ! playing the aw - shucks lovesick cowpoke , Curly McLain . Goofy comic songs . I ’m telling you . ”
5868	5881	5862	5862	Kelsey	1866	“ Definitely the last thing I can imagine out of Max Hilton . ”
5992	6002	6003	6003	Jada	1475	“ Is this something we can find on YouTube ? ”
6006	6014	6003	6003	Jada	1475	“ Pretty please , please say yes ? ”
6015	6045	6046	6046	I	1493	“ Do you think , with all of Max Hilton ’s money and power , that he would allow a YouTube of him singing goofy to be out there ? ”
6049	6068	6046	6046	I	1493	“ That he and his people would n’t put the boot down on something like that so hard ? ”
6120	6134	6135	6135	Kelsey	1866	“ How did you never tell any of us this bit of gossip ? ”
6189	6195	6196	6196	Jada	1475	“ But you witnessed it ? ”
6199	6217	6218	6218	Jada	1475	“ I was in the summer production with him . I sang opposite him . So yeah . ”
6237	6243	6244	6244	Jada	1475	“ And you were enemies , ”
6247	6267	6268	6268	I	1493	“ We made careers out of humiliating each other . Max ’s business partner Parker went there , too , ”
6271	6281	6268	6268	I	1493	“ It ’s just old Shiz week over there . ”
6282	6305	6306	6306	Kelsey	1866	“ And guess which Meow Squad delivery cat is going to have to deliver his lunch from now on ? Starting tomorrow ? ”
6312	6315	6309	6309	Jada	1475	“ No ! ”
6318	6326	6309	6309	Jada	1475	“ Not that it ’s that bad . ”
6327	6332	6333	6333	I	1493	“ Do n’t even , ”
6336	6365	6366	6366	Lizzie	61	“ I have to be a servile minion to my high school rival . Wearing a cat suit . And he ’s a billionaire in a gleaming tower . ”
6373	6388	6389	6389	Jada	1475	“ Would you be fired if you let your friend Jada poison his sandwich ? ”
6484	6489	6490	6490	I	1493	“ Oh my god ! ”
6493	6500	6490	6490	I	1493	“ Antonio , I completely forgot . ”
6622	6639	6640	6640	I	1493	“ You guys remember my cousin Antonio , right ? We were supposed to run lines . ”
6646	6652	6640	6640	I	1493	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
6653	6662	6663	6663	Kelsey	1866	“ We ’ll all run lines with you . ”
6675	6702	6663	6663	Kelsey	1866	“ First you have to tell the truth , though — do you recognize this book ? Have you ever used it to pick up women ? ”
6724	6741	6703	6703	Antonio	549	“ A pickup book ? I ’m a male model with an Italian accent , cara … ”
6742	6752	6753	6753	I	1493	“ True , he does n’t need the book , ”
6756	6780	6781	6781	Antonio	549	“ Unless it ’s to drive off women by beating them over the head with it . He could use it for that . ”
6794	6797	6798	6798	He	549	“ Americans . ”
6805	6833	6834	6834	We	337	“ ‘ Never ask a woman what she wants — tell her what she wants . You are a capricious god and she is your subject . ’ ”
6853	6863	6864	6864	Antonio	549	“ Such stuff would work on men , too , ”
6871	6885	6864	6864	Antonio	549	“ You could wrap a man around your little finger with these techniques . ”
6886	6894	6895	6895	I	1493	“ If you ’re an awful person , ”
6905	6929	6930	6930	He	549	“ But if you wanted to bring a man to his knees . Some of them would perhaps need to be adjusted but … ”
6935	6943	6930	6930	He	549	“ This is what I ’m saying . ”
6944	6947	6948	6948	Kelsey	1866	“ Seriously ? ”
6951	6965	6948	6948	Kelsey	1866	“ You honestly think these techniques could bring a guy to his knees ? ”
6966	6970	6971	6971	he	549	“ Of course , ”
7042	7051	7052	7052	I	1493	“ Maybe even bring Max to his knees ? ”
7075	7084	7065	7065	I	1493	“ What are you thinking here , Kelsey ? ”
7085	7092	7093	7093	she	1866	“ I ’m thinking about justice , ”
7096	7099	7100	7100	Jada	1475	“ Yes ! ”
7109	7122	7100	7100	Jada	1475	“ Justice . You could show him how it feels , Mia . ”
7123	7133	7134	7134	I	1493	“ I ’m not doing pickup techniques on Max , ”
7137	7162	7163	7163	Kelsey	1866	“ It ’s not about pickup techniques , it ’s about showing him how it feels to have somebody work a system on him , ”
7166	7177	7163	7163	Kelsey	1866	“ He needs to know . It ’s perfect karma . ”
7178	7184	7185	7185	I	1493	“ Except he wrote it , ”
7188	7197	7185	7185	I	1493	“ It probably would n’t work on him . ”
7198	7215	7216	7216	Lizzie	61	“ Or maybe it would work on him better than it would work on anyone else , ”
7219	7255	7216	7216	Lizzie	61	“ He wrote a manual on how to get to a person ’s heart . How many hearts do you think he knows firsthand ? One . He only knows one heart . His own . ”
7256	7265	7266	7267	My pals	338	“ You ’re assuming he has a heart . ”
7335	7338	7339	7339	I	1493	“ Anyway , ”
7342	7357	7339	7339	I	1493	“ I think he ’d recognize somebody running his own golden rules on him . ”
7358	7376	7377	7377	Kelsey	1866	“ No way . He ’d never know . He wrote that book almost ten years ago , ”
7380	7448	7449	7449	Jada	1475	“ My sister writes books . She ca n’t remember anything she wrote even one year back . She says her head fills up with a new book and crowds out the old one . And this guy , he ’s running a billion - dollar business and being all Mister Celeb ? Trust me , Max Hilton has no memory of what ’s in this book . ”
7454	7471	7449	7449	Jada	1475	“ Do it ! Teach him a lesson . Make him crawl on his grovelly knees . ”
7472	7491	7492	7492	I	1493	“ I do n’t know if it can be done by a person who ’s just delivering sandwiches , ”
7495	7511	7492	7492	I	1493	“ And the whole reason he requested my deliveries is to make fun of me . ”
7512	7524	7525	7525	Jada	1475	“ You ’ll see him every day . It ’s perfect ! ”
7758	7771	7748	7748	I	1493	“ Use his own system to wrap him around my little finger … ”
7779	7789	7772	7772	I	1493	“ and then I bring him to his knees . ”
7790	7795	7796	7796	Jada	1475	“ His grovelly knees , ”
7887	7892	7893	7893	I	1493	“ Okay , then , ”
7896	7914	7915	7915	Kelsey	1866	“ I ’ll do it . I ’m gon na bring Max Hilton to his grovelly knees . ”
8179	8187	8188	8188	Kelsey	1866	“ This one is already a problem . ”
8199	8225	8188	8188	Kelsey	1866	“ ‘ Demonstrate your alpha status by wearing standout clothes and otherwise adorning yourself with symbols of your utter superiority . ’ Seems pretty straightforward . ”
8226	8268	8269	8269	Kelsey	1866	“ I have to wear the cat outfit . You get fired if you cover it up or do n’t wear it . Seriously , they ’d fire me if I showed up in a gown or a tiara or something . ”
8294	8335	8288	8288	Jada	1475	“ It says that you ca n’t hide the ears or put other clothes over the cat suit , but what if you became the most fabulous cat ? There ’s nothing here forbidding you from jazzing up the outfit . ”
8336	8366	8288	8288	Jada	1475	“ You guys , the fact that I ’m a delivery girl who has to wear an embarrassing cat outfit is not a quality I want to play up . ”
8367	8373	8374	8374	Kelsey	1866	“ Unless you work it ! ”
8377	8389	8374	8374	Kelsey	1866	“ You know how to work an outfit better than anyone . ”
8390	8401	8288	8288	Jada	1475	“ I ’m not working the Meow Squad delivery outfit . ”
8402	8415	8416	8416	Jada	1475	“ I have a glue gun downstairs . And sequins and rhinestones — ”
8419	8426	8427	8427	I	1493	“ — that are staying downstairs , ”
8430	8433	8434	8434	Lizzie	61	“ Yessss , ”
8437	8445	8434	8434	Lizzie	61	“ And you ’ll need fake eyelashes . ”
8446	8453	8465	8465	Kelsey	1866	“ Oh my god , no ! ”
8454	8464	8465	8465	Kelsey	1866	“ I have those silver go - go boots , ”
8468	8490	8465	8465	Kelsey	1866	“ Go get your outfit , Mia . We ’re going to make you the most fabulous delivery cat of all . ”
8491	8508	8509	8509	Jada	1475	“ Do n’t you want to bring him to his grovelly knees for all of womankind ? ”
8512	8530	8531	8531	Lizzie	61	“ While turning the tables on him ? And then crush him under your sparkly silver heel ? ”
8535	8543	8544	8544	She	61	“ This is going to be perfect ! ”
8604	8633	8597	8597	She	61	“ If you do all ten of the golden rules to Max over the course of your deliveries , I ’m putting one hundred dollars toward your Louboutins . ”
8656	8664	8665	8665	Jada	1475	“ I ’m in for a hundred , ”
8668	8673	8674	8674	Lizzie	61	“ Two hundred fifty ! ”
8697	8700	8701	8701	I	1493	“ Wow , ”
8704	8708	8709	8709	Kelsey	1866	“ As thanks , ”
8779	8795	8796	8796	I	1493	“ I do n’t know about going around with two beautiful women on my arm , ”
8799	8806	8807	8807	Jada	1475	“ What about two beautiful men ? ”
8818	8824	8825	8825	Antonio	549	“ I do not share , ”
8828	8839	8840	8840	We	362	“ Please . One of me is enough , no ? ”
8865	8877	8878	8878	Antonio	549	“ I ’ll do it . I ’ll be your suitor , ”
8881	8890	8878	8878	Antonio	549	“ But I ’ll need a good backstory . ”
8891	8895	8896	8896	I	1493	“ No backstory , ”
8899	8908	8896	8896	I	1493	“ It would n’t be a speaking part . ”
8909	8918	8919	8919	Antonio	549	“ I follow you in on your delivery , ”
8922	8937	8919	8919	Antonio	549	“ so jealous am I when you so much as look at another man . ”
8938	8948	8949	8949	I	1493	“ You ca n’t follow me on my deliveries , ”
8952	8968	8969	8969	Antonio	549	“ You ’d get me fired . We ’ll have to think of something else . ”
9626	9634	9620	9620	Sienna	92	“ What ’s up with the boots ? ”
9635	9640	9641	9641	I	1493	“ Nothing . Just … ”
9722	9730	9731	9731	I	1493	“ You lose a bet or something ? ”
9754	9769	9770	9770	Sienna	92	“ No , I ’ve decided that I ’m the queen of delivery cats . ”
9776	9784	9770	9770	Sienna	92	“ Are you trying to be funny ? ”
9785	9816	9770	9770	Sienna	92	“ Do I look like I ’m trying to be funny ? Do you see the work that went into this ? I ’m the queen of the delivery cats . ”
9817	9826	9770	9770	Sienna	92	“ What ? You just … decided that ? ”
9827	9832	9833	9833	She	380	“ That ’s right . ”
9849	9854	9855	9855	She	380	“ Oh - kaaaaaay . ”
9927	9942	9943	9943	Sienna	92	“ Is n’t that kind of like declaring yourself the queen of the latrine ? ”
9950	9971	9943	9943	Sienna	92	“ Or like declaring yourself to be the most Burger Bob’s - iest of the Burger Bob ’s fry crew ? ”
9985	9994	9995	9995	I	1493	“ It ’s not like that at all , ”
10002	10017	10018	10018	She	92	“ I am queen of the delivery cats . It ’s a desirable thing . ”
10021	10031	10018	10018	She	92	“ So you think you ’re the manager now ? ”
10032	10084	10094	10094	she	92	“ No . It ’s like , the queen of England does n’t actually run the country . I ’m queen of the delivery cats like that . I ’m queen in spirit , in enthusiasm , in adornment . I ’m alpha cat , and these shiny things signify that . ”
10085	10093	10094	10094	she	92	“ Well , they ’re signifying something , ”
10097	10103	10104	10104	I	1493	“ They signify my superiority , ”
10157	10167	10147	10147	they	391	“ That ’s not the word I was thinking . ”
10215	10231	10200	10200	I	1493	“ I ’m the top cat now . I ’m the queen of the cats . ”
10263	10309	10310	10310	he	266	“ When you alpha - signal , it ’s not just about looking amazing , it ’s also about communicating that you have enough personal power to pull off a bold look . The more you own your look , the more power you communicate , ”
10329	10338	10339	10339	Sienna	92	“ What if I want to be queen ? ”
10342	10346	10347	10347	I	1493	“ Too bad , ”
10350	10358	10359	10359	She	92	“ There can only be one queen . ”
10370	10383	10359	10359	She	92	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re going to deliver in that . ”
10384	10389	10390	10390	I	1493	“ Watch and weep , ”
10712	10720	10699	10699	We	402	“ This is going to be great , ”
10734	10753	10721	10721	I	1493	“ I ’m the ultimate delivery cat . And the ending meow ? I ’ve got something better . ”
10803	10811	10812	10812	she	418	“ What are you going to do ? ”
10841	10844	10845	10845	I	1493	“ Meowwwwww ! ”
10937	10943	10944	10944	I	1493	“ Cat got your tongue ? ”
10962	10968	10955	10955	I	1493	“ It ’s just that … ”
10972	10975	10976	10976	I	1493	“ What ? ”
11008	11019	11003	11003	he	94	“ You ’re gon na kill with tips out there . ”
11023	11027	11028	11028	He	94	“ You think ? ”
11031	11042	11043	11043	I	1493	“ Queen of the cats . You know you are . ”
12472	12477	12506	12506	she	470	“ Meow Squad delivery . ”
12478	12491	12492	12492	She	470	“ Go ahead and bring it down . All the way down . ”
12822	12826	12819	12819	I	1493	“ Lunch delivery . ”
12839	12842	12843	12843	he	266	“ Come , ”
13083	13086	13087	13087	I	1493	“ Mia ? ”
13191	13199	13200	13200	I	1493	“ Mia . What are you doing ? ”
13358	13361	13362	13362	I	1493	“ Max , ”
13365	13376	13362	13362	I	1493	“ Looks like somebody ’s getting a delicious croissant sandwich . ”
13470	13476	13477	13477	I	1493	“ Very nice , Max , ”
13480	13488	13477	13477	I	1493	“ All of this is very impressive . ”
13590	13593	13594	13594	I	1493	“ Wait . ”
13636	13641	13625	13625	he	266	“ What is it ? ”
13734	13752	13722	13722	URL	100	“ It says right on the bag that I get to choose from an array of chips . ”
13753	13766	13767	13767	He	266	“ When no choice is made , you get plain Lay ’s . ”
13770	13780	13781	13781	I	1493	“ I ’d prefer to choose from the array . ”
13802	13821	13793	13793	I	1493	“ I have Lay ’s , cheesy puffs , barbeque , cool ranch , and baked sea salt . ”
13822	13828	13829	13829	He	266	“ Let ’s see them . ”
13845	13856	13829	13829	He	266	“ Well … I just told you what they are . ”
13857	13862	13863	13863	he	266	“ I ’m sorry , ”
13866	13897	13863	13863	he	266	“ But presented with an array is a visual concept . I ’d like to be presented with my array . I think I ’m entitled , do n’t you ? ”
13928	13938	13939	13939	I	1493	“ Oh , I definitely think you ’re entitled , ”
13953	13957	13958	13958	His	266	“ Very entitled . ”
13965	13979	13958	13958	His	266	“ Present my array , Mia ; I do n’t have all day . ”
14186	14203	14204	14204	He	266	“ Lay ’s , cheesy puffs , barbeque , cool ranch , and baked sea salt . ”
14224	14227	14228	14228	He	266	“ Hmm . ”
14333	14337	14338	14338	he	266	“ Very good , ”
14422	14425	14426	14426	I	1493	“ Well ? ”
14429	14432	14433	14433	He	266	“ Hmm . ”
14483	14491	14492	14492	he	266	“ I ’ll take the cheesy puffs , ”
14508	14518	14492	14492	he	266	“ Open them and set them here , please . ”
14600	14604	14605	14605	he	266	“ Thank you , ”
14903	14906	14907	14907	He	516	“ Meowwwww ! ”
14950	14958	14929	14929	he	516	“ That ’ll be all , Mia . ”
15222	15233	15234	15234	Dad	104	“ The higher you shoot , the harder you fall , ”
15358	15378	15379	15379	she	537	“ I want you to know that I dated a guy off that capricious - god - escalation move , ”
15385	15420	15379	15379	she	537	“ And I found half the things he ever told me in the back of that book . I kept giving him chances because of those stories and it was all Max Hilton material ! ”
15421	15426	15427	15427	I	1493	“ Oh , no , ”
15430	15435	15436	15436	Kelsey	1866	“ This is Francine , ”
15447	15452	15453	15453	Francine	105	“ Francine is in . ”
15456	15508	15453	15453	Francine	105	“ I ’m putting a hundred toward buying your heels because you are so amazing for doing this , and here ’s another hundred from my sister , who fell for half the lines in there . Kelsey told us to read that book , and we ’ve been freaking out . ”
15509	15513	15514	15514	I	1493	“ Thank you , ”
15517	15528	15514	15514	I	1493	“ but I do n’t know … this whole thing ... ”
15536	15549	15550	15550	Jada	1475	“ Are you gon na have him on his grovelly knees soon ? ”
15573	15576	15567	15567	She	1866	“ What ? ”
15577	15588	15589	15589	I	1493	“ It was harder than I thought it would be , ”
15592	15633	15589	15589	I	1493	“ It might be a little ambitious , thinking I ’m going to put Max Hilton on his knees . After today , I ’d settle for retaining a shred of dignity . It could not have been more demeaning . ”
15634	15643	15644	15644	Antonio	549	“ Demeaning the woman who inspires my dreams ? ”
15650	15666	15644	15644	Antonio	549	“ Perhaps my character needs to teach this man a lesson he wo n’t forget . ”
15667	15671	15672	15672	I	1493	“ Do n’t , ”
15685	15691	15692	15692	Kelsey	1866	“ It ’s not funny . ”
15701	15706	15707	15707	She	1866	“ You got this . ”
15719	15724	15707	15707	She	1866	“ You got it . ”
15725	15733	15734	15734	I	1493	“ Yeah , I do n’t know , ”
15737	15741	15734	15734	I	1493	“ What happened ? ”
15763	15774	15754	15754	Antonio	549	“ It was just the worst experience of my life . ”
15775	15783	15784	15784	Jada	1475	“ So , you wore the ears ? ”
15788	15793	15784	15784	Jada	1475	“ Did he notice ? ”
15794	15873	15874	15874	I	1493	“ Hard to say . Max is a man with a carefully curated surface . I know in his pictures he looks all natural and warm and friendly with his enchanting smile , but he ’s a cold , calculating metal robot . He gives you nothing . Though he did try to act like he was surprised that I was there , and then he got off on ordering me around . It was just … uhhh . ”
15883	15888	15874	15874	I	1493	“ I would die , ”
15893	15898	15899	15899	I	1493	“ I wanted to , ”
15924	15934	15912	15912	her	105	“ Why is he such an asshole to you ? ”
15935	15955	15969	15969	Kelsey	1866	“ Because we ’re natural enemies in the wild . Why is the lion an asshole to the antelope ? ”
15956	15968	15969	15969	Kelsey	1866	“ I think that ’s a negative way of framing it , ”
15972	15990	15969	15969	Kelsey	1866	“ It positions you as the prey of the lion . You ’re more like the giraffe . ”
15991	16000	16001	16001	I	1493	“ A lion can take down a giraffe , ”
16004	16007	16008	16008	Jada	1475	“ Hyena ? ”
16011	16028	16008	16008	Jada	1475	“ The lion can rarely get the best of a hyena . You ’re the hyena . ”
16029	16050	15969	15969	Kelsey	1866	“ The hyena . Thank you , Jada . Why not a plague of locusts ? Or a noxious cloud ? ”
16051	16057	16062	16062	I	1493	“ I did n’t mean — ”
16058	16061	16062	16062	I	1493	“ Kidding , ”
16068	16122	16062	16062	I	1493	“ Anyway , I ’m a long way to bringing him to his grovelly knees . It ’s not just about his heartless power . There ’s a massive flock of supermodels that will be keeping him from sinking to his grovelly knees for me . With gossamer threads . Lifting him up . ”
16123	16128	16129	16129	Kelsey	1866	“ Max Hilton girls , ”
16161	16171	16155	16157	Max Hilton girls	266	“ You do n’t think those girls all actually … ”
16172	16184	16185	16185	Jada	1475	“ Fuck him ? No way , it ’s just publicity , ”
16188	16211	16212	16212	I	1493	“ Socialites and models and designers use him for his name . And he ’s using them for the Max Hilton illusion . ”
16224	16243	16244	16244	Kelsey	1866	“ Yeah , they ’d flee like rats if he went out in sweatpants with socks under sandals . ”
16247	16260	16261	16261	Antonio	549	“ Give them a break . The Max Hilton girls are sweet , ”
16264	16276	16261	16261	Antonio	549	“ They ’re very attractive and clever too . On Instagram … ”
16277	16280	16281	16281	Kelsey	1866	“ Uhhh . ”
16318	16322	16312	16312	Antonio	549	“ What ? ! ”
16323	16330	16331	16331	Kelsey	1866	“ It ’s PR , Antonio , ”
16334	16342	16343	16343	I	1493	“ That ’s not who they are . ”
16372	16386	16387	16387	Kelsey	1866	“ It was only your first day working his own rules on him , ”
16390	16408	16409	16409	I	1493	“ Do we need to get out the Hilton Playbook and read what it says about perseverance ? ”
16412	16415	16409	16409	I	1493	“ No . ”
16416	16422	16423	16423	Francine	105	“ What does it say ? ”
16426	16432	16433	16433	Kelsey	1866	“ To not get discouraged , ”
16436	16452	16433	16433	Kelsey	1866	“ Hold your head up high and keep moving forward . You can do anything . ”
16453	16467	16468	16468	Francine	105	“ As long as you have Max Hilton telling you what to do , ”
16471	16478	16479	16479	Antonio	549	“ It ’s a good system , ”
16503	16514	16515	16515	Jada	1475	“ You have to deliver sandwiches to him either way , ”
16519	16562	16515	16515	Jada	1475	“ You may as well check off all of the boxes . Worst - case scenario , we buy you those shoes . Best - case scenario , he ’s on his knees and you are wearing them as you crush him . ”
16563	16569	16570	16570	Kelsey	1866	“ You can do it ! ”
16585	16607	16570	16570	Kelsey	1866	“ Put an X in that box ! You nailed that rule . One golden move down , nine to go . ”
16615	16623	16624	16624	Francine	105	“ And you ’re fighting for us , ”
16627	16675	16624	16624	Francine	105	“ For all of us who went home with a clever , exciting guy and woke up with a loser . You ’re our hero . You ’re showing Max what it ’s like for somebody to do a system on him . Please do n’t quit . ”
16676	16679	16680	16680	Jada	1475	“ Pleeeeease , ”
16857	16869	16850	16852	Joan of Arc	108	“ One golden rule down , nine to go , bitches ! ”
16999	17007	17008	17008	Kelsey	1866	“ What rule are you doing tomorrow ? ”
17016	17023	17011	17011	I	1493	“ Reverse - chasing is next . ”
17024	17029	17030	17030	Francine	105	“ Reverse - chasing ? ”
17037	17048	17049	17049	There	109	“ Oh , I know all about reverse - chasing . ”
17058	17136	17049	17049	There	109	“ Reverse - chasing is where you act like the woman you want to pick up is after you , even though she totally is not . And you ’re all like , get away ! Even though she ’s not at all after you , but you act like you think she is , and it intrigues her . Falsely . That ’s how my cheating ex kicked things off . If only I ’d known . ”
17153	17173	17148	17148	she	105	“ So you ’re gon na do it right back at him . What are you gon na say ? ”
17174	17196	17148	17148	she	105	“ I do n’t have it worked out . But I have some ideas . I want it to feel spontaneous . ”
17197	17205	17206	17206	Kelsey	1866	“ Mia can improv like a boss , ”
17209	17227	17206	17206	Kelsey	1866	“ Mia’ll reverse - chase his ass so hard , he wo n’t know what hit him . ”
17228	17236	17237	17237	Antonio	549	“ Do not forget prize - baiting . ”
17243	17262	17263	17263	He	549	“ Where you position yourself as a prize . A sought - after partner , desired by others . ”
17272	17283	17263	17263	He	549	“ I ’ve been working on my backstory , cara . ”
17284	17288	17289	17289	I	1493	“ You have ? ”
17324	17333	17334	17334	He	549	“ And when I dress in Hugo Boss ? ”
17339	17347	17334	17334	He	549	“ With this backstory I ’m creating ? ”
17348	17364	17365	17365	I	1493	“ You in a suit , that ’s probably all we need , right there , ”
17368	17375	17376	17376	he	549	“ But to add this backstory , ”
17379	17434	17376	17376	he	549	“ We ’ll see . I did see Max cross the street from afar , going between his two buildings , before the last delivery . Around eleven . So we could set it up so he sees you talking with me out there , but you would n’t have to interact with him . ”
17435	17443	17444	17444	Kelsey	1866	“ You saw him before the delivery ? ”
17447	17504	17505	17505	Antonio	549	“ Just from afar . I was pretty sure it was him . Max ’s company owns this rehabbed workshop space across the street from Maximillion Plaza . If he goes back and forth often at that time , I could get the driver to park at a spot where Antonio would be visibly admiring me . ”
17510	17524	17505	17505	Antonio	549	“ I will be such a suitor . He will see my passion . ”
17525	17554	17505	17505	Antonio	549	“ My plan is that you just smile at me a lot and laugh at whatever I say . It does n’t have to be over the top . ”
17555	17564	17505	17505	Antonio	549	“ He would see my desperation for you . ”
17565	17571	17572	17572	I	1493	“ Just passion is good , ”
17575	17582	17583	17583	Antonio	549	“ No , it ’s desperation . ”
17597	17648	17590	17590	Scarface	113	“ I grew up poor in the streets . My father rejected me . My mother was cruel but beautiful . So poor were we that they sold me to a brothel when I was but a boy . I was forced to sell myself in the alleyways of Milano . ”
17649	17659	17660	17660	I	1493	“ Double Dark Chocolate Milano is my favorite cookie , ”
17669	17676	17677	17677	Antonio	549	“ Milano is not a cookie , ”
17680	17686	17677	17677	Antonio	549	“ It ’s a city . ”
17687	17692	17693	17693	Jada	1475	“ Sorry , Antonio … ”
17696	17706	17693	17693	Jada	1475	“ In America it kind of is a cookie . ”
17707	17719	17720	17720	Antonio	549	“ If you knew the underbelly of Milano as I did , ”
17723	17730	17720	17720	Antonio	549	“ you would not think it . ”
17731	17737	17738	17738	I	1493	“ The underbelly of Milano , ”
17741	17755	17756	17756	I	1493	“ Is that near the hardscrabble alley behind the Keebler Elves ’ Factory ? ”
17764	17778	17759	17759	Jada	1475	“ I believe it ’s located east of the Pepperidge Farms killing fields . ”
17779	17792	17793	17793	Kelsey	1866	“ Stop it , you guys ! Let Antonio tell his backstory . ”
17798	17808	17809	17809	Antonio	549	“ Ignore them , Antonio . Please go on . ”
17818	17844	17845	17845	I	1493	“ I grew up fighting hoodlums . The fist , the blade . What did I care ? What did ever I see of life ? ”
17851	17862	17863	17863	He	549	“ Too many productions of West Side Story , maybe ? ”
17870	17893	17894	17894	I	1493	“ Dude , I ’m just saying you should save this backstory for a real role where you have lines and things , ”
17901	17926	17894	17894	I	1493	“ So many shameful acts I did until I hit rock bottom , so desperate was I for a kind word from my mother . ”
17927	17931	17932	17932	Jada	1475	“ Your mother ? ”
17935	17944	17945	17945	Kelsey	1866	“ Are you going Jerry Springer on us ? ”
17950	17957	17945	17945	Kelsey	1866	“ Come on , you guys ! ”
17958	17968	17969	17969	Antonio	549	“ Italian men prize the love of their mothers , ”
17972	17981	17982	17982	He	549	“ It is a pure and good thing . ”
17987	18005	17982	17982	He	549	“ Then , at my lowest , lying in the gutter , I see your Yummies ad . ”
18006	18015	18016	18016	I	1493	“ Oh my god , Antonio , no , ”
18037	18048	18019	18019	I	1493	“ I do n’t think they have Yummies in Milano . ”
18049	18064	18065	18065	Jada	1475	“ They do n’t have Yummies there because all the people are eating Milanos , ”
18127	18164	18122	18122	he	549	“ It is your beauty and talent that inspired me to clean myself up and climb from the gutter and come to America . To seek you out . You are the light of my life . ”
18165	18176	18177	18177	I	1493	“ Umm … that ’s an amazing backstory , Antonio , ”
18180	18215	18177	18177	I	1493	“ Not that you ’ll be able to use it . But I guess there ’s no harm in having that on your mind as you appear to admire me when Max walks by . ”
18244	18255	18256	18256	he	549	“ Will we kiss ? We could make a signal , ”
18259	18271	18272	18272	I	1493	“ I remember every one of your expert stage kissing pointers . ”
18390	18399	18402	18402	him	549	“ We wo n’t need a stage kiss , ”
18404	18430	18400	18400	I	1493	“ Your character sounds protective and macho . Maybe he prefers his woman to appear modest . I doubt he ’d wanna go all PDA . ”
18431	18441	18442	18442	he	549	“ Unless he feels his woman is being ogled , ”
18445	18455	18442	18442	he	549	“ Then he would want to claim her publicly . ”
18456	18472	18400	18400	I	1493	“ Yeah , but what if she gets carried away and messes up his hair ? ”
18484	18491	18492	18492	he	549	“ She must not do that , ”
18498	18519	18495	18495	I	1493	“ Well , it luckily wo n’t come to that . It would just be you looking adoringly at me . ”
18632	18637	18638	18638	I	1493	“ Again ? Seriously ? ”
18673	18684	18669	18669	She	92	“ Seriously ? How much did it raise your tips ? ”
18685	18690	18691	18691	I	1493	“ Does it matter ? ”
18694	18705	18691	18691	I	1493	“ Sienna , only one cat can be alpha queen . ”
18706	18713	18714	18714	she	92	“ Cats do n’t have alphas , ”
18717	18724	18725	18725	I	1493	“ They ’re not pack animals . ”
18731	18736	18737	18737	she	92	“ Four percent better ? ”
18750	18755	18740	18740	I	1493	“ Forty ? ! ? ”
18756	18759	18737	18737	she	92	“ Forty . ”
18779	18786	18787	18787	I	1493	“ Are you messing with me ? ”
18792	18798	18799	18799	She	92	“ Not messing with you . ”
18804	18816	18799	18799	She	92	“ It could ’ve been the shock of the new outfit . ”
18817	18820	18821	18821	She	92	“ Possibly . ”
18826	18850	18821	18821	She	92	“ Lemme know if the tips stay good . If this thing holds , I ’m doing alpha - queen cat , too . ”
18851	18858	18859	18859	I	1493	“ I ’ll let you know , ”
19014	19018	19019	19019	I	1493	“ Meow Squad , ”
19022	19025	19019	19019	I	1493	“ Come . ”
19232	19238	19218	19218	He	266	“ Lay it out here . ”
19277	19280	19281	19281	he	266	“ Mia , ”
19284	19294	19281	19281	he	266	“ Did I not say to lay it out ? ”
19295	19298	19281	19281	he	266	“ What ? ”
19299	19306	19307	19307	He	266	“ Lay . It . Out . ”
19446	19456	19439	19439	I	1493	“ You ’re asking me to lay it out ? ”
19457	19460	19461	19461	he	581	“ Yes , ”

20663	20677	20678	20678	He	124	“ And maybe if things were different , my answer would be different … ”

20775	20792	20830	20830	He	603	“ This is what you ’re going with , Mia ? That I arranged all this ? ”
20793	20817	20742	20742	hers	602	“ And I do want you to know I ’m flattered , Max . It ’s not that you have n’t impressed me . ”
20843	20866	20867	20867	I	1493	“ Yes , I ’ll cry every night . I ’ll rest my head into the bosoms of supermodels and just weep . ”
20927	20956	20917	20917	You	266	“ All this trouble you went to . I ’m sure you ’ll find a wonderful real - life girlfriend someday who appreciates you the way you deserve … ”

22963	22987	22951	22952	Mia Kelsey	1866	“ Petra canceled her jazz dance class — we have the studio for two hours . The one with the piano . Hurry ! ”
22988	22997	22998	22998	I	1493	“ Oh my god , I ’m there . ”
23010	23024	22998	22998	I	1493	“ Korean fried chicken with spicy dressing . You ’re gon na die . ”
23025	23040	23041	23041	She	1866	“ Smells ... mmm . I ’m eating half now . But only half . ”
23115	23124	23125	23125	she	1866	“ Now I want to eat it alllllll ! ”
23130	23134	23125	23125	she	1866	“ Do n’t . ”
23147	23155	23135	23135	I	1493	“ You ’ll get a side stitch . ”
23156	23163	23164	23164	She	1866	“ Eating does n’t cause those . ”
23169	23190	23191	23191	I	1493	“ I ’m eating it all . So how ’d it go today . Did you reverse - chase him ? ”
23214	23219	23203	23203	I	1493	“ You so rock . ”
23220	23228	23229	23229	We	671	“ Uh , I do n’t know . ”
23240	23245	23229	23229	We	671	“ Did he respond ? ”
23246	23261	23203	23203	I	1493	“ It ’s gon na take a little more oomph to crack that nut . ”
23262	23266	23267	23267	We	671	“ What happened . ”
23280	23328	23267	23267	We	671	“ I acted like I thought he brought me in as a delivery girl as a way of hitting on me , and I was all about letting him down easy . I go , I ’m sorry you went to all this trouble to woo me . ”
23329	23334	23335	23335	she	674	“ To woo you , ”
23338	23342	23335	23335	she	674	“ Love it . ”
23343	23377	23390	23390	she	674	“ I was really going for it . Just putting up this wall of belief , as though my reality is so much stronger than his . Like he says in the book . ”
23378	23389	23390	23390	she	674	“ Which is something you ’re actually very good at , ”
23393	23403	23390	23390	she	674	“ You know you have a talent for that . ”
23404	23454	23335	23335	she	674	“ Well , he was n’t all that moved . He opened with disbelief — he was all , ‘ that ’s what you ’re going with ? Really ? ’ and eventually he moved on to informing me that he ’d be weeping into the bosoms of supermodels . ”
23455	23460	23461	23461	Kelsey	1866	“ What a pig , ”
23464	23477	23478	23478	We	675	“ But maybe you were getting to him . Maybe a little ? ”
23485	23492	23478	23478	We	675	“ He did n’t show it . ”
23493	23532	23335	23335	she	674	“ Well do n’t forget — the target will act like they would n’t ever even give you the time of day . But they ’ll keep on engaging you , and that ’s how you ’ll know . ”
23533	23544	23545	23545	We	675	“ I wo n’t give up , do n’t worry . ”
23572	23581	23560	23560	We	675	“ He ’s messed with the wrong Jerseygirl . ”
23582	23587	23588	23588	Kelsey	1866	“ Yeah , motherfucker ! ”
23591	23602	23603	23603	I	1493	“ Do n’t you flip my girl ’s bitch switch . ”
23606	23616	23603	23603	I	1493	“ Though he has been giving me great tips . ”
23617	23623	23624	23624	she	1866	“ He ’s a billionaire , ”
23627	23642	23624	23624	she	1866	“ Billionaires and celebs have to tip extravagantly or people think they ’re cheap . ”
23643	23646	23647	23647	We	675	“ True . ”
23664	23676	23677	23677	she	1866	“ I still ca n’t picture him as a goofy cowboy , ”
23686	23695	23677	23677	she	1866	“ He was great as a goofy cowboy . ”
23696	23724	23624	23624	she	1866	“ How did you guys even co - exist in a summer production . And what was he doing there anyway ? If he was mister classical ? ”
23725	23762	23677	23677	she	1866	“ It was part of a crossing genres requirement . Where a teacher puts you in a production out of your comfort zone and the other kids have to help you . He was my lead . ”
23763	23771	23772	23772	She	1866	“ Wait , you were leads together ? ”
23778	23787	23772	23772	She	1866	“ You did n’t tell me that part . ”
23788	23815	23816	23816	We	680	“ Yup . I had to play a poor rube in love with Max . And him in love with me . It was … whatever . ”
23824	23831	23832	23832	she	1866	“ It does n’t sound whatever , ”
23838	23842	23843	23843	I	1493	“ It was , ”
23902	23913	23898	23898	She	1866	“ This music is mellow — what do we need ? ”
23914	23918	23919	23919	I	1493	“ Back grooves ! ”
23935	23941	23922	23922	She	1866	“ You were romantic leads . ”
23942	23945	23946	23946	I	1493	“ Yup , ”
23949	24011	23946	23946	I	1493	“ And it was a summer show , and summer shows are always weird , like this one was full of younger kids , mostly from other schools . It felt like we were stranded on a deserted island , away from our friends . It was the one time we got along . Or I thought we were getting along . ”
24012	24017	24018	24018	She	1866	“ Define getting along . ”
24037	24064	24028	24028	We	683	“ Okay , I ’m going to confess something to you here — we had kind of a fling . Or , I thought we did . ”
24073	24077	24065	24065	Kelsey	1866	“ Excuse me ? ”
24078	24096	24018	24018	She	1866	“ Not a full - blown fling . More like , the stage kisses were getting hot . ”
24097	24100	24101	24101	We	683	“ Switch ! ”
24110	24113	24101	24101	We	683	“ And ? ”
24114	24171	24065	24065	Kelsey	1866	“ Let ’s just say we rehearsed the kiss a lot . It was a joke with us — even knocking around backstage , one of us would say , we need to practice that kiss . And we ’d make out . And we ’d get bubble tea afterwards and do homework together and stuff . ”
24172	24175	24176	24176	she	1866	“ Mia , ”
24179	24187	24176	24176	she	1866	“ You had a fling with him . ”
24188	24240	24065	24065	Kelsey	1866	“ I do n’t think it was a fling to him . To him it was more like , he was trapped in an uncool musical with an uncool girl . I was the only person his age there . It was a game for him , as it turned out . ”
24241	24249	24250	24250	I	1493	“ This guy is unbelievable . Switch ! ”
24359	24370	24371	24371	I	1493	“ My heart would just hammer to think about him , ”
24374	24390	24391	24391	She	1866	“ The force of my crush on him could ’ve powered a small nuclear sub . ”
24402	24419	24420	24420	I	1493	“ I had this stupid idea that the production of Oklahoma ! was the real him , ”
24426	24455	24420	24420	I	1493	“ I thought that I was the only person who knew the real him , and all the rest of his life was the false him . Wrong . ”
24456	24463	24391	24391	She	1866	“ He was just playing you . ”
24464	24587	24420	24420	I	1493	“ And then school was back in session , and it was the worst . Our texting had been sparse . That should ’ve been an alarm bell . And finally I spotted him at lunch , sitting with his crew . And this happiness just filled me . I had this tray full of spaghetti , and I rushed over there . And he had this weird look on his face . And I started feeling all nervous , and then I was n’t looking where I was going and I tripped and fell on my ass with spaghetti all over my shirt . And my face and hair . And the whole lunchroom erupted in laughter . I was mortified . ”
24588	24592	24420	24420	I	1493	“ And Max ? ”
24593	24620	24420	24420	I	1493	“ He did nothing . He just watched . My friends rushed to my side , but it ’s like he did n’t care at all . ”
24621	24627	24628	24628	He	686	“ Did you confront him ? ”
24672	25261	24669	24669	you	688	” After our warm - up , we move onto my dance for my audition , a combination of contemporary and classical ballet moves we worked out , and Kelsey picked the music . There are a few combinations I have n’t been nailing , so we concentrate on those . I ’m dead on my feet an hour later . Luckily , it ’s switch - off time . I seat myself at the piano and take Kelsey through her vocal warm - up . We ’ve chosen Midnight Blue as her audition song , but we think if it goes well , the casting director might ask her to sing Blow , Gabriel , Blow , so we ’re preparing that one , too . Getting this show would be so major . As in breakout major . People are saying it ’s going to be the next Waitress . Maybe even the next Hamilton . The group behind it has had massive hits before , so who knows ? Needless to say , the best actors are vying to get a part in this production . Sometimes I ’m afraid to hope for landing the part of confident , sassy Reno , like am I dreaming too big ? But when people who know the show hear I ’m going out for it , their eyes light up . It ’s a very me part . At home I eat rice and cheese and watch YouTube videos . I go to bed early to read , but eventually the evil phone is calling and I ’m on Max ’s Instagram feed . Why I bother , I do n’t know . I guess I have this desire to find out something vulnerable and sensitive about him . A post where he is n’t perfect , either . Where he shows his belly . Some of the posts are familiar to me from late - night Instagram scrolls , or let ’s just call them drunk scroll . There ’s Max with the captain of his yacht . They ’re standing in front of a giant steering wheel and Max ’s hair is all windblown , his cheeks are kissed by the sun and he ’s in a perfectly worn - out T - shirt with some sort of rugged tan shorts , making the captain look like a sad vision of manhood indeed . Caption : Rough weather ahead . Prepare the martini shakers . There ’s a series of pictures of him kissing a short woman with dark , curly hair — definitely not a supermodel . Caption : Happy Saturday . So not the Max Hilton type . I always felt sure it was one of his fans . I scroll past Max sitting in the front row of some basketball game next to the coolest movie stars ever . Caption : Down five points ! Judging by the outpouring of sympathy in the comments , you ’d ’ve thought he was a child trapped in a mine shaft hundreds of feet below the earth ’s surface . There ’s Max the fierce entrepreneur , hands planted on a drafting table , necktie loosened just enough that you can get a hit of his corded neck , and from that infer an entire body of muscular perfection . He ’s surrounded by fiercely photogenic twenty and thirty - somethings in an array of genders , set against the grunge - chic background of his “
25265	25737	24669	24669	you	688	” Caption : Never feels like working when you ’re doing what you love . There ’s an arty shot of a woman in an elevator , head tipped back against the panel , as if in pleasure — you ca n’t see her face because of the light from the elevator chandelier reflected just above her , but a man ’s hand is planted on the panel next to her . Caption : This elevator has everything it needs except a well - stocked liquor cart . Max at work , surrounded by models , and they ’re all laughing their heads off — one guy is doubled over . Caption : Shoot crew made my day . I definitely feel like that caption lies ; if you study the picture long enough , you can see that their energy is directed at him , like he said something funny . He made the shoot crew ’s day , not the other way around , but Max is clever like that . It made him a dangerous enemy . There ’s Max holding a lady ’s hand over a candlelit table . The hand is all of her that we see — the rest of her is cut off , because it ’s Max we care about . But presumably it ’s a Max Hilton girl , possibly it ’s Lana , his most famous Max Hilton girl , the model with a really successful line of capes and boots that even Antonio had heard of . Whoever it is , she has pretty blue fingernails and wears several vintage cocktail rings . And Max gazes intensely across the table at her with an expression that is so full of desire , it makes my heart hurt . Caption : No words . I tell myself it ’s not the girl he ’s looking at , but that ’s a lie , because if you trace the line of his gaze and triangulate from her hand , it ’s obvious that he ’s staring right at her face . But who can say what she ’s doing with the other hand ? I decide she ’s holding a pork chop in front of her face with her other hand , and she ’s about to bite into it . And it ’s the pork chop — and not her — that Max is staring at , lusting over . New Caption : Why the hell did n’t I order the pork chops ? I wonder if she ’ll trade with me . I am Max Hilton , after all . I shut off Instagram . Max Hilton ’s Instagram feed is not helping my mood . But then there ’s that slice of his tower , right out my window . “
25747	25928	25740	25740	I	1493	” I say . I give his tower the finger and go get my uniform . I empty the sequins out of my pocket from when I ripped them off my ears in fury — oh my god how Max would ’ve loved to see that . Carefully , I sew them back onto my ears . Because I ’m doing this thing . I ’m fighting him on behalf of all the women who ended up going home with losers because of his stupid book . I sit in bed , hand - sewing them on . I do n’t care what it takes , I ’ll keep alpha - signaling and reverse - chasing and all of the rest until Max sees what he ’s done . 7 Women are like dogs . They enjoy knowing you ’re in charge . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia Sienna slips from her pose of leisure into a pose of attentiveness when I arrive at today ’s meet place . “

26048	26095	26037	26037	You	689	” I say , feeling happy that I could help pretty Sienna . We may be in bitter competition for musical theater roles , but we ’re a family at Meow Squad ; one of us getting better tips does n’t take away from the others . “
26113	26114	26037	26037	You	689	” “
26119	26123	26037	26037	You	689	” I say . “

26134	26790	26127	26127	yours	689	” she says , resuming her picture - perfect pose of leisure . Neither of us want to reveal what we ’re wearing . The audition outfit is a delicate balance — you want to feel like that character to the casting director , but it ’s a rookie move to go full - on dressing the part . Sienna could be real competition . She has a bell - like voice and perfect diction . She has a big ballet pedigree , too , but I ’m the better overall singer , and a way better soprano . A few hours later , I ’m heading into the lobby of Maximillion Plaza with my trusty cart . I ’ll be doing the Show You ’re in Charge rule , which is exactly what you ’d think it is . It ’s not easy to take charge when you feel like a tiny little plastic figurine living in a snow globe on Max ’s desk . And Max gets to shake up your world and make it snow whenever he pleases . But that does n’t stop me . I have a little something in store for him . I may not be in charge of much , but there is one thing when it comes to Max — his lunch . I practice showing I ’m in charge to the customers on the lower floors . I give people unasked - for mustards when they ’ve ordered sandwiches that should have mustard , and instruct them to use it . Or I override their chips selection , or tell them to eat their cookie before the sandwich . Going bossy like that was scary at first , but people love it . Max ’s book is kind of brilliant , aside from being the pickup guide that helped to ruin Kelsey ’s life . There ’s a sweet guy on the twentieth floor who has lots of Blade Runner stuff in his office . The first day he was all , the cat thing is working for you ! and we had a charming exchange . Today I tell him he has to eat his barbecue chips after he eats his sandwich , because otherwise it spoils the taste , and I ’m very firm about it . He seems surprised , but then we bond over Blade Runner , and I tell him I ’ll be calling him Blade from now on . Blade is the kind of guy I ’d normally fall for if Max was n’t looming up there , poised for another round of his favorite new game , jerky billionaire vs. delivery cat . Playboy billionaire executive and supposed woman expert Max Hilton is on the phone when I arrive . I busy myself with my cart . It ’s a problem that he ’s on the phone — I need him to be paying attention . I ’ve taken the liberty of changing his order . He ’ll be eating a lunch of my choosing . He motions to the corner of his desk , not even looking at me . Like I ’m a dog who needs a hand signal to understand that the master needs his food laid out . So arrogant . I look away , because maybe I ca n’t be bothered to glance at him . Looking away turns out to be worse , because there ’s that giant photo of models hanging all over him . I avert my eyes after a quick , hate - drenched glance . Those models need to buy a clue about the cynical , soulless robot they have their sights set on . I go around and extract the sandwich and work really hard on flattening the bag out to form his little placemat . He ’s talking scheduling , something about Tuesday night being out . “
26808	27280	26127	26127	yours	689	” Slowly I unwrap his sandwich . I ’m detecting a definite emotional charge around this Tuesday - after - work thing . Somehow , I know he ’s lying . It ’s not like I interacted with Max all that much in high school in terms of volume — aside from Oklahoma ! , anyway , but I interacted with him a lot in terms of intensity . The relationship of prey and predator is a fierce form of intimacy , especially in high school . I watched him closely . Listened to conversations across the halls and classrooms with rapt attention , tuning out all else . And it was n’t just real - time stuff ; I kept his every utterance alive in my mind for later dissection and analysis . Understanding your enemy is an important survival skill . So I really think he ’s lying to whoever is on the other line . Foundation commitment is the sort of vague term a man like Max would use as a lie . Maybe he ’s really going to be out having a foursome with his three best friends ’ wives . Or visiting a children ’s hospital dressed as an evil clown . I set the sandwich he did n’t order on the perfectly flattened bag - bed , showing meticulous care , adjusting it just so . I ’m close enough to feel the heat of him , the electricity of him , and something else — annoyance , maybe . Anger . Some high emotion . It feels amazing . I do n’t know why , it just does . I decide to push things even further by making presentation hands , like a game - show hostess presenting a special prize . A muscle in Max ’s jaw fires . I bite back a smile , imagining how Sienna ’s jaw would drop if she saw me doing the presentation hands like this . Especially if she knew that this was n’t even the sandwich Max ordered . I spin around and go back to my cart . I can literally feel his eyes on me , like an angry caress , waking up my skin . Probably mocking my outfit in his mind . The only good thing about my outfit is the short multipocket apron that covers most of my middle and is designed to hold utensils and stirrers and salt packets and things , and in my case , it doubles as a really effective tummy hider . I fuss in my cart , like I ca n’t find something , trying not to smile or laugh . I sneak a glance . Quickly he looks away . My pulse races . He totally has n’t noticed the sandwich , yet . “
27294	27394	27395	27395	You	692	” I hear the click of the latest model of iPhone being set on a soulless glass surface . Call ended . Most people say goodbye when they hang up , but Max dwells in a special world where people do n’t say goodbye when they get off the phone . They just hang up . Like in movies . I finger the smooth packets of mustard feeling his gaze on my back . The sensation is physical , as if the Lycra cat suit has taken on an electric charge , making my skin underneath feel intensely alive . “
27399	27406	27395	27395	You	692	” he asks . I turn . “
27409	27418	27395	27395	You	692	” He tips his head at the wall . “
27444	27448	27395	27395	You	692	” I snort . “
27452	27453	27395	27395	You	692	” “
27500	27501	27503	27505	those poor women	694	” “
27515	27526	27527	27527	I	1493	” I ask . He leans back , so cool . “
27542	27595	27527	27527	I	1493	” Heat steals over my face . Is he dating one of them ? All of them ? I ca n’t think of what to say back . Never mind ; he ’s looking down . He ’s noticed the sandwich . I bite back a smile as he lifts the bun . “
27600	27601	27527	27527	I	1493	” “
27617	27618	27619	27619	I	1493	” “
27630	27677	27619	27619	I	1493	” I fix him with a steady gaze . Max ’s book stresses the importance of believing in yourself , or at least looking like you do . Fake it until you make it is a recurring theme , though he never puts it like that . “
27684	27689	27678	27678	I	1493	” I say sweetly , “
27706	27707	27699	27699	You	1493	” “
27721	27722	27699	27699	You	1493	” “
27725	27729	27699	27699	You	1493	” He frowns . “
27738	27749	27699	27699	You	1493	” I tilt my head , all sunshine and innocence . “
27786	27797	27798	27798	You	1493	” He looks between me and the sandwich , baffled . “
27803	27837	27798	27798	You	1493	” I cock my head , feeling happy and excited . Max needs to do a revised edition of his book , because nowhere does it say how crazy fun the process is . “
27844	28051	27798	27798	You	1493	” The secret truth is , he will like it best . Not only is it the objectively superior meal , but it matches his taste . I might not be able to tell you what my best friend in junior year preferred for lunch , but I can tell you what kinds of food Max always went for , yet another unfortunate side effect of the kind of concentration it took to be enemies with him . I ’m excited for him to take a bite . Not that my life ’s goal is for him to have a delicious sandwich , but I like the idea that he ’ll see I ’m right . I ’m showing him that I ’m superior . I ’m in charge of the entire world . I ’m X - ing that box off like a boss ! He stands . Gives me a hard look . Max was always much taller than me , maybe that ’s why he stands . To intimidate me from across the room . Shivers go over me . Does he think he can intimidate me ? Or is it more than that ? He comes around his desk . I swallow . “
28060	28088	28089	28089	I	1493	” He keeps coming at me , eyes on mine . My skin tightens as he nears . This process is getting more exciting by the second . “
28110	28165	28103	28103	I	1493	” He keeps coming until he ’s right in front of me . I gaze up into his eyes , awash in a feeling of hilarity and something else — a strange alertness . My nipples strain at the fabric of the cat suit . What ’s up with the AC in this place ? “
28177	28199	28202	28202	I	1493	” he grumbles . My heart is basically banging out of my chest at this point . I swallow with difficulty . “
28219	28270	28210	28210	I	1493	” Emotion flares in his eyes . It ’s been forever since I ’ve been this close to Max . Forever since I studied the stray brown fleck in one of his otherwise intensely blue eyes , pale at the center , like a ring of ice formed in there . “
28280	28293	28277	28277	I	1493	” he gusts out , his words like feathers on my forehead . “
28305	28310	28298	28298	Max	266	” I enunciate sassily , “
28315	28316	28298	28298	Max	266	” “
28323	28327	28298	28298	Max	266	” he says , “
28338	28339	28330	28330	you	697	” “
28343	28347	28330	28330	you	697	” I say , “
28371	28673	28330	28330	you	697	” Something in the way he looks at me changes ; his nostrils flare , and for a crazy second , I think he ’s going to kiss me . For a crazy second , I want him to . I ’m the amazing one , I think . I ’m the one you missed out on . The moment stretches on . I do n’t know where we ’ve gone , but the sandwich is nowhere to be seen . Suddenly he straightens . He turns and walks the few feet back to his desk , him and his perfect suit . I stand there gawking , thinking he probably requests his suits be made a little too tight through the shoulders in order to give the optical illusion of a perfect body , strong and lithe and predatorial like a lion , accentuated by the finest fabric . Only the best will do when it comes to kissing and cupping Max Hilton ’s muscular torso as he prowls his office . He grabs the sandwich and turns , leans back , butt against the desk , eyes boring into mine . Then he takes a bite , eyes never leaving mine . My stomach tightens as he chews . I have a lot of customers to attend to , a lot more tips to get for myself . I have the Edgar building next . If I take too long , people will be mad . But none of that matters . I ’m furious with excitement and something that feels strangely like happiness . He chews , looking deliberative . And then his gaze drops to the sandwich . He thinks it ’s delicious — I can tell . I feel like my smile might crack my face . “
28676	28686	28330	28330	you	697	” He looks back up . Narrows his eyes . “
28691	28695	28330	28330	you	697	” I say . “
28701	28748	28698	28699	your daddy	699	” He snorts , and for a second , he ’s not my enemy . For a second , it feels amazing to have introduced him to this sandwich , one of my personal favorites . He dabs the sides of his mouth with a napkin . “
28755	28780	28698	28699	your daddy	699	” He watches me . Battling with himself , no doubt . Trying to find some loophole where it ’s not true , maybe . “
28786	28787	28698	28699	your daddy	699	” “
28796	28833	28698	28699	your daddy	699	” Before I know what I ’m doing , I go to him , enter his force field of smooth , suave perfection . I have this crazy feeling like I need to break through it . “
28840	28841	28698	28699	your daddy	699	” “
28844	28856	28698	28699	your daddy	699	” he says . One word . Voice calm like steel . “
28870	29303	28698	28699	your daddy	699	” I ’m joking around , but his stern gaze is locked on mine in a way that ’s anything but jokey . The floor seems to dip beneath my feet . Slowly , without warning , he reaches up and touches the side of my face — one lone fingertip . A featherlight touch that sizzles . He holds my gaze with those eyes , the bluest of blue with that pale ring of ice , and slowly draws his fingertip along the edge of my jaw , heading for my chin . I feel like he ’s looking into my soul with those eyes . The air thickens between us . My sex turns molten with excitement . I should laugh at him and push his hand away , but it ’s the last thing I want . Do n’t stop is more my thinking . I ’m nearly panting by the time he reaches my chin , but his wicked finger is n’t finished . It ’s a knuckle now , and it ’s reversing course , slowly trailing backwards across my hyper - sensitive cheek . I ’m dizzy with the gentle sweetness of his touch , like he ’s petting a tiny wild bird . Neither of us says a word , as though that might break the spell . My breath is quick and shallow — okay , I ’m panting — but hopefully not that he can see or hear . Every molecule in my entire being is focused on the progress of his knuckle . Yearning for more . I keep my face neutral when all I want is to turn into his hand . I do n’t even know how I resist . All I want to do is give him everything . Finally his finger of amazement reaches the tender skin below my ear ; then and only then does he stop . He gazes at me even more deeply , as if that ’s possible . Something in my belly melts . I have no breath . He leans in and presses his lips to my cheek . One tiny brush of a kiss . A seismic event in my belly . Somewhere on the other side of the globe in some tiny island nation , Richter scales are going crazy . Animals are racing into the hills . Nobody understands what has happened . But it ’s me , standing in this Manhattan office tower , cracking apart in shards of pure lust . He pulls back , watching me . “
29315	29347	29308	29308	you	701	” I say . His lips quirk in a half smile . It ’s a smile that I have n’t seen for years , and it lights something deep in me . “
29351	29394	29349	29349	you	701	” It comes to me that he ’s thanking me for the sandwich . It seems like madness , but yes , what else is he talking about ? I put on a sarcastic expression . Like he ’s such a freak . “
29401	29406	29349	29349	you	701	” His lip twitches . “
29414	29418	29421	29421	you	701	” he says . “
29424	29502	29503	29503	You	701	” I give him a look . Do n’t you dare — that ’s what my look says . You ca n’t make me show you the chips array . You ca n’t be an asshole after that . He circles his finger . Heat fills my face . I go back to my cart , grab a bag of cheesy puffs , and toss them at him . He catches them , eyes never leaving mine . “
29520	29521	29523	29523	’em	703	” “
29528	29536	29523	29523	’em	703	” He stares at me a bit . “
29548	29549	29523	29523	’em	703	” “
29552	29796	29523	29523	’em	703	” I grab my cart and turn , pulse racing . 8 Show her you ’re the one in charge by creating a system of rewards for good behavior and demerits for behavior you do n’t like . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia I attend an acting seminar over the weekend and take off Monday to do some work as a film extra , which goes late into the evening . I do n’t get home until after three in the morning , which I ’m a little unhappy about . I wanted to be well rested for Tuesday . But even on five hours of sleep , I ’m feeling strangely chipper , and looking forward to doing some more of Max ’s system . I do n’t know how to feel about the way he touched me on Friday . All weekend I ’ve been processing it , which is basically a euphemism for replaying it over and over in my mind as butterflies do loop - de - loops in my chest . Today I ’ll be doing rewards and demerits . He ’ll hate it . I smile whenever I imagine how much he ’ll hate it . In his book , Max suggests giving the woman a Hershey ’s Kiss whenever she does something you like . To get her to associate pleasure with being agreeable . “
29801	29812	29523	29523	’em	703	” Kelsey had exclaimed when I read that part aloud . “
29820	29898	29523	29523	’em	703	” Tell her playfully that she has to earn her chocolate candy . She wo n’t like it and will probably find ways to resist , but hold your ground . Do what you need to do to stay in the alpha position — you are the judge of her , the one who gives rewards for good behavior . If you feel your control slipping , simply give another reward for something . Or a demerit . “
29910	29919	29925	29925	sister	706	” Kelsey had said . I just snorted . “
29927	30122	29925	29925	sister	706	” And I wo n’t think about kissing his palm or putting my face to his chest , either ! But I did n’t say that out loud . We decided that following his system exactly would be too obvious . Like if I start giving him Hershey ’s Kisses , it might jog his memory . In order to position myself as approval giver , I ’ve decided to go with a gold - star grading system like they have on Amazon . Max is behind the desk when I get there , the king in his castle . His white shirt fits him just so , his tie slightly loosened , brown hair perfectly tousled . He gives me a smile , but it ’s not his real one . It ’s his Max Hilton smile , the smile of Maximillion magazine ads and billboards above Times Square . Enchanting Max who knows all the fun secrets . Max who wears a tuxedo to the many glamorous events you will never be invited to . Max having fun elsewhere without you . It ’s a beautiful smile that feels like a wall . “
30138	30142	30135	30135	I	1493	” he asks . “
30151	30162	30143	30143	I	1493	” I say . Blue eyes simmer behind lush lashes . “
30167	30347	30163	30163	We	708	” Fun electricity trills through me , much as I try to clamp it down . I proceed , conscious of him watching my every movement . The taking of his sandwich bag from my cart . The bringing of the sandwich to his desk . The extraction of the sandwich , the smoothing out of the bag . I ’ve done lunch layout for hundreds of conferences , but until Max , I ’ve never been so aware of how much I ’m invading somebody ’s space when I do it . I ’ve never felt so acutely the hum of another person ’s nearness . The electric charge of another body up close . He ’s not even pretending to work this time . He just sits there enjoying my servitude . Maybe thinking about the way he touched my cheek . God knows I ’m thinking about it . I blot all sexy thoughts from my mind . I ’m on a mission . I position the knife and fork perfectly . I clear my throat . “
30361	30362	30351	30351	I	1493	” “
30366	30373	30364	30364	you	709	” Max rumbles , velvety cool . “
30386	30391	30364	30364	you	709	” I trail off . “
30395	30396	30397	30397	I	1493	” “
30410	30438	30439	30439	I	1493	” His expression is just a little bit stony ; no sign of emotion whatsoever unless you count that muscle twitching at the side of his jaw . “
30467	30468	30460	30460	I	1493	” “
30477	30482	30473	30473	I	1493	” he says dryly . “
30492	30493	30494	30494	I	1493	” “
30498	30499	30494	30494	I	1493	” “
30517	30547	30494	30494	I	1493	” he asks . Again with the lunch - cart girl . Deep inside my chest , small demons stoke a fire of outrage . Somebody needs a demerit . “
30560	30611	30494	30494	I	1493	” I arrange the mustards , feeling his gaze fixed on me , which makes it difficult to think . I keep thinking about the way he touched me . Feeling the sizzling path of his finger . Imagining primal moves . I nod at the picture on the wall . “
30615	30619	30494	30494	I	1493	” I say . “
30624	30625	30494	30494	I	1493	” “
30653	30877	30633	30633	They	1536	” Everything in him seems to go still , except his eyes , which are busy boring holes in the side of my face . Maybe stunned at how deluded I am . Because let ’s face it , they are all objectively prettier than me . I mean it — they are prettier by every pretty parameter , killing it in the categories of nose - straightness , hair silkiness , and symmetry of features . They especially dominate in the willowiness - of - limbs area , whereas I ’m short and sturdy . My boob size disqualifies me from being able to pull off the drapey dresses they ’re wearing . They might be more fascinating , too . But I ’m going with it , even though , standing there under his stern scrutiny , I feel less and less confident . Never let them smell blood in the water , that ’s one of the concepts in his book that comes to me now . Like women are sharks , always ready to attack . The only shark here is Max , of course . With his harsh good looks and his merciless precision and his billion - dollar empire that eats other billion - dollar empires for lunch . I lower my voice to a confident whisper . “
30909	30916	30633	30633	They	1536	” I adjust my sequined ears . “
30934	30940	30929	30929	I	1493	” He clears his throat . “
30952	30991	30992	30992	We	717	” I sigh like I have a wonderful secret . The world is your cocktail party — that ’s an attitude Max suggests in his book . I actually liked that one — it really resonated with me . “
30996	31068	30992	30992	We	717	” I grab the five bags of chips before he can demand his array . He watches , expression intense . Of course , in the cocktail party I ’m imagining , I ’m not acting as a human sandwich dispenser . I ’m having fun and laughing , and Max is watching me , besotted . And it ’s not because I have a pork chop lifted to my face . “
31077	31087	30992	30992	We	717	” I ask when he does n’t say anything . “
31091	31096	30992	30992	We	717	” he says hoarsely . “
31100	31104	30992	30992	We	717	” I say . “
31122	31484	31485	31485	Mia	1866	” He tightens his jaw as I snatch up an extra bag . I ’m keeping him off - balance . I feel like I ’m really nailing his system today . I head right for him , all the way around his desk , holding his gaze , because that ’s what you do to show a dog that you ’re in charge . It hits me here that holding a man ’s gaze and walking steadily toward him , never looking away , is also an incredibly sexy thing to do . Every inch of my skin feels alive with excitement . He swivels away from his desk as I near , facing me with that strangely serious expression . His shirt cuffs are rolled partway up his muscular forearms . His hands rest on his hard thighs , fingers relaxed . Nails trimmed short . Pianist - short . Some habits die hard . And those thick thumbs . They ’re the same thumbs he stuck in his belt loops while he sang with all of that sweet goofiness during that lost summer . Though science tells us that the cells of the body replace themselves over time — nine years for an entirely new body . So he really is a different person in every way . But god , the way he ’d sing to me . Even when there was a full auditorium , it was as if he was singing to me and me alone , gaze dancing under that floppy hat , red bandana around his neck . And he ’d make these jerky motions , pointing this way and that , singing about how the farm animals will scurry when he gets a surrey with a fringe on top to drive me around in . The song was about young , hopeful love . It ’s how I felt that summer . It meant nothing to him . A dalliance of proximity . The second we were back at school , he went back to his cold and cynical mode . Too cool for me . Quizzically , he tilts his head . “
31487	31511	31485	31485	Mia	1866	” Have I been standing there weirdly long ? If you feel your control slipping , simply give her another reward for something . “
31521	31564	31485	31485	Mia	1866	” I toss one bag onto his desk and pull open the other one with a loud crinkle - snap that splits the air . His eyes flare . I remove one puff from the bag and hold it out to him . “
31567	31574	31485	31485	Mia	1866	” I whisper , pulse racing . “
31580	31701	31485	31485	Mia	1866	” He watches me sternly . Opening for his prize is the last thing he ’s going to do . Nobody pushes Max Hilton around . The book does n’t have instructions for outright rebellion . The book does n’t say how sexy that might be . How a person ’s beauty can squeeze deep into your belly . How you might really want to kiss him . To straddle him . To sink into him and make him remember . Make him come back . I ’ve wrested control away from him , but I do n’t seem to have it , either . Like I flung it out the window . Fly ! Be free ! I swallow . “
31707	31718	31485	31485	Mia	1866	” I nudge his lower lip with the cheese puff . “
31722	31791	31485	31485	Mia	1866	” I say . He grabs my wrist , encircling it snugly and completely with his big , warm hand . My breath quickens . His challenging gaze deepens , like he can see right into me . The bright orange cheese puff falls from my fingers . Slowly , he pulls my hand toward him , pinning me with his eyes . I swallow , mouth dry . “
31801	31832	31833	31833	Somebody	1462	” I whisper . He brushes his lips over my knuckle , soft and warm and smooth as velvet . More shivers . I ’m a fireworks show of shivers . “
31841	31846	31833	31833	Somebody	1462	” I gasp out . “
31856	32359	32364	32364	buddy	722	” A chunk of brown hair has fallen over his eyes , and it ’s unbearably sexy . He kisses my next knuckle , still watching me . I stifle a gasp . Is Max Hilton seducing me ? Yes . My knees tremble . I steel my resolve . Max does n’t get to think he ’s actually seducing me . No way . Not him . But his lips are hovering over my pinky knuckle , and everything between us is electric . God , I need to get control back . I try to think of the book , but I ’m in a canoe heading over a sparkles waterfall , and control is soaring over the treetops . Control does n’t remember me . It will not come when I call . Max ’s eyes are bluer than blue , and his breath is a wisp of silk on my skin . And suddenly I ’m imagining his mouth over other parts of me . Behind those blue eyes I think he ’s thinking it too . I ball the hand that he does n’t have hold of , tightening it against the overwhelming urge to shove it into his hair , to pull his face to my chest . Or maybe just straddle him . He looks down at our joined hands and adjusts his hold , making my hand all the more his . We ’re holding hands . I nearly collapse from the unexpectedness of it . The jaw - dropping sexiness . He looks up and it ’s a bolt through my belly . Holding my gaze , he kisses my pinky knuckle , a brush of a kiss that sends shudders through me . How is this happening ? He ’s taking me over and he has n’t even gotten past my wrist ! He turns my hand so that his lips are over my thumb knuckle . How could I have forgotten about that one ? He ’s now going to kiss my thumb knuckle . I wait , barely breathing . My entire world has collapsed to that thumb knuckle . It cries out for his lips . And omigod , what will he kiss after that ? Images of me stretched naked across his desk crowd through my mind . Flashes of his wicked lips hovering over my belly . Pressing to the space between my legs . My mouth begins to form his name — Max . I ’m not above begging if that gets us moving along . It ’s here I come to my senses . Begging ? Moving along ? What is happening to me ? It comes to me that this is probably what he wanted when he set up these deliveries . Maybe he even wagered on it with Parker — how long will it take ? How many Meow Squad visits until I ’m the main course ? I yank my hand away . “
32370	32407	32364	32364	buddy	722	” I spin around and get back over to my cart , awash in a sense of loss , but you ca n’t trust a man with no heart . He turns back to his computer . “

Doling out rewards and demerits positions you as the approval giver and her as the approval seeker . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia Kelsey ’s there when I get home from work . I peel off my winter clothes , feeling like a fugitive . Am I running from Max ? Or myself ? “
32515	32531	32532	32532	I	1493	” Unbearably sexy comes to mind . Wild . Confusing . Knuckle kisses of wonder . “
32539	32557	32532	32532	I	1493	” I grab the marker and put an X in the mete out rewards and demerits box . “
32567	32583	32558	32558	He	1493	” Kelsey smiles . It ’s nice to see her happy and excited like this . “
32596	32597	32558	32558	He	1493	” “
32637	32638	32624	32624	he	1493	” “
32651	34805	32641	32641	You	724	” This is the part where I should tell her about the knuckle kiss , but I do n’t . I ca n’t . Maybe it ’s cowardly . That afternoon , I set out with my script teed up on my phone , off to wander the streets and memorize lines . And I ’m a little bit avoiding Kelsey . Though I really , really do need to work on my monologue . On the first call with acting and singing auditions , you always go in with your own material , and for my monologue I ’m doing something from Wicked . In order to not look crazy , I wear an iPhone headset , like I ’m talking on the phone . Though if people listen , they ’ll definitely wonder about my sanity . One of the best things about winter is that it gets dark earlier , and you can see in windows , so many windows like bright fishbowls . I walk and I talk , watching the world around me . The way people move , the way they get into cabs or even wait for a light , all of that goes into my tool bag . I people - watched a lot when I first arrived in the city as a freshman attending the Shiz . I ’d especially watch the elegant women . I remember how horrified I was when I realized how little grace I had compared to them . I flopped down on chairs instead of sitting . I slammed my beverages instead of sipping . And I did n’t talk , I spouted off . Worst of all , that brassy laugh . I ’m heading up Ninth Street , running through my piece enough that it ’s in my bones . I try incorporating that tip - of - the - head movement that Max ’s receptionist did , a slight twist of the spine and a tip . It ’s not right in the piece , but it feels very chic . I like it . I go along the edge of the park , just over a mile from our place . I re - tie my scarf against the wind coming across it and head back down 8th , which is a reasonable enough street to take back to our neighborhood , but it ’s also where Maximillion Tower is . I have n’t forgotten the seeming lie I overheard on the phone . I ’ve thought about it on and off over the past weeks . A foundation thing after work on Tuesdays . What does he really have on Tuesday nights ? What is he hiding ? I ca n’t quite shake the feeling he ’s hiding something . It ’s 6:30 PM and Max ’s lights are still on . Most people would have gone home , but Max is there . He always was a hard worker — I saw that up close during the musical . He seemed to have come in with the songs pre - memorized , and he was so serious about getting the blocking right . I huddle in a doorway across the street . Is he working this late ? Or maybe there ’s a supermodel up there , and he ’s saying Max Hilton things to her . You ’re wearing far too many clothes , baby . Come on over here and let ’s get nasty . Or maybe he ’s kissing her knuckles and melting her mind . And she hates how bad she wants him . Standing out there , I ’m thinking that I could just see where he goes . What if he ’s learning to juggle ? Attending a jazz - hands - to - the - oldies class ? These are things I would need to know . Chances are good that he ’ll have a driver pick him up and whisk him off somewhere , and it ’s not like I ’m going to jump into a cab and be all , follow that limo ! Probably . In his book , Max talks about the practice of observation . Guys are stupid and oblivious as a rule . You do n’t have to do much to rise above the competition . You want a book about how to seduce the woman you want ? It ’s written on her face , in her clothes . She tells you with every word she speaks , with every smile . What does she like ? What does she care about ? Open your eyes . Start seeing what ’s in front of your face . Use everything . I wander up and down the long block , keeping an eye on his window , thinking I ’ll just linger for a while . I tell myself it ’s not weird . I tell myself it ’s all in that service of my girlfriends — the more ammunition the better , right ? But really , I just want to know . I ca n’t stop thinking about his half smile , how it feels like a secret smile that ’s just for me . Stupid . His light goes off . I step back into the shadows . A few minutes later , he steps out of the building . No car tonight . He ’s wearing an overcoat and winter hat with ear flaps , pulled low over his forehead . A long scarf slung around his chin . In other words , a disguise . But I ’d recognize that posture anywhere . The angle of his head as he looks around . He turns right and heads along 8th . Will he take the subway ? Does somebody as rich as Max even take a subway ? If it ’s an easy ride , I suppose he might , though following him all the way down and onto the train seems like a pretty big commitment . Hard not to be noticed if it ’s not crowded . And if I ’m not in the car he rides , it ’ll be hard to get off at the stop he gets out at . I channel every action and adventure movie I ever saw as I follow him at a discreet distance , telling myself I ’ll decide when I decide . After high school I ’d keep my ears peeled at parties , curious where he was auditioning . I knew he would n’t go for traditional , more established orchestras or ensembles ; that was n’t Max . He ’d go for something up - and - coming . The sleek and exciting dark horse trio . Something with the edge and cachet to make you go ooooh . My friends and I were surprised when pianists other than Max turned up in those ooooh sorts of positions , whereas Max ’s name was nowhere , not even sitting in for concerts . He was so talented and connected . What was he up to ? Then The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room came out . And there was nothing in his bio about playing piano . Like he ’d erased that whole part of himself . We were all stunned , even more when his guide sold millions of copies , earning him more money in a month than the most musicians make in a lifetime . A lot of us thought he ’d come back to music after that , but instead , he took his mad money and built a global men ’s style empire . Max had more talent in his little finger than most serious musicians and he ’d cast it all aside . Now he has his own jet . And a secret about Tuesday nights . Much to my delight , he passes the 50th Street station and keeps going . I pull out my phone and text Kelsey . I told her about my suspicions , and she as interested as I was . Me : Remember Max ’s secret Tuesday night liaison ? Hot on the trail ! Kelsey : Wut ? Girl ! Me : I was monologue walking and … shrug emoji He takes a few turns , walks maybe a total of six blocks until he arrives at a not - very - special building with a Korean noodles place and a Starbucks on the bottom , and five unmemorable stories up top . Me : Subject has arrived at destination . I text her a map link . Kelsey : Do n’t recall a stalking component in Max ’s book . Me : It ’s there . Know your quarry . I slink back into a doorway , all the better to watch him . He ’s in the doorway on his phone , texting , presumably . I snap a picture and text it to Kelsey . Kelsey : That is no foundation meeting ! He looks up , then turns and leans back against the wall . Waiting ? Is he picking somebody up ? Going in ? The lights in the building are all off except the fifth floor . The door opens suddenly . A statuesque woman with bright blonde hair comes out . Max kisses her cheek . My stomach jackknifes as they disappear inside . I fold my arms , laser gaze set on reduce - to - rubble . Me : Some woman came out and let him in . Kelsey : frown emoji I wait , watching for movement or lights to show me where they went . Finally I get what I want — or do n’t want — up on the top floor , a corner window lights up , but three nearby windows go dark . And then I see her back to a window sill . Her hands are out on either side of herself , like she ’s leaning back and talking to somebody in there . I punch the address into Google and get a series of hits . Eye doctors on the second floor ; accountants , fabric wholesaler on the fourth and then a hit on Suite 500 , the fifth floor . It ’s a yoga studio . Namaste Way . Sure enough , there ’s a neon lotus on the farthest window . The whole half of this side of the top floor is a yoga studio . Me : They went into a yoga studio and turned most of the lights off . Kelsey : frown emoji Me : Private yoga lessons ? In secret ? Kelsey : But why ? ? ? ? ? ? The woman moves away from the window . I wait a few minutes . Then the neon lotus goes out . Moments pass . Me : No more movement . What are they doing ? Kelsey : Why does a man ever meet a woman in secret ? Me : Then why not a hotel ? Kelsey : Perhaps he is an exceptionally acrobatic lover ? Something clenches around my heart . Kelsey : Naked yoga ? Troll doll full - costume sex fetish films ? Me : Shit ! I was watching the window and somebody else went in ! Kelsey : Did you see who ? Me : IDK could ’ve been more than one person . Kelsey : Erp . A few minutes later , somebody else emerges from the front door , all bundled up . The blonde . She turns and walks down the street . Max does n’t come out . And the corner window up there is still lit . I report back to Kelsey . Did those new people join him ? I check the back of the building , but the yoga studio is the only lit - up area . What does Max do in a yoga studio by himself that he has to lie about ? He has a palatial apartment on Central Park ; I ’ve seen the photos . If he wanted a yoga studio , he ’d have a yoga studio there . I wait for a bit more , then I give up , cold and hungry . On the way home , I Google Namaste Way . The blonde is the owner , a former gymnast turned yoga teacher , which is n’t a big surprise in terms of career progression . Kelsey and I eat cereal and discuss the new mystery . She ’s wrangled another donation from another Max Hilton book victim . The woman wants me to know that I ’m doing God ’s work . “

And then it turns to him throwing the yoga teacher up against the wall in the dark stairwell and kissing her . Which is basically like a furious scribble in my mind . In unrelated news , I suggest that maybe it ’s time for Antonio , and Kelsey ’s texting him before I can even finish my admittedly weak rationale for my change of heart . Fifteen minutes later , Antonio ’s in our living room modeling a three - piece suit he plans to wear for his star turn , hair - that - shall - not - be - touched perfectly tousled . It ’s as if he lounges around his apartment looking like he stepped right off the pages of a men ’s magazine . Kelsey bites her lip , beaming at him . “

You do n’t give a shit what she thinks . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia I call Rollins to try and persuade him to use the Maximillion Plaza block as the relay point — I suggest a spot that will be in perfect view of Max walking across the street for his pre - lunch visit . It ’s just a block over from where we usually are . Rollins is not so sure — in addition to the innocent - country - boy - in - the - city thing he has going on , he ’s a dedicated rule follower . Rollins never met a rule he does n’t want to marry in a little white chapel on a windswept prairie . I promise him I ’ll tell the other delivery cats and take all the heat , and he finally agrees . I arrange my delivery schedule so that I can meet Antonio out there just before eleven . The timing works like clockwork , which I guess is the point of using a clock . Rollins brings me a new cart and switches out the old like the Indy 500 pit crew of sandwich delivery that he is . I ’m refilling the chips and utensils just as Antonio arrives in his beautiful suit . “
36020	36040	36041	36041	I	1493	” Rollins asks , because Antonio looks more like somebody we ’d deliver to than somebody we ’d know . “
36046	36051	36041	36041	I	1493	” Antonio says darkly . “
36057	36058	36063	36063	he	1493	” “
36068	36099	36063	36063	he	1493	” I explain . Antonio slides his hand up the side of the truck , gazing down at me . It ’s a smoldering , sensual , uniquely male stance . “
36107	36111	36105	36105	cara	111	” he says . “
36129	36149	36122	36122	We	748	” Rollins straightens , nervously restocking chips . I widen my eyes at Antonio . Antonio turns to Rollins . “
36171	36172	36155	36155	her	750	” “
36175	36179	36180	36180	Antonio	549	” Rollins says . “
36186	36187	36188	36188	Pah	154	” “
36217	36227	36228	36228	I	1493	” He turns to a wide - eyed Rollins . “
36256	36257	36249	36249	I	1493	” “
36260	36264	36249	36249	I	1493	” I say . “
36272	36305	36306	36306	I	1493	” Rollins is busying himself with the condiments box . Antonio glances significantly over my shoulder , then back at me , and he turns a thousand - watt smile on me . “
36310	36328	36306	36306	I	1493	” he says , tilting his head , which adds hot - guy dimension to the smile . “
36374	36443	36362	36362	Your	154	” He ’s spotted Max . I pull out my phone and put it on selfie - mode . My breath catches as I see that familiar pair of shoulders behind me . I gaze up at Antonio , who looks down at me besotted . Beatific , even , like a monk , having endured years of darkness for this one chance to gaze upon the divine . “
36456	36460	36362	36362	Your	154	” he whispers . “
36465	36480	36481	36481	You	757	” I smile back at him . Now I ’m turning on the drama . “
36486	36490	36481	36481	You	757	” I say . “
36496	36500	36493	36493	I	1493	” he says . “
36508	36520	36505	36505	I	1493	” I ’m also relieved that there was no weird confrontation . “
36538	36544	36531	36531	You	757	” Acting , he means . “
36553	36564	36531	36531	You	757	” Antonio sighs and shoves his hands into his pockets . “
36567	36571	36531	36531	You	757	” I ask . “
36576	36582	36531	36531	You	757	” I lower my voice . “
36589	36590	36591	36591	I	1493	” “
36603	36604	36596	36596	He	757	” “
36619	36931	36932	36932	You	758	” Antonio looks at me sadly . Rollins stands behind him , fussing with a cart , a look of alarm etched upon his features . I execute my deliveries for Maximillion Plaza at peak efficiency , getting peak tips . I never looked forward to my route this much before . Blade , the guy on the twentieth floor who really loves that movie , is excited about the whitefish I recommended . He ’s been talking me up on the floor and it ’s suddenly my most lucrative floor . He asks me whether I ’m appearing in any shows coming up and I tell him about my upcoming audition for Anything Goes . He ’s sure I ’ll get it . By the elevators on Blade ’s floor , there ’s a pair of enlarged photos of Max . In one of them , he ’s looking bored in a fabulous suit , sprawled on a kingly piece of furniture . A woman stands behind him with her hand in his hair . My belly grinds at the sight . Which just goes to show the devastating power of prize - positioning . Max has many flaws , but ignorance was never one of them . I only wish he ’d seen Antonio admiring me , so that I could be prize - positioned , too . What did all of that maneuvering get me instead ? Rollins thinks I ’m dating my murderous gigolo cousin . But I really want to be able to X off a golden - rule box today . I ’m thinking about the Do Something Outrageous one . My gaze falls to the twelve bags of cheesy puffs still in my cart . A plan starts to form . On the twenty - second floor I start giving the cheesy puffs away . “
36939	37280	37281	37281	Meow	759	” I say to my excited customers . I ’ll have to settle up with the Meow Squad powers that be , but who cares about obstacles like that when you ’re on the do - something - outrageous warpath ? I strategically work it out as only a delivery cat can so that I have precisely one bag left when I get into the elevator going up to his floor . One of the willowy , statuesque receptionists is riding with me ; I ’d hoped to have privacy for this part of my plan , but then again , it ’s not like people sit around staring at each other in elevators , right ? Elevators are a zone of ignoring each other . I retreat to the back of the elevator and pull open the last cheesy puff bag and stuff a handful into my mouth , allowing bright orange crumbs to cascade down my shirt . I stifle a grin , imagining Max ’s face after I tell him I ’m out of cheesy puffs and he specifically sees them all over my front . I shove another bunch in , kind of smashing them into my mouth , so that they get into my hair a little bit . It ’s right about here that I realize the statuesque beauty is watching me in the reflection of one of the slim , highly polished panels . She quickly looks away . My pulse races . I think about saying something , but what ? There are some instances when explaining an awkward thing will only make it more awkward . Finally the elevator arrives at the top floor . She gets out first and walks off — eager , perhaps , to tell her willowy , statuesque co - workers the cautionary tale of the lunch - cart girl . I keep Kelsey ’s faith in me in mind as I knock on Max ’s door wearing a cat suit full of orange cheesy puffs . “
37284	37315	37281	37281	Meow	759	” There ’s a largish puff right on the center of my chest , a bright orange badge of outrageousness . I ’m so X - ing off that box . “
37318	37326	37281	37281	Meow	759	” he says . I push in . “
37350	37405	37335	37335	I	1493	” Max has his jacket off again , his tie is a little bit loose , and his dress shirt is tight over his sternly crossed arms , creating a definite guns - n - stuff effect . Arm muscles ahoy . Just looking at him makes my head feel light . He says , “
37425	37470	37471	37471	I	1493	” I snort , as if that ’s so uncool , though in my own personal hierarchy of pop culture references , Jean - Luc Picard beats Deckard from Blade Runner . Leave it to Max . I pull his lunch from my cart . “
37480	37507	37471	37471	I	1493	” I go around without his telling me to . I flatten out the bag , feeling his stare , hungry and heavy on my skin . “
37527	37642	37471	37471	I	1493	” I say . I ’m thinking about the knuckles kiss , much as I ’m trying not to . He probably forgot about it by now . A brief knuckle kiss is just a drop of water in the vast ocean of Max Hilton ’s daily moves . His arms are still lusciously crossed . I imagine flattening the shirt fabric over them , smoothing the shirt so that it perfectly outlines the contours of his muscles , and then I ’d smooth some more , soft fabric over steely strength , like a party for my hands . And then maybe my lips could get involved . And then maybe my teeth . “
37665	37666	37654	37654	You	761	” “
37673	37674	37669	37669	I	1493	” “

37736	37767	37695	37695	I	1493	” I place a napkin and knife and fork next to his new sandwich . He knows exactly what it means . Ordering from the Meow Squad . Requesting me . “
37776	37799	37695	37695	I	1493	” he asks . I still . He saw Antonio and me out there ? Was he pretending he did n’t see ? “
37803	37804	37695	37695	I	1493	” “
37808	37812	37695	37695	I	1493	” he snorts . “
37827	37870	37817	37818	Hugo Boss	112	” I get the sense he ’s going for lightness in the strapping fella bit , but it sounds slightly adversarial , too . Is he jealous ? Excitement surges through me . I ’ve never been somebody excited by jealousy before . “
37873	37880	37881	37881	Antonio	549	” I say with faraway eyes . “
37883	37943	37881	37881	Antonio	549	” I ’m stoking it now . What ’s going on with me ? I continue my machinations , reveling in his covetous gaze . I set out his mustards with my usual flourish . He picks up a pen , moves it carelessly around in his fingers . His hands really are large . And warm and soft . “
37946	37950	37881	37881	Antonio	549	” he says . “
37953	37954	37957	37957	Antonio	549	” “

38029	38048	38014	38014	I	1493	” I say . I set a bag of Lay ’s plain potato chips next to his sandwich . “
38053	38062	38014	38014	I	1493	” He picks them up , brow furrowed . “
38068	38069	38014	38014	I	1493	” “
38090	38096	38097	38097	Ungh	159	” He shakes his head . “
38099	38119	38097	38097	Ungh	159	” I go back to the cart and pluck out four bags of chips . I hold them up . “
38135	38136	38097	38097	Ungh	159	” “
38142	38143	38144	38144	I	1493	” “
38148	38160	38144	38144	I	1493	” He zeroes in on the bright orange cheesy puff crumbs . “
38169	38186	38144	38144	I	1493	” I show him the empty cheesy puffs box , quivering with maybe too much excitement . “
38197	38289	38144	38144	I	1493	” I bite my tongue — hard — applying intense , anti - laughter pressure . He stands . I ’m fighting not to smile . Bite bite bite . He ’s coming for me . I back up . He keeps coming . I ’m a deer in the blazing headlights . If a deer ate the car ’s dinner . And the car is barreling down the road . I hit the wall . His hands hit the wall on either side of me . My knees are jelly . “
38297	38360	38295	38295	Mia	1866	” I can feel his warmth deep in my chest — it ’s like he has his own personal force field . His eyes bore into mine , and then he drops his gaze to my shirt . My pulse pounds . He picks a bit of cheesy puff off my chest and holds it between us , evidence of my impudence . “
38367	38374	38375	38375	I	1493	” Excited shivers rain over me . “
38378	38446	38447	38447	You	768	” I whisper into his face . We both seem to hold our breath . It ’s like we ’re in some kind of strange limbo . Sexiest . Re - enactment . Of Goldilocks . Ever . His pulse drums hot and steady beneath the hard line of his jaw . I imagine pressing my lips to the tender skin there . Desire floods my veins . “
38453	38454	38455	38455	I	1493	” “
38460	38646	38455	38455	I	1493	” Something ’s melting in my belly . He drops the puff bit , his face lit with beautiful fury . He brushes some bits off the center of my chest , my shoulder . The feeling of his hand on me is electric . And then he moves to my cheek , swiping it with his thumb , rough velvet on hot silk . There might have been a crumb there . Really , I do n’t care . His chest rises and falls , seemingly in unison with mine . His expression is so serious . I remember it from that summer — it was the way he looked when he cared about getting something right . I feel this rush of frustration . I want us to be different . Free of our factions and fraught history . He slides his thumb across my lower lip . The urge to take it into my mouth is nearly unbearable . I would suck it so hard . I would reach down and touch his cock and suck the hell out of his thumb . “
38651	38687	38688	38688	You	769	” He reaches to my hair , brushes a possibly real or maybe imaginary crumb off , then slides a strand through his fingers . He watches his progress through lowered lashes . He says , “
38697	38703	38688	38688	You	769	” I swallow with difficulty . “
38707	38909	38688	38688	You	769	” Again he slides my hair through his fingers , watching intently , as though he ’s really into making sure the crumbs are gone . The lightest sheen of whisker stubble glints on his cheeks . He tucks another strand behind my ear . Then he brushes some more back . I ’m catatonic with lust . And confusion . What is Max doing ? He tucks my hair again , this time grazing the shell of my ear . The bright swipe of his touch ripples over my body . It arrows down between my legs . My breath hitches . I want him to press himself right into me and make me come . Coming like that is not a thing with me , but right now , it would be . I want him so badly , I might burst into flames . He draws his mouth close to my ear , right there where he tucked away the hair . His breath is warm velvet on my ear . I close my eyes . My entire skeletal system is turning into jelly at this point . I imagine gripping his shoulders , pulling him to me . “
38912	38916	38918	38918	your	770	” he whispers , “
38924	38930	38918	38918	your	770	” My eyes fly open . “
38935	38941	38942	38942	You	770	” I push him away . “
38949	38957	38942	38942	You	770	” He just watches me , amused . “
38965	38975	38958	38958	You	770	” He lowers his voice to a hard rumble . “
38985	38989	38958	38958	You	770	” I snort . “
38993	39064	39065	39065	Parker	161	” I grab my cart and leave , fling open the door and almost bump into Parker . I step back . Parker Westbrook , his brainiac business partner , a budding sax player back at the Shiz . Parker still has his same chubby cheeks and nerdy glasses and generally disheveled bearing — the pile of folders and magazines he ’s carrying looks like it ’s about to explode . “
39067	39085	39065	39065	Parker	161	” I say , then I remember he was another rich kid who was unkind to me . “
39088	39098	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” I add , in a more morose tone . “
39101	39109	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” He looks me up and down . “
39113	39136	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” I do a little shimmy , hips wiggling , while I circle my finger , then point it right at him . “
39143	39162	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” Just a little alpha - signaling - reverse - chasing combo courtesy of Max ’s pathetic book . “
39172	39179	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” he says , walking in . “
39183	39187	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” I say . “
39192	39198	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” he says to Max . “
39202	39290	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” Vicious campaign . I snort and look back at Max . He just smiles his cool superior smile . I get out of there and ride the elevator down . 11 Be playful and outrageous . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Max I should bar Meow Squad from the building . It ’s what I should do . A smarter man would do that . A smarter man would ’ve done it the first day . “
39300	39304	39099	39099	Mia	1866	” Parker says , “
39320	39321	39322	39322	I	1493	” “
39331	39332	39325	39325	She	1866	” “
39335	39336	39342	39342	She	1866	” “
39396	39400	39401	39401	I	1493	” I shrug . “
39424	39446	39409	39409	she	163	” Parker has this strange look on his face . He never liked her , never wanted to be around her . “
39449	39526	39409	39409	she	163	” It ’s outrageous , of course . The idea that Mia would seek me out , thinking she ’d just bring it — to me — a man who controls a billion - dollar empire , along with all of the messaging and mindshare that spreads out from that , and she ’s a lunch - cart girl , and she decides it ’s a good time to bring it … it ’s classic Mia . “
39547	39551	39540	39540	she	163	” Parker frowns . “
39558	39559	39555	39555	she	163	” “
39562	39621	39626	39626	she	163	” Parker snorts . You had to be a student at the Shiz to comprehend the cut of that word . Impressive meant style over substance . Flash over soul . It meant you were pandering to the audience as opposed to being a serious artist . Impressive suggested that you cared only about looking good to people . “
39630	39631	39626	39626	she	163	” “
39650	39651	39652	39652	You	774	” “
39658	39659	39652	39652	You	774	” “

39683	39690	39669	39669	She	163	” he says . I shrug . “
39703	39944	39669	39669	She	163	” Parker spins through the media plan . I sometimes fly Parker and some of my buddies out to Vegas to see mixed martial arts fights . Front - row seats . Ringside service . If you know the sport , you know that the fighter who is flat on his back can sometimes turn that position to his advantage . There are certain moves that can be downright deadly from the bottom . Leave it to Mia to think she ’s going to bring it from the bottom . A lunch - cart girl . But what does Mia care ? The world is her cocktail party . Back at the Shiz , wherever you heard laughter or gasps and whispers rising up from a group , you knew Mia was at the center of it . Ah , Antonio . Who the hell is he ? A Wall Street guy ? Hotshot exec ? How does she even meet somebody like that ? No , she ’s not with him — I know it . Mia ’s gaze takes on a certain softness when she ’s captured by something . And that ’s not how she looked at Antonio . I saw her face only briefly , but it was enough . Still . What was I seeing ? He looked ready to haul her over his shoulder and carry her off . Parker shows me another board . “
39952	39956	39669	39669	She	163	” he says . “
39981	39982	39978	39978	you	777	” “
39985	39989	39978	39978	you	777	” I say . “
39992	39993	39978	39978	you	777	” “
40002	40009	39978	39978	you	777	” He flips to a backdrop . “

40037	41112	41113	41113	Max	1419	” I look up at the image of me and Lana at the Maximillion fifth anniversary photo shoot that Mia keeps staring at . It ’s a shot of me sitting with my old friend Lana , bag designer extraordinaire . Lana ’s sister and one of the Max Hilton girls from that year , a jewelry designer , are gathered around us , laughing at something . Two - point - five stars . I bite back a smile . It was a good night at the top of Maximillion Plaza , all champagne fountains and A - list celebs and athletes . A whirlwind event where we raised tens of thousands of dollars for charity . And not once did I look out over the rooftops and wonder what she was doing . Not once did I sling my arm around a woman ’s shoulders and think , you ’re not her . 12 Only an idiot tells a woman what she wants to hear . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Max The Maximillion Companies studio complex sits across the street from the main headquarters . It ’s a creative workshop , a refuge from the demands of running the company . Doing a round through there is the high point of my day — I enjoy finding out about my employees ’ projects on an informal basis . Hearing what ’s on people ’s minds . I sometimes see Mia and her co - workers around the Meow Squad truck out on 8th , but she ’s not there today . Which means I may not see her today at all — I have an interview and a lunch event across town . I head in . The studio complex was an abandoned eyesore across the street when we first took over the tower . After an unexpectedly good quarter — and against the wishes of our accounting team — we bought it and had it gutted and made into an open , colorful creative space with large and small work rooms honeycombed around the edges . I love to walk around there and get the fashion designers , industrial designers , and marketing creatives to pitch me big ideas . Sometimes I pitch them . It took a long time to get them to stop treating me like an owner , or worse , a celeb . To understand that I ’m just a collaborator with extra juice . It took a few rounds of championing wild ideas and handing out bonuses even when things crashed to get them to relax around me . And Maximillion Companies is all the better for it . I check on the apparel design team , and then I ’m up in the photography studio talking about shots . The studio has windows that overlook the street below . It ’s right before eleven when I see the Meow Squad truck pull into one of the fifteen - minute spaces . Somebody is talking to me about a new series of images for the Maximillion body spray , but I ca n’t stop watching the truck , wondering what she ’ll get up to today . Eating my cheesy puffs . Letting the evidence of it sprinkle down her front . I ’m sure she was laughing as she did it . Stuffing her face and laughing . Did she deliberately place the one large puff right in front , hoping to draw my eye ? Yes , of course . Standing there trying to look serious . Mischief in her eyes ; cheesy puff crumbs in her hair . In your room full of balloons , Mia is the one holding the needle , dancing around like a dervish , laughing her head off . And the way she added all of that bling to her uniform . It reminds me of the way she dressed when she first got to the Shiz — as though a magpie dressed her , all loud colors and mismatched metallics . Later , she made herself over , or maybe her friends did . A new casually - elegant style to go with her new casually - elegant accent . A young guy jumps out and opens up the back . A redhead with Meow Squad ears walks up — hers are lit with tiny lights , oddly enough . My photographer is talking about the color process , petitioning for a Japanese photo app that automates something or other . He drones on as more Meow Squad people arrive and get their pre - packed carts . I nod , feigning interest . And then she ’s there , ears shining in the late - morning sunlight , standing straight and proud , making the most of her small frame . The stance is classic Mia . She ’d hold her head high through every setback , going after her stage career with an urgency that was n’t there with other kids . It looked like urgency , anyway ; I had this idea that it was a little bit about escape , too . We both wanted to escape in our own ways , I guess . One of the few things we had in common . I flex my fingers as she touches the young van driver on the shoulder , talking to him excitedly . Mia always had lots of funny , charming stories . I think half the school was in love with her . She pulls out her cart and arranging it just so , laughing . Something lightens in me , seeing her laugh , but then her friend Antonio appears around the corner . How does he end up out there ? Does he wait for her ? Do they text ? He ’s wearing another nice suit , actually . He ’s young to know how to wear a suit so well . I ’d think he was a model himself if not for his briefcase . She seems happy to see him , but the way she looks at him — she ’s fond of him . It ’s the way she ’d look at a pet hamster . She grabs his arm and says something , head tilted , just an air of mischief . “
41115	41116	41113	41113	Max	1419	” “
41121	41137	41113	41113	Max	1419	” I say , not wanting to tear my gaze from the scene unfolding below . “
41148	41149	41144	41144	I	1493	” “
41154	41489	41144	41144	I	1493	” She ’s twisting her lips at him . It ’s her humorous and not - so - sure - about - this look . Playful scolding . Or am I reading her wrong ? Now his hands are on her shoulders and he ’s regarding her with outsized emotions — shock , joy . I ’m reminded of a Facebook video I once saw of a deaf man who ’d gotten some kind of ear implant and could hear for the first time . He listened to the ocean with that stunned , joyful , bewildered expression . Then he listened to some symphony music with a face like that . I do n’t get why Antonio looks at Mia like that . Did she deliver some astonishing news ? But she still has that fond scolding look . She reaches up and fixes his tie . Is she whispering to him ? My blood goes cold as he slides his hand to the side of her head . He leans in and kisses her . I wait for her to push him away . Instead she shoves her hands into his hair , vigorously messing it up . Her hands grip his back . The kiss is getting dramatic . I ’m off , heading down to the lower level , my legs moving before my mind can stop me . I ’m rushing down the stairwell , out the door . My mood is dark as I emerge onto the busy thoroughfare . I need to get to them . I do n’t know why . I do n’t need a reason . Traffic is insane — I’m waiting at the light for what feels like forever . Finally it clears . The walk light flashes on and I ’m stomping across the street . Around the corner . My brow lowers as I approach the truck . They ’re both gone . There ’s just the kid . The driver . “
41495	41509	41491	41491	I	1493	” he asks . I take out my wallet and extract a fifty . “
41516	41524	41491	41491	I	1493	” The driver gapes at the money . “
41531	41532	41491	41491	I	1493	” “
41544	41545	41537	41537	you	1493	” “
41558	41559	41550	41550	I	1493	” “
41567	41590	41591	41591	He	549	” The kid looks up and down the street , as if he ’s worried Antonio might jump out of the shadows . “
41601	41605	41591	41591	He	549	” I frown . “
41611	41612	41591	41591	He	549	” “
41636	41651	41632	41632	he	549	” I get a little closer and shove the fifty into his front pocket . “
41671	41678	41679	41679	Antonio	549	” The kid lowers his voice . “
41703	41709	41700	41700	I	1493	” I stare . Hard . “
41715	41723	41700	41700	I	1493	” Solemnly , he shakes his head . “
41734	41742	41743	41743	He	549	” My protective instincts kick into overdrive . “
41750	41751	41743	41743	He	549	” “
41757	41762	41763	41764	The man	313	” the kid says . “
41835	41856	41827	41827	him	313	” He shakes his head as he loads an empty cart into the back of his truck . I frown . “
41860	41861	41827	41827	him	313	” “
41872	41873	41864	41864	I	1493	” “
41877	41896	41899	41899	she	1866	” He rushes around to the front and pulls open the door . I follow on his heels . “
41904	41905	41899	41899	she	1866	” “
41911	41912	41899	41899	she	1866	” “
41918	41922	41915	41915	you	1493	” I say . “
41944	41945	41936	41936	she	1866	” “
41949	42210	42211	42211	Max	1419	” I turn and walk toward the Hillman building . I do n’t like this . I do n’t like the boy ’s alarm . I do n’t like that they kissed . Is this man in the mafia ? Is that what the kid was getting at ? Mia would n’t have anything to do with somebody like that . I go one block , two blocks , barreling past the dawdling pedestrians , ignoring the heads that swivel around in recognition . I ’m thinking about calling a friend on the force , a detective who ’s done time on an organized crime unit , and asking him what he knows about gang members newly arrived from Rome , specifically anybody named Antonio . The Hillman tower looms ahead . I position myself to the side of the door , trying to collect my thoughts . I ca n’t be late to this luncheon , but this Antonio situation feels all wrong . I go over what I know : Roman male prostitute who graduated to knife fighting . He murdered several people . Sharp dresser . Model - good looks . And the way he looked at her , like a man in hell seeing an angel . And the way she gripped his back , the high drama . I turn the thing over in my mind . And then I just start laughing . Mia ’s out the door moments later , bumping her cart down the steps . I go up to help her . “
42218	42228	42229	42229	I	1493	” I lift the cart onto the flat sidewalk . “
42237	42241	42235	42235	Antonio	549	” I say . “
42254	42258	42259	42259	He	549	” she says . “
42264	42268	42259	42259	He	549	” I say . “
42284	42289	42273	42273	he	549	” She looks bewildered . “
42292	42293	42294	42294	Antonio	549	” “
42332	42337	42338	42339	A cop	789	” She looks pale . “
42341	42342	42343	42343	He	1915	” “
42371	42399	42403	42403	I	1493	” Confusion fills her face . I do my best not to smile , but I fail , and she sees it . She slaps my chest . “
42410	42462	42403	42403	I	1493	” I go to her , knit our fingers together , right there on the sidewalk , with streams of people moving around us and the cart . She ’s warm and breathy , a beautiful , trembling confection . What am I doing ? I need to be across town . “
42470	42478	42403	42403	I	1493	” A defiant gleam in her eyes . “
42488	42498	42499	42499	I	1493	” I lower my voice to a deep register . “
42512	42566	42499	42499	I	1493	” I can feel her shudder through our pressed - together palms . I brush my lips lightly over hers , and then I kiss her . She gasps into the kiss . She presses into me . Her pleasure is a drug — the more I get , the more I crave . “
42574	42586	42587	42587	You	1419	” she whispers into the millimeter of space between our lips . “
42595	42604	42587	42587	You	1419	” I cup her cheeks , cradling them . “
42613	42624	42587	42587	You	1419	” I swipe my thumb over her perfectly plump lips . “
42637	42712	42587	42587	You	1419	” I sip my latte , waiting for my pre - luncheon interview . Why did I kiss her like that ? What was I thinking ? I ’d vowed to stay away from her . But god , the way her eyes shone — burnt - sugar brown . Maddening , impossible Mia Corelli . A shadow falls over the table , and there he is , Tarquin Walters , intrepid tabloid reporter . “
42727	42734	42719	42719	Meow	793	” he says , sitting down . “
42741	42783	42785	42785	me	1493	” Stunned and breathless ? He watches my face a little too intently . Does he sense a story ? The last thing I want is for Mia to wind up in the tabloids with me . She ’d hate it . “
42795	42807	42785	42785	me	1493	” Tarquin gives me a jaded look and orders a coffee . “
42811	42815	42785	42785	me	1493	” he says , “
42828	42850	42820	42822	A delivery girl	613	” Tarquin ’s doing a feature on me . The goal of a feature profiler is always to get something juicy . “

43039	43043	43044	43044	God	69	” A joke . “
43048	43058	43044	43044	God	69	” he says . And then he turns serious . “
43073	43079	43082	43083	every kid	804	” I sip my coffee . “
43089	43095	43082	43083	every kid	804	” He checks his iPad . “
43116	43156	43104	43105	Annette O’Grady	171	” I stir my coffee . How did he think to connect those things ? None of the reporters at the time made the connection . The narrative was that I was trying to get out of a concert . “
43163	43167	43168	43168	Annette	171	” I say . “
43190	43234	43187	43187	she	171	” Everything , I think . The one who kissed my skinned knees and sung me lullabies . The one who brought laughter to my grim childhood . The one who took the sunshine when she died . I stare into my coffee . “
43255	43585	43247	43247	She	171	” I look up , pulse racing , relieved to see that he ’s back on his notes . We discuss my upcoming pet project , Catwalk for a Cause . I give him some red meat on that one — warring factions in the fashion world . A juicy celeb cameo . I ’ll let him announce it . We talk food . A restaurant opening we ’re attending . I tell him about the special - edition grilled whitefish sandwich from a food truck on Seventh . The chef with the Michelin rating . How did she know I ’d love the sandwich like that ? Did it give her satisfaction to be right ? She always did have excellent taste — that ’s something I remember from high school . She ’d cultivated excellent taste and her own unique opinions on everything . Little Jerseygirl , scrabbling her way up . And she always , always wanted to show you that she was in charge . 13 Show your sense of humor — you never want to take yourself too seriously , and you definitely do n’t want to take her too seriously . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia I ’m still fuming on my way to work the next day . He ’s a complete and utter jerkalope who loves to mess with me . One furious , utterly mind - blowing kiss and he thinks he owns me . Why do I keep falling for it ? Yes , it was a good kiss . Max is good at things . Ruthlessly so . He was good at making me think he cared that summer . Sienna is at the meeting spot the next day , posed next to a fire hydrant . She has pink fur on her ears and a pink feather boa . She springs up and hugs me . “

43632	43640	43629	43629	my	1493	” I say , eyeing her boots . “

43847	44006	44011	44011	Blade	140	” Sienna says . Rollins arrives with our go - sheets . I grab mine to see what Max ordered . Nothing . No order from the twenty - fifth floor . Again . My heart sinks . But it ’s for the best . I ’m supposed to be fighting for my friends , not kissing Max Hilton , king of careless trysts and liquor carts , the player responsible for Kelsey ’s misery . It ’s just that he did n’t feel like a player — not when he ’s with me , anyway . I run through my financial building delivering meals . Trying to be bright , calling everybody by their assigned names . I hit my next buildings , one by one , and then I ’m at Maximillion Plaza . The people are upbeat . It seems like a good place to work . Blade , in particular , is all smiles . “
44013	44052	44011	44011	Blade	140	” I like calling him Blade . He launches into some funny story — not from Max ’s book . But still . I give him a sideways look . Is he flirting with me ? He says , “
44068	44084	44011	44011	Blade	140	” My mind goes blank . Not only flirting ; he ’s asking me out . “
44091	44095	44011	44011	Blade	140	” he says . “

44247	44266	44241	44241	mister	824	” He pulls open his chips , which he in no way gives me a hard time about . “
44270	44271	44272	44272	I	1493	” “
44277	44298	44272	44272	I	1493	” I say . I ’d feel … weird . Even though it would be hugely effective as prize positioning . “

44322	44634	44316	44316	I	1493	” I say , and I give him a silent meow , just because that feels appropriate . 14 Never let them smell blood in the water . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Max Parker and I are hosting the Catwalk for a Cause steering committee luncheon over the noon hour . Laughing and brainstorming with some of the smartest , most fascinating people in the style and design world is something that would ’ve been a welcome break from the stress of my routine just weeks ago . But now ? I wish I could be back in my office . I hate missing lunch in my office , or more specifically , I hate missing Mia . I hate missing her smile and her frown and her smartass comments and her outrageous moves . And god , that kiss . It ’s wrong what we ’re doing , and I no longer care . The topic is music . Parker ’s at the head of the table with a lot of opinions on the subject . He loves music . Lana ’s next to me , bending over the proposed schedule that I ’ve worked out , practically on my lap , and Brazilian supermodel Zera Valsano , who hates costumes , is playfully wringing my neck over my suggestion she walk out in a whale costume , and I ’m laughing , and that ’s when Mia appears . I stiffen . What is she doing here ? There ’s usually a caterer for these things . She manages a tight smile , but I see her . She does n’t like the photo on my office wall , and she really does n’t like it being re - enacted in front of her . I stand . “
44637	44688	44689	44689	I	1493	” I say . She pushes her cart to the edge of the room , proud and aloof , with a slight air of danger . How is she here ? Parker ’s assistant usually arranges the catering on these things . Did Parker ’s assistant put in this order ? “
44719	44899	45117	45117	Cheesy	181	” This last in a tone dripping with loathing . Our gazes lock . The sparkle of anger and aliveness in her gaze hits something deep inside me . And I do n’t care . I ’m just glad she ’s here . Mia ’s beautiful even in her hatred — so fucking beautiful I can barely breathe . Zera still has her hand on my shoulder , but it ’s Mia I ’m watching , Mia ’s hand I ’m imagining . Does n’t she see she ’s the most exciting woman in the room ? My girl goes through the layout with confident movements , never giving me the satisfaction of seeing her sweat . I ’m so proud of her I could die . Needing somebody more than they need you is for suckers . That was the central lesson in the book I wrote way back when . It felt like the gospel truth back then . But right now I need for everybody to be gone from here so I can be with Mia . “
44905	44915	44916	44916	Lindsey	180	” Parker says , squeezing mayo onto his sandwich . “
44925	45003	44916	44916	Lindsey	180	” Lindsey launches into a rundown of the schedule in the exciting and slightly confidential way that she has . Mia has everybody ’s lunches set out except mine . Making me wait . She gives me a mischievous look . She ’s a lot of sunshine and a little bit devil . She sets a napkin in front of me , and then my croissant sandwich . I gaze up at her , meeting her devil . “
45008	45100	44916	44916	Lindsey	180	” I say hoarsely . Her cheeks go pink . There ’s nothing sexier than the real Mia pushing out from underneath her acting skills , like a wildflower through concrete . When she ’s really off - balance , the old accent peeks through — just the edges of it . She sets down the mustards . Energy flares between us . It ’s all so wrong , and I goddamn love it . I ’m addicted to our dance . To her . She sets down the cheesy puffs . “
45107	45116	45117	45117	Cheesy	181	” I ask . Her cheeks go pink . “
45122	45123	45117	45117	Cheesy	181	” “
45144	45153	45134	45134	I	1493	” I say . She licks her lips . “
45181	45182	45134	45134	I	1493	” “
45185	45207	45134	45134	I	1493	” I can feel Parker staring at us — probably wondering what is up . I ’m so far from caring . “
45211	45243	45134	45134	I	1493	” She opens the chips and arranges them just so , at a specific angle like she does when she ’s trying to annoy me , then she positions the mustards . “
45247	45344	45134	45134	I	1493	” I say . At least it sounds like a thank you to the people around the table . It ’s really just a tug on the rope between us . Mia spares me a burning glance . Is it possible she ’s jealous ? Does she think I arranged this ? To get a rise out of her ? She ’s doing her fussy repositioning of my sandwich , and all I want to do is kiss her . I want everyone gone and for it to be just us . I ’m going mad . “
45353	45358	45134	45134	I	1493	” she says sweetly . “
45365	45370	45371	45371	I	1493	” My breath speeds . “
45382	45383	45371	45371	I	1493	” “
45391	45399	45371	45371	I	1493	” She has everybody ’s attention now . “
45408	45409	45402	45402	I	1493	” “
45412	45501	45402	45402	I	1493	” I ask , rapt . With the economical speed of a boxer , she punches her fist down into the sandwich . The dull thump of a fist hitting a wad of meat and pastry resounds through the hush . Gasps and exclamations rise up . I stare at the sandwich in shock . She ’s smashed a crater into the middle of it . Bits of roast beef and swiss bulge out the sides of the misshapen croissant . She straightens . She smiles at me . “
45506	45581	45402	45402	I	1493	” My people watch me , aghast . The lunch - cart girl just smashed her fist into my sandwich . What will I do ? I bite back a smile . Pride is probably the wrong emotion here . Lust is definitely the wrong emotion . Everything falls away but her . She just does n’t give a fuck — she never did . Even back in high school she was like that . “
45584	45596	45597	45597	I	1493	” I say in the patrician tone that drives her insane . “
45605	45606	45607	45607	My	1493	” “
45610	45667	45607	45607	My	1493	” She smiles sweetly . Everybody turns back to me , waiting for the famous Max Hilton retort . I always have something clever to say , but right now I do n’t . There ’s just me and Mia . I just love her . I swallow . Did I really just have that thought ? “
45676	45686	45673	45674	Bon appetit	182	” She pushes her cart out . I stand . “
45695	45752	45673	45674	Bon appetit	182	” I end the sentence with a mumble and get out of there . Nothing in that room is important anymore . I head out after her , down the hall . I round a corner just as her cart disappears into the elevator . I slap my hand over the doors . Her nostrils flare . “
45767	45774	45762	45763	the models	830	” A grin splits my face . “
45784	45785	45762	45763	the models	830	” “
45788	45792	45793	45793	I	1493	” she breathes . “
45801	45816	45793	45793	I	1493	” I ’m in the elevator . I let the doors close behind me . “
45825	45826	45818	45818	you	829	” “
45829	45833	45818	45818	you	829	” she says . “
45838	45853	45818	45818	you	829	” I cage her with my arms . Pure lust courses through my veins . “
45864	45869	45818	45818	you	829	” She beams at me “
45883	45884	45818	45818	you	829	” “
45890	45908	45818	45818	you	829	” I whisper . She so loved punching my sandwich , and I love her for it . “
45920	46023	45818	45818	you	829	” 15 Never fixate on any one woman ; you ’re playing a numbers game . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia I should be angry . Max making me play lunch - cart girl in front of his models ? What is that ? But being with him in this small space is putting my hormones into overdrive . Lighting my skin like electricity . He slides his hand around the back of my neck . His fingers seem to tremble — there ’s something so raw about him now . “
46026	46108	45818	45818	you	829	” he says raggedly . My hands are sliding around the bulk of him . My hands are treating themselves to generous helpings of his cashmere suit coat , pulling him to me , rampaging across soft fabric and hard muscle He kisses me — furiously , passionately . He hauls me up to him , closer , harder . His chest is a flat plane against my breasts ; his cock at the V of my legs a delicious presence . “
46111	46140	46141	46141	Mia	1866	” I say into our kiss . I had this whole idea of not giving him the satisfaction of a reaction , but I ’m failing at that . “
46143	46276	46141	46141	Mia	1866	” he breathes , peppering hot kisses over my neck while I pant and melt some more . He ’s a spy in the night , stealing over enemy lines , going deeper , winning me over . My fingers have hit warm skin under his white shirt . And I do n’t want to stop . I want Max like there ’s no tomorrow . Like there ’s no chart on our wall that ’s a service to all womankind . He pulls away from the kiss and looks into my eyes . He looks furious and beautiful . Suddenly the elevator ’s moving . Maybe another floor called it . He lets out a shuddery breath and shoves a key into the panel and the elevator grinds to a halt . “
46282	46286	46141	46141	Mia	1866	” I ask . “
46289	46341	46141	46141	Mia	1866	” he says , twisting my hair in his fist and pressing kisses onto my neck , and then he sucks in a small tag of skin and it bites . I think I ’m going to have a hickey and I want that . I want him to mark me . “
46355	46356	46141	46141	Mia	1866	” “
46365	46399	46141	46141	Mia	1866	” I burrow my fingers under the belt of his trousers . Feverishly I pull his belt from the loops , big , dramatic motions that enhance the drama of our elevator tryst . “
46402	46454	46141	46141	Mia	1866	” He catches my greedy hands and extracts them from his person , presses them back up against the cool panel , up over my head . All in one big hand of his . With the other , he slides a knuckle over my cheekbone . What is he doing ? “
46471	46472	46463	46463	your	183	” “
46480	46490	46463	46463	your	183	” He dips his head and kisses my neck . “
46497	46498	46463	46463	your	183	” “
46512	46513	46463	46463	your	183	” “
46518	46569	46570	46570	Omigod	184	” I gasp as he slides his hand slowly down my front , passing over one electrified nipple on his way to my pussy . He shoves my apron out of the way and his whole hand is between my legs , cupping and kneading me through the warm fabric . “
46572	46576	46570	46570	Omigod	184	” I breathe , “
46579	46626	46570	46570	Omigod	184	” He ’s on the move again . He found the hidden elastic waistband of my cat suit pants and pushes his hand in . I hiss as he makes contact with my wetness . He keeps my hands pinned , like I might fly away . “
46630	46643	46570	46570	Omigod	184	” he asks , rubbing a heavy finger across my swollen nub . “
46646	46714	46570	46570	Omigod	184	” I breathe . My body hums in response to his confident strokes . Ratchets up with feeling . Everything is so surreal now , maybe I can fly . But I would n’t want to right now . I would n’t want to leave his fingers and exactly what he is doing to me . I groan as he slides a wide finger along my seam . “
46717	46721	46570	46570	Omigod	184	” he says . “
46726	46975	46976	46976	Omigod	184	” So I ’m silent , immobile , the opposite of how I usually go at sexytimes , but it ’s good . Like the pressure ’s off . It ’s just me and him . And his perfect finger . His wise , all - knowing , all - rhythm - having finger , stoking my pleasure . I do n’t want him to stop . My eyes close . I ’m in some delicious agony where Max is owning me and I ’ll probably regret it but I do n’t care . I ’m a junkie who will give up her world for what his finger is doing . He kisses me at an expert angle that feels like heaven , nipping my lip . I ’m panting out words that do n’t make a lot of sense unless you understand that every word I ’m saying right now means more , which Max seems to fully understand at the moment . Because he gets me like that . My orgasm sneaks up on me , sudden and unexpected , swelling through my body , my mind . My head lolls against the elevator panel . He does n’t have my hands pinned any more . When did that happen ? He ’s pushing a lock of hair out of my eyes , watching me come down . Like he ’s absorbing my pleasure . It ’s the opposite of everything that ’s classic Max Hilton . “
46978	46988	46989	46989	Mia	1866	” I say . He smiles his knowing smile . “
46991	46992	46993	46993	I	1493	” “
47000	47004	46993	46993	I	1493	” I say . “
47010	47014	46993	46993	I	1493	” he says . “
47030	47075	46993	46993	I	1493	” My heart pounds . I want it to be true so bad , but I ’m scared . Max has made a cottage industry out of lulling me into a false sense of security and then yanking the rug out from under me . “
47081	47209	46993	46993	I	1493	” he rasps . To the reality of us — that he got Meow Squad assigned to his building and requested me as delivery person with an agenda in mind . That he ’s too good for me . I try to tell myself that it ’s maybe just fear , but then I look up at the elevator chandelier . Something about it is so familiar . What ? Then I remember it — the Instagram post . A woman against this very wall . A man ’s hand planted on the panel next to her . That chandelier in the reflective area above her . The caption : This elevator has everything it needs except a well - stocked liquor cart . I feel sick . “
47223	47229	47234	47234	Max	266	” I push him away . “
47236	47237	47234	47234	Max	266	” “
47240	47244	47234	47234	Max	266	” he asks . “
47260	47261	47234	47234	Max	266	” “
47267	47299	47234	47234	Max	266	” I hit the buttons . They make a little plastic nothing sound . Ineffectual buttons disconnected from the world . Like Max ’s heart . I point to the key . “
47304	47305	47234	47234	Max	266	” “
47310	47311	47234	47234	Max	266	” “
47316	47320	47234	47234	Max	266	” I snap . “
47326	47367	47234	47234	Max	266	” Pain flashes across his face . Or maybe I just imagine it . He turns the key and the elevator is moving . I move away from him . He says my name and I put up my hand . “
47376	47506	47234	47234	Max	266	” The door opens on the lobby floor to a group of chattering professionals who part as I push my cart away . The doors shut . I stand alone in front of the blank elevator doors , panting . He brought me into his building to wait on him . Now he ’s seducing me . This is a victory lap , nothing more , nothing less . If Max was actually interested in me , he ’d ask for a date , not make me his servant . The more I think about it , the angrier I get . I hit the elevator again and pop back up to the twentieth floor . I leave my cart in the hall and burst into Blade ’s office . “
47519	47524	47234	47234	Max	266	” He looks surprised . “
47532	47533	47534	47534	You	837	” “
47539	47540	47534	47534	You	837	” “
47544	47625	47628	47628	Blade	140	” he says . You ’re sweet , I think before I can stop myself . And then I add , You ’re sexy . I do n’t hugely think it , but maybe I could think it . I remind myself of all of the TV shows that I currently love but that I was n’t so sold on during the first few episodes . Maybe Blade ’s like that . Maybe he ’ll unwarp my mind from Max . “
47634	47635	47628	47628	Blade	140	” “
47643	48369	47636	47636	I	1493	” he says . My mouth is smiling , but my mind is saying , please , for the love of all that ’s holy , do n’t say deets again . 16 Never ask a woman if you can kiss her . She should be asking you . Better yet , she should begging you . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Max People start streaming into the four - story atrium , everybody in their finest . Oscars - night shit . I shake hands and exchange New Year ’s wishes . I ’m not a fan of New Year ’s Eve , but I ’m proud that the Maximillion holiday ball is such a hot ticket , all tuxedos and cocktail - length gowns . Never underestimate the draw of a dress - up party with a large Instagram component . I fix my bowtie . Parker ’s sitting on the edge of the stage , holding court with a glittering group . I catch his eye and salute him . He smiles huge and salutes me back . You could n’t want a better business partner . The professional scavenger - hunt designers — yes , there is such a thing — come over to consult with me about some last - minute decisions . They ’ve been hiding prizes and clues in the blocks between the park and Midtown . You have to take selfies with the clues when you find them . They ’ve done an amazing job . The party is also beloved by my employees , thanks in part to the massive loot that ’s involved . The socialites and industry people tend to play for charity . The PR and social media buzz we get off it is worth ten times what we spend on the thing . My heart is not in it . All I can think about is Mia . Mia punching my sandwich like an outrageous goddess . The way she felt in the elevator , soft and hot in my arms . Mia ’s face at the end . What happened ? Maybe I should ’ve followed her , but I ’m not in the habit of following women who say leave me as energetically as Mia did . I tracked down her number and texted her a few times , and she promptly blocked me . I got her address , and I gave serious thought to sending something nice , or even going over there . I 'm going to figure it out after this party . I ’m going to make her see that she ’s not notch in my elevator bar . I ’ve never felt such an intense connection with a woman — not even close , except maybe that summer with Mia . I screwed it up . I wo n’t do it again . I grab a champagne off a passing tray . The string quartet plays a festive arrangement with its roots in folk songs — the key changes feel Slavic . Russian , maybe . They ’ve got an excellent fiddler — somebody actually trained . Enough that I have to wander near to get a look . I stop short when I recognize the lead violinist from the Shiz — DJ Barnes . I ’m not loving that DJ Barnes is here . A lot of the people from high school are jobbers now , sitting in on musical groups and bands and orchestras . It ’s inevitable that I run into them at events . Still . High school was a miserable time , and I do n’t like seeing people from then . Except Parker . And Mia , of course . DJ looks over and smiles . I give him a friendly nod . They start up something new — a demanding number designed to pluck annoyingly at the heartstrings , and they ’re putting their all into it . Hearing him play his heart out , it sends a feeling through me that ’s not exactly pleasant . As if on cue , Tarquin Walters is by my side with his photographer . Still working that profile . He ’s the last person I want to see . “
48375	48384	48370	48370	I	1493	” I raise my glass with a smile . “
48391	48403	48370	48370	I	1493	” He gives me a look I ca n’t quite read . “
48410	48416	48370	48370	I	1493	” I frown , stiffen . “
48419	48420	48370	48370	I	1493	” “
48433	48434	48426	48426	They	840	” “
48444	48448	48435	48435	I	1493	” I shrug . “
48464	48465	48458	48458	You	839	” “
48478	48715	48472	48472	I	1493	” Of course he will . All the better to ruin my party for me . Not that it is n’t ruined already , because I ca n’t stop thinking about Mia . Lana comes up and links arms with Tarquin . I give her a grateful look . My attention drifts back to the quartet . In your dreams , she said . Except she was right there with me before that . My blood races . She thinks I ’m toying with her ? It seems clear she does n’t trust me , maybe does n’t trust my motives . Why ? Is it from high school ? Is it the Max Hilton thing ? Tarquin ’s addressing me now . He ’s broken away from Lana , who shrugs helplessly behind him . I give him a charming smile . An in - on - the - joke smile . People want a lot of things from me . Tarquin wants his angle , yes , but he also wants to feel like part of the in - crowd . One of the beautiful people . I have created this empire by knowing what people want . Specifically what men want . A new song . A musical arrangement that ’s new to my ears . I feel his eyes on me as I zero in on the contrapuntal voice of the bass . “
48718	48719	48472	48472	I	1493	” “
48725	48726	48727	48727	Planners	841	” “
48729	48730	48731	48731	They	841	” “
48738	48744	48735	48736	This quartet	841	” I cock my head . “
48754	48755	48757	48757	you	843	” “
48784	48809	48778	48778	you	843	” I lean in to him as if I ’m about to share a confidence , to give him a piece of Max Hilton . “
48819	48820	48811	48811	you	843	” “
48823	48827	48811	48811	you	843	” he says . “
48832	48846	48811	48811	you	843	” I dip my head closer to his , deepening my confiding tone . “
48864	48880	48860	48860	they	845	” He snorts . I smile . I slap his back . We clink glasses . “
48890	49092	48888	48888	Shirley	189	” I add . He laughs at the ridiculous reference . I take another glass . I have him back under control . We talk movies and he takes notes on that . People stream in , peacock colors across my periphery . My attention drifts to the east doorway and everything in me goes hot . I blink , unsure whether I ’m seeing right . But I ’d know that posture anywhere . It ’s Mia in a sky - blue gown that hugs her curves and sets off her dark hair . She stands out from the crowd , so self - assured and heart - stoppingly beautiful . Something in me surges to attention . What is she doing here ? The crowd shifts and I see him there on her arm , Ryan , I think his name is . From marketing . She ’s with Ryan ? She waves to somebody . She turns to say something to Ryan and he laughs . She ’s animated . Relaxed . You ca n’t be with him , I think wildly . Tarquin is saying something about Airplane Two . Family anecdote . I tune back in . “
49095	49113	49114	49114	I	1493	” I say , and from his face , I see that was n’t the right answer . “
49120	49121	49114	49114	I	1493	” “
49124	49183	49114	49114	I	1493	” he says . I swallow and look back at her . People are coming up to her , but Ryan keeps ahold of her . I want to storm over there and pull her away from him . I want to wrap her up in my coat and take her home and kiss every inch of her . “
49188	49192	49114	49114	I	1493	” Tarquin asks . “
49195	49205	49114	49114	I	1493	” He gives me a strange look and nods . “
49214	49215	49114	49114	I	1493	” “
49220	49226	49227	49227	I	1493	” I furrow my brow , “
49258	49334	49249	49249	They	1871	” I drain my drink , hand it off , pull out my phone , and start trashing emails , as if clearing my Gmail deck might magically translate to clearing the snarl from my mind , which , for the record , it does n’t . What does Ryan think he ’s doing , bringing her ? Why would she come with him ? I look back over . They ’re laughing together again . “
49343	49354	49335	49335	You	853	” Tarquin says . A statement , not a question . “
49361	49367	49335	49335	You	853	” Unease twists through me . “
49386	49429	49378	49378	He	855	” I say , wishing he ’d leave it already . I hate that she ’s here with him . Parker comes up and points out my jacket to Tarquin . Tarquin feigns interest , but he ’s sensing red meat elsewhere . “
49435	49442	49432	49432	her	856	” Tarquin asks . I frown . “
49449	49464	49466	49466	she	856	” Parker gives me a strange look . Tarquin ’s not letting it go . “
49474	49475	49466	49466	she	856	” “
49478	49486	49466	49466	she	856	” Parker says , reading my mood . “
49512	49624	49508	49510	Max Hilton girls	266	” Parker drags us over to Britta and Tabitha , two of the nerdiest models you ’ll ever meet . I encourage Tabitha to show him images of her stamp collection . That will trap him for at least twenty minutes . I watch Mia out of the corner of my eye as she moves around the edge of the place like the fucking queen of England , with Ryan gazing at her like a besotted serf , utterly outclassed . A grim smile tugs at my lips . He probably thought he was getting a bit of bling on his arm only to have her outshine him like the sun . “
49628	49781	49508	49510	Max Hilton girls	266	” I say , extricating myself from the three of them . I wander toward Mia , greeting all the people who want something from me — favors , promotion , proximity . Usually I try to talk up this year ’s charities , trying to goose the donations . I force myself to do it now . I draw near enough to her for her voice to burn . I ’m agitated , flustered , hurt , angry . I catch shards of the accent she buried like a violet in a snowstorm . I ’m shaking hands , talking with people , her laughter invading my awareness . Finally I reach them . Her gaze skitters over my tux before quickly snapping back to my face . I smile and take her hand , a quick touch , quickly ended , except for the heat that sizzles over my skin . “
49788	49792	49793	49793	I	1493	” I say . “
49806	49822	49823	49827	The lunch - cart girl	613	” Ryan laughs , gazing at her like a puppy . I turn to him . “
49829	49844	49845	49845	Mia	1866	” I say . He ca n’t seem to tear his eyes from her . “
49852	49853	49850	49850	Mia	1866	” “
49863	49867	49860	49860	he	861	” Mia says . “
49884	49885	49881	49882	The Shiz	1475	” “
49889	49897	49881	49882	The Shiz	1475	” I say , holding her gaze . “
49906	49912	49881	49882	The Shiz	1475	” Ryan says to me . “
49915	49965	49881	49882	The Shiz	1475	” I say coolly . Ryan looks amazed . I do n’t publicize it , but it ’s on Wikipedia . Did he not look at my entry ? I make a mental note to check with his supervisor about his fitness for whatever role he plays in marketing . “
49980	49981	49982	49982	He	1419	” “
49992	49996	49982	49982	He	1419	” Mia says . “
50001	50002	49997	49997	You	1419	” “
50005	50032	49997	49997	You	1419	” I say , wondering how many times tonight I ’m going to have to have a conversation about the Shiz . I turn to Mia . “
50045	50069	50033	50033	You	1419	” She puts a hand on Ryan ’s shoulder and goes up on her tiptoes , craning her neck to see the band . “
50075	50076	50072	50073	DJ Barnes	188	” “
50083	50087	50072	50073	DJ Barnes	188	” I say . “
50092	50109	50110	50110	Max	1419	” Ryan still ca n’t get past that one . Mia ’s shining eyes meet mine . “
50123	50142	50115	50115	He	1419	” There it is . I turn to her , my gaze every bit as bright as hers . “
50155	50189	50115	50115	He	1419	” She stares daggers at me . My blood runs thick with lust , and there ’s a strange energy in my chest . Everything feels too bright . The room feels hot . “
50195	50206	50191	50191	you	1419	” Ryan inquires from somewhere out on the nowhere fringes . “
50209	50220	50221	50221	Blade	140	” she says , and then she turns to him . “
50229	50230	50221	50221	Blade	140	” “
50233	50246	50221	50221	Blade	140	” It ’s out of my mouth before I can stop it . “
50256	50262	50263	50263	Blade	140	” She grabs his arm . “
50265	50345	50263	50263	Blade	140	” she says it kind of badass , like they have a dirty inside joke . What ? She calls him Blade ? Why would a woman call a man Blade ? Why would a woman call this man Blade ? It ’s like calling a Chihuahua Killer or something . But he seems to be in on it . Does he carry a blade ? Is he thuggish in bed ? An unpleasant heat prickles over my skin . “
50348	50353	50354	50354	We	866	” I bite out . “
50361	50365	50357	50359	Blade Runner fans	867	” he explains . “
50368	50383	50386	50386	he	868	” I say , still not liking it . She glares back at me . “
50402	50408	50386	50386	he	868	” She turns to him . “
50425	50426	50386	50386	he	868	” “
50433	50439	50440	50440	I	1493	” Ryan says to her . “
50456	50457	50452	50452	people	1466	” “
50466	50470	50452	50452	people	1466	” she says . “
50481	50482	50452	50452	people	1466	” “
50491	50517	50452	50452	people	1466	” he says . I gaze over at her and she itches her nose with her middle finger . FU . Everything in me swells . “
50522	50526	50452	50452	people	1466	” Ryan says . “
50531	50537	50452	50452	people	1466	” He motions between them . “
50547	50548	50452	50452	people	1466	” “
50553	50557	50452	50452	people	1466	” I say . “
50569	50570	50558	50558	You	869	” “
50579	50589	50590	50590	He	1419	” Mia says , giving me a challenging stare . “
50613	50614	50601	50601	I	1493	” “
50623	50668	50617	50617	I	1493	” I tease . She sets her jaw and straightens up , a posture I came to understand , over long hours of watching her , as her strong - against - the - world posture . The stance she takes when she means business “
50675	50676	50677	50677	They	874	” “
50683	50689	50677	50677	They	874	” I lower my voice . “
50694	50700	50701	50701	I	1493	” Her cheeks go pink . “
50711	50715	50701	50701	I	1493	” Ryan says . “
50724	50738	50739	50739	I	1493	” I say to Ryan , though I ’m still looking at Mia . “
50751	50752	50744	50744	I	1493	” “
50766	50773	50744	50744	I	1493	” Ryan says . Mia sniffs . “
50806	50956	51927	51927	her	875	” I want to drag her off . I want to kiss that smart mouth and peel off that gown and worship every sassy inch of her . Never have I felt such absolute , primal desire for a woman . My gut twists with the force of it . And then my phone buzzes . Again and again . It ’s here I realize the band ’s stopped . When did it stop ? Parker would be the one buzzing . I have a speech to make , but I ’m feeling crazy . Mia ca n’t be with Ryan . I look over at Ryan , who gives me a faltering smile , and I smile back . This is n’t about him and I ca n’t blame him for wanting her . Just do n’t fucking touch her again , I think like a man possessed . “
50960	51193	51927	51927	her	875	” I head up toward the stage on autopilot , doing the Max Hilton walk , cool as a cucumber in my designer tux . I grab a glass of champagne from an assistant and climb the three steps , sauntering over to the podium like I own the place , which I do . I smile , holding my glass in two careless fingers , trying to find her in the crowd , but the lights are dimming . I gaze out at the crowd , like , what the hell are you all still talking for ? Some people laugh . More look up at me . Eventually everyone ’s with me without my saying a word . Because people want to be with me . I ’m the playboy with a glass in his hand and a sparkle in his eyes , the man who makes them feel like they ’re part of the glamorous , carefree , lux life that exists in the lifestyle ads we pump out like useless dreams . I start the speech , forcing my mind to timing , delivery . I feel the lift of the audience coalescing around me . Performing arts high school was n’t a total waste . Parker comes up and we give each other shit like we do every year , and then we talk about the charity . “
51201	51205	51927	51927	her	875	” I say . “
51227	51659	51927	51927	her	875	” Parker gives me perfectly scripted shit about that . I loop an arm around him and we clink glasses and wish each other a happy new year . I thank the caterers and the band . Fifteen minutes to hunt time . I remind people of the rules . The quartet strikes back up . Parker hops down . I move to the edge of the stage and hand the mic back to the audio guy . I ask him a question about the acoustics of the place , knowing he ’ll spin on it for a bit . She ’s brilliant in that blue . Did she wear it for him ? I bristle as he touches her arm . Blade . Does he think he ’s a tenth of a match for her ? I watch her circulate . She seemed to have close personal relationships with every last one of my employees . Mia , beloved by everybody , just like old times . Lana ’s up with the scavenger - hunt crew , comparing clipboards . They have directions for me to read off clipboards after people drink some more . This is a group that loves clipboards . The music stops just then . I look up , confused . I ’m not ready to kick off the hunt , but I see the problem . Mia . The inevitable reunion with DJ Barnes . Tearful hugs . I should n’t watch , but I ca n’t look away . They ’re arguing , or more , bantering . Mia is turning back and forth between Ryan and DJ . She ’s lit up with energy . It ’s a form of her I remember , laughing and arguing . Mia pokes a finger into DJ ’s chest . The oboist is shoving a microphone at her . Shivers cascade over my body . They ’re asking her to do a song . No , I think . I stand , immobile . Parker ’s back , talking . Parker ’s saying my name , somewhere at the fringes of my awareness . She ’s going to sing . Something , something wrong , Max ? Parker again . I can see plainly where DJ places his fingers on the fiddle . He scrapes out the first strains . Many a New Day . That ’s what she ’s going to sing . One of her Oklahoma ! solos . Not in front of all these people , I think . Because it ’s ours . “
51664	51904	51905	51905	My	1493	” Parker asks . Wrong . Wrong does n’t come close . I need a bigger word , the kind of word that the Germans might invent . A word that means that you ’re dreading something that will be painful , but you also very much want that thing to happen . And that painful thing you dread and want would involve longing for moments you can never have again . And it would involve a bursting , shouting feeling inside your chest , and all the while , your teeth are clenched . Dreadshockjoy or something . She takes a breath , and I breathe , too , because that ’s what Mia Corelli does , she reaches into your chest and pulls your breath out . Mia Corelli , always longing for more . Fighting for more . All brave and beautiful and tragic , but yet always somehow out of reach . Like a not - quite - remembered dream that floats away as soon as you grab for it , laughing as it goes . Back in your life to bring it . She starts in , high and strong and full of emotion . Voice clear like a bell . My dreadshockjoy swells . She ’s really doing it . She looks across the room at me , eyes colliding with mine , show tune like a cannonball . Parker ’s still there . “
51908	51912	51905	51905	My	1493	” he says . “
51915	51919	51905	51905	My	1493	” I say . “
51949	51955	51956	51956	You	875	” I turn to him . “
51962	51972	51960	51960	Mia	1866	” He holds up his hands in mock defense . “
51994	51995	51984	51984	You	875	” “
52022	52023	52020	52020	me	1493	” “
52026	52030	52020	52020	me	1493	” he stammers . “
52034	52173	52020	52020	me	1493	” Everything I understood about the situation reshuffles in my mind . I thought she ’d somehow engineered it . And she thinks I arranged it … in order to what ? Taunt her and boss her around ? Punch down and seduce her ? Of course that ’s what she ’d think . Why not ? God , what a dick move . And of course it ’s what she thinks . The song ’s over . She ’s smiling . She looks at Ryan . He smiles at her . People will start setting off with their clues . No , I think . You ca n’t have her . My feet take me back to the scavenger - hunt people . I tell them I ’m changing it up . We ’ll make it random . “
52184	52189	52190	52191	Random partners	879	” the guy asks . “
52198	52234	52190	52191	Random partners	879	” I say , on full Max Hilton arrogance mode . I take an iPad . I redo the numbers , putting Mia and me together . It shuffles all the rest of the partnerships . “
52247	52296	52298	52298	they	878	” They send out a new list based on my idea . 17 You have high standards . Let her know that it ’s up to her to meet those standards . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia “
52305	52314	52315	52315	I	1493	” Ryan says , frowning at the app . “
52324	52331	52315	52315	I	1493	” I blink at the list . “
52335	52336	52337	52337	I	1493	” “
52358	52510	52337	52337	I	1493	” Ryan says . Heart still thundering in my chest , I gaze across the room at Max , cold and beautiful and perfect in his tux . Community building . Riiiight . Seriously , Max should ’ve been a spy . He ’d be an amazing spy . He changed the entire course of the party and created a disinformation campaign in one fell swoop , just to ruin my date . I should be annoyed . My face is annoyed , but inside there ’s this spark of forbidden excitement . And really , I should n’t have sung the song . I told myself I wanted to get some control back , but it was a lie . I wanted some connection . To rip down his façade and get through to the cotton - candy - musical Max that I fell for . It ’s crazy behavior . “
52515	52522	52511	52511	I	1493	” I say . Ryan smiles . “
52527	52596	52511	52511	I	1493	” Partygoers in their glamorous garb are heading out to take selfies . People have brought awesome coats , because some of this takes place outside . That ’s how you collect the clues , you do a selfie with your partner with an Instagram tag . There ’s even a special glam black - and - white filter for the party that nobody else gets to use . “
52610	52615	52600	52600	women	329	” Ryan says unhelpfully . “
52643	52647	52648	52648	You	883	” Ryan smiles . “
52653	52725	52648	52648	You	883	” Ryan ’s partner comes up . She ’s a perky redhead , an intern who is super pumped about the game . She reads their first clue off her phone and tells him her theory . Everybody ’s clues are different because this is a scavenger hunt created exclusively for this party . Max probably flew in a team of turtleneck - and - monocle - wearing Viennese game designers . “
52730	52737	52726	52726	We	886	” she says . I smile . “
52741	52742	52726	52726	We	886	” “
52745	52813	52726	52726	We	886	” Ryan says . The intern is n’t listening ; she ’s staring at Max , strolling toward us , a tiger in a tux , New York ’s most eligible Prince Charming . I ’m angry , but there ’s something else — this warm buzz of familiarity as he nears . People head away , leaving us standing there , an island in the ballroom . “
52816	52820	52821	52821	I	1493	” Max says . “
52844	52845	52846	52846	You	889	” “
52866	52886	52887	52887	I	1493	” I raise my brows . A yes . He tips his head near mine . Lowers his voice . “
52898	52905	52887	52887	I	1493	” Butterflies swirl in my belly . “
52916	52921	52887	52887	I	1493	” He comes nearer . “
52942	52943	52887	52887	I	1493	” “
52950	52963	52887	52887	I	1493	” People are coming up . Max is a magnet for people . “
52971	52980	52982	52982	me	1493	” he says . I narrow my eyes . “
52984	53074	53075	53075	We	891	” His tone is serious , like this is really something . I grab my coat and we head to the elevator . His touch on the small of my back seems to radiate across my body . We wait with a crowd of rowdy partygoers and get in . People are talking to him , jokingly trying to get him to give clues . A few of them have bottles of champagne , and the mood is jolly . He says that he did n’t create the game . “
53082	53194	53075	53075	We	891	” he insists . It ’s not the elevator he got me off in , but it ’s the same décor . I give him the side eye , but he not joking around . Eventually we all spill out onto the sidewalk in front of Maximillion Plaza . It ’s a magical night ; snow falls in thick , lazy flakes , dramatic as a snow globe , frosting the dirty horizontal surfaces in sparkling white . The air is warm - ish , almost balmy , and the traffic sounds are subdued . Max shakes a few hands and poses for a few selfies and then people rush off . “
53207	53242	53198	53198	we	891	” Max looks up and down the street . More people are shouting to him . Waving . He waves . The partygoers want a piece of him , or at least a selfie . “
53251	53256	53243	53243	I	1493	” Somebody else waves . “
53260	53377	53243	53243	I	1493	” He takes my hand . We cross at a lull in the traffic and duck around the side of the Maximillion studio building — the one that used to be some kind of industrial building , the one he visits every day . He punches in a code and pulls open a door . In we walk . The door shuts , sealing us away from the din of Manhattan on New Year ’s Eve . It ’s spacious inside , with just the lights of the city pouring in through the high arched windows , making glowing squares on the wood floors . He locks the door and fixes me with a serious look . “
53383	53397	53398	53398	Max	1419	” More laughter sounds from out there . Somebody knocks at the door . “
53400	53401	53402	53402	Christ	203	” “
53404	53408	53402	53402	Christ	203	” he says . “
53416	53445	53409	53409	Your	1419	” I whisper . He scowls . There ’s something achingly real about him . He feels genuine ; raw , even . No liquor carts in sight . “
53449	53464	53409	53409	Your	1419	” He leads me across a giant expanse of moonlit floor past hushed workspaces . “
53474	53479	53409	53409	Your	1419	” I say nervously . “
53488	53489	53490	53490	I	1493	” “
53497	53546	53490	53490	I	1493	” We end up in an interior space lit by skylights from above . A lounge for workers , maybe . He sets me down on a chair and bends over me , hands on the armrests . His brows are furrowed , eyes without the ironic twinkle . “
53579	53580	53573	53573	I	1493	” “
53585	53586	53573	53573	I	1493	” “
53610	53611	53612	53612	Parker	1419	” “
53614	53618	53619	53619	I	1493	” I say . “
53622	53623	53624	53624	He	1419	” “
53650	53651	53652	53652	I	1493	” “
53658	53659	53660	53660	Mia	1866	” “
53662	53705	53660	53660	Mia	1866	” One word . My name . Mia . The low rumble of it pulls at something inside me . And I ’m so acutely aware of us alone in this space , and of the dominating way he looms above me . “
53715	53723	53708	53708	I	1493	” he says with a half smile . “
53777	53778	53779	53779	You	893	” “
53798	53807	53785	53785	I	1493	” He kneels in front of my chair . “
53816	53912	53814	53814	Mia	1866	” He ’s saying some more words , but his head is in the zone of my lap , now , and it ’s hard to concentrate . I imagine my lap lined with lights , like an airport runway , highlighting the forward route his face needs to travel in order to land in the safety and comfort of my pussy . My breath quickens . He ’s talking more . Something about the sandwiches . But then he pauses . His grip on the chair arms changes as his eyes skate over me . “
53932	53939	53921	53921	I	1493	” High school , he means . “
53947	53951	53921	53921	I	1493	” I say . “
53956	53976	53978	53978	we	899	” My hormones are little luggage trucks , driving in furious circles , beep - beep - beeping excitedly . “
53986	54003	54004	54004	I	1493	” His eyes go dark , and I ’m stunned anew by how beautiful he is . “
54013	54065	54004	54004	I	1493	” he growls . I have this sense that it ’s not me he ’s growling at — it ’s more like he ’s growling at the part of himself that wants to fuck . The really primal and base animal part that might grab my hair like a motherfucking lion . “
54069	54073	54076	54076	Mia	1866	” I whisper . “
54078	54170	54076	54076	Mia	1866	” Again his eyes rake up and down me , and suddenly his hands are heavy on my thighs , all harsh gravity through the delicate silk of my dress . I exhale a breath I did n’t know I was holding . My sex heats , a glowing landing beacon , and I settle my hands onto his , slipping my fingers suggestively under his shirt cuffs . I meet his feral gaze with a sassy little smile . Right then , it ’s as if the floodgates let loose . “
54175	54271	54173	54173	Mia	1866	” He ’s pushing his hands up my legs , taking the silky fabric of my dress with it , motions getting more frantic the more stocking he uncovers . He gathers my skirt in his fists , shoving it up over my knees . I lift my butt , giving him an assist . He shudders out a breath when he finds bare skin over thigh - high stockings . He kisses the inside of my thigh , then he rubs his whiskers there , hungry , wildly , as if to mark me . “
54276	54457	54173	54173	Mia	1866	” I pant . He presses a thumb to my core , wet through silky undergarments , and moves it , slides it , stoking waves of pleasure while he attacks my other thigh with his hungry face . It ’s silk and sandpaper . My breath catches . My toes curl . He rumbles against my tender skin . I squirm , whimpering with need . I shove my hands into his hair . Air traffic control to Max ! And just like magic , he ’s shoving my legs apart and kissing my pussy , the hot tenor of his breath against the silk that covers my clit . I hold his hair , holding on , loving him there . He kisses me again . I ’m diffuse with pleasure . My clit stands at attention , a tendril of need . The blunt pressure of his lips drives me nearly over the edge . Then his tongue is gone . He scrapes his teeth gently over my core . I cry out , meeting his gaze . “
54462	54466	54459	54459	you	902	” he growls . “
54473	54485	54468	54468	you	902	” My mind races with the logistics of the strapless bodysuit . “
54488	54525	54468	54468	you	902	” He ’s pulling at the fabric , shoving his fingers clear through the lacy part above the crotch , and then he just rips it down . Cool air invades my hot , wet pussy . “
54532	54541	54468	54468	you	902	” I gasp . He ’s not done . “
54549	54579	54580	54580	Ohmigod	204	” He pushes my legs wide over the chair arms . I ’m about to protest , except his tongue is there , warm and thick against my core . “
54582	54738	54580	54580	Ohmigod	204	” He licks up once , again . My breath comes fast . I ’m so exposed to him , it ’s madness , and the sexiest thing ever . He grips my thighs , holding me apart as he licks me . He ’s holding me in place as though he has me right where he wants me and he wo n’t be letting me go . He ’s my roller - coaster and my seatbelt . Mercilessly he licks me until I ’m at the point of no return , the tippy - top of the arc , suspended before the freefall . He draws his tongue roughly along my clit one more time . Pleasure explodes over my brain , bright behind my eyes . I ’m weightless . I ’m crying out . Max ’s rumble is a merciless vibration between my legs . I tighten my grip on his hair . “
54741	54815	54580	54580	Ohmigod	204	” He ’s already there , following my cadence like the musician he once was . Suddenly I ’m laughing . It ’s the release of pressure , and how crazy good that was , and how fast I came , and a little bit the sounds I made . He kisses my belly through the part of the bodysuit he did n’t rip , and then gazes up at me in wonder . “
54820	54849	54850	54850	You	903	” I say . Slowly he presses a finger into me . My body shudders around him . He does n’t reply ; he simply adds a finger . “
54852	54856	54857	54857	You	903	” I say . “
54861	54903	54859	54859	Max	1419	” There ’s something shattered about his gaze . He kisses the inside of my thigh , and then the other side for symmetry . And then he stands over me , leaving me with my legs over either chair arm . “
54908	54921	54922	54922	I	1493	” he rumbles , undoing his bow tie in the dim light . “
54941	54942	54947	54947	you	903	” “
54954	54955	54947	54947	you	903	” “
54969	54984	54959	54959	I	1493	” He whips off his bow tie and then he ’s undoing his buttons . “
54995	55017	54959	54959	I	1493	” He rips the rest of his shirt open , not bothering with the buttons , then skips to his pants . “
55023	55084	54959	54959	I	1493	” A wicked light shines in his eyes as he yanks off his belt . His pants are off and his cock juts upward , so thick and hard , it ’s nearly against his belly . I ’ve never seen his cock , but somehow , it ’s so him . He has a condom , tearing it open . “
55091	55102	54959	54959	I	1493	” I undo my sex - ready position and stand . “
55105	55111	54959	54959	I	1493	” I go to him . “
55115	55144	54959	54959	I	1493	” I want to be in on this with him . I kneel in front of him , wrapping my hand around him , marveling at his cock . “
55153	55154	55155	55155	I	1493	” “
55162	55166	55155	55155	I	1493	” I whisper , “
55175	55183	55168	55168	you	1493	” I kiss him and he groans . “
55190	55201	55202	55202	Mia	1866	” I trail the side of him with my fingers . “
55204	55208	55209	55209	I	1493	” he gasps . “
55216	55274	55275	55275	Mia	1866	” No , he ’s something better . He ’s undiscovered territory , wild and exotic , yet achingly familiar . So perfectly him . I lick the underside , and it jumps . I do it again , reveling in the salty , musky maleness of him , and then I press my cheek to it . “
55277	55394	55395	55395	You	904	” His voice sounds strained . I put him in my mouth , feeling the whole shape of him with my tongue and lips . I wrap my hand around his thick root and explore him . I do n’t want to stop . With other guys , I try to stage manage . Maybe set the scene with flower petals and candles . Or juice things up with breathless oohs and aahs , but Max and I are beyond that . We ’ve been through a war together . I pull him from my mouth and kiss just his tip . Suddenly he ’s out of my hand . He kneels in front of me . “
55400	55404	55405	55405	You	904	” he whispers . “
55410	55414	55415	55415	You	904	” I whisper . “
55420	55485	55486	55486	You	904	” he says , watching my eyes . A condom wrapper crinkles at the edge of my awareness . My heart pounds . We ’re kneeling face - to - face in this empty studio space in the middle of the city , me and my enemy who I know like the back of my hand , and all the walls are coming down . “
55491	55514	55486	55486	You	904	” I finally say . The light flooding in the windows is a faint dot of white in each of his eyes . “
55519	55560	55561	55561	Mia	1866	” he says . I kiss him . I press into him because I want my chest against his , because my heart feels raw , like there ’s a hole there that can only be plugged by his chest . “
55563	55610	55561	55561	Mia	1866	” he rumbles into the kiss . He stands , pulling me up with him , never once breaking the kiss . I fling my legs around him and kiss him . He holds me aloft , kneading my partly - silk - clad butt cheeks . “
55620	55621	55611	55611	You	1866	” “
55627	55665	55611	55611	You	1866	” He whirls me around and we cross some expanse of floor — three feet or thirty feet , I have no idea . He sets me on some sort of surface . My head lolls back . “
55670	55698	55611	55611	You	1866	” he rumbles . I look at him as he puts himself at my entrance , sliding his condom - clad cock around , picking up juice . “
55717	55718	55707	55707	you	1866	” “
55721	55735	55736	55736	God	69	” I beg . He pushes a little ways in , stretching me . “
55743	55818	55736	55736	God	69	” I grab handfuls of his shirt , holding him , rocking with him . His gaze falls to my lips . He leans in , nips my lower lip , just softly . I suck in a shaky little breath , trying to be quiet about it . I do n’t want him to know how he shatters me . How much power he has over me . How much I want this . “
55826	55830	55819	55819	I	1493	” he says . “
55837	55841	55834	55834	I	1493	” I joke . “
55849	55850	55834	55834	I	1493	” “
55868	55869	55859	55859	you	906	” “
55878	55879	55880	55880	You	906	” “
55891	55904	55880	55880	You	906	” He pushes in deeper , rocking gently , in and out . “
55927	55931	55882	55884	a great actress	907	” he whispers . “
55937	56040	56041	56041	Max	1419	” My eyes drift closed as he moves deeper , filling me fully . The shock of him so thick inside me makes me shudder with pleasure . He rocks into me again , breath erratic . He ’s fucking me . Owning me . It ’s beyond anything . My hands are all over his chest , hungrily smoothing over hot skin and cool shirt . I push his shirt off him . I kiss his sweaty chest , learning the shape of his shoulders with my palms . I ’m the queen of the cats , plundering the catnip storeroom . “
56043	56044	56047	56047	baby	1419	” “
56051	56062	56047	56047	baby	1419	” He does me slowly , grinding against my pussy . “
56065	56079	56047	56047	baby	1419	” He says the word in time with the roll of his hips . “
56084	56085	56259	56259	Max	1419	” “
56089	56133	56259	56259	Max	1419	” I say . He replies with nonsense into my ear . The music of his voice is familiar , but this is a new key . I can feel him quickening , lost in a primal rhythm , old as the hills . “
56136	56148	56259	56259	Max	1419	” I grab his thumb and press it to my clit . “
56152	56156	56259	56259	Max	1419	” I say . “
56163	56173	56259	56259	Max	1419	” He does my clit while he fucks me . “
56177	56178	56259	56259	Max	1419	” “
56181	56258	56259	56259	Max	1419	” I gasp . He ’s grinding me and rubbing me . I ’m lost in us . An orgasm explodes over me , white - hot behind my eyes . I grip his arms as he cries out , a pleasure - pain sound that feels so Max - ish , I want to die . He stays in me a long time , forehead to mine . I bring my palm to his cheek . “
56261	56265	56270	56270	Mia	1866	” I say . “
56272	56306	56270	56270	Mia	1866	” he finally says . Neither of us say anything . There ’s just the sound of our breath and the press of our sweaty foreheads together . And then I just laugh . “
56312	56316	56317	56317	Us	908	” he ask . “
56319	56323	56317	56317	Us	908	” I say . “
56326	56331	56332	56332	We	908	” He pulls out . “
56344	56345	56338	56338	I	1493	” “
56356	56357	56338	56338	I	1493	” “
56360	56376	56377	56377	I	1493	” He whips a monogrammed hanky from his pocket and shoves it into my hand . “
56386	56387	56388	56388	I	1493	” “
56391	56392	56388	56388	I	1493	” “
56397	56411	56388	56388	I	1493	” He rips it from my hand and swipes it between my legs . “
56425	56435	56388	56388	I	1493	” He tosses it in a nearby garbage can . “
56452	56466	56388	56388	I	1493	” He rolls off his condom and gets rid of that , too . “
56469	56484	56388	56388	I	1493	” I pull myself together … as much as I can with ripped undergarments . “
56490	56494	56388	56388	I	1493	” I ask . “
56512	56526	56528	56528	me	1493	” He sits on a couch and pulls me down onto his lap . “
56530	56540	56528	56528	me	1493	” I say . He tips his head sideways . “
56565	56608	56609	56609	I	1493	” He explains his concept of this place . How he fought to make it happen . I slide my hand over his whiskers . I love the force of him . The confidence of him . He brushes back my hair . “
56635	56636	56629	56629	You	911	” “
56640	56641	56629	56629	You	911	” “
56652	56671	56643	56643	you	911	” I should talk about the book here , but I do n’t know how to start it . “
56681	56685	56686	56686	He	1419	” I say . “
56711	56712	56713	56713	Dude	115	” “
56727	56728	56713	56713	Dude	115	” “
56755	56756	56742	56742	Mia	1866	” “
56773	56802	56761	56761	we	912	” I press my fingers to his lips . I do n’t want to think about the worst day of my life . He pulls down my hand . “
56838	56839	56835	56835	I	1493	” “
56852	56853	56857	56857	Mia	1866	” “
56859	56860	56857	56857	Mia	1866	” “
56867	56873	56874	56874	I	1493	” He shakes his head . “
57012	57029	57005	57005	I	1493	” Something melts inside me . I was so mortified , I ’d barely seen him . “
57036	57037	57030	57030	You	911	” “
57050	57051	57039	57039	you	911	” “
57095	57109	57089	57089	I	1493	” He takes a curl in his fingers , knuckle brushing my cheek . “
57114	57115	57089	57089	I	1493	” “
57145	57146	57134	57134	I	1493	” “
57154	57158	57134	57134	I	1493	” he says . “
57184	57185	57186	57186	I	1493	” “
57198	57202	57186	57186	I	1493	” he says . “
57221	57222	57216	57216	you	911	” “
57267	57273	57263	57263	You	911	” He takes my hand . “
57301	57302	57294	57294	I	1493	” “
57308	57309	57310	57310	I	1493	” “
57315	57327	57310	57310	I	1493	” My heart skips a beat . Max kisses my finger . “
57334	57338	57328	57328	You	911	” I say . “
57344	57345	57346	57346	I	1493	” “
57354	57358	57346	57346	I	1493	” he says . “
57369	57373	57362	57362	I	1493	” he shrugs . “
57392	57428	57430	57430	you	911	” I sense worlds in his pause . A story — something sad . A place he does n’t want to go , and I want to respect that . I give him a smile . “
57437	57448	57430	57430	you	911	” He seems to snap back from wherever he went . “
57467	57488	57489	57489	Your	911	” I probably should n’t love that . I definitely should n’t want to climb all over him for it . “
57495	57499	57489	57489	Your	911	” I say . “
57506	57507	57500	57500	I	1493	” “
57516	57522	57500	57500	I	1493	” He kisses my cheek . “

57540	57603	57500	57500	I	1493	” I say . He slides his hands to my heart , resting it there on my chest . It ’s the most intimate thing he ’s done to me yet , because I know he can feel my heart pounding . And there ’s no fucking to take away the attention . I feel naked to him , bare to him . “
57615	57619	57609	57609	I	1493	” he says , “
57626	58036	58037	58037	Max	1419	” 18 The last thing you want is a woman you ca n’t walk away from . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia Kelsey ’s still sleeping when I wake up the next morning , which I ’m relieved about , because I do n’t know what I ’m going to say to her . But I need to say something . What happened between Max and me feels beyond words , but he still wrote that book that screwed up Kelsey ’s life . I shower and make coffee and scroll through my phone . There are texts from Ryan from last night . I read through them thinking about what Max and I were doing at 10:10 when Ryan wanted to know if we found any clues , at 10:50 when Ryan sent a shot of him and the intern in front of a double hydrant . Max and I went back to the party a little later . Max had an avalanche of duties , and I found Ryan and thanked him for bringing me . Ryan was only slightly disappointed that I was leaving ; he was having fun with the intern . I find a New Year ’s Day yoga class . All the coffee in my belly has n’t helped me figure out what to say to Kelsey , but maybe yoga will center me , and the teacher today is a hard one . I pull my winter coat over my yoga outfit and head out with my mat , walking the three blocks to class . The teacher instructs us to leave the world behind and be on the four corners of our mats , but it ’s not easy . Every inch of me feels suffused with Max . I slide my finger over my bottom lip between poses , remembering how it felt when he nipped me there . The heaviness of his hands on my thighs . How he sounded when he came . How it works is that I ’m in your corner . I lie on my mat after class , energized and serene . I want to see him . I feel like a stowaway on a forbidden ship , but I just do want to see him . I text him on the way home , and a second later , it rings . “
58039	58043	58044	58044	You	1419	” I say . “
58048	58049	58050	58050	I	1493	” “

58126	58127	58121	58121	Dunkin	206	” “
58148	58352	58133	58133	They	928	” There ’s a smile in his voice , and of course I say yes . I pop back home to face Kelsey . Instead I find a note . Where are you ? DETAILS ! BBL . I write , out to lunch ! And I scribble a heart . I ’m so afraid to tell her about Max . I tell myself I ’m going to talk to him about the book . Do my due diligence . I Google the dress code at The Plaza . It says smart casual , but elsewhere I see a suggestion for party dress , and I ’m all about that . I pull a pink party dress out of my closet and some fun black shoes with pink around the edges , and I ’m walking onto the street at 11 sharp in my fuzzy short coat . My belly flip - flops when catch sight of Max in a black overcoat , next to his even blacker town car . He smiles the half smile , opens his arms , and I go to him , a magnet to a lamppost . He holds me and kisses the top of my head . “
58355	58370	58133	58133	They	928	” he says into my hair . I crane my neck up at him . “
58373	58401	58133	58133	They	928	” He opens the door for me and I slide in . He slides in after me and closes us into the dark , warm back seat . “
58406	58415	58404	58404	you	929	” I say as the car starts moving . “
58448	58454	58455	58455	You	929	” He touches my hair . “

58481	58500	58465	58465	I	1493	” I slide in closer . I never had such an irresistible need to be close to somebody . “
58508	58534	58465	58465	I	1493	” He smiles . A small crinkle around the edges of his eyes — how did I never notice that ? I straighten his lapel . “
58557	58558	58465	58465	I	1493	” “
58566	58567	58465	58465	I	1493	” “
58573	58593	58465	58465	I	1493	” He puts his arm around me and pulls me closer . How am I so comfortable with him ? “

58696	58723	58682	58682	I	1493	” He was out there all that time ? In my world ? I ’m reviewing every show in my mind . What did he think ? “
58732	58733	58682	58682	I	1493	” “

58817	58826	58772	58772	God	69	” I grin and pull away his finger . “
58834	58874	58875	58875	I	1493	” It was the least flashy solo , but the range it demanded was madness , and I was proud how I nailed it , night after night . Not a lot of people noticed . Only the musicians . “
58886	58890	58875	58875	I	1493	” Max says . “
58917	58938	58911	58911	You	208	” I love that he noticed , that we have this language in common , even though he quit music . “
58956	58957	58942	58942	I	1493	” “
58965	58966	58942	58942	I	1493	” “

59066	59158	59057	59057	she	1866	” This is the place where I should bring up the book . But the car is stopping , and the door opens as if of its own accord , but of course it ’s a driver . Max gets out and extends a hand down to help me out . I take it , and he pulls me up to meet him . I feel fully like a princess now . He kisses me and introduces me to his driver , Kenneth , who seems happily surprised about the introduction . “
59161	59168	59057	59057	she	1866	” I say . Kenneth nods . “
59170	59292	59293	59293	I	1493	” It ’s such a small thing , Max introducing me to his driver , but it feels like he ’s bringing me deeper into his world . The place is glorious inside , all potted palms and towering French windows that flood the place with natural light . The place is a full white tablecloths and chandeliers explosion . Max sets his hand on the small of my back as the host leads us to our table . Guys I ’ve dated never touch me there unless they ’re being ironic or playing it for a joke . Like everything ’s just a joke . Man things are n’t a joke with Max . He leans in toward my ear . “
59306	59361	59293	59293	I	1493	” Everybody turns and watches us as we ’re seated next to the window . A few people come up and say hi to Max . He introduces me to some , but not to others . The ones he introduces me to , he always says something like , we go way back . “
59373	59379	59368	59368	we	938	” I observe between interruptions . “
59418	59425	59426	59426	You	937	” He picks up the menu . “
59433	59434	59435	59435	I	1493	” “
59439	59463	59464	59464	You	937	” I say . He gives me a look , that frank , open face of his that never appears on the ads . “
59470	59477	59464	59464	You	937	” Heat steals over my face . “
59481	59485	59464	59464	You	937	” I snort . “
59488	59535	59464	59464	You	937	” His half smile appears . The waiter comes up , but I do n’t want to take my eyes off Max and his half smile . He covers my hand with his and orders two New York teas and champagne , and the waiter leaves . “
59543	59544	59464	59464	You	937	” “

59932	59956	59957	59957	Parker	1419	” I ’m stupidly excited and trying not to grin too big . I feel celebrational , too . He adjusts his fork . “

59975	59981	59982	59982	I	1493	” He shakes his head . “

60030	60036	60037	60037	He	1419	” Max beams at me . “

60106	60132	60099	60099	He	1419	” We laugh about Parker businesses . The scones come . They ’re warm , served with clotted cream . I nearly die of bliss . “

60223	60364	60370	60370	Max	1419	” We try the different sandwiches . It ’s like we ’re right back how we were that summer . The way we go together , it feels like we were forged in the same oven , pieces from the same set that got separated , and now we ’re back , but better , because Max is all grown up , and there are exciting new sides of him . The song changes . It ’s background classical music , but it ’s not background - ish for Max . It ’s a song he once played really well . I secretly watch his expression . He probably has opinions on this version . I can see the knowledge in his eyes , following the notes . He could play it backward and forward . Back then , anyway . “
60400	60401	60402	60402	You	1866	” “
60411	60412	60402	60402	You	1866	” “
60420	60434	60402	60402	You	1866	” He turns his champagne glass in the light , studies the bubbles . “

60462	60479	60480	60480	I	1493	” There ’s a beat where I think he might not answer . Then he says , “
60487	60518	60519	60519	I	1493	” The admission hits me in the gut . I think back to him bent over that keyboard , working so hard . Did he hate it all that time ? “
60523	60529	60519	60519	I	1493	” I say , bewildered . “
60534	60535	60519	60519	I	1493	” “

60790	60807	60777	60777	I	1493	” He tips his silver butter knife this way and that , playing with the reflection . “
60835	60836	60839	60840	star quarterback	976	” “
60842	60846	60839	60840	star quarterback	976	” I say . “
60859	60883	60847	60847	You	1866	” A group seems about to approach us . Max uses his knife to cut a scone , and the group fades off . “
60911	60912	60909	60909	FYI	214	” “
60917	60925	60913	60913	You	1866	” He spreads cream onto the scone . “

The elevator doors shut and she leans back , hands on the rail behind her , luminous in her pink dress . “
61076	61080	60984	60984	me	1493	” she says . “
61086	61117	60984	60984	me	1493	” I go to her and cage her with my arms . I love her sassy smile . I love that she gives me shit about the Max Hilton lines . “
61123	61195	60984	60984	me	1493	” she teases . I shut her up with a kiss . She grabs my shirt , pulls me in hard . I ’m stunned all over again at how well we fit . The more time I spend with her , the less I want to let her go back to her apartment , her job , her world . The door opens and we ’re there . She turns . “
61203	61204	60984	60984	me	1493	” “
61212	61213	60984	60984	me	1493	” “
61219	61264	60984	60984	me	1493	” I can hear the smile on her lips as she says it . More Max Hilton mockery , but she likes that I ’ve built this . Mia loves competence . She always has . I hang behind and watch her look around . “
61272	61320	61321	61321	Somebody	1462	” she asks . It takes me a moment to realize what she ’s talking about — a massive posterized image of lips that was above the fireplace once upon a time . My designer hung it as a favor to the artist for the magazine shoots . “
61339	61340	61341	61341	You	982	” “
61345	61349	61350	61350	You	982	” she says . “
61366	61395	61360	61360	Somebody	1462	” She goes to the window and peers out over the park . I go up behind her . I move her hair aside and kiss her neck . “
61404	61505	61360	61360	Somebody	1462	” She turns around in my arms . Her look says , are n’t you so full of yourself ? It also says , I do love your own face . She kisses me and pulls away to continue her self - guided tour around the living room . I love the sense of ease between us . I never brought women home into my private spaces . Never introduced them to my driver or made confessions about the music . But no woman is Mia . She runs her hand over the nubby blue couch and the antique lamp . “
61523	61593	61597	61597	you	984	” She turns around and looks at the painting above the fireplace . I bought it at a flea market in Amsterdam . It ’s a crow in a tree , done in bold , heavy black strokes on a bright blue background . It ’s not at all realistic , but there ’s something I just love about it . I want her to love it , too . “
61599	61603	61597	61597	you	984	” she says . “

61667	61727	61649	61649	people	1466	” I do n’t love that she ’d say that . We ’ve been trying to modulate that image lately . Not enough to defang the brand , but corporate responsibility is a thing with me these days . It ’s a lot of what Catwalk for a Cause is about . She moves on into the dining room . “
61744	61745	61746	61746	I	1493	” “
61756	61790	61746	61746	I	1493	” She looks thoughtful , as though she has something more to say . I think she ’s about to tell me , but then she spots the hot tub on the porch . “
61803	61817	61793	61793	Max	266	” She points to the corner of the cover where steam leaks up . “
61826	61827	61793	61793	Max	266	” “

61848	61892	61839	61839	Decadence	1753	” She gives the Max Hilton line an eye roll and I go to her , slide a knuckle along her jaw , down her neck , down the smooth silky bodice of her dress . I ’m imagining her naked in there . “
61906	61907	61900	61900	You	988	” “
61913	61914	61915	61915	I	1493	” “
61925	61933	61915	61915	I	1493	” She gives me a sassy smile . “

61961	61980	61981	61981	I	1493	” I slowly unzip her dress , kissing my way down , unwrapping her like an erotic confection . “
61991	62055	61981	61981	I	1493	” Her breath speeds . I love that I can affect her this way . I plant kiss after kiss along her spine . My cock is rock hard as I push her dress down in front of the panorama of the park . Her whole body shudders as I pull down her panties , get her to step out of her clothes . “
62059	62091	61981	61981	I	1493	” I grate . She takes it off and flings it in true Mia style . It lands on the couch . I stand , running my hands over her hips . “
62095	62154	61981	61981	I	1493	” She gives me a wicked look over her shoulder , and I ’m so overcome with affection , I forget how to breathe . Just her standing there naked is all my fantasies from that lost summer coming true , but so much better . She goes to slip off her shoes , but I stop her . “
62168	62172	61981	61981	I	1493	” I growl . “
62181	62213	61981	61981	I	1493	” I wrap my arms around her from behind , slide my hand down over her pussy . One stroke and her whole body quivers . In her ear I whisper , “
62227	62241	62217	62217	We	990	” She gasps as I stroke again . I hold her more tightly . “
62249	62253	62242	62242	You	991	” I say . “
62277	62295	62269	62269	I	1493	” I finger her some more , waiting for the feeling of her melting in my arms . “
62326	62343	62321	62321	I	1493	” She turns all the way around now , with a hazy look in her eyes . “
62346	62352	62321	62321	I	1493	” I lower my voice . “
62366	62367	62370	62370	Hilton	266	” “
62372	62381	62370	62370	Hilton	266	” She pushes my jacket off my shoulders . “
62387	62417	62370	62370	Hilton	266	” I kiss her the way she seems to like — soft and slow , though there ’s nothing soft and slow about how I want to take her . “
62464	62487	62488	62488	I	1493	” I slide my hands over her chest , her hips , learning her curves , the silky warmth of her skin . “
62537	62538	62521	62521	I	1493	” “
62545	62624	62626	62626	me	1493	” she whispers huskily . I hoist her up ; her legs lock around my waist like it ’s the most natural thing in the world , like she was always meant to be flush against me . I carry her over to the table and put her down , threading my fingers through her soft curls before I fist her hair at the nape of her neck . Her eyes go unfocused as I tighten my grip . “
62628	62677	62626	62626	me	1493	” I whisper . I kiss her while she fumbles at my pants . I want her hands on me again . I loved the reverent way she touched my cock last night . The way she kissed it . She takes me in her hand and squeezes . “
62681	62685	62626	62626	me	1493	” I whisper . “
62744	62785	62742	62742	you	1493	” I spin her around . There ’s nothing gentle about the way I press her down on the table . She makes little begging sounds as I push aside her folds , press one finger in , then another . “
62789	62824	62825	62825	I	1493	” I grate . She angles up her hips as I press myself in . As I lose myself in her . She cries out . I slide my hands all over her back . “
62830	62888	62828	62828	baby	1753	” I cover her , fucking her . I reach around and do her , lost in the sounds of her pleasure . Lost in her . Never have I lost myself in a woman so completely . Some time later , we ’re in the tub . I have her foot . She has the view . “
62899	62948	62949	62949	You	1753	” I say . Her smile gets me in a way I ca n’t describe . Her smile draws me to her . Across the room , across the bed , across the dark bubbly water . I slide my hand up her calf , smooth and warm . “
62959	62963	62955	62955	I	1493	” she says . “
62968	63002	62955	62955	I	1493	” She reaches over the side and grabs one of the Italian chocolates a design house sent over . She closes her eyes and moans as she lets it melt in her mouth . “
63014	63015	62955	62955	I	1493	” “
63032	63041	63042	63042	You	1753	” I massage the ball of her foot . “
63047	63051	63052	63052	You	1753	” she says . “
63057	63058	63052	63052	You	1753	” “
63068	63087	63052	63052	You	1753	” The silence stretches long , punctuated by horns honking below . The ambient noise of Fifth Avenue . “
63099	63122	63089	63089	I	1493	” She opens her eyes and gazes at me from across the steam . Like she has a thousand thoughts . What ? “
63145	63146	63147	63147	I	1493	” “
63159	63165	63147	63147	I	1493	” Something inside me twists . “
63168	63169	63147	63147	I	1493	” “
63179	63180	63147	63147	I	1493	” “
63202	63210	63191	63191	I	1493	” I move onto the next toe . “
63237	63256	63231	63231	guys	1756	” This gives me pause . The book has always had haters . I tend to ignore them . “
63267	63268	63231	63231	guys	1756	” “
63302	63321	63294	63294	they	998	” I frown . What happened to her ? Low and slow through grit teeth , I ask , “
63328	63329	63323	63323	somebody	1462	” “
63382	63383	63377	63377	they	998	” “
63399	63400	63401	63401	She	1866	” “
63405	63429	63401	63401	She	1866	” I do n’t know what to say . I stare out at the park , so many brown trees tipped with snow . “
63451	63452	63437	63437	he	262	” “
63500	63506	63496	63496	I	1493	” I frown , confused . “
63515	63516	63496	63496	I	1493	” “
63533	63534	63535	63535	Ouch	216	” “
63537	63541	63535	63535	Ouch	216	” I say . “
63555	63556	63542	63542	I	1493	” “
63559	63563	63542	63542	I	1493	” I say , “
63586	63587	63542	63542	I	1493	” “
63617	63618	63542	63542	I	1493	” “
63630	63634	63542	63542	I	1493	” I say . “
63658	63671	63653	63653	you	1013	” She ’s shaking her head . Is this our first fight ? “
63693	63732	63733	63733	You	1013	” Mia ’s cheeks are rosy from the steam . She looks cherubic , but she ’s a cherub on the warpath . She was always fiercely loyal . She ’d fight to the death for a friend . “
63746	63747	63733	63733	You	1013	” “
63752	63756	63733	63733	You	1013	” I say . “
63787	63788	63761	63761	you	1013	” “
63826	63827	63761	63761	you	1013	” “
63832	63836	63761	63761	you	1013	” she says . “
63867	63891	63892	63892	I	1493	” I think back on my state of mind when I wrote the book . The apartment above a grocer in Little Italy . “
63900	63928	63892	63892	I	1493	” I say . What the hell was she doing reading that book ? And then I get the real trouble here . Or part of it . “
63937	63938	63930	63930	Kelsey	1866	” “
63961	63962	63963	63963	I	1493	” “
63980	63981	63972	63972	You	1493	” “
64018	64019	64021	64021	everyone	1456	” “
64023	64027	64021	64021	everyone	1456	” I say . “
64061	64062	64056	64056	they	1027	” “
64069	64127	64056	64056	they	1027	” I say . She gives me a hard look . As though I ’m being arrogant . I rub her foot , staring into the bubbly depths of the hot tub . I do n’t feel like I did anything wrong , but it ’s always possible I ’m not seeing all the sides of this . “
64157	64158	64159	64159	You	1493	” “
64184	64209	64177	64178	real people	1029	” I frown . If nothing else , I ’m thinking I need to look at that book again . She narrows her eyes . “
64223	64224	64225	64225	I	1493	” “
64229	64230	64225	64225	I	1493	” “
64259	64260	64263	64263	baby	1753	” “
64278	64396	64265	64265	you	1032	” I say . She snorts , but my mind is whirring . I wo n’t be the boyfriend that all her friends hate . No way , that ’s not acceptable . We get take - out from the little Indian place down the street and I press her for more details on the way back . We spend the rest of the night sprawled on the couch , watching musicals on the big - screen TV and singing along , something I can do with exactly zero other people . We begin with the serious warhorses , starting with HMS Pinafore . We sing along to every song . She ’s such an amazing singer . “
64405	64413	64414	64414	I	1493	” she asks me at one point . “
64431	64432	64424	64424	I	1493	” “
64442	64536	64537	64537	I	1493	” She tilts her head . Interested . Caring . I grab a bottle of wine and two glasses . I never talk about my late nanny , Annette , not even to Parker . I never wanted to . But I want to tell Mia . So I pour the wine , and I tell her the story . What an important part of my life Annette was — more important than my parents in many ways . How I did n’t even know how to be playful until Annette came along . “
64622	64740	64611	64611	She	171	” Mia threads her fingers into mine . Listening . Caring . When did I stop sharing things ? When did I build this wall around myself ? When did I stop letting people in ? Always deflecting . Everything Max Hilton . Jokes and cocktail hour . I do n’t know if I 'm telling the story right . I ’m sure I ’m not . It ’s hard to explain about Annette , the only sunshine in a grim childhood of scales and drills . Sitting on that bench until I was dropping from fatigue . And then she died in that crash . And a few years later , the Shiz was my escape . “
64752	64765	64747	64747	you	1042	” she observes . And then I see when the understanding dawns . “
64786	64787	64776	64776	I	1493	” “
64798	64802	64776	64776	I	1493	” I say . “
64808	64812	64776	64776	I	1493	” she says . “
64816	64842	64776	64776	I	1493	” I say . There ’s nothing much to add to it . We tossed it away . Retreated to our corners . Insecure teens . “
64849	64850	64776	64776	I	1493	” “
64860	64861	64854	64854	They	1043	” “
64869	64876	64867	64867	Annette	171	” she says . I shrug . “
64887	64891	64877	64877	I	1493	” she says . “
64906	64910	64901	64901	Your	1042	” I say . “
64914	64960	64901	64901	Your	1042	” She trolls through the streaming menu , looking for a new musical to watch . I wind my fingers through her hair , thinking how there ’s nobody else I could do this with . Talk . Sing . Nobody else in the world . “
64969	64973	64961	64961	We	1044	” I say . “
64981	64996	64974	64974	We	1044	” She widens her eyes . Calle Corrientes is the Broadway of Buenos Aires . “
65005	65006	65007	65007	I	1493	” “
65026	65027	65030	65030	I	1493	” “
65052	65197	65198	65198	I	1493	” I tuck her hair behind her ear . I rarely take trips for just pleasure . I never had the urge until her . 20 Never ask a woman what she wants . Tell her what she wants . ~The Max Hilton Playbook : Ten Golden Rules for Landing the Hottest Girl in the Room Mia It ’s hard to go back to reality after that long weekend with Max . Hard to put the Meow Squad uniform back on . The good news : Max is still on my route . The first day back , I bring him a lunch of my own choosing . Which is convenient because , even though I left him just hours before , I suddenly have a whole list of things I need to tell him about . Plus an insatiable need to touch him . “
65203	65210	65198	65198	I	1493	” I say , kissing him . “
65218	65228	65198	65198	I	1493	” I tear myself away and turn the cart . “
65242	65263	65198	65198	I	1493	” I still . It ’s a Tuesday night . The night he customarily goes to the secret yoga place . “
65274	65275	65198	65198	I	1493	” “
65287	65297	65276	65276	You	1493	” I nod . He scribbles down an address . “
65312	65313	65308	65308	you	1493	” “
65321	65322	65308	65308	you	1493	” “
65328	65332	65308	65308	you	1493	” he says . “
65339	65340	65334	65334	I	1493	” “
65345	65364	65334	65334	I	1493	” I finally see Kelsey at home after work . She ’s already in her dance workout clothes . “
65368	65372	65334	65334	I	1493	” she says . “
65394	65406	65407	65409	Every last one	1048	” I go in and change , feeling like an asshole . “
65411	65438	65407	65409	Every last one	1048	” she calls out . Five minutes later we ’re traipsing the block avenue to her dance studio , and she has her arm in mine . “
65441	65448	65449	65449	Ryan	190	” I take a deep breath . “
65456	65464	65449	65449	Ryan	190	” I say . Her dimples deepen . “
65471	65490	65449	65449	Ryan	190	” I take my arm from hers and stop , pulling her from the stream of pedestrian traffic . “
65493	65494	65495	65495	Max	266	” “
65497	65505	65506	65506	Max	266	” I say . Her dimples disappear . “
65512	65513	65506	65506	Max	266	” “
65528	65529	65531	65531	me	1493	” “
65539	65540	65535	65535	Mia	1866	” “

65589	65609	65610	65610	Max	266	” Nathan wrecked your life , I think , but is that me drinking the Max Kool - Aid ? “
65661	65662	65664	65664	he	1049	” “
65668	65669	65664	65664	he	1049	” “

65691	65709	65710	65710	I	1493	” She presses her palms to her eyes . I grab her arms , pull them down . “
65746	65747	65748	65748	Mia	1866	” “
65750	65754	65748	65748	Mia	1866	” she says . “

65778	65802	65803	65803	He	1049	” She ’s silent all the way to the next corner , thinking . But at least she ’s holding onto my arm . “
65822	65833	65811	65811	He	1049	” She turns to me at the Do n’t Walk . “
65931	65932	65933	65933	I	1493	” “
65944	65953	65940	65940	I	1493	” She rests her hands on my shoulders . “

65978	65982	65983	65983	He	1058	” I say . “

66174	66183	66184	66184	He	1058	” She whips her gaze around to me . “

66486	66571	66484	66484	Jesus	223	” She sniffs and takes my arm again . 21 Open your eyes . Start seeing what ’s in front of your face . This is an uncorrected proof - you may find typos , but those wo n’t be in the final version . Mia I ’m outside the Namaste Way Yoga building at a quarter after eight . Only the windows on the top floor are lit . A woman comes out the door with a pack of cigarettes and a lighter . “
66577	66581	66582	66582	I	1493	” she asks . “
66589	66590	66591	66591	Max	266	” “

66646	66678	66623	66623	I	1493	” She puts the cigarette into her mouth and cups her hand , shielding the lighter flame from the wind . I add my hand , and the thing finally lights . “
66681	66697	66623	66623	I	1493	” she says , blowing a stream of smoke from the side of her mouth . “

66726	66942	66724	66724	you	1490	” I say . I go in and study the directory , reluctant to go up . Was Kelsey right ? Is he just a master player ? Because , banging and pounding ? I find Namaste Way on the directory . Studio 503 . It takes up half the entire floor , and it doubles as a ballet studio . It ’s pretty common for yoga studios to share spaces with ballet studios . All that expanse of wood flooring . Not cheap . I take the elevator and get out on the fifth floor , dreading what I ’ll find . As I head down , I hear music — Bach — played badly . Noisily . What . The . Hell . Camouflage for the banging ? I draw nearer . No way is it Max . No way could Max have lost his abilities so completely . Is this some sort of perverse live accompaniment to whatever is happening ? The same prelude is played again , but this time , it ’s played beautifully . And then it ’s played poorly again . I draw nearer to the door . Is he having dueling pianos with his alternate shitty - at - piano self ? And then Max ’s voice . “
66945	66951	66724	66724	you	1490	” A string of notes . “
66999	67121	67123	67123	you	1069	” I hear murmuring . Not Max . It ’s a kid . Notes . Faltering stops and starts . A few more stabs . I blink , unsure what I ’m hearing . There ’s more talk about voices . Notes . It seems that Max … is teaching a piano lesson ? Yes . A piano lesson . Laughing , drink - swirling , Ferrari - driving Max secretly teaches piano ? Suddenly there ’s the sound of shuffling . Mumbled questions . Footsteps . I step aside as the door opens . A kid comes out . He ’s maybe thirteen . He nods and heads to the elevator . The door closes behind him . I knock . “
67126	67159	67123	67123	you	1069	” The door flings open and I ’m face - to - face with Max . His shirtsleeves are rolled up ; his tie hangs loose . My heart skips a beat . “
67176	67180	67167	67167	I	1493	” he says . “
67186	67187	67181	67181	Somebody	1462	” “
67202	67253	67181	67181	Somebody	1462	” He ’s tentative . Did he not want me to find out ? I push in and look around until I find it — the piano , glinting in a dark corner . I go to it , ignoring the click of the door . The footsteps behind me . “
67261	67266	67181	67181	Somebody	1462	” I ask stupidly . “
67269	67275	67181	67181	Somebody	1462	” Arms snake around me . “
67286	67348	67181	67181	Somebody	1462	” I say . Or at least , most things I do n’t get . I sit at the bench and run my fingers lightly over the keys . It ’s a Kawai — a nice one . That ’s the kind Max would prefer , I think with a rush of affection . He ’d want it for the tone . “
67355	67356	67349	67349	You	1069	” “
67359	67368	67349	67349	You	1069	” he says . I turn to him . “
67393	67400	67401	67401	I	1493	” He look at me strangely . “
67409	67424	67401	67401	I	1493	” He sits down at the bench next to me and plunks the middle C. “
67443	67444	67433	67433	I	1493	” “
67451	67452	67433	67433	I	1493	” “
67463	67499	67433	67433	I	1493	” It comes to me here just how much he hated being made to play . To perform . The child prodigy alone on the stage . I feel this wave of compassion for him . “
67505	67506	67507	67507	I	1493	” “
67545	67570	67537	67538	a kid	2232	” Goosebumps prickle over me . He wants to give them a chance to love music . To have what he did n’t have . “
67580	67585	67537	67538	a kid	2232	” I ask softly . “
67590	67591	67537	67538	a kid	2232	” “
67594	67627	67537	67538	a kid	2232	” I trace a finger over the cool , glossy keys . I play part of a scale . I can feel him cringe . He used to play scales so perfectly . “
67641	67649	67637	67639	A baby grand	1074	” He gives me a jaded look . “
67663	67667	67650	67650	You	1069	” I snort . “
67679	67680	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	” “
67684	67690	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	” He plunks another note . “
67700	67701	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	” “
67703	67722	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	” from Olympus on My Mind for my comic one . It ’s a little risky . Bawdy . ”
67723	67735	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	“ I love that for Reno . A big personality piece . ”
67736	67765	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	“ I have that one down cold , but my challenge is ‘ How Could I Ever Know ? ’ from The Secret Garden . It ’s tricky . ”
67766	67778	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	“ But it would show off your high notes like crazy . ”
67779	67788	67681	67682	Employees kids	1077	“ Right ? It goes up to F5 . ”
67789	67797	67798	67798	He	266	“ You know you can nail that . ”
67825	67830	67819	67819	he	266	“ You know it ? ”
67834	67838	67839	67839	He	266	“ Not really . ”
67849	67857	67839	67839	He	266	“ You ’re going to play it ? ”
67858	67879	67880	67880	He	266	“ I want to hear you sing it , and I ’m thinking that ’s the only way that happens . ”
67891	67897	67887	67887	My	1493	“ I want to hear . ”
68014	68019	68020	68020	he	266	“ Train ’s leaving , ”
68377	68383	68374	68374	He	266	“ Where did you go ? ”
68384	68389	68374	68374	He	266	“ I feel sad . ”
68399	68412	68413	68413	He	266	“ We really do deserve that award . For friggin ’ boneheadedness . ”
68429	68435	68425	68425	he	266	“ You want to stop ? ”
68436	68440	68441	68441	I	1493	“ Hell no . ”
68571	68579	68580	68580	he	266	“ You are gon na kill it , ”
68583	68591	68592	68592	He	266	“ And the role is for you . ”
68617	68621	68622	68622	he	266	“ You hungry ? ”
68625	68630	68622	68622	he	266	“ I ’m hungry . ”
68631	68651	68677	68677	Ralazzio	1490	“ If you ’re hinting that you want me to serve you a sandwich , you can forget it . ”
68652	68676	68677	68677	Ralazzio	1490	“ Let ’s go out . I have a standing reservation at Ralazzio . We have more than enough time to get there . ”
68701	68712	68713	68713	he	266	“ Do n’t tell me you have plans after this ? ”
68716	68744	68745	68745	He	266	“ My friend Jada has invited people to join her for drinks for her wrap . At The Wilder Club . This little place near our apartment . ”
68751	68762	68745	68745	He	266	“ Jada is your friend with the jungle kiss experience ? ”
68763	68790	68745	68745	He	266	“ Yeah , but she always has wrap parties . She ’s in a lot of small quick shows . It ’s not like , mandatory . ”
68791	68799	68745	68745	He	266	“ Will Kelsey be there , too ? ”
68800	68805	68745	68745	He	266	“ Kelsey’ll be there . ”
68874	68878	68859	68859	I	1493	“ You good ? ”
68879	68896	68897	68897	he	266	“ Yeah . I ’ve always wanted to meet the people who draw moustaches on me , ”
68952	68957	68958	68958	I	1493	“ Two local brews , ”
68961	68968	68958	68958	I	1493	“ Is that the drink here ? ”
68969	68972	68973	68973	I	1493	“ Yup . ”
69069	69080	69081	69081	I	1493	“ A little different from what you ’re used to , ”
69093	69100	69101	69101	He	266	“ I love seeing your life . ”
69166	69179	69180	69180	I	1493	“ For the love of god , do n’t put the location , ”
69192	69201	69202	69203	the one	394	“ Oh my god , we wo n’t , ”
69206	69213	69202	69203	the one	394	“ The place would be mobbed . ”
69220	69223	69224	69224	I	1493	“ You . ”
69239	69248	69249	69249	he	549	“ Nobody puts their hands on my flower , ”
69252	69257	69258	69258	I	1493	“ Except maybe Kelsey ? ”
69265	69276	69277	69277	Antonio	549	“ Can Kelsey put a hand on your … flower ? ”
69284	69294	69295	69295	He	549	“ It is in no way like a flower . ”
69300	69304	69295	69295	He	549	“ And you ! ”
69305	69313	69314	69314	I	1493	“ Dude . The jig is up . ”
69323	69358	69359	69359	Antonio	549	“ Max , this is my cousin Antonio . He ’s awesome and studying to be an actor . Antonio , Max is with me . And you ’re not a murderous gigolo anymore . ”
69375	69383	69384	69384	Max	266	“ You had that poor boy shaken , ”
69435	69443	69444	69444	Max	266	“ Have you ever thought about modeling ? ”
69448	69460	69461	69461	Antonio	549	“ I mean , if the acting does n’t work out . ”
69485	69491	69492	69492	Antonio	549	“ And for the record , ”
69495	69502	69492	69492	Antonio	549	“ I was kissing my thumb . ”
69503	69514	69515	69515	I	1493	“ He was kissing his thumb , it ’s true , ”
69519	69523	69515	69515	I	1493	“ So was I. ”
69558	69562	69551	69551	Antonio	549	“ He knows . ”
69667	69672	69673	69673	Kelsey	1866	“ Oh , look , ”
69705	69711	69700	69700	Jada	1475	“ You carry it around ? ”
69712	69730	69731	69731	he	549	“ I ’ve been re - reading it . I want to know your experience with it , ”
69734	69749	69731	69731	he	549	“ You do n’t have to tell me , but I want to know . ”
69750	69764	69765	69765	Jada	1475	“ How I ended up with a jungle - kissing reverse - chaser ? ”
69768	69775	69765	69765	Jada	1475	“ How Kelsey lived with one ? ”
69781	69795	69796	69796	Kelsey	1866	“ I do n’t know if I feel like spooling it all out . ”
69869	69884	69885	69885	He	77	“ He seemed so funny and unique , but it was all your lines ! ”
69904	69915	69970	69970	She	1866	“ I didn’t … think it through from that angle . ”
69916	69923	69924	69924	Jada	1475	“ It ’s not an angle , ”
69927	69969	69970	69970	She	1866	“ It ’s a freaking ruse . I specifically gave a guy the benefit of the doubt because of that cute dog story and it was n’t real . I felt deceived , and I feel like your book encourages that . ”
70010	70022	70023	70023	he	77	“ It was a bit much to suggest they memorize it , ”
70027	70036	70023	70023	he	77	“ They should have their own unique thing . ”
70037	70045	70046	70046	Jada	1475	“ Yeah , that ’s a start . ”
70055	70068	70069	70069	he	77	“ I did n’t mean for it to be used that way , ”
70072	70077	70069	70069	he	77	“ I ’m sorry . ”
70078	70085	70086	70086	Kelsey	1866	“ Thank you for saying that , ”
70089	70095	70098	70098	she	1866	“ I do appreciate it . ”
70123	70128	70129	70129	Max	266	“ I mean it , ”
70132	70179	70129	70129	Max	266	“ And I think sorry is n’t enough . I ’m thinking about doing a new edition . I talked to my publisher and they ’ll go for it if I write it . I can encourage guys to be confident and interesting without being fake . ”
70180	70190	70191	70191	Jada	1475	“ You ’re thinking about doing a new edition ? ”
70299	70308	70309	70309	he	1115	“ There ’s something you ’re not saying , ”
70324	70479	70312	70312	Kelsey	1866	“ It ’s not just about my experience ; in fact that ’s the least of it . Because I ’ll own right now that I had a part in what happened with Nathan — your book helped get him in the door , but it was on me to see him for what he was . To not be blinded by his looks . But here ’s the thing — I got burned by a guy who read your book . He only read it . You wrote it . You put down every single one of those words . How can I trust you to be good to Mia when this is the way you were directing guys to behave ? People change , but do they really ? Or do they just get better at hiding shit ? So if you think I ’m not saying something … that ’s it . ”
70480	70487	70488	70488	I	1493	“ He ’s not that guy , ”
70491	70504	70505	70505	Max	266	“ You need to give me a little credit here , Kelsey . ”
70512	70522	70523	70523	he	266	“ I ’m going to prove you guys wrong , ”
70526	70532	70533	70533	Kelsey	1866	“ I want you to , ”
70540	70548	70533	70533	Kelsey	1866	“ To you , proving me wrong . ”
70549	70555	70556	70556	I	1493	“ He ’s gon na , ”
70662	70671	70672	70672	Lizzie	61	“ I ’m curious about your pickup system , ”
70682	70720	70672	70672	Lizzie	61	“ How did you develop it ? How did you know what would work ? You were twenty years old without much experience dating from the sound of it . Was there some sort of testing protocol ? ”
70769	70784	70785	70785	he	266	“ I was … on the other end of it , in a way , ”
70788	70792	70793	70793	I	1493	“ The system ? ”
70797	70803	70804	70804	Kelsey	1866	“ What does that mean ? ”
70807	70816	70804	70804	Kelsey	1866	“ A woman did a system on you ? ”
70817	70843	70844	70844	I	1493	“ It was n’t a system , not anything anybody was consciously doing . It was just … observing the effect of her on me . ”
70872	70881	70882	70882	I	1493	“ I ’ve had enough of this topic , ”
70885	70890	70891	70891	Jada	1475	“ I have n’t ! ”
70894	70900	70891	70891	Jada	1475	“ I want to know . ”
70912	70919	70920	70920	Max	266	“ She was playful and outrageous , ”
70923	70938	70939	70939	Antonio	549	“ A little bit bossy . And so goddamn beautiful , it killed me . ”
70972	70980	70981	70981	Max	266	“ She was a force of nature , ”
70984	71022	71023	71023	Kelsey	1866	“ And the outrageous things she ’d do . With every little thing she did , I ’d just want her more . She dressed so brightly when I first met her . Loud colors and metallics . ”
71028	71034	71023	71023	Kelsey	1866	“ The alpha - signaling . ”
71041	71044	71045	71045	Max	266	“ Yup , ”
71048	71058	71059	71059	Max	266	“ Like she was anointing herself . Choosing herself . ”
71075	71088	71089	71089	he	266	“ She was the bravest , boldest woman I ’d ever met , ”
71092	71142	71089	71089	he	266	“ She came up poor ; she was n’t supposed to even leave her tiny town , but she set her sights high , believed in herself when nobody else would . She ’d literally bulldoze you with her reality . And god , the stories she would tell ! ”
71150	71156	71143	71143	I	1493	“ What are you doing ? ”
71157	71221	71226	71226	My	1493	“ We started out enemies , but one summer we did this musical together , and it was the best summer of my life . But I screwed it up , and we were enemies again . Even so , I ’d sneak into Miedlow Hall and listen to her sing . I could n’t stay away from her . I loved her . ”
71222	71225	71226	71226	My	1493	“ What ? ”
71252	71275	71239	71239	I	1493	“ When I left high school , I was sure I ’d lost my chance at love . I wrote the book . ”
71276	71286	71287	71287	Antonio	549	“ Love ruins a man . Just walk away , ”
71295	71298	71290	71290	I	1493	“ Max ? ”
71299	71307	71310	71310	he	549	“ It was easy to go hard . ”
71326	71344	71315	71315	I	1493	“ They say cynics are just disillusioned idealists . Writers of pickup books are just heartbroken romantics . ”
71349	71353	71354	71354	Kelsey	1866	“ Jesus Christ ! ”
71357	71362	71354	71354	Kelsey	1866	“ It was Mia . ”
71370	71413	71363	71363	Antonio	549	“ He wrote it because he could n’t have Mia . His heart was broken in pieces . So he goes off to warn other men . Never pursue a woman you ca n’t walk away from . Never fall in love . ”
71414	71417	71418	71418	I	1493	“ Max , ”
71429	71472	71422	71422	Max	266	“ I just love you , that ’s all . I ’m not saying that so you say it back . In fact , I do n’t want that right now , but Lizzie asked how I came up with the system . ”
71503	71510	71511	71511	I	1493	“ Excuse me , Max Hilton ? ”
71527	71532	71533	71534	the one	394	“ Sorry to interrupt , ”
71537	71550	71551	71551	Max	266	“ but it ’s my friend ’s birthday … would you mind … ”
71567	71578	71579	71579	he	394	“ As long as you do n’t give the location , ”
71582	71587	71588	71588	Jada	1475	“ God , right ? ”
71617	71622	71623	71623	she	1866	“ Okay , okay , ”
71626	71630	71623	71623	she	1866	“ That works . ”
71908	71916	71898	71898	Max	266	“ So this is where you live . ”
71917	71922	71923	71923	I	1493	“ Do n’t laugh , ”
71926	71930	71931	71931	His	266	“ It ’s … ”
71973	71986	71987	71987	He	1499	“ I know it ’s not much , but we like it . ”
72029	72034	72035	72035	He	51	“ No , Max . ”
72050	72057	72040	72040	His	1499	“ What do we have here ? ”
72058	72065	72066	72066	My	1493	“ Max . It ’s nothing . ”
72076	72079	72066	72066	My	1493	“ Nothing . ”

72127	72132	72124	72124	Kelsey	1866	“ A stupid joke . ”
72133	72143	72144	72144	He	51	“ Does n’t look like a joke to me . ”
72185	72199	72202	72202	he	51	“ I was wondering how you all knew so much about the book . ”
72209	72214	72215	72215	Lizzie	61	“ I did that . ”
72218	72224	72215	72215	Lizzie	61	“ That was all me . ”
72225	72228	72229	72229	I	1493	“ Max , ”
72232	72239	72229	72229	I	1493	“ It was a stupid thing . ”
72262	72277	72280	72280	he	51	“ That was how it started , but it ’s not how it ended . ”
72354	72376	72348	72348	he	51	“ Stop staring at those stupid things ! It was before I realized how I felt about you , before I — ”
72377	72384	72385	72385	he	51	“ Yet you kept them up , ”
72393	72401	72385	72385	he	51	“ Look at all the X ’s . ”
72402	72411	72348	72348	he	51	“ Max , no ! Look at me . ”
72412	72423	72348	72348	he	51	“ You did n’t complete a few of the rules . ”
72437	72452	72348	72348	he	51	“ Then again , you brought me to my knees , did n’t you ? ”
72453	72496	72497	72497	He	51	“ It was a dumb thing . From when I thought you arranged the visits . Please , listen to me ! I freaked out when I saw you on my roster . I was scared . Look at me , Max ! ”
72558	72567	72568	72568	I	1493	“ It ’s not what it looks like , ”
72575	72582	72572	72572	He	51	“ Grovelly is n’t an adjective . ”
72605	72620	72621	72621	He	51	“ It ’s not like that , Max . You have it so wrong . ”
72627	72632	72621	72621	He	51	“ Darts ? Really ? ”
72633	72652	72659	72659	he	51	“ Let ’s talk . We can work this out . History does n’t have to repeat itself . ”
72653	72658	72659	72659	he	51	“ It already has , ”
72676	72685	72691	72691	He	51	“ This does n’t have to be us . ”
72704	72732	72735	72735	he	51	“ Word of advice . If you ’re going to sell your soul for a pair of Louboutins , at least make them this year ’s model . ”

72997	73002	72991	72991	He	51	“ What the hell ? ”
73003	73013	72941	72941	I	1493	“ How is he ? Is he … okay ? ”
73014	73032	72991	72991	He	51	“ Jesus , Mia , no . What were you guys thinking ? Who even does that . ”
73033	73047	72991	72991	He	51	“ I thought he ’d called me there to mock me or something ! ”

73056	73066	73067	73067	I	1493	“ I know I screwed up . So bad . ”
73075	73083	73067	73067	I	1493	“ Reconnecting with Max has been everything . ”
73084	73093	73094	73094	Parker	1419	“ Well , he ’s pretty angry now , ”
73097	73135	73094	73094	Parker	1419	“ It ’s partly my fault . I should n’t have gotten involved . I just always thought you two belonged together . You were enemies for so long , but nobody got him going like you . ”
73136	73142	73143	73143	I	1493	“ We do belong together , ”
73146	73157	73143	73143	I	1493	“ Bring Max Hilton to his knees chart ? Darts ? ”
73158	73164	73165	73165	He	1419	“ What can I do ? ”
73186	73192	73143	73143	I	1493	“ Maybe another ten years . ”
73193	73196	73197	73197	I	1493	“ No , ”
73540	73547	73548	73548	she	1866	“ Guess what else I brought , ”
73565	73579	73580	73580	I	1493	“ I ’m not going to sit out here doing a cross stitch , ”
73583	73596	73580	73580	I	1493	“ I want him to see that I ’m focused on him . ”
73597	73606	73607	73607	she	1866	“ He ’s not going to come out , ”
73613	73631	73607	73607	she	1866	“ I saw his face . That chart . God , why did we leave it up ? ”
73632	73637	73638	73638	I	1493	“ And the darts , ”
73641	73659	73660	73660	she	1866	“ All this time he seemed like the kind of guy where everything rolls off his back , ”
73663	73696	73660	73660	she	1866	“ You look at his pictures . It ’s like nothing matters . But after what he confessed at The Wilder Club , it ’s really the opposite , is n’t it ? ”
73713	73728	73729	73729	I	1493	“ He did n’t create the Max Hilton persona because nothing matters to him , ”
73733	73742	73729	73729	I	1493	“ It ’s because things matter too much . ”
73788	73801	73784	73784	Kelsey	1866	“ You do n’t mind if I sit with you , right ? ”
73802	73810	73811	73811	I	1493	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
73849	73857	73858	73858	she	1866	“ Does he come out the front ? ”
73861	73871	73858	73858	she	1866	“ No , his car gets him below ground . ”
73872	73878	73879	73879	She	1866	“ But maybe not today . ”
73882	73910	73911	73911	She	1866	“ I ’m going to get a bagel over on the corner , and I ’ll take a really long time . But I ’ll be here . ”
74549	74558	74559	74559	Parker	1419	“ You want to me to leave you ? ”
74562	74569	74559	74559	Parker	1419	“ I know what it says . ”
74576	74588	74589	74589	I	1493	“ That smells amazing . Are you gon na eat it ? ”
74621	74632	74614	74614	He	1190	“ How long are you going to string this out ? ”
74633	74668	74614	74614	He	1190	“ I do n’t know . How long does a person sleep with somebody , and at home she has his picture full of darts ? And a wall - sized chart plotting vengeance ? ”
74669	74713	74714	74714	He	1190	“ Dude , you ’re talking to a guy who had a picture of Britney Spears wearing a snake on his wall well into his twenties . And it stopped being sexy when I was fifteen . People leave shit on their walls . ”
74719	74724	74725	74725	he	1190	“ Oh my god , ”
74755	74761	74762	74762	Parker	1419	“ It feels too late . ”
74781	74785	74786	74786	He	1419	“ You sure ? ”
74791	74873	74786	74786	He	1419	“ It was n’t just the fact of the picture and the chart , though that was bad enough . It was the shock of it after what I ’d told the group of them . I mean , I ’d just spilled my guts , right in front of her friends . About fucking pining over her . Loving her from afar . I laid it all out on the table — things I ’d never told a living soul . ”
74874	74882	74883	74883	he	1419	“ You got blindsided , no question , ”
74894	74978	74886	74886	I	1493	“ I could n’t believe what I was confessing to . It was like shoving a knife in my gut and bleeding out on stage . Right there in front of Mia and four complete strangers . But in a strange way , it felt good to bare my soul to them . I wanted them to see how I felt . And then the next thing I know , my face is covered in darts . Like I ’m Satan over there . ”
74979	74995	74886	74886	I	1493	“ I would ’ve felt blindsided , too . And I do n’t have issues . ”
74996	75002	75003	75003	I	1493	“ We all have issues , ”
75006	75018	75003	75003	I	1493	“ You ’re not good with vulnerability . How about that ? ”
75031	75058	75026	75026	Parker	1419	“ You ’re not . Have you heard a recording of the way you used to play piano ? Have you read the Hilton Playbook lately ? ”
75447	75466	75438	75438	Parker	1419	“ We got ta get over to the captain ’s table — the show ’s gon na start . ”
75694	75701	75702	75702	I	1493	“ So good to see you , ”
75834	75846	75847	75847	I	1493	“ I ’m sorry , that must ’ve been my leg , ”
75852	75858	75859	75859	she	243	“ What do you mean ? ”
75862	75869	75847	75847	I	1493	“ I think … our legs . ”
75870	75873	75874	75874	She	243	“ Oh ! ”
75892	75900	75901	75901	She	243	“ Smuckers ! What are you doing ? ”
75908	75919	75901	75901	She	243	“ I hope it ’s okay that he ’s here . ”
75920	75924	75925	75925	I	1493	“ Of course ! ”
75932	75943	75944	75944	she	243	“ We ’re raffling off his diamond bow tie collar , ”
75947	75966	75944	75944	she	243	“ He ’ll be modeling it later on . He ’s the spokes - dog for this charity . ”
75967	75972	75973	75973	I	1493	“ Spokes - dog , ”
75976	75981	75973	75973	I	1493	“ A vital role . ”
76166	76176	76160	76160	Sienna	92	“ Ca n’t I be the ‘ L ’ ? ”
76177	76185	76186	76186	Kelsey	1866	“ You ’re the ‘ Y , ’ ”
76189	76197	76198	76198	I	1493	“ The ‘ Y ’ is important . ”
76247	76258	76259	76259	I	1493	“ Flip over the squares when I give the signal , ”
76262	76265	76266	76266	Jada	1475	“ Breathe . ”
76274	76279	76280	76280	I	1493	“ You got this . ”
76286	76303	76280	76280	I	1493	“ What if he ’s just … annoyed ? There ’s a good chance of it . ”
76304	76315	76316	76316	Kelsey	1866	“ I promise you , he wo n’t be annoyed , ”
76319	76324	76316	76316	Kelsey	1866	“ Angry , then . ”
76325	76334	76335	76335	Kelsey	1866	“ You do n’t know until you try , ”
76338	76369	76335	76335	Kelsey	1866	“ You ’re scared right now , but you thought up this scheme when you were n’t scared . Your bravest self thought up this scheme . Trust that girl . ”
76370	76389	76390	76390	I	1493	“ That girl was n’t thinking about the downside . Max hating it . What have I done ? ”
76397	76409	76410	76410	I	1493	“ This could be the high school lunchroom all over again , ”
76413	76420	76421	76421	Jada	1475	“ We can still pull out , ”
76424	76427	76428	76428	Sienna	92	“ What ? ”
76431	76437	76428	76428	Sienna	92	“ Are you shitting me ? ”
76438	76444	76445	76445	Kelsey	1866	“ Nobody ’s pulling out . ”

76457	76468	76469	76469	I	1493	“ What if I created this just to punish myself ? ”
76474	76505	76469	76469	I	1493	“ Then I ’ll get you a year ’s supply of Peanut Butter Kandy Kakes . Okay ? And we ’ll dance it all off when we land Anything Goes . ”
76529	76538	76539	76539	I	1493	“ I seriously think I might throw up , ”

76670	76684	76685	76685	Vicky	243	“ Meow Squad made a huge last - minute donation to the shelter , ”
76688	76702	76685	76685	Vicky	243	“ Well , it makes sense . Meow Squad , cats , right ? ”
76764	76770	76750	76750	Her	1866	“ She hates that uniform , ”
