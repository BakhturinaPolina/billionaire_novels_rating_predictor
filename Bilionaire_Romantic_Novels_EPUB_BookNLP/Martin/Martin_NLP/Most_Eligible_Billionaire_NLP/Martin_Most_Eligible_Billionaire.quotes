3611	3635	3607	3607	She	394	“ It ’s painful for Smuckers to remember . Smuckers ’s twin brother died as a puppy . His name is Licky Lickardo . ”

Licky needs a friend so badly , and he ’s waiting for you on the other side . Just beyond the light . And he ’s just like Smuckers . You ’ll totally think it ’s Smuckers .

5420	5439	5415	5417	the security guy	404	“ You ’ll remove the animal or I ’ll remove it and hand it over to animal control . ”
5484	5493	5475	5475	He	404	“ Do you all understand who this is ? ”
5510	5524	5503	5505	The complaining nurse	432	“ I do n’t care . This is a pet - free facility . ”
5569	5607	5608	5608	I	2726	“ This is Bernadette Locke , head of the Locke Foundation , the entity that funded this wing , the medical teaching and research facility on the other side of that skyway , and probably your paychecks . ”
5634	5638	5639	5639	she	435	“ Henry Locke , ”

11432	11449	11419	11419	You	593	“ Can I just get that last part repeated ? Whatever came before the To Smuckers ? ”
11450	11456	11457	11457	Henry	77	“ You do n’t know ? ”
11464	11478	11457	11457	Henry	77	“ Are you sure you did n’t help Bernadette write the will herself ? ”
11489	11505	11479	11479	I	2726	“ I would never . I did n’t even know she was , you know … ”
11533	11546	11547	11547	He	77	“ Maybe Smuckers helped write it . Did Smuckers dictate the will ? ”
11559	11594	11595	11595	Henry	77	“ Look , when she asked me to care for Smuckers , she told me she ’d defray the costs of his special salon and vet . So if she left something for that … ”
11601	11618	11619	11619	I	2726	“ I ’d imagine control of a multibillion - dollar conglomerate would defray a few costs . ”
11631	11642	11619	11619	I	2726	“ People go to jail for this kind of thing , ”
11649	11658	11659	11660	the lawyer	578	“ Let ’s dial it back , Brett , ”
11663	11671	11672	11672	Brett	102	“ Why should I dial it back ? ”
11675	11683	11684	11684	Brett	102	“ I ’m not dialing back shit ! ”
11705	11718	11719	11719	I	2726	“ This was ... supposed to be about vet bills and things , ”
11764	11787	11759	11759	Henry	102	“ You ’re trying to steal the company my grandfather founded . How about not insulting our intelligence on top of that ? ”
11799	11817	11790	11792	the Locke women	600	“ A dog ca n’t control fifty - one percent of an international conglomerate , can he ? ”
11850	11858	11859	11860	the lawyer	578	“ With Ms. Nelson acting as regent ? ”
11863	11888	11859	11860	the lawyer	578	“ Yes , then it ’s no different than awarding control to an infant with a guardian acting in that infant ’s best interests . ”
12143	12155	12136	12136	Henry	77	“ Explains why you wanted custody of the dog so badly . ”
12156	12175	12176	12176	I	2726	“ I wanted custody because I gave my word to Bernadette , and Smuckers needed a nice home , ”
12179	12192	12193	12193	Henry	77	“ I really just expected money for fancy food and vet bills . ”
12199	12206	12193	12193	Henry	77	“ I ’m calling the police . ”
12207	12215	12258	12258	he	77	“ What ? What did I do ? ”
12216	12223	12224	12224	he	77	“ You defrauded a vulnerable individual , ”
12227	12238	12239	12239	He	77	“ You pretended you could read the dog ’s thoughts . ”
12248	12255	12239	12239	He	77	“ Harry Van Horn , please . ”
12353	12392	12347	12347	I	2726	“ Look , you guys . I ’m not here to take anybody to the cleaners . Honestly ? I came here because it was Bernadette ’s deepest wish that Smuckers maintain his same lifestyle after her death … ”
12393	12415	12416	12416	Brett	102	“ And that ’s all you want ? And you ’re willing to sign a piece of paper to that effect ? ”
12419	12428	12429	12430	the lawyer	578	“ Only Smuckers can designate a new heir , ”
12433	12441	12442	12442	Henry	102	“ The police are on their way , ”
12465	12478	12455	12455	I	2726	“ How about you have Smuckers designate a new heir , then ? ”
12488	12518	12479	12479	Brett	102	“ Then again , you ’d look okay in orange . Malcomb , what does the will say about Smuckers ’s regent reading his mind from a jail cell ? ”
12528	12540	12542	12542	Henry	102	“ Make her sign something … affidavit … criminal background check … ”
12614	12622	12623	12625	The main lawyer	624	“ Let ’s all take a breath . ”
12636	12659	12660	12660	Everyone	108	“ This is all getting a little close to duress for my comfort . A contract created under duress is n’t valid . ”
12665	12676	12677	12677	Malcomb	82	“ I am an officer of the court , Henry , ”
12680	12703	12704	12704	Henry	102	“ Yeah , you ’re an officer of the court who stood by while Mom was getting soaked by a scam artist , ”
12707	12719	12704	12704	Henry	102	“ That ’s the problem I ’m having here , Malcomb . ”
12720	12729	12730	12730	Malcomb	82	“ She was of sound mind , Henry , ”
12733	12740	12741	12741	Malcomb	82	“ It ’s what she wanted . ”
12795	12914	12789	12790	Lawyer Malcomb	109	“ In the decade prior to her death Bernadette assigned a longtime officer of the company , Kaleb Rowland , to cast the vote of her late husband ’s fifty - one percent along with his own twenty percent , with her son Henry acting as CEO . Kaleb and Henry have been excellent stewards of Locke Worldwide . Under their guidance , the firm has expanded enormously and created a massive amount of wealth . While we ’re working all of this out , I 'm going to suggest that Smuckers might see his way clear to allow Kaleb to retain his proxy while Henry continues on as operational CEO . You ’ll stay on , Kaleb ? ”
12998	13012	13013	13013	I	2726	“ Can you please explain the terms in a way I ’ll understand ? ”
13018	13026	13027	13027	Henry	102	“ Oh , for fuck ’s sake , ”
13030	13040	13041	13041	I	2726	“ Do we have to go through this charade ? ”
13046	13059	13041	13041	I	2726	“ Okay , I ’m getting a little tired of your attitude . ”
13087	13125	13075	13075	I	2726	“ Here ’s the situation — an old woman who felt utterly alone in life left things in her will to her dog . You want somebody to feel angry at ? Go look in a mirror . ”
13164	13174	13175	13175	he	102	“ You do n’t know anything about this family , ”
13179	13190	13175	13175	he	102	“ I know you ’re all … a bit unpleasant . ”
13749	13752	13753	13753	Brett	102	“ Grifter , ”
13775	13780	13781	13781	I	2726	“ We got this , ”
13834	13853	13854	13854	I	2726	“ Do n’t worry . She ’ll be crawling on her knees before this is over . Gratefully , ”
13891	13900	13901	13901	he	292	“ Girl could do a lot of damage , ”
13904	13911	13901	13901	he	292	“ Especially if she has people . ”
13912	13917	13918	13918	I	2726	“ We got this , ”
13922	13935	13918	13918	I	2726	“ The little scammer has no idea what she ’s stepped into . ”
13936	13944	13945	13945	he	292	“ You ca n’t contest the will , ”
13950	13955	13945	13945	he	292	“ Does n’t matter . ”
14642	14667	14668	14668	I	2726	“ … probably an extensive competency determination he and his estate people put Bernadette through before allowing this … enough not to get disbarred . ”
14702	14714	14679	14679	she	109	“ So . Not the straight line to control I envisioned . ”
14810	14816	14817	14817	Malcolmb	119	“ I ’ve prepared extracts , ”
14837	14889	14890	14890	She	297	“ Bernadette divided her assets three ways . Henry and Brett have inherited a number of properties and a share of liquid assets save what she distributed to the five second cousins . Smuckers ’s inheritance is listed here . He ’s in control of the family business , Ms. Nelson . ”
14898	14905	14890	14890	She	297	“ So all the cranes and … ”
14928	14943	14920	14920	she	297	“ She left Smuckers fifty - one percent of Lockeland Worldwide , Ms. Nelson , ”
14947	14960	14944	14944	Malcomb	109	“ It ’s a global corporation that includes a dozen distinct entities . ”
14961	14968	14969	14969	she	297	“ What does it mean though ? ”
15031	15041	15025	15025	He	102	“ These are the companies under Smuckers ’s control . ”
15197	15278	15192	15192	she	701	“ It means , if Smuckers wants to , he would take his place on the board with your assistance . He would attend meetings and vote on things , and his vote would decide issues , mostly around the overall direction of the company . As CEO , Henry runs the day - to - day stuff . But as a board member and owner , Smuckers would provide the vision and direction , while drawing a monthly stipend . ”
15290	15317	15285	15285	Brett	102	“ If the dog dies under suspicious circumstances , the shares go to the Humane Society . Natural life for that dog is ten more years . ”
15318	15321	15322	15322	I	2726	“ What ? ”
15325	15334	15322	15322	I	2726	“ You were thinking about killing the dog ? ”
15335	15338	15339	15339	he	2726	“ Dude , ”
15342	15350	15339	15339	he	2726	“ Got ta explore our options here . ”
15351	15359	15360	15360	He	2726	“ We ’re not killing the dog . ”
15371	15378	15379	15379	he	2726	“ It wo n’t help anyway , ”
15382	15407	15408	15408	Brett	102	“ We have to pay her off . How much ? What do you think ? Smuckers can choose to hand over those shares . ”
15439	15459	15434	15434	I	2726	“ This is just a business problem with a business solution . We ’ve had disasters before , right ? ”
15514	15521	15522	15522	Kaleb	292	“ Do n’t start too low , ”
15533	15538	15539	15539	I	2726	“ Three million cash , ”
15579	15590	15591	15591	I	2726	“ Three million , and we do n’t press charges , ”
15594	15610	15611	15611	She	706	“ If she did any kind of research , she ’d know — you know . ”
15659	15667	15668	15668	Brett	102	“ At least offer four point five , ”
15671	15691	15668	15668	Brett	102	“ It feels like five . She ’ll go to ten , then , and we meet at seven . ”
15692	15701	15702	15702	Kaleb	292	“ It ’s a good payday for her , ”
15705	15716	15702	15702	Kaleb	292	“ Assuming she ’s not part of an organized team . ”
15717	15725	15726	15726	I	2726	“ I do n’t think she is , ”
15729	15735	15736	15736	Kaleb	292	“ How do you know ? ”
15791	15823	15824	15824	I	2726	“ Because she ’d use them to squeeze us . She ’d come in like a tiger with some boiler - room financial guy or a shady lawyer . Not like … ”
15829	15832	15824	15824	I	2726	“ Please . ”
15833	15836	15837	15837	Kaleb	292	“ Right , ”
15926	15931	15932	15932	She	713	“ Let ’s talk . ”
15937	15940	15932	15932	She	713	“ Okay . ”
15941	15966	15967	15967	She	713	“ We ’ve called the police . They do n’t have enough to make anything stick — yet — but they ’ll have questions . ”
15970	15978	15967	15967	She	713	“ But I did n’t do anything ! ”
16005	16027	16033	16033	her	713	“ We ’ll let them decide that . I do n’t imagine they have enough to make anything stick — yet . ”
16057	16066	16067	16067	I	2726	“ I have to pick up my sister . ”
16070	16088	16067	16067	I	2726	“ Maybe you should ’ve thought of that before you decided to defraud a vulnerable old woman . ”
16089	16095	16053	16053	She	713	“ I did n’t defraud — ”
16096	16114	16115	16115	She	713	“ It ’s just us here , jelly bean , so you can stop with the pretense . ”
16126	16193	16194	16194	She	713	“ The good news is that I ’m prepared to hand over a cashier ’s check this afternoon to get clear of all this . Malcolmb and his team will draw up papers and you ’ll sign over the ownership . You can probably get more cash out eventually , yeah , but it would take years , and I think we both know the risks . ”
16274	16286	16287	16287	he	102	“ It ’s a good deal , and we walk away , ”
16298	16311	16312	16312	She	713	“ This is a good deal . Let ’s resolve it now . ”
16324	16330	16331	16331	she	713	“ Four point five million ? ”
16436	16445	16446	16446	I	2726	“ Here ’s the thing , Ms. Nelson , ”
16449	16487	16446	16446	I	2726	“ It ’s the four point five million , plus we do n’t use the very considerable resources we have to destroy your life and quite possibly ensure that you end up rotting in a prison cell . ”
16542	16601	16602	16602	I	2726	“ I do n’t know if you ’re working with people , but if you are , they ca n’t protect you . And they wo n’t go down for this . You know who goes down for this ? You . You go down , and you go down very hard . Very publicly . Very painfully . ”
16606	16613	16614	16614	She	713	“ And you will stay down . ”
16637	16658	16634	16634	I	2726	“ What , did they get you from central casting ? Do n’t bother staying in character on my account . ”
16673	16679	16668	16668	she	713	“ I 'm not acting . ”
16698	16747	16748	16748	She	713	“ Of course you ’re not . My advice is you take the money I ’m offering in the next ten minutes . Because ten minutes is about how long you have , given rush hour traffic for our good friends on the police force to get here . ”
16818	16824	16825	16825	I	2726	“ Everyone has a price , ”
16828	16832	16825	16825	I	2726	“ Especially you . ”
16849	16859	16839	16839	her	713	“ I told you I ’m not a scammer . ”
16880	16885	16871	16871	My	2726	“ Take the money , ”
16889	16897	16886	16886	I	2726	“ or I will fucking bury you . ”
16956	16961	16962	16962	Brett	102	“ That a no ? ”
16971	16980	16981	16981	I	2726	“ The offer goes poof in two minutes , ”
16984	16989	16990	16990	Brett	102	“ Now or never . ”
17025	17038	17039	17039	She	713	“ You do n’t want to feel our power turned against you . ”
17042	17052	17053	17053	Her	713	“ Well here ’s the thing , Henry Locke . ”
17069	17077	17058	17058	she	713	“ It ’s not up to me . ”
17203	17212	17197	17197	I	2726	“ Who ’s it up to , then ? ”
17230	17236	17237	17237	She	713	“ Who do you think ? ”
17262	17279	17255	17255	She	713	“ It ’s up to Smuckers , of course ! Have you not been paying attention ? ”
17311	17360	17361	17361	I	2726	“ What do you prefer , Smuckers ? Would you like Henry Locke to write us a check for four point five million dollars ? Or would you prefer to take your place alongside him as a visionary member and major shareholder on the board of Locke Worldwide ? ”
17372	17377	17378	17378	she	713	“ Smuckers , concentrate , ”
17388	17413	17378	17378	she	713	“ Do you want some money now ? Or to vote on pressing issues while drawing a monthly stipend of seventy - five thousand ? ”
17453	17470	17471	17471	she	713	“ You have to decide , you just have to . Do it for Jelly Bean , ”
17488	17502	17479	17479	Smuckers	1007	“ That ’s right , boy ! That ’s right ! You decide ! ”
17503	17510	17511	17511	I	2726	“ Oh , come off it , ”
17534	17538	17539	17539	She	713	“ You mind ? ”
17545	17575	17539	17539	She	713	“ What do you think , Smuckers ? Think hard , because they wo n’t offer again . It ’s an ultimatum . Do you know what that is ? ”
17607	17630	17631	17631	She	713	“ Really ? That ’s your answer ? Are you sure ? I know , he ’s a bit of a bastard . ”
17636	17670	17631	17631	She	713	“ Smuckers has decided he would prefer to take his seat on the board . As a voting shareholder , with me as his assistant , to interpret his wishes regarding Locke Worldwide . ”
17924	17926	17913	17913	Mom	297	“ before ”

20954	20962	20951	20951	he	77	“ And Smuckers . Right on time . ”
20963	20970	20951	20951	he	77	“ Looks like you already started . ”
20971	20978	20979	20979	He	77	“ Would we start without you ? ”
20994	20999	21000	21000	I	2726	“ Um … yes ? ”
21003	21010	21011	21011	Brett	102	“ That was n’t a meeting , ”
21026	21034	21035	21035	Henry	102	“ We ’ll be back in ten . ”
21069	21075	21076	21076	I	2726	“ You ’re an owner . ”
21086	21094	21095	21095	I	2726	“ Well , technically it ’s Smuckers , ”
21108	21132	21098	21098	She	866	“ You might ask for a full description of board privileges . Did you know we send cars to pick up all members ? ”
21133	21136	21098	21098	She	866	“ No . ”
21137	21190	21191	21191	I	2726	“ There ’s a credit card attached to board membership that you can spend on meeting - related stuff . A projector , for example . Or a new case for the dog . Anything utilized in a board meeting would be reimbursed . You really do n’t know any of this ? ”
21196	21204	21191	21191	I	2726	“ Have you sat on a board ? ”
21205	21208	21209	21209	I	2726	“ No , ”
21212	21237	21209	21209	I	2726	“ You ’ll like it here . Locke Worldwide is like family . Doing the right thing really is the right thing around here . ”
21354	21364	21365	21365	I	2726	“ I ’ve never sat on a board before , ”
21368	21404	21405	21405	Henry	102	“ So I ’m wondering , before we start , if there are things I should know . The lay of the land . Maybe , you know , some sort of greetings wagon thingy ? ”
21429	21435	21417	21417	his	102	“ A greetings wagon thingy ? ”
21436	21479	21417	21417	his	102	“ You know , that bag neighbors hang on the doorknob to welcome somebody who just moved in to the neighborhood , and it explains things they should know about neighborhood amenities , like playgrounds , and there are pizza coupons and — ”
21480	21488	21417	21417	his	102	“ I know what greetings wagon means . ”
21489	21500	21501	21501	He	102	“ Smuckers is a bit new at all of this . ”
21512	21520	21521	21521	she	870	“ I ’ll set up a courier , ”
21690	21724	21671	21671	Henry	102	“ … the balance sheet is figure two in your packet . We ’re unhappy with an underperforming pension fund investment . Are you going to vote with us to make it right ? ”
21725	21729	21730	21730	I	2726	“ Smuckers concurs , ”
22038	22041	22042	22042	Henry	102	“ Vicky ? ”
22049	22056	22042	22042	Henry	102	“ Does Smuckers have a vote ? ”
22057	22063	22064	22064	I	2726	“ Smuckers is with you , ”
22067	22074	22064	22064	I	2726	“ On this one , anyway . ”
22885	22890	22880	22880	she	297	“ All in favor , ”
23179	23184	23185	23185	I	2726	“ All in favor , ”
23267	23270	23262	23262	I	2726	“ Aye . ”
23301	23313	23314	23314	I	2726	“ Wait , I do n’t even know what this is . ”
23321	23332	23333	23333	She	297	“ All present in favor . Just waiting on you . ”
23342	23355	23356	23356	Vicky	297	“ Can I get a definition of reallocation of plebiscite by seniority ? ”
23363	23372	23356	23356	Vicky	297	“ What is this , a spelling bee ? ”
23373	23381	23333	23333	She	297	“ I just do n’t understand it . ”
23382	23416	23417	23417	She	297	“ It ’s a procedural motion to ensure continuing smooth operation . An agreement on forms of agreement . You ’re going to have to get used to voting on matters of procedure . ”
23423	23429	23430	23430	she	297	“ Specific definition , please , ”
23437	23442	23443	23443	I	2726	“ It ’s procedural , ”
23456	23462	23463	23463	She	297	“ A matter of continuation . ”
23507	23512	23500	23500	She	297	“ Reallocation of plebiscite ? ”
23525	23533	23518	23518	She	297	“ The rule gives precedence to experience . ”
23534	23539	23518	23518	She	297	“ What ’s plebiscite ? ”
23540	23543	23544	23544	Her	297	“ Ballot . ”
23573	23584	23585	23585	She	297	“ Precedence to experience . As opposed to a … ? ”
23622	23632	23633	23633	she	297	“ Maybe as opposed to a fluffy little dog ? ”
23637	23647	23633	23633	she	297	“ Not how I was going to put it . ”
23648	23653	23654	23654	She	297	“ Well , then . ”
23659	23674	23675	23675	She	297	“ Smuckers has considered your amendment , and he ’s decided to vote no . ”
23680	23695	23696	23696	She	297	“ What is that , boy ? Oh , I ’m sorry , nay . ”
23702	23722	23696	23696	She	297	“ I ca n’t believe you tried to strip him of his vote . Do you have no decency ? ”
23723	23734	23735	23735	Her	297	“ When it comes to protecting this company ? No . ”
23739	23743	23735	23735	Her	297	“ Just no ? ”
23744	23749	23750	23750	I	2726	“ None at all , ”
23753	23764	23750	23750	I	2726	“ No decency whatsoever . Nada , if you will . ”
23817	23820	23821	23821	she	297	“ Uh , ”
23824	23836	23821	23821	she	297	“ You think you ’re all that ? You ’re not . ”
23837	23843	23844	23844	I	2726	“ Oh , I am , ”
23847	23866	23844	23844	I	2726	“ I very much am . And for the record , I will crush you in the end . ”
23867	23874	23875	23875	she	297	“ Smuckers had this medication once , ”
23878	23906	23907	23907	She	297	“ We tried to hide it in his food , and he spit it out . No matter what we did , he ’d spit it out . ”
23929	23948	23907	23907	She	297	“ Smuckers does n’t like when people try to fool him . That ’s his message for you . ”
23949	23957	23958	23958	I	2726	“ I have a message for Smuckers . ”
23972	24003	24005	24005	she	297	“ Smuckers needs to know that we have a private investigator on this case . Smuckers might not have very nice food to eat if you ended up in prison . ”
24013	24048	24049	24049	He	102	“ I think we can all walk away from this table happy . Maybe Henry was hasty with that ultimatum . I say we settle this . One - time offer from me personally . ”
24054	24062	24049	24049	He	102	“ This offer expires in two minutes . ”
24155	24162	24163	24163	Brett	102	“ This is our last offer , ”
24166	24184	24185	24185	She	297	“ After this , we ’ll take the company from you , and you ’ll get nothing . ”
24209	24221	24222	24222	she	297	“ You know what Smuckers hates even more than being fooled ? ”
24248	24254	24255	24255	she	297	“ He hates being threatened , ”
24258	24269	24255	24255	she	297	“ And bullied . He really , really hates it . ”
24270	24283	24284	24284	I	2726	“ Well he ’s going to have to get used to it , ”
24289	24334	24284	24284	I	2726	“ He ’s used to bubbles and bows and sunny parks but he ’s in the jungle now . There are animals here who are faster and stronger and smarter than he is . Animals who will dominate him easily . Savagely , even . ”
24335	24345	24373	24373	I	2726	“ Then you do n’t know Smuckers very well . ”
24346	24372	24373	24373	I	2726	“ Oh , I know all about Smuckers , and I ’d suggest he practice rolling over . Baring his belly for the superior predator . ”
24378	24384	24373	24373	I	2726	“ Begging sweetly for mercy . ”
24406	24438	24402	24402	I	2726	“ Smuckers may think he can request packets and bylaws and definitions and get up to speed , but he ca n’t compete here . He does n’t have the skills . ”
24439	24454	24455	24455	she	920	“ Smuckers thinks owning fifty - one percent is the best skill to have , ”
24462	24471	24472	24472	Kaleb	292	“ Then Smuckers should prepare to be destroyed . ”
24477	24492	24472	24472	Kaleb	292	“ I think this meeting has devolved to the point where we can adjourn . ”
24493	24502	24503	24503	I	2726	“ We still have issues to take up , ”
24506	24510	24511	24511	She	920	“ More plebiscites ? ”
24519	24534	24511	24511	She	920	“ No , thanks . Though I do have one request . An assistant . ”
24564	24581	24551	24551	She	920	“ Do you have an assistant in mind ? You can bring in anybody you want . ”
24582	24598	24599	24599	She	920	“ I ’d like somebody familiar with the company and the board . Maybe April ? ”
24611	24616	24617	24617	I	2726	“ If April agrees . ”
24645	24670	24671	24671	April	127	“ You can take her to HR and hash it out . Try it on a thirty - day trial basis if you like . ”
24710	24715	24716	24716	I	2726	“ We got this , ”
24747	24750	24751	24751	I	2726	“ What ? ”
24754	24765	24751	24751	I	2726	“ Are you looking to fight her or fuck her ? ”
25569	25574	25575	25575	I	2726	“ It was amazing , ”
25578	25583	25575	25575	I	2726	“ They were nice ? ”
25584	25623	25624	25624	I	2726	“ Complete assholes . Especially Henry , the leader of the pack . One of the biggest jackasses I ever met . He tried to fool me into voting against my own wishes , but I did n’t . ”
25682	25689	25690	25690	I	2726	“ Uh ! Such a jerk ! ”
25693	25702	25690	25690	I	2726	“ But you did n’t vote against yourself ? ”
25703	25707	25708	25708	I	2726	“ Hell no . ”
25724	25752	25715	25715	I	2726	“ When people come at you , you have to stand up for yourself . Nobody will fight for you quite like you will fight for you . ”
26092	26096	26097	26097	she	137	“ Sad face , ”
26100	26110	26097	26097	she	137	“ I brought cookies and everybody ate them all . ”
26127	26131	26123	26123	she	137	“ The baby ! ”
26235	26238	26239	26239	she	137	“ What ? ”
26249	26257	26258	26258	I	2726	“ I have a commission for you , ”
26261	26283	26258	26258	I	2726	“ It ’s something a little offbeat . A beautiful piece of furniture . But I need it in a week . ”
26284	26290	26291	26291	She	137	“ You ’re hiring me . ”
26300	26314	26291	26291	She	137	“ You know I ’m not cheap . Especially for a rush job . ”
26315	26333	26334	26334	I	2726	“ I do n’t expect this to be cheap . In fact , cost is no object . ”
26342	26415	26334	26334	I	2726	“ I want a really special piece of furniture for Smuckers . I ’m imagining a cross between a dog bed and a throne . And it ca n’t be plain . I want flourishes . Scrollwork . Metal . Jewels . Whatever . Just make it wildly outrageous . Maybe four feet high or so . I want him to be really comfortable , but regal , elevated above everybody else . ”
26416	26447	26481	26481	She	973	“ I think you ’re taking this new dog mom gig a little seriously . You can put a bowl on the floor and he ’ll be just as happy . ”
26448	26480	26481	26481	She	973	“ It ’s not for my house — it’s … a long story . Trust me , I want a dog throne , the most elaborate thing you can possibly make . ”
26543	26561	26529	26529	She	973	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re in charge of Cock Worldwide . They sound like asshats ! ”
26562	26569	26570	26570	I	2726	“ You do n’t even know . ”
26598	26606	26607	26607	She	973	“ A dog throne , you say . ”
26648	26669	26634	26634	She	973	“ I ’m seeing it the size of a coffee saucer . Like a coat of arms , except not . ”
26674	26681	26670	26670	I	2726	“ It needs to be enamel ! ”
26725	26731	26732	26732	she	973	“ I freaking love that , ”
26735	26743	26732	26732	she	973	“ What are you setting it in ? ”
26762	26780	26759	26760	Henry Hate	140	“ Pink alloy . Neon pink alloy . This huge Smuckers face medallion set in neon pink . ”
26781	26785	26755	26755	WWHH	139	“ Like candy . ”
26786	26790	26793	26793	I	2726	“ Like candy . ”
27106	27119	27100	27100	one	991	“ Are you going to put Smuckers ’s name on the medallion ? ”
27120	27136	27137	27137	I	2726	“ That ’s what I was thinking , but it might not be fun enough , ”
27148	27155	27156	27156	Latrisha	137	“ I love that too much , ”
27160	27191	27156	27156	Latrisha	137	“ With his little sweet face ? It ’s like it means kiss you or fuck you or love you or hate you . What are you going to wear ? ”
27192	27198	27100	27100	one	991	“ What do you mean ? ”
27199	27228	27100	27100	one	991	“ You ’re part of Smuckers ’s entourage . Sort of like , the organ grinder and the monkey — they both get the little vests , right ? ”
27229	27241	27242	27242	I	2726	“ I hope I ’m the organ grinder in this scenario , ”
27245	27256	27242	27242	I	2726	“ Oh , def . Henry can be the monkey . ”
27257	27280	27100	27100	one	991	“ An entourage . I did n’t think of that . Or what I ’m going to wear , jewelry - wise . ”
27281	27317	27242	27242	I	2726	“ Girl , you ’re a jewelry maker and you did n’t think of the accessorizing component to all this ? It needs to be just as fun as what we ’re doing for Smuckers . ”
27439	27444	27434	27434	I	2726	“ Two . Booth . ”
27523	27527	27528	27528	He	102	“ This way . ”
27552	27560	27561	27561	I	2726	“ It ’s mood alteration o’clock somewhere , ”
27564	27572	27573	27573	He	102	“ The second one ’s for you . ”
27585	27600	27601	27601	I	2726	“ The good news is that they found the loophole you thought they would . ”
27616	27625	27607	27608	our lawyers	1000	“ qualified to serve as permitted by state law ”
27635	27648	27607	27608	our lawyers	1000	“ And something like this would fall under private mediation , right ? ”
27649	27656	27657	27657	Our	999	“ That ’s what they say . ”
27661	27690	27691	27691	He	102	“ Should n’t be hard to prove , considering half a dozen people have witnessed her channeling the thoughts of a dog . Where ’s the bad news ? ”
27699	27718	27691	27691	He	102	“ They have to file , then get on the schedule . It ’s going to be slow . ”
27719	27726	27607	27608	our lawyers	1000	“ So we grease some wheels . ”
27727	27758	27691	27691	He	102	“ We ca n’t pay to speed it up . It has to go by the book . We got ta do this Boy Scout or it might get challenged . ”
27759	27763	27691	27691	He	102	“ How long ? ”
27764	27772	27773	27773	he	102	“ Weeks . I do n’t know , ”
27776	27782	27783	27783	I	2726	“ They do n’t know . ”
27879	27885	27891	27891	me	2726	“ So we manage her . ”
27940	27965	27966	27966	I	2726	“ Never imagined I ’d feel nostalgic for Kaleb ’s minimum profit - per - square - foot ball and chain around my ankle , ”
27972	27979	27969	27969	He	102	“ What the hell ! Right ? ”
28058	28079	28048	28049	The man	1007	“ Manage her . Keep her busy . Keep her from screwing things up . Keep her … favorably disposed . ”
28080	28093	28094	28094	Brett	102	“ Should be easy for you . She ’s not with anyone , ”
28118	28155	28115	28115	Brett	102	“ So you can play good cop and I ’ll play bad cop . I ’ll gather evidence and work the lawyers and keep the PI digging , and you just keep her on her back . ”
28174	28212	28213	28213	I	2726	“ You ’re into it , right ? One of New York ’s ten most eligible bachelors ? You could do a very good good cop . You could keep her sated until we yank the firm . ”
28255	28264	28265	28265	Brett	102	“ Get her into the Henry fan club , ”
28268	28286	28265	28265	Brett	102	“ Take her out . Charm her . Romantic picnics in the park . Billionaire helicopter rides . ”
28349	28362	28333	28333	her	1012	“ No , that approach — it ’s not right for her . ”
28363	28373	28333	28333	her	1012	“ What , are you suddenly a grifter expert ? ”
28374	28401	28333	28333	her	1012	“ It ’s too generic for her . The picnic thing and all that , it says , Look at me , I ’m romancing you . ”
28402	28408	28333	28333	her	1012	“ Kind of the point . ”
28409	28417	28418	28418	I	2726	“ Vicky wo n’t go for it , ”
28428	28447	28418	28418	I	2726	“ This is n’t a woman who wants a heart - shaped box of chocolates . She ’s — ”
28478	28506	28472	28472	I	2726	“ I ’ll handle her , do n’t worry . She ca n’t give messed - up orders if she ’s got a cock in her mouth . ”
28507	28515	28516	28516	Brett	102	“ There ’s the good cop spirit , ”
28519	28564	28516	28516	Brett	102	“ Now , what about the press ? What if they find out that Smuckers is heading up the board ? That little bit of news could screw up a lot of projects . The stadium ? They want an excuse to say no . ”
28565	28576	28472	28472	I	2726	“ I wo n’t let anything nix the stadium deal . ”
28577	28590	28591	28591	I	2726	“ Well , they ’re looking for an excuse to say no . ”
28639	28651	28652	28652	He	102	“ We go public with the dog thing . Full disclosure . ”
28657	28663	28652	28652	He	102	“ Not entirely tracking here . ”
28664	28727	28652	28652	He	102	“ What Mom did is so hosed up , who would believe it ? So we make it look like a charity stunt . Oh , no ! Bernadette willed her empire to the dogs . Look ! The damn dog is in control and giving money to dog charities . Oh , no ! Wink - wink - nudge - nudge . ”
28736	28745	28652	28652	He	102	“ Like it ’s just a PR stunt . ”
28746	28764	28765	28765	I	2726	“ Exactly . What mother would leave a company to the dog and not her CEO son ? ”
28773	28809	28765	28765	I	2726	“ We write an over - the - top press release . We give a big cardboard check to some dog pound . And guess who gets to be in charge of choosing the charity ? ”
28854	28860	28861	28861	Carly	470	“ Everything ’s good now , ”
28870	28873	28861	28861	Carly	470	“ Def , ”
29492	29501	29502	29502	she	470	“ You ’re really committing to the madness , ”
29529	29540	29521	29521	She	470	“ I kind of want one . Exactly like this . ”
29673	29679	29680	29684	a woman in mod stripes	470	“ This is completely different , ”
29700	29706	29687	29687	She	470	“ You ca n’t switch . ”
29707	29730	29731	29731	I	2726	“ The old stuff was about women hiding their true personalities , and that ’s not what I ’m interested in anymore , ”
29734	29740	29731	29731	I	2726	“ Jewelry should express something . ”
29810	29831	29799	29799	He	470	“ We worked up a whole new biz - casual strategy for the other , and that ’s not this . ”
29832	29842	29843	29844	the woman	470	“ We had this designated for a specific niche , ”
29859	29867	29853	29853	They	1037	“ We might have to postpone this , ”
29875	29892	29868	29872	the blue - haired buyer	1036	“ This is n’t the collection we were slotting . This new one … no offense . ”
29898	29916	29868	29872	the blue - haired buyer	1036	“ Usually when somebody says no offense , there is some . This I got ta see . ”
29917	29926	29927	29927	I	2726	“ I brought one that was n’t requested , ”
29940	29954	29955	29955	She	470	“ I was n’t thinking . I ’ll go back through the channels . ”
29996	29999	30000	30000	she	470	“ Hmm , ”
30045	30052	30040	30040	I	2726	“ What do you call it ? ”
30053	30057	30058	30058	I	2726	“ Smuck U , ”
30072	30080	30081	30081	She	470	“ Inspired by my dog , Smuckers . ”
30086	30092	30081	30081	She	470	“ What ’s the thinking ? ”
30121	30162	30115	30115	I	2726	“ People have tried to push Smuckers around . Take things away from him . Smuckers wears bow ties , and he ’s cute and fluffy , but he is so done with people pushing him around . So done . ”
30170	30188	30163	30163	Everyone	360	“ Cuff bracelet . All metal is a pink alloy . This is what you wear when … ”
30202	30231	30189	30189	I	2726	“ Well , it ’s what you wear whenever you feel like it . It ’s high - end , but not playing the high - end game . ”
30280	30316	30278	30279	Smuck U.	84	“ It ’s not about what the world tells you to be . It ’s about what makes you feel alive . This is for a woman who ’s so done with being pushed around . ”
30344	30369	30370	30370	I	2726	“ I like it , but it does n’t work for us , and especially not … it ’s not what we had slotted . ”
30494	30508	30485	30485	Brett	102	“ Somebody did n’t read the bylaws as well as she should ’ve . ”
30566	30572	30573	30573	I	2726	“ Let ’s do this . ”
30973	30978	30979	30979	Brett	102	“ What the hell ? ”
31185	31190	31191	31191	I	2726	“ What is this ? ”
31215	31228	31229	31229	she	297	“ Provisions and accommodations shall be made for board members attending meetings , ”
31251	31256	31246	31246	Kaleb	292	“ This is irregular . ”
31257	31262	31263	31263	Brett	102	“ It ’s ridiculous , ”
31267	31273	31263	31263	Brett	102	“ Mimes are n’t accommodations . ”
31416	31431	31408	31408	Brett	102	“ The hell ? Tell me that ’s not a throne for the dog . ”
31432	31435	31436	31436	I	2726	“ Okay , ”
31439	31450	31436	31436	I	2726	“ How about an elevated , highly decorated dog bed ? ”
31451	31455	31408	31408	Brett	102	“ Not funny . ”
31510	31513	31514	31514	I	2726	“ Seriously ? ”
31531	31538	31522	31522	I	2726	“ You want to explain this ? ”
31539	31547	31548	31548	she	297	“ Is n’t it self - explanatory ? ”
31551	31606	31548	31548	she	297	“ Smuckers needs a place to sit , too . I mean , does it seem fair to you that every board member here has their own seat except Smuckers ? Who ever heard of an individual who sits on the board of a major corporation having to sit on another person ’s lap ? ”
31625	31630	31631	31631	I	2726	“ A bit redundant , ”
31634	31644	31631	31631	I	2726	“ His portrait , when he ’s right here . ”
31645	31669	31670	31670	she	297	“ Smuckers likes people to know who ’s in charge . Especially since there was some confusion about it at the last meeting , ”
31787	31793	31794	31794	Her	297	“ Do you like it ? ”
31926	31932	31933	31933	she	297	“ Pretty nice , huh ? ”
31961	31978	31979	31979	I	2726	“ It ’s as good a thing as any to wear while I take you down , ”
31982	31993	31979	31979	I	2726	“ You think you can take me and Smuckers down ? ”
32004	32015	31979	31979	I	2726	“ ’Cause in that badass throne ? Look at him ! ”
32035	32042	32030	32030	Mandy	131	“ Should we get to it ? ”
32060	32064	32065	32065	She	131	“ Thank you . ”
32083	32105	32106	32106	he	292	“ I did n’t dedicate my life to Locke Worldwide for a dog on a throne to preside in the boardroom , ”
32123	32135	32117	32117	I	2726	“ Is Smuckers ready to proceed with the week ’s business ? ”
32136	32141	32142	32142	she	131	“ Very much so , ”
32203	32206	32207	32207	Vicky	297	“ Wait , ”
32380	32386	32375	32375	Vicky	297	“ What do you think ? ”
32387	32399	32400	32400	I	2726	“ Smuckers ’s share of the company will increase with this , ”
32403	32413	32414	32414	She	131	“ This makes Smuckers richer while delivering better service . ”
32417	32420	32421	32421	I	2726	“ What ? ”
32424	32445	32446	32446	I	2726	“ Smuckers does n’t like the idea of new software . The learning curve — he ’s not into it . ”
32449	32469	32470	32470	She	131	“ If we wanted to stay away from learning curves we ’d still be adding and subtracting on abacuses . ”
32473	32493	32494	32494	She	131	“ You ’re preaching to the choir , dude . I ’m not the one to be convinced here . ”
32505	32513	32514	32514	I	2726	“ Smuckers can hear me just fine , ”
32543	32567	32540	32540	Vicky	297	“ Smuckers does n’t like how you ’re talking to me when he ’s the one making the decisions . He feels alienated . ”
32568	32572	32573	32573	I	2726	“ Does he , ”
32576	32586	32587	32587	she	131	“ You should make your arguments directly to Smuckers , ”
32590	32606	32587	32587	she	131	“ If you want him on your side you need to work a little harder . ”
32607	32618	32619	32619	She	131	“ We ’re not going to do that , Vicky . ”
32627	32643	32619	32619	She	131	“ Smuckers is n’t feeling favorable to the funding , that ’s the problem here . ”
32644	32650	32651	32651	Kaleb	292	“ We need this funding , ”
32654	32665	32666	32666	She	131	“ We could lose millions of dollars of business here . ”
32669	32748	32749	32749	Smuckers	1007	“ Then I ’d suggest you tell Smuckers directly why he should cast a yes vote . Really talk to him . Make him feel included . Because , between you all and me and the Locke Worldwide flagpoles , you ’re not treating him with the respect he feels is his due . You tried to defraud him in the last meeting , and now you ’re ignoring him . Can you blame him for being unhappy ? ”
32872	32879	32880	32880	Mandy	131	“ Dreoger starts on the fifteenth , ”
32895	32898	32892	32892	I	2726	“ Right . ”
32909	32914	32915	32915	Vicky	297	“ That right there , ”
32918	32936	32915	32915	Vicky	297	“ When you talk like that without giving Smuckers any kind of background , he feels unhappy . ”
33019	33022	33023	33023	I	2726	“ Smuckers , ”
33026	33061	33023	33023	I	2726	“ if we were to convert over to this new software , it ’ll result in a tighter integration of our core services . And honestly , nobody is worried about the learning curve . ”
33062	33072	33073	33073	Kaleb	292	“ Project teams have been researching it … Smuckers , ”
33076	33083	33084	33084	she	1083	“ That ’s not very persuasive , ”
33087	33092	33093	33093	I	2726	“ Look , Smuckers , ”
33101	33169	33093	33093	I	2726	“ We really need your vote on this . I know what you ’re thinking , that a services integration will result in higher initial bid costs , so yeah , our bids might not look competitive , but this up - front integration will cut out surprises . Construction and design would work together , instead of a design being handed over to construction to interpret . ”
33176	33186	33187	33187	I	2726	“ Can you imagine how much time that wastes ? ”
33321	33355	33309	33309	Smuckers	1007	“ When everyone collaborates at the front , Smuckers , projects run shorter , with fewer surprises . That ’s more valuable than lower up - front costs , do n’t you agree ? ”
33400	33411	33397	33397	I	2726	“ The tighter integration of business units will be incredible . ”
33419	33425	33397	33397	I	2726	“ Is that a yes ? ”
33484	33490	33472	33472	I	2726	“ Who ’s your daddy ? ”
33491	33494	33495	33495	Vicky	297	“ Uh ! ”
33504	33508	33495	33495	Vicky	297	“ Not you ! ”
33656	33664	33665	33665	I	2726	“ What ’s that ? Okay then . ”
33668	33695	33665	33665	I	2726	“ While Smuckers appreciates your effort , Mr. Locke , you really just did n’t do it for him in the end . Smuckers votes no . ”
33696	33702	33703	33703	Mandy	131	“ You ’re voting no ? ”
33738	33743	33744	33744	I	2726	“ Smuckers votes no , ”
33756	33768	33769	33769	Mandy	131	“ Smuckers did n’t find the argument compelling . At all . ”
33816	33824	33825	33825	Mandy	131	“ Can you articulate an actual reason ? ”
33833	33841	33825	33825	Mandy	131	“ Other than your being a jerk ? ”
33842	33849	33850	33850	Henry	102	“ Let ’s dial it back , ”
34194	34199	34200	34200	I	2726	“ I ’m sorry , ”
34203	34250	34251	34251	Mandy	131	“ I can see why you ’d be mad after being bullied and tricked . Or being threatened if you do n’t take a payout . Or being unfairly brought to the police station … oh wait — that ’s what you guys did to me . ”
34254	34264	34265	34265	Henry	102	“ This is impossible . This is not okay . ”
34271	34282	34265	34265	Henry	102	“ It ’s a business problem with a business solution . ”
34338	34345	34346	34346	he	102	“ We ’ll revisit this thing , ”
34379	34383	34384	34384	Henry	102	“ Hold on , ”
34387	34396	34384	34384	Henry	102	“ We have something else on the table . ”
34415	34418	34406	34406	I	2726	“ What ? ”
34419	34429	34430	34430	he	102	“ We do charitable giving through the Locke Foundation , ”
34433	34480	34481	34481	I	2726	“ I ca n’t remember the last time we gave to an animal charity . With Smuckers on the board now , I think it might be a nice gesture for the foundation to fund up a needy local rescue or shelter . A substantial gift . ”
34501	34505	34506	34506	Brett	102	“ Love it , ”
34509	34529	34506	34506	Brett	102	“ People are going to hear about Smuckers soon enough . Let ’s make it a fun news story . ”
34530	34533	34534	34534	Henry	102	“ Right ? ”
34539	34559	34534	34534	Henry	102	“ You would n’t be opposed to that , would you ? Or , I ’m sorry , Smuckers ? ”
34560	34569	34570	34570	I	2726	“ That ’s the last thing I expected , ”
34572	34580	34581	34581	Henry	102	“ Do you want to spearhead it ? ”
34584	34587	34588	34588	I	2726	“ Me ? ”
34594	34600	34588	34588	I	2726	“ Is this a trick ? ”
34601	34624	34534	34534	Henry	102	“ Does asking for your help to identify a charity to give a million dollars to seem like a trick to you ? ”
34625	34630	34588	34588	I	2726	“ A million dollars ? ”
34631	34670	34671	34671	I	2726	“ For our portion . Partners might want to contribute if there ’s enough buzz . We can have a ceremony and introduce Smuckers . Have fun with it . Turn what my mother did into something positive . ”
34680	34685	34671	34671	I	2726	“ A million dollars ? ”
34686	34691	34692	34692	he	102	“ For our portion , ”
34711	34739	34704	34705	CAPS LOCK	161	“ And you can direct it to a specific organization . You know , if you have opinions . Or we can have a consultant handle it — ”
34740	34779	34671	34671	I	2726	“ No , I have opinions . There ’s this dog and cat rescue shelter my friend runs — they’re really good . They just started a stray drop - off center and they could do so much . ”
34780	34787	34704	34705	CAPS LOCK	161	“ Let ’s schedule it up . ”
34801	34826	34796	34796	He	102	“ Get the details and coordinate our calendars on the ceremony . Make a list of who to reach out to and all that . ”
34843	34848	34838	34838	he	102	“ Good with you ? ”
34870	34881	34882	34882	I	2726	“ Thank you . They ’re going to be excited , ”
34885	34890	34882	34882	I	2726	“ That is generous . ”
34891	34901	34902	34902	April	127	“ It ’s what the Locke Foundation is for . ”
34920	34930	34931	34931	Henry	102	“ You want to give your friend a call ? ”
34934	34963	34931	34931	Henry	102	“ We ’ll want to keep it under wraps until we orchestrate the PR angle , but we can float the donation as soon as they need it . ”
35031	35034	35035	35035	he	102	“ What ? ”
35038	35063	35035	35035	he	102	“ It ’s just really nice . For the memory of your mother . For animals in need . For my friend ’s organization . ”
35070	35078	35079	35079	he	102	“ I want to make this work , ”
35082	35098	35099	35099	He	102	“ There ’s no reason we all ca n’t get what we want , right ? ”
35110	35113	35099	35099	He	102	“ Truce ? ”
35194	35204	35205	35205	he	102	“ You know what we need to do now ? ”
35208	35211	35205	35205	he	102	“ What ? ”
35212	35221	35222	35222	he	102	“ Make one of those ridiculous giant checks , ”
35225	35244	35222	35222	he	102	“ That does n’t seem like the kind of thing that would be in a CEO job description . ”
35245	35267	35268	35268	He	102	“ It ’s in the CEO job description if the CEO says it is . I make the operational rules here . ”
35316	35319	35320	35320	I	2726	“ Hey … ”
35325	35333	35334	35334	He	102	“ You ca n’t just take Smuckers . ”
35357	35360	35350	35350	Henry	102	“ Fine . ”
35378	35390	35391	35391	he	102	“ The doors do n’t shut faster when you do that , ”
35394	35400	35391	35391	he	102	“ Shows what you know . ”
35410	35413	35414	35414	He	102	“ See ? ”
35441	35469	35470	35470	I	2726	“ We ’ll whip out the check at the fabrication facility . It ’ll be good for you to see some of the operations beyond the office . ”
35489	35495	35496	35498	the older one	1116	“ Oh , Mr. Locke ! ”
35501	35508	35496	35498	the older one	1116	“ We can take the next . ”
35509	35517	35518	35518	He	1116	“ Come on , there ’s room . ”
35598	35602	35603	35605	the other woman	587	“ Thank you , ”
35678	35690	35664	35664	My	2726	“ We ’ve got the Prime - Valu people on four , ”
35705	35718	35719	35719	She	587	“ That room projector bulb issue , but just to be safe … ”
35746	35750	35727	35727	He	102	“ Excellent call . ”
36096	36102	36103	36104	the boy	102	“ Are you smelling him ? ”
36107	36113	36103	36104	the boy	102	“ You were smelling him ! ”
36114	36121	36103	36104	the boy	102	“ No , I was n’t . ”
36122	36144	36145	36145	I	2726	“ You turned your face to him and your nostrils went in and out . That means you were smelling him . ”
36219	36225	36214	36214	He	102	“ You were smelling me ? ”
36231	36241	36214	36214	He	102	“ Why would I be interested in smelling you ? ”
36242	36259	36260	36260	He	102	“ I can think of a lot of reasons you ’d be interested in smelling me . ”
36282	36286	36270	36270	He	102	“ Name one . ”
36287	36290	36291	36291	His	102	“ Hmm . ”
36298	36307	36291	36291	His	102	“ I ’m going to go with lust . ”
36308	36320	36270	36270	He	102	“ Oh my god , you are so full of yourself . ”
36321	36328	36270	36270	He	102	“ That ’s not a no . ”
36329	36341	36342	36342	He	102	“ Seriously ? Do you automatically assume every woman wants you ? ”
36348	36389	36390	36390	He	102	“ Seriously . You think everyone lives to scrape at your feet , scrambling for crumbs of your attention and approval ? Trying to smell you ? And if a girl is truly lucky , maybe you ’ll pick her ? ”
36399	36402	36403	36403	I	2726	“ Well ? ”
36406	36428	36403	36403	I	2726	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . Are you waiting for an answer ? I thought that was a rhetorical question . ”
36429	36434	36435	36435	He	102	“ Oh my god ! ”
36706	36716	36688	36688	Henry	102	“ How do you feel about walking a bit ? ”
36717	36724	36725	36725	He	102	“ I ’d love a walk . ”
37012	37019	37008	37008	Henry	77	“ You ’re good with him . ”
37020	37028	37029	37029	he	77	“ We grew up with these dogs , ”
37043	37058	37035	37035	I	2726	“ Hey , we have to walk up the next street . Come on . ”
37072	37076	37059	37059	I	2726	“ Griffin Place . ”
37077	37080	37008	37008	Henry	77	“ What ? ”
37081	37089	37090	37090	I	2726	“ Griffin Place , my fave building . ”
37103	37122	37090	37090	I	2726	“ See ? My sister , Carly , and I … it ’s just one of our favorites . ”
37123	37130	37131	37131	he	77	“ Oh , the Reinhold building , ”
37134	37137	37138	37138	I	2726	“ Right , ”
37141	37149	37138	37138	I	2726	“ You probably know all the names . ”
37150	37164	37090	37090	I	2726	“ Being a smirkitect , you know . It goes with the territory . ”
37165	37169	37170	37170	I	2726	“ The Reinhold , ”
37194	37206	37207	37207	He	77	“ In all of Manhattan ? You like the Reinhold best ? ”
37211	37218	37207	37207	He	77	“ What ? It ’s great . ”
37219	37222	37223	37223	He	77	“ Hmm . ”
37317	37322	37302	37302	He	1166	“ What about it ? ”
37337	37343	37344	37344	I	2726	“ It ’s the griffin , ”
37348	37363	37344	37344	I	2726	“ What is it about the griffin ? A lot of buildings have them . ”
37364	37370	37371	37371	I	2726	“ I do n’t know , ”
37379	37382	37371	37371	I	2726	“ Aesthetically ? ”
37383	37386	37387	37387	I	2726	“ No . ”
37414	37417	37408	37408	I	2726	“ Symbolically . ”
37418	37425	37433	37433	I	2726	“ What does this one symbolize ? ”
37426	37432	37433	37433	I	2726	“ A moment in time , ”
37436	37460	37461	37461	I	2726	“ When my sister and I first got here , we got lost . We took this bus and it was a disaster . ”
37477	37502	37461	37461	I	2726	“ She was crying , and I pointed this griffin out and made up this stupid story about him being our brave protector friend . ”
37517	37525	37511	37511	I	2726	“ Did he help ? The griffin ? ”
37526	37530	37531	37531	I	2726	“ A lot , ”
37534	37570	37531	37531	I	2726	“ She stopped crying and we took pictures of him . I printed one out and put it in the kitchen . If nothing else , he scared the cockroaches back down into the drain . ”
37571	37580	37511	37511	I	2726	“ You came here after your parents died . ”
37581	37590	37591	37591	I	2726	“ Somebody has been busy investigating my background , ”
37594	37605	37606	37606	I	2726	“ Surely you ’re not surprised we investigated . Considering . ”
37899	37915	37916	37916	he	168	“ We make doors and windows , refurbish heating plants , that sort of thing , ”
37922	37939	37916	37916	he	168	“ Locke owns so much property , it stopped making sense to sub this stuff out . ”
38069	38081	38082	38082	He	168	“ I ’ll cut this down a little for the check . ”
38105	38133	38134	38134	He	168	“ I do n’t actually do this , typically , but I do n’t want to pull people off jobs that have been waiting in a queue . ”
38211	38222	38223	38223	He	168	“ Maybe we should get an armored car for this . ”
38249	38253	38254	38254	he	168	“ Come here , ”
38293	38306	38307	38307	he	168	“ We have a few exciting projects you should be in on , ”
38345	38367	38368	38368	Henry	77	“ I thought architects only made these on TV . I mean , do n’t you have computers for this nowadays ? ”
38379	38430	38431	38431	He	168	“ Building is one of the most tactile things you can do . We ’re creating physical environments . Making them tiny first , holding them and situating them , it reveals new things about the buildings and the spatial relationships . You see what feels right on the ground . ”
38437	38442	38431	38431	He	168	“ Where is this ? ”
38443	38467	38468	38468	I	2726	“ Nowhere yet . It ’s going to be along the Queens waterfront . The Ten — that ’s what we call it . ”
38478	38497	38468	38468	I	2726	“ Dude , I hate to tell you , but Queens is all built up along the river . ”
38498	38529	38431	38431	He	168	“ There ’s a swath of factories there that are moving to a less expensive area . We ’ll knock them down and replace it with residential and green space . ”
38530	38535	38536	38536	He	168	“ It looks nice . ”
38541	38550	38551	38551	I	2726	“ You do n’t think it looks nice ? ”
38554	38569	38551	38551	I	2726	“ It could be better , but it ’s good for what it is . ”
38570	38583	38431	38431	He	168	“ If it could be better , why not make it better ? ”
38584	38591	38592	38592	Smuckers	1007	“ Too deep in the pipeline . ”
38801	38806	38807	38807	Henry	77	“ Right . Okay . ”
38982	38990	38965	38965	He	77	“ This ’ll just take a minute . ”
38991	39002	38965	38965	He	77	“ Do you need it for a presentation or something ? ”
39003	39013	39014	39014	he	77	“ No , it just needs to be fixed , ”
39142	39145	39139	39139	his	77	“ just right ”
39206	39224	39225	39225	I	2726	“ Are you sure this whole business is n’t a front for guys who are closet crafters ? ”
39243	39251	39228	39228	He	77	“ This ’ll just take a minute . ”
39402	39414	39399	39399	I	2726	“ So , what ’s the deal ? Why the urgency ? ”
39415	39438	39439	39439	He	77	“ The guy who makes our environmental elements , these tiny trees ? He ’s from my grandfather ’s era … shit . ”
39445	39453	39439	39439	He	77	“ It ’s just a long story . ”
39483	39488	39489	39489	I	2726	“ Quite the perfectionist , ”
39492	39497	39498	39498	he	2726	“ Something like that , ”
39535	39546	39547	39547	I	2726	“ An earthquake and a hurricane at the same time , ”
39550	39560	39561	39561	He	77	“ Not a lot of buildings will withstand that . ”
39569	39575	39576	39576	He	77	“ See those balsa dowels ? ”
39586	39592	39576	39576	He	77	“ Can you grab one ? ”
39701	39704	39691	39691	he	77	“ Crap . ”
39705	39714	39715	39715	I	2726	“ You could pretend it ’s Spanish moss , ”
39723	39728	39718	39718	He	77	“ You need help ? ”
39729	39759	39691	39691	he	77	“ I got it . I used to do a lot of this as a boy . Brett and me both . We ’d spend hours doing these models . ”
39760	39767	39718	39718	He	77	“ When was the last time ? ”
39768	39780	39718	39718	He	77	“ I got this . It ’s like riding a bike . ”
39781	39789	39790	39790	I	2726	“ Except you have large hands now , ”
39813	39844	39845	39845	I	2726	“ It ’s too bad you do n’t have somebody with you who has way more recent experience gluing tiny things to tiny surfaces with her slim , womanly hands , ”
39848	39863	39864	39864	He	77	“ It ’s really a shame that there is n’t anybody like that here . ”
39873	39880	39881	39881	I	2726	“ Dude . Let me help . ”
39888	39910	39881	39881	I	2726	“ You think you ’re an expert because of your Etsy dog collar store ? This is a little more intricate . ”
39911	39924	39925	39925	I	2726	“ I make jewelry of all kinds , not just dog stuff , ”
39929	39933	39934	39934	he	77	“ We know , ”
39937	39967	39968	39968	He	77	“ Come on . You make the trunks and shave the branch curlies and I ’ll do the gluing . And please , your technique ? With the toothpick ? ”
39973	39979	39968	39968	He	77	“ You think you can ? ”
40009	40015	40016	40016	He	77	“ I know I can . ”
40065	40073	40042	40042	I	2726	“ Oh . That ’s more efficient . ”
40074	40080	40081	40081	I	2726	“ Was that a compliment ? ”
40094	40103	40104	40104	I	2726	“ Gluing stuff is my jam , baby . ”
40781	40788	40789	40789	she	297	“ That ’s a good one , ”
40977	40983	40962	40962	She	297	“ What do you think ? ”
40992	40999	41000	41000	I	2726	“ Why did you leave Vermont ? ”
41003	41006	41000	41000	I	2726	“ What ? ”
41007	41019	40962	40962	She	297	“ Two young girls . Their parents die . Why leave ? ”
41033	41038	41039	41039	She	297	“ Why not stay ? ”
41043	41055	41039	41039	She	297	“ Prescott ’s in the middle of nowhere . Very rural . ”
41056	41071	41072	41072	She	297	“ If I wanted to know that , I would ’ve looked on Google . ”
41136	41150	41131	41131	Her	297	“ Surely you knew people there . You came to a strange city . ”
41151	41159	41160	41160	She	297	“ I didn’t … like it there . ”
41170	41173	41174	41174	She	297	“ Why ? ”
41186	41234	41235	41235	She	297	“ This thing happened when I was in high school , and people hated me . Really hated me . Not normal hate but a certain incident got me a high level of hate all through that area . I did n’t do anything wrong , but … ”
41239	41252	41235	41235	She	297	“ It does n’t matter . It was one of those things . ”
41321	41329	41314	41314	she	297	“ It must have been … hard . ”
41330	41339	41340	41340	she	297	“ Alone and hated is a different country , ”
41377	41421	41368	41368	She	297	“ Being hated , it ’s like a burn . It keeps hurting long after . And little things that do n’t hurt other people sting like hell . Sometimes even sunshine hurts . I do n’t know why I ’m telling you . ”
41495	41503	41472	41472	She	297	“ Should we redo this light pole ? ”
41504	41507	41508	41508	I	2726	“ Probably , ”
41531	41548	41524	41524	I	2726	“ The long sticks are the hardest to cut . There ’s a trick to it . ”
41615	41618	41619	41619	she	297	“ What ? ”
41663	41668	41655	41655	We	1244	“ This looks good . ”
41692	41699	41684	41684	She	297	“ You ca n’t even tell . ”
41707	41712	41700	41700	I	2726	“ You ca n’t . ”
41713	41730	41731	41731	She	297	“ Are you going to tell me why it ’s so important to have it right ? ”
41740	41743	41744	41744	I	2726	“ Nope , ”
41748	41760	41744	41744	I	2726	“ What ? You ’re just not going to tell me ? ”
41761	41764	41765	41765	I	2726	“ Hmm … ”
41771	41774	41775	41775	Her	297	“ Nope . ”
41779	41783	41784	41784	I	2726	“ Just nope ? ”
41787	41799	41800	41800	She	297	“ Oh screw off . You think you ’re so funny . ”
41805	41843	41800	41800	She	297	“ Henry . All eyes upon Henry , prince of all he sees . He ’s New York ’s most eligible bastard ! He knows all your names and oh my god , he ’s soooo funny . ”
41844	41852	41853	41853	I	2726	“ What did you just call me ? ”
41861	41866	41853	41853	I	2726	“ You heard me . ”
41910	41939	41882	41882	she	297	“ You said it would look different if you got your way . If it was n’t so far into the pipeline . How would it be different ? ”
41955	41982	41949	41949	She	297	“ Have you ever noticed how a lot of new buildings create a dead zone around them ? Hunks of metal and stone that stop everything ? ”
41983	41993	41882	41882	she	297	“ Well , that ’s the point , right ? ”
41994	42000	42001	42001	I	2726	“ It should n’t be , ”
42008	42036	42001	42001	I	2726	“ I want buildings that are n’t a one - sided conversation . Buildings should never feel like walls . They should feel soft instead of hard . ”
42076	42092	42096	42096	she	297	“ I do n’t get it . How can you make a building like that ? ”
42146	42167	42168	42168	I	2726	“ Look at how porous it is . It does n’t block anything , it does n’t impose its will . ”
42176	42184	42185	42185	She	297	“ See how it invites and engages ? ”
42194	42199	42185	42185	She	297	“ Like a dance . ”
42212	42269	42270	42270	I	2726	“ Exactly . Something like this would create a sense of place that draws people . The Ten is good for what it is . Locke is going to deliver better than anyone else , but if I had total control I ’d do something vastly superior . Look at the way these structural elements invite … ”
42290	42299	42285	42285	She	297	“ Why design it in the inferior way ? ”
42300	42333	42334	42334	I	2726	“ It ’s a Kaleb project , and he ’s protecting our profit . He has a minimum profit - per - square - foot dollar figure that … keeps things boring . ”
42360	42369	42370	42370	she	297	“ And you want to make something cool , ”
42373	42378	42370	42370	she	297	“ Screw the profit . ”
42379	42397	42398	42398	Her	297	“ Nah . I ’m not running a charity . We can make more money my way . ”
42404	42410	42398	42398	Her	297	“ Your vastly superior way . ”
42463	42467	42468	42468	My	2726	“ Vastly superior . ”
42473	42481	42468	42468	My	2726	“ Were I to have total control . ”
42610	42613	42614	42614	she	297	“ Henry , ”
42620	42625	42626	42626	she	297	“ Oh my god , ”
42676	42683	42665	42665	I	2726	“ You want to walk away ? ”
42741	42748	42749	42749	I	2726	“ You want to walk away ? ”
42752	42758	42749	42749	I	2726	“ You do it now . ”
42918	42921	42901	42901	I	2726	“ Vicky , ”
42939	42946	42929	42929	She	297	“ You see me walking away ? ”
43108	43112	43113	43113	she	297	“ So superior , ”
43120	43126	43113	43113	she	297	“ When given complete control . ”
43519	43523	43524	43524	I	2726	“ So superior , ”
43527	43533	43534	43534	he	976	“ When given complete control , ”
43624	43633	43619	43619	He	976	“ Oh my god . So not happening . ”
43648	43651	43639	43639	He	976	“ What ? ”
43652	43655	43656	43656	I	2726	“ What ? ”
43659	43681	43656	43656	I	2726	“ Just another business problem with a business solution . And the solution is your magic peen ? Is that it ? ”
43702	43736	43690	43690	I	2726	“ You ’re not going to get your way by fooling me , and you ’re sure not going to get it like this . Smuckers and I are so out of here . ”
43737	43740	43741	43741	I	2726	“ Vicky — ”
44361	44371	44372	44372	I	2726	“ It ’s been everything we could ’ve imagined , ”
44375	44385	44372	44372	I	2726	“ A unique way to honor Bernadette ’s memory . ”
44386	44398	44399	44399	Brett	102	“ We ’re having a ceremony where Smuckers endows a shelter , ”
44402	44410	44411	44411	They	1290	“ We ’ll normalize things after that . ”
44420	44438	44411	44411	They	1290	“ But Smuckers is in complete agreement with us as far as a project like this goes . ”
44439	44444	44445	44445	Kaleb	292	“ Two paws up , ”
44471	44482	44483	44483	he	292	“ I ca n’t believe it ’s working this well , ”
44486	44505	44483	44483	he	292	“ The Smuckers thing . It ’s brilliant . As long as you can keep her under control . ”
44506	44516	44517	44517	I	2726	“ It ’s brilliant as long as nobody talks , ”
44599	44613	44614	44614	Brett	102	“ One drunken conversation with the wrong person and we ’re seriously hosed . ”
44633	44642	44621	44621	he	102	“ He ’d roll around in his grave . ”
44652	44662	44663	44663	I	2726	“ He ’d kick right out of his coffin , ”
44739	44749	44726	44726	I	2726	“ Who are you sending a Morrison truck to ? ”
44750	44759	44760	44760	He	102	“ Vicky . She has a griffin thing . ”
44769	44772	44760	44760	He	102	“ What ? ”
44773	44776	44726	44726	I	2726	“ Nothing . ”
44777	44782	44726	44726	I	2726	“ She ’s handled . ”
44783	44789	44790	44790	he	102	“ Did I say anything ? ”
44793	44799	44800	44800	I	2726	“ You were specifically silent , ”
44803	44808	44809	44809	He	102	“ So , yeah . ”
45012	45015	45016	45016	Brett	102	“ Soooooo , ”
45019	45031	45016	45016	Brett	102	“ How is operation good cop going ? Operation hot cop ? ”
45038	45045	45032	45032	I	2726	“ Just concentrate on your part . ”
45054	45057	45058	45058	He	102	“ What ? ”
45064	45070	45058	45058	He	102	“ Cat got your thumbs ? ”
45071	45089	45097	45097	he	102	“ If I ’m going to do a thing , I ’m going to do it right . ”
45090	45096	45097	45097	he	102	“ Okay , Uncle Andy , ”
45104	45110	45111	45111	I	2726	“ It ’s under control , ”
45125	45129	45130	45130	I	2726	“ You sure ? ”
45147	45162	45163	45163	I	2726	“ She has a griffin thing . From when she first got to town . ”
45168	45185	45163	45163	I	2726	“ Did that PI ever say anything about any kind of bullying incident in her past ? ”
45186	45214	45224	45224	I	2726	“ No . Though bullying does n’t always get reported . Her background is a little sparse . Her internet footprint is small for somebody her age . ”
45215	45223	45224	45224	I	2726	“ Something big happened back in Prescott , ”
45227	45249	45224	45224	I	2726	“ Somebody really did a number on her . Turned a lot of the town against her , it sounds like . ”
45250	45259	45224	45224	I	2726	“ I can ask the PI about it . ”
45260	45264	45265	45265	I	2726	“ Do it , ”
45268	45294	45265	45265	I	2726	“ Somebody went after her , and I want to know who . I want to know what happened and I want to know who . ”
45303	45312	45295	45295	I	2726	“ Is this part of operation good cop ? ”
45313	45320	45321	45321	I	2726	“ Just get me the details . ”
45650	45658	45639	45639	Carly	470	“ That ’s what you ’re wearing ? ”
45659	45667	45668	45668	I	2726	“ I have something to tell you , ”
45671	45681	45668	45668	I	2726	“ I 'm signing the company over to Henry . ”
45682	45687	45688	45688	she	470	“ Ex - cuuuuuse ? ”
45695	45706	45688	45688	she	470	“ It ’s not mine . It ’s not right . ”
45707	45714	45668	45668	I	2726	“ It belongs to poor Smuckers . ”
45715	45719	45720	45720	I	2726	“ Come on , ”
45723	45740	45668	45668	I	2726	“ It ’s Henry ’s birthright . I ’m going to have Smuckers sign it over . ”
45741	45748	45688	45688	she	470	“ But … all the money ! ”
45749	45755	45688	45688	she	470	“ It ’s not ours . ”
45756	45763	45764	45764	Carly	470	“ He tried to trick you , ”
45767	45779	45764	45764	Carly	470	“ He tried to bully you . He had you detained ! ”
45780	45787	45668	45668	I	2726	“ And now all that ends . ”
45788	45809	45764	45764	Carly	470	“ So a rich , entitled asshole who thinks he can get his way all the time gets his way ? ”
45844	45848	45849	45849	I	2726	“ Decision made , ”
45857	45869	45870	45870	I	2726	“ Hooooold on . This is a pretty major financial decision . ”
45874	45883	45870	45870	I	2726	“ A multi - billion - dollar decision . ”
45884	45907	45870	45870	I	2726	“ Well , are you forgetting something , perhaps ? A certain cooling off period that we promised each other to honor ? ”
45908	45913	45870	45870	I	2726	“ This is different . ”
45914	45934	45935	45935	I	2726	“ How ? It ’s a major financial decision . It affects us both — that ’s our pact . ”
45941	45946	45935	45935	I	2726	“ I ca n’t — ”
45947	45956	45957	45957	she	470	“ We keep our word to each other , ”
45960	45963	45957	45957	she	470	“ Right ? ”
45987	45999	46006	46006	me	2726	“ I have to at least tell him . He ’s … ”
46008	46014	46006	46006	me	2726	“ He ’s in misery . ”
46015	46028	46029	46029	Carly	470	“ Oh , no , no , no , no , noooo ! ”
46042	46073	46074	46074	she	470	“ Making a commitment is a promise . If you ’re good for your word , saying you ’ll do a thing is like doing a thing . Same as , ”
46077	46117	46074	46074	she	470	“ We keep our word , us two . And Henry and the rest of the Worldwide Cocks , what with their do - the - right - thing bullshit and then they try to trick you ? Please — ”
46118	46123	46124	46124	I	2726	“ Okay , okay . ”
46130	46138	46124	46124	I	2726	“ But I ’m giving it back . ”
46139	46153	46154	46154	I	2726	“ If you so decide after your cooling off period , then yes . ”
46165	46181	46182	46182	She	470	“ I do n’t know if I hate you or love you more right now . ”
46185	46211	46182	46182	She	470	“ And you can not verbally commit to it . No I ’m giving you your company back but I have to humor my sister . ”
46222	46225	46226	46226	she	470	“ Bird , ”
46297	46301	46302	46302	he	1007	“ Good morning , ”
46337	46340	46341	46341	I	2726	“ Hi , ”
46399	46403	46404	46404	I	2726	“ Thank you . ”
46407	46414	46404	46404	I	2726	“ So . A groundbreaking ceremony . ”
46415	46428	46429	46429	He	1007	“ It ’s one of the things you two’ll be doing now . ”
46452	46457	46458	46458	I	2726	“ Oh my god . ”
46470	46478	46458	46458	I	2726	“ I do n’t know about this . ”
46479	46483	46484	46484	Henry	102	“ Come on , ”
46487	46493	46484	46484	Henry	102	“ A little team spirit . ”
46494	46506	46507	46507	Henry	102	“ Poor Smuckers . He ’s officially on team Cock Worldwide . ”
46512	46517	46507	46507	Henry	102	“ What was that ? ”
46518	46522	46523	46523	I	2726	“ Cock Worldwide ? ”
46535	46549	46550	46550	He	102	“ What ? Are you honestly telling me you ’ve never heard that ? ”
46563	46574	46557	46557	he	102	“ Cock Worldwide . That ’s not a … thing . ”
46575	46581	46582	46582	He	102	“ You do n’t know ? ”
46586	46592	46593	46593	I	2726	“ Nobody calls us that . ”
46596	46644	46645	46645	He	102	“ Yeah , nobody except everybody who stands on the ground looking up at the giant cranes . I get that the logo is supposed to look like a building between two bushes , but seriously ? And just … the giant cranes ? Erecting massive buildings ? ”
46671	46679	46680	46680	he	102	“ People would n’t call us that , ”
46683	46694	46680	46680	he	102	“ It ’s cute that you do n’t even know . ”
46695	46704	46712	46712	I	2726	“ I think somebody has an overactive imagination . ”
46705	46711	46712	46712	I	2726	“ Oh , meaning me ? ”
46715	46727	46712	46712	I	2726	“ You think it ’s only me who calls it that ? ”
46728	46742	46680	46680	he	102	“ Yeah , I do . Which reveals the direction of your thoughts . ”
46743	46747	46748	46748	I	2726	“ So arrogant , ”
46776	46807	46771	46771	I	2726	“ I ’m not the one covering the city with massive phallic symbols emblazoned with my name . It ’s the direction of your thoughts we should be concerned about . ”
46808	46817	46818	46818	he	102	“ Like a Rorschach ink - blot test , ”
46821	46840	46818	46818	he	102	“ Some people see cranes , the progress of a city , but you see something quite different . ”
46841	46848	46849	46849	I	2726	“ Oh , pull - ease . ”
46864	46876	46877	46877	I	2726	“ You ready to be on team Cock Worldwide , buddy ? ”
46888	46896	46877	46877	I	2726	“ People would n’t call us that . ”
46897	46910	46911	46911	Henry	102	“ Think what you want . The world is your golden crib . ”
46939	46957	46923	46923	Locke	77	“ The loop on that L looks like a C. You have to at least admit that . ”
46958	46966	46967	46967	He	102	“ Well … Cock Worldwide , huh . ”
46972	46978	46967	46967	He	102	“ If the name fits … ”
46979	46984	46985	46985	I	2726	“ Oh my god ! ”
46996	47002	47003	47003	He	102	“ You are so bad ! ”
47066	47072	47073	47073	he	102	“ What ’s going on ? ”
47076	47093	47073	47073	he	102	“ Your fake seduction plan . You think I ’m that stupid or just that desperate ? ”
47094	47099	47043	47043	God	146	“ Look at me . ”
47105	47108	47043	47043	God	146	“ Vicky . ”
47116	47138	47109	47109	I	2726	“ I would never think you ’re stupid or desperate . They ’re the last things I ’d think of you . ”
47139	47164	47043	47043	God	146	“ I know what you ’re doing . And just … I want you to understand that you do n’t have to do it . ”
47258	47264	47247	47247	His	102	“ Kiss me , Vicky . ”
47265	47270	47247	47247	His	102	“ I ca n’t . ”
47271	47275	47276	47276	His	102	“ Kiss me . ”
47283	47288	47276	47276	His	102	“ Be with me . ”
47319	47324	47293	47293	He	102	“ You want to . ”
47325	47330	47331	47331	I	2726	“ You are so … ”
47377	47382	47351	47351	He	102	“ You are so … ”
47432	47440	47441	47441	he	102	“ You ’re going to kiss me , ”
47444	47460	47441	47441	he	102	“ Maybe not today , but you ’ll come to me . I can wait . ”
47461	47466	47467	47467	I	2726	“ Such an operator , ”
47487	47498	47499	47499	He	102	“ You like watching my hands , do n’t you ? ”
47504	47515	47516	47516	I	2726	“ Are you just undoing my buttons now ? Yes , ”
47519	47526	47516	47516	I	2726	“ And you ’re into it . ”
47527	47538	47539	47539	I	2726	“ And the arrogance just does n’t quit , folks . ”
47555	47564	47565	47565	He	102	“ You like my hands , I think . ”
47577	47593	47565	47565	He	102	“ You ’re going to like them even better when they ’re between your legs . ”
47600	47605	47606	47606	I	2726	“ Oh my god , ”
47621	47665	47606	47606	I	2726	“ I ’ll get you off , baby . I ’ll take such good care of you . I ’ll take you slow and deep . I ’ll print every inch of your skin . Nothing — nothing about it will be fake . ”
47666	47670	47671	47671	I	2726	“ So entitled , ”
47692	47703	47685	47685	He	102	“ I ’ll wait . I can bide my time . ”
47704	47719	47725	47725	his	102	“ Well , you ’re going to have to wind your watch to infinity . ”
47761	47769	47770	47770	He	102	“ So what is this groundbreaking thing ? ”
47794	47797	47789	47789	I	2726	“ Seriously ? ”
48179	48189	48190	48190	I	2726	“ You guys got him a little Locke shovel , ”
48200	48204	48190	48190	I	2726	“ Nice optics . ”
48205	48212	48213	48213	he	102	“ I meant what I said , ”
48216	48221	48213	48213	he	102	“ I ’m waiting . ”
48222	48231	48232	48232	I	2726	“ For me to come and kiss you , ”
48235	48245	48232	48232	I	2726	“ And then all bets are off , Vicky . ”
48251	48259	48232	48232	I	2726	“ I heard you the first time . ”
48283	48290	48291	48291	He	102	“ Do you not like dogs ? ”
48294	48299	48291	48291	He	102	“ I like dogs . ”
48300	48344	48355	48355	He	102	“ I do n’t think you do . The only time you ever pet Smuckers is … for a purpose . You want to make him paddle his legs or calm down or something . You never just pet him out of fun . ”
48345	48354	48355	48355	He	102	“ He ’s just a dog , Vicky . ”
48372	48381	48362	48362	I	2726	“ You hardly ever even say his name . ”
48382	48389	48390	48390	He	102	“ Smuckers is just a dog . ”
48396	48401	48390	48390	He	102	“ Is that better ? ”
48402	48412	48362	48362	I	2726	“ A dog your mother left her company to . ”
48413	48478	48479	48479	I	2726	“ You think I ’m jealous of a dog ? Please , Vicky . If I wanted to wear my hair in a marshmallow Afro and live in a woman ’s purse , I think I could find a way to arrange it . This is New York , after all . There is probably a dominatrix out there who ’d make it happen . ”
48484	48518	48479	48479	I	2726	“ You know what I find weird ? People are n’t freaking out about Smuckers ’s control of the company very much . They all seem to think it ’s a PR stunt . ”
48519	48538	48601	48601	he	2726	“ A lot of people see it as a PR stunt . Connected to his dog shelter gift . ”
48539	48548	48479	48479	I	2726	“ And you ’re letting them think that . ”
48549	48553	48479	48479	I	2726	“ We are . ”
48554	48562	48563	48563	I	2726	“ Why not tell people the truth ? ”
48566	48574	48575	48575	He	2726	“ Unless … I do n’t know … ”
48578	48591	48592	48592	I	2726	“ Unless we have more evil plans to get rid of you ? ”
48644	48653	48655	48655	he	2726	“ You know how many people we employ ? ”
48662	48736	48737	48737	I	2726	“ Directly , we employ three hundred forty thousand people across ten offices worldwide . When you count vendors and subcontractors , it ’s double that . Those are real people with real lives and families and homes , people who depend on the health of this firm to make house payments and put food on the table . Do I want to announce that a Maltese is in charge of all that ? ”
48750	48791	48740	48740	I	2726	“ No . I ’m not going to rock the company with that kind of announcement . I ’m showing them that things remain consistent after Bernadette ’s death . I want them feeling strong , steady , capable leadership . ”
48792	48795	48796	48796	I	2726	“ Okay . ”
49070	49085	49086	49086	he	1007	“ You need to understand things to vote out of a place of knowledge , ”
49276	49285	49286	49286	I	2726	“ How do you know everyone ’s names ? ”
49296	49304	49286	49286	I	2726	“ I make a point of it . ”
49305	49315	49331	49331	he	77	“ But how ? You know so many names . ”
49316	49330	49331	49331	he	77	“ If something ’s important , you find a way to do it , ”
49349	49354	49339	49339	He	77	“ What was that ? ”
50260	50268	50272	50272	him	77	“ I know what you ’re doing , ”
50312	50319	50320	50320	He	77	“ Beyond the supposedly fake seduction ? ”
50496	50504	50505	50505	he	77	“ You know what I ’m doing ? ”
50508	50514	50505	50505	he	77	“ What would that be ? ”
50515	50526	50527	50527	I	2726	“ You want me to love Locke like you do , ”
50534	50566	50527	50527	I	2726	“ You ca n’t trick it out of my evil clutches , you ca n’t seduce me , so you ’re doing the next best thing . Trying to humanize it . ”
50567	50586	50505	50505	he	77	“ Do n’t count out the part where I seduce you . That ’s still going to happen . ”
50587	50590	50591	50591	I	2726	“ Uh , ”
50597	50611	50591	50591	I	2726	“ You probably think all women would just die for your magic peen . ”
50612	50618	50620	50620	he	77	“ Not all of them . ”
50627	50636	50637	50637	Gulp	195	“ Just the ones I ’ve slept with . ”
50639	50694	50637	50637	Gulp	195	“ And for the record , my seduction of you is n’t goal oriented . I ’d seduce you if all you had was a dog bow tie Etsy store . Though , really , I should turn you in for animal cruelty . Because those bow ties you put Smuckers in ? No . ”
50695	50703	50709	50709	Henry	77	“ He likes his little bow ties . ”
50704	50708	50709	50709	Henry	77	“ Trust me , ”
50712	50722	50709	50709	Henry	77	“ He does n’t like the little bow ties . ”
50723	50731	50732	50732	His	77	“ I think you ’re just jealous . ”
50736	50743	50732	50732	His	77	“ That ’s what you think ? ”
50744	50753	50764	50764	He	77	“ Maybe I ’ll make one for you . ”
50754	50763	50764	50764	He	77	“ My neck has a lot of girth . ”
50769	50778	50779	50779	I	2726	“ You ’d need a lot of sequins . ”
50810	50855	50807	50807	I	2726	“ You ’re trying to make me see how important Locke is to all your family . Keeping me from killing it . You think I ’ll kill Locke , but you do n’t have to worry . Things are going to be okay . ”
50856	50868	50869	50869	he	77	“ I do n’t think you ’re going to kill it , ”
50911	50925	50905	50905	I	2726	“ Right now , I ’m thinking about killing this . You mind ? ”
50957	50960	50961	50961	I	2726	“ Crackly , ”
51047	51057	51026	51026	He	77	“ This would ’ve ended up in a landfill . ”

51079	51082	51083	51083	I	2726	“ Apparently . ”
51164	51171	51147	51147	He	77	“ This is cool as hell , ”
51182	51192	51175	51175	He	77	“ We ’re not even in the building yet . ”
51193	51199	51200	51200	I	2726	“ Kaleb must hate it , ”
51203	51217	51218	51218	he	77	“ I practically had to give up my firstborn to make this happen , ”
51221	51248	51249	51249	He	77	“ Running this place , I do n’t get to design and build that much anymore , or really getting my hands dirty on any level . ”
51263	51275	51259	51259	he	77	“ You have to see from the top . Come on . ”
51406	51409	51402	51402	We	1401	“ freight elevator ”

51732	51740	51729	51729	I	2726	“ It ’s just a little rickety . ”
51741	51754	51755	51755	He	77	“ I forget you ’re not used to this . Totally safe . ”
51762	51765	51755	51755	He	77	“ Okay ? ”
51784	51787	51788	51788	I	2726	“ Okay , ”
51791	51814	51815	51815	I	2726	“ I would n’t put you in here if I did n’t know it was safe . I would n’t do that . ”
51848	51860	51841	51841	I	2726	“ But if you want to smell me , you can . ”
52046	52054	52055	52055	he	77	“ You look hot in the hat , ”
52058	52065	52055	52055	he	77	“ You ’re just saying that . ”

52361	52380	52393	52393	He	77	“ That ’s actually a message . It ’s there to show the electricians the alarm conduit placement . ”
52381	52389	52390	52390	I	2726	“ How can you even read it ? ”
52418	52452	52412	52412	he	77	“ This is orientation . Right here is just a measurement . The fact that it ’s orange means any kind of telecom , but this ’ll be an alarm , of course . ”
52524	52530	52515	52515	I	2726	“ The colors tell you ? ”
52531	52541	52493	52493	He	77	“ Just like you see down on the street . ”
52542	52552	52553	52553	He	77	“ You ’re all secretly communicating with each other ? ”
52556	52570	52571	52571	His	77	“ Yellow ’s natural gas . Red ’s electric . Blue is water . ”
52590	52594	52587	52587	I	2726	“ You cold ? ”
52775	52785	52767	52767	his	77	“ I ’m so glad you could see this . ”

53888	53911	53912	53912	He	77	“ Is this what I ’m doing when you beat off ? Do n’t bother trying to tell me you do n’t . ”
53957	53966	53967	53967	He	77	“ I love how you move on me . ”
53988	53992	53993	53993	he	77	“ Like this ? ”
53996	54006	53993	53993	he	77	“ Is this what I do to you next ? ”

54254	54266	54251	54251	I	2726	“ But is n’t this a little bit exposed up here ? ”
54267	54274	54275	54275	he	77	“ Nobody sees you but me , ”

55665	55668	55669	55669	he	77	“ Shit , ”
55672	55677	55678	55678	I	2726	“ What is that ? ”

55854	55869	55846	55846	he	77	“ Okay , that just makes me think we ’re going to crash headfirst , ”
55873	55885	55870	55870	I	2726	“ Or something is going to crash on top of us . ”
55886	55892	55893	55893	he	77	“ None of the above , ”
55903	55946	55947	55947	I	2726	“ I ’m only putting it on you because I know I ’d lose points off the manliness portion of the New York ’s Most Eligible Bastard competition if people knew I was hogging the only hardhat in a situation like this . ”
55950	55956	55957	55957	He	77	“ Here ’s my thinking . ”
55964	56004	56005	56005	Hammers	201	“ We know I can win the swimsuit part of the Most Eligible Bastard competition . And I have the name memorization bit nailed . But as you can imagine , the manliness portion is extremely important to me . ”
56013	56022	56005	56005	Hammers	201	“ You can smell me if you want . ”
56023	56031	56032	56032	He	77	“ I ’m so not smelling you . ”
56058	56077	56005	56005	Hammers	201	“ My guys are down there working on the machinery . It ’s a simple winch starter issue … ”
56078	56084	56085	56085	I	2726	“ A winch starter issue , ”
56088	56095	56085	56085	I	2726	“ Like what ? Tell me . ”
56096	56106	56005	56005	Hammers	201	“ You want to hear about the winch issue ? ”
56107	56132	56133	56133	I	2726	“ Did I burn it out like you said I would ? Wait , do n’t answer that . Just tell me about winches . ”
56152	56163	56143	56143	I	2726	“ Start at the beginning . The history of winches . ”
56164	56170	56171	56171	I	2726	“ Are you being sarcastic ? ”
56188	56201	56202	56202	He	77	“ I ’m being sarcastic , but also I want you to . ”
56220	56231	56209	56209	He	77	“ I have something better to tell . My secret . ”
56232	56238	56209	56209	He	77	“ You have a secret ? ”
56239	56246	56247	56247	I	2726	“ How I do the names . ”
56260	56263	56247	56247	I	2726	“ How ? ”
56264	56292	56209	56209	He	77	“ I took a class in memorization techniques . You ca n’t say anything . I do n’t ever want our employees to feel like a number . ”
56293	56303	56209	56209	He	77	“ You took a class ? That ’s commitment . ”
56304	56359	56247	56247	I	2726	“ It means a lot to people , and as the company grew , it got harder and harder . So I took the class . I know it sounds a little intense , but people … they see me in a certain way , and I do n’t like to let them down . ”
56360	56363	56364	56364	I	2726	“ Wow , ”
56367	56385	56386	56386	He	2726	“ You make it look so easy . You make it look so easy to be you . ”
56400	56441	56395	56395	my	2726	“ Anyway , everybody gets a special visualization location . If somebody is named Mike , I imagine him on a stage singing with a microphone . Clarence is in an orchestra playing a clarinet . Dirk is in dirt . ”
56442	56447	56491	56491	his	2726	“ What about Fernando ? ”
56448	56455	56395	56395	my	2726	“ Are you serious ? ABBA . ”
56456	56463	56395	56395	my	2726	“ Like it ’s so obvious . ”
56464	56469	56491	56491	his	2726	“ Is n’t it ? ”
56470	56478	56395	56395	my	2726	“ What did you use for me ? ”
56479	56485	56486	56486	I	2726	“ I ’m not telling . ”
56499	56503	56494	56494	I	2726	“ Come on . ”
56504	56509	56512	56512	I	2726	“ Nope . Sorry . ”
56528	56531	56532	56532	I	2726	“ Please , ”
56535	56538	56532	56532	I	2726	“ Nope . ”
56539	56564	56565	56565	He	2726	“ Hmmph . Well I ’ve got one for you , Henry . For the name Henry . And you wo n’t like it . ”
56569	56582	56583	56583	I	2726	“ You wo n’t like it . Not . At . All , ”
56591	56604	56583	56583	I	2726	“ There are thousands of employees ! You remember all their names ? ”
56605	56611	56621	56621	I	2726	“ Only the local ones . ”
56612	56620	56621	56621	I	2726	“ That ’s more than a thousand , ”
56624	56629	56621	56621	I	2726	“ That’s … intense . ”
56630	56646	56583	56583	I	2726	“ Once I started it , I felt like I had to keep it up . ”
56676	56684	56621	56621	I	2726	“ How long until we ’re out ? ”
56685	56698	56703	56703	I	2726	“ I do n’t know . Between ten minutes and an hour . ”
56699	56702	56703	56703	I	2726	“ Uh . ”
56735	56740	56721	56721	I	2726	“ Are you claustrophobic ? ”
56761	56774	56775	56775	he	2726	“ You seemed okay in the many elevators we ’ve been traveling , ”
56778	56797	56775	56775	he	2726	“ It ’s because this shaft feels like a well . The unfinished sides , the light above . ”
56798	56801	56775	56775	he	2726	“ Oh . ”
56807	56817	56775	56775	he	2726	“ Do you have … history with a well ? ”
56818	56824	56825	56825	I	2726	“ I fell in one , ”
56828	56855	56825	56825	I	2726	“ When I was younger . They did n’t find me for a pretty long time , and I was just terrified out of my mind . ”
56856	56860	56861	56861	I	2726	“ How long ? ”
56883	56887	56888	56888	I	2726	“ Long enough , ”
56891	56967	56968	56968	I	2726	“ I felt like I ’d fallen off the face of the earth . But most of all , it was terrifying . I was scared of the dark to start with . And you do n’t know how dark the bottom of a well is — you have no idea . I thought I ’d never get out . People could n’t find me . And there are slugs , and it ’s just … ”
56971	56980	56981	56981	He	2726	“ It was a long time in there . ”
56989	56996	56981	56981	He	2726	“ This is n’t a well . ”
56997	57001	57002	57002	I	2726	“ I know , ”
57005	57014	57015	57015	He	2726	“ But I kind of do n’t know . ”
57027	57033	57034	57034	he	2726	“ It would be scary , ”
57037	57048	57034	57034	he	2726	“ Alone . Not sure if you ’d be found . ”
57049	57052	57053	57053	I	2726	“ Yeah , ”
57101	57104	57105	57105	I	2726	“ Oh , ”
57108	57118	57105	57105	I	2726	“ Is that better ? Less well - like ? ”
57119	57126	57105	57105	I	2726	“ Thanks . It is better . ”
57127	57137	57105	57105	I	2726	“ You got out of that well , Vicky . ”
57138	57156	57157	57157	I	2726	“ I got out . And grew up to be a dog whisperer slash captain of industry , ”
57170	57183	57184	57184	Bangs	207	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m just messed up right now . ”
57191	57201	57184	57184	Bangs	207	“ It ’s hard to be powerless like that . ”
57202	57210	57211	57211	I	2726	“ It ’s more about the fear , ”
57214	57284	57211	57211	I	2726	“ Did you ever have that fear of footsteps in the dark ? And then you get to the warmth and light of safety and it ’s such a relief . But in the well , it was like the footsteps never stopped . Hour after hour , the terror kept grinding on . It took everything out of me . Fear is exhausting . Little - known fact . ”
57285	57293	57184	57184	Bangs	207	“ How long were you in it ? ”
57294	57302	57184	57184	Bangs	207	“ Can we talk about something else ? ”
57303	57312	57313	57313	he	2726	“ I 'm sorry that happened to you , ”
57316	57321	57322	57322	He	2726	“ Something . Else . ”
57325	57352	57322	57322	He	2726	“ You know that model we fixed together ? With the trees ? And I would n’t tell you why it was important to fix it ? ”
57353	57356	57211	57211	I	2726	“ Yeah . ”
57357	57454	57211	57211	I	2726	“ Okay , well , now I ’m telling you . There ’s this guy , Renaldo , he ’s the one who made it . He eighty - five , one of the oldest guys in all of Locke . He helped my grandfather and father build the company , and he definitely has enough money to retire , but building is his life . Those models take him forever to make , but Brett and I feel like it keeps him alive . And if he saw the thing destroyed … he’d be crushed . ”
57455	57460	57322	57322	He	2726	“ You seemed mad . ”
57461	57597	57211	57211	I	2726	“ Well , who ’s leaving their bevs all over the model ? Right ? Anyway , he was kind of an uncle to Brett and me . As my dad got too busy to deal with us , Renaldo was the one who ’d take us around , make us learn the ropes with the trades . Brett and I would go and do our homework at that place , and if we finished in time , Renaldo would give us little assignments . Make a five - inch bridge out of ten toothpicks and a piece of string , stuff like that . And there would be a test , like the bridge would have to extend between blocks spaced five inches apart and be able to support a stack of ten quarters . ”
57598	57617	57322	57322	He	2726	“ A bridge made out of just a piece of string and toothpicks ? How is that possible ? ”
57618	57641	57682	57682	He	1450	“ You ’d be surprised what you can make from a piece of string and toothpicks . It ’s excellent building material . ”
57642	57681	57682	57682	He	1450	“ Maybe this is the part where you reassure me that even though it ’s excellent building material , you went on to use more durable materials in the construction of things like freight elevators in boutique hotels . ”
57693	57702	57682	57682	He	1450	“ This thing ’s solid steel , baby . ”
57716	57728	57703	57703	I	2726	“ So you keep Renaldo on staff . That ’s sweet . ”
57729	57745	57749	57749	me	2726	“ He gave us an amazing education . He ’s a master builder — literally . ”
57767	57777	57760	57760	she	2248	“ Did your mom help out with the company ? ”
57778	57781	57782	57782	He	1450	“ No . ”
57806	57826	57796	57796	I	2726	“ I want to tell you something and have you hear me on it . Trust me on it . ”
57839	57842	57843	57843	He	1450	“ Yeah ? ”
57850	57860	57843	57843	He	1450	“ Your mother handed over the company to Smuckers . ”
57889	57910	57918	57918	He	1450	“ Things … tend to work themselves out . When something belongs to somebody , it tends to find them . ”
57911	57917	57918	57918	He	1450	“ What does that mean ? ”
57926	57944	57945	57945	I	2726	“ Is Smuckers giving back the company ? Is there something in the will that reverts it ? ”
57950	57960	57945	57945	I	2726	“ Things work out , do n’t you find ? ”
57961	57968	57918	57918	He	1450	“ You ca n’t say more ? ”
57969	57994	57995	57995	I	2726	“ I can swear to you that I never had my sights on Locke . I know you have no reason to trust me , ”
57998	58030	57995	57995	I	2726	“ I know what the evidence makes it look like . What it makes me look like . I 'm not that terrible person . It ’s not what everyone thinks . ”
58056	58063	58069	58069	me	2726	“ I want you to believe . ”
58071	58083	58069	58069	me	2726	“ I need you to believe in spite of the evidence . ”
58084	58087	58088	58088	He	2726	“ Hey . ”
58099	58104	58088	58088	He	2726	“ I believe you . ”
58123	58132	58133	58133	He	2726	“ I believe you . I trust you . ”
58138	58143	58144	58144	I	2726	“ I see you . ”
58219	58227	58228	58228	I	2726	“ Show me one of those bridges , ”
58231	58237	58238	58238	He	2726	“ I want to see . ”
58250	58262	58263	58263	He	2726	“ Brett sent me this last year . This is before . ”
58287	58290	58284	58284	He	2726	“ After . ”
58303	58306	58307	58307	I	2726	“ Awwww , ”
58310	58323	58324	58324	He	2726	“ Wait , I might have one of the old successful ones . ”
58352	58356	58357	58357	he	2726	“ Hold up , ”
58360	58375	58376	58376	He	2726	“ Do n’t think I ’m letting you out before finding a successful one . ”
58557	58593	58554	58554	I	2726	“ They used to make everything so ornate . Even the most lowly electrical thing was ornately designed . Buildings had pretty flourishes they did n’t need . Why do n’t they do it anymore ? ”
58594	58599	58600	58600	he	2726	“ We still do , ”
58603	58610	58600	58600	he	2726	“ Just in a different way . ”
58623	58636	58637	58637	he	2726	“ How cool would it be incorporated into a table or seating ? ”
58721	58739	58686	58686	I	2726	“ I know how to get this made into furniture . More awesome than you can imagine . ”
58753	58757	58758	58758	His	2726	“ Tell me . ”
58887	58893	58894	58894	He	2726	“ You got a truck ? ”
58950	58964	58931	58931	I	2726	“ Did you just ask Henry fucking Locke if he has a truck ? ”
59168	59179	59155	59155	We	1468	“ And you ’re not telling where we ’re going . ”
59180	59189	59190	59190	I	2726	“ Take a left up here on Oakerton , ”
59502	59513	59514	59514	I	2726	“ You have an alarm on this thing , right ? ”
59517	59523	59524	59524	he	2726	“ I ’m not worried , ”
59527	59540	59524	59524	he	2726	“ Who ’s going to steal a load of vintage construction debris ? ”
59541	59551	59552	59552	I	2726	“ Um , you ’re about to meet them , ”
59652	59656	59645	59645	I	2726	“ Lively today . ”
59671	59678	59679	59679	he	2726	“ What exactly is this place ? ”
59682	59696	59697	59697	We	1493	“ Southfield Place Makers Studio . It ’s a makers co - op . ”
59719	59732	59733	59733	I	2726	“ You have to sign up for some of the larger tools , ”
59736	59741	59742	59742	I	2726	“ They ’re shared . ”
59747	59764	59765	59765	He	2726	“ That guy does n’t always follow the rules , but things usually go really smoothly . ”
59802	59809	59783	59783	Latrisha	137	“ You do your jewelry here ? ”
59810	59834	59839	59839	he	2726	“ Well , I need venting for soldering . I think I ’d get evicted from my apartment if I tried it there . ”
59835	59838	59839	59839	he	2726	“ Damn , ”
59915	59926	59927	59927	I	2726	“ It seems a bit low rent , I know , ”
59930	59945	59946	59946	He	2726	“ but it ’s a great deal and the tools here are really good . ”
59998	60087	59992	59992	Latrisha	137	“ And it ’s not like we let just anyone in , much as it might look like that . People have to pay monthly and we can kick them out if they ’re assholes . I mean , it ’s hard to do this kind of stuff in the city ; it ’s not like we all have sheds in our yard , or even yards , and when you look at the start - up capital for like , a woodworker or even someone like me — ”
60088	60091	60092	60092	he	2726	“ Vicky , ”
60105	60117	60118	60118	I	2726	“ We all have lockers for our personal stuff over there , ”
60121	60125	60126	60126	He	2726	“ Watch out . ”
60166	60171	60172	60172	I	2726	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
60175	60180	60172	60172	I	2726	“ It ’s nothing . ”
60181	60185	60186	60186	I	2726	“ Tell me , ”
60194	60213	60189	60189	He	2726	“ It ’s a wealthy guy complaint . Trust me , you do n’t want to hear it . ”
60214	60223	60172	60172	I	2726	“ I know it seems a little shabby . ”
60224	60232	60189	60189	He	2726	“ You think that ’s the problem ? ”
60233	60239	60189	60189	He	2726	“ Or … low rent . ”
60240	60243	60244	60244	he	2726	“ Vicky , ”
60247	60259	60260	60260	he	2726	“ You ’re seriously apologizing for the state of the place ? ”
60263	60269	60270	60270	Shivers	211	“ It ’s utterly amazing . ”
60275	60280	60270	60270	Shivers	211	“ You think so ? ”
60281	60286	60189	60189	He	2726	“ I know so . ”
60287	60300	60270	60270	Shivers	211	“ I worried you ’d think it’s … I do n’t know . ”
60301	60377	60270	60270	Shivers	211	“ One of the little - understood things about having my kind of money is the insulation . It can be great — you’re insulated from tedious chores and time sucks , and I never have to talk to anybody who I specifically do n’t want to talk to ; other people talk to those people for me . But I ’m also insulated from something like this . I literally ca n’t have this . ”
60378	60385	60189	60189	He	2726	“ You could if you wanted . ”
60386	60454	60455	60455	He	1503	“ Yeah , okay , technically I can , because it ’s a free country , but I ’d almost have to come as somebody else . Like a poser . Look at me . I could buy an airplane hangar and fill it with the best tools money can buy before dinner . I ’d have to take a space from somebody who actually needs it . ”
60461	60480	60481	60481	I	2726	“ This place is awesome . And I can never be one of the people who belong here . ”
60526	60545	60516	60516	I	2726	“ I wanted you to like it . It ’s one of my favorite places in the world . ”
60550	60558	60546	60546	His	1503	“ I like it a whole lot . ”
60591	60600	60601	60601	he	1503	“ Do you have a lot of collaboration ? ”
60604	60617	60601	60601	he	1503	“ Do people walk around and see what each other is doing ? ”
60618	60657	60667	60667	he	1503	“ Yeah , people hook up on projects , but it ’s not as if we ’re walking around all dude , please tell me about this awesome creation of yours ! That would be a little dorky . ”
60658	60666	60667	60667	he	1503	“ They hook up from the lounge , ”
60670	60676	60677	60677	I	2726	“ More often than not , ”
60737	60763	60729	60729	I	2726	“ Latrisha , this is Henry . Henry , this is Latrisha . She makes furniture out of reclaimed stuff and it ’s freaking amazing . ”
60764	60767	60768	60768	he	77	“ Hey , ”
60775	60782	60768	60768	he	77	“ So nice to meet you . ”
60783	60786	60787	60787	Latrisha	137	“ Likewise . ”
60829	60838	60823	60823	her	212	“ I ’ve heard a lot about you . ”
60839	60855	60856	60856	Henry	77	“ I think I might be familiar with one of your recent pieces , actually , ”
60896	60909	60910	60910	She	212	“ I love this burnished effect . How did you get it ? ”
61434	61447	61419	61419	he	77	“ Oh , how far we ’ve come from the dog throne , ”
61457	61460	61448	61448	Latrisha	137	“ What ? ”
61461	61481	61482	61482	I	2726	“ You ’ve done a one - eighty . From wanting to mess with him to quite the opposite . ”
61492	61499	61482	61482	I	2726	“ What happened to the asshole ? ”
61500	61530	61448	61448	Latrisha	137	“ His company is his family and , yeah , he ’s a complete asshole to anyone who threatens it . Which he saw as me , I suppose — ”
61531	61551	61552	61552	I	2726	“ If he really knew you , he would know you ’re the most trustworthy person on the planet . ”
61771	61784	61767	61767	They	1525	“ We ’ve come to a good place . It ’s complicated . ”
61785	61789	61790	61790	she	1522	“ Record scratch ! ”
61793	61800	61790	61790	she	1522	“ Did you sleep with him ? ”
61801	61804	61815	61815	she	1522	“ Weeeeeell … ”
61805	61814	61815	61815	she	1522	“ Oh - em - eff - gee , ”
61818	61827	61828	61828	I	2726	“ No , we did n’t do it ... ”
61853	61862	61843	61843	his	77	“ But you ’ve been doing each other . ”
61863	61867	61868	61868	I	2726	“ We have . ”
61877	61887	61868	61868	I	2726	“ And it ’s amazing . He ’s amazing . ”
61888	61908	61909	61909	she	1522	“ I thought he did n’t trust you . Like you ’re this weasely scammer who stole his company , ”
61912	61918	61868	61868	I	2726	“ What happened to that ? ”
61919	61954	61868	61868	I	2726	“ We ’ve gotten to know each other — deep down , beneath all the bullshit of this situation . We click . It ’s amazing . And I ’m giving the company back . ”
61955	61962	61868	61868	I	2726	“ Hold on — what ? ! ”
61963	62000	61868	61868	I	2726	“ Do n’t tell him . I did n’t actually tell him , but I implied it . Carly and I have that twenty - one - day waiting period thing and promising is the same … ”
62001	62042	61868	61868	I	2726	“ Bernadette gave it to Smuckers and you because you two were her only friends in the universe . She wanted you to have it . That is your security . You and Carly . You would give that up ? ”
62043	62053	61868	61868	I	2726	“ It does n’t feel right to keep it . ”
62054	62072	61868	61868	I	2726	“ What part of going from scrabbling along to super wealthy does n’t feel right to you ? ”
62073	62103	61868	61868	I	2726	“ All of it . Carly and I were getting on fine . We have a great life just how it is . And the company was never ours . ”
62104	62114	62115	62115	She	1531	“ So , let me get this timeline straight . ”
62129	62195	62123	62123	her	1531	“ He ’s an asshole to you . He plays dirty tricks . It does n’t work . Then he decides to be charming . And we know the tales of him in the sack . I 'm sorry . I know he ’s hot . He ’s smart and fun . But he ’s not one of us . He just wants that company . ”
62202	62208	62209	62209	She	1532	“ No , you listen . ”
62214	62256	62209	62209	She	1532	“ He ’s spending time with you and he ’s all that . And suddenly you ’re handing over the company . You — who hate rich , entitled assholes until this one decides to wrap you around his worldwide cock . ”
62263	62270	62209	62209	She	1532	“ I know how it looks . ”
62271	62281	62282	62282	My	2726	“ Is that or is that not the timeline ? ”
62286	62292	62308	62308	she	1532	“ I do n’t care . ”
62293	62307	62308	62308	she	1532	“ You need to start caring . This rich boy is playing you , ”
62311	62327	62308	62308	she	1532	“ Your first instinct was not to trust him . You need to honor that . ”
62328	62337	62341	62341	me	2726	“ My instinct is to trust him now . ”
62403	62410	62387	62387	Henry	77	“ Do n’t be a fool , ”
62419	62429	62387	62387	Henry	77	“ This guy is leading you by the vajeen . ”
62847	62859	62860	62860	Brett	102	“ I ’ve been trying to call for the last hour , ”
62863	62869	62870	62871	The PI	186	“ Our PI got back . ”
62873	62876	62870	62871	The PI	186	“ Right . ”
62877	62896	62897	62897	I	2726	“ Listen to this — it ’s fake . Extremely professional , extremely expensive , extremely fake identities . ”
62902	62910	62897	62897	I	2726	“ Does he have proof of this ? ”
62911	62965	62870	62871	The PI	186	“ He ’s getting it . It ’s involving bribes at a federal level . There are no photographs of the two of them online prior to seven years ago . He thinks she might be connected . The ID is mob - level good . This is a five - alarm fire . ”
62966	62987	62988	62988	I	2726	“ Mob ? No . She ’s not connected . She ’s not a con . I 'm telling you , ”
62991	63002	63003	63003	Brett	102	“ Has our guy ever been wrong on a case ? ”
63006	63034	63003	63003	Brett	102	“ Has he ? No . Never . Pull your head out of your ass . She posed as a pet whisperer and bilked an old lady . ”
63035	63043	62897	62897	I	2726	“ She ’s giving the company back . ”
63044	63052	62897	62897	I	2726	“ Oh , she told you that ? ”
63053	63059	63003	63003	Brett	102	“ In so many words . ”
63060	63080	63003	63003	Brett	102	“ She ’s giving back the company . But did she do it ? Did she draw up papers ? ”
63081	63105	62897	62897	I	2726	“ I think there ’s more to the will . I do n’t know . She ’s not in it for the money . ”
63106	63120	63003	63003	Brett	102	“ Are you kidding me ? Wait . You ’re sleeping with her . ”
63121	63131	63003	63003	Brett	102	“ No , I ’m telling you what is . ”
63132	63143	62897	62897	I	2726	“ Dude . You do n’t even know her name ! ”
63144	63157	63158	63158	I	2726	“ There could be lots of reasons an ID might be false , ”
63161	63169	63178	63178	he	2726	“ She could be running from somebody . ”
63170	63177	63178	63178	he	2726	“ Yeah , that ’s it , ”
63186	63190	63191	63191	I	2726	“ Screw off , ”
63194	63200	63191	63191	I	2726	“ It ’s under control . ”
63201	63215	63223	63223	I	2726	“ Is this part of good cop ? Is she there or something ? ”
63216	63222	63223	63223	I	2726	“ Let him keep digging , ”
63277	63288	63259	63259	she	1548	“ Go for it . Find out everything about her . ”
63334	63337	63338	63338	he	2726	“ Okay , ”
63342	63354	63338	63338	he	2726	“ And I made ressies at El Capitan for six tomorrow . ”
63355	63358	63338	63338	he	2726	“ What ? ”
63359	63362	63363	63363	Brett	102	“ Dude , ”
63366	63373	63363	63363	Brett	102	“ Scanlund fundraiser ? The Jacabowskis ? ”
63440	63455	63456	63456	I	2726	“ Can I sit there or are you going to hog the whole thing ? ”
63465	63475	63476	63476	I	2726	“ I ’m going to hog the whole thing , ”
63593	63598	63599	63599	she	1552	“ That front desk , ”
63602	63616	63599	63599	she	1552	“ Once the pieces are together ? And with the burnishing ? Right ? ”
63617	63622	63623	63623	I	2726	“ We rocked it , ”
63661	63664	63665	63665	she	1552	“ What ? ”
63668	63671	63672	63672	I	2726	“ Nothing , ”
63675	63694	63672	63672	I	2726	“ But you know , this place would be so much better if it had better shared spaces . ”
63695	63701	63665	63665	she	1552	“ What do you mean ? ”
63702	63710	63711	63711	I	2726	“ This is the only viable couch , ”
63714	63719	63720	63720	She	1552	“ Yeah , well … ”
63763	63858	63755	63755	I	2726	“ Not just a nicer lounge area , but it needs larger and more functional collaboration spaces . The way we all had to crowd into Latrisha ’s area ? No . You could double the workspace if you expanded to the upper level . There could be cots , sleeping rental by the hour , Japanese - hotel style . Hire a manager to oversee the tools and double as a barista and referee , and the stuff you ’d sell would pay their hourly and you ’d have somebody quasi - managing . ”
63922	63927	63928	63928	she	1552	“ That ’s brilliant , ”
63931	63935	63936	63936	She	1552	“ I know . ”
63954	63957	63958	63958	she	1552	“ Seriously , ”
63961	63979	63958	63958	she	1552	“ I do n’t know how you see it . It just comes together in your mind . ”
63980	63986	63987	63987	I	2726	“ It ’s not magic . ”
63995	64003	63987	63987	I	2726	“ Have you seen the other couch ? ”
64004	64008	64009	64009	She	1552	“ Shut it . ”
64035	64039	64024	64024	She	1552	“ You okay ? ”
64040	64043	64048	64048	She	1552	“ Yeah . ”
64044	64047	64048	64048	She	1552	“ Shit . ”
64069	64077	64048	64048	She	1552	“ You should put something on this . ”
64163	64167	64168	64168	She	1552	“ Hold on . ”
64340	64352	64337	64337	She	1552	“ I do n’t want to return to the real world . ”
64370	64379	64380	64383	A couple of guys	1562	“ But Carly’ll be done with rehearsal soon . ”
64420	64427	64413	64413	She	1552	“ What did you just do ? ”
64428	64431	64413	64413	She	1552	“ What ? ”
64432	64450	64413	64413	She	1552	“ Did you go caveman just now with the glare at those guys and the handsy thing ? ”
64451	64454	64455	64455	She	1552	“ Maybe . ”
64458	64465	64455	64455	She	1552	“ You ca n’t do that ! ”
64466	64473	64474	64474	She	1552	“ What ca n’t I do ? ”
64479	64482	64483	64483	I	2726	“ Behave . ”
64491	64495	64496	64496	She	1552	“ Or what ? ”
64501	64531	64496	64496	She	1552	“ I dunno . Maybe I ’ll have all the Cock Worldwide cranes repainted with the face of Smuckers instead of that logo . How would you like that ? ”
64656	64673	64651	64651	She	1552	“ A cartoon picture of Smuckers ’s round little marshmallow head ? Maybe not , huh ? ”
64711	64714	64715	64715	she	1552	“ Kidding , ”
64718	64721	64715	64715	she	1552	“ Really . ”
64753	64764	64744	64744	They	1567	“ Come on , you think I ’d do that ? ”
64765	64776	64744	64744	They	1567	“ I ’m kind of a freak about that logo . ”
64777	64787	64744	64744	They	1567	“ Wait . You think I ’d do that ? ”
64864	64877	64858	64858	They	1564	“ Oh my god . You seriously think I ’d do that ? ”
64878	64888	64889	64889	Her	1552	“ I do n’t know , that ’s all . ”
64898	64920	64921	64921	She	1552	“ How can you not know ? Like I ’m an enemy of the company suddenly ? Like I 'm outside … ”
64925	64930	64921	64921	She	1552	“ Oh my god . ”
64943	64958	64937	64937	her	1552	“ Because , of course , you still wonder if I ’m a scammer . ”
64959	64970	64998	64998	She	1552	“ It ’s not like I ’m standing here wondering … ”
64971	64997	64998	64998	She	1552	“ I told you things would be right . I swore to you . I meant it . Oh my god — I’m so stupid . ”
65017	65022	65011	65012	her sister	1571	“ I ’m coming . ”
65033	65048	65011	65012	her sister	1571	“ Let me give you a ride , at least . Let ’s talk . ”
65049	65058	65059	65059	She	1552	“ I ’ve had enough of your talk . ”
65063	65069	65059	65059	She	1552	“ What are you doing ? ”
65070	65075	65076	65076	she	1552	“ Calling a Lyft , ”
65079	65087	65088	65088	She	1552	“ There ’s one two minutes away . ”
65106	65109	65110	65110	I	2726	“ Vicky . ”
65114	65122	65110	65110	I	2726	“ I ’ll give you a ride . ”
65123	65127	65128	65128	Latrisha	137	“ Not happening . ”
65186	65195	65174	65174	She	297	“ I ’m asking you to not follow . ”
65402	65418	65399	65399	I	2726	“ Why are the coolest looking hunks of rebar - wrapped concrete always the heaviest ? ”
65419	65427	65399	65399	I	2726	“ Somebody would help you with it . ”
65428	65435	65436	65436	I	2726	“ I want to do it . ”
65464	65469	65470	65470	she	297	“ I met her , ”
65481	65484	65470	65470	she	297	“ Who ? ”
65485	65498	65499	65499	I	2726	“ Bernadette . Your mother . She was mean about my hair . ”
65525	65534	65470	65470	she	297	“ She had a hard time being nice . ”
65535	65552	65470	65470	she	297	“ That ’s what you call it ? Is that how she always was to people ? ”
65553	65559	65470	65470	she	297	“ To people . Yeah . ”
65570	65585	65470	65470	she	297	“ She was like that to Vicky . A complete bitch about her clothes . ”
65586	65600	65601	65601	I	2726	“ That ’s what you get when you sign up for Team Bernadette , ”
65604	65677	65678	65678	I	2726	“ You think she signed up for Team Bernadette ? Dude , your mom stalked her . She pursued her , manipulated her . Vicky did everything she could to avoid that woman , but she wheedled into her life and Vicky took pity on her and she made sure she was safe and all of that . And now here you are , screwing with her , too . Lay off . ”
65681	65687	65678	65678	I	2726	“ My mom pursued Vicky ? ”
65688	65704	65705	65705	I	2726	“ Your mother literally harassed her , demanding she talk to Smuckers after the fair . ”
65708	65712	65705	65705	I	2726	“ What fair ? ”
65713	65717	65718	65718	Latrisha	137	“ The fair ? ”
65721	65822	65718	65718	Latrisha	137	“ Where she volunteered to fill in for the pet whisperer ? Do you not even know this story ? That ’s how they met . Vicky was there selling those bow ties , and the person who was being pet whisperer or whatever did n’t show up . They had some booth or something . So Vicky volunteered to do it . They put this ridiculous outfit on her . And your mother comes along and Vicky ’s like , Smuckers enjoys hearing you sing , and your mother was convinced she had dog whisperer powers from then on . ”
65829	65837	65718	65718	Latrisha	137	“ That ’s how it all started ? ”
65838	65870	65718	65718	Latrisha	137	“ I ca n’t believe you do n’t know . Did you care to even ask ? Or were you too busy listening to Coldplay and shopping for tartan plaid scarves ? ”
65871	65878	65879	65879	My	2726	“ What are you talking about ? ”
65906	65909	65910	65910	I	2726	“ Singing , ”
65913	66001	66002	66002	I	2726	“ Does n't everyone sing in front of their pet ? That ’s what Vicky said . And they ’d run into each other by accident after that , and your mom would be all , You have to tell me what Smuckers is thinking ! Offering her money and stuff . And Vicky would insist she was n’t a pet whisperer , insist there ’s no such thing . Your mom thought Vicky was withholding her psychic gift from her . Out of spite or something . ”
66005	66011	66012	66012	Bernadette	1007	“ Of course she would . ”
66022	66090	66091	66091	Latrisha	137	“ Vicky and Carly would run into your mom a lot after that , mostly on this bench they ’d pass every day going to Carly ’s school . They wondered if she was stalking them . Your mom would hit Vicky up for readings but she ’d refuse . And then this one day your mother was all dizzy and faint . It was hot out … ”
66680	66692	66693	66693	I	2726	“ Vicky , are you in there ? I messed up , ”
66696	66701	66702	66702	I	2726	“ I ’m sorry . ”
66822	66829	66830	66830	I	2726	“ Not in the dancing mood , ”
67052	67056	67057	67057	I	2726	“ Brett’ll dance , ”
67251	67257	67260	67260	him	102	“ The Ten is transitional , ”
67262	67286	67287	67287	Translation	230	“ It ’s forward - looking , yes , but I ’m taking things much further now that I ’m moving into leadership . ”
67305	67315	67287	67287	Translation	230	“ Once you take over leadership from the dog ? ”
67316	67327	67328	67328	I	2726	“ Yeah , once I take over from the dog , ”
67332	67345	67328	67328	I	2726	“ You guys actually did a stock transfer . That ’s ballsy . ”
67346	67358	67359	67359	I	2726	“ He really is in charge . He and his advocate . ”
67362	67387	67388	67388	Jana	226	“ We ’re doing our best to guide him . Smuckers would be putting fire hydrants all over Manhattan if he had his way . ”
67391	67401	67388	67388	Jana	226	“ The dog has more vision than some builders . ”
67525	67528	67512	67512	Renaldo	1007	“ Henry ! ”
67529	67538	67539	67540	the man	1007	“ He was telling me about the Ten , ”
67565	67568	67569	67569	I	2726	“ Jonah , ”
67648	67656	67642	67642	I	2726	“ So what ’s really going on ? ”
67667	67680	67657	67657	Renaldo	1007	“ I screwed up . I did n’t go with my gut . ”
67681	67685	67686	67686	he	1007	“ Tell me , ”
67768	67774	67775	67775	I	2726	“ You would love it , ”
67778	67802	67775	67775	I	2726	“ Spending just that time with her without all the bullshit , that was amazing . We were amazing . She ’s special . ”
67839	67846	67836	67836	he	1007	“ Ouch . A dog face ? ”
67847	67884	67885	67885	He	1007	“ I did n’t have to let it mess me up . Like I could n’t be strong for the firm and open - minded about her at the same time ? I had to react . ”
67891	67894	67895	67895	I	2726	“ What ? ”
67898	67904	67905	67905	he	1007	“ She hit your button , ”
67908	67919	67905	67905	he	1007	“ Do n’t be so hard on yourself , Henry . ”
67933	68012	67920	67920	I	2726	“ Your mother was a crazy bitch . She dedicated her life to smashing every sand castle you managed to build . My picture of your childhood is you sitting on the front stoop of your mansion , clutching that bear of yours , crying your eyes out because she ’d left . Yet again . Bernadette was a narcissistic gold digger who blamed you for everything . And your father did n’t do shit to correct that . ”
68013	68017	68018	68018	I	2726	“ Do n’t , ”
68021	68026	68027	68027	He	1647	“ That ’s enough . ”
68037	68059	68060	68060	Pokey	69	“ Yet you always wanted her love . You ’d follow her around . Remember how she always called you Pokey ? ”
68067	68076	68062	68062	Her	69	“ I never could keep up with her . ”
68077	68089	68090	68090	I	2726	“ Of course you could n’t . You were a child . ”
68093	68114	68090	68090	I	2726	“ I 'm glad for how she was . She taught me to be strong , to rely on myself . ”
68115	68130	68131	68131	I	2726	“ You ’ve never been a liar , Henry . Do n’t start now . ”
68147	68150	68142	68142	Renaldo	1007	“ What ? ”
68151	68154	68155	68155	He	2726	“ Please . ”
68160	68229	68230	68230	I	2726	“ Like you do n’t care . You loved her and she broke your heart . These last few years , I know the Christmas gifts you ’d send her would come back unopened . The cards returned , the calls unanswered . You never stopped trying to be a good son to her . You did n’t want to be made strong . You wanted a relationship . ”
68240	68292	68233	68233	He	2726	“ I watched you build this company , even with Kaleb blocking your best ideas . You sweat blood for this company . These people . Then your mother comes along and gives a strange woman absolute power over it . A woman who has zero reasons to care about it . ”
68311	68330	68305	68305	I	2726	“ Vicky ’s starting to care about it . She ’s starting to get what we ’re doing . ”
68331	68336	68337	68337	Renaldo	1007	“ Not the point . ”
68345	68385	68337	68337	Renaldo	1007	“ She makes a joke about repainting the cranes in some ridiculous image ? That ’s what your mother would do . Except she ’d actually do it . You believed the worst because how else could it be ? ”
68386	68395	68305	68305	I	2726	“ I acted like she was my mother . ”
68396	68400	68401	68401	he	1007	“ Your button , ”
68404	68416	68401	68401	he	1007	“ I need to apologize . I need to tell her … ”
68421	68427	68401	68401	he	1007	“ Do it , then . ”
68428	68444	68337	68337	Renaldo	1007	“ She wo n’t see me . She wo n’t answer my calls and texts . ”
68445	68459	68401	68401	he	1007	“ Think of something . You ’re Henry fucking Locke , for crissake . ”
68602	68610	68611	68611	I	2726	“ It never would ’ve lasted anyway , ”
68833	68840	68841	68841	I	2726	“ I thought you were sleeping , ”
68844	68850	68841	68841	I	2726	“ I sort of was . ”
68851	68856	68857	68857	I	2726	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
68860	68863	68864	68864	she	297	“ Nothing , ”
68867	68870	68871	68871	I	2726	“ What ? ”
68931	68941	68928	68928	I	2726	“ What is this ? Is this last night ? ”
68958	68975	68976	68976	she	297	“ It means nothing . Rich guys have to go to a lot of those things , ”
68979	68987	68988	68988	I	2726	“ It ’s part of being rich . ”
69010	69040	68999	68999	I	2726	“ I do n’t know how to feel about you knowing so much about the lifestyle of the rich and famous . It ’s a useless thing to study . ”
69063	69070	69071	69071	Carly	470	“ That girl got a dance , ”
69076	69082	69071	69071	Carly	470	“ You got a company . ”
69083	69102	69103	69103	I	2726	“ Is it stupid - amount - of - candy - in - ice - cream time yet ? ”
69109	69125	69106	69106	She	297	“ For breakfast ? Do n’t bluff , I might take you up on it . ”
69134	69137	69106	69106	She	297	“ Tonight . ”
69175	69178	69179	69179	I	2726	“ Uh , ”
69189	69205	69179	69179	I	2726	“ Are n’t you going to open it ? Do n’t you want to see ? ”
69206	69236	69179	69179	I	2726	“ I already know what ’s in it . It ’s whatever rich guys think they can use to buy anything and anyone . I do n’t want it . ”
69237	69244	69179	69179	I	2726	“ Maybe it ’s something nice . ”
69245	69252	69253	69253	She	297	“ I do n’t want it . ”
69257	69263	69264	69264	She	297	“ Can I open it ? ”
69268	69273	69264	69264	She	297	“ Light as air . ”
69274	69282	69179	69179	I	2726	“ You need to toss that package . ”
69283	69289	69264	69264	She	297	“ Without even looking inside ? ”
69290	69296	69297	69297	I	2726	“ Without even looking inside , ”
69620	69626	69627	69627	She	470	“ You can open it . ”
69630	69639	69627	69627	She	470	“ You asked me to throw it away . ”
69640	69645	69646	69646	She	470	“ Go get it . ”
69651	69665	69646	69646	She	470	“ I ’m sure the trash man ’s hauled it off by now . ”
69666	69673	69674	69674	Carly	470	“ Yeah . Go get it . ”
69709	69714	69702	69702	I	2726	“ You do it . ”
69715	69723	69724	69724	She	470	“ I thought you ’d never ask . ”
69744	69748	69749	69749	she	470	“ A box , ”
69759	69779	69749	69749	she	470	“ A really , really nice box of tag board . I wonder why he got you a box . ”
69780	69788	69789	69789	She	470	“ Stop it ! Stop screwing around . ”
69827	69830	69831	69831	I	2726	“ What ? ”
69834	69839	69831	69831	I	2726	“ Oh my god . ”
69851	69858	69831	69831	I	2726	“ Oh . My . God ! ”
69859	69862	69871	69871	she	470	“ What ? ”
69863	69870	69871	69871	she	470	“ Wait . Close your eyes , ”
69879	69884	69874	69874	I	2726	“ Now open them . ”
69934	69939	69940	69940	Carly	470	“ He ’s beautiful , ”
69974	69984	69959	69959	he	1162	“ He got somebody to make our griffin friend . ”
69985	69991	69992	69992	I	2726	“ He made it himself , ”
69995	70029	69992	69992	I	2726	“ He got up there somehow and got some photos , and he carved it . This is all Henry — this vision . The passion of it . The way he knew . ”
70030	70037	70040	70040	I	2726	“ You ’re quite the expert . ”
70044	70050	70051	70051	She	470	“ There ’s a card . ”
70245	70248	70249	70249	She	127	“ Hey ! ”
70259	70267	70249	70249	She	127	“ We did n’t expect you guys . ”
70268	70273	70278	70278	she	127	“ Where is everyone ? ”
70274	70277	70278	70278	she	127	“ Queens , ”
70292	70296	70278	70278	she	127	“ The Ten ? ”
70297	70303	70249	70249	She	127	“ Is something going on ? ”
70304	70309	70310	70310	Her	127	“ The emergency meeting ? ”
70315	70321	70310	70310	Her	127	“ You do n’t know ? ”
70322	70325	70278	70278	she	127	“ No . ”
70326	70360	70361	70361	I	2726	“ They carried on as if you knew . I assumed you did n’t want to come — it ’s more detail than you usually get into . It ’s an emergency meeting . ”
70370	70379	70361	70361	I	2726	“ Well , let ’s get a car . ”
70406	70412	70413	70413	April	127	“ It came up fast , ”
70416	70427	70413	70413	April	127	“ The project is in jeopardy . It ’s bad . ”
70428	70432	70413	70413	April	127	“ What happened ? ”
70433	70446	70413	70413	April	127	“ Dartford & Sons . They ’re blowhards . Total asshole developers . ”
70447	70458	70459	70459	She	127	“ So I ’ve heard . What ’d they do ? ”
70467	70520	70459	70459	She	127	“ Here ’s the thing with a development like the Ten — if Locke tells the neighbors about their plans before they ’ve bought up all the properties , word will leak and a competitor will buy one key lot and hold it hostage . Dartford & Sons is notorious for that . ”
70521	70534	70413	70413	April	127	“ So Dartford bought a lot in the middle of the Ten ? ”
70535	70599	70459	70459	She	127	“ No — we just closed on the last property , so the Dartford brothers ca n’t wreck it that way . Instead , they poisoned the neighbors against it . Acted like Locke has been doing things in secret . They ’ll get the councilperson to veto the project , make the land worthless , then try and get a racetrack through . ”
70600	70609	70610	70610	I	2726	“ Who wants a racetrack in their neighborhood ? ”
70613	70636	70610	70610	I	2726	“ Nobody , but the Dartford brothers’ll bribe and lie their way into projects . They cross lines most people wo n’t . ”
70857	70859	70855	70855	him	77	“ on ”
71054	71057	71051	71051	he	77	“ Hi . ”
71077	71080	71081	71081	I	2726	“ Hi , ”
71165	71172	71173	71173	April	127	“ Those guys are Dartford plants , ”
71176	71221	71173	71173	April	127	“ Planted in the audience to sink this project . They ’ll complain about the amount of greenery , which always rallies people . And they ’ll complain about the lack of public input — which they would actually get more of with Locke . ”
71259	71264	71265	71265	I	2726	“ This is bad , ”
71268	71324	71265	71265	I	2726	“ It is . Once those assholes have their no vote , they ’ll bribe some council people and put their racetrack in . But we ca n’t say that , because it has n’t happened yet . Once it ’s done it ’s too late . They have people , let ’s just say . ”
71359	71362	71363	71363	April	127	“ Lies , ”
71366	71381	71363	71363	April	127	“ Their motto should be Where doing the wrong thing is the right thing . ”
71451	71464	71465	71466	The man	1007	“ One question — are you being paid by Dartford & Sons ? ”
71494	71503	71490	71490	April	127	“ Why are they listening to those jerks ? ”
71526	71536	71537	71537	she	127	“ There ’s no more yes in the room , ”
71541	71551	71552	71552	She	127	“ Dartford & Sons are officially sinking the Ten . ”
71557	71585	71586	71586	I	2726	“ These neighbors are going to get screwed . And it ’s Henry ’s birthday next week , and all he ’ll get is the final dissolution … ”
71629	71636	71619	71621	the Dartford guy	1724	“ Oh , this is perfect , ”
71644	71657	71619	71621	the Dartford guy	1724	“ Is this the dog ? The new owner of Locke Worldwide ? ”
71658	71667	71668	71668	April	127	“ No , no , no , no , ”
71674	71677	71668	71668	April	127	“ Shit . ”
71764	71768	71769	71769	he	1724	“ Tell me , ”
71776	71787	71788	71788	He	1724	“ can you trust a company led by a dog ? ”
71793	71863	71864	71864	He	1724	“ You ’re the dog ’s keeper ? Do n’t you think this is a little reckless for a publicity stunt ? To literally hand control of a company to a dog and his keeper ? This dog legally controls the entire firm , does he not ? This dog could sell the company for a dollar to a kid on the street . Is that a trustworthy move ? ”
71907	71912	71903	71903	He	102	“ Leave her alone . ”
71913	71922	71923	71923	Dartford	232	“ You have anything to say for yourself ? ”
71970	71974	71975	71975	Dartford	232	“ Come on , ”
72012	72023	72010	72010	Vonda	90	“ The leader of the company has nothing to say ? ”
72057	72082	72044	72044	I	2726	“ Does the leader of the company have anything to say ? You want to know ? Well , how about it , Smuckers ? ”
72092	72097	72098	72098	I	2726	“ Oh , dear , ”
72106	72122	72101	72101	I	2726	“ Smuckers says he is so sick of your shit . He ca n’t even . ”
72135	72139	72140	72140	Dartford	232	“ Very amusing , ”
72204	72238	72197	72197	I	2726	“ Smuckers here thought he was going to a nice community meeting where we talk about making a neighborhood nicer , but instead , it ’s battle of the jerky titans . Please . ”
72246	72250	72251	72253	The Dartford guy	419	“ Very funny . ”
72282	72290	72291	72291	I	2726	“ Is Smuckers in charge of this ? ”
72298	72379	72291	72291	I	2726	“ Right now he is . This guy ’s right . A dog is literally in charge of a worldwide development and finance company . Here ’s the thing . Smuckers agrees with a lot of you about more green space , not less . He thinks so many buildings are just huge pieces of shit — new ones are the worst . Maybe they win awards , but seriously ? Smuckers believes in human- and dog - centered design . ”
72385	72390	72383	72383	Somebody	439	“ More fire hydrants ! ”
72391	72398	72399	72399	Kaleb	292	“ Nobody ’s redesigning this project , ”
72402	72408	72399	72399	Kaleb	292	“ That ’s not happening . ”
72414	72436	72409	72409	I	2726	“ Why ca n’t we ? Smuckers does n’t understand . Why ca n’t it be nicer , like a garden ? ”
72448	72463	72464	72464	Kaleb	292	“ Because it took a year to design , and that phase is over , ”
72467	72489	72490	72492	A few people	1518	“ Smuckers does n’t understand . If people do n’t like it , why not make a new design ? Right ? ”
72495	72500	72501	72501	Kaleb	292	“ We ca n’t , ”
72522	72574	72510	72510	I	2726	“ But here ’s the thing . Smuckers hates racetracks . He thinks they ’re messy and noisy and bring a lot of traffic and are horrible in a residential area , and he knows you guys are going to put it in . I mean , seriously ? A racetrack ? ”
72575	72583	72501	72501	Kaleb	292	“ We ’re planning no such thing . ”
72584	72621	72510	72510	I	2726	“ Smuckers says that everyone in the building community knows you are . You tried to get one in on Brockton Greens , right ? You have partners looking with you . Is n’t that right ? ”
72622	72634	72510	72510	I	2726	“ I do n’t know what ridiculous rumors you ’ve heard . ”
72635	72658	72659	72659	Dartford	232	“ Smuckers wants to know if you ’d sign a thing right here swearing you would n’t ever build a racetrack here . ”
72677	72682	72683	72683	He	232	“ This is silly . ”
72700	72727	72689	72689	I	2726	“ What is that , Smuckers ? You think it ’s suspicious they wo n’t sign a thing like that ? I think so , too ! ”
72736	72754	72764	72764	he	102	“ Henry , Smuckers wants you to put up that slide of the neighborhood - facing structure . ”
72755	72763	72764	72764	he	102	“ We ’re done with that slide , ”
72767	72775	72776	72776	I	2726	“ Smuckers wants to see it again , ”
72779	72785	72786	72786	Henry	102	“ We ’ve seen it , ”
72789	72796	72797	72797	I	2726	“ Smuckers wants it put up . ”
72845	72852	72853	72853	I	2726	“ Let ’s make it amazing , ”
72856	72872	72853	72853	I	2726	“ More green , less building . We can do that , right , Henry ? ”
72900	72904	72905	72905	he	102	“ We can , ”
72908	72918	72905	72905	he	102	“ That ’s not really the question , though ... ”
72919	72925	72926	72926	Kaleb	292	“ There are cost issues , ”
72929	72944	72926	72926	Kaleb	292	“ With every square foot lost , the cost of the remaining goes up . ”
72945	72954	72955	72955	I	2726	“ So what if the cost goes up ? ”
72958	72995	72955	72955	I	2726	“ If it ’s cool . Let ’s see options . Something will have to go in to replace the factories that are moving out . What does it look like if it ’s something better ? ”
73107	73119	73120	73120	he	102	“ How about this . We could integrate something like this , ”
73123	73138	73120	73120	he	102	“ This landscape is brown . Imagine it full of greenery and natural light . ”
73147	73179	73180	73180	He	102	“ Look how the natural light flows . And this gathering space . We can do this . We can have this . We ’d do benches along here . Greenery . ”
73392	73400	73401	73401	he	238	“ Let ’s get out of here , ”
73419	73422	73410	73410	He	238	“ Now . ”
73423	73428	73401	73401	he	238	“ I can carry ... ”
73429	73434	73435	73435	He	238	“ I got it . ”
73480	73486	73487	73487	I	2726	“ I got your gift , ”
73490	73503	73504	73504	He	238	“ It ’s the most beautiful thing anyone ever made for me . ”
73648	73651	73652	73652	he	238	“ Goddamn , ”
73722	73726	73727	73727	he	238	“ The hell , ”
73730	73756	73727	73727	he	238	“ How did I not believe you ? How did I not trust you ? All this time — god , I was an asshole . ”
73757	73770	73787	73787	Henry	102	“ It was a lot to ask , that level of trust . ”
73771	73778	73779	73779	My	2726	“ Not when it ’s you . ”
73802	73848	73849	73849	I	2726	“ I did n’t listen to what I knew about you . You ’re amazing and beautiful , and you take my breath away . And you said things will turn out . You gave me your word . It ’s good enough for me . ”
73857	73865	73849	73849	I	2726	“ The circumstances are what they are . ”
73866	73873	73874	73874	I	2726	“ To hell with the circumstances . ”
73888	73892	73874	73874	I	2726	“ Thank you . ”
73915	73921	73922	73922	I	2726	“ He has to pee , ”
73925	73932	73922	73922	I	2726	“ But not on flat pavement . ”
73933	73940	73941	73941	Henry	102	“ So . Freaking . Romantic . ”
73949	73955	73941	73941	Henry	102	“ Come on , boy . ”
73967	73971	73972	73972	he	102	“ So romantic , ”
73975	73981	73982	73982	I	2726	“ You ’re not mad ? ”
73993	73998	73999	73999	He	102	“ About the meeting ? ”
74012	74015	73999	73999	He	102	“ Mad ? ”
74016	74025	73999	73999	He	102	“ From me doing the Smuckers says thing ? ”
74026	74074	74075	74075	I	2726	“ Baby , I have spent a lot of time on the wrong end of the Smuckers says thing . I have not enjoyed it . In fact , you could say I ’ve pretty much hated it . Could n’t wait to be free of it . ”
74078	74088	74089	74089	He	102	“ But seeing the Dartford brothers victimized by it ? ”
74101	74104	74093	74093	He	102	“ Priceless . ”
74159	74170	74171	74171	he	102	“ Here ’s something else I need to tell you , ”
74174	74195	74171	74171	he	102	“ You made that joke , and I know you were being funny , and I reacted like an idiot . ”
74196	74203	74171	74171	he	102	“ You care about the company — ”
74204	74223	74224	74224	He	102	“ No , I know you would n’t do something like that , paint the cranes like that . ”
74248	74252	74253	74254	The driver	1146	“ Thank you . ”
74258	74287	74253	74254	The driver	1146	“ Painting the cranes ? That ’s a move my mother would make . And it sent me down a rabbit hole of fuckedupness that you said it . ”
74303	74315	74316	74316	He	1146	“ I get why you cut her out of your life . ”
74319	74330	74316	74316	He	1146	“ You think I cut her out of my life ? ”
74331	74342	74253	74254	The driver	1146	“ She was always talking like you did , like — ”
74343	74387	74316	74316	He	1146	“ Vicky , she cut me out . She did n’t want to see family . Her doormen had instructions to turn me away . You think I did n’t try to see her ? At least get her out of that shithole ? ”
74388	74391	74392	74392	I	2726	“ Right , ”
74411	74442	74392	74392	I	2726	“ I ca n’t believe I did n’t put that together . I mean , you ’re the most loyal person I ’ve ever met . I should ’ve realized . ”
74443	74450	74451	74451	He	1763	“ Bernadette talked a good game . ”
74465	74470	74392	74392	I	2726	“ I 'm sorry . ”
74471	74478	74479	74479	he	1763	“ Oh , do n’t be , ”
74482	74503	74479	74479	he	1763	“ She knew how to have fun , how to make you feel like the only person in the world . ”
74523	74530	74531	74531	I	2726	“ But it would n’t last , ”
74551	74563	74564	74564	I	2726	“ And it ’s worse when that goodness is taken away , ”
74623	74643	74644	74644	He	1763	“ My mom was great when she was off drugs . But when she was on ? Not pretty . ”
74647	74653	74644	74644	He	1763	“ She was on drugs ? ”
74654	74657	74658	74658	I	2726	“ Meth , ”
74661	74683	74658	74658	I	2726	“ And there were things she did when she was desperate for money , for another buy , the deepest betrayals . ”
74765	74793	74794	74794	He	1763	“ Much as I had cause not to trust Mom , I ’d always think things would be different the next time around . I always hoped . ”
74816	74830	74808	74808	He	1763	“ The last betrayal was the biggest . You would n’t even believe . ”
74831	74838	74839	74839	he	1763	“ And then your parents died , ”
74842	74851	74852	74852	My	2726	“ And you were alone with your sister . ”
74892	74900	74901	74901	he	1763	“ And you had to leave Prescott , ”
74918	74924	74925	74925	he	1763	“ But you made it , ”
74928	74933	74925	74925	he	1763	“ More or less . ”
74941	74944	74945	74945	I	2726	“ Hey , ”
74950	74963	74945	74945	I	2726	“ April said it was almost your birthday . Happy early birthday . ”
74964	74972	74973	74973	he	1763	“ I do n’t celebrate my birthday , ”
74976	74979	74973	74973	he	1763	“ Why ? ”
74980	74986	74987	74987	He	1763	“ I just do n’t . ”
75010	75013	75014	75014	He	1763	“ Okay . ”
75037	75053	75054	75054	My	2726	“ So , FYI , no birthdays . Now that you ’re in my life . ”
75258	75265	75266	75266	I	2726	“ But your birthday is soon ? ”
75269	75285	75266	75266	I	2726	“ I want nothing to do with it . It ’s a thing with me . ”
75286	75296	75297	75297	I	2726	“ Fine . Your birthday is just another day , ”
75300	75305	75306	75306	he	1763	“ Say it again , ”
75314	75321	75306	75306	he	1763	“ Just . Another . Day . ”
75723	75727	75728	75728	I	2726	“ One question , ”
75731	75769	75728	75728	I	2726	“ And you need to answer honestly . What is up with the Dartford brothers ? Do they just sit around rubbing their hands and dreaming of building what people most do n’t want them to build ? ”
75770	75780	75787	75787	I	2726	“ And then laugh maniacally ? Something like that . ”
75781	75786	75787	75787	I	2726	“ They were mad , ”
75790	75801	75787	75787	I	2726	“ I ’m glad people could see they were jerks . ”
75802	75813	75814	75814	Henry	77	“ It was n’t just showing them up as jerks , ”
75817	75881	75814	75814	Henry	77	“ It was how you were . You have to understand , at these meetings , usually there ’s nobody on the side of the everyday people . I think they sense their powerlessness sometimes . Then you step in with the Smuckers thing , and it was brilliant . And you were on their side , and they knew it was genuine . ”
75882	75893	75728	75728	I	2726	“ They should ’ve known you were on their side . ”
75894	76029	75814	75814	Henry	77	“ Yeah , I ’m still the developer . Whereas the way you blazed in , you were their ally . I think Brett and Kaleb are going to need months to recover . Shit . Kaleb ’s protests ? We could n’t have staged it better if we tried . Like we ’d written a script for him . It could n’t have been better . It really was like a dog is pushing everyone around , which I guess it was . It ’s the most bizarre thing I ’ve seen in all my years in business . You and Smuckers did what we could n’t do in an hour of yelling — you made them open their minds and listen . You opened the door to a redesign of the Ten . ”
76030	76036	76037	76037	He	1779	“ That you thought of . ”
76052	76057	76058	76058	he	1779	“ God , Vicky , ”
76061	76068	76058	76058	he	1779	“ Battle of the jerky titans ? ”
76069	76072	76073	76073	My	2726	“ Umm … ”
76077	76093	76094	76094	I	2726	“ You do n’t like rich , entitled guys . That ’s what I think . ”
76103	76114	76115	76115	he	1779	“ I do n’t want to be that to you , ”
76118	76133	76134	76134	He	1779	“ Though I did try to trick you and make you sign everything away . ”
76142	76149	76150	76150	I	2726	“ And you got me arrested , ”
76153	76163	76164	76164	he	1779	“ Detained . Still — I’m sorry about that , ”
76167	76174	76164	76164	he	1779	“ Oh , you should be . ”
76226	76233	76218	76218	He	1779	“ Well , to be fair , ”
76238	76260	76234	76234	I	2726	“ I did put a dog throne in your boardroom and make you talk to Smuckers as if he were human . ”
76261	76266	76267	76267	he	1779	“ I hated it , ”
76270	76286	76287	76287	He	1779	“ But I kind of admired it , in a what the hell ! way . ”
76307	76323	76301	76301	his	1779	“ I did n’t know what was up or down . When you did that . ”
76341	76349	76350	76350	I	2726	“ Brett seemed kind of angry tonight , ”
76353	76361	76362	76362	Henry	102	“ I do n’t care about Brett , ”
76402	76407	76408	76408	He	102	“ Where are we ? ”
76413	76423	76408	76408	He	102	“ We ’re going to my place , Vicky . ”
76424	76429	76408	76408	He	102	“ Just like that ? ”
76430	76435	76436	76436	My	2726	“ Just like that . ”
76452	76459	76443	76443	I	2726	“ Now who ’s being entitled ? ”
76460	76470	76471	76471	His	102	“ Carly has a sleepover — April told me . ”
76483	76489	76490	76490	He	102	“ I do n’t know . ”
76507	76511	76512	76512	He	102	“ You do . ”
76521	76525	76512	76512	He	102	“ So entitled . ”
76538	76548	76512	76512	He	102	“ You think you can get whatever you want ? ”
76549	76555	76556	76556	he	102	“ Come home with me , ”
76562	76576	76556	76556	he	102	“ I ca n’t . It ’s not just my responsibility to Carly ... ”
76577	76584	76585	76585	he	102	“ I ’m tired of responsibilities , ”
76588	76605	76585	76585	he	102	“ Let ’s forget them for a while . Be two people without any of it . ”
76664	76677	76661	76661	I	2726	“ Sounds to me like you ’re suggesting a dirty role play . ”
76678	76682	76683	76683	he	102	“ The opposite , ”
76686	76704	76683	76683	he	102	“ I ’m suggesting us without the roles and responsibilities . We leave them in this car . ”
76804	76810	76795	76795	I	2726	“ What are you doing ? ”
76922	76926	76927	76927	he	102	“ Now you , ”
76930	76941	76927	76927	he	102	“ Leave something behind . It ’ll just be us . ”
77004	77020	76994	76994	I	2726	“ Sorry , buddy , looks like you ’re spending the night in the car . ”
77036	77039	77057	77057	he	102	“ This . ”
77046	77052	77057	77057	he	102	“ You want my hair ? ”
77053	77056	77057	77057	he	102	“ Shut , ”
77063	77066	77057	77057	he	102	“ it . ”
77087	77091	77092	77092	He	102	“ Stay still . ”
77255	77261	77241	77241	him	102	“ Put out your hand . ”
77392	77397	77398	77399	the doorman	1797	“ Who ’s this ? ”
77423	77428	77429	77429	I	2726	“ It ’s Smuckers , ”
77533	77539	77540	77540	Henry	1797	“ How ’s it going ? ”
77544	77549	77550	77551	the doorman	1797	“ Fine and dandy , ”
77559	77566	77550	77551	the doorman	1797	“ Look at you , mister ! ”
77591	77594	77578	77578	Henry	1797	“ Sorry . ”
77607	77614	77615	77615	I	2726	“ Will he have a problem , ”
77618	77629	77615	77615	I	2726	“ if we make out on the floor over there ? ”
77630	77636	77637	77637	Henry	1797	“ Come on , Smuck . ”
77642	77649	77650	77650	he	1007	“ See ya later , Alan , ”
77739	77763	77764	77764	Henry	1797	“ Some fancy action right here . If I ’d ’ve known , I would ’ve put Smuckers in his silver bow tie . ”
77826	77829	77808	77808	His	2530	“ Yes , ”
78101	78111	78092	78092	he	2530	“ I want you so bad I could die , ”
78160	78176	78142	78142	he	2530	“ Maybe you should stab some buttons a few times . Get this thing going . ”
78177	78184	78185	78185	he	2530	“ Nobody ’s stabbing any buttons , ”
78216	78230	78231	78231	he	2530	“ You were supposed to leave your hands up there against the wall , ”
78234	78243	78244	78244	I	2726	“ My hands are in a misbehaving mood , ”
78314	78318	78304	78304	he	2530	“ These skirts . ”
78330	78338	78323	78323	he	2530	“ You kill me all the time . ”
78339	78354	78355	78355	He	2530	“ Henry . We ’re in an elevator . What if somebody comes in ? ”
78397	78431	78432	78432	He	2530	“ You see me put in that code ? That code takes this thing directly to the top floor , which is my floor . This is my front door we ’re in . ”
78436	78440	78441	78441	He	2530	“ My doorway . ”
78455	78458	78441	78441	He	2530	“ Mine . ”
78596	78599	78600	78600	he	2530	“ Uh , ”
78608	78614	78600	78600	he	2530	“ Get it off you . ”
78622	78630	78631	78631	He	2530	“ No , no , hell no . ”
78637	78647	78631	78631	He	2530	“ Keep it on . Just pull it up . ”
78648	78657	78658	78658	My	2726	“ You like when it ’s pulled up . ”
78674	78678	78679	78679	He	2530	“ Do it . ”
78717	78727	78728	78728	I	2726	“ You have to do it nice and neat , ”
78731	78741	78728	78728	I	2726	“ Or it does n’t get done at all . ”
78800	78808	78790	78790	he	2530	“ Jesus , you ’re so hot . ”
78866	78870	78858	78858	Smuckers	1007	“ Smuckers just … ”
78871	78878	78879	78879	His	2530	“ Let him destroy the place . ”
78895	78905	78888	78888	His	2530	“ Let him set the whole planet on fire . ”
78906	78919	78920	78920	My	2726	“ Well , you have quite the low opinion of poor Smu — ”
78955	78961	78962	78962	He	2530	“ You are so wet . ”
78981	78994	78995	78995	He	2530	“ You kill me . You kill me with your secret hotness . ”
79000	79003	78995	78995	He	2530	“ Up . ”
79136	79143	79144	79144	he	2530	“ Vicky , Vicky , Vicky , ”
79179	79185	79186	79186	he	2530	“ I have needed this , ”
79189	79194	79186	79186	he	2530	“ so damn long . ”
79202	79215	79195	79195	His	2530	“ So damn long . I have needed this for so long . ”
79293	79300	79281	79281	He	2530	“ Please , Henry , please . ”
79317	79331	79332	79332	He	2530	“ I did n’t know a tongue could do so many … shapes . ”
79359	79371	79372	79372	he	2530	“ That ’s what you ’re getting out of all this ? ”
79375	79384	79372	79372	he	2530	“ The wonderful world of the human tongue ? ”
79385	79393	79405	79405	He	2530	“ No ! Please , go back ! ”
79394	79404	79405	79405	He	2530	“ I love how wet you are for me . ”
79433	79440	79429	79429	I	2726	“ You have to go back . ”
79447	79450	79429	79429	I	2726	“ Please . ”
79451	79460	79461	79461	I	2726	“ You ’re even hotter begging like this . ”
79466	79469	79461	79461	I	2726	“ Please . ”
79568	79571	79552	79552	he	2530	“ Oh , ”
79679	79721	79672	79672	he	2530	“ We ’re going in there , baby , and I ’m going to strip you naked and fuck the daylights out of you . I ’m going to fuck you like there ’s no tomorrow . You good with that ? ”
79873	79879	79880	79880	I	2726	“ Where ’re you going ? ”
79904	79911	79912	79912	he	2530	“ I never feel like this , ”
79918	79951	79912	79912	he	2530	“ I never feel this messed up . Your skirt was an engineering problem I should ’ve understood , but I felt like … a bear . My hands like a bear . ”
79952	79957	79912	79912	he	2530	“ I liked it . ”
79958	79975	79912	79912	he	2530	“ I ’m serious . You ’re all I could think about , all these weeks . ”
79976	79981	79982	79982	I	2726	“ Me , too , ”
79985	79997	79998	79998	I	2726	“ I watch you . I try not to want you , ”
80011	80019	80001	80001	He	2530	“ You always have these under there ? ”
80020	80024	80025	80025	I	2726	“ Kind of , ”
80040	80059	80028	80028	He	2530	“ You need to be dealing with that skirt right about now . I need it off you . ”
80169	80172	80173	80173	I	2726	“ Henry . ”
80192	80195	80196	80196	He	2530	“ Shh . ”
80216	80223	80224	80224	He	2530	“ I love you right here . ”
80242	80247	80236	80236	I	2726	“ And right here . ”
80264	80267	80268	80268	He	2530	“ Here . ”
80318	80324	80325	80325	He	2530	“ You are so beautiful . ”
80379	80387	80363	80363	I	2726	“ I ’ve got you , baby . ”
80438	80450	80426	80426	I	2726	“ This is hardly fair . You with all the clothes . ”
80507	80512	80513	80513	I	2726	“ Not . Fair , ”
80516	80522	80523	80523	He	2530	“ Fair is for judges . ”
80561	80598	80540	80540	He	2530	“ I plan to be totally unfair with you . I ’m going to exploit every advantage . I 'm going to keep you naked underneath me and fuck you until you ’re screaming my name . ”
80599	80602	80603	80603	I	2726	“ Uh , ”
80614	80624	80606	80606	He	2530	“ Do yourself , baby . Get yourself ready . ”
80625	80631	80632	80632	He	2530	“ I want you to . ”
80715	80725	80694	80694	He	2530	“ You do n’t know how hot you are . ”
80726	80730	80731	80731	I	2726	“ Come here , ”
80805	80819	80820	80820	he	2530	“ Did n’t you have a job you were supposed to be doing ? ”
80823	80831	80820	80820	he	2530	“ I have a different job now . ”
80839	80844	80836	80836	he	2530	“ A lateral move , ”
80860	80867	80868	80868	he	2530	“ … gon na kill me , ”
80880	80890	80871	80871	I	2726	“ There might be a graze of teeth involved . ”
80940	80944	80945	80945	I	2726	“ Fuck me , ”
80970	80974	80975	80975	he	2530	“ You sure ? ”
81001	81006	81007	81007	I	2726	“ I ’m sure . ”
81100	81104	81105	81105	he	2530	“ Holy shit , ”
81141	81144	81145	81145	He	2530	“ Henry — ”
81159	81169	81170	81170	he	2530	“ We do n’t have to think of anything , ”
81173	81194	81170	81170	he	2530	“ Just concentrate on me moving inside you . How hard you have me . What you do to me … ”
81205	81210	81211	81211	He	2530	“ How unbelievably good … ”
81282	81292	81293	81293	he	2530	“ I want to memorize every sound you make , ”
81319	81335	81301	81301	he	2530	“ Everything is new with you . Every way I feel is new with you . ”
81336	81341	81342	81342	I	2726	“ Me , too , ”
81346	81351	81352	81352	he	2530	“ You ’re close , ”
81413	81420	81401	81401	he	2530	“ Henry , please ! More . ”
81430	81441	81426	81426	He	2530	“ Pull it , baby . Take what you need . ”
81492	81498	81499	81499	he	2530	“ You are so unbelievable , ”
81552	81561	81562	81562	he	2530	“ I was going to take more time , ”
81565	81571	81572	81572	I	2726	“ I had a plan . ”
81575	81587	81572	81572	I	2726	“ I mean it . I want everything perfect for you . ”
81588	81601	81606	81606	he	2530	“ You were supposed to leave your CEO role behind , remember ? ”
81602	81605	81606	81606	he	2530	“ Sorry , ”
81609	81637	81606	81606	he	2530	“ Do n’t be . You make me feel like one of your people . You ’re so beautiful with your people . They ’re so lucky . ”
81638	81644	81645	81645	I	2726	“ You are my people . ”
81771	81777	81778	81778	He	2530	“ What are you making ? ”
81786	81792	81793	81793	I	2726	“ What are you wearing ? ”
81800	81803	81804	81804	He	2530	“ This ? ”
81813	81842	81804	81804	He	2530	“ Alfredo sauce . And I ’m at a critical point in this operation . There ’s wine breathing . Why do n’t you pour us a glass . ”
81871	81884	81885	81885	he	2530	“ You have to add the cheese to the sauce so slowly , ”
81911	81915	81885	81885	he	2530	“ So slowly . ”
81916	81921	81922	81922	He	2530	“ It smells amazing . ”
81934	81944	81922	81922	He	2530	“ Most people do n’t do it like this . ”
81972	81981	81982	81982	I	2726	“ You are so going to ruin dinner . ”
81987	81994	81982	81982	I	2726	“ I ’m trying not to . ”
81995	81998	81999	81999	I	2726	“ Trying . ”
82008	82014	82015	82015	He	2530	“ Trying is not doing . ”
82030	82035	82036	82036	he	2530	“ Look at you , ”
82047	82053	82054	82054	He	2530	“ Look at me what ? ”
82217	82224	82211	82211	He	2530	“ It was never like this . ”
82251	82256	82257	82257	I	2726	“ Me , too , ”
82280	82285	82286	82286	he	2530	“ I 'm glad , ”
82289	82302	82286	82286	he	2530	“ That was unbelievable . I wanted to do everything to you . ”
82303	82309	82286	82286	he	2530	“ You kind of did . ”
82310	82315	82286	82286	he	2530	“ Oh , hardly . ”
82316	82321	82286	82286	he	2530	“ Oh , hardly . ”
82325	82342	82286	82286	he	2530	“ I love to feel you come inside me . I love how your body feels . ”
82343	82350	82351	82351	he	2530	“ I love how you breathe , ”
82354	82364	82365	82365	I	2726	“ Sometimes you just breathe and I want you . ”
82372	82378	82365	82365	I	2726	“ And that biting thing … ”
82379	82382	82383	82383	I	2726	“ Yeah ? ”
82386	82389	82390	82390	he	2530	“ Yeah , ”
82393	82400	82401	82401	I	2726	“ And that wet finger thing . ”
82406	82412	82401	82401	I	2726	“ What wet finger thing ? ”
82413	82420	82421	82421	I	2726	“ You know . The touch . ”
82433	82450	82451	82451	I	2726	“ When you lightly touched my asshole with your wet finger ? It was … hot . ”
82466	82475	82457	82457	I	2726	“ I was n’t doing anything like that . ”
82476	82485	82486	82486	I	2726	“ You just touched it , really lightly . ”
82529	82532	82533	82533	I	2726	“ Oh … ”
82536	82543	82544	82544	He	2530	“ What ? What ’s wrong ? ”
82573	82578	82579	82579	he	2530	“ So not funny , ”
82582	82589	82590	82590	I	2726	“ It ’s a little funny , ”
82602	82608	82609	82609	I	2726	“ Go away , Smuckers ! ”
82614	82632	82633	82633	I	2726	“ I honestly do n’t know if that clinches your Most Eligible Bastard status or destroys it , ”
82636	82641	82642	82642	he	2530	“ Do n’t even , ”
82657	82669	82654	82654	I	2726	“ And to think I imagined you did n’t like dogs . ”
82670	82683	82684	82684	He	2530	“ That has to be the last joke you make about that . ”
82694	82705	82706	82706	He	2530	“ The last ? Is n’t that a little extreme ? ”
82711	82726	82706	82706	He	2530	“ I mean it . Or I might retaliate in the most excruciating way . ”
82727	82733	82734	82734	I	2726	“ I might like it , ”
82737	82744	82734	82734	I	2726	“ But okay . Last joke . ”
82774	82781	82782	82782	she	1797	“ You think the sauce survived ? ”
82785	82791	82782	82782	she	1797	“ I know it did . ”
82809	82823	82824	82824	She	1797	“ I think you ’re going to be pleasantly surprised with this dish . ”
82830	82839	82824	82824	She	1797	“ You just think you ’re Mr. Awesome . ”
82840	82844	82845	82845	I	2726	“ Kind of . ”
82850	82859	82860	82860	She	1797	“ I ’ll be the judge of that . ”
82868	82878	82879	82879	she	1797	“ The talent portion of Most Eligible Bastard contest , ”
82887	82902	82882	82882	I	2726	“ I do believe I aced the talent portion of the contest earlier tonight . ”
82903	82906	82907	82907	she	1797	“ Hmmm , ”
82910	82914	82915	82915	She	1797	“ Good point . ”
82936	82941	82942	82942	she	1797	“ Oh my god , ”
82945	82950	82942	82942	she	1797	“ What ’s that ? ”
82962	82970	82951	82951	She	1797	“ Parmesan garlic taste freak - out . ”
83101	83105	83106	83106	I	2726	“ Fuck off , ”
83109	83112	83113	83113	she	1797	“ What ? ”
83116	83131	83113	83113	she	1797	“ I ca n’t look at you guys now ? My two fave guys ? ”
83132	83139	83140	83140	I	2726	“ No , you ca n’t , ”
83400	83403	83404	83404	I	2726	“ Hey , ”
83407	83419	83404	83404	I	2726	“ What are you and Carly doing for Labor Day weekend ? ”
83420	83426	83427	83427	she	1846	“ I do n’t know , ”
83430	83434	83427	83427	she	1846	“ Nothing special . ”
83435	83454	83455	83455	She	1846	“ You want to get out of the city ? I have a beach place in the Hamptons . ”
83482	83487	83477	83477	she	1846	“ What is it ? ”
83488	83491	83492	83492	She	1846	“ Well … ”
83505	83511	83514	83514	she	1846	“ With everything so crazy … ”
83612	83618	83619	83619	I	2726	“ Why not extend it ? ”
83622	83637	83638	83638	Her	1846	“ Vacation holiday . Who says we ca n’t extend it ? Nothing intruding . ”
83645	83657	83658	83658	She	1846	“ Just for the record , things will be set right . ”
83682	83711	83712	83712	I	2726	“ I ’m not worried about that . I take you at your word . I 'm not talking about the company , I ’m talking about this . ”
83717	83748	83712	83712	I	2726	“ You know you want to . We ’re in this far . Let ’s keep it going . All the complications . Screw it all . Three more days . ”
83756	83767	83768	83768	I	2726	“ We leave the whole spiderweb of our lives behind , ”
83771	83777	83768	83768	I	2726	“ We leave it here . ”
83783	83792	83768	83768	I	2726	“ Or , actually , in the limo . ”
83793	83800	83801	83801	She	1846	“ I ca n’t leave Carly . ”
83809	83842	83801	83801	She	1846	“ Not for a weekend . I mean , she ’s sixteen . She would probably be fine . She ’d love me to leave her with the place to herself but — ”
83843	83857	83858	83858	I	2726	“ I did n’t mean just you , I meant both of you , ”
83861	83905	83858	83858	I	2726	“ I ’d love to meet her and have her up with us . The best beach is just a few blocks away . We have a full staff . She can have her own room . We could leave Friday , early . ”
83915	83919	83906	83906	I	2726	“ The traffic .... ”
83920	83923	83924	83924	I	2726	“ Right , ”
83927	83959	83960	83960	She	1847	“ If only I owned a strange machine with a propeller on the top of it that could fly right over cars and buildings . Oh , wait , I do . ”
83963	83971	83960	83960	She	1847	“ Tell me it ’s not blue . ”
83972	83977	83978	83978	She	1847	“ It ’s blue . ”
84019	84037	84038	84038	she	1847	“ Carly has two day - long can’t - miss dates to run lines with her girlfriend , ”
84041	84064	84038	84038	she	1847	“ They ’re trying to get leads in the fall production . I forgot they carved those out for this long weekend . ”
84065	84080	84081	84081	I	2726	“ Have her bring her girlfriend . Trust me , we have the space . ”
84093	84136	84089	84089	She	1847	“ Of course , they might not get much studying done . Two of the guys from One Direction have rented the place next to mine . They might be rehearsing for some kind of duet tour . It could be distracting . ”
84142	84145	84089	84089	She	1847	“ Seriously ? ”
84146	84156	84164	84164	she	1847	“ Would I joke about something like One Direction ? ”
84157	84163	84164	84164	she	1847	“ This feels like blackmail , ”
84167	84185	84164	84164	she	1847	“ If I do n’t say yes and she finds out , she ’ll literally kill me . ”
84186	84192	84193	84193	I	2726	“ That would be terrible , ”
84352	84364	84365	84365	I	2726	“ I know it ’s not what you ’re used to , ”
84370	84379	84380	84380	she	250	“ It ’s a breath of fresh air , ”
84383	84392	84380	84380	she	250	“ You know how messy teenaged girls are ? ”
84393	84411	84412	84412	I	2726	“ It ’s thrilling to see you have … friends here . We ’re all so pleased . ”
84624	84632	84633	84633	I	2726	“ You take good care of her , ”
84737	84745	84746	84746	she	1797	“ We ’re all each other has , ”
84922	84937	84938	84938	I	2726	“ Back in your town , remember how you told me about being bullied ? ”
84948	84951	84941	84941	Vicky	1797	“ Sure . ”
84952	84958	84959	84959	Her	1797	“ Was it somebody wealthy ? ”
84963	84970	84959	84959	Her	1797	“ Why would you think that ? ”
84971	85003	85004	85004	She	1797	“ Just wondering . You ’re not impressed like a lot of people are . And , well , you did call me a rich , entitled jackass at one point . ”
85009	85018	85004	85004	She	1797	“ You know I do n’t think that . ”
85063	85075	85076	85076	She	76	“ Did my mother seem … happy in those last years ? ”
85081	85084	85076	85076	She	76	“ Henry — ”
85085	85101	85102	85102	I	2726	“ I just … didn’t know her the last few years . I missed her . ”
85108	85117	85118	85118	I	2726	“ She seemed happy … in her way . ”
85121	85174	85175	85175	I	2726	“ I was n’t sure how much you wanted to know about her . But , yes . She had her routines and Smuckers . She ’d terrorize people in the neighborhood , like when they wanted to pet him , she ’d act angry . That was kind of her jam . ”
85190	85197	85198	85198	I	2726	“ She was such a character , ”
85201	85227	85198	85198	I	2726	“ I always imagined I could repair things . That somehow I ’d break through and we ’d have a heart - to - heart . ”
85228	85233	85234	85234	she	76	“ I ’m sorry , ”
85299	85308	85309	85309	I	2726	“ I ’m glad she had you around , ”
85319	85327	85312	85312	She	76	“ I ’m glad I could be . ”
85328	85338	85312	85312	She	76	“ Why do you think my mother chose you ? ”
85339	85345	85346	85346	she	76	“ I do n’t know , ”
85349	85393	85346	85346	she	76	“ Maybe it ’s silly to keep wondering about it , but I do . Do you think my mother chose you because she sensed you have an allergy to guys like me ? Did you two talk about that sort of thing ? ”
85394	85397	85312	85312	She	76	“ Hmm . ”
85398	85436	85312	85312	She	76	“ I know she ostensibly chose you on the basis of your being a dog whisperer , but she could ’ve done a lot of messed - up things with that will . Yet she chose you . ”
85437	85447	85448	85448	she	76	“ I really think it was about the dog , ”
85451	85466	85467	85467	She	76	“ She loved that dog . Even the last words she said to me … ”
85477	85487	85488	85488	I	2726	“ It ’s okay , you can tell me , ”
85491	85510	85488	85488	I	2726	“ Please . Tell me . They were the last words she said . I want to know . ”
85511	85534	85535	85535	My	2726	“ Well , they were about the dog . Clutching at him , and she goes , I love you , Pokey . ”
85539	85545	85535	85535	My	2726	“ What did you say ? ”
85546	85601	85602	85602	I	2726	“ I love you , Pokey . I do n't know why she called Smuckers that , you know , there at the end . I never heard her call him that , but it had to be Smuckers she was talking to . Smuckers is a little pokey , you have to admit . ”
85611	85616	85617	85617	she	1887	“ What is it ? ”
85626	85630	85631	85631	I	2726	“ Thank you , ”
85634	85638	85631	85631	I	2726	“ For what ? ”
85659	85666	85670	85670	Brett	102	“ Just … all of it . ”
85981	85993	85994	85994	I	2726	“ I 'm glad the fireworks are going off behind us , ”
85997	86020	85994	85994	I	2726	“ Because if they were right out there over the water ? I ’d have to arrest myself for multiple cliché violations . ”
86021	86037	86038	86038	she	1797	“ The foam on the waves is just as bright . It looks almost neon , ”
86050	86056	86038	86038	she	1797	“ It ’s the phosphorescence . ”
86085	86089	86066	86066	She	1797	“ Come here . ”
86362	86373	86355	86355	Henry	77	“ Have I told you how hot you are recently ? ”
86411	86426	86427	86427	I	2726	“ It ’s been so long since I was just happy . Stupidly happy , ”
86453	86457	86442	86442	Henry	77	“ Thank you . ”
86458	86467	86468	86468	he	77	“ Does it make you a little sad ? ”
86484	86490	86476	86476	he	77	“ Did I sound sad ? ”
86506	86513	86514	86514	he	77	“ I ’m happy , too , ”
86518	86527	86514	86514	he	77	“ But nothing about my happiness feels stupid . ”
86832	86839	86825	86825	He	77	“ You do n’t have to — ”
86840	86870	86871	86871	I	2726	“ If you think I ’m not man enough to carry a flowered dog carrier that looks like a purse , you have n’t been paying attention , baby . ”
87094	87099	87100	87100	Brett	102	“ Henry , Vicky . ”
87114	87128	87100	87100	Brett	102	“ I want you to meet our new leadership consultant , Denny Woodruff . ”
87156	87160	87161	87161	Henry	102	“ Leadership consultant ? ”
87196	87210	87211	87211	Brett	102	“ Denny’ll be working closely with us on board leadership and cohesiveness issues , ”
87224	87277	87211	87211	Brett	102	“ I think this will be especially helpful to you , Vicky . To get you integrated , to get us working in tandem instead of at odds . You ’ll be working very closely with Denny . Every board meeting , Denny will be right there , helping you integrate productively . ”
87283	87288	87289	87289	Henry	1797	“ What is this ? ”
87292	87300	87301	87301	He	102	“ Vicky does n’t need leadership consulting . ”
87308	87314	87315	87315	He	102	“ What ’s going on ? ”
87325	87339	87340	87340	Brett	102	“ Kaleb and I agree this could really be good for the board , ”
87343	87384	87385	87385	He	102	“ We made the move . It ’s within our rights to add a board consultant . We do n’t need a majority for that , just twenty - five percent . His salary is a matter of operations budget … ”
87440	87467	87429	87429	He	106	“ I ’ve done a lot of work with the Percival Group . I went to Yale with Dale Runson , who I think you know . ”
87485	87488	87489	87489	Henry	102	“ Okay . ”
87516	87532	87509	87509	He	102	“ Let ’s take five . I need a sidebar here with you and Kaleb . ”
87533	87540	87541	87541	Brett	102	“ Denny ’s a board consultant , ”
87544	87557	87558	87558	Brett	102	“ The point here is to include him , even in sidebars . ”
87563	87603	87604	87604	Denny	106	“ You do n’t have a problem with this , do you , Vicky ? Part of being a competent board member is to work well with others . If you do n’t think you can work with Denny … ”
87607	87630	87631	87631	He	102	“ Vicky ! I ’m excited for the opportunity to work with you . I feel like we accomplish a lot together . ”
87665	87670	87659	87659	Denny	106	“ I promise you — ”
87678	87682	87659	87659	Denny	106	“ Get away ! ”
87706	87716	87717	87717	Denny	106	“ I understand that they sprang it on you , ”
87730	87745	87746	87746	He	106	“ But before long , it ’ll be old home week , I promise . ”
87847	87851	87842	87842	Henry	1797	“ You okay ? ”
87852	87855	87856	87856	I	2726	“ No ! ”
88348	88351	88346	88346	Slacks	253	“ Vicky . ”
88356	88360	88361	88361	I	2726	“ Leave me , ”
88364	88368	88369	88369	He	2726	“ Not likely . ”
88378	88382	88369	88369	He	2726	“ What happened ? ”
88383	88389	88390	88390	I	2726	“ You do n’t know ? ”
88400	88408	88390	88390	I	2726	“ I just want to be alone . ”
88409	88417	88418	88418	I	2726	“ Can I be alone with you ? ”
88432	88436	88427	88427	Henry	1797	“ You know . ”
88437	88441	88390	88390	I	2726	“ Know what ? ”
88442	88450	88390	88390	I	2726	“ They did n’t fill you in ? ”
88451	88494	88427	88427	Henry	1797	“ Baby , I just ran halfway down a skyscraper stairwell until I could get an elevator and then down two crowded blocks , pissing off about five dozen bumbling pedestrians trying to find you . I ’ve been a little busy . ”
88495	88506	88390	88390	I	2726	“ How ’d you know I ’d go this way ? ”
88507	88516	88390	88390	I	2726	“ Who cares ? What ’s going on ? ”
88523	88534	88535	88535	I	2726	“ That Denny guy back there . What was that ? ”
88556	88593	88548	88548	He	2726	“ Calls from the tower . Probably Brett . What happens when I answer ? I ’ve had him blocked all weekend . What happens when I unblock him ? What am I going to see ? ”
88602	88605	88606	88606	I	2726	“ Uh , ”
88629	88636	88637	88637	he	2726	“ Well , that answers that , ”
88640	88652	88637	88637	he	2726	“ A forehead print . That ’s what I ’ll see . ”
88658	88662	88663	88663	I	2726	“ No joke , ”
88703	88709	88697	88697	I	2726	“ What ’s going on ? ”
88710	88726	88732	88732	I	2726	“ I did n’t want you to know . I thought you ’d never know . ”
88727	88731	88732	88732	I	2726	“ Know what ? ”
88737	88776	88732	88732	I	2726	“ The thing is , I knew if we stayed together , it would come out , and everything would be ruined . You ’d need to do damage control and , god , you ’d hate me . ”
88777	88786	88697	88697	I	2726	“ I could n’t hate you , Vicky . ”
88787	88791	88792	88792	I	2726	“ Maybe not , ”
88799	88817	88818	88818	He	2726	“ But you could hate Vonda O’Neil . You could hate her . You probably already do . ”
88827	88834	88818	88818	He	2726	“ What are you talking about ? ”
88835	88839	88840	88840	I	2726	“ Vonda O’Neil ? ”
88844	88866	88867	88867	He	2726	“ You do n’t remember liar Vonda O’Neil ? The whole sordid scandal eight years back ? Everyone remembers Vonda O’Neil . ”
88892	88895	88886	88886	he	2726	“ Wait — ”
88896	88901	88902	88902	I	2726	“ That ’s right , ”
88905	88911	88902	88902	I	2726	“ You ’re Vonda O’Neil . ”
88912	88915	88916	88916	I	2726	“ Ding . ”
88933	88941	88902	88902	I	2726	“ And Denny Woodruff … that was — ”
88942	88954	88955	88955	I	2726	“ Denny . The wronged victim , yeah . Falsely accused , ”
88958	88976	88955	88955	I	2726	“ The poor sweet boy with his bright future that was threatened by selfish , lying Vonda . ”
89040	89053	89037	89037	his	2726	“ Remember ? The trial ? The world - famous mayo shirt ? ”
89054	89086	89015	89015	He	2726	“ Oh , right . The shirt was supposed to prove he ’d kidnapped and … tried to assault you . You said it was semen , but it was mayo . ”
89087	89094	89037	89037	his	2726	“ Yup . It was mayo . ”
89095	89112	89037	89037	his	2726	“ That was you ? Wait — the well . You ended up in a well . ”
89113	89122	89015	89015	He	2726	“ You did n’t pay very good attention . ”
89123	89129	89037	89037	his	2726	“ I was in college . ”
89130	89177	89015	89015	He	2726	“ I hid in a well as part of my plot to destroy Denny ’s future . I pretended I fell in there . Three days I was in there . All the better to get media attention . It ’s what I wanted all along . ”
89184	89195	89196	89196	he	2726	“ So this is what you ’re going to do ? ”
89200	89209	89196	89196	he	2726	“ Do n’t I get the real story ? ”
89267	89274	89275	89275	he	2726	“ I thought you trusted me , ”
89285	89289	89278	89278	I	2726	“ Tell me . ”
89317	89322	89323	89323	he	2726	“ It ’s me , ”
89331	89337	89323	89323	he	2726	“ Just you and me . ”
89501	89504	89505	89505	Henry	1797	“ Fuck , ”
89509	89517	89505	89505	Henry	1797	“ I shoulda killed him in there . ”
89529	89546	89547	89547	He	2726	“ Do n’t worry , I wo n’t really kill him . Maybe . Then what ? ”
89556	89589	89547	89547	He	2726	“ I always think it was my terror of him that made him ejaculate all over my shirt instead of getting to the final act . Like my terror turned him on . ”
89598	89602	89603	89603	he	2726	“ Keep going , ”
89606	89615	89603	89603	he	2726	“ You ’re okay . We ’re okay . ”
89643	89648	89629	89629	he	2726	“ Left you there . ”
89649	89707	89629	89629	he	2726	“ Yeah . And something in me kicked in , working at that knot . I freed myself even as his boots crunched the gravel outside . I grabbed my panties and my shoes and ran out the back , pounding feet over cutting branches . I barely felt it . I just had to get away . ”
89708	89717	89629	89629	he	2726	“ In bare feet . Through the woods . ”
89718	89775	89776	89776	I	2726	“ I hardly felt it until I fell into that well . It was deep , but I only sprained my right ankle and broke the toe of my left . It could ’ve been worse , but the thing was filled with years of brush and leaves and dirt , and that cushioned my fall . ”
89922	89930	89904	89904	I	2726	“ That ’s why you stayed quiet . ”
89931	89939	89904	89904	I	2726	“ Three days I was in there . ”
90110	90120	90121	90121	I	2726	“ It was only later I remembered my shirt , ”
90125	90173	90174	90174	I	2726	“ I opened up the bag and found the crusty stain and I realized he ’d , you know , the shirt . Mom is the one who kept back the shirt . I was sixteen . I was n’t thinking five moves ahead like she was . ”
90216	90273	90211	90211	They	1959	“ I thought we should bring it to the police , but she said we should keep it for the trial . She said we could n’t trust the police , that we needed to keep the evidence . The Woodruffs tried to pay me off . A half a million dollars . Five hundred thousand . ”
90274	90295	90316	90316	I	2726	“ That must ’ve seemed like a lot of money to you . You passed up a lot of money . ”
90296	90315	90316	90316	I	2726	“ I wanted to stand up for other girls . I had evidence … I felt so sure … ”
90330	90349	90350	90350	I	2726	“ I was so sure I ’d be able to prove it with that shirt , you know ? ”
90353	90426	90350	90350	I	2726	“ When it came back as mayonnaise , I thought the police lab was lying . Like the Woodruffs paid off the lab , and I demanded an independent analysis . Mayo again . By that time , I was this monster . Months later , I found the bank statement from my mom ’s account . Twenty thousand dollars deposited into it the day before we produced the shirt for testing . ”
90427	90431	90432	90432	he	2726	“ The Woodruffs , ”
90435	90521	90350	90350	I	2726	“ It was a pretty common shirt from Savemart . I think they bought a duplicate and switched it . The mayo would ’ve been the Woodruffs ’ idea . My mother would never have thought of something so devious and damning . The mayo is what made me look like I deliberately tried to frame him . Like a teen without sophisticated knowledge of forensic techniques tried to frame this rich boy . Everybody hated me . The world was this wall of hate . ”
90522	90530	90531	90531	he	2726	“ The betrayal you were talking about , ”
90534	90543	90544	90544	I	2726	“ That was your mom selling the shirt . ”
90547	90568	90569	90569	I	2726	“ There was nothing she would n’t do . She was a good mom before Dad died . But after … ”
90574	90594	90569	90569	I	2726	“ But I just wanted justice . I wanted the world to know what kind of guy Denny is . ”
90617	90622	90610	90610	I	2726	“ You believe me ? ”
90623	90629	90630	90630	I	2726	“ What ? Of course . ”
90635	90645	90630	90630	I	2726	“ Because of how I was in the elevator ? ”
90646	90663	90664	90664	My	2726	“ No , because of how you are period . Because I know who you are . ”
90670	90681	90664	90664	My	2726	“ You did n’t even know my name until now . ”
90682	90692	90693	90693	I	2726	“ A name is n’t who a person is . ”
90716	90720	90710	90710	I	2726	“ Thank you . ”
90721	90768	90710	90710	I	2726	“ Do n’t thank me . After what you ’ve been through ? I do n’t remember the specifics of the case , but I sure remember the Vonda O’Neil feeding frenzy . I remember that . And you were innocent all that time . God . ”
90816	90824	90825	90825	I	2726	“ That ’s when you came here ? ”
90828	90961	90962	90962	He	1964	“ My mom took a year to burn through the money . She had a lot of bad boyfriends . She was going downhill . It got less and less safe for me and Carly as the money dwindled . I ’d been secretly saving , though . And then I did an interview they paid me for , and that was a lot of money . That was what I used to move one night . I just took her and ran . I did n’t want Carly to stay back there . It was n’t safe for either of us , but especially not Carly . I mean , it was n’t always so bad . Before my dad died , we were a normal family . A happy family . ”
90970	90977	90962	90962	He	1964	“ I ca n’t even imagine . ”
90978	90983	90984	90984	I	2726	“ You believe me , ”
90996	91002	91003	91003	I	2726	“ Of course I do . ”
91008	91019	91020	91020	he	1964	“ I do n’t know how you could doubt it , ”
91023	91071	91020	91020	he	1964	“ I mean , after all those hours we spent in that little workroom toiling side - by - side using toothpicks and glue to get tiny paper curlicues to stick to tiny paper tree trunks ? When two people go through an experience like that together … ”
91082	91122	91072	91072	I	2726	“ Seriously , even if I had n’t been in that elevator shaft with you , where it was , let ’s face it , pretty obvious you ’re not somebody who would ’ve gone into a well voluntarily — ”
91123	91128	91129	91129	I	2726	“ I would never , ”
91132	91149	91129	91129	I	2726	“ I know . And also , Denny ? That ’s not a good guy there . ”
91150	91155	91072	91072	I	2726	“ You know him ? ”
91156	91180	91072	91072	I	2726	“ Jesus , the way he came at you ? Do n’t need to taste much to know if it ’s cottage cheese . ”
91181	91186	91187	91187	He	1965	“ You punched him . ”
91211	91230	91187	91187	He	1965	“ If I knew what I know now , I would ’ve put him right through that glass . ”
91437	91443	91444	91444	she	898	“ It hums with blueness , ”
91447	91450	91451	91451	I	2726	“ Unbelievable , ”
91557	91563	91564	91564	I	2726	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
91570	91582	91564	91564	I	2726	“ What did you do ? You did n’t invite him . ”
91583	91595	91614	91614	She	898	“ I started those wheels in motion . Scheming with Brett . ”
91596	91613	91614	91614	She	898	“ I do n’t blame you . In no universe would I blame you for that . ”
91691	91695	91685	91685	She	898	“ Come here . ”
91707	91712	91713	91713	she	898	“ I feel better , ”
91716	91720	91713	91713	she	898	“ Thank you . ”
91778	91783	91784	91784	she	898	“ Cookies and tea , ”
91791	91807	91784	91784	she	898	“ Next thing I know I ’ll come over and you ’re knitting tea cozies . ”
91808	91821	91822	91822	I	2726	“ I think I ’m man enough to knit a tea cozy , ”
91832	91844	91829	91829	She	898	“ Oh , you ’re man enough to crochet a doily . ”
91988	91995	91996	91996	she	898	“ I like feeding you cookies , ”
91999	92004	92005	92005	I	2726	“ That ’s convenient , ”
92008	92018	92005	92005	I	2726	“ Because I like your fingers in my mouth . ”
92019	92022	92005	92005	I	2726	“ Yeah ? ”
92023	92026	92027	92027	I	2726	“ Yeah , ”
92271	92274	92275	92275	she	898	“ Mmm , ”
92282	92285	92275	92275	she	898	“ Vicky . ”
92300	92307	92275	92275	she	898	“ Vicky , Vicky , Vicky … ”
92352	92360	92341	92341	She	898	“ What are you , a vampire ? ”
92488	92492	92493	92493	she	898	“ Carry me , ”
92496	92499	92493	92493	she	898	“ Hurry . ”
92650	92660	92645	92645	She	898	“ I wo n’t last if you do that ! ”
92936	92946	92947	92947	she	898	“ I did n’t know this was over here , ”
92986	92995	92996	92996	She	898	“ Little - known secret of my veranda . ”
93002	93005	92996	92996	She	898	“ Mmm . ”
93025	93038	93039	93039	She	898	“ Go on . Get in . I ’ll grab the beers . ”
93044	93058	93039	93039	She	898	“ I thought you were n’t supposed to drink alcohol in these things . ”
93059	93073	93074	93074	I	2726	“ Maybe you can look into making a citizen ’s arrest later on , ”
93080	93089	93077	93077	She	898	“ I think I will look into that . ”
93119	93125	93126	93126	she	898	“ I should get Smuckers , ”
93132	93140	93126	93126	she	898	“ I really , really so should . ”
93141	93147	93148	93148	I	2726	“ April can handle Smuckers , ”
93151	93167	93148	93148	I	2726	“ Also , I do n’t think Smuckers would be fun in a hot tub . ”
93168	93181	93182	93182	I	2726	“ Not to mention how bad it would mess up his hairdo . ”
93328	93331	93332	93332	he	102	“ Dude , ”
93338	93341	93332	93332	he	102	“ Dude ? ”
93348	93367	93342	93342	I	2726	“ What the hell were you thinking ? You knew who that was and you brought him in ? ”
93368	93397	93332	93332	he	102	“ Of course I knew . But you ’re the one who stole the show . That punch ? Stroke of genius . The ultimate good cop move . ”
93398	93404	93342	93342	I	2726	“ You bring him in ? ”
93405	93449	93342	93342	I	2726	“ We did n’t even need him . I just got off the phone with Malcomb . Her lawyer contacted him about terminology questions for papers for signing off ownership for a dollar . I underestimated the powers of the Henry Locke dick . ”
93450	93457	93332	93332	he	102	“ What are you talking about ? ”
93458	93528	93529	93529	My	2726	“ The company . She ’s giving it back . For a dollar . And you ’ll be happy to know that I smoothed everything over with Denny . We own a parcel of land up north that the Woodruffs want for something . Small price to pay for keeping him quiet about a dog and Vonda O’Neil on our board because please , that would be a disaster . ”
93542	93561	93533	93533	She	1995	“ You deserve an Academy Award , brother . We do n’t even need the competency hearing now . ”
93562	93567	93568	93568	My	2726	“ That ’s not — ”
93586	93590	93579	93579	He	2726	“ Competency hearing ? ”
93622	93630	93618	93618	Her	1995	“ Competency hearing ? Operation good cop ? ”
93631	93639	93640	93640	I	2726	“ It ’s not what you think . ”
93645	93651	93652	93652	She	1995	“ Get away from me ! ”
93656	93663	93652	93652	She	1995	“ All that was an act ? ”
93664	93669	93618	93618	Her	1995	“ Of course not ! ”
93670	93682	93652	93652	She	1995	“ What ’s operation good cop ? Is that a thing ? ”
93683	93687	93688	93688	I	2726	“ It was , ”
93691	93696	93688	93688	I	2726	“ A stupid thing . ”
93697	93714	93715	93715	I	2726	“ What ’s the competency hearing ? Is that also a stupid thing ? A hearing ? ”
93730	93743	93688	93688	I	2726	“ You were going to put me on trial ? For competency ? ”
93744	93752	93688	93688	I	2726	“ That ’s not how it is . ”
93753	93760	93688	93688	I	2726	“ You said you trusted me . ”
93761	93775	93688	93688	I	2726	“ I do trust you . I was going to call it off . ”
93776	93787	93788	93788	She	1995	“ But it ’s still on . As of now . ”
93793	93804	93788	93788	She	1995	“ Is it still on ? As of this moment ? ”
93813	93822	93788	93788	She	1995	“ I was going to call it off . ”
93823	93838	93873	93873	She	1995	“ Please , just say . Is it still on ? As of now ? ”
93839	93848	93853	93853	She	1995	“ Yes . Technically it ’s still on . ”
93849	93852	93853	93853	She	1995	“ Technically . ”
93856	93872	93873	93873	She	1995	“ And all this time , were you guys gathering evidence ? To destroy me ? ”
93886	93911	93879	93879	I	2726	“ Awesome performance . I guess that ’s one thing Brett and I can agree on . It was absolutely award winning . Bravo . ”
93912	93918	93919	93919	She	1995	“ I was n’t performing . ”
93954	93957	93958	93958	I	2726	“ Vicky , ”
93974	94002	93962	93962	she	1995	“ Do n’t worry , I ’ll still give it back . I ’ll sign and deliver those papers I drew up . For half a million . ”
94003	94007	94008	94008	I	2726	“ Do n’t , ”
94020	94026	94008	94008	I	2726	“ That ’s my offer . ”
94027	94030	94031	94031	Brett	102	“ Henry — ”
94072	94078	94079	94079	I	2726	“ This is n’t you , ”
94082	94088	94079	94079	I	2726	“ You fight for things . ”
94089	94129	94140	94140	she	2530	“ I did n’t get the half mill the last time around . So you ’ll pay it to me , and if you do n’t , the world will learn that Vonda O’Neil and Smuckers run your company . ”
94130	94133	94079	94079	I	2726	“ Vicky . ”
94134	94139	94140	94140	she	2530	“ It ’s Vonda , ”
94143	94196	94140	94140	she	2530	“ I ’m Vonda O’Neil . And I have to say , keeping me on good behavior with the good cop act while you gather evidence for the hearing ? Very effective . Who knows what I would ’ve done . Maybe even painted those cranes pink , with Smuckers ’s face — ”
94197	94202	94203	94203	Brett	102	“ We ’ll pay ! ”
94206	94215	94216	94216	I	2726	“ I do n’t want you to go , ”
94219	94224	94216	94216	I	2726	“ Brett is going . ”
94225	94230	94231	94231	She	2530	“ A bank transfer . ”
94243	94256	94231	94231	She	2530	“ Five hundred thousand and you ’ll never hear from me again . ”
94257	94278	94279	94279	Her	2530	“ I was n’t pretending — you know I was n’t . Feel the truth of that . Of us . ”
94284	94317	94318	94318	I	2726	“ If you follow me or try to contact me , I ’ll tell the New York Tribune the story of Vonda O’Neil and a dog and their hold over Locke Worldwide . ”
94345	94355	94334	94334	I	2726	“ I know what this looks like to you . ”
94356	94360	94361	94361	she	2530	“ Do you ? ”
94364	94405	94406	94406	She	2530	“ Please understand when I ask you to leave me be . Respect me on that . Have the money in my bank account by bank open tomorrow . With that you ’ll get my silence and your company back . ”
94412	94443	94406	94406	She	2530	“ If the money is n’t there , you can kiss the stability of the Locke name goodbye . You ’ll learn firsthand about the power of the Vonda name . ”
94444	94453	94454	94454	I	2726	“ Screw the company . I want you , ”
94462	94465	94457	94457	Brett	102	“ Dude . ”
94471	94478	94466	94466	I	2726	“ We got this , Vicky . ”
94506	94518	94489	94489	She	2530	“ It does n’t actually go faster when you do that , ”
94531	94537	94538	94538	Carly	470	“ The day after tomorrow ? ”
94555	94562	94563	94563	she	2530	“ It ’s my junior year , ”
94566	94573	94563	94563	she	2530	“ We ca n’t just leave ! ”
94574	94579	94563	94563	she	2530	“ We have to . ”
94580	94588	94563	94563	she	2530	“ But we ca n’t ! Please … ”
94589	94595	94596	94596	She	2530	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
94607	94629	94596	94596	She	2530	“ And our show just went up . And Bess … oh my god , I ’ll never see Bess again ! ”
94630	94637	94638	94638	I	2726	“ You ’ll see her again . ”
94651	94672	94644	94644	I	2726	“ All my friends . Our whole life . If I leave school they ’ll never let me back in . ”
94673	94679	94596	94596	She	2530	“ I know , baby . ”
94680	94703	94644	94644	I	2726	“ Is n’t there some other way ? There has to be ! You always think of something . You always do . ”
94712	94731	94732	94732	She	2000	“ I thought about it long and hard . This is the best I can do for us . ”
94794	94799	94800	94800	Carly	470	“ All our stuff , ”
94837	94842	94830	94830	she	2000	“ I ’m sorry . ”
94843	94865	94830	94830	she	2000	“ What if I finished out the semester living at Bess ’s place ? And then maybe it all dies down … ”
94866	94927	94830	94830	she	2000	“ Connect the dots , Carly . Denny will spill . He lives to make my life miserable . Or somehow it gets out — too many people know . And Mom hears . She ’s going to want you back . Especially if she sniffs the money — she’ll want you back and she ’ll figure out an angle . ”
94928	94950	94995	94995	She	2002	“ She ’s a drug addict ! She did n’t even file a missing persons report . Wo n’t they see ? ”
94951	94994	94995	94995	She	2002	“ She ’s your mother and I ’m Vonda — that ’s what they ’ll see . They ’ll put you back with her . You ’re leaving New York with me or her . You know I 'm much more fun . ”
95075	95094	95068	95068	I	2726	“ We can go a lot of places with that money . Where do you want to go ? ”
95095	95105	95112	95112	I	2726	“ Nowhere . I want to go exactly nowhere . ”
95106	95111	95112	95112	I	2726	“ Me , too , ”
95153	95167	95144	95144	We	2004	“ We ’ll never see the sad mimes or fierce protector guy again . ”
95168	95172	95173	95173	I	2726	“ I know . ”
95181	95199	95173	95173	I	2726	“ Let ’s think of a cool place to go where you can continue your theater training . ”
95640	95649	95650	95650	I	2726	“ You ’ve been such a good friend , ”
95653	95669	95650	95650	I	2726	“ Trust me . It ’s better this way . A storm could be coming . ”
95708	95713	95714	95714	she	137	“ I hate this , ”
95717	95736	95714	95714	she	137	“ It ’s morbid . You ’ve been collecting these for years . You have to take them . ”
95737	95760	95714	95714	she	137	“ I ’m going on a plane with a dog and a teenager . I ca n’t take my tools , too . ”
95761	95770	95771	95771	I	2726	“ How are you going to make jewelry ? ”
95774	95781	95771	95771	I	2726	“ I ’ll figure it out . ”
95782	95789	95790	95790	she	137	“ I ’m taking them all , ”
95798	95815	95790	95790	she	137	“ And I ’m keeping them for you for when you return . You belong here . ”
97264	97272	97273	97273	I	2726	“ Now you ’ll tell the truth , ”
97276	97297	97298	97298	She	757	“ And after that , you ’ll deliver the evidence you ’re holding back . We know you have it . ”
97456	97459	97460	97460	Marv	262	“ Helloooooo , ”
97477	97487	97460	97460	Marv	262	“ And with this , the story goes national . ”
97953	97964	97942	97942	Smitty	264	“ Should we ask those three to sit with us ? ”
97965	97969	97970	97970	I	2726	“ Not me , ”
97987	97990	97991	97991	Smitty	264	“ Theo ? ”
97999	98006	97994	97994	Theo	265	“ You ’re on your own . ”
98007	98015	98016	98016	Smitty	264	“ I ca n’t fuck all three , ”
98019	98026	98027	98027	Theo	265	“ Well , actually I could … ”
98063	98078	98057	98057	Smitty	264	“ Come on , Henry , when was the last time you had any ? ”
98079	98090	98091	98091	I	2726	“ A minute ago , and it tasted utterly amazing , ”
98094	98101	98102	98102	Smitty	264	“ You know what I mean , ”
98283	98287	98288	98288	Smitty	264	“ You sure ? ”
98291	98300	98301	98301	I	2726	“ I ’m not over my last thing , ”
98304	98308	98309	98309	He	264	“ Final answer . ”
98314	98334	98309	98309	He	264	“ What ’s your excuse ? You ’re not dating anybody . Look at them — smokin ’ hot ! ”
98335	98342	98343	98343	Theo	265	“ I ’m not dating anybody , ”
98346	98352	98343	98343	Theo	265	“ But there is somebody . ”
98353	98356	98357	98357	I	2726	“ What ? ”
98372	98377	98364	98364	I	2726	“ Who is she ? ”
98378	98387	98388	98388	he	265	“ I do n’t know who she is , ”
98391	98397	98364	98364	I	2726	“ That ’s the problem . ”
98398	98404	98405	98405	Smitty	264	“ I do n’t understand , ”
98408	98434	98435	98435	He	265	“ This is going to sound a little crazy , but I ’ve been having … conversations … with my wake - up call girl . ”
98442	98445	98446	98446	I	2726	“ Conversations ? ”
98461	98469	98455	98455	He	265	“ Are we talking phone sex here ? ”
98473	98488	98489	98489	Theo	265	“ No . I mean , yeah , but it ’s more than that , ”
98492	98498	98499	98499	he	265	“ We talk about everything , ”
98502	98513	98514	98514	Smitty	264	“ But to be clear , phone sex is involved , ”
98528	98531	98532	98532	I	2726	“ Jesus , ”
98539	98546	98547	98547	I	2726	“ You ’ve never seen her , ”
98550	98561	98562	98562	Theo	265	“ You literally have no idea what she looks like … ”
98567	98588	98562	98562	Theo	265	“ No information about her whatsoever . I ’ll find her , though . I ’m scouring this fucking city . ”
98589	98599	98600	98600	Smitty	264	“ You know she could be a total troglodyte , ”
98608	98616	98600	98600	Smitty	264	“ I do n’t give a shit . ”
98628	98635	98636	98636	He	264	“ I have to find her . ”
98648	98664	98645	98645	I	2726	“ Dude . Hard to find a woman who does n’t want to be found . ”
98735	98753	98754	98754	Smitty	264	“ Speaking of makers and their studios , you put a bid in for that London thing ? ”
98758	98763	98754	98754	Smitty	264	“ What London thing ? ”
98764	98775	98786	98786	I	2726	“ The huge warehouse share studio — Redmond or something ? ”
98776	98785	98786	98786	I	2726	“ I have n’t ever heard of it , ”
98789	98848	98849	98849	I	2726	“ That ’s weird . You have a UK presence . I would think Locke would be the first firm they ’d invite to bid . It ’s the kind of shit you guys have been getting off on lately . It ’s some big cooperative makers space . Freaking huge . Reclaimed urban ruin , neighborhood integration … ”
98867	98880	98856	98856	He	264	“ We bid it , and it ’s not even our thing . ”
98881	98890	98891	98891	I	2726	“ Are there places to eat , sleep ? ”
98908	98916	98903	98903	He	264	“ So you do know about it . ”
98917	98924	98925	98925	He	264	“ The owner ’s not named ? ”
98932	98935	98925	98925	He	264	“ No . ”
98936	98944	98903	98903	He	264	“ You have access to the RFP ? ”
98955	98971	98949	98949	I	2726	“ What ? And let you bid against us if you were n’t even invited ? ”
98979	98985	98972	98972	I	2726	“ Forward me the RFP . ”
99104	99109	99110	99110	Hanna	268	“ Hi , Veronica ! ”
99820	99823	99824	99824	she	2134	“ Courier , ”

100011	100014	100002	100002	Smuckers	1007	“ Henry . ”
100015	100025	100026	100026	he	2134	“ I carved one every day you were gone , ”
100033	100040	100041	100041	He	2134	“ You ca n’t be here . ”
100121	100134	100109	100109	he	2134	“ I want us back . What do I have to do ? ”
100143	100154	100109	100109	he	2134	“ I do n’t know if there was an us . ”
100173	100181	100182	100182	he	2134	“ There was an us for me , ”
100185	100195	100196	100196	Henry	1797	“ There always will be an us for me . ”
100205	100215	100216	100216	His	2134	“ You carved more than four hundred of those ? ”
100250	100259	100260	100260	I	2726	“ It feels like too much to believe , ”
100264	100277	100278	100278	He	2134	“ I know . I get it . You ’ve been burned . ”
100300	100312	100313	100313	he	2134	“ I burned you when I did n’t tell you everything , ”
100316	100350	100313	100313	he	2134	“ I should ’ve , and I did n’t . I could stand here and give you excuses , but I wo n’t . I just need you . Give us a chance . ”
100351	100356	100357	100357	His	2134	“ I ca n’t . ”
100379	100390	100313	100313	he	2134	“ Let me love you enough for both of us . ”
100391	100394	100313	100313	he	2134	“ What ? ”
100395	100400	100401	100401	His	2134	“ I love you . ”
100408	100428	100401	100401	His	2134	“ That ’s real . Everything was wrong , but that part ’s real . It always will be . ”
100497	100502	100503	100503	He	2134	“ And of course … ”
100517	100550	100503	100503	He	2134	“ You have to let me design and build your studio share project . I mean , please . You think anybody else can do it halfway as well as I could ? ”
100554	100568	100569	100569	He	2134	“ There ’s the Locke Kool - Aid that I know and love . ”
100586	100596	100597	100597	he	2134	“ It ’s just about the Kool - Aid ? ”
100612	100659	100605	100605	I	2726	“ If I tell you I love you , if I tell you how much I love you and how scared I am for it not to be real that you love me , will it stop you from carving more tiny griffins like a psycho ? ”
100660	100663	100664	100664	he	2134	“ No , ”
100667	100683	100664	100664	he	2134	“ I ’ll keep carving them for you . As long as I can carve . ”
101014	101017	101018	101018	Mandy	131	“ Vonda ! ”
101033	101040	101025	101025	She	470	“ Your sister ! So good . ”
101308	101324	101325	101325	he	102	“ Feed them a nice meal and they wo n’t go following you for crumbs , ”
101347	101350	101351	101351	Carly	470	“ No ! ”
