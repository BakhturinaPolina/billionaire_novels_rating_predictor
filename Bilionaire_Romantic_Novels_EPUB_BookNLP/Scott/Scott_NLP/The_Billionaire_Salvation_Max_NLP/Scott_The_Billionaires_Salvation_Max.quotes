935	948	949	949	She	192	“ I handled the serious stuff and you helped me lighten up . ”
1396	1403	1404	1404	he	13	“ Where are you , Mia ? ”
1412	1426	1404	1404	he	13	“ Do n’t do this to me . Please . I need you . ”
1644	1647	1636	1636	I	0	“ Mia ! ”
1670	1674	1666	1666	he	13	“ Come back . ”
1904	1918	1919	1919	he	13	“ I wo n’t give up on you , sweetheart . I promise , ”
1942	1948	1949	1949	His	13	“ I ’ll wait forever . ”

2232	2247	2248	2248	Max	13	“ I do n’t want a woman , Maddie . I ’m already married . ”
2332	2336	2328	2328	They	109	“ end of summer ”
2690	2699	2700	2700	she	15	“ I just want you to be happy , ”
2804	2850	2851	2851	Max	13	“ I feel the same way about Mia as you feel about Sam . I loved her . I still do . Her death did n’t change that . There is n’t anyone else for me , Maddie . She was my one and only . ”
2869	2884	2860	2860	she	15	“ I ca n’t be with anyone else . Not now . Not ever . ”
2885	2897	2921	2921	He	13	“ You feel that way now , Max , but someday — ”
2898	2920	2921	2921	He	13	“ I ’ll feel exactly the same way next year , ten years from now , and every day after that . ”
2984	3002	3003	3003	Her	15	“ If something happened to Sam , when would you be ready to be with someone else ? ”
3190	3193	3194	3194	Maddie	15	“ Never , ”
3213	3257	3198	3198	her	15	“ I ’d never be ready because Sam was the only man for me . I understand . And I ’m sorry . I just feel so damn helpless . I want to help , but I do n’t know what to do . ”
3315	3334	3310	3310	he	13	“ You already help me . Just by being my sister . I do n’t need anything else . ”
3372	3396	3365	3365	He	13	“ Hey . You two better break it up before Sam comes over here and breaks both your arms and kicks your ass . ”
3718	3730	3731	3731	Max	13	“ It ’s not my fault . You went with him , ”
3847	3856	3857	3857	she	15	“ Did you two have a good romp ? ”
3886	3906	3907	3907	Kade	219	“ Yeah . Tucker completely wiped me out and worked me out . The dog sets a brutal pace , ”
4217	4233	4234	4234	Maddie	15	“ Well , it was very sweet of you to take Tucker for some exercise , ”
4247	4277	4234	4234	Maddie	15	“ Hey , knock that off . Sam puts up with Max getting a little affection , but if you are n’t related , you better keep your distance . ”
4306	4316	4317	4317	Kade	219	“ We are related by marriage … sort of , ”
4339	4356	4357	4357	Simon	23	“ She ’s the sister of my brother - in - law . That should count . ”
4414	4430	4405	4405	he	219	“ Does n’t count . If you are n’t related by blood , forget it . ”
4439	4475	4431	4431	Kara	24	“ Kade ’s like family . Leave him alone , caveman . We happen to like it that he treats Maddie and I like sisters . I ’ve made Kade and Max my honorary brothers . ”
4482	4500	4501	4501	he	13	“ So can we come on over there and give you a brotherly little hug , Kara ? ”
4581	4596	4597	4597	Simon	23	“ Come one step closer and you ’ll both end up in the hospital , ”
4677	4681	4682	4682	Simon	23	“ Just wait , ”
4685	4689	4682	4682	Simon	23	“ Payback sucks . ”
5300	5303	5304	5304	he	13	“ Mia , ”
5352	5367	5368	5368	Kade	219	“ Do n’t do this to yourself , man . It is n’t her , ”
5406	5411	5412	5412	Max	13	“ I feel her , ”
5439	5505	5506	5506	Kade	219	“ Her eyes are the same color , but that ’s all . It is n’t her . Look at her , Max . She has short , dark hair . She ’s thin . Nothing is the same except her eyes . There are lots of women with blue eyes . Stop torturing yourself . Mia ’s gone and she ’s never coming back . ”
5748	5759	5760	5760	he	13	“ Wait . I just wanted to talk to you , ”
5849	5852	5853	5853	Max	13	“ Fuck . ”
5912	5917	5918	5918	he	13	“ Are you okay ? ”
5951	5958	5936	5936	her	192	“ You did n’t shave today . ”
6050	6053	6054	6054	He	13	“ Mia ? ”
6099	6110	6111	6111	she	192	“ No . I ’m not the woman you want , ”
6170	6180	6166	6166	he	13	“ No . Wake up . Stay with me . ”
6264	6280	6243	6243	Sam	13	“ Have you lost your damn mind ? Why did you take off like that ? ”
6290	6296	6281	6281	Kade	219	“ What happened to her ? ”
6297	6324	6328	6328	Kade	219	“ Fell . She ’s unconscious , smashed her head against the concrete . We need to get her to a hospital . Call an ambulance . ”
6528	6537	6510	6510	Kade	219	“ I can carry her for a while , ”
6557	6560	6561	6561	Max	13	“ No , ”
6604	6623	6600	6600	he	13	“ You ca n’t hang on to her until the ambulance gets here . It could take awhile . ”
6631	6638	6639	6639	Max	13	“ The hell I ca n’t , ”
6656	6673	6651	6651	he	13	“ She ’s my wife . I ’ll carry her as long as I need to . ”
6709	6716	6717	6717	Sam	13	“ You think that ’s Mia ? ”
6722	6727	6728	6728	Max	13	“ It is Mia , ”
6732	6742	6728	6728	Max	13	“ Max , she does n’t look like Mia — ”
6763	6768	6749	6749	Max	13	“ It ’s her . ”
6814	6819	6820	6820	Kade	219	“ Ambulance is coming , ”
6839	6860	6861	6861	Max	13	“ Max , I know you think that ’s Mia , but you must know that she really is n’t . ”
6884	6894	6895	6895	she	195	“ What happened ? Why are you carrying me ? ”
6898	6908	6909	6909	Max	13	“ You fell and hit your head , sweetheart , ”
6913	6921	6922	6922	she	195	“ Can you put me down please ? ”
6932	6940	6929	6929	he	13	“ Not happening . You ’re hurt . ”
6949	6982	6943	6943	she	195	“ Kade , can you tell Max that I ’m fine ? Where did you get that horrible shirt ? I think that ’s worse than the one with the purple birds . ”
6992	7021	6983	6983	Her	195	“ Why are Simon and Sam here ? Where the hell are we ? Dammit ! I feel like I got run over by a semi - truck . ”
7072	7076	7077	7077	Simon	23	“ Holy shit , ”
7150	7174	7175	7175	Maddie	15	“ Travis ? I need you to meet us at the hospital . We think we found Mia , and she ’s alive . ”
7283	7290	7268	7268	he	13	“ Are you hurt , sir ? ”
7334	7337	7338	7338	he	13	“ No , ”
7346	7350	7338	7338	he	13	“ Not anymore . ”
7669	7727	7728	7728	Maddie	15	“ I ’ve talked to all of her doctors , Max . Even the consulting psychiatrist . Her traumatic brain injury is fairly mild ; she ’s experiencing some symptoms of post - concussion syndrome with retrograde amnesia . She really does n’t remember the last two and a half years or what occurred during that time . ”
7768	7785	7760	7760	Max	13	“ Could you put that in layman ’s terms , Maddie ? What does it mean ? ”
7831	7896	7897	7897	She	192	“ It means when she smashed her head into the cement , it scrambled her brain around inside of her skull and screwed up some of the tiny cells that exist inside the brain . She ’s fine , Max . Really . There ’s nothing significant on her MRI . The headache and dizziness will eventually subside and her memory should come back . ”
8082	8092	8076	8076	Sam	13	“ We ’ll figure out what happened , Max . ”
8218	8250	8209	8209	he	106	“ You need to sleep , Max . You ’ve been here for two days straight . Go home and get some rest . Mia can go home in the morning . ”
8347	8360	8361	8361	he	106	“ I ’m staying . I ’ll sleep when we go home , ”
8377	8391	8361	8361	he	106	“ You two need to take off . I ’ll be fine here . ”
8501	8515	8516	8516	Maddie	15	“ I do n’t want to leave you alone here tonight , Max , ”
8588	8618	8619	8619	His	13	“ Thank you for being here when I needed you , but I ’m not alone anymore . Mia ’s here . I ’m exactly where I should be . ”
8641	8653	8654	8654	Sam	13	“ Take her home . She ’s pregnant with my nephew . ”
8657	8663	8664	8664	He	13	“ You mean my daughter ? ”
8676	8680	8681	8681	he	13	“ My nephew , ”
8765	8781	8753	8753	Sam	13	“ Now you can have one of your own , buddy . See you tomorrow . ”
9345	9351	9352	9352	he	13	“ What are you doing ? ”
9406	9428	9429	9429	She	13	“ Research . I ’m trying to find out more about what happened to me and why I ca n’t remember . ”
9495	9506	9475	9475	He	13	“ And what did you find out , Madame Detective ? ”
9507	9534	9535	9535	She	13	“ Not much . Nothing the doctors have n’t already told me . I did find it a little spooky reading about my own supposed death . ”
9548	9588	9535	9535	She	13	“ Losing over two years of my life is scary . It seems like just yesterday that we were attending the Bannister Charity Dinner , but I can feel the hole in my life , that everything ’s changed . ”
9595	9600	9589	9589	She	13	“ I ’ve changed . ”
9601	9619	9620	9620	Max	13	“ We ’ll figure it all out , sweetheart . I swear . Everything will be okay , ”
9637	9645	9646	9646	Her	13	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
9659	9676	9677	9677	Max	13	“ Obviously I have n’t been living a life of leisure . My hands are rough . ”
9695	9713	9677	9677	Max	13	“ You ’ve never lived a life of leisure . You ’re the busiest woman I know . ”
9742	9752	9753	9753	she	13	“ Oh well . At least I ’m thin , ”
9817	9830	9831	9831	he	13	“ It ’s nothing that some good Italian food wo n’t fix , ”
9841	9847	9838	9838	She	192	“ Pasta is my enemy . ”
9848	9853	9854	9854	he	13	“ You love it , ”
9935	9974	9932	9932	she	192	“ I had them do a DNA test . My brothers provided their blood for me to have it done . It would n’t be as conclusive as it would be if my mom was still alive but — ”
9975	9988	9932	9932	she	192	“ Why ? I know you ’re my wife . You know — “
9989	10013	9932	9932	she	192	“ I want you to know for certain . I disappeared for over two years . You deserve some sort of scientific proof . ”
10014	10039	10040	10040	he	250	“ I do n’t need it . I have no doubts . I knew the moment I saw you in the park , Mia , ”
10056	10064	10065	10065	Mia	192	“ I think my brother wants it , ”
10086	10089	10090	10090	Max	13	“ Travis , ”
10100	10118	10119	10119	Mia	192	“ No . I think Travis believes me . But I ’m not so sure about Kade , ”
10126	10137	10119	10119	Mia	192	“ Kade ? Why the fuck does he want it ? ”
10165	10171	10172	10172	he	219	“ I ’ll kill him , ”
10197	10244	10245	10245	Mia	192	“ He did n’t really ask . I offered . And I think it ’s important that we get rid of any doubts for a lot of reasons . Kade just seems different , distant , and hesitant to accept that I ’m really his sister . ”
10248	10283	10245	10245	Mia	192	“ Maybe it ’s just from the disappointment of the accident and his girlfriend breaking up with him . But he seems uncertain , and I do n’t want anyone to have any doubts . ”
10284	10292	10293	10293	Max	13	“ I ’m still fucking killing him , ”
10297	10314	10315	10315	Mia	192	“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever heard you drop the f - bomb before , ”
10319	10332	10333	10333	Max	13	“ Yeah … well … things have changed . I ’ve changed , ”
10352	10379	10380	10380	she	253	“ I ’m different , too . I remember our life together before I disappeared , but I do n’t feel like that same person anymore , ”
10391	10396	10380	10380	she	253	“ I ’m sorry . ”
10397	10400	10401	10401	Max	13	“ Hey . ”
10416	10445	10446	10446	He	13	“ It does n’t matter . I never stopped loving you . And I never will . We ’ll start over , get to know each other again . ”
10544	10547	10548	10548	she	253	“ Okay , ”
10552	10570	10571	10571	He	13	“ You should go home and get some rest . You look exhausted . Have you slept ? ”
10576	10593	10571	10571	He	13	“ Not much . And I ’m not leaving until I can take you home tomorrow . ”
10594	10603	10604	10604	she	253	“ You need sleep . You look tired , ”
10618	10623	10624	10624	he	13	“ I ’ll sleep , ”
10645	10648	10649	10649	He	13	“ Here . ”
10664	10671	10658	10658	She	253	“ Will you sleep with me ? ”
10726	10746	10722	10722	he	13	“ I stink . I have n’t showered and I ’ve been in the same clothes for two days . ”
10767	10785	10747	10747	Mia	192	“ Bathroom is over there and Maddie brought you clean clothes . They ’re in the drawer . ”
10830	10834	10835	10835	he	13	“ Five minutes , ”
10981	10990	10991	10991	he	257	“ Jesus . I missed this so much , ”
11030	11053	11054	11054	she	192	“ I do n’t remember us not being together , but I know that I missed it too . I love you , ”
11116	11136	11137	11137	His	257	“ I love you , too . I did n’t think I ’d ever get to hold you again . ”
11148	11158	11159	11159	she	192	“ I ’m not sure my nurse will approve , ”
11166	11173	11174	11174	he	257	“ Do n’t give a fuck , ”
11188	11193	11174	11174	he	257	“ Are you comfortable ? ”
11194	11202	11203	11203	she	192	“ Yes . You smell so good , ”
11210	11215	11203	11203	she	192	“ Are you okay ? ”
11216	11243	11244	11244	he	257	“ Hell , no . Hospital beds are like torture devices . But you could n’t blast me out of this position with dynamite right now , ”
11249	11265	11244	11244	he	257	“ And I owe Maddie a hell of a nice present for the clean clothes . ”
11266	11287	11288	11288	she	192	“ She ’s wonderful , Max . I ’m so happy you found each other . How did it happen ? ”
11299	11392	11292	11292	He	257	“ Fate . Or maybe just dumb luck . I saw her at Simon ’s wedding to Kara and she looked just like an old picture of our birth mother . It made me want to dig into my past and I finally found the proof that we were brother and sister . Unfortunately , she did n’t get adopted and she ’s had it pretty tough . I wish I had known earlier . I was just a baby when we were separated and neither one of us remembered the other . ”
11393	11399	11400	11400	Mia	192	“ She seems happy now , ”
11403	11420	11421	11421	Max	13	“ She is . How could she not be ? She has me for a brother , ”
11427	11456	11421	11421	Max	13	“ I know she ’s happy to have you as a brother , but I sort of think Sam has a little bit to do with it too , ”
11463	11571	11457	11457	Mia	192	“ They look so happy . Maddie told me some of their story . I never thought Sam would become so domesticated . I guess underneath the playboy exterior , he was always yearning for Maddie . I guess both Simon and Sam are finally happy . It seems so strange that everything has changed so much . It ’s almost like I went to sleep one night and woke up to an alternate universe . But I ’m glad both of them found the right woman . I ’m glad . I always worried about them . I wish that would happen for Kade and Travis . ”
11610	11617	11619	11619	he	219	“ I hope so , too . ”
11653	11682	11683	11683	Her	259	“ Will you stay for a while ? Until I remember or at least get used to the fact that I do n’t remember the last few years ? ”
11690	11702	11683	11683	Her	259	“ Everything just seems so dissimilar to what I can remember . ”
11703	11712	11713	11713	he	219	“ Sweetheart , I ’m staying all night , ”
11723	11774	11775	11775	Guilt	33	“ That ’s not what I meant . I was wondering if you could put off your business trips . Just for a little while . The media will have a field day with this , and I was hoping you might be able to stick around for a while . ”
11786	11795	11775	11775	Guilt	33	“ Mia , I ’m not going anywhere . ”
11796	11811	11812	11812	she	259	“ What about work , your plan to conquer the business and political world ? ”
11861	11882	11883	11883	He	13	“ I told you I ’ve changed . I do n’t want the same things as I wanted back then . ”
11892	11917	11889	11889	he	13	“ And I ’ve conquered everything I want to conquer in the business world . I do n’t need to travel like that anymore . ”
11941	11951	11930	11930	he	13	“ I ’m afraid you ’re stuck with me . ”
11952	11962	11963	11963	Mia	192	“ It will be nice to have you home , ”
11969	12005	11963	11963	Mia	192	“ I miss you so much when you ’re gone . I need you to help me get used to all the changes that have happened . I wish my memory would just come back . ”
12056	12068	12069	12069	he	13	“ You wo n’t have a chance to even miss me , ”
12082	12119	12078	12078	he	13	“ You ’re also going to be surrounded by security from this day forward . No arguments . No more going around unsecured . No more ducking our security . You ’re being protected . Always . ”
12120	12141	12142	12142	she	192	“ I know I ought to disagree , but I wo n’t . Not now . I ’m actually relieved , ”
12153	12167	12168	12168	he	13	“ And you are n’t going to be exposed to the media either , ”
12172	12193	12168	12168	he	13	“ I ’ll make a brief statement when the media finds out , and that ’s all they ’re getting . ”
12194	12211	12212	12212	Mia	192	“ I ’d rather avoid them for now . At least until I remember what happened . ”
12231	12237	12238	12238	Her	192	“ Max , are you … ”
12257	12301	12302	12302	he	13	“ Am I hard ? Yep . My cock is like granite right now . Everything about you arouses me , and I ’ve been without for over two years , sweetheart . So you need to quit squirming against me like that , ”
12305	12309	12310	12310	Her	192	“ Be still . ”
12320	12330	12316	12316	she	192	“ You didn’t … you never … nobody ever … ”
12337	12349	12331	12331	She	192	“ You did n’t sleep with anyone while I was gone ? ”
12350	12374	12375	12375	he	13	“ Nope . And I did n’t fuck anyone either . I had no desire to screw a woman who was n’t you , ”
12379	12388	12375	12375	he	13	“ But did n’t you ever want to — ”
12389	12417	12418	12418	Max	13	“ The only thing I wanted was my wife . So I got myself off thinking of you , because there was no one else I wanted . ”
12450	12456	12457	12457	She	192	“ Does that surprise you ? ”
12477	12490	12491	12491	Her	192	“ Actually , the thought of you doing that is pretty hot . ”
12527	12535	12536	12536	she	192	“ I wish I could have watched , ”
12625	12633	12634	12634	he	13	“ Go to sleep and behave yourself , ”
12646	12654	12634	12634	he	13	“ Okay . Promise you ’ll stay ? ”
12684	12688	12689	12689	Max	13	“ I promise . ”
12763	12776	12777	12777	Max	13	“ Are n’t you ever going to stop looking and buy something ? ”
12801	12811	12777	12777	Max	13	“ You ’ve been looking for over an hour . ”
12876	12878	12885	12885	she	192	“ off ”
13069	13076	13077	13077	she	192	“ Everything ’s so expensive here , ”
13089	13097	13098	13098	Max	13	“ I think I can afford it , ”
13240	13256	13233	13233	She	192	“ It just seems ridiculous to pay hundreds for a pair of jeans . Why ? ”
13257	13285	13286	13286	His	13	“ Why , why , why ? You ’re still the most inquisitive female I ’ve ever known and I think that ’s still your favorite word . ”
13303	13311	13312	13312	she	192	“ It just does n’t make sense , ”
13377	13394	13373	13373	he	13	“ What happened to the woman who bought her clothing without even checking the price tag ? ”
13415	13457	13458	13458	Mia	192	“ I ’m wealthy , Mia . Incredibly wealthy . And for that matter , so are you . Your grandmother ’s trust has done nothing but grow since you ’ve been gone . You never touched a penny of it . ”
13465	13511	13458	13458	Mia	192	“ I know that . I do n’t know why I feel the way I do . I know how I used to feel , and it was me ; it was who I was . Now I do n’t know who I am anymore . ”
13538	13559	13458	13458	Mia	192	“ I feel like I should pretend to be the way I was before because you loved me that way . ”
13560	13568	13569	13569	Max	13	“ I. Still . Love . You , ”
13585	13598	13599	13599	Mia	192	“ Do you think I give a fuck about your shopping habits ? ”
13692	13701	13682	13682	he	13	“ You dropped the f - bomb again , ”
13797	13804	13805	13805	he	13	“ Does my cursing bother you ? ”
13821	13824	13825	13825	she	14	“ No , ”
13913	13924	13925	13925	he	13	“ Good . Then I do n’t give a fuck , ”
14126	14152	14107	14107	She	14	“ Shit . We ’re in the middle of a goddamn mall and I ’m ready to tear your clothes off and fuck you blind . ”
14162	14172	14173	14173	Mia	192	“ I did n’t think you wanted to anymore , ”
14180	14231	14173	14173	Mia	192	“ Oh , I want to . You have no idea the things I want to do to you . I ’m just not sure you ’re ready for it . I told you I ’ve changed , Mia . And I ’m not sure I can control myself anymore . ”
14265	14270	14271	14272	Sweet Jesus	26	“ Then do n’t . ”
14334	14339	14323	14323	she	192	“ I need you . ”
14389	14395	14396	14396	he	13	“ I ’m losing it , ”
14409	14426	14427	14427	he	13	“ Find some stuff . Walk away , Mia , before I embarrass both of us , ”
14867	14886	14887	14887	she	192	“ Are you upset about what happened ? I know you hate undignified displays of affection in public , ”
14901	14915	14916	14916	he	293	“ Hell no , I ’m not upset . I ’m pissed off , ”
14920	14923	14924	14924	Mia	192	“ Why ? ”
14934	14944	14945	14945	he	293	“ Because I could n’t finish what I started , ”
14955	14977	14945	14945	he	293	“ You have no idea how close you just came to being fucked up against a wall by your desperate husband . ”
14978	14986	14987	14987	she	192	“ There was always the dressing room , ”
15041	15047	15029	15029	he	13	“ Now you tell me . ”
15048	15055	15056	15056	she	192	“ Would you have done it ? ”
15070	15081	15082	15082	he	13	“ In a heartbeat , had I thought of it , ”
15115	15124	15125	15125	Mia	192	“ We could n’t have done that anyway , ”
15129	15140	15141	15141	Max	13	“ Unless you ’re carrying a condom in your pocket . ”
15148	15158	15141	15141	Max	13	“ Why ? We ’ve never needed one before . ”
15171	15193	15159	15159	Mia	192	“ Because we do n’t know what happened to me , Max . You have no idea what could have happened . ”
15194	15202	15203	15203	Max	13	“ Are you afraid you were unfaithful ? ”
15209	15212	15213	15213	she	192	“ No , ”
15216	15267	15213	15213	she	192	“ Whatever happened , I know myself , maybe better than I ever did before , and I never had thoughts about being with any other man but you . I love you the same way you love me . But we do n’t know if I was abducted or … ”
15284	15327	15279	15279	she	192	“ raped . I ca n’t put you at risk , Max . Not until I know for sure exactly what happened . I ’ll see my doctor and get a check - up , but I need to regain my memory . ”
15340	15382	15383	15383	His	13	“ You will . Sweetheart , you know if something did happen , I ’ll kill whoever did it . And it wo n’t make a bit of difference in how I feel about you . Tell me you know that . ”
15390	15401	15402	15402	she	192	“ If it happened , it was n’t by choice , ”
15411	15437	15402	15402	she	192	“ I love you , Max . So very much it hurts . It makes my skin crawl just thinking about being with anyone else . ”
15454	15461	15438	15438	Max	13	“ You ’ll be with me . ”
15462	15467	15468	15468	God	20	“ I ca n’t . ”
15481	15498	15499	15499	he	13	“ I ’ll empty every drugstore in Tampa and the surrounding area of their condom supply , ”
15571	15581	15560	15560	She	192	“ Kind of ambitious , do n’t you think ? ”
15582	15587	15588	15588	he	13	“ Not at all , ”
15593	15607	15588	15588	he	13	“ I ’m thinking I might need more flown in from other cities . ”
15644	15655	15668	15668	he	13	“ Thinking about finishing what we started in the mall ? ”
15656	15667	15668	15668	he	13	“ Yeah . And then starting it all over again , ”
15693	15703	15689	15689	Mia	192	“ Later . You can definitely finish it later . ”
15704	15709	15710	15710	Max	13	“ Count on it , ”
15770	15784	15785	15785	Mia	192	“ I ca n’t find my wedding ring . I ’ve searched everywhere , ”
15812	15830	15831	15831	Max	13	“ You had to have been wearing it when you disappeared . It ’s never been here , ”
15879	15898	15873	15873	he	13	“ Why would I take it off if I was wearing it ? I never took it off . ”
15899	15903	15904	15904	he	13	“ I know , ”
15908	15915	15904	15904	he	13	“ I wondered about that myself . ”
15985	15991	15992	15992	she	192	“ I ca n’t remember , ”
16023	16046	16012	16012	Max	13	“ Tell me what happened after I disappeared . Were there ever any clues to where I went , what I did ? ”
16047	16050	16051	16051	Max	13	“ No , ”
16055	16070	16071	16071	He	13	“ The last thing you remember happened a week or two before you disappeared . ”
16086	16144	16071	16071	He	13	“ I ’m not even completely sure what day you vanished . I found your things on the beach the day I came home from an overnight business trip . It could have been the day I left or the following day . I came home late . I hated myself for ever leaving on that trip . ”
16154	16179	16145	16145	He	13	“ Max , it was n’t your fault . You were considering running for public office , and you had business out of town — ”
16180	16229	16071	16071	He	13	“ It was bullshit . All of it . I never wanted to be a politician , and I could have left most of the traveling to upper management . I was a goddamn coward , Mia . I took those trips to take a break from us . ”
16280	16292	16273	16273	he	13	“ Was I suffocating you because I loved you too much ? ”
16401	16437	16382	16382	Max	13	“ It was n’t you ; it was me . I wanted to be smothered by you ; I wanted to be the only man you saw , the only man who existed for you . ”
16438	16445	16393	16393	he	13	“ But Max , you were — ”
16446	16452	16453	16453	he	13	“ It was n’t enough , ”
16478	16579	16582	16582	God	20	“ The things I wanted were n’t right in my mind . My dad loved my mom and treated her with tenderness and devotion . Although I felt those things too , there was also this total obsession that I did n’t think was right , natural . You ’re my wife , a woman who deserves my respect . I never wanted you to leave me . I did n’t want to scare you away by acting like a lunatic . The way I felt was n’t rational . I wanted to kill any man who looked at you . ”
16664	16674	16675	16675	she	309	“ So you ’re really a closet dominant male ? ”
16788	16835	16836	16836	he	311	“ I think I ’m beyond that , and I do n’t think I ’m in the closet anymore . And I ’m still perfectly rational with everyone and everything except you . You ’re the only woman who ’s ever made me feel this way , ”
17047	17067	17022	17022	they	315	“ You can be whoever you really are with me , Max . I ’ll never stop loving you . ”
17068	17180	17181	17181	Max	13	“ I think that ’s the problem . I was never truly alive until I met you . I was the guy who never lost his temper , never let emotions get in the way of a business deal , and I was pretty much indifferent about everything . The only thing I wanted was to be a good son to my adoptive parents because they had given me so much . I guess I thought I needed to be in their image , act like a Hamilton , to make up for the fact that I was n’t their blood child . I did n’t even know who I was , ”
17184	17194	17195	17195	Mia	192	“ And do you know who you are now ? ”
17212	17216	17217	17217	he	13	“ Not completely , ”
17224	17267	17217	17217	he	13	“ But I can guarantee you that I ’m not indifferent , especially not when it comes to you . I know exactly how I feel about you . I always have . I just was n’t sure you could handle it . ”
17268	17272	17273	17273	she	192	“ I can , ”
17294	17307	17285	17285	she	192	“ Tell me what happened after you found out I was missing . ”
17317	17375	17308	17308	Max	13	“ Obviously , there was an extensive search , but it only lasted about a week because there were no leads . After that , they were convinced you had either drowned or there was only one possible suspect if you were murdered . They were n’t really looking at other possibilities because nothing else made sense . ”
17376	17379	17380	17380	she	192	“ Who ? ”
17386	17389	17390	17390	he	13	“ Me , ”
17399	17420	17390	17390	he	13	“ A woman with no real enemies vanishes and ca n’t be found , the usual suspect is her husband . ”
17421	17433	17441	17441	him	13	“ Oh , God . Max , I ’m so sorry . ”
17451	17464	17465	17465	Max	13	“ There was no motive , no reason to even suspect you . ”
17468	17568	17569	17569	Tears	35	“ Crime of passion ? Another woman ? Another man ? Money ? Believe me … they checked every possibility , dug through every record to make sure I had n’t done anything to you for any of those reasons . When they finally decided I was n’t guilty , they assumed you had drowned . They said they did n’t suspect foul play . There was never a demand for ransom , no reason to believe you were abducted . There was no activity on any of your accounts . It was like you had just … vanished . ”
17615	17623	17601	17601	she	192	“ The media must have been horrible . ”
17624	17649	17651	17651	she	192	“ Luckily I was spared that part of it . They kept the investigation quiet . I cooperated , gave them whatever they wanted . ”
17708	17726	17704	17704	she	192	“ I wish I could remember . I wish I knew why I did this to you . ”
17750	17790	17727	17727	Max	13	“ Hey , do n’t cry . You do n’t know what your reason was or what happened . Do n’t blame yourself . I survived . You ’re here now . That ’s all that matters to me . ”
17806	17827	17802	17802	she	192	“ Why are you still wearing your ring ? You must have given up hope , thought I was dead . ”
17918	17974	17907	17907	he	13	“ I never gave up hope . Right after you disappeared , I made a promise to you that I ’d never give up . I could n’t . In my heart , I never accepted that you were dead . I guess I thought that if you really were , I would feel it . ”
18090	18102	18080	18080	she	192	“ I want to remember . I have to know why . ”
18127	18148	18122	18122	his	13	“ Stop it , Mia . Stop doing this to yourself . You ’ll remember and everything will be fine . ”
18550	18558	18537	18537	Mia	192	“ Something ’s not right , Tucker , ”
18608	18620	18594	18594	she	192	“ Has he been playing like this while I was gone ? ”
18686	18691	18692	18692	she	192	“ Go to him , ”
19224	19227	19228	19228	he	13	“ Mia , ”
19241	19253	19254	19254	he	13	“ She ’s here somewhere . She has to be here , ”
19284	19290	19291	19291	he	13	“ No . Fuck no , ”
19341	19348	19330	19330	he	13	“ No , goddammit . No . ”
19430	19443	19414	19414	her	349	“ Max . Shit . You scared the hell out of me . ”
19469	19476	19477	19477	he	13	“ Get out of the water , ”
19493	19496	19497	19497	He	13	“ Now ! ”
19518	19533	19511	19511	She	349	“ I ’m close to shore . The water is barely over my head , ”
19545	19548	19534	19534	she	349	“ Move . ”
19823	19826	19827	19827	His	13	“ Mine . ”
19983	19986	19987	19987	Mia	192	“ Max ? ”
20049	20068	20069	20069	he	13	“ You ’ll never set foot on this beach again . Never . I fucking hate this place , ”
20152	20172	20173	20173	she	192	“ I ’ll make sure someone else is here . I promise . You know I love it here , ”
20176	20181	20182	20182	he	13	“ I hate it , ”
20200	20210	20211	20211	she	192	“ Let me go . Let me touch you , ”
20215	20232	20211	20211	she	192	“ No . I ’m going to fuck you here . Right here . Right now . ”He
20246	20275	20211	20211	she	192	“ I ’m going to taste you first until you beg for my cock , and then I ’ll fuck you until you beg for mercy , sweetheart . ”
20364	20367	20368	20368	she	192	“ Condom , ”
20372	20379	20368	20368	she	192	“ We need to get some . ”
20411	20419	20420	20420	he	297	“ It was my first goddamn priority , ”
20442	20454	20433	20433	she	192	“ Good . Then fuck me . And make me come , ”
20523	20554	20555	20555	he	297	“ Sweetheart , there ’s no question about whether or not you ’ll come . You will … and you ’ll be screaming my name while you ’re doing it , ”
20682	20689	20690	20690	she	192	“ I ’m not a screamer , ”
20701	20706	20707	20707	he	297	“ You will be , ”
20734	20739	20740	20740	he	297	“ Do n’t move , ”
20954	20964	20965	20965	she	192	“ Y - you actually want me to scream , ”
21042	21058	21059	21059	he	13	“ Oh hell , yeah . Scream , moan , beg , come for me , ”
21081	21088	21067	21067	he	13	“ I want to hear you . ”
21089	21094	21095	21095	she	192	“ We ’re outside , ”
21108	21115	21116	21116	he	13	“ You want me to stop ? ”
21154	21159	21160	21160	Her	192	“ No . Please . ”
21172	21181	21160	21160	Her	192	“ I need you , Max . Now . ”
21182	21188	21189	21189	he	13	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
21210	21222	21223	21223	he	13	“ You belong to me , Mia . You always have , ”
21387	21401	21402	21402	he	13	“ This is mine . So feminine . So sweet . So delicious , ”
21470	21479	21480	21480	He	13	“ Oh God , please Max . Please . ”
21617	21622	21613	21613	She	192	“ Max . Please . ”
21637	21645	21623	21623	She	192	“ Fuck me , Max . Please . ”
21816	21825	21791	21791	She	192	“ Max . Oh , yes . Max . ”
21935	21946	21947	21947	Max	13	“ I think you ’re the sexiest woman on earth , ”
21956	21988	21947	21947	Max	13	“ Hearing you moan , scream my name , making you come . Fuck . There ’s no better feeling in the world . Except maybe having my cock inside you . ”
22052	22060	22037	22037	Max	13	“ Fuck me , Max . Please . ”
22061	22095	22096	22096	he	302	“ Tell me you need me , Mia . ’Cause I know I fucking need you . I have to know you want me as much as I burn for you right now , ”
22207	22223	22224	22224	Mia	192	“ I need you . I need you so much I ca n’t stand it , ”
22232	22245	22224	22224	Mia	192	“ I love you , Max . Always have . Always will . ”
22392	22412	22413	22413	he	13	“ And I love you , my beautiful , sexy Mia . Do n’t ever leave me alone again , ”
22427	22447	22413	22413	he	13	“ I wo n’t . I promise . Fuck me , Max . I ca n’t wait any longer . ”
22485	22507	22508	22508	She	192	“ You fuck me , sweetheart . I want to see you . I want to watch you come this time . ”
22618	22637	22612	22612	he	13	“ Oh , hell yeah . Touch me . Make me believe you ’re really with me again , ”
22660	22669	22638	22638	Max	13	“ No . Fucking . Better . Feeling . ”
22762	22765	22766	22766	she	192	“ Max , ”
22917	22927	22928	22928	Max	13	“ Come for me , sweetheart . Let go , ”
22995	23004	22981	22981	She	192	“ It ’s too much . Too much . ”
23029	23036	23037	23037	he	13	“ Never enough . Never enough , ”
23184	23190	23181	23181	she	192	“ Still hate this beach ? ”
23191	23208	23209	23209	he	13	“ No . But now every time I come out here my cock will be hard , ”
23229	23239	23226	23226	she	192	“ Good . I ’ll come out with you . ”
23240	23246	23247	23247	he	13	“ You damn well better , ”
23267	23289	23260	23260	she	192	“ You ’ve certainly developed quite the potty mouth , Mr. Hamilton . I never knew you could talk that naughty . ”
23290	23302	23303	23303	Max	13	“ I ’m not quite sure I can restrain it anymore , ”
23311	23319	23303	23303	Max	13	“ You ’ve always made me crazy . ”
23320	23353	23354	23354	she	192	“ Then do n’t hold back . I love you , Max . Nothing between us is wrong . You can talk dirty to me any time . It turns me on , ”
23369	23379	23358	23358	she	192	“ Then I ’ll never try to control it . ”
23399	23422	23423	23423	His	13	“ Do n’t come out here alone , Mia . I ca n’t lose you again . I wo n’t survive it . ”
23477	23485	23470	23470	she	192	“ I wo n’t . I promise . ”
23504	23511	23512	23512	Max	13	“ See that you do n’t , ”
23591	23599	23600	23600	he	13	“ I ’ll never let you go , ”
23627	23642	23643	23643	she	192	“ The condoms . You did n’t grab them . We might need them , ”
23679	23700	23701	23701	He	13	“ Sweetheart , do you think I do n’t have some stashed in every nook and cranny of this house ? ”
23708	23718	23701	23701	He	13	“ I did mention that it was a priority . ”
23752	23758	23759	23759	she	192	“ Still feeling pretty ambitious ? ”
23771	23776	23777	23777	he	13	“ Depraved and deprived , ”
23783	23793	23794	23794	she	192	“ I think we can take care of that , ”
23805	23814	23815	23815	he	13	“ Oh , I ’m planning on it , ”
23839	23851	23829	23829	She	192	" Billionaire ’s Wife Returns From The Dead With No Memory ! ”
23878	23884	23885	23885	she	192	“ I hate the media , ”
23968	24013	23965	23965	he	13	“ Hey , do n’t let it upset you , sweetheart . I ’ll give a statement , they ’ll be hot on our trail for a while , and then they ’ll find something more interesting to write about . They always do . ”
24097	24123	24124	24124	Her	192	“ I ’m sorry . I know it ’s part of our life , but they never let up after what happened with my parents … ”
24257	24276	24277	24277	he	13	“ They wo n’t drag it up , Mia . I ’ll kill the first person who does , ”
24370	24405	24349	24349	Max	13	“ I do n’t care about me . I can handle it . I do n’t want them to talk about it because it would be hard on you , Kade , and Travis . ”
24424	24434	24435	24435	Max	13	“ Me ? Why the hell would I care ? ”
24448	24471	24435	24435	Max	13	“ I ’m your wife . You ’re a billionaire businessman . I ’ve always tried to be the woman you need — ”
24472	24480	24481	24481	he	13	“ You are the woman I need , ”
24490	24504	24481	24481	he	13	“ I do n’t care who your parents were or what they did . ”
24505	24572	24574	24574	God	20	“ My father was insane . He shot my mother and then put the gun in his mouth and blew his brains out . You think they wo n’t wonder about my sanity ? Whether I ’m a little crazy too ? I ’m coming back from the dead , a big hole in my memory . I ’m sure people will judge by my history . ”
24580	24588	24589	24589	Max	13	“ It ’s not your goddamn history , ”
24602	24638	24589	24589	Max	13	“ And anyone who judges you by something your parents did is n’t somebody we need to give a shit about . You , Kade , and Travis are n’t made from the same mold . ”
24639	24680	24681	24681	She	397	“ I ’ve always tried to be careful , tried not to draw attention to myself . I wanted to be a good wife to you , Max . I tried to change . I do n’t know what happened . ”
24733	24746	24747	24747	Max	13	“ Did you feel like you needed to change because of me ? ”
24755	24781	24747	24747	Max	13	“ Yes . No . I do n’t know . I wanted to be perfect . I slipped sometimes , did something stupid or thoughtless . ”
24806	24838	24839	24839	she	397	“ Every time I got a lecture from you , I tried to laugh it off , but I tried to do better . But you were just so damned perfect , ”
24869	24872	24873	24873	Mia	192	“ What ? ”
24903	24950	24898	24898	he	13	“ Sweetheart , I ’m far from perfect . Do you realize that I think we were both trying to fit the mold that we assumed was the other ’s ideal ? It would be even more fucking hilarious if it was n’t a little heartbreaking . ”
24984	24991	24992	24992	Max	13	“ Tell me what you did . ”
25030	25186	25189	25189	her	404	“ I waxed . I hated it , but I screamed my way through it , cursing the woman doing it in my head as a sadist . And I tried to stop being so clumsy . I got up every day and primped , even though I just wanted to wear a tank top without a bra and a crappy pair of shorts and get to work . I dieted , trying to be slender , feeling like I was starving to death most of the time . I stopped cursing because I thought it offended you , although I came close to slipping occasionally . I was raised with two brothers , and watching what I said was difficult . And I bought clothes because they were trendy , not because I liked them . I bit my tongue at parties , even when I did n’t agree with what people were saying . ”
25215	25463	25464	25464	he	405	“ One : I did n’t like the waxing , but if you wanted it , I did n’t care . Two : You ’re not clumsy — you’re absolutely adorable . I think I fell in love with you the moment you spilled your coffee on my favorite suit , which never did recover . But I got you out of the deal , so I did n’t give a shit about the suit . Three : All of your make - up was washed off when you jumped into the ocean last night , and your hair is wild like you ’ve been well - satisfied . And you take my breath away . I ’m all for the shorts and braless look , just know I might never leave the house after I see those incredible breasts . Four : You do n’t need to diet . Your figure was full and beautiful ; you ’re active and healthy . Most of the time , I was fighting for control . Five : I want you to wear whatever you want and be exactly who you are . If some uptight prick at a party pisses you off , tell him off . Six : I could n’t care less if you curse . Especially if you want to talk dirty to me . But know that I ’ll take you exactly where you happen to be at that moment if you do that , ”
25479	25535	25468	25468	He	405	“ I fell in love with you , Mia . I do n’t need you to be anyone other than who you are . I felt the distance growing after we were married , but I thought it was me . I was trying too hard to be the sensible man I assumed you wanted . ”
25546	25565	25541	25541	she	192	“ What did you do ? You told me about the trips to distance yourself . What else ? ”
25566	25662	25663	25663	he	406	“ I did a lot of little things , like shaving twice a day , but leaving was the worst part . It nearly killed me to leave , but I always felt like I needed to get a grip because you wanted a steady husband instead of a maniacal beast who was obsessed with the woman he loved . To me , you ’ve always been perfect , and I could never be good enough to deserve you . So instead , I ran away when I could n’t get my emotions under control , ”
25672	25718	25663	25663	he	406	“ I was n’t raised to show my emotions openly . And what I felt for you was n’t normal for me . I was terrified if you really knew how I felt … you’d run like hell . Most women would … or should . ”
25719	25768	25769	25769	Mia	192	“ I would n’t . I felt the same way , Max . I always have . But I guess I was convinced that you needed the perfect wife , and I was going to have to compromise or mold myself into that image to keep your love , ”
25783	25811	25812	25812	Max	13	“ You were worldly , sophisticated , and completely controlled . I did n’t want to smother you with emotion . And I felt … too much . ”
25838	25885	25886	25886	His	13	“ Suffocate me , Mia . Let me drown in your love and affection . Touch me . Shower me with your laughter . That ’s all I ’ve ever wanted . I need that from you . I just want to be close to you . ”
25893	25896	25897	25897	he	13	“ Please , ”
25975	26028	26029	26029	she	409	“ I think I ’ve grown up , Max . I ’m not sure what happened to me , but I do n’t want to change anymore . If you think you can handle me , I ’ll give you all the love I have and leave you begging for a reprieve , ”
26034	26051	26052	26052	His	408	“ And I love you a whole hell of a lot . Can you handle that ? ”
26066	26070	26052	26052	His	408	“ Oh yeah . ”
26118	26136	26115	26115	she	192	“ Love me just like this forever . It ’s all I ’ve ever wanted , too . ”
26148	26157	26137	26137	Max	13	“ I will , sweetheart . I promise . ”
26332	26351	26352	26352	Sam	13	“ How damn long does it take to have a baby ? She ’s been in labor forever , ”
26418	26431	26432	26432	Mia	192	“ It ’s her first baby , Sam . It takes time , ”
26485	26497	26466	26466	She	192	“ Do you hate me for having some doubts at first ? ”
26506	26537	26538	26538	she	192	“ You ’re my brother . I love you . I was presumed dead . So no , I do n’t hate you because you did n’t immediately accept me , ”
26610	26701	26702	26702	Kade	219	“ I was an asshole . I knew it was you from the moment you criticized my shirt and called me by name in the park , but all I could think about was what would happen if Max got attached and something happened . He was a mess , Squirt . He walked around like an empty shell , like he did n’t care if he lived or died . Honestly , I do n’t think he did care . I did n’t want to see him suffer anymore , ”
26754	26784	26751	26751	she	192	“ I ’m twenty - nine years old , almost thirty . Do n’t you think it ’s time to stop referring to me by that stupid childhood nickname ? ”
26860	26869	26853	26853	Kade	219	“ Nope . You ’re still a squirt . ”
26870	26878	26879	26879	she	192	“ And you still wear bad shirts , ”
27028	27064	27022	27022	Kade	219	“ I just do n’t want you to think I ’m not happy to have you back . I am . More than I can say . But I was worried about Max , too . ”
27079	27086	27065	27065	She	124	“ I ’m glad . Really . ”
27111	27147	27148	27148	Kade	219	“ He loves you , Mia . It just sucks that now I ’ll have to put up with all three of them acting like idiots over their women , one of them my sister . ”
27174	27179	27180	27180	she	192	“ You ’ll survive , ”
27249	27257	27258	27258	Max	13	“ What are you two talking about ? ”
27296	27322	27323	27323	Kade	219	“ Squirt refuses to feel sorry for me because I have to deal with you , Sam , and Simon freaking out about your females , ”
27327	27338	27339	27339	Max	13	“ You ’re still on my shit list , buddy , ”
27346	27387	27339	27339	Max	13	“ I ’m offering a temporary truce because of the situation , but I still plan to pound you the first chance I get . If you said one word to upset her , I ’ll make you regret it . ”
27388	27398	27399	27399	Kade	219	“ Yeah . Let ’s see you try it , ”
27405	27421	27399	27399	Kade	219	“ I might have a lame leg , but I can still kick your ass . ”
27422	27439	27440	27440	Max	13	“ No mercy because of your leg . I ’m not going easy because of it , ”
27444	27449	27440	27440	Max	13	“ It ’s healed . ”
27450	27476	27477	27477	Kade	219	“ I did n’t expect you to . Give it your all . Just have an ambulance on standby when you decide to try it , ”
27519	27525	27526	27526	she	192	“ Both of you stop , ”
27529	27538	27539	27539	She	192	“ We ’re here for a happy occasion . ”
27545	27575	27539	27539	She	192	“ Kade was concerned about you . I do n’t blame him for that . I ’m glad he was trying to protect you , because I love you . ”
27589	27606	27581	27581	she	192	“ And you behave . You ’re deliberately provoking him , and it ’s not amusing . ”
27650	27658	27647	27647	Kade	219	“ Kiss and make up , man . ”
27673	27683	27684	27684	Max	13	“ Fine . I ’ll kick your ass later , ”
27718	27729	27730	27730	she	192	“ I ’m glad you two can act like adults , ”
27734	27741	27742	27742	Max	13	“ Do I have a choice ? ”
27751	27761	27762	27762	Her	192	“ Not if you want to get some later . ”
27778	27794	27795	27795	Mia	192	“ Sweetheart , for that , I ’d get down on my knees and beg . ”
27820	27836	27837	27837	Kade	219	“ Shit . Give me a break . TMI . She ’s my damn sister . ”
27849	27860	27843	27843	he	219	“ I ’m going for coffee . Anybody want anything ? ”
27861	27864	27865	27865	she	192	“ Coffee , ”
27881	27884	27885	27885	Mia	192	“ Addict , ”
27891	27899	27900	27900	he	219	“ I caught the addiction from you , ”
27949	27964	27965	27965	she	15	“ She ’s beautiful . Eight pounds , one ounce , and completely healthy , ”
27981	27985	27986	27986	Sam	13	“ Kara okay ? ”
27991	28002	28003	28003	Maddie	15	“ She ’s fine . Worn out , but good , ”
28006	28034	28035	28035	Mia	192	“ If I can tear him away , I ’ll get Simon to bring the baby out of the delivery room so you can all see her . ”
28042	28052	28035	28035	Mia	192	“ I ’m sure he ’s a proud daddy . ”
28053	28091	28092	28092	Maddie	15	“ He will be . He ’s a little green around the gills at the moment . I did n’t think he was going to make it through the delivery . Kara was calmer than he was , ”
28156	28163	28150	28150	he	13	“ Your turn next , buddy . ”
28183	28193	28194	28194	he	13	“ I do n’t think I can do it , ”
28204	28218	28219	28219	Maddie	15	“ You do n’t have to do it . I ’m doing it , ”
28223	28250	28219	28219	Maddie	15	“ Since everybody is here , I guess we can tell you all . Sam and I are being twice blessed . We ’re having twins . ”
28251	28255	28256	28256	Mia	192	“ Oh shit , ”
28376	28390	28391	28391	she	192	“ Congratulations , Maddie . We ’ll help the guys get through it , ”
28407	28413	28414	28414	Maddie	15	“ I just told Sam , ”
28421	28430	28414	28414	Maddie	15	“ He ’ll warm to the idea eventually . ”
28445	28449	28437	28437	his	13	“ Or not , ”
28522	28531	28532	28532	she	464	“ I wish I could have your baby , ”
28536	28563	28564	28564	Max	13	“ Sweetheart , you do n’t say something like that to me and not expect me to respond accordingly . I thought you wanted to wait , ”
28599	28612	28589	28589	she	464	“ I know we were waiting to have a family , but — ”
28613	28636	28637	28637	he	13	“ I ’m ready if you are . I think we ’ve waited long enough to start really living our lives together , ”
28649	28654	28655	28655	she	464	“ Me , too , ”
28722	28735	28736	28736	she	464	“ When I recover my memory , we can talk about it , ”
28739	28760	28736	28736	she	464	“ We do need some time after all that ’s happened , but it would be nice to plan it . ”
28761	28775	28776	28776	Max	13	“ I ’ll be more than happy to do my part to help , ”
28796	28817	28818	28818	she	464	“ You ’ll be my stud once I know what happened and we know everything is going to be okay ? ”
28822	28844	28845	28845	he	13	“ Baby , I am your stud . The only one you ’ll ever need . And everything will be fine , ”
28849	28863	28864	28864	she	464	“ We ca n’t exactly get started immediately , but you could practice , ”
28934	28947	28948	28948	she	464	“ You have condoms in the car ? You really are prepared , ”
28960	28967	28968	28968	he	13	“ I was a Boy Scout , ”
29080	29101	29102	29102	she	192	“ No ! Do n’t hurt him . I ’ll do whatever you want . Just leave my family alone , ”
29127	29176	29177	29177	He	150	“ Easy shot . A few hundred yards . I could take him out in less than ten seconds and then go pick off both your brothers , too , before anybody even realizes what happened . The security of these rich pukes is n’t worth a shit . ”
29200	29212	29185	29186	Danny Harvey	219	“ You wo n’t get away with it . The police — ”
29213	29252	29253	29253	he	150	“ Wo n’t do you a damn bit of good after they ’re dead . And I doubt they ’ll pay much attention before that . Everyone knows about the crazy Harrisons . They ’ll never find me , ”
29257	29266	29277	29277	he	150	“ Are you willing to take that chance ? ”
29281	29324	29277	29277	he	150	“ You do n’t love any of them , Mia . Not like you love me . You want me . You married that rich suit as a substitute . I ’m here now . Cooperate and we can be together again . ”
29337	29345	29325	29325	She	192	“ What do you want , Danny ? ”
29346	29357	29358	29358	he	150	“ You . We belong together . We always have , ”
29363	29368	29369	29369	she	192	“ And my money , ”
29424	29436	29405	29405	he	150	“ That ’s just a side benefit . I love you . ”
29666	29678	29679	29679	he	219	“ I can think of a better use for that mouth , ”
29711	29721	29686	29686	He	219	“ Suck me . You know you want to . ”
30206	30210	30211	30211	he	13	“ Miss me ? ”
30221	30234	30211	30211	he	13	“ You should have woken me up and taken me with you . ”
30328	30337	30338	30338	she	192	“ Bad dream . I was all sweaty , ”
30353	30371	30379	30379	he	13	“ Then you definitely should have woken me up . I love being all sweaty with you . ”
30398	30405	30379	30379	he	13	“ Hey . Are you okay ? ”
30406	30414	30415	30415	she	192	“ Yeah . I ’m good now , ”
30884	30892	30895	30895	He	13	“ Mia . I wo n’t last . ”
31106	31113	31114	31114	he	13	“ Come with me , Mia , ”
31145	31150	31151	31151	His	13	“ Come with me . ”
31342	31345	31346	31346	he	13	“ Shit , ”
31362	31365	31366	31366	he	13	“ Mia , ”
31444	31454	31433	31433	he	13	“ This better be important . It ’s early , ”
31463	31468	31469	31469	Max	13	“ Mia ’s missing , ”
31474	31479	31469	31469	Max	13	“ Is she there ? ”
31480	31496	31497	31497	Kade	219	“ Hell no , she ’s not here . I was sleeping . What happened ? ”
31513	31535	31504	31504	Max	13	“ Nothing happened . She ’s just not here . Nobody saw her leave . Neither of the cars is missing . ”
31564	31572	31573	31573	Max	13	“ Hold on . I found something , ”
31650	31655	31656	31656	Max	13	“ What the fuck ? ”
31674	31680	31681	31681	Kade	219	“ What ? What happened ? ”
31689	31707	31708	31708	Max	13	“ She ’s left me . On purpose . She does n’t want to be married anymore , ”
31734	31737	31738	31738	Kade	219	“ Bullshit , ”
31746	31759	31738	31738	Kade	219	“ She ’s in love with you . You know she is . ”
31760	31774	31775	31775	Max	13	“ I ca n’t make her stay if she does n’t want to , ”
31785	31800	31775	31775	Max	13	“ She never wanted to be with me . She just did n’t remember . ”
31801	31832	31833	31833	Kade	219	“ You never gave up on her , man . Not once . Do n’t give up now . There ’s something going on that we do n’t know about , ”
31851	31885	31886	31886	Max	13	“ Nobody forced her to write that note . Nobody is forcing her to leave . She made her fucking choice . Twice . Obviously she remembered that she did n’t love me , ”
31952	31976	31977	31977	Kade	219	“ Max , you know her . You know this is n’t Mia . We need to figure out what ’s going on , ”
32025	32038	32039	32039	he	219	“ Truth is , maybe I never really knew her at all , ”
32242	32247	32248	32248	Travis	219	“ Where is she ? ”
32263	32266	32257	32257	he	219	“ Who ? ”
32267	32270	32271	32271	Kade	219	“ Mia , ”
32335	32358	32327	32327	his	219	“ She could n’t have done this alone . And there ’s only one person I know who could pull this off . ”
32429	32449	32423	32423	Travis	219	“ Two disappearances with no sign of her ? Where is she , Travis ? This is killing Max . ”
32465	32477	32450	32450	Travis	219	“ What do you mean … two ? She ’s back . ”
32478	32484	32485	32485	Kade	219	“ She ’s gone again , ”
32538	32552	32526	32526	they	1055	“ Shit . I brought her back . Did she recover her memory ? ”
32567	32576	32553	32553	Travis	219	“ Yeah . What difference does that make ? ”
32581	32619	32620	32620	Travis	219	“ It makes all the difference . I have something I needed to tell her as soon as her memory returned . I needed to tell her not to run . She does n’t have to anymore , ”
32645	32654	32637	32637	Kade	219	“ You helped her disappear the first time ? ”
32655	32658	32637	32637	Kade	219	“ Yes . ”
32659	32671	32672	32672	Kade	219	“ And you did n’t tell me she was n’t dead ? ”
32705	32708	32689	32689	Travis	219	“ Why ? ”
32709	32748	32749	32749	Travis	219	“ She was in trouble . Her life was in danger and so were yours and Max ’s . If keeping my mouth shut to keep everyone alive was what I had to do … I did it . ”
32768	32806	32749	32749	Travis	219	“ Do you think it was easy for me not to say anything , to watch everyone grieve ? Contrary to what you might think , brother … I do n’t enjoy seeing you or Max suffer . ”
32807	32823	32749	32749	Travis	219	“ You were n’t close to Max ; you did n’t see how much he — ”
32824	32830	32831	32831	Travis	219	“ Because I could n’t , ”
32868	32879	32861	32861	Kade	219	“ Tell me everything . And start at the beginning . ”
32880	32928	32929	32929	Travis	219	“ We do n’t have time for that right now . I ’ll tell you everything later . We need to find Mia . She has to be scared . She does n’t know the man who was threatening everyone ’s life is no longer a problem . ”
32955	32961	32962	32962	Kade	219	“ And why is that ? ”
32972	32977	32978	32978	Travis	219	“ He ’s dead , ”
32984	32988	32978	32978	Travis	219	“ Unfortunate accident . ”
32989	33004	33005	33005	Kade	219	“ You should have shared this with me . You ’re my goddamn brother , ”
33069	33098	33056	33056	Travis	219	“ Why ? What would you have done ? Gone to find her , thinking we could protect her ? Told Max so he could go find her ? ”
33099	33114	33056	33056	Travis	219	“ Probably . She did n’t need to do this . We have security — ”
33115	33126	33127	33127	Travis	219	“ Agents who failed to protect her from a madman , ”
33133	33218	33219	33219	Travis	219	“ Max was gone , you were gone … and I was left to make a decision . So I made it . So go ahead … beat the shit out of me for trying to protect our little sister , for never wanting to see her debased and abused again . Had you or Max gone after her , she would have never stayed hidden , never been safe . I ’ll live with your hatred if it means you ’re all alive , ”
33265	33295	33249	33249	Kade	219	“ I suppose I need to hear you out . I want to know what happened . You ’ll tell me about it on our way to find Mia , ”
33359	33377	33349	33349	Travis	219	“ I ’m pretty sure I know where she is . We ’ll have awhile to talk . ”
33398	33427	33428	33428	Kade	219	“ That ’s probably the most butt - ugly shirt I ’ve ever seen on you . Congratulations on topping the puke green one with the ugly frogs . ”
33431	33439	33440	33440	He	219	“ I knew you ’d like it . ”
33451	33460	33440	33440	He	219	“ Are you ever going to grow up ? ”
33471	33479	33465	33465	he	219	“ Not if I can help it . ”
33494	33516	33486	33486	he	219	“ You ’re changing your shirt , right ? I ’m not traveling with you if you ’re wearing that shirt . ”
33517	33537	33538	33538	Kade	219	“ Sure . I can change . We just have to stop by my house after we tell Max , ”
33545	33566	33567	33567	Travis	219	“ I can pick up some extra clothes if we ’re going to be gone overnight to go get Mia . ”
33571	33574	33575	33575	Kade	219	“ Good . ”
35064	35072	35073	35073	she	192	“ Now he ’ll really hate me , ”
35370	35373	35374	35374	she	192	“ No ! ”
35387	35412	35374	35374	she	192	“ You ca n’t talk to him ever again . You need to separate yourself from him completely . You ’re dangerous to him . ”
35930	35943	35921	35921	he	607	“ Open the door , Mia . I know you ’re there . ”
36099	36104	36094	36094	he	375	“ king of the world ”
36106	36112	36094	36094	he	375	“ emperor of the dumbasses . ”
36113	36121	36122	36122	Mia	192	“ Max … have you been drinking ? ”
36135	36142	36143	36143	Max	13	“ I ’ve had a few , ”
36297	36303	36304	36304	she	14	“ You never drink much , ”
36314	36322	36304	36304	she	14	“ And you never drink and drive . ”
36361	36391	36399	36399	he	13	“ Did n’t drive while I was drinking — except up your driveway , which , by the way , has a hell of a lot of damn potholes . ”
36432	36440	36441	36441	Mia	192	“ You ’re completely plastered , Max , ”
36455	36462	36445	36445	her	192	“ How much did you drink ? ”
36463	36468	36469	36469	he	13	“ Do n’t know , ”
36527	36536	36537	36537	she	192	“ How did you know I was here ? ”
36541	36557	36558	36558	he	13	“ Your brothers . I ’m not sure … but I think I killed Travis , ”
36590	36618	36619	36619	she	192	“ You did n’t kill my brother , and you should n’t have gotten in a fight with him . He ’s just trying to protect me , ”
36636	36652	36630	36630	she	192	“ Is that how you got that cut over your eye ? It ’s bleeding . ”
36679	36694	36673	36673	Max	13	“ Yeah ? If you think I look bad , you should see him , ”
36717	36724	36725	36725	he	13	“ He fights like a girl , ”
36762	36790	36791	36791	Mia	192	“ Bastard should have told me . You ’re my goddamn wife . I had a right to know that you ’d left me for another man . ”
36803	36817	36791	36791	Mia	192	“ Oh , Max . What did they say ? That is n’t — ”
36818	36839	36840	36840	Max	13	“ I want to hate you . I should hate you . But dammit , I just fucking ca n’t , ”
36898	36927	36928	36928	Max	13	“ Did you know that when I thought you were dead , I wanted to die too ? I did n’t want to go on living without you . ”
36949	36989	36942	36942	he	219	“ I was completely obsessed with you , so out of control that I had to back away from it to keep a leash on myself . And the whole fucking time , your mind was on another man . ”
37061	37073	37048	37048	He	219	“ I ’m not sure what my brothers said , but — ”
37074	37142	37143	37143	Max	13	“ They told me you left me because of another man . They told me that you ’d been hiding out in Montana at your grandmother ’s ranch . All this fucking time , you ’ve been alive and content in another state , happily living your life while I tormented myself with thoughts that you were dead , that I ’d never fucking see you again , ”
37177	37194	37195	37195	he	13	“ Why marry me ? It was n’t like you did n’t have your own money , ”
37215	37234	37195	37195	he	13	“ And where the hell is this other guy ? Did you run away from him , too ? ”
37258	37274	37235	37235	She	622	“ I married you because I loved you . I did n’t want anyone else . ”
37541	37544	37553	37553	he	13	“ Fuck . ”
37565	37583	37553	37553	he	13	“ What the hell am I doing ? I must have some kind of secret masochistic tendencies . ”
37630	37637	37638	37638	she	622	“ I think you need coffee , ”
37649	37654	37638	37638	she	622	“ I need you , ”
37833	37836	37837	37837	Mia	192	“ Max ? ”
37903	37924	37925	37925	she	192	“ Not enough to kill him , but he ’s going to have a pretty horrible hangover in the morning , ”
37954	37957	37958	37958	she	192	“ Tucker , ”
38042	38045	38046	38046	Mia	192	“ Come , ”
38094	38117	38118	38118	she	192	“ He ’s drunk . I did n’t do it . I was n’t there . Why did n’t you stop him ? ”
38309	38316	38317	38317	she	192	“ He hates me , Tucker , ”
38340	38349	38335	38335	he	13	“ And he thinks I had another man . ”
38473	38476	38477	38477	Max	13	“ Mia , ”
38502	38506	38507	38507	he	13	“ Come back , ”
38537	38540	38516	38516	Mia	192	“ Max ? ”
38583	38586	38587	38587	he	13	“ Mia , ”
38598	38608	38609	38609	she	192	“ Wake up , Max . You ’re dreaming , ”
38654	38659	38660	38660	he	13	“ You ’re here , ”
38672	38677	38678	38678	she	192	“ I ’m here , ”
38727	38733	38734	38734	he	13	“ Where are we going ? ”
38744	38752	38753	38753	she	192	“ I ’m putting you to bed , ”
38775	38780	38781	38781	he	13	“ No argument here , ”
38797	38808	38809	38809	Mia	192	“ You ’re wearing my ring . You found it . ”
38902	38910	38911	38911	she	192	“ I am . I love it , ”
39183	39189	39190	39190	he	13	“ Having problems , sweetheart ? ”
39205	39211	39202	39202	she	192	“ Take off your jeans . ”
39228	39239	39240	39240	he	13	“ I liked it better when you were doing it , ”
39321	39324	39325	39325	he	13	“ Off , ”
39337	39340	39341	39341	she	192	“ On , ”
39410	39415	39416	39416	he	13	“ I ’m lonely , ”
39444	39449	39450	39450	he	13	“ I love you , ”
39454	39465	39450	39450	he	13	“ Come here next to me . I miss you . ”
39708	39715	39716	39716	she	192	“ I love you , too , ”
39947	39958	39942	39942	she	192	“ Max ! Where in the hell is my sister ? ”
40063	40074	40056	40056	He	219	“ No screaming . My head is ready to explode . ”
40087	40092	40093	40093	Kade	219	“ Nobody was yelling , ”
40102	40112	40093	40093	Kade	219	“ Jesus Christ , you must have gotten pickled . ”
40113	40118	40119	40119	Travis	219	“ Coffee and aspirin , ”
40131	40148	40119	40119	Travis	219	“ You look like hell , buddy . What the hell happened ? Where is Mia ? ”
40207	40212	40213	40213	He	13	“ Is she gone ? ”
40355	40377	40378	40378	Kade	219	“ Well , she ’s not here . And a truck that I assume is hers is still in the driveway . ”
40385	40402	40378	40378	Kade	219	“ She had a rental car . She must have picked it up at the airport . ”
40420	40426	40427	40427	Kade	219	“ Then she ’s gone , ”
40431	40435	40427	40427	Kade	219	“ Damn it . ”
40436	40450	40451	40451	Max	13	“ I ’ll stay away from her . Maybe she ’ll stop running . ”
40482	40496	40497	40497	Kade	219	“ She is n’t running from you , man . She ’s scared , ”
40501	40505	40506	40506	Max	13	“ Of what ? ”
40528	40560	40561	40561	Kade	219	“ Long story that you need to hear . Take a shower , for God ’s sake . You smell like a damn distillery . Since when do you get drunk ? ”
40582	40595	40596	40596	Max	13	“ Since your sister decided to leave me again for another man , ”
40615	40624	40625	40625	Kade	219	“ We need to get one thing straight . ”
40630	40738	40625	40625	Kade	219	“ My sister loves you . I have no idea why . Personally , I think you ’re a real asshole to wake up to , but she ’s obviously blind to that . She did n’t leave you for another man . She left you because of one . There ’s a big difference . If you would have stayed to hear Travis out instead of trying to kill him , you ’d know the truth by now . Take a shower and meet us in the living room before you piss me off and I take a shot at the other side of your face . ”
40924	40927	40918	40918	Tucker	18	“ Traitor , ”
41001	41029	41030	41030	he	219	“ I do n’t know where she went . I did get drunk , and we … talked . She was here when I went to sleep , ”
41034	41075	41030	41030	he	219	“ I do n’t know why she left and I do n’t know where she went . She ran . Again . It ’s something Mia seems to excel at doing . I assume there was no note this time ? ”
41076	41085	41086	41086	Kade	219	“ Nothing . How much do you remember ? ”
41099	41104	41105	41105	Max	13	“ Not a lot , ”
41109	41146	41148	41148	he	219	“ I remember her being here when I went to sleep . I have a few empty spaces in my memory of last night . I ’m not sure what was real and what I imagined . ”
41161	41173	41174	41174	Kade	219	“ Welcome to ‘ the morning after , ’ Mr. Perfect , ”
41178	41215	41174	41174	Kade	219	“ I just wish I could have been here to see it . The ‘ always in control Max Hamilton ’ three sheets to the wind ? I would have paid good money for that show . ”
41216	41226	41227	41227	Max	13	“ No reruns . It was an exclusive showing , ”
41269	41275	41276	41276	His	219	“ Tell me about Mia . ”
41294	41299	41276	41276	His	219	“ Is she safe ? ”
41300	41352	41353	41353	Travis	219	“ I have a team of investigators tracking her as we speak . I should have a location on her shortly . She ’s obviously headed back to the airport . She hired the rental she got from there and there are n’t many other means of transport away from here . ”
41394	41482	41386	41386	his	219	“ To make a long story short , she got involved in a bad relationship back when she was in college . The asshole finally got put in jail and we thought it was over . He got out of prison right before Mia disappeared the first time , threatening to kill you , Kade , and me if she did n’t come back to him . She was afraid … and I helped her . She ’s my sister . Her safety was my main concern . ”
41483	41503	41504	41504	Max	13	“ She was my goddamn wife . Why did n’t you tell me ? I could have protected her , ”
41516	41558	41559	41559	Travis	219	“ You were unavailable . In fact , Danny had Mia in his grasp when your plane took off , your head in the sight of a rifle and ready to blow your head off . Your wife saved your life , ”
41563	41618	41559	41559	Travis	219	“ Danny Harvey was a career criminal , completely insane , and ready to do whatever it took to get Mia back . He was also a sharpshooter who could pick off a target at long distances . He won a lot of competitions when he was young . He rarely missed a target . ”
41619	41636	41637	41637	Max	13	“ Why was Mia even with him ? She could n’t have loved someone like that , ”
41644	41708	41641	41641	Kade	219	“ She was twenty - one years old , had an old man who was a raging alcoholic and completely insane . He beat his wife and children often and repeatedly . Mia suffered under my father ’s hand . We all did . Do you really think she even knew what love was ? Do you think she knew what normal was ? ”
41720	41778	41709	41709	Kade	219	“ I was gone , you were gone , and Travis was the only thing standing between her and him . I was pissed off , too , Max , when I found out he ’d been responsible for hiding her . But I might have done the same damn thing if it meant keeping Mia safe . ”
41779	41792	41793	41793	Max	13	“ You should have told me . I thought she was dead . ”
41806	41817	41799	41799	She	77	“ All those years , I fucking grieved for her . ”
41818	41878	41879	41879	Travis	219	“ It was n’t a picnic for her either . Do you think she wanted to go ? She was terrified he ’d kill you . She ran to keep you safe . She did n’t give a shit about what happened to her . I can testify to that because I saw the way he messed her up . ”
41885	41894	41879	41879	Travis	219	“ Back in college and before she disappeared . ”
41895	41904	41905	41905	Max	13	“ You knew when she was in college ? ”
41909	42021	41905	41905	Max	13	“ Not immediately . She went to Virginia to go to college . My father wanted her to go to business school in Florida and get involved in the business , but that was n’t what Mia wanted . Gran made jewelry when she was alive , and that ’s what Mia wanted to do . Mia had this house and her trust as an inheritance , but she did n’t have control of anything yet . She had to bury herself in student loans that she could pay back later to attend the college in Virginia that had the BFA and MFA that she wanted to become a jewelry designer . ”
42035	42083	42022	42022	Travis	219	“ Kade and I were both in school too , but once I finished my business degree and was working , I decided to go to Virginia to surprise Mia . I ended up more surprised than she was when I saw what was happening to her . ”
42097	42101	42084	42084	Travis	219	“ What happened ? ”
42122	42128	42116	42116	he	219	“ Did he hurt her ? ”
42129	42132	42133	42133	Travis	219	“ Yeah , ”
42136	42218	42133	42133	Travis	219	“ Pretty badly right about the time I went to visit . But even through all that bullshit , she was working part - time and pulling excellent grades . She was about ready to enter her master ’s program . And he was trying to convince her not to — with his fists . He did n’t want her accumulating more loans . The bastard wanted plenty of that trust fund left when she was able to get to it . ”
42219	42222	42223	42223	Max	13	“ Fuck ! ”
42242	42251	42237	42238	any man	667	“ How did she separate herself from him ? ”
42252	42289	42290	42290	Travis	219	“ She did n’t have to . He went to jail . I think she ’d been trying to get away from the relationship for a while , but he really did a number on her , ”
42316	42322	42323	42323	Max	13	“ What were the charges ? ”
42339	42349	42350	42350	Travis	219	“ Assault with a deadly weapon . Nasty ordeal , ”
42355	42361	42362	42362	Max	13	“ You set him up , ”
42379	42400	42367	42367	Travis	219	“ I went to have a discussion with him . Let ’s just say I made sure there were witnesses . ”
42401	42406	42407	42407	Max	13	“ Did Mia know ? ”
42426	42429	42430	42430	Travis	219	“ No , ”
42434	42471	42472	42472	Max	13	“ She had her studies and her job to worry about . All she ever knew was that he was going to jail , and she was safe . It was all she needed to know . ”
42506	42511	42512	42512	Max	13	“ And last time ? ”
42522	42629	42630	42630	Travis	219	“ He took her by surprise when she was leaving her car in a parking lot . She had dismissed your security , telling them she was going to be with Kade and me , and had our security . She told them to take some time off because she did n’t want them following her around town on errands . Danny had her in his vehicle before she even realized what happened . It was the morning you left , and he took her to an area near your jet , forced her to watch while he showed her how easily he could kill you , ”
42658	42886	42887	42887	Travis	219	“ She ’s a smart woman . She told him she would go with him , gave him everything he wanted to hear , but she said she needed a day to take care of some things first . She finally convinced him to let her go by herself by telling him she needed to arrange things to get to her trust fund . Somehow , she convinced him to meet her the next morning , making him think she wanted to go with him . I do n’t think she wanted to even tell me , but she asked for my help and I was n’t going to refuse her . We set up the stuff at the beach , hoping she would be assumed dead , and I got her away from Tampa as fast as I could . I wanted to tell you , Max . And I wanted Kade to know she was alive . I just was n’t entirely sure how either of you would react . I could n’t risk leaving any trail to Mia . This man was psychotic , probably more deranged than my father and a hundred times more dangerous . I wanted her safe and needed time to track his ass down . I never realized that it would take over two years to find the bastard , ”
42890	42896	42897	42897	Max	13	“ What about the police ? ”
42959	43049	42940	42940	Kade	219	“ Our father was a nut case . Do you have any idea how many times the police were at our house for a domestic dispute , usually reported by neighbors ? The Harrison family was notorious , and not in a good way . Do you really think they would have taken her seriously ? They would have done their job , but it would have alerted Danny , and it probably would n’t have stopped him . There is n’t a lot they can do with stalkers . ”
43050	43056	43057	43057	Max	13	“ But he hurt her , ”
43067	43105	43106	43106	Travis	219	“ No witnesses . No proof that he was to blame . They would n’t have had any evidence to immediately arrest him . Do you really think we could be totally certain that she was safe ? ”
43110	43164	43106	43106	Travis	219	“ I ’m sorry , Max . But I was n’t taking that chance with my baby sister or Kade . She needed to disappear for a while until I could track him down . Had I known the bastard was getting out of prison early , I would have had him tailed . ”
43165	43185	43252	43252	she	672	“ For over two fucking years ? You should have told me . She was my wife to protect . ”
43186	43197	43198	43198	Travis	219	“ She was my sister before she was your wife , ”
43203	43209	43210	43210	Max	13	“ I did n’t know , ”
43219	43241	43210	43210	Max	13	“ She never told me . I should have known she was in danger . I should have known about him . ”
43280	43288	43289	43289	Kade	219	“ You ’re not psychic , buddy , ”
43292	43331	43289	43289	Kade	219	“ She obviously did n’t want to talk about it . I never knew either . And he had been in jail for years . Nobody could predict what he was going to do when he got out . ”
43332	43379	43380	43380	Max	13	“ I was busy running away from how I felt about her , and she was trying to make herself into a perfect wife . It was n’t all her fault . I was n’t exactly accessible . I was n’t really ‘ seeing ’ her , ”
43469	43477	43478	43478	Kade	219	“ And if you had seen her ? ”
43485	43537	43482	43482	Max	13	“ I would have loved her the same way . But I might have been able to allow her to be who she was and not try to please me . Maybe I would have pulled my head out of my ass long enough to realize that she needed me too . ”
43584	43595	43596	43596	he	219	“ Damn secretary has been playing with my phone again , ”
43621	43627	43628	43628	Kade	219	“ Do n’t blame Travis , ”
43632	43686	43628	43628	Kade	219	“ Growing up with my father was n’t easy , and he was trying to protect Mia . We grew up trying to protect her from my father . Travis might have been a bit misguided , but Mia begged him not to tell anyone . She was afraid for all of us . ”
43687	43694	43695	43695	Max	13	“ I do n’t . Much , ”
43705	43729	43730	43730	he	13	“ I should have known more about her past , protected her myself . But that bastard is mine . He ’s dead , ”
43738	43744	43745	43745	Kade	219	“ He ’s already dead , ”
43749	43840	43745	43745	Kade	219	“ That ’s why we ’ve been trying to talk to Mia . When she lost her memory , obviously Travis could n’t say anything . But he needed her to know that Danny ’s dead . She ’s on the run because she does n’t know . She ’s still trying to protect us . I know she left that note and ran again to try to protect you . She loves you , Max . If you do n’t understand anything else , you have to know that . ”
43841	43851	43852	43852	Max	13	“ The guy is dead . Was it Travis ? ”
43885	43910	43911	43911	He	135	“ He wo n’t admit it . He says he finally tracked Danny down in Colorado and went to have a talk with him . ”
43921	44002	43918	43918	he	135	“ We know exactly what kind of ‘ talks ’ Travis would have when someone threatens his family . He says Danny fled before he could even get his hands on him . Travis got in his car and chased him down some winding mountain road and Danny made a fatal driving error . Danny ’s car went over the side of the mountain . Travis confirmed he was dead before he sent his guys to escort Mia back home . ”
44050	44055	44056	44056	Max	13	“ Travis outmaneuvered him , ”
44063	44067	44060	44060	Kade	219	“ You think ? ”
44068	44099	44100	44100	Kade	219	“ I ’m glad the bastard is dead . I just regret not having a chance at him myself . I ’d tear his fucking head off for hurting Mia . ”
44106	44143	44100	44100	Kade	219	“ You know , you get less and less like Mr. Perfect every day . You ’re starting to sound pretty brutal . What happened to the calm , smooth , and completely controlled Max Hamilton ? ”
44144	44160	44161	44161	Max	13	“ Never had any control when it comes to Mia . She makes me crazy , ”
44182	44197	44100	44100	Kade	219	“ Why did n’t Travis contact her once Danny was dead and tell her ? ”
44198	44307	44309	44309	Max	13	“ He had agents keeping an eye on her . He tried to call a few times after Danny died , but she did n’t answer . They had n’t had any contact since she left . He sent her money in a convoluted way so nobody could track it , money that she barely touched the whole time she was here . Travis did n’t want anyone to link the two of them together in any way . This house was left to Mia by Gran , along with her funds in trust , but I know I did n’t even think about it . Did you ? ”
44318	44392	44315	44315	Kade	219	“ Travis sent his guys in to pick Mia up when he could n’t reach her by phone and bring her home . He wanted to meet her at the jet to tell her , but he had some critical meeting that he could n’t get out of . When he got home , she was n’t there . She must have got to his place and left for the park almost immediately . ”
44393	44407	44408	44408	Max	13	“ Why was she there ? Did she know we ’d be there ? ”
44424	44459	44460	44460	Kade	219	“ I ’m not sure . My guess is she saw the invitation from Sam on Travis ’ cupboard . He said it was in the kitchen on the table when he got home . ”
44466	44509	44460	44460	Kade	219	“ It ’s the only thing that makes sense . Her shorter hair and the hair color were probably things she did before she left Montana . She did n’t know Danny was dead and probably wanted to keep a low profile . ”
44510	44516	44517	44517	Max	13	“ She came for me , ”
44534	44549	44517	44517	Max	13	“ She knew I would probably be there since Sam was hosting the picnic . ”
44550	44561	44562	44562	Kade	219	“ Nah … I think she was looking for me , ”
44579	44596	44572	44572	Max	13	“ Or maybe not , since she was staring at you with a nauseatingly lovesick look . ”
44597	44612	44613	44613	Max	13	“ She seemed … different after the accident . Still Mia , but more … ”
44626	44629	44613	44613	Max	13	“ whole . ”
44673	44720	44721	44721	Kade	219	“ I do n’t think it was the accident that changed her . She went through counseling while she was here in Montana . It was her deal with Travis . He made her promise she ’d find someone to talk to , try to heal , ”
44726	44778	44779	44779	Travis	219	“ I think maybe it helped . I did n’t get to see her often because I was on the road so much after I started college , but she seemed different to how she had been when she was younger . Like she was more comfortable in her own skin . ”
44794	44813	44779	44779	Travis	219	“ She ’s at the airport . She bought herself a one - way ticket to Los Angeles . ”
44814	44820	44821	44821	Max	13	“ What the hell for ? ”
44825	44838	44839	44839	Travis	219	“ She ’s on the run . It ’s a big city , ”
44842	44855	44839	44839	Travis	219	“ She ’s going to try to get lost in a crowd . ”
44856	44865	44870	44870	Mia	192	“ When ? Do you have the info ? ”
44877	44883	44870	44870	Mia	192	“ What time is it ? ”
44896	44904	44905	44905	Travis	219	“ I did n’t bring my cell . ”
44921	44933	44905	44905	Travis	219	“ It ’s nine . Her flight leaves at eleven thirty . ”
44941	44967	44968	44968	he	219	“ I ’ve got this . You two can go home . It ’s time for my wife and me to come to an understanding , ”
44972	44977	44978	44978	he	219	“ No more interference , ”
44999	45029	44989	44989	Travis	219	“ Agreed . Do n’t ever hurt her , and I wo n’t have to kill you . She ’s been through enough , Max . Make her happy . ”
45096	45104	45105	45105	Travis	219	“ Thanks for messing up my face . ”
45108	45111	45116	45116	he	219	“ Likewise . ”
45138	45147	45148	45148	Max	13	“ I ’ll change clothes in the car . ”
45202	45208	45209	45209	Kade	219	“ Need a clean shirt ? ”
45213	45218	45209	45209	Kade	219	“ I have extras . ”
45265	45280	45281	45281	he	219	“ Hell no . I do want her to actually come back to me , ”
45297	45305	45281	45281	he	219	“ Hey … Mia loves my shirts , ”
45684	45704	45672	45672	she	192	“ You have to the count of ten to get that beautiful ass up and out of this plane . ”
45741	45744	45745	45745	She	192	“ Max ? ”
45770	45788	45745	45745	She	192	“ You have to get off this plane . We ’re going to be taking off soon . ”
45789	45792	45794	45794	his	13	“ One . ”
45801	45812	45813	45813	Mia	192	“ Max . Stop this . You need to go . ”
45871	45874	45875	45875	He	13	“ Two . ”
45933	45957	45958	45958	Liar	65	“ I ’m leaving you , Max . I do n’t want to be with you anymore . I do n’t love you . ”
46022	46025	46009	46009	she	192	“ Three . ”
46115	46123	46101	46101	she	192	“ I ’m not going , Max . ”
46131	46134	46124	46124	She	192	“ Four . ”
46156	46169	46170	46170	Mia	192	“ Do n’t make this harder than it already is . Please . ”
46221	46224	46198	46198	she	192	“ Ten . ”
46265	46276	46249	46249	Mia	192	“ Let go . Dammit . What are you doing ? ”
46376	46384	46370	46370	she	192	“ What happened to counting to ten ? ”
46385	46395	46396	46396	he	13	“ Took too long . You talked too much , ”
46438	46448	46449	46449	she	192	“ I bet I would have gotten a ticket , ”
46522	46547	46548	46548	she	192	“ You do understand that you just kidnapped me . Last I knew , it ’s illegal to take a woman without her permission , ”
46556	46566	46567	46567	Max	13	“ How did you get through security , anyway ? ”
46570	46579	46567	46567	Max	13	“ I bought a ticket on the flight . ”
46622	46642	46605	46605	He	713	“ I do not want to go back to the ranch . I need to be on that plane . ”
46643	46649	46650	46650	Max	13	“ No you do n’t , ”
46656	46683	46684	46684	Danny	219	“ Danny ’s dead . And you ’re never running away from me again . I ’ll make sure to give you every reason to stay . ”
46721	46729	46709	46709	Mia	192	“ How do you know about him ? ”
46730	46733	46734	46734	Max	13	“ Travis , ”
46746	46757	46734	46734	Max	13	“ Why did n’t you ever tell me , Mia ? ”
46758	46795	46796	46796	she	192	“ I thought it was all over , and I wanted to leave it in the past . I did n’t think you ’d understand a woman being that stupid . What did Travis tell you ? ”
46832	46867	46868	46868	Max	13	“ He told me everything . Your relationship in college and the abuse , Danny nearly killing me , you saving my life . And you are not stupid . Did Travis miss anything ? ”
46882	46887	46888	46888	Mia	192	“ It ’s over , ”
47000	47019	47020	47020	Max	13	“ Your running days are over , sweetheart , but you and me … we’ll never be over , ”
47025	47044	47020	47020	Max	13	“ Not unless you ’ve really stopped loving me , and you really want it to be over . ”
47045	47063	47064	47064	Mia	192	“ But the woman you fell in love with does n’t exist . She never really did , ”
47069	47079	47064	47064	Mia	192	“ For me she did and she still does . ”
47106	47172	47173	47173	Max	13	“ I did n’t care about the superficial things . It did n’t matter what you wore , what you said to other people , or what was in your past . I fell in love with you , the you who was always there and still is , no matter how much you twisted yourself to fit an image I never really cared about . ”
47184	47257	47173	47173	Max	13	“ I want to know everything about you now . Maybe it was my fault because I put you on a pedestal instead of treating you like my woman . I thought you were perfect , but I would have felt that way regardless . Even if I ’d known about your past , your insecurities , your personal preferences , I still would have fucking worshipped the ground you walked on . ”
47258	47261	47262	47262	she	192	“ Why ? ”
47266	47315	47316	47316	Max	13	“ I was a screwed - up woman who put up with a highly abusive relationship for over a year . My self - confidence was nil , and I never felt like I was good enough for you , or enough of a woman to keep you . ”
47328	47356	47316	47316	Max	13	“ I ca n’t be the same man I was before either , Mia . The love was real , but we were both pretending , hiding . ”
47357	47361	47362	47362	she	192	“ What now ? ”
47389	47441	47442	47442	His	13	“ Now I plan to show my wife exactly how I feel about her , love her the way I ’ve always loved her but was too afraid to show it . We trust each other instead of running away . We strip each other bare in more ways than one . ”
47455	47473	47474	47474	she	192	“ I trust you . I always have . It was myself who I did n’t trust , ”
47524	47531	47532	47532	Max	13	“ Fuck . I need you , ”
47603	47606	47607	47607	he	13	“ Key , ”
47611	47627	47628	47628	she	192	“ In the plant . I can see it . Were Kade and Travis here ? ”
47632	47635	47628	47628	she	192	“ Yeah . ”
47636	47646	47647	47647	Max	13	“ They did n’t even bother to hide it . ”
47694	47729	47680	47680	he	13	“ I want you naked right now . I need you wanting me and moaning my name . I want to feel every emotion you have while I fuck you until you ’re satisfied . ”
47730	47735	47736	47736	she	192	“ B - Bedroom , ”
47771	47782	47783	47783	Max	13	“ I ’m not going to make it that far . ”
47820	47831	47832	47832	Mia	192	“ Mine . Every damn inch of you is mine . ”
48174	48181	48182	48182	he	13	“ Never run from me again , ”
48190	48195	48182	48182	he	13	“ We belong together . ”
48214	48224	48210	48210	she	192	“ Do it . I know you want to . ”
48241	48245	48246	48246	Max	13	“ Do it . ”
48307	48312	48313	48313	he	13	“ I ca n’t , ”
48325	48349	48350	48350	she	192	“ I know the difference between abuse and love play . For God ’s sake , do it . And make me come , ”
48360	48367	48368	48368	Max	13	“ I ’m not exactly playing , ”
48465	48474	48462	48462	she	192	“ Please , Max . Make me come . ”
48487	48500	48501	48501	Max	13	“ Never leave me again , Mia . Not for any reason , ”
48516	48520	48501	48501	Max	13	“ Promise me . ”
48536	48542	48543	48543	she	192	“ Touch me . Please , ”
48613	48617	48618	48618	he	13	“ Promise me , ”
48675	48685	48668	48668	her	192	“ Yes . I promise . I love you . ”
48686	48692	48693	48693	he	13	“ I love you too , ”
48753	48760	48761	48761	he	13	“ Come for me , sweetheart , ”
48764	48784	48761	48761	he	13	“ You ’re so hot , so wet . Let go . I ’ll catch you when you fall . ”
48939	48944	48945	48945	Max	13	“ What ’s this ? ”
49016	49019	49020	49020	she	192	“ You , ”
49024	49036	49020	49020	she	192	“ A red rose for true love , and your name . ”
49096	49100	49086	49086	her	192	“ Holy fuck ! ”
49191	49202	49203	49203	Max	13	“ You marked yourself for me , to be mine , ”
49206	49210	49211	49211	she	192	“ Had to , ”
49214	49220	49221	49221	She	192	“ Needed something . Anything . ”
49289	49315	49316	49316	He	13	“ That ’s the hottest thing I ’ve ever seen . My name branded on you forever . Does that make me a sick bastard ? ”
49330	49362	49316	49316	He	13	“ I want to stay just like this forever . My cock inside you , my body entwined with yours , surrounded by you . Nothing has ever felt this good . ”
49473	49479	49480	49480	he	13	“ I ca n’t wait , ”
49503	49510	49480	49480	he	13	“ I need to fuck you . ”
49607	49612	49613	49613	she	192	“ Then do it , ”
49618	49627	49613	49613	she	192	“ Please . I need it , too . ”
49723	49739	49710	49710	She	192	“ I love you , Mia . I love you so goddamn much it hurts , ”
49863	49866	49848	49848	She	192	“ Christ , ”
50121	50137	50115	50115	she	192	“ I guess we really should have talked before we did … um … that , ”
50150	50156	50157	50157	Max	13	“ We both have questions . ”
50161	50178	50179	50179	He	13	“ How we just communicated was incredible for me . I think talking is highly overrated . ”
50187	50199	50200	50200	Mia	192	“ I ca n’t believe you marked yourself with my name . ”
50211	50262	50263	50263	Max	13	“ I missed you so much that I had to do something or go crazy . I wanted something permanent to somehow keep you close to me . Maybe that sounds crazy , ’cause I never thought I ’d tattoo your name on my ass , but I wanted it . ”
50269	50332	50263	50263	Max	13	“ It looks good on you . I would have never asked you to do it because I know it hurts . But it ’s sexy as hell . I ’ll never look at it and not want to fuck you right that minute . So you better cover it up unless you want to be taken the second I see it . ”
50333	50350	50351	50351	she	738	“ Then I guess I ’m going to be walking away from you naked a lot , ”
50377	50383	50384	50384	he	13	“ Funny thing , though … ”
50398	50401	50402	50402	she	738	“ What ? ”
50428	50441	50418	50418	He	13	“ This . I got it a few months after you disappeared . ”
50609	50622	50591	50591	Max	13	“ But what if you had met someone else ? What if — ”
50641	50717	50718	50718	Mia	192	“ There is no one else for me , sweetheart . Even Kade did n’t protest when I did it . I guess he got the fact that I needed to do it . He took me to someone he knew who had done a few tattoos for him in the past . He said he already wore a tribute to you every day , but I do n’t know where he put the tat . ”
50723	50730	50731	50731	she	192	“ It ’s not a tattoo , ”
50740	50751	50736	50736	Max	13	“ Then how does he wear a tribute to you ? ”
50752	50762	50763	50763	she	192	“ His shirts . He wears those awful shirts , ”
50767	50869	50870	50870	Max	13	“ When I was a kid , he used to always wear black . I told him it was depressing and he should wear something happy . He started picking up outrageous shirts , ones that I ’m sure he probably got teased about at school . But he wore them because I liked them , and I told him they were happy shirts . When we grew up , he never stopped . So he does wear something for me . And he never quit wearing them , even when he grew up and I started teasing him about them . ”
50873	50884	50885	50885	Mia	192	“ I always thought he did that to irritate Travis . ”
50888	50951	50952	50952	She	192	“ That ’s only a side benefit and it might be the reason he does it now . But he started it because of me . I loved them when I was a kid . They were always happy shirts with the most outrageous characters or colors . Honestly , even though I joke around with him , I still love them . ”
50966	50991	50952	50952	She	192	“ Tell me why you used to run away . Was it really because of something I did ? The way I was acting ? ”
50992	50995	50996	50996	Max	13	“ No , ”
51007	51166	50996	50996	Max	13	“ From the time I understood what it meant to be adopted , I was grateful to my mother and father . I knew I ’d been thrown away by my real parents , and I was appreciative every day that I had parents who wanted me , who provided all of the things I needed and other things that I did n’t need . I was luckier than most of the kids at school , and it was n’t because I was born to them . They chose me . I guess I never wanted them to have a reason to regret it . So I became the perfect child . Or I tried to anyway . I did n’t want them to ever have a reason to regret adopting me . When I was really young , I think I was afraid they would give me back or reject me like my natural parents had done . ”
51202	51211	51212	51212	she	192	“ Did n’t you ever want to rebel ? ”
51230	51307	51227	51227	Max	13	“ Not really . Even after my parents died , I still wanted to please them . I graduated from college at the top of my class , did everything that was expected of me when I took over my father ’s business . I even thought of getting into politics because I knew it would make them proud . The only time I wanted to rebel from my normal behavior was when I met you . ”
51308	51316	51317	51317	she	742	“ So I was a bad influence ? ”
51324	51327	51328	51328	he	13	“ Never , ”
51349	51454	51455	51455	His	743	“ But it made me realize that I was n’t happy before I met you . I was living my life for two people I loved , but I was n’t them . I ’d tried to replicate their behavior because I thought being any other way would be a betrayal . I thought I needed to be like them because they were the parents who had wanted me . I was lifted out of a life of poverty because they adopted me . I wanted to be in the same class as my parents , even if I was n’t born into it . ”
51463	51478	51479	51479	Max	13	“ Just because you ’re different does n’t mean you are n’t still good . ”
51511	51521	51491	51491	she	744	“ I do n’t think they even expected that . ”
51522	51544	51545	51545	Max	13	“ I do n’t think they did either . They would have loved me regardless , because they were good parents , ”
51555	51562	51545	51545	Max	13	“ I expected it of myself . ”
51563	51579	51491	51491	she	744	“ And when you met me ? I know you had relationships before we met . ”
51580	51696	51697	51697	Max	13	“ Not like you and me . Before we met , I did the expected things . I dated . I fucked . But I did n’t feel the same way . You made me crazy from day one . It knocked me on my ass . I lost my control with you . I ’d conditioned myself for years to be a calm , controlled , reasonable businessman like my father , but you blew that persona all to hell , and I was worried about losing you if I was n’t the man you wanted . I knew about your parents , and I knew you needed stability , someone rational and sane , ”
51701	51706	51707	51707	Mia	192	“ Oh , Max , ”
51725	51745	51707	51707	Mia	192	“ I ’ve never met a saner man , and I kind of like the man you are now . ”
51768	51772	51756	51756	His	13	“ What changed ? ”
51773	51777	51778	51778	he	13	“ You died , ”
51785	51852	51853	51853	He	13	“ When I had to start admitting that I ’d probably never see you again , hold you again , talk to you again … I hated myself for never letting you know how much you meant to me , that you were my entire world . I fucking regretted every moment I had spent running away when I could have spent that time with you . ”
51861	51908	51853	51853	He	13	“ Now I hate myself for never seeing you , never noticing that you really needed me . I was a selfish prick . Had I stopped worrying about my image , I might have really known you — you might have told me about Danny . ”
51921	51967	51909	51909	He	13	“ Believe me , the last thing I wanted was for you to tie yourself in knots trying to please me . Hell , you please me just by breathing . You did n’t need to try to be anyone other than who you are . ”
51977	52033	52034	52034	God	20	“ I know that now . But those were my insecurities , baggage from my past . It was n’t you , Max . We ’re both responsible for not communicating . We were actually both hiding ; in love , but so afraid of losing that love instead of trusting ourselves and each other . ”
52072	52094	52062	52062	she	192	“ Growing up in my family was hell . My father ’s madness and abuse was hard on all of us . ”
52095	52104	52105	52105	Max	13	“ Your mother never thought about leaving him ? ”
52120	52168	52169	52169	Mia	192	“ No . Never . I think she ’d withstood his abuse for so long that she had closed down just to survive . We begged her to leave , even after we were grown , but she would n’t . She made excuses for his behavior , ”
52173	52201	52202	52202	Max	13	“ I think she loved us , but she could n’t stand up to my father . I ’m sure she lived in her own private hell . ”
52218	52228	52229	52229	Mia	192	“ You ’re cold . You have goose bumps . ”
52254	52259	52260	52260	she	192	“ Then warm me , ”
52268	52276	52260	52260	she	192	“ We are sitting here completely naked . ”
52318	52321	52322	52322	he	13	“ Better ? ”
52337	52340	52326	52326	Mia	192	“ Yes . ”
52360	52378	52326	52326	Mia	192	“ Are you ready to tell me about the asshole who made you run away from me ? ”
52394	52413	52385	52385	Max	13	“ Travis told me the facts . What I want to know is how you felt about him . ”
52431	52548	52427	52427	she	192	“ He did n’t start out the way he turned out to be . He was charming , paid attention to me . The controlling behavior started later , a few months after we started dating . The sad part was , it really was n’t all that surprising . It was what I grew up with . He was a lot like my father . I was n’t very strong , Max . I fell into the cycle of abuse . He would apologize and promise never to do it again . But he did . I wanted out , but I guess I was n’t strong enough to fight my way free of him . ”
52549	52552	52553	52553	Max	13	“ Friends ? ”
52557	52591	52592	52592	she	749	“ No . Looking back , he managed to slowly , methodically isolate me . I had made friends at school , but he did n’t let me hang out with them anymore , ”
52596	52633	52592	52592	she	749	“ I was so relieved when he went to prison . I thought it was over . I left Virginia after school and came back to Florida , hoping to start over again , be smarter . ”
52634	52661	52662	52662	Max	13	“ Sweetheart , you ’re brilliant and creative . You were shaped by your past and you were just a kid . Do n’t blame yourself , ”
52675	52730	52662	52662	Max	13	“ He came back after he was released from prison , threatened me and your brothers , was ready to blow my brains out ? How did you keep him from picking me off ? From what I understand , he could have easily made the shot and was crazy enough to do it . ”
52731	52739	52740	52740	Mia	192	“ He was much worse than before , ”
52743	52784	52740	52740	Mia	192	“ He blamed me for everything and was completely delusional . He thought I really wanted to be with him , and he was willing to do anything to get what he wanted . I knew he ’d do it . ”
52793	52807	52740	52740	Mia	192	“ I was unfaithful to you , Max . I ’m so sorry . ”
52992	53010	53011	53011	Max	13	“ The bastard raped you , did n’t he ? He should have gone back to jail . ”
53036	53047	53048	53048	Mia	192	“ Death is too good for a bastard like him . ”
53121	53187	53188	53188	she	192	“ He violated me . He did n’t rape me . He wanted me to suck him off ... and I did . You were almost on the plane . You just needed a few more minutes . I did n’t care , Max . I would have done anything he wanted right at the moment , as long as he did n’t hurt you , ”
53193	53212	53213	53213	Max	13	“ Fuck ! I would rather the bastard had killed me than to force you to do that … ”
53232	53245	53223	53223	his	13	“ The night you recovered your memory , in the shower … ? ”
53246	53284	53285	53285	she	192	“ I still have nightmares about him . I was dreaming about it , and I woke up with my memory returning . I wanted to replace the bad memories with good ones . And I did , ”
53288	53303	53285	53285	she	192	“ Shit . That had to be hard . You did n’t have to — ”
53304	53327	53328	53328	she	192	“ I wanted to . I wanted to so very badly . And it was hard . But it was n’t difficult , ”
53350	53370	53285	53285	she	192	“ I ’ve always wanted to , but you never seemed to want that , so I stopped trying . ”
53371	53405	53406	53406	Max	13	“ Oh , baby … I wanted it . I wanted your sweet mouth on me so badly that I knew if it happened , I would n’t be able to stay controlled , ”
53411	53416	53417	53417	she	192	“ It was good , ”
53425	53433	53417	53417	she	192	“ It will keep the nightmares away . ”
53434	53468	53469	53469	he	13	“ I ’ll keep the nightmares away . You ’ll never have bad dreams again . I ’ll replace every moment of sorrow you ’ve had with happiness . I swear I will , ”
53557	53569	53554	53554	she	192	“ Just love me like this forever . It ’s enough . ”
53570	53576	53577	53577	he	13	“ I ’ll never stop , ”
53588	53623	53624	53624	he	13	“ Just promise me you wo n’t ever try to protect me again . Not at your own expense . I would have rather died than to let him lay a finger on you , ”
53687	53721	53722	53722	He	754	“ I ’m not sure I can make that promise . It would n’t have saved me , Max . Danny still would have hurt me that day . But it saved you . ”
53728	53731	53732	53732	he	754	“ Promise , ”
53735	53738	53739	53739	she	192	“ No , ”
53742	53776	53739	53739	she	192	“ I ca n’t . Could you make the same promise ? You said no more lies , and I wo n’t lie to you . I ’d protect you if I could . ”
53777	53780	53781	53781	he	754	“ Fine , ”
53784	53811	53812	53812	She	192	“ I ’ll just make damn sure you ’re never in a position where you have to make that decision again . And no more running . ”
53817	53822	53823	53823	she	192	“ No more running , ”
53826	53839	53840	53840	he	754	“ If you need to run , I ’m going with you , ”
53844	53866	53840	53840	he	754	“ If you had told me you needed to disappear , I would have arranged it … for both of us . ”
53867	53875	53840	53840	he	754	“ But your career , your business — ”
53876	53927	53928	53928	His	754	“ Do n’t mean a damn thing without you . Do you think I ’d give a flying fuck about money or anything else if you were in danger ? I ’d disappear with you , be presumed dead along with you to protect you and your brothers without hesitation . ”
53955	53981	53982	53982	she	754	“ I ’ve been through over two years of counseling , and it ’s still hard to believe someone can love me like you do , ”
53985	54001	54002	54002	she	754	“ I ’ve come a long way , but I ’ll have my insecure moments , ”
54006	54028	54002	54002	she	754	“ I ’ll still find it hard to absorb that it ’s finally over . That we ’re all safe now . ”
54098	54114	54115	54115	he	13	“ Take all the time you need , baby . I ’ll convince you eventually , ”
54156	54164	54152	54152	she	754	“ You ’re amazing , Max Hamilton . ”
54165	54177	54178	54178	he	13	“ Did you think so when I was smacking your ass ? ”
54185	54199	54200	54200	she	754	“ Yes . It made me want to be naughty all over again , ”
54204	54225	54226	54226	he	13	“ Sweetheart , I want you to let me know if I ever scare you , or push your boundaries , ”
54231	54244	54226	54226	he	13	“ My control when it comes to you is n’t exactly reliable . ”
54245	54275	54276	54276	Mia	192	“ I ’m not afraid of you , Max . And I never could be . I know you ’d never hurt me . You make me feel safe . ”
54367	54386	54387	54387	he	13	“ You ’re safe now , and I ’m going to make damn sure you stay that way , ”
54410	54416	54390	54390	They	758	“ Did Travis kill Danny ? ”
54425	54449	54422	54422	he	13	“ Probably . It was technically an accident , but Travis was there . Is the fact that he ’s dead bothering you ? ”
54450	54531	54390	54390	They	758	“ No . It does n’t bother me personally that Danny is dead . He deserved it , my family is safe , and it means he wo n’t be around to terrorize anyone else . But poor Travis already put Danny in jail . I hate that he might have had to kill someone for me to be free . He does have a conscience , but he ’s always done whatever it took to protect me and Kade . ”
54532	54545	54546	54546	Max	13	“ You know he was the one who put Danny in jail ? ”
54551	54599	54600	54600	she	759	“ Of course I knew . Does he really think I ’m that stupid ? He shows up in Virginia , sees what ’s happening , and Danny is suddenly going to prison ? I knew Travis had done it . What actually happened to kill Danny ? ”
54604	54719	54720	54720	Max	13	“ When Travis finally located Danny , he went to talk to him . Danny fled in a vehicle and Travis took off after him . Danny ended up going down a very high ravine in Colorado after he lost control during the chase . And believe me , I doubt that Travis felt a twinge of remorse after what the bastard had done to you . When he had verification that Danny was dead , he arranged to bring you home , but apparently never got a chance to talk to you about it because you were gone when he got home from his meeting . Why were you at the picnic anyway ? ”
54725	54734	54720	54720	Max	13	“ You had just gotten back to Florida . ”
54735	54794	54720	54720	Max	13	“ I knew you ’d probably be there . I saw the invitation at Travis ’ house . I knew you ’d probably hate me for what I ’d done , but I wanted to see you . I could n’t help myself . I kept moving closer , but I did n’t think you ’d recognize me . ”
54795	54806	54807	54807	Max	13	“ No chance of that . I could sense you , ”
54812	54833	54807	54807	Max	13	“ But the disguise was good enough that no one else did . Did you cut your hair that day ? ”
54834	54876	54877	54877	she	760	“ No . I had it done about a year ago . My long hair was used as a weapon too many times . I did it to feel better . It was kind of like therapy . It felt good , ”
54881	54890	54891	54891	Max	13	“ He pulled you around by your hair ? ”
54920	54923	54916	54916	She	192	“ Yes . ”
54940	54943	54944	54944	Max	13	“ Tired ? ”
54947	54980	54981	54981	she	192	“ Very . I did n’t sleep last night . I wanted to savor the feeling of being together one last time , even though you were three sheets to the wind , ”
54984	55008	54981	54981	she	192	“ I can only imagine the whopper of a hangover you must have had this morning . Do you even remember last night ? ”
55009	55013	55014	55014	Max	13	“ Not much , ”
55018	55044	55045	55045	she	192	“ Do you want me to fill you in how you accused me of being with another man and how you wanted to hate me ? ”
55051	55083	55045	55045	she	192	“ And why did you bring Tucker ? I ’m assuming my brothers left and took Tucker with them , but I thought you and my dog barely tolerated each other . ”
55109	55157	55101	55101	he	13	“ I did think you had a boyfriend . I did n’t exactly get the whole story before I laid into your brother . All I heard was that he ’d been responsible for taking you away from me . We did n’t talk much after that . ”
55187	55233	55181	55181	his	13	“ And the only thing I have in common with that ugly canine is the fact that we both love you . I could n’t leave him at the house alone . I was being humane . He ’s still a pain in my ass . ”
55234	55247	55248	55248	Mia	192	“ Do you talk to him ? Tucker ’s a good listener , ”
55252	55264	55265	55265	Max	13	“ He ’s judgmental . I hate that in a dog , ”
55303	55308	55309	55309	Mia	192	“ You adore him , ”
55312	55328	55329	55329	Max	13	“ He irritates the hell out of me . Blames me because you went away , ”
55332	55344	55345	55345	she	192	“ You could have dropped him at the neighbor ’s house , ”
55349	55354	55345	55345	she	192	“ They love Tucker . ”
55355	55361	55362	55362	Max	13	“ He wanted to come , ”
55366	55375	55362	55362	Max	13	“ He was whining . He missed you . ”
55403	55411	55400	55400	she	192	“ Did you make peace with Travis ? ”
55429	55441	55442	55442	Max	13	“ Yeah . We ’ve agreed not to kill each other , ”
55448	55452	55442	55442	Max	13	“ And Kade ? ”
55453	55464	55465	55465	he	13	“ I still owe him for laughing at my hangover , ”
55472	55477	55469	55469	Mia	192	“ Was it bad ? ”
55478	55504	55505	55505	he	13	“ Bad enough to make me want to be a teetotaler . I ’m not sure I can ever drink another drop of alcohol again , ”
55509	55529	55530	55530	he	13	“ Now I know why I ’ve never gotten drunk . I had some sense before I met you , ”
55533	55561	55562	55562	Mia	192	“ The thought of you betraying me and happily living your life somewhere else made me crazy . I remember how I felt before I got drunk . ”
55565	55581	55562	55562	Mia	192	“ I ca n’t believe you ’ve never been drunk . Not even in college ? ”
55582	55593	55604	55604	Mia	192	“ Nope . I studied while everyone else was partying . ”
55594	55603	55604	55604	Mia	192	“ Oh God . You really are perfect , ”
55610	55631	55632	55632	she	192	“ And there could never be anyone else , Max . I even had your name tattooed on my ass , ”
55643	55655	55637	55637	Max	13	“ Yeah . You did . And it ’s fucking beautiful . ”
55659	55675	55637	55637	Max	13	“ I forgot that you curse now , so I guess you are n’t perfect . ”
55676	55701	55702	55702	he	983	“ I always cursed . I just never did it in front of you . My dad never swore in front of my mother , ”
55706	55714	55715	55715	Mia	192	“ Feel free to let it fly , ”
55721	55756	55715	55715	Mia	192	“ I have two brothers . I ’ve heard every profanity in existence and like to use a few occasionally . But since you never swore , I tried not to let one slip . ”
55757	55805	55806	55806	Max	13	“ Christ , we really were pathetic . I ’ve always adored you , but I ’m not sure we ever really knew each other . No , I take that back . My heart knew you , but the rest of me was a damn idiot , ”
55810	55845	55846	55846	Mia	192	“ I ’m sorry I was n’t there for you when you needed me . You should n’t have needed to run to Travis . You should have been able to come to me . ”
55857	55902	55903	55903	Max	13	“ I did n’t allow it . And I was n’t there for you either , Max . But I think we ’ve both changed . Can we just start over again ? I ’d like to be a real wife to you now . ”
55914	55935	55903	55903	Max	13	“ Did you really think there was ever any question about it ? You ’re not going anywhere , sweetheart . ”
55990	56000	55969	55969	She	192	“ You belong to me too , you know . ”
56001	56014	56015	56015	he	13	“ Baby , I ’ve known that from the moment we met , ”
56034	56038	56039	56039	she	192	“ Me too , ”
56322	56327	56316	56316	She	77	“ work in progress , ”
56840	56861	56862	56862	She	192	“ I hope you do n’t mind . I used your music app . I left my phone in Florida . ”
56903	56915	56916	56916	he	13	“ You ’re my everything . What ’s mine is yours , ”
56927	56942	56943	56943	she	192	“ So you do n’t mind if I use your shaver on my legs ? ”
56947	56954	56955	56955	he	13	“ Okay , anything except that , ”
56968	56990	56960	56960	He	13	“ Oh hell , you can use that too . If the blade gets blunt , I ’ll get another one . ”
57019	57033	57016	57016	she	192	“ I would n’t dare . I know where men draw the line . ”
57034	57042	57043	57043	Max	13	“ There are no lines with us , ”
57047	57064	57043	57043	Max	13	“ Cross the line any time you want to with me . Invade my personal space . ”
57181	57189	57190	57190	Mia	192	“ I thought we were going riding , ”
57290	57302	57303	57303	Max	13	“ Maybe we need to take a different type of ride , ”
57318	57334	57335	57335	she	192	“ I ’m glad you said that , because I was thinking the same thing , ”
57384	57387	57388	57388	He	13	“ ride . ”
57413	57423	57424	57424	she	192	“ Happy birthday , Happy anniversary , merry Christmas , ”
57489	57495	57496	57496	Mia	192	“ Whose car is this ? ”
57508	57536	57496	57496	Mia	192	“ It ’s yours now . I wanted to get you something for all the holidays we ’ve missed together . And I know you want it . ”
57555	57565	57566	57566	Simon	23	“ How did you know I wanted a Ferrari ? ”
57627	57674	57613	57613	Mia	192	“ I was already arranging it before I had to leave the second time . I went to use your laptop a few times , and the screen was up for this car . Obviously you wanted it . Why did n’t you just buy it ? ”
57692	57716	57717	57717	He	13	“ Because it ’s not sensible . Why do I need another car , especially one that costs over a quarter million dollars ? ”
57738	57764	57765	57765	she	797	“ Max … you can afford it . You can have things you want . You do n’t have to always do the sensible thing , ”
57770	57793	57794	57794	His	13	“ Sometimes it ’s fun to do something just because you want to and not try to apply any reason to it . ”
57832	57846	57847	57847	he	13	“ You did this for me ? How did you get it here ? ”
57853	57873	57874	57874	she	797	“ With my brother ’s help . Kade arranged to get it sent here . Do you like it ? ”
57878	57888	57889	57889	He	13	“ I paid for it from my own funds . ”
57979	57995	57996	57996	He	13	“ Hell yeah . I love it . I ’ve been wanting a Ferrari forever . ”
58044	58059	58033	58033	he	13	“ You ’ll rent a sports car , but you wo n’t own one ? ”
58076	58085	58060	58060	Max	13	“ I had to scratch the itch occasionally . ”
58100	58107	58097	58097	she	797	“ It ’s permanently cured now . ”
58130	58136	58137	58137	he	13	“ I have another itch , ”
58153	58179	58137	58137	he	13	“ I ca n’t believe you did this for me . How is it that you seem to know what I want before I do ? ”
58180	58183	58184	58184	she	797	“ Observation , ”
58191	58235	58236	58236	Max	13	“ I spied this time . And you knew you wanted it ; you just would n’t admit it to yourself . You ’ve spent a lot of senseless money on me in the past , but you make different rules for yourself . ”
58265	58275	58277	58277	he	13	“ I actually got something for you , too . ”
58283	58293	58277	58277	he	13	“ And spending money on you is never senseless . ”
58294	58297	58298	58298	she	797	“ What ? ”
58342	58349	58325	58325	Max	13	“ I got it in Florida . ”
58370	58389	58365	58365	he	13	“ I did n’t know if we ’d find your wedding ring again . So I got this . ”
58423	58428	58429	58429	Mia	192	“ Oh , Max . ”
58442	58454	58429	58429	Mia	192	“ It ’s incredible . But I have my wedding ring . ”
58455	58461	58462	58462	Max	13	“ You have another finger , ”
58470	58485	58462	58462	Max	13	“ One ring for our first marriage , and another for our second chance . ”
58508	58512	58513	58513	he	13	“ Keep me , ”
58546	58567	58568	58568	Max	13	“ This is exquisite . It must have cost you a fortune . The sapphire is at least seventeen carats . ”
58599	58620	58589	58589	she	192	“ Cost is n’t exactly a problem . I wanted more diamonds , but Gabrielle said it would be overkill . ”
58621	58656	58657	58657	Max	13	“ Gabrielle . Oh , God . I knew this looked like her work . But she ’s booked forever for custom stuff . How did you get her to do this so quickly ? ”
58733	58739	58740	58740	he	13	“ Do you like it ? ”
58769	58795	58759	58759	Mia	192	“ There is n’t a woman in the world who would n’t . Thank you , Max . I love it . I love you . ”
58796	58801	58802	58802	He	13	“ Do n’t cry . ”
58811	58820	58802	58802	He	13	“ It was supposed to make you smile . ”
58821	58852	58759	58759	Mia	192	“ I am happy . It ’s just such an incredible piece of jewelry . You did n’t need to do this . I already have a gorgeous wedding ring . ”
58853	58864	58865	58865	he	13	“ You did n’t have to buy me a Ferrari , ”
58869	58874	58875	58875	she	192	“ I wanted to , ”
58878	58881	58882	58882	he	13	“ Ditto , ”
58889	58899	58900	58900	she	192	“ Are you planning on giving me a ride ? ”
59022	59031	59032	59032	Max	13	“ Do we know where we ’re going ? ”
59056	59061	59062	59062	Mia	192	“ Does it matter ? ”
59227	59237	59218	59218	his	13	“ Nope . It does n’t matter at all . ”
59238	59253	59254	59254	Mia	192	“ You look like a teenage boy who just got his driver ’s license , ”
59259	59285	59286	59286	he	13	“ I ’ve had a license for a long time , woman . But I do feel like a teenager in a couple of ways , ”
59301	59304	59296	59296	he	13	“ How ? ”
59305	59352	59353	59353	he	13	“ I want to see if this vehicle really does go from zero to sixty in less than four seconds and you make me as horny as a teenage kid who wants nothing more than to get into the panties of the girl sitting beside him , ”
59361	59369	59370	59370	Mia	192	“ I ’m pretty easy for you , ”
59378	59384	59385	59385	She	192	“ I ’m your wife . ”
59392	59406	59385	59385	She	192	“ Turn right . It ’s a long stretch of pretty straight road . ”
59637	59646	59647	59647	Max	13	“ Zero to sixty in under four seconds , ”
59672	59691	59692	59692	Mia	192	“ Well , let ’s see it , Grandpa . Tear it up . Just watch for deer , ”
59754	59761	59762	59762	Max	13	“ Damn , it really does , ”
59894	59903	59904	59904	she	192	“ Turn up here . The next right , ”
60010	60026	60027	60027	Mia	192	“ This is one of my favorite spots . I want you to see it , ”
60143	60149	60150	60150	Mia	192	“ I love it here , ”
60154	60166	60150	60150	Mia	192	“ I used to come here when I was really lonely . ”
60178	60184	60185	60185	he	13	“ How often was that ? ”
60215	60219	60220	60220	she	192	“ Every day , ”
60239	60252	60220	60220	she	192	“ There was n’t a day that I did n’t miss you . ”
60400	60426	60392	60392	he	13	“ I love you . I missed you so much I did n’t feel like I was alive anymore . I need you , Mia . ”
60477	60483	60484	60484	she	192	“ Your kisses are dangerous , ”
60677	60680	60681	60681	Max	13	“ Mia ! ”
60761	60769	60772	60772	Max	13	“ Fuck . I ’m coming down , ”
60784	60793	60778	60778	she	192	“ No , Max . Go for help . ”
60849	60863	60834	60834	she	192	“ You ca n’t climb down . You ’ll go down . Please . ”
60887	60891	60892	60892	Max	13	“ Like hell , ”
60904	60913	60892	60892	Max	13	“ You ca n’t hang on that long . ”
60951	60959	60961	60961	him	13	“ Max ! Damn it . Stop . ”
60986	61010	61011	61011	he	13	“ You ’re not fucking dying here , sweetheart . Not today . Not on any day . I just got you back , ”
61042	61052	61036	61036	she	192	“ This is crazy . We ’ll both die . ”
61053	61060	61061	61061	Max	13	“ Nobody . Is . Dying , ”
61149	61154	61139	61139	she	192	“ Max . Please . ”
61211	61217	61218	61218	she	192	“ Stubborn , pigheaded man , ”
61222	61232	61218	61218	she	192	“ You ’re supposed to be the cautious one . ”
61233	61241	61242	61242	Max	13	“ Not when it comes to you , ”
61246	61254	61242	61242	Max	13	“ You ’re going up , sweetheart . ”
61255	61262	61263	61263	He	13	“ Max . You ca n’t — ”
61285	61290	61291	61291	he	13	“ Climb , dammit , ”
61471	61481	61482	61482	Max	13	“ Get your ass back over that edge now , ”
61509	61516	61496	61496	Mia	192	“ You can grab my hand . ”
61517	61524	61525	61525	Max	13	“ Just . Move . Back . ”
61679	61684	61685	61685	he	13	“ Are you okay ? ”
61727	61746	61720	61720	he	13	“ I ’m fine . I was just afraid you ’d kill yourself . What were you thinking ? ”
61763	61802	61720	61720	he	13	“ That was a stupid , risky thing to do . Do n’t you ever do that again , Maxwell Hamilton . You took at least twenty years off my life and scared the shit out of me . ”
61907	61926	61888	61888	she	192	“ What would I do if something happened to you , Max ? I could n’t stand it . ”
61927	61949	61950	61950	Max	13	“ I know . That ’s how I felt for over two years when I thought you were dead , baby , ”
62032	62049	62024	62024	she	192	“ I could n’t have borne it . I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry . ”
62068	62148	62024	62024	she	192	“ I do n’t care about the past anymore , Mia . I care about us now . If I have you now , nothing else matters . I get that you were trying to protect me . I get that you did n’t know what else to do . I contributed to the whole mess with my own fucked - up way of handling everything . Let it go . Right now I need to be inside you , ”
62165	62174	62149	62149	Max	13	“ We ’re alive , we ’re together . ”
62175	62188	62189	62189	she	192	“ I ca n’t believe you came down that cliff after me , ”
62196	62211	62212	62212	Max	13	“ It does n’t matter where you are — I’ll always come after you , ”
62318	62322	62323	62323	Max	13	“ Be still , ”
62472	62480	62481	62481	he	150	“ I need you to need me , ”
62525	62537	62507	62507	Mia	192	“ I already do . Fuck me , Max . Please . ”
62538	62554	62555	62555	he	150	“ Do you know how I felt when you went over that cliff , sweetheart ? ”
62577	62580	62581	62581	Mia	192	“ Yes , ”
62585	62598	62581	62581	Mia	192	“ The same way I felt when I saw you hanging there . ”
62599	62610	62611	62611	Max	13	“ I felt like you were dying all over again . ”
62625	62634	62635	62635	His	13	“ And I died for a moment too . ”
62685	62690	62691	62691	she	192	“ I need you , ”
62706	62721	62722	62722	he	13	“ You ’re wet for me , sweetheart . But I want you needier , ”
62741	62769	62722	62722	he	13	“ I want you to come for me . Because I know that once I ’m inside you , I wo n’t last . Not this time . ”
62814	62830	62831	62831	she	192	“ Then make me come . Because I have to have you inside me now , ”
62945	62954	62955	62955	he	13	“ Put your arms and legs around me , ”
62976	62991	62966	62966	he	13	“ Nothing between us this time . You feel incredible . So damn good . ”
63075	63078	63079	63079	she	192	“ Yes , ”
63170	63175	63167	63167	she	192	“ I love you . ”
63337	63352	63325	63325	Mia	192	“ You scared the hell out of me . Do n’t do it again . ”
63371	63394	63395	63395	he	13	“ Sweetheart , if it sends you into that kind of passionate rage , I think I ’ll do it every day , ”
63402	63408	63409	63409	she	192	“ I ’ll divorce you , ”
63413	63419	63420	63420	he	13	“ No you wo n’t , ”
