2470	2501	2452	2453	the man	67	“ They ’re my security too , Sunshine . They work for Hudson . Do you think they would do anything other than let me by them with a polite good evening?”Arrogant
2635	2662	2615	2615	she	855	“ What do you want , Sam ? This is hardly your neighborhood . And I do n’t think you need the services of a hooker ? ”
2718	2737	2714	2714	he	785	“ Would you care , Sunshine ? Would it matter to you if I fucked every woman in the city?”“Ha
2755	2819	2714	2714	he	785	” She answered sarcastically , but her heart was racing and her breath caught as he moved close enough for her to catch a whiff of his enticing smell of musk and man , a spicy aroma that made her slightly dizzy . His scent had n’t changed , and it was still as tempting as it had been all those years ago . “Why
2855	2860	2714	2714	he	785	” he growled softly . “Simon
2864	2927	2929	2930	some thug	125	” Somehow , she could n’t associate the two men , even if they were brothers . Simon was nice and had a heart of gold underneath his gruff exterior . Sam was the devil himself , Satan disguised as GQ model with more money and power than any man had the right to have . Especially a man like Samuel Hudson . “What
2942	3045	2929	2930	some thug	125	” He moved closer , so close she could feel his warm breath caressing her temple . God , he was so tall , so broad and muscular . Sam had worked construction when she had known him years ago , hard physical labor that had given him a sculpted , perfect body . Strangely , it had n’t changed one single bit . How in the hell did a man maintain that awesome body sitting behind a desk ? Backing away from his intimidating presence , her ass bumped against the desk , leaving her no space to move further away . “A
3059	3092	3051	3057	a woman alone in an empty office	127	” he continued , his voice low , dangerous . Maddie pushed against Sam ’s chest , trying to get free of her wedged - in position between him and the desk . “
3112	3129	3130	3130	I	10	”His muscular thigh moved over hers , annihilating the possibility of being kneed in the groin . “
3148	3242	3247	3247	Hudson	785	”She craned her neck and looked at him , his emerald green eyes watching her carefully . Just as it had years ago , his handsome face took her breath away . He ’d always reminded her of some ancient blond god , so damn perfect that his body and features should be carved in marble . However , at the moment , he might be as hard as marble , but he was far from cold . Heat emanated from his body in waves , his eyes just as fiery and molten . “
3249	3285	3247	3247	Hudson	785	”Sam ’s lips turned up , twitching precariously like he was trying not to grin . His hands splayed over her back , pulling her body completely into his as he whispered into her ear , “
3319	3343	3298	3298	You	129	”Liar . He ’s such a damn liar . If I had been so desirable he would n’t have done what he did . “
3355	3392	3393	3393	me	10	” The bastard was playing her , and it was intolerable . She was n’t beautiful and she was nothing like the twiggy blonde models that he sported on his arm and took to his bed . “Kiss
3409	3429	3393	3393	me	10	” Sam answered , his dark green eyes lit with sparks of fire , his voice hard and demanding . “The
3460	3740	3742	3742	Maddie	855	”Maddie never got a chance to finish . Sam ’s hot , hard mouth smothered her bitter words , never asking , simply demanding her response . His large , agile hands moved down her back , grasping her ass and lifting her to a sitting position on the desk , making it easier for him to devour her mouth . Sam never just kissed , he branded , he claimed . Maddie moaned into his mouth as his tongue thrust and retreated , thrust and retreated , until she was breathless . Surrendering , her arms wound around his neck , her hands fisting his silken wavy locks of hair , savoring the fall of softness over her fingertips . Wrapping her legs around his hips , needing to somehow find an anchor to keep her from drifting away in a tidal wave of lust , she allowed her tongue to duel with his , feeling his arousal against her heated core . Her hips surged against his erection with every hard thrust of his tongue . Sam groaned , his hands delving under her sweatshirt , his fingertips stroking over the bare skin of her back , making her shiver with longing . Maddie was drowning , lost in a sea of desire and need , slowly being pulled under the surface by a force stronger than her will . I have to stop . This has to end before I ’m completely lost . Yanking her head back , her mouth disconnected from Sam ’s , leaving her panting for oxygen and completely shaken . Sam pulled her head forward to rest against his heaving chest . “Shit
3746	3805	3744	3744	Maddie	855	” he choked out , one hand spearing into her curls , stroking her hair reverently . Oh , God . No . She could n’t be sucked in by Sam Hudson again . Not in any way . She shoved hard against his chest , twisting away and lowering her legs until her feet hit the floor . “
3810	3952	3744	3744	Maddie	855	”Fury built to a raging inferno inside her . How dare he use her , play with her because he was bored and she was the only available female in the building ? Sam Hudson was playboy , a man who took women to his bed and discarded them , finding another plaything soon after he was done with the last one . He was rarely seen with the same woman more than once . Did the man have a conscience ? Did he care about no one but himself?Maddie wanted to curl up into a little ball to protect herself , shamed by the way she had responded to Sam even though he was a complete dog . What kind of a person did that make her?She shrugged away from him , turning her back to sprint for the door . “Maddie
3956	4001	3744	3744	Maddie	855	” Sam ’s voice was husky , pleading yet demanding . He grasped her arm , swinging her to face him before she was able to get to the door . Maddie turned to face him , her fury and fear battling for dominance . “
4058	4063	4064	4064	Sam	785	”“You still want me , ”
4091	4119	4120	4120	she	99	“ No , I do n’t . My body might respond to a gorgeous man , but it ’s just physiological , a sexual reaction . You , ”
4132	4140	4128	4128	she	99	“ mean absolutely nothing to me anymore . ”“You
4159	4192	4157	4157	Kitten	16	” he told her arrogantly , a satisfied smirk on his face . She shrugged , trying to force down her violent desire to slap the conceited look from his handsome face . “
4209	4476	4478	4478	you	136	”Wrenching her arm from his hold , Maddie stormed through the office door , scooping her jacket from the hook by the reception desk and bolting through the lobby and out the front door of the clinic . She did n’t look back . She could n’t . One of Hudson ’s security officers escorted her to her car and she drove away as if she were a convicted criminal with the law on her tail , wanting nothing more than to get as far away from Sam as she could possibly get . Maddie drove in a daze , two words playing through her hazy brain like a broken record . Never again . Never again.*****Sam Hudson walked slowly through the reception area of the clinic , lost in his own thoughts . What the hell had just happened ? He ’d stopped to see if Maddie was okay , concerned that she was still at the clinic so late - a quick stop to make sure all was well because he knew she was here alone . Damn . Could he ever see the woman and not want to possess her , make her want him as much as he wanted her?You’ve never gotten over her . You probably never will . She ’s haunted you for years . She got under your skin like a sliver of wood that ’s always a little bit raw and irritated , never working its way out again . Stepping outside , Sam closed the door behind him . He glanced at one of his security officers . “
4480	4484	4486	4486	sir	136	up?”The man nodded . “
4497	4507	4492	4493	Dr. Reynolds	855	”Sam barked a humorless , self - mocking laugh . “
4515	4592	4492	4493	Dr. Reynolds	855	” I learned that she still fucking hates me as much as she ever did . He lifted a hand to the other guards as he departed , making his way to his vehicle . Yep . That meeting had gone really well , he thought darkly as stepped into his Bugatti and started the engine . You never even said you were sorry . Her words haunted him , would probably always haunt him now . “
4595	5134	4492	4493	Dr. Reynolds	855	” Sam slammed his fist against the steering wheel in frustration . Nope . He had n’t ever said he was sorry . Then again , he had n’t been able to say it back then . Still , he should have said it , found a way to apologize later . It had n’t been possible after the incident had taken place , and he had just blown his second chance a few minutes ago . What was it about Maddie that made him lose his reason?You’re acting like an asshole because she does n’t really care about you anymore and it ’s eating you alive . You might be able to have her body if you seduce her … but never her heart . Never again . Once , years ago , Maddie had looked at him with eyes that sparkled with admiration , adoration . One brief incident , and he had washed that look from her beautiful eyes forever . Leaning his forehead against the steering wheel , he closed his eyes , still able to picture the Maddie who had looked at him with respect and affection even when he had n’t had two pennies to rub together . It was ironic , now that he was one of the wealthiest men in the world , she eyed him like a bug that needed to be squashed , a rodent that needed to be exterminated . You’ll see her again . She ’ll be forced to talk to you for Simon and Kara ’s wedding . The wedding was being held in his home , so Maddie would n’t have a choice . He was the best man and she was the maid of honor . Maddie would have to at least be civil , and Sam knew she would . She was considerate and loyal to anyone she considered a friend . Her own feelings would take a back seat to making sure Kara had a happy wedding , one with no hassles or ugliness . And no matter how Maddie treats me , no matter how she looks at me , I wo n’t be a dick to her . Shit . I hope she does n’t bring a guy with her . I never asked Simon if she was involved with anyone . Sam sat back in his seat with a heavy sigh and put his car in gear , wondering if it was even possible anymore for him not to be an asshole . Truth was , the years had changed him , made him into a man who he was n’t at all certain he liked anymore . And if Maddie had a man in her life , he was even more likely to lose it . Find a woman , someone to take your mind off Maddie . Snapping his seatbelt on as he backed out of the parking space , Sam took a deep breath and ran through a mental list of possible willing females … until he caught a tantalizing smell , an elusive scent that clung tenaciously to his sweater . Her fragrance . A reminder of what had just occurred in her office . “Fuck
5153	5593	5142	5142	I	10	” he whispered to himself , pissed off that he had kissed her , that he had felt her lush curves against his body . Now , the thought of spending the night in the bed of any other woman but Maddie left him cold . Honestly , it had left him cold since the moment he had seen Madeline again over a year ago . Sam braked his vehicle at the exit of the parking lot , glancing quickly at his watch , grinning as he turned left instead of right , headed toward Simon ’s condo . It was time . Simon had called him earlier , informing Sam that he was going to be an uncle , and asking for a favor , which was a complete rarity for Simon . There was nothing Sam would n’t do for his little brother . He had failed to protect Simon once , and it was n’t happening ever again . Whatever Simon needed , he ’d be there for him . Thank God Simon had found Kara . Sam adored his brother ’s fiancée , wanting to kiss the ground she walked on , simply because she loved his little brother unconditionally , made Simon happier than Sam had ever seen him . And Simon deserved that happiness , that kind of devotion from a woman . Unfortunately , watching Simon and Kara together made Sam realize just how empty his own life was , how desolate and superficial his existence had become . Like I have n’t always known that ? Nothing has been real since I lost Maddie . Kissing Maddie , holding her again after all those years , had made things even worse . It was like something was awakening deep inside of him , a sensation that was familiar , yet not . Certainly , it was n’t comfortable . Forget her . Forget what it felt like to lose yourself in Maddie ’s softness , her scent , the feel of her lush curves and deliciously eager mouth . Sam cursed , knowing he ’d be sleeping alone tonight , taking himself in hand as he fantasized about Maddie . And this time , those memories would be much more vivid , newer , more real than ever before . Fuck ! He was so completely screwed … and definitely not in a good way.*****Maddie turned the page of the book on her lap , wondering why she just did n’t give up and go to bed . It was n’t like she was really absorbing any of the written words . “Damn
5596	5764	5142	5142	I	10	” she whispered , slamming the book closed and dropping it on the table beside the sofa . Honestly , she did n’t want to go to bed . If she did , she would just keep remembering her encounter with Sam , torturing herself with memories of that scorching hot kiss earlier in the evening . Swiping the remote control from the table , she pushed the button to activate the television , hoping she could drown out her thoughts with the ten o’clock news . Her doorbell rang just as the news anchor starting recounting the top stories of the day . Who the hell could it be ? She had no family and none of her friends would come to her door at this time of night unless it was an emergency . She sprang to her feet and sprinted to the door , her heart racing . Looking through the peephole , she saw a man in uniform , a Hudson security uniform . “Who
5773	5781	5782	5782	Valentine	18	” she called loudly through the door . “Special
5790	5796	5787	5788	Dr. Reynolds	855	” The man called back . “Leave
5801	5820	5823	5823	ma’am	855	” There was no way she opening her door , even if the guy was apparently from Hudson . “I
5835	7040	5825	5825	I	10	” He bent , then straightened again and left . Maddie opened the door a crack , leaving the security chain in place . She watched the man get into his truck and drive away . She lifted the chain and opened the door completely , her eyes widening . On her doorstep was the most incredible bouquet of red roses she had ever seen . There were several dozen flowers , too many for her to count in her stunned condition . Lifting the heavy , sturdy vase that appeared to be made of crystal , she secured the door behind her and lugged the roses to her dining room table . Placing them in the middle of the circular oak surface , she plucked the card from the center of the arrangement . She sat , her shaky knees barely able to support her legs . The card was small , the outside of the tiny envelope decorated with hearts and a cute little Cupid in the corner . The only thing on the front was her name . She opened it with trembling fingers , yanking the notecard from its surrounding paper . There , in handwriting she still recognized , were only two words . I’m sorry . There was no signature , no other identifying markings . Dropping both the envelope and card on the table , Maddie buried her face in her hands and wept . Chapter 2 Enough ! This is complete bullshit . Sam Hudson shoved his cell phone into the pocket of his gray Armani suit and hit the brakes of his Bugatti , jamming the pedal so hard that the tires squealed in protest , before shifting gears and doing a completely illegal U - turn in the middle of a Tampa side street . Gritting his teeth , he hit the gas and flew in the opposite direction , away from his waterfront mansion home . What in hell is she doing ? Trying to kill herself?Honestly , Dr. Maddie Reynolds was about to kill him . She was in her Tampa free clinic again . After dark . In a crappy area of Tampa . She ’d been there every evening now for two weeks , his security alerting him every time she was there at night . For fourteen goddamn days he ’d waited at home to hear from his security that she had safely left the area for the night . Every night it was after eleven . Tonight was day fifteen and it was midnight . And Maddie still had n’t left the clinic . She was seeing patients , on a volunteer basis , every night at the clinic after she finished in her regular job as a hospitalist . Obviously , she stayed later doing the necessary paperwork and case evaluations after she closed the clinic around nine o’clock , sometimes ten . When she had blocks of days off , she spent them there in the clinic . All day . And half the damn night . There was no way she could keep up this kind of schedule and not drop from exhaustion . Slamming his palm against the steering wheel in frustration , Sam was determined to find out what the hell was going on . Maddie had always worked like a fiend , doing tons of hours for no pay at her free clinic on her off days , but not like this , not every single night . She had security from Hudson there because his brother Simon had arranged it after his fiancée , Kara , had nearly been shot during a robbery at the facility , but it still was n’t safe , and Maddie ’s hours were ridiculous . Did she ever sleep ? Did she eat?Sam had n’t seen Maddie since his encounter with her at the clinic nearly a month ago , a brief interlude that he was having a difficult time forgetting . All he had to do was think about that kiss , or smell her scent on the sweater he had been wearing that night , a garment that , for some strange reason , he had n’t yet thrown into his pile for dry cleaning , and his cock was hard enough to pound nails . Shit . She ’s making me insane . Scowling , he cut a hard right turn and accelerated , his heart thumping at the thought of seeing Maddie again , wondering what she had made of the flowers he had sent her on Valentine ’s Day . Once , years ago , he only been able to afford to give her a single red rose . Now , he had finally given her the dozens of roses she deserved . Yeah , it was a shitty way to apologize for what had happened all those years ago , but he ’d never been especially good with apologies . He was Sam Hudson , billionaire and co - owner of the Hudson Corporation . Hell , he had n’t apologized for anything since … well … ever , except for his drunken actions at Simon ’s birthday party the year before . Okay , he had probably apologized years ago , but not since his mother had grabbed his ear when he was a kid and made him answerable for his bad behavior . He ’d made a habit of not doing anything he might end up regretting ; excluding that incident with Maddie so many years ago and the more recent incident with Kara . Even now , he could n’t actually be completely regretful for what he had done to Maddie , except for the part where he had hurt her with his actions . Really , his only apology in years had been the one to Kara and his brother for his behavior at Simon ’s birthday party . He had been drunk , depressed . But it still did n’t excuse his shitty behavior . Luckily , Simon and Kara had forgiven him , leaving the incident in the past . I hurt Maddie , the one person who I never wanted to hurt . But he had , and for that , he was sorry . She’ll never forgive me . Sam ’s jaw clenched as he turned left , getting closer to the clinic , into a seedier area of the city . Yeah , he knew that Maddie was lost to him , had known it since the moment he had alienated her forever . Pain still ripped through his chest when he thought about the shattered look on Maddie ’s face , the devastation in her beautiful , hazel eyes . That was the day he had lost his Sunshine , and even after his years of success , the money , the power , his life was still fucking overcast , and sometimes downright gloomy . I can still be her friend even though she hates me . I owe that to her as a friend . She ’s killing herself with work and I have to stop her . “Shit
7042	7169	5825	5825	I	10	” Sam cursed in a low , fervent voice . Who was he trying to fool ? He was n’t an altruistic type of guy . Truth was , he wanted to see her , wanted to protect her . The rehearsal dinner for Simon and Kara ’s wedding was tomorrow and Maddie would be there , but he could n’t take another night of worrying about her . He was ending this now , before the crazy female made herself sick from pulling too many hours without enough sleep . He did n’t bother to pull into the parking lot . He steered his expensive sports car up to the curb and exited , waving to the two Hudson guards in front of the clinic . “She
7173	7185	7187	7187	sir	136	” he asked one of the guards closest to the door . “Yes
7194	7466	7187	7187	sir	136	” The older man quickly brought forward a key to unlock the door . She will . Right fucking now . Sam pushed open the door , his irritation making his stomach churn . As he strode through the lobby , he heard the loud click of the door being locked behind him . Ignoring it , he strode through the reception area and into the back offices . He stopped , taking a deep breath before he opened the door of Maddie ’s office , preparing himself for an ugly confrontation . His pent - up breath exited his body in an audible whoosh as he realized there would be no warfare in the immediate future . His intended opponent , dressed in an old pair of green scrubs , her fiery curls spread out over the desk and her right arm bent and supporting her head … was fast asleep . Making his way to her desk , he scowled as he noticed the dark circles under her eyes . Still , the woman looked like an angel , her unblemished skin a creamy ivory , her mouth the color of ripe strawberries . Scanning her face , he realized she was n’t even wearing make - up , probably having showered after her clinic hours . He brought his hand gently to the back of her head , her damp hair confirming his suspicions about the shower . Giving in to the urges he was trying to hold in check , he buried his hand in her abundant curls , letting her fiery hair spill over his fingers . “Shit
7468	7500	7501	7501	Maddie	855	” he muttered softly , fingering the tresses gently , indulging himself as her light floral scent wafted over his senses . He crouched , bringing his face level with hers . “
7503	7545	7501	7501	Maddie	855	” he called gently , his hand still caressing her hair . She lifted her left hand , which had been resting on her thigh , and swatted at him , missing as he lurched backward to avoid the feeble swing . “
7559	7590	7595	7595	Sunshine	14	” she mumbled , her lips turning down into a frown , as though irritated . Sam ’s lips curled up in an amused smile as he rubbed her scalp . “
7597	7617	7595	7595	Sunshine	14	”Maddie slapped at him again , this time hitting his shoulder in a pathetic , half - hearted smack . “
7623	7786	7791	7791	Maddie	855	” she muttered , her eyes remaining closed . Christ . She ’s really out of it . Placing his hand against her mug of coffee , he noticed it was barely warm . She had n’t been out for long , but obviously she was exhausted , so sleep deprived that her cognitive function was incredibly slow . Sam slid her weekly planner out from under her arm , glancing quickly at the open page . Hmmm . She was off work for the next five days . Not that he was really surprised . All of the functions for Simon and Kara ’s wedding were starting tomorrow , beginning with the rehearsal and the rehearsal dinner . Snapping the planner closed , he slid it into the pocket of his suit and rolled her chair back , her delectable ass still planted in it , just enough to slide one arm under her knees and the other behind her back . “
7793	7801	7791	7791	Maddie	855	” he whispered in a husky voice . “Tired
7803	7809	7791	7791	Maddie	855	” she said , irritated . “
7813	7868	7791	7791	Maddie	855	”Sam glanced at Maddie ’s face as he stood with the petite bundle of femininity in his arms . She had n’t even opened her eyes . But she was still feisty . Head resting against his shoulder , she stirred , her arms creeping around his neck instinctively to make herself more comfortable . “
7879	8104	7874	7874	I	10	” she protested , her words slurred as if drunk . Maddie ’s comment was so ridiculous that Sam grinned at her , raking his eyes over her body as he shifted her weight against his chest . She had a body made for sin , a body that had always been the most unholy temptation he had ever seen . Sam liked a woman with curves , and Maddie had them in abundance . Her breasts would fill a man ’s hands , and her skin was like silk . That ample , curvaceous ass was firm , and he got hot just fantasizing about those shapely thighs wrapped around his waist , Maddie urging him to fuck her . Just the feel of her softness against him made his cock strain against the zipper of his pants , eager to bury itself inside her , lose himself in that petite , curvy body . Maddie never did like her body even though she ’s my ideal . He chuckled as he snagged her purse from the back of the office chair , placing it on her abdomen as he strolled out of the office and to the lobby . Stopping at the locked door , he waited for security to open the outer door , putting his mouth to Maddie ’s ear . “
8115	8139	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” he told her in a low , graveled voice , knowing she was n’t coherent , but needing to tell her regardless . “Too
8142	8150	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” she answered on a soft sigh . “Perfect
8152	8158	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” he answered , amused . “Ugly
8162	8171	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” she whispered , her eyes still closed . “Beautiful
8173	8177	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” he retorted . “You’re
8180	8190	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” she said with a feminine grunt of irritation . “Probably
8192	9276	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” he admitted , exiting through the door as his employee opened it and stopping at the passenger side of his Bugatti . The guard caught Sam ’s subtle message and rushed to open the door of the automobile . Maddie let loose another soft sigh , her warm breath caressing his neck . Sam bit back a groan . Breathing a sigh of relief , Sam deposited Maddie ’s cuddly body into the seat . He could n’t be that close to her . Her scent , the feel of her body made him fucking insane . He fastened her seatbelt and settled her handbag into her lap before closing the door . Taking a deep breath , he moved around the car , lifting his hand in a silent gesture of thanks to his helpful security employee as he opened the driver ’s door and settled himself into his seat . Closing the door , he started the engine and strapped on his own seatbelt , his gaze drifting back to Maddie . Shit ! He hated seeing Maddie this way , so obviously exhausted . Even if it rankled , he ’d rather see her spitting fire at him , her eyes flashing , her voice dripping with sarcasm or anger . Seeing her look so tired , so lost , so vulnerable ripped his fucking heart from his chest . Tearing his eyes away from her , he shifted his Veyron into gear , making a decision that was definitely going to piss her off , but deciding he did n’t give a shit . No doubt , if he did n’t intervene , she ’d be right back in action in the morning , hauling her drained body out of bed and into the clinic before the rehearsal and dinner the following afternoon . Not happening ! So what if she hates me for it ? She already knows that I ’m an asshole . Does n’t matter . As long as she ’s healthy . He plugged his cell phone into its dashboard holder , intending to make some calls as he swung the car into a U - turn and headed back in the same direction he had been driving earlier . He grinned , shooting a quick glance at Maddie before he dialed the first number , barking orders into the phone even though it was after one o’clock in the morning . Luckily , his personal assistant was sharp , and responded immediately . It was n’t every night that Sam called him at this hour ; in fact , Sam never had called his PA at this hour , and David caught on instantly that the orders were important to his boss . Totally oblivious , Maddie slumbered on , oblivious to the fact that she was about to take a short vacation , whether she wanted it or not.*****Sam deposited Maddie onto his ridiculously high thread count Egyptian cotton sheets and watched as she snuggled into the soft fabric , tugging the pillow under her head with a satisfied moan - a throaty , erotic sound that nearly had him panting . There ’s never been a day when I have n’t panted after her , not since the first time I laid eyes on her . Yeah , he ’d wanted her then too . His eyes had zoomed in on that bright , fiery mane of hers , pulled back from her face and cascading down her back , his cock jerking as his eyes landed on her beautiful face with those oh - so - conservative glasses perched on her nose , a slight frown of confusion on her cherry - red lips . She ’d looked like a damn naughty librarian , and he ’d gotten instantly hard every time he ’d seen her from that day forward . Wonder what happened to her glasses?Gently , Sam lifted one of her eyelids to make sure she was n’t wearing contacts that need to be removed , chuckling as she grunted with displeasure at the invasion . Satisfied that she must have had her vision corrected with laser surgery , he pulled his hand away from her face and sighed . Damn … he used to love to pull those glasses from her face and kiss her breathless . A small part of him mourned the loss , but a larger portion was relieved that she could see and that she had been able to get rid of the hated glasses . He pulled off her tennis shoes and let them drop to the floor , deciding she could sleep in her scrubs . They were obviously clean and probably comfortable . He stripped , watching her sleep while he discarded his clothing , disrobing until he stood only in his boxer briefs . Walking around the bed , he slipped between the sheets on the other side , flipping off the light beside his bed , his body tense . It was a big bed , but it was n’t big enough . Was he completely insane ? How the fuck was he supposed to sleep with Maddie in his bed ? This moment was surreal , an event he had dreamed about forever and fantasized about often . Go to sleep , asshole . You ’re watching over her . If you do n’t stay with her she ’ll probably sneak out before you can catch her . Oh , hell no . There was no way she was working tomorrow . That bullshit needed to stop . Punching his pillow , he rolled to his side , facing Maddie . God , she was beautiful . Everything about her was absolutely perfect . Unable to stop himself , he reached out his hand , scooting closer to her , as though drawn by a magnet . He fingered her curls , and then ran the back of his hand down her delicate face . The room was lit only by moonlight , but it was bright enough to see her features . As he ran his hand down her arm , she stirred , her eyelids fluttering . Her body moving restlessly , she inched toward him until she was rubbing against him , her body plastered against his entire front . Her arms circled his neck , nestling against his body like she belonged there . “She
9279	9284	8113	8113	Sunshine	14	” he whispered fiercely . “
9302	9304	9305	9305	she	143	”“Sam ? ”
9319	9320	9316	9316	he	143	“ Yeah?”“I
9329	9352	9357	9357	Sunshine	14	” She snuggled against him , belying her words as she clung to his fiery body like a heat - seeking missile . “I
9362	9680	9681	9681	Hudson	785	” he answered gravely . He wrapped his arms around her . She might hate him , but she needed him right now . And he was determined to be there for her . Like I should have been all along . I did n’t fucking know she had never gotten married . Unless she got married and did n’t change her name ; but what sort of guy would let his woman work the way she does ? I thought she ’d have half a dozen kids by now . Sam figured she must at least have a man in her life and he shuddered at the thought . Mine . She fucking belongs here with me . Closing his eyes , he let his senses absorb her fragrance , the feel of her body pressed against him . It was agony and ecstasy all at once . He lay there , listening to Maddie ’s steady , even breathing , indicating that she ’d finally settled and was deeply asleep . Strangely enough , Sam followed her into slumber moments later , his body relaxing , and his mind , for the first in years , completely content . Chapter 3 Maddie woke the next morning confused , her head pounding like she had the mother of all hangovers- except for the fact that she rarely drank more than a glass of wine . What in the hell happened ? Where am I?Pushing the hair back from her face , she blinked as she opened her eyes , her whole head foggy . Hearing a masculine groan beneath her , she pushed to sit up , her fingers greeted by hot skin and tight muscle as she pushed against an enormous male chest . What the hell?!Maddie ’s eyes grew wide , coming totally awake in seconds as she looked at the body beneath hers . “
9683	9707	9681	9681	Hudson	785	” she hissed , noticing that she was straddling him , torso to torso , her head having previously rested on his shoulder . “
9715	9744	9747	9747	Sam	785	”His eyes were wide open , shooting her a hot , intense look that nearly incinerated her . Her heart thundered as his sizzling green eyes devoured her . “You
9753	9764	9751	9751	Sunshine	14	” he told her in a low , sultry voice . “
9798	9879	9791	9791	I	10	”Maddie shivered as he cupped her ass in his hands , bringing her core flush with his raging erection . Last night ? Last night ? What exactly had happened ? Thinking furiously , she tried to remember if she and Sam had been … intimate . The last thing she remembered was putting her head on her desk at the clinic , just thinking she needed to rest her burning eyes for a moment . And then … nothing . “
9889	9903	9904	9904	we	146	” She stopped abruptly , unable to ask Sam Hudson that mortifying question . “Did
9907	9923	9904	9904	we	146	” he asked her casually . He released a beleaguered masculine sigh as he continued , “
9942	10064	9936	9936	you	147	”Thank God!Swinging her leg over his body , she scrambled away from him , moving to the other side of the bed . Swiping the irritating curls from her face , she gave him an annoyed glance . She was still dressed in the clean scrubs she had donned after her shower at the clinic . He , however , was naked ; at least from the waist up . She tried not to notice that sculpted chest , covered in a light dusting of blond hair , and the enticing trail that went down his navel to his … Shit!Pulling her eyes away from him , completely disgusted with herself for drooling over his ripped body , she asked abruptly , “
10073	10170	9936	9936	you	147	” She assumed that this was his home , since she was in the same bed as him . A bed , that she had to admit , had damn nice sheets , in a bedroom with lovely furnishings . Sam sat up , and Maddie held her breath as the sheet slipped lower , her eyes drawn unerringly back to his abdomen . Then , she noticed the elastic band that sat low on his hips , proof that he was n’t completely naked . She released her breath , hating herself for being disappointed . “I’d
10200	10214	10189	10189	you	67	” he replied , his hot green eyes raking her face and body . “
10261	10269	10249	10249	I	10	”Sliding from the bed , she asked , “
10279	10312	10272	10272	I	10	” She put her hands on her hips , annoyed that he had invaded her clinic . Again . Flipping back the covers , he stood , shooting her a dangerous look . “
10362	10594	10601	10601	your	155	” he growled , walking across the room to retrieve a gray silk robe from a chair . She opened her mouth to give him a scathing reply , but closed it as she watched him swagger across the room . Holy glutes , the man had an ass so tight that she could see every movement , every muscle contract and release as he strode across the room . Now that was the kind of ass a woman wanted to grope . Sam was ripped everywhere . He was damn near perfect , so incredibly masculine that he took her breath away . He still had the light scars on his back , strips of lighter skin that she had asked him about years ago but had never gotten a clear answer as to how he had gotten them . Shrugging into the robe , he turned , giving her a quick glimpse of his morning erection that was prominently outlined by the snug undergarments . Catching her eyes with his , he smirked and raised a naughty brow . Don’t look at him . This is Sam Hudson . Asshole extraordinaire . He might look incredible , but his heart is as black as coal . Jerking her eyes away from that teasing emerald glance , she tried to remember what she wanted to say . Oh , yeah . “
10615	10618	10604	10604	You	155	”He snorted . “
10640	10644	10645	10645	You	155	”Oh , shit . “
10647	10655	10645	10645	You	155	me?”He held his hand up in warning , “
10666	10675	10661	10661	Your	155	” His face was fierce as he continued . “
10705	10714	10715	10715	she	155	”“I have to . Those people need me , ”
10718	10729	10715	10715	she	155	“ They do n’t have anyone else to go to . ”Maddie
10790	10813	10786	10786	he	785	“ You ca n’t save the world , Maddie . You ’re only one person . It wo n’t bring Crystal back . ”Maddie
10908	10973	10895	10895	She	9	“ Do n’t you think I know that ? I had a five - year - old kid who I almost did n’t diagnose in time . He was chronically sick , tired , fatigued . It took a while to do the testing because I ’m not at the clinic every day . He had type 1 diabetes . He could have died . ”
10999	11012	10991	10991	she	9	“ I have to spend as much time there as I can . ”
11087	11120	11072	11072	he	12	“ He did n’t die , because you were there . But you are n’t helping the working poor by exhausting yourself . There ’s a limit to what you can do . ”“I
11121	11141	11142	11142	he	12	need-”“You need rest . You need to be able to fully function to give the best care you can , ”
11147	11188	11189	11189	He	12	“ I know you , Maddie . You were a crusader even when we were younger . You ca n’t save the world . You have to help one person at a time and hope you can make a difference . ”
11208	11245	11203	11203	he	12	“ I always knew you ’d be a phenomenal doctor , but it will eat your soul if you let it . You take the responsibility of the world on your shoulders . You always have . ”Maddie
11280	11289	11290	11290	she	9	“ I do n’t know what to do , ”
11332	11339	11340	11340	Sam	785	“I have a proposition for you , ”
11353	11355	11340	11340	Sam	785	“What ? ”
11368	11380	11381	11381	he	785	“We can talk about it at breakfast . I ’m starving , ”
11385	11415	11381	11381	he	785	“No . I need to shower and get to the clinic . Shit ! I do n’t have any clothes here . I ’ll have to wear the same scrubs and-”“You’ll
11437	11453	11425	11425	I	10	” He moved back and motioned toward a door on the other side of bedroom . “
11467	11480	11481	11481	she	166	”“I told you I have to go . I have appointments today , ”
11493	11499	11500	11500	he	10	“Actually , you do n’t , ”
11510	11520	11521	11521	she	166	“I have a full schedule until the wedding rehearsal , ”
11542	11566	11567	11567	He	10	appointments?“You do n’t . Your clinic is being covered by another doctor for a while . With the help of a few nurses . ”
11582	11588	11591	11591	she	855	“What ? How ? Why ? ”
11622	11633	11614	11614	his	10	“ It was done on my orders , my arrangement . ”“You
11651	11659	11642	11642	Hudson	785	” she snapped at him , furious . “Somebody
11680	12607	12617	12617	your	171	” He turned and left , pulling the bedroom door closed behind him . Maddie was fuming as she entered the bathroom , tempted to chase Sam ’s ass down and tell him off . But she needed to prepare herself . He had her so angry right now that she would n’t be at all effective at shooting him down in her current mood . Who the hell was running her clinic ? Were they taking good care of the people there ? Dammit!She stripped out of her scrubs and underwear , folding them together in a bundle to take with her when she left , which she planned on doing immediately after she dealt with Sam Hudson . It took her a moment to figure out how to use the fancy shower he had , one which had several showerheads that pulsated hot water over every muscle in her body , a decadent pleasure that made her bite back a moan as she washed her hair and scrubbed her body . Not at all surprised that he had female shower gel and shampoo in his shower , Maddie tried not to think about the gazillion women who had probably done more than just showered with Sam in this room , in this enclosure . Turning the shower off , she reached for a fluffy towel , patting her body dry and applying some lotion from the array of feminine toiletries aligning the cupboards . Clothing was piled on every surface , women ’s clothing . And every item still had the tags on them . Come to think of it , everything she had opened was brand new , including the shampoo and conditioner she ’d used . Checking the size on a pair of jeans , she noticed that they were her size , as were all the clothes , every item a petite length . Even the new undergarments were her size - except none of the stuff was exactly her style . The underwear was decadent , wisps of silk and lace . The jeans were hip huggers ; slimmer cut than she usually wore , cupping her curves and ass tightly when she slipped them on . Ignoring the image in the glass mirrors , she pulled a shirt over her head . It was a tee , but it was short and fit snugly over her breasts . Oh , to hell with it . I ’m changing at the clinic anyway . She tamed her wild hair with a never - used hairbrush that she had to pull from the package . No hair clips . Scrounging through all the new lotions , gels , hairspray and other assorted items , she found absolutely nothing to secure her riot of curls . With all of the attention Sam had paid to detail , Maddie knew it was intentional . He had never liked her hair pulled back . Opening one of the medicine cabinets , she smiled evilly , yanking out a package of condoms . Extra - Large . Maddie would like to think that Sam having these was a case of wishful thinking , but she knew it was n’t . She ’d felt that erection against her enough times to know he was built big . Pulling one from the wrapping , she ripped off the top ring and trashed the rest of it in the garbage . Perfect . The band was stretchy enough to hold back her mass of curls in a ponytail at her neck . Now all she needed was coffee and she ’d feel human again . Grabbing her shoes from the side of the bed , she trotted down the stairs , having no idea where the kitchen was located . When she got to the bottom of the steps , she looked around , admiring the high cathedral ceiling and the light décor ; the color scheme seemed to make everything seem lighter , more airy and cheerful . She already knew Sam ’s home was massive , big enough to host a wedding and reception . Looking to the left , she saw a huge living room . On the right she saw a massive entryway . Deducing that the kitchen was more likely to be to the right , Maddie wandered that direction , eager to find a coffee maker . She needed her caffeine fix , and she needed it bad . Her headache had dulled to a slight annoyance , but her addiction to caffeine was n’t helping . Ignoring several smaller hallways , she followed what looked like a major corridor that might lead to the kitchen . Yes ! Finally!There was a large arched doorway that led to a kitchen any professional chef would probably envy . And there , in front of the stove , stood Sam , his curls just starting to form as his hair dried , dressed in a snug pair of designer jeans and a polo shirt . She watched as he filled two plates skillfully , like he actually cooked all the time . Her eyes darted nervously to her handbag that was sitting on the counter , and the paperwork she had carelessly stuffed inside the side pocket now resting underneath it . She sidled up to the counter , sliding the paperwork from underneath her purse , folding it , and cramming it into the center part of bag , closing the zipper tightly . “I
12639	12647	12630	12630	I	10	” His voice was low , menacing . “You
12651	12674	12630	12630	I	10	” Folding her arms in front of her , she scowled at him , resting one hip against the counter beside him . “Not
12698	12716	12717	12717	You	171	” He put the two plates on the kitchen table and pulled out one of the chairs . “
12731	12737	12723	12723	Maddie	855	” he told her adamantly . “
12741	12759	12723	12723	Maddie	855	” He sat a large mug of coffee beside her plate , the smell making her salivate . “Actually
12820	12933	12936	12936	me	10	” She was thirty - four years old , would turn thirty - five this year . Artificial insemination had just been something she wanted to consider . She ’d probably never marry , but she wanted a child so badly . She had actually hoped for more than one when she was younger . She headed for the table , intent on grabbing the coffee . Before she had even taken a step , Sam snagged her arm , bringing her back against the counter , her ass pressed up against the unyielding wood as Sam slapped a muscular arm on each side of her , trapping her with his body . “
12964	13007	12956	12956	you	10	” he growled , his intense eyes flashing as he looked down at her face , the muscles in his jaw clenched tight . She met his gaze with a fiery one of her own , her anger flaring as she retorted , “
13023	13036	13037	13037	he	10	”“You do n’t like sex ? Not with any of your partners ? ”
13044	13096	13037	13037	he	10	“Partner . As in one boyfriend . Tried it , did n’t like it , did n’t do it again . Lance said I was n’t a sexual woman and I probably have to agree with him . I had to have a few drinks just to let him do it . ”“And
13130	13138	13120	13120	You	855	” he said in a husky voice . “
13162	13182	13183	13183	she	179	”“Doesn’t matter . No desire to try it again , which is why I was looking at artificial insemination , ”
13193	13246	13247	13247	he	10	“If there ’s any inseminating to be done , I ’m doing it . And it wo n’t be done in a sterile environment with a Petri - dish . All you need is a man who wants to please you to the point of insanity . And that would be me , ”
13507	13517	13504	13504	he	181	“ Wrap your legs around my waist , Maddie . ”So
13638	13648	13632	13632	Maddie	855	“ Sam . Oh , my God , Sam . ”Her
13686	13697	13675	13675	she	179	“You’re fucking beautiful , Maddie . So aroused for me . ”
13758	13770	13771	13771	Her	179	“Sam , I ca n’t take it . I ca n’t . ”
13801	13811	13812	13812	he	181	“You’re so fucking wet . Take what you need , ”
13817	13821	13822	13822	she	179	“I need you , ”
13859	13871	13879	13879	she	179	“ Climax , Maddie . I want to watch you come . ”As
13915	13935	13936	13936	her	179	“ Fuck . I love feeling you come . I wish you were coming around my cock right now . ”As
14020	14029	14007	14007	she	179	“ Oh God , what have I done ? ”
14071	14101	14063	14063	He	785	“ You got off . Hard . So do n’t tell me you do n’t like sex , Maddie . You like it with me . Only with me . ”
14129	14156	14157	14157	He	785	“ Fuck . I ’ll never be able to forget your smell , your incredible taste . I should have made you come with my mouth . ”
14168	14180	14157	14157	He	785	“ Now I want to taste you . All of you . ”
14265	14271	14272	14272	she	179	“ I ’ll be back , ”
14284	14286	14272	14272	she	179	“Hey . ”
14299	14310	14287	14287	Sam	785	“ You ’re blushing . You ’re not embarrassed , are you?”She
14313	14330	14331	14331	he	785	“Why ? Do n’t be . That was the most erotic thing I ’ve ever seen , ”
14345	14363	14331	14331	he	785	“I - I - don’t do those sort of things . I do n’t react that way . ”
14372	14378	14368	14368	She	179	“ We hate each other . ”Grabbing
14388	14406	14383	14383	he	785	“ You may hate me , but I ’ve never hated you , Maddie . Not ever . ”
14419	14428	14413	14413	he	785	“ Sit . I ’ll nuke our food . ”After
14483	14493	14473	14473	Sam	785	“ Eat something , Maddie . Do you want more coffee?”She
14498	14504	14495	14495	her	179	“ Maybe in a while . ”He
14542	14548	14521	14521	He	785	“ Very creative , Sunshine . ”She
14555	14582	14521	14521	He	785	“ I thought so . Glad you were an extra - large or it might not have been big enough to hold all my hair back . ”“There
14589	14690	14521	14521	He	785	” he answered lightly as he seated himself . She was n’t touching that comment . Watching him as he shoveled in his eggs , bacon and potatoes ravenously , while still looking immaculate , Maddie never would have known that he had just given her the most incredible orgasm of her life with nothing more than his talented fingers and mouth . She shuddered , picking up her fork with fingers that were slightly shaky . Starting slowly due to her lack of interest in food at the moment , she picked up speed , cleaning her plate quickly . “
14705	14712	14713	14713	You	186	”He shot her a wicked grin . “
14757	14798	14752	14752	Simon	10	”He’d really only had a hotplate because his stove did n’t work in his small apartment back then . Still , he was pretty talented . It was the best breakfast she ’d had in a while , even reheated . “
14809	14856	14799	14799	Kara	855	” Maddie smiled , remembering two episodes where Simon had tried to cook . Both had been a nightmare , one episode triggering the fire alarms because of the smoke . Sam dropped his fork and napkin onto the empty plate and picked up his coffee . “
14870	14881	14862	14862	Simon	10	”Maddie gaped at him as she picked up her mug . “
14891	14997	14887	14887	You	855	” Yeah , Sam might be a dog with women , but he was an incredible businessman . She ’d followed the growth of his company , although she would never admit it . Sam had taken the business of developing Simon ’s computer games to a whole new level , and then proceeded to expand Hudson into commercial real estate and other ventures , making it one of the most diversified and powerful corporations in the world . Simon still headed the computer game development portion , but Sam was responsible for much of their billionaire status with the other ventures . Sam shrugged . “
15015	15068	15007	15007	Simon	10	”“You really think that ? I know he did the initial designs , but who sold them , marketed them , who invested and started the other ventures ? He may be the brilliant game developer , but you ’re the genius in business . It took both to make the company . ”Sam
15089	15108	15109	15109	her	192	“ Madeline , if I did n’t know better I ’d think you were throwing me a compliment . ”Rolling
15129	15159	15112	15112	she	192	“ I tell the truth as I see it . I may not like you for the most part , but I ca n’t deny that you ’re successful . ”
15181	15189	15169	15169	He	10	“ We need to talk , Maddie . ”“Actually
15209	15258	15197	15197	I	10	” she told him lightly , not wanting to hear whatever he had to say . His tone was too serious , too much like the Sam she used to know , and it made her weak with longing , yearning for something that could never happen again . “You
15265	15291	15294	15294	me	10	” he grumbled , his expression implacable . Instead of sitting , she grabbed the coffee mug and took a sip , eyeing him cautiously . “
15325	15357	15320	15320	I	10	” It seemed like the fastest way to get away from him . And she needed to remove herself from the presence of the hottest man she ever known . Immediately . “You
15373	15392	15393	15393	You	195	” he growled , taking her coffee mug from her hand and sitting it back on the table . “
15405	15416	15393	15393	You	195	”Crossing her arms in front of her , she mumbled , “
15420	15505	15506	15506	He	196	that?”“I want you to leave your job at the hospital and work full - time at the clinic . As a paid physician . I ’ll start your salary at a half million a year and you can do all of your work in the daytime there . I want you out of there before dark and you ca n’t work more than five days a week . It will give you more time there without the stress of having to juggle two jobs . ”
15513	15526	15527	15527	she	197	“It ’s a free clinic . I ca n’t take a salary , ”
15532	15577	15527	15527	she	197	“It ’s run on donations . I can up my donations and pay your salary myself . I have a lot of contacts who would be more than willing to help you back the clinic . All I have to do is call them . ”
15702	15726	15730	15730	she	197	“I’m not worth that much money . I ’m just a family practice doctor . I do n’t earn that kind of salary . ”
15781	15787	15788	15788	she	197	“ What ’s the catch ? ”
15792	15824	15788	15788	she	197	“ There ’s nothing in it for you except a bigger tax deduction if you take it on as a charitable organization . Why put yourself to this much trouble for my clinic?”“I
15850	15854	15841	15841	I	10	” He shrugged . “
15873	15902	15904	15904	my	10	”He was manipulating her , and she did n’t like it . However , it was hard not to accept when it was something she had always wanted . “
15937	15971	15972	15972	He	10	”“No . The salary gets paid and I ’ll pay your student loans off . I ’ll make sure your donations are enough to pay staff and buy state of the art equipment . ”
16006	16013	15991	15991	Maddie	855	“ Why are you doing this ? Really?”“I’m
16019	16029	15996	15996	she	855	” he replied , his eyes boring into her . “
16035	16040	16041	16041	we	208	” he admitted reluctantly . “Are
16045	16106	16041	16041	we	208	” she asked , wanting to know she ’d be legally protected . She wanted to believe that Sam was sincere , but she ’d never be taken in by him again . One massive heartache was more than enough . He ’d taken her trust once and smashed it to bits , making her suspicious of anything he offered . “No
16116	16124	16041	16041	we	208	” he rumbled , his voice husky . “What
16129	16135	16139	16139	you	207	” What more could he possibly offer?“I
16142	16147	16148	16148	You	207	” he said harshly . “
16181	16193	16198	16198	my	10	”Maddie gasped , her heart racing . Was the guy crazy ? “
16200	16259	16260	16260	He	8	donor?”“Hell , no . Or yes … I do … but we do it the old - fashioned way . I ’m willing to try for as long as it takes . Every day . Five times a day . Or until you beg for mercy , and even then I ’m still not sure I ’ll stop . ”
16310	16324	16299	16299	she	212	“ That takes having sex . A lot of sex . Unprotected sex . ”
16330	16378	16299	16299	she	212	“ I do n’t like sex and you ’re a man - whore , Sam . You could n’t go a week without another woman . I wo n’t be enough for you . And I definitely do n’t want to share diseases with your lady friends . ”
16404	16415	16419	16419	he	785	“I’m clean . I ’ll give you my health records . ”
16442	16466	16467	16467	she	212	“I ca n’t . I trusted you once . I ca n’t do it again . Especially not with a possible child involved , ”
16608	16652	16653	16653	he	899	“I have n’t been with a woman in months . I fucking could n’t . Before that I only slept with women who had red hair , curvy bodies and who did n’t mind that I called out your name when I came , ”
16656	16675	16653	16653	he	899	“ Women who only wanted money or material things , because I had nothing else to give them . ”“Sam
16684	16726	16727	16727	He	899	week-”“Friends who go with me to various functions . I do n’t sleep with them . I have no desire to sleep with a tall , skinny blonde . I ’m too fucking obsessed with a petite redhead who hates me . ”
16780	16803	16778	16778	he	899	“ I ca n’t . It will never work . I ca n’t sleep with you , get pregnant and walk away . ”
16807	16819	16820	16820	His	899	me!“If you fucking walked away , I ’d come after you . ”
16841	16849	16850	16850	she	221	“Then why did you even suggest it ? ”
16854	16884	16886	16886	you	223	“I do n’t think you understand , Madeline . I ’m not asking to just knock you up or fuck you , although God knows I want that too . ”“What
16887	16903	16904	16904	I	10	want?”He took a deep breath , letting it out slowly , his whole body tense . “
16967	17380	17382	17382	you	226	”Sam took another deep breath … and waited . Chapter 5 Sam held his breath , watching Maddie ’s expression change to one of incredibility , as her mind tried to absorb what he ’d just said . Shock . Disbelief . Horror . All of those emotions reflected back at him from her hazel eyes . Christ ! He had n’t meant to say that . He had n’t meant to say any of it , except for the proposition to help her make her clinic a full - time paid venture to make her life easier . But then he ’d seen those damn papers , and he ’d completely lost it . No man is planting his seed inside my woman , artificially done or not . If she wants a baby , I ’ll give her one or happily die trying . Rampant , possessive emotions rose inside him until his vision blurred , his fists clenched with need to own the woman in front of him , a woman he ’d wanted for what seemed like forever . The last time he had walked away from her , he had done it because he thought she ’d be better off without him . Fuck it . He was n’t doing that again . She obviously was n’t happy , some guy had treated her like shit , and she did n’t have the family she had always wanted . She was alone . Or , she had been alone . Now , Sam was determined that she would have him . Forever . Even if she hated him , he would treat her better than another man could , take better care of her ; meet all of her needs until she begged for mercy . Bullshit … she does n’t like sex ! She had just never had a man who wanted to please her . Maddie was a firecracker that he wanted to set off . Hell … he wanted to do an entire fireworks display with her , one orgasm after another , until she begged him to stop , her body limp and sated . Sam never saw the palm coming toward his face , his fantasies and desires so potent that he was lost in them . The smack landed hard enough to jerk his head to the right , and it was loud enough to be heard echoing through the kitchen . “How
17407	17419	17393	17393	You	226	” Maddie hissed , her eyes furious and filled with tears . “
17432	17450	17430	17430	Hudson	785	”Sam caught her wrist just as she was about to let her hand fly a second time . “
17453	17470	17430	17430	Hudson	785	” He held her wrist tightly enough to immobilize it , but not enough to hurt . “
17506	17541	17486	17486	I	10	”“You’re a damn liar . You do n’t want to marry me or even fund my clinic . This is some kind of sick , twisted joke . And I do n’t understand why . ”
17557	17562	17563	17563	He	99	“Goddamn it , Maddie . ”
17587	17602	17571	17571	She	99	“ It ’s not a fucking joke . I ’m not twisted . Much . ”
17703	17711	17712	17712	I	10	“ Please do n’t cry , Maddie . ”
17760	17769	17752	17752	She	99	“ Let go . I want to leave . ”“The
17811	17829	17835	17835	you	232	” He sighed , frustrated . She turned her head and nailed him with a searching look . “
17845	17859	17860	17860	he	99	other-”“You hate me . I do n’t hate you . I never have , ”
17874	17939	17940	17940	She	234	“You did n’t want to fuck me , either . And you did n’t even respect me enough to break up with me before you fucked her . I cared about you , Sam . And seeing you with that woman made a mockery of everything we ever shared . Our friendship . Our relationship . Everything was just one big joke on me . ”
17962	17964	17958	17958	she	234	“Maddie , I-”“So
17988	18017	18018	18018	I	10	” she finished , running a shaky hand through her hair to thrust back her wayward curls from her face , her face still damp from spent tears . “
18034	18049	18050	18050	he	785	car?”“No . You ’re staying . The rehearsal is starting in a few hours , ”
18057	18069	18050	18050	he	785	“ You did n’t give me an answer on my proposal . ”“Because
18097	18101	18102	18102	You	237	” she gasped . “
18141	18150	18151	18151	he	785	ago-”“Because I did n’t have a goddamn choice , ”
18164	18206	18151	18151	he	785	“ I had to get you away from me so you did n’t get hurt . That woman , who was at least fifteen years older than me , was a fucking FBI agent . Did you even look at her ? ”
18231	18256	18257	18257	Maddie	855	“All I remember is that she was pretty and she had her tongue down your throat . And your hands were all over her , ”
18269	18494	18257	18257	Maddie	855	“She was good at her job . We were meeting to try to find a way to protect you . That ’s why I asked you to come and meet me for coffee . Kate said the best way to protect you was to alienate you , but I could n’t do it . I cared too damn much . She told me if I really cared about you , I ’d worry about your safety first . She was right , but I did n’t know how to walk away from you , even though I knew somehow I had to so I would know you were safe . So when she saw you coming , she did it herself by shoving her tongue down my throat . She convinced me that making you hate me was the way to save you , so yeah , I played into it . I did n’t know whether to thank her or hate her fucking guts afterward . I hated having my hands on a woman who was n’t you , Maddie . I hated it while it was happening , knowing you were watching and feeling betrayed . And if you think I have n’t lived with the regret of having to do that every fucking day since it happened … you’d be wrong . ”
18571	18601	18602	18603	the FBI	239	“ I did n’t want to hurt you , but the thought of something happening to you made me so crazy that I did what I had to do . ”“Why
18613	18640	18602	18603	the FBI	239	” Maddie questioned , her voice still full of doubt and confusion . He sat back on the couch , resting his head against the leather . “
18671	18673	18674	18674	she	855	”“Yes , ”
18677	18689	18674	18674	she	855	“ You told me . He died soon after we met . ”“I
18777	18791	18761	18761	I	10	” He took a deep breath and blew it out before he continued . “
18975	18983	18984	18984	you	253	”“I would have stayed with you , done whatever-”“And
18998	19013	18991	18991	I	10	” He sat up , grasping Maddie by the shoulders , shaking her lightly . “
19068	19109	19118	19118	Sam	785	” he growled , his emotions ready to explode from his body . Perspiration poured down his face , a reaction he had every time he thought about what had happened to Simon and what could have happened to Maddie . “What
19120	19129	19118	19118	Sam	785	” Maddie answered quietly , her voice soothing . “Bullshit
19158	19169	19174	19174	yourself	263	” Releasing Maddie , he slumped back on the couch . “You
19180	19197	19198	19198	he	10	known?”“I should have known . I ’d seen these people in action since I could walk , ”
19204	19218	19219	19219	Maddie	855	“Why did n’t you find me later ? After the whole thing ended ? ”
19226	19263	19264	19264	he	10	“It took over a year until every branch of the organization was closed down . My mother , Simon and I were under FBI protection here in Tampa until every boss was behind bars or dead , ”
19273	19282	19264	19264	he	10	“But after that , why did n’t you find me?”“I
19285	19340	19343	19343	you	264	” Sam clenched his fists , hating to think about the day he had gone to find her . He ’d already known he had lost her , but that particular day was the time that it really sunk in , that he had to admit to himself that his Maddie was gone forever . “I
19346	19352	19354	19354	you	264	” she answered , confused . “I
19376	19384	19385	19385	I	10	” He frowned , his face fierce . “
19445	19451	19435	19435	I	10	” Fuck . That hurt . “Lance
19453	19457	19435	19435	I	10	” she whispered . “
19477	19572	19573	19573	Maddie	855	”“Why ? All it would have done is screwed up your life . I did n’t have a fucking thing to offer , Maddie . I was barely out of danger from a lengthy FBI involvement . Broker than shit from trying to support my family . Simon was going to school . I stopped so he could study . Once he was old enough to work part - time I went back to finish my own degree . You had a guy who looked like a much better option than me back then . ”
19618	19682	19683	19683	God	10	“ Had I known that he was a bastard who was n’t going to marry you and who treated you poorly , I would have taken you away from him in a fucking heartbeat . I assume that he was the one sexual relationship you mentioned ? That guy was the son of a bitch who told you that you were n’t sexy ? ”
19721	19734	19735	19735	She	855	“Yeah . We did n’t really date that long . Six months . ”
19752	19764	19765	19765	you	278	“ I was so lonely and I wanted to forget you . ”“And
19773	19788	19765	19765	you	278	” he asked , his voice gentler , curious . Maddie shook her head . “
19802	19826	19829	19829	Maddie	855	”Sam reached out his hand and captured one of the tears on her cheek with his finger and brought it to his lips . “
19842	19845	19846	19846	She	855	”“Except you . ”
19850	19866	19867	19867	he	10	“You have n’t gotten away from me yet , and this time you wo n’t , ”
19871	19922	19867	19867	he	10	“ I want you to marry me . You never gave me an answer . Sam looked at the agonized expression on her face and it nearly brought him to his knees . He needed her to say yes . Desperately . His sanity was beginning to depend on it . “We
19941	19947	19931	19931	I	10	” she told him honestly . “Say
19950	20001	19931	19931	I	10	”Oh , fuck yeah . Saying no was not an option . Sam moved her onto his lap . He needed to hold her right now , had to have her softness in his arms . She squealed and tried to squirm away , but he did n’t let her . “
20020	20026	19931	19931	I	10	” he warned her ominously . “
20056	20067	20041	20041	I	10	”She stilled immediately and wrapped her arms around his neck . “
20073	20088	20041	20041	I	10	” she asked curiously , resting her head on his shoulder . Sam shrugged . “
20148	20161	20136	20136	she	29	” He thrust a hand into her hair , massaging her scalp . “
20169	20194	20136	20136	she	29	Maddie?”“Sam , I have n’t even digested the information you just told me . You ca n’t expect me to agree to marry you . ”
20205	20231	20232	20232	he	283	“If you do n’t believe me , you can ask Simon . He does n’t know about us , but he can verify everything else , ”
20252	20262	20263	20263	She	29	“It is n’t that . I just need time . ”
20266	20286	20263	20263	She	29	“ It ’s been years , Sam . We ’ve changed . We do n’t know each other now . ”“We’ve
20304	20332	20294	20294	My	10	” And it was the truth . It had n’t taken him more than a moment to see her value , to know that she was special . “
20341	20360	20366	20366	you	14	” He was feeling magnanimous now that he had her exactly where he wanted her . Maddie snorted . “
20380	20392	20369	20369	I	10	”Tilting her face , he speared her with a possessive glance . “
20395	20400	20401	20401	she	284	longer?”“I do n’t know , ”
20433	20468	20470	20470	her	284	“ I ’ll seduce you . Then I ’ll fuck you until you do n’t have the strength to say anything except yes . No one is planting their seed inside you except me . ”Maddie
20473	20498	20503	20503	Sam	785	“ Nobody has ever planted their seed inside me . Lance used a condom and I have n’t had anything but my vibrator since . ”Something
20571	20578	20579	20579	he	785	“ And how ’s the vibrator ? ”
20599	20611	20590	20590	She	855	“ Batteries are probably dead . It ’s been a while . ”Christ
20619	20626	20627	20627	he	785	“ You wo n’t need it , ”
20654	20668	20651	20651	she	855	“ Is it true that you did n’t go to bed with all those women?”“What
20736	20747	20749	20749	you	292	” he answered , his voice husky against her skin . “I
20757	20849	20751	20751	I	10	” she replied , her voice filled with pain and sadness . Unable to stop himself , Sam slipped Maddie off his lap and under him , covering her petite body with his larger frame . She felt so sweet , so soft beneath him that he groaned as she opened her thighs to welcome him , and he felt like he was finally home , exactly where he was supposed to be . The feel of her body , her enticing fragrance surrounded him , sinking into his every pore . “
20864	20956	20957	20957	I	10	” he answered gruffly , lowering his body to hers while keeping most of his weight off her with his elbows , needing all of her softness . He buried his face in her silky curls , letting himself completely absorb her , breathing her in over and over again until every part of him was filled with her scent . Mine . Need her . She ’ll never have another man as long as I ’m breathing . A low , incoherent sound left his throat , feral and unrestrained . “
20979	21241	20973	20973	you	294	”He lowered his mouth to hers before she could reply , swallowing any protest she might have made . He did n’t give a shit what words left her mouth , he was taking what should have been his years ago . Maybe he should have confessed everything the first time he had seen her again last year , but he had n’t gotten close to her , afraid that she had a man in her life , a man who was better for her than him . Now that he knew the truth , that she had never been cherished as she should have been , he was n’t letting her go . She tasted of sweet coffee and raw temptation , and it nearly drove him mad . He covered her mouth over and over , trying to brand her as his , needing her to forget every man in the world except him . His cock pulsated and he thrust his pelvis into her core , groaning into her mouth as he was greeted with nothing but heat and the promise of ecstasy . He snaked his forearms under her back , trying to pull her closer , her breasts tighter against his chest . Fuck ! He needed more . More of her , more of her heat . She moaned into his mouth as he plundered again , sweeping his tongue into the wet , warm cavity , greedy for her sweetness , wallowing in her essence . Pulling his mouth from hers , he rasped , “
21251	21264	21265	21265	Maddie	855	”“Sam , someone is at the door . I heard the doorbell , ”
21321	21328	21311	21311	he	10	“ Christ . It ’s Simon . ”
21336	21342	21329	21329	He	10	“ We finish this later . ”Maddie
21352	21362	21329	21329	He	10	“ Not happening . They ’re staying until Saturday , right?”“Yeah
21366	21384	21329	21329	He	10	” Sam did n’t care if they stayed , as long as he had Maddie with him . “I’m
21395	21401	21407	21407	Sam	785	” Maddie scowled at him . “
21434	21474	21425	21425	I	10	” She ran a hand through her hair , but it only made her curls wilder . Sam ’s eyes raked over her disheveled appearance with male satisfaction . She looked like a woman who had just been ravished . “
21489	21508	21482	21482	You	300	” he replied belligerently . Maddie jumped up from the couch and gathered her hair in a ponytail . “
21514	21520	21509	21509	I	10	”Sam looked at her sardonically . “
21543	21571	21538	21538	I	10	”“No . I ’ll get it . You get the door . Poor Simon and Kara are standing on the doorstep , probably wondering where you are . ”“I
21593	21613	21591	21591	bro	303	” Sam grumbled , heading for the door . Maddie giggled , covering her mouth to stifle the sound . “
21629	21689	21591	21591	bro	303	” she told him as she sashayed across the room . Sam groaned , watching her prance to the kitchen , that sweet ass wiggling enticingly as she went , in a pair of jeans he never should have asked David to buy . They were too provocative , cupped her ass too perfectly . Batteries ? Why did she need-?”Oh
21768	21776	21777	21777	he	305	“You’ll pay for this one , Sunshine , ”
22350	22358	22344	22344	Simon	34	“ She ’s mine . Move on . ”Maddie
22696	22712	22713	22713	Sam	785	“I saw Max fucking you with his eyes . Do n’t even think about it , ”
22729	22733	22734	22734	she	855	“Who ’s Max ? ”
22749	22794	22740	22740	she	855	“Maxwell Hamilton . The bastard who was checking you out in the front row . He could n’t take his eyes off you . Not that I blame him . But he better stay the fuck away from you or I ’ll kill him , ”
22856	22866	22834	22835	Max Hamilton	619	“ You ’re obviously friends . He ’s here . ”“Yeah
22893	22898	22888	22888	he	619	” he answered briskly . “
22908	22975	22899	22899	We	335	”The wedding had broken up and people were making their way to the lovely tents that were set up at the waterfront with tables of food , a bar and a monstrous cake . The sun was beginning to set and the reception area took on a fairytale appearance . Maddie took a deep breath of the salty , humid air , enjoying the mild evening . “
22981	22985	22899	22899	We	335	” she sighed . “Yeah
23001	23025	22996	22996	I	10	” Sam ’s gaze was trained on her , his eyes moving over her , lingering at the plunging neckline of her dress . “Once
23029	23135	22996	22996	I	10	” she answered , blushing as he continued to stare . Actually , he ’d told her at least five times since she had come down the stairs to make her way to the area where the ceremony was being held , and her face had flushed every damn time . It was n’t the words that Sam said , it was the way he said them . He might as well have told her that he needed to fuck her or die , so needy was his tone , the timbre of his voice sending chills down her spine and moisture to her pussy . “How
23145	23161	23137	23137	you	336	” he asked , his voice husky and desperate as he fingered the delicate sleeve . “I
23165	23180	23137	23137	you	336	” she whispered back to him , giving him a look of feigned innocence . “
23186	23221	23223	23223	Maddie	855	”A deep , vibrating groan came from his throat , sending a thrill to her core . Only with Sam had she ever felt this kind of feminine power , and it was heady . “Jesus
23248	23255	23237	23237	I	10	” His jaw was clenched tight . “
23282	23495	23496	23496	Sam	785	”He took her hand , his grasp completely encapsulating her smaller one , and twined his fingers through hers in a proprietary way that had her heart leaping with joy . Every one of the wedding preparations had gone incredibly smoothly , everything perfectly planned . All the wedding party had to do was enjoy the festivities . Watching Simon and Kara together for the last few days had been achingly poignant , but satisfying . Maddie had no doubt that her friend would be happy with Simon . The two of them were like two parts of a whole , so happy together that it was almost painful to watch . Kara had been through so much , suffered for so much of her life alone . Maddie was grateful that Kara finally had a man who would make her ecstatically happy . Her friend was pregnant , but not enough to be showing yet . Although Maddie had n’t thought it possible , it had made Simon even more protective and nurturing with Kara . They would both make good parents . Any child born to the two of them would be blessed . Sam tugged her hand , leading her toward the luxurious silk tent closest to the water . “
23503	23560	23563	23563	Sunshine	14	” she reminded him as she yanked on his hand , pointing at her feet when he turned . They were walking across the lawn , and she was n’t used to stiletto heels . If he did n’t slow it down she was going to turn her damn ankle . He looked at her remorsefully . “
23572	23588	23565	23565	I	10	” He scooped her up in his arms and cradled her close to his chest . “
23592	23602	23603	23603	I	10	” he said , shooting her a wicked grin . “
23609	23613	23614	23614	she	338	”“Put me down , ”
23619	23624	23614	23614	she	338	“ Everyone is watching . ”
23668	23673	23674	23674	he	785	“ Let them watch , ”
23679	23692	23693	23693	she	338	“Damn it , Sam . Are you trying to cop a feel ? ”
23735	23762	23763	23763	He	785	“Yep . I ’m trying to get a look down that skimpy bodice too . A guy takes what he can get when he ’s desperate . ”
23926	23932	23933	23933	he	785	“What are you thinking about ? ”
23951	23954	23955	23955	she	855	“ You , ”
23971	24014	24015	24015	he	785	“ If you do n’t stop looking at me like that , I ’m taking you into the house , stripping you naked and fucking you until you beg me to stop . And then I ’ll do it all over again , ”
24057	24063	24064	24064	she	855	“ Simon ’s wedding reception , ”
24068	24073	24075	24075	her	855	“ Put me down . ”He
24091	24100	24101	24101	He	785	“ I do n’t want to let go . ”
24173	24185	24186	24186	She	855	“ I think I need that drink you were talking about . ”
24200	24205	24206	24206	he	785	“What do you want ? ”
24226	24235	24236	24236	She	855	“I’m not familiar with drinks . You choose . ”
24326	24328	24329	24331	a low baritone	345	“Hello , ”
24400	24403	24404	24404	she	855	“ Hi , ”
24408	24417	24418	24418	He	345	“Max Hamilton . I wanted to meet you . ”
24429	24441	24425	24425	Maddie	855	“ Maddie Reynolds . Nice to meet you , Mr. Hamilton . ”“Please
24447	24464	24465	24466	Dr. Reynolds	855	” he said suavely , pulling his hand from hers and seating himself across from her . “
24476	24480	24468	24468	Kara	855	”“Call me Maddie . ”
24544	24547	24548	24548	he	785	“Beautiful wedding , ”
24561	24564	24565	24565	Maddie	855	“Beautiful couple , ”
24572	24581	24565	24565	Maddie	855	“You and Kara both look lovely , Maddie . ”She
24613	24632	24602	24602	He	785	“ I take it you did n’t bring a date . I did n’t see you with anyone . ”
24671	24685	24656	24656	He	785	“ No . I was married . I lost her two years ago . ”“I’m
24688	24704	24706	24706	you	351	” Maddie suddenly wished she had n’t asked . His face grew pensive and sad . “What
24729	24737	24721	24721	You	351	” he observed , his voice amused . “I
24742	24747	24748	24748	you	351	” she answered truthfully . “Would
24756	24804	24754	24754	Maddie	855	” he asked , his expression earnest . There was something in his eyes , something in his voice that made her want to say yes . Maybe it was the emptiness she saw in his expression or a loneliness she sensed behind his rather mysterious exterior . “
24815	24829	24830	24830	me	10	” It was only dinner , so she had no reason to refuse . “Give
24834	24872	24873	24873	Sam	785	” He pulled out his cell . She rattled it off , finishing just as Sam stepped back to the table with their drinks . Max smiled , depositing his cell back into his pocket and standing . “
24877	24888	24889	24889	I	10	you?”Sam ’s face was like stone , his expression grim . “
24900	24916	24889	24889	I	10	” he answered gruffly as he plopped the drinks on the table and faced Max . “Jesus
24933	24950	24927	24927	I	10	” Max took a step , as though he were ready to face off with Sam . “Did
24958	24968	24971	24971	Sam	785	” Sam growled , shooting Maddie a disapproving look . “Sit
24981	24993	24996	24996	Maddie	855	” She smiled at Max and gave Sam a warning look . “You
24998	25019	25020	25020	You	351	” Max shook her hand again and leaned down beside her ear to ask in a low , concerned voice , “
25028	25033	25034	25034	He	785	”She rolled her eyes . “
25042	25048	25038	25038	I	10	”“I’ll talk to you later . ”
25100	25109	25110	25110	His	619	“ You are not going anywhere with him . ”
25140	25149	25121	25121	Maddie	855	“ Umm … that ’s good . What is it?”“White
25152	25157	25121	25121	Maddie	855	” he answered briskly . “
25163	25182	25183	25183	She	855	Madeline?”“I’m ignoring you until you do something other than give me orders . I do n’t like it . ”
25200	25224	25225	25225	he	785	“Hamilton is no good for you , Maddie . He ’s never gotten over his late wife . He ’d make you miserable , ”
25236	25241	25242	25242	she	855	“He looks so lonely , ”
25246	25263	25264	25264	he	785	“He is and I ’m sorry for his pain , but you are n’t the answer , ”
25268	25292	25264	25264	he	785	“ You ’re already taken by a man who needs you desperately . You ’re mine , Sunshine . You always have been . ”She
25342	25380	25381	25381	She	855	“ You ca n’t just give me orders and expect me to blindly obey , Sam . I make my own decisions . I always have . I ’m not the naïve young woman you once knew . ”
25427	25431	25414	25414	He	785	“Let go dance . ”
25604	25615	25616	25616	Sam	785	“Our duty is done . Let ’s take a walk , ”
25712	25720	25721	25721	Sam	785	“ Nobody else comes down here tonight , ”
25738	25751	25752	25753	the guard	875	“Yes , Mr. Hudson . I ’ll make sure they do n’t , ”
25814	25822	25775	25775	Maddie	855	“ It ’s beautiful . Is this your dock?”“Yes
25832	25854	25775	25775	Maddie	855	” he answered ominously . Maddie stepped onto the dock , careful that her heels did n’t catch in the slats . “
25863	25881	25861	25861	Kara	855	” she asked , trying not to sound jealous because Sam had once hit on her friend . “It
25922	25935	25912	25912	I	10	” he answered , as he swung Maddie up in his arms . “
25979	26073	25973	25973	She	855	”She wanted to object to Sam carrying her , taking her weight , but he did n’t look in the least bit stressed , striding down the walkway to a structure further down the wooden dock . She wrapped her arms around his neck and put her head on his shoulder , knowing she could get used to this so very easily . Sam was such a hot alpha male who called to everything feminine inside her that she just wanted to melt into him , let him protect her for a while . “
26079	26084	26076	26076	your	369	” she questioned curiously . “A
26094	26158	26076	26076	your	369	” he replied gruffly , reaching the structure and bolting up a set of stairs . Maddie ’s mouth opened in shock as he reached the top , pushing open a screen door with his shoulder . The upper floor was screened to keep bugs away , and one entire wall was made of glass , providing an awesome view of the water . “
26163	26223	26076	26076	your	369	” she whispered as Sam lowered her feet to the ground . Obviously , someone had been expecting him . The place was decorated in all - weather patio furniture , but there were candles lit on every table and a bottle of champagne sat on ice with two fluted glasses next to a huge , cushy double lounger . “I
26237	26254	26255	26255	I	10	” Sam said casually , pulling his tuxedo jacket off and throwing it on a chair . “
26260	26268	26269	26269	Maddie	855	”“But you do n’t have a boat ? ”
26293	26307	26284	26284	He	10	“ Never needed one . I can be on the water right here . ”
26315	26341	26308	26308	He	10	“ Come here . I want to discuss your little comment about batteries , and how that ’s affected me for the last few days . ”Maddie
26381	26402	26403	26403	he	10	“Don’t even think about it . I can be up and catching you within seconds , especially in those shoes , ”
26414	26426	26403	26403	he	10	“ Either come to me or I ’ll come get you . ”She
26469	26475	26476	26476	she	372	“ You ’re so bossy , ”
26484	26509	26510	26510	he	10	“I always have been . You ’re just noticing that now ? Simon started accusing me of it from the time he could speak , ”
26560	26566	26567	26567	she	372	“ You ’re different now , ”
26621	26627	26628	26628	he	785	“Is that good or bad ? ”
26648	26650	26651	26651	she	372	“Neither , ”
26679	26692	26693	26693	he	785	“How have the new batteries been working out for you , Madeline ? ”
26710	26721	26702	26702	She	372	“ They were very … um … stimulating , thanks . ”“I
26764	26781	26752	26752	I	10	” His voice sounded desperate , and he pulled the tiny sleeve of her dress lower . “
26829	26895	26896	26896	Sam	785	” The bodice started to slip as he inched the dress down further . His hand entered the bodice from the side , pushing his way between the material and her bare breast . Maddie ’s core flooded with heat , her nipples already hard and sensitive from his erotic words . She gasped as he cupped her breast possessively , lightly pinching her nipple . “
26898	26970	26971	26971	You	785	” she murmured in a needy voice she barely recognized as her own . He rolled her beneath him in a smooth maneuver that left her staring up at him longingly . Her breath hitched as she saw the hunger and need shining in those emerald eyes above her , a sight she had wanted to see for so very long from this one man , an erotic fantasy come true . “
27004	27034	27039	27039	Sam	785	”Yes . Yes . Yes . Her whole being craved Sam Hudson , and only him . His domination aroused her , his scent enveloped her in carnal desire . “
27041	27066	27039	27039	Sam	785	” No more waiting , no more questioning ; there was only this man for her . He had always been the only one . “You’re
27079	27119	27076	27076	you	855	” he demanded , his hands pulling the sleeves down her arms , lowering the top half of her dress until her breasts sprang free , leaving her arms trapped to her sides by the straps he had lowered . “I’ll
27124	27192	27076	27076	you	855	” she agreed , moaning as his mouth lowered to her breasts , his hands pushing them together so he could switch from one breast to the other easily . His mouth bit gently at one nipple , then suckled it erotically before switching to the other . Back and forth , over and over , until Maddie was out of her mind from the pleasurable torment . “Promise
27194	27231	27076	27076	you	855	” he commanded , flicking her nipple with his tongue . She undulated her hips , thrusting her core against his hard erection , needing friction , needing to be filled , needing all of him . “
27248	27508	27510	27510	Maddie	855	” she told him vehemently as she yanked her arms outward , tearing the small sleeves without an ounce of regret , in order to free her hands to be able to touch him . Her hands speared through his curls , holding his head against her breast , urging him to give her more . Moving her trembling fingers down his back , she wrapped her legs around his waist and ground her pelvis against his groin , desperate . Lifting his head from her breast , Sam took her mouth , a dominant claiming that had her moaning against his thrusting tongue and grinding her saturated pussy harder against his cock . His embrace was wild and rampant ; his hands holding the back of her head , his desperate fingers making the clips in her hair fly away , keeping her still for his possession . Their tongues tangled in a hungry duel , both wild and untamed . With a tormented , masculine groan , Sam came to his knees . He ripped off his tie and vest , tearing the buttons off without even taking the time to unfasten them . His shirt followed in the same manner , all of the discarded items hitting the floor without a care . Maddie sat up from her reclining position and Sam immediately grasped the zipper on the back of dress , lowered it and tugged the dress to her hips and then down her thighs as she lifted her ass for him to remove it . “Christ
27528	27727	27510	27510	Maddie	855	” he growled , standing to discard the rest of his clothing . His eyes never left her body as she reclined again . He stared blatantly as he removed his pants , socks and boxers , his eyes emanating liquid desire . She gaped as she saw his cock standing erect and enormous against his ripped abs , her empty pussy clenching with need . Sam had a body that probably haunted every woman ’s fantasies . Big , muscular and perfect . For her , he was the whole package , he was her Sam all over , including the intent , erotic look that he was shooting her from those intense eyes . Always body conscious , she should have been embarrassed , but she was n’t . Sam liked her curvy body and she was in excellent aerobic shape , working out several days a week . Seeing the look on his face , she did n’t regret a single curve at the moment . He obviously appreciated her rounded hips and larger than average breasts . He made her feel like a sex goddess , a very unusual and erotic feeling for her . “Come
27729	27752	27510	27510	Maddie	855	” she begged him , her arms reaching for him . She needed to feel his body against hers , filling her . “No
27758	27769	27754	27754	You	377	” he told her wickedly , intentionally misunderstanding her meaning . “
27781	27824	27825	27825	Sam	785	”Crawling up the lounger , he settled between her thighs , spreading her legs wide . She was wearing wispy green panties and a pair of nude thigh high stockings with scalloped lace at the top . Suddenly nervous , she stammered , “
27835	27845	27846	27846	he	785	I-”“You’ve never let a guy go down on you ? ”
27865	27870	27871	27871	she	377	“No one ever asked , ”
27896	27898	27899	27899	he	785	“Good , ”
27905	27927	27899	27899	he	785	“ And I ’m not asking , Sunshine . I ’m taking what ’s mine . What ’s always been mine . ”She
27974	27983	27967	27967	she	377	“ Please , Sam . I need you . ”“You
27993	28129	27989	27989	You	855	” he answered huskily against her mound . Her panties broke away with a sharp tug and a tearing sound that made her feel only relief , one step closer to their joining . The first touch of his mouth was agony and ecstasy , the sensation unlike anything she had ever felt before . Suddenly , she was glad Sam was the first to do this , the act so intimate that it would have been a sacrilege with anyone else . But not with Sam , never with him . The only thing she felt with Sam was the need for more . She massaged his scalp with a needy moan as his tongue bathed her from bottom to top , hesitating around her clit , circling it until she wanted to scream . “Please
28133	28194	28197	28197	Maddie	855	” She begged as she panted , her back arching as his fingers joined his mouth , holding her folds open with one hand as he eased the index finger of the other into her tight entrance . Yes . Yes . Fill me . I feel so empty . Adding a second finger , he groaned against her pussy , “
28209	28236	28199	28199	You	855	”It had been years , and she was tight , but the stretching felt so incredibly good . She lifted her hips , begging for more . “
28243	28338	28199	28199	You	855	” Her body was ready to spontaneously combust and she was already misted with perspiration , every cell in her body crying out for release . She gripped his head , pulling him tighter against her pussy , needing friction , begging for release . His tongue moved over her clit and he began to devour . He flicked and laved , swallowing her cream with a hungry groan , his fingers fucking her in a wild , abandoned rhythm as he stimulated her clit with his tongue and gentle nips of his mouth . “Sam
28346	28531	28533	28533	Maddie	855	” she hissed , her body clenching , her release rushing up to hit her full force . The walls of her channel clenched tightly around his fingers , as her whole body pulsated and trembled with the powerful climax . Her hands clenched and released in his hair , shuddering as the silken strands fell over her fingers . Incredible . Every one of her senses felt hypersensitive . Panting , she came down slowly as Sam continued to lap at every drop of her orgasm greedily , extending her pleasure until it was almost unbearable . As he came to his knees , she could see every vein in his cock engorged , and his face was fierce , so carnal that her channel spasmed with the desire to have him inside her . Wanting to pleasure him as he had pleasured her , she reached for his massive member , wanting to feel the silky texture of it under her fingers . She sat up , making contact with her fingers , touching the moist , bulbous head with a sigh . “No
28538	28608	28533	28533	Maddie	855	” Sam grabbed her wrist so tight that it startled her . Peering up at his face , his expression stopped her from lowering her mouth to him . He looked panicked and anxious . The look only lasted a few heartbeats and then it was gone , followed by an expression of remorse . Loosening his hold on her wrist , he lowered his fiery body to hers , “
28624	28645	28614	28614	I	10	” His voice was frustrated . She pulled her wrist from his hand and wrapped her arms around his neck . “
28653	28691	28614	28614	I	10	” She wrapped her legs around his waist and pressed her breasts to his chest . She stroked her fingers over the rippling muscles of his back , down to his waist , and back up again . “Oh
28702	28710	28714	28714	Sam	785	” he groaned , his voice tortured . “I
28716	28725	28726	28726	He	785	”“I need you too , Sunshine . Now . ”
28737	28752	28726	28726	He	785	“ You ’re so fucking tight . I do n’t want to hurt you . ”
28777	28796	28797	28797	She	378	“Just fuck me , Sam . Now . Do n’t go easy or gentle . I need you . ”
28889	28900	28901	28901	he	785	“I’ve dreamed of this , Maddie . So many times , ”
28914	28924	28905	28905	he	785	“ It was never this good in my dreams . ”“Mine
28927	28943	28947	28947	Sam	785	” she panted , her legs wrapping tighter around his hips , begging for more . “
28956	29011	29015	29015	Sunshine	14	”Everything was raw and carnal , needy and desperate . Sam pummeled her with his cock , driving deeply , grasping her ass to bring them together again and again . The air was heavy around them , and their damp bodies slid together in an erotic glide as they reached for their peak . “Come
29029	29170	29021	29021	I	10	”His words sent her spinning over the edge , her climax roaring through her body like a violent storm . Holding on to Sam for dear life , her nails digging into his back , she exploded , crying out as her muscles spasmed , her release flooding over Sam ’s cock , bathing it with lush heat . Her back arched , her breasts abraded by the fine hairs on his chest , making her body tremble . Throwing her head back , she screamed his name as the whole world flew apart ; the only thing of any substance being the man she was clinging to , his muscular bulk preventing her from whirling into space . Sam followed her into release with an agonized groan , his warmth flooding her womb as his body shuddered over hers . “Fuck
29175	29191	29021	29021	I	10	” He collapsed on top of her , his chest heaving , his breathing ragged . “
29199	29257	29194	29194	I	10	” He rolled to his back beside her , pulling her against his side , wrapping his arms around her . They were silent as their heartbeats slowed and their bodies came down from their orgasmic high . Maddie rested her head on his chest , her body more sated and content than it had ever been . “We
29264	29273	29275	29275	you	10	” she finally mentioned in a remorseful voice . “I
29280	29324	29325	29325	I	10	” he said , his voice slightly hoarse . She had n’t read them yet , but it was n’t diseases she was worried about . He would n’t have given her his medical records to clear himself if everything was n’t negative . “
29332	29339	29330	29330	mine	10	” she replied with a sigh . “Then
29358	29365	29352	29352	I	10	” he answered , completely seriously . “
29382	29415	29416	29416	I	10	”She had to swallow the lump in her throat . She felt the same way . Living without Sam had been like living in the dark , waiting for daylight to come . “
29452	29458	29459	29459	he	383	sake!”“You’re marrying me , anyway , ”
29470	29478	29459	29459	he	383	“ You are marrying me , Maddie . ”
29507	29516	29490	29490	She	855	“ I said we ’d discuss it later . ”“It
29525	29530	29523	29523	mine	386	” he stated possessively . “We’ll
29533	29568	29569	29569	you	385	” she murmured , pulling him down for a tender kiss that quickly grew passionate . Kissing Sam was like putting a flame to gasoline , the ignition almost immediate and white - hot . “Are
29576	29586	29569	29569	you	385	” Sam demanded when he came up for air . “No
29602	29610	29591	29591	I	10	” she told him seductively , teasingly . “I
29618	29627	29612	29612	you	385	” he reminded her in a sultry voice . “I’m
29634	29647	29649	29649	I	10	” She ran the sole of her foot along his calf playfully . “I
29662	29670	29649	29649	I	10	” he answered in a husky voice . “Are
29683	29691	29693	29693	I	10	” She gave him a torrid look . “Damn
29696	29735	29736	29736	Sam	785	” he said aggressively , burying his fingers in her fiery , disheveled mane of hair . As he proceeded to master her with just one kiss , Maddie was fairly certain that he was correct . Chapter 8 “
29741	29762	29736	29736	Sam	785	” Kara squealed in delight as she hugged Maddie , her packing forgotten . Maddie hugged her friend in return . “
29782	29799	29802	29802	He	785	”Kara laughed lightly , sitting on the bed beside her suitcase , staring up at Maddie . “
29837	29926	29929	29929	he	389	”Maddie shared a knowing smile with Kara . After she and Sam had snuck back into the house and up the back stairs , they had separated , Sam explaining that he had some business with Simon before he and Kara left on their honeymoon . Maddie had quickly showered and come to say goodbye to Kara , and had promptly told her everything , desperately needing to talk to her friend about Sam . Kara was probably one of the few people who understood the Hudson men . “He
29945	29980	29929	29929	he	389	” Maddie replied , her heart sinking . The minute they had left the dock , she had felt Sam drawing away , the closeness they had found in each other ’s arms receding . “Maddie
30062	30069	30057	30057	Sam	785	” Kara said softly , thoughtfully . “
30086	30091	30092	30092	Maddie	855	do?”“I do n’t know , ”
30097	30140	30092	30092	Maddie	855	“ He ’s pushing and I need time . Hell , we do n’t even know each other anymore . Our relationship was years ago . We were barely adults . So much has happened since then . We ’ve both changed . ”“Uh
30158	30167	30142	30142	I	10	” Kara snickered . Maddie rolled her eyes . “
30176	30186	30196	30196	girlfriend	397	” She waved her hand at the open suitcase . “
30198	30210	30211	30211	Maddie	855	”Kara stood , her eyes soft and warm as she spoke . “
30245	30254	30255	30255	Maddie	855	”“I’m not sure he ’ll let me in , ”
30258	30274	30255	30255	Maddie	855	“ I do n’t really understand any of this . Everything is happening so fast . ”Kara
30287	30311	30255	30255	Maddie	855	“ I do n’t think so . I do n’t think Sam ever got over you . For him , it never ended . ”“I
30319	30412	30413	30413	him	399	” Maddie whispered , knowing what she said was true . Sam may have changed over the years , but he was still … Sam . She had been able to resist him when she thought he had cheated on her , when she had thought she had loved a man who had never existed . Now that she knew he had been trying to protect her , that he had wanted her , stopping herself from falling back into his spider web of sweltering heat and desperate need was nearly impossible . “Give
30436	30444	30425	30425	He	399	” Kara remarked , her voice pleading . “
30454	30457	30458	30458	I	10	”Maddie sighed . “
30475	30478	30458	30458	I	10	”Kara snorted . “
30504	30510	30511	30511	Maddie	855	”“You learned to manage Simon , ”
30517	30543	30544	30544	Kara	855	“He just lets me think I ’m managing him . I ’m really not . He pacifies me , but he ’s really quite devious , ”
30551	30565	30544	30544	Kara	855	“Do you ever get used to it ? Someone wanting you that much ? ”
30570	30596	30597	30597	Kara	855	“Oh yeah . It ’s completely addictive . What woman does n’t want to know that she ’s the center of her man ’s world ? ”
30601	30682	30597	30597	Kara	855	“ I went from being alone to being completely ecstatic . I ’ll take Simon ’s obsession any day compared to a man who does n’t give a shit . He loves me and his obsession makes me feel safe , protected , wanted . If some of the things he does are a little over the top , I do n’t care . It ’s actually pretty hot . All that matters is how much we love each other . ”Maddie
30731	30748	30753	30753	she	855	“ Maybe that ’s what bothers me . I could get addicted to him so easily . ”Kara
30758	30797	30753	30753	she	855	“ Then get addicted . Wallow in it . I doubt he ’s going to stop . Stubbornness is another Hudson trait . Once they decide they want , they do n’t stop even after they get it . ”Maddie
30813	30821	30822	30822	She	855	“ I ’m going to miss you . ”
30827	30831	30833	30833	Kara	855	“ Have fun . ”Simon
30872	30876	30877	30877	Kara	855	“I’ll call you . ”
30886	30906	30881	30881	she	855	“ I wo n’t be able to stand this cliffhanger . I ’ll need to know what ’s happening . ”“I
30925	30949	30919	30919	I	10	” Maddie said laughingly as she released her friend . Kara put her hands on her hips , shooting Maddie a disapproving look . “
30966	30990	30960	30960	You	409	”Unfortunately , Maddie knew she wanted to take Sam up on the entire deal . She just was n’t sure her heart would survive it.*****“If
30998	31013	31014	31014	I	10	”Sam stared at his brother , Simon , wishing it were just that easy . “
31025	31033	31034	31034	Simon	10	”“Uh … did you actually ask her ? ”
31038	31097	31098	31098	I	10	“Nope . I told her she was marrying me . She ’s had years to find somebody else and she has n’t . She ’s getting me . At least I wo n’t treat her like shit and I can give her everything she wants . She ’ll get over the fact that she hates me … eventually . ”
31127	31154	31155	31155	Simon	10	“Shit . At least I asked Kara to marry me . I was n’t planning on letting her refuse , but at least I did ask , ”
31166	31180	31181	31181	Sam	785	“I told her I wanted her to marry me . Same damn thing , ”
31188	31195	31196	31196	Simon	10	“Uh … not exactly , bro , ”
31199	31244	31196	31196	Simon	10	“ I do n’t think Maddie ’s the type of woman who wants to be told what to do . She ’s kind of like Kara in that way . You have to let Maddie think she ’s managing things once in a while . ”“Why
31246	31257	31263	31263	she	413	” Sam demanded , shooting his brother a disgusted look . “
31284	31288	31279	31279	She	413	”Simon nodded emphatically . “
31314	31359	31360	31361	Their mother	99	”“Oh , good grief . Am I really hearing my two sons discussing marriage as though they were arranging something in the Stone Age ? Samuel Hudson , you are going to court that woman appropriately and then politely ask her to marry you . ”
31424	31434	31416	31416	Mom	81	“ We were just discussing possible options , Mom . ”Helen
31479	31491	31492	31492	she	99	“You treat that woman right or you ’ll lose your chance , ”
31497	31512	31492	31492	she	99	“ I saw the way you were with her today . You need her . ”Sam
31558	31580	31581	31581	Helen	42	“And do n’t be sassy , Simon . You married a wonderful woman today . You need to treat her right , ”
31624	31631	31632	31632	Simon	10	“I treat Kara like a princess , ”
31642	31649	31632	31632	Simon	10	“You better continue to do it , ”
31756	31777	31752	31752	Helen	42	“ Did I … or did I not hear you say you were going to make that girl marry you , Samuel?”Dammit
31791	31798	31799	31799	he	422	“She ’s going to marry me , ”
31805	31855	31856	31856	Helen	42	“She ’s educated , she ’s smart and she ’s beautiful . Stop treating her like you have dominant caveman genes and maybe you ’ll succeed . You ca n’t just club the woman over the head and drag her away to your cave . She deserves your respect , ”
31860	31877	31878	31878	Sam	785	“I do respect her . I would n’t want to marry her if I did n’t , ”
31881	31892	31893	31893	Helen	42	“Then treat her well and stop acting like an ass , ”
31896	31911	31912	31912	she	42	“ I ’d like to see you as happy as Simon is , Sam , ”
31928	31936	31919	31919	She	42	“ You both deserve to be happy . ”Sam
31987	31991	31978	31978	He	422	“Are we ready ? ”
32029	32042	32015	32015	Simon	10	“ Yeah . I ’m ready , sweetheart . Let ’s go . ”Sam
32179	32195	32168	32168	Simon	10	“ I say stick with the plan . Use the club if you need to . ”Sam
33390	33407	33408	33408	she	855	“Shit . I would n’t want to be touched there either if someone had violated me , ”
34140	34144	34145	34146	The hostess	468	“Dr . Reynolds ? ”
34165	34166	34162	34162	she	468	“ Yes?”“Your
34179	34255	34258	34258	Maddie	855	” The tall brunette waited for Maddie to come up behind her and led her through the sophisticated restaurant to a quiet table in the corner . The décor was quietly elegant , finished mostly in black and white with modern but tasteful prints , one wall constructed entirely of glass to overlook the water . Max Hamilton rose as Maddie arrived at the table , a genuine smile on his lips as he said , “
34269	34321	34260	34260	I	10	”He was suave and elegant in a tan suit and navy and tan matching tie , every inch of him exuding power and control , but she had never sensed any harmful intentions behind his smile , and she still didn’t . He seated her before returning to his own chair . “
34329	34356	34260	34260	I	10	” he asked , summoning a waiter , and ordering a Scotch on the rocks for himself . Shrugging out of her coat , she answered , “
34372	34485	34260	34260	I	10	”Max placed an order for a glass of white Zinfandel as she accepted a menu from the waiter . He openly stared at her after the waiter left , his expression unreadable . Maddie looked at him with open fascination . What was it about this man that drew her , made her want to hug him until he did n’t feel so alone anymore ? Loneliness and sorrow seemed to hang over him like a dark cloud , even though she ’d mostly seen him smiling . She could sense both emotions , subliminal , yet heartbreaking . Tearing her eyes away from his face , she picked up her menu . “
34497	34500	34490	34490	I	10	”He grinned . “
34512	34519	34520	34520	she	471	”“I’m not exactly a picky eater , ”
34570	34580	34563	34563	they	472	“So tell me how you know Simon and Sam ? ”
34596	34620	34621	34621	He	619	“We’ve joined forces in ventures together for years . Sam has a knack for picking all the right ones . I just invest . ”
34635	34640	34641	34641	she	471	“That ’s not true , ”
34659	34675	34655	34655	He	619	“ I guess you really pay attention to the financial news . Probably watching Sam , ”
34703	34747	34697	34697	Max	619	“ I ’m not offended . Do n’t worry . It ’s obvious you and Sam have something going on . I like Sam . I ’m not even thinking of stepping on his toes . I just want to be … friends . ”
34814	34821	34822	34822	she	855	“Where are your parents , family ? ”
34835	34853	34854	34854	he	619	“I was an only child . And my parents died in a car accident ten years ago , ”
34908	34927	34929	34929	her	855	“ I had great parents . I was lucky , even though I lost them way too soon . ”She
34974	34987	34988	34988	Max	619	“You know Sam does n’t really sleep around , do n’t you ? ”
35014	35018	35019	35019	she	855	“ Excuse me ? ”
35036	35091	35092	35092	he	619	“ I ’m just saying … the stories about Sam for the most part are n’t true . He might take some of his female friends to parties , but he does n’t sleep with them like people think he does . He ’s gotten a bad reputation that he really does n’t deserve , ”
35102	35113	35114	35114	she	855	“And how would you know that it is n’t true ? ”
35125	35207	35208	35208	He	619	“Sam and I have known each other a long time . We go to a lot of the same functions , socialize in the same circles . Most of the time we go together . When my wife was alive , we would go with Sam and his female date for the evening . We ’d all go out for drinks together usually , but we dropped Sam ’s date off first , and then Sam . At home . Alone . ”
35216	35244	35208	35208	He	619	“ Now that my wife is gone , Sam and I drop his date first and then go hang out together . But we both leave alone . ”
35255	35256	35250	35250	he	619	“ Understand?”Maddie
35260	35284	35287	35287	he	619	“ So you ’re trying to tell me that he is n’t the man - whore he ’s made out to be by the press?”“I’m
35335	35379	35321	35321	Simon	10	” Max pulled out his credit card and speared it into the leather enclosed bill that had been brought discreetly to the table by the waiter . He dropped it onto the edge of the table and looked her directly in the eye . “
35424	35511	35420	35420	you	486	be?”I have n’t been with a woman in months . I fucking could n’t . Before that I only slept with women that had red hair , curvy bodies and who did n’t mind that I called out your name when I came . Women who only wanted money or material things because I had nothing else to give them . Oh , God . Sam had been telling the truth . Tearing her eyes away from Max , she stared at the wall behind him . “
35536	35539	35525	35525	she	67	Why?”Max shrugged . “
35592	35601	35589	35590	the man	67	” he said , his tone slightly bitter . “
35635	35648	35649	35649	she	67	”“But do n’t most men like having women fall all over them ? ”
35660	35684	35691	35691	Max	619	“It depends on the man , I guess . It gets pretty old and pretty unattractive after a while . And damn lonely . ”“Why
35693	35700	35691	35691	Max	619	” Maddie really wanted to know . “
35703	35710	35702	35702	you	492	matchmaking?”Max barked out a startled laugh . “
35764	35775	35755	35755	He	785	”“Well … he wo n’t hear about it from me . ”
35799	35810	35811	35811	He	619	“ No … but he ’ll hear it from them . ”
35842	35847	35848	35848	she	855	“Does Sam know them ? ”
35853	35869	35870	35870	Max	619	“Yeah . Pretty well . They work for him . Part of his security team , ”
35874	35887	35870	35870	Max	619	“ I ’ve seen them before . They ’re obviously your tail . ”“He
35893	35921	35922	35922	Maddie	855	” she answered , outraged that Sam would have her followed . Max reached his hand across the table and grabbed her arm before she could rise . “
36034	36051	36029	36029	He	785	” He held her hand across the table , keeping her seated , his voice calming . “
36089	36127	36078	36078	He	785	”Maddie was n’t sure how she felt about Sam knowing her every move . It was a little uncomfortable . Yeah , she understood his protective streak , but having someone on her tail constantly was disconcerting . “
36135	36148	36131	36131	he	785	” she asked , not sure if she had heard Max properly . “Flu
36156	36168	36150	36150	He	785	” Max shook his head , looking concerned for his friend . “
36187	36188	36185	36185	David	20	“ “
36204	36217	36201	36202	Stubborn man	506	” she said , squeezing Max ’s hand while she stood up . “
36228	36238	36201	36202	Stubborn man	506	”Max chuckled as he released her hand and stood . “
36247	36275	36276	36276	Maddie	855	” He pulled a gold pen from his pocket and signed the credit card receipt that the waiter had dropped on their table and pocketed his card . “
36288	36316	36317	36317	I	10	”Maddie shoved her arms into the jacket that Max was politely holding out for her . She buttoned the jacket and propped her hands on her hips . “
36338	36350	36329	36329	I	10	”Max held out his arm to her and she took it . “
36369	36377	36378	36378	she	507	”“Great . And who ’s protecting him ? ”
36383	36393	36394	36394	Max	619	“I doubt anyone has ever thought he needed it , ”
36398	36413	36414	36414	she	507	“He does , dammit . He does n’t need to always be the protector , ”
36431	36437	36444	36444	he	824	“ Everyone needs support sometimes . ”Max
36453	36471	36444	36444	he	824	“ You know , I do believe you ’re right . Take care of him , Maddie . ”Giving
36515	36519	36520	36520	Max	619	“I’ll call you . ”
36532	36537	36538	36538	she	507	“Talk to you soon , ”
36557	36564	36565	36565	Max	619	“Don’t let Sam boss you around , ”
36579	36598	36599	36599	she	507	“ Not happening or I ’ll find a reason why he suddenly needs a shot in the ass , ”
36713	36715	36704	36704	he	785	“Fuck ! ”
36818	36839	36808	36808	he	785	“I do n’t care if he is n’t seeing anyone . He ’s seeing me . I ’m his doctor . ”Maddie
36932	36948	36915	36915	He	785	“ Get your fucking hands off her . And do n’t ever touch her again . ”
36972	37000	36961	36962	The guards	861	“ Sorry , Mr. Hudson . She broke away at the door and we could n’t catch her . You said you were n’t to be disturbed . ”“She
37007	37011	36961	36962	The guards	861	” he grunted . “
37015	37063	36961	36962	The guards	861	”The guards left , leaving Maddie standing by the door . She closed the door and came to the side of the bed , one hand on her hip . She placed a cool hand on his forehead gently , smoothing the damp hair from his face . “
37082	37092	37093	37093	he	521	anything?”“Don’t need pills . I ’ll get over it , ”
37119	37132	37110	37110	Sam	785	“ What the hell ! Do n’t you have anything except condoms in here?”Sam
37159	37172	37156	37156	he	521	“ No . I do n’t take pills . Never need them . ”She
37267	37287	37288	37288	she	522	“You need clean sheets and fluids . Can you manage to get in the shower if I help you ? ”
37310	37326	37307	37307	He	525	“ You know , this bossy doctor thing is pretty hot . Will you scrub my back?”“If
37329	37401	37307	37307	He	525	” she snipped back at him as she started stripping the sheets from his sweat - ridden body . Not wanting her to see his weakness , Sam made a superhuman effort to sit up . He made it , but he swayed as he got to his feet and started coughing so hard he could n’t stop . She propped him up with her body , which was surprisingly strong . “
37425	37455	37307	37307	He	525	” she commented , sounding like a cat that was spitting mad . Holy hell , she was completely hot when she was in a take - charge mood . “
37474	37492	37469	37469	You	528	” His gut rolled at the thought of Maddie feeling as miserable as he did right now . “I’m
37509	37515	37504	37504	you	528	” she asked , exasperated . “
37531	37541	37542	37542	he	785	”“Don’t ask for help . I help other people , ”
37603	37618	37582	37582	She	99	“ Will you be okay while I go find some fresh sheets and change the bed?”“Yeah
37620	37633	37582	37582	She	99	” he said , squawking as the lukewarm water hit his body . “Don’t
37645	37728	37639	37639	You	528	” she warned him , giving him a commanding look . Really , the woman was completely sexy in her doctor mode . A feisty redheaded virago who he wished he could tame right about now . Unfortunately , he was n’t in any position to drag her into the cubicle and take her against the shower stall . Damn … he wished he was . He ’d like nothing better than to tap all of that passion she had right now . “
37733	37788	37639	37639	You	528	” he asked , wondering why she was dressed in a soft gray angora sweater dress , a color that just made her hair look more fiery and hugged the curves of her body like a lover . It probably was n’t made to be sexy , but on her , it definitely was . “I
37798	38350	38352	38352	David	20	” She pulled off her heels as she left the bathroom , leaving the door open . With who?He wanted to know , but Maddie had left like her ass was on fire . He let the water pour onto his body , rinsing the perspiration from his skin . He eyed the water temperature , tempted to ignore her and make it hotter , but his woman was likely to kick his ass right now . Problem was , she probably could . He smiled as he leaned into the water , letting it cleanse him . He wanted to really wash , but he was drained , using all of his energy just to stand under the water . Maddie came back five minutes later . He watched , completely mesmerized , as she efficiently stripped every article of clothing from her body , leaving them in a heap on the floor . It was n’t a strip tease , but then Maddie only needed to exist for him to get aroused , and watching her disrobe had his cock hard and ready for action . Unfortunately , the rest of his body wasn’t . Grabbing a washrag from the vanity , she entered the shower , shivering at the water temperature for a moment before getting to work . She lathered the washrag with soap and started running it over his skin , the linen gliding over him with her gentle touch . She hesitated when she reached his groin and his whole body froze . He forcefully slammed down the instinct to stop her . This was Maddie , trying to help him . He was not pushing her away . He did n’t want to push her away . Maddie dropped the cloth , and Sam felt only her gentle hands on him as she moved over his groin and stroked his pulsating cock with her bare fingers . The sensation caused an initial startled reaction , but he kept his eyes on Maddie as she touched him , focusing only on her . Almost disappointed when she did n’t linger there for long , he felt her hands move oh - so - tenderly over his ass . His butt cheeks tightened and he ground his teeth as she stroked between the globes of his ass , her fingers lightly going over his anus . He released a tormented growl , one part fear … but another part pleasure . Her touch was clinical , but achingly soft , enticingly delicate . Crouching , she ran the soap over both of his legs . Then , she stood and washed his hair , her touch soothing as she gently massaged his scalp . After picking up the handheld showerhead attachment , she briskly rinsed both his hair and body , and turned off the shower . She dried herself roughly and hurriedly , but picked up another towel and sweetly caressed him with it , patting him dry . After quickly pulling a short , cotton nightgown over her head from the pile of clothes she had left on the vanity , she braced his body and brought him out to sit on the bed , helping him into a fresh pair of boxer briefs . “Wow
38356	38396	38352	38352	David	20	” she marveled as she picked up the juice from the bedside table and handed it to him . She shook pills from various bottles and held them to his mouth like she would do with a recalcitrant child . “
38409	38416	38417	38417	he	20	”“I pay him to be efficient , ”
38449	38479	38480	38480	She	538	“Finish the drink . You need to keep hydrated . I just gave you something for your fever , congestion , cough and pain . You ’ll probably sleep . ”
38510	38516	38504	38504	Maddie	855	“ Lay back and rest . ”“Stay
38520	38549	38551	38551	I	10	” Sam asked , not able to help himself . He did n’t give a shit if he sounded pathetic , his need for Maddie overcoming his pride . “Of
38555	38572	38573	38575	stubborn men ”	1100	” she replied indignantly . Sam smiled as she launched into a tirade that included stuff about “
38575	38816	38573	38575	stubborn men ”	1100	” and other derogatory oaths about the male gender , and him in particular . His woman was angry at him for not taking care of himself . Somehow … the curses did n’t bother him at all … they made his chest ache with tenderness for the only woman who had cared for him , cared about him , other than his mother . He propped himself on a pillow , watching his fiery female stomp around the room , picking up clothes and straightening things he had discarded when he ’d gotten ill and never picked up . She mumbled under her breath , but Sam had no doubt it was more of the same diatribe , so maybe he was glad he could n’t hear her . Instead , he drank in the sight of her , somehow feeling better just by watching her . Showering had helped . He felt clean for the first time in days , and comfortable in fresh sheets . His headache was slowly easing and lethargy was claiming his body instead of misery . His cock was as hard as a rock and it stiffened even more as she bent over , revealing her delectable ass . He gaped , unable to do anything else , leering at her bare backside as she bent to pick up her shoes . She turned as she straightened , shooting him an admonishing look . “
38828	38904	38824	38824	I	10	” she mumbled . Oh , hell no you do n’t . He nearly groaned with disappointment as she ducked into the bathroom , obviously to find a pair of underwear in the new clothes he had bought her that she had n’t taken home with her . After returning from the bathroom , she picked up a thermometer from the plethora of items that David had dropped off and popped it into his mouth . “
38909	38967	38824	38824	I	10	” she warned him , her brow arched . He scowled and crossed his arms in front of him . Damned if he did n’t want to pull the annoying thing out of his mouth just to be contrary . Then she laughed , a light , amused sound that flowed over him like a healing balm . “
38976	38997	38968	38968	You	540	” she chortled , putting her hand on his forehead . The beep sounded and she removed the offending thermometer . “
39000	39004	38968	38968	You	540	” she mused . “
39029	39060	39015	39015	I	10	”He frowned as she handed him more juice . The last thing he really wanted was to swallow . His throat felt like it had been worked over with sandpaper . “Drink
39067	39107	39108	39108	Anybody	534	” She answered as though she already knew what he was thinking . He eyed her as he sipped the juice , watching the beautiful vixen shake medication from the bottles at the bedside , probably for later dosages . “
39119	39167	39115	39117	a bossy doctor	543	” he asked dryly , handing the empty glass back to her . Had anybody ever told her how hot she looked when she was pissed off?Sitting the cup on the table , she folded her arms in front of her and gave him a chastising look . “
39193	39202	39203	39203	you	540	” she answered in a pseudo sugary voice . “Think
39208	39218	39203	39203	you	540	” he admitted in a low , husky voice . “
39225	39247	39203	39203	you	540	” he questioned , scowling as he noticed a small bruise on her left temple that he had n’t noticed earlier . “It
39262	39326	39256	39256	I	10	” She slipped into the bed and pulled the covers over herself . She turned off the light at the bedside , plunging the room into darkness . He lunged for her , pulling her back against him . Christ , she feels good . He pulled her back against his chest and buried his face in her wild tangle of silky hair . “
39357	39379	39351	39352	Those agents	546	” he growled , shuddering at the thought that Maddie had been involved in an accident and he had n’t known . “You
39457	39492	39453	39453	I	10	” she answered , sounding exasperated . Sam ’s heart was beating so fast he could n’t catch his breath . Fuck ! He clutched Maddie tighter , running his hands over her body . “
39503	39525	39526	39526	I	10	” he asked , panicked at the thought . Maddie rolled to face him , putting her arms around his neck . “
39583	39595	39596	39596	he	785	”“You need a bigger vehicle , something safer . And newer , ”
39608	39610	39611	39611	she	555	“Sleep , ”
39674	39681	39682	39682	he	785	“ Something bad could have happened , ”
39687	39691	39692	39692	Maddie	855	“It did n’t , ”
39721	39748	39697	39697	her	855	“ Please rest , Sam . I ’m worried about you . You obviously have a bad case of the flu and you need to sleep . ”His
39812	39822	39823	39823	he	785	“ I ’m glad you ’re here , Sunshine , ”
39834	39841	39842	39842	she	855	“Call me next time , please , ”
39846	39861	39862	39862	he	785	“Nothing can happen to you , Maddie . I would n’t live through it , ”
39912	39917	39918	39918	she	855	“I’m here , Sam , ”
39922	39926	39927	39927	he	785	God!“You’re marrying me , ”
40212	40224	40225	40225	he	785	“You’re driving the new car . Period . End of discussion , ”
40247	40307	40308	40308	she	855	“ Fine . If the discussion is over , I ’m leaving . And you can take the car and shove it up your ass because I ’m not driving it . You had no right to select a vehicle for me without asking and then demand I drive it . I ’m not one of your damn employees . ”Wishing
40472	40497	40498	40498	he	785	“I know you ’re not one of my damn employees . If you were , you ’d do what I tell you to do , ”
40501	40515	40498	40498	he	785	“ And if you walk out that door , I ’ll catch you . ”Folding
40528	40543	40544	40544	she	855	“ Then what ? How do you plan on forcing me to drive it ? ”
40556	40600	40544	40544	she	855	“ Damn it ! You did n’t even ask me if I liked it , if I wanted it . My opinion does n’t matter , as long as I do as you say . What the hell is wrong with you tonight ? ”
40666	40672	40673	40673	he	785	“ You ’re not leaving , ”
40677	40681	40673	40673	he	785	“ Why are you crying?”Maddie
40784	40792	40770	40770	She	855	“ Please , just let me go . ”“Tell
40833	40876	40882	40882	Sam	785	” He was panting , his breath warm against her ear . Shit . He was softening , acting like her Sam again . Here I go , up the roller coaster incline , wondering when I ’m going to plummet again . “I
40886	40927	40929	40929	I	10	” Her emotions were a jumbled mess , old baggage coming back to haunt her . She could n’t help it . Sam was so necessary to her happiness that it scared her when he became so icy and brittle . “What
40937	40945	40946	40946	I	10	” His voice was tender , emotional . “
40951	40969	40970	40970	she	570	”“When you ’re cold and distant , I get afraid that you do n’t want me anymore , ”
40988	41033	41038	41038	she	570	“ I know it ’s old baggage , and I know I ’m probably needier than most women when it comes to you , but I have to know that I ’m important to you , that my opinions matter . That I matter . ”
41049	41065	41067	41067	his	8	“ When you distance yourself emotionally from me , acting cold , I get scared . ”Sam
41084	41094	41095	41095	he	8	“ I ’m sorry , sweetheart . So sorry , ”
41109	41145	41095	41095	he	8	“ I get scared , too . I ’m afraid something will happen to you and I wo n’t be worth a shit if it does . Do n’t you understand how important you are to me?”Maddie
41226	41260	41261	41261	He	8	“ I need you , Maddie . So much that it terrifies me . I guess sometimes I ’m afraid to need someone so damn much that my whole life depends on it . ”
41274	41313	41314	41314	She	570	“I need you too , Sam . So much . I ca n’t stand it when you ’re cold and remote . It brings back all of my past , all of the times that nobody wanted me . ”
41335	41337	41338	41338	He	8	“Fuck ! ”
41348	41402	41338	41338	He	8	“ Sunshine , sometimes I forget that you have your own insecurities . I was a selfish prick . I was only thinking about protecting myself . Forgive me . Please . I ’ll try to never do it again . I promise . But I do n’t think I can stop worrying . ”
41421	41434	41435	41435	she	570	“I want you exactly as you are , minus the frigid stuff , ”
41470	41477	41478	41478	he	785	“What if it ’s too hot ? ”
41512	41519	41520	41520	she	570	“ Then I ’ll happily burn , ”
41745	41758	41718	41718	She	570	“ Please , Sam . I need to feel you inside me . ”
41872	41876	41877	41877	he	785	“ Ride me , ”
41901	41909	41910	41910	she	570	“ It might stain your nice suit , ”
41945	41981	41982	41982	he	785	“Then it will become my favorite goddamn suit . I ’ll get it cleaned and wear it every day , remembering what it felt like to fuck you in it . Come here . Now , ”
42100	42113	42114	42114	His	785	“Christ ! You ’re so fucking wet . Hot . For me . ”
42124	42128	42129	42129	she	570	“I need you , ”
42267	42269	42270	42270	she	570	“Ahh … ”
42303	42305	42306	42306	Sam	785	“Fuck ! ”
42317	42326	42327	42327	he	785	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m sorry , ”
42336	42342	42327	42327	he	785	“What ? What is it ? ”
42374	42379	42380	42380	he	785	“ I ’m sorry , ”
42384	42400	42380	42380	he	785	“ I do n’t do that . I should n’t have violated you that way . ”
42459	42476	42447	42447	He	785	“ Sam , you did n’t hurt me . It felt good . It was hot . ”“I
42487	42500	42501	42501	I	10	” He shook his head , perspiration still dripping from his face . “
42518	42530	42515	42515	I	10	”Grasping his face , she forced his eyes to meet hers . “
42571	42580	42569	42569	Me	10	” She stared at him with adoring eyes . “You
42585	42603	42569	42569	Me	10	” he asked , his voice astonished . He searched her face , looking for the truth . “Yes
42618	42628	42605	42605	You	579	” she answered , her voice sultry and needy . “
42635	42654	42631	42631	I	10	” She wanted to take away the remorseful look from his face and replace it with desire again . “I
42665	42796	42661	42661	Maddie	855	” he rasped , his voice desperate . She lifted her ass and he grasped his engorged member . They groaned together as his cock slid into her channel . Inching herself down onto him , she clenched his shoulders , her muscles stretching to accept him , panting as he exquisitely filled her to capacity , almost , but not quite , to the border of discomfort . He fisted his hands at her hips , his jaw clenched , his whole expression feral and covetous . Sam looked beautiful in that moment , his desire and possessiveness so close to the surface , his powerful body tense with carnal desire . Maddie gasped as he thrust upward , burying himself as deeply inside her as he possibly could . “
42799	42862	42661	42661	Maddie	855	” she hissed , panting , the air around them humid , heavy and scented with equal parts desire and need . Her inner muscles clenched around his pulsating cock , her entire body trembling . His eyes held hers , their gazes locking as he controlled his thrusts , the movement of his cock in and out of her tight cavern . “I
42888	42902	42883	42883	I	10	” he whispered huskily . Maddie felt like she was about to incinerate . “
42929	42998	42999	42999	you	580	” She moaned as he stroked harder , the curve of her ass and upper thighs being caressed by the elegant fabric of his pants with every pump of his hips . Her clit rode his open zipper , the teasing friction sending her reeling . Maddie gave herself over to Sam , completely lost to sensation as she closed her eyes and tipped her head back helplessly . “Need
43007	43020	43003	43003	I	10	” he growled , one of his hands sliding over her ass . “
43033	43072	43003	43003	I	10	” His thumb slid back into her anus , the area already wet with her juices . He stroked in and out of that tight hole gently while he rocked her channel with pummeling thrusts of his cock . “Oh
43079	43101	43003	43003	I	10	” Her pussy clenched around his cock , milking him with her spasms . She keened as tremors shook her body . “Come
43107	43213	43105	43105	Maddie	855	” he growled , grasping the back of her neck and pulling her mouth roughly to his , spearing between her lips with his marauding tongue , deeply inside her in every way possible . Even though she was supposed to be riding him , Sam continued to master her , demanding , insisting , and dominating . The only thing she could do was lower herself down to meet his frantic , deep thrusts … and come . Ripping her mouth from his , she screamed , her climax tearing through her body like a turbulent storm , leaving her helpless in the aftermath . “Fuck
43219	43294	43295	43295	You	582	” Sam groaned , slamming into her hard as his cock pulsated , releasing himself deeply into her womb , his thumb still stroking gently in and out of her ass unconsciously as he shuddered from his explosive release . Sam twisted , pulling his hands away from her hips and ass . He collapsed on the couch , keeping her body on top of his by wrapping his arms tightly around her waist . “
43302	43334	43335	43335	I	10	” he rasped , belying the harshness of his words by kissing her forehead , her temple , her cheeks , and finally laying a tender kiss on her swollen lips . “
43344	43355	43339	43339	I	10	”Maddie did n’t have to ask him what he meant . “
43395	43406	43407	43407	he	785	”“I do n’t have any control with you , Sunshine , ”
43411	43423	43424	43424	she	10	“I know . And I love the way you want me , ”
43434	43455	43456	43456	he	785	“Do you , Maddie ? Does it ever frighten you ? Cause sometimes it scares the hell out of me , ”
43465	43510	43511	43511	she	10	“No , Sam . I could never be afraid of you . You might piss me off , but the way you want me makes me so hot that I ca n’t resist you . I want you as much as you want me , ”
43528	43534	43535	43535	he	785	“ Not possible , sweetheart , ”
43546	43557	43558	43558	she	10	“So you ’d rather have control ? Fuck without passion ? ”
43562	43585	43586	43586	he	785	“Hell no . I did n’t say I did n’t want it . I just said it can be a little uncomfortable , ”
43602	43610	43611	43611	she	10	“ We ’ll get used to it , ”
43614	43640	43611	43611	she	10	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m laying here stark naked while you look like you ’re ready to go out and dominate the world . ”“You
43652	43656	43647	43647	We	585	” he grumbled . “
43668	43680	43681	43681	I	10	”His husky , possessive voice sent a shiver down her spine . “
43710	43717	43718	43718	he	785	car?”“What do you want to do ? ”
43727	43791	43792	43792	He	785	“ I want you to have it . It was meant as a gift and I did n’t mean to be an ass . It ’s big , it ’s sturdy and it has every safety feature known to man . I ’d like you to have it because I worry about you being safe . Nothing can happen to you , Sunshine . ”
43818	43845	43846	43846	she	855	“ Okay . I ’ll drive it . See how easy that was ? You ask kindly and I respond the way you want me to , ”
43852	43861	43862	43862	he	785	“Are you trying to train me , woman ? ”
43872	43876	43866	43866	Maddie	855	“ Is that even possible?”“Nope
43888	43918	43879	43879	I	10	” he rasped , his hands continuing to stroke her back and her curls lovingly , possessively . Lifting her head , she speared him with an amused glare . “
43928	43935	43936	43936	he	785	caveman?”“That ’s what my mother said , ”
43946	43952	43941	43941	Maddie	855	“ She said you were a caveman?”“Yeah
43963	43968	43970	43970	Sam	785	” he replied indignantly . “Oh
43977	43985	43970	43970	Sam	785	” Maddie laughed so hard she snorted . “I
43992	43996	43997	43997	we	587	” he argued . “After
44002	44018	43997	43997	we	587	” she reminded him , her eyebrows drawing together , daring him to deny it . “Then
44038	44059	44061	44061	me	10	” he asked in a disgruntled voice . Maddie stirred , sliding off his body reluctantly and standing beside him . “
44067	44080	44061	44061	me	10	” she offered , shooting him her best come - hither look . “
44101	44132	44133	44133	I	10	”He came to his feet quickly , grabbing a throw from the back of the couch and covering her before he swept her off her feet and into his arms . “
44153	44188	44152	44152	you	785	agree?”Oh , Lord . Maddie shook her head with a smile . Maybe that was n’t such a good plan after all . He could probably get her to agree to just about anything . “
44191	44222	44152	44152	you	785	” she said reluctantly , knowing she ’d probably regret it . Sam grinned , a wicked smile that made his handsome face so sexy that her pussy flooded again . “I
44235	44245	44246	44246	I	10	” His naughty low voice was sinful and delicious . “
44256	44266	44246	44246	I	10	”Her heart palpitated as she met his emerald gaze . “
44274	44283	44267	44267	I	10	” Releasing a beleaguered breath , she smiled . “I’ll
44290	44329	44330	44330	I	10	” He shot her an arrogant , scorching look . Truth was , he probably would , and she would love every moment of it . She nipped at his earlobe and then soothed it with her tongue . “
44342	44355	44357	44357	Maddie	855	” she whispered in a fuck - me voice beside his ear . “Goddammit
44369	44374	44375	44375	You	785	” he replied hoarsely . “
44381	44413	44414	44414	I	10	”He strode out of the room , and through the house , taking the steps so fast she was bouncing in his arms , laughing as he rocketed to his bedroom . “
44425	44429	44414	44414	I	10	” she murmured . “Still
44433	44451	44453	44453	you	785	” he grunted . He dropped her gently on the bed and started tearing at his clothes . “
44460	44596	44597	44597	me	10	” he demanded , popping the buttons on his shirt as he removed it . Maddie sighed dreamily as she watched Sam frantically removing his clothes , revealing every bit of his masculine perfection . Someday he ’ll actually ask me to marry him . She already knew she would say yes . If she was n’t sure , she would n’t be having unprotected sex with him . She had started on birth control , but things were still a little risky , just like the man coming toward her could be a little dangerous . Gloriously naked , he stalked her by crawling over the bed . He pulled the blanket from her body , uncovering her like he was unwrapping a present , a look of complete fascination on his gorgeous face . “Give
44611	45399	45400	45401	an escort	592	” he growled , covering her body with his and pinning her hands over her head . Maddie melted as his scorching skin met hers , the relief of skin to skin contact making her ignore his comment . His icy behavior hurt her , but her alpha male drove her mad , his dominant behavior making her crazy to have him inside her . Knowing she would never tame Sam and that she did n’t really want to , she met his demanding mouth as it covered hers , losing herself to the man who owned her heart , body and soul … and always had . Chapter 12 Two nights later , Maddie sat sipping champagne in one of the most elegant ballrooms in the city , trying desperately not to look bored . The only thing keeping her mind from going completely numb was watching Sam in his element , charming and urbane , smooth and sexy , and completely hot . Hiding her smile in an elegant flute glass , she stared at him unabashedly , still trying to accept the fact that he really wanted her , needed her . She had already known that Sam could do a tuxedo with style , but she could n’t help but notice that he was completely comfortable in this elegant setting , a flashy charity function that he ’d ask her attend with him . In her standard little black cocktail dress and high heels , she was feeling incredibly underdressed , like a fish out of water . She was pretty certain that every woman here had a custom gown with an expensive designer label , and that not one wore costume jewelry . But Sam was completely sincere when he said I looked absolutely gorgeous . He ’s the only one that matters . She sighed as Sam flashed his charming smile at an elderly woman , a flirty and charismatic smile that had the poor woman blushing like a teenager . Yeah , Sam loved women of all ages , and Maddie could tell they were completely enchanted with him . Strangely enough , she was n’t jealous . The man she was watching was only a very small part of the man she knew , the face of Hudson Corporation , the public Sam Hudson , elegant billionaire . But he ’s so much … more . Maddie held that information close to her chest , loving the fact that she knew the real Sam Hudson , and he was a scorching hot alpha male with a tender side that melted her heart until she could do nothing but accept that she loved him . Always had . Always would . For her , there was only Sam . That basic and elemental connection had cemented when they had met , and she had never been able to release the bond . She accepted the fact that Sam was her one and only , that there had only ever been one man for her in this lifetime . Sure , it was frightening , but it was also exhilarating to find him again , to discover that he had been missing her as much as she had missed him all these years . I just wish I had known the truth earlier . I wish I had known how much he had suffered in his past . Maddie released a tremulous breath , grateful for second chances . How close she and Sam had come to never being together again ! She was a woman of science , but she had to admit that sometimes fate and destiny could n’t be completely denied . Sam ’s eyes scanned the room , as though looking for her . Their gazes connected and locked , and he gave her a heated look , a glance that she knew was reserved only for her . Her breath hitched as he stared openly , possessively , his look telling her exactly what he was thinking . The silent communication flowed between them , the heat almost so unbearable that Maddie needed a cold shower . I was supposed to go to the ladies ’ room . He wants to know why I ’m standing here alone watching him . Actually , she had been on her way to the restroom , but she ’d stopped to get a drink and then had gotten mesmerized by watching her ultra - hot man lay on the charm with every person around him . Giving him a small smile , she raised her glass to him and turned to go up the long staircase to the restroom . “Need
45403	45421	45422	45422	Max	619	” A low , friendly voice sounded beside her ear . Maddie stopped on the first step . “
45424	45445	45422	45422	Max	619	” she answered , happy to see his smiling face . Unable to stop herself , she hugged him lightly . “
45453	45554	45422	45422	Max	619	”He hugged her back and offered his arm with a delighted smile and Maddie took it graciously . God , he looked good . There was n’t a single spark of chemistry between them , but there was something about him that tugged at her heart . Aesthetically , she could look at him and appreciate how handsome he was and how well he sported his own black tuxedo . He was such a gorgeous guy , and so incredibly sweet . Still , he did n’t appear to have a date . Maybe it was too soon for him . “Having
45557	45569	45620	45620	She	855	” Max asked her as he guided her up the stairs . “Not
45572	45577	45578	45578	I	10	” she answered honestly . “
45592	45595	45596	45596	he	785	”“Do what ? ”
45627	45634	45635	45635	She	855	“ This . All of this . ”
45642	45652	45653	45653	she	855	“ I guess I ’m not exactly a socialite , ”
45657	45673	45674	45674	She	855	“ The only good thing about it is seeing all the handsome men in tuxedos . ”
45680	45684	45685	45685	he	785	“One in particular , ”
45690	45713	45716	45716	he	785	“ I saw the way you were looking at Sam . I doubt you knew there was another male in the room . ”
45719	45741	45742	45742	He	785	“ You look happy . Even if you are a little bored . You get used to it after a while . ”
45745	45764	45742	45742	He	785	“ It ’s pretty much an obligation that comes with the money . It ’s a fair trade . ”Maddie
45810	45828	45802	45802	she	855	“I’ll catch up with you later , Maddie . I need to talk to you about something , ”
46139	46179	46120	46120	she	855	“I know you ’ve been calling her . That you took her to dinner . I want you to leave her the fuck alone . She belongs with me . She always has . I need her , dammit , ”
46189	46196	46197	46197	Max	619	“I want to be her friend , ”
46204	46250	46251	46251	Sam	785	“You want to fuck her . You have a thing for her and I do n’t blame you . But Maddie is mine . She was always meant to be mine . I ca n’t fucking live without her . So find yourself another woman , ”
46255	46263	46264	46264	Max	619	“I do n’t want to fuck her , ”
46315	46327	46328	46328	Sam	785	“You want her in your bed and it is n’t happening , ”
46331	46360	46361	46361	Max	619	“Oh , for Christ ’s sake , Sam . Pull your head out of your ass for a minute and listen . I ’m not into fucking incest . ”
46374	46384	46371	46371	he	619	“ Maddie is my sister . My blood relative . ”Sam
46446	46533	46434	46434	Max	619	“ We were separated . I was adopted , she was n’t . I did n’t even know about her until I saw her at the wedding . She ’s the image of our real mother . And she and I have the same fucking eyes . After I looked more into my adoption records , I found out she was my sister . I was going to tell her . I just have n’t had a chance . I really wanted to tell her first . ”Maddie
46938	46942	46943	46943	Maddie	855	“Sam ! Sam ! ”
47011	47019	47007	47007	him	785	“Maddie ! Sam ! Are you okay ? ”
47070	47105	47067	47067	she	614	“ I ’m okay . I do n’t know about Sam . He ’s not moving . I ’m scared to move him . I do n’t know what kind of injuries he has . ”She
47152	47164	47165	47165	she	614	“Oh , God . Sam , talk to me . Please , ”
47191	47208	47209	47209	I	10	“ I love you . I love you so much . Please be okay . Please . ”“Maybe
47219	47270	47209	47209	I	10	” His voice was a husky rasp , barely audible , his warm breath caressing her ear , his mouth resting right next to her temple . Oh , Jesus , he ’s alive . Maddie ’s heart slammed against her chest wall , beating so rapidly she was lightheaded . “
47285	47290	47275	47275	I	10	” she whispered back . “Ambulance
47296	47306	47275	47275	I	10	” Max said urgently , trying to reassure her . “He
47310	47346	47359	47359	sweetheart	10	” she answered , her eyes meeting those of her newly - discovered brother , eyes so much like her own . Sam started to stir , groaning as he tried to move off her . “I
47352	47357	47359	47359	sweetheart	10	” she demanded sternly . “God
47373	47382	47370	47370	you	10	” he told her , his voice groggy . “
47388	47395	47396	47396	she	10	”“I do n’t care . Stay , ”
47399	47402	47403	47403	you	10	“ Wait . ”“Will
47411	47447	47403	47403	you	10	” he asked , levering some of his weight from her with his forearms . Holding him in place by pulling her arms from her cocoon and wrapping them around his body , she exclaimed , “
47472	47484	47485	47485	he	785	”“Sunshine , I ’ll stay here forever just to hear that , ”
47491	47493	47494	47494	she	625	“ Marry me?”If
47542	47544	47545	47545	she	625	“Yes , ”
47549	47557	47558	47558	you	10	“ I always planned on saying yes . ”“Knew
47563	47569	47558	47558	you	10	” he mumbled , disgruntled . “I
47574	47595	47558	47558	you	10	” she informed him tenderly , her hand lightly stroking his hair , her relief in hearing him speak overwhelming . “You
47600	47697	47702	47702	Max	619	” he grumbled . In that moment , Maddie knew Sam was back . Tears leaked from her eyes and rolled unchecked down her cheeks as her hands clutched him close , trying to keep him safe until the ambulance arrived . Max ’s gaze stayed locked with hers , comforting her silently , his eyes trying to tell her everything would be okay . His hand covered hers , warm and gentle , steadying her as she continued to hold on to Sam . They stayed just like that until the paramedics arrived . Chapter 13 “
47710	47905	47705	47705	you	619	” Maddie questioned Max in a tremulous voice . Sam had been taken to Radiology to clear him of any spinal injuries , while Max and Maddie waited alone in an exam room in the Emergency Department , sitting side by side , their hands clasped together . Her hand trembled slightly , the events of the entire evening getting to her . It was so fantastical … yet , even before she asked Max the question , she knew it was true . She felt in her gut , in her soul . Max Hamilton really was her brother . Maddie glanced up at him and smiled . Max was right . They did have the same eyes , an unusual hazel that had a sunburst gold pattern around the pupil surrounded by an iris of greenish brown . When she had first met Sam , he had called her Sunshine because of her eyes , saying that the pattern around her pupil reminded him of the sun . Later , he said he called her that because she was the light in his life . Max squeezed her hand a little tighter . “
47943	47977	47928	47928	I	10	” Pulling his hand from hers , he dug his wallet from his pocket and sifted through it , extracting an old photo , a small picture resembling an old high school photo . “
47984	47994	47980	47982	our real mother	99	” he explained , handing the photo to Maddie . “
48010	48046	48048	48048	she	99	”She took the photo , examining the youthful face and carefree smile . The woman did look like her , with flaming red curls and hazel eyes , her features very similar to her own . “
48052	48057	48048	48048	she	99	” she asked curiously . “
48061	48070	48059	48059	you	627	her?”Max ran a frustrated hand through his hair . “
48095	48284	48285	48285	I	10	”Maddie had never known the woman . Still , she felt a sense of loss . Maybe she had always hoped that someday her real mother would find her , that the woman who had given birth to her had actually wanted her , but had had to give her up . Admitting to herself that she had probably hoped for that rose - tinted scenario , Maddie knew it was the reason why she had never really dug much into her records or tried to look for her birth mother . If she did n’t know the truth … there was always hope , right ? In her youth , the illusion that her mother would look for her eventually had carried Maddie through foster home after foster home , desperately clinging to the hope that her parents had actually wanted her but could n’t keep her , that they had actually loved her . Later , she had simply no longer wanted to know the truth , her heart battered and bruised from too much rejection and hurt . Fingering the picture , Maddie answered softly , “
48322	48333	48310	48310	they	359	” she mused , staring at her mother ’s photo . “
48340	48377	48378	48378	They	359	” Maddie questioned , ready to hear the answers . She had Sam now … and Max . Whatever was in the past would n’t hurt anymore . Max took her hand again as he answered , “
48444	48451	48460	48460	she	640	” He sighed heavily before continuing , “
48498	48513	48478	48478	She	640	” Turning toward Maddie , a remorseful look on his face , he added , “
48571	48580	48565	48565	I	10	” His voice cracked with emotion and regret . “
48591	48605	48606	48606	I	10	”Maddie looked into his contrite eyes , her chest aching from unspent tears . “
48629	48677	48680	48680	Maddie	855	” And she was happy ; her heart was overflowing with joy . She had Sam , she had a brother , and she had friends who cared about her . For a woman who had once felt unwanted , it was everything she had ever needed . “Me
48702	48734	48698	48698	you	645	” Max asked hesitantly . Tears flowed down her cheeks as she looked at her compassionate , caring brother , still looking incredibly handsome even though his tux was somewhat wilted . “
48747	48833	48744	48745	a sibling	647	” she told him wistfully , releasing his hand and wrapping her arms around his neck , clinging to him as though the bond had already been sealed . From day one , Max had brought out her protective instincts , a need to soothe his pain . It might not happen today or tomorrow , but she was determined to see him happy again in the future . Maddie sighed as Max ’s arms came around her , pulling her into a fierce hug . “
48876	48958	48961	48961	your	648	”She clung to him , tears streaming down her cheeks , already sensing that Max was a man who felt deeply . Oh , Max . You need to heal . I can feel so much pain inside you . Maddie could feel Max ’s loneliness in the desperation of his embrace . Her brother was in pain , but she could do nothing except hold him tight , hoping her joy in finding him could somehow touch his empty soul . “Hey
48968	49012	48961	48961	your	648	” Sam ’s teasing growl sounded from the door . Max and Sam exchanged grins , both of the men looking relieved that they did n’t have to brawl anymore . Maddie released her brother , turning to Sam with a worried frown . “
49022	49116	49014	49015	the doctor	649	” she asked , her voice admonishing . Her heart did a happy dance as she looked at Sam , still in tuxedo pants covered with a hospital gown . He was battered and bruised everywhere , but he had never looked so good . His smile was slightly pained and his normal fierce stride was slower from the pain of his injuries , but damn , he looked good , especially since she had feared he had been badly hurt , or worse . He gave her a wicked , lopsided grin . “
49158	49207	49208	49208	you	650	” He walked toward her slowly , and gave her a lingering kiss on her cheek . Maddie ’s breath hitched , wondering how an innocent kiss could feel so sensual . Because Sam ’s every touch is filled with intimacy and it gets to me . Bad . “So
49225	49273	49274	49275	a doctor	75	” Maddie asked , trying to keep the amusement out of her voice . She was fairly certain Sam had n’t asked the physician politely . Sam had demanded … and because he was a generous donor to the medical facility , he got whatever he wanted . “You’re
49285	49309	49274	49275	a doctor	75	” he muttered , disgruntled . Maddie folded her arms in front of her , lifting a brow as she met his gaze . “
49331	49421	49423	49423	me	10	” she informed him , trying to keep a straight face . Honestly , she could barely refrain from throwing herself into his arms and clinging to him until she convinced herself he was going to be okay . Memories of him vaulting onto that railing and leaping over a treacherous drop to get in front of her to protect her kept haunting her brain over and over like a horrible nightmare . What guy did something like that?A man who cares about me more than his own life . “You
49430	49498	49425	49425	You	650	” Sam said huskily , a teasing yet vulnerable timbre in his voice , the back of his hand smoothing over her cheek as he said it . Maddie smiled , unable to help herself . She had heard Simon and Sam banter so many times , heard Sam tell his brother the exact same words . Simon ’s answer to that particular comment was nearly always … “Not
49501	49521	49425	49425	You	650	”She caught his wandering hand and held it over her cheek , her heart racing as she answered softly , “
49542	49621	49624	49624	sweetheart	10	” Really , how could she reply to him any other way ? Sam needed love and she would never again pretend that he was n’t her world . She was done hiding her feelings and not revealing how she felt . He had terrified the hell out of her tonight . Life was too short not to say exactly how she was feeling . His eyes turned liquid , sparking like the exquisite gemstone color they resembled . “
49640	49656	49626	49626	I	10	” he rasped emotionally , his gaze entwining with hers , his eyes speaking volumes . “
49672	49681	49664	49664	I	10	you?”Maddie shook her head , unable to speak . “Forever
49683	49700	49664	49664	I	10	” he replied emphatically , his fingers wrapping around hers , his grip almost painfully tight . “
49706	49725	49726	49726	she	10	”“You have n’t been cleared to leave , and you ’re staying until I consult with the doctor , ”
49745	49747	49748	49748	he	785	“Tyrant , ”
49755	49770	49748	49748	he	785	“ It ’s pretty hot . Do you want to play doctor when we get home?”Maddie
49802	49817	49799	49799	she	10	“ You need to take it easy . You ’re going to be sore . ”Sam
49925	49944	49917	49917	Sam	785	“Whoa … we need to get your script and you need to sign your discharge papers , Sam . ”
49970	49973	49974	49974	he	785	“We’re leaving , ”
50071	50085	50086	50086	he	785	“I do n’t need the damn pills . All I need is you , ”
50130	50142	50128	50128	they	661	home.*****“Why did n’t you take my virginity when we were younger ? ”
50271	50277	50278	50278	he	785	“I could n’t do it , ”
50348	50351	50352	50352	she	855	“ Why ? ”
50356	50366	50367	50367	She	855	“ Was it because you were assaulted and molested ? ”
50376	50379	50380	50380	he	785	“You knew ? ”
50389	50406	50407	50407	she	855	“I read your medical records , Sam . Remember ? Those records were there , too , ”
50421	50423	50424	50424	he	785	“Fuck ! ”
50437	50474	50475	50475	His	785	“ I never meant for you to know . You should n’t know . I was tarnished . I was n’t worthy of you . I was a street rat who let men use my body . ”
50482	50486	50487	50487	Maddie	855	“You were molested , ”
50491	50508	50509	50509	She	855	“ It ’s nothing to be ashamed of , Sam . It was n’t your fault . ”
50545	50556	50557	50557	he	785	“I was n’t molested . I let them do it , ”
50561	50565	50566	50566	she	855	“To protect Simon , ”
50569	50577	50566	50566	she	855	“ So they would leave him alone . ”“Doesn’t
50584	50589	50581	50581	I	10	” he answered stiffly . “It
50594	50609	50592	50592	Sam	785	” she told him softly , her hand coming up to stroke his cheek . “
50615	50678	50592	50592	Sam	785	” she pleaded . How could she tell him that it was even braver of him to sacrifice himself for Simon ? He ’d submitted to the pain and humiliation to keep his younger brother from being a victim , his father getting payment in drugs and alcohol for the use of his son ’s body . Sam released a masculine sigh . “
50760	50770	50771	50771	Simon	10	” Sam ’s chest was heaving as he continued , “
50829	50860	50861	50861	They	82	”Maddie sifted her hands gently up his cheek and through his curls . Her sweet , protective , courageous man had intrepidly offered himself in place of his younger brother . “
50865	50875	50861	50861	They	82	” she whispered , tears coming to her eyes . “I
50885	50899	50883	50883	Maddie	855	” His voice was strangled , his torment over talking about it apparent . “
50944	50979	50980	50980	she	670	”“My poor Sam . I love you , baby . I hate the pain you suffered and if I could find those men , I would probably kill them . Screw my Hippocratic Oath , ”
50984	51029	51030	51030	Maddie	855	“ It was n’t your fault . You were so very heroic and brave . And you were molested , raped and assaulted . It does matter that you submitted to it to save Simon that pain . It makes it even more heartbreaking . ”
51040	51052	51030	51030	Maddie	855	“Don’t cry . Please . It was a long time ago , ”
51076	51083	51084	51084	Maddie	855	“Don’t . You ’re in pain , ”
51089	51097	51098	51098	he	785	“It will hurt more if you struggle , ”
51101	51114	51098	51098	he	785	“ And it hurts worse to not have you close to me . ”Maddie
51131	51136	51137	51137	she	670	“ Does Simon know ? ”
51141	51164	51137	51137	she	670	“No . Nobody knows except my counselor and now you . My mother would hate herself for it and so would Simon . ”“Did
51167	51208	51209	51209	he	785	help?”“Yeah . For most of the problems . I guess I have n’t quite gotten over being touched . I usually tried so hard to please a woman that she never really cared whether she touched me back or not , ”
51214	51231	51232	51232	Maddie	855	“I care . I want to touch you , Sam . I want to please you , ”
51242	51267	51269	51269	you	785	“ When we were younger , I was confused . I thought you wanted me , but you would n’t take me to bed . ”“I
51271	51281	51282	51282	I	10	” he growled , pulling her close to him . “
51320	51323	51324	51324	she	855	”“And now ? ”
51343	51367	51368	51368	he	671	“Now I ca n’t fucking help myself . You had your chance to find a better man . You ’re stuck with me , ”
51382	51389	51397	51397	Sam	785	“ You agreed to marry me . ”“There
51399	51419	51397	51397	Sam	785	” Maddie ran her finger lightly down his chest , making butterfly patterns on his abdomen with her finger . “Either
51437	51448	51449	51449	you	673	” Sam cautioned her in a voice filled with desire . “Don’t
51452	51467	51449	51449	you	673	” she questioned , her light touch stopping at the waistband of his boxers . “The
51518	51530	51510	51510	I	10	” Sam groaned , his hand coming down to covers hers . “You’re
51550	51556	51537	51537	You	673	” she told him sternly . “It
51565	51569	51570	51570	I	10	” he quipped . “
51577	51583	51584	51584	she	855	”“I want to touch you , ”
51599	51628	51630	51630	her	855	“ Will you let me ? Please . I want you to just lay there and be still . I ’ll take care of you . Can you do that?”Maddie
51656	51668	51669	51669	he	673	“If you touch me , I doubt I can be still , ”
51688	51700	51702	51702	her	855	“ But I ’ll try . I trust you , Sunshine . ”She
51784	51806	51767	51767	she	855	“ You feel so good . So hard . So masculine . I ’ve wanted to touch you for so long . ”“Fuck
51810	51818	51808	51808	Maddie	855	” he said in an agonized groan . “Yes
51820	51828	51808	51808	Maddie	855	” she breathed softly into his ear . “Your
51837	51843	51808	51808	Maddie	855	” Sam choked out harshly . “
51847	51849	51850	51850	Maddie	855	”“Never , ”
51853	51857	51858	51858	She	855	“ Only pleasure . ”
51888	51893	51894	51894	she	855	“Don’t move too much , ”
51910	51912	51913	51913	he	785	“Right , ”
51938	51944	51935	51935	she	855	“ Can I taste you ? Please?”There
51984	51994	51995	51995	he	785	“Will it feel as fucking good as your fingers ? ”
52002	52004	52005	52005	she	855	“Better , ”
52011	52022	52023	52023	he	785	“Then for God ’s sake take me in your mouth , ”
52587	52591	52592	52592	he	680	“Maddie . Fuck ! ”
52635	52647	52648	52648	she	143	“No . Sam . I do n’t want to hurt you , ”
52676	52688	52689	52689	he	680	“Then do n’t ever leave me . That would kill me , ”
52727	52738	52739	52739	Maddie	855	“Take it easy . Relax . Your ribs were bruised , ”
52762	52804	52746	52746	She	855	“ There has n’t ever been a moment since we met that I did n’t want you , Sunshine . Not ever . I wanted you back then , but I did n’t feel like I was good enough for you . ”She
52808	52823	52746	52746	She	855	“ I loved you then too . Just the way you were , Sam . ”Sam
52856	52861	52862	52862	he	680	“ Tell me again , ”
52865	52869	52871	52871	you	682	“ Say it . ”“I
52880	52890	52876	52876	I	10	” she answered with a smile in her voice . “We’re
52896	52915	52876	52876	I	10	” He pulled her tighter against him and grunted with satisfaction as her warm body melted into him . “
52920	52932	52933	52933	she	855	”“I think you ’re the most stubborn man on the planet , ”
52937	52946	52947	52947	he	680	“You love me . You know you do , ”
52950	52955	52956	52956	she	855	“Yeah . I do , ”
54506	54519	54493	54493	Sam	785	“ Fuck ! Is it true ? Have I never told her ? ”
54562	54565	54555	54555	he	785	her?“Selfish bastard , ”
54677	54683	54684	54684	he	785	“I love you , Madeline , ”
55007	55030	55031	55031	he	785	“She makes me happy , crazy , possessive , insane , ecstatic , maniacal … every emotion all at the same time , ”
55043	55049	55031	55031	he	785	“ How the hell can that be?”Strangely
55127	55162	55119	55119	she	855	one.*****“He has n’t told you he loves you ? That ’s not exactly a shocker . It took Simon a while . I guess the Hudson men just seem to think we ’re psychic , ”
55181	55188	55191	55191	she	855	“ But you know he does . ”Maddie
55228	55261	55262	55262	Maddie	855	“Are you kidding ? The crazy man nearly jumped to his death to save me from getting bruised up and injured . I do n’t doubt it . Not for a moment , ”
55286	55295	55296	55296	Kara	855	“I’m so happy you agreed to marry him , ”
55303	55316	55318	55318	he	855	“ He loves you , Maddie . I think he always has . ”“I
55321	55333	55318	55318	he	855	” I just wish he ’d say it . Just once . “
55338	55350	55351	55351	Kara	855	godchild?”“He ’s fine . Both of us are eating too much , ”
55368	55379	55357	55357	Simon	10	“ Simon , I told you it ’s a boy , ”
55401	55410	55411	55411	Kara	855	“ When are you moving in with Sam ? ”
55420	55441	55411	55411	Kara	855	“I basically already have , but it ’s official tomorrow . My stuff is being packed and brought by movers . ”Kara
55448	55457	55459	55459	her	855	“ He ’s not wasting any time , is he?”Maddie
55485	55495	55496	55496	she	855	“ Nope . But I was n’t exactly protesting , ”
55517	55548	55549	55549	Kara	855	“I still ca n’t believe Max is your brother . Although now that I know , you two both have the same unusual eyes and I can see the resemblance , ”
55552	55583	55584	55584	Maddie	855	“I still ca n’t believe it myself , but I ’m happy . I just wish he was n’t so sad . He must have loved his wife very much , ”
55587	55609	55610	55610	Kara	855	“I think he must have , but I really do n’t know . She died before Simon and I got together , ”
55623	55629	55620	55620	Maddie	855	“ So when are you coming home?”“Next
55657	55776	55777	55777	I	10	” Kara replied with laughter in her voice . Maddie smiled . Sam wanted her home on the weekends , and she had agreed . They would both be busy Monday thru Friday . Just being at the clinic every single weekday was enough to make her ecstatically happy . There would be a doctor available on Saturdays to see patients who could n’t make it to the clinic during the week , but it would n’t be her . However , she could review the weekend records and they would all be her patients . She had just finished her last shift at the hospital . Starting Monday , she would finally be back in her clinic . “Like
55783	55792	55777	55777	I	10	” Maddie asked Kara in a disgruntled voice . “
55816	55886	55887	55887	Kara	855	”“Um … hate to remind you of this … but are n’t you the one who gave me a lecture about the fact that I needed to deal with the fact that I was marrying one of the richest men in the world ? I think you even said that I should let him spend his money on me because it makes him feel like he ’s protecting me , ”
55892	55901	55902	55902	Maddie	855	“Dammit . Yeah . I did say that , ”
55926	55955	55956	55956	Kara	855	“I hope we ’re back before you guys need the jet for your honeymoon . At the rate Sam is moving , you might be married by morning , ”
55959	55965	55966	55966	Maddie	855	“He’d just get another one , ”
55973	55985	55966	55966	Maddie	855	“ He ’s pretty damn capable of getting anything he wants . ”“I
55993	56014	55988	55988	you	738	” Kara said with a chuckle . Turning onto the street where Sam ’s house was located , she answered , “
56026	56048	56019	56019	I	10	” It was the honest truth . She wanted Sam just that much . She ’d marry him in a heartbeat . “Just
56056	56060	56061	56061	We	739	” Kara warned . “
56067	56073	56074	56074	Maddie	855	”“I think we can wait , ”
56080	56093	56074	56074	Maddie	855	“You better . And we will be shopping for dresses next weekend . ”“Okay
56102	56117	56097	56097	We	739	” Maddie told her friend happily as she turned into Sam ’s long driveway . “
56127	56132	56133	56133	Kara	855	”“It ’s been lovely , ”
56139	56150	56152	56152	you	855	“ But I miss being home and I miss you . ”“I
56156	56161	56152	56152	you	855	” Maddie replied softly . “See
56165	56172	56173	56173	Maddie	855	”“Can you and Simon stop over ? ”
56184	56209	56176	56176	she	855	“Are you kidding ? We ’ll be there as soon as we get home . We need to catch up . Later , girlfriend . ”“Later
56211	56592	56594	56594	you	742	” Maddie agreed , disconnecting the call and cutting the engine . Sam ’s Bugatti was parked in the driveway , so Maddie knew he was home . Her heart leaped in anticipation , impatient to see his handsome face , bask in the warmth of his presence . As she stepped out of the SUV , she marveled at how much her life had changed in such a short period of time . Before , she had dreaded going home to her empty house , her vacant personal life . Now , she could n’t get home fast enough , could n’t be with Sam quickly enough to satisfy her need to see him . I’m not alone anymore . Maddie knew her life was finally complete . Bounding up the marbled steps , she unlocked and opened the door , feeling like she was finally home . Chapter 15 Maddie stepped into the shower with a delighted sigh , letting the decadent jets massage her body everywhere . She was tempted to linger , but her need to see Sam was greater than the pleasure of feeling the hot water relaxing her body . The temptation to go to the kitchen first had been almost irresistible . She could smell something delicious cooking , and she knew he was there . But she had n’t showered at the hospital and needed to remove the stench and germs she accumulated during her long workday before she saw him , so she ’d tiptoed through the house to the bathroom . Quickly washing her unruly hair , she had just starting spreading shower gel over her entire body when she felt the hard , unyielding presence of Sam ’s body pressing against her back . He turned her , letting her back rest against the wall and two muscular arms caged her in , his palms resting against the wall of the enclosure on both sides of her . Glancing up at him , Maddie ’s whole body started to quake as her gaze roamed over his fierce expression , his eyes so intense and covetous that her body nearly melted into puddle of liquid heat at his feet . He was so big , so hot and so hers . “I
56610	56623	56624	56624	I	10	” His hoarse voice was raw and emotional , raspy and rough . “
56689	56765	56682	56682	I	10	”Maddie swallowed hard , her eyes riveted to his . This was Sam , unrefined and unpolished , the core of the man she loved . And he had never been so scorching hot as he was at this very moment , his entire being bared to her . Tears flowed from Maddie ’s eyes , mingling with the water from the shower . She lifted a hand and ran her palm over his cheek . “
56797	56850	56854	56854	Sunshine	14	” she admitted honestly . Hearing Sam say that he loved her nearly made her come undone . Yes , she knew he loved her , but hearing his primitive declaration had her heart fluttering in an unsteady pulse and her breath coming in and out of her lips in ragged puffs . “I
56888	57111	57112	57112	Maddie	855	” he whispered in a husky voice next to her ear as he lowered his head to nip at her ear lobe . Not possible . Maddie knew she could never get tired of hearing Sam tell her how much he loved her . She could n’t regret the fact that she had never had those particular words said to her before , because Sam had been the first to say them , and it was almost surreal . His mouth covered hers , stealing her breath , mastering her lips , thrusting his tongue between her teeth . Sam ’s effect on Maddie was to take every bit of rational thought she may have had right from her head . Steam rose all around them , and pulsating jets of water assaulted their bodies , but Maddie felt nothing but Sam and his relentless assault on her senses . As he plundered her mouth , her arms snaked around his neck , trying to bring him closer . Every emotion she had ever hidden was laid bare as his hands came to hold her head in place for his desperate embrace . Fisting her hands into his wet hair , a strangled sob escaped her lips , vibrating against his mouth . He pulled back , pulling his lips from hers . “
57123	57130	57120	57120	I	10	” Sam ’s voice was worried . “Nothing
57132	57136	57137	57137	I	10	” she sobbed . “
57150	57194	57144	57144	I	10	”Resting one arm beside her head and tipping her chin up with the other hand , his eyes clashed with hers , leaving his emotions open to her . Desire . Need . Love . His expression showed all of that and more . “I
57233	57278	57279	57279	Sam	785	”His hands moved between them and cupped her breasts , weighing them in his palms , his thumbs flicking her nipples into hard pebbles . Maddie moaned , her pussy flooding with furious heat , desire to have Sam inside her burning her up . “
57283	57300	57301	57301	he	785	”“I interrupted your shower . Now I ’ll finish it and then I ’ll finish you , ”
57401	57405	57406	57406	She	855	“Yes . Please . ”
57428	57473	57474	57474	he	785	“You’re so hot , Sunshine . I love those needy sounds you make for me . Only for me . I love the fact that I can make you come when no other man ever has . And no - one has , right ? ”
57477	57481	57474	57474	he	785	“No . Never . ”
57499	57517	57494	57494	Sam	785	“ Fuck me , Sam . Make me come . I need it . I need you . ”One
57555	57560	57544	57544	his	785	“Touch me . Please , ”
57577	57587	57588	57588	he	785	“I love you , Maddie . I love you , ”
57614	57620	57608	57608	his	785	“Yes . More . Please . ”
57644	57661	57662	57662	he	785	“ Come for me . I want to watch you take your pleasure . Take it , ”
57712	57730	57731	57731	he	785	“Fuck yeah . You ’re going to come again for me . Around my cock this time , ”
57741	57751	57731	57731	he	785	“ Wrap your legs all the way around me . ”Maddie
57795	57806	57771	57771	she	855	“ Sam , oh God , you feel so good . ”His
57881	57893	57894	57894	he	785	“Tell me you need me . Tell me you ’re mine , ”
57907	57917	57918	57918	she	855	“I love you . I ’ll always need you , ”
57937	57960	57961	57961	he	785	“Fuck . There ’s nothing better than being inside you . You ’re mine , Sunshine . You always have been mine , ”
58148	58154	58141	58141	Maddie	855	“ That was almost frightening . ”Sam
58171	58181	58141	58141	Maddie	855	“ No , love . That was absolute perfection . ”
58206	58211	58197	58197	she	855	that.*****“We’re getting married soon , ”
58318	58320	58308	58308	Maddie	855	“ How soon?”“Tomorrow
58322	58327	58328	58328	We	749	” he answered hopefully . “
58334	58347	58348	58348	Maddie	855	”“Your mother , Max , Kara and Simon would never forgive us , ”
58362	58395	58396	58396	he	785	“This is about us , Sunshine . Not them . And I ’ve waited long enough . I ’ve wanted you to be mine almost from the first moment I saw you , ”
58403	58410	58396	58396	he	785	“ Did I tell you I love you?”Yeah
58436	58449	58450	58450	she	855	“Mmmm … I’m not sure . Maybe you should tell me again , ”
58453	58482	58483	58483	he	785	“I could tell you a hundred different ways and show you in so many more , but I got you a constant reminder just in case you forget , ”
58536	58549	58517	58517	Sam	785	“ I ’ve loved you forever , Maddie . Please marry me . ”Stunned
58634	58641	58642	58642	Sam	785	“You’re supposed to say yes now , ”
58649	58651	58642	58642	Sam	785	“Yes , ”
58754	58760	58750	58750	her	855	“ I had it engraved . ”She
58791	58802	58788	58788	she	855	“ How did you know you were the first to say it?”“I
58824	58880	58821	58821	I	10	” he admitted sheepishly . Maddie smiled , unable to help herself . She loved his honesty , the way he had come right out and unhesitatingly confessed what he had done . No , he should n’t have read her journals , but she had nothing to hide from Sam and she never would . “
58902	58917	58918	58918	he	10	”“I did . I did n’t want anyone knowing you like that except me , ”
58934	58944	58945	58945	he	10	“ Now tell me you ’ll marry me tomorrow , ”
58960	58963	58948	58948	he	10	“Sam , we can’t-”“Oh
58969	58988	58989	58989	Sam	785	” He swung her up into his arms . Maddie squealed and wrapped her arms around his shoulders . “
58993	59005	59006	59006	he	10	you-”“No more talk . It ’s time to do some convincing , ”
59348	59356	59357	59357	she	855	“I ca n’t believe we ’re married , ”
59369	59374	59357	59357	she	855	“You’re mine . Forever , ”
59453	59474	59449	59449	Maddie	855	“ Thank you for the lovely ceremony . I do n’t how you arranged it , but it was wonderful . ”They
59545	59549	59550	59550	he	405	“You deserved better , ”
59553	59588	59550	59550	he	405	“ I just could n’t wait any longer , Sunshine . We ’ve waited so long . I needed you to be mine . I ’ll make it up to you with the honeymoon . ”Maddie
59594	59603	59604	59604	Sam	785	“ I thought we just had our honeymoon . ”
59633	59678	59679	59679	he	405	“We’re going away together . For several weeks . Right after this reception that Mom and Kara are insisting we have . I want to take you anywhere that you want to go , Maddie . I want to make up for lost time , ”
59696	59748	59749	59749	Maddie	855	“I’m not sure we have to make up for anything , Sam . Maybe everything worked out the way it needed to be . Everything feels so right now . I ’ll never take what we have for granted because I know how much it hurts to not be with you . ”
59752	59815	59816	59816	I	10	“ I was focused on school and being a doctor for so many years , and you were busy trying to conquer the world . Maybe it just was n’t the right time for us back then . I ’d do it all over again , suffer the same loneliness for years , just to be right where I am right now . ”“But
59831	59839	59821	59821	I	10	” Sam answered , his voice graveled . “You
59902	59906	59907	59907	you	772	” she admitted . “Would
59909	59911	59912	59912	she	772	Sunshine?”“Yes , ”
59916	59935	59912	59912	she	772	“ Without a doubt . If you had it to do over again … would you do the same thing?”Sam
59945	60003	59912	59912	she	772	“ Now ? Hell no . I ’d strap you to my side and protect you myself . But I did n’t have the resources or connections then that I do now . So yeah … I probably would if I was in the same situation that I was then . Your safety comes before anything else . ”His
