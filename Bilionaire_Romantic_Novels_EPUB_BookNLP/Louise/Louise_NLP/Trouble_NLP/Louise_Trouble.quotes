1569	1574	1575	1575	She	276	“ The black Mercedes ? ”

2367	2392	2394	2394	I	1454	“ No need to apologize . I figured you did n’t want to end up on your bottom in the middle of the garden . ”
2439	2443	2448	2448	I	1454	“ Oh no . ”
2462	2472	2448	2448	I	1454	“ I hope I did n’t spill on you . ”

2633	2637	2625	2625	I	1454	“ Thank you . ”
2638	2671	2625	2625	I	1454	“ Are you embarrassed ? I would think you ’d be accustomed to such praise . It ’s a stunning creation . I ’m not sure I recognize some of these flowers . ”
2672	2675	2676	2676	I	1454	“ Oh . ”
2691	2700	2686	2686	I	1454	“ They ’re mostly tropicals . Nothing special . ”
2701	2710	2711	2711	He	293	“ I disagree . They ’re very special . ”
2727	2753	2711	2711	He	293	“ I know you . You were in Daisy ’s store that day in Oceanside . You ’re the antiques guy . Stuart … No … ”
2754	2757	2721	2721	his	293	“ Spencer . ”
2782	2792	2778	2778	He	293	“ Do n’t you think you ’ve had enough ? ”
2793	2796	2797	2797	I	1454	“ No . ”
2805	2818	2819	2819	His	293	“ And I do n’t like men telling me what to do . ”
2833	2843	2819	2819	His	293	“ I did n’t mean to overstep , Joselyn . ”
2844	2851	2819	2819	His	293	“ You have a good memory . ”
2852	2864	2819	2819	His	293	“ I never forget a face . Definitely not a redhead . ”
2865	2875	2819	2819	His	293	“ Redheads are trouble , do n’t you know ? ”
2876	2884	2885	2885	He	293	“ I ’m not afraid of trouble . ”
2906	2916	2889	2889	his	293	“ Daisy calls you something different . A nickname … ”
2917	2920	2932	2932	His	293	“ Sly . ”
2921	2931	2932	2932	His	293	“ I ’m sure there ’s a story there . ”
2942	2947	2932	2932	His	293	“ I prefer Joselyn . ”
3097	3104	3085	3085	I	1454	“ Excuse me just a second . ”
3120	3125	3107	3108	Mr. Bossy	68	“ Hey , Sly . ”
3143	3157	3107	3108	Mr. Bossy	68	“ Hey , Max . I did n’t know you were working tonight . ”

3204	3208	3209	3209	I	1454	“ Surf competition ? ”
3243	3251	3224	3224	I	1454	“ First of the Prime East competitions . ”
3252	3255	3256	3256	I	1454	“ Cool , ”
3269	3276	3277	3277	Spencer	621	“ Have you made a friend ? ”
3290	3293	3277	3277	Spencer	621	“ Mm . ”
3302	3319	3294	3294	I	1454	“ Max , this is Spencer . Spencer , Max . We used to work together . ”
3328	3332	3320	3320	I	1454	“ Good luck . ”
3346	3353	3333	3333	Spencer	621	“ Where did you work together ? ”
3354	3373	3320	3320	I	1454	“ I was a cater - waiter in college . I actually hired these guys for the reception . ”
3374	3383	3333	3333	Spencer	621	“ You ’re a Jill of all trades . ”
3384	3389	3390	3390	I	1454	“ Master of none , ”
3399	3404	3394	3394	he	70	“ Let ’s dance . ”
3405	3413	3320	3320	I	1454	“ You ’re not here with anyone ? ”
3414	3425	3426	3426	He	70	“ I would never take a date to a wedding . ”
3435	3440	3426	3426	He	70	“ And why not ? ”
3479	3485	3486	3486	I	1454	“ I have my reasons . ”
3528	3533	3534	3534	Spencer	621	“ Baby Got Back . ”
3638	3650	3632	3632	Elliot	58	“ I hope you do n’t take this the wrong way … ”
3658	3664	3651	3651	His	621	“ You secretly hate flowers ? ”
3672	3682	3651	3651	His	621	“ You have the perfect body for that dress . ”
3696	3709	3690	3690	I	1454	“ You do n’t think I need to lose a few pounds ? ”
3718	3734	3735	3735	He	58	“ Do n’t you dare . You ’re a perfect hourglass , a vintage beauty . ”
3746	3765	3735	3735	He	58	“ I ’m sure that ’s why Daisy picked it for you . She has a great eye . ”
3766	3769	3770	3770	We	306	“ Right . ”
3781	3790	3770	3770	We	306	“ I ’m sorry if I offended you . ”
3791	3798	3799	3799	I	1454	“ No . You did n’t . ”
3836	3848	3817	3817	He	58	“ How does a man like you get interested in antiques ? ”
3849	3855	3817	3817	He	58	“ A man like me ? ”
3856	3877	3817	3817	He	58	“ Yeah . You ’re not an old professor in a moth - eaten coat with crumbs in your beard . ”
3878	3882	3883	3883	He	58	“ Thank God . ”
3888	3895	3883	3883	He	58	“ So what ’s your story ? ”
3896	3931	3817	3817	He	58	“ I was born into it . My father had the largest , best - curated collection of priceless antiques in Newport . Drake Carrollton was the best in the business . A legend . ”
3932	3938	3817	3817	He	58	“ Are you a legend ? ”
3939	3945	3946	3946	His	58	“ I ’m an asshole . ”
3952	3967	3946	3946	His	58	“ I ’ve heard that about you . Daisy says you ’re Mr. Freeze . ”
3968	4007	4012	4012	I	1454	“ I do n’t waste time on sentimentality . We deal with junk found in attics or sorted after the death of a relative . Your cousin gets too emotionally involved . It ’s a waste of energy . ”
4008	4011	4012	4012	I	1454	“ Right . ”
4031	4036	4021	4021	he	58	“ She told me . ”
4175	4187	4188	4188	Spencer	621	“ How does a pinup like you get involved in flowers ? ”
4205	4208	4200	4200	I	1454	“ Disney ? ”
4217	4266	4214	4214	I	1454	“ I always loved watching those old parades , the Rose Bowl and Mardi Gras . Then my mom took me to Epcot once , and when I saw all the gardens , I realized people actually did this for a living . I could n’t believe it . ”
4331	4345	4346	4346	He	621	“ Well , I ca n’t speak to your work as a waitress , ”
4357	4368	4369	4369	I	1454	“ But your skill as a florist is quite masterful . ”
4392	4395	4390	4390	Mercurial	77	“ What ? ”
4396	4402	4390	4390	Mercurial	77	“ The way you talk . ”
4403	4408	4390	4390	Mercurial	77	“ What about it ? ”
4409	4422	4390	4390	Mercurial	77	“ Do you always speak like you ’re reading from an encyclopedia ? ”
4423	4432	4433	4433	He	621	“ I do n’t know what you mean . ”
4442	4452	4453	4453	I	1454	“ Your skill as an artist is quite masterful . ”
4466	4473	4453	4453	I	1454	“ I sound nothing like that . ”
4479	4486	4474	4474	I	1454	“ I sound nothing like that . ”
4487	4491	4497	4497	His	621	“ Stop it . ”
4492	4496	4497	4497	His	621	“ Stop it . ”
4560	4568	4569	4569	His	621	“ Do n’t mock me , Joselyn . ”
4595	4599	4584	4584	He	621	“ Or what ? ”
4899	4905	4888	4888	his	621	“ You are so gorgeous . ”
4923	4939	4916	4916	his	621	“ I have a room in this hotel . Let me fuck you all night . ”
5015	5024	5025	5025	My	1454	“ I ’m sorry . I ca n’t . ”
5037	5043	5030	5030	I	1454	“ I have a boyfriend . ”
5044	5048	5025	5025	My	1454	“ Dump him . ”
5049	5056	5057	5057	He	621	“ I ca n’t do that . ”
5124	5129	5119	5119	I	1454	“ Goodnight , Spencer . ”
5210	5214	5209	5209	Spencer	621	“ Antiques Now . ”
5256	5275	5246	5246	he	326	“ He has an exclamation point in the title . It ’s like a disaster film . Earthquake ! ”
5276	5282	5283	5283	I	1454	“ It ’s Zoomer nonsense . ”
5297	5319	5283	5283	I	1454	“ Is this why you called me in here ? To discuss an unaffiliated scrub on the Internet talking about antiques ? ”
5320	5332	5353	5353	he	326	“ What are we going to do about this , Spencer ? ”
5333	5337	5338	5338	I	1454	“ About what ? ”
5361	5371	5353	5353	he	326	“ Link Sherlock . He practically stole our name . ”
5372	5380	5381	5381	I	1454	“ Please tell me you ’re joking . ”
5412	5416	5407	5407	He	272	“ Ignore him . ”
5440	5459	5433	5433	he	272	“ He ’s got this … YouTube and TikTok . The man has more than a million followers . ”
5460	5467	5468	5468	I	1454	“ He is not a man . ”
5672	5680	5681	5681	Miles	78	“ He ’s courting Brimfield and Skinner . ”
5698	5706	5681	5681	Miles	78	“ Grafton was on his last episode . ”
5707	5713	5670	5670	Sin	1536	“ What does it matter ? ”
5714	5748	5749	5751	My diminutive partner	339	“ It matters because when he puts them in front of millions of viewers , they ’ll go to him first with their acquisitions . He ’ll have first look at their catalogs . ”
5805	5815	5816	5816	I	1454	“ Let ’s look at this from another angle . ”
5831	5875	5876	5876	Miles	78	“ This … Link Sherlock , despite the ridiculous name , is presenting the world of antiques to a new generation of buyers and collectors . They ’re taking their first sip of coffee milk or venturing into the livestock shows in Branson . ”
5882	5890	5876	5876	Miles	78	“ I ’m not sure I follow … ”
5891	5942	5943	5943	Miles	78	“ Mr. Sherlock will whet their appetite , but we own this field . We ’ve made collecting antiquities an art . He ’s a barker at the county fair . We ’re the auctioneers at Southeby ’s . They ’ll come to us when they ’re ready for class . ”
5952	5955	5956	5956	He	78	“ Class … ”
5975	5987	5970	5970	he	78	“ I like it , but how will they find us ? ”
5988	6002	5970	5970	he	78	“ The same way anyone finds anything of value . Word of mouth . ”
6027	6033	5970	5970	he	78	“ And Brimfield ? Skinner ? ”
6034	6054	5970	5970	he	78	“ They ’re smart to court his attention . He ’ll bring a new audience , freshen the market . ”
6055	6083	6084	6084	I	1454	“ I think we need to remind them we ’re here . Remind them we ’re still top of the line , ready when they need us . ”
6095	6102	6084	6084	I	1454	“ How will we do that ? ”
6103	6107	6084	6084	I	1454	“ A gala . ”
6108	6111	6112	6112	My	1454	“ Gala . ”
6146	6168	6132	6132	They	343	“ I do n’t think that ’s necessary . I ’ll do my usual rounds , pay them all a visit — ”
6169	6189	6132	6132	They	343	“ Do n’t get me wrong , friend , but you ’re hardly the warmest cookie on the platter . ”
6190	6212	6132	6132	They	343	“ I ’m not sure I follow that metaphor . Still , I have established relationships . It ’ll be fine . ”
6213	6226	6227	6227	He	345	“ It ’ll be old - fashioned . People want new things . ”
6242	6272	6227	6227	He	345	“ We can go all out , maybe something outdoors , on Lake Murray . Luxury accommodations , a video montage of us through the years , SWAG bags … ”
6273	6277	6132	6132	They	343	“ SWAG bags ? ”
6278	6291	6132	6132	They	343	“ Stuff We All Get . You know , robes and iPads . ”
6292	6309	6227	6227	He	345	“ I ’m aware of what SWAG is . How will robes and gadgets sell antiques ? ”
6310	6317	6132	6132	They	343	“ They ’ll show we care . ”
6318	6351	6132	6132	They	343	“ Here ’s how we show we care . I have a meeting with Grafton in a few weeks . I ’ll do a quick tour of our Vermont and Pennsylvania locations — ”
6352	6367	6368	6368	He	346	“ I ’ll save you the trip . We ’re bringing them to us . ”
6438	6446	6431	6431	I	1454	“ So you ’re thinking Lake Murray ? ”
6447	6452	6453	6453	He	346	“ You ’re right . ”
6461	6493	6494	6494	His	346	“ The coast is better . Daisy ’s there now . We can bring her onboard to help us . It ’ll benefit her business as well . Win - win ! ”
6523	6531	6532	6532	He	346	“ It might be worth a try . ”
6542	6549	6532	6532	He	346	“ That ’s a sudden switch . ”
6561	6583	6532	6532	He	346	“ Daisy ’s wedding reception last month was quite elegant . She has good taste , and she knows our clients . ”
6584	6618	6619	6619	He	346	“ Excellent . Set up a time for us to meet here in the office . We can hash out all the details , set a date , and get the ball rolling . ”
6629	6636	6619	6619	He	346	“ Glad you discovered that girl . ”
7065	7070	7064	7064	Joselyn	177	“ It ’s happening . ”
7099	7106	7089	7089	I	1454	“ He ’s going to propose . ”
7107	7115	7116	7116	Daisy	446	“ Is that really what you want ? ”
7123	7139	7116	7116	Daisy	446	“ God , is it so hard for you to just be happy for me ? ”
7140	7161	7162	7163	My cousin	276	“ Is it so hard for you not to act like a fifteen - year - old on her period ? ”
7189	7209	7180	7180	She	276	“ It ’s what I ’ve been waiting for , Daisy . Yes , it ’s what I want . ”
7210	7223	7224	7224	She	276	“ Well , he ’s definitely got you where he wants you . ”
7233	7247	7224	7224	She	276	“ You ’ve given up half your clients , moved in with him — ”
7248	7275	7180	7180	She	276	“ I wanted to move in with him . His place is gorgeous , and I ’m there if he has a spasm in the night . ”
7276	7311	7312	7312	I	1454	“ You were just building your client list . Now you ’re his personal nurse . Next , you ’ll be his wife . Then you ’ll have nothing of your own at all . ”
7420	7438	7460	7460	she	369	“ Elliot is my primary client because it helps him . He takes good care of me . ”
7439	7446	7460	7460	she	369	“ He ’s your only client . ”
7447	7457	7460	7460	she	369	“ That ’s not true . I have others . ”
7689	7708	7709	7709	I	1454	“ Were n’t you just fighting last week ? What makes you think he ’s going to propose ? ”
7717	7736	7709	7709	I	1454	“ I accidentally opened his credit card bill , and I saw a huge charge at Jared ’s . ”
7737	7768	7769	7770	Damn Daisy	446	“ Hold the phone . Snooping in his mail is a big red flag . Also , seriously ? What kind of engagement rings do they have at Jared ’s ? ”
7772	7776	7777	7777	I	1454	“ Nice ones ! ”
7795	7833	7790	7790	I	1454	“ I ’m hanging up now . I ’ll call you after he proposes . Or better yet , I ’ll send you a photo of my gorgeous new ring . Then I ’ll accept your apology . ”
7834	7843	7844	7844	Her	446	“ Hang on , do n’t hang up . ”
7848	7877	7844	7844	Her	446	“ I ’m worried about you , cuz . I want you to be with someone who deserves you . Someone who ’s going to make you happy . ”
7878	7884	7885	7885	My	1454	“ Elliot makes me happy . ”
7902	7909	7896	7896	I	1454	“ I ’ll call you later . ”
7910	7916	7844	7844	Her	446	“ Love you , bitch . ”
7917	7922	7896	7896	I	1454	“ Love you more . ”
8187	8197	8177	8177	His	58	“ Hey , babe . You ’re back early . ”
8216	8224	8225	8225	I	1454	“ I ’ve been gone three hours . ”
8242	8252	8225	8225	I	1454	“ Are you okay ? Is your back hurting ? ”
8253	8258	8259	8259	He	58	“ No , no . ”
8273	8292	8225	8225	I	1454	“ I ’m good . I was just getting changed . Thought I might go for a jog . ”
8293	8296	8297	8297	I	1454	“ Really ? ”
8307	8313	8297	8297	I	1454	“ It ’s after six . ”
8314	8359	8225	8225	I	1454	“ On a Thursday . Did you want to go to dinner or something ? We can make a reservation for tomorrow . Tell you what , why do n’t you run down and ask Eric if he ’ll set that up for us ? ”
8360	8371	8372	8372	My	1454	“ Run down ? I can call him from here . ”
8388	8394	8377	8377	I	1454	“ What ’s going on ? ”
8453	8462	8463	8463	Elliot	58	“ What the hell would be going on ? ”
8474	8480	8470	8470	he	58	“ You ’re being silly . ”
8481	8485	8470	8470	he	58	“ Am I ? ”
8486	8521	8522	8522	I	1454	“ Tell you what , I ’ll skip the run , and we can take our chances . Let ’s go out to dinner . I ’m sure we can get a table somewhere . ”
8606	8613	8614	8614	My	1454	“ Who ’s here , Elliot ? ”
8636	8647	8648	8648	He	58	“ I do n’t know what you mean , babe . ”
8672	8681	8661	8661	He	58	“ I ’m here . You ’re here . ”
8682	8688	8689	8689	I	1454	“ Who else is here ? ”
8722	8731	8742	8742	He	58	“ I never make the bed this well . ”
8732	8741	8742	8742	He	58	“ I did n’t want to say anything … ”
8868	8872	8873	8873	I	1454	“ Your secretary ? ”
8883	8886	8887	8887	Nadine	97	“ Surprise … ”
8963	8968	8969	8969	He	58	“ I can explain . ”
9029	9037	9038	9038	Elliot	58	“ Joselyn , what are you doing ? ”
9059	9072	9038	9038	Elliot	58	“ Even an idiot like you can see what I ’m doing . ”
9073	9079	9080	9080	His	58	“ Do n’t do this . ”
9094	9109	9110	9110	His	58	“ Take your hand off me , or I ’ll rip your head off . ”
9230	9242	9243	9244	Idiot Flick	60	“ I wish you would slow down and let me explain . ”
9291	9295	9296	9296	My	1454	“ Is that … ”
9318	9321	9322	9322	Elliot	58	“ What ? ”
9367	9377	9365	9365	Sly	124	“ I ’ll leave my key card with Eric . ”
9396	9399	9400	9400	He	58	“ Sly … ”
9425	9433	9412	9412	He	58	“ I never meant to hurt you . ”
9434	9442	9412	9412	He	58	“ I hope your dick falls off . ”
9459	9473	9412	9412	He	58	“ I knew . That ’s the whole problem . I always knew . ”
9555	9562	9563	9563	She	414	“ It ’s not your fault . ”
9571	9585	9563	9563	She	414	“ If you ’d known , you would n’t have stayed with him . ”
9599	9637	9563	9563	She	414	“ I kept holding on to the memories of when we met , how things were those first months . I could n’t believe he would let that go … God , I ’m such a fool . ”
9638	9645	9646	9646	She	414	“ You ’re an amazing person . ”
9715	9735	9708	9709	her ex	418	“ If he would throw what you had away for a bimbo secretary , he deserves whatever he gets . ”
9743	9771	9736	9736	I	1454	“ We had n’t had sex in three months . I knew he was sleeping with someone else . I just could n’t let everyone be right . ”
9783	9789	9776	9776	I	1454	“ I ’m the idiot . ”
9790	9812	9813	9813	She	419	“ You loved him . I remember how giddy you were the day he asked you to move in with him . ”
9820	9841	9813	9813	She	419	“ You ’re not an idiot for loving someone . He ’s a loser for not valuing what you had . ”
9842	9867	9813	9813	She	419	“ It was too fast . I ’m so impulsive . I moved in with him after only three weeks . Who does that ? ”
9881	9892	9893	9893	She	419	“ That ’s it . No men for a year . ”
9898	9906	9893	9893	She	419	“ You ’ll find somebody new tomorrow . ”
9907	9917	9918	9918	Courtney	414	“ Nope . This chick is off the market . ”
9924	9931	9918	9918	Courtney	414	“ He does n’t deserve you . ”
9940	9951	9932	9932	I	1454	“ Men are rats . They ’re fleas on rats . ”
9952	9960	9963	9963	me	1454	“ He ’s probably a Clemson fan . ”
9973	9983	9967	9967	I	1454	“ Two of my best friends went to Clemson . ”
9984	9997	9998	9998	We	421	“ Oh , well . He ’s a USC fan , then . ”
10029	10038	10039	10039	Courtney	414	“ Are n’t you supposed to be sleeping ? ”
10085	10096	10097	10097	He	422	“ Hey , buddy . Are we being too loud ? ”
10108	10114	10097	10097	He	422	“ Why are you crying ? ”
10130	10149	10150	10150	He	422	“ I thought I was getting a present , but I got a kick in the pants instead . ”
10159	10166	10150	10150	He	422	“ Mom says kicking is bad . ”
10167	10179	10197	10197	she	425	“ Your mom ’s right . I should ’ve known better . ”
10180	10185	10197	10197	she	425	“ Somebody kicked you ? ”
10186	10189	10197	10197	she	425	“ No … ”
10201	10244	10245	10245	Oliver	374	“ It ’s a figure of speech . Like an unpleasant surprise . I found out somebody was n’t who I thought he was . Or he was who I thought he was , and I did n’t want to admit it . ”
10275	10293	10294	10294	His	374	“ Aunt Sly is going to stay with us a few days . Is n’t that fun ? ”
10307	10315	10299	10299	he	374	“ Can she sleep in my room ? ”
10316	10330	10331	10331	He	374	“ You ’ve got the twin beds , so I guess I will . ”
10340	10359	10331	10331	He	374	“ We can build a fort and tell ghost stories and I ’ll let you hold Chartreuse and — ”
10360	10370	10371	10371	Court	414	“ Tonight , you need to go to sleep . ”
10386	10400	10381	10381	I	1454	“ Aunt Sly will be along later . You ’ve got school tomorrow . ”
10412	10425	10426	10426	She	428	“ I wonder if I could afford a place in The Vista ? ”
10429	10435	10426	10426	She	428	“ It ’s pretty expensive . ”
10436	10448	10451	10451	my	1454	“ Yeah , and I ’m down to three clients now . ”
10461	10476	10454	10454	I	1454	“ I ’ll probably have to move back to Fireside . Live with Ma . ”
10477	10503	10426	10426	She	428	“ You ’re staying right here until you ’re back on your feet . You ca n’t build a client list from three hours away . ”
10504	10511	10512	10512	She	428	“ Two and a half hours . ”
10521	10545	10512	10512	She	428	“ You ’re right . If I want to work here , I have to live here . Just promise me one thing . ”
10546	10549	10426	10426	She	428	“ What ? ”
10550	10563	10564	10564	She	428	“ When you ’ve had enough , you ’ll kick me out . ”
10572	10586	10564	10564	She	428	“ Shut up . I ’m not kicking you out . Free babysitting ! ”
10592	10606	10564	10564	She	428	“ You know it . What else will I be doing all year ? ”
10894	10899	10900	10900	Miles	78	“ Eleven - ten . ”
10917	10923	10904	10904	I	1454	“ I tweaked my back . ”
10955	10966	10967	10967	He	276	“ I beat you fair and square . Admit it . ”
10982	10996	10967	10967	He	276	“ I have no problem admitting if you beat me fair and square . ”
11017	11032	10997	10997	I	1454	“ I tweaked my back when I hit the wall in our second match . ”
11033	11038	11039	11039	he	276	“ Tweaked your back , ”
11049	11059	11039	11039	he	276	“ Do n’t be a poor loser , Freeze . ”
11101	11107	11108	11108	His	276	“ Congrats on your win . ”
11113	11119	11108	11108	His	276	“ You ’re patronizing me . ”
11120	11126	11127	11127	I	1454	“ Good God , Miles . ”
11145	11153	11133	11133	I	1454	“ Do n’t be a poor winner . ”
11154	11162	11163	11163	He	276	“ Fuck , look at the time . ”
11168	11179	11163	11163	He	276	“ We ’ve got to meet Daisy in twenty minutes . ”
11340	11348	11349	11349	Daisy	446	“ Good afternoon , Miles . Spencer . ”
11368	11380	11381	11381	I	1454	“ Can you believe I ’ve never been in this room ? ”
11388	11394	11381	11381	I	1454	“ We rarely use it . ”
11395	11400	11401	11401	She	445	“ Why have it ? ”
11412	11418	11401	11401	She	445	“ Mmm … Chicken salad . ”
11419	11426	11427	11427	Miles	78	“ For moments such as this . ”
11433	11442	11427	11427	Miles	78	“ Would you like a snack , Miss … ”
11443	11455	11462	11462	she	445	“ Winthrop . Joselyn . I ’m good , thank you . ”
11537	11542	11533	11533	She	445	“ Sorry , Miles , ”
11553	11594	11543	11543	Daisy	446	“ I forgot you have n’t met my cousin . Sly , this is Miles Klaut , founder of Antiques Today . He ’s a legend in the business and not at all as scary as he seems at first . ”
11595	11601	11602	11602	Miles	78	“ Do I seem scary ? ”
11615	11626	11602	11602	Miles	78	“ It ’s nice to meet you , Miss Winthrop . ”
11647	11658	11638	11638	she	445	“ It ’s nice to see you again , Joselyn . ”
11659	11662	11663	11663	Her	445	“ Spencer . ”

11709	11722	11723	11723	Miles	78	“ Spencer said you ’re an artist when it comes to flowers . ”
11735	11739	11730	11730	she	445	“ An artist ? ”
11752	11766	11740	11740	She	445	“ I described what I saw . Would you like something to drink ? ”
11767	11776	11777	11777	She	445	“ I ’ll have a water , thanks . ”
11916	11942	11910	11910	She	446	“ Sly has connections with one of the best caterers in the area , and of course , she ’ll handle all the floral arrangements . ”
11943	11953	11954	11954	Her	446	“ Did you have anything in particular in mind ? ”
11967	11979	11954	11954	Her	446	“ We ’re lucky that we can get almost anything here . ”
11980	11993	11994	11994	I	1454	“ I think the New Englanders would be most impressed by tropicals . ”
12013	12033	12002	12002	Daisy	446	“ Did you bring your portfolio , Sly ? Show Miles the one you did with the tiger lilies . ”
12034	12039	12040	12040	Joselyn	177	“ I did n’t … ”
12053	12070	12040	12040	Joselyn	177	“ It ’s in Fireside . I - I was n’t planning to do this anymore . ”
12071	12080	12081	12081	Miles	78	“ No need to apologize , Miss Winthrop . ”
12092	12109	12110	12110	Her	446	“ Anyone who can make an impression on Mr. Freeze here must be worth her salt . ”
12124	12132	12133	12133	Daisy	446	“ Who ’s on the guest list ? ”
12183	12193	12233	12233	Joselyn	177	“ I ’ve got Brimfield and Skinner . Grafton — ”

12409	12418	12419	12419	Miles	78	“ How soon can we make it happen ? ”
12431	12435	12436	12436	She	446	“ Two weeks ? ”
12442	12457	12436	12436	She	446	“ What do you think , Sly ? Will that give you enough time ? ”
12458	12463	12464	12464	Joselyn	177	“ I think so . ”
12474	12477	12478	12478	He	446	“ Yes ? ”
12482	12495	12478	12478	He	446	“ I ’ll send invitations as soon as you verify the venue . ”
12496	12507	12508	12508	Daisy	446	“ I ’ll make some calls on the drive home . ”
12518	12536	12508	12508	Daisy	446	“ Now I ’ve got to hit the road . I ’ve got a husband to feed . ”
12541	12548	12549	12549	Miles	78	“ Is it after five already ? ”
12563	12590	12549	12549	Miles	78	“ I ’ve got a date with my Netflix . I just started the Cecil Hotel doc . Very nice to meet you , Miss Winthrop . ”
12614	12621	12622	12622	I	1454	“ She was always his favorite , ”
12633	12639	12640	12640	Joselyn	177	“ She ’s a pixie . ”
12653	12668	12640	12640	Joselyn	177	“ You do n’t have to clean . Maintenance will take care of it . ”
12679	12689	12674	12674	she	446	“ I ’m used to doing all the jobs . ”
12690	12700	12674	12674	she	446	“ Daisy told me you ’re self - employed . ”
12701	12714	12674	12674	she	446	“ Trying to be . I recently had a change in circumstance . ”
12715	12720	12721	12721	I	1454	“ You fired yourself ? ”

19651	19665	19585	19585	I	1454	“ Daisy said … Spencer told her you wanted to see my portfolio . ”
19666	19670	19585	19585	I	1454	“ He did ? ”
19698	19702	19703	19703	He	536	“ No worries . ”
19707	19725	19726	19726	He	536	“ I hate you made a special trip , though . Is n’t your portfolio online somewhere ? ”
19743	19777	19726	19726	He	536	“ That would probably be a smart idea . The truth is , I thought I was done with this type of work , so I never made time to scan it all — ”
19778	19790	19791	19791	He	536	“ Oh yes , we ’re pulling you out of retirement . ”
19806	19820	19797	19797	he	536	“ Spencer , can you join Miss Winthrop and me in my office ? ”
19821	19826	19827	19827	Spencer	621	“ Be right there . ”
19961	19970	19971	19971	My	1454	“ Let ’s see what we ’ve got . ”
20011	20038	20039	20039	Miles	78	“ Take a seat and we ’ll run through it . Or should we go to the conference room ? Which would you prefer , Joselyn ? ”
20042	20052	20039	20039	Miles	78	“ Do you mind if I call you Joselyn ? ”
20058	20064	20065	20065	My	1454	“ I do n’t mind . ”
20083	20117	20065	20065	My	1454	“ It ’s your call . We can go through the folder here or we can use one of the large tables to spread them out and look at the pictures all together . ”
20118	20131	20132	20132	Miles	78	“ I ’m sure Daisy told you the Oceanside Hotel said yes . ”
20139	20152	20132	20132	Miles	78	“ You ’ve worked in their facilities . What would you recommend ? ”
20187	20209	20179	20179	I	1454	“ I ’ve done so many different events … This is the first time I ’ve done anything for antique dealers . ”
20210	20226	20227	20227	Miles	78	“ They ’re just as banal and boring as everyone else , I assure you . ”
20239	20242	20243	20243	I	1454	“ Okay … ”
20253	20270	20271	20271	Miles	78	“ If I at least had an idea of what type of theme you were wanting . ”
20277	20299	20271	20271	Miles	78	“ I had hoped you or Daisy could take the lead on that . Themes are n’t really my strong suit . ”
20300	20309	20310	20310	Spencer	621	“ He ’s more of an idea guy . ”
20334	20358	20326	20326	He	621	“ Tell you what , I ’ll take Joselyn to my office , and we can go through this and pull something together . ”
20359	20362	20363	20363	Miles	78	“ Brilliant ! ”
20373	20387	20363	20363	Miles	78	“ I do n’t mind working something up for you on my own — ”
20388	20399	20400	20400	Spencer	621	“ I have some ideas I ’d like to discuss . ”
20449	20452	20440	20440	I	1454	“ Okay . ”
20458	20464	20465	20465	Miles	78	“ I like this plan . ”
20472	20491	20465	20465	Miles	78	“ Spencer has impeccable taste . I ca n’t wait to see what you two come up with . ”
20543	20548	20549	20549	Miles	78	“ Chivalry is dead . ”
20556	20573	20549	20549	Miles	78	“ His office is just at the other corner there . The north and the south . ”
20574	20579	20549	20549	Miles	78	“ Warmth versus freezing ? ”
20580	20599	20549	20549	Miles	78	“ Something like that . He wo n’t win Mr. Congeniality , but he ’s hardly ever wrong . ”
20685	20691	20684	20684	Spencer	621	“ These pieces should work . ”
20717	20742	20684	20684	Spencer	621	“ Since that show on Netflix , everyone is into this royal type of thing . Or maybe it ’s since that Oprah interview . ”
20743	20752	20794	20794	She	548	“ This is actually Belle and Prince Adam . ”
20753	20761	20684	20684	Spencer	621	“ I ’m not familiar with them . ”
20762	20768	20769	20769	Her	548	“ Beauty and the Beast ? ”
20821	20841	20820	20820	I.	1454	“ I did this for the high school prom one year , ‘ Tale as Old as Time . ’ ”
20842	20851	20820	20820	I.	1454	“ Was it for your high school prom ? ”
20852	20868	20820	20820	I.	1454	“ No , I was in college at that point . I needed the money . ”
20908	20929	20930	20930	Morons	125	“ Go with that . Miles will think he ’s in a Disney movie . Hell , they all will . ”
20932	20937	20938	20938	She	548	“ So Regency romance . ”
20944	20955	20938	20938	She	548	“ Should we tell them to dress in period attire ? ”
20956	20967	20973	20973	she	548	“ God , no . It ’s not a carnival . ”
20979	20991	20973	20973	she	548	“ You ’d be surprised how much people love wearing costumes . ”
20992	20997	20998	20998	I	1454	“ Nothing surprises me . ”
21030	21037	21038	21038	She	548	“ You appear to be well . ”
21048	21055	21038	21038	She	548	“ Why would n’t I be ? ”
21056	21074	21038	21038	She	548	“ Why else would you sneak out in the middle of the night unless you were ill ? ”
21090	21099	21106	21106	her	548	“ Unless you had some sort of emergency . ”
21147	21152	21139	21139	She	548	“ I ’m sorry . ”
21180	21193	21173	21173	her	548	“ Friday was a mistake . I apologize for my unprofessional behavior . ”
21206	21219	21200	21200	I	1454	“ You do n’t have to apologize . We ’re consenting adults . ”
21220	21239	21244	21244	My	1454	“ Yes , but I do n’t sleep with clients . I ’d had too much to drink — ”
21240	21243	21244	21244	My	1454	“ Stop . ”
21256	21265	21244	21244	My	1454	“ I do not sleep with intoxicated women . ”
21266	21269	21270	21270	She	548	“ No … ”
21276	21281	21270	21270	She	548	“ I only meant … ”
21282	21307	21308	21308	Her	548	“ I ordered food , which you refused to eat . I believe your exact words were not to tell you what to do . ”
21319	21342	21313	21313	she	548	“ You ’re right . I said those things . It was poor judgment . I was dealing with some personal stuff . ”
21387	21417	21378	21379	Mr. Freeze	1540	“ I see . Is this ‘ personal stuff ’ going to impact your ability to do your work ? Or is that too invasive of me to ask ? ”
21418	21423	21424	21424	She	548	“ It will not . ”
21448	21456	21444	21444	I	1454	“ I ’m glad to hear it . ”
21489	21549	21475	21475	She	548	“ I caught Elliot having sex with another woman . I was angry . I guess I wanted to prove something to myself … that I was still attractive or whatever . I know how dumb that sounds . I do n’t expect you to understand . It was reckless and completely unprofessional . It wo n’t happen again . ”
21622	21631	21620	21620	her	548	“ I ’m sorry that happened to you . ”
21641	21663	21620	21620	her	548	“ Friday night , we scratched an itch . It ’s done , and we can put it behind us now . ”
21664	21668	21603	21603	she	548	“ Behind us . ”
21669	21721	21736	21736	She	548	“ You made the point we do n’t know each other very well . If we did , you ’d know I ’m not interested in a relationship . You ’re quite safe , Miss Winthrop . I have no intention of holding it against you or expecting a repeat performance . ”
21776	21792	21768	21768	she	548	“ Thank you for that . I ’m lucky you ’re such an understanding guy . ”
21793	21800	21801	21801	I	1454	“ I ’m not a guy . ”
21806	21826	21801	21801	I	1454	“ I look forward to seeing your art . In the meantime , I ’ve got work to do . ”
21851	21858	21832	21832	she	548	“ Now you own the place . ”
21896	21907	21832	21832	she	548	“ How long has it been since we renovated it ? ”
21908	21911	21912	21912	Daisy	446	“ We ? ”
21918	21933	21912	21912	Daisy	446	“ Let ’s see … I had just finished college , so five years ? ”
21934	21940	21941	21941	We	562	“ I ’ve lost track . ”
22053	22063	22045	22045	Daisy	446	“ Is n’t it funny how things come around ? ”
22064	22076	22045	22045	Daisy	446	“ I still do n’t care for grand millennial or country . ”
22095	22104	22085	22085	I	1454	“ I ’m glad you rethought this blunder . ”
22105	22114	22131	22131	She	446	“ Miles said my interior design was inspired . ”
22115	22130	22131	22131	She	446	“ Miles thinks you ’re an angel descended from design heaven , poor man . ”
22163	22185	22085	22085	I	1454	“ Do n’t try to fool me with that icy exterior . I ’ve seen behind the curtain , Mr. Freeze . ”
22186	22194	22195	22195	I	1454	“ Will I ever shake that nickname ? ”
22205	22214	22195	22195	I	1454	“ You could try being a little nicer . ”
22215	22222	22085	22085	I	1454	“ I value honesty above all . ”
22223	22254	22085	22085	I	1454	“ I did n’t say be dishonest . Remember when you gave Ms. Nelly your prized Fenton art glass to complete her collection ? That was very thawed of you . ”
22255	22272	22195	22195	I	1454	“ It was a loan . You said I ’d get it back when she dies . ”
22291	22296	22288	22288	I	1454	“ Where are they ? ”
22297	22301	22085	22085	I	1454	“ Football practice . ”
22302	22306	22307	22307	I	1454	“ Of course . ”
22315	22339	22307	22307	I	1454	“ So a gala ? Just like that , out of nowhere ? You hate big events . What ’s behind all this ? ”
22340	22344	22345	22345	I	1454	“ Link Sherlock . ”
22382	22390	22391	22391	Her	446	“ The YouTuber ? He ’s hilarious ! ”
22405	22419	22396	22396	she	446	“ ‘ Finding treasures wherever they may hide … ’ I love him . ”
22420	22438	22396	22396	she	446	“ Miles is very threatened by him . Thinks he ’s going to steal all our clients . ”
22439	22449	22396	22396	she	446	“ Why do n’t you join forces with him ? ”
22450	22464	22396	22396	she	446	“ I ca n’t think of anything worse . I prefer my idea . ”
22465	22469	22396	22396	she	446	“ Which was ? ”
22470	22474	22396	22396	she	446	“ Ignore him . ”
22475	22483	22484	22484	She	446	“ You ca n’t ignore the future . ”
22505	22527	22528	22528	She	446	“ Speaking of , what happened to that ambitious young woman who dreamed of traveling and taking over the southeast region ? ”
22538	22551	22528	22528	She	446	“ She grew up to be happier than she ever dreamed possible . ”
22568	22575	22562	22562	she	446	“ Well , good for her . ”
22576	22591	22528	22528	She	446	“ You could always tell Miles no . He ’s not your boss anymore . ”
22592	22619	22562	22562	she	446	“ He does n’t have a lot of excitement in his life . I ’ll let him have his fun if it saves me a trip . ”
22620	22649	22562	22562	she	446	“ Good thing , because we ’ve spent the last two weeks busting our asses . We might set a record on fastest gala assembly in recorded history . ”
22650	22657	22658	22658	She	446	“ Always the over - achiever . ”
22666	22688	22658	22658	She	446	“ I ’m actually looking forward to it . I have n’t been to a big party since I got married . ”
22689	22694	22695	22695	She	446	“ There you go . ”
22704	22756	22695	22695	She	446	“ You ’re an old softie , but do n’t worry , I wo n’t tell anybody . Now get to the hotel . I reserved the executive suite with a view of the water for you . It ’s coastal chic , not a quilt or a doily in sight . ”
22757	22781	22658	22658	She	446	“ I remember it from your wedding . The northeastern crew will adore it . They ’ll think they ’re in the Hamptons . ”
22782	22800	22801	22801	I	1454	“ We ’ll take them all to the Tuna Tiki to remind them where they really are . ”
22822	22829	22817	22817	I	1454	“ They have very good sushi . ”
22830	22834	22835	22835	Daisy	446	“ Thank you ! ”
22840	22859	22835	22835	Daisy	446	“ One of these days , you ’re going to stop being such an old fuddy - duddy . ”
22860	22901	22817	22817	I	1454	“ If you ’re implying I do n’t know how to have fun , you know that ’s wrong . I do n’t care for places where I ’ll be vomited on or have draft beer spilled down my back . ”
22902	22913	22835	22835	Daisy	446	“ I told you not to wear your best blazer . ”
22914	22922	22923	22923	We	577	“ I do n’t own cheap clothes . ”
22935	22960	22923	22923	We	577	“ We ’ll have to find you some play clothes , Captain Von Trapp . I think I have an old pair of drapes — ”
22961	22978	22817	22817	I	1454	“ I ’ll see you in the ballroom in the morning . In appropriate work attire . ”
22979	22995	22835	22835	Daisy	446	“ Thanks for agreeing to help out . I know it ’s not your thing . ”
22996	23002	22923	22923	We	577	“ I do n’t mind . ”
23003	23012	22923	22923	We	577	“ You ’re a good man , Spence . ”
23025	23036	23018	23018	I	1454	“ I ’m an asshole . Do n’t forget it . ”
23040	23046	23047	23047	I	1454	“ Hold it right there . ”
23072	23076	23077	23077	he	128	“ Hurry up , ”
23080	23089	23077	23077	he	128	“ I ca n’t hold it much longer . ”
23230	23235	23236	23236	he	128	“ That feels good , ”
23239	23264	23236	23236	he	128	“ Why is n’t Scout here ? You ca n’t help me with that old injury . It ’s only going to get worse . ”
23265	23276	23277	23277	He	128	“ The Quarterback Princess has a daddy - daughter tea . ”
23380	23402	23372	23372	He	130	“ You ’ll be the same way in a few years , once Sunny is big enough to run and play . ”
23418	23421	23422	23422	John	130	“ Yeah . ”
23486	23496	23497	23497	Spencer	621	“ Joselyn , would you mind … a moment ? ”
23569	23576	23577	23577	He	130	“ What ’s going on here ? ”
23590	23629	23577	23577	He	130	“ We ’re assembling the framework for the sculptures . I need someone to hold the metal beams so I can create a skeleton , then I ’ll cover it with floral wire and thread the flowers through — ”
23630	23636	23637	23637	Spencer	621	“ Is n’t he married ? ”
23649	23661	23637	23637	Spencer	621	“ Yes , with two kids . Why do you ask ? ”
23662	23669	23577	23577	He	130	“ You were flirting with him . ”
23670	23675	23676	23676	My	1454	“ I was not ! ”
23692	23700	23701	23701	Spencer	621	“ I was not flirting with him . ”
23714	23737	23701	23701	Spencer	621	“ I ’ll help you assemble the frames . He can do something else . Or better yet , send him home . ”
23807	23812	23813	23813	Bruce	132	“ Hey , Sly . ”
23819	23841	23813	23813	Bruce	132	“ It ’s been a while since you made one of these things . I thought you ’d given it up . ”
23842	23856	23857	23857	I	1454	“ Just when I thought I was out , they pulled me back . ”
23870	23887	23888	23888	He	133	“ Ca n’t wait to see the finished product . You always knock my socks off . ”
23909	23931	23932	23932	Ice	134	“ Hey , you ’re off the hook . You should head home and put a heating pad on your back . ”
23940	23949	23932	23932	Ice	134	“ I can help you a little longer . ”
23950	23985	23992	23992	I	1454	“ And I really appreciate it , but I do n’t want to be in the doghouse for breaking your back . You ’ve got babies to carry now . Spencer will help me . ”
24008	24018	24019	24019	He	128	“ You ’re still a badass with a blowtorch . ”
24034	24039	24040	24040	He	128	“ Thanks , babe . ”
24097	24113	24088	24088	I	1454	“ I do n’t know why you ’re frowning . I did what you said . ”
24114	24128	24129	24129	I	1454	“ Good girl . Now , what do you need me to hold ? ”
24167	24174	24175	24175	Ollie	374	“ Aunt Sly ! Aunt Sly ! ”
24189	24198	24199	24199	Spencer	621	“ Look at all the crickets I found ! ”
24203	24211	24199	24199	Spencer	621	“ How do you get anything done ? ”
24212	24215	24216	24216	I	1454	“ Magic . ”
24272	24281	24282	24282	Oliver	374	“ Chartreuse is going to be so fat ! ”
24290	24296	24282	24282	Oliver	374	“ Just look at them . ”
24297	24311	24322	24322	they	598	“ That is really gross , Olls . Let me check that thing . ”
24358	24369	24370	24370	I	1454	“ Do n’t let those get loose in the house . ”
24376	24393	24370	24370	I	1454	“ Mom will have a cow , and I ’ll have to sleep in my van . ”
24394	24423	24424	24424	He	128	“ Ms. Regina said she likes Chartreuse . She held her and let her climb onto her shoulder and everything ! We almost lost her in her hair ! ”
24453	24469	24433	24433	I	1454	“ You should be a props master for Indiana Jones movies when you get big . ”
24470	24477	24478	24478	Ollie	374	“ What ’s a props master ? ”
24483	24488	24478	24478	Ollie	374	“ It sounds cool ! ”
24489	24514	24433	24433	I	1454	“ It ’s right up your alley , froggy boy . Tons of bugs and snakes and alligators . Have you finished your homework ? ”
24515	24521	24522	24522	he	128	“ Yes , Aunt Sly , ”
24612	24624	24605	24605	she	414	“ What if you traded in your frog for a dog ? ”
24625	24635	24636	24636	He	374	“ Mom said we ca n’t afford a dog . ”
24675	24689	24660	24660	I	1454	“ I ca n’t look at those eyes . They ’re too big . ”
24690	24696	24697	24697	Ollie	374	“ They help her eat . ”
24706	24723	24697	24697	Ollie	374	“ She pulls them in to swallow , and they shove the food down her neck . ”
24724	24729	24660	24660	I	1454	“ That ’s disgusting . ”
24730	24760	24697	24697	Ollie	374	“ Did you know the males ride on the females ’ backs during mating season ? That way they can fertilize the eggs as soon as they ’re laid . ”
24761	24767	24768	24768	I	1454	“ That sounds about right . ”
24810	24826	24801	24801	his	621	“ I need to get back to work . Stay out of trouble , okay ? ”
24827	24835	24801	24801	his	621	“ I ’m going to feed Chartreuse . ”
24836	24846	24847	24847	I	1454	“ Do n’t lose her . Or her eyes . ”
24864	24888	24854	24854	Spencer	621	“ Sorry . Feeding time at the zoo . Did you know that species of tree frog has been around ten million years ? ”
24889	24892	24893	24893	He	621	“ Fascinating . ”
24909	24917	24893	24893	He	621	“ Why is n’t he in school ? ”
24918	24929	24930	24930	I	1454	“ That ’s not really your business , is it ? ”
24954	24967	24947	24947	His	621	“ You ’re my business as long as you work for me . ”
24990	25036	24984	24984	I	1454	“ His dad ’s kind of a rough guy . He ’s been threatening to take Ollie from his mother , so I told her I ’d keep him with me — in case he shows up again . She ’ll be here Friday night . ”
25037	25046	24984	24984	I	1454	“ That sounds dangerous . Is she okay ? ”
25047	25070	24984	24984	I	1454	“ I think so . I call her every day to be sure . She said she ’s got it under control . ”
25071	25076	25077	25077	His	604	“ I hope so . ”
25137	25147	25148	25148	He	604	“ I like this look you ’re doing here . ”
25172	25182	25164	25164	I	1454	“ Thanks . I was feeling playful this morning . ”
25183	25190	25211	25211	he	604	“ It ’s cute , Rosie . ”
25191	25196	25197	25197	My	1454	“ Puppies are cute . ”
25373	25386	25387	25387	He	604	“ This gives new meaning to the phrase ‘ fiery redhead . ’ ”
25400	25410	25387	25387	He	604	“ Who taught you to do all of this ? ”
25411	25426	25440	25440	He	604	“ Shop teacher at school . I ’m the only girl who took welding . ”
25427	25439	25440	25440	He	604	“ You ’re a welder . Daisy ’s daughter plays football . ”
25458	25468	25440	25440	He	604	“ I take it your family enjoys busting stereotypes . ”
25469	25499	25440	25440	He	604	“ We ’re descended from a long line of witches . Do n’t piss me off or I ’ll turn you into a frog and give you to Ollie . ”
25500	25511	25512	25512	He	604	“ I was wondering where he got his little pet . ”
25530	25542	25521	25521	I	1454	“ Must be nice to dispose of your enemies so cleanly . ”
25543	25549	25550	25550	I	1454	“ It has its moments . ”
25572	25579	25556	25556	he	604	“ Up next is this stuff ? ”
25580	25647	25521	25521	I	1454	“ Yep . I ’ll drape it over the frames and fasten it with the clear zip ties . Then I ’ll smooth the flower food and dirt and moss paste on the outside . Once that ’s done , I ’ll thread the flowers through the netting . I ’ll wait until Friday morning so it ’ll be as fresh as possible on Saturday night . ”
25648	25655	25556	25556	he	604	“ How long does it last ? ”
25656	25701	25556	25556	he	604	“ As long as they water it . The paste keeps the flowers hydrated , and I try to select ones that hold up well after cutting . Roses are the worst , but we have to have roses for Beauty and the Beast . ”
25702	25707	25521	25521	I	1454	“ Why is that ? ”
25708	25757	25758	25758	Hazel	140	“ The rose is Beast ’s countdown clock . As each petal falls , the time runs out for him to learn to love Belle and earn her love in return . If he does n’t before the last one falls , he ’ll be a beast forever . ”
25843	25849	25839	25839	We	611	“ Does he make it ? ”
25858	25879	25880	25880	His	604	“ In the movie he does . Just barely , though . Belle shows up in time to save him . ”
25894	25903	25887	25887	he	604	“ What about the non - Disney version ? ”
25904	25919	25887	25887	he	604	“ I do n’t know . I like the Disney version of the story . ”
25920	25934	25935	25935	He	604	“ Probably best to get the whole truth before believing in fairy tales . ”
25945	25965	25935	25935	He	604	“ I think you ’ve got it from here . Let me know if you need any more help . ”
25966	25979	25988	25988	he	604	“ Scout ’s coming to help me tomorrow . Thanks , though . ”
26051	26063	26064	26064	Daisy	446	“ Three love boat platters and two pitchers of Natty Light . ”
26113	26125	26101	26101	I	1454	“ I ’m going to the bar . Want a martini ? ”
26137	26147	26132	26132	she	446	“ Please . I ca n’t drink Natural Light . ”
26558	26583	26584	26584	Scout	536	“ Sly , remember when we were shearing that topiary back in high school , and you sliced the top layer off your finger ? ”
26593	26598	26584	26584	Scout	536	“ There it is . ”
26599	26603	26604	26604	Joselyn	177	“ Stop it ! ”
26616	26624	26604	26604	Joselyn	177	“ You ’re ruining my tuna nigiri ! ”
26625	26638	26639	26639	He	177	“ Who knew there was so much blood in the old girl ? ”
26670	26678	26679	26679	Daisy	446	“ No blood talk at the table . ”
26712	26715	26716	26716	She	446	“ Yes ! ”
26730	26742	26743	26743	She	446	“ It ’s delicious . I ’m going to savor it . ”
26770	26778	26764	26764	I	1454	“ What ’s this about your finger ? ”
26806	26841	26789	26789	She	446	“ This one . Almost sliced it right off with my pruning shears . It must ’ve bled for an hour . I thought I was going to pass out . Ten stitches later … ”
26865	26877	26878	26878	She	446	“ So these sculptures have always been hazardous to your health ? ”
26892	26903	26878	26878	She	446	“ I knew I stopped doing this for a reason . ”
26919	26932	26933	26933	Her	446	“ Brushes with death and dismemberment aside , you ’re an artist . ”
26949	26955	26939	26939	she	446	“ Thank you , Spencer . ”
26956	26970	26939	26939	she	446	“ Where ’s your little charge this evening ? No sushi for him ? ”
26971	27003	26939	26939	she	446	“ He ’s actually hanging out with JR ’s son this evening . They played on a little football team together one summer , and they ’ve been friends ever since . ”
27004	27009	26939	26939	she	446	“ And his mother ? ”
27010	27061	27062	27062	I	1454	“ Courtney should be here tomorrow afternoon . She said it ’s been a pretty quiet week , so that ’s good news . It ’s really nice of you to ask … and a little surprising . Most people do n’t want to talk about that kind of thing . ”
27083	27101	27070	27070	I	1454	“ I try to know my employees ’ situations . Especially if it might impact your performance . ”
27102	27110	27148	27149	the singer	633	“ I told you it would n’t . ”
27152	27158	27148	27149	the singer	633	“ Red , Red Wine . ”
27178	27185	27186	27186	Scout	536	“ I did n’t do it , ”
27194	27199	27186	27186	Scout	536	“ Scout ’s honor . ”
27200	27208	27209	27209	Joselyn	177	“ You did not just say that , ”
27240	27245	27246	27246	he	177	“ Hello , friends ! ”
27249	27271	27246	27246	he	177	“ Hello , Spencer ! Daisy , I played this song just for you . I heard it ’s your favorite . ”
27296	27322	27288	27288	she	446	“ Miles , I ’m so glad you made it . Did you just get in town ? Have some sushi . There ’s plenty . ”
27323	27329	27330	27330	Scout	536	“ We have to dance . ”
27340	27351	27330	27330	Scout	536	“ Miles played this song just for you , Tink . ”
27352	27358	27359	27359	I	1454	“ Miles has impeccable timing , ”
27373	27392	27364	27364	She	446	“ I do n’t know why Daisy hates this song so much . It ’s not that bad . ”
27393	27399	27330	27330	Scout	536	“ It ’s that bad . ”
27400	27417	27418	27418	Her	446	“ What ’s funny is the way she gets so bent out of shape about it . ”
27437	27442	27432	27432	I	1454	“ Want to dance ? ”
27459	27462	27464	27464	her	446	“ Sure . ”
27622	27635	27636	27636	Her	446	“ You seem to make a habit of flirting with married men . ”
27640	27651	27636	27636	Her	446	“ I ’m sorry ? What did you just say ? ”
27652	27664	27665	27665	She	446	“ Yesterday it was John . Today , it ’s Scout … ”
27693	27702	27684	27684	her	446	“ I ’m not flirting with married men . ”
27718	27726	27712	27712	her	446	“ That ’s not how it appears . ”
27754	27758	27759	27759	she	446	“ I see , ”
27762	27767	27759	27759	she	446	“ You ’re jealous . ”
27768	27809	27759	27759	she	446	“ Jealousy is never a good look on anyone . You wo n’t see it on me . I just think as someone who has experienced the pain of infidelity , you would n’t want to inflict it on others . ”
27818	27825	27759	27759	she	446	“ You are such an ass — ”
27826	27834	27759	27759	she	446	“ Yes , I ’ve been told . ”
27835	27893	27759	27759	she	446	“ For your information , Scout and I grew up together . He ’s like a brother to me . I introduced him to Daisy when we were in high school , because they ’re perfect for each other . I practically shoved them into each other ’s arms . I have no interest in him romantically . ”
27894	27898	27899	27899	I	1454	“ Or JR ? ”
27928	27937	27915	27915	she	621	“ I stopped crushing on JR years ago . ”
27938	27943	27915	27915	she	621	“ Are you sure ? ”
27944	27950	27915	27915	she	621	“ Why do you care ? ”
27951	27956	27957	27957	Her	621	“ I do n’t . ”
27966	28000	27962	27962	she	621	“ When he got married , those feelings went away . I ’m not a cheater . I never have been . I ’m honest , and I respect other people ’s feelings . ”
28135	28141	28122	28122	I	1454	“ You ’re different here . ”
28142	28146	28153	28153	Her	621	“ Am I ? ”
28147	28152	28153	28153	Her	621	“ You laugh more . ”
28167	28191	28161	28161	I	1454	“ It ’s my home . I ’m with people I ’ve known all my life . It ’s familiar , I guess . ”
28192	28201	28122	28122	I	1454	“ So why do n’t you move back ? ”
28202	28208	28209	28209	Her	621	“ You sound like Daisy . ”
28214	28255	28209	28209	Her	621	“ I have no interest in moving back to the low - key , ‘ What are you going to do with your life ? ’ all the time . No thanks , I ’d rather have a root canal . ”
28256	28264	28161	28161	I	1454	“ Is this coming from your mother ? ”
28265	28336	28161	28161	I	1454	“ It comes from everybody . They ’re all wonderful when I ’m here for a visit , but if I stay too long , it turns into nonstop pressure to either get married and have kids or to be the best whatever at whatever . No resting on your laurels in Fireside . It ’s much easier to leave and be a failure than to stay and simply exist . ”
28339	28347	28348	28348	She	621	“ How old are you , Joselyn ? ”
28362	28369	28348	28348	She	621	“ I ’m twenty - five . ”
28370	28391	28442	28442	she	621	“ You ’re hardly old enough to be a failure at anything . Maybe they ’re excited for your potential . ”
28392	28409	28442	28442	she	621	“ You could n’t possibly understand . You ’ve never had to work to prove yourself . ”
28417	28436	28437	28437	Her	621	“ You have no idea what my life has been like . No one gets a free ride . ”
28447	28463	28442	28442	she	621	“ I keep forgetting I do n’t know anything about you . I ’m sorry . ”
28485	28490	28491	28491	She	621	“ No harm done . ”
28497	28509	28491	28491	She	621	“ After Saturday , you wo n’t be my boss anymore . ”
28510	28525	28527	28527	my	1454	“ It ’s true . It will be the end of our professional relationship . ”
28541	28548	28533	28533	I	1454	“ What will you do then ? ”
28549	28561	28491	28491	She	621	“ Back to building my client list , pounding the pavement . ”
28562	28577	28491	28491	She	621	“ If you need help , I write a pretty decent letter of recommendation . ”
28578	28620	28533	28533	I	1454	“ I do n’t know if a florist rec will help me , but if you know anyone who needs massage therapy or sports medicine , be sure to send them my way . Or if you ever need it yourself . ”
28621	28631	28632	28632	She	621	“ Done . I like having you under me . ”
28639	28648	28632	28632	She	621	“ That ’s not how I remember it . ”
28720	28794	28795	28795	Her	621	“ You ’re right . We do n’t know each other well , but I believe you ’re an intelligent person . At least , it appears your memory functions properly . In my office I told you I do n’t do relationships . To be completely clear going forward , what I meant is I do n’t sleep with the same woman more than once . I do fucking . Nothing more . ”
28803	28818	28795	28795	Her	621	“ You do fucking . Now , where have I heard that line before ? ”
28819	28879	28795	28795	Her	621	“ I ’m sure you ’ve seen it in a movie or you ’ve read it in a book , and you think I ’m not serious or it ’s just a line . Or somehow your magic pussy will change my mind and make me grow a heart or some other form of attachment . It wo n’t . ”
28880	28892	28795	28795	Her	621	“ That sounds both very lonely and very risky to me . ”
28893	28911	28795	28795	Her	621	“ I do n’t take risks , and I ’m never alone unless I want to be . ”
28912	28950	28795	28795	Her	621	“ I see . Just out of curiosity , why do you find it necessary to have such a rule ? I ’m open to a little no - strings - attached sex every now and then . ”
28951	29019	28795	28795	Her	621	“ Ah , but you see , if I ever break my rule , if I ever fuck the same woman twice , suddenly she forgets what I just said . She thinks it happened — her magic pussy has broken the spell , and I ’ve changed my evil ways . That ’s when it all becomes very messy . I also do n’t do messes . ”
29020	29028	29029	29029	She	647	“ You almost sound proud of yourself . ”
29051	29062	29037	29037	I	1454	“ I also told you before , I ’m honest . ”
29063	29074	29079	29079	her	647	“ Then it sounds like I ’m wasting your time . ”
29112	29126	29105	29105	I	1454	“ Thank you for the dance , Joselyn . Have a good evening . ”
29140	29151	29152	29152	Courtney	414	“ I ’ve got to say , I ’m impressed . ”
29174	29181	29182	29182	Ollie	374	“ Aunt Sly used a blowtorch ! ”
29211	29226	29198	29198	I	1454	“ She ’d put it on the metal and Boosh ! Sparks flew everywhere ! ”
29227	29247	29248	29248	I	1454	“ I told him not to look at the flame . You did what I said , right Olls ? ”
29277	29289	29269	29269	Courtney	414	“ How did you ever learn to do all of this ? ”
29302	29345	29346	29346	She	414	“ I mostly taught myself . You ’d be surprised what you can learn on YouTube . Then I took some welding classes at school , and I talked to different florists to get advice on which flowers work best in topiaries . ”
29351	29367	29346	29346	She	414	“ I ca n’t believe you did it all by yourself . And so fast ! ”
29368	29384	29385	29386	The asshole	648	“ JR and Scout helped me with the framing — and Spencer , I guess . ”
29402	29435	29388	29388	I	1454	“ I ’m nowhere near done . Once I ’m finished with these final roses , I have to make all the arrangements for the tables . Being a florist is work . ”
29436	29444	29445	29445	Court	414	“ Hold up , back it up . ”
29454	29470	29471	29471	Ollie	374	“ Did I hear you say Spencer helped you ? Mr. Brown Chicken Brown Cow ? ”
29488	29495	29471	29471	Ollie	374	“ I ’m out of here . ”
29507	29517	29496	29496	I	1454	“ I guess he knows about everything by now . ”
29518	29563	29598	29598	she	424	“ To answer your question , yes . Spencer helped me , and we ’ve been very professional . No funny business at all . In fact , I have it straight from the horse ’s mouth we will not be revisiting his bedroom . ”
29564	29573	29574	29574	she	424	“ Eh , so you ’ll visit yours , ”
29577	29590	29574	29574	she	424	“ Mr. Carrollton says he never sleeps with the same woman twice . ”
29612	29618	29598	29598	she	424	“ That ’s strangely sucky . ”
29801	29837	29796	29796	I	1454	“ Fuck Spencer Carrollton . This will all be over tomorrow night , and I can get on with my life . I ’m not wasting any more time running down dead - end roads . ”
29838	29844	29845	29845	Courtney	414	“ That ’s the spirit . ”
29852	29864	29845	29845	Courtney	414	“ How about you ? Any word from Ozzy this week ? ”
29865	29886	29796	29796	I	1454	“ Not a peep . Maybe he ’s decided to leave us alone finally . I can hope , right ? ”
29914	29961	29900	29900	I	1454	“ We ’re going to do more than hope . We ’re going to find some good men , not abusers or icebergs who only want to screw around and wreck our lives . They ’re out there , and we ’re going to find them . ”
29962	29965	29969	29969	I	1454	“ Preach ! ”
29983	30002	30003	30003	She	414	“ Hey , Court , hand me two more of those roses , and I ’ll be done . ”
30040	30046	30047	30047	She	414	“ Where is he now ? ”
30068	30073	30074	30074	Spencer	621	“ Where is who ? ”
30101	30106	30107	30107	My	1454	“ Oh , shit ! ”
30118	30123	30107	30107	My	1454	“ No … NO ! ”
30194	30199	30200	30200	Courtney	414	“ Oh my God ! ”
30203	30206	30207	30207	Spencer	621	“ Joselyn ! ”
30257	30260	30252	30252	I	1454	“ NO ! ”
30330	30337	30311	30311	He	621	“ Sly , oh my God ! ”
30366	30371	30372	30372	Spencer	621	“ Dammit , Sin . ”
30378	30383	30384	30384	Courtney	414	“ Are you hurt ? ”
30406	30411	30412	30412	I	1454	“ I ’m okay , ”
30475	30480	30458	30458	Spencer	621	“ Look at me . ”
30504	30511	30491	30491	He	621	“ Are you dizzy ? Nauseated ? ”
30512	30515	30516	30516	I	1454	“ No … ”
30541	30550	30551	30551	Courtney	414	“ You saved me . You saved everything . ”
30560	30592	30551	30551	Courtney	414	“ You did some pretty impressive acrobatics getting away from it . It ’s more like you saved the flowers . He saved your head from splatting all over the floor . ”
30603	30608	30609	30609	he	621	“ That does it , ”
30612	30629	30609	30609	he	621	“ No more sculptures without a safety net … and a football helmet and metal gloves . ”
30644	30655	30633	30633	I	1454	“ Now I remember why I stopped doing these things . ”
30656	30664	30665	30665	His	621	“ They ’re hazardous to your health . ”
30696	30704	30689	30689	I	1454	“ Thank you for saving my life . ”
30705	30708	30709	30709	Daisy	446	“ Sly ? ”
30719	30730	30709	30709	Daisy	446	“ What the hell — Spencer ? Are you okay ? ”
30731	30736	30737	30737	Spencer	621	“ Can you stand ? ”
30775	30779	30763	30763	Daisy	446	“ What happened ? ”
30780	30786	30787	30787	I	1454	“ Oh , you know , ”
30792	30808	30809	30809	Her	446	“ The usual Sly - near - death - experience on a bed of roses . ”
30821	30829	30816	30816	Spencer	621	“ She ’s going to be okay . ”
30830	30844	30845	30845	Scout	536	“ Whoa , what the hell ? What did I miss this time ? ”
30861	30867	30845	30845	Scout	536	“ I ’m really fine . ”
30925	30932	30933	30933	I	1454	“ Spencer , are you okay ? ”
30953	30959	30960	30960	His	621	“ Did I break something ? ”
30970	30984	30985	30985	He	621	“ No , it ’s fine . I ’m just catching my breath . ”
30991	31010	31011	31011	Scout	536	“ Is it your ribs ? Ribs ca n’t really be fixed , but we can tape them . ”
31022	31029	31030	31030	Spencer	621	“ It ’s not my ribs . ”
31036	31058	31030	31030	Spencer	621	“ It ’s an old injury . I tweaked my back playing racquetball with Miles . I probably irritated the muscle . ”
31059	31089	31090	31090	Scout	536	“ If that ’s the case , Sly can help you . She got her degree in sports medicine , massage therapy . Give him the works , Sly . ”
31099	31124	31090	31090	Scout	536	“ I ’m glad to check you out . We can do it here or at my mom ’s … Wherever you feel comfortable . ”
31125	31174	31182	31182	he	536	“ I ’m going to head up to my room and see if I can treat it with ice and heat . I ’ve got a nice jacuzzi tub . If none of that works , I ’ll let you know . I ’m glad you ’re okay . ”
31226	31234	31235	31235	Scout	536	“ That guy is such a dick . ”
31248	31267	31235	31235	Scout	536	“ That man just saved my life — and the centerpiece for the gala . Show some respect . ”
31268	31277	31278	31278	I	1454	“ Ow — don’t hit me , witch . ”
31316	31321	31322	31322	She	446	“ Okay , kids … ”
31330	31361	31322	31322	She	446	“ I ’m glad you ’re okay . If Spencer ’s down for the count , I need you to help me greet our guests . You up for it ? ”
31374	31391	31362	31362	I	1454	“ I ’ve got to find my lost boy . Do what you need to do . ”
31432	31438	31439	31439	Spencer	621	“ Ca n’t you read ? ”
31445	31467	31439	31439	Spencer	621	“ Assuming you ca n’t , I ’ll read it for you . It says , ‘ Do not disturb . ’ ”
31640	31645	31646	31646	I	1454	“ It does not . ”
31653	31670	31646	31646	I	1454	“ It ’s much more polite . It says , ‘ Please do not disturb . ’ ”
31696	31699	31700	31700	he	621	“ Joselyn , ”
31703	31710	31700	31700	he	621	“ What are you doing here ? ”
31711	31716	31717	31717	I	1454	“ You ’re hurt . ”
31731	31748	31717	31717	I	1454	“ Why did n’t you say something ? Why are you such a stubborn old mule ? ”
31749	31761	31762	31762	His	621	“ I ’m hardly old . I ’m thirty - two . ”
31767	31774	31762	31762	His	621	“ It ’s a good thing . ”
31789	31807	31780	31780	I	1454	“ You ’re far more likely to heal faster at your age than if you were older . ”
31808	31823	31717	31717	I	1454	“ If I were younger , I would n’t be lying here at all . ”
31824	31881	31882	31882	He	621	“ Spilled milk . You saved my life and the entire gala , and now you ’re lying up here suffering for it , and you wo n’t let anybody help you . It ’s ridiculous and prideful . I brought my bag , and I ’m going to work out that injury . Right now . ”
31900	31921	31882	31882	He	621	“ Is that so ? Who died and made you queen ? How did you get in this room anyway ? ”
31922	31943	31944	31944	He	621	“ Daisy gave me your extra key . Now you ’re going to be still and let me help you . ”
32114	32121	32102	32102	I	1454	“ Just relax and stop fighting . ”
32127	32135	32136	32136	His	1454	“ What are you going to do ? ”
32169	32184	32158	32158	I	1454	“ Lucky for you , I ’m actually very good at treating sports injuries . ”
32254	32266	32267	32267	I	1454	“ I ’m going to put my hands on your back . ”
32276	32314	32315	32315	He	1454	“ Now , I ’m just going to work out the tension . I ’ll slowly apply more pressure . If it ’s too intense , let me know , and I ’ll ease up . Okay ? ”
32427	32470	32421	32421	I	1454	“ I think the strain is located in your gluteus medius . That ’s the muscle that wraps around your left hip . Is it okay if I get closer there ? I ’ll need to manipulate the top of your butt — ”
32471	32480	32487	32487	I	1454	“ You have permission to touch my ass . ”
32554	32563	32564	32564	He	1454	“ Tell me if it ’s too much . ”
32654	32660	32650	32652	The better man	679	“ Are you doing okay ? ”
32670	32676	32677	32677	He	1454	“ That feels really good . ”
32734	32737	32738	32738	He	1454	“ God … ”
32741	32748	32738	32738	He	1454	“ That ’s where it is … ”
32765	32768	32751	32751	I	1454	“ Better ? ”
32769	32781	32782	32782	I	1454	“ I ’m sure it ’ll be great once you stop . ”
32795	32811	32782	32782	I	1454	“ I ca n’t tell you how grateful I am to you for saving me . ”
32812	32833	32834	32834	He	1454	“ As if I would stand there and let you crash onto the floor . You could ’ve been killed . ”
32846	32852	32834	32834	He	1454	“ It was very heroic . ”
32877	32885	32834	32834	He	1454	“ Like something out of a movie . ”
32886	32895	32896	32896	He	1454	“ Not a Disney movie , I hope . ”
32952	32957	32943	32943	He	1454	“ Maybe it was . ”
32976	32999	32972	32972	his	1454	“ Do n’t get any ideas , Joselyn . I did what I did because it was the right thing to do . ”
33032	33045	33024	33024	he	1454	“ Well , I ’m here to try and even the scales . ”
33126	33131	33132	33132	I	1454	“ What happened here ? ”
33147	33155	33143	33143	he	1454	“ Childhood injury . Leave it alone . ”
33167	33193	33143	33143	he	1454	“ Must ’ve been pretty serious to leave a scar like that . Were you cut … or hit ? Was it a car accident ? ”
33194	33202	33143	33143	he	1454	“ It ’s none of your concern . ”
33203	33230	33143	33143	he	1454	“ Actually , if you have a pre - existing injury , it can be helpful for me to know when I ’m providing future treatment . ”
33231	33245	33246	33246	He	1454	“ I wo n’t require future treatment . Thanks for the back rub . ”
33373	33415	33349	33349	I	1454	“ You might not feel so great tonight , but the healing should set in overnight . Maybe take some ibuprofen and drink plenty of water . By tomorrow , I think you ’ll feel well enough to attend the gala . ”
33416	33423	33441	33441	I	1454	“ I will attend the gala . ”
33424	33440	33441	33441	I	1454	“ Great , then I ’ll leave this with you , and here ’s this . ”
33463	33475	33476	33476	I	1454	“ You know how to reach me if you need anything . ”
33538	33549	33550	33550	Miles	78	“ You do n’t look any the worse for wear . ”
33592	33613	33581	33581	I	1454	“ It ’s not that serious — just a tweak . Besides , I could n’t miss your big event . ”
33907	33913	33903	33903	Buffett	151	“ Red , Red Wine , ”
34393	34400	34401	34402	Rick Brimfield	85	“ Spencer . Here you are . ”
34411	34419	34401	34402	Rick Brimfield	85	“ I ’ve been looking for you . ”
34420	34423	34424	34424	I	1454	“ Rick . ”
34430	34435	34424	34424	I	1454	“ You made it . ”
34461	34496	34457	34457	we	706	“ Did n’t see you at the welcome dinner last night . Let me guess , you found the only Marilyn in this tiny town and spent the night with her in your room . ”
34509	34527	34503	34503	he	85	“ Actually , I tweaked my back playing racquetball with Miles . Had to call it early . ”
34528	34532	34533	34533	He	85	“ Too bad . ”
34539	34563	34564	34564	He	85	“ This is quite impressive , but I would expect nothing less . Only … What ’s a guy to do with this ? ”
34586	34597	34598	34598	He	85	“ Give it to your wife . Where is Vanessa ? ”
34606	34614	34598	34598	He	85	“ Our divorce was finalized last week . ”
34615	34627	34564	34564	He	85	“ Rick , I ’m sorry . I had no idea . ”
34628	34680	34681	34681	My	1454	“ Yeah , fuck all that . You ’ve had the right idea all along . There are far too many hot women in the world to tie myself down to screwing only one . I plan to make up for lost time , starting now . What do you say ? ”
34748	34759	34760	34760	She	713	“ Hey , Rick , I see you found Spencer . ”
34770	34792	34760	34760	She	713	“ He was looking for you last night , Spence . I think Rick wanted to pull an all - nighter . ”
34793	34798	34799	34799	I	1454	“ A missed opportunity , ”
34808	34819	34799	34799	I	1454	“ You should have sent him out with your husband . ”
34820	34841	34842	34842	Scout	536	“ Nah , thanks , but that ’s never been my style . I ’m a one - woman guy . ”
34876	34883	34869	34869	I	1454	“ If you ’ll excuse me . ”
35039	35044	35019	35019	She	1749	“ You made it . ”
35071	35085	35053	35053	she	1749	“ How ’s the back ? Any better ? I like this tux . ”
35143	35160	35140	35140	my	1454	“ I told you I ’d be here . I ’m a man of my word . ”
35161	35164	35165	35165	Her	1749	“ Yes . ”
35178	35202	35204	35204	she	1749	“ You ’re honest and not nice at all , and you never sleep with the same woman twice . I ’m learning . ”
35291	35305	35285	35285	her	1749	“ Why are you here alone ? You should have brought a date . ”
35311	35320	35321	35321	She	1749	“ I knew I ’d be seeing you . ”
35328	35339	35321	35321	She	1749	“ How did you sleep last night ? Any pain ? ”
35340	35355	35368	35368	She	1749	“ I took an edible . I was asleep ten minutes after you left . ”
35356	35367	35368	35368	She	1749	“ Wait , are you saying you ate some weed ? ”
35398	35415	35376	35376	she	1749	“ THC is a proven anti - inflammatory pain reliever , and there ’s no hangover . ”
35433	35443	35427	35427	I	1454	“ Why did n’t you just smoke a joint ? ”
35444	35470	35471	35471	Her	1749	“ It ’s a non - smoking room , Joselyn . Anyway , I do n’t like the smell of smoke , particularly pot smoke . ”
35481	35504	35476	35476	she	1749	“ I ’m not often surprised , but you ’ve surprised me . I never expected you to be such a rebel . ”
35505	35516	35476	35476	she	1749	“ I ’ve got seven years on you , Sin . ”
35534	35546	35547	35547	She	1749	“ You ca n’t possibly know all there is to know . ”
35558	35571	35547	35547	She	1749	“ It ’s okay to be vulnerable . You ’ve been hurt . ”
35572	35629	35547	35547	She	1749	“ I do n’t do vulnerable . If I appear to be on guard , it ’s because my partner has already seen fit to slap me in the back , and I do n’t know who might try to do it next . Fucking Miles . Probably trying to ensure he wins our next match . ”
35630	35638	35547	35547	She	1749	“ Oh no ! He did n’t ! ”
35639	35643	35547	35547	She	1749	“ He did . ”
35644	35687	35688	35688	We	723	“ I ’ll get Daisy to tell him to stop hitting you in your injury . He seems to listen to her . And I ’m available for follow - up treatments . I told you I ’m rebuilding my client list . ”
35749	35764	35742	35742	She	724	“ You ’re very beautiful tonight . This white and gold combination suits you . ”
35781	35795	35771	35771	she	724	“ Thank you . I know you do n’t give out compliments freely . ”
35796	35812	35771	35771	she	724	“ Only an idiot gives out compliments freely . Or a person who wants something . ”
35813	35828	35829	35829	She	724	“ And you want nothing from me . Do n’t worry . I remember . ”
35931	35942	35922	35922	She	724	“ So you ’re saying you want to be friends ? ”
35957	36003	36004	36004	She	724	“ I ’m saying I want to treat you . I know we have a history , but I really do respect your boundaries . As your therapist , they would be my boundaries as well … and Lord knows I could use the work . ”
36019	36029	36013	36013	she	724	“ Why do you care so much , Joselyn ? ”
36054	36106	36049	36049	She	724	“ Remember that old fable about the lion who was going to eat the mouse , but in the end let him go ? Then later , when the lion had been captured by hunters , that same mouse showed up and chewed through the ropes and set the lion free ? ”
36107	36124	36013	36013	she	724	“ Everyone knows that story . I do n’t know how it applies to this situation . ”
36125	36140	36141	36141	She	724	“ No act of kindness , no matter how small , is ever wasted . ”
36150	36159	36141	36141	She	724	“ I owe you one . Or several . ”
36160	36168	36049	36049	She	724	“ I release you from your debt . ”
36169	36196	36141	36141	She	724	“ You ca n’t do that . The universe knows , and if I do n’t repay you , my karma will be all messed up . ”
36241	36255	36256	36256	She	724	“ Your position is giving me a massage is going to repay me ? ”
36267	36289	36256	36256	She	724	“ Perhaps while I ’m healing your muscles , you might let me heal whatever else is strained … or broken . ”
36290	36304	36256	36256	She	724	“ I ’m trying to decide if your suggestion is dirty or presumptive . ”
36305	36334	36256	36256	She	724	“ I ’m not being dirty at all . I ’m being serious . Maybe I can show you it ’s safe to step outside that frozen castle . ”
36335	36346	36256	36256	She	724	“ Why do I feel like this is more Disney ? ”
36347	36374	36375	36375	She	724	“ It ’s only Disney if you ’re a tiny princess with magical powers . I do n’t think that ’s the case , is it ? ”
36397	36400	36388	36388	I	1454	“ No . ”
36407	36412	36388	36388	I	1454	“ Are you angry ? ”
36487	36490	36493	36493	her	724	“ Spencer ? ”
36511	36566	36493	36493	her	724	“ Here you are . I need you to lose the scowl and show a little love to Grafton . Heather is here , but she ’s pissed because of something Rick apparently said . I think he ’s been over - served , and now he ’s hitting on all the single women . ”
36567	36574	36575	36575	I	1454	“ Get Daisy to do it , ”
36578	36582	36575	36575	I	1454	“ My back — ”
36583	36593	36594	36594	Miles	78	“ Oh , look , there he goes again . ”
36604	36623	36594	36594	Miles	78	“ Although I ’m pretty confident Daisy ’s cousin can kick his ass . She ’s a pistol . ”
36675	36686	36687	36687	Rick	85	“ Oh , hey , I see you know Spencer … ”
36696	36706	36687	36687	Rick	85	“ Wait a minute … What ’s going on ? ”
36707	36718	36719	36719	I	1454	“ Why do n’t we go and have some bread ? ”
36734	36740	36741	36741	Joselyn	177	“ What are you doing ? ”
36768	36776	36762	36762	Her	733	“ What are you doing , Joselyn ? ”
36777	36795	36796	36796	Her	733	“ What are you doing is more like it ? How dare you manhandle me this way . ”
36808	36816	36801	36801	I	1454	“ What do you want from me ? ”
36887	36917	36921	36921	she	733	“ Thank you for liking my dress . I want you to call me when you ’re ready for your next treatment . Our professional relationship is n’t over . ”
37121	37126	37107	37107	She	733	“ Joselyn , wait . ”
37157	37170	37143	37143	She	733	“ Have you decided to stop being an asshole to me now ? ”
37171	37178	37143	37143	She	733	“ I ’m going to try . ”
37179	37187	37143	37143	She	733	“ Always so honest , Mr. Carrollton . ”
37188	37209	37143	37143	She	733	“ The last time we were here , I made you an offer . Would you care to revisit it ? ”
37222	37236	37237	37237	She	733	“ You need massage therapy , and I never sleep with my clients . ”
37240	37260	37237	37237	She	733	“ I ’m not your client . I have n’t hired you , but if you want me to … ”
37288	37296	37279	37279	I	1454	“ That sounds very much like blackmail . ”
37297	37320	37325	37325	my	1454	“ Only if you ’re interested in the work . You can always say no , and I ’ll let you go . ”
37443	37446	37430	37430	She	733	“ Yes . ”
37450	37458	37459	37459	Spencer	621	“ God , I love your tits . ”
37488	37493	37481	37481	his	621	“ So fucking gorgeous . ”
37494	37497	37498	37498	I	1454	“ Spencer , ”
37545	37551	37552	37552	he	621	“ Give it to me , ”
37555	37558	37552	37552	he	621	“ Come . ”
37779	37782	37763	37763	he	621	“ Oh , ”
37789	37796	37763	37763	he	621	“ I ’ve dreamt of this . ”
37851	37856	37834	37834	his	621	“ Oh , god , ”
37970	37978	37949	37949	he	621	“ God , you feel so good . ”
38015	38019	38020	38020	I	1454	“ Fuck me … ”
38029	38035	38020	38020	I	1454	“ Please … Fuck me . ”
38036	38039	38040	38040	He	621	“ Sin … ”
38063	38067	38068	38068	My	1454	“ My girls . ”
38265	38268	38269	38269	He	621	“ Fuck … ”
38277	38283	38269	38269	He	621	“ It ’s so good . ”
38388	38400	38374	38374	His	621	“ You ’re like a little boy with his favorite toy . ”
38401	38412	38413	38413	I	1454	“ Fuck , yeah , it ’s my favorite toy . ”
38422	38447	38413	38413	I	1454	“ Have you seen how hot your rack is ? I ’d have given my left nut to hold these babies one more time . ”
38448	38451	38452	38452	I	1454	“ Mm … ”
38458	38468	38469	38469	His	621	“ I take it you ’re a boob guy . ”
38482	38519	38474	38474	he	621	“ I ’ve never really thought about it before . Until a witchy redhead waltzed into my life with a body to make any man weep and a brain sharp enough to make it all unfair . ”
38538	38555	38556	38556	Smoky	158	“ Who are you and what did you do with this asshole I know named Spencer ? ”
38573	38595	38563	38563	he	621	“ You love assholes . It ’s why I had to get you away from Rick , the recently divorced douche . ”
38596	38608	38609	38609	I	1454	“ You did n’t have to get me away from him . ”
38774	38802	38803	38803	My	1454	“ Go to sleep . I want to fuck you again before dawn . I want to fuck you until I do n’t feel this way anymore . ”
38807	38813	38814	38814	His	621	“ How do you feel ? ”
38859	38866	38840	38840	he	621	“ I feel like the Beast . ”
39103	39113	39099	39099	He	621	“ You ’re safe with me , you know ? ”
39127	39135	39119	39119	I	1454	“ No , you do n’t know . ”
39149	39158	39159	39160	My mother	254	“ I ’ve barely seen you all week . ”
39176	39187	39188	39188	My	1454	“ What the heck are you doing up so early ? ”
39195	39204	39188	39188	My	1454	“ You scared the shit out of me . ”
39205	39210	39211	39211	She	254	“ Language , Joselyn . ”
39227	39248	39188	39188	My	1454	“ Why are you doing the walk of shame ? Did n’t Daisy get you a room at the hotel ? ”
39249	39256	39211	39211	She	254	“ I told her not to . ”
39257	39266	39188	39188	My	1454	“ So where have you been all night ? ”
39267	39283	39284	39284	She	254	“ Sleeping with a random hot guy , of course . What do you think ? ”
39350	39357	39335	39335	She	251	“ I love him , Ma . ”
39371	39379	39335	39335	She	251	“ God , I ’m so stupid . ”
39380	39388	39389	39389	She	251	“ Whoa , hang on right there . ”
39400	39421	39389	39389	She	251	“ That ’s a lot of information to drop on somebody out of the blue at five in the morning . ”
39422	39429	39335	39335	She	251	“ It ’s closer to six . ”
39453	39467	39389	39389	She	251	“ Either way , start at the beginning . Who is this guy ? ”
39468	39474	39479	39479	I	1454	“ He works with Daisy . ”
39485	39512	39479	39479	I	1454	“ God , he ’s such an asshole . He ’s gorgeous and rich and he has the perfect body , and he is the worst . ”
39513	39522	39389	39389	She	251	“ And he ’s already making you cry ? ”
39523	39530	39531	39531	I	1454	“ I ’m making myself cry . ”
39540	39569	39570	39570	Her	760	“ He ’s been nothing but straight with me . He has a rule . He never sleeps with the same woman twice . Want to know why ? ”
39585	39632	39633	39633	She	760	“ Because as soon as he sleeps with a woman twice , he says she thinks her , quote , ‘ magic pussy , ’ end quote , has changed him and he ’s going to leave behind his wicked ways out of love for her . ”
39643	39652	39633	39633	She	760	“ He actually said the P - word ? ”
39676	39688	39689	39689	Her	251	“ Last night I slept with him for the second time . ”
39721	39749	39750	39750	Her	251	“ No , no , no ! That ’s the whole point . If I go there , then it ’s confirming what he said , right ? ”
39768	39808	39761	39761	she	251	“ Dang . This guy is some kind of special asshole . He ’s got it all fixed so even if he breaks his own rules , you ca n’t do anything about it or you prove him right . ”
39809	39814	39815	39815	I	1454	“ Yee - up . ”
39822	39839	39815	39815	I	1454	“ I want to strangle him … When I ’m not dreaming of having his babies . ”
39840	39847	39848	39848	My	1454	“ Is he good in bed ? ”
39859	39871	39877	39877	she	762	“ I ’ve slept with him twice , have n’t I ? ”
39884	39928	39877	39877	she	762	“ Baby , I wish I could save you , but you got that gene straight from me . They ’re always irresistible . Your father was like that . He was a smart asshole , and the smart assholes are the worst . ”
39929	39939	39940	39940	My	1454	“ You never told me Dad was an asshole ! ”
39990	40046	40047	40047	She	536	“ Your dad was a gorgeous , red - headed Scot , and I loved him from the moment he spoke to me in that accent . That man made me wet … then I discovered he was a notorious playboy , and I nearly took his head off . Then he changed his ways . ”
40083	40091	40073	40073	I	1454	“ What made him change his ways ? ”
40092	40117	40080	40080	she	536	“ I showed him I ’d walk away . He decided he ’d rather hold onto me than continue his life as a tomcat . ”
40118	40124	40125	40125	I	1454	“ You were a badass . ”
40130	40134	40125	40125	I	1454	“ A witch . ”
40135	40157	40080	40080	she	536	“ I ’m not sure if I ’m as badass as you … I seem to keep giving in to him . ”
40158	40164	40165	40165	Our	766	“ Do n’t do it . ”
40202	40234	40200	40200	Alice	251	“ Lord have mercy , Regina . One of these days I ’m just going to sit on that bottom step out there and holler until you come and get me . ”
40258	40266	40252	40252	She	251	“ What ’s the matter , Alice ? ”
40278	40281	40252	40252	She	251	“ Rheumatism ? ”
40282	40307	40308	40308	She	251	“ Old age - ism . Sly , is that you ? My goodness , you look just like a young Ann - Margret . ”
40317	40371	40308	40308	She	251	“ Elvis had a real thing for her . Almost did n’t marry Priscilla because of it . Everybody hated her for it , but she came out on top . Elvis was a big cheater , and she ’s still kicking from what I understand . Mmm … Good coffee , Reggie . ”
40372	40380	40381	40381	Ma	64	“ What brings you around so early ? ”
40399	40419	40420	40420	She	251	“ Could n’t sleep . I ca n’t sleep past five - thirty anymore — because I ’m old . ”
40427	40435	40420	40420	She	251	“ Enjoy your youth while you can . ”
40486	40500	40472	40472	her	251	“ Whoa , what ’s under your shirt here ? A back brace ? ”
40501	40504	40510	40510	she	251	“ Oh ! ”
40523	40561	40562	40562	She	251	“ Got me some of those Skims . It ’s like a stretchy girdle made out of this slick material . That little Indian girl with the good birthing hips sells ’em . How do I look ? ”
40578	40591	40569	40569	I	1454	“ You look amazing . But … Do you mean Kim Kardashian ? ”
40592	40605	40606	40606	She	251	“ That little girl who looks like Cher , except … fuller . ”
40621	40652	40606	40606	She	251	“ If you ask me , Cher always looked like she needed to eat a whole pizza all by herself . I like that little girl ’s shape . Womanly . ”
40653	40661	40662	40662	I	1454	“ Why do you think she ’s … ”
40668	40674	40662	40662	I	1454	“ She ’s actually Armenian . ”
40675	40703	40606	40606	She	251	“ Well , I do n’t care what tribe she ’s affiliated with . I believe in supporting women - owned businesses , minority - owned businesses — ”
40704	40718	40606	40606	She	251	“ I mean , she ’s not native — not that it matters . ”
40719	40730	40662	40662	I	1454	“ She ’s the same thing as Cher , right ? ”
40731	40738	40739	40740	Ms. Alice	251	“ Right , they ’re Armenian . ”
40748	40772	40739	40740	Ms. Alice	251	“ Are you telling me Cher ’s not … but she had that song where she dressed up like … and her hair … ”
40773	40786	40787	40787	She	251	“ If it helps , Armenians are still considered a minority group . ”
40805	40824	40797	40797	I	1454	“ My work here is done . I ’m going to see if I can sleep another hour . ”
40835	40842	40829	40829	I	1454	“ Sorry if I upset you . ”
40843	40866	40871	40871	I	1454	“ Do n’t be silly . I ’m going to buy some more of these girdles and help that little girl out . ”
40877	40894	40871	40871	I	1454	“ Kim Kardashian is a billionaire now . I think she ’s going to be okay . ”
40895	40903	40904	40904	She	251	“ A billionaire ! Mother of pearl ! ”
40920	40930	40931	40931	I	1454	“ Maybe I need to start making stretchy girdles . ”
40942	40970	40937	40937	she	251	“ Hey , Sly — have you seen that old book of ours ? The Fireside Women ’s Society book ? Daisy thought you might have it . ”
40988	41010	40978	40978	she	251	“ Ahh … I do n’t know . It might have gotten mixed up in my stuff . I can check . ”
41011	41058	40978	40978	she	251	“ Well , if you do , just bring it back next time you come . I do n’t want anything to happen to it . That book is a historical record . It ’s a powerful thing when women come together to help each other . ”
41059	41066	41067	41067	I	1454	“ I ’ll look for it . ”
41078	41081	41067	41067	I	1454	“ Joselyn ? ”
41091	41115	41082	41082	I	1454	“ You deserve to be treated like a queen . If he ca n’t see that , you ’re better off without him . ”
41116	41121	41122	41122	I	1454	“ Thanks , Ma . ”
41128	41148	41122	41122	I	1454	“ And thanks for helping with Ollie . I know I kind of sprung him on you this week . ”
41149	41166	41082	41082	I	1454	“ He ’s a little doll , and I love Chartreuse . What an amazing frog ! ”
41167	41172	41122	41122	I	1454	“ You ’re weird . ”
41630	41636	41637	41637	Miles	78	“ Well , it worked . ”
41649	41697	41637	41637	Miles	78	“ I just got the fall lists from our top three accounts — a month early — and Heather has granted us an exclusive first - look photoshoot of the top items from their summer auction . It ’ll be the cover of our June look book . ”
41698	41704	41705	41705	I	1454	“ Do n’t you knock ? ”
41714	41727	41728	41728	He	621	“ Antiques Today is Number 1 ! Take that , Link Sherlock . ”
41735	41747	41728	41728	He	621	“ We were never in danger of not being Number 1 . ”
41756	41762	41763	41763	His	621	“ Back still bothering you ? ”
41767	41779	41780	41780	His	621	“ I saw Miss Winthrop is on your schedule for today . ”
41789	41799	41780	41780	His	621	“ It ’s a back massage . Nothing more . ”
41800	41835	41859	41859	He	621	“ Oh , come now . You left a trail of fire in your wake when you pulled her out of the gala . Rick actually apologized to me for hitting on your girlfriend . ”
41836	41843	41859	41859	He	621	“ She ’s not my girlfriend . ”
41844	41858	41859	41859	He	621	“ Sorry , sorry … I know , no girlfriends . Only protégés . ”
41871	41893	41894	41894	He	621	“ I suppose travel is out until you ’re recovered ? No worries . I ’ll work it out with Grafton . ”
42081	42090	42072	42072	I	1454	“ Miss Winthrop is here for your appointment . ”
42091	42096	42099	42099	I	1454	“ Send her back . ”
42206	42213	42214	42214	She	789	“ Good morning , Mr. Carrollton . ”
42227	42246	42214	42214	She	789	“ How ’s the pain today ? Can you rate it on a scale of one to five ? ”
42247	42296	42297	42297	Her	789	“ First , you can call me Spencer . Let ’s not be obtuse . As for my pain , it only hurts when I move in certain directions , and then it ranges from one to five , depending on whether or not I ’m lifting something . ”
42316	42347	42310	42310	she	789	“ This is your second treatment . Based on how you feel this week , we can decide how many more are needed and the amount of time between them . ”
42411	42419	42420	42420	She	789	“ How ’s the client building going ? ”
42436	42448	42420	42420	She	789	“ Pretty slow . Would you prefer lavender oil or peppermint ? ”
42449	42461	42462	42462	She	789	“ Considering it ’s the beginning of the day , peppermint . ”
42606	42615	42616	42616	My	1454	“ Should I remove my pants as well ? ”
42637	42640	42641	42641	She	789	“ No ! ”
42649	42671	42641	42641	She	789	“ I ’ll just tuck this in your waistband . It ’ll protect your pants , and the oil is washable . ”
42672	42688	42641	42641	She	789	“ I ’d rather not walk around with oil stains on my clothes all day . ”
42689	42700	42701	42701	Hesitating	170	“ It wo n’t happen . I ’m very careful . ”
42876	42894	42873	42873	her	789	“ When you treated me in my hotel suite , you talked me through the entire procedure . ”
42895	42927	42930	42930	me	1454	“ I did n’t want you to get the wrong idea . Now that we ’ve worked together , you can sleep if you want . It does n’t bother me . ”
42932	42940	42930	42930	me	1454	“ What wrong idea would I get ? ”
42952	42966	42967	42967	She	789	“ That I was attempting to violate your rules by doing anything inappropriate . ”
42972	42992	42967	42967	She	789	“ Now you know what I ’m going to do , and I have my own rule about clients . ”
42993	42999	42967	42967	She	789	“ So I ’ve heard . ”
43082	43099	43068	43068	I	1454	“ It ’s quite a move from flowers to massage therapy . What prompted that jump ? ”
43100	43168	43170	43170	she	789	“ It ’s not such a jump if you think about it in terms of service . I ’ve always wanted to lift people ’s spirits , make them smile , or ease their suffering . Flowers led to aromatherapy and learning which scents eased anxiety and elevated the mood . That dovetailed into healing , which is how massage therapy works , and here I am . ”
43191	43199	43200	43200	Her	789	“ You need to breathe through it . ”
43334	43340	43329	43329	I	1454	“ Are we finished here ? ”
43341	43344	43345	43345	Her	789	“ Yes . ”
43356	43361	43351	43351	she	789	“ I ’m finished . ”
43374	43381	43368	43368	I	1454	“ Thank you for your time . ”
43389	43397	43368	43368	I	1454	“ I ’ll change in my bathroom . ”
43398	43407	43408	43408	She	789	“ I ’ll see you in a week . ”
43457	43470	43453	43453	She	789	“ Your payment will be in your Venmo account in the hour . ”
43471	43475	43476	43476	Her	789	“ Thank you . ”
43517	43520	43490	43490	she	789	“ stay hydrated ”
43746	43756	43757	43757	Ollie	374	“ Tree frogs can live five to nine years . ”
43859	43874	43853	43853	Ollie	374	“ Why do her eyes have to be like that ? It ’s creepy . ”
43875	43909	43910	43910	He	374	“ She uses them to scare off predators . If she were in the forest , she ’d blend with the leaves . If something gets too close , her eyes pop up . ”
43926	43932	43933	43933	I	1454	“ She ’s a freak . ”
43943	43969	43933	43933	I	1454	“ Do n’t let her get on me , okay ? If she got lost in my hair , I might have a heart attack . ”
43970	43977	43978	43978	He	374	“ She wo n’t hurt you . ”
43989	44018	43978	43978	He	374	“ People think frogs are poisonous , but they ’re not . They have toxins on their skin to protect them , but it wo n’t kill you . ”
44019	44022	44023	44023	He	374	“ Wait … ”
44043	44054	44030	44030	I	1454	“ So you ’re saying that little lady is toxic ? ”
44055	44073	44030	44030	I	1454	“ If a dog ate her , it would get sick . But it would n’t die . ”
44074	44078	44030	44030	I	1454	“ How sick ? ”
44079	44092	44093	44093	I	1454	“ Like throwing up and stuff , but it would n’t die . ”
44106	44112	44113	44113	Her	414	“ Did you know this ? ”
44124	44128	44118	44118	she	414	“ What happened ? ”
44129	44134	44118	44118	she	414	“ Chartreuse is poisonous ? ”
44135	44143	44144	44144	Court	414	“ Pfft , no she ’s not . ”
44156	44164	44144	44144	Court	414	“ Ollie , stop scaring Aunt Sly . ”
44165	44184	44185	44185	He	811	“ It ’s true , Mamma ! She wo n’t kill you , but she can protect herself ! ”
44233	44240	44250	44250	she	414	“ Hey , is something wrong ? ”
44257	44263	44250	44250	she	414	“ It ’s the usual . ”
44280	44285	44264	44264	She	414	“ He ’s back . ”
44286	44289	44290	44290	I	1454	“ Dammit , ”
44293	44315	44290	44290	I	1454	“ I ’m sorry , Court . What can we do ? Tell me . I ’ll help however I can . ”
44316	44335	44336	44336	She	414	“ You focus on getting your business back on track . I ’ll worry about my personal life . ”
44369	44376	44357	44357	I	1454	“ What happened ? Anything new ? ”
44377	44403	44336	44336	She	414	“ Oh , he ’s still going on about his son and wanting his son . I ’m scared he ’s going to try something . ”
44404	44418	44357	44357	I	1454	“ Does Ollie know what to do if he shows up at school ? ”
44419	44438	44357	44357	I	1454	“ Yeah , and I ’ve talked to his teachers . They ’re all aware of the situation . ”
44455	44474	44445	44445	her	414	“ You do n’t need this stress . I wish there was some way I could help you . ”
44483	44500	44479	44479	I	1454	“ What if we moved to a different place ? So he ca n’t find you ? ”
44501	44527	44528	44528	Her	414	“ He ’s not going to run me out of another apartment . Anyway , he ’d just find us again … He always does . ”
44535	44541	44528	44528	Her	414	“ I need a gun . ”
44569	44579	44580	44580	We	815	“ Do you know how to use a gun ? ”
44591	44596	44580	44580	We	815	“ I ’ll learn . ”
44625	44650	44619	44619	She	414	“ What if we renewed the restraining order ? You said the first one had expired … Maybe we could get a permanent one . ”
44651	44669	44670	44670	She	414	“ What good is a piece of paper if he ’s determined to get what he wants ? ”
44688	44705	44706	44706	Her	414	“ I wo n’t leave you alone . If anything , you ’ve got me here . ”
44720	44723	44724	44724	She	414	“ Thanks . ”
44729	44753	44724	44724	She	414	“ I ’ll figure it out . But enough of my shit . How did it go today with Spencer ? Any progress ? ”
44916	44933	44898	44898	he	818	“ One minute he acts like all he wants from me is s - e - x. ”
44958	44980	45021	45021	She	820	“ The next , he ’s asking questions like he wants something deeper . I feel like a yo - yo . ”
44981	45020	45021	45021	She	820	“ You are not a yo - yo . You ’re an intelligent woman with a killer bod . You could get any man you wanted , and you deserve one who will treat you like a queen . ”
45054	45059	45040	45040	I	1454	“ So are you . ”
45060	45064	45065	45065	Her	820	“ No thanks . ”
45072	45078	45065	45065	Her	820	“ I ’m off men . ”
45079	45083	45084	45084	I	1454	“ I understand , ”
45093	45111	45084	45084	I	1454	“ But I do need the money , and hell , I kind of like the guy . ”
45112	45117	45118	45118	She	820	“ You ’re screwed . ”
45155	45212	45213	45213	Her	820	“ I ’ll make us some dinner . My problems really are minor compared to yours . I ’m serious about getting that restraining order . Let ’s go tomorrow and just see what the cops say . Even if it ’s just a piece of paper , we can at least get it , right ? ”
45219	45228	45213	45213	Her	820	“ Sure . We can do that tomorrow . ”
45229	45237	45238	45238	My	1454	“ What ’s your pain level today ? ”
45322	45340	45341	45341	Spencer	621	“ I still have some discomfort when I move in particular ways , but no more fives . ”
45352	45361	45341	45341	Spencer	621	“ You ’re very good at your job . ”
45426	45443	45421	45421	I	1454	“ You ’re a quick healer . We can probably make next week our last appointment . ”
45444	45454	45421	45421	I	1454	“ Then I wo n’t be your client anymore . ”
45455	45466	45467	45467	I	1454	“ I guess we wo n’t see each other anymore . ”
45503	45519	45491	45491	He	621	“ I ’ve heard some people get regular massages just for the hell of it . ”
45528	45554	45525	45525	I	1454	“ They do . We could certainly continue along those lines . Usually it ’s a monthly type thing , but it could be biweekly . ”
45555	45565	45566	45566	Hazel	140	“ But then I ’d still be your client . ”
45572	45582	45566	45566	Hazel	140	“ I ’m not particularly happy with this arrangement . ”
45583	45593	45594	45594	My	1454	“ Lie down so I can finish . Please . ”
45645	45650	45651	45651	His	621	“ That feels good . ”
45684	45707	45675	45675	I	1454	“ I do n’t know why you ’d be tired of our arrangement . You said yourself you do n’t do relationships . ”
45968	45973	45974	45974	His	621	“ That ’s right … ”
45981	45987	45974	45974	His	621	“ You ’re so beautiful . ”
46025	46032	46033	46033	He	621	“ You make me so hard . ”
46036	46070	46033	46033	He	621	“ I want to bend you over this table and fuck you until you ca n’t walk . I want to slide my dick inside you and come all over your sweet ass . ”
46071	46074	46075	46075	My	1454	“ Spencer … ”
46087	46093	46075	46075	My	1454	“ What are you doing ? ”
46094	46104	46033	46033	He	621	“ Tell me to stop , and I will . ”
46160	46163	46164	46164	I	1454	“ Stop . ”
46206	46216	46184	46184	I	1454	“ I ’ll just pack my things and go . ”
46217	46220	46221	46221	He	825	“ Joselyn … ”
46271	46286	46261	46261	I	1454	“ You have my Venmo . I ’ll text you about your next treatment . ”
47113	47122	47103	47103	I	1454	“ I took the liberty of ordering drinks . ”
47123	47131	47132	47132	Her	634	“ I ’m not planning to stay . ”
47151	47159	47145	47145	I	1454	“ Is this about working with Courtney ? ”
47160	47188	47103	47103	I	1454	“ I will not be working with Courtney . You are my massage therapist , and you will remain so for as long as I need you . ”
47189	47203	47145	47145	I	1454	“ You said you ’d respect my boundaries , and you did n’t . ”
47204	47208	47209	47209	I	1454	“ I apologize . ”
47217	47231	47232	47232	She	847	“ I suppose I find you irresistible , for whatever that ’s worth . ”
47252	47261	47241	47241	her	847	“ Why are you the way you are ? ”
47262	47267	47232	47232	She	847	“ How am I ? ”
47268	47273	47241	47241	her	847	“ Cold , distant — ”
47274	47296	47297	47297	Her	847	“ I ’m neither of those things as you well know . I ’m realistic and in control of my emotions . ”
47309	47317	47297	47297	Her	847	“ You ca n’t be alone forever . ”
47318	47343	47241	47241	her	847	“ Why not ? I ’m not uncomfortable being on my own . I do n’t understand why others have a problem with it . ”
47344	47367	47297	47297	Her	847	“ So you just go from woman to woman , no feelings attached ? Does n’t that chip away at your soul ? ”
47368	47392	47297	47297	Her	847	“ My soul is quite well . Do n’t tell me you ’ve become one of them — thinking you can change me . ”
47393	47401	47402	47402	She	847	“ You said it ’s not possible . ”
47438	47444	47434	47434	I	1454	“ I wo n’t change . ”
47466	47480	47481	47481	I	1454	“ But it would be fun to let you try and change me . ”
47540	47551	47552	47552	Her	464	“ Do you want me to kiss you , Sin ? ”
47557	47560	47552	47552	Her	464	“ No . ”
47561	47581	47588	47588	She	464	“ We could have a lot of fun if you ’d relax your rules a bit . I did . ”
47582	47587	47588	47588	She	464	“ I said no . ”
47600	47654	47588	47588	She	464	“ Then I wo n’t . I wo n’t touch you again until you beg me for it . You ’re right , Joselyn , I do sleep with whatever woman I want , and I do n’t settle down because I ’m honest , and like you , I do n’t cheat . ”
47655	47662	47663	47663	She	464	“ And I do n’t beg . ”
47672	47731	47732	47732	She	464	“ I also do n’t have a magic pussy . I only have me , and I am a relationship girl . That wo n’t change , so we ’re wasting our time here . You can text me about your next appointment , and when we ’re together , you ’d better keep your hands to yourself . ”
47775	47789	47790	47790	Courtney	414	“ I ’m sorry , I should n’t be crying about his shit . ”
47919	47926	47932	47932	She	414	“ Tell me everything that happened . ”
47927	47931	47932	47932	She	414	“ Stupid Ozzy . ”
47945	47964	47932	47932	She	414	“ He ’s trying to scare me into coming back to him , like that ’ll ever happen . ”
47965	47974	47975	47975	I	1454	“ It looks like he was throwing things . ”
47985	47992	47975	47975	I	1454	“ What exactly did he say ? ”
47993	48029	47975	47975	I	1454	“ He said if I thought I could beat him , I was a fool . He said no friend of mine could stop him . He said no piece of paper could stop him … ”
48046	48052	48038	48038	I	1454	“ Did he do this ? ”
48074	48085	48063	48063	she	414	“ He grabbed me , but I pushed him away . ”
48086	48099	48100	48100	I	1454	“ That ’s it . We ’ve got to call the cops . ”
48114	48133	48100	48100	I	1454	“ They have to see this . They have to get it on the record and do something … ”
48134	48152	48153	48153	She	414	“ Wait , Sly … I do n’t want them coming here with Ollie in the house . ”
48162	48196	48153	48153	She	414	“ I do n’t want to scare him with the lights and all the men and the guns . We can go to the station tomorrow . He wo n’t come back tonight . ”
48238	48257	48258	48258	She	414	“ At least let me take a picture of your neck . It ’ll have faded by tomorrow . ”
48272	48284	48266	48266	I	1454	“ And you really think we ’re safe sleeping here tonight ? ”
48293	48322	48290	48290	she	414	“ He did what he came here to do — he ’s trying to scare me . Anyway , where would we go ? And Ollie ’s asleep … ”
48350	48391	48392	48392	She	414	“ We ’ll lock the deadbolt and check all the windows . I have pepper spray and a baseball bat . If we all sleep in the same room , we can keep each other safe if anything does happen . ”
48428	48438	48439	48439	she	414	“ I ’m so glad he slept through it , ”
48444	48463	48439	48439	she	414	“ I ca n’t believe I missed it . It ’s like he knows our schedules or something . ”
48525	48530	48507	48507	Courtney	414	“ Do n’t worry . ”
48546	48583	48531	48531	I	1454	“ We have strength in numbers , and we ’ll get this all sorted . I ’ll check apartment listings while we ’re at it . We ’re not exactly in the greatest part of town . ”
48584	48592	48593	48593	She	414	“ It ’s all we can afford . ”
48640	48662	48663	48663	She	414	“ I ’m still going to check . You never know what might be out there . Maybe we could sublet … ”
48691	48701	48685	48685	I	1454	“ Sit down . I ’ll be right back . ”
48804	48809	48852	48852	women	353	“ The Palm is Sacred ”
48911	48917	48896	48896	They	866	“ What in the world ? ”
48930	48943	48924	48924	she	414	“ It ’s the ancient book of the Fireside Women ’s Society . ”
48944	48955	48956	48956	She	414	“ Ohh - kay , and what in the world ? ”
48972	48977	48966	48966	I	1454	“ First , shots . ”
49011	49025	48999	48999	I	1454	“ We do n’t have lime , but this will do , right ? ”
49026	49033	49034	49034	She	414	“ What is this , Sly ? ”
49040	49058	49059	49059	She	414	“ I have n’t been able to confirm it , but I think these ladies were witches . ”
49068	49078	49059	49059	She	414	“ What ’s ‘ The palm is sacred ’ ? ”
49079	49097	49098	49098	I	1454	“ That was their motto . They were all about protecting Mother Earth and fighting for equality . ”
49110	49131	49098	49098	I	1454	“ Their primary focus was protecting Fireside and all its original families — of which I happen to be one . ”
49142	49147	49148	49148	She	414	“ Bottom ’s up ! ”
49162	49181	49182	49182	Court	414	“ Wait ! Not bottoms up ! I meant to say , here ’s mud in your eye . ”
49196	49203	49188	49188	she	414	“ What difference does that make ? ”
49204	49210	49211	49211	I	1454	“ I do n’t know . ”
49218	49249	49211	49211	I	1454	“ It ’s what I said last time we did this , and it worked . We have to repeat the process exactly like before . Now do the shot . ”
49292	49297	49298	49298	I	1454	“ Fierce like us , ”
49308	49314	49298	49298	I	1454	“ Now for the spell . ”
49315	49319	49298	49298	I	1454	“ Hold up … ”
49327	49366	49367	49367	She	414	“ Stop right there . I did n’t sign up for summoning demons or dead girls showing up in my bedroom or that kind of thing . I do n’t want that . Nope , nope , nope ! ”
49380	49387	49367	49367	She	414	“ It ’s not like that ! ”
49402	49435	49367	49367	She	414	“ Trust me . I did it with Daisy when Scout was gone . We brought him back ! I ’m telling you , it was crazy , and it totally works . ”
49436	49443	49444	49444	Her	414	“ Brought him back from where ? ”
49459	49467	49468	49468	I	1454	“ Well , not from the dead , ”
49471	49484	49468	49468	I	1454	“ Back to town . He legit was back the next day . ”
49485	49498	49449	49449	she	414	“ I do n’t like messing with the spirit world , Sly . ”
49499	49502	49449	49449	she	414	“ Look . ”
49515	49568	49449	49449	she	414	“ This is n’t about spirits . I mean , it is about spirits , but it ’s about good spirits wanting to help us . These women put this book together for situations just like this — to protect us through the ages . They do n’t want to hurt us . ”
49569	49574	49449	49449	she	414	“ Dead old ladies . ”
49575	49580	49581	49581	I	1454	“ Just be cool . ”
49590	49642	49643	49643	She	872	“ It says we need rosemary , sage , lavender , fresh basil , mint , and a handful of coarse salt . You grab the rosemary , sage , basil , and salt from the kitchen , I ’ll get the candles , lavender , and mint from my bag . ”
49689	49696	49697	49697	Court	414	“ I do n’t like this … ”
49733	49786	49728	49728	I	1454	“ Hold my hands , and I ’ll say the words . Gods above and gods below , protect this home from wicked foe . Ancestors ancient and old , defend this home from hearts of cold . Spirits from beyond the misty silver , protect this home from those who pilfer . ”
49819	49824	49825	49825	she	414	“ Is that it ? ”
49828	49835	49825	49825	she	414	“ I did n’t see anything . ”
49836	49843	49844	49844	I	1454	“ You do n’t need to . ”
49852	49872	49873	49873	I	1454	“ We protected this apartment from wicked foe and robbers … If anything , it ’ll help us sleep . ”
49892	49920	49921	49921	She	414	“ The tequila will help me sleep . I ’ll get Oliver , and we can bundle up in my bed tonight . It ’s big enough . ”
49944	49958	49931	49931	I	1454	“ Do n’t let me down Fireside ladies . The palm is sacred . ”
50089	50101	50078	50078	I	1454	“ Come on , ancestors . Do n’t let me down . ”
50156	50177	50178	50178	She	414	“ I can talk to the guys at Palmetto Rehab and see if they need an extra pair of hands . ”
50191	50207	50178	50178	She	414	“ You think they ’d hire me ? I ’ve never worked in a clinic . ”
50208	50231	50178	50178	She	414	“ I was straight out of school when they hired me . No promises , but I ’ve been there a while . ”
50232	50240	50241	50241	My	1454	“ That would be fantastic , Court . ”
50290	50304	50305	50305	She	888	“ Hey , you go on inside . I ’ll be right there . ”
50314	50317	50305	50305	She	888	“ Joselyn ! ”
50328	50368	50305	50305	She	888	“ I ’ll be right inside , and you know these guys . We were just here last week getting the order . Talk to the desk clerk , and I ’ll be with you before anything else happens . ”
50369	50375	50305	50305	She	888	“ You have the pictures . ”
50376	50379	50380	50380	I	1454	“ Right ! ”
50386	50400	50401	50401	She	888	“ Just let me set this up , and I ’ll be there . ”
50756	50764	50755	50755	Spencer	621	“ A left - handed Fender Stratocaster ! ”
50780	50794	50765	50766	Heather Olsen	634	“ A vendor in Kansas had it , complete with case and papers . ”
50795	50798	50799	50799	Daisy	446	“ Kansas ? ”
50829	50835	50836	50836	Heather	634	“ Can you believe it ? ”
50866	50888	50861	50861	Daisy	446	“ I was on a road trip with my husband , and I always make him stop at the flea markets . ”
50889	50896	50897	50897	Daisy	446	“ I brake for flea markets ? ”
50900	50914	50897	50897	Daisy	446	“ I love it when that happens . Look at it , Spencer . ”
50915	50923	50924	50924	I	1454	“ Yes , it ’s a guitar . ”
50957	50974	50987	50987	she	446	“ Dated 1962 … Slab fingerboard . That ’s the year they changed it , yes ? ”
50975	50980	50981	50981	Daisy	446	“ Do you play ? ”
50993	51014	50987	50987	she	446	“ No , but the slab fingerboard makes it a very rare piece — and it ’s in mint condition . ”
51015	51020	51021	51021	Heather	634	“ Are you ready ? ”
51030	51034	51035	51035	Daisy	446	“ How much ? ”
51040	51044	51045	51045	Daisy	446	“ Twenty grand ! ”
51052	51065	51045	51045	Daisy	446	“ I do n’t know what that means . Is it good ? ”
51066	51073	51074	51074	My	1454	“ It ’s better than good . ”
51078	51094	51074	51074	My	1454	“ Nice work , Olsen . You ’ll easily get sixty for it at auction . ”
51095	51099	51100	51100	She	446	“ I know ! ”
51157	51164	51147	51149	a young woman	911	“ This is a gorgeous piece . ”
51181	51184	51171	51171	I	1454	“ Date ? ”
51185	51188	51189	51189	Daisy	446	“ 1887 . ”
51195	51216	51189	51189	Daisy	446	“ Just look at the movement in the skirt . So detailed , all the way down to the ruffles . ”
51217	51225	51226	51226	I	1454	“ It ’s distinctive of the artist . ”
51234	51272	51226	51226	I	1454	“ I brought this one just for you , Spence . I knew you ’d love it . Found it at an estate sale — the woman ’s grandmother had bought it in Germany in the forties . ”
51273	51281	51282	51282	Daisy	446	“ How could someone part with this ? ”
51291	51295	51282	51282	Daisy	446	“ How much ? ”
51296	51299	51300	51300	She	446	“ Ten . ”
51322	51332	51333	51333	She	446	“ You ’ll easily get twenty thousand at auction . ”
51338	51342	51333	51333	She	446	“ I know ! ”
51352	51361	51349	51349	I	1454	“ Grafton is very lucky to have you . ”
51362	51379	51380	51380	Her	446	“ What ’s this ? A compliment from the great Spencer Carrollton ? Am I dreaming ? ”
51449	51461	51434	51434	Daisy	446	“ She ’s so beautiful . I want her for myself . ”
51503	51525	51526	51526	Our	918	“ She ’ll be in your shop until the auction . Maybe I can put a bug in someone ’s ear . ”
51580	51590	51591	51591	He	919	“ Why did n’t we hire Heather , again ? ”
51598	51605	51591	51591	He	919	“ You ca n’t hire her . ”
51615	51633	51634	51634	He	919	“ If she leaves Grafton , she ’s moving to Oceanside to help me run my store . ”
51663	51680	51634	51634	He	919	“ Is this a Marsh ? My God , Heather , where did you find it ? ”
51681	51688	51689	51689	Heather	634	“ That is indeed a Marsh . ”
51695	51725	51689	51689	Heather	634	“ Can you believe it ? They ’re so rare , and a jade — the rarest of them all . It ’s like a needle in a haystack . ”
51726	51731	51732	51732	Daisy	446	“ Let me see . ”
51738	51744	51732	51732	Daisy	446	“ Sly would love this . ”
51762	51784	51756	51756	I	1454	“ It ’s missing one little baguette , but I have a fellow in New Hampshire I trust to repair it . ”
51785	51789	51790	51790	Daisy	446	“ Ten thousand ? ”
51802	51817	51818	51818	He	920	“ Your jewelry skills have improved . I think that ’s right , yes ? ”
51826	51841	51818	51818	He	920	“ I ’m hoping to get at least fifteen if not twenty for it . ”
51842	51848	51849	51850	My partner	326	“ I bet you will . ”
51900	51905	51894	51894	I	1454	“ This Marsh piece . ”
51919	51930	51931	51931	Her	326	“ What if I offered you twelve for it now ? ”
51941	51956	51936	51936	she	326	“ I had a feeling you might be interested when Daisy mentioned her cousin . ”
51968	51975	51936	51936	she	326	“ It ’s nothing like that . ”
51976	51990	51991	51991	She	326	“ Now , now . Do n’t go all Mr. Freeze on me . ”
51999	52019	51991	51991	She	326	“ I ’ll sell it to you for ten , even though I could easily get fifteen for it . ”
52020	52029	51936	51936	she	326	“ I ’m not asking for any favors . ”
52030	52046	52047	52047	I	1454	“ Consider it a sacrifice to the gods for unfreezing your cold , cold heart . ”
52055	52060	52047	52047	I	1454	“ Listen , Olsen — ”
52061	52069	52070	52070	She	326	“ No , you listen , Carrollton . ”
52084	52135	52076	52076	I	1454	“ You ’ve been this closed - off asshole for as long as I ’ve known you . I do n’t get it . You ’re a good - looking man , and if Sly has somehow gotten through to you , I ’m happy to keep the ball rolling . ”
52136	52139	52140	52140	I	1454	“ Females , ”
52143	52180	52181	52181	She	326	“ You and Daisy deserve one another . I hope you do retire from Grafton and go to work with her . From what I understand that town needs a fresh influx of interfering old biddies . ”
52200	52230	52185	52185	I	1454	“ I ’ll take your ten grand , and I ’ll send it to my guy for repairs . It ’ll take a few weeks , is that okay ? ”
52231	52238	52322	52322	Joselyn	177	“ I ’m changing my mind . ”
52239	52246	52247	52247	She	326	“ No , you ’re not ! ”
52255	52298	52247	52247	She	326	“ You ’re not going to kill my belief in happily ever after . I ’m getting this baby fixed , and I ’ll tie it up in a pink bow . I expect you to name your first child after me . ”
52307	52319	52299	52299	I	1454	“ Are you hungry ? Let ’s get something to eat . ”
52389	52398	52399	52399	Courtney	414	“ It ’s because you were with me . ”
52407	52422	52423	52423	She	414	“ I think it ’s because the deputy has a thing for his dispatcher . ”
52431	52474	52423	52423	She	414	“ Whatever it takes . I ’ll follow up with my department chair about you joining Palmetto . He said if there ’s money in the budget , he ’ll find a place for you . Do n’t want him to forget . ”
52475	52483	52484	52484	I	1454	“ You are too good to me . ”
52497	52518	52492	52492	she	414	“ If we ’re going to move to a better apartment , I need to get you earning some money . ”
52519	52564	52492	52492	she	414	“ Speaking of , I ’ve got that client tonight at five - thirty . Want me to grab a pizza on the way home ? We can chill out and watch Unsolved Mysteries or something about frogs if that ’s too much … ? ”
52565	52571	52572	52572	She	414	“ It ’s a date . ”
52584	52598	52572	52572	She	414	“ Come on , Ollie ! You ’re going to make me late ! ”
52599	52603	52604	52604	I	1454	“ Go on . ”
52609	52622	52604	52604	I	1454	“ I ’ll drive him to school . You get to work . ”
52623	52626	52627	52627	Her	414	“ Sure ? ”
52637	52658	52632	52632	I	1454	“ Of course ! I ’ll get him to school . You get to work and talk to your boss . ”
52659	52667	52668	52668	She	414	“ He ’s not really my boss … ”
52788	52797	52779	52779	Ollie	374	“ You ’re wearing a lot of makeup . ”
52798	52803	52804	52804	I	1454	“ Too much blush ? ”
52824	52839	52840	52840	He	1454	“ Your eyes are too dark , and why are your lips so shiny ? ”
52857	52868	52840	52840	He	1454	“ You can be kind of rude , you know ? ”
52895	52901	52887	52887	I	1454	“ Is something bothering you ? ”
52927	52930	52931	52931	I	1454	“ Hey . ”
52940	52952	52953	52953	He	1454	“ Talk to me . We ’re roomies , after all . ”
52996	53033	52982	52982	I	1454	“ You can trust me , you know ? I ’m your aunt Sly . I might not look like the goddess of all wisdom , but I know a lot more than you ’d expect — ”
53034	53057	53058	53058	My	1454	“ Mom said all men are assholes . But … I ’m a man . Does that make me an asshole too ? ”
53068	53073	53063	53063	I	1454	“ Ollie … No … ”
53131	53200	53119	53119	I	1454	“ Sometimes people say things when they ’re upset , and they ’re really just exaggerating . Like that time you said you hated Chuck E. Cheese because it was closed when we wanted to go ? It ’s like that . You do n’t hate Chuck E. Cheese , and your mom does n’t think all men are assholes . She ’d never think that of you . ”
53201	53224	53119	53119	I	1454	“ It ’s because my dad ’s a bad man . He hurts my mom , and he wants to hurt me . ”
53276	53311	53270	53270	Lord	941	“ Your dad is having some problems . We hope one day he can get some help for those problems , but for now , it ’s better if you ’re not around him . ”
53312	53334	53335	53335	His	940	“ He ’s still my dad . Jesse said he ’s going to grow up and be just like his dad . ”
53364	53393	53359	53359	I	1454	“ Look at me , Oliver . You can choose what kind of man you ’ll be . Understand ? Some people do n’t even have a dad … ”
53404	53430	53431	53431	He	940	“ You could be like your mom . She ’s smart and strong and loving . What if you grow up to be like her ? ”
53468	53476	53465	53465	he	940	“ I ’ll be a better man . ”
53477	53484	53485	53485	Courtney	414	“ He just canceled on you ? ”
53504	53520	53495	53495	I	1454	“ He said some work thing came up , and he ’d have to reschedule . ”
53561	53592	53593	53593	Oliver	374	“ Sorry I did n’t get the pizza . We could still watch Unsolved Mysteries if you want ? Or a nature show … I ’ll make mac and cheese ! ”
53611	53618	53604	53604	Courtney	414	“ Nope — we’re getting sushi ! ”
53619	53622	53623	53623	Ollie	374	“ Sushi ! ”
53636	53643	53623	53623	Ollie	374	“ Sushi ! Sushi ! Sushi ! ”
53644	53649	53650	53650	My	1454	“ Are you sure ? ”
53654	53667	53650	53650	My	1454	“ I ’m going to be short now that Mystery Client canceled . ”
53668	53681	53623	53623	Ollie	374	“ I have a coupon for Sakitumi — dinner ’s on me ! ”
53682	53694	53695	53695	We	944	“ Grab the keys . I ’ll order while you drive . ”
53709	53717	53718	53718	I	1454	“ Best sushi in the Soda City , ”
53755	53783	53747	53747	I	1454	“ Do you think I should get credit cards up front and threaten to charge a cancellation fee if they do n’t give 24 hours ’ notice ? ”
53784	53804	53805	53805	My	1454	“ Nope . I think you should come and work with me at Palmetto and not worry about it ! ”
53810	53816	53805	53805	My	1454	“ I got the job ? ”
53817	53859	53747	53747	I	1454	“ You got an interview , but of course they ’re going to hire you . He ’ll take one look at your résumé and give you the job . It does n’t hurt that you ’re super friendly and likable . ”
53860	53865	53866	53866	I	1454	“ Tell me more … ”
53887	53897	53898	53898	she	414	“ This old thing does n’t even have Bluetooth , ”
53901	53922	53898	53898	she	414	“ Do n’t hate on Betsy . She gets me where I need to go with my massage chair intact . ”
53923	53928	53929	53929	Oliver	374	“ Good ole Betsy ! ”
53935	53942	53929	53929	Oliver	374	“ This is Betsy , Chartreuse ! ”
53943	53953	53954	53954	I	1454	“ Ollie ! You did not bring that frog ! ”
53957	53961	53954	53954	I	1454	“ Do not — ”
53962	53975	53976	53976	He	374	“ I know , do not let her go in my van . ”
54013	54021	54022	54022	Ollie	374	“ That Do n’t Impress Me Much . ”
54080	54089	54090	54090	Courtney	414	“ Okay , so you ’re a billionaire … ”
54111	54129	54105	54105	I	1454	“ You know , Ollie , you ’re a pretty cool kid to like sushi so much . ”
54142	54146	54147	54147	he	1454	“ California roll ! ”
54150	54159	54147	54147	he	1454	“ And edamame … and miso … and … ”
54172	54177	54147	54147	he	1454	“ Mother of pearl ! ”
54178	54183	54184	54184	Ollie	374	“ What ’s that ? ”
54189	54195	54196	54196	Courtney	414	“ Mother of pearl roll … ”
54204	54209	54196	54196	Courtney	414	“ What is it ? ”
54270	54274	54255	54255	She	955	“ That flipping … ”
54498	54508	54490	54490	she	414	“ Are you okay ? What ’s going on ? ”
54625	54630	54607	54607	I	1454	“ What ’s happening ? ”
54682	54694	54673	54673	I	1454	“ I ’m sorry , but I ’ve got to go . ”
54743	54755	54734	54734	She	260	“ Excuse me , sir ! You ca n’t do that . ”
54824	54850	54818	54818	I	1454	“ I need to see the receipt for that last order — the blue minivan ? I believe it ’s that one in your hand . ”
54851	54870	54808	54816	the pimple - faced curbside waiter by the shoulder	260	“ I ’m sorry , sir , I ca n’t do that . Privacy laws , and all — ”
54871	54875	54876	54876	My	1454	“ How much ? ”
54900	54909	54891	54891	His	1454	“ The name is either Joselyn or Courtney … ”
54922	54930	54910	54911	The kid	1876	“ Why do you want to know ? ”
54955	54975	54976	54977	The guy	1876	“ I found her credit card , and I do n’t know how to get in touch with her . ”
54991	54999	54976	54977	The guy	1876	“ Which one ? Courtney or Joselyn ? ”
55000	55008	55009	55009	I	1454	“ Oh , for Christ ’s sake . ”
55023	55026	55027	55027	He	1876	“ Hey ! ”
55053	55059	55046	55046	I	1454	“ Sorry for your trouble . ”
55255	55266	55242	55242	I	1454	“ It ’s me , Joselyn . Open the door . ”
55295	55309	55310	55310	She	414	“ What are you doing here ? How did you get this address ? ”
55324	55329	55317	55317	she	414	“ Get out here . ”
55356	55368	55369	55369	She	414	“ Oh ! Stop this … . What are you doing ? ”
55397	55404	55405	55405	My	1454	“ Why are you following me ? ”
55481	55504	55505	55505	She	414	“ I ’m not following you . I went with Courtney and Oliver to get sushi . You ’re interrupting our dinner . ”
55522	55529	55517	55517	I	1454	“ I ’m interrupting your dinner . ”
55589	55612	55578	55578	her	414	“ Why all the texts , then ? You said to keep my hands to myself . You said we were done . ”
55626	55639	55640	55640	She	414	“ So you went right out and found a new random hookup . ”
55742	55751	55752	55752	She	414	“ Will you let me kiss you now ? ”
55781	55784	55775	55775	she	414	“ No . ”
55824	55881	55819	55819	God	93	“ That was no random . I was having dinner with Heather . You remember Heather Olsen ? You met her and her husband Jim at the gala . Grafton is giving us an exclusive on the prize selections from their summer auction . She ’ll be taking them to Daisy ’s store in the morning . ”
55896	55901	55902	55902	Joselyn	177	“ We were hungry . ”
55963	55969	55955	55955	She	988	“ I guess I overreacted . ”
55976	55981	55955	55955	She	988	“ I ’m sorry . ”
56018	56035	55955	55955	She	988	“ You hoped the worst day of my past was the best day of my future . ”
56044	56050	55955	55955	She	988	“ I read that somewhere . ”
56051	56056	56057	56059	A police siren	989	“ It ’s good . ”
56071	56084	56065	56065	I	1454	“ This is a terrible neighborhood . What are you doing here ? ”
56085	56101	55955	55955	She	988	“ Trying to make ends meet . Something I ’m sure you know nothing about . ”
56102	56118	56119	56119	I	1454	“ I ’ve told you . You do n’t know about my past , Sin . ”
56132	56150	56151	56151	I	1454	“ You have my number . Call me if anything goes wrong . Or you feel scared . ”
56177	56181	56182	56182	She	988	“ Thank you . ”
56192	56217	56218	56218	She	988	“ I helped Court get a restraining order . Now we have a patrol car that drives by every night between ten and eleven . ”
56239	56247	56230	56230	her	988	“ I ’m available 24 - 7 . ”
56248	56254	56255	56255	My	1454	“ I ’ll remember that . ”
56292	56303	56289	56289	I	1454	“ I ’ll need to see you Monday at eleven . ”
56314	56324	56311	56311	I	1454	“ Irritated my back chasing after you just now . ”
56325	56337	56289	56289	I	1454	“ I ’ll make an appointment and send you a confirmation . ”
56338	56343	56344	56344	I	1454	“ Goodnight , Joselyn . ”
56507	56517	56518	56518	I	1454	“ So , you see , I am desperate , ”
56778	56782	56763	56763	I	1454	“ Mr. Santiago ? ”
56901	56912	56926	56926	I	1454	“ Miss Winthrop , I ’ve been waiting for you . ”
56961	56975	56953	56953	I	1454	“ Looks like you know as much about my job as I do . ”
56976	56985	56986	56986	He	1010	“ I ’ve spent time with massage therapists . ”
57000	57008	56986	56986	He	1010	“ I ’ll just get started then . ”
57024	57032	57014	57014	I	1454	“ Would you prefer peppermint or lavender ? ”
57033	57042	56953	56953	I	1454	“ Neither , if you do n’t mind . ”
57057	57071	57048	57048	I	1454	“ You said the pain is coming from a lower back strain ? ’ “
57074	57094	57048	57048	I	1454	” Rubbing my hands together , I start with light strokes on his shoulders slowly making my way down . “
57107	57130	57048	57048	I	1454	” I ’m quiet , working steadily , focusing on my hands . I assume he ’s fallen asleep when he speaks . “
57136	57150	57048	57048	I	1454	” It ’s an odd question , but I do n’t mind answering . “
57170	57171	57157	57157	I	1454	” “
57179	57180	57157	57157	I	1454	” “
57216	57217	57203	57203	I	1454	” “
57237	57257	57258	57258	I	1454	” I ’ve answered this question before , and I start to relax as I talk about my goals . “
57295	57296	57300	57300	friends	1721	” “
57304	57351	57352	57353	Miss Winthrop	108	” His question is forceful and a little confusing , jumping back to why I came here . I return to my original assumption he ’s foreign — perhaps he ’s looking for a way to make friends ? But he works in this busy office . “
57355	57386	57352	57353	Miss Winthrop	108	” Clearing my throat , I move my hands into what he said was the injured part of his back , deepening the pressure . He does n’t even flinch . “
57393	57394	57352	57353	Miss Winthrop	108	” “
57399	57418	57352	57353	Miss Winthrop	108	” My shoulders tense , and I step back , picking up my towel and wiping my arms . “
57427	57428	57429	57429	You	1017	” “
57436	57473	57429	57429	You	1017	” It ’s a smooth observation , a smile in his voice , almost like he ’s leading me with his words . Picking up my bag , I take another step away from the table . “
57482	57483	57484	57484	I	1454	” “
57521	57598	57515	57515	she	1019	” My heart leaps to my throat , and I bolt for the door , throwing my bag over my shoulder as I run . Ozzy is off the table like a jaguar , nearly catching me . The whisper of his hand just missing my arm causes me to shriek , and I grab the doorknob , jerking it open . It ’s just enough delay for him to grab the back of my scrubs . “
57601	57797	57515	57515	she	1019	” I scream , falling on my stomach in the hallway . Clawing the floor , I manage to get my feet under me and pull myself up before he can land on top of me . Running as hard as I can to the door , I fling everything I pass in the way behind me — a chair , a potted tree , the computer screen off the receptionist ’s desk . It lands with a massive crash . If I ’m lucky , there ’s a security camera . Otherwise , whoever owns this office is going to be confused when they come into work tomorrow . Slamming the doors of the suite , I see his shadow rising up in the frosted glass , and I drag a long , metal planter in front of it . He hits it with a slam , and I run hard to the elevator , pressing the button repeatedly , looking back over my shoulder , crying out as I pant for breath . He ’s almost through the door , and I give up , scanning all over the place for the stairs . “
57802	57975	57976	57976	Joselyn	177	” My eyes land on the sign for the restrooms . Deciding I do n’t have time to wait , I run full - speed into what turns out to be an enormous stone facility . A powder area with sinks and a full - length mirror divides the front from the 12 stalls in the back . It ’s empty and dark , and I run to the middle stall , pushing open a door and quickly sliding the lock before crawling , military - style on my belly under the dividers to the very last one . I lock that door as well and step carefully onto the toilet seat . I do n’t know if he saw me come in , and I clutch my hand over my mouth to muffle my breathing , straining my ears for any sound of footsteps . Tears stream down my cheeks . I ’m winded , and every snort , every heavy exhale feels magnified a thousand times in this stone enclosure . “
57978	57999	58000	58000	I	1454	” Ozzy sing - songs my name like it ’s a horror film , and more tears coat my face . “
58016	58049	58010	58010	I	1454	” He slaps the doors open , one by one , and I squeeze my eyes shut , praying to God and the saints , and the Fireside ladies to help me . “
58062	58077	58010	58010	I	1454	” Slam ! He pushes another door open , slowly moving down the row . “
58099	58105	58084	58084	He	177	” Slam ! Another door … “
58123	58133	58117	58117	he	177	” Slam ! He ’s one door away from … “
58168	58185	58160	58160	Joselyn	177	” Clink … He ’s at the door I locked , and my eyes squeeze shut . “
58199	58408	58160	58160	Joselyn	177	” At the first Boom ! of his boot striking particleboard , I step down from the toilet , sliding the lock slowly open . Another Boom ! and my lips squeeze shut against a scream . As soon as he breaks through that wrong door , I plan to run as hard as I can for the exit . It ’s my only hope of escaping . It ’s got to work . My fingers grip the handle for his last kick when Woosh ! The toilet behind me automatically flushes . I jerk the door open and our eyes meet . His glitter with satisfaction , but I swing my bag of massage oils , warming saucer , and rocks with all my might , aiming for his head as I run directly at him . He ’s taken aback that I ’m running at him , and the bag strikes his temple , throwing him to the ground . On the way down , he grabs my leg , and I go down , too , striking my cheek against the stall divider . Light explodes behind my eyes , and I roll onto my back with a moan . Ozzy pushes off the floor . “
58416	58701	58160	58160	Joselyn	177	” The sound of his voice spikes adrenaline in my veins , and I shake off my disorientation . I ’m on my feet again , snatching up my bag and running at top speed for the exit . Sticky blood is on my cheek , but I do n’t stop running . I ’m in the marble foyer , and I see the sign for the stairs . Bursting through the doors , I run around and around , gasping for air , exhaling little cries of fear , flying as fast as I can down all twenty - two floors to the bottom . I slam the metal crash doors open and do n’t even pause for the security guard . I ’m in the parking lot , in Betsy , screeching away towards the apartment . We ca n’t stay there tonight . Chapter 22 Spencer Rocking back in my chair , I tap my finger against my desktop waiting for Joselyn to appear . It ’s Monday morning , and after our encounter Friday night , I did n’t expect her to be late . She ’s very law - abiding these days . On Friday , it took all my willpower to hold back from kissing her . Her reaction to seeing me having dinner with Heather was quite satisfying . What am I going to do with this woman — and Heather with the nonstop jokes . Heather actually texted me , Some people are worth melting for , which apparently is from a children ’s movie . I did n’t reply . At last , my door opens , and Joselyn breezes in , rolling her chair . “
58726	58758	58716	58716	me	1454	” She ’s wearing dark sunglasses and too much makeup , but she ca n’t hide the large purple bruise and cut held together with a butterfly bandage across her cheek . “
58763	58775	58716	58716	me	1454	” I ’m out of my chair , crossing the room . “
58782	58783	58716	58716	me	1454	” “
58792	58823	58788	58788	I	1454	” She waves her hand , but I lightly place my fingers on her chin , tilting her head to the side and doing my best not to hurt her . “
58829	58830	58831	58831	I	1454	” “
58836	58912	58831	58831	I	1454	” She turns away quickly , pressing her lips together . I notice a tremor in her voice , and my stomach knots all the way up to my throat . She ’s hiding something , and I have a sneaking suspicion I know what it is . All I can think of is hoodie guy disappearing around the corner outside her apartment complex on Friday . I should never have left her there alone . “
58918	58927	58928	58928	Spencer	621	” My voice is low , icy calm . “
58930	58949	58928	58928	Spencer	621	” It ’s a breathy retort , and she waves as if she ’ll brush aside my concern . “
58966	58979	58981	58981	he	1025	” Catching her by the arms , I make her face me . “
58988	58989	58985	58986	The husband	1026	” “
59037	59050	59065	59065	he	893	” With every word , the fury in my chest grows tighter . “
59055	59056	59057	59057	Member	178	” “
59061	59062	59059	59059	Mark	179	” “
59068	59069	59070	59070	I	1454	” “
59075	59082	59070	59070	I	1454	” She ’s quiet , subdued . “
59147	59148	59136	59136	I	1454	” “
59160	59180	59181	59181	You	1034	” She nods , and I can tell she ’s afraid . Her fear has murder on my mind . “
59204	59209	59213	59213	you	1034	” She laughs bitterly . “
59219	59220	59213	59213	you	1034	” “
59248	59260	59226	59226	You	1034	” Her jaw drops , but I hold up a finger . “
59276	59277	59270	59270	I	1454	” “
59301	59349	59290	59290	she	414	” My fist tightens , and darkness clouds my vision . I ’d love for that bastard to try something at my home . I ’d love to show him what a real man will do . Clearing my throat , I give a more civilized answer . “
59424	59425	59426	59426	I	1454	” “
59494	59524	59489	59489	I	1454	” Her protests fall on deaf ears . I turn to my desk , punching up Allied Universal on my iPad and arranging for a guard to start today . “
59535	59536	59533	59533	Mark	179	” “
59539	59540	59533	59533	Mark	179	” “
59554	59555	59541	59541	They	1052	” “
59573	59602	59562	59562	I	1454	” Her face lowers , and when she blinks , a crystal tear hits her cheek . It ’s like a fist smashing in and grabbing my heart . “
59606	59620	59621	59621	You	1054	” I pull her to my chest , and she melts into me . “
59655	59656	59648	59648	you	1054	” “
59672	59694	59665	59665	I	1454	” Sliding my hand up and down her back , I vaguely note the prick her words cause in my chest . “
59725	59737	59738	59738	I	1454	” And I ’ll be damned if he hurts Joselyn again . “
59790	59844	59780	59780	We	1059	” This stubborn , beautiful woman . At least she ’s letting me comfort her . I ’d like to kiss her , take her home , and lock the door , throw away the key . Enough . I step away , going to the desk and picking up my office phone . “
59861	59939	59852	59852	I	1454	” She watches me , looking from my face to the phone , but slowly she takes it and gingerly types the numbers into the keypad . I take a seat in my desk chair , picking up a stress ball and squeezing it in my fist . It ’s been a long time since I ’ve been in a fight , but I can see myself smashing that guy ’s head against the concrete . Repeatedly . “
59942	59954	59852	59852	I	1454	” Her eyes blink away , and she turns her back . “
59986	59992	59993	59993	I	1454	” She exhales a laugh . “
60002	60044	60045	60045	He	621	” Leaning forward , I ’m out of my chair , walking around to stand in front of her again . When she looks up at me , I offer to take the phone , but she shakes her head no . “
60069	60090	60063	60063	I	1454	” Her eyes close , and I feel like she ’s not selling it until they open again , wider . “
60106	60119	60120	60120	She	1067	” Lowering the receiver from her ear , she holds it out . “
60128	60140	60120	60120	She	1067	” Taking the phone , I give her a knowing grin . “
60145	60146	60120	60120	She	1067	” “
60151	60158	60120	60120	She	1067	” Courtney ’s voice is tense . “
60176	60223	60120	60120	She	1067	” I recognize the fear in her tone , the hopelessness . It touches a part of me I locked away a long time ago , and now , seeing this happening up close , I ’m taken aback by the rage it unearths in me . “
60227	60242	60120	60120	She	1067	” I force the anger out of my voice in favor of calm reassurance . “
60290	60291	60292	60292	Ollie	374	” “
60309	60310	60292	60292	Ollie	374	” “
60332	60333	60323	60323	I	1454	” “
60340	60360	60361	60361	I	1454	” My jaw tightens . The whole truth of why is privileged information , but I can easily say , “
60395	60401	60384	60384	I	1454	” Her reply is calm . “
60424	60425	60426	60426	You	1077	” “
60441	60442	60431	60431	I	1454	” “
60448	60503	60443	60443	I	1454	” Her words move something in my chest . Maybe the fucking ice is melting , but it ’s not for the reason Heather and Daisy like to tease me about . Or perhaps it is that … fueled by the past . Replacing the receiver , I place my hand on Joselyn ’s . “
60559	60659	60549	60549	I	1454	” Her lips tighten , and I see her struggling with an argument . I ’m not going to hear it , so she might as well save her breath . She lets it go , and my reaction is bittersweet . That fucker must have really scared her , which has me seeing red . No one threatens my girl . The security guard at the Member ’s Mark high rise is an overweight incompetent with crumbs on his shirt . Joselyn ’s hand is in the crook of my arm , and I cut her a look . “
60674	60683	60549	60549	I	1454	” She cuts me a look right back . “
60710	60711	60712	60712	He	1085	” “
60721	60742	60712	60712	He	1085	” I step forward , placing my palm on the dark console in front of him , reading his nametag . “
60750	60751	60752	60752	Hi	197	” “
60754	60763	60752	60752	Hi	197	” He stands up fast , smiling broadly . “
60785	60786	60778	60778	you	196	” “
60799	60820	60778	60778	you	196	” I exhale under my breath . Joselyn pinches the inside of my upper arm , and I flinch away . “
60823	60830	60831	60831	You	196	” It ’s a level command . “
60850	60865	60847	60847	he	177	” Doug ’s light brow furrows , his fleshy face tilts to the side . “
60894	60915	60891	60891	you	177	” He ’s overzealous , childish , and I ’m ready to call the proprietor when Joselyn cuts me off . “
60936	60937	60938	60938	He	177	” “
60942	60950	60938	60938	He	177	” Doug looks down at the desk . “
60989	60990	60982	60982	you	177	” “
60993	61011	61012	61012	She	1091	” Joselyn ’s tone is placating , like she ’s about to let Snuffy off the hook . “
61015	61024	61025	61025	She	1091	” I interject with a bit more force . “
61042	61053	61036	61036	he	198	” Stay - Puff looks at his computer screen again . “
61063	61073	61074	61074	He	198	” He looks up at us with wide eyes . “
61084	61101	61079	61079	He	198	” I ’m about to rip into him , but Joselyn tugs my arm sharply again . “
61125	61126	61118	61118	I	1454	” “
61129	61136	61140	61140	Miss	1096	” His blue eyes go wide . “
61142	61143	61144	61144	Winthrop	108	” “
61157	61158	61159	61159	Doug	196	” “
61161	61165	61159	61159	Doug	196	” Joselyn interrupts . “
61226	61236	61237	61237	I	1454	” Doug ’s eyes grow rounder with every word . “
61266	61280	61257	61257	They	1098	” I ’m ready to say more , but Joselyn grabs my coat . “
61291	61309	61286	61286	I	1454	” She drags me out the door , but I ’m not ready to let this go . “
61320	61321	61322	61322	He	196	” “
61326	61335	61322	61322	He	196	” She ’s walking fast to my car . “
61367	61368	61361	61361	I	1454	” “
61377	61378	61371	61371	You	1096	” “
61407	61422	61404	61404	his	196	” Grabbing her by the shoulders , I turn her back to the car . “
61430	61441	61442	61442	I	1454	” She blinks rapidly , looking away over my shoulder . “
61479	61484	61485	61485	I	1454	” My jaw grinds . “
61488	61489	61485	61485	I	1454	” “
61512	61617	61618	61618	You	1105	” Reaching out , I grip the back of her neck , pulling her to my chest in a hug . I want to pull her mouth to mine . I want to pull her body to mine and hold her tight . She trembles slightly , and her hand fists in the back of my coat . I hold her until her breathing calms , until she seems to have recovered control . My hand relaxes and I massage her neck . I turn my face and inhale her hair . The idea of her being hurt or worse is unacceptable to me . “
61621	61640	61618	61618	You	1105	” My voice is rough , and she nods . Stepping back , I meet her misty eyes . “
61659	61663	61618	61618	You	1105	” Chapter 23 Joselyn “
61669	61679	61618	61618	You	1105	” Court sounds better than she has in weeks . “
61725	61748	61749	61749	He	295	” I ’m sitting on the foot of her bed as she doctors my eye with Neosporin and a fresh butterfly bandage . “
61788	61789	61782	61782	We	1112	” “
61803	61819	61793	61793	he	295	” Pulling my bottom lip between my teeth , I blink away from her eyes . “
61868	61869	61870	61871	This guy	295	” “
61884	61906	61879	61879	I	1454	” She grins down at me with her huge brown eyes . Her name should be Bambi with those gorgeous peepers . “
61921	61922	61879	61879	I	1454	” “
61971	61983	61967	61967	I	1454	” She presses her lips together and makes a whatever face . “
62027	62034	62015	62015	Mr.	295	” Standing , I exhale heavily . “
62070	62071	62072	62072	I	1454	” “
62087	62114	62081	62081	His	295	” Waving her away , I look down at the incoming text on my phone . It changes everything , and I jump to my feet . “
62141	62147	62150	62150	he	295	” She squeezes my waist . “
62167	62200	62201	62201	Mom	102	” The tension of the last two days drains from my body in a rush , and I want to sit down and cry with gratitude . Oliver peeks into the room . “
62203	62204	62201	62201	Mom	102	” “
62211	62217	62201	62201	Mom	102	” She waves him over . “
62237	62309	62232	62232	We	1116	” His little mouth curls into something like a smile as he climbs onto her bed , but I can tell he ’s anxious . I think about our conversation in the car , and I ’m worried about how he ’s processing all of this , from my black eye to our sudden move to his abruptly leaving school . Sitting on the bed , I reach for his hand . “
62338	62339	62340	62340	They	1119	” “
62346	62361	62340	62340	They	1119	” He looks down , tracing a fingernail along the leg of his jeans . “
62369	62370	62362	62362	Koalas	205	” “
62381	62391	62372	62372	I	1454	” I wrinkle my nose and muss his hair . “
62407	62408	62403	62405	those child geniuses	1121	” “
62411	62419	62420	62420	I	1454	” He gives me a tight smile . “
62431	62432	62433	62433	I	1454	” “
62439	62453	62433	62433	I	1454	” Courtney sits on the bed , putting her arm around his shoulders . “
62489	62502	62505	62505	Mom	102	” She gives him a hopeful smile , and his chin drops . “
62507	62592	62505	62505	Mom	102	” He does n’t even question her , and it breaks my heart a little . He ’ll do anything to make things easier for her , and I ’m not sure he ’s ever told her the things he said to me in the car . I make a mental note to watch how we talk in front of him , and I ’ve got to make time to tell her what he said in private . She stands , waving us away . “
62618	62619	62611	62611	I	1454	” “
62626	62630	62611	62611	I	1454	” I warn . “
62643	62644	62645	62645	I	1454	” “
62651	62676	62648	62648	I	1454	” She ’s doing her best to make Ollie feel at home . He lunges forward , giving her one more , big hug . “
62683	62710	62681	62681	Mom	102	” he whispers . She kisses his cheek , and when I see the tears in her eyes , I hop forward to grab his hand . “
62753	62754	62744	62744	I	1454	” “
62758	62774	62775	62775	Baby	73	” he exhales heavily , taking my hand and dragging me out of the room . “
62777	62778	62779	62779	I	1454	” “
62785	62953	62779	62779	I	1454	” I pretend to be offended , and when I glance back , Courtney mouths a thank you to me . I give her a wink and follow Ollie down the hall to our shared room . We figured we might as well continue being roomies in this new place . Also , the second bedroom has two twin beds . Spencer said the interior designer thought a children ’s wing would increase the resale value . Since I ’ve seen his Master wing , I can believe he has little interest in what happens on these lower floors — other than the kitchen . He was so insistent about us moving in here , yet at the same time , he ’s been very respectful about giving us our space . I wo n’t let my romantic imagination run wild over this . It ’s over - protective , but he has n’t said anything to indicate his feelings about being in a relationship have changed . “
62962	62981	62779	62779	I	1454	” His voice at my back makes me jump , and I turn fast with a little yip . “
62992	62993	62779	62779	I	1454	” “
62999	63006	62996	62996	I	1454	” I exhale a little laugh . “
63014	63047	63048	63048	Oliver	374	” My confession makes the muscle in his jaw move attractively . Over - protectiveness is a good look on him . He blinks it away , extending his hand to Ollie . “
63067	63068	63058	63058	I	1454	” “
63075	63086	63058	63058	I	1454	” Ollie nods , looking around like a little man . “
63089	63093	63094	63094	I	1454	” Spencer straightens . “
63123	63199	63115	63115	Tom	207	” Tom steps up , and he ’s a tank of a man . I ’m guessing he ’s six - six , with broad shoulders , a broad chest , and thick legs . The only thing soft about him is a swoosh of blond hair over his left eye . He does n’t speak , he only nods . He ’s like a cartoon superhero . Spencer seems oblivious to Tom ’s appearance . “
63227	63235	63236	63236	Tom	207	” Spencer pats him on the shoulder . “
63254	63300	63304	63304	Tom	207	” Ollie and I are still holding hands , and I ’m pretty sure both our jaws are on the floor . Tom only gives us a curt nod . We nod back in unison , and Spencer dismisses the boulder assigned to watch us . “
63306	63322	63304	63304	Tom	207	” When he turns to me , everything shifts — even his tone is gentle . “
63329	63330	63324	63324	I	1454	” “
63335	63349	63324	63324	I	1454	” I do n’t know why I feel shy all of a sudden . “
63366	63413	63354	63354	I	1454	” We finally got an order from Rioz , and I completely understand now why he was so pissed I ruined two of his dinners from there — although , I think he forgave me for the first one . Ollie gives my hand a pull . “
63423	63432	63414	63414	We	1131	” A small grin lifts Spencer ’s lips . “
63450	63451	63452	63452	I	1454	” “
63455	63474	63475	63475	You	1130	” Ollie shrugs , charging ahead of us towards the bedroom we share . Spencer catches my arm . “
63485	63506	63481	63481	You	1130	” He has always been so observant of everything I do . Forcing a smile , I shake my head . “
63526	63542	63518	63518	Ollie	374	” His brow furrows , and he looks in the direction the little boy went . “
63559	63560	63561	63561	I	1454	” “
63575	63606	63571	63571	he	374	” Spencer seems genuinely concerned , and my heart melts a little more . Damn him . How can he be so wonderful and so infuriating at the same time ? “
63659	63667	63668	63668	You	1130	” Shaking my head , I smile . “
63686	63687	63673	63673	I	1454	” “
63699	63709	63693	63693	We	1133	” We start after Ollie , and I pause . “
63750	63751	63740	63740	They	1133	” “
63776	63803	63767	63767	I	1454	” Pressing my lips together , I wonder what will happen if I say he has to find a new massage therapist . I do n’t . “
63816	63844	63767	63767	I	1454	” His expression shifts ever so slightly . He ’s not the only one in this duet … dual ? Tracking the other ’s every facial quirk . “
63858	63859	63767	63767	I	1454	” “
63865	63866	63867	63867	I	1454	” “
63870	63896	63867	63867	I	1454	” The temperature ’s rising in the hall , but like a good little cock - blocker , Ollie tosses cold water all over it . “
63904	63908	63867	63867	I	1454	” Chapter 24 Spencer “
63918	63939	63867	63867	I	1454	” Oliver shouts , bouncing on his toes as he looks over the wooden fence surrounding the ancient tortoise exhibit . “
63944	63955	63867	63867	I	1454	” I tease . Joselyn leans into me and whispers . “
63976	63977	63973	63973	his	1140	” “
63988	64187	63978	63978	I	1454	” Before we left the house for the Riverbanks Zoo and Aquarium , I had Julien my personal chef , create an entirely new , little - boy - friendly menu for the duration . Apparently , when it comes to breakfast , it includes build - your - own pancakes , whipped cream , and chocolate milk . I ’d be concerned for the health of my little guest , but after last night , I think we ’re all focused on making him feel like this is a fun holiday and not a refugee situation . Joselyn told me what he has said to her about his parent ’s situation . In my experience , children always know more than we think they do , and even more than they share . His mother left for her job , smiling and behaving as if everything were fine , and watching him do his best to help her feel like he believed it , struck a chord inside me . It ’s a desire I remember well , albeit in my case , it was ultimately a failed one . Joselyn is right there with the encouragement . “
64202	64203	64196	64196	We	1143	” “
64206	64220	64196	64196	We	1143	” He bounces on his toes , running back to catch her hand . “
64233	64287	64196	64196	We	1143	” She drags out the map , and I admire her devotion to helping them . I sent Tom the Tank with Courtney this morning . He ’ll make sure she arrives and returns safely , and while she ’s working , he ’s on break . I ’ve got these two covered . “
64297	64329	64330	64330	He	1144	” Joselyn points towards the giraffe exhibit , and Ollie takes off running . My throat tightens when he rounds a curve up ahead and we temporarily lose sight of him . “
64347	64348	64350	64350	my	1454	” “
64357	64420	64353	64353	you	1145	” She takes off jogging at once , and I groan as I break into a run after her . My Italian leather slip - ons are not designed for sprinting . As soon as I round the corner , my chest relaxes . Oliver is standing on a sculpted - stucco rock formation , gazing into a pen of black panthers . “
64432	64457	64429	64429	Wakanda	210	” He pumps a fist in the air , and I have no idea what he ’s talking about . Joselyn reads my expression . “
64467	64468	64464	64465	Black Panther	100	” “
64481	64482	64464	64465	Black Panther	100	” “

64519	64525	64526	64526	He	100	” I lift my chin . “
64534	64547	64526	64526	He	100	” She points back at me as she takes off after him . “
64590	64591	64581	64581	They	1534	” “
64607	64644	64604	64604	you	1145	” I motion towards our escaping little ward , and she shakes her gorgeous head , taking off after him . We ’re finally back together at the zebra exhibit , and I ca n’t resist . “
64653	64660	64604	64604	you	1145	” Joselyn musses Oliver ’s hair . “
64680	64697	64698	64698	I	1454	” The little boy stands on the edge of the fence watching the small horses enraptured . “
64706	64707	64698	64698	I	1454	” “
64716	64731	64708	64708	They	1534	” Joselyn ’s nose wrinkles , and I like seeing her relaxed and happy . “
64740	64770	64771	64771	They	1534	” An ostrich walks slowly between two of the striped horses , lifting its powerful legs and replacing them slowly , turning its head jerkily . Oliver is transfixed . “
64776	64797	64771	64771	They	1534	” We watch a little longer before turning away and entering the aquatic zone , and Joselyn claps her hands . “
64807	64821	64805	64805	Ollie	374	” He jumps and starts to run , but she grabs him fast . “
64843	64888	64889	64889	I	1454	” The little boy blinks a few times before nodding obediently , and to his credit , he ’s at our side the remainder of the trip — which tells me all I need to know about how much he knows about their situation . “
64897	64909	64889	64889	I	1454	” I arch an eyebrow , and she waves me away . “
64917	64981	64889	64889	I	1454	” We see alligators , enormous green pythons , tree frogs , and of course , an adorable koala bear baby . It ’s a full afternoon of walking — or in Oliver ’s case , running , jumping , and climbing — and by the time we ’re driving back to my place , he ’s out cold on the backseat of my “
64986	65021	64889	64889	I	1454	” as he calls it . Something to do with the inventor sending bored billionaires into space . Joselyn looks up at me from where she ’s sitting quietly in the passenger ’s seat . “
65057	65071	65046	65055	a nice man outside of the teachers at his school	1152	” Her words provoke a sad nostalgia , but I force a smile . “
65078	65086	65046	65055	a nice man outside of the teachers at his school	1152	” She squints an eye at me . “
65099	65157	65046	65055	a nice man outside of the teachers at his school	1152	” It ’s uncanny how this woman can read my expressions . I ’m accustomed to watching people , reading them for any change , any indication I need to take control of the situation . It ’s a reflex honed after years of survival , and I ’m not used to it being turned on me . “
65172	65173	65161	65161	I	1454	” “
65178	65254	65161	65161	I	1454	” Her brow furrows , and concern fills her pretty eyes . My throat constricts , and a flight response seizes me . I ’ve cracked the door on a past I locked away long ago , and I ’m not planning to revisit it . I do n’t know what the hell made me do it , and knowing Joselyn , she wo n’t let it go . Thankfully , Oliver interrupts our conversation . “
65261	65262	65161	65161	I	1454	” “
65266	65280	65161	65161	I	1454	” I lift my chin , meeting his eyes in the rearview mirror . “
65300	65301	65161	65161	I	1454	” “
65311	65324	65303	65304	Mr. Julian	213	” His little brow furrows like it ’s a wholly new concept . “
65348	65349	65339	65339	I	1454	” “
65360	65374	65339	65339	I	1454	” I see Joselyn covering her mouth , and I shake my head . “
65389	65390	65339	65339	I	1454	” “
65395	65404	65339	65339	I	1454	” Oliver trails off attempting to repeat me . “
65412	65413	65339	65339	I	1454	” “
65421	65430	65433	65433	I	1454	” My lips quirk . He ’s smart . “
65446	65456	65440	65440	I	1454	” Joselyn ’s face lights up with a smile . “
65471	65472	65440	65440	I	1454	” “
65496	65554	65555	65555	Mom	102	” We ’re back at the house , and Courtney ’s car is in the garage . We left Joselyn ’s ridiculous bomb of a minivan back at the apartment complex to throw the ex off our trail . I ca n’t imagine him looking for them here , although I ’d welcome a confrontation with him . “
65559	65586	65555	65555	Mom	102	” Ollie sits up straighter in his seat . I turn off the engine and close the garage before letting him out — just in case . “
65608	65624	65598	65598	Julian	213	” He jumps out of the car , and Joselyn gives me a warm smile . “
65635	65636	65637	65637	You	102	” “
65672	65738	65637	65637	You	102	” Her lips press into a line like she ’s fighting a grin , and I ’m not sure if she believes me . It does n’t matter . I need to know if the private investigator I hired turned up anything on Ozzy Clayton . I have no intention of letting that guy get away with what he did to her . Chapter 25 Joselyn “
65745	65761	65637	65637	You	102	” Ollie is sitting on the couch across from Spencer with his little legs crossed . “
65782	65843	65771	65771	They	1159	” Spencer looks like end - of - the - day - CEO slash sex - god in dress pants and a white shirt unbuttoned at the neck . His sleeves are rolled up exposing his lined forearms dusted with dark hair , but for all his overt , alpha masculinity , his nose curls at Ollie ’s fun fact . “
65853	65884	65885	65886	Caramel Cone	214	” I pinch my nose so I do n’t laugh . Chartreuse is perched on the lid of her box on the coffee table while Ollie finishes up his Häägen Daz “
65887	65977	65885	65886	Caramel Cone	214	” ice cream . Julien might not have made it himself , but he nuked it for fifteen seconds , making the ingredients all squishy and warm inside the frozen vanilla … One bite , and I ’m pretty sure my eyes rolled back in my head . I know my toes curled . Spencer is having a tumbler of what looks like scotch , and they ’re watching some nature show on Netflix with the sound off . Ollie scrapes the last of his ice cream , nodding . “
65986	65987	65885	65886	Caramel Cone	214	” “
65994	66009	65989	65989	somebody	1587	” I make a face popping into the room in my Unsolved Mysteries pajamas . “
66024	66043	65989	65989	somebody	1587	” Ollie sits up , scooping Chartreuse off her perch and moving away from me on the couch . “
66049	66050	66051	66051	I	1454	” “
66060	66101	66051	66051	I	1454	” I take his moist bowl off the mahogany table so it does n’t leave a ring . I ’m betting the table is worth something outrageous like ten thousand dollars — like everything else in this mini - museum . “
66110	66111	66051	66051	I	1454	” “
66117	66143	66051	66051	I	1454	” Spencer ’s tone is critical as he narrows his eyes at my black flannel pajamas with the bright yellow show logo all over them . “
66149	66159	66051	66051	I	1454	” I announce proudly , doing a little turn . “
66163	66164	66051	66051	I	1454	” “
66174	66180	66051	66051	I	1454	” Ollie groans falling back . “
66185	66198	66199	66199	They	1165	” When I turn back , a smile curls Spencer ’s lips . “
66206	66207	66199	66199	They	1165	” “
66216	66238	66239	66239	I	1454	” I put a hand on my hip not caring one bit that I ’m comfortable and completely covered in flannel . “
66254	66274	66275	66275	Women	353	” I leave the room with my nose in the air , and I hear Ollie behind me muttering . “
66281	66327	66328	66328	You	1168	” The beleaguered tone in his little voice almost makes me cackle . Instead I rinse the bowl in the oversized stainless - steel sink and place it in the dishwasher . On my way back , I slow down when I hear them talking . “
66336	66346	66328	66328	You	1168	” Spencer is being kind , and I smile . “
66361	66370	66371	66371	You	1168	” Ollie studies Chartreuse walking on his fingers . “
66389	66431	66383	66383	you	1168	” My nose wrinkles , and I wish I could see Spencer ’s expression . I ca n’t , and I do n’t want to interrupt them . I ’m stuck in the hallway , chewing my thumb as I listen . “
66439	66454	66383	66383	you	1168	” Spencer ’s question is easy , like he and Ollie are old friends . “
66457	66464	66465	66465	Mom	102	” Ollie ’s voice is quiet . “
66471	66472	66467	66467	I	1454	” “
66490	66491	66492	66492	She	102	” “
66509	66510	66502	66503	My dad	1963	” “
66518	66533	66534	66534	I	1454	” Ollie tilts his little head to the side and looks straight at Spencer . “
66560	66594	66550	66550	I	1454	” To his credit , Spencer does n’t answer right away . It ’s quiet for the passage of several heartbeats , and I imagine him thinking about what our little friend said . “
66602	66614	66615	66615	You	1168	” Spencer ’s voice is grave , and my heart hurts . “
66618	66619	66620	66620	I	1454	” “
66623	66654	66620	66620	I	1454	” He clears his throat , and I hear him shift in the leather chair . His voice grows calm , and I recognize now it ’s a defense mechanism . “
66697	66765	66693	66695	a good dad	1179	” Ollie moves around , sitting back on the couch where I can see him better , and when he lifts his chin to the television , the tension has left his brow . My eyes warm , and I want to rush in and kiss Spencer ’s face . I might even beg for it . Instead , I clear my throat to announce my return . “
66774	66775	66693	66695	a good dad	1179	” “
66778	66787	66693	66695	a good dad	1179	” Ollie groans , turning to face me . “
66803	66804	66794	66794	They	1180	” “
66812	66828	66805	66805	You	1181	” I take my place as far from him and his creepy pet as possible . “
66836	66837	66805	66805	You	1181	” “
66845	66846	66805	66805	You	1181	” “
66855	66863	66805	66805	You	1181	” I shake my head at him . “
66879	66889	66868	66868	they	1180	” Ollie exhales heavily like he ’s so disgusted . “
66897	66898	66868	66868	they	1180	” “
66904	66914	66868	66868	they	1180	” Courtney sticks her head out of her room . “
66937	66938	66929	66929	you	216	” “
66945	66980	66943	66943	Mom	102	” He calls , studying his frog stepping from his fingers with careful , shaky moves . I do n’t know if she ’s growing on me , but Chartreuse is fascinating to watch . “
66992	66998	66943	66943	Mom	102	” Courtney lifts her chin . “
67017	67018	66943	66943	Mom	102	” “
67023	67032	67033	67033	I	1454	” I call , standing beside the sofa . “
67055	67136	67051	67051	I	1454	” I glance over to where Spencer seems lost in thought . He ’s so handsome , I wonder what would happen if I bent my rules , especially in view of how amazing he was just now with Oliver . I ’m about to say something along those lines when he stands . A lock of dark hair has fallen over his eye , and he pushes it back , his heavy stainless watch gleaming in the dim light . “
67163	67187	67153	67153	I	1454	” He pauses as he passes me , lifting the collar of my pajama top and giving me a ghost of a smile . “
67196	67293	67188	67188	I	1454	” I want to catch his hand and bring it to my lips . I want to find what he ’s hiding from me , from everyone , and shelter it . He gave me the tiniest peek in the car today . I want to tell him , You are safe with me … Warmth aches in my chest for everything he ’s done , from this safe place to the ice cream to the reassuring chat with Ollie . I want to tell him so many things , but he does n’t allow it . “
67297	67513	67514	67514	I	1454	” His tone is final as he turns away , climbing the stairs to his tower . I need to get this box out of my car . Elliot ’s text is in my face , and I growl as I tap out a reply . I ’m helping Courtney with her son . The last thing I want is to see Idiot Flick . Send me the address of where you are , and I ’ll be there in ten minutes . How can he know he ’ll be here in ten minutes ? Either way , I text him Spencer ’s address . Tell me when you ’re here , and I ’ll come out to meet you . Gray dots float on the screen , and his asshole reply appears . I can meet you at the door like a civilized person . My jaw clenches and I ca n’t even resist . You are not a civilized person . He does n’t reply , and I go to my room , stomping and huffing . I do n’t want to see his ass . I want him to drive off a cliff and his car to explode . None of that happens , and ten minutes later , the doorbell rings . “
67519	67566	67514	67514	I	1454	” It ’s just Ollie , Tom the Tank , and me at the house today , and I take off to the front entrance . Tom materializes between me and it like some kind of phantom , and I hop back with a little yelp . “
67573	67596	67600	67600	someone	389	” I put a hand on my chest , breathless . His brow lowers , and he does n’t answer my question . “
67602	67603	67600	67600	someone	389	” “
67606	67614	67600	67600	someone	389	” I pat him on the shoulder . “
67646	67726	67636	67636	him	295	” His brow lowers , and I realize this guy has no sense of humor . None . I ’m not sure I ’m going to take back what I just said , though . Pulling the heavy door open , I ’m pissed when I see Elliot standing there in an Armani suit looking as polished as he always did . His light brown hair is carefully styled , and he looks around at the yard and driveway . “
67733	67746	67729	67729	Courtney	414	” He turns back , his full lips twisted in a scowl . “
67760	67794	67729	67729	Courtney	414	” No , asshole , I made that mistake with you . The fact he even uses that derogatory term says a lot , but I wo n’t let him get to me . “
67816	67852	67853	67853	Nadine	97	” I ’m impressed by how unaffected I sound … How unaffected I am by his cheating presence . He has effectively killed any love I might have had for him all those months ago . “
67865	67898	67853	67853	Nadine	97	” He lifts a small box and holds it out to me . Her name , the scenario he describes … I hate that it hurts , but I smile through it . “
67907	67908	67853	67853	Nadine	97	” “
67937	67972	67913	67913	she	97	” His phrasing roils my stomach . Nadine can fuck right off if she thinks I would ever want this idiot back . I manage a little laugh at the absurdity of the suggestion . “
67979	67980	67913	67913	she	97	” “
67987	68040	67913	67913	she	97	” He shoves the box towards me , and as my luck would have it , a black Tesla pulls into the driveway right behind his Mercedes . My ex glances over , and when he sees Spencer stepping out of the luxury car , he turns to me with a sneer . “
68052	68064	68050	68050	you	414	” Lifting his chin , he gives me a slimy wink . “
68071	68078	68079	68079	I	1454	” Heat burns in my face . “
68089	68090	68079	68079	I	1454	” “
68112	68113	68079	68079	I	1454	” “
68119	68128	68079	68079	I	1454	” I shove my hair behind my ear . “
68143	68144	68135	68135	I	1454	” “
68159	68167	68135	68135	I	1454	” My body flashes hot then cold . “
68182	68183	68175	68175	He	1195	” “
68195	68208	68175	68175	He	1195	” Elliot lifts his chin , grinning like a fucking Cheshire cat . “
68216	68217	68218	68219	You asshole	316	” “
68221	68232	68233	68233	You	414	” My fist tightens , my voice a heated whisper . “
68241	68242	68244	68244	you	414	” “
68252	68281	68244	68244	you	414	” Spencer walks up to where we ’re standing , and as always , he reads my face quickly . He can tell at once something is wrong . “
68287	68301	68304	68304	man	414	” He takes a step forward , partially blocking me from the idiot . “
68306	68314	68315	68315	I	1454	” Elliot tosses his chin at me . “
68324	68395	68398	68399	that man	414	” Elliot turns and saunters to his Mercedes . The door slams , the engine roars , and he squeals tires getting out of the driveway . My eyes close in the wake of his departure , and I fight back a tear . How could I have been such a fool ? Strong hands brace my upper arms , and I blink up to see Spencer studying my face . “
68401	68416	68398	68399	that man	414	” Shaking my head , I turn , carrying the box into the house . “
68424	68461	68398	68399	that man	414	” I pass Tom waiting with both fists clenched at his side . I ’m sure he had a front - row seat to my humiliation . Spencer gives him a nod , following me inside . “
68467	68468	68469	68469	He	1198	” “
68474	68515	68469	68469	He	1198	” I put the box on the formal dining room table , wondering what in the world I left that Nadine was so worried I might go back to get . Glad to know she ’s feeling secure . Sarcasm . “
68518	68623	68624	68624	I	1454	” Spencer catches my arm , pulling me so I have to face him . His dark brow is lowered . His hazel eyes are stormy and full of protective worry . He looks like a man who cares , a man who would sit up at night , even if he was tired , to comfort a scared little boy and help him feel better . He looks like a man who would figure out a way to get ice cream on a moment ’s notice . He looks like a man who knows how to be good … Why is n’t he ? “
68633	68646	68624	68624	I	1454	” My teeth clench , and an old bitterness tightens my throat . “
68657	68658	68659	68659	I	1454	” “
68683	68684	68675	68675	I	1454	” “
68698	68713	68675	68675	I	1454	” His eyes flash with anger , and he steps forward , jaw tight . “
68723	68724	68718	68718	I	1454	” “
68740	68741	68737	68738	Fucking Elliot	58	” “
68788	68823	68781	68781	I	1454	” We ’re both breathing fast , our bodies so close the heat radiates between us . I ’m ready to collapse into his arms when a soft throat - clearing breaks the spell . “
68831	68855	68856	68856	I	1454	” Tom the Tank stands at the doorway , seeming embarrassed and satisfied at the same time . It ’s an odd combination . “
68860	69151	69152	69152	Spencer	621	” Turning on my heel , I storm all the way to my room and shut the door . When I open my eyes again , it ’s dark . Grabbing the clock , I ca n’t believe it ’s after nine . I came back here , curled up in my bed , and cried until I fell asleep — all over that idiot and his harpy girlfriend , which is so dumb . So , so dumb . The box he brought is sitting on the floor beside my bed , and I consider taking it outside and burning it . I do n’t want anything they ’ve touched . Ollie is snoring in his bed across the room , and I creep as quietly as possible out the door . I ’m not starving , but I ’m awake , and I did n’t have dinner . Maybe I can find some of that ice cream Julien bought . It ’s one of the only two things that could make me feel better right now . Creeping towards the kitchen , I stop short when I hear the clink of ice against crystal . Spencer is sitting in the same leather chair he was in last night when I watched him be so amazing with Oliver . Again , he ’s in a dress shirt — light blue this time — with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows . His hair is a delicious mess of dark waves dropping over his dark brow . Scruff covers his square jaw , and he seems perplexed . On the large screen attached to the wall is that nature show he and Ollie were watching , still on silent . “
69154	69183	69184	69184	I	1454	” My voice is quiet , and I walk closer to where he ’s sitting , seeming lost . At the sound of my voice , he straightens . “
69199	69211	69195	69195	I	1454	” My lips press together , and I shake my head . “
69230	69279	69280	69280	I	1454	” I shrug and exhale a laugh . He does n’t smile . He studies me like I ’m something he ca n’t understand , like I ’m something he ’s never seen before . With an exhale and a shake of his head , it ’s gone . “
69303	69347	69292	69292	I	1454	” I take a step towards the kitchen , but then I stop . It ’s late , and we ’re both tired . He ’s had a glass of scotch … it seems like as good a time as any to ask . “
69361	69472	69358	69358	you	1205	” His expression is closed , and I feel certain he ’s not going to tell me . The room is quiet , and the tall , gold - faced grandfather clock beside the bookcase ticks loudly . My eyes flick to the television screen as a school of brilliantly colored fish swish past . Nothing happens . Still , I wait , hoping he ’ll tell me , preparing for him not to , wishing he would , wishing he would trust me enough to let me in those walls again . My shoulders drop , and when I ’ve decided it ’s a lost cause , he speaks . “
69478	69504	69505	69505	He	253	” It ’s a quiet statement of fact , but my breath stills . I do n’t know what to say , and he continues . “
69517	69531	69505	69505	He	253	” His expression is neutral as he tilts the crystal back and forth . “
69563	69593	69558	69558	he	253	” His eyes focus on the brilliant Persian rug on the floor , and he lifts the tumbler to take a small sip . He seems so far away . “
69599	69600	69601	69601	I	1454	” “
69614	69635	69607	69607	they	1209	” I think about what he ’s told me , what I know about him , and I ’m confused . “
69657	69658	69650	69650	he	1829	” “
69693	69718	69687	69687	Drake	56	” Sadness tightens my chest , and I have no words . He continues calmly , like he ’s reading from a history book . “
69754	69762	69746	69746	I	1454	” Closing my eyes , I realize . “
69769	69811	69746	69746	I	1454	” Hazel eyes flicker to mine , and they ’re so deep , I ’m not sure what I ’m seeing . I only know this is sacred ground we ’re treading . He ’s taking me into a hidden place . “
69887	69956	69957	69957	He	56	” His eyes move to the shelves filled with what I ’d always assumed were treasures he ’d collected . I want to argue with him , to try and say he must be wrong . Instead , I listen , dropping to my knees beside him as he escorts me through this dusty , dark place in his past , this shadowy corner where the ghosts live . “
69999	70009	70010	70010	He	56	” Spencer places the glass on the end table . “
70041	70042	70046	70046	they	1218	” “
70052	70059	70060	70060	They	1218	” My voice is so small . “
70072	70073	70075	70075	they	1218	” “
70089	70101	70080	70080	they	1218	” He looks down at me and lifts his empty hand . “
70104	70149	70150	70150	I	1454	” With the tips of his fingers , he touches the edge of my hair along my cheek . I tilt my head to the side and give him a small smile . I want to comfort him if only he would let me . “
70165	70166	70150	70150	I	1454	” “
70175	70185	70167	70167	You	1220	” Warmth fills my tone , warmth and longing . “
70194	70199	70203	70204	an abuser	1223	” His expression hardens . “
70240	70241	70232	70232	I	1454	” “
70279	70280	70267	70267	I	1454	” “
70295	70296	70292	70292	my	1454	” “
70344	70356	70359	70359	Elliot	58	” His chin lifts , and he exhales a little ah . “
70365	70366	70359	70359	Elliot	58	” “
70382	70383	70376	70376	You	1228	” “
70401	70424	70396	70396	I	1454	” The tone in his voice sends a tingle through my stomach , and I ’m ready to fight for this man . “
70439	70460	70435	70435	Hades	223	” A grim smile curls his full lips . He pushes the dark hair off his brow and stands slowly . “
70495	70496	70486	70486	I	1454	” “
70508	70523	70524	70524	I	1454	” Pushing off the floor , I stand beside him , holding his arm . “
70527	70533	70536	70536	Joselyn	177	” He pats my hand . “
70538	71052	70536	70536	Joselyn	177	” My jaw drops as he crosses the room to the stairs , climbing slowly to his suite alone . I watch him disappear into the darkness , like he ’s done every night we ’ve been here . So respectful . So distant . So cold . Only , I understand now , and he ’s dead wrong if he thinks I ’m giving up on him , especially now that I know what I ’m fighting against . Chapter 26 Spencer Having them here is not how I thought it would be . Of course , that ’s assuming I thought it through before I took one look at Joselyn ’s battered face and lost my shit . It was an impulsive decision , and now her presence one floor down , one bedroom below mine , is a constant temptation . At the same time , Oliver is a constant reminder . He ’s a tiny skeleton key slipping in and unlocking a lifetime ’s worth of memories . I ’ve felt everything he ’s feeling . I ’m well acquainted with all of his fears . I faced the dread he ’s struggling with , only he ’s in the very early stages of figuring out what it means , how his future will go . I know where that lonely road leads . I know the questions he ’s asking himself . In my case , I never had anyone to show me what real love and sacrifice could look like . I went from a home where my mother chose a monster over me and herself . Then I lived with a bitter old man , a different type of monster , who clutched his valuables to himself like they would keep him alive . Oliver wo n’t be like me . He has his mother and Joselyn to show him love and teach him a different way to live . Stopping at the credenza , I brace my hands on the countertop and grip the wood . My shoulders are tense , and I drop my head , exhaling heavily . Not only did I revisit Daniel , I revisited Drake . My two dads , both with names starting with the letter D like some sick joke . In those days , I had hope like Oliver . When the woman from the state introduced me to my foster dad , I thought I was going to be like one of those children in the C.S. Lewis stories . Drake was an old professor type with a gray beard and disheveled gray hair . He pointed a long , crooked finger at me like I was a Limoges or a Qing dynasty vase . He picked me out like he picked out all of his possessions , after much careful analysis and research . He ascertained I was intelligent and quiet . He taught me everything he knew , then he died . He left me richer , and more broken than he ever was . “
71064	71101	70536	70536	Joselyn	177	” Her soft voice lights my entire body like the touch of a spark . Joselyn is beside me , sliding her hand over mine , gripping my wrist as her body draws closer to mine . “
71108	71114	71115	71115	I	1454	” My voice is rough . “
71121	71138	71139	71139	Joselyn	177	” Slim fingers thread in the back of my hair , and my eyes slide closed . “
71141	71150	71151	71151	I	1454	” It ’s half whisper , half groan . “
71159	71160	71151	71151	I	1454	” “
71174	71191	71170	71170	I	1454	” She rises on her tiptoes , and her lips graze the shell of my ear . “
71201	71268	71194	71195	Mr. Carrollton	119	” Inhaling slowly , I turn to see her standing in front of me , so inviting . She ’s wearing a black tank top that barely covers those luscious tits I crave and her silly Unsolved Mysteries pajama bottoms . Her red hair is in a loose band over her shoulder . She ’s the best thing I ’ve ever seen . I actually smile . “
71276	71277	71269	71269	You	1229	” “
71284	71305	71306	71306	You	1229	” Placing my hands on her shoulders , I slide my palms up and down her creamy , soft skin . “
71312	71313	71306	71306	You	1229	” “
71317	71328	71329	71329	You	1229	” She blinks , giving me a naughty little smile . “
71346	71417	71338	71338	I	1454	” My walls are still down . I have n’t had a chance to rebuild my defenses , and she ’s here , inside the gates , moving in front of me with so much heat and warmth and seduction . I ’m never vulnerable . I ’m cold and distant , and she ’s standing on my mountain daring me to throw her off … or take her in . “
71425	71434	71435	71435	I	1454	” I hear the change in my voice . “
71445	71533	71435	71435	I	1454	” Her hands slide to my chest , and she lowers to her knees . As she drops , her palms follow , moving to my waist , to my legs , to the front of my pants . Her face is at my cock , which has perked up and is ready to join the party . The last time she was in this position , she talked into it like a microphone . And I laughed . Again , a smile pulls at my lips . “
71539	71540	71541	71541	You	1229	” “
71547	71570	71544	71544	I	1454	” Her eyes return to my pants , and her nails trace the outline of my erection . It makes me groan . “
71575	71591	71544	71544	I	1454	” Reaching down , I grip her upper arms again and pull her to me . “
71600	71653	71544	71544	I	1454	” Our noses touch , and she ’s breathing fast . She nods quickly , blinking from my eyes to my lips and back again . Her breasts rise and fall , sheathed only in thin black cotton . Her nipples are tiny points piercing the fabric . She exhales a reply . “
71658	71726	71727	71727	You	1231	” My lips cover hers at once , consuming her request . Releasing my grip on her arms , I slide my hands up to her neck , to her jaw , holding her face securely . Her mouth opens , and I sweep my tongue inside , tasting sweet caramel ice cream . Pulling her lips with mine , I kiss her cheek , her nose . “
71733	71745	71746	71746	I	1454	” My lips travel to her eyelids , which are closed . “
71751	71757	71746	71746	I	1454	” Her voice is breathy . “
71767	71891	71759	71759	I	1454	” Leaning down , I kiss her again . This time , I drive my fingers into her hair , tilting her head so I can consume her more fully . Her head drops back , but her body presses forward against mine . She grips my wrists with her hands , exhaling a soft moan as she pulls me closer . Only one way can I get closer . Our tongues curl , and I nip at her upper lip with my teeth . She makes me hungry . She makes me feral . She makes me want to mark her body with my teeth , my hands . Lifting my head , I meet her eyes , now navy with desire . “
71903	71904	71901	71901	I	1454	” “
71907	71976	71901	71901	I	1454	” She does n’t hesitate . Catching the bottom of her tank top , I lift it over her head , allowing those luscious girls to spill out . I want to drop to my knees , but I lift her into my arms instead , carrying her to my bed , where she should always be . I ’m not analyzing that statement too closely right now . “
71980	72000	71901	71901	I	1454	” She reaches for me , and out of curiosity , I stop what I ’m doing to comply . “
72007	72063	71901	71901	I	1454	” She unbuttons my shirt starting at the top , following the progress of her fingers with her lips against my heated skin . When she gets to the bottom , she slides her tongue over my stomach , kissing a line around the waist of my pants and sending my dick to full mast . “
72066	72089	72090	72090	I	1454	” I hiss , closing my eyes . I place my hands beside her ears , threading my fingers in her hair . “
72100	72117	72120	72120	guy	1233	” My thigh muscles twitch when she cups my cock with her palm over my pants . “
72127	72205	72124	72125	the boss	1233	” A deep laugh rolls up from my belly , and I grip her under the arms , pulling her to her knees on the side of the bed , placing her face directly across from mine . Her blue eyes sparkle with horny mischief , and I ’m smiling . I ’m actually fucking smiling after that trip through my macabre past . My eyes are on her , and she ’s blinking up at me . “
72211	72212	72124	72125	the boss	1233	” “
72216	72342	72124	72125	the boss	1233	” I ’m not sure if my words are meant for her or for me . I ’ve thought about this so many times , and it ’s too late for turning back . My shirt is off , and I pull her to me . Her breasts flatten against my hard chest , and I feel her hands moving fast , working to unfasten my pants and push them down my hips . Stepping back , I quickly finish the job , shoving them to the side , and going to the nightstand to grab a condom from the drawer . Ripping it open , I hesitate when I see her perched on the edge of the bed watching me , licking her lips . “
72353	72354	72124	72125	the boss	1233	” “
72362	72521	72124	72125	the boss	1233	” I approach the bed , and she rises onto her knees . While I grabbed the condom , she removed her pajama pants . Now she ’s leaning forward , back arched , lifting her gorgeous tits up to me . Her mouth is luscious and tempting , her red hair falls around her shoulders , and her creamy little ass is soft as a peach . Normally , I would n’t know where to begin . Tonight , I catch her by the chin and kiss her slowly , growing firmer as my need flames hotter . I hold her waist , moving her onto her back on the bed , kissing her jaw , her neck , her shoulder as I make my way lower . Leaning down , I run my nose along the crease of her thigh , teasing her bare pussy with my breath . She moans and slides her ankles together . “
72527	72551	72552	72552	Spencer	221	” Placing my hands on her thighs , I spread them apart , leaning down to drag my tongue slowly over her clit . “
72554	72568	72552	72552	Spencer	221	” she gasps , her fingers shooting into the sides of my hair . “
72573	72600	72571	72571	God	93	” Her hips are quick to follow my tongue , and her fingers curl at my ears , growing more frantic as my tongue moves quicker . “
72605	72670	72571	72571	God	93	” She hiccups , and I slide my palms along the insides of her thighs . Her body spasms , and I can feel when the orgasm starts to rise . I feel her muscles flexing and trembling , I see her ass bucking . Her moans turn to little gasps , and I smile , moving my mouth away just before she climaxes . “
72675	72755	72571	72571	God	93	” She moans a complaint , but her fingers crawl along my sides , pulling me down to her body as I line up my dick and drive all the way into her clenching core . For a moment , I ca n’t move . It feels too good . It ’s like finding heaven . My forehead drops against her neck , and I inhale deeply , flowers mixed with sweat and sex . She truly is sinful . “
72761	73004	72571	72571	God	93	” Her ass bucks , and she whines , struggling to make me fuck her . I do n’t make her wait . I start to move , knowing I ’m so close to the edge , I wo n’t last long . My eyes close , and I ’m somewhere I ’ve never been . I ’m having sex with a woman , and I do n’t have her pinned to the wall , stomach first . I ’m not pulling her hair , keeping her face turned away from mine so I do n’t see her . Lifting my shoulders , I look down at her . A line pierces her brow , and her eyes are squinted . She ’s grinding hard , pulling my dick as much as I ’m pushing . Her hands grip my ass , and her back arches . Gorgeous tits rise to meet me , and I pull one into my mouth . I suck on her nipple , teasing the hardened peak with my teeth . She moans , moving faster . I wrap my arms around her back and move to my knees , drawing her onto my lap without ever losing contact . Her arms are on my shoulders now , and she smiles down at me as her hair spills around us like fire , like the sparks from that blowtorch , like the chemistry we ’ve always shared . “
73011	73059	73007	73007	I	1454	” She ’s riding me now , sliding forward on my cock . A dimple is in her cheek , and I lean up to kiss it . The movement sends me deeper into her tight , clenching heat , and I ca n’t hold back anymore . “
73066	73124	73007	73007	I	1454	” My chin drops and my hands grip her ass . I ’m moving her now , slamming her harder as the orgasm takes hold of my brain , as sensation rushes through my bloodstream , centering in my pelvis , driving into my cock , pulsing with so much force , I forget where I am . “
73129	73487	73007	73007	I	1454	” I cough , dropping my head forward as my soul spills into hers . This is more than scratching an itch or satisfying a primal urge . I do n’t remember anyone but her . It ’s only her . Has there ever been anyone else ? Her arms wrap around my shoulders , and I feel her clenching as she finishes . I hear her fluttered breaths , and I know she ’s with me in this place , melting with me . Sliding to the side , I dispose of the condom before returning to pull her into my arms . I ’m weary to my core from this night . Our fingers thread , and I ’m not ready to say all the things in my mind . I ’m not ready to look at what I ’ve done and decide what it means . I only want to hold her and sleep . A shaft of light streams in from the crack in my heavy , gray velvet curtains . I ’m lying on my side in my massive bed , and last night comes back in a rush . I turn , sliding my hand across the mattress , over cool sheets … I ’m reaching , searching . My throat tightens until … My fingers encounter her soft skin . Rolling over , I blink a few times at the woman beside me in this bed . Confusing warmth floods my chest , and a smile lifts my lips . She ’s fucking adorable . Her hand is tucked under her cheek , and a wavy lock of dark red hair falls over her eye . She ’s asleep in my bed . She did n’t sneak out again . Her skin is flawlessly white . Lifting my hand , I trace my finger along the top of her shoulder , and it rises slightly at my touch . Her blue eyes blink open , and when they meet mine , she smiles . I feel the smile still on my lips , and I push into a sitting position . “
73493	73526	73527	73527	Your	1237	” She pushes into a sitting position as well , that fiery hair dropping around her shoulders . A curl loops under her nipple , and my cock is ready to go . “
73533	73552	73527	73527	Your	1237	” She props an elbow on the top of the pillows and traces her finger down my chin . “
73560	73578	73555	73555	you	1237	” I capture her slim hand in mine , holding it to my lips for a kiss . “
73582	73660	73661	73661	Joselyn	177	” She scoots closer , cupping my face in her hand and pressing her forehead to my cheek . I wrap my arm around her , turning us so I ’m looking down into her face . Her eyes hold mine , and I trace a finger along her brow , down her cheek . I ’ve handled priceless heirlooms , one - of - a - kind artifacts , last pieces of million - dollar collections … “
73663	73704	73705	73705	Spencer	221	” My voice is gentle , but I do n’t know what comes next . These are uncharted waters , and I do n’t make deals I ca n’t predict . How do I say what I ’ve never said ? “
73707	73812	73813	73813	Mom	102	” Her voice lowers , and she ’s teasing , mocking my serious tone . Our eyes meet , and she blinks impishly . Her full lips press together like she ’s suppressing a laugh . I drop my chin , exhaling a groan , and I ’m ready to flip her over and spank her creamy , round ass . Then bite it . But first , I cover her lips with mine . My hand travels higher , cupping her breast . I ’m gearing up for another round when a sharp voice rings through the house like a fucking police siren . “
73822	73839	73817	73818	Aunt Sly	124	” Ollie ’s feet thud loudly up the hall then pause , almost like he remembers . “
73846	73874	73843	73844	Mr. Spencer	276	” At the first pounding of his seven - year - old feet on the stairs , we ’re out of the bed , scrambling for clothes . “
73878	73914	73915	73915	Ollie	374	” Joselyn ’s eyes are wide , and she has those flannel PJ pants on before I ’ve even located my Jockeys . A door flies open below , and Courtney stops his upward progress . “
73931	73932	73933	73934	Aunt Sly	124	” “
73950	73951	73947	73948	Superhero Tom	769	” “
73963	73986	73947	73948	Superhero Tom	769	” They descend the stairs , and a fully clothed Joselyn skips across the room to plant a kiss on my mouth . “
73994	74139	73987	73987	I	1454	” I catch her before she skips away , pulling her to me . Her chin lifts , and light twinkles in her blue eyes . She ’s happier than I ’ve seen her in a month , and dread pricks my chest . Cupping her face with my hand , I slide my thumb over her full bottom lip . She ’s so beautiful . Leaning down , I kiss her . I inhale her soft hair , and I hold her forehead to my cheek . Her hands clutch my arms , and I have to let her go . I hold a little longer , finding it difficult to take my hands away . But I do . My lips are warm from her kiss , and I turn to my armoire as she jogs down the stairs . Chapter 27 Joselyn “
74148	74209	74210	74210	Ollie	374	” Courtney murmurs , nudging me in the ribs as we stand in front of the coffee machine in the kitchen . Ollie is at the table sprinkling walnut pieces on top of the whipped cream he sprayed on top of the pure maple syrup he poured all over the massive chocolate chip pancakes Julien made for him . Again . “
74223	74237	74210	74210	Ollie	374	” I nod towards the table , ignoring her elbow and her question . “
74246	74271	74272	74272	I	1454	” I glance over my shoulder . Spencer always seems to materialize as soon as I start talking about him . Like the devil . “
74278	74355	74272	74272	I	1454	” Taking my cup , I walk slowly to where Ollie ’s sitting , glancing up the dark hallway and wondering when he might make an appearance . My heart is hammering , but I have to act normal . No fawning or crowding . His eyes were so stormy when he kissed me . We covered a lot of ground last night , and I do n’t want him to throw those walls back up . “
74362	74372	74272	74272	I	1454	” Court sighs , joining us at the table . “
74380	74381	74382	74382	I	1454	” “
74404	74405	74388	74388	CMT	227	” “
74408	74414	74415	74415	I	1454	” Ollie ’s nose wrinkles . “
74421	74422	74415	74415	I	1454	” “
74448	74466	74415	74415	I	1454	” Also , I ’m hoping I might sneak my hand into Spencer ’s during the show . “
74475	74488	74415	74415	I	1454	” Court drops her keys in her bag , and I nod . “
74497	74498	74499	74499	I	1454	” “
74506	74507	74499	74499	I	1454	” “
74509	74539	74499	74499	I	1454	” Tom enters as we ’re talking . He pauses at the coffee machine , but when he sees Courtney packing , he comes to where we ’re talking . “
74546	74547	74499	74499	I	1454	” “
74574	74575	74576	74576	I	1454	” “
74583	74611	74612	74612	Ollie	374	” My eyebrows rise , and I know this guy does n’t deviate from any rules . I guess Spencer would have his balls if he did . “
74644	74651	74634	74634	he	276	” Tom frowns down at me . “
74673	74681	74682	74682	He	119	” My heart drops with my jaw . “
74689	74690	74691	74691	He	119	” “
74712	74721	74722	74722	He	119	” Courtney ’s dark eyes flash to mine . “
74728	74729	74730	74730	He	119	” “
74739	74834	74730	74730	He	119	” Although , I was dressed and running downstairs before him . Heat climbs the back of my neck , and I swallow the knot in my throat . Courtney is watching me , so I force a smile . I blink my eyes , doing my very best to seem unaffected , rather than confused and hurt he left town for two days without a word after last night . God , I ’ve got to find us a new place to live . I step over and give her a quick hug . “
74858	74964	74851	74851	we	1251	” Skipping out of the room , I dash a stubborn tear off my cheek with the heel of my hand . I am not crying over him . I push into the bathroom and switch on the hot water , stripping out of my clothes and throwing them in a ball on the other side of the room . Grabbing the shampoo , I step into the steaming heat . I want his seductive scent of sandalwood and leather off me . I want it out of my hair . I ’m rebuilding my own resolve . We ’ll see who begs next time . “
74982	74995	74975	74978	all the other puppets	1253	” Ollie snorts , skipping along beside me and swinging my hand . “
75012	75013	75004	75004	I	1454	” “
75016	75024	75025	75025	I	1454	” I ’m not telling him otherwise . “
75029	75030	75025	75025	I	1454	” “
75036	75139	75025	75025	I	1454	” I ’m glad he ’s having another happy day . It ’s been years since I visited the CMT , back when it was in the Vista , closer to Spencer ’s home . The new , larger space in the park means the productions are more elaborate . We ’re walking through the park , along the red - brick canal path . Tom is never out of sight , but he gives us space . I almost want to call him to catch up and join us , but I do n’t . I let him do his job . “
75149	75188	75025	75025	I	1454	” Ollie takes off running towards the vendor as I slide my phone out of my pocket to check for any missed calls or texts . The face is blank , and my heart sinks a little more . “
75193	75308	75311	75311	Tom	769	” I promised myself I would n’t think about him again . Shoving the device into my pocket , I hurry to catch up with my little friend waiting at the hot dog vendor . One giant pretzel and a coney dog later , we ’re in the backseat of Tom ’s black town car headed back to our safe house . Staring out the window , I notice signs listing apartments for lease , and I wonder how long we ’re supposed to be in this holding pattern at Spencer ’s house . Ollie has fallen asleep on the arm rest , and I slide forward to where the glass divider is lowered . “
75313	75323	75311	75311	Tom	769	” He lifts his chin to meet my eyes . “
75335	75340	75341	75341	We	1256	” His brow furrows . “
75354	75355	75341	75341	We	1256	” “
75359	75386	75391	75392	Miss Winthrop	108	” My voice goes high , and I shake my head . He ’s got another thing coming if he thinks I ’m staying past Sunday . “
75394	75395	75391	75392	Miss Winthrop	108	” “
75413	75425	75408	75408	everybody	434	” Shaking my head , I scoot back in the seat . “
75441	75515	75516	75516	He	1259	” He does n’t answer . We ’re at the house , and I pick at a loose thread on my jeans , thinking about how Spencer swooped in and took charge , installing us here like helpless children . I was shaken and scared , and I let him . I ’m more angry than scared now . After dinner , when I present it to Courtney , she does not cooperate . “
75530	75542	75516	75516	He	1259	” She says it like it ’s the most normal thing . “
75557	75572	75573	75573	He	1259	” I ’m walking around the room , feeling hurt and mad and angry . “
75589	75597	75581	75581	He	1259	” Her lips press into a frown . “
75665	75688	75659	75659	I	1454	” For the first time , I see the tension in her eyes , and I feel bad for pressing the matter . “
75713	75714	75701	75701	I	1454	” “
75720	75736	75737	75737	I	1454	” Ollie ’s splashing and making noises from the jacuzzi tub , and she stands . “
75787	75788	75780	75780	I	1454	” “
75807	75815	75816	75816	I	1454	” She smiles , hugging my shoulders . “
75822	76141	75816	75816	I	1454	” Tightness is in my stomach , and I head to my shared room with Ollie . Who says I ca n’t start the search right now ? Pulling out my otherwise useless phone , I open the app and start swiping . My phone buzzing with a text startles me awake . I fell asleep last night searching for apartments , and I discovered Courtney was right . I need to get working . Lifting my phone , I hold my breath … Is it him ? It ’s not Spencer . My chest sinks , but it quickly rises when I see it ’s my first appointment at Palmetto . They send me a cool little client dossier . Mrs. Wolfe is a geriatric patient recovering from a hip replacement . Her upper body and shoulders are tense from the physical therapy … So nice not to have to collect all this information myself . I can plan my course of treatment and be ready when I see her Monday . Momentary disappointment forgotten … sort of … I choose to focus on the positive angle of preparing for a new client . Mrs. Wolfe sounds like a nice old lady and not a maniac who ’ll chase me into a women ’s restroom then down twenty - two flights of stairs . The memory gives me a shiver . Hopping out of bed , I quickly put on leggings and a sweatshirt . Stopping at the mirror , I sweep my hair into a ponytail . The bruise on my cheek is a faint yellow now , and the cut is healed . Courtney stopped bandaging it shortly after we came here . Perhaps that ’s why he could leave without a second thought . With the visible reminder of what happened gone , he forgot why he was so concerned in the first place . “
76144	76153	75816	75816	I	1454	” I say out loud to my reflection . “
76159	76160	75816	75816	I	1454	” “
76164	76176	76177	76178	Aunt Sly	124	” Ollie ’s voice is a whine from across the room . “
76184	76196	76177	76178	Aunt Sly	124	” I go quickly to put my hand on his forehead . “
76211	76223	76209	76209	Crampy	231	” He rolls to his side with his little brow tight . “
76229	76230	76239	76239	babe	384	” “
76241	76266	76267	76267	She	102	” Dropping to my knees , I try to smooth his bangs off his face , but he turns his face to the pillow . “
76285	76286	76287	76287	I	1454	” “
76292	76343	76287	76287	I	1454	” Chewing my lip , I want to say it ’s because he ate all the junk food in the world yesterday , starting with breakfast , but I do n’t . If he really is sick , I ’ll be eating those words later and feeling like an asshole . “
76365	76390	76360	76360	you	124	” He makes a groaning sound , and I guess he ’d be an extra special seven - year - old if he did . “
76400	76994	76360	76360	you	124	” I manage to track down a sleeve of saltines and a warm Coke . Scooching in the bed beside him , I put the nature show he likes on the big television in our room . His head is in my lap and my phone is beside me as we watch hour after hour of wildebeests running across the African prairie or neon schools of fish swirling in the ocean or his favorite tree frogs hiding in green leaves or climbing limbs . I ’m getting bored when I hear his little - boy snore and realize he ’s asleep . Sliding my hand under his torso , I ease out of the bed and quietly into the hall . Checking my phone , it ’s almost one . Courtney should be here soon . The house is dark and empty , and I guess Tom went to escort her from work . Walking through the elegant home , I stop at a built - in bookshelf . A round switch is beside it , and I twist it to turn on the recessed lights . A soft yellow glow illuminates a collection of antique trinkets . A large and shiny brass clock sits under a glass dome . A round spinner in the back seems to serve as the battery , and on the side is a plate reading Simon Willard . The shelf above holds a glowing purple vase with hobnails all down the sides . The lip curves dramatically and it ’s strangely beautiful . On the bottom shelf is a leather notebook , and when I open it , I see it ’s actually a ledger . Beside it is a lapis blue cloisonne pen . It ’s like a Mont Blanc , but with brass filigree and pale pink and green flowers etched in the sides . I know from Daisy ’s work this stuff is valuable . Considering what Spencer told me , it ’s probably worth several thousand dollars or more . Leaning my head to the side , I pick up the pen and turn it in my fingers . I wonder if he ’s ever even written with it or if it even works . Taking a step away , I walk along the hall to the stairs leading up to the master suite . Climbing slowly , I pass the small sitting area to the left with its balcony facing the river . The enormous , navy king - sized bed is perfectly made . No sign I was ever even here . I go to the bedside table that holds a blue and white porcelain lamp covered in Chinese lettering . I slide my finger along the top of the polished mahogany when I realize … He does n’t have a single picture . Lifting my chin , I look all around the bedroom , to the dresser , the nightstand on the other side of the bed , not even on the credenza in the sitting room . All these old things and not a single framed photo . Spencer said his foster dad was like one of those old dragons , and I imagine a thick , reptilian man curled up on a pile of gold coins , protecting them with all his might as his life slips away , as he never knew the little boy in his care . Dropping into the oversized leather chair , I pull up my knees , resting my cheek on them . “
77004	77080	77081	77081	Courtney	414	” I whisper . Sadness presses inside my chest , and I take out my phone . I ’m breaking my promise … But I was doing a shitty job keeping it anyway . My fingers tap quickly , and I hit send . Then I switch off the sound , lean my head to the side , and close my eyes . My head pops up , and I can tell it ’s late . “
77083	77333	77081	77081	Courtney	414	” The house is quiet , and it seems we ’re still alone . I quickly check my phone , but I do n’t have a text . Jogging quickly down the stairs , I hurry to our room . Ollie is still asleep in his bed , and I do n’t wake him . Fear is tight in my throat as I jog to the living area then into the kitchen . No one is here , I do n’t see a note , I do n’t see anything . Pulling out my phone again , it ’s after four . Courtney should have been here two hours ago . At least I know Tom is with her . I ca n’t imagine Ozzy or anybody being strong enough to overpower Tom . Still , I do n’t like it . If she ’d decided to go shopping or something , she ’d have told me . It feels wrong . Tapping quickly , I send a text to her . Everything okay ? I think about what she told me last night . It ’s been a long time since she heard from Ozzy — too long . She was worried about us disappearing without a trace , and we both know he wo n’t let her go without a fight . We might be here , Ollie might be homeschooling , but Ozzy still has Courtney ’s phone number . He still knows where she works . “
77338	77342	77081	77081	Courtney	414	” I whisper . “
77349	77607	77081	77081	Courtney	414	” Returning to the bedroom , I contemplate waking Ollie to see if he ’ll at least drink something . His little head is tucked in the pillow , and he ’s sweaty . I lean down and place my lips lightly against his forehead . He still is n’t feverish , and I take his cup and plate . I put Ollie ’s things in the sink and wash them quickly . I do n’t feel worried about us here . Spencer has state - of - the - art security , and we ’re surrounded by metal gates . Still , I ca n’t relax . I wo n’t feel better until Courtney checks in with me . Walking to the living room , I sit in the window seat , looking out at the perfectly groomed yard . Leaning my head on my hand , I push back against the fear . Tom is with her . Nobody could get past him . I just ca n’t take much more of this radio silence . I ’m about to stand and start pacing all over again , when Tom ’s black town car swerves into the driveway fast . The massive gates close slowly behind him , but he ’s already out , racing around the back of the car . The door is open , and he dives in , pulling out Courtney . She ’s leaning heavily on him , and I ’m on my feet , racing to the front door . “
77611	77633	77081	77081	Courtney	414	” The words are out of my mouth , and I see a swarm of cars pulling up outside the gate . “
77639	77665	77081	77081	Courtney	414	” I do n’t have time to finish my sentence before Tom is past me , putting Courtney on her feet and slamming the door . “
77679	77712	77672	77672	Nobody	656	” My jaw drops , but Courtney ’s head against my shoulder snaps me out of it . I realize she ’s been crying , and only one person makes her cry . “
77717	77728	77731	77731	he	1276	” I search her face for any sign of injury . “
77734	77748	77749	77749	Courtney	414	” She shakes her head , and her eyes are heavy , miserable . “
77756	77783	77749	77749	Courtney	414	” Both her hands cover her face , and her shoulders hunch . A shiver moves through her body , and I give her a hug . “
77788	77801	77749	77749	Courtney	414	” I soothe , rubbing my hands up and down her back . “
77805	77861	77749	77749	Courtney	414	” We walk slowly to her bedroom , and I guide her to the bed where she sits on the foot . Then I step over to close the door . She ’s breathing more normally , and she clears her throat , blinking several times before lifting her chin to meet my worried eyes . “
77878	77891	77893	77893	you	1277	” I ’m ready to argue , but she grips my forearm . “
77895	77914	77893	77893	you	1277	” I blink back and forth between her dark eyes , placing my hand on top of hers . “
77918	77923	77893	77893	you	1277	” Her lips tighten . “
77931	77957	77893	77893	you	1277	” My chest squeezes , and I ’m not sure I can inhale . I know the answer , but I have to be sure . “
77961	77991	77992	77992	I	1454	” It ’s quiet . She ’s quiet . The tears coating her cheeks now are like a release , and when she speaks , it ’s calm resolution . “
78000	78001	77996	77996	He	101	” “
78006	78098	78004	78004	God	93	” It ’s a soft whisper , and I ’m so afraid . I ’m afraid of her being taken to jail . I ’m afraid of Ollie being taken away , even though I promised to take care of him . Can she give him to me ? Is that allowed ? I do n’t know what happens now , and I do n’t have anyone to ask . Actually , I do . This time when I send the text , it ’s for my friend . Chapter 28 Spencer “
78108	78142	78004	78004	God	93	” The mean old bastard sits across a glass partition from me , and I search his hazel eyes , exactly like mine , for anything I might recognize . I find nothing . “
78145	78153	78004	78004	God	93	” My answer is short , clipped . “
78157	78214	78215	78215	I	1454	” His shaggy , dark brows lower . His hair is long and cut in an old mullet style , and his gray beard grows into a point . He reminds me of one of those guys who used to fly drug planes between Houston and South America . Only he ’s in an orange jumpsuit . “
78225	78238	78221	78223	a rich man	1280	” He slides a pack of Parliament cigarettes out of his pocket . “
78247	78278	78221	78223	a rich man	1280	” He actually snarls , but I do n’t flinch . I ’ve never loved this biological contributor to my creation , and I ’m not afraid of him now . “
78294	78302	78221	78223	a rich man	1280	” He rocks back in the chair . “
78310	78318	78319	78319	My	1454	” I almost laugh at the suggestion . “
78335	78342	78327	78327	I	1454	” He holds out a hand . “
78350	78364	78327	78327	I	1454	” My eyes flicker to the beige Formica counter then to him again . “
78380	78418	78327	78327	I	1454	” The vulnerability inherent in my question makes me cringe . I hate that I fucking need to know the answer . The only gift this animal gave me was a deep and abiding mistrust of myself . “
78430	78444	78327	78327	I	1454	” He lights up , but the glass keeps it on his side . “
78486	78487	78479	78479	She	1739	” “
78506	78561	78495	78495	She	1739	” His eyes narrow , and my body instinctively reacts to the flash of anger in them . That flash was a prelude to one of us being slapped across the room . My throat heats , and I ’d love to shove these barriers out of the way and let him try it . “
78576	78587	78574	78574	boy	1290	” He lunges forward , speaking in a low hiss . “
78594	78608	78574	78574	boy	1290	” I lean back in my chair , relaxing into my cool grin . “
78629	78659	78626	78626	my	1454	” Our eyes clash and hold . We ’re locked in a silent battle for a moment , two … three … Until he sits back with a chuckle . “
78718	78799	78800	78800	I	1454	” I turn his words over in my mind , thinking about what they mean . Perhaps there was a time when this man was n’t a feral beast . Perhaps if that part of him had been stronger , I might feel a kinship . As it is , my insides are empty as a ghost town , and I have nothing for him but contempt . Standing , I slide my palm down the front of my blazer . “
78809	78837	78838	78838	You	1294	” I tap on the door , and a guard appears to open it . Stepping into the hall , I pause when he calls after me . “
78845	78846	78838	78838	You	1294	” “
78859	79543	78852	78852	I	1454	” I ’m speeding down the Interstate from Providence , turning east and following the highway farther out to the coast . After I settled my adopted father ’s estate , I swore I ’d never return to this strip of land on Aquidneck Island . When I was a kid , Drake avoided all activities on the island . He did n’t go to parties or host dinners . His castle - like manor was as silent as a tomb . It was n’t on Bellevue Avenue , where the Gilded Age mansions of the Vanderbilts and the Astors were located . He preferred a remote location farther south , where we were completely isolated . Every year , when the America ’s Cup would come to town , I ’d stand on the roof as the people gathered to watch the sailors race around the coast . He would be in his study admiring his latest find , and I would gaze down , longing for the world happening around us . I was a lonely church mouse , wandering his cavernous cathedral , caring for my father when he ’d had too much to drink or simply fallen asleep in his chair clutching his gold , then reading myself to sleep . The day after his lawyer read the will , leaving all of it to me , I got to work . I sold the mansion and almost everything in it . I had a few treasured items he ’d allowed me to play with as a child . The rest was gone , and I had enough money to buy the island . Turning the car into the cemetery , I follow the path slowly past the historic monuments . A life - sized statue of an angel covered in a green patina sits between two headstones , and I know I ’m on the right track . Drake had no family , but I found a deed to a plot in this esteemed burial site as I was going through his things . I took his urn and had a marble headstone fashioned for it . He did n’t leave an epitaph , so I installed a black granite obelisk with his name and dates engraved on it . When I see it , I park the rental car and step out , walking slowly to the quiet stretch of bright green grass . The landscape is perfectly manicured , and seagulls cry in the distance . I stop at the place where I planted his remains and read the marker , How terrible it is to love something death can not touch . It seemed like an appropriate epitaph . In life , he clung to things he could never take with him , and ultimately , he died the way he lived . Alone . Like me . Standing in front of the black stone , I think about what drove me here . Up until this point , I told myself I was n’t like this man . I did engage in human contact . I had carefully selected friends , I held a job , and when the need arose , I would have a woman in my bed . When I kissed Joselyn ’s lips and gazed into her eyes that morning , I had a startling realization — I wanted to be the man she believed me to be . With that realization , the loneliness of my childhood , the self - preservation instinct that kept me safe from the crushing pain of my mother ’s rejection , my father ’s dysfunction , and Drake ’s narcissism , yawned wide like a black hole . I did n’t know how to be that man . In my arrogance , I convinced myself I could accomplish anything , but lying in that bed , I realized my carefully constructed rules were a façade covering the truth . I do n’t know how to touch , to care like a normal human . “
79553	79744	79745	79745	You	1296	” My voice is quiet , and I do n’t really expect an answer . I do n’t expect closure here in this quiet field . I remember a little boy standing at the entrance of a massive , mahogany - lined office so hopeful . I remember Drake looking up at me with derision , asking if I wanted to play . I remember being ashamed to say yes , like wanting his attention was a weakness . Now my stomach burns with anger . It was n’t wrong to need someone . I had lost everything . If only I ’d had a sibling or even one extended family member . I had nothing but that shriveled reptile of a human whose heart had dried up long ago . Our interactions were reserved for formal walks through his mansion , while he pointed out his possessions and made special note of their value . He wanted to be sure his massive collection lived on after him . Then he died , and I was free . Only , the joke was on me . I ’m not free . “
79761	79850	79851	79851	He	1297	” Reading the epitaph again , I realize I wrote the words for me , for when I came here again as I knew I would one day . The real lesson I learned from this man is love must be shared with something that can be lost . Giving it to possessions only diminishes its value . Love becomes priceless when you have to earn the right to keep it . True love takes risk . It takes vulnerability . Only then have you found something irreplaceable . “
79860	79885	79851	79851	He	1297	” Heather stands on the other side of her mahogany desk , moving the heavy ring back and forth on the black velvet mat . “
79896	79897	79851	79851	He	1297	” “
79916	79934	79908	79908	I	1454	” Lifting the ring , I inspect the baguettes lining the sides for any sign of looseness . “
79949	79958	79944	79944	I	1454	” Heather slides it on her slim finger . “
79967	79968	79944	79944	I	1454	” “
79971	79983	79944	79944	I	1454	” My mind drifts to the last time I saw Joselyn . “
79990	79991	79944	79944	I	1454	” “
80014	80031	80001	80001	Lynn	233	” A smile fidgets at the corner of my mouth , and I shake my head . “
80046	80047	80048	80048	You	1296	” “
80052	80063	80048	80048	You	1296	” Her jaw drops , and she ’s so disappointed . “
80080	80081	80070	80070	I	1454	” “
80104	80105	80116	80116	Spence	104	” “
80118	80124	80116	80116	Spence	104	” I hate that diminutive . “
80133	80134	80116	80116	Spence	104	” “
80147	80148	80116	80116	Spence	104	” “
80170	80178	80163	80163	we	1301	” A smile breaks across her face . “
80188	80189	80163	80163	we	1301	” “
80195	80210	80192	80192	I	1454	” I hold out my hand , but she shakes her head in disgust . “
80252	80303	80306	80306	Heather	634	” If I ’m lucky . She has no idea . I ’m about to make a comment when my phone buzzes in my pocket . She texted me last night , but she did n’t want an answer . Now when I see her words , my shoulders tighten . “
80314	80349	80350	80350	He	1303	” Sliding the ring into my pocket , I make a quick call to the airport and arrange the private jet . The rest I ’ll handle on the flight home . Chapter 29 Joselyn “
80360	80538	80350	80350	He	1303	” Courtney ’s voice is so small in this enormous conference room . She sits across a wooden table from a team of lawyers led by an older woman in a St. John suit . The day after the incident , we took Ollie to stay with my mom in Fireside . Tom suggested it to get him away from the news and the reporters . Then Courtney and I moved to a penthouse suite in a downtown Westin , supposedly in case there was a backlash . Courtney and I were both confused , since as far as she knows , Ozzy has no family in the States . She was taken before a judge for arraignment , and now we ’re meeting with Spencer ’s team of lawyers in preparation for her preliminary hearing . All these things are happening at his direction , but I have n’t seen or heard from him . I ’ve become an expert at pretending I do n’t care . The female lawyer glances at a yellow legal pad . “
80557	80558	80550	80550	he	1876	” “
80577	80578	80572	80572	I	1454	” “
80608	80645	80646	80646	He	1876	” Courtney ’s chin drops , and I want to scoot forward in my chair and hold her hand , give her my reassurance . It ’s just the two of us here at this meeting . “
80655	80678	80646	80646	He	1876	” Her voice is a bit louder , a touch angrier , and I ’m surprised by her sudden show of strength . “
80690	80691	80679	80679	I	1454	” “
80698	80731	80732	80732	He	1876	” The woman ’s eyes never leave her notebook . She ’s impatient , and I want to throw something at her . My friend ’s shoulders droop , and she exhales . “
80750	80760	80742	80742	He	1876	” One of the younger male lawyers sits forward . “
80767	80768	80764	80765	Mrs. Clayton	234	” “
80775	80780	80764	80765	Mrs. Clayton	234	” Courtney interrupts him , “
80808	80809	80801	80801	You	1310	” “
80812	80819	80820	80821	Miss Shaw	911	” The guy makes a note . “
80836	80837	80838	80838	I	1454	” “
80861	80871	80857	80857	he	1876	” Courtney talks fast , like she ’s embarrassed . “
80906	80907	80900	80900	I	1454	” “
80924	80929	80909	80909	he	1876	” The guy repeats . “
80953	80954	80947	80947	I	1454	” “
80969	81044	81045	81045	We	1314	” The older woman is back in the lead . Courtney ’s eyes go to her lap again , and she does n’t answer right away . I want to jump in at this point and show them the pictures I took of her neck . I want to show them the pictures she took of my eye after Ozzy chased me into the women ’s restroom , but they have all the evidence . “
81065	81093	81054	81054	you	911	” She still hesitates , and this time I do scoot forward to hold her hand . She glances at me , giving me a weak smile . “
81136	81144	81126	81126	I	1454	” Her answer seems to satisfy them . “
81153	81177	81126	81126	I	1454	” Courtney sits on the end of the bed polishing her toenails . She ’s strangely calm , considering what she ’s facing . “
81208	81209	81210	81210	I	1454	” “
81221	81222	81210	81210	I	1454	” “
81232	81243	81244	81244	I	1454	” I exhale , dropping to the bed beside her . “
81266	81276	81277	81277	I	1454	” She shrugs , moving to her other foot . “
81304	81305	81298	81298	they	677	” “
81315	81316	81319	81319	I	1454	” “

81346	81371	81372	81372	He	276	” A pang of hurt cramps in my chest . She must hear it in my voice , because she frowns up at me . “
81379	81380	81372	81372	He	276	” “
81395	81403	81385	81385	I	1454	” Such a lie , but whatever . “
81421	81422	81423	81423	I	1454	” “
81442	81443	81429	81429	He	276	” “
81449	81450	81451	81451	Ollie	374	” “
81481	81500	81470	81470	Ollie	374	” My head is just spinning , and I do n’t know whether I ’m angry or touched . “
81507	81508	81511	81511	he	374	” “
81528	81538	81511	81511	he	374	” She blinks up at me with worried eyes . “
81560	81570	81551	81551	he	374	” Chewing my lip , I shake my head . “
81597	81609	81590	81590	I	1454	” Scooting closer , I put my arm around my friend . “
81629	81641	81650	81651	Courtney Shaw	414	” I just wo n’t be getting in his bed again . “
81662	81812	81653	81656	the honorable Beverly Wright	237	” The bailiff stands at the front of the empty courtroom , and the few of us in attendance stand . It ’s only me in the front row of the seats behind the railing separating the spectators from the small table where Courtney sits with her team of four well - dressed lawyers . Across the aisle from us , two disheveled attorneys in messy suits , hastily sort through papers . They seem disorganized and disinterested . I ’m having a hard time understanding why anyone would care that the world has one less abuser today . I guess that ’s why I do n’t work in law enforcement . The judge calls for the prosecution to present their case . A woman from the messy lawyer table with tightly curled hair and a pinched expression steps forward . She briefly outlines the case for the judge . “
81833	81845	81813	81814	Miss Shaw	911	” The woman acts like she knows anything about the situation . “
81881	81913	81914	81914	Your	1330	” I ’m ready to jump to my feet and yell that ’s not even close to the whole story when the judge turns the floor over to Courtney ’s attorney . “
81943	81957	81932	81933	Miss Shaw	911	” The woman steps over to a small projector and flips a switch . “
81981	81982	81988	81988	counsel	1637	” “
81990	82009	81988	81988	counsel	1637	” The judge lowers her gaze on Courtney ’s lawyer , and the woman holds out her hands . “
82060	82072	82073	82073	Your	911	” The male lawyer across the aisle jumps to his feet . “
82126	82162	82163	82163	Your	911	” Courtney ’s hand flies to her mouth , and her face turns ghastly pale . She reaches out , and I want to hug her . Instead , her lawyer rises slowly , calmly . “
82229	82244	82245	82245	I	1454	” The prosecutor begins to speak , but the judge holds up her hand . “
82260	82297	82298	82298	She	911	” With the bang of a gavel , she stands and leaves the courtroom . We all collapse in our seats . I take a deep breath and sit forward , reaching for Courtney ’s arm . “
82311	82319	82320	82320	I	1454	” Worry lines my friend ’s eyes . “
82330	82494	82324	82324	I	1454	” Holding my smile steady , I say a prayer under my breath . My phone is set to silent because Daisy and my mom are blowing it up with texts wanting to know what ’s happening . We wait what feels like an eternity for the judge to return from reviewing Courtney ’s case . I wish I had included pictures of my cheek after Ozzy chased me into the ladies room , but if the police are anything to go on , it would n’t matter . I saw him of my own free will . He did n’t touch me . I fell . It ’s the same thing they ’re saying about Courtney . If she were so afraid of him , why would she willingly go with him to a coffee shop ? It ’s like none of these people have jobs or children . My heart jumps when the bailiff returns to the front of the courtroom . “
82498	82541	82324	82324	I	1454	” We stand like it ’s church , and Judge Wright gathers her black robe as she takes her seat inside the small booth . My breath is stuck in my lungs as I wait for her to tell us her decision . “
82594	82648	82649	82649	I	1454	” My throat is tight , and I feel the bile rising in my stomach . How can she say this ? Did n’t she even see the restraining orders ? The pictures I took ? He was completely unpredictable . The black - robed woman continues , her tone actually sounding bored . “
82686	82687	82679	82679	she	234	” “
82695	82704	82679	82679	she	234	” Courtney ’s lawyer is on her feet . “
82716	82717	82705	82706	Miss Shaw	911	” “
82734	82739	82740	82740	She	911	” The judge snaps . “
82780	82781	82760	82760	She	911	” “
82828	82829	82812	82812	She	911	” “
82842	82850	82832	82833	a man	272	” The judge does n’t even hesitate . “
82883	82911	82912	82912	Your	1348	” The wooden doors at the back of the courtroom fly open , and a male voice I know well echoes through the near - empty room . “
82934	82994	82995	82995	I	1454	” Spencer strides up the aisle dressed as always in an expensive suit , but he ’s disheveled , his hair ’s a gorgeous mess , and he ’s not wearing a tie … And I hate how fast my heart beats at the sight of him . I hate that I ’m so stupidly happy to see him . “
82998	83006	83007	83007	Your	1348	” The prosecutor is on her feet . “
83027	83045	83007	83007	Your	1348	” The judge frowns at Spencer , and he motions to Courtney ’s lawyer to join him . “
83069	83094	83057	83057	I	1454	” All of the lawyers congregate around the judge ’s desk , and Spencer slides several sheets of paper from a brown manila envelope . “
83123	83178	83110	83110	Bailiff	240	” She stands and leaves the courtroom with the envelope in her hands , and the guard passes out the copies to the lawyers . Spencer walks to the defense table , speaking urgently to the lead attorney . From where I ’m sitting , I only catch bits of what he ’s saying . “
83200	83232	83192	83192	He	1360	” His brow is lowered , and he ’s so focused . He ’s so damn gorgeous . Courtney stands , and he takes her hand , giving her a smile . “
83248	83289	83290	83290	Joselyn	177	” My friend grasps his hand , and her eyes are so hopeful . I ’m standing behind the rail watching with gratitude and pain aching in my chest . Hazel eyes flicker to mine , and his brow relaxes . “
83292	83305	83290	83290	Joselyn	177	” His voice is like warm butter , but the bailiff interrupts . “
83309	83348	83349	83349	I	1454	” We turn at once to see the judge again taking her seat , a grim expression on her face . My scalp tightens , and I ’m not sure how much more of this I can take . “
83406	83407	83395	83395	He	58	” “
83410	83429	83432	83432	God	93	” It ’s a sharp gasp from my friend , and I lower my head to my hands . “
83434	83453	83432	83432	God	93	” The words slip from my lips , and a sharp bang comes from the podium in front . “
83459	83464	83432	83432	God	93	” The judge snaps . “
83513	83606	83607	83607	He	634	” The gavel bangs , and the bailiff tells us all to stand again , which we do . I feel outside my body , like I ’m not sure what just happened . It ’s all over . Just like that . The lawyers shake hands , and tears stream down Courtney ’s cheeks as Spencer pulls her into a hug . I step side to side trying to figure out how to get around the silly wooden railing between us when she turns and catches me in a big hug . “
83611	83619	83620	83620	He	634	” Her body trembles in my arms . “
83631	83724	83620	83620	He	634	” A knot is in my throat , and I blink back tears as I meet his eyes over her shoulder . His head is bowed slightly and his jaw is tight . He ’s not smiling — he watches us with detached satisfaction . It ’s so like him to do something this monumental and then to resist being proud or even to show emotion . One of the lawyers taps his shoulder , and they shake hands . Courtney lifts her head and speaks to the woman leading the team . “
83738	83739	83730	83730	I	1454	” “
83757	83758	83746	83747	Miss Shaw	911	” “
83762	83766	83746	83747	Miss Shaw	911	” Courtney nods . “
83775	83811	83812	83812	Joselyn	177	” I ’m holding her hand , and we start for the double doors at the back of the room . They ’re just closing behind us when a strong hand grasps my upper arm . “
83820	83852	83853	83853	I	1454	” Spencer ’s hand slides down my arm , and Courtney ’s dark eyes meet mine . I do n’t know what she sees , but she pulls out her phone . “
83867	83934	83935	83935	Your	1370	” My heart is lodged in my throat , and I ’m not sure I can have a proper conversation with him right now . At least not the one I need to have with him after this week . Still , it seems I have no choice . He guides me to the side hall , away from the crowd of attorneys leaving the courtroom . “
83949	83960	83935	83935	Your	1370	” He gazes into my eyes with so much intensity . “
83982	83995	83996	83996	You	1370	” My lips part , and I almost ca n’t believe him . “
84003	84004	83996	83996	You	1370	” “
84009	84050	84006	84006	I	1454	” He literally seems confused , and I close my eyes as my heart screams , Yes , you should have . We ’re in a relationship , dammit ! But my brain reminds me he never said we were … “
84081	84082	84065	84065	Courtney	414	” “
84099	84129	84065	84065	Courtney	414	” He gives me a sexy little half - smile , and I ca n’t hold back . My voice is sharp , and fire burns in my chest . “
84170	84234	84236	84236	I	1454	“ I love you . I want to give you what they never did . I want to be there for you , to make you laugh and bring you in from the cold . I want to show you a different life , one where you have someone to count on , someone who ’s always there for you no matter what . “
84295	84324	84325	84325	I	1454	” Turning on my heel , I leave him standing there , watching me go , and in my mind , the last petal falls . Chapter 30 Spencer “
84338	84353	84325	84325	I	1454	” Tom strides into the living room with a black duffel in his hand . “
84374	84375	84379	84379	Tom	769	” “
84381	84483	84379	84379	Tom	769	” My voice is quiet . I ’m sitting in my favorite wingback chair . It ’s thick brown leather with heavy brass studs along the edges . I found it in Boston at an estate sale where the seller claimed it once belonged to John Quincy Adams . It was my prized possession . Gazing at the hand - knotted Persian rug covering the floor , regret tightens my chest . I ’m just like him . Alone , in an empty house with only my things . Why does this bother me ? I never minded being alone before . “
84486	84497	84379	84379	Tom	769	” Tom waits , and I glance up at him . “
84500	84501	84379	84379	Tom	769	” “
84553	84565	84566	84566	I	1454	” My brow relaxes , and I exhale with a smile . “
84572	84573	84574	84574	You	1377	” “
84617	84630	84639	84640	Miss Shaw	911	” Leaning back in the chair , I hold up my hands . “
84642	84650	84639	84640	Miss Shaw	911	” He surprises me with a grin . “
84664	84682	84685	84685	Tom	769	” He ’s said more just now than in the whole time he ’s been with us . “
84687	84688	84685	84685	Tom	769	” “
84716	84778	84779	84779	Tom	769	” Her words are still ringing in my ears , her goodbye smarting in my chest . I have n’t been able to shake a sense of dread since she left me standing in the gallery of the court . Looking up at my suddenly gregarious security guard , I figure he ’s as good as anyone to run this past . “
84792	84793	84795	84795	sir	769	” “
84800	84801	84795	84795	sir	769	” “
84825	84837	84838	84838	I	1454	” His brow furrows , and he actually thinks a minute . “
84900	84915	84916	84916	I	1454	” Hesitating , I guess that is a type of good - deed backfire . “
84936	84937	84929	84929	I	1454	” “
84955	84970	84948	84948	She	1385	” I blink up at him , realizing he was with them every day . “
84976	84977	84978	84978	She	1385	” “
84984	84998	84999	84999	She	1385	” He points two fingers at his eyes then turns them on me . “
85010	85018	85023	85023	her	1385	” The gesture makes me chuckle sardonically . “
85025	85026	85027	85027	You	769	” “
85031	85044	85027	85027	You	769	” He makes a face like I just stepped in dog shit . “
85060	85077	85056	85058	Exorcising old demons	1386	” He inhales loudly and sits on the couch across from me , with a gesture . “
85082	85083	85079	85079	you	769	” “
85092	85098	85099	85099	You	769	” He might as well . “
85127	85128	85114	85114	I	1454	” “
85131	85174	85175	85175	Women	353	” I ’m pretty sure I have n’t done the right thing since a witchy redhead fell on me … however long ago it was . It feels like a short time ago , yet it also feels like my whole life . “
85240	85241	85226	85226	she	1390	” “
85245	85288	85226	85226	she	1390	” I think about all the things we ’ve discussed … I ’m not the beast or a prince or Mr. Freeze , despite what everyone likes to say . He stands and walks to where I ’m sitting lost in thought . “
85299	85307	85226	85226	she	1390	” He pats me on the shoulder . “
85333	85337	85338	85338	He	1392	” Chapter 31 Joselyn “
85347	85540	85541	85541	He	1393	” My mom leans on her kitchen table clutching her coffee mug of whiskey . Courtney and I stopped off at the Westin to collect our things and check out before driving to Fireside . She decided to wait on telling Ollie about his dad until after meeting with her therapist . Again , something Spencer arranged . It ’s like he thought of everything but me . Courtney cried silently most of the drive , and I held her hand . I ca n’t imagine how she ’s feeling , although she claims to be relieved . Still , when she and Ollie were finally together , they hugged like it had been months . We had a good old - fashioned dinner of fried pork chops , mashed potatoes and gravy , and corn and black bean maque choux , which happens to be my mom ’s specialty . Then my friend said she was exhausted , which was completely understandable . The two of them went upstairs for baths and bed , and I hung back to fill in all the details — or as many as I know . “
85553	85574	85541	85541	He	1393	” I exhale heavily into my coffee mug of whiskey . It has Dolly Parton on the front and the phrase “
85579	85593	85541	85541	He	1393	” She rocks back in her chair , setting her mug , which reads “
85597	85602	85603	85603	I	1454	” on the table . “
85641	85642	85643	85643	He	1393	” “
85650	85659	85643	85643	He	1393	” I frown , taking another small sip . “
85706	85746	85687	85687	he	1393	” My mom looks down , and I feel like I know what she ’s about to say , and I close my eyes . She reads my face and stands instead , walking around to hug my shoulders . “
85784	85792	85777	85777	I	1454	” Shrugging , I stand as well . “
85820	85821	85814	85814	her	414	” “
85824	85837	85814	85814	her	414	” Ma pats my arms before pulling me into a brief hug . “
85860	85880	85857	85857	your	1397	” My eyebrow arches . I know what she ’s suggesting , and I do exactly as she says . “
85885	85902	85857	85857	your	1397	” Ms. Alice clasps her hands as I carry the big Fireside Ladies Club book downstairs . “
85922	85944	85910	85910	I	1454	” She helps me carry it to the table , and Ma joins her bestie as they flip through the pages . “
85953	85967	85910	85910	I	1454	” Daisy elbows me in the ribs , obviously pretending to be surprised . “
85976	85988	85910	85910	I	1454	” I pinch the skin inside her arm and she squeals . “
85996	86017	85910	85910	I	1454	” She slaps my hand , and Courtney wanders in with a mug of coffee to blow my cover completely . “
86033	86045	85910	85910	I	1454	” Ms. Alice squints one eye and looks up at me . “
86049	86060	85910	85910	I	1454	” Courtney leans in closer , looking at the book . “
86074	86075	86066	86066	He	1402	” “
86078	86090	86066	86066	He	1402	” Ma steps back inspecting my face with a horrified expression . “
86100	86101	86102	86102	I	1454	” “
86112	86121	86106	86106	Ma	64	” I glare at Courtney to shut up . “
86138	86145	86136	86136	we	1401	” Ms. Alice waves us away . “
86177	86178	86180	86180	you	1397	” “
86182	86190	86191	86191	You	1397	” Courtney squeezes my mom ’s bestie . “
86215	86231	86213	86213	Ollie	374	” Her voice cracks , and my mom puts her arms around her as well . “
86252	86265	86268	86268	her	1397	” I shudder , putting my arms around the three of them . “
86273	86281	86268	86268	her	1397	” Courtney laughs , dabbing her eyes . “
86291	86298	86287	86287	He	276	” Daisy scoots into the group . “
86303	86304	86305	86305	He	276	” “
86310	86326	86327	86327	He	276	” Courtney shakes her head , taking the fresh cup of coffee from my mom . “
86339	86340	86327	86327	He	276	” “
86351	86382	86345	86345	he	276	” Daisy looks from her to me , and we quickly fill her in on his last - minute save in the courtroom . My cousin cuts me a grin . “
86399	86417	86385	86385	he	276	” Heat rises in my stomach , but it ’s silly heat . Silly , wasted heat . “
86429	86448	86449	86449	I	1454	” I shake my head , but Daisy ’s hand goes to her mouth as her eyes widen . “
86455	86467	86449	86449	I	1454	” Spencer ’s deep voice makes me almost spill my coffee . “
86480	86526	86473	86473	I	1454	” I turn around quickly to see him standing inside the door , stunning as always in a tan blazer over a black shirt . His hair is messy like he has n’t slept , and he looks like he stepped out of a magazine . “
86535	86552	86553	86553	Spencer	276	” Ms. Alice fans herself , and Ma hurries around grabbing a fresh mug of coffee . “
86573	86574	86569	86569	Alice	251	” “
86582	86611	86575	86575	You	276	” Ms. Alice holds out the platter . His eyes are leveled on mine when he answers my mom , and that silly wasted heat floods my face . “
86629	86630	86625	86625	she	136	” “
86639	86670	86637	86637	Spence	104	” Daisy pipes up from her spot at the table , but he does n’t look away from me . I know because I have n’t looked away from him . “
86681	86700	86701	86701	I	1454	” He steps closer , lowering his voice . Swallowing the knot in my throat , I shrug . “
86707	86735	86701	86701	I	1454	” I do not take his hand . Lifting my chin , I brush past him towards the front door , and Ms. Alice calls after me , “
86742	86846	86847	86847	I	1454	” I roll my eyes , shaking my head as I push through the door . My insides are hot and zippy , but I ’m not letting him get the best of me . I ’m not going back to the way things were before . He does a little jog to catch up with me , and for a minute we walk in silence . I follow the sidewalk outside Ma ’s new house , which is several blocks from the house where I grew up . Eventually , we meet up with the path leading to the small wooden bridge . “
86856	86863	86847	86847	I	1454	” Spencer finally breaks the silence . “
86876	86934	86847	86847	I	1454	” When we get to the bridge , I stop in the middle . I ’m not taking him all the way down the path into the alcove where the palmettos grow in thick clusters . My stomach is tight , and as much as I want to take him to that place , I ’m not . “
86940	87025	86847	86847	I	1454	” I turn to face him , leaning my hip against the railing . My arms are crossed so I do n’t do anything foolish like reach out and touch him . He puts a hand on the railing beside me , positioning his body so it ’s in front of me . The wind blows his hair forward attractively around his temples , and his clean scent of leather and sandalwood touches my nose . I blink away to keep from being distracted . “
87033	87034	87031	87031	Spencer	276	” “
87048	87068	87037	87037	I	1454	” He looks out over the water , and I watch the line of muscle move in his jaw . “
87077	87119	87069	87069	I	1454	” Shifting my stance , I wait . I said all I had to say to him in the courtroom , and now the ball is in his court . He blinks back to me , and his eyes are tight . “
87137	87150	87151	87151	You	276	” His words squeeze my chest , but it ’s not enough . “
87156	87157	87158	87158	I	1454	” “
87188	87201	87202	87202	I	1454	” As he speaks , his gaze falls to the water again . “
87215	87262	87202	87202	I	1454	” He hesitates , sliding a hand to his hip , moving his jacket back , like he ’s a model or something . My heart thumps in my chest , but I wo n’t help him with this . Clearing his throat , he straightens . “
87294	87301	87287	87287	I	1454	” Hazel eyes lock on mine . “
87309	87336	87302	87302	I	1454	” I blink , and a tear hits my cheek . His brow furrows , and he steps forward quickly to wipe it with his thumb . “
87346	87347	87302	87302	I	1454	” “
87351	87391	87392	87392	You	276	” I hiccup , covering my mouth with my hand . My chest is twisting with heat and love , and I ’m trying to be firm and push back on all the emotions he ’s stirring inside me . “
87399	87400	87392	87392	You	276	” “
87409	87424	87404	87404	I	1454	” His voice is hoarse , and he slides a hand in his pocket . “
87451	87452	87454	87454	you	276	” “
87456	87457	87454	87454	you	276	” “
87519	87553	87515	87515	I	1454	” When his eyes meet mine , they ’re more open than I ’ve ever seen him . He almost seems lost , like he ’s in a place he does n’t understand . “
87577	87623	87567	87570	the man you deserve	1414	” Shaking my head , I rush into his arms . My face is pressed into his chest , and he holds me close . I hear him inhale deeply at the side of my head , and my heart swells so fast it hurts . “
87630	87749	87567	87570	the man you deserve	1414	” My voice is a muffled whimper . His arms loosen , and he slides his hands up my arms , holding my shoulders before cupping my cheeks and covering my mouth with his . Fresh tears fall , and I grip his sleeves as our lips part , as his tongue sweeps in and curls with mine . Heat floods my lower body . It ’s a possessive kiss , demanding as always . He ’s claiming me , but I ’m claiming him right back . I pull him to me , wanting everything he ’s giving me . Lifting his chin , his face is relaxed . He ’s brighter as he exhales a chuckle . “
87757	87769	87770	87770	I	1454	” Reaching up , I slide my hand across his cheek . “
87779	87795	87770	87770	I	1454	” Looking down into my face , his pretty eyes are so full of emotion . “
87805	87880	87800	87800	You	1415	” Our lips collide once more , pulling and chasing , tasting and nipping . My body is on fire , and I want to rip his clothes off . Too bad , we ’re in the middle of Fireside , where everybody knows everybody . His lips move to the bridge of my nose . He kisses my forehead , then lifts my chin again , studying my face with so much love . “
87893	87894	87888	87888	I	1454	” “
87900	87901	87902	87902	I	1454	” “
87907	87947	87902	87902	I	1454	” He slides a hand in his pocket and takes out a ring . The band is black with diamonds arranged down the sides in an art deco style , and in the center is a polished jade stone . “
87955	87956	87957	87957	Daisy	446	” “
87964	87970	87957	87957	Daisy	446	” He almost seems worried . “
87992	88015	87986	87986	They	1416	” I take it at once and put it on the middle finger of my right hand tilting it side to side . “
88021	88029	87986	87986	They	1416	” He covers my hands with his . “
88038	88047	88048	88048	I	1454	” Blinking up at him , I smile . “
88052	88083	88084	88084	I	1454	” He lifts my hand to his lips , and his brow furrows . He blinks a few times , and fear tightens my throat until he meets my gaze . “
88088	88089	88090	88090	Spencer	276	” “
88092	88220	88221	88221	I	1454	” My voice breaks . Wrapping my arms around his neck , I close my eyes as he lifts me off my feet . We hold each other as it all surrounds us , from the first time he caught me when I fell to the day he saved me when I needed him most . So many times his actions said the words that are now promises . He ’s my beast , my frozen savior who rescued me , but who I also rescued from a lifetime of loneliness . He ’s the man of my dreams , the fierce , wounded prince saved by love . He ’s the kind of trouble I never want to be without . Chapter 32 Spencer Nine months later “
88231	88260	88221	88221	I	1454	” I ’m sitting in the kitchen of my future mother - in - law ’s home attempting to convince the most reluctant buyer I ’ve ever met . “
88264	88280	88221	88221	I	1454	” Alice spits the words in disgust , like I ’ve just kicked her dog . “
88304	88305	88309	88309	Alice	251	” “
88320	88331	88311	88311	I	1454	” I also happen to know Joselyn loves this book . “
88365	88382	88383	88383	You	1454	” Moving from my chair to sit beside her on the couch , I play dirty . “
88402	88416	88383	88383	You	1454	” Slipping my arm around her shoulders , I lean into her ear . “
88424	88436	88441	88441	Satan	244	” She does a little shiver before standing and rebuking me . “
88451	88463	88441	88441	Satan	244	” Leaning back , I cross my arms with a grin . “
88485	88498	88499	88499	You	244	” Her blue eyes fly wide and she throws up both hands . “
88504	88505	88499	88499	You	244	” “
88525	88552	88515	88515	I	1454	” I stand , speaking firmly , and she ’s so short , her gray helmet of hair only comes to the center of my chest . “
88573	88590	88563	88563	He	1425	” She waggles her eyebrows , but I ’m still doing my best to be stern . “
88596	88597	88563	88563	He	1425	” “
88604	88610	88563	88563	He	1425	” She crosses her heart . “

88635	88664	88665	88665	I	1454	” she shakes her head , waving me away . My jaw tightens , and I ’m about to steal the damn thing when she cuts me off . “
88694	88731	88683	88683	She	1427	” Lifting the heavy book , she puts it in my hands , and it ’s better than the best deal I ’ve ever closed . Except for getting Joselyn to take a chance on me . “
88740	88741	88738	88738	Alice	251	” “
88750	88762	88742	88742	You	244	” She winks , driving her pointy elbow into my ribs . “
88774	88809	88772	88772	son	1429	” It ’s no wonder Joselyn stole my heart . She ’s the same as this crazy town , the best kind of antique , the quirky kind that only gets better with age . “
88825	89013	88772	88772	son	1429	” Joselyn leans forward across from me at Rioz , and the slinky black dress she ’s wearing dips low on her cleavage . My eyes follow the line of thin , black silk with spaghetti straps over the soft curve of her full breast , and I want to forget dinner , take her home , and unwrap her like a present . It ’s been nine months since that day in Fireside , and I ’ve never been surer of anything in my life . Once we found Courtney and Oliver a safe , affordable place to live , I moved Joselyn back into my house . No surprise , Tom started dropping by to visit her friend pretty regularly , claiming he wanted to be sure they were safe . Now they ’re a couple , and Oliver is happy every time I see him — he bounces on his toes and talks too loudly . I ’m a fast learner . My biggest lesson , however , was I ca n’t live without this woman , and I ’ve got plans for tonight . “
89042	89100	89101	89101	I	1454	” We ’re sitting at the outdoor patio . It was a warm day , but with the sun down and the stars out , it ’s lovely . Our waiter Pat is cued up to hold dessert until I give him the signal . Her red lips curl in a naughty grin , and she winks . “
89115	89133	89101	89101	I	1454	” My cock twitches , and I have to focus my mind on the business at hand . “

89155	89171	89136	89136	your	1431	” She tilts her head to the side , placing her napkin on the table . “
89186	89187	89180	89180	I	1454	” “
89200	89218	89195	89195	You	1431	” She has to have dessert . That makes her laugh , and she shakes her head . “
89234	89266	89195	89195	You	1431	” I ’m about to say I ’ll buy a bigger house when her expression changes . She slides down in the seat making a face like she smelled something rotten . “
89271	89326	89331	89331	Sly	124	” I sit straighter , looking around the outdoor area , until my eyes land on a man I ’ve only seen once before . Still , I made a mental note when it happened . He has the nerve to walk right up to our table with a busty brunette on his arm . “
89338	89352	89331	89331	Sly	124	” My girl sits up straight at once , flashing a bold grin . “
89362	89377	89378	89378	Joselyn	177	” The woman on his arm wrinkles her nose when she tries to smile . “
89380	89418	89378	89378	Joselyn	177	” I do a quick take from her to Joselyn to the guy , and I quickly read the situation . He ’s being an ass , Joselyn is cringing , and this Nadine chick is threatened . “
89421	89429	89430	89430	I	1454	” I stand , extending a hand . “
89441	89458	89438	89439	Spencer Carrollton	621	” The idiot looks down at my hand like I ’ve offered him a dead fish . “
89466	89473	89460	89460	you	621	” It ’s not a question . “
89495	89512	89477	89477	she	1437	” My extended hand turns into a fist , which I quickly lower to my side . “
89539	89555	89556	89556	People	1534	” Nadine ’s jaw drops , but the idiot has the balls to get offended . “
89565	89566	89556	89556	People	1534	” “
89571	89580	89556	89556	People	1534	” I look down on this little man . “
89605	89628	89629	89629	You	621	” Joselyn ’s fingers fan over her full lips to hide her smile , and the bimbo jerks the idiot ’s arm . “
89642	89656	89657	89657	You	621	” She does a little sniff , and Elliot ’s face turns pink . “
89662	89686	89657	89657	You	621	” He sounds like a child on the playground . I might feel sorry for him if he had n’t insulted my girl . “
89715	89716	89717	89717	I	1454	” “
89721	89736	89717	89717	I	1454	” I quickly step forward , catching him by the front of his shirt . “
89751	89783	89717	89717	I	1454	” My voice is low , but the threat is real . I ’d like nothing better than to throw him on the ground and put my foot on his neck . “
89788	89800	89801	89801	I	1454	” He sputters , the red growing hotter in his face . “
89809	89810	89801	89801	I	1454	” “
89814	89827	89801	89801	I	1454	” My jaw is clenched , and I ’m actually growing excited . “
89832	89833	89834	89834	I	1454	” “
89838	89853	89834	89834	I	1454	” He yells , far louder than I expected . It ’s very satisfying . “
89862	89885	89886	89886	Joselyn	177	” It ’s more of an order than a question , and I steer him around so he ’s facing my date . “
89888	89923	89886	89886	Joselyn	177	” He ’s still shouting , and our fellow patrons stop eating . Two of the waiters rush out then stop when they see what ’s happening . I give him a sharp jerk . “
89926	89927	89928	89928	I	1454	” “
89941	89953	89932	89932	Joselyn	177	” He ’s breathing fast like the sniveling loser he is . “
89961	89962	89963	89963	I	1454	” “
89970	89981	89963	89963	I	1454	” Leaning forward , I look down into his face . “
90008	90048	89999	89999	I	1454	” I let him go with a shove , and he bounces off an empty table behind him before staggering to the exit . Looking around , I straighten my jacket , meeting a mixture of curiosity and approval . “
90061	90084	89999	89999	I	1454	” A light murmur and some laughter , and I look down at Joselyn , whose eyes are shining up at me . “
90094	90121	90086	90086	I	1454	” Pat stands at the door , and I do a little shrug . He waves me away with alternating thumbs up and fast air clapping . “
90125	90144	90086	90086	I	1454	” We barely make it through the door when Joselyn pins me to the wall with a kiss . “
90155	90206	90086	90086	I	1454	” I ’m right there , meeting her lips , grabbing her face , and turning her back to the wall so I can kiss her deeper . My hands slide up the slippery silk of the dress , lifting her breasts and teasing her nipples through the thin fabric . “
90214	90241	90086	90086	I	1454	” I trace a line with my lips along her jaw to her ear , inhaling deeply soft white flowers and the warmth of her body . “
90247	90315	90316	90316	Joselyn	177	” Sliding my hands down her hips , I cup her ass , but she holds my wrists , kissing my neck before dropping to her knees . Fuck , yes . Her hands are on my pants , sliding up and down as she gives me a naughty look , curling her fingers so her nails tease my thighs before rising higher to unfasten my pants . “
90318	90350	90353	90353	Jock	246	” I reach out to brace my hand on the wall , and she has my fly down . My cock springs free , and she wraps her fingers around it . “
90355	90363	90353	90353	Jock	246	” I ca n’t help a laugh . “
90370	90371	90353	90353	Jock	246	” “
90376	90397	90353	90353	Jock	246	” She leans forward to kiss the tip before flicking out her tongue and tracing it all around the edge . “
90403	90404	90353	90353	Jock	246	” “
90407	90457	90458	90458	You	246	” I groan , and she looks up at me with big blue eyes before pulling me all the way into her mouth on a long suck . My eyes roll shut as she does it again . Her mouth pops off , and she looks up at me . “
90464	90484	90458	90458	You	246	” Sliding my fingers along her cheek , I ’m still amazed by how much I feel for her . “
90493	90530	90485	90485	I	1454	” She grins , returning to my dick , tracing her tongue around it before pulling it between her red lips , smearing lipstick on my shaft , licking and sucking as her head bobs faster . “
90533	90629	90630	90630	You	1449	” I groan deeply . Both her hands slide up my legs , scratching her nails lightly over my ass . My eyes squeeze shut , and I do my best not to thrust forward and drive my cock down her throat . She ’s sucking and pumping me with her fist , making little hungry noises as she does it . She ’s on her knees , feasting like I ’m a fucking ice cream cone , and when I look down and see her breasts bouncing , I ca n’t take it anymore . “
90635	90639	90630	90630	You	1449	” I gasp . “
90644	90734	90735	90735	I	1454	” Reaching down , I catch her under the arms and pull her up , turning her stomach to the wall and ripping the silk over her ass . Fuck , I love this ass . I rip the thong off her just before I slam into her and hold . My heart is beating so hard , I ca n’t breathe , and she whines , bucking against my pelvis , sending me deeper into her clenching core . My teeth are tight , and I grind out , “
90741	90742	90743	90743	Me	1454	” “
90746	90898	90899	90899	You	1450	” she moans , twerking against me . Fumbling with the front of her dress , I find the top of her thighs and slip my fingers between them , massaging her clit fast as I thrust harder , faster . Her palms flatten against the wall , and she pushes against me , fucking me backwards as I do my best to wait for her . It ’s no use . I ’m too far gone as the ripples of orgasm climb my legs . My knees buckle , and I push up and hold , closing my eyes as I pulse into her so hard . My arms tighten around her waist , and I hold on so I do n’t fall as the planet shifts beneath my feet . Her hand fumbles over her shoulder into my hair , and I turn my face to kiss her neck . “
90906	90927	90928	90928	You	1450	” Her cheek rises , and I turn her to face me , looking down into her lazy blue eyes . “
90933	91022	90928	90928	You	1450	” For a moment , I take in her beauty . Her hair falls around her shoulders in messy , just - fucked waves , and her black silk dress is off one shoulder . Reaching down , I slide it up her arm . She leans closer , pressing her lips to my neck . My eyes close , and I want to carry her upstairs and repeat what we just did in my bed many times . Instead , I place my hands on her shoulders . “
91034	91045	90928	90928	You	1450	” She leans against the wall , smiling at me . “
91069	91070	90928	90928	You	1450	” “
91085	91086	90928	90928	You	1450	” “
91094	91095	90928	90928	You	1450	” “
91104	91205	91206	91207	My queen	1454	” Lowering to my knee , I pat the pocket of my jacket , locating the small item our waiter was going to bring out with the tiramisu . Her eyes widen , and she places her right hand over her heart — the same hand that holds my promise ring , which she never takes off . This item is more delicate . It ’s an 18 - karat , white gold diamond engagement ring with a three - karat oval diamond in the center and two baguettes on each side . In the band , I had the words “
91208	91211	91206	91207	My queen	1454	” engraved . “
91248	91274	91244	91244	you	1453	” She drops to her knees as I slide the ring on her left hand , nodding as she puts her arms around my neck . “
91287	91415	91416	91416	I	1454	” My eyes close , and I hold her tightly to my body , feeling the warmth of her , the beating of her heart , the fire in her soul . This woman , who brought so much trouble into my life … She broke me free from my prison . She melted the ice around my heart . She taught me to love — she taught me I could love . I ’ll never let her go . Lifting my head , I smooth my hands down the sides of her fiery red hair , gazing deep into her sparkling blue eyes . I kiss the freckles on her nose , so thankful she fell into my arms , my witchy angel , my queen . “
91420	91423	91416	91416	I	1454	” Epilogue Joselyn “
91432	91454	91455	91455	I	1454	” Spencer stalks across the parquet floors of the Oceanside Hotel ’s Grand Ballroom with a football helmet in his hand . “
91462	91574	91455	91455	I	1454	” I ’m at the top of a ladder threading the final flowers into a larger than life - sized sculpture of Belle and Prince Adam . It ’s a slight variation from the one I made for the ball in that Belle ’s hair is redder , and they ’re embracing closely rather than just dancing . It ’s my one contribution to the reception for our wedding , coming in only two days . Gazing down at him , holding that ridiculous helmet he got from Daisy , I wonder if I could love him more if he were n’t so over - protective . Short answer : No . “
91597	91624	91583	91583	I	1454	” I place the final coral rose in the side of Belle ’s hair then I sit back on the ladder , smiling at my creation . “
91633	91634	91583	91583	I	1454	” “
91655	91866	91870	91870	Ironman	248	” My nose wrinkles at my fussy fiancé , so sexy in an Armani suit . His dark hair is messy around his temples like he ’s been walking on the beach , and his hazel eyes are broody . That muscle in his perfectly square jaw moves like it does when he ’s annoyed with me . He still takes my breath away . It ’s been a year since he proposed , and I want to say a lot has changed . The truth is , we ’ve simply gotten to know each other better , and as a result , we ’ve grown deeper in love . Not everybody can say that . We ’ve also established a rule — neither of us can leave without a kiss goodbye . On Saturday , we ’ll be man and wife , and we ’re back to the beach with the whole gang turning out to celebrate with us . The noise of running footsteps precedes a little girl in a pink dress with a fluffy tulle skirt flying across the glossy dance floor . Her blonde hair bounces in curls around her chubby cheeks , and two little boys in matching black suits are hot on her heels . “
91872	91920	91870	91870	Ironman	248	” Melody yells just before passing a football to Spencer . He drops the helmet and catches it with a grunt a half - second before it nails him in the groin , and Daisy ’s daughter flies past him , steps ahead of Jesse and Ollie . “
91926	91939	91870	91870	Ironman	248	” Melody screams , now on the other side of the room . “
91946	91947	91870	91870	Ironman	248	” “
91958	91973	91870	91870	Ironman	248	” Ollie holds Spencer ’s arm , trying to get the ball from him . “
91981	92009	91979	91979	Ironman	248	” Melody ’s hands are over her head , and with every jump , her skirt rises and falls like a cloud . Spencer ’s brow lowers . “
92018	92030	91979	91979	Ironman	248	” Ollie makes a guilty face , and Jesse only laughs . “
92038	92039	91979	91979	Ironman	248	” “
92042	92095	92096	92096	He	1460	” Spencer grouses , and my lips press together to hold back a laugh as he tosses it underhanded just short of my little cousin . It bangs the ground on a corner and flies wildly in the opposite direction , and Melody jams her hands on her hips stomping after it . “
92109	92165	92103	92103	he	1460	” Jesse and Oliver take off after it , and she breaks into a run just beating them , scooping the ball into her arms , looking so much like her daddy , and heading across the dance floor in the direction they came . Spencer looks up at me and holds out his hand . “
92172	92204	92205	92205	You	1462	” Exhaling a happy sigh , I step down the ladder , dropping lightly into his arms . My arms go around his neck , and his go around my waist . “
92215	92223	92212	92213	Miss Winthrop	108	” His tone makes my insides clench . “
92229	92240	92212	92213	Miss Winthrop	108	” Leaning closer , I kiss his perfectly straight nose . “
92251	92270	92271	92271	Sly	124	” His eyes flare , and I start to laugh when my cousin slams through the double doors . “
92288	92316	92320	92320	them	1464	” We look over to my cousin , who is n’t paying attention to us . Her eyes are lifted to the floral statues I just finished . “
92322	92355	92320	92320	them	1464	” She whips out her phone and takes a picture while I ’m still in Spencer ’s arms . He lowers me to my feet , hugging my back to his chest . “
92362	92378	92359	92360	a genius	1465	” He kisses the side of my neck , and Daisy watches him , smiling . “
92401	92402	92403	92404	Your cousin	1529	” “
92409	92422	92423	92423	Melody	236	” he whispers in my ear , sending chills down my shoulder . “
92447	92448	92439	92439	They	1467	” “
92479	92492	92493	92493	I	1454	” Tilting my head to the side , I exhale a sigh . “
92501	92516	92493	92493	I	1454	” He slides a hand down to my ass , giving it a squeeze . “
92524	92543	92544	92544	You	1465	” Warmth floods my chest , and I place my palms on his jaw before kissing his lips . “
92548	92570	92544	92544	You	1465	” Tears are in my mom ’s eyes , and she attaches the small veil to the top of my braid . “
92580	92581	92571	92572	Your father	1829	” “
92584	92610	92611	92611	You	1465	” I cry , looking up at the ceiling and touching the tears away as soon as they form in the corners of my eyes . “
92619	92620	92611	92611	You	1465	” “
92635	92647	92648	92648	You	1465	” Daisy steps up to smooth my hair down my back . “
92661	92662	92648	92648	You	1465	” “
92679	92680	92673	92673	I	1454	” “
92693	92694	92681	92681	Spencer	621	” “
92700	92764	92681	92681	Spencer	621	” I wink , smoothing my hands down the thick white satin of my mini slip - dress . The front has a deep V - neck that shows off my cleavage , and the back is also plunging , held together by a delicate string tied in a bow . Daisy helps me into the white blazer I ’ll wear over it . “
92780	92797	92770	92770	I	1454	” The door to the dressing room suite opens , and Courtney sticks her head inside . “
92822	92823	92824	92824	They	593	” “
92831	92853	92824	92824	They	593	” Daisy fastens a necklace with a round blue sapphire charm resembling the night sky with three diamond stars on me . “
92872	92873	92862	92862	Scout	536	” “
92883	92895	92862	92862	Scout	536	” I lift the unique pendant and study the circular pattern . “
92898	92910	92912	92912	you	1465	” Her voice trails off suspiciously , and my eyes widen . “
92914	92936	92912	92912	you	1465	” Spinning around , I grip her wrists as she tries to act cool , which she totally sucks at doing . “
92941	92942	92912	92912	you	1465	” “
92957	92958	92959	92959	Daisy	446	” “
92961	92962	92959	92959	Daisy	446	” “
92970	92979	92963	92964	The natives	1475	” Ms. Alice barges into the dressing room . “
92994	93010	93011	93011	We	1474	” I give my cousin a tight hug , holding her hands before leaning back . “
93024	93031	93011	93011	We	1474	” Ma clutches my upper arms . “
93047	93359	93042	93042	You	1454	” JR escorts my mother to her seat , and Tom leads Courtney next . I ’m so happy to have him be a part of our lives now that they ’re dating . Scout appears to escort Daisy , and from where I ’m peeking behind the door , I catch his sparkling smile . He pulls her close and kisses her cheek , smoothing a hand over her stomach before starting for the front . I ’m so excited and happy for them , and looking around , I realize it ’s my turn . Sliding my hands down my skirt and adjusting my veil , I pick up the bouquet I arranged to match the sculptures . It ’s coral roses and oversized white peonies with thin white feathers cascading down the front . Walking myself down the aisle was my idea . I read it was a dramatic statement of independence and doing what I want … Now , I ’m wishing I had agreed to let Miles escort me . Even if he ’s shorter , it would be nice to have an arm to grip . I ’m a squinky bundle of nerves . The wedding march begins , and I clear my throat . I square my shoulders and head out to the crowd waiting beachside . Everyone stands when I appear , and my heart beats faster . I fix my gaze on Spencer and focus on putting one foot in front of the other . When he sees me , desire smolders in his eyes . It squeezes my stomach , and I wish I could kick off these shoes and run the rest of the way into his arms . As if sensing my anxiety , he leaves the front , meeting me halfway down the aisle and taking my hands . “
93372	93393	93042	93042	You	1454	” I blink fast to keep the tears away and clutch his arm , pulling my body securely against his . “
93399	93414	93415	93415	I	1454	” I lean in close , and he wraps an arm around my waist . “
93421	93556	93557	93557	I	1454	” We ’re at the front , and the minister begins with the traditional service . He leads us through the vows , and when he asks us to present the rings , Melody skips up in her tulle dress with Spencer ’s hammered titanium and ironwood band tied to a pillow . Heather found it at a vintage store in Boston and gave me a deal , something about our first child being named after her . Ollie has my ring in his pocket , a simple platinum band that connects with the beautiful diamond engagement ring he gave me a year ago . It ’s breathtaking and ridiculously expensive … but it ’s nothing compared to the steel jade ring I always wear on my right hand . Spencer ’s promise ring . “
93571	93675	93565	93565	You	1479	” Looking up into his eyes , my heart is so full , it hurts . This bossy , arrogant , wounded , wonderful man is exactly what I ’ve always wanted . He cups my cheeks in his large hands , and before giving me my wedding kiss , he looks all the way to my soul . Light shines in his smoky gaze , and I know he ’s thinking the same thing as me . We ’re back where we started , where he first caught me when I fell . I had no idea he would save me twice . “
93682	93786	93787	93787	I	1454	” he whispers , sliding his nose along mine before covering my mouth with his . It ’s a proper kiss , but it lights my body from the tips of my toes through my stomach all the way to my scalp . I clutch the front of his blazer , knowing I ’ll never let him go , and the noise of applause reminds me we have to stop kissing and be with our guests a little while . He lifts his head , looking into my eyes once more . I reach up to place my palm against his smiling cheek . “
