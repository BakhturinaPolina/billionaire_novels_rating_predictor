5934	5964	5928	5928	I	0	“ We ’re poised to be the leader in this field . Fletcher International will be synonymous with short - term commercial rentals , like Xerox is to copiers . ”

6101	6151	6152	6152	He	121	“ It ’s part of the reason we need to expand . Countries like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are looking for spaces in LA and New York . Once we have more properties on the books , they ’ll come pouring in . We find it , they come . ”
6178	6187	6188	6188	Stephen	123	“ You ’ve come pretty far pretty fast … ”
6203	6211	6188	6188	Stephen	123	“ But you ’re not there yet . ”
6230	6234	6235	6235	Hastings	123	“ Excuse me ? ”
6247	6283	6235	6235	Hastings	123	“ You need more big - ticket renters . Otherwise , we launch , and the US and European clients bypass us . They can do it themselves . Show me why they need this . ”
6306	6311	6312	6312	He	121	“ You ’re wrong . ”
6327	6380	6323	6323	He	121	“ We ’re already a concierge service . They do n’t want to bother with the real estate culture here , the security needs , the logistics . We have the experience and the contacts to make it seamless , and we offer only the best properties with top - notch security . ”
6381	6396	6397	6397	Stephen	123	“ I want to see bigger fish . Come back when you have them . ”
6425	6434	6416	6416	I	0	“ I wanted to work with you guys . ”
6442	6456	6435	6435	My	0	“ I hope we still need investors when you come to your senses . ”
6476	6512	6467	6467	Taron	121	“ Hang on , look guys , we get it . You want a sure thing . I ’ve got some leads out there now . How about we reconvene in a week or so ? ”
6527	6542	6521	6521	Remi	128	“ Sounds like a plan . Shoot me a message when you ’re ready . ”
6543	6551	6552	6552	Taron	121	“ You got it . Talk soon . ”
6585	6599	6600	6600	Taron	121	“ Fuck them . Braden Investments messaged me last week ready to go . ”
6615	6640	6641	6641	He	121	“ Braden wants a bigger piece of the profits , more control of which markets roll out and when . You will hate that . ”
6647	6654	6641	6641	He	121	“ So what are you saying ? ”
6655	6701	6702	6702	My	0	“ Give me a week . I ’m talking to Pro Partner and AmCham , both in Abu Dhabi and both interested . Raquel can help you with Madagascar , and I ’ll focus on securing them . Then I ’ll touch back with Remi . ”
6717	6730	6731	6731	I	0	“ One week , and we ’ll give them one last chance . ”
6750	6761	6762	6762	He	121	“ So why did you hire her of all people ? ”
6776	6785	6762	6762	He	121	“ She ’s good . We need her . ”
6786	6793	6762	6762	He	121	“ We do n’t need anybody . ”
6794	6816	6762	6762	He	121	“ We need Hastings and Key , and we need Raquel Morgan . She graduated at the top of her class . ”
6817	6828	6762	6762	He	121	“ There was n’t a man who spoke five languages ? ”
6829	6837	6762	6762	He	121	“ Have n’t you heard of diversity ? ”
6838	6847	6762	6762	He	121	“ An Arab man would ’ve been perfect . ”
6848	6851	6852	6852	He	121	“ Right . ”
6857	6880	6852	6852	He	121	“ That would go over great with our Nashville clients . They ’re still our biggest book of business , you know . ”
6881	6888	6762	6762	He	121	“ Remember when everybody spoke English ? ”
6889	6906	6762	6762	He	121	“ And the sun never set on the British Empire ? Yes , times have changed . ”
6920	6937	6762	6762	He	121	“ This is a small office . We work in close quarters . Women cause problems . ”
6938	6944	6966	6966	She	440	“ What are you saying ? ”
6945	6953	6966	6966	She	440	“ You should ’ve hired a man . ”
7002	7010	6996	6996	women	1709	“ Hope I ’m not interrupting anything . ”
7103	7108	7099	7099	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
7109	7123	7124	7124	She	346	“ Sandra said you needed this translation before the end of the day . ”
7137	7144	7124	7124	She	346	“ Is it on the server ? ”
7150	7173	7174	7174	She	346	“ Of course . I thought you ’d want to know it ’s ready now rather than having to find it later . ”
7333	7345	7346	7346	He	933	“ I guess I ’ll get back to unpacking my desk . ”
7352	7358	7346	7346	He	933	“ How ’s it going ? ”
7413	7418	7419	7419	I	0	“ Going pretty well . ”
7425	7435	7419	7419	I	0	“ Lucky break my first assignment was in French . ”
7436	7441	7442	7442	He	121	“ Is that lucky ? ”
7453	7460	7442	7442	He	121	“ I would ’ve been screwed . ”
7511	7530	7531	7531	He	121	“ I figured I ’d move these into the drawers in the same order you have them here . ”
7534	7571	7531	7531	He	121	“ Familiarize yourself with them , but you do n’t need to memorize . All the details are on the server . You can access it with your phone . Did Sandra get you set up ? ”
7572	7575	7576	7576	I	0	“ Yep . ”
7581	7587	7576	7576	I	0	“ I ’m all set . ”

7629	7637	7638	7638	He	121	“ I think you can handle it . ”
7651	7659	7638	7638	He	121	“ Thanks for giving me a chance . ”
7660	7665	7666	7666	He	121	“ You earned it . ”

7815	7821	7809	7809	I	0	“ Pretty busy , actually . ”
7887	7915	7875	7875	He	1815	“ On your first day ? That ca n’t be right . We usually give a few days ’ grace period before we work you to death . ”
7916	7942	7875	7875	He	1815	“ The boss did n’t get that memo . Patton assigned me a new client when I walked in the door . Skype meeting tomorrow . ”
7943	7946	7947	7947	He	1815	“ Madagascar . ”
7955	7969	7947	7947	He	1815	“ That should n’t be too hard for an international whiz like yourself . ”

9698	9726	9727	9727	He	470	“ It ’s on hold . Taron wants to follow up on some leads in the UAE , and Hastings wants to see if we land them . ”
9734	9757	9727	9727	He	470	“ When I ran things , we did n’t do business with the Arabs . Or the Chinese . Or the Russians . ”
9784	9797	9779	9779	I	0	“ Taron ’s smart . He would n’t deal with questionable firms . ”
9798	9819	9727	9727	He	470	“ If he knew about it . I ’d keep Fletcher all - American . You can always trust Americans . ”
9826	9838	9727	9727	He	470	“ It would n’t be Fletcher International if we did that . ”
9839	9863	9779	9779	I	0	“ You know , you do n’t have to do this launch . We ’re making plenty of money in the Nashville market . ”
9864	9892	9893	9893	He	470	“ We do have to do it , and you ’ll be glad once it ’s done and the value of your shares goes through the roof . ”
9924	9958	9911	9911	he	470	“ Bill said Martin was on one of those gossip shows today . They ’ve got pictures of him partying with Sissy Faith . On a Tuesday . Is he having issues again ? ”

10220	10223	10224	10224	I	0	“ Right . ”
10252	10271	10243	10243	He	470	“ It ’s after nine . You should n’t work late every night , you ’ll burn out . ”

10370	10382	10349	10349	I	0	“ Are you smoking in my office again ? Nasty habit . ”
10383	10396	10349	10349	I	0	“ Like anything could cut through thirty years of scotch and cigars . ”
10397	10412	10349	10349	I	0	“ Cigars bring out the character in the wood . Cigarettes are just dirty . ”
10413	10420	10421	10421	I	0	“ Was that all you needed ? ”
10431	10455	10421	10421	I	0	“ If you ’re dead set on this expansion , lock down Hastings and Key . They ’re good people . Good Americans . ”
10456	10459	10349	10349	I	0	“ Right . ”
10460	10477	10421	10421	I	0	“ And get a handle on Martin . You do n’t need another situation with him . ”
10490	10495	10496	10496	I	0	“ Night , Dad . ”
10593	10598	10584	10584	I	0	“ Who ’s there ? ”

10655	10672	10650	10650	he	358	“ Work starts at 9 a.m. , not 9 p.m. Where the fuck have you been ? ”
10673	10678	10679	10679	He	358	“ Is it nine ? ”

12127	12175	12122	12122	Her	496	“ They stay outside except the ones who ’ve been declawed . It ’s such a cruel practice , declawing . It ’s like cutting off the tips of all your fingers , and as they get older , they develop arthritis making it painful to jump — ”

14068	14084	14085	14085	He	933	“ Makes everything take twice as long as it should . An annoying power move . ”

15320	15364	15365	15365	God	112	“ Well , starting today , we ’re implementing a ten percent finder ’s fee on all new rentals , and the 24 - hour premium - level security you have here for free will be an additional fifteen hundred dollars a month . ”
15376	15397	15398	15398	Taylor	156	“ As it stands , you ’re set to save almost ten thousand dollars if we close the deal today . ”
15409	15427	15398	15398	Taylor	156	“ I have not heard any mention of premium - level security . It simply says security . ”
15428	15433	15437	15437	Rocky	119	“ Yes , well … ”
15439	15536	15537	15537	Patton	933	“ Based on client feedback , we ’ve decided to offer different levels of security . Our former service will become premium , with a security guard on site at all times and regular drive - by checks from local police . From there it will go all the way down to basic , which is just the drive - by without the on - site security guard . We ’ll customize it to meet clients ’ needs , but as your deal stands , you ’re getting the top of the line package for free . ”

15674	15719	15720	15720	He	933	“ I was telling them how we decided to waive it for them on this deal and provide our top of the line , 24 - hour security at the rate we ’ve already quoted . But only if we close the deal today . ”
15766	15769	15770	15770	He	933	“ Yes … ”
15780	15823	15770	15770	He	933	“ I did n’t think we needed to mention these changes , since you were ready to sign . But in case there ’s any hesitation , we do n’t want you to miss this opportunity . It ’s quite a deal . ”

16240	16259	16260	16260	Bastard	162	“ You ’ve been here less than two days . You ’re not ready to take the lead . ”

20057	20094	20052	20052	he	1815	“ Patton ? Who knows . His father rides him hard . He wants to make a name for himself on his own merit . He feels responsible for everything that happens . Pick a reason . ”
20103	20113	20095	20095	I	0	“ I suppose it ’s a lot of pressure … ”

20153	20165	20166	20166	He	1815	“ I graduated from Owen School of Business … at Vanderbilt ? ”
20169	20198	20166	20166	He	1815	“ Oh , right . Still , I could take you out , show you the town . It ’s a long weekend . What do you say ? ”

22268	22310	22262	22262	She	651	“ It was all very off the cuff , actually . I based it on the real - estate model . Realtors charge at least six percent on every sale . I thought , why are n’t we doing the same ? ”

22487	22560	22561	22561	Taron	121	“ Most office buildings have some level of security , and most police forces will send a cruiser to drive by after hours if requested . If they want a full - time guard , we could contract with retired officers or perhaps even military . And we could offer these services at a special rate — or even waive them to make a deal more attractive like we did with Madagascar . ”

He pushes me onto my tiptoes with every desperate thrust of his cock . He hits my G - spot again and again until … Oh , God , yes … The orgasm shoots through my stomach like a rocket , leaving sizzling streams of pleasure in its wake . I open my mouth and the noise of pleasure is so loud and low , I sound feral . Patton ’s fist grips in the side of my hair , and he turns my face so he can cover my mouth with his . He consumes me , pushing his cock harder , deeper into my grasping core . Our tongues curl , our mouths move , and our lips nip and pull as we try to keep up with each other . My knees are liquid , but I ca n’t fall . He ’s holding me in his strong hands . Three more hard thrusts , and his body stills . He holds himself deep inside me , and I feel the pulsing of his cock . His ragged groans are in my ear , and I close my eyes , loving that sound . Loving all of this from the fresh spring waters to the earthy scent of the cave around us . He wraps one arm around my waist and the other around the front of my shoulders , holding my back flush against his hard chest . I love the feel of his hot skin melding to mine . I reach up and hold his strong forearm , resting my head against his shoulder and closing my eyes . For several beats of our hearts , we stay that way — the deep feeling of union here under this cascade of water , washing over both of us . All I can think is if this is wrong , if he ’s the devil , then take me to hell . I ’ll go willingly . “

She was so sad when I told her my truth — that I ’ll never stop blaming myself for his condition — like it was her problem as well . Why would she think that ? She ’s doing something to me . From the way she looks at me , to the way she believes in me . I do n’t know why or how , but the block of ice in my chest that ’s been passing for a heart for years is starting to thaw . Leaning forward , I kiss her neck . “

60445	60455	60456	60456	I	0	” She ’s grinning like she won the lottery . “
60462	60495	60456	60456	I	0	” Stepping across the small space , she puts her arms around my waist . Her chin lifts , and she kisses the side of my jaw before whispering in my ear . “
60501	60734	60496	60496	I	0	” She kisses my neck , and it ’s a mini lightning strike . My hand slides in my pocket to make an adjustment , and the elevator dings . We separate at once . She moves to one side of the metal box , and I step to the other , inspecting my leather loafers as she exits ahead of me . Taron asked to meet in my office first thing to discuss our next steps , but all I can think about are my next steps with Rocky . She brought up her sister last night , and like a fucking coward , I was n’t ready to have that conversation . We ’ve got to have that conversation and soon . Especially now that my feelings are involved . How did this happen ? I open my door and go to my desk , lifting the cover of my laptop and sending a quick text . I ’m here . Ready when you are . Outside my window , the nonstop traffic pours around the city like a stream around rocks . The pedestrians are already blocking up Broadway , and the sun is making its way up a clear blue sky . I could use a cigarette . My hand goes in my pocket to the plastic pack of gum as a light tap sounds on my door . “
60737	60755	60496	60496	I	0	” Taron walks in and my brow furrows I do n’t like the look on his face . “
60760	60761	60762	60762	I	0	” “
60793	60794	60786	60787	A temp	1146	” “

60821	60828	60805	60805	Sandra	651	” But his expression is resigned . “
60833	60834	60805	60805	Sandra	651	” “
60837	60854	60805	60805	Sandra	651	” He takes a seat across from my desk , and I ’m not smiling now . “
60887	60888	60881	60881	I	0	” “
60891	60916	60881	60881	I	0	” I slip a white square of gum in my mouth and sit in my leather chair , crossing an ankle over my knee . “

60927	60958	60921	60921	Raquel	651	” He slides his palms down the front of his jeans , and I notice how casually he ’s dressed — jeans and a dark , V - neck tee . “
60993	60994	60984	60984	I	0	” “
61001	61012	61013	61013	I	0	” He lifts his head , green eyes meeting mine . “

61131	61145	61120	61120	You	1152	” He pushes to standing as well , meeting me eye to eye . “
61154	61188	61120	61120	You	1152	” Snatching a piece of paper out of my desk , I dispose of the fucking gum . Who came up with this concept anyway ? Chewing gum . Such a bovine activity . “
61215	61216	61207	61207	Sandra	651	” “
61224	61231	61207	61207	Sandra	651	” He walks to the window . “

61261	61274	61258	61259	The girl	312	” His eyes flash at me , but I lower my brow . “

61424	61461	61420	61420	I	0	” He picks up the photo of us again , like he always does in my office , as if holding it has the power to send us back in time , to right past wrongs . “

61513	61525	61526	61526	Sawyer	101	” He puts the photo down and goes to the door . “

61574	61575	61560	61560	You	121	” “
61594	61604	61585	61585	Jerry	1815	” He pauses at the door , looking down . “
61619	61673	61614	61614	I	0	” He ’s out the door , and I collapse into my chair . I want Taron to be happy . I do n’t want to force him to stay somewhere that makes him miserable . But damn , it feels like a kick in the gut for him to leave . 23 Raquel “
61677	61703	61704	61704	Patton	121	” Sandra is in my office , sitting on the corner of my desk and grinning like she had a hidden camera in Pigeon Forge . “
61718	61719	61704	61704	Patton	121	” “
61730	61740	61741	61741	He	121	” The very thought makes me want to laugh . “
61745	61750	61741	61741	He	121	” She leans forward . “
61753	61916	61741	61741	He	121	” I dig in the new banker ’s box I just inherited from Taron . He stopped in this morning to say it was his last day . I had a small panic attack , but he was strangely calm . He said I did such a great job communicating with Hastings & Key and supporting him last week with Abu Dhabi , he was passing all his files to me . He vaguely mentioned having something else lined up , but he did n’t elaborate . I did n’t feel right pressing for details . Long story short , I guess I ’m the new Taron in the office . The door to Patton ’s office opens , and my stomach tightens . My insides buzz in anticipation of seeing him again , but only Taron walks out . My shoulders fall , and I return again to the banker ’s box . Sandra laughs , looking from me to Taron . “
61921	61922	61923	61923	I	0	” “
61933	61994	61923	61923	I	0	” Shaking my head , I keep my eyes fixed on my work , even while my cheeks grow hotter . A light tap on the door draws my attention . Taron ’s there , and I ca n’t help thinking he ’s such a handsome man , I ’m sure he ’ll land on his feet wherever he goes . “
61999	62012	61923	61923	I	0	” He steps inside , and I stop what I ’m doing . “
62026	62027	62017	62017	I	0	” “
62063	62070	62073	62073	Patton	121	” He glances over his shoulder . “
62081	62090	62073	62073	Patton	121	” A relieved smile breaks across my face . “
62098	62109	62093	62093	I	0	” He pats my arm and heads for the door . “
62118	62124	62093	62093	I	0	” That seems generic enough . “
62131	62142	62093	62093	I	0	” Sandra hops off the desk and follows him out . “
62151	62278	62279	62279	Rocky	119	” They ’re gone , and I sink into my chair , my head spinning . I ca n’t imagine Patton is happy about Taron leaving , especially with Marley in such a fragile state . Still , Dubai is onboard . We ’re in a really great position for me to figure out my place here . Sandra has been on me like white on rice trying to figure out if Patton and I are more than just colleagues . I can not let her find out I slept with him … repeatedly — especially not now that I ’ve been promoted to Number 2 . If that ’s what I am . I ’m about to get back to work when my phone buzzes . “
62290	62382	62279	62279	Rocky	119	” My stomach jumps . Patton sounds pissed , but he called me Rocky … that has to be a good sign , right ? Picking up my phone , I walk down the short hall to his closed door , ignoring Sandra along the way . Knocking softly , I open the door and step inside , closing it behind me . Patton ’s in his chair with his back turned , looking out the window . He does n’t move , so I clear my throat , speaking quietly . “
62389	62425	62426	62426	You	1168	” I hear him exhale , and he puts his foot on the floor , turning to face me . His eyes are on the papers on his desk , and I notice something new . “
62431	62468	62426	62426	You	1168	” Disbelief is in my tone . For someone who despises all black , I ca n’t imagine chewing gum is acceptable behavior . Dark eyes cut up to me , and he is not smiling . “
62474	62491	62426	62426	You	1168	” I hold my expression steady even though my insides are doing a little happy dance . “
62496	62497	62426	62426	You	1168	” “
62501	62527	62426	62426	You	1168	” He holds out a cream card with black calligraphy engraved on it . I take it , quickly scanning the words of the invitation . “
62532	62533	62534	62535	Big investor	1169	” “
62563	62571	62555	62555	I	0	” Now my insides are really jumping . “

62604	62615	62576	62576	Jerry	1815	” I nod , studying the date … this Thursday . “

62682	62737	62665	62665	everyone	459	” Am I ? I think about this a moment . I think about Sandra ’s obsession with finding out what we ’re doing . I think about our weekend in Pigeon Forge , and my toes curl . We came so far . We shared so much . The answer is really easy . “
62751	62752	62744	62744	I	0	” “
62759	62772	62773	62773	I	0	” He lifts the cover of his laptop and starts to type . “
62781	62798	62773	62773	I	0	” The muscle in his jaw moves as he types , and I hesitate before speaking . “
62803	62811	62799	62799	I	0	” Confused eyes look up at me . “
62833	62842	62829	62829	I	0	” He blinks back to his computer screen . “
62852	62893	62843	62843	Taron	121	” I ’m sure he ’s more upset than he ’s showing , but I have to let him come to me in his own time . With a nod , I start for the door when he stops me . “
62902	62903	62843	62843	Taron	121	” “
62906	62920	62921	62921	Patton	121	” I look at him confused , my voice lowered to a whisper . “
62927	62928	62921	62921	Patton	121	” “
62933	62938	62921	62921	Patton	121	” He continues typing . “
62956	62979	62943	62943	We	1177	” My brow lowers , and his dark eyes cut up to me . A hint of a grin curls his lips . “
62988	62989	62990	62990	Patton	121	” “
63007	63008	62990	62990	Patton	121	” “

63067	63074	63059	63059	You	1175	” My voice is pure skepticism . “
63105	63144	63098	63099	The investor	1178	” Such a typical Patton response . I want to point out this is not what I consider sorting out our relationship . It feels like muddying the waters even more , but he picks up his phone . “
63172	63203	63204	63204	Jerry	1815	” When he puts it that way , it does sound like a business - only trip . Still , I know it ’s going to be more than that . “
63220	63241	63210	63210	Raquel	651	” I pause at the door , glancing back as he speaks . He puts his hand over the receiver . “
63263	63443	63255	63255	me	0	” He returns to the phone , and I step out into the hall . Looks like I ’m going to LA for a gala . I need to call Renée . Only I ’m a little scared of what she ’s going to say . I left her advice so far behind , I ca n’t even see it anymore . Just before I close the door , I glance back at his square jaw , his dark eyes focused on the computer screen , his hands quickly typing … I ’ve fallen for the devil , and there ’s no turning back now . I ’ve always heard Los Angeles is a big smoggy mess of traffic and fake people , but when we touch down at LAX on Wednesday evening , I could n’t be more excited . The sun is shining and the sky is clear and blue . We left Nashville at the same time as we arrive , which slightly messes with my head when we disembark after a three - hour flight . “
63447	63460	63461	63461	I	0	” I muse , but I do n’t feel tired at all . “
63470	63615	63461	63461	I	0	” Patton takes my hand , lacing our fingers . The minute we stepped on the plane , his demeanor changed . All week , he ’s been very professional in the office . Almost too professional considering how close we got in the mountains . Still , I ’ve been sleeping at my place and reporting for work like we ’re strictly coworkers . He ’s been following suit . Now it ’s like we ’re on another mini escape — even if he ’s calling it business . It ’s my first time in the city , and I ca n’t wait to walk around downtown and hopefully see some of the famous Los Angeles landmarks . Leaning into the window of our black Lincoln towncar , I look up at the skinny palm trees clustered in the breaks on the Interstate . “
63625	63645	63461	63461	I	0	” Patton is checking emails on his phone with one hand , my hand still clutched in his other . “

63664	63683	63684	63684	Jerry	1815	” I feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman … without the whole prostitute thing , of course . “
63699	63714	63692	63692	He	1815	” His voice goes down , and I think the same thing . Great . “
63724	63725	63692	63692	He	1815	” “
63730	63738	63692	63692	He	1815	” I jump around in my seat . “
63751	63752	63692	63692	He	1815	” “
63760	63767	63768	63768	I	0	” He chuckles at my enthusiasm . “

63780	63808	63809	63809	We	1189	” I was n’t able to focus on anything Monday . My head was still spinning from our weekend . Kind of like it is right now . “
63814	63820	63809	63809	We	1189	” His face turns thoughtful . “

63964	63980	63878	63878	I	0	” He ’s still holding my hand , and I ’m starting to get excited . “

64034	64054	64055	64055	We	1191	” I make a sad face , and he lifts our clasped hands , kissing the back of mine . “
64062	64080	64055	64055	We	1191	” My breath catches at his words . Have we reached the point of making future plans ? “
64083	64092	64055	64055	We	1191	” The word comes out on a breath . “
64118	64291	64292	64292	They	1198	” Oh , right . Duh , Rocky . Cool your over - active imagination . He looks out the window , and I feel like a naive little girl . This actually is a business trip . We have clients here we need to meet with and solidify our relationships . This is n’t a sex trip to LA as he so delicately put it back at the office . The car pulls up in front of the Ritz Carlton , passing the Grammy Museum and the Staples Center on the way , which I excitedly point out . I step out , looking all the way up to the sky before Patton drags me through the doors into an expansive , beige - stone lobby . It ’s bright and open , and elegantly dressed couples mix with couples wearing long shorts and too - tight tees with flip flops walking from the bar to the elevators . I wait by the complimentary cucumber water while Patton checks us in . “
64299	64351	64292	64292	They	1198	” He takes my hand and leads me to the gleaming elevators . I ’m still looking all around like I ’ve never been in a nice hotel before . Actually , I ’m hoping to have a celebrity sighting . Patton leans toward my ear as if reading my mind . “
64359	64360	64292	64292	They	1198	” “
64367	64368	64292	64292	They	1198	” “
64372	64468	64292	64292	They	1198	” The elevator dings and we step inside with a few other couples . They ’re not celebrities , and I feel Patton ’s eyes on me . Glancing to the side , he ’s got a mischievous grin on his face . It makes my stomach feel tight . I ’m instantly thinking about our moment in an elevator not too long ago and wishing we were alone . That man has the most talented tongue … Eventually , it ’s just the two of us going higher , and I study the panel . “
64475	64476	64472	64472	we	1199	” “
64490	64498	64499	64499	You	1202	” He hands me a plastic card . “
64510	64515	64499	64499	You	1202	” My chest squeezes . “
64526	64527	64528	64528	She	651	” “
64543	64594	64595	64595	I	0	” A soft tone sounds , and the elevator stops , opening to a small foyer area with four large , brown doors spaced out and leading to individual suites . Patton exits the elevator , and I follow him slowly , trying to decide how I feel about this . “
64606	64624	64595	64595	I	0	” He swipes the door open , and holds it , looking back with that same grin . “
64634	64674	64595	64595	I	0	” Marching across the short space , I ’m planning out my comeback when my breath is stolen by two walls of windows with a view of the whole city and the San Gabriel Mountains hazy in the distance . “
64677	64706	64595	64595	I	0	” It ’s a breathless sigh as I walk across the dark wood floors covered in beige carpets to kneel on the sofa in front of the window . “
64711	64738	64595	64595	I	0	” The door closes , and I hear Patton chuckle as he goes to the kitchen and takes two bottles of San Pellegrino from the fridge . “
64749	64760	64739	64739	I	0	” Cracking one open , he hands it to me . “
64775	64776	64777	64777	You	1202	” “
64781	64795	64777	64777	You	1202	” I cut my eyes at him , unable to hide my smile . “
64807	64808	64804	64804	I	0	” “
64818	65011	65012	65012	I	0	” He takes a sip of his water , going to the door . I ’m unable to move from my spot looking down at all the houses and buildings . To my left are more high - rise buildings , but we seem to be on the edge of them . We have an unobstructed view of the scenery . Looking over my shoulder , Patton tips the bellman and rolls our luggage down the narrow hall to what I assume is the bedroom . The suite is long and narrow with matching beige furniture , brown wood tables and soft leather chairs . The bedroom is behind a wall with entrances on both sides . I climb off the sofa and go to where he ’s hanging his suit and tux . The wall of windows extends the length of the hall into the bedroom , which is gorgeous . It ’s decorated in soothing shades of sand and cream , and the bed looks like it ’s floating over a rectangular base . A thick white duvet is on top with a soft , knit blanket in the center . “
65019	65049	65012	65012	I	0	” He turns and catches my hand , leading me past another wall to an enormous bathroom with a stone - lined jetted tub near the window - wall . “
65058	65070	65071	65071	I	0	” A little thrill zips through my stomach at his words . “
65079	65080	65071	65071	I	0	” “

65109	65126	65097	65097	I	0	” He catches my hand , leading me back down the hardwood hall to the entrance . “
65135	65254	65097	65097	I	0	” We hop in the car , holding hands as usual . It ’s almost like we ’re afraid to let go , lest one of us slips away . Five minutes later , he ’s helping me out in front of a large square with a brown sign reading Grand Central Market . It ’s crowded with pedestrians , but it seems we ’re a bit ahead of the regular dinner rush . He leads me to a white - tiled counter with Wexler ’s Deli painted on the front . We wait in line , and I scan the menu . It ’s typical New York deli fare . The woman at the register smiles expectantly . “
65262	65299	65097	65097	I	0	” As far as I can tell , Patton never even looked at the menu . She rings it up , and he hands over the money . It ’s like I ’m not even here . “
65306	65339	65097	65097	I	0	” He passes me a paper cup , and two guys behind the glass barrier get busy slinging rye bread , pastrami , swiss cheese , Russian dressing , and cole slaw . “
65349	65359	65097	65097	I	0	” He takes his change and takes a pause . “
65380	65411	65369	65369	Langer	227	” They ’re done , handing us a white paper bag , and he leads me to a table . I ’m sipping my drink thoughtfully as I watch him . “
65421	65435	65414	65414	you	1211	” We unwrap our sandwiches , and I confess , it smells delicious . “
65443	65444	65414	65414	you	1211	” “
65473	65474	65505	65505	my	0	” “
65478	65503	65505	65505	my	0	” I take a bite , considering how much additional homework I need to do when the smoky , tangy flavors hit my tongue . “
65507	65516	65505	65505	my	0	” I sit back , covering my mouth . “
65531	65532	65526	65526	I	0	” “
65541	65577	65526	65526	I	0	” I ’m amazed and a lot thrilled that he pays so much attention to my interests . We chew quietly for several minutes . As usual , he ’s nearly finished in five bites . “
65589	65599	65578	65578	You	1211	” He seems confused at first , then nods . “
65602	65603	65578	65578	You	1211	” “
65616	65617	65604	65604	You	1211	” “
65621	65657	65604	65604	You	1211	” I finish half my sandwich and wrap up the other , putting it in the bag . My stomach is tight and my heart is beating so fast , I ’m not really hungry . “
65670	65671	65664	65664	I	0	” “
65683	65698	65664	65664	I	0	” He leads me out , and we stroll down Broadway a little ways . “
65717	65797	65664	65664	I	0	” A park is on our right with paved steps and trees clustered around a fountain . A wall of art is in the middle , leading out to a pool of water . We walk a few more blocks , and I notice the sky is growing dim . The sun is setting here , but to my body clock , it went down hours ago . I ca n’t help a yawn , and Patton sees it . “
65800	65814	65815	65815	We	1218	” He reaches out , hailing a cab , and we hop in . “
65833	65852	65815	65815	We	1218	” The thought of returning to the hotel with him tightens my stomach , waking me up again . “
65856	65859	65815	65815	We	1218	” 24 Patton “
65865	65947	65815	65815	We	1218	” I watch as Rocky walks ahead of me into the softly lit suite . The sun is just setting over the mountains and the lights of the city are blinking on . Being here with her is like seeing it all again for the first time , and I want to lay her on the bed and be inside her . Instead , I go to the kitchen , open the fridge , and uncork a bottle of Mumm Napa . “
65960	66227	65952	65952	I	0	” Blue eyes flicker to mine , and she smiles in a way that stokes my anticipation . Holding the wine and two flutes , and I pause at the control panel to turn on the music . Soft singing fills the air , but it ’s not too distracting . I want to focus on her , my little fighter . She always wants to argue with me , but I appreciate when she lets me win . Like , for instance , with our accommodations . Of course , who could resist this view ? I put the wine on the beige counter holding a large , flatscreen TV and remove my blazer . I hang it in the closet and toe off my shoes . Reaching in my pocket , I take out a condom and place it on the bedside table , then I grab the wine , ready to find my girl . I do n’t even pause to reflect on me … Patton Fletcher thinking those words . I ’m too distracted by the trail of clothes leading to the bathroom . A pink sweater followed by a lacy pink bra has my blood heating . Dark jeans and a black thong have me setting the wine on the vanity and pulling my dress shirt out of my slacks . The low hum of the jets fills the air , and I see her fully immersed with her hair tied up in a bun on top of her head . Her body is obscured in the water by white foam . “
66233	66245	66228	66228	They	1221	” Her eyes are full of delight , then she laughs . “
66256	66257	66258	66258	I	0	” “
66267	66279	66258	66258	I	0	” Getting closer , it ’s the earthy smell of lavender . “
66287	66369	66280	66280	I	0	” Her lips press together and she shakes her head . I pour two flutes of wine and hand one to her . She takes a sip , her eyes fixed on me as I unbutton my shirt halfway and pull it over my head . As usual her eyes heat , and desire is plain on her face . It raises my semi to full hard - on . My pants drop , and her lip goes between her teeth . “
66375	66402	66403	66403	I	0	” I ca n’t resist teasing her . She blinks quickly , tearing her eyes away from my cock and tilting her head toward the window . “
66417	66418	66413	66413	You	1222	” “
66426	66442	66444	66444	I	0	” Stepping into the warm , swirling water , I clink my glass against hers . “
66449	66461	66444	66444	I	0	” Her nose scrunches adorably , and she takes a sip . “
66471	66493	66466	66466	You	1222	” I take a sip and set my flute aside , setting hers aside as well and reaching for her waist . “
66496	66562	66466	66466	You	1222	” She ’s on my lap in a straddle , and our lips meet , parting as our tongues slide along each other ’s . Her hand goes below the water , fingers wrapping around my cock and slowly moving up and down . It makes me groan , and I do n’t want to stop . I want to slide right inside her now . “
66577	66612	66613	66613	I	0	” I ’m tired of having to break for condoms . She ’s on my lap , her lips right at my ear , kissing my skin and making it harder to resist her . “
66619	66620	66621	66621	I	0	” “
66626	66647	66621	66621	I	0	” It ’s been so long , I barely remember the last time . Her voice is a sultry purr . “
66654	66710	66648	66648	I	0	” We ’ve only just gotten in the tub , but she stands and grabs one of the plush robes off the hook on the wall . She taps the button to turn off the jets and carefully steps out , pulling the soft terrycloth over her shoulders and holding out a hand to me . “
66714	66833	66834	66834	Rocky	119	” She does n’t have to ask twice . I stand , taking the other robe and pulling it over my body . It absorbs the water from our skin , and I take her hand as she walks me to the California king - sized bed . It ’s lit on all sides with small yellow lights , and track lighting illuminates the floor around it , making it seem to float . We step onto the fluffy beige carpet and she turns , dropping to her knees . I ’m just about to speak when her hands slide up my thighs , grazing my balls with her nails and guiding my aching erection to her lips . “
66836	67034	66834	66834	Rocky	119	” My large hands catch the sides of her head , and she pulls my tip between her pillow lips . Round , blue eyes gaze up at me , and she flickers her tongue all around , sucking as she slides her hand up my shaft to meet her mouth . I groan loudly as she takes me farther down her throat . It feels incredible . My knees are weak , and I ca n’t stop watching her moving faster , taking me deeper . I ’m about to shoot down her throat when I reach down to lift her by the arms , moving her onto her stomach on the bed . Snatching the condom off the night stand , my fingers shake , I ’m so close . I roll it on quickly then step to her , ripping the robe up and exposing her creamy , heart - shaped ass . Yes , I want that . Grabbing her hip , I pull her to the edge . I ’m lost in a haze of need as I line up my tip and shove balls deep into her clenching , wet pussy . “
67039	67529	66834	66834	Rocky	119	” It ’s a low , guttural groan , and I thrust faster . She moans , lifting her hips up to meet me , chasing her own orgasm . I ’m too far gone to help . I ’ll make it up to her in just a few … more … Jesus … I come so hard on my last thrust . Her ass bounces as I slam into her , and my eyes squeeze shut as I fall forward , gripping her waist . I ’m breathing hard , and her face turns to the side , searching . I cover her mouth with mine and kiss her long and full , tasting the bitter tang of the wine on her tongue . She kisses me back with matching need , and I slide my hand between her legs , finding her clit and circling as I rock my hips slowly , still deep inside her . A whimper aches from her throat , and I reach down to catch the condom , holding it as I pull out and quickly tying it off and tossing it into the trash . Then I flip her onto her back placing my mouth right between her thighs and kissing her there , sucking and pulling her clit with my tongue and teeth . It does n’t take much before she ’s bucking against my face . Her fingers thread in my hair , and she moans so loud . I keep going until she ’s pushing away from me , writhing in the blankets and begging me to stop . Rising up , I climb onto the bed beside her and pull her against my chest feeling satisfied and so damn good . We were supposed to sort out this thing between us when we got back from the mountains , but between Taron leaving , following up on Marley , and preparing for this gala , it seemed easier to fall back into our work roles . I know there are conversations we need to have . Two very important conversations in particular . Still , in this moment , with this beautiful woman in my arms , I ca n’t imagine willingly taking us into difficult situations . At least not yet . What happened in the past , what ’s coming in the future , none of it will change if we wait a few hours more . One more day . We ’ve come this far , after all . These thoughts are drifting quietly through my mind when I notice her breathing has turned into that soft , rhythmic sound of sleep . I kind of love that sound . My eyes are closed , and I follow her to that place of rest , where there is no fighting . Where we can simply be together , safe in each other ’s arms . “
67641	67645	67631	67631	her	1229	“ Almost done . ”
67661	67679	67646	67646	I	0	“ Head on down to the lobby bar . I ’ll meet you there in five minutes . ”
67680	67694	67695	67695	We	1228	“ I ’m calling the car , so do n’t be too long . ”
67979	67990	67971	67971	her	1241	“ You look like you ’ve been struck by lightning . ”
67998	68003	67971	67971	her	1241	“ You ’re stunning . ”
68055	68066	68067	68067	She	1241	“ We should just call it and head back upstairs . ”
68082	68113	68067	68067	She	1241	“ I thought we were here on business , Mr. Fletcher . This gala is a very important event , and you do n’t want Jerry representing you at it . ”
68133	68173	68126	68126	I	0	“ It ’s true . We might have to make a pitstop in the lavatory when we get there . I do n’t know how much longer I can look at you in this dress without ripping it off . ”
68188	68199	68200	68200	She	1241	“ This is a very expensive dress , Mr. Fletcher . ”
68211	68222	68223	68224	Our driver	1247	“ I should know . I bought it for you . ”
68247	68262	68232	68232	she	1241	“ When we get back , you can do what you want with it . ”
68283	68292	68272	68272	I	0	“ Do n’t worry , I intend to . ”
68354	68362	68349	68349	Rocky	119	“ Let ’s get out and walk . ”
68380	68391	68363	68363	I	0	“ Are you sure ? It ’s a little ways … ”
68392	68397	68398	68398	She	1241	“ I ’m sure . ”
68453	68462	68445	68445	She	1241	“ You should wear this color more often . ”
68483	68492	68493	68493	She	1241	“ You might not get any work done … ”
68510	68518	68499	68499	I	0	“ I ’m very good at multitasking . ”
68577	68582	68568	68568	She	1241	“ Take my picture . ”
68645	68651	68634	68634	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
68652	68659	68666	68666	She	1241	“ Texting it to my phone . ”
68660	68665	68666	68666	She	1241	“ No … wait — ”
68691	68695	68678	68678	I	0	“ Sexy devil ? ”
68711	68716	68704	68704	her	1241	“ Is this me ? ”
68717	68722	68723	68723	She	1241	“ Give me that . ”
68760	68779	68751	68751	she	1241	“ It ’s rude to read someone else ’s phone . Has n’t anyone ever told you that ? ”
68780	68800	68751	68751	she	1241	“ You gave it to me to take your picture . I was just sending a copy to myself . ”
68801	68810	68811	68811	Chuckling	230	“ Next time I ’ll take a selfie . ”
68820	68840	68813	68813	I	0	“ Why are you embarrassed ? I feel like now I need to change your name in my phone . “
68848	68855	68813	68813	I	0	” She blinks up to me . “

68874	68898	68899	68899	I	0	” She pushes my arm and walks quickly toward the building . I laugh , catching up to her and taking her arm . “
68931	68983	68984	68984	Patton	933	” She shakes her head , and I thread our fingers again , leading her to the growing crowd of attendees waiting at the door to have their invitations checked against the master list . We ’re just at the front when I hear a voice that makes my neck tighten . “
68994	69054	68990	68990	Patton	933	” Looking around , I see Jerry bobbing in the line , midway back and waving . Rocky moves away from me , sliding her hand out of mine . An acute sense of annoyance filters through my stomach . I ’m not smiling when I turn to find him moving through the crowd to where we ’re waiting . “
69067	69079	69055	69055	I	0	” I murmur when he reaches us , shaking my hand . “
69089	69097	69055	69055	I	0	” he laughs , turning to Rocky . “
69108	69156	69157	69157	Angel	234	” He starts to move toward her , but she moves back . Instead , he quickly changes directions , pulling forward a blonde with a short pixie cut and a bright red dress . Angelique Johnson is our go - to realtor on the West Coast . “
69159	69175	69176	69176	Patton	933	” I lean forward in a brief hug , and she air kisses my cheek . “
69185	69186	69176	69176	Patton	933	” “
69198	69207	69208	69208	Angel	234	” Jerry motions between the three of us . “
69233	69239	69225	69225	She	651	” The woman smiles broadly . “
69256	69257	69248	69248	I	0	” “
69261	69265	69248	69248	I	0	” Rocky smiles . “
69274	69280	69248	69248	I	0	” Jerry jumps in again . “
69319	69390	69305	69305	She	651	” They both laugh at his corny joke , and Rocky forces a light titter . I look at her strangely , and her cheeks flush . Then her hand slides up the back of my arm and gives me a tiny pinch . My eyes narrow , and I smile , but it ’s a warning . Somebody wants to get spanked . Rocky returns to the other two . “
69411	69412	69419	69419	LA	285	” “
69421	69453	69454	69454	I	0	” Angel takes her arm as we arrive at the front of the line . I hang back with Jerry showing our invitations and waiting for them to check the lists . “
69466	69480	69462	69462	Raquel	651	” Jerry ’s studying me with an intensity I do n’t care for . “
69486	69490	69491	69491	I	0	” He nods , “
69504	69511	69512	69512	Raquel	651	” I did n’t expect it . “
69535	69550	69519	69519	She	651	” Anger flares in Jerry ’s eyes , and he takes a step back . “
69566	69582	69563	69563	my	0	” My jaw tightens , and I turn to face him , matching his tone . “
69600	69601	69593	69593	Raquel	651	” “

69628	69644	69622	69622	You	1267	” My tone is final , but he ’s turning my decision into a snub . “

69680	69681	69675	69675	Taron	121	” “
69688	69705	69706	69706	She	651	” Angel and Rocky stroll back to where we ’re speaking in low , heated tones . “
69713	69714	69715	69715	She	651	” “
69726	69756	69720	69720	she	651	” The ladies are back with us , and Rocky smiles , meeting my eyes . Our chemistry is strong , and I wait too long before blinking away . “
69760	69767	69720	69720	she	651	” Jerry ’s tone is cynical . “
69773	69774	69720	69720	she	651	” “
69778	69815	69720	69720	she	651	” Angel blinks between the two of us , but Jerry ’s eyes are fixed on me . He ’s grinning like he just figured out some new angle , and I do n’t like it . “
69824	69837	69822	69822	Ang	235	” He starts to go , but pauses after a few steps . “
69867	69894	69854	69854	We	1273	” As far as I ’m concerned , the conversation is closed , but I ’m not in the mood to deal with him right now . “
69901	69902	69895	69895	We	1273	” “
69927	69972	69895	69895	We	1273	” My eyes narrow , and I try to figure out what he ’s planning . Rocky is at my side , so I ’ll let it go for now , but this asshole better not think he ’s going to push me around . “
69977	69980	69895	69895	We	1273	” 25 Raquel “
69994	70072	69895	69895	We	1273	” We ’ve slipped out to the narrow walkway along the outside of the observatory , overlooking the city . We ’ve somehow managed to be alone , and it ’s magical … like a fairytale . I ’m here in this beautiful dress at this elegant ball . A glass of wine is in my hand , and the music from inside is loud enough to be heard . Patton holds my hand as we stroll . “
70083	70090	70091	70091	She	234	” He glances over at me . “
70095	70162	70091	70091	She	234	” We take a few more steps , and I look up at the sky . The yellow , orange , and red has transformed to pink , blue , and deep purple , and I exhale deeply , pausing beside the wall . Patton ’s warm hand slides across my bare back , and it feels good . I lean my head against his shoulder . “
70171	70188	70091	70091	She	234	” I think I ’ve fallen in love with this city . He exhales a laugh . “
70201	70202	70091	70091	She	234	” “
70212	70238	70091	70091	She	234	” We ’re quiet , watching the twinkling stars , the lights of LA spread like a glittering blanket below . I get to thinking . “
70248	70277	70091	70091	She	234	” The two of them seemed to be having a heated conversation when Angel and I returned from our stroll , and they ’ve been scarce ever since . “
70283	70284	70091	70091	She	234	” “
70295	70311	70312	70312	Jerry	1815	” He pushes off the wall and starts to walk again , holding my hand . “
70336	70404	70405	70405	He	1815	” Fear tightens my throat . It ’s the one thing able to burst my dreamy bubble . I would n’t put it past Jerry to try and make something out of Patton ’s and my relationship . I ’ve worried before about the wisdom of sleeping with my boss . Too bad wisdom always seems to take a backseat whenever Patton ’s sexy ass is around . “
70416	70452	70453	70453	He	1815	” I try to calm my nervous thoughts . I ’m probably misreading the situation . Why would n’t Jerry be happy here ? It ’s a great place . He ’s his own boss . “
70458	70467	70453	70453	He	1815	” He stops , turning to face me . “

70508	70601	70602	70602	I	0	” I blink up briefly and give him a smile . A heavy brass door bangs open , and we drop our hands . Two party guests stumble out into the night and I take the opportunity to return to the party . We ’ve spent the night swapping business cards and shaking hands . Remington Key is here , and he greets Patton , introducing himself to me . He ’s very friendly and congratulates me on taking over Taron ’s old spot . Shaking hands with Patton , he smiles . “

70642	70651	70640	70640	Remington	127	” My forehead scrunches , and he grins . “
70661	70687	70658	70658	Everyone	459	” He ’s handsome and clearly wealthy . His suit is very fine , and I see a Rolex watch peeping from beneath his sleeve . “
70702	70727	70658	70658	Everyone	459	” Patton puts his arm around my waist and moves me to his other side , away from our financial partner . Remi laughs . “
70752	70761	70762	70762	We	1283	” Patton puts his hand on his shoulder . “

It ’s late as we stroll out to the car , and I ’m feeling the time difference again . Still , I pause for one last look at the valley below , the Hollywood sign above , and the flickering stars . It truly is unforgettable . “
70918	71064	71065	71065	I	0	” Patton ’s voice is pure business . It ’s how he ’s been since we saw Jerry at the gala last night . I ’m sitting in the passenger ’s seat of a rented Audi coupe . Based on our day yesterday , I ’d expected things to get crazy when we got back to the penthouse . Instead , he was distracted . He spent some time working on his computer before joining me in the bed . We made sweet love , but I quietly hung my blue dress neatly in the closet and slipped into one of his tees . Nothing was torn or wild — not that I ’m complaining . Being held in Patton ’s arms while he kisses me gently and fucks me hard is about the best thing I ’ve experienced since I graduated from business school . “
71081	71082	71065	71065	I	0	” “
71092	71287	71085	71085	You	1286	” I do n’t think he ’s trying to start an argument . I think this is more of his distraction , but my old nature wants to point out how much I ’ve done and learned since I joined Fletcher International , Inc. Instead , I let it go , choosing to watch his square jaw flex attractively as he chews another piece of nicotine gum . I have n’t seen him with a cigarette in days . It ’s a little victory , but a victory all the same . Another Round goes to Rocky , and this win fills me with happy warmth . Truthfully , I ’m a bit distracted myself , thinking about Renée . I have n’t checked in with her since my text before Pigeon Forge . It ’s the longest we ’ve gone without talking , and it has me uneasy . I feel certain Hazel would call me if she had any trouble , still , I do n’t like to go too long without hearing her voice . Patton pulls into a parking space in front of a mid - rise glass office building . “
71312	71313	71304	71304	We	1287	” “
71316	71389	71304	71304	We	1287	” I smile and follow him into the building . We step off the elevator into a modern , stainless steel and concrete interior . It ’s all white with sparse furnishings . It seems to be the trend in West Coast design these days . Minimalistic , or monastic , depending on who you ask . Jerry is alone when we enter the conference room , and Patton is immediately annoyed . “
71395	71396	71397	71397	They	1288	” “
71421	71459	71416	71416	you	1289	” My throat tightens , my eyes cut to Patton . Jerry ’s trying to set him up , and even I know that ’s a bad idea . Patton only gets fiercer when he feels cornered . “
71464	71482	71483	71483	You	1289	” Patton ’s grin is relaxed , and he pulls out a chair , taking a seat . “
71491	71492	71483	71483	You	1289	” “
71521	71534	71536	71536	I	0	” Jerry ’s smile is conniving , and my hands are clammy . “
71540	71554	71536	71536	I	0	” My voice is soft , and Patton gives me a reassuring smile . “
71563	71564	71536	71536	I	0	” “
71580	71616	71626	71626	Buckingham	1815	” I do n’t like the sound of that . I pull out a chair at the other end of the table , closest to the door , and try to calm my galloping heart . “
71628	71698	71626	71626	Buckingham	1815	” Patton leans forward , propping his forearms on the table . Black ink peeks out from the cuffs of his shirtsleeves , and it calms me slightly . Patton is a badass devil . Renée told me so herself . I ’m pretty sure he cares about me , and if anyone can handle a slime ball like Jerry it ’s him . My stomach starts to unclench . “
71712	71742	71705	71705	I	0	” Jerry sits in the chair directly across from Patton , and even though I ’m confident in my man , I do n’t like how gleeful Jerry seems . “
71763	71770	71775	71775	She	1821	” Patton ’s voice is level . “
71790	71791	71781	71781	she	1821	” “
71821	71831	71809	71809	I	0	” Patton laughs , leaning back in his chair . “

71861	71900	71854	71854	We	1295	” Jerry ’s brow lowers , and I decide he might be a devil himself . Only not the tall , dark , and sexy kind like Patton . Jerry ’s the short , red , spiteful kind . “
71936	71937	71910	71910	she	1821	” “
71941	72024	72025	72025	You	1821	” Patton says it like it ’s a given , and my eyebrows rise . Wow . It all happened so fast , I have n’t really thought through all of the details of taking over Taron ’s old job . Patton and I have n’t had the opportunity to discuss it . Now I wonder if it also means I ’ll get one of those massive corner offices . I ’m starting to feel pretty good about myself until Jerry continues . “
72063	72064	72060	72061	this firm	429	” “
72076	72094	72069	72069	you	1821	” Patton ’s voice is quiet calm . I ’m not saying a word . Jerry smiles . “
72131	72132	72126	72127	your father	1113	” “
72137	72156	72126	72127	your father	1113	” Patton ’s jaw tightens and the small hairs on the back of my neck start to rise . “
72203	72204	72205	72205	Limelight	238	” “
72207	72215	72205	72205	Limelight	238	” Jerry ’s voice is dangerously calm . “
72218	72232	72205	72205	Limelight	238	” He repeats the word in a way that makes my fingers tremble . “
72270	72285	72250	72250	women	1709	” My throat tightens , and I feel like I ’m having trouble breathing . “
72293	72309	72250	72250	women	1709	” Patton ’s voice is fierce . He ’s the tiger , ready to maul . “
72358	72378	72379	72379	Patton	121	” I ’m having trouble focusing . I feel like the air is being sucked out of the room . “
72381	72387	72379	72379	Patton	121	” My voice is small . “
72394	72395	72396	72396	I	0	” “
72401	72409	72396	72396	I	0	” A crack is in his voice . “

72418	72425	72396	72396	I	0	” Jerry chuckles and keeps going . “

72447	72456	72444	72444	You	1821	” My voice cuts through the thick tension . “
72476	72484	72491	72492	your boyfriend	651	” Jerry ’s eyes flash to me . “
72558	72670	72554	72556	Dolly Fucking Parton	239	” My heart is beating out of my chest . I want to stand up and shout at Jerry to shut up and stop talking about things he does n’t understand . Patton would never do that . Only … Renée ’s words , her strange silence when I told her I was sleeping with him . Her withdrawal . I hate him … He ’s the devil … These are things my mild - mannered sister never says about anybody . Oh , God , please say it ’s not true . The nausea in my stomach tells me I ’m afraid it is . Patton ’s eyes are flinty . “
72681	72682	72676	72676	You	1316	” “
72696	72702	72694	72694	Braden	131	” Patton ’s jaw flexes . “
72707	72716	72694	72694	Braden	131	” Jerry leans close , spitting the words . “
72729	72744	72694	72694	Braden	131	” With that , he turns on his heel and strides to the door . “
72770	72828	72829	72829	Patton	121	” He slams the door , and silence falls over the room . It ’s so silent , I can hear the second hand ticking on the clock above the door . I feel like I ’ve been hit by a freight train . I ’m breathing fast , trying to make sense of everything Jerry said . “
72831	72852	72829	72829	Patton	121	” My voice breaks . He does n’t answer immediately . He ’s silent , and his silence speaks volumes . “
72862	72876	72856	72856	he	121	” Dark eyes rise to mine , and I see guilt in them . “

72928	72936	72937	72939	A young woman	1323	” Protective anger twists in my chest . “
72941	72992	72993	72993	She	1323	” I think about my sister and what a bright , aspiring college graduate she was . I remember her getting this job and being so excited to join corporate America . Then I remember her eighteen months later , hiding in her apartment , refusing to return to work . “
73013	73030	73031	73031	I	0	” He looks at the table as if he ’s replaying the scene in his mind . “
73060	73070	73071	73071	He	358	” I feel the blood draining from my face . “

73079	73099	73071	73071	He	358	” His eyes cut to mine , and then he blinks down like he ca n’t hold my gaze . “

73211	73224	73204	73204	I	0	” I take a step back , giving him an incredulous look . “
73294	73307	73288	73288	You	1323	” Shaking my head , I know what I have to do . “
73326	73345	73346	73346	Rocky	119	” He ’s on his feet at once , crossing the room to me , reaching for me . “
73350	73360	73346	73346	Rocky	119	” Holding up my hand , I back away . “
73366	73390	73346	73346	Rocky	119	” I storm out the door before I start to cry , but he ’s right on my heels , catching my arm . “
73397	73409	73346	73346	Rocky	119	” My voice is savage as I jerk my arm away . “
73415	73420	73346	73346	Rocky	119	” My eyes flash . “

73526	73548	73555	73555	George	584	” My voice is a whip . My eyes flash , and that fight deep inside me rises to the surface . “
73557	73591	73592	73592	Rocky	119	” My phone buzzes , and I look up to see Javier in a red Honda Civic arriving to take me to the airport , the pink Lyft logo glowing in his windshield . “
73596	73615	73592	73592	Rocky	119	” He tries to reach for me again , but I pull away , stepping into the car . “
73633	73649	73628	73628	You	1329	” A tremor is in my voice , but rage is boiling away my tears . “
73658	73661	73628	73628	You	1329	” 26 Patton “
73675	73705	73628	73628	You	1329	” I ’m standing in Marley ’s living room watching him drink a Red Bull in pajama pants and a threadbare Phish tee . He makes a sarcastic face . “

73727	73758	73711	73711	I	0	” My voice rises , and I take a cigarette out of my pack . Lighting it , I inhale a long pull and exhale the stream of smoke slowly . “
73806	73813	73798	73799	Those guys	1855	” I add under my breath , “
73820	73838	73798	73799	Those guys	1855	” That asshole . I do n’t even want to hear what he ’d have to say . “
73844	73852	73853	73853	Everyone	459	” He reaches for his own cigarette . “
73864	73991	73853	73853	Everyone	459	” A fist of rage is in my chest . It ’s been like this since I got back from Los Angeles . Rocky walked out , and it all went to hell . Stalking to his balcony doors , I pull them open , studying the Nashville skyline . My mind trips back to standing with her in my arms , studying the view of Los Angeles . I push that memory aside . I was a fool to think I could have her after everything that happened . She ’s right . I ’m broken and cruel , and I injured the only family member she has left . I take another long pull off my cigarette , blowing the smoke out the doors . “
74000	74001	73853	73853	Everyone	459	” “
74012	74039	74002	74002	You	1339	” As pissed as I am , what he did still hurts . Turning my back to the doors , I look directly into his eyes . “
74048	74061	74045	74045	I	0	” He shakes his head , breaking eye contact , seeming defeated . “
74068	74075	74045	74045	I	0	” It ’s not good enough . “

74131	74144	74147	74147	she	1341	” His head snaps up at that , and his brow furrows . “
74158	74187	74188	74188	She	1341	” I want to say ‘ because of you , ’ but that would be a lie . She left because of me , and I know it . “
74228	74240	74242	74242	Jerry	1815	” He shakes his head , exhaling a cloud of smoke . “
74247	74248	74249	74249	I	0	” “
74253	74259	74249	74249	I	0	” His eyebrows shoot up . “
74262	74267	74249	74249	I	0	” I ’m surprised . “

74314	74347	74284	74284	He	1815	” I still have n’t figured out how he knew what happened with Renée . I did n’t even tell Taron why she resigned . A bitter chuckle scrapes from his throat . “
74369	74380	74381	74381	I	0	” My jaw tightens , and my patience is done . “

74462	74511	74512	74512	She	1351	” Grinding out my cigarette , I scoop up my phone and my keys and head out the door . I ’m back in my office by noon , and Sandra ’s at her desk , typing away . Our eyes meet , and she shakes her head . “
74520	74555	74512	74512	She	1351	” Glancing toward Rocky ’s office , I see her lights are off , but the books and photos she brought in are still on her desk . She would n’t leave those behind . “

74627	74972	74618	74618	She	651	” Hazel eyes cut up to me in accusation , but I turn and go into my office . Dropping into my chair , I want another cigarette . Instead , I pull up the office flowchart . I ’ve lost three people in as many days . Marley is more than capable of taking over Taron ’s accounts , especially with the way Taron left them . We could hire an intern to keep our social media presence going . Hell , it might be a better use of resources , considering how adept college kids are with that shit . Los Angeles is another story . Rocking back in my chair , I reflect on my solo plane trip home from the West Coast . Despite what she said , Rocky is still a smart business person . My mind trips further back in time , four years ago , Marley was in my office sitting on the couch confused . He told me how sweet Renée was . He told me how she liked helping little animals and she was always telling him about some cause or the other she wanted to support . He told me how beautiful he thought she was . He told me he could n’t stop thinking about her . I ’d never seen him act that way about any woman . Usually he treated them like they were disposable , use them and lose them . I told him to leave her alone . As usual , he did n’t listen . Not that I ’m any better . I was stupid to let myself pursue Rocky the way I did . I got greedy . I was lonely , and I let my guard down . Admitting this weakness makes me angry . It makes my throat tight . I should ’ve known better . Love is n’t what I do . I do n’t give anyone that level of power over me … My phone buzzes , and I snatch up the receiver . “
74980	74988	74989	74989	She	1352	” Sandra ’s on the other end . “
75000	75103	74989	74989	She	1352	” I hang up as the last word comes out of her mouth . Straightening my coat , I take a beat before opening the door . Seeing her is like a kick in the stomach . It ’s been three days since she left me in LA , and I think she ’s even prettier . She ’s wearing ripped jeans and a khaki top with beige heels , and Sandra ’s right . She ’s moving around her desk like the building ’s on fire . I close the space between us quickly and tap lightly on her open door . “
75106	75129	74989	74989	She	1352	” When she looks up and sees me , her lips tighten . I think she ’s clenching her jaw at me . “
75138	75156	74989	74989	She	1352	” She looks away and continues putting her few possessions in the canvas bag on her desk . “
75178	75193	75169	75169	I	0	” She reaches into her purse and pulls out a business - sized envelope . “
75202	75236	75237	75237	You	0	” A tremble is in her hand , and I wonder what it means . Is she nervous ? Is she sad ? Is this killing her as much as it is me ? “
75248	75258	75237	75237	You	0	” Her blue eyes flash , and I shrug . “
75265	75266	75237	75237	You	0	” “
75276	75323	75237	75237	You	0	” The last of her things are in the bag , and she pulls the straps over her shoulder . She takes a step toward the door , but I step in front of her , closing it behind me and putting my back against it . “
75335	75336	75237	75237	You	0	” “
75349	75361	75367	75367	Patton	121	” My hands go up , and hers do the same . “
75369	75407	75367	75367	Patton	121	” That ’s when I hear the crack in her voice , and I know . This is n’t as easy for her as she ’s trying to make it seem . I might have a chance . “
75433	75442	75427	75427	You	0	” She rocks back , crossing her arms . “
75452	75453	75443	75443	You	0	” “
75463	75475	75454	75454	I	0	” I pause a moment to let the idea sink in . “
75505	75506	75502	75502	your	0	” “
75514	75531	75502	75502	your	0	” Her voice is terse . My hands go in my pockets , and I nod . “
75553	75647	75545	75545	you	0	” A weight is in my chest as I say it . I do n’t want to send her to LA . I want her here . All of this is fucking bullshit . If she would just listen to me … Blinking quickly , she turns her face toward the window . Her throat moves with a swallow , and my eyes trace the line of her jaw , the sweep of her golden - brown hair , her soft neck . Clearing my throat , I move away from her door . “
75664	75680	75656	75656	You	1357	” I turn the envelope in my hand and slide it into my breast pocket . “
75692	75730	75681	75681	I	0	” She inhales slowly then cuts those pretty blue eyes to me . The freckles on her nose make her seem so young . What will it take to win her back ? Is it even possible ? “
75736	75957	75732	75732	I	0	” Impatience is in her tone , and I step to the side , allowing her to pass . She leaves me in a swirl of coconut and ginger that gets caught in my throat . She ’s so beautiful as she walks out the door . 27 Raquel Renée is n’t answering her phone . Since I got home Friday night , I ’ve been pacing my small apartment trying to reach her . I spent Saturday in bed and let myself cry . Sunday , I got up and took a shower . I forced myself to walk around the block , to go to the grocery store and buy food . It was all I could do before it started again . I ’m not sobbing crying , but I ca n’t stop the tears streaming down my cheeks . I do n’t even know why I ’m crying . He does n’t deserve my tears . But my heart is broken … Of course , Renée is n’t answering her phone . I ’ve been over here sleeping with the enemy , betraying her with every story I tell . At the same time … she did n’t tell me anything . She could have warned me a little better instead of just issuing cryptic suggestions . “
75964	75968	75969	75969	He	1658	” she said . “
75974	76665	75969	75969	He	1658	” she said . Really , Renée ? I ’m so frustrated , I start packing my things . Seeing Patton in the office today almost broke me . I waited until I was sure he ’d be at lunch — of course , he was n’t . It was all I could do to stay focused , to not fucking cry , to keep my hands from shaking . To act like he did n’t hurt me with his lies … his omissions . Dropping to sit on my couch , I put my face in my hands . Fuck these stupid tears ! Why does he have to look so good ? His eyes were so open and pleading asking me to go to LA . As much as I hate to admit it , he ’s right about me quitting . Future employers wo n’t know what a conniving bastard he is . They wo n’t know how he destroyed the life of my sister without even looking back . All they ’ll see is I landed a plumb job straight out of business school at one of the top firms in Nashville , then I quit less than three weeks later . They ’ll think I could n’t hack it . Or they ’ll think I ’m a problem employee … In any case , it ’s a red flag . Exhaling a big sigh , I grab my suitcase and head for the door . I ’m going to make Renée talk to me , and I ’m going to force her to tell me the truth . I deserve to know what happened . It ’s almost nine when I ’m pulling into Savannah . Following the old , familiar roads , I wind my way down through Wilmington to my parent ’s old home in the tiny neighborhood where I grew up . So much has changed since I was a child here . Most of the smaller , older homes are gone , replaced by million - dollar mansions and country club estates . Savannah has become a dream destination , as my sister keeps telling me , and the population is steadily growing as more people relocate closer to the coast . I miss the days when it would be just us kids , running around the marsh lands , playing along the old piers , fishing with cane poles … Going with my daddy to WWE matches . More tears are on my cheeks . I ca n’t help thinking how Patton had started calling me Rocky . It feels so long ago since we were in the mountains , since he held me in his arms , and all I could think was how good it felt , how much I wanted him . No . I push those thoughts away . He does n’t deserve my fond memories . He lied to me the whole time . He knew what had happened to Renée , and he never said a word about it — even when I asked him point blank . He said he did n’t know how to tell me . Guess what ? He could ’ve told me the night I asked him . Shifting the car into park , I pause in front of the posh home in front of me . I have to double - check the number above the door . Yep , it ’s my parents ’ old place , but it looks … different . Good different . I ’m out the car , and the grass is cut and the neat sidewalk runs around the front like always . But now I ’m walking up new wooden steps to a pristine wrap - around porch . The exterior , which was formerly vinyl siding is now stucco , and large , dark - brown shutters line the long windows across the front , making them seem more like French doors . Going to the life - sized ceramic sea turtle on the corner , I pat his head . “
76670	76807	75969	75969	He	1658	” Then I flip him over and shake , hearing the familiar clinking of the key hidden inside him . When I get the front door open , I ’m even more amazed . The wood floors have been redone . The wall that divided the kitchen from the formal dining room we never used has been removed , and now it has a big , open floor plan . Our three tiny bedrooms are still down the small hall directly across from me , but to the left , an entire room has been added with a large television and couches and chairs . Dropping my small suitcase , I walk around the new kitchen , taking a glass from the refinished cabinets and filling it with ice and water from the new Viking refrigerator . “
76810	76956	75969	75969	He	1658	” I call , but I do n’t get an answer . I ’m starting to get worried until I walk down the hall to my bedroom , and I hear the sound of a shower running . It looks like the bathroom my dad started off his and mom ’s old bedroom — the one he never finished — has been finished . I go into my room , which now looks like a fancy guest room straight out of Pottery Barn and put my small suitcase on the bed . A card on the dresser lists the wifi address and password , which makes me frown . Now I ’m not sure what ’s going on here . Stepping into the hall again , the noise of the shower has stopped , and a voice is on the other side of the door singing “
76960	77038	75969	75969	He	1658	” by the Doors . That is my sister . Knocking on the door , I open it as I say her name , and I jump almost a mile in the air when she closes her eyes and screams bloody murder . She screams so loud , my ears pierce . I wind up screaming as well out of pure shock . Once we stop , I fall back against the wall , clutching my chest . “
77051	77052	77043	77043	You	1359	” “
77061	77185	77043	77043	You	1359	” Her voice is loud , and she ’s gasping , clutching a towel to her chest . She ’s wearing gray sweats and a long - sleeved pink tee . Her brown hair is wet , and it ’s getting her shirt wet . Then our eyes meet , and she starts to laugh . My nerves are completely shot and my emotions are so strung out … I start to laugh , too . We both laugh . We laugh so hard , I ’m crying again , and I step forward to give her a hug , holding her a minute as she pets my head . She steps back , squeezing the ends of her hair with the towel . “
77212	77244	77245	77245	I	0	” Touching the tears from my eyes , I do n’t miss the accusation in her question , but I ’m past all that . I simply shrug , acting casual . “
77276	77293	77294	77294	I	0	” She hangs the towel on a hook inside the bathroom and calls over her shoulder . “
77352	77353	77354	77354	You	1360	” “
77364	77402	77354	77354	You	1360	” My eyes heat , and I feel so stupid . My emotions are so fragile . I ’m going to cry over kittens ? Stopping in front of me , her face scrunches with a frown . “
77411	77412	77354	77354	You	1360	” “
77417	77457	77354	77354	You	1360	” My throat aches , and when I close my eyes , two tears hit my cheeks . Nooo … I do n’t want to cry anymore , but my eyes have a mind of their own these days . “
77481	77527	77471	77471	I	0	” It ’s so late , and I ’m so tired . I do n’t know what I want to say to her , but I ca n’t do it tonight . Instead , I hug her again , placing my face against her shoulder . “
77534	77577	77529	77530	Patton Fletcher	933	” Her voice is not scolding . It ’s protective and warm , just like a big sister ought to be . How long has it been since she was able to help me like this ? I do n’t even care . “
77586	77621	77580	77580	I	0	” Lifting my head , our eyes meet . Her hazel ones are so full of concern , I want to talk to her about this , but I ca n’t do it tonight . “
77627	77628	77580	77580	I	0	” “
77682	77762	77676	77676	you	1360	” I do n’t bother reminding her I do n’t like hot tea . I ’m too tired , and honestly , with the way my insides are , I ’m willing to try anything if it helps me feel less devastated . Following her into the kitchen , I sit at the long table across from the bar as she fills the kettle . Looking around at the modern appliances , I ca n’t hold back any longer . “
77769	77788	77676	77676	you	1360	” She pauses , seeming confused . She follows my eyes around the room then returns to me . “

77897	77935	77889	77889	I	0	” Listening to her explaining makes me smile in spite of myself . Renée rambles just like I do when she ’s nervous . It ’s soothing being with her , feeling our family connection so strong . “

78100	78134	78073	78073	I	0	” Nodding , she puts two scoops of tea in a silver infuser and places it in a mug . Then she takes another canister and repeats the process with a different tea . “

78261	78329	78250	78250	I	0	” It ’s true . She always tells me she ’s fine , but I never believe her . I ’ve been living in fear she ’s going to have another breakdown when the reality is , she ’s putting her accounting degree to work and making a buttload of money . Walking to where I ’m sitting , she puts the mug in front of me . “

78443	78455	78456	78456	I	0	” Shaking my head , I look down at my mug . “
78464	78504	78456	78456	I	0	” Her lips tighten , and she takes the strainer out of her mug , watching me closely as she sips her tea . Inhaling a shaky breath , I do the same . Then I pull back quickly . “

78557	78625	78626	78626	I	0	” She shakes her head like it ’s a travesty . I take another sip , and I do n’t know if it ’s the warmth of the liquid or the relief of finding my sister okay and thriving … Or if it ’s because I just drove almost eight hours today after not really sleeping for three days … Or if it ’s my broken heart . “

78708	78754	78691	78691	You	0	” I nod , feeling like I ’m eleven years old again . She goes to the door , and I toe off my shoes . I do n’t even remove my jeans . As soon as I hit the mattress , I ’m asleep . “
78763	78815	78691	78691	You	0	” I ’m standing beside my sister with my arms over a five - gallon fish tank filled with blankets and a heating pad as she holds the head of a kitten so tiny it ’s little eyes are n’t even open yet . It ’s the size of my palm . “
78826	78842	78819	78819	I	0	” I whisper . My hands shake , and my heart is beating too fast . “
78866	78886	78859	78859	I	0	” I watch as she uses a Q - tip to swab the tiny thing ’s eyes with antibiotics . “
78916	78958	78906	78906	she	79	” She takes the kitten from me and puts it back in its chenille - blanket cocoon inside the incubator . Then she takes a teeny black kitten and hands it to me . I watch as she repeats the process . “
78991	79009	78984	78984	He	1382	” Placing the small animal back in the incubator , she closes the lid and watches them . “
79022	79035	79010	79010	They	1383	” Straightening , she heads for the door of her small shed . “
79070	79092	79093	79093	They	1383	” I hesitate a moment , watching the little creatures bob their tiny heads before burrowing down and falling asleep again . “

79105	79124	79100	79100	They	1383	” She waits for me at the door , and I walk slowly to where she ’s standing . “
79137	79152	79100	79100	They	1383	” I follow her out to where two bikes are waiting near the gate . “

79228	79319	79215	79215	I	0	” She pedals faster , and I pump to keep up . So far , since I got up this morning , after a quick breakfast of yogurt and fruit … and coffee . I insisted she let me make coffee , and we ’ve been making the kitten rounds … or cat rounds . We fed all ten of the cats that live at Ms. Hazel ’s sprawling old place . These neonatal kittens are new , but Renée insists they ’re not as much work as they seem . “
79329	79336	79215	79215	I	0	” I call from behind her . “

79414	79603	79373	79373	Airbnb	243	” We pedal down the familiar lanes , past towering oak trees with their black trunks and dark green leaves hanging low over the roads . We bump over wooden bridges and quiet two - lane highways . It ’s just like we used to do as kids , running to the beach to spend the day . Finally , we ’re out to the path that crosses Bull River . We abandon our bikes on the brown sand and jog out to the water . Renée ’s white skirt whips in the breeze , but I ’m in skinny capri pants . The tide is out , but the sand is wet , and the wind blows our hair back . It really is like we ’re kids again . We did this every single day when school was out , playing on the beach like mermaids who ’d just been given legs . When we ’re out of breath , we start to walk , side by side , headed nowhere in particular . After several minutes of silence , my sister glances at me sideways . “
79613	79677	79373	79373	Airbnb	243	” Am I ? I do n’t know . I take a deep breath that does little to ease the pain of the hole in my chest . If anybody can help me , it ’s the person walking beside me — and not just because she ’s a key factor in what happened , but because she knows me better than anyone . “
79690	79703	79704	79704	I	0	” Her chin pulls back like she ’s surprised by the question . “

79765	79773	79763	79763	Rocky	119	” She looks up at the sky . “

She says I can stop worrying about her , and I see she ’s right . Only … now what ? Rubbing my forehead , I try to figure out what I ’m supposed to do . Should I go to California ? If she ’s okay , I can at least protect my career … and I wo n’t have to see him . Pain like a knife twists in my heart . An image of me pinned naked against Patton ’s bare chest under a waterfall , his strong arms over mine , his hands in my hair , his possessive gaze … I wo n’t have to see him . Fresh tears flood my eyes . Why does that feel even worse ? 28 Patton “
81316	81392	81309	81309	Taron	121	” Marley is in my office , and I ’m staring out the window thinking of dark hair and blue eyes . Seven days , and I still ca n’t shake the feeling of her in my arms . I ca n’t stop remembering a brief moment in time when I felt good , a moment when I could stop fighting . A moment when I let go , and the past did n’t matter . “

81865	81873	81874	81875	Mary Jones	246	” Then he holds up a résumé . “

81895	81939	81892	81893	another woman	1432	” I flip through the ones I ’m holding , discarding the females . I can feel his eyes on me , but I do n’t care how it makes me look in my own office with just the two of us present . “
81949	81957	81892	81893	another woman	1432	” Marley gives me a confused look . “

82170	82327	82149	82149	You	1435	” He ’s back to flipping pages , and I study him a moment . Marley is more than a fuck up . The thing with Renée , well , I ’ve gone over how that situation broke down in my mind so many times , I ca n’t do it anymore . I was inexperienced at being a CEO , I thought you could handle an office the way you handle a group of Marines … Renée did n’t argue with me . Hell , she barely spoke . I asked her what she wanted , how much money it would take , and she wilted like a flower . Then Marley went off the rails . At least for now , it seems he ’s cut back on the partying . If only he ’ll stay on the wagon . Nobody falls off quite as spectacularly as my friend . He grumbles at me . “

82374	82396	82367	82367	He	1815	” I wonder how long he was courting them behind my back . Jobs like that do n’t just appear overnight . “
82406	82415	82416	82416	I	0	” He slaps another résumé to the side . “
82429	82471	82416	82416	I	0	” Stephen Hastings is no walk in the park . At least he ’ll let us run our business . A knock on my door draws my attention . I look up to see Sandra standing there with a puzzled expression . “

82486	82499	82480	82481	Alex Whitehead	651	” I cut my eyes at Marley , and he only shrugs . “

82866	82936	82843	82844	my God	1812	” I study the stack of papers in front of me . Remembering how that all went down . Remembering the shattered look in Rocky ’s eyes . I want a drink . Or a fucking cigarette . Slipping my hand into the pocket of my blazer , I pop another white square out of the blister packet and put it in my mouth . Sandra ’s eyebrow cocks . “

83133	83190	83110	83110	I	0	” Friday night at AJ ’s gets more crowded as the evening wears on . A live band plays a mix of country covers and what I assume are originals . We are in Music City , after all . Marley and I are sitting at a high top table on the patio overlooking the skyline . “
83198	83207	83192	83192	Jerry	1815	” He ’s sipping an O’Doul ’s Amber . “
83224	83242	83243	83243	He	1815	” I ’m on my third whiskey , so it ’s less painful to talk about it . “

83320	83349	83310	83310	Rocky	119	” She used to wrestle with her dad … I ’ve got to stop this now . He ’s strangely quiet , and I glance up at him . “

Marley waves that he ’s fine for now , and we both fall silent . The band ’s not bad , but I ’m not in the mood to feel good . I ’ve never felt like this about a woman , like I ’m not sure how I ’ll put her out of my mind . “
83471	83497	83463	83463	She	240	” Marley holds the empty bottle , turning it in his hands . I ca n’t answer that , and he adds under his breath . “
83507	83592	83463	83463	She	240	” My phone buzzes , and I take it out of my breast pocket . A text from Sandra ’s on the face : Jerry ’s running his mouth . She sends me a link , and when I tap on it , it takes me to a brief in Nashville Notes , a rinky - dink online journal run by the Nashville Association of Business and Industry . I scan it , and the more I read , the hotter my blood gets . “

83653	83669	83716	83717	Taron Rhodes	121	” My hand tightens on my fresh glass of whiskey , and I read aloud . “
83781	83811	83767	83769	former Fletcher CPA	249	” I ca n’t read any more of this bullshit . Tapping the number in my contacts , I wait as it rings . Marley ’s face is pale . “

84344	84380	84381	84381	Colleen	254	” Marley ’s pulling on my shoulder , and my eyes flare . The waitress ’s expression turns to fear , and she takes a step back , doing a little wave toward the bar . “

84490	84542	84486	84486	We	1467	” She puts her hand on the bouncer ’s arm , and says something quietly . I ’m behind Marley heading to the door . Pinching the bridge of my nose , I close my eyes as we descend , trying to stop my fury . Trying to think this through . “

On his arm is a blonde , and I see he ’s with Chip Braden . The two see me at the same time , and while Chip looks smug , Jerry ’s face goes white . My fist clenches , and it ’s too late for clear thinking . Lunging forward , I catch Jerry by the collar as he tries to run . “
84705	84769	84770	84770	Patton	933	” His voice breaks on a scream as I punch him in the face . Damn , that felt good is quickly followed by screaming pain . I might have broken my hand . I do n’t give a shit . I ’m pulling back to hit him again , harder , when Marley has me around the bicep , pulling me back . “

Every day we do our cat care … Every night , too , with the tiny kittens . I feel like a new mom getting up every four hours to help her bottle - feed Binky and Midnight . After breakfast , we ride our bikes out to the beach and walk around , then we do whatever Ms. Hazel needs at the store in the afternoons . Today she has us doing inventory to get ready for the holiday rush . Renée and I have talked about everything except why I ’m here . I know she ’s waiting . I ’m waiting . I ’m afraid if I start talking about Patton , I ’ll start crying again , and thankfully , the water works have stopped . I ’ve only heard from him once since I got here , a lone text sent late on Wednesday night , after I ’d gone to bed . None of this works without you . Reading it made my heart beat too fast . It made the tears start again . I cried myself to sleep and was late to help her on that day , and now , just remembering it , my chest aches . I still have n’t decided what to do about California , and my time is almost up . I ’ve got to do something . Can I honestly work with him when I still feel this way ? “

86083	86099	86076	86076	they	1482	” She catches my eye and winks . I do my best to smile back . “

86170	86203	86204	86204	He	1477	” I think about him cooking me hot chicken , holding me back from seeing the secret recipe . I think about that crazy place where we got pancakes in the mountains . “

86277	86297	86272	86272	Marley	358	” My voice trails off as I remember the mountains … His mom mattered . I think I mattered … “
86311	86343	86303	86303	I	0	” She keeps scanning . I ’m almost to the bottom of my box . I pull out a blown - glass Christmas ornament and study the red and green lines . “
86368	86378	86363	86363	You	1485	” Her brow furrows , and she stops scanning . “

86778	86832	86833	86833	I	0	” She gives me a nudge , and we head to the front of the store . Ms. Hazel is with a customer , so we smile and walk outside to where our bikes are waiting . We pedal slowly back to the house , and I look around , memorizing the scenery . “

86887	87018	86833	86833	I	0	” She waves a hand , and I follow her inside , watching the hem of her skirt sway as I think . Renée has always been more of a girly - girl , wearing skirts and beads . She likes drinking tea and not wearing makeup . Suits are not her style . Thinking of her in Patton ’s office , keeping up with their corporate lifestyle … Of course she felt like a fish out of water . We go to my room , and I take out my small suitcase and place items I ’m not going to use tonight inside . I ’m picking up my makeup when my phone starts to buzz on the dresser . I do n’t recognize the number on the screen . “

My sister is not sneaky . I ’m one hundred percent sure she would n’t say all the things she said about Patton if he gave her a bunch of money . Heck , I ’m more sure she would n’t take hush money if she had decided to say something … which now I know would n’t have been anything , since Patton is a bastard , but he ’s not the reason she walked away from her promising career . Her words , blended with mine . She collects the “

87946	87997	87939	87940	Patton Fletcher	933	” Pressing my lips together , I quickly pull up the Internet on my phone , searching for Nashville Notes . I do n’t have to dig . The second the site loads on my phone , I see the headline and teaser text at the top of the scroll . “

It ’s a Saturday , and I ’ve been in the office since the sun came up — busted hand , hangover , and all . Sandra has been screening my calls from realtors concerned about our clients , clients concerned about our realtors , media wanting more information . So far , our expansion seems to be intact . I was able to convince our new UAE guys the story is typical U.S. tabloid gossip — all hearsay from a disgruntled former employee trying to make us look bad . Those guys were all too familiar with such matters , and to my pleasant surprise , they were willing to take my word a retraction is in progress . That just leaves Hastings and Key . I ’m sure Remi is back from Seattle by now , but I ca n’t tell if the story has legs . It ’s possible , if I shut up and leave it alone … and stop calling publishers or punching assholes in the face … it might blow over . Leaning forward on my desk , I put my face in my hands . I ’m tired , and the only thing I can think about is Rocky . Does she know about this ? I have n’t heard from her since she walked out . I sent her one text this week , one night after a few drinks , and she never replied . Lifting my phone , I look at it now . None of this works without you . Shit , I cringe when I read it sober . I ’m never that open with people . The strange thing is , I want to be that open with her . She made me want things that never appealed to me before . I do n’t work without her . I do n’t care about any of this . The expansion , proving myself , what good is it if I ’m alone ? “
