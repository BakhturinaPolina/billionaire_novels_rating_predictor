291	333	280	280	she	385	“ She told me I needed a nose job . Also , is that Rafe ’s mistress lurking over by the bougainvillea ? I ’m sure Julienne would ’ve given her a one - star review for her performance in bed . ”

710	759	760	760	She	380	“ I do n’t know what her will says about a guardian for the baby , but this might be the best thing to ever happen to him . Unless Rafe ’s parents get him , and then the world — and that child — are all doomed . ”

2347	2363	2291	2291	I	2293	“ Hm . Maybe you should adopt another daughter . I always wanted a sister . ”
2364	2400	2291	2291	I	2293	“ I know , I know . You ’re busy being you . But my life is so fulfilled by you . I just want you to feel the same joy that having children brings . ”
2401	2404	2291	2291	I	2293	“ Wow . ”
2405	2423	2424	2424	I	2293	“ Good , right ? I had the congressman ’s speechwriter help me with that one too . ”
2501	2516	2517	2517	Mom	380	“ Your yacht ’s free for a week or two ? You ’re sure ? ”

3226	3229	3230	3230	I	2293	“ Who ? ”
3267	3302	3321	3321	Guy	112	“ Judgy Julie . Julienne Carter - Roderick . The woman who one - starred you for refusing to take a wall out to put that giant marble fountain in her baby ’s nursery ? ”
3303	3320	3321	3321	Guy	112	“ Ah . Right . Judgy Julie . She one - star her husband or something ? ”
3351	3355	3342	3342	I	2293	“ She died . ”
3372	3377	3356	3356	I	2293	“ She … died ? ”
3419	3533	3539	3539	She	469	“ They both did . She and her husband . Apparently fairly tragically . Smells like karma . I did n’t follow her — not after that horrible thing she said about your hammering skills not being able to arouse a gender - confused monkey , which was just rude — but I accidentally saw a review she posted of a baby sling last week where she tore it to shreds because it did n’t make her baby feel like he was sleeping on a pillow of clouds and the fabric was a shade too teal for anyone to not want to puke after looking at it . Who says stuff like that ? ”
3534	3538	3539	3539	She	469	“ Unhappy people . ”
3551	3583	3539	3539	She	469	“ I guess . She was just so awful to everyone . How long before she would ’ve one - starred her own kid for being a kid , you know ? ”
3612	3617	3618	3618	Becca	106	“ Sunset ’s pretty . ”
3621	3658	3618	3618	Becca	106	“ Okay . Moving on . Got it . Do you know every time we ’ve had burgers here , it ’s always been insanely crowded , and there ’s always been an open window seat ? ”

3797	3806	3789	3789	she	469	“ Do you want to be my girlfriend ? ”
3859	3862	3863	3863	I	2293	“ Gesundheit , ”
3895	3898	3899	3899	I	2293	“ Water ? ”
3925	3939	3940	3940	she	469	“ Jesus , West , warn a girl before you make a joke , ”
3972	3978	3969	3969	Becca	106	“ You … weren’t joking . ”
4001	4014	3996	3996	I	2293	“ About getting you a water ? I never joke about water . ”
4015	4025	4026	4026	She	380	“ About … the , erm , dating thing . ”
4124	4136	4137	4137	Her	380	“ Yeah . You got me . Sorry . Bad timing . ”
4170	4183	4164	4164	she	380	“ West , I — I do n’t know what to say . ”
4228	4235	4236	4236	I	2293	“ That ’s not a yes . ”
4324	4338	4318	4318	She	380	“ I just — I don’t — god , this is so hard . ”
4339	4348	4349	4349	I	2293	“ You do n’t see me like that , ”
4355	4363	4349	4349	I	2293	“ It ’s okay . Bad joke . ”
4364	4371	4372	4372	She	380	“ I — you — yes . ”
4379	4384	4372	4372	She	380	“ You ’re like — ”
4385	4389	4390	4390	Her	380	“ A brother . ”
4443	4459	4460	4460	she	380	“ You’re … very comfortable . And nice . And — very funny with jokes , ”
4551	4568	4547	4547	she	380	“ After the way you said your divorce went , I thought comfortable might be nice . ”
4573	4581	4569	4569	Her	380	“ Are you looking for just comfortable ? ”
4590	4652	4653	4653	She	380	“ Becca . We ’re not kids anymore . We ’ve both been burned . And you keep saying you do n’t want to be alone the rest of your life . I do n’t either , but I ca n’t see myself dating a twenty - something , and the dating pool is n’t exactly full for people our age . ”
4768	4773	4753	4753	I	2293	“ Who is he ? ”
4796	4822	4790	4790	Her	380	“ A dad I met at Mia ’s swim meet . He — he was her fourth - grade teacher . That was the year — ”
4823	4828	4790	4790	Her	380	“ You got divorced . ”
4829	4911	4790	4790	Her	380	“ He ’s a good guy . Also divorced . We just clicked . He coaches his son ’s little league team , which is why I had n’t seen him at swim meets until this weekend . The games always conflicted with swim practices . We ’re all going mini - golfing this weekend . It ’s not — I did n’t do it to hurt you . I did n’t realize you … thought this was going somewhere else . ”
4912	4922	4790	4790	Her	380	“ Not your fault . Forget I said anything . ”
5199	5204	5190	5190	Becca	106	“ Call you later , ”

5663	5669	5656	5657	Judgy Julie	110	“ What kind of issue ? ”
5670	5686	5600	5602	Dudes in suits	523	“ Just a small note . I ’m sure we can clear it up quickly . ”
5687	5702	5600	5602	Dudes in suits	523	“ If she ’s saying I still owe her work because of that statue — ”
5703	5750	5656	5657	Judgy Julie	110	“ No , sir . All ’s well . Relatively speaking . You ’ve been named as … well . Considering the sensitive nature of a will of this size and the relative fame of the recently deceased , I ’d prefer to speak in private . ”
5751	5759	5760	5760	I	2293	“ You could n’t send a letter ? ”
5792	5812	5783	5785	a gunnery sergeant	525	“ There ’s a time factor involved . You can follow me in your own vehicle if you wish . ”
5813	5817	5834	5837	Daisy Carter - Kincaid	155	“ To where ? ”
5818	5833	5834	5837	Daisy Carter - Kincaid	155	“ Daisy Carter - Kincaid ’s house in Bluewater on Key Biscayne , sir . ”

7407	7432	7433	7434	The woman	593	“ Five minutes , Mr. Jaeger . Please don’t — don’t let her scare you off . Mrs. Carter would be very put out . ”
7437	7455	7433	7434	The woman	593	“ Oh , a stripper from Gramalicious ? I did n’t know she had it in her . ”
7456	7459	7460	7460	I	2293	“ Daisy ? ”
7547	7561	7562	7562	My	2293	“ You gon na dance , or you just gon na stand there ? ”
7710	7715	7716	7716	Daisy	155	“ Woo , baby ! ”

8013	8025	8038	8038	She	155	“ Are you dancing with me , Daisy from Right Here ? ”
8026	8037	8038	8038	She	155	“ What can I say ? I love to dance . ”
8041	8053	8038	8038	She	155	“ And flirt . You gon na strip , or what ? ”
8208	8213	8214	8214	she	155	“ You strip often ? ”
8217	8223	8214	8214	she	155	“ Couple times a day . ”
8224	8227	8234	8234	She	155	“ Where ? ”
8228	8233	8234	8234	She	155	“ Usually my bathroom . ”
8287	8298	8299	8299	she	155	“ I think I like you , West from Everywhere , ”
8339	8347	8348	8348	I	2293	“ Let ’s leave it at that , ”
8365	8543	8544	8544	Daisy	155	“ C’m on , then . Let ’s see what else you ’ve got . I ’m about to whip the shirt over my head when a loud bang erupts behind us . I spin and crouch , ready to face danger , and find myself eyeball to eyeball with — fuck . Imogen Carter . She ’s a crusty one . And meticulous to boot . Julienne Carter - Roderick might ’ve officially been in charge of the nursery renovation , but her grandmother stopped by nearly every day to make sure the two - by - fours were straight enough and that none of my small crew were drinking . Surprised the hell out of me when she hired me to fix a few windowpanes in her solarium after that one - star review Julienne gave me , but she did , and she was even crustier the week I was on her solarium job . And that sour expression darkening her face is making even the dolphin chandelier above us wince and shrink back . “
8564	8576	8553	8553	Pierson	133	” she orders without taking her ice blue eyes off me . “
8583	8637	8580	8580	I	2293	” I open my mouth to remind her we ’ve met , then realize with people like this , it does n’t matter . She wo n’t remember me . I ’m just the hired help . Much like to the curvy , petite woman behind me , I ’m just the stripper . “
8642	8664	8580	8580	I	2293	” Daisy kills the music and tucks her phone into her cleavage , though she ’s still swaying to the beat . “
8690	8699	8678	8679	ol’ Piersy	134	” She lifts her glass with a grin . “
8739	8740	8732	8732	I	2293	” “
8745	8749	8741	8741	You	104	” Imogen sniffs . “
8757	8890	8741	8741	You	104	” Daisy tosses herself sideways into one of the low sea blue chairs and drapes her bare , curvy legs over the armrest , which is shaped like a dolphin too , and reaches over her head to deposit the drink on the floor behind her . Sweet Jesus , she ’s flexible . Another noise has me whipping my head back toward Imogen , and this time , I do n’t miss the people behind her . A tall , salt - and - pepper - haired man in a suit carrying Imogen ’s ivory purse . A brick shithouse with dark blond hair and a scowl who looks like a bodyguard . And Stanley Chihuahua , who ’s now carrying a baby carrier that ’s the source of the noise . “
8899	8903	8904	8904	Alessandro	2859	” Daisy asks . “
8938	8939	8943	8943	she	612	” “
8945	8967	8968	8968	She	612	” Imogen asks the bodyguard who is n’t moving to get the older woman a drink . Alessandro , I assume . “
8972	8973	8968	8968	She	612	” “
8979	8980	8974	8974	You	612	” “
8983	9115	8974	8974	You	612	” Daisy winks at me , like we ’re sharing a secret , except I do n’t know if it ’s that she ’s actually drunk and her bodyguard is lying , or that she ’s sober and just trying to get her grandmother ’s goat . But I do n’t give two fucks about Daisy and goats . I give two fucks about the kid in the carrier . He ’s young . Super young . So little , his legs do n’t reach the edge of the carrier , and he has little control over his hands as he waves them about , crying his lungs out . Another lightheaded feeling washes over me as I realize who he is . He has to be , does n’t he ? “
9135	9157	9158	9158	Everyone	403	” Imogen scowls at Daisy , who rolls her eyes , grabs her drink , and sips off it upside down . “
9165	9227	9158	9158	Everyone	403	” None of the adults move to comfort the baby . The crying orphan . Do n’t do it , Marine ! my nut sack barks . Retreat ! Retreat ! For being ignorant , randy suckers , they know me damn well . Stanley Chihuahua grimaces at the carrier , puts it down , and steps a few feet away . “
9233	9447	9158	9158	Everyone	403	” I interrupt as Daisy and her grandmother bicker . They ignore me . The baby wails harder . And something deep in my heart twists . I take three strides to the carrier and squat . No one tries to stop me , which pisses me off even more . I ’m a fucking stranger . Unbuckling a baby . If there were strangers in my sisters ’ houses doing what I ’m doing right now , I ’d tackle the fuckers first and ask questions later . There ’s an issue with Julienne Carter - Roderick ’s will . I need you to come with me . It ’s personal . I ’m starting to get a very , very bad feeling . The baby ’s still so tiny I have to cradle his head as I put him to my shoulder — next to my bad ear — and stand and bounce . Imogen spears me a glance . Her lips pinch , but she does n’t tell me to unhand the kid . Not that I would . Who would I hand him to ? She ’s clearly not a baby person , or she ’d be comforting him herself . Her lawyer and her purse carrier dude too . “
9454	9618	9158	9158	Everyone	403	” I press again while the little guy snuggles in deeper and his sobs slow . Imogen ignores me . These people are total assholes when it comes to answering questions . But this baby is not . He smells like spit - up and pee , and he ’s so tiny my hand covers his entire back . His black hair is slick , like he ’s been sweating , and his tears are dripping onto my neck . I ’m the oldest of six . I have twelve nieces and nephews . I signed up for the Marines to take care of people . This baby ? This baby needs someone to take care of him , and having him curl into me is sparking every protective instinct in my entire being . None of them brought so much as a diaper bag , though , so I clearly ca n’t take care of him any more than just holding him . “
9624	9640	9641	9641	Gramsies	139	” Imogen orders Daisy , who lifts a lazy brow that ’s also neon red . “
9655	9656	9653	9653	mine	619	” “
9677	9718	9670	9672	Remington Nathaniel Roderick	86	” Daisy blinks at her grandmother , then turns her lavender eyes to the lawyer , then me , then back to her grandmother . While my hands tighten around the baby — is she fucking kidding?—Daisy busts out laughing . “
9725	9726	9670	9672	Remington Nathaniel Roderick	86	” “
9733	9743	9727	9727	I	2293	” Imogen Carter turns that glacial glare on me . “
9757	9784	9747	9747	Julienne	408	” I tilt my good ear toward her as my grip tightens even harder around the baby while my stomach goes bungee jumping to my toes . “
9788	9789	9790	9790	I	2293	” “
9818	10431	10432	10433	Mr. Jaeger	104	” Holy fuck . My nuts are too in shock to offer up any commentary . There ’s a buzz in my ears — the good and the bad one — and I go momentarily light - headed while I , too , sink into a dolphin chair with the baby . I ’m definitely not here for a party . Four Daisy This is not happening . Except it is , and I need to call my support staff immediately to get plans put in motion . Nannies . Trust funds . Roller coasters that need to be added to the neighborhood . Fuck . A baby ? We ’re in my office while my security team slowly kills the party , since word reached us that Anthony Roderick tried to sneak into the Bluewater enclave — undoubtedly looking for the baby , which he probably sees as property , since he ’s that kind of ass — and it ’s safer in my office than in the pool house because I have a tighter alarm system in here . I should ping Cameron , Emily , and Luna — my three vagillionaire besties who live down the street in their own mansions with their boyfriends and fiancés — and let them know we might have a slight security situation brewing , except Luna and Beck ’s dog next door will bark if she feels the slightest bit of danger . Brutus , the community ’s free - range St. Bernard , would also bark if he saw anything suspicious , though who knows where Brutus is right now ? Hell , Steve the Alligator would probably bark at the Rodericks too . Steve can sense evil . I ’m sure of it . But on an actually - likely - to - happen note , Cam ’s fiancé , Jude , is basically always on high alert after the little security ordeal that brought him into her life . He notices even when the sea turtles change direction . And I suspect it bothers the shit out of him when I throw parties after everything Cam went through when they met , but generally , all I get is a text message . You ’re not being stupid , are you ? Huh . Why has n’t he texted yet ? Or Cam ? Oh . Right . Because they ’re probably having wild monkey sex . Emily and Derek are probably having monkey sex too . Actually , add Luna and Big Dick Beck to the monkey sex list as well . I sigh , because I will most likely not be having wild monkey sex again anytime soon . All I ’ll have is a memory of a striptease from the hot as fuck stranger who probably would n’t be here if Gramalicious had n’t vetted him already , and who probably wo n’t be here long , because who stays to take care of a stranger ’s baby ? He ’s feeding the baby right now . And he changed a diaper after Pierson , The Dame ’s butler , produced a bag of supplies , but staying ? For the next eighteen years ? No way . People do n’t do that . But not only is he holding and feeding the baby , he ’s also engaged in the stare war to end all stare wars with my grandmother . Usually challenging her only makes her paranormal undead powers stronger , but it seems that being challenged might also be strengthening him . Whoa . Just whoa . I said sexy as fuck , right ? “
10452	10472	10435	10437	my legal team	626	” my grandmother says . I need a paper bag . And that ’s before he growls a low , “
10475	10552	10435	10437	my legal team	626	” at her . She frowns and glowers , which is impressive . Usually I ’m the only one who can overcome the power of her Botox , but unlike me , Westley Jaeger has n’t made her a few billion dollars — I’m equally fucked the day my grandmother realizes I ’m more lucky than brilliant , because I do love poking her — so he ’s really taking his life into his own hands . “
10575	10581	10435	10437	my legal team	626	” The Dame says dryly . “
10605	10621	10601	10603	Sea Stars Anonymous	629	” He stares blankly at her while I simultaneously try not to laugh and cry . “
10628	10637	10640	10640	Daisy	155	” I ask . Her face pinches again . “
10648	10649	10640	10640	Daisy	155	” “
10679	10684	10685	10685	I	2293	” I tell West . “
10698	10699	10685	10685	I	2293	” “
10728	10795	10796	10796	Lady	632	” I suck in a breath and step back , bumping into one of my frozen yogurt dispensers and accidentally making it leak down my back . But that face — the raw anger emanating from his blazing hot honey brown eyes — the way his nostrils flare , the way he bares his teeth — hot as fuck may not be a strong enough sentiment . “
10895	10940	10892	10892	We	640	” I need a fresh pair of panties . And also to realize I should probably be offended by Party McDiamonds , but I ’m secretly very impressed with the nickname . It ’s a new one . The Dame squares off against him . “
10958	10959	10960	10960	I	2293	” “
11025	11143	11019	11019	I	2293	” He ’s cradling the tiny bundle against his dark blue polo with one thick , corded forearm while a fire rages in his dark eyes , and is it possible for ovaries to melt ? Because my mouth is dry and my knees are weak and I just had a flash of something that has nothing to do with my erogenous zones and everything to do with some deeper level of arousal than I ’ve ever felt before . Men with babies . Men who tell off my grandmother with babies . This is better than weekends in Bali with rock stars . Oh , god . My biological clock just gonged . Fuck . Fuck . “
11149	11179	11180	11181	The nanny	408	” I ask . I ’m breathless and desperate , and I need to latch onto something solid and familiar . Westley snorts like that ’s an inappropriate question . “
11196	11202	11180	11181	The nanny	408	” The Dame informs me . “
11230	11231	11222	11222	she	408	” “
11245	11282	11222	11222	she	408	” Belatedly , I realize she has n’t started shapeshifting into a bull to ram a horn up West Jaeger ’s ass over his insolence . But before I can dwell on it , she adds , “
11296	11492	11222	11222	she	408	” I suck in a sharp breath , because no , she did n’t . Except she did . She just threatened to disinherit me if I do n’t raise Julienne ’s baby . This whole inheriting - a - baby thing might have me teetering on the edge of a major fissure while an earthquake still rocks around me , but I ’m not an asshole concerned about getting a couple hundred million bucks when The Dame kicks the bucket . It ’s more that being disinherited means being fired from Carter International Properties . It means failing . I spent the first twenty - one years of my life being underestimated to the point that I did n’t believe in myself . I need this job . I actually do n’t suck at it , and while I know my success is more because I have the Carter family name behind me than because I ’m actually good at negotiating with people , she has n’t fired me yet . Helping run a real estate empire ? I can do that . Raising Julienne ’s baby ? I. Am . So . Fucked . “
11524	11543	11546	11546	she	153	” Westley offers . I straighten and shiver as a glop of frozen yogurt slides down my ass . “
11560	11844	11551	11551	I	2293	” He lifts a brow , then looks down at his arms , at the bundle of sleeping baby with a little milk dribbling out the corner of his mouth . The utterly innocent bundle of orphan that I have n’t touched yet , even though realizing he ’s completely alone in the world makes me want to smother him in my arms and hug him tight and promise him he ’ll be okay . Oh my god . I do n’t know if Julienne ever hugged him . No wonder he ’s so comfortable in a stranger ’s arms . He just needs to be loved . That is all babies need , is n’t it ? Or is it ? Fuck . I do n’t know the first thing about babies . Fuckaroni . I need Westley . I need him to teach me how to hold a baby and how to know when Remy ’s hungry and how to put him to sleep . Yes , Remy , because he ’s so tiny and innocent and a cute little name just fits him better . Oh , double fuck with cheese and bacon on top . I really am having maternal urges . And ridiculous notions about dark - eyed , overprotective strangers . I have a full staff who runs my house , and I ’m positive any of them could teach me the same things this man holding the baby right now can . Except those maternal urges to kiss Remy ’s little cheeks are getting mixed up with the hello , hot single dad vibes thumping in my ovaries , which I do not appreciate . Mostly . “
11875	11896	11863	11863	I	2293	” I smile , but holy fucking shit , how the hell am I going to do this mothering thing ? “
11901	12011	11897	11897	I	2293	” I most definitely do not got this . But I have to get my grandmother out of here before she catches on to how closely I might be veering into panic territory . Imogen Carter , The Dame of the Carter family , knows things . And she ’s scowling at me like my position at Carter International Properties is n’t the only thing in danger . But it ’s the one thing she can take away that I care about . I ca n’t lose my job . I ca n’t . My job is the only thing that I ’ve ever been successful at that matters . “
12014	12018	11897	11897	I	2293	” I repeat . “
12033	12038	12023	12023	Bond	156	” she orders me . “
12045	12536	12039	12040	Mr. Jaeger	104	” While my grandmother leaves , Westley turns away from me , but not all the way , and I catch the big bad construction guy ’s face softening into a gentle smile . Swoon . No . No . Not swoon . Swoon is only for foreign hotties who believe me when I say my name is Melanie and that I get mistaken for Daisy Carter - Kincaid all the time . For men who know I ’m a one - time deal . For men who ca n’t just drive down to Miami , and yes , there was that one who just drove down to Miami from California a few years back , so no , I do n’t date Canadian or Mexican men either . All of North America is out . My security team agreed it was a good idea . I knew when I found West in the pool house that he was n’t a stripper , but I also knew that whoever he was , he was there because The Dame had ordered him to be , much like she ’d had my security team find me and inform me she was headed over and needed to talk . And I knew it would irritate the shit out of her to walk in on me making out with whoever he was . And now I have to pay for my sins . So , so much . Five West It ’s late . My head hurts the way it normally does after an adrenaline crash . There ’s something orange dripping behind Daisy all over her marble floor and killing my curiosity about the wall of frozen yogurt in this bright , airy office — which I assume is her office because of the frozen yogurt wall and the distressed white desk at one end — and I do n’t have a fucking clue where this baby needs to sleep tonight . Me ? I ’ll be on the floor . Right next to him . For tonight , at least , while my temper cools and my injured pride heals . Nothing like being kicked with a dangled insta - family that ’ll be taken away soon enough by those lawyers Imogen Carter was talking about . But this little guy has bigger problems than my temper and pride . He ’s a fucking orphan . Without a bed . Probably have to sleep on — christ . That round pink Persian - inspired rug in the center of the floor has a circle of penises woven into it . And the sunken white leather seating area around an indoor gas fireplace at the other end of the room has curved end tables decorated with jade stick figures doing each other in the butt . My balls whimper . Tonight could ’ve gone soooo differently . Are we sure all ’s lost ? “
12545	12566	12539	12539	You	655	” Daisy says with an easy , friendly , trust me smile that puts an ache back in my shoulders . “
12569	12574	12575	12575	We	657	” I answer curtly . “
12581	12625	12575	12575	We	657	” I scowl . She sighs , grabs a handful of napkins from a dispenser , and turns in a circle while she tries to wipe the orange frozen yogurt off the white and gold sparkle dress holding her tight , round ass . “
12659	12707	12709	12710	the kid	2286	” I know how this ends . They have more money and access to better lawyers than I ever will . This kid is n’t my insta - family , and my rapidly cooling temper is making me regret that ballsy move in telling off her grandmother . “
12732	12733	12734	12734	You	408	” “
12759	12808	12734	12734	You	408	” I give a single nod , because I have no idea if it ’s actually normal for rich people to think taking out a fucking exterior wall — and raising a ceiling eight inches — in four days with a crew of two is no big deal . “
12856	12857	12858	12859	My brother	541	” “
12861	12868	12858	12859	My brother	541	” Her brows pull together briefly . “
12892	12893	12888	12890	that buzzer beater	665	” “
12898	12899	12894	12894	You	408	” “
12915	12916	12909	12909	Tyler	598	” “
12945	12951	12924	12924	she	82	” She rolls her eyes . “
12966	12967	12959	12959	Julienne	408	” “
12971	13156	12959	12959	Julienne	408	” I should put the baby down , but I do n’t want to . He ’s a tiny little thing . Ca n’t be more than twelve , maybe fifteen pounds . My parents ’ cat is bigger than this child . More loved too . Not a single other person has tried to take him from me . Daisy ’s face is morphing as I bounce in place with the sleeping baby , and I do n’t like it . It ’s not lust exactly , but it ’s not not lust either . It ’s dark - eyed , heavy - lidded interest warring with body language that says stay back , danger , danger , and this is n’t the first time that look has taken over her face tonight . If life has taught me anything in twenty - plus years of dating , and then reinforced it tonight , it ’s that dating single mothers does n’t work . Time might heal all wounds , but the one poking me tonight needs more than six years , apparently . “
13166	13171	12959	12959	Julienne	408	” I ask Daisy . “
13202	13208	13184	13184	she	408	” I lift a brow . “
13257	13273	13250	13250	she	380	” My eyeball is twitching . If she keeps talking , it might never stop . “
13286	13287	13250	13250	she	380	” “
13296	13358	13290	13290	she	380	” She flashes a billion - dollar smile again , but I ’m well aware that Imogen Carter just put a fuck - ton on her shoulders . The Carter family matriarch does n’t strike me as the type to trust anyone else to fill her lawn mower with gas , much less raise a child she has vested interest in . “
13391	13392	13373	13376	Daisy Carter - Kincaid	155	” “
13418	13419	13397	13397	Google	164	” “
13439	13440	13441	13441	You	676	” “
13472	13473	13475	13475	she	380	” “
13488	13492	13475	13475	she	380	” She winces . “
13548	13549	13551	13551	you	676	” “
13553	13554	13555	13555	Westley	104	” “
13557	13561	13555	13555	Westley	104	” She winks . “
13590	13645	13581	13581	I	2293	” In other words , no . Possibly with a side of , this is a conversation for not tonight . Am I going to raise this kid ? No . But am I going to leave him with someone who does n’t have a fucking clue what she ’s doing ? Also no . “
13652	13664	13647	13647	you	676	” I ask . Her whole face transforms into pure joy . “
13693	13731	13682	13683	Baby crib	165	” This is going to be the longest night in the history of long nights , and I once pulled a forty - eight - hour shift in the desert kicking in doors looking for a terrorist . “
13735	13739	13682	13683	Baby crib	165	” I ask . “
13743	13775	13682	13683	Baby crib	165	” She tosses the dirty napkins into a trash hole in the white wall , then bites her lip while her darkening gaze travels down the length of my body again . “
13780	13805	13682	13683	Baby crib	165	” I growl . She does n’t flinch , which is probably a testament to how often she and her grandmother go at it . “
13833	13834	13826	13826	he	684	” “
13838	13839	13826	13826	he	684	” “
13860	13861	13862	13862	He	684	” “

13891	13905	13887	13887	I	2293	” She eyeballs the baby . Then lifts her eyes to me again . “
14023	14024	13996	13996	she	380	” “
14038	14047	14050	14050	Westley	104	” She tips her head back and laughs . “
14112	14113	14157	14157	you	689	” “
14116	14117	14157	14157	you	689	” “
14120	14121	14122	14122	I	2293	” “
14128	14149	14122	14122	I	2293	” Her lips part like she ’s about to argue , but to my surprise , instead , she nods . “
14161	15888	14122	14122	I	2293	” I study her . She stares right back . And I have the oddest sensation that she ’s more grateful than she ’ll admit . Retreat ! Retreat ! my nuts shout . Because they know . They ’ve seen this before . Lady with a baby having a breakdown . I tell my balls to knock it off . I ’m older . I ’m wiser . And I ’m not falling for a hard - partying heiress just because she inherited an orphan who ’s going to need all the love he can get . Yep . That ’s my story . And if I repeat it enough , I might actually convince myself it ’s true . Six Daisy I get West and Remy settled in the sitting room off my bedroom — hello , temptation — and then retreat . I ca n’t fully explain it , but I trust him . Or possibly I ’m just so relieved that I do n’t have to dive into this guardianship thing alone just yet , that I want to believe I can trust him . Either way , my life as I knew it four hours ago is basically over , and I need to adapt . Fast . I climb into bed with my laptop , and send a slew of emails to my staff , both at Carter International Properties and at home , about my schedule suddenly needing to be flexible for a little bit , all while listening to the muted sounds of West settling onto the couch in the room next door . He ’s fascinating . And by fascinating , I mean all of my erogenous zones are pinging just from having him in my personal space . I want to know why he always tilts his left ear toward me when I ’m talking . If he ’s a whiskey or a beer kind of guy . Or both . If his overprotective papa bear mode is just an adrenaline thing , or if there ’s more to his story . If he ’ll still be here in the morning . Why he ’s in Miami when his family is in Chicago — yes , fine , I googled his brother when I was supposed to be working , but who could resist ? The guy ’s basically playing hero tonight while I ’m hiding in here trying not to hyperventilate at the idea of sudden motherhood . And that whole hero thing — I do n’t trust that either . Are people really that pure - intentioned ? Although , I do n’t have to wonder why I ’m having erotic thoughts about him rubbing froyo all over my breasts . That part ’s pretty obvious . He ’s six feet of overprotective muscle with a chiseled jaw shaded by dark stubble and a hint of a tattoo peeking out from beneath one of his sleeves . The guy could be on the cover of a romance novel . I toss my laptop to the side and tiptoe to the door to the next room to peek in . It takes a minute for my eyes to adjust enough to see that the baby ’s swaddled in a blanket and snoring softly on the floor , West just a few feet from him , long body stretched out , one arm under his head , his breath slow and even . I do n’t actually believe he ’s sleeping . Even with the light so dim , I swear I can tell that he ’s too tense to be sleeping . And he ’s positioned himself between Remy and the door to the hallway , so if anyone tries to come in in the middle of the night , they ’ll trip over him first . Seriously . What kind of guy would do this ? Stay with a baby that is n’t his , but still needs him ? I shake my head and chalk it all up to utter weirdness that ’ll make more sense in the morning , pull the door mostly shut , and head back to bed , stripping out of my shirt and panties . Why have nice bedding if you ca n’t rub your whole body against it ? And then I slide under my soft , satiny sheets and flip off my light . I ’m mildly horny . And I need to take the edge off . A nice fantasy about Julio should do . He ’s a delectable beach bum I spent a night with in the Canary Islands a few months ago . He also thinks my name is Sandi with an I , and he had quite the dirty - talking tongue on him . I let myself imagine we ’d met on a cobblestone road in Tuscany after highwaymen made off with my carriage and escort , leaving me naked and alone and vulnerable . He ’d whip off his shirt and wrap it about me , surrounding me with the scent of sun - dried cotton and salty seas , then heft me into his chiseled arms and carry me to the nearest tavern , where he ’d spoon - feed me broth and murmur low in Italian about how he ’ll avenge my honor , and keep me safe until such a day as he ’s run his dagger through the hearts of every highwayman in Europe . Possibly I ’ve been reading too many historical romances . But it ’s working . My skin burns against my sheets , and I part my legs while I tease my nipples into hard nubs , ignoring the little detail in my fantasy that instead of a lean surfer ’s body with sun - kissed brown hair , all I can see is a thick - necked , dark - scruffed , brown - eyed warrior in a leather kilt . My fingers drift over my breasts and down my soft belly as I smile and stifle a whimper . My pussy ’s aching . My clit is tingling . And I ’m fantasizing about Westley Jaeger in gladiator gear , charging a raging bull trying to trample a baby , and holy fuck , why are men with babies so fucking hot ? I flick my clit to distract myself from remembering him pulling his shirt up , giving me a glimpse at a tattoo . At him staring my grandmother down like a warrior . At him bouncing Remy . My head tilts back and I have to squeeze my lips tight together to keep from moaning . I wonder if he ’s as good with his hands on a woman ’s body as he is with a baby . No . No , Daisy . Too close . He ’s off - limits . For so many reasons . God , off - limits is hot . I want off - limits . I want to be bad . I want — A high - pitched wail suddenly erupts in the next room , and I yank my hand out of my chacha and fly off the bed . I fling the door open to the sitting room , remember I ’m naked as West looks up at me , and I screech . He screeches . Remy wails . And I dive for cover under my vanity . I ’m good with nudity . My body ’s never going to earn me a strut down the catwalk during Fashion Week , but I know how to use it to maximum advantage . Plus , I have these tits that just wo n’t stop . Also , it ’s flipping dark . No way he actually saw me . So I do n’t know why I ’m shrieking and hiding . Okay , that ’s a lie . I totally know why I ’m shrieking and hiding . My grandmother would kill me if I tried to seduce West , which is actually the least of my concerns . I do a lot of things she ’d kill me for — I’m very good at walking that line between making her angry and making her head explode like a volcano before it reforms into a meaner version than before — but I make her enough money that she overlooks it . Mostly . We both know I only make her a lot of money because people know if they do n’t deal with me , they ’ll deal with her . Without her name behind me , I ’d need to get a door - to - door salesman mustache and the brown leather briefcase holding vacation timeshare brochures to make enough money to put food on my table . And I do n’t mean food on the crystal Aisu table in my under - the - sea lounge downstairs either . I mean a wobbly Formica table that I pulled out of the trash after I get evicted from my fabulous D - shaped hacienda . Fucking up Julienne ’s kid ’s life would never be overlookable to The Dame . Plus , West lives within driving distance of my house — obviously — and he knows my real name , which by default marks him off my list of people I ’d like to sleep with . If co - inheriting my cousin ’s baby with him is complicated , getting physically involved would be catastrophic . Sleeping with Westley Jaeger is completely and totally off the table . All the tables . There will be no nookie on the Aisu table or any of the other tables in this house . Or anywhere in Bluewater . So being naked around him probably should be too . And it ’s more expeditious to pretend I ’m embarrassed to be naked than it is to stand there and tempt him with my goddessness while I tell him that we ’re not happening . Yep . That ’s my logic . I drop my head to the floor and stifle a groan , and this one is definitely not a good groan . He knocks at the door . “
15922	16031	15914	15914	I	2293	” I scoot deeper under the vanity , which would be easier if I did n’t have these melons on my chest getting in the way , and if I ’d eaten a little less pasta the last four times I was in Italy this year . And gelato . I definitely should ’ve eaten less — no , never mind . I definitely should ’ve eaten more gelato , because you only live once , and it ’s Italian gelato , and it ’s well worth the extra padding on my ass . I should have some gelato delivered tomorrow . Apparently along with a rocking chair . “
16046	16061	15914	15914	I	2293	” I call back . He mutters something under his breath . Remy wails . “
16065	16159	15914	15914	I	2293	” he says . I almost offer to take Remy , but I ’ve never actually held a baby before . I ’ve squealed over plenty . Made googoo eyes and baby - talked and booped their little noses and kissed their little heads . But I have n’t held a baby . I need to . Soon . But as long as West ’s here , I do n’t have to , and so I ’m putting it off until I ’m well - rested . Yep . That ’s my story . “
16163	16312	16313	16313	He	704	” I call to him . Maybe I ca n’t hold a baby , but I can work miracles . Seven Daisy Friday morning , I ’m yanked out of a dream by a loud , weird wailing in my ear . I ’m disoriented and tangled in a sheet of doom that I apparently twisted myself into overnight , and as the remnants of the dream evaporate , I realize I ’m not alone . I try to bolt upright , almost fall off the bed , and stick my head straight into the crotch of a tall , burly man who smells like baby powder and coffee . There ’s a man . Standing beside the gauzy curtains of my four - poster bed in my dollhouse bedroom . And he ’s holding out a crying baby . Oh , fuck . I have a baby . “
16323	16337	16313	16313	He	704	” the tree trunk announces over the sound of the baby ’s cries . “
16382	16400	16375	16375	I	2293	” I blink away the crustiness in my eyes and try to make him come into focus . “
16405	16406	16407	16407	Nobody	532	” “
16419	16487	16488	16488	You’re	120	” Nobody important . Not likely . I know exactly who he is , and that dream that evaporated comes flying back into my head like a runaway locomotive . Which is eerily symbolic of everything that was just going down in my dreams , which West was unfortunately starring in , this time in a train conductor uniform , which was sexier than you might think . “
16492	16496	16497	16497	He	704	” He sighs . “
16535	16551	16552	16552	I	2293	” Panic swells under my breastbone and flops around like a grouper in the sand . “
16560	16564	16558	16558	babies	2324	” I blurt . “
16570	16571	16565	16565	You	705	” “
16595	16655	16583	16583	I	2293	” It ’s the rich kid version of street smarts . Do n’t hire anyone you have n’t vetted , and make everyone sign an NDA . Oh , fuck . I did n’t ask West to sign an NDA . I wonder if the Graminator did . Probably . I bat my eyelashes . He rolls his eyes . “
16664	16665	16669	16669	you	2293	” “
16671	16672	16666	16666	I	2293	” “
16679	17038	16666	16666	I	2293	” The clock hands on the ivory wall across from my bed tell me it ’s almost eight AM . Our little incident happened around three AM . I had him a rocking chair by three - fifteen — and I owe my housekeeper a case of strawberry Pocky to thank her for that , since it ’s Lucinda ’s favorite treat ever . However , I do n’t think I ’ll be thanking anyone for the fantasy fuel that was listening to West sing Remy lullabies until around four . He ’s cradling the baby one - armed and wearing the same clothes he arrived in — jeans and a blue polo — but his beard seems thicker and his eyes — which I swore were honey - brown last night but are now a deep - set green under his thick brows — are definitely more world - weary . He works construction . Without air conditioning . Swinging a hammer in the Miami sun , wiping sweat off his forehead , bare - chested , and tipping his head back to enjoy a Diet Coke while the office ladies across the street gawk , and god , if I ’m having bare - chested fantasies of a man holding a baby before coffee , then this co - parenting thing is an awful idea . That ’s probably why Julienne did it . Because she thought it would be hilarious to imagine me raising an infant with a retired Marine with the body of a god and the soul of a saint and the sense of humor of — well . I ’m not sure I ’ve seen his sense of humor yet . Unless this is it . You ’re up , Daisy . I ’m going to stand here and laugh my ass off while you try to figure out how to change a diaper . My phone rings somewhere amidst all the fluffy covers — my grandmother ’s ring tone , that Half - Cocked Heroes song about the devil calling — and Remy bursts into a harder wail . West smirks . “
17048	17049	17050	17050	Daisy	1365	” “
17078	17758	17073	17073	We	716	” I double - check that I ’m not naked and mentally high - five myself when I realize I ’m wearing my oversize Sober is a Four - Letter Word T - shirt . Present from Emily last Christmas . I love my friends . They get me . And since I ’m decent , I throw the covers back , find my phone and silence it , and then peek over at Remy , ignoring that tempting scent of coffee lingering on the man holding the baby . The baby . Oh , the baby . His skin is so smooth and soft - looking , his eyes mildly panicked like he knows his mama ’s gone , and his little hands are waving about like he ’s trying to grasp onto something but does n’t know how . And I want to love him . I want to love him and promise him he ’ll be fine and that I know what I ’m doing , except I ca n’t . Who gives me a fucking baby ? West slowly transfers the infant to me , the back of his hand brushing the top of my arm and making me shiver , but he does n’t stop . It ’s like he has no idea that the mere thought of holding Remy is making me both freak out and go all twitterpated . What if I drop him ? What if he ’s allergic to my soap ? What if he thinks my boobs have milk in them ? I sink back down onto my bed as the squirmy little human flings a dimpled hand at me . He ’s light as a feather and seven gazillion times more fragile . But as soon as I have a firm grip on him , holding his sweaty little body against my breast , I start bouncing and whispering shh like it ’s the most natural thing in the world . And he stops fussing . Stops crying . Just snuggles in , a little bundle of pure innocence that has chosen me . My breath catches , and I stare down so West ca n’t see my face . Babies ? So not in my life plan . I work hard so I can play hard . Make a deal in Madrid , then head to the Canary Islands for a wild three - day fling with a Spaniard . Start talks in Rio , then dash down to Antarctica for a South Pole polar plunge on a dare that costs some actor or Greek shipping magnate a hefty donation to charity and ends with a big , burly Viking warming me up in bed . Coming home to the husband and three - point - two minions ? My genes are n’t really built for the whole solid family thing . I used to think it was the money , except it ’s not . Money ’s a symptom . Not the root cause . We ’re a judgmental lot of assholes . Performance determines worth . And I never wanted a child to feel like an accomplishment . Feel accomplished , yes . Be someone else ’s accomplishment — like I am to my father — no . And much as I love my mom , she , too , puts her self - worth directly in line with how well her art sells . But holding this baby while he snuggles in close ? It ’s making me feel weird protective things that I was never supposed to feel but ca n’t stop . Like I would move the entire fucking earth to keep him happy . I wonder if Julienne felt those things about him , or if she was as screwed up as the rest of us ? West is watching me , something both soft and protective as hell flashing over his features , and my nipples pebble and remind me that I ’m not wearing a bra under this shirt . “
17767	17778	17779	17779	People	2202	” I say quietly , my gaze darting down again . “
17784	17827	17779	17779	People	2202	” It ’s a simple sentiment , but it gives me more horny shivers in the vajayjay . My emotions are a wreck right now . I do n’t like wrecked emotions , so I tell them to shape the fuck up . “
17849	17996	17842	17842	Remy	1365	” I hope . Even if I figure out how to take care of a baby , there ’s still the Rodericks to deal with . They ’ll undoubtedly challenge the will , which is dumb , because I do n’t think either of them cares about anything beyond money and stature . Anthony Roderick would probably sell his wife for a million bucks and controlling share in a whiskey distillery , and Margot Roderick honestly believes neither her husband nor her son could do any wrong , when they ’re both what my mother would call philandering assholes . Just thinking about them makes me want to buy out six florists today and make sure everyone all across Little Havana gets a free flower . It ’s how I get balance from the ugly parts of my life — by spreading love bombs across Miami . “
18004	18021	17997	17997	You	719	” West says gruffly . Of fucking course I am . But I smile at him . “
18026	18177	17997	17997	You	719	” I press a kiss to Remy ’s head because I need to look away from the man whose temper is rising so fast that he ’s making me sweat — who knew I was a sucker for the overprotective type?—and oh my god . This baby . He ’s so sweet . He ’s cuddling closer and closer , smelling like peach fuzz and baby sweat , which should n’t be addictive to sniff , except it is . And his hair — he has this thick black hair that ’s so fine and soft , it could probably be sold on the black market for a special new kind of cashmere . Not that I ’d do that to him . But I know enough unscrupulous people who would . My door bangs open . West spins into a crouch , flinging himself between me and my visitors . “
18180	18258	18259	18260	Your grandmother	84	” he orders Alessandro , who crosses his arms and lifts a brow . I should be trying not to grin right now , but West just basically put his life on the line in issuing orders to my head of security without looking first . Except having someone who ’s not paid to protect me put himself in the line of fire is volcanic on the hotness scale , and there ’s nothing funny about that . “
18266	18281	18282	18282	You	720	” Alessandro tells me . He eyeballs West . West eyeballs him right back . “
18285	18289	18292	18292	my	2293	” Alessandro demands . “
18298	18400	18292	18292	my	2293	” The two men continue to stare at each other , and something passes silently between them . I do n’t know what , but I know Alessandro is a better judge of character than any dog , and even Luna ’s Beck , who spends his whole life around dogs , agrees . So when my head of security nods to West and holds out a fist for a bump , a puddle of warmth floods my chest . A puddle of warmth that means absolutely nothing , because in the next breath , West is walking out the door . “
18407	18444	18292	18292	my	2293	” I call after him , making Remy squawk at the sudden noise . He turns , and I catch the weirdest expression on his face . Like … hope ? Or dread ? Or both ? “
18448	18472	18446	18446	attorneys	722	” I wave a hand , realize I do n’t want to take that hand off Remy , and quickly put it back . “
18479	18480	18446	18446	attorneys	722	” “
18485	18819	18821	18821	she	724	” Alessandro says to me . And then West is gone . And I have this horrible suspicion I ’m never going to see him again , which should n’t be a bad thing — we ca n’t date , for multiple reasons , and having him out of the way so no one is witness to me fucking up Remy is a good thing . But I still feel the weirdest emptiness , an extra loneliness , at my temporary co - guardian doing exactly what my family wants him to do . Leave . It ’s right , but it ’s also so , so wrong . Eight West I do n’t want to leave Daisy alone with Remy , because she has the same look on her face that Tyler had the day our first niece was born — the one that says oh my god I have no idea what I ’m doing holding this thing that ’s smaller than a football . But that baby is hers so much more than he can ever be mine . I have no blood claim . I did n’t know his family . And it ’s not like I ’m leaving him stranded at the steps of a firehouse and hoping he ’ll get adopted someday by a family who loves him . This family has money . They have their own brand of loyalty . And it ’s none of my fucking business . Alessandro walks me down a winding staircase , out through the D - shaped courtyard and past a D - shaped pool , and into a sitting room with another round sunken seating area with a gas fire pit in the middle , crystal penises decorating the end tables , and bright green plants placed about the room beneath the high ceiling . We walk through this room too , straight into a connected foyer with a curved glass staircase . I pause at the doorway . “
18828	18853	18821	18821	she	724	” He studies me briefly , and I know he ’s not going to answer me . So it surprises me when he replies , “
18861	18871	18858	18858	She	724	” That ’s not ominous . Not at all . “
18882	18883	18858	18858	She	724	” “
18890	18891	18858	18858	She	724	” “
18896	18897	18894	18894	Julienne	408	” “
18900	18901	18902	18902	She	724	” “
18911	18912	18902	18902	She	724	” “
18921	19060	19061	19062	The Rodericks	93	” I look down at the textured white marble floor . All I need is one person to stand up and tell me this kid ’s parents had a solid reason for putting me in that will , and I ’d stay . I ’d fight . I could give him doting aunts . The best grandparents . An insane uncle — everyone needs an Uncle Tyler — and cousins and pool parties and root beer popsicles and birthday parties and lawn darts and a solid middle - class life full of fun and hard work . But staying here is nothing more than a shortcut to another family I do n’t belong with . Easier to walk away now than to stay , get attached , and complicate what ’s undoubtedly going to be a messy situation . “
19070	19180	19181	19181	They	726	” I met Anthony Roderick once . Guy leered at his daughter - in - law like he wanted to take her to bed himself , slapped the housekeeper on the ass , and pissed in the bushes . Not in that order . I ’d probably be in jail if I ’d been any closer when the ass - slapping happened , but he was long gone by the time I made it out of the nursery . My Spanish was n’t good enough to understand the maid , but I knew the hand gesture . Leave it be . It ’s fine . It was n’t fine . “
19185	19190	19181	19181	They	726	” Alessandro tells me . “
19199	19231	19195	19195	We	726	” We know people . See ? The baby has Alessandro too . He does n’t need me . He ’ll never even remember me . I hand him my card . “
19242	19301	19195	19195	We	726	” He studies me again , and I get the feeling he ’s calling me a pansy - ass for leaving . Or possibly an idiot for thinking I could have anything Daisy Carter - Kincaid might need . He opens the door , and a parrot squawks an obscenity at us from a perch near a window . “
19309	19325	19307	19307	Frank	175	” Alessandro says . The parrot tells him to fuck off , then flutters away . “
19340	19373	19326	19326	We	729	” he tells me . I nod and head for my truck , parked in the same place I put it last night . Or fifty years ago . Feels that long . “
19392	19398	19326	19326	We	729	” My head whips up . “
19401	19402	19326	19326	We	729	” “
19411	19828	19829	19829	He	730	” Fucker . He grins . I flip him off and head for my car . In all the chaos , I forgot to tell my family . My sister Keely reads TMZ religiously . I open my truck , climb in , and fire up my phone , which I shut down last night when the battery started getting low . I ’m tired , and I do n’t want to deal with this . I got approximately forty - five minutes of sleep last night in the sprawling , sea - toned sitting room where the baby fussed and whimpered through the night , with the window open to let in the sea breeze and the sound of the bay outside . Forty - five minutes of dream - filled sleep about getting summoned into that princess bedroom for a second chance at the striptease , followed by a booty call , courtesy of that flash of seeing Daisy naked at three AM . She ’s wild and unpredictable and annoying and irresponsible and fucking fascinating . And for two whole minutes , I thought we ’d have some fun . Until life happened . But life with Daisy is n’t happening now . Because I ’ve done the date a single mother thing one too many times . No way I ’m getting involved with a woman who just unexpectedly inherited a baby . No matter what watching her face light up with joy and utter adoration at holding the baby did to that hollow in my chest . My phone powers up , and a minute later , I get approximately six thousand message notifications . I scroll up , and start at the top of the family group text , and jump in apparently just in time . Keely : WESTLEY MICHAEL JAEGER , YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH ME . A BABY ? You inherited a BABY with a BILLIONAIRE HEIRESS PARTY GIRL and you let us find out from people.com ? * angry emoji * * shocked emoji * Mom : Keely , I told you , that article was about a different Westley Jaeger .

Remember ? “
19861	20929	20930	20930	I	2293	” Mom : Oh , THAT woman ? THAT was the woman who left him a BABY ? Honey . This is just Tyler setting up another prank . Allie : God , Keely , did you memorize that review ? And Tyler knows a lot of people , but even he ca n’t hack people.com to put up a prank article about West . Allie : Wait . Actually , he probably knows someone who could . Tyler , tell me you did n’t set this up . Tyler : I WISH I set it up . That ’s fucking epic . W , did someone else set this up ? Who else knows you well enough to pull off the prank of the century ? Britney : West , we know you have your hands full , but if you do n’t answer in the next two minutes , we ’re organizing a convoy and charging Daisy Carter - Kincaid ’s mansion . * sword emoji * * dragon emoji * * knight emoji * West : You ca n’t teleport from Chicago , so do n’t threaten it . Yes , I inherited the 1 - star lady ’s kid . No , I do n’t know why . Yes , with Daisy . No , you ca n’t come see the house just because you want to . Sorry I did n’t tell you — been a little busy the last twelve hours or so . Do n’t get excited — it wo n’t stick . Allie : West , I still have Liliana ’s high chair . Actually , it ’s the last baby thing I have left . Yours if you want it . I ’ll ship it , because you ’re my favorite big brother , and it ’s about time you settled down and gave Mom kids , considering how long you ’ve already made her wait . Keely : DO NOT GIVE AWAY YOUR LAST BABY ITEM OR YOU’LL GET PREGNANT AGAIN , YOU IDIOT . West , I ’ll buy you a fucking high chair . DO NOT TAKE ALLIE’S. Also , insensitive much ? HELLO , THE SIERRA YEARS . If West wants a baby , I fully support him inheriting one of his own . Britney : Not touching that Keely said the S - word , but hard agree on the high chair . Do n’t take Allie ’s . * pacifier emoji * * avocado emoji * Allie : You guys , Oscar ’s fixed . More babies are NOT a concern . And avocado ? WTF , Brit ? I do n’t know what that means . Allie : OH ! Right . Avocado . Good baby food . I got it now . Keely : * GIF of woman falling over laughing * You ’re all nuts , and DAISY CARTER - KINCAID CAN FUCKING AFFORD A HIGH CHAIR . Can we get back to the important part here ? Britney : Keely ’s right , Allie . We should talk about the important part . Has Oscar had his semen tested to make sure it ’s swimmer - free ? Not saying I know from personal experience how important that is , but * baby emoji * * baby emoji * * baby emoji * Mom : OMD , you ’re pregnant with TRIPLETS ? Allie : Mom . It ’s O - M - G.

West : Are you fuckers done ? Mom : Of course , honey . Though I am taking screenshots of all of this . I ’m working on a new set for my show . Netflix asked for a second season . Their demographic testing shows I do well with the middle - aged set , which means I need more funny family stuff . Tyler , I also need you to show me how to do that intentional autocorrect thing with your father ’s phone . Keely : And again , let ’s get back to West … * GIF of the three dudes from Three Men and a Baby * You okay , West ? F or real ? They ’re not talking about taking the baby away from you , are they ? Or would you rather not raise him ? Either way , we support you . Britney : God , yes . Let ’s talk about West AND THE REAL BABY . * baby emoji * See ? ONE BABY . ONE BABY EMOJI . Not coming from my baby making loins . * porkchop emoji * Also , ditto to Keely , West . However you want to play this , we have your back . Tyler : You need a lawyer , West ? I know a guy who knows a guy . Keely : * GIF of someone popping gum and waiting for the story * West : Yes . YES . I definitely need to talk to a lawyer . But I hope this lawyer ’s better than your last “
20939	21268	20930	20930	I	2293	” He smelled like canned baloney and only won that case because the judge got tired of his burping . Not true , but if there ’s one thing my family ’s good at , it ’s giving each other shit . And given how many guys Tyler knows in the whole hockey league who ’ve had to do paternity tests — which is somewhere between more guys than I knew in the Marines who had to do paternity tests and the number of times I ’ve already seen Daisy bounce up and down in excitement over something — I’m going to assume his lawyer contact is reasonably competent . And probably expensive . And very , very ironic . The last time I tried parenting ended spectacularly horrifically . But I had zero legal claim that time . I was just the boyfriend . Sierra did n’t want to get married — said she ’d done that once and was n’t doing it again . But when the military ordered me to move from South Carolina to California , I thought she ’d change her mind . That she ’d realize I was worth moving for . Except it turns out , she did n’t love me that much . I would ’ve stayed just for her kids at that point . But she kicked me out . Told me to eat shit and die . And then hit on my best friend . Was n’t in much of a place to be a solid father figure after that . Probably could ’ve stayed and fought for her , but at what ultimate price to her and her kids ? My phone dings , pulling me back to the present . Tyler ’s sending contact info for a local family law attorney . Almost a father once with no legal claim . Now , I have all the legal claim , but no moral reason to stay . “
21273	21279	20930	20930	I	2293	” I whisper to Daisy . “
21287	21855	21856	21857	The Rodericks	93	” I had my doubts when I got here . I had my doubts overnight . But that soft but overwhelmed smile that crept over her face when she finally took the baby and looked down at him in her arms ? That ’s not something money can buy . My gut says that kid ’s going to get the only thing I thought I could offer him . And so I tell my family I ’m bowing out — that it ’s for the best — put my truck in gear , and head back out the way I came . Past all the mansions . A golf course . Condos . Palm trees . People in colorful clothes out for jogs or walks along the golf cart trails winding along the road . A group of ladies on a patio overlooking the miniature golf course , all gossiping and holding out their pinky fingers while they sip their coffee . Glimpsing a little row of shops beyond that carved rooster near the gate . And I head back to what I ’m supposed to be doing . Getting my footing after the Marines . Fixing up an old gym . Living life on the beach . And apparently not having a family anytime soon . Nine Daisy If it was n’t for Lucinda , I would be falling apart . But she bustles in two minutes after Alessandro escorted West out of my room , like she was n’t up mere hours ago hunting down a rocking chair in the middle of the night . She holds the baby while I shower quickly , and when I ’m ready to face the day , he ’s sleeping peacefully in a large basket lined with a soft but thin pillow . And so I do what I do best — I dive into faking my way through this . I call up a personal shopper I know , explain what I need , and she assures me she ’ll have a nursery arranged before dinnertime , complete with a wardrobe to get a Miami baby through the holidays . Then it ’s on to searching for nannies , which is new territory , but I ’ve phone interviewed three nanny agencies before ten , and have in - person meetings set with the executive directors of my two favorites . My personal assistant shows up mid - morning with crates of diapers , wipes , and formula , and by the time I ’m done interviewing the two nanny services , I feel like I have everything under control . It helps that Lucinda ’s been playing babysitter . She has four grandchildren and adores babies , but also loves giving them back to their parents at the end of her days with them . Apparently it ’s the true joy of grandparenting . Or so she tells me . In any case , by the time my doorbell chimes out its trumpet blast halfway through the afternoon , I ’m on top of the world . I am rocking this guardian thing . But a few minutes later , the sour expression on my grandmother ’s face suggests she does n’t see it . She marches into my office , where I ’ve finally sat down to catch up on work emails , and announces , “

21871	21903	21856	21857	The Rodericks	93	” I glance at my dick clock — one of my mom ’s pieces of art , which hangs proudly opposite the wall of windows overlooking the beach . Three PM . “

21928	21959	21924	21924	I	2293	” My grandmother peels her reading glasses off in that way that spells doom and tilts her chin down in a way that spells you are so fucked , Daisy . “
21966	21995	21960	21960	You	735	” she informs me in that voice that offers not even a sliver of a crack to weasel in an argument . Like that ’s ever stopped me . “

22152	22207	22208	22208	I	2293	” I gape at her , because there ’s nothing else to do in this situation . My grandmother does not invite non - family people to family events . Specifically , to the raising of Carter family children . Control freak , thy name is Imogen Carter . She lifts a silver brow . “
22223	22224	22225	22225	Grandma	92	” “

22256	22288	22236	22237	The tabloids	747	” No point in arguing , because they ’ll say what they want . It ’s a fact of being covered by the gossip sites . You get used to it . “
22304	22305	22306	22307	Partial witnesses	751	” “
22309	22356	22306	22307	Partial witnesses	751	” And again with the no point in arguing . One of the luxuries of being rich is that you can get away with so , so much . Not that I do , for the record . I ’m an heiress , not a troublemaker . “
22368	22468	22469	22471	Gram - gram	161	” She sniffs like I ’ve insulted her , and I realize her attorneys are already probably on it . Actually , she ’s probably also already talked to Emily ’s boyfriend , who runs a business cleaning up reputations . I like to say I ’ve known him longer — he did some work for me after I was framed for shoplifting a few years ago — but after Emily ’s own desperate need for some reputation cleaning almost six months ago , she definitely knows him better . And she ’s far more satisfied with his performance . “

22503	22521	22500	22500	him	104	” I do n’t often get headaches , but when I do , my grandmother is involved . “

22555	22620	22528	22528	I	2293	” This is n’t the first time she ’s threatened to disinherit me , but I suspect it ’s about to be the last . The gig ’s up . She knows . She knows I ’m going to fuck this up . My heart is racing . My throat is dry . And panic is making the tips of my fingers go numb . “
22670	22671	22662	22662	I	2293	” “

22747	22814	22815	22815	I	2293	” I mentally curse in six different languages , but it does n’t help the gnawing fear now growing in my gut and the sudden realization that Bali is n’t happening either . But I also jut my chin up , because if I ’ve learned anything in working for my grandmother for well over a decade , it ’s that she actually respects a backbone . “
22824	22825	22815	22815	I	2293	” “
22831	22832	22815	22815	I	2293	” “
22838	22946	22815	22815	I	2293	” Fuck , what am I saying ? That I ’ll go get him ? I ca n’t have him here . He ’ll see right through me in two seconds , and it wo n’t be the Rodericks we ’re fighting . It ’ll be the man who stood in this office last night and told my grandmother to gird her loins , because he was coming for her great grandbaby . Is it possible to be utterly terrified and utterly turned on at the same time ? Because I think I ’m there . My grandmother watches me expectantly . I swallow and start again . “

22997	23002	22973	22973	I	2293	” she says dryly . “

24266	24339	24164	24167	an insta - family	802	“ Hey , that ’s what friends are for . Oh , and I went through Julienne ’s blog when I heard , because I know you know a ton about kids , but I thought it might be helpful to have a list of the brands she used . I mean , babies are sensitive to changes with diapers and formula — assuming he was n’t breastfed — so I thought … ”
24340	24351	24164	24167	an insta - family	802	“ Yeah . Yeah , that ’s great . Thanks . ”
24363	24413	24355	24355	I	2293	“ I ’ll text you the list . Or I can go get some for you ? Whichever . Whatever ’s most helpful . And if you need a babysitter , you know where to find me . Or I could come to you . Just let me know . ”

24649	24655	24656	24656	She	805	“ Ideally , or realistically ? ”
24668	24687	24665	24665	she	805	“ You were n’t nearly this kind of a killjoy when we both thought you were a stripper . ”
24744	24771	24772	24772	I	2293	“ Okay , Mr. Straight Shooter , here ’s the deal . Do you know anything about Anthony and Margot Roderick ? Remy ’s paternal grandparents ? ”
24811	25081	25082	25082	I	2293	“ They ’re basically dicks in human packaging , which means sometimes they get feelings . And currently , their feelings are hurt , as is their pride , so they ’re contesting Julienne ’s will . You ’d think it would be a good thing that multiple family members would want the little guy , but the truth is way more complicated . Anthony Roderick thinks that having money means he should own everything he sees , and that blood means ownership , which means he thinks Remy here should be his , except he raised Rafe , who was a douche , and yes , I ’m being polite because you should n’t speak ill of the dead . But the point is , if Anthony Roderick raises this baby , he , too , will turn out to be a worm , which is totally preventable , because look at this sweet face . As for Margot , without Remy , she ’ll lose her will to live . Which in theory would mean that we should save her life by giving her the baby , except it ’s not Remy ’s responsibility to be someone ’s reason to live . It ’s his responsibility to be a fucking baby and grow up and test limits and be himself , rather than the mold of his dead father that his grandmother would want to turn him into . Except it ’s possible all she wants him for is a vial of blood so she can take his DNA to a mad scientist to have Rafe recreated . ”
25138	25156	25133	25133	She	815	“ Dude . You do n’t have to like the truth for it to be the truth . ”
25157	25173	25133	25133	She	815	“ So the grandparents were n’t named in the will as guardians for a reason . ”
25174	25201	25123	25123	she	815	“ They did get fifty dollars to buy themselves a few sacks of manure . Not sure if you read far enough to see that part . ”
25202	25208	25209	25209	I	2293	“ So you need paperwork , ”
25223	25282	25218	25218	her	815	“ Oh ! No . Not at all . I mean , yes , my lawyers want you to sign a non - disclosure agreement about last night and everything I ’m about to tell you — they get so pissed when I forget this stuff — but actually , I want you to move in with me . ”
25318	25394	25311	25311	she	815	“ I do n’t know if you follow the tabloids , but I tend to show up in them . A lot . Most of the time depicted as … well , actually , fairly accurately . I work hard , so why should n’t I play hard too ? But , as I ’m sure you can imagine , it ’s not exactly the best look for the guardian of a baby , whereas — ”
25413	25423	25406	25406	I	2293	“ You need me to make you look good . ”
25424	25429	25430	25430	Her	815	“ I — yes . ”
25444	25536	25406	25406	I	2293	“ I can make it as painless as possible . We have a helicopter so you can avoid Miami traffic to get as close to job sites as possible . I ’ll take overnight shifts with the baby . And my chef can make any food you need . I know you still have a month left for house - sitting on the beach , but I can have one of my staff take over and keep an eye on things . Also , I know a lot of people who — ”
25537	25541	25409	25409	she	815	“ How long ? ”
25559	25655	25551	25551	she	817	“ Oh , not that long ! I mean , what ’s a few months in the grand scheme of things ? And you were going to need a new place to live soon anyway , so this way , you can just chill in one of my guest suites until you find a new place . I have plenty of room , plus a private beach , plus there ’s golf and watersports and the most amazing little village of shops in the Bluewater enclave . You ’d have access to all of it . ”
25656	25661	25551	25551	she	817	“ A few months . ”
25697	25704	25551	25551	she	817	“ Maybe a wee bit longer ? ”
25705	25734	25551	25551	she	817	“ What kind of dirt do they have on you that you need a total and complete stranger ’s help to make you look like the better option ? ”
25735	25862	25868	25868	she	818	“ I do n’t do anything I wo n’t own in public . And even if I ’d ever planned on having kids , I still would n’t apologize for living the hell out of my life . But not instantly knowing how to do all this caretaking stuff does n’t mean I ca n’t learn it . It just means I appear to have weaknesses and vulnerabilities in a court case until I look as competent as I feel . I know this is about as cluster - fucky as cluster - fucks can be , but I just need a little bit of temporary help . Remy needs a little bit of temporary help . And he ’s such a sweet little orphan baby . ”
25978	25987	25988	25988	I	2293	“ I need to talk to my lawyer , ”
25998	26012	25993	25993	She	818	“ I thought you might . I called him . He ’s outside . ”
27072	27077	27054	27054	I	2293	“ Yay ! Friends ! ”
27078	27088	27089	27089	Luna	144	“ Daisy ! Oh , I ’m so sorry . ”
27129	27141	27124	27124	she	144	“ Why did n’t you tell us about Julienne ’s funeral ? ”
27142	27184	27124	27124	she	144	“ She and I were n’t all that close . Actually , turns out , she was n’t really close to anyone . It ’s okay . Mom was there . You did n’t need to witness all that awkwardness too . ”
27185	27211	27124	27124	she	144	“ It was still a funeral . Do you need some dog hugs ? Dog hugs make everything better . I can bring Penelope over . ”
27212	27220	27221	27221	Cam	147	“ Oh my god , a baby , ”
27295	27338	27277	27277	her	144	“ You should ’ve texted sooner ! Do you know anything about raising babies ? I do n’t know anything about babies . But there ’s so much stuff about raising babies on the internet . We ’re going to be fine . ”
27339	27369	27370	27370	Emily	143	“ Have you talked to your lawyers yet ? Wait . Of course you have . Does he have a trust fund ? A college fund ? An IRA ? ”
27419	27510	27404	27404	She	143	“ Derek ’s team ’s going to get what they can out of Julienne ’s house — the electronics , I mean — before anyone seals it up pending the auction , and they ’ll see if they can find anything about when Julienne and Rafe made their will . He ’s also working on a plan to make you look like an angel and the Rodericks look like unfit parents . I ca n’t believe they ’re refuting the will . Did they honestly claim your grandmother forged it ? ”
27511	27523	27524	27524	Cam	147	“ What else can we do ? What do you need ? ”
27646	27653	27654	27654	I	2293	“ You guys are the best . ”
27800	27806	27807	27807	I	2293	“ Remy ’s basically broke , ”
27848	27886	27837	27844	these women who mean so much to me	866	“ but he ’s got me , so no worries there . As for what I know about babies … I’m getting plenty of on - the - job training , and he ’s really pretty awesome . ”
27887	27901	27902	27902	Luna	144	“ This baby is the luckiest baby in the world to have you , ”
27906	27912	27913	27913	Emily	143	“ In so many ways , ”
27916	27920	27921	27921	Cam	147	“ And us , ”
27925	27945	27921	27921	Cam	147	“ We ’re going to be the aunts he never knew he wanted . Dibs on the college fund ! ”
27946	27965	27966	27966	I	2293	“ I ’m sure my grandma ’s taking care of the college fund and trust fund and IRA , ”
27971	28031	28032	28032	Emily	143	“ Provided he does n’t fuck it up when he turns twenty - one , but she ’d be over a hundred by then , so he might be spared the family test . Except for the part where she ’s part - vampire and basically immortal . So maybe I should do a college fund for him too . ”
28037	28044	28045	28045	Cam	147	“ Vampire would explain a lot , ”
28055	28076	28045	28045	Cam	147	“ I wonder if the mirror thing is true . That would be a simple way to conduct a test . ”
28077	28087	28088	28088	Luna	144	“ What did your mom say about the baby ? ”
28111	28127	28103	28103	she	144	“ She does n’t know yet . She ’s out of reach on my yacht . ”
28149	28157	28158	28158	Emily	143	“ Will she try to move in ? ”
28161	28225	28158	28158	Emily	143	“ We can amend the community rules to dictate that anyone over thirty ca n’t live with their parents . I do n’t think it would impact any other families in the neighborhood . And I ’m already getting requests for another community forum since your note went out about increased security for the baby . But it would mean another association meeting … ”
28226	28239	28240	28240	I	2293	“ Oh , psh . I ’ll hire stunt doubles for us , ”
28244	28260	28261	28261	We	888	“ I ’m not letting a stunt double stand - in for me during negotiations . ”
28356	28374	28351	28351	Luna	144	“ Your house is n’t big enough to share with your mom ? Your mom is awesome . ”
28375	28379	28380	28380	I	2293	“ She is , ”
28383	28395	28380	28380	I	2293	“ But I still do n’t want her talking to Cristoff . ”
28549	28560	28561	28561	Cam	147	“ What ’s wrong with your mom talking to Cristoff ? ”
28564	28634	28561	28561	Cam	147	“ The last time she talked to him , she made him so mad in four seconds flat that he only prepped me California rolls and avocado pasta for the next three weeks . Which was delicious , by the way , because it ’s Cristoff , but the point is , they ca n’t exist in the same kitchen space if I want any variety in my menu . ”
28635	28662	28663	28663	Emily	143	“ Wait , was n’t that the time he made me that amazing garlic - shallot - butternut squash ravioli with prawns in a cream sauce ? ”
28666	28729	28663	28663	Emily	143	“ No , that was the time he gave you peanut butter sandwiches for a week . The ravioli was after one of my guests told him her chef did tuna steaks better , because her chef cooked them all the way through . So he was insulted , but mostly on behalf of the tuna instead of on his own behalf . ”
28730	28746	28753	28753	Luna	144	“ Oh . Okay , yes , your mom definitely ca n’t talk to Cristoff . ”
28747	28752	28753	28753	Luna	144	“ Oh , no ! ”
28757	28788	28789	28789	She	144	“ What are you going to do with the baby when you have to travel ? Does he have a nanny ? Will you take him along ? What about … ”
28841	28846	28830	28830	them	882	“ What about what ? ”
28866	28869	28870	28870	Cam	147	“ Wow , ”
28873	28879	28880	28880	Emily	143	“ Hello , arm porn , ”
28887	28921	28883	28883	Luna	144	“ Did you start dating American men again ? Because that man right there would convince me to date American men again if I were you . Or at least to consider it . ”
28922	28928	28929	28929	West	2385	“ Where ’s the baby ? ”
28932	28941	28942	28942	I	2293	“ He ’s rockin ’ the pool life , ”
28955	28964	28965	28965	He	2188	“ Water ’s perfect . Dive on in . ”
29072	29080	29081	29081	he	2188	“ Did you put sunscreen on him ? ”
29084	29095	29096	29096	Luna	144	“ Organic , baby - safe sunscreen , I hope , ”
29100	29105	29106	29106	Emily	143	“ Who are you ? ”
29133	29138	29139	29139	West	2385	“ Who are you ? ”
29183	29195	29196	29196	I	2293	“ So , that ’s the other part of my news , ”
29203	29253	29196	29196	I	2293	“ Westley Jaeger , meet Emily Stanton , Luna da Rosa , and Cameron Whitbury . Em trained our alligator to play fetch with men ’s balls , and Luna and Cam know how to dispose of a body , which is basically unnecessary when you consider the alligator . ”
29254	29260	29196	29196	I	2293	“ Was that a threat ? ”
29261	29293	29294	29294	I	2293	“ No , standard warning everyone gets when they visit Bluewater the first time . I could n’t possibly threaten you , given all that you ’re doing for my family . ”
29313	29357	29303	29303	I	2293	“ Julienne and Rafe designated West here as Remy ’s co - guardian . Best I can tell , it was because Julienne liked how his ass filled out his jeans while he was remodeling the baby ’s nursery a few months ago . ”
29358	29367	29368	29368	Emily	143	“ What are your intentions with this baby ? ”
29376	29385	29371	29371	West	2385	“ Are you related to Imogen Carter too ? ”
29411	29420	29421	29421	Luna	144	“ We are not going to be friends , ”
29424	29434	29435	29435	I	2293	“ He ’s cranky . Took the night shift , ”
29501	29514	29517	29517	him	2385	“ My three friends here helped design and build the Bluewater community , ”
29528	29608	29609	29609	Bluewater	12	“ They all run billion - dollar corporations and are strong , powerful , sexy - ass motherfucking women who are basically going to rule the world one day . Also known as Remy ’s de facto aunts , whom he ’ll probably love more than he loves me , which is saying something , because I ’m kinda fabulous , but I ’m going to have to learn to be a disciplinarian once he starts crawling and talking . ”
30116	30122	30106	30106	she	380	“ Is that the baby ? ”
30123	30128	30106	30106	she	380	“ Can we look ? ”
30129	30153	30106	30106	she	380	“ Have you held him ? Have you ever held a baby ? I do n’t think I ’ve ever held a baby . ”
30154	30184	30187	30187	Luna	144	“ Is it like taking care of a dog ? Let them run loose , poop in the yard , and then put out some food on the floor ? ”
30239	30245	30246	30246	Emily	143	“ Oh , those eyes , ”
30254	30262	30263	30263	Cam	147	“ Look at his little gummy smile ! ”
30272	30279	30263	30263	Cam	147	“ He does n’t have teeth ! ”
30280	30286	30287	30287	Luna	144	“ What does he need ? ”
30303	30318	30319	30319	West	2385	“ Does he need to like , go squat in the grass or something ? ”
30324	30332	30319	30319	West	2385	“ Why ’s he half - naked ? ”
30333	30338	30340	30340	myself	2293	“ He likes it . ”
30385	30425	30373	30373	he	1365	“ He might be planning on being a nudist . Which is awesome , if you ask me . He should definitely be comfortable in his own body . Maybe we should have nudist weekends , just for Remy . ”
30568	30586	30587	30587	he	155	“ If you want me to stay , you ’re going to have to change your tactics , ”
30591	30604	30605	30605	Emily	143	“ What right , exactly , do you have to this child ? ”
30608	30616	30605	30605	Emily	143	“ It ’s all in the will . ”
30632	30710	30617	30617	I	2293	“ Julienne and Rafe clearly knew what they were doing when they wrote it , even if none of the rest of us get it , so we ’re just figuring this out one day at a time . West comes from a good family , so it ’s not like I can object to one more person — or eighty more people — loving the baby . Do you remember May Ella Jaeger , the comedienne ? ”
30711	30714	30715	30715	Luna	144	“ Who ? ”
30718	30726	30727	30727	Cam	147	“ She has a special on Netflix ! ”
30730	30741	30727	30727	Cam	147	“ Jude and I started watching that the other night . ”
30747	30757	30758	30758	Cam	147	“ Just started ? It was n’t very good ? ”
30761	30773	30758	30758	Cam	147	“ No , it was very good ! We got distracted . ”
30774	30779	30780	30780	Luna	144	“ Good for you , ”
30783	30788	30780	30780	Luna	144	“ I love distracted . ”
30789	30796	30797	30797	Emily	143	“ It definitely does n’t suck , ”
30855	30866	30867	30867	I	2293	“ Anyway , May Ella Jaeger is West ’s mom , ”
30871	30882	30867	30867	I	2293	“ Which means he ’s hilarious too , of course . ”
30982	30993	30994	30994	Emily	143	“ How did you end up in the will again ? ”
30997	31009	31010	31010	he	217	“ They got drunk and drew names out of a hat , ”
31023	31029	31030	31030	Cam	147	“ I can see it , ”
31034	31038	31039	31039	Remy	1365	“ Logical explanation . ”
31063	31102	31044	31044	I	2293	“ Hey , there , you handsome devil . You ready for some yum - yum milky - milk ? Yes ? Yes , you are ? Who ’s a good boy ? Remy ’s a good boy . ”
31103	31111	31112	31112	Luna	144	“ It is like having a dog ! ”
31396	31407	31376	31376	Alessandro	2859	“ You ’re actually sticking around ? Without actual paperwork ? ”
31519	31522	31515	31515	I	2293	“ Yep . ”
31680	31687	31688	31688	Alessandro	2859	“ You the kid ’s father ? ”
31710	31715	31716	31716	He	989	“ What the fuck ? ”
31721	31757	31716	31716	He	989	“ Rafe Roderick was a cheating asshole . Julienne was no angel . Just because she was n’t a known cheat does n’t mean she did n’t do it . Not judging . Just asking . ”
31758	31765	31766	31766	His	989	“ You want a DNA test ? ”
31787	31818	31716	31716	He	989	“ Crowd like this , DNA test will be the only reason you stick around any longer than it takes to get Anthony and Margot Roderick out of the picture . ”
31819	31833	31834	31834	My	2293	“ That ’s all I ’m here for . Then I ’m gone . ”
31941	31966	31936	31936	Alessandro	2859	“ So you ’re not trying to replace Sierra ’s kids with Remy . Baxter and Nina , right ? Those were her kids ? ”
32012	32019	32020	32020	Daisy	97	“ Gentlemen , I ’m hungry , ”
32068	32081	32082	32082	I	2293	“ Fish Tails for lunch . Twenty minutes . Let ’s go . ”
32110	32122	32123	32123	she	97	“ Are you seriously doubting my abilities already , Mr. Jaeger ? ”
32134	32142	32123	32123	she	97	“ Just thinking delivery would be easier . ”
32143	32159	32123	32123	she	97	“ No way . I ’m not staying cooped up in this house all day . ”
32160	32169	32170	32170	I	2293	“ This house is forty thousand square feet , ”
32185	32192	32193	32193	Alessandro	2859	“ Go to a different room . ”
32229	32238	32239	32239	she	97	“ Suit yourself if you want to stay , ”
32242	32267	32270	32270	she	97	“ Remy and I are going to lunch . And we ’re going to have a fabulous time introducing him to all the neighbors . ”
32354	32361	32347	32347	Alessandro	2859	“ Just you backing her up ? ”
32687	32714	32715	32715	Alessandro	2859	“ Are we eating today , or should we just go throw ourselves in Steve ’s lagoon to spare ourselves the pain of starving to death ? ”
32718	32737	32715	32715	Alessandro	2859	“ I do n’t know who Steve is , but I ’m betting we should go with him , ”
32742	32748	32738	32738	West	2385	“ You two are adorable , ”
32824	32831	32832	32832	I	2293	“ We ’ll catch up later , ”
32839	32859	32836	32836	She	225	“ Bring the little one by the gym sometime soon . We ’ll show him how to lift weights . ”
32860	32866	32867	32867	I	2293	“ Get him started right , ”
32951	32958	32963	32963	her	143	“ Oh ! Is that Becca ? ”
33153	33159	33160	33160	I	2293	“ Do n’t be mad , ”
33167	33243	33160	33160	I	2293	“ My grandmother ’s background check on you was a little bit thorough . We went through and added all of your friends and family to the guest list , and when my assistant called Becca , she mentioned having diapers and formula as a baby gift , so we invited her to join us . Your family should feel free to drop by Miami anytime too . Cam really wants to meet your mom . ”
33269	33276	33277	33277	he	1030	“ Thanks . For the help , ”
33284	33295	33277	33277	he	1030	“ Of course ! That ’s what friends are for ! ”
33445	33448	33449	33449	I	2293	“ Becca ? ”
33459	33480	33449	33449	I	2293	“ Hi . I ’m Daisy . West has told me so much about what an awesome friend you are . ”
33565	33580	33581	33581	She	380	“ Oh ! Looks like our table ’s ready . Care to join us ? ”
33832	33837	33838	33838	Alessandro	2859	“ You ’re evil , ”
33843	33872	33838	33838	Alessandro	2859	“ Just because I ’m the byproduct of a messy divorce and have no use for commitment does n’t mean I believe other people should n’t have love . ”
33873	33884	33885	33885	I	2293	“ I do n’t think what they have is love . ”
34072	34076	34077	34077	I	2293	“ Hush puppies ? ”
34082	34113	34114	34114	Becca	663	“ Pixie makes the best hush puppies in the universe , and then she serves them with strawberry butter , which is basically like having an orgasm in your mouth . ”
34121	34127	34118	34118	West	2385	“ Yeah . Hush puppies . ”
34128	34133	34134	34135	Chipper Bergman	228	“ They ’re out , ”
34144	34156	34157	34161	A perky teenager with braces	1054	“ I really wanted hush puppies , but they ’re out . ”
34194	34198	34199	34199	she	1054	“ Good news , ”
34202	34279	34199	34199	she	1054	“ We found the batter . We ’re back in business . Hi , everyone . Welcome to Fish Tails ! I ’m Laney , and I ’ll be your server today . Hush puppies all around ? And for you too , Mr. Bergman . I got you covered . You all need menus , or did Daisy already tell you what ’s best ? You should listen to her . She never picks wrong . ”
34280	34316	34317	34317	He	1060	“ Flattering , but also true . I recommend the seafood bucket for you , Becca . And West , definitely try the coconut - crusted swordfish with the mango salsa . Life - changing . ”
34489	34495	34496	34496	Becca	663	“ Of course there is , ”
34527	34539	34512	34512	I	2293	“ So how do you two crazy kids know each other ? ”
34540	34548	34549	34549	Becca	663	“ We went to high school together , ”
34555	34559	34560	34560	Her	663	“ In Chicago ? ”
34571	34581	34565	34565	she	663	“ You … really know a lot about West . ”
34587	34597	34598	34598	West	2385	“ Occupational hazard of getting in bed with someone . ”
34603	34607	34608	34608	I	2293	“ Figuratively speaking , ”
34611	34727	34728	34728	Becca	663	“ When you ’re born in the world I ’m born in , you have to find out things about people . Sorry . Kind of . Also , I ’m having complicated feelings about co - inheriting a baby with a guy whose brother plays for the Thrusters . Am I going to get in trouble if I admit I seriously hate them because they beat my home team so bad in the hockey playoffs that I woke up bruised the next day ? Rude . How is Tyler , by the way ? I could see myself liking him a lot if he got himself traded down here . He should do that . ”
34779	34784	34785	34785	West	2385	“ He ’s amused , ”
34789	34808	34785	34785	West	2385	“ Oh , at the whole baby thing ? That is funny . My cousin was a riot . ”
34818	34835	34809	34809	Becca	663	“ She one - starred West ’s job on her nursery . She was n’t funny . ”
34836	34947	34948	34948	Becca	663	“ She one - starred a gallery opening for my mom ’s new jewelry line once . Mom put itching powder in her sheets in retribution . Now that was funny . Not the part where Julienne was dating a guy at the time who liked to secretly record sex tapes — hello , human decency and privacy laws — but definitely the part where Mom showed her actions have consequences . In the form of Julienne accidentally doing a sex tape where she could n’t get off because she was itching so bad . Or so I heard . I do n’t like watching people ’s private sex tapes . ”
34986	35000	35001	35001	Becca	663	“ Your mom sounds … like she ’ll have fun being a grandma , ”
35025	35051	35052	35052	I	2293	“ Oh , she will . If it were up to her , I ’d have seventeen kids . How many do you guys want ? ”
35069	35083	35058	35058	I	2293	“ Each , I mean . Sorry . I worded that all wrong . ”
35084	35095	35096	35096	Becca	663	“ I have the only two I ’m ever having . ”
35140	35147	35180	35180	he	1070	“ What about you , Daisy ? ”
35148	35172	35180	35180	he	1070	“ Never gave it much thought . West ? Your turn . Is Remy it , or do you want more one day ? ”
35196	35199	35200	35200	he	1070	“ Six , ”
35203	35219	35200	35200	he	1070	“ Be terrible to deprive Remy of the joy of siblings , would n’t it ? “
35303	35356	35357	35357	You	1077	” I smile . Becca ’s forced smile freezes awkwardly , and she looks at me , then West , then back to me , like it ’s dawning on her that I might want him around . That ’s right , Becca . He ’s a catch . Open your eyes . “
35369	35375	35376	35377	Total dad	1078	” I whisper to her . “
35392	35393	35394	35394	I	2293	” “
35398	35402	35394	35394	I	2293	” she stutters . “
35410	35414	35394	35394	I	2293	” Laney announces . “
35443	35444	35441	35441	Laney	230	” “
35452	35668	35441	35441	Laney	230	” She smiles and swings around to put a second basket of hush puppies on Chipper ’s table . I pour mango sweet teas all around and pass around the plates , then insist everyone try at least one hush puppy smothered all to hell with the strawberry butter . Becca moans when she bites into it . I moan louder . West ducks his head over his plate and stares at it while he sucks his sweet tea through a straw . His ears have gone pink and it ’s only the fact that he looks utterly miserable that ’s keeping me from actually having fun right now . Any woman who only wants a man after another woman shows interest in him is n’t a woman that deserves a guy like West . Like sixty percent of my good ideas , this one was n’t actually a good idea . Informative , but I really should n’t have done it . Alessandro sends me a warning glare , and it ’s not a quit being a dick look . It ’s a do n’t get more ideas look . Like I would n’t be doing West a favor if I showed him that there are women in the world who would appreciate him . “
35677	35746	35669	35669	I	2293	” I declare , and I pop the rest of mine into my mouth with another moan . When I open my eyes , both West and Becca are staring at me , though West quickly goes back to scanning the restaurant like he ’s worried about rabid alligators invading and trying to eat us all . I dab my lips with my napkin and smile at them . “
35767	35768	35762	35762	You	1080	” “
35771	35789	35790	35791	Two girls	1082	” She straightens with a smile like it ’s a relief to be back on neutral ground . “
35837	35838	35830	35830	I	2293	” “
35881	35912	35879	35879	superstar	1084	” I fist bump her while she goes back to slightly star struck , which is sad , because people should always tell moms they ’re doing an awesome job . “
35925	35926	35927	35927	I	2293	” “
35936	35937	35927	35927	I	2293	” “
35962	36062	35958	35958	They	1087	” I ’ve even partied with a few of them . But Becca does n’t strike me as the rainbow shots type of accountant . And West definitely needs a rainbow shots kind of girl . I have a sense about these things . But while West sits there studying me like he ’s trying to figure out if I ’m playing a game with his lady friend , she beams like I ’ve just told her she ’s the new queen of Fish Tail - landia . And I beam right back while I grab another hush puppy . “
36075	36079	36082	36082	babies	2324	” she asks . “
36084	36085	36082	36082	babies	2324	” “
36105	36625	36626	36626	I	2293	” West is still watching me . And that ’s all he does until our food arrives . He watches me charm the pants off his lady friend . Figuratively , I mean . Unfortunately . It ’s always more fun when clothes actually come off . Fourteen West Our food has n’t even arrived before I ’m realizing that Daisy is perfectly competent at anything she wants to do . From running a real estate empire to playing fucking matchmaker to learning everything she needs to know from someone who does n’t realize she does n’t know it . Anyone walking by — and Becca herself — would see Daisy building Becca up like the best mom in the entire universe . You hold him so well . Aw , is he looking at your necklace ? Babies love shiny dangly things , do n’t they ? When did your girls say their first words ? She ’s making Becca ’s whole entire year . But she ’s also soaking in every word like Becca ’s offering a crash course on motherhood . Which will be catastrophic if Daisy decides Becca needs to be her new best friend . My nerves can tolerate a lot . Having Daisy talk me up to Becca while pretending she ’s a ditz who misses social cues and needs motherhood advice ? It ’s worse than having my mother play matchmaker . And she once asked a sold - out theater if there were any takers for her single military son , because she wanted grandbabies . It got so many laughs it went in permanently and now everyone in the world with a Netflix account can soak up the glory of my mother ’s sense of humor about my single status . Our food arrives . Becca keeps holding Remy and telling Daisy stories about raising her girls while she balances eating with jiggling him anytime he makes a little noise . He ’s a funny kid . Does n’t just sleep all the time . Sometimes he ’s looking around like he ’s not sure how he ended up in this weird world , or what it all means . Other times he has this almost - smile on his face that makes me think he knows something I do n’t . He might only be two months old , but he already has a personality . And if personality is genetic — I shoot another glance at Daisy when our food arrives — then he ’ll go places in the world . Whether those places are good places or bad places , he ’ll undoubtedly jump in with both feet . And there ’s a gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach that suggests overnight is all I needed to fall in love with the little guy . To want to be here to see him grow up . Fuck . Just babysitting , I remind myself . I ’m just here temporarily babysitting . I can care , but I need to be prepared to move on . “
36634	36639	36626	36626	I	2293	” Daisy tells Becca . “
36687	36731	36681	36681	She	1096	” Becca ’s big red seafood bucket is overflowing with more shrimp , crawfish , and crab legs than two Marines could eat in an entire day , which is impressive , and it smells like melted butter topped with deliciousness and magic . “
36741	36749	36681	36681	She	1096	” Becca says with a small laugh . “
36757	36767	36768	36768	I	2293	” Daisy winks and slides a glance my way . “
36797	36873	36789	36789	you	1093	” They swap parts of their lunch like they ’re long - lost sisters , and Becca slides me a look as though she ’s wondering what Daisy ’s seen on me that ’s huge . She has n’t mentioned her new boyfriend again . And I do n’t give two fucks . What the hell was I thinking ? Becca is n’t into me . And honestly ? I was n’t really into her . “
36879	36884	36876	36876	your	1093	” Daisy asks me . “
36909	36939	36900	36900	Pixie	227	” She plucks a fry off my plate and moans again . Threesome ! Threesome ! Threesome ! my nuts chant . I need to get them a muzzle . “
36946	36960	36961	36961	He	1097	” Becca says while she tries to shell a shrimp one - handed . “
37010	37074	37002	37002	he	1097	” She points to the window beside us , overlooking a garden with lush plants and curving pathways . I do n’t know what ’s around the bend , but I suspect it ’s more million - dollar homes and golf cart trails . My sisters would n’t be able to stop gawking at anything here . Tyler would fit right in though . “
37084	37094	37002	37002	he	1097	” I tell her , pointing to the baby . “
37102	37274	37002	37002	he	1097	” I take Remy , who waves his arms like he ’s telling me a story , and let the women keep talking while I go back to watching the surroundings and bouncing twelve pounds of sweet baby . Also , the swordfish is perfection . Do n’t need to engage in the conversation going on around me , especially with a delicious meal to savor , and honestly , their words are flowing too fast for my one good ear to catch everything . Almost like being at home . I take a bite of swordfish , make a face at Remy , who coos or tries to smile back , sweep a glance around the restaurant , then give a cursory study of the women . And repeat . Until I notice Daisy ’s lips are swelling . Are they ? Or is this a trick of the light ? She frowns and touches two fingers to her bottom lip , like she ’s realizing something is off too . “
37282	37302	37002	37002	he	1097	” she asks . Red creeps up her neck , and she attacks it with her French manicured fingernails . “
37307	37311	37002	37002	he	1097	” I mutter . “
37318	37319	37320	37321	My mom	663	” “
37332	37352	37328	37328	I	2293	” She tries to clear her throat . Then tries again . Alessandro tips his table lunging toward us . “
37355	37421	37328	37328	I	2293	” he barks . All my instincts say I need to get her to Benedryl first , then epinephrine if that does n’t work , but I ’m holding a baby , and Becca ’s shrieking and diving for cover while Alessandro leaps for Daisy . Her whole face is mottled red now , and she ’s alternately scratching her skin and trying to talk . “
37424	37428	37429	37429	Benedryl	239	” I say . “
37431	37491	37429	37429	Benedryl	239	” Alessandro barks at a server , who shrieks , drops a full platter of fish sandwiches , and breaks into a run toward the kitchen . I leap up , baby in hand , while everyone in the restaurant starts moving , craning necks , stepping out of their seats for closer looks , rising in the aisles . “
37497	37502	37503	37503	I	2293	” I tell Alessandro . “
37508	37513	37503	37503	I	2293	” he growls back . “
37530	37531	37503	37503	I	2293	” “
37535	37540	37503	37503	I	2293	” Daisy croaks out . “
37550	37551	37552	37552	She	239	” “
37559	37574	37575	37575	Daisy	155	” Alessandro ’s taking her pulse when the chef dashes out of the kitchen . “
37577	37589	37575	37575	Daisy	155	” the perky lady with blue pigtails under her hairnet wails . “
37603	37604	37596	37596	I	2293	” “
37614	37615	37616	37616	Benedryl	239	” “
37618	37655	37616	37616	Benedryl	239	” the chef shrieks , shoving a box at Alessandro . He rips the package in half , sending pill packs flying onto the neighboring tables , then pops one out and shoves it at Daisy . “
37663	37671	37672	37672	Baby	165	” He turns a glare on me . “
37678	37782	37672	37672	Baby	165	” The blue - haired woman bursts into tears . Remy bursts into tears . Alessandro tosses Daisy over his shoulder , and stomps out of the restaurant through the growing crowd . I want to follow , but for what ? To be one more person slowing them down ? I ’m not her relative . I should n’t be anything to her . Still , my heart ’s in my throat , and I ca n’t tilt my good ear close enough to the door to hear what ’s being said out there along with seeing which direction they ’re going . “
37788	37807	37672	37672	Baby	165	” Becca says behind me . She ’s huffing like she leapfrogged the tables to get to us . “
37815	37986	37809	37809	we	1107	” I nod , even though I do n’t want to go anywhere except wherever Daisy went , because christ on a cracker , if the Benedryl does n’t work and she does n’t get to an emergency room fast enough — I shudder . And then I feel movement under my left hand . The hand holding Remy ’s butt . And is n’t that just about the most appropriate thing in the entire world ? Fifteen West Becca offers to drive me back to Daisy ’s house after I get Remy ’s diaper changed and attempt to pay the bill . Pixie , the chef , refuses to let me , so I leave a nice tip on the table , and we quietly slip out the back toward the small parking lot where Becca ’s car is waiting . On the way , we pass a small , fenced - in lagoon with Steve ’s House on a sign . I stop and squint at the gator . “
37995	38000	37809	37809	we	1107	” I ask aloud . “
38007	38026	38027	38027	I	2293	” the parrot from yesterday morning squawks at me . Christ . Was that really just yesterday morning ? “
38036	38044	38027	38027	I	2293	” Becca says with a forced cheer . “
38053	38054	38046	38046	you	1108	” “
38062	38080	38057	38057	She	155	” She better be fucking fine , because I ’m about done with the emotional roller coaster . “
38094	38098	38087	38087	I	2293	” Becca offers . “
38122	38123	38116	38116	Daisy	155	” “
38126	38307	38116	38116	Daisy	155	” I agree . I try to smile back at her , but it ’s hard to smile when you ’re gripping a phone so hard you can feel it in your molars . Not that I expect either of them to call me with an update , but I ’d very much like to hear that Daisy ’s okay . Becca looks away toward the parking lot . We manage to get most everything crammed in the trunk of her Corolla — which is easier than it was to cram it into Daisy ’s Daisy Wagon — and we go out of our way to not accidentally touch while getting Remy ’s baby carrier strapped in well enough without the built - in base that hooks into the car ’s latch system . The entire ride to Daisy ’s mansion , the only thing we talk about is which street to turn on . As soon as the porte - cochère comes into view around the bend , and then the house itself , Becca gawks with undisguised lust . “
38310	38369	38370	38370	Daisy	155	” She finds a house more sexually attractive than she finds me . And I ’m not as offended as I should be , but I still feel fucking awkward . A woman I vaguely recognize — Daisy ’s personal assistant , I think — bustles out the front door when we stop under the porte - cochère . “
38377	38382	38370	38370	Daisy	155	” she tells me . “
38397	38398	38390	38390	Imogen	155	” “
38403	38416	38390	38390	Imogen	155	” Becca says , but she ’s still gaping at the house . “
38433	38434	38424	38424	I	2293	” “
38450	38451	38442	38442	I	2293	” “
38454	38522	38523	38523	She	155	” I wince , knowing I sound like an ass . But I ’m feeling like an ass . I do n’t want to watch Becca ooh and aah over Daisy ’s house . Nor do I want her to get scrutinized by the devil woman who thinks I ’m an inconvenience at best , and a pain in the ass to be disposed of at worst . “
38544	38553	38535	38535	I	2293	” She smiles again without meeting my eyes . “
38558	38559	38560	38560	I	2293	” “
38566	38602	38560	38560	I	2293	” I ’m a fucking retired Marine and I feel as smooth as a thirteen - year - old kid hiding from his sisters while drooling over the lingerie models in the JC Penney catalog . “
38621	38649	38618	38618	I	2293	” Yeah . The part where I was n’t talking and Daisy ’s face was n’t swelling like a red balloon . I gesture to her trunk . “
38653	38654	38651	38651	you	1110	” “
38669	38854	38666	38666	You	1110	” Ten minutes later , one of the security guys from the house and I finally get everything dragged through the front door . Remy fell asleep in the car halfway through a bottle , so he ’s the easiest part . The security guy is no help when we find Imogen Carter pacing the sitting room just beyond the foyer though . Dude up and disappears . And I ’m left standing there staring at a wily old lady with calculating blue eyes who could n’t walk her ass thirty feet out the door to help drag in diapers and formula and baby gear . It pisses me off even more than today already has . I do n’t like being pissed . I like being happy that I ’m alive in a world that ’s not perfect , but does its best . Yet since Thursday afternoon , very little is going smoothly . I drop everything but the baby in a heap on the marble floor . Remy , I place down gently , since he ’s sleeping in his carrier . “
38857	38897	38898	38898	I	2293	” I snap . She draws her shoulders back and glares at me with the kind of glare that could explain the dinosaurs going extinct all those millions of years ago , if she ’d been around back then . “
38909	38910	38901	38901	Remington	86	” “
38913	38914	38915	38916	Mr. Jaeger	104	” “
38918	38919	38920	38920	He	104	” “
38932	38933	38934	38934	You	104	” “
38949	38950	38951	38951	I	2293	” “
38962	38963	38959	38959	he	104	” “
38976	38989	38969	38969	You	104	” Christ . This woman knows how to piss a person off . “
39122	39196	39197	39198	Mr. Jaeger	104	” Huh . She just grew two feet taller . That ’s probably a bad sign . Also a bad sign ? That she can make me lose my temper with four words . There ’s something about her haughty insistence that the world bend to her just because she wants it to that sets off all of my triggers . Who is she , really , to think she can play god ? “
39233	39281	39231	39231	Remington	86	” I fold my arms and glare at her . She folds her arms and glares back . Daisy ’s assistant is perched on the curved glass staircase behind us , leaning forward for a better angle on her phone . Fuck . She ’s recording this . “
39284	39288	39231	39231	Remington	86	” I growl , “
39294	39295	39296	39296	I	2293	” “
39309	39310	39311	39311	Daisy	155	” “
39328	39380	39325	39325	I	2293	” Fuck . Fuck . I do n’t know where the hell that came from , but it ’s stupidly satisfying to see her face drain of all the blood . Maybe this is why Daisy likes chaos so much . There ’s power in unpredictability when dealing with her grandmother . “
39385	39389	39392	39392	we	1123	” she breathes . “
39394	39437	39392	39392	we	1123	” She does n’t know if she should believe me . Lying goes against everything I was taught growing up , and everything I learned as a Marine . But nothing about the past few days has followed the rules of life . “
39443	39447	39448	39448	I	2293	” I growl . “
39458	39477	39448	39448	I	2293	” The assistant is still aiming her phone at all of us . Definitely recording this for YouTube . “
39502	39507	39493	39493	she	155	” I tell Imogen . “
39529	39530	39531	39531	Tiana	380	” “
39537	39545	39535	39535	Daisy	155	” she barks . The assistant shrugs . “
39583	39584	39573	39573	Alessandro	2859	” “
39592	39593	39594	39594	She	155	” “
39607	39624	39601	39601	she	155	” Her neck swivels until she ’s aiming that apocalypse - inducing glare at me again . “
39630	39641	39625	39625	You	1132	” Christ . Am I in a soap opera now ? “
39675	39761	39764	39765	Mrs. Carter	124	” She sucks in an audible breath , and I ca n’t decide if I regret all those hours I spent listening to my sisters discuss Pretty Is As Pretty Does , that daytime show that my mom got them all addicted to , or if I ’m having fun . I ’m probably not having fun if I have to question it . She snaps her fingers , and a butler who was hiding behind a giant palm in the corner leaps to attention . “
39767	39768	39769	39769	Pierson	133	” “
39775	39784	39769	39769	Pierson	133	” She spears me with one last glare . “
39818	40077	40078	40078	I	2293	” Definitely not happening . I have jobs to finish . A house to check on . And some sanity to get in touch with . But mostly , I need to make sure Daisy ’s okay . And break the news to her that we ’re married . Christ . I do n’t know who I am today , but it ’s not the same person I was when I woke up yesterday . Sixteen Daisy My face is the mushy part of an overripe seedless watermelon . I know I ’m only pretty because I ’m rich . My eyes are too wide - set , my mouth too big , my nose too small , and my cheeks too round . I know this . I accept this . And because I have the personality to compensate for it , it never really bothers me . Until times like today , when I feel utterly stupid for not seeing the warning signs sooner . The last time I had shrimp , I caught a six - hour cold and thought I ’d gotten stung by a honeybee on the lip when I was n’t watching my drink carefully out on my boat . The time before that , I caught a rash on my face that I attributed to uneven sunscreen distribution . But now , my entire body has revolted to let me know , in no uncertain terms , that just like my mother , I ’ve developed a shellfish allergy in adulthood . “
40084	40102	40078	40078	I	2293	” I whine to Alessandro while he drives us across the final bridge to my humble abode . “
40159	40185	40187	40187	you	1139	” He humors me with a grunt of agreement . At least , I ’m calling it agreement . He ’d probably call it frustration . “
40193	40197	40199	40199	I	2293	” I add . “
40218	40219	40220	40220	Tiana	380	” “
40226	40267	40220	40220	Tiana	380	” We turn down my seashell drive , and I frown . My eyes are still a little blurry from all the swelling and tears , but there ’s definitely a big black truck parked under my porte - cochère . “
40276	40277	40274	40274	Becca	1346	” “
40285	40286	40280	40281	Mr. Jaeger	104	” “
40291	40328	40280	40281	Mr. Jaeger	104	” Relief I did n’t know I needed floods through my limbs . He ’s still here . Probably with Remy . I hop out of my car as soon as it slows to a roll . “
40331	40335	40280	40281	Mr. Jaeger	104	” Alessandro orders . “
40349	40350	40351	40351	I	2293	” “
40355	40359	40351	40351	I	2293	” I retort . “
40369	40417	40361	40361	I	2293	” I need to check on the baby . Who am I ? It has n’t even been forty - eight hours , and I ’m all … motherly . I fling open the door , and seven cats shriek , meow , and dart at me . “
40420	40421	40361	40361	I	2293	” “
40424	40425	40426	40426	Meow	2293	” “
40428	40429	40426	40426	Meow	2293	” “
40432	40461	40426	40426	Meow	2293	” I gape at the tortoiseshell cat , because is he bungee jumping from the stairs or something ? But no . He just has a weird meow . “
40466	40472	40426	40426	Meow	2293	” Alessandro says behind me . “
40481	40485	40426	40426	Meow	2293	” I whisper . “
40501	40649	40426	40426	Meow	2293	” I do n’t answer , but instead dash past my sunken sitting room and down the hall toward my lounges . You ca n’t keep a reputation for being an epic party - thrower without having themed lounges . Plus , I get bored easily . And I like variety when I ’m hosting friends . Acquaintances . Same thing . Also , I would n’t normally be upset about seven cats wandering around my house — we’d catch them all eventually , and if one got out , it would be very well cared for in Bluewater — except I do n’t know how cats are with babies . Or how babies are with cats . And if this did n’t get cleared off my schedule , who else can sneak into my house ? Shit . I need to get more responsible . Now . “
40658	40672	40673	40673	I	2293	” Alessandro says while I race toward the end of the curved hall . “
40715	40867	40679	40693	Beck ’s friends who runs a cat shelter that they could do a photo shoot	1143	” I swing into the last room , my current favorite party room , which is basically one huge room of interconnected trampolines with ball pits lining the black walls , and instead of dozens of cats bouncing on trampolines , there ’s a single chubby calico meowing plaintively from the center trampoline while Luna ’s boyfriend , Beck , tries to crawl carefully out to get her . And there ’s a photographer happily snapping away as the big blond bearded biker dude tries to not scare the single cat left on the trampoline . I hold up a hand to stop Alessandro . The poor kitty looks terrified . If anyone can reach her , Beck can , but only if we do n’t scare the piss out of her first . We back out of the room , because my face could scare a shapeshifting vampire wildebeest today . “
40875	40883	40679	40693	Beck ’s friends who runs a cat shelter that they could do a photo shoot	1143	” my bodyguard asks . I shrug . “
40890	40891	40679	40693	Beck ’s friends who runs a cat shelter that they could do a photo shoot	1143	” “
40894	40916	40917	40917	We	1147	” a breathless Tiana answers as she bustles in from the courtyard . I owe her overtime for coming in today . “
40946	41005	40935	40935	I	2293	” I keep waiting for the day that they both get frustrated with me and leave , but so far , I have yet to drive them to drink or quit . It helps that when my grandmother insisted I hire a security team , I picked my own head bodyguard instead of letting her have a say . “
41015	41019	40935	40935	I	2293	” she adds . “
41053	41054	41042	41042	He	1346	” “
41059	41077	41042	41042	He	1346	” She finally looks straight at me , gasps , and she stumbles back half a step . “
41093	41099	41042	41042	He	1346	” I touch my face . “
41124	41125	41126	41126	He	2385	” “
41226	41227	41212	41212	I	2293	” “
41233	41234	41212	41212	I	2293	” “
41237	41259	41212	41212	I	2293	” Clearly , I do n’t pay her to lie to me . I wince , which makes my skin hurt . “
41270	41271	41212	41212	I	2293	” “
41319	41845	41310	41310	you	1156	” I do n’t need my game face . I need to find West and the baby . But they ’re not in any of the lounges . Nor in any of the sitting areas . I cover the entire hump of the D of my house , all three levels . The courtyard , where a cat has settled onto a floatie and is sunbathing in the center of my pool . I head to my private wing , because I ’m still in stilettos and I do n’t feel like stilettos when my face is sore and my hands are starting to shake from the amount of Benedryl and adrenaline still pumping through my system and this niggling fear over not being able to find West . Why have n’t I programmed his number into my phone yet ? Also , if I ’m going to have to lead a search party to find Julienne ’s baby and my co - guardian , I want my face to match my clothes . In other words , I ’d like to be scary as hell when I find him , so he knows he damn well better never take that baby anywhere without telling me again . What if he hopped a boat and they capsized too , just like Julienne and Rafe ? What if they went wandering through the enclave and did n’t realize that Steve ’s house is for an alligator , not a dog , and tried to get into the fence to the lagoon to pet him ? I do n’t think Steve likes human as much as he ’s developed a taste for chicken since we adopted him and gave him his prosthetic leg , but I do n’t know that for sure , because I do n’t feed humans to the alligator . I ’m working myself into a panic as I race through changing into hot pink tiger - striped yoga pants and a unicorn tank top offering to bake you some shut the fuckupcakes — it ’s battle armor — and then search my bedroom , home spa , closets , secret library , and office , just in case he ’s snooping . But he ’s not . He ’s nowhere in my private wing , not even in the rooftop gardens . I spin in a slow circle , squinting in the sunshine at the palm trees dotting the landscape in Bluewater beyond my house , the roofs of the village , the condo buildings , the thickets of saw palmettos and hibiscus on the paths to Luna , Emily , and Cam ’s houses , and the bay , and as I ’m finishing my circle , movement at my scrotum pool makes me pause . There he is . Pacing in front of the pool house , phone to his ear , which hopefully means Remy ’s with him in the building . I head down the back staircase that leads to the shortcut to my second pool . West ’s voice travels down the short pathway , and I freeze . “
41880	41904	41871	41871	I	2293	” There ’s a splash , and I peek around the corner to see waves rippling out in the center of my pool . “
41914	41946	41906	41906	you	155	” He jerks his head in my direction . Relief washes over his face , his shoulders relax , and he starts to rub his eyebrow , then stops and growls . “
41988	41996	41998	41998	you	155	” He blows out a short breath . “
42001	42026	41998	41998	you	155	” I do n’t take orders . I give orders . But the concern laced into his tirade has me pulling out my phone . “
42058	42153	42053	42053	I	2293	” He rattles off the number , and I send him a quick note with both Alessandro ’s and Tiana ’s numbers attached . His phone dings , which means that was n’t his phone he sent flying into the pool . I take a subtle glance to make sure he did n’t chuck Remy into the water . Definitely not a baby in there . I stifle a snort as I realize it ’s one of my mom ’s crystal dicks . Probably should n’t leave her artwork lying around the patio tables . “
42179	42180	42181	42181	He	1164	” “
42188	42222	42181	42181	He	1164	” Oh , sarcasm at its finest . That should n’t be attractive , but it ’s making me a little hot under the collar . Side effect of the Benedryl , undoubtedly . “
42227	42228	42224	42224	he	1164	” “
42239	42240	42235	42235	He	1164	” “
42269	42270	42259	42259	I	2293	” “
42275	42276	42259	42259	I	2293	” “
42283	42487	42259	42259	I	2293	” His eyes narrow again while he studies me . I get my picture taken a million times in a weekend when I ’m out having fun . I get stared down in boardrooms on a regular basis . And I have to deal with my grandmother ’s scrutiny every waking minute of my life . I get used to it . But West studying the blotchy , saggy mess that ’s currently my face ? It ’s making me more self - conscious than that time an ass shot of me in a thong while I was on my period went around the internet . Seventeen was a horrible age for wearing dresses that got caught in the wind . And he ’s going to tell me I ’m beautiful just the way I am , and I ’m going to have to punch him , because he does n’t get to say nice things about me right now . That would make me like him entirely too much when I might possibly already like him entirely too much simply for being here . And also lose a little respect for him for lying to me . I ’m complicated like that . “
42501	42506	42259	42259	I	2293	” he finally says , “
42536	43070	42533	42534	the kid	2286	” Oh , fuck . He went and said the only thing worse than telling me I ’m beautiful . And I ’m nothing if not impulsive . Which is technically my excuse for what I do next , even if I would ’ve done it anyway . I ’m impulsive like that . Seventeen West One minute , I ’m insulting Daisy ’s appearance , and the next , she ’s leaping into the air , wrapping her arms and legs around me , and pressing a hard kiss to my lips . My dazed brain registers plump breasts pressed to my chest , curvy thighs nestled against my cock , a luscious ass in my hands — because yes , of course I ’m going to catch her — and the sweet Kool - Aid taste of her lips , and my balls whoop and holler and ask someone to hold their beer . I ’m not going to kiss her back — except suddenly I am , because even while being so pissed at her for everything from Becca to the allergic reaction , I ’m so fucking grateful she ’s okay . And now I ’m slanting my lips against hers while relief courses through me that she ’s alive and kicking and breathing , while simultaneously being pissed as hell that no one in her household would tell me how she was doing . I ’m going to kiss her until she never leaves me hanging and uncertain while she ’s being rushed to an emergency room again . That … made a lot more sense when my nuts said it . She parts her lips and her tongue dives into my mouth and holy sweet fuck , is there anything she does n’t throw herself into full - throttle ? I ’d be lying if I said it was n’t attractive as hell that she ’s leaping into this motherhood thing without an ounce of complaint . And I barely know her , except this whole co - guardianship thing — it ’s making me learn her fast . That ’s what I ’m talking about ! my nuts crow . Hump her ! Hump her naked ! Christ . I ca n’t make out with Daisy . I ’m only here to help her get custody of Remington . And apparently to piss her grandmother off . That striptease thing the other night was a joke from the universe that usually gives me window seats and green lights , and I need to remember my place . My purpose . Which is for a kid to get a good home with his family , not for me to have a weekend fling with a partying heiress who suddenly seems like so much more . I wrench myself out of the kiss . Wide , blood - shot eyes blink at me like she forgot where she was . Or who she was kissing . Impossible . We ’re experts and unforgettable , my balls tell me . Fuckers need to shut up . She blinks once more , then she smacks me lightly in the shoulder . “
43083	43143	43144	43144	I	2293	” she orders , but there ’s a twinkle in her eye that spells out D - O - O - M. Specifically , mine . She ’s still gripping my hips with her thighs like I ’m the pole and she ’s the dancer , and it ’s affecting my pole . Blue . Her eyes are blue . “
43151	43156	43144	43144	I	2293	” I tell her . “
43162	43180	43183	43183	I	2293	” I have to clear my throat to get rid of that frog suddenly croaking inside it . “
43199	43200	43191	43191	I	2293	” “
43209	43210	43202	43202	she	84	” “
43213	43214	43202	43202	she	84	” “
43273	43302	43303	43303	I	2293	” My jaw clenches , my ass bunches , and I ’d curl my fingers into fists if they were n’t already digging into Daisy ’s butt cheeks . “
43312	43320	43303	43303	I	2293	” I grit out . She smiles . “
43333	43334	43303	43303	I	2293	” “
43345	43436	43303	43303	I	2293	” Her smile gets bigger . Fuck , she ’s pretty when she smiles . Even with her face blotchy and shiny and still slightly swollen , and her eyes bloodshot , and her bright red hair lopsided and frizzy in its ponytail . I ’d blame sleep deprivation , but I got by just fine in my twenty sleep - deprived years in the military without fantasizing about any of the female Marines I occasionally came into contact with , which means whatever ’s going on here is bad . “
43444	43445	43303	43303	I	2293	” “
43451	43452	43447	43447	we	1175	” “
43458	43459	43447	43447	we	1175	” “
43470	43471	43472	43472	I	2293	” “
43478	43479	43472	43472	I	2293	” “
43498	43506	43491	43491	I	2293	” She ’s definitely rubbing against me . “
43520	43521	43491	43491	I	2293	” “
43616	43617	43619	43619	you	1184	” “
43625	43626	43627	43627	I	2293	” “
43646	43692	43642	43642	they	1188	” My sisters would love her . Which is exactly what I ’ve thought about every single woman I ’ve ever dated . And not a single one of those dates have ended well . Some , in fact , have ended worse than others . “
43700	43704	43693	43693	You	1184	” I repeat . “
43715	43719	43693	43693	You	1184	” She shrugs . “
43749	43750	43741	43741	you	1184	” “
43780	43781	43778	43778	yourself	1184	” “
43822	43823	43815	43816	a woman	2405	” “
43832	43833	43815	43816	a woman	2405	” “
43854	43869	43839	43839	I	2293	” I release her butt and lift my hands . She does n’t move . “
43872	43883	43839	43839	I	2293	” I sigh . My sisters will definitely love her . “
43886	43887	43839	43839	I	2293	” “
43914	43955	43966	43966	his	1365	” She leaps off me like she ’s a freaking gymnast who did n’t just hide a truly sweet sentiment behind what I hope is a huge exaggeration , and turns and sashays her curvy ass to the pool house . “
44000	44352	43992	43992	I	2293	” No . It ’s not weird . But her saying it is provoking the kind of reaction that means I need a cold shower . I already knew I was getting attached to Remy . I do n’t need my nuts suggesting we should get attached to Daisy too . Even if watching her hold the baby is making my heart whisper that it might be too late anyway . Eighteen Daisy West is avoiding me . He says he ’s baby - proofing and cat - hunting , but I know he ’s avoiding me . Since I got back from the hospital yesterday , we ’ve spoken exactly thirty - four times , which is way less than I usually talk to houseguests . Especially since he ’s refused to take the bait to talk about anything other than Remy . But the baby gifts are starting to roll in , and he definitely needs to see the frog urinal that the prince of Stölland sent , so Sunday evening , while Cristoff is in the kitchen muttering to himself about not being able to use shellfish in my dishes anymore , I go searching out my co - guardian again . But first , I strap Remy to my chest with the new baby backpack that came from a former boyfriend who loves to take six - week hikes through the mountain . I ’m well aware it ’s supposed to go on my back , but I do n’t like not having Remy in sight . He ’s just so dang cute . And he only poops or cries when West is watching him , which means he ’s basically the world ’s best baby . Three cats streak by as I make my way up the stairs to the guest wing of the house . I ’ve named them Cotton Ball , Snickers , and Mr. Peabody , and I ’m reasonably confident they ’ll be permanent fixtures here , along with Elvira , who ’s chilling in the pool on a unicorn floatie again . “
44355	44386	44387	44387	You	1193	” I call as I make my way down the hallway and its row of arched windows overlooking the mangroves surrounding the hump in the D part of my house . “
44391	44549	44387	44387	You	1193	” A muffled curse answers me from the Bahama Mama suite , so I backtrack to the mellow peach - and - yellow suite decorated with sunset pictures I ’ve shot off my yacht in the Bahamas . Naturally . The furniture is a vintage Queen Anne set that I had reupholstered with a pineapple patterned fabric , and the chandelier in the sitting room in here is my favorite — it ’s a blown glass oversized drink umbrella lined with color - changing LEDs that rotate from orange to yellow to pink to orange . I spent a fuck - ton of money to win that at an auction a couple months ago , along with a jewel - encrusted giraffe that I keep in one of my lounges . My friends thought I was crazy , but they love that about me . Even Remy stops to stare up at it when we walk in . “
44552	44565	44387	44387	You	1193	” he coos like the adorable perfect little baby that he is . “
44568	44585	44387	44387	You	1193	” I agree . He grins . I grin back . Like we ’re actually communicating . “
44589	44630	44387	44387	You	1193	” West grunts deeper in the suite . I follow his voice to the bedroom , where I find a picture - perfect view of his ass in black mesh shorts while he bends over and reaches under the bed . “
44639	44643	44644	44644	Aaaooooo	253	” he says . “
44646	44668	44644	44644	Aaaooooo	253	” Remy says again . I coo back at him again and finagle us up onto the bed , then bounce . “
44671	44779	44780	44781	That cat	1195	” West hollers . A streak of black and white darts out of the room with a yowl , and my co - guardian sits back on his heels and gives me another of those looks he ’s gotten so good at . This one ’s a green - eyed glare . I am fascinated by his eyes . Mine change color because of my contacts — non - prescription , just for fun — but his , I ’m certain , are a reflection of his mood . On any other man I ’d call them hazel with personality . On him , they ’re magic . “
44792	44797	44780	44781	That cat	1195	” he informs me . “
44808	44818	44800	44800	We	1197	” He shoves his fists into his eye sockets . “
44834	44863	44827	44827	He	1195	” I know , and I ’ve already made a mental note to call the vet who sometimes checks in on Steve and ask for a house call . “
44870	44871	44872	44872	You	1199	” “
44880	44881	44882	44882	I	2293	” “
44889	44890	44891	44891	I	2293	” “
44912	44913	44899	44899	I	2293	” “
44920	44921	44899	44899	I	2293	” “
44935	44936	44899	44899	I	2293	” “
44949	44950	44938	44938	you	1199	” “
44953	44954	44938	44938	you	1199	” “
44985	45422	44980	44980	Becca	1346	” He mutters something about being a martyr and hoping Julienne and Rafe are rotting in hell — at least , that ’s my interpretation — while he shoves to his feet and stalks toward the door . Remy and I join him . Cam , Emily , and Luna are all busy today either having sexytimes with their soulmates or saving the world at charity events . My housekeeper and personal assistant do n’t work on Sundays . Neither does the pool boy , who ’s actually a woman who runs Pool Boy Maintenance — she mostly hires eye candy to service rich cougars in the area , but I get her personally , since she ’s freaking awesome and can handle everything from unbalanced pool pH to rescuing armadillos that fall in the pool , which only happened that one time in the dick pool , but I was still grateful . I could grab Alessandro and head to the village , but my face has n’t yet recovered from that theoretical boxing match with a lobster , so I ’m homebound . West turns into the Strawberry Daiquiri suite , which is his assigned bedroom suite for the duration of his stay . It does n’t look lived in at all , despite all the stuff he brought over yesterday . Clearly his Marine training is still with him . Or maybe he ’s plotting an escape from the room that Alessandro says has Pepto Bismol - colored walls . Yes , yes , I should ’ve given him the Piña Colada suite . It ’s much more masculine with its off - white walls and coconut chairs . But that would n’t have been as much fun as pushing his buttons . You do n’t really know a person until you know them under stress . And since I ’m going to be living with him for a while , I really should know how he handles stress . It ’s for the good of the baby . Seriously . Also , I have a very good feel for when I ’ve pushed someone too far after years of walking the line with my grandmother . Plus , knowing what stresses a person out helps me figure out how to do them favors that are better than arranging super - awkward group dates where I have allergic reactions to seafood . So far , the only favor I can see that West needs is alone time , which is n’t helping me figure out how to really pay him back at all . “
45433	45444	45445	45445	I	2293	” he says when we follow him into the suite . “
45450	45531	45445	45445	I	2293	” He swings around and looks me straight in the eye at that . I blink coquettishly . And his lips twitch . Just the briefest amount , but I made the big bad Marine construction guy smile . High fucking five to me . I ’ll dance about this later . Right now , I ’m not sure Remy ’s secure enough in this backwards backpack for me to risk it , which is unfortunate . I love dancing . “
45540	45545	45546	45546	I	2293	” I tell West . “
45553	45554	45546	45546	I	2293	” “
45560	45585	45586	45586	She	84	” He shoots . He scores . And I shudder before I catch on to the fact that he ’s razzing me right back . “
45655	45682	45649	45649	you	2293	” He studies me again the same way he did yesterday at the pool when I got back from my little field trip to the hospital . “
45690	45691	45649	45649	you	2293	” “
45713	45729	45649	45649	you	2293	” His lips flatten for a moment before he lifts his head to the ceiling . “
45732	45738	45649	45649	you	2293	” he mutters to himself . “
45747	45748	45649	45649	you	2293	” “
45854	45892	45835	45835	She	408	” He ’s shaking his head and muttering again as he heads into the walk - in closet . I follow , only to get treated to the sight of him pulling off his T - shirt . “
45901	45917	45895	45895	baby	598	” I breathe . He starts and turns around , and hello , even better . “
45927	45928	45895	45895	baby	598	” “
45944	46000	45940	45942	Bora - Bora	258	” Amongst all the ink on his chest , I move to touch the beach bungalow - and - mountain landscape on one pec between a mermaid masthead over his shoulder and what appears to be an intricate string of thorns and roses curving around his shoulder blade , but he swats my hand away . “
46004	46005	45940	45942	Bora - Bora	258	” “
46016	46017	46006	46006	I	2293	” “
46027	46031	46006	46006	I	2293	” I chuckle . “
46053	46054	46055	46055	I	2293	” “
46061	46062	46055	46055	I	2293	” “
46073	46074	46055	46055	I	2293	” “
46108	46276	46099	46099	They	1223	” He ’s right . I should go away . If I tell myself we can be friends who keep in touch after Remy ’s guardianship is no longer in question , I ’m lying , because I ca n’t be friends with a hard - bodied , competent , half - cranky , half - resigned , all - saving - my - ass former military man , because he ’s too fucking attractive for me to just be friends with . I know I do n’t need feelings about him . Just help . Preferably with a side of mutual respect , since I know a thing or two firsthand about the awkwardness of having parents who hate each other , though hopefully all the legal baloney will be over with long before Remy can remember any of this . But West does n’t like me , which is the other barrier to me being friends with him . And that ’s probably my fault . “
46333	46647	46311	46311	I	2293	” He turns his back to me and drops his pants , white briefs and all , and my mouth goes dry . He does not , in fact , have any tattoos on his ass . But he does have two solid marble orbs that end in tree trunk thighs that could probably squat my entire house . In my lifetime , I ’ve seen a healthy share of asses . Athlete asses . Movie star asses . Asses from every continent on earth , of all shapes , sizes , and colors . I could build an ass museum with all the asses I ’ve seen . But West Jaeger ’s ass tops them all . The thick muscly types do n’t usually do it for me — I’ve been in more of a mood for the slender starving rock star type lately — but I want to bend over and take a bite of one of those cheeks , and then trace every inch with both my tongue and my fingers . Even more than all the ink on his back , his bare ass is pure erotic artwork . That he ’s covering with board shorts . I whimper . He pulls a fresh white T - shirt over his dark , disheveled hair , and the tattoo disappears too . But I know it ’s there . And I wo n’t forget anytime soon . This is not good for my sanity . I shake my head as he bends over , grabs his dirty clothes , and places them carefully in a laundry hamper beneath the short row of folded and ironed jeans and T - shirts hanging on the lone rod in the closet . He irons his jeans . I ’m simultaneously turned on and appalled , and I ’m highly uncomfortable with both reactions . “
46653	46685	46311	46311	I	2293	” I manage to say nearly normally . He grabs his phone off the end table in the sitting room and walks out without answering me . Remy gurgles and coos . “
46688	46693	46694	46694	We	1225	” I tell him . “
46705	46730	46703	46703	we	1225	” Remy smiles . God , he ’s adorable . It ’s seriously hard to believe he ’s a product of Julienne and Rafe . “
46734	46740	46703	46703	we	1225	” I call to West . “
46779	46780	46771	46771	I	2293	” “
46793	46803	46771	46771	I	2293	” Yay ! He ’s talking to me again . “
46815	46816	46771	46771	I	2293	” “
46844	46845	46846	46846	I	2293	” “
46852	46857	46846	46846	I	2293	” I say quietly . “
46913	46921	46923	46923	you	1226	” He studies me for a moment . “
46925	46947	46923	46923	you	1226	” he says gruffly before turning back down the hall . Such a grumpy bear . He ’s so damn adorable . “
46993	47044	46988	46988	we	1234	” That stops him short in the middle of the hallway , with the early evening light shafting through the arched windows and illuminating him like an avenging beach angel . Oh , shi — shirt . The one time he takes me seriously , it ’s about getting married . “
47047	47092	46988	46988	we	1234	” I laugh , which is easy , because I do this laugh seventeen times an hour when I ’m partying with new acquaintances , which is basically every other weekend . He slowly turns to face me again , still lit and glowing . “
47100	47139	47140	47140	I	2293	” Does he have to do that thing where he crosses his muscled arms over his chest while he interrogates me ? Because I have a damn good air conditioning system , but I ’m starting to sweat . “
47142	47232	47140	47140	I	2293	” I have to stop and clear my throat . This is harder to say than I ’m sorry was . Why do I want Remy ? Because he ’s alone and helpless . Because he deserves a fucking awesome life . Because he ’s an orphan . Because he ’s my responsibility . Because my grandmother will disinherit me and yank away the only thing I ’ve ever been marginally good at if I do n’t take on this challenge too . But I ca n’t say that . “
47243	47248	47233	47233	You	2293	” he points out . “
47257	47258	47250	47250	you	2293	” “
47270	47282	47259	47259	I	2293	” I manage to say , just barely over a whisper . “
47302	47303	47259	47259	I	2293	” “
47314	47315	47259	47259	I	2293	” “
47367	47393	47394	47394	I	2293	” Heat is creeping over my scalp and down my neck . I ’ve been naked and felt less exposed than I do right now . “
47441	47442	47438	47438	you	2293	” “
47458	47487	47438	47438	you	2293	” I blink twice , because I ’m not sure what he means , but I think he just called me out on avoiding the question . Again . “
47504	47508	47502	47502	you	2293	” he says , “
47564	47578	47585	47587	someone a shithead	1243	” Shit . Am I swooning ? I think I ’m swooning again . “
47589	47590	47585	47587	someone a shithead	1243	” “
47602	47800	47585	47587	someone a shithead	1243	” I actually ca n’t argue with him . Also , I swear the man is getting sexier by the millisecond . And if that smirk as he turns and walks away again is any indication , he knows it . Nineteen West Confucius once said , there ’s nothing like feeling like an asshole to encourage a guy to try to rescue an idiot cat from a swimming pool . So maybe I ’m paraphrasing Confucius , but I do feel like an asshole for putting Daisy on the spot . It ’s not her fault I have a fucking hero complex . Not her fault her cousin married into a family of assholes and then named me in her will . And it ’s not her fault I said yes when she asked me to come back . That ’s all on me . So I need to quit taking it all out on her and make the most of being here . Nicely . Also , this damn cat does need to be rescued from the pool , since it stuck a claw through the pool floatie it ’s been chilling on since yesterday . “
47807	47811	47812	47812	You	1245	” I mutter . “
47835	47945	47812	47812	You	1245	” The gray tabby meow - squeals and prances in place on the deflating unicorn , which is not only wilting , but also taking on water , which the cat is freaking over . Apparently it does n’t like getting its paws wet . Or maybe it ’s terrified that whatever happened to the unicorn will happen to it . But when I wade closer in the four - foot - deep water in the middle of the D - shaped pool in the courtyard , it arches its back and hisses , its tail going fluffier than my sister ’s Pomeranian at the height of summer humidity . “
47972	48036	48081	48082	the baby	2188	” Another three minutes , and it ’ll be swimming for it , but this one seems to have enough demon in it that it could probably levitate to shore . I should leave it to its own devices , but if it ca n’t swim , I ’ll be the asshole who let a cat fall off a deflating unicorn and drown . “
48040	48078	48081	48082	the baby	2188	” a familiar voice calls . My shoulders bunch , and I order them to relax . Me being an ass to her wo n’t make any part of the next few weeks to months any easier . “
48084	48103	48104	48104	Steve	1187	” I try to keep my voice casual , but I do n’t know if I hit it . “
48109	48121	48122	48122	Steve	1187	” I twist around , not sure I heard her right . “
48127	48178	48122	48122	Steve	1187	” She laughs , and dammit . She ’s incapable of uttering a single true sentence , and here I am , wanting to actually laugh at both her audacity and the fact that I ’m sixty percent tempted to believe her . What the fuck is wrong with me ? “
48212	48312	48313	48313	You	1248	” Daisy plops down at the edge of the pool and dangles her feet in , watching me and the cat . While she was wearing the baby backpack backwards , all I could see was face and bare legs and tiger - striped toenails . Now I get the full view of her in a tight pink tank top and short white shorts . Her skin ’s still blotchy from yesterday ’s reaction , but her personality is back in order — not that it was missing long — so I ’m not worried over residual side effects . “
48321	48326	48327	48327	I	2293	” I ask her . “
48342	48343	48332	48333	The vet	1249	” “
48349	48350	48351	48351	I	2293	” “
48391	48546	48351	48351	I	2293	” She grins and winks . It bothers me how much I feel at home right now , because my sisters and Tyler would say the same . And how much I ’m not actually surprised that Daisy ’s taking care of the sick cat that I could n’t find . My nuts start singing some Barry Manilow , because they ’re hopelessly falling for Daisy ’s breasts . I remind my nuts that women like Barry White better , and they tell me I should pay better attention to who I ’m flirting with . Or trying not to flirt with . They might have a point . I ’ve nearly gotten the deflating unicorn to the opposite side of the pool with Demon Cat — aka Elvira , apparently — hissing and occasionally swatting at me from a distance . She ’s hissing and swatting at the water filling the floatie too . “
48556	48560	48351	48351	I	2293	” Daisy says . “
48573	48587	48351	48351	I	2293	” She sucks in half a breath before she leans back and laughs . “
48598	48749	48588	48589	Westley Jaeger	104	” I do n’t answer , because this seems like dangerous territory . Where I ’m comfortable to Becca , I ’m apparently passing some kind of test with Daisy , who ’s simultaneously unreliable and dependable at the same time . Which means she ’s faking one , and I do n’t like fake . I like real . I like rules . I like order . Therefore , I will not like Daisy Carter - Kincaid . I can be civil , but I do n’t have to like her . Do what you want , but we like her , my balls inform me . Traitors . I get the floatie lined up with the edge of the patio , but the cat keeps creeping further back , trying to climb the unicorn head , which is the only part not actively under an inch of water . “
48755	48795	48588	48589	Westley Jaeger	104	” I point to the fancy concrete surrounding the pool . The cat hisses and swipes again , but it miscalculates , because it ’s a fucking cat , and gets its claw stuck in the unicorn ’s horn . “
48801	48860	48588	48589	Westley Jaeger	104	” I mutter while it jerks its paw and tries to yank it out of the vinyl . But the bopping unicorn wo n’t give it up , so now the cat appears to be boxing a deflating unicorn head . Daisy tips her head back and laughs while whipping out a phone and pointing it at me . “
48874	48907	48588	48589	Westley Jaeger	104	” I jump out of the pool and drag the floatie out , but the damn cat is still fighting like it wants to stay in the pool and pulverize the unicorn . “
48926	49069	48588	48589	Westley Jaeger	104	” It finally wrenches its claw loose , the momentum throwing it into the water . I leap back in , but before I can reach it , it ’s scrambled out , a streak of soaking wet pussy flying into the landscaping like someone just shot it out of the clown cannon my mom bitched about for two years when that one comedian got popular for using it to avenge people terrified of ventriloquists by launching puppets at every show . She called it insulting the genre by splitting the fan base . Mocking each other is why we ca n’t have nice things . You can be funny without being mean . I had n’t understood , but eventually the cannon dude was arrested for tax fraud , so there ’s that . But back to Daisy and the cat . “
49074	49098	48588	48589	Westley Jaeger	104	” I call to her . She says something I do n’t hear clearly , so I tilt my good ear toward her . “
49105	49113	49114	49114	I	2293	” She sighs and splashes the water . “
49126	49127	49114	49114	I	2293	” “
49134	49135	49114	49114	I	2293	” “
49148	49158	49161	49162	my father	407	” I open my mouth . Then close it . “
49238	49271	49272	49272	I	2293	” Huh . She ’s flustered . I stand there watching her , testing a theory that she hates silence , and it ’s not three seconds before my patience is rewarded . “
49385	49469	49474	49474	him	1365	” That ’s reasonable . I do n’t think it ’s the full story on why she has n’t issued a single complaint about raising the baby beyond that first night , but it ’s a start . Yeah ! A start ! my balls crow . They ’re idiots . So am I , because my place here is n’t real . It ’s for show , for the lawyers and judges . Still , I do n’t look away from her . “
49484	49485	49488	49488	she	408	” “
49493	49499	49488	49488	she	408	” I cross my arms . “
49508	49509	49510	49510	Pinky	266	” “
49517	49693	49510	49510	Pinky	266	” She bends over her phone , and a minute later , she flashes the screen at me across the pool . I hear muffled voices , and I ca n’t see a damn thing on the screen , so I do something I ’ll probably regret , and I dive into the water to cross the pool . Quicker than walking around . Plus , I did n’t go into the Marines because I wanted to be stuck on land forever . I fucking love the water . I surface , and she ’s frowning at me . It ’s a subtle frown , her brows barely pinched , her pink lips straighter than turned down , but it ’s definitely a frown . She looks different without all her makeup on . Like a real woman . Not the one who ’s always on the magazines that my sisters keep when I ’m visiting home . And not just because her skin is still blotchy in places . But only a few places . “
49706	49707	49701	49701	her	1264	” “
49719	49723	49712	49712	she	1264	” Daisy grimaces . “
49732	49845	49712	49712	she	1264	” She lifts the phone again , and I lean closer to watch the video on the small screen . The scent of coconut floods my nose as I get within sniffing distance of Daisy , and I suddenly need to know what Sierra is doing . How big Baxter and Nina are now . If she ever got remarried . Noise off Daisy ’s phone reminds me to breathe , and there ’s another flash of weirdness in my chest as Julienne Carter - Roderick appears on the screen , stalking across the kitchen in her Coconut Grove mansion , wearing heels and a baby sling and talking to the camera . “
49908	49909	49897	49897	he	265	” “
49912	49913	49914	49914	She	1266	” “
50010	50026	50003	50003	we	1271	” I switch my attention from the video to her face . She blinks innocently . “
50045	50046	50037	50037	you	1275	” “
50070	50112	50114	50114	you	1275	” She ’s honestly incapable of being serious for three fucking seconds . And I ’m not nearly as annoyed by it as I should be . I stop when I realize I ’m subconsciously leaning toward her , nearly smiling . “
50121	50122	50114	50114	you	1275	” “
50176	50193	50155	50155	you	1275	” She gives me that grin again , shrugging her shoulders in a little oopsie move . “
50260	50261	50253	50258	people who do n’t deserve them	1280	” “
50283	50284	50271	50271	you	1275	” “
50287	50321	50322	50322	Friends	2184	” She loops her arms around my neck , much like she leaped on me for that kiss that I ca n’t erase off my lips , and she lowers her voice conspiratorially . “
50346	50357	50344	50344	you	1283	” I study her blue eyes , then slowly nod . “
50364	50424	50344	50344	you	1283	” She quirks another grin , and I realize she has tiny laugh lines at the corners of her eyes . She really does laugh all the time . Because she ’s happy ? Or because she ’s faking it ? But her attention drops to my wet T - shirt , and an uncharacteristic seriousness touches her gaze . “
50441	50442	50434	50434	I	2293	” “
50454	50460	50448	50448	your	1283	” She shakes her head . “
50530	50531	50527	50528	The Dame	408	” “
50539	50540	50527	50528	The Dame	408	” “
50554	50555	50556	50556	She	408	” “
50578	50688	50570	50572	No one else	1292	” Daisy tips her head back and laughs again , her arms still looped around my neck , and my cock twitches in interest . Again . Not . Good . Let go and get down with your bad self , my nuts chide . You ’re a grown - up . She ’s a grown - up . Do her and get her out of your system . I honestly do n’t know where I went wrong with my balls . She looks back at me , still smiling , and swear to fuck , she ’s even prettier now than she is when she ’s wearing makeup . “
50755	50756	50744	50744	They	1293	” “
50760	50769	50744	50744	They	1293	” She traces a finger down my neck . “
50844	50845	50846	50846	You	1297	” “
50853	50908	50846	50846	You	1297	” If she does n’t quit touching me , I ’m going to kiss her again , and we ’ll both regret it . No , check that . I ’ll regret it . I will definitely regret it . She grins , as if to reinforce the idea that she never regrets anything . “
50924	50925	50846	50846	You	1297	” “
50936	50937	50940	50941	my grandmother	380	” “
50954	51023	50940	50941	my grandmother	380	” She ’s so — so — so fucking infuriating . She wants my help , but she wo n’t tell me why . She smiles , but I do n’t believe she ’s fully happy . She says she wants to be nice , but she runs one of the biggest real estate empires in the world . You ca n’t run an empire and be nice . “
51035	51160	51026	51026	you	1297	” she whispers . She touches my neck again , and fuck . I ’m going to kiss her . I ’m going to kiss chaos . Disorder . Unpredictability . Because fuck it . If this is what life ’s throwing at me , why the hell should n’t I take it ? Twenty Daisy One minute , I ’m sitting on the edge of the pool , getting ready to kiss this delicious hunk of a man who ’s stepped up in a way no man has ever stepped up in my life , and the next , I ’m three feet underwater . I surge to the surface , ready to pounce , but West is already halfway across the pool . “
51172	51183	51026	51026	you	1297	” I call . He tilts his ear toward me . “
51224	51251	51258	51258	you	1297	” He ’s freaking hilarious . And unexpectedly fun this afternoon . And intent on resisting me , which makes him all that much more irresistible . “
51260	51331	51258	51258	you	1297	” I reach under the water and grab the bottom of my tank top to slowly peel it over my head . Even from halfway across the pool , I can see his eyes dilate . He ’s not immune to me . Not in the least . Is flirting with my co - guardian a bad idea ? Probably . But do I love bad ideas ? Most definitely . “
51336	51361	51362	51362	I	2293	” he says . The water ’s cool , but my skin ’s hot , and my competitive streak is bubbling to the surface . “
51373	51378	51362	51362	I	2293	” I tell him . “
51385	51430	51362	51362	I	2293	” I smile and fling my tank somewhere behind me . A cat yowls , and then a streak of gray tabby shoots from the bushes to the outdoor kitchen at the top of my courtyard . West wipes the water off his face . “
51440	51441	51431	51431	You	1297	” “
51445	51451	51431	51431	You	1297	” I wiggle my brows . “
51463	51464	51431	51431	You	1297	” “
51471	51472	51431	51431	You	1297	” “
51476	51477	51478	51478	You	1297	” “
51482	51483	51484	51484	Westley	104	” “
51497	51518	51490	51490	you	1297	” I reach behind my neck and untie my bikini top . He freezes in the water . Hard freezes . “
51524	51525	51490	51490	you	1297	” “
51529	51530	51490	51490	you	1297	” “
51557	51558	51553	51553	I	2293	” “
51586	51587	51572	51572	You	1297	” “
51609	51625	51607	51607	Daisy	155	” I glide into the water toward where he ’s hiding in the deep end . “
51638	51639	51626	51626	You	1297	” “
51660	51661	51662	51662	I	2293	” “
51681	51692	51662	51662	I	2293	” He slices through the water , effortlessly avoiding me . “
51703	51704	51705	51705	I	2293	” “
51729	51730	51722	51722	I	2293	” “
51746	51747	51738	51738	We	1309	” “
51754	51755	51749	51749	I	2293	” “
51758	51776	51749	51749	I	2293	” I laugh , because he ’s starting to smile , and I know he ’s lying . “
51790	51862	51778	51778	you	1297	” he adds , and that ’s it . He could be the love child of Michael Phelps and Idris Elba — so basically a gorgeous fast swimmer — and I would still absolutely catch this man and dunk him right back . I lunge for him , and he dives under the water , only to surface a moment later back in the shallow end of my awesome D pool . “
51866	51870	51871	51871	Pussy	270	” I call . “
51873	51953	51954	51954	You	1310	” he calls back with a full shit - eating grin that makes the butterflies and geckos and probably even Steve the alligator , who ca n’t see him , all faint with swooniness . I ’m torn between swooning and jumping him . But first , I need to be more aerodynamic . Aquadynamic ? Yeah . Aquadynamic . I reach under the water as my feet touch the bottom , and I wiggle out of my shorts . “
51967	51968	51969	51969	You	1310	” “
51971	52013	51969	51969	You	1310	” He stops and shakes his head , and I send my shorts flying back over my shoulder . No more cats yowl , but there ’s a crash and a crack , and West covers a grin with his hand . “
52022	52023	52014	52014	You	1310	” “
52054	52196	52197	52197	Daisy	155	” He ’s like a fish . One minute he ’s in the shallow end , then next he ’s halfway across the pool toward me . And despite my bravado , there ’s nothing I can do to make my milk jugs aquadynamic . And really , would I want to when a buff hottie like West is chasing me ? Still , I make a show of trying to swim away . Friends can bang , right ? We can bang out some stress , maybe have dinner together once or twice a week , and then we ’ll be much more friendly while all the legal crap gets sorted . He surfaces right next to me , and I shriek — for show , of course — and flap about helplessly trying half - heartedly to splash him . “
52199	52237	52197	52197	Daisy	155	” He shakes his head , treading water , droplets sluicing from his thick hair down his face , dripping off his nose , his eyes a mossy green that goes perfectly with the palm trees overhead . “
52256	52262	52263	52263	You	1312	” He sputters a laugh . “
52271	52272	52263	52263	You	1312	” “
52303	52352	52284	52284	I	2293	” I do n’t thrash about and pretend I ’m drowning , because that ’s one of my few other lines . Do n’t cry wolf when it matters . He ’s studying me , and the smile is sliding off his face . That wo n’t do . “
52393	52427	52385	52385	I	2293	” He does n’t smile this time . I do n’t know what just went through his head , but whatever it was , it ’s changed something . He suddenly looks away . “
52430	52459	52385	52385	I	2293	” I want to reach out and touch his face and turn it to me , but there ’s a back off shield going up in place again . “
52500	52514	52493	52493	I	2293	” My heart twists , and another unfamiliar emotion drags at my stomach . “
52528	52529	52493	52493	I	2293	” “
52537	52656	52493	52493	I	2293	” Ouch . Also , probably fair . He shoves away and dives back into the water . I should slip out of the pool and let him enjoy some laps and some sun while Remy ’s sleeping , but I do n’t do the walk of shame . Not after a one - night stand . And not after sticking my foot in my mouth . And not after accidentally pushing good men too far . But where I ’d usually do the walk of I live the fuck out of my life , and I enjoy every minute , instead , I stay in the pool , watching until he surfaces with his back to me . “
52660	52718	52493	52493	I	2293	” I blurt . His shoulders bunch . He ’s still in his white T - shirt , which is plastered to his body , not at all hiding the epic tattoos on his back . I want a closer look , to see what all he has inked there , but now ’s not the time . “
52956	53302	52945	52945	I	2293	” He hangs his head and rubs his temples , still without looking at me , and I know what he ’s thinking . If you want him to have a chance , then you need to get the fuck out of his life , because you ’re just as screwed up as the rest of your family . So maybe I can do the walk of shame . That ’s what it feels like as I slip mostly naked out of the pool and head back into my house without looking back . Twenty - One West After the pool incident , Daisy emails me with an updated proposed schedule for Remy that includes her taking the majority of the responsibility for him . She ’d take it all , she says , but for the legal challenge sake , I need to actually show evidence of taking some responsibility for him . She ends with a brief apology for making me uncomfortable . It ’s oddly human . And I do n’t mean I do n’t think Daisy ’s human . I think she ’s the biggest kind of human — big personality , big bank account , big sex account . Fuck . She ’s like a female Tyler , except bigger . And weirdly more professional . Did n’t see that coming . And I do n’t know if she ’s proving she can be professional , or if she had her assistant write it out for her , or if she ’s proving a point that she ’s not just a chaotic hornball . But Monday morning , when I leave the Pepto Bismol room that I ’ve been assigned and take Remy to her in her office , she ’s typing away at a computer in neon pink reading glasses that remind me of the 1960s . Her shoulders are bare , because she ’s in one of those shirts that has sleeves attached under her armpits . It ’s pink and skintight , but her cleavage is covered . “
53312	53320	53306	53306	You	1335	” She lifts a small crystal bowl . “
53324	53325	53306	53306	You	1335	” “
53331	53369	53306	53306	You	1335	” She peels off the reading glasses , tosses her bright , unnaturally red hair , and takes a bite while her eyes slide shut and a blissful smile slides over her lips . She visibly swallows . “
53377	53491	53306	53306	You	1335	” And then she rises to show off skintight , silver glitter pants . And when she crosses around her desk , my nuts start drooling . Can we slather her in froyo and then fuck her while she ’s wearing those strappy stilettos ? they want to know . I tell them to shut the fuck up , because she ’s like this for everyone . Whether she knows she ’s capable of lifting a thousand flagpoles with one lick of her tongue on a frozen yogurt spoon , and if she does it on purpose for fun , I have no idea . But my flagpole needs to stand at ease . “
53506	53507	53306	53306	You	1335	” “
53539	53549	53532	53535	our little handsome man	1339	” Remy yawns and waves a fist at her . “
53558	53562	53564	53566	a good boy	2730	” I report . “
53568	53661	53564	53566	a good boy	2730	” She bends over , giving me another whiff of coconut - scented Daisy , along with something fruity . She ’s a tropical bundle of chaos and unpredictability , but she ’s also something more . The byproduct of a divorce that affected her more than she wants to admit , if that flash of panic and pain on her face yesterday afternoon was any indication . Does n’t matter how much money a person has . Ca n’t stop a heart from hurting . She straightens and smiles at me . “
53707	53769	53772	53772	I	2293	” I nod . And hesitate in handing him over , holding him close instead of moving toward her outstretched arms , because I do n’t like what I need to do today . Namely , leave . Not a good sign . Do n’t get attached . Do n’t get attached . Do n’t get fucking attached , you idiot . “
53776	53786	53772	53772	I	2293	” I trail off , gesturing to the door . “
53793	53817	53772	53772	I	2293	” She bends over him , trying to take him again , but once more , I ca n’t quite let him go . “
53832	53838	53825	53825	I	2293	” Remy coos at her . “
53888	53889	53881	53881	we	1344	” “
53896	53971	53977	53977	dude	1346	” As I ’m about to finally surrender the baby , his lips part , then twist . His eyeballs cross , and a moment later , an unmistakable sound explodes from beneath his butt that I can feel clearly in the palm of my hand . He shifts like he ’s really grinding into it , and another butt - plosion rockets against my hand . Daisy freezes , but she also grins . “
53992	53993	53994	53994	He	1346	” “
54000	54001	53994	53994	He	1346	” “
54033	54056	54022	54022	he	1346	” She circles her hand around her office , and I notice the paperweight on her desk is also a crystal penis . “
54065	54077	54022	54022	he	1346	” I put my finger on the tip of my nose . “
54080	54084	54022	54022	he	1346	” she declares . “
54092	54093	54022	54022	he	1346	” “
54097	54101	54022	54022	he	1346	” I reply . “
54105	54146	54147	54147	He	1346	” Shit . Now I ’m being a shithead . But if she ’s serious — if she wants to raise this baby — then it ’s about time she gets a real taste for what she ’s in for . “
54159	54160	54154	54154	I	2293	” “
54165	54218	54220	54220	I	2293	” Her lip curls and her nose wrinkles as the scent of a baby ’s finest byproduct finally hits her . I still have n’t taken my finger off my nose , because this is a time - honored Jaeger tradition that started when my first niece was born thirteen years ago . “
54226	54227	54220	54220	I	2293	” “
54236	54262	54220	54220	I	2293	” She flies to the window and flings it open , waving a hand as the cool breeze off the ocean rolls into the room . “
54276	54334	54220	54220	I	2293	” She ’s still fanning her nose , her eyes — which are a brilliant green today — wide and twitching at the edges . Either she ’s trying to force them into submission to telegraph that she has this under control , or the scent coming out of Remy ’s diaper is about to kill her . “
54339	54351	54352	54352	He	1350	” She inhales , coughs , and fans her face again . “
54389	54407	54408	54408	My	2293	” Despite not wanting to , I grin . I ca n’t not . She ’s hilarious . “
54420	54421	54408	54408	My	2293	” “
54467	54477	54465	54465	sir	86	” Utterly outrageous . I choke back a laugh . “
54487	54496	54483	54483	You	1115	” She straightens and squares her bare shoulders . “
54504	54681	54501	54501	him	86	” In those stilettos , she ’s almost as high as my chest . There ’s no evidence of the lingering rash from her seafood reaction the other day , which either means she has killer makeup , or she has magic fast - healing skin . She ’s also really fucking hot when she ’s marching into battle . We ’ll slay for you , your holy sexiness , my balls crow . She leans into me again , her hands brushing my arm and chest . My cock twitches . My mouth goes dry . And no amount of foul diaper in the world could keep me from wanting to touch her cheeks to see if they ’re as soft as they look . But she ’s off - limits . I told her so , and she ’s not trying to hit on me this morning , and the only reason she ’s next to me is to pick up Remy . Whom she ’s pulling close despite the diaper that ’s overflowing . “
54697	54760	54693	54693	you	1356	” Fuck . I ’m dismissed . By a woman who ’s braving the diaper of doom , which is the last thing I ’d expect from the Daisy Carter - Kincaid of the tabloids . This woman — she has more layers than I want to admit . Than I should admit . I brush a thumb over Remy ’s forehead . “
54771	54874	54768	54769	Aunt Daisy	1115	” Leaving is the hardest fucking thing I ’ve ever done . But I have to . Noooooo , my nuts wail as I head out to my truck . I need to get over and check on the beach house , plus grab a few more things before hitting the gym for what will likely be my last week on the job there . My phone rings as I ’m firing up the engine . I ’ve been ignoring most of the family group texts — other than to reiterate that none of my family should fly down , that we need “
54878	54925	54970	54971	a bitch	1359	” before they invade — but I ca n’t ignore phone calls . And though there ’s over a decade between Tyler and me , he ’s still the only brother I have . I answer through the truck ’s speaker system and hit the road . “
54934	54935	54970	54971	a bitch	1359	” “
54943	54948	54970	54971	a bitch	1359	” he replies happily . “
54973	54982	54970	54971	a bitch	1359	” I smile . Miss the little fucker . “
54987	54988	54984	54984	you	1357	” “
54998	54999	54995	54995	You	1357	” “
55003	55004	54995	54995	You	1357	” “
55014	55042	55007	55007	Becca	1346	” My shoulders hitch , but I make them relax and wave to a lady out for a jog along the perfectly landscaped Bluewater golf cart trail . “
55048	55101	55105	55105	her	1357	” There ’s a beat of silence . Does n’t take much to picture my little brother smothering a not - surprised laugh . Our sisters like to tell me I ’m romance novel fodder — but , West , usually it ’s the GIRL who has all kinds of bad dates . “
55107	55112	55105	55105	her	1357	” Ty finally says . “
55163	55164	55165	55165	I	2293	” “
55172	55239	55240	55240	Westley	104	” On purpose . She ’s hard to not like . Even when I ’m frustrated with her for any number of things , she ’s so — so — fun . If there was n’t the complication of Remy , I could honestly see myself letting loose and having fun with her . But ultimately , I want to settle down . She never will . “
55242	55243	55240	55240	Westley	104	” “
55251	55255	55240	55240	Westley	104	” I repeat . “

55498	55503	55496	55496	Mara	276	” he tosses out . “

55629	55663	55604	55604	she	155	” I ’m gripping the steering wheel too tight . The ocean view , the palm trees , the Miami skyline — none of it is soothing and tropical and relaxing right now . “

55849	57141	57144	57144	Grammykins	162	” Except all day , while I ’m working , I keep thinking about Remy . His wide yawn . The way his dark eyes cross as he ’s falling asleep on a bottle . The way he shouts when he waves his fist in front of his face , like he ’s telling it to go somewhere but ca n’t figure out where . Those moments when he stares into my eyes like he ’s trying to tell me something , and he wants me to confirm that he ’s right . And then I think about Daisy . Her legs wrapped around me . The smile on her face when she ’s talking to Remy or looking at him . Her confession about how she was raised , which was less about her parents and more about how it affected her . What would a woman with as big a personality as Daisy ’s do if she believed in love ? I shake my head , because it does n’t matter . What matters is that I ’m effectively a temporary babysitter for a woman who ’s emotionally unavailable . If I let myself believe anything more than that , I ’m going to get burned . Twenty - Two Daisy I am in so over my head . Remy cries for two hours straight after West leaves . He does n’t want a bottle . He does n’t want tummy time . He does n’t want to read a book or take a nap or rock or go in a baby carrier or the stroller or sit on my lap . It ’s not until I change his diaper again and see the red marks on his little waist that I realize I wrapped his diaper too tight around him , and I break down in tears knowing that I hurt him , which makes him sob harder too . We both get through it — him with a bottle , me with frozen yogurt since the baby books say you should n’t drink while alone with a baby — and I manage to get a little work done , as well as interview three nannies , none of whom I like . They ’re all perfectly lovely , but apparently I ’m having some control issues , and I ’m not ready to trust anyone else with my baby if I do n’t click immediately . Which is another conversation I need to have with myself . Or perhaps a therapist . Remy and I also do n’t get out to stroll through the village and visit with Steve the Alligator and see people , because I ’m weirdly too exhausted to contemplate packing up his stroller and how I ’ll handle it if he poops in public . Also , he spends the last two hours of the evening fighting a bottle , then fighting a nap , and generally wailing his heart out . Lucinda comes in to check on us , points out that the nipple ’s plugged on the bottle , tells me I ’m doing a good job , and disappears like perhaps my grandmother has threatened to fire her on my behalf if she does n’t make me learn this motherhood thing myself . I ’m going to freaking put a wooden stake through her heart and end this undead hypnotizer of the world thing she has going on . When West gets back early evening , I somehow find it in me to force a smile and tell him we had the most fabulous day together , and wait until he sees what Remy picked out during our shopping spree . Which did n’t happen , but it ’s what West expects to hear , right ? Plus , it makes me sound like a vapid shopaholic with no redeeming qualities , which I ’m sure helps him immensely since he ’s tilting his head the way he does when he ’s concentrating and looking at me like he ’s concerned about me as a person , and we ca n’t have that . He and I need to get along on superficial terms . Not on Are you okay ? terms . Are you okay ? terms are dangerous for the heart . And connections . And he ’s made it clear I ’m not welcome in the heart region . Fine by me . I do n’t let anyone in my heart region either . He was completely and totally right when he said we needed to not get involved , and I owe him this much . Besides , I have a bigger issue to worry about . Namely , how the fuck I ’m going to actually do this mothering thing . As soon as West and Remy disappear , I fly up the stairs to my room and change into body armor . Also known as my ivory business suit . I hate the ivory business suit . It ’s so … so … so much like what The Dame wears every day . But it ’s necessary . So are the pearls . The diamond brooch from my paternal great - grandmother . The pantyhose . Pantyhose . I ’m wearing fucking pantyhose and the boring - ass please - don’t - ever - fuck - me pumps . Seriously . They ’re more effective than a chastity belt . I also call Emily and beg her for Derek to do my hair . She declines — politely , which of course I expected , since Derek only does her hair — but she also gets me an emergency last - minute appointment with Maxim , her other favorite stylist who ’s actually a real stylist , and not just a trained - at - home dude who uses his skills to seduce his woman . My friends ’ significant others are all super hot in super weird ways that I never would ’ve expected , and I love them all , which I can do , because it ’s friend - love , and not love - love . I take a selfie and send it to Cam — queen of the business suit , whose ass I will never be able to compete with — and she assures me that once I ’ve had my hair done , I ’ll look so professional that even the professionalist professional would n’t realize my favorite pastime is doing body shots off baseball players . I text Luna just because there ’s something about her that always makes me feel one with the earth , and I need to borrow some of her pure , awesome Luna energy . And two hours after I hand off Remy , I ’m strolling across the velvet carpet lining the marble floor of the high - windowed gallery in The Dame ’s castle — I mean home — toward her office in the east wing . Framed paintings of flamingoes , monkeys , crocodiles , and poodles — don’t ask — line the opposite wall and watch me like they know I ’m a total poser . You only have money because you have your family name behind you , the flamingo mocks . You ’re going to fail this baby test , the poodle sniffs . And here I thought I got lots of sleep last night . Maybe that ’s the problem . Maybe I need less sleep so the animals in the portraits wo n’t talk to me anymore . I knock once at the massive double doors then twist the wrought - iron handle . “
57151	57161	57162	57163	Miss Daisy	280	” Except my grandmother is n’t in her office . “
57165	57196	57197	57197	Barry	263	” One of her security team peeks into the room behind me , and I school my features behind one of my normal smiles , like everything ’s just fine . “
57206	57236	57203	57204	the baby	2188	” His dark face splits in a grin , and he whips out his phone to flip through a slideshow of the second most adorable baby on the planet . “
57248	57249	57250	57250	She	280	” “
57254	57255	57250	57250	She	280	” “
57274	57275	57265	57265	you	280	” “
57285	57359	57282	57283	Miss Daisy	280	” Oh , fuck . I forgot about Japan . And there goes a mini panic attack in my stomach . It feels like there ’s a jousting match going on between my liver and my appendix . I should be on that plane to Japan , because I ca n’t even change a diaper and feed a bottle right . How the fuck can I raise a baby ? Barry smiles knowingly . “
57379	57520	57373	57373	They	1391	” He claps a meaty hand to my shoulder and squeezes , and for a split second , I want to ask if he wants two babies . Which of course I wo n’t . Because there ’s another entirely different swell of panic rising at the thought of not seeing that gummy smile ever again . I ’m a total mess . And I need people . And work . And for someone else to hire a nanny . And preferably for me to not have to have West around to witness my complete and utter failure at this motherhood thing . Because I realized something today . My grandmother did n’t call me to chew me out about West telling her we were married . He ’s my grandmother ’s spy . I smile at the security guard . “
57538	57734	57737	57737	Remington	86	” I wink , he chuckles , and tells me to take my time and snag a nap here before I go home if I need it . I might actually need it , but more , I need to talk to my grandmother . It ’s a long drive back to my house . Alessandro , who normally keeps his cool during everything , flips off three drivers and cuts six more off in the horrible Miami traffic , like maybe he ’s channeling my mood . He tells me he ’s not getting the spy vibes off West , but he could be wrong . But finally , with just barely enough time before I ’m due for my next shift with Remy — god help me — we get back to my house . I dash to my office , double - check my game face , then I dial my grandmother ’s number for a video chat . She answers on the seventh ring . She ’s in her private jet , and she has the pursed - lip look of annoyance that should warn me not to push my luck . “
57739	57740	57737	57737	Remington	86	” “
57751	57752	57747	57749	Your favorite grandson	1395	” “
57771	57772	57762	57763	Mr. Jaeger	104	” “
57790	57791	57792	57792	I	2293	” “
57798	57892	57792	57792	I	2293	” I study her closely . She studies me right back . Something wrong is going on here . My grandmother does n’t get attached to people outside the family — not people she has n’t hand - picked herself , anyway — but while she was frosty as Antarctica in that video Tiana showed me of West facing her down the day I had my allergic reaction , she also has n’t ordered him out of my life . My grandmother is freaking playing me . And he probably is a spy . “
57912	57963	57904	57904	I	2293	” I have to . I need to . I ca n’t work from home and do my job effectively , and more , I ca n’t work here alone all day with a non - verbal dictator who ’s adorable and fascinating and perfect , but a dictator nonetheless . “
57966	57967	57968	57968	Granerella	282	” “
58030	58180	58016	58016	I	2293	” I ’m actually not , but I ’m not about to admit that to her . I get things done because people think I know what I ’m talking about . I do n’t . I ’m a total and complete fraud . I barely graduated high school . I only graduated college because my father made friends with half my professors and bribed them . And my grandmother only hired me into the family business because of a massive risk I took that could ’ve fallen apart at any second , but did n’t , mostly because she put her stamp of approval on it , thus negating any reason for anyone to fear I was bullshitting them . And now , she ’s studying me like I ’ve actually made a solid point . So I do what I always do , and I forge ahead . “
58252	58289	58236	58236	I	2293	” She leans back like she wants to cross her arms and glower at me , but her pupils dilate , and I know I ’ve got her . She fucking loves being on magazine covers . “
58300	58353	58354	58354	Babies	234	” she informs me . Dammit . That ’s the other thing I miss . But I ’ve been weirdly too busy to think about the mini - vacation in Bali that I ca n’t make anymore either , which is also a sign that my life is way out of whack . “
58358	58359	58354	58354	Babies	234	” “
58378	58389	58354	58354	Babies	234	” Oh . Fuck . Did n’t think about that . “
58419	58420	58421	58421	They	1411	” “
58427	58484	58421	58421	They	1411	” I bite my tongue , because Oh . Right . Because you would n’t either is probably not the best thing to say right now . Also , I sort of might have missed mentioning that part to West , and thank fuck he ’s not standing in my doorway overhearing this conversation right now . “
58491	58495	58485	58485	You	1408	” she adds . “
58499	58500	58501	58501	I	2293	” “
58520	58677	58511	58511	they	1411	” That , I know is true . I have n’t actually done the dealing in my grandmother ’s real estate company in several years . Instead , I ’ve empowered the people who work for me to do it in her name , and I just give them what they need to succeed . Whether that ’s a wall of frozen yogurt in the break room for morale , an ear to listen while they vent about a coworker or a project hitch , or a suggestion of which part of the real estate world we should conquer next — expanding from just office buildings to hotels , spas , and wineries was my idea , but implemented by my staff until they needed someone at the VP level to sign off — I’ve basically been the person making sure they all have what they need to get their jobs done . She frowns deeper . “
58762	58921	58751	58751	He	104	” I. Am . So . Fucked . No small part of me wants to flip her off and walk out the door . But … working for Carter International Properties is n’t just a job . It ’s the first thing I ’ve ever been proud of . I love having fun . Love partying . Love meeting new people . Love shopping and yachting and skydiving and skiing . But watching my employees utterly light up when a deal they ’ve worked so hard on all falls into place ? Being there when they tour a new hotel under construction and see firsthand what their hard work is leading to ? That ’s a part of my life I ca n’t see giving up either . And it ’s not like I can just walk into another real estate office and offer to be a vice president . Who would take me seriously ? No one . “
58924	58928	58751	58751	He	104	” I agree . “
58976	58977	58987	58987	Daisy	280	” “
59002	59104	59107	59107	He	1422	” I rarely wonder why my mother gave my grandmother the bird , walked away from her own inheritance , and went into penis art . It ’s pretty fucking obvious . Right now , I ’m tempted to flip her the bird myself . But seeing as I ca n’t even change a diaper right , I ’m in no position to pack Remy up and jet off to a private island where he can grow up wild and free to be whatever he wants . I hang up with the Graminator just as West knocks at my office door . “
59112	59115	59107	59107	He	1422	” Fuuuuuuck . “
59123	59147	59107	59107	He	1422	” He pins me with a look that says I ’ve lost my marbles , and possibly that he ’s insulted to boot . “
59154	59155	59156	59156	She	380	” “
59160	59161	59162	59162	I	2293	” “
59173	59240	59241	59241	You	1423	” It ’s not often I try not to laugh , but I have this horrible feeling that letting him see how amused I am by his joke is a terrible idea . I ca n’t see him working for my grandmother either , but I do honestly believe she likes him , which is the most disconcerting thought I ’ve had in my entire life . “
59244	59307	59241	59241	You	1423	” West asks . I reach for Remy , who ’s squirming and making that pinched - up face that suggests he ’s not happy about something , and it ’s now my job to determine exactly how to make him happy . I want to make you happy , baby Remy . I do … I just do n’t know how . “
59311	59316	59241	59241	You	1423	” I tell West . “
59323	60156	59241	59241	You	1423	” It ’s the weirdest truth . I did miss him . And I do n’t know how I ’m going to get through taking care of him all night tonight , but I ’ll make it or fake it . It ’s what I do . Twenty - Three West For the rest of the week , I only see Daisy at designated handoff times , which are usually first thing in the morning or right after office hours . She does n’t send Remy through any of her staff , but instead , delivers him to me herself with updates about how fussy he ’s been , how much formula he ’s had , when he last napped , and what new legal proceedings the Rodericks have started . By mid - week , I start to understand how she ’s so successful . There ’s not a single handoff where I do n’t feel like I ’m not getting the better end of the deal — even the handoff late Friday where she informs me that social services wants to schedule an appointment to make sure we ’re providing a safe , healthy environment for Remy — and she does it all with a smile that makes me feel like I ’ve just been blessed by the sun . I finish the gym renovation job , and I try to not obsess over the fact that I can not shake the image of her pulling off her wet tank top in the pool , while reminding myself that keeping things platonic between us is best for the baby . And for me . And for her . I have no idea if she obsesses over me while she ’s there , because I ca n’t read minds , and even if I could , I do n’t see her enough to try brain - reading . That ’s what we ’re doing . We ’re living together , but separately , because she asked me to be here to lend credibility to her mothering skills . It ’s fucked up , but we ’re falling into a routine , all while I remind myself not to get attached and somehow miss her all at the same time . My family texts every day for updates . Becca texts once to ask if there ’s anything else she can drop off for us . The Graminator — yes , I ’ve started calling her that too — drops by late Friday . Or so I ’m told by the housekeeper . Imogen Carter apparently does n’t want to see me any more than I want to see her , and the more I think about it , the weirder I feel about Daisy ’s assertion that Imogen likes me . Or her accusation that I ’d actually work for her grandmother . I ’m ignoring that and concentrating on what I need to do for Remy first . I swear he changes every day . He ’s smiling more . Cooing more . Pooping more . His legs are losing that bow - legged look that my sisters tell me is a side effect of being folded up in the womb for so many months before birth , and his thighs are starting to chunk out . His hair is thinning in back , where he lays on his head for fourteen hours a day . Daisy took him to the doctor after finding his medical records and discovering he was overdue for his two - month checkup . And shots . Fuck , that was a long night . Hell , it ’s a long week , and I ’m not even doing most of the parenting . Daisy is . Which is also dangerously attractive . Who would ’ve thought a partying heiress would take so well to instant motherhood ? But she does . And I ’m just going about my life trying to be nothing more than a guy enjoying a different beach house . I wake up Sunday morning to thunder outside and a perfunctory knock at the door . Shit . I overslept . And I told Daisy I ’d take Remy this morning because she has a date . The thought makes me growl way more than I have any right to as I leap up , quickly straightening the covers because old habits die hard , and I ’ve made my bed every day of my adult life . Basic training drilled it into me . Retirement does n’t mean I can let it go . But instead of Daisy , three men I recognize by reputation and folklore walk into my bedroom . The shortest of the three — who ’s still nearly as tall as I am — is carrying Remy . At least , I hope that ’s Remy , and not another child I ’ve unknowingly temporarily inherited . “
60165	60176	60161	60161	You	1426	” he says with hints of a clipped British accent . “
60181	60193	60161	60161	You	1426	” the blond tree trunk with a military buzz cut says . “
60197	60208	60209	60209	I	2293	” the blond tree trunk with the thick beard says . “
60216	60217	60218	60218	Gentlemen	2736	” “
60235	60265	60218	60218	Gentlemen	2736	” the dark - haired one holds the baby out to me . I reach for him automatically , and all three men put their fingers to their noses . “
60269	60283	60284	60284	He	2736	” I mutter , because I ’m trying to cuss less around Remy . “
60294	60299	60284	60284	He	2736	” the ringleader says . “
60319	60320	60321	60321	I	2293	” “
60331	60336	60321	60321	I	2293	” I say dryly . “
60347	60351	60352	60353	Beck Mason	288	” Beard says . “
60355	60367	60352	60353	Beck Mason	288	” Beck — he ’s the one who works with animals . “
60371	60372	60374	60374	Daisy	155	” “
60378	60379	60374	60374	Daisy	155	” “
60384	60398	60380	60380	I	2293	” The gray tabby — Elvira — sleeps on my bed most nights . “
60409	60410	60399	60399	You	1428	” “
60433	60458	60380	60380	I	2293	” That ’s Twinkle Toes . The previously puking cat that Daisy ’s housekeeper tells me is now on a special sensitive stomach diet . “
60469	60475	60476	60477	Jude Ellis	148	” Mysterious Military Man says . “
60485	60590	60476	60477	Jude Ellis	148	” I carry Remy to the changing table in the next room . Even though this is temporary , it ’s set up like it ’s permanent . Crib , changing table , baby swing , play mat — twin to everything Daisy has in her quarters . I tell myself it ’s where the nanny will eventually go , because I need to remind myself I ’m temporary . A few months , Daisy says . Maybe shorter if she gets enough positive press about what a great guardian she ’s become . The men all follow me into the baby ’s room . “
60596	60601	60591	60591	I	2293	” I tell them . “
60618	60619	60611	60611	we	1432	” “
60623	60628	60611	60611	we	1432	” Derek assures me . “
60637	60638	60611	60611	we	1432	” “
60645	60649	60611	60611	we	1432	” Jude adds . “
60664	60738	60611	60611	we	1432	” Beck chimes in . He does n’t blink . Or crack a grin . But he does crack a knuckle . I have a moment of honestly believing he can communicate with felines . And I do n’t trust Twinkle Toes to not tell lies about me . Shit . I need more sleep . I have n’t even been pulling most of the overnighters , but I still need more sleep . “
60749	60759	60611	60611	we	1432	” I ask while I prep for diaper duty . “
60784	60893	60777	60777	Daisy	155	” Derek says . Clearly the smooth - talker of the group , and this storyline of you ’ll be in Daisy ’s life for a while is making my shoulders hitch . Every day , I get a little more attached . Every day , I start to believe a little more that Daisy wants help . From me . Even when she ’s being perfectly cheerful and professional — not a word I would ’ve pinned to her that first night , or even the second — there ’s this look in her eyes . Like she ’s not entirely certain she ’s doing it right . “
60899	60903	60905	60905	her	155	” I ask . “
60935	60936	60937	60937	Your	1433	” “
60947	60948	60949	60949	She	155	” “
60955	60960	60949	60949	She	155	” Beck informs me . “
60970	60974	60949	60949	She	155	” Jude agrees . “
60982	60983	60976	60976	she	155	” “
60989	60990	60976	60976	she	155	” “
60998	60999	60976	60976	she	155	” “
61008	61020	61021	61021	She	155	” Derek says . All three of us look at him . “
61058	61059	61055	61056	showering companions	1443	” “
61074	61158	61159	61159	You	1444	” A week of diaper duty has made me a pro , so I ’m already picking Remy up off the table as I ask the question . Self - preservation . None of them will punch me for the question if I ’m holding a baby . But all three of them pause thoughtfully , as though it would n’t surprise them to find Daisy showering with any of their girlfriends , and they ’re not opposed to the idea of watching . “
61164	61174	61175	61175	You	1444	” I tell them . All three crack grins . “
61180	61184	61175	61175	You	1444	” Beck says . “
61199	61203	61216	61217	a cheeseburger	1446	” Derek muses . “
61212	61213	61216	61217	a cheeseburger	1446	” “
61219	61223	61216	61217	a cheeseburger	1446	” Beck agrees . “
61236	61240	61216	61217	a cheeseburger	1446	” Jude adds . “
61261	61334	61255	61255	Dot	291	” At least , as much as I can say of the story . Not really my place to rat her out to her friends if they want to believe I ’m the kind of guy who ’d stick around for eighteen years for a kid that I do n’t actually have a legit claim to . Except I ’m starting to think I would . Derek cocks a brow at me . “
61339	61340	61341	61341	She	291	” “
61348	61360	61361	61361	You	1444	” Beck asks . Jude folds his arms over his chest . “
61370	61374	61361	61361	You	1444	” I shrug . “
61387	61678	61361	61361	You	1444	” At least , in an ideal world I would n’t care . The truth is more complicated , and it involves asking these three the secret handshake to getting in on scaring the fuck out of anyone who ’d look at her wrong . I ’m no slouch . I still work out , because I ’m not old until Tyler can out - bench me , and I refuse to get old for at least forty more years . But I ’m also not stupid , nor am I the biggest guy in the room . Both Beck and Jude have some inches and some girth on me . In height and muscles . My cock can hold its own here , I ’m positive . Point is , I could probably not embarrass myself in an arm - wrestling match with any of them individually — including Derek — and I could handle any of Daisy ’s potential boyfriends just as well as they could , but four of us teaming up would weed out the real jackasses quick . And my blood pressure is hitting the roof at the idea of any jackass coming near Daisy . And by jackass , I basically mean anyone who has any intentions of getting her into bed for any reason . Male . Female . Rich . Poor . Secretly a serial killer . Volunteers for Doctors Without Borders or the Peace Corps . All jackasses who better not lay a fucking finger on her . Shit . I have a problem . I know better than to have a problem , but I ’m definitely developing a problem . All three of my morning guests grin at me . “
61687	61696	61697	61697	Gentlemen	2736	” Jude says . Beck nods in agreement . “
61721	61722	61723	61723	You	1449	” “
61728	61774	61723	61723	You	1449	” Remy tells me . Okay , not really . But he does give a loud coo that ends in a grin that ’s nearly identical to the three loony lovebirds cheering for my demise . A crack of thunder rumbles across the ground outside . “
61782	61786	61723	61723	You	1449	” Derek says . “
61825	61826	61817	61817	we	1450	” “
61829	61830	61831	61831	Daisy	155	” “
61836	61840	61842	61842	Cam	147	” Beck says . “
61844	61848	61842	61842	Cam	147	” Jude agrees . “
61865	61889	61857	61858	Crazy Daisy	292	” Baby or not , I have one hand wrapped around the giant ’s neck while I shove him against the nearest wall . “
61899	61917	61920	61920	he	1455	” I growl . He grins again . Beck snort - chuckles . Derek smooth - chuckles . “
61924	61928	61920	61920	he	1455	” Jude declares . “
61939	61956	61935	61935	he	1455	” He grabs my hand off his neck and twists my wrist until it almost snaps . “
61959	61981	61935	61935	he	1455	” I correct , and I sweep his feet out from under him , laying him out flat on the ground . “
62007	62038	62042	62043	the baby	2188	” These assholes are all still grinning . Jude leaps back to his feet and Beck shakes his head at all of us . Derek claps me on the shoulder . “
62087	62100	62081	62081	you	1458	” Well , fuck . That ’s actually a damn good offer . “
62103	62107	62081	62081	you	1458	” I ask . “
62111	62115	62081	62081	you	1458	” Beck says . “
62119	62120	62081	62081	you	1458	” “
62127	62152	62081	62081	you	1458	” Derek holds up a wallet , and — dammit . Fucker lifted my wallet . Jude grabs him by the collar and lifts . “
62157	62158	62081	62081	you	1458	” “
62169	62183	62189	62189	man	1362	” Now it ’s Beck ’s turn to clap me on the shoulder . “
62196	62304	62189	62189	man	1362	” Twenty - Four Daisy Mordecai ’s is blurry . Or maybe that ’s my eyes making the dimly - lit bistro seem fuzzy and glowy around the edges as Emily , Cam , and Luna steer me to our usual booth in the back . Normally it ’s shaped like a horseshoe . The booth , I mean . Not the whole bistro . Today , the horseshoe is a big blob that either looks like half a heart or a cocoon where I could happily curl up and pull a Sleeping Beauty , depending on which eye I use to look at it out of . “
62310	62465	62466	62466	Girl	1466	” I whisper to Luna while I scoot in deep so I can make sweet , sweet love — in the form of sleep — to the soft cushion . I think I whisper , anyway , but Lady Raquel , our favorite server for Drag Queen Brunch , whips around and looks me over . Today , she ’s in a sequined white jumpsuit and matching white platform boots , à la The King of Rock ’ n Roll , with her hair in a blue Marge Simpson ’ do that looks utterly fabulous on her . Rhinestones sparkle in both her ears and nose , and I suddenly want to hug her , but I ca n’t , because she has at least nine inches on me and my head would basically turn into a shelf for her fabulous boobs if I did . Plus , there ’s a table between us . “
62473	62477	62466	62466	Girl	1466	” she says . “
62527	62528	62529	62529	I	2293	” “
62544	62549	62550	62550	She	1466	” I tell her . “
62555	62559	62550	62550	She	1466	” Cam interrupts . “
62562	62566	62567	62567	I	2293	” I whine . “
62574	62575	62567	62567	I	2293	” “
62580	62584	62585	62585	I	2293	” Emily repeats . “
62595	62596	62585	62585	I	2293	” “
62601	62716	62585	62585	I	2293	” Luna pets my hair , which I may or may not have combed . I ca n’t remember . All I remember is Remy crying because I forgot to put the powdered formula in the bottle before I fed it to him , so he just got a bunch of water , which is apparently really bad for babies since they do n’t know when to stop drinking water , or so said one of those parenting books , but I ca n’t remember if it was the parenting book I believe or the parenting book that ’s full of bullshit . I ca n’t remember if I ’m being a bullshit parent . “
62723	62727	62728	62728	I	2293	” Emily asks . “
62824	62825	62826	62826	Your	2293	” “
62829	62833	62826	62826	Your	2293	” Emily asks . “
62838	62844	62826	62826	Your	2293	” Luna winks at me . “
62859	62860	62826	62826	Your	2293	” “
62863	62867	62826	62826	Your	2293	” Cam murmurs . “
62870	62874	62826	62826	Your	2293	” I ask . “
62901	62902	62889	62889	I’m	1470	” “
62907	62911	62889	62889	I’m	1470	” Luna agrees . “
62939	62940	62942	62942	he	1471	” “
62948	62952	62942	62942	he	1471	” Cam demands . “
63001	63002	63007	63007	he	1471	” “
63239	63240	63242	63242	I	2293	” “
63255	63259	63246	63246	her	380	” Luna whispers . “
63262	63444	63246	63246	her	380	” Emily hisses , and I bolt straight upright and open my eyelids as far as they ’ll go , because I know that shh . That shh means my second favorite part of Drag Queen Brunch has arrived in the form of four romance authors that we low - key stalk here every month . Related : I have a secret library full of all of their books , though I prefer to listen on audiobook , because I can do that on a plane , or in the car , or in the shower , or while I ’m pretending to be on a conference call when my grandmother pays her weekly visits to my office . Also related : my grandmother thinks I ’m working on a deal in Monaco with a man named Salvio who ’s having personal problems , but that ’s actually part of the one author ’s long - running series that I can not get enough of . Plus , Teddy Hamilton narrates the books , and his voice is to die for . “
63451	63467	63468	63468	I	2293	” the one in the taco shirt asks the one with the big blue glasses . “
63484	63488	63468	63468	I	2293	” she replies . “
63495	63518	63468	63468	I	2293	” the one in the stained unicorn shirt and sloppy half - bun says while they scoot into the booth beside us , “
63539	63669	63529	63530	a cunt	1483	” The other three romance authors that we eavesdrop on at Drag Queen Brunch for the last forever all suck in shocked breaths . My three friends and I all suck in shocked breaths . Even me . And I ’m hard to shock . But I ’m suddenly seeing my future . Remy , sitting down to dinner , asking if his penis is normal and what he ’s supposed to do if it stands up in the middle of him giving a presentation on elephants in sixth - grade science class . I somehow do n’t think own it , big guy will be the right answer . The woman in the Coffee is the answer T - shirt leans forward and grips unicorn author ’s hand . “
63677	63678	63679	63679	I	2293	” “
63688	63692	63679	63679	I	2293	” she wails . “
63709	63710	63699	63699	I	2293	” “
63726	63735	63711	63711	You	1484	” the author in the blue glasses says . “
63749	63756	63711	63711	You	1484	” the fourth author chimes in . “
63759	63765	63711	63711	You	1484	” I whisper to myself . “
63770	63809	63711	63711	You	1484	” Wait . I do n’t have this problem . There ’s very little I wo n’t say . I can even say — well , something that ’s not appropriate even for me at Drag Queen Brunch . “
63812	63816	63711	63711	You	1484	” Cam whispers . “
63835	63836	63828	63828	Jude	148	” “
63848	63852	63842	63842	Salvio	299	” I announce . “
63863	63882	63883	63883	Daisy	97	” Three sets of hands grab me before I can slide under the table and attack the authors . “
63921	63925	63911	63911	they	2324	” Emily hisses . “
63948	63949	63938	63938	We	1489	” “
64101	64105	64096	64097	The Dame	380	” Emily laughs . “
64131	64132	64124	64124	He	1496	” “
64220	64289	64290	64290	I	2293	” And not fuck up so badly that my grandmother takes him from me , fires me , and disowns me . I ’m not actually kidding that the thought of losing Remy is more important to me than the thought of being disinherited . I ’m starting to feel like someone to the little guy , but … it could all go away . In an instant . “
64315	64319	64290	64290	I	2293	” Cam offers . “
64333	64334	64321	64321	you	1510	” “
64339	64340	64321	64321	you	1510	” “
64351	64355	64321	64321	you	1510	” Luna says . “
64395	64396	64387	64387	they	2324	” “
64406	64531	64387	64387	they	2324	” Oh , hell . And now I ’m fighting a smile as my three friends crack up at the idea of raising Remy the Dog Man . Because they ’re right . We ’re going to get through this . They have my back , and they will , even after West leaves . My heart rolls over and pangs , because despite how little I ’ve seen him this last week , I like him . And not in a we should have a weekend fling in Bermuda kind of way . But in a he could be one of my closest friends , if I knew how to be real friends with anyone other than these three , kind of way . “
64544	64558	64533	64533	you	1513	” Emily says to Luna , and we all erupt in giggles again . “
64577	64629	64571	64571	you	1513	” I dive for my purse , my exhaustion forgotten as I remember the best part of parenting . The baby smiles . And Remy has the cutest baby smile . I ’m flashing photos on my phone when Lady Raquel returns with a round of pink drinks in margarita glasses . “
64633	64640	64571	64571	you	1513	” she whispers with a wink . “
64668	64669	64665	64666	a man	490	” “
64682	64687	64675	64675	Jude	148	” Cam sighs dreamily . “
64693	64697	64699	64699	Derek	2385	” Emily agrees . “
64719	64720	64707	64707	I	2293	” “
64732	64861	64724	64724	I	2293	” Luna ’s smile is so sappy and sweet that she manages to outshine Cam and Emily together , which is an impressive feat . It ’s not often I feel lonely with my friends , but they all have their someones . And I have a baby I barely feel competent with , a social worker coming soon to make sure he ’s safe since the Rodericks are calling both me and West unfit parents , pressure from my grandmother because Remy is all she has left of Julienne — yes , she ’s obnoxious , but she does care in her own way — and a very familiar tingling in my cooch and nips every time West knocks on my door with Remy for a handoff . “
64870	64874	64876	64876	he	1521	” I blurt . “
64943	64957	64958	64958	You	1526	” I leave out the part about our agreement that he ’s temporary . “
64977	64994	64972	64972	you	1526	” Lady Raquel says sagely . All four of the romance authors are leaning toward us . “
64998	65003	64972	64972	you	1526	” coffee lady whispers . “
65010	65021	64972	64972	you	1526	” Blue Glasses says loudly . Taco author nudges her . “
65024	65025	64972	64972	you	1526	” “
65033	65038	65039	65040	Lady Raquel	294	” the unicorn says . “
65050	65051	65042	65042	We	1530	” “
65055	65067	65042	65042	We	1530	” the taco author agrees as she pulls out a laptop . “
65076	65081	65042	65042	We	1530	” Luna tells me . “
65091	65092	65042	65042	We	1530	” “
65098	65168	65042	65042	We	1530	” We clink glasses . And I remember that I ’ve promised West I ’ll quit hitting on him , and just how screwed both Remy and I will be if he decides we ’re not worth it . And what ’s keeping him here ? Really ? A promise he made to a woman who did n’t deserve it . I owe him what he ’s asked for . “
65178	65184	65171	65171	Derek	2385	” I whisper to Emily . “
65270	65271	65259	65259	He	2385	” “
65274	65275	65259	65259	He	2385	” “
65286	65292	65293	65293	We	1536	” She squeezes my hand . “
65317	66491	65304	65304	You	1537	” I hope she ’s right . But for the first time in my life , I ’m actually worried that I ’m going to fail at something that matters . Twenty - Five West Thursday night , I hit every red light and traffic jam and rude driver in Miami on my way back to Bluewater from a small job in Coral Gables , which I was late to since Daisy ’s replacement house sitter for me found a leak in the bathroom sink of the beach house , and I had to fix that first thing this morning . The weather reports suggest a late - season tropical storm is forming in the Atlantic . And Becca is asking if she and the girls can come bring the baby a present this weekend , since diapers and formula do n’t really count . I weave through the picturesque Bluewater streets , trading waves with residents out for walks with their dogs or switching out the chalkboard signs outside their shops . Everything ’s bright and colorful and happy here , but I ’m so run down , I ca n’t appreciate it . Despite how familiar all the faces have become , from the women Daisy calls the Wealthy Widows , to Frank the cussing parrot and Steve the three - legged alligator , to her best friends ’ boyfriends and fiancé , this is n’t my world . It ’s Daisy ’s , and I ’m just trespassing temporarily until she ’s overcome the legal challenges presented so she can keep Remy . And getting more and more attached to the little guy every day . He found his hands this week . Spent hours watching himself flex his fists , then more hours trying to grab a parrot hanging on the play mat someone sent as a gift . Overall , he ’s a happy kid . And I fucking miss him . When I finally pull up to the D mansion , the sky is fading from dusky rose to deep purple over the palm trees . I was supposed to get Remy thirty minutes ago , and my phone has been blowing up in my cupholder the entire ride . I ’m already late , so I check the messages I ’ve missed . Mom : Westley , enough is enough . I ’m booking a flight to come see you . Tyler : Aw , Ma , you just want to soak up the Miami rays and have an excuse to hang around long enough to see me play there weekend after next , do n’t you ? Allie : Yeah , she wants to be there to hug you and tell you it ’s okay when you wipe out and lose . Keely : Solid burn ! Britney : Nice , but not productive . West , Mom ’s right . You ca n’t treat this like it ’s Sierra Part Two and you ’re trying not to get attached . You legally inherited a baby . You ’re retired and not moving . And even if god forbid something awful happens , WE’RE YOUR FUCKING FAMILY and you do n’t have to protect us . It ’s OUR job to protect YOU . Tyler : Wow . That was deep . Mom : I also read that Daisy Carter - Kincaid was caught getting trashed at a brunch the other day . Dad : I want to lick your pussy . Dad : Tyler is my favorite child . Dad : I AM GOING TO BANANA - RAMA - JAM - JAM YOU , Tyler is my favorite child . Allie : NICE on the text replacement prank , Mom . Mom : I have no idea what you ’re talking about . Tyler ’s always reprogramming your father ’s phone , not me . Westley , where are you ? Do I need to call ? Britney : He ’s probably stuck in Miami traffic . Or dead . Their drivers are worse than Chicago drivers . Mom : * gif of angry yelling cartoon mom * Dad : * gif of Tyler tripping and sliding on the ice into Ares Berger ’s ass * Britney : * gif of woman spitting drink * Allie : * gif of baby falling over laughing * Keely : * eye roll emoji * I ’m calling * dragon emoji * and we ’re booking tickets , because while you yahoos are having fun , WEST IS DEALING WITH A SERIOUS BABY ISSUE , and SOMEONE needs to be there for him . Mom : * gif of a chastised woman * Britney : * gif of cute cat asking for forgiveness * Allie : * gif of embarrassed dog saying sorry * Dad : * gif of an iguana farting in a bathtub * Dad : Whoops . That was supposed to be I AM NOT WORTHY TO LICK THE FEET OF THE GREAT MAY ELLA JAEGER . Dad : I AM NOT WORTHY TO LICK THE FEET OF THE GREAT MAY ELLA JAEGER . Dad : * middle finger emoji * The texts stop , and I realize I ’m sitting here half - smiling at my insane family , despite not wanting the reminder of Sierra nor all of them to come meet a baby that wo n’t be in my life long . But Keely ’s threat to call The Dragon , aka Staci , our non - texting sister , means things are serious . I shoot them a quick message telling them I have n’t died in Miami traffic , and that they should hold off on making plans until after the social worker comes to check us out next week . Who knows if Daisy will still need me after that ? Odds are good it ’ll go amazing , because Daisy ’s rocking this parenting thing , and the social worker will tell the judge that the will should stand as is . And then I ’ll be gone . My stomach dips . After another quick text to Daisy telling her I got stuck in traffic and I ’m on my way , I climb out of my truck and trudge up to the now - familiar huge oak double doors . I barely notice the curved glass staircase , the slate floor , the four cats that dash out to check on me , and the arched windows that I pass on my way to my bedroom . But I notice what ’s waiting for me in the sitting room . Daisy , leaning back in the round hot pink chair that vaguely resembles a strawberry , her feet propped up on the glass coffee table next to her phone , Remy resting against her thighs while he holds her thumbs and she covers his face with his fists , then pulls them away , whispering , “
66494	66846	65304	65304	You	1537	” and making him giggle , which in turn makes her giggle . Over . And over . And over . Her hair ’s light purple now . And shorter . And hanging loose around her face , which is only lightly covered with makeup . Mascara and lipstick and nothing else . She ’s in red stilettos , leopard - print leggings and a black tank top that do n’t go at all with Remy ’s little sailor outfit , and everything about this picture is so fucking natural that the damn muscle in my chest that I ’ve been keeping cooped up gives a big , loud , powerful thump . I never thought I ’d see the day when I ’d call purple hair and leopard print leggings natural , but on Daisy , they are . That ’s who she is . Bright . Unpredictable . Crazy . And just so Daisy . I swallow hard , because I ca n’t deny it anymore . She ’s not a vapid party girl . She ’s a smart businesswoman who works hard and plays hard and loves hard , no matter the wild front she puts out to the world . There ’s no faking that shine in her eyes when Remy giggles . It ’s the same shine I ’ve seen time and again on my sisters ’ faces when they ’ve brought home all their babies — the biological and the adopted . Love is n’t about blood . And blood is n’t always about love . But Daisy — she loves that baby . Not because she has to . But because how could she not ? Hell , who am I kidding ? I do n’t recognize the glow because of my sisters . I recognize the glow because of me . I ’m fucking glowing just watching the two of them . Standing here grinning like a sap . Getting a little choked up when she pulls his fists to her lips and kisses them . Yeah . I ’m a little attached . “
66859	66868	65304	65304	You	1537	” she coos . Remy shouts a big ol’ “
66871	66872	65304	65304	You	1537	” “
66890	66909	66877	66878	My Remy	1538	” My eyes get hot . She does n’t need me . She ’s got this . Fuck . “
66972	66978	66980	66980	I	2293	” I clear my throat . “
66986	66987	66980	66980	I	2293	” “
67033	67080	67031	67031	Peekaboo	306	” Remy squeals . Daisy laughs . And my heart twists and soars at the same time . This is a dangerous , dangerous path . But it ’s not one I can resist . It ’s not one I ’ve ever been able to resist . “
67094	67095	67089	67089	I	2293	” “
67117	67133	67140	67140	You	1540	” She boops Remy on the nose , he coos , and she laughs again . “
67146	67820	67140	67140	You	1540	” Her smile is the last thing I see before I step out of the sitting room , and it ’s making me hard as rebar . I tell myself it ’s just a side effect of seeing a woman with a baby — clearly , they ’re my kryptonite — but when I step in the shower , I ’m not picturing Daisy with Remy . I ’m picturing Daisy in the pool . Tossing her swimsuit top onto the cat . Draping her arms around me . Gripping my hips with her thighs . Christ . She ’s snuck into my brain , and I do n’t know how to get her out . We ca n’t get involved , because when it ends — and it will , because I ’m rules and straight lines , and she ’s chaos and heart - shaped bubbles floating in the sky — I’ll be facing the same path I ’ve walked too painfully before . I can walk away from a woman . I ca n’t walk away from a kid . Not again . Kids do n’t deserve to pay the price for adults not being able to work shit out . That ’s why I avoided Becca ’s kids before asking her if we could date . So none of us would get attached . I do n’t miss Sierra . Time heals wounds , and in retrospect , it ’s easy to see where the cracks were in our relationship . But her kids ? There ’s still a hole there . Nina would ’ve graduated eighth grade this past May . Baxter ’s probably taking his ACTs and SATs and talking about where to go to college . And it ’s none of my fucking business anymore , because all I was , was the man who dated their mother for two years . It did n’t matter how many times I picked them up from school . How many band concerts I went to . How many lines I helped rehearse for the school play . I was n’t their father . I was the guy who got orders across the country , and the guy who did n’t mean enough to their mother to justify uprooting everyone to go with me . Or even enough to wait for me . I was the one who left . My boner ’s creeping away on its own , which is good , because Daisy ’s the kind who ’d pop into the shower here , and the last thing I need is her catching me rubbing one out . She ’d think I was thinking about her . She ’d be right . And we ’d be headed for disaster . But there has to be a happy medium . A place where we can be friends , without being anything more . And since I told her to back the fuck off , it ’s up to me to set the stage to get us there . Ca n’t hurt . Especially with a social worker coming next week to make sure we ’re good parent material . Yep . We can be friends . We should be friends . This attraction ? It ’s a fluke because of stress , and the fact that Daisy is an attractive woman . It ’ll pass . And if it does n’t , I ’m still a Marine at heart . I ’ll fucking make it pass . Twenty - Six Daisy Remy ’s gnawing on a board book and looking sleepy when West emerges from the bathroom in gray sweatpants and a black Marines T - shirt that ’s hugging his chest in all the right places . I stifle a sigh that he ’s so intent on having nothing to do with me , because we really could both use some frustration relief , and he ’s sexy as fuck basically twenty - four hours a day . “
67825	67843	67140	67140	You	1540	” he asks gruffly . My mood goes from sad panda to leaping llama in a flash . “
67858	67928	67140	67140	You	1540	” And a donut from Carbs ’ n Coffee , because today was my monthly buy - everyone’s - coffee - and - donuts day , which did n’t feel like enough , so I also sent sub sandwich platters to all of Miami ’s elementary schools for the teacher lounges . His lips quirk again in more of a smile than I ’ve seen since he moved in . “
67939	67940	67929	67929	I	2293	” “
67954	67959	67929	67929	I	2293	” His nose wrinkles . “
67964	67965	67929	67929	I	2293	” “
67988	67989	67975	67975	I	2293	” “
67993	67994	67975	67975	I	2293	” “
68005	68006	67975	67975	I	2293	” “
68010	68011	68012	68013	Westley Jaeger	104	” “
68029	68039	68015	68015	you	104	” He drops his head with a wry grin . “
68059	68060	68065	68065	you	104	” “
68084	68093	68081	68081	I	2293	” I lift Remy and kiss his cheek . “
68115	68188	68097	68098	little man	1543	” He whimpers when I take the book away , but I pop a pacifier in his mouth , and he settles in with a hand resting on my boob and his forehead pressed to my neck as I stand . West ’s eyes pinch like he ’s in pain , but he turns and opens the door , gesturing us out , and whatever was there a minute ago is gone . “
68198	68314	68097	68098	little man	1543	” Lead I do . With an extra swing in my hips , while I toss questions back to him about how work ’s going , if he ’s explored Bluewater at all , and how bad Derek , Jude , and Beck ’s inquisition was of him on Sunday while I was off brunching and breaking down . Which I do n’t add , by the way , because he does n’t need to know that . Plus , I feel like I ’m getting my feet back under me , like I can do this . I ’m not surprised when he gives me short answers and turns the questions back to me . “
68323	68436	68097	68098	little man	1543	” he asks while he picks through my peanut butter collection in my bright , cheery kitchen . He ’s standing under copper pots and pans hanging from the ceiling over the white marble island , making quick work of dismissing the fancier peanut butters I ’ve laid out for the simpler organic crunchy versions . He does the same with the bread , passing over the rosemary focaccia in favor of cracked wheat — which even I ’ll admit makes sense — but when he pops open a bag of Lays and crumbles the plain potato chips over the layer of peanut butter on the bread , my eyes go wide . “
68442	68443	68097	68098	little man	1543	” “
68454	68455	68097	68098	little man	1543	” “
68464	68465	68097	68098	little man	1543	” “
68498	68499	68481	68481	I	2293	” “
68504	68524	68526	68526	I	2293	” Remy fusses on my shoulder , so I rise and bounce him until he drifts back to sleep . “
68543	68544	68530	68530	You	1550	” “
68550	68560	68530	68530	You	1550	” He lifts a jar of local honey too . “
68604	68722	68587	68590	Ms. Carter - Kincaid	153	” He ’s laughing at me now , which I ’ll allow , because he ’s fucking gorgeous when he lets that smile loose . Eyes crinkling . They ’re honey - brown tonight , and if licking eyeballs was a thing , I ’d be tempted . All of his dark stubble parts to reveal straight white teeth . Even his damp hair seems happy . And when he ’s smiling , his shoulders relax , his grip on the peanut butter knife loosens , and I get a glimpse at the man he could be if he ’d let go of whatever it is that ’s keeping him from embracing the beauty of the unexpected . “
68725	68729	68587	68590	Ms. Carter - Kincaid	153	” I declare . “
68743	68744	68737	68737	I	2293	” “
68763	68764	68765	68765	You	2293	” “
68769	69063	68765	68765	You	2293	” I hold out my free hand , and when he takes it to shake , a warm zing slides from my fingers to my elbows . Zings are bad news . Not when I ’m overseas , I mean . Zings signify solid potential for a fun fling when I ’m at least two thousand miles from home , operating under a fake name with no chance of my mother getting ideas or my date getting attached . But I ca n’t fling with West . Pretty sure he ’s an all - or - nothing man , and we need to get along for the social worker next week . Or at least prove we ’re independently capable of caring for a baby , along with not being dysfunctional when we ’re together . Especially since this is temporary . I drop his hand and grab one of his peanut butter abominations . I know , I know . Daisy , you ’ll do anything ! What ’s wrong with a peanut butter - potato chip sandwich ? I do n’t like my food to touch . Okay ? Gravy goes on potatoes and porterhouse , but not on the green beans . I chomp into the crime against peanut butter — I mean , the sandwich — fully intending to hate it , except … Huh . The salt and the honey work well together . And the crunch is — it ’s like crunchy peanut butter , except … dammit . Except better . I narrow my eyes . He smiles broader . My heart pounds a little faster . And I decide that if a pout will make him smile even bigger , then I ’ll do it . “
69070	69074	69064	69064	I	2293	” I sniff . “
69087	69118	69119	69119	Ha	311	” If he smiles any harder , he ’s going to break his cheeks . I flip my phone out of my cleavage and snap a pic before it disappears . “
69125	69126	69127	69127	Victories	313	” “
69133	69503	69504	69504	Daisy	1365	” He does n’t try to wrestle my phone away to delete the photo , but instead digs into his own sandwich . His eyes slide closed , and a different smile flits across his face . I wonder if that ’s what he looks like as he ’s drifting off to sleep after a sweaty romp in the sheets . Happy . Glowing . Satiated . I set the phone aside and grab a carrot stick from the vegetable tray we found in the fridge , chomp into it , and promptly inhale too quickly and choke . And not like fake - choke either . I ’m talking carrot lodged in my throat , dripping carrot crumbles into my lungs while I try to pound myself on the breast bone without hitting the baby . Oh , god . I ’m going to die . I ’m going to choke on a carrot and die before I get to see Remy grow up . He ’ll have to live with the heartbreak of knowing that every woman who ever tried to love him died too soon . One killed by horny dolphins . The other felled by a vegetable . I try to cough , and I ca n’t . My head is getting hot . My face is swelling . It ’s like the shrimp , but worse . Sixty zillion times worse . I ’ll be the vagillionaire heiress taken down by a carrot stick . My lungs burn . My knees shake . Oh , fuck , I ’m going to drop the baby . I am . I ’m dropping the baby . I try to tell West to catch him , but I ca n’t see past the haze of panic , and I ca n’t talk , and I — Something hard jolts my ribs once , twice , and on the third thrust , a half - eaten carrot flies out of my mouth . I gasp and hunch forward while the island countertop swims back into focus . My eyes are wet , my limbs are shaking , and there ’s a solid arm still wrapped around my waist . “
69513	69528	69508	69508	Fork	314	” A large , solid , warm hand rubs my back while I wheeze . “
69533	69534	69535	69535	Remy	1365	” “
69537	69711	69535	69535	Remy	1365	” I gasp out . The hand stops . The arm tenses . Oh , god . I dropped the baby and killed him . I choked on a carrot , and that sweet , innocent little bundle of smiles and baby poop is the one who paid the ultimate price . I dropped him on his head . I silenced him forever . I have blood on my hands . My wheeze turns into a sob , and I spin away from West , who should n’t touch me , because I ’m a murderer . My pulse ramps up so hot and hard that I go lightheaded and a scream forms deep inside my head , hollering just like Remy , like that precious little boy who will never scream again , because he’s — he’s — he ’s — Squirming on the island in front of me . Wailing . Flinging his hands around , his face beet red , his legs kicking one of his tiny socks right off . “
69717	69749	69750	69750	I	2293	” I gasp . I grab him and kiss his cheeks and lift him to look at him again while he squirms and wails and my eyes go hot and overflow . “
69815	69878	69879	69879	I	2293	” I ca n’t stop crying . The tears have started , and they wo n’t stop , and I ’m standing in my kitchen making promises to my little orphan boy that I ca n’t keep . I ca n’t promise him nothing bad will ever happen . That he ’ll always be safe . That I ’ll always be here . “
69883	69888	69889	69889	I	2293	” I choke out . “
69897	70064	69894	69895	sweet boy	598	” Two massive arms encircle us both , and I do n’t deserve them . I do n’t deserve West ’s warmth . I do n’t deserve Remy ’s smiles . I do n’t deserve peanut butter and potato chip sandwiches . I ’m a selfish asshole who parties too hard and pretends I do n’t do terrible things in business because I do it with a smile and promise people they ’ll be better off after they turn their buildings and land over to me , even if it ’s not always as true as I want it to be . And I do it all to make my grandmother happy , when the truth is , I ca n’t . No one can make her happy . Because you ca n’t make another person happy any more than I can promise Remy that I can see into the future to where we ’re all one big happy family without problems or pain or conflict . “
70067	70071	70072	70072	You	1552	” West says . “
70087	70088	70082	70082	You	1552	” “
70095	70099	70100	70100	I	2293	” I whimper . “
70184	70185	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” “
70188	70189	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” “
70192	70199	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” Warm lips brush my hair . “
70202	70354	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” he whispers . I should n’t trust him . I ’ve been burned by people I know a lot better , a lot harder . But all he ’s done is everything he never should ’ve been asked to do . I ’ll make this up to him . I will . I ’m Daisy Imogen fucking Carter - Kincaid . I can do anything . Apparently except parent a baby by myself without trying to self - destruct . Twenty - Seven West The rest of dinner is simultaneously more awkward than my failed date with Becca and almost as comfortable as a family picnic back home in Chicago , all while I do my fucking best to ignore that voice in my head whispering that there ’s more to Daisy Carter - Kincaid than maybe even she knows . And that I am truly in over my head . “
70361	70365	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” she asks . “
70368	70397	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” I reply , which sends her into a fit of giggles that ends with her coughing and me going tense and then her pointing to the bread . “
70402	70406	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” she orders . “
70415	70491	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” Bantering is so much easier than letting myself think about the panic in her voice when she thought she dropped the baby . She ’s got him . She does . She just needs the confidence to believe it , which is the last thing I ever would ’ve thought someone like Daisy could need . But it ’s all making sense . Big on the outside to shield the scared on the inside . “
70500	70504	70186	70186	Daisy	1365	” she orders . “
70519	70520	70510	70510	I	2293	” “
70531	70532	70510	70510	I	2293	” “
70596	70609	70593	70594	Mr. Pokey	316	” See ? Awkward and comfortable . All at the same time . “
70616	70752	70610	70610	You	2293	” I ask while I start making her another sandwich . On the second , I made the mistake of asking where she put all the food she was eating , and she grabbed her boobs , and I got a boner , which is another reason I ’m happy to keep making her sandwiches . It keeps the island between us as a boner - deterrent . And also to keep me from reaching for her to pull her into a hug , just because I think she needs it . But she ’s pretending she does n’t , so I ’ll pretend she does n’t too . She eyes me suspiciously , like she ’s not sure she should say what ’s on her mind , and then just blurts it all out . “

70831	70886	70829	70829	Carrot	317	” I hold up a carrot stick , and she chucks her metal water bottle at me . With the lid off . I duck easily , because she has awful aim , but I still get splashed with a flying arc of liquid when the bottle clangs to the tile floor behind me . “
70891	70895	70896	70896	I	2293	” She grins . “

71025	71056	70999	70999	you	1561	” I concede , though it does n’t feel like a concession , and I ’m actually smiling to myself at the thought of everything she might come up with . “
71079	71084	71088	71088	you	1561	” My shoulders hitch . “
71094	71095	71096	71096	I	2293	” “
71144	71185	71138	71138	you	1561	” I fold my arms over the wet spot on my T - shirt and try to glare at her , but it ’s harder than it would ’ve been before she choked . She sighs and rolls her eyes . “

71299	71331	71261	71261	I	2293	” Her cheeks go bright pink , and there ’s that overwhelming urge to hug her again . But it ’s accompanied by a need to google a therapist for her . “
71334	71341	71342	71342	I	2293	” She throws her hands up . “
71356	71437	71438	71439	Single mothers	2364	” I bite into a carrot and chew it slowly , watching the blush fade behind a growing scowl , like I ’m intentionally showing her how to eat a carrot without choking and she does n’t appreciate it . This is so much like being home . And I ’m also relieved her embarrassment is fading . She ’s welcome , though I ’ll probably never tell her so . I swallow and go back to fixing her sandwich . “

71936	71984	71900	71900	she	1590	” She ’s eyeballing me like she ’s not certain that was enough punishment , and that ’s exactly the problem . She cares about so much more than just herself . But she gets painted as nothing more than a fun - loving waste of oxygen . “
72001	72022	71900	71900	she	1590	” she asks . Huh . Did n’t realize I was doing it again . I tap my right ear . “
72037	72045	72048	72048	your	1594	” Her frown is n’t going away . “

72123	72164	72072	72072	Rarer	321	” And there goes the battle armor . It ’s subtle , but her blue eyes shift from the color of the sky to the color of flame , and the ever - present smile goes brittle at the edges . “
72170	72199	72168	72168	I	2293	” I gesture to the gourmet kitchen that opens to an outdoor kitchen by her pool , and by extension , the massive mansion we ’re standing in . “

72248	72299	72239	72239	Gramalicious	136	” I snort , because I do n’t believe for a minute that she does n’t work hard . Imogen Carter has disinherited too many people to play favorites for a hard - partying granddaughter who does n’t actually do anything at the office . She grins behind her sandwich . “
72372	72400	72402	72402	your	1601	” A red haze creeps into my vision . She pats my fist , which is clenching the knife so tight I could probably melt the metal . “

72499	72606	72453	72453	I	2293	” A week ago , this conversation would ’ve ended with me demanding to know if she took anything seriously . Pretty sure we ’ve covered that though , and I do n’t have a single doubt that she takes Remy seriously as a heart attack . And that she ’d do anything for him , and not just because she has the money to afford the world , but because she loves him . He ’s sleeping happily in a baby swing by the arched windows overlooking the gently - lit courtyard , completely oblivious to how freaked out she was just an hour ago . “
72612	72623	72453	72453	I	2293	” she says softly . I tap my right ear . “
72634	72666	72628	72628	I	2293	” That smile . Fuck . Yeah ! Ooh - rah ! Commence with the fucking ! my balls cheer . Swear to god , I ’m not related to them . “

73248	73387	73236	73236	He	2859	” She trails off with a shrug . Like she honestly thinks she could n’t do it on her own . I do n’t know much about the business of running an empire , but I know that anytime I walk into her office to trade off Remy , she ’s on the phone or on her computer . She makes phone calls to Japan in the middle of the night — yeah , he was up at three , but I was up anyway to talk to Tokyo — and the days she ’s gone to her office , she ’s taken night duty before and after since she ’s gone from seven AM to nine PM . Daisy ’s no lazy slouch . She works hard . And she ’s turning a sly grin my way . “
73424	73431	73433	73434	your grandmother	84	” And there ’s the distraction . “
73445	73446	73447	73447	She	84	” “

73531	73634	73518	73519	Party girl	1648	” I shake my head and screw the lid onto the peanut butter jar . Family ’s complicated . Mine are all relatively normal — yeah , Mom goes on tour and uses all of us as fodder for her stand - up routine , and my sisters all have their quirks , and Tyler ’s a special case all by himself — but none of us are so intimidated by any of the rest of us that we avoid conflict at all costs . Except Daisy does n’t avoid conflict with her grandmother . Not all the time . Just selectively . “
73647	73660	73635	73635	You	1650	” she says through a mouthful of peanut butter and chip sandwich . “
73666	73667	73668	73668	You	1650	” “
73671	73672	73674	73675	the master	1652	” “

73694	73722	73690	73690	You	1650	” She snort - laughs , and my heart stops for a half a second . We do n’t need choking part two tonight . Or ever . “
73725	73739	73690	73690	You	1650	” she tells me after she steals another drink of my root beer , “
73759	74291	73753	73754	big guy	2257	” I oblige the high five . And twenty minutes later , when she yawns and stretches , I reluctantly shoo her out of the kitchen and take over Remy duties . She ’s a mess . Nothing at all like the women I ’m usually attracted to . But every little nuance I discover in her personality makes me want to know more . And I can say as friends all I want , but I ’ve never been good at lying to myself . Twenty - Eight Daisy Unlike my highly organized vagillionaire friends , most mornings , I hit the snooze button until I ca n’t any longer , which inevitably results in me rushing through a shower , ignoring the clothes Tiana laid out for me the night before and grabbing something brighter or darker or shorter or longer depending on my mood . I spend thirty minutes too long on hair and makeup , which means Alessandro , Tiana , and I roll through Carbs ’ n Coffee on our way to the office for me to scarf down fried deliciousness and caffeine before I wreak havoc on the world . At least , ideally , that would be my usual morning . There ’s a lot less havoc - wreaking and a lot more fire - extinguishing — of the metaphorical variety — now that I ’m a responsible businessperson . I have n’t actually wreaked regular havoc in years , and now , as Remy ’s primary caretaker , I ’m even less inclined to leap up and light the world on fire . The good kind of fire , naturally . But this morning , I get up before my alarm goes off , because there ’s a ball of anxiety that ’s making sleep impossible . I need to be on my A - game for the social worker — especially since the Rodericks are now claiming I keep rabid animals on - site and that Remy ’s in immediate danger — so I surf the internet for random Go Fund Mes to donate a few million dollars to , then treat myself to some pampering before I have to be on for the day . I ’m stretched out in my zero - gravity water chamber in the home spa off my bedroom , cucumbers on my aching eyes , eucalyptus candles burning , audiobook playing softly . Technically , I should be meditating or soaking up the peace and tranquility of being in a sensory deprivation chamber , but I ’m actually hanging on to every word of Fake Royal Bride , this awesome romantic comedy written by the coffee author from Drag Queen Brunch . I snagged the audiobook as soon as I overheard that it was available with Teddy Hamilton narrating , because I clearly have a problem . Two , actually , because I suddenly realize I ’m not alone . I lift the lid and bolt upright , tossing the cucumbers aside and making salt water slosh onto the floor while Teddy narrates Rock Ludlow dirty - talking the innocent princess on their fake wedding night . “
74296	74297	73753	73754	big guy	2257	” “
74309	74329	73753	73754	big guy	2257	” comes a familiar voice from the bedroom as Rock asks if he can lick the princess ’s pussy . “
74341	74461	74336	74336	We	1657	” It takes me a minute of fumbling to shut off Teddy ’s voice and the princess suggesting she needs Rock to stroke his hard member while he eats her out , which would normally be fine , but West and I have been getting along amazingly well since the choking incident a week ago , sharing breakfast and dinner most days , and we even hung out together at the pool half the weekend , where I flirted with him without overtly flirting with him , and I think he actually flirted back . So I do n’t want him to think that all I ever think about is sex . Plus , he said the word problem . “
74468	74485	74487	74487	Remy	1365	” I throw on a sparkly unicorn robe for his sake and dart into my bedroom . “
74515	74572	74499	74500	my god	2229	” West lifts a single brow , telegraphing that I ’ve clearly lost my mind , and holds his phone out to me . Headlines assault my eyeballs . Playgirl Heiress Drops Baby On Head ! Daisy Carter - Kincaid ’s Nanny Tells All ! The DICK ’s New Marine Boy - Toy Actually A Woman ! “
74578	74582	74499	74500	my god	2229	” I ask . “
74586	74587	74588	74588	They	1661	” “
74595	74695	74588	74588	They	1661	” He ’s not breathing fire out his nose or stomping his foot like an angry bull , but I realize this calm façade is exactly that — a façade . His magic eyes are the color of pissed - off headstrong alpha male with all protective instincts activated , and it ’s making that omnipresent pull in my nether regions stronger this morning . I ’m debating between reminding him that his mom is a celebrity — anyone with a Netflix show qualifies in my book — and offering him use of my legal team when he continues . “
74699	74706	74588	74588	They	1661	” And now I ’m intrigued . “
74722	74844	74588	74588	They	1661	” I half - close one eye , tilt my head , and stick my tongue out and try to lick my nose while scrunching one cheek and shoving a finger into my ear . When I blink back to normal , he ’s closed his eyes and is taking a long , deep breath . Huh . He ’s not wearing a shirt . That ’s lovely . And it ’s a testament to how good of a friend and mother I am that I did n’t notice before now . Okay , I ’m lying . I noticed . I just did n’t get a chance to look closely at all the intricate inkwork until he closed his eyes . “
74848	74925	74928	74928	Remy	1365	” he grits out . Is he — oh . My . He is . He ’s sporting morning wood in those gray sweatpants while fuming about tabloid stories . Despite my best bad photo face . Or because of it ? The many facets of Westley Jaeger are fascinating . I snap my focus back to his face before he opens his eyes and claims this is my one chance to hit on him today . “
74930	74931	74928	74928	Remy	1365	” “
74937	75036	74928	74928	Remy	1365	” I fling open my balcony doors and step outside to drop into the fluffy butter - yellow love seat by the wide window overlooking Biscayne Bay and tuck my legs underneath me , then pat the cushion beside me where I ’d normally stretch my legs out . The ever - present sound of rolling waves greets me like an old friend , as does the scent of salt water and flowers . We ’re due for a nasty storm tonight — borderline tropical strength — and the wind ’s heavier , the sky darker than normal . “
75046	75052	75041	75041	I	2293	” He follows me out . “
75071	75087	75057	75057	Remy	1365	” If he does n’t stop talking , I ’m not going to stop swooning . “
75090	75204	75057	75057	Remy	1365	” He glares , but he sits . Glances around quickly . His eyes linger on my bed just inside the door , with the covers tossed willy - nilly everywhere behind the gauzy bed curtains because I am so not a make - your - bed type person . Which probably annoys the hell out of him , except when he snaps his face back to the bay , there ’s something more intriguing than irritation in the way his Adam ’s apple bobs . I shift on the love seat until I ’m right next to him , then go up on my knees and settle my hands on his shoulders . “
75213	75237	75057	75057	Remy	1365	” I knead my thumbs into the tight muscles , which tighten even harder before he gives up and lets his shoulders slump . “
75244	75249	75057	75057	Remy	1365	” he says gruffly . “
75282	75283	75284	75284	They	1666	” “
75299	75300	75284	75284	They	1666	” “
75344	75369	75327	75327	They	1666	” He does n’t reply . Possibly because I ’m digging my thumbs into a huge ball of tension behind his right shoulder blade . “
75397	75402	75403	75403	Tiny	326	” I inform him . “
75405	75406	75403	75403	Tiny	326	” “
75426	75427	75411	75411	She	1670	” “

75487	75488	75489	75489	Westley	104	” “
75522	75629	75631	75631	I	2293	” Oh , god . It could , could n’t it ? Will we lose Remy because I ’m allergic to shellfish ? Wait . No . That does n’t make sense . If being allergic disqualified you as a parent , then my mom could n’t be a parent either . Except her allergy developed as an adult too . Fuck . Fucksticks . Okay . Not going to worry about it . I knead deeper , because his head is lolling to one side , and one of us needs to be relaxed in a couple hours . It clearly wo n’t be me . “
75669	75670	75667	75667	you	1673	” “
75680	75681	75667	75667	you	1673	” “

75852	76045	76048	76048	worker	1675	” And that ’s exactly why no one ever thought I ’d succeed . Showed them , did n’t I ? Here I am . Succeeding . Behind my grandmother ’s name . Panicking over raising my cousin ’s baby . Going to the office every day because I ’m better at faking business than I am at faking mothering . Hashtag success . The social worker lady is going to see right through me and we are doomed . I was n’t actually kidding about living in a cardboard box out in the Everglades , and it ’s not because I do n’t own my house outright — I do — and it ’s not because I did n’t put a clause in my contract giving me twenty - five percent share in every property I help my grandmother develop — I did . It ’s because I ’ll be mortified when people discover the truth about me . West tilts his head back to look at me , and I dig a thumb deeper into that tight muscle in his shoulder . He grunts , and his eyes slide closed . “

76075	76290	76069	76071	the social worker	1480	” That earns me a smile . And it ’s one of those I - don’t - want - to - be - smiling - but - can’t - help - it smiles that makes my heart give a big ol’ fist pump . He lets his head fall forward again while I attack all the tension he ’s carrying , and I smile to myself . I ’ll win him over . Sooner or later . Probably sooner , because I ’m irresistible when I want to be . I like having him around . And not just because he ’s good with Remy . He ’s good with me . It ’s weird . What ’s weirder is that I like it . I do n’t actually want him to leave . Ever . Which is an extra weird feeling to have when I consider that we have n’t slept together . Not that I do n’t want to . My vibrator and my fingers have gotten quite the workouts lately with West ’s face and body as inspiration . Not that I ’ll tell him that , because I save my one inappropriate comment every day for things that I suspect will amuse him . The guy needs to relax more . “
76307	76319	76296	76296	I	2293	” I tell him , which helps calm me down too . “
76410	76508	76509	76509	Daisy	1365	” No one ’s taking Remy from me today . Another day , possibly , but not today . West , though ? They ’d never take him from West . He ’s a solid , dependable dreamboat , and I ’m honestly starting to wonder if my grandmother ’s plan is n’t to pay him to raise Remy , because he ’s the only reason I ’m semi - competent at taking care of the baby myself . Either he ’s inspiring me to not want to fail , or he ’s inadvertently teaching me something . “
76511	76538	76509	76509	Daisy	1365	” he says on a sigh . I knead deeper and wish I was n’t getting a lady hard - on from touching his bare skin . “
76541	76542	76509	76509	Daisy	1365	” “
76550	76551	76548	76548	you	1365	” “
76557	76569	76570	76570	You	1365	” He tilts his head back to look at me again . “
76580	76581	76570	76570	You	1365	” “
76591	76592	76584	76584	He	328	” “
76598	76599	76584	76584	He	328	” “
76614	76639	76584	76584	He	328	” His eyes are twinkling in the soft dawn light , pure green mischief , and oh my god , mischievous West is everything . “
76656	76679	76645	76645	I	2293	” He smiles at me , tilting his head back so I ’m looking at him upside down . I mock gasp . “
76712	77276	77277	77277	We	1688	” He has n’t shaved since he got here , and his beard is thick and dark , and I ca n’t resist stroking the rough growth . Holding his head so it ’s nestled against my breasts . Have I ever had a guy friend ? I do n’t think I have . And I like it . And I do n’t . I do n’t want to be his friend . I want to kiss him . I want to explore every inch of his body , trace his tattoos and caress the ridges of his muscles . I want to strip him out of his sweatpants and straddle him and ride him until we both fall off the cliff into satisfied oblivion . I drop my hands and start to move , because I promised I ’d respect his boundaries . I fucking hate boundaries . But I ’ll do this for him , because he ’s done so much for me , and my family , and I owe it to him to not push . Except when I start to shift away , he reaches behind us and settles his hands on my head , then tilts his face , and suddenly his lips are brushing mine , tasting like coffee and temptation , his rough beard tickling the sensitive skin around my mouth and sending my nerve endings into hyperdrive , and all of my good intentions fly out the window . This . This kiss is everything I should n’t want and ca n’t have , but fuck if I can stop myself . I slide a hand down his chest , and a low growl rumbles deep under my fingers before he pushes deeper into the kiss . Lips parting . Tongue tasting . His mouth claiming me like I ’m a gold - dusted caramel pistachio truffle that needs to be savored . I do n’t glide into kisses . I leap headfirst into the deep end without actually verifying it ’s the deep end , because I ’m into kissing because I like kissing , but more because I want the grand finale . I want to toss my clothes over the balcony and get hot and sweaty and see how many different paths I can take to the land of the grand O. But normally , I ’m seizing the moment before the moment ends . Before my weekend is over , before the party breaks up , before I have to go back to my normal life . West is my new normal . He ’s every moment . And this kiss — it ’s different but perfect . It ’s a hello , so that ’s who you are . It ’s a nice to meet you . It ’s a yes , actually , I do like you and I could spend all morning kissing you from every angle to learn what you like and what you do n’t . And right now , he seems to like pulling me into his lap so we can tackle this kiss head - on . Best way to tackle a problem , if you ask me . And it ’s definitely a problem that I have n’t yet been able to test for myself exactly what these bulgy biceps feel like . “
77281	77428	77429	77429	Daisy	1365	” he starts . He ’s going to say stop , and I do n’t want him to , so I rock in his lap against the hard ridge pressing into my hip . Seriously , just look at us getting along so well right now . We should kiss all the time . His grip tightens on my thigh , and I slip my tongue into his mouth , gliding against his while he groans and matches me stroke for stroke . A seagull swoops by with a cry that sounds like warning , warning ! , but I ignore it , because who wants a seagull warning when I ’m practically naked and he ’s showing off his morning salute and he ’s kissing me like he would ’ve died if I ’d died choking on that carrot last week ? He wrenches back . “
77431	77481	77429	77429	Daisy	1365	” Fuck . I sigh and drop my forehead to his shoulder . His nice , round , solid , dependable , highly - lickable shoulder that I ca n’t bite right now , because I know that tone . It ’s the we ca n’t do this tone . “
77484	77512	77429	77429	Daisy	1365	” I say , pretending I ’m not breathless and sorely disappointed in places I do n’t get disappointed — like that little muscle in my chest . “
77559	77607	77540	77540	she	1690	” Belatedly , I remember that getting out of the court system means he leaves . I plant a kiss on his neck as I slide off his lap , because I ca n’t help myself , and I do n’t want to think about him leaving . “
77616	78546	77540	77540	she	1690	” It ’s rare that I want to find my sanity . I prefer life without it . What ’s life without the fun ? But fun is n’t all I have to live for anymore . I have to be a responsible , dependable person , and it ’s not even that I ca n’t parent Remy alone . My grandmother could cut me off tomorrow , and I could give away ninety percent of my bank account and still die a rich woman . I can afford all the help in the world . But money ca n’t buy what I want from West more and more every day . He ’s figuring out my secrets . He ’s seen me choking , having allergic reactions , and falling in love with a baby . He ’s seeing me . And he ’s staying . I ca n’t deny Remy the opportunity to have that kind of dependable , family - is - what - you - make - it , people - are - more - than - their - accomplishments - and - bank - balance example in his life . Life is n’t simple . It ’s complicated and messy . No matter how much I try to believe that it ’s just a big party with a side of hard work to make the partying possible , there ’s still heartbreak and tough times and loneliness . All three of my very best friends in the entire universe have gone through hell this year . And all three of them have come out on top , and in love with amazing men to boot . But I do n’t do love . It lies . It cheats . And it hurts . So West and me ? We ’re going to be friends . Hopefully friends who are close enough that he ’ll agree to still be part of Remy ’s life after all the legal challenges are over . Part of my life . But only as friends . And that little voice inside me asking for more can shut the fuck up . Twenty - Nine West I do n’t know what happened in Daisy ’s room this morning with that kiss , but I know it wo n’t be the last time . Watching her panic last week , worrying she ’d hurt Remy — she was n’t faking . She loves him . And that changed everything . This past week , waking up in her house , seeing her every day , talking to her every day , joking with her , just hanging out with her — it ’s been a glimpse at a woman I very much want to know more . Falling for her now would be like falling into the same trap all over again . Single mother . Kid who does n’t have another solid father figure . Circumstances that make it seem right . And then it all gets blown to fucking hell . Even knowing how this will end ca n’t stop me from going in though . I do n’t know if she needs me , but I believe she wants me , and there ’s more power in want than in need . I ’ve never been someone ’s choice . I ’ve been their convenience . And I know that ’s how we started . She said as much . She needs me to make her look good . Except she does n’t , and nothing about this last week has been about putting on a show . It ’s just been two people coming to appreciate each other ’s quirks , strengths , and shortcomings . It ’s the kind of comfort I ’ve been craving . And the only thing missing is more of that kissing , which I should n’t do , but I ca n’t help myself . I want her . Plain and simple . But first , I need to convince the social worker that Daisy ’s a solid parent to Remy . Because once she does n’t need me , then we can both acknowledge what we actually want . I ’m pacing in the parlor at five minutes to ten , with two cats pacing behind me but no Daisy or Remy in sight yet . The room is at the center of the curve in the D , with party rooms off the wings on either side and a wall of windows overlooking the courtyard pool . A round indoor gas fireplace is inset in the center , with tropical plants decorating every nook and cranny around some fancy - ass furniture . Basically , it ’s a nightmare for a mobile baby . Fire . Poisonous plants . Bookshelves not screwed to the walls and decorated with glass and stoneware artwork that could cause a head injury . There ’s nothing childproofed in here at all — right down to me not knowing exactly how many cats we still have in the house , although the food bowls in the kitchen are always empty when I get up each morning , and this is where we ’ll be convincing a state official that we can be good parents . Not a problem , I tell myself . I ’m a fucking handyman . I can fix this . I eyeball the sunken couches and built - in gas firepit again . Probably . I can probably fix this . “
78557	78743	78551	78551	you	1694	” Daisy says suddenly . I turn to the sound of her voice , and what the ever - loving fuck ? She ’s in a fifties housewife dress , right down to the pantyhose with a seam up the back and discreet low - heeled shoes . Her purple hair is gone , and instead , it ’s brown and tied back in a simple bun . Her makeup is light and tasteful , and she ’s sweeping into the room with Remy in one arm and a stack of books tucked under the other . I swipe my hand over my eyes and look up at the ceiling two stories above , hoping to find some answers to this insane one - eighty in her appearance , but instead , I realize the chandelier overhead is shaped like a dick . It ’s a dick with dick pendants hanging from it . And … an artistic spurt coming out the tip . My jaw unhinges and my nuts crack up . I ’ve been here how many weeks and never noticed this before ? “
78757	78762	78747	78750	the social worker lady	3443	” Daisy says cheerfully . “
78787	78802	78784	78784	you	1698	” The clicking of her shoes against the Italian marble floor stops beside me . “
78824	78825	78811	78811	Tiana	380	” “
78829	78848	78811	78811	Tiana	380	” Daisy ’s assistant murmurs . I take one more deep breath , then look down at her . “
78854	78858	78851	78851	you	1698	” She grins . “
78915	78991	78996	78996	She	144	” Her cleavage is fully covered by the pink gingham dress , which goes all the way to her neck and flares down below her knees . She ’s wearing a light white cardigan over the whole ensemble , and I do n’t like it . It ’s not Daisy . Trumpets blare like a royal assembly is announcing the arrival of a king in a cartoon movie , and Daisy twirls toward the door . “
79000	79001	78996	78996	She	144	” “
79006	79010	78996	78996	She	144	” I ask . “
79013	79020	78996	78996	She	144	” Alessandro supplies with a grunt . “
79023	79056	79057	79057	I	2293	” he orders Daisy . She rolls her eyes — which are a soft brown now , matching her hair and making her seem as tame and harmless as a country mouse . “
79078	79084	79073	79073	I	2293	” she murmurs to me . “
79096	79097	79092	79092	You	2293	” “
79103	79108	79098	79098	I	2293	” I tell her . “
79113	79114	79098	79098	I	2293	” “
79125	79148	79123	79123	you	2293	” She grins , which is the only thing authentic about her , and turns her leg to show off the seam . “
79160	79161	79152	79152	You	2293	” “
79180	79243	79152	79152	You	2293	” She looks at the built - in fireplace , surrounded by a round couch inset in the floor as well , and frowns , then frowns at the baby , who scrunches up his face and lets loose in his diaper with a grunt that ’s drowned out by the trumpet in his butt that could out - trumpet her doorbell . “
79248	79283	79244	79246	Ms. Louise Anacosta	331	” Alessandro announces . Daisy and I both look up at the very stern woman in a business suit so buttoned - up she makes Daisy ’s housedress look like a Playboy Bunny outfit . “
79289	79296	79244	79246	Ms. Louise Anacosta	331	” Daisy whispers through a smile . “
79302	79322	79297	79300	Ms. Carter - Kincaid	153	” Tall , Skinny , and Scary says as she descends the two steps to the sunken sitting room . “
79327	79367	79297	79300	Ms. Carter - Kincaid	153	” I suddenly like Daisy ’s eyes more , because hers look like chocolate , whereas Ms. Anacosta ’s brown eyes look like judgmental holes to the hellmouth . This is going to be fun . I step forward . “
79376	79377	79297	79300	Ms. Carter - Kincaid	153	” “
79388	79389	79380	79382	the appointed guardian	1700	” “
79394	79395	79380	79382	the appointed guardian	1700	” “
79410	79411	79380	79382	the appointed guardian	1700	” “
79427	79434	79437	79437	Louise	331	” Daisy slides to my side . “
79450	79451	79443	79443	Remy	1365	” “
79462	79495	79452	79452	I	2293	” Louise replies in a way that makes me wonder if she ever got one - starred by Julienne for anything . But Daisy does n’t let the cold answer deter her . “
79504	79539	79542	79542	you	331	” Remy screws his face up again and grunts while he adds to the mess in his diaper . Louise peers down at him over her half - moon glasses , and she smiles . “
79547	79572	79576	79576	him	2293	” She ’s a completely different woman when she smiles , and I let out a breath I did n’t know I was holding . “
79578	79583	79576	79576	him	2293	” I tell Daisy . “
79599	79606	79589	79589	We	1705	” She smiles brighter at Louise . “
79634	79640	79623	79623	She	1708	“ No , thank you . ”
79737	79743	79744	79744	Louise	331	“ You change diapers yourself ? ”
79747	79761	79762	79762	Daisy	1365	“ Few times a day on workdays , few more on the weekend , ”
79766	79795	79796	79796	She	331	“ We ’ve gotten good at this in the last couple weeks , have n’t we , Remy ? Yes , we have . Yes , we have . ”
79816	79821	79822	79822	I	2293	“ Hates being dirty , ”
79826	79830	79831	79831	Daisy	1365	“ Abhors it , ”
79853	79865	79866	79866	Louise	331	“ Do you frequently change him on antique furniture without straps ? ”
79869	79905	79906	79906	Remy	1365	“ You ’d be amazed what you can convert into a changing table . It ’s so far to his room , and who wants to stew in his own poop any longer than necessary ? ”
80072	80081	80053	80053	Louise	331	“ How many animals reside in this house ? ”
80082	80092	80093	80093	Daisy	1365	“ About one for every five thousand square feet , ”
80105	80111	80114	80114	her	331	“ I ’ve got him , ”
80143	80166	80120	80120	She	331	“ Healthy kidneys . Bet that ’s not the first time a kid ’s gotten you on the job , is it ? ”
80167	80173	80174	80174	Louise	331	“ Not in the least , ”
80178	80186	80187	80187	Daisy	1365	“ He ’s never done that before , ”
80215	80232	80233	80233	I	2293	“ I ’ve gotten nailed by every one of my nephews at least six times each , ”
80237	80247	80248	80248	I	2293	“ And you were n’t going to tell me ? ”
80294	80304	80305	80305	Daisy	1365	“ I am so mad at you right now , ”
80340	80348	80335	80335	I	2293	“ Go on . Get cleaned up . ”
80458	80468	80469	80469	Daisy	1365	“ Can I show you the house , Louise ? ”
80473	80478	80469	80469	Daisy	1365	“ That would be — ”
80479	80503	80504	80504	I	2293	“ Daisy ! Daisy ! Oh , my poor baby , I ’m here ! Everything ’s fine ! Mama ’s here now ! ”
80584	80602	80603	80603	She	1719	“ Why did n’t you radio the yacht ? I would ’ve been here in an instant . ”
80637	80660	80626	80626	she	1719	“ I never prepared you for motherhood . I ’m a failure , and now I ’ve set you up for failure . ”
80661	80672	80626	80626	she	1719	“ Mom . Stop . You ’re not a failure . ”
80673	80679	80680	80680	I	2293	“ Daisy ’s not failing , ”
80683	80691	80692	80692	Louise	331	“ I certainly hope that ’s true , ”
80703	80720	80721	80721	Louise	331	“ Daisy . Did you replace Tiana ? And who ’s this handsome drink of water ? ”
80725	80753	80721	80721	Louise	331	“ I ’m Louise Anacosta , Department of Children and Family Services , and I ’ll thank you to not call me a handsome drink of water . ”
80818	80852	80810	80810	I	2293	“ Oh ! The stranger . You ’re the stranger Julienne named in her will . Oh , that poor baby . Are you pinching him ? Is that why he ’s crying ? ”
80858	80863	80810	80810	I	2293	“ He ’s hungry . ”
80892	80895	80884	80886	two more strangers	1724	“ Daisy — ”
80896	80899	80900	80900	Louise	331	“ Helene , ”
80903	80926	80927	80927	She	331	“ Helene Carter - Kincaid , yes ? You ’re concerned about your daughter and this man being caretakers for this child ? ”
80945	81077	80932	80932	she	331	“ Well , they certainly ca n’t be worse than his biological parents were . Can you imagine having your childhood one - starred by your mother while your father sleeps with half the neighborhood ? Do n’t believe all those stories you see about Daisy in the news . She ’s the most loyal , loving , amazing woman in the world , and I ’ve never seen her fail when she ’s given a task . All of my insecurities about her parenting skills are a reflection of my own insecurities and failures , but she ’ll be fine . I do n’t know anything about him , but I imagine that ’s what your background checks are for . How did you get put in that will again ? ”
81078	81087	81094	81094	she	1725	“ That ’s a question for another day . ”
81111	81146	81147	81147	Helene	2361	“ Mom , I need to give Louise a tour of the house . Can you please go find Tiana and ask her if she ’ll meet me in the situation room at two ? ”
81169	81178	81163	81163	she	2361	“ Oh , and I got a cat … ”
81186	81190	81191	81191	Daisy	1365	“ Or seven … ”
81194	81200	81201	81201	Alessandro	2859	“ No ! Bad dog ! ”
81255	81260	81261	81261	Daisy	1365	“ Brutus ! No ! ”
81264	81272	81273	81273	Helene	2361	“ Oh my god , the baby ! ”
81354	81367	81368	81368	Louise	331	“ Ms. Carter - Kincaid , what is going on in here ? ”
81371	81376	81377	81377	she	331	“ Neighbor ’s dog — ”
81442	81446	81447	81447	Helene	2361	“ My art ! ”
81450	81455	81456	81456	Daisy	1365	“ Elvira , no ! ”
81459	81462	81463	81463	Remy	1365	“ WWWAAAAAAAHHHHHH , ”
81520	81536	81678	81678	man	1362	“ Yo . D. We still on for my kids to paint your tramp room ? ”
81537	81542	81543	81543	Louise	331	“ Who is that ? ”
81546	81551	81552	81552	Daisy	1365	“ Lil Nutt Sacc , ”
81567	81585	81552	81552	Daisy	1365	“ Mother . What did you do ? Helene ’s shoulders inch as high as her wince . “
81599	81625	81552	81552	Daisy	1365	” Louise freezes . She ’s covered in cat hair . Possibly got cat piss on herself too , to go with the baby piss . “
81630	81634	81626	81628	Lil Nutt Sacc	338	” she repeats . “
81639	81675	81678	81678	man	1362	” the hip hop mogul says with a jerk of his chin . Three cats race back in , but Louise does n’t seem to notice . She ’s gaping . He squints at her . “
81706	81748	81704	81704	girl	1466	” My jaw hits the floor . Daisy ’s mouth is a perfect O. And Helene ’s eyes are darting between the social worker and Lil Nutt like she ’s watching tennis as they approach each other for a chest bump . “
81753	81758	81751	81751	Daisy	1365	” Louise asks him . “
81787	81809	81781	81782	her mom	663	” Daisy sinks to the nearest sofa , Remy clutched to her chest . I wordlessly sit down next to her . “
81816	81820	81810	81810	We	1743	” I mutter . “
81829	81911	81810	81810	We	1743	” she mutters back . It ’s bad . It ’s always bad . Question is , will it be bad enough for us to watch this woman walk away with our baby today ? Thirty Daisy For the second time in four hours , I collapse onto the low couch in the center of my parlor and drop my head back to stare at my mom ’s chandelier , which has a layer of cat hair sticking to it now . “
81918	82080	82081	82081	They	1744	” West settles in next to me , and for once , I do n’t know exactly what I ’m supposed to offer him . If we were at a club or a bar , I ’d have a double - shot of whiskey put on my tab for him . Or possibly a double shot of whiskey for everyone in the bar . But I do n’t think he ’s the type to drink his troubles away . If I was out of the country , I ’d head to the nearest beach or winery or club , put on a different wig , tell my bodyguard to call me Liza , and I ’d hook up with whoever looked the most fun . Except that does n’t even seem appealing right now . I think I ’ve been ruined for one - night stands and weekend flings . And I do n’t know that I ’m sad about it . “
82090	82095	82088	82088	Daisy	1365	” West says quietly . “
82100	82101	82096	82096	You	1745	” “
82112	82229	82107	82107	I	2293	” I have a house with more potential dangers for a child than a nuclear waste facility . The world thinks I ’m an airheaded party girl . My cats got drunk on the organic catnip Luna sent over and went on a rampage after the neighborhood ’s free - range St. Bernard — who is the laziest fucking dog on the planet when he ’s not being a total sweetheart — decided he wanted a little pussy . And I ’m letting my family down . Remy . My mom . My grandma . My dead cousin , who might ’ve been awful , but who did n’t deserve to die so young and tragically . “
82233	82264	82230	82230	You	1746	” West brushes my hair back with a gentle hand , and my wig falls off and topples to the floor behind me . He snortles . It ’s adorable . “
82278	82279	82271	82271	You	1746	” “
82312	82434	82435	82435	Daisy	1365	” I freeze . I did , indeed , provide pizza lunch for Lil Nutt Sacc and his class of future artists . But I do n’t talk about buying all of Miami Beach ’s lunches at Beach Burgers , or filling up the parking meters all along Ocean Drive and all the side streets so that no one has to pay , or randomly — and anonymously — having Carbs ’ n Coffee deliver donuts to all the local hospitals ’ staff once a month . And actually — I did buy this dress for Halloween , and then also use it to hand out cookies once . At a bar , not in a neighborhood , but close enough . “
82437	82441	82435	82435	Daisy	1365	” West says . “
82474	82514	82515	82515	I	2293	” He settles an arm along the back of the sofa , close enough that I can tell myself he ’s wrapping an arm around my shoulders . I mean , if that ’s what I wanted to believe . “
82520	82534	82515	82515	I	2293	” He ’s staring at the fireplace . I ’m staring at him . “
82639	82640	82622	82622	I	2293	” “
82658	82659	82650	82650	they	2364	” “
82662	82735	82650	82650	they	2364	” He ’s lying . Or maybe he thinks he ’s telling the truth . He ’d probably tell me single mothers are strong and more capable than he ’ll ever be , but that does n’t mean he does n’t want to take care of them , whether he realizes it or not . I shift on the seat , pulling my knees up until they ’re resting on his thighs . “
82742	82751	82752	82752	I	2293	” The corner of his lips hitches up . “
82766	82767	82752	82752	I	2293	” “
82781	82782	82775	82776	No man	3057	” “
82788	82789	82783	82783	You	1756	” “
82826	82837	82819	82819	you	1762	” He barks out a laugh and shakes his head . “
82856	82857	82819	82819	you	1762	” “
82869	83015	82866	82867	Westley Jaeger	104	” He tilts his head to study me , and my breath whooshes out of me . Hazel . He has magic , color - changing hazel eyes that have seen more of the world than I have . Maybe he has n’t been as many places . But he ’s seen more . Bad stuff that would reduce me to a crumpled mass of helplessness . Ca n’t be a Marine in this day and age and not have experienced bad things . And he does n’t have anyone taking care of him . He does it himself , because he does n’t think he needs anyone . His family must want to throttle him on a regular basis . But this is their lucky day . Because I , Daisy Imogen Carter - Kincaid , am going to take care of this man . “
83031	83134	83029	83029	you	1763	” he says quietly . A lump rolls up from the bottom of my neck to the top of my throat like it ’s chasing Indiana Jones , and I have to swallow hard to get it back down . Westley Jaeger ’s body and mind might be made of steel , but his heart is cotton candy . Cotton candy that he ’s freely given to a baby that , by all rights , never should ’ve been his , but is now firmly settled in his heart . I shake my head and draw an X over my own heart . “
83139	83206	83029	83029	you	1763	” His eyes narrow slightly , his lips part , and I hear the question that he does n’t voice . Even when whatever this is between us fizzles out ? It ’s a legit question . I do n’t date . But then , I ’ve never had a Westley in my life . I honestly ca n’t imagine my life without him now though . “
83219	83339	83210	83210	I	2293	” he reminds me . He ’s not wrong , and we both know it . She likes him short - term because he gives me credibility . Like he did today , talking about his time in the service , his experience with his sisters , his brother , his nieces and nephews , talking about how well I ’m doing with the baby despite not having a lot of practice . What mother does before her first kid ? he ’d asked . My grandmother was correct to fight to keep him here right now . But she ’s wrong if she thinks there ’s a day coming when West should n’t be in Remy ’s life . “
83348	83352	83354	83354	she	380	” I whisper . “
83367	83534	83360	83360	I	2293	” He does n’t crack a grin . Like he knows I ’m serious . My grandmother is in peak shape for an eighty - two - year - old woman . Her mind ’s sharp . Her body ’s strong . She gives zero fucks and feeds off of fear , which is relatively abundant when she ’s around . It ’s an endless source of energy . She could honestly live past one hundred . But my friends outnumber hers a thousand to one . A lick of power rolls through my belly as the full impact of having friends sets my nerves humming . I can stand up to my grandmother . And I will land on my feet . No , check that . I can fucking soar . West is still studying me , but he ’s not in growly overprotective Marine mode . No , this is something else . It ’s white - hot attraction mixed with … pride ? “
83542	83546	83535	83535	You	1766	” he murmurs . “
83555	83567	83535	83535	You	1766	” I slide a hand over his stomach and lean closer . “
83574	83711	83569	83569	I	2293	” His lips are mere inches away . My mother will be upstairs with Remy for the next fourteen years . The doors are all locked and guarded . I can kiss this man for the rest of the day if I want , and no one will disturb us . There ’s no shame in being caught doing what comes naturally , but this — this is n’t just raw , carnal pleasure to be had . This is more . He ’s not asking for just my body . He ’s asking for me . And I do n’t want just his body . I want this strong , capable , dependable man who asks for so little for himself to know that there ’s someone in this world who will put him first . “
83719	83720	83721	83721	Shh	327	” “
83729	83739	83723	83723	You	1365	” I brush a thumb over his lower lip . “
83743	83752	83723	83723	You	1365	” There ’s that half - grin again . “
83759	83760	83755	83755	I	2293	” “
83766	83917	83761	83761	You	1365	” He does n’t stop me . He probably should . This is me , diving into the deep end with both feet like I usually do . Except when my lips brush his , and his fingers wrap around the back of my head , and his heart leaps beneath my hand , I know this is the deep end I ’ve been looking for my entire life . His short beard scratches the delicate skin around my mouth , lighting up my nerve endings . His lips part , brushing open - mouth kisses to my own parted lips , and I ’m not melting . I ’m toasting like a marshmallow . Hot and sticky and pliable . Knowing I ’m in danger of going up in flames , and not caring a bit , because oh my god , his mouth . And his hands . And his—“Well
83929	83952	83953	83953	Mom	380	” We fly apart . West leaps off the sofa . I flail my arms , uncertain what to do with them . “
83959	83960	83957	83957	Remy	1365	” “
83970	84006	83963	83964	Your grandmother	84	” She turns to West , who ’s not pacing , but looks like he wants to be slipping into the dark corners of the room . Outside , lightning flashes . Stupid tropical storm . “
84015	84019	84020	84020	Mom	380	” Mom demands . “
84022	84033	84020	84020	Mom	380	” West silences me with a hand on my shoulder . “
84089	84106	84125	84125	baby	598	” I gape at him . Mom ca n’t stop blinking . Her jaw ’s unhinged . “
84116	84120	84111	84111	I	2293	” I mutter . “
84155	84183	84125	84125	baby	598	” He pats my shoulder and straightens again , spearing my speechless mother with a glare I would n’t want to be on the receiving end of . “
84188	84280	84125	84125	baby	598	” I snort . It ’s not a delicate snort . It ’s a full - on , I should not be laughing at this snort . But despite the growly voice , I do n’t think West is truly offended . There ’s this fuck , yeah , I can have fun too twinkle in his eye that makes me want to jump him . He ’s not just a responsibility - first military man . He ’s hiding some fun under that exterior . Thunder rolls through the house . “
84302	84314	84291	84291	I	2293	” West adds . Hello , hot flash in the chacha . “
84322	84323	84291	84291	I	2293	” “
84337	84378	84383	84383	Daisy	1365	” Oh , fuck . I know he ’s joking just to horrify my mother some more , but I do n’t actually have a leopard print thong bikini . And I think I need to rectify that . Stat . “
84392	84397	84385	84385	He	1365	” my mother gasps . “
84400	84404	84383	84383	Daisy	1365	” he growls . “
84411	84444	84445	84445	Mother	98	” He turns on his heel with military precision — which is also hot as fuck — and strolls to the staircase while my mother gapes wide - eyed at his back . “
84447	84451	84445	84445	Mother	98	” I hiss . “
84454	84455	84456	84456	He	1365	” “
84461	84462	84456	84456	He	1365	” “
84473	84572	84456	84456	He	1365	” Her eyes light up , and she rubs her hands together in glee , and I realize I ’ve made a very big , very bad , very fatal mistake . And now my mother thinks we ’re getting married . Not now . But eventually . When I fall so hard I ca n’t see my life without West in it . And she thinks I do n’t know what she ’s thinking . But I do . And I need a paper bag . Because for once , she might actually be psychic . Psychic . “
84577	84743	84456	84456	He	1365	” I gasp , and I lunge for my phone . It ’s all suddenly crystal clear . I just need a few hours to prove it . Thirty - One West The storm ’s rolling in hard and heavy tonight , and I ’m mentally going through the condo renovation I ’m helping a buddy with . Pretty sure I remembered to seal all the windows , but I ’ll need to go check it out in the morning after the storm passes . I ’ve barricaded myself and Remy in the Pepto Bismol room — the one Daisy called the Strawberry Daiquiri suite — and I ’m debating texting her to ask if the community has bad weather sirens — and which room is safest in a tornado — when there ’s a knock at the door . I watch , and the lock unlocks , the door cracks open , and I catch sight of a blue eye and dangling purple hair . “
84768	84785	84754	84755	my mother	82	” Fuck . Her grandmother is stuck here . I need to prepare some contingency plans . “
84789	84790	84791	84791	My	2293	” “
84799	84800	84791	84791	My	2293	” “
84804	84805	84806	84806	I	2293	” “
84837	84945	84948	84949	my mom	380	” I ’m not actually surprised Daisy checked the weather . But I am worried about how much I want to go with her . Without Remy . And there ’s not much about my sleep shorts that ’ll hide how I ’m feeling . But I grab the sleeping baby and a book and follow her down the hallway , watching her hips swing in those pink velour pants and that strip of skin low on her back flash beneath her short black T - shirt . Our window to sneak out of here is short . And I have to get my cock under control . “
84951	84955	84956	84956	You	380	” she whispers . “
85004	85076	84998	84998	You	380	” Remy half - coos in his sleep . Daisy picks up the pace , and soon we ’re rounding the top of the D and coming to a stop at the wall at the end of the corridor . Logically , I know her bedroom is on the other side of that wall . Practically , we ’re at a dead end . She flashes a grin back at me . “
85083	85108	84998	84998	You	380	” Without waiting for an answer , she leans into the corner . There ’s a subtle click , and a secret door opens . “
85117	85265	84998	84998	You	380	” I follow her inside , but we ’re not in her bedroom . We ’re in a massive library . Rather than the typical billionaire home library with dark shelves and leather - bound books and priceless artwork , though , Daisy ’s library has watercolors I do n’t recognize and white shelves filled with worn paperbacks . These books have been read . And loved . I angle closer , looking at the titles . Romance novels . My sisters are going to love her . If she ’s serious . If she ’ll let me stay in Remy ’s life . If this thing I ’m feeling is mutual . I ’m attached , and I do n’t want to get unattached . And legally speaking , I do n’t have to . I can be a part of Remy ’s life . Forever . “
85273	85277	85267	85267	you	1789	” I ask . “
85282	85294	85267	85267	you	1789	” She points to the shelves around the white marble fireplace . “
85334	85335	85330	85330	my	2293	” “
85342	85343	85330	85330	my	2293	” “
85348	85546	85330	85330	my	2293	” She grins and winks , but I do n’t believe for a second that she has n’t been impacted by people ’s opinions of her . I turn away from the shelves and take stock of the rest of the room , because the idea of Daisy as a secret romantic who spends hours in here , reading and dreaming of finding her Prince Charming is too much to handle tonight . I ’ve hoped before . Hoped , and loved , and lost . With women who were n’t the fascinating , intricate puzzle that is Daisy Imogen Carter - Kincaid . The rest of her library is exquisite . Pine wood flooring . Overstuffed chairs the color of the ocean . A fresco ceiling painted with a young girl dancing with unicorns . Daisies worked into the wide plaster trim along the ceiling and around the doorways . Little touches of femininity everywhere , from the heart - shaped sconces on the plaster wall to the delicate pink glass flowers on the white marble fireplace mantle . No windows here — and I wonder if there ’s another hidden door that leads outside somewhere . “
85556	85560	85330	85330	my	2293	” I ask . “
85567	85576	85330	85330	my	2293	” She tiptoes beside me on bare feet . “
85590	85693	85586	85586	I	2293	” I could give her snuggles . I ’d like to give her snuggles . Naked snuggles on that fuzzy white rug in front of the fireplace . With my cock rocking against her pussy . I clear my throat and hand her the baby , who curls into her chest and sighs happily while she smiles softly at him . Seriously . Easiest baby ever . Even with all of the movement , he ’s stayed asleep . He ’ll be up again and hungry in an hour or two , but for now , he ’s blissed out and happy . “
85696	85793	85586	85586	I	2293	” Daisy waves at one of the chairs in front of the fireplace . I oblige , and I have to concentrate hard on not appreciating the curve of her breasts and hips in that get - up . She grabs her phone from a decorative table near the door , then crosses back to me . Instead of taking the other seat , she settles into my lap while thunder rolls outside . My arms go around her , my nuts cheer , and when she looks at me , I want to kiss her . “
85796	85815	85586	85586	I	2293	” I say softly . She shifts Remy across her breasts and presses a kiss to my cheek . “
85830	85831	85823	85823	I	2293	” “
85849	85850	85851	85852	Westley Jaeger	104	” “
85862	85863	85851	85852	Westley Jaeger	104	” “
85869	85894	85851	85852	Westley Jaeger	104	” She smiles , and it ’s brighter and more dazzling than lightning on the ocean , and an order of magnitude more dangerous . “
85903	85973	85897	85897	You	2293	” She shifts in my lap , swipes her thumb over the phone , and stops on a video in her text messages , which she enlarges to the full screen . She hits play , then hands me the phone to hold while we both watch . It ’s dim , like it ’s being shot at night , with little specks of light floating across the screen . “
85978	85982	85897	85897	You	2293	” I ask . “
85985	86013	85897	85897	You	2293	” A shadow moves into the frame , and I realize I ’m staring at — oh , fuck . Seriously ? It ’s a crystal ball . “
86034	86052	86027	86028	Your husband	1795	” The first voice is low and raspy , and it makes my hairs stand on end . “
86083	86155	86077	86077	I	2293	” Hearing Julienne ’s voice puts a hitch in my shoulders . Daisy shivers , and I pull her closer . She ’s soft and curvy and fits perfectly , and I do n’t want to move . Do n’t want to watch the rest of this video either , because the creepy - crawlies dancing up my spine are warning me that whatever it is , it ’ll change everything . “
86163	86179	86156	86156	You	2293	” Becky the psychic says . The shadow that I assume is Julienne ’s nods . “
86194	86205	86180	86180	I	2293	” What ? Daisy puts a hand to my chest . “
86208	86221	86222	86222	She	380	” she says again . Becky the Psychic leans over the ball . “
86230	86231	86222	86222	She	380	” “
86325	86326	86306	86306	she	380	” “
86337	86338	86306	86306	she	380	” “
86456	86457	86448	86448	She	380	” “
86464	86468	86458	86458	She	380	” I whisper . “
86474	86478	86469	86469	You	1809	” Becky intones . “
86490	86494	86469	86469	You	1809	” Julienne shrieks . “
86510	86511	86514	86514	enemies	1810	” “
86552	86582	86540	86541	your husband	1795	” Daisy ’s not the only one with a shiver now . Eternal peace is a fuck - ton more ominous considering both Julienne and Rafe are dead now . “
86587	86591	86592	86592	You	1809	” I mutter . “
86596	86600	86601	86601	Shh	327	” Daisy whispers . “
86603	86604	86601	86601	Shh	327	” “
86610	86615	86601	86601	Shh	327	” Julienne is saying . “
86692	86693	86694	86694	You	1820	” “
86702	86706	86694	86694	You	1820	” Becky repeats . “
86734	86735	86731	86731	her	1821	” “
86742	86746	86731	86731	her	1821	” Daisy whispers . “
86753	86754	86731	86731	her	1821	” “
86770	86771	86764	86764	You	1820	” “
86840	86841	86833	86833	She	380	” “
86846	86865	86866	86866	I	2293	” I mutter . I ca n’t stop saying it , because it keeps getting stranger and stranger . “
86874	86925	86926	86927	A man	490	” Becky suddenly gasps . It ’s an overdramatic kind of gasp , the kind that normal people do n’t make , the kind that makes me ask who believes this shit , and I almost shut the phone off , but Daisy swats my finger away when I try . “
86932	86936	86926	86927	A man	490	” Julienne asks . “
86942	86943	86944	86945	A man	490	” “
86981	86982	86987	86989	my general contractor	1830	” “
87007	87017	86997	86997	He	490	” Oh , fuck me . No . No . “
87022	87028	87030	87030	his	490	” Becky the Psychic says . “
87061	87069	87070	87070	Becky	348	“ Yes ! I see a J ! ”
87073	87078	87079	87079	Julienne	408	“ His last name ? ”
87082	87088	87089	87089	I	2293	“ This is forking insane , ”
87094	87099	87100	87100	Daisy	1365	“ It explains everything , ”
87108	87116	87100	87100	Daisy	1365	“ Should I leave Rafe for Westley ? ”
87168	87180	87181	87182	Madame Becky	106	“ No , you must stick by your husband to survive , ”
87185	87203	87204	87204	Julienne	408	“ So name Westley as my baby ’s guardian if Anthony and Margot take us both out . ”
87220	87234	87209	87209	she	106	“ He can take my son away . Keep him safe from them . ”
87235	87243	87216	87216	she	106	“ And … I see a woman … ”
87244	87257	87258	87258	Julienne	408	“ Probably a lot of them , with the way he looks , ”
87261	87279	87258	87258	Julienne	408	“ She’s … blond . No , brunette . No … purple . Purple ? Surely not — ”
87280	87283	87284	87284	Julienne	408	“ Daisy ! ”
87302	87311	87258	87258	Julienne	408	“ You have got to be shirting me . ”
87312	87317	87318	87318	Julienne	408	“ My cousin Daisy ! ”
87322	87335	87318	87318	Julienne	408	“ She never wears the same hair two weeks in a row ! ”
87336	87343	87344	87344	I	2293	“ She ’s a scam artist , ”
87402	87419	87420	87420	She	408	“ She guesses until she ’s close enough for her clients to reach their own conclusion . ”
87425	87451	87420	87420	She	408	“ Julienne thought of you during a psychic reading when she thought her mother - in - law was plotting to kill her with peanuts . ”
87452	87457	87501	87501	She	408	“ She was allergic ? ”
87458	87482	87483	87483	She	408	“ Highly . But West — she knew you ’d be good for her baby . Better than anyone she ’s related to . ”
87493	87500	87483	87483	She	408	“ Where ’d you find this ? ”
87535	87548	87523	87523	He	1365	“ Julienne one - starred Madame Becky the week Remy was born . ”
87549	87555	87523	87523	He	1365	“ You read her blog ? ”
87556	87564	87565	87565	She	408	“ Not on purpose . I was — ”
87577	87590	87565	87565	She	408	“ You looked up what formula and diapers he was used to . ”
87621	87664	87606	87606	she	408	“ I remembered this afternoon , and on a whim , I reached out to ask Madame Becky if she knew anything — and not about my future , just about Julienne ’s last weeks — and she sent me the video . ”
87665	87671	87593	87593	she	408	“ She videotapes her readings ? ”
87672	87688	87606	87606	she	408	“ Just some . She ’s running a how - to fortune teller course soon . ”
87689	87710	87606	87606	she	408	“ You think Margot Roderick would ’ve poisoned her if — if the dolphins had n’t gotten to her first ? ”
87711	87790	87593	87593	she	408	“ No idea . But I sent the video to our attorneys . It might not prove Julienne was right in the head , but it ’ll prove she was n’t drunk and she most definitely did not want the Rodericks to raise her son . Plus , she still had to convince Rafe , so it ’s not like the will was impulsive . She named both of us on purpose . And now we know why . ”
87791	87802	87606	87606	she	408	“ I ’m here because she was a paranoid nutjob . ”
87803	87821	87822	87822	I	2293	“ No , nuts would kill her . She was more of a paranoid banana - job . ”
87844	87863	87836	87836	She	1839	“ Point is … I’m not his family , and I should n’t have been in that will . ”
87864	87878	87606	87606	she	408	“ Westley , you are more family than anyone I ’ve ever known . ”
87879	87889	87836	87836	She	1839	“ You ’ve never even seen me with mine . ”
87890	87896	87836	87836	She	1839	“ Yes , I have . ”
87897	87902	87606	87606	she	408	“ No , you — ”
87903	87937	87938	87938	I	2293	“ Family is what you make it . Tell me you did n’t have your Marines family . Go on . Tell me you did n’t have brothers and sisters in the Corps . ”
87968	87992	87993	87993	she	593	“ You did n’t have to stay . You chose to . That makes you more family to Remy than even I am , ”
87996	88028	87993	87993	she	593	“ I had to step up . You did n’t . And if you had n’t been there that first night — maybe that psychic knew what she was talking about . ”
88029	88035	87993	87993	she	593	“ You believe in psychics ? ”
88036	88042	87993	87993	she	593	“ I believe in you . ”
88112	88115	88101	88101	she	593	“ Daisy — ”
88116	88131	88132	88132	I	2293	“ Do you still want to stay ? I would n’t blame you if — ”
88301	88312	88313	88313	she	593	“ Are you laughing at my technique , Mr. Jaeger ? ”
88316	88332	88313	88313	she	593	“ No . You — you’re — you make me lightheaded . I like it . ”
88457	88474	88449	88449	Daisy	1365	“ You ’re not kissing me just because I ’m a single mom , are you ? ”
88475	88487	88488	88488	Her	593	“ I ’m kissing you because you ’re so much more . ”
88497	88509	88510	88510	she	593	“ I ’m not . I fake my way through everything , ”
88535	88542	88543	88543	She	593	“ I mean — not that . ”
88551	88565	88566	88566	Regroup	349	“ I mean I ’m only successful in business because people like me . ”
88753	88756	88744	88744	Remy	1365	“ Daisy . ”
88772	88794	88757	88757	He	1365	“ Being a people person is a skill . And you ’re not faking your way through taking care of Remy . ”
88840	88850	88830	88830	I	2293	“ I am . I ’m totally faking it . ”
88851	88862	88807	88809	the little guy	1365	“ That kid adores you . Babies see through fake . ”
88863	89008	88830	88830	I	2293	“ But he ’s so easy . It ’s not me . It ’s him . I ’m not looking for pity here . I have a good life . There are seven and a half billion people on earth , and I have more than all but like a thousand of them . But I ’m not a good person . My friend Emily ? She helps minimize the appearance of scar tissue on people who need it . Cam runs a foundation that funds scholarships for kids and so much more . Luna ’s a freaking charity goddess and an earth savior to boot . Her boyfriend Big Dick Beck saves innocent dogs . And what do I do ? I tell Carbs ’ n Coffee to put everyone ’s bill on my tab some random day . That’s — that ’s — ”
89009	89013	89106	89106	he	1860	“ Incredibly thoughtful . ”
89014	89024	89025	89025	My	2293	“ So small compared to what I could do . ”
89051	89076	89084	89084	he	1860	“ It ’s not small to make someone ’s day . And getting up to the counter to order a burger and finding out — ”
89097	89105	89106	89106	he	1860	“ You did that at Beach Burgers , ”
89110	89117	89106	89106	he	1860	“ The day we inherited Remy . ”
89118	89121	89122	89122	I	2293	“ Maybe , ”
89141	89155	89156	89156	His	1860	“ Never saw a tip jar so full as it was that night . ”
89165	89214	89156	89156	His	1860	“ There ’s a ripple effect . You do something nice for someone , they ’re inspired to do something nice for someone else . You did n’t just buy a few hundred burgers , Daisy . You reminded a few hundred people of the power of joy . ”
89215	89222	89223	89223	I	2293	“ I was buying happier feelings , ”
89226	89263	89223	89223	I	2293	“ The funeral — it was awful . No one was sad they were gone . I did n’t do it for the people getting free burgers . I did it to make myself feel better . ”
89264	89271	89156	89156	His	1860	“ You did it for both . ”
89272	89297	89223	89223	I	2293	“ Does it really count as a random act of kindness if I ’m doing it so someone misses me when I ’m gone ? ”
89298	89305	89306	89306	I	2293	“ Who knew it was you ? ”
89315	89325	89326	89326	He	2293	“ Little louder for the good ear , Daisy . ”
89353	89423	89346	89346	I	2293	“ I said , no one . I mean , Tiana and Alessandro know , and the manager at Beach Burgers , but he also knows I wo n’t do it again if he lets it slip that it ’s me , and his staff makes such good money on those days when I — I mean , I got a free burger out of it myself , and — ”
89424	89435	89346	89346	I	2293	“ Why are you minimizing your impact in the world ? ”
89436	89498	89499	89499	He	1861	“ Because it ’s not about them . It ’s about making me feel good . And that ’s just as selfish and stupid as my grandmother diving into a pile of cash in her version of an adult ball pit room in her fortress . I ’m a horrible , awful , selfish asshole who only wants to have fun . ”
89554	89592	89593	89593	His	1861	“ Have you had so little love in your life that you do n’t know how valuable you are ? And I ’m not talking about your bank account , Daisy . I ’m talking about this . ”
89618	89627	89628	89628	I	2293	“ I do n’t have one of those , ”
89632	89655	89656	89656	He	1365	“ I ca n’t . I ’m a Carter . We get them traded in for mechanical banks when we ’re born . ”
89687	89866	89674	89674	he	1365	“ You could make yourself feel good in so many other ways . Drugs . Alcohol . Sex . But you choose to do it with random acts of kindness . And taking care of a baby that is n’t yours . And making the world a better place . How often do you get drunk ? Really drunk ? Because I ’ve been here close to a month , and I have n’t seen it . Have n’t flown in any men from Europe or Australia to scratch an itch either . You could ’ve been just like your cousin , tearing down everything and everyone publicly , but you do n’t . You let three dozen kids into your house to paint your walls with artwork most of the world would ’ve called graffiti . You think to buy coffee and donuts for other people . You ’re not a selfish asshole . You ’re a good person with a big heart and a shitty family if they ’ve never told you how amazing you are . ”
89867	89885	89674	89674	he	1365	“ You should n’t put me on a pedestal . I ’m going to let you down . ”
89886	89936	89674	89674	he	1365	“ People fuck up , Daisy . It ’s what makes us human . Hell , I ’m gon na let you down too . But you know what ? I ’ll forgive you . We ’ll learn . We ’ll move on . And we ’ll be fine . ”
90199	90202	90203	90203	He	1365	“ West ? ”
90215	90218	90203	90203	He	1365	“ Hm ? ”
90219	90228	90229	90229	His	1365	“ I ’m going to jump your bones . ”
90249	90253	90244	90244	I	2293	“ Are you ? ”
90254	90258	90203	90203	He	1365	“ I am . ”
90259	90262	90244	90244	I	2293	“ Tonight ? ”
90263	90267	90268	90268	He	1365	“ Right now . ”
90274	90281	90268	90268	He	1365	“ While you ’re wearing that ? ”
90316	90319	90268	90268	He	1365	“ Better ? ”
90320	90325	90326	90326	he	1365	“ Fuck , Daisy , ”
90344	90353	90354	90354	I	2293	“ Not your first glimpse , Mr. Jaeger , ”
90379	90391	90401	90401	he	1365	“ But if you want me to put it back on — ”
90492	90495	90483	90483	I	2293	“ More , ”
90500	90505	90506	90506	He	1365	“ Touch me more . ”
90680	90683	90666	90666	He	1365	“ What — ”
90732	90737	90718	90718	West	2385	“ Oh , yes . ”
90784	90791	90769	90769	I	2293	“ Yes , yes , yes , ”
90824	90831	90820	90820	he	1365	“ Not going anywhere , Daisy . ”
90855	90872	90832	90832	He	1365	“ I ’ve been fantasizing about touching you for — well , it feels like years . ”
90873	90881	90882	90882	I	2293	“ I ca n’t let you go , ”
91026	91031	91015	91015	He	1365	“ You want me . ”
91032	91043	91015	91015	He	1365	“ I do n’t understand how any woman could n’t . ”
91051	91057	91015	91015	He	1365	“ I ’m very boring . ”
91058	91063	91064	91064	I	2293	“ You are not . ”
91095	91099	91089	91089	He	1365	“ I am . ”
91149	91154	91155	91155	he	1365	“ Fuck , Daisy , ”
91158	91168	91155	91155	he	1365	“ You are not boring . You ’re hilarious . ”
91169	91193	91213	91213	he	1365	“ You’re — christ , that feels so good — the only — oh , fuck yes — person who thinks — so . ”
91194	91205	91213	91213	he	1365	“ Huh . I ’m the smart one for once . ”
91206	91212	91213	91213	he	1365	“ You ’ve always been — ”
91305	91308	91309	91309	I	2293	“ Westley ? ”
91320	91323	91309	91309	I	2293	“ Yes ? ”
91324	91331	91332	91332	He	1365	“ You make me feel alive . ”
91344	91361	91332	91332	He	1365	“ You have more life in your pinky than most people have in their entire families . ”
91362	91371	91332	91332	He	1365	“ But you make my heart feel alive . ”
91420	91428	91409	91409	he	1365	“ You make me feel not boring . ”
91429	91435	91436	91436	He	1365	“ I drive you crazy . ”
91443	91447	91436	91436	He	1365	“ You do . ”
91656	91664	91650	91650	I	2293	“ Whoops . Forgot to do laundry . ”
91665	91670	91683	91683	His	1365	“ You did not . ”
91671	91682	91683	91683	His	1365	“ Okay , I did n’t . Are you horrified ? ”
91705	91711	91712	91712	he	1365	“ So fucking turned on , ”
91728	91732	91733	91733	he	1365	“ So wet , ”
91747	91761	91733	91733	he	1365	“ Christ , you feel like heaven . Do you taste as good ? ”
91777	91790	91791	91791	He	1365	“ Maybe if you ’re good , you can find out later . ”
91794	91800	91791	91791	He	1365	“ I can be good . ”
91801	91822	91827	91827	he	1365	“ Wait . Maybe if you ’re bad , you can find out later . Ohmygod , do n’t stop . ”
91823	91826	91827	91827	he	1365	“ This ? ”
91841	91844	91838	91838	I	2293	“ Yes . ”
91845	91848	91849	91849	He	1365	“ Now ? ”
91873	91889	91838	91838	I	2293	“ Maybe I want you to stroke me first before I give you any more . ”
91890	91896	91902	91902	he	1365	“ You — distracted me . ”
91897	91901	91902	91902	he	1365	“ With this ? ”
91914	91917	91902	91902	he	1365	“ Yes . ”
91918	91934	91935	91936	Westley Jaeger	104	“ I ca n’t seem to help myself . Such a sweet , hot pussy . ”
91991	91994	91995	91995	he	1365	“ You — ”
92136	92139	92140	92140	he	1365	“ Daisy , ”
92173	92179	92163	92163	He	1365	“ I was n’t done , ”
92184	92189	92180	92180	I	2293	“ I almost was . ”
92190	92199	92200	92200	He	1365	“ And the problem with that is … ? ”
92214	92230	92200	92200	He	1365	“ I want to be good for you . And it’s … been a while . ”
92231	92255	92256	92256	His	1365	“ If you think this is the only time I ’m getting you naked in the next forever , you are sadly mistaken . ”
92279	92291	92292	92292	I	2293	“ Are we going to fight for who ’s on top ? ”
92295	92305	92306	92306	He	1365	“ Because you should know I will always win . ”
92329	92333	92334	92334	His	1365	“ Do you ? ”
92350	92353	92354	92354	he	1365	“ Condom ? ”
92439	92447	92432	92432	his	1365	“ Christ , Daisy , you ’re — ”
92448	92457	92458	92458	I	2293	“ Oh my god , I ’m coming ! ”
92641	92652	92632	92632	she	2405	“ Because you ’re so very talented with your fingers , ”
92673	92691	92653	92653	she	2405	“ you get to choose . Blow job ? Or your very impressive cock in my pussy ? ”
92733	92742	92743	92743	she	2405	“ Oh , no , he did n’t , ”
92756	92762	92746	92746	I	2293	“ I ’ll get him . ”
92763	92795	92743	92743	she	2405	“ No , you wo n’t . We ’re both going to hold our breath for five minutes , and if that does n’t work , then I ’ll get him . ”
92802	92813	92814	92814	I	2293	“ You ca n’t hold your breath for five minutes , ”
92818	92824	92825	92825	I	2293	“ Do n’t test me . ”
92833	92846	92829	92829	I	2293	“ Five minutes , and I ’ll have him back to sleep . ”
92862	92867	92853	92853	Remy	1365	“ Go to sleep , ”
93051	93062	93063	93063	She	2405	“ Ohmygod , why did you let me fall asleep ? ”
93110	93113	93105	93105	he	1365	“ West . ”
93135	93147	93114	93114	She	2405	“ You crazy man . You should ’ve woken me up . ”
93148	93155	93114	93114	She	2405	“ One of us needs sleep . ”
93156	93164	93114	93114	She	2405	“ Your turn . Bed . Go . ”
93165	93169	93114	93114	She	2405	“ Rough night . ”
93170	93207	93114	93114	She	2405	“ You are in so much trouble for not waking me up . Hand me the baby . And go to sleep . Now . Before I call my mother and grandmother in here to visit . ”
93225	93241	93242	93242	She	1888	“ C’m on , Mr. I Can Do Everything . You can go to bed . ”
93262	93276	93259	93259	She	1888	“ Oh , god . This is totally inappropriate , is n’t it ? ”
93301	93310	93313	93313	she	1888	“ Babies like skin . Helps them bond . ”
93508	93612	93498	93499	The Dame	380	“ He does n’t want food . His diaper ’s clean . I gave him a bath , which he hated . Reading to him is like having a demon sprout off his forehead and spew terror all over everywhere . He screamed so loud that he scared the cat . And do n’t ask which one . All of them . Just assume he scared all of them . I ’ve lost my touch with babies . Daisy . How did this happen ? It was just yesterday that you were a baby , and now I ca n’t soothe this one . ”
93634	93644	93645	93645	she	1115	“ That ’s because he needs his other grandma , ”
93671	93689	93690	93690	she	1115	“ He knows who ’d fly through a tropical storm to get here , does n’t he ? ”
93704	93709	93690	93690	she	1115	“ Who are you ? ”
93739	93750	93751	93751	Mom	380	“ Oh . Oh ! Are you Westley ’s mother ? ”
93758	93819	93820	93820	She	380	“ We have so much to talk about . Like how wonderful your son is . And how much you ’re going to adore Daisy . And how quickly we ’re going to get you away from my mother , because that ’s in everyone ’s best interest . Are you hungry ? Thirsty ? You want some frozen yogurt ? ”
93826	93852	93820	93820	She	380	“ Daisy . What flavors do you have this week ? The coconut is the best , especially if you swirl it with the chocolate . ”
93872	93878	93883	93883	her	380	“ I ’ll take chocolate , ”
93885	93890	93883	93883	her	380	“ Coconut for me , ”
93895	93915	93883	93883	her	380	“ Get out of the way , you Amazonian . You and your big head are blocking my view . ”
93934	93941	93942	93942	he	216	“ They were on the list , ”
93986	93993	93994	93994	I	2293	“ Australia can wait , Grammykins , ”
93997	94002	93994	93994	I	2293	“ It can not — ”
94003	94013	94014	94014	I	2293	“ It ’s a bad investment . It can . ”
94044	94062	94073	94075	the shortest one	1901	“ Hi . I ’m Daisy . And I ca n’t wait to meet all of you . ”
94063	94072	94073	94075	the shortest one	1901	“ Oh my god , she ’s real , ”
94084	94091	94078	94078	We	1902	“ Of course she ’s real , ”
94099	94112	94092	94096	the one with blond highlights	1901	“ I ca n’t tell if she ’s slept with him yet , ”
94122	94130	94092	94096	the one with blond highlights	1901	“ She ’s not sleeping with West , ”
94143	94188	94092	94096	the one with blond highlights	1901	“ He ’s all business first . Probably has n’t even noticed her since she ’s competing with this adorable little bundle of fluff . Hi , you cranky little cranky - pants . You need hugs from Aunt Allie , do n’t you ? ”
94189	94199	94131	94140	the one with the darkest hair and plain chocolate eyes	1901	“ Watch out , Allie . They ’re contagious , ”
94204	94214	94092	94096	the one with blond highlights	1901	“ For the last time , Oscar is fixed . ”
94215	94221	94222	94223	my grandmother	380	“ Who are these people ? ”
94226	94229	94230	94230	I	2293	“ Family . ”
94243	94261	94230	94230	I	2293	“ There ’s more froyo in the kitchen . Peanut butter and potato chip sandwiches , anyone ? ”
94262	94266	94267	94268	my grandmother	380	“ Daisy Imogen — ”
94272	94278	94279	94279	Alessandro	2859	“ I ’ve got her , ”
94285	94293	94279	94279	Alessandro	2859	“ You know you ’re my favorite . ”
94294	94301	94267	94268	my grandmother	380	“ Next week ’s my anniversary . ”
94302	94321	94322	94322	I	2293	“ And you know you ’re getting a good raise even if you do n’t deal with her . ”
94401	94406	94407	94407	he	1909	“ Oh , fuck , ”
94410	94416	94407	94407	he	1909	“ Go back to bed . ”
94428	94435	94417	94417	I	2293	“ I ’ve got ‘ em . ”
94436	94443	94444	94444	he	1909	“ But — they’re — fuck , ”
94448	94460	94444	94444	he	1909	“ Westley . That ’s no way to greet your mother . ”
94507	94514	94515	94515	He	2460	“ I was talking about them . ”
94546	94553	94554	94554	He	2460	“ They were worried about you . ”
94559	94566	94554	94554	He	2460	“ They wanted to meet Daisy . ”
94567	94571	94572	94574	the short one	1917	“ That too , ”
94577	94599	94572	94574	the short one	1917	“ Initial indications are that we could get along , but so far , I ’ve only been promised frozen yogurt . ”
94600	94608	94609	94609	I	2293	“ My grandmother ’s in my office , ”
94614	94629	94609	94609	I	2293	“ But all is not lost . I keep spare tubs in the freezer . ”
94630	94634	94635	94635	he	2460	“ That freezer ? ”
94644	94650	94635	94635	he	2460	“ Nope . This one . ”
94696	94702	94679	94679	Remy	1365	“ Does he have gas ? ”
94703	94710	94817	94817	he	1365	“ Does he need to poop ? ”
94711	94731	94679	94679	Remy	1365	“ One time , Mia screamed for six hours because she ’d gotten a hair tied around her toe . ”
94732	94757	94679	94679	Remy	1365	“ The twins used to take turns screaming like that . They ’d feed off each other . Be glad you only have one . ”
94758	94771	94817	94817	he	1365	“ My oldest used to scream anytime we held her facing outward . ”
94772	94784	94679	94679	Remy	1365	“ My oldest would scream anytime we held him facing inward . ”
94785	94791	94679	94679	Remy	1365	“ Babies are so complicated . “
94795	94796	94797	94797	He	1365	” “
94812	94813	94817	94817	he	1365	” “
94829	94830	94831	94832	Which kid	1922	” “
94845	94846	94851	94851	he	1365	” “
94857	94876	94851	94851	he	1365	” West looks at them . Looks at me . Shakes his head with a half - smile . “
94881	94882	94883	94883	They	1922	” “
94890	94906	94907	94907	They	1922	” He bends over , grabs a container of froyo , and finds a spoon . “
94917	94980	94914	94914	me	2293	” I lift a brow . He just chuckles and keeps going . He pauses to hug each of them , kisses each of them on the tops of their heads . But when he heads for the door , none of his family stops him . They notice he ’s going . But his sisters trade grins that say they understand . “
94984	95013	94914	94914	me	2293	” his mom asks me . She has a way of wording the question that makes me think she ’s talking about more than just Remy not sleeping . “
95017	95106	94914	94914	me	2293	” I reply . And I think I ’m getting red in the cheeks . Which makes my mom grin so big , her cheeks are about to crack . And the weird thing is , I do n’t think I mind that she ’s hearing wedding bells . Not one bit . Thirty - Five West The noise from the kitchen has barely faded down the hallway when I run into someone who makes me appreciate my family on a level I never would ’ve thought possible . “
95110	95115	95116	95117	Mrs. Carter	124	” Imogen Carter sniffs . “
95119	95219	95116	95117	Mrs. Carter	124	” If she were my grandmother just being a butthead , I ’d call her Satan and move on . But I think she honestly expects the world to bend to her , and I ’m not in a mood to fight . Besides , she can make Daisy ’s life hell . I ’d like to avoid that . Alessandro ’s behind her , and he shoots me a look that simultaneously calls me a chicken and thanks me for not being a dick . I ’m gearing up for a fight when she steps calmly around me . “
95228	95602	95225	95226	Mr. Jaeger	104	” That was … weird . I cut a look to Alessandro , but he seems just as perplexed as I am that she did n’t take the opportunity to tell me she ’s signed Remy up for ballroom dancing lessons . A chill washes over me . She does n’t think I ’ll be here long . I ’m no longer her problem . Fuck . I believe Daisy when she says she ’ll stand up to her grandmother , but Imogen ’s hardly powerless . My breathing is fast and choppy , and I remind myself I ’m here to take it one day at a time . One fucking minute at a time if I need to . We ’ll be fine . Daisy and I will be fine , and Remy will be fine , and everything , right now , in this moment , is good . That ’s good enough . I need to get out to my job site , but I do n’t want to . I want to go sit by the pool . Cannonball into it . Race my sisters on unicorn rafts . And have fun . Not in a who - can - do - the - most - push - ups way . But in a this is my family and they ’re awesome kind of way . One margarita into my mom , and she ’ll be busting out the jokes like she ’s on a stage . One margarita into Allie , and she ’ll start confessing to all the things she made Keely take the fall for in high school . And I can laugh at them instead of telling them they ’re being ridiculous and immature , because life ’s about more than just following the rules . What the fuck has following the rules ever gotten for my heart ? I almost turn around to go grab Daisy , toss her over my shoulder , and then dash out to the pool to leap in with both of us , but there ’s no need . She ’s sneaking up behind me and grabbing my hand as I pause at the bottom of the stairs . “
95606	95709	95710	95710	They	1925	” she whispers . I do n’t know where we ’re going . I do n’t care . Five minutes ago , she was watching my family like she was in heaven and could n’t wait to get to know everyone and would be opening up the pool and the bar and ordering in everyone ’s favorite foods and six dozen of her other friends for a massive Welcome to Miami party . And now she ’s here . With me . Just the two of us . While double the grandmas and quadruple the aunts stand between Remy and Imogen Carter . “
95716	95731	95710	95710	They	1925	” I ask her while she drags me down the hallway toward her lounges . “
95788	95789	95790	95790	Daisy	155	” “
95792	95793	95795	95795	I	2293	” “
95840	95921	95832	95832	I	2293	” Hells to the YEAH ! my balls roar . I tell them not to get too excited . But she ’s here . When she could be with a half - dozen other people , soaking in all those vibes her extroverted personality needs . She turns into the trampoline room , drags me inside with her , throws the doors shut , and then releases my hand to shove a chair under the door handle . She frowns . “
95929	95930	95832	95832	I	2293	” “
95935	95936	95832	95832	I	2293	” “
95941	95974	95832	95832	I	2293	” She moves the chair away , twists the lock on the doorknob , and then turns . And leaps . That ’s Daisy . I ’m laughing as I catch her . “
95980	96075	95832	95832	I	2293	” she orders while she peppers my cheeks with kisses . This is the weirdest of her lounges . Four steps lead up to a massive floor of linked trampolines , with ball pits lining the walls that were black two days ago , but are now painted with everything from seventies - style flowers and sayings to sparkly bling to penises . I choke on a laugh , step onto the trampoline , and almost drop her . She twists around , grins at the wall of dicks , and then shimmies down . “
96090	96110	95832	95832	I	2293	” She takes off , bouncing like a madwoman , and I follow . Fuck , this is fun . “
96118	96119	96120	96120	Your	1929	” “
96124	96125	96120	96120	Your	1929	” “
96130	96131	96132	96133	This one	1068	” “
96140	96213	96132	96133	This one	1068	” I feel like a teenager . Racing across a trampoline to catch a bright , happy , hilarious beam of sunshine in a short , tight , giraffe - hide - patterned skirt and a tan , expensive - looking tank top . Her light purple hair is hanging loose , her makeup is light , and her feet are bare . And my heart is carefree as a birthday balloon . “
96219	96278	96132	96133	This one	1068	” I ask as I snag her around the waist . She shrieks with laughter , tries to leap away , and instead takes both of us down . We bounce , bumping hips , and soon she ’s rolled so she ’s straddling me while the stretchy material beneath us makes everything unstable and crazy and perfect . “
96284	96296	96297	96297	I	2293	” she says , bending to brush her lips against mine . “
96310	96441	96304	96304	I	2293	” She laughs again . And I take advantage of the moment to kiss her . Holding her face to mine , inhaling that laughter , swiping my tongue over her lower lip , biting softly , exploring , tracing , just living . Tomorrow does n’t matter . Yesterday does n’t matter . Just this — kissing Daisy . On a trampoline . While she dives headfirst into kissing me back with those plump lips and quick tongue and eager hands stroking down my chest and pushing my shirt up . Her hips roll over mine , rubbing my aching cock , and I groan into her mouth . I ’ve been perpetually aroused since the moment I got here , and I do n’t have a fucking condom . “
96446	96509	96304	96304	I	2293	” she informs me as she pulls out of the kiss and rises up to strip out of her shirt . She ’s wearing a teeny tiny black lace bra that makes my cock strain harder between her thighs . I trace the cups over the swell of her breasts and sit up to suck at her nipples through the thin fabric . “
96516	96520	96514	96514	West	2385	” she gasps . “
96537	96538	96529	96530	Bad boy	1932	” “
96548	96593	96529	96530	Bad boy	1932	” She shimmies out of reach , sending both of us bouncing again , and I put a hand to her head to keep us from knocking noggins and giving each other concussions . There ’s a devious glint in her eyes , though . “
96605	96606	96598	96598	You	1932	” “
96611	96696	96697	96697	Daisy	155	” She slides the rest of the way down my bouncing body , slips a hand into my sweatpants , and frees my erection . The cool air hits it , then the heat of her fist , and then — oh , fuck , yes . Then her mouth . She kisses my tip , swirls her tongue around my head , and sucks my cock all the way to the back of her throat , her wet , hot mouth fucking heaven . “
96699	96886	96887	96887	Daisy	155	” I gasp . She presses on the trampoline on either side of my hips , and rides with me while I bounce . I start to protest , but then she cups my tight balls while she pulls off my cock , swirls her tongue around my head again , and then sucks me back down , and I ca n’t speak . I can just feel . The thick , heavy sensation in my cock warning me that I ca n’t hold out . The warning , warning buzzing in the fuzzy recesses of my brain , declaring that this is not a safe place to get a blow job , but it ’s drowned out by the sight of those blue , blue eyes boring into mine . Sit back and enjoy this , Marine . I do n’t know if that ’s Daisy or my balls talking , but christ , her mouth — and her tongue suckling the underside of my dick — and her joy , her spirit , her determination to make me feel good — fuck . Fuck . “
96896	97046	96889	96889	I	2293	” There ’s a glint in her eyes , and she sucks me harder , and suddenly I ’m coming down her throat in a white - hot flash of sensation that makes my fingers and toes tingle and my legs and stomach tighten and my heart swell . So much — so much sensation . Physical . Emotional . Spiritual . She strokes my legs while she sucks down my climax , and my heart waves a white flag . We ’re done . We surrender . There have been no women before Daisy Carter - Kincaid , and there will be no women after who have or will ever completely capture me , body , heart , and soul . My body goes limp , and she slides off my cock with a soft pop , then kisses my tip and tucks me back into my pants . “
97053	97077	97047	97047	You	1933	” she whispers as she crawls back on top of me , the world tilting and rolling as the trampoline adjusts beneath us . “
97088	97129	97078	97078	I	2293	” I pant . She grins , squeezing her arms together to make her cleavage more pronounced , and fuck , I ’m getting hard again . How does she do that ? I trace the line between her breasts . “
97153	97176	97078	97078	I	2293	” I brush a thumb over her heart , then her temple . Her eyes go shiny , and she blinks quickly . “
97189	97201	97181	97181	You	1933	” I roll and pin her beneath me on the trampoline . “
97213	97237	97202	97203	Sex goddesses	1934	” She squirms , and I start to lift off her , but she grabs me around the ribs and holds me tight . “
97251	97255	97202	97203	Sex goddesses	1934	” she grumbles . “
97262	97267	97256	97256	I	2293	” One brow arches . “
97281	97282	97268	97269	Westley Jaeger	104	” “
97296	97297	97286	97287	the lady	1935	” “
97323	97324	97313	97313	Your	1936	” “
97331	97341	97313	97313	Your	1936	” I correct . She heaves an exaggerated sigh . “
97346	97358	97313	97313	Your	1936	” I nip at her ear , and she hums happily . “
97370	97374	97313	97313	Your	1936	” I whisper . “
97378	97379	97313	97313	Your	1936	” “
97394	97487	97386	97386	I	2293	” She eyes me warily . Like she does n’t like that we ’re heading into personal territory . But I do n’t just want her body . I want her mind . And her heart . And I want her to know she can trust me with all of her . That I ’m safe . I wo n’t hurt her . Something flickers in those blue eyes , and then the willpower and determination kick in . Like this is one more challenge . And she ’s up for it . “
97497	97502	97488	97488	I	2293	” she says softly . “
97506	97523	97524	97524	You	1938	” Her eyes flare wide for half a second . I grin . She cracks up . “
97528	97547	97524	97524	You	1938	” I rock until she releases me , then leap off her and take off on the trampoline . “
97573	97582	97558	97558	she	1939	” I call while she chases after me . “
97610	97611	97612	97612	She	380	” “
97629	97630	97612	97612	She	380	” “
97660	97661	97652	97652	I	2293	” “
97677	97750	97751	97751	I	2293	” Fuck , this is fun . I dive off the trampoline and into one of the ball pits , and Daisy shrieks and comes bouncing after me , her breasts barely contained in that little black bra , her legs constricted by the skirt , but her cheeks are flushed and she ’s laughing as she leaps like she ’s drunk and finally lands in the massive ball pit with me . “
97782	97808	97768	97768	I	2293	” she says . I ’m wading through the balls , diving like I ’m in a pool , pretending I ’m running from her . “
97817	97824	97811	97811	We	1944	” I concede with a grin . “
97872	97873	97857	97858	Taylor Swift	355	” “
97885	97903	97857	97858	Taylor Swift	355	” Her eyes flare again , and then she falls over backward in the balls , laughing . “
97931	97932	97923	97923	you	1945	” “
97951	98045	97943	97943	I	2293	” I stand up straight , swing my hips like I ’m dancing to bad music on a porn video , and make a show of lifting my shirt until I whip it the rest of the way off , swing it like a lasso over my head , and toss it to her . Just like I wanted to the night we met . She snags it and pulls it to her nose , and fuck , I ’m full - mast again . Her eyes go dark as she watches me . “
98051	98055	98046	98046	I	2293	” she says . “
98105	98118	98129	98129	pirate	1951	” I ’m simultaneously aroused and heartbroken for her lack of confidence . “
98122	98123	98129	98129	pirate	1951	” “
98131	98153	98129	98129	pirate	1951	” I make a flying leap for her in the pit , and she shrieks , but she does n’t move . “
98157	98187	98129	98129	pirate	1951	” I repeat , trying to get a hold of her in the ball pit , which keeps shifting around us and making us both sink deeper inside it . “
98201	98228	98229	98229	I	2293	” She frowns while blue and yellow and red balls start to swallow her face , and then switches rapid - fire into several different accents . “
98269	98270	98271	98271	You	356	” “
98279	98322	98324	98324	I	2293	” She laughs , and I keep trying to grab her while we sink deeper and deeper into the cool , dark depths of the ball pit . Her arm hooks around mine , and I realize we ’ve hit the bottom . “
98338	98342	98332	98332	Emily	143	” she whispers . “
98392	98393	98394	98394	You	1955	” “
98414	98415	98394	98394	You	1955	” “
98421	98422	98394	98394	You	1955	” “
98425	98426	98394	98394	You	1955	” “
98449	98450	98431	98431	I	2293	” “
98453	98555	98431	98431	I	2293	” I ca n’t see her clearly — the light ’s dim at the bottom of a ball pit , but I find her nose with mine , and then I angle in for a kiss . And she lets me . It ’s not an I want to rip your clothes off kiss . It ’s an I love you kiss . The words scare me . I used them liberally in my younger years , and I always got burned . But Daisy — she ’s so fucking easy to love . Her big parts and her hidden parts . “
98558	98562	98431	98431	I	2293	” she whispers . “
98565	98566	98567	98567	I	2293	” “
98574	98608	98567	98567	I	2293	” I stroke a hand down her body , balls all around us , and holy fuck , she is . Butt naked . I press a trail of kisses to her jaw . “
98615	98616	98567	98567	I	2293	” “
98638	98639	98631	98631	We	1959	” “
98649	98674	98675	98675	I	2293	” She strokes a hand down my neck . Then my back . And lower , until she ’s tugging my pants down again . “
98680	98681	98675	98675	I	2293	” “
98693	98694	98689	98689	You	2293	” “
98702	98729	98697	98697	You	2293	” Her hand finds my cock , and she squeezes and strokes once , and I groan in sheer pleasure from having her hands on me . “
98747	98783	98742	98742	You	2293	” She strokes me again , and my head brushes the soft skin on her lower belly , those damn plastic balls filtering between us , and then her other hand joins in , except — “
98788	98800	98742	98742	You	2293	” I groan while she slides a condom down my length . “
98809	98894	98742	98742	You	2293	” she says , all cocky self - assurance that makes me laugh . And then I ’m sliding into her hot , slick pussy , and she ’s gasping and chanting yes , more , there , and nothing — nothing — has ever felt as right as making love to Daisy in the middle of a ball pit . I start to laugh while I pump into her , because I ’m making love to a woman in a fucking ball pit . “
98897	98908	98909	98909	We	1960	” she whispers , arching into me while I thrust . “
98917	98918	98919	98919	You	2293	” “
98933	98938	98919	98919	You	2293	” she informs me . “
98950	98989	98919	98919	You	2293	” I meet her eyes in the low light , with a fucking yellow ball between our cheeks and I realize she feels it too . The I love you that we ’re both too scared to say . “
98998	99057	99058	99058	Daisy	155	” I tell her . And then we ’re both laughing again , and I thrust deeper inside of her until we ’re not laughing anymore , until we ’re two people chasing mutual pleasure , except I ’m positive this gorgeous , amazing woman panting and writhing beneath me is holding out until I get off first . “
99060	99061	99058	99058	Daisy	155	” “
99071	99081	99058	99058	Daisy	155	” my sister Allie suddenly shrieks somewhere above us . “
99086	99185	99058	99058	Daisy	155	” Staci says dryly . I freeze . Daisy freezes . And then she squeezes my dick with her inner walls , and fuck , I ’m gon na come . Again . I pull back slowly , then push inside her while my sisters squawk about above us . If they jump in this pit , I ’m going to dismember each and every one of them . Daisy flexes her channel around me again as I bury myself fully within her , and oh , fucking glory , she ’s so tight and hot and perfect . “
99189	99194	99058	99058	Daisy	155	” she whispers desperately . “
99204	99386	99058	99058	Daisy	155	” I reach between us as I pull out , find her clit , and flick it as I drive in , and she bites my shoulder while she clenches tight and hot and hard , and suddenly I ’m coming too , stifling my groans in the crook of her neck while we climax together , hidden under layers and layers of balls , finally , finally feeling like I ’m home . Where my heart belongs . With this hilariously fun , unpredictable , chaotic woman who ’s hiding more love under all her layers than anyone I ’ve ever known , while my family tries their best to wreak more havoc above us . Daisy snort - laughs into my shoulder . And I crack up too , despite all the overwhelming sensations that are just too much around my dick right now . Dude , get us a cigarette , my nuts say . And then one of those Costco - sized boxes of condoms . Or maybe four . You know . A week ’s supply . “
99390	99396	99397	99397	I	2293	” I whisper to Daisy . “
99404	99405	99397	99397	I	2293	” “
99410	99415	99416	99416	I	2293	” she whispers back . “
99427	99449	99416	99416	I	2293	” I kiss her shoulder . Her jaw . An errant ball pit ball when I try to reach her cheek . “
99452	99463	99416	99416	I	2293	” She giggles . I stifle another snort of laughter . “
99470	99475	99416	99416	I	2293	” Keely suddenly says . “
99485	99489	99480	99480	I	2293	” Allie replies . “
99500	99501	99480	99480	I	2293	” “
99510	99514	99416	99416	I	2293	” Staci says . “
99520	99524	99416	99416	I	2293	” I call . “
99528	99529	99416	99416	I	2293	” “
99539	99543	99416	99416	I	2293	” Keely shrieks . “
99551	99555	99556	99556	Gross	358	” Brit says . “
99558	99559	99560	99560	He	358	” “
99566	99572	99573	99573	He	358	” Staci tells them all . “
99588	99589	99573	99573	He	358	” “
99595	99599	99600	99600	I	2293	” Daisy whispers . “
99612	99617	99600	99600	I	2293	” I murmur back . “
99625	99629	99630	99630	You	2293	” Allie asks . “
99640	100089	100090	100090	Daisy	1466	” I call . There ’s a beat of silence . And then a rustle of bodies moving . I tense , because I do n’t actually trust my sisters to not jump in here . But the door slams , and when all is silent for another full minute , during which Daisy runs her hands over my chest , my shoulders , my face — I finally breathe a sigh of relief . And go back to the kissing . Because I am never going to get enough of kissing Daisy . Thirty - Six Daisy West ’s family is the best ever . We spend two days hanging out and getting to know each other and wrangling the cats and playing in the pool . Between our moms and his sisters , Remy is spoiled rotten while both West and I manage to get caught up on work some too . And also sneak away to bang at every opportunity . We ’re very busy , but in the best way . I ’ve set a goal , which I emailed him about in detail , about the way we ’re going to christen every single room in my house . And it turns out , he ’s very good with executing a plan . Which does n’t surprise me in the least . This whole being in a relationship thing is new . And awesome . Finding new ways to make West smile is the best . He ’s not the grumpy , straight - laced Marine all the time . Turns out , he ’s fucking amazing at relaxing . And tolerating all the shit his sisters give him . And giving it right back . And he ’s always aware of exactly when I need something . It ’s a skill I ’m studying closely so I can figure out how to turn it on him . Late Friday , my grandmother calls — which is eight million times better than her stopping by — to tell me Margot Roderick has been arrested . I ’m still sitting at my desk in my office , staring at my phone in shock while Elvira makes herself at home on my dick rug , when West pops his head in . He ’s gotten a haircut , but it ’s not military short — just trimmed up — and it shows off the silver strands I ’ve started to notice more and more amidst all the dark brown . I love them . They ’re more evidence that he ’s seen enough of life that he knows what he ’s getting into with me . “
100092	100173	100174	100174	Froyo	359	” That ’s all he says — just my name — but it ’s everything . Are you okay ? What do you need ? What can I do ? He does n’t need to do anything — this is the kind of news I could handle on my own just fine , because I ’m an independent woman , except I do n’t want to handle it on my own . I want to decompress about it with someone . “
100177	100378	100379	100379	Margot	1466	” I ask . His face scrunches into one of those do n’t bullshit me faces , but he still strolls over to my wall of frozen yogurt , grabs two cups , and fills them both before crossing to my desk and setting them both in front of me . My windows are open , and there ’s an ocean breeze rolling in . The sun ’s starting a slow descent in the late afternoon sky . And all is right in the world . I mean , as right as it can be right now . He drops into the seat across from my desk , a dainty , round ivory spinny chair that his large , masculine frame should look ridiculous in , but he blends in everywhere from the pool to my bed to sitting under my mom ’s dick art , so I should n’t be surprised he looks right here . I take a slow bite of caramel froyo — I swear , he always knows exactly what I ’m in the mood for — and then I burst into tears , which startles the cat so badly she darts out of the room . “
100388	100450	100379	100379	Margot	1466	” I sob . West ’s eyes go wide , and then he ’s one big blur of motion , leaping across my desk , clearing the froyo without any danger of sending it flying , lifting me out of my chair , and pulling me close , my ear to his heart , his lips pressing kisses to my crown . “
100455	100459	100453	100453	Daisy	1466	” he whispers . “
100468	100597	100598	100598	I	2293	” I stop , hiccup , and do n’t even try to continue . There was so much more my grandmother said . Restraining order filings . Lawsuits . Private eye reports on Anthony Roderick . But it all comes down to one thing : Remy ’s safe . Margot ’s in jail . Anthony ’s being investigated for tax fraud , and all appearances are that he ’s fled the country . My grandmother ’s family lawyers filed to have the Rodericks ’ challenge to the will dismissed , but it ’s a mere technicality . Remy ’s safe , and he ’s ours . And the emotions are too big for me to handle on my own . The relief . The joy . The love . “
100602	100610	100598	100598	I	2293	” I babble to West ’s chest . “
100618	100619	100759	100759	she	1970	” “
100623	100739	100740	100740	You	1969	” he finishes . I nod and reach for my phone and open my email . The full message from The Dame is on top , so I click it open and pass it to him . The details — I do n’t want to think about the details . I want to go hug Remy . And my mom . And West ’s sisters and his mom . And then go tell Luna and Cam and Emily . And throw a party . And hug and kiss Remy . But more , I want to stay right here . Snuggled up to West . Except maybe naked . Out on the beach . Yes . “
100744	100753	100740	100740	You	1969	” he asks me softly . I freeze . “
100804	100808	100784	100784	She	1970	” He chuckles . “
100826	100827	100828	100828	I	2293	” “
100832	100901	100902	100902	I	2293	” I gasp and slap a hand over my mouth , because I was n’t supposed to tell him like that . There were supposed to be candles . Flowers . Peanut butter and potato chip sandwiches . Vanilla froyo , which is his favorite , sometimes with a light layer of rainbow sprinkles . And me in a hot pink teddy . His arms tighten around me . “
100909	100913	100907	100907	Daisy	1365	” he whispers . “
100945	101018	100937	100937	You	1969	” I blink up at him , and he ’s watching me with the most serious expression I ’ve seen since the night I asked him to come back and help me with Remy . He ’s offering me his whole heart . That whole , perfect , bruised but still beating , gentle giant heart . I touch his cheek . Smooth his brow . Let my fingers trace his lips . “
101025	101026	100937	100937	You	1969	” “
101032	101033	101034	101034	I	2293	” “
101038	101043	101034	101034	I	2293	” I whisper again . “
101055	101317	101051	101051	I	2293	” His smile is everything . Everything . And I ca n’t resist kissing that smile until I ’m breathless and hungry and pulling him to the floor beneath my desk to love him the way he deserves . Forever . It ’s always been for other people . But only because I had n’t yet met my West . Thirty - Seven West The only thing better than watching my baby brother kill it on the ice on a Saturday night ? Having my family — and Daisy ’s chosen family of her billionaire besties and their boyfriends — with me while we cheer and holler and raise the fucking roof in the arena while he does it . The Miami - based half of our crowd cheers for the home team too , but they also join us in celebrating Ty ’s goal in the third period . Remy ’s not a fan of all the yelling , but he loves the attention that comes from getting passed around the box to everyone who ’ll hold him , from my sisters to Daisy ’s friends ’ boyfriends . For someone as popular as she is , Daisy ’s not on her phone often . Usually just an hour a night , catching up before bedtime , unless it ’s her mom or her three best friends texting , which she ’ll answer immediately . Or me , when I ’m out on my job site , I ’ve discovered . But she keeps sneaking it out during the game . “
101323	101331	101051	101051	I	2293	” I finally ask . She grins . “
101345	101393	101339	101339	You	1974	” And see I do . Once we ’re back home , after the game , she disappears into her closet and returns a minute later in a little glitter bikini that matches her sparkly gold hair this week . She shoves my board shorts at me . “
101400	101408	101409	101409	You	1974	” I ask with a brow wiggle . “
101422	101426	101409	101409	You	1974	” She winks . “
101432	101433	101409	101409	You	1974	” “
101439	101440	101441	101442	Whole family	2179	” “
101451	101524	101445	101448	a few more friends	1976	” I drop trou and fling my shirt off . Daisy ’s eyes go dark . And we ’re fifteen minutes late to the party . We hit the pool hand - in - hand , Daisy carrying Remy and both of us wearing I refuse to feel guilty for why I ’m late grins on our faces . But it ’s not just family . It ’s a whole freaking party . “
101527	101581	101445	101448	a few more friends	1976	” Tyler crows from the edge of the pool . Three of his teammates rush him — Zeus and Ares Berger , two massive brutes , along with Nick Murphy , the team ’s goalie — and they toss him in . Then they trade glances , and the loudest Berger twin yells , “
101584	101779	101780	101780	Westley	104	” and all three go flying into the pool , followed by a guy I ’ve seen in the neighborhood . My sisters shriek and dive for cover . Their husbands and kids — the ones old enough to be awake — are all laughing and diving in too . So ’s my dad , who flew down this morning to join us . Six cats yowl and dart out from their hiding spots in the bushes around the pool . There ’s tropical island music playing . Burgers grilling , courtesy of Derek . Beck and Jude are hanging with him in the outdoor kitchen , both with beers . One of Daisy ’s security guys is manning a bar . My mom ’s riding the mechanical unicorn that I thought Daisy was kidding about , while Cam stands to the side and hits buttons on her phone , making the unicorn go slower or faster while Mom yells to Allie to get it all on film ! The cats are all prowling about , sniffing curiously and then dodging back inside through the cat doors Daisy had me install throughout the complex . “
101782	101841	101842	101842	Fatherhood	362	” Tyler crows again . He climbs out of the pool , dripping wet , and smothers me in a hug that ends with some pumping on my back that makes me realize I need to get back to the gym . Little fucker ’s gon na be able to beat me in arm - wrestling too soon . “
101850	101854	101848	101848	dude	1346	” he says . “
101861	101908	101909	101910	Tyler Jaeger	598	” I reply . He lets out a war cry , bends , grabs me in a fireman hold , and the next thing I know , I ’m going into the pool too . That ’s fine . I ’ll let him have this one . “
101912	101955	101909	101910	Tyler Jaeger	598	” Daisy exclaims as I ’m coming up for air . She ’s handed Remy off to one of my sisters , and I have no doubt the kid ’s going to be passed around from person to person all night long . “
101961	101965	101909	101910	Tyler Jaeger	598	” He grins . “
101983	102006	101975	101975	I	2293	” She gets him by the ear , twists , and shoves him into the pool . Then she dusts her hands . “
102014	102020	102012	102012	baby	598	” she calls to me . “
102029	102030	102031	102031	She	1982	” “
102037	102068	102031	102031	She	1982	” Zeus Berger says behind me while Daisy makes an Olympics - worthy splash . Ares Berger , equally large as his twin , is grinning and shaking his head . “
102079	102090	102091	102091	You	598	” Nick Murphy , the Thrusters ’ goalie , says . “
102107	102140	102094	102094	She	1983	” Ares dunks him . Then dunks Nick . Then Tyler . Then the dark - haired , familiar dude whose chin seems to be sparkling . I hold out a fist . “
102143	102208	102094	102094	She	1983	” He dunks me too . I surface with a sputtering laugh . The crowd ’s growing , with more people from the neighborhood coming in . I do n’t recognize everyone , but I ’m sure Daisy does . I get a glimpse of Remy , currently being held by Beck while Luna melts into a pile of lust and adoration beside him . “
102212	102217	102094	102094	She	1983	” Zeus suddenly hollers . “
102242	102274	102238	102238	twins	1987	” They bump fists and take off for my twin nieces , who are floating in miniature unicorns . Daisy surfaces next to me and wraps her arms around my waist . “
102300	102301	102287	102287	I	2293	” “
102306	102315	102316	102316	I	2293	” Ty puts a hand to his heart . “
102323	102324	102316	102316	I	2293	” “
102343	102368	102337	102337	you	1989	” Staci pipes up from her spot at the edge of the pool , where she ’s twirling her youngest in a floatie too . “
102386	102387	102376	102376	We	1992	” “
102396	102401	102376	102376	We	1992	” Daisy tells her . “
102404	102416	102376	102376	We	1992	” she mutters . Keely cackles . Tyler pumps a fist . “
102426	102458	102421	102421	Javi	363	” My brother - in - law flashes a thumbs - up from across the pool , where he has their second - youngest and is teaching him how to swim . “
102462	102489	102421	102421	Javi	363	” Mom crows before she goes flying off the bucking unicorn and lands with a perfect tuck - and - roll on the mats surrounding it . “
102493	102500	102501	102502	Your family	2746	” Allie replies with a laugh . “
102507	102512	102501	102502	Your family	2746	” Daisy sighs happily . “
102516	102524	102501	102502	Your family	2746	” Emily plops down next to Staci . “
102535	102536	102526	102526	you	1994	” “
102546	102569	102526	102526	you	1994	” Staci replies . Luna sits on her other side , hair braided down her back , bangles covering her slender wrists . “
102584	102648	102649	102649	Daisy	155	” My sisters all gather around Daisy ’s friends , everyone chatting while the Berger twins and Nick Murphy and Ty climb up onto unicorn rafts and each grab one of my nieces or nephews for a squeal - fest of unicorn jousting . Derek serves up burgers . Helene sits in one of the pool chairs with a plate of street tacos . “
102668	102669	102670	102670	Costco	364	” “
102672	102683	102670	102670	Costco	364	” Daisy calls . Every one of my sisters gasps . “
102693	102702	102705	102705	Mom	380	” Helene asks her daughter . Daisy grins . “
102713	102714	102715	102715	You	1998	” “
102720	102724	102715	102715	You	1998	” Staci whispers . “
102734	102735	102736	102736	I	2293	” “
102740	102744	102748	102748	peasants	2000	” Brit breathes . “
102750	102754	102748	102748	peasants	2000	” Zeus yells . “
102763	102898	102748	102748	peasants	2000	” My niece Mia squeals in delight . Some of the older nieces and nephews leap into the pool to try to knock Tyler off his raft . Elvira circles the pool like she ’s thinking of claiming another floatie for herself . And I wrap my arms around Daisy ’s shoulders and lean against the wall of the pool while she leans against me . Family . Fun . Friendship . This is what I want every day for the rest of my life . Remy growing up surrounded by love and happiness and having no boundaries on how far he can go . Waking up every morning in Daisy ’s bed . Mom pops up behind us and sits at the edge of the pool along with the rest of the line . “
102904	102905	102901	102902	the baby	2188	” “
102915	102927	102908	102908	We	2002	” I peer around the pool area , looking for him . “
102946	102947	102941	102941	I	2293	” “
102963	102973	102976	102976	Daisy	1365	” Daisy tells her . Mom bursts into tears . “
102978	102989	102976	102976	Daisy	1365	” Allie says , and she bursts into tears too . “
102992	102996	102976	102976	Daisy	1365	” Zeus says . “
102999	103003	102976	102976	Daisy	1365	” Murphy yells . “
103007	103015	102976	102976	Daisy	1365	” Oscar and Javi both groan together . “
103020	103028	103031	103031	I	2293	” Daisy spins and stares at me . “
103034	103035	103031	103031	I	2293	” “
103042	103046	103031	103031	I	2293	” I shrug . “
103061	103062	103057	103057	they	2006	” “
103074	103078	103069	103069	I	2293	” she whispers . “
103083	103089	103090	103090	I	2293	” Luna wipes her eyes . “
103094	103095	103096	103096	Daisy	1365	” “
103107	103124	103096	103096	Daisy	1365	” Emily asks . She , too , appears to be on the verge of crying . “
103128	103257	103096	103096	Daisy	1365	” Daisy yells . My mom and sisters cry harder . Daisy bursts into tears . All of the hockey players paddle for the deep end . Except Tyler , who falls off his raft laughing . I catch his eye , and I almost double over too . I love these women . All of them . Even when they drive me nuts , they ’re all heart . And they ’re all climbing into the pool for one big group hug . With Daisy at the center . Finally getting all the love she deserves . I sweep another look around , peering for whoever has Remy , and I spot Helene instead , who ’s also wiping her eyes , and I watch her lips . “
103268	103273	103262	103262	her	2008	” she says quietly . “
103300	103301	103292	103292	I	2293	” “
103316	103419	103308	103308	she	2008	” I push out of the pool , because I ca n’t see Remy . None of my sisters have him . None of the billionaires . None of their significant others . Where the fuck is my baby ? Alessandro meets my eye , sweeps a look around the pool , frowns , and disappears into Daisy ’s private wing of the house , lifting a walkie - talkie to his mouth . My veins ice over . I do n’t stop to towel off , but instead head toward where Alessandro just disappeared , eyes roaming , looking , watching . “
103425	103448	103449	103449	Somebody	365	” I ask Jude as I pass him . He makes a sweep of the patio , then leaps to his feet . “
103455	103565	103449	103449	Somebody	365	” Beck and Derek join us as the bartender touches his earpiece and looks straight at me . My heart leaps into mission mode , except this is n’t get the job done . This is what the fuck ? I turn and scan the party on the deck again , this time catching Daisy ’s eye in the pool . Her smile freezes , and suddenly , she turns in a circle . Then another circle . There ’s no baby down here . There ’s no baby down here . She goes white as a ghost . She knows too . Alessandro steps out of her door . “
103568	103727	103449	103449	Somebody	365	” I ask him . He shakes his head tightly and says something else into his walkie - talkie . Maybe Alessandro overlooked him . Maybe someone in my family put him in the crib in the Strawberry Daiquiri suite . Maybe one of the hockey players Daisy invited wanted baby snuggles inside . Maybe one of my older nieces or nephews wanted a few minutes alone with him . He ’s safe . Margot Roderick is in jail , being held without bond . Anthony Roderick is supposedly out of the country . Supposedly . It ’s not enough . It ’s not enough , and after stopping the party and searching everywhere , it ’s clear . Remy ’s gone . I swore I ’d protect him , and he ’s gone . Thirty - Eight Daisy I ca n’t dial my phone . I ca n’t send a text . I ca n’t stop shaking . “
103738	103749	103731	103731	friends	2184	” I tell the police officer for the sixth time . “
103757	103889	103750	103750	I	2293	” Alessandro and West are talking to another officer . They ’re calm . Collected . Except for that flutter in West ’s neck . He ’s freaking the fuck out . As he should . And it ’s my fault . All my fault . How old am I ? How long have I lived with people who would use their money to buy anything and everything , from call girls to favors from tax officials to fucking hit men ? Of course Remy ’s not here . I threw a party , because that ’s all I do . I throw parties . I make people like me . And it distracted all of us to the point that we gave the Rodericks the perfect opportunity to sneak in . “
103895	103899	103892	103893	a kidnapper	2019	” I whisper . “
103917	103956	103906	103906	he	2019	” None of the men in the room — not the officers , not West , not Alessandro , and not Jude , who ’s in the corner waiting for orders on how to help — contradict me . “
103963	103968	103969	103969	He	2019	” Alessandro tells me . “
103983	103984	103985	103985	Cam	147	” “
103992	103997	103985	103985	Cam	147	” Jude tells me . “
104015	104016	103985	103985	Cam	147	” “
104023	104031	104032	104032	They	2021	” one of the officers tells me . “
104045	104061	104062	104062	I	2293	” My little baby . He ’s so helpless . And little . And alone . “
104072	104090	104091	104091	Daisy	1466	” I barely whisper it , but suddenly West is there , wrapping me in his arms . “
104093	104094	104091	104091	Daisy	1466	” “
104097	104102	104103	104103	I	2293	” I shake free . “
104143	104144	104145	104145	We	2033	” “
104156	104157	104145	104145	We	2033	” “
104196	104197	104198	104198	We	2033	” “
104209	104214	104198	104198	We	2033	” the officer starts . “
104226	104388	104222	104222	He	2037	” I fly into motion , because I ca n’t stand still . Remy ’s out there somewhere . He ’s out there , and I have to find him . Not for Julienne . Not for my grandmother . For me . He ’s mine . Mine to love . Mine to raise . Mine to save . I do n’t care how he came to be here in my life . Or how much sleep I lose , or how many dirty diapers I have to change , because that gummy smile — that sweet , innocent adoration , that happy coo , his chubby little face when he ’s falling asleep on a bottle , the way I swear he ’s trying to tell me stories every morning — he ’s become my everything . I ca n’t imagine a day without him . West falls into step next to me as I head for my shoe closet . “
104395	104431	104389	104389	I	2293	” And there ’s the other half of my everything . The one I ’ve let down so very , very badly . It was bound to happen sooner or later , was n’t it ? “
104434	104438	104439	104439	We	2038	” I say . “
104450	104451	104443	104443	We	2038	” “
104460	104461	104443	104443	We	2038	” “
104465	104469	104443	104443	We	2038	” Jude agrees . “
104474	104475	104472	104472	Cam	147	” “
104481	104521	104522	104522	I	2293	” I shove my feet into my favorite stilettos , then remember how my last trip through the sand on stilettos went , and I mutter to myself and grab my black - and - white checked Sketchers instead . “
104528	104549	104550	104550	Daisy	1466	” I tell them . West and Jude share a look , and West falls into step on my heels . “
104552	104553	104550	104550	Daisy	1466	” “
104566	104982	104983	104983	Daisy	1466	” My pulse is on hyperdrive . I ca n’t feel my feet . And I ca n’t stop wondering if Remy ’s crying . If he knows what ’s going on . If he ’s scared . I take the back staircase and land on the beach , scanning the horizon for ship lights . Boat lights . I ’ve docked right up on this beach in a dinghy before . It ’s possible . Which means anyone could ’ve been hiding in the mangroves between our properties , just waiting for a chance to sneak in . West does n’t speak while we go up and down the beach . Around the paths between my house , Luna ’s house , Cam ’s house , and Emily ’s house , and repeat . Checking bushes . Flashing lights into the mangroves . Searching . Fruitlessly . His phone dings . My phone dings . Always the same . No news . You ? From Cam and Jude . Derek and Emily . Luna and Beck . All of their security . West ’s family . Residents in Bluewater who woke up at the SOS . Tyler and his teammates join in too — they’re not flying home until morning , and all of them claim they do n’t need sleep . They ’re as bad as I am . Around two AM , though , I finally break . I ’ve lost my baby . I drop to the ground in the sand behind my pool house and I let the sobs overtake me . West sits next to me , and even though I know he ’s hurting too , that he ’s panicked too , that I promised him I ’d never hurt him , that I ’d take care of him , I let him take care of me . This is what I do . I let people down . I play a good game . I pretend I ’m worthy . I pretend I can do it . But when push comes to shove , I ca n’t keep up . His phone dings . My phone dings . I ignore it , because I know what it says . No news . You ? Maybe , You need to keep your energy up . Stop by my house for kombucha . Because that ’s so Luna . Thinking of getting us strength in every holistic way possible . “
104985	104990	104991	104991	He	2041	” West chokes out . “
104995	105011	104991	104991	He	2041	” My head whips up so fast I almost crack my skull into his face . “
105014	105015	105016	105016	He	2041	” “
105020	105100	105016	105016	He	2041	” He turns his phone so I can see , and there he is . Remy . Wearing the sailor pajamas I put him in before bed . Screaming himself red in the face . Clutched in Beck ’s arms . I leap to my feet , relief and dread coursing through my veins . Relief , because he ’s safe . Dread , because I know what I have to do to make sure he stays that way . “
105103	105122	105016	105016	He	2041	” West grabs my hand and tugs me up the beach to the back of my pool house . “
105141	105274	105131	105131	They	2044	” The next ten minutes are the longest ten minutes of my life . I ca n’t get through my house fast enough . It ’s too big . Too much . Too unnecessary . I burst out the front door , and I head down my driveway , West right beside me , even though it hurts to have him here , because I do n’t deserve him either . I ca n’t drive . I can barely walk straight . But I keep going until the flash of headlights shines over me . I squint , watching as Cam ’s souped - up golf cart slows , then stops . Jude ’s driving . And Cam — She ’s in the passenger seat . With Remy cradled in her arms . “
105283	105287	105288	105288	He	2045	” I gasp . “
105292	105302	105303	105303	He	2045	” Cam confirms , handing me the sleeping bundle . “
105308	105318	105303	105303	He	2045	” She wraps her arms around me and Remy . “
105329	105424	105323	105323	Daisy	1365	” A Range Rover stops behind the cart , and more of my friends and half of West ’s family descend on us . Police cruisers follow . I squeeze Remy tight and lean into Cam while West strokes my hair , letting all the sobs fall out while I soak in every second — every millisecond — of this moment . Holding my little boy . The one who was never supposed to be mine , but who stole my heart , completely , with that gummy smile and pure , simple acceptance . “
105430	105434	105435	105435	I	2293	” I whisper . “
105442	105601	105602	105602	Daisy	1365	” I will . I know exactly how I ’ll do better . And it ’s going to hurt like hell . But for Remy ’s sake , I have to . Thirty - Nine West Relief is n’t the right word . Even though he was only missing for three , maybe four hours , having Remy home feels like having my whole fucking life saved . Like I ’ve stood on the edge of the cliff , on crumbling rocks that could truly destroy me the way Sierra could n’t , the way Becca could n’t , the way losing most of my hearing in my right ear could n’t , and staring into true , bleak , empty desolation . This baby might not have been born mine , but he ’s mine in every way that counts . He ’s mine in my heart . Just like the woman standing guard at his crib . “
105613	105781	105782	105782	Daisy	1365	” I can hear the exhaustion in my own voice , but I know that ’s not why she shakes her head . She feels the responsibility every bit as much as I do . The guilt . The remnants of the fear . The knowledge that if we had n’t realized he was gone as fast as we did , tonight could ’ve ended very , very differently . I wo n’t convince her to go to bed . And so I do the next best thing , and I wrap my arms around her , and I stand there with her . For the rest of the night . Keeping watch . I think Daisy might actually fall asleep on her feet for a while , but when the first light of dawn breaks through her gauzy curtains , she straightens and pulls back with a look of sheer determination on her face that makes my heart stop . And not in a good way . “
105784	105785	105786	105786	I	2293	” “
105809	105814	105800	105800	you	2046	” Her voice cracks . “
105819	105820	105800	105800	you	2046	” “
105823	105824	105825	105825	Daisy	1365	” “
105827	105828	105825	105825	Daisy	1365	” “
105831	105854	105825	105825	Daisy	1365	” No , my heart screams . Because I know this look . This is the look of a woman pulling away . “
105861	105872	105873	105873	I	2293	” I tell her as she walks to the bathroom . “
105876	105877	105878	105878	Daisy	1365	” “
105880	105881	105882	105882	I	2293	” “
105934	106541	105931	105931	I	2293	” I let her go , because I do n’t have any more good arguments to keep her . And half an hour later , when she emerges from the bathroom , and I ’m feeding Remy a bottle in the rocking chair , she kisses me softly on the cheek , then kisses him seven times on his head and cheeks . And it feels like a fucking goodbye . I tell myself it ’s not . That she needs time to process . Hell , I need time to process . Sleep would help . Her , I mean . I do n’t need sleep . I ’m a fucking Marine . A retired Marine whose mother is n’t even the fussiest person to fuss over me this morning when Remy and I make our way to the kitchen for breakfast . No , that designation goes to Helene . She looks like she has n’t slept either , and she insists on making me an omelet , then plain scrambled eggs when the omelet turns out like shit , and then asks for my to - go order from Carbs ’ n Coffee since she actually ca n’t cook . Her words . My sisters wo n’t give me enough space . And I ’m okay with that this morning . We video chat with Tyler , who ’s on a plane back to Virginia . All of his teammates — all of them — insist on seeing Remy for themselves , which results in all of my nieces and nephews insisting on talking to all the hockey players , and Daisy ’s kitchen turns into one big massive pit of noise that I love as much as I hate . We spend almost all day in there . And because I ’m not a fool , I give her space . Daisy ’s not in the house . Helene says she went to her office . She hugs me . A lot . I tell myself that ’s not a sign , but come on . I ’ve done this dance before . I know when a woman ’s gotten skittish . But I do n’t know how to fix this . Promise Daisy it ’ll never happen again ? I ca n’t . Neither of us can physically keep an eye on Remy twenty - four hours a day . I can call in friends , but she has a seven - person security team here already . We ca n’t post a guard on him his entire life . He needs freedom . Room to grow . To explore . And he ca n’t get that so long as the Rodericks are a threat . The police confirmed that the kidnapper named Anthony Roderick as the man who hired him . Anthony Roderick , the asshole who once made Daisy so uncomfortable — she has n’t told me that story yet — that he was already on the list of people not allowed in Bluewater . Anthony Roderick , who ’s a free man , hiding somewhere that the law ca n’t reach him . Which means the only thing I can do is end the threat . I know how to end a threat . I ’ve been ending threats for twenty years . Daisy ’s friends drop by mid - afternoon with their boyfriends , and while they all coo and fuss over the baby — yes , all of them — I jerk my head at Jude . He and I have a few things in common . “
106544	106561	105931	105931	I	2293	” he says without preamble when we step to the side of the sunken sitting room . “
106578	106579	106580	106580	I	2293	” “
106584	106618	106580	106580	I	2293	” He pulls out a phone and texts someone . On one of the couches , Derek looks up from the baby , checks his phone , then nods to Jude . Fuckers . “
106631	106637	106623	106623	I	2293	” I mutter to him . “
106654	106655	106638	106638	You	2053	” “
106662	106679	106638	106638	You	2053	” Keely leaps over to me and tackles me with a hug before Jude can answer . “
106697	106698	106688	106688	I	2293	” “
106706	106806	106807	106807	Quit	367	” Staci calls . Remy erupts in a wail . And that ’s my boy . My eyes get hot . We almost lost him last night . I did n’t even know him a few weeks ago , and my world would ’ve fallen apart if he had n’t been found . He ’s not just my responsibility . He ’s a bright spot in my life . Which is n’t that much of a surprise — I could tell myself all I wanted that I would n’t get attached , but I knew it was a lie . “
106815	106993	106807	106807	Quit	367	” I tell Brit . Her finger flies to her nose . My sisters all follow suit immediately , then my mom , and my dad . My brothers - in - law . Even my youngest nieces and nephews . And I do n’t care if I have to change a messy diaper . I ’d do anything for this kid . Anything . I take him upstairs — to Daisy ’s room , not the guest room , because until she tells me we ’re done , I ’m carrying on like normal . And our normal is me in her bedroom . Hell , even after she tells me we ’re done , I ’m carrying on like normal . I wo n’t give up on her . And that ’s exactly what I ’m telling myself when I leave her private wing and head back downstairs , carrying a fussy Remy who ’s probably ready for a bottle . But I do n’t make it to the kitchen . Because Alessandro corners me . “
107003	107107	106994	106994	She	2055	” I square my shoulders . Ignore the look of pity on his face . And head in to let her do her worst . Forty Daisy When West walks in with Remy , I almost break . The man ’s face is set fierce and determined , like he knows what ’s coming , and he ’s prepared to fight me the whole time . He ’s carrying the baby face - out , and that little face twists in a smile and almost breaks me . But I have to do what ’s best for him . For both of them . “
107112	107156	106994	106994	She	2055	” I point to the ivory chairs opposite my desk and push up my reading glasses , which are n’t actually reading glasses , but I feel like a badass with eye protection when I ’m wearing them . He ignores my directive . “
107165	107208	106994	106994	She	2055	” I could waste time quibbling with him over what this is , but the sooner I rip off the Band - Aid , the better . So instead , I push a small stack of paperwork across my desk toward him . “
107228	107247	107220	107220	He	1365	” He sucks in a breath and drops to the chair , and I have to look away . “
107250	107251	107220	107220	He	1365	” “
107261	107262	107220	107220	He	1365	” “
107265	107266	107220	107220	He	1365	” “
107322	107323	107316	107316	you	2060	” “
107343	107344	107345	107345	I	2293	” “
107459	107681	107450	107450	I	2293	” God , my heart hurts . And I hate lying to West , but I know if I told him the truth — that I ’m a fucked - up basket case who will one day leave Remy a fucked - up basket case too — he’d try to convince me that I ’m wrong . That he can fix me . That we can manage the attention . That we can keep Remy safe . The only thing that will keep Remy safe is me removing myself from the situation so that West can take him somewhere far , far from here , and raise him quietly with lots of family around . And I only partially mean physically safe . Mostly , I mean safe from the influence of my grandmother that I ’ll inadvertently pass on to him , despite what I plan to do next . I could move halfway around the globe , change my name , change my face , change my hair , my boobs , everything , and I ’d still be 25 % Imogen Carter . And that ’s too much to inflict on one more generation . Remy needs to be free . West ’s gaze bores into me with the force of a million sea - green ocean tides . “
107689	107700	107450	107450	I	2293	” I tell him with a nod at the paperwork . “
107720	107731	107713	107713	I	2293	” Dammit , I hate it when my voice cracks . “
107740	107741	107713	107713	I	2293	” “
107752	107762	107713	107713	I	2293	” And there goes the stinging in my eyes . “
107774	107971	107713	107713	I	2293	” I rise . My knees wobble . My heart cracks open and spills out rotten rainbow sprinkles that are infected with a double dose of cynicism and hopelessness . If I ’m one - quarter Imogen Carter , I ’m also fifty percent cheating bastard — and I do mean bastard in all the ways one can mean bastard — and that ’s nothing to be proud of either . I ’ve never let a man into my heart the way I ’ve let West in , because my genes are corrupt . Watching him walk away will hurt every bit as much as letting Remy go . But I ca n’t be what he needs either . We ’re in this honeymoon phase . I ’m playing at having a family . But I ’ll get bored . He ’ll get tired of my constant need for new entertainment . At me wanting to go out at night . Just because I ’ve felt more like staying in with him lately does n’t mean it ’ll last . It ’s better to let him go now . Before either of us get more attached . “
108012	108013	108003	108003	I	2293	” “
108022	108084	108003	108003	I	2293	” His voice is hoarse , and I want to stop and fling myself at him and promise him promises that I ca n’t keep . Because any other man would ask why are you doing this to me ? But not West . Even while I ’m throwing daggers at him , he ’s asking why I ’m hurting myself . “
108092	108125	108089	108090	Mr. Jaeger	104	” And I ’m going to lose all of my willpower to do what ’s best for both of them if I do n’t leave . Right now . Forty - One Daisy “
108143	108164	108089	108090	Mr. Jaeger	104	” Tiana informs me as she follows me out the side door of my mansion to my waiting Daisy Wagon . “
108167	108303	108304	108304	Alessandro	2859	” I ’m in big Tiffany sunglasses . Bright yellow Versace dress . Stilettos . Diamonds . My hair swept up like Jackie O. Lips red . Lashes thick and dark . Eyes smoky . I ’m dressed to fucking crush the world , and all I really want to do is curl up in my bed and eat froyo until I cry myself out . Girls like me do n’t get the man , the babies , the white picket fence . We get the parties . The superficial . The mansion on the beach and the reputation for being the nice person among the rich assholes . Fuck that . I do n’t want it anymore . I step into my Beetle , cross my legs , and look away from my house . “
108314	108332	108304	108304	Alessandro	2859	” He meets Tiana ’s gaze in the rearview mirror , then shifts his attention to me . “
108343	108344	108304	108304	Alessandro	2859	” “
108368	108508	108509	108509	You	2070	” It ’s a quiet hour drive to South Beach after that , full of shitty drivers , horns honking , stop - and - go traffic , and more indigestion than I ’d wish on three - quarters of my worst enemies . Anthony Roderick can have six times this amount of indigestion . And jock itch to boot . And all his nose and pubic hairs plucked out by a monkey with a rusty pair of pliers . And lice in his ear hairs . We pull up to The Dame ’s hacienda , and I do n’t wait for Pierson to greet me at the door . I also do n’t wait to be told where to find my grandmother . I know . And I ’m not surprised to find her working in her office . “
108521	108541	108542	108542	I	2293	” she says . No hello . No are you okay ? Just you did it wrong , Daisy . “
108545	108557	108542	108542	I	2293	” Her eyes flare wide and her mouth forms a silent O. “
108581	108788	108789	108789	Daisy	1365	” God , my heart . But I wo n’t subject either one of them to this anymore . Or myself . And I wo n’t use them as a crutch either . I wo n’t let them be my easy family . The one that Julienne ’s will gave me . They deserve more than me being there simply because they ’re convenient , and they deserve better than me . The me I am today , anyway . Even if I feel like there are icy daggers shredding into my chest and pecking away at my newly exposed heart . Maybe I ’ll never build skyscrapers in Hong Kong again . Maybe my line of spas for Carter International Properties will all close because the curtains are mango instead of cerulean . Or whatever . But I am not worthless . And I wo n’t sit here and let her make me think I am for one more minute . The Dame rises to her full height . If she were truly an immortal highland vampire dragon , she ’d spit fire out her nostrils and crack open her old lady shell to reveal her true form , an armor - plated flying cockroach . “
108791	108795	108789	108789	Daisy	1365	” she whispers . “
108802	108845	108800	108800	Daisy	1365	” My knees wobble , because she ’s not breathing fire or using her powers of mind control to bend me double in pain . Instead , she seems utterly gobsmacked . In a lesser woman , I ’d call her stricken . “
108849	108857	108800	108800	Daisy	1365	” I say , my voice quivering . “
108866	108877	108878	108878	You	2229	” She slowly shakes her head , eyes still wide . “
108887	108918	108880	108880	Daisy	1365	” She swallows , and all of her armor does crack . But it ’s not a beast who emerges . It ’s a broken , old , sad woman . “
108924	108925	108880	108880	Daisy	1365	” “
108934	108935	108936	108936	I	2293	” “
108948	108952	108953	108953	You	2229	” I freeze . “
108959	108960	108953	108953	You	2229	” “
108987	108988	108984	108985	Mr. Jaeger	104	” “
108998	109004	109005	109005	She	97	” The Dame actually blanches . “
109016	109035	109005	109005	She	97	” I turn around and march toward the door . I do n’t want to hear any more . “
109045	109093	109094	109094	Daisy	97	” she says quietly behind me . That should mean something . It should be everything I ’ve worked my ass off for since I was twenty - one years old . But what kind of a victory is it when I do n’t want it anymore ? “
109098	109102	109094	109094	Daisy	97	” she says . “
109110	109324	109094	109094	Daisy	97	” I ignore her . I do n’t remember what my employment agreement said . Probably something about indentured servitude for life in exchange for that twenty - five percent cut I asked for . Or something about losing a share in the company if I quit before a hundred and fifty years . But I do n’t care . I have Bluewater . That ’s mine . Mine , and Emily ’s , and Luna ’s , and Cam ’s . She ca n’t take that from us . I have my pool . I have my yacht . I have my mom . I have my friends , who will undoubtedly tell me I ’m a moron for sending West away , but I had to . For his own good . For Remy ’s own good . I step back out into the sunshine , and I wait for the freedom to wash over me . It does n’t come . Not washing , anyway . But the tears do . A month ago , I would ’ve drowned myself in tequila and techno music at a club on the beach . Today , I just want to go home . Tiana and Alessandro surround me with a huge hug . “
109330	109334	109335	109335	We	2525	” I whisper . “
109344	109536	109339	109339	we	2525	” And that ’s all it takes to finally break me . Just a little bit of love . This love , I might deserve . But West ’s ? He can do so much better . Forty - Two Daisy Four days after the Weekend of Horror , as I ’m officially calling it , I ’m camped out in my pool house , contemplating not much of anything at all , because I am slobber - faced drunk . I could go fry in the sun on a float in my pool , but I do n’t want to . I want to lay here . On the cool tile floor . With my boobs squished under me and a glass of something pink and beautiful just out of reach , even with the straw teasing me mere inches away . I ’m trying to extend my lips to reach it when the door slides open and the most fabulous pair of shoes ever stop just behind the glass . Those fabulous shoes are followed by another pair of fabulous shoes , and one set of adorable bare feet . “
109541	109547	109548	109548	I	2293	” a soft voice says . “
109557	109558	109548	109548	I	2293	” “
109566	109567	109562	109562	she	1268	” “
109600	109601	109602	109602	Oga	369	” “
109605	109631	109602	109602	Oga	369	” I sigh against the floor . I have no idea what it means , but it ’s the sounds my mouth wants to make . “
109640	109641	109642	109642	I	2293	” “
109661	109662	109646	109646	she	1268	” “

109695	109699	109683	109683	he	148	” I say . “
109709	109737	109738	109738	You	2080	” Emily ’s face swims into view as she squats in front of me . She ’s so pretty . I want to be pretty like Emily . “
109743	109744	109738	109738	You	2080	” “
109754	109755	109756	109756	Daisy	1365	” “
109762	109810	109756	109756	Daisy	1365	” Luna ’s flowy , flowery skirt flares out on the ground beside my head , and she strokes my hair , which might be dangerous , since it ’s entirely possible Steve has crawled in there to bask in the glorious filth of my ’ do . “
109817	109818	109813	109813	your	2080	” “
109829	109830	109813	109813	your	2080	” “
109837	109945	109946	109946	I	2293	” Cam says . They ’re joking , so I ignore them . Except suddenly my arms and legs are being lifted , my skin is snick!-ing off the ground , and any hopes of getting that straw disappear . The sun is bright . And the water is a huge wake - up . I sputter , my head spins , and I flail around for half a second before I surface . I ’m still in my yellow Versace dress from four days ago . And I have half a mind to sink back into the water and let it carry all my troubles away . “
109951	109982	109946	109946	I	2293	” I whisper , and then I do n’t know where my eyes start and the water ends , or something like that , because my eyeballs are leaking again . “
109991	110057	109987	109987	You	2083	” All three of my friends settle in at the edge of my pool , peeling off shoes and dropping their toes in the water . Even Cam , who ’s impeccably dressed in a business suit . My friends are the best . Except for the part where they ’re making me cry . Apparently I have a touch of the dramatic in me . “
110077	110105	110068	110068	they	2084	” I wail . I fling myself backward , but I do n’t sink , because I have two giant life rafts permanently attached to my chest . “
110118	110122	110111	110111	you	2086	” Luna says . “
110151	110152	110140	110140	you	2086	” “
110158	110172	110174	110174	he	2087	” It is — it ’s both easy and so , so hard . “
110178	110234	110174	110174	he	2087	” I made Tiana tell me when she checked on me yesterday . One of the times , anyway . Apparently quitting my job does n’t mean my personal staff will quit me . My friends are oddly silent , and hope makes my heart leap . I tilt my head to look at them . “
110245	110265	110241	110241	they	2084	” They share one of those should we tell her ? looks , and Emily finally meets my eyes . “
110275	110281	110270	110270	Remy	1365	” Ah , tears again . “
110293	110297	110298	110298	I	2293	” Cam asks . “
110319	110336	110308	110308	I	2293	” I clap a hand over my mouth . I hate when the truth slips out . “
110345	110349	110308	110308	I	2293	” Luna asks . “
110355	110365	110308	110308	I	2293	” Emily smirks . Cam heaves a melodramatic sigh . “
110385	110386	110374	110374	she	2091	” “
110396	110397	110391	110391	you’re	2092	” “
110404	110409	110402	110402	Daisy	1365	” Emily says softly . “
110441	110442	110436	110436	You	2093	” “
110447	110451	110436	110436	You	2093	” Luna interrupts . “
110454	110458	110436	110436	You	2093	” Cam adds . “
110480	110481	110482	110482	I	2293	” “
110487	110491	110482	110482	I	2293	” I wail . “
110505	110543	110496	110497	Carter International	151	” Emily says casually . That has me scrambling for my feet , belatedly realizing I ’m still in my stilettos , and wondering if that ’ll leave a mark on the bottom of my dick pool . “
110546	110547	110496	110497	Carter International	151	” “
110562	110563	110550	110550	They	2096	” “
110575	110581	110568	110568	she	84	” Luna winks at me . “
110590	110604	110568	110568	she	84	” Oh , god . Oh , god . Everything is falling apart . “
110624	110634	110656	110656	Peopling	370	” And my three friends are sharing another look . “
110637	110655	110656	110656	Peopling	370	” Luna slides into the pool , dress and all , and grabs me in a hug . “
110677	110690	110670	110670	People	2202	” Cam taps her finger to her lips like she ’s thinking . “
110717	110730	110700	110700	One	778	” I freeze so hard the pool water gets frosty around me . “
110739	110743	110737	110737	Remy	1365	” I whisper . “
110752	110796	110747	110747	I	2293	” Except what was it West said ? I ’ll screw up , Daisy . You ’ll screw up . But we ’ll forgive each other . Forgiveness is n’t something my family does . But that does n’t mean I ca n’t . “
110802	110808	110799	110799	I	2293	” I ask my friends . “
110815	110816	110811	110811	I	2293	” “
110827	110842	110824	110825	Carter International	151	” Cam rubs her hands together in glee . Emily ’s eyes light up . “
110878	110879	110866	110866	She	380	” “
110894	110895	110888	110888	I	2293	” “
110900	110913	110888	110888	I	2293	” Cam grins . Emily grins bigger . Luna squeezes me tight . “
110944	110945	110928	110928	we	2107	” “
110951	110955	110956	110956	Teachers	2108	” Cam says . “
110971	110975	110962	110962	You	2106	” Emily nods . “
110986	110987	110981	110981	They	2108	” “
110995	110999	110988	110988	I	2293	” Luna adds . “
111029	111035	111008	111008	I	2293	” I splash them all . “
111042	111043	111044	111044	We	2525	” “
111050	111056	111044	111044	We	2525	” Luna squeezes me tighter . “
111073	111074	111067	111067	You	2106	” “
111081	111082	111075	111075	I	2293	” “
111088	111089	111083	111083	We	2525	” “
111096	111106	111083	111083	We	2525	” Cam asks . Am I ? Can I ? “
111119	111124	111125	111125	He	2110	” I say slowly . “
111156	111174	111177	111177	him	2110	” The way he treated me . Like I matter . My hands are starting to shake . “
111206	111207	111201	111201	I	2293	” “
111213	111218	111208	111208	You	2111	” Luna says sagely . “
111226	111233	111208	111208	You	2111	” Emily adds . Cam nods . “
111241	111265	111208	111208	You	2111	” A party with my best friends . That does sound better than wallowing in my lady cave for the next three years . “
111273	111278	111267	111267	you	2111	” Luna tells me . “
111292	111414	111417	111418	ugly motherfucker	2113	” Forty - Three West I miss being on missions , but right now , creeping through the sand , approaching a beach hut just after sunset entirely too close to Miami , getting ready to serve justice to an asshole of the nth degree , my heart is n’t in it . My heart ’s back in Miami . My entire heart . I make eye contact with Jude . He nods , and we split up . Him to the back . Me to the front . We ’re both unarmed , but we ’re plenty dangerous without traditional weapons . I crouch in position between the door and the open window , waiting . Does n’t take long . “
111420	111425	111417	111418	ugly motherfucker	2113	” Jude says inside . “
111431	111432	111417	111418	ugly motherfucker	2113	” “
111439	111573	111417	111418	ugly motherfucker	2113	” Footsteps on the wood floor . The bang of the door flying open . A man darting out . And I leap . Takes me all of a half - second to have Anthony Roderick ’s face shoved in the sand while I wrap his wrists . He ’s gasping and spitting when I lift him and shove a gag in his mouth . Jude joins me as I ’m tossing the fucker over my shoulder . Does n’t ask if this is him . Does n’t have to . We ’ve both been staring at his picture nonstop for days , and much as I swore I ’d forget the one day I met him in person , back when I was doing Remy ’s first nursery , I did n’t . “
111577	111582	111417	111418	ugly motherfucker	2113	” I growl low . “
111600	112069	111594	111594	you	2114	” He screams in terror , but it ’s muffled behind the gag . And I do n’t feel a lick of remorse . Thinks his money can buy his way out of trouble . That he ’s above the law . Sitting here on a fucking beach , in a country that does n’t give two shits that he ’s here and would n’t extradite him even if they knew , probably cooking up another scheme to kidnap my boy and whisk him away here . Am I breaking some kind of law ? Probably . Do I care ? Not . One . Fucking . Bit . Daisy wo n’t rest until this asshole is completely neutralized . I wo n’t fucking rest until this asshole is completely neutralized . So we ’re neutralizing him . And yes . My son . In all the ways that count . Our helicopter is at a makeshift landing zone three hundred yards away in a small clearing in the jungle . Jude leaps into the cockpit and starts the rotors . I dump Anthony Roderick into the man - sized trunk behind the two seats . And we lift off , heading over the Straights back to Florida , in a helicopter courtesy of Miami ’s best vagillionaires , our flight very courteously being ignored by local air traffic controllers . Guess it ’s true . Money can buy anything . Even justice , occasionally . The ride is n’t long , or high , and I climb in back to give Roderick some fresh air after we ’ve sufficiently scared the fuck out of him . He ’s pale as a ghost . Goes paler when I strap headphones onto his ears and let him know much dirt Derek ’s company dug up on him and sent over to the FBI . Funny , the things Derek Price can find . Usually he cleans up people ’s reputations . But being around people who need cleaning means he knows a thing or two about dirt . I like the guy . We land at the private Bluewater airstrip , and my nerves kick into high gear . My balls tell them to stand down , but it does n’t help . And no , I ’m not nervous about the fact that I just kidnapped a criminal from a country without an extradition treaty . Nor am I nervous about dropping the fucker with a guy Jude knows who does n’t ask any questions about where we found him , but who we can trust to make sure the asshole gets where he needs to be . Jude drives me back to where I need to be . He offers a fist bump before I get out . “
112075	112076	112077	112079	Ooh - rah	115	” “
112090	112094	112077	112079	Ooh - rah	115	” He grins . “
112108	112205	112097	112097	I	2293	” The liar follows me into the house — habit , probably . It ’s been ten days since Remy ’s attempted kidnapping . Ten days too long to do what I need to do right now . But we both need to see that Remy ’s still safe . And he is . Comfortably swinging and sleeping in the bright living room while Becca plays Angry Birds on her phone next to him . She jumps up when we enter , her gaze going to me , then up , up , up to Jude . “
112217	112218	112208	112208	You	2120	” “
112222	112226	112208	112208	You	2120	” Jude says . “
112230	112231	112208	112208	You	2120	” “
112238	112251	112208	112208	You	2120	” He nods , and without another word , turns and leaves . “
112254	112260	112208	112208	You	2120	” I say to Becca . “
112266	112281	112208	112208	You	2120	” She gnaws on her lower lip while I head over to kiss Remy . “
112289	112290	112283	112283	you	2120	” “
112293	112310	112311	112311	You	2120	” Yesterday . To plot out today after we got intel on where Roderick was hiding . “
112327	112328	112320	112320	you	2120	” “
112341	112365	112320	112320	you	2120	” I pull Remy out of his travel swing . He fusses and yawns , but he and I have somewhere to be . “
112373	112374	112375	112375	He	2120	” “
112390	112391	112387	112387	you	2120	” “
112394	112650	112387	112387	you	2120	” I thank her once more before I grab Remy ’s diaper bag and travel swing . This feels like goodbye . In a good way . I load Remy into my car , and we hit the road . Miami drivers are insane today , but I have precious cargo , so we take our time , which only makes my heart pump faster and the doubts and fears whisper louder . I distract myself by talking to Remy , who ’s strapped in tight . He coos in response , and fuck , I love that kid . He ’s a lot of work . But he smiles when I walk in the door . The way he pumps his legs when he ’s hungry — so fucking adorable . He ’s getting better at holding his head up . And rocking him to sleep every night puts me more at peace than I ’ve been in forever . Except for that little hole in my heart where Daisy still belongs . Once we get across the causeway , I turn the radio on to try to calm my nerves , but instead , the first thing I hear is two deejays talking about an anonymous donor who arranged catering for a full early Thanksgiving feast at all the Coast Guard stations around Miami . Dessert included . Of course . I reach the Bluewater gate , and the guard holds up a hand . My heart stops in time with my truck . “
112656	112660	112387	112387	you	2120	” he asks . “
112663	112687	112688	112688	Miss	2124	” I say slowly . He peeks in the back , and a grin as wide as the sea spreads over his face . “
112705	112927	112698	112698	You	2122	” He waves me through , and I head into Daisy ’s enclave . There are people playing tennis near the condo buildings . The Wealthy Widows are sipping something on the tropical miniature golf course ’s clubhouse patio . Frank the parrot flies by overhead , and I can only imagine what ’s coming out of his little beak . The shops in the village are busy but not crowded , with a few putting out early Christmas lights , and people wave as we drive by . It ’s so Daisy . Happy and a little wild , but also full of heart . We pull down her long , empty driveway , and I wonder if I ’ve gotten the wrong intel . If she ’s not actually home . I know she quit her job . I know Imogen Carter ’s on the verge of being overthrown at her own company by her board , and that Daisy ’s being begged to go back . Even temporarily to oversee a smooth transition . And I ’ve been led to believe that despite telling her yacht captain to take the boat to sea to make it look like she ’s left town , she ’s actually home . I ’ve barely parked before Alessandro steps out the door . “
112932	112944	112928	112928	You	2125	” he asks . I shake my head . He grins . “
112963	112972	112978	112979	my man	363	” Remy smiles and waves from his carrier . “
112981	112987	112978	112979	my man	363	” Alessandro boops his nose . “
113006	113095	112996	112997	Aunt Daisy	1115	” Well over a month ago , I walked this same path around Daisy ’s house to her pool . But I do n’t feel anything like that dude expecting to find out that my brother set me up for a party . I snort softly to myself . Feels like a lifetime ago . Voices carry down the path as I approach the pool , and one in particular stands out . Loud . Boisterous . Happy . Am I wrong ? Does she not need me ? “
113130	113181	112996	112997	Aunt Daisy	1115	” My heart starts pumping again . More than pumping . It ’s throbbing and glowing and telling my nuts to come out of hiding . Oak Park . I have n’t heard of an Oak Park neighborhood in Miami , but my parents live in Oak Park in Chicago . “
113198	113209	112996	112997	Aunt Daisy	1115	” another female voice says . Emily , I think . “
113222	113229	112996	112997	Aunt Daisy	1115	” Luna replies with a laugh . “
113246	113339	113238	113238	I	2293	” Cam asks . My heart stutters to a stop , and my eyes burn . She is . She ’s ordering pizza for my family . And all of Chicago . Expanding her random acts of kindness around the world . Remy coos loudly , and all the voices stop as we peek around the corner of the path and step out into the pool area . All four of Miami ’s strongest , smartest , hottest billionaires turn and look at us . Cam reacts first . She leaps up . “
113350	113354	113342	113342	I	2293	” Emily next . “
113361	113362	113342	113342	I	2293	” “
113367	113438	113439	113439	Tiana	380	” Luna pretends to be confused when Cameron and Emily grab her and head toward the souped - up , aerodynamic golf cart around the side of the pool house , but she winks at me before they load up and take off . Daisy ’s staring at me like she ca n’t decide if she wants to throw her phone at me , or hang up and jump me . “
113441	113451	113439	113439	Tiana	380	” Her assistant darts out of the pool house . “
113474	113579	113580	113580	I	2293	” Daisy ’s eyes are blue today . And her hair ’s brown . And she ’s wearing a sparkly top that reminds me of my nieces ’ favorite pillows , with the sequins that flip one way to reveal a different picture or a sassy saying , and I wonder what Daisy ’s shirt would say if I flipped her sequins . Undoubtedly something very Daisy . Fuck , I ’ve missed her . Her eyes dart from mine to Remy ’s carrier , going shiny as she sits there , just staring from her lounge chair at the edge of the pool . “
113582	113592	113580	113580	I	2293	” I start . She leaps to her feet . “
113608	113609	113602	113602	he	2293	” “
113612	113653	113654	113654	I	2293	” Her eyes snap to mine , and all the laughter and smiles of a minute ago have faded behind fear . Regret . Shame . I take two steps , but she holds out a hand to stop me . “
113660	113661	113662	113662	I	2293	” “
113668	113669	113670	113670	I	2293	” “
113675	113685	113686	113686	Remy	1365	” she whispers . My heart stops . Again . “
113690	113695	113686	113686	Remy	1365	” I tell her . “
113723	113729	113715	113715	he	94	” Her eyes go shiny . “
113733	113734	113715	113715	he	94	” “
113748	113784	113737	113737	I	2293	” I add . Awkwardly . Naturally , because here we are , building up to our next first date . I hope . Her lips wobble like she ’s torn between laughing and crying . “
113800	113810	113795	113795	I	2293	” she sucks in a big breath and looks away “
113816	113817	113818	113818	Daisy	1365	” “
113836	113837	113830	113830	You	2293	” “
113843	113847	113838	113838	I	2293	” she blurts . “
113862	113863	113864	113864	Daisy	1365	” “
113866	113867	113868	113868	I	2293	” “
114108	114109	114110	114110	I	2293	” “
114114	114146	114110	114110	I	2293	” Three of the most inadequate words I ’ve ever said in my life . But her face crinkles , half - smile , half - tears , and she whispers , “
114204	114220	114191	114191	I	2293	” I set Remy ’s carrier on the ground and close the space between us . “
114280	114281	114285	114285	you	2293	” “
114287	114303	114285	114285	you	2293	” She looks down , pink staining her cheeks . I tilt her chin up . “
114331	114340	114342	114342	you	2293	” Her smile ’s starting to peek through . “
114357	114358	114360	114360	you	2293	” “
114362	114363	114360	114360	you	2293	” “
114424	114425	114426	114426	Daisy	1365	” “
114428	114429	114426	114426	Daisy	1365	” “
114432	114433	114426	114426	Daisy	1365	” “
114439	114440	114426	114426	Daisy	1365	” “
114443	114462	114426	114426	Daisy	1365	” She blinks rapidly , and her chin wobbles . I brush an errant tear from her cheek . “
114473	114474	114469	114471	that mechanical unicorn	2147	” “
114477	114483	114469	114471	that mechanical unicorn	2147	” I pretend to wince . “
114493	114532	114487	114487	I	2293	” She shrieks and leaps at me , and I catch her , twirling as she attacks me with kisses to my chin , my jaw , my cheeks , and my nose while she chews me out . “
114553	114623	114551	114551	man	1362	” She ’s what I ’ve been missing in life . The fun . But also her pure heart . I squeeze her back as hard as I can without popping her lungs . She ’s so fucking right in my arms , and I ’ve missed her more than I ever thought I could miss anything in my life . Holding her again is like holding the sun . “
114630	114648	114551	114551	man	1362	” I breathe into her hair . She laughs , but it ’s a half - sob . “
114678	114679	114683	114683	Daisy	1365	” “
114688	114689	114690	114690	Remy	1365	” “
114692	114712	114717	114717	he	2229	” she suddenly shrieks . I set her on the ground , and she dives for the baby carrier . “
114754	114861	114866	114866	he	2229	” She has him out of his carrier and pressed to her shoulder , squeezing , her cheek on his hair while he gives me a look that clearly says now you ’ve done it , and I ’m never going to have a moment ’s peace again . I smile at the little guy . He ’s changing so much every day , getting more and more aware of the world , and I ’m only mildly terrified of the mischief I can already see brewing deep inside him . The next eighteen years are going to be a special , perfect kind of fun . “
114871	114895	114866	114866	he	2229	” She sniffs him , strokes his silky hair , lifts him and holds his gaze while her eyes start to leak again . “
114905	114906	114907	114907	He	2229	” “
114911	114923	114907	114907	He	2229	” I assure her as he squeals and kicks his legs . “
114929	114930	114931	114931	He	2229	” “
114935	114936	114937	114937	He	2229	” “
114944	114945	114937	114937	He	2229	” “
114951	114972	114937	114937	He	2229	” I slip my arms around both of them , and she leans into me , cradling Remy close again . “
114983	114984	114985	114985	I	2293	” “
114989	114990	114985	114985	I	2293	” “
114993	115038	114985	114985	I	2293	” It ’s a whispered plea that makes my heart both swell and ache . She should know how much she deserves to be loved forever , and I ’m going to spend every last minute of my life making sure she knows it . “
115041	115046	114985	114985	I	2293	” I agree huskily . “
115053	115054	114985	114985	I	2293	” “
115060	115093	114985	114985	I	2293	” She laughs , finally , that gloriously happy sound that gives my heart wings , and she lifts her eyes to mine . Sparkling , twinkling blue seas shine at me . “
115107	115111	114985	114985	I	2293	” I shrug . “
115124	115186	114985	114985	I	2293	” My own smile is making my cheeks hurt . This is n’t the family I pictured for myself . Or the kind of settling down I thought I ’d do . But Daisy and Remy — and whatever comes next — are everything I ever wanted , and so much more . She sucks in a sudden breath and straightens . “
115194	115213	115189	115189	I	2293	” she whispers . I lift a brow and smile , though her own face is pinching again . “
115222	115223	115224	115224	I	2293	” “
115231	115265	115227	115227	Nina	222	” My lips part . All the air leaves me . Is it possible to be so incredibly happy with the woman I have , while still missing a part of my past ? “
115272	115277	115268	115268	Baxter	221	” she rushes on . “
115310	115316	115317	115317	They	2151	” Fuck . Just fuck . “
115320	115362	115363	115363	I	2293	” My voice cracks , and I do n’t care . This . Here . My Daisy . Our son . By choice . And the family I thought I lost . She nods , and her smile goes watery again . “
115402	115403	115404	115404	I	2293	” “
115409	115414	115404	115404	I	2293	” I tell her . “
115423	115424	115421	115421	you	2293	” “
115432	115436	115421	115421	you	2293	” she says . “
115444	115472	115421	115421	you	2293	” She goes up on tiptoe to claim my lips , and I realize I have one more thing left that I have n’t given her yet . “
115480	115481	115482	115482	I	2293	” “
115489	115490	115482	115482	I	2293	” “
115500	115510	115511	115511	You	2293	” A spark of intrigue lights her blue eyes . “
115519	115758	115515	115515	You	2293	” I nod toward the pool house . She kisses me again . And I know we ’re going to have the wildest , most unexpected , biggest - hearted , best next forever in the history of forevers . Epilogue Daisy When West asked me where I wanted to get married , I suggested at the bottom of the ball pit . The crazy man agreed that squeezing all of our friends and family into the balls was a brilliant idea , and I realized I actually had finally fully met my match . I blinked first , which amused the hell out of him . I did n’t know the man could laugh that hard , but he did , and it was so hot that every pair of my panties burned up in the resulting lust fire . Or so I told him . Also , I like going commando . And he likes it too . I have this strange suspicion that Remy wo n’t be an only child for long . I ’m daydreaming about our honeymoon as I prop an elbow on the bar at Mordecai ’s , where our party has taken up almost the entire bistro for Drag Queen Brunch the day after Christmas , waiting for a bartender so I can ask for a special drink just for my surprise groom , when someone bumps into me from behind . “
115764	115827	115515	115515	You	2293	” she says . I look behind me , about to tell her it ’s not a problem , when I realize it ’s the unicorn author . I know celebrities . And rock stars . And sports stars . And politicians . I can talk to any of them . But I ’m suddenly completely starstruck as I meet her gaze . “
115833	115843	115515	115515	You	2293	” she says , gesturing to her overflowing purse . “
115885	115886	115887	115887	You	2157	” “
115891	115896	115887	115887	You	2157	” I tell her . “
115912	115913	115910	115910	you	2157	” “
115952	115953	115954	115954	He	962	” “
115957	115972	115954	115954	He	962	” I agree . I reach into my purse and pull out a card . “
115986	115997	115978	115978	We	2160	” She bites her lip , then grins and nods . “
116000	116380	115978	115978	We	2160	” Excitement bubbles over in my veins even as I realize West is going to kill me . And then I ’ll apologize and do a striptease and seduce him until he ca n’t remember what I did this time , and I ’ll make sure I ’m the first one up with Remy the next morning , and he ’ll forgive me . Actually , he ’ll forgive me even if I do n’t do all that . Turns out , he likes having fun . It ’s been missing from his life for too long , with all the military time and being the oldest for so long before that . But the man is lucky enough to be stuck with me forever . Almost , anyway . I order him a strawberry daiquiri , tell the bartender to put everyone ’s drinks on my tab today , and head back to my usual table with my besties . It ’s much tighter with Derek , Jude , Beck , and West squeezed in with us , but I like squeezes . And Remy loves being passed from aunt to uncle and all around . West ’s parents , sisters , their families , and even Tyler are here with us this morning , though at the closest tables instead of on top of us . So is my mom . Alessandro and Tiana , naturally . Baxter and Nina , who we call West ’s first kids , and who are both really fucking amazing young adults . And my grandmother , who ’s decided to retire and take up groveling for a hobby . It seems she ’s finally realized that her funeral would look a lot like Julienne ’s if she did n’t start showing her human side . Plus , I have this suspicion that West might ’ve gone to visit her during those ten years we were apart . I mean , ten days . But it felt like ten years . I have n’t asked . He has n’t offered . But my grandmother definitely has some respect for him that was n’t there before , and he ’s more tolerant of her when she ’s annoying than he was before . “
116399	116413	115978	115978	We	2160	” he asks me when the bartender arrives with his pink froufrou drink . “
116426	116434	115978	115978	We	2160	” I tell him with a grin . “
116446	116453	116437	116437	you	2161	” He laughs and kisses me . “
116466	116467	116457	116457	I	2293	” “
116477	116478	116479	116479	You	2161	” “
116484	116485	116479	116479	You	2161	” “
116495	116521	116490	116490	I	2293	” He chuckles again , and I nod to Lady Raquel , who stops in the middle of the dining room and claps her hands . “
116539	116645	116529	116529	We	2166	” she announces . My soon - to - be - sisters - in - law all go wide - eyed and squeal , turning their attention to West and me as we scoot out of the booth . He takes Remy back from Beck , who ’s just as natural with babies as he is with dogs . My mom dabs her eyes . West ’s mom does too . Other than the romance novelists and our families , the only other patrons here today are residents of Bluewater , which I ’m not sure they all realize , but it ’s utterly perfect . “
116666	116671	116672	116672	Daisy	1466	” Lady Raquel continues . “
116698	117049	117050	117050	I	2293	” I follow directions , stepping onto a chair , and then onto a table , West helping me and hopping up too while my security team gathers around us , just in case . We are standing on a table with a baby , after all . I ’ll let them get their boxer briefs in a bunch over me standing on a table . But just this once . Lady Raquel steps up onto a chair — those heels are seriously fabulous , and they put her at eye level with me , anyway — and begins the ceremony to officially make the three of us a real family in front of our friends , family , and favorite romance novelists . I might tear up a little , but when it ’s time for the vows , I look up into West ’s eyes , those magic color - changing eyes that are on the sea green side today , and I do n’t want to be at a party , or off on my yacht , or in Bora - Bora , or at a club . I want to be right here . With this amazing man who ’s helped me find inside of myself so much of the acceptance and belonging I was always looking for with the hundreds of acquaintances I ’ve made over the years . I still love a good dance party . And I adore people . And I ’ve gone back to Carter International Properties temporarily to make sure all of my former employees will be well taken care of by whoever replaces me . But I do n’t need to be popular to know I ’m loved . Or that I ’m worthy . And I ’m supposed to say my vows to this perfect man , but all I really want to do is kiss him . And so I do , because what ’s Lady Raquel going to do ? Refuse to continue the ceremony ? West is smiling as I pull out of the kiss . “
117054	117059	117050	117050	I	2293	” I tell him . “
117072	117213	117067	117067	I	2293	” Lady Raquel says while everyone around us claps and cheers . We say our I do ’s , kiss again , and everyone cheers . Except Remy . He poops his pants . As babies do . And Emily is n’t cheering , but she ’s dashing for the bathroom with her hand over her mouth like she ’s going to puke . Poor thing . Pregnancy is n’t agreeing with her all the time yet . Music pumps through the speakers , and the staff clears away a few tables for a dance floor . The grandmas fight over Remy , and as West pulls me into his arms for our first dance as woman and husband , he also holds up a manila envelope . I sway my hips into his and we rock to the music . “
117218	117219	117067	117067	I	2293	” “
