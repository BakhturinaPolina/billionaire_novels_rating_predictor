1492	1504	1505	1505	She	83	“ What in the devil do you think you ’re doing ? ”
1543	1546	1547	1547	I	83	“ Stop ! ”
1550	1553	1554	1554	she	83	“ Intruder ! ”
1561	1566	1567	1567	She	83	“ Marshmallow ! Attack ! ”
1593	1596	1567	1567	She	83	“ Stop . ”
1677	1682	1664	1664	she	83	“ Thief ! Murderer ! ”
1699	1709	1683	1683	I	83	“ Who the hell do you think you are ? ”
1710	1713	1714	1714	she	83	“ Help ! ”
1717	1720	1721	1721	I	83	“ Marshmallow ! ”
1810	1813	1814	1814	I	83	“ What , ”
1825	1833	1834	1834	She	83	“ are you doing in my house ? ”
1851	1858	1834	1834	She	83	“ This is n’t your house ! ”
1893	1903	1882	1882	I	83	“ It ’s sure as fuck not your house . ”
1917	1924	1915	1915	Mother	86	“ What are you doing here ? ”
1925	1928	1929	1929	she	83	“ Marshmallow ! ”
2054	2059	2045	2045	she	83	“ Who are you ? ”
2171	2186	2163	2163	she	83	“ I rented this house fair and square , and you need to leave . ”
2187	2202	2163	2163	she	83	“ I own this house , and I did n’t rent it to anyone . ”
2203	2207	2163	2163	she	83	“ Prove it . ”
2211	2223	2163	2163	she	83	“ You have no idea who I am , do you ? ”
2224	2230	2231	2231	she	83	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
2234	2240	2231	2231	she	83	“ Another one ? Marshmallow ! ”
2241	2250	2256	2256	I	83	“ Stop yelling marshmallow . What the hell — ”
2485	2511	2512	2512	I	83	“ Who are you ? And do n’t pull any of that arrogant you should know who I am because I ’m so important baloney , ”
2727	2740	2741	2741	His	404	“ My name is Hayes Rutherford , and this is my house . ”
3184	3207	3208	3208	He	411	“ Oh my god , Hayes Rutherford . Like the president , but backwards . Did your parents do that on purpose ? ”
3463	3466	3467	3468	Hayes Rutherford	2931	“ Yes , ”
3472	3487	3467	3468	Hayes Rutherford	2931	“ That ’s exactly it . My parents have a presidential sense of humor . ”
3488	3493	3494	3494	He	2931	“ You ’re lying . ”
3507	3515	3494	3494	He	2931	“ How did you get in here ? ”
3516	3536	3467	3468	Hayes Rutherford	2931	“ With the code . I rented this house for two weeks . How did you get in here ? ”
3537	3545	3494	3494	He	2931	“ Where did you rent this house ? ”
3562	3570	3560	3560	men	422	“ You did n’t answer my question . ”
3571	3591	3494	3494	He	2931	“ I ’ve answered your question six times . I own this house . Where did you rent it ? ”
3592	3639	3644	3644	his	423	“ Vacation rental site . And you answered that question twice , which does n’t make me believe it any more than I did the first time . How do you have a vacation rental house that you do n’t know is a vacation rental house ? ”
4059	4070	4071	4071	he	436	“ Will you please put that damned hair dryer down ? ”
4074	4085	4071	4071	he	436	“ And for god ’s sake , tie the robe . ”
4140	4144	4145	4145	He	436	“ Turn around . ”
4172	4209	4153	4153	I	83	“ How do I know you ’re the owner ? What if you just know the owner ? Or what if you ’re casing the joint to figure out when the house will be empty next ? ”
4210	4246	4280	4280	he	436	“ You ’ve found me out . I ’m a burglar . I ’m the tuxedo burglar , and I only burgle while wearing last night ’s formal wear . Whatever shall I take first ? ”
4247	4255	4153	4153	I	83	“ Sarcasm is not attractive on you . ”
4256	4275	4276	4276	I	83	“ I do n’t believe you ’re in any condition to make observations about anyone else ’s attractiveness . ”
4291	4300	4286	4286	He	436	“ Marshmallow , bite him in the balls . ”
4380	4407	4408	4408	My	83	“ Marshmallow , you know those do n’t fit my hips . If you want to help me dress , get something out of my suitcase . ”
4443	4455	4430	4430	Hayes	2931	“ I need to see a copy of this rental agreement . ”
4518	4584	4585	4585	His	441	“ It ’s in my email on my phone . And if you ’re not in the family pictures downstairs , I ’m calling the police . I ’m happy to work this out with you , but I need a show of good faith . You have to let me get dressed and cleaned up , and then I ’ll show you the agreement . ”
4670	4701	4658	4658	they	445	“ You have five minutes to get dressed and meet me downstairs with this rental agreement , or I ’ll be the one calling the police . Are we clear ? ”
4702	4706	4658	4658	they	445	“ Twenty minutes . ”
4707	4710	4658	4658	they	445	“ Five . ”
4711	4714	4658	4658	they	445	“ Fifteen . ”
4715	4718	4658	4658	they	445	“ Five . ”
4719	4722	4658	4658	they	445	“ Thirty . ”
4723	4726	4727	4727	He	2931	“ Three . ”
4813	4816	4817	4817	My	83	“ Marshmallow ! ”
4957	4962	4963	4963	she	453	“ Oh my god , ”
4969	4975	4963	4963	she	453	“ You ’re Hayes Rutherford . ”
5176	5180	5181	5181	I	83	“ Your name , ”
5202	5214	5197	5197	I	83	“ And get that nuisance out of my house . Now . ”
5215	5227	5197	5197	I	83	“ You ’re from those Rutherfords . The Razzle Dazzle Rutherfords . ”
5345	5350	5351	5351	I	83	“ Your . Name . ”
5354	5381	5351	5351	I	83	“ Begonia . I ’m Begonia . Oh my god . I had your brother ’s posters all over my wall when I was a teenager . ”
5402	5406	5395	5395	I	83	“ Begonia who ? ”
5407	5418	5419	5419	I	83	“ Oh , are we doing knock - knock jokes ? ”
5435	5442	5443	5443	She	348	“ What ’s your last name ? ”
5450	5459	5460	5460	I	83	“ Or I can go through your purse , ”
5492	5510	5511	5511	She	348	“ You ’re the first person to ask me that . Sorry . I need a minute . ”
5522	5537	5511	5511	She	348	“ Wow . Did n’t expect it to hit me like that . Sorry . ”
6050	6053	6054	6054	Begonia	348	“ Fairchild , ”
6057	6064	6054	6054	Begonia	348	“ My name is Begonia Fairchild . ”
6080	6091	6118	6118	she	348	“ And that ’s difficult to say , because … ? ”
6098	6106	6107	6107	She	348	“ I picked it after my divorce . ”
6137	6307	6130	6130	she	348	“ There was no way I could continue being a Dixon , and I never really felt like Bidelspach fit me the way I wanted it to , so I decided to be Begonia Fairchild . My dad would ’ve liked it . He was way more the peace , love , and prosper type than my mom ever was . Give me fifteen minutes to shower and put some clothes on , and I ’ll pull up that rental agreement for you and we ’ll figure out what ’s going on here . Did you want some cheesecake ? I got enough for a party and I figured it would last me all week , but I can go get more if we eat it all this morning . Oh my god . You ’re Jonas Rutherford ’s strange older brother . I ca n’t believe I ’m standing here in your house . And I did n’t mean strange in a bad way . That ’s just — ”
6308	6312	6130	6130	she	348	“ Stop talking . ”
6313	6340	6130	6130	she	348	“ — what the teen magazines always called you . I ’m sorry . That ’s a bad habit . I wo n’t say that again . ”
6341	6392	6393	6393	I	83	“ You ’ll shower , pack , sign a non - disclosure agreement stating that you were n’t here and you ’ve never seen me , and that you acknowledge I ’ll sue for ten million dollars in the event you break your word , and then you can leave . ”
6498	6505	6506	6506	Begonia	348	“ It ’s okay , Marshmallow , ”
6516	6580	6510	6510	She	348	“ I truly am sorry . That ’s rude of the tabloids to call you names , and I should know better than to repeat it . I ’m a little flustered . It ’s not every day that I — well , that I meet someone related to my teenage crush . But you probably hear that enough that it ’s annoying . ”
6645	6738	6739	6739	She	348	“ Right ! Shower , dressed , and I ’ll make you some coffee and cheesecake while I sign that non - disclosure agreement for you and we figure out who ’s staying and who ’s going where . My lips are zipped . I wo n’t breathe a word . I wo n’t even ask for a picture . Cross my heart . And I ’m sorry Marshmallow took your phone . He — well , he sometimes thinks he ’s someone ’s annoying little human brother instead of a dog . ”
6742	6778	6779	6779	I	83	“ Do you eat cheesecake ? I know there are cheesecake pop stands on every corner at the Razzle Dazzle parks , but I guess that does n’t mean you eat it , does it ? ”
6785	6792	6793	6793	She	348	“ Right . Upstairs . Right . ”
6803	6846	6793	6793	She	348	“ Why are you here dressed like you came from a party ? I ’ve been here for two nights already , and the host on the vacation rental site must know you well enough to have not expected you , so — ”
6847	6868	6869	6869	She	348	“ While you ’re showering , I ’ll note all damages to the house and prepare a bill for you . ”
6876	7027	6872	6872	I	83	“ You should know that the handheld spout in the owners ’ suite shower was already broken when I got here . I made a note to report it to the host when I have cell service again , and I hardly minded , because the rain shower spout is the coolest thing ever . Who needs the handheld spout when you can pretend you ’re showering in a rainstorm instead ? Also , Marshmallow is n’t the first dog to stay here . I know most owners are picky about dogs staying in vacation rental homes , so it was amazing that this one said pets were welcome . We were a little surprised by the dog hair caked in all the runners on the stairs , but it was n’t a big deal to us since we knew Marshmallow would be leaving some of his own . And — ”
7028	7033	7034	7034	Her	487	“ Stop . Talking . ”
7060	7063	7064	7064	I	83	“ March , ”
7067	7078	7079	7079	she	487	“ I knew it was too good to be true , ”
7117	7166	7167	7167	I	83	“ Who rents a house like this for fifty bucks a night ? It ’s like that time we signed up to go sailing with that Groupon and got there and the captain was drunk and forgot he booked three hundred people on a boat built for seven . ”
7187	7220	7173	7173	she	487	“ But that turned out okay , did n’t it , Marshmallow ? I really was n’t supposed to be on that boat that day . This will turn out okay too . ”
8334	8337	8338	8338	I	83	“ Yes ? ”
8341	8348	8338	8338	I	83	“ It ’s been seventeen minutes , ”
8353	8359	8360	8360	I	83	“ Ca n’t rush beauty , ”
8390	8398	8380	8380	I	83	“ Or presentability , in some cases . ”
8399	8417	8418	8418	I	83	“ You have two minutes before I shut off the water and toss you off the balcony . ”
8467	8471	8472	8472	I	83	“ Almost done , ”
8475	8506	8507	8507	He	108	“ Are you ready to see the new and improved Begonia Fairchild ? Got ta warn you , it ’ll be surprising after what I looked like when we met . ”
8647	8650	8651	8651	My	83	“ Marshmallow ! ”
8675	8681	8682	8682	I	83	“ Where are the towels ? ”
8702	8712	8713	8713	I	83	“ This is no time for hide and seek , ”
8735	8745	8746	8746	Hayes	2931	“ Dammit , dog , I put you outside , ”
8812	8818	8819	8819	I	83	“ He can open doors , ”
8822	8841	8819	8819	I	83	“ Do you mind waiting downstairs ? And possibly tossing in a couple towels on your way out ? ”
8845	8848	8849	8849	I	83	“ Hayes ? ”
8856	8862	8864	8864	he	108	“ Um , Mr. Rutherford ? ”
8894	8907	8908	8908	I	83	“ I ’m naked and walking to the closet for a towel , ”
8968	8972	8951	8951	I	83	“ Good god , ”
9135	9157	9158	9158	I	83	“ Could you please , for the love of all that has ever been holy , put on some goddamn clothes ? ”
9290	9371	9286	9286	my	83	“ Relax , Mr. Rutherford . One , you ’ve basically already seen it all . Two , I tried to warn you . And three , it ’s not like your mother ’s catching us in a compromising position . I ’m positive this is n’t the worst thing to ever happen to you . It ’s pretty high up there for me though , so if you do n’t mind waiting downstairs for just a couple more minutes — ”
9372	9382	9383	9383	He	325	“ Will you be wearing your own damn clothes ? ”
9461	9489	9452	9452	he	325	“ So long as Marshmallow did n’t distribute them all over the house , yes , I ’ll be drying off and putting on my own clothes . ”
9490	9499	9538	9538	He	325	“ Your dog needs to go back outside . ”
9500	9537	9538	9538	He	325	“ He gets lonely if he ’s outside alone for too long . Also , since he can open doors , if you did n’t lock them all , he ’ll find a way back in . ”
10119	10182	10113	10113	I	83	“ He was raised from birth to be a service dog , but he flunked out of the program when he started doing all the things he ’d learned because he wanted to , instead of only on command . I have things Marshmallow - proofed at home . We have a good system . He ’s out of his element here . ”
10183	10190	10191	10191	I	83	“ Your dog called my mother . ”
10409	10427	10428	10428	she	83	“ Well , I hope Marshmallow was polite and did n’t bark your mother ’s ear off , ”
10491	10501	10483	10483	I	83	“ Good boy , helping Mommy with the dishes . ”
10502	10509	10510	10510	I	83	“ The contract , Ms. Fairchild . ”
10589	10621	10622	10622	She	348	“ Of course . Sorry . Nervous habit . Not that I like cleaning , but I — never mind . The contract . It ’s right here in my email … ”
10651	10657	10645	10645	She	348	“ Is there a problem ? ”
10658	10704	10705	10705	I	83	“ No , no . It ’s just thinking . I like your pajama pants . One of my students found that old video of the dancing hamsters late last year , so we did a unit on the art of the early internet memes . ”
10716	10737	10710	10710	She	348	“ The dancing hamsters on your pants . I assume you ’re a fan ? Or were those a gift ? ”
10738	10748	10645	10645	She	348	“ Hamsters have nothing to do with your contract . ”
10749	10828	10645	10645	She	348	“ I have the contract . I do . But my email program seems to have had a little glitch and emptied all the emails that were in my inbox , and I do n’t get service here , and there ’s no wifi , and … and that was supposed to be exactly what I wanted , but it ’s a little inconvenient right now that I need to download my inbox again and I … can’t . ”
10829	10832	10833	10833	I	83	“ Inconvenient , ”
10844	11095	10836	10836	She	348	“ I paid for this house ! And Mr. Ferguson sent me instructions on how to get to the island and which golf cart company to use to get to the gate with my luggage , and to play a game where I said I was Marilyn Monroe , which makes so much more sense now , for the record , and he sent the code , and I would n’t know any of that if I was n’t authorized somehow to be here , even by someone who should n’t have authorized me . I ’m not a thief . I ’m not a trespasser . Do you believe in fate , Hayes ? Because I saw this house come up on the vacation rental site — one minute it was n’t there , and I got lost in my search and started it over , and then poof , here was this house , and it was fate ’s way of saying I ’m sorry you married the wrong person and took too many years to realize it , here , go enjoy coastal Maine for a couple weeks , and gah , that sounds like I ’m trying to sob - story you into letting me stay , but I ’m not . I ’m just telling you what happened , and you do n’t need to feel sorry for me . I just want you to know I honestly thought I was supposed to be here . ”
11147	11153	11154	11154	She	583	“ Give me your phone . ”
11164	11179	11154	11154	She	583	“ Are you going to make my dog eat it like he did yours ? ”
11194	11202	11154	11154	She	583	“ Yes . That will solve everything . ”
11210	11218	11203	11203	Her	583	“ I ’m trying very hard here . ”
11219	11277	11301	11301	She	583	“ And I have a headache , I have n’t slept in two days , and I wanted peace and quiet and to be alone , and this is my house . Give me your damn phone so I can find this damn contract you claim to have so that I know who I have to murder . ”
11278	11288	11301	11301	She	583	“ I do n’t have signal , and I — ”
11289	11300	11301	11301	She	583	“ Give . Me . Your . Damn . Phone . ”
11403	11422	11396	11396	she	583	“ Does your family know you say damn ? That ’s not allowed in any of your movies . ”
11423	11427	11428	11428	I	83	“ Unlock it , ”
11451	11486	11432	11432	She	583	“ If I find out you ’re Hayes Rutherford ’s doppelgänger and that you are really the one who ’s not supposed to be here , I ’ll do something we ’ll both regret . ”
11487	11507	11513	11513	she	583	“ Believe me , Ms. Fairchild , if I could be anyone else right now , I would be . ”
11521	11560	11513	11513	she	583	“ Why would you want to be anyone else ? You ’re financially set , you have a good reputation , your family is lovely , and there ’s literally nothing in the world you ca n’t have . ”
11566	11635	11636	11636	I	83	“ Yes , yes , except this house to yourself at this exact moment . And no family is ever as perfect as they look on TV . I ’m aware . You ’re inconvenienced and imperfect . So am I , Hayes . So am I. But I ’m rolling with it , and I think you ’d be happier if you tried to do the same . ”
11689	11698	11699	11699	I	83	“ How many people did you have over ? ”
11706	11712	11713	11713	I	83	“ Just me and Marshmallow . ”
11724	11729	11730	11730	She	583	“ Oh , that . ”
11738	11872	11873	11873	She	583	“ It ’s been such a long time since I decided where we should eat that I do n’t actually know my favorite foods anymore . I ’m sampling them all . Do you know I ’d never had curry before yesterday ? There ’s a soup and sandwich shop over in town with a curried chicken salad and it was so good . I ’m thinking of offering to do some bussing in exchange for tips and tricks on how to make my chicken salad that good when I go home . I ’d never ask for their actual recipe , but if they wanted to share the brand of curry powder they use , or any you should know to never combine these ingredients suggestions , that ’s all I need . ”
11945	11951	11952	11952	I	83	“ You need psychological help , ”
11956	12036	11952	11952	I	83	“ My therapist said I probably only need to check in every three to six months . She was massively helpful during the divorce . And I still have daily work to do on myself , but I ’m up for the hard work , and that ’s the important part . Well , that and all the hard work I ’ve already done . Scoot over , please , and I ’ll get these bread crumbs behind you . ”
12087	12108	12079	12079	her	583	“ Could you please make that dog go live outside until I ’ve removed you from this house as well ? ”
12123	12140	12109	12109	She	583	“ Marshmallow ! Go catch a butterfly ! Go catch a butterfly , you good boy ! ”
12204	12210	12193	12193	She	583	“ Coffee while we wait ? ”
12211	12214	12244	12244	she	583	“ No . ”
12215	12243	12244	12244	she	583	“ No , thank you , Begonia , but it ’s a very kind offer to share your special coffee of the month club coffee with me , ”
12277	12367	12270	12270	Begonia	348	“ Does your family drink the same coffee that ’s served at your theme parks , or do you have , like , a private coffee plantation where you grow and harvest your own ? With — what is it ? Civets , right ? Civets eat the raw coffee beans , then digest them , and when they ’re harvested on the other end , they ’re super fancy and delicious in a way you would n’t think considering what the beans have , erm , been through . ”
12368	12386	12387	12387	She	348	“ I do n’t drink coffee . I drink the blood of people who piss me off . ”
12390	12494	12495	12496	This woman	83	“ Oh , wow , do you have any idea how many of my students quoted that line to me last fall ? I did n’t see Trick or Date — my ex really did n’t like Razzle Dazzle films — but my kids adored it . They even said Jonas was hot for an old guy . Teenagers , right ? Thirty - something is not old , but maybe he should start playing roles more mature than college kids ? I mean , it was great that your family finally moved him up from playing the high - schooler , but — ”
12512	12530	12505	12505	she	83	“ I ’m printing the non - disclosure agreement , and then you can leave . Immediately . ”
12831	12840	12841	12841	Begonia	348	“ Does your eye always twitch like that ? ”
12874	12907	12844	12844	She	2159	“ You seem like you ’re under an unhealthy level of stress . Way more than I ’d expect for you finding an unexpected guest in your house . Is everything okay ? ”
12961	12964	12965	12965	He	618	“ Marshmallow ! ”
12998	13003	13004	13004	Begonia	348	“ What the fuck ? ”
13040	13049	13050	13050	she	348	“ Just needs a little polish and freshening , ”
13054	13060	13061	13061	She	348	“ Maurice Bellitano carved that . ”
13065	13070	13061	13061	She	348	“ The Maurice Bellitano ? ”
13071	13092	13050	13050	she	348	“ That ’s my grandfather . Your dog chewed off the head of Maurice Bellitano ’s carving of my grandfather . ”
13093	13098	13099	13099	she	348	“ Oh , god , ”
13212	13219	13191	13191	she	348	“ Oh , no no no … ”
13350	13357	13358	13358	I	83	“ Do . Not . Move , ”
13361	13378	13379	13379	She	348	“ Do not think . Do not breathe . Do not move . Do you understand ? ”
13413	13436	13379	13379	She	348	“ My brain and my instincts are very much at odds over understanding right now , if I ’m being perfectly honest . ”
13437	13449	13450	13450	I	83	“ And for the love of god , do not talk . ”
13584	13595	13571	13571	he	2931	“ Congratulations , Begonia . You ’re now my girlfriend . ”
13640	13647	13648	13648	He	2931	“ I ’m sorry , what ? ”
13717	13732	13710	13710	I	83	“ Was that from Maurice ’s early years ? It has some inconsistencies from — ”
13733	13760	13710	13710	I	83	“ It ’s a Bellitano original , and yes , I can prove it . Even if I could n’t , who would the courts believe ? ”
13761	13817	13818	13819	Hayes Rutherford	2931	“ Do you know that you have a choice every day to not be the kind of guy who thinks everything is a personal insult ? It ’s okay to let things go . Research says it actually makes us happier to assume everyone around us has good intentions and sometimes screw - ups happen . ”
13865	13925	13932	13932	him	2931	“ I can bill you for the damages to that statue , among the rest of the damages you ’ve caused to this house and the grounds , or we can come to an alternate arrangement whereby you present yourself to my mother and the world as my girlfriend , and I do n’t financially ruin you for life . ”
13948	13957	13939	13939	me	83	“ You live in a very strange world . ”
13958	13981	14071	14071	He	2931	“ Two weeks , you said you paid for ? That ’s plenty of time for us to get engaged as well . ”
13982	13986	13939	13939	me	83	“ Excuse you ? ”
13987	14070	14071	14071	He	2931	“ We wo n’t get married . The very idea of it is beyond comprehension , and the legalities would be a larger headache than it would be worth . But I have no desire to be inundated with family trying to save me from my bachelorhood now that the entire world is watching me , and you have very few options for enjoying the rest of your vacation , much less your entire life , if you do n’t sign here . ”
14142	14147	14132	14132	Hayes	2931	“ What is this ? ”
14193	14392	14461	14461	His	630	“ Oh my god , is this a set - up ? Did Hyacinth win some kind of win a date with your favorite celebrity game , and give the prize to me instead , and then Jonas could n’t make it ? You knew I was here . Is Jonas coming ? Oh my god . I have n’t watched his movies in at least eight years . They all got to be the same after a while , you know ? Do n’t tell him I said that . And then Chad did n’t like anything with actors who were more handsome than he was , because Chad was a douchewaffle , and I can call him that because my therapist says I should n’t feel bad for not liking people on occasion , and people I ’m willing to divorce fall under the umbrella of people I ’m allowed to not like . I have n’t even watched the reruns of Hollybrook and Mistletoe that used to run each December . Do you still play that every year ? Has it aged okay ? I ca n’t remember all the specifics now , but I — ”
14393	14460	14461	14461	His	630	“ This is not a set - up , and you will not be meeting my brother . You ’ll be staying here , playing the part of my girlfriend , and distracting my mother and the rest of my family when they try to introduce me to women , and I ’ll be either working in the study or disappearing to New York for meetings . ”
14480	14486	14466	14466	his	630	“ If I absolutely must . ”
14534	14544	14532	14532	Begonia	83	“ You have lost your ever - loving mind . ”
14545	14691	14532	14532	Begonia	83	“ Quite the contrary . It ’s the most efficient plan . I have no desire to have my family parade me around like the last eligible duke in some nineteenth - century historical novel , and the only thing that will stop them is a belief that I ’m already involved with someone , and the further belief that if they do n’t back off , I will finally snap and marry someone so completely wrong for the role of my wife . You ’re here . I do n’t have to go search in town for anyone else , and you ’re clearly unsuitable . You ’ve passed an initial background check , you have nowhere to be until school begins again in late August , and I demand compensation for both damages and the inconvenience of not being fucking asleep right now . ”
14692	14701	14532	14532	Begonia	83	“ You ran a background check on me ? ”
14702	14799	14800	14800	I	83	“ Begonia Florence Fairchild , nee Bidelspach , formerly Dixon , employed by Tobin High School as an art teacher , three speeding tickets in the past year , your Netflix account is suspended because your credit card payment failed , daughter of Helen Nolan and Daniel Bidelspach , who divorced when you were seven . Father passed when you were seventeen . And if you spill the details of anything inside the agreement to your twin sister , Hyacinth , all will be null and void , and you ’ll owe me ten million dollars . ”
14814	14854	14808	14808	I	83	“ A more thorough background check is still ongoing , so if there ’s anything I need to know before I tell my mother I ’m madly in love with you , you ’d best speak up right now . ”
14855	14866	14867	14867	He	633	“ In love ? This is a set - up . ”
14870	14898	14867	14867	He	633	“ If this were a set - up , I would not have certain images in my head that make me finally understand the term brain bleach . ”
14924	14938	14919	14919	he	633	“ Now I see why Jonas is known as the charming Rutherford brother . ”
14939	14998	14905	14905	He	633	“ It ’s a fake relationship , Ms. Fairchild . I have no reason to charm you , whereas you have every reason to convince my mother that we ’re madly in love . You may take this very generous offer , or you may see me in court . I ’ll give you fifteen minutes to decide . ”
14999	15036	15073	15073	I	83	“ How do I know you ’re not a serial killer with enough money and family connections to cover up all your crimes and this is n’t just the way you play with your victims first ? ”
15037	15072	15073	15073	I	83	“ I suppose you do n’t . Fourteen minutes and fifty - two seconds , Ms. Fairchild . I ’m tired , and I expect my mother soon . You ’d best get reading . ”
15085	15102	15103	15103	He	634	“ Why do n’t you just tell your mother you do n’t want to date anyone ? ”
15128	15131	15111	15111	he	634	“ YMCA . ”
15181	15197	15198	15198	Hayes	2931	“ It ’s almost adorable how little you know about the upper class , darling , ”
15204	15284	15198	15198	Hayes	2931	“ Darling ? We need to work on terms of endearment . You . You need to work on terms of endearment . Also , you need to think this through a little more . Assuming I accept your argument that you , as a grown man , are incapable of just telling your mother you do n’t want to date anyone , what in the world makes you think she ’ll just accept that you ’re dating me ? ”
15285	15442	15443	15443	I	83	“ If she does n’t , I ’ll promise to go to the press with all the details about how we started dating before your divorce was finalized . And lest you think I ’m incapable myself of convincing my mother that I ’m in love , bear in mind that I ’ve been forced to watch Razzle Dazzle films from the cradle . I may not enjoy acting , and I may not understand the appeal of the god - awful films coming out of my family ’s company , but that does n’t mean I do n’t know how it ’s done , and if there ’s one thing I do very well , Ms. Fairchild , it ’s whatever I set my mind to . And I ’m determined to convince the world that I ’m very much in love with you . It ’s the most efficient way to restore my peace . ”
15707	15726	15694	15694	he	325	“ There are n’t any details about us dating before I was divorced , because we just met . ”
15727	15744	15756	15756	he	325	“ Once again , darling , you are so naïve in the ways of the world . ”
15780	15806	15807	15807	I	83	“ Just how terrifying is your mother , boo - berry ? She always seems so nice on talk shows and during red carpet interviews . ”
15815	15859	15807	15807	I	83	“ My mother is a menace . She wants me married . I ’m uninterested . So you ’ll run interference , I ’ll have peace and quiet , and I wo n’t tell her what happened to the statue of my grandfather . ”
15860	15868	15756	15756	he	325	“ Why does she want you married ? ”
15895	15904	15807	15807	I	83	“ Do you read the news , Begonia ? ”
15905	15991	15992	15992	He	654	“ Been a little busy getting divorced here , Hayes . Also , I gave up celebrity gossip around the time Violet Quinn checked into rehab and every channel had a live newsfeed of the clinic she was supposedly staying at . It felt like such a violation of her privacy when she was in such a low place , not to mention everyone else who could ’ve been exposed on national TV for being near the place , and it made my stomach hurt . ”
16017	16054	15807	15807	I	83	“ Eleven minutes , Ms. Fairchild . If you intend to reject my settlement offer , I suggest using your eleven minutes to gather what you can of your belongings before I forcibly throw you out . ”
16055	16220	16221	16221	Marshmallow	84	“ I ca n’t really be the best partner in crime if I do n’t know why we ’re committing the heist . Why does your mother want you married ? Is it like , normal mother stuff , with her insisting you ’ve waited long enough to give her grandbabies ? Does she still do your laundry and she ’s tired of it and wants another woman to take over raising you instead ? Oh my god . If you tell me you ’re gay and your family wo n’t accept that , I ’m sorry , I wo n’t be your fake girlfriend , but I will one thousand percent be the person who gets arrested for telling every last one of them off . Is that it ? Are you in love with a man ? Oh my god . Razzle Dazzle has never done a film with main characters who are n’t straight , have they ? Oh my god . ”
16256	16366	16367	16367	My	83	“ My mother knows better than to insist I raise a child merely to satisfy her urges to hold a baby . I ’m well aware of how to send my laundry out for cleaning without needing any assistance , along with conducting every other chore and task necessary to be a fully - functioning adult . And I am not in love with a man , but you ’re still welcome to give my mother an earful about the homogeny of Razzle Dazzle ’s films . Congratulations , Ms. Fairchild . You ’ve just convinced me more than ever that you ’re the right woman for the job . ”
16391	16399	16526	16526	she	348	“ Did you just call me attractive ? ”
16400	16492	16494	16496	Hayes Begonia Fairchild	348	“ Dear god , no . Rather annoying , actually . Which is perfect . My mother will have her hands so full trying to get rid of you that she ’ll leave me alone completely . Add in her fear that I ’ll find someone even worse after you if she does n’t back off , and this is perfect . The document , Ms. Fairchild . Last chance . Are we doing this the easy way , or shall I get my attorney and the sheriff on the phone ? ”
16684	16711	16712	16712	Begonia	348	“ So if we ’ve been talking on the internet for the past six months , that means we ’ll know a lot about each other , ”
16723	16754	16755	16755	She	348	“ Moby Dick ? Really ? Do you read it , or is it a conversation piece ? There ’s nothing wrong with reading commercial fiction instead of literary classics . ”
16769	16784	16763	16763	I	83	“ The only story we need is that you find cranky assholes irresistibly charming . ”
16785	16805	16715	16715	she	348	“ That ’s the plot of half the Razzle Dazzle films . No one ’s going to believe it . ”
16806	16858	16859	16859	She	348	“ Quite frankly , Ms. Fairchild , I do n’t need my mother to believe us . I merely need her to know I ’ll make the family look bad in the press if she insists on presenting me with a parade of eligible women she ’d like me to marry . ”
16863	16935	16859	16859	She	348	“ I don’t — oh . Oh . It ’s not about telling your mom no , is it ? It ’s about the time and energy it takes every time she throws another woman at you . Or is it about disappointing your mother ? Do you have mommy issues ? I never thought I did until I announced I was divorcing Chad , and now I ’m the disappointment . ”
16936	16959	16763	16763	I	83	“ Congratulations , Ms. Fairchild , you have confirmed that you do , in fact , listen three percent of the time . ”
16960	16996	16997	16997	She	2503	“ My listening skills are fine . It ’s your communication skills that need work . You had two options there , and you just said I listened . That ’s not answering the question . ”
17076	17101	17115	17115	she	2503	“ One more thing you ’ll be certain to tell my mother you find charming about me . Where the devil did you hide — ”
17147	17152	17153	17153	Begonia	348	“ Oh , visitors ! ”
17167	17204	17153	17153	Begonia	348	“ Do n’t worry , I ’ll send them away . Unless they brought food . I definitely need to get over to town to get some food , since Marshmallow ruined everything in the fridge . ”
17205	17211	17212	17212	I	83	“ Do n’t tell them — ”
17250	17253	17246	17246	I	83	“ Hello ? ”
17254	17283	17284	17284	My	83	“ Hello , this is Mayor Kristine Turner . We heard the owner ’s back in residence . Just wanted to check and see if he needs anything ? ”
17292	17297	17298	17298	I	83	“ Tell her no , ”
17311	17320	17298	17298	I	83	“ Oh , no , we ’re good , ”
17324	17342	17321	17321	Begonia	348	“ I ’ll be coming into town in a little bit for supplies , but for now — ”
17343	17349	17350	17351	the mayor	666	“ I can bring supplies , ”
17354	17395	17350	17351	the mayor	666	“ Does Hayes need food ? What about his favorite wine ? My mom ’s happy to make him her famous sponge cake . We know how much he loves that . Is he still allergic to strawberries and dogs ? ”
17422	17430	17321	17321	Begonia	348	“ I said , tell her no . ”
17431	17452	17321	17321	Begonia	348	“ Hayes . That ’s rude . Do n’t hang up on people . How do I call her back ? ”
17453	17469	17321	17321	Begonia	348	“ You do n’t . No one in town needs to know I ’m here . ”
17470	17514	17321	17321	Begonia	348	“ They already know you ’re here . Also , you ’re allergic to dogs ? How does she know you’re … oh my god . Did she pretend to be your girlfriend another time when you were hiding from your mother here ? ”
17546	17559	17560	17560	She	348	“ Do . Not . Pick . Up . The . Intercom . ”
17592	17595	17580	17580	her	348	“ Why ? ”
17639	17645	17621	17621	she	348	“ Because I said so . ”
17646	17668	17669	17669	She	348	“ Someone who knows you love her mother ’s sponge cake is clearly a friend , so what ’s the big — ”
17697	17711	17669	17669	She	348	“ You dated her , did n’t you ? You seriously dated her . ”
17712	17729	17730	17730	She	348	“ Do not confirm for anyone that I ’m here . Have I made myself clear ? ”
17813	17901	17804	17804	She	348	“ There are fresh sheets in the laundry room . I ’ll go fix up the bed . Do you know when your mother ’s getting here ? I ’m great with parents , so if you wanted to go to sleep , you ’re welcome to , and you can trust me to charm the pants off your mother . Which guest room does she like ? I ’ll get that fixed up too , and take the one in the basement for me and Marshmallow . ”
17902	17918	17804	17804	She	348	“ Your dog can sleep in the basement . You ’ll be in my room . ”
17919	17922	17804	17804	She	348	“ I — ”
17923	17940	17941	17941	She	669	“ For the farce to work , Ms. Fairchild , you ’ll be in my room . ”
17970	17988	17941	17941	She	669	“ Can I at least tell the mayor I ’ll let her know if I need anything ? ”
17989	17992	17956	17956	she	669	“ No . ”
17993	17999	18000	18000	I	83	“ You ’re incredibly unreasonable . ”
18023	18032	18033	18033	She	669	“ It ’s a perk of being me . ”
18196	18213	18183	18183	we	673	“ I hope you ’re half as good with parents as you are at annoying me , ”
18228	18235	18183	18183	we	673	“ Mother . What a surprise , ”
18675	18700	18701	18701	Giovanna	135	“ See to it that my luggage is taken to the guest quarters upstairs and make Amelia comfortable in the room down the hall , ”
18705	18716	18701	18701	Giovanna	135	“ Charlotte will take the en suite in the basement . ”
18717	18725	18726	18726	Hayes	2931	“ Carry your own luggage , Mother , ”
18729	18738	18726	18726	Hayes	2931	“ Begonia is n’t here to serve you . ”
18739	18753	18754	18754	She	135	“ Ah , my sweet boy . So cranky when you ’re tired . ”
18786	18800	18726	18726	Hayes	2931	“ Have you had anything to eat today ? That never helps either . ”
18801	18807	18754	18754	She	135	“ Neither do uninvited guests . ”
18808	18811	18726	18726	Hayes	2931	“ Hayes . ”
18812	18815	18726	18726	Hayes	2931	“ Mother . ”
18816	18848	18849	18849	I	83	“ I realize you ’re old enough to take care of yourself , but it ’s been a difficult two weeks , and you should n’t be by yourself right now . ”
18877	18926	18927	18927	She	678	“ Mrs. Rutherford . Hi . I ’m Begonia . It is so good to meet you . Hayes has n’t told me much about you , but then , you could probably say the same about what he ’s told you about me , could n’t you ? ”
18986	18999	19000	19000	Giovanna	135	“ I ’m sorry , I have no idea who you are , ”
19059	19078	19079	19079	Hayes	2931	“ Relax , darling , I ’m quite all right with it if she does n’t like you . ”
19225	19244	19245	19246	My mom	2503	“ Begonia , meet my mother , Giovanna . Mother , this is Begonia Fairchild . My girlfriend . ”
19294	19299	19300	19300	she	2503	“ Ah , again ? ”
19411	19422	19423	19423	Hayes	348	“ Yes , Mother , I have a girlfriend again , ”
19426	19488	19423	19423	Hayes	348	“ Begonia and I met on a Snarflings World forum while I was incognito , moved private chats to phone calls , and I asked her to meet me here . She had no idea until this morning who I actually am , nor to whom I ’m related , and I ’d prefer if you do n’t make her uncomfortable . ”
19662	19673	19674	19674	Hayes	348	“ You can take your own luggage to your rooms , ”
19677	19695	19674	19674	Hayes	348	“ or , more preferably , to one of the other accommodations in town across the island . ”
19696	19706	19707	19711	the dark - haired diva	710	“ Did you run a background check on her ? ”
19758	19766	19767	19767	Hayes	348	“ Begonia , this is Amelia Shawcross , ”
19770	19821	19767	19767	Hayes	348	“ We went to grade school together . And this is Charlotte , my mother ’s personal assistant who deserved a Sunday off but apparently did n’t get it . I assume there ’s a security detail making the rounds outside . You ’ll meet them soon enough as well . ”
19834	19844	19822	19822	Amelia	81	“ Hayes and I got married in second grade . ”
19845	19854	19855	19855	I	83	“ Oh , that must ’ve been adorable . ”
19860	19931	19932	19932	Hayes	348	“ I married my dog when I was nine . My sister and I were arguing over who got to be the bride and who had to be the bridesmaid , so we decided to take turns , but when Mom heard me talking about a honeymoon with Oreo , she freaked out over what the neighbors would think , so Hyacinth never got to be Oreo ’s second wife . ”
19950	19956	19932	19932	Hayes	348	“ Is n’t she adorable ? ”
19957	19962	19968	19968	she	135	“ Quite … normal . ”
19990	20028	19974	19974	Amelia	81	“ You probably should n’t tell that story in mixed company if you do n’t want stories about yourself having sex with a dog spread across the tabloids . Have you ever dated someone famous , Begonia ? ”
20029	20067	20068	20068	I	83	“ Just Oreo . He ate the mayor ’s wife ’s roses and made the local papers for it . Mostly because he was n’t smart enough to stop after the first thorn made his tongue bleed . ”
20103	20157	20161	20161	their	714	“ But I ’m attracted to smarter creatures now . And Oreo ’s tongue was okay . It was n’t as bad as the news made it sound . Plus , he was recovering from the ol’ snip - snip and still had a lot of painkillers in his body when it happened . ”
20298	20305	20306	20306	I	83	“ Are any of you hungry ? ”
20309	20390	20306	20306	I	83	“ I think we have crackers . There was , erm , a refrigerator malfunction , so we ’re out of butter . I can use the house phone to order a Tuber to have some lobster rolls delivered . Have you had the lobster rolls from Clickety Clack ? They ’re delicious . And I think it ’s adorable that there ’s a local named Mr. Tuberman who runs the Tuber . It ’s like Uber , but not . ”
20391	20405	20406	20406	Hayes	348	“ They know where Clickety Clack is if they ’re hungry , darling , ”
20417	20424	20409	20409	Giovanna	135	“ Do n’t be a bear , ”
20430	20440	20425	20425	I	83	“ They ’ll think I ’m a bad influence . ”
20441	20449	20450	20450	Amelia	81	“ It ’s not you , Bernardia , ”
20453	20456	20457	20457	Hayes	348	“ Begonia , ”
20460	20472	20457	20457	Hayes	348	“ Though I prefer to think of her as my bluebell . ”
20473	20485	20486	20487	Amelia Shawcross	81	“ Of course you do . I was always your azalea . ”
20499	20508	20492	20495	Holy sweet da Vinci	148	“ You were on Dancing with the Stars . ”
20509	20516	20519	20519	Giovanna	135	“ Amelia ’s multi - talented . ”
20565	20608	20553	20553	She	81	“ She ’s quite brilliant in her day job on Wall Street , runs a popular finance blog , and would ’ve won that season if they had n’t let a former cheerleader with seven years of dance training into the competition . ”
20609	20614	20615	20615	I	83	“ You kicked ass , ”
20620	20695	20615	20615	I	83	“ I do n’t know how you kept up with everything while you were doing dance lessons for the show too . Seriously amazing . My sister and I could n’t stop talking about how we would ’ve been so exhausted after the first thirty minutes of rehearsals , but you killed it like a major lady boss . Such a great role model for young girls everywhere . High five , rock star . ”
20728	20738	20720	20720	he	725	“ You do n’t celebrate each other ’s successes ? ”
20742	20751	20752	20752	Hayes	348	“ And you wonder why I like her , ”
21063	21066	21052	21052	Hayes	348	“ Hayes , ”
21158	21161	21137	21137	my	83	“ Dog ! ”
21180	21183	21168	21168	I	83	“ Marsh — ”
21184	21187	21188	21188	Hayes	348	“ Sit , ”
21317	21320	21329	21329	Hayes	348	“ Marshmallow . ”
21321	21328	21329	21329	Hayes	348	“ Put . It . Back , ”
21387	21391	21392	21392	I	83	“ Good boy , ”
21570	21577	21578	21578	Begonia	348	“ Are you mad at me ? ”
21590	21603	21584	21584	I	83	“ Whyever would I be angry with you , my darling bluebell ? ”
21604	21629	21578	21578	Begonia	348	“ Sarcasm still is n’t attractive on you , but I ’d probably be cranky if I had n’t slept in seven days too . ”
21636	21648	21649	21649	she	348	“ You should ’ve told me about the weddings and funeral , ”
21652	21676	21677	21677	She	348	“ Your mother and Bachelorettes One and Two are not buying this fake relationship , because I do n’t know enough about you . ”
21836	21844	21845	21845	she	348	“ Were you close to your cousin ? ”
21848	21854	21845	21845	she	348	“ Begonia . Be quiet . ”
21855	22002	21845	21845	she	348	“ I did n’t sleep for almost a week after I moved into my apartment when I left Chad . I was bottling up everything inside , lying in bed at night second - guessing myself and wondering where I ’d gone wrong . I thought I could ’ve done something differently , and that I ’d been a bad wife when I ’d tried so hard to be a good wife . Then there was my mother , insisting I was a fool for leaving a decent man and that I ’d be alone forever . It took Hyacinth coming to see me and telling me she could n’t sleep because I could n’t sleep , and that we needed to talk it out so we could both sleep again . So we did . We talked it out , and then we both slept . ”
22014	22023	21845	21845	she	348	“ Why the hell could n’t Hyacinth sleep ? ”
22024	22043	22044	22044	I	83	“ Cosmic twin connection . Just like I had horrible cramps when she was in labor both times . ”
22389	22393	22394	22394	Begonia	83	“ Sit up , ”
22431	22437	22425	22426	the woman	453	“ What are you doing ? ”
22438	22467	22409	22409	Flowery	151	“ Helping you get to sleep . Your mom said dogs and strawberries are your only allergies . You ’re not allergic to lavender too , are you ? ”
22468	22471	22425	22426	the woman	453	“ No . ”
22472	22497	22425	22426	the woman	453	“ Good . I lit some lavender incense . Breathe deep . It ’ll help you relax . And sit up and scoot down . ”
22498	22501	22409	22409	Flowery	151	“ No . ”
22502	22517	22425	22426	the woman	453	“ Sit up and scoot down . Do n’t make me get your mother . ”
22518	22530	22425	22426	the woman	453	“ My mother would welcome any excuse to throw you out . ”
22531	22551	22552	22552	I	83	“ You really do n’t understand who you ’ve asked to be your fake girlfriend yet , do you ? ”
22698	22709	22710	22710	I	83	“ Yes , yes , you ’re a terrifying woman , ”
22713	22756	22757	22757	She	761	“ It was your master plan all along to lie in wait here so you could surprise the weird Rutherford brother and score yourself the last eligible billionaire on the planet , and now you have me right where you want me . ”
22781	22792	22777	22777	She	348	“ Sit . Up . And . Scoot . Down . ”
22832	22839	22828	22828	her	83	“ Lie down . Face up . ”
22840	22855	22807	22807	she	348	“ I ’m certainly not planning to return to that pillow face - down . ”
22856	22899	22900	22900	I	83	“ Do n’t be an ass . Lie down . I ’d very much like to not fake being madly in love with a grumpy - pants for the next two weeks , and that means you need to get some sleep ? ”
22938	22948	22949	22949	she	83	“ Close your eyes and take a deep breath , ”
23025	23033	23034	23034	she	348	“ Tell me if I hurt you , ”
23043	23049	23050	23050	she	348	“ Listen to the waves , ”
23058	23067	23053	23053	she	348	“ Just breathe and listen to the waves . ”
23154	23158	23159	23159	I	83	“ Strong fingers , ”
23162	23168	23159	23159	I	83	“ Is it too much ? ”
23871	23885	23855	23855	Hayes	348	“ Darling , I told you not to leave the estate without security . ”
24095	24102	24103	24103	I	83	“ We were out of food . ”
24155	24166	24176	24176	Amelia	81	“ No strawberries . But I did get more cheesecake . ”
24167	24175	24176	24176	Amelia	81	“ This is what Charlotte is for , ”
24180	24273	24274	24274	Hayes	348	“ Oh , but I love the market . It ’s so quaint and charming , and they have a nut butter maker , and I got a sample of the most delicious fresh almond butter that I ’ve ever had in my life . Do n’t worry — I got a jar to share , because you have to taste this . It ’s so good . And the market also let Marshmallow in with me , and no one minded when he carried my mangos around the store for me . ”
24310	24324	24302	24302	he	357	“ Come , Begonia . Sit . I ’ll load up the bike — ”
24325	24353	24354	24354	Amelia	81	“ No , no , I ’ll ride it back , if you ’ll take the groceries . And I ’ll start brunch when I get home . ”
24647	24656	24658	24658	he	801	“ Get in the golf cart , Begonia . ”
24939	24947	24948	24948	His	404	“ No . Walk me home instead . ”
24965	24983	24953	24953	he	404	“ It ’s not safe to wander off the estate by yourself when you ’re dating me . ”
24995	25018	24953	24953	he	404	“ Are kidnappers going to dash out from behind that rock and carry me off to torture me behind the lobster shack ? ”
25019	25025	24953	24953	he	404	“ You ’re being ridiculous . ”
25026	25076	25080	25081	market tabloids	811	“ There is a possibility some nosy busybody with a camera will take our picture and perpetuate this crazy story where the world ’s last single billionaire is madly in love with a divorced art teacher from Virginia . That would probably be a serious hit to your reputation . ”
25224	25235	25214	25215	Amelia Shawcross	81	“ My patience is in short supply , Ms. Fairchild . ”
25236	25259	25260	25260	I	83	“ Then you definitely have to walk me back to your place . Just breathe that air . Is n’t it amazing ? ”
25551	25577	25578	25578	Amelia	81	“ Hayes , your mother wants to know if she should send Charlotte into town for coffee , or if we ’re bringing some back , ”
25590	25637	25638	25638	She	81	“ Everything ’s set in the pot in the kitchen . It ’s my special coffee - of - the - month - club coffee . From Ecuador this month . And it ’s delicious . All she has to do is hit the power button . ”
25651	25672	25644	25644	I	83	“ People in your social circles do know how to hit the power button on a coffee maker , right ? ”
25673	25682	25683	25683	I	83	“ If not , there ’s always Charlotte . ”
25686	25697	25683	25683	I	83	“ Did you — did you just make a joke ? ”
25698	25701	25702	25702	His	824	“ No . ”
25714	25727	25710	25710	I	83	“ Well , you should ’ve . Jokes lower blood pressure too . ”
25728	25743	25744	25744	I	83	“ So does getting home and getting to work . Get in the cart . ”
25803	25842	25787	25787	he	824	“ Walk me home . It ’ll take an hour , and it ’ll clear your head before you disappear to do all of your work and leave me to entertain your mother and your ex - wife . ”
25851	25856	25787	25787	he	824	“ She is not — ”
25857	25924	25925	25925	I	83	“ Grade school wives who are super successful all on their own do n’t often come back when you ’re still single at your age , and when they do , they definitely do n’t get on a plane with your mother at the drop of a hat to go check on you at a secret hidey spot just because they had nothing better to do , ”
25928	25937	25925	25925	I	83	“ She ’s here because she wants you . ”
25938	25946	25961	25961	He	824	“ Congratulations on your powers of observation . ”
25947	25960	25961	25961	He	824	“ Walk with me . It ’s what a boyfriend would do . ”
26037	26040	26041	26041	Hayes	348	“ Amelia . ”
26058	26070	26071	26071	Her	83	“ We ’ll be walking home . Please take the groceries . ”
26075	26083	26071	26071	Her	83	“ Are you sure that ’s safe ? ”
26084	26097	26098	26098	I	83	“ I have the mayor on speed - dial if anything happens . ”
26235	26247	26248	26248	Amelia	81	“ There ’s no room for the bike on the cart , ”
26251	26263	26248	26248	Amelia	81	“ And there ’s no room in the security cart either . ”
26264	26271	26272	26272	I	83	“ We ’ll walk it back , ”
26276	26282	26284	26284	he	666	“ Along with — Marshmallow ! ”
26317	26320	26321	26321	Hayes	348	“ Down , ”
26490	26504	26505	26505	I	83	“ Hayes ! Hayes , hi . Everything okay out at the estate ? ”
26568	26605	26557	26557	Begonia	348	“ She ca n’t hurt you . She ’d get fired as mayor , and trust me , after what I heard at the market this morning , that ’s the last thing she ’d jeopardize . ”
26606	26621	26623	26623	I	83	“ For the record , this is the last place I want to be . ”
26657	26675	26676	26676	Begonia	348	“ But it ’s such a beautiful morning . That has to make it a little better , ”
26746	26758	26759	26759	Kristine	133	“ I ’m so glad I ran into you this morning , ”
26823	26848	26849	26849	I	83	“ Seems like you might be having connection problems with your gate intercom system . Hamish is still around if you need an electrician . ”
26874	26881	26861	26861	she	133	“ Ms. Turner . Lovely weather . ”
26882	26886	26887	26887	Begonia	348	“ Good job , ”
26917	26990	26991	26991	She	133	“ I called the sheriff ’s office up at the point and let them know you were back , so they ’re watching out for any unusual activity , though I see you ’re not as alone as we thought you were . And we activated the Oysterberry Bay gossip chain . Nobody ’s gon na bug you , and if you need anything at all , just give me a holler . ”
27108	27115	27116	27116	she	133	“ Glad to see you back , ”
27119	27179	27116	27116	she	133	“ I tried to get in touch when Blaine left and his girlfriend stayed , because it felt unusual , but nobody at your office returned my calls . The sheriff checked in every now and again , and it did n’t seem like she was robbing you , so we had no choice but to let it go . ”
27366	27375	27376	27376	Begonia	348	“ I love your island here , Kristine , ”
27383	27401	27402	27402	Kristine	133	“ Everyone ’s so friendly , and the shops are adorable . You must love living here . ”
27416	27435	27411	27411	Begonia	348	“ Could n’t imagine living anywhere else . Great place for keeping in touch with what ’s important . ”
27436	27475	27502	27502	she	133	“ You can really feel the love all over . This is the best hidden gem I ’ve ever visited . But do n’t worry — I wo n’t tell anyone . Too many tourists would ruin it . ”
27476	27483	27411	27411	Begonia	348	“ We aim for just right . ”
27484	27492	27493	27493	Begonia	348	“ You ’re doing a spectacular job . ”
27598	27604	27605	27605	Begonia	348	“ We should get going , ”
27609	27664	27665	27665	She	348	“ Lots to do today . Thank you so much for all of your kindness . Marshmallow ! Drop the crab and c’m on , boy . You do n’t want that thing biting your nose or tongue or your ears . Who ’s a good dog ? Marshmallow ’s such a good dog . ”
27676	27698	27665	27665	She	348	“ He ’s smart , but not always bright , you know ? And we love him exactly as he is . ”
27895	27902	27886	27886	I	83	“ Why did you get divorced ? ”
28033	28041	28019	28019	Begonia	348	“ He did n’t like my dog . ”
28042	28055	28088	28088	She	348	“ You did n’t adopt the dog until after you filed paperwork . ”
28056	28071	28019	28019	Begonia	348	“ Just how thorough was that background check , and did you memorize it ? ”
28072	28087	28088	28088	She	348	“ Why did you get divorced ? As your boyfriend , I should know . ”
28096	28127	28088	28088	She	348	“ You should , should n’t you ? Okay . I ’ll tell you . But first , you have to tell me if you ’ve ever had a pet . ”
28201	28223	28197	28197	they	884	“ You do n’t want to ask how many other women will be arriving on my doorstep vying for my attention ? ”
28224	28385	28386	28386	Her	885	“ Oh , you think there ’ll be more ? Will there be any actresses ? Oh ! What about famous artists ? Wait . They probably do n’t want you for your money , and your personality is n’t exactly the type that usually jives with artists . We like to be the temperamental ones in a relationship , and we love being broke , because it gives us something to complain about . Oh , barf . Tell me you ’re not expecting a bunch of lady CEOs . Do n’t get me wrong , I admire the crap out of them for the things they accomplish , and Amelia is lovely in her own way — I mean , she ca n’t be barf when she was on Dancing with the Stars — but give me someone who wants to talk about how difficult clay can be in humidity , and I ’ll have a new BFF . ”
28409	28418	28419	28419	She	885	“ Clay is related to bank failure Fridays ? ”
28430	28452	28419	28419	She	885	“ You did it again . You made a joke . Sleeping was really good for you , was n’t it ? ”
28453	28482	28391	28391	she	885	“ Please tell me you do n’t drink coffee . Or that you ’ve already had six cups today . One or the other . Nothing in between . ”
28483	28504	28505	28505	I	83	“ Nope . I ’m riding the high from horrifying your mother when she came into our bedroom last night . ”
28511	28521	28505	28505	I	83	“ My mother came into the bedroom last night ? ”
28528	28536	28505	28505	I	83	“ What did you say to her ? ”
28537	28558	28559	28559	She	83	“ I shushed her and told her you ’d had a few long days and that you needed your sleep . ”
28564	28597	28559	28559	She	83	“ She was really horrified . Is it a Rutherford family thing that you ’re not supposed to be shirtless with a woman in bed in real life in your own home ? ”
28598	28601	28602	28602	She	83	“ Yes . ”
28621	28683	28616	28616	she	83	“ Is it the hair dye ? I was worried yesterday about leaving it on too long , but I actually like how bright it turned out . It ’s like , hello , world , Begonia is ready to experience all of you again . But hair dye is n’t against your family ’s principles and image , is it ? ”
28684	28693	28559	28559	She	83	“ Yes . It ’s the hair dye . ”
28694	28713	28559	28559	She	83	“ Are you always a bad liar , or are you just trying to make me stop talking ? ”
28714	28717	28718	28720	The confounding woman	887	“ Yes . ”
28723	28829	28830	28830	I	83	“ So sleep does n’t make you more charming . Noted . Were you up early enough to see the sun rise ? It was glorious this morning . Like Monet painted it . I know it ’s totally cliché for an art teacher to say Monet ’s her favorite , when I could pick Berthe Morisot or Alfred Sisley , or a non - impressionist , but Monet ’s colors are like — looking at his water lilies collection is like seeing the full potential of my soul on display . They make me happy and peaceful and hopeful all at the same time . ”
28833	28842	28830	28830	I	83	“ Have you been to Musée Marmottan Monet ? ”
28843	28880	28881	28881	Her	888	“ No , but it ’s totally on the bucket list . I started a Paris fund the day I left Chad , and if I budget right , I can get there in two years . ”
28955	29007	29008	29008	She	888	“ When I was six , my parents got us a puppy for the holidays . I came down with a horrible cold the same day and lived in utter misery for a week while hugging that damn dog at every opportunity until my nanny suggested I was allergic to it . ”
29013	29022	29008	29008	She	888	“ I ’m sorry . That ’s heartbreaking . ”
29023	29036	29008	29008	She	888	“ We had fish tanks instead for the rest of my childhood . ”
29037	29128	29008	29008	She	888	“ My dad ran a summer camp . Mom hated it , which is why they got divorced , but I loved it . Hyacinth and I spent every summer there , running wild and playing on the ropes course and shooting archery and swimming in the pool and riding horses and fishing in the lake . We had minnows for bait , but neither of us could bear to actually hook them , so we ’d sneak them back to our cabin and try to raise them as pets . ”
29129	29139	29140	29140	Her	891	“ We had jellyfish and stingrays in our tanks . ”
29160	29166	29155	29155	she	891	“ Of course you did . ”
29174	29188	29189	29189	She	891	“ There was a very large grouper that I named O - face . ”
29192	29197	29189	29189	She	891	“ You did n’t . ”
29198	29233	29234	29234	Her	891	“ I was informed quickly that the grouper preferred to not be mocked for its expression , and it was renamed Theodore . And the octopus that I named Octopussy was rapidly renamed Harrison . ”
29333	29350	29351	29351	Begonia	83	“ Hyacinth named an entire batch of minnows after all the roles Jonas played one summer , ”
29366	29375	29376	29376	she	891	“ Do you not get along with Jonas ? ”
29379	29394	29376	29376	she	891	“ Or does it just annoy you that everyone thinks he ’s so perfect ? ”
29395	29420	29351	29351	Begonia	83	“ You accused me of setting you up yesterday , but I ’m beginning to wonder if the opposite is true , Ms. Fairchild . ”
29421	29604	29376	29376	she	891	“ Do n’t Ms. Fairchild me , Mr. Rutherford . I saw you in dancing hamster pajama pants . Fancy does n’t work between us anymore . Also , I work with teenagers , and I have yet to see any set of siblings who adore each other all the time , even the ones who like each other most of the time . It ’s not natural to not have conflict with your family . If Hyacinth was as famous as Jonas is , I ’d probably sigh like that too . And we might be twins and adore each other , but we fight plenty too . Hello ? Signed non - disclosure agreement ? You have a very rare opportunity to bare your soul to someone who wo n’t repeat a word , wo n’t judge you and who ’s had enough therapy in the past year to probably say some very insightful things about your life that just might make you smile more often . Hit me with it . What ’s the story with you and Jonas ? ”
29605	29610	29376	29376	she	891	“ He got married . ”
29611	29619	29351	29351	Begonia	83	“ You wanted his wife for yourself ? ”
29620	29650	29376	29376	she	891	“ Dear god , no . I did n’t want to be the richest single man in the world . It makes me a target for more attention than — ”
29651	29654	29655	29655	someone	334	“ Hayes ! ”
29662	29681	29655	29655	someone	334	“ Oh my gosh , Hayes ! That is you . Hi ! Hi , I ’m Martina . ”
29682	29691	29692	29692	I	83	“ In short , it makes that happen , ”
29698	29704	29705	29705	Begonia	348	“ Back off , lady , ”
29708	29714	29715	29717	The elderly woman	898	“ This one ’s mine . ”
29725	29749	29715	29717	The elderly woman	898	“ Well , are n’t you an impertinent little twit . I was just being friendly to a neighbor I ’ve never met . ”
29753	29773	29774	29774	Martina	167	“ Sorry . I ’m terribly jealous . I thought you wanted him for his butt in these jeans . ”
29779	29815	29774	29774	Martina	167	“ If I did want him , and I ’m not saying I do , but if I did , could you blame me ? I might be old , but I ’m not blind . ”
29816	29826	29827	29827	Begonia	348	“ Keep being fabulous and putting yourself out there . ”
29871	29907	29908	29908	Begonia	348	“ We need to get going . Hayes is late for work , and if he does n’t work , he ca n’t afford to treat me to a lobster dinner on a sunset cruise . ”
29916	29954	29911	29913	The old lady	348	“ Oh , you ’re a cheeky one . A billionaire not affording a lobster dinner . Ha ! Come say hi at the flower shop , Hayes . Your girlfriend deserves it . I like her . ”
29955	29964	29965	29965	I	83	“ How the devil do you do that ? ”
29985	29989	29970	29970	she	348	“ Do what ? ”
29990	29998	29970	29970	she	348	“ Make friends with anything that moves . ”
29999	30035	29970	29970	she	348	“ All people just want to be accepted for who they are . It ’s not that hard to tell someone they have a nice haircut or a great smile or excellent taste in butts . ”
30036	30041	29970	29970	she	348	“ That sounds exhausting . ”
30042	30059	29970	29970	she	348	“ It brings me so much joy to see people happy . Way worth the effort . ”
30060	30064	29970	29970	she	348	“ All people ? ”
30065	30124	30125	30125	I	83	“ I do n’t like to think about people who do n’t deserve to be happy , which means I basically refuse to acknowledge they exist , unless I have to , like when I think they ’re a tuxedo - clad murderer bursting into my bathroom , so in my little world , yes . All people . ”
30387	30426	30368	30368	she	348	“ Your mom said you just took over as the Chief Financial Officer for Razzle Dazzle — does that mean long hours and endless meetings ? And can you really do it from here with limited cell service ? ”
30427	30436	30437	30437	I	83	“ We ’ll go to Paris this weekend , ”
30443	30446	30440	30440	She	348	“ What ? ”
30447	30494	30495	30495	She	348	“ You ’ve never seen Musée Marmottan Monet . A weekend trip to Paris for you to see Monet ’s waterlilies is pocket change to me , and an impromptu date in Europe will solidify the rumors that I am not , in fact , eligible . ”
30507	30518	30495	30495	She	348	“ But — but I have n’t earned it yet . ”
30519	30524	30440	30440	She	348	“ You — pardon ? ”
30525	30717	30718	30718	She	911	“ It ’s an incredibly generous offer . I do n’t mean to imply I do n’t appreciate it . I do . That ’s so thoughtful and kind , but while it ’s pocket change to you , to me , it ’s the entire experience of saving and anticipating and savoring the idea . Like Christmas morning . Do you live for those five minutes when you ’re tearing through the wrapping paper , or do you live for the months from the minute you start making your wish list and talking to your friends about what you ’re hoping to get ? And like , dreaming about the pony you ’ll find in the backyard , even knowing that your dad declared bankruptcy this year and ca n’t afford a pony . Plus knowing that your mom and stepdad would never get you anything that would make poop that has to be cleaned . But you spend all those months dreaming and waiting anyway until that moment when you see the tree and the presents under it , and it ’s like , the joy of the possible ? ”
30746	30762	30741	30741	she	911	“ You would rather anticipate seeing your favorite paintings than actually see your favorite paintings ? ”
30772	30825	30763	30763	Her	911	“ Never mind . You ’re right . We should go to Paris . It ’ll keep up appearances . Marshmallow ! Sweetie , do n’t eat the rock . Where did — oh . Yes . Okay , good boy . Good boy helping push the bike back to the house . ”
30857	30876	30877	30877	She	911	“ He could ’ve made such a great service dog , but he does n’t take orders well . ”
30891	31004	30883	30883	she	911	“ He knows how to do all the things , but it ’s like he ’s missing that part of his brain where he understands that he ’s supposed to do it when people tell him to , instead of when he wants to . And he went through three owners who thought it was cute at first and then could n’t live with him , and so I adopted him because he deserves to be loved for who he is , flaws and all , and so do I , so we make a good pair . Especially now that I ’ve figured out how to Marshmallow - proof my apartment . ”
31018	31055	31056	31056	She	914	“ The animal will survive without you for a weekend . I have competent staff who can arrive within a day to learn his eccentricities before we depart . And we need to keep up appearances . ”
31068	31083	31056	31056	She	914	“ I do n’t actually have a passport . That ’s the other issue . ”
31084	31092	31211	31211	She	916	“ I ’ll make a phone call . ”
31093	31098	31211	31211	She	916	“ That ’s cheating . ”
31099	31210	31211	31211	She	916	“ I live in a world where my every public move is under scrutiny , where I ’m judged based on the fantasy world of the films my family puts out into the world rather than on the world we actually live in , where people befriend me for every reason except enjoying my company , and where my acquaintances are just as likely to double - cross me as they are to follow through on their promises . So if the other side of that coin is that I can make a phone call to have a passport application expedited , then I ’ll make the damn phone call . ”
31225	31237	31211	31211	She	916	“ You ’re very suspicious of the world and its intentions . ”
31238	31247	31291	31291	she	917	“ Welcome to my life , Ms. Fairchild . ”
31248	31256	31291	31291	she	917	“ So why do you trust me ? ”
31257	31278	31279	31281	The damn woman	917	“ I do n’t so much trust you as I trust that I can destroy you if I need to . ”
31577	31592	31593	31593	she	917	“ I ’ll find a sitter for Marshmallow and go to Paris with you , ”
31597	31604	31593	31593	she	917	“ but only on one condition . ”
31605	31621	31593	31593	she	917	“ You ’re mistaken if you think you have room for negotiation , Ms. Fairchild . ”
31622	31637	31638	31638	she	917	“ I ’ll find a sitter for Marshmallow and go to Paris with you , ”
31641	31655	31656	31656	I	83	“ and in return , I want you to have sex with me . ”
31703	31708	31709	31709	I	83	“ There it is , ”
31712	31726	31709	31709	I	83	“ We ’ll be ending this relationship the minute we get back to — ”
31727	31746	31690	31690	she	917	“ Quit being a pompous ass who thinks this is about me taking advantage of you and listen . ”
31775	31812	31813	31813	she	917	“ You do n’t have to kiss me , you do n’t have to look at me , we do n’t have to have the lights on , and we can keep touching to a minimum , ”
31816	31857	31813	31813	she	917	“ There will definitely be multiple forms of birth control in place , and I ’ll sign whatever you need me to sign , agreeing to whatever you need me to agree to in the event of something unexpected happening . ”
31868	31974	31864	31864	she	917	“ I just — I have n’t slept with anyone since Chad , and I want to move on . Physically . I need to take that leap , and I ’m not quite afraid of it , but I have n’t been putting myself out there either , and you ’re here , and we ’re pretending to be dating , and you ’ve already seen me naked , and your mother caught us in bed together , and I would n’t even care if you wanted to call me by someone else ’s name to make it palatable enough for you , so — ”
31994	32076	31985	31985	she	83	“ Never mind . Never mind . Forget I said anything . This is a terrible idea . I ’m done talking . Fine . We ’ll go to Paris . I ’ll ask Kristine for someone here on the island who ’s good with strong - willed and over - trained dogs , and I ’ll go pop my post - divorce cherry with some lovely fisherman in the village once our two weeks of fake - dating is over . ”
32353	32356	32339	32339	Begonia	348	“ Begonia . ”
32357	32389	32398	32398	She	440	“ I know , I know . We have to get back to the house together and look like everything ’s fine . Just — I need a minute , okay ? ”
32390	32393	32339	32339	Begonia	348	“ Begonia . ”
32394	32397	32398	32398	She	440	“ What ? ”
32463	32511	32457	32457	you	938	“ I ’ll be finished with work by four , so we can take the sunset cruise for dinner . If you do n’t have a dress you ’d like to wear , I ’ll have Charlotte take you into town to go shopping . My treat . ”
32512	32522	32546	32546	She	940	“ I do n’t want your money , Hayes . ”
32523	32545	32546	32546	She	940	“ You ca n’t fake - date a billionaire without taking advantage of it , bluebell . It ’s just money . ”
32584	32591	32592	32592	she	940	“ Thank you for your generosity , ”
32597	32663	32592	32592	she	940	“ I ’m sure I have a dress in my luggage that will work , but if I have to be in something new to be seen in public with you , I ’ll clear my calendar for this afternoon and go shopping with your mother ’s personal assistant . I ’m sure it ’ll be a wonderful time to get to know her better . ”
32790	32796	32797	32797	She	726	“ Good morning , dear . ”
32896	32899	32900	32900	she	2637	“ Begonia , ”
32912	32922	32900	32900	she	2637	“ You ’re looking fresh and lovely this morning . ”
32943	32959	32962	32962	I	83	“ Thank you , Mrs. Rutherford . You look like you belong in a movie . ”
32980	32989	32990	32990	Hayes	348	“ She ’s had a lot of practice , ”
33386	33390	33391	33391	Hayes	348	“ Close it , ”
33417	33423	33411	33411	I	83	“ I ’ll get it . ”
33483	33489	33490	33490	Giovanna	135	“ What a sweet dog . ”
33497	33509	33492	33492	Hayes	348	“ Go take your Benadryl and stop tormenting the poor thing . ”
33723	33731	33732	33732	I	83	“ I ’ll finish chopping the vegetables , ”
33788	33801	33881	33881	He	980	“ You can go put your feet up and enjoy your coffee . ”
33802	33811	33818	33818	Hayes	348	“ Nonsense . We ’ll chop vegetables together . ”
33812	33817	33818	33818	Hayes	348	“ Where ’s Charlotte ? ”
33821	33880	33881	33881	He	980	“ Sleeping in . She ’s earned a day or two off after all the wedding excitement . Shoo . Go on . We know you ca n’t wait to get back to work . Begonia will come find you when brunch is ready . But let me get you a cup of coffee . It ’s delicious . ”
33939	33946	33947	33947	he	980	“ You ’re going home today , ”
34059	34071	34072	34072	Giovanna	135	“ No , I think we ’ll stay another few days , ”
34075	34138	34072	34072	Giovanna	135	“ Amelia has n’t been out here since you were teenagers , and I promised her we ’d explore town together . There ’s a lovely new art gallery I have n’t seen yet . And then I get to know Begonia better , and we all make sure you ’re not working too hard . Goodness knows that takes a village . ”
34228	34235	34236	34236	Hayes	348	“ You ’re going home today , ”
34317	34331	34312	34312	Giovanna	135	“ Hayes , the house is plenty big enough for all of us — ”
34332	34345	34312	34312	Giovanna	135	“ Which does n’t change the fact that you were n’t invited . ”
34346	34384	34312	34312	Giovanna	135	“ I do n’t care if you ’re ten or sixty , I ’m your mother , and I know when you ’re in a mood and need to be checked on . This lone wolf routine — ”
34385	34405	34312	34312	Giovanna	135	“ Yes , I ’m clearly alone and suffering for being here for a private getaway with my girlfriend . ”
34475	34489	34457	34457	Hayes	348	“ Begonia and I will join you in New York early next week . ”
34534	34538	34539	34539	Giovanna	135	“ Next week ? ”
34542	34560	34561	34561	he	84	“ I ’m fully equipped to telework from here while I learn my new role this week , ”
34570	34584	34561	34561	he	84	“ And then I get to spend the weekend with Begonia without you . ”
34585	34588	34561	34561	he	84	“ Hayes — ”
34589	34601	34602	34602	I	83	“ I want time alone with my girlfriend . Go away . ”
34686	34699	34671	34671	Hayes	348	“ Thank you , bluebell . Just the way I like it . ”
34700	34703	34704	34704	I	83	“ Wait , ”
34724	34728	34729	34729	I	83	“ Cinnamon first . ”
34776	34788	34789	34789	Giovanna	135	“ Hayes does n’t take cinnamon in his coffee , dear , ”
34792	34807	34808	34808	I	83	“ He ’s trying my favorite since I could n’t shut up about it , ”
34818	34830	34815	34815	Hayes	348	“ Begonia insisted it ’s delicious , and she ’s right . ”
34899	34912	34913	34913	Hayes	348	“ Remember , darling , you promised no tomatoes in those eggs , ”
34948	34960	34961	34961	I	83	“ Making you happy is my favorite thing in the world , ”
35088	35099	35100	35100	Hayes	348	“ If only I did n’t have to work today , ”
35211	35250	35202	35202	he	325	“ Delicious . I ’ll never drink coffee another way again . Mother . Pack your bags . You can stay for brunch , and then you ’re leaving by two . I ’ll book your ferry myself . ”
35283	35297	35298	35298	she	135	“ So he ’s not your first boyfriend who likes to issue orders ? ”
35301	35307	35308	35308	I	83	“ He ’s a man . ”
35312	35328	35329	35329	She	135	“ We have to put up with the ego to get the rest of them . ”
35415	35431	35432	35432	she	1004	“ Oh , goodness . Snort - laughing does n’t happen often , does it ? ”
35467	35474	35475	35475	Amelia	156	“ Giovanna ? Are you okay ? ”
35537	35546	35547	35548	The man	357	“ Begonia has quite the sense of humor . ”
35583	35593	35594	35594	Amelia	156	“ A sense of humor is a nice change , ”
35597	35611	35594	35594	Amelia	156	“ Did n’t you say his last girlfriend was an engineering grad student ? ”
35612	35618	35619	35619	I	83	“ Oh , what kind ? ”
35622	35711	35712	35712	Amelia	156	“ My stepfather ’s a civil engineer . You would n’t think he had a sense of humor , but Hyacinth and I used to distract him all the time with knock - knock jokes . It ’d take him out of a bad mood like that . Mostly because he had about seven thousand of them memorized , and we only had to laugh at the first dozen or so before he ’d yell for my mom to come listen too , and then we ’d disappear . ”
35733	35745	35717	35717	Giovanna	135	“ You ’re quite laid - back , are n’t you ? ”
35756	35816	35717	35717	Giovanna	135	“ The sun ’s shining , the scenery is gorgeous , and I have a cantankerous boyfriend with a heart of gold under all his gruff . What ’s to be upset about ? Unless you ’re the kind who gets hangry , I suppose . Marshmallow ! Put the knife down . You know you ca n’t cook . ”
35852	35864	35865	35865	Amelia	156	“ It ’s interesting that Hayes does n’t mind your dog . ”
35883	35912	35865	35865	Amelia	156	“ He made me give up my dog when we got married in second grade , and I ’d swear he ’s only gotten more uptight since then . ”
35913	35922	35923	35923	I	83	“ Oh , he does n’t like Marshmallow . ”
35933	35976	35977	35977	I	83	“ I gave him an ultimatum . Me with the dog , or no me at all . Honestly , I thought he ’d tell me to pack my bags , but I guess I ’m worth taking daily allergy medicine for . ”
35996	36006	36007	36007	Giovanna	135	“ Do you have plans this afternoon , Begonia ? ”
36010	36022	36007	36007	Giovanna	135	“ We ’d love to have you join us in town . ”
36023	36028	36029	36029	Amelia	81	“ Such a treat , ”
36245	36250	36251	36251	I	83	“ You’re … staying ? ”
36258	36271	36272	36272	she	726	“ Cantankerous with a heart of gold , I believe you said ? ”
36275	36307	36272	36272	she	726	“ After two weddings and that devastating funeral , you ’ll excuse me if I want to make sure he ’s fine for myself . Do you have children , Begonia ? ”
36308	36312	36238	36238	she	726	“ Just Marshmallow . ”
36313	36408	36272	36272	she	726	“ I could n’t sleep if I was n’t here to see for myself that he ’s fine . It does n’t matter how old or self - sufficient your children get , there ’s no replacing a mother ’s worry . So forgive me for staying an extra day to take my son ’s new girlfriend shopping while still hovering closely enough to be here if he needs me . My security team is excellent , so we wo n’t have to worry about being interrupted if we do n’t want to be . ”
36409	36420	36421	36421	I	83	“ Oh , but everyone in town is so nice . ”
37039	37046	37047	37051	a white - bearded sailor	1054	“ Evenin ’ , Mr. Rutherford , ”
37068	37088	37089	37089	Begonia	83	“ Sea ’s a little choppy tonight , but do n’t you worry . You ’re in good hands . ”
37360	37365	37366	37366	I	83	“ Are you ill ? ”
37369	37374	37375	37375	she	348	“ I ’m great , ”
37378	37386	37375	37375	she	348	“ Is that dress cutting off circulation ? ”
37387	37401	37375	37375	she	348	“ Breathing great . Veins and arteries running in tip - top shape . ”
37426	37429	37423	37424	a liar	1063	“ Begonia . ”
37441	37446	37447	37447	Amelia	156	“ Problems in paradise ? ”
37538	37548	37549	37549	Begonia	83	“ Can I talk to you for a second ? ”
37552	37558	37549	37549	Begonia	83	“ Of course , darling . ”
37559	37570	37588	37588	She	348	“ I wo n’t make us late , I swear . ”
37571	37587	37588	37588	She	348	“ The captain wo n’t leave without us , even if we take two hours . ”
37665	37672	37673	37673	I	83	“ Spit it out , bluebell , ”
37676	37741	37673	37673	I	83	“ The last time I got on a sailboat on the ocean , it tipped over , and I almost drowned . I mean , I did n’t actually , but I felt like I might for a minute , and I have n’t been able to get on a boat since . My intentions are n’t bigger than my fears in this case . ”
37742	37751	37802	37802	she	1071	“ If you do n’t want to go — ”
37752	37783	37802	37802	she	1071	“ I do ! I do . I was supposed to go sailing this mor — while I ’m here — because I want to get over it , but — ”
37784	37788	37789	37789	I	83	“ This morning , ”
37817	37823	37812	37812	Her	1071	“ It ’s not important . ”
37857	37873	37834	37834	She	1071	“ How many excursions and side trips had you booked that you ’ve now changed ? ”
37874	37880	37834	37834	She	1071	“ It does n’t matter . ”
37881	37884	37834	37834	She	1071	“ Begonia . ”
37885	37984	37834	37834	She	1071	“ Shh . Your name - saying privileges have been revoked . Actually , your talking privileges have been revoked , period . I ’m trying to tell you that I ’m going to get on that boat , but I ’m a little nervous because the last time , Hyacinth saved me , and she ’s not here , so if I fall off the boat and once again come face - to - face with a killer manatee who decides I need to be his lover , I wo n’t have her twinstinct to save me . ”
37985	37999	37834	37834	She	1071	“ There are no manatees in Maine , and even if there were — ”
38000	38106	38107	38107	I	83	“ But there are other sea creatures , and they ’re like Marshmallow . They ’re not normal when I ’m around . Manatees are n’t killer , I know , but I swear to you , that manatee had a look in his eyes that either meant , you ’re the girl I ’ve been waiting for , Begonia , which is totally creepy , by the way , or you are the prey I ’ve been waiting for , Begonia . I ’m a very good swimmer , but if I fall off this boat , there ’s no telling what might happen . ”
38147	38233	38234	38234	She	1074	“ Fine . Fine . I ’ll get on the boat . It ’s an adventure , and I wanted an adventure , and I know that you ’re so big and powerful that you ’ll order the seas to quit chopping and they ’ll calm down and rainbows will appear and three whales will serenade us with a blowhole symphony , from a safe distance , of course , and everyone in town will talk about how talented you are for decades to come . ”
38258	38470	38242	38242	I	83	“ And it was n’t a horny manatee . I lied . I made up the lie , and Hyacinth told it so many times I started to believe it , but the truth is , I actually get seasick , and I hate that I get seasick , because I want to go cruise around the world but the one time Chad and I took a cruise , I puked on the first day and got put in quarantine in the ship ’s hospital because they were afraid I had norovirus , and being in an enclosed space on a cruise ship meant that I was ill the entire trip , so I did n’t enjoy it at all , and I really , really want to learn to enjoy it , but I do n’t want to puke in front of your mom and your second - grade ex - wife and your mom ’s Hayes - hungry assistant , and if I ’m puking , and I do fall overboard , I do n’t know if I ’ll actually be able to swim , because you ca n’t swim while you ’re puking . I can kayak . I can canoe . But I ca n’t freaking sail . ”
38471	38476	38477	38478	my mother	348	“ Is everything okay ? ”
38481	38501	38502	38502	I	83	“ I ’m failing to have the proper appreciation for the horror of the run in Begonia ’s hose , ”
38506	38511	38512	38512	she	348	“ Apologies , Begonia , ”
38515	38542	38512	38512	she	348	“ God knows I ’ve tried , but his understanding of pantyhose falls into the same bucket with his ego . They ’re both completely hopeless . ”
38543	38550	38551	38551	I	83	“ The boat wo n’t tip , ”
38556	38597	38598	38598	She	348	“ nor will you fall off , nor will you throw up , but if any or all of the above happen , I swear on my firm belief in the magic of the world , Marshmallow will save you . ”
38604	38664	38598	38598	She	348	“ I spent the past year getting divorced after four years of being married to a complete stick in the mud , and two years before that dating him , and I ’m trying so hard to remember who I was before him , but there are still a few things that scare me or make me super uncomfortable . ”
38686	38695	38682	38682	I	83	“ And those other things would be … ? ”
38696	38711	38598	38598	She	348	“ Paragliding , being squeezed to death by an anaconda , and lightning bugs . ”
38712	38716	38789	38789	She	1076	“ Lightning bugs ? ”
38717	38788	38789	38789	She	1076	“ One flew up my nose and got caught in my sinus cavity when I was at a party I was n’t supposed to be at in high school , and you do not want to know what it took to get it out , which is really sad , because I have such great memories of chasing lightning bugs with Hyacinth at Dad ’s summer camp , but now ... ”
38804	38820	38789	38789	She	1076	“ Excuse me , Captain . Have you ever lost anyone on a dinner cruise ? ”
38821	38826	38827	38827	My	83	“ Only Boone Decker . ”
38866	38897	38861	38864	The old captain cackles	1079	“ Just yankin ’ your chain , Mr. Rutherford . Ai n’t ever lost anybody . Come on aboard . We ’re aiming for some fun with your dinner tonight . ”
38898	38904	38905	38905	Begonia	83	“ Who ’s Boone Decker ? ”
38908	38915	38905	38905	Begonia	83	“ Why does that sound familiar ? ”
38916	38922	38923	38923	I	83	“ Founder of Rhythm Airlines , ”
38928	38948	38923	38923	I	83	“ Disappeared off the coast of France ten years ago with the authorities on his tail for insider trading . ”
38949	38958	38905	38905	Begonia	83	“ Oh ! He was making a joke . ”
38959	38972	38979	38980	my mother	348	“ Yes , Begonia , he was attempting to make a joke . ”
38973	38978	38979	38980	my mother	348	“ You naughty man , ”
38996	39009	38985	38985	she	348	“ I sincerely hope the rest of your entertainment is less morbid . ”
39010	39074	39090	39091	my mother	348	“ I ’m a sailor , ma’am , but I ’ll do my best . Evening , Ms. Shawcross . Lovely dress . Color of lobsters . Gon na have to watch out for mermen jumping up into the boat tonight , wo n’t we ? Charlotte , my dear . Glad to see you get to eat tonight too , for once . ”
39075	39089	39090	39091	my mother	348	“ We always make sure Charlotte gets what she needs , Captain Hollingsworth , ”
39095	39099	39100	39100	Begonia	83	“ Except you , ”
39106	39128	39100	39100	Begonia	83	“ Have you ever looked at Charlotte like that ? Because I ’m pretty sure she ’s in love with you . ”
39129	39132	39100	39100	Begonia	83	“ No . ”
39133	39161	39175	39175	She	348	“ No , you have n’t thought of her as a potential girlfriend , or no , you do n’t think she ’s in love with you ? ”
39162	39174	39175	39175	She	348	“ Is this conversation helping you to get on the boat ? ”
39221	39231	39232	39232	she	348	“ I have a twenty stuffed into my cleavage , ”
39235	39277	39232	39232	she	348	“ Do you think if I slipped it to him , he ’d close up the boat and leave with your mom and Amelia and Charlotte before we can get on it ? We could have a picnic on the beach . ”
39278	39292	39293	39293	She	348	“ With what food ? All the shops are closed for the evening . ”
39298	39303	39293	39293	She	348	“ Such little imagination . ”
39381	39394	39367	39367	I	83	“ It will require something larger than a twenty - dollar bill . ”
39395	39406	39407	39407	I	83	“ Nonsense . Captain Hollingsworth seems like a reasonable man . ”
39411	39415	39416	39416	I	83	“ Stay here . ”
39422	39426	39416	39416	I	83	“ You too . ”
39591	39597	39585	39585	I	83	“ Do I have crumbs ? ”
39598	39604	39605	39605	He	183	“ This is oddly delicious . ”
39661	39681	39646	39646	I	83	“ Even commoners on coastal islands have to eat , and sometimes they like their food to taste good . ”
39682	39722	39723	39723	I	83	“ Yoohoo ! Mr. Rutherford ? We wo n’t look if you want to kiss on Ms. Begonia here , but we heard you were having an impromptu romantic date , and we thought you might like some music . ”
39747	39761	39739	39739	I	83	“ Oh my gosh , yes ! That is so sweet of you ! ”
39762	39771	39772	39772	Hayes	156	“ You have n’t heard them play yet , ”
39775	39796	39772	39772	Hayes	156	“ Do n’t be so negative . How often do you get serenaded by people who rarely have an audience ? ”
39797	39803	39739	39739	I	83	“ You ’d be surprised . ”
39804	39842	39843	39843	His	1098	“ Hush and eat your peas , or there ’s no pie for you . And if that pie tastes half as good as it smelled while it was baking this afternoon , you definitely want pie . ”
39863	39865	39861	39861	he	1098	“ pie ”
39891	39940	39941	39945	the ringleader of the violinists	1100	“ We ’ll take a minute to get warmed up , and then it ’ll be nothing but the best music you ’ve ever heard outside of a symphony hall until our fingers fall off or you decide it ’s time for you or us to go home , ”
39982	39992	39993	39993	I	83	“ Thank you so much for giving us music , ”
40000	40012	39993	39993	I	83	“ I ’m sure you have better things to do tonight . ”
40013	40018	40019	40022	All three of them	1040	“ Just the dishes . ”
40030	40042	40043	40043	He	1100	“ What ’s the strangest place you ’ve ever been serenaded ? ”
40069	40138	40139	40139	I	83	“ I was with Jonas in Los Angeles , with limited security . He was coated in stage make - up that made him look approximately sixty - five for a fifty years later scene , and he wanted a cheeseburger from a local joint just outside the studio ’s gates . Seemed safe enough , but a small gang of teenage girls spotted him and recognized him . ”
40142	40161	40139	40139	I	83	“ Hyacinth totally would ’ve been in that group . So you were serenaded in a burger joint ? ”
40162	40234	40235	40235	I	83	“ No . We took off at a run , and we ended up thinking we ’d lost them when we dove into a single port - a - john at the edge of an alleyway , but teenage girls are terrifyingly smart , and they surrounded us , belting out the tunes from that god - awful film where he played a rock star until security arrived and rescued him . ”
40259	40274	40243	40243	I	83	“ At least you know this performance ca n’t possibly stink like that one . ”
40286	40292	40243	40243	I	83	“ I concede your point . ”
40351	40355	40356	40356	I	83	“ For appearances , ”
40555	40561	40593	40593	he	1104	“ Serenade in G Major , ”
40601	40610	40593	40593	he	1104	“ Hey ! Hey ! Get back here . ”
40630	40635	40593	40593	he	1104	“ Paparazzi ! Paparazzi ! ”
40650	40656	40657	40657	someone	334	“ Go back to playing , ”
40663	40669	40657	40657	someone	334	“ We ’ll get him ! ”
40684	40708	40676	40676	his	2931	“ That will be quite effective in convincing my mother to stop throwing other women at me for a while . Thank you . ”
40718	40722	40676	40676	his	2931	“ You knew ? ”
40723	40735	40736	40736	He	2931	“ Hush , now , darling , the sea has ears . ”
40743	40757	40758	40758	He	2931	“ And I ’m sure my security detail will do what ’s necessary . ”
41022	41033	41014	41014	he	2931	“ Why do you want to be alone so badly ? ”
41133	41142	41143	41143	he	2931	“ I do n’t wish to be alone , ”
41147	41160	41143	41143	he	2931	“ But my life does n’t lend itself to any other option . ”
41161	41165	41143	41143	he	2931	“ Why not ? ”
41166	41281	41304	41304	He	1122	“ Begonia , you tried to offer to write my mother a check for the dress you ’re wearing while simultaneously asking her not to cash it for two weeks until your next payday . You bought cheese from the clearance bin at the market this morning , and you promised Kristine we ’d use a dryer sheet when we wash this quilt before returning it to her tomorrow . When I say you would n’t understand , you have to trust that you truly could not possibly understand . It has nothing to do with your character or your intellect , and you ’ve done nothing wrong , but you can not understand . ”
41282	41303	41304	41304	He	1122	“ So people have taken advantage of you and your money your whole life , and you have trust issues ? ”
41308	41314	41304	41304	He	1122	“ Drop it , Begonia . ”
41315	41327	41328	41328	His	1122	“ Will you have sex with me if I drop it ? ”
41400	41405	41406	41406	I	83	“ Do n’t worry , ”
41409	41432	41406	41406	I	83	“ I ’m working on finding my self - respect so that I actually enjoy it when I finally have sex again . ”
42297	42300	42284	42284	Begonia	348	“ Insomnia ? ”
42407	42414	42415	42415	I	83	“ Do n’t come in here , ”
42418	42450	42415	42415	I	83	“ I ’m so sorry , sweetheart . I did n’t mean to startle you . Did you not get enough dinner ? The lobster was delicious . We missed you . ”
42455	42460	42415	42415	I	83	“ Do n’t start . ”
42461	42473	42527	42527	She	83	“ Hayes . We both know what you ’re doing here . ”
42474	42518	42415	42415	I	83	“ Removing myself from the public eye to mourn my cousin in private while I acclimate to my new position at Razzle Dazzle and take solace in the company of someone willing to let me be my own cranky self in the meantime ? ”
42519	42526	42527	42527	She	83	“ Is that what this is ? ”
42678	42688	42665	42666	a kid	1159	“ Do I get a say in my life ? ”
42689	42699	42665	42666	a kid	1159	“ Hayes . Of course you do . But … ”
42700	42716	42665	42666	a kid	1159	“ I ’m nearly forty years old . You do n’t get a but here . ”
42717	42724	42725	42725	I	83	“ You ’re dragging that girl — ”
42741	42744	42732	42732	I	83	“ Woman . ”
42745	42776	42665	42666	a kid	1159	“ You ’re dragging that woman into your life just to annoy everyone around you , when you know you could have your pick of so many more appropriate women . ”
42777	42787	42665	42666	a kid	1159	“ You ’re treading on dangerous ground , Mother . ”
42788	42887	42888	42888	I	83	“ She stopped and danced to the street performer music this afternoon , Hayes , and someone tipped her . Her dog attempted to steal a man ’s walker . She stopped at a tourist stand to ask for brochures about skydiving . Skydiving . She ’s flighty and unpredictable and completely ignorant of the ways of our world . Turn her loose with a reporter and god knows what she ’d say , and that egg thing this morning was horrific . Do n’t pretend it was n’t . The longer you string her along like this — ”
42931	42939	42914	42914	she	348	“ Did the dog return the walker ? ”
42940	42954	42914	42914	she	348	“ Yes , but Hayes . You know that ’s not the point . ”
42955	42960	42914	42914	she	348	“ Is n’t it ? ”
42961	42988	42989	42992	My last rebellion girlfriend	1162	“ The point is that she ’s just as terrible of a choice as your last rebellion girlfriend , and we all know how this ends . ”
43355	43481	43336	43337	my mother	348	“ You have two options , Mother . You can accept that I love Begonia and welcome her as one of the family , treat her with the same dignity and respect you ’d honor any other woman with , and stop attempting to sabotage our relationship behind her back , or you can leave . Now . I choose her . I realize you think you have my best intentions at heart , and I have no doubt you mean no harm , but I get to decide what I want . Not you . Not society . Not some arcane system of rules . And if you ca n’t respect that , then perhaps you are n’t what ’s best for me either . ”
43516	43521	43522	43522	she	169	“ Oh , dear , ”
43637	43640	43628	43628	I	83	“ Gone , ”
43646	43663	43641	43641	I	83	“ All of you . Before Begonia ’s out of bed in the morning . Understood ? ”
43664	43667	43628	43628	I	83	“ Hayes — ”
43668	43671	43641	43641	I	83	“ Understood ? ”
43703	43709	43710	43710	I	83	“ And handle that first , ”
43755	43758	43759	43759	She	348	“ Begonia ? ”
43830	43835	43836	43836	I	83	“ Where ’s Begonia ? ”
43994	44015	44016	44016	Her	348	“ You sh - sh - should g - g - go b - b - back in - inside . ”
44087	44093	44094	44094	She	348	“ Apologies . My mother — ”
44100	44109	44097	44097	I	83	“ Thank you for the sh - shirt . ”
44137	44149	44129	44129	her	348	“ But you ’re c - cold too . You should — ”
44150	44165	44166	44166	I	83	“ I prefer the chilly weather . It matches my cold , dead heart . ”
44202	44227	44194	44194	she	348	“ I divorced Chad because he did n’t defend me to his mother when she called me stupid and a waste of his intellect . ”
44239	44246	44228	44228	I	83	“ Seems her accusations were misplaced . ”
44247	44329	44330	44330	I	83	“ We were trying to have a baby , and she blamed me for us not getting pregnant too . The doctors said I was perfectly fine and healthy , but his sperm had motility issues , and she managed to twist that so that it was also my fault for not feeding him enough fruits and vegetables , and for nagging him until his swimmers went into hiding . He did n’t argue with her when she said that either . ”
44414	44421	44422	44422	My	83	“ I apologize for my mother . ”
44506	44524	44481	44481	she	83	“ Regardless of what she suspects we are , she was wrong to speak ill of you . ”
44525	44585	44481	44481	she	83	“ For two years , I waited for my husband to do what my fake boyfriend did in under two days . The man who ’s supposed to love me could n’t do for me what the man only pretending to love me would do to keep up the ruse . That ’s really pathetic , is n’t it ? ”
44586	44599	44600	44600	Christ	85	“ Love is n’t rational , but it ’s not pathetic either . ”
44652	44660	44661	44661	She	2503	“ Do you know the worst part ? ”
44676	44687	44668	44668	I	83	“ It bothers me that your story can get worse . ”
44688	44752	44753	44753	I	83	“ My mom did n’t understand . Does n’t understand . She thinks I should n’t have divorced him and that I should ask him to take me back because Begonia , he did n’t hit you , he provided for you , and he let you spend time with your friends . That ’s what my mom thinks a good relationship is . ”
44789	44804	44805	44805	I	83	“ And my mother wonders why I do n’t want to fall in love , ”
44808	44816	44805	44805	I	83	“ You would be good at it . ”
44817	44889	44890	44890	She	83	“ I grew up watching my family get richer and richer off of fantastical and over - romanticized depictions of relationships while every woman I was ever attracted to ultimately proved to want nothing more than my money , my connections , or my family name . I would not be good at love , because I have no idea what real love , in the real world , looks like . ”
44938	45023	44928	44930	Woody - boy	191	“ Real love looks a lot like changing your plans at the last minute to humor someone having an irrational panic attack , and then defending said flake to your mother , because you know no one ’s perfect , but you ’re willing to accept them just as they are , flaws and all , knowing that they ’re doing their very best , every day , and wanting to help them along that journey every day for the rest of your life . ”
45043	45053	45054	45054	Begonia	348	“ I know you wo n’t ever love me , ”
45057	45151	45054	45054	Begonia	348	“ I know this is pretend and temporary and just one more adventure for me , and something convenient for you . But I just want you to know , you know the right things to do to love someone . It ’s not your fault if all of the women in the world are n’t willing to do the same for you . It ’s actually a damn shame , because you would be quite a catch for any woman willing to see you for the man hiding under all those walls . ”
45219	45229	45215	45215	his	81	“ You do n’t know who I truly am , ”
45234	45271	45230	45230	I	83	“ I do n’t . You ’re right . But I know enough . And I do n’t blame you for not believing me . I probably would n’t believe me either if I were you . ”
46112	46124	46125	46125	he	2931	“ You keep saying you do n’t have cell signal here , ”
46128	46146	46147	46147	I	83	“ That was kind of the point of looking at this part of the country for vacation . ”
46165	46172	46147	46147	I	83	“ My mom ca n’t call . ”
46173	46182	46183	46183	He	2931	“ But you miss talking to your sister . ”
46190	46204	46183	46183	He	2931	“ You ’re on the wifi now . It ’ll carry a call . ”
46302	46313	46314	46314	he	2931	“ Do n’t listen to the messages from your mother , ”
46317	46364	46314	46314	he	2931	“ I would ’ve deleted them myself but your dog would n’t let me . Her emails too . Why the fuck is she still asking if you want to get back together with your ex - husband when she clearly knows you ’re dating me ? ”
46449	46497	46498	46498	Hayes	2931	“ If you hit that button , I will throw that thing into the ocean , your dog ’s opinion be damned . She does n’t believe you can keep me , and she thinks you need to cut your losses before you piss him off more . ”
46697	46719	46690	46690	You	1250	“ I ’m calling my sister and I ’m telling her you still have a few things to learn in bed , ”
46731	46738	46724	46724	I	83	“ I ’d expect nothing less . ”
47283	47286	47287	47287	I	83	“ Hey , ”
47320	47334	47335	47335	She	193	“ Oh my god , Begonia , you are a fucking ROCK STAR ! ”
47342	47378	47335	47335	She	193	“ No , Jerry , I wo n’t watch my language in front of the kids when my sister is dating a fucking billionaire . This is appropriate usage of the word fuck , okay ? ”
47379	47384	47385	47385	I	83	“ Hey , Jerry , ”
47390	47395	47396	47396	she	193	“ B says hey , ”
47406	47432	47400	47400	she	193	“ Talk . Now . Fast . Before Mom figures out we ’re talking and tries to beep in . She is losing her mind . ”
47433	47441	47442	47442	I	83	“ So this thing just kinda happened . ”
47479	47566	47400	47400	she	193	“ And I met his mom . And we ’re going to New York tomorrow . And you ca n’t tell the news that if they call , okay ? It ’s actually possibly scandalous that we ’re dating so soon after my divorce ? I do n’t know that part for sure , but it ’s like , the Rutherford family . Frowning wrong at a camera is scandalous , right ? And apparently there are security considerations with travel plans , blah blah blah . ”
47567	47598	47400	47400	she	193	“ Gossip Minute just posted a picture of you from dinner tonight and it looks like you ’re giving him the Heimlich . All I can say is , what ? ”
47599	47614	47615	47615	Her	1283	“ I told him the clay giraffe story while he was eating clam chowder . ”
47637	47659	47400	47400	she	193	“ Begonia . You ca n’t keep the world ’s last billionaire bachelor interested if you ’re trying to kill him ! ”
47660	47844	47400	47400	she	193	“ Hy . He survived . And you ca n’t tell me any of his other options for dinner companions would ’ve been nearly as entertaining . He ’s never dated a commoner before . Wait . No , he has , but none quite like me . He thinks the fact that I use drug store shampoo is adorable . Confounding , but adorable . Also , oh my god , he has this hundred - dollar - an - ounce hand cream from this spa called Silver Crocus , which is just the best name ever — wait , excuse me , it ’s Silver Crocus hand crème , spelled with that funky symbol over the first e , and I keep calling it cremm - aye just to watch him stare at me like I ’m one of those poison frogs that supposedly just went extinct , and yet he found me in the wild . Like , shocked and worried but still enthralled and like he ca n’t believe the very last poison frog in the world is his ? ”
47845	47854	47931	47931	she	1284	“ Only you , Begonia . Only you . ”
47855	47906	47400	47400	she	193	“ I do n’t have any expectations that this is forever — I mean , who marries their first boyfriend post - divorce ? Other than Mom , who loves being married?—so I ’m going to enjoy the thrill of the ride while I ’m on it , you know ? ”
47907	47918	47919	47919	she	1284	“ Is it … thrilling … in all the ways ? ”
47979	48003	48004	48004	Her	1284	“ The first time he kissed me , it was like , oh my god , is this what I ’ve been missing ? ”
48029	48041	48009	48009	she	1284	“ Shh ! I do n’t want to talk about it . ”
48095	48116	48078	48078	I	83	“ It ’s like … sometimes you just want to enjoy something without analyzing it too much , you know ? ”
48117	48125	48138	48138	She	1284	“ Analyzing is most of the fun . ”
48126	48137	48138	48138	She	1284	“ Do I need to talk to Jerry about that ? ”
48254	48259	48260	48260	she	2159	“ Enough about Jerry , ”
48321	48419	48420	48420	She	1291	“ Have you met Jonas yet ? Oh my god , I ’d probably ask if I could lick him if I ever met him . Yes , Jerry , you knew that when you married me . Hush . He ’s on my freebie list , not that it matters , because he ’s a Rutherford , and he ’s married now , which means he wo n’t let fans lick him anymore . Not that he ever did . But you can rest assured you ’re the last man I ’ll ever lick , okay ? ”
48443	48464	48438	48438	her	1291	“ Do you think he ’d let me lick him if we were in a dark room with no witnesses ? ”
48465	48470	48420	48420	She	1291	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
48471	48483	48438	48438	her	1291	“ Is Hayes as weird as the news says he is ? ”
48484	48539	48438	48438	her	1291	“ No . They just like to have something salacious to report , and he does n’t fit the mold is as juicy as it gets , which makes him an easier target than the rest of the family . He ’s such a nice guy , Hy . And — cone of silence ? ”
48540	48566	48438	48438	her	1291	“ I wo n’t say a word , unless it ’s to Mom , and only under extreme duress if it ’ll improve the situation . ”
48567	48583	48584	48585	My sister	2705	“ His mom does n’t like me , but he told her off for me . ”
48588	48598	48584	48585	My sister	2705	“ What the fuck ’s wrong with his mom ? ”
48599	48670	48671	48671	I	83	“ Oh , do n’t be like that . I ’m a suburban art teacher who ’s recently divorced , ca n’t cook , and does n’t know which fork to use during a seven - course meal , and he ’s the world ’s last eligible male billionaire . Of course she ’s concerned . I would be if I were her . And did you see my hair ? ”
48714	48801	48802	48802	I	83	“ His mother needs to know you ’re a fucking catch . Shut up , Jerry ! If you do n’t like my language , take the kids outside and play a damn game with them ! Sorry , B. He ’s taking the kids out now . As I was saying . His mother ’s had an awful lapse in judgment , and I ’m sure she ’ll see the error of her ways soon . So long as you do n’t cook for her . ”
48805	48814	48802	48802	I	83	“ Begonia . Tell me you did n’t . ”
48815	48874	48802	48802	I	83	“ I did n’t know I was meeting her and I got nervous and stayed nervous for the entire time she was here ! But it wo n’t happen again . At least Marshmallow did n’t do anything crazy like find a vibrator in her luggage and deliver it to my room . That would ’ve been awkward . ”
49004	49106	49000	49000	I	83	“ You should see this estate , Hy . It ’s on the southern tip of the island , so we can see both the sunrise and the sunset from the gardens , and Hayes rowed himself out here in a rowboat to get to me the day after Jonas ’s wedding , because he did n’t want to wait for a ferry , and that ’s hot . Here . Let me remember how to flip my camera , and I ’ll show you the sky here . The sunset is so gorgeous tonight . Pinks and blues and purples … ”
49135	49150	49000	49000	I	83	“ Tell me you do n’t have Giovanna Rutherford ’s vibrator in your possession . ”
49151	49224	49000	49000	I	83	“ No . It ’s back in the nightstand drawer in the guest bedroom , and you are not welcome here until it ’s reunited with its owner , and do you know what else ? Good for her . Now , can we please discuss how my boyfriend has the most delicious chest known to man ? You think Jonas is hot . You should see Hayes without his shirt on . ”
49225	49230	49000	49000	I	83	“ Hair or no ? ”
49231	49261	49000	49000	I	83	“ Yes . And it ’s like , not just a token amount of hair , but it ’s also not like a rug . It ’s just right . ”
49262	49268	49000	49000	I	83	“ Are his nipples even ? ”
49269	49299	49300	49300	She	1296	“ Will you never quit mocking my poor high school boyfriend and his crooked nipples ? That ’s how his body was made , Hy . Knock it off . ”
49305	49310	49300	49300	She	1296	“ And his … ? ”
49311	49344	49000	49000	I	83	“ Sorry , I actually had to sign a non - disclosure agreement about that part . It comes with dating a billionaire from the country ’s most famous family , apparently . ”
49345	49350	49000	49000	I	83	“ You did n’t . ”
49351	49401	49300	49300	She	1296	“ I did . And if I had a little more money in my vacation fund , I might ’ve hired my own attorney and asked him to sign one in return , agreeing to never mock my art or my cooking in the event that we break up . ”
49402	49441	49442	49442	I	83	“ Oh my god , Begonia . Only you . Fine . Tell me he ’s at least treating you to the rarest oysters and albino lobster and gold - crusted chocolates that will make your poop glitter . ”
49445	49532	49533	49533	She	83	“ No , but I think he would if I asked . But I do n’t want the fancy stuff . I like just having lunch or dinner with him out at the cute little local places with all the funny people who tell stories about the times they ’ve spotted him out here , or what they do in winter , or that time that a carton of lobsters spilled at the grocery store and they kept finding them in random places under the shelves . ”
49536	49559	49533	49533	She	83	“ And once again , only you . Are you really just hiding out in Maine with him for the next forever ? ”
49560	49578	49579	49579	She	83	“ No , he ’s taking me to Paris next weekend to see Monet ’s water lilies . ”
49582	49591	49592	49592	I	83	“ But you were saving up for that . ”
49598	49609	49592	49592	I	83	“ I ’ll find another dream to save up for . “
49642	49643	49629	49629	you	1297	” “
49646	49647	49629	49629	you	1297	” “
49711	49712	49706	49706	I	83	” “
49717	49773	49706	49706	I	83	” Hayes says behind me , startling me so badly that I drop the phone . When I recover it , all I can see is Hyacinth ’s textured ceiling , suggesting that she , too , has dropped her phone . Her face pops back into view , eyes wide , mouth gaping open . “
49782	49783	49784	49784	Your	83	” “
49789	49818	49819	49819	Hyacinth	83	” He sets a steaming mug on a small picnic table tucked in amongst the wildflowers , then drapes an arm around my shoulders and kisses my temple . “
49856	49873	49874	49874	You	83	” He lifts a hand and waves to my sister , then disappears behind me again . “
49880	49884	49874	49874	You	83	” Hyacinth whispers . “
49890	49895	49885	49885	You	83	” I whisper back . “
49919	50080	49914	49914	his	1301	” I nod , even though there will be no bone - jumping . Him moving into the other bedroom made that very clear . I manage to get off the phone without Hyacinth catching on that this is all just for show . But I ’m starting to wish my heart would remember that part . He made me tea . Chad never made me tea . And Hayes Rutherford is n’t my soulmate . But he ’s doing a damn good job of resetting my standards in the meantime . 17 Hayes Leaving Maine and returning to New York is inconvenient at best and a disaster - in - the - making at worst . We ’ve barely touched down in Albany before I ’m itchy for coastal air and lunch in a colorful lobster shack with townspeople who proved themselves nearly as adept at helping me maintain my privacy as my very well - trained security staff . “
50088	50110	49914	49914	his	1301	” Begonia has her nose pressed to the window of my private jet , peering out onto the small private airfield . “
50118	50148	49914	49914	his	1301	” It takes my head of security murmuring to her that we ’re not in the city , but rather upstate , for me to realize I was unclear . “
50178	50209	50166	50166	our	1305	” I tell her . She frowns . Marshmallow , who ’s in a bright purple vest and has been almost well - behaved the whole flight , also frowns . “
50229	50230	50166	50166	our	1305	” “
50233	50241	50166	50166	our	1305	” I rise and gather my coat . “
50272	50273	50264	50264	Nikolay	357	” “
50296	50297	50284	50284	I	83	” “
50338	50347	50351	50351	your	1310	” Her smile shines brighter than her hair . “
50354	50355	50351	50351	your	1310	” “
50384	50390	50351	50351	your	1310	” I nod to Nikolay . “
50403	50410	50413	50413	sir	1310	” The man ’s lips twitch . “
50415	50516	50413	50413	sir	1310	” I make a show of kissing her goodbye , which I enjoy more than I ’ll admit even to myself , before tucking her into the first of two limousines waiting at the edge of the taxiway . She ’s breathless , with pink staining her cheeks and her pupils fully dilated when I close the door myself . If my dick was n’t hard as a goddamn rock , I ’d be preening like a fucking peacock right now . I turn and open the door once again , lean in for a final kiss , and whisper , “
50543	50604	50539	50539	my	83	” She squeaks . I shut the limo door again , and I stride to the vehicle waiting behind it . When I slide into the rear seat , Razzle Dazzle ’s vice president of operations ’ executive assistant , Therese , crosses her legs beneath her pencil skirt and gives me a smile that sets my teeth on edge . “
50685	50686	50674	50675	Mr. Okimoto	203	” “
50742	50799	50803	50804	Mr. Rutherford	110	” She bites the end of her stylus and studies me for a long moment before dropping it back to her tablet and casually brushing her long hair back , pushing her breasts up as she does so . She ’s technically not my executive assistant , but that wo n’t stop me from issuing orders . “
50810	50811	50812	50812	I	83	” “
50824	50825	50826	50826	Her	81	” “
50833	50903	50830	50831	Mr. Rutherford	110	” I blink . I do n’t have Begonia ’s phone number . How the fuck do I not have Begonia ’s phone number ? I did n’t need it on the island , but I should ’ve thought — and I didn’t — and fuck . Robert , the second - in - command on my personal detail , visibly fights a smile as the car pulls away . “
50914	50915	50911	50912	Ms. Therese	202	” “
50921	51450	50919	50919	Robert	1310	” I do n’t speak to either of them the rest of the ride , instead burying myself in email on my work cell phone , nor do I acknowledge when my personal cell phone vibrates with an incoming contact card from Robert . Good man . He ’ll be finding a new bottle of his favorite brandy sitting on his doorstep this evening . Since my parents persuaded me to come work for Razzle Dazzle on the financial side of the business a few years after I finished my master ’s degree , I ’ve split my time between the New York and California offices , so walking into headquarters today should be nothing new . But it ’s the first time I ’ve walked in since my cousin Thomas passed unexpectedly , leaving the chief financial officer position vacant and me as the supposed best man for the job . Last week was spent communicating with the technical team , getting all the correct files unlocked and access granted , digging into active and upcoming issues , and having virtual meetings with various officers inside the company to get up to speed . Being back in the office now is the first time I ’ve had to bother with things like personal assistants , a schedule full of meetings with officers and executives , and sitting in a chair once occupied by a relative I wish I ’d spent more time with . We rarely saw each other outside the office , and with my former role as associate vice president of financial affairs for parks , real estate , and development keeping me nearly as busy as the CFO position kept him , we rarely saw each other inside the office either . It was a rare relationship that required little talking and less drama . While Keisha will forever be my favorite relative , I ’ve realized I did n’t know what I had with Thomas until he was gone . Also not helping ? Thomas ’s executive assistant is out on maternity leave and wo n’t be returning . The one modicum of peace I ’ve clung to after his death is knowing that he was able to see his daughter before the accident that claimed his life . While my family wo n’t publicly claim Mirabella or her mother as Rutherfords , they ’ll both be well cared for . And lest you think we ’re heartless bastards who put our reputations above all else , the decision is as much Thomas ’s secret girlfriend ’s as it is ours . She does n’t want to raise her daughter in the limelight that comes with being part of my family . God knows I understand that to my core . But it means that I need a new executive assistant , and when I leave my office at quarter to two , there ’s a wall of women crammed into my foyer who immediately leap to their feet . There ’s a damn wave going on in my office as if we ’re at a baseball game . I look at Therese . “
51458	51471	50919	50919	Robert	1310	” She lowers her cat’s - eye glasses and smiles at me . “
51493	51545	51480	51480	we	1326	” I look at the wall of women again , and I turn and retreat into my office . I do n’t want to pick an assistant . I want — Fuck . I want to not be here . I ’m dialing Begonia ’s number before I can think twice . “
51548	51549	51480	51480	we	1326	” “
51555	51556	51552	51552	I	83	” “
51604	51605	51582	51582	Nikolay	357	” “
51610	51614	51608	51608	people	386	” I interrupt . “
51623	51624	51619	51619	them	386	” “
51642	51649	51651	51651	I	83	” I can hear her blinking . “
51662	51666	51654	51654	I	83	” she whispers . “
51669	51680	51654	51654	I	83	” She growls . Begonia . Begonia growls at me . “
51690	51694	51654	51654	I	83	” I ask . “
51734	51735	51736	51736	I	83	” “
51742	51871	51736	51736	I	83	” Fuck me . That truly is the root of all of my problems . I spin in my chair and peer out my top - floor window at downtown Albany . I ca n’t see The Egg , which is apparently exactly where Begonia is right at this minute , but I know roughly where it is and I ca n’t stop staring in that direction , hoping the buildings between us will disappear so that I can see her waving at me and telling me I ’m being ridiculous . And she ’s right . Powerful men from rich families do n’t call the woman they found naked in their bathroom barely over a week ago and ask said woman to pick their new executive assistant . “
51878	51883	51872	51872	I	83	” I say slowly . “
52055	52056	52053	52053	I	83	” “
52104	52189	52095	52095	he	357	” she whispers . My heart squeezes . When it comes to people , I get very , very little right . With Begonia — I trust her . And if she fucks this up , I ’ll just fire whoever it is I hire on her advice , and I ’ll start over from scratch . With four applicants vetted by human resources , who will all be fired if they allow my waiting room to fill up like this again with applicants . “
52253	52254	52255	52255	Hayes	2931	” “
52273	52274	52255	52255	Hayes	2931	” “
52282	52330	52255	52255	Hayes	2931	” I ’m too old to crawl under my desk and hide , but I want to . And wanting to is a bad , bad sign . We should ’ve stayed in Maine . I could ’ve done everything remotely . I can still go back . “
52336	52341	52255	52255	Hayes	2931	” she asks softly . “
52344	52345	52255	52255	Hayes	2931	” “
52350	52351	52352	52352	I	83	” “
52357	52358	52352	52352	I	83	” “
52365	52366	52367	52367	Begonia	83	” “
52369	52370	52367	52367	Begonia	83	” “
52393	52394	52391	52391	you	2931	” “
52400	52401	52391	52391	you	2931	” “
52463	52464	52457	52457	I	83	” “
52467	52468	52457	52457	I	83	” “
52537	52560	52524	52525	your mother	348	” I freeze . She ’s fucking right . And if not my mother , someone in my family set this up . “
52567	52571	52524	52525	your mother	348	” Begonia orders . “
52575	52638	52639	52639	Begonia	83	” I stare harder in the direction of The Egg , and I picture Begonia straightening her spine and smearing on blood red lipstick — no , not blood red . Neon magenta . To match her hair . And while I do n’t feel very chief financial officer - ish in this exact moment , I find I can breathe again . “
52641	52642	52645	52645	Hayes	2931	” “
52647	52648	52649	52649	You	2931	” “
52662	52663	52664	52664	Someone	334	” “
52674	52682	52672	52672	they	334	” Yes . Yes , they did . “
52712	52760	52704	52704	I	83	” 18 Begonia I look at Hayes ’s square - jawed bodyguard as I disconnect my phone , and my face must be showing something , because his eyes start twinkling and he wipes a hand over his mouth like he ’s trying to hide a smile . “
52770	52775	52761	52762	Mr. Rutherford	110	” he tells me . “
52843	52844	52851	52852	Ms. Begonia	186	” “
52854	52906	52851	52852	Ms. Begonia	186	” My phone rings again as I start to follow him , and I ’m answering , assuming it ’s Hayes again , before my brain can process the name on the readout , and suddenly I ’m gaping at my phone in horror while my mother ’s voice rings out . “
52917	53042	52911	52911	Begonia	186	” Marshmallow whimpers , cowers to the ground , and covers his face with his paw . Nikolay mutters something to him in Russian , then jerks his head at me like he ’s saying , Come . The billionaire is waiting , and if you think your mother ’s terrifying , wait until you see Hayes Rutherford displeased . And now I ’m rolling my eyes . I ’ve seen Hayes angry , and I ’d rather relive that moment he found me in his bathroom seven thousand times over than take this call with my mother . But I ’m a grown - up , so I put the phone to my ear and reply to the woman I ’ve been avoiding . “
53047	53048	53045	53045	Mom	2159	” “
53059	53060	53049	53049	You	2159	” “
53104	53283	53284	53284	I	83	” Nikolay makes another noise , and I realize other people could overhear me and take me seriously . And then I ’d cause a scandal for Hayes , whose family is expected to model ideal , buttoned - up family perfection every waking minute of the day , and now I ’m mad . Why ca n’t they be allowed to be normal ? And have fuck - ups and scandals and regrets ? Why do they have to look like the epitome of perfection when perfection is n’t freaking possible and the pursuit of perfection only makes them miserable ? I mean , I assume there ’s a part of them that ’s miserable . Look at poor Hayes . It sounded like it cost him his entire bank account to tell me he trusts me . That ’s not normal , and it ’s not fair , and I hate it . Marshmallow whimpers and rubs his body against me while we march out of The Egg and to the car waiting on the street . “
53290	53295	53288	53288	Mom	2159	” I say loudly . “
53304	53395	53288	53288	Mom	2159	” Nikolay winces . I know , I know . I ’m not very convincing . I should n’t have been convincing when telling my mom I ’d be doing wicked , wicked things in public , but my temper is awful . At least , I feel like it ’s awful . Hyacinth laughs at me every time I tell her I had a temper tantrum . I ’m apparently not very good at them . I should put learn to have better temper tantrums on my bucket list . “
53401	53405	53288	53288	Mom	2159	” Mom asks . “
53420	53436	53288	53288	Mom	2159	” Nikolay opens the door to the limo , and I climb in after Marshmallow . “
53464	53471	53472	53473	His mother	726	” She sucks in a breath . “
53503	53504	53505	53505	I	83	” “
53511	53512	53513	53513	Begonia	83	” “
53547	53548	53549	53549	I	83	” “
53584	53617	53618	53619	Your father	1379	” The car pulls away from the curb , and I start to ask Nikolay if we can get some alcohol for me too , but then my mom ’s talking again . “
53669	53670	53652	53652	We	1378	” “
53681	53682	53652	53652	We	1378	” “
53711	53712	53713	53713	Marshmallow	84	” “
53756	53786	53787	53787	I	83	” My dog stares at me in horror , like he ca n’t believe I just threw him under the bus , while I hang up on my mother . “
53794	53830	53787	53787	I	83	” I hug him tight , holding my phone up on the other side of him to change my mother ’s ringtone so that I wo n’t make the mistake of answering without thinking again . “
53884	53893	53894	53894	She	1388	” Nikolay stares at me . I sigh . “
53937	53938	53923	53923	she	1388	” “
53944	53956	53923	53923	she	1388	” Dammit . That ’s not supposed to make me cry . “
53966	53971	53923	53923	she	1388	” He nods once . “
53984	53985	53986	53986	She	348	” “
53990	53995	53986	53986	She	348	” I insist again . “
54019	54053	54014	54014	she	348	” I ponder that on the rest of the drive to the Razzle Dazzle corporate offices , but the minute the complex comes into view , everything else fades out of my mind . “
54068	54072	54014	54014	she	348	” Nikolay nods . “
54085	54086	54014	54014	she	348	” “
54092	54093	54090	54090	Hayes	2931	” “
54105	54106	54101	54103	Mr. Gregory Rutherford	110	” “
54122	54123	54113	54113	He	110	” “
54139	54213	54113	54113	He	110	” The limo turns a corner , passing an adorable little bookshop and a tea house that both remind me of the streets of shops at Razzle Dazzle Village . All the buildings are three or four stories tall , so I assume the offices are above . I hope they ’re just as quaint on the inside . We turn another corner , and a stately gray brick building comes into view . “
54217	54224	54113	54113	He	110	” I guess . Nikolay nods . “
54230	54231	54232	54232	Hayes	2931	” “
54237	54532	54232	54232	Hayes	2931	” The limo glides to a stop at the steps to the fake City Hall building , and Hayes himself pushes through the glass doors to greet us . His hair is disheveled , like he ’s been running his fingers through it , and his square jaw is tight . So are his eyes . When I was little , I used to think Hyacinth and I would take over running the summer camp for Dad one day . But then the divorce happened , he declared bankruptcy , and he died , and the summer camp is no more . But I ’ve never wondered if I would ’ve realized it was n’t what I was supposed to do if Dad had n’t had to sell it . I ’ve always assumed I would ’ve happily taken over running the summer camp , but that it was n’t in the cards from the universe . And now I ’m wondering if Hayes was born to do great things not related to Razzle Dazzle Studios . Is he trapped ? Does he feel obligated ? Is he misreading the signs from the universe about other opportunities he has , or is he ignoring them , or is he just having a normal rough day because of upheaval in his family ? What would he do if he ’d been born like me , to ordinary parents in an average family just outside the suburbs , instead of into a world - famous family with ridiculously high standards set by the world around them ? He reaches the limo and pulls my door open before Nikolay makes his way around the car to do it , and then he ’s offering me a hand . “
54535	54536	54537	54537	Hayes	2931	” “
54539	54589	54590	54590	Everyone	755	” Our palms connect , and my stomach drops . In the good way , for the record . As soon as I ’m all the way out of the limo , he pulls me close , our bodies lining up while he presses his face into my hair . “
54604	54608	54590	54590	Everyone	755	” he murmurs . “
54622	54627	54628	54628	I	83	” I whisper back . “
54665	54666	54667	54667	I	83	” “
54692	54711	54683	54685	Razzle Dazzle Village	106	” He pulls back and stares at me like I ’ve grown a penis out of my forehead . “
54722	54735	54712	54712	We	1404	” I wince . I ’m so bad at asking for things . “
54750	54751	54748	54748	I	83	” “
54774	54782	54785	54785	Marshmallow	84	” Marshmallow growls and shoves between us . “
54787	54793	54785	54785	Marshmallow	84	” I rub his head . “
54845	54846	54854	54854	she	83	” “
54874	54875	54854	54854	she	83	” “
54891	54895	54885	54885	I	83	” I pause . “
54904	54905	54885	54885	I	83	” “
54908	54909	54885	54885	I	83	” “
54926	55047	54923	54923	I	83	” He visibly stifles an eye roll , takes my hand again and tugs me up the stairs , bypasses the metal detectors in the entryway that looks every bit as much like a government office would , almost like this is used on movie sets when they need city halls , growls at the lone guard in the building who looks at Marshmallow wrong , and then we ’re all crammed into an elevator together . It ’s a lovely elevator , but it ’s a little small for two large men , me , my dog , and the sudden knowledge that my fake billionaire boyfriend actually expects me to pick out a proper executive assistant for him . “
55057	55077	54923	54923	I	83	” I ask . He answers with a duh look . I wave a hand in his general direction . “
55088	55142	54923	54923	I	83	” I ask . Nikolay coughs and turns around , which does n’t do much good , considering the elevator walls are lined with mirrors . Mirrors etched with the Razzle Dazzle logo , but still mirrors . Hayes is spared from answering when the elevator stops and the doors open , and — “
55145	55149	55150	55150	I	83	” I whisper . “
55164	55223	55224	55224	Hayes	2931	” He kisses my forehead , looks at the throng of women squeezed into the waiting area , all of them rising to their feet or going up on tiptoe and peering at him , and he sighs so heavily I feel it in my toes . It ’s like he ’s on display at the meat market . “
55226	55272	55224	55224	Hayes	2931	” I whisper . His dark eyes meet mine , and I do n’t know if that ’s sadness or desperation or regret or hope , but I know whatever ’s going on in his brain and in his heart , it ’s not pretty . “
55284	55285	55224	55224	Hayes	2931	” “
55300	55301	55307	55307	Begonia	83	” “
55315	55316	55309	55309	I	83	” “
55324	55361	55309	55309	I	83	” He studies me for one more beat , and just when I think he ’s going to kiss me — please , please kiss me — instead , he turns to the room at large . “
55406	55419	55403	55403	I	83	” Murmurs and head - bobs affirm he ’s made his point . “
55425	55431	55403	55403	I	83	” I whisper to him . “
55441	55497	55432	55432	I	83	” He drops my hand and strides through the sea of women , leaving Nikolay , Marshmallow , and me to watch . And I realize I ’ve already decided at least four of the women wo n’t work out at all , because I do n’t like how they ’re looking at his ass . “
55508	55514	55502	55502	I	83	” Nikolay says to me . “
55534	55535	55529	55529	I	83	” “
55540	55544	55538	55538	people	386	” he replies . “
55586	55591	55592	55592	She	83	” My nose wrinkles . “
55598	55640	55641	55641	She	83	” I whisper , trying to subtly gesture to a white redhead in a killer mauve business suit who looks at Hayes wrong as he marches past her and into an office , where the door is quickly shut behind him . “
55667	55710	55661	55662	Mr. Rutherford	110	” Well . If that ’s not motivation to get started , I do n’t know what is . I clap my hands as if I ’m standing in a classroom , and the entire sea of women turns to face me . “
55740	55750	55734	55734	Nikolay	357	” He points to a hallway to the left . “
55755	55765	55734	55734	Nikolay	357	” I say , pointing in the same direction . “
55914	55939	55940	55940	You	1424	” No one so much as peeps — or moves — and I ’m starting to get funny looks . Nikolay clears his throat . “
55949	56274	55942	55943	Ms. Fairchild	111	” This will not be pretty . But Hayes is trusting me to help out , and this is just one more adventure I did n’t expect . Time to keep rolling with it . 19 Hayes I ’m hip - deep in first - quarter financial data , ignoring my ringing phones — yes , phones — and pulling my hair out over the post - it notes decorating the surface of my desk to remind me about who wants to meet with me when and about what for the next infinity . The lunch Begonia insisted Nikolay bring me tasted like sawdust , though I blame work rather than the food . I ’d rather be working on the data with the discrepancy in the real estate books , and I ’m about to surrender to the urge when someone knocks on my door . I ’m agitated that I ’m supposed to send this data to someone three levels below me for error resolution . I ’m agitated that my father ’s agitated with me for rescheduling a meeting with him . I ’m agitated that the vice president of corporate development has called six times to reiterate the same thing , as if I did n’t hear his request the first time , and that six other vice presidents have called with mundane greetings , congratulations and condolences , and small talk , and I ’m agitated that there are so damn many vice presidents and chairpeople in this damn company . In short , I ’m agitated , I feel ill - prepared to execute this job , which means I feel as though I ’m letting my family down despite the fact that I ’ve increased all of our fortunes tenfold with my instincts about the stock market and bitcoin and global currencies , and I ’m in no mood for one more person to demand my attention . “
56278	56315	56316	56318	Your executive assistants	1429	” I call to the knocker . The door swings open , and a very frazzled Begonia gives me the kind of look my mother sometimes gives my father when he ’s being a total twat . “
56323	56369	56370	56370	Assistant	1430	” She bends at the waist , sweeping her arm as if we ’re on a Broadway stage after performing a historical musical , and a warm glow spreads through my chest . But two women appear behind her , and there goes that glow . “
56372	56376	56370	56370	Assistant	1430	” I say . “
56379	56380	56381	56381	Assistants	1431	” “
56530	56556	56525	56526	Hayes Rutherford	2931	” She turns her back to me and points at the two people , one tall Black woman and one average - height white woman . “
56621	56622	56623	56623	Begonia	186	” “
56625	56632	56623	56623	Begonia	186	” She swings back to me . “
56642	56713	56623	56623	Begonia	186	” She ’s so very ruffled and tired yet still sparking with an undeniable Begonia energy that I find I ca n’t stop an unexpected smile . And honestly ? I ca n’t find fault with her logic . Razzle Dazzle ’s corporate offices do have room for improvement . I saw the surveys myself last week . Most executive assistants are doing far more than calendar and coffee management . “
56722	56769	56770	56770	Ladies	1061	” I rise and study the two women . Neither of them drops their gazes from my face , neither of them smiles , and neither of them winks or makes pouty lips at me . Dear god , I hate the pouty lips the worst . “
56813	56826	56827	56827	I	83	” Begonia puts her fists on her hips and glares at me . “
56834	56835	56827	56827	I	83	” “
56848	56877	56880	56880	ladies	1061	” My lips part , and an all - too - familiar sensation settles in my gut . Unfortunately , this time I know I ’ve earned it . “
56893	56958	56880	56880	ladies	1061	” I ’ll have to fire them both and start this whole process over again . They undoubtedly think I ’m easily pushed around , and I ca n’t do my job if I ’m having my assistants issuing me the orders . But I asked for Begonia ’s involvement . I should ’ve known this is what I ’d get . She sighs . “
57002	57015	56991	56991	I	83	” She nods to the white woman in a crisp blue suit . “
57042	57065	57035	57035	she	211	” And now she gestures to the Black woman who ’s wearing nearly the same ensemble as Merriweather , but in ivory . “
57130	57131	57125	57125	you	1453	” “
57142	57146	57139	57140	Mr. Rutherford	110	” Merriweather says . “
57166	57170	57163	57163	his	1456	” Winnie adds . “
57218	57219	57220	57220	You	1453	” “
57227	57231	57220	57220	You	1453	” I ask . “
57239	57240	57220	57220	You	1453	” “
57265	57315	57316	57316	Therese	202	” I tell myself the relief I feel is knowing that at least one of these two is machine - sexual and not at all attracted to me , but it ’s probably more that Begonia has potentially found competence among the personalities that she interviewed . Begonia beams . “
57432	57442	57456	57456	Merriweather	211	” Once again , I ’m smiling at Begonia . “
57468	57469	57458	57458	Winnie	89	” “
57483	57559	57479	57479	I	83	” She turns , hugs both of the women as if we ’re not in an office . I ’d correct her , but it ’s Begonia . This is how she operates . I saw her do the same thing nearly every time we left a restaurant in Sprightly and after our impromptu picnic on the beach . Corporate life does n’t match up with Begonia , and I would n’t want it to . “
57564	57660	57479	57479	I	83	” she calls to both women as they head for the doors , neither of them looking near as frazzled and tired as Begonia . But for the first time in my life , I find myself wondering if my potential employees are wearing masks , or if they truly have that much more stamina . It ’s difficult to out - stamina Begonia . As soon as they ’re out of my doorway , she pushes it closed , collapses on the sofa behind the door , and drapes her arm over her face . “
57700	57714	57695	57695	I	83	” There ’s a perfunctory knock , and Therese sticks her head in . “
57750	57764	57765	57765	He	1463	” How many times have I sighed today ? I ’ve lost track . “
57783	57787	57765	57765	He	1463	” Therese continues . “
57878	57888	57893	57893	Therese	202	” Begonia ’s lips curve up in a smile . “
57900	57901	57895	57895	You	1466	” “
57960	57961	57947	57958	four more qualified candidates if you ’d like to speak with them	1471	” “
57966	58006	57947	57958	four more qualified candidates if you ’d like to speak with them	1471	” Begonia answers for me . My phone rings , undoubtedly my mother calling to demand what in the hell I ’ve done with the company during my first day in the office . I ignore it and rise . “
58024	58025	58026	58026	I	83	” “
58036	58040	58041	58041	I	83	” Therese says . “
58049	58050	58051	58051	Rawr	213	” “
58053	58081	58051	58051	Rawr	213	” Begonia says . But she ’s barely gotten the sound out of her mouth before she bolts upright , miscalculates , and tumbles off the couch . “
58093	58094	58051	58051	Rawr	213	” “
58110	58128	58104	58104	We	1477	” She gapes at me while I pull her to her feet . Therese pats her shoulder . “
58145	58146	58139	58139	You	1479	” “
58154	58174	58139	58139	You	1479	” Begonia ’s voice has suddenly turned into the squeak of the mascot of Razzle Dazzle ’s largest competitor . “
58208	58231	58232	58232	You	1482	” I put a hand to the small of her back , oddly grateful to have her back within arms ’ length . “
58250	58251	58232	58232	You	1482	” “
58290	58322	58323	58323	Bird	214	” I open my mouth , and no words come out . Therese eyes me , then Begonia , and then quietly steps out of the office as Nikolay peeks in . “
58329	58330	58323	58323	Bird	214	” “
58375	58376	58367	58367	I	83	” “
58397	58398	58399	58399	He	1485	” “
58410	58667	58399	58399	He	1485	” Once more , my mouth is open , my lips are moving , and no sound comes out . Not because I doubt her . More because as I give it more thought , I ’m afraid she might be right . Opening an airplane door was beyond the dog ’s strength . A helicopter door might not be the same . Right now , the damn dog ’s trying to bite the trunk of a small tree in the corner as if either the tree is a chew toy , or he ’s decided his next career move will be interior decorator and the tree is in the wrong place . It could honestly be either option with that dog . Begonia ’s eyes go shiny . And that ’s how I find myself holding a hundred - pound beast in my lap , getting dog hair all over my suit and up my nose , making me wish Benadryl came in ironman strength as we make the flight from Razzle Dazzle headquarters to my estate farther south in the Hudson Valley . Nikolay guards one door . Robert is shielding my pilot should the dog attempt to climb out of my lap and help fly the damned chopper . Begonia ’s plastered to the other door . And Marshmallow keeps staring at me as though I ’m the bloody King of England , and he ’s my loyal court jester . This dog is going nowhere . He thinks I ’m his god . “
58673	58686	58687	58687	I	83	” Begonia says , one wary eye still trained on her beast . “
58745	58746	58740	58743	so many fascinating people	1490	” “
58763	58764	58765	58765	I	83	” “
58816	58858	58812	58812	You	1492	” My nose itches almost as bad as my throat , and my sinuses are beginning to clog , even with the daily allergy medicine regimen I started in Maine . But it ’s oddly tolerable . This might be gratitude . “
58874	58875	58869	58869	He	480	” “
58890	58902	58886	58887	your mom	2655	” This eyeball twitch has nothing to do with my allergies . “
58906	58907	58886	58887	your mom	2655	” “
58914	58920	58886	58887	your mom	2655	” I nod to her . “
58928	59037	58921	58921	You	1492	” She ’s sporting bags under her eyes , her bright hair is mussed in a way that makes me think she just crawled out of bed , and it ’s a good thing there ’s a very large dog blocking the view of my lap . And she still finds a smile for me . I rarely find a smile for anyone when I ’m hangry and exhausted . I rarely find a smile for anyone when I ’m not . Yet here she is , supposedly both , smiling as she turns to peer out the window . And , just as expected , she gasps . “
59046	59050	59040	59040	Hayes	2931	” she whispers . “
59060	59096	59040	59040	Hayes	2931	” To this point in my life , I ’ve avoided the corporate offices as much as possible , but I ’ve still made this journey often enough that I know what she ’s asking . “
59107	59108	59099	59099	I	83	” “
59118	59150	59111	59111	you	1492	” Nikolay ’s lips twitch . I try to glare at him , and instead , I sneeze all over the dog . Begonia turns away from the view , cringing . “
59175	59314	59172	59172	I	83	” Marshmallow does n’t look sorry . He looks like it ’s an honor to wear my snot . The damned dog ’s tongue is lolling out as he pants , looking for all the world like he ’s flirting with me the same as half the women and at least three men in the snack bar today . If they ’re not kissing my ass because they want to date me — and honestly , why anyone would want to date me is beyond me — then they ’re kissing my ass because I have power and money and connections . Not for the first time in the past few days , I wish I ’d been born into a family like Begonia ’s . My nose twists again , and Nikolay silently hands me a handkerchief . “
59325	59334	59172	59172	I	83	” Begonia ’s staring out the window again . “
59506	59612	59613	59613	I	83	” She spins , beaming at me , and her smile drops away . I have no idea what my face looks like , but I do know one thing . Begonia ’s just realized that the hotel she ’s gaping at is n’t a hotel . It ’s Sagewood House . And where every last one of my former girlfriends would ’ve fussed over its beauty , none would ’ve quite like Begonia . And none would be having second thoughts . It does n’t matter that I ’ve known her a little more than a week . I can see the second thoughts . “
59621	59625	59613	59613	I	83	” she squeaks . “
59633	59634	59631	59631	Begonia	83	” “
59693	59773	59774	59774	Begonia	83	” My first assignment for my new assistants will be to find Chad ’s address so that I can personally go beat the shit out of him . I ’m a damn Rutherford . We do n’t beat the shit out of anyone . We watch a fucking Razzle Dazzle film and hug . But I will beat the ever - loving shit out of Chad Douchecanoe Dixon for making Begonia feel inferior for merely being who she is . “
59776	59784	59785	59785	Begonia	83	” She does n’t look at me . “
59787	59796	59785	59785	Begonia	83	” I get a squinty - eyed cringe . “
59799	59800	59785	59785	Begonia	83	” “
59828	59835	59838	59838	I	83	” She flaps a hand about . “
59855	59856	59851	59851	I	83	” “
59866	59904	59857	59857	I	83	” Her eyes finally connect with mine , and it ’s like watching a puzzle click into place . She nods , and she probably has no idea just how regal that simple action is on her . “
59911	59912	59857	59857	I	83	” “
59933	60182	60184	60184	Begonia	83	” I ’ve said many , many things to Begonia that I never would ’ve said to another girlfriend . And I do n’t think it ’s the non - disclosure agreement and the fraudulent nature of our relationship insulating me from having to mean it , though I do mean it . I think it ’s that she ’s Begonia . 20 Begonia My fake boyfriend ’s house has a helipad and looks like a museum from the outside — and I assume on the inside too — and I ’m trying to embrace someday , I ’ll tell my great - nieces and nephews about the time I had an adventure pretending to date a billionaire and sleeping in his mansion , but I might be hitting overwhelm for one day . So when Nikolay opens the sixteen - foot - tall front door and gestures us into the marble - floored , crystal - chandeliered entryway after our short limo drive from the helipad to the circle drive and portico , and voices well up somewhere deeper in the house , beyond the curved staircase , I whimper . Hayes looks as exhausted as I feel . There are bags under his eyes that I wo n’t be pointing out , and his shoulders are drooping , which I also wo n’t be pointing out . But he pulls them back , glances in the direction of the voices , and then nods to Nikolay . “
60191	60192	60184	60184	Begonia	83	” “
60199	60205	60206	60206	I	83	” I whisper to Hayes . “
60221	60369	60370	60370	Hayes	2931	” I snicker - snort . It echoes in the massive foyer , and the sound of my own snicker - snort echoing makes me involuntarily do it again , until I ’m at risk of laughing until I ’m crying . Have I ever been this tired in my life ? If Hyacinth were here , she ’d tell me I ’d hit the dangerous side of slap - happy and needed a cheeseburger , a vodka chaser , and bed immediately . But Hyacinth is n’t here , which means I ’m leaning on Hayes ’s arm and trying to telegraph to him that that ’s exactly what I need when there ’s a squeal , then a flash of sparkly red , and the next thing I know , a literal rock star is shoving me out of the way and leaping on him . “
60376	60459	60372	60372	You	2931	” Keisha Kourtney is decked out in a red sequin bodysuit and cape , her platform red sequin boots hooked behind Hayes ’s back as she presses a resounding kiss to his cheek , which he tolerates with a level of affection that quite honestly pisses me off . Her short , jet - black hair is shaved on one side and dangles to her chin on the other , and sparkly diamond earrings lined with ruby chips dangle from her ears . “
60465	60484	60462	60463	a showboat	1522	” he tells her as he pulls her off of him and sets her back on her feet . “
60498	60656	60491	60491	you	2931	” She grins widely and turns to me , instantly smothering me in a massive hug . In her platform boots , she barely comes up to my chin . There ’s more superstar per square inch in this woman than should be possible , and I want to adore her for it , but I ca n’t quite get there , because she just jumped my boyfriend . An actual damn rock star . Molesting my boyfriend in front of me . My fake boyfriend , but she does n’t know that . And I feel like the sludge leftover in the pan after everyone else has eaten all of the grits — dried up and leftover and ready to be washed down the drain and put out of my misery — while her olive skin is glowing and her makeup is flawless and her eyes are bright and clear , unlike the rest of us . “
60730	60731	60732	60732	Begonia	83	” “
60740	60744	60745	60745	Keisha	453	” Hayes says . “
60768	60769	60770	60770	Cousin	219	” “
60772	60811	60812	60812	I	83	” I echo faintly . I ’m still getting squeezed to death by the tiny rock star . A rock star who ’s married , apparently . This is what I get for not reading the gossip pages . “
60818	60823	60812	60812	I	83	” Keisha whispers dramatically . “
60835	60844	60812	60812	I	83	” A smile plays at Hayes ’s lips . “
60859	60860	60848	60848	We	1528	” “
60865	60879	60880	60880	Hyacinth	83	” Keisha assures me , like she likes the idea of being scandalous . “
60885	60889	60880	60880	Hyacinth	83	” I blurt . “
60945	60946	60939	60939	Hyacinth	83	” “
60960	60967	60956	60958	you drama queen	1531	” an affectionate voice calls back . “
61003	61004	61005	61005	Keisha	453	” “
61007	61016	61005	61005	Keisha	453	” Hayes has pulled out the Boss Voice . “
61035	61036	61037	61037	He	1534	” “
61044	61050	61037	61037	He	1534	” Keisha whispers to me . “
61099	61100	61133	61133	Begonia	83	” “
61107	61120	61133	61133	Begonia	83	” Hayes murmurs to me . Keisha rolls her eyes at him . “
61162	61163	61158	61158	My	83	” “
61167	61179	61158	61158	My	83	” I say . She laughs , then beams at Hayes . “
61204	61205	61199	61199	She	1537	” “
61239	61274	61206	61206	Begonia	83	” Hayes nudges me to the stairs . Marshmallow sticks to his side . Nikolay gives me a hurry up look , and so I do . But first , I smile at Keisha . “
61282	61283	61206	61206	Begonia	83	” “
61296	61297	61290	61290	We	1541	” “
61302	61534	61300	61300	Hayes	2931	” Holy . Mother . Forking . Cannonballs . I have no idea who the woman swinging her hips as she strolls into the foyer is , but she owns this place . She ’s tall and slender , white , with thick chestnut hair , symmetrical features , bright green eyes , and her clothes fit her as though the entire reason pantsuits were invented was so that this woman could one day wear them . She ’s what you ’d get if Bella Hadid had a love child with Marilyn Monroe , except instead of being carried in a uterus , she was incubated inside the rarest rose and infused with the essence of phoenix wings and golden unicorn horns . And she ’s holding a hand out to Hayes as if she expects him to kiss it . He could have this , and I asked him to have sex with me purely for the sake of helping me get back in the saddle . No wonder he turned me down and has been avoiding talking to me about it ever since , except to kiss me when we have an audience to make it look like he wants to tear my clothes off . And despite knowing he does n’t actually want me , a very large , very angry green beast roars to life inside me . “
61537	61580	61581	61581	I	83	” I leap in front of him , take the goddess ’s hand — and yes , I have to reach about as high as my nose to grab it — and jerk it down to waist - level to pump it . “
61629	61665	61624	61624	we	1543	” The woman extracts her hand from mine and glares down at me with a look that could melt a diamond . Actually , I wonder if it has . Someone should call the scientists . “
61673	61677	61667	61667	you	83	” she demands . “
61722	61758	61716	61716	You	83	” This woman , however , will never be on my good list for implying that Angelina Jolie will get old . None of us are perfect , but Angie really is timeless to me . “
61761	61771	61759	61759	Begonia	83	” Hayes says gently , his voice slightly strangled , “
61805	61918	61799	61799	she	83	” Keisha has disappeared , but there are strangled noises coming from a nearby room that I ’d call muffled laughter if I wanted to take the time to analyze it , which I do n’t , because Hayes claiming me is making me feel warm and fuzzy and a little horny , despite the fact that I know it ’s for appearances only . I have yet to actually see Mildred . Nikolay is showing the first signs of discomfort I ’ve seen on him all day , and based on how his stomach sounded after lunch , I know it ’s not the first time he ’s actually been uncomfortable . “
61925	61935	61919	61919	Hayes	2931	” Liliane informs me . I clap my hands . “
62008	62088	62089	62089	We	1547	” Superman has nothing on this woman . I ’m pretty sure she ’s slicing and dicing my spleen with that look . And in the words of my dear sister after a particularly craptastic day , I have zero fucks left to give . Hayes is n’t a freaking piece of meat , and I ’d feel that way even if he had n’t threatened to sue me if I did n’t pretend to be his doting girlfriend . “
62094	62145	62089	62089	We	1547	” Hayes murmurs . She eyeballs me , makes a very obvious decision to not say whatever it is that would prove they ’re engaged — ha ! It ’s totally an our parents want us to get married thing , I knew it — and instead turns to Hayes . “
62156	62213	62146	62146	You	1550	” She gives me one last look , her attention lingering on my mid - section , though I have no idea if she ’s calling me chubby or if she ’s trying to determine if I ’m carrying his love child , before turning to sashay deeper into the house again , with a casual , “
62245	62254	62239	62239	you	1550	” tossed over her shoulder . Marshmallow growls . “
62257	62261	62239	62239	you	1550	” Hayes orders . “
62265	62293	62239	62239	you	1550	” Marshmallow harumphs , but he sits back on his haunches . These two . It is utterly unfair that Hayes is allergic . They ’re soulmates . “
62316	62322	62295	62295	you	1550	” I whisper to him . “
62329	62503	62295	62295	you	1550	” He puts a hand to the small of my back again and gives a gentle push , but unlike every other time he ’s steered me somewhere this past week , he keeps his hand on me as we make our way up the grand staircase . And I do mean grand . The stairs are marble . The banister is sleek polished wood , and the balusters are decorative cast iron , and the whole staircase sweeps a circle around the low - hanging crystal chandelier so that I can see that every bauble on the damn thing is free of dust as we reach the next floor . I ’m pretty sure a dust - free crystal — or diamond?—chandelier beneath an arched foyer ceiling is the ultimate sign of wealth . If I had one like that , I would n’t even notice it needed dusting until the light could n’t make it through the dirty crystals anymore , but there ’s no mistaking that this one is spotless . “
62521	62545	62295	62295	you	1550	” I ’m still whispering . I do n’t know if the walls have ears , or what the acoustics are like here . “
62552	62556	62295	62295	you	1550	” He pauses . “
62576	62584	62572	62572	he	404	” Nikolay coughs in the foyer below . “
62595	62671	62591	62591	her	1550	” Hayes murmurs to me before I can ask questions about this seagull aversion . He ’s on to me . There are very few people in this world that I dislike on sight , or who I ’m not motivated to win over on sight , and this Liliane person just got added to the very short list of two , with the collectiveness of Chad and his circle now being the other one . “
62677	62678	62679	62679	She	1550	” “
62694	62695	62679	62679	She	1550	” “
62710	63075	62679	62679	She	1550	” A full smile curves his lips . He barks out a laugh , and someone hand me a parachute . I ’m falling . I ’m falling hard , and fast , and it is a long way down . 21 Hayes Begonia is staring again . It should be annoying , but instead , it ’s making me examine every bit of my life with fresh eyes . Again . We ’re sitting before the wall - mounted fireplace in the den of my private suite , her lounging in a black silk robe and white terrycloth slippers from my closet , her hair once again wrapped in a towel , me in jeans and a Henley after both of us showered — separately , at her insistence , as though she was afraid I would suggest joining her , which I would ’ve done in a heartbeat if she looked any less worn down and unable to resist the charms of anyone with half the personality of a garden troll — and she ’s staring at the candlelit tray of food on the table between us the way I wish she ’d stare at me . I ’m reasonably certain it ’s not the black cloth napkins , the china , the crystal wine goblets , the candles , or the silver that have her captivated , her hand hovering above the serving tray piled with a dwindling supply of sliced roasted sirloin cap , thick asparagus spears , caramelized bananas , and cheese rolls . No , my question is which food is so enthralling that she ca n’t stop staring . I ’ve had this meal many times myself , but tonight , it ’s oddly more delicious . Probably because I ’m paying attention to the food instead of taking it for granted . I can honestly understand her fascination , and I do n’t believe I could pick a favorite . She does n’t leave me to wonder long , as she finally plucks a roll from the spread and holds it up to examine the soft puff of cheesy bread in the glow from the fireplace . “
63106	63107	63085	63086	the chef	1010	” “
63113	63117	63085	63086	the chef	1010	” I deadpan . “
63160	63208	63209	63209	I	83	” I jerk my head toward her , but she ’s already moved past the compliment , and she ’s sealing her lips around the cheese roll , moaning softly , and thinking is suddenly difficult . As is sitting still . And being in fucking jeans . “
63216	63310	63311	63311	I	83	” I announce . She inhales sharply , makes a noise that has both me and Marshmallow leaping to our feet , and then she ’s coughing . I hover while she coughs . And coughs . And coughs more , holding up a finger as if to say I ’m okay , this happens all the time , do n’t worry about it , which is exactly what Begonia would say if she could talk . I hand her my glass of wine , and she gulps it , then coughs again . “
63315	63344	63345	63345	I	83	” she rasps out . Naturally . Marshmallow has crawled into her lap and is head - butting her in the chest like the damn dog knows CPR . “
63349	63451	63345	63345	I	83	” she repeats . Her hoarse voice hits me right in the testicles and makes me ache . It shouldn’t — she could ’ve choked for real — but I ’m rapidly discovering there ’s little Begonia can do that I do n’t find attractive . Hence my incredibly awkward proposition . Billions of dollars in the bank , growing up in the most elite of societies , nannies and manners lessons and all but going to a damn finishing school , and here I am , being rendered awkward as a middle - schooler by a high school art teacher . “
63463	63482	63483	63483	She	83	” she says , a twinkle coming back to her bright eyes as she completely dodges the subject . “
63497	63644	63483	63483	She	83	” I ease back into my chair , afraid if I touch her , I wo n’t stop , and that was not the reaction of a woman wanting to take me up on my offer . Of course it is n’t . She has n’t said another damn word about having sex with me since she first brought it up , and I ’m nothing if not effective at shutting down passes . I ’ve had regrets before , but rejecting her might take top honors as the stupidest thing I ’ve ever done . And why would she want to have sex with me as anything other than a last resort of convenience ? Even at my best , I ’m a terrible option for her . And she ’s seen me not at my worst , but not anywhere near my best either . “
63651	63672	63647	63647	’ve	1562	” I offer , trying for a joke again . She does n’t laugh , but instead , nods thoughtfully . “
63831	63832	63839	63839	I	83	” “
63851	64000	63843	63844	Uncle Antonio	404	” I was counting on Uncle Antonio doing what he does best and telling everyone that he was headed to my house to take care of what the family says needs taking care of . Namely , getting me an appropriate wife . Otherwise , Begonia would ’ve taken one look at this house , realized seven families could live here without seeing one another for at least half a year , and ignored my request for her to stay in my bedroom . Having an ambush upon arrival ? She did n’t even question the size of the house . Merely the number of inhabitants and their likelihood to be nosy . As suspected . I am a bad , bad man , taking advantage of a woman who might not actually have a devious bone in her body , which , again , is highly suspicious . “
64021	64039	64017	64019	my executive assistant	1324	” I ask her . It ’s suddenly imperative to know . And Begonia does n’t disappoint . “
64067	64075	64052	64052	She	83	” I grimace . She does too . “
64082	64083	64052	64052	She	83	” “
64128	64181	64117	64117	I	83	” She ’s rubbing her chest as she leans back into the easy chair and stares at the fire , and I want to be her hand I want to be her hand , rubbing her chest . What has this woman done to me , and why do n’t I care ? “
64188	64195	64182	64182	I	83	” she says with a shrug . “
64200	64232	64233	64236	A chief financial officer	1589	” Ah . That ’s what she ’s done to me . She ’s been nice . My standards are awful . I should probably see the family physician about that . “
64250	64251	64254	64254	Hayes	348	” “
64299	64300	64302	64302	you	1587	” “
64304	64323	64302	64302	you	1587	” She gives me the do n’t sarcasm me when you know I have more to say look . “
64421	64435	64403	64403	Chad	91	” I hate Chad , and I want to punch him on principle . “
64444	64448	64403	64403	Chad	91	” She snorts . “
64467	64515	64517	64520	your ex - husband	3043	” I do n’t even know what Chad looks like , but I ’m picturing him bloody and missing a few teeth , with his arm in a sling and both legs in casts , and it ’s the only thing keeping my blood pressure in check . “
64556	64557	64558	64558	You	1600	” “
64598	64612	64588	64588	I	83	” She sighs in utter bliss as she bites into another cheese roll . “
64644	64645	64646	64646	I	83	” “
64665	64676	64646	64646	I	83	” She shifts in her chair , frowning at me . “
64765	64771	64758	64758	I	83	” She tilts her head . “
64812	64813	64814	64814	I	83	” “
64831	64857	64814	64814	I	83	” I need to shut up . I need to shut up , but she makes it so damn easy to admit to my fears . “
64864	64865	64858	64859	Your family	2554	” “
64876	64877	64866	64866	They	2554	” “
64983	64984	64985	64985	They	1615	” “
64996	64997	64998	64998	I	83	” “
65051	65052	65053	65053	You	1616	” “
65060	65061	65053	65053	You	1616	” “
65172	65284	65166	65166	They	525	” I snort . They should not trust my instincts . On investments and math ? Yes . On people issues and relationships ? No . Been there , done that , have the ex - girlfriend married to my mortal enemy to prove it . Begonia glares at me again as only Begonia can — in that special way that makes me feel like it ’s a glare - hug . There ’s no heat in it , no matter how much she tries , and I have every last ounce of her focus aimed at me , which should be uncomfortable but is n’t , because it ’s Begonia . “
65368	65369	65354	65354	you	1621	” “
65374	65375	65376	65376	I	83	” “
65384	65385	65379	65379	I	83	” “
65406	65507	65392	65392	you	1621	” I ca n’t let it go . Maybe I want her to tell me I ’m awful so that I ’ll quit being unexpectedly attracted to her . Maybe I want to find the chink in her armor so that I can prove to myself that she ’s not the goddess I ’m beginning to suspect she is . Or maybe I do n’t understand how one person can believe in so much goodness even after being married to a twatwaffle who clearly tried to destroy her spark . Whatever it is , I ca n’t let it go . “
65516	65520	65392	65392	you	1621	” I ask . “
65571	65572	65558	65559	Begonia Fairchild	348	” “
65575	65580	65558	65559	Begonia Fairchild	348	” she says quietly . “
65598	65659	65558	65559	Begonia Fairchild	348	” I ’ve spent my life serving my family in one way or another . And I know Razzle Dazzle ’s entire mission is to entertain people , and thus to also spread their own kind of joy . But I do n’t get it . I do n’t understand how so much giving can be anything but a drain . “
65666	65698	65699	65699	I	83	” She peers at me , squints one eyelid , then takes my wine and drains the last of my glass . I lift a brow . She tries to scowl . “
65713	65729	65730	65730	Heaven	233	” I ’m so startled that it takes me a moment to find a retort . “
65741	65776	65730	65730	Heaven	233	” No one makes her world better . Jesus . I need to make her world better . Someone needs to make her world better . She points at me with the wine glass . “
65807	65808	65810	65810	you	1633	” “
65813	65814	65810	65810	you	1633	” “
65859	65882	65852	65852	I	83	” If this is Begonia missing something in life , I ’ve been missing many , many somethings since I was born . “
65891	65892	65852	65852	I	83	” “
65920	65921	65913	65913	you	1633	” “
65926	65927	65913	65913	you	1633	” “
65941	65973	65937	65937	My	83	” I ca n’t decide if she ’s being serious or joking , but I want to smile , and it ’s difficult to keep my expression straight . She sighs . “
66113	66128	66129	66129	You	1642	” I reach behind the tray to the wine bucket and top her off . “
66150	66151	66157	66157	friends	815	” “
66159	66160	66157	66157	friends	815	” “
66163	66164	66157	66157	friends	815	” “
66174	66175	66157	66157	friends	815	” “
66212	66264	66204	66204	she	1644	” Those big eyes blink at me , surprise flashing across her face as she starts to point to herself , as if she ’s asking if I mean her . And the fact that I ’ve left her with any doubt makes me want to punch myself in the face . “
66269	66290	66204	66204	she	1644	” I order . Marshmallow leaps off Begonia ’s lap , sits at attention , and pants happily at me . “
66293	66326	66327	66327	I	83	” she starts , but she cuts herself off when I drop to my knees in front of her chair , grip her chin , and hold her face close to mine . “
66331	66332	66327	66327	I	83	” “
66345	66346	66349	66349	Begonia	348	” “
66355	66364	66351	66351	I	83	” Fuck . I ’m doing this wrong . “
66381	66400	66365	66365	You	83	” Her eyebrows do a weird little jig over her eyes , and fuck again . I growl . “
66427	66852	66853	66853	Hayes	348	” Fuck the words . Fuck talking . I need to kiss her . I need to kiss her , and touch her , and taste her , and show her . Our relationship ? Outside these doors , it ’s pretend . It ’s fake . But when I ’m with her ? When I ’m with her , it feels so very , very real . And I want it to be real . I want to trust this . I want to trust her . I want to believe people like Begonia truly exist in the world , and that this is n’t a cruel hoax , that she wo n’t move on to shagging my neighbor or the next executive or artist or snake oil salesman who makes her feel wanted more than I do whenever she ’s gotten what she wants out of this . But even if my trust is misplaced , she ’s still done enough for me that I want to give her something in return . She does n’t resist when I touch my lips to hers . No , not Begonia . She leans into me , welcoming my touch , my kiss , me . I know she makes everyone feel this glow , this peace , this sense of happiness just by being near her — it ’s not something she ’s doing just for me — but god , it ’s a high I ca n’t get enough of . She fists my shirt in her hands and holds on as though she ’s afraid I ’ll stop . I do n’t know if she wants me or if she ’d take anyone , but I know I want to be the one to give her what she wants . And I wo n’t ask myself if she ’s thinking of someone else while she ’s kissing me . If she ’d respond like this for anyone who kissed her when she wanted a kiss . What the fuck was her ex - husband thinking , letting go of a woman who can kiss like this , who can make a man feel alive like this , who puts all of herself into everything she does ? Of all the women I could ’ve found in my private sanctuary last week , thank god it was Begonia . She breaks free of the kiss with a soft whimper , her gaze falling to her lap , hands still clenching my shirt . “
66861	66862	66853	66853	Hayes	348	” “
66868	66903	66906	66906	I	83	” The towel has fallen off her hair and her robe is gaping open , giving me a glimpse of the curve of her full breasts , rising and falling with her rapid breath . “
66909	66913	66906	66906	I	83	” she whispers . “
66940	67000	66938	66938	Me	83	” Those gorgeous eyes connect with mine , and it kills me that I ca n’t read people the way she can . Does that nod mean yes , I want you , or does that nod mean yes , I want you because you ’re convenient and I want people who want me ? Do I fucking care ? “
67014	67018	67008	67008	I	83	” I murmur . “
67047	67063	67064	67064	You	404	” Her gaze does n’t waver , though her lips tip up at the corners . “
67068	67069	67070	67070	I	83	” “
67074	67075	67076	67076	I	83	” “
67081	67082	67076	67076	I	83	” “
67096	67115	67093	67093	you	404	” She studies me , her eyes flickering over my face as her fingers thread into my hair . “
67118	67309	67093	67093	you	404	” she whispers . And then she ’s kissing me , slow and cautious turning into desperate and reckless , and I ’m wearing too many damn clothes . She nips at my lower lip . I untie her robe and let my hands explore the smooth skin around her ribs . She fists my hair and holds me tighter while she devours my mouth , her eager little tongue hot and slick and perfect , those whimpery moans in the back of her throat making me hard as steel . It ’s been a long time since I ’ve kissed a woman I was this attracted to , and there ’s a whisper in the back of my brain that I ca n’t shut off . You do n’t know her . Can you truly trust her ? I tell it to fuck off as her legs wrap around my middle , tugging me closer . This was n’t in the contract . I growl and cup her breasts , finding the tight nubs of her nipples with my thumbs , and she breaks the kiss with a gasp . “
67321	67322	67093	67093	you	404	” “
67330	67331	67093	67093	you	404	” “
67336	67348	67093	67093	you	404	” I bend and suck one sweet nipple into my mouth . “
67351	67375	67093	67093	you	404	” she moans . Her head drops back , and she tightens her legs around me while she holds me to her chest . “
67380	67580	67093	67093	you	404	” The dog tries to nose in , and I shove him away with my elbow . The scent of her arousal hits me and makes my mouth water . If she ’s faking — no . Not Begonia . And even if she is , I ’ll make certain she ’s not for long . I lick the underside of her breast , and when she squirms and writhes with that panting , breathy yes yes yes , I repeat it for the other breast . I suckle and lick and tease , worshipping her breasts and telling all of my internal doubts to go to hell , her gasps and moans the soundtrack that I want playing on repeat every night for the rest of my life . My family name , my heritage , my bank account , my job — they make me powerful by default , and they ’re nothing I ’ve earned on my own . Begonia ’s reaction to my touch makes me feel like a fucking god . And that is all me . The dog nudges me again . I nudge him right back . Not hard , but firm . “
67585	67724	67583	67583	Hayes	348	” she gasps , and that ’s all it takes for me to sink back into the moment . I do n’t know what the please is for , but I know her robe has fallen off her shoulders , leaving her bare from neck to toes , her skin bathed in candlelight , lips parted , eyes dark and hungry , hair loose and wild , and I want this woman . I want her in my bed . I want her in my shower . I want her in my office . I want her in my limo . In my helicopter . On my boat . And I want to deserve her . My lips slide down her sternum , kissing and licking lower , over her belly , until I reach her exposed pussy . “
67727	67740	67583	67583	Hayes	348	” she moans when I lick at the wetness between her legs . “
67745	67746	67747	67747	You	1650	” “
67751	67772	67747	67747	You	1650	” I murmur against her exposed flesh . Her body trembles , and she tilts her hips into my mouth . “
67776	67781	67747	67747	You	1650	” I lick her . “
67789	67790	67747	67747	You	1650	” “
67795	68055	68060	68060	Hayes	348	” I twirl my tongue around her clit , and she does n’t reply . Not with words , that is . But her high - pitched moan of approval tells me everything I need to know . For all that I got wrong today , this , I ’m doing right , and so I lick and tease her again , inhaling her scent , tasting her , pleasing her . She ’s not quiet as I devour her pussy , nor is she still , and I love it . Mind your manners , Hayes . A Rutherford is circumspect . Fuck that too . I want her screaming my name . I want the whole damn household to know she ’s satisfied . No , not satisfied . Mindlessly , bonelessly , wholly sated . My cock aches . My balls ache . She ’s delicious , and she ’s writhing in her chair , head back , arms flinging about until she settles with one hand gripping my hair , the other pinching her own nipple as she rides my face and I eat her like I ’ve never eaten another woman in my life . I want her to come . I want her to come all over my face , and then all over my dick . I want to watch her fall dead asleep in that coma that comes after a good , hard fuck , then feel her reach for me in the middle of the night , hungry for more . “
68065	68107	68108	68109	Good boy	2537	” Her words are cut off by the splintering shriek of the smoke alarm . I register the bitter taste of smoke , sense heat , and then — And then my sprinkler system explodes all over my bedroom . 22 Begonia “
68111	68263	68108	68109	Good boy	2537	” I say to Marshmallow once again . He harumphs and sits at my feet , looking away from me like he ’s pissed . Understandable . He tried to tell us a couple times that I ’d knocked the candle over , and we ignored him , because oh my god , Hayes Rutherford is a vagina - worshipping king , which I should not be thinking about while he ’s inside the house with the fire marshal and I ’m out here on the fanciest patio I ’ve ever seen in my life — no , it ’s a courtyard , not a patio — chilling in the rapidly cooling evening with sex - hair and a singed silk robe and a pouting dog and , you know , the rest of his entire family , who are all dressed and who all know exactly what we were doing . “
68270	68275	68276	68276	I	83	” Keisha asks me . “
68309	68310	68311	68313	One or two	1654	” “
68315	68320	68311	68313	One or two	1654	” I tell her . “
68326	68583	68311	68313	One or two	1654	” We stare at each other for half a beat , and then Keisha cracks up . I was interrupted in the beginning of what promised to be the best orgasm of my life , and I ruined what was left of the cheese rolls in the fire and subsequent dousing from sprinkler water that had clearly been in those pipes for years , based on the smell of me , Marshmallow , and my robe , and so even though jokes about hard penises would be funny in other circumstances , I barely manage a smile . Liliane Sussex - Williams makes a delicate huff of disapproval . Marshmallow gives me the stink eye . Giovanna Rutherford sighs heavily . And two gentlemen I have n’t met yet cross the courtyard toward the large brick fireplace that Millie ’s lighting for us . One is unmistakably Hayes ’s father — they have the same gait , the same eyes , and the same twist of their mouths when they ’re irritated , plus , he ’s Gregory Freaking Rutherford , president and CEO of Razzle Dazzle , so of course I know who he is , even if I do n’t read the gossip pages — and the other man must be the legendary Uncle Antonio . I do n’t know if he ’s legendary to anyone else , but he ’s Keisha ’s father , and I know he ’s the instigator of today ’s house party , so he ’s legendary to me . “
68586	68597	68311	68313	One or two	1654	” Uncle Antonio wins the race to reach me first . “
68674	68675	68680	68680	Antonio	404	” “
68682	68706	68680	68680	Antonio	404	” Gregory Rutherford murmurs . He glances at me , then at his wife , then back to me , before addressing Millie . “
68719	68720	68711	68711	you	1662	” “
68723	68727	68728	68728	I	83	” Millie replies . “
68746	68750	68751	68751	I	83	” Marshmallow harumphs . “
68755	68760	68761	68761	I	83	” I tell them . “
68778	68868	68761	68761	I	83	” Everyone on the patio looks at me sideways . And thank god , Hayes steps out of the house just then . His hair still has all the evidence of me gripping it like my life depended on that orgasm he was working on giving me , and I do n’t know if he ’s walking stiffly because he ’s uncomfortable in the jeans or because this entire situation is uncomfortable , or maybe it ’s both , or neither . Everyone ’s attention swings back to him . “
68874	68875	68761	68761	I	83	” “
68881	68882	68761	68761	I	83	” “
68889	68890	68761	68761	I	83	” “
68909	68929	68986	68986	Begonia	348	” Keisha ’s question comes with a grin that I take to mean she ’s looking for a reaction . “
68935	68941	68986	68986	Begonia	348	” Liliane says to her . “
68947	68948	68986	68986	Begonia	348	” “
68975	68981	68986	68986	Begonia	348	” Hayes takes my hand . “
68988	69031	68986	68986	Begonia	348	” I lift my hand to wave and parrot a Good night , Begonia to Hayes ’s family , because I ’m that level of weird and awkward , when Marshmallow growls low in his throat . A split second later , the “
69035	69050	69051	69052	Your mother	348	” rings from Hayes ’s butt . He squeezes his eyes shut and sighs . “
69054	69058	69051	69052	Your mother	348	” he guesses . “
69064	69068	69051	69052	Your mother	348	” I squeak . “
69088	69098	69086	69086	you	1665	” Marshmallow growls harder and stalks Hayes ’s ass . “
69105	69144	69145	69145	Marshmallow	84	” Hayes pulls out my phone , with its sparkly purple case , glances at me , and once again , Marshmallow does what he does best . He steals the phone and darts off into the night . “
69147	69148	69145	69145	Marshmallow	84	” “
69159	69163	69164	69164	He	84	” Giovanna says . “
69185	69194	69164	69164	He	84	” Hayes answers . He whistles , and the “
69198	69210	69164	69164	He	84	” gets louder , like Marshmallow is actually returning to us . “
69218	69224	69225	69227	Ex - husband	1671	” he says to me . “
69229	69265	69225	69227	Ex - husband	1671	” I whisper . He stares at me for a beat , the piece still humming along on my phone , before his lips quirk up in an unexpected smile that takes my breath away . “
69269	69270	69271	69271	I	83	” “
69288	69327	69275	69275	I	83	” Marshmallow trots back onto the lit patio , phone clenched in his jaw , murder written in his eyes . He and Chad met once or twice . It did n’t go well for either of them . “
69335	69377	69378	69378	Marshmallow	84	” I order . He ignores me and approaches Hayes instead , growling low . Hayes snaps his fingers and holds his hand out . Marshmallow growls again . The phone stops ringing , and I breathe a sigh of relief . “
69385	69396	69378	69378	Marshmallow	84	” Hayes orders . Marshmallow drops it at his feet . “
69404	69408	69378	69378	Marshmallow	84	” Keisha whispers . “
69417	69421	69422	69422	Liliane	225	” Liliane murmurs . “
69429	69434	69422	69422	Liliane	225	” Hayes adds as the “
69438	69446	69449	69450	your parents	2484	” starts playing again on my phone . “
69467	69492	69449	69450	your parents	2484	” Marshmallow growls . I lunge for the phone . And Hayes holds it out of my reach as he swipes to answer it . “
69497	69501	69502	69502	Begonia	348	” I gasp . “
69510	69525	69502	69502	Begonia	348	” my ex - husband ’s nasal , annoying voice says over the speaker . “
69605	69606	69602	69602	I	83	” “
69620	69624	69602	69602	I	83	” Hayes interrupts . “
69643	69656	69637	69637	she	225	” Chad sucks in an audible breath that carries across the patio . “
69664	69680	69681	69681	Your	225	” Hayes points to my dog , who ’s baring his teeth at the phone . “
69697	69709	69710	69711	Good boy	2537	” The bared teeth turn into a hair - raising growl . “
69713	69720	69710	69711	Good boy	2537	” Hayes hangs up the phone . “
69724	69742	69710	69711	Good boy	2537	” Marshmallow plops back on his haunches , happy as my stepfather in a pool of bacon . “
69753	69759	69710	69711	Good boy	2537	” Keisha whispers to Millie . “
69777	69784	69770	69770	I	83	” Hayes grabs my hand again . “
69794	69812	69792	69792	Begonia	348	” This time , we make it into the house without interruption , with Marshmallow trotting along . “
69818	69823	69814	69814	you	2537	” Hayes asks me . “
69844	69857	69858	69858	We	1678	” He steers me through the kitchen to a stairwell leading downstairs . “
69880	69888	69871	69871	we	1678	” I almost trip on the stairs . “
69895	69896	69897	69897	We	1678	” “
69953	70055	70056	70056	Begonia	348	” I stare at him . Does he want to get engaged because he likes me , or is this all part of the ruse ? I do n’t want to get married again . Not for real . I ’m still finding me . This is an adventure on that path , not the end goal . And the sex — yes , please , but also , did he do it for me because I asked him to , or because he likes me ? I know he likes me . We ’re friends . With hopefully more benefits . “
70058	70059	70056	70056	Begonia	348	” “
70069	70070	70056	70056	Begonia	348	” “
70073	70074	70056	70056	Begonia	348	” “
70083	70263	70077	70077	I	83	” 23 Begonia Headache ? Check . Mouth that tastes like my grandmother ’s wedding dress freshly out of storage with the mothballs ? Check . Stomach angrier than an arena full of Copper Valley Thrusters fans when that ref made that terribly wrong slashing call against Ares Berger and nearly cost the team the championship ? Check . Missing fake boyfriend who wants to do paperwork to extend our agreement to include a fake engagement after I interrupted him eating me out by setting a tablecloth on fire ? Check . His distrustful mother sitting across from me at the formal dining room table first thing on a Tuesday morning after he also left me a note that we ’re committed to a charity gala in New York City later this week and I have to go shopping for a dress that will involve Slimzies , borrowed jewels that I will hopefully not lose , and plastering my face with more makeup than The Blue Man Group require in a week ? Check , check , and check . “
70272	70298	70077	70077	I	83	” Giovanna says , as if I did n’t attempt to burn the house down last night while her son was going down on me . “
70309	70310	70311	70311	I	83	” “
70329	70330	70331	70332	Poor dear	1683	” “
70354	70381	70385	70385	you	1683	” I will never again believe any interviews that paint Giovanna Rutherford as a saint of a mother . Yogurt on a hangover stomach ? Gross . “
70401	70420	70385	70385	you	1683	” Oof . I ’m catty . Not a good sign . I force a smile and continue . “
70460	70461	70455	70455	she	1688	” “
70473	70474	70471	70471	Begonia	348	” “
70496	70761	70482	70482	You	1683	” She does n’t take the bait . Out loud , anyway . Her smile behind her coffee cup says the no , I do n’t , because there are n’t many people odder than you that she ’s stifling . Or possibly I ’m reading too much into this because I ’m tired and my head hurts and I could really , really use a spill - my - guts visit with Hyacinth . Or a Big Mac . Definitely a Big Mac . I do my best to smile at Hayes ’s mother like I mean it , and not like I ’m hoping Liliane Sussex - Williams is gone and Uncle Antonio and his family are gone and that Giovanna is heading somewhere else today so Marshmallow and I can run around the grounds — or so he can while I flop in the grass and bake in the sunshine — and contemplate where I should go next week when my contract with Hayes is up if he comes to his senses and does n’t continue asking me to extend it . And maybe also contemplate how I ’ll try to not be sad when I have to go , and how maybe we ’ll stay friends and I can text him now and again , even though I know he ’ll be too busy for me . I ca n’t stay here . That much is clear . And not because Giovanna Rutherford does n’t like me , but because I like Hayes . I like him entirely too much . “
70770	70789	70762	70762	I	83	” I say to her , knowing full well she wo n’t be sorry to see me go , “
70800	70801	70805	70805	dear	83	” “
70813	70879	70807	70807	I	83	” I look down to tell Marshmallow to come along , but he ’s not there . Giovanna makes a strangled noise . And there he is , walking into the formal dining room with a colander on his head and a tall salt shaker clenched in his jaw , tipping it so that he leaves a trail of salt behind him . I cringe . “
70887	70892	70883	70883	Marshmallow	84	” I say apologetically . “
70899	70900	70901	70902	The housekeeper	1691	” “
70909	70933	70901	70902	The housekeeper	1691	” I give my dog the stink - eye . He gives it right back . I think he ’ll miss Hayes too . “
70945	71100	71101	71101	Hi	245	” We head to the kitchen , which is easy to find — you just follow the trail of salt — and when I get there , I ’m hesitant to walk in . It ’s massive . And fancy . The kitchen has an arched ceiling . At least two ovens . Three sinks . A backsplash that was probably hand - painted by one of the Italian greats who was re - animated with some of the Rutherford fortune . Money can buy anything , right ? It takes me a minute to spot the refrigerator because the facing blends in with the cabinets . The island is the size of a continent . The kitchen itself is larger than my entire apartment . And the chef is slicing and dicing things on a cutting board and does n’t look happy at the interruption . You only live once though , right ? “
71103	71130	71101	71101	Hi	245	” I smile and wave like we ’re not standing ten feet apart . Actually , it might be twenty . This is a massive kitchen . “
71160	71164	71165	71165	Child	246	” She snorts . “
71169	71178	71179	71179	They	1695	” she says in a thick French accent . “
71189	71211	71185	71185	they	1695	” I smile again , which makes my temple throb . She does n’t . Maybe her temple ’s throbbing too . “
71430	71458	71463	71463	him	441	” She finishes with six carrots , sets her knife down , and gives me a look that would probably put Giovanna Rutherford herself in her place . “
71465	71466	71467	71468	His mother	726	” “
71484	71485	71478	71478	he	441	” “
71497	71534	71486	71486	Men	422	” She snorts , and I swear she ’s snorting in a French accent too . Then she points to the other side of her work island , where six stools are lined beneath the countertop . “
71550	71551	71552	71552	Hayes	348	” “
71559	71563	71564	71565	Wise man	441	” I whisper . “
71579	71580	71567	71567	I	83	” “
71589	71590	71581	71581	He	441	” “
71601	71621	71581	71581	He	441	” She smiles . Not gon na lie — I’m fairly certain it ’s a smile meant to terrify . “
71629	71630	71623	71623	you	1704	” “
71643	71647	71634	71635	Mr. Rutherford	110	” She winks . “
71673	71674	71669	71669	You	1704	” “
71683	71700	71679	71679	I	83	” She points to a large stainless steel machine on a counter along one stone wall . “
71712	71718	71706	71706	I	83	” I almost tear up . “
71722	71723	71706	71706	I	83	” “
71730	71754	71706	71706	I	83	” I laugh , thoroughly enjoying the sound of her voice . It ’s like taking a trip without having to go anywhere . “
71757	71758	71759	71759	I	83	” “
71790	71791	71785	71788	Ms. Sussex - Williams	247	” “
71796	71800	71785	71788	Ms. Sussex - Williams	247	” I whisper . “
71811	71812	71808	71808	your	1704	” “
71819	71884	71817	71817	Begonia	348	” Keisha says . Her hair is wild , like she had a very good night . She ’s in a bright pink kimono , which is gaping open to her belly button and matches the silk pants that are threatening to fall off her tiny frame . She pauses halfway to the coffee maker and dusts off her bare feet with a frown . “
71900	71901	71891	71891	she	348	” “
71908	71915	71916	71916	I	83	” Françoise murmurs . Keisha grins . “
71974	71978	71967	71968	The dog	912	” I nod . “
71994	71995	71988	71988	I	83	” “
71998	72002	71988	71988	I	83	” She laughs . “
72065	72066	72057	72057	I	83	” “
72071	72072	72075	72076	the housekeeper	1691	” “
72096	72097	72132	72132	Liliane	225	” “
72100	72104	72132	72132	Liliane	225	” Françoise agrees . “
72110	72111	72132	72132	Liliane	225	” “
72120	72131	72132	72132	Liliane	225	” Keisha says . She affects a French accent herself . “
72140	72164	72167	72167	she	225	” Françoise ’s nose twitches , and I do n’t know if she ’s amused or if she ’s plotting Keisha ’s demise . “
72170	72178	72167	72167	she	225	“ Have coffee . Spill the kidneys . ”
72179	72184	72185	72185	Keisha	453	“ She means beans , ”
72190	72196	72185	72185	Keisha	453	“ I prefer the kidneys . ”
72268	72280	72281	72281	Keisha	453	“ So are you real , or are you the shield ? ”
72312	72321	72299	72299	I	83	“ Oh my god . What is this ? ”
72322	72349	72380	72380	Savor	251	“ Properly fresh - roasted and fresh - ground Guatemalan beans , though you might ’ve ruined it with all that sugar and cream and cinnamon . ”
72350	72364	72299	72299	I	83	“ That machine literally fresh - roasts and fresh - grinds the beans ? ”
72365	72375	72376	72376	I	83	“ That ’s what all the noise was , B. ”
72423	72436	72418	72418	she	83	“ You did n’t answer the question . Real or a shield ? ”
72446	72463	72464	72464	She	83	“ Do any of us ever know what ’s going on in a man ’s mind ? ”
72467	72472	72464	72464	She	83	“ Excellent avoidance tactic . ”
72473	72478	72418	72418	she	83	“ I like him . ”
72493	72501	72418	72418	she	83	“ But he ’s so … guarded . ”
72502	72517	72518	72518	I	83	“ You would be too if the love of your life married your nemesis . ”
72525	72531	72518	72518	I	83	“ Hayes has a nemesis ? ”
72532	72536	72537	72537	I	83	“ Brock Sturgis . ”
72565	72575	72576	72576	Keisha	453	“ You do n’t know who Brock Sturgis is , ”
72596	72611	72588	72588	she	83	“ I do n’t read the tabloids , and Hayes and I met online . ”
72666	72682	72683	72683	Her	83	“ I did n’t know anything about his real life until we met in Maine . ”
72708	72887	72888	72888	I	83	“ Brock is n’t tabloid bait . Not outside the city . He ’s old Wall Street money . The Fifth Avenue equivalent of an ambulance chaser now . I was too young when it all went down to really know the nuances , but I know he and Hayes were besties in grade school , then had a major falling out in high school when Hayes realized Brock was copying his homework and spreading rumors about him behind his back . And once Hayes put his foot down , the bullying started . Kids are shits . That ’s as much of that part of the story as you ’re getting from me . And then after college , Hayes started dating Trixie Melhoff , and he fell in luuuuuuuurrve . Not just normal love . Like , even I remember how he could basically talk about nothing but Trixie this and Trixie that and he was shopping for rings and had already basically proposed when he found out she was sleeping with Brock behind his back . ”
72891	72974	72888	72888	I	83	“ Yeah . The guy who almost got Hayes kicked out of fancy high school prep school by claiming Hayes was copying him , then saying Hayes had mental health issues and he needed to be institutionalized , like mental health issues are something to be ashamed of , and then sliding the tabloids lies about Hayes doing drugs to cope with his weird sexual fetishes all through college , and I am not saying any more . I ’m really not . ”
72975	72981	72982	72982	I	83	“ Your family ’s reputation , ”
72989	73168	72985	72985	She	83	“ Right ? Uncle Greg and Aunt Gio were beside themselves . I mean , they believed Hayes when he said it was all lies , but the lengths they had to go to for damage control ? They were lucky Hayes is the weird one is the worst that ever took hold in public . And you know what ? I do n’t like to call women bitches . I think we should support each other , and I think we all have more to give than just chasing billionaires for their money , but that bitch Trixie ? She can rot in hell . Most normal women who want to use Hayes would ’ve cozied up to him to get close to Jonas instead , and believe me , plenty did , but no . She accepted his proposal while sleeping with his mortal enemy . His former best friend who bullied him all through school . That ’s like — that ’s the worst kind of betrayal . And that ’s all I ’m saying . ”
73173	73179	72985	72985	She	83	“ Why are people cruel ? ”
73180	73326	73343	73343	she	83	“ I do n’t know . But he has n’t had another serious girlfriend since . I think he tried once or twice , but you know how it is when you ’re rich and famous . Everyone has an angle . And all of them had angles . So everyone in the family ’s trying to find someone he could marry without loving so that he does n’t have to go through all of this ridiculous press and publicity with being the last eligible billionaire on the planet . And he ’s not , for the record . There are like , three single women billionaires who are in their thirties and forties , and is anyone talking about them ? No . Fucking two - faced twats . So . What ’s your angle ? What do I have to murder you for ? ”
73352	73362	73363	73363	Keisha	453	“ Okay , I wo n’t really murder you , ”
73366	73382	73383	73383	She	83	“ Stop crying . I hate crying . Crying makes me bleeeaaaaaa , you know ? ”
73391	73411	73412	73412	I	83	“ I wish he ’d been born to a normal , middle - class family outside of the spotlight , ”
73435	73452	73428	73428	she	83	“ Fuck , B. That ’s like , the worst thing you could ’ve ever said . ”
73453	73456	73428	73428	she	83	“ Why ? ”
73457	73468	73428	73428	she	83	“ Because that ’s what I wish for him too . ”
74400	74470	74387	74387	he	2931	“ No , Dexter , if you want approval , you ’ll need to send it through the proper channels . I ’m not interested in acting as your shortcut . No . No . No . Do I need to say no once more ? Call my office and make an appointment if you want to discuss this further . We ’re done for now . Good night . ”
74590	74611	74576	74576	he	2931	“ Begonia . Apologies . This afternoon turned into one crisis after another , and I lost track of time . ”
74937	74943	74944	74944	he	2931	“ You must be famished , ”
74950	75042	74944	74944	he	2931	“ I had some duck with your family . And it was only mildly awkward when Uncle Antonio started talking about a few women he knows that he could invite out here , and then when your mother asked if he was ready to date again to try to cover for him , and then when Keisha pretended she was whispering to me that they ’re all a - holes , when she was n’t actually whispering at all and everyone heard her . What about you ? Have you eaten ? ”
75043	75054	75065	75065	he	1769	“ We stock Razzle Dazzle treats in all the offices . ”
75055	75058	75059	75059	I	83	“ Hayes . ”
75073	75090	75065	75065	he	1769	“ I ’m shocked , bluebell . You seem the type to embrace snacks for dinner . ”
75091	75105	75106	75106	He	1769	“ On vacation . Not when you ’re working fourteen - hour days . ”
75119	75126	75106	75106	He	1769	“ Apologies for your awful dinner . ”
75127	75211	75212	75212	Hayes	2931	“ That was actually just the soup course . Dinner itself was n’t all bad . Françoise and I made friends today , so she snuck a live cricket onto your mom ’s plate , and then Marshmallow tried to save her from the scary cricket and ended up running across the table and almost catching his fur and another tablecloth on fire . I think you should have a no - candles rule as long as Marshmallow and I are in residence . ”
75219	75232	75212	75212	Hayes	2931	“ Are you laughing or having serious regrets about bringing me here ? ”
75262	75267	75268	75268	He	2931	“ I ’m laughing . ”
75288	75296	75279	75279	my	83	“ At me , or with me ? ”
75297	75316	75247	75247	he	2931	“ Out of sheer regret that I missed the show . Is my mother packing her bags yet ? ”
75317	75335	75279	75279	my	83	“ She says she has to be in Los Angeles for a dinner for some foundation tomorrow . ”
75336	75346	75279	75279	my	83	“ Excellent . Did you make lovely art today ? ”
75347	75361	75362	75362	He	2931	“ Shh . No more talking until you eat something good for you . ”
75415	75420	75421	75421	I	83	“ F - food , ”
75426	75434	75421	75421	I	83	“ I believe I ’d prefer sleep . ”
75435	75453	75421	75421	I	83	“ You need both . And I mean sleep in the real sense of the word sleep . ”
75454	75460	75461	75461	I	83	“ Is the bedroom fixed ? ”
75464	75519	75461	75461	I	83	“ No . Your housekeeper and Keisha had an argument over whether the table that was under the flaming tablecloth could be saved , and the chairs still smell like smoke and stale water , and apparently having a clay art room assembled in an hour is as far as your money went today . ”
75520	75523	75524	75524	He	2931	“ Hm . ”
75589	75598	75599	75599	He	2931	“ A - ha ! You are hungry . ”
75620	75626	75599	75599	He	2931	“ Can you hold this ? ”
75627	75644	75650	75650	he	2931	“ It ’s a little heavy , but yes , I think I can — erp ! ”
75677	75680	75672	75672	him	2931	“ Hayes . ”
75681	75705	75706	75706	he	2931	“ Robert , close the door behind us , and do n’t let anyone else leave this house if they want to live , ”
75712	75717	75718	75718	Robert	1310	“ Yes , sir , ”
75723	75727	75718	75718	Robert	1310	“ Thank you . ”
75728	75736	75737	75737	Hayes	2931	“ Do n’t hurt yourself , sir . ”
75743	75749	75740	75740	He	2931	“ Do n’t do that , ”
75785	75791	75779	75779	Chad	91	“ Do what , love ? ”
75792	75799	75762	75762	he	2931	“ Smile . Do not smile . ”
75800	75813	75814	75814	He	2931	“ I had the most fascinating text messages all day long today . ”
75873	75883	75867	75867	he	2931	“ I would n’t call our text messages fascinating . ”
75884	75891	75892	75892	he	2931	“ Jonas is enjoying his honeymoon , ”
75924	75980	75917	75917	he	2931	“ My mother also has opinions about an interior designer for renovating my bedroom suite . Uncle Antonio is sorry he thought Liliane would be a welcome guest . He tells me he helped set up your pottery wheel himself . And Keisha tells me she told you all of my deepest , darkest secrets . ”
75981	75990	75991	75991	I	83	“ She only did it because she cares , ”
75995	76007	75991	75991	I	83	“ Yes , clearly breaking trust is a sign of caring . ”
76008	76018	76019	76019	His	1779	“ Would you have told me about Brock Sturgis ? ”
76023	76035	76019	76019	His	1779	“ She truly did tell you everything , did n’t she ? ”
76036	76044	75917	75917	he	2931	“ She did n’t go into detail . ”
76045	76048	75917	75917	he	2931	“ Hm . ”
76049	76073	76019	76019	His	1779	“ I wo n’t repeat a thing . But I think I understand better why your mom hovers . Everyone worries about you . ”
76074	76084	75917	75917	he	2931	“ I am not a frail flower , Begonia . ”
76085	76119	75917	75917	he	2931	“ That ’s really funny , because technically , a begonia is kind of a frail flower , so it ’s like you ’re pointing out that I am when you ’re not . ”
76120	76139	76019	76019	His	1779	“ You are not a frail flower either . God help the person who mistakes you for one . ”
76140	76158	75917	75917	he	2931	“ I know I ’m not , and I know you ’re not . You ’re just … ”
76159	76165	75917	75917	he	2931	“ I ’m just … ? ”
76166	76208	76019	76019	His	1779	“ Stuck in a world where you can either let it suck away your soul or be alone . And that ’s not fair . Or easy , I ’d guess . How does everyone else in your family do it ? ”
76209	76341	75917	75917	he	2931	“ They do n’t feel it as personally , I suppose . Did n’t have the magnitude of betrayal . Or they do n’t mind . Or they appreciate the luxuries enough that the trade - off is worth it . My father married well . And not in a money sense , but in a trust and true love sense . My parents were high school sweethearts , in fact , from a time before my mother understood what would be expected of her . He ’s never worried about her stabbing him in the back , nor has he had to . Uncle Antonio did n’t fare as well , but he ’s my mother ’s brother , so he ’s shielded from the expectations of being a Rutherford . ”
76342	76349	76350	76350	I	83	“ And he ’s a man , ”
76357	76376	76354	76354	Hayes	2931	“ That does present another level of protection in the eyes of the world , does n’t it ? ”
76377	76385	75917	75917	he	2931	“ But you did n’t escape it . ”
76386	76417	76354	76354	Hayes	2931	“ I did for a time , leaving the country to study abroad and ignoring the tabloids and letting my family handle any issues . Ignorance truly is bliss sometimes . ”
76418	76426	76354	76354	Hayes	2931	“ Would you tell me what happened ? ”
76427	76432	75917	75917	he	2931	“ You want details ? ”
76433	76436	76437	76437	I	83	“ Yes . ”
76491	76516	76486	76486	he	1780	“ Begonia , this is too lovely of a night to ruin it with old memories that I refuse to let haunt me anymore . ”
76517	76552	76486	76486	he	1780	“ So , you needed a fake girlfriend because you ’re perfectly fine and well - adjusted and have no lingering trust issues after your fiancée committed the ultimate betrayal like fifteen years ago ? ”
76553	76574	76486	76486	he	1780	“ You ’re so very cruel , yet so very irresistible at the same time . However do you manage ? ”
76575	76585	76586	76586	I	83	“ I wo n’t hurt you , you know , ”
76589	76632	76586	76586	I	83	“ If you want to use me to learn to trust someone again , I ’m okay with that . And I realize that saying you can trust me is basically a red flag that means you probably should n’t , but — ”
76633	76636	76486	76486	he	1780	“ Begonia . ”
76637	76640	76641	76641	He	1782	“ Yes ? ”
76719	76737	76701	76701	He	1782	“ Sit . Have dinner with me and tell me all the good that I missed today . ”
76738	76746	76747	76747	He	1782	“ You want to hear me talk . ”
76907	76919	76900	76900	I	83	“ Is this for you , or is it for me ? ”
76994	77017	77018	77019	This man	404	“ For both of us , I had hoped . You seem to enjoy picnics , and I … I enjoy you . ”
77081	77086	77075	77075	she	348	“ Is someone listening ? ”
77090	77101	77102	77102	He	404	“ Are there more camera people hiding in the woods ? ”
77109	77112	77102	77102	He	404	“ Oh . ”
77113	77118	77119	77119	He	404	“ Begonia . No . ”
77124	77184	77119	77119	He	404	“ The photographers on Oysterberry Bay — I apologize . I don’t — you are correct . I do n’t trust easily , and I thought it necessary . But here , we ’re alone . You have my word . This is not for the world . This is for me . And , I hope , you . ”
77192	77198	77199	77199	I	83	“ I enjoy you too , ”
77202	77212	77213	77213	I	83	“ You should n’t . I ’m very disagreeable . ”
77301	77304	77305	77305	I	83	“ Hayes , ”
77308	77326	77305	77305	I	83	“ I would very much like to make love to you under the moonlight , Ms. Fairchild . ”
77381	77387	77388	77388	he	1792	“ With my eyes open , ”
77410	77429	77388	77388	he	1792	“ fully aware that I ’m with you , with you fully aware that you ’re with me . ”
77479	77484	77485	77485	I	83	“ No fires tonight , ”
77497	77510	77488	77488	His	1792	“ On the contrary , I hope to set you on fire . ”
77598	77603	77604	77606	The poor pup	1797	“ Move , Marshmallow . ”
77610	77623	77624	77624	Hayes	2931	“ I ’m going to do unspeakably filthy things to your mother , ”
77881	77897	77863	77863	He	1792	“ Just when I thought you could n’t possibly get any more attractive , bluebell … ”
77898	77909	77863	77863	He	1792	“ Want me to do the same to your pants ? ”
77910	77913	77863	77863	He	1792	“ Yes . ”
77914	77923	77950	77950	He	1792	“ Are you adding this to my bill ? ”
77924	77949	77950	77950	He	1792	“ Payable in sexual favors . Where is that sweet nipple I found yesterday ? I miss it . Ah . Here it is . ”
78066	78072	78049	78049	He	1792	“ Your fingers are exquisite . ”
78073	78095	78096	78096	He	1792	“ Your body is extis — etiquette — oh my god , I ca n’t talk when I ’m this horny . ”
78115	78121	78096	78096	He	1792	“ More practice , Begaaaaaaaaaaah … ”
78140	78145	78122	78122	I	83	“ You were saying ? ”
78146	78154	78155	78155	He	1792	“ D - don’t ss - stop . ”
78184	78191	78192	78192	He	1792	“ I want to taste you . ”
78201	78209	78192	78192	He	1792	“ I want to be inside you . ”
78210	78225	78226	78226	God	2482	“ I ’ll rock - paper - scissors you for who ’s in charge . ”
78253	78279	78280	78280	He	1792	“ No negotiations , Ms. Oh , fuck yes . Begonia . Fuck . No rock p - paper — keep your hands — yes . ”
78323	78330	78331	78331	I	83	“ I love how you feel , ”
78361	78364	78358	78358	I	83	“ Hayes ? ”
78365	78373	78374	78374	I	83	“ Condom . Inside you . Now . ”
78419	78424	78414	78414	I	83	“ Let me help . ”
78425	78436	78437	78437	His	1792	“ Got it . You . Strip . For me . ”
78451	78457	78437	78437	His	1792	“ You like me naked . ”
78458	78475	78476	78476	I	83	“ I need you naked . I ’ve needed you naked with me all fucking day . ”
78511	78519	78520	78520	I	83	“ I love when you say fuck . ”
78563	78569	78552	78552	him	1792	“ It ’s so improper . ”
78570	78582	78587	78587	I	83	“ I intend to fuck you until you ca n’t walk . ”
78583	78586	78587	78587	I	83	“ Yes . ”
78722	78728	78729	78729	he	1792	“ I want you now , ”
78753	78756	78735	78735	I	83	“ Yes . ”
78757	78762	78767	78767	He	1792	“ Slow next time . ”
78763	78766	78767	78767	He	1792	“ Yes . ”
78785	78788	78789	78789	he	1792	“ Heaven , ”
78805	78808	78809	78809	I	83	“ More , ”
78812	78816	78809	78809	I	83	“ So tight . ”
78817	78821	78828	78828	He	1792	“ So hard . ”
78822	78827	78828	78828	He	1792	“ So fucking good . ”
78841	78852	78828	78828	He	1792	“ There , Hayes . Oh my god , there . ”
78853	78862	78828	78828	He	1792	“ Louder , Begonia . Scream for me . ”
78863	78871	78872	78872	He	1792	“ You … feel … so good . ”
78919	78922	78923	78923	Hayes	2931	“ Begonia , ”
78926	78949	78923	78923	Hayes	2931	“ Bluebell , I ’m so fucking close . Baby , I need you to come . Come all over my cock . ”
78998	79001	79002	79002	he	1792	“ Begonia , ”
79107	79124	79125	79125	Hayes	2931	“ Dear god , you ’re going to murder me with sex , are n’t you ? ”
79128	79135	79125	79125	Hayes	2931	“ Can we do that again ? ”
79136	79155	79156	79156	I	83	“ Correction : You would murder me with denying me sex . I would die of blue balls . ”
79245	79250	79239	79239	He	2931	“ Are you hungry ? ”
79279	79282	79283	79283	he	2931	“ No , ”
79286	79295	79296	79296	He	2931	“ I ’m too content to be hungry . ”
79301	79304	79296	79296	He	2931	“ Begonia ? ”
79305	79308	79296	79296	He	2931	“ Hmm ? ”
79309	79316	79317	79317	My	83	“ Thank you for being you . ”
79459	79467	79468	79468	she	83	“ What kind of cheese is this ? ”
79495	79503	79504	79504	I	83	“ No idea . I need another . ”
79531	79546	79547	79547	I	83	“ Mr. Rutherford , are you trying to get me to feed you again ? ”
79560	79594	79547	79547	I	83	“ What good is it to have a Greek painting brought to life if she does n’t let me lie with my head in her lap and feed me grapes off the vine ? ”
79595	79603	79554	79554	she	83	“ I am not a Greek painting . ”
79604	79612	79613	79613	She	83	“ Correct . You ’re much lovelier . ”
79645	79664	79635	79635	she	83	“ You may have another sample , but not until you tell me if you ’ve ever camped . ”
79665	79669	79635	79635	she	83	“ Like this ? ”
79670	79712	79635	79635	she	83	“ No , like in a tent in the woods , roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over the fire and telling ghost stories until you ca n’t sleep because every raccoon or squirrel sounds like the claw coming to get you . ”
79713	79717	79718	79718	She	83	“ Not recently . ”
79802	79809	79812	79812	her	83	“ You ’ve slept outdoors often ? ”
79814	79851	79810	79810	I	83	“ When I was little , Hyacinth and I used to sleep wherever we got tired when we were running around our Dad ’s camp all summer long . We woke up once in a canoe . ”
79852	79857	79941	79941	she	1810	“ On the water ? ”
79858	79880	79881	79881	I	83	“ I swore a blood oath to Hy that I ’d never , ever , ever reveal more details than that . ”
79884	79895	79881	79881	I	83	“ And did you weave your secrets into friendship bracelets ? ”
79896	79924	79810	79810	I	83	“ We did ! And we made candles and tie - dyed T - shirts and that ’s the first place I ever used a pottery wheel . ”
79925	79932	79933	79933	She	1810	“ At your father ’s camp ? ”
79944	80007	79941	79941	she	1810	“ He had the most adorable art hut . Every summer after Mom and Dad divorced , we ’d spend it out at Camp Funshine . And the minute Mom let us out of the car , Hy would race for the archery range or the ropes course , and I ’d dash off in the other direction for the art hut . ”
80023	80028	79881	79881	I	83	“ You miss it ? ”
80029	80096	80097	80097	I	83	“ Dad gave so many kids the best memories of their summers , and we met so many kids from all over the world . There was this girl I met from — oh my gosh , you know what ? I ca n’t start , because if I start telling you about all of the people I met there , I would literally never stop . ”
80105	80114	80103	80103	Begonia	83	“ Have you been back as an adult ? ”
80115	80151	80157	80157	her	83	“ No . The people who bought it when Dad declared bankruptcy just wanted the land . And the lake . And the stables . It’s — it ’s not what it used to be . ”
80270	80276	80284	80284	I	83	“ Your father declared bankruptcy . ”
80300	80336	80288	80288	Begonia	348	“ Yes . It was n’t pleasant , but he survived . I mean , not long , but it was n’t … It was n’t bankruptcy that killed him . That was an accident . ”
80337	80351	80352	80352	Her	348	“ You were n’t terrified at all when I threatened to sue you . ”
80360	80407	80352	80352	Her	348	“ I would ’ve been sad if you ’d followed through and I had to raise funds by putting my great - grandma Eileen ’s old dildo collection on eBay to afford my own legal fees , but yes , I know I would ’ve survived . ”
80408	80415	80288	80288	Begonia	348	“ I ’m quite the asshole . ”
80416	80431	80432	80432	I	83	“ Hayes . You found a total stranger making a disaster of your house . ”
80443	80453	80432	80432	I	83	“ That turned out far better than I expected . ”
80454	80461	80462	80462	she	348	“ And look at us now , ”
80472	80479	80432	80432	I	83	“ Do you still enjoy camping ? ”
80480	80523	80432	80432	I	83	“ I used to , but then — well , then I grew up and did what I thought grown - ups should do , which is dumb , is n’t it ? Why ca n’t grown - ups have fun too ? ”
80524	80534	80535	80535	She	348	“ Are you not having fun tonight , Begonia ? ”
80699	80763	80688	80688	she	348	“ I ’m having the best time . Do you know what ? Summer camp should be a thing for grown - ups too . We should get to play and have fun and let someone else make us cafeteria food after we spend the morning canoeing and swimming and horseback riding , and then get to have grown - up time afterwards . ”
80764	80801	80688	80688	she	348	“ You ’ve just described Rutherford family reunions , but without the horrors of cafeteria food , and I honestly do n’t want to know which of my relatives are engaging in grown - up time . ”
80802	80832	80833	80833	I	83	“ Did you go to summer camp as a kid ? The traditional kind where you sleep away from your parents for a week or more at a time ? ”
80844	80875	80833	80833	I	83	“ Every summer from six to sixteen , but it was crew — rowing — camp , or lacrosse camp , or math camp , or college application prep camp . ”
80876	80884	80688	80688	she	348	“ Did you shoot bows and arrows ? ”
80885	80888	80688	80688	she	348	“ No . ”
80889	80895	80833	80833	I	83	“ Paddleboard on the lake ? ”
80896	80899	80688	80688	she	348	“ No . ”
80900	80907	80688	80688	she	348	“ Eat s’mores around the campfire ? ”
80908	80936	80937	80937	She	1818	“ We had crème brûlée and chocolate lava cakes catered by Michelin - level chefs while we sat around getting lectures about how to apply for college . ”
80940	80954	80955	80955	I	83	“ Had you never had a s’more before our campfire picnic in Maine ? ”
80965	80977	80955	80955	I	83	“ How many Razzle Dazzle films have you seen , bluebell ? ”
80978	81031	81032	81032	I	83	“ At least four hundred thirty - seven . I was watching them before Jonas started getting starring roles . I miss the days when Hank Houseman was your main lead . He was too old for me to be attracted to , but I could n’t help myself . Just shew . ”
81040	81057	81058	81058	She	1818	“ How many of those four hundred thirty - seven Razzle Dazzle films had campfire scenes ? ”
81117	81124	81125	81125	she	1818	“ Are you telling me lies ? ”
81128	81159	81125	81125	she	1818	“ College application prep camp ? You are ! You ’re making that up , and you ’ve had s’mores , and you did go to traditional summer sleepaway camp . ”
81160	81175	81125	81125	she	1818	“ I believe it ’s called teasing when done in the midst of flirting . ”
81176	81185	81125	81125	she	1818	“ You are the most adorable flirter ever . ”
81186	81189	81190	81190	She	1818	“ Adorable ? ”
81194	81198	81199	81199	I	83	“ So adorable . ”
81247	81255	81239	81239	I	83	“ Maybe I should show you adorable . ”
81273	81276	81277	81277	she	1818	“ More , ”
81378	81401	81402	81402	Keisha	453	“ Did you save some charcuterie for the squirrels and the birds , or did you do something super kinky with it ? ”
81422	81426	81405	81405	Hayes	348	“ Go away . ”
81427	81450	81451	81451	I	83	“ Your mother ’s looking for you . Something about the dog and a movie script she was supposed to be evaluating . ”
81454	81458	81459	81459	Hayes	348	“ Ignore her , ”
81463	81496	81497	81497	Keisha	453	“ My mother does n’t evaluate movie scripts . Not to say your dog did n’t attempt to help her with her perfume , but Marshmallow would not be stealing important paperwork . ”
81500	81505	81506	81506	I	83	“ Nice tattoo , B. ”
81536	81559	81560	81560	he	1823	“ Go away , Keisha , or I ’ll tell Millie what you do with your drummer when you ’re on tour , ”
81591	81596	81588	81588	She	453	“ You would n’t . ”
81597	81606	81607	81607	I	83	“ Oh my god , are you cheating ? ”
81614	81633	81607	81607	I	83	“ I do n’t want to know . No . I do n’t . Do n’t ruin this . ”
81634	81655	81656	81656	Hayes	156	“ Yes , she ’s cheating . And her version of cheating is three am runs to Baskin - Robbins , ”
81661	81670	81656	81656	Hayes	156	“ She ’s diabetic , and Millie worries . ”
81671	81675	81676	81676	Keisha	453	“ Shut up , ”
81679	81691	81692	81692	Hayes	156	“ It ’s nothing to be embarrassed about , dear cousin , ”
81695	81743	81692	81692	Hayes	156	“ I ’m not embarrassed . I do n’t want to have a fight with Millie if she hears you talking smack and spilling my secrets . And I can have ice cream . I can . She overreacts to everything because she loves me so much . ”
81763	81768	81769	81769	Keisha	453	“ Relax , B , ”
81772	81791	81792	81792	Hayes	156	“ Marshmallow ’s inside . Françoise has him . She ’s almost as good with him as Hayes . ”
81805	81815	81816	81816	he	1825	“ He took our clothing , did n’t he ? ”
81822	81884	81819	81819	Keisha	453	“ It ’s aaaaall over the downstairs . He took Begonia ’s bra in to your father , and your mom has your boxers . My dad got the strip of condoms . It ’s too bad Liliane left , or maybe she could ’ve gotten your tie and Begonia ’s panties . This is like , the best morning ever . ”
81885	81899	81900	81900	I	83	“ How is it I still like her even when she ’s evil ? ”
81912	81927	81904	81904	He	1826	“ I have no idea . I ’m not suffering from the same affliction . ”
81972	81983	81984	81984	she	348	“ Robert ’s coming with clothes for both of you , ”
81988	82005	81984	81984	she	348	“ But it was just too fun to catch you sleeping outside naked like randy teenagers . ”
82006	82017	82018	82018	Hayes	348	“ Good . I ’ll have him throw you out . ”
82061	82068	82069	82069	Keisha	453	“ But where would I go ? ”
82072	82127	82069	82069	Keisha	453	“ You know Millie ’s allergic to South Carolina this time of year , so that house is out . There ’s a chance of wildfires out west , so those two houses are out . If I head into the city , I ’ll eat cheesecake all day , so that ’s out … ”
82128	82131	82132	82132	Hayes	156	“ Antarctica , ”
82158	82170	82171	82171	Keisha	453	“ Begonia , have you ever seen a K - drama ? ”
82174	82194	82171	82171	Keisha	453	“ We should totes have a girls morning and you can explain to me why penises are worth it . ”
82195	82204	82205	82205	Hayes	348	“ Do n’t you have work to do ? ”
82208	82217	82218	82218	She	348	“ No one works on a forced sabbatical . ”
82236	82243	82244	82244	I	83	“ Why are you on sabbatical ? ”
82247	82281	82244	82244	I	83	“ Do you know the best thing about being a distant Rutherford relative ? They seriously cover up some shit . And I like you , B , but I ’m not telling . ”
82282	82297	82298	82298	Hayes	348	“ Understandable . If you want to talk , though , I ’m around . ”
82303	82344	82345	82345	She	348	“ You have three seconds to leave before I treat you to a full frontal and chase you back to the house and tell Begonia all of your secrets . You told her mine . I ’ll happily spill yours . ”
82351	82378	82345	82345	She	348	“ Fine . I ’m going . Come find me for breakfast , Begonia . I want to know how you got that awesome hair color . ”
82391	82399	82381	82381	she	348	“ Have you chased her naked before ? ”
82400	82415	82426	82426	Keisha	453	“ No , but she believes I ’d do it . That ’s enough . ”
82416	82425	82426	82426	Keisha	453	“ Such a terrible threat , Mr. Rutherford . ”
82493	82535	82536	82536	I	83	“ It was you or me , and she already has the advantage of seeing some mystery tattoo that I have yet to discover on your body . I have no intention of letting her see it more before I do . ”
82542	82552	82536	82536	I	83	“ You did n’t look closely enough in Maine . ”
82553	82566	82581	82581	He	2931	“ I was quite unaware of who I ’d found in Maine . ”
82567	82580	82581	82581	He	2931	“ And you were tired and cranky and expecting an empty house . ”
82595	82605	82606	82606	he	2931	“ I ’m tired of being tired and cranky , ”
82609	82618	82606	82606	he	2931	“ Are you tired and cranky right now ? ”
82619	82629	82630	82630	I	83	“ I ’m far more content than I trust . ”
82669	82681	82660	82660	he	2931	“ Do n’t question it . Just let yourself have it . ”
82682	82687	82696	82696	Robert	1310	“ Begonia , I — ”
82688	82695	82696	82696	Robert	1310	“ Your clothes , Mr. Rutherford , ”
82701	82719	82720	82720	I	83	“ Merriweather called and reported you ’ve been requested for interviews with several news networks this morning . ”
82799	82806	82783	82783	his	2931	“ Why did Merriweather call you ? ”
82807	82818	82819	82819	Robert	1310	“ I located your phone in the freezer , sir , ”
82846	82859	82841	82841	I	83	“ Is that the weirdest place you ’ve ever found a phone ? ”
82890	82895	82896	82896	he	1310	“ Today , ma’am , ”
82899	82906	82896	82896	he	1310	“ Nikolay would ’ve told me . ”
82969	82983	82984	82984	Hayes	348	“ We ’ll be back at the house in fifteen minutes , Robert , ”
82987	83009	83010	83010	I	83	“ Certainly , sir . But as a matter of note , your father ’s requested a video conference over breakfast . ”
83013	83028	83010	83010	I	83	“ Are n’t your parents here ? I thought Marshmallow took them our clothes . ”
83029	83046	83047	83047	Hayes	348	“ We ’re an early - rising , early - working , early - traveling family , ”
83050	83057	83047	83047	Hayes	348	“ Also , never trust Keisha . ”
83058	83068	83069	83069	Robert	1310	“ Unless you ’re broke and lost in Amsterdam , ”
83072	83083	83084	83084	Hayes	348	“ Or facing down a gang of kangaroos outside Sydney , ”
83087	83093	83084	83084	Hayes	348	“ Fifteen minutes , Robert . ”
83094	83099	83084	83084	Hayes	348	“ Yes , sir . ”
83100	83107	83108	83108	I	83	“ Thank you for the clothes , ”
83135	83170	83120	83120	Hayes	348	“ I ’m quite irritated that your dog stole my condoms . And I would very much like to have been the first person in my family to have studied this tattoo of yours . ”
83183	83195	83196	83196	His	1310	“ Guess I ’ll have to make that up to you . ”
83212	83215	83196	83196	His	1310	“ Begonia ? ”
83216	83221	83231	83231	My	83	“ Yes , Hayes ? ”
83222	83230	83231	83231	My	83	“ I will never forget this moment . ”
83308	83315	83302	83302	Merriweather	211	“ Mrs. Werenski , Mr. Rutherford . ”
83420	83427	83417	83417	I	83	“ Do n’t make that face , ”
83464	83498	83453	83453	she	453	“ Third pregnancies always make you look like you could deliver any minute from the fifth month on . So . Are you making an honest woman of my sister , or what ? ”
83504	83511	83512	83512	She	453	“ Good luck , Mr. Rutherford . ”
83551	83559	83540	83540	I	83	“ Hyacinth . Thank you for coming . ”
83560	83588	83599	83599	Evan	267	“ Oh , you are fancy . Are you sure you ’re in love with my sister ? She ’s as anti - fancy as they get . ”
83589	83598	83599	83599	Evan	267	“ All the more reason to adore her . ”
83604	83628	83599	83599	Evan	267	“ Hyacinth , meet Mr. Sirotkin . We ’re hoping you could help us narrow down choices for a surprise for your sister . ”
83629	83634	83599	83599	Evan	267	“ Are those diamonds ? ”
83635	83641	83599	83599	Evan	267	“ Yes , Mrs. Werenski . ”
83642	83660	83661	83661	She	1849	“ Like , that whole thing is a diamond ? All of those whole things are diamonds ? ”
83692	83695	83687	83687	I	83	“ Yes . ”
83710	83734	83704	83704	Evan	267	“ I ’m trying to decide if I should ask how well you know my sister , or how badly you fucked up . ”
83798	83808	83809	83809	I	83	“ Evan , could you give us a moment ? ”
83812	83819	83809	83809	I	83	“ Shall I leave the jewels ? ”
83820	83831	83832	83832	Hyacinth	83	“ Only if he ’s buying them for someone else , ”
83847	83856	83857	83857	he	1853	“ Your mother ’s birthday is coming up , ”
83865	83883	83857	83857	he	1853	“ Jonas drew the short end of the stick this year . He ’ll be in touch . ”
83890	83914	83857	83857	he	1853	“ I keep forgetting you ’re Jonas Rutherford ’s brother . Can I touch you again ? Maybe have a lick in absentia ? ”
83915	83918	83857	83857	he	1853	“ No . ”
83919	83940	83857	83857	he	1853	“ Phew . Thank you . If you can be a little more dickish like that , it ’ll help . ”
83974	83980	83967	83967	Hyacinth	83	“ Is this place bugged ? ”
83981	83984	83857	83857	he	1853	“ No . ”
83985	83999	83857	83857	he	1853	“ Will Begonia get in trouble with you if I ask rude questions ? ”
84000	84041	83967	83967	Hyacinth	83	“ Your sister could talk her way out of a murder conviction if she were caught holding a bloody knife over the victim . If the police do n’t stand a chance , I fail to see how I do . ”
84042	84070	84071	84071	My	83	“ Because she would n’t have done it . There would be a logical explanation . Probably that her dog did it , but he was justified . ”
84075	84084	84085	84085	Her	83	“ Oh my god , you almost smiled . ”
84092	84198	84085	84085	Her	83	“ Are you seriously dating my sister , or are you blackmailing her with something , or is she doing you a favor ? What ’s going on here ? This has all the makings of a Razzle Dazzle movie , and Begonia is totally lying to me about something , probably a lot of things , and I ’m pretty sure you ’re banging her , but that does n’t mean anything beyond that she ’s getting some nookie post - divorce so she can get back on that horse for real again soon . I mean , if you ’re not for real . ”
84214	84219	84199	84199	I	83	“ Are you finished ? ”
84220	84353	84354	84354	Hyacinth	83	“ No . Not even close . Is Jonas ’s marriage real , or was that staged for someone ’s reputation rehab , because Peyton Baker ? Really ? And if you two were the two last eligible male billionaires left on the planet , that would almost be too much , you know ? And totally unfair to you , because he ’d get all the attention , but then , he always does , does n’t he ? It ’s like I always thought Begonia would resent me for getting all the attention , but she ’s just so nice , and she did n’t care that I got to play Annie in the school play and she was stuck in the chorus , because she ’s always — oof . ”
84370	84376	84364	84364	I	83	“ Are you in labor ? ”
84377	84401	84402	84402	She	83	“ No , the little bastard just kicked me in the ribs . He does n’t like it when I talk too much . ”
84407	84421	84402	84402	She	83	“ Do not say a word . I ’ve heard it all already . ”
84452	84467	84445	84445	She	83	“ Your turn . Spill your guts . Why are you dating my sister ? ”
84468	84487	84445	84445	She	83	“ She ’s disarmingly attractive , inside and out , and I ca n’t seem to help myself . ”
84488	84501	84445	84445	She	83	“ Did you really make her sign a non - disclosure agreement ? ”
84502	84513	84445	84445	She	83	“ I made you sign a non - disclosure agreement . ”
84514	84556	84557	84557	She	1856	“ Yeah , but you ’re not dating me . You ’re just tormenting me by not answering my questions after flying me up here on a fancy jet because you thought it would be a nice surprise for my sister . ”
84580	84588	84572	84572	She	1856	“ Are you going to hurt Begonia ? ”
84589	84627	84572	84572	She	1856	“ I will do all in my power to save her any grief , which is unfortunately easier said than done in my world . But I still promise to go above and beyond to protect her . ”
85022	85036	85037	85037	Hyacinth	83	“ Do I really get to see her as part of this trip ? ”
85040	85067	85037	85037	Hyacinth	83	“ Naturally . She needs a new dress for a charity gala in the city tomorrow . I assumed you ’d be her preferred shopping companion . ”
85068	85076	85088	85088	She	83	“ Can I go to the gala ? ”
85077	85087	85088	85088	She	83	“ The Rutherfords are known for not making scenes . ”
85306	85313	85314	85314	I	83	“ Do n’t let Marshmallow in ! ”
85317	85328	85314	85314	I	83	“ Oh my god , you still make penis art ! ”
85383	85395	85373	85374	My sister	2705	“ Look at your belly ! I have to hug him ! ”
85396	85400	85378	85379	my sister	2705	“ Your hands ! ”
85401	85414	85415	85415	I	83	“ Washing machine ! Showers ! You should see the showers here ! ”
85440	85445	85427	85427	I	83	“ You ’re here ! ”
85446	85450	85451	85451	She	2705	“ Oh , B. ”
85476	85487	85455	85455	she	2705	“ I think you just got clay in my mouth . ”
85488	85507	85455	85455	she	2705	“ There ’s toothpaste ! And spare toothbrushes ! That ’s fixable ! What are you doing here ? ”
85508	85609	85455	85455	she	2705	“ Hayes said you missed me so he sent a fucking private jet to get me and a private nanny to stay behind with my kids and we ’re going to the spa and taking you shopping for a new fucking dress and what did you do and how did you meet this man and does he have a secret twin ? I do n’t want another husband , but I could totally do with a rich lover who buys me fancy dresses and takes me to fancy balls . Oh my god , Begonia . Just oh my god . ”
85610	85625	85626	85626	She	1874	“ You ca n’t go to the ball ! Rutherfords do n’t make scenes . ”
85657	85664	85644	85644	she	1874	“ Aww , did he kick ? ”
85665	85677	85678	85678	She	1874	“ He does not like it when I talk too much . ”
85684	85726	85678	85678	She	1874	“ I ’m not having a baby this time . I ’m having a demon spawn . I know I called Dani a demon spawn when I was pregnant with her too , but I think I mean it this time . ”
85727	85738	85739	85739	Keisha	453	“ Oh my god , there are two of you ? ”
85783	85787	85788	85788	I	83	“ The clay ! ”
85810	85820	85821	85821	Hyacinth	83	“ Oh my god , you ’re Keisha Kourtney , ”
85824	85835	85836	85836	Keisha	453	“ Is that some kind of weird smeared penis art ? ”
85839	85849	85836	85836	Keisha	453	“ Dude . I do not understand straight women . ”
85850	85856	85857	85857	I	83	“ It ’s a cup , ”
85899	85918	85919	85919	I	83	“ I ’m not the greatest with pottery , but I love how it feels in my hands , ”
85922	85967	85919	85919	I	83	“ That ’s cool , but if that ’s also how you treat Hayes ’s penis , I do n’t want to know , okay ? Oh , hello . Did n’t know we were doing the touching thing , but it ’s cool . ”
85968	85973	85974	85974	Hyacinth	83	“ You ’re real . ”
85983	85994	85974	85974	Hyacinth	83	“ You ’re not some kind of mirage or hologram . ”
85995	86008	85919	85919	I	83	“ Keisha , this is Hyacinth . She ’s my twin sister . ”
86009	86023	86024	86024	I	83	“ And here I thought she was your illegitimate love child with yourself . ”
86029	86036	86037	86037	She	83	“ Are you and Millie fighting ? ”
86040	86098	86037	86037	She	83	“ No . Yes . Maybe . Do you know your dog weighs more than I do and he ’s trying very hard to get in there to eat your clay penis and a little thank you , Keisha , goddess of the sky and feathers and felines would totally be in order here right about now . ”
86099	86107	86108	86108	Hyacinth	83	“ Marshmallow . Go catch a butterfly , ”
86125	86132	86133	86133	Hy	197	“ Why did n’t that work ? ”
86136	86171	86133	86133	Hy	197	“ He only takes orders from Hayes now . Or sometimes from the chef . Watch this . Marshmallow ! Who wants a steak ? Who ’s a good boy who wants a steak ? ”
86219	86227	86228	86228	I	83	“ Why ’s he on a leash ? ”
86232	86334	86228	86228	I	83	“ I offered to take him for a walk , but the only place he wants to go is upstairs to check on the progress in the bedroom . And god knows if Hayes wants that room finished , he should probably let the dog pick the decorations . Damn man wo n’t make a decision , and I ’ve had it up to here with Aunt Gio telling me I ’m wrong about what he ’d like . Hayes would love a disco ball in his bedroom , and I paid for it , so what ’s the big deal ? ”
86355	86364	86346	86346	I	83	“ What ’s up with you and Millie ? ”
86365	86452	86457	86457	Hyacinth	83	“ She says I ’m overdramatic . Can you believe that ? I literally get paid to be dramatic . Sometimes I have to overdo it to stay current . And we ’re touching the feathers again . Honey , I can afford a new jumpsuit , but you ’re filthy , and it takes about six months to have every one of these sewn on by hand , so can you maybe wait for the touching until I ’m back in silk or glitter polyester ? ”
86453	86456	86457	86457	Hyacinth	83	“ Sorry . ”
86474	86482	86469	86469	she	1878	“ You ’re just so … real . ”
86483	86490	86491	86491	I	83	“ Hy , where ’s Hayes ? ”
86494	86518	86491	86491	I	83	“ At the office . He put me in a helicopter . And this big scary guy stared at me the whole time . ”
86519	86539	86540	86540	Keisha	453	“ Probably thought you were gon na pull a Marshmallow and try to open the door mid - flight , ”
86543	86615	86540	86540	Keisha	453	“ Are you both ready to hit the spa ? Millie hates the spa , and I have to let her stew while she thinks I ’m stewing too . I ’ll send her a new Porsche and it ’ll all blow over — she ca n’t resist a good Porsche — but right now , I need someone wrapping my body in seaweed and telling me my pores are gorgeous . ”
86616	86633	86634	86634	I	83	“ If Françoise has any seaweed in the kitchen , I could do it for you , ”
86637	86651	86652	86652	Keisha	453	“ I have good clay for masks , and your pores are gorgeous . ”
86661	86706	86707	86707	I	83	“ Begonia , I like you a lot , but suggesting DIY spa days in these parts of the social ecosphere is like asking me if I know who Elvis Presley is . You do n’t ask , because you just know the answer . ”
86753	86850	86748	86748	Keisha	453	“ Oh my god , I ’m so glad Hayes finally found someone with a sense of humor . C’m on , ladies . Do n’t even bother getting changed . The spa will have robes for all of us . You . Begonia ’s twin . You ’re gon na have to leave your phone at home because I do n’t trust you yet . No pictures . Maybe later if you quit gaping at me like that . Nikolay ! Nikolay , we need the chopper , please . And Marshmallow needs a babysitter . ”
86856	86867	86868	86868	I	83	“ Down the hall , first door on your right , ”
86872	86892	86893	86893	Keisha	453	“ Stupid pregnancy . I do n’t know if I can get a spa treatment without having to pee . ”
86898	86953	86893	86893	Keisha	453	“ Sweetie , we only go places where you could literally shit on the table and no one would blink . Do n’t shit on the table if you can help it , but for real — they can handle it if you need to pause mid - body wrap to take a piss . ”
87018	87028	87029	87029	Goosebumps	274	“ Good afternoon , Begonia . Having fun today ? ”
87070	87076	87058	87058	I	83	“ You brought me Hyacinth . ”

87235	87243	87244	87244	Keisha	453	“ B , you wash up yet ? ”
87558	87573	87574	87574	Keisha	453	“ Usually they ’d be separate treatments , but we ’re on a timeline , ”
87806	87814	87815	87815	she	83	“ You okay to walk two blocks ? ”
87819	87836	87837	87837	She	83	“ I chase two toddlers all day . I can handle walking two blocks by myself . ”
87876	87934	87871	87871	Keisha	453	“ Keisha ! Keisha , look here ! Keisha , when ’s your next album ? What do you say to the rumors that your ex - girlfriend is dating a man ? Were you involved in Thomas Rutherford ’s death ? Is that your cousin ’s new girlfriend ? Begonia ! Begonia ! Look this way ! ”
87935	87939	87940	87940	Keisha	453	“ Keep walking , ”
87951	87964	87940	87940	Keisha	453	“ Do n’t speak . Either of you . Just keep walking . ”
87996	88003	88004	88004	I	83	“ Is it always like that ? ”
88008	88011	88012	88012	She	453	“ Yep . ”
88036	88048	88049	88049	They	1910	“ Keisha , my darling . So good to see you . ”
88059	88090	88055	88055	Keisha	453	“ Begonia , Hyacinth , this is Cecily . She ’s a goddess , and she ’s going to find us the perfect dresses for the Windsor Gala tomorrow night . ”
88091	88100	88101	88101	Cecily	275	“ Lovely to meet you , my angels . ”
88125	88136	88055	88055	Keisha	453	“ Come , come . I have the perfect gowns . ”
88137	88148	88149	88149	Hyacinth	83	“ Oh , I do n’t think I ’m going , ”
88159	88170	88152	88152	She	83	“ I mean , not that you thought I was . ”
88174	88183	88171	88171	Cecily	275	“ I dressed Emma Roberts during her pregnancy . ”
88184	88210	88211	88211	Keisha	453	“ And I have Hayes ’s credit card , and it would make Begonia ’s day to know that you ’re doing dishes in Versace , ”
88214	88221	88222	88222	Hy	197	“ You could go TikTok famous . ”
88403	88427	88398	88398	I	83	“ Hayes would want you to . I want you to . Keisha ’s right . You ’d rock the dishes in Versace . ”
88449	88458	88459	88459	Hyacinth	83	“ I have died and gone to heaven , ”
88715	88718	88719	88719	Hyacinth	83	“ Begonia ? ”
88727	88743	88722	88722	I	83	“ You ’re going to be the most gorgeous diaper - changer in the world . ”
88744	88762	88763	88763	Keisha	453	“ We ’re totes getting you the seamstress package so you can have the dress refitted after … ”
88770	88775	88763	88763	Keisha	453	“ Well , after . ”
88849	88857	88859	88859	Hayes	2931	“ Let ’s go have some fun . ”
89209	89231	89205	89205	she	83	“ Hayes ! You ’re home ! Guess what ? I made a bowl that looks like a bowl this morning . ”
89370	89373	89363	89363	she	83	“ Wow , ”
89377	89393	89394	89394	I	83	“ You should keep this one , B. I ’m getting turned on just watching . ”
89423	89434	89435	89435	she	83	“ It ’s like having two Keishas in the house , ”
89438	89459	89460	89460	Begonia	83	“ I have another house in the Hamptons . We can be there alone by eight if we leave now . ”
89463	89469	89460	89460	Begonia	83	“ Of course you do . ”
89470	89480	89481	89481	Hyacinth	83	“ Hello , Mr. Billionaire . You invited me . ”
89500	89504	89505	89505	Begonia	83	“ No arguing , ”
89521	89533	89515	89515	She	83	“ Not when you ’re abandoning me right before this ball . ”
89544	89656	89541	89541	She	83	“ I miss my babies and my husband and my bed and I kinda ca n’t wait to walk through my front door looking like a fucking queen . Plus , this dress is totes amazeballs , but I ’d spend half the night tugging it up and down to pee , and I ’ve needed to tell Jerry he ’s getting snipped for a while , and what better time than now , when I can walk through my front door and start issuing orders like I ’m the love child of Martha Stewart and Cleopatra ? Begonia swore you would n’t mind if I took the dress and ran . ”
89686	89695	89683	89683	I	83	“ Correct . Enjoy the dress and run . ”
89718	89730	89731	89731	she	83	“ It ’s not as bad as she makes it sound , ”
89738	89760	89735	89735	Hyacinth	83	“ B , you ca n’t tell a man that . It ’s always as bad as we make it sound . ”
89761	89766	89767	89767	I	83	“ Speaking of bad , ”
89770	89781	89767	89767	I	83	“ Begonia , have you been to a gala before ? ”
89782	89801	89735	89735	Hyacinth	83	“ In Richmond with Chad . Kind of . Not in New York with the Gossip Girl crowds . ”
89802	89814	89735	89735	Hyacinth	83	“ If you ’ve seen Gossip Girl , you ’re prepared . ”
89815	89822	89823	89823	Hyacinth	83	“ She has n’t seen it , ”
89826	89864	89865	89865	I	83	“ She quit reading the gossip magazines because she was upset when some celebrity went into rehab and it was all the headlines were about for months , and Gossip Girl was like an extension of that . ”
89891	89900	89901	89901	Begonia	83	“ Mr. Rutherford , we need to finish , ”
90440	90449	90450	90450	Hyacinth	83	“ Aww , B , he ’s speechless , ”
90482	90489	90490	90490	she	83	“ Makeup does this every time , ”
90500	90517	90490	90490	she	83	“ Right ? Remember freshman homecoming ? You were batting them off like maggots on poop . ”
90518	90521	90522	90526	The brown - haired twin	1970	“ Hyacinth . ”
90627	90630	90631	90631	she	83	“ Hayes ? ”
90648	90654	90631	90631	she	83	“ We ’re not going , ”
90675	90678	90669	90669	she	83	“ No ? ”
90679	90751	90752	90752	I	83	“ You ’ll outshine the host , though you ’ll have her eating out of the palm of your hand within minutes , and then the vultures will descend and they wo n’t stop with what ’s in your hand , but rather they ’ll attempt to eat you alive . You do n’t belong to this crowd , Begonia . They ’re too cutthroat , and you ’re too perfect . ”
90782	90831	90774	90774	She	83	“ Hayes . We ’re going , and I ’m going to try caviar and hate it and dribble it down my dress and horrify your crowd , which is perfect , since you hate hanging out with them , and then they wo n’t invite you back . ”
90842	90881	90774	90774	She	83	“ You two are seriously a match made in heaven . Also , call me when the caviar thing happens so I can talk you down . It will not be as bad as you think it is . ”
90889	90904	90882	90882	Begonia	83	“ What if I spill red wine on someone wearing a dress like yours ? ”
90905	90914	90915	90915	Hyacinth	83	“ Then Hayes will come to your rescue , ”
90918	90953	90954	90955	The stylist	1975	“ And he gets out of ever going to these things again . Why do n’t you like these things , Hayes ? Are they terrible ? Or is this just not your crowd ? ”
90983	91004	91005	91005	Begonia	83	“ Hyacinth , would you like to spend your days doing nothing more than operating the preschool ’s parent club ? ”
91011	91016	91008	91008	She	83	“ Hush your mouth . ”
91017	91040	91056	91056	I	83	“ High society is to Hayes what preschool parent club is to you . Great for some , but not for all . ”
91041	91055	91056	91056	I	83	“ Oh , jeez . At least my kids will eventually outgrow preschool . ”
91073	91081	91082	91082	she	83	“ Will Liliane or Amelia be there ? ”
91101	91112	91092	91092	I	83	“ My world is not ready for you , Begonia . ”
91113	91128	91135	91135	Robert	1310	“ Keisha operates in your world . They are more than ready for me . ”
91139	91147	91135	91135	Robert	1310	“ The helicopter is ready , sir . ”
91148	91158	91159	91159	Hyacinth	83	“ Oh my god , take all the pictures ! ”
91166	91194	91161	91161	Begonia	83	“ And can I pee before we get on the helicopter ? I ca n’t hug you after I pee or I might have to pee again . ”
91211	91219	91220	91220	Hyacinth	83	“ Go on . We ’ll wait . ”
91257	91265	91239	91239	I	83	“ You are breathtakingly gorgeous this evening . ”
91266	91284	91246	91246	Begonia	83	“ We do n’t have to go if you do n’t want to , but I thought … ”
91285	91312	91239	91239	I	83	“ Whatever you thought , you thought correctly . We do , unfortunately , have to go . What ’s this scent ? It ’s intoxicating . ”
91313	91318	91239	91239	I	83	“ You like it ? ”
91319	91329	91246	91246	Begonia	83	“ I ’m enraptured . You wear it well . ”
91330	91356	91239	91239	I	83	“ Keisha gave it to me . She ’s working on a secret project to take over the world with beauty products on the side . ”
91357	91360	91239	91239	I	83	“ Hm . ”
91361	91364	91246	91246	Begonia	83	“ Hm ? ”
91365	91382	91383	91383	Begonia	83	“ She ’ll overcharge me exorbitantly to buy the scent so only you can wear it . ”
91396	91405	91386	91386	she	83	“ Oh my god , you ’re serious . ”
91406	91437	91438	91438	My	83	“ If I have to endure society and people because of my family ’s success , I may as well reap the benefits of a private perfume for my girlfriend . ”
92423	92436	92404	92404	Hayes	156	“ Hayes Rutherford . Living up to your potential , I see . ”
92520	92526	92501	92501	He	2931	“ Sturgis . Mrs. Sturgis . ”
92591	92604	92584	92584	I	83	“ I see they ’re letting anyone into these things these days , ”
92698	92701	92702	92702	I	83	“ Hi ! ”
92735	92771	92726	92726	I	83	“ I ’m Begonia . Lovely to meet you . I mean , as lovely as it can be , given who you are . Your hair is gorgeous . That must ’ve taken forever . ”
92884	92894	92895	92898	Trixie Melhoff - Sturgis	253	“ I see you ’re borrowing the Rutherford jewels , ”
92961	92987	92988	92988	Sturgis	253	“ The jewels are a dime a dozen in this crowd , are n’t they ? But the man — Hayes is the real treasure . ”
92991	93001	92988	92988	Sturgis	253	“ He ’s not worth the bitcoin I mine . ”
93008	93046	92988	92988	Sturgis	253	“ Are you — are you for real ? Do people like you actually say things like that ? Oh , sweetie . Good luck with your virtual seven dwarves operation . Excuse us . There ’s — ”
93059	93067	93047	93047	I	83	“ Someone we need to go see , ”
93173	93181	93182	93182	he	2931	“ Do not ever change , Begonia , ”
93185	93210	93182	93182	he	2931	“ Was I mean enough ? I ’m so bad at mean . But I hated them on sight . Why are they here ? ”
93211	93214	93182	93182	he	2931	“ Gossip . ”
93215	93232	93182	93182	he	2931	“ For the record , Hayes Rutherford , I am very pissed at you right now . ”
93233	93238	93182	93182	he	2931	“ What ? Why ? ”
93239	93347	93348	93348	I	83	“ Because I do n’t want you to be related to a movie star that I had a massive crush on for half of my life . I want you to be normal so that I do n’t look like I ’m only dating you to get close to your brother , because I do n’t care who you ’re related to , except for the part where I wish it was n’t him . You really are the jewel here . But oh my god , do you have any idea how much Hyacinth would be wetting herself right now even if she were n’t pregnant ? ”
93405	93426	93396	93396	I	83	“ I ’ll give you five million dollars if you ’ll hug Jonas like you ’re long - lost siblings . ”
93427	93438	93391	93391	he	2931	“ I do n’t want your money , you goober . ”
93439	93462	93396	93396	I	83	“ Forgive me , love . It ’s been a rough three minutes . But please , sell it well , bluebell . ”
93535	93551	93529	93529	he	2037	“ Hayes ! And Begonia . Nice of you to stop by to say hi . ”
93574	93578	93579	93579	he	404	“ Go on , ”
93593	93604	93590	93590	I	83	“ Jonas ! What are you doing back here already ? ”
93724	93732	93733	93733	Jonas	404	“ So good to see you again , ”
93833	93842	93843	93843	Hayes	2931	“ Kindly remove your hands from my girlfriend , ”
93849	93857	93858	93858	Jonas	404	“ But she gives the best hugs , ”
93861	93872	93873	93873	I	83	“ You ’re decent , but you ’re no Hayes , ”
94120	94126	94127	94127	he	2931	“ You ’re back early , ”
94132	94139	94127	94127	he	2931	“ Peyton loves the sea lions . ”
94140	94153	94154	94154	They	2058	“ Who would n’t ? They ’re such cute bundles of flub . ”
94181	94206	94176	94176	Hayes	2931	“ Not nearly so much as you , bluebell . Minus the flub , though you ’d be absolutely perfect with or without it . ”
94245	94251	94232	94232	his	2931	“ Are you enjoying this ? ”
94270	94279	94280	94280	he	2931	“ I enjoy everything about you , Begonia , ”
94284	94287	94280	94280	he	2931	“ Everything . ”
94337	94340	94341	94341	Amelia	81	“ Begonia . ”
94386	94389	94381	94381	I	83	“ Amelia ! ”
94432	94440	94441	94441	I	83	“ Um , good to see you , ”
94518	94528	94529	94529	she	81	“ You ’re quite the breath of fresh air , ”
94553	94561	94544	94544	she	81	“ These events are rarely so entertaining . ”
94638	94650	94651	94651	I	83	“ I thought that ’s what the sea lions were for , ”
94654	94658	94651	94651	I	83	“ For entertainment . ”
94659	94677	94627	94627	she	81	“ You get tired of them after the first seven galas of the year with them present . ”
94678	94687	94651	94651	I	83	“ Oh my gosh , I could never — ”
94688	94695	94696	94696	Amelia	81	“ I ’m aware , Begonia , ”
94713	94734	94705	94705	her	81	“ I only wish I could ’ve counted on you to slice and dice Brock and Trixie Sturgis ’s livers . ”
94735	94754	94755	94755	She	81	“ I tried , but I do n’t know if they were smart enough to get the insults . ”
94819	94834	94835	94835	she	81	“ Shall I send yours back once my assistant has solved this little issue ? ”
94876	94886	94887	94887	he	2931	“ Begonia would love to have her necklace back , ”
94890	94894	94887	94887	he	2931	“ Thank you . ”
94895	94898	94899	94899	Peyton	270	“ Begonia ! ”
94983	95011	94965	94965	she	2069	“ We were so sorry to miss you at the wedding , but completely understood . I ’m so glad you ’re here . How ’s Hyacinth ? ”
95012	95041	95042	95043	Peyton Baker	270	“ She ’s like a Thanksgiving turkey with her popper thingie stuck in the wing instead of the thigh . Ready to pop , but not fully baked . ”
95203	95211	95212	95212	Peyton	270	“ We ’re so excited for her , ”
95215	95222	95212	95212	Peyton	270	“ And where ’s Marshmallow tonight ? ”
95223	95246	95247	95247	Jonas	404	“ H - Hayes assigned Nikolay to guard him so he does n’t ruin Françoise ’s kitchen or redecorate the family portraits . ”
95250	95257	95247	95247	Jonas	404	“ I love that furry beast . ”
95258	95266	95267	95267	Hayes	2931	“ He ’s worth the daily Benadryl . ”
95357	95367	95368	95368	Peyton	270	“ Have you gotten to explore the city yet ? ”
95377	95384	95372	95372	I	83	“ Just a little with Keisha . ”
95418	95424	95425	95425	I	83	“ And what about you ? ”
95428	95434	95435	95435	Her	83	“ How was the honeymoon ? ”
95442	95455	95435	95435	Her	83	“ Everything we needed it to be , though unfortunately too short . ”
95456	95465	95466	95466	Jonas	404	“ We ’ll take another one at Christmas , ”
95470	95477	95478	95478	Amelia	81	“ You should try the Maldives , ”
95493	95500	95478	95478	Amelia	81	“ They ’re beautiful at Christmas . ”
95501	95515	95516	95516	Peyton	270	“ Thank you . We ’ll add that to the list to consider . ”
95591	95595	95596	95596	Hayes	2931	“ Excuse us , ”
95604	95616	95596	95596	Hayes	2931	“ I promised Begonia front - row seats to the feeding . ”
95617	95628	95629	95629	Amelia	81	“ You wo n’t really have to fight the crowd , ”
95632	95638	95639	95639	Peyton	270	“ Do they do tricks ? ”
95642	95704	95705	95705	They	2090	“ We ’ll come with you . Jonas . Where ’s your phone ? Show Begonia the video of the sea lions from our trip to San Francisco when we were filming Deep in Love . Amelia , so good to see you again . Have your assistant ping mine . We ’ll do lunch next time I ’m in town . ”
95944	95955	95956	95956	Hayes	2931	“ Do you think they know how lucky they are ? ”
95980	95988	95956	95956	Hayes	2931	“ The zookeeper or the sea lions ? ”
95989	95992	95993	95993	I	83	“ Yes . ”
96013	96018	96019	96019	I	83	“ I hope so , ”
96055	96072	96073	96073	he	2931	“ The interminable self - congratulating about saving a single sea turtle is about to begin , ”
96076	96081	96073	96073	he	2931	“ Come with me . ”
96198	96212	96213	96213	I	83	“ How many times have you disappeared to hide at events like this ? ”
96216	96222	96213	96213	I	83	“ All of the times . ”
96223	96226	96213	96213	I	83	“ Oh . ”
96227	96230	96213	96213	I	83	“ Oh ? ”
96231	96252	96253	96253	He	2931	“ I thought you wanted to sneak away and be alone with me and do something naughty but absolutely irresistible . ”
96265	96285	96253	96253	He	2931	“ Bluebell , for the first time in my life , that ’s exactly what I want to do , ”
96385	96392	96393	96393	he	2931	“ Fuck , I needed this , ”
96396	96402	96403	96403	He	2931	“ Your crowd is hard . ”
96421	96429	96430	96430	I	83	“ Not as hard as I am . ”
96442	96462	96430	96430	I	83	“ You ca n’t possibly go through the rest of the night like this . Whatever shall we do ? ”
96463	96466	96467	96467	I	83	“ Begonia — ”
96473	96482	96467	96467	I	83	“ Shh . Everyone ’s at the party . ”
96483	96497	96430	96430	I	83	“ Just when I think you ca n’t possibly get any more perfect . ”
96498	96512	96430	96430	I	83	“ There are n’t any reporters stalking in the bushes , are there ? ”
96513	96521	96467	96467	I	83	“ Not if they want to live . ”
96522	96525	96430	96430	I	83	“ Security ? ”
96526	96537	96430	96430	I	83	“ Even if we ’re caught , they ’re discreet . ”
96562	96567	96554	96554	He	2931	“ Wo n’t work , ”
96605	96613	96584	96584	He	2931	“ Sweet holy fuck , your hands . ”
96614	96624	96625	96625	He	2931	“ You have the loveliest penis in the world . ”
96640	96654	96625	96625	He	2931	“ Your compliments are beyond compare . Dear god , do that again . ”
96800	96805	96806	96806	he	2931	“ Jesus , Begonia , ”
97037	97040	97041	97041	he	2931	“ Begonia , ”
97111	97114	97115	97115	he	2931	“ Fuck , ”
97156	97165	97152	97152	he	2931	“ Cameras . Hand them over . Now . ”
97173	97185	97186	97187	a guy	2113	“ Holy shit , it ’s really the weird Rutherford brother , ”
97202	97211	97198	97198	Hayes	2931	“ I said , hand over your cameras . ”
97212	97225	97226	97226	He	2931	“ Not a fucking chance , bro . Thanks for the shot . ”
97255	97258	97259	97259	he	2931	“ Robert , ”
97277	97283	97271	97271	he	2931	“ We have a problem . ”
97329	97336	97337	97337	I	83	“ The damage will be minimal , ”
97349	97370	97371	97371	She	83	“ The paparazzi know my family will pay a pretty penny to squash scandal . My team is on it . ”
97379	97387	97371	97371	She	83	“ Of course . That makes sense . ”
97388	97394	97371	97371	She	83	“ We should get married . ”
97792	97797	97779	97779	She	83	“ We should what ? ”
97798	97900	97901	97901	She	83	“ My lawyer will draft a prenup before we land that will provide a comfortable stipend for you regardless of what happens next . I require at least two full years of marriage in exchange for supporting you in whatever endeavors would make you happiest , from teaching to making your own artwork to exploring anything else that would fill your heart with joy , and at the end of two years , if you ’ve found someone else you would rather be with , I ’ll grant you a quiet divorce with assistance for transition back to a normal life . ”
98109	98213	98214	98214	Her	2143	“ I ’ll do my best to charm your mother , though of course , it ’s in everyone ’s best interest if she abhors me . That will make our eventual split easier on you . And I work long hours , as you ’ve clearly realized , so if you wanted to live and work in Richmond as you ’ve been doing , I could commute back to New York during the week , keep my own quarters near you on the weekend , and be as little of an inconvenience in your life as you ’d like me to be . ”
98224	98231	98219	98219	her	2143	“ That ’s what you want . ”
98232	98287	98214	98214	Her	2143	“ It ’s what must happen , Begonia . I ca n’t be the cause of scandal to my family , especially given my new position in the company , and I do n’t know if my influence alone will be enough for you to keep your teaching job if those photos appear anywhere . ”
98337	98342	98343	98343	she	2143	“ Take me home , ”
98350	98353	98343	98343	she	2143	“ Begonia — ”
98354	98361	98343	98343	she	2143	“ Take . Me . Home . ”
98362	98371	98343	98343	she	2143	“ This is the only clear way to — ”
98372	98561	98570	98570	she	2145	“ I love you , Hayes . I. Love . You . And I do n’t want to . I did n’t want to . I just got divorced . I do n’t fit in your world . I ’m still finding myself again . And I could roll with it . I could . You ’re supposed to love people . That ’s what makes the world a better place . And you ’ve been nothing but everything I always dreamed I wanted in a partner , except for one thing . You do n’t love me back . I ’ve spent too many years sacrificing what I deserve for what I thought should ’ve been good enough . I wo n’t do good enough with you . I wo n’t do easy with you . Or anyone . I will not settle for anything less than all - consuming , no - holding - back , nothing - else - matters , we - are - in - this - together , I - love - you - so - much - it - hurts love . ”
98828	98836	98837	98837	she	2145	“ Do you love me , Hayes ? ”
98840	98846	98837	98837	she	2145	“ Could you love me ? ”
98857	98877	98837	98837	she	2145	“ Begonia , I know very few people in this world who could know you and not love you . ”
98878	98885	98837	98837	she	2145	“ But do you love me ? ”
99046	99049	99050	99050	she	83	“ Hayes ? ”
99056	99066	99053	99053	I	83	“ I ’ll instruct the pilot to change course . ”
99289	99296	99297	99297	Hyacinth	83	“ Who ’s a good boy ? ”
99300	99328	99329	99329	I	83	“ Marshmallow is such a good boy . Where ’s the potty , Marshmallow ? Where ’s the potty before I pee on your mommy ’s carpet ? ”
99332	99337	99329	99329	I	83	“ Oh , B , ”
99342	99353	99354	99354	She	2705	“ Do n’t move . I ’ll be right back . ”
99400	99407	99408	99408	I	83	“ So it was all fake . ”
99414	99417	99418	99418	She	2705	“ What ? ”
99426	99439	99440	99440	Heat	292	“ You signed a contract to fake being his girlfriend . Why ? ”
99468	99471	99459	99459	I	83	“ What ? ”
99472	99540	99541	99541	I	83	“ That ’s your signature . I know your signature . How did they get your signature if it was fake ? And you were supposed to get engaged ? What did you do ? And talk fast , because I guarantee you , this is hitting the morning shows locally any minute , and Mom will be here like she can teleport the minute it does . ”
99616	99619	99620	99620	I	83	“ No , ”
99623	99702	99620	99620	I	83	“ Begonia . Ignore the picture . Also , anyone who comes after you for having sex in public will have to go through me first , because hello , that had to be hella fucking hot . But we need to talk about this headline . The Weird Rutherford Fakes A Girlfriend . And this contract that they printed . And how I ’m going to murder everyone in the Rutherford family for using you like this . ”
99703	99706	99620	99620	I	83	“ No . ”
99707	99730	99620	99620	I	83	“ Begonia , they have the signed NDA printed in here too . Talk . Now . I knew something was up . ”
99731	99734	99620	99620	I	83	“ How ? ”
99735	99740	99620	99620	I	83	“ Hello , twinstinct ? ”
99741	99751	99620	99620	I	83	“ No , how do they have the contract ? ”
99752	99819	99620	99620	I	83	“ So you ’d take the fall for the BJ that ’s threatening to destroy the Rutherford family ’s reputation . Duh . I really hope he did a lot more than setting up the most gorgeous art room I ’ve ever seen for you in that mansion of his , because otherwise , his death will be slow and painful instead of quick and merciful . ”
99820	99827	99828	99828	I	83	“ Hy , he would n’t — ”
100153	100166	100167	100167	she	83	“ Jerry says he can get you a job at his company , ”
100170	100212	100213	100213	I	83	“ Just until all of this blows over . To keep you busy , I mean . Until you sue the ever - loving fuck out of that asshole billionaire who ’s letting you take the fall for all of this . ”
100219	100230	100213	100213	I	83	“ Despite it all , Hy , I love him . ”
100231	100359	100167	100167	she	83	“ Begonia , you could fall in love with a turd - coated shape - shifting lemur . I realize Mr. Big Bucks was a little more handsome than that , and he gave us a good run of thinking he knew you and liked you , but sweetie , he betrayed you in the freaking gossip rags to save his family ’s reputation , and you are going to be okay . C’m on , Ms. Things Happen For A Reason . You can do private art lessons now . Take advantage of the notoriety and get a page up on Etsy with some of your attempts at spin - art . Sign them , and they ’ll be worth like , seven times as much . ”
100360	100394	100213	100213	I	83	“ I hate math , but even I know seven times zero is zero . And I do n’t care , Hy . I do n’t . I do n’t care about anything . ”
100395	100402	100213	100213	I	83	“ You fed your dog today . ”
100403	100415	100416	100416	She	2193	“ I fed him the whole bag when we got home . ”
100431	100447	100416	100416	She	2193	“ Oh . I , ah , see . Does he need to go out ? ”
100448	100461	100462	100462	He	2194	“ Every freaking hour , but he takes care of it himself . ”
100472	100475	100462	100462	He	2194	“ Begonia . ”
100476	100558	100213	100213	I	83	“ I ’ve cleaned up seven thousand dog messes in the park from other dogs ! If he makes a dozen messes that I do n’t clean while I ’m heartbroken and drowning my sorrows on my couch , then I do n’t care . And if my dog is smart enough to take the elevator down to the parking lot to poop , then find his way back , then why should n’t he have his freedom to do that ? ”
100559	100589	100416	100416	She	2193	“ Okay . Okay . I ’m texting Jerry . He ’ll do the whole apartment parking lot . He does n’t mind . He ’s worried about you . ”
100590	100594	100462	100462	He	2194	“ You settled . ”
100595	100598	100213	100213	I	83	“ What ? ”
100599	100617	100416	100416	She	2193	“ For Jerry . You settled . I do n’t want to settle . I want love . ”
100618	100632	100462	100462	He	2194	“ Oh my god , Begonia . I did not settle for Jerry . ”
100633	100673	100213	100213	I	83	“ But you complain about him all the time . And the last time he took you on a date was months ago , and it was popcorn and hotdogs in your basement while you hid from the kids . ”
100674	100685	100686	100686	She	2195	“ Um , hello , that was a good date . ”
100699	101020	101021	101021	I	83	“ Too good , unfortunately . And I ’m sorry I complain about him too much . It ’s not him . Exactly . It ’s raising two and a half minions and being overwhelmed and settling into — no , not settling , not like that — but just having routines and being so busy and forgetting to appreciate all the reasons I fell in love with him in the first place . Like , he gives me foot rubs every night . And he takes the kids to the park every Saturday morning so I can have one morning of bingeing adult TV while I drink my coffee hot . And do you remember when the preschool moms all rose up last year to protest Dani saying fuck ? Jerry was the first one to tell me that our kids will be just fine , because they wo n’t be afraid of profanity and they ’ll understand how and when to use it and that people are different and see things differently , and he went to the preschool meeting for me and read a list of cuss words and their etymology and talked about how when you stigmatize something , that makes it worse than it is all on its own . And he does n’t blink when I drink pickle smoothies or have ice cream dribble down my shirt , and he buys me tampons . I know he ’s not , like , a billionaire who can take me to Europe on a moment ’s notice — which I notice the billionaire who shall not be named did n’t do for you , by the way , despite teasing you incessantly about it — or get me tickets to a movie premiere or send me luxury chocolates every day , but he ’s my prince charming , even when I forget how much he does . ”
101079	101086	101087	101087	I	83	“ I thought he loved me , ”
101093	101108	101087	101087	I	83	“ Underneath it all , I thought he was falling in love with me . ”
101127	101134	101124	101124	I	83	“ And now Mom ’s here . ”
101135	101172	101173	101173	Marshmallow	84	“ If she says the Chad word , I ’ll threaten to never let her see her grandbabies again , and I swear on my loyalty to you above everyone else , I ’ll mean it . ”
101177	101180	101181	101181	Mom	2159	“ Begonia ? ”
101184	101199	101200	101200	I	83	“ Sweetie , open the door . Mommy ’s here to fix it all . ”
101231	101238	101239	101239	Mom	2159	“ Honey , do n’t worry , ”
101242	101264	101239	101239	Mom	2159	“ I brought Chad , and he forgives you . Let ’s put this all behind us now , shall we ? ”
101298	101307	101308	101308	Hyacinth	83	“ I ’m going to murder them both , ”
101365	101370	101349	101349	she	2159	“ Begon — erp . ”
101371	101374	101375	101375	Hy	197	“ Out , ”
101378	101499	101500	101500	Keisha	453	“ Out , out , out . Mother , you ’re dead to me . Chad , you ’ll be dead for real if you do n’t march your loser ass out of this apartment and stay the fuck away . You do n’t get to realize what you lost after it ’s gone . You get to wallow in misery for the rest of your freaking forever . No , Mother , dead to me . Go . Go . Before I call Keisha Kourtney and ask her to take Begonia somewhere safe where none of us can ever bother her again , and that means none of us will ever see her again too . Do you understand ? ”
101717	101743	101744	101744	he	480	“ While this has all the makings of a quality Razzle Dazzle film , I did n’t expect you ’d do it in real life , ”
101808	101836	101837	101837	She	299	“ Maybe next time , use a digital document instead of paper . Especially if your fake girlfriend is n’t tech - savvy enough to forward it . ”
101866	101872	101873	101873	My	83	“ I ’ll issue apologies . ”
101882	101890	101873	101873	My	83	“ If you need me to resign — ”
101891	101922	101873	101873	My	83	“ We ’re held to a ridiculous standard , Hayes . If our family looks merely mortal in the press from time to time , we ’ll weather the storm . ”
101923	101933	101873	101873	My	83	“ This is n’t mortal . This is embarrassing . ”
101942	101948	101949	101950	my father	480	“ It will blow over , ”
101994	102055	102056	102056	He	480	“ For nearly forty damn years , I ’ve bent over backwards to keep from smearing our family ’s name , and now , with a photo of me getting a goddamn blow job on the front page of every tabloid , accompanied by a goddamn fake relationship contract , all you have to say is it ’ll blow over ? ”
102105	102116	102097	102097	he	480	“ You do n’t enjoy working here , do you ? ”
102117	102125	102126	102126	I	83	“ Did you fucking set me up ? ”
102185	102199	102200	102200	He	480	“ Did you set me up so I ’d have to step down ? ”
102229	102273	102274	102274	Begonia	299	“ Of course not . But since Thomas passed … you’ve been different . Some good . Some not so good . I do n’t know what makes you happy , and your mother and I have been negligent by failing to ask . ”
102338	102346	102347	102347	I	83	“ It ’s been a difficult time , ”
102351	102357	102358	102358	He	480	“ I ’ll be fine . ”
102374	102383	102358	102358	He	480	“ That ’s quite the balance sheet collection . ”
102384	102389	102358	102358	He	480	“ I like puzzles . ”
102390	102397	102358	102358	He	480	“ Especially when you ’re unhappy . ”
102398	102403	102404	102404	I	83	“ I ’m not — ”
102572	102588	102559	102559	I	83	“ I do n’t know that I ’m built to be Razzle Dazzle ’s CFO . ”
102589	102593	102559	102559	I	83	“ Because … ? ”
102605	102629	102630	102630	He	480	“ Interviews . Shareholder meetings . Managing a team . People . And I hate every goddamn movie this family has ever produced . ”
102636	102646	102630	102630	He	480	“ They ’re dreadfully repetitive , are n’t they ? ”
102653	102661	102649	102649	I	83	“ You do n’t like them either ? ”
102662	102696	102697	102697	Jesus	234	“ Oh , no , I enjoy them , but we have n’t taken a risk since we opened Razzle Dazzle Village when you were a baby . And you ’re getting old . ”
102713	102722	102723	102723	Begonia	299	“ What would make you happy , Hayes ? ”
102744	102878	102879	102879	He	2224	“ Son , life ’s too short to spend it doing nothing but making other people happy . And god knows we parents get it wrong on occasion when it comes to guessing what that might be . If you ’re under the impression we expect you to pay us back for anything we ’ve ever given you in life , let me assure you , all we want is for you to do what makes you happy . Not what makes us happy . And it ’s time I put my money where my mouth is , so consider that this offer is as much for me as it is for you . If you ’re not happy , if you want out … now ’s the time to take a leap . ”
102889	102894	102885	102885	He	2224	“ Are you ill ? ”
102895	102912	102913	102913	I	83	“ No , merely disgusted with myself for taking the easy path for far too long . ”
102920	102932	102933	102933	He	2224	“ Our first film featuring a queer couple is nearly finished . ”
102940	103161	102933	102933	He	2224	“ We ’ve done the same thing for so long that we ’ve convinced ourselves the audience would n’t follow us if we added additional paths , and it ’s time we move away from the fear and embrace the possibilities of truly living up to what our reputation should be . Not a surface - level happy family , but a family of love and support and acceptance . The account sheets will be corrected when we announce it next week . Thomas was aware and had signed off on the various accounting tricks we needed to use for developing the project in complete secret . The rest of the board is ready to handle the media requests we would ’ve had him do , as we ’ve wanted to give you time to settle in before fully feeding you to the sharks . But Hayes , if this is n’t where your heart is — and I do n’t mean the company ’s growth and expansion into new markets that we should ’ve ventured into before this , but I mean you , in this chair — no one will think any less of you . I ’d hoped this job would be an opportunity , but I fear I ’ve actually put you into an obligation instead . ”
103232	103237	103238	103239	my father	480	“ Think it over , ”
103242	103282	103238	103239	my father	480	“ If you ’re not happy , Hayes … let us help you find what would help you get there . And in the meantime , do n’t let anyone else walk through your door with tabloids in hand . ”
103283	103298	103238	103239	my father	480	“ You just walked through my door with that infernal tabloid in your hand . ”
103299	103310	103311	103311	He	480	“ I ’m your father . It comes with privileges . ”
103320	103334	103311	103311	He	480	“ But the biggest is worry . The biggest is always the worry . ”
103335	103340	103238	103239	my father	480	“ I ’m fine . ”
103341	103345	103311	103311	He	480	“ Are you ? ”
103346	103351	103352	103352	He	480	“ As can be . ”
103373	103380	103361	103361	I	83	“ Toss this , would you ? ”
103381	103396	103397	103397	he	480	“ Never thought she ’d be the type to take that to the press , ”
103400	103406	103397	103397	he	480	“ Her dog , though … ”
103439	103446	103447	103447	He	480	“ We ’re not discussing this . ”
103450	103461	103447	103447	He	480	“ Happiness is n’t something you can plan , son . ”
103462	103469	103470	103470	He	480	“ We ’re not discussing this . ”
103950	103989	103990	103990	I	83	“ You ’re a difficult woman to track down when your hair is n’t glowing brighter than the sun . The black is striking , but I oddly think I prefer the neon burgundy . It fits you . ”
104018	104032	104033	104033	I	83	“ You ’re here to deliver a massive lawsuit , are n’t you ? ”
104122	104125	104126	104126	Giovanna	135	“ Begonia . ”
104169	104185	104165	104165	my	83	“ No , my sweet . I ’m here because I owe you an apology . ”
104186	104192	104193	104193	I	83	“ This is not helping , ”
104196	104205	104193	104193	I	83	“ You know about Trixie , I presume . ”
104246	104280	104281	104281	I	83	“ You probably do n’t know about Melinda , Cricket , Elizabeth , Victoria , Emma , Sophia , Emma , Emma , Sophie , Emma , Ella , Odette , and Leah . ”
104302	104315	104316	104316	Giovanna	135	“ I thought by the fourth Emma , he would ’ve learned , ”
104320	104494	104316	104316	Giovanna	135	“ but he put his heart out there for every last girl in high school to see , and for so long , he kept insisting that not every woman only wanted to be near him for his family connections , to get closer to Jonas , to ask about a job or an internship with the company , to get a ride to school in our family car every morning , to get flowers delivered weekly , or sometimes diamonds and pearls and exotic chocolates , or whatever in the world her little heart would tell him she secretly yearned for from a store . He even sent a girlfriend a hand - crafted German grandfather clock once . That young man put every ounce of his heart into every relationship he had , especially once that awful Sturgis boy decided to make his life a living hell in high school . He just wanted to believe that there was good in the world and that he could find it in relationships . ”
104495	104498	104499	104499	She	2254	“ Hayes ? ”
104502	104505	104499	104499	She	2254	“ Hayes . ”
104530	104692	104523	104528	the boy who believed in love	2255	“ He ’ll tell you now that he saw that three of the Emmas and Cricket and Leah flirted more with Jonas than they did with him , and that he kept dating them to give them something no one else could . That Ella and Odette were only in it for the gifts , and that the rest of them got off on dating the weird Rutherford with the big trust fund and Razzle Dazzle Village season tickets . But he did n’t at the time . He took a long time to grow into his looks , he did n’t have the societal advantage of Jonas ’s natural charm — and I say that as his mother who thinks he ’s utterly perfect exactly the way he is — but he ’d cut his teeth watching Razzle Dazzle films , and that child believed in the power of love . He believed so hard in the power of love . ”
104693	104701	104523	104528	the boy who believed in love	2255	“ You remember all of their names . ”
104702	104722	104723	104723	I	83	“ You will too one day , Begonia . If not for your own children , for Hyacinth ’s . ”
104731	104748	104749	104749	I	83	“ A little kid named Aiden shoved my niece Dani on the playground two months ago , ”
104757	104762	104752	104752	She	83	“ You ’ll remember . ”
104763	104793	104752	104752	She	83	“ Why are you here ? Not to be rude , but — Hayes dumped me , and then he told the whole world we were fake , and — ”
104794	104801	104752	104752	She	83	“ No , he did n’t . ”
104802	104806	104807	104807	She	83	“ Then who — ”
104837	104840	104841	104841	I	83	“ No , ”
104844	104873	104841	104841	I	83	“ Begonia , that dog brought me your signed contract the first night that I was in Maine . I put it back in your luggage for you . ”
104874	104878	104879	104879	I	83	“ You knew , ”
104882	104925	104926	104926	I	83	“ I suspected from the minute I laid eyes on you . I knew a few hours after that . What I did n’t know was what you were hoping to get out of the proximity to my son and my family . ”
104942	105011	104926	104926	I	83	“ Something new . Anything but my old life . I did n’t want to fall in love . I just got out of a relationship that was — well , it was lacking . I wanted an adventure . I wanted to live without being told I could n’t do the simplest things that sounded fun . I wanted to find myself . Not lose myself again . ”
105012	105017	105018	105018	I	83	“ Are you lost ? ”
105023	105035	105018	105018	I	83	“ No . I ’m not lost . I ’m sad . ”
105036	105047	105048	105048	Giovanna	135	“ Hayes was never the same after Trixie and Brock , ”
105052	105223	105048	105048	Giovanna	135	“ I thought he ’d come back out of his shell . That I ’d see my boy again , the one who believed in the goodness of the world , who had hope , who had so much love to give , but he closed himself off so hard . It was three years before he dated anyone again , and the minute he so much as suspected someone wanted him for anything other than himself , she was out the door . He ’d bring the occasional date to an event , but I always assumed it was more to give meddling family members or the press something to talk about than it was because he truly enjoyed his date ’s company . He was keenly aware that if he was spotted in public with a woman , he ’d be labeled a playboy if he was spotted with a different woman anytime in a six - month window after that . He used it to his advantage . ”
105224	105232	105018	105018	I	83	“ Why are you telling me this ? ”
105233	105310	105048	105048	Giovanna	135	“ Because you gave me back my little boy . You made him believe in love again . I have never — ever — seen him laugh with another woman the way I ’ve seen him laugh with you . Or stick up for another woman the way he sticks up for you . And I do n’t want what happened to him to happen to you merely because he ’s terrified to love you back . ”
105311	105314	105048	105048	Giovanna	135	“ Stop . ”
105315	105392	105018	105018	I	83	“ Thomas ’s death shook him . It shook all of us . But then Mathias and Jonas both got married too , leaving Hayes as the world ’s most prominent single man in possession of such a large fortune , if you ’ll forgive the reference — I was worried he ’d do something drastic . I followed him to Maine with Amelia because I did n’t want him to do something he ’d regret . ”
105393	105400	105048	105048	Giovanna	135	“ Or something you ’d regret . ”
105401	105435	105436	105436	She	2257	“ Antonio showed up at his house with an eligible bachelorette in tow two years ago , and Hayes retreated to Maine and started dating the mayor there without a fake relationship contract . ”
105441	105469	105436	105436	She	2257	“ Kristine is a lovely woman , but Hayes would n’t have been happy with her , and he would n’t have been fair to her either . ”
105470	105474	105487	105487	I	83	“ Fair how ? ”
105475	105486	105487	105487	I	83	“ She deserves to be loved . We all do . ”
105562	105573	105555	105555	I	83	“ You ’ve made your point . You can go . ”
105574	105586	105587	105587	She	2257	“ Oh , Begonia , he could so easily love you . ”
105627	105656	105604	105604	she	2257	“ And he wants to . He does . But big feelings — he has n’t let himself feel them in so long , he just needs time . ”
105657	105666	105667	105667	I	83	“ Please do n’t give me false hope , ”
105670	105675	105667	105667	I	83	“ You love him . ”
105676	105725	105604	105604	she	2257	“ What difference does it make ? I deserve love . I do . I deserve to be loved back , to not be the one doing all the loving . I do n’t want to be the woman that a man only appreciates once she ’s gone . ”
105726	105734	105604	105604	she	2257	“ Why do you love my son ? ”
105735	105746	105610	105610	she	2257	“ Because he pays attention and he believes in me . ”
105754	105991	105992	105992	I	83	“ We were fake . He did n’t have to join me for breakfast when we were the only two people in the house . He did n’t have to skip that dinner cruise with you to join me for an awkward picnic on the beach . He did n’t have to make me tea . He did n’t have to tolerate my dog . With his allergies . He did n’t have to set my phone up on wifi so that I could talk to my sister . He did n’t have to fly her in to see me . He did n’t have to set up an art studio in his house so that I could make terrible pottery . But he listened . He paid attention . He did n’t mock me . He looked at me like I was beautiful , flaws and all . And it was n’t about the money . It was about the thought . He ’s the first man I ’ve known in my adult life who thought . And who cared enough to act on the thought . And I want — I want him to feel as much love as he made me feel with the simplest little things that no one else has ever done for me before . I want him to know how very much he deserves to be loved and adored . ”
106053	106095	106045	106045	Giovanna	135	“ No matter what happens between you and Hayes , I hope you know you can call me for anything , anytime . And that ’s not an offer I ’ve made to any of his other former girlfriends . Ever . ”
106096	106101	106157	106157	she	453	“ We were pretend . ”
106102	106118	106120	106120	Hayes	2931	“ No , Begonia . My sweet child . You most definitely were not pretend . ”
106143	106151	106152	106152	Keisha	453	“ You have two choices , Romeo , ”
106166	106215	106157	106157	she	453	“ You can remove your foot from your mouth , go apologize , and beg her to take you back , or you can finish the job and retire with all of your investments and go live as a hermit on top of a mountain in the Andes . ”
106216	106225	106226	106226	Jonas	404	“ Satellite phones still work in the Andes , ”
106272	106312	106257	106257	I	83	“ But here ’s some good news — some dude named Andreas who ’s been trading artwork with non - fungible tokens just became the world ’s newest billionaire . Congrats , Hayes . You ’re off the hook . ”
106313	106318	106319	106319	Keisha	453	“ He ’s engaged , ”
106322	106327	106319	106319	Keisha	453	“ To a dude . ”
106328	106357	106257	106257	I	83	“ Oh . Ah . Yeah , I see that now . Correction . Sorry , Hayes , you ’re still the world ’s most eligible male billionaire . ”
106358	106399	106319	106319	Keisha	453	“ But Hayes ca n’t date anyone for like another six days without getting called a playboy , and god knows your family wo n’t tolerate that . So he has almost another week before he ’s truly in danger . ”
106400	106407	106319	106319	Keisha	453	“ They ’re your family too . ”
106408	106434	106435	106435	She	2260	“ Only on good days . Hey , what do you think of this statue ? I ’m thinking Millie needs it for her birthday . ”
106444	106449	106450	106450	Jonas	404	“ Are those breasts ? ”
106453	106471	106450	106450	Jonas	404	“ It ’s like what would happen if you mashed breasts with ass and added three vaginas . ”
106472	106479	106319	106319	Keisha	453	“ Why ’s it mint green ? ”
106480	106490	106491	106491	I	83	“ Would you two shut up and go away ? ”
106494	106504	106491	106491	I	83	“ Some of us have actual work to do . ”
106505	106512	106513	106513	Jonas	404	“ I ’m on the clock , ”
106516	106547	106513	106513	Jonas	404	“ Next role is a broken - hearted miser hiding from the world in a cabin in the woods . This is character study . I ’m absorbing your aura . ”
106548	106556	106557	106557	Keisha	453	“ I ’m on the clock too , ”
106560	106604	106605	106605	I	83	“ Your dad ’s afraid you ’ll bury your grief in one of your executive assistants , and yes , that ’s a euphemism , and apparently everyone likes them too much for us to have another situation like the one with Thomas . ”
106613	106619	106620	106620	her	453	“ Yes , Mr. Rutherford ? ”
106625	106638	106620	106620	her	453	“ Throw these yahoos out of my office and change the locks . ”
106639	106676	106620	106620	her	453	“ They ’re worried about you , Mr. Rutherford . Although their concerns that either of us would cross professional lines with you are unfounded . Also , tell Keisha that Millie would hate that statue . ”
106677	106687	106620	106620	her	453	“ Are you trying to convince me to quit ? ”
106688	106716	106620	106620	her	453	“ My brother is a professor of computational physics at this little college in Vermont , and he says he could use a mathematician on his team . ”
106717	106730	106620	106620	her	453	“ Once again , are you trying to convince me to quit ? ”
106731	106781	106782	106782	Jonas	404	“ No , merely making random conversation since there ’s not much that makes you happy these days . Excuse me , Mr. Rutherford , but if there ’s nothing else I can do for you immediately , I have another stack of work from you that needs attention . ”
106809	106821	106822	106822	I	83	“ I could be a CFO . This seems so easy . ”
106829	106837	106838	106838	Jonas	404	“ I ’m going for a walk . ”
106845	106874	106838	106838	Jonas	404	“ Need a bodyguard ? I need to prep for one of those roles too . But hold two seconds . Head rush . Got up too fast . ”
106875	106885	106886	106886	I	83	“ Do n’t you have something else to do ? ”
106894	106899	106889	106889	Keisha	453	“ Like your wife ? ”
106900	106911	106838	106838	Jonas	404	“ Not until her plane touches down from LA tonight . ”
106912	106925	106889	106889	Keisha	453	“ I do not need you to play bodyguard . I need — ”
106926	106929	106930	106933	the two of them	2262	“ Begonia , ”
107150	107160	107141	107141	I	83	“ She told the tabloids that we were fake . ”
107175	107194	107141	107141	I	83	“ I bet Millie six million dollars that Marshmallow had more to do with that than Begonia did . ”
107195	107203	107204	107204	Jonas	404	“ Did she seriously take that bet ? ”
107207	107286	107204	107204	Jonas	404	“ No , because she ’s not a sucker . Also , she called up someone she used to know — don’t ask — and they went out riding last night — again , do n’t ask — and apparently found the ‘ reporter ’ who broke the story , and he swore up and down that he was lurking at the edges of Sagewood House ’s property when a miracle dog appeared and handed him the contract . ”
107287	107293	107204	107204	Jonas	404	“ Stop making shit up . ”
107294	107309	107310	107310	Jonas	404	“ I ’m not making it up . That ’s what Millie told me . ”
107318	107347	107310	107310	Jonas	404	“ Do you think Begonia would let us borrow Marshmallow on - set ? That would be horrific for filming , but can you imagine the end result ? ”
107558	107565	107550	107550	Merriweather	211	“ I do n’t need coffee , ”
107570	107576	107566	107566	I	83	“ This is for me . ”
107577	107584	107585	107585	I	83	“ What on earth do you — ”
107594	107646	107588	107588	Winnie	89	“ Mr. Rutherford , you ’re walking around like a kicked puppy , and it does n’t take geniuses to figure out why . We ’re having an intervention , or we ’re both quitting . I probably need a coffee for this too . And I do n’t drink coffee . ”
107647	107651	107652	107652	I	83	“ An intervention ? ”
107658	107681	107655	107655	Merriweather	211	“ An intervention . You need your head removed from your nether regions , and we have nothing else left to lose . ”
107682	107686	107687	107687	I	83	“ Excuse you — ”
107698	107737	107738	107738	I	83	“ You miss Begonia , because she ’s Begonia , but you wo n’t do anything about it , because you ’re you , which is literally the only thing standing between you and Begonia being happy together . ”
107741	107752	107738	107738	I	83	“ You have not known me nearly long enough to — ”
107753	107763	107764	107764	Merriweather	211	“ Do you honestly think Begonia would reject you ? ”
107815	107825	107826	107826	Winnie	89	“ No , but she would n’t reject anyone . ”
107829	107847	107826	107826	Winnie	89	“ She divorced her husband . I ’d say the woman knows what she does n’t want . ”
107848	107854	107855	107855	Merriweather	211	“ And what she does , ”
107865	107876	107877	107877	Keisha	453	“ Hey ! Are you having an intervention without us ? ”
107917	107976	107909	107909	I	83	“ Did it ever occur to you , Mr. Rutherford , that Begonia is just as afraid of not being loved as you are of not being loved enough by her ? Do you realize , to even the smallest degree , how unfair that is to her ? And how much she ’s probably hurting right now ? ”
107977	107983	107984	107984	Merriweather	211	“ Love ’s a leap . ”
108014	108035	108036	108036	I	83	“ Begonia is Begonia , and she probably has more men vying for her attention now than I have women , ”
108039	108048	108049	108049	Merriweather	211	“ Probably not , because men are dumb , ”
108066	108069	108063	108063	I	83	“ Also , ”
108080	108114	108070	108070	Merriweather	211	“ any man who wants her because of the tabloid coverage will be the kind of man she can see through , and if he ’s smoother than that , she needs you . ”
108115	108122	108123	108123	Winnie	89	“ Which would you rather have , ”
108132	108146	108123	108123	Winnie	89	“ a safe life without love , or a risky life with it ? ”
108147	108162	108163	108163	Merriweather	211	“ We ’re basically pulling our hair out over how dense you ’re being , ”
108167	108213	108163	108163	Merriweather	211	“ It ’s Begonia . One , she clearly adores you . Two , all she really asks in return is that you adore her back . Three , she did n’t want to fall in love at all , yet here you both are . ”
108214	108244	108250	108250	I	83	“ She flew across the country to rescue the world ’s worst dog . If she can love Marshmallow , surely , she can stay loyal to you too . ”
108245	108249	108250	108250	I	83	“ Excuse you — ”
108263	108288	108254	108254	Winnie	89	“ No , no , you do n’t get to talk yet . Do you know anyone in this world more loyal than Begonia ? ”
108289	108292	108163	108163	Merriweather	211	“ No . ”
108293	108312	108163	108163	Merriweather	211	“ Do you know anyone in this world who ’s a bigger dick than her ex - husband ? ”
108313	108316	108254	108254	Winnie	89	“ Yes . ”
108317	108329	108163	108163	Merriweather	211	“ Are you a bigger dick than her ex - husband ? ”
108330	108390	108391	108393	Neither of them	3239	“ Only to people who are not Begonia . Probably to people sitting here in my office who should be biting their tongues right now , and who are only still employed because you ’ve clearly been talking to her behind my back , and I want to know what you know , and I want to know now . ”
108400	108408	108409	108409	Winnie	89	“ We have n’t talked to her , ”
108412	108424	108409	108409	Winnie	89	“ We ’ve talked to other people who know her better . ”
108425	108431	108163	108163	Merriweather	211	“ They ’re making suppositions . ”
108432	108442	108409	108409	Winnie	89	“ But based on what we know about her — ”
108443	108452	108409	108409	Winnie	89	“ And the way she looked at you — ”
108453	108461	108163	108163	Merriweather	211	“ We ’re assuming we ’re right . ”
108462	108489	108409	108409	Winnie	89	“ So what the h - e - double - hockey - sticks are you doing here instead of chasing her down and getting her back ? ”
108490	108493	108409	108409	Winnie	89	“ I — ”
108494	108503	108504	108504	Keisha	453	“ She got fired from her teaching job , ”
108510	108521	108504	108504	Keisha	453	“ That blow job was a bad look for her . ”
108522	108540	108541	108541	Jonas	404	“ Mom said she looked like crap when she tracked her down somewhere in North Carolina too , ”
108566	108574	108544	108544	I	83	“ Our mother went to see Begonia . ”
108597	108602	108593	108594	My brother	388	“ She was worried . ”
108612	108617	108603	108603	I	83	“ She hated Begonia . ”
108618	108625	108626	108626	Keisha	453	“ She knew it was fake , ”
108629	108643	108644	108644	Jonas	404	“ Marshmallow traded her vibrator for Begonia ’s copy of your signed contract . ”
108664	108672	108603	108603	I	83	“ Do n’t ever say that again . ”
108673	108686	108603	108603	I	83	“ What ? The part where your mother has a — mmph ! ”
108687	108690	108691	108691	I	83	“ When ? ”
108694	108753	108691	108691	I	83	“ You want details , talk to her . Pretty sure she was trying to clean up the mess and do what we do best , but it was n’t enough to keep Begonia from getting fired from her job . Sucks too . I heard she ’s a great art teacher . World needs more of those . ”
108946	108949	108952	108952	her	83	“ Baby ? ”
108967	108970	108971	108971	she	83	“ Begonia , ”
108986	108991	108983	108983	her	83	“ What ? What ? ”
108998	109004	108992	108992	I	83	“ Camp Funshine sold again . ”
109005	109059	108971	108971	she	83	“ What ? No . No . Why did n’t we know it was for sale ? What are they going to ruin now ? We ’ve done this , Hy . I ’m not doing it again . I ’m not watching this again . Not right now . Not right now . ”
109060	109081	108992	108992	I	83	“ B. Stop . Slow down . Listen . The new owner wants to make it into a camp again . ”
109082	109085	108971	108971	she	83	“ What ? ”
109086	109112	109113	109113	My	83	“ Stop saying what ? ! Just — just stay there . I ’m coming to get you . Get Marshmallow ready for the car . ”
109281	109287	109288	109288	I	83	“ Why are we going ? ”
109291	109298	109288	109288	I	83	“ What can we do now ? ”
109299	109305	109288	109288	I	83	“ They want our advice . ”
109306	109315	109288	109288	I	83	“ Now ? Now ? Hello , warning . ”
109316	109396	109397	109397	I	83	“ Begonia . If this is the only time my kids ever get to see Camp Funshine , we ’re fucking going , okay ? If I ’d been on the vacation of a lifetime in Australia and my kids were at camp in Europe and I got the call that I had one chance to influence what happens to Camp Funshine coming back , I would ’ve fucking flown around the world six times over to get here . ”
109474	109481	109482	109482	I	83	“ We had the best childhood , ”
109504	109508	109509	109509	she	197	“ The best , ”
109624	109628	109629	109629	Hy	197	“ Fucking cow , ”
109632	109636	109637	109637	Dani	272	“ Fucking cow ! ”
109747	109751	109752	109752	Hy	197	“ Fucking bankruptcy , ”
109760	109766	109755	109755	I	83	“ I miss this place . ”
109767	109825	109752	109752	Hy	197	“ I brought handcuffs . We can strap ourselves to the fence post and refuse to leave . And my purse has enough food to feed all five of us plus the baby for at least four days . Jerry will bring refills . I apologize for not having good potty facilities in my bag too though . ”
109826	109833	109755	109755	I	83	“ I love you , Hy . ”
109834	109841	109755	109755	I	83	“ I love you too , B. ”
109888	109892	109893	109893	Dani	272	“ Bad house ! ”
109912	109916	109899	109900	Little Leo	315	“ Baa how ! ”
109917	109927	109994	109994	She	272	“ Show it your fingers , Wee - o ! ”
109928	109933	109899	109900	Little Leo	315	“ Feeg - aahs ! ”
109934	109940	109941	109941	Hy	197	“ I love those kids , ”
109953	109959	109960	109960	I	83	“ Where are we going ? ”
110005	110014	109994	109994	She	272	“ There . That ’s all I got . ”
110111	110116	110117	110117	I	83	“ Fucking art hut , ”
110120	110129	110130	110130	Dani	272	“ Aunt B , do n’t say fuck , ”
110133	110138	110130	110130	Dani	272	“ It not nice . ”
110139	110153	110154	110154	Hyacinth	83	“ It really does n’t sound right on Aunt Begonia , does it ? ”
110165	110170	110160	110160	Dani	272	“ Let me out , ”
110175	110183	110184	110184	She	3134	“ I do n’t want to go . ”
110188	110193	110194	110194	I	83	“ Marshmallow , jailbreak ! ”
110229	110234	110235	110235	Hy	197	“ Stop being dramatic , ”
110238	110244	110235	110235	Hy	197	“ That ’s my job . ”
110245	110253	110235	110235	Hy	197	“ I do n’t want to go . ”
110261	110272	110273	110273	She	3134	“ Hy , it ’s too much . It ’s — ”
110371	110377	110378	110378	Hyacinth	83	“ B , go on , ”
110381	110400	110378	110378	Hyacinth	83	“ I have to spray these rugrats down with bug and tick spray before I let them out . ”
110401	110407	110408	110408	I	83	“ I ’ll get them , ”
110411	110467	110378	110378	Hyacinth	83	“ Begonia . Get your ass into that art hut and make sure the toilets still work , because that ’s the next thing I ’m gon na need , and if I ’m gon na be peeing in the woods instead , I have to spray my cooch with bug and tick spray too . ”
110468	110480	110378	110378	Hyacinth	83	“ Do not spray your cooch with bug and tick spray . ”
110481	110488	110378	110378	Hyacinth	83	“ Go find me a bathroom . ”
110489	110498	110378	110378	Hyacinth	83	“ I ’m sure the new owners will — ”
110499	110502	110503	110503	She	2332	“ Go ! ”
110812	110817	110818	110818	I	83	“ H - hello ? ”
110865	110885	110886	110886	I	83	“ Begonia ? What ’s wrong ? Who hurt you ? I ’ll kill them . I ’ll fucking — ”
110961	110966	110967	110967	He	2931	“ Do n’t cry . ”
110990	110999	110967	110967	He	2931	“ Begonia . My sweet angel . Please — ”
111000	111007	111008	111008	I	83	“ Do n’t call me that . ”
111052	111059	111060	111060	His	2931	“ Do n’t call me that . ”
111075	111087	111067	111067	he	2931	“ I ’ve fucked this up again , have n’t I ? ”
111088	111097	111067	111067	he	2931	“ W - what — you — here ? ”
111098	111103	111104	111104	My	83	“ I missed you . ”
111196	111202	111192	111194	my Georgia O’Keefe	2349	“ You bought my camp . ”
111203	111241	111192	111194	my Georgia O’Keefe	2349	“ It ’s too much . I know . But I ca n’t go small , Begonia . Not for you . Not when I — when you — it ’s yours . It ’s all yours . ”
111242	111250	111192	111194	my Georgia O’Keefe	2349	“ You ca n’t buy my love ! ”
111251	111265	111266	111266	He	2349	“ I know . I know ! But I — Begonia . I — ”
111367	111375	111376	111376	His	2349	“ I ’m so sorry , Begonia . ”
111388	111491	111494	111494	my	83	“ I should ’ve told you . I — god , I have n’t said this to anyone in fifteen years . I ca n’t do words . Words do n’t matter . Not when they ’re tossed about so carelessly , when they ’re twisted and manipulated and used for anything but what the word is supposed to mean — but I can show you . Begonia , let me show you . Please . Please let me show you . Do n’t leave me before I can learn to believe in the goodness of the words you need to hear . ”
111505	111512	111494	111494	my	83	“ You turned the plane around . ”
111513	111747	111494	111494	my	83	“ I ’m sorry . I didn’t — I should n’t have — god , Begonia , I ’m so fucking tired of being afraid to live , and you just breathe and you live . Even when you ’re terrified of something , you ’re alive in it . I ’m a toad basking in the glory of your rainbow , knowing you do n’t need me , that you could have your pick of princes and gods and unicorns , but hoping you want me anyway , because you light up my life . You make me smile . You make me hope . You make me want to dance under the stars . And I — I do n’t know what I have to offer you in return , but whatever it is you want , it ’s yours . You want my time , it ’s yours . You want my ears , they ’re yours . My heart — Begonia . I swear , you stole it the minute you confused me with a dead president , and I do n’t know how that ’s even possible , but it ’s the simple truth . I want to be where you are . I want to bask in your sunshine . And I want to show you every single day how perfect and precious and adored you are . ”
111748	111751	111752	111752	I	83	“ Hayes . ”
111759	111785	111786	111786	I	83	“ Please tell me I ’m not too late . Tell me some lucky fool has n’t swooped in while I was being an idiot . ”
111815	111867	111868	111868	Hayes	2931	“ I want to tell you what you want to hear , but the words feel so hollow and insignificant compared to how I feel about you . I can’t — I ca n’t minimize what you mean to me by using a phrase that ’s been ruined in my head . ”
111889	111897	111898	111898	I	83	“ Can I say it to you ? ”
111901	111916	111898	111898	I	83	“ You can say anything to me . You turn every word into magic . ”
111917	111928	111886	111887	This man	404	“ We ’re a complicated mess , are n’t we ? ”
111929	111949	111898	111898	I	83	“ I ’m a complicated mess , while you are utterly perfect . I ’m fucking this up again . ”
111950	111958	111959	111959	I	83	“ I did n’t want this now , ”
111965	111984	111959	111959	I	83	“ I ’ll wait . I ’ll wait as long as you need . I ’ll be here . ”
112064	112067	112068	112068	I	83	“ Promise ? ”
112071	112078	112068	112068	I	83	“ I would promise you anything . ”
112079	112096	112097	112097	His	2931	“ Just promise you wo n’t leave . Please promise me you wo n’t leave again . ”
112126	112138	112141	112141	him	2931	“ You are my universe , Begonia . My entire world . ”
112172	112177	112178	112178	I	83	“ I missed you , ”
112181	112196	112178	112178	I	83	“ You ’ll never have to again . Never . You have my word . ”
112213	112221	112207	112207	I	83	“ I know you ’ll work late — ”
112222	112243	112244	112244	I	83	“ I requested a transfer to a new division . No more long hours , unless they ’re with you . ”
112312	112356	112304	112304	he	325	“ Family first , and you , Begonia , are my favorite family . And I ’m not merely saying that because I ’m hoping to entice you to join me as the fourth employee of Razzle Dazzle ’s new summer camp division . ”
112357	112362	112378	112378	He	325	“ Shut . Up . ”
112389	112482	112378	112378	He	325	“ You ’re welcome to decline , though I ’m fairly certain Winnie and Merriweather would be devastated . I ’d become unemployed as well , if you do , and would have to spend my days as a mostly useless freeloader happily fetching all the chewed - up wooden works of art your dog can get his jaws on . And that idea does have its own merit . I would be quite content fetching your coffee and tea and art supplies and keeping you from defiling kitchens all day long . ”
112535	112540	112541	112541	I	83	“ Kids or adults ? ”
112544	112570	112541	112541	I	83	“ I was thinking beef , or chicken , or even tofu . Eating kids is frowned upon , and adults can get rather chewy . ”
112571	112588	112589	112589	He	325	“ No , you goofball , the summer camp . Is it for kids or adults ? ”
112608	112620	112603	112603	I	83	“ Ah . Of course . The summer camp . Yes . ”
112621	112624	112541	112541	I	83	“ Yes ? ”
112625	112632	112541	112541	I	83	“ Kids or adults . Yes . ”
112633	112642	112603	112603	I	83	“ Do you have a plan at all ? ”
112643	112683	112684	112684	His	325	“ Yes . Buy a camp , fly to ask Begonia to be my life partner in bringing all of her long - buried dreams to life , and then do whatever she tells me to make that happen . ”
112722	112727	112728	112728	I	83	“ This is you , ”
112741	112748	112749	112749	he	325	“ This is me with you , ”
112753	112758	112749	112749	he	325	“ Only with you . ”
112759	112764	112765	112765	Hyacinth	83	“ It ’s you ? ”
112777	112804	112805	112805	Hayes	2931	“ Oh , for fuck ’s sake . Watch my kids . I ’m gon na go find a tick - infested bush to piss in . ”
112865	112876	112877	112877	I	83	“ There ’s no crying in art , little Leo , ”
112882	112899	112877	112877	I	83	“ Wanna see where your mama got in trouble for painting an elephant with two trunks ? ”
112900	112907	112908	112908	Hayes	2931	“ Sit , you furry beast , ”
112947	112960	112961	112961	Hayes	2931	“ What kind of trouble will he get into at summer camp ? ”
112987	112997	112998	112998	He	315	“ There ’s only one way to find out . ”
113029	113040	113041	113041	he	315	“ Thank you for showing me how to live again , ”
113044	113053	113054	113054	I	83	“ Thank you for knowing what ’s important , ”
113058	113073	113054	113054	I	83	“ I will cherish you until the end of time , my perfect Begonia . ”
113148	113155	113156	113156	I	83	“ Just a few more feet , ”
113184	113198	113170	113170	her	83	“ Why does it smell like the ocean is right under my feet ? ”
113219	113224	113225	113225	She	83	“ Because it is . ”
113242	113248	113249	113249	I	83	“ I ’ve got you , ”
113258	113283	113249	113249	I	83	“ And we ’re not going anywhere . We ’re docked . Wo n’t leave the pier unless you beg . Cross my heart . ”
113302	113308	113309	113309	she	83	“ Whose boat is this ? ”
113312	113327	113309	113309	she	83	“ Mine . And it ’s a yacht , if you do n’t mind . ”
113328	113338	113339	113339	She	83	“ Oh , is that so , Mr. Fancy ? ”
113361	113366	113367	113367	I	83	“ So very so , ”
113384	113389	113390	113390	She	83	“ You feel okay ? ”
113411	113460	113402	113402	I	83	“ Fresh sea air , gorgeous fall trees , sunny skies , and the sweetest , most thoughtful boyfriend in existence holding me and ready to pull me off this boat if I start to feel woozy ? I feel so amazing , I might have to dance . ”
113464	113470	113471	113471	she	83	“ I can too dance , ”
113475	113493	113471	113471	she	83	“ And even if I could n’t , I should . Anyone can do anything they enjoy . ”
113494	113500	113501	113501	I	83	“ I enjoy doing you , ”
113512	113529	113471	113471	she	83	“ You knew I ’d chicken out if you let me see where we were going . ”
113530	113536	113471	113471	she	83	“ I suspected as much . ”
113537	113552	113471	113471	she	83	“ You took the leap for me and pulled me along for the ride . ”
113553	113583	113584	113584	She	83	“ Bluebell , you ’ve led me to the cliff of so many leaps I never thought I ’d take . It ’s only fair to return the favor . ”
113587	113593	113584	113584	She	83	“ We are so weird . ”
113594	113606	113608	113608	she	83	“ We are so us . Would you like a tour ? ”
113629	113637	113619	113619	I	83	“ We are standing on this boat . ”
113638	113641	113642	113642	she	83	“ Yacht , ”
113654	113660	113645	113645	I	83	“ That is the ocean . ”
113677	113682	113668	113668	She	83	“ What ’s that ? ”
113683	113724	113725	113725	Violins	320	“ That is the most beautiful fall display you ’ll see anywhere in the world . And it ’s even more gorgeous when you sail up and down the shoreline , which we ’ll only do when you ’re ready . ”
113743	113752	113732	113732	she	83	“ You hired the Oysterberry Bay Island Orchestra . ”
113753	113780	113815	113816	this woman	83	“ And if you do n’t feel too ill after your adventure on a boat , I do believe there ’s a feast waiting for us . ”
113781	113784	113732	113732	she	83	“ Hayes . ”
113785	113791	113792	113792	She	83	“ Yes , my bluebell ? ”
113804	113809	113810	113810	she	83	“ This is love , ”
113826	113836	113818	113818	She	83	“ And it ’s my favorite kind of love , ”
113853	113862	113841	113841	She	83	“ You are my favorite kind of everything . ”
114309	114316	114282	114282	She	83	“ Show me the dance floor . ”
114389	114394	114397	114397	him	84	“ Put it down , ”
114399	114407	114395	114395	I	83	“ And then go dry yourself off . ”
114499	114506	114507	114507	I	83	“ Let it out , bluebell , ”
114536	114565	114566	114566	she	83	“ When we get back to Driftwood Manor , we ’re locking him in his room , and then I ’m going to recreate the day we met , ”
114574	114578	114566	114566	she	83	“ Are you ? ”
114579	114583	114584	114584	She	83	“ I am . ”
114596	114606	114584	114584	She	83	“ Except without the hot wax and hair dye . ”
114607	114612	114613	114613	She	83	“ And the singing ? ”
114647	114652	114653	114653	I	83	“ I love you , ”
114675	114696	114697	114697	She	83	“ I love you and adore you and want to spend the rest of my days cherishing and worshipping you . ”
114730	114744	114721	114721	her	83	“ I love you is n’t enough for how I feel about you . ”
115535	115549	115550	115550	she	83	“ That was way better than any acting Jonas Rutherford has ever done ! ”
115553	115561	115562	115562	Jonas	404	“ I can hear you , Hy , ”
115569	115574	115562	115562	Jonas	404	“ She ’s aware , ”
115620	115627	115628	115628	she	83	“ Would you look at that ? ”
115634	115663	115628	115628	she	83	“ I think my twin sister ’s here . I ca n’t see her , but that sounded like her . Who wants to see me get doubled ? ”
115701	115706	115693	115693	she	83	“ This suits Begonia , ”
115777	115788	115789	115789	I	83	“ She ’d try anything , but you ’re right , ”
115795	115801	115789	115789	I	83	“ This definitely suits her . ”
115802	115808	115809	115809	Dani	272	“ It ’s fucking late , ”
115837	115849	115850	115850	He	315	“ Did I miss it ? We had a potty problem . ”
115895	115901	115902	115902	Jerry	194	“ She loves this camp , ”
115905	115933	115902	115902	Jerry	194	“ It ’s a really good thing you make it pretty clear you can only handle one woman , because Hy would dump me for this camp . ”
115934	115942	115943	115944	my mother	348	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , Jerry , ”
115947	115989	115943	115944	my mother	348	“ Hyacinth would never leave you for this camp or for Hayes . He gives terrible foot rubs . And she ’s too busy to fully appreciate camp . Now , once your little ones are old enough to be campers … ”
115990	116001	116002	116002	Begonia	83	“ Crap . I ’ve got ta up my game . ”
116079	116086	116087	116087	Begonia	83	“ Do n’t get in trouble , ”
116111	116130	116105	116106	The crowd	1919	“ This calls for an interruption if you want this place still standing before the corporate retreats start , ”
116149	116157	116137	116137	I	83	“ It does , does n’t it ? ”
116158	116167	116168	116168	Jonas	404	“ You sure you want to do this ? ”
116223	116236	116237	116237	I	83	“ I ’ve never been more sure about anything in my life , ”
116241	116249	116250	116250	He	404	“ Here . Hold the little guy . ”
116258	116262	116250	116250	He	404	“ Good sign . ”
116284	116291	116292	116292	she	83	“ Well , this is unusual , ”
116310	116344	116345	116345	She	83	“ Look at this . We get the man responsible for Camp Funshine ’s reincarnation himself . Now , go easy on Mr. Rutherford , okay ? He does n’t like big crowds . ”
116385	116393	116394	116394	I	83	“ Always wondered if that would happen , ”
116399	116407	116408	116408	she	83	“ What brings you to the stage ? ”
116412	116417	116408	116408	she	83	“ I missed you . ”
116425	116435	116408	116408	she	83	“ Begonia did n’t introduce Mr. Rutherford here properly , ”
116439	116461	116462	116463	The kids	961	“ He ’s actually her b - o - y - f - r - i - e - n - d. ”
116468	116489	116490	116493	one of the teenagers	2445	“ We know ! We saw them k - i - s - s - i - n - g , ”
116501	116504	116496	116496	Hyacinth	83	“ Scandalous ! ”
116505	116508	116509	116509	I	83	“ Truly , ”
116573	116592	116561	116561	she	83	“ Okay , okay , calm down . Grown - ups are allowed to date . And kiss . ”
116593	116600	116601	116601	someone	334	“ And grown - ups also — ”
116613	116635	116601	116601	someone	334	“ Ernie Brown , if you finish that sentence , you do n’t get to meet any other special guests tonight . ”
116641	116644	116645	116645	she	83	“ Now , ”
116648	116684	116685	116685	She	83	“ since our dear Mr. Rutherford has come all the way up to the stage — for the first time all summer , I might add — let ’s see what he has to say . ”
116690	116697	116685	116685	She	83	“ And the floor is yours . ”
116733	116745	116727	116727	I	83	“ Actually , I ’d prefer to just talk to you . ”
116769	116773	116766	116766	her	83	“ Right here ? ”
116774	116786	116757	116757	Begonia	83	“ It does seem to be one of your favorite places . ”
116794	116801	116757	116757	Begonia	83	“ I have many favorite places . ”
116802	116807	116808	116808	Hyacinth	83	“ That ’s true , ”
116812	116817	116818	116818	Jerry	194	“ She ’s notorious , ”
116827	116836	116818	116818	Jerry	194	“ Would you two please let him talk ? ”
116841	116854	116855	116855	I	83	“ Do you realize you ’re surrounded by people who adore you ? ”
116871	116900	116861	116861	She	348	“ And surrounded by people that I adore in return . This is n’t where either of us thought we ’d be when we met , is it ? ”
116901	116906	116907	116907	I	83	“ Not at all . ”
116934	116943	116944	116944	someone	334	“ Is he gon na kiss her again ? ”
116948	116953	116944	116944	someone	334	“ I hope not , ”
116962	116965	116944	116944	someone	334	“ Ew . ”
116966	116971	116972	116972	I	83	“ What I hope , ”
116981	117023	116972	116972	I	83	“ is that each of you has learned a fraction of what I learn every day about the world and how to live life to the fullest , for having had the privilege of spending it with this lovely woman here . ”
117037	117040	117041	117041	she	83	“ Hayes , ”
117050	117109	117110	117110	She	83	“ You , my dear bluebell , have done the impossible . You ’ve taken a cold , battered , hidden heart and taught it the true meaning of love . You ’ve restored my faith in humanity , pulled me back into the world , and brought as much peace to my life as you have joy . ”
117119	117125	117110	117110	She	83	“ You make it easy . ”
117126	117183	117241	117241	she	83	“ The day we met , the only thing I wanted was peace , quiet , and solitude . And I know I was the last thing you wanted that day too . The universe had other plans for both of us , and I find I want something I never thought could exist for me . ”
117184	117189	117190	117190	I	83	“ What ’s that ? ”
117237	117240	117241	117241	she	83	“ Hayes , ”
117245	117316	117241	117241	she	83	“ What I want , Begonia , is to marry my best friend , the woman I adore and cherish beyond reason , the only person on this earth who could make me believe in the honesty of love again . I want to marry you and spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you make me every single day . If you ’ll have me . ”
117345	117362	117339	117339	she	83	“ Hayes Rutherford , you know you do n’t have to marry me to keep me . ”
117363	117419	117339	117339	she	83	“ And yet I have an inexplicable urge to stand on a mountaintop and vow to love you for all eternity anyway . I want it all , bluebell . Babies and awkward holiday parties with our families and gray hair and adventure and life . I want to tie my life with yours forever . ”
117420	117427	117428	117428	someone	334	“ Say yes , Ms. Begonia ! ”
117431	117439	117428	117428	someone	334	“ Men are gross ! Say no ! ”
117479	117488	117489	117489	I	83	“ I do n’t mind earning that yes , ”
117494	117513	117489	117489	I	83	“ And I do n’t mind being told no , so long as you ’ll still keep me . ”
117514	117522	117523	117523	She	186	“ I could never tell you no . ”
117546	117588	117589	117589	she	186	“ I love you , Hayes . I love you and adore you and cherish you and want to spend the rest of my life doing all the things I know to do to make you smile and laugh and also — ”
117593	117612	117589	117589	she	186	“ — all those things we should n’t talk about in front of an audience of horny teenagers . ”
117613	117619	117620	117620	I	83	“ Is that a yes ? ”
117642	117661	117662	117662	she	186	“ It ’s a double - triple - quadruple with whipped cream and a cherry on top yes , ”
117739	117748	117749	117749	she	186	“ It ’s the color of my hair , ”
117752	117759	117749	117749	she	186	“ Exactly right , my love . ”
117796	117799	117800	117800	Begonia	186	“ Marshmallow ! ”
117852	117862	117863	117863	I	83	“ Is that from Great Grandma Eileen ’s collection ? ”
117894	117900	117901	117901	she	186	“ Hayes . The children , ”
117904	117913	117914	117914	I	83	“ Tell the dog to take it home . ”
117940	117946	117930	117930	I	83	“ Marshmallow , go home , ”
117956	117964	117950	117950	He	2466	“ Go give it to Grandma Giovanna , ”
117971	117974	117965	117965	I	83	“ Hayes . ”
118024	118037	118038	118038	I	83	“ Thank you for spending part of your summer at Camp Funshine , ”
118043	118065	118038	118038	I	83	“ Excuse us . I believe this lady is now mine . Jonas , come apologize for us properly , please . ”
118097	118122	118123	118123	she	186	“ Hayes . We have to make sure that ’s the only piece of Great Grandma Eileen ’s collection that he brought out here , ”
118126	118140	118141	118141	She	186	“ I ’m sure Hyacinth would be delighted to do it for us . ”
118156	118176	118179	118179	her	186	“ Do you know how much I love you ? Truly love you ? Simply because you ’re you ? ”
118197	118219	118221	118221	I	83	“ I have an inkling . And now I ’d very much like to show you how much I love you . ”
