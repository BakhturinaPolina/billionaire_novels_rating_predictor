2305	2308	2309	2309	I	2959	“ What ? ”
2312	2332	2309	2309	I	2959	“ Perhaps the guy at the desk thought you were gorgeous and upgraded you to try to impress you . ”
2333	2341	2342	2342	I	2959	“ I had n’t thought of that . ”
2362	2370	2371	2371	I	2959	“ Is that what you would do ? ”

2528	2559	2520	2520	I	2959	“ I ’m simply saying that you ’re attractive , nothing more and nothing less . Do n’t read into it . It was a statement , not a question . ”
2560	2563	2564	2564	I	2959	“ Oh . ”
2630	2637	2638	2638	he	55	“ You do n’t like takeoffs ? ”

3152	3156	3157	3157	I	2959	“ Sounds boring , ”
3166	3173	3160	3160	He	266	“ I ’ll let you know . ”
3306	3313	3314	3314	he	266	“ You ’re watching a romance ? ”
3317	3323	3324	3324	I	2959	“ A rom - com , ”
3347	3351	3352	3354	the flight attendant	273	“ More champagne ? ”

3402	3412	3413	3413	he	266	“ What do you like about rom - coms ? ”
3428	3437	3438	3438	I	2959	“ Men who do n’t talk during movies , ”
3451	3460	3445	3445	He	266	“ What do you like about . . . ”
3474	3478	3479	3479	I	2959	“ Political films ? ”
3482	3493	3479	3479	I	2959	“ The fact that they ’re boring as all hell ? ”
3494	3507	3479	3479	I	2959	“ I just like true stories , regardless of what they are . ”
3508	3513	3514	3514	I	2959	“ So do I , ”
3517	3529	3530	3530	He	266	“ That ’s why I like romance . Love is true . ”
3545	3551	3539	3539	I	2959	“ What does that mean ? ”
3552	3579	3580	3580	I	2959	“ Rom - coms are as far from reality as you can get . I bet you ’re the type who reads trashy romance novels too . ”
3593	3626	3627	3627	I	2959	“ I am , actually . . . and if you must know , I ’m watching Magic Mike XXL after this so I can watch gorgeous men take their clothes off . ”
3634	3651	3652	3652	He	266	“ And I ’ll smile through the whole damn thing , regardless of your snooty judgment . ”
3792	3796	3797	3797	He	266	“ Excuse me . ”
3844	3850	3823	3823	I	2959	“ I ’m so sorry , ”

3868	3873	3862	3862	He	266	“ More than fine . ”
3884	3893	3894	3894	I	2959	“ There ’s a method to my madness . ”
3939	3947	3948	3948	I	2959	“ What did you mean by that ? ”
3958	3961	3948	3948	I	2959	“ Nothing . ”
3962	3979	3980	3980	He	266	“ Did you give me the window seat so I would have to climb over you ? ”
3988	4011	3980	3980	He	266	“ No , I gave you the window seat because you wanted it . Climbing over me was just an added bonus . ”
4044	4053	4054	4054	I	2959	“ Are you flirting with me , Jim ? ”
4066	4075	4057	4057	He	266	“ I do n’t know . Am I ? ”
4076	4092	4093	4093	He	266	“ I asked you first , and do n’t answer my question with a question . ”
4106	4121	4096	4096	he	266	“ This is probably where you should start flirting back . . . Emily . ”
4138	4154	4155	4155	I	2959	“ I do n’t flirt . I either want a man or I do n’t , ”
4158	4163	4164	4164	he	266	“ Is that so ? ”
4170	4185	4164	4164	he	266	“ And how long after you meet a man do you make that decision ? ”
4186	4189	4190	4190	I	2959	“ Instantaneously , ”
4209	4212	4213	4213	he	266	“ Really ? ”
4223	4236	4237	4237	he	266	“ Excuse me , can we have two more champagnes , please ? ”
4241	4247	4248	4248	His	266	“ Of course , sir . ”
4256	4270	4271	4271	I	2959	“ Well , do tell . What was your first impression of me ? ”
4282	4304	4305	4305	He	266	“ You may need something stronger to drink to hear this , Jim . You ’re not going to like it . ”
4321	4326	4327	4327	I	2959	“ What ’s funny ? ”
4330	4334	4327	4327	I	2959	“ You are . ”
4335	4341	4342	4342	I	2959	“ Why am I funny ? ”
4345	4354	4342	4342	I	2959	“ This sense of righteousness that you have . ”
4355	4375	4376	4376	Our	305	“ Oh , like you do n’t have that too . . . Mr. I ’ll Have Two Champagnes . ”
4402	4410	4397	4397	he	266	“ What were you doing in London ? ”
4411	4414	4415	4415	I	2959	“ Ugh . ”
4420	4442	4415	4415	I	2959	“ I flew over for a friend ’s wedding , and to be honest , I wish I had n’t gone . ”
4443	4447	4397	4397	he	266	“ Why not ? ”
4448	4475	4483	4483	he	266	“ My ex was there with his new squeeze , and he was being over - the - top affectionate with her to piss me off . ”
4476	4482	4483	4483	he	266	“ Which worked , obviously , ”
4493	4496	4483	4483	he	266	“ Hmm . ”
4504	4509	4483	4483	he	266	“ Just a little . ”
4510	4517	4483	4483	he	266	“ What did she look like ? ”
4518	4541	4483	4483	he	266	“ Long bleached - blonde hair and huge silicone lips and boobs and eyelashes and fake tan and everything I ’m not . ”
4542	4545	4546	4546	He	266	“ Hmm . ”
4550	4557	4558	4558	He	266	“ Like Backseat Barbie on crack . ”
4561	4568	4569	4569	I	2959	“ Everyone loves a Backseat Barbie . ”
4577	4607	4569	4569	I	2959	“ This is probably where you should tell me that all men hate Backseat Barbies , Jim . Do n’t you know anything about polite plane - conversation etiquette ? ”
4608	4612	4613	4613	He	266	“ Obviously not . ”
4621	4628	4613	4613	He	266	“ Why would I do that ? ”
4638	4643	4629	4629	I	2959	“ To be nice . ”
4644	4649	4650	4650	He	266	“ Oh , right . ”
4659	4672	4650	4650	He	266	“ Emily . . . all men are repulsed by Backseat Barbies . ”
4683	4689	4673	4673	I	2959	“ Thank you , Jim . ”
4690	4695	4696	4696	He	266	“ Although . . . ”
4702	4711	4696	4696	He	266	“ If they give good head . . . ”
4742	4745	4746	4746	I	2959	“ Jim , ”
4775	4789	4790	4790	I	2959	“ Men who look like you are not supposed to talk about head . ”
4793	4797	4798	4798	he	266	“ Why not ? ”
4802	4815	4798	4798	he	266	“ And what do you mean , men who look like me ? ”
4816	4822	4823	4823	He	266	“ All serious and stuff . ”
4829	4833	4823	4823	He	266	“ Define stuff . ”
4834	4845	4846	4846	His	266	“ You know , older , rich , and bossy . ”
4852	4866	4867	4867	I	2959	“ And what gives you the impression that I ’m rich and bossy ? ”
4874	4879	4867	4867	I	2959	“ You look rich . ”
4880	4885	4823	4823	He	266	“ How do I ? ”
4886	4897	4898	4898	I	2959	“ Your fancy watch . The cut of your shirt . ”
4905	4922	4898	4898	I	2959	“ I ’ve never seen shoes like that before . Where did you even get those ? ”
4923	4930	4931	4931	He	266	“ In a shop , Emily . ”
4937	4954	4955	4955	I	2959	“ And I ’ll have you know that this watch was a gift from a girlfriend . ”
4960	4970	4971	4971	He	266	“ I bet she ’s a vegan yoga nut . ”
4974	4982	4971	4971	He	266	“ I know your type of woman . ”
4983	4986	4987	4987	He	266	“ Really . ”
4991	5002	5003	5003	I	2959	“ Please go on — this character analysis is fascinating . ”
5019	5029	5017	5017	fool	306	“ I ’m assuming you live in New York . ”
5030	5033	5017	5017	fool	306	“ Correct . ”
5034	5039	5017	5017	fool	306	“ In an apartment . ”
5040	5043	5017	5017	fool	306	“ Affirmative . ”
5044	5053	5054	5054	He	266	“ You probably work at some ritzy company . ”
5062	5065	5054	5054	He	266	“ Perhaps . ”
5066	5076	5077	5077	I	2959	“ You would have a girlfriend or . . . ”
5081	5105	5106	5106	He	266	“ You do n’t wear a wedding ring . . . so perhaps you cheat on your wife when you travel for work ? ”
5109	5127	5128	5128	I	2959	“ You really should make a profession out of this . I ’m amazed at the accuracy . ”
5138	5146	5147	5147	I	2959	“ What do you think about me ? ”
5150	5163	5147	5147	I	2959	“ What was your first impression when I walked onto the plane ? ”
5164	5167	5168	5168	He	266	“ Well . ”
5176	5185	5168	5168	He	266	“ Do you want the politically correct version ? ”
5186	5194	5147	5147	I	2959	“ No . I want the truth . ”
5195	5250	5251	5251	I	2959	“ Right . . . well , in that case , I noticed your long legs and the curve of your neck . The dimple in your chin . You are the most attractive woman I ’ve seen in a long time , and when you smiled , it brought me to my feet . ”
5261	5273	5251	5251	I	2959	“ And then you spoke . . . and ruined everything . ”
5281	5292	5276	5276	I	2959	“ I ruined everything ? How did I ruin everything ? ”

5335	5360	5365	5365	I	2959	“ And I do n’t want to date myself . I like sweet , demure girls , the ones who do what I say . ”
5361	5364	5365	5365	I	2959	“ Ugh . ”
5370	5383	5365	5365	I	2959	“ The ones who clean the house and have sex on Saturdays . ”
5384	5387	5388	5388	I	2959	“ Precisely . ”
5400	5414	5415	5415	He	2959	“ You ’re not bad for a boring old guy with weird shoes . ”
5418	5433	5415	5415	He	2959	“ And you ’re not bad for a young , hot smart - ass . ”
5434	5446	5447	5447	I	2959	“ Do you want to watch Magic Mike XXL with me ? ”
5450	5479	5447	5447	I	2959	“ I suppose , although I should let you know . . . I am an ex - stripper myself , so this is nothing new for me . ”
5480	5483	5484	5484	I	2959	“ Really ? ”
5491	5499	5500	5500	His	2959	“ You ’re good on a pole ? ”
5505	5516	5503	5503	mine	2959	“ My pole work is the best in the country . ”
5575	5590	5591	5591	he	2959	“ Okay , next question . The weirdest place you ’ve ever had sex ? ”
5597	5605	5594	5594	I	2959	“ You ca n’t ask me that . ”

5623	5627	5628	5628	He	2959	“ Says who ? ”
5632	5644	5645	5645	Jim	266	“ It ’s just a question , and nobody is listening . ”
5661	5664	5665	5665	I	2959	“ Hmm . ”
5670	5677	5665	5665	I	2959	“ That ’s a tough one . ”
5678	5681	5665	5665	I	2959	“ Why ? ”
5682	5702	5665	5665	I	2959	“ I ’m on a bit of a drought at the moment . I can hardly remember any sex . ”
5703	5707	5708	5708	He	2959	“ How long ? ”
5711	5714	5715	5715	I	2959	“ Oh . ”

5745	5748	5739	5739	His	2959	“ What ? ”
5749	5758	5759	5759	I	2959	“ It ’s lame , is n’t it ? ”
5762	5780	5759	5759	I	2959	“ Very . You need to up your game . They ’re very bad statistics , indeed . ”
5781	5785	5786	5786	I	2959	“ I know . ”
5798	5808	5809	5809	I	2959	“ Why am I telling you all this stuff ? ”
5812	5825	5809	5809	I	2959	“ You ’re just some random guy I met on a plane . ”
5826	5837	5844	5844	He	2959	“ Who happens to be very interested in the subject . ”
5838	5843	5844	5844	He	2959	“ Why is that ? ”
5861	5881	5885	5885	him	2959	“ I do n’t understand how someone as hot as you does n’t get fucked three times a day . ”
5930	5939	5940	5940	he	2959	“ How long are you in New York ? ”
5968	5990	5991	5991	I	2959	“ Just the afternoon . I have my interview at six tonight , and then I catch the last flight out , ”
5994	6001	5991	5991	I	2959	“ Can you change your flight ? ”
6004	6007	6008	6008	He	2959	“ No . ”
6024	6027	6028	6028	I	2959	“ What ? ”

6042	6047	6048	6048	His	2959	“ Why is that ? ”
6057	6076	6048	6048	His	2959	“ Because I ’d break that drought of yours and initiate you into the Miles - High Club . ”
6094	6107	6108	6108	I	2959	“ It ’s Mile - High Club . . . not Miles , ”
6111	6120	6121	6121	He	2959	“ No . . . it ’s Miles . ”
6128	6136	6121	6121	He	2959	“ Trust me — it ’s Miles . ”
6165	6177	6178	6178	He	2959	“ You know , I ’ve never fucked a stranger before . ”
6187	6196	6197	6197	he	2959	“ Do you want to fuck a stranger ? ”
6226	6232	6233	6233	he	2959	“ Do n’t be shy , ”
6236	6249	6250	6250	He	2959	“ Tell me , if we were alone right now . . . ”
6258	6267	6250	6250	He	2959	“ What would you give me , Emily ? ”
6308	6311	6312	6312	I	2959	“ Me , ”

6465	6473	6474	6474	Jim	266	“ What happens if we ca n’t ? ”
6477	6519	6474	6474	Jim	266	“ We will fly on to Boston and have an emergency layover for the night . You will be accommodated in a hotel , of course . We ’ll know in the next ten minutes . I ’ll keep you updated . ”
6520	6524	6525	6525	She	54	“ Thank you . ”

11119	11141	11116	11116	I	2959	“ Then if he ’s got nothing going on here , why would n’t he move to New York with you ? ”
11142	11157	11059	11059	I	2959	“ He does n’t like New York . It ’s too busy for him . ”
11158	11197	11198	11198	I	2959	“ Oh , Emily , can you hear the excuses you make for this man ? If he loved you , he would be there supporting your dream , since he does n’t have any of his own . ”
11222	11244	11245	11245	I	2959	“ Are you calling me to stress me out about Robbie , or are you calling me to wish me luck ? ”
11248	11273	11274	11274	I	2959	“ I ’m calling you to wish you luck . Good luck , darling . Go and show them what you ’re made of . ”
11290	11293	11281	11281	I	2959	“ Thanks . ”
11294	11305	11274	11274	I	2959	“ I ’ll call you tonight for a full debrief . ”
11306	11309	11310	11310	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
11313	11321	11310	11310	I	2959	“ I ’m going to go in . ”
11322	11329	11330	11330	She	362	“ Go get ’em , tiger . ”
11362	11370	11355	11355	I	2959	“ Right . You can do this . ”
11864	11867	11868	11868	I	2959	“ Hello . ”
11880	11891	11892	11892	She	381	“ I ’m Emily Foster . I ’m starting today . ”
11896	11915	11916	11916	She	381	“ Hello , Emily , my name is Frances , and I am one of the floor managers . ”
11926	11932	11916	11916	She	381	“ Lovely to meet you . ”
11939	11952	11953	11953	She	381	“ Come through , and I ’ll show you to your desk . ”
11984	12002	12003	12003	she	381	“ As you know , each floor of this building is a different arm of the company , ”
12009	12038	12039	12039	I	2959	“ We have internationals and magazines from floor twenty down . Floors thirty to forty are news and current affairs , and above forty are television and cable . ”
12043	12100	12039	12039	I	2959	“ The two top levels of the building are senior management only , and your security card wo n’t get you up there . It ’s customary for new employees to be taken on a guided tour of the building , and Lindsey from human resources will come and get you at two o’clock this afternoon . ”
12101	12106	12107	12107	I	2959	“ Okay , great . ”
12128	12157	12158	12158	She	381	“ Most people start on level four and work their way up the building , so congratulations for starting on level forty . That in itself is amazing . ”
12162	12166	12167	12167	I	2959	“ Thank you , ”
12190	12196	12171	12171	She	381	“ This is your desk . ”
12197	12200	12201	12201	I	2959	“ Oh . ”
12236	12239	12240	12241	a man	2300	“ Hello , ”
12252	12257	12258	12258	He	2300	“ I ’m Aaron . ”
12270	12276	12258	12258	He	2300	“ You must be Emily . ”
12277	12282	12283	12283	I	2959	“ Hi , Aaron , ”
12290	12301	12302	12302	Frances	73	“ I ’ll leave you in Aaron ’s safe hands . ”
12305	12309	12302	12302	Frances	73	“ Thank you . ”
12310	12316	12317	12317	She	73	“ Have a great day . ”
12339	12344	12345	12345	Aaron	0	“ Are you excited ? ”
12348	12357	12358	12358	I	2959	“ Oh my God , I ’m petrified , ”
12366	12384	12385	12385	He	0	“ I ’ve never done this job before . I usually find the stories with my group . ”
12389	12422	12385	12385	He	0	“ Do n’t worry ; we all felt the same when we started , but they would n’t have given you the job if they did n’t think you could do it . ”
12430	12441	12442	12442	He	0	“ I just do n’t want to let anyone down . ”
12454	12470	12442	12442	He	0	“ You wo n’t . This team is great , and we help each other . ”
12480	12483	12484	12484	He	0	“ Oh . ”
12494	12522	12484	12484	He	0	“ I ’m totally gay and way too touchy , apparently . Tell me if I get in your space . I have no sphere of reference . ”
12531	12534	12523	12523	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
12545	12553	12535	12535	I	2959	“ How long have you worked here ? ”
12554	12562	12563	12563	He	0	“ Four years . I love it . ”
12572	12588	12563	12563	He	0	“ Best job I ’ve ever had . I moved from San Fran for it . ”
12589	12595	12596	12596	I	2959	“ I moved from California . ”
12600	12606	12607	12607	he	0	“ You here by yourself ? ”
12610	12613	12614	12614	I	2959	“ Yeah . ”
12617	12632	12614	12614	I	2959	“ I got a little one - bedroom apartment . I arrived on Friday . ”
12633	12641	12642	12642	he	0	“ What did you do all weekend ? ”
12645	12651	12652	12652	He	0	“ Freaked out about today . ”
12655	12666	12667	12667	I	2959	“ Do n’t worry . We ’ve all been there . ”
12677	12685	12667	12667	I	2959	“ Who else do we work with ? ”
12686	12689	12690	12690	He	0	“ Molly . ”
12698	12723	12724	12724	I	2959	“ She does n’t start until nine thirty . She ’s a single mom and has to get her kids off to school first . ”
12731	12748	12749	12749	I	2959	“ And Ava — she ’s just late because she probably went out last night partying . ”
12757	12781	12752	12752	He	0	“ She ’s a deplorable party girl , and she ’s never at her desk — always finds somewhere she has to be . ”
12782	12785	12786	12787	a girl	387	“ Hello , ”
12811	12816	12802	12802	She	387	“ I ’m Ava . ”
12824	12829	12830	12830	Ava	77	“ I ’m Emily . ”
12857	12874	12875	12875	Aaron	0	“ Open up your computer , Emily , and I ’ll show you through our programs , ”
12878	12881	12882	12882	I	2959	“ Okay , ”
12891	12898	12899	12899	Ava	77	“ Oh my God , Aaron , ”
12902	12912	12899	12899	Ava	77	“ I met the hottest fucking guy last night . ”
12913	12918	12919	12919	Aaron	0	“ Here we go . ”
12922	12932	12919	12919	Aaron	0	“ You meet the hottest fucking guy every night . ”
12943	12954	12933	12933	I	2959	“ No , seriously , this time I mean it . ”
12997	13008	13009	13009	I	2959	“ At ten o’clock the stories will start coming in . ”
13013	13044	13045	13045	I	2959	“ We , as reporters , go through them and all say yay or nay as to whether it ’s got legs and if we go and report on it . ”
13048	13056	13045	13045	I	2959	“ But how will I know that ? ”
13057	13071	13072	13072	Ava	77	“ We just vote yes for stuff that interests us , I suppose , ”
13075	13098	13099	13099	She	77	“ Obviously , news stories that are breaking are crucial , but it ’s the other content that they pay us for . ”
13104	13124	13125	13125	She	77	“ For example , three coffee shops have closed down in one week within two blocks from each other . ”
13130	13143	13144	13144	I	2959	“ Honestly , who gives a fuck ? This is n’t news . ”
13147	13152	13153	13153	Aaron	0	“ Here ’s one . ”
13157	13199	13200	13200	Ava	77	“ A driver has been clocked traveling at one hundred fifty - five miles per hour , and he ran a police stop sign . He was involved in a hot pursuit and ended up crashing into parked cars in Brooklyn . ”
13203	13210	13200	13200	Ava	77	“ Yeah , that ’s good . ”
13211	13218	13219	13219	He	0	“ We ’ll go with that . ”
13231	13238	13239	13239	I	2959	“ So how does this work ? ”
13242	13326	13327	13327	I	2959	“ We collect stories , and then we discuss collectively what each of us has done and put together a list of stories . You research your stories and have them in by four each day for the next day ’s news . Then we send them on to Hayden , and he sends them to editing . Obviously , if a good story comes in , it will take priority over everything else , and it will go to live news immediately . ”
13333	13347	13327	13327	I	2959	“ So we each get our own stories and leads sent to us ? ”
13348	13360	13361	13361	I	2959	“ Yes , by email . By others on this level . ”
13371	13388	13389	13389	Ava	77	“ We keep our finger on the pulse of what sells and what news really is , ”
13392	13400	13401	13401	I	2959	“ It ’s the coolest job ever . ”
13411	13416	13417	13417	Aaron	0	“ Open your emails . ”
13438	13445	13446	13446	I	2959	“ Those are all possible stories ? ”
13449	13452	13453	13453	He	0	“ Yes . ”
13460	13473	13453	13453	He	0	“ Get reading , baby . They come in thick and fast . ”
13482	13508	13474	13474	I	2959	“ Just make sure you get story details right . Nothing pisses management off more than incorrect names . You will get into huge trouble . ”
13509	13513	13514	13514	I	2959	“ Got it . ”
13526	13550	13474	13474	I	2959	“ Hi , Emily , this is Lindsey from human resources . I ’ll be up in about five minutes to get you , ”
13575	13581	13582	13582	I	2959	“ Okay , thank you . ”
13586	13599	13600	13600	I	2959	“ Oh no , I have to go on the office tour , ”
13606	13611	13612	13612	Aaron	0	“ That ’s okay , ”
13621	13629	13630	13630	I	2959	“ I ’ve got so many leads , ”
13633	13640	13630	13630	I	2959	“ I ca n’t keep up . ”
13641	13650	13651	13651	he	0	“ Do n’t worry . It ’s fine , ”
13655	13665	13651	13651	he	0	“ What if I miss a really important story ? ”
13666	13684	13630	13630	I	2959	“ You won’t — it ’s fine . I ’ll go through yours while you ’re gone . ”
13685	13688	13630	13630	I	2959	“ Really ? ”
13689	13706	13651	13651	he	0	“ Of course it is . You are n’t expected to know everything on day one . ”
13707	13719	13720	13720	Ava	77	“ Oh no , you have to go to the top . ”
13723	13729	13730	13730	I	2959	“ What ’s the top ? ”
13733	13739	13730	13730	I	2959	“ Upper - management offices . ”
13740	13746	13651	13651	he	0	“ They ’re not nice ? ”
13747	13768	13730	13730	I	2959	“ No , they ’re fucking horrible , and you have a good chance of being fired on the spot . ”
13769	13772	13730	13730	I	2959	“ What ? ”
13773	13778	13779	13779	Aaron	0	“ Oh , bullshit . ”
13784	13792	13793	13793	He	0	“ They just do n’t . . . ”
13804	13835	13793	13793	He	0	“ They do n’t fluff . If something is going to be said , they just say it how it is . They do n’t take any shit from anyone . ”
13836	13841	13842	13842	I	2959	“ Who are they ? ”
13845	13866	13842	13842	I	2959	“ Well , Mr. Miles wo n’t be there . He never is . I think he ’s in London . ”
13867	13871	13872	13872	I	2959	“ Mr. Miles ? ”
13881	13885	13872	13872	I	2959	“ The CEO . ”
13886	13919	13842	13842	I	2959	“ Yes , I know who he is . I think everyone does . Although I ’ve never seen a picture of him . It ’s him and his brothers , right ? ”
13920	13938	13947	13947	I	2959	“ Yes , it ’s the Miles family who owns everything . He and his three brothers . ”
13939	13946	13947	13947	I	2959	“ And they ’re all upstairs ? ”
13970	13983	13984	13984	Ava	77	“ Just do n’t say anything stupid up in the management levels , ”
13991	14001	14002	14002	I	2959	“ Like what ? What do they consider stupid ? ”
14009	14027	14002	14002	I	2959	“ Just keep your mouth shut , take the tour , and do n’t tell HR anything . ”
14028	14032	14002	14002	I	2959	“ Why not ? ”
14033	14075	14082	14082	I	2959	“ Because they ’re on speed dial to the management levels . This whole tour you ’re taking now is just so they can do a personality assessment on you in the two hours it takes them to show you around . ”
14076	14081	14082	14082	I	2959	“ Oh my God . ”
14085	14097	14082	14082	I	2959	“ Hi , Emily , is it ? I ’m Lindsey . ”
14116	14119	14120	14120	She	393	“ Hello . ”
14126	14145	14120	14120	She	393	“ Let ’s get started . We will go down to level one and work our way up . ”
14177	14192	14193	14193	I	2959	“ And this is the gymnasium , for our staff ’s own personal use . ”
14208	14211	14193	14193	I	2959	“ Wow . ”
14212	14267	14193	14193	I	2959	“ It ’s open from six in the morning until six thirty at night . It ’s busiest before work , obviously , but you can come here on your lunch break also . A lot of people take a late or early lunch so that it ’s not as busy when they come . ”
14309	14317	14318	14318	Lindsey	74	“ Okay , let ’s get going . ”
14321	14332	14318	14318	Lindsey	74	“ We will head up to the management floors now . ”
14355	14364	14346	14346	She	74	“ Oh look , you ’re in luck . ”
14370	14376	14377	14377	I	2959	“ Mr. Miles is here . ”
14382	14392	14377	14377	I	2959	“ I ’ll take you to meet him first . ”
14469	14474	14475	14475	Lindsey	74	“ Hello , Sammia . ”
14505	14510	14489	14491	A beautiful woman	404	“ Hello , Lindsey . ”
14511	14526	14527	14527	Sammia	246	“ This is Emily . She ’s new and started on level forty today . ”
14535	14543	14527	14527	Sammia	246	“ Lovely to meet you , Emily . ”
14544	14551	14552	14552	Lindsey	74	“ Is Mr. Miles taking visitors ? ”
14555	14559	14560	14560	She	74	“ He is . ”
14563	14570	14560	14560	She	74	“ I ’ll just announce you . ”
14595	14611	14589	14589	Sammia	246	“ Mr. Miles , we have a new staff member to meet you in reception . ”
14620	14625	14626	14626	She	74	“ Yes , sir . ”
14632	14637	14626	14626	She	74	“ Just go in . ”
14638	14644	14645	14645	Lindsey	74	“ This way , Emily . ”
14772	14776	14782	14782	Lindsey	74	“ Come in , ”
14816	14830	14831	14831	Lindsey	74	“ Emily Foster , I would like to introduce you to Mr. Miles , ”
14866	14871	14856	14856	he	246	“ Hello , Emily . ”
14922	14926	14929	14929	him	246	“ Jameson Miles . ”
14963	14973	14974	14974	Lindsey	74	“ Emily , tell Mr. Miles all about yourself , ”
14985	14988	14974	14974	Lindsey	74	“ Oh . ”
14997	15003	15004	15004	His	246	“ I ’m Emily Foster . ”
15054	15060	15061	15061	he	246	“ Welcome to Miles Media , ”
15065	15068	15061	15061	he	246	“ Thanks , ”
15101	15119	15082	15082	she	74	“ I ’ll take it from here , Lindsey . Emily will be out in a moment , ”
15132	15137	15124	15124	Lindsey	74	“ I ’ll just — ”
15138	15142	15143	15143	he	246	“ Wait outside , ”
15152	15157	15158	15158	she	74	“ Yes , sir , ”
15212	15217	15206	15206	His	246	“ Hello , Emily . ”
15228	15231	15218	15218	I	2959	“ Hi . ”
15299	15309	15310	15310	he	246	“ Given any poor unsuspecting travel companions hickeys lately ? ”
15344	15353	15354	15354	I	2959	“ Yes , just last night , actually . ”
15359	15365	15354	15354	I	2959	“ On my flight here . ”
15378	15385	15386	15386	I	2959	“ So you ’re not Jim ? ”
15389	15397	15386	15386	I	2959	“ To some people I ’m Jim . ”
15398	15412	15413	15413	He	246	“ Women you pick up for one - night stands , you mean . ”
15425	15432	15413	15413	He	246	“ What ’s with the attitude ? ”
15433	15441	15442	15442	I	2959	“ I do n’t have an attitude , ”
15577	15586	15587	15587	he	246	“ What are you doing in New York ? ”
15590	15596	15587	15587	he	246	“ Working for Miles Media . ”
15779	15786	15787	15787	I	2959	“ Nice to see you again . ”
15817	15821	15822	15822	Lindsey	74	“ All done ? ”
15825	15828	15829	15829	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
15851	15857	15858	15858	Lindsey	74	“ Do n’t feel rattled , ”
15870	15888	15862	15862	I	2959	“ He ’s very abrasive and not good with people , but his mind is beyond incredible . ”
15893	15898	15899	15899	I	2959	“ Oh , okay , ”
15908	15913	15899	15899	I	2959	“ Good to know . ”
15914	15922	15899	15899	I	2959	“ Did he say anything to you ? ”
15923	15926	15927	15927	I	2959	“ No , ”
15930	15935	15936	15936	She	74	“ Just polite chitchat . ”
15939	15956	15936	15936	She	74	“ You should feel very privileged . Jameson Miles does n’t make polite chitchat with anyone . ”
15957	15960	15961	15961	I	2959	“ Oh . ”
15977	15987	15969	15969	I	2959	“ Thank you so much for showing me around . ”
15988	16007	15936	15936	She	74	“ You ’re welcome , and if you have any human resource issues , please call me immediately . ”
16008	16012	16013	16013	I	2959	“ I will . ”

16062	16068	16053	16053	I	2959	“ Back in a moment . ”
16767	16773	16774	16774	Aaron	0	“ How was the tour ? ”
16777	16782	16783	16783	I	2959	“ Yeah , good . ”
16791	16801	16783	16783	I	2959	“ Did you go up to the top levels ? ”
16802	16807	16808	16808	I	2959	“ Uh - huh . ”
16838	16844	16845	16845	Aaron	0	“ What about the offices ? ”
16848	16861	16862	16862	I	2959	“ They ’re something else , right ? All that white marble . ”
16873	16878	16862	16862	I	2959	“ Uh - huh . ”
16879	16893	16894	16894	Molly	198	“ I did n’t get to see the management offices when I started , ”
16897	16906	16907	16907	I	2959	“ He was n’t taking visitors that day . ”
16913	16926	16927	16927	Aaron	0	“ I went into his office , but he was n’t there , ”
16931	16939	16927	16927	Aaron	0	“ Who ? Jameson , you mean ? ”
16949	16959	16940	16940	I	2959	“ Yeah , did you see him at all ? ”
16960	16963	16964	16964	I	2959	“ Yep . ”
16969	16974	16975	16975	I	2959	“ I met him . ”
16982	16989	16990	16990	Molly	198	“ Was he a rude pig ? ”
16993	17001	16990	16990	Molly	198	“ Everyone is so scared of him . ”
17002	17020	17033	17033	Aaron	0	“ No , he seemed fine . I was in his office , and he seemed okay . ”
17021	17032	17033	17033	Aaron	0	“ You were in his office while he was there ? ”
17036	17041	17042	17042	I	2959	“ Uh - huh . ”
17052	17060	17061	17061	Molly	198	“ What are you guys doing tonight ? ”
17064	17088	17061	17061	Molly	198	“ The kids are with their dad , and I could do with pizza and beer . Screw the diet and the gym . ”
17089	17096	17097	17097	Aaron	0	“ Yeah , I ’m in , ”
17100	17103	17104	17104	I	2959	“ Really ? ”
17121	17135	17136	17136	Molly	198	“ Yeah , why not ? Do you have anything else going on ? ”
17139	17165	17166	17166	I	2959	“ Well , seeing as you two are the only people I know in New York , what else could I possibly have going on ? ”
17170	17177	17178	17178	Molly	198	“ Pizza and beer it is , ”
17274	17279	17280	17280	I	2959	“ What the hell ? ”
17283	17286	17287	17287	Molly	198	“ What ? ”
17290	17293	17287	17287	Molly	198	“ Nothing , ”
17513	17519	17520	17520	Molly	198	“ All I ’m saying , ”
17528	17553	17523	17523	she	198	“ is that if you did n’t see him all weekend , and he has no problem with that , there ’s an issue . ”
17554	17561	17562	17562	Aaron	0	“ Maybe he was just busy , ”
17565	17572	17573	17573	Molly	198	“ Maybe he ’s just lame , ”
17606	17612	17613	17613	I	2959	“ Well , get this . ”
17618	17674	17675	17675	I	2959	“ You want to hear lame ? I ’m dating a guy I ’ve crushed on since I was thirteen years old . A football star who was only interested in me after he injured himself . We had a few great months together , but then he dove into some kind of life crisis . ”
17680	17716	17675	17675	I	2959	“ He does n’t know what he wants to do outside of football . He ’s unemployed with no prospects . He lives in his parents ’ garage and just recently wrote his car off . ”
17732	17763	17766	17766	my	2959	“ He would n’t move here with me because he does n’t like busy cities . He did n’t call me this morning to wish me luck , and it ’s now”—I
17767	17787	17788	17788	They	466	watch—“nine forty p.m. , and he has n’t even bothered to call to see how my first day went . ”
17794	17804	17805	17805	Aaron	0	“ What the fuck are you doing with him ? ”
17819	17823	17824	17824	They	466	“ Who knows ? ”
17828	17839	17840	17840	Molly	198	“ Well , all I want is some good sex . ”
17843	17869	17870	17870	I	2959	“ Every time I see someone I ’m attracted to , I ’m with the kids . So then I ca n’t act on it . ”
17873	17883	17870	17870	I	2959	“ You would n’t introduce anyone to your kids ? ”
17884	17902	17903	17903	Aaron	0	“ No . My God , they make their father ’s life hell with his new girlfriend . ”
17910	17913	17914	17914	I	2959	“ What ? ”
17920	17933	17934	17934	I	2959	“ My children are so fucking naughty you would n’t even believe . ”
17937	17943	17934	17934	I	2959	“ How old are they ? ”
17944	17954	17955	17955	she	198	“ Mischa is thirteen , and Brad is fifteen , ”
17958	17988	17955	17955	she	198	“ They ’ve decided between the two of them that they are going to make life a living hell for their father and me unless we get back together . ”
17989	17993	17994	17994	I	2959	“ How so ? ”
17997	18043	18044	18044	I	2959	“ Brad has been suspended from school twice this year , and now Mischa is going off the rails too . A few weekends ago they each had a friend stay over at their father ’s while he and his girlfriend went out to dinner . ”
18050	18070	18071	18071	Aaron	0	“ They got drunk from his bar and cut the crotches out of all of his girlfriend ’s underwear . ”
18081	18082	18084	18084	her	467	“ And”—she
18085	18106	18107	18107	I	2959	drink—“when their father asked them about it , they said that the underpants had rotted because her vagina was contaminated . ”
18112	18115	18116	18116	She	467	“ No . ”
18123	18130	18116	18116	She	467	“ I wish I was joking . ”
18139	18153	18131	18131	Aaron	0	“ I fucking love your kids , man . That ’s a classic . ”
18154	18162	18163	18163	she	467	“ No , it ’s a nightmare , ”
18167	18174	18175	18175	I	2959	“ Why did you divorce him ? ”
18178	18188	18189	18189	She	467	“ You know , I do n’t actually know . ”
18195	18228	18229	18229	She	467	“ We just kind of lost our way . We were both working so hard , so we were always too tired for sex . We had two kids and a mortgage . ”
18232	18268	18229	18229	She	467	“ We never went on date nights or made an effort for each other . I do n’t have a precise moment that we knew it was over . We just kind of fell apart . ”
18269	18274	18275	18275	I	2959	“ That ’s sad . ”
18278	18322	18275	18275	I	2959	“ He met someone else at work , and he talked to me about it . Nothing had happened at that stage , and he said he told me because he wanted to fight for us to get back what we once had . ”
18323	18329	18330	18330	I	2959	“ You did n’t fight ? ”
18333	18336	18337	18337	she	467	“ No , ”
18341	18366	18367	18367	She	467	“ And neither did he . We just kind of walked away from each other . It was all too hard at the time . ”
18373	18427	18428	18428	She	467	“ I regret it now . He ’s a great man . And in hindsight , I think a lot of the problems we had just come from getting older . Sex drive is something you both need to work at , but we did n’t realize that until it was too late . ”
18432	18439	18428	18428	She	467	“ We ’re great friends now . ”
18447	18462	18463	18463	Aaron	0	“ Lucky you ’ve got those kids to cut up your competition ’s underwear . ”
18472	18485	18466	18466	We	468	“ Contaminated vagina . Where do they come up with this shit ? ”
18859	18862	18855	18855	he	56	“ Hey . ”
18863	18866	18867	18867	I	2959	“ Hi . ”
18870	18875	18867	18867	I	2959	“ How are you ? ”
18876	18879	18880	18880	he	56	“ Sleeping , ”
18883	18889	18880	18880	he	56	“ What time is it ? ”
18900	18903	18880	18880	he	56	“ Sorry . ”
18904	18918	18919	18919	My	2959	“ Yeah , no matter . I ’ll call you tomorrow , babe . ”
18923	18926	18927	18927	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
18930	18936	18927	18927	I	2959	“ Sorry to wake you . ”
18937	18940	18941	18941	He	56	“ Bye . ”
18949	18963	18964	18964	I	2959	“ My first day at work went great ; thank you for asking , ”
19153	19156	19131	19131	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
19157	19170	19171	19171	I	2959	“ We have an Emily Foster here to see you , sir . ”
19185	19190	19182	19182	she	186	“ Send her up . ”
19233	19236	19228	19228	she	186	“ Hello . ”
19240	19243	19244	19244	she	186	“ Hi , ”
19262	19267	19268	19268	She	186	“ Please come through . ”
19324	19329	19330	19330	I	2959	“ Take a seat , ”
19451	19458	19459	19459	she	186	“ You wanted to see me ? ”
19498	19501	19490	19490	her	186	“ Yes . ”
19507	19511	19512	19512	Emily	186	“ I did . ”
19551	19555	19547	19547	Jim	266	“ What about ? ”
19583	19592	19593	19593	I	2959	“ What are you doing in New York ? ”
19603	19610	19611	19611	she	186	“ You asked me that yesterday , ”
19614	19620	19611	19611	she	186	“ Get to the point . ”
19621	19635	19636	19636	She	186	“ I am asking you again now . Stop with the fucking attitude . ”
19651	19657	19658	19658	I	2959	“ What is your problem ? ”
19661	19669	19658	19658	I	2959	“ You . You are my problem . ”
19670	19673	19674	19674	I	2959	“ Me ? ”
19679	19685	19674	19674	I	2959	“ What did I do ? ”
19686	19703	19704	19704	I	2959	“ Do you have something work related to talk to me about or not , Jim ? ”
19709	19715	19704	19704	I	2959	“ You ’re very rude . ”
19716	19722	19674	19674	I	2959	“ You ’re very rich . ”
19723	19726	19727	19727	She	186	“ And ? ”
19730	19736	19737	19737	I	2959	“ What does that mean ? ”
19740	19743	19744	19744	She	186	“ Nothing . ”
19749	19769	19744	19744	She	186	“ If you do n’t have anything work related to talk to me about , I ’ll get going . ”
19786	19793	19794	19794	Her	186	“ Can I see you tonight ? ”
19799	19802	19794	19794	Her	186	“ No . ”
19803	19807	19827	19827	I	2959	“ Why not ? ”
19808	19826	19827	19827	I	2959	“ Because I ’m a professional , and I have no intention of mixing business and pleasure . ”
19847	19859	19837	19837	My	2959	“ What makes you so sure it would be a pleasure ? ”
19860	19869	19870	19870	she	186	“ History has a way of repeating itself , ”
19908	19923	19924	19924	I	2959	“ History will be kind to me , for I intend to write it , ”
19927	19936	19937	19937	she	186	“ Quoting Winston Churchill now , Mr. Miles ? ”
19948	19961	19940	19940	I	2959	“ You must look at the facts because they look at you . ”
19962	19973	19974	19974	she	186	“ I never worry about action , but only inaction , ”
19980	19999	20000	20000	She	186	“ Exactly , so as a fellow Churchill tragic , I demand you have dinner with me tonight . ”
20005	20010	20000	20000	She	186	“ I ca n’t . ”
20011	20015	19940	19940	I	2959	“ Why not ? ”
20016	20023	20000	20000	She	186	“ I ’m washing my hair . ”
20024	20040	20041	20041	She	186	“ Why would you want to wash it when you could be getting it dirty ? ”
20045	20060	20061	20061	I	2959	“ I ’m just not interested in you . You ’re not my type . ”
20100	20107	20091	20091	I	2959	“ Very well ; your loss . ”
20108	20111	20112	20112	She	186	“ Maybe . ”
20117	20135	20112	20112	She	186	“ Nice to see you again , though . You must be very proud of your achievements . ”
20167	20172	20153	20153	I	2959	“ Goodbye , Emily . ”
20173	20176	20177	20177	she	186	“ Goodbye , ”
20186	20194	20195	20195	She	186	“ Thanks for giving me a job . ”
20262	20269	20246	20246	I	2959	“ Get me the fortieth floor , ”
20300	20304	20293	20293	she	186	“ Follow her . ”
20324	20330	20331	20331	I	2959	“ Camera above that area , ”
20401	20405	20395	20395	She	186	“ Zoom in , ”
20441	20447	20448	20448	Aaron	0	“ What about this one ? ”
20451	20460	20461	20461	I	2959	“ Hot firefighter rescues kitten from a drain . ”
20464	20473	20474	20474	He	0	“ I ’ll do that story for sure . ”
20477	20481	20474	20474	He	0	“ Me too . ”

20540	20571	20572	20572	I	2959	“ Well , I was supposed to , but I ’ve spoken to him for four minutes in total in ten days , and he has n’t called me once . ”
20584	20598	20599	20599	I	2959	“ God , you need to dump him and move on to Ricardo . ”
20628	20634	20635	20635	Molly	198	“ He ’s into you , ”
20638	20649	20635	20635	Molly	198	“ He ’s hanging around your desk like a fly . ”
20650	20656	20657	20657	I	2959	“ It ’s a shame . ”
20670	20678	20679	20679	Ricardo	246	“ He ’s actually very good looking . ”
20727	20730	20731	20731	Aaron	0	“ Yuck . ”
20738	20748	20731	20731	Aaron	0	“ What would you even talk to him about ? ”
20749	20768	20769	20769	Ava	77	“ You would n’t talk to him — you’d stick a ball gag in and fuck him stupid , ”
20776	20786	20787	20787	she	77	“ I bet he ’s hung like a horse , ”
20796	20804	20805	20805	I	2959	“ What are you doing this weekend ? ”
20809	20817	20818	20818	Aaron	0	“ She ’ll be chasing rich boys , ”

20853	20856	20857	20857	I	2959	“ Why ? ”
20860	20871	20857	20857	I	2959	“ I am not ending up with a broke loser . ”
20879	20893	20872	20872	My	2959	“ So . . . you would marry a guy just for money ? ”
20894	20897	20898	20898	She	77	“ No . ”
20901	20904	20905	20905	She	77	“ Maybe . ”
20909	20917	20918	20918	she	77	“ Oh no , here he comes , ”
20955	20959	20960	20960	He	266	“ Hey there . ”
20963	20966	20967	20967	I	2959	“ Hi , ”
20978	20990	20991	20991	I	2959	“ Ricardo wanted to come and check on his favorite coworker . ”
21003	21015	21016	21016	I	2959	“ Why do you speak about yourself in the third person ? ”
21028	21042	21022	21022	he	266	“ Ricardo wonders why you never come to his desk to see him . ”
21043	21052	21053	21053	I	2959	“ Emily likes to get her work done , ”
21057	21060	21061	21061	He	266	“ Oh . ”
21069	21077	21078	21078	I	2959	“ Ricardo likes your style , Emily . ”

27741	27776	27777	27777	He	56	“ Robbie , come back to New York with me . There are so many jobs there , and it would be a fresh start for you . We could discover the city together . ”

29446	29449	29383	29387	this woman of sound mind	581	“ Yes . ”
29450	29455	29368	29368	she	581	“ What happened then ? ”
29456	29506	29383	29387	this woman of sound mind	581	“ My son got my house acid washed and removed it , but three nights later it happened again . But this time it was an image of someone getting murdered . A woman had been stabbed . The graffiti was so intricate that it looked like a painting . ”
29507	29510	29511	29511	I	2959	“ Oh . ”
29517	29525	29511	29511	I	2959	“ What did you do this time ? ”
29526	29552	29383	29387	this woman of sound mind	581	“ I went down to the police station and demanded someone come and look at my house . My neighbor had his house vandalized too . ”
29553	29556	29557	29557	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
29563	29571	29557	29557	I	2959	“ What ’s your neighbor ’s name ? ”

29635	29641	29642	29642	She	586	“ I forgot his name . ”
29658	29686	29642	29642	She	586	“ That ’s okay . I ’ll just write Robert Day Daniels for the moment , and then we ’ll come back to it a little later . ”
29687	29692	29693	29693	She	586	“ Yes , okay . ”
29708	29716	29717	29717	I	2959	“ What was drawn on his house ? ”
29720	29728	29717	29717	I	2959	“ One of those horrible devil stars . ”
29729	29744	29693	29693	She	586	“ I see . Tell me , what did the police do this time ? ”
29745	29756	29717	29717	I	2959	“ Nothing . They did n’t even come out here . ”
29757	29763	29764	29764	I	2959	“ They ’re very busy , ”
29771	29781	29764	29764	I	2959	“ Tell me about the last time it happened . ”
29782	29790	29791	29791	I	2959	“ The entire house was painted red . ”
29797	29804	29791	29791	I	2959	“ The entire house was red ? ”
29805	29810	29814	29814	me	2959	“ The whole street . ”
29816	29821	29822	29822	I	2959	“ That is weird . ”
29837	29846	29847	29847	she	586	“ Do you think it ’s the devil ? ”
29850	29853	29854	29854	I	2959	“ What ? ”
29857	29868	29869	29869	I	2959	“ No , it ’s probably just kids acting up , ”
29877	29886	29869	29869	I	2959	“ Have you told anyone else about this ? ”
29887	29922	29923	29923	I	2959	“ No , only Miles Media . I want you to publish this story so that the police will actually pay some attention . I ’m getting scared that it ’s something more sinister . ”
29930	29945	29923	29923	I	2959	“ Yes , I think we have enough to go forward with the story . ”
29946	29954	29955	29955	She	586	“ Oh , thank you , dear . ”
29961	29975	29976	29976	I	2959	“ Is there anything else you can think of that may be relevant ? ”
29979	30007	29976	29976	I	2959	“ Just that I ’m living in fear every night that the devil is coming back . My neighbors said to go and speak to them too . ”
30008	30013	30014	30014	I	2959	“ Okay , great . ”
30020	30032	30014	30014	I	2959	“ If you think of anything else , please call me . ”

31216	31251	31213	31213	I	2959	“ Not a soul . The street and I made a collective decision that we only wanted Miles Media to report on it . That way we knew the police would have to listen . ”
31269	31274	31213	31213	I	2959	“ Coffee for Emily , ”

31812	31820	31821	31821	I	2959	“ But it ’s the weirdest thing , ”
31824	31842	31843	31843	He	186	“ Today the Gazette has published the same story . . . with my error in it . ”
31846	31849	31843	31843	He	186	“ What ? ”
31850	31884	31885	31885	I	2959	“ Look , I do n’t know , and I could be totally wrong , and I do n’t know why I ’m even telling you this , but I think . . . ”
31888	31893	31894	31894	he	186	“ You think what ? ”
31897	31945	31946	31946	I	2959	“ I just know for certain that the Gazette did n’t get that story themselves , and they most definitely could n’t make the same mistake as I have . The old lady in the story contacted me directly because she would only talk to Miles Media . ”
31976	31981	31960	31960	he	186	“ Are you sure ? ”
31982	31991	31992	31992	I	2959	“ Positive . I got the name wrong . ”
32003	32010	32011	32011	Jameson	186	“ This here is my error . ”
32035	32051	32023	32023	he	186	“ Thank you . I ’ll discuss this with Tristan and get back to you . ”
32052	32055	32056	32056	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
32059	32079	32056	32056	I	2959	“ I ’m sorry for making the error . It was unprofessional , and it wo n’t happen again . ”
32099	32104	32105	32105	he	186	“ Goodbye , Emily , ”
32116	32119	32111	32111	he	186	“ Goodbye . ”
32179	32182	32170	32170	My	2959	“ Hello . ”

32340	32364	32365	32365	he	186	“ Yes , I ’ve spoken to Tristan , and we have a special project that we would like you to work on , ”
32375	32379	32368	32368	he	186	“ You do ? ”
32380	32393	32394	32394	I	2959	“ Yes . We want you to write a story to publish . ”
32402	32405	32406	32406	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
32409	32416	32417	32417	Jameson	186	“ What ’s the story on ? ”
32425	32439	32417	32417	Jameson	186	“ I was thinking . . . something along the lines of lovebites . ”
32445	32449	32440	32440	I	2959	“ Love bites ? ”
32465	32473	32440	32440	I	2959	“ Lovebites , one word . Plural . ”
32526	32550	32516	32516	I	2959	“ I think I ’m better equipped to write a story on premature ejaculation . That way you could help me with it . ”
32562	32567	32555	32555	Jameson	186	“ Is that so ? ”
32568	32571	32572	32572	I	2959	“ Yes , ”
32577	32593	32594	32594	Amusement	121	“ News stories are so much better when they have evidence to back them up . ”
32640	32648	32634	32634	I	2959	“ Did you ever think of me ? ”
32683	32689	32690	32690	he	186	“ How was your weekend ? ”
32693	32696	32697	32697	His	186	“ Fine . ”
32701	32705	32706	32706	I	2959	“ Just fine ? ”
32709	32714	32706	32706	I	2959	“ Uh - huh . ”
32741	32748	32731	32731	I	2959	“ You got back Sunday night ? ”
32749	32752	32753	32753	His	186	“ Yes . ”
32775	32781	32782	32782	I	2959	“ How was your weekend ? ”

32821	32835	32789	32789	he	186	“ I had great hot sex with a gorgeous , great woman all weekend ”
32840	32845	32846	32846	Tristan	2430	“ Sorry about that , ”
32863	32868	32869	32869	He	186	“ I ’m Tristan . ”

32978	32989	32971	32971	Tristan	2430	“ What time is it ? Has happy hour started ? ”
32990	32997	32998	32998	Jameson	186	“ Four thirty , and yes , ”
33022	33031	33016	33016	He	186	“ Would you like a drink , Emily ? ”

33198	33223	33224	33224	I	2959	“ Yes . In light of what you told me this morning , we want you to write a story for us to publish . ”
33232	33235	33236	33236	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
33241	33248	33236	33236	I	2959	“ What ’s the story on ? ”

33277	33307	33267	33267	I	2959	“ We have a secret project coming up , and I wanted you to be involved , but I need to know if you can report on a subject . ”
33308	33327	33255	33255	His	2959	“ You know I can . I ’ve worked for regional papers for five years as a reporter . ”
33328	33336	33337	33337	Tristan	2430	“ This is strictly off the record , ”
33340	33352	33337	33337	Tristan	2430	“ You can not tell a soul . It ’s imperative . ”
33353	33358	33359	33359	I	2959	“ I wo n’t , ”
33367	33406	33407	33407	I	2959	“ For some time , we have thought that somebody on your floor is selling our stories to our competitors so that they are breaking before us . What you told us this morning all but confirms it . ”
33410	33416	33407	33407	I	2959	“ How do you know ? ”
33417	33424	33425	33425	Jameson	186	“ Trust me ; we know , ”
33428	33444	33445	33445	I	2959	“ Our stocks are falling and so is our credibility . It needs to stop . ”
33451	33484	33445	33445	I	2959	“ We want you to make up a fake news story and submit it through the normal channels , and we will see if it turns up in our competitor ’s papers . ”
33500	33507	33490	33490	I	2959	“ What would I write about ? ”
33508	33533	33445	33445	I	2959	“ Something worth selling . It does n’t have to be real . The faker the better — then it ’s more easily traceable . ”
33534	33542	33543	33543	I	2959	“ Who do you think it is ? ”
33604	33618	33588	33588	I	2959	“ We have no idea , but we know it ’s not you . ”
33619	33626	33636	33636	Jameson	186	“ How do you know that ? ”
33627	33635	33636	33636	Jameson	186	“ Because it began before you started , ”
33647	33650	33639	33639	he	186	“ Okay . ”
33657	33663	33664	33664	I	2959	“ I could do that . ”
33669	33678	33664	33664	I	2959	“ When do you want the story by ? ”
33679	33686	33639	33639	he	186	“ Tomorrow afternoon , if possible . ”
33687	33690	33664	33664	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
33698	33708	33709	33709	He	186	“ Tristan , you have London on line two . ”
33716	33728	33709	33709	He	186	“ Give me a moment to get back to my office . ”
33729	33732	33733	33734	the receptionist	625	“ Okay , ”
33737	33763	33764	33764	he	186	“ Sorry , I have to take this call . We are settling today on a new company . We ’ll talk more tomorrow afternoon , ”
33767	33770	33771	33771	I	2959	“ Sure . ”
33792	33810	33811	33811	He	186	“ Remember , not a word to anyone . I would hate to have to fire you . ”
33834	33837	33827	33827	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
33838	33847	33848	33848	he	186	“ I look forward to reading your story , ”
33923	33932	33933	33933	I	2959	“ I should get back to my desk , ”
33955	33965	33951	33951	he	186	“ Is there anything else you wanted , sir ? ”
33985	33993	33994	33994	He	186	“ Yes , actually . There is . ”
34037	34043	34044	34044	he	186	“ Can you feel that ? ”
34054	34067	34068	34068	he	186	“ I ’m so sexually attracted to you that it ’s insane , ”

45345	45354	45330	45330	Jameson	186	“ I needed to be at work early . ”
45355	45364	45365	45365	I	2959	“ You did n’t think to wake me ? ”
45368	45374	45365	45365	I	2959	“ You piss me off . ”
45375	45394	45330	45330	Jameson	186	“ Do n’t start your righteous shit with me . I ’ll leave when I fucking want to . ”
45539	45582	45528	45528	I	2959	“ I do n’t know what the fuck you ’re playing at , Emily Foster , but I wo n’t have it . If you ’re with me , you ’re with me . And you ’ll do as I fucking say . ”
45622	45629	45630	45630	Alan	246	“ Good morning , Mr. Miles . ”
45641	45644	45633	45633	he	246	“ Morning , ”

45828	45848	45850	45851	Matthew Price	139	“ With this filing , we have officially linked Stoneface to an individual known as the Red Ribbon Killer , ”
45938	45941	45944	45944	Emily	186	“ Fuck . ”

45993	45996	46022	46022	Chloe	135	“ Nope . ”
45997	46001	46002	46002	He	2430	“ Fucking hell . ”
46005	46010	46002	46002	He	2430	“ See you soon . ”
46119	46122	46123	46123	I	2959	“ Hello . ”
46126	46148	46149	46149	They	2616	“ Jesus , you ’ve both got uglier since I last saw you . I did n’t think it was possible . ”
46224	46231	46216	46216	I	2959	“ What the hell is this ? ”
46232	46236	46237	46237	Tristan	2430	“ Fucking hell , ”
46250	46256	46257	46257	Elliot	140	“ What ’s going on ? ”
46260	46267	46268	46268	I	2959	“ I do n’t believe this . ”
46272	46283	46284	46284	Tristan	2430	“ We got a new staff member , Emily Foster . ”
46293	46296	46297	46297	Christopher	141	“ And ? ”
46300	46341	46342	46342	They	2616	“ She ran a story on her second day and was n’t sure of the name of the suspect , so she made one up on the spot and planned on changing it when she got back to the office . ”
46348	46353	46342	46342	They	2616	“ Only she forgot . ”
46354	46357	46358	46358	Elliot	140	“ Jesus . ”
46363	46366	46358	46358	Elliot	140	“ Useless . ”
46367	46370	46371	46371	Tristan	2430	“ No , ”
46374	46396	46397	46397	Elliot	140	“ Diabolical . The exact same story ran in the Gazette the next day . . . with the bogus name . ”
46405	46412	46413	46413	Christopher	141	“ How do you know this ? ”
46416	46428	46429	46429	I	2959	“ I know the reporter . We met a while ago . ”
46437	46444	46445	46445	Tristan	2430	“ You know who she is ? ”
46448	46451	46445	46445	Tristan	2430	“ Who ? ”
46459	46470	46471	46471	Their	2616	“ Remember ages ago Jay got a motherfucking huge hickey ? ”
46475	46478	46479	46479	Elliot	140	“ No . ”
46487	46497	46498	46498	He	140	“ Please . . . do n’t tell me . ”
46503	46513	46498	46498	He	140	“ What did you call it ? Stopover shame . ”
46514	46526	46527	46527	I	2959	“ I had to wear a fucking turtleneck for two weeks . ”
46532	46544	46527	46527	I	2959	“ Remember the black - tie dinner for Mom ’s charity ? ”
46553	46565	46566	46566	He	140	“ And you had the hugest hickey anyone had ever seen . ”
46572	46598	46566	46566	He	140	“ And you had to hide from Mom all night and wear cover - up on your neck . That was fucking hilarious , man . ”
46599	46602	46603	46603	I	2959	“ Mortifying . ”
46610	46618	46603	46603	I	2959	“ Anyway , back to the story . ”
46628	46686	46619	46619	I	2959	“ Emily — that ’s her name — unbeknownst to me got a job here . She started three weeks ago , and then this mishap with the name happened . She came to me with suspicions that something fishy was going on . A fake name that she made up on the spot was no coincidence . ”
46694	46705	46687	46687	I	2959	“ Our stories are being sold on the black market . ”
46706	46712	46713	46713	Elliot	140	“ For fuck ’s sake , ”
46716	46730	46731	46731	Elliot	140	“ Our share prices are dropping because we are no longer breaking news . ”
46738	46753	46754	46754	Tristan	2430	“ Because the reporters that we are paying for are working for our competition , ”
46757	46784	46785	46785	I	2959	“ We tested the theory this week . We got Emily to write a bogus story and submit it through the regular channels , and look . ”
46796	46807	46785	46785	I	2959	“ Here it is , page three of the Gazette . ”
46823	46833	46808	46808	They	799	“ So . . . what do we do ? ”
46834	46841	46842	46842	I	2959	“ Firing everyone works for me , ”
46845	46872	46873	46874	The boys	801	“ No , we have to do this properly . There are a hundred people on that floor . Not to mention IT and the mailroom . ”
46889	46901	46884	46884	I	2959	“ Can we get Richard from legal up here , please ? ”
46902	46907	46884	46884	I	2959	“ Yes , sir . ”
46908	46922	46923	46923	Elliot	140	“ Should Emily write another story so we can track it more closely ? ”
46926	46929	46930	46930	I	2959	“ No , ”
46933	46952	46953	46953	Tristan	2430	“ I do n’t want her involved again . I do n’t want her up here at all . ”
46956	46972	46973	46973	I	2959	“ I ’m going to wipe that stupid smirk off your face in a minute , ”
46976	46987	46988	46988	Elliot	140	“ Scared she ’s going to give you another hickey ? ”
46991	47001	47002	47002	They	802	“ Must have some pretty good suction going on . ”
47011	47027	47006	47006	I	2959	“ Cut the shit . I ’m not in the fucking mood for this today . ”
47036	47040	47041	47041	I	2959	“ Come in , ”
47049	47055	47044	47044	Richard	246	“ Please take a seat . ”
47056	47063	47064	47064	He	140	“ How can I help you ? ”
47067	47094	47095	47095	Richard	246	“ We have reason to believe that someone on the news floor is selling our stories to a competitor . How do we legally handle this ? ”
47103	47108	47095	47095	Richard	246	“ Are you sure ? ”
47109	47112	47117	47117	He	140	“ Yes . ”
47113	47116	47117	47117	He	140	“ Well . ”
47123	47132	47117	47117	He	140	“ You would hire a corporate investigation firm . ”
47133	47139	47140	47140	I	2959	“ What do they do ? ”
47143	47183	47140	47140	I	2959	“ They are business - centric and can involve verifying the legitimacy of a business partner or deal , looking into loss or theft of proprietary information , identifying the potential of a damaged reputation , things like that . ”
47184	47187	47188	47188	I	2959	“ No , ”
47194	47221	47188	47188	I	2959	“ I do n’t want a stranger in here sniffing around . What if the story breaks ? It will do more damage to our reputation . ”
47222	47241	47242	47242	Richard	246	“ With all due respect , Jameson , I do n’t see how you have any other choice , ”
47245	47251	47252	47252	Tristan	2430	“ Do you know any ? ”
47255	47267	47252	47252	Tristan	2430	“ No . But I can find out who to use . ”
47268	47275	47303	47303	Richard	246	“ I do n’t like it . ”
47276	47302	47303	47303	Richard	246	“ They ’re professionals . They deal with things like this all the time . You wo n’t even know they are in the building , ”
47306	47312	47303	47303	Richard	246	“ How does it work ? ”
47313	47332	47333	47333	I	2959	“ They usually come in undercover , act as one of the workers while they watch and trace . ”
47340	47352	47333	47333	I	2959	“ How ridiculous . This is n’t a fucking MacGyver episode . ”
47385	47388	47389	47389	Emily	186	“ Fine . ”
47852	47855	47856	47856	I	2959	“ Hi , ”
47859	47862	47863	47863	Aaron	0	“ Hey . ”
47871	47877	47863	47863	Aaron	0	“ How did it go ? ”
47890	47893	47894	47894	I	2959	“ Good , ”
47897	47910	47894	47894	I	2959	“ I ’ll tell you about it tonight . We are drinking . ”
47911	47914	47887	47887	he	0	“ Drinking ? ”
47915	47920	47921	47921	His	0	“ Everything we see . ”
47925	47937	47921	47921	His	0	“ Oh . . . it went that kind of good . ”
47938	47941	47942	47942	I	2959	“ Precisely , ”
47946	47955	47956	47956	Aaron	0	“ What ’s going on around here today ? ”
47959	47965	47956	47956	Aaron	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
47973	47989	47966	47966	I	2959	“ Tristan is buzzing around , and Jameson has been down to the floor already . ”
47990	47996	47997	47997	I	2959	“ What time is it ? ”
48003	48025	47997	47997	I	2959	“ It ’s only eight forty - five . They are never down here at this hour , if at all . ”
48026	48030	48035	48035	I	2959	“ I know . ”
48031	48034	48035	48035	I	2959	“ Hmm . ”
48056	48064	48065	48065	I	2959	“ Do you think something ’s wrong ? ”
48068	48083	48084	48084	I	2959	“ I do n’t know . Did you piss Mr. J off last night ? ”
48087	48096	48084	48084	I	2959	“ Maybe he ’s upstairs throwing a tantrum . ”
48097	48106	48107	48107	I	2959	“ I ’m probably about to get fired . ”
48141	48146	48147	48147	I	2959	“ Who are they ? ”
48159	48172	48150	48150	Molly	198	“ Oh Lord have mercy . . . thank you , God . ”
48173	48176	48177	48177	I	2959	“ Huh ? ”
48180	48208	48177	48177	I	2959	“ That ’s Elliot and Christopher Miles . They ’ve flown in from the UK . Must be a board meeting or something going on this week . ”
48213	48218	48219	48219	She	198	“ Jameson ’s brothers ? ”
48227	48232	48233	48233	She	198	“ Uh - huh . ”
48245	48250	48233	48233	She	198	“ I call Elliot . ”
48251	48259	48260	48260	he	0	“ Good , because I call Christopher , ”
48265	48277	48278	48278	she	198	“ Can you please set us up on a brother date ? ”
48281	48290	48291	48291	Aaron	0	“ Yes , and we need to swing , ”
48294	48306	48291	48291	Aaron	0	“ Because I want all four . I ca n’t choose . ”
48307	48312	48313	48313	Molly	198	“ Can you imagine ? ”
48316	48325	48326	48326	She	198	“ Makes me blush just thinking of it . ”
48343	48360	48361	48361	I	2959	“ Imagine all of them in bed together . . . taking turns with your body . ”
48368	48380	48381	48381	They	824	“ The Miles brothers are overrated , if you ask me . ”
48484	48498	48499	48499	Molly	198	“ Oh my God , did you see the story in the Gazette ? ”
48502	48507	48499	48499	Molly	198	“ No , what ? ”

48536	48556	48499	48499	Molly	198	“ Yeah , it ’s one of their lead stories today . I was reading it online just now . ”
48557	48563	48564	48564	I	2959	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
48673	48688	48670	48671	Thieving bastard	56	“ I ’ve got to go and see someone . Back in a minute . ”

48724	48730	48731	48732	the receptionist	625	“ Excuse me , Emily , ”
48735	48744	48731	48732	the receptionist	625	“ He ’s not taking visitors right now . ”

48764	48767	48768	48768	he	56	“ Yes ? ”
48791	48796	48797	48797	he	56	“ What is it ? ”

48818	48821	48855	48855	He	56	“ And ? ”
48822	48849	48855	48855	He	56	“ Well . . . why did n’t you tell me ? It was my story . I thought you would have at least told me . ”
48850	48854	48855	48855	He	56	“ Ms. Foster . ”
48867	48879	48855	48855	He	56	“ I do n’t have time to play your juvenile games . ”
48880	48886	48855	48855	He	56	“ What does that mean ? ”
48887	48895	48896	48896	He	56	“ It means I ’m very busy . ”
48912	48923	48928	48929	this man	56	“ Close the door on your way out , please . ”
48958	48968	48975	48975	he	56	“ Who the hell do you think you are ? ”
48969	48974	48975	48975	he	56	“ Here we go , ”
48981	48984	48975	48975	he	56	“ What ? ”

49124	49129	49130	49130	I	2959	“ You know what ? ”
49140	49147	49148	49148	He	56	“ You can go fuck yourself . ”
49153	49195	49148	49148	He	56	“ Not that it ’s any of your business , but Chloe is my masseuse . I had an appointment with her last night that I was n’t home for . Those text messages came through hours after she sent them . ”
49208	49218	49219	49219	He	56	“ Do not check my fucking phone ever again . ”

49312	49324	49290	49290	He	56	“ That is none of your business . Now get out . ”
49603	49606	49607	49607	He	2430	“ Emily ? ”

50984	51010	51011	51011	she	198	“ So you know how Brad got caught messaging that girl . I took his phone from him because his father would n’t do it , ”
51014	51017	51011	51011	she	198	“ Yeah . ”
51018	51036	51011	51011	she	198	“ Well , he was angry , but he was n’t that pissed off , you know ? ”
51037	51043	51011	51011	she	198	“ What do you mean ? ”
51044	51074	51075	51075	I	2959	“ Well , he was n’t hassling me for his phone back all the time like normal , and he wanted to go to bed really early last night . ”
51081	51119	51120	51120	Aaron	0	“ I felt like something was off , so I checked the hiding spot to see if his phone was still there , and it was . Then I had this strange thought to check the SIM . ”
51131	51148	51120	51120	Aaron	0	“ The little shit had taken the SIM out and put it into an old phone . ”
51149	51154	51120	51120	Aaron	0	“ Oh , crap . ”
51155	51221	51222	51222	My	2959	“ I barge into his bedroom , and sure enough , he is on his phone , and it is hidden under the covers . I snatch it off him and lock myself in the bathroom while I go through it . He ’s banging the door down , so I know there is something on there that he does n’t want me to see . ”
51229	51233	51234	51234	she	877	“ Get this , ”
51237	51248	51249	51249	I	2959	“ Pure little Chanel has been sending him nudes too . ”
51252	51269	51270	51270	We	878	“ This fifteen - year - old little girl is built like a fucking Penthouse Pet . ”
51273	51280	51281	51281	she	877	“ Oh , it gets worse , ”
51284	51301	51281	51281	she	877	“ While I ’m looking through his phone , a new message comes through from her . ”
51302	51307	51361	51361	she	877	“ What was it ? ”
51308	51320	51321	51321	My	2959	“ I got a Brazilian like you wanted . You like ? ”
51326	51333	51321	51321	My	2959	“ Can you believe that message ? ”
51344	51360	51361	51361	she	877	“ I would find this funny , too , if it were n’t my child , ”
51371	51414	51415	51415	She	877	“ Then Brad had a complete meltdown and told me that if I call Chanel ’s parents , I ’m effectively committing social suicide for him as his whole reputation will be ruined and that he ’s never going to school again . ”
51425	51430	51431	51431	Aaron	0	“ That ’s true , ”
51434	51442	51431	51431	Aaron	0	“ You ca n’t call her mother . ”
51443	51462	51463	51463	she	877	“ So it ’s all right for her to call me , but I ca n’t call her ? ”
51466	51472	51473	51473	I	2959	“ I do n’t know , ”
51476	51486	51473	51473	I	2959	“ I probably would n’t call her mother either . ”
51487	51495	51496	51496	she	877	“ Well , what would you do ? ”
51499	51516	51517	51517	She	877	“ I ’d buy him a box of condoms , that ’s what I ’d do . ”
51525	51534	51535	51535	I	2959	“ Because imagine if he got her pregnant , ”
51538	51543	51544	51544	She	877	“ Oh my God . ”
51552	51565	51544	51544	She	877	“ I ca n’t deal with boys . They are so stupid . ”
51566	51578	51579	51579	Aaron	0	“ The amount of testosterone in a male teenager is ridiculous , ”
51583	51597	51598	51598	Molly	198	“ I was jerking off four times a day when I was fifteen . ”
51603	51609	51610	51610	I	2959	“ Four times a day ? ”
51613	51620	51621	51621	He	2959	“ Do n’t girls do that ? ”
51626	51629	51630	51630	we	330	“ No , ”
51634	51639	51640	51640	I	2959	“ Men are gross . ”

51685	51706	51678	51678	she	198	“ Mr. Miles asked me to let you know that you have a meeting in his office in an hour . ”
51707	51732	51678	51678	she	198	“ I ’m very busy today . Can you tell Mr. Miles that , unfortunately , I wo n’t be able to make it ? ”
51733	51755	51756	51756	I	2959	“ He told me that your attendance is mandatory , and he ’s already spoken to your manager to get clearance . ”
51764	51775	51756	51756	I	2959	“ Fine . I ’ll be there . Thank you . ”

51929	51937	51938	51938	I	2959	“ What do you want , Jameson ? ”
51941	51951	51938	51938	I	2959	“ I do n’t have time for your games . ”
51952	51961	51962	51962	I	2959	“ I want you to look at me . ”
51969	51980	51962	51962	I	2959	“ Why do n’t you want to look at me ? ”
51989	52002	52003	52003	He	186	“ Because I just find your face really . . . punchable . ”
52015	52020	52003	52003	He	186	“ Is that so ? ”
52021	52027	52028	52028	I	2959	“ Yeah , it is . ”

52072	52084	52085	52085	I	2959	“ Like you said , it ’s none of my business . ”
52098	52108	52085	52085	I	2959	“ I was going to call you last night . ”
52118	52131	52132	52132	He	186	“ Do n’t waste your time . I would n’t have answered . ”
52152	52159	52132	52132	He	186	“ Why are you so snarky ? ”
52160	52192	52193	52193	He	186	“ I ’m not snarky . I ’m just not about to put up with shit from an entitled asshole . You may be a CEO here , but . . . ”
52204	52212	52193	52193	He	186	“ Finish what you wanted to say . ”

52232	52245	52246	52246	he	186	“ I may be the CEO here . . . but what ? ”
52255	52309	52249	52249	he	186	“ I was n’t angry with you on Friday . I left in the middle of the night because I was confused . . . about a lot of things . I was going to talk to you when I was thinking clearly because I did n’t want to be a drama queen . ”
52315	52342	52343	52343	He	186	“ And then I came to your office , and you treated me like a two - bit whore that you ejaculated in the night before . ”
52348	52371	52343	52343	He	186	“ I ’m nobody ’s whore , Jameson , least of all yours . No job is worth my self - respect . ”
52378	52398	52399	52399	He	186	“ So excuse me if the privilege of sucking your golden CEO dick does n’t excite me any longer . ”
52416	52427	52399	52399	He	186	“ Were you on the debating team , Ms. Foster ? ”
52428	52438	52439	52439	I	2959	“ What does that have to do with anything ? ”
52444	52451	52452	52452	He	186	“ You make a good argument . ”
52465	52468	52458	52458	he	186	“ Impressive . ”
52530	52533	52534	52534	I	2959	“ Please , ”
52540	52544	52534	52534	I	2959	“ Please what ? ”
52545	52569	52534	52534	I	2959	“ Please stop insulting my intelligence . Run your meeting so I can get back to work . You ’re wasting my time . ”

52728	52760	52698	52698	Elliot	140	“ Okay . So as per our meeting on Friday , we have recruited a private corporate investigator to work on your floor and get to the bottom of this mess . ”
52761	52764	52765	52765	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
52770	52784	52785	52785	I	2959	“ What we want you to do is keep sending in bogus stories . ”
52788	52791	52785	52785	I	2959	“ Why ? ”
52792	52816	52817	52817	I	2959	“ Because if there are a lot of stories going through that are bogus , it will be easier for us to trace . ”
52826	52833	52834	52834	Tristan	2430	“ And as you can see — ”
52843	52847	52848	52848	He	186	“ Stop there . ”
52855	52862	52848	52848	He	186	“ What is it , Emily ? ”

52887	52909	52879	52879	My	2959	“ With all due respect , Mr. Miles , I did n’t apply for my dream job to do bogus stories . ”
52910	52914	52915	52915	he	186	“ Fair point , ”
52926	52938	52939	52939	I	2959	“ What ’s going to happen when this is all over ? ”
52942	52951	52939	52939	I	2959	“ You will return to your normal duties . ”
52952	52962	52963	52963	I	2959	“ I would like that in writing , please , ”
52979	52983	52984	52984	He	140	“ Very well . ”
52992	52996	52984	52984	He	140	“ Please continue . ”
52997	53023	53024	53024	I	2959	“ The investigator will be starting next week on Monday , and Emily , we would like you to be his eyes on the floor . ”
53027	53040	53024	53024	I	2959	“ I do n’t really want to get involved in all this . ”
53041	53054	53055	53055	Jameson	186	“ You involved yourself the moment you stepped through my office door , ”
53065	53088	53058	53058	I	2959	“ Emily , if you could give us a few bogus stories to start with next Monday , that would be great . ”
53089	53101	53102	53102	Jameson	186	“ Okay , what would you like me to write about ? ”
53108	53123	53124	53124	I	2959	“ The first story I would like to be about a fake prostitution racket . ”
53129	53139	53144	53145	this man	56	“ Call the ringleader a two - bit whore . ”
53147	53150	53151	53151	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
53155	53167	53151	53151	I	2959	“ I have enough material to work with on that one . ”
53168	53171	53172	53172	Tristan	2430	“ Good . ”
53175	53190	53172	53172	Tristan	2430	“ Work on those stories , and we will touch base next Monday afternoon . ”
53191	53196	53197	53197	I	2959	“ Yes , okay , ”

53424	53431	53432	53432	he	186	“ Can I see you tonight ? ”
53446	53455	53435	53435	I	2959	“ No , Jameson , you ca n’t . ”
53577	53587	53588	53588	I	2959	“ Why are we waiting here in line again ? ”
53591	53600	53588	53588	I	2959	“ What was wrong with the last place ? ”
53601	53618	53623	53623	I	2959	“ Nothing . This place is better , but it does n’t heat up until eleven . ”
53619	53622	53623	53623	I	2959	“ Oh . ”
53818	53824	53807	53807	I	2959	“ This place is insane . ”

63807	63844	63744	63744	he	717	“ I did n’t mean that I do n’t want to see you . I meant that I am a workaholic , and I know that very few women can deal with how much I work . ”

64018	64043	64052	64052	he	717	“ This defensive shit . It has to stop between us . We ca n’t keep fighting over every little thing like we do . ”
64044	64051	64052	64052	he	717	“ You ’re just as bad , ”
64056	64085	64098	64098	he	717	“ I know , and I ’m trying to stop it . Just now I held my tongue because you ordered my drink without asking what I wanted . ”
64086	64097	64098	64098	he	717	“ I ’m used to being in control , Emily , ”
64101	64110	64098	64098	he	717	“ So am I. That wo n’t change . ”

64147	64203	64144	64144	I	2959	“ That ’s not what this is about . We have a great sexual connection , and I want it . I feel like I have to have it . . . but I ca n’t , not if I know you have it with other women . I need to be the only one . ”
64204	64215	64216	64216	he	717	“ Fine , I wo n’t sleep with anyone else , ”
64221	64224	64216	64216	he	717	“ And ? ”

64248	64259	64245	64245	I	2959	“ This is n’t about the stupid drinks , Jameson . ”
64260	64276	64245	64245	I	2959	“ What is it about , then , for Christ ’s sake ? Speak English . ”
64277	64288	64245	64245	I	2959	“ I want you to drop being defensive with me . ”
64289	64294	64245	64245	I	2959	“ I ’m not . ”
64295	64301	64302	64302	I	2959	“ Yes , you are , ”
64312	64317	64302	64302	I	2959	“ So are you . ”
64318	64339	64340	64340	His	717	“ I know I am , because I feel like you will walk all over me if I ’m not . ”
64344	64353	64340	64340	His	717	“ I would never walk all over you . ”
64354	64358	64359	64359	He	717	“ Not purposely . ”
64374	64393	64394	64394	His	717	“ I just want the guy I met on the plane . The one who let himself go . ”
64399	64425	64394	64394	His	717	“ I do n’t know how to be that guy all the time , Em . It ’s a very small part of my personality . ”
64426	64436	64437	64437	I	2959	“ Then just save that small part for me , ”
64457	64471	64452	64452	he	717	“ What was so good about that guy on the plane , anyway ? ”
64472	64478	64479	64479	I	2959	“ He made me laugh . ”
64485	64497	64479	64479	I	2959	“ And he gave me the best sex of my life . ”
64498	64504	64452	64452	he	717	“ Of your entire life ? ”
64505	64510	64511	64511	He	717	“ Uh - huh . ”
64518	64526	64527	64527	I	2959	“ So do we have a deal ? ”
64530	64550	64527	64527	I	2959	“ Let me get this straight — you want to have friends with benefits but only with each other ? ”
64551	64554	64452	64452	he	717	“ Yes . ”
64555	64576	64577	64577	His	717	“ What happens when I ’m at work all the time or away and you ’re out and . . . ”
64582	64595	64596	64596	His	717	“ Then I ’ll call you and tell you I need you . ”
64601	64622	64623	64623	He	717	“ And you ’ll talk me through it over the phone , or I ’ll wait till you come home . ”
64639	64674	64675	64675	He	717	“ I do n’t want to have sex with anyone else , Jameson . I ’m not that kind of girl . You are the only one - night stand I ’ve ever had . ”
64685	64705	64706	64706	He	717	“ I ’ve had sex with four people in my whole life , and you ’re one of them . ”
64717	64720	64706	64706	He	717	“ What ? ”
64721	64733	64734	64734	I	2959	“ Do you know how often I think about fucking you ? ”
64742	64746	64734	64734	I	2959	“ How often ? ”
64747	64763	64706	64706	He	717	“ All the time . I ’m like a starstruck eighteen - year - old . ”
64764	64771	64706	64706	He	717	“ You would n’t know it . ”
64772	64775	64734	64734	I	2959	“ Why ? ”
64776	64797	64798	64798	He	717	“ You acted like you hated me all week . You can be so cold when you want to be . ”
64809	64841	64798	64798	He	717	“ I do n’t like to be challenged for the sake of it , Emily . You fought with me last weekend just to prove a point . It angered me . ”
64842	64898	64899	64899	He	1064	“ No . I fought with you last weekend because I wanted to spend the day at my apartment , and you just assumed that your place was better than mine . Your money does n’t impress me , Jameson . I do n’t care for your fancy apartment . Mine is just as good . ”
64904	64916	64917	64917	I	2959	“ Are we going to fight now about why we fought ? ”
64928	64935	64920	64920	He	1064	“ No . No more fighting . ”

66086	66091	66092	66092	He	186	“ Well . . . ”
66099	66110	66111	66111	I	2959	“ We just play it by ear , I guess . ”

66301	66321	66281	66281	He	186	“ Because I hate waiting around , and then we know not to plan anything else on our days . ”
66322	66325	66326	66326	He	186	“ Okay . ”
66334	66343	66326	66326	He	186	“ When do you want to see me ? ”
66344	66355	66356	66356	I	2959	“ Maybe twice through the week and once on weekends . ”
66365	66377	66356	66356	I	2959	“ But only a few hours each time , of course . ”
66378	66381	66326	66326	He	186	“ No . ”

66492	66523	66524	66524	He	186	“ And then we ’re going to come back to bed , and I ’m going to fuck you stupid again to get me through another few days without you . ”
66532	66535	66536	66536	he	186	“ Okay ? ”
66583	66591	66592	66592	he	186	“ Go back to sleep , sweetheart , ”
66668	66679	66680	66680	He	186	“ Where the hell did you run to , Antarctica ? ”
66692	66701	66702	66702	He	186	“ You must really run hard , huh ? ”
66713	66724	66702	66702	He	186	“ The harder I run , the better the effects . ”
66725	66730	66731	66731	I	2959	“ Effects on what ? ”
66734	66739	66740	66740	He	186	“ My stress levels . ”
66777	66783	66784	66784	he	186	“ Are you getting in ? ”
66787	66790	66791	66791	I	2959	“ Yes , ”

66888	66893	66894	66894	I	2959	“ Your princess Em . ”
66917	66935	66906	66906	he	186	“ I have no doubt that underneath all that snarky Ms. Foster act is a pure sweetheart . ”
66936	66944	66945	66945	I	2959	“ I have n’t been snarky once , ”
66964	66972	66954	66954	he	186	“ And look how beautiful you are . ”
67082	67088	67077	67078	Jameson Miles	186	“ Let me wash you . ”
67188	67199	67200	67200	I	2959	“ You ’ve turned me into a complete sex maniac , ”
67214	67236	67203	67203	He	56	“ I think you already suffered that affliction before we met — if our first night was anything to go by . ”
67237	67246	67203	67203	He	56	“ I ’ve never been like this before . ”
67247	67251	67203	67203	He	56	“ Like what ? ”
67252	67265	67266	67266	My	2959	“ You bring something out in me that no other man has . ”
67271	67283	67266	67266	My	2959	“ You ’re different from anyone I ’ve ever been with . ”
67376	67385	67386	67386	he	56	“ I ’m taking you back to bed , ”
67390	67393	67386	67386	he	56	“ Please , ”
67477	67483	67484	67484	he	56	“ I want it slow , ”

67706	67709	67703	67703	he	56	“ What ? ”
67710	67725	67726	67726	My	2959	“ Stay still , and take it from me . Clench your orgasm in . ”
67746	67750	67751	67751	he	56	“ Fuck me , ”
67754	67765	67766	67766	He	56	“ Do n’t move a muscle , except for here . ”
67778	67795	67766	67766	He	56	“ I want you to show me , just me . . . how you feel . ”
67796	67800	67801	67801	I	2959	“ Oh God , ”

67835	67842	67824	67824	I	2959	“ That ’s it , baby . ”
67849	67861	67843	67843	His	56	“ Milk me , and show me who it belongs to . ”
67902	67909	67897	67897	He	56	“ So . . . good , ”

68084	68089	68090	68090	He	56	“ Why is that ? ”
68093	68101	68102	68102	He	56	“ I think I may be addicted . ”
68115	68123	68124	68124	I	2959	“ No , I want you addicted . ”
68127	68135	68124	68124	I	2959	“ Why would you want me addicted ? ”
68136	68152	68153	68153	His	56	“ Because I am , and I do n’t want to be in this alone . ”
68170	68180	68159	68159	I	2959	“ You ’re not in this alone , Jay . ”
68181	68184	68185	68185	He	56	“ Good . ”

68476	68483	68466	68466	I	2959	“ Your apartment freaks me out . ”
68484	68487	68488	68488	I	2959	“ Why ? ”
68497	68512	68513	68513	He	56	“ It ’s so fancy . I feel like I do n’t belong here . ”
68520	68526	68527	68527	I	2959	“ What does that mean ? ”
68530	68544	68545	68545	I	2959	“ Is that why you did n’t want to come here last weekend ? ”
68548	68551	68545	68545	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
68552	68558	68545	68545	I	2959	“ Explain to me why ? ”
68559	68578	68545	68545	I	2959	“ When I ’m here , I ’m reminded of how much we do n’t have in common . ”
68579	68585	68586	68586	I	2959	“ And that bothers you ? ”
68599	68615	68590	68590	He	56	“ You ’re the first woman who ’s ever had a problem with my money . ”
68616	68624	68545	68545	I	2959	“ It ’s a turnoff to me . ”
68625	68628	68629	68629	he	56	“ Turnoff ? ”
68632	68643	68644	68644	I	2959	“ I would prefer you to be poor , actually . ”
68656	68665	68666	68666	He	56	“ Well , that makes one of us . ”

68810	68841	68842	68842	He	56	“ Playing golf with my brothers this afternoon , and then I ’ll probably have dinner with them and my parents . They go back to London this week sometime . ”
68847	68850	68851	68851	I	2959	“ You ? ”
68863	68884	68885	68885	He	56	“ I have to food shop . I ’ll go for a walk and then write some bogus news stories . ”
68889	68903	68885	68885	He	56	“ You do n’t have to work on the weekend , you know . ”
68904	68922	68923	68923	He	56	“ I know . I just like to be ahead of schedule in case something comes up . ”
68932	68939	68940	68940	he	56	“ Are you going out tonight ? ”
68964	68970	68971	68971	His	56	“ Yes , I am . ”

69010	69029	68971	68971	His	56	“ My friend I work with , the one who sits next to me . He ’s gay . ”
69030	69033	69034	69034	He	56	“ Oh . ”
69057	69068	69069	69069	He	56	“ Would it bother you if I were going clubbing ? ”
69079	69099	69069	69069	He	56	“ Well , if your performance from last weekend is anything to go by , yes , it would . ”
69104	69107	69100	69100	I	2959	“ What ? ”
69108	69111	69112	69112	I	2959	“ Nothing . ”
69138	69154	69122	69122	He	56	“ I ’m not sharing you . I do n’t want you dancing with anybody . ”
69173	69181	69165	69165	I	2959	“ Good , then I wo n’t . ”

75385	75388	75389	75389	I	2959	“ Ugh , ”
75406	75422	75423	75423	I	2959	“ Can you go out of the room so I can drug your food now ? ”
75426	75434	75435	75435	He	246	“ I plan on robbing your place . ”
75438	75454	75455	75455	I	2959	“ Only if you promise to take advantage of my body while I ’m sleeping . ”
75458	75461	75462	75462	I	2959	“ Deal . ”

75606	75610	75603	75603	He	246	“ New York . ”
75611	75624	75577	75577	He	246	“ You ’ve never had a girlfriend who cooked for you before ? ”
75625	75643	75644	75644	He	246	“ I ’ve only ever had one serious relationship , and she was a workaholic like me . ”
75647	75663	75664	75664	I	2959	“ We would both get home too late from work . Eating out was easier . ”
75710	75715	75699	75699	He	246	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
75716	75722	75723	75723	He	246	“ My back ’s tight . ”
75733	75742	75723	75723	He	246	“ Somebody insisted on me firing my masseuse . ”
75743	75748	75749	75749	I	2959	“ Oh , her , ”
75752	75768	75769	75769	He	246	“ Do n’t ruin my night . I ’ll find you a new masseuse tomorrow . ”
75774	75778	75769	75769	He	246	“ Please do . ”
75779	75788	75789	75789	He	246	“ Why does your back get so tight ? ”
75794	75805	75789	75789	He	246	“ When I get wound up , my back tightens . ”
75806	75816	75817	75817	He	246	“ What else happens when you get wound up ? ”
75827	75836	75837	75837	I	2959	“ My temper gets the best of me . ”
75841	75844	75845	75845	He	246	“ What ? ”
75848	75867	75868	75868	He	246	“ All this time I thought you were an asshole , when really you were just stressed out ? ”
75871	75882	75883	75883	I	2959	“ And what ’s your excuse for being a bitch ? ”
75888	75898	75899	75899	He	246	“ Nothing . I really am just a bitch . ”

75972	75976	75977	75977	he	246	“ You did ? ”
75982	75987	75977	75977	he	246	“ Uh - huh . ”
75988	75993	75942	75942	I	2959	“ I run fast . ”
75994	76002	75977	75977	he	246	“ Good , because I walk slow . ”
76016	76021	76022	76022	he	246	“ You did not , ”
76028	76033	76025	76025	I	2959	“ Uh - huh . ”
76055	76060	76061	76061	He	246	“ What on earth ? ”

76099	76152	76153	76153	He	246	“ It was my first car , and I ’d only had it a week . I was driving with my friend , and the day was as hot as hell . We were on our way to buy some cheap jeans from a market , and the temperature gauge started overheating . ”
76159	76183	76184	76184	I	2959	“ We pulled into a service station , and I called my dad , and he told me to put oil in it . ”
76187	76213	76184	76184	I	2959	“ But we did n’t know where the oil went , so we assumed it went in the little hole that you measure it from . ”
76214	76218	76219	76219	he	246	“ The dipstick ? ”
76224	76235	76236	76236	I	2959	“ How on earth did you get it in there ? ”
76250	76266	76267	76267	I	2959	“ We borrowed a funnel and then poured it in , and it overflowed everywhere . ”
76280	76303	76304	76304	His	246	“ We thought it was fine and started driving , and then oil we ’d spilled on the engine caught on fire . ”
76308	76312	76304	76304	His	246	“ What happened ? ”
76313	76343	76344	76344	We	1176	“ My beloved five - hundred - dollar car that I saved up for a year for was frigging totaled in just one week ; that ’s what happened . ”
76370	76384	76385	76385	He	76	“ You must have done something stupid in your life , Jameson Miles . ”
76395	76401	76385	76385	He	76	“ Yeah . I have . ”
76402	76405	76406	76406	I	2959	“ What ? ”
76429	76437	76421	76421	his	76	“ I never asked for your number . ”
76440	76448	76449	76449	Jameson	186	“ Will you hurry up , woman ? ”
76482	76488	76489	76489	He	76	“ What ’s the rush ? ”
76505	76518	76519	76519	He	76	“ God , you ’re so perky and energetic in the morning . ”
76550	76558	76559	76559	He	76	“ How do you run so fast ? ”
76570	76587	76588	76588	He	76	“ Well , what I do is I imagine someone is chasing me with an ax . ”
76596	76599	76600	76600	I	2959	“ What ? ”
76603	76609	76610	76610	He	76	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
76619	76635	76636	76636	He	76	“ Your relaxation tool is to imagine someone is chasing you with a fucking ax . ”
76643	76654	76636	76636	He	76	“ It works . I run much faster that way . ”
76655	76663	76664	76664	I	2959	“ This is all making sense now , ”
76667	76676	76664	76664	I	2959	“ The puzzle is falling into place here . ”
76677	76681	76636	76636	He	76	“ What puzzle ? ”
76682	76701	76702	76702	He	76	“ Your back is tight because your masseuse continually puts it out so she can fuck you again . ”
76705	76718	76719	76719	He	76	“ Your relaxation exercise is to be chased by an ax murderer . ”
76722	76743	76744	76744	He	76	“ And you go out seven nights a week . No wonder you ’re stressed out , you crazy bastard . ”
76761	76777	76744	76744	He	76	“ Lucky I have you to fuck me calm , then , is n’t it ? ”
76778	76782	76783	76783	I	2959	“ Damn straight , ”
76814	76829	76830	76830	he	76	“ What exercise would you recommend I do ? For relaxing , I mean , ”
76848	76852	76842	76842	I	2959	“ Aqua aerobics . ”
76853	76856	76857	76857	He	76	“ Ha . ”
76860	76867	76857	76857	He	76	“ I ’m not that old . ”
76868	76874	76875	76875	I	2959	“ You ’re pretty old , ”
76878	76886	76875	76875	I	2959	“ Do you want to race me ? ”
76887	76890	76857	76857	He	76	“ No . ”
76891	76895	76857	76857	He	76	“ Why not ? ”
76896	76923	76924	76924	He	76	“ Because that murderer has his ax in my lungs , and I ’m about to die at any second . I hope you know resuscitation . ”
76927	76930	76931	76931	He	76	“ Wimp . ”
77025	77032	77017	77017	she	198	“ You coming out this weekend ? ”
77036	77055	77056	77056	Jeez	93	“ Um , I ’m not sure what I ’m doing yet . I might be going home . ”

77216	77222	77223	77223	Jameson	186	“ Look who ’s coming . ”
77335	77348	77349	77349	Ava	77	“ Seriously , where do we find men like the Miles brothers ? ”
77352	77355	77349	77349	Ava	77	“ Right ? ”
77364	77370	77371	77371	she	77	“ One of these days , ”
77374	77380	77371	77371	she	77	“ One of these days . ”
77426	77442	77443	77443	Hayden	266	“ Hi , Emily , have you got your stories we are running with tomorrow ? ”
77454	77471	77446	77446	I	2959	“ I did n’t think they were due until four , and it ’s only three . ”
77495	77508	77509	77509	he	266	“ I know , but I like to get a head start , ”
77545	77552	77535	77535	he	266	“ They ’re not ready yet . ”
77553	77558	77559	77559	He	266	“ Okay , cool . ”

78633	78642	78643	78643	I	2959	“ You ’ll feel much better after it , ”
78646	78654	78655	78655	He	186	“ Massage , dinner , and bed . ”
78838	78841	78842	78842	I	2959	“ Jay , ”
78852	78859	78846	78846	He	186	“ Jay , bedtime , baby , ”

79393	79404	79390	79390	he	2829	“ It ’s okay . I ’m on the pill , ”
79489	79493	79494	79494	he	2829	“ Hold it , ”
79685	79690	79675	79675	he	2829	“ I ’m close , ”
79694	79698	79699	79699	he	2829	“ Hold it , ”
79705	79708	79699	79699	he	2829	“ Jameson . ”
79923	79926	79927	79927	I	2959	“ Jay , ”
79935	79941	79942	79942	he	2829	“ I know , baby , ”
80029	80034	80025	80025	I	2959	“ I feel like — ”
80035	80039	80040	80040	He	2829	“ Do n’t . ”
80045	80048	80049	80049	I	2959	“ What ? ”
80052	80058	80059	80059	I	2959	“ Do n’t ruin this . ”
80069	80076	80059	80059	I	2959	“ How would I ruin this ? ”
80077	80088	80096	80096	him	2829	“ Do n’t fall in love with me , Emily . ”
80098	80102	80093	80093	I	2959	“ Why not ? ”
80103	80120	80121	80121	He	2829	“ Because we ’re not like that . Get that through your head . Right now . ”
80200	80207	80208	80208	I	2959	“ For the record , Jameson , ”
80211	80229	80230	80230	He	2829	“ I was going to tell you that you should wake me up like that every day . ”
80237	80256	80257	80257	He	2829	“ It seems to me that the only person who ’s thinking about love around here is you . ”
80274	80294	80267	80267	His	2829	“ So do n’t turn this around and push me away because you are falling in love with me ! ”
80369	80374	80349	80352	Mr. Miles the CEO	79	“ Are you ready ? ”

80871	80879	80880	80880	I	2959	“ I ’m going out with Ava , ”
80890	80904	80905	80905	I	2959	“ I told you I did n’t want you going clubbing with her . ”
80915	80933	80905	80905	I	2959	“ What I do when I ’m not with you is none of your business , Jameson . ”
80934	80945	80946	80946	I	2959	“ So now you ’re going to be all dramatic ? ”
80951	80957	80946	80946	I	2959	“ Will you just stop . ”
80958	80962	80966	80966	his	266	“ Stop what ? ”
80968	81013	81014	81014	I	2959	“ I ’m not in love with you . So . . . you can stop worrying that I am . I enjoy your company , but you obviously have a hang - up about someone caring for you and mistake it for love . ”
81019	81032	81033	81033	His	266	“ It ’s all a bit too hard , to be honest . ”
81047	81053	81040	81040	he	266	“ What does that mean ? ”
81054	81057	81058	81058	I	2959	“ What ? ”
81061	81068	81058	81058	I	2959	“ That it ’s too hard . ”
81069	81085	81086	81086	I	2959	“ It means go and find someone else not to fall in love with you . ”
81089	81096	81086	81086	I	2959	“ I ’m fine with that . ”
81097	81104	81105	81105	he	266	“ You ’re fine with that ? ”
81109	81129	81130	81130	I	2959	“ So if I went and had sex with someone else tonight , you ’d be fine with that ? ”
81158	81173	81150	81150	I	2959	“ Jameson , for fuck ’s sake . What do you want from me ? ”
81174	81180	81181	81181	he	266	“ I do n’t know , ”
81184	81187	81188	81188	I	2959	“ Fine . ”
81195	81205	81188	81188	I	2959	“ Let ’s leave it at that , then . ”
81206	81212	81150	81150	I	2959	“ What does that mean ? ”
81213	81217	81218	81218	I	2959	“ My God , ”
81223	81250	81251	81251	He	266	“ For a smart man , you ’re being really stupid . I ca n’t help you work out what you want from me , Jameson . ”
81256	81292	81293	81293	He	266	“ One minute you ’re telling me not to ruin it by falling in love with you , and the next minute you ’re telling me you do n’t want me going out without you . ”
81302	81341	81293	81293	He	266	“ I want a close friend to have sex with . We talked about this . It seems to me that the only person breaking the rules here is you . Why are you even thinking about love ? ”
81342	81350	81351	81351	he	266	“ Do n’t turn this on me , ”
81355	81361	81362	81362	I	2959	“ All right , then , ”
81365	81384	81385	81385	He	266	“ Can you look me in the eye and tell me that you have no feelings for me ? ”
81392	81396	81385	81385	He	266	“ Can you ? ”
81397	81403	81404	81404	I	2959	“ Of course I can . ”
81412	81418	81404	81404	I	2959	“ Do it , then . ”
81419	81422	81385	81385	He	266	“ What ? ”
81423	81456	81457	81457	He	266	“ Tell me that you do n’t have feelings for me . Tell me you have never thought of me once over the last year and that you never kept my scarf . ”
81464	81469	81470	81470	I	2959	“ Like I thought , ”
81482	81499	81500	81500	he	266	“ I wondered how long it would be until that snarky bitch reared her ugly head , ”
81506	81509	81510	81510	I	2959	“ Ha , ”
81513	81523	81510	81510	I	2959	“ At least that bitch knows what she wants . ”
81524	81530	81531	81531	he	266	“ And what ’s that ? ”
81534	81553	81531	81531	he	266	“ A man ; that ’s what she wants — one who is n’t afraid of his feelings . ”
81554	81559	81560	81560	he	266	“ Go to hell , ”
81563	81591	81592	81592	I	2959	“ Just stop talking . You ’re stressing me the fuck out with all your shit . If I wanted a psychiatrist , I would date one . ”
81601	81618	81592	81592	I	2959	“ We ’re not dating , Jameson . We ’re just fucking . Get it right . ”
81619	81639	81645	81645	I	2959	“ You go out with Ava trolling for men tonight , and we wo n’t even be doing that . ”
81640	81644	81645	81645	I	2959	“ Excuse me ? ”
81654	81664	81645	81645	I	2959	“ You ca n’t tell me what to do . ”
81670	81679	81665	81665	His	2959	“ I can . And I just did . ”
81680	81683	81684	81684	I	2959	“ Jameson . ”
81698	81749	81684	81684	I	2959	“ I would never sleep with someone behind your back — you know that . But you ca n’t tell me where I ’m allowed to go . Even if you loved me , which you do n’t , I would n’t allow you to dictate what I can do . ”
81750	81755	81794	81794	he	369	“ I mean it . ”
81756	81761	81684	81684	I	2959	“ Go to hell . ”
81786	81793	81794	81794	he	369	“ I ’ll see you tonight , ”
81808	81824	81801	81801	I	2959	“ Yeah , wait for me . I ’ll be there when hell freezes over . ”
81865	81872	81873	81873	Molly	198	“ Wonder what this is about ? ”
81884	81890	81876	81876	she	198	“ What what ’s about ? ”
81897	81922	81891	81891	I	2959	“ It says here that Miles Media is having crisis meetings today with shareholders and that more meetings are scheduled in London next week . ”
81935	81938	81927	81927	Jameson	186	“ What ? ”
82239	82245	82246	82246	I	2959	“ Hello , Mr. Miles . ”
82256	82259	82251	82251	His	186	“ Hello . ”
82260	82268	82275	82275	he	186	“ Can I help you , sir ? ”
82269	82274	82275	82275	he	186	“ Where is Jake ? ”
82281	82291	82292	82292	I	2959	“ Jake would be flirting somewhere in the office , ”
82296	82311	82312	82312	I	2959	“ Look for a good - looking woman , and you will find him . ”
82365	82388	82389	82389	I	2959	“ Tristan , I was wondering if I can see you for a few moments at some point this afternoon , please ? ”
82392	82405	82389	82389	I	2959	“ Yes , of course . Come up in half an hour . ”
82452	82455	82441	82441	he	186	“ Bye . ”
82456	82459	82460	82460	he	186	“ Goodbye , ”
82542	82546	82547	82547	he	186	“ Come in , ”
82550	82553	82554	82554	I	2959	“ Hello . ”
82557	82562	82563	82563	He	186	“ Hi , Emily . ”
82569	82575	82576	82576	I	2959	“ Come take a seat . ”
82580	82600	82576	82576	I	2959	“ I just wanted to keep you updated on something that happened yesterday that felt out of the ordinary . ”
82601	82606	82607	82607	He	186	“ Great , okay . ”
82615	82620	82607	82607	He	186	“ What is it ? ”
82621	82632	82633	82633	He	186	“ Hayden came and asked me for my stories early . ”
82639	82663	82633	82633	He	186	“ It felt weird that he needed them early . So . . . I lied and said it was n’t ready yet . ”
82664	82667	82607	82607	He	186	“ And ? ”
82668	82677	82678	82678	He	186	“ And there was no fake news today . ”
82683	82718	82678	82678	He	186	“ I do n’t know if I ’m grasping at straws , but it kind of felt like the fake news stories only go to print if they are in by a certain time . ”
82719	82727	82728	82728	He	186	“ Interesting . That ’s great work . ”
82734	82762	82763	82763	I	2959	“ Hold the story back today so we can test the theory , and I will start to dig up some info on Hayden . Good work . ”
82766	82772	82773	82773	he	186	“ Is everything all right ? ”
82776	82781	82773	82773	he	186	“ Yes , why ? ”
82804	82808	82794	82794	Jameson	186	“ Just checking . ”
82809	82814	82794	82794	Jameson	186	“ Everything ’s great . ”
82815	82818	82794	82794	Jameson	186	“ Good . ”
82819	82824	82825	82825	I	2959	“ See you later . ”
83147	83150	83137	83137	I	2959	“ Hello . ”
83151	83154	83118	83118	he	186	“ Hey . ”
83160	83165	83118	83118	he	186	“ Who is it ? ”
83166	83171	83172	83172	he	186	“ It ’s me , ”
83175	83178	83172	83172	he	186	“ Jameson ? ”
83179	83185	83186	83186	he	186	“ You expecting someone else ? ”
83323	83332	83333	83333	He	186	“ Did you run all the way here ? ”
83346	83352	83336	83336	He	186	“ Are you all right ? ”
83365	83368	83369	83369	I	2959	“ Jay , ”
83424	83433	83434	83434	I	2959	“ Did the ax murderer chase you here ? ”
83448	83451	83441	83441	He	186	“ Maybe . ”
83452	83460	83434	83434	I	2959	“ I paid him to do that . ”
83461	83464	83465	83465	He	186	“ Witch . ”
83468	83480	83465	83465	He	186	“ Come on , let ’s get you in the shower . ”
83520	83529	83530	83530	he	186	“ I ’ve had the worst few days , ”
83544	83558	83533	83533	I	2959	“ I know , baby . This work nightmare will be over soon . ”
83559	83568	83585	83585	he	186	“ It has nothing to do with work . ”
83569	83578	83585	83585	he	186	“ What ’s it got to do with ? ”
83593	83596	83585	83585	he	186	“ You . ”
83610	83615	83616	83616	He	186	“ You missed me ? ”
83636	83647	83625	83625	I	2959	“ I missed you , too , you big dope . ”
83648	83653	83625	83625	I	2959	“ But you said — ”
83654	83676	83677	83677	He	186	“ Do n’t worry about what that snarky bitch said . She ’s off her chops . Pay her no attention . ”
83687	83702	83703	83703	I	2959	“ Off her chops ? What the hell does that even mean , Emily ? ”
83706	83719	83720	83720	He	186	“ When snarky bitches go crazy , they go off their chops . ”
83738	83752	83753	83753	I	2959	“ I do n’t know what ’s going on between us , Jay . ”
83766	83786	83756	83756	I	2959	“ But you can depend on me . Do n’t be scared of us . Because I ’m not . ”
83787	83792	83793	83793	he	186	“ You should be , ”
83797	83816	83793	83793	he	186	“ Why would I be scared of someone who makes me feel the way you make me feel ? ”
83831	83842	83822	83822	he	186	“ It ’s been a long few days without you . ”
83856	83874	83875	83875	His	186	“ Get in the shower , and wash away the last week , and stay with me . ”
84190	84196	84197	84197	I	2959	“ No layovers , okay ? ”
84206	84215	84216	84216	He	2829	“ No talking to girls who get upgraded . ”
84221	84227	84216	84216	He	2829	“ Stop talking , wench . ”
84233	84246	84247	84247	He	2829	“ Oh . I hate the thought of a week without you . ”
84255	84261	84262	84262	I	2959	“ Will you say something ? ”
84265	84277	84278	84278	His	2829	“ Say something sweet to put me out of my misery . ”
84289	84298	84299	84299	I	2959	“ I packed your scarf in my luggage . ”
84303	84327	84299	84299	I	2959	“ It ’s nothing new . I ’ve taken it on every trip I ’ve been on . . . since we met . ”
84355	84359	84360	84360	I	2959	“ You have ? ”

84645	84654	84655	84655	he	2829	“ What ’s going on today , sweetheart ? ”
84674	84677	84663	84663	he	2829	“ Working . ”

84807	84830	84799	84799	I	2959	“ It ’s hard to relax when I know how gorgeous you are on the other side of the world all alone . ”
84831	84843	84844	84844	I	2959	“ Well , in four more days you ’ll be back . ”
84850	84865	84844	84844	I	2959	“ I ’ve got to go . I ’m going to miss my bus . ”

85108	85122	85081	85081	she	198	“ I ’m on the interstate near the garage we get gas from . ”
85123	85132	85133	85133	She	198	“ Okay , I ’m on my way . ”
85165	85173	85174	85174	I	2959	“ Do you know mouth to mouth ? ”

85184	85198	85199	85199	I	2959	“ Maybe a little bit . Can you google passing out for me ? ”
85204	85212	85199	85199	I	2959	“ Should we just call an ambulance ? ”
85213	85216	85217	85217	She	198	“ Maybe . ”
85230	85233	85234	85234	he	2959	“ Hello , ”

85251	85258	85225	85225	she	198	“ Should I call an ambulance ? ”

85344	85348	85349	85349	He	2959	“ What happened ? ”
85356	85363	85349	85349	He	2959	“ Do not tell a soul . ”
85364	85367	85368	85368	He	2959	“ What ? ”
85387	85392	85393	85393	Molly	198	“ What the fuck ? ”
85396	85424	85425	85425	I	2959	“ I have a Tinder date tonight , so I took a Viagra , but it did n’t seem to work , so I took another two . ”
85440	85446	85447	85447	He	2959	“ You took three Viagra ? ”
85457	85469	85447	85447	He	2959	“ You are the stupidest fucking man I ’ve ever known . ”
85470	85475	85476	85476	He	2959	“ Without a doubt . ”
85498	85504	85505	85505	she	198	“ Get in the car , ”
85508	85517	85505	85505	she	198	“ I ’m taking you to the ER . ”
85518	85521	85522	85522	he	2959	“ What ? ”
85525	85528	85522	85522	he	2959	“ No . ”
85529	85543	85544	85544	she	198	“ You have no blood left in your body , you stupid fuck ! ”
85581	85590	85591	85591	he	2959	“ What ’s the ER going to do ? ”
85594	85617	85618	85618	He	2959	“ Other than laugh at the middle - aged man with a Tinder erection , nothing . Get in the damn car . ”
85708	85745	85700	85700	Molly	198	“ So . . . let me get this straight , Michael . You ’re going out with Madam Whorebag tonight , and you go to all this trouble to satisfy whoever she is in bed ? ”
85764	85781	85782	85782	she	198	“ You could n’t even be bothered to have sex with me at all , Michael ! ”
85785	85797	85782	85782	she	198	“ How the hell do you think that makes me feel ? ”
85798	85807	85808	85808	he	2959	“ Because you did n’t fucking like it , ”
85812	85820	85808	85808	he	2959	“ Because I got two fucking pumps . ”
85849	85863	85864	85864	he	2959	“ Why do you think I have to take this shit ? Huh ? ”
85867	85880	85864	85864	he	2959	“ Because I knew what a fucking disappointment I was to you . ”
85888	85904	85881	85881	Molly	198	“ You were never a disappointment . You were fucking lazy and did n’t care . ”
85905	85911	85912	85912	he	2959	“ I did so care ! ”
85915	85926	85912	85912	he	2959	“ Losing you is the biggest regret of my life . ”
85969	85977	85978	85978	I	2959	“ Eyes on the road , Moll , ”
85986	86003	85981	85981	She	198	“ So why did n’t you call her to come and get you tonight , huh ? ”
86004	86015	86016	86016	He	2959	“ Because I would n’t tell her anything about me . ”
86030	86034	86035	86035	she	198	“ Why not ? ”
86038	86045	86035	86035	she	198	“ Because she ’s not you ! ”
86100	86110	86093	86093	Molly	198	“ My husband needs to see somebody , please . ”
86111	86117	86118	86119	the nurse	1308	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
86136	86145	86122	86122	She	1308	“ I accidentally gave him too much Viagra . ”
86173	86176	86162	86162	She	1308	“ Oh . ”
86252	86274	86275	86275	Buzz	178	“ This projection here is based on the current climate . However , that may change when the election goes through . ”
86338	86365	86329	86329	her	1308	“ I have to take this call . Elliot , can you go through the advertising strategy for next month , please , while I do ? ”
86366	86370	86371	86371	Elliot	140	“ Sure thing . ”
86395	86398	86329	86329	her	1308	“ Hello . ”
86399	86402	86403	86403	Emily	186	“ Hi . ”
86413	86416	86403	86403	Emily	186	“ Hi . ”
86431	86437	86438	86438	she	186	“ Did I interrupt anything ? ”
86452	86459	86441	86441	I	2959	“ No , not at all . ”
86460	86471	86472	86472	I	2959	“ I called to tell you I bought new sneakers . ”
86475	86479	86472	86472	I	2959	“ You did ? ”
86480	86511	86512	86512	God	0	“ Uh - huh , they ’re motorized , so I will be whipping your ass on park runs from here on in . Just thought I should warn you . ”
86537	86543	86524	86525	a woman	339	“ I highly doubt that . ”
86544	86557	86558	86558	she	186	“ Oh hell , you wo n’t believe what happened last night , ”
86561	86608	86609	86609	I	2959	“ Molly ’s ex - husband took two Viagra , maybe three , and passed out while he was driving because he had no blood left in his body because it was all in his dick , so we had to take him to the ER . ”
86614	86624	86609	86609	I	2959	“ What the hell ? Is that a thing ? ”
86625	86636	86637	86637	I	2959	“ Yes , it ’s a thing . Who knew ? ”
86644	86655	86656	86656	I	2959	“ I ’ll have to stop taking it , then , ”
86662	86703	86659	86659	She	186	“ No , it ’s okay . I completely know what to do now . Passing out is well worth it . You stay on that shit — we just need to tourniquet it . I ’ve got us covered . ”
86712	86716	86717	86717	I	2959	“ Three days , ”
86720	86724	86725	86725	she	186	“ Three days , ”
86743	86750	86751	86751	I	2959	“ What are you doing now ? ”
86754	86789	86751	86751	I	2959	“ I ’m about to put a face mask on and take a bath with cut - up cucumber over my eyes . You ’re missing out on a real visual sensation over here . ”
86790	86794	86795	86795	I	2959	“ No doubt . ”
86833	86845	86846	86846	I	2959	“ So you ’ve added cucumbers to your beauty regimen now ? ”
86849	86861	86862	86862	I	2959	“ Yeah , it ’s supposed to make you less puffy . ”
86866	86888	86889	86889	She	186	“ Cucumbers are good for a lot of things . Maybe it should be added to our sexual regimen as well . ”
86894	86903	86889	86889	She	186	“ You ’re a sicko , Mr. Miles . ”
86904	86911	86889	86889	She	186	“ So you keep telling me . ”
86912	86919	86920	86920	I	2959	“ I ’ll let you go . ”
86929	86934	86920	86920	I	2959	“ Goodbye , Emily . ”
86935	86940	86941	86941	she	186	“ Goodbye , Jay , ”
86983	86992	86977	86977	He	140	“ You have Zuckerberg on speed dial now ? ”
86993	86996	86997	86997	I	2959	“ Huh ? ”
87000	87012	87013	87013	I	2959	“ FB . . . that stands for Facebook , right ? ”
87054	87060	87061	87061	Elliot	140	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
87064	87070	87071	87071	Elliot	140	“ Zuckerberg bought motorized sneakers . ”
87076	87089	87071	87071	Elliot	140	“ It would n’t surprise me . That guy ’s fucking crazy . ”
87214	87221	87222	87222	she	57	“ Thank God you ’re here , ”
87228	87234	87222	87222	she	57	“ I ’ve missed you . ”
87237	87240	87244	87244	she	57	“ Hello . ”
87263	87268	87269	87269	I	2959	“ How are you ? ”
87272	87280	87281	87281	She	57	“ Good now that you ’re here . ”
87342	87349	87334	87334	Her	57	“ Any news on the sabotage ? ”
87350	87356	87357	87357	She	57	“ No , none yet . ”
87371	87383	87357	87357	She	57	“ You have something on your mind . What is it ? ”
87384	87390	87396	87396	She	57	“ I ’ve met someone . ”
87391	87395	87396	87396	She	57	“ Do n’t . ”
87413	87420	87396	87396	She	57	“ I could n’t help it . ”
87446	87463	87439	87439	I	2959	“ Do n’t tell me you could n’t help it when we both know you can . ”
87464	87472	87439	87439	I	2959	“ The pull to her is strong . ”
87473	87477	87478	87478	she	57	“ Physical pull ? ”
87500	87513	87514	87514	Her	57	“ At first , yes . I thought it was just physical . ”
87520	87529	87514	87514	Her	57	“ How long ago did you meet her ? ”
87530	87534	87535	87535	Her	57	“ Twelve months . ”
87542	87552	87535	87535	Her	57	“ You ’ve been seeing someone for twelve months ? ”
87553	87556	87557	87557	I	2959	“ No , ”
87560	87589	87557	87557	I	2959	“ I met her on a flight a year ago , we spent a night together on a layover , and I ’ve recently run into her again . ”
87590	87612	87613	87613	she	57	“ Big deal , Jameson . You ’ve slept with a lot of women while we ’ve been on this break , ”
87618	87626	87627	87627	I	2959	“ This one ’s different , Claudia , ”
87646	87651	87631	87631	She	57	“ I ’ve thought of her”—I
87658	87674	87675	87675	My	2959	share—“a lot since we met , and then it was as if I . . . ”
87693	87699	87700	87700	she	57	“ As if you what ? ”
87704	87717	87718	87718	She	57	“ It was as if I willed her back into my life . ”
87722	87726	87718	87718	She	57	“ Meaning what ? ”
87727	87748	87749	87749	She	57	“ She ’d been on my mind a lot . . . and then she showed up in my office . ”
87756	87766	87749	87749	She	57	“ Of course she would — you’re Jameson Miles . ”
87767	87786	87718	87718	She	57	“ She had no idea who I was when we met . I gave her a fake name . ”
87787	87796	87797	87797	she	57	“ So why are you here , Jameson ? ”
87810	87820	87800	87800	I	2959	“ I ’m here to end it with you . ”
87821	87826	87827	87827	She	57	“ Do n’t you . ”
87832	87849	87850	87850	Her	57	“ Do n’t you dare throw away everything we ’ve worked so hard to keep together . ”
87856	87859	87860	87860	I	2959	“ Claud . ”
87864	87910	87860	87860	I	2959	“ We ’re no good together . We ’re both workaholics , we live on other sides of the world , and unless one of us loses our job , that ’s never going to change . I ca n’t be anywhere but New York . ”
87911	87918	87919	87919	she	57	“ What if I moved back ? ”
87922	87930	87931	87931	I	2959	“ And give up your dream job ? ”
87934	87956	87957	87957	She	57	“ I would n’t let you do that for me . I know how hard you ’ve worked for this job . ”
87970	87987	87963	87963	I	2959	“ You need to fall in love with someone who can support you in your role . ”
87988	87992	87993	87993	she	57	“ I have , ”
88011	88037	88001	88001	I	2959	“ Two people who are wired the same way ca n’t be in a forever relationship . We need to be with opposites , Claud . ”
88045	88068	88069	88069	She	57	“ Two workaholics will never work . We ’re both too focused and too stressed out to properly look after one another . ”
88093	88103	88104	88104	she	57	“ What happened to our five - year plan ? ”
88107	88143	88104	88104	she	57	“ It was good in theory , but come on . We both knew when we made the break that there was a big chance we would n’t make it through to the other side . ”
88144	88150	88151	88151	she	57	“ I ’ll move back , ”
88171	88191	88192	88192	Her	57	“ It ’s too late . I have feelings for Emily . It ’s her that I want now . ”
88199	88205	88206	88206	she	57	“ Emily , is it ? ”
88218	88228	88209	88209	I	2959	“ Who is she ? What does she do ? ”
88229	88240	88241	88241	She	57	“ She ’s just a normal girl from the suburbs . ”
88248	88284	88241	88241	She	57	“ You . . . with a normal girl ? Ha , what a joke . I suppose she cooks and cleans and fusses over you and sucks your dick on command , does she ? ”
88293	88300	88285	88285	I	2959	“ She ’s good for me . ”
88301	88308	88309	88309	she	57	“ I ’m good for you , ”
88313	88333	88334	88334	Her	57	“ As a work colleague or employee , yes — as a mate . . . not so much . ”
88341	88349	88350	88350	I	2959	“ I ’m not good for you . ”
88353	88433	88434	88434	I	2959	“ I ’m so busy that I ca n’t be there for you either . You deserve to be doted on , but I ca n’t do that from New York , Claud ; you know I ca n’t . There is no way around this situation . Our lives are traveling on different paths . Two CEOs ca n’t hold their careers and nurture a relationship from different sides of the world . It ’s an impossible task . ”
88446	88471	88437	88437	I	2959	“ Until I met her . . . I did n’t realize what we were both missing out on . Both me and you . ”
88477	88522	88523	88523	She	1326	“ I wish it were you telling me you ’d met someone , so then I would n’t be saying this . I love you , and you ’re the last person I want to hurt . I would much rather you hurt me . ”
88545	88550	88551	88551	she	1326	“ So what now ? ”

94788	94800	94773	94773	He	186	“ Since when ? We have n’t discussed this at all . ”
94801	94807	94808	94808	He	186	“ Yes , we have . ”

94860	94883	94884	94884	He	186	“ Jameson , doing this is in my mind holding hands in public and dating . Maybe meeting each other ’s families . ”
94891	94929	94930	94930	He	186	“ What ’s with the sudden change ? Last week you got angry with me for falling in love with you . I could n’t even look at you after sex without you getting upset with me . ”
94938	94955	94930	94930	He	186	“ You said you did n’t love me . Are you saying that now you do ? ”
94956	94969	94930	94930	He	186	“ That ’s not the point . You know what I mean . ”
94970	94981	94982	94982	He	186	“ I want us to make a go of it . ”

95003	95037	95038	95038	He	186	“ I ’m not a business transaction , Jameson . You do n’t move forward with your plans without talking to me first . They are n’t just your plans , you know . ”
95051	95076	95038	95038	He	186	“ There are two people in this relationship , Jay , and me loving you does not mean you get to take me over . ”
95077	95082	95083	95083	he	186	“ I know that , ”
95086	95101	95038	95038	He	186	“ So you do love me now ? Make up your mind , woman . ”
95102	95118	95038	95038	He	186	“ Stop changing the subject . Do you understand what I ’m saying to you ? ”

95138	95154	95155	95155	I	2959	“ I just do n’t know why you ’ve had this sudden change of heart . ”
95158	95163	95155	95155	I	2959	“ It ’s peculiar . ”
95164	95177	95185	95185	I	2959	“ My heart has n’t changed at all . My situation has . ”
95178	95184	95185	95185	I	2959	“ What does that mean ? ”
95192	95201	95188	95188	He	186	“ I went and saw Claudia in London . ”
95222	95227	95216	95216	I	2959	“ Who ’s Claudia ? ”
95228	95232	95233	95233	I	2959	“ My ex . ”
95251	95259	95260	95260	My	2959	“ I broke it off with her . ”
95266	95271	95272	95272	I	2959	“ What the hell ? ”
95275	95282	95272	95272	I	2959	“ You were still with her ? ”
95283	95301	95302	95302	I	2959	“ No , but we had promised each other that we would n’t date anyone else seriously . ”
95318	95321	95302	95302	I	2959	“ Why ? ”
95322	95335	95336	95336	I	2959	“ Because we planned on getting back together in a few years . ”
95387	95398	95417	95417	He	1396	“ I told her I have strong feelings for you . ”
95399	95403	95404	95404	I	2959	“ You did ? ”
95429	95433	95417	95417	He	1396	“ I did . ”
95434	95441	95442	95442	I	2959	“ What else did you say ? ”
95460	95468	95446	95446	I	2959	“ That it was over between us . ”
95469	95475	95417	95417	He	1396	“ Did you love her ? ”
95476	95479	95480	95480	He	1396	“ Yes . ”
95491	95518	95480	95480	He	1396	“ In my own way , I did . In hindsight , I realize that our relationship was never normal . Not like ours is anyway . ”
95563	95571	95572	95572	I	2959	“ You think our relationship is normal ? ”
95585	95590	95575	95575	He	1396	“ Do n’t you ? ”
95591	95605	95606	95606	I	2959	“ No . To me our relationship is exciting and wonderful and exotic . ”
95611	95620	95606	95606	I	2959	“ Normal gets boring very quick , Jameson . ”
95621	95635	95575	95575	He	1396	“ I told her that I want to build a future with you . ”
95655	95689	95644	95644	I	2959	“ I also told her that I ’ve had feelings for you since the day we met and that you are the only woman I want to be with from here on in . ”
95701	95711	95712	95712	I	2959	“ Did you tell her I had motorized sneakers ? ”
95734	95738	95726	95726	he	1396	“ I did . ”
95739	95747	95726	95726	he	1396	“ What does this mean , Jay ? ”
95753	95757	95726	95726	he	1396	“ For us . ”
95758	95767	95768	95768	He	1396	“ It means that I ’m all yours . ”
95771	95777	95768	95768	He	1396	“ If you want me . ”
95791	95804	95783	95783	I	2959	“ Have you been holding yourself back from me all this time ? ”
95805	95818	95726	95726	he	1396	“ I have , and I ca n’t do it any longer . ”
95819	95830	95783	95783	I	2959	“ What does this mean . . . for us ? ”
95831	95850	95783	95783	I	2959	“ It means I want you to move in , and we go full steam ahead from here . ”
95851	95857	95858	95858	I	2959	“ What ’s the rush ? ”
95861	95869	95870	95870	He	1396	“ Ca n’t we ease into it ? ”
95885	95896	95878	95878	his	1396	“ I do n’t do things in halves , Emily . ”
95897	95900	95901	95901	I	2959	“ Meaning ? ”
95904	95913	95901	95901	I	2959	“ Meaning that my woman is my world . ”
95925	95937	95938	95938	My	2959	“ I work hard . . . but I love harder . ”
95950	95961	95962	95962	He	1396	“ I ’m in love with you , Emily Foster . ”
95989	96056	96060	96060	him	1399	“ I ca n’t help it . I tried to stop it , and I could n’t . I think I ’ve loved you since our first night together in Boston . You stayed with me . I fought it , and still , I could n’t forget you . I ’ve been carrying your scarf around like a lovesick fool for more than a year . ”
96062	96125	96057	96057	I	2959	“ So please forgive me if I want to go full steam ahead . This is not a snap decision . It ’s been coming for a long time , and now that I ’m in a position to act on it , I do n’t want to waste any more time . I want you with me . By my side . ”
96153	96218	96145	96145	He	1399	“ Now I ’m going to eat his beautiful dinner that you ’ve made for me , and then I ’m going to take you to bed and make you forget everything that I said to you about not falling for me , and then , hopefully , you can show me that you have some kind of resemblance of feelings for me too . ”
96226	96229	96230	96230	he	1399	“ Okay ? ”
96240	96243	96233	96233	he	1399	“ Okay . ”
96467	96470	96471	96471	I	2959	“ Hey , ”
96480	96485	96486	96486	He	186	“ Hello , sweetheart . ”

97575	97581	97582	97582	She	1418	“ Would n’t surprise me . ”
97590	97597	97598	97598	I	2959	“ Why do you say that ? ”
97601	97609	97598	97598	I	2959	“ He was fired from the Gazette . ”
97610	97614	97615	97615	Aaron	0	“ What for ? ”
97618	97644	97615	97615	Aaron	0	“ I do n’t know for certain , but the word on the street was that he was involved in a phone - tap scandal . ”
97645	97648	97598	97598	I	2959	“ What ? ”
97649	97652	97653	97653	She	1418	“ Apparently . ”
97658	97681	97653	97653	She	1418	“ And this is complete speculation , but he was caught tapping one of his coworkers ’ phones and stealing her leads . ”
97686	97691	97653	97653	She	1418	“ Really ? Who ? ”
97692	97699	97709	97709	Aaron	0	“ A girl named Keeley May . ”
97700	97707	97709	97709	Aaron	0	“ Oh yes , the redhead , ”
97711	97717	97718	97718	Molly	198	“ She ’s fucking hot . ”
97727	97737	97738	97738	Molly	198	“ Since when do you think girls are hot ? ”
97741	97757	97758	97758	he	0	“ I ’m gay , not blind . I can appreciate a fine female form , ”
97767	97778	97779	97779	Molly	198	“ Why do you think he ’s up to something ? ”
97811	97834	97835	97835	I	2959	“ I told him one of my stories the other day , and I saw that he submitted it as his own , ”
97843	97847	97838	97838	Molly	198	“ Fucking snake . ”
97848	97857	97858	97858	I	2959	“ I have no proof , of course , ”
97861	97874	97858	97858	I	2959	“ I was just wondering about his character , that ’s all . ”
97875	97883	97884	97884	she	198	“ From what I know of him , ”
97888	97902	97884	97884	she	198	“ I would n’t trust him as far as I could throw him . ”

97930	97941	97942	97942	Molly	198	“ He ’s just an asshole , that ’s all . ”
97949	98006	98007	98007	He	0	“ You know what , Aaron , stop playing the fucking victim here . You know he ’s sleeping around , and you ’re still sleeping with him . It ’s one thing to be deceived , but to willingly go back for more when you know exactly what is going on is just plain pathetic . ”
98012	98025	98007	98007	He	0	“ You do n’t have to be such a bitch about it . ”
98026	98078	98079	98079	she	1422	“ Yeah , I do . You ’re acting like a damsel in distress . You do n’t have kids with him . You do n’t have a mortgage . You do n’t work with him . The break would be easy . Tell him to fuck off and move on , ”
98082	98094	98079	98079	she	1422	“ Breakups are hard . Staying with an asshole is harder . ”
98095	98110	98111	98111	I	2959	“ Speaking of moving on — Jameson asked me to move in with him , ”
98130	98135	98118	98118	Aaron	0	“ What the hell ? ”
98136	98139	98140	98140	I	2959	“ Apparently . ”
98146	98153	98143	98143	Aaron	0	“ What ’s with the turnabout ? ”
98154	98170	98178	98178	Aaron	0	“ He went and saw Claudia , his ex , while he was in London . ”
98171	98177	98178	98178	Aaron	0	“ Did he fuck her ? ”
98186	98199	98200	98200	Molly	198	“ No , Aaron , fucking other people is n’t normal behavior , ”
98203	98219	98200	98200	Molly	198	“ Get that through your thick head . Your view on reality is seriously distorted . ”
98220	98234	98235	98235	Aaron	0	“ Fuck , you ’re a real bitch today , you know that ? ”
98238	98253	98254	98254	she	198	“ Well , that communal dick of your boyfriend ’s is pissing me off , ”
98270	98299	98264	98264	Molly	198	“ He said that he and Claudia had planned on getting back together , but he told her he wanted a future with me . He ended it . ”
98300	98304	98305	98305	Aaron	0	“ Holy shit , ”
98308	98316	98305	98305	Aaron	0	“ He told me he loves me . ”
98317	98322	98323	98323	Molly	198	“ What the fuck ? ”
98326	98331	98323	98323	Molly	198	“ Are you serious ? ”
98332	98337	98338	98338	I	2959	“ But . . . ”
98341	98345	98346	98346	Aaron	0	“ But what ? ”
98349	98360	98346	98346	Aaron	0	“ There should be no buts anywhere in this story . ”
98361	98376	98377	98377	I	2959	“ It ’s all so fast . What ’s the rush , you know ? ”
98380	98389	98390	98390	They	1424	“ I ’m scared he ’s just stressed . ”
98396	98420	98390	98390	They	1424	“ He told me that he ’s had feelings since we first met , and it ’s been coming for a long time . ”
98421	98427	98428	98428	Molly	198	“ That could be true . ”
98431	98436	98437	98437	I	2959	“ It could be . ”
98442	98452	98437	98437	I	2959	“ It could also be in his takeover strategy . ”
98453	98458	98459	98459	Molly	198	“ What takeover strategy ? ”
98462	98470	98471	98471	I	2959	“ Jameson Miles gets what he wants , ”
98474	98483	98471	98471	I	2959	“ If he ’s decided he wants me — ”
98484	98489	98490	98490	Aaron	0	“ Which he has , ”
98493	98505	98506	98506	I	2959	“ He will make it happen . I do n’t know . ”
98509	98548	98549	98549	Molly	198	“ It just all seems too good to be true , and the whole Claudia situation has freaked me out a little . Can I really believe that Claudia and he will just break off all communication now ? ”
98554	98569	98570	98570	She	198	“ Here we go . Have you two idiots been sniffing ink cartridges today ? ”
98578	98614	98615	98615	She	198	“ Stop being a fucking negative bitch . If he did n’t tell you he loved you , that would have been a problem . Now that he has , he has an ulterior motive . ”
98623	98632	98633	98633	She	198	“ Will you two come back to Earth ? ”
98637	98644	98645	98645	She	198	“ We have to get back . ”
98659	98667	98668	98668	Aaron	0	“ She needs a good deep dicking , ”
98671	98679	98668	98668	Aaron	0	“ She ’s in full bitch mode . ”
98691	98697	98680	98680	I	2959	“ You could be right . ”
98850	98860	98861	98861	Jameson	186	“ Are you nearly ready , my fuck bunny ? ”
98888	98895	98896	98896	I	2959	“ Jesus , you look beautiful . ”
98905	98910	98896	98896	I	2959	“ Is this okay ? ”
98911	98914	98915	98915	He	186	“ Perfect . ”
98926	98937	98915	98915	He	186	“ I do n’t like those red lips , though . ”
98938	98941	98942	98942	My	2959	“ Oh . ”
98946	98957	98958	98958	I	2959	“ I ca n’t kiss you without wearing the evidence . ”

99194	99205	99173	99173	he	186	“ Do n’t let me drink too much , okay ? ”
99206	99209	99210	99210	He	186	“ Okay . ”
99219	99235	99236	99236	He	186	“ And if you see me drinking too much , take my glass from me . ”
99239	99257	99258	99258	He	186	“ Honestly , Jay , I go from a level four to a ten in two mouthfuls . ”
99278	99288	99289	99289	I	2959	“ Not a truer word has ever been spoken . ”
99298	99308	99289	99289	I	2959	“ I ’m not talking about head , Jameson . ”

101659	101664	101665	101665	I	2959	“ And the crankiest . ”
101687	101698	101668	101668	she	200	“ Lauren , look who ’s here ! Emily Foster . ”
101699	101704	101705	101705	Lauren	201	“ Oh my God . ”
101731	101738	101739	101739	She	201	“ What are you doing here ? ”
101743	101758	101739	101739	She	201	“ I ’ve moved to New York now . I work for Miles Media . ”
101759	101762	101763	101763	I	2959	“ Really ? ”
101766	101769	101763	101763	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
101770	101781	101739	101739	She	201	“ Oh my God , we have to catch up . ”
101782	101785	101763	101763	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
101803	101813	101797	101797	I	2959	“ Make sure we get each other ’s numbers . ”
101824	101834	101835	101835	Someone	202	“ I ’m just going to get another champagne . ”
101864	101867	101868	101868	He	1502	“ Hello . ”
101875	101878	101868	101868	He	1502	“ Hi . ”
101879	101884	101885	101885	he	1502	“ Who are you ? ”
101906	101909	101900	101900	Jameson	186	“ Emily , ”
101926	101933	101914	101914	He	1502	“ My name is Gabriel Ferrara . ”
101934	101937	101914	101914	He	1502	“ Oh . ”
101938	101952	101953	101953	My	2959	“ And I like to take over all things owned by Jameson Miles . ”
101965	101969	101957	101957	His	1502	“ Women included . ”
101972	101976	101977	101977	I	2959	“ Excuse me ? ”
101988	101994	101995	101995	He	1502	“ What did you say ? ”
101999	102014	101995	101995	He	1502	“ I was merely stating that you are gorgeous . Do n’t be alarmed . ”
102015	102021	102022	102022	I	2959	“ Well , do n’t , ”
102039	102044	102028	102028	he	1502	“ Who are you ? ”
102045	102063	102064	102064	I	2959	“ Someone whose intelligence is insulted by your audacity . Goodbye , Mr. Ferrara . Go away . ”
102087	102107	102108	102108	His	1502	“ Lovely to meet you , Emily . We will meet again . I ’ll make sure of it . ”
102123	102128	102129	102129	I	2959	“ Do n’t bother , ”
102375	102383	102362	102362	he	186	“ Do you like these people here ? ”
102392	102401	102387	102387	His	186	“ I like the people at this table . ”
102407	102412	102413	102413	he	186	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
102422	102425	102426	102426	I	2959	“ Nothing , ”
102440	102451	102429	102429	I	2959	“ I do n’t particularly like any of these people . ”
102452	102470	102471	102471	he	186	“ Me neither , and as long as you like me , that ’s all that matters , ”
102490	102497	102498	102498	He	186	“ I more than like you . ”
102505	102514	102515	102515	he	186	“ Two hours , and we can go , ”
102518	102521	102515	102515	he	186	“ Good . ”

103188	103201	103184	103185	the MC	2959	“ The Diamond Award for exceptional media coverage goes to . . . ”
103219	103236	103206	103206	He	2959	“ Well , well . . . it seems we have a changing of the guard . ”
103242	103246	103247	103248	The crowd	265	“ Ferrara Media . ”
103268	103271	103272	103272	Tristan	2430	“ Fuck , ”
103320	103324	103315	103315	he	2430	“ Thank you . ”
103331	103354	103355	103355	He	2430	“ It means a lot . Commiserations to Miles Media , who have won this award consecutively for the last sixteen years . ”
103390	103397	103375	103375	His	186	“ I think it is safe to say”—Gabriel
103399	103418	103419	103419	He	186	sarcastically—“that in the last twelve months we have led the market with our cutting - edge news delivery . ”
103425	103438	103419	103419	He	186	“ We are now the number one media empire in the world . ”
103459	103467	103468	103468	I	2959	“ You ’ve got to be joking , ”
103901	103909	103910	103910	he	186	“ You ’re especially slow this morning , ”
103913	103926	103927	103927	He	186	“ You ’re especially fast today . That ax must be big . ”
103937	103941	103930	103930	he	186	“ Fucking huge . ”
103952	103965	103966	103966	he	186	“ I ’ll organize Alan for the weekend to get your things ? ”
103972	103978	103966	103966	he	186	“ About that . . . ”
103979	103982	103983	103983	he	186	“ Yes ? ”
103992	104000	104001	104001	He	186	“ I have a proposal for you . ”
104005	104009	104001	104001	He	186	“ Such as ? ”
104019	104030	104010	104010	I	2959	“ I ’ll move in with you on one condition . ”
104031	104034	104035	104035	He	186	“ What ? ”
104047	104066	104035	104035	He	186	“ I ’ll move in with you if we can get out of New York on the weekends . ”
104067	104070	104010	104010	I	2959	“ What ? ”
104071	104078	104079	104079	I	2959	“ Well , not every weekend . ”
104082	104090	104079	104079	I	2959	“ But enough that we can relax . ”
104091	104110	104111	104111	I	2959	“ New York is my home . I am relaxed . What are you talking about , woman ? ”
104124	104127	104118	104118	He	186	“ What ? ”
104128	104175	104176	104176	He	186	“ It ’s impossible to relax here , Jay . This city is hectic . The energy of this place could be seen from space . Sirens sound all night , cars and traffic and millions of people all buzzing at a million miles an hour . ”
104183	104209	104176	104176	He	186	“ We do n’t have to go far out of the city . I ’ve already booked a surprise trip away for us this weekend . ”
104210	104214	104118	104118	He	186	“ Since when ? ”
104215	104219	104220	104220	I	2959	“ Since yesterday . ”
104232	104268	104220	104220	I	2959	“ Think about it . We live in your apartment through the week and work hard . Then on the weekends , we completely switch off . No phones , no internet . Just us . ”
104269	104272	104273	104273	He	186	“ What ? ”
104276	104292	104273	104273	He	186	“ That ’s impossible . I need to be online at all times , Emily . ”
104293	104296	104297	104297	I	2959	“ No , ”
104303	104339	104297	104297	I	2959	“ What you need is to recharge so that you can be the best CEO you can be . A tired , stressed - out version of you wo n’t be half as switched on . ”
104360	104364	104365	104365	I	2959	“ And besides , ”
104368	104379	104365	104365	I	2959	“ this way I get the best of both worlds . ”
104380	104386	104365	104365	I	2959	“ What do you mean ? ”
104387	104407	104408	104408	He	2959	“ Well , I ’m utterly in love with my Jim , the man I met on the plane . ”
104411	104430	104431	104431	Jameson	186	“ And I ’m learning to love the stressed - out CEO who takes over his body sometimes . ”
104443	104449	104450	104450	I	2959	“ This way . . . ”
104465	104479	104480	104480	He	186	“ This way I get to spend time with both of my men . ”
104556	104563	104564	104564	I	2959	“ Do we have a deal ? ”
104567	104573	104574	104574	He	186	“ Am I moving in ? ”
104582	104595	104574	104574	He	186	“ I guess we can come to some kind of weekend arrangement . ”
104599	104611	104612	104612	He	186	“ Only because both of your men love to fuck you . ”
104635	104644	104628	104628	he	186	“ You ’re a sex maniac , Miles , ”
104661	104666	104667	104668	a man	2300	“ Get a room , ”
104691	104694	104695	104695	He	2300	“ What ? ”
104698	104701	104702	104702	I	2959	“ Nothing . ”
104707	104712	104713	104713	I	2959	“ Race you home . ”
104717	104727	104728	104728	He	2300	“ I could beat you with my legs tied . ”
104733	104748	104728	104728	He	2300	“ In fact , if I beat you , I am tying you up . ”
104749	104758	104759	104759	I	2959	“ Not if I tie you up first , ”
104795	104799	104800	104800	his	2300	“ Come in , ”
104818	104824	104825	104825	He	2300	“ Come in , Em . ”
104886	104897	104898	104898	I	2959	“ You were a hit with our parents last night . ”
104901	104904	104898	104898	I	2959	“ Really ? ”
104905	104915	104916	104916	He	108	“ My mother was gushing about you this morning . ”
104932	104945	104946	104946	He	108	“ I just wanted to keep you updated on a few things . ”
104949	104952	104946	104946	He	108	“ Okay . ”
104953	104977	104898	104898	I	2959	“ I ’m going to keep my relationship with Jameson completely unrelated to work . I feel he needs a break from it . ”
104978	104985	104946	104946	He	108	“ I agree . He does . ”
104986	105004	104946	104946	He	108	“ So , therefore , there are a few things that I wanted to discuss with you . ”
105005	105011	104898	104898	I	2959	“ Great . Fire away . ”
105012	105025	104946	104946	He	108	“ Well , you know how we ’ve been suspicious of Hayden ? ”
105026	105029	105030	105030	He	108	“ Yes . ”
105033	105060	105061	105061	He	108	“ I found out from Molly — and this is just rumors — that Hayden was fired from the Gazette for a phone - tapping scandal . ”
105068	105072	105061	105061	He	108	“ Like what ? ”
105073	105111	105116	105116	he	108	“ Apparently — and honestly , I have no idea if this is true , but Molly said it was what circulated at the time — he was tapping Keely May ’s phone and stealing her stories . ”
105112	105115	105116	105116	he	108	“ What ? ”
105119	105126	105116	105116	he	108	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? ”
105127	105130	105131	105131	He	108	“ No . ”
105135	105146	105131	105131	He	108	“ This is excellent . This gives me enough ammunition . ”
105147	105152	105170	105170	I	2959	“ To do what ? ”
105153	105169	105170	105170	I	2959	“ To get a search on his computers . We have n’t tapped him yet . ”
105174	105181	105170	105170	I	2959	“ Hopefully this will help us . ”
105182	105188	105189	105189	He	108	“ Good work , Em . ”
105206	105213	105214	105214	His	108	“ There was also something else . ”
105218	105238	105239	105239	His	108	“ I have n’t said anything to Jameson , but Gabriel Ferrara made a pass at me last night . ”
105243	105248	105249	105249	he	108	“ He did what ? ”
105252	105258	105259	105259	I	2959	“ Do n’t get excited , ”
105262	105268	105269	105269	I	2959	“ What did he say ? ”
105276	105304	105305	105305	Tristan	2430	“ I was at the bar , and he asked me who I was . I thought he was just being nice , and I replied Emily . ”
105311	105348	105308	105308	he	108	“ Then he picked up my hand and kissed the back of it and said , ‘ My name is Gabriel Ferrara , and I like to take over all things owned by Jameson Miles . ’ ”
105354	105364	105349	105349	Tristan	2430	“ Then he said , ‘ Women included . ’ ”
105365	105370	105371	105371	Tristan	2430	“ What the fuck ? ”
105374	105380	105381	105381	He	108	“ Are you fucking serious ? ”
105387	105405	105406	105406	I	2959	“ But I do n’t know if I read it the wrong way or . . . , ”
105409	105434	105435	105435	Tristan	2430	“ I do n’t want to be making more of this than it is , but I felt that it was really quite off . ”
105442	105448	105435	105435	Tristan	2430	“ What did you say ? ”
105449	105463	105464	105464	I	2959	“ I told him he was insulting my intelligence and to go away . ”
105471	105478	105464	105464	I	2959	“ He makes my skin crawl . ”
105479	105483	105484	105484	Tristan	2430	“ Fucking hell . ”
105507	105529	105530	105530	Tristan	2430	“ I did n’t say anything to Jameson because I feel like that ’s exactly what Gabriel wanted me to do . ”
105537	105545	105530	105530	Tristan	2430	“ He wants to start a war . ”
105546	105563	105564	105564	I	2959	“ That ’s what it felt like . . . there could be no other explanation , ”
105567	105582	105564	105564	I	2959	“ He ’s trying to rattle him by attacking him on a personal basis . ”
105583	105586	105587	105587	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
105597	105611	105612	105612	Tristan	2430	“ I worried about whether I should say anything to you all night . ”
105619	105625	105612	105612	Tristan	2430	“ Do n’t tell Jameson . ”
105626	105629	105612	105612	Tristan	2430	“ Okay . ”
105630	105638	105639	105639	I	2959	“ Let ’s keep this between us . ”
105643	105650	105651	105651	he	2959	“ I ’m concerned about Jameson , ”
105654	105662	105651	105651	he	2959	“ He ’s about to fucking crack . ”
105663	105698	105612	105612	Tristan	2430	“ I know ; I ’m going to try to get him out of the city for the weekends and get him offline . I ’m doing all I can to keep him calm . ”
105699	105703	105704	105704	He	2959	“ Good idea . ”
105712	105732	105733	105733	I	2959	“ If you had told him about Gabriel , he would be over there strangling the fucker right now . ”
105741	105745	105733	105733	I	2959	“ I know . ”
105746	105753	105754	105754	He	2959	“ You did the right thing . ”
105757	105764	105754	105754	He	2959	“ Thank you for telling me . ”
105770	105797	105754	105754	He	2959	“ I hate not telling Jameson , but I feel like I need to protect him from this . Gabriel is just trying to rattle him . ”
105798	105803	105804	105804	he	2959	“ My thoughts exactly , ”
105807	105851	105804	105804	he	2959	“ Thanks , I ’ll get on this now . Can you do me a favor and try to find out as much about Hayden ’s personal life as you can ? Where he hangs out , partner , that kind of thing . ”
105852	105860	105861	105861	I	2959	“ Okay , I ’m on it . ”
105882	105886	105887	105887	his	2959	“ Come in , ”
105936	105941	105942	105942	He	2959	“ Hello , boss . ”
105985	105993	105994	105994	He	2959	“ It ’s eleven o’clock , Jameson . ”
106005	106022	105994	105994	He	2959	“ I needed something to take the edge off . Do n’t fucking start , Emily . ”
106023	106026	106027	106027	I	2959	“ Okay , ”
106030	106035	106027	106027	I	2959	“ Are you okay ? ”
106036	106041	106042	106042	he	2959	“ I ’m fine , ”
106052	106060	106061	106061	I	2959	“ Three days until our weekend away , ”
106075	106092	106069	106069	he	2959	“ Ca n’t come soon enough . I have to take this . See you tonight . ”

109731	109741	109728	109728	I	2959	“ I could n’t work it out at all . ”
109742	109763	109764	109764	I	2959	“ This is n’t directions to put up a tent — this is a map for an escape from Alcatraz . ”
109769	109774	109775	109775	he	186	“ What ’s funny ? ”
109778	109788	109789	109789	He	186	“ Nothing about this situation is funny , Emily . ”

109848	109885	109886	109886	He	186	“ I wanted to do something with you that you ’ve never done with an ex - girlfriend . I just wanted us to do this first together . Will you just humor me , please ? ”
109897	109945	109890	109890	I	2959	“ I know this is n’t what you ’re used to , but I wanted to take you out of your comfort zone . I really want to do this — it ’s important to me . This is how uncomfortable I feel in your fancy apartment . ”
109946	109950	109951	109951	His	186	“ Not possible . ”
109963	109966	109958	109958	he	186	“ Fine . ”
110042	110055	110056	110056	he	186	“ Okay , it says the poles are in a separate bag , ”

110098	110113	110093	110093	He	186	“ We need to put the poles in the end and hoist them up . ”
110114	110117	110118	110118	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
110125	110128	110129	110129	He	186	“ Emily . ”
110146	110186	110187	110187	I	2959	“ I smell like a toxic dumping ground of bug poison , and I have never felt so unsexy in my entire life . I would n’t be surprised if my dick has been poisoned off like a weed . ”
110192	110213	110214	110214	He	186	“ You could never be unsexy to me , and your dick is more of a tree than a weed . ”
110258	110279	110250	110250	He	186	“ Okay , let ’s just get in and do it , and then we can pump up the bed . ”
110287	110296	110283	110283	His	186	“ We have to pump up a bed ? ”
110297	110310	110311	110311	I	2959	“ No . You have to blow it up with your mouth , ”
110322	110330	110314	110314	He	186	“ That ’s it — I’m out . ”
110336	110353	110354	110354	He	186	“ No , you do n’t . I ’m only teasing . We have a pump . ”
110369	110372	110373	110373	I	2959	“ Jameson . ”
110377	110408	110409	110409	He	186	“ This weekend is symbolic in our relationship . You ’re expecting me to give up everything I know to live in a world that ’s completely foreign to me . ”
110414	110424	110425	110425	I	2959	“ I ’m just asking you for three days . ”
110431	110445	110446	110446	He	186	“ Please . Can you just do this . . . for me ? ”
110472	110484	110463	110463	I	2959	“ I ’ll make it up to you . I promise . ”
110485	110488	110489	110489	he	186	“ Fine , ”
110505	110512	110492	110492	he	186	“ Get me the longest pole . ”
110538	110544	110545	110545	I	2959	“ Come sit with me . ”
110621	110629	110613	110613	I	2959	“ To a successful escape from Alcatraz . ”
110643	110653	110630	110630	He	186	“ Okay , so what do we do now ? ”
110654	110659	110613	110613	I	2959	“ This is it . ”
110660	110665	110666	110666	He	186	“ This is it ? ”
110669	110679	110613	110613	I	2959	“ Yeah . . . you just sit here . ”
110680	110685	110630	110630	He	186	“ And do what ? ”
110686	110689	110613	110613	I	2959	“ Relax . ”
110690	110693	110694	110694	He	186	“ Oh . ”
110775	110781	110757	110757	He	186	“ What are you doing ? ”
110782	110798	110799	110799	He	186	“ I ’m getting plastered so I do n’t remember getting eaten by a bear . ”
110804	110811	110812	110812	I	2959	“ It ’s the only way . ”
110815	110823	110824	110824	He	186	“ This is completely safe , Jameson . ”
110829	110841	110824	110824	He	186	“ That ’s what Daniel said right before he went missing . ”
110842	110847	110860	110860	he	186	“ Who ’s Daniel ? ”
110848	110859	110860	110860	he	186	“ Blair Witch Daniel . . . ever watched it ? ”
110868	110871	110872	110872	I	2959	“ No . ”
110875	110882	110883	110883	He	186	“ Probably best you do n’t . ”
110890	110894	110895	110895	I	2959	“ Hauntingly familiar . ”
110902	110910	110895	110895	I	2959	“ I ’m going to the bathroom . ”
110911	110914	110915	110915	He	186	“ What ? ”
110921	110926	110915	110915	He	186	“ Where ’s that ? ”
110927	110932	110933	110933	His	186	“ Up the trail . ”
110937	110950	110933	110933	His	186	“ You ca n’t walk up there alone . It ’s dangerous . ”
110951	110964	110915	110915	He	186	“ No . I ’m not . You ’re coming with me . ”
110965	110968	110969	110969	He	186	“ What ? ”
110972	110978	110969	110969	He	186	“ Come on , Jay . ”
110979	110998	110999	110999	I	2959	“ No , we are not leaving the campsite . I do n’t want to be walking around . ”
111017	111021	111022	111022	I	2959	“ All right . ”

111119	111122	111123	111123	He	186	“ Maybe . ”
111127	111133	111123	111123	He	186	“ Anybody could be watching . ”
111144	111151	111134	111134	I	2959	“ You coming in , chicken ? ”
111160	111166	111167	111167	he	186	“ Are you fucking insane ? ”

112026	112034	112035	112035	he	186	“ Have you lost your fucking mind ? ”
112038	112045	112035	112035	he	186	“ Who could sleep through this ? ”

112289	112296	112297	112297	I	2959	“ Somebody has to do it . ”
112310	112318	112303	112303	He	186	“ This will fucking do me in . ”

114029	114036	114026	114026	he	186	“ She moved and . . . ”
114042	114045	114037	114037	His	186	“ What ? ”
114046	114069	114070	114070	I	2959	“ We tried the long - distance thing , and I struggled with no sex . It ’s not who I am . ”
114073	114106	114070	114070	I	2959	“ So we made a pact that we would be with other people but try again in a few years . We had a five - year plan of getting back together . ”
114116	114130	114131	114131	I	2959	“ But then a year ago I met this girl on a plane . ”
114134	114146	114131	114131	I	2959	“ And she was everything that I was n’t looking for . ”
114159	114173	114174	114174	He	186	“ But I could n’t pursue her because of my promise to Claudia . ”
114194	114231	114232	114232	He	186	“ I wanted to . I desperately wanted to . I felt a physical connection with her from the word go . I was hard the entire plane trip , and our night together was insane . ”
114236	114268	114269	114269	He	186	“ There was something about her that I could n’t forget . She lingered in the back of my mind . I compared all sex and women with her since then . ”
114279	114290	114291	114291	I	2959	“ They always fell short . . . even Claudia . ”
114300	114324	114291	114291	I	2959	“ Recently I ’d been thinking about her a lot , and I had even contacted the airline and found out her name . ”
114325	114329	114330	114330	I	2959	“ You had ? ”
114340	114399	114337	114337	He	186	“ I got a photocopy of your passport emailed to me just six weeks before you started working for us . I ’d planned on contacting you , but with everything going on at work , I had n’t got around to it yet . I had no idea that you were coming to work for Miles Media . ”
114400	114407	114408	114408	I	2959	“ That explains it , then . ”
114411	114415	114408	114408	I	2959	“ Explains what ? ”
114416	114431	114432	114432	He	186	“ Why you never called . I look like a prisoner in that photo . ”
114435	114440	114441	114441	He	186	“ This is true . ”
114449	114457	114441	114441	He	186	“ Tell me about your past loves . ”
114463	114468	114469	114469	He	186	“ I ca n’t . ”
114472	114490	114491	114491	He	186	“ Since I met you , I ’ve realized that I ’ve never been in love before . ”
114495	114504	114505	114505	I	2959	“ What about the guy with Backseat Barbie ? ”
114508	114513	114505	114505	I	2959	“ You remember him ? ”
114514	114517	114518	114518	He	186	“ Yes . ”
114532	114550	114521	114521	he	186	“ What I felt for them , Jay , and what I feel for you is incomparable . ”
114570	114575	114576	114576	I	2959	“ I love you , ”
114584	114598	114579	114579	He	186	“ Good , because I do n’t camp in hell for just anyone . ”

114768	114772	114763	114763	Her	186	“ For what ? ”
114773	114778	114779	114779	She	186	“ For finding me . ”
114791	114801	114802	114802	she	186	“ We were always going to find each other , ”
114805	114811	114812	114812	I	2959	“ Soul mates do that . ”
114826	114843	114815	114815	I	2959	“ You do n’t really buy into that soul mate mumbo jumbo thing , do you ? ”
114844	114849	114850	114850	She	186	“ I did n’t . ”
114855	114861	114850	114850	She	186	“ Until I met you . ”
114907	114910	114911	114911	she	186	“ Jay , ”
114927	114932	114914	114914	she	186	“ Yeah , baby ? ”
114933	114942	114943	114943	she	186	“ Can we come back here next weekend ? ”
114947	114950	114951	114951	I	2959	“ Really ? ”
114961	114968	114954	114954	She	186	“ I love this old house . ”
114987	114990	114991	114991	She	186	“ Maybe . ”

117874	117884	117885	117885	He	108	“ I came here to find out about Jameson . ”
117901	117911	117912	117912	He	108	“ There ’s no breaking story , is there ? ”
117915	117929	117912	117912	He	108	“ We could make the story about the wild night we spend together . ”
117930	117937	117938	117938	I	2959	“ You ’re a fucking idiot , ”
117941	117949	117938	117938	I	2959	“ I am not interested in you . ”
117950	117958	117959	117959	He	108	“ Oh , but you should be . ”
117974	117978	117959	117959	He	108	“ Stop it . ”
117979	117988	117989	117991	the poor waiter	1696	“ That will be twenty - two dollars , ”
117999	118010	118011	118011	I	2959	“ I ’m not paying for this imbecile ’s wedges , ”
118014	118019	118020	118020	I	2959	“ Goodbye , Jake , ”
118029	118043	118044	118044	he	108	“ Emily . . . come on . We would be great together , ”
118124	118135	118119	118120	the waiter	717	“ Can I have a table for one , please ? ”
118193	118200	118188	118188	She	186	“ I ’m going , babe . ”
118201	118204	118205	118205	She	186	“ Hmm . ”
118220	118231	118205	118205	She	186	“ No , do n’t go . Play hooky today . ”
118238	118250	118251	118251	I	2959	“ I ca n’t ; I have a meeting this morning . ”
118300	118308	118309	118309	I	2959	“ Two days until we go away , ”
118320	118341	118313	118313	She	186	“ Two days is too long , Mr. Miles . One of these days I ’m going to kidnap you . ”
118367	118374	118375	118375	I	2959	“ I ’ve got to go , ”
118381	118397	118375	118375	I	2959	“ If I stay here , I ’m going to fuck you and be late . ”
118398	118401	118402	118402	She	186	“ Good . ”
118405	118412	118413	118413	I	2959	“ Fuck me and be late . ”
118504	118509	118480	118480	Emily	186	“ I love you . ”
118510	118516	118517	118517	She	186	“ I love you more . ”
118566	118569	118570	118570	I	2959	“ Morning . ”
118584	118589	118590	118590	He	1708	“ Everything all right ? ”
118617	118620	118614	118614	I	2959	“ Hi . ”
118629	118635	118621	118621	My	2959	“ What ’s going on ? ”
118636	118640	118641	118641	Elliot	140	“ Get in . ”
118661	118667	118668	118668	I	2959	“ Is dad all right ? ”
118671	118676	118668	118668	I	2959	“ Dad ’s fine . ”
118677	118680	118668	118668	I	2959	“ Mom ? ”
118681	118689	118690	118690	I	2959	“ She ’s great . Get in . ”
118707	118730	118731	118731	Tristan	2430	“ I want you to know that we do n’t believe anything about this , and we are simply here for you , ”
118734	118740	118741	118741	I	2959	“ What ’s going on ? ”
118829	118836	118822	118822	I	2959	“ What the fuck is this ? ”
119010	119016	119002	119002	I	2959	“ When was this taken ? ”
119017	119038	119039	119039	I	2959	“ No idea , but it had to be lately . She has the bracelet on that you bought her . ”
119082	119090	119091	119091	Elliot	140	“ We know it ’s not you , ”
119094	119109	119091	119091	Elliot	140	“ You ’ve been hacked ; we will prove it . I promise you . ”
119110	119113	119114	119114	I	2959	“ What ? ”
119135	119155	119156	119156	Christopher	141	“ There ’ve been transfers , Jameson . Millions of dollars have left our bank accounts with your password , ”
119165	119172	119173	119173	I	2959	“ What are you talking about ? ”
119176	119182	119173	119173	I	2959	“ I do n’t understand . ”
119191	119198	119183	119183	I	2959	“ When was this photo taken ? ”
119199	119211	119212	119212	Tristan	2430	“ This is a setup ; I ’m sure of it , ”
119215	119222	119212	119212	Tristan	2430	“ Emily would n’t do this . ”
119223	119226	119227	119227	I	2959	“ What ? ”
119258	119268	119269	119269	Elliot	140	“ That ’s bullshit , and you know it , ”
119272	119285	119269	119269	Elliot	140	“ The timing of this image going to print is no coincidence . ”
119295	119304	119305	119305	he	140	“ Has Emily been in your apartment alone ? ”
119320	119331	119332	119332	Christopher	141	“ Has she had access to your computers , Jameson ? ”
119341	119350	119335	119335	I	2959	“ Yes . . . but . . . ”
119371	119374	119375	119375	I	2959	“ What ? ”
119378	119417	119375	119375	I	2959	“ I think Emily ’s working with Gabriel Ferrara . It ’s all a little bit too coincidental , if you ask me . She ’s been sent in to keep you occupied while he planned your demise . ”
119418	119421	119422	119422	I	2959	“ What ? ”
119425	119430	119422	119422	I	2959	“ That ’s preposterous . ”
119431	119437	119438	119438	Tristan	2430	“ Yes , it is , ”
119441	119445	119438	119438	Tristan	2430	“ Fucking ridiculous . ”
119446	119451	119452	119452	Elliot	140	“ Think about it , ”
119455	119472	119452	119452	Elliot	140	“ She conveniently shows up here and , within weeks , has you by the balls . ”
119473	119476	119477	119477	I	2959	“ What ? ”
119483	119487	119488	119488	I	2959	“ Fucking bullshit . ”
119513	119522	119502	119502	Elliot	140	“ What ’s this fucking photo , then ? ”
119523	119527	119528	119528	Tristan	2430	“ A setup , ”
119589	119619	119620	119620	Tristan	2430	“ I ’m telling you , man , it ’s a camera angle ; you know better than anyone that the right angle can tell a completely different story , ”
119623	119635	119636	119636	Elliot	140	“ Bullshit . Where there ’s smoke there ’s always fire , ”
119639	119670	119636	119636	Elliot	140	“ Nevertheless , Emily Foster is fucking irrelevant right now . Deal with her later . You ’re being accused of embezzlement . You could go to jail , Jameson . ”
119705	119710	119711	119711	I	2959	“ What ’s happened ? ”
119724	119745	119746	119746	Christopher	141	“ We ’re not sure . Huge bank transfers have been coming out of the accounts , and nobody noticed , ”
119749	119754	119755	119755	I	2959	“ Going to where ? ”
119758	119763	119755	119755	I	2959	“ An offshore account . ”
119764	119776	119777	119777	I	2959	“ How the fuck am I implicated in all of this ? ”
119801	119807	119798	119799	Gabriel Ferrara	2430	“ I do n’t understand . ”
119823	119840	119808	119808	I	2959	“ It ’s coming up that the transfers were made from your log - in details . ”
119841	119844	119845	119845	I	2959	“ What ? ”
119853	119875	119845	119845	I	2959	“ That ’s impossible ; I have n’t been into our business accounts for months . I have no reason to . ”
119876	119883	119884	119884	Tristan	2430	“ That ’s what I said , ”
119887	119901	119884	119884	Tristan	2430	“ I handle the money side of things ; you all know that . ”
119902	119918	119919	119919	Elliot	140	“ We have the accounts and legal team meeting us at the office at eight , ”
119928	119933	119922	119922	My	2959	“ Does Dad know ? ”
119934	119937	119938	119938	He	140	“ Yeah . ”
119942	119949	119938	119938	He	140	“ He ’s meeting us there . ”
120214	120220	120221	120221	I	2959	“ How were your friends ? ”
120224	120236	120237	120237	she	1730	“ Great . . . it was good to see them , ”
120376	120385	120386	120386	He	2430	“ Well , this day fucking sucks already . ”
120395	120399	120386	120386	He	2430	“ You think ? ”
120419	120426	120427	120427	he	2430	“ When was the photo taken ? ”
120430	120434	120435	120435	He	2430	“ Last night . ”
120461	120472	120473	120473	He	2430	“ She said she was out with Molly and Aaron . ”
120488	120496	120497	120497	I	2959	“ I thought she was the one . ”
120506	120513	120497	120497	I	2959	“ That makes two of us . ”
120519	120532	120533	120533	He	2430	“ Let ’s just get through this day and prove your innocence . ”
120556	120560	120553	120553	he	2430	“ You okay ? ”
120574	120585	120586	120586	He	2430	“ We will prove that you ’re innocent , Jay . ”
120595	120600	120601	120601	I	2959	“ I promise you . ”
120630	120639	120640	120640	I	2959	“ Tell me that you ’re all right . ”
120652	120658	120640	120640	I	2959	“ I ’m all right . ”
120659	120678	120640	120640	I	2959	“ Why do I get the feeling that you ’re about to lose your shit and kill someone ? ”
120679	120695	120640	120640	I	2959	“ If you want to save a life today , get rid of Jake Peters . ”
120696	120721	120722	120722	I	2959	“ It ’s already done . I called and fired him this morning at five a.m. , as soon as I saw the story . ”
120746	120755	120740	120740	He	2430	“ Do you want me to fire Emily ? ”
120766	120769	120756	120756	I	2959	“ No . ”
120770	120778	120779	120779	he	2430	“ I was thinking . . . , ”
120782	120786	120787	120787	I	2959	“ Get out , ”
120790	120793	120787	120787	I	2959	“ But — ”
120794	120797	120756	120756	I	2959	“ Now . ”
120903	120909	120910	120910	He	246	“ Good morning , Alan . ”
120913	120916	120910	120910	He	246	“ Morning . ”
121042	121048	121037	121037	Alan	246	“ What are you doing ? ”
121052	121064	121037	121037	Alan	246	“ Mr. Miles instructed me to drop you here this morning . ”
121065	121072	121084	121084	He	246	“ What . . . why ? ”
121073	121083	121084	121084	He	246	“ He suggested that you have the day off . ”
121098	121101	121102	121102	I	2959	“ Huh ? ”
121105	121113	121102	121102	I	2959	“ What ’s going on , Alan ? ”
121114	121143	121144	121144	I	2959	“ I ’m not sure , but Mr. Miles said that he did n’t want you to come into the office and that he will be in touch . ”
121150	121173	121144	121144	I	2959	“ Be in touch — what does that mean ? Why ca n’t I go to the office ? I ’m confused . ”
121174	121186	121187	121187	he	246	“ You need to get out of the car , Emily , ”
121190	121193	121194	121194	He	246	“ What ? ”
121209	121214	121202	121202	I	2959	“ Has something happened ? ”
121223	121229	121215	121215	I	2959	“ Is Jameson all right ? ”
121230	121240	121248	121248	I	2959	“ You need to speak to him , Emily . ”
121241	121247	121248	121248	I	2959	“ Fine , I will , ”
121261	121266	121267	121267	Alan	246	“ Goodbye , Emily , ”
121304	121309	121298	121298	He	186	“ What the fuck ? ”
121395	121399	121400	121400	I	2959	“ Dear God , ”
121533	121544	121545	121545	I	2959	“ I ’m not his fiancée , you fucking idiots , ”
121548	121561	121545	121545	I	2959	“ How many things can you possibly fuck up in one story ? ”
121583	121586	121587	121589	the paper man	186	“ Hey , ”
121595	121603	121587	121589	the paper man	186	“ You did n’t pay for that . ”
121604	121611	121612	121612	I	2959	“ Oh , I ’m sorry , ”
121621	121629	121630	121630	Jameson	186	“ I was distracted . Thank you . ”
121662	121671	121672	121672	he	2300	“ Hey , watch where you ’re going , ”
121675	121678	121679	121679	I	2959	“ Sorry , ”
121688	121693	121682	121682	I	2959	“ Hi , Em . ”
121694	121704	121705	121705	I	2959	“ Tristan , what the hell is going on ? ”
121708	121720	121705	121705	I	2959	“ We ’re in meetings ; I ’ll call you later . ”
121721	121724	121725	121725	He	2300	“ What ? ”
121729	121732	121733	121733	I	2959	“ Ahhh , ”
121775	121786	121787	121787	she	198	“ Hey , chick , do you want a coffee ? ”
121791	121794	121787	121787	she	198	“ Molly , ”
121806	121816	121795	121795	I	2959	“ Oh my God , it ’s all lies . ”
121838	121843	121795	121795	I	2959	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
121844	121848	121849	121849	I	2959	“ The Gazette , ”
121852	121879	121849	121849	I	2959	“ Google the Gazette . There ’s an image on the front page of me kissing Jake , and it says we are having an affair . ”
121880	121883	121795	121795	I	2959	“ What ? ”
121884	121896	121897	121897	I	2959	“ Somebody must have been following me , or . . . ”
121911	121920	121921	121921	I	2959	“ What the fucking hell is going on ? ”
121925	121929	121930	121930	She	198	“ Holy shit . ”
121933	121950	121930	121930	She	198	“ I see it . Wait . . . when the fuck did you kiss Jake ? ”
121951	121958	121959	121959	I	2959	“ He kissed me last night , ”
121962	121978	121959	121959	I	2959	“ I did n’t kiss him back , for fuck ’s sake . Do you — ”
121979	121987	121988	121988	she	198	“ Hang on ; I ’m reading , ”
122007	122012	122013	122013	she	198	“ Oh my God , ”
122016	122034	122013	122013	she	198	“ Alan brought me back to my apartment and told me not to come into work today . ”
122035	122038	122013	122013	she	198	“ What ? ”
122039	122050	122013	122013	she	198	“ He said that Mr. Miles will contact me later . ”
122051	122059	122060	122060	she	198	“ Well , what did Jameson say ? ”
122063	122090	122013	122013	she	198	“ He wo n’t answer his phone . I called Tristan , but he said they are in meetings , and he ’ll call me later . ”
122091	122106	122013	122013	she	198	“ Holy . . . fucking . . . shit . This is bad . ”
122107	122111	122112	122112	I	2959	“ You think ? ”
122115	122123	122112	122112	I	2959	“ What are you going to do ? ”
122124	122135	122013	122013	she	198	“ I do n’t know . What do I do ? ”
122136	122151	122112	122112	I	2959	“ Well , if Jameson told you to stay home , maybe you should . ”

122156	122175	122176	122176	My	2959	“ Because he does n’t need more attention ; it says here he ’s been accused of theft . ”
122193	122201	122202	122202	I	2959	“ But what if he believes this ? ”
122205	122222	122202	122202	I	2959	“ I ’ve never been with Jake . This is complete bullshit . I love him . ”

122682	122701	122702	122702	she	198	“ I could n’t get in to see him ; he was in a meeting with the solicitors , ”
122705	122726	122727	122727	I	2959	“ He ’s got bigger things to worry about at the moment , Em . He could go to prison . ”
122732	122737	122727	122727	I	2959	“ Oh my God . ”
122738	122758	122667	122667	Molly	198	“ Management is going nuts down here . I have to get off the phone before I get fired . ”

122777	122811	122771	122771	I	2959	“ I could give a rat ’s ass about the company right now . I need him to know that I did n’t do anything with Jake . That whole story is bogus . ”
122812	122833	122834	122834	I	2959	“ I know . I ’ll go back up in my lunch break . But for now , hang tight . ”

125499	125520	125495	125495	He	186	“ He kissed me , and I slapped him , and I had no idea that someone took a photo , ”
125542	125553	125554	125554	I	2959	“ Are you at least going to talk to me ? ”
125557	125568	125569	125569	He	186	“ Why did you block my access to this floor ? ”
125574	125582	125569	125569	He	186	“ Because I do n’t trust you . ”
125589	125592	125583	125583	I	2959	“ What ? ”
125593	125607	125608	125608	My	2959	“ You heard me . I do n’t trust you . Get out . ”

125703	125712	125700	125700	I	2959	“ I know it sounds like . . . ”
125713	125721	125722	125722	He	186	“ Like I ca n’t trust you . ”
125734	125751	125722	125722	He	186	“ I have more to worry about at the moment than dealing with a deceitful girlfriend . ”
125752	125755	125756	125756	I	2959	“ Jameson , ”
125759	125775	125776	125776	he	186	“ We have nothing to further talk about , Emily . . . get out , ”

126389	126407	126408	126408	Molly	198	“ You lied to Jameson about where you were going and went out to dinner with Jake , ”
126416	126432	126411	126411	I	2959	“ You got home and then lied again to Jameson about where you had been . ”
126440	126443	126433	126433	I	2959	“ Correct . ”
126444	126447	126448	126448	she	198	“ Now , ”
126451	126474	126448	126448	she	198	“ Jameson ’s whole life is falling apart , and he is being accused of a crime that he did n’t do . ”
126475	126478	126479	126479	I	2959	“ Yes , ”
126487	126502	126479	126479	I	2959	“ The entire world is watching , and you are public enemy number one . ”
126503	126511	126512	126512	I	2959	“ How is this fucking helping me ? ”
126525	126532	126533	126533	Aaron	0	“ This does n’t look good , ”
126536	126540	126541	126541	I	2959	“ I know . ”
126549	126582	126541	126541	I	2959	“ I do n’t know how to help him . I ’ve completely screwed everything up . I ’m the villain in this story , and I want to be the hero . ”
126599	126605	126594	126594	Aarons	218	“ I ’ve got it . ”
126606	126609	126594	126594	Aarons	218	“ Huh ? ”
126610	126620	126621	126621	I	2959	“ I know how you could be the hero . ”
126626	126629	126621	126621	I	2959	“ How ? ”
126630	126649	126650	126650	I	2959	“ Solve the case . . . you ’re a reporter ; you ’ve done this shit before . ”
126657	126671	126650	126650	I	2959	“ Those private investigators are obviously fucking useless ; they are doing nothing . ”
126672	126677	126678	126678	I	2959	“ That ’s true . ”
126681	126702	126678	126678	I	2959	“ But I do n’t know anything about computers . Where would I even start trying to track those transfers ? ”
126703	126732	126733	126733	Molly	198	“ I do n’t know , but finding out where that money has gone yourself does seem like the only way you are getting Jameson out of this . ”
126736	126741	126742	126742	I	2959	“ We could help ? ”
126768	126776	126758	126758	I	2959	“ You know what — you’re right . ”
126786	126798	126799	126799	Molly	198	“ I am going to find out who ’s doing this . ”
126804	126808	126799	126799	Molly	198	“ And when I do”—I
126814	126827	126799	126799	Molly	198	fist—“they will wish they were fucking dead for messing with my man . ”
126828	126831	126832	126832	Molly	198	“ Attagirl . ”
126877	126882	126883	126883	Jameson	186	“ To Operation Hero . ”
127107	127114	127098	127098	he	2430	“ I ’ve got to go . ”
127121	127130	127131	127131	I	2959	“ Look what crawled out of the gutter , ”
127143	127146	127134	127134	He	2430	“ Miles . ”
127152	127160	127161	127161	he	2430	“ How ’s that girl of yours ? ”
127167	127176	127161	127161	he	2430	“ You should put her on a leash . ”
127199	127245	127195	127195	I	2959	“ You know she made a move on me . Seems like you ’ve lost your edge with everything : the company , the bank accounts . Sex . How does it feel to have your woman search for someone who can satisfy her needs ? ”
127296	127301	127281	127281	He	2430	“ Call the police ! ”
127302	127307	127308	127308	I	2959	“ Fuck . . . ”
127601	127604	127596	127596	I	2959	“ Hello ? ”
127605	127611	127596	127596	I	2959	“ Is that Emily Foster ? ”
127612	127615	127596	127596	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
127616	127624	127596	127596	I	2959	“ Can we come up , please ? ”
127625	127630	127631	127631	I	2959	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
127642	127650	127635	127635	my	2959	“ We need to talk to you . ”
127651	127656	127657	127657	I	2959	“ Has something happened ? ”
127660	127667	127657	127657	I	2959	“ Let us in , please . ”
127668	127671	127672	127672	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
127698	127701	127691	127691	I	2959	“ Hello . ”
127712	127718	127691	127691	I	2959	“ Are you Emily Foster ? ”
127719	127722	127723	127723	My	2959	“ Yes . ”
127729	127741	127742	127742	I	2959	“ Can we talk to you for a moment , please ? ”
127746	127753	127742	127742	I	2959	“ Yes , please come in . ”
127754	127766	127767	127767	They	1843	“ We would like to talk to Jameson Miles , please . ”
127781	127786	127767	127767	They	1843	“ Is he here ? ”
127787	127794	127795	127795	I	2959	“ No , he is n’t . ”
127807	127813	127795	127795	I	2959	“ What ’s this about ? ”
127814	127829	127767	127767	They	1843	“ He ’s wanted for questioning in regards to an assault earlier this evening . ”
127830	127833	127834	127834	I	2959	“ What ? ”
127837	127859	127834	127834	I	2959	“ Gabriel Ferrara was attacked tonight outside a restaurant by Mr. Miles . A warrant has been issued for his arrest . ”
127860	127866	127795	127795	I	2959	“ Is he all right ? ”
127867	127882	127883	127883	I	2959	“ Mr. Ferrara has significant facial injuries and has been taken to the hospital . ”
127893	127897	127898	127898	I	2959	“ What happened ? ”
127901	127929	127898	127898	I	2959	“ Mr. Ferrara was getting into a car when Mr. Miles approached him in the dark . A fight broke out , and Mr. Miles assaulted him . ”
127930	127935	127898	127898	I	2959	“ Where was this ? ”
127936	127948	127898	127898	I	2959	“ Out the front of Bryant Park , opposite Lucina ’s . ”
127949	127954	127955	127955	I	2959	“ Oh my God , ”
127958	127964	127955	127955	I	2959	“ Is Jameson all right ? ”
127965	127975	127976	127976	I	2959	“ Witnesses say he ran off through the park . ”
127988	127995	127996	127996	I	2959	“ You have the wrong person , ”
127999	128019	127996	127996	I	2959	“ Jameson would never attack someone . He ’s the CEO of a company , not a pub brawler . ”
128040	128049	128028	128028	Jameson	186	“ I do n’t know where he is , ”
128056	128063	128064	128065	the policeman	1845	“ Can we search your apartment ? ”
128068	128079	128064	128065	the policeman	1845	“ Of course . He ’s not here , though . ”
128110	128152	128103	128103	They	368	“ As soon as you hear from him , you need to call us . If you do n’t , you may be charged with obstruction of justice . Hiding a person of interest from authorities is a very serious offense . ”
128153	128156	128157	128157	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
128169	128173	128174	128175	The officers	1850	“ Good night . ”
128220	128224	128212	128212	he	186	“ Damn it . ”
128233	128236	128212	128212	he	186	“ Hello . ”
128237	128240	128241	128241	I	2959	“ Tristan , ”
128244	128252	128241	128241	I	2959	“ Do you know where Jameson is ? ”
128253	128258	128259	128259	he	186	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
128262	128291	128259	128259	he	186	“ The police were just here , and Jameson apparently assaulted Ferrara . They ’ve issued a warrant for his arrest . Do you know where he is ? ”
128292	128295	128241	128241	I	2959	“ What ? ”
128296	128314	128241	128241	I	2959	“ He ’s not answering my calls , and witnesses said he ran off across the park . ”
128315	128320	128259	128259	he	186	“ What the fuck ? ”
128321	128327	128241	128241	I	2959	“ What do I do ? ”
128328	128339	128241	128241	I	2959	“ I ’ll try calling him and call you back . ”
128340	128343	128344	128344	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
128364	128375	128360	128360	Tristan	2430	“ He ’s not answering . I ’ll come over . ”
128376	128380	128384	128384	Tristan	2430	“ Thank you . ”
128449	128455	128456	128456	I	2959	“ Where could he be ? ”
128459	128470	128471	128471	he	186	“ I do n’t know . Try calling him again , ”
128502	128507	128496	128496	he	186	“ Shh , listen . ”
128548	128551	128529	128529	We	1852	“ Here . ”
128601	128608	128594	128594	His	2430	“ It ’s Jameson ’s phone . ”
128626	128635	128636	128636	I	2959	“ What the hell has happened to him ? ”
128673	128690	128660	128660	Alan	246	“ He ’s probably just hiding out from the police somewhere . He ’ll be fine , ”
128713	128720	128721	128721	I	2959	“ This is all my fault , ”
128727	128744	128721	128721	I	2959	“ If I did n’t go to that setup , none of this would have happened . ”
128745	128753	128721	128721	I	2959	“ What do you mean , setup ? ”
128754	128831	128832	128832	I	2959	“ Jake told me that he had information on a story that Ferrara was publishing the next day about Jameson and that he would tell me out of work . I did n’t want to worry Jameson , so I lied and went to meet him . He just wanted to get me alone , and he kissed me . I slapped him across the face and left , and then the next day . . . ”
128835	128841	128842	128842	He	2959	“ You saw the pictures . ”
128845	128853	128842	128842	He	2959	“ So you were n’t seeing Jake ? ”
128854	128857	128858	128858	I	2959	“ No , ”
128861	128873	128874	128874	I	2959	“ I ’m in love with fucking Jameson , you idiot . ”
128877	128886	128874	128874	I	2959	“ And he wo n’t let me explain . ”
128887	128895	128896	128896	His	2959	“ Fucking hell , what a mess . ”
128905	128908	128909	128909	He	2959	“ Hello . ”
128912	128915	128916	128916	He	2959	“ Yes . ”
128921	128927	128928	128928	He	2959	“ Is he all right ? ”
128939	128943	128931	128931	He	2959	“ Thank God . ”
128944	128947	128948	128948	I	2959	“ What ? ”
128951	128961	128962	128962	He	2959	“ Thank you . I ’m on my way . ”
128966	128969	128970	128970	I	2959	“ What ? ”
128973	128980	128970	128970	I	2959	“ Jameson is in the hospital . ”
128981	128985	128931	128931	He	2959	“ What happened ? ”
128986	128994	128995	128995	My	2959	“ He was hit by a car . ”
129004	129013	128995	128995	My	2959	“ He ’s okay — just a concussion . ”
129014	129020	128970	128970	I	2959	“ Oh , thank God . ”
129021	129030	128995	128995	My	2959	“ I ’m going to go get him . ”
129031	129036	129037	129037	I	2959	“ I ’m coming , ”
129040	129045	129046	129046	He	2959	“ Em . . . ”
129049	129113	129046	129046	He	2959	“ I do n’t think that ’s a good idea . The paps will be everywhere after this Ferrara bullshit , and Jameson does n’t need more publicity . Who knows what reporters are at the hospital ? Jameson specifically wants you kept out of the spotlight . Let me talk to him , and I ’ll call you when we get home . ”
129127	129144	129145	129145	Empathy	221	“ But I did n’t do anything wrong , Tristan . I want to see him . ”
129156	129170	129149	129149	he	2959	“ Let me get him home safely , and I ’ll call you . ”
129185	129216	129171	129171	He	2959	“ I promise I ’ll call you . I ’ll drop you home and then sort him out , and then I ’ll call you . You have my word . ”
129222	129225	129226	129226	We	1853	“ Okay . ”
129234	129254	129255	129255	I	2959	“ I ’m going to find out who stole the money if it ’s the last thing I do , ”
129258	129285	129286	129286	I	2959	“ Emily , that ’s a bad idea . Leave it to the detectives . You ’re tired and emotional . Let ’s get you home . ”
129335	129341	129342	129342	she	1308	“ How ’s the headache ? ”
129345	129349	129350	129350	She	1308	“ Still there . ”
129367	129385	129386	129386	I	2959	“ You have a serious concussion . You ’re very lucky to be alive , young man . ”
129399	129402	129393	129393	Tristan	2430	“ Hey . ”
129403	129406	129407	129407	I	2959	“ Hi . ”
129422	129428	129416	129416	He	2430	“ Are you all right ? ”
129429	129434	129393	129393	Tristan	2430	“ I ’m fine . ”
129435	129441	129442	129443	the nurse	1308	“ He is not fine , ”
129446	129471	129472	129472	Tristan	2430	“ He got hit by a car . He could have been killed . As it is , he has a very serious concussion . ”
129480	129483	129472	129472	Tristan	2430	“ Jesus . ”
129484	129513	129522	129522	Tristan	2430	“ He ’s staying in for the night , and as long as all his preliminary tests come back clear in the morning , he can go home . ”
129514	129521	129522	129522	Tristan	2430	“ Okay . . . thanks . ”
129531	129544	129545	129545	She	1308	“ I ’ll be back in an hour with some pain medication . ”
129548	129555	129556	129556	I	2959	“ I do n’t need it , ”
129559	129566	129567	129567	I	2959	“ I ’ll be back anyway . ”
129578	129581	129582	129582	I	2959	“ Sorry , ”
129585	129607	129608	129608	I	2959	“ Fucking hell , Jay , we ’ve been out of our head with worry . Searching for you all night . ”
129615	129639	129608	129608	I	2959	“ The police came to Emily ’s , and then she called me , and then we found your phone in Bryant Park . ”
129640	129643	129644	129644	I	2959	“ Emily ? ”
129647	129654	129644	129644	I	2959	“ Why did you involve her ? ”
129655	129669	129670	129670	I	2959	“ She ’s frantic , Jameson . She wanted to help find you . ”
129675	129681	129670	129670	I	2959	“ I seriously doubt that . ”
129682	129703	129644	129644	I	2959	“ You know , I do n’t think she is on with that fuckwit Jake . This was a misunderstanding . ”
129704	129708	129709	129709	I	2959	“ Shut up , ”
129713	129729	129709	129709	I	2959	“ No . You shut up . Why wo n’t you even talk to her ? ”
129730	129746	129747	129747	He	2959	“ Because she lied to me . Straight to my face about seeing another man . ”
129751	129776	129747	129747	He	2959	“ And I do n’t need that fucking shit in my life . I have enough going on , if you did n’t notice . ”
129777	129784	129799	129799	I	2959	“ She wants to see you . ”
129785	129798	129799	129799	I	2959	“ Yeah , well , I do n’t want to see her , ”
129802	129816	129817	129817	I	2959	“ Then you need to end it with her ; she ’s frantic . ”
129825	129841	129817	129817	I	2959	“ Just fucking go home . I ’ll get Alan to pick me up tomorrow . ”
129842	129852	129880	129881	The nurse	1308	“ Why wo n’t you even talk about this ? ”
129853	129879	129880	129881	The nurse	1308	“ Because this is none of your business . Emily and I are over . It was over the moment she started lying to me . ”
129884	129889	129890	129890	I	2959	“ I ’m tired , ”
129896	129901	129902	129902	She	1308	“ Yes , okay . ”
129909	129924	129902	129902	She	1308	“ We will call you in the morning when he ’s ready for release . ”
129925	129930	129931	129931	Tristan	2430	“ Yeah , okay , ”
129959	129976	129977	129977	he	2430	“ And what am I supposed to tell Emily ? She ’s waiting for my call , ”
129981	129999	130000	130000	He	2430	“ I do n’t give a fuck what you tell her — she ’s not my problem . ”
130008	130019	130000	130000	He	2430	“ You ’re a selfish son of a bitch sometimes . ”
130020	130026	130027	130027	He	2430	“ And your point is ? ”
130036	130041	130042	130042	Emily	186	“ See you tomorrow . ”
130060	130065	130066	130066	Tristan	2430	“ He ’s okay . ”
130069	130073	130066	130066	Tristan	2430	“ Thank God . ”
130081	130087	130074	130074	I	2959	“ Can I see him ? ”
130088	130107	130074	130074	I	2959	“ He has a bad concussion and is going to be in the hospital for a few days . ”
130108	130111	130074	130074	I	2959	“ What ? ”
130112	130133	130134	130134	My	2959	“ He said it ’s best that you do n’t come down ; he does n’t want the media circus . ”
130155	130161	130147	130147	I	2959	“ He ’s sleeping now . ”
130162	130171	130172	130172	I	2959	“ Did he say anything ? About me ? ”
130182	130193	130194	130194	He	2959	“ How do I get through to him , Tristan ? ”
130198	130237	130194	130194	He	2959	“ I do n’t know . He ’s got a lot of shit going on , Em . I do n’t think he ’s thinking straight at the moment . I ’ll try and talk to him tomorrow . ”
130246	130249	130250	130250	I	2959	“ Okay , ”
130253	130263	130264	130264	God	0	“ Can you call me . . . please ? ”
130285	130295	130276	130276	I	2959	“ I ’m so worried about him , Tristan . ”
130296	130316	130264	130264	God	0	“ We all are , Em . I ’ll call you tomorrow . Just try and get some sleep . ”
130317	130323	130324	130324	I	2959	“ Okay , good night . ”
131451	131459	131460	131460	I	2959	“ Send the text , damn it , ”
131707	131714	131715	131715	Alan	246	“ Are you sure about this ? ”
131723	131739	131718	131718	he	246	“ Yes . It is what it is ; I ’m not hiding any longer , ”
131777	131785	131769	131770	The policeman	1845	“ Can I help you , sir ? ”
131786	131804	131805	131806	The policeman	1845	“ Yes , my name is Jameson Miles , and I would like to hand myself in . ”
131811	131816	131805	131806	The policeman	1845	“ You are wanted ? ”
131817	131861	131862	131863	The policeman	1845	“ I was involved in a fistfight with a man named Gabriel Ferrara and then went to the hospital . I was unaware until late last night that you were looking for me . My apologies for taking so long to get here . ”
131866	131873	131874	131874	He	1845	“ Thank you for coming in . ”
131884	131890	131874	131874	He	1845	“ Please come this way . ”
131927	131931	131912	131912	I	2959	“ Gabriel Ferrara , ”
131937	131957	131958	131958	I	2959	“ It ’s Jameson Miles . I ’m out in front of your building . Get down here now . ”

139268	139283	139284	139284	He	246	“ Why would you wear condoms when I know how much you hate them ? ”
139296	139304	139284	139284	He	246	“ I do n’t want any accidents . ”
139305	139308	139309	139309	He	246	“ What ? ”
139320	139331	139332	139332	He	246	“ You think I would trap you by getting pregnant ? ”

139352	139357	139343	139343	I	2959	“ Are you serious ? ”

139694	139745	139673	139673	He	2959	“ I do n’t want marriage and babies . I do n’t want the same things as you . I ’m not cut out to do normal , Emily . I ’m married to my job . It will never change . I ’ve thought long and hard about this . ”

139862	139876	139877	139877	I	2959	“ If you walk out that door now , we are over forever , ”
139885	139889	139890	139890	He	2959	“ I know . ”
139915	139929	139930	139930	I	2959	“ This is for the best ; another man can make you happier . ”

139958	139963	139964	139964	I	2959	“ Go to hell , ”
139973	139979	139980	139980	He	2959	“ I ’m already there . ”
140227	140240	140241	140241	My	2959	“ When someone shows themselves to you . . . believe them . ”
140291	140297	140298	140298	he	186	“ Jim does n’t exist , ”

140344	140367	140308	140308	Tristan	2430	“ Lara Aspin ’s computer — there ’s evidence on there that it was used to log in to our bank accounts . ”
140368	140371	140372	140372	I	2959	“ What ? ”
140378	140403	140404	140404	I	2959	“ We do n’t have details yet , but the computer analysts just called to let us know that the history is very promising . ”
140407	140412	140404	140404	I	2959	“ That ’s great . ”
140413	140438	140308	140308	Tristan	2430	“ I ’ll see you in the office in the morning ? Come up to the top floor as soon as you get in . ”

140586	140589	140590	140590	I	2959	“ Really ? ”
140595	140600	140601	140601	I	2959	“ That ’s great . ”
140605	140611	140601	140601	I	2959	“ Is Moll here yet ? ”

140871	140882	140883	140883	Tristan	2430	“ The evidence is all on the computer , Em . ”
140886	140916	140883	140883	Tristan	2430	“ You did it ; you solved the case . I do n’t know why you kept following her , but boy , am I glad that you did . ”
140917	140923	140929	140929	Jameson	186	“ Happy I could help . ”

141042	141047	141048	141048	he	186	“ What ’s this ? ”
141051	141057	141058	141058	He	186	“ My letter of resignation . ”
141066	141071	141072	141072	He	186	“ No , Em . ”
141077	141084	141072	141072	He	186	“ I ca n’t accept this . ”
141099	141108	141090	141090	I	2959	“ I ca n’t work here , Jameson . ”
141109	141121	141122	141122	he	186	“ You love Miles Media — working here was your dream , ”
141125	141164	141122	141122	he	186	“ No . You ’re wrong . I loved you . . . and you were my dream . I ’ve taken a position with Athena , the place I did my internships . I start next Monday . ”
141170	141175	141122	141122	he	186	“ Em . . . ”
141193	141205	141206	141206	He	186	“ You know , I watched Magic Mike XXL last night . ”
141209	141225	141206	141206	He	186	“ And there was this poignant line that finally made everything make sense to me . ”
141226	141230	141206	141206	He	186	“ Which was ? ”
141231	141244	141245	141245	He	186	“ When someone shows themselves to you . . . believe them . ”
141251	141259	141245	141245	He	186	“ I finally believe you , Jameson . ”
141260	141264	141206	141206	He	186	“ Believe what ? ”
141265	141272	141273	141273	He	186	“ That you ’re a coward . ”
141278	141288	141273	141273	He	186	“ That you ’re too scared to love me . ”
141303	141317	141318	141318	He	186	“ And I deserve someone who knows that I ’m worth the risk . ”
141327	141338	141318	141318	He	186	“ You ’re just not brave enough to love me . ”
141339	141345	141346	141346	he	186	“ That ’s not fair , ”
141349	141352	141353	141353	I	2959	“ No . ”
141359	141404	141353	141353	I	2959	“ Falling in love with you is what is n’t fair . I never stood a chance . . . you knew that all along . You keep your heart in a tightly sealed Miles - High icebox , only to be looked at . ”
141558	141563	141547	141547	Tristan	2430	“ We celebrating already ? ”
141564	141569	141570	141570	He	2430	“ Seems that way . ”
141574	141579	141570	141570	He	2430	“ Where ’s Emily ? ”
141580	141584	141585	141585	I	2959	“ She left . ”
141606	141613	141598	141598	I	2959	“ She resigned . Effective immediately . ”
141614	141617	141618	141618	His	2430	“ What ? ”
141622	141629	141618	141618	His	2430	“ You ca n’t be serious . ”
141630	141637	141598	141598	I	2959	“ It ’s for the best . ”
141638	141650	141618	141618	His	2430	“ What the fuck ? How is it for the best ? ”
141651	141665	141666	141666	I	2959	“ We were never going to work , Tris ; you knew that . ”
141669	141702	141666	141666	I	2959	“ There ’s always going to be an asshole like Ferrara prepared to step on her to bring me down . I do n’t want her dragged through the mud any further . ”
141703	141712	141713	141713	he	2430	“ Is that what you ’re telling yourself ? ”
141722	141748	141716	141716	I	2959	“ I do n’t fucking get you , man ; you ’re madly in love with her . Why are you really letting her go ? ”
141757	141769	141749	141749	I	2959	“ She deserves better than the life I can give her . ”
141770	141774	141775	141775	he	2430	“ Fuck off , ”
141778	141801	141775	141775	he	2430	“ She could n’t get a better life than the one you could give her . She would never want for anything . ”
141802	141811	141812	141812	I	2959	“ It ’s not the money she wants , ”
141816	141822	141812	141812	I	2959	“ What does she want ? ”
141823	141828	141829	141829	I	2959	“ Things . . . ”
141839	141851	141832	141832	I	2959	“ Things . . . I ’m incapable of giving her . ”
141852	141856	141861	141861	He	2430	“ Like what ? ”
141857	141860	141861	141861	He	2430	“ Time . ”
141868	141877	141878	141878	I	2959	“ But you committed to Claudia no problem . ”
141888	141894	141878	141878	I	2959	“ What does that mean ? ”
141895	141951	141952	141952	I	2959	“ I did n’t care if Claudia was waiting at home for me . I did n’t care how much time I spent away from her . I could travel , work , focus . . . I was content to put her fourth or fifth in line , and she never expected anything different . ”
141967	141972	141956	141956	I	2959	“ Claudia was easy . ”
141973	141982	141983	141983	I	2959	“ Because you did n’t really love her ? ”
142003	142033	141995	141995	He	2959	“ You ’re more than a CEO , Jameson . You deserve to be happy too . Why do you think it has to be one or the other ? ”
142039	142062	142034	142034	I	2959	“ Do n’t let the love of your life walk away because you ’re scared that you ’re going to lose her . ”
142063	142084	142094	142094	he	2959	“ It ’s inevitable , Tristan . . . eventually , she will leave . Her hand will be forced . ”
142085	142093	142094	142094	he	2959	“ And then what will you be ? ”
142097	142108	142094	142094	he	2959	“ A lonely , stressed - out , alcoholic CEO ? ”
142116	142121	142122	142122	He	2959	“ Oh , wait . ”
142128	142134	142135	142135	He	2959	“ That ’s already happening . ”
142142	142159	142135	142135	He	2959	“ When I find my woman , I ’ll move heaven and hell to keep her . ”
142160	142164	142165	142165	I	2959	“ Get out . ”
142168	142180	142165	142165	I	2959	“ You have no idea what you ’re fucking talking about . ”
142181	142200	142201	142201	he	2959	“ Actually , I ’m kind of glad I ’m getting to watch you fuck up your life , ”
142210	142219	142204	142204	he	2959	“ Now I know what not to do . ”
142245	142250	142240	142240	I	2959	“ Yes , Sammia . ”
142251	142262	142263	142263	I	2959	“ The detectives are here to see you , sir . ”
142275	142283	142284	142284	Emily	186	“ Thank you , send them in . ”
142285	142289	142290	142290	Molly	198	“ A toast . ”

142599	142606	142593	142593	she	198	“ I thought my navy suit . ”
142612	142621	142607	142607	I	2959	“ I want to look professional and smart . ”

142654	142666	142651	142651	Molly	198	“ I loved that skirt ! I would have had it . ”
142667	142674	142675	142675	I	2959	“ That was a troublemaking skirt , ”
142678	142694	142675	142675	I	2959	“ Trust me ; you do n’t want that kind of negativity in your life . ”

145734	145737	145738	145738	he	2430	“ Liar , ”
145745	145770	145771	145771	I	2959	“ Hey , the boys and I have organized a trip to Vegas for us this weekend . The jet ’s all lined up . ”
145784	145855	145856	145856	He	2430	“ It ’ll be great . Drinking , gambling . Join some beautiful women to the Miles - High Club . You need to snap out of this and get back on the horse . I ’m thinking a blonde or two . . . forget about the brunettes for a while , and besides , we need to celebrate your innocence . Elliot and Christopher fly in on Friday . ”
145866	145874	145875	145875	I	2959	“ Yeah , that sounds completely shit , ”
145879	145892	145875	145875	I	2959	“ I do n’t care what you say . You ’re coming . ”
145914	145923	145910	145910	He	2430	“ I ’m worried about you , Jay . ”
145929	145942	145924	145924	I	2959	“ We all are . You ’re acting completely out of character . ”
145943	145948	145949	145949	I	2959	“ I ’m fine , ”
145967	145984	145985	145985	he	2430	“ Why do n’t you just go to her house if you want to see her ? ”
145988	145995	145985	145985	he	2430	“ I tried that last night . ”
145996	146002	146003	146003	I	2959	“ How did it go ? ”
146010	146018	146019	146019	I	2959	“ She went postal and . . . ”
146029	146048	146019	146019	I	2959	“ I took her yellow roses , and she smashed the fuck out of them like a madman . ”
146049	146052	146053	146053	He	2430	“ Yeah ? ”
146063	146076	146053	146053	He	2430	“ Why would you take her yellow roses and not red ones ? ”
146077	146083	146084	146084	I	2959	“ I thought . . . ”
146088	146113	146084	146084	I	2959	“ I thought yellow was safe , signifying friendship so that she would talk to me . I just wanted to talk to her . ”
146114	146127	146053	146053	He	2430	“ You did n’t tell her that , though , did you ? ”
146128	146131	146132	146132	He	2430	“ Yeah . ”
146146	146153	146132	146132	He	2430	“ How did that go down ? ”
146154	146166	146084	146084	I	2959	“ That ’s about the time she turned into the Hulk . ”
146167	146178	146179	146179	My	2959	“ I do n’t blame her , to be honest . ”
146187	146196	146179	146179	My	2959	“ You well and truly fucked her over . ”

146218	146250	146266	146266	I	2959	“ Listen , you can lie to yourself all you want to . But do n’t bother lying to me . You ’re a bad liar . . . the worst . ”
146251	146265	146266	146266	I	2959	“ Fuck off , man ; it ’s too early for this shit . ”
146269	146272	146273	146277	the girl behind the counter	2092	“ Tristan , ”
146293	146303	146280	146280	He	2430	“ You staying here , being a miserable prick ? ”

147251	147260	147261	147261	she	356	“ I should ask you the same thing , ”

147291	147304	147305	147305	Her	356	“ I just need some time off after all that embezzlement shit . ”
147310	147317	147305	147305	Her	356	“ Good , I ’m glad . ”
147318	147325	147326	147326	I	2959	“ Can I get you anything ? ”
147334	147342	147326	147326	I	2959	“ Some tea , please , darling . ”
147391	147397	147381	147381	She	356	“ Did Tristan send you ? ”
147406	147413	147381	147381	She	356	“ He ’s worried about you . ”
147414	147421	147381	147381	She	356	“ I ’m fine , Mom . ”
147422	147438	147381	147381	She	356	“ I ’ll be the judge of that . What ’s going on with Emily ? ”

147458	147461	147381	147381	She	356	“ Because ? ”
147468	147475	147462	147462	I	2959	“ Look at me , Jameson . ”
147483	147492	147493	147493	she	356	“ Why are n’t you with Emily anymore ? ”
147496	147501	147502	147502	She	356	“ Emily deserves better . ”
147506	147509	147510	147510	I	2959	“ Ferrara . ”
147519	147529	147510	147510	I	2959	“ I do n’t want this life for her . ”
147530	147544	147545	147545	I	2959	“ You do n’t want her being with a workaholic , you mean ? ”
147556	147570	147545	147545	I	2959	“ So , you ended it with her . . . for her ? ”
147580	147588	147571	147571	I	2959	“ Well that proves it , Jameson . ”
147589	147593	147602	147602	I	2959	“ Proves what ? ”
147594	147601	147602	147602	I	2959	“ That she ’s the one . ”
147605	147623	147602	147602	I	2959	“ You know , ever since you were a tiny little boy , you ’ve done this . ”
147624	147628	147631	147631	she	356	“ Done what ? ”
147635	147661	147662	147662	I	2959	“ When you were very little , maybe three or four years old , you used to have this little pale - blue pickup truck . ”
147665	147693	147694	147694	I	2959	“ You loved it . It fit in the palm of your hand , and you always carried it around . It was your pride and joy . ”
147698	147768	147769	147769	I	2959	“ The thing is , Tristan loved it too . He had his own , but yours was the special one . And even though you loved that truck with all of your heart , the moment that Tristan got upset about anything . . . you would give it to him . You could n’t stand seeing him upset , and you felt responsible to make him happy . ”
147772	147825	147829	147829	hers	2103	“ As you grew up , I watched you do this many times , Jameson , with many things . To the outside world you were aloof and cold , but for the ones you loved , you would do anything to make them happy . You have more heart than sense . ”
147831	147845	147829	147829	hers	2103	“ Why do you think that Emily would n’t be happy with you ? ”
147862	147874	147875	147875	I	2959	“ Because eventually , I ’m going to let her down , ”
147882	147902	147903	147903	I	2959	“ Jameson darling , how ? By working too hard ? By being too honorable to your family business ? ”
147908	147939	147903	147903	I	2959	“ I ’m in love with a man just like you , Jameson . You know him well , your father . He , like you , is a workaholic . ”
147940	147946	147947	147947	I	2959	“ How . . . ? ”
147950	147962	147947	147947	I	2959	“ I do n’t know how to do both , Mom . ”
147963	147969	147970	147970	I	2959	“ Then work it out . ”
147975	148001	148002	148002	I	2959	“ Emily loves you , Jameson , not your money . . . or your company . She loves you . . . just you . ”
148007	148022	148002	148002	I	2959	“ Stop being so damn selfless , and do what you want to do . ”
148023	148033	148034	148034	I	2959	“ I do n’t know what that is anymore , ”
148037	148042	148043	148043	she	2103	“ Oh , nonsense , ”
148046	148067	148043	148043	she	2103	“ Tell me something . If you were on a deserted island , who would you want by your side ? ”
148068	148071	148072	148072	I	2959	“ Emily , ”
148077	148109	148110	148110	I	2959	“ Being in love is like being on a deserted island , Jameson . You focus on them and them only , and you make everything else fit around that person . ”
148114	148146	148147	148147	I	2959	“ If you do n’t want to travel into the future with her , do n’t . But do n’t you dare pull away from your own happiness to protect her . ”
148155	148198	148199	148199	She	2104	“ How one man can be so ruthless in business and so giving to those he loves , I will never understand . . . but , the fact that your father is your carbon copy , I know it ’s possible . ”
148207	148249	148199	148199	She	2104	“ The man I love and the man that the world knows are two very different men . . . and that ’s just how I like it . I like that I ’m the only one who gets his softness . ”
148254	148289	148250	148250	I	2959	“ I am your father ’s world , Jameson ; he made it work around the company . Never once have I felt neglected or unloved . I have always come first to him . ”
148303	148384	148295	148295	her	2104	“ The man that Emily loves and the one that you think you are are two very different men . You need to allow yourself to be who you are with Emily and be the Jameson Miles that the world knows . It ’s not one or the other like you think it is . The fact that you have put Emily ’s happiness ahead of your own cements that she is the one who has been chosen for you . ”

150490	150530	150531	150531	He	2774	“ Because you love me . . . and two wrongs do n’t make a right . If you do n’t let me make this right between us out of stubbornness , which is a real possibility . . . ”

152782	152791	152775	152775	Jameson	186	“ I ’ll have what she ’s having . ”
152804	152822	152792	152792	I	2959	“ All right , we ’ll have a bottle of the Henschke Hill of Grace , please . ”
152823	152828	152829	152830	The waiter	717	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
152858	152869	152870	152870	he	186	“ Do you know how much I ’ve missed you ? ”
152885	152891	152873	152873	I	2959	“ Did you miss me ? ”
152941	152944	152945	152945	He	186	“ Em . ”
152948	152953	152945	152945	He	186	“ I . . . ”
152966	152977	152958	152958	he	186	“ When I saw that image of you kissing Jake — ”
152978	152981	152982	152982	I	2959	“ Jameson , ”
153000	153022	153023	153023	He	186	“ Something snapped inside of me . I was so thrown that it upset me so deeply that I . . . ”
153030	153044	153045	153045	Our	2168	“ I was furious — firstly with you , but then with myself . ”
153050	153081	153082	153082	I	2959	“ I was going through so much shit at work , and the very last person on earth that I thought would lie to me . . . was you . ”
153089	153117	153118	153118	I	2959	“ And then when I calmed down after a few days and realized that you had been set up , the future mapped itself out to me . ”
153121	153142	153118	153118	I	2959	“ There is always going to be someone like Ferrara who is prepared to step on you to hurt me . ”
153147	153157	153118	153118	I	2959	“ And I do n’t want that for you . ”
153158	153161	153162	153162	I	2959	“ Jay , ”
153166	153240	153162	153162	I	2959	“ I do n’t want you to be married to a workaholic who has to travel all the time and is stressed out of his head . I do n’t want you to have to remind your husband not to drink too much or stop being rude to people because he ’s too busy to care . I do n’t want you to have to remind your husband that he ’s neglecting you . ”
153241	153247	153248	153249	The waiter	717	“ Your bottle of wine . ”
153265	153269	153270	153270	I	2959	“ Thank you , ”
153288	153313	153282	153283	The waiter	717	“ I do n’t want you to come second to Miles Media . I do n’t want you to ever come second to anything . ”
153314	153317	153326	153326	he	717	“ But — ”
153318	153325	153326	153326	he	717	“ Let me finish , please , ”
153344	153369	153329	153329	I	2959	“ The thing is , if you ’re with me — married to me — your life is going to be all those things . ”
153378	153393	153394	153394	He	717	“ I love you too much to let you live that life , Em . ”
153424	153438	153406	153406	He	717	“ Do n’t cry . I hate that you ’ve cried over me . ”
153451	153492	153439	153439	I	2959	“ I made a decision to protect you from that life . To push you away . Because I knew that one day , you would eventually be unhappy . . . and I just ca n’t live with that . ”
153493	153502	153503	153503	I	2959	“ It was n’t your decision to make , ”
153510	153533	153507	153507	He	717	“ My job is to look after you and make the hard calls , ones that you ca n’t make for yourself . ”
153534	153537	153538	153538	I	2959	“ Jameson . ”
153545	153556	153557	153557	He	717	“ But something happened while I was away from you . ”
153568	153582	153557	153557	He	717	“ I realized that I did n’t want any of those things either . ”
153588	153610	153611	153611	He	717	“ I ca n’t live without you , Em . I ’ve been so fucking miserable that it ’s been unbearable . ”
153633	153674	153675	153675	I	2959	“ If you do n’t want me as I am now , I ’ll resign from Miles Media immediately , and we can move to bumfuck nowhere and , I do n’t know , live in a fucking tent somewhere . ”
153678	153682	153683	153683	I	2959	“ You idiot , ”
153697	153714	153686	153686	He	717	“ I love you how you are . I do n’t want you to change anything . ”
153715	153719	153689	153689	he	717	“ You do ? ”
153720	153728	153729	153729	I	2959	“ But I do n’t . . . ”
153739	153752	153729	153729	I	2959	“ How can I move on from how you ’ve treated me ? ”
153753	153759	153686	153686	He	717	“ I do n’t know . ”
153760	153781	153689	153689	he	717	“ I ca n’t just pretend that this has n’t happened , Jameson . You ’ve hurt me too deeply . ”
153782	153793	153794	153794	he	2154	“ I know ; I do n’t want you to , ”
153797	153806	153807	153807	He	2154	“ But ca n’t we just . . . ”
153810	153819	153807	153807	He	2154	“ Start dating again ? Take it slow . ”
153829	153868	153820	153820	I	2959	“ I know it ’s going to take time to get back to where we were , but we have the rest of our lives . We can date and get to know each other properly this time . ”
153884	153914	153915	153915	He	2154	“ You know , I always imagined that I would find my dream guy and fall in love , and then it would come to this big cheesy climax . ”
153921	153930	153915	153915	He	2154	“ Cheesy climax ? That just sounds wrong . ”
153943	153950	153931	153931	I	2959	“ No , I meant proposal . ”
153951	153958	153959	153959	He	2154	“ You want a cheesy proposal ? ”
153962	153971	153959	153959	He	2154	“ Would n’t you want a romantic proposal ? ”
153972	153990	153931	153931	I	2959	“ Not really . My point is , this is n’t how I imagined things would go . ”
153991	153995	153996	153996	He	2154	“ Me neither . ”
154003	154031	153996	153996	He	2154	“ Far from it . I ’m officially an idiot . Give me another chance , Em . I wo n’t fuck it up , I promise . ”
154037	154046	154047	154047	He	2154	“ I love you ; you love me . ”
154050	154084	154085	154085	He	2154	“ We can work through this , and then hopefully in time , you can forget it ever happened , and you can live happily ever after with an outdoorsy Kung Fu Panda . ”
154089	154098	154085	154085	He	2154	“ You ’re an idiot , Mr. Miles . ”
154099	154108	154109	154109	He	2154	“ Who ’s hopelessly in love with you . ”
154124	154131	154132	154132	he	2154	“ I love you , cheesecake , ”
154135	154143	154144	154144	He	2154	“ Do n’t call me fucking cheesecake . ”
154150	154154	154144	154144	He	2154	“ Too far ? ”
154155	154160	154163	154163	We	2172	“ Way too far . ”
154236	154239	154240	154240	He	2154	“ Tristan . ”
154246	154252	154240	154240	He	2154	“ How did it go ? ”
154258	154281	154282	154282	Jameson	186	“ Text back , ‘ Not out of the woods yet . Still may be found dead in a ditch tomorrow . ’ ”
154285	154309	154310	154310	He	2154	“ No , I ’m not writing that . If it actually happens , I do n’t want you to go to prison . ”
154326	154333	154334	154334	He	2154	“ You would n’t kill me . ”
154347	154352	154353	154353	He	2154	“ Would n’t I ? ”
154373	154377	154378	154378	I	2959	“ Good night , ”
154381	154384	154378	154378	I	2959	“ What ? ”
154385	154392	154378	154378	I	2959	“ You ’re not coming in . ”
154393	154397	154378	154378	I	2959	“ Why not ? ”
154398	154411	154378	154378	I	2959	“ Jameson , I am still eighty percent pissed off with you . ”
154412	154426	154427	154427	He	2154	“ Yes . I know . Let me make it up to you . ”
154443	154463	154431	154431	I	2959	“ There is nothing sexual that you could do that would make up for how you have treated me . ”
154468	154570	154464	154464	His	2154	“ When I agreed to try again , it was just that . . . to try again . I ’m not promising anything , and I do n’t know how this is going to turn out . I honestly do n’t know if we can get back what we had . The morning you left me after the second stopover , you broke something between us . I have never been so upset in all of my life . It was devastating for me . Having sex with you now is the very last thing that I want to do . ”
154571	154574	154575	154575	he	2154	“ Em , ”
154578	154601	154575	154575	he	2154	“ I could n’t talk to you because it killed me to push you away . I was battling myself over it . ”
154602	154608	154609	154609	He	2154	“ Good night , Jameson . ”
154616	154626	154627	154627	I	2959	“ Well , when will I see you again ? ”
154630	154650	154627	154627	I	2959	“ It ’s Thursday , and I ’m away for the weekend , so next week , I guess . ”
154651	154655	154656	154656	he	2154	“ Next week ? ”
154659	154667	154656	154656	he	2154	“ That ’s like four days away . ”
154668	154672	154673	154673	I	2959	“ Is it ? ”
154712	154720	154721	154721	he	2154	“ Well , that ’s too long , ”
154724	154741	154721	154721	he	2154	“ I have n’t seen you for a month . I need more time with you . ”
154742	154749	154750	154750	I	2959	“ Take it or leave it , ”
154753	154756	154757	154757	I	2959	“ Em ? ”
154841	154849	154850	154850	he	2154	“ I ’ll sleep on the lounge , ”
154853	154873	154850	154850	he	2154	“ I ca n’t be away from you for one more night . Do n’t ask that of me . ”
154890	154896	154897	154897	His	2154	“ Good night , Jameson . ”
155190	155198	155209	155209	He	186	“ Good morning , my beautiful girl . ”
155199	155202	155203	155203	I	2959	“ Hi . ”
155232	155239	155240	155240	He	186	“ How did my girl sleep ? ”
155253	155258	155240	155240	He	186	“ Fine , thanks . ”
155259	155270	155271	155271	he	186	“ Can we get a civilized lift to work today ? ”
155291	155294	155295	155295	I	2959	“ Um . ”
155298	155311	155312	155312	He	186	“ You go with Alan . I want to catch the bus . ”
155320	155327	155312	155312	He	186	“ Okay , bus it is . ”
155328	155350	155377	155377	He	186	“ You do n’t have to walk me to work , Jameson . I ’m quite capable of getting myself there . ”
155351	155376	155377	155377	He	186	“ I know ; I just want to spend the twenty minutes with you . I ’m not seeing you all weekend , remember ? ”
155402	155414	155392	155392	We	2192	“ Have you heard anything more about Lara Aspin and Hayden ? ”
155415	155453	155454	155454	I	2959	“ No . They ’ve been charged , but the court case wo n’t be for a while . I ca n’t believe you solved it . You do n’t know how grateful I am to you . ”
155462	155471	155472	155472	he	186	“ How do you like your new job ? ”
155478	155483	155475	155475	I	2959	“ It ’s great . ”
155489	155508	155475	155475	I	2959	“ Great as in ‘ really great , ’ or great as in ‘ it will do ’ ? ”
155509	155522	155475	155475	I	2959	“ Great as in ‘ I ’m getting used to it . ’ ”
155523	155534	155475	155475	I	2959	“ Why do n’t you come back to Miles Media ? ”
155535	155550	155475	155475	I	2959	“ No . I ’ll be keeping our work lives separate from now on . ”
155551	155554	155555	155555	He	186	“ Hmm . ”
155560	155565	155555	155555	He	186	“ We ’ll see . ”
155658	155663	155664	155664	he	186	“ That ’s it , ”
155679	155703	155704	155704	I	2959	“ No more fucking buses . We need to be disinfected right now . Did you see the people on that fucking bus ? ”
155707	155715	155704	155704	I	2959	“ That was just a bad trip . ”
155716	155723	155724	155724	he	186	“ I mean it , Emily , ”
155727	155749	155724	155724	he	186	“ No more fucking buses . Alan is now your driver . Over my dead body are we catching another bus . ”

156557	156568	156569	156569	I	2959	“ Mental note to never buy anything yellow ever again . ”
156574	156581	156582	156582	he	186	“ You have a good weekend , ”
156586	156590	156582	156582	he	186	“ You too . ”
156591	156602	156549	156549	I	2959	“ I ’m not going to call you this weekend . ”
156603	156607	156608	156608	I	2959	“ Why not ? ”
156611	156620	156608	156608	I	2959	“ Your words are playing on my mind . ”
156621	156625	156582	156582	he	186	“ What words ? ”
156626	156637	156638	156638	I	2959	“ You told me not to force this between us . ”
156641	156647	156638	156638	I	2959	“ I ’m stepping back . ”
156652	156658	156638	156638	I	2959	“ You ’re giving up ? ”
156659	156699	156700	156700	I	2959	“ No . Just the opposite ; I ’m making plans for our future . But I understand that you need time . Me forcing you to forgive me before you ’re ready may not be the smartest move . ”
156713	156726	156727	156727	he	2959	“ You just call me whenever you want to speak to me , ”
156730	156733	156727	156727	he	2959	“ Okay . ”
156734	156756	156757	156757	I	2959	“ And that could be fifty times a day . I ’ll be waiting for your call like a lovesick schoolboy . ”
156780	156783	156768	156768	I	2959	“ Okay . ”
156784	156789	156794	156794	I	2959	“ Goodbye , Emily . ”
156790	156793	156794	156794	I	2959	“ Goodbye , ”
156939	156951	156952	156952	he	246	“ Would you like me to carry this in for you ? ”
156955	156961	156962	156962	I	2959	“ No , thank you . ”
156985	157002	157005	157005	him	246	“ Would you be able to put the rose in some water for me , please ? ”
157011	157015	157016	157016	He	246	“ Of course . ”
157022	157037	157016	157016	He	246	“ I ’ll put it in water at Mr. Miles ’s apartment for you . ”
157038	157042	157043	157043	I	2959	“ Thank you . ”
157050	157055	157043	157043	I	2959	“ Goodbye , Alan . ”
157056	157069	157016	157016	He	246	“ I ’ll see you on Sunday when we pick you up . ”

157098	157109	157110	157110	I	2959	“ Hello . I have a booking for Emily Foster . ”
157124	157127	157128	157128	She	2213	“ Hello . ”
157136	157154	157155	157155	I	2959	“ Ah yes , Ms. Foster . I see you have amended your booking to first class . ”
157158	157161	157162	157162	She	2213	“ No . ”
157167	157179	157162	157162	She	2213	“ Yes , your two tickets were upgraded late last night . ”
157180	157184	157201	157201	Jameson	186	“ Two tickets ? ”
157185	157200	157201	157201	Jameson	186	“ Yes , a second was booked , and then they were both upgraded . ”
157203	157214	157215	157215	I	2959	“ Oh , I see . Okay , thank you . ”
157241	157247	157248	157249	the bartender	2215	“ What will it be ? ”
157257	157263	157248	157249	the bartender	2215	“ A margarita , please . ”
157766	157769	157760	157760	I	2959	“ Hello . ”
157770	157773	157774	157774	He	186	“ Hi . ”
157780	157788	157774	157774	He	186	“ You were n’t calling me tonight ? ”
157789	157794	157801	157801	he	186	“ I got distracted . ”
157804	157807	157801	157801	he	186	“ Em . ”
157808	157811	157774	157774	He	186	“ Yes . ”
157812	157823	157824	157824	I	2959	“ Did you go there to get away from me ? ”
157831	157836	157837	157837	I	2959	“ No , Jameson , ”
157841	157856	157837	157837	I	2959	“ Why is everything about you ? I booked this trip two weeks ago . ”
157857	157872	157873	157873	Tears	241	“ Okay , I just asked . Jesus . Why are you so angry ? ”
157879	157886	157873	157873	Tears	241	“ You really have to ask ? ”
157887	157893	157837	157837	I	2959	“ You tell me why . ”
157910	157950	157951	157951	I	2959	“ Because I ’m in love with a selfish fucking asshole , and I do n’t know how to turn it off , and I ’m waiting for the other shoe to drop and for you walk away again , ”
157962	157979	157980	157980	He	2227	“ And the way you just march back in and demand my forgiveness pisses me off . ”
157983	158020	157980	157980	He	2227	“ And you could have any woman in the world ; they are lining up for you . So why are you putting me through this shit ? I do n’t want the heartache , Jameson . ”
158021	158037	158038	158038	Tears	241	“ Is that what you think ? That I want any woman in the world ? ”
158051	158063	158038	158038	Tears	241	“ I have no idea what you want anymore , Jameson . ”
158064	158072	158073	158073	he	2959	“ Cut the fucking shit , Emily , ”
158076	158170	158073	158073	he	2959	“ You listen , and you listen good . I do n’t want anyone else . I ’ve been promiscuous since I was eighteen years old . I ’ve slept with a lot of women . . . and I mean a lot of women . You are the only person I have ever had this connection with . The only woman I have loved like this . So do n’t you dare throw that shit at me about wanting someone else . Have I ever given you any reason to doubt me ? ”
158171	158175	158176	158176	I	2959	“ Your masseuse , ”
158179	158187	158188	158188	he	2959	“ Was before I fucking met you , ”
158200	158240	158191	158191	I	2959	“ If you do n’t want me , then fine , I ’ll leave . But do n’t let me hold out and try desperately to make things work when you ’re obviously not going to let me in . ”
158247	158264	158265	158265	I	2959	“ Only you can decide if you want this , Emily . Forgiveness is a choice . ”
158269	158290	158265	158265	I	2959	“ Do you want to walk away from me , or do you want to try and make this work ? ”
158297	158300	158301	158301	he	2959	“ Well ? ”
158304	158312	158313	158313	I	2959	“ You know I want to try , ”
158316	158333	158313	158313	I	2959	“ Then stop thinking of the bad shit , and think of the good between us . ”
158334	158339	158377	158377	he	2959	“ I ca n’t . ”
158340	158344	158313	158313	I	2959	“ Why not ? ”
158345	158351	158352	158352	He	2959	“ Because you scare me . ”
158356	158363	158352	158352	He	2959	“ You ’re scared of me ? ”
158364	158367	158368	158368	I	2959	“ Yes . ”
158373	158376	158377	158377	he	2959	“ Baby , ”
158385	158407	158377	158377	he	2959	“ Do n’t be scared of me . Please , do n’t ever be scared of me . I love you . ”
158408	158413	158414	158414	I	2959	“ I ’m trying . ”
158417	158425	158414	158414	I	2959	“ But I ca n’t help it . ”
158440	158484	158414	158414	I	2959	“ I want you to take this weekend to think about us . I was serious about what I said — if you do n’t want to live in New York , we can move . I ’ll resign from my position immediately . ”
158485	158488	158489	158489	I	2959	“ Jameson , ”
158492	158499	158489	158489	I	2959	“ Why would you do that ? ”
158500	158572	158573	158573	I	2959	“ Because I want you to know that you come first to me now . All of this shit — my money , my apartment , my job , New York — it means nothing if I ’m fucking miserable , Emily . And believe me , I am fucking miserable without you . If you want to live in a tent in the back of bumfuck nowhere , we can . ”
158592	158596	158597	158597	I	2959	“ You idiot . ”
158601	158640	158597	158597	I	2959	“ I do n’t want to live in a tent . I love New York . I love you running Miles Media . I would n’t change anything about you . Why would you think that I would ? ”
158641	158743	158597	158597	I	2959	“ Because I ’m a lot to take on , I know that . You said to me once before that to love is to be brave . I need you to be brave , Emily , and move forward from all this . Please think about it . Come back to New York and back to me one hundred percent , and we can start working on a new life together . Holding me at arm ’s distance is n’t the way to navigate this . We wo n’t be able to work it out if we ’re not together . ”
158744	158748	158749	158749	I	2959	“ I know , ”
158752	158762	158763	158763	I	2959	“ Will you think about what you really want ? ”
158767	158772	158763	158763	I	2959	“ Please , Em ? ”
158773	158784	158597	158597	I	2959	“ Yes , okay . I will . I promise . ”
158801	158808	158809	158809	I	2959	“ What are you doing tomorrow ? ”
158812	158815	158809	158809	I	2959	“ Shopping . ”
158816	158827	158763	158763	I	2959	“ Shopping — you ? What are you shopping for ? ”
158828	158842	158843	158843	I	2959	“ Well , where do you get the tents with bathrooms in them ? ”
158846	158850	158851	158851	He	2959	“ Bumfuck nowhere . ”
158880	158947	158948	158948	My	2959	“ Em . . . I ’m not going to speak to you again until I pick you up from the airport on Sunday night . I want you to really think about your future and who you want in it . Either you come back to me with open arms , and we give this a red - hot go , or you end it . ”
158952	158976	158977	158977	I	2959	“ It has to be this way . If I ca n’t have all of you , I would rather be without you . ”
159023	159030	159031	159031	he	2230	“ I ’ll see you then ? ”
159035	159038	159031	159031	he	2230	“ Okay . ”
159039	159044	159045	159045	He	2230	“ I love you . ”
159146	159154	159135	159135	I	2959	“ Are we going to be late ? ”
159159	159174	159135	159135	I	2959	“ No , sir ; we ’re an hour early . Plenty of time . ”
159175	159190	159222	159222	she	186	“ I do n’t want to miss her flight . Go the back way . ”
159191	159198	159199	159199	I	2959	“ You wo n’t . Relax . ”
159352	159358	159359	159359	I	2959	“ You ’ll be here ? ”
159362	159394	159359	159359	I	2959	“ No , I ’ll circle . Let me know when you have her , and I ’ll come back around . You still have fifty minutes before her plane lands . ”
159395	159403	159404	159404	I	2959	“ Yes , yes , I know . ”
159415	159421	159422	159422	I	2959	“ Do I have everything ? ”
159428	159433	159422	159422	I	2959	“ Yes , sir . ”
