4019	4025	4026	4026	He	0	“ I am . . . ”
4030	4033	4034	4034	I	0	“ Gay ? ”
4040	4052	4037	4037	Daniel	0	“ I like women too much to title myself completely gay . ”

4175	4184	4185	4185	Daniel	0	“ So , three of you were straight ? ”
4188	4244	4245	4245	Rebecca	55	“ Maybe it was the sun , maybe it was the alcohol , or maybe it was the cocaine , I do n’t know , but something happened and we got a little randy , spent the weekend in bed , and now I have a bit of a fetish for men on the side . ”
4295	4312	4284	4284	I	0	“ How does it feel to be sexual with somebody that is n’t your natural inclination ? ”
4313	4321	4322	4322	Daniel	0	“ Good . Perhaps a little kinky . ”
4325	4410	4322	4322	Daniel	0	“ I think that ’s what it is for me , I feel like I ’m doing something naughty , something that I should n’t be doing but at the same time feels so natural . And I do n’t know how long I ’ll keep doing it , maybe not forever , maybe not much more at all . But whenever I do it , I do n’t regret it . It does n’t feel wrong , if that ’s what you mean . ”
4411	4417	4418	4418	Rebecca	55	“ How many . . . ”

4497	4537	4538	4538	Daniel	0	“ Well , you said that you have n’t slept with many men . If that ’s a low number for you what ’s a high number ? I mean . . . what are your numbers for women ? ”
4541	4568	4538	4538	Daniel	0	“ Too many to count , I ’m afraid . I meet some beautiful people in my industry , sometimes the temptation is just too great . ”
4587	4596	4597	4597	I	0	“ I wish I was more like you , ”
4600	4603	4597	4597	I	0	“ Meaning ? ”

4687	4696	4697	4697	Daniel	0	“ You do n’t have sex for fun ? ”
4707	4733	4649	4649	I	0	“ I mean , I have in the past . I guess I just got out of the swing of it as I got older . ”
4734	4740	4741	4741	he	0	“ How old are you ? ”
4744	4782	4741	4741	he	0	“ Twenty - seven . I had a few boyfriends in high school and college , and then after that I had a long - term boyfriend . We broke up a year after my parents died . ”
4783	4788	4789	4789	I	0	“ Your parents died ? ”
4808	4821	4822	4822	Rebecca	55	“ They were involved in a head - on collision car crash , ”
4846	4882	4836	4836	Daniel	0	“ My mother died at the scene , my father died on the way to hospital . The driver that hit them had a heart attack and veered onto the wrong side of the road . ”

5023	5050	5051	5051	Daniel	0	“ I have no idea how the two of these girls are genetically related . They have nothing at all in common . Chalk and cheese . ”
5061	5069	5051	5051	Daniel	0	“ Why , what ’s she like ? ”
5070	5073	5074	5074	I	0	“ Beautiful . ”
5079	5084	5085	5085	Rebecca	55	“ Entitled and mean , ”
5092	5151	5088	5088	I	0	“ She ’s not so bad . She ’s taken our parents ’ death the hardest and somehow her personality changed overnight . Brad and I have held each other up and limped along and yet , all she wanted to do is be on her own . She has n’t handled grief the same as we have . ”
5152	5161	5162	5162	Daniel	0	“ You do n’t see her at all ? ”
5165	5173	5174	5174	I	0	“ No , I do see her , ”
5177	5226	5174	5174	I	0	“ I ’m just usually upset or ruffled after she leaves . You know when you spend time with someone and they kind of suck the life out of you . She likes money and fame and having the designer handbags and all her gorgeous boyfriends . I feel like”—I

5338	5372	5335	5335	Rebecca	55	“ She wo n’t spend any money on herself at all and is always saving for a rainy day . She wears the same ten outfits and hides behind those big thick glasses . ”

40963	40990	40956	40956	Joel	302	“ Well , we had to upload a new system into our admin site and to do this we needed to add a new WAP code . ”
41006	41035	40991	40991	Elliot	89	“ What we did n’t realize was , that when we added the new WAP code it was going to completely override the system for the entire building . ”
41036	41044	41045	41045	Elliot	89	“ Why did n’t you realize that ? ”
41054	41078	41051	41051	Joel	302	“ Is n’t it what I pay you for ? An IT expert to stop an impending disaster before it comes to fruition . ”
41106	41127	41099	41099	I	0	“ Do n’t look at Kathryn , look at me . Who specifically out of you three uploaded the system ? ”
41128	41133	41134	41134	I	0	“ I approved it , ”
41137	41145	41146	41146	Elliot	89	“ That ’s not what I asked , ”

41259	41270	41271	41271	I	0	“ Mr. Miles , with all due respect . . . ”
41274	41285	41286	41286	he	89	“ Do . Not . Interrupt . Me . Kathryn , ”
41296	41314	41289	41289	We	818	“ The hourly wages for this building alone are seventy - four thousand , nine hundred pounds . ”
41330	41348	41349	41349	he	89	“ Let ’s multiply that by the three hours that I did n’t have any goddamn internet , ”
41357	41377	41352	41352	Bob	125	“ That ’s two hundred and twenty - four thousand and seven hundred pounds your incompetence has cost me . ”
41384	41396	41397	41397	He	89	“ Would you like me to deduct that from your salary ? ”
41409	41413	41414	41414	he	89	“ Answer me ! ”
41417	41421	41422	41422	we	818	“ No sir , ”
41442	41453	41454	41454	he	89	“ And yet , you have deducted it from mine , ”
41457	41471	41472	41472	He	89	“ Tell me why I should n’t terminate your contracts on the spot . ”
41484	41495	41496	41496	Elliot	89	“ That ’s fine with me , terminate my contract . ”
41510	41543	41544	41544	I	0	“ Oh , you ’d like that , would n’t you ? Run away from your incompetence instead of facing the music . I do n’t know why I would expect better . ”
41549	41558	41559	41559	he	89	“ Do not roll your eyes at me , ”
41585	41598	41571	41571	Christopher	361	“ Elliot , can I see you for a moment , please ? ”
41599	41604	41605	41605	he	89	“ I ’m busy , ”

41638	41645	41646	41646	Joel	302	“ Do n’t you dare resign , ”
41649	41653	41654	41654	Bob	125	“ I agree , ”
41657	41661	41662	41662	I	0	“ Screw this , ”
41666	41686	41662	41662	I	0	“ I ’m sick of his shit , he ’s a fucking asshole . I ’m out of here . ”
41687	41707	41708	41708	Joel	302	“ Calm down , he ’s been like this for years . Why is it suddenly bothering you now ? ”
41722	41735	41736	41736	Bob	125	“ I do n’t know why he ’s going on and on , ”
41739	41750	41736	41736	Bob	125	“ He makes two hundred thousand pounds every ten minutes . ”
41806	41820	41792	41792	Elliot	89	“ This is not to happen again , do I make myself clear ? ”
41821	41824	41825	41828	the three of us	820	“ Yes , ”
41831	41848	41849	41849	He	89	“ I ’m disappointed . When I pay for the best , I expect the best . ”
41869	41877	41878	41878	We	825	“ You may return to your offices . ”
41882	41903	41878	41878	We	825	“ Kathryn , you stay back . I need to see you as regards to the prospectus you sent through . ”
41969	41980	41981	41981	He	302	“ What do you want to discuss about the prospectus ? ”
42020	42032	42033	42033	he	302	“ Do n’t threaten me , I do n’t like it , ”
42037	42044	42033	42033	he	302	“ It was n’t a threat . ”
42045	42061	42033	42033	he	302	“ I keep my professional and private lives separate , I thought you could too . ”
42062	42066	42067	42067	I	0	“ I do . ”
42072	42079	42080	42080	His	302	“ I mean , I am . ”
42085	42117	42080	42080	His	302	“ That ’s a lie . You ’ve never threatened to leave before . In fact , you have stayed to spite me . Suddenly today , you want to resign ? ”
42118	42137	42150	42150	He	302	“ Nobody gets to speak to me like that , whether I ’m sleeping with them or not . ”
42138	42149	42150	42150	He	302	“ We have n’t slept together . . . yet . ”
42155	42166	42150	42150	He	302	“ Although , I ’m rectifying that situation very soon . ”
42204	42214	42215	42215	he	302	“ I leave for New York in the morning , ”
42233	42236	42227	42227	he	302	“ And ? ”

42277	42286	42287	42287	He	302	“ So , I guess that means yes . ”
42292	42299	42300	42300	I	0	“ What ’s with the attitude ? ”
42303	42344	42345	42345	He	302	“ You know , for an intelligent man , you ’re pretty stupid . If you think you roasting me and my work colleagues over an honest mistake is a turn - on , you ’ve got another thing coming . ”
42358	42395	42345	42345	He	302	“ I ’m a professional , Kathryn . I would n’t be who I am if I was n’t . Incompetents wo n’t be tolerated , I do n’t care what my relationship with them is . ”
42409	42423	42396	42396	I	0	“ Do you want preferential treatment — is that what you ’re saying ? ”
42424	42431	42432	42432	I	0	“ No , of course not , ”
42435	42459	42460	42460	I	0	“ Then look at it from my angle , do you want to be treated the same at work or do n’t you ? ”
42472	42479	42480	42480	he	654	“ I can separate the two , ”
42483	42496	42497	42497	He	654	“ The Kathryn I work with and the Kate that I want . ”
42520	42528	42529	42529	he	654	“ Now let ’s talk about Kate , ”
42532	42537	42529	42529	he	654	“ I like her . ”
42567	42572	42560	42560	I	0	“ Let ’s not . ”
43426	43436	43437	43437	I	0	“ Oh really , I ’ll be right there . ”
43445	43466	43437	43437	I	0	“ I have to go . My sister ’s car has broken down and she ’s stranded on the motorway . ”

43527	43536	43537	43537	I	0	“ Do n’t tell anyone I slipped out , ”
43540	43544	43537	43537	I	0	“ Sure thing . ”
43711	43714	43703	43703	I	0	“ Hello . ”

43731	43740	43715	43716	The driver	285	“ Home , take me home . . . ”
43992	43995	43983	43983	he	89	“ Yes ? ”
43999	44005	43996	43996	I	0	“ Why did you leave ? ”
44006	44011	44012	44012	He	89	“ I was tired . ”
44029	44037	44022	44022	he	89	“ What do you want , Elliot ? ”
44038	44045	43996	43996	I	0	“ Are you inviting me in ? ”

44062	44077	44057	44058	this man	89	“ Because it ’s late and like I told you , I ’m tired . ”
44078	44085	43996	43996	I	0	“ We have things to discuss . ”
44086	44100	44057	44058	this man	89	“ No , we do n’t . I ’ve already said my piece . ”
44101	44105	44106	44106	He	89	“ Like hell . ”

44159	44167	44168	44168	I	0	“ What do you want , Elliot ? ”
44181	44188	44176	44176	His	89	“ You know what I want . ”
44189	44197	44198	44198	I	0	“ No , I actually do n’t . ”
44243	44250	44251	44251	he	89	“ The thing is . . . ”
44336	44342	44343	44343	he	89	“ What did I say ? ”
44347	44350	44343	44343	he	89	“ When ? ”
44351	44374	44343	44343	he	89	“ On the second day that we met and you told me that I had blue eyes , what did I say ? ”
44375	44381	44382	44382	I	0	“ I do n’t remember , ”

44512	44533	44534	44534	I	0	“ I get hit on by women a lot . . . and it ’s not because they like me . ”

44555	44579	44580	44580	I	0	“ I deflect flirting all day long , I do n’t even notice that I do it . My brothers are the same . ”
44583	44638	44639	44639	I	0	“ So , when you told me that I have big blue eyes all those years ago — not that I remember you doing it , by the way — I obviously took it that you were hitting on me . . . and I put a stop to it before it carried on . ”
44648	44673	44639	44639	I	0	“ Is that why you ’ve been a bitch to me for all these years ? To show me that you were n’t flirting ? ”
44674	44688	44689	44689	He	884	“ I ’ve been a bitch to you because you ’re an asshole . ”
44702	44709	44710	44710	He	884	“ Well , it ’s true . ”
44722	44733	44710	44710	He	884	“ What are your reservations about doing this with me ? ”
44734	44737	44738	44738	I	0	“ Well . ”

44761	44764	44765	44765	He	884	“ Yeah . ”
44768	44778	44779	44779	I	0	“ I do , I ca n’t explain it . ”
44794	44821	44779	44779	I	0	“ I do n’t know why this happened but it was instantaneous . I saw you dancing in your red netball dress and I got hard . ”
44822	44825	44779	44779	I	0	“ What ? ”
44826	44832	44779	44779	I	0	“ I have a confession . ”

44854	44877	44845	44845	He	884	“ Watch the footage of you dancing in the photocopying room from a month or so ago . . . on repeat . ”
44878	44881	44882	44882	He	884	“ Huh ? ”
44894	44905	44882	44882	He	884	“ Let ’s just say , you rang my bell . ”

45025	45035	44989	44989	He	884	“ Because I ’ve learned not to want more . ”

45040	45082	45083	45083	I	0	“ Because as soon as I openly date someone , it ’s all over the tabloids and whoever I ’m seeing gets hounded by the press over the impending nuptials . Everything we do is scrutinized and splashed over every headline . ”
45086	45099	45100	45100	he	884	“ Do you know how much pressure that puts on a relationship ? ”
45103	45109	45100	45100	he	884	“ I ca n’t imagine . ”
45110	45126	45131	45131	I	0	“ If I sound cold and detached . . . it ’s because I am . ”
45127	45130	45131	45131	I	0	“ Elliot , ”
45152	45212	45135	45135	He	884	“ I decided about six years ago that I was only going to see people in private and not openly date anyone . That way , there ’s no gossip , there ’s no paparazzi stories , it ’s easier for me this way . And I know that it ’s selfish , but it is what it is . ”

45224	45239	45240	45240	I	0	“ I guess I ’ll work that out with her when the time comes . ”

45282	45285	45286	45286	He	884	“ No . ”
45297	45325	45286	45286	He	884	“ You know , I was coming over here to seduce you . . . having a heart - to - heart was n’t on my agenda . ”

45514	45524	45525	45525	I	0	“ You ’ve got to be fucking joking me . ”
45531	45534	45525	45525	I	0	“ Please . ”
45535	45544	45545	45545	I	0	“ But I ’m away for two weeks . ”
45569	45573	45574	45574	He	884	“ I know . ”

45624	45635	45574	45574	He	884	“ What are you going to do in New York ? ”
45636	45648	45649	45649	I	0	“ Jerk off to your netball dress movie , no doubt . ”
45666	45672	45673	45673	He	884	“ Thanks for coming over . ”
45697	45704	45705	45705	he	884	“ I ’m really fucking horny , ”

78751	78785	78741	78741	Christopher	361	“ You know , she ’s not a ship in the night who ’s nearby . You simply decide that you ’re ready to settle down and pick someone to do it with . ”

79141	79206	79138	79138	he	0	“ Yeah , like ten minutes away . That ’s how I first found this area , I came to his house for his son ’s christening . It took me eighteen months to finally find the house I wanted . Well , the land I wanted , the house may go completely yet . But the property is beautiful , three hundred acres . ”

It ’s huge , has ten bedrooms and five living areas as well as what used to be servants ’ quarters ; it used to be a big country estate back in the day . The house is a couple of hundred years old so it needs a lot of work . ”

88528	88532	88508	88510	a city man	1425	” I stand . “
88536	88537	88508	88510	a city man	1425	” “
88542	88550	88551	88551	We	1427	” The girls appear in the kitchen . “
88555	88559	88560	88560	Frederick	187	” Christopher stands . “
88566	88605	88560	88560	Frederick	187	” He kisses Siena and then turns to the redhead ; his hand drops to her behind as he kisses her and I know from his body language that she ’s his favorite . They turn to me . “
88611	88612	88560	88560	Frederick	187	” “
88615	88768	88560	88560	Frederick	187	” I fake a smile . Fuck off already . I want to go . Christopher walks them to the door and I hear the soft giggles of the girls as they say their goodbyes . Not so long ago , this was me : how did this life ever captivate me for so long ? I ’m way past stupid women ; womanizing just does n’t excite me anymore . I know it was fun at the time , but looking back it ’s all a blur . Not one of them ever stood out . Not like her . I get a vision of Kate last night on top of me , the way she looked down at me as she rode me . . . the sheen on her skin , the arousal in her eyes . . . a tingle runs through my body at the mere memory . “
88774	88793	88560	88560	Frederick	187	” Christopher mutters as he walks back into the room . I look up , my fantasy interrupted . “
88796	88797	88560	88560	Frederick	187	” “
88804	88805	88806	88806	I	0	” “
88820	88843	88806	88806	I	0	” I bring the car to a stop outside the front of my house . Christopher and I peer out the window . “
88851	88859	88806	88806	I	0	” he says . All seems silent . “
88862	88870	88806	88806	I	0	” I open the car door slowly . “
88882	88902	88806	88806	I	0	” Christopher says as he climbs out of the car . I look around , the coast seems clear . “
88917	88945	88949	88949	they	1430	” Christopher and I stand on the edge of the gravel driveway . We go around the side of the house and look down toward the lake . “
88953	88969	88970	88970	I	0	” he asks . My eyes roam around the lake , and over the paddocks . “
88977	88992	88970	88970	I	0	” We both turn in a full circle as we search . Completely peaceful . “
89000	89015	89020	89020	EJ	188	” he repeats . With hands on his hips he looks over the valley . “
89022	89026	89020	89020	EJ	188	” he calls . “
89029	89034	89020	89020	EJ	188	” I call back . “
89043	89062	89020	89020	EJ	188	” I look back to see that he is looking over paddocks to the right of the house . “
89065	89079	89020	89020	EJ	188	” He narrows his eyes as he focuses on something in the distance . “
89085	89097	89020	89020	EJ	188	” I walk over and look to where his gaze is . “
89105	89174	89020	89020	EJ	188	” I fall silent . There ’s a huge , black sheep , but it ’s a different kind of sheep , with curly , round horns . We watch as it walks backward , takes a hard run - up and then head - butts the fence post as hard as it can . We hear the bang as it connects ; the sound echoes for miles . “
89181	89185	89020	89020	EJ	188	” I whisper . “
89191	89210	89020	89020	EJ	188	” Christopher frowns as he watches it run back and smash its head as hard as it can . “
89217	89222	89020	89020	EJ	188	” Our eyes meet . “
89229	89272	89020	89020	EJ	188	” I whisper . Suddenly we hear squawks from behind us , and we turn to see the ducks running toward us up the hill , full throttle . Their wings are in the air , beaks open and ready to attack . “
89275	89289	89020	89020	EJ	188	” I cry as I take off in the direction of the house . “
89294	89326	89020	89020	EJ	188	” Christopher cries . I grab the keys from my pocket , the sound of angry ducks coming up close . I look down at the keys on the overcrowded keyring . “
89330	89331	89020	89020	EJ	188	” “
89334	89343	89344	89344	I	0	” Christopher cries as he runs alongside me . “
89353	89354	89344	89344	I	0	” “
89366	89370	89344	89344	I	0	” he cries . “
89379	89404	89344	89344	I	0	” We dive into the car and jump in and slam the doors behind us . The ducks all squawk as they circle us . “
89410	89425	89344	89344	I	0	” Christopher pants as he holds his chest , looking down at our attackers . “
89432	89438	89344	89344	I	0	” I start the car . “
89447	89508	89344	89344	I	0	” We eat lunch , drink some beer , and devise a plan . Two hours later we head back up the driveway . I glance over to see the trusty shovel we bought sitting perfectly on the backseat . I park the car and hand the house keys to Chris . He frowns as he looks through the keys . “
89519	89520	89344	89344	I	0	” “
89539	89543	89533	89533	I	0	” He nods . “

89559	89567	89552	89552	they	1435	” I mutter as I look around . “
89573	89577	89578	89578	I	0	” he asks . “
89593	89594	89578	89578	I	0	” “
89597	89611	89578	89578	I	0	” He goes to get out of the car and then turns back . “

89623	89663	89578	89578	I	0	” I whisper . We all but tiptoe up to the porch , and Christopher quietly begins to try the keys , while I stand with my back to him , shovel in hand . Waiting for the attack . “
89667	89668	89578	89578	I	0	” “
89679	89695	89696	89696	I	0	” he whispers as he fiddles with the lock . I grip my shovel hard . “
89708	89712	89696	89696	I	0	” He chuckles . “

89730	89754	89715	89715	you	1439	” The lock finally gives way and he opens the door . We go in , and I slam the door behind me . “
89759	89769	89770	89770	I	0	” I snap as I march to the kitchen . “
89779	89790	89770	89770	I	0	” I begin to open the drawers in a rush . “
89796	89850	89770	89770	I	0	” I open and shut all the drawers and finally locate it . I speed - read the letter and I get to point three : The ducks will need to be fed their pellets each morning and will become aggressive if hungry . The pellets are kept in the stables . Huh ? “
89856	89865	89866	89866	They	1441	” I look up at Christopher in shock . “
89870	89874	89866	89866	They	1441	” He frowns . “
89882	89883	89875	89875	We	1441	” “

89956	89960	89914	89914	he	1442	“ What for ? ”
89961	89973	89974	89974	I	0	“ To buy fucking duck food , what do you think ? ”

116548	116553	116554	116554	She	113	“ Now , now . ”

116591	116597	116598	116598	she	113	“ Elliot is a dreamer , ”

116841	116889	116890	116890	I	0	“ Elliot hates press , he hates the invasion of his privacy . When they nicknamed him Casanova Miles he was mortified ; he believes that once something becomes the property of the gossip pages , that it ’s no longer special , or belongs to him . ”
116893	116917	116918	116918	I	0	“ He ’s watched Jameson go through very public battles with the media and the ramifications it has caused in his private life . ”

116978	116982	116983	116983	She	1806	“ The irony . ”
116986	117010	116983	116983	She	1806	“ Christopher has filled me in on your and Elliot ’s history , you have n’t always liked each other or gotten along ? ”
117011	117014	117015	117015	She	1806	“ No . ”
117022	117027	117018	117018	she	1806	“ Why is that ? ”
117070	117081	117061	117061	She	1806	“ I hold honesty in the highest regard , Kate . ”
117117	117132	117133	117133	She	1806	“ I thought he was a self - absorbed , self - righteous womanizer . ”

117151	117177	117178	117178	I	0	“ But if you get underneath all that , and not many people get the chance to , he is kind and warm and generous . ”

117223	117226	117258	117258	She	1806	“ Why ? ”
117227	117257	117258	117258	She	1806	“ Because then we would come from the same world and I would n’t have to share him . And he could just be whoever he wanted to be . ”
117287	117297	117282	117282	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , I should n’t have — ”
117298	117305	117306	117306	she	1806	“ That ’s okay , dear , ”

118225	118248	118249	118249	He	89	“ You ’re going to bend over my desk . You ’re going to open up that pretty little pussy for me . ”
118263	118283	118284	118284	He	89	“ And you ’re going to take my cock and then get on your knees and drink me down . ”
118292	118298	118299	118299	he	89	“ Do you understand me ? ”

118839	118840	118810	118810	Elliot	89	” “
118851	118859	118842	118842	I	0	” he whispers as he kisses me . “
118866	119056	118842	118842	I	0	” I took a photo of Elliot outside near his lake the other morning . It ’s from behind , he ’s in a suit , and staring out over his enchanted estate . The ducks are gathered around his feet and the mist is rolling over the hills . It ’s a beautiful shot and I had it framed for him . What do you get the man who has everything ? Now I know . Sentiment . He loves it because it ’s sentimental . It means something to him , just like he means something to me . Being here in New York with his family has given me a little more insight into the mercurial man . He ’s not just difficult with me , he ’s difficult with everyone . And I ca n’t tell you how good that feels to know . It ’s not me , it was never me , it ’s him . We park the car and walk up to the front door ; Elliot knocks as I hold my breath . Tristan opens the door in a rush . “
119059	119078	118842	118842	I	0	” He smiles as he looks at us in turn , bends and kisses me on the cheek . “
119082	119101	118842	118842	I	0	” Elliot takes my hand and we walk into a large living area , a hive of activity . “
119106	119111	119104	119104	Emily	214	” Tristan introduces me , “
119124	119125	119122	119122	James	218	” “
119128	119149	119150	119150	Hi	1450	” The little boy looks to be about three . He has dark hair and blue eyes like his father . “
119152	119164	119150	119150	Hi	1450	” Emily smiles , leans in , and kisses my cheek . “
119170	119176	119150	119150	Hi	1450	” She ’s heavily pregnant . “
119185	119189	119190	119190	She	1829	” She smiles . “
119198	119199	119190	119190	She	1829	” “
119208	119209	119190	119190	She	1829	” “
119219	119223	119190	119190	She	1829	” Tristan smiles . “
119232	119233	119230	119230	Claire	80	” “
119236	119266	119269	119269	Poppy	220	” Claire smiles ; she is n’t at all what I expected . Naturally pretty , with dark hair . He takes a baby dressed in pink from her . “
119289	119302	119306	119306	her	1829	” A bunch of kids go running and screaming through the house . “
119308	119312	119306	119306	her	1829	” he says . “
119320	119324	119306	119306	her	1829	” I giggle . “
119327	119328	119329	119329	Boys	1837	” “
119331	119335	119329	119329	Boys	1837	” he calls . “
119340	119355	119329	119329	Boys	1837	” I look up to see two teenagers and a small boy walking over . “
119368	119369	119363	119363	Harrison	121	” “
119372	119380	119363	119363	Harrison	121	” They all shake my hand politely . “
119386	119387	119363	119363	Harrison	121	” “
119395	119652	119363	119363	Harrison	121	” Tristan smiles as he holds his hand out . I look into the back living - room area to see everyone chatting and laughing , completely relaxed , and I let out a sigh of relief . Maybe this wo n’t be so bad after all . If heaven was a week , this would be it . I put my head on Elliot ’s chest as we ride up to his apartment in the elevator , his strong arm around me , and I feel completely safe and protected . We ’ve danced and laughed , made love and fucked . Spent time with his wonderful family , and to say that Elliot Miles has romanced me around New York is the understatement of the year . In a few days we go home to London , and I never thought I ’d say this , but I do n’t want to . I want to stay here , where we have privacy and Elliot has his brothers , and I have their wives , and we do n’t have to hide under a cloak of secrecy . In London it ’s just us , but here . . . there ’s family . And I know they are n’t mine , but they ’re his , and they ’ve made me feel so welcome . We arrive up at the apartment and Elliot leads me by the hand through to the kitchen , opens the freezer , and removes a silver ice bucket . “
119657	119685	119686	119686	I	0	” I ask . He pulls out two Cornetto ice creams and hands one over ; emotion overwhelms me as I stare at it in his hand . “
119694	119768	119686	119686	I	0	” I stare at him through tears , and I know that if I did n’t already love him before . . . I honestly do now . I watch as he unwraps mine and he passes it over . I take it and wait for him to unwrap his , then he leads me out onto the balcony and we sit down on the day bed . He holds his Cornetto up . “
119773	119784	119686	119686	I	0	” I smile and tap my ice cream with his . “
119789	119815	119686	119686	I	0	” He kisses me tenderly and then licks his ice cream and I could just burst out crying as I watch him . So thoughtful . “
119820	119831	119832	119832	I	0	” he says casually as he licks his ice cream . “
119838	119844	119845	119845	You	0	” I burst out laughing . “
119848	119930	119845	119845	You	0	” ELLIOT I lie in bed and toss and turn . Kate is asleep beside me and it ’s late . My phone beeps with a text and I frown . Who ’s that ? I pick it up and read the message : it ’s from the private investigator that I hired . We found her . What ? I sit up in a rush and walk downstairs to my study , close the door , and dial his number . “
119933	119934	119935	119935	We	1840	” “
119939	119940	119935	119935	We	1840	” “
119945	119946	119943	119943	she	256	” “
119949	119954	119956	119956	she	256	” I smile broadly . “
119962	119963	119956	119956	she	256	” “
119972	119973	119956	119956	she	256	” “
119976	119977	119978	119978	She	256	” “
119985	119986	119978	119978	She	256	” “
119989	119990	119991	119991	She	256	” “
120002	120006	119991	119991	She	256	” I frown . “
120012	120013	120014	120014	I	0	” “
120025	120108	120014	120014	I	0	” I open my computer and wait . The email comes through , my heart drops . A blonde woman , with red lipstick . Beautiful in every way . Someone I already know that I ’m attracted to . I know this woman , I ’ve seen her at auctions before , and I ’ve chased her , knowing deep down that I was supposed to meet her . That something was there . The ballerina . Panic runs through me . “
120122	120126	120014	120014	I	0	” he says . “
120148	120149	120138	120138	I	0	” “
120152	120170	120171	120171	I	0	” I reply as the world spins on its axis . No . . . why now ? “
120179	120180	120171	120171	I	0	” “
120183	120184	120186	120186	sir	0	” “
120188	120237	120186	120186	sir	0	” I hang up and walk back into the bedroom in a daze , my heart beating hard and fast . Is this the sign I ’ve been waiting for ? I climb into bed beside Kate and I take her into my arms as sadness fills me . “
120240	120252	120186	120186	sir	0	” she murmurs in her sleep . I hold her tighter . “
120257	120356	120358	120358	he	1843	” she whispers . I close my eyes in regret . Fuck . I let out a deep exhale as I watch the game on the screen . I ’m at a bar , sitting at a high bench seat near the back , waiting for my brothers . I ’m carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders and fuck , I need to hash it out . I see them amble through the front doors , deep in conversation , and then make their way over to me . Jameson heads straight to the bar . “
120361	120380	120358	120358	he	1843	” Tristan slaps me hard three times on the back as he falls onto the seat beside me . “
120395	120399	120358	120358	he	1843	at”—he glances at his watch—“eleven
120407	120413	120358	120358	he	1843	” I roll my eyes . “
120416	120423	120358	120358	he	1843	” Christopher frowns across the table . “
120428	120429	120430	120430	Destiny	223	” “
120442	120448	120430	120430	Destiny	223	” Tristan raises an eyebrow . “
120456	120472	120430	120430	Destiny	223	” Christopher chuckles as he turns his phone off and puts it on the table . “
120480	120484	120474	120474	you	1845	” I snap . “
120495	120496	120474	120474	you	1845	” “
120501	120506	120510	120511	a clown	1846	” he says dryly . “
120513	120539	120508	120508	you	1845	” Jameson arrives with a tray of beers , places them in front of us and falls into a seat , looks over at me . “

120668	120672	120675	120675	her	84	” Tristan asks . “
120677	120702	120675	120675	her	84	” I take a gulp of my beer ; this story is nothing short of horrifying . They all sit back as they listen . “
120718	120719	120714	120714	he	1847	” “
120724	120728	120729	120730	The ballerina	1849	” Christopher smiles . “

120860	120872	120876	120876	girlfriend	96	” I hold my fingers up and air - quote the word “

120905	120910	120911	120911	I	0	” I correct myself . “

120927	120957	120913	120913	I	0	” Jameson winces . Tristan ’s eyes widen and Christopher puffs air into his cheeks . I look at the three of them as I wait for their reaction . “
120967	120973	120974	120974	You	1853	” Jameson curls his lip . “
120978	120986	120974	120974	You	1853	” Tristan and Christopher nod in agreement . “

121928	121962	121922	121922	You	1829	” We laugh harder , imagining him there with the ferals and bedbugs . Christopher is accustomed to luxury ; he ’d die without it . Jameson ’s attention comes back to me . “
121970	121971	121922	121922	You	1829	” “
121987	121991	121922	121922	You	1829	” I sigh . “
122002	122006	121922	121922	You	1829	” Christopher frowns . “
122011	122018	122019	122019	You	1829	” I stay silent , unsure . “
122030	122034	122019	122019	You	1829	” he snaps . “
122053	122061	122036	122036	she	2396	” My eyes rise to meet his . “
122081	122082	122045	122045	she	2396	” “
122085	122089	122090	122090	I	0	” Tristan says . “
122099	122103	122090	122090	I	0	” Jameson sighs . “
122143	122251	122252	122252	You	1871	” My chest tightens as I look at my brothers and I know that there is no right or wrong answer to this . I ’m fucked if I do , and fucked if I do n’t . Chapter 22 KATE The car pulls to a halt on the tarmac and I look over at Elliot . He ’s pensive and staring out of the window . A million miles away . He ’s been quiet for the last few days ; it must be hard for him to leave his family . The driver takes our luggage from the trunk and carries it onto the plane . “
122255	122271	122272	122272	I	0	” Elliot asks , his voice quiet and monotone . I smile with a nod . “
122275	122292	122293	122293	They	1872	” I lean up to kiss him and he pecks me quickly and opens the door . “
122297	122368	122293	122293	They	1872	” Oh . I exhale ; since when does he care if people are waiting for him ? I take it he ’s not in the mood for kissing , then . He takes my hand and helps me out of the car and then leads me up the stairs and onto the plane . We take our seats and he stares out of the window , deep in thought . “
122382	122386	122293	122293	They	1872	” I smile . “
122391	122395	122396	122398	The Greatest Showman	1873	” he asks . “
122400	122418	122396	122398	The Greatest Showman	1873	” He smiles as if amused and he watches me as he leans back on the headrest . “
122426	122430	122431	122431	I	0	” he asks . “
122436	122443	122431	122431	I	0	” I shrug with a smile . “
122454	122467	122431	122431	I	0	” A frown flashes across his face before he quickly covers it . “
122471	122472	122431	122431	I	0	” “
122481	122482	122431	122431	I	0	” “
122499	122500	122493	122493	I	0	” “
122503	122521	122493	122493	I	0	” He takes my hand in his as the plane begins to take off down the runway . “
122530	122543	122493	122493	I	0	” I pick up his hand and kiss the back of it . “
122556	122560	122547	122547	I	0	” He chuckles . “
122569	122578	122579	122579	El	89	” I put my head on his shoulder . “
122581	122582	122579	122579	El	89	” “
122587	122588	122579	122579	El	89	” “
122608	122612	122613	122613	They	1875	” He nods . “
122616	122626	122613	122613	They	1875	” He falls deep into thought for a moment . “
122646	122650	122641	122641	I	0	” I giggle . “
122664	122665	122661	122662	your mother	2211	” “
122676	122775	122661	122662	your mother	2211	” He stares straight ahead , seemingly falling serious . The plane takes off into the sky and I smile as I stare out of the window . I ca n’t wait to message Ed and discuss the week . I get 10 percent of my information from Elliot , and the other 90 percent of his feelings from Ed . Although , I have to admit , the last two weeks have been a dream come true in Elliot ’s arms . I could n’t ask for a more adoring , tender lover . Fun , too . “
122783	122801	122802	122802	I	0	” I ask . A broad smile crosses his face , the first one of the day . “
122813	122818	122804	122804	they	2206	” My heart swells . “
122824	122830	122804	122804	they	2206	” He raises an eyebrow . “
122844	122853	122804	122804	they	2206	” I drop my head and smile shyly . “
122866	122872	122804	122804	they	2206	” He stares at me . “
122883	122887	122804	122804	they	2206	” I whisper . “
122905	122923	122924	122924	You	1880	” He frowns and drops his head and stares at his shoes . I kiss his shoulder . “
122933	122937	122931	122931	Elliot	89	” I whisper . “
122946	122957	122944	122944	you	1880	” He inhales sharply and sits forward in his seat . “
122963	122994	122958	122958	I	0	” He gets up and takes his briefcase out of the overhead and moves his things to the desk a few rows behind us . I lean around the chairs . “
123003	123016	122958	122958	I	0	” I bat my eyelashes to try and make myself look cute . “
123023	123114	122958	122958	I	0	” he says flatly as he falls into his seat . I chuckle and put my headphones on and click the screen . Mr. Boring Businessman is in town . The plane comes to a halt on the tarmac and I frown : Elliot is still back at his desk working . He has n’t come near me for the entire flight . I mean , I know he had to work , but . . . it was unlike him . He appears beside me and opens the overhead . “
123120	123124	123117	123117	your	1881	” he asks . “
123129	123133	123117	123117	your	1881	” I smile . “
123141	123142	123117	123117	your	1881	” “
123150	123155	123117	123117	your	1881	” He seems stressed . “
123162	123163	123157	123157	I	0	” “
123166	123175	123157	123157	I	0	” He holds his hand out for me . “
123178	123200	123202	123202	Kate	2396	” He thanks the cabin crew and we make our way down the stairs ; Andrew and the Bentley are waiting . “
123204	123216	123202	123202	Kate	2396	” He smiles as he puts our things into the trunk . “
123226	123227	123229	123229	Andrew	0	” “
123231	123235	123229	123229	Andrew	0	” I beam . “
123242	123253	123236	123236	We	1882	” Elliot gets into the car and slams the door . “
123264	123277	123279	123279	sir	0	” Andrew ’s eyes flick up to him in the rearview mirror . “
123281	123288	123279	123279	sir	0	” I frown over at Elliot . “
123297	123301	123295	123295	sweetheart	0	” he whispers . “
123307	123318	123295	123295	sweetheart	0	” He picks up my hand and kisses my fingertips . “
123338	123348	123295	123295	sweetheart	0	” I stare at him : something ’s wrong . “
123353	123506	123295	123295	sweetheart	0	” I whisper . He stares at me as he presses his lips together , as if he ’s stopping himself from saying something . My heart drops . If there ’s one thing I do know about Elliot Miles it ’s that he ca n’t lie . His inability to answer that question just cemented my concerns . Something is wrong . What is it ? Elliot ’s gaze goes outside and with his elbow on the window he watches the world go by . My hand is held tight inside his hand but he ’s not here with me , he ’s miles away . I just do n’t know where . We arrive at my house and Elliot climbs out and retrieves my suitcase . I do n’t want to be here , I want to go to Enchanted to see the girls and check on Gretel the goat . “
123516	123520	123295	123295	sweetheart	0	” he says . “
123526	123560	123563	123563	darling	0	” I cut him off . He stares down at me , and I do n’t know why but I get the feeling he has the weight of the world on his shoulders . “
123565	123583	123563	123563	darling	0	” He kisses me softly . I lean into the kiss and he pulls out of it . “
123588	123651	123563	123563	darling	0	” I nod , and before I can answer he ’s back in the car and the door slams shut . I wheel my suitcase across the street and the car pulls away . I frown as I watch it disappear . What was that about ? I carry my suitcase up the steps and open the front door to the apartment . “
123654	123658	123659	123659	I	0	” I call . “
123663	123670	123659	123659	I	0	” Silence . My shoulders slump . “
123679	125158	125159	125159	You	1891	” I exhale and begin to drag my suitcase up the stairs . Oh well , I suppose some time to myself will do me good . I have n’t done it in so long . I ’ll put a treatment in my hair and a face mask on , get some Uber Eats . I smile as my little room comes into view . One night without Elliot Miles wo n’t kill me . It ’s late and I lie in the darkness . I messaged Ed earlier tonight when I got home but he has n’t yet replied . Elliot has n’t called to say goodnight either . It ’s not like him , he ’s usually so attentive . Weird . Did he have something on ? Was he going somewhere ? I ’ve got this sick feeling in my stomach , like something is wrong but I do n’t know what . I mean , he was a little bit evasive today but surely not enough to warrant this anxiety . Is my gut telling me something ? My phone pings with a notification and I smile . Ed . I jump out of bed and grab my phone and flick the table lamp on . Hi Pinkie , Sorry I have n’t messaged you in a few days . I ’ve been away seeing my family . How are you ? I smile and reply : That ’s okay , I missed you . Tell me about your trip . His reply bounces in . My trip was incredible , Kate came with me and met my family . Although I should have known it was all going too well . I frown . What ? Why , what happened ? I got an email last night , I ’ve finally found the artist that I ’ve been searching for . I smile . Oh my God . He found her . Excitement fills me . This is amazing ! No , it ’s not . She ’s not an old lady as I thought , she ’s young and beautiful . Unattached . I frown . What does that mean ? I read on . I know who she is , I ’ve seen her at auctions and have wanted to chase her before to ask her out . I ’ve always felt like she was someone that I was supposed to meet . I searched for her , even made my brothers follow her once . And now to find that it was her paintings that have been calling me for so long . . . I fear my fate has come to find me when I ’ve finally found someone who makes me happy . No . Wait . . . I read that last message again and my chest constricts . What ? I put my head into my hands ; this ca n’t be happening . No . You believe this woman , the artist , is your fate ? I do n’t want to have regrets . I ca n’t go forward with my life and always regret not going to her and finding out what may have been . This woman has been in my heart long before anyone else . The words blur as tears cloud my vision . What about Kate ? I ’m confused . For the first time in my life , I ’m happy with where I am , who I am with . I feel complete , and yet . . . I ca n’t stop thinking that I have to go to her . To see for myself if this is where I ’m supposed to be . Why now ? Why have I only found her now when I ’ve been searching for her all along ? Why has fate been so cruel to deliver her to me when I care so much for someone else ? I sob out loud . I ’m going to lose him . What should I do , Pinkie ? I slam my computer shut . The lump is big in my throat and painful , and I angrily wipe my tears away . This is n’t happening . Tell me this is n’t fucking happening . I begin to pace , back and forth . What do I write back ? The worst part is , I already know what a friend would say . A friend would tell him that he should go to her , that he should follow his gut feeling and find out if she ’s the one he ’s been searching for all along . That he ’s stupid if he ignores his heart , because it ’s never wrong . How could he ignore this sign and be with another ? But I love him . My chest hurts and I sob out loud . A deep sense of dread fills my every cell . I walk into the bathroom and turn the hot water in the shower on , climb in , and cry . It ’s 3 a.m. I lie in the darkness . A sense of dread is slowly pumping through my veins as if the hope is draining out , and I know that life is n’t fair sometimes . Over the last month I ’ve been happier than I ’ve felt in years . Elliot brought me into his home , shared his farm animals , and showed me what it felt like to be truly cared for . He introduced me to his family and for the first time in a long time , I felt included , as if I were one of them . The thought of not seeing his family again is another dagger to the heart . Elizabeth . I know that I ’m standing on the precipice of heartache , and I ca n’t even begin to understand the depths of the darkness that await me if he goes . I love him . Maybe more than I love myself , because his happiness is what I want above all else . I want him fulfilled , and what good is he to me if his heart is with her ? I get a painful lump in my throat because , deep down , I know the truth . It was always with her . Oh . . . This hurts . The worst part is , I ca n’t even tell him that I know . This stupid fucking game of online chatting we play . . . has come back to haunt me . This is what you get for lying to someone , Kate . I deserve everything I ’m getting and then some . I ’ve deceived Elliot for weeks , and I knew it was wrong and I was going to tell him , but the right time never came around . I thought it was harmless , I now know it ’s not . With a shaky breath I get up and open my computer . I write to Ed . You should follow your heart Ed . A message bounces straight back . Why is he still awake ? I do n’t want to hurt Kate . I screw up my face in tears . Too late . The computer screen is blurred . It ’s your heart that you have to live with , follow it . Kate would want you to be happy . She loves you . Xoxo Hello darkness , my old friend . It ’s been a while since you graced me with your presence , I ca n’t say that I ’ve missed you . I sit at my desk and stare out the window . It ’s 3 p.m. and I have n’t heard from Elliot . I do n’t expect to . A million emotions have run through me : sadness , regret , anger . . . but mostly disappointment . I can see it so clearly now — he and I had fun , but he was always searching for the dream , the fairy - tale ending . And I ’m not talented or special , least of all extraordinary . It was never me . And I hate that for a brief moment I forgot that — it hurts . I remember the love that we made , the laughter we had . The tenderness we shared . It felt so real . Like a fairy tale to me , only better . My eyes fill with tears and I blink them away . Maybe he wo n’t go ? Paul walks past and glances in and then stops in his tracks and comes back . “
125162	125163	125159	125159	You	1891	” “
125166	125179	125159	125159	You	1891	” I fake a smile with a subtle shake of my head . “
125191	125192	125159	125159	You	1891	” “
125200	125201	125159	125159	You	1891	” “
125204	125222	125223	125223	I	0	” I answer way too fast , I do n’t want Elliot to know that I know . “
125239	125240	125235	125235	me	0	” “
125257	125266	125267	125267	I	0	” I smile , grateful for the kindness . “
125276	125527	125528	125528	Babe	107	” It ’s 11 p.m. and I sit at the window and stare out over the street . The house is quiet for the night and my facade has dropped . I went out to dinner with Daniel and Rebecca tonight and had to pretend that everything was great between Elliot and I. I could n’t tell them what I know or how , and I ’ve been lying to them about my Pinkie persona too . This situation is one big fucked - up deception and I deserve to have my heart broken alone . And maybe if Elliot cared enough to want to see me , I would tell him so . But he does n’t . Because he ’s at Enchanted thinking about her . My eyes well with tears and I close them in regret . I hate this , I hate the whole fucking thing . A car comes around the corner and I watch it slowly pull in and park . Elliot gets out . Oh no . Shit . I run and dive into bed , pick up my phone : five missed calls from Elliot . I hear a knock downstairs and then Daniel ’s voice . I pull the blankets up over me and pretend to sleep , my heart racing hard and fast , and I inhale deeply to try and calm myself down . My bedroom door opens and Elliot comes in and sits beside me on the bed . “
125530	125535	125528	125528	Babe	107	” he says softly , “
125540	125560	125586	125586	sweetheart	107	” I roll toward him and he takes my face in his hand and I stare up at him . “
125563	125568	125586	125586	sweetheart	107	” he whispers sadly . “
125571	125577	125586	125586	sweetheart	107	” I force a smile . “
125588	125615	125586	125586	sweetheart	107	” he whispers . My heart constricts . He ’s here to say goodbye . I nod , unable to push a word past my lips . “
125620	125728	125617	125617	I	0	” he asks . I clench my hands into fists ; how am I supposed to do this ? Say goodbye with love when he ’s breaking my fucking heart ? I should be kicking him out , I should be punching him square in the face . I should hate him . He takes his clothes off and climbs in beside me . His lips take mine , and I can feel the heartbreak as it radiates out of him . He ’s right here in hell with me . This is n’t his fault , he ’s a good man . His eyes search mine . “
125735	125739	125617	125617	I	0	” he whispers . “
125743	125765	125766	125766	I	0	” My heart begins to ache and I know this is it , our last dance together ; his silhouette blurs . “
125770	125823	125824	125824	I	0	” We kiss , and my face screws up against his . Do n’t go . For a long time , we kiss , until my heart ca n’t take it anymore . I need this goodbye over . . . I ca n’t do this . I ’m not strong enough . “
125828	126063	126068	126068	sweetheart	107	” I whisper . He crawls over me and slides in deep , his head buried in my shoulder , and I screw up my face as I stare at the ceiling . He moves slowly , carefully , as if I ’m breakable . He always said that he loves me when I ’m vulnerable . Here I am in Imax ; I ’ve never felt so unprotected in my life . Defenseless . His body heats up and he moves slowly to bring himself closer . He spreads his knees and wraps my legs around his hips , but I have no chance of climaxing tonight . How could I possibly feel physical pleasure when I ’m in such pain ? He may as well be stabbing me in the heart , it would feel the same . He holds himself deep and shudders as he comes . His lips run up and down my neck , a tender love song of affection . I stare at the ceiling , lifeless . I feel the hot lone tear roll down my face and into my ear . He rolls off me and falls onto his back , glances over and sees my tears , and throws his forearm over his eyes , as if to shield himself . He ’s unable to deal with me . Or unwilling . After a while , “
126070	126148	126068	126068	sweetheart	107	” he whispers . I stay silent and stare at the ceiling , my heart shattering into a million pieces . Go to hell . The dawn light peeks through the side of the blinds , and I watch him put his suit on from my place in bed . Gone is my tender lover from last night . Elliot Miles is here this morning , and I ’m glad . Because he ’s easier to hate . “
126155	126159	126160	126160	I	0	” I ask . “
126165	126243	126160	126160	I	0	” he says as he pulls his jacket over his shoulders . He ca n’t even look at me . He pats his trouser pockets as he checks he has everything ; I should ask him if I can have my heart back before he leaves . He ’s had it in his possession since the first night we spent together , unashamedly so . His eyes find me across the room and I force a smile . “
126249	126250	126251	126251	I	0	” “
126258	126262	126251	126251	I	0	” he whispers . “
126267	126288	126264	126264	you	0	” We stare at each other and eventually , as if making an internal decision , he closes his eyes . “
126293	126297	126291	126291	Kate	2396	” he murmurs . “
126302	126400	126300	126300	Elliot	89	” He walks over to me and takes my face in his hands and kisses me , and this time it ’s his face that screws up against mine . He knows , he knows that if he does this then we are done . Without one word , he turns and walks out , and the door clicks quietly behind him . I inhale with a shaky breath . He went anyway . Chapter 23 ELLIOT The rain comes down heavy and hard , and I walk on to the plane like it ’s a galley . “
126407	126412	126404	126405	Mr. Miles	51	” The pilot smiles . “
126415	126426	126427	126427	We	1895	” I shake out my umbrella and fold it away . “
126448	126449	126439	126439	I	0	” “
126453	126498	126439	126439	I	0	” I walk through the plane and take my usual seat . Just fucking go , already . My phone lets off a ding and I glance at it . Kate . I open up the message and frown . It ’s a song , “
126501	126568	126569	126570	Mr. Miles	51	” by Loren Allred . Fuck . I drag my hand down my face and eventually , curiosity gets the better of me and I put my headphones on and hit play . It ’s a slow song , of love and loss . I put my head back against the headrest and exhale heavily ; I want this over with . Just fucking go already . “
126572	126577	126569	126570	Mr. Miles	51	” The waiter smiles . “
126591	126595	126586	126587	Miss Boucher	230	” I nod . “

126609	126659	126586	126587	Miss Boucher	230	” I follow him through to the glass atrium ; there are fairy lights strewn across the top of the glass and the table is candlelit . I see her sitting alone at a table for two by the fire . She looks up , and our eyes meet . “
126662	126681	126586	126587	Miss Boucher	230	” She smiles softly . My heart flips in my chest . She ’s absolutely breathtaking . . . “
126684	126698	126586	126587	Miss Boucher	230	” I frown — she makes me nervous — and my stomach flutters . “
126704	126715	126700	126700	I	0	” She smiles up at me with her big eyes . “
126721	126797	126700	126700	I	0	” KATE I sit at the window seat and stare out over the road as the rain comes down . Even the weather is miserable . Like a dark heavy blanket of sadness . I glance at my watch , Elliot will be in France now . I get a vision of the two of them sitting in a romantic location , staring into each other ’s eyes . I ’m in a literal hell . “
126807	126813	126805	126805	ma’am	0	” the waiter interrupts me . “
126816	126827	126805	126805	ma’am	0	” I look down to see my untouched cold dinner . “
126841	126848	126836	126836	I	0	” I pick up my fork . “

126859	126865	126836	126836	I	0	” The waiter smiles hopefully . “
126868	126872	126836	126836	I	0	” I nod . “
126878	126889	126836	126836	I	0	” He raises his eyebrow as he waits for something . “
126894	126898	126836	126836	I	0	” I ask . “

126926	127217	127219	127219	me	0	” He disappears into the kitchen and I take a forkful of pasta into my mouth . Ugh , my stomach rolls and I clench my teeth to stop the gag reflex . I make myself swallow ; food is the very last thing I can handle tonight . I do n’t even want to go home to my roommates , because then I have to pretend that everything is okay . . . or tell another lie , or worse still , tell them the sordid truth . Neither of the tasks I feel capable of while I ’m this weak . I ’ll just wait until everyone goes to bed , it ’s easier that way . It ’s 9 p.m. and . . . in a few hours , I will know . Elliot will either call me . . . or he wo n’t . I know he will . . . he loves me , I know he does and I believe in us . He will call me . He has to . I ’m not in this alone . I have n’t imagined this entire thing . We do have something real . I know we do . I ca n’t be this gullible . I force another mouthful in and my stomach rolls and I heave . I think I ’m going to throw up . One a.m. I walk up my street toward my house in the rain . With two bottles of wine under my belt , I should be happy . What I am is . . . devastated . He ’s with her . I take out my phone and check it for the ten thousandth time tonight . “
127221	127226	127227	127227	You	0	” I whisper angrily . “
127235	127293	127227	127227	You	0	” I screw up my face in tears . Why is this happening ? What on earth did I ever do to deserve such fucking shit in my life ? I lost my parents , my sister is the devil , and now the man that I love . . . does n’t even love me back . “
127296	127302	127227	127227	You	0	” I cry out loud . “
127311	127762	127227	127227	You	0	” I get to my apartment and I ca n’t face going inside , because then I have to sleep . And then it will be morning , and too late to go back on what happened last night . And I will know what he did . I get a vision of Elliot and her waking up in bed and him being all witty and charming and wowing her with his sexuality and her falling madly in love with him . How could she not ? There ’s a lot to love about Elliot Miles . I drop to sit on the bottom step and I stare into space . And as the rain comes down on top of me , wet , afraid , and alone . . . I cry . It ’s the silence that kills you . The things that are n’t said . The closure you never got . Three days . Seventy - two hours . Four thousand , three hundred , and twenty minutes . Too many seconds to count . The clock ticks in my office . It ’s like a megaphone , loud and annoying , reminding me of how time ’s going by . . . with not a word . Not even a text . He ’s with her . I know that now , but that does n’t make it any easier to swallow . I really thought he loved me . My faith in humanity is smashed to smithereens . Did he even care about me at all ? He could n’t have . . . nobody could treat someone that they care about like this . The joke of it is that he does n’t even know that I know what he ’s doing in France . Was that his plan , to just disappear on a business trip and ghost me . . . let me down easy ? Push me to end it with him ? Maybe I ’ll never hear from him again . . . nothing would surprise me any more . It ’s like I ’m grieving a death all over again . I still have n’t told my flatmates . . . I ca n’t . I do n’t feel strong enough to talk about it . . . so I avoid going home . I ’ve been going to the movies , loitering in restaurants . Spending five hours in the gym . I ’ll do anything rather than bring this up and show everyone how weak I really am . I hate myself for being so weak , I thought I was stronger than this . Wednesday . “
127767	127796	127227	127227	You	0	” A soft tap sounds on my office door . I glance up to see Christopher and I instantly get a lump in my throat . Go away . “
127801	127821	127227	127227	You	0	” he asks softly . No . I force a smile and gesture to the seat at my desk . “
127824	127845	127227	127227	You	0	” He sits down and leans back and crosses his legs ; his eyes hold mine . He knows something . “
127850	127854	127227	127227	You	0	” I ask . “
127861	127878	127227	127227	You	0	” he asks , his voice soft , cajoling . I press my lips together hard . “

127919	127930	127890	127890	you	1900	” I turn back to my computer and act busy . “
127946	127981	127938	127938	he	89	” He stays silent , so silent that I look back . His eyes hold mine , and I know that he knows just how broken I am . My eyes well with tears . “

128061	128066	128067	128067	Kate	2396	” His face falls . “

128160	128165	128166	128166	I	0	” I snap sharply . “

128231	128244	128245	128245	Mom	52	” He leans his face on his hand as he watches me . “
128249	128273	128245	128245	Mom	52	” That makes two of us . I nod , unable to push out words in fear of a full - on meltdown . “
128281	128300	128275	128275	I	0	” he asks as he looks around my office . I smile sadly , Christopher is so kind . “

128363	128378	128360	128360	he	1903	” He cuts himself off as if reconsidering what he was going to say . “
128381	128382	128383	128383	He	1903	” “
128388	128389	128383	128383	He	1903	” “

128530	128558	128466	128469	a pretty cool chick	0	” He puts his hands in his expensive suit pockets , and his eyes hold mine . I reach up onto my toes and kiss his cheek . “

128599	128826	128827	128827	Baby	90	” I lie in the darkness in my bed ; the world is a dark and lonely place . I feel like this hurt is just going on and on . I opened up and told Daniel and Rebecca everything tonight and it ’s torn down the last of my defenses . Now that I do n’t have to act brave , I ’m falling apart . I ca n’t stop crying . Howling - to - the - moon heartbreak , where he ’s not coming back and I feel like my whole future has been snatched from my grasp . The life I saw us having , living at Enchanted , his animals , the laughing and loving , his family . . . all gone . My eyes are red and swollen and I ’ve taken three showers tonight to try and make me feel better . I ’m sobbing , my chest wracked , and for the life of me , I ca n’t stop it . To the point that I think I ’m going to have to take a sleeping tablet or something to calm myself down . I remember this kind of grief all too well . I feel the bed dip and Daniel crawls in behind me ; he ’s wearing boxer shorts and is bare - chested . “
128829	128838	128839	128839	I	0	” he whispers as he pulls me close . “
128843	128894	128839	128839	I	0	” I murmur . He tightens his grip and I close my eyes , grateful for the warmth . For a long time , he holds me as I cry , and every now and then he pushes the hair back from my forehead as he looks down at me . “
128903	128914	128915	128915	You	1907	” he whispers , his body snug up against mine . “
128919	128985	128915	128915	You	1907	” He wipes my tears and holds me . He ’s warm and big and a closeness runs between us . My head is on his chest and his arms are tight around me ; he kisses my temple and I feel something move down below . I frown . He holds me closer and I feel it again . What ? He ’s hard . “
128994	129007	128992	128992	baby	2372	” he whispers . I stare up at him in the darkness . “
129019	129071	128992	128992	baby	2372	” I frown again and he takes my hand and runs it down over his rippled abs , and lower into his shorts . We stare at each other , my breath catches , and I feel his pubic hair and then hard cock ; my hand closes around it instinctively . “
129077	129119	128992	128992	baby	2372	” he whispers . He kisses me softly and I screw up my face against his . He kisses me again and rolls me onto my back as he leans over me , and I feel his body up against mine . “
129122	129126	129127	129127	Daniel	0	” I whisper . “
129131	129148	129127	129127	Daniel	0	” I sit up in a rush and pull away from him . What the hell ? “
129166	129173	129160	129160	mine	0	” I stammer in a panic . “
129179	129180	129181	129181	He	89	” “
129205	129214	129197	129197	They	1910	” I wince as I get a visual . “
129222	129226	129197	129197	They	1910	” he whispers . “
129235	129236	129227	129227	You	0	” “
129243	129244	129227	129227	You	0	” “
129252	129267	129268	129268	I	0	” He gets out of my bed and puts his hands on his hips . “
129275	129288	129289	129289	I	0	” I turn my back to him and stare at the wall . “
129292	129302	129303	129303	I	0	” He sits on the chair in the corner . “
129310	129814	129815	129815	Kate	2396	” I nod , grateful that he is n’t leaving but he ’s out of my bed . I would have never forgiven myself . . . not that it matters to anyone anyway , I guess . But I would know . I was n’t lying — my body belongs to Elliot , whether he wants it or not . I sip my coffee in a crowded café on a Sunday morning . I got up early and went to the gym ; I have a chocolate muffin in front of me and I ’m feeling a little better today . I had a talk with Daniel and I believe him , he was just trying to be of comfort . And maybe on some level I should have done it , maybe it would have helped me to move on and forget him . I hear the familiar ding of my phone and my blood runs cold . Ed . I ignore it for a moment , and it dings again . I do n’t want to talk to Ed , because I know he ’s going to tell me about her . I ’m cutting ties with him too . I ’m sick of all the fucking lies . No more charades , it ’s obvious I ca n’t handle this game . It dings again and I close my eyes . Go away . With a shaky hand I lift my coffee to my mouth . It dings again . Fuck it . May as well get this over with . . . I take out my phone and click on his message . Hi Pinkie , Sorry I have n’t been in touch , I ’ve been busy . I ’ve missed you . His sweet words open it all back up , emotion overwhelms me , and the tears I so gallantly told myself that I no longer had , appear once more . I go to type but everything is blurred so I put my phone down on the table and angrily swipe them away . No , I have to know . I type : How is your artist ? A reply bounces back . I do n’t care . I frown and write : Why ? Because , she ’s not you . What ? What are you talking about ? I love you . . . Pinkie . . . or should I say , Kate . My eyes widen and I sit back in my chair — what the hell is going on here ? Are you going to eat that chocolate muffin , or will I ? I look up and Elliot is sitting at a table across the café ; his eyes search mine as he gives me a soft smile . And something snaps inside of me and I ’m furious and I hate him , so I stand and march out of the café and down the street . “
129817	129826	129827	129827	Kate	2396	” he calls as he runs after me . “
129833	129876	129877	129877	Kate	2396	” I do n’t want to hear his lies , I do n’t want to be anywhere near him . I walk quickly across the road to the park , needing to get as far away from him as I possibly can . “
129879	129897	129898	129898	Kate	2396	” I can hear his voice getting closer . I get to the park and I run . “
129900	129908	129909	129909	Kathryn	2396	” he cries as he takes chase . “
129913	129928	129909	129909	Kathryn	2396	” He grabs my arm and I turn and take a swing at him . “
129934	129958	129959	129959	I	0	” I scream like a maniac through tears . He pants as he tries to catch his breath ; his eyes are wide . “

129974	129978	129967	129967	you	2396	” I cry . “

130029	130039	130005	130005	you	2396	” He pauses as if choosing his words carefully . “
130045	130046	130005	130005	you	2396	” “
130062	130077	130058	130058	you	2396	” I cry . His chest rises and falls as he gasps for breath . “
130089	130094	130095	130095	You	2396	” His shoulders slump . “
130106	130118	130104	130104	Elliot	89	” I whisper through tears as I take a step back . “
130142	130151	130139	130140	the singer	1914	” I screw up my face in tears . “

130217	130237	130238	130238	I	0	” He dives for me and holds me against my will as I struggle to get away from him . “

130257	130267	130238	130238	I	0	” We struggle as he tries to hold me . “

130329	130333	130327	130327	yours	2396	” I sneer . “
130360	130384	130385	130385	I	0	” We stare at each other , me in full - blown tears and him with flared nostrils as he battles for control . “
130392	130415	130385	130385	I	0	” We hear the click of a camera and we both turn to see a photographer taking photos of the whole thing . “
130420	130510	130385	130385	I	0	” Elliot growls . Oh no . The guy with the camera begins to run and Elliot chases him . He wrestles him to the ground and people around them scream . Elliot snatches the camera from him and smashes it into a million pieces . The photographer gives him a mouthful and goes to stand and Elliot punches him hard in the face . He punches him again , and again . What the hell is going on ? I turn , and I run . Chapter 24 ELLIOT “
130524	130547	130548	130548	I	0	” the police officer says as he writes something on his pad . I clench my jaw as I stare at him . “

132388	132554	132360	132360	I	0	” He stops the car and I get out and slam the door hard , and march inside . Fuck this day . KATE I sit on the couch with Daniel and Rebecca , horrified as we watch the news . In breaking news , Elliot Miles , CEO of Miles Media , has been arrested and charged with assault and criminal damage after an altercation with a photographer this afternoon in Battersea Park . Mr. Miles , who appeared to be in some kind of domestic incident with a mystery woman , turned on a bystander when he was being photographed . He was apprehended and arrested at the scene . The footage goes to Elliot holding me against my will and I ’m screaming at him to let me go , then he turns and we see the photographer , and Elliot begins to chase him as he runs away . I put my hand over my mouth as I watch in horror . “
132563	132646	132360	132360	I	0	” I already knew it was bad . . . but it looks even worse . Elliot catches him , breaks his camera and then the man says something to Elliot who then proceeds to beat him . I can be seen in the footage running away from the scene . Daniel ’s horrified eyes find mine . I stay silent . My phone buzzes on the coffee table and the name Elliot lights up the screen . Tears fill my eyes . “
132652	132665	132667	132667	he	1956	” Daniel demands ; he reaches down and turns my phone off . “
132671	132672	132667	132667	he	1956	” “

132707	132748	132749	132749	He	1956	” Daniel says . I roll my eyes . I ca n’t imagine how dead Daniel would be if Elliot ever found out what happened last night between us in the darkness . Not that I care , of course . “
132752	132839	132840	132840	Kate	2396	” I lie on my bed in the darkness ; my phone has been off all night . He ca n’t be still arrested , he called me . What if I was his one phone call and I did n’t answer ? Stop it , stop thinking of him . He does n’t think of you . I turn my phone on . Twenty - six missed calls . . . Elliot . I close my eyes in regret and switch my phone back off . “
132842	132850	132840	132840	Kate	2396	” I hear Daniel call from downstairs . “
132859	132860	132851	132851	I	0	” “

132875	133104	132851	132851	I	0	” I drag myself out of bed and walk downstairs to see Daniel still watching the news . In a breaking news update , the mystery woman involved in the domestic incident today with Elliot Miles has been confirmed as Kate Landon , until recently an employee of Miles Media . It has been alleged that Elliot Miles is involved in a sordid love triangle with Kate Landon and her partner , Daniel Stevens . Landon , who lives with Stevens , was photographed with Miles in New York last week but has since returned to her home and partner . It is thought that Mr. Miles is upset with her returning to her partner , thus the altercation this afternoon in Battersea Park . It flicks to photographs of me and Daniel holding hands and Daniel with his arm around me . A few of us arriving at various balls in different locations , each one strategically shot so that it looks like Daniel and I are together . Then there are photos of me and Elliot in New York together last week , holding hands as we walked out of a restaurant . Another where he is kissing me in the car . Another of us in a shop and Elliot buying me lingerie . Another shot of me with Elizabeth Miles at our lunch date . “
133108	133114	132851	132851	I	0	” Daniel whispers in horror . “
133119	133141	132851	132851	I	0	” I put my hands over my mouth . It goes to a shot of our house . Our eyes meet . “
133153	133168	133149	133149	they	1959	” He slowly gets up and walks to the window and his face falls . “
133171	133172	133149	133149	they	1959	” “
133175	133210	133212	133213	my God	646	” I run over and peer through the curtains to see a sea of photographers all set up on the pathway opposite our apartment . Cameras facing the house , waiting for their shot . “
133215	133224	133212	133213	my God	646	” I put my head into my hands . “
133236	133243	133245	133245	him	646	” He hands me his phone . “
133272	133277	133278	133278	I	0	” I exhale heavily . “

133356	133428	133349	133349	he	646	” I trudge up the stairs and pick up my phone , turn it on . Thirty - six missed calls from Elliot . I sit on the bed and hold the phone in my hands . I really do n’t want to call him . What is there to say ? My phone rings in my hand , causing me to jump and fumble with it . It ’s him . “
133431	133435	133436	133436	Kate	2396	” I answer . “
133442	133459	133460	133460	I	0	” His voice is soft , cautious . I stay silent , unsure what to say . “

134521	134539	134540	134540	You	2396	” I tell her in frustration . Rebecca scratches her head as she looks at us both . “
134543	134544	134540	134540	You	2396	” “
134547	134554	134540	134540	You	2396	” we both cry in unison . “
134557	134561	134540	134540	You	2396	” She frowns . “
134569	134575	134540	134540	You	2396	” Daniel shakes his head . “
134581	134585	134540	134540	You	2396	” he snaps . “
134603	134628	134596	134596	I	0	” She walks into her room and closes the door . I run up the stairs to pack my suitcase and Daniel follows me . “
134636	134637	134638	134638	I	0	” “
134643	134779	134638	134638	I	0	” I throw my suitcase onto the bed ; I already know what I ’m doing but I do n’t want to tell Daniel just yet , not until it ’s done . This is my decision , and mine alone ; I do n’t want anyone to cloud my judgment . After Daniel and I crossed the friendship line last night , I know I have to think on my own from here on in . I begin to pack clothes into my suitcase at speed , run into the bathroom and pack my toiletries . I throw in my shampoo and conditioner , hairdryer . I put my hands on my hips as I look around . I take my framed photographs of me and my parents and put them in my suitcase . “
134787	134791	134638	134638	I	0	” He frowns . “
134797	134803	134638	134638	I	0	” His eyes are wide . “
134810	134811	134812	134812	I	0	” “
134844	134845	134840	134840	I	0	” “
134848	134849	134840	134840	I	0	” “
134855	134859	134860	134860	I	0	” I ask . “
134863	134868	134860	134860	I	0	” He frowns again . “
134886	134887	134873	134873	I	0	” “
134890	134896	134897	134897	I	0	” My eyes hold his . “
134907	134908	134897	134897	I	0	” “
134911	134922	134897	134897	I	0	” He smiles as he puts his arms around me . “
134929	134940	134897	134897	I	0	” My eyes search his and he cups my face . “
134951	134955	134956	134956	He	0	” he whispers . “
134962	134963	134964	134964	He	0	” “
134968	134974	134975	134975	I	0	” I drop my head . “
134978	135028	135029	135029	He	0	” My phone beeps with a text . Kate , it ’s Andrew . I ’m coming around the corner now . Stay inside until I come to the door to get you . Ask Daniel to stay out of sight . I text back : Okay , thanks . “
135044	135045	135034	135034	he	0	” “
135057	135063	135067	135067	babe	0	” His eyes hold mine . “
135069	135074	135067	135067	babe	0	” He hugs me . “
135090	135094	135067	135067	babe	0	” I ask . “
135101	135102	135067	135067	babe	0	” “
135105	135240	135242	135242	Kathryn	2396	” With one last look he disappears down the stairs . A sense of urgency fills me and I quickly text Brad . Are you home ? Can I get some things dropped at your house ? A reply bounces back . Yeah sure , I ’ve been waiting for you to call . I ’ve seen the news . What the fuck is going on , Kate ? I shake my head . A whole lot of lies , I ’m fine . Fill you in tomorrow . Love you . X A reply bounces back . Love you too , see you soon . X Ten minutes later I hear a knock on the front door and I open it . Andrew smiles and walks in and closes the door behind him . “
135244	135245	135242	135242	Kathryn	2396	” “
135248	135249	135242	135242	Kathryn	2396	” “
135254	135258	135259	135259	I	0	” I nod . “
135265	135270	135271	135271	They	1984	” My face falls . “
135336	135343	135322	135322	We	1986	” Nerves dance in my stomach . “
135346	135350	135322	135322	We	1986	” I whisper . “
135360	135361	135322	135322	We	1986	” “
135364	135365	135322	135322	We	1986	” “
135370	135414	135322	135322	We	1986	” I run up the stairs and whizz through my closet at full speed . My heart is hammering , I feel like I ’m about to rob a bank or something . I put on my big jacket and walk back downstairs . “
135417	135439	135322	135322	We	1986	” Andrew gives me a kind smile and lifts my hood up over my head — my scared eyes hold his . “
135462	135463	135464	135464	I	0	” “
135476	135477	135481	135481	dear	0	” “
135483	135508	135478	135478	I	0	” He takes my hand and opens the door just a little ; two huge security guards stand at the edge of my porch . “
135511	135515	135478	135478	I	0	” he calls . “
135518	135560	135478	135478	I	0	” They spread their legs wide as if preparing for battle . Andrew opens the door and puts a black umbrella up , facing it toward the paparazzi who are running across the street , effectively blocking their view of me . “
135563	135574	135478	135478	I	0	” he snaps . He pulls me by the hand . “
135580	135581	135582	135582	Kate	2396	” “
135584	135596	135597	135598	Miss Landon	107	” I hear them all cry as they clamber around us . “
135605	135622	135597	135598	Miss Landon	107	” A million questions are being screamed as I am whisked at speed along the pavement . “
135626	135663	135597	135598	Miss Landon	107	” one of the security guards yells . He pushes a photographer hard in the chest and he falls onto his backside . I begin to get jostled from side to side as they close in . “
135666	135728	135729	135729	You	1990	” Andrew yells . My heart is hammering in my chest , and we make it to the car and I dive into the backseat . Andrew climbs in behind me and the door slams shut . The photographers all surround the car as they yell out to me , and the security guards jump in and one begins to drive . “
135736	135791	135729	135729	You	1990	” I cry . He does n’t reply , and he does n’t stop . He just drives straight through the middle of them and somehow , they part and let us through . I look back at my apartment and sadness fills me ; how the hell is Daniel going to get out ? “
135805	135809	135801	135801	Daniel	0	” Andrew nods . “
135815	135826	135801	135801	Daniel	0	” I wring my hands together nervously on my lap . “
135846	135847	135841	135842	my brother	361	” “
135853	135951	135841	135842	my brother	361	” I nod as adrenaline surges through my body like a freight train . We fly through the streets of London and , for the first time , I understand why Elliot guards his privacy so stringently . Why he does n’t give them an inch to work with . This is an absolute fucking nightmare . We drive into the underground parking lot at Elliot ’s luxury apartment ; the security gates close behind us and the car pulls up in front of the elevator . The guard parks the car and we all get out . “
135955	135968	135969	135969	I	0	” I whisper . The burly guards walk over to the elevator . “
135975	135986	135969	135969	I	0	” The guards ignore me and walk into the elevator . “
135992	136003	135969	135969	I	0	” I ask as I look at them in turn . “
136017	136156	136014	136015	Miss Landon	107	” I stare at them and Daniel ’s words from when I first met Elliot Miles come back to me : he ’s a powerful man and not someone I would mess with . Suddenly I ’m very aware that if Elliot Miles wants me delivered in person , I no longer have a choice . If I told them that I was n’t going up to his apartment right now , they would make me go , regardless . A million things are running at full speed through my head , but the blazing emotion is . . . loss of control . We ride to the top floor in silence and the doors open into Elliot ’s foyer , where he ’s waiting . His eyes find mine and he smiles softly , as if relieved . “
136160	136232	136233	136233	I	0	” he says to the guards ; he opens the door to his apartment and I walk in . I stand in the middle of his living room , determined to be strong . This man has brought me to my knees for the last time . Elliot ’s eyes hold mine and he stares at me as if I ’m a wild animal , about to run at any moment . “
136239	136246	136233	136233	I	0	” he whispers . I nod . “
136258	136259	136248	136248	I	0	” “
136262	136275	136248	136248	I	0	” He puffs air into his cheeks as if lost for words . “
136283	136308	136314	136314	sweetheart	0	” My eyes hold his and I just want to hurt him , for hurting me . For putting me through this fucking bullshit . “
136316	136320	136314	136314	sweetheart	0	” he whispers . “
136328	136332	136326	136326	Elliot	89	” I yell , “
136374	136379	136380	136380	I	0	” His face falls . “
136394	136400	136401	136401	You	0	” I stare at him . “
136407	136411	136401	136401	You	0	” he cries . “
136426	136427	136428	136428	I	0	” “
136436	136450	136428	136428	I	0	” I scream . He clenches his jaw , unsure what to say . “
136469	136470	136471	136471	You	0	” “
136486	136490	136479	136479	you	0	” he says . “
136499	136500	136491	136491	I	0	” “
136504	136511	136512	136512	You	0	” I throw up my hands . “
136538	136543	136528	136528	You	0	” My face falls . “
136577	136582	136573	136573	Edgar	99	” he replies calmly . “
136591	136592	136594	136594	she	56	” “
136614	136615	136609	136609	She	56	” “
136625	136626	136620	136620	you	56	” “
136656	136657	136644	136644	I	0	” “
136665	136671	136659	136659	you	56	” I yell in outrage . “
136680	136681	136659	136659	you	56	” “
136691	136695	136659	136659	you	56	” he cries . “
136702	136731	136659	136659	you	56	” I drop my head , this is pointless . I sit on the couch and he falls to the floor on his knees in front of me . “
136746	136756	136757	136757	Kate	2396	” My eyes hold his . Is that true ? “
136759	136764	136757	136757	Kate	2396	” He sighs sadly . “
136786	136787	136788	136788	I	0	” “
136795	136810	136788	136788	I	0	” I pause as I try to get the wording right in my head . “
136818	136819	136788	136788	I	0	” “
136840	136857	136827	136827	she	56	” I swallow the lump in my throat . Do I even want to hear this ? “
136869	136873	136867	136867	you	56	” he whispers . “
136938	136948	136928	136928	I	0	” I drop my head ; do n’t cry . “
136960	136966	136967	136967	I	0	” His eyes search mine . “
136972	136973	136967	136967	I	0	” “
136979	136983	136967	136967	I	0	” I interrupt . “
136999	137000	136991	136991	Elliot	89	” “
137005	137006	136991	136991	Elliot	89	” “
137013	137018	136991	136991	Elliot	89	” He exhales heavily . “
137026	137027	136991	136991	Elliot	89	” “
137042	137046	137047	137047	I	0	” I ask . “
137062	137063	137056	137056	I	0	” “
137077	137084	137085	137085	I	0	” I cry , still outraged . “
137090	137101	137104	137104	yours	0	” he yells as he holds his hands out wide . “
137108	137112	137106	137106	Kate	2396	” Are you ? “
137120	137124	137113	137113	I	0	” he continues . “
137132	137151	137125	137125	I	0	” My eyes rise to his and the hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention . “
137155	137156	137125	137125	I	0	” “
137160	137161	137162	137162	You	0	” “
137175	137196	137197	137197	I	0	” He inhales sharply and I know I hit the nail on the head . My eyes well with tears . “
137206	137210	137204	137204	Elliot	89	” I whisper . “
137216	137220	137213	137213	you	0	” He stands . “
137248	137269	137270	137270	Kate	2396	” Oh . . . this man hurts me . I drop my head , unable to look at him . “
137279	137300	137270	137270	Kate	2396	” He takes my face in his hand and he dusts his thumb back and forth over my bottom lip . “
137330	137364	137321	137321	You	2396	” My heart drops . Never once . I force a nod ; I just want this conversation over . He falls to his knees in front of me again and looks up . “
137369	137375	137376	137376	We	2008	” He kisses me softly . “
137407	137418	137405	137405	Kate	2396	” More lies . I pull back from his kiss . “
137424	137435	137405	137405	Kate	2396	” He smiles as he holds me in his arms . “
137444	137445	137446	137446	Elliot	89	” “
137470	137471	137462	137462	we	2008	” “
137474	137485	137486	137486	You	2396	” He nods as he pulls me to my feet . “
137499	137558	137486	137486	You	2396	” He leads me into the bathroom and turns the shower on . He slowly undresses me and I get in under the water . I shower in a daze , somewhere between heartache and relief . Now , I know . I get out and he dries me with a towel as he showers me in kisses . “
137566	137570	137562	137562	you	2396	” he whispers . “
137577	137663	137666	137666	babe	0	” I stare at him in a detached state : is he for real ? He thinks he can say a few pretty words and all is well between us ? I feel nothing . . . I ’m dead inside . It ’s like I ’m talking to a stranger , one that I do n’t even like . Whatever we had is gone . We get into his bed and our lips touch ; his kiss deepens and I pull out of it . “
137668	137672	137666	137666	babe	0	” I whisper . “
137690	137691	137683	137683	I	0	” “
137694	137721	137722	137722	I	0	” He reaches over and turns the bedside light off and snuggles in behind me , his arms around me , his lips at my temple . “
137728	137732	137726	137726	Kate	2396	” he whispers . “
137738	137856	137857	137857	Kate	2396	” I whisper back . We lie in the darkness , so physically close and yet I ’ve never felt so alone . If he knew me at all , he would know that . A tear rolls down my face in the darkness ; it ’s hot and salty and feels a lot like betrayal . Elliot Miles is n’t the only one who wanted a fairy - tale ending . I did too . And sadly , I know this is n’t it . Chapter 25 ELLIOT I wake with a start , a bang in the distance . I look over to Kate , but I ’m in bed alone . I sit up . “
137859	137869	137870	137870	Kate	2396	” I call . Is she in the bathroom ? “
137872	137897	137898	137898	Kate	2396	” I get up and walk to the bathroom , it ’s empty . Panic floods through me and I flick the light on . “
137900	137908	137898	137898	Kate	2396	” I yell as I look around . “
137913	137921	137922	137922	Kate	2396	” I march into the living room . “
137924	137930	137931	137931	Kathryn	2396	” I cry with urgency . “
137933	138003	138005	138005	sir	2396	” I look around , where ’s her handbag ? Her bag is gone . No . I run from room to room , screaming her name as my heart races . She ’s not here . I dial her number , it rings out . I dial it again and it ’s switched off . Anger surges through me and I kick the wall . I dial security . “
138007	138008	138005	138005	sir	2396	” “
138013	138017	138022	138022	she	2396	” I growl . “
138033	138034	138031	138031	she	2396	” “
138051	138055	138044	138044	she	2396	” I yell . “
138072	138073	138074	138074	You	2396	” “
138079	138083	138085	138085	her	2396	” I cry . “
138087	138122	138123	138123	Kate	2396	” I hang up and begin to pace back and forth , my chest rising and falling as I grapple for control . I go to the window and look down over the street . “
138125	138129	138123	138123	Kate	2396	” I whisper . “
138134	138188	138193	138193	sir	0	” I sit in the back of the car and dial Kate ’s number ; it goes straight to voicemail . I inhale sharply — I’ve searched for her all night . She simply disappeared into thin air . Not a trace . She has n’t gone home , her phone is off . “
138195	138200	138193	138193	sir	0	” I peer in . “
138205	138206	138193	138193	sir	0	” “
138226	138261	138216	138216	We	2017	” I get out of the car and march up to the front door , knock hard , and it opens in a rush . A young man comes into view , early thirties . “
138269	138270	138266	138267	Elliot Miles	89	” “
138277	138278	138266	138267	Elliot Miles	89	” “
138284	138285	138286	138286	She	2396	” “

138466	138493	138499	138499	man	1236	” The earth spins on its axis . My nostrils flare as I battle for control . He shakes his head , with a deep exhale . “
138506	138513	138516	138516	she	2396	” He glances at his watch . “
138521	138525	138516	138516	she	2396	” I demand . “
138538	138550	138531	138531	she	2396	” My eyes widen , her plane has n’t left yet . “

138608	138643	138581	138581	She	2396	” I cry . Andrew pulls out into the traffic with speed and I dial Kate ’s number . Ring , ring . . . ring , ring . . . ring , ring . “
138653	138750	138581	138581	She	2396	” I whisper . It rings out and I dial her number again . I imagine her staring at her phone ignoring my call and my fury begins to boil . At her , at me . . . at this entire fucked - up situation . Why did she run out in the middle of the night , what was she thinking ? When this is all over , I ’m going to kill her . . . that ’s if I do n’t have a heart attack beforehand . I peer through the windshield . “

138759	138796	138756	138756	I	0	” Andrew huffs as he changes lane , then he changes lane again and I dial Kate ’s number with my heart in my throat . Please pick up , baby . It rings out again . “
138804	138833	138802	138802	Kathryn	2396	” I yell as I hit my phone on the back of the seat in anger . Andrew ’s eyes flick up to mine in the rearview mirror . “
138839	138892	138802	138802	Kathryn	2396	” I growl . He puts his foot down and we fly through the traffic , and half an hour later we pull up at the airport . I dive out of the backseat and run in , my eyes scanning the check - in lines as I turn in a 360 . “
138897	138903	138904	138904	Kate	2396	” I whisper to myself . “
138906	138926	138904	138904	Kate	2396	” I begin to panic that I ’m not going to find her , there are too many people . “
138934	138983	138904	138904	Kate	2396	” I run along the back of the check - in queues as I search for her . I get to one end and run back to where I began : perhaps she ’s already gone through . I run to the security checkpoint and stand in line . “
138990	139064	138904	138904	Kate	2396	” I mutter . I look around the line to the security guards , working at a snail ’s pace . Hurry the fuck up . I run my hands through my hair in a complete panic . Every minute that ticks past . . . is a minute I ’ve lost to stop her . Finally I get to the checkpoint and walk through the scanner , and it dings . Fuck . “

139138	139203	139069	139069	sir	0	” I pick up my belongings and tuck them under my arm and I run as fast as I can , until I get to an intersection . Six huge corridors go in different directions leading to the departure gates . No . I swallow the lump in my throat as I look at my options : what way should I go ? Umm . “
139207	139217	139069	139069	sir	0	” I ’m panting as I gasp for breath . “

139294	139308	139309	139309	Kate	2396	” She does n’t hear me and she goes through the double doors . “
139311	139344	139309	139309	Kate	2396	” I yell as loud as I can . People turn and stare and I get to the flight attendants who are doing the check - in . I gasp for air . “

139465	139475	139462	139463	My girlfriend	2396	” I pant , and point to the flight . “
139490	139506	139488	139488	her	2396	” The guards exchange looks and with an eye roll , one of them says , “
139520	139594	139518	139518	sir	0	” Deflation fills me and I drop my shoes and belt and put my hands on my knees as I try to catch my breath . Fuck it . . . she ’s gone . . . But where to ? I glance up and see the flight destination . Honolulu Flight 245 American Airlines I stand with renewed purpose , put my shoes on , and roll my belt into my hand . “
139597	139614	139518	139518	sir	0	” I march off . Fuckers . I dial my security ; he answers first ring . “

139662	139683	139657	139657	I	0	” KATE The transfer car pulls up in front of the villa , and the driver turns in his seat . “
139689	139950	139688	139688	Miss.	237	” I peer out as relief fills me ; looks okay . I always have that panic moment when I see a place I booked online . I pay him and he takes my suitcase from the trunk . Thank God I arranged all this last week . When I had n’t heard from Elliot , when he was with her . . . the thought of seeing him at work was mortifying . I booked this holiday to give myself some space . I did n’t tell anyone about it except Brad . Not even Daniel and Rebecca . If they did n’t know where I was then they could n’t accidently tell anyone , and thank God I did n’t . I had no idea how much it was going to be needed . I ’m on Lanikai Beach , Kailua , on the island of Oahu , Hawaii . The sound and smell of the ocean overwhelms me , and I wave my driver goodbye and walk up the steps . The keys are in a lock box and excitement fills me . A hot shower . . . and some sleep . I ’ve had a horrendous trip , and to be honest I was half expecting the Miles jet to pull up alongside us and hijack my plane , and for Elliot to board mid - air and drag me off . To get here alone and safe is a relief . The key turns and I walk in and gasp . Oh my God . “
139954	140066	139688	139688	Miss.	237	” It ’s a little villa , in the shape of a hexagon , on the edge of a cliff . Huge windows with views of the sea are everywhere you look , and palm trees are on the edge of the waterline . This place looks straight out of a movie . I smile , lock the door behind me , and look around : one bedroom , a small , tidy bathroom , and an octagon - shaped living and kitchen area with light timber floors . Through large timber French doors is a huge deck , and I walk out to feel the sea breeze on my face . “
140069	140354	139688	139688	Miss.	237	” I smile into the view , stare out for a while , and then my mind goes to Elliot back home . . . and I can almost feel his panic . I know he ’ll be worried . But I ca n’t think of him right now . For once in my life , I have to put myself first . I understand what he told me yesterday , that he loves me and that he did n’t do anything with his beloved artist . And maybe if he had come straight home after he saw her I would have forgiven him and moved on . But he took a week to convince himself that he wanted to be with me . To talk himself into his so - called happiness . If he loved me as he said he does , there would have been no soul - searching to arrive at that decision . He would have come straight home . . . to me . I hate that he did n’t . I get a vision of us laughing and making love and of all the wonderful late - night deep and meaningful conversations we had in bed , and my heart hurts . For a while there , I let myself believe that we had something special . I exhale sadly ; but it was n’t to be . Elliot Miles is n’t the only one who wants the happily - ever - after with someone extraordinary . . . and guess what , I ’m waiting for it . Even if it kills me . . . and the way I feel now , it just might . “
140357	140367	139688	139688	Miss.	237	” I smile at the kind - looking waiter . “
140379	140440	139688	139688	Miss.	237	” I ’ve been here for four days and ca n’t stomach the thought of going back . I called the real - estate agent and the place I ’m staying at now is coming up for long - term rent . I ’m going to stay for a while and put some roots down while I sort myself out . “
140443	140453	140456	140456	Steven	69	” He smiles as he wipes down the bar . “
140458	140459	140456	140456	Steven	69	” “
140462	140482	140456	140456	Steven	69	” I feel so awkward , and I clutch my résumé in my hands with white - knuckle force . “
140489	140493	140456	140456	Steven	69	” he asks . “
140496	140497	140456	140456	Steven	69	” “

140533	140537	140456	140456	Steven	69	” He frowns . “

140625	140959	140618	140618	you	69	” The sound of the ocean laps at the shore and I smile into the sun as I walk along . This place is heaven . And not just because it was my escape plan . For the first time in a long time , probably since my parents died , I feel proud of myself . I ’ve pushed myself way out of my comfort zone . I did n’t want to stay in London ; my gut told me to leave . There were too many questions between us , too little trust on my behalf . Even though I wanted to stay and fight for us , I knew that I needed this time alone . To regroup and find out who I am again . It ’s as if I ’m finally coming into my own . I ’ve lived in the shadow of my parents ’ death for seven dark years . . . but somehow , this new heartache over Elliot has snapped me out of it . For a long time , I wanted a change , but I was always too cautious and scared , then this happened and suddenly without hesitation I moved to the other side of the world . I was tired of IT so I now work nights in a restaurant . Everything I ’ve been pushing through over the last few years , the staleness and boredom . . . I do n’t feel it anymore . I wake up every day renewed , a little sad . . . but still , excited for what ’s coming . I ’ve been doing yoga as the sun comes up on the beach ; I swim in the ocean and lie in the sun . I go for a big walk and then have an afternoon nap . At night , I go to work in the restaurant . It ’s fun and easy and the people there are so nice . “
140967	140980	140618	140618	you	69	” a man says as he rides past me on a pushbike . “
140984	141058	140618	140618	you	69	” I smile as I get to the row of shops in town . This place is so lovely and quaint , and I come here most afternoons to buy my food for the following day . I walk past a hobby shop and stop and look through the window : what ’s in there ? I ’ll take a look , so I walk in and a bell rings over the door . “
141061	141067	140618	140618	you	69	” An elderly woman smiles . “
141070	141071	140618	140618	you	69	” “

141084	141273	141073	141073	I	0	” I reply . I walk through the cross - stitch section and smile sadly as I look at all the patterns . My mum would have loved this shop . When I was a teenager we used to spend hours together in the garden house , and she would do her cross - stitch and I would paint . We would laugh and talk and listen to music . I smile as I remember making her play Taylor Swift on repeat for hours and hours . I pick up a cross - stitch pattern of a duck and I smile as I think of Elliot and his girls . Maybe I should learn how to do cross - stitch ? It could be an ode to my mum . I look through all the patterns , but end up back at the ducks . I want this one ; I liked those bat - shit crazy ducks of Elliot ’s . I remember the day they attacked him and it brings a smile to my face . I tuck the packet under my arm and keep looking . “
141285	141291	141073	141073	I	0	” the old lady calls . “

141323	141556	141302	141302	I	0	” She smiles . Hmm , I guess it could be . I mean , if I ’m learning how to cross - stitch , I guess I could paint a picture too . I ’m totally crap at it . . . but it would make me feel close to Mum , by association . She always loved my paintings , said every new painting I did was her new favorite . Is n’t that what all mums say to their kids about their hideous hobbies ? I pick up a packet of paintbrushes and a starter pack of ten tubes of paint , go to the back and look through the canvases . Shit . . . these are expensive . Did Mum really pay this much ? I smile , knowing exactly why she did : so that I would sit with her while she did her cross - stitch . There was a method to her madness , after all . I pick up a small canvas , which will be easier to fit into the bin when I fuck it up . I take my things to the cashier , and I feel really excited for tomorrow . When I get back from the beach , I ’m going to start learning how to do my cross - stitch , just like Mum . How fun .

141955	142577	142578	142578	Pinkie	71	” I look at the letter in my hand . Miss Pinkie Leroo 98 Grosvenor Street Mayweather , Oahu . I turn it over and look at the back for the sender . Edgar Moffatt Garbologist Extraordinaire Enchanted Kingdom I smirk . Garbologist extraordinaire . . . idiot . I walk back inside and put the envelope on the countertop . I ’m not reading it . It ’s 11 p.m. when I walk in the door and I go straight to the envelope and pick it up . Work was so busy tonight and I was torturing myself the entire shift wondering what this says . How does he know where I am ? I pick up the envelope and stare at it . What does he want ? There ’s only one way to find out . Fuck it . I tear open the envelope . My dearest Pinkie , In light of my inability to call you , and not wanting to stalk you , serial - killer style , I have decided to go old school and write you a letter . To receive a total package experience , please spray this letter with the spray that is enclosed in the envelope . I frown : what the hell ? I turn the envelope upside down and a tiny spray bottle falls out onto the countertop . I pick it up and read the little label . Elliot Miles — Love Potion . I roll my lips to suppress my smile , hold it to my nose , and close my eyes as a flood of memories runs through me . It ’s Elliot ’s aftershave . Hmmm . I read on . I ’m writing to you with the greatest of news , you are to be a GG , also known as a Goat Grandma . I put my hand over my mouth and burst out laughing . What the hell ? The veterinarian has just left and he has confirmed my suspicions . Gretel your goat is pregnant . The expected arrival date is in 40 days , and I ca n’t wait . Finally , some good news . I hope you are well ? I hope you know how much of my strength it ’s taking to not come to you . Please know how much you are missed . Forever yours , Elliot ox Short and sweet . My heart swells and I bite my lip . I pick up the tiny spray bottle and hold it to my nose . . . smells like heaven . Elliot Miles . I read the letter again . . . and again , and then I do as he asks . I spray the letter with his cologne . And with a big smile on my face , and the scent of Elliot Miles swimming around me , I read it again . Chapter 26 I smile as I mix the paint in my palette ; who knew I would love this so much . It ’s taken me back to a time when I was happy and carefree . . . I also have to admit , Elliot ’s letter yesterday has lifted my spirits . He gets it . He could have come here and talked me around and dragged me home . . . but he ’s letting me work this out for myself . I hear a car pull up and I go and look out of the window . It ’s the van . I smile . I open the door in a rush to see the delivery driver get out of his van with another red envelope . “

My dearest Pinkie , In light of my inability to call you , and not wanting to stalk you , serial - killer style , I have decided to go old school and write you a letter . To receive a total package experience , please spray this letter with the spray that is enclosed in the envelope . In light of your various fetishes , I will oblige you . Enclosed is a picture for your personal spank bank , use it willingly and often . I frown . What ? I search in the envelope and , inside , there ’s a photograph wrapped in white paper . I tear it open and laugh . It ’s a picture of Elliot ’s bare feet , crossed at the ankles and resting up on an ottoman . He ’s sitting on his deck with the lake and his beautiful Enchanted rolling green hills in the background . There ’s a glass of Scotch on the side table and he ’s wearing grey sweatpants . I frown as I stare at it . Maybe he ’s onto something . This picture makes me want to be there . I keep reading . I hope you are well , my days are long , my nights are longer . You are missed , my love . Forever yours , Elliot . xo P.S. have you started knitting collars for your grandkids yet ? Apparently , twins are common . I ’m not nervous at all . I smile as my eyes linger on the letter ; I pick up the little bottle and spray the paper . I hold it to my nose and inhale deeply , and Elliot Miles in all his glory swims around me . These quirky little letters that are so him , mean a lot . I smile . It ’s a good day . ELLIOT Christopher pops his head around the door . “

143404	143446	143385	143385	We	2044	” I open the top drawer of my desk and pull out a red envelope . He snatches it off me and reads who it is addressed to and he frowns . Miss Pinkie Leroo 98 Grosvenor Street Mayweather , Oahu . “
143457	143458	143454	143455	Pinkie Leroo	71	” “

143579	143588	143562	143563	Mr. Moffatt	1104	” I slide my letter over the counter . “

143722	143905	143711	143711	I	0	” She smiles . Shut the fuck up . That ’s it , tomorrow I find a new post office . KATE I struggle up the road with my new canvas , which is huge . Like the ones I used to paint when I was just a girl . I ’m addicted to my new hobby and every day is better than the last . The sun , the sea , my life here . . . Edgar ’s letters . I have a new thirst for life , my old self is returning day by day . There ’s no pressure , no grief . . . only happy memories and freedom . I ’m going to call Elliot soon ; his quirky letters have made me feel closer to him . I read them constantly and may even sleep with the box I keep them all in . I want to fix this ; he ’s worth trying for . I come around the corner to see Richard ’s van parked out the front and I wave and smile . “
143913	143921	143908	143908	you	2046	” He holds up three red envelopes . “
143930	144006	143908	143908	you	2046	” My broad smile nearly splits my face . Elliot writes to me every day . And I know we did n’t have a romantic beginning , but he ’s definitely making up for it . Not that his letters are romantic , they ’re weird and funny little stories from his day . He sends me photos and clippings . Each one makes me smile , each one makes my day that much brighter . “
144018	144022	144015	144015	You	2046	” Richard asks . “
144025	144032	144015	144015	You	2046	” I shrug , slightly embarrassed . “

144096	144281	144088	144088	I	0	” He smiles , I sign for my letters and bounce up the stairs . I read through the envelopes to find Saturday ’s letter , as I like to read them in order . My dearest Pinkie , In light of my inability to call you , and not wanting to stalk you , serial - killer style , I have decided to go old school and write you a letter . To receive a total package experience , please spray this letter with the spray that is enclosed in the envelope . I smile as I imagine Elliot pouring his aftershave into these tiny bottles . I wonder , does he use a funnel ? And who makes these tiny labels ? I notice a photograph wrapped in white paper and I tear it open . It ’s a picture of an open hand , palm facing up . It has terrible huge blisters all over it . What the hell ? What ’s he done ? I read on . Actual footage of my right hand . I burst out laughing . “
144286	144374	144283	144283	you	2047	” My love , things are grim . My body needs you . It ’s been eight weeks since you touched me , it feels like forever . I waited thirty - five years to find you . How much longer must I wait to hold you again ? Forever yours , Elliot . xo Emotion overwhelms me and I blink through tears . I walk outside and put my canvas on the easel and pour myself a glass of wine , turn up Taylor Swift ’s song “
144376	145014	145016	145016	you	2048	” on repeat , and begin to fill my canvas with paint . I smile as I listen to the words . ELLIOT I sit on my deck and stare out over Enchanted . It ’s late , near midnight . . . but I ca n’t sleep . I have n’t been able to relax in what feels like weeks . I ’m mentally drained . Kate ’s in Hawaii . . . and all I want to do is go to her and make her come back with me , but her brother ’s words keep rolling around in my head . I know I could go to her , talk her around , and bring her home . . . but she needs to want to be here . She knows how I feel and yet , she still left me . How could I have fucked this up so bad ? I think over the events of that first week after she left and , to be honest , I ’m glad Kate did n’t have to suffer it . I ’ve had to lodge court proceedings to silence the gossip about the love triangle ; it ’s been a media - circus nightmare . I lift my Scotch to my lips and sip it slowly , and the heat burns my throat as it goes down . I ’ve been sending Pinkie letters , and baring my soul , but something ’s not sitting right . I ’m missing something in this puzzle . I have no idea what it is , but as the days go by and still no word from Kate , my agitation grows . I refill my glass of Scotch and light a cigar , blow out a thin stream of smoke into the crisp night air . My mind goes back to the picture she had framed for me for my birthday and I smile . I go and retrieve it from inside and stare at it in my hands . It ’s a photograph of me taken from behind , in a navy suit , staring out over the lake with the ducks around my feet . It ’s early morning and the mist is rolling on the paddocks in the background . Such a simple image and yet somehow it feels so intimate — her secret view of me when I was n’t looking . I turn it over and look at the back of the frame , and I wonder what the photo looks like without the glass on it . I retrieve a knife and undo the frame and I take the image out , turn it over and see her handwriting . Happy Birthday my darling , I love you . Always , Kate . My chest constricts and I read it again . . . and again . . . and again . Always , Kate . Always means forever . . . until it did n’t . I lift the cigar to my lips and inhale deeply . I ’m sad and forlorn , full of regret . My hands are tied , I ca n’t contact her . I ca n’t make her come home , no matter how much I want to . I have to do this on her terms and respect her decision . She has to want to come home to me . And I hate it . I tip my head back and drain the glass , then I fill it again so fast that it sloshes over the sides . Patience is n’t my strong point . Two months . I write to her every day . . . and yet , no word back . Does she even get my letters ? “
145018	145068	145016	145016	you	2048	” Christopher says to the waitress as she puts a plate of fortune cookies down in front of us . It ’s Friday night and Christopher has dragged me out for dinner . I want to be anywhere else but here . He passes the plate over to me . “
145072	145073	145016	145016	you	2048	” “
145076	145085	145016	145016	you	2048	” He shoves the plate in my face . “
145095	145136	145016	145016	you	2048	” I roll my eyes and take one , crack it open . There is no such thing as a coincidence . I raise my eyebrow . Ha . . . once upon a time I would have believed that . “
145142	145155	145016	145016	you	2048	” Christopher asks . I throw my note over and he smiles . “
145172	145178	145016	145016	you	2048	” I stare at him . “
145245	145252	145238	145243	The woman you were already seeing	2396	” I frown as I listen . “

145283	145423	145265	145265	I	0	” My mind begins to tick as I read the little fortune cookie note again . There is no such thing as a coincidence . I always believed in it , that everything happens for a reason . No event or person in your life happens by accident and yet , here I am . I think hard . . . for a long time . Why does it feel off , what am I missing ? But what if falling for Kate was n’t a coincidence at all ? What if this is all the grand plan ? I read it again . There is no such thing as a coincidence . Hmm . The next day I knock on Brad ’s door . He opens it in a rush and his face falls as he sees me . “
145426	145430	145265	145265	I	0	” I smile . “

146852	146853	146848	146848	I	0	” “
146856	146862	146848	146848	I	0	” I try to think . “
146877	146912	146871	146871	she	2396	” Brad shrugs and texts Kate . Hey , I found these paintings in a charity shop . They looked familiar , are they yours ? My heart is hammering hard and I pace . “
146918	146919	146915	146915	she	2396	” “
146924	146942	146943	146943	She	2396	” I close my eyes and walk back and forth as my hands run through my hair . “
146952	147048	146943	146943	She	2396	” He holds his phone out and we both stare at it , waiting for the answer . Now , there ’s a blast from the past . Yeah , they ’re mine . I painted them years ago . God knows why Mum insisted on keeping them . I ca n’t believe Elanor thought someone would actually want them . Lol , hilarious . The air leaves my lungs and I grip the wall to steady myself . Brad drops to sit on the couch and we stare at each other , eyes wide . “
147055	147064	147068	147068	Kate	2396	” Brad frowns as he connects the dots . “
147070	147074	147068	147068	Kate	2396	” I whisper . “
147080	147093	147096	147096	he	2067	” KATE I wait on the porch and look up the road . “
147098	147154	147096	147096	he	2067	” I glance at my watch . Richard did n’t bring me a letter yesterday . . . and he ’s late today . I did n’t realize how much Elliot ’s letters brighten my day . . . or how much they mean . I twist my hands in my lap as I wait . “
147158	147162	147096	147096	he	2067	” I whisper . “
147167	147461	147165	147165	you	2068	” What if he ’s met someone else ? Regret fills me that I have n’t responded to him at all . I should have said something , if even only a thank you . What must he think with no correspondence back ? A car comes around the corner and I hold my breath — it ’s a different car . Red . It ’s not Richard . My shoulders slump with deflation . The car pulls up to a halt outside my place and I frown as I watch . Who is it ? Elliot gets out of the backseat and my breath catches . What ? He looks up and his eyes find mine . . . Oh . Seeing him in the flesh opens old wounds and an unexpected rush of emotion sweeps through me . My eyes well with tears . Glued to the floor , I stand and watch him as he leans in and takes out an overnight bag and pays the driver , and I want to run to him . . . and kiss him and tell him everything . But my feet are set in concrete , frozen with fear . The hurt he caused me , magnified all over again . I thought my disappointment and anger were over — maybe not . He stands on the curb with his bag in his hand , staring up at me , and as the car drives off , he gives me a soft smile . And with my heart in my throat , I smile . Oh . . . I ’ve missed him so . He slowly walks up the steps and I walk down them and we meet in the middle . “
147464	147468	147165	147165	you	2068	” he whispers . “
147471	147472	147473	147473	I	0	” “
147480	147558	147473	147473	I	0	” His eyes hold mine as he swallows a lump in his throat . He ’s nervous . My eyes well with tears , because suddenly everything is crystal clear : he is my home . Elliot Casanova Miles is the great love of my life , and I do n’t know how it worked out that way , but I honestly do n’t think I can go on without him . I would n’t want to . “
147563	147599	147473	147473	I	0	” A slow , sexy smile crosses his face , and he wraps me in his arms and holds me tight . And he squeezes me and I melt into him as our lips touch . “
147608	147612	147473	147473	I	0	” he whispers . “
147618	147733	147473	147473	I	0	” He kisses me , his tongue slowly sliding between my lips as he holds my face in his hands and , oh . . . the way he kisses . I had nearly forgotten . Elliot Miles kisses from his soul . Every chink in his armor , every weakness he keeps inside , all the passion in the world . I can feel it all . And fuck , do I love it . We kiss again and he pulls me toward him , hugs me tight in his arms as the horror we ’ve been through becomes too much . The emotion between us . . . too much . Sacred . “
147739	147754	147755	147755	I	0	” he says as he takes my hand and leads me up the steps . “
147758	147841	147845	147845	baby	2372	” His eyes flick back to me as if questioning my statement . Huh , what was that look ? I frown as uneasiness runs through me : he ’s here to tell me something . There ’s more . Did he sleep with his artist ? My heart begins to race as I brace myself . Somehow , I do n’t think our reunion is going to stay happy . We walk into the living area and he turns toward me . “
147854	147895	147845	147845	baby	2372	” I drop to the couch without question . Thump , thump , thump sounds my pulse in my ears . He goes to his overnight bag and takes out a large , yellow envelope and passes it to me . “
147901	147902	147898	147899	Harriet Boucher	84	” “
147905	147909	147898	147899	Harriet Boucher	84	” I frown . “
147931	147932	147898	147899	Harriet Boucher	84	” “
147952	147956	147940	147940	she	84	” I spit . “
147960	147964	147965	147965	I	0	” he demands . “
147969	147970	147965	147965	I	0	” “
147974	148027	148028	148028	I	0	” he barks . I open the envelope and pull out the large A4 - sized photographs , and I frown . It ’s Elanor . I flick through them — image after image of Elanor . Black and white , color , different locations . I shake my head , confused . “
148033	148041	148028	148028	I	0	” He passes me a white envelope . “
148052	148068	148069	148069	Elliot	89	” I screw up my face ; what the fuck is he going on about ? “
148075	148076	148069	148069	Elliot	89	” “
148080	148129	148069	148069	Elliot	89	” he barks . Jeez , psycho . . . I open the envelope and my eyes widen . I flick through the images , confusion takes me over . I know these paintings . . . I did these paintings . My eyes rise to meet his . “
148144	148173	148142	148142	you	89	” he whispers . Goosebumps scatter up my spine . He drops to his knees on the floor in front of me , takes my hands in his . “
148185	148199	148204	148204	you	89	” My eyes well with tears as my world spins on its axis . “
148206	148210	148204	148204	you	89	” he whispers . “
148237	148245	148246	148246	I	0	” I drop my head , overwhelmed . “
148261	148268	148256	148256	I	0	” I look up at him . “
148274	148278	148256	148256	I	0	” I whisper . “
148284	148285	148256	148256	I	0	” “
148294	148295	148296	148296	Brad	68	” “
148298	148302	148303	148303	Brad	68	” I frown . “
148308	148336	148337	148337	Elanor	0	” He nods and leans up and kisses me tenderly as if to soften the blow , but I ca n’t feel it . I ’m numb . “
148349	148355	148356	148356	She	0	” My eyes hold his . “
148393	148397	148399	148399	she	0	” Horror dawns . “
148429	148441	148443	148443	she	0	” My chest rises and falls as I scramble for air . “
148468	148478	148479	148479	She	0	” Elanor is the artist he met in France ? “
148519	148528	148529	148529	Elliot	89	” I put my head into my hands . “
148531	148545	148546	148546	I	0	” I whisper . He hugs me and pulls my head to his . “
148553	148568	148546	148546	I	0	” A thought comes to me and I pull back to look at him . “
148578	148586	148546	148546	I	0	” He puffs air into his cheeks . “
148592	148607	148608	148609	You idiot	2357	” I put my hands over my mouth as my eyes widen in horror . “
148630	148641	148628	148628	Elliot	89	” His face softens , then he smiles and chuckles . “
148652	148656	148642	148642	I	0	” I scoff . “
148669	148690	148642	148642	I	0	” He tips his head back and laughs hard , as if the weight of the world has been lifted . “
148694	148704	148642	148642	I	0	” I stand as another thought comes to me . “
148709	148719	148720	148720	Elliot	89	” He falls silent , his eyes hold mine . “
148726	148727	148728	148728	She	0	” “
148737	148738	148728	148728	She	0	” “
148741	148746	148747	148747	I	0	” My chest tightens . “
148754	148762	148747	148747	I	0	” He takes my hands in his . “
148771	148776	148763	148763	We	2084	” he says sternly . “
148779	148780	148763	148763	We	2084	” “
148782	148785	148767	148767	Elanor	0	now”—he kisses me softly—“I
148793	148806	148763	148763	We	2084	” He kisses me again as he holds my head to his . “
148822	148848	148849	148849	You	2085	” Elliot Miles calling Elanor a witch brings an unexpected smile to my face , and I know it should n’t , but it does . “
148855	148872	148849	148849	You	2085	” He smiles as his lips take mine ; he walks forward and I walk back . “
148881	148885	148877	148877	I	0	” I reply . “
148890	148896	148897	148897	You	2085	” He smiles against me . “
148902	148927	148897	148897	You	2085	” In one sharp movement , he bends and throws me over his shoulder . I laugh out loud and he slaps my behind . “
148942	148943	148935	148935	You	2085	” “
148951	148960	148946	148946	you	2085	” I laugh as I hang upside down . “
148966	148967	148946	148946	you	2085	” “
148970	149115	149116	149116	You	2090	” He slaps my behind again . He carries me into the bedroom and throws me on the bed , and I bounce as I land . With his eyes locked on mine he takes his shirt off over his head . His chest is broad with a scattering of dark hair , his tanned shoulders and arms cut with definition , his stomach rippled with muscles . But it ’s his eyes that arrest me , filled with desire and love and a sense of belonging . Home . In slow motion he slides down his trousers and my breath catches . No matter how many times I see him naked , I ’m never prepared for his powerful beauty . Elliot Miles is a million things , but most of all . . . he ’s mine . He crawls over me . “
149128	149141	149116	149116	You	2090	” he says as he nips my hip bone through my dress . “
149144	149152	149116	149116	You	2090	” I sit up , remembering something . “
149155	149156	149116	149116	You	2090	” “
149159	149168	149169	149169	I	0	” I jump up and take his hand . “
149176	149290	149169	149169	I	0	” I drag him out into the other room and hold my hand up toward my easel . It ’s a huge oil painting of the two of us together ; I ’ve been working on it for weeks . We are in each other ’s arms , staring lovingly at each other . A moment of intimacy between us , captured in my memory . His breath catches as he stares at it , and he runs his finger over the title of the painting at the bottom right corner . Forever Enchanted . His nostrils flare and he presses his lips together , overwhelmed with emotion . His eyes find mine . “
149295	149299	149300	149300	I	0	” he whispers . “
149304	149318	149320	149320	me	0	” He kisses me and we melt together and , oh . . . “
149322	149331	149320	149320	me	0	” I pull back to look at him . “
149334	149335	149339	149339	Kathryn	2396	” “
149360	149365	149366	149366	I	0	” He wells up . “
149371	149378	149366	149366	I	0	” Oh , I love him . “
149396	149410	149411	149411	I	0	” He looks down at himself and then breaks into a slow smile . “
149416	149436	149413	149413	I	0	” He kisses me and pulls me close , and I can feel every hard inch that he has . “
149446	149471	149444	149444	Landon	2396	” He drags me over his hard cock . I giggle . Only him . He jerks me against him , demanding an answer . “
149479	149577	149578	149578	Elliot	89	” We laugh against each other ’s lips and he picks me up and carries me back to the bedroom , then he lifts my dress over my head and then takes off my bra and panties and lays me down . He lies down beside me and spreads my legs ; his fingers find that sweet spot as he kisses me deeply . My back arches off the bed as he works me harder , and harder . The sound of my wet arousal echoes around us but he does n’t stop , he pushes me . “
149580	149584	149578	149578	Elliot	89	” I murmur . “
149609	149683	149686	149686	El	89	” His voice is deep , commanding , and I know he ’s running on pure instinct . The urge to fuck has taken him over and he ’s losing control by the second . I slide my hand down and feel him : he ’s rock - hard with pre - ejaculate dripping from his end . God , how did I ever think I could live without this ? Without him . “
149688	149698	149686	149686	El	89	” I whisper as I pull him over me . “
149701	149746	149747	149747	I	0	” With his dark eyes locked on mine , he rolls over me and nudges my opening with his tip , and I feel the burn of his possession . Every time with this man is like the first . His size , unforgiving . “
149751	149861	149862	149862	You	2093	” His eyes flutter closed . I smile against him and then he pushes in hard , nailing me to the mattress . Forcing my body to accept his . His sweet words in vast contrast to his hard actions . I cling to his broad shoulders and I close my eyes as I try to deal with him . Ouch . Elliot Miles was born to fuck , unapologetic , and hard . He pulls out and slides back in , his eyes dark with want . He rotates his hips one way , and then the other . Stretching me , opening me up for his pleasure . “
149865	149879	149880	149880	I	0	” he murmurs , his eyes locked on my lips . I nod . “
149886	150055	149880	149880	I	0	” He bites my neck as his hips begin to pump , hard , thick , and fast , and oh hell . I arch my back , his cock working at piston pace . His big hands grab my inner thighs as he holds my legs open , his knees spread wide , and I can see every muscle in his torso as it contracts . The sound of the bed hitting the wall with force echoes around us and I scream out as I come hard . I hold him tight , through the ecstasy , as all the pain from the last few months is washed away with love . He holds himself deep and I feel the telling jerk of his cock deep inside my body . And he kisses me , tenderly , with so much love that I can hardly stand it , and my world stops . And another life begins . Mrs. Miles . Elliot takes me by the hand . “
150063	150070	150061	150061	sweetheart	107	” I look around the airplane . “
150077	150078	150061	150061	sweetheart	107	” “
150087	150100	150084	150085	Mr. Miles	51	” the pilot says . He turns to me and nods kindly . “
150108	150109	150106	150106	Kathryn	2396	” “
150113	150144	150146	150146	Kate	2396	” Elliot shakes his hand and leads me down the stairs where the black Bentley is parked . Andrew gets out , and he smiles broadly when he sees us . “
150148	150165	150146	150146	Kate	2396	” I skip over to him and go up onto my toes and kiss his cheek . “
150169	150170	150167	150167	Andrew	0	” “
150179	150193	150167	150167	Andrew	0	” He beams . I giggle and hunch my shoulders up in excitement . “
150199	150203	150204	150204	I	0	” I gush . “
150208	150370	150204	150204	I	0	” He smiles as his eyes flick to Elliot , who smirks in return . Elliot ca n’t even act grumpy . In fact , that sexy - as - fuck smile has n’t left his face , and after the dreamiest five days in Oahu , we ’ve landed back in London . Elliot publicly announced today that we are engaged to be married , and in some kind of strategic plan he told me that I would be photographed tonight , which I ’m guessing was code for . . . do n’t wear your sweatpants on the plane . I did wonder why he changed into a full three - piece suit before we landed . Andrew and Elliot load all of our things in the trunk and I get into the backseat . Elliot slides in behind me and picks up my hand and rests it on his thick quad ; he always has to be touching . “
150381	150394	150379	150379	sir	0	” Andrew asks as he makes eye contact in the rearview mirror . “
150397	150466	150379	150379	sir	0	” Elliot replies . Schedule . . . there ’s a schedule ? We zoom off into the night and twenty minutes later we come around the corner into the street where Elliot ’s swanky apartment is ; there are photographers everywhere . I feel my anxiety rise and instead of pulling into the private undercover parking lot , Andrew pulls the car up right next to them . “
150472	150483	150379	150379	sir	0	” I whisper . Elliot leans over and kisses me . “
150490	150491	150379	150379	sir	0	” “
150494	150495	150379	150379	sir	0	” “
150523	150606	150616	150617	Mr. Miles	51	” I stare at my beautiful man . This goes against everything he is , but he wants me to be left alone , he ’s doing this for me . The door opens in a rush . Andrew stands outside as the cameras flash . Elliot gets out , takes my hand , and helps me from the car . I climb out to the blinding lights of flashes and the sound of photographers screaming over the top of each other . “
150612	150613	150616	150617	Mr. Miles	51	” “
150619	150620	150621	150621	Kathryn	2396	” “
150630	150652	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” Elliot takes my hand and in slow motion lifts it to his lips and kisses it . They go wild . “
150655	150659	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” someone calls . “
150674	150721	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” Elliot chuckles , our eyes are locked as electricity bounces between us , and he raises an eyebrow as he waits for my answer . If only they knew that the supposed Casanova is a romantic fool . I turn back to them and smile . “
150724	150966	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” We pose for a few shots and then he leads me into the building by the hand as they yell to us in the background . I get into the elevator with the love of my life . He smiles down at me and I smile right back up at him . Turns out I do believe in fairy tales . And fate . Never give up , he will find you . Love always , Kate . Xox The Epilogue I sit at the desk with the glass screen in front of me , waiting to see my sister Elanor . She ’s being held in custody until her court case , and although Elliot and I have had an almighty row over this , he refuses to drop the charges . And I get it , I really do . Brad is working with Elliot and they ’re doing this together . Weirdly enough they get on very well and Brad spends a lot of time at Enchanted with us . I wo n’t testify against Elanor , not ever ; she ’s my sister . They have agreed that I can stay out of this . But I need to know why . Elanor comes into view . She ’s in a minimal - security prison and wearing a grey pant suit . I smile and stand and she smiles in return as she takes a seat . “
150969	150974	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” I sit down . “
150977	151038	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” She clasps her hands in front of her . I stare at her and my natural inclination is to apologize . After all , it is my fiancé who has put her here . But then I remember what she ’s done and if anyone should be angry , it should be me . What I am is disappointed . “
151055	151079	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” she says , void of emotion . My eyes hold hers and I wonder what the hell went so wrong with her . “
151082	151095	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” I ask . She shrugs as if she does n’t care . “
151108	151112	150653	150653	Kathryn	2396	” I frown . “
151132	151144	151128	151128	Mum	135	” My heart constricts , is that how she saw it ? “
151159	151167	151168	151168	I	0	” She lifts her chin in defiance . “
151175	151180	151181	151182	Mrs. Miles	148	” She smiles sarcastically . “
151184	151194	151181	151182	Mrs. Miles	148	” I nod , my hands clenched into fists . “
151200	151204	151205	151205	He	2101	” She smirks . “
151220	151237	151238	151238	I	0	” She readjusts herself on the chair as if proud of herself for being so mean . “
151254	151263	151238	151238	I	0	” I whisper . Her eyes search mine . “
151280	151333	151264	151264	I	0	” I say . Her eyes well with tears and for the first time since my parents died , I see the sweet little girl that she always was . Grief works in different ways . Although always destructive , its effects changed her . This is n’t who she really is . “
151362	151381	151382	151382	Kate	2396	” She inhales sharply as if shocked by my support . I stand and turn to walk out . “
151384	151392	151382	151382	Kate	2396	” she calls . I turn back . “
151404	151412	151382	151382	Kate	2396	” I smile through tears and nod . “
151415	151490	151491	151491	Kathryn	2396	” I turn and walk out . We have a lot of shit to work through , but I ’m no quitter . ELLIOT A toast : I hold my glass up to my beautiful bride as she sits beside me . We are now husband and wife , married in a white marquee in the grounds of Enchanted . My brothers are beside me , our closest fifty friends and family are here . “
151493	151500	151502	151502	Kate	2396	” I smile down at her . “
151504	151505	151502	151502	Kate	2396	” “
151511	151519	151502	151502	Kate	2396	” I hear Christopher whisper to Tristan , “
151524	151531	151532	151532	I	0	” Tristan chuckles as he listens . “
151550	151566	151532	151532	I	0	” She reaches up and takes my hand and kisses it from her seated position . “
151596	151600	151591	151591	you	2396	” She smiles . “
151607	151622	151591	151591	you	2396	” Emotion overwhelms me and I pause with a frown , clear my throat . “
151641	151667	151668	151668	I	0	” Her eyes fill with tears and I have to stop before I get really fucking pathetic . I hold my glass in the air . “
151681	151682	151674	151676	my beautiful wife	2105	” “
151686	151768	151674	151676	my beautiful wife	2105	” They all cheer . It ’s dusk and I ’m standing with Tristan , Jameson , and Christopher . Kate is dancing with her brother , and it ’s been a wonderful day . The best . We are under the huge oak tree that ’s strung with fairy lights . Patrick , Tristan ’s youngest son , runs up , panting . He looks out of breath and slightly panicked , and points toward the paddock . Tristan frowns . “
151773	151774	151775	151775	I	0	” “
151780	151781	151775	151775	I	0	” “
151785	151786	151775	151775	I	0	” “
151791	151798	151775	151775	I	0	” Harry mutters under his breath . “
151802	151815	151816	151816	Harry	121	” Tristan asks more sternly . Patrick points to his elder brother . “
151821	151822	151816	151816	Harry	121	” “
151828	151857	151825	151825	you	0	” Tristan takes Patrick ’s hand and leads him away . I watch as they walk down toward the bottom paddock and I continue talking to my brothers . “
151860	151871	151825	151825	you	0	” I hear Tristan ’s bloodcurdling scream in the distance . “
151876	151899	151825	151825	you	0	” We all look down and see Humphrey the ram chasing the two of them back up the hill at full speed . “
151909	151913	151907	151907	Harrison	121	” Jameson barks . “
151925	151929	151918	151918	he	121	” he yells . “
151938	151990	151918	151918	he	121	” Everyone starts screaming as the ram runs toward us , then he stops and , seemingly distracted , begins to head - butt a tree at full force . The sound echoes like thunder . Then he turns and rams into Daniel , who goes flying spectacularly in the air . “
151998	152012	152013	152013	Elliot	1448	” Jameson winces . The guests all run for their lives , screaming . “
152015	152019	152013	152013	Elliot	1448	” Kate cries . “
152023	152035	152013	152013	Elliot	1448	” Christopher ’s eyes widen and then he bursts out laughing . “
152040	152057	152058	152058	Everyone	2185	” Tristan is holding Patrick under his arm while he runs as fast as he can . “
152066	152070	152058	152058	Everyone	2185	” he screams . “
152077	152087	152089	152089	Harry	121	” I clench my jaw , ready to explode . “
