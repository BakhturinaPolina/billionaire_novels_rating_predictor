76	82	83	83	I	3245	“ And your point is ? ”
86	127	83	83	I	3245	“ My point is we paid the staff out of the overdraft this week . And I know you do n’t want to admit this , but we are in trouble , Claire . You need to hear him out . ”
311	333	334	334	Marley	100	“ Just listen to what he has to say — that ’s all . You never know what he might offer , ”
337	343	344	344	I	3245	“ Oh , come on , ”
347	355	344	344	I	3245	“ We both know what he wants . ”

423	429	430	430	I	3245	“ Do n’t get excited . ”
433	447	430	430	I	3245	“ I ’m just doing this to shut you up , you know ? ”
448	463	408	408	I	3245	“ Good , mouth officially shut from here on out . Cross my heart . ”
464	468	469	469	I	3245	“ If only . ”
472	479	469	469	I	3245	“ Will you come with me ? ”
480	501	502	502	I	3245	“ Yes , for sure . We ’ll stick Mr. Fancy Pants ’s checkbook where the sun does n’t shine . ”
508	513	502	502	I	3245	“ Okay , deal . ”
569	578	579	579	I	3245	“ Why are we meeting here , again ? ”
582	600	579	579	I	3245	“ He wanted to meet somewhere neutral . He has a table booked at Bryant Park Grill . ”
601	612	613	613	I	3245	“ That ’s odd — it ’s not a date , ”
616	627	628	628	She	269	“ It ’s probably all part of his grand plan . ”
639	643	644	644	She	269	“ Neutral ground . ”
651	662	644	644	She	269	“ While he tries to fuck us up the ass . ”
663	671	672	672	I	3245	“ With a smile on his face . ”
675	684	685	685	Marley	100	“ I hope it at least feels good . ”
696	702	703	703	she	269	“ So remember the strategy , ”
710	713	703	703	she	269	“ Yes . ”
714	728	729	729	she	269	“ Tell me it again . . . so that I remember it , ”
745	757	758	758	I	3245	“ Stay calm ; do n’t let him ruffle my feathers , ”
761	782	758	758	I	3245	“ Do n’t say an outright no — just keep him on ice in the background as an insurance policy . ”
783	792	758	758	I	3245	“ Yes , that ’s a great plan . ”
793	803	804	804	We	270	“ It should be — you thought of it . ”
873	879	880	880	I	3245	“ Do I look okay ? ”
883	888	880	880	I	3245	“ You look hot . ”
893	910	911	911	She	275	“ I do n’t want to look hot , Marley . I want to look hard . ”
919	923	914	914	she	275	“ Totally hard . ”
932	938	924	924	She	275	“ Iron maiden snatch style . ”
1044	1049	1050	1050	she	276	“ Are you ready ? ”
1053	1074	1075	1075	Her	276	“ Yes . We ’re twenty minutes early — I wanted to get here first . Get the upper hand . ”
1079	1103	1104	1104	I	3245	“ When I ask you if you ’re ready , you ’re supposed to answer with , ‘ I was born ready . ’ ”
1109	1117	1104	1104	I	3245	“ Let ’s get this over with . ”
1136	1147	1132	1133	The waiter	281	“ Hello , ladies . How can I help you ? ”
1148	1151	1152	1152	I	3245	“ Ah . ”
1157	1164	1152	1152	I	3245	“ We are meeting someone here . ”
1165	1169	1170	1170	he	281	“ Tristan Miles ? ”
1182	1189	1178	1178	he	281	“ Yes . . . actually . ”
1190	1200	1201	1201	He	281	“ He has the private dining room booked upstairs . ”
1207	1213	1214	1214	I	3245	“ Of course he does , ”
1300	1310	1311	1311	Marley	100	“ Holy fuck . . . he ’s hot , ”
1314	1318	1311	1311	Marley	100	“ Shut up , ”

1340	1344	1345	1345	She	100	“ I know . ”
1416	1421	1422	1422	I	3245	“ Do n’t speak , ”
1425	1430	1431	1431	Marley	100	“ Can I whistle ? ”
1441	1459	1434	1434	she	100	“ I totally want to wolf whistle the fuck out of this guy . Asshole or not . ”
1474	1482	1460	1460	I	3245	“ Please , just do n’t speak , ”
1488	1493	1494	1494	She	100	“ Okay , okay . ”
1528	1536	1522	1522	he	284	“ Hello , I ’m Tristan Miles . ”
1599	1612	1613	1613	I	3245	“ Hello , I ’m Claire Anderson . Nice to meet you . ”
1618	1627	1613	1613	I	3245	“ This is Marley Smithson , my assistant . ”

1688	1693	1694	1694	He	284	“ Coffee ? Tea ? ”
1700	1711	1694	1694	He	284	“ I took the liberty of ordering us morning tea . ”
1712	1717	1718	1718	I	3245	“ Coffee , please , ”
1721	1725	1718	1718	I	3245	“ Just cream . ”
1726	1730	1731	1731	Marley	100	“ Me too , ”
1793	1812	1787	1787	His	284	“ It ’s nice to finally meet you , Claire . I ’ve heard so much about you . ”
1830	1833	1834	1834	I	3245	“ Likewise , ”
1918	1925	1906	1906	He	284	“ How has your week been ? ”
1926	1931	1932	1932	I	3245	“ Fine , thanks , ”
1940	1955	1932	1932	I	3245	“ Let ’s just cut to the chase , Mr. Miles , shall we ? ”
1956	1959	1960	1960	he	284	“ Tristan , ”
1964	1967	1968	1968	I	3245	“ Tristan , ”
1971	1999	2000	2000	He	284	“ Why do you want to meet with me so badly ? What could possibly warrant you calling me five times a week for the last month ? ”
2020	2032	2033	2033	I	3245	“ I ’ve been watching Anderson Media for some time now . ”
2039	2049	2033	2033	I	3245	“ And do tell — what have you learned ? ”
2050	2059	2015	2015	his	284	“ You are letting staff go every month . ”
2060	2065	2033	2033	I	3245	“ I ’m downsizing . ”
2066	2071	2074	2075	this man	284	“ Not by choice . ”
2082	2096	2097	2097	I	3245	“ I ’m not interested in what you ’re offering , Mr. Miles , ”
2143	2156	2157	2157	he	284	“ How do you know I want to make you an offer ? ”
2170	2175	2165	2165	he	284	“ Do n’t you ? ”
2176	2179	2180	2180	He	284	“ No . ”
2185	2203	2180	2180	He	284	“ I would like to buy your company , but I ’m not offering a free pass . ”
2204	2208	2209	2209	I	3245	“ Free pass , ”
2239	2244	2245	2245	she	100	“ Happy , happy , ”
2248	2262	2245	2245	she	100	“ And what do you mean by a free pass , Mr. Miles ? ”
2263	2266	2267	2267	he	284	“ Tristan , ”
2271	2280	2281	2281	He	284	“ I ’ll call you whatever I want . ”
2298	2327	2281	2281	He	284	“ I can see you ’re a passionate woman , Claire , and that ’s admirable . . . but come on . Let ’s be serious here . ”
2339	2365	2366	2366	He	284	“ The last three years your company has run at a massive loss . You ’re losing advertising accounts left , right , and center . ”
2379	2389	2374	2374	he	284	“ I ’m guessing the financials are a nightmare . ”
2404	2423	2390	2390	I	3245	“ I can take everything off your hands , and you can take a hard - earned break . ”
2432	2469	2470	2470	His	284	“ You would love that , would n’t you ? Play Mr. Nice Guy and take everything off my hands . . . come in on your horse and save the day like a white knight . ”
2485	2502	2503	2503	I	3245	“ I will hold on to my company if it ’s the last thing I do . ”
2521	2528	2511	2511	I	3245	“ Stop kicking me , Marley , ”
2544	2551	2552	2552	he	3029	“ Keep kicking her , Marley , ”
2555	2562	2563	2563	I	3245	“ Kick some sense into her . ”
2589	2630	2581	2581	He	3029	“ Claire , let ’s get one thing straight . I always get what I want . And what I want is Anderson Media . I can take it now from you for a good price that will protect you . Or”—he
2632	2657	2658	2658	He	3029	casually—“I can wait for six months until the liquidators move in and get it for next to nothing , and you can face bankruptcy . ”
2670	2679	2658	2658	He	3029	“ We both know the end is near . ”
2680	2687	2688	2688	I	3245	“ You self - conceited prick , ”
2702	2710	2691	2691	He	3029	“ Nice guys come last , Claire . ”
2722	2727	2728	2728	He	3029	“ Think about it . ”
2748	2770	2771	2771	he	3029	“ I know this is not how you want to sell your company . But you need to be a realist , ”
2803	2826	2827	2827	My	3245	“ Take the offer , Claire . I ’ll email you a figure this afternoon . You will be taken care of . ”
2838	2854	2855	2855	I	3245	“ And who will take care of my late husband ’s memory , Mr. Miles ? ”
2858	2867	2868	2868	He	3029	“ Miles Media sure as hell wo n’t . ”
2879	2890	2868	2868	He	3029	“ Do you know anything about me and my company ? ”
2891	2895	2868	2868	He	3029	“ I do . ”
2896	2937	2938	2938	His	3029	“ Then you ’ll know that this company was my husband ’s labor of love . He worked for ten years to build it up from the ground . His dream was to hand it down to his three sons . ”
2943	2952	2954	2954	my	3245	“ So . . . do n’t you fucking dare”—I
2964	3000	3001	3001	I	3245	tears—“sit there with that smug look on your face and threaten me . Because believe me . . . Mr. Miles , whatever you ’re dishing out is n’t half as bad as losing him . ”
3004	3030	3031	3031	He	3029	“ I ’ve already been to hell and back , and I will not have some rich , spoiled bastard make me feel like shit . ”
3038	3045	3031	3031	He	3029	“ Do n’t call me again , ”
3055	3062	3046	3046	I	3245	“ Think about it , Claire . ”
3063	3068	3069	3069	I	3245	“ Go to hell . ”
3077	3093	3094	3094	Marley	100	“ She ’s just having a bad day . We ’ll definitely think about it , ”
3099	3109	3094	3094	Marley	100	“ Thanks for the cake — it was yummy . ”
3180	3203	3167	3167	She	100	“ Oh , screw this , Claire — let ’s not go back to work . Let ’s go get drunk instead . ”
3323	3394	3315	3315	her	1101	“ So . . . do n’t you fucking dare sit there with that smug look on your face and threaten me . Because believe me . . . Mr. Miles , whatever you ’re dishing out is n’t half as bad as losing him . I ’ve already been to hell and back , and I will not have some rich , spoiled bastard make me feel like shit . ”
3446	3452	3438	3438	I	3245	“ Claire Anderson ’s office . ”
3453	3463	3472	3472	she	1101	“ Hello , Marley . It ’s Tristan Miles . ”
3464	3471	3472	3472	she	1101	“ Oh , hello , Tristan , ”
3476	3482	3472	3472	she	1101	“ Are you after Claire ? ”
3483	3493	3438	3438	I	3245	“ Yes , I am . Is she available ? ”
3494	3502	3472	3472	she	1101	“ I ’ll put you straight through . ”
3503	3507	3508	3508	I	3245	“ Thank you . ”
3516	3522	3513	3513	she	1101	“ Hello , Claire speaking . ”
3544	3553	3531	3531	her	1101	“ Hello , Claire . It ’s Tristan . ”
3554	3557	3558	3558	She	1101	“ Oh . ”
3585	3607	3608	3608	I	3245	“ I just wanted to see if you were okay after our meeting . I ’m sorry if I upset you . ”
3628	3640	3608	3608	I	3245	“ My feelings are no concern of yours , Mr. Miles . ”
3641	3644	3645	3645	I	3245	“ Tristan , ”
3649	3656	3657	3657	she	1101	“ How can I help you ? ”
3668	3671	3672	3672	she	1101	“ Tristan ? ”
3676	3694	3672	3672	she	1101	“ I wanted to see if you would like to have dinner with me on Saturday night . ”
3724	3734	3712	3712	She	1101	“ You ’re asking me out on a date ? ”
3741	3758	3759	3759	She	1101	“ I do n’t like the way we met . I would like to start again . ”
3766	3790	3792	3792	she	1101	“ You have got to be kidding . I would n’t go out with you if you were the last man on earth . ”
3795	3807	3792	3792	she	1101	“ Money and looks do n’t impress me , Mr. Miles . ”
3818	3827	3808	3808	I	3245	“ Our meeting was nothing personal , Claire . ”
3828	3864	3869	3869	she	1101	“ It was very personal to me . Go and find a bimbo to wine and dine , Tristan . I have no interest in dating a cold , soul - sucking bastard like you . ”
3984	3996	3997	3997	Marley	100	“ I think this is going to be great for you , ”
4044	4083	4026	4026	I	3245	“ Marley , I can tell you straight up , right now , that if you think a motivational conference with all those crazies is going to help me , you are more insane than I ever realized . ”
4084	4128	4129	4129	I	3245	“ Stop it ; it ’s gon na be fantastic . You go away , regroup , and refocus , and you ’ll come back refreshed , and the company and your life and everything else is all going to fall into place . ”
4134	4153	4154	4154	she	297	“ Come on — can we at least agree that you need to change your mind - set ? ”
4164	4167	4158	4158	she	297	“ Possibly . ”
4173	4229	4168	4168	I	3245	“ And it ’s not your fault you ’re flat . You ’ve been through so much : your husband ’s unexpected death , caring for three boys , and struggling to keep the company afloat . It ’s been hell . And realistically you ’ve been fighting since Wade ’s death five years ago . ”
4230	4245	4246	4246	I	3245	“ Do you have to say it out loud ? Sounds even more depressing . ”
4258	4262	4263	4263	I	3245	“ Come in , ”
4275	4282	4271	4271	Gabriel	284	“ Ready for lunch , Missy ? ”
4289	4294	4283	4283	His	284	“ Hey , Marls . ”
4295	4298	4299	4299	She	297	“ Hi . ”
4308	4312	4303	4303	I	3245	“ Mr. Ferrara . ”
4319	4337	4313	4313	I	3245	“ You ’re early . Lunch is n’t for an hour . I thought you said two ? ”
4338	4354	4355	4355	I	3245	“ My meeting finished early , and I ’m hungry . Let ’s go now . ”
4482	4496	4497	4497	Marley	100	“ Gabe , tell Claire that she needs to go to this conference . ”
4510	4526	4527	4527	he	284	“ All right . . . Claire , you need to go to this conference , ”
4531	4540	4527	4527	he	284	“ Now let ’s eat . Sushi awaits . ”
4547	4604	4605	4605	I	3245	“ Can you just have a week off and go to Paris ? Take some time for yourself . Get away from the kids . I can look after everything back here at the office . We had that cash injection — things are okay around here for the moment . Use the time to recharge . ”
4739	4745	4746	4746	Marley	100	“ Go to the conference , ”
4750	4763	4746	4746	Marley	100	“ You are not going to lunch until you agree to this . ”
4764	4780	4781	4781	Gabriel	284	“ Hurry up , woman . Yes . It ’s agreed ; she ’s going . ”
4803	4818	4794	4794	he	284	“ You know I do n’t know how to do the motivational mumbo jumbo . ”
4828	4843	4819	4819	I	3245	“ The crap that they go on with is next - level batshit crazy . ”
4844	4864	4865	4865	Marley	100	“ I think you need some batshit crazy , because batshit broke is n’t a fun place to visit . ”
4872	4877	4878	4878	Gabriel	284	“ This is true . ”
4922	5011	4909	4909	I	3245	“ Go , recharge . It ’s in Épernay in the Champagne district of France , for fuck ’s sake . It does n’t get any more beautiful than this , Claire . It ’s a tax deduction ; you either pay for this or pay it in taxes — the choice is yours . At the very least , you can get a massage every afternoon and then drink two liters of champagne every night with your gourmet dinner and fall into bed in a blissful stupor . ”
5012	5017	5018	5018	Gabriel	284	“ Épernay is beautiful , ”
5023	5032	5018	5018	Gabriel	284	“ I would go just for the location . ”
5033	5039	5040	5040	I	3245	“ You ’ve been there ? ”
5044	5056	5057	5057	he	308	“ A few times . I went with Sophia last summer , ”
5060	5066	5057	5057	he	308	“ She loves it there . ”
5093	5108	5139	5139	Marley	100	“ Now , a gourmet dinner and champagne . . . that is tempting . ”
5109	5138	5139	5139	Marley	100	“ If the conference part of the trip is boring , just ditch it , and have a week to yourself in France . You need this break , ”
5145	5159	5160	5160	I	3245	“ Agreed . You ’re going . Hurry up ; I ’m ravenous . ”
5164	5172	5173	5173	Marley	100	“ Will you just go for me ? ”
5180	5183	5184	5184	She	310	“ Please . ”

10923	10958	10891	10891	he	3029	“ You have got to be kidding . I would n’t go out with you if you were the last man on earth . Money and looks do n’t impress me , Mr. Miles . ”
10959	10968	10891	10891	he	3029	“ Our meeting was nothing personal , Claire . ”
10969	11005	10891	10891	he	3029	“ It was very personal to me . Go and find a bimbo to wine and dine , Tristan . I have no interest in dating a cold , soul - sucking bastard like you . ”
11058	11062	11063	11063	I	3245	“ Claire Anderson . ”
11127	11131	11116	11116	He	3245	“ Please share . ”
11132	11138	11139	11139	I	3245	“ I beg your pardon . ”
11142	11150	11139	11139	I	3245	“ I did n’t hear the question . ”
11165	11188	11139	11139	I	3245	“ I asked everyone to recall a time when they felt satisfied . A time when they were really proud of themselves . ”
11189	11192	11193	11193	My	3245	“ Oh . ”
11197	11213	11214	11214	I	3245	“ And , judging by your grin , I ’m assuming you recalled something amazing . ”
11219	11222	11223	11223	He	3245	“ Please . ”
11233	11241	11242	11242	Asshole	55	“ Let us share in your pride . ”
11267	11274	11275	11275	he	3245	“ We ’re waiting , Claire , ”
11307	11340	11341	11341	I	3245	“ The last time I felt really satisfied was when I refused a date with a cold , soul - sucking bastard . Even if he was the last man on earth , ”
11367	11424	11425	11425	He	3245	“ Ah . . . but , Claire , how sad that the best thing you recall about your own life experiences is one that revolved around another . I think that says a lot more about you than it does him . I want a real answer this afternoon . Reflect on it until then . ”
11488	11492	11493	11493	He	3245	“ And besides . ”
11513	11540	11502	11502	he	3245	“ You ’ll probably be begging that soul - sucking bastard to ask you back out one day . . . not that he ever would . ”

12530	12536	12537	12537	He	90	“ Of course , yes . ”
12543	12550	12537	12537	He	90	“ I ’ll let them know . ”

13304	13355	13356	13356	she	473	“ I just really want to focus on my goals right now , and my ex just was n’t moving in the right circles — you know what I mean ? He wanted a house in the suburbs with three kids , and I want more from life than that , ”
13359	13366	13356	13356	she	473	“ I want a global empire . ”

13467	13474	13463	13463	She	473	“ Later , in my room . ”
13475	13480	13481	13481	I	3245	“ Ahh . . . ”
13487	13493	13494	13494	She	473	“ I mean . . . ”

13644	13659	13660	13660	She	100	“ Because I ’ve never seen a man so hit on in my life . ”
13664	13672	13673	13673	I	3245	“ The women you attract are shameless . ”
13721	13735	13713	13713	She	100	“ Trust me , Elouise ; it gets very boring after a while . ”
13885	13891	13892	13892	I	3245	“ Back in a moment , ”

14058	14061	14062	14062	She	100	“ Hello . ”
14076	14079	14080	14080	She	100	“ Hi . ”
14094	14100	14101	14101	I	3245	“ How was your massage ? ”

14122	14136	14117	14117	she	100	“ Are you going to look at me while I speak to you ? ”

14237	14240	14189	14189	she	100	“ Claire . ”
14241	14247	14223	14223	I	3245	“ Call me Mrs. Anderson . ”
14248	14256	14223	14223	I	3245	“ Why are you being so rude ? ”
14257	14276	14223	14223	I	3245	“ I ’m not being rude ; I ’m being honest . Would you prefer that I lie ? ”
14285	14288	14289	14289	I	3245	“ Maybe , ”
14292	14326	14327	14327	she	100	“ It ’s so lovely to see you , Tris . Let ’s hang out and sing ‘ Kumbaya ’ around a campfire . I ’ve missed your good looks and witty charm , ”

14446	14458	14404	14404	she	100	“ And I see you ’re still taking those bitch pills . ”
14459	14464	14465	14465	She	100	“ Ah , yes . ”
14468	14498	14499	14499	My	3245	“ Let ’s blame my distaste for you on meds , shall we ? There could n’t possibly be another reason why you repulse me , could there now ? ”
14515	14527	14505	14505	Women	391	“ Repulse is a rather strong word , is n’t it ? ”
14539	14551	14528	14528	I	3245	“ I think the word you meant to use is fascinate . ”
14570	14577	14578	14578	she	100	“ Go away , Mr. Miles , ”
14581	14589	14578	14578	she	100	“ Do I fascinate you , Claire ? ”
14590	14596	14597	14597	she	100	“ Call me Mrs. Anderson , ”

15167	15190	15164	15164	I	3245	“ I have no idea what his surname is , but I ’m pretty sure it ’s not Mandela , Mr. Miles . ”
15191	15200	15119	15119	He	90	“ I told you to call me Tristan . ”
15201	15210	15164	15164	I	3245	“ And I told you to go away . ”

15305	15314	15265	15265	he	90	“ Why do you hate me so much ? ”
15315	15325	15282	15282	I	3245	“ Well , there ’s a lot to dislike . ”
15326	15330	15282	15282	I	3245	“ Such as ? ”

15496	15512	15493	15493	I	3245	“ I think we both know who is coldhearted out of the two of us . ”
15525	15531	15520	15520	he	3245	“ What about your blood ? ”
15532	15538	15520	15520	he	3245	“ What about my blood ? ”
15539	15546	15547	15547	He	3245	“ Does your blood run hot ? ”
15578	15594	15571	15571	I	3245	“ I do n’t think you need to know about the temperature of my blood . ”
15595	15604	15605	15605	He	3245	“ Oh , but a man does wonder . ”
15622	15634	15635	15635	He	3245	“ Perhaps we should talk about it . . . outside . ”
15649	15657	15635	15635	He	3245	“ Off the clock , of course . ”
15658	15676	15681	15681	he	3245	“ You want to go outside and talk about the temperature of my blood , Mr. Miles ? ”

15822	15825	15812	15812	He	3245	“ What ? ”
15826	15836	15837	15837	I	3245	“ Do n’t be scared of calling me Tristan . ”
15842	15860	15861	15861	I	3245	“ Because one day very soon , I predict that you ’re going to be moaning it . ”
15864	15871	15861	15861	I	3245	“ Are you always this delusional ? ”
15872	15876	15877	15877	He	3245	“ Just saying . ”
15901	15907	15898	15898	Nelson	106	“ Here ’s your drink . ”

18981	19008	19009	19009	Elouise	100	“ They ’re so proud , and then I watch their little faces fall when they remember that their dad ’s not here to see it . ”
19013	19019	19020	19020	I	3245	“ So yeah . . . ”
19023	19034	19020	19020	I	3245	“ Little League is the hardest thing about my life . ”

19566	19578	19579	19579	He	3029	“ Do you want to go and get some granny tea ? ”
19633	19636	19637	19637	I	3245	“ No , ”
19640	19645	19637	19637	I	3245	“ I do not . ”

19695	19699	19700	19700	he	3029	“ What look ? ”
19703	19710	19711	19711	I	3245	“ That pathetic look of sympathy , ”
19714	19741	19742	19742	He	3029	“ You can look at me sexy ; you can look at me with distaste . But do n’t you fucking dare feel sorry for me . ”
19747	19764	19765	19765	He	3029	“ The one person in the world that I do n’t want pity from is you . ”
19769	19775	19765	19765	He	3029	“ What do you want ? ”
19776	19785	19786	19786	I	3245	“ I just want to be treated normal , ”
19789	19798	19786	19786	I	3245	“ Not like poor Claire Anderson the widow . ”
19808	19819	19799	19799	I	3245	“ Like a normal woman who you do n’t know . ”
19847	19862	19863	19863	He	3029	“ At least when you ’re an asshole , I know what to expect . ”
19893	19918	19885	19885	he	3029	“ Believe me , Claire Anderson . . . the last thing I feel when I look at you . . . is pity . ”
20026	20034	20021	20021	His	3029	“ What is that kiss , Anderson ? ”
20047	20057	20058	20058	His	3029	“ That ’s not a granny - tea kiss . ”
20082	20089	20090	20090	he	3029	“ That ’s a hungry kiss , ”
20144	20151	20152	20152	he	3029	“ Are you hungry , Claire ? ”
20285	20290	20291	20291	He	3029	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
20312	20319	20302	20302	I	3245	“ Will you just stop it ? ”
20320	20324	20351	20351	He	3029	“ Stop what ? ”
20325	20346	20347	20347	I	3245	“ I ’m not interested in you , Tristan . I will never be interested in you . Back off , ”
20359	20362	20351	20351	He	3029	“ What ? ”

20382	20387	20388	20388	I	3245	“ You ’re delusional , ”
20391	20399	20400	20400	He	3029	“ You want me ; admit it . ”
20417	20426	20407	20407	I	3245	“ Leave me the hell alone , Tristan . ”
20427	20432	20433	20433	he	3029	“ Get back here , ”
20436	20441	20433	20433	he	3029	“ Go to hell . ”
21115	21123	21104	21104	I	3245	“ Oh , he ’s a nice guy ”
21212	21221	21222	21222	he	3029	“ Do you need any help , Claire ? ”
21243	21248	21249	21249	I	3245	“ I ’m okay , ”
21252	21255	21249	21249	I	3245	“ Thanks . ”
21307	21318	21319	21319	he	3029	“ Are you coming to the wine tour this afternoon ? ”
21338	21345	21334	21334	He	3029	“ I ’ll see you then . ”
21574	21584	21585	21585	Jada	113	“ Let ’s keep going for dessert and port , ”
21588	21596	21585	21585	Jada	113	“ We ’ll go to the brewery . ”
21699	21705	21685	21685	I	3245	“ Is this seat taken ? ”
21725	21730	21709	21709	His	286	“ Be my guest . ”
21749	21755	21744	21745	the waiter	281	“ What will it be ? ”
21756	21767	21744	21745	the waiter	281	“ I ’ll have another glass of champagne , please . ”
21768	21771	21772	21772	His	286	“ Sure . ”
21778	21782	21772	21772	His	286	“ Another scotch ? ”
21783	21786	21787	21787	Tristan	3029	“ Please . ”
21801	21808	21809	21809	he	286	“ Took your time , Anderson , ”
21812	21818	21819	21819	He	286	“ What does that mean ? ”
21826	21831	21819	21819	He	286	“ It ’s ten p.m. ”
21832	21847	21848	21848	I	3245	“ Well , if it ’s too late to talk , I ’ll leave , ”
21856	21861	21862	21862	He	286	“ Sit . Down . ”
21865	21875	21862	21862	He	286	“ You ’re lucky it ’s a quiet night . ”
21900	21905	21906	21906	He	286	“ Who ’s lucky ? ”
21915	21919	21906	21906	He	286	“ To Épernay . ”
21920	21924	21925	21925	I	3245	“ To Épernay , ”
21967	21978	21959	21959	he	286	“ You should probably stop looking at me like that . ”
21991	21995	21959	21959	he	286	“ Like what ? ”
21996	22005	22006	22006	My	3245	“ Like you want to fucking eat me . ”
22010	22019	22006	22006	My	3245	“ That ’s very presumptuous , Mr. Miles . ”
22020	22025	22026	22026	I	3245	“ Call me Tristan . ”
22044	22053	22054	22054	I	3245	“ I ’ll call you whatever I like , ”
22083	22095	22096	22096	I	3245	“ What makes you think that I want to eat you ? ”
22106	22121	22099	22099	His	286	“ Because I want to eat you , and it ’s manners to reciprocate . ”
22128	22141	22146	22146	he	286	“ I do n’t have very good manners , I ’m afraid . ”
22163	22175	22146	22146	he	286	“ So . . . this martyr thing works for you ? ”
22176	22183	22146	22146	he	286	“ How am I a martyr ? ”
22184	22187	22188	22188	He	286	“ Well . ”
22192	22210	22188	22188	He	286	“ You keep telling me that you ’re not attracted to me , and yet . . . ”
22211	22216	22217	22217	I	3245	“ And yet what ? ”
22220	22228	22229	22229	he	286	“ And yet I can feel it , ”
22232	22240	22229	22229	he	286	“ Your body is calling for mine . ”
22251	22286	22287	22287	he	286	“ Every time I ’m close to you , I can sense our bodies talking to each other . Do n’t tell me you ca n’t feel it , because I know you can , ”
22306	22317	22318	22318	he	286	“ Are you going to give her what she needs ? ”
22340	22348	22329	22329	I	3245	“ I ’m afraid I ca n’t . ”
22349	22353	22321	22321	he	286	“ Why not ? ”
22354	22364	22329	22329	I	3245	“ Because you ’re not someone I . . . ”
22365	22368	22369	22369	he	286	“ Like ? ”
22385	22407	22374	22374	I	3245	“ Relax , Anderson ; you ’re not someone that I would like either . Do n’t get ahead of yourself . ”
22413	22426	22427	22427	he	286	“ But . . . what happens on tour stays on tour , ”
22474	22477	22463	22463	he	286	“ What ? ”
22481	22501	22478	22478	I	3245	“ Well , you do know that one day , we are inevitability going to . . . fuck . ”
22515	22527	22478	22478	I	3245	“ An attraction like this does n’t go away , Anderson . ”
22541	22561	22535	22535	he	286	“ So , as I see it . . . we can use the time away to our advantage . ”
22562	22565	22566	22566	I	3245	“ Or ? ”
22575	22620	22569	22569	His	286	“ Or we can go back to New York until I eventually wear you down — for then I will fuck you on your desk . It will be hard and wet and messy , and who knows who might walk in on us . ”
22630	22638	22621	22621	I	3245	“ You ’re so sure of yourself . ”
22639	22647	22648	22648	He	286	“ I always get what I want . ”
22657	22665	22648	22648	He	286	“ And what I want is you . ”
22672	22675	22648	22648	He	286	“ Why ? ”
22676	22702	22703	22703	He	286	“ You see . . . I could pretend that I like you and that I want to explore our friendship or some fucking bullshit . ”
22708	22718	22703	22703	He	286	“ Or I could just tell you the truth . ”

33876	33895	33896	33896	He	3029	“ Why you ’re such a dirty - talking cad . You had no discipline as a child . ”
33899	33912	33913	33913	He	3029	“ I bet you were all fucking your governesses in boarding school . ”
33923	33935	33913	33913	He	3029	“ Jameson was , actually , come to think of it . ”
33936	33939	33940	33940	I	3245	“ Really ? ”
33967	33988	33989	33989	I	3245	“ So now that you have me here , Mr. Miles , what are you going to do with me ? ”
33992	33995	33989	33989	I	3245	“ Hmm . ”
34001	34009	34010	34010	I	3245	“ The possibilities are endless , really . ”
34013	34021	34010	34010	I	3245	“ You have three options , Anderson . ”
34022	34025	34010	34010	I	3245	“ Yes . ”
34026	34037	34038	34038	I	3245	“ You can get your smart - ass mouth fucked . ”
34048	34067	34068	34068	I	3245	“ Or you can bend over , and I ’ll give my own version of the Eiffel Tower . ”
34085	34086	34088	34088	his	73	“ Or”—he
34092	34108	34109	34109	I	3245	shrugs—“I suppose I could take you out for dinner and dancing or something equally boring . ”
34121	34124	34115	34115	He	73	“ Well ? ”
34134	34145	34146	34146	He	73	“ I ’ll take dinner and dancing , thank you . ”
34151	34184	34146	34146	He	73	“ Ugh , I knew you were going to pick that one . You ’re boring . Why would you want to dance when you have the opportunity to suck my dick ? ”
34202	34205	34206	34206	He	73	“ What ? ”
34219	34232	34209	34209	I	3245	“ Tristan Miles , I have never met anyone quite like you . ”
34233	34236	34237	34237	He	73	“ Ditto . ”
34243	34247	34237	34237	He	73	“ A toast . ”
34263	34268	34269	34269	he	73	“ To swallowing semen , ”
34297	34304	34305	34305	He	73	“ You ’re head obsessed today . ”
34319	34331	34312	34312	his	73	“ That ’s because I ca n’t stop thinking about it . ”
34332	34335	34336	34336	I	3245	“ Tristan . ”
34352	34357	34343	34343	He	73	“ Yes , Claire . ”
34358	34372	34373	34373	He	73	“ Be a good boy , and you might get what you want . ”
34377	34389	34373	34373	He	73	“ Or be a bad boy , and take it anyway . ”
34634	34638	34639	34639	She	1101	“ Tell me . ”
34649	34656	34642	34642	she	1101	“ How are you still single ? ”
34678	34684	34685	34685	She	1101	“ How old are you ? ”
34688	34698	34685	34685	She	1101	“ How old do you want me to be ? ”
34699	34710	34711	34711	I	3245	“ You only say that if you ’re a prostitute . ”
34716	34739	34740	34740	Her	1101	“ How do you know I ’m not ? How do you know that Marley has n’t paid me to seduce you ? ”
34749	34757	34744	34744	she	1101	“ How much is she paying you ? ”
34758	34768	34769	34769	I	3245	“ There is n’t enough money in the world . ”
34780	34805	34775	34775	I	3245	“ Keeping you satisfied is a dirty job . I bit off more than I can chew . I ’m demanding a pay raise . ”
34853	34860	34861	34861	I	3245	“ She ’s not paying me , ”
34864	34872	34861	34861	I	3245	“ I ’m seducing her for free . ”
34881	34893	34873	34873	I	3245	“ And I ’m not chewing . It ’s all licking . ”
34937	34942	34943	34943	she	1101	“ Answer my question , ”
34946	34953	34943	34943	she	1101	“ I ’m thirty - four . ”
34954	34961	34962	34962	She	1101	“ And you ’re still single ? ”
34970	34976	34965	34965	she	1101	“ How is that possible ? ”
34982	34988	34989	34989	I	3245	“ I do n’t know . ”
34992	35005	34989	34989	I	3245	“ I ’ve had four serious relationships over the course of time . ”
35006	35014	34989	34989	I	3245	“ And they did n’t work out ? ”
35015	35018	34989	34989	I	3245	“ Nope . ”
35019	35023	34989	34989	I	3245	“ Why not ? ”
35024	35032	35033	35033	She	1101	“ You ’re very nosy , Anderson . ”
35036	35047	35048	35048	I	3245	“ I know . You ask me a question next . ”
35057	35066	35048	35048	I	3245	“ I ’ll start thinking of one now . ”
35076	35079	35080	35080	she	1101	“ Well ? ”
35084	35090	35080	35080	she	1101	“ Answer my question first . ”
35138	35162	35163	35163	She	1101	“ I do n’t know , to be honest . The girls I went out with were all beautiful — perfect , actually . ”
35168	35185	35163	35163	She	1101	“ But when push came to shove , I did n’t want to fight for it . ”
35186	35190	35163	35163	She	1101	“ Meaning what ? ”
35191	35208	35209	35209	I	3245	“ Well , as history repeats , I seem to have a time limit for relationships . ”
35215	35223	35209	35209	I	3245	“ Like a use - by date . ”
35224	35231	35232	35232	she	1101	“ A use - by date , ”
35235	35250	35251	35251	I	3245	“ What does that mean ? How many times you have sex with them ? ”
35258	35271	35272	35272	She	1101	“ No , not that . . . for God ’s sake . ”
35280	35298	35299	35299	I	3245	“ I seem to meet someone , and then we fall into a routine and . . . ”
35302	35305	35299	35299	I	3245	“ What ? ”
35306	35342	35343	35343	She	1101	“ She falls in love with me and wants to move in and have marriage and babies , and I , for some reason , find something wrong with her and begin to back off . ”
35347	35356	35357	35357	I	3245	“ I do n’t know what it is . ”
35362	35396	35357	35357	I	3245	“ I do n’t know why I ’m like this . The second girlfriend I had was probably the one . I adored her . Was sad for years when we broke up . ”
35397	35405	35413	35413	I	3245	“ But you did n’t love her ? ”
35406	35412	35413	35413	I	3245	“ I do n’t know . ”
35425	35431	35413	35413	I	3245	“ So she left you ? ”
35432	35439	35357	35357	I	3245	“ No . I left her . ”
35440	35461	35413	35413	I	3245	“ But if you were sad for years about it , why did n’t you just go back to her ? ”
35462	35469	35470	35470	She	748	“ I did n’t want to . ”
35477	35485	35473	35473	she	748	“ I mean , what is love ? ”
35504	35531	35497	35497	we	749	“ I mean , define being in love with someone , Anderson . Because I ca n’t ; for the life of me I ca n’t . ”
35532	35535	35536	35536	She	748	“ Well . ”
35542	35559	35560	35560	I	3245	“ I think it ’s just like having a best friend who you want to fuck . ”
35563	35568	35560	35560	I	3245	“ That sounds pervy . ”
35569	35575	35576	35576	She	748	“ It is a bit . ”
35586	35593	35579	35579	I	3245	“ What was your husband like ? ”
35599	35605	35606	35606	Her	748	“ He was . . . ”
35611	35620	35621	35621	Her	748	“ He was a great man . Proud . ”
35633	35640	35621	35621	Her	748	“ I miss him every day . ”
35648	35656	35657	35657	I	3245	“ What kind of wife were you ? ”
35669	35676	35660	35660	She	748	“ I was a great wife . ”
35677	35680	35681	35681	I	3245	“ Really ? ”
35685	35693	35694	35694	She	748	“ I find that hard to believe . ”
35697	35705	35694	35694	She	748	“ Maybe just an all right wife . ”
35706	35712	35713	35713	I	3245	“ And you have kids ? ”
35716	35724	35725	35725	I	3245	“ Uh - huh , three boys . ”
35731	35739	35725	35725	I	3245	“ I ca n’t actually believe that . ”
35740	35744	35745	35745	she	748	“ Why not ? ”
35748	35760	35745	35745	she	748	“ I ’ve never been with anyone who has kids before . ”
35761	35766	35725	35725	I	3245	“ What ? Never ? ”
35767	35770	35725	35725	I	3245	“ Nope . ”
35771	35775	35745	35745	she	748	“ Why not ? ”
35776	35806	35807	35807	She	748	“ I do n’t know . It ’s weird , come to think of it . I have a very specific type of woman that I ’m attracted to . ”
35818	35825	35807	35807	She	748	“ Wait , let me guess . ”
35846	35850	35840	35840	I	3245	“ Please do . ”
35851	35855	35856	35856	I	3245	“ Hot body . ”
35863	35866	35856	35856	I	3245	“ Young . ”
35867	35870	35871	35871	She	748	“ Affirmative . ”
35881	35887	35871	35871	She	748	“ I ’m saying blonde . ”
35888	35895	35896	35896	I	3245	“ You ’re nailing me here . ”
35899	35903	35904	35904	Her	748	“ Every time . ”
35910	35928	35904	35904	Her	748	“ So she has to be a natural blonde with a hot body and younger than you . ”
35929	35933	35871	35871	She	748	“ Pretty much . ”
35934	35943	35944	35944	I	3245	“ What else does she have to have ? ”
35952	35958	35944	35944	I	3245	“ I like trendy girls . ”
35959	35963	35964	35964	she	748	“ Trendy girls , ”
35967	35973	35964	35964	she	748	“ What does that mean ? ”
35974	35990	35944	35944	I	3245	“ I do n’t know why , but I like girls who are into fashion . ”
35991	35998	35999	35999	She	748	“ Like . . . models ? ”
36002	36021	35999	35999	She	748	“ No , not necessarily models , but girls who are into dressing nice and look after themselves . ”
36022	36025	36026	36026	I	3245	“ Handbags . ”
36032	36043	36026	36026	I	3245	“ You like girls who look good on your arm . ”
36044	36047	36048	36048	I	3245	“ Possibly . ”
36054	36064	36065	36065	She	748	“ Why , what do you like in men ? ”
36073	36079	36065	36065	She	748	“ I do n’t know . ”
36080	36086	36111	36111	I	3245	“ What do you mean ? ”
36087	36110	36111	36111	I	3245	“ I do n’t know what I like . I only had two boyfriends before Wade and then . . . you . ”
36125	36134	36117	36117	I	3245	“ And what did you like about me ? ”
36135	36138	36139	36139	She	748	“ Well . ”
36143	36150	36139	36139	She	748	“ I wanted to turn you . ”
36151	36155	36156	36156	I	3245	“ Turn me . ”
36168	36172	36159	36159	I	3245	“ Into what ? ”
36173	36177	36178	36178	I	3245	“ A motherfucker . ”
36189	36192	36193	36193	I	3245	“ What ? ”
36196	36218	36193	36193	I	3245	“ I want to go down in the history books as the woman who officially turned Tristan Miles into a motherfucker . ”
36261	36287	36288	36288	I	3245	“ If I had known how fun it was to fuck around with an aged duck , I would have been doing it long ago , ”
36318	36333	36309	36309	She	751	“ I ’ll have you know I ’m not even old , Mr. Miles . ”
36334	36340	36294	36294	She	751	“ How old are you ? ”
36341	36348	36349	36349	I	3245	“ I ’m thirty - eight . ”
36352	36360	36349	36349	I	3245	“ Only four years older than me . ”
36361	36372	36309	36309	She	751	“ Why , how old did you think I was ? ”
36373	36375	36378	36378	I	3245	“ At least”—I
36382	36384	36378	36378	I	3245	number—“sixty . ”
36385	36388	36389	36389	she	751	“ Tristan ! ”
36413	36427	36428	36428	she	751	“ Do n’t try and sweeten the last comment with those magic lips , ”
36446	36453	36454	36454	She	751	“ What about my magic tongue ? ”
36457	36468	36454	36454	She	751	“ Did you know I ’m good with my tongue ? ”
36499	36511	36514	36514	her	751	“ I am well aware of your strengths , Mr. Miles . ”
36567	36574	36560	36560	her	751	“ What ’s that look for ? ”
36589	36599	36578	36578	She	751	“ In all seriousness , Tris , thank you . ”
36600	36604	36578	36578	She	751	“ For what ? ”
36605	36617	36618	36618	I	3245	“ For making me remember what it feels like to laugh . ”
36645	36655	36633	36633	I	3245	“ Are you ready to go home , Anderson ? ”
36656	36664	36665	36665	I	3245	“ Yes , I am , motherfucker . ”
36676	36690	36665	36665	I	3245	“ And just by chance , you ’re a mother . How convenient . ”
36827	36830	36831	36831	she	1101	“ Tris , ”
36844	36849	36834	36834	she	1101	“ I need you . ”
36927	36932	36933	36933	she	1101	“ No , Tris , ”
36936	36942	36922	36922	she	1101	“ Stay inside of me . ”
36943	36953	36954	36954	I	3245	“ Just let me roll you over , baby . ”
36959	36969	36954	36954	I	3245	“ I ca n’t hold myself up any longer . ”
37008	37013	37014	37014	she	1101	“ That ’s better , ”
37173	37177	37178	37178	He	3029	“ Good morning . ”
37187	37190	37178	37178	He	3029	“ Morning . ”
37205	37213	37214	37214	I	3245	“ Why are you awake so early ? ”
37217	37227	37228	37228	he	3029	“ Been up for hours . Could n’t sleep , ”
37240	37244	37228	37228	he	3029	“ Why not ? ”
37245	37271	37272	37272	I	3245	“ All your snoring . It ’s like sleeping with a boar cuddling your back . It gives a new meaning to a wild night . ”
37286	37294	37295	37295	he	3029	“ What ’s your name on Instagram ? ”
37304	37307	37298	37298	he	3029	“ Huh ? ”
37314	37331	37308	37308	I	3245	“ I ’ve been looking for you for a good hour . What ’s your name ? ”
37332	37342	37343	37343	I	3245	“ You woke up early to stalk my Instagram ? ”
37346	37349	37350	37350	he	3029	“ Name , ”
37362	37369	37354	37354	he	3029	“ I have a private account . ”
37370	37373	37350	37350	he	3029	“ And ? ”
37374	37383	37384	37384	His	3029	“ And . . . it ’s private . ”
37391	37402	37384	37384	His	3029	“ You ’re not going to give it to me ? ”
37403	37406	37407	37407	I	3245	“ No . ”
37410	37441	37442	37442	He	3029	“ I have like fifty followers , and they are mostly family . It ’s me and my kids , personal stuff . Nothing exciting , I can assure you . ”
37449	37459	37460	37460	I	3245	“ What ? And I ca n’t see it ? ”
37466	37475	37460	37460	I	3245	“ Tristan , why would you want to ? ”
37485	37505	37476	37476	I	3245	“ It ’s just my kid stuff . Sports , birthdays , pets . . . crap like that . ”
37506	37536	37537	37537	I	3245	“ Well . . . maybe because I spent half the night inside your body , I assumed I would be able to see what your kids look like . ”
37543	37552	37537	37537	I	3245	“ No . You ca n’t , actually . ”
37562	37576	37553	37553	I	3245	“ My kids are off limits and not up for discussion with you . ”
37587	37593	37577	37577	I	3245	“ Trust me , Tristan , ”
37600	37616	37594	37594	I	3245	“ It ’s not like all your girlfriends ’ Instagram accounts . Stalk them instead . ”

42458	42461	42455	42455	He	3029	“ Tristan . ”
42476	42495	42470	42470	He	3029	“ The dirty weekend was just that . One weekend . I do n’t want anything with you . ”
42504	42513	42514	42514	he	3029	“ What are you talking about , Anderson ? ”

42571	42601	42558	42558	He	3029	“ Why would n’t we see each other when we get on so well ? That ’s the most ridiculous thing that ’s ever come out of your mouth . ”
42627	42634	42635	42635	She	100	“ Oh . . . sorry . ”
42652	42657	42640	42640	Tristan	3029	“ That ’s okay . ”
42663	42670	42658	42658	I	3245	“ What is it , Marley ? ”

42807	42813	42814	42814	he	3029	“ Thank you , Marley , ”
42834	42839	42840	42840	I	3245	“ Where were we ? ”
42850	42861	42862	42862	He	3029	“ Tris . We ca n’t see each other anymore . ”
42868	42871	42862	42862	He	3029	“ What ? ”
42872	42880	42862	42862	He	3029	“ We ca n’t see each other . ”
42881	42887	42862	42862	He	3029	“ You ’re dumping me ? ”
42888	42894	42895	42895	I	3245	“ Nobody is dumping anybody , ”
42899	42916	42895	42895	I	3245	“ I really , really like you . The guy I went away with was perfect . ”
42917	42927	42928	42928	he	3029	“ So why ca n’t we see each other ? ”
42931	42937	42928	42928	he	3029	“ Because of the obvious . ”
42938	42942	42943	42943	he	3029	“ Like what ? ”
42951	42984	42985	42985	He	3029	“ Tristan , because you are Tristan Miles , and I ’m too old for you . I have children and responsibilities , and you like young blondes who are into fashion . ”
42990	42999	42985	42985	He	3029	“ Do n’t be fucking funny , Anderson . ”
43000	43011	43012	43012	I	3245	“ I ’m not . You told me that yourself . ”
43019	43032	43012	43012	I	3245	“ Tris , if circumstances were different and you were . . . ”
43046	43076	43033	43033	I	3245	“ If you were older than me and say . . . had been divorced and had a few kids , we could maybe try and see each other . ”
43077	43080	43081	43081	he	3029	“ What ? ”
43085	43112	43081	43081	he	3029	“ You wo n’t see me because I do n’t have children ? That ’s fucking ridiculous , Anderson . Can you hear yourself right now ? ”
43113	43122	43123	43123	I	3245	“ Do n’t raise your voice at me , ”
43127	43138	43139	43139	He	3029	“ Shut up , and come to lunch with me . ”
43159	43162	43163	43163	I	3245	“ Tristan . ”
43168	43172	43166	43166	Jeez	622	“ Stop it . ”
43173	43190	43155	43155	he	3029	“ Do n’t tell me you do n’t like me , because I know you do . ”
43191	43205	43166	43166	Jeez	622	“ I do . I ’m not denying it . I adore you . ”
43206	43209	43166	43166	Jeez	622	“ So ? ”
43210	43222	43223	43223	He	3029	“ I do n’t like you . . . like that . ”
43236	43240	43241	43241	I	3245	“ Like what ? ”
43253	43265	43241	43241	I	3245	“ Tris , you are n’t exactly boyfriend material for me . ”
43266	43269	43270	43270	he	3029	“ What ? ”
43282	43292	43293	43293	he	3029	“ I ’m . . . not boyfriend material ? ”
43296	43306	43307	43307	I	3245	“ I ’m great fucking boyfriend material , Claire . ”
43321	43328	43316	43316	He	3029	“ No . You ’re not . ”
43329	43343	43344	43344	I	3245	“ If anyone around here is not partner material , it ’s you . ”
43362	43376	43352	43352	he	3029	“ You , Claire Anderson . . . are too old for me . ”
43377	43381	43316	43316	He	3029	“ I know . ”
43382	43384	43352	43352	he	3029	“ And you”—he
43387	43392	43352	43352	he	3029	me—“have too many children . ”
43393	43396	43352	43352	he	3029	“ Precisely . ”
43397	43412	43413	43413	I	3245	“ And I ’m not into kids . Especially when they are n’t mine . ”
43420	43425	43413	43413	I	3245	“ Like I said . ”
43426	43444	43352	43352	he	3029	“ And I do n’t want to be with someone who ca n’t be spontaneous , anyway . ”
43445	43452	43453	43453	I	3245	“ Good . You should n’t . ”
43456	43465	43466	43466	I	3245	“ Do n’t be fucking condescending , Anderson . ”
43471	43476	43466	43466	I	3245	“ Are you finished ? ”
43477	43484	43485	43485	he	3245	“ No . I ’m not , ”
43488	43494	43485	43485	he	3245	“ You piss me off . ”
43495	43500	43466	43466	I	3245	“ I gathered that . ”
43501	43505	43506	43506	I	3245	“ Stop it . ”
43538	43548	43530	43530	he	3245	“ You really are a beautiful man , Tris , ”
43557	43563	43552	43552	He	3245	“ You deserve the best . ”
43577	43624	43569	43569	I	3245	“ I ’m not her ; I ’m sorry . I wish I was . I really do . We are at different stages of our lives . You are just about to settle down and start a family , and I am finishing with mine . ”
43625	43629	43689	43689	he	3245	“ Stop talking . ”
43630	43656	43569	43569	I	3245	“ We both know that this is n’t going anywhere . I ’m not a casual - sex kind of person , and you are . ”
43657	43665	43666	43666	He	3245	“ Shut the fuck up , Anderson . ”
43683	43688	43689	43689	he	3245	“ One last time ? ”
43704	43707	43708	43708	He	3245	“ No . ”
43723	43732	43733	43733	His	3245	“ Let me fuck you on your desk . ”
43751	43768	43741	43741	I	3245	“ I told you I was going to do it . Right here , right now . ”
43769	43772	43773	43773	I	3245	“ Tristan . ”
43782	43811	43812	43812	He	3245	“ You gave me an option : France or my desk . I took France . You do n’t get the desk . Now you need to go . ”
43820	43828	43812	43812	He	3245	“ You ’re actually serious about this ? ”
43829	43832	43812	43812	He	3245	“ Yes . ”
43833	43844	43845	43845	He	3245	“ You do n’t want to see me ever again ? ”
43848	43851	43845	43845	He	3245	“ No . ”
43862	43870	43857	43857	He	3245	“ But we had the best weekend . ”
43871	43888	43889	43889	I	3245	“ I know . It completely sucks that you ’re a soul - sucking bastard player . ”
43899	43907	43908	43908	He	3245	“ Now , I need to work . ”
43916	43927	43928	43928	He	3245	“ This is the stupidest thing you ’ve ever done . ”
43941	43951	43952	43952	He	3245	“ You ’re missing out on some magical dick . ”
43957	43960	43952	43952	He	3245	“ Undoubtedly . ”
44036	44042	44043	44043	he	3245	“ Guess what , Anderson ? ”
44046	44049	44043	44043	he	3245	“ What ? ”
44053	44071	44072	44072	He	3245	“ We ’re not over . . . till . . . I say we ’re over . ”
44131	44136	44137	44137	Marley	100	“ Are you serious ? ”
44146	44155	44156	44156	she	100	“ What the fuck did I just see ? ”
44159	44162	44163	44163	I	3245	“ Nothing . ”
44168	44174	44163	44163	I	3245	“ Forget you saw it . ”
44175	44193	44156	44156	she	100	“ Claire Anderson . I demand to know what the hell is going on with that god . ”
44194	44208	44209	44209	I	3245	“ He ’s not a god . He ’s just a random guy . ”
44227	44246	44221	44221	He	842	“ And so how did it go from hating his guts to him groping you in your office ? ”
44259	44267	44251	44251	I	3245	“ He may have been in France . ”
44268	44272	44273	44273	she	844	“ No way , ”
44276	44286	44273	44273	she	844	“ We may have . . . hooked up . ”
44287	44291	44292	44292	She	844	“ Holy hell . ”
44302	44307	44292	44292	She	844	“ A little bit . ”
44308	44320	44321	44321	she	844	“ Ahh . . . get the fuck out of here , ”
44324	44331	44321	44321	she	844	“ Are you frigging kidding me ? ”
44332	44338	44344	44344	she	844	“ I wish I was . ”
44339	44343	44344	44344	she	844	“ What happened ? ”
44351	44358	44347	44347	she	844	“ I need all the details . ”
44367	44370	44371	44371	I	3245	“ Yes ? ”
44383	44395	44377	44377	Alexander	142	“ Do n’t forget we have that meeting in five minutes . ”
44396	44399	44400	44400	My	3245	“ Oh . ”
44411	44424	44425	44425	Alexander	142	“ Yes , of course . See you in the conference room . ”
44444	44471	44472	44472	She	844	“ I do n’t want to talk about it here . Let ’s finish work early today and go to a bar for a staff meeting . ”
44476	44489	44490	44490	Marley	100	“ Yes . We need to discuss Miles Media in great detail . ”
44543	44546	44538	44538	Marley	100	“ And ? ”
44547	44551	44572	44572	I	3245	“ And what ? ”
44552	44571	44572	44572	I	3245	“ Do n’t you hold out on me , Claire Anderson . I need all the fucking details . ”
44580	44585	44586	44586	I	3245	“ God , Marley , ”
44589	44596	44597	44597	She	849	“ It was like a movie . ”
44601	44634	44597	44597	She	849	“ I got to the conference , and he was the opening speaker . I went to walk out , and he said , ‘ Claire Anderson , sit back down . ’ ”
44639	44665	44635	44635	Her	849	“ Then we had banter for a few days , and I was still hating him . But surprisingly , he ’s witty and funny . ”
44666	44673	44674	44674	she	849	“ I knew he would be , ”
44677	44684	44674	44674	she	849	“ Smart guys are always witty . ”
44685	44701	44702	44702	She	849	“ Anyway , one night on the way back from dinner , he kissed me . ”
44713	44732	44702	44702	She	849	“ He wanted to come back to my room , and I said no and locked him out . ”
44733	44737	44738	44738	she	849	“ You idiot , ”
44741	44758	44759	44759	I	3245	“ Are you fucking crazy ? Have you seen the level of hotness of that guy ? ”
44771	44777	44766	44766	Her	849	“ Do n’t tell me . ”
44778	44781	44786	44786	she	849	“ Yep . ”
44782	44785	44786	44786	she	849	“ And ? ”
44789	44797	44798	44798	I	3245	“ Off - the - hook hot , ”
44810	44822	44801	44801	She	849	“ You had sex . . . with Tristan fucking Miles ? ”
44823	44831	44832	44832	I	3245	“ Shh , keep your voice down , ”
44844	44861	44862	44862	She	849	“ Yes . A lot of sex . In fact , I fucked his brains out . ”
44872	44879	44862	44862	She	849	“ What the hell , Claire ? ”
44880	44884	44885	44885	I	3245	“ I know . ”
44890	44920	44921	44921	She	849	“ But then he came into the conference and said that he had to leave unexpectedly and said goodbye to the group and did n’t say goodbye to me . ”
44924	44933	44921	44921	She	849	“ What ? I ’m confused . . . ”
44934	44964	44965	44965	Her	849	“ But then I got back to my room , and there were red roses and a card asking me to go to Paris for the weekend with him . ”
44969	44985	44965	44965	Her	849	“ Fuck , this story is just getting better and better . Did you go ? ”
44986	44989	44990	44990	Her	849	“ Yes . ”
44998	45001	45002	45002	she	849	“ And ? ”
45017	45028	45005	45005	I	3245	“ It was incredible . We had the best time . ”
45029	45039	45040	45040	She	849	“ Oh my God , this is . . . ”
45053	45067	45045	45045	she	849	“ But today , he showed up unexpectedly , and I ended it . ”
45068	45071	45072	45072	She	849	“ What ? ”
45078	45081	45072	45072	She	849	“ Why ? ”
45082	45099	45100	45100	She	849	“ Oh , come on , Marley . We both know it ’s not going anywhere . ”
45105	45146	45100	45100	She	849	“ He ’s young and handsome and a player . I ’m in bed at nine o clock on Saturday night , dead tired . He does n’t do long term , and I ca n’t really do anything else . ”
45147	45150	45072	45072	She	849	“ So ? ”
45151	45154	45155	45155	I	3245	“ No . ”
45159	45197	45155	45155	I	3245	“ He ’s beautiful , but he ’s at a stage where he is going to want to settle down soon , and I ’m not the person . We are at different stages of our life . ”
45198	45211	45212	45212	she	849	“ Why ca n’t you just fuck him for fun , Claire ? ”
45216	45221	45212	45212	she	849	“ Because . . . ”
45231	45243	45222	45222	I	3245	“ You know , I realized something about myself this weekend . ”
45244	45249	45155	45155	I	3245	“ What ’s that ? ”
45250	45268	45269	45269	She	849	“ I quite liked having someone there , you know . Talking , laughing , having sex . ”
45276	45286	45269	45269	She	849	“ And I might want to pursue dating again . ”
45287	45296	45320	45320	I	3245	“ Why ca n’t you just date Tristan ? ”
45297	45319	45320	45320	I	3245	“ Tristan does n’t date . All he would do is tie me up so I do n’t meet anyone else . ”
45335	45406	45407	45407	Marley	100	“ Perhaps if he were older and had a few kids with another woman , I would follow it up . But we are at different stages of life , and I ’m not holding him or myself back by pursuing something that will never go anywhere . Trust me ; this is shitty for me , too , but he is n’t someone I want to date long term . ”
45411	45423	45407	45407	Marley	100	“ Yeah , I guess you ’re right . Fair enough . ”
45434	45500	45424	45424	I	3245	“ One weekend was enough , and you know what ? It did the trick . I feel like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders , and for the first time in a long time , I ’m kind of looking forward to what the future may bring . Thank you so much for making me go . Honestly it was so needed . ”

45529	45533	45534	45534	I	3245	“ Ridiculously so . ”
45537	45562	45563	45563	Marley	100	“ He has a body built to please a woman . I did n’t know that virile men like him existed in real life . ”
45572	45588	45589	45589	she	100	“ God , he ’s so hot . . . I ca n’t stand it , ”
45592	45596	45597	45597	I	3245	“ I know . ”
45600	45634	45635	45635	Marley	100	“ He really is . And fun , so fun . Honestly I ’ve never been with a man who is so fun . I was in an orgasm high the entire weekend . ”
45644	45661	45635	45635	Marley	100	“ Maybe he could just fuck me for a while to take his mind off you . ”
45672	45689	45690	45690	she	100	“ I ’m not joking , Claire . I need some fucking fun in my life , ”
45694	45708	45690	45690	she	100	“ I ’m having a fun famine . It ’s depressing , actually . ”
45709	45715	45716	45716	I	3245	“ Tristan is off limits . ”
45728	45741	45723	45723	She	100	“ You ’re such a spoilsport . He was totally into me . ”
45742	45749	45750	45750	I	3245	“ I do n’t doubt it . ”
45753	45760	45750	45750	I	3245	“ Tristan Miles is into everybody . ”
46070	46075	46076	46076	he	1305	“ What is this ? ”
46088	46091	46079	46079	he	1305	“ Huh ? ”
46113	46118	46119	46119	Fletcher	1305	“ What are these ? ”
46139	46148	46149	46149	I	3245	“ What are you talking about , Fletcher ? ”
46152	46164	46165	46165	he	1305	“ Whose jocks are these that I found in your suitcase ? ”
46184	46208	46209	46209	My	3245	“ Yes , Mom . Who left their damn underwear in your suitcase , and what exactly were you doing in fucking France ? ”
46214	46243	46209	46209	My	3245	“ Do not use that language with me , young man . How dare you ? What were you doing looking through my suitcase ? You ’re grounded . ”
46244	46251	46252	46252	he	1305	“ You ’re grounded , Mom , ”
46255	46265	46252	46252	he	1305	“ What the hell were you doing in France ? ”
46285	46300	46280	46280	he	1305	“ Did you even go to France , or was that a lie too ? ”
46306	46315	46316	46316	I	3245	“ You self - centered little . . . ”
46326	46331	46320	46320	I	3245	“ How dare you . ”
46332	46345	46346	46346	he	1305	“ Oh , I dare , all right . Who is he ? ”
46349	46361	46346	46346	he	1305	“ I ’m going to kill him with my bare hands . ”
46398	46403	46404	46404	he	1305	“ I mean it , ”
46407	46413	46404	46404	he	1305	“ I want his name . ”

48286	48292	48293	48293	Patrick	372	“ His name is Harry , ”
48296	48305	48293	48293	Patrick	372	“ Yeah , well , Harry is psychotic , ”

49382	49392	49371	49371	she	1101	“ He had a momentary slipup with his temper . ”
49393	49419	49431	49431	she	1101	“ Yeah , I was there , Claire . I saw it , remember ? Firsthand , actually . Have the ankle to prove it . ”
49420	49430	49431	49431	she	1101	“ Anyway , he wants to speak to you , ”

49510	49519	49520	49520	I	3245	“ I could have you charged with assault , ”
49527	49552	49523	49523	He	934	“ I ’m just your mother ’s friend from work . You jumped to the wrong conclusion . It was completely out of line . ”
49556	49560	49561	49561	I	3245	“ Anything else ? ”
49566	49569	49561	49561	I	3245	“ Nope . ”

49600	49606	49578	49578	I	3245	“ Are you really sorry ? ”
49607	49610	49611	49611	I	3245	“ No . ”
49660	49670	49671	49671	he	3245	“ Do you want to speak to Mom again ? ”
49694	49705	49691	49691	I	3245	“ No , that ’s okay . Thanks for calling . ”
49854	49860	49847	49847	he	73	“ What happened to you ? ”
49861	49866	49867	49867	I	3245	“ Do n’t ask . ”
49875	49881	49867	49867	I	3245	“ What have you done ? ”
49882	49896	49897	49897	He	73	“ Torn ligaments . Pulled a piece of bone off when it snapped . ”
49900	49909	49897	49897	He	73	“ Ouch . How did you do that ? ”
49918	49927	49910	49910	I	3245	“ A kid beat me up with underpants . ”
49928	49932	49933	49933	I	3245	“ He what ? ”
49943	49954	49933	49933	I	3245	“ I went to the twilight zone yesterday , Jameson . ”
49955	49959	49910	49910	I	3245	“ How so ? ”
49960	49977	49978	49978	He	73	“ Let me set the tone of the kind of people I ’m dealing with here . ”
49983	49991	49992	49992	I	3245	“ They have a cat called Muff , ”
50001	50024	49995	49995	He	73	“ What kind of deranged , sick , fucked - up , twisted person calls a family pussy . . . Muff ? ”
50025	50032	50033	50033	He	73	“ What are you talking about ? ”
50036	50048	50049	50049	I	3245	“ So I met this chick at the conference in France . ”
50053	50058	50059	50059	He	73	“ She was perfect . ”
50064	50069	50070	50070	he	73	“ Here we go , ”
50074	50093	50070	50070	he	73	“ Ticked boxes that I did n’t even know existed . Smart and funny . Hot as fuck . ”
50100	50111	50112	50112	He	73	“ Small problem , though — she has three kids . ”
50115	50148	50149	50149	I	3245	“ So we get back here . She tells me she ’s ending it because of her kids . Saying that we come from different worlds , blah , blah , blah . ”
50168	50185	50154	50154	Jameson	73	“ I do n’t believe her reasoning , so I followed her home from work yesterday . ”
50186	50194	50195	50195	He	73	“ What ? You followed her home ? ”
50201	50233	50198	50198	I	3245	“ Little bit . Well , Sammia found her address , actually . Anyway , I get to her house . It ’s like a junkyard ; there ’s shit everywhere . ”
50250	50264	50265	50265	He	73	“ Shoes and bikes and fuck . . . everything under the sun . ”
50272	50287	50268	50268	he	73	“ So her kid comes rushing out , but he is n’t a kid . ”
50292	50301	50268	50268	he	73	“ He ’s a fucking man - child . ”
50313	50330	50331	50331	Jameson	73	“ He starts whipping me with a pair of underpants that I left in her suitcase . ”
50340	50360	50361	50361	Jameson	73	“ So I step back in shock , tread on a skateboard , and go flying down the stairs . ”
50364	50386	50387	50387	Jameson	73	“ Only to have that crazy motherfucking kid jump on me and try to shove my own underpants in my mouth . ”
50397	50402	50403	50403	I	3245	“ There ’s more , ”
50406	50415	50416	50416	Jameson	73	“ That ’s not even the worst part . ”
50422	50451	50416	50416	Jameson	73	“ They take me inside . She sends that child to his room , and then she goes to get ice , and then another kid comes out . ”
50462	50479	50452	50452	I	3245	“ This kid . . . is fucking evil , man , I ’m telling you . ”
50480	50486	50487	50487	I	3245	“ What ’s his name ? ”
50493	50508	50509	50509	I	3245	“ Same as that nerdy wizard kid . . . the one with glasses . ”
50519	50525	50509	50509	I	3245	“ Who ? Harry Potter ? ”
50526	50538	50539	50539	Jameson	73	“ Yes , that ’s it . His name is Harry . ”
50543	50553	50554	50554	Jameson	73	“ He starts slicing his neck with his finger . ”
50560	50580	50581	50581	I	3245	“ Then he puts his hands around his throat and begins to choke himself until he fakes his death , ”
50584	50587	50588	50588	Jameson	73	“ What ? ”
50594	50599	50588	50588	Jameson	73	“ That is weird . ”
50600	50606	50607	50607	I	3245	“ Oh , you think ? ”
50610	50643	50607	50607	I	3245	“ Then he runs away and comes back with a tie thing and a teddy bear , and I watch as he ties a noose around its neck and then hangs it . ”
50662	50667	50654	50654	He	73	“ He did what ? ”
50676	50688	50689	50689	Jameson	73	“ As God is my witness . This shit really happened . ”
50696	50701	50702	50702	I	3245	“ And the dog , ”
50705	50711	50702	50702	I	3245	“ The poor fucking dog . ”
50712	50720	50689	50689	Jameson	73	“ What ’s wrong with the dog ? ”
50721	50733	50702	50702	I	3245	“ They have a fucking bucket thing tied to its head . ”
50734	50738	50702	50702	I	3245	“ What for ? ”
50739	50749	50750	50750	His	73	“ To torture it . . . why else ? ”
50760	50763	50755	50755	he	73	“ What ? ”
50764	50811	50812	50812	Jameson	73	“ I ’m not even joking . . . I got out to the car and considered going back in on a mercy mission and stealing the poor bastard to save it . He was eating peas , Jameson . Fucking peas , I tell you . ”
50829	50836	50821	50821	I	3245	“ I ’m sorry , Woofy . ”
50837	50843	50844	50844	I	3245	“ His name is Woofy ? ”
50858	50864	50848	50848	He	73	“ What did you do ? ”
50869	50886	50865	50865	I	3245	“ I did what any self - respecting man does when his life is in danger . ”
50887	50892	50848	50848	He	73	“ What ’s that ? ”
50893	50902	50865	50865	I	3245	“ I got the fuck out of there . ”
50903	50911	50912	50912	he	73	“ You drove home with that ankle ? ”
50917	50923	50924	50924	Jameson	73	“ Sped the entire way . ”
50928	50935	50936	50936	I	3245	“ No more MILFs for me . ”
50944	50949	50936	50936	I	3245	“ I ’m done . ”
50956	50976	50950	50950	I	3245	“ In fact , I do n’t even think I want kids now . I ’m scarred for life . ”
50983	51007	51008	51008	Jameson	73	“ You know , I knew she was a widow and had it tough , but I never imagined it was this bad . ”
51012	51024	51008	51008	Jameson	73	“ She was probably thinking of you when she ended it . ”
51025	51031	51032	51032	I	3245	“ Yeah , I guess . ”
51035	51056	51032	51032	I	3245	“ Anyway , in another life she ’s the perfect woman . It ’s her circumstances that have fucked it . ”
51073	51077	51066	51066	someone	2335	“ Come in . ”
51111	51120	51099	51099	She	144	“ Tris , your intern interviews are here . ”
51125	51137	51121	51121	I	3245	“ Okay , what number did we narrow it down to ? ”
51138	51162	51099	51099	She	144	“ With all the testing and the two interviews they have already done down on level forty , there are three final candidates . ”
51163	51174	51175	51175	I	3245	“ Yes , okay , which one do you like ? ”
51178	51183	51184	51184	she	144	“ I like Rebecca , ”
51187	51196	51184	51184	she	144	“ I think she has what it takes . ”
51197	51221	51222	51222	I	3245	“ Well , to get this far , they all have what it takes , but let ’s see who interviews the best . ”
51283	51302	51303	51303	I	3245	“ To be honest I have n’t even had time to go through any of the interview notes , ”
51306	51311	51303	51303	I	3245	“ That ’s okay . ”
51315	51326	51327	51327	I	3245	“ It ’s not like it ’s your first rodeo . ”
51330	51337	51327	51327	I	3245	“ Send the first one in . ”
51338	51341	51342	51342	I	3245	“ Okay . ”
51373	51377	51383	51383	I	3245	“ Come in . ”
51410	51419	51420	51420	he	3245	“ You ’re . . . Tristan Miles ? ”
51425	51431	51432	51432	I	3245	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
51435	51458	51432	51432	I	3245	“ I ca n’t even fucking walk because of you , and now you turn up here looking for a damn job ? ”
51459	51471	51472	51472	he	3245	“ Trust me . I did n’t know it was you , ”
51476	51485	51486	51486	I	3245	“ Or you would n’t have attacked me ? ”
51489	51506	51486	51486	I	3245	“ No , I would have still attacked you ; I would n’t have come today . ”
51515	51521	51486	51486	I	3245	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
51531	51540	51522	51522	He	3245	“ So . . . you were lying . ”
51541	51545	51522	51522	He	3245	“ About what ? ”
51546	51558	51522	51522	He	3245	“ You do n’t know my mother from work at all . ”
51559	51577	51522	51522	He	3245	“ Yes , I do , and why the hell are we talking about your mother now ? ”
51578	51601	51522	51522	He	3245	“ Why did you come to my house to see her ? Why did n’t you just see her at her office ? ”
51602	51609	51610	51610	I	3245	“ First of all . . . ”
51616	51620	51610	51610	I	3245	“ Sit down , ”
51642	51691	51692	51692	He	951	“ Second of all , last time I looked , it ’s your mother ’s house . And thirdly , it ’s none of your business why I wanted to talk to her . My ankle is completely fucked , by the way ; thank you for asking . ”
51695	51702	51692	51692	He	951	“ You think this is funny ? ”
51703	51738	51739	51739	I	3245	“ No , I think you ’re a lying jerk . They were totally your underpants , and you can stick your job up your entitled ass . I do n’t want it anyway . ”
51753	51757	51746	51746	I	3245	“ I will . ”
51764	51776	51777	51777	I	3245	“ Do n’t tell my mom that I came here today . ”
51780	51786	51777	51777	I	3245	“ She does n’t know ? ”
51787	51802	51777	51777	I	3245	“ No , and I would appreciate it if she did n’t find out . ”
51803	51811	51777	51777	I	3245	“ Why did n’t you tell her ? ”
51812	51825	51826	51826	I	3245	“ I was going to surprise her if I got the job . ”
51836	51857	51858	51858	His	951	“ Why would n’t you tell her you were going for this ? Applications have been going on for months . ”
51865	51881	51858	51858	His	951	“ I did n’t want her to be disappointed when I did n’t get it . ”
51882	51903	51904	51904	His	951	“ She would n’t be disappointed if you did n’t get the job . I know that for a fact . ”
51918	51926	51927	51927	I	3245	“ Why would you want this job ? ”
51930	51944	51945	51945	He	951	“ I want to learn what to do and take over Anderson Media . ”
51948	51959	51960	51960	I	3245	“ So she does n’t have to work so hard . ”
51965	51970	51971	51971	He	951	“ She does enough . ”
51979	51991	51971	51971	He	951	“ I do n’t want her to have to worry anymore . ”
51996	52006	51971	51971	He	951	“ You think you have to protect your mother ? ”
52007	52018	52019	52019	He	951	“ I do n’t think it ; I know it . ”
52022	52027	52028	52028	He	951	“ It ’s okay . ”
52032	52040	52041	52041	He	951	“ I wo n’t waste your time . ”
52082	52088	52089	52089	he	951	“ Sorry about your ankle , ”
52092	52097	52089	52089	he	951	“ Are you really ? ”
52098	52101	52102	52102	He	951	“ Nope . ”
52107	52130	52102	52102	He	951	“ Do n’t tell me you would n’t do the same if you found someone ’s underwear in your mother ’s bag . ”
52131	52140	52141	52141	I	3245	“ No , actually , I would n’t , ”
52145	52155	52156	52156	He	951	“ Because . . . I ’m not psychotic . ”
52161	52164	52165	52165	He	951	“ Whatever . ”
52171	52179	52180	52180	I	3245	“ Intern interviewees usually shake my hand , ”
52185	52190	52191	52191	He	951	“ Not this one . ”
52224	52235	52219	52219	I	3245	“ Sammia , send in the second interview , please . ”
52236	52240	52241	52241	My	3245	“ Sure thing . ”
52682	52690	52691	52691	I	3245	“ Read that line again , Paddy , ”
52694	52712	52713	52713	He	372	“ The house was in the ha . . . ha . . . ha . . . ”
52719	52724	52725	52725	I	3245	“ Sound it out , ”
52729	52736	52737	52737	He	372	“ Ham - p - tons . ”
52745	52752	52737	52737	He	372	“ Yes , you got it . ”
52836	52842	52843	52843	He	372	“ All al . . . ”
52846	52849	52850	52850	he	372	“ Long , ”
52865	52868	52869	52869	I	3245	“ What ? ”
52876	52886	52869	52869	I	3245	“ I ’ve decided that I ’m deferring university . ”
52897	52905	52869	52869	I	3245	“ Well , that ’s not happening . ”
52906	52927	52869	52869	I	3245	“ Yes , it is . I ’m eighteen next month , Mom . I can do what I like . ”
52928	52954	52869	52869	I	3245	“ Fletcher Anderson , you are way too smart to have a year off doing nothing . I ’m not even discussing this with you . ”
52955	52961	52869	52869	I	3245	“ I got an internship . ”
52966	52972	52869	52869	I	3245	“ What do you mean ? ”
52973	52987	52869	52869	I	3245	“ I applied six months ago and made it to the final three . ”
52988	52991	52992	52992	I	3245	“ What ? ”
52997	53005	52992	52992	I	3245	“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
53006	53018	53019	53019	I	3245	“ I did n’t want you to get your hopes up . ”
53029	53042	53019	53019	I	3245	“ Fletch , when are you going to stop worrying about me ? ”
53048	53056	53019	53019	I	3245	“ So when is the final interview ? ”
53057	53063	53064	53064	My	3245	“ I already had it . ”
53069	53074	53064	53064	My	3245	“ What ? When ? ”
53075	53082	53083	53083	I	3245	“ Wednesday , in New York . ”
53088	53098	53083	53083	I	3245	“ How did you do this without me knowing ? ”
53099	53122	53123	53123	I	3245	“ Caught the train . Anyway , I did n’t think I had a chance after Monday and the way we met . ”
53131	53137	53123	53123	I	3245	“ What do you mean ? ”
53138	53145	53083	53083	I	3245	“ It ’s with Miles Media . ”
53146	53155	53156	53156	I	3245	“ You got an internship with Miles Media ? ”
53159	53162	53163	53163	He	372	“ Yep . ”
53167	53175	53163	53163	He	372	“ Tristan Miles is my new boss . ”
53182	53187	53188	53188	I	3245	“ What ? No , ”
53191	53199	53188	53188	I	3245	“ You ca n’t work with him . ”
53211	53215	53188	53188	I	3245	“ Forget it . ”
53216	53247	53261	53261	I	3245	“ Mom , they ’re the best media company in the world . It ’s a big deal for me to get this . They had over four thousand applicants . ”
53248	53260	53261	53261	I	3245	“ You tried to shove underpants in his mouth , Fletcher , ”
53264	53279	53261	53261	I	3245	“ How can you walk into that office and not be ashamed of yourself ? ”
53280	53290	53261	53261	I	3245	“ It ’s okay . I apologized , remember ? ”
53291	53326	53327	53327	Fletcher	1305	“ No , it ’s not okay . It will never be okay . It ’s the most embarrassing thing I ’ve ever witnessed . You ca n’t work there ; I forbid it . ”
53365	53369	53370	53370	he	1305	“ I am , ”
53373	53380	53370	53370	he	1305	“ You ca n’t stop me . ”
53381	53388	53389	53389	I	3245	“ I can and I will , ”
53392	53416	53389	53389	I	3245	“ I want to learn from the best . I want to run Anderson Media one day ; they can teach me how . ”
53417	53434	53370	53370	he	1305	“ All they are going to teach you , Fletcher , is how to be ruthless . ”
53435	53446	53447	53447	I	3245	“ And that ’s exactly what I want to learn . ”
53452	53472	53447	53447	I	3245	“ You call Tristan Miles back and tell him to stick his job where the sun does n’t shine . ”
53786	53792	53793	53793	Fletcher	1305	“ I start on Monday , ”
53796	53802	53793	53793	Fletcher	1305	“ Over my dead body . ”
53811	53827	53805	53805	I	3245	“ Now remember , ask for help if you do n’t know what to do . ”
53828	53833	53834	53834	I	3245	“ Yes , Mom . ”
53872	53895	53896	53896	He	970	“ And make sure you drink lots of water . If you get dehydrated , you wo n’t be able to concentrate . ”
53901	53927	53896	53896	He	970	“ Now , I ’ve packed you a lunch . Do n’t get into the habit of buying it . You will waste a fortune . ”
53928	53931	53932	53932	Fletcher	1305	“ Mom . ”
53941	53997	53932	53932	Fletcher	1305	“ Because . . . you know ? What you start doing in this first job will lay the foundation for your entire working career . I want you to build good habits . This is an opportunity to learn , Fletch . Watch and learn , but always remember that you are an Anderson . ”
54012	54016	54006	54006	He	970	“ I will . ”
54017	54031	54032	54032	I	3245	“ Being smart in business does n’t mean you have to be cutthroat , ”
54036	54045	54046	54046	He	970	“ I know ; we talked about this . ”
54049	54066	54067	54067	He	970	“ Your father was such a good man , Fletch , with the highest of morals . ”
54100	54105	54090	54090	My	3245	“ Mom . Stop . ”
54122	54137	54114	54114	I	3245	“ I ’m sorry , honey . I ’m just so nervous for you . ”
54138	54141	54090	54090	My	3245	“ Why ? ”
54142	54161	54114	54114	I	3245	“ Because this is a big deal , and I do n’t want you to mess it up . ”
54162	54165	54166	54166	He	970	“ Mom . ”
54169	54201	54166	54166	He	970	“ I stuffed underpants in the boss ’s mouth before I even got the job . I ’m pretty sure I ’ve already messed it up as much as physically possible . ”
54212	54233	54202	54202	I	3245	“ God , please do n’t remind me . That will forever be the most mortifying moment of my life . ”
54246	54250	54251	54251	I	3245	“ Worked out . ”
54254	54260	54251	54251	I	3245	“ What does that mean ? ”
54261	54269	54270	54270	He	970	“ Well , he never came back . ”
54273	54319	54270	54270	He	970	“ We were just friends , Fletcher . He was never coming back anyway . . . long before you did that . Do n’t flatter yourself . If he and I were actually a thing , do you really think that would deter him ? ”
54320	54323	54324	54324	He	970	“ Hmm . ”
54428	54435	54436	54436	I	3245	“ Just remember to be professional , ”
54440	54444	54436	54436	I	3245	“ I know . ”
54445	54451	54452	54452	He	970	“ And use your manners . ”
54457	54470	54452	54452	He	970	“ And if you get into trouble , what do you do ? ”
54471	54485	54486	54486	He	970	“ Go to the bathroom , and count to ten to calm down . ”
54497	54504	54489	54489	I	3245	“ That ’s it , Fletch . ”
54511	54519	54520	54520	I	3245	“ You ’re going to be great . ”
54532	54540	54527	54527	he	970	“ That ’s enough already , Mom . ”
54556	54570	54571	54571	He	970	“ Do you know how proud your father and I are of you ? ”
54575	54578	54579	54579	I	3245	“ Thanks . ”
54582	54591	54579	54579	I	3245	“ And call me on your lunch break . ”
54592	54609	54579	54579	I	3245	“ Oh my God . Stop nagging me . I ’m not going to have time . ”
54610	54619	54625	54625	he	970	“ One minute — you have one minute . ”
54637	54642	54630	54630	I	3245	“ Let ’s go . ”
54663	54675	54676	54676	I	3245	“ It ’s one thirty p.m. Why has n’t he called ? ”
54679	54684	54685	54685	Marley	100	“ He probably forgot , ”
54688	54698	54699	54699	I	3245	“ What if they did n’t give him lunch ? ”
54702	54714	54715	54715	Marley	100	“ He ca n’t handle not eating . He might faint . ”
54720	54748	54715	54715	Marley	100	“ It will be fine , and it is n’t a prison camp . Miles Media has one of the best reputations for treating their staff well . ”
54749	54763	54764	54764	I	3245	“ Will you stop telling me that everything is going to be okay ? ”
54767	54785	54764	54764	I	3245	“ Because I have a reason to be concerned , and I ’m really worried about him . ”
54786	54804	54715	54715	Marley	100	“ Oh my God , you ’re driving yourself crazy — and me , for that matter . ”
54805	54832	54715	54715	Marley	100	“ When you have a child who is going to work for the biggest bastard in the world , you let me know how you go . ”
54833	54838	54839	54839	She	975	“ Okay , fine . ”
54844	54866	54867	54867	I	3245	“ This would n’t have anything to do with the fact that Mr. Miles has n’t called you , would it ? ”
54875	54964	54965	54965	Marley	100	“ What , as if I ’m annoyed that he has n’t call me ? I had already broken it off with him — not that we actually had anything to break off . It was just one week , Marley , and besides , Tristan Miles means nothing to me . But I have serious suspicions as to why he would ’ve hired Fletcher in the first place . Something feels off . Fletcher tried to bash him with his own underpants , for God ’s sake . ”
54968	54992	54993	54993	I	3245	“ Oh Lord , how I wish I was there to see that . I bet Tristan Miles has never had that before . ”
55031	55052	55053	55053	I	3245	“ I ’m just gon na text him . I ca n’t be going crazy like this for any longer . ”
55094	55118	55119	55119	I	3245	“ Oh no , Marley . This is going to be worse than him not even starting . I can just see it . ”
55155	55168	55169	55169	Marley	100	“ What ’s happening over there ? I do n’t believe this . ”
55174	55195	55169	55169	Marley	100	“ I do , actually . Let ’s face it , Claire . Fletcher does n’t exactly take orders well . ”
55204	55212	55213	55213	Marley	100	“ Hopefully his afternoon will be better . ”
55216	55248	55249	55249	I	3245	“ It will be . Do n’t you remember what it was like to start a new job ? Everybody ’s first day at a new job is bad , Claire . ”
55252	55259	55249	55249	I	3245	“ I guess you ’re right . ”
55260	55289	55316	55327	my poor little baby all alone in that big cranky corporate office	979	“ Everything is going to be fine . Relax , and let him go . He ’s nearly a man . He needs to find his own way . ”
55290	55296	55297	55297	I	3245	“ Yeah , I know . ”
55441	55452	55424	55424	I	3245	“ How did it go at school today , Harry ? ”
55453	55456	55422	55422	he	979	“ Okay . ”
55457	55463	55422	55422	he	979	“ How was Mrs. Parkinson ? ”
55464	55471	55472	55472	He	979	“ A witch , as usual . ”
55475	55492	55472	55472	He	979	“ I do n’t think it ’s very nice to be calling your teacher a witch . ”
55493	55514	55556	55556	Harry	348	“ Yeah , well , if she stopped acting like one , I would n’t have to call her one . ”
55515	55555	55556	55556	Harry	348	“ Just stay out of trouble , please , Harry . You ’re on your last warning at that school . I need you to behave . You need to show everyone how smart and charming you really are . ”
55568	55600	55561	55561	Patrick	372	“ Now let ’s be nice when Fletch gets home . He ’s had a really bad day . And I want you boys to try and make him feel better . ”
55601	55611	55612	55612	Harry	348	“ And how are we supposed to do that ? ”
55619	55650	55651	55651	Harry	348	“ Just talk about things and take his mind off it . Make him laugh . Try and make him see that things are n’t as bad as he thinks . ”
55654	55672	55651	55651	Harry	348	“ I think they are as bad as he thinks . Imagine working with that pompous donkey . ”
55673	55681	55682	55682	I	3245	“ You do n’t even know him , ”
55685	55713	55682	55682	I	3245	“ You ca n’t say that ; he ’s a nice man . And he ’s Fletch ’s new boss , so you show him some respect . ”
55773	55781	55767	55767	I	3245	“ How is my big working boy ? ”
55782	55788	55789	55789	My	3245	“ It was literal hell . ”
55793	55799	55789	55789	My	3245	“ Why ? What happened ? ”
55800	55809	55767	55767	I	3245	“ Basically , I ruined everything I touched . ”
55810	55837	55838	55838	I	3245	“ That ’s okay . You ’re only new ; they ca n’t expect you to know everything . Nobody knows everything on the first day . ”
55845	55857	55838	55838	I	3245	“ What was the last thing that he said to you ? ”
55858	55867	55868	55868	I	3245	“ Do n’t you dare be late tomorrow . ”
55871	55884	55868	55868	I	3245	“ Did n’t he say ‘ Thanks for your first day ’ ? ”
55885	55898	55838	55838	I	3245	“ No , Mom . I told you he ’s an asshole . ”
55899	55912	55838	55838	I	3245	“ Hmm . Well , let ’s just see how tomorrow goes . ”
55913	55920	55868	55868	I	3245	“ I ’m not going back . ”
55921	55929	55930	55930	I	3245	“ Yes , you are , Fletcher , ”
55933	55979	55980	55980	Fletcher	1305	“ You ’re going to work two weeks there . I will not have you embarrassing me . If you do n’t like it after two weeks , you can stop , but you will ride it out and at least give it a chance . ”
56002	56008	55991	55991	I	3245	“ I made your favorite . ”
56009	56018	56019	56019	I	3245	“ I ’m too tired to eat it . ”
56031	56040	56019	56019	I	3245	“ I know , baby , me too . ”
56288	56293	56274	56274	I	3245	“ Hi , Fletch . ”
56294	56297	56298	56298	He	3029	“ Hi . ”
56305	56312	56298	56298	He	3029	“ I made you chocolate cake . ”
56319	56323	56313	56313	I	3245	“ Your favorite . ”
56324	56327	56328	56328	He	3029	“ Thanks . ”
56358	56364	56365	56365	He	3029	“ How was your day ? ”
56371	56374	56365	56365	He	3029	“ Hell . ”
56375	56378	56379	56379	I	3245	“ Really ? ”
56393	56400	56385	56385	I	3245	“ Why ? What happened today ? ”
56401	56413	56365	56365	He	3029	“ I ’m just not very good at it , Mom . ”
56414	56433	56434	56434	He	3029	“ Honey , you ’re not supposed to be very good at it . You ’re just new . ”
56447	56453	56454	56454	I	3245	“ What ’s Tristan like ? ”
56457	56460	56454	56454	I	3245	“ Mean . ”
56461	56464	56465	56465	I	3245	“ Mean ? ”
56468	56472	56473	56473	I	3245	“ Like how ? ”
56480	56486	56487	56487	He	3029	“ Give me an example . ”
56502	56505	56506	56506	He	3029	“ Well . ”
56517	56555	56506	56506	He	3029	“ We do this thing where he goes and visits all the managers on each floor , and I follow him around like a puppy and take notes . Today there was a meeting of everyone together . ”
56556	56565	56506	56506	He	3029	“ Yes , okay , that ’s standard . ”
56566	56595	56506	56506	He	3029	“ Well , today we got down to the fortieth floor and into the meeting , and I realized that I left my pen up on my desk . ”
56596	56599	56600	56600	I	3245	“ Yes . ”
56608	56612	56600	56600	I	3245	“ Go on . ”
56613	56636	56637	56637	I	3245	“ There were n’t any other pens there , so I just sat and listened to him talk along with everyone else . ”
56643	56692	56637	56637	I	3245	“ Halfway through the meeting he noticed I was n’t taking notes and asked why . I told him I left my pen behind , and he completely lost his shit , screamed at me in front of everyone , and kicked me out of the management meeting . ”
56693	56702	56703	56703	I	3245	“ What ? He was screaming at you ? ”
56706	56744	56703	56703	I	3245	“ Like a madman . Saying that he wo n’t put up with my laziness or sloppiness , and if I have no desire to learn , then I may as well leave Miles Media right now . ”
56752	56759	56703	56703	I	3245	“ What ? Over a pen ? ”
56760	56786	56637	56637	I	3245	“ Mom , that ’s not even the half of it . He yells at me the entire day . Everything I do is wrong . ”
56793	56799	56637	56637	I	3245	“ He yells at you ? ”
56800	56828	56829	56829	His	3245	“ Screams the fucking place down . Even Jameson , the CEO , had to come and rescue me today . He told him to settle down . ”
56833	56864	56865	56865	He	3245	“ And Jameson Miles is known for screaming at everyone all the time , Mom , so I know Tristan must n’t scream at anyone else like he does me . ”
56874	56912	56865	56865	He	3245	“ Sammia , Jameson ’s PA , even bought me a cupcake today . She feels sorry for me too . She told me not to worry about him — that I was doing a good job . ”
56917	56923	56924	56924	My	3245	“ He just hates me . ”
56936	56943	56944	56944	I	3245	“ Just ignore him , buddy . ”
56949	56955	56944	56944	I	3245	“ He ’ll settle down . ”
56959	56971	56944	56944	I	3245	“ Just keep your head down , and do your job . ”
56984	56989	56990	56990	He	3245	“ Cake before dinner ? ”
56993	57002	56990	56990	He	3245	“ Cake for dinner , if you want . ”
57030	57038	57039	57039	I	3245	“ What do you think , Marley ? ”
57042	57048	57039	57039	I	3245	“ Should I be worried ? ”
57049	57058	57059	57059	She	993	“ Hmm , it ’s a tough one . ”
57072	57087	57064	57064	We	994	“ On one hand , you want Fletch to be taught the right way . ”
57088	57107	57039	57039	I	3245	“ Yes , but he ’s screaming at him , Marl . In what job is that okay ? ”
57108	57116	57117	57117	She	993	“ It ’s not ; I agree . ”
57120	57130	57117	57117	She	993	“ It ’s so not okay in any workplace . ”
57131	57174	57064	57064	We	994	“ God , I ’m going crazy over this . What if he just hired him to put him through hell for the way they met ? What if he ’s purposely being nasty to teach me a lesson for ending it ? ”
57175	57181	57182	57182	She	993	“ It ’s completely possible . ”
57186	57205	57182	57182	She	993	“ But this job will set Fletch up for life , so more fool him , you know ? ”
57206	57224	57064	57064	We	994	“ But at what point is it enough ? Like how far do I let it go ? ”
57240	57248	57237	57237	I	3245	“ Fletch is on his lunch break . ”
57277	57282	57270	57270	he	3245	“ Hi , Fletch . ”
57286	57292	57283	57283	I	3245	“ How ’s it going ? ”
57293	57297	57298	57298	He	3245	“ Pretty shit . ”
57301	57304	57298	57298	He	3245	“ Why ? ”
57305	57314	57315	57315	My	3245	“ Well , apparently now I ’m stupid . ”
57319	57325	57315	57315	My	3245	“ He called you stupid ? ”
57326	57329	57298	57298	He	3245	“ Yep . ”
57330	57335	57336	57336	My	3245	“ That ’s it . ”
57340	57348	57336	57336	My	3245	“ Do n’t go back after lunch . ”
57349	57352	57315	57315	My	3245	“ Mom . ”
57353	57358	57359	57359	I	3245	“ I mean it , ”
57362	57377	57378	57378	Marley	100	“ He ca n’t call you fucking stupid , Fletcher ; that is unacceptable . ”
57388	57391	57392	57392	she	100	“ What ? ”
57395	57401	57392	57392	she	100	“ He called him stupid ? ”
57402	57419	57385	57385	she	100	“ No job is worth your self - respect , Fletcher . Do not go back . ”
57420	57440	57392	57392	she	100	“ Mom , shut up . You ’re making it worse . I should n’t have even told you . ”
57441	57444	57445	57445	He	3245	“ Fletcher . ”
57449	57454	57455	57455	I	3245	“ That ’s it , ”
57458	57467	57468	57468	I	3245	“ He ’s gone too far this time . ”
57483	57499	57468	57468	I	3245	“ Meet you back at work . I have an appointment with Tristan fucking Miles . ”
57500	57507	57508	57508	She	100	“ Oh shit . Good luck . ”
57516	57526	57511	57511	I	3245	“ Bail me out of jail , will you ? ”
57536	57552	57527	57527	She	100	“ Yes , okay , what account do I take the bail money out of ? ”
57553	57562	57527	57527	She	100	“ You ’ll have to rob a bank . ”
57563	57567	57568	57568	I	3245	“ Roger that . ”
57616	57624	57625	57627	The young girl	100	“ Hello , may I help you ? ”
57630	57641	57625	57627	The young girl	100	“ I ’d like to see Tristan Miles , please . ”
57642	57649	57625	57627	The young girl	100	“ Did you have an appointment ? ”
57650	57653	57625	57627	The young girl	100	“ No . ”
57654	57664	57625	57627	The young girl	100	“ I ’m sorry ; that will be impossible . ”
57665	57677	57625	57627	The young girl	100	“ You tell him Claire Anderson is here to see him . ”
57678	57683	57684	57684	she	100	“ I ’m sorry — ”
57687	57691	57692	57692	I	3245	“ Tell him , ”
57696	57706	57707	57707	She	100	“ I ’m not leaving until I see him . ”
57721	57738	57716	57716	she	100	“ Hi , Sammia . I have a Claire Anderson to see Tristan Miles in reception . ”
57748	57754	57739	57739	She	100	“ She ’s just checking . ”
57779	57785	57786	57786	She	100	“ Okay , thank you . ”
57799	57810	57786	57786	She	100	“ You can go up . Hector will accompany you . ”
57811	57818	57819	57819	I	3245	“ I can find it myself , ”
57822	57834	57835	57835	He	1001	“ Nobody goes to the top floor without a security guard . ”
57842	57845	57846	57846	She	100	“ Fine . ”
57858	57872	57854	57854	he	1001	“ Can you please escort Mrs. Anderson to see Tristan Miles , please ? ”
57873	57877	57878	57878	He	1001	“ Sure thing . ”
57883	57889	57890	57890	He	1001	“ This way , please . ”
58004	58018	57999	58001	The pretty receptionist	1005	“ Hello , I ’m Sammia . You ’re here to see Tristan ? ”
58019	58024	58025	58025	I	3245	“ Yes , please . ”
58034	58042	58025	58025	I	3245	“ Hello , I ’m Claire Anderson . ”
58043	58049	58050	58050	Her	1005	“ Are you . . . ”
58055	58064	58050	58050	Her	1005	“ Yes , I ’m Fletcher ’s mother . ”
58082	58088	58089	58089	She	1005	“ Oh , I see . ”
58097	58103	58089	58089	She	1005	“ This way , please . ”
58134	58142	58143	58143	she	1005	“ His office is at the end , ”
58193	58202	58203	58203	he	1305	“ Mom , what are you doing here ? ”
58209	58214	58203	58203	he	1305	“ Just visiting Tristan . ”
58220	58225	58215	58215	I	3245	“ Thanks , Sammia . ”
58271	58275	58276	58276	He	1305	“ Claire Anderson . ”
58284	58294	58295	58295	he	1305	“ And to what do I owe this pleasure ? ”
58302	58310	58311	58311	I	3245	“ Oh , I think you know , ”
58319	58328	58314	58314	He	1305	“ No . Actually , I do n’t . ”
58329	58339	58295	58295	he	1305	“ What the hell are you doing to Fletcher ? ”
58340	58346	58314	58314	He	1305	“ What do you mean ? ”
58347	58351	58352	58352	I	3245	“ I mean , ”
58355	58383	58384	58384	He	1305	“ how dare you call him stupid ? How dare you scream at him in front of other staff ? Or at all , for that matter . ”
58393	58403	58384	58384	He	1305	“ Did he run to Mommy , did he ? ”
58404	58407	58408	58408	I	3245	“ Tristan , ”
58412	58446	58447	58447	He	1305	“ I understand that you met in terrible circumstances , but it ’s clearly obvious that you only hired him to make a fool of him . And I wo n’t have it . ”
58458	58465	58447	58447	He	1305	“ Is that what you think ? ”
58466	58473	58474	58474	He	1305	“ That ’s what I know . ”
58484	58511	58474	58474	He	1305	“ I ’ll tell you what I ’m doing with Fletcher Anderson . I ’m teaching him work ethic . He ’s lazy and needs discipline . ”
58512	58524	58525	58525	I	3245	“ You are not training him ; you are belittling him , ”
58529	58539	58540	58540	he	1305	“ I ’m teaching him to have some respect , ”
58544	58556	58540	58540	he	1305	“ Something that he quite obviously has n’t learned at home . ”
58557	58569	58570	58570	I	3245	“ Why on earth would he respect a jerk like you ? ”
58574	58593	58594	58594	he	1305	“ Because I ’m his boss , Claire , and I am not putting up with his excuses , ”
58597	58603	58604	58604	I	3245	“ By calling him stupid , ”
58607	58667	58604	58604	I	3245	“ I did not call him stupid . I told him to stop acting stupid . There ’s a big difference . He ’s intelligent , Claire , a lot more than you give him credit for . He does n’t have anger issues ; he has a fucking attitude issue , and I ’m getting rid of it . ”
58668	58676	58677	58677	I	3245	“ By making a fool of him ? ”
58680	58717	58677	58677	I	3245	“ By making him learn from his mistakes . If he is not punished as he does them , he will keep doing it . You do n’t learn a lesson unless it makes you uncomfortable . ”
58718	58733	58734	58734	I	3245	“ You yelled at him for forgetting a pen , for Christ ’s sake , ”
58743	58762	58763	58763	he	3245	“ How many CEOs do you know that do n’t take a pen to a meeting , Claire ? ”
58766	58771	58772	58772	He	3245	“ Rule number one . ”
58782	58795	58772	58772	He	3245	“ Be prepared . Do not turn up to a meeting unprepared . ”
58817	58828	58829	58829	he	3245	“ You run to Mommy when you get into trouble ? ”
58837	58853	58854	58854	he	3245	“ You going to run to Mommy when someone steals your business or your girlfriend ? ”
58857	58869	58854	58854	he	3245	“ Is that what a man does ? Run to Mommy ? ”
58870	58875	58876	58876	I	3245	“ How dare you ? ”
58880	58901	58876	58876	I	3245	“ Get your things , Fletcher ; we ’re leaving . You do n’t have to put up with this . ”
58902	58916	58917	58917	Tristan	3029	“ Get back to your desk , Fletcher , and finish that report , ”
58930	58934	58935	58935	Tristan	3029	“ Fletcher Anderson , ”
58946	58975	58938	58938	His	1305	“ That report is to be on my desk before you leave today . I do n’t care if we do n’t get out of here until midnight . ”
58976	58983	58984	58984	I	3245	“ He ’s coming with me , ”
58987	58995	58984	58984	I	3245	“ Stick your report up your ass . ”
58996	58999	59000	59000	Fletcher	1305	“ Mom , ”
59003	59007	59000	59000	Fletcher	1305	“ Do n’t . ”
59008	59015	59016	59016	I	3245	“ Fletcher , let ’s go , ”
59019	59036	59037	59037	Tristan	3029	“ Do you want to know why I ’m riding this kid so hard , Claire ? ”
59045	59067	59040	59040	I	3245	“ Because Fletcher Anderson has more potential than I ’ve seen in a very long time . He ’s super intelligent . ”
59079	59096	59097	59097	he	3029	“ But he ’s also a little shit , and he ’s lazy and lacks discipline , ”
59107	59196	59197	59197	Fletcher	1305	“ I can give him the tools that he needs , but they do n’t come easy . There are no shortcuts to this , Claire . I ’m the only person who can give him the tool kit . So do n’t you barge in here and ruin everything for him . You are killing this kid with kindness , Claire . He ’s not a child . He ’s a man . He needs to grow the fuck up and take responsibility for his own shortcomings . ”
59202	59214	59215	59215	he	1305	“ Why the hell are you still standing here , Fletcher ? ”
59218	59225	59215	59215	he	1305	“ Go and finish the report . ”
59226	59234	59235	59235	Fletcher	1305	“ See you at home , Mom , ”
59282	59288	59289	59289	I	3245	“ I ’m watching you , ”
59292	59310	59289	59289	I	3245	“ I ’ll tell you who to watch : that middle child of yours . The wizard . ”
59311	59323	59324	59324	I	3245	“ The middle child of mine is none of your concern , ”
59363	59368	59369	59369	He	286	“ Goodbye , Tristan . ”
59378	59381	59382	59382	I	3245	“ What ? ”
59385	59390	59391	59391	He	286	“ Is that it ? ”
59399	59410	59391	59391	He	286	“ Is that all you want to say to me ? ”
59424	59435	59436	59436	He	286	“ I ’ve got nothing more to say to you . ”
59443	59446	59436	59436	He	286	“ Liar . ”
59985	59990	59991	59991	Harry	348	“ Give it back , ”
60105	60115	60116	60116	Michael	168	“ I think that just about wraps it up , ”
60143	60151	60131	60131	I	3245	“ That ’s great ; thank you . ”
60152	60174	60124	60124	he	168	“ As long as we keep gaining traction on the advertising , we should be able to pull out of this . ”
60175	60179	60180	60180	I	3245	“ I agree . ”
60188	60209	60180	60180	I	3245	“ Thank you all so much for pulling together and working through the issues . Your advice is so appreciated . ”
60210	60217	60218	60218	Michael	168	“ We ’ll get through this . ”
60221	60229	60218	60218	Michael	168	“ It ’s just a rough patch . ”
60230	60234	60235	60235	I	3245	“ I know . ”
60238	60242	60243	60247	The group of ten stands	1037	“ Thanks again . ”
60324	60332	60333	60333	I	3245	“ I ’ll see you next month ? ”
60336	60342	60333	60333	I	3245	“ For sure . Bye . ”
60343	60353	60333	60333	I	3245	“ See you . Do you need a lift ? ”
60354	60364	60365	60365	I	3245	“ No , I ’m fine . Thanks anyway . ”
60424	60430	60431	60431	I	3245	“ Hi , just finished , ”
60434	60444	60431	60431	I	3245	“ I ’m across the street in Luciano ’s . ”
60445	60455	60456	60456	I	3245	“ Fancy finding Gabriel Ferrara in an Italian restaurant , ”
60459	60466	60467	60467	he	284	“ Shocking , is n’t it , ”
60471	60478	60467	60467	he	284	“ I ’m coming out now . ”
60479	60484	60485	60485	I	3245	“ On my way . ”
60553	60558	60559	60559	He	284	“ Hello , Bella . ”
60562	60565	60566	60566	He	284	“ Hello . ”
60579	60583	60566	60566	He	284	“ The usual ? ”
60584	60592	60593	60593	We	1046	“ Uh - huh , sounds good . ”
60603	60616	60593	60593	We	1046	“ Oh , did I tell you that Fletcher started an internship ? ”
60617	60637	60566	60566	He	284	“ No , you called and told me he wanted to , but I have n’t seen you since . ”
60638	60641	60642	60642	I	3245	“ Oh . ”
60647	60661	60642	60642	I	3245	“ In the end , I could n’t talk him out of it . ”
60662	60675	60676	60676	he	3245	“ You know , I think it will be good for him , ”
60688	60716	60676	60676	he	3245	“ Hmm , yes , I think so too . Time will tell . I still think he ’s too young to be in an office environment . ”
60717	60724	60743	60743	He	3245	“ He ’s eighteen , Claire . ”
60725	60742	60743	60743	He	3245	“ I know he is . I guess he will always be a baby to me . ”
60862	60875	60876	60876	Gabriel	284	“ You grab a table , and I ’ll get some drinks , ”
60879	60883	60876	60876	Gabriel	284	“ The usual ? ”
60884	60889	60890	60890	He	284	“ Yes , please . ”
61227	61230	61214	61214	Gabriel	284	“ Thanks . ”
61249	61255	61256	61256	Gabriel	284	“ How was your meeting ? ”
61259	61262	61263	61263	I	3245	“ Good . ”
61279	61299	61300	61300	Gabriel	284	“ The advertising has picked up , and the figures this month were good . Hopefully it will continue . ”
61306	61315	61300	61300	Gabriel	284	“ You know , I ’ve been thinking . ”
61316	61321	61322	61322	I	3245	“ Did it hurt ? ”
61328	61338	61322	61322	I	3245	“ Why do n’t you let me help you ? ”
61339	61347	61300	61300	Gabriel	284	“ And how would you do that ? ”
61348	61384	61322	61322	I	3245	“ I could buy fifty percent of Anderson Media and take over half the debt . We could work together . I could even be a silent partner , if that ’s what you prefer . ”
61385	61388	61389	61389	I	3245	“ What ? ”
61405	61426	61430	61430	him	284	“ I ’m serious . I have the contacts , and we could really build it up for the boys . ”
61432	61434	61436	61436	his	284	“ And then”—he
61438	61455	61436	61436	his	284	casually—“when you got back on your feet , you could buy my portion back from me . ”
61456	61462	61436	61436	his	284	“ You ’d do that ? ”
61463	61475	61476	61476	I	3245	“ Of course , anything for you . You know that . ”
61483	61487	61476	61476	I	3245	“ Claire Anderson , ”
61510	61515	61516	61516	I	3245	“ Oh , hi , ”
61532	61539	61540	61540	he	3029	“ Drinking on a school night ? ”
61543	61552	61553	61553	Gabriel	284	“ She ’s on a date with me , ”
61572	61577	61556	61556	Tristan	3029	“ Is that so ? ”
61605	61615	61616	61616	I	3245	“ Ah , Tristan , do you know Gabriel ? ”
61633	61641	61642	61642	Gabriel	284	“ Hello , I ’m Tristan Miles . ”
61653	61660	61642	61642	Gabriel	284	“ I know who you are . ”
61669	61673	61661	61661	Tristan	3029	“ No handshake ? ”
61699	61720	61721	61721	I	3245	“ Tristan , if you do n’t mind . . . we are in the middle of a business meeting , ”
61724	61733	61734	61734	he	284	“ I thought you were on a date ? ”
61738	61745	61746	61746	Gabriel	284	“ She is . We are , ”
61771	61779	61780	61780	I	3245	“ What do you want , Tristan ? ”
61783	61793	61780	61780	I	3245	“ I need to talk to you , Claire . ”
61794	61797	61798	61798	He	284	“ About ? ”
61810	61813	61798	61798	He	284	“ Fletcher . ”
61814	61827	61828	61828	Gabriel	284	“ What the fuck do you want to talk about Fletcher for ? ”
61839	61871	61831	61831	Tristan	3029	“ Do you mind with the coarse language ? Fletcher is my intern , and I need to speak to his mother . So if you do n’t mind . . . ”
61872	61879	61880	61880	Gabriel	284	“ Fletcher is . . . ? ”
61885	61896	61897	61897	he	284	“ Fletcher is working for Miles ? Why , Claire ? ”
61900	61909	61910	61910	Tristan	3029	“ He wanted to work for the best . ”
61957	61966	61967	61967	I	3245	“ You want to talk to me now ? ”
61970	61975	61976	61976	He	284	“ Yes . Now . ”
61982	61994	61976	61976	He	284	“ Goodbye . This particular meeting is of a private nature . ”
61995	62002	62003	62003	Gabriel	284	“ I ’m not going anywhere , ”
62014	62035	62006	62006	Tristan	3029	“ I could always come to see you in your office tomorrow , Claire . . . on your desk . ”
62036	62043	62044	62044	Gabriel	284	“ You mean at her desk , ”
62056	62063	62047	62047	Tristan	3029	“ I know what I meant . ”
62113	62140	62141	62141	They	1071	“ Gabriel , just give me ten minutes to speak to Tristan about Fletcher . Why do n’t you go and order us some more drinks ? ”
62157	62163	62164	62164	he	284	“ You have five minutes , ”
62196	62202	62190	62190	he	284	“ What are you doing ? ”
62216	62222	62206	62206	He	284	“ What are you doing ? ”
62223	62233	62243	62243	he	284	“ I ’m having a drink with a friend . ”
62234	62242	62243	62243	he	284	“ You ’re friends with Gabriel Ferrara ? ”
62246	62254	62255	62255	I	3245	“ Yes , I am , actually , ”
62269	62277	62259	62259	He	284	“ What kind of friend , Claire ? ”
62278	62286	62259	62259	He	284	“ That ’s none of your business . ”
62287	62317	62318	62318	I	3245	“ So let me get this straight : you do n’t want to see me because of what I do for a living . . . but you are — ”
62323	62337	62318	62318	I	3245	“ I do n’t want to see you because you ’re a coward . ”
62338	62346	62318	62318	I	3245	“ How the fuck am I coward ? ”
62347	62361	62362	62362	I	3245	“ One meeting with my children , and you run for the hills , ”
62389	62416	62417	62417	he	284	“ You told me you did n’t want to see me before I even met your children . Do not fucking lie to me , Claire , ”
62435	62453	62426	62426	I	3245	“ I know who the coward is here , Claire , and it is n’t fucking me . ”
62454	62472	62417	62417	he	284	“ You arrogant prick . Have you ever considered that maybe I just do n’t like you ? ”
62473	62486	62487	62487	I	3245	“ No . I have n’t . Because I know you do . ”
62495	62526	62487	62487	I	3245	“ I know that you think that every woman in the world is in love with you , but I can assure you , Mr. Miles , I am not . ”
62549	62552	62553	62553	He	3245	“ What ? ”
62564	62589	62590	62590	I	3245	“ I know for a fact that if I wanted to take you home , I could have you riding my cock all night . ”
62618	62624	62625	62625	I	3245	“ The hell you could , ”
62648	62668	62639	62639	His	3245	“ It would n’t bother you that I did n’t like your children if you did n’t want me . ”
62683	62687	62688	62688	He	3245	“ Fuck you . ”
62692	62714	62688	62688	He	3245	“ Admit it , Anderson ; you think about me . . . just as much as I think about you . ”
62728	62734	62735	62735	I	3245	“ You think about me ? ”
62738	62750	62735	62735	I	3245	“ All the fucking time . You ’re driving me insane . ”
62765	62768	62759	62759	I	3245	“ On that note”—he
62769	62778	62735	62735	I	3245	stands—“I’ll let you get back to your date . ”
62783	62796	62797	62797	I	3245	“ It ’s not a date . He ’s just a friend , ”
62805	62809	62797	62797	I	3245	“ Prove it . ”
62827	62834	62835	62835	he	3245	“ Call me in two hours , ”
62838	62845	62835	62835	he	3245	“ Why would I do that ? ”
62852	62876	62846	62846	His	3245	“ Because I ’ve never needed to please a woman as much as I crave to please you . . . let me . ”
63504	63509	63487	63487	Gabriel	284	“ Here you go . ”
63510	63513	63514	63514	He	284	“ Thanks . ”
63519	63524	63514	63514	He	284	“ Are you serious ? ”
63525	63528	63529	63529	I	3245	“ Gabriel . ”
63542	63550	63533	63533	we	1086	“ Fletcher wanted to work for them . ”
63551	63562	63563	63563	he	284	“ Why would n’t he come and work for me ? ”
63566	63579	63563	63563	he	284	“ I ’m offended . Ferrara Media is where he should be . ”
63580	63597	63603	63603	he	284	“ He applied without me even knowing . I have to let him choose his path . ”
63598	63602	63603	63603	he	284	“ With him ? ”
63665	63668	63657	63657	I	3245	“ Look , ”
63673	63727	63669	63669	I	3245	“ It ’s only twelve months , and I know that it is n’t ideal , but it will be good for him to get out of his comfort zone . And besides , he ’s giving them a run for their money , so he might not even last without being fired . ”
63728	63736	63790	63791	BYE BOOTY	176	“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
63737	63747	63790	63791	BYE BOOTY	176	“ Because I knew you would react like this . ”
63812	63831	63832	63832	Gabriel	284	“ I ’m not impressed at all , Claire . I do n’t like him being around them , ”
63838	63851	63852	63852	I	3245	“ You know as well as I do they are good businesspeople , ”

70006	70011	70003	70003	He	1305	“ I ’m Paul . ”
70012	70021	70022	70022	Claire	372	“ This is Tristan , Fletcher ’s boss , ”
70033	70036	70037	70037	I	3245	“ Hello , ”
70072	70078	70062	70062	Fletcher	1305	“ Have fun , Mom . ”
70079	70084	70085	70085	She	2777	“ Thanks , darling . ”
70090	70095	70085	70085	She	2777	“ Are you ready ? ”
70096	70100	70101	70101	Paul	180	“ Sure am . ”
70193	70205	70206	70206	She	2777	“ Wo n’t be late , sweetie . Bye , Tristan . ”
70239	70249	70234	70234	I	3245	“ What are you going to do about this ? ”
70250	70255	70216	70216	her	2777	“ Nothing . Why ? ”
70256	70266	70267	70267	I	3245	“ Why are n’t you attacking him with underpants ? ”
70272	70286	70287	70287	I	3245	“ What good are you if you ’re not going to be consistent ? ”
70298	70322	70323	70323	He	1305	“ Consistency is key , Fletcher . If your mother is n’t allowed to date , she is n’t allowed to date anyone . ”
70328	70333	70323	70323	He	1305	“ You coming in ? ”
70334	70342	70343	70343	I	3245	“ Yes , I am , actually . ”
70380	70402	70373	70373	I	3245	“ I did n’t get a chance to talk to her yet . I better wait for her to get home . ”
70409	70418	70403	70403	I	3245	“ Where does your mother keep her wine ? ”
70419	70422	70423	70428	The little dark - haired boy	901	“ Hi . ”
70434	70439	70423	70428	The little dark - haired boy	901	“ You came back . ”
70440	70446	70447	70447	I	3245	“ Yes , I did . ”
70460	70467	70468	70468	He	901	“ What ’s your name again ? ”
70471	70474	70475	70475	I	3245	“ Tristan . ”
70478	70484	70485	70485	He	901	“ I remember your name . ”
70491	70496	70485	70485	He	901	“ What is it ? ”
70497	70500	70501	70501	His	901	“ Patrick . ”
70507	70511	70512	70512	He	901	“ It is . ”
70521	70530	70516	70516	I	3245	“ Where ’s that other brother of yours ? ”
70531	70534	70535	70535	He	901	“ Who ? ”
70538	70544	70535	70535	He	901	“ The Harry Potter one . ”
70545	70561	70562	70562	Patrick	372	“ Oh , he ’s at school camp . He gets back in the morning , ”
70565	70568	70569	70572	One less crazy fucker	1170	“ Great . ”
70577	70581	70582	70582	Fletcher	1305	“ No way , ”
70591	70594	70595	70595	I	3245	“ What ? ”
70598	70603	70604	70604	He	372	“ Oh my God . ”
70612	70619	70604	70604	He	372	“ Alita VanDerCamp just messaged me . ”
70620	70623	70624	70624	I	3245	“ And ? ”
70627	70636	70637	70637	His	372	“ She ’s the hottest girl in school . ”
70644	70649	70650	70650	I	3245	“ Hmm , okay . ”
70665	70687	70688	70688	Patrick	372	“ Where are the wineglasses , and who the hell is Paul from Pilates ? He looks like a real tool . ”
70704	70707	70708	70708	Fletcher	1305	“ Hey , ”
70714	70719	70708	70708	Fletcher	1305	“ That ’s it ? ”
70735	70751	70752	70752	I	3245	“ That ’s what you ’re going to write ? You ca n’t write hey . ”
70764	70768	70769	70769	I	3245	“ Why not ? ”
70774	70786	70769	70769	I	3245	“ Do n’t tell me you are clueless with women too . ”
70787	70795	70796	70796	he	372	“ Well , what would you write ? ”
70799	70813	70769	70769	I	3245	“ I would n’t text a girl back unless I had a plan . ”
70814	70818	70819	70819	Fletcher	1305	“ A plan . ”
70822	70830	70831	70831	I	3245	“ What the hell does that mean ? ”
70852	70869	70870	70870	Patrick	372	“ If a girl texts you , she ’s looking for more than a fucking hey . ”
70884	70895	70879	70879	I	3245	“ I swear sometimes . Do n’t tell your mother . ”
70896	70899	70900	70900	He	372	“ Okay . ”
70903	70908	70900	70900	He	372	“ Harry swears too . ”
70916	70919	70920	70920	Fletcher	1305	“ So ? ”
70925	70935	70920	70920	Fletcher	1305	“ Like . . . what kind of plan ? ”
70936	70990	70991	70991	I	3245	“ Like , do you want to get something to eat , do you want to go to the movies . . . something like that . Strike while the iron ’s hot . If she texted you first , she ’s into you . Move fast , before she changes her mind . ”
70996	71016	70991	70991	I	3245	“ Girls are changeable , man . One day they like you ; the next day they do n’t . ”
71017	71020	71021	71021	His	372	“ Oh . ”
71025	71035	71021	71021	His	372	“ So I ’ll call her tomorrow , then ? ”
71036	71044	71045	71045	I	3245	“ No , are n’t you listening ? ”
71050	71055	71045	71045	I	3245	“ Call her now . ”
71056	71065	71021	71021	His	372	“ But I ca n’t do anything tonight . ”
71066	71070	71021	71021	His	372	“ Why not ? ”
71071	71078	71045	71045	I	3245	“ Because I ’m minding Patrick . ”
71079	71094	71095	71095	I	3245	“ On the off chance she says yes , I ’ll stay with him . ”
71118	71133	71111	71111	Fletcher	1305	“ I ’m waiting here for your mother anyway . I do n’t mind . ”
71184	71190	71173	71173	Ahh	1174	“ Ow , ease up . ”
71197	71208	71191	71192	These kids	884	“ You got a good hook on you , kid . ”
71209	71221	71222	71222	he	372	“ I know ; I made Harry cry the other day , ”
71226	71238	71239	71239	I	3245	“ I pulled his hair and punched him in the neck . ”
71249	71266	71267	71267	Fletcher	1305	“ Hmm , not sure if that ’s okay , but . . . well done . ”
71272	71281	71282	71282	He	372	“ So . . . I say hi . ”
71294	71300	71301	71301	He	372	“ And then . . . ”
71307	71314	71301	71301	He	372	“ What do I say then ? ”
71320	71344	71345	71345	I	3245	“ Hello , my name is Fletcher , and I do n’t know where I keep my balls , so call someone else , ”
71357	71370	71349	71349	Fletcher	1305	“ I ca n’t do it . I ’m not calling her . ”
71371	71375	71349	71349	Fletcher	1305	“ Call her . ”
71376	71387	71349	71349	Fletcher	1305	“ No . I do n’t know what to say . ”
71388	71392	71393	71393	I	3245	“ Call her , ”
71405	71410	71396	71396	I	3245	“ I ca n’t . ”
71411	71417	71418	71418	I	3245	“ Yes , you can . ”
71431	71442	71418	71418	I	3245	“ We ’re going out here . Do it now . ”
71443	71450	71451	71451	he	372	“ What if she says no ? ”
71457	71461	71462	71462	I	3245	“ Who cares ? ”
71465	71476	71462	71462	I	3245	“ The world is full of hot girls , Fletcher . ”
71477	71484	71418	71418	I	3245	“ Not as hot as her . ”
71485	71499	71500	71500	Fletcher	1305	“ So why are you wasting time talking crap to us , then ? ”
71506	71516	71500	71500	Fletcher	1305	“ Okay , I ’m going to do it . ”
71517	71520	71462	71462	I	3245	“ Good . ”
71521	71531	71540	71540	I	3245	“ I ’m going to call her right now . ”
71532	71539	71540	71540	I	3245	“ Less talking , more action , ”
71543	71546	71547	71547	He	372	“ Okay . ”
71622	71636	71637	71637	he	372	“ Do you want to watch a movie while we wait for pizza ? ”
71640	71646	71637	71637	he	372	“ There ’s pizza coming ? ”
71647	71652	71653	71653	He	372	“ Uh - huh . ”
71674	71686	71668	71668	I	3245	“ What time did your mother say she was coming home ? ”
71687	71697	71637	71637	he	372	“ She ’s just having dinner . Not late . ”
71698	71709	71710	71710	I	3245	“ Has she been out with Paul from Pilates before ? ”
71713	71743	71744	71744	I	3245	“ Yes , but she has to hide from Harry . She can only go out when he ’s not home , because he ’s very rude and embarrassing . ”
71799	71804	71791	71791	Fletcher	1305	“ She said yes . ”
71805	71809	71780	71780	she	1179	“ She did ? ”
71810	71818	71780	71780	she	1179	“ We ’re going to get food . ”
71819	71823	71824	71824	I	3245	“ You are ? ”
71832	71835	71836	71836	His	1179	“ Great . ”
71842	71848	71836	71836	His	1179	“ What will I wear ? ”
71849	71853	71854	71854	I	3245	“ Oh Jesus . ”
71865	71883	71860	71860	Patrick	372	“ Just wear something nice . And have a shower . Girls like dudes who smell nice . ”
71896	71900	71901	71901	I	3245	“ Since when ? ”
71909	71920	71901	71901	I	3245	“ What does your mother actually teach you about girls ? ”
71921	71924	71925	71925	He	372	“ Nothing . ”
71930	71940	71941	71941	I	3245	“ She thinks I ’m too young to date . ”
71952	71976	71941	71941	I	3245	“ And anyway , how come you did n’t attack Paul from Pilates ? Why is she allowed to go out with him ? ”
71977	71980	71981	71981	Fletcher	1305	“ Oh . ”
71984	71989	71990	71990	I	3245	“ He ’s gay . ”
71997	72008	71990	71990	I	3245	“ Oh , he is . . . is he ? ”
72009	72021	72022	72022	He	372	“ Well , I do n’t actually know that for sure . ”
72026	72039	72022	72022	He	372	“ But he is n’t Mom ’s type , so . . . ”
72040	72050	71990	71990	I	3245	“ Why is n’t he your mother ’s type ? ”
72051	72093	72022	72022	He	372	“ Because she does Pilates with him . Nobody does Pilates with a guy they like . . . do they ? And besides , he wears a pink sweatband around his head . He ’s odd . Weird , even . ”
72094	72097	72098	72098	I	3245	“ Hmm . ”
72108	72134	72135	72135	I	3245	“ That ’s a very good point , Fletcher . Nobody does date a guy who wears a pink sweatband around their head at Pilates , ”
72142	72145	72135	72135	I	3245	“ Precisely . ”
72154	72163	72164	72164	I	3245	“ Oh . . . and , Fletch ? ”
72169	72172	72164	72164	I	3245	“ Yeah . ”
72173	72181	72182	72182	He	1305	“ Spank the pony in the shower . ”
72191	72194	72195	72195	I	3245	“ What ? ”
72198	72210	72211	72211	Fletcher	1305	“ Do that . . . you know , the thing . ”
72214	72218	72211	72211	Fletcher	1305	“ What for ? ”
72219	72233	72234	72234	I	3245	“ Do you want the whole restaurant to know how happy you are ? ”
72244	72261	72262	72262	He	1305	“ You want to appear as least . . . excitable . . . as possible . ”
72267	72273	72274	72274	Patrick	372	“ This is a thing ? ”
72277	72290	72274	72274	Patrick	372	“ Wait , what ? There ’s a pony in the shower ? ”
72291	72297	72298	72298	I	3245	“ It ’s a song , ”
72303	72340	72298	72298	I	3245	“ This is the thing , Fletch . Nobody goes on a date without listening to ‘ Spanking the Pony ’ before they go . Everybody knows that . It ’s the dating rule number one . ”
72370	72377	72378	72378	He	1305	“ Are you serious right now ? ”
72386	72393	72394	72394	He	1305	“ Trust me on this one . ”
72414	72422	72409	72409	I	3245	“ What do you want to watch ? ”
72423	72426	72427	72427	he	1305	“ Godzilla ? ”
72430	72439	72440	72440	I	3245	“ Yeah , that ’s a good one . ”
72447	72459	72440	72440	I	3245	“ I hope the pizza hurries up . I ’m starving . ”
72475	72479	72460	72460	Patrick	372	“ Me too . ”
72703	72706	72695	72695	her	2366	“ Tristan . ”
72740	72747	72728	72728	She	2366	“ What are you doing here ? ”
72766	72783	72784	72784	I	3245	“ I babysat for you tonight . I believe you owe me a thank - you , ”
72790	72793	72794	72794	she	2366	“ What ? ”
72797	72804	72784	72784	I	3245	“ Fletcher had to go out . ”
72805	72809	72794	72794	she	2366	“ To where ? ”
72810	72859	72875	72875	she	2366	“ That VanDerCamp girl that he likes texted him , and I said I would stay with Patrick . Fletcher is home now , though , asleep in bed . He was n’t gone for long at all . I ’m assuming the date did n’t go well . ”
72860	72874	72875	72875	she	2366	“ Are you kidding me ? He left you here alone with Patrick ? ”
72879	72893	72875	72875	she	2366	“ Oh , Fletcher is in so much trouble you would n’t believe . ”
72894	72901	72902	72902	I	3245	“ I told him to go , ”
72905	72923	72902	72902	I	3245	“ I do n’t mind . Do you mind telling me who the fuck Pilates Paul is ? ”
72924	72930	72931	72931	She	2366	“ None of your business . ”
72937	72945	72931	72931	She	2366	“ Now . . . good night . ”
72946	72964	72965	72965	Her	2366	“ Well , that ’s not a very nice way to treat your babysitter , is it ? ”
72970	72977	72978	72978	she	2366	“ You are not my babysitter , ”
72981	72990	72978	72978	she	2366	“ You ’re a pain in my ass . ”
72991	72994	72995	72995	I	3245	“ Me ? ”
73004	73010	72995	72995	I	3245	“ What did I do ? ”
73011	73016	73017	73017	she	2366	“ You annoy me , ”
73038	73046	73026	73026	I	3245	“ And why do I annoy you ? ”
73047	73065	73017	73017	she	2366	“ Go back to your carefree dates , Tristan . Stay the hell away from my kids . ”
73104	73121	73122	73122	She	2366	“ It was nice . . . actually . Went with the pizza and all that . ”
73128	73134	73122	73122	She	2366	“ You drank my wine ? ”
73135	73151	73158	73158	she	2366	“ Do n’t change the subject . Why does me dating other women annoy you ? ”
73152	73157	73158	73158	she	2366	“ It does n’t , ”
73162	73176	73158	73158	she	2366	“ I do n’t have time for your shit tonight . Go home . ”
73185	73196	73177	73177	I	3245	“ I ca n’t drive . I ’ve been drinking . ”
73197	73201	73202	73202	she	2366	“ My wine , ”
73219	73239	73205	73205	I	3245	“ You ’re in a very bad mood . Am I right in assuming Paul from Pilates is responsible ? ”
73240	73254	73255	73255	She	2366	“ No , you ’re not , actually . Tristan Miles is responsible . ”
73296	73302	73286	73286	She	2366	“ I ’ll do it . ”
73303	73306	73307	73307	She	2366	“ No . ”
73315	73327	73307	73307	She	2366	“ I do n’t want you anywhere near my devil children . ”
73328	73331	73332	73332	I	3245	“ Oh . ”
73344	73355	73337	73337	she	2366	“ This is about what I said about the wizard . ”
73356	73393	73394	73394	she	2366	“ His name is Harry , and yes , I do take offense to some pompous , spoiled asshole telling me that my children are misbehaved when he knows nothing about what they have been through , ”
73398	73405	73406	73406	she	2366	“ Get out of my way , ”

78894	78926	78927	78927	He	1267	“ I do n’t think he ’s a bad guy in a good suit like I first thought . I think he ’s actually a good guy in a good suit . ”
78937	78944	78927	78927	He	1267	“ He ’s actually pretty funny . ”
79008	79027	79028	79028	His	1267	“ So . . . sleeping with only you . . . is n’t a problem for me . ”

79467	79482	79464	79464	She	1275	“ Hmm , probably mediocre sushi from around the corner . Save my feet . ”
79483	79494	79495	79495	I	3245	“ Mediocre sushi is better than no sushi at all , ”
79498	79503	79504	79504	She	1275	“ This is true . ”

83718	83727	83715	83715	I	3245	“ How will I walk around like this ? ”
83738	83747	83748	83748	I	3245	“ How will I face people in meetings ? ”
83756	83785	83786	83786	Jameson	73	“ Hi , I ’m here to take over your company . Do n’t mind me . I got fucked up by a thirteen - year - old . ”
83813	83822	83823	83823	I	3245	“ Go ahead ; laugh all you want , ”
83827	83833	83823	83823	I	3245	“ This is fucking hilarious . ”
83834	83839	83840	83840	he	73	“ It actually is , ”
83846	83852	83840	83840	he	73	“ I would say hysterical . ”
83873	83885	83870	83870	he	73	“ In all seriousness , what are you going to do ? ”
83886	83902	83903	83903	He	73	“ Well , I want to go over there and rip him a new asshole . ”
83907	83920	83903	83903	He	73	“ But I wo n’t , because Claire will kick me out . ”
83921	83928	83870	83870	he	73	“ And that ’s a problem ? ”
83929	83946	83947	83947	I	3245	“ Yes . It ’s a fucking problem . This woman has me by the balls , ”
83951	83960	83947	83947	I	3245	“ You know what I ’m doing tonight ? ”
83961	83964	83903	83903	He	73	“ What ? ”
83965	84015	84016	84016	He	73	“ Unbeknown to Claire , I ’m driving an hour to watch movies with her youngest boy . . . who is actually a pretty cool little kid , mind you , but whatever . While I pretend to the other two kids that I am just her friend . ”
84019	84048	84049	84049	He	73	“ Then , if I ’m lucky , I ’ll be allowed to sleep on the concrete lounge so that the Muff Cat can piss on my head . ”
84058	84065	84066	84066	I	3245	“ Will you stop fucking laughing ? ”
84069	84076	84077	84077	He	73	“ I ca n’t help it . ”
84080	84094	84077	84077	He	73	“ So this kid is the one who attacked you with the underpants ? ”
84095	84115	84116	84116	Jameson	73	“ No , this is the kid who hanged the teddy . . . the serial - killer one . ”
84130	84161	84116	84116	Jameson	73	“ This is fucking hilarious , Tris . I swear to God you ’re being punked or some shit . I could n’t make this shit up if I tried . ”
84176	84190	84162	84162	I	3245	“ It ’s like an elaborate plan to set me up to fail . ”
84191	84228	84229	84229	I	3245	“ Well , that ’s what he ’s doing . He wants you to stop hanging around . He ’s effectively pushing you out . Quite smart , if you ask me , and very effective . ”
84238	84246	84247	84247	He	73	“ Anyway , it ’s easily fixed . ”
84255	84271	84247	84247	He	73	“ Leave . Move on . She sounds like more trouble than she ’s worth . ”
84272	84278	84279	84279	He	73	“ Nope , not happening . ”
84285	84292	84293	84293	I	3245	“ You really like this girl ? ”
84296	84300	84293	84293	I	3245	“ I do . ”
84301	84344	84247	84247	He	73	“ Realistically , though , where is this going to go ? I mean , long term you are n’t going to be with her . Why put yourself through hell with her kids if you and she are n’t suited anyway ? ”
84345	84389	84247	84247	He	73	“ Look , I do n’t know what ’s going on with us , but I do know that I want to be with her in the right now , and a fucktard little kid is n’t winning and keeping her from me . ”
84390	84412	84293	84293	I	3245	“ What would happen if you go over there accusing him and going out of your mind like you want to ? ”
84413	84449	84450	84450	I	3245	“ She ’ll kick me out . Hands down , I come second to the kids . Actually . . . I probably come third after Woofy . No , fourth , after the Muff . ”
84455	84472	84473	84473	I	3245	“ It ’s not even a question . I do n’t even have a fucking rank . ”
84478	84486	84487	84487	He	3245	“ I am rankless in that house . ”
84507	84539	84494	84494	we	1316	“ You know , we would have pulled this shit when we were kids if Mom tried to date someone else . Can you imagine what we would have collectively done ? ”
84540	84544	84545	84545	I	3245	“ I guess . ”
84551	84573	84545	84545	I	3245	“ We ’d always conspire to get rid of our governesses . They were dropping like flies for a while there . ”
84574	84580	84581	84581	I	3245	“ Then there was Maria . ”
84584	84592	84593	84593	Jameson	73	“ She put a stop to that . ”
84596	84614	84615	84615	I	3245	“ Hottest fucking nanny I ever saw . . . I wonder what ever happened to her ? ”
84632	84638	84639	84639	I	3245	“ Unless . . . , ”
84650	84654	84639	84639	I	3245	“ Unless what ? ”
84659	84679	84655	84655	I	3245	“ Do you know where there ’s a hardware store in New York ? I need a few things . ”
84680	84683	84684	84684	I	3245	“ Why ? ”
84690	84705	84706	84706	He	3245	“ Jameson . . . if you ca n’t beat them , join them . ”
84714	84722	84723	84723	I	3245	“ Oh Jesus . Here we go . ”
84726	84738	84739	84739	I	3245	“ Whatever you are thinking , it ’s a bad idea . ”
84746	84756	84739	84739	I	3245	“ Let ’s go . We ’re doing this ! ”
84757	84763	84764	84764	I	3245	“ I ’m not involved . ”
84768	84775	84776	84776	Claire	1101	“ Oh , yes you are . ”
85026	85031	85032	85032	he	348	“ Hey , Mom , ”
85035	85045	85032	85032	he	348	“ Hi , honey . How was your day ? ”
85046	85051	85052	85052	he	348	“ Hmm , okay , ”
85055	85066	85067	85067	I	3245	“ Can I go to Justine ’s party tomorrow night ? ”
85114	85121	85102	85104	Justine ’s sisters	1323	“ What ’s the party for ? ”
85122	85132	85102	85104	Justine ’s sisters	1323	“ It ’s her birthday . She ’s fourteen . ”
85133	85142	85143	85143	He	348	“ Are her parents going to be home ? ”
85146	85153	85154	85154	I	3245	“ Um . . . yes . ”
85163	85171	85154	85154	I	3245	“ I ’ll see how you behave . ”
85172	85180	85181	85181	he	348	“ Can I , Mom , please ? ”
85184	85196	85197	85197	I	3245	“ If I behave , can I go to the party ? ”
85203	85229	85197	85197	I	3245	“ I ’m not bargaining with you to behave , Harry . You should want to behave anyway . You ’re thirteen , not two . ”
85230	85237	85154	85154	I	3245	“ Well , can I go ? ”
85238	85264	85197	85197	I	3245	“ I want you to clean up the porch for me . Put all the shoes back in the shoebox , and straighten things up . ”
85265	85270	85271	85271	he	348	“ Oh , Mom , ”
85274	85297	85271	85271	he	348	“ They are n’t even my shoes . I ’m not putting everyone else ’s shoes away . That ’s not fair . ”
85302	85307	85271	85271	he	348	“ Goodbye , Harry . ”
85308	85317	85318	85318	I	3245	“ So can I go to the party ? ”
85382	85401	85375	85375	He	901	“ Harrison , you want to be treated as an adult , but you act like a baby . ”
85402	85405	85406	85406	he	901	“ Mom , ”
85409	85414	85415	85415	he	901	“ I ’m going , ”
85418	85434	85415	85415	he	901	“ Clean the porch , and do your jobs , and we will discuss it , ”
85444	85449	85435	85435	I	3245	“ Where ’s Patrick ? ”
85450	85458	85459	85459	He	901	“ I do n’t know . Goodbye . ”

I can hear a song , and it will flip a switch , and I ’m instantly taken back . It feels so recent and so raw that I can barely breathe . It breaks me . I have no warning that it ’s about to happen , and I ca n’t stop it when it does . ”
93816	93826	93806	93806	He	1457	“ What has this got to do with me ? ”
93834	93845	93846	93846	I	3245	“ I was upset on Friday night because . . . ”
93849	93853	93846	93846	I	3245	“ Because why ? ”
93854	93881	93882	93882	His	1457	“ Because I realized I have feelings for you . I was n’t crying tears of grief , Tristan . I was crying tears of guilt . ”
93910	93918	93919	93919	I	3245	“ I thought we were just fucking , ”
93928	93947	93948	93948	he	1457	“ Claire . . . I ’ve never just fucked you . Never once have we just fucked , ”
93969	93979	93980	93980	I	3245	“ Tris , I just do n’t . . . ”
93996	94002	93980	93980	I	3245	“ You do n’t what ? ”
94003	94013	93980	93980	I	3245	“ I know that we have an expiration date . ”
94014	94017	94018	94018	He	1457	“ Why ? ”
94021	94028	94018	94018	He	1457	“ Why would you say that ? ”
94029	94045	94046	94046	I	3245	“ Because you told me yourself that all of your relationships have an expiry date . ”
94053	94062	94046	94046	I	3245	“ And besides , you are young and — ”
94063	94073	94074	94074	he	1457	“ You are only four years older than me , ”
94078	94087	94046	94046	I	3245	“ Do n’t use that as an excuse . ”
94088	94099	94046	94046	I	3245	“ You will want a family of your own soon . ”
94100	94136	94046	94046	I	3245	“ You are only thirty - eight , Claire . You could give me my own children , if that ’s what we decided . We could make it work , all of us together . ”
94145	94152	94139	94139	My	3245	“ You ’ve thought about this ? ”
94153	94163	94164	94164	he	1457	“ Of course I ’ve fucking thought about this , ”
94167	94182	94164	94164	he	1457	“ I would n’t be pursuing this if I did n’t see a future . ”
94192	94223	94183	94183	I	3245	“ Claire , you need to talk to me . Right now . This is the time , because I ’m just about to fucking walk out of your life . ”
94261	94284	94253	94253	I	3245	“ Tris . There are three other hearts connected to mine . If you leave me . . . you leave them . ”
94290	94306	94307	94307	I	3245	“ And I do n’t know if I could risk them ever losing . . . ”
94323	94342	94307	94307	I	3245	“ They would n’t survive it . They are already broken , Tristan . My sons are damaged . ”
94343	94349	94350	94350	he	3245	“ What are you saying ? ”
94353	94364	94307	94307	I	3245	“ I ’m saying you need to think about this . ”
94365	94423	94424	94424	My	3245	“ Claire , I make important decisions every day . Decisions worth millions of dollars . I am not flippant nor easily distracted . I ’ve been with a lot of women , and this thing with you — it is n’t going away . It ’s only getting stronger , and I know what I want . ”
94429	94434	94424	94424	My	3245	“ What ’s that ? ”
94435	94454	94307	94307	I	3245	“ I want you , Claire . From the moment I left Paris , I have wanted you . ”
94461	94491	94492	94492	He	3245	“ I went away and thought about my preconceived ideas and what being with you means . Nobody else interests me in the slightest , and sure . . . ”
94495	94561	94492	94492	He	3245	“ I ’ll admit it — the boys freaked me out at first . . . and I did n’t handle that too well . But then I realized that they are a part of you , and if I want you , I have to want them . I have a long way to go with them , but we ’ll get there eventually . ”
94591	94623	94586	94586	He	3245	“ Claire . When I ’m with you , I do n’t want to be anywhere else . I would rather sleep on your lounge than be alone at my apartment . ”
94627	94648	94624	94624	I	3245	“ Because I ’m close to you . . . and . . . . I ’m close to them . ”
94667	94673	94674	94674	he	3245	“ I want to try , ”
94677	94701	94674	94674	he	3245	“ I want to try the proper relationship thing — girlfriend , kids , house in the suburbs , and the mangy animals . ”
94715	94726	94702	94702	I	3245	“ I ’m a lot to take on , Tris . ”
94727	94730	94731	94731	He	3245	“ Claire . ”
94742	94753	94754	94754	he	3245	“ The way you make me feel is worth anything , ”
94786	94795	94796	94796	He	3245	“ Are you sure ? You ’re sure ? ”
94801	94804	94796	94796	He	3245	“ Positive . ”
94805	94816	94817	94817	I	3245	“ And you ’ll tell me straightaway if things change ? ”
94820	94846	94817	94817	I	3245	“ Because I completely understand if it all gets too much . I would never want you to stay if you did n’t want to . ”
94847	94853	94854	94854	I	3245	“ You have my word . ”
94873	94900	94901	94901	I	3245	“ We need some time alone to work this out . I ’m going to come and stay in New York with you for the weekend , ”
94907	94910	94904	94904	He	3245	“ How ? ”
94911	94938	94939	94939	He	3245	“ The kids can go to my parents ’ for the weekend . But Fletcher will need to take Monday off , if that ’s okay . ”
94949	94959	94960	94960	He	3245	“ He can take the whole fucking week off . ”
94986	94992	94993	94993	I	3245	“ I ’ve missed you , ”
95011	95024	95006	95006	I	3245	“ You ’re going to pay for putting me through this shit . ”
95025	95031	95032	95032	I	3245	“ I ca n’t wait , ”
95035	95043	95032	95032	I	3245	“ Do you really have a meeting ? ”
95044	95051	95052	95053	My Uber	1466	“ Fuck it — unfortunately yes . ”
95105	95113	95121	95121	I	3245	“ Hello . . . Ms. Anderson ? ”
95126	95129	95121	95121	I	3245	“ Yes ? ”
95130	95172	95121	95121	I	3245	“ I ’m Calvin , Tristan ’s driver . We met last month , on your arrival from Paris . He asked me to meet you and let you into his apartment . He ’s been held up in a meeting . ”
95173	95176	95177	95177	I	3245	“ Oh . ”
95194	95198	95199	95199	I	3245	“ Of course . ”
95202	95206	95199	95199	I	3245	“ Thank you . ”
95207	95216	95229	95229	He	3245	“ Can I take your bag for you ? ”
95217	95228	95229	95229	He	3245	“ No , thank you . I ’ve got it . ”
95236	95240	95241	95241	He	3245	“ Very well . ”
95353	95359	95347	95347	he	3245	“ This is the apartment . ”
95376	95387	95360	95360	He	3245	“ Will you be needing anything else , Ms. Anderson ? ”
95388	95391	95392	95392	I	3245	“ No . ”
95408	95412	95413	95413	He	3245	“ Thank you . ”
95421	95426	95427	95427	I	3245	“ Oh , Calvin ? ”
95430	95433	95434	95434	He	3245	“ Yes . ”
95440	95450	95451	95451	I	3245	“ Did Tristan say how long he would be ? ”
95454	95478	95451	95451	I	3245	“ I ’m going back to his office now to collect him , and in this traffic , he ’ll be another hour . ”
95479	95482	95483	95483	I	3245	“ Okay . ”
95497	95500	95501	95501	I	3245	“ Thanks . ”
95524	95528	95529	95529	I	3245	“ Holy shit , ”
95553	95569	95543	95543	Tristan	3029	“ I would rather sleep on your cement lounge than be alone in my apartment . ”
95570	95577	95578	95578	I	3245	“ You poor , stupid man , ”
95583	95591	95578	95578	I	3245	“ What could be better than here ? ”
95674	95677	95678	95678	I	3245	“ Wow . ”
95998	96001	96002	96002	I	3245	“ Wow , ”

96211	96214	96202	96202	He	3029	“ Anderson . ”
96227	96232	96233	96233	He	3029	“ You ’re late . ”
96247	96256	96239	96239	he	3029	“ And you look spectacular in my bathtub . ”

96306	96311	96312	96312	He	3029	“ At your service . ”
96439	96454	96433	96433	I	3245	“ What is that laugh ? I ’ve never heard you do that before . ”
96465	96472	96473	96473	he	3029	“ Is that a rain giggle ? ”
96489	96493	96486	96486	I	3245	“ Rain giggle ? ”
96494	96508	96509	96509	I	3245	“ You know , the one you do before you get dripping wet ? ”
96514	96518	96519	96519	I	3245	“ You idiot , ”
96522	96534	96535	96535	His	3029	“ I ’m in a bath . I am dripping wet . ”

96637	96653	96628	96628	he	3029	“ Now this is how you should greet me every day . Naked and wet . ”
96750	96759	96760	96760	he	3029	“ I want you to fuck my hand , ”
96763	96776	96760	96760	he	3029	“ You clench hard , and you fuck my fingers , Anderson . ”
96891	96895	96896	96896	I	3245	“ So good , ”

99290	99293	99284	99284	I	3245	“ Morning . ”
99303	99320	99294	99294	He	1521	“ Anderson , you ’re like a fucking rooster . Why are you awake so early ? ”
99321	99327	99328	99328	I	3245	“ Just admiring the view . ”
99418	99421	99422	99422	he	1521	“ What ? ”
99425	99433	99434	99434	He	1521	“ Nothing . . . feeling happy . ”
99456	99467	99444	99444	I	3245	“ How many women have you slept with , Tris ? ”
99468	99475	99476	99476	he	1521	“ Too many to admit to , ”
99483	99486	99487	99487	I	3245	“ Oh . ”
99509	99519	99520	99520	I	3245	“ You wore a condom , though , right ? ”
99523	99545	99546	99546	I	3245	“ Yes , Anderson , I wore a condom . You do n’t have an STD . Go back to sleep . ”
99555	99560	99546	99546	I	3245	“ You . . . ”
99574	99590	99564	99564	I	3245	“ You did n’t wear a condom with your girlfriends , though , did you ? ”
99591	99599	99600	99600	He	1521	“ Yes , I did , actually . ”
99603	99621	99600	99600	He	1521	“ Well , not my second girlfriend , but she was the only one apart from you . ”
99622	99625	99626	99626	I	3245	“ Oh . ”
99638	99649	99650	99650	I	3245	“ You loved her a lot , did n’t you ? ”
99653	99665	99666	99666	he	1521	“ Is this a Saturday morning or a Spanish fucking Inquisition ? ”
99673	99693	99666	99666	he	1521	“ I want to get to know you . I ’m going to ask you questions all day long . ”
99694	99697	99698	99698	He	1521	“ Hmm . ”
99707	99715	99716	99716	I	3245	“ You ask me a question now , ”
99719	99729	99730	99730	He	1521	“ This is how we learn about each other . ”
99745	99763	99764	99764	He	1521	“ I do n’t care what happened to you before me . I only care about us . ”
99774	99782	99783	99783	he	1521	“ Go back to sleep , Anderson , ”
99804	99825	99793	99793	I	3245	“ I ’m not tired . You go back to sleep . I ’ll keep watching you like a stalker . ”
99826	99829	99830	99830	He	1521	“ Hmm . ”
99842	99849	99830	99830	He	1521	“ You ’re a weird person . ”
99886	99893	99894	99894	I	3245	“ It ’s okay , Tris , ”
99897	99915	99916	99916	He	1521	“ I ’ve only ever murdered two men in their sleep before . You ’re completely safe . ”
99921	99938	99939	99939	I	3245	“ The fact that that even crosses your mind to say is somewhat concerning , Claire . ”
99943	99957	99958	99958	He	1521	“ Shh , go to sleep , baby . . . nighty night . ”
99986	99994	99995	99995	he	1521	“ I suppose you can help yourself , ”
100005	100022	99995	99995	he	1521	“ I am sleeping through it , though . Do n’t expect any input from me . ”
100041	100050	100030	100030	I	3245	“ Yes , dear , whatever you say . ”
100440	100446	100430	100430	Tristan	3029	“ Hello , Mr. Miles , ”
100453	100458	100459	100459	he	1305	“ Hello , Bill , ”
100597	100606	100607	100607	he	1305	“ Can I get you something to drink ? ”
100616	100624	100625	100625	he	1305	“ What do you want , babe ? ”
100630	100635	100636	100636	I	3245	“ I ’m easy , ”
100655	100658	100651	100651	I	3245	“ Red ? ”
100659	100664	100678	100678	He	1305	“ Uh - huh . ”
100665	100677	100678	100678	He	1305	“ I ’ll have a bottle of the Malbec , please . ”
100683	100696	100678	100678	He	1305	“ Excellent choice , sir . We have a batch from France . ”
100697	100701	100702	100702	He	1305	“ Thank you . ”
100725	100731	100732	100732	I	3245	“ You come here often ? ”
100738	100777	100735	100735	He	1305	“ I used to . Mainly only now when my brother Elliot is in town . Nocello is one of our favorite restaurants in Manhattan . I used to be here a lot more than I am now . ”
100784	100791	100778	100778	I	3245	“ You ’re close to Elliot ? ”
100792	100804	100778	100778	I	3245	“ Yeah , he ’s in town this weekend , actually . ”
100805	100809	100810	100810	I	3245	“ He is ? ”
100815	100850	100810	100810	I	3245	“ He and Christopher have flown in for an art auction that ’s on tomorrow night . I was going to talk to you about it , actually . Do you want to go ? ”
100855	100867	100810	100810	I	3245	“ They flew in from London just for an art auction ? ”
100868	100871	100872	100872	he	1305	“ Yeah , ”
100876	100910	100872	100872	he	1305	“ They fly around the world for art auctions . Elliot is into collecting art . He has a very impressive portfolio , actually . He started collecting back when we were kids . ”
100911	100924	100925	100925	I	3245	“ How do you start collecting art when you are a kid ? ”
100975	100978	100979	100979	He	281	“ Hmm . ”
100984	100992	100993	100994	The waiter	281	“ That ’s lovely . Thank you . ”
101041	101044	101035	101035	Tristan	3029	“ What ? ”
101045	101048	101049	101049	I	3245	“ Nothing . ”
101056	101077	101049	101049	I	3245	“ Carry on with your story . How in the hell does someone begin to collect art as a child ? ”
101078	101081	101082	101082	He	1543	“ Oh . ”
101089	101114	101082	101082	He	1543	“ He bought a picture from a yard sale with his allowance when he was fourteen , and it ended up being very valuable . ”
101119	101156	101157	101157	He	1543	“ Back in college , he would go to the art facility and buy paintings from the art students . He still has them all in storage . He has a real eye for evolving talent . ”
101171	101175	101176	101176	I	3245	“ And Christopher ? ”
101179	101186	101176	101176	I	3245	“ He ’s into art too ? ”
101187	101213	101214	101214	I	3245	“ No , he ’s just Elliot ’s art wingman . He likes the thrill of the auctions . It ’s a game to him . ”
101229	101239	101220	101220	I	3245	“ This auction tomorrow night is a big one . ”
101240	101245	101246	101246	I	3245	“ Why is that ? ”
101249	101268	101246	101246	I	3245	“ Elliot is obsessed with this artist , has all her paintings that have gone up for auction . ”
101269	101274	101220	101220	I	3245	“ Who is she ? ”
101275	101315	101316	101316	I	3245	“ We have no idea ; her name is Harriet Boucher . She ’s an older recluse , apparently . We have searched and searched for this woman . She ’s been the topic of many a drinking session . ”
101327	101337	101338	101338	He	0	“ And you think I ’m a weird person . ”
101345	101356	101338	101338	He	0	“ I suppose it does seem weird from the outside . ”
101357	101363	101364	101364	I	3245	“ So how . . . ”
101380	101384	101364	101364	I	3245	“ How what ? ”
101385	101401	101402	101402	I	3245	“ How was it decided what each of you boys would do in the company ? ”
101405	101417	101418	101418	He	0	“ Like how were the positions given to each of you ? ”
101429	101443	101444	101444	I	3245	“ I guess it was based on what we are individually good at . ”
101447	101460	101461	101461	His	0	“ Jameson is good at control . He is very . . . ”
101466	101474	101461	101461	His	0	“ You will meet him next weekend . ”
101475	101478	101479	101479	I	3245	“ When ? ”
101493	101511	101485	101485	I	3245	“ We have an industry cocktail party . I want you to come and meet my family . ”
101514	101517	101518	101518	I	3245	“ Great , ”
101564	101584	101585	101585	I	3245	“ Elliot is into the graphics of the company . He oversees the visual representation of all things Miles . ”
101588	101604	101585	101585	I	3245	“ Christopher manages human resources . He likes people . Managing staff is his thing . ”
101605	101609	101610	101610	I	3245	“ And you ? ”
101613	101618	101610	101610	I	3245	“ What about me ? ”
101619	101629	101630	101630	He	3245	“ How did you get to do the acquisitions ? ”
101636	101647	101648	101648	I	3245	“ I ’m good at numbers and taking calculated risks . ”
101653	101657	101648	101648	I	3245	“ Meaning what ? ”
101658	101691	101610	101610	I	3245	“ Well , I can look at a company and its figures and do a due diligence report , and from that I know whether the company is worth anything moving forward . ”
101692	101720	101721	101721	He	3245	“ You know , now that I know you , I ca n’t imagine you — and do n’t take this the wrong way — destroying companies . ”
101820	101845	101814	101814	I	3245	“ You know , Tris , out of all the people I have met in my life , you have been the biggest surprise . ”
101846	101851	101814	101814	I	3245	“ Why is that ? ”
101852	101864	101814	101814	I	3245	“ You ’re not at all who I thought you were . ”
101865	101873	101874	101874	I	3245	“ Who did you think I was ? ”
101882	101892	101874	101874	I	3245	“ Somebody that I could never have feelings for . ”
101899	101907	101908	101908	He	3245	“ What are those feelings , Claire ? ”
101918	101937	101908	101908	He	3245	“ You keep hinting at these feelings , but you have n’t told me what they actually are . ”
102052	102060	102061	102061	I	3245	“ You know , Tris . . . ”
102064	102101	102102	102102	He	3245	“ I do n’t want to sound insecure , because I ’m not . I ’m more than happy with who I am . But I do wonder what you see when you look at me . ”
102125	102134	102135	102135	I	3245	“ You know what I see , Claire . ”
102138	102153	102135	102135	I	3245	“ I do n’t see anything . . . it ’s how I feel . ”
102160	102171	102172	102172	He	3245	“ For the first time in my life . . . ”
102185	102193	102194	102194	I	3245	“ How do you feel , Tris ? ”
102202	102206	102197	102197	His	3245	“ Like myself . ”
102212	102231	102232	102232	I	3245	“ I feel that when I ’m with you , I ’m who I ’m supposed to be . ”
102236	102243	102244	102244	He	3245	“ It ’s like . . . ”
102247	102271	102244	102244	He	3245	“ It ’s like I ’ve gone back to being a teenager , and you ’re reprogramming everything I thought I ever knew . ”
102272	102279	102280	102280	I	3245	“ Is that a bad thing ? ”
102285	102294	102280	102280	I	3245	“ I do n’t want to reprogram you . ”
102295	102298	102299	102299	He	3245	“ No . ”
102302	102328	102299	102299	He	3245	“ Wrong choice of words . I mean , you ’re showing me what I want as opposed to what I was supposed to want . ”
102329	102335	102280	102280	I	3245	“ You mean my kids ? ”
102336	102339	102340	102340	he	3245	“ No , ”
102343	102348	102349	102349	I	3245	“ I mean you . ”
102352	102370	102371	102371	He	3245	“ You ’re everything I never knew I wanted . Feminine but strong . Your beautiful body . ”
102375	102382	102371	102371	He	3245	“ Your selflessness with your boys . ”
102394	102405	102383	102383	I	3245	“ You put everyone ’s needs before yourself , Claire . ”
102410	102430	102431	102431	I	3245	“ And for the first time in my life , you make me want to put someone before me . ”
102437	102441	102442	102442	I	3245	“ Thank you , ”
102445	102449	102442	102442	I	3245	“ For what ? ”
102450	102461	102462	102462	He	3245	“ For being everything that I thought you were n’t . ”
102465	102471	102472	102472	He	3245	“ No , thank you . ”
102479	102489	102490	102490	I	3245	“ For being exactly who I thought you were . ”
102495	102501	102502	102502	He	3245	“ Who , a bitch ? ”
102511	102520	102505	102505	he	3245	“ A raving bitch with a magical vagina . ”
102555	102561	102550	102550	I	3245	“ Do I look okay ? ”
102607	102618	102619	102619	he	3029	“ You looking fucking hot , Anderson . Stop it , ”
102733	102738	102727	102727	We	1553	“ There they are . ”
102795	102798	102799	102799	Tristan	3029	“ Hey . ”
102819	102822	102807	102807	They	3042	“ Tris . ”
102832	102837	102838	102838	Tristan	3029	“ This is Claire . ”
102842	102854	102838	102838	Tristan	3029	“ This is Elliot and Christopher , my two younger brothers . ”
102855	102858	102859	102859	I	3245	“ Hi , ”
102892	102897	102898	102898	Elliot	1305	“ Hello , Claire . ”
102904	102910	102911	102911	He	1305	“ Lovely to meet you . ”
102925	102928	102911	102911	He	1305	“ Hi . ”
102941	102963	102964	102964	Christopher	130	“ Hi , Claire . I ’ve heard a lot about you . So lovely to finally get to meet you . ”
102989	102994	102979	102979	He	130	“ So . . . ”
103007	103017	102998	102998	he	130	“ What have you two been doing all weekend ? ”
103058	103064	103046	103046	God	78	“ Oh , you know . ”
103075	103085	103086	103086	Christopher	130	“ Bit of this and a bit of that . ”
103134	103141	103118	103118	Tristan	3029	“ So this is Harriet Boucher ? ”
103159	103164	103148	103148	he	1305	“ This is her . ”
103172	103179	103180	103180	Tristan	3029	“ Spectacular , is n’t it ? ”
103188	103195	103196	103196	Christopher	130	“ Meh , it ’s okay . ”
103199	103213	103214	103214	Tristan	3029	“ I could take it or leave it , to be honest too . ”
103230	103238	103223	103223	Elliot	1305	“ What do you think , Claire ? ”
103239	103249	103250	103250	I	3245	“ Beauty is in the eye of the beholder , ”
103266	103272	103253	103253	He	1305	“ Yes , it is . ”
103273	103282	103283	103283	I	3245	“ Tristan says that you love this artist ? ”
103291	103295	103296	103296	He	1305	“ I do . ”
103303	103324	103296	103296	He	1305	“ Not love her as such , but I admire her work . She is by far my favorite artist . ”
103325	103328	103329	103329	He	1305	“ Why ? ”
103337	103345	103346	103346	He	1305	“ I guess . . . hmm . ”
103352	103365	103346	103346	He	1305	“ Her paintings speak to me . I ca n’t explain it . ”
103380	103384	103385	103385	His	1305	“ How romantic . ”
103391	103394	103385	103385	His	1305	“ Really ? ”
103395	103417	103418	103418	He	1305	“ If I were an artist , all I would want in life is for my paintings to speak to someone . ”
103429	103433	103418	103418	He	1305	“ I suppose . ”
103434	103440	103441	103441	I	3245	“ So you know her ? ”
103444	103473	103441	103441	I	3245	“ No , I ’ve never seen her . I go to every auction , but she never attends . She ’s elderly , from what I know . ”
103474	103484	103485	103485	I	3245	“ And you have a few of her paintings ? ”
103488	103523	103485	103485	I	3245	“ I ’ve bought five at auctions , although there are thirty in circulation . It is my aim to own all of them at some stage . They never come up for sale . ”

104993	105022	105023	105023	He	3029	“ Surely not . And do n’t get any ideas . That is not happening . My children will never know that we have sex . Like ever . ”

105056	105070	105071	105071	I	3245	“ Because I know what a horny fuckmaster two thousand their mother is . ”
105078	105085	105071	105071	I	3245	“ A horny fuckmaster two thousand ? ”
105086	105096	105044	105044	He	3029	“ Yes , it ’s the latest sex toy . ”
105097	105105	105071	105071	I	3245	“ And what does this toy do ? ”

105210	105218	105219	105219	He	3029	“ You must be a faulty model . ”
105224	105229	105219	105219	He	3029	“ Why is that ? ”
105230	105250	105251	105251	I	3245	“ The horny fuckmaster two thousand does n’t speak . I specifically asked for one without a voice box . ”
105257	105265	105251	105251	I	3245	“ Go to work , you fool . ”
105470	105473	105474	105474	Patrick	372	“ Tristan ! ”
105479	105482	105474	105474	Patrick	372	“ Hello . ”

105527	105534	105535	105535	Tristan	3029	“ Well , that ’s funny , ”
105538	105551	105552	105552	I	3245	“ Because I booked the restaurant , and I booked for five . ”
105561	105570	105571	105571	Harry	348	“ This is a family - only dinner , ”
105576	105582	105583	105583	Patrick	372	“ Be quiet , Harry , ”
105586	105592	105583	105583	Patrick	372	“ You ’re ruining everything . ”
105593	105598	105599	105599	Tristan	3029	“ Yes , Wiz , ”

105664	105667	105668	105668	I	3245	“ Hello , ”
105671	105674	105675	105675	He	3029	“ Hi . ”

105756	105766	105767	105767	he	348	“ Oh great , this is all I need , ”
105770	105776	105767	105767	he	348	“ The night is ruined . ”
105777	105785	105786	105786	I	3245	“ Do n’t be rude , Harry , ”
105790	105805	105786	105786	I	3245	“ Tristan is my friend , and I invited him to come with us . ”
105806	105811	105812	105812	he	348	“ Who knows why , ”
105818	105825	105826	105826	I	3245	“ We leave in ten minutes , ”
105829	105838	105826	105826	I	3245	“ Would you like a drink , Tristan ? ”
105839	105844	105845	105845	he	348	“ Yes , please , ”
105848	105853	105845	105845	he	348	“ Lead the way . ”
105907	105914	105915	105915	I	3245	“ To drinking on Monday nights . ”
105922	105942	105943	105943	He	3029	“ You ’re a bad influence on me , Mr. Miles . I never drink on a school night . ”
105952	105973	105943	105943	He	3029	“ What am I exactly allowed to say to the wizard ? Give me some boundaries to work with here . ”
105974	105977	105978	105978	I	3245	“ Nothing , ”
105981	106053	106054	106054	I	3245	“ You will be the adult in the relationship ; he ’s just a child . A confused , angry , naughty little boy . He ’s unsettled , and he does n’t like change . Like most kids , he acts up out of fear . He needs time to adjust . . . but he will come around and see how wonderful you are . I know he will . ”
106068	106077	106054	106054	I	3245	“ You need to be patient with him . ”
106078	106083	106084	106084	He	1611	“ What , nothing ? ”
106087	106092	106084	106084	He	1611	“ Not one word ? ”
106093	106096	106097	106097	He	1611	“ No . ”
106102	106112	106113	106113	I	3245	“ Why ? What would you like to say ? ”
106116	106122	106123	106123	He	1611	“ I do n’t know . ”
106126	106176	106177	106177	He	1611	“ Put yourself in my shoes for a moment . If this was your daughter , and I was coming into her house , what would you want me to do with her . . . be patient , or fight with her and put you in the middle ? ”
106193	106254	106255	106255	Tristan	3029	“ I just want you to ignore him , Tris . He ’s baiting you for a fight . And I can defend you if you ’re ignoring him and being the adult , but if you get into an open fight with a thirteen - year - old . . . I ’m on his side . Every time . ”
106267	106281	106282	106282	He	3029	“ First rule of being a mom : the kids always come first . ”
106287	106294	106282	106282	He	3029	“ When do I come first ? ”
106295	106301	106302	106302	I	3245	“ When we ’re alone , ”
106305	106315	106316	106316	he	3029	“ What do I get for not strangling him ? ”
106319	106322	106323	106323	I	3245	“ Me . ”
106329	106334	106335	106335	He	3029	“ All of me . ”
106345	106354	106335	106335	He	3029	“ You drive a hard bargain , Anderson . ”
106374	106385	106363	106363	I	3245	“ I just wish I could kiss you right now . ”
106386	106397	106398	106398	He	3029	“ So . . . we ca n’t even kiss ? ”
106401	106408	106398	106398	He	3029	“ What can we fucking do ? ”
106409	106418	106419	106419	He	3029	“ Not until they know we are dating . ”
106429	106439	106440	106440	He	3029	“ That ’ll do me . Let ’s go . ”
106448	106456	106457	106457	he	3029	“ Come on , we ’re leaving , ”
106485	106493	106494	106494	he	3029	“ I ’m having dessert for dinner , ”
106497	106503	106504	106504	Tristan	3029	“ Oh , good idea , ”
106507	106524	106525	106525	I	3245	“ Me too . Let ’s all do that — sugar coma , here we come . ”
106566	106582	106583	106583	he	3029	“ You got a coat , Mama ? It ’s going to get cold out , ”
106586	106597	106583	106583	he	3029	“ I do n’t need one . I ’m fine . ”
106610	106616	106617	106617	I	3245	“ What are you doing ? ”
106622	106628	106629	106629	I	3245	“ Getting you a coat . ”
106647	106653	106644	106644	he	3029	“ I told you so . ”
106678	106686	106666	106666	He	3029	“ Come on , let ’s go . ”
106718	106724	106707	106707	He	372	“ Climb in the back . ”
106734	106746	106747	106747	Harry	348	“ We ’re not going to fit into this sardine car , ”
106750	106764	106765	106765	Tristan	3029	“ This is not a sardine car ; it ’s an Aston Martin , ”
106771	106793	106765	106765	Tristan	3029	“ Nothing fishy about it , although I can always arrange a seat in the trunk , if you would prefer . ”
106803	106813	106814	106814	Harry	348	“ Climb in , baby . It ’s fine . ”
106822	106831	106832	106832	Tristan	3029	“ You get in the middle , Tricky , ”
106840	106846	106835	106835	Patrick	372	“ Now you , Fletch . ”
106883	106891	106892	106892	he	3029	“ Great , they do n’t fit , ”
106904	106911	106912	106912	I	3245	“ We can take my car , ”
106915	106924	106925	106925	he	3029	“ It will be fine this one time , ”
107013	107022	107023	107023	he	3029	“ Hello , booking for Miles , please , ”
107026	107031	107032	107032	Harry	348	“ It ’s Anderson , ”
107036	107056	107057	107057	he	3029	“ There are four Andersons and only one Miles . It ’s hardly a Miles booking , is it ? ”
107085	107092	107093	107093	I	3245	“ That ’s enough , Harry , ”
107104	107108	107093	107093	I	3245	“ Your table . ”
107109	107113	107114	107114	Tristan	3029	“ Thank you . ”
107117	107121	107122	107122	Fletcher	1305	“ Sit here . ”
107138	107147	107148	107148	Patrick	372	“ I want to sit next to Tristan , ”
107158	107168	107169	107169	Tristan	3029	“ Tristan , sit next to me , please . ”
107176	107188	107189	107189	Harry	348	“ To save arguments , I ’m sitting next to Mom . ”
107216	107230	107231	107231	he	372	“ There ’s a reason I wanted to have dinner tonight , Claire , ”
107246	107250	107243	107243	I	3245	“ There is ? ”
107256	107259	107260	107260	He	372	“ Yes . ”
107272	107288	107260	107260	He	372	“ I was wondering if you would like to go out with me next weekend . ”
107293	107299	107300	107300	Harry	348	“ Like on a date ? ”
107305	107308	107309	107309	Tristan	3029	“ Yes , ”
107314	107336	107309	107309	Tristan	3029	“ Like on a date . I would like to be your boyfriend , Claire Anderson . What do you say ? ”
107339	107350	107351	107351	Harry	348	“ She says no . That ’s what she says , ”
107354	107371	107351	107351	Harry	348	“ What a stupid question — as if she would go out with you , anyway . ”
107400	107403	107396	107396	He	3029	“ Well ? ”
107404	107409	107410	107410	I	3245	“ I . . . ”
107438	107447	107429	107429	Fletcher	1305	“ I . . . umm . . . ”
107448	107463	107464	107464	Tristan	3029	“ Well , you did say you were ready to have a friend again , ”
107467	107487	107488	107488	I	3245	“ Someone to go to the movies and out to dinner with . A boyfriend , if you will . ”
107500	107512	107513	107513	he	286	“ And as I see it , you have four choices , ”
107519	107523	107516	107516	I	3245	“ I do ? ”
107524	107527	107528	107528	He	286	“ Yes . ”
107536	107549	107550	107550	He	286	“ You can go out with that man you met in Paris . ”
107563	107578	107550	107550	He	286	“ However , that would mean that you all have to move to France . ”
107588	107613	107579	107579	He	286	“ And of course , Muff Cat and Woofy ca n’t move to Paris , so they would have to move in with me . ”
107622	107630	107631	107631	Harry	348	“ I am not moving to Paris , ”
107637	107641	107642	107642	Fletcher	1305	“ Me neither , ”
107646	107652	107642	107642	Fletcher	1305	“ No way in hell . ”
107653	107657	107659	107659	Patrick	372	“ Me three , ”
107676	107689	107690	107690	I	3245	“ I do n’t know ; Paris may be good for us . ”
107693	107699	107700	107700	Harry	348	“ No way , Mom , ”
107704	107724	107700	107700	Harry	348	“ You can forget about it . I ’m calling Grandma ; she wo n’t like this at all . ”
107725	107732	107733	107733	I	3245	“ What are the other choices ? ”
107740	107749	107750	107750	he	3029	“ You could go out with Pilates Paul , ”
107753	107760	107761	107761	I	3245	“ Oh , he ’s nice . ”
107765	107774	107775	107775	Tristan	3029	“ I do like him . Great choice . ”
107781	107788	107789	107789	he	3029	“ He ’s boring , Claire , ”
107793	107800	107789	107789	he	3029	“ But so handsome , right ? ”
107816	107823	107824	107824	Harry	348	“ I ’m getting a headache , ”
107832	107837	107838	107838	Fletcher	1305	“ No , Mom , ”
107841	107858	107838	107838	Fletcher	1305	“ That ’s just embarrassing . He wears a pink sweatband around his head to Pilates . ”
107859	107862	107863	107863	Tristan	3029	“ Yes , ”
107866	107882	107863	107863	Tristan	3029	“ Exactly my point , Fletch . He will bring the Anderson name into disrepute . ”
107883	107890	107892	107892	Patrick	372	“ He is weird , Mom , ”
107894	107901	107902	107902	I	3245	“ You have to admit it . ”
107909	107918	107902	107902	I	3245	“ Okay , what is my other choice ? ”
107919	107929	107930	107930	I	3245	“ You could meet someone new who has kids . ”
107945	107984	107939	107939	he	1305	“ But whenever he comes over , he will bring his children , and they will have to have a bedroom to stay in . So Harry and Patrick will have to share a bedroom from now on . ”
108000	108009	108010	108010	he	1305	“ Why does Fletcher get his own room ? ”
108023	108042	108043	108043	He	1305	“ Because Fletcher is an adult , and he needs his own room . But then . . . ”
108054	108070	108043	108043	He	1305	“ Those other kids will use a lot of internet , maybe all the data . ”
108088	108122	108084	108084	he	1305	“ They ’ll also eat all of the food , and they wo n’t have a skateboard or bike at your house , so you will have to share all of your things . ”
108134	108143	108084	108084	he	1305	“ That ’s if they are n’t girls . ”
108144	108147	108148	108148	Harry	348	“ Girls ? ”
108157	108177	108178	108178	he	1305	“ No way . You are not going out with anyone with kids , Mom . I forbid it , ”
108184	108187	108178	108178	he	1305	“ Oh . ”
108195	108208	108188	108188	I	3245	“ I kind of liked the idea of having more kids around . ”
108209	108213	108214	108214	Tristan	3029	“ Or not , ”
108220	108223	108214	108214	Tristan	3029	“ Well . ”
108235	108242	108224	108224	I	3245	“ What is my last choice ? ”
108243	108246	108214	108214	Tristan	3029	“ Me . ”
108247	108259	108260	108260	I	3245	“ And why should I pick you to be my boyfriend ? ”
108263	108273	108274	108274	he	1305	“ That ’s a very good question , Claire , ”
108290	108300	108277	108277	he	1305	“ I have prepared a list of my attributes . ”
108330	108336	108337	108337	Patrick	372	“ I ’m good looking . ”
108344	108352	108353	108353	He	372	“ It ’s true ; you are . ”
108360	108364	108365	108365	Harry	348	“ Oh God , ”
108368	108373	108365	108365	Harry	348	“ Here we go . ”
108374	108392	108393	108393	I	3245	“ You do n’t have to move to another country and leave your pets homeless and vulnerable . ”
108402	108414	108397	108397	Fletcher	1305	“ You do n’t have to share a bedroom with anyone . ”
108415	108423	108424	108424	Harry	348	“ I ’m not doing that anyway , ”
108429	108438	108424	108424	Harry	348	“ Do n’t get any ideas , Mom . ”
108439	108447	108448	108448	he	372	“ I ’m getting a bigger car , ”
108451	108455	108456	108456	I	3245	“ You are ? ”
108468	108479	108480	108480	He	372	“ Show me where it says that on the list . ”
108489	108504	108505	108505	I	3245	“ That was a recently added point , Claire . Do n’t interrupt me . ”
108508	108513	108514	108514	He	372	“ I ’m fun . ”
108539	108545	108546	108546	Harry	348	“ You are not fun , ”
108549	108554	108555	108555	Tristan	3029	“ You ’re boring . ”
108563	108577	108555	108555	Tristan	3029	“ How am I boring ? Name one time I have been boring . ”
108578	108586	108587	108587	Harry	348	“ Right now . This is boring , ”
108591	108596	108597	108597	Tristan	3029	“ You ’re boring , ”
108601	108613	108597	108597	Tristan	3029	“ Shut up , Wizard , and listen to my points . ”
108614	108622	108623	108623	Patrick	372	“ He ’s not boring , Mom , ”
108635	108680	108623	108623	Patrick	372	“ I live in New York , so I can come and visit you , and you can come to my house and visit me , if you like . Nobody has to move anywhere , and it ’s no big deal to visit . ”
108686	108689	108690	108690	he	372	“ And , ”
108693	108700	108701	108701	I	3245	“ I am an excellent cook . ”
108704	108708	108690	108690	he	372	“ You cook ? ”
108709	108717	108718	108718	He	372	“ Yes . Yes , I do . ”
108727	108754	108718	108718	He	372	“ My specialty is baking brownies and chocolate cake . They asked me to make a cookbook on chocolate desserts once , which I gracefully declined . ”
108769	108777	108778	108778	I	3245	“ Well . I ’m very impressed , ”
108781	108789	108778	108778	I	3245	“ You do have some excellent assets . ”
108790	108794	108795	108795	He	372	“ I do . ”

108848	108856	108857	108857	Harry	348	“ I did n’t agree to this , ”
108860	108886	108887	108887	he	372	“ No , Wiz , you have to pick one for Mom . Think very carefully about it , and remember , majority vote wins , ”
108918	108933	108934	108934	I	3245	“ All in favor of you moving to France , hold your hands up . ”
108955	108958	108959	108959	he	372	“ Okay , ”
108968	108983	108984	108984	Everyone	366	“ All those in favor of sharing bedrooms and internet , raise your hands . ”
108988	109005	109006	109006	He	372	“ All those in favor of me being your mom ’s boyfriend , raise your hand . ”
109054	109065	109066	109066	I	3245	“ So . . . what are my other options ? ”
109075	109080	109081	109081	he	3029	“ Pathetic Pilates Paul , ”
109084	109094	109095	109095	I	3245	“ Oh , I do like him , though , ”
109103	109117	109098	109098	Tristan	3029	“ But I guess between you and him , I would prefer you . ”
109148	109158	109159	109159	Tristan	3029	“ What ’s it going to be , Wiz ? ”
109162	109169	109170	109170	Harry	348	“ Who are you voting for ? ”

109251	109282	109283	109283	Harry	348	“ I can drop you at Pilates Paul ’s house on the way home , if you wish . I ’m sure he has a spare pink headband for you . ”
109307	109319	109293	109293	Tristan	3029	“ Well , I have to say I ’m very relieved . ”
109344	109352	109353	109353	he	3029	“ What are you ordering , boys ? ”

110758	110773	110774	110775	Drunk driver	1663	“ It ’s very dark , and . . . it ’s not safe . ”
110787	110801	110802	110802	I	3245	“ Darling , it ’s okay . There ’s no need to worry , ”
110813	110820	110821	110821	he	372	“ What if something goes wrong ? ”
110829	110839	110824	110824	he	372	“ Bad things happen to good people , Mom . ”
110859	110868	110869	110869	He	372	“ You ’re worried about me driving home ? ”
110904	110907	110893	110893	Tristan	3029	“ Okay . ”
110908	110912	110913	110913	Patrick	372	“ Okay what ? ”
110916	110925	110926	110926	I	3245	“ Okay , I wo n’t go home . ”
110943	110954	110929	110929	He	372	“ Come on . I ’ll sleep on the couch . ”
110955	110968	110969	110969	I	3245	“ Tris , it ’s okay . You do n’t have to , ”
110978	111001	111002	111002	He	372	“ Yeah , I do , Claire . I do n’t want him to worry about anything , least of all me . ”
111254	111257	111240	111240	she	1672	“ Hi . ”
111269	111272	111261	111261	she	1672	“ Hi . ”
111357	111364	111365	111365	she	1672	“ I love you , Tristan , ”
111381	111391	111368	111368	I	3245	“ A . . . great deal , actually . ”
111392	111401	111402	111402	I	3245	“ It ’s about fucking time , Anderson , ”
111443	111448	111439	111439	she	1672	“ I . . . ”
111457	111466	111467	111467	she	1672	“ This is n’t about how you feel , ”
111472	111527	111467	111467	she	1672	“ This is about me . . . loving you . I wanted to tell you , and I know it ’s premature . But I ca n’t hold it in anymore . It does n’t matter how you feel about me , but I wanted you to know how I feel about you . ”
111583	111590	111570	111570	My	3245	“ This needs to be celebrated . ”
111591	111595	111596	111596	She	1676	“ I know . ”
111602	111608	111596	111596	She	1676	“ But we ca n’t . ”
111613	111617	111618	111618	she	1676	“ Not yet , ”
111621	111631	111632	111632	I	3245	“ Can you lie with me for a while ? ”
111635	111641	111642	111642	She	1676	“ I can do that . ”
111739	111744	111745	111745	I	3245	“ That went well , ”
111776	111780	111781	111781	Fletcher	1305	“ It did , ”
111784	111790	111791	111791	I	3245	“ Watch what happens now , ”
111794	111806	111791	111791	I	3245	“ They will suddenly be urgent for the takeover to happen . ”
111807	111812	111791	111791	I	3245	“ Why is that ? ”
111813	111845	111791	111791	I	3245	“ This is what happens — they resist and resist so that by the time we take over , they are so over it that they just want to get out . ”
111846	111850	111851	111851	Fletcher	1305	“ No way , ”
111875	111878	111879	111879	I	3245	“ What ? ”
111893	111901	111882	111882	I	3245	“ That ’s Harrison ’s screen saver . ”
111902	111906	111907	111907	I	3245	“ What is ? ”
111910	111924	111907	111907	I	3245	“ The rocket . It ’s a model that you have to build . ”
111925	111928	111929	111929	I	3245	“ Huh ? ”
111953	111961	111962	111962	I	3245	“ Harry likes this kind of thing ? ”
111965	112007	111962	111962	I	3245	“ This is his ultimate . Mom wo n’t buy it for him because she says he wo n’t be able to do it . It ’s way too hard . He ’s asked for it two Christmases in a row . ”
112022	112026	112027	112027	I	3245	“ Very interesting , ”
112033	112050	112051	112051	Fletcher	1305	“ Wait till I send him the pic . He ’s going to go batshit crazy , ”
112064	112077	112078	112078	Fletch	160	“ That ’s a normal state for him , is n’t it ? ”
112081	112085	112078	112078	Fletch	160	“ I guess . ”
112086	112093	112094	112094	I	3245	“ Let ’s check it out . ”
112115	112121	112122	112127	an old man with white hair	622	“ Can I help you ? ”
112138	112152	112130	112130	He	622	“ Yes , I was interested in the spaceship model in the window . ”
112153	112156	112157	112157	He	622	“ Oh . ”
112163	112181	112157	112157	He	622	“ That ’s for experienced modelers only . I doubt you would be able to complete it . ”
112198	112213	112191	112191	you	1686	“ And what makes you think we would n’t be able to do this ? ”
112214	112217	112218	112218	He	622	“ Well . ”
112225	112235	112218	112218	He	622	“ I can see you are not a modeler . ”
112236	112240	112191	112191	you	1686	“ How so ? ”
112241	112244	112245	112245	He	622	“ Well . ”
112255	112266	112245	112245	He	622	“ Your suits tell me you are in big business . ”
112283	112289	112290	112290	I	3245	“ We ’ll take it , ”
112293	112298	112290	112290	I	3245	“ I must advise — ”
112299	112304	112305	112305	I	3245	“ Wrap it up , ”
112315	112319	112320	112320	He	622	“ Very well . ”
112326	112330	112331	112331	I	3245	“ Old wanker , ”
112334	112340	112341	112341	Fletcher	1305	“ I know , right ? ”
112361	112373	112349	112349	he	622	“ That will be six hundred and twenty - five dollars . ”
112374	112377	112378	112378	My	3245	“ What ? ”
112382	112387	112388	112388	He	622	“ For a toy ? ”
112409	112412	112413	112413	I	3245	“ Fine , ”
112422	112435	112413	112413	I	3245	“ This better take us to the moon when it ’s built . ”
112436	112442	112443	112443	He	622	“ If it ’s built . ”
112460	112483	112484	112484	He	622	“ You know , it would n’t hurt to brush up on your customer service . . . it ’s severely lacking . ”
112488	112522	112484	112484	He	622	“ We do n’t do returns , so when you realize I was right and you were wrong , do n’t ask for your money back , Mr. . . . Big Business . ”
112550	112553	112554	112554	he	622	“ Goodbye , ”
112575	112582	112564	112564	We	1689	“ What ’s his fucking problem ? ”
112587	112594	112583	112583	I	3245	“ I hate that old bastard . ”
112595	112609	112625	112625	Sammia	144	“ Yeah , well , I ’m pretty sure he hates you too . ”
112610	112624	112625	112625	Sammia	144	“ Tristan , your mother is on her way down to your office . ”
112633	112638	112625	112625	Sammia	144	“ Thanks , Sam . ”
112658	112662	112663	112663	I	3245	“ Come in , ”
112680	112685	112676	112676	I	3245	“ Hello , Mom . ”
112695	112700	112701	112701	She	689	“ Hello , darling . ”
112705	112716	112717	112717	I	3245	“ I just came to check on my favorite son . ”
112740	112751	112752	112752	I	3245	“ Take a seat . Do you want some tea ? ”
112755	112765	112766	112766	She	689	“ Yes , please , that would be lovely . ”
112779	112796	112774	112774	I	3245	“ Sammia , can you ask someone to bring in some tea for Mom , please ? ”
112797	112801	112766	112766	She	689	“ Sure can . ”
112802	112805	112806	112806	My	3245	“ Thanks . ”
112814	112819	112806	112806	My	3245	“ So . . . ”
112820	112825	112826	112826	She	751	“ So . . . ”
112834	112847	112826	112826	She	751	“ I ’ve had a hysterical Melina at our apartment all day . ”
112848	112852	112853	112853	I	3245	“ Oh God . ”
112858	112872	112853	112853	I	3245	“ Do n’t roll your eyes , Tristan . She ’s very hurt . ”
112873	112876	112877	112877	I	3245	“ Mom . ”
112882	112890	112877	112877	I	3245	“ We broke up six months ago . ”
112891	112898	112853	112853	I	3245	“ You were taking a break . ”
112899	112945	112946	112946	She	751	“ There ’s no such thing as a break , Mom . That ’s what you say to try and make it less painful . As soon as you hear the word break . . . it means it ’s over . Everyone knows that . ”
112954	112957	112946	112946	She	751	“ What ? ”
112958	112966	112972	112972	I	3245	“ She said you ’re seeing someone . ”
112967	112971	112972	112972	I	3245	“ I am . ”
112990	112998	112987	112987	we	1695	“ Why have n’t you told me ? ”
112999	113014	113015	113015	I	3245	“ Because you ’re still playing tea parties with Melina three times a week . ”
113018	113036	113037	113037	She	751	“ And I do n’t need anyone ’s approval , Mom . . . not this time . ”
113055	113060	113061	113061	I	3245	“ Who is she ? ”
113075	113081	113066	113066	I	3245	“ Her name is Claire . ”
113082	113088	113089	113089	I	3245	“ And who is Claire . ”
113092	113099	113100	113100	She	751	“ Somebody . . . special . ”
113105	113112	113100	113100	She	751	“ It ’s serious , then ? ”
113113	113116	113066	113066	I	3245	“ Yes . ”
113117	113122	113100	113100	She	751	“ She ’s divorced ? ”
113123	113141	113142	113142	I	3245	“ Widowed . Three boys . And yes , Mom , I ’m in love with her , ”
113151	113157	113145	113145	Her	751	“ How old is she ? ”
113165	113173	113145	113145	Her	751	“ How old is she , Tristan ? ”
113174	113179	113184	113184	She	751	“ Thirty - eight . ”
113180	113183	113184	113184	She	751	“ So — ”
113189	113202	113184	113184	She	751	“ So what , Mom ? What do you want to say ? ”
113203	113206	113207	113207	She	751	“ Tristan . ”
113217	113250	113207	113207	She	751	“ If you end up with this woman , you wo n’t have children of your own . She does n’t have much time — that ’s if she even wanted to . ”
113251	113255	113256	113256	I	3245	“ Probably not . ”
113267	113275	113260	113260	I	3245	“ And you ’re okay with this ? ”
113276	113333	113207	113207	She	751	“ I have to be , Mom . It is what it is , and I ca n’t turn off my feelings for her . I tried that already . And perhaps she could , Mom . She ’s only thirty - eight , and you never know . We may be blessed with a child . ”
113334	113337	113338	113338	she	1696	“ Tris , ”
113341	113373	113374	113374	I	3245	“ It will take years for her to be ready to start again with another man . By then it will be too late . Deep down you already know that . ”
113384	113388	113374	113374	I	3245	“ Do n’t . ”
113389	113398	113207	113207	She	751	“ How can I not worry , darling ? ”
113399	113402	113403	113403	I	3245	“ Mom . ”
113406	113444	113445	113445	Her	1696	“ Trust me on this . Claire is nothing like anyone I ’ve ever dated before . You will like her . There ’s a lot to like about this woman . . . everything , actually . ”
113451	113460	113461	113461	She	1696	“ I ’m bringing her on Saturday night . ”
113466	113472	113461	113461	She	1696	“ What does that mean ? ”
113473	113487	113488	113488	She	1696	“ It means . . . I ’ll see you on Saturday night . ”
113491	113496	113488	113488	She	1696	“ You ’re leaving ? ”
113497	113500	113501	113501	She	1696	“ Yes . ”
113516	113536	113504	113504	I	3245	“ And cut ties with Melina , please . She ’s my ex - girlfriend . It ’s weird . ”
113537	113561	113562	113562	I	3245	“ Tristan , I ’m friends with all of your ex - girlfriends . I ca n’t just cut them off like you . ”
113567	113597	113562	113562	I	3245	“ I just do n’t know how you can be so coldhearted to these women who love you . My heart breaks for them . Melina is absolutely devastated . ”
113598	113605	113606	113606	I	3245	“ She ’ll get over it . ”
113614	113639	113606	113606	I	3245	“ She does n’t love me , Mom . She loves my money and my surname . Just like the rest of them did . ”
113647	113654	113655	113655	she	689	“ Why would you say that ? ”
113658	113679	113680	113680	She	689	“ Because it ’s the truth . You be nice to Claire . . . she ’s important to me . ”
113690	113701	113680	113680	She	689	“ I want my son to have his own family . ”
113702	113707	113708	113708	I	3245	“ And I will , ”
113711	113723	113724	113724	She	689	“ It just may not fit into your perfect little box . ”
113752	113755	113756	113756	I	3245	“ Hello , ”
113767	113770	113771	113771	he	1305	“ Hi , ”
113775	113784	113771	113771	he	1305	“ I ’ve got the tea you wanted . ”

113804	113809	113810	113810	He	1305	“ Bring it in . ”
113839	113847	113848	113848	he	1305	“ I heard what your mother said , ”
113860	113868	113852	113852	I	3245	“ I ’m sorry . Ignore her . ”
113869	113880	113881	113881	His	1305	“ She does n’t want you to date my mom ? ”
113889	113898	113899	113899	he	1305	“ You do n’t want your own kids ? ”
113902	113906	113907	113907	I	3245	“ I do . ”
113916	113924	113907	113907	I	3245	“ But I want your mother more . ”
114330	114335	114336	114336	Marley	100	“ Just this way , ”
114359	114365	114341	114342	A man	284	“ Delivery for Claire Anderson . ”
114366	114371	114372	114372	I	3245	“ That ’s me , ”
114401	114407	114393	114393	He	284	“ Sign here , please . ”
114415	114419	114420	114420	I	3245	“ Thank you . ”
114424	114441	114442	114442	Marley	100	“ You ’re welcome . Although I have an admission . I did n’t buy them . ”
114529	114535	114515	114515	She	100	“ What does that mean ? ”
114541	114548	114549	114549	She	100	“ To be loved by you . ”
114559	114564	114565	114565	I	3245	“ You love him ? ”
114572	114580	114581	114581	She	100	“ You told him you love him ? ”
114593	114610	114584	114584	I	3245	“ Yes , Marley . I admit it ; I ’m in love with Tristan Miles . ”
114630	114639	114640	114640	she	100	“ Well . . . holy fucking shit , ”
114651	114658	114643	114643	she	100	“ I was not expecting that . ”
114659	114663	114643	114643	she	100	“ Me neither . ”
114664	114671	114672	114672	She	100	“ So . . . what ? ”
114688	114702	114680	114680	she	100	“ I mean , I knew you had that week of lunch fucks . ”
114709	114720	114703	114703	I	3245	“ Sounds so romantic when you put it like that . ”
114721	114728	114729	114729	She	100	“ You know what I mean . ”
114732	114755	114729	114729	She	100	“ But what happened then ? And more importantly , why the fuck have n’t you told me about any of this ? ”
114756	114775	114703	114703	I	3245	“ I was just waiting to see what happened , and I did n’t want to jinx it . ”
114776	114780	114729	114729	She	100	“ Jinx it ? ”
114781	114803	114729	114729	She	100	“ Well , sometimes when you put something out there , it does n’t turn out how you expect it to . ”
114804	114814	114815	114815	She	100	“ So . . . this is turning out ? ”
114820	114825	114826	114826	I	3245	“ Oh , Marley , ”
114836	114844	114845	114845	I	3245	“ Tristan is just so . . . ”
114852	114875	114876	114876	She	100	“ Funny and sweet and understanding , and he sleeps on the couch at my house out of respect for my kids . ”
114884	114888	114876	114876	She	100	“ Tristan Miles ? ”
114889	114894	114906	114906	she	100	“ Uh - huh . ”
114895	114905	114906	114906	she	100	“ Tristan Miles , the arrogant , gorgeous playboy ? ”
114921	114928	114929	114929	She	100	“ Yep , that ’s him . ”
114934	114953	114954	114954	I	3245	“ I ’m so confused . I thought he was a hot player who had excellent fucking capabilities . ”
114959	114974	114954	114954	I	3245	“ He ’s all of those things , but there ’s more to him . ”
114992	114999	115000	115000	I	3245	“ To be loved by you . ”
115024	115032	115021	115021	she	100	“ I love seeing you like this . ”
115033	115046	115021	115021	she	100	“ Like what , all dreamy and starry eyed like a schoolgirl ? ”
115047	115050	115051	115051	I	3245	“ Happy . ”
115055	115062	115063	115063	I	3245	“ Thanks . I really am . ”
115101	115117	115118	115118	I	3245	“ I ’m meeting his family on Saturday night at a black - tie dinner , ”
115121	115125	115126	115126	Her	100	“ Oh jeez . ”
115130	115136	115126	115126	Her	100	“ What are you wearing ? ”
115137	115147	115126	115126	Her	100	“ No idea . This is my worst nightmare . ”
115148	115157	115126	115126	Her	100	“ What do you have in your wardrobe ? ”
115158	115187	115126	115126	Her	100	“ Nothing . I have n’t bought an evening dress in years . What the hell do you even wear to a black - tie dinner these days ? ”
115188	115210	115126	115126	Her	100	“ We ’ll go shopping . Do n’t worry ; we ’ll find you something . You have to look amazing . ”
115211	115215	115126	115126	Her	100	“ I know . ”
115242	115265	115233	115233	I	3245	“ I want to look understated sexy , not like mutton dressed up as lamb . Something age appropriate but not motherly . ”
115266	115269	115270	115270	Marley	100	“ Definitely , ”
115276	115284	115270	115270	Marley	100	“ I ’m going to google this . ”
115285	115297	115233	115233	I	3245	“ Dress sense does n’t come up on Google , Marley . ”
115298	115305	115306	115306	She	1708	“ No , but stylists do . ”
115311	115319	115306	115306	She	1708	“ I ca n’t afford a stylist . ”
115320	115380	115381	115381	I	3245	“ What you ca n’t afford is to look like a bag of shit . This is his announcement to the world that you and he are together . It ’s an important event , and everyone is going to be looking at you . Do n’t worry ; we ’ll give her a strict budget to work with . ”
115391	115407	115381	115381	I	3245	“ Do you think ? Is n’t getting a stylist a bit over the top ? ”
115408	115445	115446	115446	I	3245	“ Claire , everyone in that ballroom is going to use a stylist , and besides , this is New York . Nothing is over the top . I got this . Leave it to me . ”
115588	115599	115600	115600	Harry	348	“ Oh my God , Mom . Look at this , ”
115628	115631	115632	115632	I	3245	“ Hello , ”
115635	115644	115645	115645	Harry	348	“ Mom , look what Tristan got us , ”
115658	115661	115648	115648	I	3245	“ What ? ”
115673	115679	115680	115680	He	1711	“ The rocket ship model . ”
115688	115692	115693	115693	Harry	348	“ The what ? ”
115701	115709	115710	115710	he	1711	“ Holy hell , look at this , ”
115739	115748	115758	115758	he	1711	“ Tris , that model is stupidly expensive . ”
115767	115770	115758	115758	he	1711	“ Anderson . ”
115791	115797	115798	115798	I	3245	“ What have you done ? ”
115801	115808	115809	115809	He	1711	“ I bought Wiz a present . ”
115813	115839	115840	115840	I	3245	“ He won the bet fair and square and then did n’t get to eat cockroaches . It was only right that I pay up . ”
115845	115865	115840	115840	I	3245	“ And it ’s for the other boys as well . We ’re all going to do it together . ”
115883	115918	115919	115919	Tristan	3029	“ Take it out of the box and lay it all out in the colored numbers . Keep the pieces in their individual bags , though . I ’m going to change my clothes , ”
115945	115950	115951	115951	Harry	348	“ Get the scissors , ”
116020	116032	116003	116003	He	3029	“ I ’m going to get the washing off the line , ”
116090	116093	116094	116094	he	3029	“ Anderson , ”
116106	116109	116110	116110	He	3029	“ Hi . ”
116136	116145	116146	116146	I	3245	“ You seem very pleased to see me . ”
116149	116152	116153	116153	he	3029	“ Needy , ”
116159	116164	116165	116165	I	3245	“ Needy for what ? ”
116173	116203	116168	116168	He	3029	“ I need to be fucked , Anderson . . . and as my designated fuckee , you need to find a way to make that happen . Tonight . ”
116259	116268	116269	116269	I	3245	“ How am I going to do that ? ”
116272	116281	116282	116282	He	3029	“ I do n’t know . Get creative . ”
116299	116310	116311	116311	He	3029	“ On the couch tonight — or in the laundry . ”
116316	116340	116311	116311	He	3029	“ Fuck me in my car out on the street , for all I care . I just need you to fuck me . ”
116341	116348	116349	116349	I	3245	“ Your car is too small , ”
116367	116374	116364	116364	I	3245	“ Do n’t dis the car . ”
116453	116461	116462	116462	he	3029	“ Or you could fuck me now , ”
116483	116487	116488	116488	I	3245	“ The children , ”
116491	116495	116496	116496	He	3029	“ Are distracted . ”
116574	116583	116584	116584	he	3029	“ So . . . you love me , ”
116632	116636	116637	116637	He	3029	“ I do . ”
116645	116653	116654	116654	he	3029	“ Fuck me like you hate me , ”
116763	116767	116768	116768	he	3029	“ Fuck me , ”
116771	116778	116768	116768	he	3029	“ Fuck me harder , Anderson . ”
116825	116830	116831	116831	I	3245	“ I hate you , ”
116848	116854	116855	116855	he	3029	“ I hate you too , ”
116865	116870	116855	116855	he	3029	“ Hate me harder . ”
116967	116988	116954	116954	he	3029	“ Did you buy my children a spaceship so that we ’d have time to sneak away and have sex ? ”
116989	116992	116993	116993	he	3029	“ Absolutely , ”
116996	117001	116993	116993	he	3029	“ One hundred percent . ”
117063	117066	117067	117067	I	3245	“ Genius . ”
117072	117083	117084	117084	He	3029	“ Now get out before they find you in here . ”
117125	117128	117119	117119	He	3029	“ What ? ”
117129	117149	117150	117150	He	3029	“ Too bad you have to go and build a rocket ship now . . . is n’t it ? ”
117159	117167	117150	117150	He	3029	“ Fuck . Do n’t remind me . ”
117202	117208	117193	117193	he	3029	“ It was worth it . ”
117212	117217	117218	117218	Tristan	3029	“ This is bullshit , ”
117221	117224	117225	117225	I	3245	“ Language , ”
117250	117260	117261	117261	Tristan	3029	“ What kind of imbecile packages things like this ? ”
117281	117289	117290	117290	Harrison	348	“ Not this way . That way , ”
117293	117303	117304	117304	I	3245	“ What are you going on about over there ? ”
117307	117316	117290	117290	Harrison	348	“ You have n’t even started it yet ? ”
117317	117325	117326	117326	Tristan	3029	“ There are one hundred and forty — ”
117329	117334	117335	117335	Harrison	348	“ Forty - five , ”
117338	117355	117335	117335	Harrison	348	“ One hundred and forty - five ziplock bags of parts in this box , Claire . ”
117395	117410	117381	117381	I	3245	“ If it ’s too hard for you . . . take it back . ”
117411	117414	117415	117416	the boys	2487	“ No ! ”
117422	117433	117434	117434	Tristan	3029	“ Oh . . . we ’re taking it back , ”
117440	117489	117490	117490	Patrick	372	“ We ’re taking it back completely built , and I ’m going to stick it in the old buzzard where the sun does n’t shine . I ’m putting an engine on this mofo , and we ’re going to fly it through his damn shop window . ”
117496	117503	117504	117504	He	372	“ What , in the nighttime ? ”
117513	117524	117525	117525	he	372	“ Yeah , Tricky , that ’s it . Nighttime , ”
117530	117540	117525	117525	he	372	“ Why do you dislike this shopkeeper so much ? ”
117549	117555	117556	117556	Tristan	3029	“ He was a jerkoff , ”
117559	117566	117567	117567	I	3245	“ Tristan . . . language , ”
117577	117599	117571	117571	He	372	“ Jerk off is n’t a swear word . It ’s a verb , Claire . . . a doing word . ”
117609	117625	117626	117626	Patrick	372	“ If you ca n’t say it in church , it is a swear word , ”
117629	117643	117644	117644	Tristan	3029	“ I ’m pretty sure that priests know the meaning of the word , ”
117648	117662	117663	117663	I	3245	“ Why did n’t you look at the instructions before you bought it ? ”
117666	117677	117678	117678	He	372	“ I would have , except these are n’t instructions . ”
117685	117706	117707	117707	He	372	“ These are directions on how to go insane . People have been institutionalized while reading this book , Claire . ”
117715	117731	117707	117707	He	372	“ Nobody can understand these instructions . The smartest man in the world could n’t . ”
117739	117751	117752	117752	I	3245	“ I thought you were the smartest man in the world , ”
117755	117763	117764	117764	he	372	“ Well , precisely . I am , ”
117767	117785	117764	117764	he	372	“ But how can I put something together when I ca n’t even understand the stupid instructions ? ”
117786	117791	117792	117792	Harrison	348	“ Give me that , ”
117818	117824	117825	117825	Tristan	3029	“ Watch out , Tricky . ”
117832	117843	117844	117844	He	3029	“ Hop up , buddy . I need a coffee . ”
117854	117864	117865	117865	I	3245	“ You do n’t want a glass of wine ? ”
117884	117906	117907	117907	I	3245	“ Do I appear to be relaxed to you , Claire ? Does this look like a relaxing moment in time ? ”
117953	117956	117957	117957	he	3029	“ What ? ”
117968	117980	117981	117981	I	3245	“ Maybe this model thing was n’t such a great idea ? ”
117984	117990	117991	117991	he	3029	“ We ’ll get it , ”
118002	118013	118014	118014	he	3029	“ If it ’s the last fucking thing I do , ”
118020	118026	118027	118027	I	3245	“ And it might be . ”
118047	118055	118056	118056	he	3029	“ Stop distracting the genius at work , ”
118168	118173	118174	118174	Harry	348	“ That ’s it ! ”
118177	118181	118174	118174	Harry	348	“ What is ? ”
118182	118213	118174	118174	Harry	348	“ The bags — they are the wrong colors compared to what ’s in the instructions . That ’s why nothing is adding up . It ’s all labeled wrong . ”
118214	118217	118218	118218	Fletcher	1305	“ What ? ”
118221	118265	118266	118266	Tristan	3029	“ The red parts are orange , and the orange parts are red . The black parts are white , and the white parts are gray . That ’s why we ca n’t find all the pieces . The colors are all wrong . ”
118271	118285	118266	118266	Tristan	3029	“ Why you . . . tick tock . . . old man . ”
118286	118289	118290	118290	Harrison	348	“ Yeah , ”
118293	118297	118290	118290	Harrison	348	“ Tick tock . ”
118298	118301	118302	118303	The stylist	1333	“ Hmm . ”
118317	118327	118328	118328	She	1333	“ We have a lot to work with here . ”
118374	118380	118362	118362	she	1333	“ You can do this . ”
118397	118440	118386	118386	I	3245	“ You ’re gorgeous , Claire ; there is no doubt about it . Your bone structure is flawless , and you have a beautiful figure . But you do n’t dress accordingly . Why do n’t you show it off more ? ”
118441	118444	118445	118445	I	3245	“ Oh . ”
118449	118458	118445	118445	I	3245	“ You need to wear more fitted things . ”
118459	118475	118476	118476	I	3245	“ I just do n’t want to look like I ’m trying to be young , ”
118480	118495	118476	118476	I	3245	“ You are young , Claire . You ’re only what ? Early thirties ? ”
118496	118503	118504	118504	She	1333	“ I ’m thirty - eight . ”
118520	118536	118507	118507	she	1333	“ I style eighty - year - olds . Trust me . You are young . ”
118548	118556	118540	118540	she	1333	“ Now , what do you need ? ”
118557	118569	118574	118574	She	1333	“ I have a black - tie dinner on Saturday night . ”
118570	118573	118574	118574	She	1333	“ Okay . ”
118584	118591	118592	118592	I	3245	“ At what time is it ? ”
118607	118610	118601	118601	Tristan	3029	“ Seven p.m. ”
118611	118614	118615	118615	She	1333	“ Okay . ”
118625	118630	118631	118631	She	1333	“ Hello , Marcello . ”
118637	118663	118631	118631	She	1333	“ Hello , darling . Listen , I have a favor . Can you do hair and makeup for me on Saturday night , please ? ”
118674	118697	118664	118664	I	3245	“ Oh . . . it ’s an emergency . I ’m going to send you images of exactly what we need . ”
118717	118726	118727	118727	She	1333	“ Yes , we have a Cinderella here . ”
118740	118751	118752	118752	She	1333	“ Okay great , I ’ll text you the address . ”
118756	118764	118765	118765	I	3245	“ Okay , that ’s sorted out . ”
118769	118787	118788	118788	I	3245	“ Marcello will come to your place and do your hair and makeup late on Saturday afternoon . ”
118804	118809	118797	118797	I	3245	“ Is that necessary ? ”
118810	118839	118797	118797	I	3245	“ Oh my God , darling . Yes . It ’s necessary . Now . . . let ’s go shopping . I know exactly what you need . ”
118840	118847	118848	118848	I	3245	“ Okay , thanks , Barb . ”
118956	118964	118965	118965	I	3245	“ Are you sure that ’s okay ? ”
119018	119037	119009	119009	Harry	348	“ Of course , Claire , he ’ll be fine . We will get pizza and watch movies . ”
119038	119049	119059	119059	she	73	“ Thanks so much . I ’ll see you then . ”
119050	119058	119059	119059	she	73	“ Okay , see you on Saturday , ”
119072	119076	119077	119077	he	3029	“ We good ? ”
119081	119085	119086	119086	I	3245	“ All good . ”
119089	119104	119105	119105	He	3029	“ Who knew that Tristan Miles would be excited about locking in a babysitter ? ”
119114	119117	119105	119105	He	3029	“ Right ? ”
119118	119139	119105	119105	He	3029	“ Seriously , though , it is a relief . Barb is the only one I would leave Harrison with . ”
119140	119159	119160	119160	I	3245	“ What ’s gone on with Harrison in the past to make you so nervous about leaving him ? ”
119167	119174	119160	119160	I	3245	“ He can be a nightmare . ”
119175	119201	119202	119202	I	3245	“ How ? I mean , I know he ’s a bit mischievous and all that , but is n’t that normal at his age ? ”
119210	119268	119202	119202	I	3245	“ Oh hell , where do I start ? He ’s been suspended from school . He disappears for hours at a time and then lies about where he ’s been , sneaks off to friends ’ houses without permission . He ’s fallen in with this party crowd but then denies he ’s been with them . ”
119269	119277	119278	119278	I	3245	“ Suspended from school — what for ? ”
119283	119332	119278	119278	I	3245	“ For some reason , he ’s under the impression that the teachers pick on him . One day he got a project back , and he thought he should have gotten a higher grade , and he got into a full - blown argument with his teacher . ”
119333	119342	119343	119343	Tris	3029	“ So . . . he was cheeky ? ”
119346	119349	119350	119350	I	3245	“ No . ”
119357	119372	119350	119350	I	3245	“ He opened the window and threw his assignment out of it in protest . ”
119378	119412	119413	119413	Tristan	3029	“ But that ’s not the worst of it . It accidently hit a janitor who was walking past and scratched his head . They thought he needed stitches . It was mortifying . ”
119426	119439	119440	119440	He	3029	“ It was so embarrassing — you have no idea , Tristan . ”
119451	119456	119445	119445	he	3029	“ I can imagine . ”
119468	119472	119457	119457	I	3245	“ Thank you . ”
119487	119491	119478	119478	his	3029	“ For what ? ”
119492	119504	119505	119505	I	3245	“ For making the trek out to see me every night . ”
119509	119517	119518	119518	He	3029	“ I know you hate the couch . ”
119523	119537	119518	119518	He	3029	“ Well . . . I hate being at home without you more . ”
119602	119621	119591	119591	Him	3029	“ You know , as I was walking in here today , a bowerbird swooped at my balls . ”
119629	119633	119622	119622	I	3245	“ A what ? ”
119634	119638	119648	119648	He	3029	“ A bowerbird . ”
119639	119644	119645	119645	I	3245	“ What ’s that ? ”
119657	119673	119648	119648	He	3029	“ Everyone knows what a bowerbird is , Claire . I suggest you google it . ”
119688	119697	119698	119698	He	3029	“ A bowerbird collects blue things , Claire . ”
119727	119730	119724	119724	I	3245	“ Whatever . ”
119731	119734	119715	119715	he	3029	“ Tristan , ”
119750	119756	119757	119757	he	3029	“ Did you hear that ? ”
119760	119763	119764	119764	I	3245	“ What ? ”
119786	119789	119816	119816	He	3029	“ Tristan . ”
119790	119803	119816	119816	He	3029	“ That ’s the first time he ’s ever said my name . ”
119804	119812	119813	119813	I	3245	“ Harry ’s never said your name ? ”
119825	119828	119829	119829	Harry	348	“ Tristan , ”
119836	119845	119832	119832	Tristan	3029	“ Yes , Wiz , what is it ? ”
119846	119857	119858	119858	He	3029	“ Can you help us for a minute , please ? ”
119868	119871	119872	119872	He	3029	“ Coming . ”
119959	119964	119965	119965	Tristan	3029	“ Let him in , ”
119987	119996	119997	119997	he	3029	“ Your hairdresser is here , Ms. Anderson , ”
120000	120004	119997	119997	he	3029	“ Oh God . ”
120015	120021	120005	120005	I	3245	“ This seems . . . ”
120022	120025	120026	120026	He	3029	“ Normal . ”
120041	120057	120031	120031	he	3029	“ I ’m going to go out for a while and leave you to it . ”
120058	120064	120065	120065	I	3245	“ Where are you going ? ”
120078	120108	120031	120031	he	3029	“ I ’m meeting Elliot and Christopher at a bar to watch the game . I ’ll be back around six . We leave around six forty - five . ”
120132	120135	120136	120136	I	3245	“ Okay . ”
120156	120166	120151	120151	I	3245	“ Do you need anything while I ’m out ? ”
120167	120175	120183	120183	He	3029	“ Just for you to come home . ”
120192	120195	120183	120183	He	3029	“ Goodbye . ”
120276	120279	120280	120280	He	3029	“ Hello . ”
120291	120295	120280	120280	He	3029	“ Tristan Miles . ”
120296	120303	120304	120305	the man	622	“ Hi , I ’m Marcello , ”
120317	120325	120312	120312	he	622	“ I ’m here to style Claire . ”
120326	120333	120334	120334	I	3245	“ Hello , that ’s me . ”
120352	120365	120366	120366	Tristan	3029	“ Oh . . . this is going to be so fun . ”
120376	120396	120397	120397	he	3029	“ No . . . this is going to be completely funless for you . . . or else , ”
120404	120419	120420	120420	Tristan	3029	“ Oh . . . so possessive of his woman . I love that . ”
120440	120453	120429	120429	Marcello	230	“ Goodbye . She will be beautiful for you when you return . ”
120454	120459	120460	120460	Tristan	3029	“ She already is , ”
120465	120480	120481	120481	He	3029	“ And I ’m not going anywhere . I ’ll be right out here . ”
120503	120507	120499	120499	I	3245	“ Through here . ”
120550	120555	120537	120537	He	3029	“ Let us begin . ”
120881	120884	120885	120885	he	3029	“ Claire , ”
121041	121044	121045	121045	he	3029	“ Fuck , ”
121094	121102	121103	121103	he	3029	“ You look fucking edible , Anderson , ”
121161	121168	121169	121169	he	3029	“ Are you wet for me ? ”
121216	121222	121223	121223	I	3245	“ We need to go , ”
121237	121240	121241	121241	He	3029	“ No . ”
121246	121252	121241	121241	He	3029	“ You need to come . ”
121353	121360	121361	121361	he	3029	“ I love you , Claire , ”

121870	121891	121892	121892	He	3029	“ I am a fucking rock star , Anderson . When will you get with the program and realize it ? ”
121926	121930	121914	121914	He	3029	“ Over here . ”

122476	122489	122473	122473	Christopher	130	“ I hope they ’re giving him a run for his money . ”
122490	122499	122500	122500	George	233	“ It would be payback if they did , ”
122504	122513	122514	122515	The group	558	“ He was a coot of a kid . ”
122527	122538	122539	122539	Tristan	3029	“ Do you want to go and get a drink ? ”
122543	122548	122549	122549	I	3245	“ Yes , please , ”

122824	122841	122821	122821	She	234	“ Still in the honeymoon phase . Tristan told me that you live on Long Island ? ”
122842	122859	122748	122748	She	234	“ Yes , it ’s a ways out of New York but great for the boys . ”
122860	122871	122821	122821	She	234	“ Oh , well , we live in New Jersey . ”
122872	122875	122876	122876	I	3245	“ Really ? ”
122881	122911	122876	122876	I	3245	“ We stay in New York maybe two nights a week at most . I wanted to get Jay out of the city and into a more relaxed lifestyle . ”
122912	122917	122918	122918	I	3245	“ He ’s stressed ? ”
122921	122924	122925	122925	She	234	“ God . ”
122930	122957	122925	122925	She	234	“ Massively . His workload is ridiculous . He ’s a lot better since we got married , and he works from home on Fridays now . ”
123028	123034	123035	123035	I	3245	“ Are you all right ? ”
123038	123041	123035	123035	I	3245	“ Thanks . ”
123042	123056	123057	123057	I	3245	“ Well , there ’s an ugly face if I ever saw one , ”
123093	123096	123097	123097	Tristan	3029	“ Hey . ”
123131	123162	123127	123127	Tristan	3029	“ Claire , please meet Spencer Jones and Sebastian Garcia , my friends from London . And you both know Emily . Jameson and Sebastian met in Italy at college . ”
123163	123176	123177	123177	Sebastian	237	“ I ’ve been trying to get rid of them ever since . ”
123199	123207	123208	123208	she	234	“ How are my favorite London villains ? ”
123220	123224	123225	123225	Spencer	236	“ Very well , ”
123246	123252	123238	123238	He	236	“ Where have you been ? ”
123253	123259	123260	123260	Tristan	3029	“ I ’ve been here , ”
123271	123275	123263	123263	He	236	“ With Claire . ”
123295	123303	123285	123285	he	236	“ Did you two meet in France ? ”
123304	123309	123310	123310	Tristan	3029	“ This is her . ”
123369	123375	123376	123376	Tristan	3029	“ Back in a minute , ”
123402	123407	123408	123408	I	3245	“ Who are they ? ”
123411	123422	123423	123423	Emily	234	“ They are the naughtiest men in all of England , ”
123426	123432	123423	123423	Emily	234	“ And the most gorgeous . ”
123433	123436	123437	123437	I	3245	“ God , ”
123463	123469	123456	123458	All of them	1799	“ You ’re not wrong . ”
123470	123480	123423	123423	Emily	234	“ Spencer Jones is the world ’s biggest player . ”
123481	123487	123488	123488	I	3245	“ He ’s the blond ? ”
123491	123504	123488	123488	I	3245	“ That ’s him . Ridiculously good looking , is n’t he ? ”
123505	123519	123520	123520	I	3245	“ The other one is more gorgeous . What ’s his name again ? ”
123523	123534	123520	123520	I	3245	“ Sebastian Garcia . His marriage just broke up recently . ”
123535	123544	123545	123545	I	3245	“ Really ? He ’s a player too ? ”
123548	123558	123545	123545	I	3245	“ No , his wife slept with their gardener . ”
123559	123562	123563	123563	I	3245	“ What ? ”

128273	128310	128257	128257	I	3245	“ Because he ’s lying , and I wo n’t tolerate it . I ’m not taking his crap anymore , Tristan . I ’m done with it . There is no excuse for his behavior . ”
128311	128318	128319	128319	I	3245	“ Leave it on the table , ”

130541	130544	130536	130536	she	243	“ Boom . ”

130562	130566	130567	130567	I	3245	“ Not funny ! ”
130588	130596	130597	130597	He	73	“ What the fuck are you doing ? ”
130600	130606	130597	130597	He	73	“ Give me your clothes . ”

130747	130762	130738	130738	Jameson	73	“ I thought Elliot and Christopher were coming in today . Take their suits . ”
130763	130779	130738	130738	Jameson	73	“ They wo n’t be here until after ten . They have a breakfast meeting . ”

130796	130802	130803	130803	She	1936	“ Do I have to ? ”
130844	130869	130835	130835	Sammia	144	“ Do n’t mind us ; this is the most exciting thing that ’s happened in the office for like . . . forever . ”
130897	130901	130902	130902	I	3245	“ Fucking perverts , ”
130905	130913	130902	130902	I	3245	“ Go watch some porn or something . ”
130914	130919	130920	130920	Sammia	144	“ This is better . ”
130924	130928	130929	130929	Jameson	73	“ Jesus Christ , ”

131077	131080	131081	131081	I	3245	“ Goodbye , ”
131090	131102	131081	131081	I	3245	“ This is not the morning I had in fucking mind . ”
131103	131107	131108	131109	the girls	383	“ Good luck ! ”
131113	131127	131108	131109	the girls	383	“ I hope you do n’t run into any more cats out there . ”

131142	131149	131133	131133	I	3245	“ This is n’t fucking funny . ”
131165	131173	131157	131157	Sammia	144	“ Tris , your mom is here . ”
131185	131190	131174	131174	I	3245	“ Send her in . ”
131219	131224	131208	131208	Her	144	“ Hello , Mom . ”
131225	131230	131231	131231	She	144	“ Hello , darling . ”
131253	131267	131239	131239	She	144	“ Mallory , can you bring my mother in some tea , please ? ”
131268	131272	131273	131273	She	144	“ Of course . ”
131280	131283	131284	131284	I	3245	“ Yes ? ”
131287	131292	131284	131284	I	3245	“ Claire ’s lovely . ”
131293	131297	131298	131298	I	3245	“ She is . ”
131318	131324	131325	131325	I	3245	“ But . . . ? ”
131331	131350	131328	131328	She	144	“ Come on , Mother , you have come here for a reason today . What is it ? ”
131351	131356	131357	131357	She	144	“ Tristan . . . ”
131360	131369	131357	131357	She	144	“ Why do you think you like Claire ? ”
131370	131383	131384	131384	She	144	“ I do n’t like her , Mom . I love her . ”
131388	131391	131392	131392	She	144	“ Tris . ”
131406	131423	131424	131424	I	3245	“ Ever since you were a child , you have had a very strong personality trait . ”
131430	131443	131444	131444	I	3245	“ And so far in business , it has served you well . ”
131448	131470	131444	131444	I	3245	“ But now I feel I must make you aware of it , because I fear it is affecting you personally . ”
131471	131480	131481	131481	I	3245	“ What are you talking about , Mom ? ”
131491	131500	131486	131486	She	144	“ Tristan , you like to fix things . ”
131507	131558	131559	131559	I	3245	“ You do n’t destroy companies ; you buy them to fix them . It is your natural ability to sense when something needs you . You have always been like this , even when you were a tiny little boy . You are attracted to people who need help . ”
131564	131585	131559	131559	I	3245	“ Think about it . The staff that you yourself hire always have an issue that they need to overcome . ”
131593	131604	131559	131559	I	3245	“ The companies that you want always are in trouble . ”
131605	131613	131559	131559	I	3245	“ That ’s my job , Mom . ”
131614	131652	131559	131559	I	3245	“ No , Tristan , nobody ever told you that you need to buy companies in trouble . You took that on yourself . Are you in love with Claire because she needs you to fix her ? ”
131653	131656	131657	131657	I	3245	“ No , ”
131662	131691	131657	131657	I	3245	“ Her sons , do they have problems ? Because I can guarantee the bigger the problems they have , the more you will be attracted to them . ”
131701	131717	131692	131692	I	3245	“ Every girlfriend you have ever had has needed fixing . . . except Mary . ”
131744	131776	131777	131777	I	3245	“ You loved Mary , Tristan . With all your heart you loved her . But she did n’t need fixing , so you felt that you had to leave her . ”
131810	131833	131834	131834	Mom	1407	“ Why do you think you were so heartbroken breaking up with her ? And yet you could n’t take her back , ”
131837	131841	131834	131834	Mom	1407	“ Could you ? ”
131847	131887	131834	131834	Mom	1407	“ You are about to perhaps give up the chance to have your own children for a woman you think you need to fix . Those boys will never be yours , Tristan . They are hers and his . ”
131898	131905	131834	131834	Mom	1407	“ I love Claire , Mom . ”
131906	131921	131922	131922	She	1948	“ I know you do , darling . There ’s a lot to love . ”
131933	131953	131922	131922	She	1948	“ But before you go any further with her and her children , I need you to do something . ”
131954	131957	131834	131834	Mom	1407	“ What ? ”
131958	131990	131922	131922	She	1948	“ You do this for me , and I will never ever bring this up again , and I ’ll embrace Claire and her boys as if they are my own . ”
131991	131997	131922	131922	She	1948	“ What do you want ? ”
131998	132008	132009	132009	I	3245	“ I want you to go and see Mary . ”
132030	132066	132023	132023	me	3245	“ After seeing her , if you can honestly tell me that you do n’t have any feelings for Mary and what I am saying is n’t right , you have my blessing with Claire . ”
132067	132077	132078	132078	I	3245	“ Mary ’s probably married by now , Mom . ”
132081	132098	132078	132078	I	3245	“ She ’s still in love with you , Tristan . She never got over you . ”
132109	132116	132104	132104	I	3245	“ I speak to her often . ”
132128	132136	132137	132137	Claire	372	“ She ’s expecting your call today . ”
132333	132341	132317	132317	He	1305	“ How was Tristan at work today ? ”
132356	132363	132364	132364	He	1305	“ Is something wrong , Fletch ? ”
132377	132386	132387	132387	he	1305	“ Where did Tristan say he was tonight ? ”
132395	132400	132401	132401	My	3245	“ Something came up . ”
132406	132415	132416	132416	He	1305	“ Do you know where he is tonight ? ”
132424	132445	132446	132446	He	1305	“ You can tell me , baby . Nothing bad is going to happen . Tristan and I are adults . ”
132456	132464	132465	132465	I	3245	“ His mother came to see him . ”
132468	132481	132465	132465	I	3245	“ I should n’t have , but I listened at the door . ”
132482	132485	132420	132420	he	1305	“ Why ? ”
132486	132513	132514	132514	My	3245	“ Because last time she was there , I heard her warning Tristan that he would n’t have his own children if he stayed with you . ”
132518	132526	132514	132514	My	3245	“ What did Tristan say to that ? ”
132527	132539	132540	132540	I	3245	“ He said he knew , but he wanted you more . ”
132560	132567	132550	132550	he	3245	“ What did she say today ? ”
132568	132581	132582	132582	I	3245	“ She said that Tristan only wants things that he can fix . ”
132585	132606	132607	132607	He	3245	“ She said that it ’s part of his personality , that he ’s drawn to people who need him . ”
132629	132635	132615	132615	He	3245	“ Go on , baby . ”
132639	132644	132636	132636	I	3245	“ It ’s okay . ”
132645	132676	132677	132677	My	3245	“ She said that she thinks Tristan is still in love with his ex - girlfriend and that he only left her because she did n’t need to be fixed . ”
132699	132722	132692	132692	He	1514	“ She thinks that Tristan is only with you because we are all so damaged , and he wants to help us . ”
132756	132761	132762	132762	I	3245	“ Where is he ? ”
132765	132782	132762	132762	I	3245	“ He went to see Mary . He went to see if he still loves her . ”
133105	133110	133092	133092	I	3245	“ Hi , Tris . ”
133115	133120	133121	133121	I	3245	“ It ’s me . ”

133149	133163	133164	133164	I	3245	“ I just want you to know that I understand and . . . ”
133169	133177	133178	133178	I	3245	“ And . . . thank you . ”
133184	133209	133178	133178	I	3245	“ Thank you for trying with us . I appreciate it more than you know . . . but I ’m letting you go . ”
133221	133235	133215	133215	they	1966	“ I want you to be with her . Your mother is right . ”
133240	133249	133236	133236	I	3245	“ She ’s the one you really love . ”
133250	133257	133263	133263	me	3245	“ No , she ’s not . ”
133287	133299	133300	133300	He	3029	“ What fucking bullshit are you going on with , woman ? ”
133303	133310	133311	133311	I	3245	“ What are you doing here ? ”
133331	133345	133317	133317	He	3029	“ I ’m coming home to sleep — what does it look like ? ”
133346	133353	133354	133354	He	3029	“ But . . . Mary ? ”
133368	133374	133375	133375	I	3245	“ Mary . . . , ”
133378	133406	133375	133375	I	3245	“ Was like seeing a sister . Nothing there at all . Just like I knew it would be . I went there to mollify my mother . ”
133407	133410	133417	133417	He	3029	“ What ? ”
133411	133416	133417	133417	He	3029	“ I love you . ”
133422	133451	133452	133452	He	3029	“ And to be honest , I ’m glad I went , because it proved something to me . . . my mother ’s got it all wrong . ”
133469	133487	133461	133461	I	3245	“ You and the boys . . . are saving me . Not the other way around . ”
133502	133507	133508	133508	he	3029	“ I love you , ”
133511	133534	133535	133535	Hope	206	“ I do n’t want to be anywhere else . In fact I ’ve decided that I want to move in here . ”
133541	133545	133535	133535	Hope	206	“ You do ? ”
133546	133566	133567	133567	He	3029	“ I have some of my stuff in the car . I was actually at home packing a suitcase . ”
133585	133591	133592	133592	I	3245	“ What is that car ? ”
133599	133607	133595	133595	He	3029	“ I got us a new car . ”
133620	133634	133635	133635	I	3245	“ Are you sure about this . . . about us , Tris ? ”
133638	133641	133642	133642	He	3029	“ Claire . ”
133657	133676	133648	133648	he	3029	“ I love you more than anything . This . . . is where I want to be . ”
133682	133695	133696	133696	he	3029	“ And I ’m going to kill Fletcher for listening through doors , ”
133704	133726	133727	133727	I	3245	“ And the Muff Cat is going fucking down . I ’m going inside to piss in its bed right now . ”
133739	133752	133753	133753	he	3029	“ And how dare you think I was in love with Mary ? ”
133756	133767	133768	133768	He	3029	“ I ’m fucking your ass for that , Anderson . ”
133832	133837	133838	133838	I	3245	“ So . . . ”
133849	133858	133838	133838	I	3245	“ I wanted to talk to you boys . ”
133879	133882	133871	133871	He	3029	“ Yeah . ”
133890	133900	133883	133883	They	2730	“ I was wondering if Tristan could move in . ”
133910	133918	133919	133919	I	3245	“ It would mean that . . . ”
133925	133964	133919	133919	I	3245	“ It would mean that he would live here with us . . . and that he does n’t have to sleep on the couch anymore — that ’s all . It ’s beginning to hurt his back . ”
133965	133968	133969	133969	Patrick	372	“ Okay , ”
133982	133996	133997	133997	Tristan	3029	“ And of course , he would become part of our family now . ”
134012	134021	134022	134022	Tristan	3029	“ Do you want to move in here ? ”
134025	134028	134029	134029	Harry	348	“ Yes . ”
134035	134041	134042	134042	I	3245	“ What does that mean ? ”
134046	134053	134054	134054	I	3245	“ Yeah . . . okay . ”
134057	134061	134054	134054	I	3245	“ Okay what ? ”
134062	134067	134068	134068	Tristan	3029	“ If he must . ”
134090	134097	134098	134098	He	348	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
134111	134114	134115	134115	Tristan	3029	“ Okay , ”
134118	134128	134129	134129	He	348	“ Come on . We need to leave soon . ”
134134	134148	134129	134129	He	348	“ You get your grade back today , do n’t you , Wiz ? ”
134149	134152	134153	134153	Harry	348	“ Yeah . ”
134156	134166	134153	134153	Harry	348	“ I wo n’t pass . I never do . ”
134167	134177	134178	134178	Tristan	3029	“ I predict you ’re getting a one hundred , ”
134184	134196	134197	134197	Fletcher	1305	“ That assignment was on point . I checked it myself . ”
134214	134223	134224	134224	I	3245	“ Oh my God , Fletcher said no , ”
134227	134251	134252	134252	He	348	“ It will be fine . I ’ll talk to him today . He ’s angry at me ; he ’ll be fine . ”
134258	134263	134252	134252	He	348	“ I love you . ”
134272	134278	134264	134264	I	3245	“ I love you too . ”
134279	134282	134283	134283	Tristan	3029	“ What ? ”
134293	134296	134297	134297	he	348	“ Thirty ! ”
134300	134310	134311	134311	he	348	“ A fucking thirty ? Are you kidding me ? ”
134322	134327	134328	134328	I	3245	“ Tristan , language , ”
134366	134379	134380	134380	he	348	“ There is no way in hell this assignment is a thirty ! ”
134388	134405	134406	134406	he	348	“ What are these idiotic , stupid . . . incompetent assholes doing at this school ? ”
134409	134415	134416	134416	Harry	348	“ Mrs. Henderson hates me . ”
134419	134425	134426	134426	I	3245	“ Will you calm down ? ”
134431	134435	134426	134426	I	3245	“ Stop swearing . ”
134436	134443	134444	134444	he	348	“ No . I will not , ”
134447	134465	134466	134466	He	348	“ That ’s it — tomorrow morning , nine a.m. , I am at that fucking school . ”
134471	134483	134484	134484	I	3245	“ Tick . . . tock . . . Mrs. Henderson . ”
134489	134499	134484	134484	I	3245	“ Good grief , this is all I need . ”
134529	134537	134538	134538	Patrick	372	“ What is he doing out there ? ”
134761	134766	134767	134767	he	348	“ Are you ready ? ”
134770	134773	134774	134774	I	3245	“ Tristan . ”
134785	134788	134779	134779	He	348	“ What ? ”
134789	134805	134806	134806	He	348	“ You ’re not going to be passive aggressive to Mrs. Henderson , are you ? ”
134811	134814	134815	134815	He	348	“ Nope . ”
134833	134842	134843	134843	I	3245	“ I ’m going to be aggressive aggressive . ”
134848	134853	134843	134843	I	3245	“ Can you not ? ”
134854	134857	134858	134858	He	348	“ Claire . ”
134866	134902	134858	134858	He	348	“ I will not for one fucking minute have him treated in this manner , and if you are asking me to bite my tongue . . . it ’s best you do n’t come . ”
134903	134907	134908	134908	I	3245	“ Christ Almighty , ”
134914	134923	134924	134924	I	3245	“ Can you just be calm , please ? ”
134927	134934	134924	134924	I	3245	“ You ’re stressing me out . ”
134935	134942	134943	134943	He	348	“ I ’m stressing you out ? ”
134950	134982	134943	134943	He	348	“ Do n’t come , Claire . Sit in the car . Because I am telling you right now : I ’m not about to take shit from this fucking teacher . ”
135152	135167	135144	135144	He	348	“ Harrison , you will be coming to the meeting with us , please . ”
135175	135178	135168	135168	Harry	348	“ But — ”
135179	135192	135196	135196	I	3245	“ No buts . You need to learn how to defend yourself . ”
135302	135308	135309	135309	she	1998	“ Can I help you ? ”
135313	135349	135350	135350	Her	1998	“ Hello , I ’m Tristan Miles . I would like a meeting with Mrs. Henderson , the principal , the vice - principal , and someone from the parent - teacher association , please . ”
135365	135369	135357	135357	I	3245	“ When for ? ”
135370	135373	135374	135374	He	3245	“ Now . ”
135391	135399	135400	135400	she	1998	“ What is this in regard to ? ”
135403	135407	135400	135400	she	1998	“ Harrison Anderson . ”
135408	135411	135412	135412	Tristan	3029	“ About ? ”
135417	135437	135438	135438	Harrison	348	“ Can you please just do your allocated job and book the appointment ? This is a private matter . ”
135483	135503	135471	135471	She	1998	“ That wo n’t be possible . You need to book a meeting at least two weeks in advance . ”
135504	135508	135509	135509	Tristan	3029	“ All right . ”
135514	135532	135533	135533	Her	1998	“ I would like you to get the board of education on the phone for me immediately . ”
135537	135541	135533	135533	Her	1998	“ What for ? ”
135542	135575	135576	135576	She	1998	“ I would like to make a formal complaint to them . It is your duty to contact them on my behalf in the instance of a crisis , is it not ? ”
135624	135630	135631	135631	she	1998	“ What are you doing ? ”
135634	135651	135652	135652	He	348	“ I ’m not leaving until I have that meeting or speak to the education board . ”
135656	135662	135663	135663	He	348	“ The choice is yours . ”
135675	135680	135681	135681	she	1998	“ Just a minute , ”
135733	135764	135727	135727	She	1998	“ Mrs. Smithers , the principal , has had an opening . She can see you now . Mrs. Henderson is in class , so she wo n’t be attending . ”
135765	135779	135780	135780	he	348	“ Make that call . The meeting does n’t go ahead without her , ”
135812	135818	135805	135805	He	348	“ do n’t fuck with me ”
135821	135826	135827	135827	She	1998	“ Just a minute . ”
135836	135842	135843	135843	Tristan	3029	“ No talking in here , ”
135851	135854	135855	135855	She	1998	“ Okay . ”
135861	135867	135868	135868	She	1998	“ This way , please . ”
135888	135891	135892	135892	He	348	“ Hello . ”
135896	135920	135921	135921	He	348	“ My name is Tristan Miles , and this is Claire Anderson , my partner , and I ’m sure you know Harrison . ”
135933	135940	135941	135941	Tristan	3029	“ Take a seat , please . ”
135948	135960	135941	135941	Tristan	3029	“ You will need to stay and take minutes , please . ”
135966	135969	135961	135961	Her	2011	“ What ? ”
135970	135982	135983	135983	he	348	“ I want this meeting documented . Who will take notes , ”
135991	135996	135986	135986	he	348	“ if not you ? ”
136017	136030	136031	136031	She	248	“ Yes , okay . Sheridan , take the minutes , please . ”
136048	136053	136054	136054	She	248	“ I ’m here . ”
136075	136085	136065	136066	Mrs. Smithers	248	“ How can I help you , Mr. Miles ? ”
136086	136108	136109	136109	He	348	“ I would like to discuss the education of Harrison and , in particular , the grading system of his work . ”
136121	136135	136109	136109	He	348	“ He got a thirty on this . Please explain to me why . ”
136140	136147	136148	136148	Tristan	3029	“ It was n’t any good . ”
136155	136160	136148	136148	Tristan	3029	“ In whose opinion ? ”
136161	136174	136175	136175	Tristan	3029	“ Mine , and as his teacher , what I say goes . ”
136193	136198	136199	136199	He	3029	“ Is that so ? ”
136202	136211	136199	136199	He	3029	“ I would like this assignment independently graded . ”
136212	136229	136148	136148	Tristan	3029	“ No , that ’s not possible , and why would you want to do that ? ”
136230	136248	136199	136199	He	3029	“ Because Harrison Anderson is being victimized by you because you have a personality clash with him . ”
136249	136253	136254	136255	Mrs. Henderson	246	“ Oh please , ”
136258	136273	136274	136275	The principal	1998	“ I try and teach him , but there is nothing in his head . ”
136285	136291	136292	136292	He	1998	“ And there it is . ”
136298	136304	136292	136292	He	1998	“ Did you get that ? ”
136310	136322	136323	136323	He	1998	“ You ’ve just signed your termination letter , Mrs. Henderson . ”
136332	136366	136327	136327	She	1998	“ I ’ve personally checked this assignment , and it is not a thirty — perhaps an eighty at worst . You grade him low on every test on some personal power trip . ”
136367	136374	136375	136375	she	1998	“ Oh , that is rubbish , ”
136387	136407	136378	136378	Tristan	3029	“ I have every single test of Harrison ’s right here , and I would like an independent grader . ”
136408	136419	136327	136327	She	1998	“ He ’s rude , and he needs to repeat . ”
136420	136445	136378	136378	Tristan	3029	“ He ’s gifted and tired of being discriminated against . Tell me , Mrs. Henderson , have you ever had his IQ tested ? ”
136446	136453	136378	136378	Tristan	3029	“ No . . . but — ”
136454	136491	136327	136327	She	1998	“ Do you think it ’s possible that you are intimidated by this child , and you purposely try and get him sent out of class so that he does n’t activate your own inferiority complex ? ”
136492	136499	136500	136501	Mrs. Smithers	248	“ Oh , that ’s ridiculous , ”
136504	136513	136514	136514	Tristan	3029	“ You are very rude , Mr. Miles . ”
136521	136544	136545	136545	Her	248	“ On another topic , Mrs. Smithers , I would like a report on what you are doing to help Patrick Anderson . ”
136549	136553	136545	136545	Her	248	“ For what ? ”
136554	136578	136581	136581	he	3029	“ He has dyslexia , and under state law your school receives special funding for extra help for him . Where is it ? ”
136585	136600	136581	136581	he	3029	“ I do n’t appreciate you coming in here and slinging your accusations around , ”
136610	136618	136619	136619	He	3029	“ And I do n’t appreciate incompetence . ”
136622	136637	136638	136638	He	3029	“ You will be hearing from the education board with regard to this matter . ”
136644	136658	136638	136638	He	3029	“ Harrison wo n’t be back . Nor Patrick , for that matter . ”
136667	136677	136678	136679	Mrs. Henderson	246	“ And where are you going to send him ? ”
136683	136691	136678	136679	Mrs. Henderson	246	“ They ’ll be attending Trinity School . ”
136692	136695	136696	136697	Mrs. Smithers	248	“ Ha , ”
136700	136718	136696	136697	Mrs. Smithers	248	“ He wo n’t get in there . They wo n’t take him with his behavior record . ”
136719	136724	136725	136725	He	3029	“ We ’ll see . ”
136738	136748	136749	136749	He	3029	“ You know , intelligent people scare stupid people . ”

136846	136859	136860	136860	Tristan	3029	“ Do you want to go and say goodbye to your friends ? ”
136864	136876	136877	136877	Tristan	3029	“ Nah , my friends do n’t even go here anymore . ”
136883	136898	136877	136877	Tristan	3029	“ Who do you hang around with now ? Where are your friends from ? ”
136899	136906	136938	136938	God	78	“ Sports and the skate park . ”
136907	136917	136877	136877	Tristan	3029	“ So . . . what about at school ? ”

136962	136974	136975	136975	He	3029	“ Good riddance , Mrs. Henderson , you stupid old bag . ”
137018	137024	137025	137025	he	3029	“ You need to hurry ! ”

138264	138274	138275	138275	He	51	“ Because I want to buy it for us . ”
138290	138293	138294	138294	I	3245	“ What ? ”
138334	138344	138345	138345	he	51	“ Michael , this is Claire , my partner , ”

138691	138697	138687	138687	Tristan	3029	“ Pretty sweet , right ? ”
138698	138701	138702	138702	I	3245	“ Hmm , ”
138709	138716	138705	138705	I	3245	“ Out here is the kitchen . ”
138733	138743	138744	138744	he	3029	“ Wiz and I could cook up a storm , ”
138832	138839	138840	138840	he	348	“ This is the living area , ”
138851	138861	138862	138862	Patrick	372	“ Oh my God , look at the pool , ”
138865	138874	138875	138875	Fletcher	1305	“ It has a pool bar , Mom , ”

138891	138895	138896	138896	Tristan	3029	“ And look , ”
138907	138914	138899	138899	he	372	“ This could be your office . ”
138935	138946	138947	138947	He	372	“ And this could be my office , next door . ”
138954	138973	138947	138947	He	372	“ There ’s a bathroom down here . A second living area for the boys . A gymnasium . ”

139078	139089	139072	139072	I	3245	“ Look at the size of your closet , babe . ”
139097	139106	139107	139107	I	3245	“ It ’s not my closet , Tristan , ”
139117	139127	139110	139110	He	372	“ But you like it . . . right ? ”
139161	139168	139169	139169	Harry	348	“ I ’m having this room , ”
139172	139178	139179	139179	Patrick	372	“ I want this one ! ”

139205	139209	139210	139210	I	3245	“ About what ? ”

139229	139235	139192	139192	Tristan	3029	“ An offer for what ? ”
139236	139249	139250	139250	I	3245	“ To buy it for us to live in — what else ? ”
139259	139268	139250	139250	I	3245	“ I do n’t want to live here . ”
139269	139273	139274	139274	His	3029	“ Why not ? ”
139278	139310	139311	139311	He	3029	“ It ’s close to the boys ’ new school . You , Fletch , and I all work in New York . There ’s a yard for Muff and Woofy . ”
139322	139329	139311	139311	He	3029	“ It ’s perfect for us . ”
139330	139338	139339	139339	I	3245	“ I ’m not moving , Tristan , ”
139342	139354	139359	139359	he	3029	“ I want to live in the house we are in . ”
139355	139358	139359	139359	he	3029	“ Claire , ”
139420	139426	139427	139427	I	3245	“ I ’m not moving , ”
139430	139435	139427	139427	I	3245	“ End of story . ”
139450	139455	139456	139456	Michael	168	“ How was it ? ”
139466	139469	139470	139470	I	3245	“ Lovely , ”
139473	139481	139482	139482	He	168	“ Can you see yourself living here ? ”
139497	139506	139485	139485	I	3245	“ No . I ca n’t , actually . ”
139578	139581	139582	139582	I	3245	“ What ? ”
139585	139592	139593	139593	he	168	“ Do n’t give me what , ”
139603	139612	139593	139593	he	168	“ You did n’t even look at it . ”
139613	139631	139596	139596	he	168	“ I do n’t have to . I ’m not moving from my home in Long Island . ”
139632	139640	139641	139641	He	168	“ It ’s too small for us . ”
139660	139674	139675	139675	he	168	“ I want my boys to have room to have their friends over , ”
139703	139710	139711	139711	I	3245	“ They are Wade ’s boys , ”
139714	139724	139711	139711	I	3245	“ You need to stop calling them your boys . ”
139738	139748	139731	139731	He	168	“ What the fuck is that supposed to mean ? ”
139766	139781	139731	139731	He	168	“ You do know , Claire . . . that when we get married — ”
139782	139788	139789	139789	I	3245	“ If we get married , ”
139792	139800	139789	139789	I	3245	“ I will be adopting the boys . ”
139801	139804	139805	139805	I	3245	“ What ? ”
139831	139839	139825	139825	He	168	“ That ’s not happening , Tristan . ”
139840	139843	139844	139844	he	168	“ What ? ”
139847	139854	139855	139855	I	3245	“ They already have a father , ”
139858	139872	139855	139855	I	3245	“ I want them as my sons in the eyes of the law . ”
139873	139895	139855	139855	I	3245	“ Well , you ca n’t fucking have them legally . You get to live with them — that ’s enough . ”
139896	139899	139900	139900	Fletcher	1305	“ Mom ! ”
139906	139910	139911	139911	Tristan	3029	“ Stop it . ”
139928	139955	139919	139919	His	3029	“ So you ’re telling me I can care for them , I can love them , but I ca n’t ever call them my sons . ”
139956	139962	139963	139963	I	3245	“ They have a father , ”
139966	139976	139963	139963	I	3245	“ And they will remember and respect his wishes . ”
139977	139985	139986	139986	he	3029	“ He ’s fucking dead , Claire , ”
139989	140010	139986	139986	he	3029	“ And I wo n’t be punished because he ’s gone . I want them legally to be my sons . ”
140019	140026	140027	140027	I	3245	“ It ’s never fucking happening , ”
140030	140068	140069	140069	He	2095	“ They are my and Wade ’s sons . Not yours . They will never be yours . I told you to find someone else and have your own children — you ca n’t have Wade ’s . ”
140089	140095	140084	140084	Patrick	372	“ You ’re scaring him . ”
140160	140167	140168	140168	Harry	348	“ Are you coming , Tris ? ”
140171	140176	140177	140177	Tristan	3029	“ No , buddy , ”
140185	140192	140177	140177	Tristan	3029	“ I ’ll call you later . ”
140193	140198	140199	140199	Patrick	372	“ No , Tristan , ”
140202	140207	140208	140208	He	372	“ Please come in . ”
140213	140218	140219	140219	He	372	“ Do n’t go . ”
140274	140281	140282	140282	I	3245	“ Get out of the car , ”
140292	140299	140300	140300	I	3245	“ Get out of the car , ”
140312	140321	140308	140308	Harry	348	“ Get out of the car , Harrison . ”
140322	140329	140330	140330	I	3245	“ I ’m going with Tristan . ”
140374	140382	140383	140383	I	3245	“ You will do no such thing . ”
140397	140402	140403	140403	he	372	“ Let me go ! ”
140411	140419	140406	140406	he	372	“ I want to stay with him . ”
140484	140489	140490	140490	Harry	348	“ I hate you , ”
140493	140499	140500	140500	He	348	“ Make him come back . ”
140508	140515	140516	140516	Patrick	372	“ You ruined everything , Mom ! ”
141015	141019	141020	141020	I	3245	“ Did I ? ”
141023	141033	141020	141020	I	3245	“ Because it sure does n’t feel like it . ”
141148	141158	141141	141141	He	276	“ I feel like I betrayed my best friend . ”
141178	141197	141198	141198	I	3245	“ Oh God , I ’m done with this stress . Why is nothing damn easy with me ? ”
141201	141212	141198	141198	I	3245	“ Why does everything have to be so fucking hard ? ”
141536	141539	141540	141540	I	3245	“ Reply , ”
141569	141574	141576	141576	he	276	“ Reply , baby . ”
142009	142012	142013	142013	I	3245	“ Hi . ”
142016	142019	142020	142020	He	3029	“ Hello . ”
142117	142124	142101	142101	He	3029	“ Do you want a drink ? ”
142125	142130	142134	142134	he	3029	“ No , thanks . ”
142144	142154	142139	142139	His	3029	“ Tristan . . . what I said yesterday — ”
142155	142158	142159	142159	he	3029	“ Yes , ”
142164	142171	142159	142159	he	3029	“ Let ’s talk about that . ”
142180	142207	142208	142208	I	3245	“ You need to understand where I am coming from . I love you . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . ”
142211	142214	142208	142208	I	3245	“ But ? ”
142215	142238	142239	142239	He	3029	“ But I made promises to my first husband . These children are his , and I need to honor his wishes . ”
142249	142261	142239	142239	He	3029	“ We decided to live in that house for a reason . ”
142262	142266	142267	142267	I	3245	“ Such as ? ”
142280	142309	142310	142310	He	3029	“ Wade wanted that house . We could have afforded better , but he wanted that house . He wanted the boys to grow up in Long Island . ”
142325	142346	142347	142347	He	3029	“ He wanted the boys to go to a public school , and yet I let you take them out . ”
142355	142377	142347	142347	He	3029	“ You would keep them in a school that is no good for them , just to prove a fucking point ? ”
142378	142381	142382	142382	I	3245	“ No , ”
142390	142409	142385	142385	I	3245	“ You were right on that one . I know you were — it was for the best . ”
142419	142445	142446	142446	He	3029	“ I ’m stressed out . I feel like I ’m losing control , and I just want things to stay the same between us . ”
142474	142498	142469	142469	I	3245	“ So . . . what you are saying , Claire , is that you want me to step in and be Wade . ”
142503	142508	142469	142469	I	3245	“ What ? No . ”
142509	142515	142457	142457	he	3029	“ Yes , you do . ”
142516	142524	142469	142469	I	3245	“ I do n’t . I swear . ”
142525	142548	142549	142549	I	3245	“ You want me to live in Wade ’s house , with Wade ’s wife . . . with Wade ’s children . ”
142554	142562	142563	142563	he	3029	“ What about fucking me , Claire ? ”
142566	142574	142563	142563	he	3029	“ Where the fuck is my life ? ”
142584	142587	142588	142588	I	3245	“ Tristan , ”
142591	142616	142588	142588	I	3245	“ I want my own wife , Claire , with my own children and to live in a fucking house that we choose together . ”
142629	142645	142646	142646	He	3029	“ You told me when we met that there were three hearts connected to yours . ”
142651	142656	142646	142646	He	3029	“ Did you not ? ”
142661	142670	142671	142671	he	3029	“ Answer me . . . fuck it ! ”
142677	142680	142674	142674	I	3245	“ Yes . ”
142681	142699	142713	142713	His	3029	“ So now that I ’m in love with those hearts , and I want them as my sons”—he
142702	142712	142713	142713	His	3029	me—“you tell me that I ca n’t have them ? ”
142717	142720	142721	142721	I	3245	“ Tristan , ”
142724	142736	142721	142721	I	3245	“ Please try and see this from my point of view . ”
142737	142744	142745	142745	His	3029	“ You ’re selfish , Claire . ”
142768	142777	142760	142760	I	3245	“ I deserve to have my own family . ”
142778	142784	142785	142785	I	3245	“ I know you do , ”
142788	142796	142785	142785	I	3245	“ I want the boys as mine . ”
142797	142800	142801	142801	I	3245	“ Tristan . ”
142806	142811	142812	142812	He	3029	“ I ca n’t . ”
142817	142853	142854	142854	His	3029	“ You know . . . my mother told me way back then . . . that they would always be another man ’s sons , that you would always be another man ’s wife . ”
142859	142878	142879	142879	I	3245	“ That you would never truly be my family — I would always be the stand - in . ”

151689	151714	151715	151715	He	1305	“ Because I ’m not proud of myself for losing Wade ’s company , and I do n’t know how you could ever be . ”
151729	151760	151715	151715	He	1305	“ It ’s your company too , Claire . Do n’t forget that . Wade may have started it , but you have flown the flag for five years alone . ”

152954	152962	152963	152963	Fletcher	1305	“ You should have had one made . ”

153106	153120	153099	153099	He	348	“ She ’s going to ruin the entire trip if she does n’t . ”
153124	153144	153121	153121	I	3245	“ Agreed . Two weeks ’ skiing in Aspen is going to be very uncomfortable if she says no . ”
153178	153188	153189	153189	Fletcher	1305	“ Of course she ’s going to say yes , ”
153192	153199	153189	153189	Fletcher	1305	“ As if she wo n’t . ”
153200	153206	153207	153207	Harry	348	“ I bet she cries . ”

153293	153302	153303	153303	Fletcher	1305	“ You ’ll ruin Christmas if you tell , ”
153306	153311	153312	153312	Patrick	372	“ I wo n’t , ”
153315	153327	153312	153312	Patrick	372	“ Stop saying I ’ll tell , because I wo n’t . ”

153411	153420	153409	153409	Fletcher	1305	“ What if we get one she hates ? ”
153421	153426	153454	153458	the man behind the counter	1305	“ We wo n’t . ”
153445	153453	153454	153458	the man behind the counter	1305	“ Can I help you , sir ? ”
153461	153464	153465	153465	Fletcher	1305	“ Yes , ”
153468	153477	153478	153478	I	3245	“ We ’re looking for an engagement ring . ”
153491	153496	153497	153497	Patrick	372	“ For my mom , ”
153500	153503	153497	153497	Patrick	372	“ Well . ”
153512	153516	153504	153505	The salesman	2312	“ How wonderful . ”

153592	153618	153589	153589	he	1305	“ Yes , eighteen - karat gold . A solitaire diamond , not too big and flashy , but the diamond has to be perfect . ”
153619	153627	153628	153628	He	1305	“ Okay . This way , please . ”
153644	153648	153649	153649	I	3245	“ Thank you , ”
153652	153659	153649	153649	I	3245	“ This could take a while . ”
153660	153682	153683	153684	The boys	2487	“ Of course . I ’ll leave you to it . I ’ll be just over here when you need me . ”
153693	153701	153702	153702	I	3245	“ Do you see any you like ? ”

153730	153740	153741	153741	Harry	348	“ You would n’t have to imagine too hard , ”
153745	153749	153750	153750	Fletcher	1305	“ That one . ”
153776	153780	153781	153781	Harry	348	“ Oh yeah , ”

153814	153833	153834	153834	Harry	348	“ I think she might like a love - heart one instead . You know , for love . ”
153842	153848	153849	153849	he	372	“ She is n’t ten , ”
153852	153860	153849	153849	he	372	“ Nobody likes love - heart rings . ”
153861	153869	153870	153870	I	3245	“ I think it would be nice , ”
153883	153893	153894	153894	I	3245	“ But maybe Mom would prefer a round one . ”
153897	153905	153906	153906	I	3245	“ Good idea , though , Tricky . ”
153923	153927	153917	153917	He	372	“ I suppose . ”
