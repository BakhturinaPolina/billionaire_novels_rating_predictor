8774	8817	8818	8818	She	435	“ I kept the e - mail short and sweet , Eli . You can finish it in ten minutes even with that blunt - fingered , caveman - style , hunt - and - peck typing method you seem to favor . ”

8991	9000	8955	8955	she	435	“ What if I do n’t like Isabella ? ”
9001	9033	8979	8979	he	432	“ Then you are welcome to call me Ms. Sawyer , but it ’s rather formal , do n’t you think ? I ’d feel enticed to call you Mr. Crane . ”
9034	9041	9042	9042	Eli	40	“ Mr. Crane is my father . ”
9073	9097	9042	9042	Eli	40	“ Then I suggest you find a suitable name to call me so I do n’t accidentally age you thirty - five years . ”

9312	9317	9318	9318	She	435	“ There you go . ”
9346	9362	9338	9338	she	435	“ I ’ll order for you , then . No preferences on what you eat ? ”

10194	10215	10186	10186	she	52	“ I do . Too much . Probably I should cook more , but I ’m so busy at work . ”
10231	10238	10216	10216	She	52	“ Lots of people need assistants . ”
10295	10302	10303	10303	he	40	“ You do this a lot ? ”

10514	10533	10534	10534	She	52	“ I should have warned you , I had them make both our entrees the same heat level . ”
10552	10584	10534	10534	She	52	“ Today is n’t my last day , Eli , but if you ’d like , I can finish up after lunch . I have another assignment that needs my attention . ”
10639	10653	10654	10654	he	40	“ What ’s it going to take to get you out of here ? ”
10747	10765	10766	10766	She	435	“ Start by telling me what had you cursing and grunting earlier . Did you hurt yourself ? ”

11219	11229	11212	11212	she	459	“ So you survived another day with Cranky Crane ? ”
11230	11235	11236	11236	Isa	435	“ I did survive . ”
11248	11258	11259	11259	Chloe	50	“ If anyone can do it , you can . ”
11268	11322	11259	11259	Chloe	50	“ I answered all of the e - mails I could , sent out letters to clients who have n’t paid in thirty days or more , sent invoices to collections for clients who have n’t paid in sixty days or more , and fielded your many , many phone calls . The good news”—she
11333	11357	11259	11259	Chloe	50	inbox—“is that the items you have to deal with are all in this folder . You can work from home if you like . ”
11358	11362	11363	11363	Isa	435	“ Bless you . ”
11386	11399	11400	11400	She	50	“ I will work from home . After dinner with my parents . ”
11406	11414	11400	11400	She	50	“ Ouch . Is this about … ? ”
11415	11418	11400	11400	She	50	“ Probably . ”
11446	11449	11450	11450	Isa	435	“ Anyway , ”
11454	11470	11450	11450	Isa	435	“ I should go before I ’m late . I ’ll walk out with you . ”
11558	11560	11554	11554	she	435	“ Fancy ”
11711	11714	11707	11707	she	83	“ character . ”
11740	11745	11746	11746	Isa	435	“ Mom . Dad . ”
11749	11756	11757	11758	Her mother	285	“ You ’re fresh from work . ”
11761	11767	11746	11746	Isa	435	“ Yes . Busy day . ”
11768	11789	11746	11746	Isa	435	“ You could have taken the time to change , Isabella . You know we prefer you dress for dinner . ”
11790	11804	11746	11746	Isa	435	“ I ’m here now , so let ’s just deal with that . ”
12002	12015	11989	11989	They	481	“ So . Why the dinner invite ? What ’s the occasion ? ”
12016	12030	12031	12032	her mother	285	“ We do n’t need an occasion to see our daughter , Isabella , ”
12041	12056	12057	12057	Isa	435	“ You do n’t need one , but I ’m sure there is one . ”
12074	12084	12085	12086	her mother	285	“ Two glasses before dinner . Is that necessary ? ”
12089	12106	12085	12086	her mother	285	“ Yes . Now . Occasion ? Is someone getting fired ? Married ? Who died ? ”
12107	12118	12119	12120	her father	419	“ We ’re promoting Josh to president of Sawyer Financial , ”
12160	12172	12173	12173	Isa	435	“ We ’d like you to attend the ceremony next month . ”
12198	12216	12173	12173	Isa	435	“ Just because you two are no longer dating does n’t mean you ca n’t support him . ”
12217	12228	12229	12229	she	435	“ Is n’t that exactly what not dating him means ? ”
12232	12242	12243	12244	her father	419	“ This is a very big win for Josh , ”
12251	12261	12247	12247	Isa	435	“ Yes , it ’s everything he ever wanted . ”
12308	12326	12327	12328	Her mother	285	“ He ’s a very driven man , darling . You ca n’t fault him for that . ”
12381	12391	12392	12392	Helena	83	“ You are still a part of this family , ”
12395	12420	12392	12392	Helena	83	“ even though you ’ve opted to go the servant route rather than take on the position we grew and pruned specifically for you . ”
12443	12475	12421	12421	Isa	435	“ Our families have decades of past business between us . It would be rude for you not to show up and support the Lindens over some petty breakup eons ago . ”
12476	12484	12485	12485	Isa	435	“ It was not petty , Dad , ”
12527	12544	12511	12511	she	435	“ Josh was more in love with Sawyer Financial Group than he ever was with me . ”
12553	12574	12545	12546	Her mother	285	“ And we broke up three years ago , which , yes , was a while but definitely not eons . ”
12575	12580	12581	12582	her mother	285	“ He ’s single , ”
12585	12591	12581	12582	her mother	285	“ And so are you . ”
12606	12617	12600	12600	Isa	435	“ I ’m not … we’re not getting back together . ”
12618	12632	12633	12634	Her mother	285	“ He ’d like to see you , though . He misses you . ”
12667	12674	12675	12675	Isa	435	“ He does n’t miss me , ”
12704	12712	12713	12714	Her father	419	“ I ’m a man , Isabella . ”
12723	12733	12713	12714	Her father	419	“ I can see when another man is heartbroken . ”
12734	12748	12749	12749	Isa	435	“ Is that why Josh has been dating vapid excuses for women lately ? ”
12800	12811	12812	12813	her mother	285	“ You ca n’t blame him for drowning his sorrows , ”
12816	12821	12822	12822	Isa	435	“ Oh , please . ”
12827	12856	12822	12822	Isa	435	“ We ’ve already spoken to him about reputation . As upcoming president of our institution , we ca n’t have another repeat of Reese Crane ’s issues . ”
12910	12916	12917	12918	Her mother	285	“ Renegades , those Cranes . ”
12921	12930	12931	12931	Isa	435	“ What do you know of the Cranes ? ”
12961	12967	12968	12969	her mother	285	“ We read the paper , ”
12982	13005	13006	13007	Her mother	285	“ Those groups of wealthy misfits are known for their rogue behavior . Sawyer Financial does n’t need that type of attention . ”
13050	13090	13006	13007	Her mother	285	“ Well , I ’m sorry to say I wo n’t be getting back together with Josh to help repair his reputation . I ’ll thank you not to pimp me out to the highest bidder in the future . ”
13091	13094	13095	13096	Her father	419	“ Isabella . ”
13103	13164	13095	13096	Her father	419	“ Do n’t use that language with us . You know our position on you and Sawyer Financial . You know we want what ’s best for you . You ’re essentially pimping out the kinds of people your mother and I casually hire and fire . Where is the commitment in your business ? To excellence ? To permanence ? ”
13195	13202	13209	13209	he	419	“ We want better for you . ”
13254	13260	13238	13238	she	435	“ You ’re our princess . ”
13304	13343	13344	13344	Melanie	42	“ Dad , I ’m happy . I tell you this nonstop . I ’m happy with what I do . I ’m good at what I do . I have thirty - two , er , thirty - one”—since

13401	13404	13405	13405	Isa	435	“ Anyway , ”
13414	13427	13405	13405	Isa	435	“ even if I wanted to date Josh , I could n’t . ”
13442	13448	13434	13434	they	284	“ I ’m seeing someone . ”
13449	13453	13454	13455	her father	419	“ Since when ? ”
13458	13464	13465	13466	Her mother	285	“ Who are you seeing ? ”
13475	13482	13490	13490	Isa	435	“ It ’s still very new . ”
13498	13507	13490	13490	Isa	435	“ I do n’t want to jinx it . ”
13598	13617	13618	13619	her father	419	“ Well , since this development is so new , you can plan on attending Josh ’s ceremony , ”
13626	13637	13618	13619	her father	419	“ Your new beau might not be around by then . ”
13638	13647	13648	13648	Isa	435	“ Is Josh going to be single then ? ”
13651	13654	13655	13656	her parents	284	“ Yes , ”
13677	13686	13687	13688	her mother	285	“ And if you happen to be single , ”
13694	13709	13687	13688	her mother	285	“ I ’m sure Josh will be overjoyed at the idea of your reconciliation . ”
13710	13716	13717	13718	her father	419	“ Splendid idea , Helena , ”
14201	14206	14207	14207	Isa	435	“ Chloe , hey . ”
14233	14241	14207	14207	Isa	435	“ Sorry , hon . No luck . ”
14242	14248	14207	14207	Isa	435	“ Did you try Tracy ? ”
14249	14259	14207	14207	Isa	435	“ Yeah , he ’s getting married that day . ”
14260	14265	14207	14207	Isa	435	“ Oh . Wow . ”
14266	14285	14286	14286	Chloe	50	“ I know . Unlucky , right ? I heard back from the other guys on your list . ”
14319	14326	14313	14313	Isa	435	“ And the rest of them ? ”
14327	14331	14335	14335	Chloe	50	“ All nos . ”
14347	14365	14335	14335	Chloe	50	“ Brandon is out of town for work , and Nathan said his wife would kill him . ”
14366	14375	14313	14313	Isa	435	“ My gosh , Nathan is married too ? ”
14376	14383	14335	14335	Chloe	50	“ Uh - huh . And Travis and”—more

14411	14414	14415	14415	Isa	435	“ Stop . ”
14422	14431	14415	14415	Isa	435	“ I ’ll have to make a plan B. ”
14432	14436	14437	14437	Chloe	50	“ Escort service ? ”
14452	14462	14415	14415	Isa	435	“ What do you need a date for anyway ? ”
14493	14506	14481	14481	She	435	“ My parents are trying to get Josh and me back together . ”
14513	14516	14481	14481	She	435	“ Why ? ”
14517	14521	14522	14522	She	435	“ The usual . ”
14527	14540	14541	14541	Isa	435	“ Breeding of the strong bloods , world takeover , yada yada . ”
14550	14581	14541	14541	Isa	435	“ I told them I was dating someone . I did n’t think it ’d be this hard to find a stand - in by the time of the banquet . ”
14596	14599	14541	14541	Isa	435	“ Crap . ”
14600	14603	14541	14541	Isa	435	“ Yeah . ”
14604	14610	14611	14611	Chloe	50	“ What about my brother ? ”
14614	14624	14611	14611	Chloe	50	“ He ’s twenty - three but very mature . ”
14625	14629	14541	14541	Isa	435	“ Absolutely not . ”
14630	14635	14611	14611	Chloe	50	“ He looks older . ”
14636	14661	14541	14541	Isa	435	“ The idea was to be discreet and keep everything professional . Plus , does n’t your brother live in Maryland with your family ? ”
14662	14666	14611	14611	Chloe	50	“ Good point . ”
14667	14672	14541	14541	Isa	435	“ Thanks for trying . ”
14691	14701	14673	14673	Isa	435	“ I ’ll work it out on my end . ”
14702	14721	14746	14746	Isa	435	“ You sound formal . Are you pretending to work in case you ’re overheard by Beast Crane ? ”
14722	14727	14673	14673	Isa	435	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
14728	14745	14746	14746	Isa	435	“ Would you settle for a pretend girlfriend ? I look great in a cocktail dress . ”
14761	14779	14746	14746	Isa	435	“ I ’ll consider it . There would be the added bonus of stealing Josh ’s thunder . ”
14780	14783	14752	14752	she	435	“ Sable ! ”
14792	14800	14801	14801	Chloe	50	“ He does not call you that . ”

14809	14823	14752	14752	she	435	“ It ’s kind of sexy , though . Do n’t you think ? ”
14850	14860	14861	14861	Isa	435	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . Got ta go . ”
14949	14952	14958	14958	her	50	“ Sable ! ”
15014	15019	15009	15009	she	50	“ Yes , Eli . ”

15151	15162	15167	15167	her	50	“ Yes . Wear something quieter . Those are disruptive . ”
15186	15192	15193	15193	she	50	“ What , like Crocs ? ”
15203	15216	15217	15217	She	50	“ Apologies , Eli , but I ’m not changing my shoes . ”
15235	15243	15217	15217	She	50	“ Fine . Then you ’re fired . ”
15244	15252	15253	15253	She	50	“ Oh , no , not again . ”
15274	15277	15264	15264	She	50	“ Refill ? ”

15450	15467	15421	15421	she	50	“ I do n’t think that ’s your business seeing as how you just fired me . ”
15557	15575	15576	15576	Her	50	“ You ’re looking for a date on my time , Sable . That is my business . ”
15621	15631	15632	15632	Her	50	“ I … It ’s not what you think . ”
15639	15659	15660	15660	She	50	“ I ’m attending a function requiring a plus - one , that ’s all . You know what ? ”
15667	15674	15660	15660	She	50	“ It wo n’t happen again . ”
15675	15678	15679	15679	He	98	“ Good . ”
15725	15755	15714	15714	Isa	435	“ If we ’re done here , I ’m calling it a day . You ’ll be glad to know my disruptive shoes and I can see ourselves out . ”
15756	15760	15761	15761	She	435	“ Very funny . ”
15839	15842	15843	15843	he	104	“ Stubborn , ”
15881	15884	15885	15885	Eli	40	“ Zach , ”
15924	15934	15935	15935	Zach	1916	“ I ’m outside . Ca n’t get in . ”
15967	15979	15950	15950	Eli	40	“ Hang on . I ’ll be down in a second . ”
15990	16007	15950	15950	Eli	40	“ Wait . We ’re good . Some woman in a white car just … damn . ”

16071	16076	16069	16069	Eli	40	“ Day - um . ”
16130	16135	16136	16136	Eli	40	“ Come on up , ”
16184	16189	16190	16190	Zach	1916	“ Who was that ? ”
16197	16205	16206	16206	Eli	40	“ My assistant . She ’s taken , ”
16219	16225	16226	16226	Zach	1916	“ Mercy . I guess . ”
16278	16285	16294	16294	Zach	1916	“ Good to see you again . ”
16422	16428	16417	16417	He	1916	“ Thank you for your service ”
16430	16436	16417	16417	He	1916	“ Tough break , buddy . ”
16457	16463	16464	16464	Zach	1916	“ I ’m sorry for … ”
16477	16484	16467	16467	Eli	40	“ Yeah , thanks . Beer ? ”
16485	16488	16467	16467	Eli	40	“ Sure . ”
16506	16510	16500	16500	Eli	40	“ Nickel tour ? ”
16511	16515	16516	16516	Zach	1916	“ Hit me , ”
16541	16583	16538	16538	he	1916	“ Home gym equipped with rehabilitation equipment . You may have noticed I do n’t have to worry about widening the doorways since I ’m not in a wheelchair , but if I did , I only have a few . The bedroom”—he
16590	16617	16538	16538	he	1916	hallway—“office and bathrooms . Other than that , I have no problem getting around in here . Some soldiers are n’t as fortunate as I am . ”
16651	16667	16668	16668	Eli	40	“ Like the two men who died from the grenade that blew my leg off , ”
16738	16782	16724	16724	Eli	40	“ Injured men and women come home from the military to apartments and homes with narrow hallways , doorways , countertops that are too tall , and various other obstacles that make it difficult to feel like you ’ll ever return to normal . ”
16788	16791	16724	16724	Eli	40	“ normal , ”
16930	16947	16913	16913	Zach	1916	“ Do n’t get a lot of use out of that area , I ’m guessing ? ”
16948	16951	16952	16952	Eli	40	“ No . ”
17211	17219	17220	17220	Zach	1916	“ What do you need from me ? ”
17273	17327	17245	17245	Eli	40	“ I ’d like to provide a service for our soldiers who come home with less than they had when they left . You ’re a good contractor . You know good people . And if you give me a decent rate , we can help a lot of men and women acclimate . ”
17332	17344	17345	17345	Eli	40	“ What ’s in it for you is the free advertising , ”
17370	17406	17354	17354	Eli	40	“ I ’ll mention your company on the website , on the flyers , and at every event held to raise money . Ferguson Builders will be synonymous with reliable work and a golden heart . ”
17407	17411	17412	17412	Zach	1916	“ Golden heart . ”

20648	20680	20642	20642	Isa	435	“ Now it ’s less about the challenge and more of a concern . Will I be able to replace myself with another assistant ? Who would put up with him ? ”
20714	20722	20723	20723	Chloe	50	“ I do n’t know , Isa . ”
20731	20770	20723	20723	Chloe	50	“ If he ’s not going to cooperate , maybe you should give up on the Cranes altogether . They may have wealthy contacts in Chicago , but they ’re not the only rich people who live here . ”

21376	21401	21366	21366	Isa	435	“ Too bad you ’re taken , doll . Not to be overly forward but I ’d have asked you out today if not . ”
21402	21405	21406	21406	Chloe	50	“ Taken ? ”
21416	21435	21409	21409	Zach	1916	“ Uh , dating ? Betrothed ? We d ? Not sure what y’ all say up here . ”

21673	21691	21662	21662	Chloe	50	“ Good Lord , the testosterone … I’m not used to that much packed into one person . ”
21759	21769	21770	21770	Chloe	50	“ What did Eli mean by you being taken ? ”
21790	21804	21805	21805	Isa	435	“ I do n’t know . But I ’m going to find out . ”
21821	21830	21805	21805	Isa	435	“ Use the company credit card for lunch . ”
21831	21846	21847	21847	Chloe	50	“ Wait ! Do n’t leave me here ! What if he comes back ? ”

22137	22176	22125	22125	Eli	40	“ I ran into him at Elsa ’s just now . Or , rather , he ran into me . He let me know he would have asked me out if I wasn’t — and I quote—‘taken . ’ ”
22177	22186	22187	22187	Eli	40	“ He should n’t be asking you out . ”
22199	22206	22207	22207	She	435	“ That ’s not my problem . ”
22213	22225	22207	22207	She	435	“ My problem is that someone told him I was taken . ”
22253	22268	22269	22269	Eli	40	“ You ’re not to date Crane employees while you ’re working for me , ”
22272	22286	22287	22287	She	435	“ I ’m not aware of any Crane business Mr. Ferguson is doing . ”
22297	22305	22287	22287	She	435	“ The answer is no , Sable . ”
22306	22324	22364	22364	She	435	“ You do n’t have any right to tell me who I can and ca n’t date . ”

35647	35652	35653	35653	she	435	“ Felt like one , ”
35663	35695	35653	35653	she	435	“ But without the marriage part . Josh planned on taking the position of president , and he said I could be VP or run staffing . Whatever made me happy . ”

35864	35925	35857	35857	she	435	“ My parents would n’t care that Josh dated me only to climb the ladder . They care about appearances as much as he does . Whenever the topic of my running a firm for assistants comes up , I can see the embarrassment on their faces . I may as well have gone into trash collection or cleaning hotels . ”
35926	35931	35932	35932	Eli	40	“ Both honorable positions , ”
35971	35982	35962	35962	Isa	435	“ I’m … I did n’t mean it like that . ”
35983	35987	35988	35988	He	398	“ I know . ”
36065	36077	36088	36088	She	435	“ No other secrets about your vocation or parentage , then ? ”
36078	36087	36088	36088	She	435	“ No , I think that ’s it . ”
36092	36096	36097	36097	Eli	40	“ All right . ”
36162	36188	36154	36154	He	40	“ So this Josh ? You want me there because of him ? Or were you serious about men , plural , hitting on you ? ”
36189	36202	36154	36154	He	40	“ Ugh . That probably made me sound completely full of myself . ”
36203	36211	36212	36212	He	40	“ Not completely . Only a little . ”
36237	36262	36154	36154	He	40	“ My mother believes if she can get Josh and me into the same room , we ’ll fall into each other ’s arms . ”
36263	36271	36272	36272	He	40	“ Because proximity is equal to attraction . ”
36304	36307	36308	36308	Isa	435	“ Sometimes , ”
36346	36356	36336	36336	He	40	“ Stay put . I ’ll get your door . ”
36400	36409	36410	36410	he	40	“ I see your point about the stubbornness , ”
36419	36426	36427	36427	Her	435	“ Takes one to know one . ”
36468	36471	36472	36472	His	40	“ Fuck . ”
36492	36495	36485	36485	her	435	“ Wait . ”
36547	36555	36556	36556	She	435	“ Can we use the side entrance ? ”
36581	36592	36556	36556	She	435	“ These shoes and stairs do n’t go well together . ”
36679	36682	36683	36683	she	435	“ Please ? ”
36785	36789	36790	36790	Eli	40	“ Invitation only , ”
36793	36803	36804	36804	He	40	“ Trust me . I ’m on the list . ”
36841	36852	36853	36853	she	435	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re getting cold feet , ”
36856	36863	36853	36853	she	435	“ I need you in there . ”
37064	37073	37074	37074	Eli	40	“ I ’m guessing that ’s your mother , ”
37077	37083	37074	37074	Eli	40	“ Green dress , right ? ”
37084	37095	37074	37074	Eli	40	“ Good eye . Helena Sawyer in the ageless flesh . ”
37096	37102	37103	37103	He	40	“ You look like her . ”
37115	37124	37074	37074	Eli	40	“ I ’ll take that as a compliment . ”
37125	37129	37074	37074	Eli	40	“ You should . ”
37130	37142	37143	37143	she	83	“ My height is from my father ’s side , though , ”
37300	37314	37315	37315	Eli	40	“ Were you assigned to sit next to someone you do n’t like ? ”
37323	37332	37333	37333	She	83	“ Well , that ’s a long list . ”
37351	37367	37339	37339	he	889	“ I was hoping for a table in the back so I could slip out . ”
37368	37387	37388	37388	Eli	40	“ That ’s why you brought me , Sable . You do n’t have to run or hide . ”
37465	37468	37459	37460	her mother	285	“ Isabella ? ”
37508	37510	37504	37511	big fans of the “ renegade ” Cranes	898	“ renegade ”
37513	37524	37525	37526	Her mother	285	“ Are you going to introduce me to your date ? ”
37542	37552	37525	37526	Her mother	285	“ Of course . Helena Sawyer , Eli Crane . ”
37566	37571	37582	37582	Helena	83	“ Oh , really . ”
37591	37603	37582	37582	Helena	83	“ I was n’t aware Isa knew the Cranes … intimately . ”
37626	37634	37635	37635	Isa	435	“ We are acquainted professionally as well , ”
37644	37648	37649	37649	mother	285	“ Josh will be disappointed”—her
37655	37667	37649	37649	mother	285	Eli—“if you do n’t congratulate him personally before we get started . ”
37680	37690	37668	37668	She	83	“ If you ’ll excuse us for a moment . ”
37691	37701	37702	37702	Eli	40	“ No , I do n’t think I will , ”
37710	37721	37705	37705	Helena	83	“ We came together , did n’t we , Sable ? ”
37773	37777	37778	37778	Isa	435	“ Thank you , ”
37793	37805	37806	37806	he	40	“ You do n’t have to play nice , you know , ”
37812	37824	37826	37826	she	83	“ I do if I hope to blend with this crowd . ”
37842	37852	37839	37840	Sawyer Financial	54	“ I was hoping to make a good impression . ”
37853	37882	37889	37889	she	83	“ We will . But it does n’t mean you have to adhere to the rules they set before you left . And you did leave , Sable . ”
37900	37912	37913	37913	Eli	40	“ In fact , let ’s have a cocktail before introductions . ”
37921	37926	37913	37913	Eli	40	“ He can wait . ”
37927	37931	37932	37932	she	83	“ He can , ”
37968	37971	37951	37951	Eli	40	“ Helena . ”
37980	37989	37977	37977	he	40	“ We ’ll join you in a few . ”
38054	38067	38068	38068	Eli	40	“ You need to brief me before I talk to this guy . ”
38111	38135	38136	38136	she	435	“ All you have to do is say ‘ Nice to meet you ’ and then we ’ll go back to our table , ”
38139	38144	38136	38136	she	435	“ No briefing necessary . ”
38145	38161	38162	38162	He	40	“ I promise you , I will not say ‘ Nice to meet you . ’ ”
38175	38183	38162	38162	He	40	“ How long did you date him ? ”
38184	38189	38218	38218	she	435	“ What ? Why ? ”
38202	38206	38207	38207	he	40	“ Champagne okay ? ”
38210	38214	38193	38193	he	40	“ I guess . ”
38232	38237	38225	38225	He	40	“ Wine ? Beer ? ”
38242	38254	38238	38238	Her	435	“ I ’d love a beer but that ’s really inapprop — ”
38255	38260	38261	38261	he	40	“ Two Stella Artois , ”
38272	38276	38277	38278	the bartender	907	“ Frosted glass ? ”
38281	38284	38289	38289	he	40	“ Bottles . ”
38308	38326	38289	38289	he	40	“ You do n’t strike me as the type to conform in a crowd , Isabella Sawyer . ”
38327	38335	38336	38336	She	435	“ Being here … around my parents . ”
38341	38354	38336	38336	She	435	“ I feel like a child around them — a misbehaving one . ”
38355	38373	38289	38289	he	40	“ So if I were n’t here , you ’d choke down champagne you do n’t want ? ”
38374	38382	38383	38383	Her	435	“ My mother says ladies drink champagne . ”
38498	38522	38523	38523	He	908	“ Trust me , Sable . No one will mistake you for anything less than a lady . Even holding a beer bottle . ”
38539	38551	38523	38523	He	908	“ I think you ’re more of a catch with it . ”
38565	38568	38569	38569	he	908	“ Now , ”
38572	38578	38569	38569	he	908	“ Let ’s hear it . ”
38579	38583	38569	38569	he	908	“ Hear what ? ”
38584	38595	38596	38596	He	908	“ Whatever I need to know about this Josh guy . ”
38627	38635	38659	38659	He	908	“ What do you need to know ? ”
38636	38643	38659	38659	He	908	“ Did you live with him ? ”
38644	38647	38648	38648	She	435	“ No . ”
38654	38658	38648	38648	She	435	“ Thank God . ”
38704	38709	38710	38710	he	908	“ Were you engaged ? ”
38713	38717	38675	38675	she	435	“ Definitely not . ”
38718	38726	38692	38692	he	908	“ How long did you date him ? ”
38727	38734	38735	38735	she	435	“ Are you writing a book ? ”
38738	38744	38745	38745	he	908	“ Journal entry , maybe , ”
38752	38755	38756	38756	She	435	“ Sorry . ”
38766	38775	38756	38756	She	435	“ I ’m beginning to regret coming here . ”
38776	38781	38782	38782	She	435	“ Why did you ? ”
38795	38806	38807	38807	Eli	40	“ I do n’t like going into enemy territory blind , ”
38832	38841	38807	38807	Eli	40	“ I ’ve got your six , Sable . ”
38918	38930	38931	38931	she	435	“ Josh and I dated on and off for five years , ”
38934	38942	38931	38931	she	435	“ We split around three years ago . ”
38943	38947	38948	38948	He	1916	“ Five years . ”
38984	38992	38993	38993	She	435	“ And you want me here because … ”
39009	39049	38993	38993	She	435	“ Because I want both Josh and my parents to know I ’m not going to date him again . He once delivered an ultimatum that I choose his dream or my own or we could n’t be together . ”
39050	39055	38993	38993	She	435	“ So you left . ”
39069	39076	39064	39064	Isa	435	“ Actions speak louder than words . ”
39077	39089	39090	39090	Eli	40	“ So you ’re saying you ’re looking for some action . ”
39125	39134	39114	39114	she	435	“ That ’s not what I ’m saying . ”
39135	39143	39114	39114	she	435	“ Well that ’s what I heard . ”
39260	39265	39266	39266	Eli	40	“ Okay , Sable , ”
39281	39294	39266	39266	Eli	40	“ Let ’s you and I go see this ex of yours . ”
39325	39327	39322	39322	he	93	“ six ”
39533	39544	39545	39546	Her mother	285	“ Josh , look who ’s come to congratulate you . ”
39557	39562	39563	39563	Josh	93	“ Hi , Bella , ”
39569	39576	39563	39563	Josh	93	“ Nice to see you again . ”
39590	39597	39598	39598	Helena	83	“ Accompanying her is Elijah Crane . ”
39620	39624	39625	39625	Josh	93	“ Mr. Crane , ”
39628	39652	39625	39625	Josh	93	“ I read a piece in the Trib about you when you came home . Honorably discharged . Thank you for your service . ”
39719	39726	39727	39727	Helena	83	“ If you ’ll excuse me , ”
39730	39741	39745	39745	she	435	“ I have to go say hello to the Kitchers . ”
39761	39767	39768	39768	Josh	93	“ Bella , you look … ”
39776	39780	39768	39768	Josh	93	“ Very pink . ”
39781	39791	39792	39792	Eli	40	“ Gorgeous is the word you ’re looking for , ”
39808	39821	39801	39801	Josh	93	“ Seemed an inappropriate observation to make since you two are together . ”
39854	39866	39867	39867	she	435	“ There was never a chance we ’d get back together , ”
39882	39897	39871	39871	Josh	93	“ Still enamored with serving others , are you ? Do you serve him ? ”
39898	39904	39905	39905	Eli	40	“ We ’re done here . ”
39937	39961	39931	39931	she	435	“ We ’ve both known for years we did n’t want the same things , Josh . Why would you want me back ? ”
39962	39992	39994	39994	Eli	40	“ Your parents want you back , Bella . You left them high and dry . Their only child not taking over the business when they needed you most . ”
39998	40010	39994	39994	Eli	40	“ I understand what the two of you have in common . ”
40031	40044	40011	40011	Eli	40	“ You have two seconds to get the fuck away from us . ”
40062	40084	40057	40057	he	93	“ We ’re in public , Crane . I ’d hate to see you make the paper for an unbecoming reaction . ”
40085	40088	40092	40092	Eli	40	“ One . ”
40137	40141	40142	40142	Josh	93	“ Very well . ”
40164	40169	40152	40152	He	93	“ Enjoy the party . ”
40185	40192	40193	40193	she	435	“ He ’s good at that , ”
40197	40215	40193	40193	she	435	“ Saying the right words to ignite your temper , then walking away cool as a cucumber . ”
40216	40225	40226	40226	Eli	40	“ What did you see in that asshole ? ”
40236	40263	40226	40226	Eli	40	“ I wish I could remember . I was a different person when he and I dated . He ’d rage and I ’d step down . ”
40264	40272	40273	40273	Eli	40	“ What kind of rage , Isa ? ”
40300	40310	40286	40286	He	40	“ Did he ever … Did he hit you ? ”
40311	40316	40317	40317	She	435	“ Eli . No . ”
40339	40362	40334	40334	He	93	“ Nothing like that . He delivered an ultimatum when he was n’t successful at getting my compliance . That ’s it . ”
40363	40368	40369	40369	Eli	40	“ That ’s enough . ”
40390	40394	40378	40378	his	40	“ This scar ? ”
40395	40407	40408	40408	She	435	“ I fell out of a tree when I was eight . ”
40440	40452	40453	40453	he	40	“ You do n’t want to be here , do you ? ”
40467	40480	40456	40456	She	435	“ The only good part about being here is being with you . ”
40536	40547	40524	40524	he	40	“ Then let ’s get the hell out of here . ”
40693	40702	40703	40703	he	40	“ I cut the buttons off your shirt , ”
40717	40725	40703	40703	he	40	“ Uh . Yes . I remember . ”
40726	40735	40703	40703	he	40	“ You were n’t scared of me then ? ”
40736	40741	40742	40742	she	435	“ Of course not , ”
40783	40790	40791	40791	he	40	“ Because I ’m so cuddly ? ”
40836	40859	40860	40860	She	435	“ When I was with Josh , I was different . I did n’t know what I wanted . Now I do … ”
40880	40911	40860	40860	She	435	“ Josh never loved me for me . He loved the idea of our partnership . Like my parents , he was enamored with the dollhouse style of our coupling . ”
40968	40982	40983	40983	he	40	“ It ’s hard to be with someone who does n’t know you , ”
41027	41042	41004	41004	Isa	435	“ Do your parents know the real story behind why you and Josh split ? ”
41043	41066	41021	41021	she	435	“ No . They think I went rogue and dumped him along with Sawyer Financial . They thought it was a phase . ”
41067	41082	41083	41083	He	40	“ Oh , right . The start - your - own - business phase . ”
41156	41191	41240	41240	he	40	“ My family and Josh ’s family go way back . The Lindens have been friends with the Sawyers for generations . My parents fear ill will and a bad reputation over all else . ”
41192	41208	41209	41209	He	40	“ So you show up to your ex - boyfriend ’s ceremony with Eli Crane ? ”
41216	41231	41209	41209	He	40	“ You were a last resort , so you ca n’t possibly feel used . ”
41232	41239	41240	41240	he	40	“ Thanks . That ’s touching , ”
41257	41265	41248	41248	Her	942	“ I … That came out wrong . ”
41266	41271	41272	41272	he	40	“ It ’s okay , ”
41334	41363	41317	41317	He	40	“ To Josh , I was a yellow - brick road leading to the wizard . Have n’t you had someone date you because of who you were ? ”
41376	41398	41317	41317	He	40	“ I guess that makes sense . You ’re not exactly using your family ’s name to advance , are you ? ”
41399	41404	41405	41405	he	40	“ Neither are you , ”
41409	41436	41405	41405	he	40	“ Sable Concierge is n’t tied to them in name , and I assume you did n’t borrow a hefty loan from them to start it . ”
41437	41447	41451	41451	her	944	“ Not from them . Not from Sawyer Financial . ”
41497	41501	41502	41502	He	40	“ Isabella Sawyer . ”
41528	41531	41502	41502	He	40	“ Yes ? ”
41532	41540	41502	41502	He	40	“ Would you join me for dinner ? ”
41541	41559	41502	41502	He	40	“ At this time on a Saturday night ? We ’ll wait two hours for a table . ”
41583	41597	41598	41598	he	40	“ You underestimate my reach . Do n’t you know who I am ? ”
41619	41625	41626	41626	he	40	“ This is Eli Crane , ”
41632	41639	41626	41626	he	40	“ I have a standing reservation . ”
41792	41800	41801	41802	the host	950	“ Chianti as per your standing reservation , ”
41884	41889	41890	41890	She	435	“ Color me impressed . ”
41905	41922	41899	41899	she	435	“ How ’d you get us in here ? Does the owner owe you a favor ? ”
41923	41933	41934	41934	Eli	40	“ The owner ’s son was my rehabilitation guy , ”
41941	41996	41934	41934	Eli	40	“ Ex - military . We spent a lot of time together while I was learning to walk on the leg and he mentioned Benicia ’s over and over . Said once I get out and about to stop by and he ’d have a table and a bottle of Chianti waiting for me . ”
41997	42000	42017	42017	Eli	40	“ Wow . ”
42001	42010	41934	41934	Eli	40	“ He ’s a man of his word . ”
42011	42016	42017	42017	Eli	40	“ As are you . ”
42088	42105	42106	42106	she	435	“ You have a knack for making friends in spite of your trying hard not to , ”
42128	42133	42134	42134	he	956	“ Are we friends ? ”
42161	42166	42137	42137	She	435	“ I think so . ”
42181	42209	42167	42167	He	956	“ Thank you for getting me out of the ceremony . I really did n’t want to watch Josh take the reins of my parents ’ company . ”
42210	42219	42220	42220	Eli	40	“ Tell me how you started Sable Concierge , ”
42235	42252	42167	42167	He	956	“ I ’m organized . I ’m bossy . I ’m good at being an assistant . ”
42367	42389	42390	42390	She	435	“ Sounds like an organized , bossy person would be perfect running your parents ’ company . Why did n’t you ? ”
42401	42425	42390	42390	She	435	“ Sawyer Financial is n’t exactly thrilling . Besides , you do n’t appear overly eager to take on COO for your parents . ”
42426	42429	42430	42430	he	40	“ Father , ”
42439	42442	42390	42390	She	435	“ Oh . ”
42443	42455	42390	42390	She	435	“ My mother passed a day short of my fifteenth birthday . ”
42456	42462	42463	42463	Her	435	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
42533	42558	42559	42559	He	40	“ She wrecked on the highway on her way to buy my gift . The video game I wanted was in the passenger seat . ”
42568	42571	42572	42572	She	435	“ Eli … ”
42590	42605	42579	42579	his	40	“ I ’m not the best person for COO of Crane Hotels , Sable . ”
42671	42683	42684	42684	she	435	“ Your father and brothers believe you ’re perfect for COO , ”
42687	42695	42684	42684	she	435	“ They believe COO is your legacy — ”
42696	42697	42684	42684	she	435	“ Don’t”—he
42701	42707	42684	42684	she	435	hand—“give me the Batman speech . ”
42708	42713	42684	42684	she	435	“ The Batman speech ? ”
42714	42754	42755	42755	His	40	“ About how I owe Gotham a debt that would be paid in full by my suiting up and fighting crime . Or , in this case , reporting for duty at the top floor of the Crane Hotel . ”
42768	42778	42755	42755	His	40	“ Ah , this is well - tread territory . ”
42779	42789	42790	42790	he	40	“ You need mudding tires to go in there , ”
42885	42895	42879	42879	she	435	“ What is Zach ’s role in the charity ? ”
42963	42976	42959	42959	Eli	40	“ top - notch craftsmanship , styled to the individual ’s needs . ”
43022	43036	43037	43037	Eli	40	“ Zach is a commercial contractor who has worked with Crane Hotels before , ”
43050	43069	43037	43037	Eli	40	“ He can get ahold of great deals on materials and he ’s an honest , hardworking guy . ”
43070	43094	43095	43095	Eli	40	“ I would have guessed him hardworking , but he ’s a tad too charming for me to brand him ‘ honest . ’ ”
43100	43108	43109	43109	She	973	“ I ca n’t find him charming ? ”
43122	43143	43144	43144	Eli	40	“ You can as long as you do n’t get that swoonlike sparkle in your eye when I mention him . ”
43159	43178	43179	43179	She	973	“ Why , Eli Crane . I had no idea you were capable of this kind of flirting . ”
43195	43207	43208	43208	he	40	“ I used to be capable of a lot of things , ”
43401	43404	43397	43397	he	40	“ Eli ? ”
43405	43408	43409	43409	He	40	“ Yeah ? ”
43422	43429	43397	43397	he	40	“ Do you miss your leg ? ”
43468	43471	43472	43472	he	40	“ Yes , ”
43522	43527	43519	43519	his	40	“ In your journal — ”
43528	43537	43583	43583	She	973	“ That you were n’t supposed to read . ”
43538	43569	43519	43519	his	40	“ I know . I ’m sorry . I was so … intrigued . You wrote you did n’t miss it . But I would think you ’d have to . ”
43570	43582	43583	43583	She	973	“ Well , it ’d been with me my whole life . ”
43603	43656	43657	43657	His	40	“ Battle is nothing new . Men have fought brutal battles to protect what is theirs , what they love , since the beginning of time . Whenever I shipped out , I had one clear mission : keep the men and women around me safe . That was the only mission . ”
43672	43698	43657	43657	His	40	“ I ’d sacrifice a part of my body to protect others . God knows Benji and Chris gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect me . ”
43762	43790	43749	43753	a woman on a date	387	“ They gave the way you would have , Eli . They protected you . You ca n’t deny them the same right to protect their friend . ”
43791	43797	43798	43798	His	40	“ They should n’t have . ”
43818	43828	43798	43798	His	40	“ Christopher had children . Benji had a wife . ”
43829	43834	43798	43798	His	40	“ That ’s heartbreaking . ”
43835	43871	43798	43798	His	40	“ I know what it ’s like to grow up without a mom . Christopher ’s kids wo n’t ever see their father again — and Benji wo n’t get the chance to have children . ”
43919	43924	43926	43926	his	41	“ For what it ’s worth”—Isa
43930	43956	43926	43926	his	41	squeeze—“I’m glad your friends sacrificed for you to be here . If you ’d have all been lost , I ’d never have met you . ”
44000	44010	44011	44011	she	961	“ You do n’t dwell , I ’ve noticed , ”
44014	44019	44020	44020	He	41	“ No reason to . ”
44049	44118	44020	44020	He	41	“ Yes , but I think it ’s because you ’re simply not a dweller . It ’s like you said , men have been sacrificing parts of themselves as long as humans have been on the earth . You know that , you accept that . The same way you lost your leg and accepted it . The same way , ultimately , you accepted my help . ”
44119	44126	44127	44127	She	961	“ Were you inevitable , Sable ? ”
44237	44239	44241	44241	her	435	“ I admit”—she
44266	44310	44256	44256	her	435	candlelight—“you drew me in . I mean , I did n’t have a choice . You unsheathed your claws and stomped off every assistant I sent you . It was either show up myself or let you ruin my hard - won reputation . ”
44394	44403	44404	44404	he	41	“ Beauty is a rare thing in war , ”
44429	44463	44464	44464	He	41	“ When I came home , I did n’t find beauty here . Months of rehabilitation , keeping my head down and working on the Refurbs project became my focus . Then you … ”
44476	44491	44464	44464	He	41	“ You come along , Sable , and absolutely choke a room with it . ”
44518	44522	44505	44505	Her	435	“ Thank you . ”
44523	44534	44539	44539	Isa	435	“ I ’m not talking about the way you look . ”
44547	44559	44539	44539	Isa	435	“ I mean your spirit . You ’re fierce . Strong . ”
44640	44646	44633	44633	He	41	“ Come home with me . ”
44661	44664	44665	44665	Her	435	“ Um … ”
44678	44681	44682	44682	He	41	“ Sorry . ”
44695	44712	44682	44682	He	41	“ I have n’t done this in a while — a long while . Not since — ”
44713	44716	44682	44682	He	41	“ Eli . ”
44754	44764	44765	44765	she	435	“ I was going to suggest my place instead , ”
44768	44773	44765	44765	she	435	“ It ’s closer . ”
44930	44933	44926	44926	their	986	“ Sable . ”
44934	44952	44953	44953	She	435	“ I know . I did n’t even think about it when I suggested we come here . ”
44966	44982	44953	44953	She	435	“ We can go to your place . I do n’t expect you to compromise . ”
44983	44990	44926	44926	their	986	“ What are you talking about ? ”
44991	44995	44996	44996	She	435	“ The stairs . ”
45000	45012	44996	44996	She	435	“ There are a thousand stairs leading to my front door . ”
45024	45029	45013	45013	He	41	“ I see that . ”
45030	45043	44926	44926	their	986	“ But you can’t … or maybe you do n’t want to — ”
45044	45056	45057	45057	His	41	“ If you ’re having second thoughts , just say it . ”
45250	45253	45224	45224	She	435	“ Sable — ”
45254	45271	45272	45272	She	435	“ You know what ? I ’m going to go . I ’ll see you Monday . ”
46143	46147	46148	46148	he	93	“ Nice shoes , ”
46197	46201	46202	46202	she	435	“ Mr. Crane , ”
46279	46281	46269	46269	He	93	“ shit ”
46313	46323	46260	46260	her	435	“ Need you to dig into these for me . ”
46324	46332	46333	46333	She	435	“ And what are ‘ these ’ ? ”
46353	46397	46398	46398	Her	435	“ Candidates for Refurbs . I need estimates on what kind of upgrades each of them requires . Zach ’s estimations are in there , along with my budget . You can go through and tell me what fits and what does n’t . ”
46404	46414	46398	46398	Her	435	“ I also need you to schedule the construction . ”
46415	46421	46422	46422	She	435	“ Schedule … the construction ? ”
46432	46440	46422	46422	She	435	“ Eli , I know nothing about — ”
46441	46473	46398	46398	Her	435	“ There is an estimate of man - hours and materials in the folder from Zach . If you have questions , call him . His phone number is in there . ”
46502	46509	46510	46510	he	1012	“ Why are you wearing those ? ”
46516	46519	46520	46520	She	435	“ These ? ”
46528	46564	46520	46520	She	435	“ I wear them when I drive . My eyes have been getting tired from staring at a computer day and night . I do have to actually run Sable Concierge in addition to working here doing”—she
46567	46572	46520	46520	She	435	folder—“construction scheduling , apparently . ”
46599	46609	46610	46610	She	435	“ You sure you want me to call Zach ? ”
46620	46625	46626	46626	He	1012	“ Be my guest . ”
46767	46784	46785	46785	he	1012	“ My lunch is prepared for the week , so I wo n’t be needing takeout , ”
46820	46850	46811	46811	He	1012	“ I have a coffeemaker in my office now , so you ’re off coffee duty . You have your orders , Sergeant . I suggest you get started . ”
46974	46977	46978	46978	she	435	“ Fine , ”
47199	47210	47191	47191	she	435	“ Sorry I freaked out . Care to try again ? ”
47633	47636	47620	47620	His	87	“ Eli ! ”
47701	47705	47706	47706	His	87	“ Get out ! ”
47728	47732	47733	47733	Her	87	“ What happened ? ”
47751	47754	47755	47755	His	87	“ Go ! ”
47830	47836	47837	47837	she	87	“ Is it your knee ? ”
47875	47881	47867	47867	she	87	“ Is it your knee ? ”
47882	47885	47886	47886	he	87	“ Foot , ”
47946	47949	47950	47950	he	87	“ No , ”
47966	47982	47983	47983	She	87	“ I ’m going to help . Do you want to stop hurting or not ? ”
48036	48052	48058	48058	she	87	“ You have to trust me . It ’s nothing I have n’t seen before . ”
48061	48071	48058	48058	she	87	“ The morning you were doing sit - ups ? ”
48072	48083	48084	48084	He	87	“ You mean when you could n’t look at me ? ”
48146	48167	48130	48130	She	87	“ I could n’t look at you that day because I was so attracted to you I could n’t breathe . ”
48192	48204	48183	48183	His	87	“ Eli . Let me go so I can help you . ”
48252	48255	48241	48241	She	87	“ Here ? ”

48388	48399	48400	48400	She	87	“ I was n’t sure I was doing that right . ”
48417	48422	48423	48423	he	87	“ It ’s stupid , ”
48426	48467	48423	48423	he	87	“ It not stupid . You suffered a major injury . One that took the lives of two of your friends and literally took a part of you . There ’s nothing stupid about what happened to you , Eli . ”
48520	48526	48530	48530	he	87	“ Saturday night , I — ”
48672	48678	48679	48679	he	87	“ Tell me to stop , ”
48684	48687	48688	48688	She	87	“ Why ? ”

48707	48710	48711	48711	He	87	“ Yes . ”
48720	48743	48711	48711	He	87	“ But I do n’t want to stop , Sable . Not until you ’re naked and satisfied and out of breath . ”
48752	48765	48744	48744	She	87	“ Then I ’d be a fool to ask you to stop . ”
48766	48769	48770	48770	His	87	“ Agreed . ”
48864	48872	48873	48873	she	87	“ If only you had your knife , ”
48882	48891	48873	48873	she	87	“ This process could be so much faster . ”
48892	48898	48899	48899	His	87	“ Do n’t tempt me . ”

49423	49433	49434	49434	She	87	“ Yes to you . Yes to right now . ”
49473	49478	49458	49458	she	87	“ Yes to this . ”
49527	49532	49533	49533	she	87	“ What say you ? ”
49574	49580	49581	49581	He	40	“ In case of emergency . ”
49591	49597	49581	49581	He	40	“ This is an emergency . ”
49651	49661	49643	49643	He	40	“ Do you always keep condoms in your office ? ”
49662	49665	49666	49666	He	40	“ No . ”
49815	49820	49821	49821	She	435	“ Been a while . ”
49830	49837	49838	49838	He	40	“ For me or for you ? ”
49863	49868	49869	49869	she	435	“ Me , definitely , ”
49872	49877	49869	49869	she	435	“ You , probably . ”
49878	49885	49886	49886	Sheathed	167	“ Maybe I ’ve been waiting . ”
49902	49905	49869	49869	she	435	“ For ? ”
49906	49909	49914	49914	he	40	“ You . ”
49923	49930	49914	49914	he	40	“ What were you waiting for ? ”
49987	49990	49991	49991	she	1032	“ You , ”
50046	50053	50029	50029	He	40	“ Sable . Are you okay ? ”
50092	50101	50102	50102	She	435	“ I ’m better than okay , Eli . ”
50144	50147	50137	50137	His	40	“ Fuck . ”
50148	50151	50159	50159	she	435	“ Hey . ”
50174	50180	50159	50159	she	435	“ We ’ve got this . ”
50436	50439	50440	50440	He	40	“ Sorry . ”
50450	50456	50440	50440	He	40	“ I owe you one . ”
50483	50490	50491	50491	His	40	“ Maybe I ’m not sorry . ”
50520	50525	50526	50526	She	435	“ No apologies necessary . ”
50573	50591	50592	50592	She	435	“ It ’s understandable you did n’t notice my enjoyment since I laid yours on pretty thick . ”
50603	50609	50592	50592	She	435	“ Emphasis on the thick . ”
50622	50627	50628	50628	She	435	“ I like this . ”
50636	50652	50628	50628	She	435	“ I ’ve been trying to get you to smile since I started working here . ”
50653	50663	50664	50664	He	40	“ Well now you know how to do it . ”
50751	50755	50735	50735	She	435	“ You should — ”
50756	50760	50735	50735	She	435	“ I should — ”
50767	50770	50771	50771	she	435	“ Right , ”
50774	50784	50771	50771	she	435	“ Do you need my help with … anything ? ”
50785	50788	50792	50792	he	40	“ No . ”
50800	50815	50792	50792	he	40	“ I have it . If you could just … give me a minute . ”
50816	50825	50826	50826	She	435	“ Oh , sure . I ’ll just … ”
50846	50851	50852	50852	she	435	“ Be out there , ”

51559	51566	51547	51547	she	52	“ Next time fire me first . ”
51576	51579	51567	51567	His	40	“ Deal . ”
51695	51701	51688	51688	he	40	“ I ’ll do it . ”

51848	51851	51837	51837	he	40	“ Morning . ”
51918	51930	51931	51931	she	52	“ I was n’t sure what I ’d walk into today , ”
51937	51946	51931	51931	she	52	“ Your lips , as it turns out . ”
52062	52070	52071	52071	she	52	“ Are you having any pain today ? ”
52080	52089	52090	52090	His	40	“ Some . Nothing I ca n’t handle . ”
52116	52131	52111	52111	he	40	“ But if you want to put your hands on me , feel free . ”
52132	52137	52138	52138	She	52	“ Same to you . ”
52183	52193	52194	52194	he	40	“ What ’s on the docket for you today ? ”
52197	52212	52176	52176	she	435	“ I work for you , Eli . Should n’t you be telling me ? ”
52213	52229	52238	52238	her	435	“ You work for Reese , Sable . Do I really need to remind you ? ”
52246	52278	52176	52176	she	435	“ I have a few papers for you to review and sign off on . Plus there ’s a board meeting later this month and Reese has asked that you attend . ”
52296	52306	52307	52307	she	435	“ I think you should go to the meeting , ”
52310	52316	52317	52317	he	40	“ Oh , do you ? ”
52324	52328	52329	52329	She	435	“ I do . ”
52397	52403	52404	52404	she	435	“ Up here , Marine , ”
52417	52422	52407	52407	He	40	“ We ’ll see . ”
52431	52439	52440	52440	she	435	“ What are you up to today ? ”
52449	52467	52469	52469	his	40	“ I have work to do on Refurbs , but I ’ll be done by this afternoon . Maybe”—he
52476	52483	52469	52469	his	40	shrugged—“you and I can reconvene then . ”
52497	52502	52491	52491	she	435	“ We ’ll see . ”
53159	53162	53163	53163	he	1067	“ Damn , ”
53778	53788	53789	53789	he	40	“ Or maybe you should n’t fucking question it , ”
53807	53810	53789	53789	he	40	“ Hmm ? ”
53822	53825	53826	53826	He	40	“ Sable . ”
53889	53897	53898	53898	She	435	“ Thought you might need a snack . ”
53903	53908	53898	53898	She	435	“ Is it lunchtime ? ”
53909	53915	53898	53898	She	435	“ It ’s two o’clock . ”
53916	53919	53920	53920	His	40	“ Oh . ”
53942	53948	53949	53949	She	435	“ I debated bringing this . ”
53962	53969	53949	53949	She	435	“ I really like this blouse . ”
54001	54011	54012	54012	He	40	“ I owe you a shirt and a thong . ”
54029	54045	54046	54046	She	435	“ I ’m not worried since my underwear is safely ensconced in my lingerie drawer . ”
54058	54065	54046	54046	She	435	“ I ’m not wearing any . ”
54096	54111	54084	54084	He	40	“ You think we ’re doing this in here again , you ’re wrong . ”
54112	54122	54123	54123	Her	435	“ You did n’t like office - chair sex ? ”
54141	54161	54162	54162	Her	435	“ I liked it very much , but I believe you came in here to remind me of lunch . ”
54180	54201	54173	54173	he	40	“ I ’m going to lay you down and have a taste of what you ’re not covering with underwear . ”
54214	54221	54202	54202	Her	435	“ Like that , do you ? ”
54222	54225	54226	54226	She	435	“ I … ”
54237	54245	54246	54246	He	40	“ What ’s the matter , Sable ? ”
54255	54261	54246	54246	He	40	“ Pussy got your tongue ? ”
54265	54271	54272	54272	His	40	“ Shimmy into the bedroom . ”
54359	54362	54351	54351	his	40	“ Stop . ”
54473	54480	54481	54481	she	435	“ Messy for a military man , ”
54492	54499	54500	54500	He	40	“ I ’m not on duty . ”
54518	54539	54500	54500	He	40	“ They ’re clean . I do n’t like making the bed . More comfortable to slide into it messy . ”
54565	54569	54555	54555	He	40	“ You ready ? ”
54570	54573	54574	54574	Her	435	“ Yes . ”
54640	54644	54645	54645	he	40	“ Completely bare , ”
54657	54663	54645	54645	he	40	“ And ready for me . ”
54683	54693	54697	54697	she	435	“ That ’s going to be my tongue next . ”
54723	54732	54718	54718	Her	435	“ Do you like it fast or slow ? ”
54754	54761	54718	54718	Her	435	“ I … I’m not sure . ”
54782	54791	54771	54771	He	40	“ But you ’ve had experience with this . ”
54792	54797	54798	54798	She	435	“ Not a lot . ”
54827	54837	54819	54819	he	40	“ I mean , yeah … with … myself . ”
54861	54877	54878	54878	She	435	“ In that case , you know exactly what you like , do n’t you ? ”
54927	54934	54921	54921	she	435	“ On the bed , Sable . ”
55264	55270	55272	55272	his	40	“ Sable , lie down , ”
55296	55311	55316	55316	She	435	“ I ’ll get that . Need your eyes on the ceiling , honey . ”
55393	55401	55402	55402	She	435	“ You ’re so handsome it hurts . ”
55420	55433	55434	55434	His	40	“ Trust me , Sable . This wo n’t hurt a bit . ”
55797	55803	55804	55804	she	435	“ What do you need ? ”
55807	55810	55811	55811	he	40	“ Condom , ”
55814	55818	55819	55819	She	435	“ Let me . ”
55837	55848	55819	55819	She	435	“ Next time we ’ll slide one under the pillow . ”
55861	55870	55871	55871	she	435	“ Have n’t you learned yet , soldier , ”
55879	55888	55871	55871	she	435	“ that I like to be on top ? ”
56062	56065	56045	56045	He	40	“ Eli . ”
56219	56224	56206	56206	She	435	“ Dammit , Sable . ”
56238	56241	56225	56225	Her	435	“ Focus . ”
56242	56248	56249	56249	He	40	“ I do n’t want … ”
56267	56279	56249	56249	He	40	“ I do n’t want you to have to see it . ”
56371	56377	56351	56351	He	40	“ What did I say ? ”
56378	56384	56385	56385	She	435	“ Do you want this ? ”
56398	56404	56385	56385	She	435	“ Do you want me ? ”
56405	56411	56412	56412	His	40	“ You know I do . ”
56418	56431	56437	56437	his	40	“ Then you have to trust me . We need to work around this”—she
56440	56447	56448	56448	She	435	again—“and I ’m willing to learn . ”
56455	56459	56448	56448	She	435	“ And practice . ”
56502	56507	56508	56508	he	40	“ You ’re okay ? ”
56511	56528	56488	56488	she	435	“ Why would n’t I be okay ? You gave me the orgasms of my life . ”
56535	56544	56529	56529	He	40	“ Orgasms … as in more than one ? ”
56545	56557	56558	56558	She	435	“ You ’re a man of many talents , Eli Crane . ”
56599	56602	56603	56603	he	40	“ Bossy , ”
56622	56627	56628	56628	she	435	“ You know it , ”
56922	56925	56926	56926	she	435	“ Relax , ”
56993	56997	56998	56998	he	40	“ Keep going , ”
57008	57011	57012	57012	she	435	“ Trying , ”
57015	57019	57020	57020	He	40	“ Try harder . ”
57028	57033	57034	57034	She	435	“ Yes , sir . ”
57266	57286	57259	57259	I	0	” Chloe said as she unpacked a bottle of wine from a paper grocery bag onto Isa ’s countertop . “
57302	57310	57300	57300	I	0	” She lifted the bottle of cabernet . “
57317	57317	57300	57300	I	0	”
57318	57333	57300	57300	I	0	“ I appreciate that you have wine . It ’s been a long day . ”
57422	57429	57414	57414	Isa	435	“ Cheers to us getting laid . ”
57439	57442	57430	57430	Isa	435	“ Us ? ”
57443	57469	57470	57470	Chloe	50	“ I meant cheers to you because you ’ve gotten laid , and cheers to me for getting laid in the future . I hope . ”
57480	57485	57486	57486	Isa	435	“ It could happen . ”
57506	57532	57486	57486	Isa	435	“ Yeah , right . Do you think that hot blond from the Mexican restaurant swung in here and dropped off his number or something ? ”
57533	57548	57486	57486	Isa	435	“ I do know him now . Sort of . I could introduce you . ”
57549	57556	57557	57557	Chloe	50	“ Huh - uh , sister . ”
57565	57576	57557	57557	Chloe	50	“ We ’re not talking about that hunk of man . ”
57577	57583	57584	57584	Isa	435	“ His name ’s Zach . ”
57589	57593	57594	57594	Chloe	50	“ Elijah Crane . ”
57599	57603	57594	57594	Chloe	50	“ Spill it . ”
57604	57610	57611	57611	Isa	435	“ All right , fine . ”
57632	57653	57654	57654	she	50	“ You can stop dancing like a loon now . Eli and I did the deed . A few times , ”
57678	57680	57675	57675	Eli	40	“ JBF ”
57683	57686	57687	57687	she	50	“ JBF ? ”
57705	57710	57711	57711	She	50	“ Just been fucked . ”
57744	57766	57767	57767	Chloe	50	“ Please tell me some details — like what put that wistful twinkle in your eye . Let me live vicariously . ”
57782	57794	57778	57778	Scarlett	48	“ I ’m but a poor assistant with no social life . ”
57795	57810	57811	57811	Isa	435	“ Hmm . This is n’t a ploy for a raise , is it ? ”
57814	57819	57833	57833	Chloe	50	“ Not … immediately . ”
57826	57832	57833	57833	Chloe	50	“ It happened on Monday — ”
57853	57856	57846	57846	she	50	“ go on ”
57859	57863	57833	57833	Chloe	50	“ And Tuesday … ”
57875	57911	57870	57870	Isa	435	“ He’s … intense . There is a battle he ’s fighting and I have n’t figured out who it ’s with yet . His family ? An ex who did a number on him ? ”
57912	57916	57917	57917	Chloe	50	“ His leg ? ”
57924	57970	57971	57971	She	50	“ Yes and no . Other than his hesitation over the stairs at the Vancouver , I ’ve never seen him unsure . He walks , works out , drives … but when it came time for us to be intimate , he was uncomfortable . ”
57984	57994	57971	57971	She	50	“ I do n’t want to share his secrets . ”
57995	58008	57971	57971	She	50	“ Oh , I know . I mean , I can imagine . ”
58016	58076	58011	58011	she	50	“ It ’s like with me , he is n’t sure who to be . He ’s trying to protect me from this physical side of him , the part that is different and does n’t work the way it used to . But he ’s opened up about his past and his injury . He ’s a riddle . ”
58077	58089	58090	58090	Chloe	50	“ How do you feel when he opens up to you ? ”
58093	58096	58097	58097	Isa	435	“ Special , ”
58101	58147	58097	58097	Isa	435	“ The first time we met I did n’t dream he was the kind of man to share any personal details . I knew we were compatible after that first kiss , but I had no idea it could be deeper than a physical connection . ”
58163	58180	58181	58181	Isa	435	“ And here I thought I only needed Eli to secure my reputation in this city , ”
58211	58221	58222	58222	Chloe	50	“ You ’ve built your own reputation , Isa . ”
58233	58283	58222	58222	Chloe	50	“ You ’re an easy person to talk to . That ’s why clients love you . I receive a lot of calls from clients who only want to talk to you . You are Sable Concierge . Your empathy and honesty made this company what it is today . ”
58284	58288	58289	58289	Isa	435	“ Thank you , ”
58295	58333	58222	58222	Chloe	50	“ I believe in this company . I believe in you . No matter what happens with Eli Crane down the road , I have faith Sable Concierge will thrive because you ’re the person running it . ”
58366	58371	58372	58372	Chloe	50	“ To Sable Concierge . ”
58377	58381	58382	58382	Isa	435	“ Sable Concierge , ”
58403	58406	58407	58407	Chloe	50	“ What ? ”
58416	58433	58393	58393	She	50	“ You know , with your kind of passion , you ’d be a great partner . ”
58445	58448	58434	58434	Chloe	50	“ Partner ? ”
58449	58473	58393	58393	She	50	“ Have you ever considered going into management with Sable Concierge ? Our expanding company is currently in need of an additional supervisor . ”
58474	58480	58481	58481	Chloe	50	“ Are you interviewing me ? ”
58486	58490	58481	58481	Chloe	50	“ Over cabernet ? ”
58491	58495	58496	58496	Isa	435	“ And chocolate . ”
58521	58524	58525	58525	Isa	435	“ Now , ”
58534	58542	58525	58525	Isa	435	“ Tell me your number one strength . ”
58543	58548	58549	58549	Chloe	50	“ Easy . Dedication . ”
58557	58562	58549	58549	Chloe	50	“ What about you ? ”
58563	58572	58549	58549	Chloe	50	“ Me ? I ’m doing the interviewing . ”
58573	58577	58549	58549	Chloe	50	“ Humor me . ”
58578	58597	58598	58598	Isa	435	“ I ’m incredibly stubborn . That ’s my strength . Your turn . What ’s your weakness ? ”
58607	58615	58549	58549	Chloe	50	“ This is a trick interview question . ”
58616	58621	58622	58622	Isa	435	“ It is not ! ”
58638	58646	58647	58647	Chloe	50	“ Prove it . You go first . ”
58661	58670	58647	58647	Chloe	50	“ What ’s your weakness , Isabella Sawyer ? ”
58720	58730	58731	58731	Isa	435	“ Why , I ’m a perfectionist of course , ”
58735	58752	58753	58753	Chloe	50	“ Ha ! And a phoned - in answer ! Told you it was a trick . ”
58808	58819	58820	58820	Isa	435	“ You are kinkier than I imagined , Isabella Sawyer . ”
58883	58893	58894	58894	He	40	“ Working from bed and wearing nothing at all . ”
58919	58927	58928	58928	She	435	“ Do n’t you find sex invigorating ? ”
58984	59006	59007	59007	He	40	“ Intense , yes . Amazing , absolutely . Invigorating , not quite . All I want to do is nap . ”
59055	59059	59090	59090	His	40	“ You should . ”
59060	59064	59065	59065	he	40	“ Ca n’t , ”
59068	59073	59065	59065	he	40	“ Shit to do . ”
59074	59089	59090	59090	His	40	“ I hear you . That ’s why I gave my assistant a promotion . ”
59094	59098	59090	59090	His	40	“ Oh yeah ? ”
59099	59139	59140	59140	She	175	“ Oh , yeah . Chloe and I discussed a partnership , but we agreed her taking on the role of senior manager was a better fit . Now we have to hire a new assistant for the office . ”
59148	59170	59140	59140	She	175	“ Maybe more than one . With two people running the office , there ’s bound to be twice the workload . ”
59171	59174	59175	59175	Eli	40	“ Yeah . ”
59180	59183	59175	59175	Eli	40	“ So … ”
59192	59196	59197	59197	she	175	“ So … , ”
59200	59215	59140	59140	She	175	“ I was considering something similar with Refurbs . Hiring someone to run it . ”
59216	59219	59220	59220	She	175	“ But ? ”
59226	59237	59220	59220	She	175	“ But it ’s not easy to give up control . ”
59238	59261	59262	59262	She	175	“ No , but it ’s smart . A team can do tenfold what you can do alone . You know this . ”
59266	59286	59262	59262	She	175	“ Crane Hotels could n’t be what it is without thousands of staff members and a board of directors . ”
59316	59369	59304	59304	Eli	40	“ Without a staff , you ’re weighed down by the little things . If you found someone , or a few someones , to run the charity — handle the e - mail , flyers , website , scheduling — then you could be free of the duties weighing you down . ”
59388	59419	59420	59420	She	175	“ I can make a few calls . I know a lot of very capable people . Then you could be involved but only do what you want to do . ”
59425	59436	59420	59420	She	175	“ That sounds like you , do n’t you think ? ”
59447	59454	59455	59455	she	175	“ What would you do instead ? ”
59516	59527	59528	59528	He	40	“ Hmm . What would I do instead of work ? ”
59537	59549	59528	59528	He	40	“ Lie in bed and watch TV ? Start a harem ? ”
59550	59554	59555	59555	she	175	“ A harem ! ”
59591	59601	59581	59581	She	1123	“ Not that it makes any difference to me . ”

60213	60220	60221	60221	He	40	“ You ’re terrible at resting . ”
60309	60324	60325	60325	she	1130	“ While you were sleeping , I found two candidates perfect for running Refurbs , ”

65688	65691	65700	65700	she	435	“ No . ”
65714	65721	65647	65647	He	41	“ Wow . Are these yours ? ”
65722	65731	65732	65732	He	41	“ All of them except for this one . ”
65741	65758	65732	65732	He	41	“ Dad ’s . He has more , but that was the one he gave me . ”
65813	65824	65803	65803	Eli	40	“ I ’m assuming this is n’t a military medal . ”
65837	65840	65841	65841	His	40	“ Marathon . ”
65862	65869	65870	65870	she	435	“ Will you run one again ? ”
65880	65883	65856	65856	his	40	“ Maybe . ”
65903	65916	65924	65924	she	435	“ Your brothers did n’t know about the charity , did they ? ”
65940	65946	65934	65934	Eli	40	“ What did they say ? ”
65947	65966	65970	65970	he	40	“ They said they ’d feature Refurbs for Vets at future Crane events and help me raise money . ”
65974	65981	65934	65934	Eli	40	“ That ’s good , right ? ”
65982	65985	65990	65990	he	40	“ Yes . ”
65993	66004	65990	65990	he	40	“ I have n’t done much to deserve their help . ”
66033	66062	66005	66005	He	40	“ I do n’t understand where this is coming from , Eli . I thought we were having a good night . Your family is so great and — ”
66063	66082	66083	66083	Eli	40	“ And they ’re here for me . Because I ’m here . Not everyone gets so lucky . ”
66181	66186	66196	66196	She	41	“ You look happy . ”
66187	66193	66196	66196	She	41	“ I had my moments . ”
66242	66251	66227	66227	Eli	40	“ Benji does n’t get to be here . ”
66261	66270	66271	66271	she	41	“ The one who left a wife behind , ”
66274	66277	66271	66271	she	41	“ Sad . ”
66309	66316	66317	66317	Eli	40	“ They both left wives behind . ”
66326	66336	66317	66317	Eli	40	“ Benji ’s wife wo n’t talk to me . ”
66357	66361	66351	66351	she	702	“ Why not ? ”
66362	66371	66372	66372	Eli	40	“ Because she knows it ’s my fault . ”
66380	66467	66372	66372	Eli	40	“ She wo n’t return my calls and she ’s no longer checking his e - mail . Or if she is , she ’s not responding . Tonight , I was sitting there with my pain - in - the - ass family and got to thinking that Benji did n’t have any more moments with his family . No time with his wife or his brother or his parents . No one bringing him meals because his leg is gone . It ’s unfair . ”
66522	66538	66513	66513	she	1244	“ Eli , you ’re allowed to be happy even though he ’s not here . ”
66539	66551	66552	66552	he	1245	“ He ’s not here because I did n’t save him , ”
66559	66568	66552	66552	he	1245	“ I should have saved both of them . ”
66575	66608	66609	66609	She	1244	“ I have n’t known you for long but I know for a fact if there was any way you could have saved them , you would have — or died trying . ”
66621	66626	66609	66609	She	1244	“ Am I wrong ? ”
66627	66630	66609	66609	She	1244	“ No . ”
66644	66653	66609	66609	She	1244	“ But that does n’t change the facts . ”
66654	66658	66631	66631	She	1244	“ What facts ? ”
66659	66669	66609	66609	She	1244	“ I ’m not good for anyone , Sable . ”
66683	66690	66691	66691	She	1244	“ You do n’t believe that . ”
66742	66752	66753	66753	she	1244	“ You did n’t cause your friends ’ deaths , ”
66807	66818	66819	66819	She	1244	“ And you did n’t cause your mother ’s death . ”
66831	66841	66819	66819	She	1244	“ You ’re good for a lot of people . ”
66845	66853	66859	66859	his	41	“ What the hell do you know ? ”
66864	66882	66859	66859	his	41	“ You , who continue coming back like a kicked dog no matter how I treat you . ”
66883	66888	66859	66859	his	41	“ I do not . ”
66921	66937	66915	66915	Eli	40	“ It would n’t matter what I did , would it ? You ’d stay . ”
66938	66948	66949	66949	she	1244	“ Are you trying to make me to leave ? ”
66956	66964	66965	66965	He	41	“ I always knew you were smart . ”
67042	67055	67028	67028	She	1244	“ You asked me to stick around today ! Change your mind ? ”
67073	67119	67062	67062	Eli	40	“ If you ’re too afraid to deal with your feelings , that ’s fine . But if you ’re treating me like shit because you do n’t want me to see them , that ’s unacceptable . Not after what I thought we had . ”
67149	67172	67140	67140	she	1244	“ You do n’t have to fire me this time , Beast Crane . I quit . Enjoy being your own assistant . ”
67397	67401	67402	67402	Chloe	50	“ Just left ? ”
67409	67412	67413	67413	Isa	435	“ Yes . ”
67498	67504	67505	67505	Chloe	50	“ Are you going back ? ”
67512	67519	67520	67520	Isa	435	“ No , I ’m not . ”
67551	67554	67555	67555	Chloe	50	“ Ever ? ”
67559	67609	67618	67618	she	50	“ Sable Concierge will survive without him . You said it yourself . If he wants to behave this way , I can tie up loose ends without speaking to him . We are in the twenty - first century , you know — the height of electronic media . ”
67658	67663	67664	67664	Chloe	50	“ What about you ? ”
67688	67693	67677	67677	her	435	“ Are you sad ? ”
67756	67761	67762	67762	Isa	435	“ I ’m frustrated . ”
67768	67817	67762	67762	Isa	435	“ I ’m also unwilling to be treated the way he ’s treating me . If he wants to behave like an adult , then together we can adult . But if he wants to be a man - child , then he can do that by himself . ”
67818	67823	67824	67824	Chloe	50	“ You ’re smart . ”
67834	67859	67824	67824	Chloe	50	“ You are smart and strong and one day , I ’m going to grow up to be as strong and smart as you . ”
67860	67868	67762	67762	Isa	435	“ Chloe , you ’re my age . ”
67869	67896	67824	67824	Chloe	50	“ True . But if I had a really hot guy who was really good in bed , I ’m not sure I could walk away . ”
67904	67930	67897	67897	Isa	435	“ Well , lucky for you , it does n’t require any smarts to climb into bed with a man who is wrong for you . ”
67931	67938	67939	67939	Chloe	50	“ Is n’t that the truth ? ”
67957	67965	67951	67951	she	50	“ You ’re sure you ’re okay ? ”
67966	67971	67972	67972	Isa	435	“ I ’m fine . ”
67988	68015	68016	68016	Chloe	50	“ Okay . Let me know if you want to delegate any of your communications with Cranky Crane . I ’ll be in my new office . ”
68255	68275	68248	68248	he	41	“ Reese , I ’m working on it . I will have it to you as soon as possible . ”
68276	68281	68283	68284	his brother	268	“ You sound chipper , ”
68289	68309	68310	68310	Reese	41	“ Yeah , well , my assistant has n’t showed up for four days , so I ’m buried . ”
68330	68368	68310	68310	Reese	41	“ Four days ? I wondered why I kept getting e - mails from you instead of Isabella . I also know you ’re busy with the charity , too . Do you how I know that ? ”
68376	68383	68369	68369	Smartass	185	“ Because your girlfriend told me . ”
68384	68389	68390	68390	Eli	40	“ I was there . ”
68397	68416	68390	68390	Eli	40	“ You have my full support , Eli . You should have told me about the charity sooner . ”
68480	68485	68486	68486	he	40	“ I appreciate it , ”
68493	68511	68486	68486	he	40	“ Before Isa left , she ’d put feelers out for a manager to take over Refurbs . ”
68679	68691	68692	68692	Reese	41	“ … would appreciate your presence at tonight ’s board meeting , ”
68696	68706	68707	68707	Eli	40	“ I suck at dealing with people , Reese , ”
68710	68731	68707	68707	Eli	40	“ Is n’t it obvious ? Why do you keep insisting I come back to Crane to be around them ? ”
68774	68782	68783	68783	His	268	“ Because you belong here , Eli . ”
68794	68830	68783	68783	His	268	“ I want you there . Dad wants you there . Tag told me when we left your place Friday that the more he pictures Crane Hotels without you , the more wrong it feels . ”
68833	68842	68844	68844	his	268	“ I do n’t need a guilt trip . ”
68873	68896	68897	68897	Reese	41	“ No , you do n’t . You seem to have mastered piling it on your shoulders without anyone else ’s help . ”
68905	68916	68897	68897	Reese	41	“ Why has n’t Isa been back in four days ? ”
68917	68924	68925	68925	Eli	40	“ Because I pushed her away . ”
68957	68970	68951	68951	he	268	“ She came to console me and I acted like an ass . ”
68971	68975	68976	68976	Eli	40	“ Sounds familiar . ”
69000	69002	68992	68993	His brother	268	“ assery ”
69036	69063	69064	69064	Eli	40	“ Anyway , I ca n’t attend tonight ’s board meeting and go to Sable Concierge to get my assistant back , now , can I ? ”
69067	69072	69073	69073	Eli	40	“ I guess not . ”
69084	69096	69079	69080	his brother	268	“ The least I can do is apologize for behaving badly . ”
69097	69102	69103	69103	Reese	41	“ The very least , ”
69179	69188	69189	69189	Reese	41	“ I ’d tell you to take flowers , ”
69192	69203	69189	69189	Reese	41	“ but that was always the kiss goodbye for me . ”
69204	69222	69223	69224	His brother	268	“ I swear I do n’t know how you talked any woman into going out with you . ”
69248	69250	69239	69239	Eli	40	“ done ”
69290	69303	69304	69304	Reese	41	“ We all fuck up , but there ’s a way back , ”
69308	69337	69304	69304	Reese	41	“ Look at Tag . Mr. Fast and Loose towed in by a cute , tiny blonde who made him want commitment . He never saw Rachel coming . ”
69338	69352	69354	69354	someone	1784	“ Right , because the Cranes are allergic to long - term relationships . ”
69377	69386	69304	69304	Reese	41	“ It makes sense . Because of Mom . ”
69387	69407	69304	69304	Reese	41	“ You can keep your Freudian theories to yourself . My reasons for not settling down or getting married — twice”—Eli
69409	69427	69304	69304	Reese	41	snidely—“or coupling off like the rest of you seem content to do are more deep - seated . ”
69428	69433	69304	69304	Reese	41	“ Uh - huh . ”
69434	69438	69439	69439	Eli	40	“ Anything else ? ”
69452	69456	69457	69457	Reese	41	“ Good luck , ”
69467	69513	69457	69457	Reese	41	“ I mean with the report I sent over . Getting your assistant back is n’t about luck — it’ll take a miracle after how many of her PAs you fired . I hope she comes back for my sake . Your typos are horrendous . ”
69514	69522	69523	69523	Eli	40	“ Merina brought out your comedic side , ”
69526	69533	69523	69523	Eli	40	“ I do n’t like it . ”
69747	69750	69751	69751	Eli	40	“ Enough , ”
70164	70172	70173	70173	Zach	1916	“ They ’ll frame it out tomorrow , ”
70185	70204	70141	70141	she	435	“ Good deal . Hey , I have to go . Call me tomorrow if you need me . ”
70205	70220	70173	70173	Zach	1916	“ No , we ’re good . Just checking in . Later , man . ”
70221	70226	70227	70227	Eli	40	“ Thanks , Zach . ”
70265	70272	70273	70273	he	41	“ Oh , and you are ? ”
70506	70513	70478	70478	She	435	“ Eli . It ’s late . ”
70514	70528	70529	70529	She	435	“ I know . I got here an hour ago . Damn stairs . ”
70546	70552	70478	70478	She	435	“ That was a joke . ”
70566	70573	70574	70574	Eli	40	“ A bad one , evidently . ”
70587	70599	70574	70574	Eli	40	“ I came by to apologize for acting like an ass . ”
70600	70604	70605	70605	she	435	“ No need , ”
70689	70694	70695	70695	he	40	“ You deserve better , ”
70710	70745	70701	70701	he	40	“ Better treatment from a client and better treatment from a lover . I ’ve never been great at this stuff , and as you ’ve recently proven , I ’ve become even worse — ”
70746	70749	70750	70750	she	435	“ Eli , ”
70781	70789	70767	70767	she	435	“ Do you want to come in ? ”
70790	70802	70701	70701	he	40	“ No . I want to go out . With you . ”
70803	70806	70767	70767	she	435	“ Now ? ”
70807	70810	70701	70701	he	40	“ Please ? ”
70811	70814	70815	70815	Her	435	“ Please ? ”
70822	70853	70815	70815	Her	435	“ You were the last person I expected when I opened this door , Eli Crane . I could n’t imagine you coming here to apologize , let alone beg . ”
70854	70858	70860	70860	his	40	“ Desperate times . ”
70868	70881	70921	70921	She	435	“ Do you mind if I change out of my work clothes ? ”
70882	70887	70888	70888	Eli	40	“ Take your time . ”
70896	70920	70888	70888	Eli	40	“ I ’ll start heading down the stairs now . Maybe I ’ll be at the bottom by the time you ’re ready . ”
70982	70996	70975	70975	she	435	“ I ’ll make it up to you , Sable . I promise . ”
71104	71111	71112	71112	she	435	“ Not bad , Eli Crane , ”
71123	71129	71112	71112	she	435	“ Not bad at all . ”
71507	71510	71495	71495	Isa	435	“ Eli . ”
71589	71594	71595	71595	he	40	“ Who was that ? ”
71598	71606	71595	71595	he	40	“ Tell me you had some clue . ”
71614	71617	71618	71618	Her	435	“ I … ”
71768	71775	71782	71782	she	435	“ Sable . I ’m here . ”
71832	71836	71837	71837	He	40	“ What the … ”
71858	71871	71872	71872	He	40	“ Where are you bleeding ? What the fuck did he do ? ”
71885	71891	71892	71892	Isa	435	“ I ’m not hurt . ”
71895	71914	71915	71915	She	435	“ He grabbed me and I kneed him in the nuts and then elbowed him in the nose . ”
71941	71947	71930	71930	Her	435	“ He was a bleeder . ”
71948	71959	71960	71960	Eli	40	“ You were in the process of kicking his ass ? ”
71965	71973	71977	71977	her	435	“ He ’s lucky you showed up . ”
72010	72016	72017	72017	He	40	“ I ’ve got it . ”
72053	72062	72044	72044	he	40	“ Did n’t look like he got anything . ”
72063	72068	72044	72044	he	40	“ He did n’t . ”
72099	72106	72107	72107	He	40	“ Let ’s get you inside . ”
72248	72259	72232	72232	She	435	“ I do n’t know the number for the police . ”
72287	72295	72296	72296	He	105	“ I ’ll call . You sit . ”
72316	72319	72305	72305	Her	435	“ Sable ? ”
72324	72330	72320	72320	Her	435	“ You ’re okay now . ”
72331	72335	72336	72336	She	435	“ I know . ”
72363	72386	72347	72347	She	435	“ They might want the DNA , so you ca n’t clean up yet . Do you want some water ? Tea ? ”
72394	72403	72387	72387	Her	435	“ Do you know how to make tea ? ”
72404	72408	72409	72409	He	1336	“ Not really . ”
72439	72446	72447	72447	she	435	“ Thank God you were here , ”
72748	72752	72743	72743	He	1347	“ be in touch ”
72819	72825	72828	72828	She	435	“ I need to shower . ”
72859	72867	72868	72868	Eli	40	“ You can shower at my place . ”
72888	72897	72881	72881	she	435	“ You do n’t have to do that . ”
72898	72905	72868	72868	Eli	40	“ Then I ’ll stay here . ”
72906	72937	72881	72881	she	435	“ I ca n’t run away , Eli . I work downstairs . I live here . I ’ll have to come home eventually no matter what I do tonight . ”
72938	72969	72970	72970	His	1351	“ It does n’t mean you ca n’t come to my house . Sleep in my arms . Shower in my bathroom and dry off with one of my towels . ”
73002	73006	72995	72995	he	1351	“ Does it ? ”
73035	73038	72995	72995	he	1351	“ Sable . ”
73123	73137	73138	73138	Eli	40	“ Soap and shampoo are in the shower , towel ’s right here . ”
73168	73175	73159	73159	He	40	“ Do you want my help ? ”
73176	73179	73180	73180	She	435	“ No . ”
73187	73194	73180	73180	She	435	“ I wo n’t be long . ”
73221	73235	73213	73213	He	40	“ I ’ll be in bed . Join me when you ’re done . ”
73478	73485	73465	73465	She	435	“ I ’m sorry , Sable . ”
73509	73517	73465	73465	She	435	“ Thank you for letting me stay . ”
73555	73562	73563	73563	he	40	“ Thank you for coming back , ”
73575	73580	73581	73581	Her	435	“ Am I back ? ”
73598	73606	73612	73612	he	40	“ I sure as hell hope so . ”
73623	73629	73630	73630	He	40	“ Give me a second . ”
73995	74001	74002	74002	he	1831	“ How ’d you sleep ? ”
74012	74020	74021	74021	Hers	435	“ Better than I would ’ve thought . ”
74032	74037	74021	74021	Hers	435	“ That ’s good . ”
74038	74047	74025	74025	she	435	“ Thanks for letting me stay last night . ”
74075	74082	74067	74067	she	435	“ No thanks needed , Sable . ”
74158	74161	74162	74162	she	435	“ Eli , ”
74196	74200	74181	74181	He	1831	“ Touch me . ”
74220	74223	74224	74224	he	1831	“ Wet , ”
74233	74238	74239	74239	She	435	“ I want you . ”
74391	74398	74399	74399	she	435	“ How do you do that ? ”
74419	74423	74406	74406	He	1363	“ Do what ? ”
74424	74430	74460	74460	She	435	“ Know what I need . ”
74431	74436	74437	74437	His	1363	“ You seemed tense . ”
74453	74459	74437	74437	His	1363	“ Now you do n’t . ”
74553	74559	74560	74560	she	435	“ Your body is beautiful , ”
74585	74598	74599	74599	She	435	“ I guess guys do n’t see themselves as ‘ beautiful . ’ ”
74691	74697	74698	74698	she	1363	“ You are , though , ”
74706	74710	74698	74698	she	1363	“ Completely beautiful . ”
74801	74810	74811	74811	she	435	“ I was going to return the favor , ”
74827	74832	74833	74833	Her	435	“ Were you now ? ”
74922	74924	74920	74920	he	1363	“ beautiful ”
75020	75027	75028	75028	Her	1366	“ I like you like this . ”
75049	75053	75054	75054	His	1363	“ Like what ? ”
75079	75082	75083	75083	She	1366	“ Relaxed . ”
75122	75125	75126	75126	he	40	“ And ? ”
75142	75181	75131	75131	Her	1366	“ I was going to say open , but you ’re not open , are you ? You ’re more like a screen over a window . I can see in , but I ca n’t get in . ”
75196	75205	75206	75206	he	40	“ I’m … not skilled at being open , ”
75217	75222	75223	75223	She	1366	“ You ’re kidding . ”
75331	75341	75342	75342	She	1366	“ I ’m not sure what we have here . ”
75398	75405	75406	75406	He	2086	“ I like you , Eli . ”
75497	75501	75502	75502	she	1374	“ But … , ”
75530	75543	75544	75544	she	1374	“ … I ca n’t keep guessing what ’s in your head , ”
75579	75587	75560	75560	he	2086	“ What do you want to know ? ”
75588	75598	75634	75634	He	2086	“ Do you really believe you ’re bad luck ? ”
75629	75633	75599	75599	He	2086	“ Not exactly . ”
75648	75656	75634	75634	He	2086	“ Good things … don’t chase me . ”
75657	75674	75634	75634	He	2086	“ Life is about you chasing good things , Eli , not the other way around . ”
75727	75739	75684	75684	she	1374	“ A lot of bad things happen when I ’m around . ”
75740	75749	75750	75750	She	1374	“ Are you afraid you ’ll screw up ? ”
75753	75759	75750	75750	She	1374	“ We all screw up . ”
75760	75785	75786	75786	He	2086	“ Some screwups come with a hefty price , Sable . Screwups like letting my two men lead resulted in them losing their lives . ”
75791	75809	75812	75812	he	2086	“ Screwups like you being attacked because your attacker did n’t believe I could fight him off . ”
75815	75821	75812	75812	he	2086	“ And I did n’t . ”
75822	75825	75826	75826	She	1374	“ No . ”
75852	75860	75826	75826	She	1374	“ It ’s a fact , Isa . ”
75861	75868	75869	75869	Her	1374	“ It ’s bullshit , Eli . ”
75878	75901	75869	75869	Her	1374	“ You came for me after I left , and that was a miracle . If you had n’t showed at all … ”
75912	75922	75902	75902	She	1374	“ I do n’t want to think about it . ”
75984	75994	75995	75995	She	1374	“ What happened to me is not your fault . ”
76000	76027	75995	75995	She	1374	“ I could have been robbed , raped . He could have climbed those stairs and broken into my house while I was in the shower . ”
76036	76096	75995	75995	She	1374	“ You heard what I told the officer . That guy ’s eyes were wild like he was high on something . He was twitchy . Strange . He had n’t been lying in wait and carefully plotting . Maybe he saw you in the shadows , maybe he did n’t . It could have happened at any time . ”
76122	76142	76105	76105	He	2086	“ But if I would n’t have shown up at your door , you never would have been outside . ”
76143	76165	76183	76183	she	1377	“ If you would n’t have shown up at my door , Eli , I would n’t be here right now . ”
76202	76211	76212	76212	he	2086	“ So … you’re moving in with me , ”
76226	76238	76212	76212	he	2086	“ I have pepper spray . I ’ll be on alert . ”
76239	76266	76279	76279	Her	1377	“ And have a male employee stay late to walk you up . Finish your work upstairs and never ever head up there after dark unless — ”
76274	76278	76267	76267	Her	1377	“ I promise . ”
76391	76399	76400	76400	she	435	“ Have you ever lived with someone ? ”
76432	76435	76436	76436	he	2086	“ Yes , ”
76439	76442	76436	76436	he	2086	“ You ? ”
76443	76485	76404	76404	He	2086	“ Never . Not a romantic interest , anyway . I lived at home and with a friend from college , but I ’ve mostly been on my own . Josh wanted to move in together , but it felt wrong . ”
76486	76491	76436	76436	he	2086	“ You held back . ”
76492	76518	76519	76519	She	435	“ I guess so . I knew we were n’t right , but I ’m not sure I know what ‘ right ’ feels like . ”
76568	76574	76575	76575	Eli	40	“ Her name was Crystal . ”
76606	76649	76593	76593	he	2086	“ She and I met through a mutual friend . We dated for three or four months and then she moved in when I deployed . She said it ’d make her feel closer to me if she was around my things . ”
76715	76723	76708	76708	he	2086	“ Do you want me to continue ? ”
76733	76780	76724	76724	She	435	“ Whenever I was back , she ’d insist we go house - hunting or talk about financial plans for our future . I would be trying to acclimate to civilian life again , settle into a temporary schedule , and Crystal wanted to play house . ”
76781	76786	76787	76787	Isa	435	“ She loved you . ”
76803	76806	76787	76787	Isa	435	“ Maybe . ”
76878	76898	76870	76876	anyone who was n’t related to him	1382	“ She wanted children , a family . A house with a yard . I do n’t want that . ”
76899	76903	76907	76907	He	117	“ Not ever ? ”
76920	76945	76907	76907	He	117	“ Now I ’m not sure what I want . I ’ve changed in a lot of unexpected ways since I ’ve come back . ”
77025	77039	77040	77040	Her	435	“ So this … what we have . It ’s enough for you ? ”
77093	77114	77066	77066	he	117	“ I ’m not sure I can give you more , but I ’m not done with us , either . ”
77122	77125	77118	77118	her	435	“ Okay . ”
77126	77129	77118	77118	her	435	“ Okay ? ”
77130	77135	77118	77118	her	435	“ That ’s fair . ”
77226	77231	77232	77232	he	117	“ I need you , ”
77235	77248	77232	77232	he	117	“ So if you would n’t mind staying a little while long — ”
77930	77933	77934	77934	he	1406	“ Shit , ”
77937	77941	77942	77942	She	435	“ Licks you ? ”
77947	77958	77959	77959	he	1406	“ Likes . I typed likes . I hate texting , ”
77962	77976	77959	77959	he	1406	“ I did n’t want to interrupt your work with a phone call . ”
77977	77985	77986	77986	Her	435	“ Well , it was n’t inaccurate . ”
77994	77997	77998	77998	he	1406	“ No , ”
78002	78009	77998	77998	he	1406	“ It ’s definitely not inaccurate . ”
78023	78025	78020	78021	Eli Crane	40	“ sweet ”
78033	78043	78044	78044	she	435	“ So . Our date ? When and where ? ”
78054	78094	78010	78010	He	1406	“ Tag and his buddy Lucas are dragging me out for a beer at Dooley ’s around eight . I know you ’re working late tonight , but I figured I could leave and pick you up around nine . ”
78095	78113	78014	78014	She	435	“ Do n’t cut your drinks short on account of me . I can meet you there . ”
78114	78124	78010	78010	He	1406	“ You want to have drinks with the guys ? ”
78125	78152	78014	78014	She	435	“ Sure , why not ? There ’s no sense in you driving to the other side of town when I can easily take a cab . ”
78153	78165	78010	78010	He	1406	“ A cab ? That ’s not very gentlemanly of me . ”
78166	78176	78177	78177	She	1407	“ I never accused you of being a gentleman . ”
78187	78221	78177	78177	She	1407	“ I ’m not sure when I ’ll be done . It ’s easier to just cab it there , honestly . And before you ask , yes , I have pepper spray . ”
78222	78234	78257	78257	she	1407	“ Okay , Sable . Fair enough . See you tonight . ”
78235	78241	78242	78242	She	1407	“ I ’ll be there . ”
78281	78294	78257	78257	she	1407	“ I ca n’t believe it . Elijah Crane in the flesh . ”
78295	78309	78310	78310	Tag	308	“ Luc , he ’s not a celebrity . Do not act awestruck . ”
78319	78334	78335	78335	Eli	40	“ He ’s right . I ’m a broody loner with a bad attitude . ”
78444	78455	78456	78456	he	308	“ Do n’t suppose they could win one for me , ”
78459	78473	78474	78474	Tag	308	“ They never win . You should be used to that by now , ”
78477	78481	78482	78482	Eli	40	“ No shit . ”
78566	78598	78603	78603	Lucas	192	“ You ca n’t be that much of a loner if you have a lady friend . Is that why you keep checking your phone , then looking toward the door ? ”
78608	78611	78612	78612	Eli	40	“ Seriously ? ”
78632	78639	78612	78612	Eli	40	“ What ? I mentioned her . ”
78672	78686	78687	78687	Luc	194	“ It ’s a sight to behold — you Cranes toppling like dominoes . ”
78721	78732	78706	78706	he	194	“ I always said the right woman changes your world . ”
78733	78745	78746	78746	Tag	308	“ You always said the right woman fucks with your head , ”
78754	78757	78749	78749	Lucas	192	“ Ha ! ”
78791	78797	78798	78798	Tag	308	“ Eli does n’t topple , ”
78801	78843	78798	78798	Tag	308	“ He ’s completely in charge of his faculties around women . Isa happened to be the first to crack into his safe , but his security system is fully armed . No way has she taken anything of real value . ”
78852	78860	78798	78798	Tag	308	“ Is n’t that right , bro ? ”
78861	78864	78865	78865	he	192	“ Yeah , ”
78911	78923	78924	78925	the waitress	474	“ I ’m supposed to bring you a shot of tequila , ”
78933	78952	78953	78954	The waitress	474	“ That woman over there said you could pick a different shot if you no longer drink tequila . ”
78988	78991	78992	78992	Tag	308	“ Shit , ”
79006	79011	78995	78995	Eli	40	“ No . Thanks . ”
79012	79019	78995	78995	Eli	40	“ I ’ll let her know . ”
79020	79026	78995	78995	Eli	40	“ No , I will . ”
79027	79031	79032	79033	The waitress	474	“ Suit yourself . ”
79039	79048	79049	79049	Lucas	192	“ That ’s not Isa , is it ? ”
79062	79076	79049	79049	Lucas	192	“ Are you two doing some kinky meet - cute role - play ? ”
79077	79085	79086	79086	Tag	308	“ No , that ’s not Isa , ”
79089	79099	79086	79086	Tag	308	“ It ’s a woman from Eli ’s past . ”
79100	79103	79104	79104	Luc	194	“ Shiiit , ”
79110	79122	79107	79107	Tag	308	“ They crawl out of the woodwork , do n’t they ? ”
79190	79195	79196	79196	He	192	“ Hi , Crystal . ”
79204	79207	79172	79172	she	1429	“ Eli . ”
79208	79224	79172	79172	she	1429	“ You did n’t have to send them away . I wo n’t be long . ”
79225	79234	79239	79239	his	192	“ You did n’t have to come over . ”
79241	79249	79239	79239	his	192	“ You did n’t want the shot ? ”
79250	79268	79172	79172	she	1429	“ If you wanted to talk to me , you could have walked over and said hello . ”
79277	79292	79269	79269	She	1429	“ That ’s true . I guess I was afraid you ’d be unkind . ”
79293	79298	79299	79299	he	192	“ Sounds like me , ”
79302	79308	79309	79309	She	1429	“ Sit for a second ? ”
79330	79336	79339	79339	her	1429	“ How have you been ? ”
79366	79369	79370	79370	he	192	“ Recovering , ”
79373	79379	79370	79370	he	192	“ Working . The usual . ”
79430	79434	79422	79422	she	1429	“ Forget it . ”
79435	79440	79441	79441	she	1429	“ I was unfair — ”
79444	79447	79448	79448	He	192	“ No . ”
79462	79471	79448	79448	He	192	“ You do n’t have to say that . ”
79472	79481	79482	79482	She	1429	“ I do . If only for me . ”
79494	79506	79507	79507	She	1429	“ I should have been there for you . I was … ”
79512	79516	79507	79507	She	1429	“ I was — ”
79517	79561	79570	79570	he	1429	“ Listen , Crystal . We ’d already grown apart before I deployed that last time . When I came back , I underwent surgery , rehabilitation . I ca n’t blame you for saying I was n’t what you signed up for . ”
79598	79604	79605	79605	Her	1429	“ I did say that . ”
79610	79620	79605	79605	Her	1429	“ But … it was n’t the whole truth . ”
79673	79680	79681	79681	he	1429	“ We had a good run , ”
79688	79711	79681	79681	he	1429	“ I was n’t the person for you and you were n’t the one for me . We were delaying the inevitable . ”
79712	79717	79667	79667	she	435	“ That ’s true . ”
79755	79765	79742	79742	He	1429	“ Did you ever buy the house you wanted ? ”
79766	79771	79772	79772	She	435	“ One like it . ”
79796	79808	79787	79787	He	1429	“ And a husband and a dog . A little mutt . ”
79818	79820	79809	79809	He	1429	“ congratulations ”
79830	79852	79853	79853	Crystal	117	“ When I said you were n’t what I signed up for , I was only telling you half the truth . ”
79864	79875	79853	79853	Crystal	117	“ I left you because I ’d already met Ryan . ”
79892	79896	79897	79897	she	435	“ My husband , ”
79953	79977	79978	79978	He	1831	“ I should ’ve told you the truth , but I worried it would hurt you more knowing I ’d met someone new . ”
80033	80041	80042	80042	He	1831	“ Eli . I ’m so sorry . ”
80054	80063	80064	80064	Her	435	“ It was wrong of me to lie . ”
80090	80095	80064	80064	Her	435	“ This looks cozy , ”
80163	80168	80139	80139	He	1831	“ You ’re early . ”
80178	80182	80186	80186	herself	435	“ Crystal Billings . ”
80225	80233	80214	80214	He	1831	“ Crystal and I used to date . ”

84966	84970	84971	84971	Chloe	50	“ You okay ? ”
84989	84994	84995	84995	Isa	435	“ Sure , why ? ”
85016	85051	85010	85011	Her assistant	264	“ It ’s the boy , is n’t it ? Cranky Crane did something horrible over the weekend and it being Monday , I do n’t know what it is yet . Boys suck . ”
85052	85059	85060	85060	Isa	435	“ He did n’t do anything . ”
85086	85089	85090	85090	Chloe	50	“ Isa . ”
85113	85125	85107	85107	she	435	“ You ’re in love with him , are n’t you ? ”

85218	85224	85225	85225	Chloe	50	“ You ’re not surprised ? ”
85228	85253	85225	85225	Chloe	50	“ I have n’t dated anyone in three years and then the absolutely wrong guy comes along and I fold like an origami goose . ”
85254	85333	85225	85225	Chloe	50	“ Since you started working for him , even when he was pissing you off , you have floated around here like you were wearing hover - board high heels . I ’m not sure I ’ve ever seen you this happy and I ’ve worked with you closely for most of those three years . You were determined to take Eli on as a client and walk away . The thing is , you never walked away . ”
85334	85339	85340	85340	She	1487	“ I could n’t . ”
85354	85358	85359	85359	Chloe	50	“ You look … ”
85367	85381	85359	85359	Chloe	50	“ Well , not sad , but definitely not hover - board happy . ”
85382	85390	85345	85345	she	1487	“ There ’s a reason for that . ”
85395	85407	85345	85345	she	1487	“ Only one of us was bitten by the love bug . ”
85408	85411	85359	85359	Chloe	50	“ Oh . ”
85412	85441	85442	85442	Isa	435	“ Yeah , oh . I did n’t tell him how I felt . If I did , he’d … I do n’t know what he ’d do . ”
85447	85459	85442	85442	Isa	435	“ I ’m trying to be casual and let things unfold . ”
85460	85469	85470	85470	Chloe	50	“ You do n’t want to pressure him . ”
85476	85483	85470	85470	Chloe	50	“ He ’s had enough pressure . ”
85524	85531	85532	85532	Isa	435	“ I ’m a strong woman , ”
85535	85552	85532	85532	Isa	435	“ I can have an affair with a man and not build castles in the sky . ”
85553	85559	85562	85562	Chloe	50	“ Yes , you can . ”
85568	85571	85532	85532	Isa	435	“ But ? ”

85595	85614	85592	85592	She	50	“ I know . I just do n’t want to discourage you when you ’ve found your way . ”
85622	85649	85615	85615	Isa	435	“ A good manager is able to point out flaws pragmatically and succinctly . A good manager tells the truth . And so do good friends . ”
85650	85653	85654	85654	Chloe	50	“ Okay . ”
85662	85712	85654	85654	Chloe	50	“ You have the right to tell the man you ’re sharing dinners and evenings and overnights with how you feel , and he has the right to react to it . Do n’t keep your heart quiet for too long or you ’ll end up in love alone . ”
85713	85716	85654	85654	Chloe	50	“ Wow . ”
85720	85723	85724	85724	Chloe	50	“ But . ”
85737	85766	85724	85724	Chloe	50	“ For now , enjoy yourself . Enjoy what the two of you have . You do n’t have to tell him this second . Pick your timing . ”
85767	85783	85784	85784	Isa	435	“ After sex seems like a good strategy . He ’d probably agree to anything , ”
85790	85796	85787	85787	Chloe	50	“ You ’ve got this . ”
85825	85831	85832	85832	Isa	435	“ Lunch at Romano ’s ? ”
85851	85854	85855	85855	Chloe	50	“ Definitely . ”

88108	88121	88091	88091	He	1544	“ I ’m sorry , Michelle . I ’m so damn sorry . ”
88136	88146	88122	88122	She	1539	“ For a long time , I blamed you . ”
88168	88182	88183	88183	she	1539	“ But I ’m the one who owes you an apology , Eli , ”
88186	88191	88192	88192	He	1544	“ What ? No . ”
88223	88226	88227	88227	she	1539	“ Yes , ”
88241	88291	88227	88227	she	1539	“ Benji loved you . Whenever we ’d talk , he ’d mention you and what an amazing person you are . He talked about the advice you gave him about everything . Fixing up his old Camaro . The best kind of beer for a hot summer evening . ”
88302	88342	88227	88227	she	1539	“ He loved you , Michelle . I feel like I know you , he mentioned you so damn often . I never should have tried to get your blessing when what I was really seeking was your forgiveness . ”
88398	88406	88407	88407	she	1539	“ After Destiny arrived in my life , ”
88410	88475	88407	88407	she	1539	“ I realized things happen for a reason . Generic , right ? I was so angry every time someone would console me with that platitude , but it ’s true . Things happen . What no tells you is that the ‘ reason ’ is personal . It ’s up to you to figure out why you ’re going through what you are . ”
88491	88541	88476	88476	She	1539	“ I ’m sorry you lost your leg , Eli . And I ’m sorry I did n’t take your calls . I told myself I was busy , but I was avoiding you . You reminded me of Benji , and having Destiny without Benji hurt at first . ”
88542	88551	88552	88552	he	1548	“ You have nothing to be sorry about , ”
88556	88568	88552	88552	he	1548	“ You have to know that I would swap places with — ”
88569	88588	88589	88589	Her	1551	“ Do n’t you dare say what I think you ’re about to say , Elijah Coolidge Crane . ”
88613	88623	88597	88597	She	1551	“ Benji told me your middle name , too . ”
88642	88657	88658	88658	she	1551	“ Do n’t you dare tell me you ’d rather be in the ground , ”
88661	88688	88658	88658	she	1551	“ because I promise you there are people in your life who would be worse for it . You lost a limb , but you lived . ”
88689	88705	88750	88750	She	1551	“ I know . That ’s what has me drowning in guilt every damned day . ”
88706	88727	88728	88728	She	1551	“ Refurbs for Vets is a good thing . You ’re giving back in an active way . And yes . ”
88733	88749	88728	88728	She	1551	“ You can use Benji ’s picture on the website . I ’d be honored . ”
88761	88801	88750	88750	She	1551	“ I forgive you . I do n’t need you to be sorry , but if you need me to say I do n’t blame you or hold you accountable , believe me when I say I do n’t . ”
88854	88920	88834	88834	she	1539	“ Keep doing what you ’re doing , Eli . Benji is watching you , and he is proud . I promise . He would n’t trade places with you . If the situation were reversed , he ’d be honored if you ’d traded your life for his . Since he traded his for yours , I suggest you live yours to the fullest . ”
88921	88926	88927	88927	Eli	40	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
88967	88978	88953	88953	Michelle	1539	“ I did n’t think I ’d get that lucky . ”
88979	88986	88987	88987	He	40	“ I have to go anyway . ”
89005	89009	89010	89010	Michelle	1539	“ Thank you . ”
89049	89058	89059	89059	he	40	“ If you ’re really watching , buddy , ”
89068	89079	89059	89059	he	40	“ fuck you for telling your wife my middle name . ”
89113	89120	89121	89121	Tag	308	“ Dad is going to shit . ”
89204	89209	89210	89210	Eli	40	“ for a reason , ”
89300	89307	89308	89308	Reese	41	“ Do you need an office ? ”
89319	89334	89335	89335	Eli	40	“ I ’ll work from home , but I ’ll be here on occasion , ”
89338	89343	89344	89344	Tag	308	“ Need an assistant ? ”
89351	89363	89344	89344	Tag	308	“ Or will Isabella Sawyer be performing that duty among others ? ”
89364	89368	89395	89395	Tag	308	“ Very funny . ”
89369	89394	89395	89395	Tag	308	“ Unless she refuses to let you pay her . Rachel was that way — she did n’t want any part of my money . ”
89410	89417	89395	89395	Tag	308	“ Parts of me , however … ”
89418	89422	89423	89423	Reese	41	“ Moving on , ”
89447	89535	89439	89439	he	1563	“ There are several staff members performing parts of the position in your absence , Eli . I never truly replaced myself when I moved on from COO , so it ’s up to you how you want to run it . General operations is comprised of several jobs . You can keep the men and women I ’ve appointed in place and oversee them , or you can place them elsewhere and carve out an eighty - hour - a - week grindstone like I did . ”
89536	89545	89546	89546	Tag	308	“ Yeah , but you ’re a masochist , ”
89549	89557	89546	89546	Tag	308	“ And Eli has a new girlfriend . ”
89558	89565	89566	89566	Eli	40	“ All right . I give . ”

89640	89682	89635	89635	He	40	“ If I asked her to marry me , she ’d have a heart attack that would immediately precede my own . We ’re good . We ’re together and we do n’t feel the need to define it past that . ”
89697	89700	89692	89692	Eli	40	“ good , ”
89750	89772	89773	89773	Eli	40	“ Now that we ’re done with the small talk , can I get to the rest of these bullet points ? ”
89814	89821	89822	89822	Tag	308	“ Give it time , bro . ”
89867	89871	89872	89872	Eli	40	“ Next item , ”

90193	90199	90176	90176	October	207	“ freezing off her ass . ”

90285	90295	90296	90296	he	41	“ Have a seat . Out in a sec , ”
90418	90421	90422	90422	she	435	“ Hey , ”

90541	90548	90527	90527	He	1571	“ Yeah . Is it weird ? ”
90549	90555	90556	90556	God	43	“ Different , not weird . ”

90606	90612	90613	90613	He	1571	“ You said that already . ”
90646	90660	90641	90641	he	1571	“ Want to see how it feels and make your judgment call after ? ”
90661	90666	90678	90678	she	435	“ Mmm - hmm . ”
90822	90827	90828	90828	he	1571	“ What about dinner ? ”
90855	90865	90867	90867	he	1571	“ You sound like a good dinner to me . ”
90986	90989	90979	90979	his	1571	“ Isa . ”
91151	91154	91142	91142	she	435	“ Sable . ”

91516	91525	91504	91504	he	1571	“ I never imagined someone like you existed . ”

91596	91612	91582	91582	His	1571	“ I ’m going to make you come so hard I ’ll render you useless . ”
91630	91641	91642	91642	His	1571	“ Do you want that ? Me rendering you useless ? ”
91649	91672	91642	91642	His	1571	“ At my whim and command ? Shaking and pleading with me to stop because you ca n’t take any more pleasure ? ”
91682	91685	91687	91687	her	435	“ Yes , ”
91703	91706	91707	91707	He	1571	“ Good . ”

91877	91883	91863	91863	She	435	“ You owe me dinner . ”
91884	91893	91863	91863	She	435	“ It ’s in the oven . Lasagna . ”
91894	91899	91863	91863	She	435	“ You made lasagna ? ”
91990	91997	91998	91998	he	1571	“ I did not make lasagna , ”
92010	92017	91998	91998	he	1571	“ Benicia ’s Italiano made lasagna . “
92025	92025	91998	91998	he	1571	”
92026	92029	91998	91998	he	1571	“ Smart . ”
92030	92046	92047	92047	He	1571	“ Yeah , well , when you ’re a bachelor you learn a few tricks . ”
92089	92094	92095	92095	Isa	435	“ Was that eggplant ? ”
92112	92117	92118	92118	Eli	40	“ And portobello mushrooms , ”
92121	92129	92130	92130	She	435	“ Why do n’t you eat meat ? ”
92165	92168	92169	92169	he	1571	“ Truth ? ”
92172	92175	92155	92155	his	1571	“ Always . ”
92176	92183	92184	92184	He	1571	“ It ’s not dinner conversation . ”
92195	92202	92155	92155	his	1571	“ I have a strong stomach . ”
92203	92210	92211	92211	he	1571	“ You have a strong everything , ”
92243	92261	92262	92262	He	1571	“ After witnessing the mess left behind when I lost my foot and part of my leg … ”
92271	92290	92262	92262	He	1571	“ Well , without being too morbid , let ’s say my appetite for flesh went away instantly . ”
92291	92296	92299	92299	her	435	“ That makes sense . ”
92312	92323	92262	92262	He	1571	“ Yeah . Not manly , but there it is . ”
92324	92330	92331	92331	She	435	“ Trust me , Eli . ”
92355	92372	92347	92347	he	1571	“ No one would ever look at you and see you as ‘ not manly . ’ ”
92416	92425	92426	92426	he	1571	“ Now for the reason behind this celebration , ”
92487	92494	92495	92495	he	1571	“ Corporal Benjamin Hough , Junior , ”
92515	92528	92529	92529	Eli	40	“ Known as Benji to me and to his wife , Michelle . ”
92534	92569	92570	92570	Eli	40	“ He was the one who shoved me when Christopher dove on the grenade . He should n’t have died from the blast , but a piece of metal shot out like a dart . ”
92576	92581	92570	92570	Eli	40	“ Hit him here . ”
92608	92641	92642	92642	Eli	40	“ If that stray piece had n’t found his head , he would have been lying on the ground next to me missing a leg . Maybe two since he was closer . ”
92650	92662	92642	92642	Eli	40	“ We probably could have bitched our way through rehab together . ”
92669	92690	92663	92663	His	40	“ I went to see his wife and met her baby — one she and Benji had planned on adopting . ”
92691	92699	92663	92663	His	40	“ You did ? That ’s amazing . ”
92700	92761	92663	92663	His	40	“ It was . And it started me thinking about what I was doing with my life , whether I was living it to the fullest . I thought long and hard about what Benji would want . About what I would want for him if I was hoeing a row in heaven instead of down here on the pavement . ”
92790	92800	92801	92801	he	40	“ I do n’t want to have any regrets , ”
92808	92853	92801	92801	he	40	“ I have been holed up alone since I returned . I ’ve challenged everyone I ’ve come in contact with . With the exception of my family , you were the only one who challenged me back . The only one who stayed . ”
92915	92982	92908	92908	he	40	“ Isabella Sawyer . You asked me once if I believed I caused people pain . The answer was yes . But you let me off the hook . You said you were fine with me retreating , but you are n’t , are you ? You want me to live up to the promises I make . You push me to be a better man . ”
93024	93035	93036	93036	he	40	“ I ’m stepping in as COO at Crane Hotels , ”
93039	93051	93036	93036	he	40	“ The official announcement is happening at the Royale London event . ”
93073	93085	93086	93086	he	40	“ Good thing you already RSVPd yes for me , right ? ”
93130	93141	93142	93142	Eli	40	“ You were right to push me toward Crane Hotels , ”
93151	93181	93142	93142	Eli	40	“ You were right to encourage me to get involved . I ’m working hard to learn to go all in , and this gets me another step closer . ”
93225	93231	93232	93232	He	40	“ To you , Isa . ”
93240	93260	93232	93232	He	40	“ Thank you for helping me find where I belong . I could n’t have done it without you . ”
93295	93303	93306	93306	she	1580	“ Isa ? Are you all right ? ”
93338	93347	93348	93348	she	1580	“ Is this your way of being open ? ”
93361	93383	93351	93351	He	40	“ When I asked you to be open , I meant with your feelings , Eli , not your business plans . ”
93403	93424	93425	93425	She	1580	“ You know I do n’t make it a habit to mince words — or keep my opinions to myself . ”
93438	93443	93425	93425	She	1580	“ The truth is … ”
93470	93479	93480	93480	she	1580	“ I ’m falling for you , Eli , ”
93483	93499	93480	93480	she	1580	“ Hard . The kind of falling where you do n’t want to be saved . ”
93521	93598	93516	93516	she	1580	“ I want a future with you . I want to see who we can be when you ’re not holding back . I want to come home to you . Have dinner together and spend holidays together . I want to text and call and see you . I want you . All of you . Not just your body . And I definitely do n’t want you to withhold part of yourself from me . ”
93626	93634	93678	93678	he	40	“ I asked for time , Sable . ”
93635	93668	93678	93678	he	40	“ I know you did . I thought tonight you were ready to tell me how you felt about me . Not that you were going back to work for Crane Hotels . ”
93669	93677	93678	93678	he	40	“ I thought you ’d be happy , ”
93687	93695	93696	93696	she	1584	“ I am ! It ’s wonderful , ”
93727	93734	93704	93704	she	1584	“I thought there would be more . ”
93735	93738	93739	93739	he	40	“ More , ”
93742	93747	93704	93704	she	1584	“ Yes . More . ”
93748	93756	93758	93758	his	40	“ There is no ‘ more . ’ ”
93805	93815	93816	93816	he	1586	“ Crystal complained I could n’t go all in , ”
93819	93862	93816	93816	he	1586	“ She always said I ’m incapable of committing all the way . I want to . God knows I ’ve been trying . I ’ve been finishing my unfinished business with Refurbs , with Benji ’s widow , with Crane Hotels . ”
93873	93886	93867	93867	he	1586	“ Goddamn , Sable , I thought you ’d celebrate with me . ”
93887	93894	93895	93895	She	1586	“ I did ! I am ! ”
93916	93954	93895	93895	She	1586	“ This has nothing to do with Crystal . This has to do with us . Are you incapable of giving yourself to me before everything else in your life is tied in a neat little bow ? ”
93959	93965	93955	93955	His	1586	“ What if I am ? ”
93975	93985	93986	93986	he	1586	“ I asked for time because I need it , ”
93989	93996	93986	93986	he	1586	“ I thought we ’d agreed . ”
93997	94008	94011	94011	her	1586	“ And I thought you ’d see what we have . ”
94022	94028	94011	94011	her	1586	“ I have to go . ”
94029	94034	94042	94042	his	1586	“ Isa , wait . ”
94075	94082	94057	94057	she	1586	“ Wait ! Dammit , Sable . ”
94083	94088	94089	94089	she	1586	“ It ’s Isa , ”
94092	94101	94089	94089	she	1586	“ You ’re out of time , Eli . ”
94445	94451	94452	94452	he	41	“ Good morning , Bobbie , ”
94472	94479	94455	94455	She	228	“ Elijah . You look well . ”
94480	94485	94486	94487	Her son	1602	“ How is Derrick ? ”
94498	94504	94505	94505	Her	228	“ Home for the holidays . ”
94509	94515	94455	94455	She	228	“ That ’s good news . ”
94516	94545	94486	94487	Her son	1602	“ It ’s the best news . I ’m sorry about your injury , but I ’m glad you made it back alive . Derrick has lost friends . ”

The loss of your mother makes it more frightening to put ourselves on the line , our hearts on the line . Knowing that love could be snatched from you at any moment is a terrifying reality . For years , I closed myself off from the possibility of love . I was protecting my family — or so I thought . In reality , I believe I was protecting myself .

100873	100928	100838	100838	Alex	40	“ I ca n’t give her what she wants . How can I know what the future will bring , Dad ? How can I know I wo n’t wake up one day completely different ? What if I want to move to Montana to start raising cattle ? Where would that leave her ? ”
100929	100932	100933	100934	His father	244	“ Montana ? ”

101046	101067	101068	101068	Eli	40	“ How ’d you do it ? How ’d you lose Mom and not curl up and die with her ? ”
101113	101178	101179	101179	He	244	“ Because of you . And Tag . And Reese . Without you , I ’d have climbed into a bottle of scotch and never come out . Or maybe I would be living on Key West , picking up aluminum cans and muttering to myself . You boys gave me a reason to go on . Family does that . Women do that . ”
101184	101218	101179	101179	He	244	“ Why do you think I insisted on coming to these dinners ? I ’m not willing to let you become a loner , Eli . No good lies down that desolate path . ”
101234	101250	101251	101251	Alex	40	“ You ’re retreating . A good soldier knows when he ’s lost the battle , ”
101254	101277	101251	101251	Alex	40	“ But , son , your compass is showing false north . You have n’t lost . You have n’t even tried . ”

101474	101486	101487	101487	Alex	40	“ My tough guy . You always were my little soldier . ”
101593	101612	101587	101587	Alex	40	“ There now . Go get your girl . If you want her . Do you want her ? ”
101642	101652	101621	101621	he	40	“ She asked for space and I respect that . ”

102363	102366	102367	102367	she	50	“ Eli ? ”
102374	102384	102367	102367	she	50	“ Sent you a random assortment of designer clothes ? ”
102385	102391	102394	102394	she	50	“ They ’re not random . ”
102435	102451	102455	102455	Isa	435	“ I asked him to give me time and he ’s giving it to me . ”
102462	102494	102455	102455	Isa	435	“ He asked me for time , but I did n’t give it to him . I thought because I was in love with him he had to commit right away . ”
102528	102544	102514	102514	she	50	“ I behaved like a child . No . Worse . I behaved like Josh . ”
102596	102601	102602	102602	Isa	435	“ Oh , Chloe . ”

102661	102668	102653	102653	Isa	435	“ I made a big mistake . ”
102669	102681	102620	102620	Chloe	50	“ So what ? People make mistakes . You screwed up . ”
102696	102710	102653	102653	Isa	435	“ Are you afraid you ’ll screw up ? We all screw up . ”

I figured I can go to the Crane event tonight , but then I ’ll have to be out for a week or so . Is that okay ? I ’ll totally use my vacation time to do it . ”

102844	102852	102839	102839	Isa	435	“ No , it ’s not okay . ”
102853	102858	102859	102859	Chloe	50	“ It ’s not ? ”
102871	102910	102839	102839	Isa	435	“ I do n’t mean you going to Maryland — yes , go . Be with your family . But you can leave tonight if you want to , because I ’m going to the Crane event myself . ”
102976	102985	102986	102986	Isa	435	“ Going is the right thing to do , ”
103008	103027	102989	102989	She	750	“ Unless this was his way of evening the scales . Of returning what he took from me . ”

103076	103086	103028	103028	Chloe	50	“ I ’m afraid Eli still has my heart . ”
103097	103110	103087	103087	Chloe	50	“ I ’m not good at ducking out of my own life . ”
103111	103125	103126	103126	Chloe	50	“ I love when you get into Isa - kick - butt mode . ”
103137	103168	103126	103126	Chloe	50	“ Give me something to do . What can I help with ? Can I help you shop for shoes for tonight ? Do you need jewelry ? A dress ? ”
103169	103172	103173	103173	Isa	435	“ Actually … ”

103962	103998	103952	103952	She	228	“ Long story short ? Merina offered to help me pick out a gift for Isa , only I had it delivered instead of taking it myself . Merina told me I was too careful . ”

104147	104166	104128	104128	Eli	40	“ I do . Whatever we ’re nervous about losing is found in what we have been avoiding . ”

104460	104482	104455	104455	He	308	“ The not knowing , the uncertainty . The nausea . That feeling of fullness and lightness at the same time . ”
