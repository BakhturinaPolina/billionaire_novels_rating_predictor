806	838	764	764	Jolie	67	“ Several changes have been ordered for the Van Heusen in order to modernize it . Fingerprint entry is just one of them . Also , the elevators will be replaced . ”
839	842	843	843	Merina	2471	“ Why ? ”
896	927	928	928	She	67	“ Then there ’s the carpeting . The tapestry design wo n’t fit in with the new scheme . And probably the molding and ceiling medallions will all be replaced . ”
932	939	928	928	She	67	“ It ’s a new era . ”
940	950	951	951	Merina	2471	“ When did you take to day - drinking ? ”
978	1011	971	971	She	53	“ Sweetheart . We were going to tell you , but we wanted to make sure there really was no going back . I did n’t expect the locksmith to arrive today . ”
1024	1029	1019	1019	Merina	2471	“ Tell me what ? ”
1030	1084	971	971	She	53	“ Your father and I sold the Van Heusen to Alexander Crane six months ago . At the time , he had no plans on making any changes at all , but now that he ’s retiring , the hotel has fallen to his oldest son . Evidently , Reese had different ideas . ”
1127	1130	1122	1122	Alexander	69	“ Big Crane ”
1179	1186	1176	1176	her	2471	“ You sold the Van Heusen ? ”

1246	1256	1220	1220	Merina	2471	“ Why did n’t you talk to me first ? ”
1257	1272	1273	1273	Jolie	67	“ You know we ’d never include you in our financial difficulties , Merina . ”
1281	1288	1289	1290	her mom	53	“ Bankruptcy was not an option , ”
1293	1314	1289	1290	her mom	53	“ Plus , selling gave us the best of both worlds . No financial responsibility and we keep our jobs . ”
1315	1323	1324	1324	Her	67	“ With Reese Crane as your boss ! ”
1346	1348	1336	1336	They	322	“No . ”

2555	2560	2561	2561	Merina	2471	“ You ca n’t , ”
2575	2584	2561	2561	Merina	2471	“ I need to speak with Mr. Crane . ”
2585	2592	2561	2561	Merina	2471	“ Do you have an appoin — ”
2593	2596	2597	2597	She	377	“ No . ”

2754	2768	2735	2736	the woman	377	“ You ’re here regarding the changes to the hotel , I presume . ”
2769	2774	2775	2775	Merina	2471	“ You got it , ”
2796	2801	2802	2802	Crane	377	“ Have a seat . ”
2830	2840	2823	2823	she	377	“ Perhaps I could fetch you a towel first . ”
2841	2848	2849	2849	She	377	“ I wo n’t be sitting . ”
2900	2904	2889	2889	Merina	2471	“ Excuse me ! ”
3033	3038	3046	3046	Reese	377	“ Ms. Van Heusen ! ”
3068	3075	3046	3046	Reese	377	“ She ’s fine , Bobbie . ”
3097	3103	3104	3104	Reese	377	“ Merina , I presume . ”
3414	3425	3426	3426	he	377	“ Seems this April morning is colder than you anticipated , ”
3461	3468	3469	3469	she	382	“ Cut the horseshit , Crane , ”
3502	3508	3509	3509	she	382	“ I heard some news , ”
3517	3525	3526	3526	she	382	“ Your father purchased the Van Heusen , ”
3529	3540	3541	3541	he	377	“ He added it to the family portfolio , yes , ”
3586	3614	3615	3615	She	382	“ There ’s been an error . My mother is under the impression that many of the nostalgic and antique fixtures in the building will be replaced . ”
3673	3678	3679	3679	He	377	“ Have a seat . ”
3775	3789	3761	3761	Reese	377	“ Bobbie , Ms. Van Heusen will need a car in fifteen minutes . ”
3790	3795	3761	3761	Reese	377	“ Yes , sir . ”

3820	3830	3834	3834	he	377	“ No ? You ’re planning on walking back ? ”
3863	3866	3867	3867	She	2471	“ Yes . ”
3926	3934	3935	3935	he	377	“ You were saying something about horseshit , ”
3971	4020	3957	3957	She	2471	“ You ca n’t redesign the Van Heusen Hotel . It ’s a landmark . Did you know the hotel was the first to install elevators ? The hotel ’s chef created the snickerdoodle . That building is an integral thread woven into the fabric of this city . ”
4095	4117	4118	4118	he	388	“ Born and raised in Chicago , Ms. Van Heusen . You ’re not telling me anything I do n’t know , ”
4124	4136	4137	4137	she	2471	“ Then you know remodeling the Van Heusen makes no sense , ”
4147	4169	4137	4137	she	2471	“ Our hotel is known for its style . Guests come there to experience a living , breathing piece of Chicago . ”
4193	4201	4202	4202	he	388	“ My hotel , Ms. Van Heusen , ”
4284	4314	4315	4315	she	2471	“ No matter who owns the building , you have to know that robbing the Van Heusen of its style will make it just another whitewashed , dull hotel , ”
4403	4410	4391	4391	She	2471	“ Surely there ’s another way . ”
4423	4436	4419	4419	he	388	“ Your parents have been in the red for nearly two years . ”
4447	4456	4457	4457	he	388	“ I gather this is news to you , ”
4463	4475	4457	4457	he	388	“ Your father ’s hospital bills put them further in debt . ”
4513	4526	4527	4527	Reese	377	“ They came to us to buy the building and we did , ”
4530	4556	4527	4527	Reese	377	“ I could have fired them , but I did n’t . I offered a generous pension plan if they stayed on through the remodel . ”
4571	4582	4527	4527	Reese	377	“ I take it you did n’t know that either . ”
4583	4592	4593	4593	she	2471	“ They did n’t want to worry me , ”
4658	4669	4670	4670	she	2471	“ They trusted your father to take care of them , ”
4678	4688	4670	4670	she	2471	“ Then you waltz in and wipe them out . ”
4689	4707	4708	4708	Satan	81	“ My father likes your parents , but this is n’t about what nice people they are , ”
4711	4729	4708	4708	Satan	81	“ He mentioned how well they ’d maintained the local landmark with what funds they had available . ”
4776	4784	4785	4785	she	2471	“ Your father is a wise man , ”
4810	4834	4805	4805	Reese	377	“ I doubt his intention when he purchased the Van Heusen was to turn it into a mini - me of the Crane . ”
4835	4861	4862	4862	Reese	377	“ My father is retiring in a few months . He ’s made it clear the future of the Van Heusen is in my hands . ”
4876	4902	4862	4862	Reese	377	“ I fail to see the charm in the funky , run - down boutique hotel , and I assume most visitors do as well . ”
4916	4930	4931	4931	she	2471	“ Do you know how many Hollywood actors have dined in our restaurant ? ”
4934	4950	4931	4931	she	2471	“ Hemingway wrote part of his memoir sitting on the velvet chair in the lobby ! ”
4951	4961	4913	4913	he	401	“ I thought he mostly wrote in Key West . ”
4962	4965	4966	4966	she	2471	“ Rumors , ”
5008	5016	5017	5017	he	401	“ You have outdated heating and air , ”
5020	5056	5017	5017	he	401	“ elevators that are so close to violating safety codes , you may as well install ladders for the guests on the upper floors , and the wood putty is n’t fooling anyone , Merina . ”
5117	5126	5105	5105	She	2471	“ The elevators are original to the building . ”
5127	5131	5132	5132	He	401	“ It shows . ”
5138	5179	5132	5132	He	401	“ The Van Heusen is stodgy and outdated , and revenue is falling more each quarter . I ’m doing your parents a favor by offering them a way out of what will be nothing but a future of headaches . ”
5223	5266	5267	5267	He	401	“ The Crane branding is strong , our business plan seamless . If you love the building as much as you claim to , you ’d support the efforts to increase the traffic . We ’ll see profits double with an upgrade . ”
5272	5286	5267	5267	He	401	“ But not with your parents there . And not with you there . ”
5313	5320	5310	5310	he	401	“ You’re … firing … me ? ”
5326	5339	5340	5340	She	377	“ My family ’s goddamn name is on the marquee , Crane ! ”
5374	5385	5386	5386	he	401	“ Your family ’s name will remain on the building , ”
5415	5442	5412	5412	he	401	“ Your parents are getting close to retirement age . Are you sure you swam over here on their behalf ? Or is this about you ? ”
5443	5450	5451	5451	she	377	“ Of course I ’m sure , ”
5526	5557	5558	5558	Reese	377	“ Think about it , Merina . What I ’m offering is more than retirement , and at their age I ’m sure they do n’t want to find work , ”
5561	5572	5558	5558	Reese	377	“ Running the Van Heusen is all they ’ve known . ”
5695	5707	5692	5692	Bobbie	162	“ Ms. Van Heusen ’s town car is here , sir . ”
5708	5715	5716	5716	Merina	2471	“ I do n’t want it , ”
5743	5746	5734	5734	they	290	“ Very well ”
5816	5835	5836	5836	Reese	377	“ I have an appointment I ca n’t miss , but I wo n’t leave you in suspense . ”
5887	5890	5891	5891	she	2471	“ Suspense ? ”
5924	5940	5941	5941	His	162	“ I ’m not going to put you out on your fantastic ass , Merina . ”
6080	6093	6095	6095	she	2471	“ I appreciate your reconsidering . I belong at the Van Heusen . ”
6125	6139	6140	6140	he	162	“ No , you misunderstand me . I ca n’t keep you there , ”
6151	6195	6140	6140	he	162	“ But I can offer you almost any position you ’d like at Crane Hotels . We have openings in Wisconsin , Virginia , and Ohio . I know it ’s not Chicago , but chances are you can stay in the Midwest . ”
6351	6362	6364	6364	their	419	“ You listen to me , you suited sewer rat . ”
6375	6413	6369	6369	she	377	“ I ’m going to find a way around your machinations and when I do , I ’m going to march back in here with the contract my parents signed and shove it straight up your ass . ”
6450	6472	6431	6431	he	417	“ You ’ll have to forgive Ms. Van Heusen . She does n’t like when she does n’t get her way . ”
6492	6499	6485	6485	Reese	377	“ Will there be anything else ? ”
6500	6507	6513	6513	she	2471	“ Your head on a pike . ”
6639	6648	6649	6649	Reese	377	“ That meeting went as well as expected , ”
6652	6659	6649	6649	Reese	377	“ Bunch of stodgy old placeholders . ”

7292	7297	7298	7298	Reese	377	“ She left incensed , ”
7301	7321	7298	7298	Reese	377	“ Stormed out of my office fifteen minutes later but not before insulting me in front of Phil Lightman . ”

13799	13842	13784	13784	He	572	“ Oh , right . Like a million somebodies . Tell me why you ’re allergic to seeing a woman more than once . Is it because they find out how lousy you are in bed and then run for the hills ? ”
13853	13873	13848	13848	he	572	“ It ’s because I never call them again and instruct my secretary to send flowers stating as much . ”
13941	13952	13953	13953	she	2471	“ What about the woman I saw leaving your office ? ”

14125	14229	14120	14120	Reese	377	“ It will be a simple affair at my house . My brother and father will be there , a justice of the peace , and a few members of the Crane Holdings board . Keep your invitations essential . Your parents , a best friend , a few close family members . We need to keep this small . You ca n’t tell your family you ’re marrying for show . There is too big of a chance the truth will come out . I ’ll have a photographer there who will feed a few pictures to the media for publicity purposes . ”
14408	14427	14428	14428	he	81	“ It has to appear real , so I ’ve handed the details over to my PR specialist , ”

23965	23974	23954	23954	He	768	“ Or rather , left to each other . ”
24015	24026	24027	24027	she	2471	“ I hear this restaurant is known for its aphrodisiacs , ”
24042	24051	24052	24052	he	768	“ Chocolate . Watermelon . Oysters . Avocado , ”
24055	24061	24062	24062	Her	2471	“ Watermelon is an aphrodisiac ? ”
24067	24077	24062	24062	Her	2471	“ If you believe in that sort of thing . ”
24078	24083	24084	24084	She	2471	“ You do n’t ? ”
24159	24162	24163	24163	he	768	“ No , ”
24166	24171	24163	24163	he	768	“ I do n’t . ”
24172	24180	24181	24181	she	2471	“ Well , that ’s no fun , ”
24194	24206	24181	24181	she	2471	“ I mean , not that I expect … never mind . ”
24278	24291	24292	24293	the waiter	766	“ Pan - seared mochi with avocado and a yuzu sesame dressing , ”
24296	24303	24304	24304	Merina	2471	“ Wow . This is adorable , ”
24332	24336	24337	24337	He	768	“ Good too . ”
24425	24434	24435	24435	she	2471	“ Did you know you have a hashtag ? ”
24445	24450	24451	24451	he	768	“ Not you too , ”
24465	24473	24474	24474	he	768	“ I know I have a hashtag , ”
24490	24498	24499	24499	she	2471	“ Do you know who started it ? ”
24502	24509	24551	24551	She	2471	“ I have a good idea . ”
24510	24519	24551	24551	She	2471	“ Well , at least it ’s flattering . ”
24520	24527	24528	24528	he	768	“ If you find objectification flattering , ”
24531	24544	24545	24545	He	768	“ Would you like it if someone gave a hashtag to your … ”
24561	24580	24551	24551	She	2471	“ Hmm . Fair point . I thought men liked to be told how large their penises are . ”
24609	24617	24551	24551	She	2471	“ See ? You do like it . ”
24618	24625	24551	24551	She	2471	“ I ’m attached to it . ”
24707	24714	24715	24715	she	2471	“ You have a lighter side , ”
24718	24722	24715	24715	she	2471	“ Who knew ? ”
24723	24735	24715	24715	she	2471	“ Do n’t tell anyone . You ’ll ruin my reputation . ”
24789	24793	24794	24794	she	2471	“ That woman , ”
24802	24807	24794	24794	she	2471	“ Friend of yours ? ”
24808	24811	24812	24813	His friends	2289	“ No . ”
24821	24823	24812	24813	His friends	2289	“ friends ”
24860	24868	24869	24869	Merina	2471	“ But you did sleep with her , ”
24872	24881	24869	24869	Merina	2471	“ I do n’t sleep with my friends . ”
24882	24886	24887	24887	She	2471	“ Only strangers ? ”
24921	24930	24959	24959	She	2471	“ Who do you sleep with , Merina ? ”
24931	24935	24939	24939	her	2471	“ Excuse me ? ”
24942	24948	24949	24949	He	780	“ You brought it up . ”
24953	24958	24949	24949	He	780	“ Just making conversation . ”
24971	24987	24959	24959	She	2471	“ I should n’t have , I suppose . I find your love life fascinating . ”
24988	25001	25002	25002	He	780	“ You , the media , and Crane Holdings board of directors . ”
25040	25051	25002	25002	He	780	“ I do n’t understand . What ’s the draw ? ”
25052	25089	25093	25093	his	780	“ Are you kidding ? A wealthy man who dates a parade of beautiful women , yet none of them can penetrate his cold , unfeeling heart ? The public eats that sort of thing up . ”
25138	25162	25163	25163	she	781	“ I was surprised to learn you had such an aversion to the media since you ’ve played into their hands so nicely , ”
25166	25187	25188	25188	His	780	“ Just because this city is fascinated with the details of my dates does n’t mean I have to pander . ”
25220	25230	25235	25235	her	781	“ They ’ll also be fascinated with our lives . ”
25238	25267	25235	25235	her	781	“ We ’re going to be husband and wife . There are things we should talk about . How we met . First date . First time we … ”
25291	25300	25301	25301	she	781	“ … learned each other ’s middle names , ”
25320	25352	25301	25301	she	781	“ Merina , this is our first date . The rest of it we wo n’t have talked about because the public will assume all we ’ve been doing is fucking . ”
25392	25424	25360	25360	she	781	“ I ’ve been in the spotlight enough to know that the media assumes I ’m sleeping with the women they photograph me with . They ’re right half the time . ”
25425	25429	25430	25430	Merina	2471	“ Only half ? ”
25434	25441	25442	25442	he	780	“ Seventy percent of the time , ”
25518	25530	25531	25531	he	780	“ The fewer things we have to make up the better , ”
25534	25563	25531	25531	he	780	“ How did we meet ? You stormed into my office to demand I keep the Van Heusen as - is . Then you gave me a doorknob . ”
25573	25583	25567	25567	She	2471	“ Which I need back , by the way . ”
25589	25607	25567	25567	She	2471	“ Wo n’t the public suspect something when I end up with the hotel in my name ? ”
25608	25616	25617	25617	He	780	“ By then it wo n’t matter . ”
25620	25639	25617	25617	He	780	“ The divorce will garner some attention , but will be buried the next day beneath celebrity hoopla . ”
25640	25651	25652	25652	Her	2471	“ Or the next woman you take to an opera . ”
25693	25705	25706	25706	he	780	“ Attention for the Van Heusen is n’t a bad thing , ”
25714	25746	25706	25706	he	780	“ An article will win you some much needed publicity for the hotel . Mention how charming or quaint or rustic it is . Whatever turns you on about the place . ”
25747	25758	25759	25759	Her	2471	“ You really do hate it , do n’t you ? ”
25804	25811	25812	25812	he	780	“ I do n’t hate it , ”
25820	25832	25812	25812	he	780	“ But why choose a homey hotel over a sleek one ? ”
25833	25848	25878	25878	they	789	“ Seriously ? Who would n’t want a relaxing , warm , family atmosphere ? ”
25849	25860	25861	25861	he	780	“ Anyone who is trying to work or get laid , ”
25865	25875	25878	25878	they	789	“ I ’m not running a brothel , Crane . ”
25882	25885	25878	25878	they	789	“ Crane . ”
25886	25898	25899	25899	Their	789	“ Well , I ’m not running an orphanage , Merina . ”
25910	25949	25903	25903	He	780	“ But there are people who see the world the way you do . When you talk to the media , keep your focus on your passion for the hotel . You ’ll draw in those bleeding hearts . ”
25989	25994	25986	25986	Merina	2471	“ This looks disgusting . ”
25995	26003	26004	26004	he	780	“ It tastes worse than it looks , ”
26011	26018	26019	26019	She	2471	“ You do n’t like it ? ”
26035	26042	26043	26043	he	780	“ I do not like it , ”
26046	26051	26052	26052	She	2471	“ Sam I Am ? ”
26059	26068	26052	26052	She	2471	“ Would you eat it in a box ? ”
26077	26082	26069	26069	Reese	377	“ Dr. Seuss fan ? ”
26083	26097	26098	26098	She	2471	“ Green Eggs and Ham is the best children ’s book ever written . ”
26114	26120	26121	26121	he	780	“ On this we agree , ”
26132	26144	26145	26145	She	2471	“ I still have my copy from when I was little . ”
26162	26189	26199	26199	he	780	“ Me too . My mom used to read it to me before bed . I ca n’t look at that tattered spine without remembering her . ”
26246	26252	26253	26253	Sincerity	142	“ Your mom has passed ? ”
26259	26267	26268	26268	He	780	“ A long time ago . Anyway . ”
26286	26300	26301	26301	she	2471	“ There ’s a gap in our how - we - met story , ”
26309	26330	26301	26301	she	2471	“ What will we say happened between the moment I stormed into your office and , say , right now ? ”
26331	26349	26301	26301	she	2471	“ The truth . I showed up at the Van Heusen in the middle of the night . ”
26350	26354	26355	26355	she	2471	“ Because … ? ”
26358	26367	26301	26301	she	2471	“ I could n’t stop thinking about you . ”
26376	26380	26381	26381	he	780	“ Your passion , ”
26385	26393	26381	26381	he	780	“ We ’ll say I was smitten . ”
26394	26397	26398	26398	she	2471	“ Smitten , ”
26401	26404	26405	26405	He	780	“ Completely . ”
26503	26514	26515	26515	he	780	“ There are a few details we should discuss tonight , ”
26522	26536	26515	26515	he	780	“ We need to coordinate our schedules . Do you have an assistant ? ”
26537	26542	26543	26543	She	2471	“ Are you joking ? ”
26569	26584	26562	26562	her	2471	“ Am I joking about what ? And how could you possibly like that ? ”
26585	26595	26596	26596	she	2471	“ Are you joking about me having an assistant , ”
26608	26623	26596	26596	she	2471	“ What ’s not to like ? It ’s watermelon . It ’s refreshing . ”
26624	26641	26562	26562	her	2471	“ You should n’t have to drink watermelon . Why do n’t you have an assistant ? ”
26642	26651	26596	26596	she	2471	“ Because I like to do everything myself . ”
26671	26682	26683	26683	He	795	“ Very well , I ’ll send you my schedule . ”
26689	26692	26683	26683	He	795	“ Now ? ”
26693	26697	26698	26698	They	793	“ Why not ? ”
26717	26720	26721	26721	She	2471	“ Okay . ”
26751	26764	26733	26733	He	795	“ It ’s Harrington , by the way . My middle name . ”
26769	26772	26765	26765	Her	2471	“ Nicole . ”
26773	26784	26733	26733	He	795	“ Okay , Merina Nicole Van Heusen . Shall we ? ”

26951	26963	26964	26964	he	797	“ You ’ll need to cancel drinks with Lorelei on Tuesday , ”
26970	26984	26964	26964	he	797	“ Forget it . I have n’t gone out with her in ages . ”
26985	26989	26990	26990	he	797	“ New fiancé , ”
26997	27006	26990	26990	he	797	“ Whirlwind romance . Wedding in two weeks . ”
27038	27043	27044	27044	he	797	“ Forgot about her , ”
27057	27070	27095	27095	she	2471	“ Let me guess ? Are you having Bobbie send her flowers ? ”
27071	27091	27095	27095	she	2471	“ No . No date , no flowers . I sent Bobbie a note to cancel and not reschedule . ”
27309	27315	27305	27305	Merina	2471	“ Bobbie really hates me . ”
27316	27323	27324	27324	He	806	“ No , she does n’t . ”
27342	27351	27324	27324	He	806	“ She ’s too busy to be cordial . ”
27352	27356	27357	27357	She	2471	“ Like you ? ”
27361	27365	27366	27366	He	806	“ Very funny . ”
27427	27437	27438	27438	Merina	2471	“ Looks like she did n’t appreciate your flowers , ”
27465	27473	27449	27449	He	806	“ No . This is our advisor . ”
27489	27505	27481	27481	He	806	“ Penelope Brand , I ’d like you to meet Merina Van Heusen , my — ”
27506	27512	27513	27513	Penelope	121	“ What were you thinking ? ”
27547	27574	27540	27540	Penelope	121	“ You went on your first date in public and not only did you not kiss each other good night , you barely touched each other ! ”
27598	27608	27609	27609	he	816	“ I ’m sure we can work this out , ”
27615	27622	27609	27609	he	816	“ Merina , have a seat . ”
27636	27645	27646	27646	Penelope	121	“ That ’s what I ’m talking about , ”
27649	27663	27646	27646	Penelope	121	“ You just directed your fiancée into her seat with a chin nod . ”
27674	27707	27664	27664	She	121	“ We ca n’t announce the engagement on the heels of this disaster . I ’m going to have to put some spin on your impromptu outing last night to fix this . ”
27727	27759	27713	27713	Penelope	121	“ ‘ Reese Crane hit the town with his mystery date , but what started hot quickly moved to tepid as the two stared at their phones over sexy entrées . ’ ”
27773	27870	27760	27760	She	121	“ ‘ He and the woman in the red dress shared feisty looks and tantalizing smiles before the evening took on a different tone : one of business as they pecked at their iThings . The scene was set with champagne and caviar , but the aphrodisiacs at Chicago ’s famed Armande restaurant had no effect on these two office drones . Is Crane ’s tame date made to distract from the sizable issue of his hashtag ? Or is this the one woman in existence who did n’t fall at King Crane ’s feet ? ’ ”
27876	27882	27883	27883	Reese	377	“ What paper is that ? ”
27901	27925	27926	27926	Penelope	121	“ It ’s the Chicago Insider — a blog . And it ’s already been shared across social media about two hundred times . ”
27956	27984	27938	27938	Her	121	“ The point is , they already smell a rat , and people are paying attention . You two are going to have to up your game . ”
27985	27998	27999	27999	Merina	2471	“ We coordinated our calendars . We ’re on the same page , ”
28012	28039	27999	27999	Merina	2471	“ A few more dates and I ’m sure the public will see us as a couple . This is just new . They ’re speculating , ”
28066	28126	28046	28046	She	121	“ Merina . You ’re a vibrant , beautiful woman . You ’re in love with a gorgeous , hunky billionaire . You were at a restaurant that served everything but sex on those plates . The reporter who happened to be there expected to see Reese and a mystery woman all but fornicate on top of the table . ”
28130	28141	28127	28127	Merina	2471	“ You two walked in sort of cozy according to this reporter”—Penelope
28152	28171	28127	28127	Merina	2471	table—“but you left single file . Reese , you did n’t so much as palm her lower back . ”
28172	28177	28178	28178	Merina	2471	“ He did so , ”
28181	28197	28198	28198	She	2471	“ On the way to our table , he placed his palm on my back . ”
28226	28264	28212	28212	She	2471	“ Regardless . Whatever you did was n’t enough to leave an impression on Rose Wells of the Chicago Insider . You two have to do better . The only opinion that matters is the public one . ”
28265	28270	28271	28271	Reese	377	“ So we pander , ”
28290	28312	28271	28271	Reese	377	“ You hired me to help you convince the world your cold heart has been thawed by a smoking hot romance . ”
28389	28399	28400	28400	Penelope	121	“ Last night showed how unprepared you two are . ”
28411	28415	28400	28400	Penelope	121	“ Kiss her . ”
28416	28419	28420	28420	His	820	“ What ? ”
28432	28444	28445	28445	Penelope	121	“ I want to see if you can pull it off . ”
28448	28458	28400	28400	Penelope	121	“ I ’m not a performing monkey , Pen . ”
28459	28466	28467	28467	Merina	2471	“ We can pull it off , ”
28523	28559	28519	28519	Penelope	121	“ Good . In that case , let ’s review your revised schedule of events , because you two are going to need to sell it . And after the next date , if this happens again”—she
28562	28584	28519	28519	Penelope	121	phone—“we will have to reconvene and you will be practicing your PDA for me . Because right now it ’s PDB . ”
28601	28604	28605	28605	Merina	2471	“ PDB ? ”
28622	28628	28608	28608	Penelope	121	“ Public displays of boredom . ”
28632	28637	28638	28638	Merina	2471	“ She ’s intense , ”
28662	28691	28698	28698	his	826	“ She ’s the best . And she ’s trustworthy . She is n’t going to run to the papers and sell this story for the highest price . ”
28701	28706	28698	28698	his	826	“ She hates reporters . ”
28741	28747	28748	28748	Merina	2471	“ She ’s also right , ”
28751	28754	28755	28755	Reese	377	“ Yeah , ”
28758	28764	28765	28765	She	2471	“ Maybe we should practice . ”
28777	28787	28765	28765	She	2471	“ So that we ’re comfortable around each other . ”
28868	28882	28883	28883	She	2471	“ I do n’t have as much experience wooing strangers as you do . ”
28889	28905	28883	28883	She	2471	“ I do n’t mean to say I do n’t know what I ’m doing . ”
28906	28919	28920	28920	He	832	“ It ’s okay , Merina , I know what you mean . ”
28944	28950	28933	28933	His	832	“ What do you suggest ? ”
29003	29010	28972	28972	she	2471	“ How about another date tonight ? ”
29011	29020	28972	28972	she	2471	“ Fine . I ’ll call Tableau and — ”
29021	29029	29031	29031	she	2471	“ No . Not another fancy dinner . ”
29035	29038	29031	29031	she	2471	“ Posh . ”
29039	29044	28972	28972	she	2471	“ The martini bar ? ”
29045	29056	29065	29065	hers	2471	“ Yeah . We can have drinks and practice there . ”
29067	29070	28972	28972	she	2471	“ Seven . ”
29071	29078	29079	29079	she	2471	“ Seven . And , Reese ? ”
29091	29104	29079	29079	she	2471	“ If you pick me up yourself , that may be better . ”
29192	29196	29197	29197	he	832	“ Just practicing , ”
29315	29323	29306	29306	Merina	2471	“ What are you two doing here ? ”
29324	29346	29347	29348	her mother	2182	“ Like I said , if we would have gone to Fields , we could have saved twenty minutes getting back , ”
29361	29387	29388	29388	He	411	“ And like I said , if we would have gone to the Olive Garden , we would n’t be arguing about this at all . ”
29398	29410	29411	29412	her mother	2182	“ We ’re cooking because we both want to be healthy , ”
29420	29432	29411	29412	her mother	2182	“ And there ’s no ‘ the ’ in Olive Garden . ”
29433	29449	29450	29450	Mark	102	“ Your mother wants to be healthy . I want to eat at a restaurant . ”
29463	29478	29479	29479	Reese	377	“ I mean what are you doing home ? I thought you were working . ”
29517	29530	29531	29532	Her mother	53	“ We ’re fully staffed if that ’s what you ’re asking . ”
29537	29542	29531	29532	Her mother	53	“ You look beautiful . ”
29543	29546	29557	29557	Reese	377	“ Thanks . ”
29603	29607	29608	29608	she	2471	“ Be nice , ”
29618	29624	29625	29625	He	411	“ I ’m an angel . ”
29754	29757	29758	29758	She	377	“ Hi . ”
29791	29796	29797	29797	He	411	“ Hey , gorgeous . ”
29864	29874	29854	29854	we	851	“ Mom , Dad , you know Reese Crane . ”
29894	29898	29899	29899	she	377	“ Mr. Crane , ”
29902	29907	29899	29899	she	377	“ What a surprise . ”
29908	29914	29915	29915	Merina	2471	“ We ’ll be back , ”
29931	29934	29935	29935	Reese	377	“ Maybe , ”
29954	29961	29962	29962	he	411	“ Drinks may turn into dinner , ”
29969	29973	29962	29962	he	411	“ And dessert . ”
29983	29988	29989	29989	she	377	“ He ’s kidding , ”
30019	30048	30016	30016	he	411	“ Mr. and Mrs. Van Heusen , good to see you . I assume Merina told you the remodel and staffing plans have been put on indefinite hold . ”
30049	30052	30053	30054	her father	411	“ Hold ? ”
30068	30075	30053	30054	her father	411	“ She did n’t tell us . ”
30076	30086	30016	30016	he	411	“ Right now we ’re focused on another building . ”
30087	30090	30091	30091	Jolie	67	“ Indefinite ? ”
30094	30100	30091	30091	Jolie	67	“ That’s … interesting news . ”
30101	30104	30105	30105	Merina	2471	“ Wonderful , ”
30108	30114	30105	30105	Merina	2471	“ It ’s wonderful news . ”
30115	30131	30132	30132	He	411	“ Merina came to my office and made a compelling argument about the Van Heusen . ”
30165	30180	30159	30159	he	411	“ I stood very corrected . She ’s a force to be reckoned with . ”
30181	30186	30187	30188	Her father	411	“ That she is . ”
30248	30257	30285	30285	He	411	“ I did n’t know Posh took reservations . ”
30258	30264	30265	30265	Reese	377	“ For the upper deck , ”
30351	30366	30345	30345	Merina	2471	“ Nice effort with the parents . Who knew you could be so smooth ? ”
30367	30382	30383	30383	He	411	“ Us sewer rats are able to call up sophistication when we need to . ”
30397	30408	30409	30409	She	2471	“ And that bit about dinner and dessert . Risky . ”
30436	30443	30444	30444	he	411	“ Padding the announcement for you , ”
30447	30466	30444	30444	he	411	“ When you tell them about our engagement , they ’ll have to believe we were swept up . ”
30608	30624	30590	30590	he	867	“ I meant it was risky because you implied I might not make it home . ”
30625	30634	30590	30590	he	867	“ Well it could be a long evening . ”
30742	30749	30735	30735	he	867	“ What are you smiling about ? ”
30750	30753	30754	30754	He	867	“ Nothing . ”
30971	30974	30975	30975	he	867	“ Darling , ”
31248	31264	31265	31265	Merina	2471	“ Downstairs , getting to the bartender is a test of endurance and Midwest manners , ”
31290	31304	31269	31269	she	2471	“ You could learn a thing or two from the people down there . ”
31305	31313	31314	31314	His	880	“ That ’s why I have you . ”
31388	31395	31378	31378	He	791	“ Anything else , beautiful people ? ”
31396	31403	31404	31404	Merina	2471	“ No , thanks , Kevin . ”
31415	31421	31404	31404	Merina	2471	“ You bet , Mer . ”
31440	31448	31404	31404	Merina	2471	“ How ’s your stereotypically feminine cocktail ? ”
31455	31466	31467	31467	He	791	“ Fruity . How ’s your exhaustingly cliché manly drink ? ”
31496	31504	31505	31505	he	791	“ It ’s always what I expect , ”
31519	31535	31511	31511	He	791	“ Yours is to the discretion and capabilities of the bartender . Mine never wavers . ”
31536	31547	31548	31548	She	2471	“ Do you enjoy getting what you expect , Crane ? ”
31553	31560	31548	31548	She	2471	“ The expected can be boring . ”
31618	31624	31625	31625	he	791	“ Reliability is n’t boring , ”
31649	31653	31654	31654	she	2471	“ Structured childhood ? ”
31665	31695	31657	31657	He	791	“ Yes and no . Dad is ex - military , so he has a side of him that is structured . Mom was more of a free spirit . ”
31742	31745	31746	31746	He	791	“ You ? ”
31774	31809	31746	31746	He	791	“ My parents are traditional . They believe in working hard , but they also know money is a tool to provide comfort , not the end - all be - all of existence . ”
31810	31825	31843	31843	his	791	“ Do you think my family worships at the altar of the almighty dollar ? ”
31826	31832	31833	31833	she	2471	“ Not … on purpose , ”
31965	31973	31974	31974	Reese	377	“ Parents are out of the way , ”
31977	31993	31974	31974	Reese	377	“ What do you want to share next ? Schooling ? Favorite color ? Hobbies ? ”
31994	32000	32001	32001	She	2471	“ That ’s pretty dry . ”
32162	32173	32174	32174	she	2471	“ What about the emotional hurtles we have to leap ? ”
32177	32188	32174	32174	she	2471	“ You ’re a good two feet away from me . ”
32189	32195	32196	32196	he	899	“ Maybe I ’m shy , ”
32208	32210	32196	32196	he	899	“ Or maybe”—he
32224	32232	32196	32196	he	899	hers—“I’m worried I ’ll frighten you away . ”
32271	32278	32279	32279	Her	2471	“ I do n’t spook easily . ”
32283	32286	32287	32287	He	899	“ No ? ”
32403	32409	32399	32399	Reese	377	“ We ’ve been made . ”
32421	32424	32425	32425	he	899	“ Reporter , ”
32507	32510	32488	32488	he	899	“ Showtime . ”
32528	32538	32539	32539	He	899	“ First kiss . Do n’t screw it up . ”
32687	32691	32692	32692	he	899	“ Not bad , ”
32749	32762	32744	32744	He	899	“ We ’ll discuss timing on the engagement announcement at dinner tonight . ”
32763	32766	32767	32767	She	377	“ Dinner ? ”
32770	32774	32744	32744	He	899	“ And dessert . ”
32775	32778	32779	32779	She	377	“ Dessert ? ”
32794	32805	32806	32806	He	899	“ Though I ’m tempted to have my dessert now . ”
32856	32859	32860	32860	she	377	“ Okay , ”
32871	32876	32860	32860	she	377	“ Dinner and dessert . ”
33139	33141	33137	33137	Merina	2471	“ more ”
33240	33244	33245	33245	Merina	2471	“ Oh God , ”
33248	33251	33252	33252	He	899	“ What ? ”
33267	33273	33245	33245	Merina	2471	“ You dated her too . ”
33274	33277	33279	33279	she	2471	“ What ? ”
33332	33339	33320	33321	his father	430	“ Why would you say that ? ”
33353	33372	33373	33373	She	377	“ How am I going to keep up with your long , long , long list of ladies ? ”
33388	33419	33381	33381	his	899	“ If I were the one sleeping with half the men in the city , I would be painted as the slutty girl and they ’d say you were slumming . ”
33420	33423	33424	33424	He	899	“ Merina . ”
33445	33460	33436	33436	he	899	“ No one in their right mind would ever accuse you of being slutty . ”
33491	33495	33496	33496	She	377	“ Wanna bet ? ”
33528	33537	33496	33496	She	377	“ Sure . I have a few bucks . ”
33538	33565	33571	33571	She	377	“ I ca n’t shake your hand because we ’d look too businessy , so I had to improvise and go with a tie - tug . ”
33566	33570	33496	33496	She	377	“ Good thinking . ”
33595	33612	33613	33613	she	377	“ Five dollars says I ’m painted as one of your ninnies by night ’s end , ”
33616	33621	33613	33613	she	377	“ You ’re on . ”
33622	33630	33633	33633	she	377	“ You ’re going down , Crane , ”
33746	33748	33742	33742	he	899	“ tame ”
33764	33772	33773	33774	her mother	320	“ Well , you ’re smiley today , ”
33786	33791	33773	33774	her mother	320	“ And up early . ”
33808	33810	33792	33792	Merina	2471	“ dates ”
33817	33830	33831	33831	Jolie	67	“ I noticed you were home early from your date last Friday . ”
33839	33842	33831	33831	Jolie	67	“ Warmer ? ”
33843	33848	33849	33849	She	320	“ I ’m good . ”
34195	34216	34217	34217	Jolie	67	“ Your father told me not to ask at the risk of being nosy , but … I have to , ”
34227	34273	34274	34275	Her mother	488	“ Why in heaven ’s name are you dating the man who only a few days ago you called a ‘ corporate tyrant ’ ? I mean , do n’t get me wrong , I have eyes and I can see he ’s terribly attractive . ”
34280	34299	34274	34275	Her mother	488	“ The whole family is . Those three boys got the best of their mother and Big Crane . ”
34398	34406	34407	34407	Merina	2471	“ We just … hit it off , ”
34422	34430	34431	34432	Her mother	53	“ Are you seeing more of him ? ”
34444	34447	34448	34448	she	2471	“ more , ”

34505	34520	34501	34502	Her mother	53	“ Mer , you do know what you ’re doing , do n’t you ? ”
34521	34525	34526	34526	She	53	“ Of course . ”
34540	34546	34547	34548	Her mother	53	“ I worry , sweetheart . ”
34554	34558	34547	34548	Her mother	53	“ Since Corbin — ”
34559	34562	34563	34563	Merina	2471	“ Mom . ”
34627	34638	34639	34639	Merina	2471	“ Are you and Dad going into the office late ? ”
34649	34661	34639	34639	Merina	2471	“ Probably this afternoon . Your father is n’t feeling well . ”
34708	34724	34725	34726	Her mother	53	“ Just a sore throat . Not his heart . He ’s fine , Mer . ”
34885	34899	34871	34872	Bob Barber	162	“ Sometimes these things shake out and there ’s nothing to worry about . ”
34900	34903	34904	34904	Reese	377	“ Sure , ”
34993	34996	34997	34997	Tag	85	“ Shit , ”
35034	35043	35012	35012	Reese	377	“ According to them , you have time . ”
35044	35057	35058	35058	Tag	85	“ I do n’t want to wait until things go tits up . ”
35074	35080	35012	35012	Reese	377	“ We ’re in agreement . ”
35081	35094	35012	35012	Reese	377	“ I ’d like it if they go back to ignoring me . ”
35095	35101	35102	35102	Reese	377	“ Welcome to the club . ”
35111	35130	35102	35102	Reese	377	“ Do n’t worry . Once they hear about the engagement , you ’ll fade into the background . ”
35131	35136	35137	35137	Tag	85	“ Let ’s hope . ”
35140	35157	35137	35137	Tag	85	“ Come out with me . Been a while since we threw back a few beers . ”
35158	35163	35164	35164	Reese	377	“ Like eight years , ”
35174	35178	35171	35171	Tag	85	“ Around that . ”
35214	35218	35219	35219	Reese	377	“ Ca n’t , ”
35222	35242	35219	35219	Reese	377	“ I ’m seeing Merina tonight , so my drinks will be had with her . And Penelope Brand . ”
35243	35248	35199	35200	his brother	471	“ The cute blonde . ”
35249	35252	35219	35219	Reese	377	“ No . ”
35253	35257	35258	35259	His brother	471	“ Not interested . ”
35269	35281	35258	35259	His brother	471	“ She ’s a brand of crazy I do n’t dig . ”
35297	35304	35282	35282	He	85	“ Tell Merina I said hi . ”
35305	35313	35314	35315	His brother	471	“ Will do . And , Tag ? ”
35324	35331	35314	35315	His brother	471	“ Rain check on the drinks . ”

36424	36441	36442	36442	she	121	“ You two are on the accelerated plan , which I admit was an aggressive suggestion , ”
36445	36484	36442	36442	she	121	“ But in just a few dates you ’ve pulled it off . I think after last week ’s display at Posh , you ’re going to have a lot of media interest in your wedding on Saturday . ”
36485	36491	36492	36492	Merina	2471	“ That came really fast , ”
36495	36501	36502	36502	Reese	377	“ Whirlwind romance , remember ? ”
36542	36599	36515	36515	he	971	“ It ’s fast enough that tongues will be wagging , which is what you want . This needs to be big , a sensation on the gossip outlets . The more attention you get , the more speculation you ’ll have , so be sure you ’re always ‘ on , ’ no matter what . ”
36600	36608	36609	36609	Merina	2471	“ Like our own reality television show , ”
36612	36615	36616	36616	Pen	121	“ Exactly . ”

36723	36768	36769	36769	She	121	“ Merina , you ’ll need to begin moving your things soon . After the wedding , there ’ll be no more going home for any reason . Happily married couples spend all their time together . You two are infatuated . Remember that . ”
36780	36793	36794	36794	Reese	377	“ I ’ll have Bobbie send movers to collect Merina ’s things . ”
36819	36827	36799	36799	his	165	“ Just let her know what day . ”

52884	52890	52891	52891	she	2471	“ You need a bloodhound , ”
52899	52902	52903	52903	His	1207	“ Merina . ”
52947	52953	52922	52922	she	2471	“ You have two kitchens ? ”
52954	52957	52958	52958	He	1207	“ Apparently . ”
53050	53068	53069	53069	Reese	377	“ I ’m not sleeping in the same house as you . You can fucking keep it ! ”
53138	53144	53145	53145	She	377	“ You ’re being unfair ! ”
53156	53159	53160	53160	He	1207	“ Me ? ”
53182	53187	53188	53188	His	1207	“ Hayes , Gwyneth ? ”
53200	53219	53188	53188	His	1207	“ You could have chosen anyone to fuck me over for , and you chose goddamn Hayes Lerner ? ”
53288	53291	53292	53292	His	1207	“ Anyone ! ”
53777	53781	53782	53782	Merina	2471	“ Thank God , ”
53789	53801	53782	53782	Merina	2471	“ I thought we ’d end up in the garage next . ”
53904	53916	53917	53917	he	69	“ You can find your way from here , I assume , ”
53927	53931	53932	53932	She	2471	“ I can . ”
53944	53949	53950	53950	Moonbeams	201	“ Then do it . ”
54357	54365	54366	54366	she	2471	“ Well . Look who ’s up , ”
54446	54450	54451	54451	he	69	“ Good morning , ”
54460	54488	54489	54489	She	2471	“ My bed was lonely . Care to share where you spent last night ? Here at the table ? On your yacht ? Or did you … ”
54560	54567	54568	54568	he	723	“ I ’m sorry , darling , ”
54575	54592	54568	54568	he	723	“ I ended up working until almost four in the morning and slept in the office . ”
54605	54621	54593	54593	He	723	“ You were so exhausted last night , I did n’t want to wake you . ”
54703	54706	54697	54697	He	723	“ Cream ? ”
54720	54724	54725	54725	she	2447	“ Not today , ”
54743	54753	54754	54754	he	723	“ Keeping me on my toes , I see , ”
54788	54796	54797	54797	he	723	“ Can I drop you at work ? ”
54814	54821	54822	54822	she	2447	“ I ’d prefer to drive , ”
54834	54844	54849	54849	he	723	“ All right , then . See you tonight . ”
54863	54869	54849	54849	he	723	“ have a nice day . ”
54996	55001	55002	55002	he	723	“ I trust her , ”
55006	55020	55002	55002	he	723	“ but I do want to give her the benefit of plausible deniability . ”
55269	55280	55281	55281	he	69	“ Dad ’s party will require a bit of acting , ”
55289	55297	55281	55281	he	69	“ On your part , you mean ? ”
55380	55385	55386	55386	he	69	“ Both our parts , ”
55389	55406	55386	55386	he	69	“ Lately we ’ve been distant . Understandable , seeing as how busy we ’ve been . ”
55407	55410	55411	55411	She	2471	“ Busy ? ”
55418	55433	55411	55411	She	2471	“ You tore me out of my clothes and left me by the stairs . ”
55492	55501	55502	55502	he	69	“ We agreed getting physical would be confusing , ”
55510	55514	55515	55515	she	2471	“ Who agreed ? ”
55547	55549	55536	55536	he	69	“ real ”
55552	55554	55541	55555	a woman who demanded they have “ real ” feelings and “ real ” conversations	1284	“ real ”
55571	55580	55581	55581	he	69	“ It ’s not ideal , I admit , ”
55588	55618	55619	55619	he	69	“ I can have the house staff reduce their hours so they ’re here when we ’re not . That way , we can — Where are you going ? ”
55629	55634	55635	55635	she	1284	“ I ’m tired , ”
56139	56143	56144	56144	He	411	“ I do . ”
56611	56619	56620	56620	Her	2471	“ What are you doing up here ? ”
56748	56753	56754	56754	She	2471	“ Do you mind ? ”
56765	56772	56773	56773	he	1306	“ We need to resolve this , ”
56790	56801	56802	56802	She	2471	“ Oh , did you come up here to renegotiate ? ”
56833	56843	56844	56844	Her	2471	“ So we can impress your stupid board tomorrow ? ”
56848	56883	56844	56844	Her	2471	“ What if I do n’t feel like playing dancing monkey to your organ ? What if I decide to be my real , true self instead of the plastic me you insist on ? ”
56884	56896	56905	56905	she	2471	“ Are you forgetting the purpose of this marriage , Merina ? ”
56955	56977	56978	56978	He	1306	“ You endure me until I ’m named CEO and receive the Van Heusen in return . Is it so hard ? ”
56993	57022	56978	56978	He	1306	“ It ’s occurring to me I did n’t negotiate enough into my end of the deal , Crane . Enduring you is more difficult than I anticipated . ”
57068	57082	57085	57085	her	2471	“ Do n’t worry about my feelings , Merina . I have none . ”
57099	57109	57110	57110	He	1306	“ Tell me again how hard your life is . ”
57122	57169	57110	57110	He	1306	“ Your meals are made . You can sleep in any one of ten bedrooms . Your food is prepared by someone else , your messes cleaned for you . You have access to a yacht and a spending account to do with as you please . ”
57170	57177	57178	57178	she	2471	“ Is this a guilt trip ? ”
57215	57224	57225	57225	he	1306	“ At the end of your time served , ”
57229	57253	57254	57254	He	1306	“ you will have the hotel I purchased at market value free and clear . What more could you have possibly asked for ? ”
57294	57300	57301	57301	she	2471	“ What else , indeed ? ”
57311	57324	57301	57301	she	2471	“ That ’s all there is to life , is n’t there ? ”
57334	57340	57341	57341	he	1306	“ That about covers it , ”
57344	57349	57350	57350	Her	2471	“ What about family ? ”
57364	57368	57356	57356	She	2471	“ Emotional connection ? ”
57377	57394	57399	57399	she	2471	“ Sex . Closeness . A night spent in someone ’s arms instead of being alone . ”
57478	57484	57485	57485	She	2471	“ I ’m just tired . ”
57520	57524	57508	57508	she	2471	“ Never mind . ”
57525	57529	57530	57530	he	1306	“ Never mind , ”
57538	57544	57533	57533	she	2471	“ Is that like fine ? ”
57581	57600	57563	57563	She	2471	“ I ’ll probably read a little , then call Lorelei . I need someone to talk to . ”
57612	57636	57601	57601	She	2471	“ Apparently that ’s not in my contract . Do I need to go elsewhere or will you be leaving this room soon ? ”
57684	57687	57688	57688	she	2471	“ Hey ! ”
57711	57724	57691	57691	He	1306	“ Who do you think you ’re talking to , Mrs. Crane ? ”
57750	57756	57757	57757	he	1306	“ Will sex fix it ? ”
57768	57772	57773	57773	he	1306	“ Will it ? ”
57776	57781	57782	57782	she	2471	“ Of course not , ”
57892	57898	57899	57899	he	1306	“ I made you cry , ”
57916	57919	57920	57920	she	2471	“ Yes , ”
57923	57934	57920	57920	she	2471	“ I do n’t like that I made you cry . ”
57935	57943	57944	57944	She	2471	“ So do n’t do it again . ”
57953	57967	57944	57944	She	2471	“ Sex might not fix it , but it ’s worth a shot . ”
57975	57982	57983	57983	He	1306	“ God , I want you . ”
57991	57996	57997	57997	She	2471	“ Then take me . ”
58363	58366	58344	58344	He	1306	“ Hot . ”
58367	58370	58371	58371	she	2158	“ Wet , ”
58515	58523	58528	58528	him	1306	“ Not yet , you do n’t . ”
58539	58544	58528	58528	him	1306	“ Wait for me . ”
58619	58622	58614	58614	he	1306	“ Careful . ”
58657	58662	58663	58663	she	2158	“ Reese ’s rocket , ”
58681	58686	58669	58669	His	1306	“ In the flesh . ”
58691	58703	58687	58687	His	1306	“ What am I going to do with you , Merina ? ”
58704	58710	58669	58669	His	1306	“ I think you know . ”
58850	58856	58857	58857	Her	2471	“ Say yes , Merina . ”
59009	59012	59013	59013	he	1306	“ Finally , ”
59028	59032	59020	59020	he	1306	“ Found it . ”
59033	59038	59039	59039	she	2471	“ We ’ll see , ”
59063	59071	59072	59072	he	1306	“ Give it to me , Merina , ”
59081	59085	59054	59054	her	2471	“ Not until … ”
59099	59103	59054	59054	her	2471	“ … you . ”
59104	59111	59112	59112	He	1306	“ Ladies first . I insist . ”
59332	59339	59316	59316	She	377	“ You know a few tricks . ”
59352	59353	59358	59358	her	377	“ That”—he
59359	59364	59358	59358	her	377	nose—“was a good idea . ”
59439	59443	59444	59444	She	377	“ No bragging . ”
59457	59461	59462	59462	He	1306	“ No need . ”
59479	59490	59476	59476	he	1306	“ Your body tells me everything I need to know . ”
59529	59534	59535	59535	He	1306	“ Do n’t worry . ”
59538	59544	59535	59535	He	1306	“ I wo n’t tell . ”
59632	59635	59614	59614	Alex	69	“ Subtle . ”
59636	59643	59644	59644	Tag	85	“ I thought it was nice . ”
59651	59653	59655	59655	he	85	“ nice ”
59727	59732	59733	59733	Alex	69	“ It ’s flashy , ”
59737	59749	59750	59750	Alex	69	“ Penelope assures me turning the media will convince the board . ”
59753	59761	59762	59762	Reese	377	“ Tomorrow night ’s the retirement party , ”
59765	59771	59762	59762	Reese	377	“ They ’ll see then . ”
59893	59901	59902	59902	She	2471	“ Thanks for the recharge , Crane . ”
59906	59914	59902	59902	She	2471	“ I have monthly reports to review . ”
60058	60065	60066	60066	Alex	69	“ Anyway , I ’m off , ”
60078	60090	60075	60075	Tag	85	“ You fucking did it . You had sex with Merina . ”
60091	60097	60098	60098	Reese	377	“ She ’s my wife . ”
60129	60136	60137	60137	Tag	85	“ Proud of you , Clip . ”
60200	60203	60204	60204	Tag	85	“ Careful , ”
60207	60216	60204	60204	Tag	85	“ Girls get attached . They want more . ”
60217	60243	60244	60244	Reese	377	“ Thank you , Tag . I ’m sure as a man who has perfected the hookup and breakup , you have loads of advice . ”
60249	60269	60204	60204	Tag	85	“ Hey , I ’m just looking out for you . There is a reason Dad is still single . ”
60270	60278	60279	60279	Reese	377	“ Because he ’s focused on work , ”
60282	60310	60311	60311	Tag	85	“ And there ’s a reason you ’ve had Bobbie send flowers and a note of cease and desist to every date you ’ve had since Gwyneth … ”
60315	60318	60311	60311	Tag	85	“ Sorry . ”
60319	60322	60323	60323	He	85	“ Relax . ”
60345	60367	60333	60333	Mom	67	“ This marriage has an expiration date . When it ’s over , so is the sex . Merina understands that . ”
60436	60442	60443	60443	Tag	85	“ There are always strings , ”
60455	60471	60443	60443	Tag	85	“ Once you ’re crowned CEO , she might not appreciate you blowing her off . ”
60472	60483	60484	60484	Reese	377	“ She ’s making out like a bandit , Tag . ”
60491	60526	60484	60484	Reese	377	“ Her hotel will be in her name , free and clear . She could n’t care less about my position at Crane save for the fact it ’s getting her what she wants . ”
60593	60600	60590	60590	Reese	377	“ I ’m sure of it . ”
60601	60608	60609	60609	Tag	85	“ You deserve to be CEO . ”
60624	60641	60609	60609	Tag	85	“ Just … make sure you do n’t get too attached to your ‘ wife . ’ ”
60642	60650	60651	60651	Reese	377	“ I know what I ’m doing . ”
60672	60678	60679	60679	Tag	85	“ I know you do . ”
60713	60718	60700	60700	he	85	“ And , Clip ? ”
60722	60745	60700	60700	he	85	“ You can fuck her . But do n’t fuck her over . She ’s not one of your one - nighters . ”
60785	60790	60791	60791	He	2447	“ Your cards came . ”
60904	60913	60884	60885	three people	1339	“ Marriage looks good on you , Merina . ”
60928	60944	60947	60947	she	2471	“ Thank you , Arnold . I did n’t even think to change the cards . ”
60957	60965	60971	60971	she	2471	“ You have your mother to thank . ”
60985	60998	60999	60999	His	1340	“ I always wondered how different marriage was for women than men . ”
61004	61041	60999	60999	His	1340	“ My wife had to leave her family and move to my house . Change her name to my last name . And let me tell you , she was not excited about becoming a Woodcock . ”
61084	61133	61134	61134	Merina	2471	“ Adeline was a strong woman , but she was old - fashioned . She said that things were supposed to be like that according to God . A woman submitting to her husband . Did you know that verse does n’t mean what people think it means ? ”
61159	61246	61247	61247	He	2447	“ People think it means to come under someone ’s control , but that ’s not the translation . If a wife submits to a husband , she ’s giving him a gift . She ’s giving him the opportunity to be a man . Without that lesson , he wo n’t be strong . Instead , he will be weak and in response , she will feel as if she has to protect herself . That ’s not the way it ’s supposed to be . ”
61253	61290	61247	61247	He	2447	“ Just because you women can protect yourselves and be your own warriors does n’t mean you should . Men need a chance to do that too . To protect and love you makes us better . ”
61291	61301	61302	61302	she	1343	“ I … never thought of it that way , ”
61381	61389	61390	61390	Arnold	2447	“ Love suits you , Mrs. Crane . ”
61404	61410	61398	61398	she	1343	“ Hang on to that . ”
61411	61418	61419	61419	she	1343	“ Adeline was a lucky lady , ”
61439	61444	61445	61445	he	2447	“ I was lucky , ”
61448	61459	61445	61445	he	2447	“ I was n’t this man before I knew her . ”
61527	61529	61521	61521	Arnold	2447	“ spring ”
61533	61536	61521	61521	Arnold	2447	“ frisky , ”
61687	61692	61693	61693	he	212	“ I texted you , ”
61776	61782	61783	61783	She	2471	“ Things have been nuts . ”
61814	61822	61823	61823	He	212	“ Let me take you to dinner . ”
61888	61893	61894	61894	Merina	2471	“ Hello , Reese . ”
61906	61911	61912	61912	He	212	“ Mrs. Van Heusen . ”
61927	61946	61912	61912	He	212	“ I was going to say drinks first , but you look as if you need to eat . ”
61947	61970	61972	61973	my God	321	“ You can call me Jolie , Reese . Or Mom , I guess . Since you ’re technically our son now . ”
61975	61978	61979	61979	She	321	“ Mom . ”
61993	62002	62003	62003	Jolie	67	“ Did you see your new business cards ? ”
62007	62014	61972	61973	my God	321	“ I did . Thank you . ”
62015	62019	62020	62020	Merina	2471	“ Did Reese ? ”
62042	62054	62055	62055	Merina	2471	“ He has now . I ’ll just grab my things , ”
62073	62079	62080	62080	Jolie	67	“ What are you doing ? ”
62105	62123	62083	62083	She	2471	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re up to , but please try and behave yourself . ”
62124	62129	62130	62130	Jolie	67	“ You married him . ”
62133	62143	62130	62130	Jolie	67	“ Do you not want me to be friendly ? ”
62144	62154	62166	62166	Fake	213	“ Friendly , yes , but fake , no . ”

69853	69869	69842	69842	Reese	377	“ She told me where she and Hayes were sitting so I could say hello . ”
69879	69887	69888	69888	Merina	2471	“ It looked more intimate than that , ”
69895	69922	69870	69870	His	450	“ After this song , I ’ll introduce you . You should n’t have been in the position to introduce yourself and I apologize for that . ”
69929	69932	69923	69923	His	450	“ Reese . ”
69933	69936	69937	69937	He	450	“ Merina . ”
69973	69982	69963	69963	she	2471	“ Do you want to talk about it ? ”
69993	69997	69998	69998	he	450	“ Not here , ”
70016	70018	70019	70019	she	2471	“ no ”
70024	70038	70019	70019	she	2471	“ I wo n’t give you a reason to worry again , Merina . ”
70097	70099	70100	70100	Corbin	113	“ help ”
70302	70339	70295	70295	he	1466	“ Gwyneth and I used to be together . We ended things amicably . Hayes was an employee of Crane Hotels — manager of quality control for a while — until my father let him go . ”
70358	70368	70369	70369	Merina	2471	“ Sounds like there ’s more to that story , ”
70449	70460	70428	70428	He	1471	“ There is , but now ’s not the time . ”
70461	70465	70466	70466	They	1468	“ Fair enough . ”
70597	70605	70606	70606	Hayes	132	“ I guess congratulations are in order , ”
70612	70627	70606	70606	Hayes	132	“ On your marriage and I assume you ’re taking over for your dad . ”
70628	70642	70643	70643	Reese	377	“ One of those for sure , the other is to be determined , ”
70709	70713	70714	70714	He	132	“ Hayes Lerner . ”
70747	70751	70752	70752	She	2471	“ Mr. Lerner . ”
70806	70815	70816	70816	Merina	2471	“ Your lovely wife and I met earlier , ”
70839	70853	70854	70854	Merina	2471	“ It was kind of you to come out and wish Alex well , ”
70857	70875	70854	70854	Merina	2471	“ I ’m sure it was n’t easy for either of you to show your faces here . ”
70887	70895	70896	70896	Gwyneth	2460	“ I have no problem being here , ”
70963	70970	70971	70971	Hayes	132	“ Alex taught me a lot , ”
70985	71024	70971	70971	Hayes	132	“ Gwynnie reminded me that I was the bigger man by showing up here . Which is why we came . We ’d never miss Alex ’s retirement . No matter how you feel about us being here . ”
71062	71069	71070	71070	Merina	2471	“ Alex is a good man . ”
71083	71107	71113	71113	she	2471	“ I ’m sure he can see exactly what you are trying to accomplish by being here . If you ’ll excuse us . ”
71116	71148	71113	71113	she	2471	“ I ’m going to sneak out of here for a moment with Reese . You remember how hard it was to keep your hands off him , I ’m sure . ”
71190	71230	71169	71169	She	2471	“ Mmm . Thank you . I know that was n’t mine , but I saw it and just had to have it . You know what that ’s like . Try the crab bites . To die for . ”
71281	71293	71294	71294	she	2471	“ Now find us a closet so I can kiss you , ”
71306	71310	71311	71311	He	2460	“ No closet . ”
71344	71349	71334	71334	He	2460	“ Let ’em watch . ”
71567	71571	71572	71572	she	2471	“ Cocky bastard , ”
71614	71622	71603	71603	he	2460	“ Do you always wake up smiling ? ”
71664	71669	71670	71670	he	2460	“ I wake smiling , ”
71678	71692	71670	71670	he	2460	“ whenever the woman I go to bed with has six screaming orgasms . ”
71693	71696	71697	71697	she	2471	“ Six ! ”
71709	71718	71719	71719	He	2460	“ Was it seven ? I lost count . ”
71735	71738	71739	71739	She	2471	“ Hardly . ”
71788	71794	71795	71795	he	2460	“ I ’m still smiling , ”
71930	71947	71948	71948	he	2460	“ I was going to run this morning , but you wiped me out last night . ”
71968	71971	71948	71948	he	2460	“ What ? ”
71972	71988	71948	71948	he	2460	“ I have a cabinet full of mugs and that ’s the one you choose . ”
71989	71994	71995	71995	She	2471	“ I like it . ”
72001	72007	71948	71948	he	2460	“ Of course you do . ”
72008	72013	71948	71948	he	2460	“ It ’s comforting . ”
72014	72020	71948	71948	he	2460	“ Of course it is . ”
72058	72066	72067	72067	She	2471	“ You mean this is … yours ? ”
72077	72089	72067	72067	She	2471	“ ‘ Sometimes all you need is a billion dollars . ’ ”
72170	72175	72176	72176	Reese	377	“ Tag bought it , ”
72179	72186	72176	72176	Reese	377	“ He thinks he ’s funny . ”
72244	72259	72234	72234	She	2471	“ What did he say at the party that pissed you off so much ? ”
72260	72276	72234	72234	She	2471	“ It was n’t what he said . It was … I do n’t know . ”
72378	72386	72387	72387	she	2471	“ I was just pissed about Gwyneth , ”
72390	72393	72387	72387	she	2471	“ Ah . ”
72402	72421	72422	72422	He	85	“ You handled her and Hayes beautifully , which was why you received so many presents last night . ”
72427	72449	72422	72422	He	85	“ Like I said , I was going to go for a run today , but you let me sleep in . ”
72450	72461	72478	72478	she	377	“ You needed it . We had a stressful weekend . ”
72551	72568	72569	72569	She	2471	“ Are you sure you do n’t want to tell me more about your sordid past ? ”
72621	72625	72626	72626	He	85	“ Nice try . ”
72638	72669	72626	72626	He	85	“ I can drop you at work , but I have to go to a dinner meeting at eight , so you ’ll have to find your own way home . ”
72670	72696	72720	72720	She	1496	“ No , that ’s okay . I have to run a few errands while I ’m at work . I ’ll take my car . ”
72706	72719	72626	72626	He	85	“ Okay . By the way , you should try that sometime . ”
72733	72743	72744	72744	He	85	“ Having a billion dollars . It ’s handy . ”
72762	72767	72744	72744	He	85	“ See you tonight . ”
72894	72902	72903	72903	Her	2471	“ I ’m in love with him . ”
72925	72928	72910	72910	Merina	2471	“ Malcolm ? ”
72929	72933	72934	72934	Lorelei	606	“ I know ! ”
72969	72976	72961	72961	She	2471	“ I did n’t mean to . ”
72977	72982	72983	72983	Merina	2471	“ This is awful , ”
73014	73022	72998	72998	Lorelei	606	“ It is , is n’t it ? ”
73023	73060	73061	73061	She	2471	“ I meant for me . You were supposed to be the voice of reason . I came here to talk to you about keeping my heart out of the equation with Reese since we ’ve … ”
73074	73080	73061	73061	She	2471	“ Crossed a few boundaries . ”
73090	73093	73081	73081	Lorelei	606	“ Boundaries ? ”
73097	73104	73094	73094	Merina	2471	“ Did he earn his hashtag ? ”
73105	73110	73111	73111	She	2471	“ Lore ! Seriously ? ”
73130	73154	73111	73111	She	2471	“ That ’s what you want to know ? Out of everything I said , that ’s what you ’re most interested in . ”
73168	73196	73155	73155	Lorelei	606	“ Yes , okay ? Yes , he earned it and honestly , it ’s terribly uninventive and a lame descriptor for what he ’s capable of . ”
73197	73227	73111	73111	She	2471	“ Well , maybe you are the only one who knows what he ’s capable of since he ’s kept you in his bed for more than one night . ”
73310	73320	73321	73321	Lorelei	606	“ Listen , you ’re going to be fine . ”
73352	73356	73329	73329	She	2471	“ Hit me . ”
73357	73361	73362	73362	Lorelei	606	“ First off . ”
73368	73375	73376	73376	Her	606	“ Malcolm and I were married . ”
73380	73415	73376	73376	Her	606	“ Of course , so are you and Reese . Maybe that ’s a bad place to start . You know what I mean . We were really married . Like , for real . ”
73416	73422	73423	73423	Merina	2471	“ I ’m with you . ”
73447	73458	73459	73459	Lore	375	“ Malcolm and I have a relationship that is volatile , ”
73462	73483	73459	73459	Lore	375	“ You know , the kind where everyone has a quip for everything . Bickering became like foreplay with us . ”
73497	73558	73559	73559	Lorelei	606	“ Plus he had a rep before he met me of being quite the ladies ’ man . Once he met me , he quit those bitches cold and I was the only one he had eyes for . He went from player to a good husband and the only reason we split was because I was too stubborn to — ”
73600	73605	73606	73606	Lore	375	“ Sorry , honey . ”
73635	73643	73621	73621	she	375	“ It ’s not for sure yet , ”
73652	73685	73644	73644	Lorelei	606	“ Maybe he ’ll turn back into a dick . Like … Cinderella at the stroke of midnight . Give him time and he ’ll give you a reason to hate him . ”
73686	73689	73690	73690	Merina	2471	“ Okay , ”
73735	73754	73755	73755	Bob	162	“ With the exit of Alex , we ’ll be deciding who to appoint within the next month , ”
73796	73804	73805	73805	Alex	69	“ You know my preference , gentlemen , ”
73826	73858	73816	73816	he	69	“ Reese is my number one . He ’s been groomed for this role since he was a young man . He ’s good at his job . He works hard . ”
73859	73864	73865	73865	Frank	89	“ We ’re aware , ”
73918	73923	73924	73924	Bob	162	“ I will say , ”
73935	73952	73924	73924	Bob	162	“ that the few stockholders I ’ve spoken to have been impressed with his recent turnaround . ”
73953	73964	73965	73965	Frank	89	“ Yes , and the few I ’ve talked to , ”
73968	73984	73965	73965	Frank	89	“ are suspicious of this sudden marriage and abrupt change in Mr. Crane ’s behavior . ”
73985	74001	74002	74002	Reese	377	“ The state of my personal life has nothing to do with my business ethics , ”
74022	74030	74016	74017	his father	430	“ Leave my wife out of this . ”
74031	74048	74049	74049	Lilith	90	“ And yet , you ’ve been sure to include her at the most opportune time , ”
74052	74087	74049	74049	Lilith	90	“ Do n’t get me wrong , Reese , I ’m all for a reformed man , but who ’s to say this is n’t a ruse to earn favor and land the CEO ? ”
74118	74132	74107	74107	he	430	“ Come on , Lilith . You saw them at the retirement party . ”
74133	74139	74140	74140	she	90	“ Could be an act , ”
74148	74170	74171	74171	Frank	89	“ Well you ca n’t expect them to consummate on the boardroom table for you to see how serious they are , ”
74185	74190	74191	74191	Reese	377	“ Over the line . ”
74201	74221	74191	74191	Reese	377	“ If you think I ’d pander to you or the stockholders , you ’re out of your mind . ”
74261	74312	74322	74322	Alex	69	“ My father is right . I ’ve been groomed for CEO my entire life . Lilith , as someone who used to be friends with my mother , I ’d think you ’d have more respect for my choice of woman to settle down with . She would approve . ”
74313	74317	74318	74318	Lilith	90	“ She would , ”
74344	74442	74331	74331	his	69	“ And , Frank , unless you ’d like the entire room to imagine what you ’d look like having sex with that twenty - eight - year - old wannabe actress you ’re dating , I ’d thank you to never paint a visual like you just did about Merina . As for the rest of you serpents , if you could call on whatever professionalism still clinging to your recently shed skin , you might consider my talents , my motivation , and my work record rather than who I take to bed every night . ”
74458	74476	74443	74443	Reese	377	“ If you ’ll excuse me , I have to prepare for a real meeting this evening . ”
74511	74518	74519	74519	Merina	2471	“ What a bunch of cockroaches , ”
74546	74555	74533	74533	She	2471	“ Where is a knife in this kitchen ? ”
74559	74565	74556	74556	He	69	“ How would I know ? ”
74573	74580	74581	74581	He	69	“ Does not require a knife . ”
74588	74605	74581	74581	He	69	“ Anyway , Magda does all the cooking around here , do n’t you , Magda ? ”
74606	74615	74616	74617	his housekeeper	1514	“ Top left , next to the refrigerator , ”
74631	74639	74640	74640	he	69	“ What are you doing , anyway ? ”
74649	74655	74625	74626	The woman	2471	“ I ’m making guacamole . ”
74656	74659	74625	74626	The woman	2471	“ Why ? ”
74660	74667	74668	74668	She	2471	“ Why am I making guacamole ? ”
74687	74730	74625	74626	The woman	2471	“ I do n’t want to know why you ’re making guacamole . I want to know why you do n’t have Magda make guacamole ? She likes to make things . That ’s why she works here . Right , Magda ? ”
74750	74781	74731	74731	Magda	164	“ I do indeed , Mr. Crane . It ’s nice to cook for someone again , seeing as how you ’ve been away from the mansion for so long . ”
74816	74827	74828	74828	Merina	2471	“ Sometimes it ’s fun to do things for yourself , ”
74847	74863	74864	74864	Reese	377	“ But most of the time it ’s nice to have things done to you , ”
74867	74874	74864	74864	Reese	377	“ I mean , for you . ”
74918	74933	74934	74934	She	2471	“ You were n’t born with a silver spoon in your mouth , Crane . ”
74945	74957	74934	74934	She	2471	“ You were born with an entire cutlery drawer in there . ”
74991	74996	74997	74997	he	232	“ What was that ? ”
75029	75033	75008	75008	She	2471	“ New perfume ? ”
75034	75041	74997	74997	he	232	“ Yes , you bought it . ”
75042	75047	75008	75008	She	2471	“ You ’re welcome . ”
75048	75055	75056	75056	she	2471	“ No , you ’re welcome , ”
75059	75073	75074	75074	He	232	“ Magda , I ’m going to need a moment with my wife . ”
75118	75127	75128	75128	he	232	“ Second thought , take the evening off , ”
75141	75147	75148	75148	Magda	164	“ Just like your parents . ”
75159	75163	75148	75148	Magda	164	“ Good night . ”
75231	75234	75236	75236	his	232	“ Why is it”—he
75239	75254	75236	75236	his	232	hers—“that when you sass me , all I want to do is fuck you ? ”
75333	75344	75318	75318	She	2471	“ What did Magda mean we ’re like your parents ? ”
75364	75373	75355	75355	She	2471	“ Tell me . I want to know . ”
75406	75414	75415	75415	he	232	“ Mom and Dad were a nightmare , ”
75420	75443	75415	75415	he	232	“ They were insanely in love , but in a house full of boys , the gross - out factor was high . “
75496	75496	75488	75488	I	0	”
75497	75505	75506	75506	She	1521	“ So Magda means we ’re demonstrative . ”
75528	75531	75523	75523	Merina	2471	“ Hmm . ”
75539	75541	75506	75506	She	1521	“ fine ”
75543	75547	75506	75506	She	1521	“ never mind . ”
75548	75559	75506	75506	She	1521	“ She ’s known you a long time , then ? ”
75560	75578	75506	75506	She	1521	“ Since I was ten . She was part - time then , raising her own kids . ”
75579	75588	75589	75589	Merina	2471	“ I did n’t know she has children , ”
75595	75603	75604	75604	he	232	“ I did n’t know you cared , ”
75613	75618	75604	75604	he	232	“ She has three . ”
75636	75650	75651	75651	she	2471	“ My parents kiss each other on the cheek and on the forehead , ”
75660	75680	75651	75651	she	2471	“ They lovingly bicker . But I ca n’t say I ’ve ever seen them passionate with each other . ”
75692	75695	75681	75681	She	2471	“ Eww . ”
75696	75703	75704	75704	His	232	“ You are n’t missing out . ”
75726	75733	75734	75734	She	2471	“ You ’re good at that . ”
75739	75750	75734	75734	She	2471	“ I guess you ’ve had a lot of practice . ”
75751	75760	75722	75722	he	232	“ A trap I refuse to walk into . ”
75761	75765	75773	75773	she	2471	“ Smart man . ”
75785	75792	75773	75773	she	2471	“ Tell me about your mom . ”
75793	75796	75797	75797	He	232	“ Merina . ”
75815	75827	75773	75773	she	2471	“ Other than the fact you named your boat after her . ”
75828	75834	75835	75835	He	232	“ It ’s a yacht . ”

78718	78728	78694	78694	He	232	“ You ’d think after the counter , the kitchen chair”—her
78748	78768	78738	78738	Reese	377	ago—“then sliding me halfway across this ice - cold floor , you ’d have a dirtier word for it . ”

84268	84271	84263	84263	she	2471	“ sauced . ”
84272	84283	84263	84263	she	2471	“ Unless you ’re driving , you should bunk here . ”
84284	84291	84263	84263	she	2471	“ Oh , um … okay . ”
84292	84300	84301	84301	Alex	69	“ Good . I ’d like that . ”
84332	84351	84263	84263	she	2471	“ I’m … uh … I saw photos and wanted to see the boys when they were boys . ”
84352	84363	84364	84364	Alex	69	“ Ah . There are some good ones in here . ”
84370	84378	84379	84379	he	69	“ Arguably , Tag never grew up , ”
84387	84406	84407	84407	He	69	“ But , yeah , that ’s them when they were younger . That one is my favorite . ”
84465	84477	84478	84478	she	377	“ The yard has n’t changed much , but they have , ”
84502	84511	84512	84512	His	69	“ Luna ’s death hit Reese the hardest . ”
84538	84549	84550	84550	she	377	“ Which of your sons looks the most like her ? ”
84583	84593	84594	84594	he	69	“ This was a few years before she died , ”
84598	84603	84604	84604	Merina	2471	“ She ’s beautiful . ”
84619	84622	84604	84604	Merina	2471	“ Reese . ”
84642	84645	84623	84623	Alex	69	“ Tag . ”
84650	84656	84646	84646	She	357	“ Eli has her sensitivity . ”
84657	84662	84623	84623	Alex	69	“ A sensitive marine ? ”
84663	84667	84668	84668	Alex	69	“ We exist , ”
84686	84694	84677	84677	He	69	“ Reese does n’t like being here . ”
84695	84699	84623	84623	Alex	69	“ I noticed . ”
84700	84733	84677	84677	He	69	“ Maybe because he ’s the oldest and knew her longer , or maybe because I handled things better with Tag and Eli . Either way , he prefers not to visit . ”
84734	84743	84744	84744	Merina	2471	“ But he does because he loves you , ”
84747	84754	84755	84755	Alex	69	“ He ’s a good boy . ”
84764	84775	84755	84755	Alex	69	“ Remember that when everything ’s through . Will you ? ”
84776	84780	84677	84677	He	69	“ I will . ”
84788	84817	84781	84781	He	69	“ I ’ll make a phone call to Magda to let her know you ’re staying . Have her drop a change of clothes for each of you . ”
84836	84850	84851	84851	Alex	69	“ Magda knows him . Loves him . She looks out for him . ”
84859	84879	84851	84851	Alex	69	“ When Reese bought his house , I sent her there to work for him . And let me tell you”—he
84884	84894	84851	84851	Alex	69	earnest—“I did not want to give up those tamales . ”
84895	84908	84909	84909	They	1675	“ Oh , I had those . I do n’t blame you . ”
84975	84984	84985	84985	Alex	69	“ He needed Magda more than I did , ”
85028	85037	85038	85038	Alex	69	“ Since you ’re staying , more wine ? ”
85046	85051	85052	85052	she	1676	“ Always more wine , ”
85057	85067	85068	85068	Alex	69	“ You fit in here , you know that ? ”
85179	85182	85165	85165	Her	377	“ Chardonnay , ”
85352	85356	85357	85358	The waitress	1502	“ Excuse me . ”
85368	85374	85357	85358	The waitress	1502	“ I know this is really inappropriate”—she
85380	85397	85357	85358	The waitress	1502	continuing—“but is there any way you could introduce me to the guy with the long hair ? ”
85398	85405	85406	85406	Merina	2471	“ You want to meet Tag ? ”
85441	85450	85451	85451	She	2471	“ I could lose my job , but … ”
85467	85479	85451	85451	She	2471	“ God , he ’d be worth it , I bet . ”
85532	85538	85539	85539	Merina	2471	“ He is very attractive , ”
85628	85633	85634	85634	she	1695	“ I ’m Merina , ”
85637	85640	85641	85641	Her	1695	“ Taylor . ”
85656	85670	85621	85621	she	1695	“ You ’ve never worked for the Cranes before , I take it ? ”
85671	85678	85679	85679	She	1695	“ Oh , yeah . But … ”
85691	85699	85679	85679	She	1695	“ I ’ve never talked to him . ”
85734	85744	85745	85745	Merina	2471	“ Lucky for you , I know him well . ”
85756	85759	85745	85745	Merina	2471	“ Ready ? ”
85767	85770	85760	85760	Taylor	254	“ Ready . ”
85774	85779	85780	85780	Reese	377	“ You baited him , ”
85934	85941	85942	85942	Merina	2471	“ I did n’t bait him , ”
85945	85962	85963	85963	She	2471	“ I made an introduction . Taylor wanted to know what kind of shampoo he used . ”
85983	85986	85988	85988	his	1701	“ Baited . ”
86047	86056	86057	86057	He	1701	“ Did she put my mouthwash in there ? ”
86069	86075	86076	86076	She	2471	“ Yes , Your Highness . ”
86181	86186	86187	86187	Merina	2471	“ That was brief , ”
86213	86218	86219	86219	He	1701	“ What was brief ? ”
86225	86230	86231	86231	She	2471	“ Your light mood . ”
86321	86330	86338	86338	He	1701	“ Softest fucking skin I ’ve ever felt . ”
86354	86357	86358	86358	she	2471	“ Ever ? ”
86385	86388	86389	86389	He	1701	“ Ever . ”
86398	86407	86389	86389	He	1701	“ What ’d you and Dad talk about ? ”
86417	86430	86408	86408	He	1701	“ We ’re not talking about family while I ’m seducing you . ”
86431	86441	86442	86442	Her	2471	“ I ’m not having sex with you here . ”
86448	86455	86442	86442	Her	2471	“ This is your childhood bedroom . ”
86456	86469	86408	86408	He	1701	“ Actually , this one was Eli ’s , so no worries . ”
86470	86475	86476	86476	She	2471	“ That ’s worse ! ”
86484	86492	86476	86476	She	2471	“ I have n’t met him yet . ”
86564	86575	86576	86576	He	1701	“ I do n’t want to talk about my brother . ”
86608	86618	86597	86597	He	1701	“ I do n’t want to talk at all . ”
86619	86628	86594	86594	her	2471	“ I ca n’t ask about my parents — ”
86629	86632	86633	86633	He	1701	“ Nope . ”
86638	86644	86645	86645	Her	2471	“ — or your family ? ”
86693	86696	86697	86697	He	1701	“ Correct . ”
86710	86715	86716	86716	she	2471	“ Share a shower ? ”
86723	86726	86727	86727	He	1701	“ Always . ”
86753	86755	86751	86751	Merina	2471	“ always ”
86758	86761	86763	86763	he	1701	“ until , ”
86856	86863	86864	86864	she	377	“ We ca n’t do this , ”
86873	86881	86882	86882	He	1701	“ Oh , we ’re doing this . ”
86998	87006	87007	87007	he	1701	“ You ’re doing that on purpose , ”
87040	87045	87046	87046	She	2471	“ I ’m not . ”
87079	87083	87084	87084	He	1701	“ Are too . ”
87175	87183	87184	87184	he	1701	“ Have fun trying to keep quiet , ”
87226	87237	87238	87238	She	2471	“ Who says I ’ll try and keep it down ? ”
87249	87256	87257	87257	He	1701	“ Your Midwest manners , remember ? ”
87298	87312	87289	87289	he	1701	“ You ’ll have to go downstairs and face them in the morning . ”
87342	87347	87348	87348	she	2471	“ Really quiet sex , ”
87351	87360	87361	87361	he	1701	“ The quiet part is up to you , ”
87387	87392	87393	87393	She	2471	“ No , no . ”
87407	87410	87411	87411	He	1701	“ Yes . ”
87432	87437	87438	87438	she	2471	“ Reese , please , ”
87441	87455	87438	87438	she	2471	“ I … you’re right . I do n’t want to embarrass myself . ”
87559	87572	87573	87573	he	1701	“ Nice work . I do n’t think you woke anyone up , ”
87599	87623	87573	87573	he	1701	“ Well , I do n’t think Tag ’s sleeping , so maybe he and that waitress are the ones waking Dad tonight . ”
87624	87634	87595	87595	his	1701	“ Ugh . I ca n’t think about it . ”
87716	87727	87728	87728	Merina	2471	“ So what did you and Dad decide , again ? ”
87750	87757	87758	87758	he	413	“ That ’s between us men , ”
87766	87769	87758	87758	he	413	“ Reese ! ”
87770	87788	87789	87789	She	377	“ I made him promise not to tell your mother or you and then we drank scotch . ”
87792	87802	87803	87803	He	413	“ Why do you care what we talked about ? ”
87808	87816	87803	87803	He	413	“ Afraid he asked me about you ? ”
87817	87821	87828	87828	She	377	“ Did he ? ”
87885	87897	87898	87898	He	413	“ We talked about business . None of which is yours . ”
87909	87920	87921	87921	she	377	“ Do you think the board will make you CEO ? ”
87936	87945	87903	87903	her	377	“ Worried you ’ll lose the Van Heusen ? ”
87960	87965	87903	87903	her	377	“ You deserve CEO . ”
87966	87972	87973	87973	He	413	“ I ’ll get it . ”
87984	87989	87973	87973	He	413	“ Do n’t worry . ”
87990	87995	87997	87997	he	413	“ One more question . ”
88018	88023	88009	88009	He	413	“ The interrogation continues . ”
88051	88059	88024	88024	She	377	“ Tell me about you and Gwyneth . ”
88067	88100	88060	88060	His	413	“ I assumed she was more than a one - night thing when she cornered you . And you dislike Hayes . I ’m guessing because he dated her after you did ? ”
88101	88111	88112	88112	Reese	377	“ I ’m not talking about this , Merina . ”
88134	88144	88123	88123	she	377	“ You force me to draw my own conclusions . ”
88168	88185	88161	88161	She	377	“ After a torrid threesome , you became insanely jealous because Hayes was much better at — ”
88232	88240	88241	88241	He	413	“ It ’s not nearly that adventurous . ”
88338	88344	88345	88345	he	413	“ It ’s old news , ”
88355	88364	88345	88345	he	413	“ But if you really want to know … ”
88365	88369	88370	88370	She	377	“ I do . ”
88435	88461	88410	88410	He	413	“ Gwyneth and I dated when I was younger . She was after money , and not a little amount — she wanted the lifestyle . ”
88555	88561	88562	88562	he	413	“ The short of it , ”
88568	88595	88562	88562	he	413	“ was that Gwyneth was shallow and I was too young to know what to do with my money . I gave her whatever she wanted . ”
88603	88610	88611	88611	Merina	2471	“ She took advantage of you . ”
88623	88643	88611	88611	Merina	2471	“ I ’m the man , honey . She did n’t take advantage of me . Suckered me maybe . ”
88651	88657	88658	88658	she	2471	“ Did you date long ? ”
88723	88727	88718	88718	he	377	“ Not really . ”
88728	88735	88736	88736	she	2471	“ A month ? A year ? ”
88739	88745	88746	88746	he	377	“ A handful of months , ”
88818	88855	88803	88803	He	377	“ I learned a lesson I needed to learn , and she moved on to greener pastures . Hayes was an up - and - comer , or was until he was fired from Crane Hotels . ”
88856	88859	88860	88860	Merina	2471	“ Scandal , ”
88869	88873	88860	88860	Merina	2471	“ Not quite . ”
88971	88987	88988	88988	Merina	2471	“ Is she the reason you dated all of Chicago one night at a time ? ”
89187	89199	89200	89200	Reese	377	“ It ’s easier to trust a woman for a night , ”
89227	89246	89215	89215	She	2471	“ Most I could lose was the contents of my wallet . But my 401(k ) remains intact . ”
89250	89270	89247	89247	She	2471	“ Who says I wo n’t drain your accounts , Crane ? Maybe I ’m money and power hungry . ”
89282	89342	89343	89343	he	377	“ You ’re in love with a hotel . You inked the theme for the building onto your breast . You worry about your father ’s health . You ’re concerned about the college girl who more than happily went to bed with my brother tonight . I doubt , even though you ‘ do n’t like me , ’ ”
89359	89374	89343	89343	he	377	“ that you ’d tempt karma by doing something as lowly as robbing me . ”
89393	89402	89410	89410	he	377	“ You ’re a good person , Merina . ”
89415	89430	89431	89431	she	2471	“ You ’re a better person than you give yourself credit for , Reese , ”
89439	89450	89431	89431	she	2471	“ And I like you more than I used to . ”
89575	89578	89579	89579	She	2471	“ Hey . ”
89694	89700	89701	89701	she	2471	“ I do like you , ”
89709	89713	89701	89701	she	2471	“ A lot . ”
89781	89787	89760	89760	She	2471	“ Good night , Crane . ”
89788	89794	89760	89760	She	2471	“ Good night , Merina . ”
90426	90429	90415	90415	Taylor	254	“ thank you ”
90518	90527	90528	90528	he	254	“ Not even going to feed her breakfast ? ”
90546	90549	90534	90534	his	254	“ Morning . ”
90550	90556	90557	90557	Tag	85	“ She ’s all right , ”
90574	90583	90560	90560	He	85	“ Merina , you ’re looking … refreshed . ”
90631	90642	90643	90643	Tag	85	“ And sharing a mug ? You two are adorable , ”
90653	90663	90664	90664	Merina	2471	“ How do you know she ’s all right ? ”
90703	90711	90696	90696	he	85	“ What if she ’s feeling used ? ”
90712	90718	90719	90719	Tag	85	“ Trust me , Sis . ”
90731	90754	90719	90719	Tag	85	“ She ’s going back to Berkeley in a few weeks . She does n’t want anything more than I gave her . ”
90755	90763	90764	90764	Merina	2471	“ Which was what , an STD ? ”
90777	90785	90786	90786	Tag	85	“ Hey , I am squeaky clean . ”
90789	90809	90786	90786	Tag	85	“ Which I assume you would assume given the way you practically threw Taylor into my arms last night . ”
90836	90856	90827	90827	Taylor	254	“ But enough about me . You two seem to be taking your roles as husband and wife seriously . ”
90857	90861	90862	90862	Reese	377	“ Do n’t . ”
90893	90895	90897	90897	husband	2309	“ roles ”
90998	91004	91006	91006	he	71	“ for an older guy , ”

91148	91153	91154	91154	she	2471	“ Morning , everyone , ”
91248	91252	91253	91253	Reese	377	“ Good run ? ”
91274	91281	91286	91286	Rhona	252	“ Yeah . Rhona pushes me . ”
91293	91298	91299	91299	Alex	69	“ I have news , ”
91346	91369	91317	91317	she	252	“ Bob called me while I was jogging and told me the board is not interested in any new candidates for CEO . ”
91401	91413	91317	91317	she	252	“ Congratulations , son . They ’re naming you next week . ”
91417	91426	91427	91427	Alex	69	“ Well done . To both of you , ”
91497	91502	91503	91503	Tag	85	“ Nice fucking work . ”

92361	92379	92380	92381	Good Lord	162	“ You do n’t have to announce she ’s here , Bobbie . Just let her in . ”
92389	92394	92380	92381	Good Lord	162	“ Yes , sir . ”
92465	92474	92475	92475	He	69	“ To what do I owe this honor ? ”
92485	92491	92492	92492	She	53	“ For your trophy room . ”
92510	92519	92520	92520	He	69	“ I do n’t have a trophy room . ”

92834	92842	92843	92843	She	53	“ You ’re very hands - on . ”
92851	92859	92843	92843	She	53	“ Which you have enjoyed many times . ”
92954	92964	92965	92965	Her	53	“ Do n’t go mushy on me , Crane . ”
93020	93026	93027	93027	he	69	“ Not capable of mush , ”
93046	93071	93027	93027	he	69	“ Tell me , Merina . Have you ever harbored a fantasy about having sex with the CEO of Crane Hotels in his office ? ”
93176	93181	93182	93182	he	69	“ Are they purple ? ”
93200	93204	93205	93205	Her	53	“ They are . ”

93278	93292	93266	93266	Merina	2471	“ We should do what we do best , do n’t you think ? ”
93293	93297	93298	93298	She	2471	“ I do . ”
93383	93387	93388	93388	she	2471	“ Tell me , ”

93423	93426	93427	93427	He	69	“ Definitely . ”
93432	93471	93427	93427	He	69	“ I wo n’t ask if you ’ve ever had sex in this office because I do n’t want to know . I could still be your first as the man in charge , which counts for something . ”
93472	93481	93482	93482	He	69	“ It ’s a first on both counts . ”
93495	93507	93508	93508	He	69	“ You ’re a lot of firsts for me , Merina . ”
93513	93519	93520	93520	Her	2471	“ My first hostile takeover . ”

94710	94754	94755	94755	He	69	“ I needed you , Merina . I ’ve wanted CEO for as long as I can remember . Crane Hotels is in my blood . This company is my lifeline , my legacy . If Crane Hotels had gone to someone else … ”
94760	94767	94755	94755	He	69	“ It ’s my worst nightmare . ”
94801	94820	94786	94786	Merina	2471	“ I used to see Crane Hotels as big and impersonal . Cold without personality . Like you . ”
94821	94824	94825	94825	He	69	“ Ouch . ”
94828	94839	94840	94840	Her	2471	“ I was wrong about you . About this hotel . ”
94852	94897	94898	94898	She	2471	“ You love this place the way I love the Van Heusen . It shows in the way you traded your life to live here . To oversee every part . To put yourself on the line and do whatever it took for CEO . ”
94904	94917	94898	94898	She	2471	“ You were n’t going to let it go without a fight . ”

94965	94976	94977	94977	he	69	“ Was it all it was cracked up to be ? ”

96800	96817	96818	96818	Penelope	121	“ I ’m guessing you did n’t check your e - mail or my text messages , ”
96821	96824	96771	96771	Penelope	121	“ Pen — ”
96825	96843	96787	96787	he	1846	“ There ’s no time . Are you near a television ? Your segment is up next . ”
96844	96847	96771	96771	Penelope	121	“ My — ”

97065	97093	97023	97025	the news anchor	904	“ Hard telling how the news has hit Reese ’s current wife , Merina , seen here leaving a coffee shop wearing an oversize pair of sunglasses … ”
97121	97164	97023	97025	the news anchor	904	“ Gwyneth did remove the photo from Twitter sometime this morning , but since then has tweeted the following message : ‘ I regret nothing , including the four years I spent with Reese Crane . # ReesesRocket , # Loveofmylife . ’ ”
97223	97231	97232	97232	she	121	“ Not as bad as I thought , ”
97235	97241	97242	97242	he	2447	“ Is that a joke ? ”
97248	97256	97242	97242	he	2447	“ I ’m naked on national television . ”
97257	97311	97312	97312	Penelope	121	“ This is a small matter of spin . We ’ll say your desperate ex - girlfriend is having marital problems . I already briefed Merina , so she ’s prepared for a possible run - in with the press . If you happen to run into a reporter , just remember to … ”
97377	97387	97358	97358	He	2447	“ Mr. Crane , did you want me to — ”
97388	97393	97394	97394	he	2447	“ Turn it off , ”
97401	97404	97394	97394	he	2447	“ Thanks . ”

97606	97618	97619	97619	She	2471	“ I ’m more of a stationary bike kind of girl . ”
97638	97647	97619	97619	She	2471	“ At the gym at the Van Heusen . ”
97648	97655	97667	97667	she	2471	“ So why are you running ? ”
97691	97700	97701	97701	she	2471	“ I thought it would calm me down , ”

97805	97813	97814	97814	she	2471	“ It was serious between you two , ”
97817	97822	97814	97814	she	2471	“ You and Gwyneth . ”

97885	97909	97874	97874	She	2471	“ I do n’t have the patience to let you poke me with a stick until I respond the way you ’d like . ”
97915	97923	97874	97874	She	2471	“ You were in love with her . ”
98006	98026	98027	98027	She	2471	“ Why did you let me believe she was just a girl you dated for a handful of months ? ”
98042	98075	98076	98076	She	2471	“ Did she live here with you ? Is that why you never came back to the mansion ? Did she sleep with you in the bedroom you refuse to talk about ? ”
98089	98104	98105	98105	Reese	377	“ I see that you ’re under the assumption we ’re talking about this . ”
98149	98169	98170	98170	She	2471	“ Why wo n’t you tell me the truth ? What is it you ’re so desperate to hide ? ”
98200	98206	98191	98191	Penelope	121	“ rolling off her back . ”

98303	98328	98294	98294	His	2094	“ Silly me to have thought things changed since the night at your father ’s . Since the night in your office . Since — ”
98329	98346	98347	98347	Reese	377	“ I ’m broken , Merina ! Okay ? Is that what you want to hear ? ”
98379	98394	98294	98294	His	2094	“ Yes . I do want to hear it . I want to know . ”
98395	98401	98402	98402	he	2094	“ You want to know , ”
98408	98439	98402	98402	he	2094	“ There is a reason I had to draw up a contract to force someone to marry me for show . I ’m not equipped to do it for real . ”

98488	98493	98494	98494	he	2094	“ It ’s true , ”
98497	98552	98494	98494	he	2094	“ After Gwyneth , I vowed never to stay at this house . She made me look like a grade A jackass . Humiliated me in front of my father , my coworkers , and anyone who suspected she ’d dropped me for Hayes . It ’s not an easy thing to recover from . ”
98553	98556	98586	98586	his	2094	“ Reese — ”
98557	98571	98572	98572	He	2094	“ Have you forgotten the purpose of that ring being on your hand ? ”
98590	98617	98645	98645	She	2094	“ The deal : My being appointed to CEO in exchange for not tearing your family ’s hotel to the studs . It never included more . ”
98631	98644	98645	98645	She	2094	“ Do you know what I told your father at the cookout ? ”
98710	98727	98728	98728	he	2094	“ I told Mark I was giving you control of the Van Heusen as a surprise , ”
98731	98762	98728	98728	he	2094	“ That ’s what he asked me at the cookout . If I was planning on continuing the remodel , or if I ’d give you control of the hotel . ”
98763	98769	98770	98770	she	2094	“ That took some nerve , ”
98784	98790	98791	98791	Reese	377	“ The papers are ready , ”
98794	98804	98791	98791	Reese	377	“ It ’s a done deal once you sign . ”
98805	98819	98836	98836	him	2094	“ I thought … the Van Heusen was part of the divorce settlement … ”
98820	98823	98791	98791	Reese	377	“ Surprise . ”
98841	98844	98845	98845	She	2094	“ Hey . ”
98866	98871	98857	98857	Reese	377	“ Talk to me . ”
98872	98880	98857	98857	Reese	377	“ There ’s nothing else to say . ”
98881	98885	98886	98886	She	2094	“ There is . ”
98915	98936	98906	98906	She	2094	“ I had an ex - boyfriend who … well , he lived with me in my parents ’ house . ”
98967	99004	98937	98937	Reese	377	“ I told myself I loved him , and I guess in a way I did . He took advantage of me . He used me . Emptied my bank account and left with my money . ”
99013	99020	99008	99008	he	1892	“ I can replace the cash . ”
99021	99025	99028	99028	his	1892	“ You could . ”
99050	99095	99096	99096	She	2094	“ I do n’t care about the cash . I did , but I do n’t now . He made off with my pride , and that ’s hard to find once you ’ve lost it . I understand what Gwyneth put you through . ”
99103	99109	99096	99096	She	2094	“ I ’ve been there . ”
99110	99117	99118	99118	His	1892	“ Why do people do that ? ”
99132	99147	99127	99127	He	1892	“ Pretend they understand what you ’re going through . Like when someone dies . ”
99156	99189	99224	99224	he	1892	“ You do n’t know what it was like , Merina . You are n’t a man who strived to be great and had a setback that could cost him his destiny . ”
99190	99194	99195	99195	She	2094	“ Excuse me ? ”
99199	99205	99195	99195	She	2094	“ You took my destiny ! ”
99206	99222	99224	99224	he	1892	“ I bought it . And now you have it back . You ’re whole . ”
99229	99274	99275	99275	She	2094	“ You know why no one ‘ understands ’ you , Crane ? Because you do n’t bother sharing . If you opened your mouth to do something other than get me off , we might have the occasional conversation and understand each other ! ”
99285	99300	99275	99275	She	2094	“ Your pain does n’t outweigh mine because you ca n’t talk about it . ”
99301	99325	99326	99326	Reese	377	“ Fine . You want to talk ? You want to devolve what we have into messy relationship territory ? I ’ll talk . ”
99334	99413	99326	99326	Reese	377	“ I was in love with her , okay ? I found out she was fucking my best friend , and for the second time in my life , my thoughts bordered on suicidal . The only time I ever felt that way was when my mother died . I thought I ’d outgrown it , yet here I was in a big house I owned , the weight of a future company on my shoulders . In an instant”—he
99424	99435	99326	99326	Reese	377	point—“I was fifteen again . Unsure . Scared . Desperate . ”
99459	99490	99441	99441	She	2471	“ I vowed never to set foot in this house again . Every room reminded me of Gwyneth . I made plans to build a life with her and she … ”
99517	99538	99441	99441	She	2471	“ I was willing to risk my future , the company I am now running , to pander to love . ”
99584	99587	99588	99588	Reese	377	“ inconvenient . ”
99606	99615	99616	99616	Reese	377	“ That future existed only in my imagination , ”
99624	99651	99616	99616	Reese	377	“ What about your new future ? You have a chance at something here … We have a chance to build on what we ’ve started . ”
99652	99657	99616	99616	Reese	377	“ No , Merina . ”
99665	99734	99616	99616	Reese	377	“ Seeing my photo splashed on television was more than inconvenient and embarrassing . It was a reminder of a very important decision I made . The reason I dated random women and broke it off after one date for the last five years was because I never want to feel like that again . That ’s why our arrangement is and always was going to be temporary . ”
99764	99767	99749	99749	she	377	“ contract . ”
99768	99791	99792	99792	He	2460	“ Women are temporary . Gwyneth was temporary . Those one - night stands ? Each one as forgettable as the last . ”
99805	99808	99749	99749	she	377	“ Reese — ”
99809	99815	99792	99792	He	2460	“ And so are we . ”
99859	99869	99870	99870	She	377	“ Goddammit , Reese , do n’t do this . ”
99909	99960	99900	99900	she	377	“ You ca n’t tell me out of all the times we slept together , you never once wondered if we might work out . You ca n’t tell me you never thought ‘ what if ? ’ You can’t … because I was there , Reese . I was … ”
100031	100035	100027	100027	He	162	“ what if ? ”
100065	100072	100073	100073	His	162	“ I ’m getting a shower . ”
100079	100099	100073	100073	His	162	“ I ’ll sleep in the guest bedroom so you do n’t have to worry about me bothering you . ”

111097	111103	111081	111081	He	2057	“ What are you doing ? ”
111117	111120	111104	111104	He	2057	“ Reese ? ”
111121	111142	111104	111104	He	2057	“ You still love me . I was n’t sure until I walked in , but I can see it . ”
111227	111232	111233	111233	she	2471	“ I do n’t , ”
111236	111242	111243	111243	he	2057	“ Yes , you do , ”
111262	111310	111311	111311	He	2057	“ You were right . I am a chickenshit . Too terrified to try , so I thought cutting us short would be less painful . But it ’s not painful , Merina . It ’s worse . I have n’t felt a goddamn thing in weeks . ”
111325	111334	111322	111322	her	2471	“ Until right now . I feel this . ”
111368	111374	111375	111375	he	2057	“ Do you feel this ? ”

111483	111491	111492	111492	He	2057	“ Ca n’t what ? Love you ? ”
111506	111533	111492	111492	He	2057	“ Too late . I love you . I ’ve loved you even longer than I dared admit . And you still love me , Merina . ”

111593	111599	111586	111586	she	2471	“ It ’s not okay . ”
111616	111636	111610	111610	he	2057	“ I missed a board meeting today . I missed a lot of meetings . A lot of work . ”
111640	111736	111610	111610	he	2057	“ Laser focused on my legacy , I would have done anything to attain CEO . Like marry a woman and threaten to gut her hotel because I knew how much it meant to her . But now I have what I want , and without that woman by my side , my legacy means nothing . I was working so hard to fulfill my destiny , I failed to see that you , Merina , are a part of it . Without you , I have nothing . Without you , I am nothing . ”
111741	111750	111737	111737	She	2064	“ The day you stormed into my office with that”—he
111754	111807	111737	111737	She	2064	doorknob—“you changed me . I was never the same after you . But I ’m stubborn , and I ’m stupid . I let myself believe letting you go was better for both of us . No matter how much it hurt me , I knew you were better off without me . ”
111813	111822	111823	111823	He	2064	“ But you ’re not , are you ? ”
111829	111849	111823	111823	He	2064	“ Did I really break you , Merina ? Wo n’t you let me fix it ? Fix us ? ”
111850	111855	111856	111856	she	2064	“ I ’m terrified , ”
111866	111893	111856	111856	she	2064	“ I ’m so scared you ’ll freak out and leave again . I ca n’t take it . I wo n’t go through this again . ”
111894	111901	111925	111925	He	2064	“ You wo n’t have to . ”
111902	111909	111910	111910	She	2064	“ I do n’t know that . ”
111957	111964	111965	111965	he	2064	“ I need to be rebuilt , ”
111968	111971	111965	111965	he	2064	“ Sorry ? ”
111972	111978	111979	111979	He	2064	“ Like the Van Heusen . ”
112016	112054	112007	112007	He	2064	“ I was gutted before I met you . I was a shell , my foundation shaky . I ’m better than the man you met the first time . Because of you , I ’m better . ”
112084	112091	112092	112092	she	2064	“ I ca n’t fix you , ”
112095	112105	112106	112106	Reese	377	“ I do n’t want you to fix me , ”
112109	112165	112106	112106	Reese	377	“ I want you to stand beside me . You see beauty in this place , and you made me see it too . You see charm where there are cracks . I ’m cracked in a hundred places , but the biggest one happened when I saw your ring on top of those papers . ”
112241	112247	112248	112248	she	2064	“ You ’re a mess , ”
112252	112259	112260	112260	His	2068	“ I ’m on the mend . ”
112299	112312	112319	112319	her	2064	“ You can rise from the ashes on your own , Reese . ”
112376	112383	112373	112373	he	2068	“ I found home with you . ”
112409	112457	112458	112458	He	2068	“ Home was a safe place when my mom was alive . Then she died and I never found it again . Not with dad and my brothers . Family , trust , love , yes . But not home . That place you feel safe naked . ”
112466	112469	112458	112458	He	2068	“ Figuratively . ”
112477	112512	112513	112513	He	2068	“ The mansion was never more than a place to live . Once I left it behind and moved to the hotel , I forgot about needing a space where I could be me . ”
112523	112527	112513	112513	He	2068	“ Until you . ”
112537	112581	112528	112528	She	377	“ We built more than a business , Merina . We accomplished more than fooling the world . We made a house into a home . I want that with you . But this time , a safe space for both of us . ”
112582	112587	112588	112588	she	377	“ To be naked , ”
112591	112594	112528	112528	She	377	“ Preferably . ”
112603	112611	112612	112612	He	2068	“ Come home with me , Merina . ”
112617	112624	112612	112612	He	2068	“ For tonight . For good . ”
112707	112711	112712	112712	he	2068	“ Come back . ”
112722	112742	112712	112712	he	2068	“ Come back and I swear I ’ll spend the rest of my life making this up to you . ”
112791	112794	112764	112765	a man	413	“ Okay . ”
112795	112798	112799	112799	His	413	“ Okay ? ”
112850	112856	112857	112857	she	377	“ Come on , Crane , ”
112860	112865	112857	112857	she	377	“ Take me home . ”
112955	112961	112962	112962	Reese	377	“ What are you doing ? ”
112970	112977	112978	112978	she	377	“ Hashtag love of my life , ”
112981	112986	112987	112987	His	413	“ Get in here . ”
113009	113015	113016	113016	he	413	“ Let ’s see it , ”
113063	113072	113073	113073	He	413	“ I ca n’t wait to marry you . ”
113078	113081	113082	113082	He	413	“ Again . ”
113110	113114	113115	113115	He	413	“ Thank you . ”
113120	113123	113102	113102	She	377	“ For ? ”
113124	113129	113130	113130	He	413	“ For making me . ”
113141	113153	113130	113130	He	413	“ They say behind every good man is a strong woman . ”
113154	113173	113182	113182	She	377	“ I think the saying goes ‘ Behind every good man is a woman rolling her eyes . ’ ”
113174	113181	113130	113130	He	413	“ Well , I was close . ”
113205	113214	113201	113201	she	377	“ Oh ! I forgot to tell you . ”
113225	113242	113215	113215	He	413	“ I decided to have a team of decorators tackle that whitewashed lobby of Crane Hotel . ”
113243	113247	113215	113215	He	413	“ You what ? ”
113248	113253	113254	113254	she	377	“ Bo - ring , ”
113257	113276	113254	113254	she	377	“ When they ’re done , your glass and stone shrine will be Bohemian and full of personality . ”
113277	113284	113285	113285	His	413	“ I do n’t like personality . ”
113300	113312	113294	113294	she	377	“ I should confirm we would like the tapestries after all . ”
113322	113328	113313	113313	She	377	“ And the beaded curtains . ”
113329	113338	113339	113339	He	413	“ Merina , you ’d better be kidding . ”
113356	113373	113347	113347	She	377	“ Do you think the addition of bean bag chairs in the lobby is too much ? ”
113401	113428	113429	113429	He	413	“ Only if you promise to have a Tarot reader present on Saturdays . No live chickens , though , it ’ll freak out the suits . ”
113444	113453	113454	113454	She	377	“ I had you going , admit it . ”
113457	113463	113454	113454	She	377	“ I ’ll admit nothing . ”
113464	113474	113475	113475	She	377	“ You ’ll tell me everything , Reese Crane . ”
113492	113502	113503	113503	He	413	“ Let ’s try you saying my name again . ”
113512	113523	113503	113503	He	413	“ Only this time louder , and with more enthusiasm . ”
113578	113587	113592	113592	she	377	“ I love you , Merina Van Heusen . ”
113605	113613	113592	113592	she	377	“ I love you , Reese Crane . ”
