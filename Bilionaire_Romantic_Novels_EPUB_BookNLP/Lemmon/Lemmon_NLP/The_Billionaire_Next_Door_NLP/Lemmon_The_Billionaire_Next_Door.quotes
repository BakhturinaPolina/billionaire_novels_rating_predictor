56243	56247	56248	56248	He	416	“ Is it ? ”
56276	56282	56272	56272	She	1109	“ I ’m not answering that ”
56319	56325	56326	56326	she	1109	“ These drinks are huge , ”
56356	56362	56363	56363	He	416	“ Cranes do n’t skimp . ”
56378	56406	56407	56407	Her	1109	“ Maybe you should consider sizing them down . It would help for repeat business , and in this heat , keep everyone with a cold beverage . ”
56426	56434	56417	56417	He	416	“ You do n’t waste any time . ”
56435	56443	56444	56444	She	1109	“ This is why I ’m here . ”
56463	56470	56471	56471	He	416	“ What else did you notice ? ”
56504	56507	56487	56487	he	416	“ Um . ”
56519	56564	56565	56565	She	1109	“ The layout of the bar is n’t conducive to this many guests . Even with the swim - up bar open , patrons will probably choose not to drink or they ’ll sneak in their own liquor rather than wait in the line . ”
56617	56634	56609	56609	they	1101	“ Clearly , you do n’t have a staff problem . They ’re efficient , friendly . ”
56635	56651	56652	56652	He	416	“ They are . Karina ’s been here from the start . Hired her myself . ”
56657	56662	56663	56663	Rachel	52	“ She watches you . ”
56680	56689	56663	56663	Rachel	52	“ Did you two … ? Never mind . ”
56741	56751	56752	56752	she	52	“ I ’m going to work a few shifts , ”
56760	56766	56767	56767	he	416	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
56778	56787	56752	56752	she	52	“ Oh , I wo n’t take tips . ”
56788	56791	56752	56752	she	52	“ Rachel … ”
56792	56835	56752	56752	she	52	“ Absolutely not . You ’re letting me stay in your room . I did n’t pay for this drink . The least you can let me do is what I promised to do , which is help you improve the bar . ”
56836	56864	56867	56867	he	1121	“ I did n’t bring you here to put you behind the bar , Dimples . I want you to advise , not work your ass off . ”
56879	56886	56867	56867	he	1121	“ I want you with me . ”
56946	56951	56952	56952	she	1121	“ I appreciate that , ”
56960	56982	56952	56952	she	1121	“ But to know how things work from the other side , I literally need to be on the other side . ”
56983	57007	57008	57008	He	1121	“ Fine . I ’ll pair you with Karina for training . She ’s the best , and you ’re a fast learner . ”
57014	57018	57008	57008	He	1121	“ One night . ”
57019	57022	57023	57023	she	1121	“ Two , ”
57093	57113	57124	57124	She	52	“ One night and one day . It ’d help to see how things go during a weekend afternoon . ”
57119	57123	57114	57114	He	416	“ Fair enough . ”
57177	57182	57183	57183	he	416	“ But not tonight , ”
57203	57209	57196	57196	His	416	“ Tonight you ’re mine . ”
57274	57281	57282	57282	she	180	“ Dinner with a luau included , ”
57289	57295	57282	57282	she	180	“ That ’s a first . ”
57296	57306	57307	57307	He	416	“ I like when you have firsts with me . ”
57338	57345	57346	57346	Dimples	124	“ Now what do we do ? ”
57431	57443	57444	57444	He	124	“ I arranged surfing lessons for tomorrow before your evening shift . ”
57459	57473	57474	57474	She	180	“ Is that what you were doing while I was dressing for dinner ? ”
57485	57490	57491	57491	He	124	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
57511	57521	57491	57491	He	124	“ Too much of a city girl for surfing ? ”
57522	57548	57549	57549	She	180	“ I ’m from a farm , thank you very much . I mean , sort of . We did n’t have cows or anything . ”
57567	57593	57549	57549	She	180	“ I ’m not sure if working after a surfing lesson is smart . I ’ll probably need a massage after I bust my ass . ”
57594	57600	57601	57601	He	124	“ That can be arranged . ”
57660	57685	57652	57652	He	124	“ Tag Crane , you brought me here to do a job , not play . Do n’t you want me to do it ? ”
57699	57703	57693	57693	he	124	“ Not really . ”
57751	57771	57772	57772	He	124	“ Now that I have you here , I do n’t want to let you out of my sight . ”
57875	57889	57890	57890	she	52	“ You have to let me work while I ’m here , Tag , ”
57922	57937	57911	57911	He	124	“ I already feel guilty that you wo n’t let me pay for anything . ”
57938	57943	57944	57944	He	124	“ Shit , Rachel . ”
57947	57950	57951	57951	she	52	“ What ? ”
57964	57983	57993	57993	he	124	“ Has n’t a guy ever treated you well ? Bought you things just because he wanted to ? ”
58044	58051	58052	58052	she	52	“ I have my own money , ”
58086	58092	58080	58080	He	124	“ Stop being so stubborn . ”
58093	58100	58080	58080	He	124	“ I ’m not being stubborn ! ”
58105	58111	58112	58112	He	124	“ She says , stubbornly . ”
58152	58166	58167	58167	he	124	“ You ’d give me your ideas for free , would n’t you ? ”
58184	58197	58172	58172	She	52	“ I ’d tell you what I thought without compensation , yes . ”
58198	58208	58172	58172	She	52	“ Your opinions have worth . You have worth . ”
58236	58249	58250	58250	Tag	416	“ You do n’t have to earn the right to be here . ”
58277	58288	58274	58274	she	52	“ I ’m still going to work behind the bar . ”
58289	58292	58293	58293	He	416	“ Figures . ”
58316	58330	58331	58331	His	416	“ I ’ve been waiting to take you back to bed all day . ”
58377	58389	58372	58372	him	416	“ How much longer are you going to make me wait ? ”
58390	58398	58399	58399	She	52	“ You promised me a beachside stroll . ”
58413	58420	58421	58421	he	416	“ A little longer , then , ”
58424	58435	58372	58372	him	416	“ You ’re the one who wants to know me . ”
58436	58449	58455	58455	She	52	“ I do . You actually going to tell me about yourself ? ”
58461	58470	58455	58455	She	52	“ I ’ll talk . I ’ll talk . ”
58475	58496	58455	58455	She	52	“ Fine . But after this ‘ stroll ’ of ours , it ’s straight to heaven via my mattress . ”
58505	58509	58497	58497	Her	52	“ I accept . ”
58510	58522	58523	58523	He	416	“ Let ’s get to know each other , Rachel Foster . ”
58572	58575	58576	58576	he	416	“ Parents ? ”
58593	58596	58597	58597	He	416	“ Two . ”
58613	58640	58597	58597	He	416	“ Still married . Still in love . They live in a small town in Ohio outside of Columbus . They consider Chicago the big time . ”
58641	58649	58610	58610	her	52	“ Why did you come to Chicago ? ”
58650	58659	58660	58660	Her	52	“ I wanted to escape Derby , Ohio . ”

58903	58931	58888	58888	He	1140	“ Just remember , the girl for you will challenge everything you think you know about yourself . That ’s how you know she ’s a keeper . ”
58955	58973	58974	58974	Rachel	52	“ I ca n’t imagine how hard losing her must have been for you and your brothers . ”

59128	59168	59018	59018	He	1140	“ I want you here because I value your opinion and trust your instincts . And because I have n’t been able to stop thinking about you since the second you opened Oliver ’s door wearing polar bear pajamas . ”

67577	67608	67609	67609	she	52	“ If you push back the bar rather than have it in the center of the two pools , you could create a place for the guests to hang out , ”
67613	67641	67609	67609	she	52	“ Milling around would be easier if they were n’t in danger of slipping into the swimming pools by taking a step to the left or right . ”
67688	67712	67713	67713	She	52	“ Even with the swim - up open again , you ’ll increase your ability for more traffic if the bar is elsewhere . ”
67721	67762	67713	67713	She	52	“ And I was right about the setup . Your server ’s wells are too far apart . You need one designated area , and preferably one bartender who prioritizes the servers and helps the other two bartenders during downtime . ”
67779	67820	67763	67763	She	52	“ Once you have it redesigned , I ’m betting you can use this as a template for some of your other hotels . I know Hawaii is a different setup given there are multiple pools , but I think … ”
67830	67833	67821	67821	She	52	“ What ? ”
67854	67861	67834	67834	He	416	“ Nothing . I ’m listening . ”

67977	67990	67963	67963	He	416	“ Why ’d you leave marketing for the glam life of bartending ? ”
67998	68007	67991	67991	Her	52	“ Just … It was time to go . ”
68008	68011	67991	67991	Her	52	“ Why ? ”
68020	68023	67991	67991	Her	52	“ Truth ? ”

68194	68203	68122	68122	Tag	416	“ So what do you want to do ? ”
68269	68278	68279	68279	he	416	“ Do you see yourself in marketing again ? ”
68290	68298	68299	68299	She	1229	“ Not really . I like bartending . ”
68308	68322	68299	68299	She	1229	“ I liked sharing this project with you . It ’s been fun . ”
68339	68370	68371	68371	She	1229	“ But joining another corporate circus ? I do n’t know . Employees can be vindictive . Each out to stomp on other people in their race to the top . ”
68378	68426	68371	68371	She	1229	“ Bartending is one for all , all for one . You band together and do the job . Survive the rush . Make tips . Split the bar so you make sure each bartender is waiting on the person they ’ll extract the most money from . ”

100205	100209	100215	100215	Bree	59	“ I guess . ”
100218	100241	100215	100215	Bree	59	“ You have a fancy job , and a fancy life , and soon you ’ll be married and living in Tuscany . ”
100242	100250	100215	100215	Bree	59	“ I do n’t even like Tuscany . ”

100363	100375	100360	100360	Rachel	52	“ I do n’t think he ’s in love with me . ”
100386	100393	100376	100376	Bree	59	“ Why would you say that ? ”
100394	100403	100404	100404	He	1301	“ Because he flew to Hawaii yesterday morning . ”
100431	100434	100422	100422	Bree	59	“ So ? ”
100435	100472	100376	100376	Bree	59	“ So ? He ’s been acting downright twitchy since he offered his penthouse as my home away from home , and then yesterday he was bouncing off the walls because he was going to Hawaii . ”
100473	100492	100422	100422	Bree	59	“ Well , it is Hawaii . And you should n’t be surprised . His job requires traveling . ”
100493	100505	100506	100506	Rachel	52	“ I know he travels . Traveling is not the issue . ”
100516	100537	100506	100506	Rachel	52	“ I ’m excited to hear from him already . Like , I ’m already waiting for him to call . ”
100538	100546	100547	100547	Bree	59	“ That ’s because you love him . ”
100576	100631	100646	100646	Rachel	52	“ He has been gone less than a day , and I miss him so much my chest hurts . I ca n’t help but remember how much I depended on Shaun and how he ended up leaving . Tag has n’t given me any indication we ’ll stay together for the long haul . ”
100632	100645	100708	100710	Lucas ’s wife	1689	“ Do you want to stay with him for the long haul ? ”
100670	100680	100681	100681	Bree	59	“ But he has n’t asked you to leave , ”
100684	100697	100698	100698	Rachel	52	“ No , he ’s been intensely polite about my being there , ”
100749	100777	100740	100740	he	416	“ Shaun slowly cut me loose , too , Bree . Months and months passed by before things imploded . I ca n’t let that happen again . ”
100806	100809	100810	100810	Bree	59	“ Rach . ”
100817	100886	100810	100810	Bree	59	“ It makes sense for you to be nervous about where things are heading . Love is big and scary . You ’re both probably adjusting . I ’ve seen you with him , and I ’ve seen the way he looks at you . He looks like a man in love to me . Maybe he has n’t admitted it yet . To himself or to you . ”
100927	100936	100937	100937	Bree	59	“ Once he calls you ’ll feel better , ”
100940	100965	100937	100937	Bree	59	“ I ’ve said this before , but it bears repeating . Tag is not Shaun . He ’s not plotting your corporate demise . ”
101137	101140	101141	101141	She	59	“ Hi . ”

101241	101258	101224	101224	He	416	“ I do . I wanted to call and check in . Have everything you need ? ”

101357	101387	101308	101308	His	416	“ I think so , but that ’s not the news . I ’m standing on a patch of ground where there will someday be a new Crane Hotel . ”
101388	101395	101396	101396	He	416	“ Did you buy the land ? ”
101408	101458	101308	101308	His	416	“ Not yet , but the Realtor is on his way , and I ’m going to tell him yes . I already called Reese . It ’s perfect . I can envision the direction the hotel will face , where the bars will go — maybe your designs . ”
101481	101486	101487	101487	she	1705	“ That ’s great , ”
101574	101584	101585	101585	she	1705	“ I had a proposition for you , actually , ”

And , Dimples , do n’t forget , the moving company is scheduled to be at your apartment this afternoon . Make sure they get everything they ’re supposed to into storage for you , okay ? ”
102014	102017	102018	102018	she	520	“ Sure , ”

103401	103405	103406	103406	she	52	“ You did , ”
103410	103503	103406	103406	she	52	“ In a million subtle ways . The way you left for Hawaii after I ’d stayed with you for a few days . The way you have kept me as close as possible in bed , but as far as possible elsewhere . I ’m not angry , Tag . I ’m not . And this is a good thing for you . You ’re off the hook . For the wedding . For the future . It ’s better for both of us if we do n’t drag this out . ”
