1490	1531	1413	1413	her	2035	okay?"The phone clicked . I was anxious and trembling , the air - conditioned breeze glancing off my neck and making me shiver . A baby , I thought miserably . Tara 's baby . I trudged into the kitchen . "
1536	1540	1413	1413	her	2035	" I said , "
1554	1590	1413	1413	her	2035	"Dane had taken the skillet off the burner . He was pouring something bright orange into a martini glass . Turning , he handed it to me , his green eyes warm with friendly sympathy . "
1594	1606	1413	1413	her	2035	"I took a swallow of gingery - sweet gruel and grimaced . "
1623	1630	1609	1609	I	970	" I set aside the glass . "
1645	2075	1639	1639	I	970	"As I looked into Dane 's concerned face , the calmness of him , the sanity of him , was like being wrapped in a soft blanket . He was casually handsome , blond , and lean , with the perpetual toasted - and - salted scruffiness of someone who had just come in from the beach . Most of the time Dane dressed in denim and hemp and enviro - sandals , as if he were perpetually ready for a spontaneous trip to some equatorial region . If you 'd asked Dane to describe his perfect vacation , it would have been some survivalist trek through an exotic jungle , equipped with only a nylon water bag and a pocket knife . Although Dane had never met my mother or sister , I had told him a lot about them , furtively unearthing memories like fragile artifacts . It was n't easy to talk about my past , any part of it . I had managed to trust Dane with the basics : my parents had divorced and my father had left us when I was five . All I heard of my dad after that was that he had gotten a new wife , new children , and there was no place for Tara and me in his second time around . Regardless of his failure as a dad , I could hardly blame him for wanting to escape . It bothered me , however , that my father knew what kind of parent he had left us alone with . Maybe he reasoned that daughters were better off with their mothers . Maybe he had hoped my mother would get better over time . Or maybe he feared one or both of his daughters would turn out exactly like her , and that was not something he could handle . There had been no significant man in my life until I had met Dane at the University of Texas . He was always gentle , reading my signals , never demanding too much . He made me feel safe for the first time ever . And yet for all that , there was something missing between us , something that nagged at me like a pebble that had worked its way into my shoe . Whatever that missing thing was , it kept Dane and me from reaching absolute closeness . As we stood in the apartment kitchen , Dane put a warm hand on my shoulder . The shaky - cold feeling began to subside . "

2151	2166	2142	2142	I	970	" I do n't think she 's given much thought to anything beyond that . ""No

2211	2246	2170	2171	Tara is?"I	364	" Dane had started his own environmental monitoring equipment company , and business was expanding almost too fast for him to handle . It would be difficult for him to take the time off . "

6248	6356	6226	6226	Tara	364	"I opened the folder and found a piece of notebook paper on top . The sight of my sister 's handwriting , all loopy and uneven , was painfully familiar . The words had been dug deep by a ballpoint pen that had nearly perforated the paper with its desperate force . Dear Mom , I have to go somewhere and figure things out . I do n't know when I 'll be back . I hereby give you or my sister Ella the authority to take care of my baby and be his guardian until I 'm ready to come get him . Sincerely , Tara Sue Varner"Hereby
6358	6389	6390	6390	I	970	" I murmured with a wretched smile , leaning my forehead on my hand . My sister had probably thought a legal - sounding word would make it more official . "
6421	6454	6455	6455	Luke	2045	"Sorting through the contents of the folder , I found the birth certificate . No father listed . The baby was exactly a week old , and his name was Luke Varner . "

6474	6489	6470	6470	we	466	Luke?"Mom went to the refrigerator and pulled out a can of Diet Big Red . "

6682	6703	6704	6704	She	2035	" Mom poured the Big Red over ice , watching the pink foam rise to the rim of the glass . "
6719	6733	6716	6716	I	970	""Maybe this is some kind of postpartum problem . She may need antidepressants . "Mom
6744	6761	6716	6716	I	970	" Does n't matter what pills you give her . She 'll never want that baby . "
6776	6791	6773	6773	she	2035	" She 's not cut out for having kids any more than I was . ""Why
6799	6804	6797	6797	Mom	2035	" I asked softly . "It
6856	6955	6958	6958	Mom	2035	"I could n't begin to reply I had no way to describe how I had struggled to collect every good memory possible . How every moment of my mother 's affection — a hug , a bedtime story — had been a gift from heaven . But mostly how my childhood , and Tara 's , had seemed like a rug pulled out from under us . And how her complete lack of motherly instinct — even the basic urge to protect her offspring — had made it difficult for Tara and me to have relationships with people . "I'm
6960	7007	6958	6958	Mom	2035	" I managed to say , my voice thick with regret . But I was fairly certain my mother did n't understand what I was sorry for . A high , mewling cry came from the bedroom . The sound chilled me . He needed something . "Time
7012	7022	7023	7023	I	970	" my mother said , going to the refrigerator . "
7035	7318	7033	7033	Ella	0	"Another cry , this one sharper . It made my back teeth hurt like I 'd just bitten into tin foil . I sped to the bedroom and saw a small form on the bed , wriggling like a baby seal . My heart went so fast that I could n't feel any spaces between the beats . I leaned over , reaching tentatively , uncertain how to pick him up . I was n't good with children . I had never wanted to hold my friends ' babies — they had never appealed to me . I slid my hands beneath the small flopping body . And the head . I knew you were supposed to support the head and neck . Somehow I gathered him up against me , his weight somehow fragile and solid at the same time , and the crying paused , and the infant looked up at me in a squinty Clint - Eastwood sort of way , and the crying started again . He was so unprotected . Helpless . I had only one coherent thought as I went to the kitchen , and it was that no one in my family , including me , should be trusted with one of these . I sat and clumsily readjusted Luke in my arms , and Mom brought a bottle to me . Cautiously I put the silicone nipple — which was n't shaped anything like a normal human one — against the tiny mouth . He latched on and went quiet , intent on feeding . I had n't realized I was holding my breath until I let it out with a sigh of relief . "You
7324	7328	7337	7337	him	480	" Mom said . "
7353	7658	7660	7660	he	481	"I clenched my teeth to hold back a burst of protests — this was n't fair . . . none of it was my fault . . . I was busy , too . . . I had my own life to get back to . But what kept me silent , aside from the knowledge that my mother did n't care , was the fact that the person who was really getting the raw deal was the one who could n't speak up for himself . Luke was a hot potato , doomed to be tossed back and forth until someone was forced to keep him . And then it occurred to me : what if the father was a cokehead or a criminal ? How many guys had Tara slept with , and was I going to have to track them all down and have them tested ? What if some of them refused ? Was I going to have to hire a lawyer?Oh , this was going to be fun . MOM SHOWED ME HOW TO BURP HIM AND TO CHANGE the diaper . Her competence surprised me , especially since she had never been a baby person , and it had undoubtedly been a long time since she had last done such a thing . I tried to picture her as a young mother , patiently attending to the never - ending tasks of caring for a baby . I could n't imagine she had enjoyed any of it . My mother , with only a baby for company , a needy , noisy , inarticulate creature . . . no , it was impossible to envision . I brought in my bags from the car , changed into my pajamas , and took the baby into the guest bedroom . "Where
7665	7680	7681	7681	him	481	" I asked , wondering what you did when there was no crib available . "Put
7689	7693	7681	7681	him	481	" Mom suggested . "But
7709	7717	7681	7681	him	481	""Then make a pallet on the floor . "

7751	7814	7815	7815	you	484	"While Luke waited in his plastic carrier , I made a pallet for both of us on the floor . I rolled up a quilt to make a bolster between us . Alter laying Luke on his back on one side of the pallet , I sat on the other side and flipped open my cell phone to call my cousin Liza . "Are

9009	9089	8997	8997	I	970	"We talked for a few more minutes , mostly about Jack Travis . Apparently he was a man 's man who hunted and fished , drove a little too fast , lived a little too hard . Women were lined up from Houston to Amarillo in hopes of being his next girlfriend . And from what Heidi had confided to Liza , Jack Travis would do absolutely anything in bed , and had an insane amount of stamina . In fact—"TMI

I wondered what his impression of life was after his first week in the world . A lot of coming and going , car rides , changing faces , different voices . He probably wanted his mother 's face , his mother 's tone . At his age , a little consistency was n't too much to ask . I cupped my hand lightly over the top of his skull , smoothing the black fluff . "
9376	9396	9238	9238	she	2035	" I told him , and flipped open the phone again . Dane picked up on the second ring . "

9703	10016	10017	10018	the baby	2045	" THREEIT WAS A MARK OF DANE 'S UNFAMILIARITY WITH babies that he had suggested , without irony , that I get a good night 's sleep . My nephew was a living , breathing sleep disorder . It was without exception the worst night I had ever spent , a series of harsh awakenings and crying and formula - mixing and feeding and burping and diaper - changing , and then after about five minutes of rest it all started again . I did n't know how anyone could live through months of this . After one night , I was a wreck . In the morning I showered , turning the water up to near - scalding in the hopes that it would ease my aching muscles . Wishing I 'd had the foresight to bring a more impressive outfit , I dressed in the only clean clothes I had : a pair of jeans , a fitted cotton shirt , and leather flats . I brushed my hair until it was neat and smooth , and looked at my haggard , stone - white face . My eyes were so irritated and dry that I did n't bother with my contact lenses . I decided to wear my glasses , a pair of sensible rectangular wire - rims . It did n't improve my mood when I went to the kitchen , bringing Luke in his carrier , and saw my mother sitting at the table . Her fingers were knobbed with rings , her hair curled and sprayed . She wore shorts , her legs smooth and tan , and one of the pedicured toes that peeped from her wedge sandals sparkled with a tiny crystal toe ring . I set Luke 's carrier on the floor at the other side of the table , away from her . "Does
10024	10028	10029	10029	His	2045	" I asked . "
10036	10041	10029	10029	His	2045	"Mom shook her head . "

10196	10221	10176	10176	I	970	" I did n't say it in an accusatory way . I did n't need to . Her slim body stiffened in the chair . "
10234	10240	10248	10248	her	364	""Because you 're a grandmother ? "
10254	10265	10241	10241	I	970	" Or because Tara was n't married when she had the baby?""Both
10293	10306	10307	10307	I	970	""Tara and I have n't been children for a while , Mom . "

10552	10578	10549	10549	I	970	" she said after a moment , reaching down to adjust her toe ring . A hint of satisfaction edged her tone as she added , "
10583	10735	10549	10549	I	970	"THE DAY WAS ALREADY BLAZING , I TOOK LUKE INTO the discount store , while he squalled up and down the aisles , writhing angrily in the ragged foam - lined infant seat that was bolted to the handles of the basket . Luke finally quieted when we left , soothed by the vibration of the basket wheels as they rattled over the rough asphalt of the parking lot . The outside air was roasting - hot , while the indoors ' were chilled by Arctic air - conditioning . As you went outside and inside , alternately sweating and drying , you were eventually covered in an invisible film of sticky salt . Luke and I were heated to the pink of boiled shrimp . And this was how I was going to meet Jack Travis . I called Liza , hoping she had managed to get his phone number . "Heidi
10743	10750	10757	10757	she	547	" Liza said , sounding disgruntled . "

11270	11278	11279	11279	I	970	"Someone 's coming down to meet us , "
11303	11314	11292	11292	I	970	" We had a little emergency ; is there a restroom nearby?"Blanching
11374	11379	11365	11365	we	577	"How old is she ? "
11393	11398	11399	11399	I	970	"It 's a he , "

11473	11638	11399	11399	I	970	" For the next several seconds , I brooded about how Tara might be getting around , if she was healing properly after giving birth . We reached the eleventh floor , and I carried Luke out of the elevator and past the doors of Travis Management Solutions . We went into a serene area decorated in natural colors , with a small grouping of contemporary upholstered furniture . I set down Luke 's carrier , rubbed my aching arm , and approached the receptionist . Her face was a polite mask . The black eyeliner on her upper lids had been extended so it formed little checkmarks at the corners of her eyes , as if they had been part of a list she had gone through that morning . Right eye ? . . . check . Left eye ? . . . check . I gave her a smile that I hoped conveyed that I was a woman of the world . "I
11647	11665	11667	11667	I	970	" I said , pushing up my glasses , which had started to slip down my nose , "

11714	11756	11704	11704	I	970	"Her face remained carefully expressionless . I half - expected her to reach under the desk and press a button for security . Any second now , men in beige polyester uniforms would burst through the doors and haul me off . "What

11870	11901	11902	11902	I	970	" Look , all I need is five minutes . I 'm here from Austin . I 'm dealing with a pressing matter that Mr. Travis needs to know about — "
11935	11942	11943	11944	the receptionist	2157	"You've got to keep him quiet , "
12014	12017	12018	12019	the receptionist	2157	"Miss Varner — "
12024	12029	12018	12019	the receptionist	2157	"His bottle 's cold . "
12037	12063	12032	12032	her	2157	" Before you send us off , would you mind warming it ? Just put it in a cup of hot water for a minute ? Please?"She
12072	12088	12089	12089	you	586	" Give it to me . I 'll take it back to the coffee station . ""Thank
12091	12129	12130	12130	Luke	2045	" I offered her a placating smile , which she ignored as she left . I wandered around the reception area , bouncing Luke gently , humming , doing anything I could think of to soothe him . "
12161	12411	12152	12152	I	970	"Aware of a figure approaching from one of the hallways that branched out from the reception area , I turned gratefully . I assumed it was the receptionist , back with the bottle . Instead I saw three men walking out , all dressed in dark , expensive - looking suits . One of them was fair and slim , the other short and a bit portly , and the third was the most striking man I had ever seen . He was tall and big - framed , all hard muscle and easy masculinity , with dark eyes and heavy well - cut black hair . The way he carried himself — the confidence in his walk , the relaxed set of his shoulders — proclaimed that he was accustomed to being in charge . Pausing in mid - conversation , he gave me an alert look , and my breath caught . A blush crept over my face , and a hectic pulse began at the front of my throat . One glance and I knew exactly who and what he was . The classic alpha male , the kind who had spurred evolution forward about five million years ago by nailing every female in sight . They charmed , seduced , and behaved like bastards , and yet women were biologically incapable of resisting their magic DNA.Still staring at me , the man spoke in a deep voice that raised goose - flesh on my arms . "
12421	12425	12426	12426	I	970	""Mr . Travis ? "
12443	12470	12437	12437	He	2035	"I hoped I might catch you between meetings . I 'm Ella . From Austin . Ella Varner . I need to talk to you briefly . "The
12482	12486	12487	12487	she	2035	" Oh God , "
12493	12499	12487	12487	she	2035	" Mr. Travis , I 'm sorry—""It
12503	12581	12487	12487	she	2035	" Travis said , gesturing for her to give me the bottle . I took it , shook a few lukewarm drops on my wrist as my mother had told me to do , and shoved the nipple into the baby 's mouth . Luke grunted in satisfaction and fell into a busy , sucking silence . Looking back up into Travis 's eyes , which were as dark and rich as blackstrap molasses , I asked , "
12590	12688	12583	12583	I	970	minutes?"Travis studied me thoughtfully . I was struck by the contradictions about him , the expensive clothes and bold good looks , the sense of unpolished edges . He was unapologetically masculine in a way that suggested you should either scramble to get on his good side or get the hell out of his way . I could n't help contrasting him with Dane , whose golden handsomeness and jaw - softening stubble had always been so soothing and approachable . There was nothing soothing about Jack Travis . Except maybe his deep sugar - maple baritone . "Depends
12690	12695	12583	12583	I	970	" Travis said easily . "
12705	12727	12696	12696	You	592	" He had a heavy Texas accent , the kind in which dropped G 's hit the floor like summer hailstones . "No

12775	12804	12766	12766	I	970	" And I should warn you that if you get rid of me now , you 'll have to deal with me later . I 'm very persistent . "The

12838	12849	12814	12814	he	970	" one of them said in a brisk British accent . "

13131	13143	13127	13128	Hello Kitty	119	" There was a distinct note of disapproval in his voice . "They
13153	13157	13127	13128	Hello Kitty	119	" I said . "You

13316	13321	13314	13314	Tara	364	" he finally said . "

13533	13548	13549	13549	You	606	"Despite the seriousness of the conversation , I wanted to smile at the phrase . "
13569	13582	13584	13584	you	606	""Thank you , professor . But I 'm still not the father . ""How
13586	13617	13584	13584	you	606	sure?""Because I never had sex with Tara . The night I took her out , she drank too much . And I do n't sleep with women in that condition . ""Really
13619	13624	13584	13584	you	606	" I said skeptically . "
13627	13682	13584	13584	you	606	" came the soft reply . Luke burped , and settled into the curve of my neck like a sack of pinto beans . I thought of what Liza had told me about Jack Travis 's hyperactive love life , his near - legendary womanizing , and I could n't prevent a cynical smile . "
13692	13697	13686	13690	a man of high principles	607	" I asked acidly . "No
13712	13783	13705	13705	I	970	"For just a moment I could n't stop myself from imagining him with a woman , what kind of participation he required , and I was disgruntled to feel scalding color rushing over my face . It only got worse when he gave me a coolly interested glance , as if I were an inept criminal he had just collared . That made me increasingly determined to stand my ground . "
13796	13798	13785	13785	you	606	Tara?""Probably . ""Then
13834	13884	13892	13892	I	970	"Travis was silent , still staring at me . I realized that no detail escaped his notice — the dark circles under my eyes , the scurf of dried baby spit - up on my shoulder , the unthinking way I had curved my hand over Luke 's head . "Ella
13886	13891	13892	13892	I	970	" he said quietly , "

13911	13980	13908	13908	I	970	" If it turns out that you 're not the father , then I 'm going to have the other lucky candidates served and made to take paternity tests . But I 'm giving you the chance to get it done right now , with no fuss and no publicity . Take the test , and if it goes your way , you 're out of the picture . "Travis
14004	14021	14023	14023	him	970	" I got lawyers who could make you run around in circles for months , honey . "I
14028	14056	14023	14023	him	970	" Come on , Jack . Do n't deprive me of the pleasure of watching you donate a DNA sample . I 'll even pay for it . ""That

14078	14111	14023	14023	him	970	""I'm sorry . I wish I could take your word about not having slept with Tara . But if you did , you do n't have much incentive to admit it , do you?"He

14248	14251	14252	14252	he	580	" There , "

14430	14434	14435	14435	Travis	580	"It 's okay , "
14438	14443	14435	14435	Travis	580	" I got him . "His

14576	14581	14582	14582	Travis	580	"I have a nephew . "

14671	14684	14669	14669	sir	580	" Helen gave me a neutral smile and picked up her phone . "I'm
14689	14693	14669	14669	sir	580	" I interjected . "
14702	14710	14711	14711	Travis	580	or—""We'll take care of the details later , "
14737	14745	14746	14746	he	580	" Wait here like a good girl , "
14749	14756	14746	14746	he	580	" while Helen makes the arrangements . "Good
14826	14840	14841	14841	you	619	" My cell number . I 'll be in touch later this evening . ""So
14849	14869	14841	14841	you	619	" I asked . Travis slanted a look at me , his eyes filled with a simmer of challenge . "I
14878	14983	14873	14873	I	970	" he said , and left the office with long , easy strides . FOURTHE HOTEL ROOM HELEN HAD RESERVED FOR ME WAS a luxurious suite with a separate sitting area and a kitchenette outfitted with a sink and a microwave . One look at the hotel — a European - style resort located in the Galleria area — and I knew my credit - card balance was going to be maxed out in a matter of hours . Maybe minutes . But the suite was gorgeous , the floors thickly carpeted , the bathroom lined with marble tiles and stocked with spa products . "Time
14987	14992	14873	14873	I	970	" I told Luke . "
14999	15430	14873	14873	I	970	" I opened the cans of formula I had brought up from the car , made several bottles , and stocked them in the tiny fridge . After lining the sink with a white towel , I filled it with warm water and gave Luke a bath . When he was clean and fed and drowsy , I laid him in the center of the king - sized bed . As I pulled the curtains over the windows , the afternoon blaze was extinguished by a shroud of slick , heavy brocade . Relishing the cool and quiet of the hotel room , I headed toward the bathroom to take a shower . But I paused as I glanced at the baby again . Luke was so alone and small , blinking up at the ceiling with quiet forbearance . I could n't bring myself to leave him while he was still awake . Not while he was waiting so patiently for whatever would happen to him next . I crawled onto the bed and lay next to him , stroking the dark fluff on his head . Living with Dane , I had heard and discussed and pondered any number of injustices in the world . But it hardly seemed that there could be anything worse than an unwanted child . Lowering my head , I pressed my cheek against his pale baby skin , and kissed the fragile curve of his skull . I watched his lashes lower , and his mouth compress like a grumpy old man 's . His hands rested on his chest like tiny pink starfish . I touched one of them with my finger , and his hand closed around it with surprising tightness . He fell asleep holding my finger . It was an intimacy unlike anything I had ever felt before . And an unfamiliar , sweet pain spread in my chest , as if my heart were cracking open . I dozed for a little while . After that I took a long shower and dressed in an oversized gray T - shirt and a pair of denim cutoffs . Returning to the bed , I opened my laptop and checked my e - mail . There was one from Liza : dear ella , this is a list of guys i know for sure tara went out with , i 'll send you more names when i remember them , i feel awful doing this behind tara 's back , she has a right to privacy you know . . ."Like
15433	15499	14873	14873	I	970	" I murmured aloud , reflecting that my sister had given up her right to privacy as soon as she 'd left her baby at my mother 's house .. . . i think i know where tara might be , but i 'm waiting for someone to call me back before i know for sure , i 'll let you know some time tomorrow . "Liza
15501	15506	15509	15509	anyone	2046	" I said ruefully , "
15523	15642	14873	14873	I	970	letter?"I opened the attachment containing the list of names and shook my head with a groan , wondering how the file had made it past the size restrictions of the e - mail provider . I closed and saved it . Before I got to my other e - mails , I clicked on Google and looked up Jack Travis , curious about what it would bring up . There was a long list of results , cluttered with references to the father , Churchill Travis , and the oldest brother , Gage . But there were a few interesting links to Jack , one of them to an article in a national business magazine . It was titled "
15648	15964	15965	15967	a busy boy	622	"Until Recent years , Jack Travis , middle son of billionaire Churchill Travis , has had a higher profile on Houston 's club scene and nightlife than in the business community . All that is about to change as Jack Travis comes into his own with a slew of projects and public - private ventures that promise to launch him into the top ranks of Texas developers . Although he is in a different trade from his father , Jack Travis has proved the rule that the apple never falls far from the tree . Yet when asked about his ambitions , Travis presents himself as an accidental businessman . The facts tend to belie his laid - back demeanor and what some label as false modesty . Exhibit A : Travis Capital , a recently formed subsidiary of Travis Manage ment Solutions , just acquired Alligator Creek , a 300 - acre golf course in South Florida for an undisclosed amount after months of negotiations . The coursewill be managed by a Miami partner company . Exhibit B : TMS is currently developing a section of downtown Houston , the equivalent of ten Manhattan blocks , into office buildings , apartment buildings , a retail concourse , and a cinema complex , all of which will be managed by a newly formed TMS division .... The article went on to describe other projects in the works . Going back to the results list , I saw a row of thumbnail pictures and clicked on a few of them . My eyes widened as I beheld a photo of a shirtless Jack waterskiing , his body lean and powerful , his stomach a virtual abacus of muscle . Another of Jack and a popular sitcom actress lounging on a Hawaiian beach . Jack and a female news anchor , dancing at a local charity event . "You're
15971	16014	15965	15967	a busy boy	622	" I murmured . Before I could open any more pictures , I was interrupted by the ring of my cell phone . Scrambling for my purse , I fished out the phone , hoping the noise would n't wake the baby . "Hello?""How
16019	16030	16031	16031	I	970	" Dane asked . I relaxed at the familiar voice . "
16041	16046	16047	16047	He	623	" I told him . "
16075	16078	16066	16066	we	624	"Dane chuckled . "
16083	16131	16080	16080	you	625	mom's?""Ha . She kicked me out first thing this morning . But Luke and I are staying at a chichi hotel . Mr. Travis had his secretary find it for us . I think the per - night cost would just about cover my monthly car payment . "
16178	16187	16188	16188	I	970	"So Travis agreed to take a paternity test , "
16195	16224	16226	16226	Travis	580	" And Liza 's still trying to track down Tara . And my column is late , so I 'm going to have to finish it up tonight . ""You
16237	16272	16232	16232	he	580	Tara?""Maybe not deliberately lying . But I think there 's a chance he 's mistaken . And obviously he thinks so , too , otherwise he would n't have agreed to the paternity test . ""Well
16291	16300	16301	16301	I	970	it?""She would probably look at it that way . "
16310	16344	16301	16301	I	970	" I hope she wo n't try to use Luke to get money out of the Travises whenever she wants it . He deserves more than to be treated like an ATM card . "
16396	16399	16400	16400	I	970	" Dane , "
16404	16434	16400	16400	I	970	" remember that thing you told me about the duck and the tennis ball ? About how baby ducks get attached to the first thing they see after they 're born?""Imprinting
16436	16444	16400	16400	I	970	""How does that work again ? . . .""After
16496	16502	16484	16484	I	970	""How long is the window of time?"Dane
16514	16524	16484	16484	I	970	" Why ? Are you afraid you 're the tennis ball?""I
16538	16544	16552	16552	Ella	0	"I heard him swear softly . "
16554	16558	16559	16559	I	970	""I wo n't , "
16563	16582	16559	16559	I	970	" I 'm coming back to Austin as soon as possible . I 'm certainly not going to — "
16593	16599	16583	16583	I	970	" Wait just a second , "
16686	16692	16693	16693	I	970	" It 's room service , "
16698	16705	16707	16707	babe	105	" Let me call you later . ""Sure
16709	16728	16707	16707	babe	105	"Closing the phone , I took an awkward step back and gestured for Jack to enter the suite . "
16731	16735	16707	16707	babe	105	" I said . "
16754	16792	16745	16745	I	970	""I'll make it quick . I just dropped off my clients . They 're staying here , too . Both of 'em are jet - lagged and ready to call it a day . Your room okay ? "
16793	16798	16707	16707	babe	105	" Yes . Thanks . "We
16843	16855	16856	16856	Jack	580	"My doctor will see us tomorrow morning for the paternity test , "
16859	16871	16856	16856	Jack	580	" I 'll pick you up in the lobby at nine . ""Do

16921	16930	16931	16931	you	629	" I think I 'll hear something soon . ""If
16948	16952	16955	16955	him	630	""A private detective ? "
16958	16980	16953	16953	I	970	" I do n't know if he could do anything — there 's not much to go on at this point . ""If
17000	17006	16981	16982	your sister	526	""What if the phone is turned off?""If
17047	17091	17097	17097	her	526	."Something about his cool , rational tone made me uneasy . He had the mind - set of a hunter , I thought . Thinking of Tara , worrying , I rubbed my sore temples and closed my eyes for a few seconds . "
17101	17105	17097	17097	her	526	" I said , "
17114	17119	17106	17106	I	970	""Have you eaten yet ? "
17125	17135	17122	17122	Jack	580	"Other than snack food from the minibar , no . ""Do

17160	17180	17153	17153	I	970	" You must be having a slow night . Do n't you have a harem to get back to or something?"Jack
17231	17257	17224	17224	Jack	580	" Have I done something to you , Ella ? Other than help you get a hotel room , and agree to take an unwarranted paternity test?""I'm

17329	17403	17326	17326	I	970	" I 'm hungry and sleep - deprived . I 've had no time to prepare for any of this . I ca n't find my sister , my mother is crazy , and my boyfriend is in Austin . So I 'm afraid you 're dealing with all my accumulated frustration . And I think on a subconscious level , you represent all the guys who might have knocked up my sister . "Jack
17410	17428	17326	17326	I	970	" It 's a lot easier to knock up someone when you actually have sex with her . ""We've

17476	17544	17326	17326	I	970	" Well , I appreciate the dinner offer . But as you can see , I 'm not dressed to go out . And not only am I tired of lugging around this eighty - five - pound baby but there 's no place you could take me to because I 'm a vegan , and no one in Houston knows how to cook without animal products . "The
17679	17689	17669	17669	his	2045	"There 's no use in trying to quiet him . "
17701	17715	17669	17669	his	2045	" He just screams louder and louder until he gets what he wants . ""Always
17720	17758	17669	17669	his	2045	" Jack said . After a couple of minutes I took the bottle from the sink , tested it , and went to an upholstered chair . Jack brought Luke to me , settling him in my waiting "
17784	17789	17775	17775	Jack	580	" Why are you a vegan?"I
17807	17814	17775	17775	Jack	580	"I'd rather not go into that . ""Not

17883	17933	17866	17866	You	637	" I looked down at Luke , brushing my fingetip over the tops of the miniature hands that had clamped on the sides of the bottle . My stomach growled again , even more loudly than the first time . I flushed in embarrassment . Jack 's brows lifted . "
17945	17953	17954	17954	I	970	""I'm starving . I 'm always hungry . "
17957	17990	17954	17954	I	970	" The reason I eat vegan is because my boyfriend Dane does . I never feel full for more than twenty minutes , and it 's hard to keep up my energy . ""Then

20315	20433	20436	20436	you	672	"Jack drank some wine and leaned back , watching me speculatively . He continued to hold the glass , his long fingers curved lightly around the crystal bowl . It was not at all what I would have expected a rich man 's hand to look like , brown and roughed - up , nails clipped close to the quick . Not a graceful hand , and yet attractive in its calloused power . . . holding the fragile glass so gently . . . . I could n't help staring . And for one second I imagined the touch of those blunt - tipped fingers on my skin , and I was instantly , disgracefully aroused . "

21818	21877	21878	21878	Dane	105	" Jack did n't move . We were standing close , and I was disconcerted to feel my breath quicken . Although his posture was relaxed and easy , he was so much bigger than me that I had a subtle sense of being physically dominated . What surprised me was that the feeling was n't entirely unpleasant . "Is
21883	21887	21889	21889	Beta	137	" he asked . "No
21900	21906	21894	21894	I	970	""Why ? Do they make you nervous?""Not
21910	21920	21921	21921	I	970	" I gave him a mock - threatening glance . "
21928	21939	21940	21940	I	970	"There was a spark of mischief in his dark eyes . "
21949	22007	21940	21940	I	970	" And he left before I could manage a reply . SIXI WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT POSSIBLE , BUT MY second night with Luke was even worse than the first . The glow of contentment I 'd gotten from an amazing steak dinner , fine wine , and lively conversation was completely gone by the second feeding . "
22018	22254	22016	22016	Luke	2045	" I told the baby , who did n't seem concerned in the least . I lost count of how many times he woke and how many diapers I changed , but it seemed like I did n't get more than twenty minutes of continuous sleep . When the wake - up call came at seven - thirty , I crawled painfully out of bed and staggered to the bathroom to brush my teeth and to take a shower . A fifteen - minute shower and two cups of stale - tasting coffee from the miniature countertop coffeemaker revived me somewhat . I dressed in khakis and a light blue shirt with elbow - length sleeves , and flat braided - hemp sandals . I debated whether or not to blow - dry my hair , afraid the noise would wake the baby , and then I decided grimly that he would damn well have to cry . After drying my hair into a smooth bob , I switched off the appliance . Silence . Had something happened to Luke ? Why was he so quiet ? I rushed into the bedroom and checked on him . He was lying peacefully on his back , his chest rising and falling , cheeks watercolor - pink . I touched him just to make sure he was okay . He yawned and closed his eyes more tightly . "Now
22260	22368	22016	22016	Luke	2045	" I muttered . I sat beside him , staring at the remarkably fine skin , the delicate lashes , the tiny drowsing features . His eyebrows were so sparse and silky , they were almost invisible . He looked like Tara . I could make out the resemblance in the shape of the nose and mouth — although the hair was inky - dark . Like Jack Travis 's , I thought , fingering the soft strands . Leaving the bed , I went to detach my cell phone from its plug - in charger . I dialed my cousin Liza . She picked up immediately . "
22369	22373	22409	22409	she	705	Hello?""It 's Ella . ""How

22395	22404	22393	22393	her	705	" Liza said triumphantly . My eyes widened . "

22654	22668	22583	22583	she	2035	" I do n't know . You 'll have to ask her yourself . "My
22679	22696	22673	22673	I	970	" Liza . . . she . . . did n't try to hurt herself , did she?""Oh
22725	22745	22720	22720	she	2045	"That drew a mirthless smile from me as I reflected that Tara needed a lot more than a vacation . "Anyway
22747	22752	22720	22720	she	2045	" my cousin said , "
22772	22870	22762	22762	I	970	"I took down the information , ended the call , and headed straight for my laptop . A Google search of the clinic revealed that it was a short - term residential treatment center located in a small town near Santa Fe . The pictures on the Web site made it look more like a spa or a vacation resort than a mental health clinic . In fact , a few holistic therapies and nutritional classes were mentioned . But the place also appeared to have a certified and licensed professional staff and intensive psychiatric services . The "
22872	23189	22720	22720	she	2045	" page described an emphasis on mind and body wellness , with the goal of using minimal or no medication . Mountain Valley Wellness looked kind of light - weight for a person who might have had a breakdown . Did they have the resources to help her ? Did they dispense psychological advice along with facials and pedicures?Although I badly wanted to call the admissions office , I knew there was no way they would violate the confidentiality of one of their patients . Sitting at the desk in the corner of the room , I clasped my head in my hands . I wondered how messed up my sister was . Fear , pity , anguish , anger , all tangled inside me as I reflected that it would be nearly impossible for most people to function well , having been brought up the way we had . I thought of my mother 's histrionic fits , the bizarre twists of logic , the wild impulses that had confused and frightened us . All those men coming and going , all part of Mom 's desperate search to make herself happy . But no one and nothing ever had . Our lives had not been normal , and our efforts to pretend otherwise had imposed a bitter isolation on Tara and me . We had grown up knowing we were different from everyone else . Neither of us seemed able to be close to anyone . Not even each other . Closeness meant the one you loved the most would cause you the most damage . How did you unlearn that ? It was woven deep between every fiber and vessel . You could n't cut it out . Slowly I picked up the phone and dialed Tara 's cell number . This time , unlike all my previous efforts , she picked up . "
23190	23196	22762	22762	I	970	Hello?""Tara , it 's me . ""Ella
23198	23200	23202	23202	I	970	""Are you okay?""Yeah
23206	23324	23202	23202	I	970	" My sister 's voice was high and wavering . The voice of a young child . The sound brought back a thousand memories . I remembered the child she had been . I remembered reading to her those days and nights when we had been left alone for far too long , when there was n't enough to eat and we had no idea where our mom was . I had read books about magical creatures , intrepid children , adventurous rabbits . And Tara had listened and listened , gathered tightly against my side , and I had n't complained even though we were both hot and sweaty because there was no air - conditioning . "Hey
23326	23331	23202	23202	I	970	" I said softly . "
23337	23344	23202	23202	I	970	you?""Oh . . . not much . "We

23386	23449	23376	23376	I	970	" You 're the only person I know who hates surprises as much as I do . Is a little advance warning too much to ask ? You could have called me . E - mailed . Sent me a ' what I did over summer vacation ' essay . Instead , I get a call from Mom the night before last . "A
23454	23459	23376	23376	I	970	" Is she mad at me?""She
23464	23469	23376	23376	I	970	" I said reasonably . "

23643	23785	23631	23631	They	721	"I was struck silent . Why three months ? How did they know that was the necessary amount of time to deal with Tara 's problems ? Had they taken stock and concluded she was only three months ' worth of crazy ? Surely if she were suicidal or psychotic , they 'd want to keep her longer . Or was it possible they did n't want to reveal the truth to Tara , that she had been enrolled in their extended residency program ? There were about a dozen questions I wanted to ask at once , all of them so urgent that they bottlenecked and I could n't get out a sound . I cleared my throat , trying to relieve it of clotted words that tasted like salt . As if she sensed my helplessness , Tara said , "

24066	24077	24062	24062	I	970	" A long silence , and then Tara asked tentatively , "

Stuff like that . But the rest of it is a big blank . And when I try to remember things , I start to feel scared and dizzy . "My

24603	24852	24853	24853	Tara	364	"I went to the door , opened it , and gestured for Jack Travis to come in with a sharp motion of my hand . I was in a flurry , feeling as if I were about to fly apart . Jack entered the room . Something about his presence quieted the hard - thumping clamor in my ears . His eyes were black and fathomless . He gave me an alert glance , taking full measure of the situation . With a short nod that conveyed Everything 's cool , he went to the bed and looked down at the sleeping baby . He was dressed in slightly baggy jeans and a green polo shirt with slits on the sides , the kind of outfit a man could only wear if he had a perfect physique and did n't give a damn about appearing taller , more muscular , leaner , because he already was all those things . My senses stung with primal warning as I saw the powerfully built male standing over the baby , who was too helpless even to roll over on his own . For a split second I was amazed by my own protective instincts over a child who was n't even mine . I was a tigress , ready to pounce . But I relaxed as I saw Jack rearrange the baby blanket over Luke 's tiny chest . I sat on an ottoman , positioned by an overstuffed chair . "
24855	24860	24853	24853	Tara	364	" I said carefully , "

25489	25538	25482	25482	you	742	" Tara finally said . My forehead felt like it had been tacked against my skull . I rubbed it , moving the tight skin , pressing hard into the little shallow where the top of my nose fused into orbital bone . I was trapped . Cornered . "

26706	26737	26646	26646	I	970	"That meant no , I thought . My nose and lips were numb . I looked past Jack 's shoulder to the bed , wondering if the baby was cold . "He
26741	26754	26762	26762	Ella	0	" Jack said gently , as if he could read my thoughts . "
26764	26990	26762	26762	Ella	0	"I jumped a little as I felt his hand close over one of mine . I gave him a round - eyed glance , wondering what he wanted . But there was nothing suggestive in his touch or his gaze . His hand was startling in its strength and heat . Something about that vital grip animated me like a drug injected straight into my bloodstream . Such an intimate thing , the clasp of hands . The comfort and pleasure I derived from it were unspeakably disloyal to Dane . But before I could object or even fully absorb the sensation , the warm touch was withdrawn . All my life , I 'd had to grapple with the needs engendered by the lack of a father . It had left me with a deeply buried attraction to strong men , men with the capacity to dominate , and that terrified me . So I had always gone in the other direction , toward men like Dane who made you kill your own spiders and carry your own suitcase . That was exactly what I wanted . And yet someone like Jack Travis , unimpeachably male , so damned sure of himself , held a secret , nearly fetishistic allure to me . I had to lick my dry lips before I could speak . "
26998	27009	26991	26991	You	760	"Jack shook his head , his gaze locked on mine . "I'm

27045	27073	27043	27043	you	760	" he murmured . I blinked . I could still feel the part of my hand he had gripped . My fingers flexed to retain the sensation . "
27076	27085	27086	27086	you	760	" I said , oddly out of breath , "
27113	27154	27105	27105	I	970	"I stood , and so did Jack , and his body was so close I could almost feel the solid warmth of him . Too close . I would have stepped back , except the ottoman was right behind me . "You're
27169	27179	27105	27105	I	970	" he said rather than asked . I nodded . "How

27192	27210	27186	27186	I	970	" I 'm going to be optimistic and assume it wo n't be any more than that . "
27219	27228	27229	27229	I	970	" My shoulders hitched in a helpless shrug . "
27248	27382	27383	27383	me	970	"It was n't going to work . I knew Dane well enough to be certain that there was serious trouble ahead for us . It occurred to me that I might lose him over this . The day before yesterday , my life had been great . Now it was falling apart . How was I going to make room in my life for a baby ? How was I going to get my work done ? How was I going to hold on to Dane?A little cry floated from the bed . Somehow that sound brought everything into focus . Dane did n't matter at the moment . Logistics , money , careers , none of it mattered . Right now the only important thing was the hunger of a helpless infant . "Call
27391	27409	27410	27410	I	970	" Jack said . Heading to the minibar , I rummaged for a bottle of chilled formula . "

27480	27484	27467	27467	He	764	"You're not involved , "
27506	27513	27498	27498	Jack	580	" Call me when you decide . ""Sure
27515	27550	27552	27552	Ella	0	" I had no intention of ever seeing him again , and we both knew it . His lips twitched . I stiffened . I did n't like it when someone found me amusing . "Later
27554	27565	27552	27552	Ella	0	"And he was gone . Luke squawked from the bed . "I'm
27568	27812	27816	27816	Luke	2045	" I told him , and hurried to get his bottle ready . SEVENI FED LUKE AND CHANGED HIS DIAPER CALLING Dane would have to wait until Luke was ready to rest again . I realized I was already starting to arrange my life according to Luke 's patterns . His eating and sleeping and periods of wakefulness formed the structure around which everything else had to be interpolated . Settling him on his back , I hung over him , crooning bits and pieces from nursery songs , dredging them up from childhood memory . Luke bobbed and arched , following me with his mouth , his eyes . I took one of his waving hands and pressed it to my cheek . His palms were the size of quarters . He kept his hand on me , staring in absorption at my face , seeking the connection as much as I did . I had never been so wanted or needed by anyone on earth . Babies were dangerous . . . they made you fall in love before you knew what was happening . This small , solemn creature could n't even say my name , and he depended on me for everything . Everything . I 'd known him for little more than a day . But I would have thrown myself in front of a bus for him . I was shattered by him . This was awful . "I
27818	27914	27816	27816	Luke	2045	" I whispered . He looked completely unsurprised by the revelation . Of course you love me , his expression seemed to say . I 'm a baby . This is what I do . His hand flexed a little on my cheek , testing its pliancy . His fingernails were scratchy . How did you trim a baby 's nails ? Could you do it with regular adult clippers , or did you need some special tool ? I lifted his feet and kissing the little pink soles , innocently smooth as kitten paws . "
27921	27926	27816	27816	Luke	2045	" I asked him . "
27934	28238	28310	28310	her	766	number?"I realized I had not given my married friend Stacy nearly enough respect or understanding when she 'd had her baby . I had tried to work up some sympathetic interest , but I 'd had no idea what she 'd been faced with . You could n't until you faced it yourself . Had she felt this overwhelmed , this ill equipped for the respons - ibility of growing a person ? I 'd always heard that women possessed an instinct for this , some hidden cache of maternal wisdom that unlocked when you needed it . No such feeling was coming to me . The only thing I could identify was a powerful urge to call my best friend Stacy and whine . And having always believed in the therapeutic value of the occasional good , thorough whine , I called her . I was in new territory , the perils and pitfalls of which were entirely familiar to Stacy . She had dated Dane 's best friend Tom for years , which was how I 'd gotten to know her . And then she 'd accidentally gotten pregnant by Tom , and he 'd done the expected thing and married her . The baby , a girl named Tommie , was now three . Stacy and Tom both swore it was the best thing that had ever happened to them . Tom even seemed to mean it . Dane and Tom were still best friends , but I knew that privately Dane thought of Tom as a sell - out . Once , Tom had been a liberal activist and rugged individualist , and now he was married and owned a minivan with stained seat - belt straps and a floor littered with empty juice boxes and Happy Meal toys . "Stace
28240	28253	28310	28310	her	766	" I said urgently , relieved when she picked up the phone . "

28313	28315	28316	28316	I	970	"Doomed , "

28401	28405	28406	28406	Stacy	149	""That 's tough , "
28409	28439	28406	28406	Stacy	149	"It gets worse . The older sister lives in Austin with a boyfriend who 's already told her she ca n't bring the baby back to live with them . ""Asshole

28449	28500	28501	28501	Stacy	149	reason?""I think he does n't want the responsibility . I think he 's afraid it will interfere with his plans to save the world . And maybe he 's afraid this might change their relationship and the girlfriend will start wanting more from him than she has in the past . "Finally
28505	28520	28501	28501	Stacy	149	" Oh . My . Lord . Ella , are you talking about you and Dane?"It
28570	28577	28578	28578	I	970	"I'm in Houston with the baby , "
28582	28637	28578	28578	I	970	" We 're in a hotel room . He 's right next to me . I do n't want to do this . But he 's the first guy I 've said ' I love you ' to since high school . Oh , Stace , you would n't believe how cute he is . ""All
28642	28647	28651	28652	this one	779	" Stacy said darkly . "I
28657	28663	28651	28652	this one	779	""All babies are above average . "I
28678	28690	28670	28671	the baby	2045	" Luke is in the top one percent of above average . ""Hold
28706	28786	28787	28787	you	782	Tooooooom!"I waited while Stacy explained the situation to her husband . Of Dane 's considerable number of friends , Tom had always been my favorite . There was never any boredom or melancholy when Tom was around . . . wine flowed , people laughed , conversation coursed easily . When Tom was around , you felt witty and smart . Stacy was the taut and dependable clothesline from which the colorful Tom was free to wave and beckon . "Can
28795	28800	28789	28789	Tom	150	" I asked Stacy . "At
28829	28834	28823	28823	you	782	" My stomach lurched . "
28857	28876	28877	28877	He	105	" A stinging haze came over my eyes . My voice came out thin and emotion - cluttered . "
28899	28910	28886	28886	He	105	""Bullshit . You come right back here with that baby . "
28911	28920	28969	28969	Dane	105	" I ca n't . You know Dane . ""I
28956	28968	28969	28969	Dane	105	"For some reason I felt compelled to take Dane 's side . "
28976	28987	28988	28988	He	105	" I said , blotting my eyes on my sleeve . "
29046	29067	29068	29068	She	787	""Of course it does . He 's your partner . And having a baby is not suffering . It 's — "
29077	29113	29068	29068	She	787	" Shut up , Tom . Ella , when a baby comes into your life , you have to give a lot . But you get even more than you give . You 'll see . "Luke
29145	29154	29155	29155	Stacy	149	" . . . had a terrific childhood , "
29159	29220	29155	29155	Stacy	149	" and he 's at the right age to settle down . Everyone who knows him thinks he 'd make a wonderful father . You need to force the issue , Ella .

29228	29232	29233	29233	He	105	" I said . "

29254	29283	29284	29284	She	149	" The whole point of a relationship is to have someone there when you need him . Otherwise it 's just a . . . wait a minute . "
29297	29315	29284	29284	She	149	" Do you want Tom to talk to him ? He says he 'd be glad to . ""No

29343	29396	29397	29397	She	149	" You 're being pressured , are n't you ? You 're having to face a tough situation — why should n't he have to help you with it ? I swear , Ella , if Dane does n't do right by you , I 'm going to give him such shit — "

29696	29757	29643	29643	Ella	0	" It 's all a trap to him , anything that smacks of the house , the dog , the wife , and the two - point - five kids . And unlike Stacy and apparently everyone else we know , I do n't think Dane would make a wonderful father . He 's not nearly enough of a masochist . "I
29776	29803	29805	29806	tough customers	792	" I know that Dane would rather try to save the world than try to save one baby . But I ca n't figure out why . ""Babies

31418	31488	31413	31413	LUKE	2045	" is find a nice place we can rent or sublet . Should we focus on the downtown area ? Montrose ? Or would you be open to finding something close by in Sugar Land ? We could always go to Austin , but we 'd have to take care to avoid you - know - who . And it 's a lot more expensive to rent in Austin . "Luke
31505	31511	31514	31514	him	2045	"Are you thinking it over ? "

31593	31650	31589	31589	I	970	" that you 're supposed to be sleeping fifteen to eighteen hours a day . You need to work on that . It also says I 'm supposed to sanitize all the stuff you put your mouth on . And it says you 're going to learn how to smile by the end of the month . "I
31782	31789	31790	31790	I	970	"We've got to find something today , "
31794	31804	31790	31790	I	970	" And get out of this expensive hotel room . "

31867	31880	31849	31849	I	970	" I heard Jack 's distinctive baritone , fluid as molten pennies . "

32063	32078	32060	32060	I	970	" At the moment Luke and I do n't have anything nice to wear . ""No
32090	32141	32088	32088	him	832	"To my surprise , Jack picked us up in a small hybrid SUV . I had expected a gas - guzzling monster , or maybe a hideously expensive sports car . I certainly had n't bargained on something that Dane or one of his friends would have felt comfortable driving . "You
32147	32168	32169	32169	I	970	" I said in wonder , struggling to strap the base of Luke 's car seat in the back row . "
32182	32185	32186	32186	Jack	580	""A Hummer , "
32216	32234	32204	32204	He	2045	" Houston 's got enough toxic emissions . I 'm not going to add to the problem . "I
32239	32249	32251	32252	an environmentalist	835	" That sounds like something an environmentalist would say . ""I
32254	32259	32251	32252	an environmentalist	835	" Jack said mildly . "You

32362	32557	32560	32560	Dane	105	"Jack took Luke 's carrier from me and carefully locked it onto the base . He paused to murmur to the baby , who was strapped in like a mini - astronaut ready for a dangerous mission . Standing back and a little to the side , I could n't help appreciating the view as Jack bent into the car 's interior . He was a powerfully built man , tight - loomed muscles encased in boot - cut denim jeans , his big shoulders flexing beneath a light blue shirt with rolled - up sleeves . He had the kind of form ideal for a quarterback , heavy enough to take a hit from a rusher , tall enough to throw an accurate pass over linemen , lean enough to be limber and fast . As was often the case in Houston , a drive that should have taken fifteen minutes lasted almost a half hour . But I enjoyed the ride . Not only was I happy to be out of the hotel room , but Luke was sleeping , lulled by the air - conditioning and the motion of the car . "What
32562	32567	32560	32560	Dane	105	" Jack asked casually . "
32571	32582	32583	32583	I	970	up?"No , not at all . We 're still together . "
32591	32619	32583	32583	I	970	" But we 're on . . . hiatus . Just for three months , until Tara comes for her baby and I go back to Austin . ""Does

32685	32694	32682	32682	you	105	" Jack said . I raised my brows . "Maybe

32718	32729	32682	32682	you	105	"He was so outrageous , I could n't help laughing . "
32745	32747	32748	32748	he	580	engaged?""Once , "
32751	32759	32748	32748	he	580	" But it did n't work out . ""Why
32760	32779	32780	32780	She	840	not?""Why?"The hesitation before his reply was long enough that I realized this was a subject he seldom discussed . "

32902	32926	32831	32831	women	311	" Jack asked . I understood immediately . I tried to keep my sympathy concealed , sensing that he would n't like it . "

32955	33032	32952	32952	I	970	" It 's the worst when they get married , because then everyone thinks it absolves the couple of all wrongdoing . ' Oh , well , they cheated on you , but they got married so that makes everything all right .

33188	33196	33197	33197	I	970	"So am I right about their marriage ? "

34144	34220	34221	34221	I	970	" I protested , while humiliation sent a wash of scarlet from head to toe . The truth was , I had been implying it . As if I , Ella Varner , were so irresistible that Jack Travis would go to extraordinary lengths to have me live in the same building . Good Lord , from what part of my ego had that emerged from ? I struggled to come up with a save . "
34242	34266	34267	34267	Jack	580	""I'd make an exception for Luke . After the start he 's gotten in life , he 's due for a good turn . "

34400	34408	34409	34409	She	164	" Oh , what a cute baby . "

34517	34596	34506	34506	I	970	"Haven welcomed us into her apartment , a small one - bedroom unit decorated in shades of white and cream and distressed dark woods . The disciplined color scheme was enlivened by a few jolts of fresh botanical green . A Swedish wooden floor clock occupied the corner . The main living space was filled with a few simple pieces of furniture — antique French chairs , an overstuffed sofa covered in black - and - cream toile . "My

I could tell the moment he found my page , with its cartoon portrait of me wearing cartoon high heels and a fashionable swing coat . And I knew exactly what he was reading even before his brows began to inch toward his hairline . Dear Miss Independent , I'm dating a fantastic guy — handsome , successful , caring , and good in bed . But there 's a problem . He 's built on the petite side , sexually speaking . I 've always heard that size does n't matter , but I ca n't help wishing he had more to offer in that department . I want to stay with him in spite of the fact that he 's hung like a cocktail weenie , but how can I stop wishing for a kielbasa ? "

And to my horror , as Jack approached the bed I had a terrible instinctive urge to lift my arms to him . But he was not Dane , and it was inappropriate , very nearly appalling , to think of him in the same context . It had taken four years of hard - won confidences and emotional risk for Dane and me to reach the intimacy we now shared . I could n't imagine having that with any other man . Before I could move , Jack came to stand beside the bed , looking down at me with soft dark eyes . I fell back a little , my stomach clenching with pleasure as I imagined for a split - second that he was about to lower over me , and his weight would be so hard and satisfying—"Your

40462	41072	41077	41077	me	970	" * * * JACK FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN MANY OF HAVEN 'S childhood stories . In the manner of older brothers , he had alternately been the hero and the villain . Most often the villain . But now in adulthood , in a family with complex dynamics , a close bond had formed between them . According to Haven , their older brother Gage had always been the focus of their father 's greatest demands , highest praise , and deepest ambitions . The only child of Churchill Travis 's first marriage , Gage had worked hard to please his father , to become the perfect son . He had been serious , driven , hyper - responsible , distinguishing himself at an elite boarding school , later graduating from UT and Harvard Business School . But Gage was not nearly the hard - ass their father had been . He had an innate kindness , an allowance for human frailty , that Churchill Travis found difficult to summon . Churchill 's second marriage had lasted until the death of his wife , Ava , and had produced three children : Jack , Joe , and Haven . Since Gage already shouldered the main burden of expectation and responsibility , Jack had the opportunity to play , experiment , run wild , make friends . He had always been the first to jump into a fight and the first to shake hands afterward . He 'd played every sport , charmed his teachers into giving him better grades than he deserved , and dated the prettiest girls in school . He was a loyal friend who paid his debts and never broke his word . Nothing made Jack madder than when someone made a deal with him and would n't keep their side of it . When Churchill had decided his young sons needed to be reminded what hard labor was , he set them to laying sod in the blistering south Texas sun , or building a hand - cut stone fence along the edge of their property , until their muscles were on fire and a dark tan had saturated their skin several layers down . Of the three boys , only Jack had truly enjoyed the outside labor . Sweat , dirt , physical exertion — had all felt purifying to him . His basic need to test himself against the land , and nature , manifested in a lifelong love of outdoor pursuits : hunting , fishing , anything that took him away from the air - conditioned opulence of River Oaks . Haven had been spared these particular life lessons from her father . Instead , she had been subjected to her mother 's notions of how to bring up a girl to be ladylike . Naturally Haven had been a tomboy , forever trailing after her three brothers . Because of the significant age difference between Gage and Haven , he had assumed a vaguely paternal role , intervening on her behalf when he deemed it necessary . But Jack had warred with Haven on many occasions , such as when she had gone uninvited into his room or played with his train set without asking . For revenge , he had given her Indian burns , and when she had tattled on him , their daddy had beaten him with his belt until Haven had cried . Schooled in the Texan art of manliness , Jack had prided himself on not shedding one tear . Afterward , Churchill had told his wife Ava that Jack was the most stubborn boy alive . "
41079	41212	41213	41213	I	970	" the father had said , frustrated that he could not motivate the rebellious Jack the way he had with Gage . Haven told me she had been miserable when Gage , her champion , had been sent away to school . But contrary to all expectations , Jack had not persecuted her in their brother 's absence . When she came home crying one day because a boy at school was bullying her , Jack had listened to the whole story , and rode off on his bike to take care of the problem . The bully never bothered Haven again . Never came near her , as a matter of fact . They had lost touch for a while after Haven married a man her father had n't approved of . "
41225	41230	41213	41213	I	970	" she said ruefully . "

41331	41355	41306	41306	buddies	1000	" part , knowing something pretty major had happened . But that was a conversation that would take place in its own time . "What
41364	41371	41306	41306	buddies	1000	" I could n't resist asking . "
41376	41419	41373	41373	he	2268	down?""Absolutely . Jack likes women — I mean truly likes them , not in some misogynistic notch - on - the - bedpost way . But he 's not going to commit until he finds someone he 's sure he can trust . ""Because

41546	41630	41538	41540	the busiest people	1005	"I changed the subject at the first opportunity . Talking about Jack made me restless and vaguely irritable , the way I felt when I wanted something I knew was bad for me . I TALKED WITH DANE ON THE PHONE EVERY NIGHT telling him about my new surroundings and about Luke . Although Dane did n't want to have anything to do with a baby personally , he certainly did n't mind hearing about Luke and the experience of caring for him . "Do
41639	41655	41637	41637	one	691	" I asked Dane , relaxing on the sofa with Luke draped on my chest . "I
41706	41735	41738	41738	Ella	0	""Yes , but what about raising a child who will care about those things , too ? That 's a way to make the world a better place . ""Come
41773	41797	41798	41798	You	1010	"I chuckled , envisioning a toddler — Dane 's toddler — dressed in a miniature three - piece suit and carrying a calculator . "
41803	41811	41798	41798	You	1010	""Are you thinking about having one someday ? "
41812	41818	41819	41819	I	970	" No , God no , "
41824	41951	41819	41819	I	970	" I 'm trying to hang on until I can give Luke back to Tara . I 'm dying for a good night of sleep . Or an uninterrupted meal . And just once , I 'd like to go out without all this paraphernalia . It 's insane . The stroller , the diapers , wipes , burp cloths , binkies , bottles . . . I 've forgotten what it 's like to just pick up the keys and walk out the door . And there are all these pediatric visits I 've had to schedule — developmental assessments and screenings and shots — so it 's a good thing I 'm not sleeping , because I 'll need the extra time to work . ""Maybe
41973	41980	41981	41981	I	970	""I think it 's like rhubarb , "
41984	42013	41981	41981	I	970	" You either love it or you hate it . But you ca n't ever make yourself acquire a taste for it if you 're not naturally predisposed . ""I
42017	42145	42148	42148	Luke	2045	" Dane said . BY THE END OF MY FIRST FULL WEEK AT 1800 MAIN , I was still mastering the trick of carrying a bag of groceries and pushing a stroller while getting through doorways . It was early Friday evening . The traffic was so bad that instead of driving anywhere , I had decided to walk a quarter of a mile to an Express grocery and deli , and back . After the short walk in the heat , Luke and I were parboiled . The plastic handles of the grocery bags were slipping in my wet palm and the diaper bag threatened to slide off my shoulder as I maneuvered the stroller into the lobby . And the baby was making fretful noises . "You
42150	42155	42148	42148	Luke	2045	" I said breathlessly , "
42207	42221	42222	42222	Varner	2045	" Swearing and sweating , I pushed the stroller past the concierge desk . "Miss
42229	42238	42222	42222	Varner	2045	" the concierge asked , beginning to rise . "No
42249	42343	42245	42245	We	1013	" I lurched past the etched glass doors and reached an elevator just as it opened . Two people stepped out , a gorgeous redhead wearing a skimpy white dress and strappy gold sandals . . . and Jack Travis in a lean black suit , a crisp white shirt open at the throat , and sleek black oxfords . In one glance he took in my dilemma . Simultaneously , he reached for the grocery bags and used his foot to keep open the elevator door . His dark brown eyes sparkled . "
42349	42364	42347	42347	Ella	0	"My breath stuck in my throat . I found myself smiling at him idiotically . "
42369	42381	42367	42367	Jack	580	""You heading up ? Looks like you could use a hand . ""No
42390	42399	42388	42388	you	580	" I pushed the stroller onto the elevator . "We'll

42419	42423	42424	42424	You	580	" he said . "

42440	42518	42521	42521	he	1016	" The woman seemed friendly , and nice , giving me a wide - open smile as she stepped back into the elevator . I could n't fault Jack 's taste . Sonya was a stunner , with gleaming perfect skin , vivid red hair , and a magnificent figure . As she bent over to coo at the fussy baby , the combination of her abundant cleavage and beautiful face was enough to make Luke quiet . "
42528	42532	42521	42521	he	1016	" she exclaimed . "He
42542	42558	42521	42521	he	1016	""Look at all that dark hair . . . he must take after his daddy . ""I

42817	42821	42812	42815	a boyfriend in Austin	1021	" I volunteered . "
42832	42837	42822	42822	I	970	"Sonya 's frown cleared . "
42844	42875	42822	42822	I	970	"We reached my door , and I pushed the combination on the keypad . While Jack held open the door , I wheeled the stroller inside and lifted Luke out . "
42879	42903	42822	42822	I	970	" I said , watching Jack set the grocery bags on the coffee table . Sonya cast an admiring glance around the apartment . "
42907	42916	42917	42917	I	970	""I ca n't take any credit for that , "
42920	42930	42917	42917	I	970	" But Luke and I are making our contribution . "
42962	42968	42969	42969	Jack	580	"What are you putting together ? "
42972	43092	42969	42969	Jack	580	"A crib with a changing table attachment . I bought it at Rice Village the other day when I was out with Haven . Unfortunately , they charge a hundred bucks extra if you want it assembled , so I said I 'd rather do it myself . The delivery guys brought this box of parts with some instructions , and so far I 'm still trying to figure it out . I think it would be easier if I could read the manual . So far I 've found the Japanese , French , and German pages , but nothing in English . Now I sort of wish I 'd gone ahead and paid the extra hundred bucks . "
43103	43110	43098	43098	I	970	" But I like a challenge . ""Let
43116	43120	43114	43114	Jack	580	" Sonya urged . "Right
43122	43185	43114	43114	Jack	580	" But he did n't move , just looked from me and Luke to the pile of crib parts . The odd moment of expectant silence caused my heart to lurch with an extra thud . His gaze returned to mine , and he gave me a brief nod that held an implicit promise : Later . I did n't want that . "
43191	43196	43114	43114	Jack	580	" I said brightly . "
43200	43203	43114	43114	Jack	580	"Sonya smiled . "
43206	43314	43114	43114	Jack	580	" Taking Jack 's arm , she tugged him from the apartment . THREE HOURS LATER LUKE WATCHED FROM AN INFANT bouncy seat while I sat on the floor surrounded by crib parts . I was finished with dinner , which had consisted of spaghetti with tomato sauce , ground beef , and fresh basil . When the leftovers were cool , I was going to freeze them in individual - size portions . Having grown tired of Mozart and the sock puppets , I had hooked up my iPod to the speakers . The air was filled with the raw , sexy purr of Etta James . "
43324	43338	43114	43114	Jack	580	" I told Luke , pausing to sip from my glass of wine , "
43368	43376	43366	43366	musicians	1025	"I heard a knock at the door . "
43390	43458	43383	43383	you	1023	" Rising with my wineglass in hand , I padded barefoot to the apartment entrance . I was wearing a set of pajamas the color of pink cotton candy . I had taken out my contacts and put on my glasses . Standing on my toes , I looked through the peephole . My breath quickened as I saw the familiar outline of a man 's head . "I'm
43464	43471	43383	43383	you	1023	" I said through the door . "
43477	43516	43383	43383	you	1023	"I unlatched the door and opened it to reveal Jack Travis , now wearing jeans and a white shirt , holding a small canvas case that was frayed from heavy use . His gaze coursed slowly over me . "
43524	43525	43383	43383	you	1023	" "
43531	43543	43383	43383	you	1023	" I tried to ignore the heavy pounding of my heart . "

43578	43628	43576	43576	I	970	in?"I wanted to refuse him . I sensed there was something between us , something that required negotiation , compromise . . . but I was n't ready for it . I could n't think of a reason to keep him out . I took an uncertain step back . "

44101	44119	44094	44094	I	970	""Thanks . I laid out all the pieces according to the diagram , but without the directions in English—""No
44124	44145	44094	44094	I	970	" Jack glanced at the diagram briefly , tossed it aside , and began sorting through the painted wood pieces . "
44151	44166	44094	44094	I	970	""Straightforward ? Did you see how many different kinds of screws are in that plastic bag?""We'll

44700	44939	44656	44656	me	970	bread?"After dinner , Jack was back on the floor , putting together the crib with a deftness born of vast experience . He was good with his hands , confident and capable . I had to admit , I enjoyed watching as he rolled up his sleeves over hair - dusted forearms and knelt in front of the wooden frame , his body athletic and superbly conditioned . I sat nearby with a glass of wine and handed screws to him . Every now and then he got close enough that I caught the scent of him , a sexual incense of male sweat and clean skin . He swore a couple of times as a couple of screws were stripped , the fluent profanity immediately followed by a beg - pardon . Jack Travis was a novelty in my experience , an old - fashioned man 's man . None of the boys I had gone to college with had been anything more than that , just boys trying to figure out who they were and what their place in the world was . Dane and his friends were sensitive , environmentally aware guys who rode bikes and had Facebook accounts . I could n't imagine Jack Travis ever blogging or worrying about finding himself , and it was pretty certain that he did n't give a damn about whether or not his clothes were sustainably produced .

45306	45314	45315	45315	Jack	580	"Want it here or in the bedroom ? "
45318	45342	45315	45315	Jack	580	"The bedroom 's so small , I 'd rather keep it in here . Is that weird , having a crib in the main room?""Not
45354	45410	45348	45348	Luke	2045	"With Jack 's help , I moved the crib beside the sofa and put a sheet over the mattress . Gently , I lowered the drowsy baby into the crib and covered him with a blanket , and started a mobile playing overhead . Bears and honeypots circled slowly , accompanied by a gentle lullaby . "
45414	45418	45348	45348	Luke	2045	" Jack whispered . "Doesn't

The dark city was seething outside , scored with traffic , people swarming , drinking , dancing , while the ground slowly released the heat of the day . But we were tucked away in this cool , protected place , everything as it should be . I needed to fill Luke 's bottles , and get ready for the night . We had a routine . I found something deeply comforting in the rituals of bath and bedtime . "It
45537	45558	45525	45525	I	970	" I said , barely aware I was speaking aloud . My hand gripped the top of the crib rail . "
45566	45637	45638	45638	I	970	"For reply , Jack slid his hand over mine , engulfing it with warm pressure . Before I could look up at him , he let go and went to pack up his tools . Methodically , he dumped all the scraps of cardboard and plastic into the flat rectangular box the crib had come in . Lifting the box with one hand , he carried it to the door . "
45646	45649	45656	45656	him	326	""Thank you . "
45659	45668	45652	45652	I	970	" I appreciate this , Jack . Everything . I—"The

45826	45836	45821	45821	I	970	" I was n't making a pass at you . ""I
45839	45870	45803	45803	I	970	" One hand slid to the back of my head , fingers lacing through the silky - fine locks . Gripping gently , he guided me to look at him . "
45886	45888	45879	45879	I	970	""Jack , don't—""I
45892	45911	45916	45916	they	1060	" he murmured , touching the rectang - ular rim of my glasses , carefully grasping an earpiece . "
45922	45923	45916	45916	they	1060	" "
45927	45941	45945	45945	Ella	0	" I tensed as he pulled off my glasses and set them aside . "
45947	46270	46271	46271	I	970	" And his head lowered . ELEVENIF I'D BEEN THINKING RATIONALLY , I NEVER WOULD have allowed it . Jack 's mouth brushed slowly over mine before settling with gentle pressure . I moved against his unyielding weight until I found some perfect , unexpected alignment that sent heat jolting through me . My knees gave out , but it did n't matter because he was holding me so securely . One of his hands came up to my jaw with extreme care . Every time I tried to finish the kiss , he pressed harder , coaxing me to stay open , tasting slowly . This was so different from what I was accustomed to , it seemed like something other than kissing . I realized that my kisses with Dane had become a form of punctuation , the quotations or the hasty dash at the end of a conversation . This was softer , more urgent and relentless . Wild , fresh , tumbling kisses , eroding my balance . I groped Jack 's shoulders , my fingers curving over the hard nape of his neck . He took a quick breath and reached down , his hand sliding over my pajama bottoms as he coaxed my hips high and tight . The full - on pressure of him was stunning , galvanic . He was unbelievably hard . Everywhere . He was in control , infinitely stronger , and he wanted me to know it . He kissed me until the sensations flowed in directions I could n't go , spilling and sliding darkly . As I felt a desperate ache cambering low in my body , I finally understood that if I slept with this man , he would take everything . All the defenses I had built would be destroyed . Shaking , I pushed at him and managed to turn my head long enough to gasp , "
46283	46317	46281	46281	Jack	580	"He stopped at once . But he kept me against him , his chest moving hard and fast . I could n't look at him . My voice was hoarse as I said , "
46324	46335	46341	46341	he	580	""I've wanted this since the first second I saw you . "
46358	46364	46355	46355	he	580	" You did , too . ""I
46371	46378	46368	46368	I	970	""You need some fun , Ella . "I
46385	46398	46399	46399	I	970	" Believe me , I do n't need fun , I need — "
46462	46476	46455	46455	Jack	580	" You should take me on . I 'd be good for you . ""You
46531	46578	46522	46523	the NRA	1063	" I could n't seem to shut up . I was talking too much , breathing too fast , jittering like a wind - up toy that had been wound to the limits of its mechanism . Jack nuzzled into a sensitive place behind my ear . "
46582	46621	46622	46622	I	970	matter?""Is that a yes ? It must be . God . It matters because — stop that . It matters because I would only go to bed with a man who respected me and my views . My — "

46645	46696	46642	46642	he	1062	" And your views . I think of you as an equal . I respect your brains , and all those big words you like to use . But I also want to rip your clothes off and have sex with you until you scream and cry and see God . "
46726	46761	46715	46715	his	1062	" I 'm gon na show you a good time , Ella . Starting with some take - no - prisoners sex . The kind when you ca n't remember your own name after . ""I've

46822	46830	46831	46831	I	970	" When you offered me the apartment , "
46835	46857	46831	46831	I	970	" you implied you had no ulterior motives . I do n't appreciate the position this puts me in , Jack . "His

46942	46949	46950	46950	I	970	" I 'm kicking you out . "
46970	46980	46964	46964	His	105	" There 's more we need to talk about . "
46981	47002	46964	46964	His	105	" I know . But if I let you stay , I do n't think we 'll do much talking . "
47003	47012	46964	46964	His	105	" What if I promise I wo n't touch you?"As
47028	47034	47035	47035	I	970	" You 'd be lying , "
47048	47053	47038	47038	Jack	580	" You 're right . "I
47061	47065	47038	47038	Jack	580	" Please go . "He
47070	47079	47038	47038	Jack	580	" When can I see you again ? Tomorrow night?""I
47083	47085	47038	47038	Jack	580	""The day after?""I
47100	47105	47106	47106	He	580	""Damn it , Ella . "
47112	47132	47106	47106	He	580	" You can put it off for now , but you 'll just have to deal with it later . ""I'm
47141	47146	47106	47106	He	580	" I told him . "
47156	47371	47150	47150	I	970	"He gave me a smoldering glance and left , carrying the empty crib box with him . Slowly I cleared away the clutter in the kitchen and wiped the counters , and made Luke 's bottles . I kept stealing glances at the phone — it was about time for my nightly talk with Dane — but it remained silent . Was I obligated to tell him what had happened between me and Jack ? . . . Did an open relationship allow for secrets ? And if I confessed to Dane about the attraction I felt for Jack Travis , what good could possibly come of it?As I pondered the situation , I decided the only reason to tell Dane about the kiss was if it was leading to something . If I was becoming involved with Jack . And I was n't . The kiss was meaningless . Therefore , the wisest option — not to mention the easiest one — was to pretend it had never happened . And put off talking about it until the whole thing was forgotten . THE NEXT DAY I CALLED MY SISTER , I WAS FRUSTRATED but not especially surprised that Tara was dragging her feet on giving Dr. Jaslow permission to talk to me . "You
47386	47391	47373	47373	I	970	" I told her . "
47397	47423	47392	47392	I	970	""I'm doing fine by myself . You can talk to my doctor later . Maybe . But it 's not something I need right now . "
47507	47519	47498	47498	I	970	"Can you tell me just a little about what you 've been doing?"An
47527	47535	47524	47524	Tara	364	" I 've started taking an antidepressant . ""Good

She says the way we were raised was definitely not normal or healthy . And when your own mother is crazy and neglects you and competes with you , you have to figure out what that did to you as a child , and then you need to work on fixing it . Or . . .""Or
47644	47649	47634	47634	we	1069	" I said softly . "Yeah

47758	47804	47756	47756	Tara	364	""I want to confront Mom , try to make her understand what she did to us . But Dr. Jaslow says Mom will probably never get it . I could explain and explain , but Mom would deny it or say she does n't remember . ""I

47848	47858	47843	47843	Luke	2045	"Tara responded with a shy eagerness that touched me . "

48098	48130	48054	48054	mine	970	"It was difficult to keep from pointing out that since I 'd been recruited to take care of Luke at my own expense , it was partly my business , too . "

48484	48489	48476	48476	I	970	"You should ask Jack , "
48500	48546	48490	48490	Haven	819	" This is the kind of problem he 's really good with . He knows everyone . He 's not shy about calling in favors . And if I 'm not mistaken , I think the company has a couple of contracts with that church . "We

51311	51316	51318	51318	Luke	2045	" I said immediately . "
51357	51361	51362	51362	Jack	580	""He'll be fine , "
51375	51412	51362	51362	Jack	580	" God knows our dad was hardly ever around . And when he was , we could hardly wait to get rid of him . We grew up without a father , most of the time . ""And
51419	51817	51415	51415	we	1135	" Haven said . They glanced at each other , she and Jack , and burst out laughing as if at some absurdity . We had a casual dinner , and everyone took turns holding Luke . Haven continued to pour the sangria , and I drank until I was pleasantly giddy . I laughed more than I had in weeks . Months . I wondered what it meant , however , that I could enjoy the company of people who were so different from Dane and my friends in Austin . I was certain that Dane would find much to criticize about Hardy and Jack , both of them well versed in backroom deals and bending the rules . They were older than the men I was accustomed to , and far more cynical , and probably ruthless when it came to getting what they wanted . And yet so damnably charming . That was the danger , I thought . The affable manners and the charm , blinding you to what they really were . The kind of man who could control you , steer you into compromise after compromise , and make you think you were happy doing it . And only after you had walked into the trap would you realize the mistake you had made . The revelation was that even knowing this , I could be so attracted to a man like Jack Travis . I sat next to him on one of the deep velvet sofas , trying to identify the feeling that was stealing over me . I finally realized it was relaxation . I had never been an especially relaxed person , always wound tight and waiting for an emergency to strike . But tonight I was strangely at ease . Maybe it was because I was in a situation in which I had no need to protect myself or prove anything . Maybe it was the sleeping baby , warm and safe in my arms . As I settled back with Luke , I found myself tucked against Jack 's warm side , one of his arms extended along the sofa back . Closing my eyes , I let my cheek rest on his shoulder . Just for a moment . One of his hands came up to the side of my face , stroking my hair . "What
51828	51835	51826	51826	Haven	819	" I heard him ask mildly . "Nothing
51837	51845	51826	51826	Haven	819	" she said in a defensive tone . "
51865	51870	51871	51871	I	970	""I'm fine , too , "
51879	51884	51871	51871	I	970	" Just a Hi — "

51917	51968	51904	51904	Scotchguarded	201	" There was a tremor of laughter in Jack 's voice , and his hand moved over my hair . His fingers delved through the light , loose strands to my scalp and stroked tenderly . I closed my eyes again and held still , hoping he would n't stop . "What
51973	51979	51904	51904	Scotchguarded	201	" I mumbled , yawning . "Eight

52095	52105	52106	52106	we	1138	" Haven said , her face kind and concerned , "

52306	52358	52294	52296	the Austin guy	1141	" Jack replied in a tone of unqualified disdain . And although I wanted to say something in Dane 's defense , I was too exhausted to make a sound . Either I dozed more heavily or a long silence passed , because I did n't hear anything for a while . "Ella
52360	52387	52388	52388	Ella	0	" I eventually heard , and I shook my head in annoyance . I was so comfortable , and I wanted the voice to go away . "

By the time I finished washing my face and brushing my teeth , and went to the kitchen , Jack had already filled the bottles , put them in the refrigerator , and had settled Luke in the crib .

But I 'd be damn surprised if that happens . I think this situation is more permanent than you 'd like to admit . You 're a new mother , whether or not you had a chance to get ready for it . You 're going to burn out if you do n't take care of yourself . You need to sleep when the baby sleeps . You need to find daycare , or get a nanny or a go - to babysitter . ""I

53627	53698	53595	53595	him	580	" That half - assed excuse for a relationship was over the moment Dane told you not to bring the baby to Austin . You know what he should have said ? . . .

54374	54715	54328	54328	his	580	" Jack 's lips found mine , following insistently as I tried to evade him . His hand curled around the back of my neck , his fingers strong . A shock went through me , spurring my heart into a fast , frantic beat . He kissed me repeatedly , long indecent kisses , all slippery friction and hot silk . I gasped at the abrasion of his shaven jaw and cheeks , the insistent exploration of his tongue . Blindly I reached for his wrists , one behind my neck , one at my side , and I gripped hard , the tips of my nails digging into dense muscle . I did n't know if I was trying to pull his hands away or push them closer . He kept kissing me , exploring roughly , expertly . I let go of his wrists and molded against the arousing terrain of his body . I had never existed in such a purely physical compass , thinking nothing , aware of nothing . Only needing . Craving . He slid one hand to my bottom , urging me against the stiff , enticing pressure of his erection , and I was panting , arching in a desperate effort to keep him right there . His kisses gentled , his mouth absorbing the sounds that rose in my throat . I strained against him , sensation collecting , muscles tightening as his hand pressed me in a subtle rhythm . Nothing had ever been so delicious as his mouth , his body , the hands that urged me forward until our hips were rubbing in a lazy exact pulse . The tension gathered in a surge that promised release . . . wrenching , out - of - control , in - heat spasms that would cause me to die of humiliation . All that from a kiss and a fully clothed embrace . Not going to happen , I thought in panic , tearing my mouth from his . "Wait
54717	54743	54744	54744	I	970	" I said with difficulty , my fingers tangling helplessly in his shirt . My body throbbed in every extremity . My mouth felt swollen . "
54749	54774	54744	54744	I	970	"Jack looked down at me , his eyes heavy - lidded , his cheekbones and the bridge of his nose burnished with high color . "
54778	54783	54784	54784	We	1157	" he said thickly . "
54793	54937	54784	54784	We	1157	" Before I could make another sound , he bent to take my mouth again . This time there was intent in the rhythm , a shameless grinding deliberateness . He was pushing me , teasing , letting my squirming body carry the momentum . Taste , movement , hot rhythmic stroking , all pulled the ecstatic sensations into one forward direction . I jerked against him , giving a low cry . The rush was so powerful that I could n't keep up with my own heartbeat . I shivered and hunched and clenched my hands in his shirt . And Jack prolonged the pleasure , maintaining the unhurried sliding rhythm , knowing exactly what he was doing . As the last few twitches left my body , dissolving in a white - hot glow , I whimpered and sagged against him . "
54951	54968	54944	54944	You	1158	"Jack nipped at my chin , my scarlet cheek , the tender skin of my throat . "
54973	54977	54944	54944	You	1158	" he whispered . "
54985	55036	55037	55037	I	970	"We both fell silent , waiting for me to catch my breath . Pressed as close as we were , I could hardly keep from noticing that he was still aroused . What was the sexual etiquette for this ? I had an obligation to reciprocate , did n't I ? "
55040	55048	55049	55049	I	970	" I faltered after a long moment , "
55057	55066	55049	55049	I	970	"Jack 's midnight eyes were bright with amusement . "

At the table next to yours , there 's an old couple who looks like they 've been married at least fifty years . You and the guy take turns guessing the secret of a long marriage . He says it 's lots of great sex . You say it 's being with someone who can make you laugh every day . He says he can do both . "I
57483	57491	57368	57368	he	215	" Pretty sure of himself , is n't he?""Yeah
57513	57517	57368	57368	he	215	""He knows how to dance?"Jack
57520	57534	57536	57536	myself	970	" His mother made him take lessons when he was in grade school . "I
57592	57595	57596	57596	I	970	"Sounds fun , "
57609	57629	57596	57596	I	970	" Okay , what did Gottler say ? Or did you talk with his secretary ? Do we have a meeting?"Jack
57638	57684	57686	57686	him	2045	" Friday morning . I spoke with his secretary . When I mentioned maintenance contract issues , she tried to switch me over to another department . So I implied that it was a personal matter , that I might want to join the church . "I
57689	57710	57712	57712	he	2045	" Mark Gottler would agree to have a private meeting with you in the hopes of getting you to join the congregation?""Of

57805	57820	57801	57801	I	970	" I 'd be an atheist , except I believe in hedging my bets . ""I'm
57829	57836	57837	57837	You	1210	"I gave him an innocent glance . "
57873	57888	57869	57869	you	1210	God?""I'm not sure I should bring a little heathen like you into Eternal Truth . ""I
57900	57946	57890	57890	I	970	""First , darlin ' , that 's not saying much . Second , getting to a higher spiritual level is like increasing your credit score . You get a lot more points for sinning and repenting than if you have no credit history at all . "Reaching

57971	57983	57968	57968	I	970	" I would do anything including jump into the baptismal fountain . ""I'll

58022	58110	57968	57968	I	970	" * * * THE FELLOWSHIP OF ETERNAL TRUTH HAD ITS OWN Web site and Wikipedia page . The main pastor , Noah Cardiff , was a handsome man in his forties , married with five children . His wife , Angelica , was a slender , attractive woman who wore enough eyeshadow to recoat an RV roof . It quickly became apparent that Eternal Truth was more of an empire than a church . In fact , it was referred to in the Houston Chronicle as a "
58114	58431	57968	57968	I	970	" owning a small fleet of private jets , an airstrip , and real estate that included mansions , sports facilities , and its own publishing company . I was astonished to learn that Eternal Truth also had its own oil and gas field , run by a subsidiary company called Eternity Petrol Incorporated . The church employed over five hundred people and had a twelve - member board of directors , five of whom were Cardiff 's relatives . I could n't find any clips of Mark Gottler on YouTube , but I did find some of Noah Cardiff . He was charismatic and charming , making the occasional self - deprecating joke , assuring his worldwide congregation of all the good things their Creator had in store for them . He looked angelic , with his black hair and fair skin and blue eyes . In fact , watching the YouTube clip made me feel so good that if a collection plate had been passing by at that moment , I would have dropped twenty bucks in it . And if Cardiff had that effect on a feminist agnostic , there was no telling what a true believer might have been moved to donate . On Friday , the babysitter arrived at nine . Her name was Teena , and she seemed friendly and competent . I had gotten her name from Haven , who said Teena had done a great job with her nephew . I was worried about leaving Luke in anyone else 's care — it was the first time we had ever been separated — but it was also something of a relief to have a break . As we had agreed , I met Jack downstairs in the lobby . I was a few minutes late , having lingered to give a few last - minute instructions to Teena . "
58434	58453	58454	58454	I	970	" I quickened my stride as I walked toward Jack , who was standing by the concierge desk . "
58462	58466	58467	58467	Jack	580	""It 's fine , "
58470	58477	58478	58478	He	580	" We still have plenty of — "
58572	58577	58578	58578	I	970	"Do I look okay ? "
58618	58634	58638	58638	Jack	580	" I thought this was more appropriate for church than jeans and Birken - stocks . "I
58663	58669	58659	58659	he	580	" You have amazing legs . ""Thanks
58671	58678	58659	58659	he	580	" I gave a modest shrug . "
58681	58720	58721	58721	I	970	"That appeared to set off another round of thoughts . I thought Jack 's color seemed a little high , although it was difficult to tell with that rosewood tan . His voice sounded strained as he asked , "
58726	58738	58739	58739	I	970	flexible?""I was n't the most flexible in class by any means , "
58747	58758	58739	58739	I	970	" but I can put my ankles behind my head . "
58843	58846	58847	58847	I	970	"My God , "
58850	58856	58847	58847	I	970	" how many parking spaces are there?""Looks
58863	58872	58847	58847	I	970	" Jack replied , driving through the lot . "Welcome
58882	59303	58847	58847	I	970	" I muttered , preparing to dislike everything about Eternal Truth . When we went in , I was stunned by the grandeur of the place . The lobby was dominated by a gigantic LED screen showing film clips of happy families having picnics , walking through sunny neighborhoods , parents pushing children on swings , washing the dog , going to church together . Towering fifteen - foot - high statues of Jesus and the disciples stood near entrances to a food court and an atrium space lined with emerald glass . Panels of green malachite and warm cherry wood lined the walls , and acres of immaculate patterned carpeting covered the floor . The bookstore on the other side of the lobby was filled with people . Everyone seemed upbeat , people pausing to talk and laugh , while feel - good music wafted through the air . I had read that Eternal Truth was both admired and criticized for its health - and - wealth gospel . Pastor Cardiff emphasized often that God wanted his congregation to enjoy material prosperity as well as spiritual advancement . In fact , he insisted that the two went hand - in - hand . If one of the church members was having financial difficulty , he needed to pray harder for success . Money , it seemed , was a reward for faith . I did n't know nearly enough about theology to engage in a competent discussion . But I instinctively distrusted anything that was this slickly packaged and marketed . On the other hand . . . the people here seemed happy . If the doctrine worked for them , if it satisfied their needs , did I have any right to object ? Perplexed , I stopped with Jack as a smiling greeter came to us . After a brief murmured consultation , the greeter serenely directed us beyond a set of massive marble columns to an escalator , and we went upward into an airy space of sunlight and emerald glass , and a limestone cornice engraved with scripture : I CAME THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE AND HAVE IT ABUNDANTLY , JOHN 10:10A secretary was already waiting for us at the top of the escalator . She led us to an executive suite with a spacious conference room . There was a twenty - foot - long keystone table made of exotic woods , with a strip of colored printed glass running along the center . "Wow
59305	59335	58847	58847	I	970	" I said , surveying the leather executive chairs , the large mounted flat - screen TV , the data ports and individual monitors set up for video conferencing . "
59340	59344	59345	59345	I	970	"The secretary smiled . "
59354	59374	59348	59349	Pastor Gottler	225	"I glanced at Jack , who half - sat , half - leaned on the edge of the table . "
59384	59401	59377	59377	Jesus	223	" I asked as soon as the secretary left . He gave me a warning glance . "
59406	59448	59377	59377	Jesus	223	""According to what I 've read , Eternal Truth 's message is that God wants all of us to be rich and successful . So I guess you 're a little closer to heaven than the rest of us , Jack . ""If
59466	59501	59456	59456	I	970	""I ca n't help it . Something about this place bothers me . You were right — it is like Disneyland . And in my opinion they 're feeding their flock spiritual junk food . ""A
59509	59616	59507	59507	anyone	2046	" Jack said . The door opened , and a tall blond man entered the room . Mark Gottler was good - looking and swathed in an air of gentility . He was stocky and full - cheeked , well fed , well groomed . Gottler had an air of being above the flock , calmly accepting their reverence . You could n't imagine him being at the mercy of normal bodily functions . This was the man my sister had slept with?Gottler 's eyes were the color of melted Kraft caramels . He looked at Jack and went straight for him with an outstretched hand . "
59625	59670	59623	59623	Jack	580	" With his free hand , he briefly covered their clasped ones , making it a two - handed shake . One could take that either as a controlling gesture , or one of exceptional warmth . Jack 's pleasant expression did n't change . "I
59678	59709	59675	59676	a friend	580	" Gottler continued with a smile , reaching for me next . I shook his hand and was accorded the same two - handed grip . I pulled back irritably . "
59716	59725	59713	59714	Ella Varner	0	" I said before Jack could introduce us . "
59735	59760	59733	59733	Tara	364	"Gottler let go of me , staring . The glaze of politeness remained intact , but the air became cold enough to freeze vodka . "
59769	59778	59779	59779	She	2036	" he said , summoning a faint smile . "
59804	59807	59808	59808	I	970	right?""Close enough , "
59820	59834	59811	59811	Gottler	535	" I was led to believe you were coming to me for counsel . ""I
59837	59856	59811	59811	Gottler	535	" Jack said easily , pulling out a chair from the table and gesturing for me to sit . "
59878	59886	59876	59876	mine	1230	""How do you and Miss Varner know each other?""Ella
59894	59900	59888	59892	a good friend of mine	1231	"Gottler looked directly at me . "
59907	59993	59995	59995	Ella	0	here?"I shook my head , wondering how often he talked with her . Why would a married man in his profession take the risks that he had , having an affair with an unstable young woman and getting her pregnant ? It frightened me to comprehend that tens of millions of dollars — more — were at risk because of this situation . A sex scandal would be a huge blow to the church , not to mention the ruin of Mark Gottler 's career . "I
59997	60001	59995	59995	Ella	0	" Jack said , "
60017	60022	60024	60025	the baby	2045	" A deliberate pause . "
60027	60039	60024	60025	the baby	2045	" Taking the chair beside mine , he leaned back comfortably . "
60044	60048	60049	60049	Gottler	535	yet?""I'm afraid not . "
60070	60131	60060	60060	He	2045	" The church does what it can for our brothers and sisters in need , Jack . It may be that in the future I 'll have a chance to speak with Tara herself about what assistance we can provide for her . But that 's a private matter . I think Tara would rather keep it her own business . "I
60208	60215	60216	60216	I	970	"As you know , Mr. Gottler , "
60220	60255	60216	60216	I	970	" my sister is n't in a position to handle her own business . She 's vulnerable . Easy to take advantage of . That 's why I wanted to talk to you myself . "The
60261	60278	60216	60216	I	970	" Before we get into this any further , let 's take a moment to pray . ""I
60284	60288	60216	60216	I	970	" I began . "Sure
60290	60326	60216	60216	I	970	" Jack interrupted , nudging my leg under the table . He sent me a warning glance . Take it easy , Ella . I scowled and subsided , lowering my head . Gottler began . "
60372	60460	60470	60470	Lord	1243	."The prayer went on and on , until I came to the conclusion that Gottler was either stalling or trying to impress us with his elocution . Either way , I was impatient . I wanted to talk about Tara . I wanted decisions to be made . As I lifted my head to steal a glance at Gottler , I found that he was doing the same with me , sizing up the situation , assessing me as an adversary . And still he kept talking . "
60483	60491	60492	60492	I	970	and—""She 's my sister , not yours , "
60536	60543	60544	60544	Jack	580	"Let the man pray , Ella , "
60643	60660	60639	60639	Gottler	229	" May You grant us wisdom and profiting ears , almighty and merciful Lord . Amen . ""Amen
60662	60682	60639	60639	Gottler	229	" Jack and I both murmured , and we looked up . Jack 's hand slid away from me . "Mind
60688	60704	60639	60639	Gottler	229	" Jack asked Gottler , who nodded . Jack slid a questioning glance at me . "Sure
60706	60711	60639	60639	Gottler	229	" I muttered acidly . "
60722	60733	60719	60719	I	970	"Relaxed and soft - voiced , Jack said to Gottler , "
60774	60778	60779	60779	Gottler	535	""Good to hear , "
60785	60795	60796	60796	Jack	580	"I figure we 're all after the same thing , "
60799	60818	60796	60796	Jack	580	" For Tara and Luke to get situated , and everyone to go on with business as usual . ""The
60830	60835	60828	60828	Jack	580	" Gottler said reasonably . "
60885	60894	60895	60895	I	970	""What about a court - ordered paternity test ? "
60899	60913	60895	60895	I	970	" That would draw some attention , too , would n't it ? What about—""Easy
60917	60921	60922	60922	Mark	535	" Jack murmured . "
60934	60939	60940	60940	I	970	""I hope he is , "
60943	60969	60970	60970	Varner	364	" because paying for Tara 's stay at the clinic is only the beginning . I want a trust fund for the baby , and I want—""Miss
60972	60976	60970	60970	Varner	364	" Gottler said , "
60988	61001	60970	60970	Varner	364	" Faced with my ill - concealed scorn , he added meaningfully , "
61005	61008	61009	61009	Jack	580	""Sounds interesting , "
61026	61053	61009	61009	Jack	580	" Let 's hear the man out . Go on , Mark . . . what kind of benefits ? Are we talking some kind of housing deal?""That
61060	61065	61009	61009	Jack	580	" the pastor allowed . "
61098	61103	61083	61083	Tara	364	" Gottler paused thoughtfully . "
61145	61148	61149	61149	I	970	""By themselves ? "
61152	61164	61149	61149	I	970	" With things like utilities , landscaping , maintenance all taken care of?""That
61169	61173	61149	61149	I	970	" he allowed . "For
61177	61246	61253	61253	Mark	535	" I persisted . Gottler was silent . Clearly there were limits to what Eternal Truth was willing to do for Tara Varner , no matter that one of its chief clergy had knocked her up . Why did I have to be here prying something out of Mark Gottler that he should have already offered?My thoughts must have shown on my face , because Jack interceded quickly . "We're
61353	61437	61348	61349	the baby	2045	" Jack made a gesture to indicate the list was longer than he cared to enumerate . Gottler made a comment about having to get clearance from his board of directors , and then Jack smiled and said he could n't picture Gottler having a problem there , and for the next few minutes I listened , half - impressed and half - disgusted . They finished with the acknowledgment that both sides were going to let their lawyers hash out the details . "
61449	61455	61348	61349	the baby	2045	" Gottler was telling Jack . "
61467	61473	61474	61474	I	970	""We sprang it on you ? "
61481	61510	61474	61474	I	970	" You had nine months to consider all this . It has n't occurred to you until now that you might be obligated to do something for Luke ? "
61511	61514	61515	61515	Gottler	535	" Luke , "
61522	61528	61529	61529	He	535	" Is that his name ? "
61536	61540	61529	61529	He	535	" Of course . ""Why
61546	61573	61574	61574	We	1270	" I demanded , but he only responded with a humorless smile and a shake of his head . Jack urged me to stand with him . "
61613	61618	61620	61620	us	1270	""Sure thing , Jack . "Gottler
61681	61687	61688	61688	I	970	1:37"Where does that door lead ? "
61691	61697	61698	61699	A man	2127	"To my offices , actually . "

61744	61761	61740	61740	Jack	580	" A pleasure , Mr. Travis . I had the chance to meet your father recently . "Jack

61822	61989	61990	61991	Miss Varner	0	" Laughing quietly , Cardiff turned to me . He was dazzling . A big man , though not quite so tall as Jack , and built on a more slender scale . Whereas Jack looked and moved like an athlete , Noah Cardiff had the grace of a dancer . It was striking to see the two side by side , Jack with his sexy , earthy appeal , and Cardiff , refined and austerely beautiful . The pastor 's complexion was fair , the kind that blushed easily , and his nose was narrow and high - bridged . The smile was angelic and slightly rueful , the smile of a mortal man who was all too aware of human frailty . And the eyes were those of a saint , benevolent light blue , his gaze making you feel annointed in some way . As he stepped close enough to shake my hand , I caught the scents of lavender and amber spice . "
62009	62020	62021	62021	Varner	0	" Pausing , he sent a quizzical smile to Gottler . "

Disgruntled and riled and roasting — it would be a while before the air - conditioning would make any headway against the braised interior of the car — I was quiet for a while . I saw my sister differently than Jack did . I loved her . But did that prevent me from seeing the truth ? Did Jack have a better grasp of the situation than I did?I heard my cell phone ring . Reaching for my handbag , I dug around until I found the phone . "
63036	63048	63034	63034	Dane	105	" I said tersely . He rarely called during the day . "

63102	63164	63090	63090	sweetie	723	" I gave Dane the in - a - nutshell version , and he listened with reassuring sympathy , making none of the judgments that Jack had . It was a relief to talk to someone who did n't push my buttons . I found myself relaxing , the air - conditioning blowing over me like the breath of a glacier . "Hey
63170	63174	63166	63166	I	970	" Dane said , "
63226	63235	63237	63237	I	970	"I froze until Dane added with a laugh , "

63744	63767	63768	63768	I	970	"Jack 's voice was soft , but it contained a savage note that caused all the hairs on my body to rise . "

63890	63926	63874	63874	I	970	" You see , this is why I will always choose Dane , or someone like him , over you . I will never be told what to do . I 'm an independent woman . ""Chicken
63929	63954	63874	63874	I	970	" I heard him mutter . His breathing was n't any better than mine . In a rage , I whirled to face him . "
63955	64017	63874	63874	I	970	What?""This does n't have fuck - all to do with independence . You 're scared because you know if you start something with me , it 'll go to a place you and Dane never went . He wo n't stand by you — he 's already proved it . He went pussy on you . And now he gets laid for that?""Shut
64020	64138	64139	64139	I	970	" I had had enough . And I , who had never struck anyone in my life , hit the side of Jack 's arm with my handbag , which happened to be a heavy leather hobo . It made a loud thwack , but he did n't appear to notice . The elevator door opened , the empty cab shedding light over gray concrete and tile . Neither of us made a move to get in , just stood and glared at each other as the argument gathered force . Taking me by the wrist , Jack hauled me around the side of the elevator bank , into a dark corner scented with exhaust and oil . "
64143	64147	64139	64139	I	970	" he muttered . "
64180	64182	64183	64183	I	970	"Unbelievable , "

64245	64249	64242	64242	you	970	" I demanded . "
64255	64282	64242	64242	you	970	funny?""I was just thinking if the sex with you is one - tenth as fun as arguing with you , I 'll be one happy bastard . "

65566	65594	65555	65555	I	970	""Sweetheart . I did n't mean for it to happen like this . Come to my bed . Let me make love to you the right way . "

A man exited and went to his car , his footsteps a hollow - sounding echo on the concrete . I waited until the car had left the parking garage before I spoke to Jack . "
65717	65722	65640	65640	I	970	" I said unsteadily . "
65785	65796	65776	65776	I	970	" Hesitantly I reached up to stroke his taut jaw . "

The person I need to make decisions with is Dane . If there 's any room for you in my life after that , you 'll be the first to know . "It
65984	65988	65976	65976	he	580	" Damn it . "
66003	66033	65989	65989	He	580	" I 've got about ten things I want to say to you right now . But at least nine of them would make me sound like a psycho . "In
66046	66053	66042	66042	I	970	" What 's the tenth thing ? "
66065	66069	66070	66070	he	580	" Never mind , "
66073	66086	66070	66070	he	580	" That one would make me sound like a psycho , too . "Guiding
66164	66175	66176	66176	I	970	"You do n't have to walk me to the door , "
66238	66347	66231	66231	His	580	"Jack—"He kissed me roughly . My lips parted at the demanding pressure . It was a lewd , scorching , brain - demolishing kiss . . . not that there was much left to demolish . I pushed against him , trying to end it , but he kept on until I went boneless against him . Only then did he pull his head back , glancing down at me with hunger and a flash of belligerent male triumph . Apparently he felt he had made some kind of point . It flashed through my mind that this entire event had been a form of territory - marking . "
66353	66406	66348	66348	Men	487	" Stacy was fond of saying . And she usually went on to add that , like dogs , they all took up too much space on the bed , and they always went for the crotch . Somehow I pushed the correct combination on the keypad and went into the apartment . "Ella—""I'm
66415	66433	66435	66435	Ella	0	" I said . Before he could reply , I closed the door firmly in his face . "Hi
66437	66446	66435	66435	Ella	0	" the babysitter , Teena , said cheerfully . "
66452	66457	66435	66435	Ella	0	go?""Just fine . How 's Luke?""All
66470	66485	66462	66462	I	970	"The mobile was playing gently , bears and honeypots turning in a lazy circle . "Any
66492	66496	66498	66498	he	1327	" I asked . "Well
66514	66518	66510	66510	he	1327	" Teena laughed . "
66530	66700	66701	66701	you	1330	"My heart skipped a beat . Mommy . I thought about correcting her , but it did n't seem worth the effort . I gave Teena some cash , let her out of the apartment , and I went to take a shower . The hot water soothed and relaxed me , easing my aches and twinges . It did nothing for my guilt , however . For the first time I experienced the two - pronged remorse of having cheated on someone . . . remorse for having done it in the first place , and also for having enjoyed it so much . Sighing , I wrapped a towel around my hair , put on a robe , and went to check on Luke . The mobile had stopped , and everything was quiet . Tiptoeing to the side of the crib , I peeked in , expecting to see the baby sleeping . But he was staring up at me in that somber way of his . "Aren't
66707	66712	66705	66705	Luke	2045	" I asked softly . "
66717	66843	66845	66845	you	1331	for?"The second he saw me , he moved and kicked , and his mouth curled in a baby - grin . His first smile . It startled me , that spontaneous reaction to seeing me . It 's you . I 've been waiting for you . And I felt a lovely ache that went right down to my soul , and I forgot everything except that moment . I had earned that smile . I wanted to earn a million more from him . Without thinking I reached for Luke and lifted him from the crib , exuberantly kissing his warm little face , his smiling mouth . I inhaled his powdery , diapery , innocent smell . I had never known such happiness . "Look
66847	66856	66705	66705	Luke	2045	" I murmured , nuzzling into his neck . "
66876	66883	66864	66864	you	1331	" My boy . My Luke . FIFTEEN"WOW
66885	66925	66864	66864	you	1331	" DANE SAID WHEN HE WALKED INTO THE apartment , after a prolonged hug at the door . He glanced at the designer decorating , the big windows and show - off view , and gave an appreciative whistle . "It
66934	67090	66864	66864	you	1331	" I asked with a grin . Dane was the same as always , warm and easygoing and handsome . He was shorter and leaner than Jack , with the result being that we fit together perfectly when we hugged . Seeing him reminded me instantly of all the reasons I had gotten together with him in the first place . He was the man who knew me better than anyone , who never set me off - balance . It was rare to find people in life you knew were never going to hurt you , or screw you over with moral manipulations . Dane was one of them . I showed Luke to him , and he admired the baby dutifully , watching as I settled Luke into his baby bouncer . I attached a hoop of interesting toys for Luke to look at , and sat next to Dane on the sofa . "I
67101	67105	66864	66864	you	1331	" Dane said . "I'm
67108	67141	67142	67142	I	970	" I took Luke 's hand and showed him how to push a plastic puppy from one side of the hoop to the other . Luke flailed at it with a grunt . "
67158	67162	67163	67163	Dane	105	"You look different , "
67179	67181	67182	67182	I	970	"Tired , "

67387	67395	67377	67377	Dane	105	" What , not in front of the baby?"I
67403	67411	67377	67377	Dane	105	" I guess . I . . . "
67427	67436	67437	67437	I	970	" I have some stuff to tell you , "

67513	67578	67508	67508	Dane	105	" Sweetie , I 'm pretty good at reading between the lines . And I ca n't help but notice that every time you and I talk , someone else 's name keeps coming up in the conversation . So let me start this off for you : ' Dane , lately I 've been spending a lot of time with Jack Travis . . .""Lately
67591	67623	67588	67589	Jack Travis	580	" I said , and a couple of tears spilled over . Dane looked patient and unsurprised . He took one of my hands and held it in both of his . "
67635	67638	67639	67639	You	580	"I sniffled . "
67640	67646	67639	67639	You	580	can?""I've always been your friend . "I

67740	67754	67734	67734	he	2045	" Dane said , looking into my woeful face with a wry smile . "
67762	67774	67775	67775	I	970	"I sat next to him and let out a wobbly sigh . "
67815	67828	67806	67806	I	970	""There 's nothing you ca n't tell me . You know that . ""Yes

But I said enough for him to understand that my carefully considered approach to life was unraveling , and I was obsessively attracted to a man I should never have been attracted to , and I was at a complete loss to know why .

68350	68423	68346	68346	I	970	" We get started and it 's like sex , this back - and - forth , and we 're both so there , do you know what I mean ? We rattle each other . And some conversations seem to be happening on a few different levels at once . But even when we 're disagreeing on something , there 's a weird kind of harmony in it . A connection . "Dane

68949	69006	68940	68940	God	130	" he said , and I got up to get us a couple of drinks we badly needed . * * * I TRIED CALLING JACK THE NEXT DAY . AFTER LEAVING two messages on his cell phone , I realized he was in no hurry to call me back . That worried and annoyed me . "I
69013	69024	69025	69025	Jack	580	" Haven said when I called her in the afternoon . "
69077	69093	69094	69094	I	970	""I had to resolve a couple of things with Dane when he came to visit , "
69097	69115	69094	69094	I	970	" So I asked Jack for a little space . Guess he did n't take it well . "Haven
69123	69152	69154	69154	he	580	" No , he did not . But I 've never gotten the impression that he 's especially good at backing off when he wants some - thing . ""Well
69163	69168	69169	69169	He	580	" I said ruefully . "
69176	69204	69169	69169	He	580	""Ella , I probably should n't stick my nose in Jack 's business , since I 've always been so pissed off when he 's done that to me—""Go
69207	69211	69212	69212	I	970	" I urged . "
69232	69234	69235	69235	Haven	819	""Okay , "
69239	69305	69235	69235	Haven	819	" I think Jack is so twisted up and turned around , he does n't know what to do . He 's not used to feeling jealous about anyone . He always plays it cool , always has the upper hand , and I think you 've gotten to him in a major way . And I have to say , I 'm enjoying this . ""Why
69307	69317	69320	69320	Jack	580	" I asked , giddy with hope and nerves . "I've
69384	69389	69365	69365	I	970	""Can I tell you something confidential?""Yes
69391	69418	69365	69365	I	970	what?""Jack made a huge deal out of the fact that Dane was staying at my apartment . He wanted Dane to stay in a hotel room . ""Well
69460	69484	69450	69450	he	105	""I know . But Dane did stay at my apartment last night . And I 'm wondering if Jack might have found out . "Haven
69487	69518	69450	69450	he	105	" Ella , nothing goes on in this building that Jack does n't know about . He probably told the concierge to let him know the exact time Dane left . ""I
69526	69531	69524	69524	Dane	105	" I said defensively . "You
69541	69613	69524	69524	Dane	105	""It was terrible . Dane started off sleeping on the sofa , but the baby 's crying kept him awake , until finally I sent Dane into the bedroom and then I stayed on the sofa . I can tell you with authority that after last night , Dane will never voluntarily reproduce . So now Dane 's fled back to Austin , and Jack apparently is n't speaking to me . "Haven
69616	69635	69636	69636	you	2058	" Poor Ella . My guess is that Jack is just trying to figure out his next move . ""If
69647	69715	69642	69642	you	2058	me?""No , I 've got a better idea . My dad 's birthday is tomorrow night . The woman he 's dating — Vivian — is throwing a party for him at the family home in River Oaks . All the Travises are going to be there , including Jack and my other brothers and my sister - in - law . Come with me and Hardy . ""I
69725	69730	69732	69733	my guest	1367	" I said uneasily . "You'll

69834	69847	69828	69828	he	580	"Yes . It 's semicasual — do you have a cute dress to wear?""I
69855	69874	69828	69828	he	580	""Yes . That 's his favorite color . Oh , Ella , this is going to be fun . "
69875	69881	69882	69882	I	970	" For you , maybe , "
70140	70146	70147	70147	Haven	819	"You'll enjoy this , Ella , "
70163	70203	70158	70158	Hardy	169	" Vivian throws great parties — the food and music are always terrific . She 's only had one bomb that I know of , and it was so epic that it actually ended up being sort of cool . ""Why
70207	70245	70158	70158	Hardy	169	bomb?""Well , Peter Jackson was one of the guests of honor , so Vivian did a Lord of the Rings homage . She dug up the whole backyard and had it redone with waterfalls and rock formations . ""That
70252	70256	70158	70158	Hardy	169	" I said . "No
70300	70304	70295	70295	He	2044	" Haven paused . "

70498	70505	70488	70489	The singer	1409	" Steppin ' Out With My Baby "
70552	70560	70561	70561	I	970	"I've been to parties before . . . "
70586	70590	70573	70573	Hardy	169	" I know . "
70745	70755	70756	70756	Haven	819	"Let 's get Dad out of the way first , "
70799	70807	70808	70808	I	970	"Do you think Jack is here yet ? "
70811	70821	70822	70822	you	1418	"No , he never comes to a party early . ""Did
70828	70833	70834	70834	I	970	me?"Haven shook her head . "
70852	71269	70841	70841	He	169	"Jack had called me in the morning , but I had been in the shower and let the machine pick up . He had left a curt message that he had a meeting at the Woodlands north of Houston , and would be gone most of the day . By the time I called back , I had gotten his voice mail . I did n't leave a message , figuring he deserved some payback after he 'd avoided my calls the previous day . It took a while for us to make our way through the main circuit of rooms . Between the two of them , Haven and her fiancé knew everyone . A waiter came by with a tray of champagne in iced glasses . I took one and drank gratefully , the vintage dry and sparkling - crisp on my tongue . Standing near an original Frida Kahlo painting , I took in my surroundings while Haven skillfully fended off a woman who was determined to have her join the Houston Orchid Society . The guests encompassed a wide variety of ages , the women all wearing perfect makeup and impossibly high heels , the men carefully groomed and well dressed . I was glad I was wearing my best dress , a fluid pale blue knit that wrapped across my breasts in a figure - flattering vee . It was a simple , classic dress that made me look voluptuous , the knee - length hem showing off my legs . I was wearing silver high - heeled sandals , which I had worried were a little over the top until I saw what the other women were wearing . The Houston definition of semicasual seemed to include a generous quantity of jewelry and embellishment , in contrast to Austin semicasual , which basically entailed wearing a shirt and shoes . I had put on more eye makeup than usual , using smoky gray eyeshadow and two coats of mascara . My lips were slicked with delicate pink gloss . I had turned the ends of my bob up into a neat flip , which I could feel swinging against my cheeks every time I turned my head . There had been no need for blush — my cheeks were touched with a natural flush that was fever - colored in its intensity . I knew something was going to happen that night , something either very good or very bad . "He
71273	71288	70841	70841	He	169	" Hardy reported to Haven , who gestured for me to come with them . "Jack
71290	71295	71297	71298	my dad	2058	" I asked bemusedly . "No
71300	71309	71297	71298	my dad	2058	" Haven grinned and made a comical face . "
71321	71404	71297	71298	my dad	2058	"We pushed our way through the back of the house out to a vast landscaped lawn . Trees had been webbed with white lights , glittering canopies stretched high over a crowded dance floor . Guests sat on chairs and swarmed around food - laden buffet tables . I was awestruck by the sight of the birthday cake positioned on its own table , a four - foot - tall chocolate creation tied with gum paste ribbons and littered with fondant butterflies . "Wow
71406	71422	71297	71298	my dad	2058	" I remarked to an older man who had just turned away from a group . "
71442	71445	71446	71446	he	2058	thing?""Hope not , "
71453	71463	71446	71446	he	2058	" They might catch fire from all the candles . "I
71466	71485	71488	71488	him	2058	" Yes , and all that frosting would make the stop , drop , and roll so messy . "
71495	71528	71531	71531	he	2058	" Ella Varner , from Austin . Are you a friend of the Travises ? Never mind , of course you are . They would n't invite one of their enemies , would they?"He
71555	71565	71566	71566	He	1423	" They would especially invite one of their enemies . "
71647	71654	71655	71655	I	970	" Happy birthday , Mr. Travis , "
71662	71668	71670	71670	Ella	0	"Thank you , Miss Varner . ""Call
71691	71697	71698	71698	You	970	it?"Churchill Travis continued to smile . "
71725	71733	71735	71735	you	970	"The flirty old fox . I grinned . "
71740	71741	71742	71742	Churchill	105	" "
71744	71760	71742	71742	Churchill	105	"Haven came up to her father and stood on her toes to kiss his cheek . "
71801	71808	71796	71796	She	0	"A new voice entered the conversation . "
71821	71854	71855	71855	Travis	580	"I turned to the man who was just behind me . I was startled to see a younger , lankier version of Jack , still on the early side of his twenties . "Joe
71857	71911	71855	71855	Travis	580	" he said , shaking my hand firmly . He was nearly a head taller than his father . Joe had n't yet grown into the seasoned masculine prime that his older brother Jack had attained , but he was a charmer , and a head - turner , and he knew it . "Do
71918	71923	71924	71924	Joe	177	" Haven said severely . "
71957	71968	71969	71969	You	1431	"Hardy heard the last comment as he joined the group . "
71977	72001	72002	72002	I	970	" he asked Joe , and Haven elbowed him sharply . Joe kept my hand in his and gave me a soulful glance . "
72021	72026	72027	72027	Haven	819	""Joe , you fink , "
72031	72044	72027	72027	Haven	819	" do n't even think of hitting on your brother 's girlfriend . ""I'm
72050	72063	72066	72066	she	105	" I said hastily . Joe shot his sister a triumphant glance . "
72071	72089	72066	72066	she	105	"Hardy interrupted the brewing squabble by handing a leather double - finger cigar case to Churchill Travis . "
72095	72100	72093	72093	sir	105	""Thank you , Hardy . "
72119	72132	72133	72133	Hardy	169	"There 's a full box of those for you in the house , "
72137	72139	72140	72140	Churchill	105	"Cohibas ? "
72170	72187	72166	72166	his	105	" All I know is they got Honduran wrappers . Ca n't account for the insides . "Definitely
72209	72224	72226	72226	sir	105	" We 'll share a couple of these on the porch later , Hardy . ""Yes
72228	72408	72411	72411	Jack	580	"Glancing around Joe 's shoulder , I caught sight of someone standing beside one of the open French doors , and my heart clutched . It was Jack , his lean athletic form clad in a black knit shirt and black pants . He looked sexy , lithe , ready to commit some hi - tech heist . Although his posture was relaxed , one hand shoved casually into a pocket , the tense dark line of his body cleaved the sparkling scene like a rip in a glossy magazine photograph . Jack 's mouth held a brooding tension as he conversed with the woman who stood with him . I felt a little sick as I watched the two of them . She was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen , with a long fall of buttermilk - colored hair , and sculpted screen - goddess features , and an ultra - slim body displayed in a tiny scrap of a black dress . They appeared to be together . Joe followed my gaze . "
72413	72419	72411	72411	Jack	580	""He 's brought a date , "
72425	72453	72454	72454	she	1435	"No , he has n't . That 's Ashley Everson . She 's married . But she heads for Jack like a barracuda whenever she sees him . ""Is
72462	72471	72454	72454	she	1435	" I whispered . Joe 's head bent . "
72476	72481	72483	72483	she	1435	" he whispered back , "
72508	72514	72503	72503	they	1438	""Do you think he . . .""No
72516	72521	72522	72522	Jack	580	" Joe said instantly . "
72539	72621	72622	72622	Ella	0	"I was about to protest that I was n't competing , but at that moment Jack looked up and saw me . I could n't even breathe . His midnight eyes widened . His gaze dragged slowly down to my silver sandals and back up again . Straightening , he pulled his hand from his pocket and started toward me . Looking perturbed , Ashley Everson caught at his arm and said something to him , and he paused to reply . "
72624	72743	72744	72744	Travis	580	" Haven 's voice drew my attention . Someone new had joined the group , yet another tall dark - haired man , who could only have been a Travis . The oldest , Gage . Although he bore his father 's stamp , he did n't resemble the other two sons nearly as much . There was nothing of the cowboy in him . . . his features were refined and reserved , his handsomeness nearly prodigal . The eyes were not coffee - brown but an unusual light gray , the color of dry ice contained in dark rims . When he smiled , I felt as if I 'd been given a reprieve from something . "Gage
72746	72765	72769	72769	Liberty	248	" he introduced himself , and put his arm around a woman who had just come to him . "
72771	72815	72769	72769	Liberty	248	"She was a gorgeous woman with a perfect oval face and an easy smile , her skin a pale , shimmery butter - scotch . As she leaned forward to shake my hand , her dark hair moved around her shoulders like liquid . "
72823	72827	72821	72821	Ella	0	" she said . "
72835	72848	72849	72849	We	1441	"I certainly did n't want to present myself as Jack 's girlfriend . "
72856	72863	72867	72867	he	580	" I said uncomfort - ably . "
72909	72912	72897	72897	I	970	but—""We're together , "
73063	73080	73053	73053	Jack	580	" Happy birthday , Dad . Brought you a present — it 's in the house . "The
73091	73114	73081	73082	Travis patriarch	1445	" You know what present I want ? For you to settle down and get married , and give me some grandbabies . "Jack
73132	73140	73141	73141	he	1445	" You 've already got a grandson , "
73146	73153	73141	73141	he	1445	"I'd like more before I go . "Jack
73157	73164	73165	73165	I	970	" Where you planning on going , Dad?""All
73198	73203	73204	73204	Joe	177	""Good Lord , Dad , "
73207	73228	73204	73204	Joe	177	" If Jack got any busier in that department , he 'd have to carry around a deli - counter ticket machine—""Joe
73230	73253	73204	73204	Joe	177	" Gage murmured , and that was enough to quiet the youngest brother . Churchill cast a pointedly approving glance at me . "

73278	73299	73271	73271	I	970	" I said . Churchill 's brows lifted as if he 'd never heard a woman say such a thing . "
73301	73311	73271	73271	I	970	not?""I'm very into my career , for one thing . ""Too
73314	73318	73271	73271	I	970	" Jack said . "
73336	73368	73369	73369	You	1447	"I laughed . Jack 's expression softened as he looked down at me , and he stroked back a strand of light , glinting hair that had fallen over my forehead . "
73374	73378	73271	73271	I	970	" he murmured , "
73386	73402	73406	73406	her	1450	" Without waiting for an answer , he began to draw me away with him . "I
73408	73412	73413	73413	I	970	" Churchill protested . "
73419	73428	73413	73413	I	970	"Jack paused and shot him an ironic glance . "
73446	73456	73457	73457	I	970	" As he pulled me away , Jack said , "
73461	73479	73457	73457	I	970	""About your father ? . . . No , do n't be sorry . I liked him . "

73828	73853	73855	73855	Dane	105	"Jack nodded slightly , but the set of his face remained austere , rigid , as if it had been fired in a kiln . "No
73857	73871	73855	73855	Dane	105	" he eventually said with unnerving finality . I tried to be funny . "

74471	74555	74556	74556	He	580	"There was n't much conversation on the way back to 1800 Main . The feelings between us were too raw . I had n't yet known Jack long enough to feel much comfortable ease with him.—our relationship needed to be broken in . But I did tell Jack about the talk I 'd had with Dane , and he listened closely . I realized that although Jack comprehended Dane 's views , on a visceral level he did n't get him at all . "

75419	75465	75467	75467	you	1478	"My breathless laugh ended with a gasp as Jack reached out and tugged gently at the tiny snaps that held the front of my dress closed . The sides listed open , unveiling the full round shapes of my breasts , my white silk panties . "Look
75469	75473	75467	75467	you	1478	" he whispered . "
75484	75650	75467	75467	you	1478	" He eased the dress off my shoulders until it dropped to the floor . A severe blush spread from head to toe as I stood there in high heels and panties . Clumsy with urgency , I tugged at his black shirt , and Jack moved to help me strip it off . His chest was powerful and emphatically defined , the large muscles mortared with smaller ones in between . Hesitantly I touched the rough dark hair on his chest , drew my fingers through it . He felt maddeningly good . I let him pull me closer , his arms wrapping around me , and my hands slipped around to his back . The tickling brush of hair against my breasts , the long , delicious kisses , flooded me with sensation . Feeling the way I had molded myself against his body , my hips urgently cradling the shape of his erection , Jack eased me back with a smothered laugh . "
75654	75658	75659	75659	I	970	""I need you , "
75696	75720	75688	75688	Jack	580	" . . .you know if you start something with me , it 'll go to a place you and Dane never went . "
75792	75798	75783	75783	He	580	"I guess . . . , "
75805	75817	75799	75799	I	970	" I do n't feel all - the - way safe . ""Probably
75823	75839	75819	75819	you	1481	" Jack hooked his fingers at the side of my panties , drawing them down . "
75858	75894	75849	75849	you	1481	"Feeling dazed , I let him take off the panties , and I obeyed his urging to sit on the edge of the bed . I tried to reach for one of the silver shoes . "No
75896	75929	75849	75849	you	1481	" Jack murmured , sinking to his haunches in front of me . He pushed my thighs open with his hands , his face intent . I tried to close against him . "
75933	76202	75849	75849	you	1481	" I said bashfully But Jack pinned me in place , and despite my wriggling objection , he leaned forward and pressed his mouth against me , there , in a full searching kiss . In a matter of seconds I was moaning , frozen in place as the pleasure surged and buzzed with each silky flick of his tongue . It went on and on until the desire was too much , and I clutched his head hard and close . He took my wrists , pulling them down to my sides , and just held them there . Manacled in his grip , spread open , I breathed in low cries as he gnawed and licked and ate gently into the softness , and the sensation built until my inner muscles began a frantic , involuntary clenching . Jack pulled back , leaving me floundering . I was weak , desperate , my pulse brutal in its force . As he stood between my thighs , I reached for the front of his pants to unfasten them . My hands felt encumbered , as if I were wearing mittens . Jack was heavily aroused , his erection taut and dusky . I touched him in wonder , gripped the pulsing heft , breathed against the engorged head . He went still , and I heard a faint groan . He tolerated my careful touch , the warm suction of my mouth as I tried to taste as much of him as possible . But in a matter of seconds he was easing me away , muttering , "
76225	76530	76222	76222	Ella	0	."Stripping off his clothes , he joined me on the bed and tugged me toward the center of the mattress . He took interminable minutes to remove my shoes , unbuckling the tiny straps when it would have sufficed to slip them over my heels . And then he was over me again , his mouth at my breasts , one of his thighs nudging insistently between mine . I reached up to him , my palm flattening on the flexing surface of his back . His mouth found mine , and I went pliant , supine , moaning and resistless . Clasping me securely , he eased us to our sides , his hands venturing everywhere . Our entwined bodies turned in a slow revolution across the wide bed . It was a sensual altercation , the way we rubbed and slid , with me trying to entice him inside and Jack resisting . He delayed and teased and tormented my aching flesh until I begged him in a hoarse whisper to do it now , I was ready , now , now — He rolled me to my back and spread my legs wide . I complied with an expectant groan , tilting my hips up . He eased inside me , and the entire world seemed to stop as I felt the low , thick slide . I clutched at his shoulders , my nails indenting his skin . Pushing deeper into my shrinking body , Jack murmured that he would be gentle , just relax , relax . . . and he went deeper and held , while I felt myself yield by slow degrees . His face was right over mine , his eyes as dark and bright as hellfire . He stroked the hair back from my forehead . "
76542	76617	76618	76618	You	1482	" he whispered . I nodded as if in a trance . His lips caught at mine . He nudged within the wet constriction of my body , gentle in the way only a big man could be . He was sensitive to every breath and heartbeat , searching for a perfect bias of flesh and movement , and when he found it , I cried out helplessly . Jack nearly purred in satisfaction . "
76624	76628	76618	76618	You	1482	Ella?""Yes . Yes . "
76847	76849	76850	76850	Jack	580	"Rest , "
76861	76863	76850	76850	Jack	580	"Can't , "
76867	76875	76876	76876	He	1482	" Downstairs . The babysitter . . . "
76890	76903	76881	76881	His	1482	" Just for a few minutes . I 'll watch over you . "Burrowing
76977	76996	77001	77001	he	1482	" That was the best I ever had , Ella . There 's not even a close second . "I
77078	77085	77086	77086	he	1482	" Your skin is so soft , "
77089	77113	77086	77086	he	1482	" And your hair is so silky . I love the way you feel . . . the way you move . . . "
77125	77152	77114	77114	His	1482	" I want you to trust me , Ella . I want every part of you . Someday you 're going to let go with me . "I
77225	77235	77236	77236	I	970	" I just had sex with the light on , "
77239	77248	77236	77236	I	970	" For God 's sake , is n't that enough?"He
77296	77307	77308	77308	I	970	" I saw you with Ashley tonight at the party , "
77312	77318	77308	77308	I	970	" She 's very beautiful . "Jack
77325	77336	77341	77341	you	1485	" That fades the more you get to know her . ""What
77343	77354	77356	77357	her husband	2362	about?""She 's bitching to everyone about her problems with Pete . ""That
77361	77375	77360	77360	he	2362	there?""Yeah . They seemed to be doing their best to avoid each other . ""I
77385	77389	77360	77360	he	2362	" I mused . "Wouldn't
77395	77400	77360	77360	he	2362	" Jack said dryly . "That
77429	77432	77433	77433	Jack	580	""Not everything . "
77455	77462	77463	77463	I	970	"Do you think she loved you ? "
77466	77476	77463	77463	I	970	" I mean , sincerely loved you?He sighed tautly . "
77491	77495	77463	77463	I	970	" He paused . "
77504	77507	77463	77463	I	970	""Ruined it ? "
77536	77541	77542	77542	Ashley	247	" How did you do that?""When
77552	77576	77548	77548	she	247	" Jack broke off with an unsettled breath . I climbed over him fully , draping myself over his hard , furry chest . "
77584	77602	77603	77603	You	1491	" I reached to the ruffled disorder of his hair and slid my fingers through it gently . "
77608	77630	77631	77631	She	247	"Jack looked away from me , his profile as hard and perfect as a face on a new - minted coin . "
77645	77647	77648	77648	I	970	""Oh . "
77672	77676	77677	77677	I	970	" Were you ? "
77688	77730	77677	77677	I	970	" Or was Ashley trying to put all the blame on you for the fact that she cheated ? Because I 've never been a big fan of the look - what - you - made - me - do defense . "The
77737	77776	77777	77777	He	1492	" Ashley sure as hell never took responsibility for anything . But the truth is , I probably was a pain in the ass . I do n't do things half - measure , including falling in love . "
77780	77787	77777	77777	He	1492	" I have a possessive streak . "He
77811	77815	77816	77816	I	970	" No kidding , "
77819	77839	77816	77816	I	970	" The good thing is , jack , I have no problem telling you where to draw the line . "I
77843	77856	77816	77816	I	970	"We stared at each other as smiles started on both our faces . "So
77858	77862	77864	77864	Ashley	247	" I said , "
77892	77909	77910	77910	His	1492	""No , that had nothing to do with Ashley . I just happen to like sex . "
77918	77921	77910	77910	His	1492	"No kidding . "
77938	77944	77922	77922	I	970	" I need a shower . "Jack
78005	78014	78017	78017	me	970	" Why is there a car wash in your bathroom?"Jack
78063	78070	78071	78071	Jack	580	"Aren't you going to come in ? "
78127	78138	78139	78139	I	970	"I hate to be the one to tell you this , "
78142	78160	78139	78139	I	970	" but you need to start exercising . A man your age should n't let himself go . "He
78187	78192	78193	78193	I	970	" I 'm drowning , "
78212	78222	78225	78225	Ella	0	" I wonder how much water we 're wasting . ""You

78476	78492	78469	78469	Jack	580	" I thought everything about you was so cute , I could hardly stand it . ""Cute?""In
78497	78512	78513	78513	I	970	"'"I thought you were sexy in a jerky kind of way . You 're — "
78526	78534	78520	78520	his	580	" — not at all my type . "I
78542	78557	78558	78558	He	580	" Really ? Because right now my type seems to be working for you . "
78782	78785	78773	78773	he	580	" No , "
78793	78805	78786	78786	I	970	" Wait , I did n't . . . Jack . . ."He
78816	78822	78823	78823	I	970	"I was n't finished yet , "
78856	78863	78848	78848	he	580	" I was n't , either . ""Then
78869	78900	78902	78902	you	1502	" Privately I excused myself for whining . Any woman would have whined in such circumstances . He reached for a fluffy white towel and began to dry me efficiently . "

78954	78998	79001	79001	you	0	" Throwing the towel aside , he pulled me back to the bedroom . In a matter of seconds , he had tossed me onto the bed as if I weighed nothing . I squeaked in surprise as I bounced on the mattress . "

79028	79038	79039	79039	I	970	" Let 's wait until we have more time . "But
79054	79062	79063	79063	Jack	580	"I ca n't go downstairs like this , "
79066	79069	79070	79070	I	970	"Too bad , "

79088	79092	79070	79070	I	970	" he cajoled , "

79132	79282	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	ER."I chuckled , and Jack pressed his cheek against the soft bounce of my breast . His hot breath rushed against the distended tip . Slowly his mouth opened over the rosy flesh , his tongue circling . Sliding my arms around his neck , I kissed the thick , damp locks of his hair . He lifted his mouth and took the nipple between his fingers , clamping softly while he moved to kiss the other breast , and my hips pressed upward into his weight . In a matter of seconds I was steaming . He browsed over me as if I were some lavish buffet , nibbling and licking and kissing , lifting and turning me to make certain there was nothing he had missed . I lay on my stomach , gripping fistfuls of amber quilt as he took my hips and hoisted them upward . "This
79285	79291	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	" I heard him whisper . "
79294	79298	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	" I panted . "
79303	79642	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	"His electrifying weight lowered over me from behind , and he nudged my stiff limbs apart . I groaned at the heavy penetration as he glided easily into the wetness . His hand slid beneath me , fingers going to the exact place I needed them . Caught deliciously between his body and his hand , I pushed upward invitingly , and he went as deep as I could take him . His mouth went to my back , kissing the top of my spine . He waited until I pushed up again before he thrust . I realized he was letting me set the rhythm , his every motion a counterpoint to mine . I arched and gasped as I took him , worked him , feeling him shove deeper while those gentle fingers tantalized and teased . Sensations flowed together until I could no longer recognize their separate sources . I gripped his thick muscled wrists , one braced near my head , the other down between my thighs , and I held him there as I went over the edge . The climax was lush and brimming , and each time I thought it had died down , it gave another voluptuous kick . I felt Jack shudder , the heat of him flooding me in violent pulses . When he finally caught his breath , he muttered a few curses . I had to bury a shaky laugh in the covers , because I understood . It felt as if , somehow , a thing that was entirely ordinary had been reinvented , and the two of us along with it . WE DRESSED CLUMSILY AND WENT DOWN TO MY APART - ment , and Jack overpaid the babysitter , who pretended not to notice how disheveled we were . After checking on Luke , who was down for the count , I told Jack that he was welcome to spend the night with me , except the baby would probably wake him up . "No
79645	79654	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	" Jack replied , kicking off his shoes . "
79664	79687	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	" He stripped off his jeans and T - shirt , climbed into bed , and watched me change into my pajamas . "
79694	79737	79688	79688	You	1504	" he said . I smiled at the sight of him leaning back against the brass headboard with his hands clasped comfortably behind his head . He was brawny and tan , incongruously masculine against all the frilly antique fabric and lace . "I
79745	79750	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	" I told him . "Why
79760	79766	79131	79132	the ER."I	251	""I like to be prepared . ""For

79793	79810	79789	79789	He	1504	" Think of it this way — going to bed naked is better for the environment . ""Oh

79886	79902	79903	79903	I	970	" I 'm guessing your usual female company does n't wear boxer shorts to bed , "
79906	79908	79909	79909	Jack	580	"Nope . "
79917	79934	79909	79909	Jack	580	" If they wear anything , it 's usually some kind of see - through nightgown . ""That
79939	79951	79909	79909	Jack	580	" I yawned , relaxing into the warmth of his body . "

79980	79990	79974	79974	His	580	" I 'm kind of partial to these penguins . "My

80357	80370	80352	80352	I	970	" This was the nicest thing you could have done for me . "
80379	80398	80352	80352	I	970	" I am chronically sleep - deprived . I ca n't tell you how good last night was . ""The
80402	80405	80352	80352	I	970	sex?"I grinned . "
80420	80430	80352	80352	I	970	""What about getting your mom to help with baby - sitting?"I
80437	80505	80352	80352	I	970	" She could probably be talked into it , especially if it 's on the right day and it 's not interfering with something else . But the amount of gratitude you have to shower on Mom for something like that is exhausting . I mean , you owe her forever . And the other thing is . . . I do n't trust her with Luke . "Jack
80515	80521	80509	80509	I	970	" You think she 'd hurt him?""Oh
80602	80617	80620	80621	my boy	2045	" I set my mug on the coffee table and reached for the baby . "
80623	80642	80620	80621	my boy	2045	" I murmured , snuggling his warm , wriggly body against my chest . I glanced at Jack . "

80693	80701	80702	80702	I	970	""You want to spend it with me ? "
80706	80717	80718	80718	Jack	580	"I'd like to take you and Luke to Lake Conroe , "
80721	80743	80718	80718	Jack	580	" I keep a boat there . I 'll call ahead to the marina and they 'll pack lunch for us . ""Would

81025	81123	81127	81127	him	580	" I felt cheerful , alight with a sense of impatient happiness I had never felt before . I actually found it difficult to stay still in my car seat — I was tempted to wriggle like a child on the last day of school with five minutes to go before summer began . For the first time in my life , there was no other place I would rather have been and no one else I wanted to be with . I twisted around to look at Luke 's car seat , which was facing backward . "I
81129	81140	81127	81127	him	580	" I said , reaching to unbuckle my seat belt . "He

81407	81433	81401	81401	I	970	" I stopped and flushed . Jack glanced at me quickly , his eyes hidden behind the dark lenses . His voice was very gentle . "

81612	81617	81618	81618	I	970	""He 's a baby , "
81622	81649	81618	81618	I	970	" He has to hear it from someone . How would you like to come into the world and not have anyone say they loved you ? "
81650	81667	81668	81668	you	1533	" My parents never said it . They thought you should n't wear out the words . ""But
81671	81702	81618	81618	I	970	agree?""No . If the feeling is there , you might as well admit it . Saying the words , or not saying them , does n't change a damn thing . "It

81762	81767	81746	81746	men	487	" Kiss my Bass . "
81918	81926	81927	81927	Jack	580	" What about the infant life vest ? "
82042	82045	82046	82046	I	970	TV."My God , "
82051	82084	82046	82046	I	970	" When you said there was an indoor cabin , I thought you meant a room with a couple of chairs and some vinyl windows . This is a yacht , Jack . ""More
82100	82124	82087	82087	they	1548	""That 's ridiculous . You can have pocket change or a pocket watch . You ca n't put a yacht in your pocket . ""We’ll
82133	82137	82087	82087	they	1548	" Jack said . "
82151	82428	82143	82143	Luke	2045	"AT CRUISING SPEED THE RIDE WAS QUIET AND SMOOTH , the hull of the Last Fling cutting decisively through the dark blue water . I sat on the flybridge , one of the boat 's two helms , on a wide cushioned bench seat next to the skipper 's chair . Luke was bundled in a blue nylon life jacket with a huge rounded notation collar . Either it was more comfortable than it looked , or the baby was distracted by the new sounds and sensations of being on a boat , because he was surprisingly unfussy . Holding the baby on my lap , I put my legs up on the bench . As Jack took us around the lake , pointing out homes , mini islands , a bald eagle hunting for catfish , I sipped from a glass of chilled white wine that tasted like pears . I was overtaken by the kind of ease that could only come from being in a boat in sunny weather , the air humid and beneficent in my lungs , the warm breeze rushing continuously over us . We anchored in a cove shaded by abundant pine and cedar , the shoreline still undeveloped . I unpacked an enormous picnic basket , discovering a jar of creamed honey , crisp pale baguettes , disks of snowy - white goat cheese and a wedge of Humboldt with a thin line of volcanic ash , containers of salad , sections of gourmet sandwiches , and cookies the size of hubcaps . We ate slowly and finished the bottle of wine , and I fed and changed Luke . "He
82435	82492	82496	82496	Luke	2045	" I said , cuddling the sleepy baby . We took him inside the air - conditioned cabin to one of the downstairs staterooms . I laid him carefully in the center of the double berth . Luke blinked at me , his eyes staying closed longer each time , until finally he was fast asleep . "
82498	82542	82496	82496	Luke	2045	" I whispered , kissing his head . Straightening , I stretched my back and glanced at Jack , who was waiting near the doorway . He had propped his shoulders against the wall , and stood with his hands in his pockets . "Come
82545	82591	82496	82496	Luke	2045	" he murmured . The sound of his voice in the darkness sent a pleasant shiver across my skin . He took me to the other stateroom , cool and shadowy , and scented of polished wood and ozone and the slightest hint of diesel . "I
82596	82610	82496	82496	Luke	2045	" I asked , slipping off my shoes and crawling onto the bed . "You
82619	82722	82496	82496	Luke	2045	"We lay on our sides facing each other , skin releasing heat , retaining the flavor of salt as our perspiration dried . Jack stared at me steadily . His hand lifted to the side of my face , the tip of his middle finger following the wing of a brow , the soft ridge of a cheekbone . He touched me with absolute absorption , like an explorer who had discovered a rare and fragile artifact . Remembering the devilish patience of those hands , all the intimate ways he had touched me last night , I flushed in the semidarkness . "
82727	83132	82723	82723	I	970	" I whispered . All my senses turned acute as Jack slowly undressed me . He covered the erect tip of my breast with his mouth , his tongue a soothing swirl . His hand moved to the small of my back , finding the sensitive hollows of my spine , caressing until I was filled with hot sparks . Jack took off his own clothes , his body sleek and unbelievably strong . He arranged me in revealing positions , each one more open and vulnerable than the last , exploring with his hands and mouth until I was breathing in ragged gasps . Pinning my wrists to the mattress , he stared down at me . I moaned and tilted my hips upward , waiting tensely , my arms straining in his grasp . I gasped as I felt the low , heavy penetration , his body sliding over mine until I was stroked inside and out . Hard flesh over pale curves , heat against coolness . Every thrust translated skin into sensation , form into fire . Jack held still , panting , trying to stave off the climax , make it last . Letting go of my wrists , he laced all of his fingers through all of mine with painstaking deliberation . I lifted up against him , wanting to go on , and he inhaled sharply , trying to hold back . But I kept nudging upward , pushing him , until finally he lost all restraint and began to thrust deep and steady , taking my sobs into his mouth as if he could taste them . Since I could n't hold him with my arms , I used my legs , twining them around his back . He gritted his teeth and buried himself over and over , stoking the sensation , driving me into long , silky spasms , and then he let himself come , too , growling his pleasure against my throat . Afterward we lay together , limbs tangled , my head resting on his shoulder . How strange it was to lie there with a man who was n't Dane . Stranger still was that it felt so natural . I thought of what Dane had told me , that although he did n't want a traditional relationship , it was okay if I wanted to explore that with Jack . "Jack
83134	83139	82723	82723	I	970	" I said drowsily . "What
83141	83150	82723	82723	I	970	" His hand sifted slowly through my hair . "
83156	83177	82723	82723	I	970	relationship?""As opposed to what you had with Dane ? Yeah , I 'd say that 's what we 're having . ""So
83192	83197	83189	83192	the two of us?"Jack	1551	us?"Jack hesitated before replying . "
83204	83209	83201	83201	I	970	" he finally said . "
83212	83224	83226	83226	your	1552	you?""It makes me uneasy that we 're doing this so fast . ""What
83229	83241	83226	83226	your	1552	you?""My gut and I are n't currently speaking to each other . "He
83244	83262	83263	83263	Jack	580	" Mine 's almost always right . And it 's telling me this is a good thing . "
83276	83303	83263	83263	Jack	580	" Let 's try it with just you and me . No other people , no distractions . Let 's find out what that 's like . Okay?""Okay
83305	83309	83263	83263	Jack	580	" I yawned . "
83333	83337	83338	83338	he	580	""Go to sleep , "
83359	83365	83367	83367	you	1552	" Yes , but did you hear—""I
83369	83428	83367	83367	you	1552	" And he held me as I slept . MY RELAXED MOOD WAS SHATTERED AS SOON AS WE got back to 1800 Main , and I listened to the messages on the answering machine . Tara had called three times , sounding increasingly agitated as she told me to call her back no matter what time it was . "It
83437	83457	83434	83435	Mark Gottler	535	" I told Jack glumly as he set down Luke 's carrier and lifted the baby to his shoulder . "
83479	83487	83472	83472	he	535	""Did you tell her that we 'd seen him?""No
83535	83543	83544	83544	Jack	580	""Call her right now and find out , "
83555	83569	83544	83544	Jack	580	"Does Luke have a dirty diaper ? I 'll take care of it . ""Call
83595	83613	83588	83588	I	970	"I gave him a grateful glance and called Tara . Tara picked up on the second ring . "
83614	83628	83570	83571	your sister	526	Hello?""Tara , it 's me . I just got your message . How is everything?"Her
83635	83652	83570	83571	your sister	526	" Everything was great until Mark called and told me what you 'd been up to . "I
83658	83668	83570	83571	your sister	526	" I 'm sorry he bothered you with that . ""You
83715	83727	83710	83711	Jack Travis	580	business?""He 's a friend . He was there for moral support . ""It
83804	83828	83829	83829	I	970	"I was silent , trying to regulate my breathing . Tara , when she was angry , sounded too much like our mother . "
83837	83842	83843	83843	I	970	" I eventually said . "
83875	83892	83896	83896	her	1557	""Mark 's already promised to help me . There was no need for you to get lawyers involved!"I
83899	83918	83920	83920	her	1557	" How much stock are you going to put in the promises of a man who cheats on his wife?"I
83925	83958	83920	83920	her	1557	" It 's not your business . This is my life . I do n't want you to talk to Mark ever again . You do n't understand the situation at all . ""I
83967	83972	83977	83977	Tara	364	" I said grimly . "
83998	84039	84040	84040	I	970	for?""No , and I do n't want to hear it . I know what he 's promised me , and that 's enough . Any contract you give me , I 'm going tear it up and throw it away . ""Can
84051	84092	84040	84040	I	970	about?""No . I 'm not interested in anything you have to say . I 'm finally getting what I want , for once in my life , and you 're judging and interfering and spoiling everything . Just like Mom . "I
84095	84102	84040	84040	I	970	" I 'm not like Mom . ""You
84132	84149	84153	84153	Tara	364	"Right then I discovered that you actually could see red , if you were angry enough . "
84155	84181	84182	84182	Jack	580	" I snapped . Click . Silence . I looked at the dead phone in my hand . I dropped my head in utter defeat . "
84184	84202	84182	84182	Jack	580	""Yeah?""I just told my sister — who 's in a mental health clinic — to grow up . "He
84220	84224	84213	84213	His	321	" I heard . "I
84231	84246	84213	84213	His	321	" Do you have Mark Gottler 's number ? I have to call him . ""Got
84261	84267	84255	84255	You	1561	" Jack studied me briefly . "
84278	84282	84255	84255	You	1561	" he murmured . "
84288	84364	84366	84366	Mark	535	you?"I considered the offer , knowing that even though I could handle Gottler on my own , this was precisely the sort of thing Jack was good at . And right now it was nice to have the help . I nodded . He handed Luke to me , went to the table where he had left his wallet , keys , and phone . In about two minutes he had Gottler on the phone . "Hey
84462	84468	84450	84450	I	970	" He paused to listen . "
84478	84486	84476	84476	Mark	535	" His tone was quiet but blistering . "
84565	84572	84553	84553	you	1566	" Jack listened for a moment . "
84800	84835	84837	84837	Jack	580	" He listened for a half minute or so , looked satisfied and said goodbye , and closed the phone with a decisive snap . Looking at me , he raised an expectant brow . "Thanks
84839	84852	84855	84855	he	580	" I said softly , the tight feeling easing from my chest . "
84858	84863	84855	84855	he	580	attention?""He was paying attention . "
84885	84891	84892	84892	he	580	" It 'll be fine , "
84895	84906	84892	84892	he	580	" You do n't waste one minute worrying about it . ""All
84909	84930	84943	84943	you	580	" I reached out and stroked the dark layers of his hair . I felt oddly bashful as I asked , "
84944	84946	84943	84943	you	580	rather—""Yes . "A
84954	84962	84943	84943	you	580	" You want some time to think about it?""Okay
84964	84983	84943	84943	you	580	" He squinted thoughtfully as if mulling it over , and a split second later , he said , "
84986	85092	85093	85093	He	1578	" EIGHTEENDURING THE NEXT MONTH WE SPENT EVERY NIGHT together , and all the weekends , and still it seemed that I could never see Jack enough . There were moments when I hardly recognized myself , laughing and playing like the child I had never been . We went to a roadhouse honky - tonk , where Jack led me onto the wooden dance floor , sticky with the residue of beer and tequila , and taught me how to two - step . Another day we went to an indoor butterfly garden and let hundreds of colorful wings flutter around us like confetti . "
85100	85764	85093	85093	He	1578	" Jack whispered in my ear as one of the butterflies perched on my shoulder . He took Luke and me to an arts and flowers market , where he bought me a huge basket of handmade soaps and two pails of melting - ripe Fredericksburg peaches . We dropped off one of the pails at his father 's home and visited for about an hour , going out to the back with him to view a putting green that had just been installed . Discovering that I had never played golf , Churchill gave me an impromptu putting lesson . I told him I did n't need to take on a new hobby that I was bad at , and Churchill told me that golf was one of the two things in life you could enjoy even if you were bad at them . Before I could ask what the other thing was , Jack shook his head with a groan and dragged me out of there , but not before his father had made him promise to bring me back soon . There were elegant occasions when Jack and I attended a charity event for the Houston Symphony , or went to the opening of an art gallery , or out to dinner at a luminous restaurant located in a renovated 1920s church . I was amused and also annoyed by the reactions of other women to Jack , the way they fluttered and flirted . He was courteous but distant , but that only seemed to encourage them . And I realized Jack was not the only one with a possessive streak . I relished the weekend afternoons when I hired a babysitter to look after Luke , and I went up to Jack 's apartment . We lay together for hours , talking or having sex , sometimes at the same time . As a lover , Jack was inventive and skillful , guiding me into new levels of sensuality , easing me back carefully . Day by day I felt myself changing in ways that I could n't bring myself to examine . We were getting too close , I knew that , but I could n't think of how to stop it . I found myself telling Jack everything about my past , things I had previously confided only to Dane , memories still painful enough to make my eyes water and my voice crack . Instead of saying something philosophical or wise , Jack simply hugged me , offering the comfort of his body . It was what I needed most . But I often felt the tension of conflicting desires when I was with Jack . I was so powerfully drawn to him , and yet also trying hard to maintain any fragile barriers I could . And he was so damnably smart , too smart to push me . Instead , he seduced me constantly , with gentleness and strength , with sex and charm and steely patience . * * * ONE DAY JACK BROUGHT LUKE AND ME TO GAGE AND Liberty 's home in the Tanglewood subdivision , for an afternoon of swimming and relaxation . He explained that he would have to spend part of the time helping his brother Gage work on a twelve - foot salt bay skiff they were building in the garage . It had started as a project for Liberty 's eleven - year - old sister , Carrington , whom Liberty had raised since birth . Gage was helping her to make the small boat , but they needed an extra pair of hands to get the job done . Tanglewood was in the Galleria area , the residential lots generally smaller than River Oaks , the main boulevard lined with live oaks and wide paths and benches . Gage and Liberty had bought a tear - down property , one of the last few crumbling "
85767	85916	85918	85918	your	1580	" homes built in the fifties , and they had built a European - style mansion of limestone and stucco , with a black slate roof . The entrance featured a two - story rotunda and a curving staircase with a wrought - iron balustrade , and more ironwork at the circular balcony of the second - floor level . Everything was serene , agreeably textured and roughened , as though it was a centuries - old home . Liberty welcomed us at the door , her hair pulled back in a pony - tail , her slim but curvaceous figure dressed in a neat black swimsuit and a pair of frayed denim shorts . She wore flip - flops decorated with sequined fake flowers . Liberty had an interesting quality I could only describe as wholesome sultriness , a sort of clear - eyed , sexy niceness . "I
85921	85937	85938	85939	My sister	2036	" I said . Liberty hugged me as if I were an old family friend . "
85956	85968	85971	85971	stranger	1584	" She stood on her toes to kiss Jack 's cheek . "
85982	85994	85973	85973	We	1585	"He grinned at Liberty while he held Luke against his shoulder . "
85998	86012	86013	86013	She	2036	""Well , that 's good . Anything that keeps you out of trouble . "
86023	86040	86013	86013	She	2036	" You forget how little they are at the beginning . He 's adorable , Ella . ""Thanks
86042	86102	86013	86013	She	2036	" I felt a glow of pride , as if Luke were my own child instead of Tara's . Two new figures entered the hall — Liberty 's tall , black - haired husband , Gage , and a young blond girl . Carrington looked nothing like Liberty , which led me to conclude they were half - sisters . "Jack
86104	86119	86120	86122	My favorite uncle	1587	" she exclaimed , hurtling toward him , all skinny legs and flying braids . "
86124	86134	86135	86135	Jack	580	""I already said I 'd help with the boat , "
86143	86176	86135	86135	Jack	580	"It 's fun , Jack ! Gage banged his finger and said a bad word , and let me use the cordless drill , and I got to hammer nails into the side boards—""Cordless
86179	86197	86135	86135	Jack	580	" Liberty repeated , darting a half - worried , half - chiding glance at her husband . "She
86201	86212	86215	86215	Ella	0	" Gage smiled and reached out to shake my hand . "
86227	86236	86237	86237	Jack	580	""Don't believe anything he tells you , Ella , "
86240	86250	86237	86237	Jack	580	" I am and always have been an angel . "Gage
86263	86268	86253	86253	Liberty	248	" Which finger did you hurt?""It
86272	86336	86337	86337	Carrington	256	" Gage showed her his thumb , and she frowned as she inspected the place on the nail that had begun to bruise . I was struck by the way his expression changed as he looked at his wife 's down - bent head , the way his eyes softened . Retaining his hand in hers , Liberty glanced at her little sister . "
86344	86396	86398	86398	Ella	0	"The girl shook my hand and smiled at me , revealing two crooked front teeth . She had porcelain skin and sky blue eyes , and a barely discernable tracery of pink lines on the bridge of her nose and her forehead , as if she 'd been wearing a mask . "Call
86402	86410	86411	86411	She	0	" I glanced at Liberty and added , "
86421	86426	86411	86411	She	0	""How did you know ? "
86445	86474	86439	86439	she	0	" Oh , he 's so cute ! Can I hold him ? I 'm really good at holding babies . I help with Matthew all the time . ""Maybe

86506	86514	86515	86515	She	0	""Okay , it 's in the garage ! "
86533	86542	86523	86523	Jack	580	" You okay hanging out with Liberty by the pool?""There
86550	86578	86523	86523	Jack	580	"Liberty took me through the house and out to the back . She carried Luke , cooing to him , while I followed with the diaper bag . "
86583	86587	86581	86581	Matthew	200	" I asked . "He
86609	86708	86598	86599	The babysitter	2695	"We went through a kitchen that looked like something out of a rustic French chateau . A pair of French doors led to a fenced - in backyard , which was landscaped with a green lawn , flower beds , and a party deck with a grill . The dominant feature of the half - acre yard was a stone - and - tile pool made of two connecting lagoons , one shallow and one deep . The end of the shallow lagoon ended in a sandy white shore with a real palm tree growing in the center . "
86712	86723	86598	86599	The babysitter	2695	" Liberty said , laughing as she noticed my interest . "
86757	86766	86742	86742	Gage	98	""You mean it was shipped all the way from Hawaii?""Yes
86824	86860	86817	86817	I	970	""Misters?"Liberty went to flip a switch near the barbecue pavilion , activating nozzles that had been recessed in the deck to create a light cooling mist around the pool . I was very nearly awed . "
86865	86869	86817	86817	I	970	" I said . "
86886	86889	86890	86890	She	1596	""I know . "
86895	86907	86890	86890	She	1596	" Believe me , this is n't how I grew up . "We
86935	86941	86942	86942	I	970	"How did you meet Gage ? "
86967	86992	86960	86960	I	970	"Churchill got his hair cut at the salon where I worked , and we became friends . I was his manicurist for a while . "

I think it 's been hard for him to find a woman who could look beyond the money and the Travis name , and want him for who he is .

87767	87811	87812	87812	Her	247	"Ashley is good with men . She knows all the football stats , and she hunts and fishes , and she cusses and tells filthy jokes , and on top of all that she looks like a Chanel model . Men love her . "

87902	87914	87915	87915	I	970	" I have a lot of reasons for being this way . "
87922	87953	87915	87915	I	970	" And I 'm sorry if I sound defensive , but telling a married person you never want to get married is like waving a red flag at a bull . "Instead

88180	88200	88119	88119	him	580	" I asked him , and he gazed back at me as if similarly mystified . Liberty laughed gently . "

88258	88369	88370	88370	I	970	" Liberty seemed genuinely puzzled . Because I lose everyone I care about , sooner or later . I could n't say that aloud — although it had a potent inner logic for me , I knew it would make me sound crazy . There was no way to explain that the very thing I craved , the intensity of a relationship with Jack , was what I feared most . It was n't a rational fear , of course . . . it was purely visceral , which made it that much harder to fight against . I shrugged and made my lips in the shape of a smile . "

89644	89704	89629	89630	Uncle Jack	263	" At the sound of her titter , Jack paused in his sawing , followed her gaze and saw me standing there . A slow smile spread across his face , and his gaze turned dark and hot as he glanced over my pink swimsuit and bare legs . Dropping the saw , he muttered to the other two , "
89720	89726	89727	89727	I	970	""No , you do n't , "
89730	89753	89727	89727	I	970	" I just wanted a peek at the skiff . It 's beautiful , Carrington . What color are you going to paint it?""Pink

His lips were warm as they moved over mine , the kiss erotic in its careful lightness . * * * AFTER THE BOAT - BUILDERS HAD FINISHED GLUING and nailing the gunnels in place , they cooled off in the pool , and we spent the rest of the afternoon lazing and swimming . Lunch was brought out , big bowls of field greens tossed with grilled chicken , red grapes , and walnuts , and we shared a bottle of ice - cold white burgundy in chilled glasses . The nanny took the children inside the cool house , while Gage , Liberty , Jack , and I ate at a table shaded by a huge umbrella . "I'm

For all that they were a friendly and gregarious couple , they were both protective of their private life . The feelings cut too deep for them to be put on display . We all drank to the newlyweds and talked for a few minutes about Playa del Carmen , which apparently was known for its beaches and fine fishing , and was far less touristy than Cancun . "Have

He loved it nearly as much as I loved watching him . At two months , he laughed , smiled , made noises , and was able to raise his head and chest . Jack lay on the floor beside him , lazily reaching up to flick the toys or to push a button for new music . "

92285	92303	92304	92304	I	970	"No . It 's a shallow , meaningless , purely physical relationship that 's heading absolutely nowhere . "
92317	92347	92307	92307	Jack	580	"Cool ! Ella , do you think you could get him to fix me up with one of his friends ? I 've been having kind of a dry spell lately—""I've

93622	93994	93618	93618	You	1723	"Whenever my mother was around , reality took on the dimensions of a fun - house mirror . Insanity was simply a result of being a frequent Starbucks customer , size eight was a stage of obesity that required medical intervention , and any man I dated was clearly having to make do with a second - rate substitute for Candy Varner . And anything I had ever done or said could be conveniently rewritten to suit whatever spin she had chosen . For the next forty - five minutes , it was the Candy Varner Show with no commercial interruptions . She told Jack that she would have offered to take care of Luke , but she was just too busy , and she 'd already done her duty , working and sacrificing all those years for her daughters , neither of whom were appropriately grateful and were both more than a little jealous . And imagine Ella giving advice to people for a living , when Ella hardly knew what she was talking about — you had to do a lot more living than Ella had before you knew who was who and what was what . Whatever Ella knew about life , it had come from her mother 's imparted wisdom . Mom proceeded to present herself as the desirable original , the brand name , with me as a failed copy . She tried to do some heavy - handed flirting with Jack . He was polite and respectful , occasionally glancing at my stony expression . When Mom started to name - drop , pretending she knew some of the same rich people Jack did , it was so mortifying that I felt myself shutting down . I stopped protesting or correcting , just occupied myself with Luke , checking his diaper , putting him back into the baby gym , and playing with him . My ears felt hot , the rest of me ice - cold . And then I registered that , like clockwork , she had shifted the conversation to the inappropriately personal , revealing that she 'd recently signed on for laser hair - removal treatments from an exclusive Houston spa .

94000	94010	93995	93995	I	970	" she was telling Jack with a girlish giggle , "

94202	94355	94357	94357	Mom	2035	"I stood while my mother came to embrace me . The perfumed smell of her , the warm proximity of her , made me want to cry like a child . I wondered why I would always long for her to love me in a way she was n't capable of , why Tara and I were nothing more to her than collateral damage from a marriage that had gone bad . I had learned that there were substitutes for a mother who could n't be a mother . You could find love with other people . You could find it in places you were n't even looking . But the original wound would never heal . I would carry it with me forever , and so would Tara . That was the trick . . . accepting it , going on with your life , knowing it was part of you . "Bye
94359	94364	94357	94357	Mom	2035	" I said thickly . "Don't

94514	94590	94593	94593	you	1731	"By the time Jack had returned , I had downed a shot of tequila from the pantry , hoping the liquor would burn through my head - to - toe numbness . It had n't . I felt like a freezer that needed to be defrosted . Luke fretted in my arms , making impatient noises , wriggling . Jack came to me and touched my chin , forcing me to meet his searching gaze . "Now
94604	94609	94593	94593	you	1731	" I asked morosely . "No
94621	94634	94611	94611	I	970	""I guess you can tell why Tara and I both needed therapy . ""Hell

94676	94688	94611	94611	I	970	" Did she make a pass at you in the elevator ? "
94689	94692	94693	94693	he	970	" Nope , "

94739	94746	94747	94747	I	970	"Not the regular kind of angry , "
94751	94796	94747	94747	I	970	" It 's the kind that makes you tired and cold all the way through and you ca n't feel anything . Not even your own heartbeat . I want to call Tara and download on her , because I think she 'd understand . ""Why

We went up to his apartment , and Jack took me straight to the bedroom . He turned on a lamp , and went into the bathroom , and I heard the sounds of water and steam . "
95008	95012	95001	95001	I	970	" I said . "Get

95337	95430	95431	95431	I	970	" He worked down my back , his hands gliding , sweeping in long strokes , then kneading in deeper , shorter strokes , coaxing out tension , easing the knotted muscles . I gave myself over entirely to those strong , deliberate hands , my body lost and flung and heavy . He worked on my bottom , thighs , calves , and turned me over and pulled my feet into his lap . I made a little sound of pleasure as I felt him run his thumbs along my arches . "Sorry
95435	95441	95431	95431	I	970	" I managed to say . "You

96998	97047	97048	97048	I	970	" I said , and took him to the sofa . But after about two minutes of classical music and dancing puppets , I was too impatient to sit . I was concerned for Jack . If he was confronting a problem , I wanted to be there . "
97054	97059	97048	97048	I	970	" I told Luke . "
97071	97160	97048	97048	I	970	"Slinging the diaper bag over my shoulder , I carried the baby out of the apartment , and we headed to the elevator . When we reached Jack 's door , I pushed the doorbell . The door opened promptly . Jack blocked me for a few seconds , his body conveying the tension of a man who badly wished he were somewhere else . I had never seen him look so upset . Beyond his shoulder , I saw the movement of someone else in the room . "Jack
97162	97166	97048	97048	I	970	" I murmured . "
97169	97188	97048	97048	I	970	okay?"Jack blinked , touched his tongue to his lips , started to say something , and stopped himself . "Someone
97192	97399	97048	97048	I	970	" I suggested , trying to glance around him . Jack nodded emphatically , with a flash of desperation in his eyes . I pushed past him and stopped as I saw Ashley Everson . She was a gorgeous mess , her eyes smoked with heavy dark liner , cheeks slicked with tears , her slender fingers knotted around a wad of tissues . The pale , stick - straight locks of her hair needed a good brushing . I was struck by the contrast between her woeful little - girl expression and her stylish outfit , a short white skirt , a slim - fitting black top that conformed perfectly to her uplifted breasts , a neat little cropped jacket , and strappy sandals with four - inch heels . Photographed just this way , smudgy makeup included , she would have made the perfect perfume ad , a sexy waif . I did n't think for one second that Jack had invited her there , or that he still wanted her . But I could n't decide if this were a situation best left for him to handle alone , or if he needed backup . I glanced at Jack with a quick grimace . "

97493	97516	97517	97517	She	1772	"She ignored my outstretched hand , glanced over my T - shirt and jeans , and spoke to Jack with patent bewilderment . "

97902	97923	97899	97899	I	970	" Just that you and your husband have hit a rough patch . It 's not an abusive relationship , is it?""No
97925	97931	97932	97932	We	1775	" came her frosty reply . "

98232	98338	98228	98228	I	970	" All I know is that getting back together with Jack wo n't fix you or your problems . What you had with him is in the past . Jack 's gone on with his life . And I 'm going to take the liberty of speaking for him by saying that I 'm sure he still cares about you as a human being , but nothing more than that . So now , the best thing you can do for Jack , and yourself , and everyone , is to go home to Pete and ask him what you can do about your marriage . "

98466	98522	98464	98464	Ashley	247	" I said , reaching out to touch her skinny arm . She shook me off . I saw that she was angry but in control , her face taut , her forehead puckered as if it had been embroidered too tightly . Her gaze arrowed to Jack , who had come up behind me . "
98530	98535	98464	98464	Ashley	247	" she told him , "

98588	98619	98583	98583	she	247	" He 'll put lots of mileage on you , honey . He 'll take you on a fast ride , and then you 'll get dumped by the roadside . "
98626	98670	98620	98620	Her	247	" You have n't changed at all . You think going out with someone like her will make everyone think you 're all mature now , but the truth is , you 're still the same selfish , shallow asshole you always were . "

Maybe he meant too much to her . . . maybe she could n't bring herself to discuss the source of such powerful longing . I wandered to Luke 's crib , where he was sleeping . I reached out to touch one of the honeypots on the mobile . My fingers were trembling . "

JACK AND I ARGUED OVER THE PROSPECT OF TARA 'S return , because he wanted to be there , and I wanted to face it alone . I did n't want him to be a part of something so painful and personal . I had a pretty good idea of how much giving up Luke was going to hurt , and I would rather not have Jack see me at a moment of such weakness . Besides , that Friday was Joe 's birthday , and they had planned to go fishing on an overnight trip to Galveston . "You

Not a lot of anger ; just a small , potent kindling , enough to burn out any remaining hint of optimism about my own future . Had Tara never asked me to do this , I would be unaware of this level of pain . And if I ever had to go through this again , someone was going to have to put me in a dirt - filled pot and start watering me three times a week . A knock at the door , three soft raps . Carrying Luke , I went to answer it . And there was Tara , more beautiful than I remembered , with a few hard edges that did n't detract from her looks at all . She was slender , beautifully dressed in a white hammered - silk top and skinny black pants , and black flats with silver studs . Her white - blond hair fell loose in casual waves , and oversized hoops hung from her ears . And her wrist glittered with what had to be a fifteen - carat tennis bracelet . Tara came into the apartment with a wordless exclamation , not trying to take Luke from me , just putting her long arms around us both . I had forgotten how much taller than me she was . I remembered the time in our teens when I realized she had shot up past me in height , and I had complained that she should n't have gotten a growth spurt before I had . And she 'd teased me by saying she 'd gotten both our growth spurts . The embrace reminded me of a thousand memories . It reminded me how much I loved her . She drew back to look at me , and her gaze fell to the baby . "

She did n't want to answer me . Her evasiveness was maddening . Sensitive to the tension between us , or perhaps tiring of the unfamiliar arms , Luke began to writhe and fret . "

103552	103633	103550	103550	Luke	2045	" I whispered . And then I stood back and watched my sister carry Luke away . She took him onto the elevator , and the doors opened and closed , and they were gone . Moving like an old woman , I went back into the apartment . I could n't seem to think of what to do . Mechanically I wandered into the kitchen and began to make tea that I knew I was n't going to drink . "It
103637	103642	103550	103550	Luke	2045	" I said aloud . "
103647	103950	103550	103550	Luke	2045	"Luke would wake up and I would n't be there . He would wonder why I had left him . The sound of my voice would fade from his memory . My boy . My baby . I accidentally scalded my fingers with the hot water , but the pain did n't really register . Some part of my mind worried over how badly I was dissociating . I wanted Jack . . . he might know how to break through the layers of ice around me . . . but at the same time , the thought of being with him filled me with dread . I changed into my pajamas , and for the rest of the afternoon I watched TV without seeing or hearing anything . The phone rang , and the answering machine picked up . Before I glanced at the caller ID , I knew it was Jack . There was no way I could talk to him , or anyone , at the moment . I turned the volume down completely . Recognizing that I needed to go through the motions of a normal routine , I made soup with powdered chicken broth and consumed it slowly , and followed it with a glass of wine . The phone rang again , and again , and I let the answering machine take it each time , until a half - dozen messages had been left . Just as I considered going to bed , there was a knock at the door . It was Haven . Her dark brown eyes , so like her brother 's , were filled with concern . She made no attempt to come inside , just slipped her hands in the pockets of her jeans and regarded me with infinite patience . "

104169	104215	104158	104158	I	970	" Ella . I 've never had a baby , and I do n't know exactly what you 're going through . . . but I do know about loss . And grief . And I 'm a good listener . Let 's talk tomorrow , okay?""There
104222	104252	104253	104253	Jack	580	" I had no intention of talking about Luke ever again . It was a closed chapter in my life . She reached out and touched my shoulder lightly . "
104261	104265	104253	104253	Jack	580	" she said . "
104270	104277	104253	104253	Jack	580	""I probably wo n't be here , "
104284	104292	104253	104253	Jack	580	" I 'm going back to Austin . "She
104298	104301	104253	104253	Jack	580	" For a visit?""I
104328	104360	104316	104316	I	970	" I had been safe in Austin , with Dane . I had not felt too much , given too much , needed too much . There had been no promises . "Do
104367	104372	104361	104361	you	1855	" Haven asked softly . "I
104377	104381	104361	104361	you	1855	" I said . "
104396	104401	104402	104402	Haven	819	""Wait before deciding anything , "
104405	104423	104402	104402	Haven	819	" You need time . Give it some time , and you 'll know what to do . "
104779	104782	104783	104783	I	970	" Hi , "
104795	104838	104783	104783	I	970	" I 'm sorry I did n't answer last night . I was tired , and . . . well , anyway , I saw the weather report , and I want to make sure you 're okay . Please call me . "There
104897	104898	104882	104882	I	970	" Jack?""Ella

104999	105029	105030	105030	I	970	""I noticed that . I tried to call Jack earlier because of the weather report , but he did n't pick up . I thought he was probably busy . "
105033	105037	105030	105030	I	970	" Should we be worried?""Not
105058	105071	105046	105046	I	970	"I'll go up to his apartment and look for the float plan . ""No
105104	105113	105096	105096	They	1865	""Okay . Call and let me know , will you?""Absolutely
105115	105161	105096	105096	They	1865	"Haven hung up , and I stood frowning at the receiver in my hand . I reached up and rubbed the back of my neck , which was prickling . I dialed Jack 's cell phone again , and his voice mail picked up immediately . "
105167	105175	105096	105096	They	1865	" I said , my voice taut . "
105185	105240	105096	105096	They	1865	"After watching the weather channel for a few more minutes , I picked up my purse and left the apartment . It felt weird to go out without all the paraphernalia I usually dragged around because of Luke . I went up to Haven and Hardy 's apartment , and Haven let me in . "I'm

105386	105396	105381	105381	Haven	819	"You may have to get in line for that . "Hardy
105417	105422	105423	105423	he	98	" Hey , Ella , "
105474	105480	105481	105481	Haven	819	"What did the harbormaster say ? "
105491	105520	105484	105484	His	169	" They 're trying to reach them on the VHF radio . Nothing on 9 — that 's the distress channel — and no Maydays have come in . ""Is
105524	105548	105484	105484	His	169	" I asked . Hardy glanced at me with a slight smile , but a pair of notches had settled between his brows . "
105555	105589	105484	105484	His	169	"I knew nothing about boats . I did n't even know what questions to ask . But I was trying desperately to think of an explanation for why Jack and Joe were missing . "
105614	105618	105484	105484	His	169	" Hardy nodded . "
105636	105643	105644	105644	Haven	819	""Jack and Joe are really experienced , "
105647	105671	105672	105672	She	1513	" They know all about safety procedures , and neither of them would take unnecessary chances . I 'm sure they 're okay . "
105687	105698	105672	105672	She	1513	"What if they did n't manage to outrun the weather ? "
105704	105711	105712	105712	she	1513	"It 's not a bad storm , "
105715	105734	105735	105735	She	1513	" And if they got caught in it , they would just batten down and ride it out . "
105742	105757	105735	105735	She	1513	" I 'm going to call Gage and see if anyone 's with Dad . "For
105869	105876	105877	105877	Haven	819	"I wish I was a smoker , "
105892	105906	105909	105909	you	1884	" This is one of those times when chain - smoking seems appropriate . ""Oh
105913	105924	105909	105909	you	1884	" Hardy murmured , reaching out to catch her wrist . "
105934	105954	105955	105955	you	1884	" He drew her between his thighs as he leaned against the sofa , and she nestled against him . "Including
105957	105965	105966	105966	You	1884	" she said , her voice muffled . "
105972	105976	105955	105955	you	1884	""That 's right . "
105991	106000	105977	105977	He	1884	" And there 's no getting over me . "The
106024	106040	106043	106043	he	169	" Cates here . Gage , how 's it going ? They found 'em yet ? "
106080	106084	106085	106085	Hardy	169	" Got it , "
106089	106138	106139	106139	He	169	" Do they need more choppers ? Because if so , I can get as many as . . . I know . But it 's like trying to find two fucking pennies someone dropped in the backyard . I know . Okay , we 'll sit tight . "
106144	106148	106149	106149	Haven	819	"What is it ? "
106185	106192	106193	106193	he	169	" They found a debris field , "
106200	106211	106193	106193	he	169	" And what 's left of the boat is submerged . "My
106234	106243	106244	106244	Haven	819	"So they 're doing a search and rescue ? "
106256	106273	106253	106253	He	169	" The Coast Guard is sending out a couple of Tupperwolfs — those big orange choppers . ""Debris
106276	106286	106253	106253	He	169	" I said dazedly , swallowing against rising nausea . "
106295	106298	106299	106302	One of the rigs	1886	explosion?"He nodded . "
106309	106405	106299	106302	One of the rigs	1886	"All three of us struggled to take in the news . I put my hand up to my mouth , breathing against the screen of my fingers . I wondered where Jack was at that very moment , if he was hurt , if he was drowning . No , do n't think about that . But for a second it felt as if I were drowning , too . I could actually feel the cold black water folding over my head , pushing me down where I could n't breathe or see or hear . "Hardy
106407	106425	106299	106302	One of the rigs	1886	" I said , surprised by how rational I sounded , when there was chaos inside me . "
106434	106439	106299	106302	One of the rigs	1886	explode?"He sounded excessively calm . "
106490	106513	106514	106514	They	1890	" He looked down at Haven 's face . She was flushed , her mouth twisting as she tried not to cry . "
106520	106528	106514	106514	They	1890	" he murmured , pulling her closer . "
106546	106551	106552	106552	Haven	819	""It 's rough water , "
106558	106567	106568	106568	he	1891	"There 's a lot of movement out there , "
106571	106599	106568	106568	he	1891	" According to Gage , the captain who 's coordinating the rescue operation is looking at a computer model to figure out where they might have drifted . ""What
106610	106615	106568	106568	he	1891	" I asked unsteadily . "
106634	106643	106568	106568	he	1891	jacket?"The question was greeted with a frozen silence . "
106647	106652	106568	106568	he	1891	" Hardy said eventually . "
106657	106909	106568	106568	he	1891	"I nodded and sat heavily on a nearby chair , my mind buzzing . You need time , Haven had told me , when I 'd confided my thoughts about going back to Austin . Give it some time , and you 'll know what to do . But now there was no time . There might never be . If I could only have five minutes with Jack . . . I would have given years of my life for the chance to tell him how much he meant to me . How much I wanted him . Loved him . I thought of his dazzling grin , his midnight eyes , the beautiful severity of his face when he was sleeping . The thought of never seeing him again , never feeling the sweetness of his mouth against mine , caused an ache I could hardly bear . How many hours I 'd spent with Jack in silence , resting together , all words restrained by the limits of what my heart would allow . All those chances to be honest with him , and I 'd taken none of them . I loved him , and he might never know . I understood finally that the thing I should have feared most was not loss , but never loving . The price for safety was the regret I felt at this moment . And yet I would have to live with it for the rest of my life . "I
106916	106921	106568	106568	he	1891	" Haven burst out . "
106934	106968	106969	106969	He	1895	office?""If you want to , I 'll take you . But there 's nothing we can do there except get in the way . Gage will let us know the minute something happens . "
106972	106983	106969	106969	He	1895	" Do you want to go wait with your dad and Liberty?"Haven
106987	107006	106969	106969	He	1895	" If I 'm going to go crazy waiting , I may as well do it around them . "We
107047	107057	107058	107058	She	819	" Let me , sweetheart , you 're driving . "
107067	107082	107083	107083	She	819	" Hi , Gage ? What is it ? Have you found out anything ? "
107096	107129	107130	107130	She	819	" Oh my God . I ca n't believe — which one ? They do n't know ? Shit . Ca n't someone — yes , okay , we 'll be there . "
107135	107139	107140	107140	she	819	" Garner Hospital , "
107144	107178	107179	107179	She	819	" They found them , and picked them up , and they 're medevacing both of them straight there . One of them seems to be in good condition , but the other — "
107193	107201	107202	107202	she	819	" Other one 's in bad shape , "
107207	107210	107202	107202	she	819	"Which one ? "
107235	107260	107224	107224	his	169	"Gage does n't know . That 's all he could find out . He 's calling Liberty so she can bring Dad to Garner . "THE
107335	107338	107339	107339	Hardy	169	"Skybridge parking ? "
107382	107393	107394	107394	Haven	819	"No , there 's a valet at the main entrance , "
107402	107413	107394	107394	Haven	819	"Hold on , honey , I have n't stopped yet . "
107434	107450	107451	107451	he	169	" Y'all mind waiting ' til I put the brakes on before you jump out ? "
107718	107722	107723	107723	I	970	" Mr. Travis , "
107727	107739	107723	107723	I	970	" I hope you do n't mind that I 'm here . "Travis
107788	107798	107799	107799	he	169	" ' Course you should be here , Ella , "
107806	107813	107799	107799	he	169	" Jack'll want to see you . "
107944	107950	107951	107951	she	819	" You know , Ella , "
107963	108015	107951	107951	she	819	" even if they both make it , there could be a rough time ahead . We could be talking amputation , or brain damage , or . . . God , I do n't even know . No one would blame you if you decided you could n't handle it . ""I've
108021	108027	108028	108028	I	970	" I said without hesitation . "
108075	108094	108071	108071	he	580	"I had n't meant to distress her , but Haven surprised me by giving a few muffled sobs . "Haven
108096	108102	108103	108103	I	970	" I began in contrition , "
108107	108109	108103	108103	I	970	I—""No . "
108124	108157	108113	108113	she	1925	" I 'm just glad Jack 's found a woman who will stand by him . He 's been with a lot of women who wanted him for superficial reasons , but — "
108172	108195	108197	108197	I	970	" — none of them loved him just for being Jack . And he knew it , and he wanted something more . ""If
108199	108234	108235	108235	God	130	" I began , but through the open doorway , Haven caught sight of movement in the waiting room . A door on the opposite side had opened , and a doctor came in . "Oh
108237	108333	108235	108235	God	130	" Haven muttered , nearly dropping her coffee as she hurried into the room . My stomach dropped . I was paralyzed , the fingers of one hand digging into the door frame as I watched the Travis family gather around the doctor . I watched his face , and their faces , trying to divine any reaction . If either of the brothers had died , I thought the doctor would say so immediately . But he was speaking quietly , and no one in the family revealed any emotion other than bleached anxiety . "Ella
108335	108446	108448	108448	you	1926	"The sound was so quiet , I barely heard it through the blood - rush in my ears . I turned to look down the hallway . A man was coming toward me , his lean form clad in a pair of baggy scrub pants and a loose T - shirt . His arm was bandaged with silver - gray burn wrap . I knew the set of those shoulders , the way he moved . Jack . My eyes blurred , and I felt my pulse escalate to a painful throbbing . I began to shake from the effects of trying to encompass too much feeling , too fast . "Is
108450	108454	108448	108448	you	1926	" I choked . "Yes
108463	108567	108568	108568	Ella	0	."I was breaking down , every breath shattering . I gripped my elbows with my hands , crying harder as Jack drew closer . I could n't move . I was terrified that I was hallucinating , conjuring an image of what I wanted most , that if I reached out I would find nothing but empty space . But Jack was there , solid and real , reaching around me with hard , strong arms . The contact with him was electrifying . I flattened against him , unable to get close enough . He murmured as I sobbed against his chest . "
108587	108719	108720	108720	I	970	."But the relief of touching him , being close to him , had caused me to unravel . Not too late . The thought spurred a rush of euphoria . Jack was alive , and whole , and I would take nothing for granted ever again . I fumbled beneath the hem of his T - shirt and found the warm skin of his back . My fingertips encountered the edge of another bandage . He kept his arms firmly around me as if he understood that I needed the confining pressure , the feel of him surrounding me as our bodies relayed silent messages . Don't let go . I'm right here . Tremors kept running along my entire frame . My teeth chattered , making it hard to talk . "
108730	108752	108720	108720	I	970	"Jack 's mouth , usually so soft , was rough and chapped against my cheek , his jaw scratchy with bristle . "
108761	108799	108753	108753	I	970	" His voice was hoarse . I hid my face against his neck , breathing him in . His familiar scent had been obliterated by the antiseptic pungency of antiseptic burn dressings , and heavy saltwater brine . "
108805	108835	108753	108753	I	970	" Sniffling , I reached farther over his back , investigating the extent of the bandage . His fingers tangled in the smooth , soft locks of my hair . "
108848	108858	108753	108753	I	970	" I felt his cheek tauten with a smile . "
108867	108883	108753	108753	I	970	"We were both quiet for a moment . I realized he was trembling , too . "
108890	108919	108888	108888	Jack	580	" I said , and that started a whole new rush of tears , because I was so unholy glad to be able to say it to him . "
108945	108948	108949	108949	Jack	580	so—""I knew . "
108966	108969	108953	108953	He	580	"You did ? "
108976	108999	108973	108973	He	580	" I figured I could n't love you as much as I do , without you feeling something for me , too . "
109065	109079	109055	109055	I	970	" Your family 's in there . Why are you in the hallway ? "
109092	109105	109055	109055	I	970	" They 're . . . they 're letting you walk around like this?"Jack
109110	109152	109107	109107	his	580	" They parked me in a room around the corner to wait for a couple more tests . I asked if anyone had told you I was okay , and nobody knew for sure . So I came to find you . ""You
109163	109169	109170	109170	His	580	tests?""I had to find you . "
109183	109195	109181	109181	him	580	" Let 's go back . . . you may have internal bleeding—"Jack
109200	109227	109181	109181	him	580	" I 'm fine . They already did a CT , and it was clean . They want to do an MRI just to be sure . ""What
109229	109243	109244	109244	They	1932	Joe?"A shadow crossed Jack 's face . Suddenly he looked young and anxious . "
109282	109298	109299	109299	I	970	""This is a world - class hospital with the best doctors and the best equipment , "
109312	109333	109335	109335	his	580	" They 'll fix him . They 'll do whatever they have to . But . . . was he burned badly?"He
109338	109361	109363	109363	Jack	580	" The only reason I got singed a little was because I had to push through some burning debris to find him . ""Oh
109367	109400	109363	109363	Jack	580	" I wanted to hear everything he 'd been through , every detail . I wanted to comfort him in every way possible . But there would be time for that later . "
109421	109429	109432	109432	you	1934	" I gave him a threatening glance . "
109449	109453	109454	109454	Jack	580	""They can wait . "
109462	109481	109454	109454	Jack	580	" You should see the redheaded nurse who was wheeling me around . Bossiest woman I ever met . "We
109488	109491	109492	109492	I	970	" Hey , "
109499	109505	109492	109492	I	970	" Look who I found . "Jack
109567	109570	109571	109571	Churchill	105	"You okay ? "
109578	109582	109571	109571	Churchill	105	"Yeah , Dad . ""Good
109584	109647	109648	109648	You	1939	" And Churchill touched his son 's face with a sort of gentle cuffing pat . Jack 's jaw quivered , and he cleared his throat roughly . He seemed relieved to turn to Hardy , with whom he exchanged a manly half - hug back - pat . Gage was last , taking Jack by the shoulders and surveying him intently . "
109653	109657	109658	109658	you	1939	" he commented . "Fuck
109660	109715	109658	109658	you	1939	" Jack said , and they embraced each other roughly , the two dark heads close together . Jack gave him a few forceful thumps on the back , but Gage , mindful of his brother 's condition , was far gentler . Jack swayed a little and was immediately pushed in a chair . "He
109719	109738	109741	109741	you	1939	" I said , going to the water dispenser in the corner and filling up a paper cup . "Why
109746	109772	109773	109773	They	1940	" Churchill demanded , hovering over him . Jack showed him his hand , where an IV needle was still inserted and anchored with tape . "
109804	109806	109807	109807	Gage	98	""Pussy , "
109824	109828	109829	109829	Jack	580	"How 's Joe ? "
109860	109967	109856	109856	Gage	98	" The doctor said Joe has a concussion and a mild case of blast lung injury . It may take a while for the lungs to get back to speed , maybe up to a year . But it could have been a lot worse . Joe 's in respiratory distress and has borderline hypoxia — so they 're treating him with supplemental high - flow oxygen . He 'll be spending some serious time in ICU . And he can hear out of one ear , but not the other . At some point a specialist will tell us if the hearing loss is permanent . ""That
109971	109975	109976	109976	Joe	177	" Jack said . "
109981	109995	109996	109996	He	177	"Gage grinned briefly , but sobered as he stared at his younger brother . "
110009	110013	109996	109996	He	177	""Where?""Abdomen , mostly . "Jack
110017	110019	109996	109996	He	177	" How bad?"''We
110024	110026	109996	109996	He	177	""Shit . "
110036	110043	110028	110028	Jack	580	" I was afraid of that . ""Before
110049	110053	110044	110044	they	1941	" Liberty said , "
110061	110307	110055	110055	you	580	Jack?"Jack gestured for me to come to him , and he pulled me into his warm side as he spoke . It had been a clear morning , he said . Fishing had been decent , and they had gotten an early start back to the marina . But on the way they 'd seen a huge brown seaweed mat , about an acre in size . The mat had formed its own ecosystem with algae , barnacles , and small fish , all living amid the accumulated driftwood and mermaid purses . Figuring there was good fishing around or under the mat , the brothers had killed the engine and glided up to the seaweed . In just a few minutes Jack had hooked a Dorado , the rod nearly doubling and the reel screaming off a bunch of line as the acrobatic fish took off . It leapt from the water , revealing itself to be a five - footer , a monster , and Jack had followed around the boat to keep the line from catching . He had shouted to Joe to start the boat and go toward the fish , otherwise it would gain too much line . And just as he started to reel it in , Joe had started the engine and there had been an explosion . Jack fell silent at that point , blinking as he struggled to recall what had happened next . Hardy murmured , "
110315	110319	110055	110055	you	580	"Jack nodded slowly . "
110379	110391	110392	110392	He	177	" He looked agitated , his words coming in choppy bursts . "
110482	110488	110489	110489	Churchill	105	""And the weather came in , "
110495	110560	110561	110561	Joe	177	" Wind picked up , water got rough , and we were getting pushed away from the boat . I tried to stay with it , but it took too much energy . So I just held on to Joe , and the cooler , and I swore I would n't let go no matter how long it took for someone to find us . ""Was
110564	110568	110561	110561	Joe	177	" I asked . "Yeah
110592	110600	110584	110584	Joe	177	" Jack worked up a rueful smile . "
110618	110625	110629	110629	he	177	" He paused as everyone chuckled . "
110664	110675	110683	110683	I	970	" A stark , endless hesitation . He swallowed hard . "
110709	110724	110706	110706	I	970	" His voice broke , and he dropped his head , unable to finish . "You
110730	110762	110706	110706	I	970	" I whispered , putting my hand on his back , while Haven handed him a wad of Kleenex . It was too much , making him relive it so soon . "Thanks
110764	110781	110782	110782	you	1947	" Jack said gruffly after a minute , blowing his nose and letting out a sigh . "Here
110785	110822	110823	110824	Mr. Travis	2044	" A strident , accusatory voice came from the doorway , and we all looked up to behold a stout , redhaired nurse with a ruddy complexion , pushing an empty wheelchair into the waiting room . "
110841	110846	110847	110847	Jack	580	'"I took a break , "
110855	110910	110851	110852	The nurse	410	" That 's the last break you 'll get for a while — you 're getting a new IV needle put in , and you 're going for your MRI , and I may think up some extra tests to pay you back for scaring me half to death . Disappearing like that . . .""I
110914	110923	110925	110925	him	2044	" I said , urging Jack to stand . "
110934	110965	110925	110925	him	2044	"Jack shot me a narrow - eyed glance over his shoulder as he shuffled to the wheelchair . The nurse stared incredulously at his scrub pants and T - shirt . "
110972	110976	110985	110985	Travis	580	" she demanded . "Not
110979	110983	110985	110985	Travis	580	" he muttered . "Mr

111014	111024	111011	111011	Jack	580	" me wandering bare - assed around the hospital . ""With

111210	111249	111200	111200	she	1957	" I want this needle out of my hand . And I want to know what the hell 's going on with Joe . And I 've got a bitch of a headache , and my arm hurts . ""Why
111266	111271	111252	111252	you	1960	" I asked gently . "I
111289	111297	111287	111287	Joe	177	" He flipped through the TV channels . "

111881	111898	111876	111876	I	970	" He tore at his own shirt , flinching as it caught at the burn wrap . "Yes
111903	111912	111916	111916	Jack	580	" I was afraid he might hurt himself . "
111918	111920	111921	111921	he	580	Please—""Can't , "
111937	111941	111921	111921	he	580	"Let me help , "
112220	112222	112223	112223	Jack	580	"Easy , "
112567	112577	112578	112578	I	970	"Did you ever think it could be like that ? "
112581	112583	112584	112584	He	580	"Yes . "
112593	112599	112584	112584	He	580	" But only with you . "WE
112655	112659	112644	112644	he	580	"How is he ? "
112710	112713	112714	112714	Jack	580	"Stable condition . "
112724	112736	112738	112738	he	580	" He 's going to be fine . Tough as hell . ""Well
112743	112821	112738	112738	he	580	" I said reasonably . Climbing out of bed , I went to his dresser and pulled out a T - shirt , which hung past the tops of my thighs when I put it on . When I turned to face Jack , he was standing right there , tucking a lock of my hair behind my ear , and gazing down at me . No one had ever looked at me with such tender concern . "
112827	112861	112825	112825	Luke	2045	" he said gently . And as I stared into those velvety - dark eyes , I knew I could share anything with him . He would listen , and he would understand . "
112869	113274	112825	112825	Luke	2045	" I said , and went to the kitchen . Jack had set a cup and saucer beside the coffeemaker . I saw a piece of notepaper , folded lengthwise , standing in the empty cup . Perplexed , I opened the note and read : Dear Miss Independent , I've decided that of all the women I 've ever known , you are the only one I will ever love more than hunting , fishing , football , and power tools . You may not know this , but the other time I asked you to marry me , the night I put the crib together , I meant it . Even though I knew you were n't ready . God , I hope you 're ready now . Marry me , Ella . Because no matter where you go or what you do , I 'll love you every day for the rest of my life . — JackI felt no fear , reading those words . Only wonder , that so much happiness could be within my reach . Noticing something else in the cup , I reached in and pulled out a diamond ring , the stone round and glittering . My breath caught as I turned it in the light . I tried on the ring , and it slid neatly onto my finger . Picking up a nearby pen , I turned over the paper and wrote my answer in a flourishing scrawl . I poured my coffee , added cream and sweetener , and went back into the bedroom with the note . Jack was sitting on the edge of the bed , his head tilted slightly as he watched me . His simmering gaze took me in from head to toe , lingering at the diamond sparkling on my hand . I saw his chest rise and fall with a quick breath . Sipping my coffee , I approached him and handed him the note . Dear Jack , I love you , too . And I think I know the secret to a long and happy marriage — just choose someone you ca n't live without . For me , that would be you . So if you insist on being traditional . . .Yes.—EllaJack let out a pent - up sigh . He took my hips in his hands as I stood before him . "
113278	113288	113289	113289	I	970	" he murmured , drawing me between his thighs . "
113301	113324	113289	113289	I	970	"Taking care not to spill my coffee , I leaned forward and pressed my lips against his , letting our tongues touch . "
113335	113355	113334	113335	Jack Travis?"His	302	Travis?"His lashes lowered as he glanced at my damp lower lip . His accent was as thick as sorghum . "
113373	113416	113334	113335	Jack Travis?"His	302	" Taking the coffee from me , he finished it in a few swallows and set the cup aside , disregarding my laughing protest . He kissed me until my arms were twined around his neck and my knees threatened to buckle . "Ella
113418	113430	113431	113431	you	1977	" he said , finishing the kiss with a gentle nuzzle , "
113441	113445	113446	113446	I	970	you?""Of course not . "
113474	113477	113334	113335	Jack Travis?"His	302	" Why would I?""You
113488	113530	113334	113335	Jack Travis?"His	302	""You're the only man who could make me believe that it 's for me , too . Although when you get down to it , love is what 's real . I still say marriage is just a piece of paper . "Jack
113533	113539	113540	113540	he	970	" Let 's find out , "
113792	113801	113785	113785	she	2035	"I wonder what 's going on with her , "
113808	113840	113802	113802	I	970	" She has n't said anything about my weight or my hairstyle , and I have n't had to listen to any gross stories about her sex life or grooming habits . ""I
113858	113862	113863	113863	I	970	" he said . "
113888	113891	113892	113892	I	970	""Jack Travis ! "
113898	113921	113923	113923	she	2035	" Are you going to start buying her big - ticket items every six months as a reward for impersonating a decent human being?""I
113929	114202	113923	113923	she	2035	" he said . As for Jack 's side of the family , I found them colorful , affectionate , argumentative , fascinating . They were a real family , and they made a place for me , and I loved them for it . I quickly grew fond of Churchill , who was a kind and generous soul despite the fact that he did n't suffer fools gladly . We debated various subjects and annoyed each other with dueling political e - mails , and we made each other laugh , and he insisted that I sit right next to him at family dinners . After two weeks at Garner Hospital , Joe came home to recuperate at the mansion in River Oaks , which delighted Churchill nearly as much as it aggravated his son . Joe said he wanted privacy . He did n't like it that when anyone came to see him , they visited with his dad first . But Churchill , who hardly minded having so many attractive young women come to the house , retorted that if Joe did n't like it , he 'd better get well faster . As a result Joe was a model patient , determined to recover his health as soon as possible and get away from his interfering parent . I married Jack two months after he proposed , which shocked all of my friends and most of his , who had come to think of him as a perennial bachelor . I 'd heard some speculation that his near - death experience had helped him to readjust his priorities . "
114208	114214	113923	113923	she	2035	" Jack told everyone innocently . "
114224	114515	114217	114217	Ella	0	"The night before the wedding , my sister Tara came to the dinner for out - of - town guests . She was beautifully dressed in a pink suit , her hair upswept , diamond studs sparkling at her ears . And she was unescorted . I wanted to ask her how she was , if she was being treated well , if she was happy in her arrangement with Noah . But all thoughts of Tara 's relationship with Noah Cardiff disappeared as soon as I realized she had brought Luke . He was a gorgeous blue - eyed cherub who reached and grabbed for things , grinned , and drooled , and looked too adorable for words . I held out my arms eagerly , and Tara handed him to me . The cuddly weight of Luke on my chest , the scent and warmth of him , the round , searching eyes that tried to take everything in , all of it reminded me that I would never be quite whole without him . During the two months we had been apart , I had tried to console myself with the thought that in time the pain of Luke 's absence would fade , that I would forget and move on . But as I snuggled him close and smoothed his soft black hair , and he smiled as if he remembered me , I knew nothing had changed . Love did n't move on . I held Luke in my lap all during the formal dinner , once getting up to walk around with him , another time taking him upstairs to change his diaper , despite my sister 's protest that she could do it . "
114519	114546	114547	114547	I	970	" I told her , laughing as Luke grasped the strand of pearls I was wearing and attempted to cram some of them into his mouth . "
114565	114568	114569	114569	Tara	364	""Be careful , "
114578	114592	114593	114593	you	1988	" He rolls over now . He 'll roll right off the bed . ""Do
114595	114602	114593	114593	you	1988	" I asked Luke , enchanted . "
114621	114716	114618	114619	sweet baby	1989	"He gurgled in agreement , gnawing on the pearls . When Luke was freshly diapered , I took him toward the stairs , heading back down to dinner . I paused as I saw Jack and Tara ascending to the top of the flight , both of them absorbed in conversation . Jack glanced at me and smiled faintly , but his eyes were alert , and intent , and it seemed there was something he wanted to tell me . And Tara looked guarded . What in the world could they have been talking about?"Hey
114718	114726	114618	114619	sweet baby	1989	" I said , forcing a smile . "
114734	114738	114739	114739	Jack	580	touch?""Not at all , "
114743	114760	114761	114761	He	580	" You 've changed enough diapers , I did n't think you 'd forget so soon . "
114774	114801	114806	114807	the baby	2045	" Darlin ' , why do n't you let me take Luke for a few minutes ? He and I got some catching up to do . "I
114810	114814	114806	114807	the baby	2045	" Maybe a little later?"Jack
114827	114833	114834	114834	he	580	" Talk to your sister , "
114837	114843	114844	114844	her	1992	" And tell her yes . ""Tell
114847	114886	114844	114844	her	1992	what?"But he did n't answer . He pried the baby away from me , laid him against his shoulder , and patted his diapered bottom . Luke conformed to him bonelessly , content in Jack 's secure grip . "This
114892	114903	114844	114844	her	1992	" Tara told me , looking uncertain and almost bashful . "
114922	114943	114947	114947	Mom	2035	" I led her to a little upstairs sitting area , and we settled into soft leather - upholstered chairs . "
114949	114955	114947	114947	Mom	2035	" I asked in concern . "Lord
114959	114966	114967	114967	Mom	2035	" Tara raised her eyes heavenward . "
115009	115015	114995	114995	She	2035	""How are things with Noah ? "
115027	115029	115030	115030	she	2035	"Wonderful , "

115429	115434	115420	115420	I	970	" Her smile faded . "

115590	115617	115536	115536	I	970	" He does n't want Luke . He 's already got children . And having a baby around makes it hard for us to be together . ""Luke'll

115695	115734	115692	115692	I	970	"So what I 'm asking , Ella , is if you 'd like to take Luke for good . Jack said he thought you might . It 's the best thing for Luke , if you 're willing . "The
