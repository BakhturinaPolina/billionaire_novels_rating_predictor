42217	42333	42334	42334	I	0	" No . she 's scared to death of him . He 's as mean as a sack of snakes when he drinks . And he drinks most of the time . Ever since I could remember , he went in and out of jail ... come back every year or two , knock my mother around , get her pregnant , and leave with every cent we had . I tried to stop him once when I was eleven — that 's how my nose got broken . But the next time he came back , I 'd gotten big enough to beat the tar out of him . He never bothered us again . "

44151	44201	44145	44145	I	0	" Because I wanted you and could n't have you , and he was the nearest thing I could find to you . And every time I slept with him I wished it was you . and I hate you for that , even worse than I hate myself . "

70353	70362	70319	70319	he	3004	" Because then the new relationship is compromised . "

71337	71341	71263	71263	Her	940	" They do ? "
71342	71352	71300	71300	She	940	" It 's a turn - on for them . "
71353	71357	71263	71263	Her	940	" It is ? "
71378	71383	71384	71384	Angie	940	" Oh . girl . "
71391	71399	71384	71384	Angie	940	" You 've got to dump him . "

71743	71821	71740	71740	Alan	263	" You just think he is . But sooner or later a sixty - eight will show his true colors outside the bedroom . Leaving you at home while he goes out with his buddies . Buying himself a new car while you get the used one . A sixty - eight always takes the biggest slice of cake , honey . Do n't waste your time with him . Trust me , I know from experience . "

71831	71869	71828	71828	Heather	277	" I dated a sixty - eight a couple years ago , and at first he was , like , a total hottie . But he turned out to be the biggest jerk ever . Major bummer . "

72044	72075	72038	72038	Angie	940	" Tell him the relationship is n't going where you hoped it would . Say it 's no one 's fault , but it 's just not working for you . "
72076	72087	72088	72088	Alan	263	" And do n't drop the bomb at your place , "

72575	72592	72572	72572	I	0	" No , no , it 's not about that . It 's about Mr. Travis . "
72593	72600	72553	72553	Zenko	252	" Is he coming in today ? "
72609	72616	72601	72601	Alan	263	" I do n't think so . "

72689	72694	72695	72695	I	0	" Yes , sir , "
72699	72715	72638	72638	He	252	" Mr. Travis wants a trim at his home . Do you know the address ? "

72779	72808	72772	72772	he	252	" Mr. Travis specifically asked for you . He 's had a difficult time since the accident , and he indicated it might do him some good if — "

72853	72861	72862	72862	Zenko	252	" I thought you would already know , "
72865	72877	72862	72862	Zenko	252	" Mr. Travis was thrown from a horse two weeks ago . "

72995	73005	73006	73006	I	0	" No . I 'm fine . I just ... "
73171	73174	73175	73175	I	0	" Sure , "

73242	73248	73249	73249	Zenko	252	" It 's called security , "

74273	74306	74266	74266	Churchill	373	" Gretchen kicks up her heels every time she gets a chance . She 's had more than her fair share of men — she just wo n't marry any of 'em . "
74335	74343	74344	74344	She	283	" Liberty . I 'm Gretchen Travis . "
74391	74445	74375	74375	Her	283	" Churchill told me about you , but he did n't say what a pretty little thing you are . Are you thirsty , honey ? Is that bag heavy ? Leave it there and we 'll have someone carry it up for us . Do you know who you remind me of ? "
74461	74479	74449	74449	she	283	" Thank you , ma'am , but I 'm not thirsty . And I can carry this . "

74594	74618	74585	74585	she	283	" Just like she looked in Gilda , with that wavy hair and those long eyelashes . Did you ever see that movie ? "

74625	74639	74640	74640	She	283	" That 's all right . I do n't recall it ended well . "
74650	74678	74640	74640	She	283	" We could take the stairs . But this is so much easier . Never stand when you can sit and never walk when you can ride . "
74679	74684	74685	74685	I	0	" Yes , ma'am . "
74755	74759	74760	74760	I	0	" Miss Travis , "

74782	74809	74760	74760	I	0	" Gretchen , how is he ? I did n't know about his accident until today , or I would have sent flowers or a card — "
74810	74879	74774	74774	she	283	" Oh , honey , we do n't need flowers . There have been so many deliveries we do n't know what to do with them all . And we 've tried to keep it quiet about the accident . Churchill says he does n't want anyone making a fuss over him . I think it embarrasses him to death , what with the cast and the wheelchair — "
74880	74885	74760	74760	I	0	" A leg cast ? "
74886	74911	74912	74912	She	283	" A soft one for now . In two weeks he 'll get a hard cast . He had what the doctor said was ... "
74917	74975	74976	74976	She	283	" A comminuted fracture of the tibia , and the fibula broke clean through , and one of his ankle bones is busted too . They put eight long screws in his leg , and a rod on the outside they 'll take off later , and a metal plate that 'll stay in him for good . "
74979	74998	74976	74976	She	283	" He 'd never make it through airport security . Good thing he 's got his own plane . "
75085	75096	75097	75097	Gretchen	283	" Oh . Churchill 's as tough as they come , "
75109	75152	75097	75097	Gretchen	283	" You do n't need to worry about him , honey . It 's the rest of us you should be concerned about . He 'll be laid up for at least five months . We 'll all be crazy by then . "
75442	75447	75429	75429	his	373	" No , no , "
75453	75472	75429	75429	his	373	" No need for that . I 'll heal up just fine . You stop that , now . "
75490	75505	75506	75506	He	373	" So ... were you trying some kind of Lone Ranger stunt or what ? "
75509	75544	75506	75506	He	373	" I was riding with a friend on his property . A jackrabbit jumped out from a patch of mesquite and the horse spooked . I went head over heels before I could blink . "
75545	75554	75506	75506	He	373	" Is your back okay ? Your neck ? "
75555	75567	75568	75568	Churchill	373	" Yes , it 's all fine . Just the leg . "
75573	75628	75568	75568	Churchill	373	" I 'll be stuck in this chair for months . Nothing but crap on TV . I have to sit on a plastic chair in the shower . Everything brought to me , ca n't do a damn thing for myself . I 'm sick and tired of being treated like an invalid . "
75629	75635	75636	75636	I	0	" You are an invalid , "
75639	75651	75636	75636	I	0	" Ca n't you try to relax and enjoy the pampering ? "
75652	75655	75656	75656	Churchill	373	" Pampering ? "
75660	75701	75656	75656	Churchill	373	" I 've been ignored , neglected , and dehydrated . No one brings my meals on time . No one comes when I holler . No one fills my water jug . A lab rat lives better than this . "
75702	75707	75708	75708	Gretchen	283	" Now , Churchill , "
75711	75735	75708	75708	Gretchen	283	" We 're all doing our best . It 's a new routine for everyone . We 'll get the way of it . "
75783	75789	75790	75790	I	0	" I 'll get it , "
75894	75899	75900	75900	I	0	" One or two ? "
75908	75911	75900	75900	I	0	" Two . "
76091	76099	76100	76100	Churchill	373	" No one answers when I buzz . "
76128	76149	76112	76112	I	0	" You need a set of walkie - talkies . Then you can contact someone directly when you need something . "
76150	76162	76163	76163	he	373	" Gretchen ca n't even keep track of her cell phone , "
76166	76182	76163	76163	he	373	" There 's no way I 'd get her to carry a walkie - talkie . "
76183	76194	76112	76112	I	0	" Do n't you have a personal assistant or secretary ? "
76195	76199	76200	76200	he	373	" I did . "
76203	76211	76200	76200	he	373	" But I fired him last week . "
76212	76215	76112	76112	I	0	" Why ? "
76216	76235	76200	76200	he	373	" He could n't handle being yelled at . And he always had his head up his culo . "
76239	76258	76236	76236	I	0	" Well , you should have waited until you hired someone else before you got rid of him . "
76268	76276	76236	76236	I	0	" I have someone else in mind . "
76277	76282	76236	76236	I	0	" Who 's that ? "

76379	76392	76376	76376	He	373	" How long have you worked at Zenko 's ? Four years ? "
76393	76397	76373	76373	my	0	" Almost five . "
76398	76405	76376	76376	He	373	" What 's he paying you ? "
76437	76444	76445	76445	I	0	" Twenty - four a year , "

76463	76483	76445	76445	I	0	" That 's a lot of money . I bet he had to work his tail off for it . "
76484	76511	76373	76373	my	0	" Not really . He ran some errands , kept my schedule , made phone calls , typed on my book . That kind of stuff . "
76512	76519	76445	76445	I	0	" You 're writing another book ? "
76523	76558	76520	76520	He	373	" Mostly investment strategies . But part of it is autobiographical . I write some pages in longhand , others I dictate into a recorder . My assistant types it all into the computer . "
76559	76573	76574	76574	I	0	" It would be a lot more efficient if you typed it yourself . "
76590	76606	76520	76520	He	373	" Some things I 'm too old to learn . Typing is one of them . "
76607	76613	76574	76574	I	0	" So hire a temp . "
76614	76632	76520	76520	He	373	" I do n't want a temp . I want someone I know . Someone I trust . "
76686	76692	76693	76693	I	0	" I 'm a hairstylist , "
76700	76724	76693	76693	I	0	" not a secretary . And once I leave Zenko , that door is closed for good . I ca n't go back . "
76725	76735	76736	76736	Churchill	373	" It 's not a short - term offer , "
76758	76808	76753	76753	he	373	" There 's lots of work around here . Liberty . Most of it will challenge you a hell of a lot more than fooling with people 's cuticles . Now , settle your feathers — there 's nothing wrong with your job , and you do it well — "
76809	76814	76693	76693	I	0	" Gee , thanks . "
76815	76855	76753	76753	he	373	" — but you could learn a lot from me . I 'm still a ways out from retirement , and I 've got a lot to get done . I need help from someone I can depend on . "
76866	76877	76856	76856	I	0	" What makes you think you can depend on me ? "
76878	76885	76886	76886	he	373	" You 're not a quitter , "
76889	76914	76886	76886	he	373	" You stick with things . You meet life head - on . That counts a hell of a lot more than typing skills . "
76915	76929	76856	76856	I	0	" You say that now . But you have n't seen my typing . "
76930	76937	76886	76886	he	373	" You 'll pick it up . "
76944	76963	76938	76938	I	0	" So you 're too old to learn your way around a keyboard , but I 'm not ? "
76964	76969	76856	76856	I	0	" That 's right . "
77116	77125	77100	77100	I	0	" What if it did n't work out ? "
77131	77141	77100	77100	I	0	" Would I get a couple weeks ' notice ? "

77168	77174	77100	77100	I	0	" What about health insurance ? "
77175	77191	77149	77149	he	373	" I 'll put you and Carrington on the same policy as my own family . "
77277	77288	77289	77289	Churchill	373	" You write out a list of what you want , "
77292	77320	77289	77289	Churchill	373	" I 'm not going to peck over the details . You know me . You know I 'll be fair . There 's only one nonnegotiable . "
77321	77326	77327	77327	I	0	" What 's that ? "
77341	77351	77289	77289	Churchill	373	" I want you and Carrington to live here . "
77367	77378	77379	77379	he	2034	" Gretchen and I both need someone at the house , "
77382	77468	77379	77379	he	2034	" I 'm in a wheelchair , and even after I 'm out of it , I 'll have a hitch in my get - along . And Gretchen 's been having some problems lately , including memory loss . She claims she 's going back to her own house someday , but the truth is she 's here for good . I want someone to keep track of her appointments as well as mine . I do n't want it to be some stranger . "

93166	93195	93161	93161	He	0	" It should n't take a long time to figure out if someone is right for you . If it does , you 're either dense or blind . "
93196	93205	93161	93161	He	0	" Or maybe you 're dating an armadillo . "
93213	93216	93206	93206	Gage	271	" Pardon ? "
93217	93234	93161	93161	He	0	" I mean someone who 's hard to set to know . Shy and heavily armored . "

93323	93337	93287	93287	He	271	" It means you accuse me of the same things you 're guilty of "

93353	93362	93343	93343	I	0	" No wonder all your relationships are short . "

93587	93593	93584	93584	I	0	" What tipped you off ? "
93594	93625	93561	93561	he	271	" The fact that he wants me to come over every morning to help him shower . If you were his girlfriend , you 'd be in there with him . "

93735	93741	93732	93732	I	0	" But you never complain . "
93742	93752	93753	93753	he	271	" My pain is nothing compared to Dad 's , "
93756	93778	93753	93753	he	271	" Besides , I consider it payback . I was a pain in the ass to him when I was younger . "

93930	93964	93922	93922	I	0	" It 's nice , actually . It keeps me from wasting time with the wrong men . If a guy is scared by the responsibility , he 's not right for us . "
93965	93981	93882	93882	he	271	" But you 've never known what it 's like to be single and childless . "
93982	93989	93922	93922	I	0	" I 've never minded that . "
93990	93993	93882	93882	he	271	" Really . "

94383	94414	94415	94415	I	0	" I appreciate your concern , but I 've driven my rust bucket through Houston many times , much later than this . And I 've got my cell phone . "

95368	95393	95355	95355	Gage	271	" She 's never met a cause she did n't like . It was the biggest disappointment of her life not to be disenfranchised . "
95765	95771	95754	95754	he	271	" What are you doing ? "
95782	95789	95790	95790	Gage	271	" Just performing a little surgery , "

99804	99855	99794	99794	We	2418	" Carrington ... I'm going to try not to be a wet blanket all the time . It 's just that you 're getting to the age when most of the things you want to do for fun will also be the things that drive me crazy worrying about you . "

99878	99911	99875	99875	I	0	" God . I 'm not asking for blind obedience . But we have to find ways of compromising when we disagree on something . You know what compromise is , right ? "
99912	99954	99867	99867	Carrington	1038	" Uh - huh . It 's when you do n't get to have everything your way and I do n't get to have everything my way , and no one 's happy . Like when Gage lowered the zip line . "
99958	99963	99955	99955	I	0	" That 's right . "

100074	100114	100068	100068	I	0	" Well , I thought he 'd say something to you . since he always has an opinion about things . And since you did n't come inside right away , I assumed you two were having a conversation . "
100115	100159	100048	100048	I	0	" We were . He said I should know that being a parent is n't near as easy as it looks , and even though you are n't my actual mom , you 're the best stand - in he 's ever seen . "

100708	100729	100697	100697	Churchill	373	" Why the hell 's he doing that ? He was supposed to meet with the Canadians from Syncrude today . "

102362	102400	102406	102406	he	271	" I have no idea why he was so damned impatient to get everyone together tonight . The only reason I came was because I hoped you and I might find a few minutes to talk afterward . "
102409	102412	102406	102406	he	271	" Alone . "
102421	102424	102406	102406	he	271	" Okay . "

102630	102656	102625	102626	my sister	2920	" Got too much homework . So I 'm going with Aunt Gretchen to her book club meeting , and I 'll do it there . "
102661	102690	102657	102657	Gretchen	2920	" I just remembered my book club meeting . I ca n't miss it . The girls are very strict about attendance . Two unexcused absences , and — "

102711	102760	102761	102761	She	2920	" Oh ; honey , you ca n't imagine . Once you 're out , you 're out for good . And then I 'd have to find something else to do Tuesday nights , and the only thing going on besides the book club is Bunko Group . "
102767	102775	102761	102761	She	2920	" You know how I hate Bunko . "
102776	102781	102761	102761	She	2920	" No I did n't "
102782	102788	102789	102789	she	2920	" Bunko makes you fat , "
102793	102803	102789	102789	she	2920	" All that snacking . And at my age — "
102804	102809	102810	102810	Gage	271	" Where 's Dad ? "
102817	102850	102813	102813	Carrington	1038	" Uncle Churchill said to tell you his leg is bothering him so he 's going to stay in tonight and watch a movie with his friend Vivian when she gets here . "
102851	102862	102863	102863	Gretchen	2920	" But since you two are dressed up so nice , "
102866	102878	102863	102863	Gretchen	2920	" you go on without us and have a good time . "
102907	102919	102902	102902	I	0	" I had nothing to do with this , I swear — "

102985	103015	102982	102982	I	0	" You must be tired after your trip to New York . And I 'm guessing Dawnelle would n't be too happy about the idea of us going out . "
103020	103030	102982	102982	I	0	" Actually .. .Dawnelle and I broke up yesterday . "
103093	103098	103099	103099	I	0	" I 'm sorry , "
103103	103121	103099	103099	I	0	" Is that why you went to New York ? To ... to break up with her ? "
103166	103170	103171	103171	he	271	" I realized . "
103174	103213	103171	103171	he	271	" if I 'd become so obsessed with a woman I could n't sleep at night , thinking about her .. .it did n't make sense for me to be going out with someone else , did it ? "
103257	103268	103271	103271	him	271	" So ... do we go along with the setup ? "
103385	103401	103375	103375	his	271	" I 'd hate to give them the satisfaction/ ' I said , and he smiled .
103402	103418	103419	103419	His	271	" You 're right . On the other hand ... we do have to eat . "
103426	103437	103438	103438	He	271	" And you 're too pretty to stay home tonight . "
103452	103460	103438	103438	He	271	" Let 's get out of here . "
103685	103695	103672	103672	He	271	" All right if I make a quick call ? "
103696	103700	103672	103672	He	271	" Of course . "
103777	103823	103767	103767	He	271	" You know , Dad , I just got back from New York two hours ago . I have n't even had time to unpack my luggage . This may be a shocker , but I do n't always do things according to your timetable . "
103829	103832	103833	103833	Gage	271	" Yeah , "
103836	103865	103866	103866	He	271	" I got that . But I 'm warning you — from now on take care of your own damn love life and do n't mess with mine . "
103875	103879	103880	103880	he	271	" Old geezer , "
103883	103889	103890	103890	I	0	" He meddles with everyone , "
103906	103915	103890	103890	I	0	" It 's his way of showing affection . "
103923	103927	103916	103916	Gage	271	" No kidding . "
103934	103947	103916	103916	Gage	271	" Did he know you were going to break up with Dawnelle ? "
103948	103955	103916	103916	Gage	271	" Yes , I told him . "
103976	103990	103991	103991	I	0	" So that 's why he calmed down after he talked to you , "
103994	104007	103991	103991	I	0	" I guess he was n't a big fan of Dawnelle 's . "
104008	104032	103961	103961	he	373	" I do n't think he cared much about Dawnelle one way or the other . But he cares a lot about you . "
104056	104065	104066	104066	I	0	" Churchill cares about a lot of people , "
104073	104092	104066	104066	I	0	" Not really . He 's pretty guarded with most people . I take after him that way . "
104136	104145	104146	104146	I	0	" He told me about you for years , "
104149	104213	104146	104146	I	0	" And about your brothers and sister . Whenever he visited the salon , he 'd give me an update on the family , and it seemed you and he were always in the middle of some kind of argument . But I could tell he was proudest of you . Even when he was complaining about you , it sounded like bragging . "
104218	104226	104214	104214	Gage	271	" He 's not usually that talkative . "
104227	104240	104146	104146	I	0	" You 'd be surprised what people say across the manicure table . "
104252	104309	104241	104241	He	271	" Dad is the last man in the world I 'd ever expect to go for a manicure . When I first heard about it , I wondered what kind of woman could get him to do such a thing . As you can guess , it caused more than a little speculation in the family . "
104323	104331	104332	104332	I	0	" I never asked him for anything , "
104341	104362	104332	104332	I	0	" I never thought of him as a ... you know , sugar daddy .. .there were no presents or — "

104371	104380	104367	104367	he	271	" it 's okay . I get it . "

104392	104401	104385	104385	I	0	" Well , I know how it looked . "
104402	104429	104367	104367	he	271	" I realized right away nothing was going on . I figured any man who slept with you would never let you out of his bed . "
104580	104589	104590	104590	Gage	271	" Are we going to talk about it ? "
104601	104605	104606	104606	I	0	" About what ? "
104613	104618	104609	104609	He	271	" I guess not . "
104708	104714	104715	104715	Gage	271	" We can go anywhere , "
104722	104738	104715	104715	Gage	271	" If you do n't like the look of this place , just tell me . "
104739	104748	104715	104715	Gage	271	" I 'm sure it will be wonderful . "

104942	104988	104933	104933	I	0	" Oh , I do n't know ... to start with , Paris , maybe . Or London , or Florence . When Carrington gets a little older I 'm going to save enough to take us on one of those bus tours through Europe ... "
104989	105002	105003	105003	he	271	" You do n't want to see Europe through a bus window . "
105006	105011	104933	104933	I	0	" I do n't ? "
105012	105027	105028	105028	He	271	" No . You want to go with someone who knows the right places . "
105039	105043	105028	105028	He	271	" Which one ? "
105053	105062	105044	105044	I	0	" What do you mean , which one ? "

105085	105095	105079	105079	I	0	" Are we taking the Gulfstream or the Citation ? "
105096	105104	105044	105044	I	0	" For Europe , definitely the Gulfstream . "
105112	105121	105122	105122	I	0	" I do n't even own a suitcase . "
105127	105139	105079	105079	I	0	" I 'll buy whatever you need when we get there . "
105140	105149	105079	105079	I	0	" You said you were tired of traveling . "
105150	105173	105174	105174	His	271	" I meant business traveling . Besides , I 'd like to see Paris with someone who 's never been there before . "
105178	105191	105174	105174	His	271	" It would be like seeing it for the first time again . "

105247	105270	105079	105079	I	0	" All right , it would scare me . I do n't know you well enough to take a trip with you . "

120717	120736	120702	120702	Hardy	3004	" Carrington . you 're even prettier than your mama was . You probably do n't remember me . "
120737	120749	120750	120750	Carrington	1038	" You drove us to the hospital when I was bom . "
120754	120774	120702	120702	Hardy	3004	" That 's right . In an old blue pickup , through a storm that flooded half of Welcome . "
120775	120783	120784	120784	Carrington	1038	" That 's where Miss Marva lives , "
120787	120793	120784	120784	Carrington	1038	" Do you know her ? "

120805	120831	120802	120802	Hardy	3004	" Yes , ma'am , I do . I had more than a few helpings of red velvet cake at Miss Marva 's kitchen counter . "
120844	120856	120835	120835	Carrington	1038	" Liberty , you did n't say he knew Miss Marva ! "
120873	120875	120878	120878	you	2693	" I never
120881	120895	120878	120878	you	2693	" I said to Hardy . My voice sounded odd to my own ears .
120916	120919	120920	120920	Gretchen	2920	" Well , "
120924	120957	120920	120920	Gretchen	2920	" you all go on and have a good time . You be careful around the horses , Carrington . Remember what I told you about not going near the back hooves . "

121350	121421	121340	121342	So many women	2707	" The hardest part was right after Mama died . I do n't think I had a full night 's sleep in two years . I was working and taking classes and trying to do my best for Carrington . It seemed like everything was always half - done , we were never on time , I could n't seem to get anything right . But eventually everything got easier . "
121422	121433	121450	121450	Hardy	3004	" Tell me how you got involved with the Travises . "
121434	121438	121439	121439	I	0	" Which one ? "

122166	122197	122154	122154	She	1038	" That 's our old friend Hardy — he took us riding , and I was on a black pony named Prince , and I rode like a real cowgirl ! "

122575	122582	122567	122567	Gage	271	" Nothing worth talking about yet . "
122583	122612	122613	122613	Hardy	3004	" Not what I heard . Rumor has it you managed to cut down on the NOX emissions .. .but the biofuel itself is still expensive as hell . "
122618	122623	122613	122613	Hardy	3004	" Oil 's cheaper . "
122624	122628	122567	122567	Gage	271	" For now . "

123377	123480	123366	123366	Gage	271	" I think he 's ambitious to the bone , works hard and plays harder . He 's hungry for all the visible signs of success — the cars , the women , the house , the owner 's box at Reliant . I think he 'll throw away every principle he 's got to climb up the ladder . He 'll make and lose a couple of fortunes , and he 'll go through three or four wives . And he wants you because you 're his last hope of keeping it real . But even you would n't be enough . "

123785	123836	123780	123780	I	0	" Gage is ... accomplished . But he can be intimidating . The problem with Gage is , he always seems to do everything perfectly . People think he 's invulnerable . And he 's very private . It 's not easy to get close to a man like that . "
123837	123844	123752	123752	Hardy	3004	" But you have , apparently . "
123850	123865	123845	123845	I	0	" Sort of . We 'd just started to get close ... but then ... "

123948	124005	123932	123932	I	0	" There 's a huge biofuel deal in the works . He wants to build a blending facility at this huge refinery in Dallas , and they 're going to start mixing biodiesel with all their fuel , and distribute it everywhere in Texas . From what I can tell , the negotiations are pretty intense . "

124031	124042	124043	124043	Hardy	3004	" He must have gotten past some damn big hurdles . "

125271	125312	125264	125264	Hardy	3004	" But they 're not , Liberty . You think they 've done you a favor , taking you and Carrington in ? It was no fucking favor . They owe you a hell of a lot more than that . "
125313	125320	125264	125264	Hardy	3004	" Why do you say that ? "
125340	125359	125321	125321	He	3004	" You really do n't know , do you ? I thought you might at least suspect something . "
125360	125367	125373	125373	He	3004	" What are you talking about ? "
125392	125407	125373	125373	He	3004	" Your mother had an affair with Churchill Travis . It lasted for years . "
125420	125426	125427	125427	I	0	" That 's not true . "
125430	125449	125427	125427	I	0	" Marva told me . You can ask her yourself . Your mother told her all about it . "
125450	125460	125373	125373	He	3004	" Why did n't Marva say anything to me ? "
125461	125542	125427	125427	I	0	" She was afraid for you to know . Afraid for you to get tangled up with the Travises . For all she knew , they might have decided to take Carrington away from you , and you could n't have done a damn thing to stop them . Later , when she found out you were working for Churchill , she figured he was trying to make it up to you . She thought it best not to intefere . "
125543	125567	125373	125373	He	3004	" You 're not making sense . Why would they have wanted to take Carrington away from me ? What could Churchill have — "
125600	125612	125590	125590	Hardy	3004	" Liberty ... who do you think Carrington 's father is ? "
125740	125746	125728	125728	I	0	" This is our daddy , "
126044	126047	126033	126033	Gage	271	" Liberty ... "

126179	126184	126185	126185	he	271	" It would help . "
126192	126204	126185	126185	he	271	" if you 'd tell me what we 're talking about . "
126205	126245	126185	126185	he	271	" You know exactly why I 'm angry . You hired someone to follow me . You 've been spying on me . I do n't understand why . I 've done nothing to deserve being treated like this — "
126246	126250	126185	126185	he	271	" Calm down . "
126276	126297	126185	126185	he	271	" I do n't want to calm down . I want to know why the hell you 've done this ! "
126298	126305	126306	126306	Gage	271	" If you kept your promise . "
126310	126325	126306	126306	Gage	271	" you have no reason to worry about someone keeping an eye on you . "
126326	126368	126185	126185	he	271	" Then you admit you hired someone to follow me ? Oh , God , you did , I can see it on your face . Damn you , I have n't slept with him . You should have trusted me . "
126369	126384	126306	126306	Gage	271	" I 've always believed in the old saying ' Trust but verify . ' "
126385	126393	126394	126394	I	0	" That may work great for business , "
126401	126428	126394	126394	I	0	" but not in a relationship . I want it stopped now . I do n't want to be followed anymore . Get rid of him ! "
126429	126436	126394	126394	I	0	" All right . All right . "
126545	126548	126549	126549	he	2780	" Liberty , "
126553	126603	126549	126549	he	2780	" I know you have n't slept with him . I do trust you . Damn it . I 'm sorry . I could n't stand back and wait when I wanted something — someone — this badly . I ca n't let go of you without a fight . "
126604	126620	126549	126549	he	2780	" Is this all about winning ? Is it some kind of contest to you ? "
126621	126662	126663	126663	His	2782	" No , it 's not a contest . I want you . I want things I 'm not sure you 're ready to hear about yet . Most of all I want to hold you until you stop shaking . "
126668	126676	126663	126663	His	2782	" Let me hold you , Liberty . "
126712	126715	126716	126716	he	2782	" Please , "
126731	126737	126724	126724	he	2782	" There 's my girl , "

127227	127231	127232	127232	Gage	271	" Ignore it , "

127654	127691	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" Baby , it 's me . I had a sleepover at Gage 's last night . I 'm sorry I did n't call you — by the time I remembered , it was too late . "
127692	127699	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" Oh . that 's okay , "
127704	127732	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" Aunt Gretchen made popcorn , and she and Churchill and I watched the silliest old movie with lots of singing and dancing . It was great . "
127733	127741	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" Are you getting ready for school ? "
127742	127756	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" Yes , the driver 's going to take me in the Bentley . "
127769	127779	127757	127757	I	0	" You sound just like a River Oaks kid . "
127780	127794	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" I have to finish my breakfast . My cereal 's getting soggy . "
127795	127831	127757	127757	I	0	" All right . Carrington . would you do something for me ? Tell Churchill I 'll be there in about half an hour , and I need to talk to him about something important . "
127832	127836	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" About what ? "
127837	127847	127757	127757	I	0	" Grown - up stuff . I love you . "
127848	127855	127700	127701	my sister	2920	" Love you too . Bye ! "
127938	127941	127942	127942	he	373	" Morning . "
127949	127957	127921	127921	he	373	" Morning . How are you feeling ? "
127958	127965	127921	127921	he	373	" Fair enough . And you ? "
127966	127972	127973	127973	I	0	" I 'm not sure , "
127977	127991	127973	127973	I	0	" Nervous , I guess . A little angry . A lot confused . "
128046	128052	128053	128053	I	0	" You knew my mother , "
128081	128087	128088	128088	He	373	" I loved your mother . "
128104	128126	128088	128088	He	373	" Help me move to the sofa ; Liberty . The chair seat 's digging into the backs of my legs . "
128256	128265	128252	128252	her	2932	" To my darling C. love , Diana . "
128266	128277	128278	128278	Churchill	373	" Her father — your grandfather — worked for me , "
128299	128361	128278	128278	Churchill	373	" I was already a widower when I met Diana at a company picnic . Gage was barely out of diapers . He needed a mother , and I needed a wife . It was obvious from the start Diana was wrong in just about every way . Too young , too pretty , too fiery . None of that mattered . "
128371	128380	128362	128362	He	373	" My God , I loved that woman . "
128410	128420	128421	128421	Churchill	373	" I went after her with everything I had , "
128424	128479	128421	128421	Churchill	373	" Whatever I thought would tempt her . I told her right off I wanted to marry her . She got pressure from all sides , especially her family . The Truitts were middle - class , and they knew if Diana married me there was no limit to what I 'd give 'em . "
128485	128494	128421	128421	Churchill	373	" I made sure Diana knew that too . "
128516	128527	128507	128514	a woman with every weapon at his disposal	2803	" Jesus , what a circus it must have been . "
128528	128550	128551	128551	He	373	" I bullied , bribed , and talked her into loving me . I got an engagement ring on her finger . "
128563	128575	128551	128551	He	373	" Give me long enough and I grow on a person . "
128576	128589	128590	128590	I	0	" Did Mama really love you . or was it an act ? "
128616	128634	128607	128607	he	373	" There were moments I think she did . But in the end it was n't enough . "
128635	128654	128551	128551	He	373	" What happened ? Was it Gage ? She did n't want to be a mother so soon ? "
128655	128694	128607	128607	he	373	" No , it had nothing to do with that . She seemed to like the boy well enough , and I promised her we 'd hire nannies and housemaids , all the help she 'd ever need . "
128695	128707	128551	128551	He	373	" Then what ? I ca n't imagine why ... Oh . "
128756	128761	128762	128762	Churchill	373	" That 's right , "
128773	128796	128762	128762	Churchill	373	" Your daddy was everything I was n't . Young , handsome , and as my daughter Haven would say , disenfranchised . "
128797	128801	128762	128762	Churchill	373	" Also Mexican . "
128805	128829	128802	128802	Churchill	373	" That did n't go over big with your grandfather . In those days , marriage between brown and white was frowned upon . "
128830	128840	128841	128841	I	0	" That 's a nice way of putting it , "
128855	128874	128841	128841	I	0	" Knowing my mother , the Romeo and Juliet scenario probably made the whole thine even more attractive . "
128875	128881	128882	128882	Churchill	373	" She was a romantic . "
128896	128931	128882	128882	Churchill	373	" And she had a passion for your daddy . Her father warned if she ran off with him , not to bother coming back . She knew the family would never forgive her . "
128932	128943	128944	128944	I	0	" Because she fell in love with a poor guy ? "
128949	128955	128956	128956	Churchill	373	" It was n't right , "
128959	128965	128956	128956	Churchill	373	" But times were hard . "
128966	128972	128882	128882	Churchill	373	" That 's no excuse . "
128973	129038	128956	128956	Churchill	373	" Diana came to me the night she ran off to get married . Your father waited out in the car while she came in and said goodbye and gave back the ring . I would n't take it . I told her to trade it for a wedding present . And I begged her to come to me if she ever needed anything . "
129056	129065	129066	129066	I	0	" And by the time my father died , "
129069	129076	129066	129066	I	0	" you 'd already married Ava . "
129077	129082	129066	129066	I	0	" That 's right . "
129143	129149	129150	129150	I	0	" She came to you . "
129153	129175	129150	129150	I	0	" Even though you were married . She visited you and you gave her money . You helped her for years . "
129205	129210	129192	129192	I	0	" Is Carrington yours ? "
129226	129269	129219	129219	he	363	" You think I would n't take responsibility for my own child ? Let her be raised in a damn trailer park ? No , there 's no chance she 's mine . Diana and I never had that kind of relationship . "
129270	129283	129211	129211	Color	363	" Come off it , Churchill . I 'm not an idiot . "
129284	129302	129219	129219	he	363	" Your mother and I never slept together . You think I 'd do that to Ava ? "
129303	129322	129211	129211	Color	363	" Sorry , but I do n't buy it . Not if she was getting money from you . "
129323	129341	129342	129342	he	2809	" Honey , I do n't give a fuck - all if you believe me or not , "
129346	129384	129342	129342	he	2809	" Not saying I was n't tempted . But I was physically faithful to Ava . I owed her at least that much . You want me to take a paternity test , I 'll do it . "
129389	129454	129387	129387	me	0	" Okay . I 'm sorry . Sorry . I 'm just ... it 's hard to accept that my mother went to you for money all those years . She always made such a big deal about never taking handouts from people and how I needed to be self - reliant when I grew up . That makes her a big fat hypocrite . "
129455	129493	129494	129494	Churchill	373	" It makes her a parent who wanted the best for her child . She did the best she could . I wanted to do a lot more for her , but she would n't let me . "
129501	129515	129494	129494	Churchill	373	" I did n't see her at all the year before she died . "
129516	129528	129529	129529	I	0	" She was wrapped up with a guy she was dating , "
129532	129537	129529	129529	I	0	" A real scumbag . "

129556	129562	129551	129551	Churchill	373	" Read the accident report . "

129592	129617	129589	129589	I	0	" I always wondered who it was . And the yellow roses ... you've been sending them all these years , have n't you ? "

129644	129665	129640	129640	I	0	" That was you . You paid for it . You got the funeral director to go along with it . "
129666	129678	129679	129679	he	373	" It was the last thing I could do for Diana . "
129682	129693	129679	129679	he	373	" That , and keep an eye on her daughters . "
129694	129702	129703	129703	I	0	" Keep an eye on us how ? "

129868	129868	129866	129866	you	206	"
129869	129876	129792	129792	He	206	" I wanted to help you . "
129884	129940	129877	129877	I	0	" I did n't want any help ! I could have done it on my own . Damn you . Churchill ! First you were Mama 's sugar daddy and then you were mine , except I did n't even have a choice about it . Do you know how stupid that makes me feel ? "

130004	130052	129941	129941	His	0	" Fair enough . I 'll take the scholarship money out of your salary . But not the money for the casket . I did that for her , not for you . Sit down , we 're not done talking . I got more to say . "
130053	130056	130057	130057	I	0	" Great . "
