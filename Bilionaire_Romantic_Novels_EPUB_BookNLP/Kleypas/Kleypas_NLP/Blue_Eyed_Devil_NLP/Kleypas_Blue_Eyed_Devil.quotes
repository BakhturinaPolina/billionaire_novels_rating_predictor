1598	1644	1589	1589	I	349	" I loud . I had made arrangements for the leftovers to be taken to a number of Houston shelters , which my family had thought was a fine idea . I still fell guilty . A faux liberal , wailing in line for caviar . "
1649	1661	1589	1589	I	349	" I asked Nick as we went to the vodka fountain , "
1702	1709	1712	1712	I	349	" Nick pretended to look puzzled . "
1720	1730	1712	1712	I	349	" He ran his fingertips over my bare shoulder . "
1751	1878	1745	1745	I	349	" Although we were both native Texans , we 'd found each other in Massachusetts . I had gone to Wellesley and Nick went to Tufts . I 'd met him at an around - the - world party that was held in a big rambling house in Cambridge . Each room was designated a different country , featuring a national drink . Vodka in Russia , whiskey in Scotland , and so forth . Somewhere between South America and Japan , I 'd staggered into a dark - haired boy with clear hazel eyes and a self - confident grin . He had a long , sinewy runner 's body and an intellectual look . To my delight , he spoke with a Texas accent . "
1900	1901	1902	1902	You	345	" "
1907	1922	1902	1902	You	345	" I 'd said . His smile had widened as he heard my accent . "

1978	2064	1975	1976	a Yankee	347	" Nick had led me outside , where we 'd sat on the doorstep and talked in the freezing cold for two hours . We had fallen in love very fast . I would do anything for Nick , go anywhere with him . I was going to marry him . I would be Mrs. Nicholas Tanner . Haven Travis Tanner . No one was going to stop me . When I finally had my turn to dance with my father , Al Jarreau was singing "
2068	2376	2377	2377	I	349	" with silky cheerfulness . Nick had gone to the bar with my brothers Jack and Joe , and he would meet me in the house later . Nick was the first man I 'd ever brought home , the first man I 'd ever been in love with . Also the only one I 'd ever slept with . I had never dated much . My mother had died of cancer when I was fifteen , and for a couple of years after that I 'd been too depressed and guilty even to think about having a love life . And then I 'd gone to a women 's college , which was great for my education but not so great for my love life . It was n't just the all - female environment that kept me from having relationships , however . Lots of women went to parties off campus , or met guys while taking extra courses at Harvard or MIT . The problem was me . I lacked some essential skill for attracting people , for giving and receiving love easily . It meant too much to me . I seemed to be driving away the people I most wanted . Finally I had realized that getting someone to love you was like trying to coax a bird to perch on your finger . . . it would n't happen unless you stopped trying so hard . So I 'd given up , and as the cliché went , that was when it happened . I met Nick , and we fell in love . He was the one I wanted . That should have been enough for my family . But they had n't accepted him . Instead I found myself answering questions they had n't even asked , saying things like "
2382	2384	2385	2385	Nick	285	" or "
2391	2393	2385	2385	Nick	285	" or "
2401	2434	2435	2435	I	349	" Their lack of interest in him , in the history or future of our relationship , aggravated me beyond bearing . It was a judgment in itself , this ominous silence . "
2440	2596	2438	2438	sweetie	349	" my best friend , Todd , had said when I called to complain . We had known each other since the age of twelve , when his family had moved to River Oaks . Todd 's father , Tim Phelan , was an artist who 'd been featured at all the big museums , including MoMA in New York and the Kimbell in Fort Worth . The Phelans had always mystified the residents of River Oaks . They were vegetarians , the first ones I had ever met . They wore wrinkly hemp garments and Birkenstocks . In a neighborhood where two decorating styles predominated — English Country and Tex - Mediterranean — the Phelans had painted each room of their house a different color , with exotic stripes and swirling designs on the walls . Most fascinating of all , the Phelans were Buddhist , a word I 'd heard even less often than "
2599	2821	2438	2438	sweetie	349	" When I asked Todd what Buddhists did , he said they spent a lot of time contemplating the nature of reality . Todd and his parents had even invited me to go to a Buddhist temple with them , but to my chagrin , my parents said no . I was a Baptist , Mother said , and Baptists did n't spend their time thinking about reality . Todd and I had always been so close that people assumed we were dating . We had n't ever been romantically involved , but the feeling between us was n't strictly platonic either . I 'm not sure either of us could have explained what we were to each other . Todd was probably the most beautiful human being I had ever seen . He was slim and athletic , with refined features and blond hair , and his eyes the opulent blue green of the ocean in Caribbean travel brochures . And there was a feline quality about him that set him apart from the big shouldered swagger of other Texan men I knew . I had asked Todd once if he was gay , and he had said he did n't care if someone was a man or a woman , he was more interested in the person 's inside . "
2827	2843	2844	2844	I	349	" I had asked , and he had laughed at my insistence on a label . "
2850	2901	2846	2846	I	349	" he had said , and pressed a warm , careless kiss on my lips . No one knew me or understood me as well as Todd did . He was my confidant , the person who was always on my side even when he was n't taking my side . "
2912	2927	2908	2908	they	351	" Todd said when I told him that my family was ignoring my boyfriend . "
2933	2934	2908	2908	they	351	" "
2950	2951	2908	2908	they	351	" "
2972	2973	2967	2968	the bride	352	" "
2983	2987	2978	2979	the bride	352	" I said . "
2996	2997	2999	2999	they	351	" "
3032	3033	3034	3034	Todd	0	" "
3036	3042	3034	3034	Todd	0	" I had asked plaintively , "
3056	3057	3054	3054	you	0	" "
3064	3065	3054	3054	you	0	" "
3069	3070	3054	3054	you	0	" "
3089	3090	3081	3081	I	349	" "
3099	3398	3096	3096	you	0	" But Todd had n't answered , and I hung up feeling mystified and annoyed . Unfortunately , Todd 's advice went by the wayside as soon as I started a foxtrot with Dad . My father was flushed from champagne and triumph . He 'd made no secret of wanting this wedding to happen , and the news about my new sister - in - law 's pregnancy was even better . Things were going his way . I was pretty sure he had visions of grandchildren dancing in his head , generations of malleable DNA all at his disposal . Dad was barrel - chested , short - legged , and black - eyed , with hair so thick you could hardly find his scalp beneath . All that and his German chin made him a striking man , if not a handsome one . He had some Comanche blood on his mother 's side , and a bunch of German and Scottish ancestors whose futures had been hamstrung back in their native countries . So they had come to Texas looking for cheap , winterless land that only needed their labor to bring forth prosperity . Instead they got droughts , epidemics , Indian raids , scorpions , and boll weevils the size of their thumbnails . The Travises who had survived were the most purely stubborn people on earth , the kind who relied on their backbones when their wishbones were broken . That accounted for Dad 's stubbornness . . . and for mine too . We were too much alike , Mama had always said , both of us willing to do anything to get our way , both of us eager to hop over a line the other one had drawn . "
3403	3404	3405	3405	Punkin	98	" "
3407	3431	3432	3432	You	356	" He had a gravelly voice , edged with the perpetual impatience of a man who never had to ingratiate himself with anyone . "
3444	3445	3437	3437	You	356	" "
3448	3572	3437	3437	You	356	" Compliments were rare from Dad . I appreciated it , even though I knew my resemblance to my mother was , at best , slight . I was wearing a light green satin sheath , the shoulder straps fastened with two crystal buckles . My feet were strapped in delicate silver sandals with three - inch heels . Liberty had insisted on doing my hair . It had taken her about fifteen minutes to twist and pin the long inky locks up into a deceptively simple updo that I could never hope to reproduce . She was only a little older than I , but her manner had been maternal , gentle , in a way my own mother had seldom been . "
3575	3596	3437	3437	You	356	" Liberty had murmured when she was finished , and picked up a powder brush to dust my nose playfully . "
3599	3639	3640	3640	Nick	285	" It was really hard not to like her . As Dad and I danced , one of the photographers approached . We leaned close and smiled into the blinding white flash , and then resumed our previous distance . "
3650	3708	3640	3640	Nick	285	" I said . We were flying commercial — I had put two first - class tickets on my credit card . Since Dad paid my Visa bill , and went over it personally , I knew he was aware that I 'd bought Nick 's ticket . He had n't said anything about it . Yet . "
3713	3717	3718	3718	Nick	285	" I continued , "
3728	3734	3718	3718	Nick	285	" Looking forward to that . "
3735	3746	3747	3747	I	349	" I 'd like you to be nice to him , "
3750	3773	3747	3747	I	349	" Sometimes I 'm not nice for a reason . It 's a way to find out what someone 's made of . "
3774	3791	3800	3800	Dad	1027	" You do n't need to test Nick . You just need to respect my choices . "
3792	3799	3800	3800	Dad	1027	" He wants to marry you , "
3803	3806	3800	3800	Dad	1027	" Yes . "
3807	3833	3747	3747	I	349	" And then he reckons he 'll have a first - class ticket for life . That 's all you are to him , Haven . "
3834	3840	3841	3841	I	349	" Have you ever thought , "
3844	3860	3841	3841	I	349	" that someone could actually love me for myself , and not for your money ? "
3861	3868	3800	3800	Dad	1027	" He 's not the one . "
3869	3876	3877	3877	I	349	" I get to decide that , "
3881	3885	3877	3877	I	349	" Not you . "
3886	3894	3895	3895	Dad	1027	" You 've made up your mind , "
3914	3923	3924	3924	he	1027	" Then do n't ask for my permission , "
3928	3953	3924	3924	he	1027	" Make your choice and accept the consequences . Your brother sure as hell did n't ask what I thought about him marrying Liberty . "
3954	3979	3924	3924	he	1027	" Of course he did n't . You 've done everything possible to push them together . Everyone knows you 're crazy about her . "
3995	4040	3991	3991	I	349	" Ca n't we just do this the normal way , Dad ? I bring my boyfriend home , you pretend to like him , I go on with my life , and you and I call each other on all the major holidays . "
4052	4068	3991	3991	I	349	" Do n't stand in the way , Dad . Just let me be happy . "
4069	4083	3991	3991	I	349	" You wo n't be happy with him . He 's a nonstarter . "
4084	4103	3991	3991	I	349	" How would you know ? You 've never spent more than an hour in Nick 's company . "
4104	4169	3991	3991	I	349	" I 've been around long enough to know a nonstarter when I see one . I did n't think either of us had raised voices , but we were getting a few curious glances . I realized out mutual haranguing did n't have to be loud for other people to notice . I struggled for calm , and kept my feet moving in a "
4179	4184	4176	4176	God	86	" kind of shuffle . "
4196	4200	4185	4188	Any man I wanted	359	" I said . "
4208	4224	4185	4188	Any man I wanted	359	" I thought there was just enough truth in that to make my father mad . "
4232	4236	4225	4225	I	349	" he said , "
4310	4311	4302	4302	I	349	" "
4316	4328	4329	4329	You	359	" I pulled away from him just as the music ended . "
4335	4365	4329	4329	You	359	" As I left the dance floor , I passed Carrington , who was running to my father with her arms outstretched . She was Liberty 's little sister . "
4369	4586	4329	4329	You	359	" she cried , as if dancing with Churchill Travis were the best thing in the world . When I was nine , I thought bitterly , I 'd felt that way about him too . I pushed my way through crowds of people , and all I could see were mouths and more mouths . . . talking , laughing , eating , drinking , air - kissing . The accumulated noise was mind - numbing . I glanced at a wall clock in the hallway , an antique Ball regulator that had once belonged to the Buffalo Bayou , Brazos , and Colorado Railway . Nine o'clock . In about a half hour , I was supposed to meet Liberty in one of the upstairs bedrooms to help her change into her going - away outfit . I could n't wait to gel through that particular ritual . There was only so much misty - eyed happiness I could take in one evening . The champagne had made me thirsty . I went to the kitchen , filled wall to wall with caterers and their staff , and managed to find a clean tumbler in one of the cabinets . Filling it with water from the sink , I drank in big quenching gulps . "
4590	4772	4588	4588	me	349	" a waiter said urgently , trying to push by me with a steaming chafing dish . I shrank back to let him pass , and wandered into the oval dining room . To my relief , I saw the familiar outline of Nick 's head and shoulders near the dark arched doorway that led to the dine - in wine cellar . He had gone through the small wrought - iron gate and left it ajar . It looked like he was heading into the vault , which was lined with oak barrel stays that sweetened the air . I figured Nick must have gotten tired of the crowds and had come early to meet me . I wanted him to hold me . I needed a moment of peace in the middle of the cacophony . Skirting around the dining table , I went to the wine cellar . The gate closed behind me with a smooth clack . Reaching for the light switch , I flipped it off and went into the cellar . I heard Nick mutter , "
4775	4776	4778	4778	me	349	" "
4780	4801	4778	4778	me	349	" I found him easily in the darkness , giving a low laugh as my palms slid over his shoulders . "
4811	4837	4804	4804	You	362	" He started to say something , but I tugged his head down until my half - open mouth skimmed the edge of his jaw . "
4842	4846	4804	4804	You	362	" I whispered . "
4854	5337	5340	5340	God	86	" His breath caught , and his hands came to my hips as I wobbled a little in my high heels . The wine sweet air filled my nostrils , and something else . . . the scent of male skin , fresh like nutmeg or ginger . . . a sun - warmed spice . Exerting pressure on the back of his neck , I urged his mouth to mine , finding softness and heat , the tang of champagne melting into the intimate taste of him . One of his hands traveled up my spine , coaxing out a shiver , a sweet shock , as the warmth of his palm met my bare skin . I felt the Strength of his hand , and the gentleness , as it closed over my nape and tilted my head back . His mouth barely grazed mine , more a promise of a kiss than an actual one . I made a little sound at the brush of his lips and kept my face upturned , straining for more . Another lush descent , a dizzying pressure as he opened my mouth with his . He reached deeper , his tongue finding ticklish places that drew a shivering laugh from my throat . I tried to curl around him , holding him with my arching body . His mouth was slow and searching , the kisses hard at first , then loosening as if unraveling from their own heat . The pleasure thickened , hard flushes rising through me , bringing the desire to full - slip ripeness . I was n't aware of moving backward , but I felt the frame of the lasting table high against my bottom , the sharp edge digging into my flesh . Nick lifted me with astonishing ease until I sat on the chilled table . He took my mouth again , longer , deeper , while I tried to catch his tongue , tried to draw him as far inside as possible . I wanted to lie back on the table , an offering of aching flesh on sterile marble , and let him do anything he wanted . Something had been cut loose in me . I was saturated with excitement , drunk with it , and part of it was because Nick , who always seemed so in control , was fighting for self - restraint . His breath came in ragged puffs , his hands gripping my body . He kissed my throat , tasting the thin , susceptible skin , his lips stroking the throb of my pulse . Panting , I slid my hands up to his hair , so soft and thick , layers of heavy silk in my palms . Not at all like Nick 's . A cold shot of horror went down to my stomach . "
5342	5409	5410	5410	Nick	285	" I was barely able to force the words out . I touched his face in the darkness , encountering hard , unfamiliar features , the scrape of shaven bristle . The corners of my eyes stung , but I was n't sure whether the imminent tears were caused by embarrassment , anger , fear , disappointment , or some unholy combination of all of them . "
5412	5463	5410	5410	Nick	285	" My wrist was caught in a powerful hand , and his mouth dragged softly over the insides of my fingers . A kiss burned the center of my palm , and then I heard a voice so smoky and deep I would have sworn it belonged to the devil . "
5468	5498	5499	5499	God	86	" CHAPTER TWO The stranger did n’t release me in the scalding darkness , only stroked my back in an effort to loosen the tight chain of my vertebrae . "
5505	5512	5501	5501	I	349	" I said through chattering teeth . "
5522	5527	5501	5501	I	349	" He sounded rueful . "
5539	5564	5532	5532	I	349	" His hand moved up to the bare nape of my neck and squeezed with gentle pressure , relieving the cramp of tiny muscles . "
5572	5573	5566	5566	I	349	" "
5576	5596	5566	5566	I	349	" I clutched at him . He held obligingly still . A smile colored his voice as he asked , "
5603	5604	5566	5566	I	349	" "
5613	5614	5617	5617	boss	349	" "
5619	5640	5617	5617	boss	349	" He eased me down from the table , steadying my balance with his hands . My heart pounded violently . "
5664	5665	5652	5652	I	349	" "
5673	5674	5666	5666	I	349	" "
5697	5698	5694	5694	I	349	" "
5707	5711	5699	5699	You	349	" he observed . "
5753	5754	5737	5737	I	349	" "
5762	5763	5737	5737	I	349	" "
5776	5785	5737	5737	I	349	" He made a quiet sound of amusement . "
5790	5834	5737	5737	I	349	" he said , easing me closer . The proximity of his body was so comforting that I could n't bring myself to push him away . And his voice was soothing enough to stop a herd of stampeding cattle in their tracks . "
5843	5844	5845	5845	You	349	" "
5851	5852	5845	5845	You	349	" "
5868	5930	5862	5862	he	368	" I nodded , even though the idea of Nick kicking this guy 's ass was laughable . Even through the layers of his tux I could feel the contours of a body so hard and powerful it seemed invulnerable . In a flash , I remembered the guy in the reception tent , and my eyes widened in the darkness . "
5933	5934	5862	5862	he	368	" "
5939	5958	5959	5959	I	349	" He 'd bent his head low , and his hot breath stirred the hair at my temple . "
5984	5990	5982	5982	you	349	" He went very still . "
6000	6022	5991	5991	You	349	" A low , ironic laugh escaped him , the sound so delicious that every hair on my body stood up . "
6033	6034	6035	6035	I	349	" "
6039	6098	6035	6035	I	349	" I struggled to catalogue the shame and excitement that stung the inside of my veins . His mouth was so close . I wanted more of those sweltering kisses . I felt terrible about that . But the warm sunny fragrance of him . . . he smelled better than any human being I 'd ever met . "
6101	6106	6035	6035	I	349	" I said unsteadily , "
6120	6121	6118	6118	you	349	" "
6133	6268	6129	6129	I	349	" We were both still and silent , caught in a half - embrace as if every forbidden second had formed a link in a chain around us . The part of my brain that was still functioning urged me to pull away from him with all due haste . And yet I could n't move , paralyzed by the sensation that something extraordinary was happening . Even with all the noise outside the wine cellar , the hundreds of people so close by , I felt as if I were in some faraway place . One of his hands came up to my face , fingertips exploring the curve of my cheek . Blindly I reached up and felt the backs of his fingers , searching for the hard band of a ring . "
6271	6275	6129	6129	I	349	" he murmured , "
6279	6391	6394	6394	you	370	" The tip of his little finger found the outside rim of my ear and traced delicately . I found myself slipping into a strange , pleasant passivity . I ca n't do this , I thought , even as I let him pull me closer , his hand lucking my hips into his . My head felt heavy , tipping back as he nuzzled into the soft space beneath my jaw . I had always thought I was pretty good at resisting temptation . But this was the first time I 'd ever felt the pull of serious lust , and I was n't at all equipped to handle it . "
6401	6407	6409	6412	friend of the bride	373	" I managed to ask , "
6414	6423	6409	6412	friend of the bride	373	" I felt him smile against my skin . "
6434	6435	6427	6427	I	349	" "
6448	6449	6450	6450	Honey	99	" "
6460	6481	6450	6450	Honey	99	" He traced one of the straps that held my dress up , and my stomach gave an excited leap . "
6492	6493	6450	6450	Honey	99	" "
6496	6500	6450	6450	Honey	99	" he said . "
6506	6507	6503	6503	you	370	" "
6515	6523	6508	6508	You	370	" A laugh rustled in his chest . "
6533	6547	6524	6524	I	349	" he admitted . His breath was soft and hot against my hair . "
6586	6587	6588	6588	You	370	" "
6601	6605	6606	6606	Armani	71	" I countered . "
6608	6609	6606	6606	Armani	71	" "
6620	6639	6606	6606	Armani	71	" He braced his hands on either side of me , lightly gripping the edge of the table . "
6645	6660	6606	6606	Armani	71	" I leaned back to preserve the small but crucial distance between our bodies . "
6665	6666	6606	6606	Armani	71	" "
6669	6670	6606	6606	Armani	71	" "
6705	6706	6707	6707	I	349	" "
6723	6741	6719	6719	you	370	" I stared at the outline of his head , now dimly visible in the heavy shadows . "
6765	6766	6719	6719	you	370	" "
6779	6812	6719	6719	you	370	" I could n't resist touching him then , my fingers stealing up to his face , investigating the assertive line of his nose . I touched the crook near the bridge . "
6819	6838	6719	6719	you	370	" I asked in a hushed voice . His warm lips slid over the heel of my hand . "
6859	6860	6845	6845	I	349	" "
6863	6870	6845	6845	I	349	" I pulled my hand away . "
6873	6874	6845	6845	I	349	" "
6888	6898	6880	6880	I	349	" Doggedly I steered the conversation back on course . "
6941	6942	6930	6930	your	370	" "
6945	6949	6930	6930	your	370	" He paused . "
6968	6969	6970	6970	I	349	" "
6977	7021	6970	6970	I	349	" As the double meaning of the words occurred to me , I flushed hard enough I was certain he could see it in the darkness . Mercifully he did n't comment , although I heard the flick of amusement in his voice . "
7027	7028	6970	6970	I	349	" "
7042	7043	7038	7038	You	370	" "
7046	7288	7038	7038	You	370	" But neither of us moved . And then his hands found my hips , skimming upward , a callus on his finger catching at the fragile fabric of my dress . I was aware of every shift of his weight , the subtle movements of bone and heavy muscle . The sound of his breathing was electrifying . The long , work - roughened hands did n't stop until he was cradling my face with a tenderness that made my throat tight . His mouth sought mine , all hot silk and sweetness . But for all the gentleness of the kiss , there was something so raw about it that by the time he drew back , my nerves were pleasure - stung and unbearably alive . A whimper emerged from my throat , the sound embarrassing me , but there was no controlling it . No controlling anything . I reached up to hold on to his heavy wrists , mostly to keep from toppling over . My knees were shot . I had never felt anything so explosive , or insidious . The world had shrunk to this small wine - scented room , two bodies in the darkness , the ache of desire for someone I could never have . He moved his mouth to my ear , and I felt the moist heat of his breath , and I leaned against him in a daze . "
7293	7297	7038	7038	You	370	" he whispered . "
7323	7338	7038	7038	You	370	" His lips slid over my forehead , my nose , my trembling eyelids . "
7400	7424	7425	7425	I	349	" I was amazed . Men never propositioned me like that . And I never would have thought to be so insanely tempted . "
7433	7445	7425	7425	I	349	" His lips caught at mine in a gently biting kiss . "
7453	7472	7475	7476	a boyfriend	383	" I squirmed and pushed back from him until I 'd managed to put some distance between us . "
7478	7483	7475	7476	a boyfriend	383	" I said shakily . "
7508	7509	7504	7504	I	349	" "
7521	7531	7504	7504	I	349	" His footsteps came closer , and I tensed . "
7540	7544	7536	7536	he	384	" he continued , "
7568	7569	7554	7554	I	349	" "
7572	7579	7554	7554	I	349	" I asked , woeful and shamed "
7586	7593	7554	7554	I	349	" A devil - soft whisper . "
7604	7789	7554	7554	I	349	" And he left first , while I leaned against the tasting table with raggedy balance . I went back out into the clamor and stole away to the grand staircase leading to the second - floor bedrooms . Liberty was waiting for me in the room Gage had occupied in childhood . I had barged in there a thousand times , wanting attention from the one person who always seemed to have time for me . I must have been a royal pain , chattering to him while he did his homework , dragging in my broken toys for him to fix . But Gage had tolerated it with what was , in retrospect , remarkable patience . I remembered the time I 'd been about Carrington 's age , maybe a little younger , when Jack and Joe had dropped my favorite doll out the window and Gage had rescued her . I had gone into Jack 's room , a chaos of toys and books and discarded clothes , and I 'd seen him and Joe kneeling by the open window . "
7793	7811	7554	7554	I	349	" I had asked , venturing nearer . The two dark heads turned at the same time . "
7818	7823	7816	7816	Haven	0	" Jack had commanded . "
7835	7836	7824	7824	Daddy	102	" "
7842	7843	7846	7846	you	102	" "
7849	7871	7846	7846	you	102	" I had gone closer , my heart clutching as I saw something in their hands , tied up with strings . "
7881	7882	7879	7879	Bootsie	103	" "
7889	7902	7903	7903	I	349	" Joe had said , his hands busy with string and some kind "
7907	7912	7903	7903	I	349	" You ca n't ! "
7929	7943	7913	7913	I	349	" You did n't ask me . Give her back ! Give her — "
7990	7993	7976	7976	My	349	" Doooooooon't ! "
7994	8000	8001	8001	Jack	0	" For Pete 's sake , "
8009	8018	8001	8001	Jack	0	" She 's just a hunk of plastic . "
8236	8244	8245	8245	I	349	" I love you more than anybody , "
8251	8257	8245	8245	I	349	" I love you too , "
8273	8278	8264	8264	I	349	" More than anybody . "
8377	8380	8381	8381	She	712	" bombshell . "
8420	8448	8410	8410	Liberty	712	" My rescuer . You 'll have to help me out of this dress — it has a thousand buttons and they 're all in the back . "
8449	8453	8454	8454	I	349	" No problem . "
8504	8523	8494	8494	I	349	" I think today was the best day of Gage 's life . You make him really happy . "
8524	8531	8532	8532	Liberty	712	" He makes me happy too , "
8535	8552	8553	8553	She	712	" More than happy . He 's the most incredible man , the most . . . "
8576	8593	8553	8553	She	712	" We 're not the easiest family to marry into . A lot of strong personalities . "
8594	8600	8601	8601	she	712	" I love the Travises , "
8606	8628	8629	8629	I	349	" All of you . I always wanted a big family . It was just Carrington and me after Mama died . "
8696	8703	8704	8704	I	349	" Did your mother get sick ? "
8712	8716	8707	8707	She	712	" Car wreck . "
8811	8814	8815	8815	she	712	" Well , "
8818	8830	8815	8815	she	712	" this is as good as it 's going to get . "
8831	8836	8837	8837	I	349	" You look gorgeous , "
8840	8843	8815	8815	she	712	" Droopy . "
8844	8850	8851	8851	She	712	" In a gorgeous way . "
8861	8870	8871	8871	She	712	" All your lipstick 's gone , Haven . "
8880	8893	8894	8894	She	712	" Nick caught you alone in a corner , did n't he ? "
9280	9296	9297	9297	Dad	1027	" I do n't give a damn if she turns the whole house upside down , "
9300	9306	9297	9297	Dad	1027	" She saved my life . "
9765	9778	9779	9779	I	349	" Was she nice to you when you took ' er places ? "
9792	9822	9789	9789	her	108	" No , honey . She did n't know how to be nice . Anything you did for her , she felt she was entitled and deserved even more . "
9823	9853	9779	9779	I	349	" Well , why 'd you go take care of Mammaw and visit her , after all he 'd done ? I 'd have just let ' er rot . "
9854	9859	9860	9860	Gretchen	108	" Well . . . "
9867	10063	9860	9860	Gretchen	108	" I figured she could n't help the way she was . She was broke when I got her . The past few years had slowed Gretchen down quite a bit . She 'd become a little forgetful , a little querulous . She moved as if her joints were n't banded together as tight as they should have been . There was a new translucent quality to her thinned - out skin , blue veins showing underneath like a diagram sketch that had n't been fully erased . She had come to live with us since Mother had died , which pleased Dad since he wanted to keep an eye on her . Bringing Carrington into the house seemed to have given Gretchen a much - needed jump start . No one could doubt the two of them adored each other . Dressed in pink and purple , her pale golden hair caught in a high ponytail with a huge sparkly bow , Carrington was the picture of nine - year - old haute couture . She was carrying the bridal bouquet , the smaller version that had been made for Liberty to throw . "
10071	10075	10064	10064	I	349	" Carrington announced . "
10086	10093	10064	10064	I	349	" Gretchen came forward , beaming . "
10104	10111	10094	10094	You	446	" she said , hugging Liberty . "
10125	10126	10094	10094	You	446	" "
10135	10139	10140	10140	You	446	" Liberty replied . "
10145	10146	10140	10140	You	446	" "
10156	10160	10153	10154	Aunt Gretchen	108	" I said . "
10164	10165	10153	10154	Aunt Gretchen	108	" "
10171	10176	10166	10166	You	446	" Gretchen told Liberty . "
10183	10184	10166	10166	You	446	" "
10192	10198	10166	10166	You	446	" Liberty said , smiling . "
10211	10215	10199	10199	You	446	" I remarked . "
10222	10254	10199	10199	You	446	" I grinned at Liberty 's wince of embarrassment over the engagement ring she thought was too big . Naturally my brother Jack had compounded her discomfort by nicknaming the diamond the "
10258	10259	10260	10260	You	446	" "
10265	10279	10283	10283	Liberty	712	" Gretchen said decisively , holding out something in a little velvet pouch . "
10299	10483	10291	10291	people	287	" Liberty opened the pouch carefully , and my heart contracted as I saw what it was : the gold charm bracelet Gretchen had worn forever , strung with charms from all the exotic places she had gone in her life . She had promised it to me when I was five years old . I remembered the exact day — she had brought me a junior tool kit complete with a leather belt with loops and pockets . They were real working tools , including a C - clamp , an awl , saw , pliers , level , hammer , eight wrenches , and a set of Phillips - head screwdrivers . As soon as Mother had seen me strapping on the tool belt , she had gone bug - eyed . She had opened her mouth , and before a single syllable came out , I knew she was going to tell Aunt Gretchen to take the gift back . So I clutched a handful of tools and ran to Dad , who was just coming into the family room . "
10491	10492	10486	10487	Aunt Gretchen	108	" "
10500	10525	10526	10526	Gretchen	108	" Dad had said , smiling first at Gretchen , then at my mother . The smile had ossified as he saw her face . "
10528	10534	10526	10526	Gretchen	108	" Mother had said crisply , "
10562	10569	10552	10552	I	349	" My heels had stopped bouncing . "
10577	10578	10570	10570	I	349	" "
10585	10589	10582	10583	your mother	2099	" Dad said . "
10594	10599	10600	10600	They	452	" Gretchen had exclaimed . "
10617	10628	10629	10629	I	349	" Mother 's voice had been full of prickly burrs . "
10662	10697	10653	10653	you	454	" She had stalked from the room , past me and Dad , leaving a chill of silence in her wake . Gretchen had sighed , shaking her head as she looked at Dad . "
10705	10765	10766	10766	I	349	" I had asked . Dad had thrown me an exasperated glance and gone after Mother . I had gone to Gretchen slowly , my hands clenched tight in front of me . She was quiet , but I knew what I had to do . I unstrapped the tool belt and laid it carefully back into the box . "
10777	10782	10768	10768	you	456	" I said glumly . "
10800	10903	10790	10790	She	108	" Gretchen had patted her knee , and I crawled into her lap , snuggling into the scents of powder and hair spray and Rive Gauche perfume . Seeing how intrigued I was by her charm bracelet , she took it off and let me look at it . She 'd bought herself a charm every time she went to a new place . I found a tiny EiffelTower , a pineapple from Hawaii , a Memphis bale of cotton , a matador with a little swirling cape , crossed snow skis from New Hampshire , and too many others to name . "
10906	10911	10912	10912	I	349	" Gretchen had said , "
10930	10931	10923	10923	you	349	" "
10944	10945	10941	10942	Aunt Gretchen	108	" "
10968	10969	10958	10958	they	457	" "
10975	10980	10971	10971	I	349	" I 'd said , "
10987	11122	10971	10971	I	349	" Gretchen had forgotten that promise , I thought . It was n't her fault . She 'd forgotten a lot of things lately . It 's okay , I told myself . Let it go . But I knew the story behind every charm . And it seemed as if Gretchen were taking those handfuls of memories away from me and bestowing them on Liberty . Somehow I forced a smile and held it . My aunt made a show of fastening the bracelet on Liberty 's wrist . Carrington danced around the two of them with excitement , demanding to see the charms . My smile did n't feel like it was part of my face . It hung there like a picture on a wall , suspended by tacks and wires . "
11135	11154	11123	11123	I	349	" I said lightly , picking the veil up from the bed , draping it over my arm . "
11170	11217	11218	11218	Haven	0	" She threw me a quick glance . Despite my cheerful mask , she saw something that caused her to look troubled . When we all left the room , Carrington and Gretchen went first and Liberty stopped me with a light touch on my arm . "
11220	11228	11218	11218	Haven	0	" she whispered , the bracelet jingling , "
11237	11238	11218	11218	Haven	0	" "
11245	11251	11218	11218	Haven	0	" I said at once . "
11266	11414	11261	11261	They	458	" We walked downstairs , while Gretchen and Carrington waited for the elevator . As we got to the bottom step , someone approached in a long , relaxed stride . I looked up and saw a pair of startling blue eyes . A thrill of alarm ran through me as he stopped beside the newel post and leaned against it comfortably . My face turned aspirin - white . It was him , the guy from the wine cellar , Mr. Blue - Collar - in - a - Tux , big and sexy and as cocky as a junkyard dog . He gave me a brief and impersonal glance , his attention focusing immediately on Liberty . To my astonishment , Liberty regarded him with no awe or curiosity whatsoever , only a resigned grin . She stopped and folded her arms across her chest . "
11423	11431	11261	11261	They	458	" A smile touched his wide mouth . "
11440	11474	11261	11261	They	458	" His accent was a little more pronounced than it had been in the wine cellar , melting into the hot - tar drawl you mostly heard in small towns or trailer parks . "
11493	11494	11484	11484	I	349	" "
11509	11515	11516	11516	I	349	" Liberty asked without heat . "
11527	11528	11516	11516	I	349	" "
11549	11556	11547	11547	Hardy	1057	" His smile turned gently mocking . "
11566	11733	11734	11734	Haven	0	" Hardy . I turned my face away and closed my eyes sickly , just for a second . Shit . Just . . . shit . Not only had I kissed someone other than my boyfriend , he also happened to be an enemy of the family . My brother 's worst enemy , who had deliberately ruined a huge biofuel deal that had meant a lot to Gage personally and professionally . From what little I knew , Hardy Cates had once been in love with Liberty , but he 'd left her and broken her heart , and now he 'd come back to make trouble . That kind always did . It was humiliating to realize that he had n't been attracted to me at all , that his proposition in the wine cellar had been designed as another strike against the Travises . Hardy Cates wanted to embarrass the family , and he had no problem using me to do it . "
11736	11740	11734	11734	Haven	0	" Liberty said , "
11764	11765	11766	11767	Miss Travis	116	" "
11769	11869	11766	11767	Miss Travis	116	" he said softly . I braced myself to look at him . His eyes were an astonishing blue - upon - blue in his sun - cured complexion . Although he was expressionless , I noticed the tiny laugh lines that whisked outward from the corners of those eyes . He extended a hand , but I could n't take it . I was actually afraid of what might happen , how I might feel , if I touched him again . Smiling at my hesitation , Hardy spoke to Liberty while his gaze remained locked on mine . "
11883	11884	11881	11881	Liberty	712	" "
11894	11905	11908	11908	ma'am	269	" she began calmly . His gaze moved to her . "
11919	11936	11938	11938	you	269	" Something softened in her face , and she reached out to clasp his hand briefly . "
11940	11948	11938	11938	you	269	" A new voice entered the conversation . "
11953	11981	11982	11983	Mr. Cates	117	" It was my brother Jack , looking relaxed . But there was a glint in his hard black eyes that silently warned of trouble to come . "
12007	12072	11999	11999	I	349	" Hardy gave him a measuring glance . In the silence that followed , I went tense in every muscle , praying silently that a fistfight would n't break out at Gage 's wedding . Glancing at Liberty , I saw she had mined pale . I thought vengefully that Hardy Gates was a selfish bastard , turning up at her wedding like that . "
12076	12083	12084	12084	I	349	" Hardy said with soft insolence . "
12091	12092	12084	12084	I	349	" "
12099	12115	12116	12116	I	349	" Jack said . Liberty and I both let out our breaths as they departed . "
12126	12130	12124	12124	him	467	" Liberty said . "
12141	12155	12134	12134	Jack	0	" Now I understood why she had chosen my brother over that rascal . "
12165	12169	12170	12170	He	269	" I said . "
12179	12180	12181	12181	Hardy	1057	" "
12185	12189	12191	12191	he	269	" Liberty admitted . "
12210	12214	12215	12215	I	349	" She sighed . "
12237	12238	12221	12221	he	269	" "
12256	12257	12249	12249	We	471	" "
12265	12269	12262	12262	he	269	" Liberty said , "
12277	12291	12262	12262	he	269	" Carrington ran up to us , having finally emerged from the elevator . "
12295	12301	12302	12302	Everyone	335	" she said in excitement . "
12314	12383	12384	12384	He	473	" Just what I need , I thought . More fireworks . The next morning I was packing a suitcase in my room when Nick came in . We had occupied separate bedrooms during our stay in River Oaks , which Nick had said was just line because there was no way he was going to touch me when we were under the same roof as my father . "
12396	12404	12384	12384	He	473	" I had told Nick , laughing . "
12421	12422	12384	12384	He	473	" "
12434	12486	12487	12487	I	349	" Nick had said . As soon as Nick came into the room , I knew he had talked to my father . The stress showed on his face . He was hardly the first to come away looking like that after a heart - to - heart with Churchill Travis . "
12491	12495	12496	12496	Dad	1027	" I said . "
12512	12513	12500	12500	He	1027	" "
12516	12524	12545	12545	he	1027	" He gave me a comical look . "
12527	12542	12545	12545	he	1027	" I put my arms around him and laid my head on his chest . "
12548	12552	12545	12545	he	1027	" I whispered . "
12566	12578	12545	12545	he	1027	" Nick eased my head back and looked down at me . "
12623	12624	12625	12625	Travises	106	" "
12629	12703	12625	12625	Travises	106	" I said . A smile entered Nick 's hazel eyes , all green and gold and brown . There was a touch of color on his high cheekbones , a remnant of the confrontation with my bulldog of a father . The smile vanished from his eyes as he smoothed my hair back , his hand curving gently over the back of my skull . He was handsome , grave , concerned . "
12726	12733	12710	12710	Haven	0	" Emotion made my voice unsteady . "
12748	12749	12710	12710	Haven	0	" "
12771	12799	12762	12762	You	474	" He bent his head , his mouth taking mine in a long , slow dream of a kiss . I responded avidly , lifting against him . "
12802	12807	12762	12762	You	474	" he said softly . "
12822	12854	12810	12810	you	474	" CHAPTER THREE Contrary to my expections of elopement as a furtive Elvis - supervised ceremony in Las Vegas , there were hotels in Florida , Hawaii , and Arizona that offered "
12857	12923	12924	12924	He	479	" including the wedding service , the hotel stay , massages , and a meal plan . Gage and Liberty paid for our elopement to the Keys — it was their wedding present to me and Nick . Having taken a stand against my marriage to Nick , Dad went through with his threat to cut me off entirely . No money , no communication . "
12929	12985	12987	12987	he	479	" my brothers told me , but I said emphatically that I did n't want Dad to come around , I 'd had enough of him and his controlling ways for a lifetime . Liberty and I had our first argument when she tried to tell me that Churchill still loved me and always would . "
12990	12996	12987	12987	he	479	" I told her curtly . "
13034	13035	13036	13036	He	479	" "
13040	13044	13036	13036	He	479	" Liberty persisted . "
13047	13048	13050	13050	he	479	" "
13054	13058	13050	13050	he	479	" I said . "
13064	13088	13059	13059	He	479	" It was unfair of me to lash out at her , and I knew it , but I could n't stop myself . "
13095	13100	13106	13106	him	479	" I said recklessly . "
13111	13253	13106	13106	him	479	" It was a long time before Liberty and I spoke again . Nick and I moved to Piano , north of Dallas , where Nick worked as a cost estimator at a construction firm . It was n't something he wanted to do forever , but the pay was good , especially the overtime . I got an entry - level position as a marketing coordinator for the Darlington Hotel , which meant I assisted the director of communications with PR and marketing projects . The Darlington was a sleek , modern hotel , a single elliptical - shaped structure that would have looked phallic enough , except it had also been covered in a skin of pink granite . Maybe that subliminal suggestion was partly responsible for the Darlington having been voted as the most romantic hotel in Dallas . "
13260	13265	13254	13254	You	486	" I told Nick . "
13279	13280	13254	13254	You	486	" "
13288	13638	13281	13281	You	486	" Nick pointed out . I had to admit he was right . I had a weakness for that neon Pegasus , an iconic sign that had perched on top of the MagnoliaBuilding since 1934 . It lent a lot of personality to an otherwise sterile skyline . I was n't sure what to make of Dallas . Compared to Houston , it was squeaky - clean , cosmopolitan , tightly hinged . Fewer cowboy hats , much better manners . And Dallas was a lot more politically consistent than Houston , which had drastic public policy swings from election to election . Dallas , so tasteful and composed , seemed to feel it had something to prove , like a woman who was too concerned about what to wear on the second date . Maybe that had something to do with the fact that unlike most great cities of the world , it had no port . Dallas had become a player in the 1870s when two railroads , the Houston and Texas Central and the Texas and Pacific , both met and crossed at a ninety - degree angle , thereby making the city a big commercial center . Nick 's family all lived in or around Dallas . His parents had divorced and married other people when he was still a kid . Between all the stepsisters and stepbrothers , and half sisters and half brothers , and the full - blood siblings , I had trouble figuring out who belonged to whom . It did n't seem to matter , though , because none of them were close . We bought a small condo with two parking spaces and access to a community pool . I decorated the condo with cheap , brightly colored contemporary furniture , and added some baskets and Mexican ceramics . In our living room , I hung a huge framed reprint of an old travel poster , featuring a dark - haired girl holding a basket of fruit beneath a huge banner reading , VISIT MEXICO : LAND OF SPLENDOR . "
13646	13666	13667	13667	I	349	" I told Nick when he complained that our furniture was crap and he did n't like Southwestern decor . "
13698	13699	13700	13700	We	489	" "
13707	13712	13719	13720	an asshole	494	" Nick replied darkly , "
13722	13789	13719	13720	an asshole	494	" I was taken aback by the flash of animosity , a lightning strike that had come out of nowhere . My pleasure in the condo was an irritant to Nick . I was just playing house , he told me . When I 'd lived like middle - class people for a while , he 'd like to see if I was still so happy . "
13796	13800	13792	13792	I	349	" I said . "
13815	13858	13805	13805	I	349	" It seemed at times that Nick was a lot more affected by my changed circumstances than I was . He resented our small budget for my sake , he said . He hated that we could n't afford a second car . "
13865	13922	13859	13859	I	349	" I said , and that made him angry because if he minded it , so should I. After the storms had passed , however , the peace was all the sweeter . Nick called me at work at least twice a day just to see how things were going . We talked all the time . "
13948	13965	13933	13933	he	349	" My parents always had secrets . You and I should be completely honest and open . "
13999	14005	14006	14006	Nick	285	" You 're so pretty , "
14101	14129	14086	14086	His	349	" Big brown eyes . . . cute little nose . . . beautiful mouth . It does n't matter that you do n't have a body . "
14130	14136	14137	14137	I	349	" I have a body , "
14140	14145	14137	14137	I	349	" I meant boobs . "
14146	14159	14086	14086	His	349	" I have those too . They 're just not big ones . "
14160	14168	14169	14169	I	349	" Well , I love you anyway . "
14475	14487	14488	14488	I	349	" It must be the sight of me in oven mitts , "
14507	14516	14517	14518	The Darlington	2139	" You are ze goddess of ze keetchen . "
14598	14614	14615	14615	Nick	285	" We ca n't afford to take all my shirts to the dry cleaner 's , "
14622	14633	14615	14615	Nick	285	" You 'll have to learn how to do them . "
14634	14637	14638	14638	I	349	" Me ? "
14667	14678	14615	14615	Nick	285	" How come you ca n't do your own shirts ? "
14679	14703	14615	14615	Nick	285	" I need you to help . Is it too much to ask for you to give me a hand with my clothes ? "
14704	14731	14615	14615	Nick	285	" No , of course not . I 'm sorry . I just do n't know how . I 'm afraid I 'll screw them up . "
14732	14743	14744	14744	Nick	285	" I 'll show you how . You 'll learn . "
14753	14767	14744	14744	Nick	285	" You just have to get in touch with your inner Martha Stewart . "
14927	14944	14903	14903	Nick	285	" You need to iron the edges more slowly to get all the little creases out , "
14947	14956	14903	14903	Nick	285	" You need to redo the armhole seams . "
14957	14965	14903	14903	Nick	285	" You need to use less starch . "
14966	14974	14903	14903	Nick	285	" The back 's not smooth enough . "
15036	15042	15043	15043	he	515	" I thought we agreed , "
15047	15058	15043	15043	he	515	" that you were going to learn to do them . "
15059	15066	15067	15067	I	349	" I used my own money . "
15074	15086	15087	15087	He	515	" I 'm ironing deficient . Maybe I need a multivitamin . "
15093	15101	15087	15087	He	515	" You 're not trying hard enough . "
15166	15172	15173	15173	I	349	" I 'll try harder , "
15176	15206	15207	15207	Nick	285	" But sweetheart . . . is there anything else bothering you ? Something we should talk about besides ironing ? You know I 'd do anything for you . "
15214	15230	15207	15207	Nick	285	" All I need is for you to fucking get something right for a change . "
15329	15337	15338	15338	he	1027	" No , it was my fault , "
15367	15376	15377	15377	he	1027	" I 'm asking too much of you , "
15380	15440	15442	15442	he	1027	" You ca n't help the way you were brought up . You were never expected to do things for other people . But in the real world , it 's the small gestures , the little things , that show a guy you love him . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd make more of an effort . "
15640	15652	15653	15654	the stylist	530	" You should never let your hair get longer than this , "
15658	15681	15653	15654	the stylist	530	" The way you had it before was too much for someone as petite as you . It was overwhelming your face . "
15753	15762	15748	15748	Nick	285	" Looks like you 've been busy today . "
15772	15782	15763	15763	His	530	" Do you like it ? It feels great . "
15796	15809	15783	15783	I	349	" It was about time I had a good , healthy trim . "
15810	15824	15763	15763	His	530	" That 's not a trim . Most of your hair is gone . "
15834	15850	15763	15763	His	530	" I was tired of my college look . I think this is more polished . "
15851	15863	15864	15864	I	349	" Your long hair was special . Now it looks ordinary . "
15881	15907	15864	15864	I	349	" I 'm sorry if you do n't like it . But it was too much work . And it 's my hair , anyway . "
15908	15924	15925	15925	My	349	" Well , I 'm the one who has to look at you every day . "
15940	15950	15925	15925	My	349	" The stylist said it was overwhelming my face . "
15951	15970	15971	15971	he	349	" I 'm glad you and she think the world needs to see more of your goddamn face , "
16005	16010	16011	16011	Nick	285	" By the way , "
16015	16033	16011	16011	Nick	285	" just so you wo n't be surprised , I 've told people your name is Marie . "
16065	16068	16043	16043	Marie	1994	" Haven Marie "
16082	16093	16094	16094	I	349	" Why did n't you tell them my first name ? "
16106	16116	16099	16099	Nick	285	" Because it makes you sound like a hick . "
16117	16135	16177	16184	a man who did n't like my name	537	" I like my regular name . I do n't want to be Marie . I want — "
16136	16152	16153	16153	He	536	" Jesus , ca n't I just have a normal wife with a normal name ? "
16287	16290	16291	16291	I	349	" Okay , "
16294	16304	16291	16291	I	349	" So we 'll be Nick and Marie tonight . "
16305	16308	16309	16309	He	536	" Okay . "
16727	16735	16720	16720	he	355	" It would n't do any good , "
16829	16845	16846	16846	Nick	285	" Your dad will have to start doing things for us when we have kids , "
16850	16882	16846	16846	Nick	285	" It would be a public embarrassment for him to have grandchildren living in a damn shack . He 'll have to cough up some money then , the stingy bastard . "
17016	17022	17003	17003	I	349	" It was so weird , "
17035	17142	17003	17003	I	349	" this new one I had last night . I was in a park somewhere , just walking by myself , and my right leg fell off . No blood or anything . It was like I was a Barbie doll . I was so upset , wondering how I was going to get around without that leg , and then my arm broke off at the elbow , and I picked it up and tried to hold it in place , and I was thinking , ' I need this arm , I 've got to find someone to reattach it . ' So then — "
17143	17153	17154	17154	Nick	285	" Did you take your pill yet this morning ? "
17171	17195	17157	17157	I	349	" No , I always take it after breakfast . Why ? Do you think the hormones may be giving me bad dreams ? "
17196	17234	17235	17235	I	349	" No , I think you 're giving yourself bad dreams . And I asked because it 's time for you to go off the pill . We should start having kids while we 're still young . "
17301	17310	17311	17311	I	349	" Do you really think we 're ready ? "
17314	17326	17311	17311	I	349	" It might be better to put away some money first . "
17327	17361	17362	17362	I	349	" We wo n't need to . Your dad will be a lot more reasonable once he finds out Gage and Liberty are n't the only ones who can pop out a kid . "
17547	17555	17556	17556	He	128	" You do n't need these anymore . "
17564	17572	17573	17573	I	349	" I need to finish the cycle , "
17576	17594	17573	17573	I	349	" And usually before you try to get pregnant , you go in to get a checkup — "
17595	17605	17606	17606	He	128	" You 're healthy . You 'll be fine . "
17625	17629	17606	17606	He	128	" Leave them . "
17679	17687	17688	17688	I	349	" Nick , I 'd rather wait . "
17703	17728	17688	17688	I	349	" And this really is n't a good time to talk about having children , with both of us getting ready for work and — "
17729	17740	17745	17745	his	128	" I 'll decide what we talk about and when ! "
17754	17775	17776	17776	I	349	" I did n't realize I had to make a goddamn appointment with you to talk about our personal life ! "
17790	17793	17776	17776	I	349	" Nick — "
17794	17806	17817	17817	his	128	" Do you ever think about anyone or anything besides yourself ? "
17820	17841	17842	17842	He	128	" It 's always about what you want . . . you selfish bitch , what about what I want ? "
17858	17866	17852	17852	I	349	" Nick , I just . . . "
17883	17907	17874	17874	I	349	" I 'm not saying no . I just want . . . would like . . . to talk about it later . "
17918	17977	17874	17874	I	349	" I do n't know . It may not be worth talking about . This whole marriage may not be worth a shit pile . You think you did me some big fucking favor , marrying me ? I was the one who did you a favor . You think anyone else would put up with your crap ? "
17978	17981	17982	17982	Panicky	129	" Nick — "
18473	18481	18482	18482	He	129	" Look what you made me do . "
18748	18751	18752	18752	he	586	" Yes , "
18755	18764	18752	18752	he	586	" I 'll take good care of her . "
18863	18869	18870	18870	I	349	" What did I do ? "
19047	19052	19031	19031	He	349	" Here , sweetheart . "
19124	19134	19135	19135	Nick	285	" I should n't have done that this morning , "
19140	19148	19135	19135	Nick	285	" I thought about you all day . "
19149	19156	19157	19157	I	349	" I thought about you too . "
19182	19199	19200	19200	I	349	" It was just the last straw , seeing what you 'd done to my shirt . "
19214	19225	19200	19200	I	349	" I do n't understand what was wrong with it . "
19226	19253	19260	19260	he	349	" It had about ten times too much starch . I mean , I could have cut a slice of bread with one of those sleeves . "
19263	19305	19260	19260	he	349	" I overreacted . I know that . But like I said , it was the last Straw . So much other stuff has been driving me crazy , and seeing what you 'd done to my shirt was too much . "
19330	19335	19260	19260	he	349	" What other stuff ? "
19336	19368	19369	19369	He	349	" Everything . The way we live . This place is never clean and organized . We never have home - cooked meals . There 's always piles of crap everywhere . "
19387	19437	19369	19369	He	349	" Oh , I know , it looks great right now . And I can see you 've put dinner in the oven . I appreciate that . But it should be like this all the time . And it ca n't be , with both of us working . "
19456	19464	19465	19465	I	349	" I ca n't quit my job , "
19469	19479	19465	19465	I	349	" We ca n't afford to lose my salary . "
19480	19494	19465	19465	I	349	" I 'm about to get a promotion . We 'll be fine . "
19495	19507	19465	19465	I	349	" But . . . what would I do all day ? "
19508	19524	19525	19525	He	349	" Be a wife . Take of the house . And me . And yourself . "
19529	19563	19525	19525	He	349	" And I 'll take care of you . You 're going to get pregnant soon anyway . You 'd have to quit then . So you may as well do it now . "
19564	19572	19465	19465	I	349	" Nick , I do n't think — "
19573	19601	19525	19525	He	349	" We 're both stressed , sweetheart . This would help take the pressure off , for you to handle all the stuff that never gets done . "
19620	19631	19632	19632	he	349	" I 'm sorry about what I did this morning , "
19640	19653	19632	19632	he	349	" I swear it 'll never happen again . No matter what . "
19654	19661	19662	19662	I	349	" You scared me , Nick , "
19665	19671	19662	19662	I	349	" You were n't yourself . "
19672	19684	19689	19689	he	349	" You 're right . You know that 's not me . "
19695	19726	19689	19689	he	349	" No one could love you as much as I do . You 're everything to me . And we 're going to take care of each other , right ? "
19727	19733	19734	19734	My	349	" I do n't know . "
19761	19772	19773	19773	Nick	285	" You can always get another job if you want , "
19777	19796	19773	19773	Nick	285	" But let 's try it this way . I want you to be free for a change . "
19802	19812	19799	19799	myself	349	" Please do n't do it again , Nick . "
19813	19816	19817	19817	he	349	" Never , "
19842	19846	19847	19847	he	349	" Poor baby , "
19850	19870	19847	19847	he	349	" I 'm so glad I did it openhanded , or you 'd have a hell of a bruise . "
20313	20321	20302	20302	he	600	" You need to get over it . "
20322	20327	20302	20302	he	600	" You 're overreacting . "
20328	20335	20336	20338	My own mother	2045	" You take everything too personally . "
20885	20902	20904	20904	she	712	" Haven , I 've got some bad news . It 's about Gretchen . . . "
20981	20987	20988	20988	Liberty	712	" I 'm so sorry , "
21007	21024	21002	21002	her	712	" She was such a wonderful person . I know how much you loved each other . "
21050	21056	21057	21057	I	349	" When is the funeral ? "
21062	21079	21057	21057	I	349	" In two days . Will you come ? Will you stay with Gage and me ? "
21080	21093	21057	21057	I	349	" Yes . Thanks . I . . . How is Dad ? "
21130	21140	21141	21141	Liberty	712	" I guess as well as could be expected . "
21154	21163	21147	21147	She	712	" I 've never seen him cry before . "
21164	21170	21171	21171	I	349	" I have n't either . "
21196	21201	21202	21202	I	349	" How is Carrington ? "
21217	21255	21202	21202	I	349	" You 're so sweet to ask . . . she 's really torn up about it , but she 'll be okay . It 's hard for her to understand how everything can change so suddenly . "
21256	21268	21269	21269	I	349	" It 's hard even for grown - ups to understand . "
21278	21305	21269	21269	I	349	" I do n't know whether I 'll drive or fly down . I 'll call you after I talk to Nick .and figure things out . "
21306	21313	21314	21314	Nick	285	" Okay , Haven . Bye . "
21325	21330	21331	21331	he	349	" What 's up ? "
21341	21347	21348	21348	I	349	" My aunt Gretchen died , "
21403	21434	21395	21395	He	349	" I 'm sorry , baby . I know this is tough for you . But it 's probably a good thing that you ca n't go to the funeral . "
21440	21460	21395	21395	He	349	" I can go . If we do n't have the money for a plane ticket , I can — "
21461	21468	21469	21469	His	349	" We only have one car . "
21473	21492	21469	21469	His	349	" I guess I 'm supposed to sit in the apartment all weekend while you 're in Houston ? "
21493	21502	21395	21395	He	349	" Why do n't you come with me ? "
21503	21523	21524	21524	He	349	" I should have known you 'd forget . We 've got something going on this weekend , Marie . "
21538	21568	21531	21531	I	349	" The company 's annual crawfish boil , at the owner 's house . Since this is my first year , there 's no way I can miss it . "
21573	21598	21531	21531	I	349	" I . . . I . . . you want me to go to a crawfish boil instead of my aunt 's funeral ? "
21599	21658	21531	21531	I	349	" There 's no choice . Jesus , Marie , do you want to cost me any chance of a promotion ? I 'm going to that crawfish boil , and I 'm damn well not going to go alone . I need to have a wife there , and I need yon to make a good impression . "
21659	21664	21665	21665	I	349	" I ca n't , "
21688	21705	21673	21673	I	349	" I need to be with my family . People will understand if you tell them — "
21706	21712	21713	21713	Nick	285	" I 'm your family ! "
21733	21775	21713	21713	Nick	285	" Just who is paying your bills , Marie ? Who 's keeping a roof over your head ? Me . No one in your fucking family is helping us . I 'm the breadwinner . You do what I say . "
21776	21783	21784	21784	I	349	" I 'm not your slave , "
21788	21806	21784	21784	I	349	" I have the right to go to Gretchen 's funeral , and I 'm going to — "
21807	21811	21812	21812	He	349	" Try it . "
21822	21840	21812	21812	He	349	" Try it , Marie . You 've got no money and no way to get there . "
21859	21872	21873	21873	he	349	" God knows how such an idiot managed to graduate from college , "
21876	21897	21873	21873	he	349	" They do n't give a shit about you , Marie . Try to get that through your thick head . "
22060	22064	22066	22066	Liberty	712	" Dear Haven , "
22070	22080	22066	22066	Liberty	712	" I know you were meant to have this . "
22194	22202	22203	22203	Nick	285	" You ca n't take that crap , "
22218	22227	22203	22203	Nick	285	" It might be bad for the baby . "
22316	22326	22307	22307	I	349	" What did the doctor say about getting pregnant ? "
22334	22345	22327	22327	Nick	285	" He said it could take up to a year . "
22372	22390	22327	22327	Nick	285	" Did he tell you when the best days were ? The days you 're most fertile ? "
22391	22397	22327	22327	Nick	285	" Right before I ovulate . "
22398	22419	22327	22327	Nick	285	" Let 's look at the calendar and figure it out . How long into the cycle do you ovulate ? "
22420	22427	22327	22327	Nick	285	" Ten days , I guess . "
22483	22490	22493	22493	myself	349	" I do n't want it , "
22500	22509	22493	22493	myself	349	" You 'll be happy once it happens . "
22510	22523	22524	22524	Nick	285	" I still do n't want it . I 'm not ready . "
22544	22578	22579	22579	I	349	" You 'll never be ready . It 'll never happen unless I push you into it . For God 's sake , Marie , will you grow up and be a woman ? "
22598	22616	22579	22579	I	349	" I am a woman . I do n't have to have a baby to prove that . "
22617	22640	22641	22641	My	349	" You 're a spoiled bitch . A parasite . That 's why your family does n't give a damn about you . "
22646	22654	22655	22655	He	349	" And you 're a selfish jerk ! "
22692	22702	22703	22703	I	349	" You said you 'd never do that again , "
22718	22741	22707	22707	Nick	285	" It 's your fault for driving me nuts . Damn it all , I 'm going to straighten your ass out . "
22779	22782	22766	22766	He	349	" No , "
22791	22794	22783	22783	I	349	" No . "
22965	22971	22972	22972	he	349	" Your period 's started , "
23022	23041	23014	23014	Nick	285	" I 'll finish cooking dinner while you clean yourself up . What do I need to do ? "
23042	23047	23014	23014	Nick	285	" Boil the pasta . "
23048	23052	23014	23014	Nick	285	" How long ? "
23053	23057	23058	23058	I	349	" Twelve minutes . "
23144	23156	23159	23159	Nick	285	" A little less drama , if you do n't mind , "
23409	23423	23391	23391	My	349	" You 've been in there too long . Come out and eat . "
23424	23430	23391	23391	My	349	" I 'm not hungry . "
23431	23440	23441	23441	I	349	" Open the goddamn door and stop sulking . "
23499	23509	23510	23510	he	564	" I 'm not going to apologize this time , "
23513	23531	23510	23510	he	564	" You were asking for it . You know better than to talk to me like that . "
23532	23538	23539	23539	I	349	" If we had children , "
23543	23550	23539	23539	I	349	" you would hit them too . "
23559	23564	23539	23539	I	349	" Shut your mouth . "
23565	23569	23570	23570	I	349	" You would , "
23573	23601	23602	23602	Nick	285	" You would knock them around whenever they did something you did n't like . That 's one of the reasons I do n't want your baby . "
23663	23668	23669	23669	he	564	" Where are they ? "
23702	23707	23708	23708	I	349	" Where are what ? "
23746	23757	23758	23758	He	564	" I have no idea what you 're talking about . "
23782	23791	23772	23772	he	564	" You know exactly what I 'm asking . "
23828	23836	23820	23820	I	349	" I 'm going to get dressed , "
23940	23946	23926	23926	He	564	" Nick , stop it . "
23947	23954	23926	23926	He	564	" Tell me where they are ! "
23955	23968	23969	23969	I	349	" If you 're looking for an excuse to hit me again , "
23972	23980	23969	23969	I	349	" just go ahead and do it . "
24295	24302	24303	24303	he	564	" You stay there till morning , "
24306	24315	24303	24303	he	564	" You think about what you 've done . "
25021	25024	25007	25007	his	817	" Gage ? "
25041	25053	25025	25025	I	349	" Yeah , it 's me . What 's going on ? "
25073	25082	25083	25083	I	349	" I need you to come get me , "
25105	25117	25088	25088	His	817	" What happened , darlin ' ? Are you all right ? "
25118	25121	25130	25130	he	817	" No . "
25134	25141	25130	25130	he	817	" Where are you , Haven ? "
25189	25193	25194	25194	I	349	" Grocery store , "
25201	25205	25194	25194	I	349	" In Dallas ? "
25206	25209	25194	25194	I	349	" Yes . "
25210	25218	25194	25194	I	349	" Haven , are you by yourself ? "
25224	25229	25194	25194	I	349	" Uh - huh . "
25230	25240	25194	25194	I	349	" Can you take a cab to the airport ? "
25241	25244	25245	25245	I	349	" No . "
25250	25258	25245	25245	I	349	" I do n't have my purse . "
25259	25264	25265	25265	Gage	817	" Where are you ? "
25285	25308	25269	25269	I	349	" Okay . I want you to wait near the front entrance . . . is there a place you can sit ? "
25309	25315	25245	25245	I	349	" There 's a bench . "
25316	25356	25269	25269	I	349	" Good girl . Haven , go sit on that bench and do not move . I 'll have someone there as soon as possible . Do n't go anywhere , do you understand ? Sit there and wait . "
25357	25360	25361	25361	I	349	" Gage , "
25364	25373	25361	25361	I	349	" do n't call Nick , ' kay ? "
25392	25407	25387	25387	his	817	" Do n't worry , sweetheart . He 's not coming near you again . "
25562	25566	25554	25554	He	2023	" Miss Travis ? "
25578	25600	25605	25605	he	2023	" I 'm Oliver Mullins . A friend of your brother 's . He called and said you needed a ride . "
25609	25628	25605	25605	he	2023	" But now I 'm wondering if maybe you do n't need to go to the emergency room . "
25636	25652	25629	25629	I	349	" No . No . Do n't want that . Do n't take me there — "
25653	25656	25657	25657	he	2023	" Okay , "
25660	25682	25683	25683	I	349	" Okay , no problem . I 'll take you to the airport . Let me help you to my car . "
25688	25699	25683	25683	I	349	" Promise we 're not going to the emergency room . "
25700	25708	25709	25709	I	349	" I promise . I absolutely promise . "
25715	25723	25724	25724	I	349	" Ca n't get on a plane , "
25735	25744	25724	25724	I	349	" Do n't have my driver 's license . "
25745	25755	25756	25756	His	2023	" It 's a private plane , Miss Travis . "
25763	25781	25782	25782	He	2023	" You wo n't need your license , or a ticket . Come on , let 's — "
25793	25796	25797	25797	he	2023	" Christ , "
25800	25804	25805	25805	I	349	" No hospital , "
25846	25854	25855	25855	he	2023	" I 'd give you the shoes , "
25858	25880	25855	25855	he	2023	" but there 's no way you could keep 'em on . Will you let me carry you to the car ? "
25908	25914	25915	25915	Oliver	136	" That 's all right , "
25918	25927	25928	25928	He	136	" You just take your time , then . "
25957	25967	25941	25941	his	136	" Car 's over there . The white Cadillac . "
25994	26006	26007	26007	he	136	" Would you be more comfortable with the seat back lowered ? "
26089	26092	26093	26093	Oliver	136	" Gage , "
26099	26136	26093	26093	Oliver	136	" Yeah , I got her . Headed to DFW right now . Have to tell you , though . . . he knocked her around pretty good . She 's a little out of it . "
26146	26152	26142	26142	Oliver	136	" I know , man . "
26160	26268	26142	26142	Oliver	136	" Yeah , I think she 's okay to travel , but when she gets there . . . Uh - huh , I think so , definitely . I 'll let you know when she takes off . No problem There was no softer ride than a Cadillac — the closest thing to a mattress on wheels — but every delicate bounce sent fresh aches through my body . I tried to grit my teeth against the pain , only to gasp at the burst of fire in my jaw . I heard Oliver 's voice between the loud throbs of the pulse in my ears . "
26281	26316	26278	26279	Miss Travis	116	" I made a small negative sound . No way was I going to do that — it would hurt too much . A small plastic trash receptacle was settled carefully in my lap . "
26321	26419	26278	26279	Miss Travis	116	" I was silent , my eyes closed , as Oliver maneuvered carefully through the traffic . Lights from passing cars sent a dull red glow through my lids . I was vaguely worried by the difficulty I had in thinking coherently . . . I could n't seem to come up with any idea of what would happen next . Trying to grab hold of a coherent thought was like standing under a big cloud and trying to catch raindrops with a teaspoon . I felt like I would never be in control of anything again . "
26423	26429	26420	26420	You	706	" I heard Oliver say , "
26552	26571	26573	26573	your	714	" I did n't move or speak . But I felt tears leak from beneath my closed eyelids . "
26576	26658	26573	26573	your	714	" Oliver repeated firmly , and drove me the rest of the way in silence . I dozed a little and woke a few minutes later when the car had topped and Oliver was opening the door . The roar of a departing jet tore through the cushioned quiet of the Cadillac , and the smells of fuel and equipment and humid Texas air drifted over me . Blinking and sitting up slowly , I realized we were on the tarmac . "
26665	26737	26738	26739	Miss Travis	116	" Oliver said , reaching for me . I shrank from his outstretched hand and shook my head . Clasping an arm across the place on my ribs where Nick had kicked me , I struggled from the car by myself . When I got to my feet , my head swam and a gray mist covered my eyes . I swayed and Oliver caught my free arm to steady me . "
26741	26759	26760	26761	Miss Travis	116	" he said , continuing to grip my arm even as I tried to shake him off . "
26832	26898	26824	26825	your brother	2049	" I nodded and accepted his hold , even as my instincts screamed to throw him off . The last thing I wanted was to be touched by another man , no matter how apparently trustworthy or friendly . On the other hand , I wanted to be on that plane . I wanted to get the hell out of Dallas , away from Nick . "
26903	26956	26824	26825	your brother	2049	" Oliver murmured , helping me shuffle toward the plane . It was a Lear 31A , a light jet made to accommodate up to six passengers . With four - foot - high winglets and delta fins attached to the tail cone , it looked like a bird poised for flight . "
26960	26964	26824	26825	your brother	2049	" Oliver said , "
26988	27021	26975	26975	Gage	817	" As we ascended the stairs with torturous slowness , Oliver kept up a running monologue as if he were trying to distract me from the agony of my jaw and ribs . "
27058	27059	27049	27049	he	720	" "
27065	27079	27080	27080	Me	349	" I mumbled , wondering if it was someone I 'd met before . "
27082	27125	27080	27080	Me	349	" Oliver smiled and helped me to one of the front seats with great care , and buckled me in . He went to a minibar , wrapped a few pieces of ice in a cloth , and gave it to me . "
27153	27154	27146	27146	you	349	" "
27157	27318	27319	27319	Haven	1994	" I whispered , holding the shifting icy weight of the bag against my jaw . I settled deeper into the seat , gingerly molding the ice bag to the swollen side of my face . The flight was miserable but mercifully short , landing in southeast Houston at HobbyAirport . I was slow to react when the plane stopped on the tarmac , my fingers fumbling over and over with the seat belt fastener . After the Jetway stairs were brought to the plane , the copilot emerged from the cockpit and opened the entrance door . In a matter of seconds , my brother was on the plane . Gage 's eyes were an unusual pale gray , not like fog or ice , but lightning . His black lashes and brows stood out strongly on his worry - bleached face . He froze for a millisecond as he saw me , then swallowed hard and came forward . "
27321	27412	27413	27413	Gage	817	" he said , sounding hoarse . He lowered to his knees and braced his hands on either chair arm , his gaze raking over me . I managed to free myself from the seat belt , and I leaned forward into his familiar smell . His arms closed around me tentatively , unlike his usual firm grip , and I realized he was trying to keep from hurting me . I felt the trembling beneath his stillness . Overwhelmed with relief I laid my good cheek on his shoulder . "
27415	27419	27413	27413	Gage	817	" I whispered . "
27426	27438	27440	27440	you	817	" He had to clear his throat before he could speak . "
27446	27447	27443	27444	baby girl	817	" "
27456	27462	27443	27444	baby girl	817	" He understood at once . "
27484	27498	27479	27479	Dad	1027	" He helped me out to his car , a sleek silver Maybach . "
27505	27521	27522	27522	I	349	" he said sharply as I closed my eyes and leaned back against the headrest . "
27526	27527	27522	27522	I	349	" "
27552	27553	27539	27539	You	817	" "
27560	27564	27565	27565	I	349	" I said . "
27576	27577	27578	27578	You	349	" "
27583	27594	27595	27595	You	349	" Gage said with a savagery that made me flinch . "
27598	27618	27595	27595	You	349	" He broke off and modulated his tone at once as he saw the effect it had on me . "
27659	27668	27650	27650	I	349	" He took a long , uneven breath . "
27686	27687	27653	27653	he	724	" "
27691	27701	27702	27702	They	727	" I said , pulling out of my torpor . "
27711	27740	27741	27741	I	349	" The police would be told , and they might file assault charges against Nick , and I was n't nearly ready to deal with all of that . "
27746	27811	27741	27741	I	349	" Gage said . He would too . He had the power and money to circumvent all the usual processes . Palms would be greased , favors would be exchanged . People would look the other way at precisely the right moment . In Houston the Travis name was a key to open all doors — or close them , if that was preferable . "
27820	27850	27741	27741	I	349	" I tried to sound resolute . But my voice came out blurred and plaintive , and my head throbbed too much for me to keep up an argument . "
27857	27862	27867	27867	he	349	" Gage said quietly . "
27875	27883	27867	27867	he	349	" He let out an explosive sigh . "
27891	28025	27885	27885	you	349	" I shook my head . Sometimes a simple question could have a complicated answer . I was n't really sure how or why it had happened , what it was about Nick or me or both of us together that had resulted in such damage . I wondered if he realized I was gone yet , if he 'd gone out to the front doorstep and found it empty . Or if he was sleeping comfortably in our bed . Gage was silent during the rest of the drive to the HoustonMedicalCenter , the biggest medical district in the world . It consisted of many different hospitals , academic and research institutions . I had no doubt my family had donated new wings or equipment to at least a couple of them . "
28032	28046	27885	27885	you	349	" Gage asked as we pulled up to the emergency room parking lot . "
28049	28057	27885	27885	you	349	" He muttered a few choice words . "
28082	28083	28084	28084	You	728	" "
28091	28096	28084	28084	You	728	" I said thickly . "
28103	28104	28097	28097	I	349	" "
28110	28123	28097	28097	I	349	" Gage looked at me , his eyes filled with anguished fury . "
28157	28163	28154	28155	A monster	730	" His tone was grim . "
28176	28177	28154	28155	A monster	730	" "
28180	28194	28154	28155	A monster	730	" I 'd had enough of angry voices and violence for one night . "
28208	28209	28154	28155	A monster	730	" "
28221	28243	28154	28155	A monster	730	" He got me out of the car , picking me up and carrying me as if I were a child . "
28248	28252	28244	28244	I	349	" I protested . "
28275	28305	28268	28268	Haven	1994	" He carried me to the emergency room waiting area , which was occupied by at least a dozen people , and set me gently beside the reception desk . "
28309	28325	28306	28307	Gage Travis	817	" my brother said , handing a card to the woman behind the glass partition . "
28336	28358	28306	28307	Gage Travis	817	" I saw her eyes widen briefly , and she nodded to the door on the left of the reception desk . "
28374	28375	28367	28368	Mr. Travis	140	" "
28378	28385	28367	28368	Mr. Travis	140	" I whispered to my brother . "
28406	28407	28397	28397	I	349	" "
28415	28460	28397	28397	I	349	" The door opened , and I found myself being pushed and pulled into the pale beige hallway . A wave of anger rushed over me at the manhandling from my brother . I did n't give a shit how well intentioned it was . "
28466	28476	28477	28477	I	349	" I said fiercely , while a nurse approached . "
28493	28494	28483	28483	I	349	" "
28500	28538	28483	28483	I	349	" I was outraged on behalf of the people in the waiting room , all taking their turn while I was whisked right on through . And I was mortified at playing the role of privileged heiress . "
28548	28559	28541	28544	a couple of children	284	" I said , pushing at Gage 's restraining arm . "
28572	28573	28560	28560	They	284	" "
28576	28586	28587	28591	everyone in that waiting room	741	" Gage said in a low , inexorable tone , "
28610	28665	28666	28666	I	349	" With a strength fed on adrenaline , I jerked away from him and bumped against the wall . Pain , too much of it , too fast , came at me from various sources . My mouth watered , my eyes began to stream , and I felt a rising pressure of bile . "
28673	28729	28666	28666	I	349	" I whispered . With miraculous speed , a kidney - shaped plastic bowl was produced as if by sleight of hand , and I bent over it , moaning . Since I had n't eaten dinner , there was n't much to disgorge . I vomited painfully , finishing with a few dry heaves . "
28738	28746	28747	28747	She	743	" I heard Gage tell the nurse . "
28763	28764	28765	28765	We	744	" "
28776	29170	28773	28774	Mr. Travis	140	" The nurse led me to a wheelchair . From that point on , there was nothing to do but surrender to the process . I was X - rayed , run through an MRI , checked for fractures and hematomas , then disinfected and bandaged and medicated . There were long periods of waiting between each procedure . It took most of the night . As it turned out I had a middle rib fracture , but my jaw was only bruised , not broken . I had a slight concussion , but not enough to warrant a stay in the hospital . And I was dosed with enough Vicodin to make an elephant high . I was too annoyed with Gage , and too exhausted , to say much of anything after I 'd been checked out . I slept during the fifteen - minute ride to Gage 's condo at 1800 Main , a Travis - owned building made of glass and steel . It was a mixed - use structure with multimillion - dollar condos at the top and offices and retail space at the base . The distinctive glass segmented - pyramid surmounting the building had earned 1800 Main a semi - iconic status in the city . I had been inside 1800 Main a couple of times to eat at one of the downstairs restaurants , but I had never actually seen Gage 's place . He had always been intensely private . We rode a swift elevator to the eighteenth floor . The condo door was open before we even made it to the end of the hallway . Liberty was standing there in a fuzzy peach - colored robe , her hair in a ponytail . I wished she were n't there , my gorgeous , perfect sister - in - law who 'd made all the right choices , the woman everybody in my family adored . She was one of the last people I would want to see me like this . I felt humiliated and troll - like as I lurched down the hallway toward her . Liberty drew us both into the condo , which was ultramodern and starkly furnished , and closed the door . I saw her stand on her toes to kiss Gage . She turned to me . "
29177	29254	29255	29255	I	349	" I began , and fell silent as she put her arms around me . She was so soft , smelling like scented powder and toothpaste , and her neck was warm and tender . I tried to pull back , but she did n't let go . It had been a long time since I 'd been held this long by an adult woman , not since my mother . It was what I needed . "
29263	29329	29255	29255	I	349	" she murmured . I felt myself relaxing , understanding there was going to be no judgment from Liberty , nothing but kindness . She took me to the guest bedroom and helped me change into a nightshirt , and tucked me in as if I were no older than Carrington . The room was pristine , decorated in shades of pale aqua and gray . "
29337	29771	29334	29334	you	745	" Liberty whispered , and closed the door . I lay there dizzy and dazed . My cramped muscles released their tension , unraveling like braided cord . Somewhere in the condo a baby began to cry and was swiftly quieted . I heard Carrington 's voice , asking where her purple sneakers were . She must have been getting ready for school . A few clanks of dishes and pans . . . breakfast being prepared . They were comforting sounds . Family sounds . And I drifted gratefully to sleep , part of me wishing I would never wake up . After you ’ve been systematically abused , your judgment erodes to the point where it 's nearly impossible to make decisions . Small decisions are as tough as big ones . Even choosing a breakfast cereal seems filled with peril . You are so scared about doing the wrong thing , being blamed and punished for it , you 'd rather have someone else take the responsibility . For me there was no relief in having left Nick . Whether or not I was still with him , I was buried in feelings of worthlessness . He had blamed me for causing the abuse , and his conviction had spread through me like a virus . Maybe I had caused it . Maybe I had deserved it . Another side effect of having lived with Nick was that reality had acquired all the substance and stability of a jellyfish . I questioned myself and my reactions to everything . I did n't know what was true anymore . I could n't tell if any of my feelings about anything were appropriate . After sleeping about twenty - four hours , with Liberty checking on me occasionally , I finally got out of bed . I went to the bathroom and inspected my face in the mirror . I had a black eye , but the swelling had gone down . My jaw was still puffy and weird on one side , and I looked like I 'd been in a car wreck . But I was hungry , which I thought was probably a good thing , and I was definitely feeling more human and less like roadkill . As I shuffled into the main living area , groggy and hurting , I saw Gage sitting at a glass table . Usually he was impeccably dressed , but at that moment he was wearing an old T - shirt and sweatpants , and his eyes were underpinned by dark circles . "
29774	29784	29785	29785	you	746	" I said , going to sit by him , "
29789	29813	29815	29815	he	747	" He did n't smile at my attempt at humor , just watched me with concern . Liberty came in carrying a baby . "
29818	29855	29815	29815	he	747	" she said cheerfully . My nephew , Matthew , was a chubby , adorable one - year - old with a gummy grin , big gray eyes , and a thatch of thick black hair . "
29863	29884	29858	29859	the baby	564	" I asked as Liberty sat beside me with Matthew in her lap . She grinned and nuzzled his head . "
29912	29913	29901	29901	I	349	" "
29927	29982	29918	29919	The family	408	" I wanted to reach for the baby , but I did n't think my cracked rib could take it , even with the support of the elastic rib belt around my midsection . So I settled for playing with his feet , while he giggled and crowed . Liberty looked at me appraisingly . "
30003	30004	29992	29992	you	750	" "
30009	30046	29992	29992	you	750	" I watched as she settled Matthew in a high chair and scattered some Cheerios on the surface . The baby began to rake the cereal bits with his fist , transferring them to his mouth . "
30049	30053	29992	29992	you	750	" Liberty asked . "
30057	30074	29992	29992	you	750	" I usually preferred coffee , but I thought it might be tough on my stomach . "
30080	30102	29992	29992	you	750	" Gage drank his own coffee , set the cup down , and reached over to cover my hand with his . "
30107	30158	30105	30105	you	750	" he asked . As soon as he touched me , a nasty threatened feeling came over me . I could n't stop myself from jerking my hand away . My brother , who had never done violence to a woman , looked at me with open - mouthed amazement . "
30161	30195	30105	30105	you	750	" I said , abashed as I saw his reaction . He tore his gaze away , seeming occupied with a fierce inner struggle , and I saw that his color was high . "
30206	30229	30230	30230	Haven	1994	" he muttered . After Liberty had brought me tea and my prescription pills , Gage cleared his throat and asked gruffly , "
30254	30255	30258	30258	he	751	" "
30289	30334	30335	30335	He	751	" I saw Liberty pause temporarily as she came to pour more coffee for him . I was surprised by how shocked she looked . Gage reached for a glass of water , nearly knocking it over . He took a few deliberate gulps . "
30344	30383	30335	30335	He	751	" he repeated . It was n't a question , more a statement he was trying to make himself believe . I nodded yes and reached over to nudge one of Matthew 's Cheerios more closely within reach . "
30401	30407	30408	30408	I	349	" I heard myself say . "
30437	30438	30439	30439	I	349	" "
30453	30457	30439	30439	I	349	" Gage said . "
30469	30520	30458	30458	I	349	" He continued talking in a measured tone , about how we might need to take photos of my injuries , how to get the divorce over with as quickly as possible , how to minimize my involvement so I would n't have to face Nick or talk to him — "
30523	30538	30539	30539	I	349	" I asked stupidly , while Liberty set a plate in front of me . "
30550	30551	30552	30552	You	349	" "
30582	30603	30604	30604	Gage	817	" I looked at him , so big and decisive and strong - willed , and everything in me rebelled . "
30625	30626	30604	30604	Gage	817	" "
30643	30654	30604	30604	Gage	817	" — Gage paused and glanced at his attentive baby — "
30657	30691	30692	30692	I	349	" I knew my brother was trying to protect me , that he wanted what was best for me . But his protectiveness felt like bullying . And it reminded me of Dad . "
30696	30700	30692	30692	I	349	" I said . "
30715	30716	30717	30717	God	86	" "
30733	30734	30735	30735	I	349	" "
30783	30784	30769	30769	I	349	" "
30798	30806	30807	30807	Gage	817	" Liberty intervened before I could reply . "
30809	30875	30807	30807	Gage	817	" she murmured . Her slim fingers went to the taut surface of his clenched bicep and stroked lightly . His attention was instantly diverted . He looked at her , the lines on his face smoothing out , and he took a deep breath . I had never seen anyone wield that kind of power over my authoritative brother , and I was impressed . "
30881	30886	30887	30887	I	349	" she said gently . "
30930	30963	30964	30964	Haven	1994	" He frowned but did n't argue . They exchanged a private glance . Clearly there would be more discussion later , out of my hearing . He turned back to me . "
30966	30971	30964	30964	Haven	1994	" he said quietly , "
31001	31002	31003	31003	I	349	" "
31017	31021	31007	31007	I	349	" I admitted . "
31031	31032	31007	31007	I	349	" "
31035	31042	31043	31043	I	349	" he asked in genuine bewilderment . "
31048	31067	31043	31043	I	349	" I answered helplessly . Gage rubbed his face with both hands . He stood from the table . "
31090	31097	31083	31083	I	349	" He paused deliberately before adding , "
31100	31134	31137	31137	pardner	144	" Going to the high chair , he lifted Matthew and held him aloft to make him squeal with delight . Lowering the wriggling body , Gage kissed his neck and cuddled him . "
31164	31250	31160	31161	some guy	768	" Settling the baby back in the chair , Gage leaned down to kiss his wife , sliding his hand behind the back of her neck . It was more than a casual kiss , turning harder , longer , until she reached up and stroked his face . Breaking it off , he continued to look into her eyes , and it seemed an entire conversation passed between them . Liberty waited until Gage had gone to take a shower before telling me gently , "
31303	31307	31320	31320	he	766	" I blanched . "
31314	31315	31320	31320	he	766	" "
31360	31361	31362	31362	I	349	" "
31371	31375	31362	31362	I	349	" I said . "
31388	31389	31390	31390	We	772	" "
31395	31411	31390	31390	We	772	" She leaned over and gathered me into another of those long , comfortable hugs . "
31461	31529	31530	31530	Marie	1994	" I felt a wave of affection and gratitude for her . If there was any lingering trace of resentment or jealousy in my heart , it vanished in that moment . Once I started talking , I could n't stop . I told Liberty everything , the way Nick had controlled the household , the shirts I 'd had to iron , the way he called me "
31532	31548	31530	31530	Marie	1994	" Her eyes widened at that last , and she said in a low voice , "
31563	31608	31609	31609	Your	1994	" We had laid out a big quilt with a barnyard design , and Matthew had crawled among the hand - stitched animals until he drifted to sleep on top of a flock of sheep . Liberty opened a bottle of chilled white wine . "
31623	31627	31609	31609	Your	1994	" she warned . "
31630	31639	31609	31609	Your	1994	" I said , holding out my glass . "
31645	31674	31609	31609	Your	1994	" Lounging on the quilt with the sleeping baby , I tried to find a comfortable position on the pile of pillows Liberty had set out for me . "
31679	31691	31696	31696	he	817	" I told her , still pondering my relationship with Nick , "
31754	31755	31740	31740	you	1994	" "
31764	31776	31740	31740	you	1994	" she said with a quiet certainty that got my attention . "
31790	31791	31792	31793	My mother	315	" "
31796	31803	31807	31807	Louis	146	" Her green eyes were distant . "
31871	31890	31863	31863	she	97	" Her gaze wandered over Matthew 's slumbering body , limp and heavy as a sack of flour . "
31929	31965	31966	31966	I	349	" I sipped my wine and considered that for a while . Was Nick 's abusiveness something that could be peeled away like an orange rind ? Or was it marbled all the way through ? "
31980	31985	31966	31966	I	349	" I finally said . "
32014	32029	32030	32030	I	349	" Set - ting aside my empty wine glass , I rubbed my forehead . "
32078	32079	32071	32072	an idiot	2222	" "
32092	32101	32081	32081	he	349	" Liberty said . I smiled without humor . "
32105	32126	32081	32081	he	349	" I realized we were talking about my relationship with Nick as if it were already in the past tense . "
32134	32138	32140	32140	him	349	" I continued , "
32163	32164	32154	32154	my	349	" "
32170	32174	32154	32154	my	349	" Liberty insisted . "
32186	32211	32154	32154	my	349	" The words reminded me of something I 'd heard her say a long time ago on her wedding night . A lifetime ago . "
32221	32230	32154	32154	my	349	" She nodded , her expression turning thoughtful . "
32283	32284	32285	32288	A white knight complex	783	" "
32290	32291	32285	32288	A white knight complex	783	" "
32309	32310	32311	32311	He	1057	" "
32326	32340	32319	32319	he	1057	" I could n't resist pointing out . Liberty 's smile turned rueful . "
32358	32365	32369	32369	Nick	285	" She shook her head dismissively . "
32432	32433	32426	32426	they	791	" "
32438	32443	32444	32444	I	349	" I was indignant . "
32450	32451	32452	32452	You	780	" "
32494	32577	32578	32578	I	349	" Regardless of what I wanted to hear , that got to me . It was a truth I could n't get over , under , or around . . . it stood right in my way , blocking any possible path back to Nick . No matter how much I loved him , or what I did for him , Nick would n't change . The more I tried to please him , the more contempt he would have for me . "
32586	32591	32593	32593	I	349	" I said slowly , "
32595	32602	32603	32603	I	349	" Liberty just shook her head . "
32616	32620	32607	32607	Dad	1027	" I muttered . "
32634	32635	32628	32628	I	349	" "
32638	32643	32628	32628	I	349	" Liberty said earnestly . "
32672	32679	32660	32660	He	1027	" I was n't buying that . "
32689	32693	32680	32680	Dad	1027	" Liberty shrugged . "
32712	32871	32872	32872	I	349	" I was about to tell her it might take a long time to figure that out . But as I lowered myself next to the baby 's warm body and snuggled close , a few things had become very clear . I wanted to never be hit or yelled at again . I wanted to be called by my own name . I wanted my body to belong to me . I wanted all the things that anyone deserved by virtue of being human . Including love . And I knew deep down it was n't love when one person had all the power and the other person was completely dependent . Real love was not possible in a hierarchy . I nuzzled Matthew 's scalp . Nothing in the world smelled as good as a clean baby . How innocent and trusting he was in sleep . How would Nick treat a helpless creature like this ? "
32880	32885	32872	32872	I	349	" I said sleepily . "
32899	32912	32872	32872	I	349	" Liberty draped a throw blanket gently over the two of us . "
32915	32919	32920	32920	You	798	" she whispered . "
32927	33382	32925	32925	Haven	1994	" CHAPTER FIVE In Texas there is an obligatory sixty - day waiting period after you file a petition for divorce . At some point someone in the state legislature had decided that a legally mandated cooling - off period was a good idea for people who wanted a divorce . I 'd rather they had left it up to me to decide whether I needed cooling off or not . Once the decision had been made , I wanted to get it over with quickly . On the other hand , I made pretty good use of those two months . I healed outwardly , the bruises fading , and I started going twice a week to a therapist . Having never been to a therapist before , I expected I was going to have to lie back on a sofa and talk while some impersonal white - coated professional took notes . Instead I was welcomed into a small , cozy office with a sofa upholstered in flowered yellow twill , by a therapist who did n't seem all that much older than me . Her name was Susan Byrnes , and she was dark - haired and bright - eyed and sociable . It was a relief beyond description to unburden myself to her . She was understanding and smart , and as I described things I had felt and gone through , it seemed she had the power to unlock the mysteries of the universe . Susan said Nick 's behavior fit the pattern of someone with narcissistic personality disorder , which was common for abusive husbands . As she told me about the disorder , it felt as if she were describing my life as it had been for the past year . A person with NPD was domineering , blaming , self - absorbed , intolerant of others ' needs . . . and they used rage as a control tactic . They did n't respect anyone else 's boundaries , which meant they felt entitled to bully and criticize until their victims were an absolute mess . Having a personality disorder was different from being crazy , as Susan explained , because unlike a crazy person , a narcissist could control when and where he lost his temper . He 'd never beat up his boss at work , for example , because that would be against his own interests . Instead he would go home and beat up his wife and kick the dog . And he would never feel guilty about it , because he would justify it and make excuses for himself . No one 's pain but his own meant anything to him . "So
33396	33401	33391	33391	he	800	" I asked Susan . "Well
33429	33433	33435	33435	her	285	""Can he ever be fixed?"She
33439	33495	33496	33496	Susan	148	" It 's sad to think about what kind of abuse or neglect might have made him that way . But the end result is that Nick is who he is . Narcissists are notoriously resistant to therapy . Because of their sense of grandiosity , they do n't ever see the need to change . "
33508	33535	33496	33496	Susan	148	" Believe me , no therapist wants a narcissist to walk in the door . It only results in massive frustration and a waste of time . ""What
33539	33545	33547	33547	I	349	" I brought myself to ask "
33551	33574	33576	33576	you	803	" At that point my eyes stung and I had to blow my nose , so Susan had to repeat her answer . "Of
33592	33763	33587	33587	We	804	"At first I was afraid I was going to have to work on forgiving Nick . It was an indescribable relief to hear Susan say no , I did n't need to stay trapped in the cycle of abuse and forgiveness . Victims of abuse were often burdened with the so - called responsibility of forgiving , even rehabilitating , their tormentors . That was n't my job , Susan said . Later we could find some level of resolution so the poison of my relationship with Nick would n't spill into other areas of my life . But right now there were other things to concentrate on . I discovered I was a person with weak boundaries . I had been taught by my parents , especially my mother , that being a good daughter meant having no boundaries at all . I had been raised to let Mother criticize and have her way all the time , and make decisions for me that she had no business making . "But
33776	33781	33782	33782	They	1993	" I told Susan . "

33815	33848	33811	33811	Susan	148	" My own parents insist that I 'm the one who should take care of them in their old age , but they would never think of demanding that from my brother . "Susan

The interior was trendy , unromantic , and crowded , with dark paneling and low lighting . I liked Jack 's girlfriend Heidi , who was bubbly and giggly . It was one of those winter evenings when the Houston weather could n't make up its mind about what it wanted to do . It rained on and off for a while , a few sideways gusts hitting us beneath the shelter of an umbrella as Jack guided us inside . I gathered Jack was a regular at this place — he appeared to know the bouncer , two of the bartenders , a couple of waitresses , and pretty much everyone who passed by our small table . In fact , Heidi seemed to know everyone too . I was introduced to a steady parade of overworked Houstonites who were all desperate for their first Friday - evening cocktails . A couple of times Heidi nudged me under the table when a nice - looking guy had stopped by . "

40286	40377	40282	40282	my	349	" I said , raising my drink . After slowly drinking one and a half vodka martinis , I was ready to go home . The bar was getting more crowded , and the groups of bodies moving by our table reminded me of upstreaming salmon . I looked at Jack and Heidi , who appeared in no hurry to go anywhere , and I felt the kind of loneliness that can happen in a roomful of people when everyone but you seems to be in on the good time . "Hey
40389	40393	40394	40394	Jack	0	""You ca n't , "

40661	40735	40737	40737	I	349	" That would put it on the level of a disorder , and I 'm not convinced the problem is that deep - seated . What happens is , after an experience like you had with Nick , your unconscious mind says ' I 'll attach feelings of aversion and anxiety to the opposite sex , so I 'll avoid ever being hurt again . ' It 's just a matter of rewiring . ""Well

41456	41532	41533	41533	I	349	"There was no change in his expression except for a slight widening of those blue - on - blue eyes . He picked up his drink and tossed back a swallow . When his gaze returned to mine , he seemed to be looking right inside me . I flushed hard , remembering the wine cellar again . The blonde was still giving me the evil eye . I gestured to her awkwardly and babbled , "

41580	41601	41575	41575	We	963	" He glanced over his shoulder , the yellow bar light sliding over the layers of his shiny dark hair . "

41714	41719	41720	41720	Hardy	1057	"Give it a minute , "
41723	41730	41731	41731	He	1057	" It 'll thin out soon . "
41743	41746	41731	41731	He	1057	"Yes , Mr. Cates?"Hardy
41755	41759	41731	41731	He	1057	" What 'll you have?"I've
41777	41783	41765	41765	I	349	" Dr Pepper , please . ""Dr
41789	41800	41765	41765	I	349	" he told the bartender . Surprised , I asked , "
41809	41830	41805	41805	I	349	" His mouth curved with a slow burn of a smile . For a moment I forgot how to breathe . "
41841	42101	41805	41805	I	349	"He was too big . Too close . I still had n't rid myself of the habit of assessing a man in terms of how much damage he could do to me . Nick had left bruises and fractures — but this guy could kill a normal person with a swipe of his hand . I knew that someone like me , with all my baggage and my possible case of sexophobia had no business being around Hardy Cates . His hands were still on either side of me , braced on the chair arm and the countertop . I felt the tension of opposing urges , the desire to shrink away from him , and an attraction that prickled like sparks in - side me . His silver - gray tie had been loosened and the top button of his shirt was unfastened , revealing the hint of a white undershirt beneath . The skin of his throat was smooth and brown . I wondered for a second what his body felt like beneath the layers of thin cotton and broadcloth , if he was as hard as I remembered . A tumult of curiosity and dread caused me to fidget on the chair . I turned gratefully as the bartender brought my drink , a highball of sparkling Dr Pepper . Bright red cherries bobbed on the surface . I plucked one from the drink and pulled the fruit from its stem with my teeth . It was plump and sticky , rolling sweetly on my tongue . "Did
42110	42166	42171	42171	Jack	0	" Hardy asked . So many men his size had incongruously high voices , but he had a deep voice , made to fill a big chest . I considered telling him to call me by my first name , but I needed to keep every possible barrier between us , no matter how slight . "I
42176	42180	42171	42171	Jack	0	" I said . "
42201	42227	42194	42194	We	969	" I picked out another cherry and ate it slowly , and found that Hardy was watching me with an absorbed , slightly glazed expression . "When
42240	42244	42228	42228	I	349	" I said . "
42268	42280	42254	42254	I	349	""I bet you were a cute little girl . A tomboy . ""Absolutely
42284	42288	42289	42289	I	349	" I said . "

42321	42335	42336	42336	I	349	" Lots of dolls . Ballet outfits . An Easy - Bake Oven . "
42348	42378	42345	42346	Dr Pepper	81	" My aunt finally gave me a junior tool kit , but I had to give it back . My mother said it was n't appropriate for little girls . "The
42385	42394	42381	42381	his	81	" I never got what I wanted either . "I
42425	42433	42434	42434	I	349	" How 's your EOR business going ? "
42485	42489	42490	42491	A man	2023	" bypassed pay . "

42510	42554	42555	42555	He	1057	" We 've bought up leases for some mature fields , and got some good results with CO , flooding . And we bought an interest in a nonoperated property in the Gulf — we 're getting some good play out of it . "
42564	42570	42571	42571	he	1057	" You cut your hair , "
42588	42595	42575	42575	I	349	" It was in the way . ""It

42659	42664	42651	42651	I	349	" I said hastily . "
42667	42723	42651	42651	I	349	"Hardy fell obligingly silent . My gaze focused on the hand resting on the countertop . It was long - fingered and capable , a workman 's hand . His nails were clipped nearly to the quick . I was struck by the scattering of tiny star - shaped scars across some of his fingers . "
42734	42744	42651	42651	I	349	" I asked . His hand flexed a little . "
42769	42783	42784	42784	You	977	"I winced at the thought of the wicked barbs digging into his fingers . "

42945	42950	42933	42933	I	349	"Thanks for the drink . "
42956	42979	42933	42933	I	349	" I have to go , I 'm . . . It was nice to see you . Good luck with everything . "
43006	43013	43014	43014	Hardy	1057	"I'll walk you to your car , "
43034	43044	43045	43045	he	1057	"No , thanks , I 'll get a taxi . "But
43051	43059	43060	43060	I	349	"You'll lose your place at the bar , "
43063	43072	43073	43073	I	349	"There 's always another place at the bar . "

43119	43124	43109	43109	he	1057	" I said abruptly . "

43172	43178	43166	43166	I	349	" A taxi 's fine . "Hardy

43351	43359	43360	43360	I	349	" It was the marriage that sucked . "

43855	43867	43825	43825	I	349	"Hardy grinned unrepentantly , his teeth white in his tanned face . "

44679	44721	44657	44657	I	349	" I went on to tell him all about Hardy Cates , even going so far as to describe what had happened at Liberty and Gage 's wedding almost two years ago , and then about meeting him in the bar . "
44736	44740	44723	44723	I	349	" I concluded . "
44770	44776	44723	44723	I	349	I?""Depends . What movie did you watch?""Todd
44778	44789	44723	44723	I	349	" I protested , wanting a serious answer from him . "Haven
44830	45090	44809	44810	My father	89	"I had always liked Todd 's father , Tim Phelan , but I 'd never understood his art . The best explanation I 'd heard was that Tim Phelan was a revolutionary genius whose sculptures exploded conventional notions of art and displayed common materials like bubble gum and masking tape in a new context . As a child I had often wondered at the perplexing role reversal of the Phelan household , in which the parents seemed like children , and their only child , Todd , had been the grown - up . It had only been at Todd 's insistence that the family kept standard hours for eating and sleeping . He had dragged them to parent / teacher conferences even though they did n't believe in the grading system . Todd had no luck , however , in curbing their wild house decorating . Sometimes Mr. Phelan would pass through the hallway , pause to sketch or paint something right on the wall , and continue on his way . Their house had been filled with priceless graffiti . And at holiday time , Mrs. Phelan would hang the Christmas tree , which they called a bodhi bush , upside down from the ceiling . Now Todd had become an enormously successful interior designer , mostly because of his ability to be creative without going too far . His father disdained his work , which pleased Todd tremendously . In the Phelan family , Todd had once told me , beige was an act of defiance . "So
45092	45104	44809	44810	My father	89	" Todd said , returning to the subject of the jacket . "
45111	45114	45106	45106	I	349	it?"I grinned . "
45149	45191	44809	44810	My father	89	""I think you need to talk with Susan this week about why you 're so afraid of a guy you 're attracted to that you ca n't handle anything more than fondling his jacket . While he 's not in it . "I
45196	45210	44809	44810	My father	89	" I already told you , he 's a family enemy and I — "
45211	45216	45217	45217	Todd	0	" I call bullshit , "
45220	45242	45217	45217	Todd	0	" You did n't have any problem telling your family to go to hell when you wanted to be with Nick . ""Yeah
45257	45294	45250	45250	they	1022	""Doesn't matter . You have the right to go after any guy who appeals to you . I do n't think you 're afraid of your family 's reaction . I think it 's something else . "
45307	45315	45303	45303	he	0	" Was it that bad with Nick , sweetheart?"I
45380	45382	45383	45383	I	349	"Yeah , "
45399	45405	45392	45392	I	349	" It was pretty bad . "Then
45423	45429	45430	45430	he	0	" What can I do ? "
45434	45444	45430	45430	he	0	"You're doing it , you 're being my friend . ""Always
45446	45750	45751	45751	You	1025	"I knew he meant it . And it occurred to me that friendship was a lot more dependable , not to mention long - lasting , than love . CHAPTER SEVENWhen an apartment at 1800 Main became available , it never lasted long despite the multimillion - dollar price tag . No matter whether your place was a thousand square feet — the size of my manager 's apartment , which I loved for its coziness — or four thousand square feet , you got the best views in Houston . You also had the benefits of twenty - four - hour concierge and valet service , designer kitchens loaded with granite and quartz , Murano glass light fixtures , bathrooms with travertine floors and Roman soaking tubs , closets you could park a car in , and membership to a sixth - floor club featuring an Olympic - sized pool , a fitness center , and your own personal trainer . Regardless of all those amenities , Gage and Liberty had moved out . Liberty was not much on high - rise living , and she and Gage had both agreed that Matthew and Carrington needed to live in a house with a yard . They had a ranch north of Houston , but it was too far from the city and Gage 's offices to be their main residence . So they had found a lot in the Tanglewood subdivision and had built a European - style home there . Once the apartment was empty , our leasing agent , Samantha , began to show it to prospective buyers . But before anyone was able to see a place in 1800 Main , Samantha had to get a reference from a bank or law firm to make sure they were legit . "
45756	45761	45751	45751	You	1025	" she told me , "
45774	45809	45751	45751	You	1025	" She also revealed that about a third of our residents had paid cash for their apartments , at least half were business executives , and almost three quarters of them were what Samantha considered "
45812	45845	45846	45846	Haven	1994	" people . About a week after I had messengered Hardy 's dry - cleaned jacket to his office , I got a call from Samantha . She sounded tense and distracted . "
45878	45893	45867	45867	he	1027	""Oh , I 'm so sorry to hear that . Is there anything I can do?""Yes
45895	45901	45903	45903	you	1030	" She gave a groan . "
45936	45940	45941	45941	I	349	""Vanessa 's gone , "
45945	45954	45941	45941	I	349	" She took a long weekend , remember ? "
46144	46151	46152	46152	I	349	"Is there anything else , Sam ? "
46155	46196	46199	46199	he	1034	"I would really appreciate it if you could go to my computer and print out the latest marketing plan file for Mr. Travis — he was coming by today , and he really needs to take a look at it . ""I'll

46437	46472	46473	46473	Samantha	158	"The connection terminated , and I put down the phone . I went to Samantha 's computer and pulled up her schedule , just as the concierge , David , beeped on the intercom . "
46483	46516	46473	46473	Samantha	158	"As my suspicion was confirmed , I found myself out of breath . I was simultaneously stunned , worried , and oddly amused . My voice sounded strange to my own ears . "
46523	46528	46517	46517	Samantha	158	" I told David . "

47456	47469	47470	47470	I	349	" Eighteen hundred Main is n't that much better than Post Oak , "
47473	47495	47470	47470	I	349	" In fact , in terms of bang for the buck , you 're probably better off staying where you are . "Hardy
47503	47515	47470	47470	I	349	" Are you trying out some new kind of sales tactic on me?""No
47526	47530	47470	47470	I	349	""What 's your best guess?"I
47538	47557	47470	47470	I	349	" I think you 've got some leftover hang - up about my sister - in - law . "Hardy
47562	47595	47596	47596	He	1057	" You 're way off on that one , honey . We never even slept together . I wish Liberty all the best , but I do n't want her that way . "
47634	47640	47641	47641	he	1057	" So take another guess , "
47644	47666	47641	47641	he	1057	" You ca n't keep me out of here if you ca n't come up with a good reason for it . "I

47689	47697	47700	47700	his	1057	" That 's a pretty good reason . "The
47704	47717	47700	47700	his	1057	" I got all that out of my system in my twenties . ""You

47893	47895	47896	47896	I	349	"Sorry , "
47908	47938	47896	47896	I	349	"I pushed the wrong buttons . When that happens , It takes a few seconds to clear and reset . You can change the combination to any number you — "
47939	47942	47943	47943	he	1068	" Haven , "

47997	48020	47991	47991	I	349	" His voice was soft , reaching inside me to a raw , tender place . A mocking smile touched his lips . "
48031	48124	48023	48023	I	349	you?"I could n't answer . I ca n't stand this , I thought desperately . Heat washed over me , color layering on color . My heart worked in painful beats . All I could do was stare at Hardy without blinking , my back pressing against the door while he bent over me . He moved closer , imparting the pressure of his body until I felt the touch of hard muscle in several places at once . I closed my eyes , mortified by the rapid gusts of my breathing . "Then
48132	48136	48023	48023	I	349	" Hardy murmured , "
48143	48411	48413	48413	me	349	"His dark head bent . He eased his mouth over mine . I put my fists between us , my arms clasped over my chest in a tight blockade . I could n't make myself push him away , but neither could I let him hold me full - on . His arms went around me , the embrace firm but gentle , as if he were being mindful not to crush me . Our breath mingled , heat surging in restless rhythms . His mouth shifted , catching at my top lip , then the lower one , opening them . Every time I thought the kiss might stop , it went on longer , deeper , and the back of my throat tingled as if I were being fed something sweet . I felt the silken stroke of his tongue . . . a soft taste . . . another . . . I went weak against him , dissolving in sensation . His tenderness disarmed me until I almost forgot about the knot of fear in my stomach . I stood there breathing him , feeling him . . . but he was all around me , he could overpower me so easily if he chose . I could n't handle feeling that defenseless , no matter how gentle he was . Turning my mouth away from his , I broke the kiss with a whimper . Hardy 's lips grazed the top of my head , and he released me slowly . He looked down at me , blue heat in his eyes . "Now
48417	48623	48624	48624	Liberty	712	" he whispered . Purely by luck — I could n't yet pull a coherent thought from my brain — I managed to dial the right combination and open the door . Since I was n't certain how far I could walk without staggering , I let Hardy do his own exploring . He wandered through the three - bedroom apartment , checking out the finishes , the appliances , the views from every room . In the main living area , a wall of nothing but windows revealed a spectacular view of Houston , the unzoned city sprawling outward in a mix of offices and strip malls and mansions and shacks , the cheap and the great mingling freely . Watching Hardy 's long , lean form silhouetted against those windows , I thought the apartment suited him . He wanted to show people he 'd arrived . And you could n't blame him for that . In Houston , if you wanted a place at the table , you had to have the clothes , the cars , the high - rise apartment , the mansion . The tall blond wife . Needing to break the silence , I finally found my voice . "
48636	48648	48624	48624	Liberty	712	" I leaned against the kitchen counter as I watched him . "
48652	48660	48661	48661	Welder	174	do?"He glanced at me over his shoulder . "
48663	48683	48661	48661	Welder	174	"No wonder , I thought , and I did n't realize I 'd said it aloud until he replied . "No
48685	48694	48695	48695	I	349	what?""Your . . . your shoulders and arms , "
48700	48702	48703	48703	He	349	"Oh . "
48717	48778	48703	48703	He	349	" Yeah , they usually get the bigger guys to do the onboard welding , the stuff they ca n't do in shore - based shops . So I had to carry a seventy - pound power - con all around the rig , up and down stairs and ladders . . . that whips you into shape real fast . ""A
48786	48789	48703	48703	He	349	generator?"He nodded . "
48840	48859	48831	48831	my	349	" He grinned and rubbed the back of his neck , as if recalling long - ago discomforts . "
48875	48882	48883	48883	I	349	""I honestly ca n't imagine that , "
48905	48913	48890	48890	he	349	"Did you like being a rig welder ? "
48918	48928	48914	48914	I	349	" I mean , was it what you wanted to do?""I
48941	48948	48914	48914	I	349	""That 's the town you grew up in?"He
48951	49029	49030	49030	you	1076	" Blew out one of my knees playing football — so no chance of a scholarship . And in Welcome , if you do n't make it to college , your options are limited . I knew how to weld , from my fence work . It did n't take much to get certified . And I had a buddy who worked as a rig roustabout he told me the welders made - eighty bucks an hour . ""Did
49043	49055	49030	49030	you	1076	" I gestured at the gleaming , pristine apartment around us . "No
49057	49063	49030	49030	you	1076	" Hardy said at once . "
49069	49106	49067	49067	I	349	" But as he stared into my eyes , he paused . It seemed as if he were weighing the consequences of his words , wondering how I 'd react if he told me the truth . "
49112	49121	49109	49109	I	349	" he finally said , his voice soft . "
49198	49229	49192	49192	I	349	"As I began to comprehend what a tremendous drive he possessed , I was surprised by the hint of something like shame or defensiveness secreted deep in the quiet admission . "
49240	49269	49270	49270	I	349	ambitious?"He gave me an arrested glance , as if it were a question he 'd never been asked before . A wary pause , and then he said , "
49287	49295	49280	49280	Folks	1080	""Why?""It 's like crabs in a box . "
49303	49342	49300	49300	he	349	" You can keep a bunch of crabs in a shallow container , and none of them will escape . Because as soon as one of 'em tries to climb out , the others pull him back in . "We
49386	49393	49396	49396	him	349	"What did you do in Dallas ? "
49399	49419	49396	49396	him	349	"I worked at a hotel for a little while . Then I stayed at home for about a year . "Hardy
49427	49434	49435	49435	I	349	" Doing what ? Being a trophy wife?"Since
49451	49459	49447	49447	I	349	" Yes . It was pretty boring . ""Is
49468	49472	49474	49474	his	349	bored?""More or less . "
49483	49492	49477	49477	I	349	" You think I 'm spoiled , do n't you?"He
49500	49519	49477	49477	I	349	" I think you should have married someone who could have done a better job keeping you entertained . ""I
49528	49532	49533	49533	I	349	" I said . "
49541	49555	49556	49556	I	349	""You never know . You may want to give it another try someday . "
49561	49573	49556	49556	I	349	" No man will ever have that power over me again . "The
49583	49600	49580	49580	his	349	" You had all the power , sweetheart . You 're a rich man 's daughter . "Of
49628	49636	49637	49637	I	349	"The entire subject of marriage is boring , "
49640	49656	49637	49637	I	349	" Especially mine . And I 'd rather you not call me ' sweetheart . ' "
49672	49679	49637	49637	I	349	" What do you think about the apartment?""I
49683	49694	49698	49702	a family of five living	2009	""A lot of space for a single guy , is n't it?""I
49720	49733	49712	49712	I	349	"I tried to remember what Liberty had told me about his family . "
49742	49743	49712	49712	I	349	" "

49879	49957	49960	49960	you	1089	" I know what it 's like to lose someone that way . My mother died of breast cancer too . Except she never went through the chemo . They caught it too late . She was at stage four with lung dissemination . Mother chose to have a shorter , better quality of life , as opposed to dragging it out and going through all the surgery and treatments , which would n't have worked anyway . ""How
49962	49967	49960	49960	you	1089	" he asked gently . "Fifteen

50060	50073	50074	50074	I	349	" I said , a little too quickly . He smiled lazily . "

50131	50231	50100	50100	I	349	""Why?"He was good at throwing me off balance . I could feel my pulse kicking up with agitation . I did n't know what it was about Hardy that broke through my defenses . Damn , he was wily . Aggressive , pushy , but smart enough to cover it with easy charm . He was ten times the man Nick was , and he was just too much , too much in every way . If I ever let him close to me , I would deserve whatever I got , and the results would n't be pretty . "Look
50233	50238	50100	50100	I	349	" I said sharply , "
50264	50280	50100	50100	I	349	"His gaze did n't move from mine . His eyes were darker than a blueprint . "

50348	50366	50340	50340	I	349	""Understood . So where do I end up , Haven ? . . . Here , or Post Oak?"I
50379	50392	50394	50394	I	349	" Move here if you want . It 's a free country . ""Okay

50592	50622	50544	50544	I	349	" I guess there 's some sense in that . But why does he want to live here ? If this is some whack deal about Gage and Liberty — "
50623	50648	50654	50654	my	349	" No , I honestly do n't think that 's it . I think he would have taken another apartment if it were available . "Jack

We talked some hunting and fishing , and he struck me as a good ol' boy . And like him or not , you 've got to hand it to him — that company of his is kicking ass . ""Why
50815	50888	50889	50889	Jack	0	is?""He 's pulled together a great team , and he can negotiate a tight deal . But mostly he 's got the knack for finding oil .

57896	57900	57901	57901	Hardy	1057	" A few . "
57909	57928	57901	57901	Hardy	1057	" I 've learned a little here and there . Never got the retro - olfaction , though . ""It
57955	57989	57949	57949	your	1200	" As Hardy moved closer , I completely forgot what I was saying . My gaze went to the tanned skin of his throat , the damp hollow at the base of it . "So
57993	57997	57998	57998	I	349	" I said , "
58013	58041	58004	58004	I	349	" The idea of him naked , with hot water running over all that hard flesh , all that compressed energy , frayed my composure even further . "You

58135	58143	58116	58116	he	1057	" Do you get far with lines like that?"He

58210	58226	58227	58227	He	1057	"His expression cleared , as if my answer confirmed something he 'd been wondering about . "
58233	58288	58227	58227	He	1057	""Well , no . Todd 's sort of ' anything goes . ' He 's had relationships with men and women . He 's open to any possibility , because to him the outside of a person is just packaging . It 's a pretty enlightened point of view when you think about it . ""I'm
58292	58297	58298	58298	I	349	" Hardy said flatly . "
58308	58338	58339	58339	Haven	1994	" And his gaze dipped briefly to my chest with an interest I found somewhat unwarranted , considering my lack of volume . He looked back into my eyes . "
58360	58364	58354	58354	they	1203	" The Harrisburg ? "
58408	58417	58419	58420	my partners	1117	" I 'm going to that with Todd . ""One
58438	58484	58431	58431	I	349	"I got the impression that Hardy had been about to ask me to go with him . Like on a date . I felt hot and suffocated at the thought . I was not ready for a date with anyone , least of all him . "
58493	58500	58431	58431	I	349	" I tried to sound breezy . "
58518	58521	58431	58431	I	349	""You too . ""Okay
58527	58544	58431	58431	I	349	" I turned and fumbled at the doorknob . He reached around me and grasped it . "
58552	58570	58431	58431	I	349	"I waited with panicked impatience , ready to flee . But Hardy paused before opening the door . "Haven
58572	58787	58431	58431	I	349	" He waited until I turned toward him , the front of my body aligned with his , not quite touching . The awareness between us was so intense that I could almost feel the pressure of him against my skin , the hardness and weight of him . I could n't keep from wondering what sex would be like with him , if he would crush and hurt , if he would be gentle . And then I wondered if he had ever hit a woman . Somehow I could n't imagine it , those powerful hands inflicting damage on someone more vulnerable than himself , rupturing vessels , leaving bruises . But Nick had taught me that unimaginable things were possible . When I did gather the courage to try again , it would not be with some excessively masculine creature . But maybe that was part of the attraction , knowing deep down that real feelings , real attachment , could never happen with Hardy . I looked up into his eyes , mesmerized by the blueness . Even knowing how wrong it was , I wanted to melt into him , just flatten myself against that big , sturdy form and . . . let go . Breathe . Trust . "Stay
58789	58794	58431	58431	I	349	" he said softly , "
58802	58811	58815	58815	his	349	""You . . . you need to shower . "A
58818	58826	58815	58815	his	349	" You can share the shower too . ""Right
58828	58849	58815	58815	his	349	" I said darkly , while my mind filled with visions of soapy male skin and water - slicked muscles . "
58853	58862	58815	58815	his	349	"Hardy opened the door and let me escape . "
58868	58936	58815	58815	his	349	" he called after me as I went down the hall . And I had to hide a smile , not daring to look back . After that I felt restless all night , my sleep fractured by dreams , and in the morning I woke up aching and moody . I realized that every encounter I had with Hardy Cates was beginning to feel like foreplay . "Starlight
58938	59178	59265	59265	he	0	" was the theme of the night , featuring singers and musicians all paying homage to the Gershwin brothers . At least five hundred people milled through the building while breezy , jazzy music filled the air . Gershwin was a perfect choice for the evening , giving it a feeling of spontaneous , thrown - together pleasures . The Harrisburg actually consisted of two stages , the upstairs one about four stories high , a large traditional proscenium theater for spectacle productions . But the lower theater was the one I found more interesting . It was a modular stage with a segmented floor , each section mounted on its own independent pneumatic pistons . That way the floor could be reconfigured into any shape a production required . The walls were segmented too , allowing for a multitude of design possibilities . Although I was immune to Todd in any romantic sense , I enjoyed the sight of him in a tux . Judging from the looks he got , most other people did too . He was sleek and feline , the tux hanging with elegant looseness on his lean body . Todd had taken me shopping and picked out my dress , a simple long black sheath with a cowl neckline and black velvet straps . The front was relatively demure , but the back plunged so deeply that I could n't wear anything underneath . "That
59189	59195	59265	59265	he	0	" Todd had told me . "
59206	59213	59214	59214	I	349	""I'm not worried about the front , "
59218	59242	59214	59214	I	349	" Or looking perky . What worries me is that I 'm feeling breezes in places where the sun does n't usually shine . "But

59342	59351	59338	59338	Todd	0	" It 's like staring into a fire . "Gage

59520	59556	59518	59518	Jack	0	" It 'll be that way for you too . Someday you 'll meet someone , and you 'll feel like you 've been hit on the head with a two - by - four . ""I
59564	59569	59572	59573	a hottie	1220	" Jack informed me . "Your
59575	59600	59572	59573	a hottie	1220	" Todd said as Jack 's girlfriend - du - jour made her way to our table , back from the ladies ' room . "

59637	59640	59627	59627	She	1220	""Over what ? "

59683	59813	59814	59814	You	1223	" Todd told me . In response to my puzzled look , he nodded toward the other side of the table , where Dad was still holding court . My heart clutched as I saw Hardy Cates standing there shaking hands with him . Hardy did n't wear a tux with the languid ease of an aristocrat , but instead with the vague impatience of someone who 'd rather be having a cold one with the boys . Leashed and restrained in civilized clothing , he seemed more a force of nature than ever . My father was staring at him with narrow - eyed interest . As usual , he was as subtle as a pickax . And as usual , everyone held their breath when he spoke . "
59823	59833	59834	59834	You	1223	" Dad asked in a tone of amiable interest . "
59861	59866	59844	59844	his	1223	" No , sir . ""Then

59900	59934	59885	59885	Travises	106	"I did n't have to look at my father 's face to know he loved that . Loved it . On the other hand , he was n't one to forget old scores . "
59938	59944	59885	59885	Travises	106	" he said to Hardy . "
59960	59974	59975	59975	Hardy	1057	""Thank you . But you 're not the Travis I came to see . "And
60048	60059	60045	60045	I	349	" Hello , Mr. Cates . Are you having a good evening?""Hoping

60266	60275	60258	60258	I	349	"Before I could even answer , Gage said , "
60280	60286	60287	60287	I	349	"And Jack said almost simultaneously , "
60293	60328	60287	60287	I	349	"My father glanced at me from across the table and raised his brows . And my brother Joe chose that moment to come up behind my chair and rest a hand on my shoulder . "

60521	60527	60447	60447	Joe	285	"Hardy had begun to scowl . "

Sex and pain and fear were all mixed up in my head . Hardy went still . In one blistering moment , everything changed . He forced my face upward , his hand cupping the back of my head . His eyes were blue even in the darkness as he stared at me . Slowly his grip gentled , turning protective , his free hand stroking the goose - flesh on my upper arm . I realized he was stunned . It had n't occurred to him that I might be too inexperienced to know how to play the game . "Haven

He had decorated it with an eclectic mix of antique - shop furniture and a couple of his own cast - off pieces . Creams and whites were balanced by dark distressed wood . And Todd had added a few touches of whimsy , like covering the inside - facing panel of my front door with an antique bamboo hula - girl screen . Taking one look at my wretched face , Todd reached for the green chenille throw on my sofa and wrapped it around me . I snuggled in the corner of the sofa , drawing my feet back to make room for him . "Must

I wondered where Hardy was at that moment , if he had stayed at the theater after I 'd left . The temptation to call him was nearly overwhelming , but I was n't certain what I wanted to say , how much I could bring myself to explain . I resumed my place in the corner of the sofa , staring at the phone in its cradle . I wanted to hear Hardy 's voice . I thought of those fevered minutes in the stairwell before I 'd gotten afraid , when his hands and mouth had been all over me , slow and searching and tender . . . so good . So unbelievably good — The phone rang . Jolted , I set aside the wine , almost spilling it in my haste . I snatched up the phone and answered in breathless relief . "

66973	66980	66971	66971	Nick	285	" was all I could say . "You

67144	67205	67206	67206	you	1324	"Damn it , Nick knew how to get to me , how to reawaken the sense of inadequacy I 'd struggled so hard to overcome . Nick knew things about me that no one else did . We would always be linked by our shared failure — it was part of our individual identities . It could never be erased . "Are
67211	67217	67206	67206	you	1324	" I heard him ask . "I

67264	67284	67286	67286	you	1324	" Instantly I despised myself for saying it , and for feeling that I was still accountable to him . "I
67288	67292	67286	67286	you	1324	" Nick said . "
67300	67318	67295	67295	you	1324	me?""No . I do n't care if you 're dating anyone . It 's not my business . "He
67325	67340	67295	67295	you	1324	" I 'm glad you 're okay , Haven . I still love you . "That
67357	67370	67351	67351	he	1331	" I 'd rather you did n't call me again , Nick . ""I
67375	67430	67432	67432	I	349	" he repeated , and hung up . Slowly I replaced the phone in the receiver , and blotted the tears by doing a deliberate face - plant into the sofa . I stayed that way until I started to smother , and then I lifted my head and sucked in a deep breath . "I
67436	67504	67432	67432	I	349	" I said aloud , even though Nick could n't hear me . But I had n't known what love was . And I wondered how you could ever be sure , when you thought you loved someone , if you really did . The next day , it rained . During the occasional droughts , Houston got so dry that , as a local joke went , "
67512	67732	67432	67432	I	349	" But when it rained , it rained . And as a virtually flat city built around bayous , Houston had major drainage issues . During a heavy downpour , water collected high in the streets and flowed into storm drains , culverts , and bayous that directed the flow to the Gulf of Mexico . In the past , countless people had been killed by flash flooding , their cars overturned or swept away as they tried to cross the rising water . Sometimes flooding ruptured fuel pipelines , sewer lines , knocked out bridges , and made major roads inaccessible . A flood watch was announced after lunchtime , and later it was changed to an actual warning . Everyone took it in stride , since Houston residents were accustomed to flash flooding and generally knew which streets to avoid during the evening commute . Late in the day I went to a meeting at Buffalo Tower to discuss a new online system for processing maintenance requests . Vanessa had originally planned to go to the meeting , but she had changed her mind at the last minute and sent me instead . She told me it was mostly an information - gathering meeting , and she had more important things to do than talk about software . "
67740	67745	67432	67432	I	349	" she told me , "
67758	67956	67432	67432	I	349	" I was pretty sure there would be hell to pay if Vanessa had a question I could n't answer . So I resolved to find out every last detail about the software program , short of memorizing the source codes . I was relieved but puzzled that Vanessa had not mentioned one word about seeing me at the Harrisburg the previous night . And she did n't ask about Hardy . I tried to read her mood , but that was like trying to predict the weather , an iffy proposition at best . Hopefully she had decided to consider the subject as something beneath her notice . Even though Buffalo Tower was only a few blocks from 1800 Main , I drove because the rain was coming down in sheets . The building was one of the older skyscrapers , a gabled red granite structure that reminded me of a 1920s - style building . As I parked in one of the lower levels of the underground garage , I checked my phone messages . Hardy had called , I saw , and my stomach tightened . I pushed a button to hear his message . "Hey
67958	67964	67965	67965	We	1334	" His tone was brusque . "
67983	68123	68129	68129	mine	349	"That was all . I listened to the message again , and I wished I could cancel the meeting and go to him right then . But it would n't take long — I would get through it as quickly as possible , and then I would call him . By the time the software consultant , Kelly Reinhart , and I had finished , it was a few minutes past six . It might have gone on even longer , except there was a call from the security office to tell us that there had been some flooding in the lowest level of the garage . It was mostly unoccupied , since most people had already left for the day , but there were still one or two cars down there , and they should probably be moved . "Shoot
68131	68147	68129	68129	mine	349	" I said to Kelly , closing my laptop and sliding it into my briefcase . "

68258	68280	68281	68281	Kelly	211	""Great . Okay . Call up here or go to the security office off the lobby if you have any problems . "
68286	68302	68281	68281	Kelly	211	" The way this old building leaks , your car may be underwater by now . "I

They gripped me beneath the arms and pulled me onto the top of the elevator , holding me as if they feared I might skid over the side . And I probably would have , I was so covered in slime . Normally I could have clambered up the ladder with ease , but my feet and hands kept slipping on the metal . It required concentration and effort to make it to the landing , where Hardy had pried open the hoist doors . There were more people to help me , a couple of office workers , the security supervisor and guard , the newly arrived elevator technician , and even Kelly Reinhart , who could n't stop exclaiming in horror , saying over and over , "
71769	71932	71762	71762	I	349	" I ignored them all , not out of rudeness but single - minded fear . I waited beside the open doors and refused to budge , calling out Hardy 's name anxiously . I heard a lot of splashing and some grunting , and a few of the foulest curses I 'd ever heard in my life . Manuel was the first to emerge , and his companion came next . Finally Hardy crawled out of the hoistway , dripping and covered with the same dark slime I was , his business clothes plastered to his body . I was certain he did n't smell any better than I did . His hair was standing up in places . He was the most gorgeous man I 'd ever seen in my life . I launched myself at him , wrapped my arms around his waist , and drove my head against his chest . His heart thudded strongly under my ear . "

72520	72558	72518	72518	Haven	1994	" I muttered to myself , and pushed the up button . My hand was shaking . While the elevator cab descended to the garage , I waited as if I were at the gates of hell . "I'm

73826	73839	73811	73811	We	1427	" The phone rang , and Hardy glanced at the caller ID . "
73868	73901	73904	73904	Jack	0	"Oh , hell , I thought . Jack must have been just thrilled to find out I was with Hardy . I took the phone from him and pressed the talk button . "

74897	74982	74892	74892	I	349	" in a weird way , I was trying to please my mother . Even after she was gone . I felt she would have wanted me to wait , she would have told me nice girls did n't sleep around . And I had so much to make up to her for . I was never the kind of daughter she wanted — or the one Dad wanted either . I felt I owed it to her , to try and be good . "

75077	75096	75097	75097	I	349	"All movement stopped . Hardy looked up from my hand , his eyes bright with hunger . Heat . "
75101	75117	75118	75118	I	349	" He had to pause to take an extra breath . His voice was raspy . "
75130	75163	75118	75118	I	349	"I could n't look away from him . I thought of being under him , his body inside mine , and my heart started thrashing . I needed to slow it down . "

75187	75401	75184	75185	Dr Pepper	81	"Hardy let go of my hand , still staring at me . Without a word , he went to the kitchen and brought back two shot glasses and the bottle with its distinctive black label . He poured the shots in a businesslike manner , as if we were settling down for a game of poker . Hardy tossed his shot back , while I sipped mine , letting the smooth , slightly sweet liquid warm the surface of my lips . We were sitting very close . The robe had parted to reveal my bare knees , and I saw him glance down at them . As his head bent , the light rippled over his dark brown hair . I could n't stand it anymore , I had to touch him . I let my fingers brush over the side of his head , playing in the silky close - trimmed locks . One of his hands closed over my knee , engulfing it in warmth . His face lifted and I touched his jaw , the masculine scrape of bristle , laying my fingers against the softness of his lips . I explored the bold shape of his nose , one fingertip drifting to the tantalizing crook at the bridge . "

75420	75499	75402	75402	You	1449	"Hardy did n't want to talk about that . I could tell by the look in his eyes . Except that I had risked alot by confiding in him , by being honest , and he was n't going to back down from that . So he gave me a short nod and poured himself another shot , and to my regret , removed his hand from my knee . After a long pause , he said flatly , "
75594	75603	75604	75605	My mother	315	"He shook his head , his gaze distant . "

82675	82722	82669	82669	I	349	"Just thought I 'd drop by and say hi . I 'm in town to interview for a job with an insurance company . They need an estimator . I 'm sure I 'll get it — I 'm totally the best guy for the position . "He
82761	82769	82770	82770	I	349	"I'm not interested in your career plans . "
82778	82791	82770	82770	I	349	" You and I have nothing to do with each other anymore . "

82916	82968	82914	82914	Gretchen	108	"I'd had my lawyer request the return of the bracelet , and Nick had claimed it was lost . I had known better , of course . But the chance to have it back caused a stab of longing . That little piece of my past meant a lot to me . "Great

83052	83061	83062	83062	I	349	""All I want is for you to leave . "
83101	83109	83111	83111	I	349	" I 'm expecting someone , Nick . "But
83145	83152	83134	83134	Nick	285	"You said you were n't dating . ""Well
83158	83162	83134	83134	Nick	285	""How long you known him?"I
83172	83178	83179	83179	Nick	285	"Does he know about me ? "
83182	83188	83190	83190	him	1600	"He knows I 'm divorced . ""You
83193	83209	83190	83190	him	1600	" His tone was soft , but there was contempt and anger in his gaze . "You
83216	83229	83230	83230	he	1600	""Maybe he 'll have better luck thawing you out than I did . ""Maybe
83234	83536	83537	83537	Haven	1994	" I shot back , and had the satisfaction of seeing his eyes widen in surprised fury . I saw movement , someone coming to the doorway . . . Hardy 's long , lean form . He paused for a moment , assessing the situation . And his eyes narrowed as Nick turned to face him . I knew Hardy realized immediately who my visitor was . He could tell from the angry bruised weight of the air , and the bleached whiteness of my face . I had never expected to make direct physical comparisons between the two men . However , with both of them in the same room , it was impossible not to . Objectively speaking , Nick was more handsome , with smaller , more chiseled features . But Hardy 's roughcast good looks and self - assurance made Nick look callow . Unformed . As Nick stared at Hardy , his aggressive stance softened , and he actually moved back a half step . Whatever kind of man Nick had been expecting me to date , it was n't this . My former husband had always felt superior to everyone — I had never seen him so visibly intimidated . It struck me that Hardy , a seasoned , high - octane male , was the authentic version of what Nick was always pretending to be . And because Nick knew deep down that he was a fraud as a man , he occasionally gave in to the explosive rages that I had been a casualty of . Hardy walked into the apartment and came to me without hesitation , brushing by Nick . I quivered as he slid his arm around me , his eyes dark blue as he stared down at me . "
83539	83596	83537	83537	Haven	1994	" he murmured . The sound of his voice seemed to unlock a tight clamp around my lungs — I had n't been aware that I 'd been holding my breath . I took in some air . His grip tightened , and I felt some of his vitality jolt into me like an electric current . "Here
83598	83631	83632	83632	you	1994	" Hardy said , pressing something into my grasp . I looked down at the offering . Flowers . A gorgeous burst of mixed colors , rustling and fragrant in tissue wrapping . "Thank
83634	83644	83645	83645	Go	233	" I managed to say . He smiled slightly . "
83653	83836	83838	83838	you	1601	" And then , to my disbelief , I felt him pat my bottom familiarly , right in front of Nick . The classic male signal of this is mine . I heard my ex - husband take a swift breath . Darting a glance at him , I saw the glow of anger begin at his shirt collar , rising fast . There had been a time when that flush of fury would have heralded untold misery for me . But no longer . I felt a strange mixture of emotions . . . a knee - jerk uneasiness at the sight of Nick 's anger . . . a twinge of annoyance at Hardy . . . but mostly a sense of triumph , knowing that no matter how badly Nick wanted to punish me , he couldn't . And although I had never especially liked the fact that Hardy was so physically imposing , I relished it at that moment . Because there was only one thing a bully like Nick respected , and that was a bigger bully . "What
83842	83856	83838	83838	you	1601	" I heard Hardy ask casually as I went to the kitchen sink . "Job
83859	83867	83868	83868	I	349	" Nick replied in a subdued tone . "
83876	83877	83870	83871	Nick Tanner	285	" "
83884	83891	83878	83878	I	349	""I did n't catch your name . ""Hardy
83894	83937	83878	83878	I	349	"Glancing back , I saw that neither of them had moved to shake hands . The name rang a bell for Nick — I saw the flicker of recognition on his features — but he could n't quite put it in context . "
83954	83959	83960	83960	Hardy	1057	back?""You could say so , "
83978	83988	83975	83975	he	1057	" Getting friendly with one of 'em , though . "He
84029	84034	84035	84035	I	349	"Nick was just leaving , "
84039	84044	84046	84046	you	1601	" Goodbye , Nick . ""I'll
84048	84052	84054	84054	you	1601	" Nick said . "I'd
84058	84078	84080	84080	her	1601	" I turned back to the sink , unable to look at my ex - husband for another second . "You
84082	84187	84080	84080	her	1601	" came Hardy 's murmur . And there was something else , some brief exchange of words before the door closed firmly . I let out a shuddery sigh , unaware that I was gripping the bunched flower stems until I looked down and saw a smear of blood on the fleshy pad beneath my right thumb . A thorn had punctured it . I ran some water over my hand to clean it , filled a vase , and settled the flowers in it . Hardy came up behind me , gave a quiet exclamation as he saw the blood on my hand . "It
84191	84228	84080	84080	her	1601	" I said , but he took my hand and held it under the water . When the tiny wound was rinsed , he reached for a paper towel and folded it a couple of times . "Keep
84233	84325	84327	84327	me	349	" He stood facing me , gripping the paper towel against my palm . I was so unsettled by Nick 's visit that I could n't think of a thing to say . Unhappily I acknowledged that I could n't throw out my past like an old pair of shoes . I would never be free of it . I could move on , but Nick would always be able to find me , walk back into my life , remind me of things I would have given anything to forget . "Look
84329	84367	84327	84327	me	349	" Hardy said after a minute . I did n't want to . I knew he would read my face far too easily . I could n't help remembering what Todd had said about him . . . "
84397	84407	84410	84410	he	1602	" But I forced myself to meet his gaze . "Did
84415	84419	84410	84410	he	1602	" Hardy asked . "No
84426	84429	84431	84431	he	1602	""What did he want?""He
84445	84446	84431	84431	he	1602	""Like what?"I
84497	84502	84503	84503	I	349	" Nothing I want , "
84523	84531	84534	84534	he	1602	" What did you tell Nick at the door?""I
84546	84550	84540	84540	I	349	"My eyes widened . "
84557	84561	84562	84562	I	349	you?"He looked smug . "
84565	84586	84587	84587	I	349	""You arrogant . . . Oh , I ca n't believe you just took it upon yourself to . . . "
84601	84616	84594	84594	Hardy	1057	" That 's what you want , is n't it ? Not to see him again?""Yes
84656	84665	84643	84643	you	1608	"He had the nerve to smile at that . "
84680	84687	84676	84676	I	349	"I gave him a dark glance . "
84698	84718	84719	84719	I	349	"Hardy 's arms went around me . He bent his head , and his low voice caressed my ear . "
84730	84769	84719	84719	I	349	"A baffling wave of heat went through me , something rooted in excitement , too intense to name . And with that came a touch of queasiness , and I felt scared and all twisted up with desire . "Worth
84777	84792	84793	84793	I	349	" Hardy asked . I was n't entirely sure what we were talking about . "
84813	84819	84805	84805	you	1606	"He nuzzled behind my ear . "
84866	84872	84856	84856	I	349	"I was n't breathing well . "
84881	84924	84879	84879	Hardy	1057	"Both his hands curved around my scalp , angling my face upward . His thumbs stroked over my cheeks . He gave me a look that dismantled my brain and set off an erotic flush that covered me from head to toe . "
84934	85010	84879	84879	Hardy	1057	"More arrogance , I thought dimly . But much to the shame of my politically correct self , it was a huge turn - on , sending heat mainlining through every vein . My fists clenched reflexively in his shirt . It was a beautiful light - gray shirt that probably cost the equivalent of the average mortgage payment . And I saw my finger had left a bright red splotch of blood on it . "Oh
85014	85016	85017	85017	Hardy	1057	""What ? "
85024	85042	85017	85017	Hardy	1057	" Damn , it 's bleeding again . We need to get you a Band - Aid . ""I
85060	85067	85055	85055	I	349	"He seemed amused by my concern . "
85074	85098	85099	85099	I	349	""I hope I have n't ruined it . Maybe it 's not too late if I soak it in the sink . . . "
85116	85132	85099	85099	I	349	" It is a silk blend ? Maybe I should n't try to wash it . ""Forget
85142	85153	85139	85139	your	349	""Is it dry - clean only ? What does the tag say?""I
85159	85163	85164	85164	I	349	""Such a man . "
85915	85921	85922	85922	he	1057	"Haven , look at me , "
85961	85967	85968	85968	he	1057	" Take a deep breath , "
85972	85988	85968	85968	he	1057	" I 'm not going to touch you . No , sit still . Breathe . "My
86034	86045	86020	86020	Hardy	1057	" I 'll get you some water . Where are the glasses?""To
86052	86292	86293	86293	I	349	" I croaked . He went to the kitchen area , and I heard the tap running . While he was gone , I pulled his shirt on and wrapped it around myself . I was clumsy , trembling with aftershocks . As I realized what had just happened , how I had freaked out on him , I wanted to die . I buried my head in my arms . I had thought everything was fine . It had felt so good , but all the excitement and pleasure had turned to panic . Something was really , really wrong with me . And I knew if I could n't be close to this man , now , I was never going to be close to anyone . I was never going to be okay . Swamped in despair , I huddled in the corner of the sofa . Hardy sat on the coffee table , facing me . Silently he gave me the glass of water . My mouth had gone as dry as dust , and I drank thirstily . But after a few swallows , the sick feeling threatened to come back , and I set the glass aside . I forced myself to look at Hardy . He was pale under his tan , his eyes electric blue . My mind was a complete blank . What the hell should I say to him ? "
86304	86320	86297	86297	I	349	" I heard myself mumble . I 'm sorry . His gaze locked on me . "
86332	86409	86330	86330	we	1621	with?"CHAPTER FIFTEENI really did n't want to get into that . I wished Hardy would go away and leave me the privacy for tears . I wanted to cry and go to sleep , and never wake up . But it was pretty clear Hardy was n't going anywhere until he got an explanation . And God knew I owed him one . I gestured clumsily to a chair on the other side of the table . "
86430	86452	86453	86453	I	349	"Hardy shook his head . The only sign of emotion on his face were the twin lines notched between his brows . "
86457	86465	86453	86453	I	349	" he said in a husky voice . "
86495	86518	86480	86480	I	349	"I looked away from him , shrinking into the folds of his shirt . I could only talk in fits and starts . "
86553	86567	86546	86546	Nick	285	"The room was deathly quiet . I still could n't look at him . "It
86574	86578	86546	86546	Nick	285	" I said , "
86653	86882	86640	86640	He	349	"I went on and on . I told Hardy everything . It was awful . It was a train wreck happening right in front of me and I could n't do anything about it , except that not only was I watching , I was also the train . I confessed things that in a saner moment I would have had dignity or sense to filter out . But there was no filter . All my defenses were down . Hardy listened with his face averted , his profile shadowed . But his body was tense all over , the stark relief of jutting muscles in his arms and shoulders more eloquent than words . I even told him about the last night with Nick , the rape , being thrown out , the barefoot walk to the grocery store . While I talked , I cringed at the ugliness of what I 'd been through . There was a certain relief in it though . An ease . Because I knew that with all the baggage I was unloading , any chance of a relationship with Hardy was vanishing . Syllable by syllable . No man would want to deal with this . And that was for the best , because it was obvious I was n't ready for a relationship anyway . So this was goodbye . "I
86891	86897	86640	86640	He	349	" I said to Hardy . "
86918	86933	86934	86934	You	1623	" My eyes watered , and I blinked fiercely and talked in a rush . "
86980	87035	86977	86977	I	349	"I fell silent then . My eyes would n't stop leaking . I could n't think of anything else to tell Hardy , except that he could go if he wanted . But he stood and went to the fireplace and braced a hand on the mantel . He stared into the empty space . "
87045	87052	87036	87036	I	349	" I heard him say softly . "
87072	87163	87164	87164	Nick	285	"I'd heard louder and more colorful threats , but never one delivered with a quiet sincerity that raised all the hairs on the back of my neck . Hardy turned to look at me then . I felt myself blanch as I saw his expression . It was not the first time I 'd been alone in a room with a man who had murder in his eyes . This time , thankfully , the violence was n't directed at me . All the same , it made me fidgety . "
87173	87177	87164	87164	Nick	285	" I said . "I
87184	87202	87164	87164	Nick	285	" Hardy stared at me for a moment , registering my uneasiness . His expression deliberately softened . "
87221	87243	87211	87211	he	1626	"I almost smiled at that . I let my shoulders slump , feeling drained in the aftermath of my personal catastrophe . "
87264	87273	87260	87260	I	349	" I blotted my eyes with a shirtsleeve . "
87307	87313	87323	87323	you	1627	" Hardy watched me intently . "
87348	87351	87340	87340	you	1627	"I nodded . "
87384	87389	87340	87340	you	1627	""Was it always bad with him?"It
87410	87479	87404	87404	I	349	" It started out okay , I guess , but the longer the marriage went on , the worse things got in the bedroom , until I was mostly just waiting for it to be over . Because I knew it did n't matter to Nick if I was enjoying it or not . And it hurt sometimes when I was . . . you know , dry . "
87577	87584	87585	87585	I	349	"I guess it 's over now , "
87589	87590	87585	87585	I	349	" Right?""Is
87594	87603	87606	87606	you	0	want?"My throat clenched . I shook my head . "
87609	87613	87614	87614	I	349	Haven?""I want you , "
87625	87633	87614	87614	I	349	" But I ca n't have you . "Hardy
87651	87664	87667	87667	him	1057	" Haven , sweetheart . . . you 've already got me . "I
87683	87690	87691	87691	he	1057	" I 'm not going anywhere , "
87694	87720	87691	87691	he	1057	" And you 're not broken . You 're scared , like any woman would be , after what that son of a bitch did . "
87735	87742	87743	87743	I	349	" Will you let me hold you now?"Before
87868	87873	87857	87857	Hardy	1057	" Is it this ? "
87885	87890	87874	87874	He	1057	" Feeling that makes you nervous?"I
87928	87939	87913	87913	His	1057	" Should I visit the therapist with you ? Would that help?"I
87975	87983	87984	87984	I	349	" I want to fix it now , "
87988	88030	87984	87984	I	349	" Let 's just . . . let 's go into the bedroom and do it . No matter what I say or even if I freak out , just hold me down and keep going till it 's finished and — "
88031	88043	88044	88044	Hardy	1057	" Hell no , we 're not going to do that . "
88050	88073	88074	88074	He	1057	" You 're not a horse to be broken to saddle . You do n't need to be forced , you need — "

88100	88125	88093	88093	he	1057	" I do n't do my best thinking when all the blood leaves my brain . So you should probably sit next to me . "A

88251	88298	88246	88246	His	1057	" We 're not going to do anything you 're not ready for . Let 's get you dressed , and I 'll take you out to dinner . We 'll have some wine , and you can relax . We 'll figure this out later . "But

88373	88382	88369	88369	I	349	" would you . . . indulge me a little?"A
88412	88416	88417	88417	he	1057	" A little , "
88420	88432	88417	88417	he	1057	" or a lot . Just tell me what you want . ""I

88531	88536	88552	88552	Hardy	1057	" You trust me , Haven?"I
88546	88549	88552	88552	Hardy	1057	" Yes . "Without
88898	88951	88892	88892	Hardy	1057	" I want you to understand . . . you 're safe . I 'm not going to hurt you in any way . And if I do something you do n't want , or you start to feel scared , I 'll stop . I 'm not going to lose control . "
88972	88984	88988	88988	his	1057	" I 'm just going to find out what you like . "My
89004	89015	88993	88993	his	1057	" I want to find out what you like too . ""I
89023	89039	89040	89040	I	349	" he whispered , peeling my clothes off as if he were unwrapping a bandage . "
89050	89081	89044	89044	I	349	"His breath fell on me with a sweet burn as he drew his mouth over my throat and breasts . He knew what he was doing , taking his time . "
89084	89418	89419	89419	You	1639	" he murmured , his fingers gliding over my straining limbs . I clutched at his T - shirt , trying to pull it off . He helped me , stripping away the layer of thin cotton and tossing it to the floor . His skin was as brown as cinnamon against the antique - white bed linens . There was a light mat of hair on his chest , so unlike Nick 's smoothness . I put my arms around his neck and kissed him , gasping as my breasts pressed into the warm , tickling hair . Hardy caressed and explored as if he were intent on discovering every detail of my body . I realized he was playing with me , lifting and turning me , pressing kisses in unexpected places . He was so strong , his body sleek and beautiful in the muted light . I crawled over him and rubbed my nose and chin into the springy - soft fur of his chest . I trailed my fingers to his midriff , where the skin was satin - smooth and taut over bands of muscle . And lower , to the edge of his jeans . . . and lower still , to the part of him I was nervous of . Watching my face , Hardy eased slowly onto his back , allowing me to explore him . I touched him over his jeans , hesitantly tracing the jut of his erection . His breath roughened , and I sensed how difficult it was for him to hold himself in check . My fingers wandered to the base of the shaft , where the flesh was weighted and tight - mounded , and I heard him give a soft grunt . A dart of excitement went through me as I realized how much he liked that , and I did it again , circling my palm over the taut denim . A laughing groan escaped him . "
89428	89433	89419	89419	You	1639	you?"I shook my head . "
89440	89547	89419	89419	You	1639	"He pulled me farther over his chest , guided my head to his , and gave me another of those insatiable kisses , until I was rising and falling with the rhythm of his breathing as if I were floating on ocean waves . He reached down to his jeans and unfastened them . I hesitated and slid my hand down to grip him gingerly . At this point there was no doubt that Hardy was built to scale all over . It was , as Todd would say , quite a package . But instead of greeting the discovery with a hallelujah , I grimaced . "
89557	89562	89548	89548	You	1639	" I said doubtfully . "
89576	89583	89584	89584	Hardy	1057	""Can't help you there , honey . "
89588	89601	89602	89602	He	1057	" That one 's not available in a mid - sized edition . "
89677	89679	89680	89680	he	1057	"Scared ? "
89700	89721	89690	89690	I	349	" I guess I do n't like it that way , with you behind me . It reminds me of — "
89886	89894	89895	89895	I	349	" It 's not working for me , "
89899	89904	89895	89895	I	349	" Maybe we should — "
89905	89910	89911	89911	he	349	" Close your eyes , "
89914	89918	89911	89911	he	349	" Lie still . "I
89978	89981	89982	89982	he	1057	" Easy , "
90002	90004	90005	90005	I	349	"Wait , "
90008	90019	90020	90020	I	349	" That 's enough , I ca n't . . . "
90044	90048	90029	90029	Hardy	1057	" Am I hurting you?""No
90050	90063	90065	90065	I	349	"His hand came to my stomach , rubbing in a warm circle . "
90069	90084	90065	90065	I	349	honey?""No , it 's just . . . I 've never done that before . "
90124	90131	90135	90135	I	349	" Do n't you want to try it?""Well
90164	90179	90148	90148	I	349	" I broke off with a little yelp as he bent over me again . "
90183	90188	90189	90189	You	1057	doing?"His voice was muffled . "
90216	90254	90256	90256	me	349	" I squeaked as he pinned my legs , holding them wide . Hardy gave a low laugh , enjoying my discomfort . There was no doubt about it — I was in bed with the devil . "
90260	90264	90256	90256	me	349	" he coaxed . "This
90271	90272	90256	90256	me	349	""Why not?""Because
90274	90280	90256	90256	me	349	" I twisted and panted . "
90303	90336	90337	90337	Hardy	1057	" My mind went blank as I felt him lick deep into that vulnerable , secret place . I managed a feeble push against his head . There was no dislodging him . "
90339	90422	90337	90337	Hardy	1057	" I tried again , but the delicate moist strokes opened the seam of closed flesh , and the pleasure was so acute I could n't think or move . He followed the sensation to its center , using the tip of his tongue , and then he breathed on the throb and ache , steam fanning across wet skin . My heartbeat slammed so fast that I could barely hear his mocking whisper over the blood - rhythm in my ears . "Still
90428	90450	90337	90337	Hardy	1057	Haven?"My eyes were wet . I was strung tight with pleasure , shaking with it , but it was n't enough . "
90457	90534	90337	90337	Hardy	1057	" I was shocked by the sound of my own voice , so hoarse and low . And even more shocked by the way I cried out as he slid in one finger , and then another , stretching the glazed softness , while his mouth searched the furled flesh . The sensation was excruciating , my hips hitching upward and falling back . But release kept skittering out of reach , maddening in its elusiveness . "I
90538	90542	90543	90543	I	349	" I groaned , "
90549	90557	90543	90543	I	349	""Yes you can . Just stop trying . ""I
90563	90766	90543	90543	I	349	"His wicked fingers began a slow in - and - out slide . I sobbed as a surge began , my flesh rippling , closing . His knuckles wriggled deeper . His tongue flicked steadily , and his mouth . . . his mouth . . . I was gripped by an overpowering swell , every heartbeat , breath , impulse , guided into violent tumbling spasms . I arched into the intense pleasure , my trembling hands secured around his head . Hardy pushed his fingers as deep as possible and his tongue circled to catch the last few twitches of release . When his touch was withdrawn , I whimpered and reached for him , tugging him upward . He rolled me to my side and put his arms around me , and kissed the tear smudges at the corners of my eyes . We were quiet for a minute , my bare feet tucked between his , his palm warm on my bottom . I felt the urgency beneath his stillness , like the false lull of the bull pen before the animal exploded out of the chute . My hand stole to the open waist of his jeans . "
90771	90784	90543	90543	I	349	" I whispered . Still breathing heavily , Hardy shook his head . "
90799	90801	90802	90802	I	349	""Quit ? "
90808	90817	90802	90802	I	349	" No , there 's no quitting now . "
90837	90856	90861	90861	you	349	" If you do n't make love to me , Hardy Cates , I 'll never forgive you . ""I
90863	90867	90868	90868	I	349	""All the way , "
90871	90879	90881	90881	him	349	"You're not ready for all the way . "I
90897	90905	90906	90906	I	349	" You ca n't tell me no , "
90910	90921	90923	90923	my	349	" It would be bad for my self - esteem . "I
90983	90997	90976	90976	he	349	" My wallet is in the kitchen . I 'll go get it . "I
91001	91015	90976	90976	he	349	" We do n't need a condom . I 'm on the pill . "His
91031	91097	91025	91025	I	349	" Since Nick never wanted me to have them , they became sort of an issue with me . I feel more in control . . . safer . . . when I take them . And the doctor said it would n't hurt me . So I never miss a day . Believe me , we 're covered . Even without any other protection . "Hardy
91112	91122	91025	91025	I	349	" I 've never done it without a condom . ""Ever
91124	91135	91136	91136	I	349	" I asked , bemused . He shook his head . "
91175	91184	91187	91187	I	349	""You've never had a girlfriend who went on birth control?""Even
91208	91228	91193	91193	I	349	"Perhaps some women would have taken offense at that , but I understood all too well about trust issues . "
91233	91244	91193	91193	I	349	" I said , leaning up to kiss his chin . "
91252	91312	91314	91314	me	349	"Hardy did n't move , however . He kept staring at me with those vivid eyes , and I felt something intimate and visceral flourish between us , a sense of connection I found more than a little alarming . It felt as if all the rhythms of my body and his had been set to one invisible metronome . "You
91318	91322	91314	91314	me	349	" he said . "
91332	91569	91314	91314	me	349	"I eased to my back , and my breath quickened , and so did his . He undressed and pressed against me . He was gentle . . . so gentle . . . but I could feel the power and weight of him , and I tensed . He nudged more strongly until we both felt the snug , supple yielding , softness giving way to hardness . Me , taking him inside . Opening to him . The blue eyes turned drowsy , pleasure - clouded , his lashes throwing spiked shadows on his cheeks . He entered me by slow inches , giving me time to adjust , to span the heavy invasion . I turned my face against his arm , my cheek tucked against taut muscle . When I 'd taken all of him I could , Hardy coaxed me to lift my knees , spread them wider , and he gave me even more . So tight , wet , my body offering lubricious welcome . I saw the concern on his face being replaced by lust . I loved the way he stared at me , as if he wanted to eat me alive . I wriggled , uncomfortable with all that fullness inside me , and Hardy shivered and gasped out a few words that sounded like , Oh God please do n't move Haven baby please . . ."Feel
91572	91596	91314	91314	me	349	" I whispered . Hardy shook his head , struggling to breathe . His face was flushed as if with a high fever . "
91599	91603	91314	91314	me	349	" I asked . "Felt
91610	91630	91696	91696	he	349	" he managed to say , his accent slurry - like he 'd just done about ten tequila shots . "
91666	91678	91656	91656	I	349	"Smiling , I pulled his head down to mine and whispered , "
91684	91687	91688	91688	His	349	attack?""Not sure . "
91706	91709	91710	91710	he	349	" Hell , "
91714	91727	91710	91710	he	349	" I do n't know if I can hold on to this . "I
91747	91753	91710	91710	he	349	" Do n't hold back . "He
91834	91842	91843	91843	he	349	" Did I find a sweet spot ? "
92057	92059	92060	92060	I	349	"Hardy , "
92071	92076	92060	92060	I	349	" Please . . . "
92077	92081	92082	92082	He	349	" Please what ? "
92108	92112	92114	92114	his	349	" You know . "He
92467	92469	92460	92460	I	349	"Haven , "
92480	92484	92485	92485	His	1057	" Bad dream ? "
92497	92501	92485	92485	His	1057	"Uh - huh . "His
92747	92751	92752	92752	Hardy	1057	"Call in sick , "
92759	92768	92752	92752	Hardy	1057	" Spend the day in bed with me . ""I
92772	92777	92778	92778	They	1650	" I had protested . "
92784	92788	92778	92778	They	1650	""I need you . "That
92794	92802	92778	92778	They	1650	" You 've had enough for now . "Hardy
92815	92823	92824	92824	he	1057	" I have n't even gotten started , "
92828	92846	92824	92824	he	1057	" In fact , I 've been holding back on account of you being out of practice . "We
92993	93008	93009	93009	she	817	" I 've sent you some e - mails about the latest maintenance contracts , "
93014	93019	93009	93009	she	817	"Good morning , Vanessa . ""Print
93036	93038	93042	93042	she	817	""Absolutely . "
93047	93060	93042	93042	she	817	" Wait , Vanessa . There 's something we need to discuss . "She
93080	93083	93042	93042	she	817	" please . ""Yes
93085	93092	93042	93042	she	817	" she asked with dangerous softness . "I
93146	93151	93130	93130	I	349	"Her eyes widened dramatically . "
93194	93213	93180	93180	you	1656	" Her voice turned soft , as if she were trying to explain something to a small child . "
93233	93311	93315	93315	me	349	"I swallowed hard , longing to inform her that I had n't left Nick , I 'd been beaten up and thrown out . But one of Vanessa 's favorite tricks was to make accusations in her gentlest voice until I ended up saying things I had n't meant to say . I was n't going to fall for it anymore . And there were some things in my private life that were going to stay private . "You
93319	93324	93325	93325	Nick	285	" I said calmly . "
93345	93359	93360	93360	He	1656	"Vanessa shook her head and gave me a cool glance overlaid with pity . "
93385	93471	93374	93374	He	1656	"I suppressed a bitter smile . How he 'd been treated ? That was what a narcissist did . He turned around and accused you of doing what he 'd done , and he could be so convincing that you might even end up doubting yourself . I was sure Nick had told people that I 'd treated him badly , that I 'd walked out on him . But I could n't control what he said , or whether others believed him or not . "He
93476	93480	93481	93482	Every spider	1659	" I allowed . "
93490	93500	93481	93482	Every spider	1659	""There are two sides to every story , Haven . "
93510	93525	93481	93482	Every spider	1659	"Of course there are . But that does n't mean both sides are valid . "
93544	93563	93537	93537	I	349	" And some people are all bad , Vanessa . I would n't wish Nick on any woman . "
93571	93579	93567	93567	I	349	"I never realized how naive you are , "
93584	93601	93580	93581	my boss	2603	" I hope someday you learn to look at the world with a little more sophistication . ""I'll
93606	93664	93666	93666	your	1660	" I muttered , and swiveled in my chair until my back was facing her . It was not a surprise when Nick called in the middle of the day . I had already figured he 'd gotten my work number from Vanessa . But the sound of his voice still caused my stomach to turn over . "How
93671	93675	93676	93676	I	349	" Nick asked . "
93689	93695	93696	93696	I	349	""Don't call me at work , "
93700	93709	93696	93696	I	349	" Or at home , for that matter . ""There
93724	93728	93714	93715	a woman	2024	" Nick continued , "
93738	93757	93758	93758	He	1663	"I smiled a little , enjoying the fact that my ex - husband was so intimidated by Hardy . "
93765	93769	93770	93770	He	1663	" I said . "
93788	93798	93799	93799	You	1665	"Nick did n't seem to notice that last comment . "
93821	93836	93799	93799	You	1665	you?"I wondered if Nick had watched my apartment . That gave me the creeps . "
93843	93847	93799	93799	You	1665	" I said . "I
93877	93970	93873	93873	you	1665	"Once that comment would have hurt . And I might have even believed that I was frigid . Now I knew better . And I knew Nick for exactly what he was , a narcissist who was incapable of caring about anyone but himself . I could never change him , or make him aware of his own flaws . Nick wanted what he wanted . . . he did n't understand himself any better than a shark was aware of why it wanted to kill and eat . It just did . "Well
93980	93984	93973	93973	God	86	" I said . "
93998	94011	93996	93996	Nick	285	""What about your things ? What about that bracelet from your aunt — "
94012	94022	94023	94023	I	349	" If it means having to see you again , "
94026	94033	94023	94023	I	349	" it 's not worth it . ""I'll
94041	94045	94046	94046	I	349	" he threatened . "
94053	94054	94055	94055	I	349	" "
94062	94197	94055	94055	I	349	" And I hung up on him , feeling triumphant and disgusted at the same time . I decided not to tell Hardy , or anyone , about the call from Nick . It would take little provocation for Hardy to track my ex - husband down and wipe him off the planet . And while I would n't have minded having Nick gone for good , I would n't be too crazy about visiting Hardy behind bars . Over the next two weeks I learned a lot about Hardy . We spent every possible minute together , not by any plan or design . It was just that he had become the person I most wanted to be with . And the puzzling thing was , he seemed to feel the same way . "It
94203	94225	94055	94055	I	349	" I told Todd on the phone one night , while I was waiting for Hardy to come home from work . "
94269	94293	94254	94254	He	0	""No one 's perfect . You 're leaving something out . What is it ? He must be hung like a cocktail weenie . ""No
94306	94313	94314	94314	Todd	0	" There was a pronounced silence . "
94319	94336	94317	94317	you	1670	there?""Yeah . I 'm just trying to think of a good reason to continue our friendship . "I
94339	94347	94317	94317	you	1670	" Jealousy is so unattractive , Todd . ""It
94374	94379	94367	94367	Warts	238	spray?""Would chest hair be a flaw?""Oh
94383	94388	94367	94367	Warts	238	" Todd sounded relieved . "
94405	94435	94397	94397	You	1672	"I thought it best not to argue , even though I disagreed . There was something infinitely comforting and sexy about being held against a broad , hairy chest . "Haven
94437	94445	94397	94397	You	1672	" Todd said , sounding more serious . "
94454	94466	94448	94448	I	349	""The thing about not being a simple guy ? About being twisty twisted?""Yeah
94492	95085	94481	94481	sweetheart	0	"Later I pondered what it meant to keep your eyes open in a relationship . I did n't think I was idealizing Hardy . . . it was just that I liked so much about him . I liked the way he talked to me , and even more , the way he listened . I especially liked how tactile he was . He gave impromptu shoulder rubs , pulled me onto his lap , played with my hair , held hands . I had n't been brought up in a physically affectionate family — Travises put a high premium on personal space . And after my experiences with Nick , I had never thought I could stand being touched again . Hardy had charmed me more than anyone I 'd ever met . He was engaging , playful . . . but always and foremost a man . He opened doors , carried the packages , paid for dinner , and would have been mortally offended by the suggestion that a woman do any of those things . Having lived with a husband who had spent most of his time inflating his own fragile ego , I appreciated Hardy 's self - assurance . He had no problem admitting that he 'd made a mistake or that he did n't understand something , only turned it into an opportunity to ask questions . I had seldom , if ever , met a man with such an endless reserve of energy , or such keen appetites . Privately I acknowledged my father had probably been right about Hardy wanting more . . . and it did n't stop at money . He wanted respect , power , success , all the things he must have hungered for when the world had considered him a nobody . But the world 's opinion had n't crushed him . There had been something in him , a drive fueled by pride and anger , that had insisted he deserved more . He was not unlike my father , who had also started from nothing . The thought was a little scary . I was getting involved with a man who might turn out to be as much of an ambitious , driven hard - ass as Churchill Travis . How did you handle a guy like that ? How did you keep it from happening?I knew hardy thought of me as sheltered . Compared to him , I probably was . When I had traveled overseas , I had gone with college friends and stayed in nice hotels that were paid for with my father 's credit card . When Hardy had gone overseas , he had worked on offshore rigs in places like Mexico , Saudi Arabia , and Nigeria . Fourteen days on , fourteen off . He 'd learned to adapt quickly to foreign cultures and customs . And it struck me that this was the same way he was approaching Houston society . Learn the customs . Adapt . Find your way in . We talked far into the night , exchanging stories about growing up , past relationships , things that had changed us . Hardy was open about most things , but there were a few subjects he was not willing to discuss . His father , for example , and whatever he 'd done to land in prison . And Hardy preferred to keep his mouth shut about his past love life , which made me rampantly curious . "I
95096	95104	94481	94481	sweetheart	0	" I said to him one night . "
95115	95164	95110	95110	You	1673	"Hardy settled me more comfortably on his chest . We were in his bed , a California king - sized piled with pillows stuffed with Scandia down . It was covered in acres of eight - hundred - thread - count sheets , and bedspreads of raw silk . "Honey
95179	95183	95110	95110	You	1673	""Then why did n't you?"Hardy
95197	95204	95110	95110	You	1673	" I was waiting for you . ""Ha
95219	95227	95228	95228	he	349	""I do n't remember any of them , "
95232	95243	95244	95244	Hardy	1057	" Beebe Whitney . Does that name ring a bell ? "
95251	95256	95244	95244	Hardy	1057	" Why do you mention her?""She
95272	95286	95244	95244	Hardy	1057	"He was quiet for a moment , his hand sifting through my hair . "
95289	95364	95365	95365	I	349	" Hell , yes , I was jealous . In fact , I was astonished by the amount of emotional poison that came from imagining him in bed with Beebe in all her spray - tanned perfection . I nodded against his chest . Hardy rolled me to my back and looked down at me . The lamplight played over his strong features , a stray gleam catching the faint smile on his lips . "
95384	95389	95378	95378	I	349	""Didn't ask you to , "
95406	95432	95394	95394	His	349	" I learned something from every woman I 've been with . And I needed to learn a lot before I was ready for you . "I
95435	95445	95446	95446	I	349	" Why ? Because I 'm complicated ? Difficult ? "
95467	95489	95462	95462	He	349	" Because there 's so much I want to do for you . So many ways I want to please you . "
95510	95519	95490	95490	He	349	" Those women were just practice for you . ""Good
95522	95538	95490	95490	He	349	" I said grudgingly . His hand covered my heart with light , warm pressure . "
95602	95607	95585	95585	'em	1683	" His mouth twisted . "
95645	95646	95637	95637	I	349	" "
95649	95653	95654	95654	I	349	" I prompted . "When
95676	95686	95669	95669	I	349	" He traced an idle pattern on my chest . "
95692	95698	95687	95687	You	1685	""In a good way , you mean?""In
95703	95709	95710	95710	I	349	""I never slow anyone down , "
95713	95721	95710	95710	I	349	" I 'm not a restful person . "A
95728	95736	95739	95739	me	349	" Whatever you do works for me . "He
95770	95778	95762	95762	his	1685	"Hardy?""Mmmn?"I put my arms around his neck . "
95793	95806	95807	95807	I	349	"He drew back to look down at me , his gaze caressing . "
95815	95819	95807	95807	I	349	" he admitted . "You
95825	95830	95831	95831	I	349	" I said earnestly . "
95859	95867	95848	95848	I	349	" His lips twitched with rueful amusement . "
95890	95894	95895	95895	I	349	""Well , regardless , "
95904	95920	95895	95895	I	349	" You do n't have to be careful with me . I can take it . "The
95929	95932	95934	95934	his	349	" Okay . "I
95998	96006	95993	95993	his	349	" You want to try something new , Haven?"I
96098	96102	96103	96103	he	1057	" Hold on , "
96196	96199	96200	96200	Hardy	1057	"Just you , "
96209	96216	96203	96203	he	1057	" All I want is you . "I
96254	96260	96261	96261	I	349	SEVENTEEN"Let me get this straight , "
96272	96321	96261	96261	I	349	" You 're not going to cut Hardy any slack even though he saved my life two weeks ago ? What does he have to do for you to treat him politely ? . . . Come up with a cure for cancer ? Save the world from an asteroid?"My
96326	96345	96261	96261	I	349	" I did n't say I was n't going to be polite . I can do that much . ""Gee
96353	96635	96636	96636	I	349	"That night Hardy and I were going to a rigs - to - reefs party , which was being sponsored jointly by a couple of major oil companies . Rigs - to - reefs was a program in which companies chopped off the tops of their used platforms and left them on the ocean floor to create an artificial reef . Since the entire Gulf of Mexico was mud bottom , the rigs created a supportive environment for the fish . Despite protests from naturalists , fish seemed to like the abandoned platforms . And oil companies loved the program because it saved them millions in lieu of platform recovery . So they had donated an exhibit to the Houston Aquarium to display how much , in their opinion , rigs - to - reefs benefited the Gulf . My family would be at the exhibit opening . And I had done my best to make it clear that not only would I attend with Hardy Cates , but I expected the Travises to behave like reasonable human beings . Apparently that was asking a lot . I had called Joe , who had informed me darkly that I was being used by Hardy , just as he had predicted . And now Jack was being stubborn . I certainly did n't expect anything different from my father , whose opinions were as unalterable as his blood type . That left only Gage to worry about . . . but I felt certain he would be decent to Hardy , if only for my sake . He 'd indicated as much when I had talked to him after the elevator incident . "All
96640	96644	96636	96636	I	349	" Jack continued , "
96691	96697	96677	96679	either of us	2020	""Oh . I get it . "His
96701	96702	96677	96679	either of us	2020	" What?""You're
96747	96770	96771	96771	He	1697	""Damn it , Haven , quit fighting like a girl . It has nothing to do with the size of my club . "
96779	96787	96771	96771	He	1697	" Come inside for a minute , will you?""No
96822	96828	96807	96807	I	349	" I broke off abruptly . "Your
96831	96854	96855	96855	Boyfriend	240	" Jack demanded . I shook my head , disconcerted . God knew what word or phrase I should apply in Hardy . "
96856	96900	96855	96855	Boyfriend	240	" sounded so high - schoolish . And inappropriate , since Hardy was fat from a boy . Lover . . . well , that was old - fashioned and melodramatic . Significant other ? Friend with benefits ? No , and no . "My
96903	96914	96855	96855	Boyfriend	240	" I said , and gave him a warning frown . "
96942	96985	96932	96932	I	349	""I do n't get what you 're asking for . If you want my approval , you 're not getting it . I do n't know enough about the bastard yet . . . and what I do know is n't consistent . "My
97001	97009	97010	97010	I	349	" I do n't want your approval , "
97014	97040	97010	97010	I	349	" Just basic good manners . I 'm just asking you not to be an asshole for two hours . Think you can manage that ? "
97041	97044	97045	97045	Jack	0	" Shit , "
97058	97073	97045	97045	Jack	0	" Bossy as you 're getting , I almost feel sorry for the guy . "The
97562	97576	97553	97553	Roy	242	" Hardy , did n't I warn you not to date a woman who reads?"Hardy
97583	97591	97592	97592	he	242	" Keeps the arguing to a minimum , "
97595	97609	97592	97592	he	242	" No point in trying when I know she 's going to win . ""I
97617	97624	97625	97625	I	349	" I murmured to Hardy afterward . "
97635	97644	97645	97645	Hardy	1057	""I like a woman who speaks her mind , "
97648	97689	97691	97691	him	1057	" Besides , you were right . Technology is nowhere near where it needs to be , for the extraction to be worth it . As things stand , it 's bad for the environment and it 's too expensive . "I
97696	97716	97691	97691	him	1057	" If technology made the process cheaper but it was still bad for the environment , would you go for it?""No
97718	97747	97691	97691	him	1057	" he began , but before he could explain why , we were interrupted by a booming laugh . A heavy hand on my shoulder turned me around . "Uncle
97750	97754	97691	97691	him	1057	" I exclaimed . "
97763	98054	98057	98059	my favorite girl	1735	it?"T.J. Bolt was n't really my uncle , but I 'd known him since I was born . He was Dad 's closest friend , and I suspected he 'd always had a crush on my mother . He liked women a little too much , having been married five times . T.J. was one of the more colorful characters in the oil patch . As a young man in East Texas , T.J. had gotten his start by working at a drilling equipment supplies company . Somehow he 'd found the money to buy land and mineral rights for some productive fields , and he 'd used the profits to buy more land , and more . He had his fingers in a lot of pies . And he was courted by landmen from every major development company , all eager to negotiate for potentially priceless leases . I'd never seen T.J. without his signature white beaver - felt hat with five inch brim and six - inch crown . A Western hat of those dimensions would have looked ridiculous on a regular - sized man , but T.J. was a mountain of a human being . He was taller than Hardy , and outweighed him by at least half again . One of his beefy wrists was weighted with a yellow - gold and diamond Rolex . A sausage - sized forefinger sported a gold nugget ring shaped like Texas . Even as a child I had been subjected to T.J. 's disconcerting habit of kissing females of all ages on the lips . Tonight was no exception . He planted a wrinkly kiss on me , smelling like saddle leather and sweet cologne and La Unica cigars . "
98062	98066	98057	98059	my favorite girl	1735	" he boomed , "
98071	98075	98076	98076	Hardy	1057	rascal?""Evening , sir , "
98089	98095	98076	98076	Hardy	1057	"You've already met Mr. Cates ? "
98098	98109	98110	98110	T.J.	244	T.J."We did some talkin ' on my Gregg County property , "
98113	98121	98122	98122	He	1057	" Could n't quite settle on terms . "
98127	98140	98122	98122	He	1057	" Man 's got ta have deep pockets , dealing with me . ""T.J.
98147	98152	98153	98153	He	1057	" Hardy said ruefully . "
98161	98184	98153	98153	He	1057	"The old man chuckled richly . He put a fleshy arm around me and squeezed . He gave Hardy a meaningful glance . "
98192	98196	98197	98197	She	1737	" he said . "
98213	98219	98197	98197	She	1737	""Yes sir , I will . "After
98235	98244	98230	98230	I	349	" Why could n't you come to terms with him?"Hardy
98252	98262	98267	98267	he	1057	" It all got hung up on the bonus . "
98270	98323	98267	98267	he	1057	" When the landowner signs the lease , he usually gets a bonus from the buyer . Sometimes he 's entitled to a pretty substantial one , if the land looks good and there are producing wells nearby . Hut the bonus is always low if the land does n't warrant it . ""And
98330	98334	98336	98338	any sane man	1741	" I guessed . "Bigger
98354	98364	98343	98343	I	349	""I'm sorry he was n't willing to be reasonable . "Hardy
98369	98396	98397	98397	He	1057	" I 'll bide my time . It 'll work out sooner or later . And God knows I 've got enough on my plate already . "
98404	98409	98397	98397	He	1057	" Feel like going home now?""No
98415	98444	98413	98413	I	349	" I broke off as I saw the glint in his blue eyes . I knew exactly why he wanted to go home . Demurely , I said , "
98454	98484	98413	98413	I	349	""Sweetheart , you do n't need to see the rest of the exhibit . I can tell you anything you want to know about rigs - to - reefs . "My
98492	98499	98413	98413	I	349	" So you 're an expert ? "
98519	98523	98524	98524	he	1057	"Ask me anything , "
98540	98551	98528	98528	I	349	" Do the rigs actually do anything to enhance the fish population?""According
98604	98611	98688	98689	the company	2211	" He paused and asked hopefully , "
98614	98652	98688	98689	the company	2211	yet?"I shook my head , staring at the front of his throat , where the skin was smooth and brown and appetizing . I loved the sound of his voice , the thick honey of his accent . "
98668	98672	98663	98663	they	1749	" I asked . "No
98700	98721	98688	98689	the company	2211	""How long does it take for the fish to come to the . . . the structure they leave in the water?""It
98728	98741	98688	98689	the company	2211	" Hardy fingered the edge of the flutter sleeve on my dress . "
98791	98808	98914	98914	Carrington	100	" He leaned closer to me and let his mouth touch the tip of my eyebrow . "
98815	98821	98967	98967	she	1755	chain?"I breathed in his scent . "
98826	98836	98967	98967	she	1755	"His hand came to my elbow , stroking gently . "
98855	98856	98967	98967	she	1755	" "
98859	98913	98914	98914	Carrington	100	" A high , cheerful voice cut in , and I felt a pair of small arms wrap around my waist . It was Liberty 's little sister , Carrington , her pale gold hair hanging in two neat braids . I hugged her and bent to kiss the top of her head . "
98921	98936	98914	98914	Carrington	100	" I said , viewing her miniskirt and clogs . She flushed in pleasure . "
98949	98958	98914	98914	Carrington	100	again?""I do n't know , sweetie . Maybe — "
98959	98966	98967	98967	she	1755	" You 're here with Hardy ? "
98987	99028	98976	98976	She	1755	" Haven , did you know Hardy drove my mama to the hospital the night I was born ? There was a storm , and it was flooding everywhere , and he got us there in an old blue pickup . "I
99035	99044	99031	99031	Hardy	1057	" He 's pretty good at rescuing people . "His
99060	99062	99063	99063	she	1755	"Hardy , "
99082	99090	99076	99076	He	817	" Hi , Liberty . How 's the baby?""Fine
99107	99113	99114	99114	He	1758	" Her green eyes twinkled . "
99123	99125	99114	99114	He	1758	""Liberty , "
99134	99155	99126	99126	Carrington	100	" do you want to come see the piranhas ? There 's a whole big tank of them over there . ""Okay
99157	99163	99126	99126	Carrington	100	" she said , laughing . "
99176	99204	99170	99170	We	1756	"As Liberty left , Gage contemplated Hardy for a moment . Tension strung through the air , until my brother reached out to shake Hardy 's hand . "
99208	99212	99213	99213	I	349	" Gage said . "
99236	99237	99170	99170	We	1756	" "
99240	99275	99170	99170	We	1756	" Hardy said at once . He seemed to be caught somewhat off guard by Gage 's sincerity . It was the first time I had ever seen a trace of awkwardness in him . "
99301	99302	99303	99303	You	349	" "
99314	99318	99303	99303	You	349	" Gage said . "

99364	99369	99370	99370	I	349	" Hey , Gage , "
99373	99388	99370	99370	I	349	" have you seen Jack yet ? He was supposed to he here tonight . ""He
99408	99413	99403	99403	they	1762	"I rolled my eyes . "
99430	99461	99414	99414	You	349	"Just then I heard the ring of a cell phone , and Hardy reached inside his jacket pocket . Glancing at the number , he did a quick double blink . "
99465	99473	99474	99474	I	349	" he said to Gage and me . "
99487	99488	99485	99485	I	349	" "
99493	99498	99485	99485	I	349	" I said immediately . "Thanks
99500	99544	99485	99485	I	349	" Hardy flipped the phone open and moved through the crowd to a door that led to an outside wraparound balcony . Left alone with Gage , I smiled up at him uncertainly , wondering if I was about to get a lecture . "You
99548	99560	99561	99561	You	349	" my brother said , running an appraising gaze over me . "
99565	99579	99580	99580	I	349	"It had been a long time since anyone had said that to me . "
99584	99593	99594	99594	Gage	817	" I admitted , feeling a little sheepish . "

99631	99642	99643	99643	You	349	" Gage said gently . He surprised me by adding , "
99683	99688	99677	99677	I	349	" He smiled wryly . "
99710	99722	99723	99723	Haven	1994	" He slid his hands in his pockets and frowned slightly . "
99754	99755	99748	99748	he	1057	" "
99773	99795	99748	99748	he	1057	" I said , making him grin . I drew a little closer , mindful of the possibility of being overheard . "
99860	99913	99850	99850	I	349	"Hardy returned , and I knew from looking at him that something was terribly wrong . There was no expression on his face , but he was chalk - white under his tan , and he had the distracted tension of a man whose mind was working on a multitude of levels . "Haven
99915	99934	99935	99935	I	349	" The voice , too , was different , as flat and scratchy as a sheet of sandpaper . "
99962	99968	99949	99949	I	349	""Oh , Hardy . . . "
99985	99988	99990	99990	she	315	" Is she okay?""Yeah

100331	100349	100324	100325	Hardy Cates	1057	"CHAPTER EIGHTEENI had asked the concierge to call me when he saw Hardy arrive at 1800 Main . "
100357	100533	100324	100325	Hardy Cates	1057	" I had told him . If he thought that was a little strange , or wondered why I was n't expecting Hardy to call me himself , he did n't say a word . Checking the phone messages , I saw nothing but two hang - ups , both of them from a Dallas number . It had to be Nick . I had cut all ties to the other people I had known in Dallas , the people I 'd worked with at the Darlington , and the people in Nick 's circle who had known me as Marie . Nick was furious with me for rejecting him , for showing no interest in getting Gretchen 's bracelet back . For going on with my life . I hoped that ignoring him would cause him to back off . If he persisted in trying to get in touch with me , I would be forced to do something about it . Maybe a restraining order?Except I remembered Hardy 's cynical comment . . . "
100547	100671	100324	100325	Hardy Cates	1057	"I wondered what Hardy was doing at that moment , what kind of problem he was dealing with . I was sorely tempted to call him , but I figured the last thing he needed was his cell phone ringing while he was in the middle of some difficult situation . So I took a long bath and put on sweatpants and an oversized T - shirt , and I tried to watch TV . I must have clicked through a hundred cable channels , but there was nothing good on . I slept lightly , my ears pricked for any sound . And then it came , the phone giving one shrill ring before I grabbed it and pressed the talk button . "

100855	100874	100851	100851	I	349	" Go to bed . Let him sleep . He 'll call tomorrow when he feels like talking . "But

101712	101777	101708	101709	your mother	2099	for?"Hardy stood with his head lowered . His hair was rumpled as if he 'd tugged at it repeatedly . I wanted to smooth those gleaming dark locks and settle my hand on the taut back of his neck . I longed to soothe him . But all I could do was wait , with a patience that had never been easy for me . "She
101788	101794	101795	101795	He	285	" I heard him say . "

101968	102050	101953	101953	I	349	" He did fifteen years for aggravated rape . He 's a serial rapist . . . godawful things to women . . . never gave him parole , they knew he had n't changed .

104321	104434	104317	104317	Alice	254	"It was ten pages long and filled with accusations and lies . I had felt dirty and tainted after reading it , but most of all , outraged . Nick had recast our entire marriage , with himself as the victim and me as the villain . According to Nick , I had been an insane , histrionic , and unfaithful wife , and he had tried in vain to pacify me and my moods and rages . And in the end , when he had lost his temper with me , it was because I had pushed him to the edge , by rejecting his honest efforts to fix our relationship . "What
104441	104446	104317	104317	Alice	254	" I continued heatedly , "

104763	104830	104831	104831	Susan	148	"There 's no easy answer . But if I were you , I would save this e - mail and document every interaction with him .

106212	106497	106207	106207	T.J	258	"There was no one I could talk to . I had been warned by everyone , including Todd , that this was exactly what I should expect from Hardy Cates . I could n't even call Liberty , because he had done something similar to her once and she could n't say it was out of character . And I felt like such an idiot , because I still loved him . Part of me wanted to curl up into a ball and cry . Another part was ripping mad . And another part was busy analyzing the situation and trying to figure out the best way to handle it . I decided to cool down before I confronted Hardy . I would call him tomorrow after work , and we would talk everything out . If he wanted to break everything off between us , I would deal with it . But at least it would n't be done third - party , by a couple of manipulative old geezers . The office was unusually subdued when I went in at eight on Monday morning . The employees were quiet and busy . No one seemed inclined to share details about their weekend as we usually did . No water - cooler gossip , no friendly chitchat . As lunchtime approached , I went to Samantha 's cubicle to ask if she wanted to go get a sandwich with me . Samantha , usually so vivacious , looked shrunken and despondent as she sat behind her desk . Her father had died about two weeks earlier , so I knew it would take some time before she was back to her old self . "Want
106504	106509	106513	106513	me	349	" I asked gently . "

107500	107573	107493	107493	We	1852	right?"An excruciating silence passed . Silence was one of Vanessa 's more effective weapons . . . she would stare at me until I felt myself collapsing like a tower of blocks , and I 'd say something , anything , to fill the unnerving wordless void . But I held her stare . The silence drew out until it was actually sort of funny . But I managed to outwait her . "You're

107780	107808	107765	107766	Good Lord	269	" But that 's not what we were talking about , is it ? Are you going to give the money back , or should I go to Jack?""You

108249	108281	108247	108247	Jack	0	" she said in surprise . And then she gave him a warm smile , and she looked so poised and pleasant that I was astonished by the change in her . "

Guys hate it when you give us a problem and then do n't let us do something about it . It makes us feel bad .

109457	109581	109585	109585	Marie	1994	" I whispered , closing my eyes briefly . But I opened them right away , because something had caught my attention . A glitter and gleam next to the phone base . Perplexed , I reached out for the object , and was astonished to discover it was a charm bracelet . Aunt Gretchen 's . But how had it gotten there ? It had been in Nick 's possession . Nick — Before I could make a sound , someone came up behind me , and a hand clamped on my neck . The barrel of a handgun pressed cold and hard against the side of my head . I knew who it was even before I heard his gloating voice . "Got

109682	109722	109669	109669	You	1880	"He wanted me to know he was all - powerful . He wanted to prove I could n't beat him . My mouth had gone so dry I could barely talk , while sweat broke out on my face . "

109962	110013	109941	109941	I	349	" I whispered . Maybe he had come here with the sole intention of scaring me . But he was working himself up as he always had , letting his temper build . Once he started getting angry , it was an avalanche . You could n't hold it back . "You

110582	110689	110562	110563	a baby	564	slut!"He used his grip on my hair to drag me down to the floor . His temper had heated to full boil , and he was shouting more filthy words , jamming the gun against my head . My mind , my emotions , disengaged from what was happening , the intimate violence that was coming . Just like before , only now with a gun at my head . I wondered dazedly if he would pull the trigger . His body crushed mine as he used his weight to pin me down . His breath was rank and boozy as he muttered near my ear . "
110700	110943	110562	110563	a baby	564	"I was stiff , all muscles bitterly tensed . I wanted so badly to survive . My mouth flooded with the flavors of salt and metal . The familiar - awful touch of his hand paralyzed me as he started to drag the hem of my skirt up . We were both so absorbed in our savage struggle , one bent on inflicting harm , one resisting body and soul , that neither of us heard the door open . The air vibrated with an inhuman sound , and the entire room exploded , chaos unfolding . I managed to look up , my neck twisting painfully , and a brutal form was rushing toward us , and the gouge of cold metal left my skull as Nick raised the gun and fired . Silence . My ears were temporarily numb , my body resounding with the force of my terrified heartbeat . The smothering weight was gone . I rolled to my side and opened my blurry eyes . Two men were brawling in a pounding , choking , jaw - cracking dogfight , sweat and blood flying . Hardy was on top of Nick , pummeling over and over . I could see the fight draining out of Nick as damage accumulated , bones fracturing , skin rupturing , and still Hardy would n't stop . There was blood everywhere — Hardy 's left side was drenched and welling crimson . "Hardy
110945	110955	110956	110956	Hardy	1057	" I cried out , lurching to my knees . "
110960	111033	111034	111034	Hardy	1057	" He did n't hear me . He had lost his mind , every impulse and thought bent on destruction . He was going to kill Nick . And judging from the rate his own blood was pouring out , he would kill himself in the process . The gun , knocked out of Nick 's hand , had skittered a few yards away . I crawled over and picked it up . "
111051	111090	111049	111049	Hardy	1057	" Nothing I said or did was going to matter . He was on an adrenaline - fueled rampage . I had never seen so much blood . I could n't believe he had n't passed out yet . "Damn
111099	111119	111093	111093	Hardy	1057	" I shouted . He paused and looked over at me , panting . His eyes were slightly unfocused . "
111124	111143	111122	111122	you	1057	" I repeated , staggering to my feet . I went to him and pulled at his arm . "
111153	111172	111122	111122	you	1057	"He resisted , looking down at Nick , who had passed out , his face swollen and battered . "It

111203	111316	111332	111332	he	1057	" I repeated the words several times , coaxing and commanding and hauling him to the sofa . Hardy looked ashen and haggard , his face contorting as the murderous instinct faded and pain began to hit him . He tried to sit , ended up collapsing , his fists suspended in midair . He 'd been shot on his side , but there was so much blood , I could n't see the exact location or extent of the damage . Still holding the gun , I ran to the kitchen and grabbed some folded dishtowels . I set the gun on the coffee table and ripped Hardy 's shirt open . "Haven
111318	111325	111327	111327	he	1057	" he said through thready breaths , "

111342	111415	111338	111338	I	349	" I wiped at the blood and found the wound , a surprisingly small , neat hole . But I could n't see an exit wound , which mean the bullet had gone in and possibly ricocheted , doing damage to the spleen , liver , or kidney . . . I wanted to burst into tears , but I forced them back and placed the pad of dishtowels over the wound . "

Not because you 're not worth loving . Nick just did n't have it in him . But Hardy Cates . . . for all that he 's a rascal and a born redneck . . . I believed him today . He was n't trying to sell me something . He was just telling me like it was . I respected that . And whatever you choose to do about him , I 'll respect that too . "Two

113242	113248	113249	113249	I	349	" I 'm his fiancée . "
113258	113262	113249	113249	I	349	" Haven Travis . ""Dr
113266	113271	113264	113264	Whitfield	263	" We shook hands . "Mr
113283	113288	113273	113273	Cates	1057	" the surgeon said . "
113402	113419	113396	113396	he	1932	"My eyes and nose stung . I passed a sleeve over my eyes to blot them . "
113437	113448	113433	113435	No gimpy spleen	1936	anything?""Oh , no . I 'd expect a full recovery . ""Oh
113453	113487	113488	113488	I	349	" I let out a shuddering sigh . It was one of the best moments of my life . No , the absolute best . I was electrified and weak , and breathless . "
113504	113509	113510	113511	Dr. Whitfield	263	possible?""It 's either relief , "
113515	113527	113510	113511	Dr. Whitfield	263	" or the waiting room coffee . Most likely the coffee . "The
113935	113938	113939	113939	I	349	"Hardy Cates , "
113947	113959	113939	113939	I	349	" you behave , or I 'll step on your tube . "The
114001	114012	114013	114013	he	1057	" That only works if it 's a breathing tube , "
114051	114055	114056	114056	I	349	" Take these , "
114059	114063	114056	114056	I	349	" No arguing . "He
114079	114084	114085	114085	he	1057	" She 's little , "
114089	114095	114085	114085	he	1057	" but she 's mean . "The

114152	114185	114149	114149	he	1057	" get me out of here . I 've never been in a hospital before . I ca n't stand being hooked up to all this crap . All I need is — "
114186	114192	114193	114193	I	349	" Surrender to the process , "
114197	114209	114210	114210	I	349	" and you 'll get out of here a lot quicker . "
114215	114225	114210	114210	I	349	" Will you behave if I get in there with you?"Without
114313	114315	114316	114316	I	349	"Hardy , "
114323	114342	114316	114316	I	349	" why did you take that stupid deal from Dad and T.J. ? And why 'd you call it off?"His
114354	114369	114345	114345	mine	349	" I went a little crazy after I saw my dad on Friday night . ""Really
114376	114430	114431	114431	Hardy	1057	""I bailed him out and dropped him off at a motel with some money . And I told him to get lost . But what I did n't tell you . . . I should have . . . is that he and I talked for a few minutes . And he said — "
114450	114470	114471	114471	Hardy	1057	"He got pissed when I told him what I 'd do to him if he ever called Mom again , "
114474	114547	114471	114471	Hardy	1057	" He said that was funny coming from me , because . . . I was the reason they 'd gotten married . Mom had stopped going out with him , but then she had to go back to him because she was pregnant . It was my fault she ended up with the son of a bitch . Her whole life has been hell because of me . She 's suffered — "
114548	114555	114556	114556	I	349	" No . Hardy . . . "
114573	114589	114567	114567	My	349	" You know that 's not right . You know it was n't your fault . ""But
114620	114688	114615	114615	her	265	"I understood Hardy 's feelings even if I did n't agree with his logic . But his anguish and irrational guilt could n't be solved with convenient platitudes . He needed time , and love , to come to terms with the truth . And I had more than enough of both to give him . Hardy kissed my head . His voice was deep and rough . "
114768	114781	114784	114784	you	1955	"My hand crept up to caress the rigid line of his jaw . "
114789	114793	114794	114794	I	349	" I whispered . "After
114865	114884	114887	114887	I	349	"I flushed as I remembered the long , erotic hours with him in the darkness of his bedroom . "
114900	114909	114891	114891	I	349	" My voice lowered to an abashed whisper . "
114919	114934	114891	114891	I	349	"His body had turned so warm , I wondered if he was blushing too . "
115039	115066	115067	115067	I	349	"I had never heard him so utterly humble , never imagined it was possible . I guided his face to mine until our noses almost touched . "
115085	115098	115100	115100	you	1955	"He kissed me with surprising strength , his mouth warm and demanding . "I
115102	115141	115100	115100	you	1955	" I whispered . And it was a testament to the man 's considerable vigor that in spite of blood loss , drugs , and a distinctly unromantic hospital setting , he put some serious moves on me . "Don't
115143	115160	115161	115161	We	1958	" I said with a shaky laugh as his free hand wandered boldly over my front . "
115180	115195	115170	115170	they	1958	"But Hardy paid no attention , of course , doing exactly as he pleased . "You
115198	115211	115212	115212	I	349	" I said , arching a little as he kissed my neck , "
115233	115243	115244	115244	Hardy	1057	""I'd hate to make a liar out of you . "
115250	115293	115244	115244	Hardy	1057	" But after what happened last night , you 're feeling grateful , and I do n't want to take advantage . So tomorrow , when the gratitude 's worn off . . . I 'll probably ask you to marry me . ""I'll
115298	115323	115244	115244	Hardy	1057	" I told him . Hardy brought my forehead to his , and I was lost in the brilliant blue depths of his eyes . "Soon
115325	115332	115244	115244	Hardy	1057	" he whispered against my lips . "
115339	115394	115244	115244	Hardy	1057	"It occurred to me in retrospect that I probably should have been nervous about getting married again , in light of my past experiences . But everything was different with Hardy . His love came with no strings attached , which I thought was the greatest gift one human being could give to another . "You
115397	115406	115407	115407	I	349	" I told him on our wedding night , "
115425	115444	115407	115407	I	349	"And because Hardy understood what I meant , he pulled me into his arms , against his heart . EPILOGUE"He
115453	115459	115450	115451	Mrs. Cates	267	" Hardy 's secretary says . "
115474	115499	115461	115461	he	349	"I'm at Hardy 's high - rise office on Fannin , an aluminum and glass building that looks like two puzzle pieces put together . "
115502	115767	115461	115461	he	349	" I tell the secretary , and I go to my husband 's door and let myself in . Hardy is at his desk , his suit jacket tossed carelessly over a chair . His tie is loose and his shirt sleeves are rolled up over heavy - muscled forearms , as if he 's tried to make himself more comfortable in the confining business attire . Roughneck , I think , with a pang of possessive pleasure . We've been married for nearly a year , and I still ca n't get used to the fact that he 's mine . It 's nothing like the marriage I had with Nick in any way , shape , or form . Nick is no longer a threat to me or anyone , having been convicted of two counts of aggravated assault and sent to Texarkana . And Vanessa Flint ended up leaving Houston . The last I heard , she was the assistant manager at a fertilizer company in Marfa . I do n't spend much time dwelling on the past . One of the blessings human beings take for granted is the ability to remember pain without re - feeling it . The pain of physical wounds is long gone for both Hardy and me . And the other kind of hurt , the damage done to our spirits , has been healed . We are careful with those scarred places in each other . And we delight in a marriage that the two of us are creating , deepening , every day . "
115792	115818	115783	115783	they	1963	" Hardy says . I bite back a grin , thinking by now I should be used to the filthy - sounding oil business lingo . "
115836	115842	115822	115822	I	349	" Hardy pauses to listen . "
115876	115909	115862	115863	the EPA	1964	" He breaks off as he sees me , and a slow , dazzling smile crosses his face , the one that never fails to make me a little light - headed . "
115916	115923	115862	115863	the EPA	1964	" he says into the phone . "
115931	115961	115962	115965	Brown - eyed girl	1965	"Setting the phone aside , Hardy walks around the desk . He half sits , half leans on the edge , and reaches to pull me between his thighs . "
115967	115974	115962	115965	Brown - eyed girl	1965	" he murmurs , kissing me . "Stimulation
115977	115988	115962	115965	Brown - eyed girl	1965	" I ask , looping my arms around his neck . "Ways
116003	116007	115962	115965	Brown - eyed girl	1965	" he explains . "
116027	116037	115962	115965	Brown - eyed girl	1965	" His hands coast over my sides and hips . "
116048	116055	116038	116038	We	1967	""You could have finished your conversation , "
116060	116069	116056	116056	I	349	"I would n't want you to be bored . ""Not
116087	116096	116097	116097	Hardy	1057	""I do n't know exactly what risqué means , "
116108	116120	116097	116097	Hardy	1057	" but I think I 've done it a few times . "I
116126	116132	116133	116133	I	349	" Suggestive of sexual impropriety , "
116136	116146	116133	116133	I	349	" You 've been risqué your entire adult life . "His
116151	116158	116159	116159	He	349	" But now only with you . "
116171	116182	116159	116159	He	349	" Haven , sweetheart . . . how did the appointment go?"We've
116243	116255	116258	116258	him	349	"The doctor said I 'm perfectly healthy and good to go , "
116260	116269	116256	116256	I	349	" Now the rest is up to you . "He
116276	116280	116256	116256	I	349	" When do we start?""Tonight
116282	116297	116256	116256	I	349	" I tilt my head back languidly as his lips slide along my throat . "How
116300	116310	116315	116315	his	349	hour?""No way . I want mood music and foreplay . "I
116337	116363	116323	116323	he	349	" Haven . . . I do n't know if I 'm going to be a good father . What if I do n't do it right?"I
116478	116491	116492	116492	I	349	"I think the fact that you 're worrying about it at all , "
116495	116505	116492	116492	I	349	" means you 'll probably be great at it . "Hardy
116536	116541	116542	116542	he	1057	" That does it , "
116552	116598	116542	116542	he	1057	" It 's going to be lunch hour for you , honey . Get your purse . We 've got time for foreplay , but not for mood music . Unless you can find something on the car radio on the way to the apartment . "I
116628	116634	116635	116635	I	349	" Who needs mood music ? "
