4568	4588	4560	4560	She	0	“ That ’s nothing . James is twelve years older than I am . Age is just a number . ”
4666	4684	4653	4653	I	0	“ Speaking of the groom , we ’d better get you back there for that first dance . ”

4816	4826	4827	4827	She	0	“ I can find my way , no worries . ”
4833	4862	4827	4827	She	0	“ And I ’d better hurry — those macarons on the dessert table looked divine . I do n’t want them to be gone when I get there . ”
4863	4881	4882	4882	She	0	“ Oh , I made those . I can always get you some extra if they are . ”
4891	4932	4882	4882	She	0	“ You made those ? They ’re beautiful ! And absolutely delicious ! I tasted one when we visited the first time — no joke , they were one of the things that sold me on having the wedding here . ”

5039	5045	5022	5022	She	0	“ No . Just here . ”

5198	5291	5188	5188	I	0	“ Listen , I do n’t have a business card on me right now , but when I get back from Hawaii , I ’m going to send one over to you . I ’m in commercial real estate , and sometimes I invest in local businesses as well — especially those started by female entrepreneurs . If you ever want to talk about this some more , you let me know . It ’ll be my way to show my appreciation for your saving me from eternal embarrassment at my wedding . ”

5676	5681	5646	5646	She	59	“ Okay . Night . ”

6505	6532	6501	6501	she	204	“ And you ’ll be more comfortable and less stressed . I know you feel like you ’d be fine , but why take the risk ? ”

8563	8575	8557	8557	I	0	“ No problem . It ’s there when you need it . ”

9247	9260	9261	9261	Chloe	59	“ I need more coffee . Preferably with some whiskey in it . ”
9264	9287	9261	9261	Chloe	59	“ If we had a distillery on site , I ’d have some for you . Are you having a bad morning ? ”
9288	9316	9123	9123	He	71	“ Kind of . My sitter is out of commission and I need to find a replacement before Winifred gets out of preschool at eleven - thirty . ”
9317	9325	9261	9261	Chloe	59	“ Just have Frannie pick her up . ”

9656	9693	9694	9694	She	43	“ I ’m only scheduled until one , and my mom is working too . We ’re not that busy today . I have some social media stuff to do , but it ’s nothing urgent . ”

9716	9760	9712	9712	I	0	“ I was trying to think of someone else who could help , but not having much luck . I could even run and pick her up and bring her back here so you do n’t have to leave the desk too early . ”
9761	9795	9694	9694	She	43	“ That ’s perfect . I ’ll get her some lunch here , and then we ’ll head back to your house in time to be there when Millie and Felicity get home . ”

10366	10378	10379	10379	He	1505	“ Can I bring you something ? A sandwich ? Soup ? ”
10383	10391	10379	10379	He	1505	“ I ’ll probably work through lunch . ”

10543	10553	10518	10519	my mother	204	“ Did you hear Mrs. Ingersoll broke her leg ? ”
10558	10561	10562	10562	she	204	“ Yes , ”

10701	10710	10689	10689	She	204	“ No . Is this where you live ? ”
10711	10719	10720	10720	She	204	“ Yes . Do you like it ? ”
10723	10731	10732	10732	I	0	“ It ’s like a doll house . ”
10735	10759	10732	10732	I	0	“ It is kind of like a doll house . A little bigger , maybe , but not much . Are you hungry ? “
10762	10763	10764	10764	Me	0	” “
10775	10955	10764	10764	Me	0	” In the kitchen , Winnie and I opened my fridge and took out a big container of chicken noodle soup I ’d made over the weekend . In my tiny pantry , she found some Ritz crackers , and counted out four for each of us while I rinsed and sliced an apple . When everything was ready , we sat at the counter next to each other . While we ate , I asked Winnie about school , about her sisters , and as usual , I snuck in a question or two about her dad . That was how I ’d learned that he was n’t a very good cook and they were used to eating a lot of chicken nuggets and fish sticks for dinner , that he never got mad when Winnie wet the bed , and that he was okay at brushing hair but terrible at styling it . Today I learned that over the weekend , he ’d accidentally turned everyone ’s white socks pink , even his own . I laughed . “
10967	10973	10764	10764	Me	0	” She slurped her soup . “
10979	10994	10764	10764	Me	0	” After lunch , I asked Winnie if she ’d ever had a macaron . “
10999	11023	10764	10764	Me	0	” she asked , wiping her mouth on her sleeve . I gasped in mock horror as I stood , collecting our bowls . “

11041	11048	11028	11028	You	402	” She smiled and asked hopefully , “

11068	11115	11028	11028	You	402	” I carried our dishes to the sink and grabbed the bakery box sitting on the counter . Inside were a few macarons I ’d set aside Saturday when preparing for the Radley wedding . I had hazelnut , white chocolate malt , and rosewater cream . “
11121	11137	11028	11028	You	402	” I set it in front of her and she leaned over to look inside . “

11174	11199	11152	11152	you	402	” I took one from the box and put it on a plate for her , along with a white chocolate malt for me . “

11250	11267	11238	11238	you	402	” She tucked her legs underneath her on the stool and picked up the pink macaron . “
11281	11344	11278	11278	my	0	” I took a tiny bite of the white chocolate malt , thinking again about what Mrs. Radley had said to me Saturday night about my own business . Since then , her offer to discuss the possibility had crossed my mind a hundred times . I hoped she ’d get in touch . Winnie gobbled hers up and licked her fingers . “
11356	11357	11360	11360	they	403	” “
11423	11432	11416	11417	your sisters	408	” She nodded eagerly , her mouth full . “
11443	11444	11436	11436	Sofia	75	” “
11447	11451	11436	11436	Sofia	75	” I said . “
11484	11490	11436	11436	Sofia	75	” Her face lit up . “
11493	12138	11436	11436	Sofia	75	” A few minutes later , she was snuggled up in my white faux fur blanket , her eyes drifting shut almost immediately . I sat at the other end of the couch with my phone and posted a few things on Cloverleigh ’s social media — a graphic on Facebook advertising an upcoming wine dinner that Chloe and Henry DeSantis had organized , a photo on Instagram I ’d snapped of the macarons on the dessert table at the weekend ’s wedding , and a tweet congratulating Mr. and Mrs. Radley along with a picture from their ceremony . Finally , I returned direct messages from a few brides , answering their questions if I could , and forwarding April ’s information if they ’d requested specifics on availability or pricing . I was just finishing up when I got a text from Mack . How ’s it going ? Great . She ’s sound asleep on my couch . I snapped a quick picture of her and sent it to him . Awesome . I ’m jealous . I smiled , imagining him all wrapped up in that fluffy white blanket stretched out on my couch . Then my stomach whooshed — what would it be like to lie with him like that on a cold winter afternoon , his arms around me , snow falling softly outside the windows , the heat between our bodies keeping us warm … Omigod . Stop it . I forced myself to calm down and type something more acceptable . Did you get some lunch ? Not yet . I ’ve got homemade chicken soup if you want some . Come on up . The three dots appeared , and as they faded in and out , I held my breath . I was always offering to make dinner on Thursdays and Fridays when I watched the kids , but he never took me up on the offer , so I figured he ’d turn down lunch , too . That sounds really good , but I ’m swamped . I ’ll heat some up in a container . You can take it with you . You are tempting me … LOL ask my mom how to get up here . I ’ll heat the soup ! It took him a minute to reply , but when he did , he said okay . I almost squealed . He was coming up to my apartment ! He ’d never done that before ! Setting my phone aside , I hurried into the kitchen , ladled some soup into a plastic container , and stuck it in the microwave . Then I ran into the bathroom and looked in the mirror over the sink . I was still wearing my work clothes , a dark green Cloverleigh collared shirt and black pants . Nothing I could do about that now , but I fussed with my hair and put on another coat of mascara . At the last second , I gave one wrist a spritz of perfume and rubbed it against the other . You are tempting me … If only ! God , what I would n’t give to be the kind of woman who could really tempt him . The microwave beeped and I went back to the kitchen , took the soup out , stirred it up , then pressed the lid into place . In a second little container , I placed some crackers and a couple macarons , then tucked everything into a brown paper bag with a spoon and a couple napkins . A minute later , there were three soft knocks at my door , echoed by three hard ones in my chest . Inhaling and exhaling slowly , I put my hand on the knob and pulled . “
12141	12155	11436	11436	Sofia	75	” he said quietly , a sheepish half - grin on his face . “
12165	12180	12158	12158	you	410	” I smiled , positive he could hear my heart thwacking against my ribs . “
12185	12201	12158	12158	you	410	” He entered my suite and glanced around , sticking his hands in his pockets . “
12206	12207	12158	12158	you	410	” “
12232	12239	12219	12219	Winnie	461	” I nodded over my shoulder . “
12242	12277	12280	12280	they	411	” While he wandered toward the couch , I took the brown bag with his lunch in it off the kitchen counter . After a quick look at her , he turned around smiling . “
12288	12289	12280	12280	they	411	” “
12299	12317	12280	12280	they	411	” I handed him the bag , one hand on the bottom , one holding the handles . “
12324	12325	12280	12280	they	411	” “
12328	12341	12342	12342	I	0	” He took it from me , and both our hands touched . “
12346	12347	12342	12342	I	0	” “
12367	12373	12374	12374	You	410	” He shook his head . “
12394	12402	12403	12403	They	342	” I could n’t hide a smile . “
12410	12411	12413	12413	they	342	” “
12415	12419	12413	12413	they	342	” He chuckled . “

12502	12515	12493	12493	I	0	” I followed him to the door . I felt like skipping . “
12528	12529	12524	12524	she	414	” “
12538	12544	12532	12532	God	1400	” He sniffed the bag . “
12570	12574	12575	12575	I	0	” I laughed . “
12580	12613	12575	12575	I	0	” He gave me a rueful , boyish grin that made my insides melt and disappeared down the hall . Twenty minutes later , my heart was still pounding . * * * “
12621	12635	12575	12575	I	0	” my mother asked when Winnie and I came downstairs to say goodbye . “
12643	12662	12638	12638	I	0	” I said airily , watching the little girl dart down the hall toward her dad ’s office . “
12672	12678	12666	12666	you	248	” She crossed her arms . “
12687	12719	12722	12723	the bride	204	” I could hardly tell her how happy it had made me to pack a lunch for Mack , so I decided to confide in her about Mrs. Radley ’s suggestion . “
12735	12746	12728	12728	She	204	” Thirty seconds into the story , I was sorry . “
12754	12780	12752	12752	Frannie	248	” my mother fretted , shaking her head . Then she hurled a million questions at me without giving me a chance to answer them . “
12794	12795	12796	12796	I	0	” “
12799	12800	12796	12796	I	0	” “

12833	12837	12829	12829	I	0	” I bristled . “
12861	12862	12853	12853	your	248	” “
12877	12882	12875	12875	Mom	73	” I said testily . “
12912	12917	12903	12903	I	0	” She looked offended . “
12924	12925	12903	12903	I	0	” “

13003	13021	12993	12993	I	0	” She looked around to make sure no guests heard me shout , then lifted her chin . “

13054	13055	13044	13044	your	248	” “
13064	13073	13044	13044	your	248	” she said , her eyes welling up . “
13094	13111	13086	13086	You	248	” I groaned , holding up one hand and pulling open the door with the other . “
13130	13368	13369	13369	Daddy	36	” Simmering with anger , I moved down the hall toward Mack ’s office . Mack I devoured the lunch Frannie had packed for me — every last cracker crumb , drop of soup , and sugary bite of whatever kind of cookie that was . I ’d never tasted anything so fancy and delicious . In fact , when I was done , I kept looking in that empty brown bag , hoping for more to magically appear . I ’d pay her extra this week , so I would n’t feel like I was taking advantage of her kindness . Normally I ’d have refused her offer to pack me a lunch , but it was such a cold day and homemade chicken soup had sounded so good . When was the last time I ’d eaten soup that had n’t come from a can ? Carla had n’t been much of a cook even before things fell apart with us , but she ’d been better than me . Which was n’t saying much . I glanced at the photo of the girls on my desk and fought off the quick stab of guilt , always sharpest when I worried I had n’t done enough to fix the marriage , had n’t tried hard enough to make it work for the sake of the kids . It was a constant knife in my heart . “
13371	13388	13369	13369	Daddy	36	” I looked up to see Winifred darting into my office , dressed to go outside . “
13400	13401	13369	13369	Daddy	36	” “
13404	13443	13369	13369	Daddy	36	” She climbed onto my lap and looped her arms around my neck , telling me all about the lunch they ’d made , the cookies they were going to bake this afternoon , and napping on Frannie ’s “
13447	13498	13369	13369	Daddy	36	” She was still rambling when Frannie appeared in the doorway wearing snow boots , a puffy white winter coat and a burgundy hat with a furry ball on top of it . It was adorable on her . I wished she ’d come and sit on my lap too . “
13508	13526	13369	13369	Daddy	36	” Frannie explained , tugging on her gloves . She did n’t sound too happy about it . “
13544	13545	13539	13539	she	204	” “
13550	13557	13539	13539	she	204	” But her expression remained tense . “
13564	13572	13539	13539	she	204	” She sighed , shaking her head . “
13580	13581	13584	13584	mine	0	” “
13595	13610	13587	13587	They	424	” I wanted to cheer her up a little , she looked so down . “
13623	13631	13632	13632	You	204	” Her features eased into a smile . “
13665	13672	13658	13658	I	0	” I looked down at Winnie . “
13686	13694	13679	13679	I	0	” She giggled and shook her head . “
13698	13702	13679	13679	I	0	” I sighed . “
13720	13721	13714	13714	I	0	” “
13731	13745	13746	13746	Macarons	158	” Winnie announced . Frannie laughed and stuck her hands on her hips . “
13766	13772	13763	13763	your	204	” she said to me . “
13778	13779	13774	13774	you	204	” “
13807	13808	13815	13815	they	158	” “
13824	13831	13832	13832	they	158	” she added with a smile , “
13838	13839	13832	13832	they	158	” “
13856	13867	13846	13846	you	204	” I asked her , genuinely curious . She shrugged . “
13912	13913	13882	13882	She	274	” “
13920	13946	13947	13947	You	204	” I glanced out the one window in my office . Snowflakes continued to fall lightly , but it was supposed to get heavier tonight . “
13962	13963	13965	13965	you	204	” “
13977	13981	13982	13982	I	0	” she asked . “
13989	14010	13982	13982	I	0	” I ’d like to give you eight to ten inches tonight , I thought . What I said was , “
14040	14041	14033	14033	You	204	” “
14064	14065	14050	14051	My dad	216	” “
14069	14111	14112	14112	Dad	216	” said a gruff male voice . I looked up to see John Sawyer ’s tall , thick frame appear in the hallway behind Frannie . He put an arm around his daughter ’s neck , getting her in a headlock . “
14114	14123	14112	14112	Dad	216	” she complained , pulling at his arm . “
14127	14128	14112	14112	Dad	216	” “
14131	14144	14112	14112	Dad	216	” He kept her there and looked over her shoulder at me . “
14154	14170	14112	14112	Dad	216	” I nodded , kissed Winnie ’s head and pushed her gently from my lap . “
14184	14191	14178	14178	I	0	” To Sawyer , I said , “
14206	14207	14208	14208	She	1434	” “
14214	14222	14208	14208	She	1434	” said Sawyer , squeezing her tightly . “
14237	14245	14246	14246	You	80	” Sawyer laughed as he released her . “
14271	14272	14276	14276	her	1434	” “
14279	14283	14284	14284	Millie	37	” I offered . “
14304	14348	14352	14352	you	80	” Sawyer hitched up his jeans and leaned down to talk to Winnie , hands on his knees . He never wore dress clothes to work — said he was a farmer more than anything else and was happiest outside in the dirt . “
14356	14357	14352	14352	you	80	” “
14360	14361	14352	14352	you	80	” “
14366	14367	14368	14368	I	0	” “
14372	14377	14368	14368	I	0	” she told him . “
14398	14402	14408	14408	Sawyer	248	” I groaned . “
14418	14419	14410	14410	I	0	” “
14436	14440	14410	14410	I	0	” offered Frannie . “
14448	14452	14410	14410	I	0	” I asked . “
14459	14472	14410	14410	I	0	” she said , giving her dad a poke on the shoulder . “
14504	14505	14500	14500	you	80	” “
14508	14512	14500	14500	you	80	” Winifred exclaimed . “
14528	14532	14500	14500	you	80	” Sawyer said . “
14542	14543	14544	14544	Dad	216	” “
14546	14551	14544	14544	Dad	216	” Frannie was outraged . “
14574	14575	14576	14576	Fun	81	” “
14585	14594	14576	14576	Fun	81	” She rolled her eyes at her father . “
14607	14617	14605	14605	Jeez	204	” Sawyer looked at me and shook his head . “
14664	14668	14669	14669	Frannie	248	” I laughed . “
14697	14709	14713	14713	Winnie	461	” Frannie clucked her tongue and reached for Winifred ’s hand . “
14724	14725	14715	14715	We	448	” “
14728	14739	14715	14715	We	448	” I called as they walked out hand in hand . “
14743	15242	15249	15249	asshole	450	” Over her shoulder , Frannie stuck her tongue out at me . But then she winked , and my chest felt tight . Sawyer came toward me and sat down in one of the chairs across from my desk , launching into his financial concerns about purchasing the new bottling lines and wondering what I thought about Chloe ’s distillery idea , then complaining about how his wife was always nagging at him to slow down and consider retirement . I heard him , but in all honesty my thoughts were on Frannie . Was she okay driving in this snow ? Was the house clean enough that I would n’t be embarrassed ? Had I left any piles of my underwear folded on the dining room table ? As the afternoon hours dragged by , the snow falling faster and heavier , I kept wondering what everyone was doing . Had the girls finished their homework ? Had Millie practiced piano ? Had Felicity conned her way into more iPad time ? Around four thirty , I got a text from Frannie . Making dinner and dessert . A few seconds later , the message was followed by a series of pictures showing each of the girls in the kitchen , sleeves rolled up , hair tied back , grins on their faces , hands busy with kitchen tools . Apparently , I owned a mixer . Then there was one photo showing something simmering in a big pot on the stove — was it chili ? Just looking at it warmed my belly . Wow . Is that really happening in my kitchen ? It is ! And your girls are doing all the work . Almost . :) I did n’t want to be at work anymore . I wanted to be home with them , hanging out in the kitchen and smelling that chili , drinking a beer and listening to my daughters laugh . We never had fun like that on school nights , which always felt to me like a list of things to tick off — homework , dinner , piano , reading , baths , bed . Piano on Tuesdays . Therapy every other Wednesday . Ballet on Thursdays . Homework done ? I asked , feeling a bit like a curmudgeon . Yes . And Millie says to tell you she practiced piano already , and Felicity wants you to know she read two chapters in her book . Sounds like you have everything under control . Was the driving bad ? Roads were slippery . I went slow . Be careful ! ! I assured her I would and tried to get a few more things done at my desk , but found it hard to concentrate . I was about to call it a day when my phone vibrated . Ryan Woods calling , it said on the screen . I smiled and picked it up . “
15251	15255	15249	15249	asshole	450	” Woods laughed . “
15261	15262	15263	15263	I	0	” “
15275	15276	15263	15263	I	0	” “
15288	15289	15285	15285	I	0	” “
15297	15298	15285	15285	I	0	” “
15306	15310	15303	15303	I	0	” I laughed . “
15313	15486	15303	15303	I	0	” Woods was a buddy from the Marines , although by now he was like a brother to me . We ’d been deployed together in Afghanistan and had remained tight . Like me , he ’d struggled to adjust to his old life once he got back for good , and I got him a job at Cloverleigh as well as a place to live . The house had been a mess before he moved in and refurbished it . Despite being busy , he ’d found time to fall in love with Stella Devine , the granddaughter of Mrs. Gardner next door . She ’d come up from Detroit for a visit , Woods had taken one look at her and that was that . When he moved down to Detroit to be with her , the girls and I moved into the house . He and Stella were getting married at Cloverleigh in a few weeks . I was the best man . Hopefully I would n’t jinx him . “
15494	15498	15303	15303	I	0	” I asked . “
15511	15512	15303	15303	I	0	” “
15515	15520	15303	15303	I	0	” he said emphatically . “
15579	15580	15572	15572	we	452	” “
15583	15587	15572	15572	we	452	” I said . “
15613	15614	15615	15615	Me	0	” “
15618	15624	15615	15615	Me	0	” He lowered his voice . “
15647	15651	15644	15644	Jesus	74	” I laughed . “
15656	15657	15652	15652	I	0	” “
15715	15716	15706	15706	Stella	83	” “
15732	15736	15730	15730	she	0	” He laughed . “
15740	15741	15742	15742	I	0	” “
15756	15761	15747	15747	We	452	” I told him . “
15769	15770	15747	15747	We	452	” “
15796	15826	15792	15792	I	0	” We hung up , and I packed it in for the night . Up at reception , I said goodbye to Frannie ’s mom , who looked anxious . “
15833	15842	15830	15830	you	459	” she said , knotting her hands together . “
15873	15874	15878	15878	her	248	” “
15883	15888	15881	15881	Daphne	86	” I assured her . “
15893	15894	15881	15881	Daphne	86	” “
15897	15904	15905	15905	I	0	” She glanced over her shoulder . “
15927	15928	15918	15918	his	384	” “
15949	15955	15958	15958	Mack	1505	” She smiled in relief . “
15971	15972	15973	15973	I	0	” “
15981	16187	16188	16188	Daddy	36	” But as I hurried out to the parking lot and impatiently brushed off my car , I realized it was n’t only my daughters I was so eager to get home and see — it was her daughter too . Mack The blizzard was in full force . The roads were awful , and traffic crawled . Normally , the ride between my house and Cloverleigh was only about fifteen minutes , but today it took nearly two white - knuckled , curse - muttering hours . Not only did the snow and ice slow me down , but twice I had to pull over and help out other drivers . One lady had gotten herself stuck in a ditch , and some guy had spun out onto the shoulder trying to take a curve too quickly . By the time I pulled into the garage at the back of the property where we lived , Frannie ’s little Volkswagen was pretty well buried at the curb , and I was tense and irritated and starving . But the moment I stepped through the back door , the smell took the edge off my mood . My stomach rumbled with anticipation as I inhaled . “
16190	16199	16200	16200	You	36	” Felicity shouted , running over to me . “
16204	16285	16286	16286	I	0	” She wrapped her arms around my waist and squeezed . I hugged her back without telling her to wait so I could take off my coat and boots and gloves , even though I was getting snow on the floor . Whenever I was late , the girls reacted this way , and I often wondered if part of it was worry I might not come home — if I ’d abandon them the way their mother essentially had . “
16298	16299	16300	16300	We	465	” “
16304	16316	16300	16300	We	465	” Felicity looked up at me and gave me a smile . “
16320	16321	16322	16322	Macarons	158	” “
16324	16335	16322	16322	Macarons	158	” said Frannie from the stove with exaggerated French pronunciation . “
16356	16395	16346	16346	I	0	” From the way the girls all giggled at once , which was my favorite sound in the world , I got the feeling it was already some kind of joke between them . My mood lifted further . “
16413	16422	16346	16346	I	0	” Felicity pressed her ear to my stomach . “
16430	16438	16426	16426	You	466	” Then she looked over at Frannie . “
16450	16463	16426	16426	You	466	” Frannie burst out laughing while I considered strangling my middle child . “
16479	16485	16469	16469	I	0	” She shook her head . “
16488	16489	16469	16469	I	0	” “
16511	16512	16505	16505	I	0	” “
16515	16597	16600	16600	Daddy	36	” I yanked off my boots and left them on the back hall rug next to four other pairs , tossed my gloves and hat on the little bench near the door , and hung up my coat . While I was out of sight , I ran my fingers through my hair , attempting to repair the damage done by wearing a hat for two hours . When I stepped into the kitchen , Winnie was there wanting a hug . “
16602	16603	16600	16600	Daddy	36	” “
16613	16674	16600	16600	Daddy	36	” I picked her up , squeezing her against my chest . Over her shoulder , I surveyed the scene in disbelief . The kitchen was definitely cleaner than I ’d left it this morning . No one was looking at a screen . A platter of pale yellow macarons was on the kitchen counter , where Millie was sitting . “
16680	16689	16691	16691	they	468	” she told me , her mouth full . “
16702	16703	16704	16704	I	0	” “
16709	16715	16716	16716	Winnie	461	” I asked , surprised . “
16728	16742	16716	16716	Winnie	461	” said Frannie as she stirred the chili . My stomach growled again . “
16753	16754	16716	16716	Winnie	461	” “
16761	16776	16777	16777	Daddy	36	” She winked at me over one shoulder , making my nether regions tingle . “
16787	16795	16777	16777	Daddy	36	” Winnie asked , making Frannie laugh . “
16799	16807	16777	16777	Daddy	36	” I said , setting her down . “
16814	16822	16808	16808	You	0	” Millie nodded , rolling her eyes . “
16833	16857	16808	16808	You	0	” Frannie ’s back was to me , and I watched , a little starstruck , as she ladled chili into a bowl . “
16869	16892	16808	16808	You	0	” I asked . She turned to face me , a smile on her face and a steaming bowl in her hands . “
16900	16901	16808	16808	You	0	” “
16908	16928	16808	16808	You	0	” Taking it from her , I went around the counter and slid onto the seat next to Millie . “
16937	16977	16808	16808	You	0	” Frannie asked , setting a napkin and spoon in front of me . What I really wanted was a beer , but I thought I ’d better not since I was going to have to drive her home . “
16988	16996	16983	16983	I	0	” I started to get up again . “
17004	17012	16983	16983	I	0	” She gave me a sympathetic look . “
17026	17027	16983	16983	I	0	” “
17031	17089	17090	17090	I	0	” Forgetting how hungry I was for a moment , I watched her take a glass from the cupboard and fill it , looking perfectly at home in our kitchen . She set the water in front of me as Winnie and Felicity bounced around the kitchen , telling me about all the cooking they ’d done . “
17099	17104	17090	17090	I	0	” Felicity said proudly . “
17113	17114	17090	17090	I	0	” “
17120	17124	17115	17115	I	0	” announced Winnie . “
17127	17131	17115	17115	I	0	” corrected Frannie . “
17157	17165	17170	17170	Millie	37	” Millie said , her expression guilty . “
17172	17189	17170	17170	Millie	37	” Frannie leaned her elbows on the counter across from us and smiled at my oldest . “
17238	17325	17326	17326	Daddy	36	” She ’d changed out of her work shirt and was wearing a loose - fitting gray top that sort of fell off one shoulder , revealing something white and lacy underneath . Quickly , I dropped my eyes to my food and concentrated on eating . In fact , I scarfed down the first bowl of chili Frannie had given me so fast I burned my tongue , but I did n’t care . It was hot and delicious , thick with chicken and vegetables . “
17334	17344	17345	17345	Frannie	248	” Millie asked , hopping down from her chair . “
17360	17367	17345	17345	Frannie	248	” I nodded to the girls . “
17372	17414	17415	17415	God	1400	” The kids wandered into the front room and turned on the TV while I scraped the bottom of my bowl . When every last bite was gone , I set down my spoon and put my hands on my stomach . “
17421	17422	17415	17415	God	1400	” “
17427	17431	17415	17415	God	1400	” Frannie offered . “
17434	17451	17415	17415	God	1400	” Grabbing my empty bowl , I slid off my chair and went around the counter . “
17463	17464	17457	17457	I	0	” “
17476	17499	17457	17457	I	0	” she said as I moved past her to the stove , taking care not to let my body brush against hers . “
17507	17524	17500	17500	I	0	” I took the top off the pot of chili and scooped more into my bowl . “
17555	17594	17531	17531	I	0	” Although the last thing I wanted to do was hit the roads again . I ’d have to take the girls with me , since the blizzard made the drive time too long to leave them alone . “
17625	17647	17605	17605	My	0	” I put the top back on the pot and moved around her again , taking my chair at the counter . “
17665	17675	17676	17676	Chloe	59	” She shrugged and leaned on the counter again . “
17717	17718	17708	17708	I	0	” “
17748	17756	17740	17740	you	473	” Her eyes dropped to her hands . “
17760	17761	17740	17740	you	473	” “
17764	17772	17773	17773	I	0	” She did n’t answer right away . “
17811	17812	17803	17803	I	0	” “
17825	17830	17803	17803	I	0	” I told her . “
17833	17849	17803	17803	I	0	” She looked up and smiled softly , making my heart skip a few beats . “
17852	17853	17803	17803	I	0	” “
17863	17870	17856	17856	I	0	” she said with a sigh . “
17881	17882	17856	17856	I	0	” “
17885	17902	17856	17856	I	0	” She straightened up and leaned back against the island , rolling her eyes a little . “
17946	17947	17939	17939	she	204	” “
17953	17976	17978	17978	you	484	” I said , realizing there were probably a lot of things about her I did n’t know , and wanted to . “
17982	17983	17978	17978	you	484	” “
18036	18052	18054	18055	a father	488	” Placing my spoon in the empty bowl , I carried it to the sink . “
18079	18080	18083	18083	I	0	” “
18089	18093	18086	18087	a baby	492	” she snapped . “
18105	18124	18086	18087	a baby	492	” I turned around and looked at her in surprise . I ’d never heard her speak angrily . “
18200	18206	18191	18191	We	495	” She took a breath . “
18263	18324	18327	18327	you	248	” What I knew right then was how good she looked standing in my kitchen , feisty and worked up , a little color in her cheeks , a little skin showing where her top had slipped off that shoulder . I wanted to bite it . I leaned back against the sink , gripping the edge of the counter . “
18329	18330	18331	18331	I	0	” “
18342	18349	18331	18331	I	0	” She took a step closer . “
18364	18579	18331	18331	I	0	” Talk about mistakes . In two strides I could have covered the distance between us . Taken her in my arms . Crushed my lips to hers and felt her chest pressing against mine . But I would n’t do it . Maybe she was n’t a baby , but she was only twenty - seven — ten whole years younger than I was . She was the boss ’s daughter . She was the nanny . She was here doing me a favor . And she trusted me . There was no way . Frannie I was holding my breath . I was n’t even sure why , but it was something about the way Mack was looking at me . And the tension in his body — the taut muscles in his neck . The grip of his fingers on the edge of the counter . The set of his jaw . It gave the impression of restraint . Like he was holding himself back . Something unfamiliar hummed in the air between us . I could feel it — he wanted me the way I wanted him . No wonder I could n’t breathe . Then he cleared his throat and turned away from me , cutting off the current . “
18591	18696	18582	18582	Everybody	502	” I ’d forgotten I ’d even asked the question . He turned the sink on , rinsed his dishes , and placed them in the dishwasher . I stood there staring at his muscular back , at the width of his shoulders , at the snug fit of his jeans on his butt . If I were his and he was mine , I ’d go over and wrap my arms around his waist , press my cheek to his back . Then he ’d turn around , winding his arms around me . He ’d lower his lips to mine , and — “
18703	18711	18697	18697	I	0	” he said , interrupting my fantasy . “
18718	18719	18697	18697	I	0	” “
18722	18759	18697	18697	I	0	” But I did n’t really want to leave . I wanted to stay in this warm , chaotic house with him and the girls . Pretend I belonged here . Pretend I belonged to him . “
18770	18774	18697	18697	I	0	” I asked . “
18784	18785	18697	18697	I	0	” “
18796	18797	18788	18788	I	0	” “
18811	18829	18800	18800	they	158	” He went over to the back door and pulled on his boots , leaving them unlaced . “
18847	18848	18840	18840	I	0	” “
18851	18886	18840	18840	I	0	” I went into the front room and rounded up the kids , and we were zipping up our coats when Mack came in the back door again , a frown on his face . “
18897	18906	18912	18912	Daddy	36	” One of the girls clucked her tongue . “
18914	18920	18912	18912	Daddy	36	” He glared at them . “
18930	18931	18934	18935	the battery	507	” “
18937	18947	18934	18935	the battery	507	” I asked , pausing with one glove on . “
18976	18977	18981	18981	my	0	” “
19022	19027	19028	19028	I	0	” His brow furrowed . “
19068	19069	19244	19244	Dad	216	” “
19075	19158	19244	19244	Dad	216	” I admitted . My Beetle was adorable and fun in the summer , but every winter I regretted not choosing something bigger and better in the snow . Mack sighed , rubbing the back of his neck . Snowflakes were melting on his shoulders , scarf , and hair — he’d gone out without his hat . The tips of his ears were red from the cold . As we were standing there , the phone rang , and Millie whooped . “
19168	19181	19244	19244	Dad	216	” Felicity made it to the phone first and picked it up . “
19184	19195	19244	19244	Dad	216	” Then she nodded excitedly and did a little dance . “
19203	19221	19244	19244	Dad	216	” While the girls cheered , Mack looked at me over their heads , his expression grim . “
19227	19235	19244	19244	Dad	216	” I laughed , shaking my head . “
19242	19243	19244	19244	Dad	216	” “
19252	19256	19257	19257	She	248	” Millie asked . “
19264	19272	19257	19257	She	248	” shouted Winnie , clapping her hands . “
19282	19286	19273	19273	She	248	” said Millie . “
19292	19293	19287	19287	You	0	” “
19297	19298	19287	19287	You	0	” “

19322	19329	19330	19330	I	0	” Mack put out his hands . “
19335	19336	19330	19330	I	0	” “
19347	19361	19362	19362	I	0	” Felicity clasped her hands beneath her chin . He looked at me . “
19382	19383	19369	19369	I	0	” “
19401	19431	19433	19433	she	274	” I rolled my eyes , thinking that at twenty - seven , it should n’t have been necessary and probably made me sound even more like a child . “
19438	19439	19433	19433	she	274	” “
19444	19448	19449	19449	Yay	88	” he said . “
19473	19485	19462	19462	Frannie	248	” Millie danced around the island . He unwound his scarf . “
19502	19632	19494	19494	I	0	” My heart was thumping hard as the girls crowded around me . Which was silly — I was n’t staying because he wanted me to . I was stuck here . Still . We were going to sleep under the same roof . It gave me a thrill I had n’t felt in a long time . Was that pathetic ? I removed my coat and boots and took my phone out of my purse to text my mom . Going to stay at Mack ’s house . His car wo n’t start and mine is buried on the street . She called me immediately , and I imagined she ’d been waiting nervously with her phone in her hand . Gritting my teeth , I answered it . “
19635	19649	19494	19494	I	0	” I moved into the dining room , where it was less noisy . “
19661	19667	19655	19655	I	0	” she asked right away . “
19674	19704	19705	19705	I	0	” I glanced up and saw Mack pull a beer from the fridge , then hold it up as if to say , You want one ? I nodded . “
19710	19711	19705	19705	I	0	” “
19716	19717	19713	19713	you	520	” “
19758	19759	19751	19751	his	523	” “
19764	19768	19769	19769	I	0	” she conceded . “
19796	19806	19785	19785	Mack	1505	” Mack and I. That was fun to say . “
19816	19817	19807	19807	We	526	” “
19827	19828	19829	19829	We	526	” “
19832	19833	19836	19836	dear	520	” “
19838	19839	19836	19836	dear	520	” “
19843	19890	19836	19836	dear	520	” I wandered back into the kitchen , where the girls were putting a bag of popcorn in the microwave . After I tucked my phone into my bag , Mack handed me a beer . I took it , and he clinked his against mine . “
19893	19894	19895	19895	I	0	” “
19916	19942	19911	19911	we	526	” As soon as I said it , I was embarrassed because it sounded kind of like I thought we ’d be sleeping in together . “
19945	19952	19911	19911	we	526	” he said with a grin . “
19974	19975	19976	19976	Daddy	36	” “
19984	19996	19976	19976	Daddy	36	” Felicity asked . He took a pull on his beer . “
20000	20001	19976	19976	Daddy	36	” “
20005	20009	19976	19976	Daddy	36	” Millie groaned . “
20027	20028	20022	20022	her	530	” “
20034	20038	20022	20022	her	530	” he asked . “
20047	20051	20044	20044	I	0	” Millie answered , “
20067	20074	20063	20063	her	530	” They all looked at me . “
20077	20083	20063	20063	her	530	” I bit my lip . “
20096	20097	20091	20094	The Wizard of Oz	532	” “
20106	20113	20098	20098	Winnie	461	” Felicity said with a snicker . “
20120	20125	20126	20127	That witch	533	” Winnie confirmed dolefully . “
20131	20132	20126	20127	That witch	533	” “
20147	20151	20126	20127	That witch	533	” I suggested . “
20162	20166	20126	20127	That witch	533	” She beamed . “
20169	20221	20126	20127	That witch	533	” With that settled , the girls dumped popcorn into bowls and poured themselves some lemonade . Mack went into the living room to see if he could find the movie on demand , and I put the leftover chili into a large plastic container and stuck it in the fridge . “
20225	20266	20126	20127	That witch	533	” he called a moment later . The girls all shouted with excitement , and we carried the snacks into the living room . Right away , Winnie hopped up on one end of the L - shaped sectional couch . “
20270	20366	20367	20367	Girls	1391	” she directed , patting the cushion next to her . I did as she asked , briefly wondering where Mack would end up and if it was too much to hope for that he might sit next to me . Turns out he had no choice , because Millie stretched out on the floor with a big pillow and Felicity lay down along the shorter section of the couch . That left only one place open , right next to me . He glanced at it as the opening credits to the movie began . “
20369	20373	20367	20367	Girls	1391	” he said , “
20391	20392	20386	20387	Mrs. Gardner	43	” “
20395	20399	20386	20387	Mrs. Gardner	43	” they chimed . “
20411	20507	20401	20401	Dad	216	” Millie called , making herself more comfy on the floor . He saluted her , switched off both living room lamps , and headed for the kitchen . From my spot on the couch , I watched him set his beer on the island and step into the back hall . He was gone for about ten minutes , and when he came back , he was carrying a plate covered with foil . After taking off his winter stuff , he picked up his beer and brought the plate into the living room . “
20513	20514	20401	20401	Dad	216	” “
20517	20521	20522	20522	Me	0	” said Felicity . “
20524	20525	20527	20527	me	0	” “
20529	20538	20527	20527	me	0	” said Millie , popping to her feet . “
20548	20549	20540	20540	they	536	” “
20558	20563	20565	20565	she	0	” I assured her . “
20570	20585	20565	20565	she	0	” Mack nodded and set the plate on the end table next to Winnie . “
20598	20622	20588	20588	I	0	” Then he dropped onto the cushion adjacent to mine , and I thought I might die . But I played it cool . “
20642	20643	20645	20645	you	537	” “
20650	20710	20645	20645	you	537	” Reaching behind me , he took a thick , crocheted blanket off the back of the couch and set it in my lap . I was n’t that cold — actually my body was heating up with him so close — but I could n’t resist the idea of sitting beneath a blanket with him in the dark . “
20719	20745	20715	20715	I	0	” Unfolding the heavy knit throw , I spread one end over Winnie ’s folded legs and gently tossed the other onto Mack ’s lap . “
20753	20757	20758	20758	Me	0	” Felicity whined . “
20761	20810	20758	20758	Me	0	” said Millie . Mack grumbled but set down his beer and got up again . He disappeared up the stairs and came down a moment later with two fleece blankets . After dropping one onto Millie , he shook out the other and draped it over Felicity . “
20818	20819	20814	20814	I	0	” “
20822	20943	20814	20814	I	0	” Millie admonished . Mack nudged her ribs with his foot before taking his seat next to me once more , and if I was n’t crazy , it felt like he sat a little closer this time . I could totally feel the length of his thigh alongside mine beneath the blanket . We watched the movie and sipped our beers while the kids munched popcorn and slurped lemonade . At one point , Millie wanted more snacks , Felicity needed a bathroom break , and Winnie wanted a stuffed animal , so we hit pause . All three girls got up and took off in various directions , leaving Mack and me alone in the dim living room . “
20947	21023	20814	20814	I	0	” he asked , rising to his feet . I hesitated . I was kind of a lightweight , and I did n’t want to get goofy . I wanted him to see me as an adult and not a kid , so getting tipsy would n’t help . That said , I was so aware of his body next to mine that I was having trouble relaxing . One more beer could n’t hurt . “
21026	21027	20814	20814	I	0	” “
21055	21062	21063	21063	You	538	” I smiled up at him . “
21070	21071	21063	21063	You	538	” “
21076	21103	21106	21106	Jesus	74	” He looked toward the kitchen , where someone had turned on the light and an argument had begun over how much time the popcorn needed . “
21114	21240	21108	21108	I	0	” While he was gone , I grabbed my purse and darted upstairs to use the bathroom , blinking at the bright light . In the mirror over the sink , I checked my reflection , trying to imagine what he saw when he looked at me . A kid ? A co - worker ? An employee ? How could I get him to see me differently ? Give it up , I told my reflection . Then I dug my birth control pills out of my purse and took one for today , turned off the light and returned to the living room , where Mack was already sitting on the couch . The girls were still making a racket in the kitchen . “
21245	21254	21242	21242	you	540	” he said , handing me another beer . “
21257	21330	21242	21242	you	540	” I took the bottle and settled onto the couch again , sitting with my legs criss - crossed beneath the blanket this time . I had n’t done it on purpose , not exactly , but my left knee now rested on his right thigh , and he did n’t move away . My pulse picked up . Mack ’s eyes were on the kitchen as he tipped up his beer . “
21347	21348	21336	21336	I	0	” “
21359	21365	21353	21353	You	540	” He took another sip . “
21405	21426	21428	21428	anyone	164	” The confession touched me , and his insecurity squeezed my heart . I put a hand on his arm . “
21461	21462	21463	21463	You	540	” “
21466	21474	21463	21463	You	540	” He looked at me in surprise . “
21532	21538	21539	21539	You	540	” He shook his head . “
21573	21574	21577	21577	I	0	” “
21580	21591	21577	21577	I	0	” I asked , surprised and flattered by his words . “
21598	21635	21577	21577	I	0	” I stared at the label on the beer bottle . Those were all nice things , and I was glad he thought them of me , but none of them were very exciting or sexy . “
21638	21639	21577	21577	I	0	” “
21646	21654	21641	21641	I	0	” Embarrassed , I laughed a little . “
21668	21669	21657	21657	I	0	” “
21676	21677	21657	21657	I	0	” “
21682	21688	21657	21657	I	0	” I took a drink . “
21701	21702	21691	21691	I	0	” “
21713	21714	21708	21708	You	540	” “
21773	21785	21766	21766	I	0	” Mack was silent for a minute . Sipped his beer . “
21807	21835	21836	21836	We	549	” I took a breath and was about to answer when the light in the kitchen went out and the girls trooped back into the living room . “
21840	21864	21865	21865	Felicity	38	” Felicity said , hopping back on the couch with her bowl , spilling popcorn onto the cushions and floor . Mack groaned . “
21873	21874	21865	21865	Felicity	38	” “
21877	21893	21865	21865	Felicity	38	” she said , picking up the pieces and putting them back in her bowl . “
21903	22256	21865	21865	Felicity	38	” He got up and took care of the pieces on the carpet , taking them to the kitchen to throw away while Winifred and Millie settled in again and someone hit play on the movie . I had to laugh a little , imagining that this was probably what a typical Saturday night looked like around here — a movie , some blankets , some popcorn and lemonade . A little bickering , a little mess here and there , a couple beers for Mack after a long week of being CFO and Daddy . It seemed cozy and comforting to me , but that was from the outside . Was he happy ? I wondered , maybe for the first time . I spent tons of time fantasizing about him , but I really did n’t know him , not intimately . Was he lonely ? Did he feel like he was living his life to the fullest , or was that some stupid idea that only someone in my situation worried about ? After all , what choice did he have ? His children were entirely dependent on him for everything from where they slept to what they wore to what they ate to how they felt about themselves . He was 100 percent responsible for their physical and emotional health . He did n’t have the luxury of wondering , Gee , am I living my best life ? I felt silly for saying something so frivolous to him while at the same time admiring his devotion to his children . By his own admission , he was n’t perfect , but he was here , he was trying , and he loved them with his whole heart . It was inspiring . It was humbling . It was hot . Even his dirty mouth . For a moment , I wondered just how dirty it got , and felt my face get warm . When he came back from the kitchen and sat next to me again , I moved my leg to give him more room . “
22259	22263	22264	22264	I	0	” I whispered . “
22272	22273	22274	22274	You	0	” “
22278	22871	22274	22274	You	0	” Then , to my complete shock , he put his hand on my leg and nudged it back where it had been , resting against his . And left it there . It was on top of the blanket , and it ’s not like he was intimately caressing my inner thigh or anything , but still . Still . My heart thundered . My breath caught . My skin hummed . That ’s when I felt his thumb slowly start to move back and forth just above my knee . Mack What the fuck are you doing ? my inner dad voice barked at me . Stop touching her ! But I left my hand right where it was , enjoying the feel of Frannie ’s knee pressed against my thigh , imagining what it would be like if my hand were beneath the blanket . I knew it was wrong . I knew I ’d probably go to hell for having impure thoughts about the babysitter . I knew I ’d definitely get fired if Sawyer saw me groping his daughter , but I left it . After all , I was n’t really groping her , was I ? It was more of a graze . Innocent . Over the blanket . Out in the open . She probably had n’t even noticed . She was n’t even looking at me . And it felt so nice to sit close to her this way . To touch her . To have her in the room on a winter evening — another adult , someone I could talk to , someone who understood . Maybe she could n’t fully comprehend what it was like to be a single parent , but it was n’t as if she had n’t struggled . She knew what it was like to fear you were falling short , to worry you were fucking up the one chance at life you ’d been given . Like I had when I was deployed , she ’d been forced to consider her own mortality — and she ’d been only a child . My gut churned , imagining what that must have been like for her and for her parents . Frannie appreciated life . She appreciated little things like good meals and kindness and sleigh rides in winter . She was sweet and beautiful and generous — more than worthy of the life she ’d been given . I wished I could tell her that . I wished she was n’t my boss ’s daughter . I wished my kids were n’t in the room . I wished I could share not only this blanket and this couch and this snowy evening with her , but more . A hell of a lot more . But this was as close to her as I could get . * * * By the time the movie was over , Winnie had fallen asleep . I carried her upstairs , managed to get her clothes off , her pajamas on , and wake her up enough to use the bathroom and brush her teeth . A few minutes later , Millie and Felicity came up the stairs to put their pajamas on , arguing about whose room Frannie was going to sleep in . Once I ’d tucked Winnie into bed and kissed her goodnight , I went into the bathroom where they continued to bicker while they brushed their teeth , toothpaste and spit flying everywhere . “
22877	22881	22274	22274	You	0	” said Millie . “
22895	22896	22884	22884	she	0	” “
22906	22910	22884	22884	she	0	” argued Felicity . “
22916	22917	22884	22884	she	0	” “
22934	22939	22884	22884	she	0	” I told her . “
22951	22993	22940	22940	Millie	37	” Actually , what made the most sense in terms of space was to offer her the other side of my king - size bed . And if she wandered over to my side , I would n’t complain one bit . “
22996	23026	22940	22940	Millie	37	” Frannie whispered from the hallway behind me . I turned around and felt my face get hot , as if she might have guessed what I was thinking . “
23029	23034	23035	23035	I	0	” I said quietly . “
23063	23088	23054	23054	she	37	” She was so petite , I figured Millie ’s clothes might fit , although she had a lot more curves . Frannie smiled . “
23102	23103	23091	23091	I	0	” “
23118	23145	23113	23113	she	37	” Behind me , Millie ’s tone was pure eye roll . I frowned over my shoulder at my firstborn , then turned back to Frannie . “
23160	23164	23113	23113	she	37	” She nodded . “

23197	23198	23193	23193	you	91	” “
23201	23211	23193	23193	you	91	” she assured me . I scratched my head . “
23226	23227	23219	23219	I	0	” “
23243	23244	23245	23245	We	557	” “
23261	23262	23248	23248	Millie	37	” “
23267	23268	23265	23265	Dad	216	” “
23277	23305	23265	23265	Dad	216	” I asked Frannie , although I panicked a little at the thought of her taking a shower at my house . She thought for a second . “
23318	23319	23312	23312	I	0	” “
23326	23348	23351	23351	Felicity	38	” said Felicity , bolting out of the bathroom and going to the linen closet at the top of the stairs . “
23359	23364	23365	23365	Girls	1391	” I told Frannie . “
23385	23553	23374	23374	I	0	” Downstairs , I went into my room and searched for a clean T - shirt for her to sleep in . Unfortunately , my nicest white ones were either dirty or freshly laundered but pink . Cursing , I hunted through my drawers and found a dark gray one with USMC written across the chest in thick black letters . It was faded , but had minimal fraying and no pit stains . She would swim in it , but at least it would be more comfortable than sleeping in her clothes . Oh , fuck . Do n’t think about her without clothes on . I grabbed an extra pillow from my bed , tossed it onto the couch on my way through the living room , and hurried back upstairs , where the bathroom door was closed . With the T - shirt in my hand , I said goodnight to Millie and Felicity , kissing their foreheads and telling them I loved them . “
23566	23572	23563	23563	Frannie	248	” asked Millie , yawning . “
23582	23612	23563	23563	Frannie	248	” Grimacing , I remembered how my engine refused to turn over earlier . Assuming it was a dead battery , I ’d have to get a jump tomorrow . “
23618	23703	23563	23563	Frannie	248	” When I left her room , Frannie was coming out of the bathroom , and we met in the hall . She ’d left the light on , thank goodness , otherwise we ’d have been alone in the dark . Her face was freshly washed , and she looked even younger and sweeter without any makeup on . Because she is young and sweet . So stop thinking about putting your dick in her mouth . I thrust the shirt at her . “
23706	23713	23563	23563	Frannie	248	” She took it from me . “
23718	23719	23563	23563	Frannie	248	” “
23751	23752	23744	23744	I	0	” “
23755	23756	23744	23744	I	0	” “
23766	23767	23744	23744	I	0	” “
23772	23926	23744	23744	I	0	” She smiled at me , and my chest got so tight I could hardly breathe . Go , asshole . Get the pillowcase . Get downstairs . Leave her alone to change and get the hell into your room where you belong . Then shut the door and do n’t even think about coming out again . But I stood there staring at her for ten more seconds , my hands clenched in fists at my sides . I wanted to kiss her so fucking badly . Just once , to know what those sweet little lips would feel like on mine . To hold her in my arms . I found myself wondering , on a scale of one to ten , exactly how wrong it would be . A seven ? An eight ? I shoved my hands in my pockets . She glanced over her shoulder into the bathroom . “
23933	23937	23928	23928	I	0	” I nodded . “
23943	23944	23928	23928	I	0	” “
23948	24132	23928	23928	I	0	” She went into the bathroom and shut the door , and I slumped over with a sigh of relief . Fuck . That was close . Then I ran to the linen closet , grabbed a spare pillowcase , and descended the stairs three at a time . I had to be out of the living room by the time she came down . The problem was , I ’m shit at changing pillowcases . I can get the old one off just fine , but fuck if I can get the new one on . Three minutes in , I was flustered and sweaty and still trying to shove that fat fucking pillow into the case — why the hell was this so difficult ? Why was it sideways ? Had the case shrunk in the dryer ? Cursing , I switched on a lamp and tried again . Of course , she came tiptoeing down the stairs in time to see me struggling with it . Giggling , she set her clothing on the couch and reached for the pillow . “
24143	24144	23928	23928	I	0	” “
24147	24200	23928	23928	I	0	” Gladly , I handed it over , groaning inwardly at the sight of her in my shirt . It was huge on her — the hem nearly reached her knees — but that was probably a good thing . I did not need to see any more of her bare legs . “
24203	24220	23928	23928	I	0	” She slipped the pillowcase on with no trouble at all . I shook my head . “
24236	24248	24249	24249	I	0	” She hugged the pillow and gave me a devious smile . “
24254	24396	24249	24249	I	0	” God , she was cute . And sexy . And really , really close . The curtains were closed and only one lamp was on , making the room feel intimate . The house was sleepy and silent under the snow , and we were alone — whatever happened would be our secret . My mind went to a dangerous place . My heart was doing something scary in my chest . Nothing can happen , I told myself . Nothing . But instead of backing away from her and going to bed like I was supposed to , I reached for the pillow she held and tossed it onto the couch . Her smile faded . I moved closer to her . I took her face in my hands . I rubbed a thumb over her soft pink lips . “
24406	24411	24397	24397	You	564	” I said quietly . “
24414	24418	24397	24397	You	564	” she whispered . “
24432	24445	24446	24446	Mack	1505	” Her hands slid up my chest as she rose on tiptoe . “
24451	24736	24737	24737	Frannie	248	” I lowered my mouth to hers , vowing that I ’d only kiss her once — one time — just to know what it was like . Of course , that was before she opened her lips and invited my tongue between them . It was before she slipped her arms around my neck and pressed her chest to mine . It was before my hands moved down her sides and crept beneath the bottom of my shirt . And it was well before she jumped up and wrapped her legs around me , entreating my hands to slip beneath that ass I ’d been thinking about all day . Because after that , I was fucked . My dick was hard as a rock . My adrenaline was pumping . My willpower had disintegrated . I stumbled backward onto the couch and set her on my lap so she straddled my thighs . My hands stole underneath her shirt and hers slid into my hair . She sighed softly , pleadingly , as I covered her breasts with my palms and stroked her nipples with my thumbs . Her head fell to one side , and I moved my mouth down her throat , tasting her skin . My cock twitched , trapped between us . She took my head in her hands and brought my lips back to hers , rocking her hips , rubbing herself against me . Oh , God . This was getting precarious . Another minute of her grinding on me like that and I was going to embarrass us both by going off like a rocket , and I really did n’t want to do that . “
24739	24753	24754	24754	We	565	” I put my hands on her shoulders and gently pushed her back . “
24759	24760	24754	24754	We	565	” “
24766	24771	24754	24754	We	565	” she asked breathlessly . “
24777	24808	24754	24754	We	565	” Actually , I ’d forgotten all about the kids , which was yet another sign that this was not a good idea . It was killing my brain cells . “
24853	24854	24855	24855	I	0	” “
24860	24861	24855	24855	I	0	” “
24866	24872	24855	24855	I	0	” She laughed a little . “
24892	24908	24889	24889	We	565	” She hesitated , and when she spoke again her voice was softer , shyer . “
24916	24920	24889	24889	We	565	” I groaned . “
24927	24928	24923	24923	We	565	” “
24943	24944	24934	24934	I	0	” “
24953	24954	24934	24934	I	0	” “
24963	24974	24934	24934	I	0	” I shook my head , vowing to stay strong . “
24977	24978	24934	24934	I	0	” “
24981	24982	24934	24934	I	0	” “
24985	25016	24934	24934	I	0	” Summoning up every ounce of willpower I had , and some I did n’t , I lifted her up , set her down beside me , and stood up . “
25020	25027	24934	24934	I	0	” She looked up at me . “
25034	25035	25036	25036	Christ	74	” “
25043	25087	25040	25040	I	0	” In fact , my hard - on was refusing to give up , and I had to adjust myself in my pants . Her expression was amused as she watched me , her eyes taking in the obvious bulge at my crotch . “
25095	25096	25040	25040	I	0	” “
25104	25151	25152	25152	I	0	” It was a struggle to keep my voice down . I was angry and wanted to yell — not at her , exactly , but just in general . At the situation . And definitely at myself . I ran a hand through my hair . “
25170	25179	25167	25167	my	0	” She sighed resignedly and shook her head . “
25186	25187	25167	25167	my	0	” “
25191	25207	25208	25208	I	0	” I could barely look her in the eye , but I forced myself to . “
25232	25241	25244	25244	Mack	1505	” She surprised me by rolling her eyes . “
25289	25290	25291	25291	You	248	” “
25296	25311	25291	25291	You	248	” She nodded and looked down at her knees , which were pressed together . “
25314	25325	25326	25326	You	248	” I tried to take the edge off my voice . “
25351	25352	25344	25344	we	572	” “
25362	25363	25356	25356	I	0	” “
25371	25377	25365	25365	I	0	” She lifted her chin . “
25387	25400	25365	25365	I	0	” I struggled with how else to communicate what I was thinking . “
25409	25410	25365	25365	I	0	” “
25414	25419	25365	25365	I	0	” she said tightly . “
25466	25511	25459	25459	I	0	” With that she angrily grabbed the pillow , stuck it at one end of the couch and lay back , throwing the blanket over her legs . I was simultaneously sad to see them disappear and glad they were n’t visible any longer . “
25514	25587	25459	25459	I	0	” she said , pulling the blanket up to her chin and closing her eyes . Accepting the fact that there was no way to exit this situation gracefully — especially not with a massive , stubborn erection — I switched off the lamp and left the room . Inside my bedroom , I shut the door and sat down on the foot of the bed , hands propped on my knees . “
25590	26455	26456	26456	Mack	1505	” I whispered , squeezing my eyes shut . Why was my gut churning ? Had n’t I done the right thing ? Had n’t I put my own urges aside ? Had n’t I done exactly what I ’d have wanted another man to do if Frannie were one of my daughters , years from now ? I flopped back on my bed and threw an arm over my eyes . Christ . I did n’t want to think about my daughters in the future . I did n’t want to think about them now . And I did n’t want to treat Frannie like she was one of them — because that ’s not how I saw her at all . But it was wrong to want her this way . I could n’t get past it . Eventually , I dragged myself off the bed and into the bathroom to brush my teeth . Then I undressed down to my underwear , pulled on some sweatpants , turned off the light , and crawled beneath the covers alone , which I would probably do for the rest of my fucking life . Except … I could n’t stop thinking about her . Those bare legs beneath the hem of my shirt . The taste of her kiss . The scent of her hair . The hard little tips of her breasts beneath my palms . The way she straddled my body and moved above me . My dick was so hard , and it would feel so good to be inside her . My body was desperate for the release . And she ’d wanted it too , had n’t she ? Maybe she was just as lonely as I was . Maybe she was only looking for a little companionship . A little fun . A connection . I found myself wavering . What would be the harm ? We were two consenting adults , were n’t we ? Maybe once would be okay . Maybe we could have this one moment of insanity , and then go back to normal . Maybe all I needed was to get this out of my system . And I was so sick and tired of feeling like my entire purpose in life was to be a Responsible Person . I used to be unpredictable . I used to be bold . I used to take risks and act on instinct and say fuck the consequences . My feet touched the floor , and before I knew it , I was opening my bedroom door and moving through the dark . Frannie I stared at the ceiling in the dark , alternately angry and humiliated . He ’d wanted me , had n’t he ? Of course he had — I’d felt it between his legs . And he ’d kissed me first ! He ’d put his hands all over my skin ! My breasts ached as I recalled his touch , and the unrequited longing in my body refused to ease up . I was restless and irritated , with him and with myself . Although it was kind of nice that he was trying to be noble and heroic about the whole sex thing . I understood his point — he worked for my dad , so technically , yes , I was the boss ’s daughter . And his part - time nanny . And ten years younger . But dammit , I ’d been harboring this crush on him forever . I did n’t care about those other things . I wanted to be with him . And now he knew it . Ugh . I squeezed my eyes shut , feeling like a kid who ’d made a total ass out of herself in front of her teacher crush . Had I really suggested he take me back to his bedroom ? Shaking my head back and forth , I tried to erase the memory of his rejection . So much for seduction . But the longer I lay there , awake and shivering a little beneath the blanket , the more I realized I was n’t sorry for trying . At least I ’d taken a risk . Acted on an impulse . Granted , it had n’t gone as well as I ’d hoped , but still — Mack had kissed me . I turned onto my side , pulling the blanket up over my shoulder and closing my eyes . I was n’t sure how long I ’d been lying there when I felt a hand on my hip . I opened my eyes and saw Mack crouched next to me , balanced on the balls of his feet . Shirtless . My breath caught . He put a finger to his lips . My heart started to pound . Was this real or a dream ? Without wanting to know for sure , I put my hand in his and rose from the couch . He led me through the dining room and into his bedroom , closing the door soundlessly behind me . “
26463	26493	26494	26494	I	0	” I whispered . Instead of answering , he pushed me back against the door and kissed me hard and deep , his arms caging me on either side . “
26499	26500	26494	26494	I	0	” “
26503	26504	26494	26494	I	0	” “
26527	26540	26542	26542	you	1505	” His voice was quiet but gravelly , more growl than whisper . “
26545	26546	26542	26542	you	1505	” “
26575	26588	26571	26571	I	0	” I put my hands on his chest and pushed him back . “
26593	26684	26589	26589	I	0	” Then I grabbed the bottom of the shirt I wore and whipped it over my head . Immediately our bodies came together , our bare chests pressed tight , our mouths sealed . Somehow , we managed to make it over to the bed , where he worked his pants off and stretched out above me . My heart was pumping so furiously , I was nearly afraid the doctors were wrong and there was something it could n’t handle — getting naked with Declan MacAllister . I shivered . “
26689	26693	26589	26589	I	0	” he asked . “
26698	26739	26740	26740	We	576	” He smiled down at me in the dark . The warmth and weight of his masculine , muscular body was like heaven , and I wrapped my arms and legs around him . His erection pressed hard against me . “
26746	26756	26740	26740	We	576	” he whispered , his breath on my lips . “
26762	26766	26757	26757	I	0	” I promised . “
26769	27036	27038	27038	I	0	” He kissed me then , sending stars shooting throughout my body , to the ends of every finger and toe . I kissed him back like I ’d never kissed anyone before , like he was the air I needed to breathe . I loved the warmth of his skin on mine , the way he smelled , the thickness of his chest . Mack , Mack , Mack . He put his hands on my breasts , making me arch into his touch and bite my lip to keep from sighing too loudly . He moved his mouth down my throat and chest , stroked my tingling nipples with his tongue , teased them into unbearably hard peaks that he sucked and flicked and caught between his teeth . I wove my hands into his hair , writhing rapturously beneath him . When he kissed a path down my belly , I began to panic that I would n’t be able to keep my promise about being quiet . He barely lifted his mouth from me as he dragged my underwear from my legs . Then his head totally disappeared beneath the blanket , and he pushed my thighs apart . At the first sweep of his tongue , I yelped . I could n’t help it . Immediately , I slapped a hand over my mouth . I heard him laugh before he gave me another long and luscious stroke across my clit . I yelped again and clapped the other hand over the first . Mack pushed the blanket off his head . “
27041	27049	27038	27038	I	0	” I shook my head . Vehemently . “
27061	27180	27057	27057	angel	577	” He returned to what he ’d been doing , and I whimpered helplessly behind my palms . He slid a finger inside me , and I covered my face with a pillow . He sucked my clit into his mouth while he fucked me with one finger , then two , causing my body to hum and tighten and fill with uncontrollable longing , until finally it was too much for me to contain and everything burst wide open in an explosion of stars that rained down around me . I might have been quiet . I was n’t really sure . With one last kiss on my inner thigh , Mack moved up my body again . “
27184	27192	27194	27194	I	0	” he said , his voice raw . “
27198	27202	27203	27203	I	0	” I whispered . “
27222	27228	27208	27208	I	0	” He kissed my neck . “
27235	27241	27208	27208	I	0	” He kissed my jaw . “
27256	27296	27208	27208	I	0	” He covered my mouth with his , and I twined my limbs around him , desperate for the very same thing . I could feel how big and hard he was as he rocked his hips above me . “
27299	27306	27208	27208	I	0	” I said against his lips . “
27315	27504	27506	27506	you	579	” Mack leaned over me to open the nightstand drawer . Ten seconds later , he ’d shoved his underwear off his legs and was kneeling between my legs , rolling a condom on . I ’d seen other guys do this twice before , but it was always awkward and fumbling , like they had n’t wanted me to even look at them . Granted , those had been skinny adolescent boys compared to the man in front of me now . He was mature and confident , rugged and strong . Everything about him exuded masculinity , from the stubble on his chin to the hair on his chest , to his muscular arms and thick , hard cock . But I barely had time to admire his silhouette in the shadowy dark before he was above me again , positioning himself between my legs , then easing inside me . Slowly . Inch by hot , rock - solid inch . I took a few deep breaths and closed my eyes as my body got used to being stretched so tight and filled so completely . “
27509	27513	27514	27514	You	579	” he asked . “
27522	27565	27514	27514	You	579	” But he was already starting to move , his hips undulating over mine in deep , unhurried strokes . Echoing his rhythm , I moved my hips beneath his , sliding my hands down his back and whispering in his ear . “
27578	27594	27572	27572	I	0	” He kept the rhythm slow and steady , his voice low in my ear . “
27613	27614	27572	27572	I	0	” “
27618	27623	27572	27572	I	0	” I struggled to speak “
27628	27645	27572	27572	I	0	” He changed the angle , making me gasp and sink my teeth into his shoulder . “
27676	27826	27827	27827	Mack	1505	” God , I loved his foul mouth . I ’d donate every cent I had to the swear jaw if he ’d just keep talking to me that way . And the way he moved , oh my God … Already aroused from my first orgasm , my body was more than responsive to a second one . Within a few minutes , I felt myself at the edge of the cliff once more , and every deep , hard thrust of his cock pushed me closer to jumping off . And if Mack ’s strangled moans and ragged breaths were any indication , he was just as close . I clawed at his skin . I choked back cries . I grabbed his ass and pulled him into me , wanting more , more , more , even though I knew my body could n’t take it . “
27829	27833	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” I begged . “
27836	28012	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” Just saying his name , feeling it on my lips as he moved inside me , was a kind of ecstasy . Sex with Mack was unlike anything I ’d ever experienced before . Rougher . Deeper . More intense . It felt like the real thing , like the times before were silly imitations . And every sensation was heightened by the fact that we could n’t be loud . It was damn near impossible ! All my effort was needed to keep from crying out — in pleasure , in pain , in total disbelief that this was actually happening . Then he was cursing into the pillow beneath my head and his muscles clenched and I felt his orgasm rippling through his body into mine . It sent me spiraling over the heights , head over heels , spinning and falling and pulsing and holding him close as we shared this insanely powerful , extraordinary thing . A few moments later , he lifted his chest off mine and pulled out . “
28019	28020	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” “
28023	28162	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” I said , disappointed he wanted to get up so fast . While he was in the bathroom , I lay there clutching the blankets beneath my chin . I could n’t believe this ! Just to be sure it was n’t a dream , I pinched myself . Hard . Nope . It ’s real . But now what ? I could n’t actually sleep in here , could I ? No , I should go back out to the couch . We did not need his kids discovering me in his bedroom in the morning . I found my underwear at the bottom of the bed , yanked them on , and was hunting around on the floor for my T - shirt when Mack opened the bathroom door . Light spilled into the bedroom . “
28165	28169	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” he said . “
28172	28190	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” Spying the shirt on the floor , I straightened up and slipped it over my head . “
28201	28202	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” “
28207	28424	27834	27834	Mack	1505	” He stepped aside as I passed him , giving me way more space than I needed to get by , which seemed kind of weird since his sweaty , naked body had been tangled up with mine for the last thirty minutes . That was a move you made passing someone in the hallway at work , not in the bedroom after sex . Were we going backward now ? In the bathroom , I shut the door behind me and cleaned up a little , trying not to read too much into it . But something felt off . I dried my hands and paused for a moment before reaching for the doorknob . After a couple deep breaths , I turned off the light and opened the door , hoping I ’d been wrong . My eyes were n’t used to the dark , and I was n’t sure where he was at first . It took me a moment to realize he was n’t even in the room . I stood there for a minute , confused and blinking at the empty bed , when the bedroom door opened . Mack entered , holding the pillow I ’d been using on the couch . He wore sweatpants and a T - shirt . “
28427	28431	28432	28432	I	0	” he whispered . “

28507	28528	28529	28529	Mack	1505	” It actually had n’t been that cold out there , but suddenly it felt damn near Arctic in here . “
28533	28534	28529	28529	Mack	1505	” “
28544	28545	28529	28529	Mack	1505	” “

28578	28592	28571	28571	You	0	” He grabbed the door handle and began pulling it shut behind him . “
28595	28596	28601	28601	Mack	1505	” “
28603	28610	28601	28601	Mack	1505	” I walked toward the doorway . “
28618	28638	28601	28601	Mack	1505	” He hesitated , but then did as I asked and entered his bedroom again , closing the door . “
28641	28642	28601	28601	Mack	1505	” “
28645	28654	28601	28601	Mack	1505	” I folded my arms over my chest . “
28658	28659	28601	28601	Mack	1505	” “
28665	28666	28667	28667	I	0	” “
28681	28682	28683	28683	I	0	” “
28693	28717	28718	28718	I	0	” Of course not . I wanted to ride off into the sunset with him . Cue the music . Roll the credits . “
28729	28730	28725	28725	I	0	” “
28741	28762	28739	28739	Frannie	248	” He ’d adopted a sort of I ’m Older And Wiser tone that made me feel five years old . “
28778	28826	28739	28739	Frannie	248	” Nice break from the norm ? Nice ? I ’d just experienced the most unbelievable , mind - blowing , earth - shattering sex imaginable . My life would never be the same . And he ’d thought it was nice ? I wanted to die . “
28829	28848	28739	28739	Frannie	248	” I said , glad the lights were off so he could n’t see how mortified I was . “
28856	28857	28739	28739	Frannie	248	” “
28863	28868	28860	28860	We	586	” He sounded relieved . “
28894	29431	29432	29432	She	587	” He was out the door before I could even say it back . Confused , hurt , and embarrassed , I crawled back into the bed , which smelled like him . Curling up on my side with a pillow in my arms , I fought off the lump swelling in my throat . Then I was angry . Grow up , Frannie . You wanted to be treated like an adult ? Free to make your own mistakes ? Here you are — a great big plate of THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE , served cold with a side of humiliation . And it wo n’t do you any good to cry over it . What , did you think he was going to confess his undying love just because he gave you a couple orgasms in the middle of the night ? Did you think you two would be a couple now ? What a joke . Sometimes sex is just sex , and you ’re acting like a teenager , sniveling into a pillow in the dark . No wonder he thinks you ’re too young for him . You knew your feelings for him were pointless from the start , so do n’t pretend otherwise . Only a child believes in fairy tales . Mack I hurried out to the couch and stretched out , tossing the blanket over my legs . Jesus , that had felt good . Even better than I ’d imagined — and I ’d imagined it a lot . Everything about it had been really intense — the heat , the chemistry , the connection . I had n’t felt that in years , if ever . Maybe it was the whole forbidden aspect , maybe it was the fact that I ’d been fantasizing about her illicitly for months , or maybe my dick was really that starved for attention after a year of celibacy , but honest to God , I could have wept after that orgasm . For a moment , I let myself imagine what it would be like if I were younger and did n’t have kids . If I were free to pursue her . Win her . Keep her . Christ , I ’d fucking spoil her rotten all the time . She was that perfect combination of sexy and sweet — it drove me crazy in the best possible way . In another life , I ’d have done everything possible to make her mine . But as it stood , I ’d meant what I said . As good as the sex had been , we could n’t do it again . She was still too young , she was still the boss ’s daughter , she was still the nanny , and I was in no position to pursue anyone . Thank God she agreed with me that we should just pretend it never happened and go back to the way things were . I really did n’t know what I ’d do without her . * * * In the morning , the girls came down in their pajamas and asked where Frannie was . “
29438	29452	29432	29432	She	587	” I told them , yawning and pulling the blanket over my shoulder . “
29475	29483	29487	29487	her	587	” None of them batted an eye . “
29491	29495	29487	29487	her	587	” Felicity asked . “
29504	29505	29487	29487	her	587	” “
29511	29525	29487	29487	her	587	” Reluctantly , I sat up . Scratched my stomach . Winifred giggled . “
29533	29534	29528	29528	Daddy	36	” “
29537	29543	29528	29528	Daddy	36	” the older two chorused . “
29546	29559	29528	29528	Daddy	36	” I said , grabbing Winnie and throwing her across my lap . “
29568	29569	29528	29528	Daddy	36	” “
29575	29579	29572	29572	you	0	” squealed Felicity . “
29586	29587	29572	29572	you	0	” “
29613	29747	29608	29608	I	0	” But for a second , I wondered what Frannie had thought of my body . I was n’t in my twenties anymore , and while I was physically fit , I did n’t have one of those carefully groomed , perfectly smooth , manscaped male bodies . She had n’t seemed to mind , and I ’d been too turned on to give a fuck about it last night , but now I hoped she had n’t been disappointed … I found myself saying a quick prayer . Please , God , let it have been even half as good for her as it was for me . Shoving last night out of my head , I rose to my feet and threw Winnie over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes . “
29761	29815	29608	29608	I	0	” They whined and protested , but they followed me into the kitchen and watched as I began opening the fridge , the freezer , and multiple cupboards . Of course , they rejected everything I offered them — waffles , oatmeal , pancakes , eggs , toast , cereal , granola bars . “
29850	29851	29853	29853	we	592	” “
29858	29862	29853	29853	we	592	” Felicity insisted . “
29875	29912	29865	29865	I	0	” That ’s when I heard my bedroom door open , and then footsteps on the dining room ’s creaky oak floor . Frannie tiptoed into view , hair mussed , arms crossed over her chest . “
29915	29955	29865	29865	I	0	” she said . I was n’t prepared for the sight of her . My heart skidded . My throat went dry . My dick twitched in my pants . I moved behind the island and cleared my throat . “
29958	29959	29960	29960	Daddy	36	” “
29972	29982	29960	29960	Daddy	36	” Millie complained . I felt like pinching her . “
29988	29994	29984	29984	you	595	” Frannie smiled at her . “
30007	30008	30009	30009	Yay	88	” “
30013	30068	30009	30009	Yay	88	” Without another look at me , Frannie went into the living room to retrieve her clothes . Then she must have gone upstairs to the bathroom to change , because she did n’t come back to the kitchen until she was fully dressed . Our eyes met only briefly before she looked away . “
30071	30080	30085	30085	girls	158	” she said , pushing up her sleeves . “
30132	30133	30085	30085	girls	158	” “
30136	30143	30085	30085	girls	158	” Millie rubbed her hands together . “
30148	30149	30145	30145	I	0	” “
30152	30168	30169	30169	Millie	37	” Frannie set to work , giving the girls small , age - appropriate tasks . “
30211	30299	30320	30320	Sugar	96	” I put on a pot of coffee and stayed out of their way , checking messages on my phone , texting Sawyer that I ’d be late , glancing out the front window to see if the street had been plowed yet ( it had ) , and the back to see how much snow the blower would have to handle ( a lot ) . When the coffee was ready , I poured a cup and asked Frannie if she ’d like one , too . “
30304	30317	30320	30320	Sugar	96	” she said without taking her eyes off what she was doing . “
30322	30349	30320	30320	Sugar	96	” I asked , wishing she ’d look at me like she had last night , with adoration in her eyes . Or at least warmth . “
30353	30537	30538	30538	Daddy	36	” I poured her a cup and left it on the island while I sipped mine standing on the dining room side of the breakfast bar . The girls were happily following her directions , not arguing , and working harder than they ever worked in the kitchen for me . They were even rinsing the dishes as they went along , and putting them in the dishwasher . A few times , I tried to catch Frannie ’s eye and smile , but she never seemed to look in my direction . After a while , I gave up and went into my room to get dressed . I tried not to look at the bed and think of her bare limbs between my sheets , but it was impossible . Not only did I look , but I went over and grabbed a pillow , lifting it to my face and inhaling deeply . Her scent lingered on the cotton , sweet and sexy at the same time , just like she was . My stomach muscles tightened , and I — “
30540	30575	30538	30538	Daddy	36	” I glanced at the door , which apparently I had n’t shut all the way . Felicity had pushed it open and stood there blinking at me with owlish eyes behind her glasses . “
30581	30582	30538	30538	Daddy	36	” “
30585	30595	30596	30596	I	0	” I tossed the pillow onto the tangled sheets . “
30609	30610	30611	30611	We	599	” “
30624	30625	30620	30620	we	599	” “
30629	30633	30634	30634	I	0	” I frowned . “
30666	30667	30668	30668	We	599	” “
30675	30676	30668	30668	We	599	” “
30685	30729	30681	30681	I	0	” I followed her back to the kitchen , where Frannie was doing her best to reach the handle above the fridge without much luck . I puffed my chest out a bit , feeling like a Man Coming to Save the Day . “
30735	30780	30733	30733	me	0	” Coming up behind her — way closer than necessary — I reached over her head and pulled the cupboard open . She immediately ducked out of my way . I stared into the cupboard without seeing anything for a moment , then refocused . “
30787	30815	30733	30733	me	0	” I grabbed a small brown plastic bottle and handed it to Frannie . She inspected the label , then twisted off the cap and sniffed it . “
30833	31104	30831	30831	girls	1391	” She turned away from me and resumed baking with the kids . I realized she had n’t looked at me once . Fine . Be that way . Irrationally angry , I stomped off to my room , got dressed , then stomped into the back hall to put on all my winter crap — boots , coat , scarf , hat , gloves — without looking at anyone . When I was ready , I risked a glance at her and caught her looking at me . Immediately she turned in the opposite direction . I went out the back door and closed it with a bang . * * * After snow blowing my driveway and Mrs. Gardner ’s next door , I shoveled both front walkways and porch steps , then moved on to the back . When I was done there , I grabbed a shovel and went out to the curb to dig out Frannie ’s car , although what I really felt like doing was marching into the house and demanding to know why she was giving me the cold shoulder . Because the more I thought about it , the more I decided this was not what we had agreed on . We said we were going to pretend it never happened and go back to the way things were before . This was n’t how things had been before ! Full of furious energy , I finished the job and stomped back into the house . The kitchen was blissfully warm and smelled heavenly . But I was grumpy as fuck . “
31111	31165	30831	30831	girls	1391	” I asked Frannie , who was loading the dishwasher . Without answering , she went over to her purse and took them out . Then she handed them to me without meeting my eyes or saying a thing . I glanced toward the living room , but did n’t see the kids . “
31171	31172	30831	30831	girls	1391	” “
31176	31194	30831	30831	girls	1391	” She put a detergent pod in the dishwasher , closed the door , and started it . “
31201	31218	30831	30831	girls	1391	” I blurted , unable to stand it anymore . She began wiping down the counter . “
31226	31232	31221	31221	I	0	” I rolled my eyes . “
31236	31237	31221	31221	I	0	” “
31246	31331	31332	31332	Daddy	36	” I stared at her back for a moment , then stormed out the back door , slamming it behind me . Hard . Her car started fine , so after I ’d taken a quick shower and gotten dressed , we all piled into it for the drive to Cloverleigh . I was behind the wheel , Frannie was in the passenger seat , and the girls were squeezed in the back . The tension in the front seat was icy and thick . “
31343	31347	31332	31332	Daddy	36	” Felicity asked . “
31354	31355	31332	31332	Daddy	36	” “
31361	31366	31332	31332	Daddy	36	” I said tersely . “
31374	31378	31379	31379	I	0	” Winnie asked . “
31385	31386	31379	31379	I	0	” “
31393	31394	31388	31388	Frannie	248	” “
31405	31406	31401	31401	Frannie	248	” “
31411	31416	31401	31401	Frannie	248	” Frannie said stiffly . “
31423	31427	31428	31428	I	0	” Millie wondered . “
31434	31435	31428	31428	I	0	” “
31441	31445	31428	31428	I	0	” I snapped . “
31453	31454	31455	31455	Jeez	204	” “
31466	31470	31455	31455	Jeez	204	” Millie asked . “
31479	31521	31455	31455	Jeez	204	” I roared . From my right I could feel Frannie ’s eyes on me . I clenched my jaw and gripped the wheel tighter . When we arrived at Cloverleigh , Daphne Sawyer came rushing out from behind the desk . “
31542	31543	31582	31582	girls	227	” “
31550	31568	31582	31582	girls	227	” I said . But I could n’t seem to unclench my jaw . She hugged Frannie . “
31584	31593	31582	31582	girls	227	” she added , smiling at my daughters . “
31606	31607	31594	31595	Mr. Sawyer	97	” “
31617	31888	31594	31595	Mr. Sawyer	97	” asked Frannie . The girls jumped up and down with excitement at both ideas . After thanking Daphne and Frannie , and warning the kids to behave , I went back to my office and tried to get things done , but it was tough going . My dark mood refused to lift . I barked at DeSantis when he checked with me about his new bottling line . I skipped lunch to punish myself and my stomach growled hungrily all afternoon . I swore at the guy from the towing company when he told me they were backed up because of the snow and he was n’t sure when they ’d be able to get to my car . And all day long I kept glancing out the window , wondering if the kids were out in the sleigh with Frannie and whether she hated my guts for last night . Sure seemed like it this morning . But I knew I had n’t forced her to do anything she did n’t want to do . Had she faked her orgasms ? Maybe I was n’t the stud I thought I was . The thought did not sit well with me . Or had I hurt her feelings somehow ? Slighted her in some way ? Had I said something insensitive without realizing it ? Goddamn , I was fucking clueless about women . Around four - thirty , my ex called . Of course . I winced when I saw her name on my phone and gave the screen the finger , but I took the call . “
31891	31892	31594	31595	Mr. Sawyer	97	” “
31897	31901	31902	31902	I	0	” she said . “
31905	31917	31902	31902	I	0	” I pinched the bridge of my nose with two fingers . “
31923	31924	31925	31925	I	0	” “
31935	31941	31933	31933	you	0	” Her voice oozed sarcasm . “
31944	31949	31950	31950	I	0	” A heavy sigh . “
31957	31958	31950	31950	I	0	” “
31965	31966	31960	31960	you	0	” “

32012	32016	32005	32005	you	0	” I said . “
32030	32031	32032	32032	I	0	” “
32036	32040	32032	32032	I	0	” she snapped . “

32088	32089	32079	32079	I	0	” “
32095	32099	32090	32090	They	227	” she snapped . “
32106	32107	32100	32100	I	0	” “
32110	32197	32198	32198	Daddy	36	” I ended the call and tossed my phone onto my desk . I felt like throwing it out the window . Why the hell did she bother coming at all ? She did n’t really care about them . And she ’d probably spend the entire weekend badmouthing me . Suddenly my office door swung open , and the girls came running in . They were red - cheeked and runny - nosed from the cold , and their hair was matted from their hats . “
32200	32205	32206	32206	I	0	” Winnie said excitedly . “
32213	32214	32215	32215	Me	0	” “
32218	32233	32215	32215	Me	0	” said Felicity , taking off her glasses to wipe the fog off them . “
32243	32244	32245	32245	Frannie	248	” “
32263	32267	32245	32245	Frannie	248	” Millie bubbled . “
32272	32300	32270	32270	we	612	” I checked my watch . It was going on five and getting close to dinner time , but I still had some things to finish up . “
32334	32335	32322	32322	I	0	” “
32342	32396	32397	32397	I	0	” Frannie asked from the doorway . She ’d changed clothes , and her long hair was in two gold - streaked braids over her shoulders . They made her look even younger than she was , and my heart sank even lower . She had no idea what she did to me . “
32400	32404	32405	32405	I	0	” I admitted . “
32430	32431	32422	32422	I	0	” “
32438	32459	32422	32422	I	0	” she said , but there was still none of the warmth in her face that had been there yesterday . “
32470	32482	32468	32468	girls	227	” She gathered them up and steered them into the hallway . “
32490	32491	32492	32492	Frannie	248	” “
32496	32507	32492	32492	Frannie	248	” She looked back at me , her expression blank . “
32510	32534	32492	32492	Frannie	248	” But what could I say with the kids right there within earshot ? I ’m sorry , I mouthed . She shrugged . “
32541	32542	32492	32492	Frannie	248	” “
32552	32553	32492	32492	Frannie	248	” “
32560	32609	32554	32554	I	0	” Then she disappeared , pulling the door shut behind her . Cursing , I flopped back into my chair . Two knocks on my door , and then it opened . For a second , I thought maybe it would be Frannie , but it was DeSantis . “
32614	32622	32554	32554	I	0	” I said despondently . He laughed . “
32632	32643	32554	32554	I	0	” I sighed and rubbed my face with my hands . “
32660	32661	32662	32662	I	0	” “
32686	32687	32662	32662	I	0	” “
32697	32703	32662	32662	I	0	” DeSantis shook his head . “
32718	32719	32720	32720	I	0	” “
32727	32735	32720	32720	I	0	” Suddenly I looked up at him . “
32746	32747	32739	32739	I	0	” “
32754	32755	32739	32739	I	0	” “
32774	32778	32739	32739	I	0	” He nodded . “
32784	32785	32739	32739	I	0	” “
32819	32820	32811	32811	we	621	” “
32824	32825	32811	32811	we	621	” “
32838	32839	32840	32840	I	0	” “
32847	33229	32840	32840	I	0	” I picked up my phone and texted Frannie . Thanks for the offer , but no need to drive us back . DeSantis can take us . OK . I glared at my screen and typed another message . I ’ll come get the kids in fifteen minutes . OK . I sat there stewing for a moment , then set my phone aside and tried to answer some emails . But only about three minutes had gone by when I gave up on concentration , slammed my laptop shut , and marched out of my office . What the fuck did she want from me ? I ’d apologized . I ’d asked her if she was mad . If she had something to say , why did n’t she say it ? She was being immature and ridiculous , and I was going to tell her so . Frannie We ’d barely gotten up to my suite when he texted me that I did n’t have to drive him home . Good , I thought . The less I had to see him , the better . All day long , I ’d done my best to pretend nothing had happened , but it was useless . He was all I could think about . And I did n’t know how to act around him now — there was this weird tension between us that had n’t existed before . He did n’t seem too comfortable around me , either . I ’d never seen him as grouchy and mad as he ’d been by the time we ’d left the house . I wanted to ask him what was wrong , but I could n’t . Every moment in his presence was torture for me . All I wanted was to get to the end of this day so I could curl up in a ball on my couch and have a good ugly cry . I ’d thought being with him that way would be a dream come true , but this felt like a nightmare . When the hot chocolate was done , I ladled it into mugs for the girls , then let them squirt it with whipped cream and decorate it with sprinkles . “
33237	33351	33352	33352	They	625	” said Millie , licking whipped cream off her spoon . As soon as I got them situated at the counter , there was a knock at my door . I glanced at my phone , which told me it had been little more than five minutes since he ’d texted he ’d be up to get the kids in fifteen . I went to the door and pulled it open , and there he was in the hallway , looking restless and agitated . His hair was kind of a mess , and his hands were fisted at his sides . Still , my heart went crazy at the sight of him . “
33359	33363	33352	33352	They	625	” I said . “
33374	33393	33369	33369	I	0	” Shrugging , I opened the door so he could come in , but he shook his head . “
33400	33401	33369	33369	I	0	” “
33404	33411	33369	33369	I	0	” I glanced at the kids . “
33414	33446	33369	33369	I	0	” Making sure the door was unlocked , I went out into the hall and pulled it shut behind me . Then I leaned back against it and folded my arms . “
33451	33452	33453	33453	Frannie	248	” “
33455	33462	33453	33453	Frannie	248	” He was in no mood . “
33465	33466	33453	33453	Frannie	248	” “
33470	33471	33453	33453	Frannie	248	” “
33507	33508	33499	33499	You	0	” “
33514	33523	33509	33509	I	0	” He gestured back and forth between us . “
33532	33533	33509	33509	I	0	” “
33539	33551	33552	33552	You	0	” I asked , although I knew exactly what he meant . “
33578	33579	33571	33571	We	628	” “
33589	33595	33581	33581	I	0	” He crossed his arms . “
33599	33613	33616	33616	Mack	1505	” I decided to be honest . Pretending was clearly not my thing . “
33629	33641	33616	33616	Mack	1505	” His arms came uncrossed and his solid chest stuck out . “
33656	33657	33654	33654	Frannie	248	” “
33676	33677	33654	33654	Frannie	248	” “
33694	33695	33685	33685	You	1505	” “
33745	33758	33738	33738	I’d	629	” His face softened , and his aggressive posture deflated a bit . “
33768	33778	33759	33759	You	1505	” Tears blurred my eyes , but I smiled . “
33809	33810	33811	33811	You	1505	” “
33827	33833	33823	33823	we	631	” I shook my head . “
33864	33870	33852	33852	you	1505	” Mack ’s jaw dropped . “
33907	33921	33923	33923	I	0	” Braver now , I came off the door and stood up taller . “
33961	33962	33951	33951	I’ve	0	” “
33970	34016	33963	33963	You	1505	” He came toward me , and for a moment , I thought he was going to take me in his arms . But at the last second , he reached beyond me for the door handle . Then he spoke low over his shoulder . “
34037	34119	34027	34027	I	0	” * * * An hour later , I was a solid twenty minutes into my ugly cry when I heard knocking on my door . For God ’s sake , now what ? I grabbed a handful of tissues on my way to the door and blew my nose before opening it . My sister Chloe stood in the hall . She ’d been about to say something , but at the sight of me , her eyes went wide . “
34123	34127	34120	34121	Jeez Louise	204	” she said . “
34133	34134	34120	34121	Jeez Louise	204	” “
34140	34150	34120	34121	Jeez Louise	204	” I asked , a little angrier than intended . “
34175	34176	34120	34121	Jeez Louise	204	” “
34181	34200	34120	34121	Jeez Louise	204	” I stomped back over to the tissue box on my kitchen counter and yanked another one out . “
34205	34227	34120	34121	Jeez Louise	204	” My sister came in and shut the door behind her . It was on the tip of my tongue to say “
34230	34287	34288	34288	You	204	” since I did n’t usually confide in her about stuff like this , nor did she in me , but while I blew my nose , I figured , what the hell ? Maybe we ’d have a closer relationship if I did tell her these things . And maybe she ’d have some advice . “
34294	34304	34305	34305	Scout	98	” I said . She held up three fingers . “
34309	34310	34305	34305	Scout	98	” “
34316	34328	34329	34329	You	204	” I told her . Her chin about hit the floor . “
34332	34333	34334	34334	I	0	” “
34339	34340	34334	34334	I	0	” “
34354	34372	34348	34348	I	0	” She sank onto a chair at my table as I stuffed soggy tissues into the trash . “
34381	34405	34408	34408	Chloe	59	” She made a fist with one hand and punched the palm of the other a few times . I rolled my eyes . “
34421	34422	34416	34416	You	204	” “
34430	34436	34425	34425	I	0	” She blinked at me . “
34445	34446	34439	34439	I	0	” “
34452	34470	34448	34448	I	0	” I asked , marching over to the table and dropping into the seat next to her . “
34480	34481	34473	34473	I	0	” “
34484	34489	34473	34473	I	0	” Then she shrugged . “
34501	34502	34492	34492	I	0	” “
34509	34513	34514	34514	I	0	” I snapped . “
34530	34531	34516	34518	a grown woman	0	” “
34536	34547	34548	34548	You	204	” she said , reaching over to pat my arm . “
34586	34587	34548	34548	You	204	” “
34597	34601	34593	34593	I	0	” I screeched . “
34605	34611	34593	34593	I	0	” She lifted her shoulders . “
34649	34660	34641	34641	You	204	” I felt more tears coming and fought them off . “
34685	34686	34687	34687	You	204	” “
34695	34700	34687	34687	You	204	” she murmured wryly . “
34707	34708	34709	34709	Mack	1505	” “
34711	34741	34709	34709	Mack	1505	” Hard to believe that less than twenty - four hours ago , I ’d been whispering his name while he was inside me . Chloe shook her head . “
34765	34766	34767	34767	She	52	” “
34770	34771	34767	34767	She	52	” “
34800	34804	34787	34787	she	52	” She laughed . “
34810	34811	34787	34787	she	52	” “
34814	34819	34787	34787	she	52	” I said miserably . “
34829	34830	34820	34820	I	0	” “
34837	34844	34820	34820	I	0	” Chloe punched her fist again . “
34876	34877	34862	34863	the girls	158	” “
34891	34900	34887	34887	he	636	” I wiped my nose on my sleeve . “
34936	34941	34942	34942	He	636	” My sister shrugged . “
34949	34955	34957	34957	he	636	” I glared at her . “
34978	34979	34969	34969	I	0	” “
34986	34987	34988	34988	I	0	” “
35031	35039	35040	35040	We	646	” I cringed , shaking my head . “
35086	35092	35078	35078	he	636	” She rolled her eyes . “
35102	35103	35078	35078	he	636	” “
35129	35150	35151	35151	He	636	” I got up and went for the tissue box again , trying to recall what else he ’d said . “
35180	35181	35171	35171	he	636	” “
35184	35200	35202	35202	he	636	” Chloe leaned her elbow on the table and propped her chin in her hand . “
35229	35235	35221	35221	He	636	” I blew my nose . “
35251	35252	35253	35253	I	0	” “
35259	35267	35257	35257	hon	650	” She gave me a sympathetic look . “
35276	35286	35257	35257	hon	650	” Sighing , I lowered myself into my chair . “
35306	35324	35301	35301	Sylvia	61	” Sylvia and Mack had gone to school together , and they ’d been pretty good friends . “
35346	35350	35338	35338	she	61	” She shrugged . “
35356	35362	35363	35363	I	0	” I shook my head . “
35367	35368	35363	35363	I	0	” “
35372	35373	35363	35363	I	0	” “
35389	35399	35400	35400	Frannie	248	” My sister sat up straight and nodded slowly . “
35441	35442	35431	35431	I	0	” “
35445	35450	35451	35451	I	0	” I said hesitantly . “
35481	35486	35451	35451	I	0	” She leaned forward . “
35498	35499	35451	35451	I	0	” “
35502	35511	35512	35512	You	248	” I felt embarrassed all of a sudden . “
35573	35584	35585	35585	she	0	“ I do n’t think it ’s stupid at all , ”
35589	35648	35585	35585	she	0	“ It feels that way to us too , sometimes . And a lot of it stems from when we were little . Mom and Dad were always so worried about you . They kept you apart from us a lot . We felt like you were in this bubble and we all had to be so careful . ”
35649	35654	35655	35655	I	0	“ I hate that , ”
35662	35748	35655	35655	I	0	“ I know I ca n’t be mad that they were so protective of me , but do you know how lonely it was , growing up like that ? I was n’t close to you guys , I did n’t have school friends , I spent tons of time in the hospital with only my parents and the nurses for company , and even after I was perfectly healthy , Mom and Dad wanted to keep me in that bubble . They still do ! ”
35749	35754	35755	35755	Chloe	59	“ I ’m sorry , ”
35758	35799	35755	35755	Chloe	59	“ Now I can see that it must have been lonely for you , but back then , we were all just trying to get some attention , and it did n’t seem like there was enough to go around . ”
35800	35807	35808	35808	I	0	“ You must have resented me , ”
35823	35833	35834	35834	Chloe	59	“ You were the baby until I came along . ”
35839	35874	35875	35875	I	0	“ It was n’t so much about not being the youngest anymore as it was just basically feeling ignored . My therapist thinks that ’s why I got into the pattern of acting out . ”
35882	35917	35875	35875	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Chloe . I ’ve thought about it a lot as I ’ve gotten older and wished things were different , but I did n’t know how to approach it . ”
35918	35921	35922	35922	She	59	“ Hey . ”
35929	35988	35989	35989	I	0	“ It was n’t your fault . I think my therapist is wrong about that anyway — I think being a shithead teenager was just in my blood . And we ca n’t change the past , but I definitely think we can be better in the future about talking openly and letting each other in a little . ”
35992	36008	36009	36009	She	59	“ I ’d like that . You guys have such great relationships with each other . ”
36012	36084	36009	36009	She	59	“ Sometimes . I mean , April and I are pretty close . Sylvia ’s been kind of distant for a while , but she ’s all wrapped up in her perfect life . And Meg , who the hell knows what she ’s thinking ? We ’re the closest in age , but I have n’t spoken to her in months . Mom ’s always complaining that she never calls . ”
36085	36094	36095	36095	She	59	“ Mom and I had an argument yesterday . ”
36099	36103	36104	36104	I	0	“ What about ? ”
36136	36145	36146	36146	she	59	“ I think it ’s a great idea , ”
36150	36180	36146	36146	she	59	“ Fuck Mom on this one . Really . I love her , but she needs to let go of you or eventually you ’re going to hate her . ”
36199	36209	36210	36210	She	59	“ Maybe I ’ll try talking to her again . ”
36214	36230	36231	36231	I	0	“ Do you need their help ? Because you certainly do n’t need their permission . ”
36242	36303	36231	36231	I	0	“ I might be able to do it on my own . Get a small business loan from the bank , or see what Mrs. Radley would be willing to invest . But it would be really hard for me to take on such a big venture without their support — and I ’m not talking only about financial support . ”
36309	36319	36304	36304	I	0	“ You probably think that ’s childish of me . ”
36320	36325	36326	36326	She	59	“ Not at all . ”
36334	36400	36401	36401	I	0	“ There ’s nothing wrong with wanting your family ’s support , and I agree it would be better for you to have it . So talk to Mom again . And get Dad in the room this time . I think he might be more willing to see your side . He ’s more logical — Mom ’s emotions get the best of her . ”
36404	36436	36401	36401	I	0	“ Thanks , that ’s good advice . I also think it would help if I went in armed with some actual numbers and statistics . Maybe even some possible locations . ”
36437	36440	36441	36441	Chloe	59	“ Definitely , ”
36444	36477	36441	36441	Chloe	59	“ I can help you there . Hey , have you eaten yet ? Why do n’t we get some food and just hang out here tonight ? Do a little research . ”
36478	36481	36482	36482	I	0	“ Okay . ”
36960	36971	36947	36947	I	0	“ So did you have a good time at Cloverleigh ? ”
36988	36999	37000	37000	I	0	“ Yes . The sleigh ride was so much fun . ”
37011	37018	37000	37000	I	0	“ Was that your favorite part ? ”
37019	37028	37000	37000	I	0	“ Yes . Can I have a horse ? ”
37029	37032	37033	37033	She	0	“ No . ”
37036	37051	37052	37052	I	0	“ I did n’t think so . Can we take another sleigh ride tomorrow ? ”
37076	37086	37061	37061	Her	0	“ Maybe not tomorrow , but sometime . Goodnight . ”
37087	37099	37061	37061	Her	0	“ Wait , Daddy ! Did you look under the bed ? ”
37100	37108	37061	37061	Her	0	“ Oh , sorry . I forgot . ”
37121	37130	37131	37131	She	0	“ All clear . Just some dust bunnies . ”
37134	37146	37131	37131	She	0	“ Those are okay . Kiss Ned the Hammerhead from Shedd . ”
37181	37189	37131	37131	She	0	“ That thing does not look cuddly . ”
37190	37212	37131	37131	She	0	“ I know , but I love him . I do n’t feel right if he ’s not next to me . ”
37213	37226	37131	37131	She	0	“ Then I guess he can stay . Love you , princess . ”
37227	37235	37131	37131	She	0	“ I love you too , Daddy . ”
37238	37270	37131	37131	She	0	” Leaving her door open the way she liked it , I went into Felicity ’s room . Her nightlight glowed in the dark , and she was under the covers . “
37273	37285	37131	37131	She	0	” I asked , sitting on the bed . She yawned . “
37288	37289	37131	37131	She	0	” “
37298	37299	37291	37291	you	678	” “

37316	37371	37372	37372	She	248	” I thought of her hurt expression from earlier and my chest felt tight . What would happen if she decided she did n’t want to nanny for me anymore ? Then the girls would lose her , and it would be my fault completely . God , I ’d really fucked this up . “
37393	37394	37379	37379	She	248	” “
37397	37398	37379	37379	She	248	” “
37425	37488	37417	37417	She	248	” She brought her hand out from under the covers and opened her fist . On her palm lay a small , smooth stone . I switched on the lamp on her nightstand and looked closer . It was a crystal of some sort , with streaks of purple and green and lavender running through it . The perfect gift for Felicity . “
37495	37509	37417	37417	She	248	” She closed her fist and tucked her arm beneath the blankets again . “
37517	37518	37417	37417	She	248	” “
37525	37539	37417	37417	She	248	” I switched off the lamp , leaned over and kissed her cheek . “
37544	37548	37542	37542	Mavis	40	” She giggled . “

37567	37580	37551	37551	Daddy	36	” Millie ’s bedroom door was closed , and I knocked gently . “
37584	37619	37551	37551	Daddy	36	” she said . When I opened the door , I saw her reading in bed by the light of the lamp on her nightstand . I went in and sat by her feet . “
37622	37623	37551	37551	Daddy	36	” “
37626	37637	37551	37551	Daddy	36	” She did n’t lift her eyes from her book . “

37679	37685	37672	37672	Dad	216	” she said , annoyed . “

37759	37829	37830	37830	Millie	37	” I did n’t believe her . Clearly there was an issue , but she was n’t going to tell me what it was . For a moment I panicked that it was something related to puberty , and I got lightheaded and sweaty . What the hell was I going to do when all those changes set in ? God , why could n’t they stay young forever ? “
37835	37846	37830	37830	Millie	37	” My voice cracked , and I cleared my throat . “

37884	37944	37945	37945	Dad	216	” I leaned over , kissed her head , and switched off her lamp . Her hair smelled sweet , too , but not like baby shampoo . More fruity . Like women ’s shampoo . Then I stood there a moment looking at her , wondering where the years had gone . It seemed like only yesterday that — “
37947	37948	37945	37945	Dad	216	” “
37951	37952	37945	37945	Dad	216	” “

38037	38463	38464	38464	Millie	37	” I felt a little better as I went downstairs , but not much . Millie ’s stomachaches , like Felicity ’s nightmares and Winifred ’s monsters , had begun after their mother left and usually flared any time Carla said she was coming to visit , even though she rarely followed through . In the kitchen , I went over to where Millie ’s phone was plugged in , picked it up , and entered her passcode . She and I had an agreement — I allowed her to have a phone , and she allowed me access to it at any time to make sure she was n’t on social media or texting with serial killers . Every now and then , I glanced at her messages , but mostly there were just long threads full of emojis between her and a few friends , and occasionally texts from her mother . When I saw that Carla had been in touch today , Millie ’s stomachache made sense . Hello darling , I just wanted to tell you how excited I am to come see you ! Remember not to say anything to your sisters so the visit can be a surprise ! I ’m only telling you because you sent me the note saying how much you miss me . It was so sweet of you to write me , but hearing that you are sad because of me made me feel sad too . I had a migraine for days afterward . I really wish I could be there for the mother daughter fashion show you mentioned , but that date is n’t good for me . But I will see you Friday and we ’ll have such a good time ! I set the phone down , my blood boiling . I ’d specifically asked Carla not to tell the kids about her visit , and she ’d gone behind my back immediately and messaged Millie . And how fucking dare she make Millie feel guilty for telling her mother she misses her ! Seething , I paced the kitchen . I wanted to punch something . Throw something . Destroy something . Opening the back door , I took a few gulps of icy air to calm myself down , but it barely had an effect . Then I came in the house and downed a shot of whiskey . Ten seconds later I was going up the stairs three at a time , then opening Millie ’s door . “

38946	38951	38918	38918	Mom	73	” Then I sighed . “

39133	39144	39131	39131	You	695	” I sat up tall and puffed out my chest . “
39162	39166	39159	39159	you	695	” She giggled . “
39170	39190	39167	39167	I	0	” Getting off the bed , I did my best John Travolta Saturday Night Fever strut across her room . “
39199	39200	39197	39197	Millsy	104	” “

39313	39351	39306	39306	we	703	” I said , pointing a finger at her . She smiled , and I almost felt like things were okay in the world again . Maybe I was n’t Superdad , but I was doing this . “
39357	40006	40009	40009	Daddy	36	” I blew her a kiss and headed for the door . Downstairs , I folded some laundry , stacked everyone ’s piles in baskets , and opened up my laptop on the dining room table . I emailed Sawyer and DeSantis that I would n’t be in tomorrow because of childcare issues , asked if meetings could please be rescheduled , and apologized for the late notice . Then I tried to tackle some of the work tasks that I ’d been unable to finish during the day , but I still found it hard to concentrate . At midnight , I finally gave up and went to bed , but even though I was tired , I could n’t fall asleep . I was mad at Carla , worried she would n’t show , worried she would show , concerned about Millie , fearful I was n’t handling her questions right , anxious about the future , and desperate to make things right with Frannie again . But how ? I could n’t go backward and undo what we ’d done . I could n’t unhear the words she ’d spoken . I could n’t unfeel this longing for her . But I could n’t act on it , either . My girls aside , Frannie deserved someone who could put her first , someone at the same stage of life she was in , who had all the time and energy in the world to dedicate to making her happy . I was awake half the night wishing that someone could be me . Frannie At the reception desk the next morning , I braced myself every time someone came in the front door of the inn , but Mack never showed up for work . Around noon , I casually asked my dad where he was , and he informed me that Mack had taken the day off . Even though I should have been glad I did n’t have to see him , I found myself wandering past his empty office anyway , feeling sad and lonely and torn . Had I made a mistake telling him how I really felt ? Had that only made things worse ? What if I ’d ruined things between us forever and we could never look each other in the eye again ? Later that evening , he texted me . Carla is coming to visit the kids on Friday . Can you still cover tomorrow ? There were so many other things I wanted to say to him , but in the end I replied with only one word . Yes . Three dots appeared on my screen , as if he were typing another message , but a few seconds later they disappeared , and no additional texts came through . Disappointed , I set my phone aside . Then I opened my laptop to do a little digging around about small business loans and read whatever advice I could find about being a young female entrepreneur . It felt good to spend my energy on something other than obsessing over Mack , but he was always there at the back of my mind . I spent the night hugging my pillow and trying not to cry into it . Thursday I picked up Winnie from school and went through the usual afternoon routine with the girls . I helped Millie with her bun for ballet class and waved her off when her carpool ride picked her up . She ’d seemed a little melancholy today , but her forehead did n’t feel hot , and she said she was fine . At about quarter after five , I was standing at the counter helping Felicity with her spelling words when I heard the back door open . My heart jumped into my throat . “
40011	40015	40009	40009	Daddy	36	” Felicity called . “
40020	40056	40018	40018	everyone	191	” A moment later , Mack entered the kitchen . My back was to him , but I felt short of breath , as if he ’d sucked up all the oxygen in the room . “
40061	40065	40018	40018	everyone	191	” he asked . “
40073	40092	40068	40068	I	0	” Felicity grinned , proudly displaying the new hole in her smile . Mack examined her teeth closely . “
40100	40101	40102	40102	I	0	” “
40113	40136	40137	40137	Millie	37	” I faced him , but I could n’t bring myself to meet his eye . Instead I looked at his chest . “
40148	40149	40142	40142	Winnie	461	” “
40152	40191	40193	40193	you	707	” Quickly I turned and headed for the back hall , shoved my feet into my boots , and threw on my coat . Without even bothering with gloves or a hat , I called a fake - cheerful “
40195	40485	40486	40486	She	708	” and rushed out . I could n’t even breathe until I was in my car , engine running . Later , I got a text from Mack . You left so fast I did n’t get a chance to pay you . I ’ll bring you a check tomorrow and leave it at the desk . I did n’t usually work at reception on Fridays . If I had orders for macarons for a weekend event , I got up early and spent the morning baking before picking up Winnie . However , there was no event scheduled at Cloverleigh that weekend and I did n’t even have to get Winnie , so my time would be totally free . I could easily go down to pick up a check from Mack . But that would necessitate a face - to - face conversation , and I was n’t sure I could handle it . That ’s fine . He did n’t write back . I used Friday to clean , do laundry , catch up on social media work , make some soup , and check in with April regarding the wedding schedule for the next few weeks . Ryan Woods ’s wedding was coming up , and originally I ’d been looking forward to the event — all the family on staff were invited since Ryan used to work for us — but now I found myself dreading it , since I knew Mack was the best man . I ’d probably spend the entire night staring at him across the room . April confirmed that they did want macarons as favors , and Stella ’s wedding colors were navy , cranberry , ivory and gold . “
40506	40507	40486	40486	She	708	” “
40517	40760	40761	40761	Frannie	248	” I was looking through recipes and trying to decide on flavors when my mom called to ask if I ’d mind taking the evening shift as hostess at the restaurant , since someone had called in sick . I said I ’d be glad to . What else did I have to do besides sit around and mope ? The thought annoyed me . I was only twenty - seven years old . Why did n’t I have a more interesting social life ? Or at least somewhere to go on a Friday night ? Valentine ’s Day was coming up next week . The inn would be full of romantic couples , which normally made me happy , but I found myself dreading it . I stayed good and aggravated as I showered and got ready for work . As I made my way down to the restaurant , I noticed it was snowing again . For fuck ’s sake , even snow reminded me of Mack now . Would winter never end ? I checked in with the floor manager at the restaurant and assumed my post at the hostess stand , trying not to frown at all the couples coming in for a romantic dinner . Evidently , I was n’t doing a very good job at it , because after a while my mother hurried across the lobby from the reception desk with creases in her forehead . “

40791	40800	40783	40783	I	0	” I snapped . She folded her arms . “

40898	40958	40863	40863	I	0	” I made a better effort to be warm and welcoming after that , and I was doing okay until I heard Mack ’s voice . Looking up from the stack of menus in front of me , I locked eyes with him as he and Henry DeSantis crossed the lobby . My heart beat faster as they approached . “
40963	40967	40961	40961	Frannie	248	” Henry said . “
40978	40979	40863	40863	I	0	” “
40982	40995	40863	40863	I	0	” I offered Henry a smile , tearing my gaze from Mack . “

41023	41028	41002	41002	We	254	” Mack spoke up . “
41041	41055	41039	41039	Frannie	248	” My smile faded as I forced myself to meet his eyes again . “
41058	41059	41060	41060	We	254	” “
41075	41079	41060	41060	We	254	” Henry said . “

41090	41098	41060	41060	We	254	” I tried hard to sound cheerful . “
41101	41343	41344	41344	Frannie	248	” They moved past me , and I caught a whiff of Mack ’s scent — it nearly made my knees buckle . And he looked so good in that shade of blue . It matched his eyes . Why ’d he have to be so handsome ? Several times over the next hour , I peeked into the bar area and spied on them . It was n’t easy since they ’d taken two seats at the far end of the bar , but twice I was able to make up an excuse to go into the kitchen . That meant I had to walk by them four times . The first time , I was careful to make no eye contact whatsoever . The second time , Mack happened to notice me , and our eyes met . Neither of us smiled . The third time , I noticed they ’d decided to eat at the bar , and both had ordered steaks . The final time , Henry must have gone to the bathroom or something , because Mack was sitting by himself . He looked at me as I passed him , and I refused to make eye contact . Then he said my name . I pretended like I had n’t heard him and walked faster , my heels clacking on the wood floor . Next thing I knew , a hand was on my shoulder . “
41346	41351	41344	41344	Frannie	248	” he said again . “
41356	41368	41344	41344	Frannie	248	” I turned to face him , reluctantly meeting his eyes . “

41383	41392	41376	41376	I	0	” He shoved his hands in his pockets . “

41409	41417	41418	41418	She	715	” He grimaced and shook his head . “
41423	41434	41435	41435	She	715	” I gasped , although it did n’t surprise me . “
41439	41440	41435	41435	She	715	” “
41470	41471	41460	41460	She	715	” “

41536	41545	41530	41530	Millie	37	” He rubbed the back of his neck . “

41715	41720	41690	41690	I	0	” He nodded slowly . “

41738	41760	41761	41761	I	0	” I sighed , feeling embarrassed that I ’d turned this into a thing that was making us both feel awkward . “
41781	41782	41774	41774	I	0	” “
41785	42159	41774	41774	I	0	” He opened his mouth like he might say something else , and I could have thought of any number of things I wanted to hear . Do n’t go . I ’m sorry . I changed my mind . But a second later , he closed it again , and I walked away . What else could I do ? * * * The inn ’s dinner crowd was a pretty early one in the winter , so the floor manager let me go by nine - thirty . Mack and Henry still had n’t come out of the bar , and I was glad I did n’t have to see him again before I left . After finishing up the hostess ’s side work , I said goodnight to my mom at reception , picked up Mack ’s check , and went up to my suite . Tossing the check onto my dresser , I changed from my work clothes into flannel pajama pants , a giant gray sweatshirt with a sherpa - lined hood , and fuzzy socks . After throwing my hair into a sloppy bun on the top of my head , I went into the kitchen to warm up a bowl of the squash soup I ’d made earlier . But I was n’t very hungry and only ended up eating about half of it . I was rinsing out the bowl when I heard a knock at my door . That ’s weird , I thought , checking my phone to see what time it was — after ten — and whether someone in my family had tried to get ahold of me . No one had . My heart tripped a little faster as I made my way to the door , and I held my breath as I pulled it open . Mack stood in the hall , his hands fisted at his sides , his expression tense . He was breathing hard , as if he ’d just run up a steep flight of stairs . Suddenly I was mad at him . How dare he show up here ? He knew I was trying to avoid him . This just felt mean . “
42165	42176	42177	42177	I	0	” I asked , not bothering to disguise my anger . “
42186	42194	42177	42177	I	0	” He spoke quietly , but firmly . “
42197	42524	42525	42525	Jesus	74	” I told him , folding my arms over my chest . Without another word , he rushed toward me and crushed his lips to mine . Mack Things happened fast . I kicked the door shut with my heel . I backed her into the room . I tore at her clothes , and then my own , although I only succeeded in removing her hoodie and pants , and though I was shirtless , my jeans were still tight around my knees . Did n’t matter . Within five minutes of arriving at her door , I was fucking her mercilessly on the living room carpet , driving my rock - hard cock into her soft , warm body again and again and again . It was almost like I was punishing her for refusing to let me be . And she clearly wanted to punish me too . She wrapped her legs around me and clawed at my back . She whispered my name against my lips and cried out with every deep , hard thrust . She moved beneath me , rocking her hips in tandem with mine , pulling me closer to her body until we were gasping and shuddering and clinging desperately to each other through a simultaneous orgasm so intense , I could n’t breathe , could n’t see , could n’t think . It was obvious the other night had n’t been a fluke — whatever this thing was between us was real . And powerful . And not going anywhere . When I finally opened my eyes , I saw her face beneath mine . She turned her head to the side , giving me her profile , chin slightly raised . Then I realized she was n’t holding on to me anymore . Fuck . I was such an asshole . I detached myself from her and sat back on my heels , head hanging low . “

42583	42613	42556	42556	you	74	” She did n’t , so I put two fingers beneath her chin and turned her head . Her lower lip trembled , and I had to kiss it . “
42616	42631	42556	42556	you	74	” she said softly . A smile hooked up one side of my mouth . “

42817	42822	42814	42814	I	0	” She looked amused . “

42836	42842	42823	42823	I	0	” I cleared my throat . “

42860	42879	42880	42880	I	0	” Her hands swept up and down my back , her touch sending warm shivers across my skin . “
42887	42888	42880	42880	I	0	” “
42897	42919	42880	42880	I	0	” I brushed some hair back from her forehead that had come loose from the knot on top of her head . “
42948	42949	42941	42941	I’ve	0	” “
42955	42967	42968	42968	You	74	” she said with that irresistibly stubborn tilt of her chin . “

43030	43036	43022	43022	I	0	” She took a breath . “
43049	43056	43057	43057	You	74	” I smiled down at her . “
43076	43098	43068	43068	I	0	” Suddenly I realized something — we had n’t been careful tonight . I panicked , backing off from her again . “
43113	43121	43111	43111	I	0	” She silenced me with one hand . “
43142	43148	43132	43132	I	0	” I relaxed a little . “
43157	43172	43132	43132	I	0	” The last thing I needed was another baby right now . Or ever . “
43181	43190	43132	43132	I	0	” she asked , getting to her feet . “
43221	43227	43210	43210	I	0	” I raised my brow . “
43235	43248	43229	43229	I	0	” Laughing , she gathered her clothing and headed for her room . “
43272	43273	43259	43259	I	0	” “
43281	43391	43259	43259	I	0	” I looked around and noticed the fireplace at the far end of the room . Scooping up my clothing , I threw on my underwear , jeans , and shirt and wandered into the kitchen . By the time Frannie came out of her bedroom , dressed the same way she had been before but with her hair loose around her shoulders , I ’d poured two glasses of whiskey and lit the gas fireplace , which lacked the romance of real wood in my opinion , but it warmed the room . She smiled as she joined me on the couch , tucking her legs beneath her . “
43396	43412	43259	43259	I	0	” I took her glass from the little coffee table and handed it to her . “
43432	43441	43420	43420	I	0	” She took a sip of her whiskey . “

43540	43553	43530	43530	I	0	” Frannie tipped up her glass again , then stared into it . “
43579	43583	43573	43573	you	739	” I nodded . “
43630	43641	43624	43624	They	742	” She looked up at me , her expression curious . “
43657	43667	43668	43668	My	0	” I exhaled and tossed back some more whiskey . “

43715	43719	43711	43711	Marines	745	” she asked . “

43930	43938	43926	43926	we	748	” I paused to take a drink . “
43961	43962	43948	43948	We	748	” “
43967	43974	43948	43948	We	748	” She took another small sip . “
44065	44074	44035	44035	She	0	” Frannie nodded slowly and took another sip . “
44091	44092	44084	44084	Sylvia	61	” “
44127	44128	44120	44120	She	0	” “

44240	44246	44236	44236	I	0	” I shook my head . “

44296	44305	44294	44294	Mack	1505	” She put a hand on my leg . “
44319	44403	44316	44316	your	761	” I ’d heard the same from my sister , from Woods , from my parents … but I could n’t convince myself of it . Rationally I knew it was n’t fair for Carla to blame me for the divorce , but her words had a way of eating at me deep down . Maybe I had n’t loved her the way I was supposed to . Maybe I did n’t know how . Frannie swirled the amber liquid in her glass . “
44414	44420	44404	44405	The girls	158	” I shook my head . “
44477	44478	44473	44473	they	158	” “
44486	44490	44492	44493	their therapist	765	” Frannie said . “
44495	44503	44504	44504	I	0	” I threw back some more whiskey . “
44532	44536	44539	44539	you	764	” Frannie gasped . “
44542	44543	44544	44544	I	0	” “
44568	44582	44583	44583	I	0	” I took another big swallow and ran a hand through my hair . “
44600	44601	44589	44589	I	0	” “
44604	44616	44617	44617	I	0	” she insisted , putting a hand on my leg again . “
44631	44747	44625	44625	You	764	” I smiled at her . Her cheeks were flushed and her hair was a mess , and some of her eye makeup from earlier was smudged under her eyes , but it did n’t matter . She still made my heart beat faster . And the way she was sitting there so patiently while I dumped out all my emotional garbage , the way she gave me all of her attention and said all the right things … it made me feel validated and understood in a way I had n’t in a long , long time . I did feel like I could tell her anything . But I ’d had enough talking . “
44750	44754	44625	44625	You	764	” I said . “
44796	44808	44792	44792	me	0	” Light danced in her eyes and she lifted her shoulders . “
44816	44817	44818	44818	Hmmm	107	” “
44820	44842	44818	44818	Hmmm	107	” I took one last sip of whiskey and set the empty glass on the table before reaching for hers too . “
44858	44918	44818	44818	Hmmm	107	” She giggled , letting me put her drink aside and pull her onto my lap the way she ’d been the other night , straddling my thighs . My shirt was unbuttoned and she immediately put her hands on my chest . God , it felt good to be touched that way . I ’d forgotten how good . “
44922	44926	44818	44818	Hmmm	107	” she asked . “
44941	45028	44818	44818	Hmmm	107	” She grinned devilishly before unzipping the sweatshirt she wore and tossing it aside . Then she hesitated , glancing at the fire , which was the only source of light in the room . At first I did n’t understand why , but when she tugged the little white tank over her head , I noticed the scar on her chest . Immediately I reached out and traced the long , ragged , dark pink line that ran down her sternum , between her breasts . “
45033	45042	44818	44818	Hmmm	107	” I asked . She shook her head . “
45049	45050	45051	45051	I	0	” “
45088	45089	45084	45084	I	0	” “
45094	45113	45114	45114	You	769	” I looked up at her with concern , placing my hands on the sides of her ribs . “
45119	45120	45121	45121	I	0	” “
45194	45195	45189	45192	a good little girl	771	” “
45198	45210	45211	45211	I	0	” I looked at the scar again , and she sighed . “
45227	45233	45219	45219	I	0	” I met her eyes . “
45245	45246	45219	45219	I	0	” “
45256	45371	45219	45219	I	0	” she whispered . Pulling her closer , I fastened my mouth to one perfect pink nipple , teasing the tip with my tongue . She threaded her hands into my hair and moaned softly , arching her back . My dick was hard again in no time . Lucky for me , she was just as hungry for more as I was , and she ditched her pants and yanked mine down inside a minute . I could n’t even speak as she sheathed my cock with her fist and moved it up and down , then licked her fingers and touched herself in a way that made my chin hit my chest . “
45376	45628	45629	45629	Mack	1505	” I whispered , glad this was round two or else I ’d have come all over myself in seconds . She lowered herself onto me slowly , her eyes shut , her mouth open . I put my hands on her hips and fought the urge to buck up beneath her . When I was buried inside her , she opened her eyes and looked at me as she started to move . At that moment , I did n’t care about the age difference or whose daughter she was or how I was going to add her to the chaotic mess that was my life . All I knew was how good it felt to be with her this way , to see the desire in her eyes , to watch her come apart above me , to be the man she saw when she looked at me , not the one I saw when I looked at myself . We went a little slower this time — probably because I let her set the pace for once . She did n’t race to the finish line , but the gradual buildup was just as intense , and the climax an even sweeter reward , our bodies pulsing together in perfect harmony . When it was over , she fell forward , her head on my shoulder , her chest heaving against mine . I wrapped my arms around her and inhaled the scent of her soft wavy hair . “
45631	45635	45629	45629	Mack	1505	” she whispered . “
45638	45639	45629	45629	Mack	1505	” “
45648	45801	45629	45629	Mack	1505	” I thought for a moment , realizing quickly that I did n’t want this fantasy to end so soon . Tonight , I was just a man going after what I wanted . What I needed . What felt good . When I walked out of here , it was back to real life . Who knew when I ’d have this chance again ? The truth was , I had no clue how this was going to work — how I would balance being who I needed to be with who I wanted to be . Maybe I was just setting myself up for another failure . Maybe it was stupid to think I could make this work . Maybe in a week she ’d realize that feeling like somebody to me was n’t worth the trouble and she ’d move on . But tonight … tonight could be ours . “
45804	45809	45629	45629	Mack	1505	” I told her . “
45817	45824	45629	45629	Mack	1505	” She picked up her head . “
45834	45835	45629	45629	Mack	1505	” “
45838	45848	45849	45849	I	0	” I said , pressing my lips to hers . “
45852	46106	45849	45849	I	0	” Frannie I had to work the next morning , although I ’d never been more tempted to call in sick . We ’d been up half the night . I was exhausted and sore and so hungry I could have eaten a bear . But I was giddy too — when I woke up , the first thing I did was look at the man sleeping next to me to make sure last night had n’t been a dream . Mack lay on his stomach with his head completely under the pillow . Suppressing a giggle , I carefully slid out of bed and jumped in the shower . The smile stayed on my face as I washed and conditioned my hair , soaped , rinsed , and dried off . Back in my bedroom , with the towel wrapped around me , I could n’t resist sneaking over to the bed and lifting up one corner of the pillow to peek at Mack ’s face . Even asleep , he was so handsome my heartbeat quickened . His profile was sharply defined and masculine , his jaw thick with scruff , his nose strong and straight . He slept with both arms over his head , and the muscles on his bare shoulders bulged thick and round . I was tempted to run my hand over them , but I did n’t want to wake him up . We ’d only been sleeping for about four hours . His eyes opened . “
46109	46115	45849	45849	I	0	” I whispered , smiling . “
46118	46139	46141	46141	I	0	” He grabbed the pillow I was holding up and stuffed it beneath his cheek , closing his eyes again . “
46144	46145	46141	46141	I	0	” “
46152	46153	46154	46154	I	0	” “
46177	46182	46171	46171	their	158	” My grin widened . “
46195	46196	46186	46186	they	158	” “

46234	46235	46227	46227	my	0	” “
46251	46264	46243	46243	I	0	” I brushed my fingertips over the silvery strands at his temples . “
46269	46283	46265	46265	You	0	” Opening his eyes again , he smiled and tugged at my towel . “
46289	46307	46308	46308	I	0	” Ditching the towel , I scrambled into his arms , loving his bare skin against mine . “
46315	46337	46338	46338	You	0	” I said reluctantly , tucking my wet head beneath his chin . He held me close and kissed my hairline . “
46343	46344	46338	46338	You	0	” “
46347	46351	46338	46338	You	0	” I sighed . “
46366	46367	46338	46338	You	0	” “
46414	46415	46416	46416	You	0	” “
46423	46435	46436	46436	You	0	” I dropped a kiss on his chest and sat up . “
46443	46444	46436	46436	You	0	” “
46447	46451	46436	46436	You	0	” I laughed . “
46454	46465	46466	46466	You	0	” He grinned , tucking his hands behind his head . “
46475	46490	46491	46491	Sheesh	108	” Wincing a little , I got out of bed and onto my feet . “
46506	46507	46500	46500	My	0	” “
46513	46522	46523	46523	I	0	” He sat up , his brow furrowed . “
46534	46538	46523	46523	I	0	” I grinned . “
46547	46622	46542	46542	I	0	” He yanked the pillow from behind his back and threw it at me . I caught it in two hands and whacked him across the shoulder with it , but before I could get away , he grabbed me and threw me down on the bed . I shrieked and struggled half - heartedly to get out from under him , but really I could n’t get enough of his body on mine . “
46638	46655	46542	46542	I	0	” he said , circling my wrists and pressing them into the mattress above my shoulders . “
46658	46671	46542	46542	I	0	” I asked breathlessly , thrilled to be one of his girls . “
46679	46680	46542	46542	I	0	” “
46700	46732	46733	46733	I	0	” I dissolved into a wriggling mess , laughing and squirming as he buried his face in my neck and swirled his tongue lightly over the skin just below my ears . “
46737	46741	46733	46733	I	0	” I gasped . “
46758	46759	46751	46751	I	0	” “
46765	46776	46777	46777	I	0	” He picked up his head and stared me down . “
46788	46789	46785	46785	you	0	” “
46822	46828	46829	46829	Your	0	” Then I laughed again . “
46843	46844	46829	46829	Your	0	” “
46849	46875	46876	46876	I	0	” He dove for my neck again , keeping my hands immobile and torturing my ticklish spot with his tongue until I pleaded for mercy . “
46886	46890	46881	46881	I	0	” I gasped . “
46920	46921	46911	46911	I	0	” “
46937	46941	46930	46930	I	0	” I laughed . “
46953	46954	46945	46945	Millie	37	” “
46977	46991	46973	46973	I	0	” He let go of my wrists and sat back on his heels . “
46997	46998	46999	46999	Mack	1505	” “
47027	47028	47029	47029	I	0	” “
47058	47084	47054	47054	me	0	” I did n’t really have time to mess around , but something about Mack offering to brush my hair was too sweet to resist . “
47087	47120	47054	47054	me	0	” In the bathroom , I grabbed my wet brush and threw on my robe . When I came out , Mack had pulled on his pants and was zipping them up . “
47125	47217	47122	47122	you	0	” I said , turning around and presenting him with a long , wet , knotted mess . He started at the ends and worked his way up , slowly and patiently . Since I stood facing the mirror above my dresser , I could see his reflection , and my heart beat faster at his serious expression . His long , gentle strokes across my scalp and down my back sent shivers up my spine . I did n’t care if I was late . This was totally worth it . “
47220	47224	47122	47122	you	0	” he said . “
47229	47230	47122	47122	you	0	” “
47233	47244	47245	47245	You	0	” We caught each other ’s eyes in the mirror . “
47258	47273	47274	47274	You	0	” He wrapped an arm around me and kissed the top of my head . “
47278	47302	47274	47274	You	0	” A few minutes later , we said goodbye at the door . He pulled me against his chest , hugging me tight . “
47312	47313	47310	47310	you	0	” “
47324	47340	47341	47341	I	0	” I looped my arms around his waist and pressed my cheek to his chest . “
47346	47347	47348	47348	I	0	” “
47359	47360	47348	47348	I	0	” “
47383	47384	47376	47376	We	286	” “
47389	47403	47386	47386	I	0	” He pulled back and looked down at me , his expression serious . “
47442	47443	47404	47405	Your family	1715	” “
47447	47448	47404	47405	Your family	1715	” “
47451	47461	47462	47462	I	0	” He tugged a strand of my wet hair . “
47479	47480	47470	47470	I	0	” “
47521	47527	47528	47528	You	1505	” He kissed my forehead . “
47536	47540	47528	47528	You	1505	” * * * “
47549	47565	47566	47566	I	0	” my mother remarked after she caught me humming a tune at the reception desk . “
47571	47673	47566	47566	I	0	” I ’d spent the entire morning at work mooning over him , replaying last night in my mind , and wondering when I ’d see him again . I ’d meant what I said to him about not wanting to be another responsibility . The last thing Mack needed was one more female making demands on his time and attention . But I also could n’t help the way I felt — every cell in my body was radiating with happiness . Near the end of my shift , Chloe poked her head out the door leading to the offices . “
47679	47685	47686	47686	She	73	” I shook my head . “
47704	47734	47696	47696	She	73	” She came all the way out the door and closed it behind her . Then she leaned back against it and crossed her arms . Her eyes gleamed . “
47737	47744	47696	47696	She	73	” I looked expectantly at her . “

47772	47773	47761	47763	some industry people	785	” “
47776	47802	47761	47763	some industry people	785	” Suddenly I had a feeling I knew where this was headed , and I busied myself cleaning the computer screen in front of me . “
47818	47819	47761	47763	some industry people	785	” “
47822	47823	47761	47763	some industry people	785	” “
47845	47846	47837	47837	Mack	1505	” “
47849	47858	47837	47837	Mack	1505	” I wiped repeatedly at a stubborn smudge . “
47885	47886	47880	47880	he	1505	” “
47889	47909	47880	47880	he	1505	” I said , but I felt the burn in my face and knew my cheeks were going scarlet . “
47912	47924	47880	47880	he	1505	” she hissed , thumping me several times on the shoulder . “
47944	47945	47942	47942	he	1505	” “
47948	47962	47942	47942	he	1505	” I admonished , glancing around to make sure no one had heard . “
47970	47989	47967	47967	he	1505	” She hopped up and sat on the reception desk , which we were not supposed to do . “
47994	47995	47967	47967	he	1505	” “
48008	48026	47967	47967	he	1505	” I tossed my paper towel in the trash and tucked the screen cleaner under the counter . “
48032	48046	47967	47967	he	1505	” She pouted but pushed herself off the desk and onto her feet . “
48049	48066	47967	47967	he	1505	” I scanned the lobby one more time , but did n’t see anyone I knew . “
48074	48078	48071	48071	He	1505	” Chloe gasped . “
48083	48084	48071	48071	He	1505	” “
48102	48103	48094	48094	I	0	” “
48114	48118	48108	48108	you	0	” She snorted . “
48129	48138	48108	48108	you	0	” A long , slow sigh escaped me . “
48141	48150	48108	48108	you	0	” Cracking up , she shook her head . “
48183	48184	48185	48185	I	0	” “
48193	48223	48228	48228	sis	0	” I said defensively , although the feelings I had for Mack were dizzying and breathtaking and all - consuming — exactly what I imagined love to be like . “
48230	48985	48228	48228	sis	0	” She thumped me on the shoulder before pulling the hallway door open , giving me a wry grin on her way out . I could n’t help grinning too . Around two , he texted me . Hey beautiful . How ’s your day ? I blushed and messaged back . Good . Not too busy . How ’s yours ? Good . Guess what ? My sister called and said the girls can stay another night . Apparently there is a very serious Junior Monopoly tournament happening . My stomach flipped over . Did that mean we could see each other again ? With shaky fingers , I texted back . That ’s nice of her . How does dinner and Netflix at my house sound ? Do n’t worry , I wo n’t cook . We ’ll get takeout . I laughed out loud before replying . Why do n’t I cook ? I ’ll get some groceries and meet you at your house . Seven ? Perfect . See you then . My shift at reception finished at three , and I went upstairs to my rooms and crashed on the couch immediately . When I woke up , it was already going on six , and I jumped up to go change . Trading my work clothes for jeans and a sweater ( and my utilitarian underwear for something lacy and cute ) , I quickly brushed my hair and freshened up my makeup . Just in case , I packed a tiny bag with a change of clothes , my toothbrush , and makeup remover . Double checking that my pills were in my purse , I threw the bag over my shoulder and headed out the door . On the way to Mack ’s house , I hit the grocery store and bought everything I ’d need to make stuffed shells . Not exactly gluten - free , but since Millie was n’t home tonight , I figured I ’d take the opportunity to cook pasta for him . I also bought a loaf of fresh Italian bread and ingredients for a garden salad and lemon - tarragon vinaigrette . Maybe I was showing off little , but it was n’t as if I would n’t enjoy every moment spent preparing dinner for us in his kitchen . I loved cooking and baking , and I rarely had anyone around to share meals with . Usually I ended up giving food away . Mack ’s house was dark when I pulled up at ten after seven , and I wondered if he was in the shower or something . I parked on the street , got the grocery bags from my trunk , and trudged through the snow to his front door . Putting one bag down and shifting the other to my hip , I knocked a few times . When he did n’t answer , I picked up the second bag and went around to the back of the house . The kitchen appeared dark too . I knocked again and even tried opening the back door , but it was locked . Huh . I set down both bags , pulled off my gloves , and checked my phone . Quarter after seven and no message or call from Mack . Double checking the earlier texts , I made sure I had n’t gotten the time wrong , but I hadn’t — I’d said seven , and he ’d said that was perfect . I hoped nothing was wrong . Biting my lip , I looked around . Garage door was shut , so I could n’t tell if his car was in there or not . Well , now what was I supposed to do ? I did n’t have a key . Should I wait in the car ? Go home ? Try to call him ? I decided to text first . Hey , I ’m here . Adding a smiley face emoji , I hit send . And waited . Nothing . My fingers were starting to freeze , so I left the groceries on the back porch , got back in the car , and tried again . Are you home ? I tried the front and back door , but both are locked . I waited about five minutes , turning the car on for the heat . Nothing . Then I tried calling . Straight to voicemail . “
49048	49383	49043	49043	I	0	” I drove home slowly , stopping at every yellow light , checking my phone often , and taking a circuitous route . But Mack never got in touch . Back at home , I unpacked the grocery bags and decided to cook the dinner I ’d planned on . When the shells were in the oven , I texted both April and Chloe , asking them if they wanted to come over for dinner . But Chloe was out with friends , and April had already gone home for the night and did n’t feel like making the drive . I ended up eating alone with the television on , but even a sappy Valentine ’s movie on the Hallmark channel did n’t ease my mind . What on earth had happened ? Was everyone okay ? Why had n’t he at least called ? By ten o’clock , the dishes were done and the leftovers put away , but I knew there was no way I ’d be able to sleep . I was too scared something awful had happened . My dinner was not sitting well in my stomach . Throwing my coat and boots on again , I jumped in my car and drove back to his house . As I turned onto his street , I noticed lights on in his living room window . Slowing down , I pulled up along the curb and put the car in park . What the hell ? Was he home ? Why had n’t he returned my messages ? I got out of the car , hurried up the driveway , and knocked on the back door . Mack I was prying the cap off a much - needed beer when I heard the knock . My gut clenched , and I went to answer it . As expected , it was Frannie . Her usual warm , friendly expression was a mixture of relief and what - the - fuck . “
49386	49391	49043	49043	I	0	” I said quietly . “
49396	49426	49043	49043	I	0	” She stepped into the house and I shut the door behind her . Crossing her arms over her chest , she eyed the beer bottle in my hand . “
49437	49438	49434	49434	you	795	” “
49445	49457	49443	49443	Winnie	461	” I said grimly . Frannie gasped and dropped her hands . “
49465	49466	49462	49462	she	461	” “
49499	49508	49469	49469	She	461	” Shaking my head , I exhaled heavily . “
49525	49526	49520	49520	She	461	” “
49535	49543	49520	49520	She	461	” Her pretty features contorted in sympathy . “

49593	49609	49586	49586	Frannie	248	” I said , pinching the bridge of my nose . My head was pounding . “
49620	49621	49586	49586	Frannie	248	” “
49634	49635	49631	49631	you	248	” “

49792	49810	49780	49780	I	0	” I wrapped my arms around her big puffy coat and kissed the top of her head . “
49830	49831	49780	49780	I	0	” “

49909	49950	49894	49894	I	0	” She stepped out of her boots and unzipped her coat , which I hung up for her . In the kitchen , I grabbed another beer from the fridge and popped the cap off before handing it to her . “
50018	50033	50034	50034	You	1505	” Frannie took a sip from her beer and leaned back against the counter . “
50061	50062	50063	50063	I	0	” “
50066	50104	50107	50107	she	811	” Rationally , I knew my unhinged excitement at another all - night fuck - a - thon with Frannie had n’t caused Winnie ’s accident , but something in my gut would not let me be . “
50147	50160	50141	50141	I	0	” I set my beer aside and pulled her into my arms . “
50166	50170	50162	50162	you	814	” She chuckled . “
50181	50191	50175	50175	I	0	” I leaned back and tipped her chin up . “
50200	50201	50202	50202	Me	0	” “
50209	50221	50202	50202	Me	0	” She kissed me and placed a hand on my chest . “
50282	50304	50277	50277	You	814	” There was no way that could be true , but my feelings for her deepened at hearing her say it . “
50307	50324	50277	50277	You	814	” My stomach chose that moment to rumble loudly , and she glanced down at it . “
50327	50328	50277	50277	You	814	” “
50331	50332	50277	50277	You	814	” “
50340	50357	50277	50277	You	814	” Setting her beer down , she went over to the refrigerator and pulled it open . “
50373	50374	50366	50366	I	0	” “
50380	50394	50395	50395	Spinach	111	” I asked , knowing it would be torture to hear the answer . “
50404	50411	50395	50395	Spinach	111	” I groaned long and loud . “
50418	50419	50395	50395	Spinach	111	” “
50423	50442	50395	50395	Spinach	111	” She rummaged around in my fridge and took out a few things I ’d bought earlier today . “
50455	50456	50451	50451	I	0	” “
50469	50483	50451	50451	I	0	” I told her as she set a cutting board on the counter . “
50502	50503	50490	50490	I	0	” “
50510	50519	50490	50490	I	0	” She began mincing a clove of garlic . “
50545	50546	50547	50547	Sliders	112	” “
50549	50570	50547	50547	Sliders	112	” I asked , eyeing the roast beef and provolone on the counter as my salivary glands went into overdrive . “
50604	50613	50592	50592	I	0	” She turned the oven on to preheat . “
50641	50731	50732	50732	You	821	” As I stood there watching her , my heart began to feel like a jackhammer in my chest . Clearing my throat , I headed for the pantry before I did something crazy like tell her I loved her . But honest to fucking God , I almost did . * * * Frannie sat at the dining room table with me while I ate , slowly sipping her beer and telling me about the conversation she ’d had with her sister Chloe about starting her own business . “
50743	50755	50735	50735	I	0	” I said between bites of the delectable roast beef sandwiches . “
50765	50766	50756	50756	I	0	” “
50769	50774	50756	50756	I	0	” She smiled gratefully . “
50801	50802	50786	50786	I	0	” “
50810	50814	50815	50815	I	0	” She sighed . “
50863	50864	50859	50859	I	0	” “
50874	50894	50859	50859	I	0	” She pulled one leg up , wrapping her arms around it and setting her chin on her knee . “
50917	50928	50929	50929	You	821	” I paused with a slider halfway to my mouth . “
50936	50937	50938	50938	I	0	” “

50984	50995	50969	50969	I	0	” I asked , surprised . She shook her head . “
51011	51019	50998	50998	I	0	” I reached for the last slider . “
51026	51027	51028	51028	Hmmm	107	” “
51030	51042	51028	51028	Hmmm	107	” She thought for a moment , pressing her lips together . “
51107	51108	51084	51084	he	832	” “
51112	51113	51084	51084	he	832	” “
51119	51127	51128	51128	He	832	” she said with perfect French pronunciation . “
51170	51183	51143	51143	he	832	” I laughed as I stuck the last bite in my mouth . “
51188	51196	51143	51143	he	832	” Giggling , she shook her head . “
51229	51230	51222	51222	I	0	” “
51253	51263	51241	51241	I	0	” I sat back and tipped up my beer . “
51277	51278	51279	51279	You	838	” “
51283	51288	51279	51279	You	838	” She smiled happily . “
51346	51347	51338	51338	she	154	” “
51352	51357	51338	51338	she	154	” I told her . “
51374	51378	51331	51331	she	154	” She laughed . “
51385	51402	51381	51381	We	840	” I finished my beer , picked up my plate and took it to the sink . “
51410	51422	51403	51403	I	0	” Frannie rose to her feet too , stifling a yawn . “
51434	51435	51429	51429	I	0	” “
51450	51665	51666	51666	You	841	” I touched her back as I passed her on my way to the stairs . Hurrying up to Winnie ’s room , I looked in on her , double checking that she was breathing easily and her lip had n’t started bleeding again . I picked Ned the Hammerhead from Shedd up from the floor , tucked him in next to her and pressed my lips to her forehead a moment , thanking God again that she was okay . I ’d never take the health and safety of anyone I loved for granted . I ’d seen too much for that . Quietly I left her room , leaving the door all the way open and the nightlight on in the hall . I ’d sleep in Winnie ’s room tonight just in case she woke up and called for me . But first I wanted to say goodnight to Frannie and walk her to her car . Downstairs , she was loading dishes into the dishwasher . Affection and gratitude for her overwhelmed me . What had I done to deserve the kind of devotion she showed me ? I came up behind her and wrapped my arms around her waist , burying my face in her sweet - smelling hair . “
51685	51693	51681	51681	you	841	” She placed her arms over mine . “
51700	51701	51681	51681	you	841	” “
51712	51718	51719	51719	Me	0	” I kissed her shoulder . “
51739	51789	51732	51732	Mack	1505	” One of my hands had wandered beneath her sweater , and the other had moved between her legs . The feel of her warm bare skin , of the heat beneath my palm , sent blood rushing through me . The crotch of my pants was growing tight . “
51794	51807	51732	51732	Mack	1505	” I whispered , rubbing her through the tight - fitting denim . “
51815	51846	51849	51849	God	1400	” She made one small sound of protest , but stopped when I undid her jeans and slid my hand inside her underwear , stroking her gently with my fingertips . “
51851	51855	51849	51849	God	1400	” she whispered . “
51861	51945	51849	51849	God	1400	” My other hand found her breast and I filled my palm with her perfect round flesh , then teased her pebbled nipple through the lace of her bra . That ’s when I noticed I could see our reflection in the window over the sink . Her eyes were closed and her mouth open as she began to writhe against my hand . By now I knew exactly how she liked to be touched , and I loved making her feel good . “
51957	51965	51955	51955	you	1400	” I spoke low in her ear . “
51980	52015	52016	52016	Mack	1505	” Her eyes flew open and she noticed our images on the glass against the darkness of night . I had no curtains or shade to hide behind . She struggled to get loose . “
52020	52025	52016	52016	Mack	1505	” she whispered frantically . “
52031	52032	52026	52026	Someone	186	” “
52057	52076	52046	52046	I	0	” Anchoring her in place with the arm across her chest , I slid two fingers inside her . “
52088	52089	52046	52046	I	0	” “
52092	52093	52046	52046	I	0	” “
52096	52135	52136	52136	I	0	” She was hot and wet , and I fucked her easily with my fingers . I knew from the way her hips were moving that her body wanted it , even as she told me to stop . “
52154	52166	52142	52142	I	0	” I told her , rubbing her clit hard and fast . “
52210	52269	52270	52271	Good girl	844	” Suddenly she cried out , her knees buckling , and she would have gone down if I had n’t been gripping her so tightly . I did my best to hold her up and keep my fingers moving until I was positive she ’d come , while she braced herself against the counter and gasped for air . “
52273	52283	52270	52271	Good girl	844	” I whispered , keeping her pinned against me . “
52290	52325	52270	52271	Good girl	844	” In the glass , I saw her eyes pop open and she watched as I brought my fingers to my mouth and sucked them clean . My cock bulged painfully in my jeans . “
52328	52335	52270	52271	Good girl	844	” I growled in her ear . “
52352	52353	52346	52346	you	844	” “
52356	52360	52346	52346	you	844	” she whispered . “
52363	52417	52346	52346	you	844	” I forgot all about my promise to move away from the window and yanked off her pants , and then mine . Taking my hot , swollen dick in my hand , I rubbed the tip over her plump little ass , then pushed inside her , making both of us moan . “
52421	52565	52346	52346	you	844	” I muttered through clenched teeth as I grabbed her hips and watched myself slide in deep . Frannie fell forward but kept her legs together , which made her feel even tighter around me . She whimpered and clutched at the edge of the counter as I fucked her harder and faster than I ’d intended to , but her ass was so perfect and her pussy so wet and her sounds were making me crazy and the taste of her was still on my tongue and in no time at all I was erupting inside her with the force of a nuclear blast . I felt young and powerful and virile — fucking invincible . When the spasms subsided , I pitched forward , covering her back with my chest . My pulse was thundering . My body rippled with aftershocks . “
52570	52574	52346	52346	you	844	” Frannie shivered . “
52580	52581	52346	52346	you	844	” “
52584	52585	52346	52346	you	844	” “
52598	52617	52346	52346	you	844	” she whispered , bending forward so far her cheek was resting on the edge of the sink . “
52623	52624	52618	52618	Someone	186	” “
52629	52634	52618	52618	Someone	186	” I assured her . “
52640	52644	52645	52645	She	43	” I laughed . “
52671	52672	52673	52673	She	848	” “
52676	52677	52673	52673	She	848	” “
52705	52726	52698	52698	She	848	” I carefully tried to disengage myself from her without making a mess , but did n’t have much luck . “
52736	52737	52698	52698	She	848	” “
52742	52756	52757	52757	I	0	” she said , scooping up her pants and hurrying for the bathroom . “
52763	52882	52757	52757	I	0	” While she was in the bathroom , I pulled my jeans back on and turned off the kitchen light . Standing there in the silent dark , I got a little nervous that I ’d been too rough and demanding with Frannie . Hopefully she was n’t traumatized . I was n’t even sure what had possessed me to say that stuff to her in the first place — I’d never really gotten off on sexual power play . But she brought it out in me . Maybe it was the age difference or something . Or maybe I was just an asshole . Shit . The bathroom door opened and she tiptoed into the darkened kitchen . “
52885	52898	52757	52757	I	0	” She looked so innocent and sweet , I felt even worse . “
52904	52905	52901	52901	You	852	” “
52909	52910	52901	52901	You	852	” “
52916	52917	52912	52912	I	0	” “
52920	52924	52912	52912	I	0	” She laughed . “
52933	52934	52935	52935	I	0	” “
52940	52949	52935	52935	I	0	” I rubbed the back of my neck . “
52969	52975	52976	52976	You	852	” She shook her head . “
52985	52986	52976	52976	You	852	” “
52989	53003	52976	52976	You	852	” I pulled her into my arms , loath to see her go . “
53019	53023	52976	52976	You	852	” She paused . “
53039	53067	53070	53071	little girl	854	” I twisted her around in my arms , binding her arms tight against her body so she could n’t escape , and whispered in her ear . “
53092	53096	53081	53081	you	852	” She giggled . “
53103	53107	53097	53097	You	852	” I groaned . “
53129	53130	53122	53122	I	0	” “
53134	53138	53122	53122	I	0	” she said . “
53147	53148	53122	53122	I	0	” “
53154	53193	53194	53194	You	852	” I whispered in her ear . * * * I warmed up her car while she put her boots and coat on , then I walked her down the icy drive , holding her hand in mine . “
53202	53217	53194	53194	You	852	” she said , shivering as we carefully made our way toward the street . “
53224	53225	53226	53226	I	0	” “
53230	53247	53226	53226	I	0	” I told her , watching our breath hit the frigid air in warm white puffs . “
53256	53257	53258	53258	Me	0	” “
53281	53282	53283	53283	Me	0	” “
53286	53295	53283	53283	Me	0	” I grumbled as we reached the car . “
53301	53302	53283	53283	Me	0	” “
53325	53326	53323	53323	them	856	” “
53350	53362	53406	53409	the mother - daughter	314	” I pulled open the driver ’s side door for her . “
53367	53378	53406	53409	the mother - daughter	314	” She gave me a quick peck on the lips . “
53388	53392	53406	53409	the mother - daughter	314	” I laughed . “
53419	53425	53412	53412	I	0	” She burst out laughing . “
53435	53436	53437	53437	Millie	37	” “
53439	53445	53446	53446	She	314	” I shook my head . “
53466	53467	53457	53457	I	0	” “
53472	53473	53457	53457	I	0	” “
53483	53484	53480	53480	I	0	” “
53492	53496	53480	53480	I	0	” She hesitated . “
53514	53518	53519	53519	You	0	” I grimaced . “
53560	53577	53578	53578	You	0	” She rose up on tiptoe and kissed me again , one hand on my cheek . “
53587	53588	53589	53589	I	0	” “
53592	53593	53594	53594	I	0	” “
53630	53636	53637	53637	You	0	” I shook my head . “
53657	53669	53648	53648	You	0	” She got behind the wheel and smiled up at me . “
53682	53683	53677	53677	You	0	” “
53689	53690	53677	53677	You	0	” “
53694	53825	53826	53826	You	0	” She pulled the door shut , buckled her seatbelt , and pulled away , blowing me a kiss over her shoulder . Shoving my hands into my pockets , I stood there in the frozen dark for a moment and watched her go , imagining the two of us alone in some tropical paradise . Lying on the sand . Kissing in the ocean . Walking along the beach in the moonlight . Endless nights in each other ’s arms , our bodies hot and tangled up in cool sheets . Not a care in the world . Too bad it could never fucking happen . Frannie Mack called before I was even out of bed the next morning , and the number on the screen was his cell . “
53831	53841	53826	53826	You	0	” I said , my voice low and gravelly . “
53854	53855	53826	53826	You	0	” “
53862	53863	53864	53864	She	461	” “
53879	53883	53873	53873	I	0	” He sighed . “
53914	53915	53903	53903	I	0	” “
53920	53932	53933	53933	I	0	” I swung my legs over the side of the bed . “
53943	53944	53933	53933	I	0	” “
53955	53978	53933	53933	I	0	” When I arrived at Mack ’s my hair was still damp . He met me in the kitchen and ruffled it . “
53986	53987	53980	53980	you	0	” “
54006	54010	53990	53990	I	0	” He smiled . “
54052	54053	54032	54032	she	461	” “
54056	54057	54032	54032	she	461	” “
54080	54094	54070	54070	she	461	” He grabbed his coat from the back hall and slipped it on . “
54108	54109	54116	54116	she	461	” “
54121	54129	54116	54116	she	461	” I reassured him with a smile . “
54139	54140	54116	54116	she	461	” “
54143	54202	54116	54116	she	461	” He gave me a grateful look and headed out . I spent the rest of the morning sitting on the couch with Winnie , trying to keep her mind off her poor stitched - up mouth . We watched Disney ’s Sleeping Beauty and I told her I knew someone who had grown up near the castle . “
54205	54211	54116	54116	she	461	” Her eyes went wide . “
54218	54227	54116	54116	she	461	” I nodded , widening my eyes too . “
54230	54231	54116	54116	she	461	” “
54237	54241	54116	54116	she	461	” she wondered . “
54244	54248	54249	54249	I	0	” I said . “
54260	54266	54258	54258	you	864	” I winked at her . “
54269	54334	54337	54337	she	0	” A little while later , I got her to take the Motrin but she refused to eat much more than a piece of bread with nothing on it . She did let me braid her hair , though , and she was asleep with her head on my lap when I heard Mack and the other two girls come in the back door . “
54340	54353	54354	54354	She	0	” Mack said , following Millie and Felicity into the living room . “
54358	54384	54354	54354	She	0	” I whispered , putting a finger over my lips so the girls would stay quiet . Millie noticed her sister ’s braids right away . “
54402	54403	54404	54404	I	0	” “
54409	54419	54404	54404	I	0	” piped up Felicity . Millie rolled her eyes . “
54438	54462	54463	54463	I	0	” Felicity started to cry , and Winnie woke up . Mack came over and helped her sit up , feeling her forehead . “
54474	54479	54472	54472	Felicity	38	” I told her . “
54493	54494	54472	54472	Felicity	38	” “
54505	54506	54497	54497	Daddy	36	” “
54513	54517	54497	54497	Daddy	36	” he said . “
54538	54542	54543	54543	I	0	” I laughed . “
54556	54596	54549	54549	I	0	” When all three girls had Dutch braids in their hair , I gave them each a hug goodbye and went into the kitchen , where Mack was pouring a can of tomato soup into a bowl for Winnie . “
54606	54611	54599	54599	I	0	” I told him . “
54618	54619	54620	54620	I	0	” “
54624	54625	54620	54620	I	0	” “
54635	54636	54620	54620	I	0	” “
54649	54667	54639	54639	I	0	” Covering the top of the bowl with a plate , he stuck it in the microwave . “
54717	54718	54709	54709	she	463	” “
54724	54725	54709	54709	she	463	” “
54748	54771	54709	54709	she	463	” After setting the cook time for three minutes , he took out his wallet and placed forty dollars on the counter . “
54784	54792	54709	54709	she	463	” I shoved it back toward him . “
54802	54803	54800	54800	Mack	1505	” “
54808	54814	54800	54800	Mack	1505	” He met my eyes . “
54838	54852	54828	54828	I	0	” He put his wallet away and pushed the bills toward me again . “
54856	54857	54828	54828	I	0	” “
54860	54865	54868	54868	friends	630	” I said stubbornly . “
54880	54918	54871	54871	friends	630	” I headed for the back hall , where I put on my boots and zipped up my coat . I was about to put on my gloves and hat when Mack joined me by the door . “
54921	54929	54871	54871	friends	630	” he whispered , grabbing my arm . “
54933	54994	54995	54995	We	869	” With a quick glance over his shoulder , he suddenly pulled me close and slanted his mouth over mine . His tongue swept between my lips . His arms twined around me , his hands roaming over my body . For ten full seconds , he kissed me so deeply I was breathless and dizzy when he broke away . “
55000	55105	54998	54998	friends	630	” he said , his voice low and firm . He winked before backing out of the hall and calling the girls to lunch . In a daze , I made my way to the car , not even feeling the frozen sting of the air on my cheeks . Later I found the two twenties in my coat pocket and realized what Mack had been doing there at the door . I burst out laughing and stuffed them back in . * * * Every Sunday evening , my mother made dinner for the family . My parents still lived in what we called “
55113	55215	54998	54998	friends	630	” some of which had been taken over and renovated into rooms for the inn after us kids moved out . But they kept plenty of rooms for themselves , including their kitchen , dining room , library , and family room downstairs , and the master bedroom and bath , and a guest suite on the second floor . Occasionally one or both of my sisters would n’t make it , especially if they were n’t at the inn already . But tonight they were both there . Chloe cornered me in the dining room as we set the table . “
55218	55227	54998	54998	friends	630	” she whispered , glancing toward the kitchen . “
55231	55250	55251	55251	I	0	” I could n’t hide a smile as I placed a fork to the left of each plate . “
55261	55266	55251	55251	I	0	” Her jaw dropped . “
55276	55277	55383	55383	I	0	” “
55293	55309	55283	55284	the girls	158	” Then I stopped . What had it been ? Not a date , really . “
55314	55326	55283	55284	the girls	158	” Chloe snorted , setting a wine glass at each place . “
55340	55341	55283	55284	the girls	158	” “
55348	55363	55283	55284	the girls	158	” I paused , debating whether to go on , then thought fuck it . “
55368	55377	55283	55284	the girls	158	” Chloe stopped moving and blinked at me . “
55387	55388	55383	55383	I	0	” “
55391	55411	55383	55383	I	0	” I glanced behind me to make sure Mom and April were still chattering away in the next room . “
55423	55445	55418	55418	Winnie	461	” I told her about the accident at their aunt ’s house as I set the rest of the silverware out . “
55454	55479	55447	55448	my God	1400	” she said , pulling a corkscrew from the sideboard ’s top drawer . She worked the cork free from a bottle of wine . “
55491	55492	55447	55448	my God	1400	” “
55496	55500	55501	55501	He	878	” I confirmed . “
55532	55533	55524	55524	I	0	” “
55538	55565	55524	55524	I	0	” April breezed in carrying a platter of broiled salmon and set it on the table . Chloe and I exchanged a wide - eyed look . “
55568	55587	55524	55524	I	0	” I mumbled . April folded her arms and looked back and forth between the two of us . “
55597	55636	55595	55595	Spill	117	” Twisting my fingers together at my waist , I leaned over and looked past April to make sure our mother was still busy in the kitchen , and she was , bickering with my dad over something . “
55653	55654	55595	55595	Spill	117	” “
55664	55668	55669	55669	Mack	1505	” I grinned . “
55671	55683	55669	55669	Mack	1505	” Her mouth fell open and then she looked at Chloe . “
55692	55695	55696	55696	I	0	“ Shhhhh , ”
55699	55731	55696	55696	I	0	“ You were . But it ’s very new and it ’s kind of tricky because of all the circumstances . I do n’t want Mom and Dad to know yet . ”
55732	55742	55696	55696	I	0	“ Why not ? I think it ’s great . ”
55743	55750	55751	55751	I	0	“ It feels great so far , ”
55759	55767	55751	55751	I	0	“ But there are kids involved and — ”
55768	55776	55777	55778	my mother	204	“ What ’s this little powwow about ? ”
55792	55799	55800	55800	April	52	“ Ryan and Stella ’s wedding , ”
55804	55824	55800	55800	April	52	“ Frannie is making macarons , and she was just telling me which flavors she ’s going to make . ”
55832	55845	55825	55825	I	0	“ I ’m thinking chocolate , crème brulée , and red velvet . ”
55846	55849	55850	55850	She	204	“ Perfect . ”
56040	56043	56038	56038	he	1505	“ Frannie , ”
56064	56083	56038	56038	he	1505	“ What on earth are you doing ? I ’ve asked you three times to pass the potatoes . ”
56084	56089	56090	56090	Flustered	118	“ Oh ! Sorry . ”
56106	56115	56116	56116	April	52	“ I was just thinking about the wedding . ”
56121	56144	56145	56145	she	204	“ When I talked to Emme Pearson yesterday — that ’s Stella ’s sister , she ’s a wedding planner in Detroit , ”
56151	56170	56145	56145	she	204	“ she was raving about your macarons and hoping you ’d open up your business to shipping downstate . ”
56171	56176	56177	56177	Chloe	59	“ That ’s awesome , ”
56186	56209	56177	56177	Chloe	59	“ But you ’d probably need your own space for that , right ? A bigger kitchen and maybe a storefront somewhere ? ”
56230	56253	56254	56254	she	204	“ We ’ve already settled this . I do n’t think Frannie has the time or energy for that sort of thing , ”
56257	56295	56254	56254	she	204	“ She ’s so busy here at the inn , plus being a nanny to Mack ’s girls . That ’s really all she can do . In fact , I think she could use more downtime . ”
56296	56309	56311	56311	Chloe	59	“ Well , I think we should let Frannie speak for herself , ”
56313	56316	56317	56317	I	0	“ Actually , ”
56327	56340	56317	56317	I	0	“ Starting my own business is something I would like to discuss . ”
56341	56361	56362	56362	Mom	73	“ But you do n’t know the first thing about it , and running a business is very stressful . ”
56373	56389	56362	56362	Mom	73	“ Stress is dangerous for Frannie . John , do n’t you agree with me ? ”
56402	56408	56362	56362	Mom	73	“ What sort of business ? ”
56409	56414	56415	56415	I	0	“ A macarons shop , ”
56426	56432	56415	56415	I	0	“ Something small and upscale . ”
56433	56458	56459	56460	my mother	1406	“ Frannie , your doctors have made it very clear that you need lots of rest and should avoid unnecessary risks to your heart , ”
56464	56475	56459	56460	my mother	1406	“ Mom , they meant risks like smoking and obesity . ”
56500	56507	56508	56508	she	1406	“ Stress is a risk factor , ”
56517	56527	56508	56508	she	1406	“ John , can you help me out here ? ”
56528	56538	56539	56539	My	0	“ Stress is a risk factor . I agree . ”
56548	56572	56539	56539	My	0	“ Your mother and I are n’t saying we would n’t support you , we just want you to be safe and healthy . ”
56573	56580	56581	56581	April	52	“ Frannie ’s not a baby , ”
56584	56623	56581	56581	April	52	“ Why ca n’t she decide what ’s safe and healthy for her ? I think it ’s a great idea . And what if the shop was on the Cloverleigh premises ? You could invest in it ! ”
56624	56634	56635	56635	I	0	“ I do n’t want it on the premises . ”
56640	56664	56635	56635	I	0	“ I want my own thing in my own place . And I do n’t need anyone else ’s money to do it . ”
56665	56673	56674	56675	my mother	204	“ Frannie , do n’t be silly , ”
56678	56692	56674	56675	my mother	204	“ Where on earth would you get the money to open a business ? ”
56693	56710	56711	56711	She	204	“ It ’s called a bank , Mom . I ’d get a small business loan . ”
56719	56736	56711	56711	She	204	“ Enough . You ’re not starting a business . You ’ve got enough going on . ”
56737	56748	56674	56675	my mother	204	“ Stop it ! I ’m not a child anymore . ”
56782	56798	56762	56762	I	0	“ I ’m an adult , and it ’s time I started acting like one . ”
56799	56805	56806	56807	My mother	204	“ What does that mean ? ”
56814	56829	56806	56807	My mother	204	“ It means that maybe I need to move out and start supporting myself . ”
56862	56866	56867	56867	she	204	“ Move out ! ”
56870	56886	56867	56867	she	204	“ Why would you do that ? You ’d have to pay rent anywhere else . ”
56887	56909	56910	56910	I	0	“ That ’s the point . What other twenty - seven - year - old woman still lives with her parents ? ”
56917	56950	56910	56910	I	0	“ My sisters all left home and chased their own dreams . And even if those dreams brought them right back here , it was their choice . I want a choice . ”
56951	56961	56963	56964	my dad	216	“ What if we charged you a fair rent ? ”
56966	56975	56963	56964	my dad	216	“ John , you ca n’t be serious ! ”
56984	56992	56963	56964	my dad	216	“ We ’re not charging her rent . ”
56993	57003	57004	57004	he	216	“ It ’s better than seeing her move out , ”
57008	57011	57004	57004	he	216	“ Frannie , ”
57018	57033	57012	57013	my mother	204	“ you know I only worry about you because I love you so much . ”
57034	57106	57107	57107	Unable	119	“ I know , Mom . But that love has become a little bit overbearing . I feel smothered and trapped by it . You ’ve got to let go a little , okay ? You ’ve got to trust that I know how to take care of myself . I need some freedom to do my own thing , even if it ’s a mistake . Even if I fail . ”
57125	57165	57112	57112	I	0	“ I ’m not doing this to hurt you , and I ’m grateful for everything you do for me . I love it here . But I need more , and I need it on my own terms . ”
57172	57190	57166	57166	I	0	“ Thanks for the offer about the rent , Dad . I ’ll give it some thought . ”
57798	57808	57791	57791	She	918	“ I said I ’d text you dirty things . ”
57809	57813	57814	57814	I	0	“ Fuck that , ”
57838	57860	57861	57861	Her	918	“ If you ’re gon na talk filthy to me , I want to hear you do it . So talk . ”
57868	57872	57861	57861	Her	918	“ So bossy . ”
57873	57880	57861	57861	Her	918	“ You know you like it . ”
57881	57889	57890	57890	she	918	“ You ’re right . I do , ”
57893	57900	57901	57901	I	0	“ Where are you right now ? ”
57918	57935	57901	57901	I	0	“ I ’m lying in bed . And I ’m not wearing a stitch of clothing . ”
57950	57954	57901	57901	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
57955	57985	57901	57901	I	0	“ Because every night when I go to bed , I pretend you ’re next to me . And you like to get your hands on my bare skin . ”
57986	57998	57999	57999	She	918	“ That ’s not all I like on your bare skin . ”
58007	58037	57999	57999	She	918	“ No . You like your mouth on me too . I lie here and touch all the places on my body where I want to feel your tongue . ”
58038	58043	58044	58044	I	0	“ Do it now , ”
58053	58057	58044	58044	I	0	“ Touch yourself . ”
58058	58061	58062	58062	she	918	“ Where ? ”
58065	58069	58044	58044	I	0	“ Tell me . ”
58070	58083	58084	58084	I	0	“ Your tits . Your stomach . Your thighs . Your pussy . ”
58113	58119	58120	58120	she	918	“ It feels so good , ”
58123	58134	58120	58120	she	918	“ And just hearing your voice makes me so hot . ”
58135	58140	58120	58120	she	918	“ Are you wet ? ”
58141	58156	58120	58120	she	918	“ You know I am . Because you ’re fucking me with your tongue . ”
58196	58204	58187	58187	I	0	“ Tell me to make you come . ”
58205	58208	58209	58209	she	918	“ Mack , ”

58247	58251	58252	58252	I	0	“ Fuck yes . ”
58270	58299	58300	58300	Her	918	“ And then you do it faster , and harder , and my hands are in your hair and I ’m going to come so hard for you … ”
58366	58373	58374	58374	I	0	“ I need to fuck you , ”
58378	58381	58374	58374	I	0	“ Now . ”
58382	58388	58389	58389	she	918	“ Yes . Do it , ”
58393	58399	58389	58389	she	918	“ And do n’t stop . ”
58400	58428	58374	58374	I	0	“ God , my cock is so hard for you . And you ’re so wet , and so tight , and you take it so deep … ”
58429	58435	58436	58436	she	918	“ I can feel you , ”
58439	58481	58374	58374	I	0	“ I love the way you move , the way you fill me up , the way your body is so heavy on mine . I love your big , hard cock inside me , so deep I want to scream . ”

58535	58603	58604	58604	she	918	“ I love it when you ’re rough with me . When you tell me what to do . When you take control and make me feel like I ’m powerless against you . When you fuck me so hard I ca n’t even breathe , and all I want to do is feel you come . I want every last drop . Give it to me , ”
58662	58668	58658	58658	her	918	“ Are you still there ? ”
58669	58674	58675	58675	My	0	“ I think so . ”
58682	58690	58675	58675	My	0	“ Fuck . That was so hot . ”
58691	58704	58658	58658	her	918	“ It was . But I still wish you were really here . ”
58705	58712	58658	58658	her	918	“ I know . Me too . ”
58722	58733	58734	58734	She	918	“ Shit . I hope I was n’t too loud . ”
58737	58741	58734	58734	She	918	“ Me too . ”
58742	58755	58734	58734	She	918	“ Give me a minute . I ’ll call you right back . ”
58756	58759	58734	58734	She	918	“ Okay . ”
58851	58864	58846	58846	I	0	“ Hey , sorry . Just wanted to check on the kids . ”
58865	58875	58846	58846	I	0	“ That ’s okay . Are they all right ? ”
58876	58881	58882	58882	I	0	“ They ’re fine . ”
58891	58926	58927	58927	She	37	“ But I should take a quick shower and go up to Winnie ’s room , although I ’ll probably end up sleeping on the floor in there because her bed is so small . ”
58931	58956	58957	58957	I	0	“ Poor thing . I ’d tell you I ’ve got plenty of room in my bed , but that probably would n’t help . ”
58960	58967	58957	58957	I	0	“ No , it does n’t . ”
58968	58985	58957	58957	I	0	“ Well , the spot next to me is yours any time you can get away . ”
58986	58998	58957	58957	I	0	“ Thanks . I wish I knew when that would be . ”
58999	59008	59009	59009	she	37	“ What about the night of the wedding ? ”
59013	59028	59009	59009	she	37	“ Yeah , my folks will be here then . That ’s a possibility . ”
59029	59042	59043	59043	she	37	“ Do n’t worry , I wo n’t get my hopes up , ”
59047	59054	59009	59009	she	37	“ It ’s just an idea . ”
59055	59060	59061	59061	I	0	“ I like it . ”
59064	59073	59009	59009	she	37	“ Let me see what I can do . ”
59074	59077	59078	59078	She	37	“ Okay . ”
59084	59094	59078	59078	She	37	“ You tired me out from clear across town . ”
59095	59110	59009	59009	she	37	“ Here ’s where I make a joke about how big my dick is . ”
59111	59117	59118	59118	she	37	“ It ’s no joke , ”
59121	59143	59009	59009	she	37	“ And I ’ll be thinking about it every night about this time until I can have you to myself again . ”
59144	59157	59078	59078	She	37	“ You really do want to torture me , do n’t you ? ”
59158	59161	59162	59162	She	37	“ Yes . ”
59166	59195	59162	59162	She	37	“ And no . I just want to be with you , that ’s all . I know this is brand new , but it feels really good . ”
59196	59200	59009	59009	she	37	“ It does . ”
59201	59238	59009	59009	she	37	“ So forgive me if I get a little carried away . I ’ve had these feelings for you for so long , I hardly remember a time when you did n’t make my heart pound . ”
59239	59242	59162	59162	She	37	“ Really ? ”
59243	59258	59259	59259	I	0	“ Really . But I was convinced you only saw me as a kid . ”
59262	59310	59259	59259	I	0	“ Nope . I mean , I thought you were too young and way off limits , but I remember last year at the Christmas party wanting to throw you over my shoulder , take you back to my office , and fuck you on my desk . ”
59311	59314	59315	59315	she	0	“ What ? ”
59318	59324	59259	59259	I	0	“ You never said anything ! ”
59325	59334	59335	59335	I	0	“ What the hell would I have said ? ”
59340	59358	59335	59335	I	0	“ Your parents were in the room . And my kids . And everyone we work with . ”
59359	59378	59259	59259	I	0	“ I guess . But jeez . I wish I would have known . You hid it well . ”
59379	59396	59259	59259	I	0	“ I had to . I told myself it was wrong to want you that way . ”
59397	59405	59406	59406	she	0	“ Have you changed your mind yet ? ”
59410	59417	59418	59418	I	0	“ That ’s a good question . ”
59424	59464	59418	59418	I	0	“ Yes and no . I ’m still worried about what your parents will think . And I worry about what will happen when you realize I ’m not worth all the shit you have to put up with . ”
59465	59473	59474	59474	she	0	“ What do you think will happen ? ”
59477	59489	59490	59490	I	0	“ You ’ll move on because you know you deserve better , ”
59494	59508	59490	59490	I	0	“ And I ’ll let you , because I ’ll know it too . ”
59517	59550	59514	59514	I	0	“ If that ’s what you think , then you do n’t know me very well , Declan MacAllister . So I guess it ’s up to me to prove you wrong . ”
59562	59565	59551	59551	I	0	“ Okay . ”
59566	59573	59574	59574	She	0	“ I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”

60028	60031	60032	60032	she	0	“ Great , ”
60042	60047	60032	60032	she	0	“ Got a minute ? ”
60048	60052	60053	60053	I	0	“ Of course . ”
60067	60076	60077	60077	She	0	“ Come on in . Take a seat . ”
60113	60117	60119	60119	her	0	“ But first . ”
60206	60211	60202	60202	I	0	“ We better stop . ”
60212	60215	60216	60216	she	0	“ Right , ”
60251	60259	60260	60260	Her	0	“ What can I do for you ? ”
60277	60309	60265	60265	she	0	“ Mrs. Radley , the bride who said she was interested in helping me start a business , just dropped this off . She was in a hurry , but look . ”

60475	60479	60480	60480	She	121	“ You think ? ”
60486	60522	60480	60480	She	121	“ I want to — I’m just nervous . I have n’t gotten a chance to tell you this yet , but I told my parents what I want to do Sunday night at dinner . ”
60523	60533	60534	60534	She	121	“ Good for you . What did they say ? ”
60539	60593	60534	60534	She	121	“ They gave me a bunch of shit about it , especially my mother . But I did n’t back down . I told them it ’s what I want to do , and it ’s time I start making decisions based on what I think I ’m capable of , not them . ”
60604	60615	60616	60616	She	121	“ I ’m impressed . How ’d they take it ? ”
60621	60660	60661	60661	I	0	“ Not awesome . I threatened to move out too , which I had n’t planned on doing , but I was getting pretty fired up about wanting my independence . My dad suggested I start paying rent . ”
60666	60672	60661	60661	I	0	“ What did you say ? ”
60673	60754	60824	60825	the woman	947	“ I said thanks but no thanks . Not that I would n’t pay rent , of course , and I will , but that that ’s not what I meant . All my sisters got the chance to go to school , travel , accomplish their goals . They were n’t held back , and I do n’t want to be held back either anymore . If I fail , I fail , but I ’ve got to try . ”
60755	60800	60801	60801	She	947	“ As a father , you ’re scaring the piss out of me right now . As someone who wants to see you kick ass out in the world , I ’m happy as fuck and I want you to go call this woman . ”
60804	60812	60813	60813	I	0	“ Thanks . I ’m going to . ”

60857	60869	60847	60847	she	947	“ What if she asks questions I have no answers to ? ”
60870	60877	60824	60825	the woman	947	“ Hey . Listen to me . ”
60895	60926	60885	60885	I	0	“ You are smart , talented , and persistent . If you do n’t know the answer to something , you ’ll find it . And you ’re not alone . ”

61002	61011	60971	60971	Her	947	“ Tell me again that I have you . ”
61012	61017	61022	61022	she	947	“ You have me . ”
61029	61036	61022	61022	she	947	“ That ’s all I want . ”
61158	61162	61153	61153	I	0	“ Come in . ”
61175	61188	61163	61163	Chloe	59	“ Hey , what do you think of this ad copy for — ”
61246	61252	61253	61253	Chloe	59	“ Am I interrupting something ? ”
61259	61262	61263	61263	we	950	“ No , ”
61272	61279	61269	61269	She	59	“ You guys are horrible liars . ”
61280	61286	61287	61287	Frannie	120	“ I was just going , ”
61315	61323	61299	61299	She	59	“ I ’ll talk to you later . ”
61324	61327	61328	61328	Chloe	59	“ Okay , ”
61343	61346	61347	61347	she	59	“ Well , ”
61350	61359	61360	61360	I	0	“ It ’s not what it looks like , ”
61369	61380	61381	61381	Chloe	59	“ Actually , it ’s exactly what it looks like . ”
61386	61413	61381	61381	Chloe	59	“ Do n’t look so scared , Mack . I think it ’s fantastic . Frannie needs somebody like you . It ’s good for her . ”
61422	61445	61446	61446	She	59	“ I do n’t know about that . I keep thinking your dad is going to come after me with a shotgun . ”
61457	61505	61446	61446	She	59	“ Nah . It ’ll take him all of two seconds to see how crazy Frannie is about you . And what Frannie wants , Frannie gets . All she has to do is turn those big green eyes at him , and he ’s a goner . ”
61513	61521	61522	61522	Frannie	1505	“ Yeah . I know the feeling . ”
61661	61664	61665	61665	She	121	“ Hello ? ”
61674	61686	61665	61665	She	121	“ Hi , Mrs. Radley , this is Frannie Sawyer from — ”
61687	61700	61668	61668	she	121	“ Frannie Sawyer , how are you ? You got my note ? ”
61701	61714	61665	61665	She	121	“ Yes . I’m — I was really glad you came in . ”
61715	61784	61785	61785	She	958	“ Well , I ’m telling you , Frannie , this is meant . To . Be . My entire honeymoon , I kept thinking of what I could do for you , and then the very morning I get back to the office , I got a phone call from the daughter of a friend of my mother ’s . They were in pageants together or something . ”
61788	61849	61785	61785	She	958	“ Anyway , this girl , her name is Natalie Haas , has owned this little coffee shop downtown for years and it ’s doing really well , but she ’s got a two - year - old son and she ’s pregnant again , and apparently she runs another restaurant as well , so she needs to cut back . ”
61850	61858	61859	61859	I	0	“ What ’s the name of it ? ”
61870	61874	61785	61785	She	958	“ Coffee Darling . ”
61875	61883	61884	61884	I	0	“ Oh , I know that place ! ”
61887	61899	61884	61884	I	0	“ It ’s adorable . That ’s the shop for sale ? ”
61900	61953	61954	61954	My	0	“ Well , she ’s not sure if she should sell the building , which she does own , or try to find a reliable tenant . She was looking for advice . Her dream scenario , actually , is to find someone to partner with . I thought of you immediately . ”
61961	61969	61954	61954	My	0	“ Did you tell her about me ? ”
61970	62016	62026	62026	I	0	“ Not yet . But I just could n’t help thinking that with her experience , and all the equipment in place , plus a built - in clientele , and your fresh new ideas and youth and energy — I see a home run . ”
62017	62025	62026	62026	I	0	“ I ’d love to meet her , ”
62030	62075	62076	62076	I	0	“ Great ! I ’ll set up a meeting . In the meantime , why do n’t you see if you can get down there and check out the spot ? Look at it with your vision in mind and see what you think . ”
62081	62088	62076	62076	I	0	“ I ’ll definitely do that . ”
62089	62114	62122	62122	I	0	“ Perfect . I have to run , dear , but I ’ll be in touch as soon as I connect with Natalie again . ”
62115	62121	62122	62122	I	0	“ Thank you so much , ”
62610	62619	62600	62601	My father	643	“ Hey , peanut . Come on in . ”
62620	62628	62600	62601	My father	643	“ Hi , Dad . Mom around ? ”
62629	62643	62644	62644	I	0	“ Yeah . She ’s in the kitchen harassing me about retirement again . ”
62669	62674	62675	62675	I	0	“ Hey , Mom , ”
62682	62686	62675	62675	I	0	“ Smells good . ”
62687	62694	62695	62695	she	204	“ I made chicken and rice , ”
62698	62707	62695	62695	she	204	“ Do you want to eat with us ? ”
62708	62711	62712	62712	I	0	“ Sure . ”
62807	62821	62822	62822	I	0	“ I thought we might talk again about my opening a pastry shop , ”
62825	62831	62822	62822	I	0	“ I have some news . ”
62853	62856	62851	62851	Mack	1505	“ Hello ? ”
62857	62871	62835	62835	My	0	“ Hey . Sorry it took so long for me to call back . ”
62872	62877	62878	62878	I	0	“ That ’s okay . ”
62890	62896	62878	62878	I	0	“ How was your night ? ”
62897	62902	62904	62904	he	1505	“ It was fine . ”
62908	62929	62904	62904	he	1505	“ I took them to therapy , then out for some dinner , but Winnie is still struggling to eat . ”
62930	62934	62851	62851	Mack	1505	“ Poor thing . ”
62935	62983	62984	62984	I	0	“ Then Felicity freaked out that she did n’t have enough valentines for her entire class , so I had to run out to the drugstore . And Millie ’s eye - rolling is out of control , but all in all , not a terrible night . ”
62987	63016	62984	62984	I	0	“ Do n’t take it to heart . She ’s at that age . Eye - rolling is sort of an automatic reaction to anything your dad says . ”
63022	63033	62984	62984	I	0	“ I ’m not looking forward to the teenage years . ”
63034	63050	62904	62904	he	1505	“ Maybe it wo n’t be so bad . I was n’t a sassy teenager . ”
63051	63054	62904	62904	he	1505	“ No ? ”
63055	63096	63097	63097	I	0	“ No , but that might have been a reaction to Chloe . She was as sassy as they come , and I saw how my parents struggled . I think I was trying to be the anti - Chloe . ”
63100	63106	63097	63097	I	0	“ I was a pleaser . ”
63107	63112	63113	63113	I	0	“ You still are . ”
63116	63121	63113	63113	I	0	“ But guess what ? ”
63122	63125	62984	62984	I	0	“ What ? ”
63126	63150	63113	63113	I	0	“ I talked to Maxima Radley , and it went really well . Then I went down to tell my parents about it . ”
63151	63154	63113	63113	I	0	“ And ? ”
63155	63197	62984	62984	I	0	“ And I convinced them that if they really loved me , they would support me in this . I told them that I was doing this with or without their support , but I ’d much prefer to have it . ”
63198	63204	63113	63113	I	0	“ What did they say ? ”
63205	63241	63113	63113	I	0	“ My dad asked me some practical questions . My mother mostly gave me the silent treatment . But in the end , it was my father who talked her into easing up on me . ”
63242	63247	62984	62984	I	0	“ Really ? How ? ”
63248	63341	63342	63342	I	0	“ It was pretty incredible . He said he ’d been thinking about it all last night and all day today . He reminded her of how her family — which was wealthy and old money — had treated her when she announced she wanted to marry a guy she ’d met at college who ran a family farm up north . And how they told her it was beneath her to run an inn . And how everyone told them they were crazy to buy more land and plant a vineyard . ”
63355	63440	63342	63342	I	0	“ Then he took her hand and reminded her how they ’d always agreed that raising children was the hardest , most important job they ’d ever do … but that the job was over . That even though they ’re still parents , their children were all grown , and they had to trust that they ’d raised smart , kind , responsible people unafraid to face the world and chase their dreams . Otherwise , he said , they ’d have failed . ”
63441	63450	62984	62984	I	0	“ Wow . How ’d she take it ? ”
63451	63528	63529	63529	He	216	“ She shed a few tears . But in the end , she came around . She admitted that maybe her clinging to me had more to do with herself than with me . Her identity for so many years has been wrapped up in being an overprotective mother . Once that ’s gone , she fears feeling lost . She does n’t know what the next phase of her life is supposed to look like . ”
63535	63542	63529	63529	He	216	“ I can relate to that . ”
63543	63586	63342	63342	I	0	“ My dad told her it can look like anything she wants it to . He said maybe they should stop talking about traveling more and do it . Enjoy the years they ’ve got left while they still feel young enough . ”
63587	63593	63594	63594	I	0	“ What did she say ? ”
63597	63669	63594	63594	I	0	“ She said three things . One , she ’d love to travel more , especially to see her grandchildren . Two , she said it only works if he agrees to step back from work a bit , so he should really get a plan in place for his retirement . And three , she said she wants more grandchildren in her life . Then she gave me a look . ”
63670	63679	63529	63529	He	216	“ A look ? What kind of look ? ”
63680	63700	63701	63701	He	985	“ A look that says , Is there any hope of you giving me a grandchild in the future ? ”
63704	63721	63701	63701	He	985	“ You ’ve got three other sisters . How come the pressure ’s all on you ? ”
63722	63775	63594	63594	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Maybe she figures April would have started a family if she ’d wanted one by now ? Or that Meg is too much of a career woman ? Or that Chloe ca n’t be trusted to raise kids that are n’t little hellions like she was ? ”
63776	63783	63701	63701	He	985	“ Do you even want kids ? ”
63784	63789	63790	63790	I	0	“ Oh , definitely , ”
63793	63833	63701	63701	He	985	“ I ’ve always wanted them . And I ’ve asked the doctor if there ’s any reason I might have a difficult time because of my heart , and he said no . I can absolutely have kids . ”
63834	63842	63843	63843	I	0	“ That ’s … that ’s good . ”
63856	63868	63869	63869	He	986	“ Do n’t worry . I ’m not in a rush . ”
63872	63878	63879	63879	I	0	“ That ’s even better . ”
63916	63943	63908	63909	Natalie Haas	123	“ Oh yeah , I know that place . I think she was a Nixon . Sylvia and I graduated with her older sister , Jillian . ”
63944	63958	63959	63959	I	0	“ Really ? Cool , I ’ll mention that when I meet her . ”
63972	63991	63959	63959	I	0	“ I do n’t want to jinx myself , but I have such a good feeling about this . ”
63992	63995	63908	63909	Natalie Haas	123	“ Good . ”
63996	64012	63959	63959	I	0	“ I ’m going to go check out the space as soon as I can . ”
64013	64023	63959	63959	I	0	“ I ’m really happy for you , Frannie . ”
64024	64033	63908	63909	Natalie Haas	123	“ Thanks . I ’m happy for myself . ”
64034	64044	64055	64055	he	987	“ Oh , shit . Hold on a sec . ”
64059	64089	64055	64055	he	987	“ I ’m sorry , I have to go . Winnie is up . She heard something under her bed , so I have to go check for monsters . ”
64090	64108	64055	64055	he	987	“ That ’s okay . Give her a hug from me . I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
64109	64114	64115	64115	I	0	“ See you tomorrow . ”
64548	64554	64539	64539	I	0	“ Is that fucking glitter ? ”
64578	64599	64562	64562	Millie	37	“ Yes , but do n’t worry . When we shake it off , there wo n’t be so much . ”
64621	64631	64632	64632	I	0	“ And what are you laughing at , huh ? ”
64643	64662	64632	64632	I	0	“ Maybe I will take you up on that offer to be in this show instead of me . ”
64663	64667	64668	64668	she	37	“ No way , ”
64671	64677	64632	64632	I	0	“ You made a promise . ”
64678	64683	64684	64684	Millie	37	“ That ’s right . ”
64698	64705	64684	64684	Millie	37	“ And it was your idea . ”
64706	64712	64713	64713	I	0	“ I need a beer , ”
64716	64723	64724	64724	Frannie	1505	“ I made dinner for you , ”
64732	64741	64724	64724	Frannie	1505	“ It ’s in the oven keeping warm . ”
64742	64758	64759	64759	She	37	“ Is that what smells so good ? You did n’t have to do that . ”
64762	64774	64759	64759	She	37	“ It ’s just a casserole . Not a big deal . ”
64775	64789	64724	64724	Frannie	1505	“ It is . And I appreciate it . Have the girls eaten ? ”
64790	64808	64759	64759	She	37	“ Yes , so I ’ll get going . Bye , girls . Happy Valentine ’s Day ! ”
64809	64815	64816	64816	they	1391	“ Happy Valentine ’s Day ! ”
64923	64929	64930	64930	she	37	“ What are you doing ? ”
64941	64955	64930	64930	she	37	“ I ’m stealing thirty seconds alone with you for Valentine ’s Day . ”
64963	64980	64981	64981	She	37	“ This is what it ’s like to be my valentine . Is n’t it romantic ? ”
64984	64987	64981	64981	She	37	“ Totally . ”
64988	65012	64981	64981	She	37	“ I wish we had some time alone . And I should have gotten something for you . Flowers or chocolate or something . ”
65013	65027	64981	64981	She	37	“ I do n’t want gifts , Mack . I just want you . ”
65028	65047	65048	65048	She	37	“ But I ca n’t even give you that . Not the way I want to , anyway . ”
65056	65063	65048	65048	She	37	“ Shut up and kiss me . ”
65106	65114	65115	65115	she	37	“ What are you doing in there ? ”
65118	65126	65127	65127	I	0	“ I was … changing a lightbulb , ”
65147	65155	65127	65127	I	0	“ Oh good . It works now . ”
65156	65162	65163	65163	Winnie	461	“ What was Frannie doing ? ”
65177	65182	65183	65183	Frannie	1505	“ I was helping , ”
65198	65206	65207	65207	Winnie	461	“ Can you help him make dessert ? ”
65211	65223	65207	65207	Winnie	461	“ No , she ’s got things to do , Winn . ”
65236	65243	65224	65224	I	0	“ We ’ll see her tomorrow . ”
65244	65247	65248	65248	Frannie	1505	“ Bye . ”
65267	65272	65261	65261	she	37	“ See you tomorrow . ”
65654	65660	65646	65646	she	314	“ Well , good morning , ”
65675	65683	65661	65662	Daphne Sawyer	86	“ And who ’s the lucky lady ? ”
65694	65733	65689	65689	I	0	“ Um , they ’re for Frannie , actually . She ’s been so great with the kids , and she stayed late and made dinner yesterday … I just wanted to let her know I appreciate her . ”
65738	65769	65689	65689	I	0	“ How nice . She ’s not working this morning , but she ’s at home as far as I know . Why do n’t you bring them to her ? ”
65770	65777	65778	65778	I	0	“ Maybe I will , thanks . ”
66016	66019	66020	66020	she	204	“ Hey , ”
66027	66035	66020	66020	she	204	“ What are you doing up here ? ”
66036	66042	66043	66043	I	0	“ I brought you something . ”
66052	66058	66049	66049	She	204	“ What ’s this for ? ”
66059	66070	66020	66020	she	204	“ For Valentine ’s Day . For everything you do . ”
66095	66108	66109	66109	She	204	“ You did n’t have to do that . But thank you . ”
66120	66136	66109	66109	She	204	“ I wish I ’d have known you were coming . I ’m a mess . ”
66137	66142	66143	66143	I	0	“ You ’re perfect . ”
66149	66164	66167	66167	she	204	“ But I do think even I could do a better bun than that . ”
66174	66182	66167	66167	she	204	“ Now you ’re just getting cocky . ”
66183	66192	66167	66167	she	204	“ Oh , I ’ve always been that . ”
66193	66199	66200	66200	she	204	“ Want to come in ? ”
66203	66214	66200	66200	she	204	“ Or do you have to get back to work ? ”
66215	66221	66222	66222	I	0	“ I should get back , ”
66226	66233	66234	66234	She	204	“ Just for a few minutes ? ”
66247	66275	66242	66242	she	204	“ Okay . A few minutes , but that ’s really all I have . I ’m meeting with your dad and DeSantis in half an hour . ”
66276	66286	66289	66289	she	204	“ I promise to kick you out by then . ”
66306	66315	66316	66316	She	204	“ Let me grab a vase for these . ”
66341	66347	66330	66330	she	204	“ Awww . Thank you . ”
66348	66382	66334	66334	her	204	“ You ’re welcome . It ’s not much , but I wanted you to know I was thinking of you . And how lucky I am to have you in my life . ”
66383	66389	66330	66330	she	204	“ I feel the same . ”
66390	66405	66330	66330	she	204	“ Your mom saw me with the flowers and asked who they were for . ”
66411	66418	66330	66330	she	204	“ What did you tell her ? ”
66419	66425	66334	66334	her	204	“ The truth , actually . ”
66436	66440	66429	66429	I	0	“ You did ? ”
66458	66465	66466	66466	I	0	“ That makes me so happy ! ”
66484	66489	66466	66466	I	0	“ I ’m glad . ”
66490	66496	66497	66497	Frannie	1505	“ Was my mother surprised ? ”
66500	66517	66497	66497	Frannie	1505	“ Not as much as I thought she would be . She seemed fine with it . ”
66518	66523	66525	66525	she	204	“ I told you . ”
66529	66536	66525	66525	she	204	“ Mmm . You smell good . ”
66537	66550	66497	66497	Frannie	1505	“ You smell good too . I could eat you right now . ”
66712	66716	66706	66706	Frannie	1505	“ Good timing . ”
66717	66730	66706	66706	Frannie	1505	“ Does that mean you have to get out of this bed ? ”
66731	66736	66706	66706	Frannie	1505	“ Yes , unfortunately . ”
66737	66745	66706	66706	Frannie	1505	“ I do n’t want you to . ”
66746	66753	66706	66706	Frannie	1505	“ I ’ll come right back . ”
66807	66815	66816	66816	she	204	“ I only have a few minutes , ”
66825	66837	66838	66838	I	0	“ And so do you . What time is your meeting ? ”
66842	66856	66838	66838	I	0	“ Fuck ! I forgot about that . What time is it now ? ”
66857	66864	66816	66816	she	204	“ A few minutes to ten . ”
66865	66868	66869	66869	I	0	“ Shit ! ”
66881	66888	66889	66889	Frannie	1505	“ My meeting is at ten . ”
66899	66913	66889	66889	Frannie	1505	“ Sorry . I guess I was supposed to boot you out sooner . ”
66937	66974	66975	66975	She	204	“ Yes . This is all your fault . If you had n’t smelled so good or been so fucking cute when you answered the door , I ’d have been on time for my meeting . ”
66998	67005	67008	67008	she	204	“ You ’re asking for it . ”
67017	67022	67008	67008	she	204	“ Hard and often . ”
67038	67052	67008	67008	she	204	“ Fuck , I have to go . I wish I did n’t . ”
67053	67057	67058	67058	She	204	“ Me too . ”
67071	67083	67058	67058	She	204	“ It ’s so nice to be alone with you again . ”
67084	67108	67008	67008	she	204	“ I ’m sorry . I feel bad we ca n’t be like normal people and do this during non - working hours . ”
67109	67114	67115	67115	She	204	“ It ’s okay . ”
67118	67128	67115	67115	She	204	“ It ’s kind of fun to sneak around . ”
67129	67143	67144	67144	I	0	“ Except I ’m late for a meeting with your dad right now , ”
67161	67173	67115	67115	She	204	“ And I look like I just got out of bed . ”
67201	67210	67211	67211	she	204	“ I ’ll see you at home tonight , ”
67224	67231	67211	67211	she	204	“ Thanks again for the flowers ! ”
67232	67237	67238	67238	I	0	“ You ’re welcome ! ”
67529	67534	67523	67523	Felicity	38	“ I miss Frannie . ”
67535	67539	67541	67541	Winnie	461	“ Me too , ”
67543	67550	67541	67541	Winnie	461	“ I wish she was here . ”
67551	67559	67560	67560	Millie	37	“ Can we call her , Dad ? ”
67568	67583	67563	67563	I	0	“ No , she ’s working tonight . We ’ll see her next week . ”
67584	67596	67597	67597	Winnie	461	“ Maybe she could come over tomorrow and do braids again , ”
67600	67608	67610	67610	Millie	37	“ And help me with my shirts , ”
67621	67627	67610	67610	Millie	37	“ I ’ll text her . ”
67628	67636	67637	67637	I	0	“ No , do n’t do that . ”
67660	67680	67681	67681	I	0	“ Let ’s let her have the weekend to herself , okay ? She ’s probably tired of us . ”
67837	67865	67832	67832	she	37	“ Hi . Sorry I missed you . Chloe needed help tonight , so I ’m pouring wine at this stupid corporate thing in the tasting room . ”
67866	67880	67881	67881	She	37	“ Guess that means you ’re not going to talk dirty to me . ”
67884	67897	67881	67881	She	37	“ Probably not . Might be awkward . How was your day ? ”
67898	67905	67906	67906	I	0	“ Good . Nothing too exciting . ”
67914	67928	67906	67906	I	0	“ The girls missed you at dinner . They wanted to call you . ”
67929	67942	67881	67881	She	37	“ Awww . I ’m sorry . This weekend is crazy here . ”
67943	67955	67956	67956	I	0	“ I know . I told them you had to work . ”
67987	67994	67956	67956	I	0	“ I should let you go . ”
67995	68007	67956	67956	I	0	“ Okay . Give me a call tomorrow if you can ? ”
68008	68012	68013	68013	I	0	“ I will , ”
68141	68160	68132	68132	her	37	“ Yeah , it ’s supposed to be mother - daughter , but they said Daddy can participate . ”
68165	68179	68162	68162	she	37	“ We have to make our own outfits . Frannie is helping me . ”
68209	68219	68220	68220	Millie	37	“ Okay . I love you too . Bye . ”
68227	68236	68237	68237	she	37	“ Can I have a little screen time ? ”
68240	68244	68245	68245	She	37	“ Shower first . ”
68248	68252	68253	68253	I	0	“ Got it . ”
68267	68272	68253	68253	I	0	“ Hi , Mom . ”
68273	68282	68253	68253	I	0	“ Hi , sweetie . How are you ? ”
68283	68290	68253	68253	I	0	“ Good . Busy . You ? ”
68291	68301	68253	68253	I	0	“ Great . We ’re excited for our visit . ”
68302	68307	68253	68253	I	0	“ We are too . ”
68349	68354	68342	68342	I	0	“ You arrive tomorrow ? ”
68355	68383	68332	68332	she	204	“ Yes . We ’ll stay at Jodie ’s for two nights , then we ’ll drive down to you for three . Does that still work ? ”
68384	68419	68332	68332	she	204	“ Yeah , that ’s perfect . The wedding is n’t until Saturday , but I have the rehearsal Friday , and I ’m supposed to spend some time with Woods on Thursday night . ”
68420	68432	68342	68342	I	0	“ And who ’s the bride ? Do I know her ? ”
68433	68445	68446	68447	My mother	204	“ She ’s Ruth Gardner ’s granddaughter . Lives in Detroit . ”
68452	68465	68446	68447	My mother	204	“ Oh , I just love Ruthie Gardner . How is she ? ”
68466	68471	68492	68492	I	0	“ She ’s fine . ”
68472	68491	68492	68492	I	0	“ And what about you ? The girls told me it was quite a week . Poor Winnie ! ”
68495	68498	68492	68492	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
68499	68508	68513	68513	her	204	“ They all talked a lot about Frannie . ”
68521	68538	68513	68513	her	204	“ Yes . She ’s been helping out a lot . She ’s great with them . ”
68539	68546	68492	68492	I	0	“ Sounds like they adore her . ”
68547	68551	68513	68513	her	204	“ They do . ”
68552	68566	68568	68568	I	0	“ And it seems like she spends a lot of time with them . ”
68593	68623	68624	68625	My mother	204	“ Well , Miriam Ingersoll broke her leg a couple weeks ago , so Frannie had to fill in . They saw a little more of her than usual . ”
68628	68643	68644	68644	Her	204	“ Oh , no ! Poor Miriam . Thank goodness you had extra help . ”
68650	68664	68665	68665	I	0	“ I hear Frannie is doing more than just babysitting at your house . ”
68669	68676	68665	68665	I	0	“ What ? Who said that ? ”
68677	68686	68665	68665	I	0	“ Felicity said she ’s been cooking dinner . ”
68687	68690	68691	68691	I	0	“ Oh . ”
68696	68706	68691	68691	I	0	“ Yeah . Sometimes , if I work late . ”
68707	68715	68665	68665	I	0	“ That ’s awfully nice of her . ”
68716	68724	68725	68725	I	0	“ She likes to cook for people , ”
68732	68749	68725	68725	I	0	“ And she lives alone , so she does n’t get to do it very often . ”
68750	68772	68691	68691	I	0	“ How old is Frannie now ? Last time I saw her , she was probably close to Millie ’s age . ”
68773	68778	68691	68691	I	0	“ Twenty - seven . ”
68779	68787	68725	68725	I	0	“ And you said she lives alone ? ”
68788	68791	68691	68691	I	0	“ Yes . ”
68800	68805	68691	68691	I	0	“ Is she attractive ? ”
68806	68809	68725	68725	I	0	“ Mom . ”
68810	68821	68822	68822	she	0	“ What ? I ’m just trying to picture her , ”
68833	68842	68826	68826	I	0	“ Yes . She ’s a pretty girl . ”
68843	68853	68691	68691	I	0	“ Is there something going on between you two ? ”
68854	68859	68691	68691	I	0	“ Jesus , Mom ! ”
68860	68900	68826	68826	I	0	“ I ’m only asking because I think you need to be very careful . The girls have been through so much and it could be confusing and hurtful for them to see you with another woman so soon . ”
68901	68905	68691	68691	I	0	“ I know . ”
68906	68981	68691	68691	I	0	“ I ’m not saying you have to be alone for the rest of your life , but they ’re just so young , and they ’ve still got to be traumatized about their mom running off with another man . Deep down they ’re probably afraid of losing you that way too . You want them to feel one hundred and ten percent certain they are the most important people in your life . ”
68982	68986	68987	68987	I	0	“ They do , ”
68990	69000	68987	68987	I	0	“ I do n’t need to be told this . ”
69001	69017	69018	69018	she	1045	“ And maybe it would be best not to take up with their beloved nanny , ”
69022	69045	69018	69018	she	1045	“ I mean , what happens if you two have a fight and she quits ? Then the girls lose her too . ”
69046	69058	68987	68987	I	0	“ And it would be my fault . I get it . ”
69059	69107	68987	68987	I	0	“ I ’m not blaming you for anything , darling . I know how hard this has been for you , and I feel awful we ’re not there more often to help you out . But the extreme cold is bad for Daddy ’s blood pressure . ”
69108	69119	69018	69018	she	1045	“ We ’re fine , Mom . I ’m managing . ”
69120	69178	68987	68987	I	0	“ Of course you are . You ’re a wonderful father , and I know you love those girls to pieces . But I also know you must be lonely too , and with a pretty young girl around so much , I can see how tempting it would be to … take advantage of the situation . ”
69179	69188	69243	69243	she	520	“ I ’m not taking advantage of anything ! ”
69192	69216	69217	69217	I	0	“ Okay , okay . I did n’t mean to upset you , I just want to make certain the kids are protected . ”
69263	69289	69256	69256	she	520	“ The kids are my number one priority , Mom . They always have been . And they ’ll stay that way no matter what . ”
69290	69304	69256	69256	she	520	“ Good . Well , I ’ll see you Thursday then , dear . ”
69305	69311	69312	69312	I	0	“ Have a safe trip . ”
69460	69463	69452	69452	I	0	“ Hello ? ”
69464	69469	69452	69452	I	0	“ Who ’s Frannie ? ”
69470	69473	69452	69452	I	0	“ What ? ”
69474	69493	69452	69452	I	0	“ Frannie . Millie texted me all weekend about Frannie this and Frannie that . Who is she ? ”
69510	69522	69503	69503	I	0	“ Frannie Sawyer . From Cloverleigh . She babysits for them . ”
69523	69529	69452	69452	I	0	“ Is she my replacement ? ”
69530	69542	69503	69503	I	0	“ I ’m hanging up , Carla . You ’re drunk . ”
69543	69549	69503	69503	I	0	“ Are you fucking her ? ”
69550	69558	69452	69452	I	0	“ That ’s none of your business . ”
69559	69591	69503	69503	I	0	“ The hell it is n’t . I ’m their mother . How dare you bring some little slut into the house ? How old is she , twenty - two ? ”
69592	69597	69598	69598	I	0	“ Twenty - seven , ”
69611	69642	69606	69606	She	1053	“ Well , I get why you ’re chasing her around , but what the hell does she want with you ? Does she think you have money or something ? ”
69647	69654	69606	69606	She	1053	“ She knows who I am . ”
69655	69684	69692	69692	I	0	“ Oh , so she ’s a mind reader ? Because you never told me who you were . And why does Millie think she ’s so great ? ”
69685	69691	69692	69692	I	0	“ Because she ’s here , ”
69696	69719	69692	69692	I	0	“ And she cares about them . She gives them love and attention , which is more than they get from you . ”
69720	69736	69606	69606	She	1053	“ I ’m their mother . They ’re supposed to love me no matter what . ”
69737	69741	69750	69750	she	0	“ You left . ”
69742	69749	69750	69750	she	0	“ Because you forced me to ! ”
69753	69780	69750	69750	she	0	“ If you would have been a better husband , I would n’t have felt so alone ! It ’s your fault I had to leave . ”
69781	69784	69606	69606	She	1053	“ Carla . ”
69785	69802	69750	69750	she	0	“ Just admit it — you did n’t want to marry me in the first place . ”
69803	69850	69750	69750	she	0	“ You ’re right . I did n’t want to get married that soon . We ’d only known each other for a few months . We were young . I was about to deploy for Iraq . But I did what I thought was right . ”
69851	69861	69862	69862	she	0	“ I never wanted to be your charity case ! ”
69865	69888	69750	69750	she	0	“ It was n’t like that , and you know it . I tried hard to be a good husband and father . ”
69889	69897	69606	69606	She	1053	“ You did n’t try hard enough . ”
69898	69919	69750	69750	she	0	“ You wanted too much from me , Carla . No matter what I did , it was never enough . ”
69920	69938	69750	69750	she	0	“ I only wanted you to pay attention to me . I wanted you to love me . ”
69939	69945	69946	69946	I	0	“ I did , Carla . ”
69951	69970	69946	69946	I	0	“ But you were always sulking and pouting . Punishing me for things I had no control over . ”
69971	69979	69750	69750	she	0	“ Like leaving us all the time ? ”
69980	69995	69750	69750	she	0	“ I had no choice about my deployments , Carla . You know that . ”
69996	70016	69946	69946	I	0	“ And when you got back , you were always so happy to see the kids but not me . ”
70017	70023	69750	69750	she	0	“ That is n’t true . ”
70024	70040	69750	69750	she	0	“ Well , that ’s what it felt like . You were cold and distant . ”
70041	70070	69750	69750	she	0	“ I needed time to readjust . Life at home was a shock to me . You never understood that . You never let me talk about it . ”
70071	70113	69946	69946	I	0	“ Because I wanted you to just forget it and be the husband I ’d dreamed about . The husband I deserved . I ’d waited and waited and waited for you , and then you came home and disappointed me . ”
70114	70119	70120	70120	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
70133	70147	70148	70148	she	1054	“ That ’s why I had to spend all that money on things , ”
70152	70172	70148	70148	she	1054	“ That ’s why I drank . I was trying to fill the void you left in my life . ”
70179	70187	70173	70173	I	0	“ I hope you ’re happier now . ”
70188	70192	70193	70193	she	1054	“ I am ! ”
70196	70215	70193	70193	she	1054	“ And since you ’re all doing so well without me , maybe I ’ll never come back . ”
70216	70229	70230	70230	She	1054	“ You do what you want , Carla . You always have . ”
70419	70422	70408	70408	I	0	“ Hello ? ”
70423	70429	70408	70408	I	0	“ Hey , guess what ? “
70432	70433	70434	70434	I	0	” “
70461	70462	70440	70440	She	204	” “
70467	70468	70440	70440	She	204	” “
70506	70507	70513	70513	Frannie	248	” “
70521	70526	70515	70515	I	0	” She giggled nervously . “
70543	70599	70529	70529	I	0	” Of course I wanted to . I wanted to do all kinds of things for her , and in a perfect world , I ’d be able to . But we did n’t have perfection — not even close . And this felt like something I could manage that did n’t look overly romantic . “
70646	70647	70638	70638	I	0	” “
70728	70736	70725	70725	her	121	” I smiled at her breathless enthusiasm . “
70751	70763	70749	70749	Charmin	132	” She laughed , and the sound made my chest tighten . “
70797	70798	70794	70794	I	0	” “
70801	70802	70794	70794	I	0	” “
70849	70853	70818	70818	her	463	” I grimaced . “
70864	70865	70818	70818	her	463	” “
70884	70889	70891	70891	I	0	” Her voice quieted . “
70898	70899	70900	70900	Me	0	” “
70903	71215	70900	70900	Me	0	” I said , and it was n’t a lie . I was glad I ’d gone after her . But the more time I spent with her , the more I wanted with her . And not just sneaking - around time , either — real time , where we did n’t have to hide or rush or worry about being caught . That was impossible without telling the kids , and it was too soon to do that . I supposed I could hire another babysitter and spend time with her apart from the kids , but that would take away from time with my girls , which would make me feel selfish and guilty , and it would give their mother even more ammunition . I could n’t win . Frannie On Tuesday I parked on the street about a block and a half down from Coffee Darling , and walked to the shop with butterflies in my belly , my boots crunching in the snow on the sidewalk . Mack had texted about half an hour ago that he was running late but he ’d be here as fast as he could . The shop had closed earlier in the day — at 2:00 P.M. , the hours on the window said — so the glass door was locked when I tried to pull it open at quarter to four . I peered inside , my pulse racing . The space was narrow and deep , with a counter and a few glass cases over to the left , and tables lining the wall on the right . I knocked on the glass and a few seconds later , I saw a woman come from what I assumed was the kitchen and hurry around the counter toward the door . She unlocked it and pushed it open . “
71221	71229	71216	71216	You	1065	” she said with a warm smile . “
71240	71241	71216	71216	You	1065	” “
71244	71288	71216	71216	You	1065	” I entered the shop and she locked the door behind me . She had medium - length dark hair pulled into a ponytail and was clearly pregnant , although she did n’t have that about - to - pop look about her . “
71291	71298	71299	71299	I	0	” She held out her hand . “
71305	71311	71301	71301	Natalie	123	” She shrugged , laughing . “
71317	71327	71301	71301	Natalie	123	” I laughed too as I shook her hand . “
71354	71358	71360	71360	you	1505	” Natalie beamed . “
71393	71394	71381	71381	we	1067	” “
71401	71405	71381	71381	we	1067	” She nodded . “
71455	71456	71442	71442	Maxima	121	” “
71469	71478	71459	71459	I	0	” I tucked my hair behind my ears . “
71485	71486	71479	71479	I	0	” “
71490	71491	71494	71494	he	1070	” “
71513	71514	71511	71511	Jillian	127	” “
71520	71521	71511	71511	Jillian	127	” “
71531	71532	71526	71526	he	1070	” “
71539	71540	71526	71526	he	1070	” “
71558	71562	71555	71556	Sylvia Sawyer	61	” She nodded . “
71577	71581	71549	71549	she	204	” I laughed . “
71584	71585	71549	71549	she	204	” “
71593	71602	71587	71587	I	0	” She smiled at me over her shoulder . “
71606	71690	71587	71587	I	0	” She showed me the kitchen , which was n’t huge but was clean , well - organized , and full of shiny new equipment . My eyes popped as I looked everything over — the marble and wood counters , the rolling racks of pots and pans , the mixers lined up like soldiers , the massive stainless appliances . It was n’t as big as the kitchen at the inn , but it was better suited to baking and seemed neater . “
71695	71707	71587	71587	I	0	” I said , running my hand along the cool marble . “
71716	71886	71887	71887	They	1074	” By the time she was done showing me the kitchen and tiny office , Maxima had arrived . She asked some questions as Natalie finished the tour out front . Mack still had n’t arrived , and I looked at my phone again . I ’d missed a call from him a few minutes ago and he ’d left a voicemail . Feeling like it would have been impolite to listen to it now , I tucked my phone back into my bag , hoped everything was okay , and crossed my fingers that he could still make it . I really wanted his opinion . But he never showed . Natalie poured us each a cup of coffee and she , Maxima , and I sat down at one of the tables along the wall . From my bag I pulled out a white box of macarons I ’d baked last night — pink - hued rosewater cream and violet - colored orange lavender . Natalie gasped . “
71891	71892	71887	71887	They	1074	” “
71900	71904	71887	71887	They	1074	” said Maxima . “

71913	71922	71923	71923	I	0	” I said , pride warming my insides . “
71929	71941	71923	71923	I	0	” She picked out a lavender macaron and took a bite . “
71946	71950	71923	71923	I	0	” she mumbled . “
71955	71959	71923	71923	I	0	” I smiled . “
71963	72009	72010	72010	I	0	” We sipped coffee and nibbled macarons as we went over the options . Natalie said she ’d sell the building if she found the right buyer , but she was emotionally invested in the place and would really prefer to take on a partner . “
72016	72028	72010	72010	I	0	” she said , her eyes welling as she looked around , “
72099	72110	72091	72091	I	0	” She grabbed a napkin and dabbed at her eyes . “
72121	72122	72091	72091	I	0	” “
72127	72132	72133	72133	I	0	” I said softly . “
72188	72194	72183	72183	My	0	” I took a breath . “
72221	72229	72214	72214	I	0	” Natalie put a hand over mine . “
72258	72267	72268	72268	You	0	” She gestured toward the empty macarons box . “
72286	72287	72273	72273	I	0	” “
72291	72306	72307	72307	I	0	” I glanced at the door , wishing I had Mack here for confidence . “

72377	72381	72382	72382	Bakeries	133	” Natalie asked . “

72403	72408	72395	72395	I	0	” I told her . “
72434	72439	72422	72422	I	0	” Then I paused . “
72461	72462	72422	72422	I	0	” “
72469	72473	72422	72422	I	0	” Maxima asked . “
72476	72477	72422	72422	I	0	” “
72485	72496	72422	72422	I	0	” Natalie said , placing her hands on her stomach . “
72508	72509	72422	72422	I	0	” “
72518	72522	72523	72524	A girl	1087	” asked Maxima . “
72526	72532	72523	72524	A girl	1087	” Natalie blushed and smiled . “
72566	72567	72568	72568	I	0	” “
72571	72575	72568	72568	I	0	” I said . “
72582	72583	72584	72585	Any kids	1090	” “
72587	72597	72584	72585	Any kids	1090	” she asked , glancing at my left hand . “
72603	72609	72584	72585	Any kids	1090	” I smiled and shrugged . “
72613	72614	72584	72585	Any kids	1090	” “
72636	72642	72584	72585	Any kids	1090	” Natalie looked at Maxima . “
72652	72786	72584	72585	Any kids	1090	” Maxima said that since it would n’t involve the sale or rent of the building , this was a little outside her area of expertise , but she had business experience and gave us her advice . She also said again that she ’d be glad to invest in me if I needed money to buy in . About an hour later , Natalie and I parted with an impulsive hug and a promise to meet again soon . Maxima had recommended forming an LLC for the partnership if we decided to go through with it , but I wanted to talk to Mack or my dad first . My head was spinning . On the walk to my car , I pulled out my phone and listened to Mack ’s message . “
72859	72988	72851	72851	I	0	” I reached my car and jumped in so I could start the heat . While the engine warmed up , I texted him back . Poor Felicity . I hope she ’s okay and please tell her I said to feel better . Everything went great here . I ca n’t wait to tell you about it . And I ’m not mad ! On the contrary , I was n’t sure anything could take away from my excitement . I was disappointed that he had n’t been able to make it , but I understood . Mostly I was just dying to tell someone about the meeting . I called Chloe on the way home and filled her in , and she was thrilled for me . “
72995	72999	72993	72993	Frannie	1505	” she said . “
73016	73070	73010	73010	I	0	” I called April too , but she did n’t answer . I left her a message as I was pulling into the garage at home , and went up to my apartment , unable to stop smiling . While I was unzipping my coat , my phone buzzed — it was Mack . “
73077	73078	73079	73079	She	38	” “
73122	73123	73124	73124	You	1094	” “
73128	73129	73124	73124	You	1094	” “

73300	73301	73302	73302	I	0	” “
73310	73327	73328	73328	I	0	” Glancing at my kitchen , I remembered the stuffed shells I had in the freezer . “
73340	73347	73328	73328	I	0	” I teased . He groaned . “
73378	73379	73370	73370	I	0	” “
73430	73436	73422	73422	I	0	” Exhaling , he said , “
73454	73455	73448	73448	I	0	” “
73466	73546	73460	73460	I	0	” Mack She came over that night with stuffed shells and told me all about the meeting while she reheated them . When dinner was done , she and Millie loaded the dishwasher , singing and giggling like friends while I got Winnie in the shower and tended to a miserable Felicity . When I came back down after getting Winnie in bed , Millie was in the shower and Frannie was putting on her coat in the kitchen . “
73555	73562	73547	73547	I	0	” she said , zipping up . “
73572	73590	73563	73563	I	0	” I took her in my arms for the first time that day and kissed her forehead . “
73605	73613	73596	73596	I	0	” Laughing , she squeezed my torso . “
73626	73627	73596	73596	I	0	” “
73665	73669	73670	73670	I	0	” She sighed . “

73782	73787	73775	73775	I	0	” I went on , “
73815	73821	73808	73808	she	1434	” She kissed my cheek . “
73831	73832	73833	73833	Dad	216	” “
73835	73866	73833	73833	Dad	216	” Frannie and I jumped apart so fast , her tailbone hit the island and she winced , rubbing it . Millie stood in the dining room blinking at us . “
73875	73883	73867	73867	I	0	” I said , my heart pounding . “
73889	73890	73867	73867	I	0	” “

73945	73952	73940	73940	Everybody	502	” Then she looked at Frannie . “
73967	73968	73971	73971	I	0	” “
73988	74008	73978	73979	your dad	216	” I groaned , turning Millie around by the shoulders and giving her a gentle shove toward the stairs . “
74028	74044	74020	74020	I	0	” When she was gone , Frannie and I exchanged a wide - eyed look . “
74051	74055	74048	74048	she	1434	” I asked . “
74059	74073	74048	74048	she	1434	” she said , but I could tell she did n’t mean it . “
74082	74211	74075	74075	we	1108	” I watched her leave , feeling that ache in my chest again , and I wished there was a way I could ’ve asked her to stay . I was tired of being careful , tired of missing her at night , tired of feeling bad for wanting her , tired of feeling like I was one person with her , and a different person with the kids . Neither version of me was complete . I wanted to be both at once . Was it impossible ? * * * On Wednesday , Mrs. Ingersoll said she ’d take care of feeding the kids if I needed more time at work , so I was still in my office at seven when I heard a knock . “
74215	74227	74075	74075	we	1108	” The door swung open , and Frannie peeked around it . “
74230	74231	74075	74075	we	1108	” “
74234	74246	74075	74075	we	1108	” I closed my laptop , glad to see her face . “
74252	74253	74075	74075	we	1108	” “
74266	74267	74256	74256	I	0	” “
74280	74295	74296	74296	I	0	” I gestured at one of the two chairs in front of my desk . “
74304	74319	74320	74320	You	0	” She shut the door and leaned back against it , her expression wary . “
74344	74345	74334	74334	I	0	” “
74352	74353	74346	74346	I	0	” “
74399	74400	74401	74401	He	216	” “
74408	74416	74401	74401	He	216	” She nodded , her smile radiant . “
74453	74454	74455	74455	Frannie	1505	” “
74461	74487	74455	74455	Frannie	1505	” Her eyes were bright and her skin was flushed with happiness . She looked beautiful and sexy and I was dying to touch her . “
74507	74519	74496	74496	I	0	” She pushed off the door and bounced around a little . “
74532	74540	74543	74543	you	1505	” She waved a hand at me . “
74554	74555	74550	74550	I	0	” “
74567	74578	74550	74550	I	0	” I stared hard at her , my face stony . “
74583	74596	74550	74550	I	0	” She did as I asked , a smile on her face . “
74605	74606	74550	74550	I	0	” “
74616	74617	74550	74550	I	0	” “
74622	74646	74550	74550	I	0	” she questioned coyly , one eyebrow arched . I ’m going to hell , I thought . But I said it anyway . “
74661	74771	74550	74550	I	0	” Her jaw fell open , and for a fraction of a second , I thought I ’d gone too far . And then the little vixen dropped to the floor and fucking crawled to me , her back arched , her eyes hooded , her hair dangling seductively . I turned my chair to face her as she slinked slowly around my desk . When she reached my feet , she put her hands on my knees . I unbuckled my belt and she watched as I took my cock in my hand , working it slowly up and down the thickening shaft . Her eyes were wide . “
74776	74928	74550	74550	I	0	” I asked . She shook her head . She licked her lips . She slid her hands up my thighs and took my dick from my grasp , wrapping her fingers around it . Then she lowered her head over my lap and teased me with her tongue , slow swirling strokes over the crown that made my stomach muscles tighten and my legs tense . With my other hand , I reach for her hair , lifting it off her face . My breath caught as I watched her head dip lower to leisurely lick her way from the bottom to the top , where she circled the sensitive tip . Three fucking times she tortured me that way , and on the third time , her eyes met mine . She kept looking at me while she took only the head between her wet lips and sucked gently . “
74931	75008	74550	74550	I	0	” I growled . Lowering her eyes and her mouth , she took me in a little deeper and moaned . It felt so good I nearly lost my patience and found my hand fisting in her hair . I must have pulled a little too hard because she gasped and took her mouth off me . I loosened my grip and frowned . There was a reason this activity had been verboten during my marriage . “
75011	75012	74550	74550	I	0	” “
75017	75034	74550	74550	I	0	” she panted , looking up at me again , that wicked spark in her eye . “
75050	75068	75046	75046	I	0	” My dick throbbed in her hand , and I tightened my fist again in her hair . “
75073	75463	75046	75046	I	0	” She made a noise somewhere between a laugh and a moan , and put her mouth on me again . This time , she took me all the way to the back of her throat , and I watched in ecstatic disbelief as her lips and tongue moved up and down my cock . But it was n’t long before watching was n’t enough — the restless , fiery tension building up in my body demanded I move . With my hands on her head , I leaned back and began to thrust up — quick , hard jabs that forced her to take me in deeper . She gasped and grunted and struggled to breathe , but she never pushed me away . Her hands moved to my hips and she dug her fingers into my flesh as I fucked her hot little mouth faster and faster , my blood running hotter and hotter until suddenly the orgasm erupted within me and I poured into her without even giving a warning . A nicer guy probably would have pulled out instead of pulling her closer , but at that moment I was content to be the biggest asshole on the planet as long as I got to come with my cock hitting the back of her throat . It was selfish as fuck , but it was pure ecstasy . Not only the orgasm , but the awareness that she wanted all of me . Accepted all of me . Even craved all of me . I forgot where we were , what day it was , what I was supposed to be doing — it ’s possible I even forgot my own fucking name . When I finally let go of her head and she sat back onto her heels , looking up at me like she ’d just won a million fucking dollars , my head was spinning , my heart was throbbing , and I could hardly breathe . It was like nothing I ’d ever felt before . I looked at her on the floor at my feet and thought , Either I ’m about to die and that was life ’s final parting gift , or I ’m in love with her . I was n’t sure which one was worse . Frannie “
75466	75474	75046	75046	I	0	” he whispered , looking almost frightened . “
75481	75517	75046	75046	I	0	” I smiled and wiped my lower lip with the back of one wrist . Suddenly he reached down , grabbed me beneath the arms and hoisted me onto the desk in front of him . “
75522	75523	75519	75519	you	1115	” “
75541	75549	75532	75532	I	0	” His jaw dropped for a second . “
75560	75570	75550	75550	You	1115	” I shrugged , giving him a shy smile . “
75616	75617	75618	75618	I	0	” “
75628	75640	75618	75618	I	0	” he said , reaching for the button on my pants . “
75660	75661	75662	75662	Mack	1505	” “
75676	75709	75666	75666	You	1505	” I tried to push his hands away , but instead he succeeded in tipping me backward by the shoulders so I was on my back , legs dangling off the desk . “
75713	75744	75666	75666	You	1505	” He removed my shoes , and grabbed my pants , yanking them all the way off , along with my underwear . I propped myself up on my elbows . “
75758	75759	75752	75753	Mrs. Ingersoll	463	” “
75764	75778	75761	75762	Mrs. Ingersoll	463	” He dropped to his knees and threw my legs over his shoulders . “
75787	75840	75841	75841	I	0	” And then I could n’t talk anymore , because his tongue was doing things that took away my ability to form coherent thoughts . After a few long , slow strokes up my center and several seconds of soft , swirling circles over my clit , he picked up his head . “
75925	75926	75923	75923	you	204	” “
75931	75944	75923	75923	you	204	” I said , my body already wet and aching for him . “
75960	75985	75986	75986	You	204	” He returned to what he ’d been doing before , but this time , he slid one long finger inside me as well . “
75989	76008	75986	75986	You	204	” I asked weakly , my eyes popping at the sight of his dark hair between my thighs . “
76011	76033	76034	76034	I	0	” He looked up and pushed two fingers in this time , his breath hot and quick on my tingling skin . “
76043	76093	76099	76099	she	204	” * * * After checking that the coast was clear , he walked me up to my apartment — the back way , so we did n’t have to go through the lobby . My mother was still at the desk , and he wanted to avoid her . “
76105	76114	76099	76099	she	204	” I said as we climbed the stairs . “
76128	76129	76115	76115	She	204	” “
76135	76136	76137	76137	I	0	” “
76169	76178	76163	76163	She	204	” He tucked his hands in his pockets . “
76186	76194	76195	76195	You	204	” I stopped halfway up the staircase . “
76199	76200	76211	76211	she	204	” “
76245	76256	76260	76260	she	204	” Moving slowly , I resumed going up the steps . “
76263	76264	76260	76260	she	204	” “
76275	76276	76260	76260	she	204	” “
76280	76289	76260	76260	she	204	” He shrugged as we reached the landing . “
76298	76338	76260	76260	she	204	” I felt like there was a lot more he was n’t saying , but I did n’t want to push . From the look on his face , it was clear he was n’t happy about the conversation . “
76349	76354	76341	76341	I	0	” Then I winced . “
76374	76379	76365	76365	Millie	37	” His frown deepened . “
76382	76383	76365	76365	Millie	37	” “
76397	76398	76392	76392	We	1122	” “
76439	76440	76441	76441	Moms	689	” “
76456	76457	76447	76447	They	689	” “
76465	76471	76447	76447	They	689	” He shook his head . “
76494	76507	76481	76481	You	1125	” He looked so upset , I grabbed him in a hug . “
76532	76533	76534	76535	My ex	1684	” “
76541	76545	76546	76546	She	1684	” I stiffened . “
76549	76550	76546	76546	She	1684	” “
76559	76560	76561	76561	You	1125	” “
76565	76580	76561	76561	You	1125	” Surprised , I released him and stepped back . He shook his head . “
76603	76604	76597	76597	I	0	” “
76609	76638	76605	76605	You	1125	” I was n’t sure whether to be happy or not . It seemed like a step in the right direction , but he looked upset about it . “
76652	76665	76647	76647	I	0	” He rubbed his face with both hands . I swallowed hard . “
76673	76674	76670	76670	she	1684	” “
76733	76734	76737	76737	Mack	1505	” “
76739	76759	76760	76760	I	0	” I twisted my fingers together at my waist . Clearly this had been weighing on him for days . “
76771	76775	76767	76767	you	1505	” He shrugged . “
76839	76860	76837	76837	she	1129	” I could see him getting more and more worked up , and I put my arms around him again . “
76867	76868	76837	76837	she	1129	” “
76895	76896	76897	76897	I	0	” “
76911	76953	76905	76905	You	1505	” His arms came around me , warm and tight and strong , which was reassuring . But he said nothing , which was not . * * * On Thursday , April came by the desk during my morning shift . “
76976	76977	76905	76905	You	1505	” “
76983	76984	76980	76980	Your	1505	” “
76989	76993	76994	76994	I	0	” I nodded . “
77000	77154	76994	76994	I	0	” My shift ended at five , and I ran upstairs to change out of my work clothes and grab a bite to eat . At six , I went down to the bar , where April , Stella , and her sister Emme were sitting at a rectangular high - top table . Stella and Emme both had glasses of sparkling wine , and their faces were glowing after their day at the spa . We went over the details and timing from the rehearsal dinner all the way through the late - night pizza buffet at the reception . Stella was an easygoing bride , and between Emme and April , the plans were so well organized that it seemed impossible anything could go wrong . At quarter to seven , they went up to change for their girls ’ night out , and April and I lingered at the table . “
77165	77170	77157	77157	we	1134	” my sister said . “
77177	77181	77182	77182	I	0	” I nodded . “
77187	77211	77182	77182	I	0	” We moved to the bar so we were n’t taking up a table for four and ordered two glasses of pinot noir . “
77217	77224	77225	77225	I	0	” she asked with a smile . “
77248	77249	77225	77225	I	0	” “
77258	77268	77269	77269	Dad	216	” I filled her in on all the details . “

77548	77563	77545	77545	they	227	” I had to laugh a little , remembering the looks on their faces . “

78030	78038	78041	78042	little sister	1151	” Her lips curved into a smile . “
78049	78321	78044	78044	You	1151	” Mack My folks arrived on Thursday , and that night I met up with Woods at Hop Lot Brewing Co. , one of our old favorite places for food and drinks after work . I was looking forward to it , not just because I had n’t seen Woods in a long time and he was like a brother to me , but because I ’d had this fucking knot in the pit of my stomach all day long , growing tighter and tighter every time I thought about Frannie . I ’d lain awake all night long hearing her voice in my head . I ’m not going anywhere . You know that , right ? And then I ’d picture her the way she ’d looked kneeling at my feet , so sweet and sexy and happy , and my heart felt like it was going to explode . It was too much . Things had moved too fast , and my feelings for her were running too deep . She was all I wanted , and I wanted her all the time . How had I let this happen ? Sitting at the bar , Woods and I caught up over local IPAs , wings , burgers , and fries . He told me how things were going for him downstate , about his job as groundskeeper for a country club , and the work he was doing on their house . He also grumbled a fair amount about the cost and planning of the wedding and said he ’d be glad when it was all over . “

79102	79108	79109	79109	You	1158	” Woods burst out laughing . “

79687	79715	79679	79679	I	0	” Woods gave me a look that called bullshit , but he did n’t say anything . He just picked up his beer and took another drink . “

79791	79796	79797	79797	I	0	” My gut twisted . “
79810	79821	79822	79822	You	1176	” Woods was silent a moment . Then he said , “
79877	79885	79864	79875	one asshole in our life who says what needs to be said	1184	” I gave him the side eye . “
79888	79889	79864	79875	one asshole in our life who says what needs to be said	1184	” “
79908	79914	79905	79905	you	1176	” I sat up taller . “
79926	79933	79918	79918	I	0	” He held up his hands . “

79991	80002	80003	80003	I	0	” I said , the knot in my stomach thickening . “
80010	80074	80003	80003	I	0	” * * * The moment I saw her at the rehearsal the next day , my heart seized and my breath stopped and my legs did n’t want to move . I was standing at the back of the wedding barn , where the ceremony was going to take place , and she came over with a big smile on her face . “
80079	80083	80077	80077	you	1176	” she said . “
80093	80094	80086	80086	your	1176	” “
80099	80109	80086	80086	your	1176	” I could hardly look her in the eye . “
80115	80116	80112	80112	you	1176	” “
80126	80127	80128	80130	No strip clubs	1189	” “
80132	80136	80128	80130	No strip clubs	1189	” she teased . “
80147	80154	80128	80130	No strip clubs	1189	” I could n’t even smile . “
80157	80158	80128	80130	No strip clubs	1189	” “
80165	80166	80160	80160	you	1176	” “
80171	80175	80160	80160	you	1176	” I hesitated . “
80189	80214	80182	80182	I	0	” God , this was torture . I did n’t know where to look , so I stared at the ground between our feet . “
80226	80231	80182	80182	I	0	” she asked hopefully . “
80239	80285	80182	80182	I	0	” Fuck . What the hell was I going to do about that ? How could I stay with her knowing what I was going to do ? I already felt like the biggest jerk on the planet . That would just make it worse . “
80292	80304	80290	80290	Mack	1505	” She sounded confused , and I did n’t blame her . “
80316	80329	80311	80311	you	1176	” It was bullshit . The rehearsal had n’t even started yet . “
80348	80448	80449	80449	You	1176	” I nodded , feeling like fucking dirt , and she gave me one last smile before walking away , but it was n’t a happy smile . It was nervous and tentative , and I hated myself for it . But that was nothing compared to the following night . Mack Three pairs of eyes watched me knot the deep burgundy tie around my neck . My hair was trimmed , my shave was close , my navy suit fit perfectly . On the outside , everything was perfect . On the inside , I was a mess . “
80455	80482	80453	80453	Daddy	36	” said Felicity . All three girls were lying across my bed on their bellies , studying me as I finished getting ready for the wedding . “
80485	80502	80503	80503	I	0	” But my tie was crooked . Frowning , I loosened the knot and tried again . “
80512	80516	80517	80517	Adults	1192	” said Millie . “
80520	80525	80517	80517	Adults	1192	” I told her . “
80546	80551	80539	80539	she	204	” She sighed dramatically . “
80560	80568	80539	80539	she	204	” My mother appeared in the doorway . “
80578	80591	80574	80574	you	0	” she said , leaning on the frame with her arms folded . “
80595	80604	80605	80605	I	0	” I dropped my arms to my side . “
80611	80620	80607	80607	I	0	” But I did n’t want to leave . “
80627	80631	80607	80607	I	0	” she asked . “
80643	80675	80607	80607	I	0	” I recited the bare bones plan that Woods had given to me . By contrast , the women all had three - page , color - coded itineraries for today . “
80680	80685	80607	80607	I	0	” my mother said . “
80704	80724	80697	80697	you	0	” I frowned at my reflection and tugged at the knot again . My collar was a little tight . “
80733	80734	80727	80727	I	0	” “
80739	80757	80727	80727	I	0	” She came into the room and turned me to face her , fussing with my tie . “
80797	80817	80831	80831	Daddy	36	” The girls giggled , and I gave them the stink eye before pushing my mother ’s hands away . “
80827	80828	80831	80831	Daddy	36	” “
80833	80854	80831	80831	Daddy	36	” All three hopped off the bed and accosted me for hugs as I tried to get out the door . “
80858	80985	80986	80987	Everybody decent	1197	” I hugged and kissed them , gave my mother a peck on the cheek , waved at my dad , who was on the couch watching football , and hustled out the back door . On the drive to Cloverleigh , which was shitty because of the snow , I made up my mind that I was not going to spend the night with Frannie . It was too selfish . I ’d make up some excuse why I had to go home , and then tomorrow , maybe we could talk . And then I saw her . Around quarter to four , she poked her head into the room the groomsmen were using at the inn to wait for the ceremony to begin . “
80989	80990	80986	80987	Everybody decent	1197	” “
80995	81086	80986	80987	Everybody decent	1197	” Woods called . Frannie entered the room , and my knees almost buckled . She wore a black velvet dress that clung to her curves for dear life . It had short sleeves , a deep V neck , and hit her right at the knees . She wore spiky black high heels with an ankle strap and her gold - threaded hair was loose and wavy , flowing over one shoulder . I had to stop myself from rushing over to her and burying my face in it . “
81091	81103	80986	80987	Everybody decent	1197	” she said , smiling at us with deep red lips . “
81120	81121	81104	81104	I	0	” “
81124	81132	81104	81104	I	0	” Woods looked excited to take action . “
81137	81147	81104	81104	I	0	” he asked me . I patted my pocket . “
81152	81179	81180	81180	You	1198	” On the walk over to the barn , we had to go outside , and I hung back to fall in step next to Frannie . “
81184	81189	81180	81180	You	1198	” I told her . “
81200	81215	81197	81197	my	0	” I slipped out of my suit coat and draped it over her shoulders . “
81218	81227	81228	81228	You	1198	” she said , smiling shyly at me . “
81234	81235	81228	81228	You	1198	” “
81240	81244	81238	81238	you	1198	” I asked . “
81247	81266	81267	81267	He	1198	” She looked up ahead at Woods , who was practically running toward the barn , and laughed . “
81272	81273	81267	81267	He	1198	” “
81276	81277	81278	81278	I	0	” “
81290	81295	81278	81278	I	0	” Then she sighed . “
81302	81303	81278	81278	I	0	” “
81311	81312	81278	81278	I	0	” “
81351	81399	81400	81400	I	0	” She gave me a hopeful smile . I frowned and pulled the door to the barn open for her , torn between what I wanted to do and what I should do . But either way , this was n’t the time to deal with that . “
81404	81416	81400	81400	I	0	” Her smile widened , and her eyes danced with light . “
81441	81768	81431	81431	April	52	” I watched her walk away and felt like shit . I stood by my best friend as he married the love of his life and felt like shit . I watched them speak their vows , slide rings on each other ’s fingers , share their first kiss as husband and wife — and every moment made me feel worse . Because I knew that Frannie was watching too , and I saw her wide - eyed with wonder , tearful with emotion , smiling with joy . She was probably dreaming of the day she walked down the aisle on her father ’s arm , radiant with happiness just like Stella was , her future husband waiting to take her hand , to begin a new life , to start a family . I could never give her that . I could never give her anything . I could n’t even kiss her in front of the kids . As the evening unfolded , I grew more and more ill at ease . I forced a smile in pictures . I barely touched my dinner . I watched stiffly from my place at the head table as the bride and groom danced for the first time , nursing a second glass of scotch . Frannie was sitting with her family , and I saw her looking at me from across the room throughout the meal , but I never made eye contact . It was killing me to know that I had to break her heart . And I did n’t want to do it tonight , but I was n’t sure I could take any more of this . I ’d never been someone who put off doing what needed to be done . Why prolong this torture ? After cake was served and the dancing began , she wandered over to where I sat with a glass of champagne in her hand . “
81771	81779	81431	81431	April	52	” she said , offering a smile . “
81782	81783	81431	81431	April	52	” “
81791	81811	81812	81812	I	0	” She gestured at my dessert plate , which was still full . I had n’t taken a bite . “
81818	81823	81812	81812	I	0	” Her eyebrows lifted . “
81838	81839	81834	81834	you	1203	” “
81845	81854	81834	81834	you	1203	” I loosened the knot in my tie . “
81861	81862	81855	81855	I	0	” “
81888	81889	81855	81855	I	0	” “
81899	81909	81855	81855	I	0	” She set her champagne down on the table . “
81919	81920	81924	81924	mine	0	” “
81926	81948	81924	81924	mine	0	” I shrugged it from my shoulders and she turned around to slip her arms into the too - long sleeves . “
81951	81959	81924	81924	mine	0	” She wrapped her arms around herself . “
81968	81974	81924	81924	mine	0	” She sniffed the collar . “
81980	82051	81924	81924	mine	0	” The queasy feeling in my gut intensified as we walked to the back of the barn and snuck out through the doors leading to the covered patio . In the summertime , wedding guests would have been out here as well , but since it was February , we had it to ourselves . Frannie breathed in and exhaled , creating a little white cloud in the icy dark . “
82060	82061	81924	81924	mine	0	” “
82064	82088	82089	82089	You	1205	” Sticking my hands in my pockets , I took a few deep breaths too , hoping they ’d calm my fraying nerves . “
82106	82112	82098	82098	I	0	” She elbowed me gently . “
82123	82130	82113	82113	I	0	” She turned to face me . “

82138	82153	82154	82154	I	0	” I forced myself to say words I did n’t feel in my heart . “
82164	82171	82154	82154	I	0	” She shook her head slightly . “
82180	82181	82182	82182	I	0	” “
82195	82196	82182	82182	I	0	” “
82200	82204	82182	82182	I	0	” I shrugged . “
82208	82209	82182	82182	I	0	” “
82232	82233	82225	82225	I	0	” “
82269	82284	82285	82285	I	0	” Again , she shook her head , and tears glistened in her eyes . “
82298	82299	82293	82293	I	0	” “
82348	82349	82338	82338	I	0	” “
82353	82364	82351	82351	Mack	1505	” she said , a tear dripping down her cheek . “
82379	82390	82372	82372	I	0	” I felt it like a sledgehammer to the chest . “
82403	82404	82372	82372	I	0	” “
82410	82414	82415	82415	I	0	” she wept . “
82429	82430	82415	82415	I	0	” “
82450	82451	82452	82452	I	0	” “
82460	82522	82452	82452	I	0	” she said , going to wipe her eyes but struggling to get her hand free from the long arms of my coat . Finally she gave up and the tears fell freely while I stood there helpless and angry . The thought of her with someone else made me want to put my fist through the barn ’s glass door . “
82534	82539	82523	82523	You	1505	” I told her . “
82561	82562	82547	82547	Frannie	1505	” “
82565	82569	82547	82547	Frannie	1505	” she sobbed . “
82580	82581	82547	82547	Frannie	1505	” “
82585	82586	82547	82547	Frannie	1505	” “
82596	82602	82603	82603	I	0	” I shook my head . “
82618	82619	82611	82611	I	0	” “
82628	82647	82620	82620	I	0	” she said , finally fishing a hand from my sleeve and dragging her wrist below her nose . “
82712	82713	82714	82714	You	1505	” “
82720	82721	82714	82714	You	1505	” “
82724	82725	82714	82714	You	1505	” “
82734	82750	82714	82714	You	1505	” She took a step closer to me and looked me right in the eye . “
82778	82782	82774	82774	You	1505	” I bristled . “
82829	82830	82824	82824	They	158	” “
82839	82855	82824	82824	They	158	” she said , sliding my coat from her arms and shoving it at me . “
82861	82862	82863	82863	Frannie	1505	” “
82878	83349	82868	82868	I	0	” But she spun on her heel , yanked open the door , and disappeared inside the barn . Hanging my head , I stood there for a moment with my coat in my hands and told myself I ’d done the right thing — for my kids , for Frannie , for myself . But I ’d never felt worse . * * * Somehow I made it through most of the reception , but just after nine I told Woods that I had to get going . I made up a story about one of the kids not feeling well , but I think he knew it was bullshit . He did n’t say anything , though , just gave me a hug and said he ’d give me a call once he and Stella were back from their honeymoon . I congratulated them both , kissed Stella on the cheek , and left . I knew what Frannie meant when she ’d said she envied them . I did too . My coat was in my office back at the inn , so I walked across the path and went to retrieve it . While I was there , I dropped into my chair and sat there for a moment , feeling dejected and empty . It did n’t seem possible that just a few days before , I ’d had Frannie right here on this desk , not a care in the world beyond making her feel amazing . And now look what I ’d done . I should have known better . Squeezing my eyes shut against the image of her and everything good she brought to my life , I jumped up from my chair , threw my coat over my arm , and took off . At home , I undressed in the bathroom and crawled into Millie ’s bottom bunk , where I ’d been sleeping since my parents arrived . But there was no way I could sleep tonight . Every time I closed my eyes , I saw those tears running down her cheeks in the dark . I heard her voice telling me she loved me . I felt the unbearable burden of knowing that I ’d broken her heart . I hoped she ’d forgive me someday . Frannie I kept my head down as I hurried through the barn , which hummed with the happy noise of a wedding reception — the band playing up front , the clink of silverware on glasses , the laughter and chatter of the guests . With tears continuing to fall , I blindly made my way to the back of the room and hunted for April . Spotting her over by the cake table , I headed in that direction . “
83352	83360	82868	82868	I	0	” I said , tapping her shoulder . “
83363	83369	82868	82868	I	0	” She turned and gasped . “
83374	83375	83376	83376	I	0	” “
83392	83393	83382	83382	you	0	” “
83401	83418	83419	83419	Mack	1505	” I shook my head and tried to choke back the sobs that threatened to erupt . “
83424	83428	83419	83419	Mack	1505	” Another gasp . “
83431	83432	83433	83433	He	1505	” “
83453	83454	83441	83441	I	0	” “
83460	83467	83457	83457	I	0	” She gave me a hug . “
83479	83480	83473	83473	I	0	” “
83495	83496	83489	83489	Dad	216	” “
83514	83672	83506	83506	I	0	” I could n’t even talk anymore , so I just nodded and walked away , my chest aching and my throat tight . After grabbing my coat from the back office , I stuck my hands in my pockets and walked along the pathway from the barn to the inn , crying openly . When I ’d gotten dressed tonight , I ’d been so excited . So hopeful . So happy . How had everything gone so wrong so fast ? * * * The next morning , I woke up to the sound of knocking on my apartment door . I reached for my phone to check the time . To my surprise , it was after ten already . I never slept this late , but then again , I ’d barely slept at all . Dragging myself out of bed , I wrapped my bathrobe around me and stumbled for the door . “
83675	83694	83697	83697	sweetie	73	” I croaked before opening it . My voice was hoarse from crying and my eyes still stung . “
83702	83727	83699	83699	You	73	” The voice was Chloe ’s . I opened the door and saw her standing there with two cardboard coffee cups in her hands . “
83739	83740	83731	83731	April	52	” “
83775	83776	83767	83767	I	0	” “
83783	83784	83767	83767	I	0	” “
83789	83798	83785	83785	You	73	” she said , kicking the door shut . “
83803	83830	83799	83799	I	0	” I assured her , heading for the couch . I flopped onto it and curled into a ball , wrapping my furry blanket around me . “
83840	83854	83858	83858	you	73	” She sat next to me and set one cup on the table . “
83860	83861	83858	83858	you	73	” “
83868	83877	83878	83878	He	73	” I set my chin on my knees . “
83884	83885	83878	83878	He	73	” “
83919	83920	83914	83915	The guy	1216	” “
83924	83935	83936	83936	He	1216	” I said , feeling my throat get tight again . “
83968	83969	83959	83959	he	1216	” “
83976	83984	83959	83959	he	1216	” Chloe frowned and shook her head . “
84036	84037	84038	84038	I	0	” “
84047	84054	84055	84055	He	1216	” I took a shuddery breath . “
84065	84066	84055	84055	He	1216	” “
84073	84074	84055	84055	He	1216	” “
84105	84106	84090	84090	he	1216	” “
84113	84114	84115	84115	I	0	” “
84123	84127	84120	84120	I	0	” I sniffled . “
84171	84172	84164	84164	he	1216	” “
84189	84197	84198	84198	I	0	” Chloe sipped her coffee and shrugged . “
84230	84231	84198	84198	I	0	” “
84239	84252	84233	84233	we	1221	” I snapped , annoyed that my sister would see his side . “
84279	84285	84286	84286	I	0	” I struggled with it . “
84310	84311	84305	84305	you	1224	” “
84383	84384	84376	84376	he	1216	” “
84396	84419	84376	84376	he	1216	” Dissolving into tears again , I tipped sideways in my faux fur cocoon and put my head in Chloe ’s lap . “
84427	84603	84376	84376	he	1216	” She stroked my hair and let me cry , but she did n’t tell me I was wrong . Mack Monday morning , I used the back door to the inn so I did n’t have to walk by the desk . By that afternoon , I was coming out of my skin , so I thought up an excuse to wander out to reception . Frannie ’s mother was at the desk alone , and I asked her something inconsequential before ducking back down the hall to my office . The day went on , and I never saw her . I started to get concerned . A few times I pulled out my phone and thought about texting or calling her , just to make sure she was okay , but I could n’t bring myself to do it . But she was n’t there Tuesday , either , and I could n’t take it anymore . Around ten , I wandered up to the desk and asked Daphne where she was . “
84652	84657	84658	84658	I	0	” Then she sighed . “
84683	84690	84691	84691	I	0	” She threw up her hands . “
84702	84703	84705	84705	she	1227	” “
84714	84720	84705	84705	she	1227	” Daphne shook her head . “
84781	84782	84779	84779	you	1232	” “
84793	85008	84787	84787	I	0	” I wished her luck and went back to my office , where I sank into my chair and stared blankly at my laptop . So I would n’t see her here anymore . I frowned . Had she quit early because of me ? Was she going to quit watching the girls too ? Would she even contact me to let me know ? I went home anxious and frustrated and angry with myself . Of course , I took it out on the kids , snapping at them about homework , barking about chores , and insisting that they eat what I put on the plate in front of them without complaint or I was going to lose my fucking mind . I made Winnie cry , I sent Millie to her room , and I ignored Felicity when she asked me why I was acting like a grumpy old man . I also put a lot of money in the swear jar . The next day , I apologized and tried to make it up to them by taking them out for tacos after therapy . When we got home , I went into my room and called Frannie . She did n’t answer , and I left her a message . “
85035	85075	85076	85076	I	0	” Then I paused , battling the urge to say more , to say I missed her , to say I was sorry , to say I loved her too , but it was too fucking much to handle . “
85082	85239	85076	85076	I	0	” I hung up and threw my phone down on the bed , fisting my hands in my hair . Of course she is n’t okay , you fuckwit . Are you okay ? I was n’t . Especially not when her text came about an hour later , which said , I will be there . That ’s it . Four words . I typed a reply , deleted it , typed another , and deleted that too . Just leave her alone , MacAllister . It ’s what she wants . You can give her that much . * * * On Thursday , I drove home from work with white knuckles . I ’d never been so nervous to walk into my own house . Frannie was at the counter with Felicity , and they both looked up when I entered the kitchen . Neither of them looked particularly happy to see me . “
85242	85250	85076	85076	I	0	” I said , testing my voice . “
85262	85263	85255	85255	We	1236	” “
85266	85273	85274	85274	Millie	37	” Frannie slid off her chair . “
85288	85289	85281	85281	Winnie	461	” “
85292	85301	85304	85304	Felicity	38	” I stuck my hands in my pockets . “
85310	85328	85304	85304	Felicity	38	” Eyes averted , Frannie moved past me into the back hall , and I followed her . “
85338	85342	85304	85304	Felicity	38	” I asked . “
85345	85357	85304	85304	Felicity	38	” She tugged on her boots and put on her coat . “
85363	85364	85304	85304	Felicity	38	” “
85367	85383	85304	85304	Felicity	38	” She freed her hair from the back of her coat and zipped it up . “
85388	85389	85390	85390	Frannie	1505	” “
85394	85409	85410	85410	I	0	” She froze with her back to me , one hand on the door . “
85414	85419	85420	85420	Me	0	” I said quietly . “
85439	85444	85445	85445	They	158	” I swallowed hard . “
85450	85451	85445	85445	They	158	” “
85458	85459	85445	85445	They	158	” “
85475	85476	85445	85445	They	158	” “
85483	85490	85491	85491	I	0	” She glanced back at me . “
85496	85501	85491	85491	I	0	” I nodded slowly . “
85522	85523	85511	85511	I	0	” “
85527	85531	85511	85511	I	0	” She paused . “
85558	85570	85571	85571	I	0	” She was still putting them first . It gutted me . “
85585	85630	85631	85631	He	1242	” She left without saying goodbye . That evening was a repeat performance of Tuesday , except I made Millie cry , I sent Felicity to her room , and Winnie did n’t even want me to kiss Ned the Hammerhead from Shedd goodnight . “
85640	85650	85631	85631	He	1242	” she told me , hugging the animal protectively . “
85657	85668	85669	85669	I	0	” I brushed her damp hair back from her head . “
85675	85676	85669	85669	I	0	” “
85683	85687	85688	85688	Frannie	1505	” she asked . “
85698	85706	85688	85688	Frannie	1505	” I nodded , my throat aching . “
85714	86095	85709	85709	I	0	” She sat up and wrapped her arms around my neck . I held her little body close to mine , breathing in her baby shampoo scent and choking back tears . I just wanted to do right by her , by all of them . But how were you supposed to know for sure what the right thing was ? What felt right to me was n’t necessarily what was best for them . Why did everything have to be so complicated ? * * * Friday afternoon , I was sitting at my desk , my laptop open in front of me , but my eyes were n’t on the screen . I was staring at the photo on my desk that Frannie had taken last summer at the Cloverleigh picnic . Winifred was on my shoulders , her tiny hands in mine , and the other two monkeys were hanging off my upper arms , their feet dangling . I remembered that day so vividly because it was the first day since Carla had left that all three kids seemed entirely happy — no tears , no asking for her , no whining of any kind . For the first time , I saw the possibility that we could be okay . There were still good times to be had . That day , most of the good times were because of Frannie . She ’d thought ahead and had plenty of activities she knew the kids would get excited about — games and crafts and time with the animals . She ’d occupied them almost the entire picnic , which had afforded me the opportunity to relax with co - workers and friends . Actually , Cloverleigh had always felt more like a family to me , and Frannie had been a part of that . Now she was gone , and I missed her terribly . It would get even worse when I hired a new nanny to replace her . I would n’t see her at work , I would n’t see her at home . The void in my life gnawed at me , a huge , gaping hole — and I ’d dug it . I dropped my forehead onto my fingertips . “
86099	86117	86122	86122	John	384	” a deep voice asked . I looked up and saw John Sawyer in my office doorway . “
86128	86140	86122	86122	John	384	” He ambled into my office , hitching up his jeans . “
86156	86157	86149	86149	you	384	” “
86166	86180	86149	86149	you	384	” I shut my laptop and gestured to the chairs across from me . “
86185	86196	86197	86197	I	0	” He lowered himself into one of them and exhaled . “
86224	86225	86204	86205	My wife	1244	” “
86231	86232	86233	86233	She	1244	” “
86269	86283	86284	86284	She	1244	” He shook his head , ran a hand through his silvery hair . “
86310	86314	86296	86296	They	1246	” I laughed . “
86322	86323	86315	86315	I	0	” “
86332	86336	86328	86328	You	1247	” he grumbled . “
86397	86403	86386	86386	their	1248	” He snapped his fingers . “
86410	86428	86386	86386	their	1248	” I could already see it happening with my kids , so I knew he was right . “
86436	86441	86386	86386	their	1248	” Sawyer sighed again . “
86483	86491	86475	86475	your	1250	” I looked at him with concern . “
86498	86505	86475	86475	your	1250	” He waved a hand dismissively . “
86537	86538	86532	86532	I	0	” “
86543	86611	86612	86612	You	1250	” He looked around my office , and the silence grew slightly uncomfortable . Did he know about Frannie and me ? Did he know it was over ? I felt like I owed him an apology , like I ’d taken advantage of his trust and generosity . I was trying to think of a way to get it off my chest when he spoke again . “
86623	86659	86615	86615	Mack	1505	” He picked up the photo of me and the girls I ’d been looking at earlier and took it in his lap . I felt his kind words like a kick in the gut . “
86665	86666	86663	86663	sir	1505	” “
86680	86681	86683	86683	you	1505	” “
86688	86694	86695	86695	I	0	” I cleared my throat . “
86707	86714	86695	86695	I	0	” He looked up at me . “
86722	86745	86719	86720	a team	1253	” I nodded . My throat was too dry to speak . Setting the photo back on the desk , he said , “
86824	86825	86805	86805	I	0	” “
86831	86989	86805	86805	I	0	” I attempted to smile , but I felt like shit . I did n’t deserve his kindness after what I ’d done to Frannie . I did n’t deserve to have him refer to me as family or offer to go fishing with me or think of me as a surrogate son . Had that been his way of telling me he was okay with a relationship between me and his daughter ? Dammit , I did n’t deserve that either ! I almost wished he ’d come at me red - faced and angry , railing about how I could n’t treat her like that and get away with it . I wished he ’d thrown a punch . I arrived home on edge , and Frannie barely looked at me before hugging the kids goodbye and disappearing into the back hall to put on her boots and coat . Again , I followed her . “
87001	87005	86805	86805	I	0	” I asked . “
87008	87015	86805	86805	I	0	” She pulled on her boots . “
87022	87023	87024	87024	I	0	” “
87057	87058	87040	87040	They	227	” “
87061	87138	87139	87139	I	0	” She zipped up her coat and put her hat on . She wore braids in her hair again today , and for some reason the sight of them made me even sadder . I ’d never smell her hair again . Or brush it . Or see it spilling across my pillow , dangling above my chest , cascading down her naked back . I stuck my hands in my pockets , my heart aching . “
87148	87278	87279	87279	Daddy	36	” She barely looked at me before walking out , closing the door behind her . For a few frantic seconds , I tried to think of some reason — any reason — to run after her , keep her here a little longer . But I could n’t . Instead I went to the living room , moved the curtain aside , and peeked out the front window , watching as she got into her car . She started the engine , but did n’t go anywhere right away . I thought maybe she was on the phone or texting someone , but then she dropped her face into her hands and I realized she was crying . My chest felt like it was being split in two . “
87286	87295	87279	87279	Daddy	36	” asked Felicity , coming up behind me . “
87298	87310	87279	87279	Daddy	36	” I said , letting the curtain fall into place again . “
87322	87341	87344	87344	she	1261	” she said , jumping onto the couch and pushing the curtain aside again . Then she gasped . “
87348	87349	87344	87344	she	1261	” “
87354	87382	87344	87344	she	1261	” Immediately the other two girls jumped onto the couch and craned their necks for a better view . I yanked the curtain in front of them . “
87388	87389	87390	87390	She	1261	” “
87397	87401	87390	87390	She	1261	” Millie said . “
87414	87415	87410	87410	she	1261	” “
87418	87422	87410	87410	she	1261	” I yelled . “
87427	87449	87410	87410	she	1261	” All three girls looked at me in surprise . I ran a hand through my hair and lowered my voice . “
87461	87462	87457	87457	Frannie	1505	” “
87468	87472	87473	87473	She	1261	” Millie persisted . “
87484	87485	87473	87473	She	1261	” “
87490	87515	87487	87487	I	0	” I snapped . I thought about her gentle , trusting father and his kind words to me this afternoon and felt even worse . “
87522	87530	87517	87517	you	1505	” Winnie asked , her tone accusatory . “
87547	87548	87549	87549	Me	0	” “
87552	87556	87549	87549	Me	0	” added Felicity . “
87567	87568	87549	87549	Me	0	” “
87576	87585	87574	87574	Frannie	1505	” Millie crossed her arms over her chest . “
87599	87600	87594	87594	You	1505	” “
87615	87616	87613	87613	Frannie	1505	” “
87624	87625	87613	87613	Frannie	1505	” “
87632	87660	87628	87628	I	0	” I yelled . Winnie started to cry and ran up the stairs . Felicity and Millie exchanged a look that said OMG Dad Is Losing It . “
87663	87672	87674	87674	dads	690	” I said , trying to stay calm . “
87698	87699	87691	87691	they	690	” “
87710	87721	87700	87700	Frannie	1505	” said Felicity , pushing her glasses up her nose . “
87738	87739	87740	87740	Me	0	” “
87743	87770	87771	87771	I	0	” Millie shook her head . Sighing , I flopped onto the other end of the couch and lay my head back . Closed my eyes . “
87784	87825	87826	87826	Frannie	1505	” They did n’t say anything for a few minutes . I thought they might have even gone upstairs , but when I opened my eyes , they were still there looking at me . Then I had an idea . “
87838	87862	87830	87830	she	1267	” I said . They looked at each other and then back at me , their expressions a mixture of shock and panic . “
87865	87869	87830	87830	she	1267	” Felicity cried . “
87872	87873	87830	87830	she	1267	” “
87894	87895	87896	87896	She	1267	” “
87906	87915	87896	87896	She	1267	” Millie asked . I shook my head . “
87918	87919	87896	87896	She	1267	” “
87928	87937	87938	87938	She	1267	” Felicity said , tears filling her eyes . “
87947	87955	87938	87938	She	1267	” protested Millie , her voice cracking . “
87965	87983	87984	87984	I	0	” I exhaled , tipping my head back again . I ’d forgotten about that damn show . “
87992	88027	87984	87984	I	0	” Both of them started to cry , which made my temper flare again . I ’d lost her too , but you did n’t see me crying — although I felt like it . “
88034	88038	88031	88031	you	0	” I snapped . “
88056	88072	88046	88046	She	1267	” That made them sob harder , and Felicity wiped her nose on her sleeve . “
88078	88082	88046	88046	She	1267	” she wept . “
88098	88107	88046	88046	She	1267	” I ordered like the ogre I was . “
88116	88146	88046	88046	She	1267	” They jumped off the couch and ran upstairs , and I heard two doors slam a moment later . From above came the sounds of wailing and despair . “
88149	88153	88154	88158	Fucking Father of the Year	1272	” I muttered . “
88160	88564	88154	88158	Fucking Father of the Year	1272	” I sat there for a moment and listened to my children sob , wishing I could cry it out myself . This week had been nothing but misery and stress . A little release would feel pretty damn good right now . But I could n’t . I owed my children an apology , an ice cream cone , and a hug — if they ’d let me give them one . After sitting there for a while , stewing in my own self - imposed agony , I got to my feet and headed slowly up the stairs , my head pounding , my nerves shot , and my heart in a million little pieces . Frannie Saturday morning , I slipped into the high school cafeteria where the fashion show was taking place , hoping I was n’t too late . It was crowded and all the chairs were taken , so I stood along the back wall with some other late - comers . I ’d been working at the bakery that morning and had lost track of time — baking in the huge , beautiful kitchen at Coffee Darling had salved my soul this week , especially after seeing Mack Thursday and Friday . It had been even harder than I ’d expected . It broke my heart even further to think that I would n’t see the girls much anymore , but I understood why he wanted to get a new nanny . And I ’d go out of my way to visit them when I knew he would n’t be there . I did n’t want them to think I did n’t care about them anymore just because I was n’t their nanny now . The fashion show was in full swing , with mothers and daughters walking the runway arm in arm wearing matching outfits they ’d created themselves . The theme of the show was Healing Hunger with Hearts , and all proceeds were going to an organization fighting hunger . An announcer introduced each model , and I watched eight mother - daughter pairs proudly stroll to the end of the runway and back , hearts on their shirts and grins on their faces . I hoped I had n’t missed Millie and Mack already . Glancing around at the crowd , I spotted Felicity and Winnie sitting together in the front row . “
88573	88587	88565	88567	Our final duo	1274	” said the announcer , and I immediately focused on the runway again . “
88604	88857	88602	88602	Declan	55	” The crowd cheered , and Mack and Millie appeared , hand in hand . My breath stopped for a moment . Millie was beaming , absolutely radiant in the white T - shirt covered with pink and red glitter hearts she ’d made . Mack looked pretty miserable at first , but as they made their way to the end of the runway , which bisected the cafeteria , Millie looked up at him and he met her eyes . Seeing how happy and proud she was must have buoyed his spirits , because he grinned back at her and seemed to walk a little taller , puffing his glitter - covered chest out . When they reached the end of the runway , Mack turned Millie under his arm as if they were on the dance floor , bowed to her , and kissed her cheek . The crowd went crazy . My heart was pounding so hard I could barely hear the music , and tears dripped from my eyes , but I could n’t help laughing a little . It was the kind of thing my dad would have done for one of his girls , too — my sweet , gruff , and gentle dad who ’d come into the bakery for coffee that morning just to see me , because he missed seeing me at the inn . I ’d filled his cup , introduced him to Natalie and her husband , and showed him around . “
88866	88885	88858	88858	I	0	” he ’d said , pulling me into a hug . The nickname made my throat close up . “
88890	88891	88888	88888	Daddy	36	” “
88896	88913	88893	88893	you	0	” I ’d nodded , my eyes filling . Embarrassed , I wiped at the tears . “
88916	88990	88991	88991	Millie	37	” And it was mostly true — I was happy with my decision to leave the inn , partner up with Natalie , and work at the shop , but I was heartsick about Mack . He ’d left a hole in my heart that could n’t be filled with anything else . Watching him now , I choked back sobs even as I clapped along with everyone else when the announcer said , “
89028	89271	89272	89272	Frannie	1505	” The show concluded with all the models appearing and taking a final bow , and for a moment , Mack caught my eye . My stomach flipped . My pulse skittered nervously out of control . We stood with our eyes locked for a full ten seconds , neither of us smiling , and for a moment I felt like maybe he ’d been as miserable as I ’d been this week and was sorry he ’d broken things off . But then he looked away , and my heart sank . I decided not to wait around to talk to Millie . Seeing Mack was too painful . I did n’t trust myself to get close to him without crying . Instead , I slipped out of the cafeteria and hurried through the parking lot to my car , where I sent her a text . Millie , you looked amazing ! I am so proud of you and I hope you had so much fun ! Sorry I could not stay to chat , I am working at the new shop and have to get back . I will see you soon , I promise ! ! Tears running down my cheeks , I dropped my phone into my bag and drove back to work , wondering how long it took to fall out of love with someone . I was n’t sure my heart could take it . Mack “
89275	89289	89290	89290	She	1281	” Millie exclaimed from the back of the car on the drive home . “
89294	89295	89290	89290	She	1281	” “
89302	89306	89290	89290	She	1281	” Felicity whined . “
89312	89313	89314	89314	She	1281	” “
89320	89327	89328	89328	Dad	140	” Millie read the text aloud . “
89344	89345	89335	89335	we	1282	” “
89349	89365	89335	89335	we	1282	” All three moaned in grand symphonic fashion and followed it up with more whining . “
89373	89374	89369	89369	Dad	140	” “
89378	89386	89369	89369	Dad	140	“ You never say yes to anything . ”
89387	89395	89369	89369	Dad	140	“ You ’re no fun this week . ”
89396	89406	89369	89369	Dad	140	“ What else are we going to do today ? ”
89407	89425	89369	89369	Dad	140	“ Finally I do n’t have ballet on a Saturday and we just have to go home ? ”
89633	89636	89637	89637	I	0	“ Dad . ”
89661	89665	89666	89666	Millie	37	“ What now ? ”
89671	89679	89666	89666	Millie	37	“ We ’re calling a family meeting . ”
89680	89684	89666	89666	Millie	37	“ You are ? ”
89685	89696	89666	89666	Millie	37	“ Yes . Right now . In the living room . ”
89697	89711	89712	89712	I	0	“ Ca n’t it wait ? I need to make a grocery list . ”
89728	89739	89712	89712	I	0	“ No . It ca n’t . We ’ve decided . ”
89740	89744	89712	89712	I	0	“ Decided what ? ”
89745	89759	89760	89760	I	0	“ That you ’re being an idiot and you need the hard words . ”
89765	89770	89760	89760	I	0	“ Well , damn . ”
89771	89777	89778	89778	She	37	“ Living room , please . ”
89804	89808	89809	89809	Felicity	38	“ Sit there , ”
89848	89855	89856	89856	Millie	37	“ We have something to say , ”
89859	89863	89856	89856	Millie	37	“ I know . ”
89871	89877	89864	89864	I	0	“ Get on with it . ”
89878	89884	89886	89886	Winnie	461	“ It ’s about Frannie , ”
89893	89903	89888	89888	I	0	“ I do n’t want to talk about Frannie . ”
89904	89912	89913	89913	Millie	37	“ Well , you ’re going to ! ”
89942	89960	89888	89888	I	0	“ Or you ’re at least going to listen , because we ca n’t take it anymore . ”
89961	89965	89888	89888	I	0	“ Take what ? ”
89966	89995	89996	89996	My	0	“ Your terrible mood since you two broke up ! We do n’t understand why you ’re not in love anymore and we want to know what happened . ”
90001	90015	89996	89996	My	0	“ What do you mean ? Frannie and I were n’t in love ! ”
90030	90035	90026	90026	Someone	186	“ Dad . Please . ”
90042	90050	90036	90036	Millie	37	“ You guys were totally in love . ”
90051	90060	90062	90062	Felicity	38	“ It was , like , so obvious , ”
90069	90075	90076	90076	she	37	“ It was , Daddy , ”
90079	90090	90076	90076	she	37	“ I saw you in the closet . ‘ Member ? ”
90091	90100	90102	90102	Millie	37	“ And I saw you in the kitchen , ”
90104	90120	90121	90121	Felicity	38	“ And I saw you all the time , everywhere , with your googly eyes . ”
90131	90139	90121	90121	Felicity	38	“ I did n’t even need these ! ”
90147	90171	90140	90140	I	0	“ Girls , you do n’t understand . Even if we did have feelings for each other , we ca n’t be together . ”
90172	90176	90177	90177	Millie	37	“ Why not ? ”
90180	90191	90192	90192	I	0	“ Because I do n’t have any time for her , ”
90195	90213	90192	90192	I	0	“ I ’m busy with you guys and with work . It ’s not fair to her . ”
90214	90222	90223	90223	Millie	37	“ She did n’t seem to mind . ”
90232	90256	90257	90257	I	0	“ And she was here all the time , so it ’s not like you had to leave us to go see her . ”
90262	90334	90335	90335	They	1298	“ Girls , you ’re too young to understand this , but relationships are a lot of work . You have to invest a lot of time and energy into them , and … I ’m no good at that . Look at what happened before . I ca n’t go through it again , and I definitely would n’t put you through it again . I love you too much . ”
90340	90345	90346	90346	Millie	37	“ We get that , ”
90349	90373	90374	90374	I	0	“ But we also know that Frannie is not like Mom at all . She ’s different . So everything would be different . ”
90379	90398	90399	90399	I	0	“ I hear what you ’re saying , but there are other reasons why it wo n’t work , ”
90419	90423	90399	90399	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
90497	90503	90492	90492	Frannie	1505	“ I do n’t know . ”
90504	90507	90509	90511	the tough guy	1301	“ Daddy . ”
90523	90529	90514	90514	Millie	37	“ Do you love her ? ”
90538	90565	90566	90566	Winnie	461	“ Then it ’s like I said — remember ? When you love someone , you want to be with them . You agreed with me . ”
90580	90605	90566	90566	Winnie	461	“ It ’s like me and Ned the Hammerhead from Shedd . I do n’t feel right if he ’s not next to me . ”
90615	90622	90606	90606	I	0	“ It ’s exactly like that . ”
90623	90633	90634	90634	Felicity	38	“ You have to get her back , Dad . ”
90648	90652	90606	90606	I	0	“ Can you ? ”
90653	90659	90660	90660	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
90663	90680	90681	90681	Millie	37	“ She ’s pretty upset with me . I told her we had to end things . ”
90684	90690	90691	90691	I	0	“ That was really stupid . ”
90697	90743	90691	90691	I	0	“ Hey . I thought I was doing the right thing . I thought I was doing it for you . Being your dad is the most important thing in my entire life , and I do n’t want anything to take away from that . ”
90756	90788	90751	90751	Winnie	461	“ But Daddy , just because I sleep every night with Ned right by me does n’t mean I do n’t love you . It ’s a different kind of love . ”
90796	90811	90789	90789	I	0	“ You ’re right , Winn . It is a different kind of love . ”
90812	90825	90826	90826	Millie	37	“ And you have been in the worst mood all week long , ”
90829	90838	90826	90826	Millie	37	“ We really ca n’t take it anymore . ”
90839	90847	90848	90848	Felicity	38	“ We love her too , Daddy . ”
90859	90866	90848	90848	Felicity	38	“ Please go get her back . ”
90867	90879	90880	90880	I	0	“ What if I try and it does n’t work out ? ”
90883	90891	90880	90880	I	0	“ Are you going to hate me ? ”
90892	90895	90896	90896	Winnie	461	“ No , ”
90900	90907	90896	90896	Winnie	461	“ We ’ll always love you . ”
90908	90932	90933	90933	Millie	37	“ But if you do n’t at least try to get her back , we ’ll be really mad for a long time , ”
91028	91036	91021	91021	I	0	“ Okay . Will you help me ? ”
91037	91041	91042	91042	Millie	37	“ Of course ! ”
91050	91053	91054	91054	Winnie	461	“ Yes ! ”
91069	91080	91058	91058	Felicity	38	“ But Dad ! You better take my lucky stone . ”
91108	91145	91096	91096	I	0	“ Thanks . I ’ll take all the luck I can get . But you know what , girls ? Right now I feel like the luckiest man alive because I get to be your dad . ”
91146	91155	91157	91157	Felicity	38	“ I ’ll give you a hug now , ”
91185	91191	91192	91192	Millie	37	“ Can we go now ? ”
91258	91264	91246	91246	I	0	“ Fuck , you guys . ”

91294	91301	91302	91302	Winnie	461	“ But you can do this . ”
91307	91313	91302	91302	Winnie	461	“ We believe in you . ”
91314	91333	91334	91334	Felicity	38	“ We wo n’t even make you put a dollar in the swear jar until we get back , ”
91346	91354	91337	91337	she	461	“ Come on , let ’s go ! ”
91396	91399	91400	91400	Millie	37	“ What ? ”
91407	91419	91400	91400	Millie	37	“ I should have changed my clothes . I ’m wearing … ”
91429	91433	91420	91420	I	0	“ Pink glitter . ”
91434	91443	91444	91444	Felicity	38	“ Zip up your coat all the way , ”
91447	91450	91451	91451	Millie	37	“ No ! ”
91455	91485	91451	91451	Millie	37	“ The shirt is a statement about love and healing hearts . Plus Frannie helped make it . He should show her that he ’s proud to wear it . ”
91492	91500	91501	91501	She	37	“ You ’re pretty smart for eleven . ”
91504	91510	91501	91501	She	37	“ I ’m almost twelve . ”
91518	91531	91511	91511	I	0	“ Do n’t remind me . Okay , let ’s do this . ”
91532	91542	91543	91543	Winnie	461	“ Daddy , what are you going to say ? ”
91556	91562	91546	91546	her	37	“ I have no idea . ”
91563	91580	91581	91581	Felicity	38	“ I think you should tell her you ’re sorry for being a big fat jerk , ”
91596	91599	91589	91589	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
91600	91610	91611	91611	Millie	37	“ And maybe you should beg for her forgiveness , ”
91614	91630	91611	91611	Millie	37	“ On your knees or something . That ’s what they do in the movies . ”
91631	91641	91589	91589	I	0	“ I think I ’ll stay on my feet . ”
91642	91649	91650	91650	Winnie	461	“ Tell her she ’s pretty , ”
91653	91660	91661	91661	Felicity	38	“ Tell her she ’s perfect ! ”
91664	91671	91672	91672	Millie	37	“ Tell her you love her . ”
91681	91694	91695	91695	I	0	“ That ’s important . She needs to hear you say that . ”
91700	91707	91708	91708	Winnie	461	“ I ’m going to die . ”
91711	91718	91708	91708	Winnie	461	“ Not , you ’re not . ”
91727	91751	91752	91752	She	37	“ You ’re not going to die . You ’re going to fix this and get her back — for all of us . ”
91777	91784	91764	91764	She	37	“ Daddy , it ’s locked . ”
91785	91791	91792	91792	Winnie	461	“ We ’re too late , ”
91795	91801	91792	91792	Winnie	461	“ The hell we are . ”
91831	91847	91830	91830	Frannie	1505	“ Frannie ? There ’s someone here to see you . Several people , actually . ”
91878	91883	91869	91869	his	1316	“ To see me ? ”
91884	91897	91898	91898	His	1316	“ That ’s what they said . A guy and some kids . ”
91906	91926	91898	91898	His	1316	“ And the guy is wearing some kind of sparkly T - shirt . You better come up front . ”
92009	92012	92013	92013	I	0	“ Hi , ”
92017	92020	92013	92013	I	0	“ Hi . ”
92166	92169	92171	92171	Millie	37	“ Dad , ”
92179	92183	92171	92171	Millie	37	“ Say something . ”
92184	92189	92190	92190	Mack	1505	“ I ’m trying . ”
92195	92206	92190	92190	Mack	1505	“ This is n’t easy . Give me a second . ”
92207	92212	92213	92213	Miles	141	“ Take your time , ”
92216	92227	92228	92228	Natalie	123	“ Miles , maybe we should give them some privacy ? ”
92242	92253	92255	92255	Miles	141	“ But Nat , something good is about to happen , ”
92257	92279	92280	92280	Mack	1505	“ I can tell . A dude does n’t wear a glittery T - shirt for nothing . This is big . ”
92289	92292	92280	92280	Mack	1505	“ Um . ”
92293	92296	92297	92297	Felicity	38	“ Dad . ”
92309	92315	92297	92297	Felicity	38	“ Come on , already . ”
92316	92319	92320	92320	Mack	1505	“ Okay . ”
92345	92386	92387	92387	Miles	141	“ Frannie , I came here today to tell you something — well several things . First , that I ’m sorry . I know I hurt you , and I ’m so sorry . This is all my fault . ”
92391	92400	92387	92387	Miles	141	“ Taking all the blame . Nice move . ”
92401	92404	92405	92405	Natalie	123	“ Miles ! ”
92412	92419	92420	92420	Miles	141	“ What ? He needs encouragement , ”
92428	92439	92440	92440	Mack	1505	“ Go on , man . You ’re doing fine . ”
92443	92446	92447	92447	he	1505	“ Thanks , ”
92458	92483	92484	92484	He	1505	“ Not only did I hurt you , but you were right : I did it for a stupid reason — I was afraid . ”
92489	92543	92484	92484	He	1505	“ Fuck , I ’m still afraid . I feel like there ’s no way I can do this , be the best father possible and be the guy you want . There ’s only one of me , and half the time , I have no fucking idea what I ’m doing . ”
92544	92551	92552	92552	Miles	141	“ I hear that , brother . ”
92555	92582	92552	92552	Miles	141	“ Being a dad is the hardest thing I ’ve ever done . I ca n’t imagine what it would be like facing that job alone . ”
92583	92594	92484	92484	He	1505	“ But you do n’t have to face it alone . ”
92611	92641	92599	92599	I	0	“ That ’s the thing , Mack . I do n’t expect you to divide your time , to try to be all things to all people at once . ”
92642	92649	92650	92650	he	1505	“ I know you do n’t , ”
92657	92721	92722	92722	His	1505	“ Just like I know I ’m going to fail you sometimes , and the kids sometimes , and myself sometimes . I ’ve never been a perfect man , but I felt like I had to be the perfect father , to make up for what they lost . And I thought that meant I had to put my own needs aside . ”
92726	92732	92722	92722	His	1505	“ But I ca n’t . ”
92733	92740	92741	92741	I	0	“ You do n’t have to . ”
92746	92784	92785	92785	I	0	“ We can make it work , Mack . I know you ’re not perfect , and I know being a good dad is your most important priority , but you deserve to be happy , too . ”
92792	92796	92785	92785	I	0	“ Right girls ? ”
92797	92800	92801	92801	they	1391	“ Right , ”
92804	92815	92816	92816	Millie	37	“ And he was n’t happy at all this week , ”
92820	92825	92827	92827	Winnie	461	“ He was grouchy , ”
92829	92833	92835	92835	Felicity	38	“ And mean , ”
92837	92848	92849	92849	Miles	141	“ Come on , give him a break , girls . ”
92854	92893	92894	92894	He	1505	“ He was lonely . He ’d walked away from Frannie because he thought he was doing the right thing , and he had to spend some time being miserable to realize what an idiot he ’d been . ”
92899	92904	92905	92905	Mack	1505	“ Am I right ? ”
92908	92918	92919	92919	He	1505	“ Yeah . And it did n’t take long . ”
92925	92968	92919	92919	He	1505	“ I do n’t know where we end up . I do n’t know how all these pieces of my life are going to fit together . I do n’t know how you ’re going to put up with all my shit . ”
92969	92977	92978	92978	I	0	“ Do you have a swear jar ? ”
92985	92991	92992	92992	Mack	1505	“ But I do know , ”
93004	93044	92992	92992	Mack	1505	“ that my life is much better with you in it , and if you ’re willing to take this crazy journey with me — the back seat already full — I’m willing to see where this road leads . ”
93051	93057	92992	92992	Mack	1505	“ Do you mean it ? ”
93058	93061	93069	93069	Winnie	461	“ Yes . ”
93062	93068	93069	93069	Winnie	461	“ Because he loves you ! ”
93073	93078	93069	93069	Winnie	461	“ He told us ! ”
93079	93082	93083	93085	her older sisters	1325	“ Winnie ! ”
93095	93101	93088	93088	Felicity	38	“ What ? He diiiid . ”
93107	93113	93102	93102	Winnie	461	“ He should tell her . ”
93114	93119	93120	93120	I	0	“ It ’s okay , ”
93138	93144	93102	93102	Winnie	461	“ This is more than — ”
93145	93150	93151	93151	Mack	1505	“ She ’s right . ”
93172	93220	93164	93164	He	1505	“ I told them , and I ’ll tell you . I love you , Frannie . I do n’t know if I ’m any good at it . God knows I failed in the past . But I love you . And when you love someone … ”
93238	93253	93221	93221	He	1505	“ You want to be with them . I want to be with you . ”
93254	93259	93260	93260	Miles	141	“ Aw , dude . ”
93265	93271	93260	93260	Miles	141	“ You ’re killing me . ”
93272	93276	93277	93277	Winnie	461	“ Kiss her ! ”
93284	93293	93277	93277	Winnie	461	“ And not in the closet this time ! ”
93319	93326	93327	93327	Millie	37	“ Okay , that ’s enough , ”
93330	93336	93327	93327	Millie	37	“ Do n’t get gross . ”
93348	93357	93358	93358	They	1391	“ Come here , girls . Group hug . ”
93379	93385	93386	93386	I	0	“ Thank you , girls , ”
93395	93428	93386	93386	I	0	“ This means everything to me . I want to be with your dad , but I want to be with you , too . I want us all to be together . ”
93429	93437	93438	93438	Millie	37	“ We love you too , Frannie , ”
93441	93449	93450	93450	Miles	141	“ You ’re part of our family . ”
93463	93469	93470	93470	he	141	“ That was fucking beautiful , ”
93473	93480	93470	93470	he	141	“ Miles ! Watch your language ! ”
93485	93492	93494	93494	Felicity	38	“ Oh , that ’s okay , ”
93499	93506	93494	93494	Felicity	38	“ We ’re used to it . ”
93592	93603	93604	93604	she	224	“ I ca n’t believe he came here that way , ”
93611	93618	93604	93604	she	224	“ Are you totally in shock ? ”
93619	93646	93604	93604	she	224	“ Pretty much . When I left his house yesterday , I was fairly certain things were done . He seemed unhappy but unwilling to budge . ”
93647	93660	93661	93661	She	224	“ Thank goodness for those girls , huh ? What smart kids . ”
93664	93690	93691	93691	I	0	“ Every time I think about that little one yelling , ‘ Because he loves you ! He told us ! ’ I crack up . ”
93706	93715	93691	93691	I	0	“ Winnie . She ’s such a doll . ”
93716	93725	93604	93604	she	224	“ So you get along with them all ? ”
93726	93766	93691	93691	I	0	“ A hundred percent . I know I ca n’t replace their mom , and there will probably come a day when I ’ll side with their dad on something and they ’ll hate me for it , but — ”
93767	93774	93775	93775	she	0	“ Welcome to being a parent , ”
93778	93783	93784	93784	She	0	“ Speaking of which . ”
93792	93803	93804	93804	I	0	“ This one is all kinds of crazy this afternoon . ”
93807	93816	93804	93804	I	0	“ It ’s been that kind of day . ”
94026	94033	94035	94035	Millie	37	“ Find beauty in ordinary things , ”
94037	94045	94047	94047	Felicity	38	“ You will live a happy life , ”
94049	94059	94061	94061	Mack	1505	“ You will be hungry again in one hour , ”
94072	94078	94067	94067	Winnie	461	“ Can you read mine ? ”
94079	94082	94083	94083	I	0	“ Sure , ”
94086	94100	94083	94083	I	0	“ It says , ‘ When one door closes , another opens . ’ ”
94101	94107	94108	94108	she	37	“ What does that mean ? ”
94111	94139	94140	94140	I	0	“ Well , I think it means that you should n’t dwell on the bad stuff in life , because something good is about to come along . ”
94145	94153	94154	94154	Felicity	38	“ What does yours say , Frannie ? ”
94157	94167	94169	94169	Mack	1505	“ Beware of single dads who ca n’t cook ? ”
94174	94178	94179	94179	I	0	“ For real . ”
94188	94197	94179	94179	I	0	“ Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . ”
94198	94203	94205	94205	Winnie	461	“ I like that , ”
94207	94215	94205	94205	Winnie	461	“ But what ’s a willing heart ? ”
94216	94225	94226	94226	I	0	“ A heart that ’s open to anything , ”
94234	94261	94226	94226	I	0	“ And guess what ? When I was young , I had three open - heart surgeries . So I think mine is open for sure . ”
94269	94277	94278	94278	Felicity	38	“ So nothing is impossible for you , ”
94289	94294	94282	94282	I	0	“ Nope . Nothing . ”
94332	94340	94341	94341	I	0	“ Are you sure this is okay ? ”
94358	94361	94344	94344	he	1505	“ Positive . ”
94386	94391	94392	94392	I	0	“ This is nice , ”
94405	94409	94392	94392	I	0	“ It is . ”
94418	94426	94427	94427	I	0	“ Although I wish you were naked . ”
94430	94439	94427	94427	I	0	“ Not with the kids in the house . ”
94440	94459	94427	94427	I	0	“ I know . But I ’m going to get impatient with this high school stuff pretty soon . ”
94460	94465	94466	94466	I	0	“ We have time . ”
94479	94486	94487	94487	He	1505	“ I ’m not going anywhere . ”
94495	94520	94487	94487	He	1505	“ I ’m not either . Does n’t mean I do n’t want to rip your clothes off and fuck you senseless right now . ”
94521	94527	94530	94530	he	1505	“ You ’re so romantic . ”
94541	94566	94530	94530	he	1505	“ Sorry . But beneath my pink glittery heart T - shirt is an animal with a hairy chest and a hard - on . ”
94567	94571	94577	94577	him	1505	“ Oh yeah ? ”
94590	94600	94601	94601	He	1505	“ What do you know ? You ’re right . ”
94613	94629	94601	94601	He	1505	“ Are you sure we ca n’t sneak into my bedroom for a few minutes ? ”
94639	94649	94634	94634	he	1505	“ Wo n’t that feel so good inside you ? ”
94678	94694	94695	94695	he	1505	“ Do n’t you want my mouth on you ? We can be so quiet , ”
94704	94715	94695	94695	he	1505	“ Come on . Let me make you feel good . ”
94716	94721	94722	94722	I	0	“ You ’re terrible , ”
94739	94748	94725	94725	his	1505	“ I know . But I love you . ”
94760	94766	94755	94755	I	0	“ I love you too . ”
94767	94805	94808	94808	I	0	“ So come to bed with me . I ’ve missed you so much . And I promise I wo n’t always be so terrible — we’ll behave tomorrow night . Tonight , let ’s give in . ”
94910	94937	94907	94907	Winnie	461	“ Frannie should just move in here . Then she would n’t have to leave so early in the morning and she could make breakfast sometimes . ”
94938	94941	94942	94942	Millie	37	“ Totally , ”
95025	95059	95013	95013	he	1505	“ Not only are you a much better cook than me , but you know how to do all kinds of braids , you smell better , and you ’re much more patient . ”
95060	95071	95072	95072	I	0	“ And you ’re sure it ’s what you want ? ”
95212	95217	95226	95226	he	1505	“ Are you kidding ? ”
95237	95262	95226	95226	he	1505	“ Of course it ’s what I want . This house would n’t even feel like home without you anymore . You belong here . ”
95269	95282	95263	95263	I	0	“ I used to dream of hearing you say that to me . ”
95283	95291	95263	95263	I	0	“ Then tell me you ’ll stay . ”
95320	95325	95333	95333	he	1505	“ I ’ll stay . ”
95398	95408	95409	95409	I	0	“ What ? How am I supposed to pack ? ”
95417	95443	95412	95412	He	1505	“ Pack for an elegant destination . Not the beach . Not the mountains . Not the desert . That ’s all I ’m saying . ”
95490	95494	95487	95487	Felicity	38	“ Bon voyage ! ”
95500	95506	95487	95487	Felicity	38	“ Do n’t ruin it ! ”
95507	95533	95541	95541	he	1363	“ I did n’t ! That ’s what you say when someone goes on a trip , even if they ’re not going to France ! ”
95556	95567	95552	95552	I	0	“ Oh my God ! Do you have my passport ? ”
95568	95574	95575	95575	I	0	“ Of course I do . ”
95587	95599	95575	95575	I	0	“ This is too much . It ’s just a birthday . ”
95600	95644	95645	95645	I	0	“ It ’s not . It ’s a chance for me to do something for you and show you how much I appreciate all you do for me . And it was time for you to get a stamp in that passport already . ”
95648	95658	95645	95645	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe this . Pinch me ! ”
95659	95675	95676	95676	He	1364	“ I ’d be happy to , but you ’re not going to wake up . ”
95687	95693	95676	95676	He	1364	“ This is real life . ”
95877	95880	95870	95870	I	0	“ Mack . ”
95886	95894	95895	95895	He	1505	“ No way . You did n’t . ”
96067	96076	96077	96077	I	0	“ So ? Is it everything you expected ? ”
96081	96099	96077	96077	I	0	“ More . I ’m only sorry the kids are n’t here . They ’d love this ! ”
96100	96112	96077	96077	I	0	“ We ’ll bring them back someday . How about that ? ”
96113	96122	96123	96123	I	0	“ Do you think we ’ll come back ? ”
96145	96169	96173	96173	him	1381	“ Of course I do . We ’ll want to show them exactly where we were when I asked you to marry me . ”
96175	96178	96179	96179	He	1381	“ What ? ”
96192	96202	96203	96203	he	1381	“ The box would n’t fit in my pocket , ”
96207	96225	96226	96226	He	1381	“ I did n’t plan that part very well . Which brings me to my next point . ”
96231	96286	96226	96226	He	1381	“ I ’m no prince , Frannie . I ’m stubborn , I ’m impatient , I have a foul mouth and a lot of fucking baggage . And I come attached to three small humans who run me ragged every day . But I love you more than I ’ve ever loved anyone . ”

96544	96599	96529	96529	he	1381	“ Not really , I was just afraid I ’d fuck it up somehow . Lose the ring , forget what I wanted to say , screw up the directions to get here . There was a lot depending on my ability to get things right , and I do n’t always trust myself . ”

96671	96725	96612	96612	My	0	“ Only after we left . I did n’t trust them to keep the secret , so I called them while you were in the shower yesterday and told them it was happening . But they ’ve known for a while I wanted to ask . And Millie helped me choose the ring . ”

96739	96746	96747	96747	I	0	“ Mmhm . Millie and April . ”
