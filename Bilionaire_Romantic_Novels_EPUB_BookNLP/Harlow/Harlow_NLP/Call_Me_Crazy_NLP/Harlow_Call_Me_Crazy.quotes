1077	1082	1083	1083	I	1723	“ You ’re welcome . ”
1116	1124	1108	1108	I	1723	“ Did n’t you like the wine ? ”
1125	1128	1129	1129	She	46	“ Truth ? ”
1132	1151	1129	1129	She	46	“ I ’m not a huge red wine person . But I did n’t want to be rude . ”
1152	1164	1165	1165	I	1723	“ It ’s not rude to ask for what you want , ”
1168	1177	1165	1165	I	1723	“ Let ’s get you what you want . ”
1178	1187	1129	1129	She	46	“ Can I just have a Diet Coke ? ”

1272	1279	1257	1257	She	46	“ You got me a present ? ”
1280	1285	1286	1286	I	1723	“ I might have . ”
1297	1317	1286	1286	I	1723	“ Enzo , you did n’t have to get me anything . You took me out to dinner tonight . ”
1318	1336	1286	1286	I	1723	“ Listen , you only turn twenty - one once . I wanted to make it memorable . ”
1337	1345	1346	1346	I	1723	“ Awww . That ’s so sweet . ”
1373	1381	1382	1382	Her	46	“ Well ? What do you say ? ”
1404	1409	1387	1387	She	46	“ What is that ? ”
1410	1417	1418	1418	I	1723	“ It ’s an engagement ring . ”
1434	1454	1387	1387	She	46	“ I — I can see that . But why are you showing me an engagement ring right now ? ”
1455	1462	1387	1387	She	46	“ Well . . . because . ”
1479	1486	1471	1471	I	1723	“ I want to be engaged . ”
1487	1491	1387	1387	She	46	“ To me ? ”
1492	1495	1496	1496	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
1501	1505	1496	1496	I	1723	“ To you . ”
1506	1517	1471	1471	I	1723	“ But . . . you did n’t even propose . ”
1518	1524	1471	1471	I	1723	“ Yes , I did . ”
1525	1539	1496	1496	I	1723	“ No , you did n’t . You just showed me the ring . ”
1540	1551	1496	1496	I	1723	“ Oh . I guess I should propose , then . ”
1570	1577	1578	1578	She	1723	“ So will you marry me ? ”
1591	1601	1578	1578	She	1723	“ Um , this is awkward . But no . ”
1602	1605	1606	1606	I	1723	“ What ? ”
1611	1619	1606	1606	I	1723	“ What do you mean , no ? ”
1620	1643	1578	1578	She	1723	“ I mean , no , I wo n’t marry you . We ’ve only been dating for three months , Enzo . ”
1644	1663	1664	1664	She	1723	“ I know , but time flies , and — and — soon it will be four months . ”
1668	1671	1664	1664	She	1723	“ Huh ? ”
1672	1687	1688	1688	I	1723	“ Look , I know this might seem a little . . . sudden , ”
1697	1704	1688	1688	I	1723	“ But I really like you . ”
1705	1709	1664	1664	She	1723	“ You do ? ”
1710	1713	1688	1688	I	1723	“ Sure . ”
1726	1736	1721	1721	Reina	46	“ Then how come you have n’t tried anything ? ”
1737	1743	1688	1688	I	1723	“ What do you mean ? ”
1744	1774	1721	1721	Reina	46	“ I mean , you ’ve kissed me , but that ’s about it . And the few times I tried to initiate something more , you backed off . ”
1775	1783	1784	1784	I	1723	“ I was trying to respect you . ”
1793	1805	1806	1806	She	1723	“ I wanted you to know I was willing to wait . ”
1818	1840	1806	1806	She	1723	“ I know , but . . . it ’s weird to me . I actually thought maybe you were gay . ”
1841	1860	1861	1861	I	1723	“ Just because someone does n’t want to have sex with you does n’t mean he ’s gay , ”
1866	1884	1885	1885	She	1723	“ And what ’s so weird about wanting to respect the girl you ’re going to marry ? ”
1890	1904	1885	1885	She	1723	“ Enzo , for God ’s sake . We ’re not getting married . ”
1905	1909	1806	1806	She	1723	“ Why not ? ”
1910	1970	1885	1885	She	1723	“ To start , I ’m only twenty - one . I ’ve got things I want to do with my life . And when I get married — if I get married — I want my husband to be someone who respects me but also ca n’t keep his hands off me . Someone in love with me . ”
1971	1974	1975	1975	I	1723	“ Love , ”
1980	1987	1975	1975	I	1723	“ What is that , anyway ? ”
1988	2017	2018	2018	She	1723	“ It ’s a thing you should feel for the person you ’re proposing to . And . . . and what is that engraved on the band ? ”
2032	2042	2018	2018	She	1723	“ It says ‘ Love Always , Ricky . ’ ”
2043	2048	1975	1975	I	1723	“ Um . . . ”
2049	2055	2056	2056	She	1723	“ Are you . . . ”
2069	2081	2056	2056	She	1723	“ Are you proposing to me with someone else ’s ring ? ”
2082	2087	2088	2088	I	1723	“ I can explain , ”
2106	2111	2114	2114	she	1723	“ Do n’t bother . ”
2129	2137	2114	2114	she	1723	“ It does n’t matter , anyway . ”
2147	2160	2140	2140	I	1723	“ Wow . I really fucked this up , did n’t I ? ”
2161	2178	2179	2179	Reina	46	“ Yeah . You did . But it ’s not the ring that ’s the problem . ”
2192	2215	2179	2179	Reina	46	“ I ’m not in love with you , Enzo . And you ’re not in love with me , are you ? ”
2226	2232	2233	2233	She	1723	“ And actually . . . ”
2241	2264	2233	2233	She	1723	“ I do n’t think this is going to work . You ’re a little bit . . . old for me . ”
2270	2273	2233	2233	She	1723	“ Huh ? ”
2274	2283	2284	2284	she	1723	“ Not that you ’re old in general , ”
2288	2296	2297	2297	I	1723	“ You ’re just old for me . ”
2332	2357	2327	2327	Reina	46	“ Listen , thanks for dinner , and — and everything , but I think it ’s best if we stop seeing each other . ”
2358	2361	2362	2362	I	1723	“ Fine , ”
2369	2381	2382	2382	she	1723	“ My friends are across the street at The Tipsy Canoe , ”
2403	2416	2382	2382	she	1723	“ So I think I ’m just going to walk over there . ”
2417	2426	2382	2382	she	1723	“ Let me drive you , at least . ”
2451	2468	2469	2469	She	49	“ No , really , you stay and finish the wine . I ’d rather walk . ”
2483	2490	2491	2491	I	1723	“ No hard feelings , right ? ”
2505	2510	2491	2491	I	1723	“ No hard feelings . ”
2511	2514	2515	2515	she	1723	“ Great , ”
2525	2529	2530	2530	She	1723	“ See ya . ”
2566	2569	2570	2570	she	1723	“ Hey , ”
2576	2593	2570	2570	she	1723	“ I just saw your date go out the door . She ditch you or what ? ”
2594	2604	2605	2605	I	1723	“ We mutually decided to go our separate ways , ”
2608	2615	2605	2605	I	1723	“ Tonight ? Or in general ? ”
2616	2620	2570	2570	she	1723	“ In general . ”
2621	2624	2625	2625	She	1723	“ Ah . ”
2628	2632	2625	2625	She	1723	“ You okay ? ”
2633	2638	2640	2640	I	1723	“ I ’m fine . ”
2663	2676	2677	2677	Lara	49	“ You want the bill so you can get out of here ? ”
2684	2741	2677	2677	Lara	49	“ Nah . I do n’t have anywhere to go . Unless you need the table , I ’ll just sit here like an old man and drink wine by myself . This is probably what I ’ll be doing for the rest of my life , anyway . Might as well get used to it . ”
2742	2758	2759	2759	Lara	49	“ Oh , come on . You know you wo n’t be alone for long . ”
2764	2786	2759	2759	Lara	49	“ But stay as long as you like . If I need to kick you out , I ’ll tell you . ”
2787	2798	2799	2799	She	49	“ Thanks . I ’ll leave you a good tip . ”
2804	2810	2799	2799	She	49	“ I know you will . ”
2860	2862	2854	2854	I	1723	“ prove ”
3113	3121	3131	3131	I	1723	“ Hey you . This seat taken ? ”
3161	3168	3169	3169	I	1723	“ Does n’t look like it , ”
3181	3191	3172	3172	She	1472	“ Thanks , I ’d love to join you . ”
3555	3562	3563	3563	I	1723	“ What are you doing here ? ”
3566	3606	3563	3563	I	1723	“ My family was here having dinner for my dad ’s birthday . But our family functions are short and sweet because Grandma Vinnie is ninety - six . She starts to fall asleep after an hour or so . ”
3607	3614	3615	3615	I	1723	“ Wow . Ninety - six . ”
3628	3685	3615	3615	I	1723	“ Yes . And hitched when she was twenty - one , had five kids before she was thirty , and was married to my Grandpa Jack for seventy years before he died . Which she loves to tell me every single time I see her , right before she asks why I ’m still single . ”
3694	3703	3708	3708	she	1472	“ I ’ve got some ideas on that . ”
3715	3739	3708	3708	she	1472	“ So what ’s with you ? I thought I saw you with a date earlier . Either that or you were babysitting . ”
3745	3748	3749	3749	She	1472	“ Funny . ”
3752	3761	3749	3749	She	1472	“ So who was she ? Your girlfriend ? ”
3762	3769	3770	3770	Her	1472	“ No . We broke up . ”
3774	3782	3770	3770	Her	1472	“ Oh . Sorry to hear that . ”
3783	3790	3749	3749	She	1472	“ No , you ’re not . ”
3791	3819	3770	3770	Her	1472	“ Enzo , this might come as a surprise to you , but I am not your enemy . I do n’t even dislike you — much . ”
3820	3827	3828	3828	She	1472	“ Oh yeah ? Since when ? ”
3831	3857	3828	3828	She	1472	“ Since we ’re not immature and awkward kids anymore , who did n’t know how to be friends with someone of the opposite sex ? ”
3858	3872	3873	3873	Her	1472	“ Speak for yourself . I had plenty of friends who were girls . ”
3881	3892	3893	3893	I	1723	“ True . You always were a ladies ’ man . ”
3898	3910	3893	3893	I	1723	“ Whatever . I ’m here alone , are n’t I ? ”
3911	3968	3979	3979	I	1723	“ Wait , are you expecting me to feel sorry for you ? Like you could n’t walk right out of here and pick up the next girl you see ? There ’s not a woman alive who can resist your charms , Enzo . Those dark eyes ? That wavy hair ? The Moretti swagger ? ”
3969	3978	3979	3979	I	1723	“ Apparently , I ’ve lost my touch , ”
4001	4021	4022	4022	I	1723	“ Eh , I doubt that . You were n’t really into that girl , anyway , were you ? ”
4025	4030	4022	4022	I	1723	“ She was okay . ”
4031	4037	3993	3993	She	46	“ You can do better . ”
4038	4045	4022	4022	I	1723	“ Better is n’t the issue . ”
4046	4052	4022	4022	I	1723	“ What ’s the issue ? ”
4053	4056	3993	3993	She	46	“ Fast . ”
4057	4060	4061	4061	She	46	“ Why ? ”
4064	4076	4061	4061	She	46	“ Are you going to turn into a pumpkin at midnight ? ”
4077	4105	4106	4106	Her	46	“ No , I ’m going to lose Moretti & Sons to my brother Pietro if I do n’t get married before I ’m thirty - five . ”
4110	4113	4106	4106	Her	46	“ Seriously ? ”
4136	4145	4118	4118	I	1723	“ I need another drink . Something stronger . ”
4146	4150	4151	4151	she	46	“ Me too , ”
4302	4305	4306	4306	she	46	“ What ? ”
4322	4332	4317	4317	She	46	“ Why are you looking at me like that ? ”
4333	4347	4348	4348	Her	46	“ I ’m wondering what your parents fed you that stunted your growth . ”
4358	4369	4348	4348	Her	46	“ I am average height , thank you very much . ”
4370	4378	4379	4379	She	46	“ Average for what , a chipmunk ? ”
4391	4418	4379	4379	She	46	“ Always so obsessed with size . What are we to make of that , Dr. Freud ? Is he worried he does n’t measure up ? ”
4419	4438	4439	4439	I	1723	“ Hey , that was you who started the rumor about the size of my — my stuff , ”
4448	4456	4439	4439	I	1723	“ Totally unfounded , I might add . ”
4457	4462	4463	4463	She	46	“ Okay , okay . ”
4474	4485	4463	4463	She	46	“ It ’s time for me to apologize for that . ”
4486	4494	4495	4495	I	1723	“ I ’m not sure I accept , ”
4499	4534	4537	4537	she	46	“ You ca n’t insult a guy ’s manhood like that — without even seeing it — and just expect him to say it ’s no big deal . You besmirched the family jewels . ”
4546	4565	4537	4537	she	46	“ I ’m truly sorry for what I said , and I shall never besmirch your jewels again . ”
4566	4574	4575	4575	She	46	“ Why ’d you do that anyway ? ”
4587	4605	4575	4575	She	46	“ To get back at you for asking every girl to dance but me , of course . ”
4606	4609	4610	4610	I	1723	“ What ? ”
4613	4627	4610	4610	I	1723	“ That ’s ridiculous . You did n’t want to dance with me . ”
4628	4638	4575	4575	She	46	“ How do you know ? You never asked . ”
4639	4656	4657	4657	She	46	“ Bianca , you brought a fucking book with you and read it the entire time . ”
4663	4688	4657	4657	She	46	“ Twilight is n’t just a book to me , Enzo . It ’s a whole world . I still reread it every year . ”
4689	4700	4610	4610	I	1723	“ Twilight ? Is n’t that about a teenage vampire ? ”
4701	4710	4711	4711	I	1723	“ At least that vampire was a gentleman . ”
4716	4751	4711	4711	I	1723	“ Whatever . You refused to even talk to me , and I was bored , so I asked some other girls to dance . I did n’t think it was a big deal . ”
4752	4760	4761	4761	she	46	“ Well , it hurt my feelings , ”
4772	4812	4761	4761	she	46	“ I was already aware you did n’t want to be there — I knew your parents made you take me . And I felt horrible about it , so I copped the bad attitude to hide my humiliation . ”
4813	4844	4711	4711	I	1723	“ Well , I did n’t know any of that , because you never said anything . But I ’m . . . I ’m sorry I hurt your feelings . ”
4845	4851	4852	4852	she	46	“ Your apology is accepted , ”
4855	4864	4711	4711	I	1723	“ Now are you going to accept mine ? ”
4865	4869	4870	4870	I	1723	“ I guess , ”
4884	4895	4877	4877	She	46	“ Thank you . So can we be friends now ? ”
4896	4903	4904	4904	I	1723	“ I suppose we can try , ”
4907	4932	4904	4904	I	1723	“ although I still do n’t understand why you were so stuck - up back then , always too good to talk to me . ”
4933	4947	4948	4948	she	46	“ I was n’t stuck - up , Enzo , I was shy ! ”
4957	5042	4948	4948	she	46	“ And you were always surrounded by girls batting their lashes and tossing their long blond hair and giggling like idiots at everything you said . Just because I was n’t one of them does n’t mean I thought I was too good for you . Frankly , I ’m shocked you even remember me from back then . It ’s not like you ever noticed when I was in the room , what with your ego taking up all the space around you . ”
5043	5054	5055	5055	I	1723	“ Okay , maybe we should leave the past alone , ”
5067	5077	5055	5055	I	1723	“ Clearly , we are always going to disagree . ”
5078	5083	5084	5084	She	280	“ Fine with me . ”
5100	5114	5084	5084	She	280	“ So how ’s your ego tonight ? A little bruised , huh ? ”
5115	5120	5121	5121	I	1723	“ It ’s fine , ”
5131	5150	5121	5121	I	1723	“ Reina obviously was n’t the right choice for a wife . I ’m glad she said no . ”
5159	5164	5151	5151	Bianca	1472	“ Wait a minute . ”
5174	5189	5165	5165	She	1472	“ You proposed to — to — what was the little girl ’s name ? ”
5190	5206	5208	5208	I	1723	“ Reina . And you ’ve got no room to call someone little , Tiny . ”
5222	5242	5243	5243	I	1723	“ We ’re talking about you right now . Did you actually propose tonight ? Like with a ring ? ”
5252	5258	5259	5259	Her	1472	“ Yeah . I did . ”
5264	5270	5259	5259	Her	1472	“ Let me see it . ”
5271	5274	5259	5259	Her	1472	“ No . ”
5275	5279	5259	5259	Her	1472	“ Why not ? ”
5280	5292	5259	5259	Her	1472	“ Because you just want to rub salt in my wound . ”
5293	5336	5337	5337	She	1472	“ For fuck ’s sake , Enzo . You ’re not wounded . You do n’t even love this girl , you just needed to put a ring on her finger so your dad would put your name on the company letterhead . ”
5343	5349	5337	5337	She	1472	“ Now give it here . ”
5383	5388	5389	5389	she	1472	“ It ’s pretty , ”
5408	5415	5396	5396	she	1472	“ Did you have it engraved ? ”
5427	5430	5416	5416	I	1723	“ No . ”
5431	5438	5439	5439	She	1472	“ But it says . . . ”
5461	5469	5457	5457	she	1472	“ ‘ Love Always , Ricky ? ’ ”
5470	5475	5457	5457	she	1472	“ Give me that . ”
5498	5510	5490	5490	she	1472	“ Just a second ! I want to try it on . ”
5560	5567	5540	5540	Bianca	1472	“ So what did you say ? ”
5568	5572	5540	5540	Bianca	1472	“ I proposed . ”
5573	5604	5540	5540	Bianca	1472	“ But how ? Like , did you say , ‘ You ’re the love of my life and I want to be with you forever ’ kind of thing ? ”
5605	5631	5632	5632	I	1723	“ Uh , not exactly . I did n’t want to lie to her . I just , you know , gave her the ring . ”
5643	5651	5632	5632	I	1723	“ But you must have said something . ”
5652	5659	5660	5660	I	1723	“ What difference does it make ? ”
5664	5703	5660	5660	I	1723	“ Look , I ’m only trying to help you . You obviously blew it tonight , and by your own admission , you need to find a Lucy for your Ricky sooner rather than later , right ? ”
5721	5724	5725	5725	Bianca	1472	“ Right ? ”
5736	5743	5725	5725	Bianca	1472	“ So let me help you . ”
5744	5757	5758	5758	I	1723	“ The only way you could help me is to marry me , ”
5765	5780	5758	5758	I	1723	“ And since that ’s out of the question , this discussion is over . ”
5781	5797	5798	5798	I	1723	“ Well , wait a minute . Who said it ’s out of the question ? ”
5808	5811	5803	5803	she	1472	“ Huh ? ”
5822	5856	5812	5812	Bianca	1472	“ I ’m just thinking out loud here . But it seems to me we each have a goal , and they could both be accomplished with one simple — fake — relationship . ”
5873	5889	5890	5890	She	1472	“ I know I ’m drunk , but what the hell are you talking about ? ”
5901	5947	5948	5948	I	1723	“ I ’m talking about the fact that you need a wife to get what you want . I ’m willing to be that wife — temporarily , and under the strictest of conditions — if you ’ll agree to give me what I want . ”
5953	5981	5982	5982	Bianca	1472	“ Oh , no . No fucking way . I see what you ’re doing here . I ’m not paying you to fake being my wife . ”
5987	6008	5982	5982	Bianca	1472	“ Give me a break , Enzo . I do n’t want your money . Nor do I need it . ”
6009	6016	6017	6017	I	1723	“ Then I do n’t understand , ”
6031	6043	5982	5982	Bianca	1472	“ What could you possibly want that I could give you ? ”
6058	6062	5982	5982	Bianca	1472	“ A baby . ”
6074	6078	6064	6064	Bianca	1472	“ A what ? ”
6079	6083	6084	6084	His	283	“ A baby . ”
6092	6096	6084	6084	His	283	“ Whose baby ? ”
6097	6104	6105	6105	I	1723	“ Mine . And . . . ”
6114	6117	6105	6105	I	1723	“ Yours . ”
6118	6126	6127	6127	I	1723	“ I do n’t have a baby . ”
6130	6164	6165	6165	Enzo	256	“ Enzo , I know you ’re somewhat inebriated , but try to keep up . You need a wife . I would like a baby . One and one can make three . ”
6180	6186	6165	6165	Enzo	256	“ This makes no sense . ”
6187	6195	6196	6196	His	283	“ It makes perfect sense , actually . ”
6200	6209	6196	6196	His	283	“ I do n’t want to marry you . ”
6210	6219	6220	6220	I	1723	“ You do n’t want to marry anyone , ”
6224	6227	6220	6220	I	1723	“ True . ”
6228	6260	6261	6261	I	1723	“ At least if you marry me , there ’s an agreed - upon expiration date . We only have to stay married long enough to get you what you want . ”
6267	6276	6261	6261	I	1723	“ And what I want , of course . ”
6277	6291	6220	6220	I	1723	“ That ’s the other thing . What is this about a baby ? ”
6318	6368	6308	6308	He	283	“ Well , the baby is something I ’ve been thinking about for a while . I ’ve always wanted children , but I have n’t met the one yet , and unfortunately for a woman , the biological clock is an actual thing . And mine is ticking . ”
6369	6375	6308	6308	He	283	“ How old are you ? ”
6376	6386	6308	6308	He	283	“ I ’ll be thirty - three next month . ”
6387	6410	6308	6308	He	283	“ That ’s not that old . My mother had my brother Matteo when she was like thirty - eight or something . ”
6411	6423	6308	6308	He	283	“ I ’ve got some additional reproductive health concerns , okay ? ”
6438	6485	6486	6486	He	284	“ Without going into detail , I ’ll just say that it would be better for me to try to get pregnant sooner rather than later . It ’s likely I ’ll struggle to conceive , so putting it off will only be worse for me . ”
6504	6518	6497	6497	his	284	“ So how would that even work ? Would we have to actually — ”
6519	6522	6523	6523	I	1723	“ No ! ”
6539	6560	6523	6523	I	1723	“ It would all be done in a fertility clinic . You ’d donate your . . . you know . ”
6571	6575	6523	6523	I	1723	“ Genetic material . ”
6583	6588	6523	6523	I	1723	“ My genetic material ? ”
6589	6592	6593	6593	My	1723	“ Yes . ”
6610	6647	6598	6598	I	1723	“ The procedure is called an intrauterine insemination . You provide the , um , DNA , it gets washed and concentrated , and then a nurse performs the . . . placement into my uterus . ”
6648	6665	6666	6666	I	1723	“ Oh , like the thing with the turkey baster ? I ’ve heard about that . ”
6683	6689	6598	6598	I	1723	“ Yes , sort of . ”
6690	6698	6699	6699	he	284	“ That does n’t sound very sexy , ”
6719	6728	6729	6729	I	1723	“ It ’s not supposed to be sexy , ”
6733	6738	6729	6729	I	1723	“ It ’s science . ”
6739	6777	6598	6598	I	1723	“ Okay , so what then , you get pregnant with our science baby and then I ’m supposed to divorce you while you ’re pregnant ? No fucking way . I ’ll look like a monster . ”
6778	6791	6792	6792	I	1723	“ We can wait until after it ’s born if you want , ”
6796	6844	6845	6845	Enzo	256	“ I ’m just not sure how long it will take for me to get pregnant . I suppose we could write it into our contract that if I do n’t get pregnant within a certain amount of time , the whole thing is null and void . ”
6855	6870	6845	6845	Enzo	256	“ But if you do get pregnant , I ’m an asshole for leaving . ”
6877	6890	6845	6845	Enzo	256	“ I ’ll take all the blame . I ’ll leave you . ”
6891	6912	6913	6913	he	284	“ But I must have done something to make you leave . I ’m the asshole in all your ideas , ”
6916	6939	6845	6845	Enzo	256	“ No . If we do this , it would have to be an amicable parting . No one gets the blame . ”
6940	6952	6845	6845	Enzo	256	“ Okay , fine . We ’d split up as friends . ”
6953	6962	6963	6963	I	1723	“ We ’re not even friends right now . ”
6969	7004	7005	7005	Enzo	256	“ So we ’ll split up as non - friends ! However you want to end things , Enzo , I ’ll agree to it . As long as I leave with the baby . ”
7010	7031	7005	7005	Enzo	256	“ That ’s the other thing . I ’m supposed to just father this baby and never see it again ? ”
7032	7079	7005	7005	Enzo	256	“ I never said that . You can see him or her whenever you ’d like . I wo n’t move away or anything . I want to live near my family — that ’s why I moved back to Bellamy Creek in the first place . ”
7080	7094	7095	7095	He	287	“ So I ’d be like . . . Weekend Dad or something ? ”
7112	7117	7129	7129	he	287	“ If you want . ”
7134	7151	7129	7129	he	287	“ I do n’t know . It does n’t seem right to do to a kid . ”
7152	7155	7156	7156	I	1723	“ Enzo . ”
7176	7213	7129	7129	he	287	“ I ’ve been thinking about having a baby on my own for a couple years now . I ’ve researched fertility clinics , looked over donor profiles , talked with my family and my therapist . ”
7214	7220	7129	7129	he	287	“ What did they say ? ”
7221	7231	7232	7232	I	1723	“ My therapist understands . My family does not . ”
7238	7376	7377	7377	Enzo	256	“ They ’re totally against it . They can not imagine why I ’d want to get pregnant with a stranger ’s baby or raise a child on my own . But they ’re Catholic and old - fashioned , and they want for me what they had for themselves , and it ’s just not going to happen — not in time for me to have a baby , anyway . I know I could always adopt , and I absolutely would , although I think it ’s more difficult for an unmarried woman to adopt than for a couple . I admit , I have n’t done all the research . Because I really would like to experience being pregnant and giving birth if I can . I know I ’ll be a good mom . ”
7388	7400	7401	7401	I	1723	“ You can not imagine the things people say to me , ”
7418	7422	7414	7414	He	289	“ Like what ? ”
7423	7489	7401	7401	I	1723	“ Like , ‘ At your age , you should lower your standards and just find a man willing to commit . ’ Or ‘ You may have to settle down with a man who already has kids , if you really want them . ’ Or ‘ You ’re a beautiful woman . It ca n’t be that hard to get knocked up . ’ ”
7490	7497	7498	7498	Enzo	256	“ Someone said that to you ? ”
7503	7516	7498	7498	Enzo	256	“ Yes . People say that shit to women all the time . ”
7517	7520	7521	7521	He	289	“ Fuck . ”
7554	7565	7566	7566	I	1723	“ You ’re probably wondering , ‘ Why me ? ’ ”
7586	7590	7570	7570	His	289	“ Not really . ”
7599	7608	7593	7593	I	1723	“ Well , I ’ll tell you anyway . ”
7609	7613	7614	7614	He	289	“ Please do . ”
7625	7709	7710	7710	He	289	“ I know we ’ve had our differences in the past , but we go back a long way , and that means something to me . Our families go back a long way . There ’s trust and loyalty and respect . There ’s a history of . . . of showing up for each other . And I was just thinking , even with our somewhat rocky past , that we ’d show up for each other . Would n’t we ? ”
7723	7736	7710	7710	He	289	“ Nothing means more to me than family . That ’s true . ”
7737	7758	7759	7759	I	1723	“ I think beneath it all , we share the same traditional family values — albeit with some modern adjustments , ”
7762	7797	7798	7798	Enzo	256	“ I do n’t think a woman should have to be married to have a baby , and you do n’t think a man should have to be married to inherit the family business . ”
7804	7834	7798	7798	Enzo	256	“ But I believe in honesty too , and this plan of yours involves lying to our families and friends . And my closest friends are family to me . ”
7835	7857	7858	7858	I	1723	“ I know , and I do n’t love that part of it . But I do like that about you , ”
7862	7921	7858	7858	I	1723	“ the fact that you ’d hesitate before deceiving the people you love . It ’s part of what makes me want you to be the father of my baby , despite your enormously inflated ego . Deep down , like way deep , buried beneath layer upon layer of vanity , pride , and self - absorption — ”
7922	7927	7928	7928	He	292	“ Okay , okay . ”
7935	7938	7939	7939	I	1723	“ Enough . ”
7945	7969	7939	7939	I	1723	“ Deep down , I do believe you are a decent man . Honorable . Trustworthy . Protective of those you care about . ”
7970	7978	7979	7979	he	292	“ Do n’t forget about my face , ”
8000	8004	8005	8005	I	1723	“ Your face ? ”
8029	8045	8046	8046	He	292	“ I suppose it ’s passably attractive . I ’ve never really looked that close . ”
8053	8073	8046	8046	He	292	“ Fine , be that way . I will donate my passable looks to your turkey - baster baby . ”
8074	8078	8079	8079	My	1723	“ You will ? ”
8085	8089	8090	8090	He	292	“ Why not ? ”
8106	8167	8090	8090	He	292	“ I ’m not sure we ’re going to fool anybody , but what the hell ? I ’ve got nothing to lose . I do want to be a dad , and I ’m not getting any younger . And fake - marrying you sounds better than real - marrying anyone else — as long as it ’s temporary . ”
8168	8184	8185	8185	I	1723	“ I suppose that ’s the best proposal I ’m going to get , huh ? ”
8194	8208	8185	8185	I	1723	“ Well , Ricky , I guess you ’ve got yourself a Lucy . ”
8212	8217	8218	8220	My younger sister	293	“ You did what ? ”
8249	8272	8237	8237	She	293	“ I asked Enzo Moretti to be the father of my baby , and in return , I offered to marry him . ”
8273	8280	8281	8281	Ellie	60	“ Bianca , what the hell ? ”
8292	8303	8281	8281	Ellie	60	“ Why would you do that ? It sounds psychotic . ”
8304	8318	8319	8319	I	1723	“ It ’s not psychotic . It ’s very logical , in fact . ”
8333	8356	8319	8319	I	1723	“ It ’s going to get both of us exactly what we want with the added bonus of being a temporary situation . ”
8357	8371	8372	8372	I	1723	“ Temporary ? Uh , last I checked , a baby is forever . ”
8375	8405	8372	8372	I	1723	“ I know the baby is forever , but the marriage wo n’t be . It ’s just a marriage of convenience . Happens all the time in books . ”
8406	8435	8319	8319	I	1723	“ Yeah , but this is n’t a book , Tiny — it ’s real life . What you ’re talking about sounds insane ! A fake wedding ? ”
8436	8439	8440	8440	I	1723	“ Shhhh ! ”
8525	8537	8519	8521	my fertility specialist	300	“ The wedding wo n’t be fake . Just our feelings . ”
8538	8548	8601	8601	She	300	“ So why even bother with a real marriage ? ”
8549	8600	8601	8601	She	300	“ Well , we talked about that , and we agreed that we really do have to get married in order for this to work . His dad has to be convinced it ’s legit . Also , I ’d like it to be legal for the baby ’s sake . ”
8606	8611	8601	8601	She	300	“ This is nuts . ”
8612	8618	8619	8619	Ellie	60	“ But it ’s happening . ”
8741	8753	8754	8754	she	300	“ So what are you going to tell Mom and Dad ? ”
8757	8774	8754	8754	she	300	“ It ’s not like you can pretend you ’ve been dating him all this time . ”
8775	8778	8779	8779	I	1723	“ No , ”
8782	8794	8795	8795	Ellie	60	“ That ’s why I ’m not wearing the ring yet . ”
8803	8811	8795	8795	Ellie	60	“ He already gave you a ring ? ”
8812	8815	8816	8816	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
8821	8865	8866	8866	Ellie	60	“ Things progressed quickly last night . And that ’s what I ’m going to tell the family . We ran into each other at DiFiore ’s after Dad ’s birthday dinner . We talked for hours . We fell madly in love . ”
8871	8878	8866	8866	Ellie	60	“ No one will believe it . ”
8879	8889	8890	8890	I	1723	“ Listen , I need your support on this , ”
8893	8912	8890	8890	I	1723	“ You have to back me up , Ellie — or I agree , it wo n’t work . ”
8913	8916	8866	8866	Ellie	60	“ But — ”
8917	8937	8938	8938	I	1723	“ I was there for you when you came out to Mom and Dad and told them about Sierra , ”
8942	8947	8948	8948	she	300	“ That ’s different , ”
8951	8978	8948	8948	she	300	“ I am actually a lesbian . Sierra and I are genuinely in love . You ’re asking me to back you up in a lie . ”
8979	8984	8985	8985	I	1723	“ Right . Sorry , ”
8991	9001	8985	8985	I	1723	“ I just really want you on my side . ”
9002	9009	9010	9010	She	300	“ I am on your side . ”
9014	9052	9053	9053	I	1723	“ I ’m not sure it ’s the best way to go about having a baby , but if you ’re determined to do it , I ’ll support you . What do I have to do ? ”
9060	9095	9053	9053	I	1723	“ Just be publicly happy for me . Shut down any doubts anyone raises that this is n’t the real thing . Be amazed that it happened and yet totally convinced this is fate . ”
9096	9114	9131	9131	I	1723	“ That ’s a tall order . You could n’t stand Enzo Moretti when you were young . ”
9115	9130	9131	9131	I	1723	“ Honestly , there are some things about him that still drive me nuts , ”
9134	9157	9131	9131	I	1723	“ But I do n’t need to love him for this . In fact , it works better if I do n’t . ”
9158	9164	9206	9206	I	1723	“ What do you mean ? ”
9165	9205	9206	9206	I	1723	“ Because when it ’s time to end it all , I wo n’t be in pieces about it . I ’ll be just fine walking away . And besides , I did n’t really hate him back then , ”
9209	9247	9206	9206	I	1723	“ I just hated the fact that girls were always tripping over themselves to be with him , and he lapped up all the attention like a Golden Retriever . I thought he was obnoxious and conceited . ”
9248	9252	9131	9131	I	1723	“ Fair enough . ”
9253	9262	9263	9263	I	1723	“ And maybe I was a little jealous , ”
9266	9269	9270	9270	She	1723	“ Jealous ? ”
9278	9282	9270	9270	She	1723	“ Of him ? ”
9283	9297	9298	9298	I	1723	“ Kind of . Or maybe I was jealous of those flirty girls . ”
9305	9370	9298	9298	I	1723	“ I was just so shy . I wanted him to pay attention to me , but I did n’t know how to show it . He was just so good - looking and confident . I was tongue - tied around him . So I pretended to hate him . It was easier than admitting I liked him . Know what I mean ? ”
9371	9375	9270	9270	She	1723	“ I guess . ”
9376	9409	9298	9298	I	1723	“ But that ’s all ancient history . We made our peace with each other last night and agreed to leave the past in the past . What matters is the future . ”
9410	9418	9298	9298	I	1723	“ So when are you getting married ? ”
9419	9449	9270	9270	She	1723	“ Not sure yet . We ’re actually having dinner tonight to hammer out the details of the contract . We both have some stipulations we want in writing . ”
9450	9467	9298	9298	I	1723	“ This is so weird . It sounds like a business deal , not an engagement . ”
9468	9500	9298	9298	I	1723	“ That ’s exactly what it is . We ’re clear on the mission , but we ’re going to clarify our vision , define our purpose , discuss the timeline . ”
9501	9506	9507	9507	Ellie	60	“ Oh my God . ”
9521	9531	9513	9513	she	60	“ Romance is really dead , is n’t it ? ”
9532	9541	9542	9542	I	1723	“ I do n’t want romance , Ellie , ”
9548	9630	9542	9542	I	1723	“ Look , I tried for romance . I was with Tate for five solid years before I realized he was never going to marry me — I wasted five years of my life believing his lies and letting him push aside all the serious conversations I tried to have about the future . And now there is n’t anything I would n’t do to get just one of those years back . What if it ’s too late for me ? ”
9631	9638	9639	9639	Ellie	60	“ I ’m sorry , B , ”
9646	9669	9639	9639	Ellie	60	“ I know how hurt you were after Tate . If you ’re determined to do this thing , I support you . ”
9670	9739	9749	9749	she	305	“ I ’m more than determined , Ellie . I want to have a baby , and I ’m done waiting for it . Why should n’t I get to experience being a mom just because I have n’t found real love ? I was willing to use an anonymous donor , but thankfully , I do n’t have to . My child can actually know its father . ”
9740	9748	9749	9749	she	305	“ And Enzo is up for that ? ”
9752	9759	9749	9749	she	305	“ Raising a child with you ? ”
9760	9766	9767	9767	I	1723	“ He said he was . ”
9778	9798	9767	9767	I	1723	“ But he was also drunk . Tonight , I want to have a completely sober conversation about this . ”
9799	9803	9804	9804	She	305	“ Good idea . ”
9810	9820	9821	9821	I	1723	“ What will you do if he says no ? ”
9839	9865	9866	9866	She	305	“ I ’ll move on . That ’s the beauty of this , Ellie . I ’m not giving Enzo Moretti my heart to break . ”
9872	9884	9866	9866	She	305	“ So are you actually going to do it with him ? ”
9885	9903	9904	9904	She	305	“ No ! I ’ll still have an artificial insemination . He ’ll just provide the sperm . ”
9907	9944	9904	9904	She	305	“ Too bad . Seems like if you ’re going to marry a guy as hot as Enzo Moretti , you should at least get a couple perks out of it , like seeing him naked . ”
9945	9955	9956	9956	I	1723	“ I do n’t want to see him naked , ”
10206	10209	10210	10210	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
10213	10218	10219	10219	He	314	“ Come on in . ”
10236	10242	10243	10243	he	314	“ This is for you , ”
10253	10277	10243	10243	he	314	“ It ’s one of my favorites , but do n’t let me have any . My head still hurts from last night . ”
10278	10282	10283	10283	I	1723	“ Thank you . ”
10308	10315	10316	10316	He	314	“ Can I take your coat ? ”
10481	10487	10488	10488	he	314	“ Smells great in here , ”
10505	10511	10488	10488	he	314	“ What are we having ? ”
10512	10524	10525	10525	I	1723	“ Pappardelle with sausage , kale , and spicy tomato sauce . ”
10541	10550	10488	10488	he	314	“ Can I get you something to drink ? ”
10551	10556	10557	10557	I	1723	“ Water ’s fine . ”
10572	10575	10576	10576	He	314	“ Rehydrating ? ”
10585	10639	10576	10576	He	314	“ Yeah . Next time I think it ’s a good idea to drink an entire bottle of Barolo with bourbon for dessert , remind me of the headache I have today . And how I could n’t drive myself home . And how I had to go get my car before church . ”
10640	10653	10654	10654	I	1723	“ You got up for church this morning ? I ’m impressed . ”
10671	10677	10678	10678	He	314	“ Of course I did . ”
10695	10705	10689	10689	he	70	“ Father Mike and I are tight these days . ”
10706	10715	10689	10689	he	70	“ Oh yeah ? And why ’s that ? ”
10716	10780	10781	10781	He	314	“ Because I needed a miracle to avoid getting married , and I figured Father Mike might have an in . Also I wanted God to see me helping my Nonna into the pew , getting on my knees to pray , putting money in the collection basket , admitting I ’m a sinner , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . ”
10806	10837	10792	10792	I	1723	“ I ’m not sure God ’s going to look favorably enough on your et cetera brand of piety to provide a miracle . What would that even look like ? ”
10838	10866	10792	10792	I	1723	“ My dad would change his mind about this stupid settling down bullshit . I could just live my life the way I want to live it . ”
10867	10877	10878	10878	I	1723	“ I thought you said you wanted a family , ”
10890	10919	10878	10878	I	1723	“ I do . But why does he have to put this arbitrary number on it ? Why ca n’t I just do it when I ’m ready ? ”
10920	10926	10792	10792	I	1723	“ It does seem unfair , ”
10931	10961	10792	10792	I	1723	“ But then again , so does the whole biological clock thing . Men can reliably and safely father children long past the age women can easily conceive them . ”
10962	10971	10972	10972	he	324	“ Yeah , that seems like bullshit too , ”
10975	10987	10972	10972	he	324	“ Do you want me to do something to help you ? ”
11000	11004	10972	10972	he	324	“ You cook ? ”
11005	11011	11012	11012	He	324	“ Yes , I cook . ”
11017	11041	11012	11012	He	324	“ I moved out of my parents ’ house when I was eighteen . I would have starved if I could n’t cook . ”
11042	11060	11061	11061	I	1723	“ In that case , can you check the pasta ? I think it ’s probably done . ”
11069	11080	11081	11081	He	324	“ Grab a fork from that drawer to your right . ”
11155	11158	11152	11152	he	324	“ Done . ”
11159	11179	11180	11180	He	324	“ Okay , switch the gas off on that burner , please . And the one under the sauce . ”
11272	11276	11277	11277	I	1723	“ Need help ? ”
11282	11285	11286	11286	He	324	“ Yes . ”
11328	11353	11286	11286	He	324	“ There you go . You should have asked them to put a rolling ladder in here for you . Like at a library . ”
11354	11381	11385	11385	he	324	“ Very funny . If you want to be useful , grab that colander and drain the pasta . Reserve about a cup of the water . ”
11521	11529	11530	11530	he	196	“ You want this in the sauce ? ”
11542	11547	11530	11530	he	196	“ Yes . Thanks . ”
11559	11575	11530	11530	he	196	“ I ’ll take it from here . You can sit down if you want . ”
11576	11579	11580	11580	He	196	“ Okay . ”
11588	11598	11580	11580	He	196	“ Can I pour you a glass of wine ? ”
11599	11604	11605	11605	I	1723	“ Uh , sure . ”
11638	11641	11642	11642	I	1723	“ Opener ? ”
11741	11746	11725	11725	Enzo	256	“ This looks incredible . ”
11747	11757	11725	11725	Enzo	256	“ You do n’t have to sound so surprised . ”
11781	11787	11788	11788	he	196	“ That was a compliment , ”
11793	11822	11788	11788	he	196	“ See , this is the problem with women . You try to say something nice , and they do n’t know how to just say thank you . ”
11823	11831	11832	11832	I	1723	“ I ’ll try to remember that , ”
11878	11881	11882	11882	she	256	“ So , ”
11890	11901	11882	11882	she	256	“ should we wait until after dinner to talk business ? ”
11902	11906	11907	11907	I	1723	“ No need , ”
11920	11951	11952	11952	She	256	“ We can talk now if you ’d like . And if there ’s anything we need to get in writing , we can do it when we ’re finished . ”
11959	11968	11952	11952	She	256	“ So you ’re still up for this ? ”
11969	11976	11977	11977	My	1723	“ I am . Are you ? ”
11988	12015	12016	12016	She	256	“ Yes . I just felt like maybe I should double - check with you , since your decision - making abilities were impaired last night . ”
12026	12042	12016	12016	She	256	“ Well , today I ’m stone cold sober , and I ’m still in . ”
12043	12049	12050	12050	She	256	“ Excellent . So am I. ”
12060	12076	12077	12077	I	1723	“ So the way I see it , there are three phases to this project , ”
12090	12106	12077	12077	I	1723	“ The engagement , the marriage — which includes the baby — and the breakup . ”
12107	12112	12016	12016	She	256	“ Sounds about right . ”
12113	12159	12160	12160	I	1723	“ I do n’t think we should wait on the engagement . It might seem like it ’s coming out of left field , but we should probably fake the whole falling in love thing quickly , and just make the announcement we ’re married . ”
12180	12198	12199	12199	She	256	“ I figure we can do like a City Hall thing and tell them after the fact . ”
12212	12225	12199	12199	She	256	“ So there wo n’t be an actual wedding ? With guests ? ”
12226	12240	12199	12199	She	256	“ I was n’t planning on it . Why ? You want one ? ”
12241	12273	12274	12274	I	1723	“ Not a big one . But what if this is the only chance I ever have to wear a white dress and have my father walk me down the aisle ? ”
12282	12292	12293	12293	She	256	“ Can it be the aisle at City Hall ? ”
12297	12329	12293	12293	She	256	“ I suppose I could deal with that . It might even be better because then we wo n’t have to lie to a priest . I was nervous about that . ”
12330	12333	12334	12334	I	1723	“ Same , ”
12343	12370	12371	12371	She	256	“ I think it ’s best if we keep God out of this . Otherwise , one of us might be struck by lightning or something . ”
12374	12417	12418	12418	I	1723	“ So the story will go that we ran into each other after dinner last night and realized , lo and behold , that we ’ve been wrong about each other all these years , and suddenly we ’re head over heels . ”
12428	12431	12418	12418	I	1723	“ Whatever . ”
12432	12452	12453	12453	She	256	“ Probably we need to date for at least a month before you propose , do n’t you think ? ”
12462	12474	12453	12453	She	256	“ Lest our families think we ’ve completely lost our minds ? ”
12484	12537	12481	12481	I	1723	“ Yeah , you might be right . I do n’t want my dad to pull some bullshit where he says we have to be together for a certain amount of time before he ’ll give me the business . He has to believe we ’re in love and this is real . ”
12543	12557	12558	12558	She	256	“ You sure you ’re going to be able to pull this off ? ”
12563	12567	12568	12568	My	1723	“ Are you ? ”
12572	12599	12600	12600	Her	1723	“ Yes . I ’ll have you know , I ’m a great actor . I played Romeo when I was a senior in high school . ”
12611	12614	12600	12600	Her	1723	“ What ? ”
12615	12676	12677	12677	I	1723	“ I ’m serious . Some girl I liked at the time was all into theater and shit , and she convinced me to try out . I did n’t really think I ’d get the role , but I did . And she was so psyched about it , she gave me a blowjob that very day after school . ”
12680	12691	12692	12692	Bianca	1472	“ So I figured I should actually do the play . ”
12698	12709	12692	12692	Bianca	1472	“ Of course that ’s why you did the play . ”
12710	12716	12717	12717	I	1723	“ I was good too . ”
12731	12740	12741	12741	She	1472	“ Thus with a kiss , I die . ”
12746	12759	12741	12741	She	1472	“ Just when I think you ca n’t be any more ridiculous . ”
12760	12763	12764	12764	I	1723	“ Whatever . ”
12769	12790	12764	12764	I	1723	“ My point is that I know I can be convincing . I hope you ’re up for the challenge . ”
12791	12816	12817	12817	she	1472	“ I will admit that acting wildly in love with you is going to be a challenge , but I will do my best , ”
12826	12834	12835	12835	I	1723	“ Do n’t expect any blowjobs though . ”
12849	12871	12838	12838	Bianca	1472	“ I would n’t dare . So what will be allowed ? We have to give them something . Hand holding ? ”
12872	12875	12838	12838	Bianca	1472	“ Sure . ”
12876	12883	12838	12838	Bianca	1472	“ Can I kiss your cheek ? ”
12884	12888	12889	12889	she	1472	“ I suppose , ”
12905	12917	12838	12838	Bianca	1472	“ Just for show . But no kissing on the lips . ”
12918	12937	12838	12838	Bianca	1472	“ Agreed . But if I put my arm around you , are you going to slap me ? ”
12938	12955	12838	12838	Bianca	1472	“ Just keep your hands where they belong , Enzo , and we ’ll be fine . ”
12956	12961	12962	12962	I	1723	“ Works for me , ”
13027	13033	13034	13034	she	1472	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
13037	13040	13041	13041	I	1723	“ Nothing . ”
13075	13080	13081	13081	she	1472	“ So the marriage , ”
13085	13092	13081	13081	she	1472	“ I ’ve got some rules . ”
13093	13097	13081	13081	she	1472	“ Hit me . ”
13098	13127	13081	13081	she	1472	“ It ’s purely for show . There is no marriage bed . There will be no consummation . Not on the wedding night or any night after . ”
13128	13132	13081	13081	she	1472	“ Party pooper . ”
13133	13143	13081	13081	she	1472	“ And we ’ll do the insemination right away . ”
13144	13160	13081	13081	she	1472	“ No problem . I can not wait to inseminate you from one room away . ”
13161	13196	13197	13197	She	1472	“ And if it does n’t work the first time , I ’d like two more tries . If it does n’t work after three tries , we can move to the divorce phase . ”
13207	13218	13219	13219	Her	1472	“ You do n’t think it ’s going to work ? ”
13223	13241	13219	13219	Her	1472	“ Hard to say . Women who have PCOS like I do have reduced odds of conceiving . ”
13242	13257	13258	13258	I	1723	“ Well , that ’s because they ’ve never tried it with a Moretti . ”
13263	13274	13258	13258	I	1723	“ The men in my family have very strong genes . ”
13275	13281	13282	13282	She	1472	“ Oh , good Lord . ”
13287	13321	13282	13282	She	1472	“ It does n’t have anything to do with your genes , Enzo . It has to do with my eggs . But I do n’t really want to talk about that now . ”
13322	13326	13327	13327	She	1472	“ Suit yourself . ”
13336	13353	13354	13354	I	1723	“ I ’d like to give it three tries . If you ’re okay with it . ”
13357	13371	13354	13354	I	1723	“ I ’m fine with it . I can jerk off three times . ”
13372	13381	13382	13382	She	1472	“ Can you not say it like that ? ”
13387	13404	13382	13382	She	1472	“ That ’s what it is , right ? Why not call a spade a spade ? ”
13405	13420	13354	13354	I	1723	“ I prefer providing a sample . You will provide a sample three times . ”
13421	13429	13430	13430	I	1723	“ If it makes you feel better , ”
13433	13441	13430	13430	I	1723	“ But it ’s exactly the same — ”
13442	13448	13449	13449	she	1472	“ If it does work , ”
13456	13490	13449	13449	she	1472	“ we should probably at least stay married until it ’s born . That means we ’re potentially committing to being married for up to a year or more . Maybe fifteen months . ”
13491	13501	13502	13502	I	1723	“ I was assuming that would be the case , ”
13505	13514	13515	13515	She	1472	“ I think anything less is suspicious anyway . ”
13523	13535	13515	13515	She	1472	“ Should we discuss phase three ? The breakup and divorce ? ”
13536	13545	13449	13449	she	1472	“ Already trying to get rid of me ? ”
13546	13559	13515	13515	She	1472	“ The way I see it , there are two possible scenarios . ”
13560	13568	13515	13515	She	1472	“ Go ahead . What are they ? ”
13569	13585	13586	13586	I	1723	“ First , if I do n’t get pregnant , we can just blame that . ”
13591	13602	13603	13603	She	1472	“ No way . Makes me an asshole , remember ? ”
13608	13679	13603	13603	She	1472	“ I ’ll take the blame . Look , I ca n’t explain this fully , but infertility is really hard on women . It affects them in ways people who ’ve never been there ca n’t understand . But trust me when I say that it could have a detrimental effect on a marriage , especially one that was too rash and ill - advised in the first place . ”
13690	13693	13603	13603	She	1472	“ Okay . ”
13694	13708	13709	13709	I	1723	“ The second scenario is more complicated . If there is a baby . ”
13722	13747	13709	13709	I	1723	“ Yeah , I agree . If I had n’t passed out last night , the thought of it would have kept me up . ”
13748	13775	13709	13709	I	1723	“ This is the most serious part of this , because it ’s the part that ’s real , and the part that ’s actually forever . ”
13776	13779	13780	13780	My	1723	“ Right . ”
13825	13853	13820	13820	Her	1472	“ I want you to take some time to think about this , Enzo . This is n’t like a sperm donor situation . Because of our ‘ marriage’”—she
13860	13922	13820	13820	Her	1472	again—“people will know you ’re the baby ’s father . Like I said before , I wo n’t ask anything of you , but if you want to co - parent with me , you can . We could work out custody and visitation arrangements . On the flip side , if you want to walk away completely , you can . ”
13935	13971	13930	13930	I	1723	“ Fuck that . I ’m not an asshole , Bianca . If I father a child , I ’ll be its father . I ’m not a man who walks away from my responsibilities . ”
13972	13975	13930	13930	I	1723	“ Okay . ”
13976	13988	13989	13989	I	1723	“ And I told you . I ’ve always wanted kids , ”
14001	14045	13989	13989	I	1723	“ I get that , but I just want you to take some time to think about whether or not you ’re ready for one at this point in your life , and with these circumstances . You will be a single dad . ”
14054	14071	14046	14046	I	1723	“ I know . I said I was up for this , and I meant it . ”
14150	14168	14169	14169	Bianca	1472	“ Okay . So this is the last thing I ’m going to say on this topic . ”
14174	14198	14169	14169	Bianca	1472	“ I know you want to run your own company . But are you sure this is the only way to get it ? ”
14199	14214	14169	14169	Bianca	1472	“ Of course I ’m sure . That ’s what I ’ve been saying . ”
14215	14230	14231	14231	My	1723	“ What about starting your own company ? Not taking over your father ’s . ”
14235	14289	14231	14231	My	1723	“ Starting over from scratch ? Fuck that . This is my birthright , Bianca . I ’m the oldest Moretti son , and I deserve this , just like the previous five generations of oldest sons . I ’m just as worthy as the rest of them . I can prove it . ”
14290	14295	14296	14296	she	1723	“ I believe you , ”
14308	14316	14296	14296	she	1723	“ Good . Then it ’s settled . ”
14483	14487	14488	14488	she	1472	“ Quit it , ”
14497	14504	14488	14488	she	1472	“ You ’re creeping me out . ”
14505	14508	14488	14488	she	1472	“ Sorry . ”
14540	14545	14546	14546	she	1472	“ Want some coffee ? ”
14554	14557	14546	14546	she	1472	“ Sure . ”
14569	14574	14575	14575	she	1472	“ I ’m impressed , ”
14590	14594	14575	14575	she	1472	“ Thank you . ”
14595	14607	14608	14608	I	1723	“ I meant with your mother . You have nice manners . ”
14623	14645	14646	14646	We	347	“ Yeah , well , when she was n’t busy screaming at my father , she managed to raise polite kids . ”
14665	14674	14675	14675	she	1472	“ You want to take some pasta home ? ”
14678	14687	14688	14688	She	1472	“ Are you kidding ? Yes , please . ”
14708	14723	14688	14688	She	1472	“ Do n’t forget to take it . It ’ll be in the fridge . ”
14724	14737	14688	14688	She	1472	“ Okay . Thanks . Hey , can I use your bathroom ? ”
14738	14748	14688	14688	She	1472	“ Sure . Around the corner on your right . ”
14997	15002	14982	14982	I	1723	“ You get lost ? ”
15012	15028	15003	15003	I	1723	“ Just snooping in your office . Making sure you ’re not a secret psychopath . ”
15029	15048	15051	15051	I	1723	“ I do n’t keep the bodies in my office , Enzo . Give me a little credit . ”
15060	15067	15051	15051	I	1723	“ You like traveling , huh ? ”
15068	15082	15003	15003	I	1723	“ Love it . It ’s where I get all my design inspiration . ”
15083	15099	15051	15051	I	1723	“ What ’s your favorite place ? I should probably know this stuff about you . ”
15100	15104	15105	15105	She	1472	“ Good point . ”
15131	15148	15149	15149	I	1723	“ I ’d say Florence . No , the Amalfi Coast . No , maybe Capri . ”
15152	15163	15164	15164	She	1472	“ I like a woman who gives a straight answer . ”
15169	15183	15164	15164	She	1472	“ At least they ’re all in one country . What about you ? ”
15184	15201	15116	15116	She	1472	“ I like Italy too . I ’d say Rome or Florence , for the architecture . ”
15202	15229	15164	15164	She	1472	“ What do you know , we agree on something . If we were going on a real honeymoon , we could have gone to Italy . ”
15230	15235	15236	15236	I	1723	“ Who ’s that ? ”
15257	15284	15287	15288	the couple	355	“ Oh , those are Grandma Vinnie ’s parents — my great - grandparents . Their last name was Lupo . They were married in 1923 . ”
15290	15304	15287	15288	the couple	355	“ So that ’s your great - grandmother ? You look like her . ”
15305	15330	15331	15331	I	1723	“ You ’re just saying that because she ’s short . Everyone called her Tiny too . That ’s where my nickname comes from . ”
15334	15356	15357	15357	Bianca	1472	“ It ’s not just because she ’s short . It ’s her face too . The heart shape of it . ”
15377	15384	15385	15385	Bianca	1472	“ She had red hair too , ”
15388	15432	15385	15385	Bianca	1472	“ I mean , she died when I was only three , so I do n’t remember her , and her hair was white by then anyway , but I ’ve heard stories about her . Apparently , she was a real pistol . ”
15433	15437	15438	15438	I	1723	“ Oh yeah ? ”
15451	15463	15464	15464	She	1472	“ Your namesake was a pistol ? There ’s a surprise . ”
15472	15480	15464	15464	She	1472	“ Do you know any family history ? ”
15481	15485	15486	15486	I	1723	“ Very little , ”
15489	15520	15486	15486	I	1723	“ I should ask my parents about it . Apparently my great - grandfather , the one I ’m named for , was into some sinister business . Mobster stuff . ”
15521	15535	15536	15536	Bianca	1472	“ That ’s funny , because mine was too . They both were , ”
15546	15557	15536	15536	Bianca	1472	“ They ran whisky into Detroit from Canada during Prohibition . ”
15558	15561	15562	15562	I	1723	“ Seriously ? ”
15588	15609	15610	15610	Bianca	1472	“ That ’s pretty cool . My great - grandfather lived in Detroit too . Maybe they knew each other . ”
15613	15637	15610	15610	Bianca	1472	“ Would n’t that be something ? Come on , let ’s have coffee and dessert . I ’ve got a sweet tooth . ”
15638	15643	15644	15644	I	1723	“ Good to know , ”
15674	15679	15680	15680	I	1723	“ What ’s that ? ”
15712	15745	15746	15746	She	1632	“ That ’s for us to draw up the most important rules of our deal . I figure we do n’t need everything in writing , maybe just the top five things . ”
15758	15767	15768	15768	she	1632	“ I ’ll go first . No sex , ”
15793	15796	15788	15788	I	1723	“ Fine . ”
15797	15801	15802	15802	she	1632	“ With anyone , ”
15813	15836	15802	15802	she	1632	“ Not as long as we ’re married . I do n’t want it going around that you ’re cheating on me . ”
15837	15853	15788	15788	I	1723	“ Well , I do n’t want it going around that I ’m a cheater . ”
15854	15861	15862	15862	she	1632	“ Good , then we agree , ”
15906	15912	15901	15901	I	1723	“ Did you make these ? ”
15913	15916	15802	15802	she	1632	“ Yes . ”
15917	15922	15788	15788	I	1723	“ They ’re good . ”
15923	15935	15936	15936	I	1723	“ Thank you . Okay , what ’s your top rule ? ”
15946	15952	15936	15936	I	1723	“ Do n’t nag me . ”
15953	15956	15901	15901	I	1723	“ What ? ”
15957	16006	16007	16007	I	1723	“ My mother is always on my dad about every little thing — he got the floor dirty , he left the seat up , he forgot their anniversary , he did n’t make the dinner reservation , the volume on the TV is too loud . . . ”
16012	16022	16007	16007	I	1723	“ It ’s like a constant stream of criticism . ”
16023	16030	16031	16031	she	1723	“ Fair enough . No nagging , ”
16035	16042	16043	16043	I	1723	“ Add something else to that , ”
16055	16115	16116	16116	She	1723	“ Add that if something is really bothering you , you ’re going to tell me what it is and not expect me to guess at it like a mind reader . Like , you wo n’t go into a room and slam the door and make me wonder what I did wrong or what you ’re upset about . ”
16127	16138	16116	16116	She	1723	“ Item two A , no mind - reading expectations . ”
16139	16146	16147	16147	I	1723	“ Okay , what ’s next ? ”
16167	16182	16161	16161	Bianca	1472	“ We have to be able to trust each other . So no lying . ”
16183	16195	16196	16196	I	1723	“ Agreed . And no giving away the secret to anyone , ”
16200	16209	16210	16210	She	1723	“ No one else can know about this . ”
16214	16220	16210	16210	She	1723	“ I told my sister . ”
16221	16225	16161	16161	Bianca	1472	“ You what ! ”
16226	16240	16241	16241	she	1723	“ I told my sister , Ellie . But we can trust her , ”
16245	16284	16241	16241	she	1723	“ Look , we ’re going to need support from people close to us . And I felt like Ellie was going to see through it anyway . Pick one friend or one of your siblings to tell . ”
16372	16381	16382	16382	I	1723	“ I ca n’t choose between my friends , ”
16385	16392	16382	16382	I	1723	“ How many are we talking ? ”
16393	16396	16397	16397	She	1723	“ Three . ”
16400	16413	16397	16397	She	1723	“ That ’s too many . Put their names in a hat . ”
16414	16417	16382	16382	I	1723	“ Seriously ? ”
16418	16421	16422	16422	She	1723	“ Yes . ”
16431	16436	16422	16422	She	1723	“ Who are they ? ”
16466	16474	16475	16475	she	1723	“ Close your eyes and pick one , ”
16546	16554	16555	16555	she	1723	“ Well ? What does it say ? ”
16558	16561	16562	16562	She	1723	“ Cole . ”
16565	16572	16562	16562	She	1723	“ That ’s a great choice . ”
16573	16584	16562	16562	She	1723	“ I ’m not sure . Cole sucks at lying . ”
16585	16604	16562	16562	She	1723	“ We ’re not exactly asking him to lie . We ’re just trusting him with a secret . ”
16605	16609	16562	16562	She	1723	“ I guess . ”
16624	16647	16618	16618	she	1723	“ Number three : No lying to each other . Number four : No telling anyone except Ellie DeRossi and Cole Mitchell . ”
16648	16651	16562	16562	She	1723	“ Fine . ”
16652	16674	16675	16675	I	1723	“ Wait — what about their significant others ? Are we going to expect them not to tell Cheyenne or Sierra ? ”
16678	16704	16675	16675	I	1723	“ I guess not . But that ’s it . The more people who know , the more likely it is the secret gets out . ”
16705	16708	16709	16709	Bianca	1472	“ Agreed . ”
16718	16752	16753	16753	I	1723	“ We need one more . We have no sex , no nagging or mind reading , no lying , no telling anyone outside the circle of trust . What can we add ? ”
16766	16774	16775	16775	I	1723	“ No falling in love with me , ”
16789	16792	16785	16785	Her	1472	“ What ? ”
16793	16798	16799	16799	Our	368	“ You heard me . ”
16814	16826	16785	16785	Her	1472	“ Wait a minute . That ’s a joke , right ? ”
16827	16860	16785	16785	Her	1472	“ I ’m totally serious , Bianca . The one thing that could ruin this entire operation is if you get all hormonal and emotional , and you develop feelings for me . ”
16861	16864	16865	16865	she	1472	“ Ha ! ”
16872	16876	16865	16865	she	1472	“ Fat chance ! ”
16877	16883	16884	16884	I	1723	“ Then write it down , ”
16895	16914	16915	16915	She	1472	“ Oh , yes , of course . Let me get this down quickly , before I forget . ”
16921	16966	16915	16915	She	1472	“ Special rule for Bianca : No falling in love with Enzo Moretti , and if you forget for one moment what a cocky , arrogant , egotistical , presumptuous , swaggering ass he is , just come back and look at this list . ”
16967	16973	16974	16974	I	1723	“ Erase that last part , ”
16977	16981	16982	16982	she	1472	“ No way , ”
16990	17070	16982	16982	she	1472	“ Look , the only reason I want that in there is because I ’ve been in this situation before , okay ? Where I think a woman and I are on the exact same page , just hanging out and having fun , and then she suddenly gets feelings for me , and the fun is over . She starts expecting me to be someone else , and then I ’m an asshole when I do n’t change . ”
17071	17074	17075	17075	Bianca	1472	“ Enzo , ”
17089	17111	17075	17075	Bianca	1472	“ I promise , I know exactly who you are . And I will never expect you to be anybody else . ”
17150	17160	17139	17139	Cole	81	“ Wait a minute . What did you say ? ”
17161	17170	17171	17171	We	369	“ I ’m going to marry Bianca DeRossi . ”
17199	17202	17189	17189	I	1723	“ When ? ”
17203	17218	17219	17219	He	16	“ Maybe a month or so . We do n’t want to rush it . ”
17242	17245	17189	17189	I	1723	“ Why ? ”
17246	17274	17189	17189	I	1723	“ So that my dad will give me Moretti & Sons . You know the condition — married and settled by age thirty - five or else . ”
17275	17283	17284	17284	Cole	81	“ I know , but . . . ”
17289	17304	17284	17284	Cole	81	“ Marrying Bianca ? That ’s fucking nuts . You ca n’t stand her . ”
17305	17322	17323	17323	I	1723	“ It ’s only temporary . And besides , she ’s growing on me — slightly , ”
17352	17359	17333	17333	Cole	81	“ Temporary ? Like how long ? ”
17360	17381	17382	17382	Cole	81	“ Not that long . Maybe a year or so . Just long enough for the baby to be born . ”
17392	17395	17396	17396	I	1723	“ Baby ! ”
17399	17420	17421	17421	He	16	“ Yeah . Bianca wants a baby . I need a wife . The pieces just sort of fit together . ”
17428	17439	17421	17421	He	16	“ I feel like I ’m in the Twilight Zone . ”
17440	17472	17421	17421	He	16	“ Look , we ’ve worked it all out . It ’s more of a business deal than anything else . We have a mission , a purpose , a plan . ”
17473	17508	17421	17421	He	16	“ Um , that plan includes the creation of another human being . Do you know what you ’re getting into ? And if you guys split , you ’ll still be a father . ”
17509	17513	17421	17421	He	16	“ I know . ”
17514	17524	17525	17525	Cole	81	“ A single father . It ’s not easy . ”
17613	17617	17618	17618	I	1723	“ I know , ”
17621	17678	17618	17618	I	1723	“ We ’ve talked about all this . And I ’ve thought about it . I think being a single dad sounds awesome . You get all of the perks of being a father without having to deal with a wife driving you nuts . You can do everything your way without any interference or arguing . ”
17679	17684	17685	17685	Cole	81	“ Or any help , ”
17692	17724	17685	17685	Cole	81	“ I ’ve got a mother and sisters if I need help . And there might not be a baby anyway . Bianca is n’t sure she can even get pregnant . ”
17725	17729	17618	17618	I	1723	“ Why not ? ”
17730	17742	17743	17743	I	1723	“ She ’s got some kind of problem with her eggs , ”
17763	17819	17758	17758	she	81	“ And it ’s only getting worse , so she wants to try getting pregnant sooner rather than later . She was going to use a sperm donor , but she said her family was totally against the idea and she did n’t love the thought of a total stranger being her baby ’s father . ”
17820	17829	17832	17832	Cole	81	“ But she loves the thought of you ? ”
17837	17863	17832	17832	Cole	81	“ This is just so weird . You guys do nothing but bicker and poke at each other when you ’re in the same room . ”
17864	17871	17872	17872	I	1723	“ We ’re working on that , ”
17882	17897	17872	17872	I	1723	“ And she apologized for the thing she said about my dick being small . ”
17898	17909	17910	17910	Cole	81	“ Well , I guess that ’s all that matters , ”
17915	17975	17976	17976	Cole	81	“ Listen , I know it sounds a little extreme , but she and I are in agreement on this . We each have a goal , and we ’re helping each other reach those goals . And when it ’s done , we ’ll part as friends and work out the arrangements for co - parenting the baby . ”
17982	17993	17994	17994	I	1723	“ What we need from our friends is unconditional support , ”
18008	18033	18002	18002	I	1723	“ We understand that this is n’t the way most people would go about getting what they want , but maybe most people are n’t as”—I
18037	18071	17994	17994	I	1723	word—“as brave as we are . As determined . As willing to do whatever it takes to get where we want to be . We ’re not getting any younger , you know . ”
18072	18076	18077	18077	he	377	“ I know , ”
18080	18104	18105	18105	Cole	81	“ And good for you and for Griffin that you found the real thing with someone , but Bianca and I have n’t . ”
18110	18116	18105	18105	Cole	81	“ Have you even tried ? ”
18117	18124	18125	18125	I	1723	“ That ’s not the point , ”
18135	18158	18125	18125	I	1723	“ The point is that this is what we ’re doing , and we need our friends and family to support us . ”
18159	18170	18171	18171	He	377	“ You ’re going to tell your family the truth ? ”
18177	18203	18204	18204	Cole	81	“ Hell no ! The only people who will know the truth are Bianca ’s sister Ellie and you . That ’s in the contract . ”
18207	18233	18204	18204	Cole	81	“ Fuck , Moretti . You know I ’m shit at lying . My lip does that weird thing , and I get all sweaty . ”
18234	18242	18243	18243	I	1723	“ You wo n’t have to lie , ”
18251	18266	18243	18243	I	1723	“ You just have to keep a secret . And be excited for me . ”
18267	18275	18276	18276	he	377	“ I can manage that . Actually , ”
18287	18293	18276	18276	he	377	“ I might enjoy this . ”
18294	18297	18243	18243	I	1723	“ Why ? ”
18298	18301	18302	18302	he	377	“ Because , ”
18308	18324	18302	18302	he	377	“ I know you . And her . She ’s going to drive you crazy . ”
18352	18356	18363	18363	Enzo	256	“ You ready ? ”
18357	18362	18363	18363	Enzo	256	“ I think so . ”
18368	18381	18363	18363	Enzo	256	“ Do n’t be nervous . We ’re totally prepared for this . ”
18382	18386	18387	18387	We	378	“ Are we ? ”
18517	18552	18511	18511	Enzo	256	“ We are , Enzo . As far as our families know , we ’ve been dating for over a month . We spend all our time together . We ca n’t get enough . ”
18663	18666	18667	18667	he	389	“ Right , ”
18670	18676	18667	18667	he	389	“ Ca n’t get enough . ”
18677	18684	18685	18685	I	1723	“ What ’s my middle name ? ”
18688	18695	18685	18685	I	1723	“ Jane . What ’s mine ? ”
18696	18706	18667	18667	he	389	“ Thomas . Where did I go to college ? ”
18707	18719	18685	18685	I	1723	“ Columbia . How long have I worked for my dad ? ”
18720	18735	18685	18685	I	1723	“ Since you were fourteen . What instrument did I play in high school ? ”
18736	18750	18751	18751	I	1723	“ Violin . What position do I play on the Bellamy Creek Bulldogs ? ”
18754	18772	18751	18751	I	1723	“ Oh , yes . Ca n’t forget old man baseball . You ’re the second baseman . ”
18773	18779	18780	18780	he	389	“ And the fastest runner , ”
18783	18811	18812	18812	He	389	“ I stole home in the championship game against the Mason City Mavericks last year , which gave us the lead . We won by one run . ”
18831	18837	18838	18838	I	1723	“ You are very fast , ”
18845	18851	18852	18852	I	1723	“ Okay , what else ? ”
18858	18929	18852	18852	I	1723	“ Your favorite food is a meatball sandwich , your favorite city is Rome , your favorite color is blue . You ’re good at math , you like books about architecture , you have an excellent memory . You speak some Italian , which I love . You like to bring me flowers , and I like cooking for you . You snore , but I do n’t mind . ”
18930	18936	18937	18937	Enzo	256	“ I do n’t snore ! ”
18943	18960	18937	18937	Enzo	256	“ And how would you know , anyway ? We ’ve never spent the night together . ”
18961	18974	18975	18975	I	1723	“ Because we ’ve also discovered our shared old - fashioned values , ”
18979	18989	18990	18990	He	391	“ We do n’t believe in sex before marriage . ”
18995	19009	18990	18990	He	391	“ We ’re not going to say that out loud , are we ? ”
19010	19019	19020	19020	I	1723	“ No . It will just be implied . ”
19024	19036	19037	19037	He	391	“ Now you go . What do you know about me ? ”
19050	19128	19037	19037	He	391	“ You have a sweet tooth and you sometimes eat cookies for breakfast — not that I ’ve seen you do it , of course . You ’re near - sighted , and without your glasses , you ’re blind as a bat . Your favorite flowers are white roses . Your great - grandparents were bootleggers . You love traveling , especially to Italy . You moved home from Chicago to be closer to your family . ”
19129	19134	19135	19135	I	1723	“ That ’s good , ”
19138	19167	19135	19135	I	1723	“ Work that in for sure . The importance of family is another belief we have in common . Also wanting to raise a family in Bellamy Creek . ”
19168	19171	19037	19037	He	391	“ Right . ”
19172	19182	19183	19183	He	392	“ Now what ’s something you love about me ? ”
19188	19193	19183	19183	He	392	“ Umm . . . ”
19194	19197	19198	19198	I	1723	“ Enzo ! ”
19203	19208	19198	19198	I	1723	“ I ’m thinking ! ”
19209	19225	19183	19183	He	392	“ Well , you need to think faster . We have to get in there . ”
19226	19229	19230	19230	He	392	“ Okay . ”
19235	19239	19230	19230	He	392	“ Your cooking . ”
19240	19243	19198	19198	I	1723	“ And ? ”
19244	19267	19198	19198	I	1723	“ You ’re good at your job . You work hard . I like that you started your own little design company . ”
19268	19280	19285	19285	he	392	“ Do n’t say it like that — it ’s patronizing . ”
19281	19284	19285	19285	he	392	“ Fine , ”
19291	19321	19285	19285	he	392	“ But I do n’t get what the big deal is . It ’s a design company . It ’s little . You only have one employee — yourself . ”
19322	19340	19341	19341	He	392	“ Never mind . Okay , what else ? There has to be a more personal thing . ”
19346	19358	19341	19341	He	392	“ No nagging , remember ? It ’s in the contract . ”
19359	19387	19285	19285	he	392	“ We ’re not married yet , and we wo n’t be if you ca n’t get this right . I get to nag for a moment . ”
19388	19394	19395	19395	He	392	“ Okay . More personal . ”
19401	19419	19420	19420	I	1723	“ I like the way your butt looks in those jeans with the rip in the knee . ”
19431	19437	19420	19420	I	1723	“ Less pervy , please . ”
19438	19455	19420	19420	I	1723	“ It makes me laugh when you ’re too short to reach your high kitchen cabinets ? ”
19456	19462	19463	19463	I	1723	“ Oh , forget it . ”
19468	19479	19480	19480	He	392	“ No , wait ! I can think of one . ”
19485	19495	19480	19480	He	392	“ You ’ve got what my dad calls moxie . ”
19496	19499	19420	19420	I	1723	“ Moxie ? ”
19500	19522	19480	19480	He	392	“ Yeah . It means courage . Determination . You can handle what comes at you and land on your feet . ”
19530	19544	19480	19480	He	392	“ Thank you , I ’ll take it . Let ’s go in . ”
19545	19557	19558	19558	He	392	“ I ’ll get the door for you . Stay there . ”
19572	19576	19577	19577	I	1723	“ Sweet pea . ”
19582	19593	19594	19594	He	392	“ Sweet pea ? I do n’t know about that . ”
19605	19609	19610	19610	he	392	“ Sugar pie ? ”
19624	19629	19610	19610	he	392	“ Ew . No . ”
19630	19633	19610	19610	he	392	“ Dollface ? ”
19634	19643	19610	19610	he	392	“ What is this , nineteen - twenty ? ”
19644	19656	19657	19657	He	392	“ Come on , I need to call you something cute . ”
19666	19672	19657	19657	He	392	“ I ’ve got it . ”
19673	19676	19610	19610	he	392	“ What ? ”
19677	19685	19686	19686	My	1723	“ I ’ll call you mia polpetta . ”
19690	19706	19707	19707	I	1723	“ Italian ! That ’s good , I like it . What does it mean ? ”
19747	19761	19732	19732	Enzo	256	“ My little meatball . Now smile , polpetta , we ’re on . ”
19838	19840	19836	19836	Ellie	60	“ notice ”
19965	19979	19980	19980	Ellie	60	“ Oh my God — Bianca , what is that on your finger ? ”
20031	20033	20026	20026	Enzo	256	“ adoring ”
20047	20062	20064	20064	we	397	attempts—“You look like you have a trapped fart , can you try a little harder please?”—we
20070	20073	20074	20074	I	1723	“ That , ”
20094	20100	20074	20074	I	1723	“ is my engagement ring . ”
20168	20171	20165	20165	Ricky	51	“ Seriously ? ”
20190	20193	20195	20195	Sierra	64	“ Congratulations , ”
20197	20205	20206	20206	Pietro	1062	“ Wait . You ’re getting married ? ”
20209	20212	20213	20213	Enzo	256	“ Yes , ”
20227	20230	20231	20231	Ellie	60	“ When ? ”
20238	20243	20231	20231	Ellie	60	“ Soon , actually . ”
20266	20274	20259	20259	We	407	too—“What do you think ? Chair or actual shoulder?”—and
20321	20337	20301	20301	he	1062	“ We already applied for a license . So hopefully within a week or two . ”
20338	20341	20342	20343	My mother	256	“ What ? ”
20352	20376	20342	20343	My mother	256	“ You ca n’t get married in a week or two . That ’s not enough time to send out all the invitations . ”
20377	20386	20387	20387	I	1723	“ We want a small wedding , Mom , ”
20390	20400	20387	20387	I	1723	“ Just us and two witnesses at City Hall . ”
20427	20431	20432	20433	Mrs. Moretti	256	“ City Hall ! ”
20446	20453	20438	20438	she	256	“ But you ’re both Catholic ! ”
20454	20470	20472	20472	Enzo	256	“ We know , Ma , but we ’d just prefer to keep it simple , ”
20474	20477	20478	20478	I	1723	“ Intimate , ”
20481	20490	20478	20478	I	1723	“ You mean we ca n’t even come ? ”
20500	20508	20510	20510	Enzo	256	“ You can come if you want , ”
20512	20534	20510	20510	Enzo	256	“ But we ’re keeping the ceremony very small . We ’ll have a party afterward that everyone can come to . ”
20535	20541	20542	20542	Enzo	256	“ Is this for real ? ”
20548	20561	20545	20545	Talia	90	“ Have n’t you guys only been dating for like a month ? ”
20590	20593	20594	20594	she	256	“ Ow ! ”
20597	20600	20594	20594	she	256	“ Ma ! ”
20601	20607	20608	20609	her mother	256	“ Hush up , Talia ! ”
20612	20628	20629	20629	Her	256	“ When you know , you know . It ’s about time Enzo settled down . ”
20634	20651	20629	20629	Her	256	“ And I always had a feeling about them , from the time they were younger . ”
20652	20659	20660	20661	my mother	256	“ I did too , Marisol , ”
20664	20671	20672	20673	my brother	415	“ Can I have your condo ? ”
20687	20691	20692	20692	he	415	“ A toast , ”
20700	20717	20692	20692	he	415	“ To the happy future of Bianca and Enzo , and the union of our families ! ”
20815	20821	20822	20822	he	44	“ To Bianca and Enzo , ”
20831	20835	20822	20822	he	44	“ Per cent'anni . ”
20932	20944	20946	20946	Cat	256	“ Mom , what happened to no phones at the table ? ”
20953	20963	20964	20965	her mother	256	“ I ’ll put it away in a minute , ”
20969	20978	20979	20979	Enzo	256	“ I just need to message the priest . ”
20983	20986	20979	20979	Enzo	256	“ What ? ”
20987	21013	21014	21014	Enzo	256	“ I ’m texting Father Mike . Just because you ’re getting married at City Hall does n’t mean he ca n’t bless your marriage . ”
21022	21031	21014	21014	Enzo	256	“ That ’s a wonderful idea , Marisol , ”
21045	21058	21059	21059	I	1723	“ We do n’t really want anything too , um , involved , ”
21066	21072	21073	21073	He	422	“ Do we , babe ? ”
21078	21082	21073	21073	He	422	“ Definitely not . ”
21083	21093	21094	21094	Pietro	1062	“ You really do n’t want a big wedding ? ”
21104	21119	21097	21097	Lynne	87	“ We had like three hundred people at ours . It was super fun . ”
21120	21126	21127	21127	I	1723	“ We really do n’t . ”
21140	21148	21097	21097	Lynne	87	“ We just want to be married . ”
21149	21155	21156	21157	My mother	256	“ Is n’t that sweet ? ”
21163	21183	21156	21157	My mother	256	“ They ’re so in love , they just want to be husband and wife as soon as possible . ”
21184	21189	21193	21193	JJ	1463	“ Why the rush ? ”
21195	21202	21193	21193	JJ	1463	“ You knocked up or something ? ”
21203	21215	21216	21217	My mother	256	“ John Patrick DeRossi , what is the matter with you ? ”
21221	21227	21228	21228	I	1723	“ I ’m not pregnant , ”
21235	21243	21228	21228	I	1723	“ But you want children , right ? ”
21258	21264	21244	21245	Mrs. Moretti	256	“ Yes . We do . ”
21282	21307	21308	21309	Mrs. Moretti	256	“ I think I ’m going to cry . It ’s like all my prayers are being answered in the space of ten minutes . ”
21321	21325	21326	21326	she	256	“ Thank you , ”
21329	21380	21326	21326	she	256	“ Anyway , Ma , we really do n’t want a priest . I ’m already in touch with Judge Reinhart — we did a kitchen reno for him and his wife last year — and I ’m just waiting for him to get back to me with a date . ”
21381	21385	21386	21387	Mr. Moretti	44	“ James Reinhart ? ”
21390	21422	21423	21423	Enzo	256	“ I ’ll call him tomorrow . We gave him a great deal on that home renovation , and he said if I ever needed anything to give him a call . ”
21427	21441	21423	21423	Enzo	256	“ Pop , we ’ve got this . You do n’t need to — ”
21442	21447	21448	21449	Mr. Moretti	44	“ Consider it done , ”
21454	21470	21471	21471	Enzo	256	“ I ’ll get that wedding date for you by the end of the week . ”
21503	21514	21492	21492	I	1723	“ Thanks , Mr. Moretti . We ’d appreciate that . ”
21515	21524	21528	21528	Eve	89	“ So Enzo , how did you propose ? ”
21544	21550	21551	21551	I	1723	“ It was very romantic , ”
21573	21582	21559	21559	I	1723	“ He even got down on one knee . ”
21583	21588	21590	21590	Cat	256	“ Where were you ? ”
21592	21597	21598	21598	I	1723	“ At my condo , ”
21601	21606	21607	21607	Lynne	87	“ Were you surprised ? ”
21610	21615	21616	21616	Enzo	256	“ She was shocked . ”
21630	21650	21622	21622	he	427	“ Shocked and delighted . She could n’t say yes fast enough . And she cried tears of joy . ”
21694	21701	21702	21702	I	1723	“ It was quite the surprise , ”
21708	21715	21716	21716	Talia	90	“ I ’m sure it was , ”
21721	21736	21716	21716	Talia	90	“ Whoever thought Enzo would be the type to get down on one knee ? ”
21737	21743	21744	21744	I	1723	“ Both knees , actually , ”
21755	21797	21798	21798	Enzo	256	“ Almost like he was begging me to spend the rest of our lives together . He just kept saying over and over again how much he loved me . How he ca n’t wait for me to be his wife . ”
21806	21816	21817	21817	he	431	“ You ’re just so lovable , mia polpetta , ”
21830	21846	21817	21817	he	431	“ Once I got past your prickly surface , I discovered a truly big heart . ”
21847	21871	21872	21872	I	1723	“ And once I realized there was more to you than your big fat ego , I could n’t help falling in love . ”
21878	21892	21872	21872	I	1723	“ In fact , I find your insufferable arrogance sort of charming now . ”
21893	21915	21916	21916	he	431	“ And I find your know - it - all attitude and general air of imperious self - importance downright entrancing , ”
21932	21948	21953	21953	Ellie	60	“ I am so bewitched by you , sweetheart , I can hardly see straight . ”
21958	21968	21953	21953	Ellie	60	“ Wow . Clearly you were meant to be . ”
21969	21972	21973	21973	I	1723	“ Clearly , ”
22090	22099	22100	22100	My	1723	“ Aww , now is n’t that sweet ? ”
22110	22125	22100	22100	My	1723	“ You two are going to be together forever . I just know it . ”
22147	22154	22155	22155	she	0	“ Ladies ’ room , please , ”
22163	22172	22173	22173	I	1723	“ I ’ll be right back , honey , ”
22216	22218	22195	22195	He	431	“ relationship ”
22259	22284	22250	22250	she	0	“ Oh my God ! I ca n’t believe you guys are going through with this . Look at me . I ’m sweating . ”
22300	22337	22297	22297	I	1723	“ Relax . It ’s going great . Mom and Dad are so happy , they ’re not even questioning the fact that we ’re obviously rushing into something that will be a big fat mistake . ”
22351	22357	22358	22358	Ellie	60	“ Neither are the Morettis , ”
22361	22366	22358	22358	Ellie	60	“ Except maybe Pietro . ”
22367	22397	22358	22358	Ellie	60	“ Well , he ’s about to lose the opportunity to be head of the family firm . Understandable why he might be reluctant to offer his heartiest congrats . ”
22398	22413	22414	22414	I	1723	“ Mr. Moretti seems a bit quiet too . Think he ’s got doubts ? ”
22434	22454	22426	22426	his	436	“ Hard to say for sure , but he certainly volunteered to reach out to the judge quickly enough . ”
22455	22466	22426	22426	his	436	“ Maybe he expected you guys to argue against it . ”
22467	22477	22478	22478	We	433	“ Hopefully , he noticed that we did n’t . ”
22495	22507	22508	22508	She	438	“ We do n’t see any reason to push it back . ”
22517	22559	22560	22560	I	1723	“ I still ca n’t believe you guys are going through with it . At least you ’re marrying someone hot . Sometimes it ’s hard to look away from his face . And I ’m not even attracted to men . ”
22573	22581	22560	22560	I	1723	“ He ’s handsome . I agree . ”
22582	22591	22560	22560	I	1723	“ Do you guys get along at all ? ”
22592	22595	22560	22560	I	1723	“ Nope . ”
22607	22651	22652	22652	She	439	“ I mean , we ’re learning better how to fake it , and occasionally I get this glimmer of appreciation or maybe even gratitude for him , but then he says something truly loathsome and I remember why he ’s the worst . ”
22663	22685	22652	22652	She	439	“ I do n’t know , you have pretty good chemistry . Sparks were definitely flying between you at the table . ”
22686	22693	22694	22694	I	1723	“ For all the wrong reasons , ”
22698	22707	22708	22708	She	439	“ Our chemistry is not the good kind . ”
22711	22730	22731	22731	I	1723	“ Sparks are sparks . And it would not surprise me at all if eventually something catches fire . ”
22739	22743	22731	22731	I	1723	“ Not happening . ”
22752	22765	22747	22747	her	439	“ You ’re telling me you ’re not attracted to him whatsoever ? ”
22766	22769	22771	22771	I	1723	“ Nope . ”
22790	22808	22809	22809	She	439	“ Plus we ’ve agreed there will be no messing around . It ’s in the contract . ”
22814	22822	22809	22809	She	439	“ You guys actually made a contract ? ”
22823	22834	22835	22835	I	1723	“ Yes . We had to lay the ground rules , ”
22849	22858	22809	22809	She	439	“ So what was that kiss out there ? ”
22888	22894	22809	22809	She	439	“ That was for show . ”
22895	22901	22809	22809	She	439	“ Looked real to me . ”
22902	22920	22809	22809	She	439	“ That ’s because I ’m a good actress . Let ’s get back to the table . ”
22939	22952	22953	22953	she	439	“ You know , you ’re really not that good an actress , ”
22960	22964	22953	22953	she	439	“ Just saying . ”
23034	23041	23042	23042	Enzo	256	“ What the hell was that ? ”
23054	23071	23072	23072	I	1723	“ That was our engagement dinner . I thought it went well , by the way , ”
23079	23093	23072	23072	I	1723	“ I meant that kiss . What the fuck was up with that ? ”
23126	23152	23153	23153	He	442	“ Kissing is something a real couple would do at their engagement dinner , do n’t you think ? I was trying to be authentic . ”
23189	23204	23177	23177	His	442	“ You were the one who said no kissing allowed , and I agreed . ”
23205	23208	23209	23209	I	1723	“ Sorry , ”
23215	23227	23209	23209	I	1723	“ I did n’t realize it would bother you so much . ”
23228	23258	23263	23263	he	442	“ It ’s not that it bothered me . I was just . . . unprepared . I think we need to agree on that stuff ahead of time . ”
23279	23336	23273	23273	I	1723	“ Enzo , if we ’re going to fake being in love , we ’re going to have to do things couples in love do when we ’re in front of other people . It ’s part of the act . I mean , we ’re going to have to kiss at the ceremony , right ? ”
23337	23342	23343	23343	he	442	“ That ’s different , ”
23346	23360	23343	23343	he	442	“ That ’s expected . This was unexpected . And it threw me . ”
23361	23368	23369	23369	I	1723	“ Okay , okay . Sheesh . ”
23377	23391	23369	23369	I	1723	“ I ’ll give you a warning next time , how ’s that ? ”
23392	23416	23417	23417	He	442	“ I do n’t need a warning , Bianca . Now that I know that kissing is approved , I ’ll be fine . ”
23423	23440	23441	23441	My	1723	“ I did n’t realize you ’d have such a hard time controlling yourself around me . ”
23445	23470	23441	23441	My	1723	“ I do n’t have a hard time controlling myself around you , Enzo . I told you , I was playing the game . ”
23471	23474	23475	23475	he	442	“ Right , ”
23479	23483	23475	23475	he	442	“ The game . ”
23494	23515	23516	23516	He	442	“ Speaking of unapproved moves , what was all that BS about me crying tears of joy when you proposed ? ”
23519	23545	23546	23546	he	442	“ That ’s what girls are supposed to do when they ’re happy , is n’t it ? I was just trying to be authentic , ”
23556	23572	23546	23546	he	442	“ You were n’t being authentic , you were being obnoxious . My prickly surface ? ”
23573	23592	23593	23593	He	442	“ Listen , you were n’t any better , telling them I begged you to be my wife . ”
23604	23620	23593	23593	He	442	“ Please . I ’ve never begged a woman to do anything in my life . ”
23621	23643	23644	23644	He	442	“ That was before . Now that you ’re in love with me , everything is different . You definitely begged . ”
23679	23687	23688	23688	I	1723	“ Listen , let ’s not fight , ”
23691	23723	23688	23688	I	1723	“ We ’ve got issues to deal with . Do you think your dad can really get the judge to give us a wedding date by the end of the week ? ”
23724	23734	23735	23735	He	442	“ Probably . My dad can be very persuasive . ”
23741	23751	23735	23735	He	442	“ So we should be prepared to move fast . ”
23752	23755	23756	23756	He	442	“ Okay . ”
23767	23785	23756	23756	He	442	“ If you ’re going to back out , Bianca , do it now . Last chance . ”
23799	23811	23790	23790	I	1723	“ If you ’re still in , I ’m still in . ”
23812	23829	23830	23830	Enzo	256	“ I ’m still in . We should talk about where we ’re going to live , ”
23833	23839	23830	23830	Enzo	256	“ My place or yours . ”
23840	23855	23856	23856	Enzo	256	“ Oh yeah . I guess one of us has to move , huh ? ”
23859	23878	23879	23879	I	1723	“ Uh , yes . I do n’t think it would be too convincing if we lived separately . ”
23914	23947	23879	23879	I	1723	“ Your place is bigger . I suppose it makes more sense . But I hate to give up my condo . . . eventually I ’m going to need it back . ”
23948	23953	23954	23954	he	315	“ So keep it , ”
23957	23963	23964	23964	I	1723	“ Let JJ live there . ”
23970	24006	23964	23964	I	1723	“ I guess . But I ’ll have to kick him out when I need to move back in . I do n’t want to live with him or be stuck with nowhere to go . ”
24007	24018	24019	24019	Enzo	256	“ You wo n’t have nowhere to go , Bianca . ”
24025	24056	24057	24057	I	1723	“ Do you think I ’d put you out on the street with our baby ? If it comes to it , I can always go stay at Beckett ’s . ”
24063	24077	24078	24078	He	448	“ Really ? You ’d move out of your own house for me ? ”
24081	24084	24078	24078	He	448	“ Sure . ”
24085	24088	24089	24089	I	1723	“ Thanks , ”
24120	24130	24131	24131	Enzo	256	“ Thanks for the ride . And for dinner . ”
24143	24148	24131	24131	Enzo	256	“ You ’re welcome . ”
24164	24177	24131	24131	Enzo	256	“ Do you want to come in for a drink or something ? ”
24178	24184	24131	24131	Enzo	256	“ I guess I could . ”
24185	24189	24190	24190	I	1723	“ No pressure , ”
24194	24206	24190	24190	I	1723	“ If you ’ve got other plans , it ’s fine . ”
24207	24212	24213	24213	he	448	“ No other plans , ”
24230	24248	24190	24190	I	1723	“ I ’m just surprised you ’d want to spend any more time with me than necessary . ”
24249	24259	24260	24260	I	1723	“ I ’m trying to get used to you , ”
24263	24285	24260	24260	I	1723	“ It ’s like exposure therapy . And pretty soon , all our Saturday nights are going to be spent together . ”
24286	24291	24292	24292	he	448	“ Ca n’t wait , ”
24321	24327	24301	24301	he	448	“ You got any whiskey ? ”
24328	24346	24347	24347	He	448	“ I do , in fact . And I make a mean Manhattan if you ’re interested . ”
24355	24360	24361	24361	My	1723	“ I ’m interested . ”
24392	24398	24399	24400	Five Enzo	256	“ Then come on in . ”
24401	24408	24409	24409	Bianca	1472	“ What should we drink to ? ”
24429	24439	24440	24440	I	1723	“ To a long and happy life — apart , ”
24727	24733	24734	24734	she	453	“ Flip any houses lately ? ”
24737	24743	24734	24734	she	453	“ Not really . You ? ”
24744	24812	24813	24813	She	453	“ Not in a while . I was working with a friend in Chicago who was sort of the money behind the deals — I did all the legwork , supervised the renovations , and then I turned it over to a real estate agent friend to make the sale — but the friend in Chicago lost big on a few risky stock investments and pulled back . ”
24816	24834	24813	24813	She	453	“ And I knew I needed to save up for fertility treatments . They ’re not cheap . ”
24835	24839	24840	24840	I	1723	“ Got it . ”
24848	24856	24840	24840	I	1723	“ Did you like living in Chicago ? ”
24857	24903	24813	24813	She	453	“ I did , believe it or not . I never really thought of myself as a city girl , and I hated the traffic , but I did like the convenience of having lots of shopping and dining options right there in my neighborhood . ”
24904	24912	24913	24913	She	453	“ Where in Chicago did you live ? ”
24956	24980	24953	24953	they	455	“ When I first moved down there , I lived on campus . Then I had an apartment with a girlfriend in Bucktown . ”
24988	25012	24953	24953	they	455	“ But for the last four years , I lived with my boyfriend downtown . He had a condo on Lake Shore Drive . ”
25013	25016	25017	25017	I	1723	“ Fancy , ”
25037	25041	25032	25032	She	456	“ It was . ”
25042	25054	24953	24953	they	455	“ Four years , huh ? That ’s a long time . ”
25055	25063	25064	25064	I	1723	“ We were actually together for five . ”
25068	25074	25064	25064	I	1723	“ What was his name ? ”
25075	25079	25081	25081	he	456	“ Tate DuCharme . ”
25089	25094	25081	25081	he	456	“ So what happened ? ”
25163	25173	25174	25174	she	456	“ What happened was that I was an idiot , ”
25181	25218	25174	25174	she	456	“ I believed his lies , I let him convince me he just needed more time , and I turned a blind eye to all the signs he would never be ready for a lifetime commitment . ”
25219	25227	25174	25174	she	456	“ Why ’d you do all that ? ”
25228	25234	25235	25235	Her	456	“ Because I loved him . ”
25263	25286	25259	25259	her	456	“ And I wanted him to love me back the same way . But no amount of wanting could make that true . ”
25287	25295	25296	25296	I	1723	“ But he must have loved you , ”
25299	25310	25311	25311	She	456	“ Why else would he date you for five years ? ”
25321	25339	25311	25311	She	456	“ Maybe he loved me . But not enough . And what ’s the use of that ? ”
25347	25429	25430	25430	She	456	“ He always had some condition that had to be met , or some goal he had to reach , before he could think about the next phase of his life — getting married and having a family , which is what he said he ultimately wanted . For a while , it was turning thirty , then it was making partner at his firm , then it was landing this certain big client , then it was closing the case . ”
25435	25480	25430	25430	She	456	“ But there was always another big client and the next big case . I realized I was never going to come first . And then I realized that it was all lies anyway — he was sleeping with a woman at his firm . ”
25481	25488	25489	25489	I	1723	“ Seriously ? What a prick . ”
25525	25534	25512	25512	I	1723	“ And she probably was n’t the first . ”
25535	25542	25543	25543	I	1723	“ I ’m sorry , Bianca , ”
25559	25617	25512	25512	I	1723	“ The worst thing was , even after that came to light , I went to him and said , ‘ Last chance . If you want a life with me , it starts now . ’ And he said he was n’t willing to give up the life he had for the future we ’d planned . ”
25618	25621	25512	25512	I	1723	“ Fuck . ”
25634	25640	25641	25641	She	1723	“ What did you do ? ”
25650	25680	25641	25641	She	1723	“ I left him that night and went to stay with a friend . Quit my job the next day . Two weeks later , I moved back here . ”
25681	25695	25641	25641	She	1723	“ You did the right thing . That asshole did n’t deserve you . ”
25696	25704	25705	25705	she	1723	“ Thanks . So what about you ? ”
25744	25749	25740	25740	I	1723	“ What about me ? ”
25794	25802	25803	25803	She	1723	“ What ’s been your longest relationship ? ”
25814	25818	25819	25819	She	1723	“ Define relationship . ”
25822	25841	25819	25819	She	1723	“ It ’s a thing where you date one person exclusively for a somewhat lengthy period of time . ”
25842	25845	25846	25846	I	1723	“ Hmm . ”
25851	25874	25875	25875	She	1723	“ I believe there was a girl in high school that I drove home from school every day for like four months . ”
25882	25894	25875	25875	She	1723	“ That ’s not a relationship , that ’s a carpool . ”
25895	25923	25924	25924	Her	1723	“ If her parents were n’t home , sometimes she ’d invite me in and give me a hand job in her bedroom . Does that help ? ”
25928	25936	25924	25924	Her	1723	“ No . You ’re a pig . ”
25937	25947	25948	25948	I	1723	“ Oh relax , I actually liked that girl . ”
25955	25962	25948	25948	I	1723	“ And I returned the favor . ”
25963	25967	25968	25968	Her	1723	“ Did you ? ”
25976	25996	25997	25997	She	1723	“ Of course I did . I ’m a gentleman and a feminist . I always return a favor . ”
26017	26022	25997	25997	She	1723	“ What about Juliet ? ”
26023	26026	25997	25997	She	1723	“ Who ? ”
26027	26044	25997	25997	She	1723	“ Juliet . The one who blew you in the parking lot after the Romeo audition . ”
26045	26050	25997	25997	She	1723	“ What about her ? ”
26051	26058	25997	25997	She	1723	“ Did you return that favor ? ”
26059	26072	25997	25997	She	1723	“ Not in the parking lot . But yes , I did . ”
26073	26076	25997	25997	She	1723	“ Interesting . ”
26077	26083	26084	26084	She	1723	“ Why ’s that interesting ? ”
26087	26102	26084	26084	She	1723	“ I do n’t know . Some guys do n’t like returning that favor . ”
26103	26109	26110	26110	She	1723	“ Some guys are idiots . ”
26124	26131	26110	26110	She	1723	“ Are you good at it ? ”
26139	26142	26110	26110	She	1723	“ Huh ? ”
26143	26150	26151	26151	Her	1723	“ Are you good at it ? ”
26156	26173	26151	26151	Her	1723	“ I mean , what if I want to brag about your sexual prowess or something ? ”
26174	26178	26110	26110	She	1723	“ To who ? ”
26179	26185	26186	26186	Her	1723	“ I do n’t know . ”
26190	26195	26196	26196	Recovering	118	“ Girls talk sometimes . ”
26208	26232	26201	26201	I	1723	“ Well , you can safely brag about my talent in that capacity . I know my way around a woman ’s orgasm . ”
26233	26237	26238	26238	She	1723	“ Do you ? ”
26261	26279	26280	26280	Her	1723	“ Yes . I ’m patient , intuitive , and very , very good with my tongue . ”
26295	26307	26290	26290	she	1723	“ And with my lips , my hands , and my — ”
26308	26315	26316	26316	she	1723	“ Okay , that ’s enough , ”
26327	26343	26316	26316	she	1723	“ It ’s getting late , and I have to get up for church tomorrow . ”
26344	26347	26348	26348	I	1723	“ Same . ”
26373	26384	26385	26385	She	1723	“ And a gentleman knows when to make his exit . ”
26405	26411	26412	26412	I	1723	“ Thanks for the drink , ”
26434	26439	26423	26423	she	1723	“ You ’re welcome . ”
26459	26468	26469	26469	I	1723	“ You know , I could stay over , ”
26473	26483	26469	26469	I	1723	“ Keep you nice and warm all night long . ”
26484	26487	26488	26488	she	1723	“ Nope , ”
26499	26504	26488	26488	she	1723	“ Goodnight , Enzo . ”
26519	26523	26524	26524	She	1723	“ No kiss ? ”
27194	27198	27189	27189	Bianca	1472	“ Get out , ”
27220	27231	27236	27236	I	1723	“ Get out and stay out , you redheaded siren . ”
27549	27555	27544	27544	I	1723	“ What ’s this for ? ”
27571	27576	27561	27561	she	1472	“ You ’re welcome , ”
27597	27606	27577	27577	I	1723	“ Sorry . Thank you — they’re beautiful . ”
27622	27632	27607	27607	She	1472	“ It just surprised me , that ’s all . ”
27633	27695	27696	27696	I	1723	“ Why should it surprise you ? I know how you love fresh flowers , and I know white roses are your favorite . Plus , it was a good opportunity for people to see me doing something romantic . I parked sort of far away from the florist so everyone would see me walking down the sidewalk carrying the roses . ”
27707	27713	27714	27714	She	1472	“ I ’m always thinking . ”
27723	27732	27717	27717	she	1472	“ Ah , so it was for show . ”
27733	27741	27742	27742	I	1723	“ Is n’t everything ? Smells good , ”
27753	27759	27742	27742	I	1723	“ What are we having ? ”
27760	27764	27765	27765	I	1723	“ Meatball sandwiches . ”
27768	27772	27765	27765	I	1723	“ My favorite . ”
27773	27783	27784	27784	she	1472	“ I know . Want to pour some wine ? ”
27793	27803	27784	27784	she	1472	“ There are a few bottles in the rack . ”
27804	27807	27808	27808	I	1723	“ Sure . ”
27815	27840	27808	27808	I	1723	“ I ’ll even get the glasses down from the high cupboard for you . Hey , I should put that in my vows . ”
27841	27847	27765	27765	I	1723	“ What do you mean ? ”
27848	27886	27887	27887	I	1723	“ Well , I talked to Judge Reinhart today , and he said the official part of the ceremony is pretty quick and impersonal , so if we wanted to add any personal vows , we could . ”
27897	27906	27907	27907	She	1472	“ And you want to add personal vows ? ”
27921	27932	27933	27933	I	1723	“ I thought it might be more convincing that way , ”
27937	27943	27944	27944	She	1472	“ You might be right . ”
27957	27968	27944	27944	She	1472	“ Thanks again for the roses . I love them . ”
27969	27974	27975	27975	I	1723	“ You ’re welcome . ”
27983	27992	27993	27993	Her	1472	“ I also talked to my father today . ”
27997	28006	27993	27993	Her	1472	“ Oh yeah ? What did he say ? ”
28007	28023	27944	27944	She	1472	“ He said he ’s having paperwork drawn up to name me as his successor . ”
28024	28027	28028	28028	She	1472	“ Cheers . ”
28044	28057	27993	27993	Her	1472	“ Want to make the sandwiches while I put together some antipasto ? ”
28058	28061	27993	27993	Her	1472	“ Sure . ”
28062	28084	27944	27944	She	1472	“ The broiler is ready . I usually stick the rolls in there with a few slices of provolone before I — ”
28085	28096	28097	28097	She	1472	“ I know how to make a sandwich , Bianca . ”
28100	28105	28097	28097	She	1472	“ Do your thing . ”
28121	28130	28131	28131	I	1723	“ Did you tell your family about Friday ? ”
28137	28142	28134	28134	She	1472	“ My mother cried . ”
28143	28147	28148	28148	I	1723	“ Mine too . ”
28167	28178	28134	28134	She	1472	“ By the way , our reception begins at six . ”
28179	28182	28183	28183	she	1472	“ Nice , ”
28186	28191	28134	28134	She	1472	“ Where is it ? ”
28192	28204	28205	28205	Her	1472	“ The Bulldog Pub . We rented out the back room . ”
28209	28219	28205	28205	Her	1472	“ My wedding reception is at the Bulldog Pub ? ”
28220	28241	28242	28242	She	1472	“ Listen , princess , we had to call in a favor to get it , so do n’t complain . ”
28245	28265	28242	28242	She	1472	“ Fine . The Bulldog it is . I need to figure out what I ’m going to wear . ”
28266	28269	28270	28270	I	1723	“ Same . ”
28276	28287	28270	28270	I	1723	“ This is really fucking good , by the way . ”
28288	28301	28242	28242	She	1472	“ Thank you . I think you should wear a black suit . ”
28302	28309	28310	28310	She	1472	“ Okay . What color tie ? ”
28322	28325	28310	28310	She	1472	“ Red . ”
28326	28329	28270	28270	I	1723	“ Done . ”
28330	28340	28341	28341	I	1723	“ I guess I ’ll get a white dress . ”
28344	28363	28341	28341	I	1723	“ Sounds good to me . Do you want another ring ? Like a wedding band or something ? ”
28364	28367	28368	28368	she	1472	“ Nah , ”
28371	28383	28384	28384	I	1723	“ One ring is good enough . You want a ring ? ”
28387	28397	28384	28384	I	1723	“ I ’d wear a ring , I guess . ”
28398	28411	28341	28341	I	1723	“ Okay . I ’ll get you one . What about food ? ”
28412	28440	28441	28441	She	1472	“ I talked to the Bulldog owner . We ’re working it out . If you want to take over the menu planning , be my guest . ”
28444	28461	28441	28441	She	1472	“ I ’ll go over there tomorrow . We ’ll keep it simple . Open bar ? ”
28462	28466	28384	28384	I	1723	“ Probably easiest . ”
28467	28482	28384	28384	I	1723	“ So who ’s coming to this party ? Did you invite anyone today ? ”
28483	28493	28494	28494	I	1723	“ Griffin . Cole . Beckett . My family . ”
28497	28522	28523	28523	Her	484	“ I told my mother no aunts and uncles , no cousins . She claimed they were never going to speak to her again . ”
28535	28541	28528	28528	she	484	“ What did you say ? ”
28542	28552	28553	28553	She	484	“ I said , ‘ You ’re welcome . ’ ”
28605	28621	28622	28622	she	484	“ What the hell ? It ’s like we ’re not in love or something , ”
28625	28638	28622	28622	she	484	“ Maybe we should just let the judge do all the talking . ”
28660	28682	28648	28648	She	484	“ No , I like the idea of personal vows . I think you ’re right about it being more authentic . ”
28683	28693	28694	28694	I	1723	“ Maybe we should write them for each other , ”
28697	28703	28694	28694	I	1723	“ What do you mean ? ”
28704	28730	28648	28648	She	484	“ I mean , you get to come up with a couple things you want me to say , and I ’ll do the same . ”
28739	28752	28648	28648	She	484	“ And we have to say what the other person has written ? ”
28753	28764	28694	28694	I	1723	“ Sure . Just do n’t make it too long . ”
28765	28774	28775	28775	she	484	“ I ’ll keep it short and sweet , ”
28778	28784	28775	28775	she	484	“ But not too sweet . ”
28796	28804	28775	28775	she	484	“ Do n’t make me sound ridiculous . ”
28805	28810	28811	28811	she	484	“ I wo n’t , ”
28816	28842	28775	28775	she	484	“ I ’m just going to make you sound in love with me . You can do the same thing . It ’ll be fun . ”
28843	28846	28775	28775	she	484	“ Fun ? ”
28847	28852	28853	28853	She	484	“ Oh come on . ”
28861	28891	28853	28853	She	484	“ What if this is the only wedding either one of us ever has ? Do n’t we deserve to hear our soul mate say nice things about us ? ”
28892	28905	28906	28906	She	484	“ But it wo n’t be real . It ’s made up . ”
28909	28917	28918	28918	I	1723	“ It ’s what we ’ve got . ”
28943	28953	28939	28939	she	484	“ Thanks for the flowers . I appreciate them . ”
28954	28959	28960	28960	I	1723	“ Thanks for dinner , ”
28983	28987	28988	28988	She	484	“ Any time . ”
28995	29029	29030	29030	I	1723	“ I like cooking for people who love to eat . My ex was always on a health kick — didn’t eat carbs , did n’t eat dairy , did n’t eat sugar . ”
29035	29043	29044	29044	She	484	“ What ’s the point of living ? ”
29047	29050	29044	29044	She	484	“ Right ? ”
29051	29056	29044	29044	She	484	“ Well , goodnight . ”
29057	29060	29061	29061	I	1723	“ Night . ”
29214	29222	29223	29223	I	1723	“ They still do that volcano project ? ”
29236	29253	29254	29254	He	492	“ Yep . And it makes just as big a mess as when we did it . ”
29260	29273	29254	29254	He	492	“ Bet you ’ll be doing that same project in ten years . ”
29287	29290	29254	29254	He	492	“ Maybe . ”
29291	29296	29254	29254	He	492	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
29297	29300	29301	29301	I	1723	“ Nothing . ”
29314	29323	29324	29324	Cole	81	“ Just a lot going on this week . ”
29327	29352	29324	29324	Cole	81	“ No shit . You ’re getting married in two days . I had to trade my Saturday off in order to be there . ”
29353	29356	29254	29254	He	492	“ Sorry . ”
29357	29375	29376	29376	Cole	81	“ Hey , I was joking . You know I do n’t care about the day off . ”
29383	29389	29390	29390	I	1723	“ What ’s going on ? ”
29401	29421	29390	29390	I	1723	“ It ’s not a big deal . Bianca just said something yesterday that put me in a funk . ”
29422	29443	29324	29324	Cole	81	“ Do n’t let it get to you . You guys know exactly how to push each other ’s buttons . ”
29444	29450	29390	29390	I	1723	“ It ’s not that . ”
29451	29462	29463	29463	Cole	81	“ Then what is it ? What did she say ? ”
29470	29535	29536	29536	Cole	81	“ We ’re writing each other ’s vows — don’t ask , it was my stupid idea , which I now regret — and when I warned her not to go overboard , she said something like , ‘ What if this is the only wedding either one of us ever has ? Do n’t we deserve to hear nice things about ourselves ? ’ ”
29540	29543	29536	29536	Cole	81	“ Okay . ”
29544	29583	29536	29536	Cole	81	“ And it just made me , I do n’t know , sad or something . She ’s throwing away her one chance to hear someone say why he wants to spend his life with her on me . ”
29584	29592	29593	29593	I	1723	“ So say nice things about her . ”
29602	29610	29596	29596	He	497	“ But I wo n’t mean them . ”
29611	29620	29536	29536	Cole	81	“ So ? It ’s what she wants . ”
29621	29630	29631	29631	I	1723	“ Something about it does n’t feel right , ”
29640	29679	29635	29635	Cole	81	“ Moretti , you are marrying this girl on Friday afternoon . Not because you love her , but so that you can inherit your family business . And you ’re worried about the three - minute vows ? ”
29680	29697	29698	29698	I	1723	“ When you put it that way , I guess it does sound kind of stupid , ”
29701	29747	29698	29698	I	1723	“ I do n’t think it ’s stupid that you do n’t want to say things you do n’t mean — I think it ’s admirable . But realistically , you are faking this relationship . It always involved a measure of dishonesty , right ? ”
29748	29751	29635	29635	Cole	81	“ Right . ”
29752	29761	29698	29698	I	1723	“ And you ’re not lying to Bianca . ”
29762	29780	29698	29698	I	1723	“ No . We ’re open about everything . We know exactly what we ’re getting into . ”
29804	29830	29831	29831	He	499	“ Then you have to trust each other . She chose this too , after all . She picked you to have a child with . ”
29844	29852	29831	29831	He	499	“ That ’s a big fucking deal . ”
29853	29856	29857	29857	I	1723	“ Yeah . ”
29874	29880	29857	29857	I	1723	“ Did you tell Cheyenne ? ”
29881	29900	29831	29831	He	499	“ I did . I do n’t keep big stuff from her . I hope that was okay . ”
29901	29906	29907	29907	I	1723	“ It ’s fine . ”
29911	29919	29907	29907	I	1723	“ Does she think it ’s crazy ? ”
29920	29931	29932	29932	He	499	“ Yes . But she ’s weirdly happy about it . ”
29939	29947	29932	29932	He	499	“ I think she just likes weddings . ”
29948	29955	29956	29956	I	1723	“ This one should be interesting . ”
29961	29980	29981	29981	Cole	81	“ I can not imagine what Bianca is going to make me say about her during those vows . ”
29984	29996	29981	29981	Cole	81	“ What are you going to make her say about you ? ”
29997	30004	30006	30006	my	1723	“ I have no fucking idea . ”
30014	30026	30028	30028	Bianca	1472	“ But do n’t worry , I ’ll make it good . ”
30029	30039	30028	30028	Bianca	1472	“ That ’s it . That ’s the one , ”
30064	30081	30082	30083	my sister	0	“ Mom , you ’ve said that about every dress she ’s tried on so far , ”
30111	30119	30120	30120	I	1723	“ I kind of like this one , ”
30237	30249	30251	30252	the saleswoman	505	“ That ’s a great choice for a bride your size , ”
30260	30266	30251	30252	the saleswoman	505	“ Sorry I ’m late ! ”
30327	30332	30312	30312	She	256	“ Oh my God . ”
30333	30339	30340	30340	I	1723	“ What do you think ? ”
30346	30351	30352	30352	She	256	“ I love it . ”
30360	30378	30379	30379	She	256	“ It ’s sweet , it ’s elegant , it ’s fun , it suits your personality . ”
30382	30387	30379	30379	She	256	“ It ’s perfect . ”
30388	30394	30395	30395	I	1723	“ I like it too . ”
30401	30408	30395	30395	I	1723	“ But is it too formal ? ”
30409	30414	30415	30415	Blair	1472	“ Not at all , ”
30419	30428	30415	30415	Blair	1472	“ Honey , this is your wedding dress , ”
30433	30439	30429	30430	my mother	256	“ It should be formal . ”
30440	30473	30429	30430	my mother	256	“ But I ’m getting married at City Hall , Mom . And my reception is at the Bulldog Pub . We ’ll be eating sliders and fries and drinking boxed wine . ”
30474	30483	30484	30484	Blair	1472	“ And it ’s going to be amazing , ”
30500	30519	30492	30492	She	256	“ It does n’t even need to be altered , which is a sure sign from the universe . ”
30520	30529	30530	30530	I	1723	“ Then I guess this is the one . ”
30536	30540	30530	30530	I	1723	“ Unzip me ? ”
30541	30558	30559	30559	Anita	119	“ Wait , you ’re not even going to try on any of the other ones ? ”
30563	30580	30559	30559	Anita	119	“ You ’ve only tried on three . Most brides try on at least a dozen . ”
30581	30588	30590	30591	my sister	256	“ She ’s not most brides , ”
30604	30611	30612	30612	Anita	119	“ Still . Are you sure ? ”
30621	30643	30612	30612	Anita	119	“ I ’m sure . My wedding is on Friday , so I do n’t really have a lot of time . ”
30644	30649	30650	30650	she	256	“ That ’s true , ”
30653	30668	30650	30650	she	256	“ And this is stunning on you . Should we try a little veil ? ”
30669	30672	30673	30673	I	1723	“ No , ”
30677	30681	30673	30673	I	1723	“ No veil . ”
30682	30688	30689	30689	Anita	119	“ Just a short one ? ”
30694	30711	30689	30689	Anita	119	“ Give me one minute . I have the perfect thing . It just came in . ”
30727	30748	30749	30749	I	1723	“ The dress is so beautiful , Bianca . Enzo is going to lose his marbles when he sees you . ”
30752	30766	30749	30749	I	1723	“ Thanks . Nothing I like more than making Enzo lose his marbles . ”
30767	30781	30782	30782	she	256	“ It ’s just amazing the way you two fell for each other , ”
30791	30805	30782	30782	she	256	“ To think , you ’ve known each other almost your entire lives . ”
30806	30816	30817	30818	my mother	256	“ Is n’t it romantic and old - fashioned ? ”
30839	30844	30834	30834	Her	256	“ Stop , Mom . ”
30896	30900	30901	30901	Anita	119	“ This one ! ”
30947	30955	30956	30956	Anita	119	“ It ’s called a birdcage veil , ”
30959	30971	30956	30956	Anita	119	“ It ’s a vintage style , but very trendy again . ”
30972	30977	30978	30978	Blair	1472	“ Oh , Bianca , ”
30981	30991	30978	30978	Blair	1472	“ It ’s so beautiful with your red hair . ”
30992	30998	30999	30999	I	1723	“ What do you think ? ”
31021	31027	31018	31018	she	256	“ It ’s perfect , B. ”
31083	31094	31095	31095	I	1723	“ Anyone up for a glass of wine after this ? ”
31098	31112	31095	31095	I	1723	“ I have to go over to the pub to finalize the menu . ”
31113	31117	31118	31118	Blair	1472	“ I am , ”
31122	31144	31118	31118	Blair	1472	“ I want to hear the whole proposal story from start to finish . Griffin was absolutely useless on the details . ”
31145	31162	31163	31164	my mother	241	“ I wish I could , but I have to get home and feed your father , ”
31171	31181	31167	31167	Ellie	60	“ Sorry , I have to get home too . ”
31212	31223	31224	31224	she	241	“ I wish I could get married all over again , ”
31227	31239	31240	31240	I	1723	“ At City Hall ? With your reception at the Bulldog ? ”
31250	31283	31284	31284	She	241	“ Yes ! I would n’t care . Do n’t get me wrong , I loved my wedding at Cloverleigh Farms , but it wo n’t matter where you are , Bianca . ”
31296	31332	31333	31333	I	1723	“ The only thing that will matter is hearing Enzo promise to love , honor , and cherish you for the rest of your life . And getting to make the same promise right back . ”
31338	31341	31333	31333	I	1723	“ Yeah . ”
31480	31486	31487	31487	I	1723	“ I ’ll take it , ”
31490	31493	31487	31487	I	1723	“ Done . ”
31622	31663	31610	31610	Blair	1472	“ Cheers . I ’m so happy for you , honey . I do n’t blame you one bit for not wanting to wait to get married . When you know , you know . Now show me that ring . ”
31680	31685	31686	31686	she	1472	“ Oh , Bianca , ”
31690	31718	31686	31686	she	1472	“ It ’s beautiful . The stone is big but not ostentatious , it ’s a classic setting , and yellow gold is so stylish right now . ”
31726	31732	31733	31733	I	1723	“ It ’s not real , ”
31736	31739	31740	31740	Blair	1472	“ What ? ”
31745	31754	31740	31740	Blair	1472	“ You mean it ’s a fake diamond ? ”
31755	31762	31686	31686	she	1472	“ It ’s a fake engagement . ”
31763	31776	31740	31740	Blair	1472	“ I do n’t understand . You ’re not really getting married ? ”
31777	31802	31803	31803	I	1723	“ No , we ’re getting married . That part is real . And as far as I know , the diamond is real . ”
31808	31815	31803	31803	I	1723	“ But everything else is fake . ”
31816	31826	31740	31740	Blair	1472	“ But . . . I do n’t understand . ”
31827	31832	31833	31833	I	1723	“ Drink some wine , ”
31844	31855	31857	31857	she	1472	“ You ’re going to need it for this story . ”
31917	31925	31901	31901	She	1472	“ So you ’re not in love ? ”
31935	31942	31943	31943	I	1723	“ No , we ’re not . ”
31952	31975	31976	31976	She	1472	“ I think we might like each other a little better at this point , but we are definitely not in love . ”
31980	31986	31976	31976	She	1472	“ This is so depressing . ”
31987	31991	31992	31992	I	1723	“ Not really , ”
32008	32038	31976	31976	She	1472	“ We ’re doing this for one another . We ’re going to get exactly what we want in the end . No one is going to get hurt . ”
32039	32045	32046	32046	She	1472	“ But I ’m hurt . ”
32058	32072	32054	32054	she	1472	“ Maybe you ’ll fall in love for real once you ’re married ! ”
32073	32081	32082	32082	I	1723	“ Good God , I hope not , ”
32089	32093	32082	32082	I	1723	“ Why not ? ”
32094	32120	32054	32054	she	1472	“ This plan works specifically because we ’re not in love . Phase three would be a disaster if one of us had real feelings . ”
32134	32138	32054	32054	she	1472	“ Phase three ? ”
32139	32146	32147	32147	I	1723	“ The plan has three phases , ”
32176	32207	32168	32168	I	1723	“ We ’re in phase one right now — that ’s the engagement and wedding . The marriage and getting pregnant is phase two . The breakup is phase three . ”
32208	32225	32226	32226	she	1472	“ But if you really fell in love , you would n’t have to break up , ”
32235	32259	32230	32230	I	1723	“ We will not be in love , Blair . We ’re not like you and Griffin . This is a business arrangement . ”
32260	32264	32168	32168	I	1723	“ But maybe — ”
32265	32268	32269	32269	I	1723	“ No , ”
32277	32353	32354	32354	She	1723	“ I do n’t think you understand — I do n’t want to fall for Enzo . I was in love with someone in Chicago for five years , and it was toxic and terrible and tore me apart . It took me a long time to feel whole again , and now that I do , I do n’t plan on giving anyone that kind of power over me , especially not Enzo Moretti . ”
32360	32375	32354	32354	She	1723	“ I ’m really sorry about the bad relationship . I did n’t know . ”
32376	32392	32393	32393	I	1723	“ I do n’t talk about it much . And it does n’t matter now . ”
32398	32482	32393	32393	I	1723	“ Sorry I got testy . I do n’t love discussing my romantic past . But I ’m never going to be hurt like that again . Because I realized I do n’t need a man for what I really want — to be a mom . To raise a child . There is nothing between Enzo and me except some bad blood and a contract — which , by the way , I have just violated by telling you the whole truth . ”
32483	32489	32490	32490	she	1723	“ My lips are sealed , ”
32493	32508	32509	32509	I	1723	“ I wo n’t even tell Griff if you do n’t want me to . ”
32514	32527	32509	32509	I	1723	“ I hate asking you to keep a secret from your husband . ”
32528	32546	32547	32547	she	1723	“ In this particular case , I do n’t think he ’d want to know the truth , ”
32550	32556	32547	32547	she	1723	“ So we ’re okay . ”
32557	32560	32561	32561	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
32586	32594	32595	32595	She	1723	“ You think this is a mistake ? ”
32606	32646	32595	32595	She	1723	“ I do n’t know . My gut reaction was shock , but honestly I feel like people have probably gotten married for worse reasons . At least you two are being completely honest with each other about things . ”
32647	32651	32595	32595	She	1723	“ We are . ”
32652	32660	32661	32661	She	1723	“ Then who am I to judge ? ”
32666	32739	32661	32661	She	1723	“ I think women have to be bold sometimes to get what they want . Be adventuresome . Think outside the box . I know I had to . And it was n’t easy for me — I’d been raised to do what I was told , what was expected of me . Instead , I struck out on my own and did things my way . And look at me now . ”
32740	32745	32746	32746	I	1723	“ I ’m looking , ”
32750	32786	32746	32746	I	1723	“ And I ’ve always admired your independent spirit . Someday , I hope to feel that way too — like I can look back without regret on the day I became Mrs. Enzo Moretti . ”
32787	32791	32661	32661	She	1723	“ Excuse me , ”
32800	32808	32661	32661	She	1723	“ Did you say Mrs. Enzo Moretti ? ”
32868	32871	32872	32872	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
32877	32895	32896	32896	She	527	“ You must be Reina . I ’ve heard so much about you . I ’m Bianca . ”
32901	32916	32917	32917	I	1723	“ Are you his — so you ’re like — did you marry him ? ”
32920	32932	32933	32933	Her	527	“ Not yet . We ’re tying the knot this Friday . ”
32942	32946	32933	32933	Her	527	“ This Friday ? ”
32947	33011	33012	33012	I	1723	“ Yes . I know , it seems fast . We only reconnected after the two of you stopped seeing one another . But years ago , we were deeply in love . High school sweethearts , in fact . We only broke up when I left for college . When we started up again , it was like no time had passed . ”
33017	33024	33012	33012	I	1723	“ Instant rekindling of the flame . ”
33025	33033	33034	33034	she	527	“ He wanted to marry me too , ”
33060	33072	33054	33054	She	527	“ In fact , he proposed with that very same ring . ”
33073	33108	33109	33109	I	1723	“ Well , thank God you do n’t know a good thing when you see it , or else I would n’t be marrying the love of my life in two days , right ? ”
33117	33159	33109	33109	I	1723	“ Well , I should get home — he ’s got dinner waiting , and I ’m starved . Although he ’s such an animal , he probably wo n’t even let me eat before he starts tearing my clothes off . ”
33160	33167	33168	33168	Reina	46	“ He tears your clothes off ? ”
33178	33186	33168	33168	Reina	46	“ Constantly . The man is insatiable . ”
33246	33254	33242	33242	Enzo	256	“ Could we get our bill please ? ”
33255	33263	33216	33216	she	46	“ I ’ve got this , Bianca . ”
33280	33290	33271	33271	Blair	1472	“ You go on home to your insatiable fiancé . ”
33291	33296	33297	33297	I	1723	“ Thanks , Blair . ”
33302	33326	33297	33297	I	1723	“ I ’ll talk to you later . Lovely to meet you , Reina ! Maybe we ’ll see you here Friday night . ”
33327	33335	33271	33271	Blair	1472	“ I ’m not working Friday night . ”
33336	33352	33297	33297	I	1723	“ What a bummer ! Well , maybe we ’ll see you around . Ta ! ”
33405	33414	33401	33401	he	532	“ What the hell ? You mean Reina ? ”
33415	33418	33421	33421	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
33428	33444	33421	33421	I	1723	“ She ’s super hot . Why did n’t you want to bang her again ? ”
33445	33458	33401	33401	he	532	“ I just did n’t , okay ? What did she say ? ”
33459	33484	33485	33485	Enzo	256	“ Well , she overheard me talking about the wedding , and she was confused , since you had proposed to her so recently . ”
33488	33552	33485	33485	Enzo	256	“ Do n’t worry , I made it all work . I told her how we ’d been high school sweethearts back in the day — I figured she was in diapers that long ago , anyway — and thank goodness she rejected your suit , because that opened the door for our magical reunion and now all is as it should be . ”
33553	33559	33421	33421	I	1723	“ And she bought it ? ”
33560	33592	33421	33421	I	1723	“ As far as I know . I ’m pretty sure she was too busy being offended that you never touched her but you ca n’t keep your hands off me . ”
33593	33603	33485	33485	Enzo	256	“ What the fuck ? Who told her that ? ”
33604	33608	33609	33609	I	1723	“ I did , ”
33614	33621	33626	33626	he	1435	“ And it was really fun . ”
33632	33639	33626	33626	he	1435	“ I bet she was pissed . ”
33640	33672	33421	33421	I	1723	“ I think baffled is a more fair assessment . I could see the wheels spinning , like she was trying to figure out what I have that she does n’t . ”
33673	33676	33626	33626	he	1435	“ Ha . ”
33677	33696	33626	33626	he	1435	“ Seriously , Enzo . The girl is stunning . Why did n’t you want to bang her ? ”
33697	33703	33704	33704	He	1435	“ I do n’t know . ”
33710	33720	33704	33704	He	1435	“ She just did n’t do anything for me . ”
33721	33724	33725	33725	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
33732	33759	33725	33725	I	1723	“ Or maybe I was too preoccupied to think about sex , worrying about how I was going to get my dad to change his mind . ”
33760	33764	33765	33765	I	1723	“ Problem solved , ”
33769	33782	33765	33765	I	1723	“ Not really . I just traded one problem for another one . ”
33783	33789	33704	33704	He	1435	“ How do you mean ? ”
33790	33829	33765	33765	I	1723	“ Well , I ’m meeting with my dad and his lawyer tomorrow to sign all the paperwork transferring majority ownership of Moretti & Sons to me , but I ’ll be celibate for at least a year . ”
33830	33836	33837	33837	I	1723	“ Oh . That problem . ”
33852	33866	33837	33837	I	1723	“ Well , it ’s a problem we ’ll share , at least . ”
33867	33874	33704	33704	He	1435	“ Will you even miss it ? ”
33875	33878	33837	33837	I	1723	“ Sex ? ”
33879	33889	33890	33890	My	1723	“ Is n’t that what we ’re talking about ? ”
33908	33919	33897	33897	I	1723	“ Yes . But hopefully I ’ll be pregnant soon . ”
33920	33930	33837	33837	I	1723	“ What does that have to do with it ? ”
33931	33942	33943	33943	I	1723	“ My body will be . . . otherwise engaged , ”
33946	33962	33943	33943	I	1723	“ I ’ll be too busy growing a human to worry about satisfying selfish needs . ”
33963	33978	33897	33897	I	1723	“ Is that really what you think ? That sex is a selfish need ? ”
33979	33992	33897	33897	I	1723	“ You do n’t think there ’s something selfish about sexual gratification ? ”
33993	34016	34017	34017	I	1723	“ No . Because I always make sure whoever I ’m with is gratified first and fully before I think about myself . ”
34024	34027	34017	34017	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
34028	34052	34062	34062	I	1723	“ Sex is n’t selfish , Bianca . People are selfish . And it sounds like you ’ve only been with selfish people . ”
34053	34061	34062	34062	I	1723	“ There have n’t been that many , ”
34124	34163	34118	34118	he	1723	“ Whatever . I ’m not one to judge someone for their sexual behavior — no , I take it back . I judge those assholes you were with who made you think sex was a selfish act . ”
34164	34174	34175	34175	I	1723	“ Maybe it ’s my old Catholic guilt talking , ”
34181	34230	34175	34175	I	1723	“ When you spend all those years being taught by nuns , you grow up associating sex outside marriage — or even taking pleasure in it — with sin and shame . It took some time for me to unlearn that stuff and be okay with enjoying myself . ”
34231	34240	34118	34118	he	1723	“ Clearly I did not attend Catholic schools . ”
34241	34281	34118	34118	he	1723	“ Well , I think it ’s something they mostly emphasize to girls . I used to think you could get pregnant if you lay down next to a man in bed , even if you were fully clothed . ”
34282	34298	34175	34175	I	1723	“ Jesus . We ’re not sending our kid to Catholic schools , are we ? ”
34306	34321	34175	34175	I	1723	“ I ’m not sure . I have n’t thought that far ahead yet . ”
34322	34337	34175	34175	I	1723	“ Yeah , I guess we do n’t need to worry about it now . ”
34338	34374	34175	34175	I	1723	“ What we do need to worry about is when I ’m moving in with you . People are going to think it ’s weird if we get married and I still live here alone . ”
34375	34378	34175	34175	I	1723	“ Right . ”
34379	34441	34442	34442	Enzo	256	“ JJ is all set to move in here . My parents love the idea because they ’re so sick of him living at home . They even offered to pay half his rent . If he ’d quit all the stupid trips to Vegas and betting on sports , he ’d be able to afford a place of his own . ”
34445	34466	34442	34442	Enzo	256	“ Yeah , some guys are like that . Okay , so why do n’t we move you in Saturday ? ”
34467	34470	34442	34442	Enzo	256	“ Okay . ”
34488	34495	34479	34479	I	1723	“ We ’ll be married then . ”
34496	34504	34442	34442	Enzo	256	“ You ’re right . We will . ”
34546	34563	34542	34542	Enzo	256	“ You can have your own bedroom here . I ’ll clean out the guest room . ”
34580	34590	34574	34574	we	468	“ Is that . . . is that okay ? ”
34591	34608	34574	34574	we	468	“ Sure . I do n’t have many guests anyway . Will you need an office ? ”
34609	34619	34620	34620	I	1723	“ I can get along without a home office , ”
34623	34641	34620	34620	I	1723	“ Should I rent a truck or do you think we can get everything here in cars ? ”
34642	34673	34574	34574	we	468	“ I do n’t think we ’ll need a truck . It will mostly just be clothes and books . I ’ll leave my furniture and kitchen stuff for JJ . ”
34674	34682	34574	34574	we	468	“ Great . So Saturday , then . ”
34683	34686	34687	34687	I	1723	“ Saturday . ”
34693	34708	34687	34687	I	1723	“ What are we going to do about the , um , wedding night ? ”
34709	34715	34716	34716	Enzo	256	“ Oh yeah . That . ”
34719	34746	34716	34716	Enzo	256	“ Maybe you should plan on staying over here that night . I do n’t want people to see me dropping you off at your condo . ”
34747	34760	34687	34687	I	1723	“ Right . Okay . I’ll — I’ll pack an overnight bag . ”
34761	34765	34687	34687	I	1723	“ Sounds good . ”
34786	34794	34804	34804	he	538	“ So have you written my vows ? ”
34795	34803	34804	34804	he	538	“ I worked on them a little , ”
34807	34812	34804	34804	he	538	“ What about you ? ”
34813	34821	34823	34823	I	1723	“ I wrote a few things down . ”
34826	34838	34839	34839	He	538	“ I really can not wait to hear you say them . ”
34842	34860	34839	34839	He	538	“ Please remember that my guy friends are going to be there . Do n’t emasculate me . ”
34861	34869	34873	34874	his friends	539	“ I would n’t dream of it . ”
34892	34901	34886	34886	I	1723	“ But I have to tell you something . ”
34902	34905	34906	34906	I	1723	“ What ? ”
34911	34917	34906	34906	I	1723	“ I broke a rule . ”
34918	34928	34886	34886	I	1723	“ Let me guess . You told someone else . ”
34929	34934	34935	34935	I	1723	“ I ’m sorry ! ”
34944	34950	34951	34951	He	538	“ It just came out ! ”
34954	34959	34951	34951	He	538	“ Who was it ? ”
34960	34963	34906	34906	I	1723	“ Blair . ”
34964	34967	34968	34968	He	538	“ Oh . ”
34976	34984	34968	34968	He	538	“ Is she going to tell Griffin ? ”
34985	35003	34951	34951	He	538	“ She said she would n’t . She said he probably would n’t want to know anyway . ”
35004	35012	34951	34951	He	538	“ Yeah . I could see that . ”
35013	35035	34968	34968	He	538	“ Anyway , I apologize . If you want to tell one more person to make it even , you can . ”
35036	35052	35053	35053	I	1723	“ Nah . The fewer people that know this is n’t real , the better . ”
35063	35066	35053	35053	I	1723	“ Right . ”
35067	35083	34951	34951	He	538	“ And Cole told me Cheyenne knows . So we ’re even , I guess . ”
35084	35093	34968	34968	He	538	“ Cheyenne knows ? What does she think ? ”
35094	35122	35123	35123	I	1723	“ She has a twisted mind . She thinks it ’s romantic , like two people getting married so one of them can stay in the country . ”
35126	35133	35134	35134	Enzo	256	“ I suppose it ’s similar . ”
35181	35192	35193	35193	he	540	“ Well , I guess I ’ll hit the sack , ”
35196	35201	35193	35193	he	540	“ Night , Lucy . ”
35205	35210	35202	35202	I	1723	“ Night , Ricky . ”
35622	35629	35630	35630	Blair	1472	“ Then do it for you , ”
35633	35646	35630	35630	Blair	1472	“ Not everything has to be for a man . Pamper yourself ! ”
35647	35652	35653	35653	I	1723	“ I heartily agree , ”
36847	36853	36854	36854	he	1537	“ How do you feel ? ”
36857	36871	36854	36854	he	1537	“ Okay . I ’ll feel better after a few sips of that . ”
36973	36979	36980	36980	She	1472	“ monochromatic and somewhat cold . ”
37017	37020	37021	37021	he	1537	“ Shit , ”
37024	37034	37021	37021	he	1537	“ Was I supposed to wear a red one ? ”
37045	37054	37055	37055	Griffin	225	“ No dress code . You ’re good . ”
37074	37079	37080	37080	he	1537	“ Is this okay ? ”
37083	37104	37080	37080	he	1537	“ I was n’t sure how dressy we were supposed to be , and Blair was n’t home to ask . ”
37105	37110	37111	37111	I	1723	“ It ’s fine , ”
37115	37124	37111	37111	I	1723	“ This really is n’t a formal thing . ”
37125	37132	37133	37133	Beckett	1537	“ It ’s still your wedding , ”
37136	37144	37133	37133	Beckett	1537	“ That ’s a big fucking deal . ”
37145	37149	37150	37150	Griffin	225	“ No shit . ”
37158	37179	37150	37150	Griffin	225	“ I ’m still trying to wrap my head around it . You sure you did n’t knock her up ? ”
37246	37258	37259	37259	Griffin	225	“ For fuck ’s sake , Moretti . I was kidding . ”
37264	37275	37259	37259	Griffin	225	“ Lighten up . Married life is n’t so bad . ”
37276	37282	37283	37283	I	1723	“ It ’s not that , ”
37318	37323	37324	37324	he	1537	“ Let ’s toast , ”
37327	37335	37324	37324	he	1537	“ To Moretti finally meeting his match . ”
37348	37353	37354	37354	I	1723	“ It ’s fake , ”
37363	37366	37367	37367	Griffin	225	“ Huh ? ”
37373	37376	37377	37377	Beckett	1537	“ Fake ? ”
37405	37422	37401	37401	he	225	“ This wedding . The relationship . Bianca and me . It ’s just an act . ”
37423	37428	37429	37429	Griffin	225	“ What ? Why ? ”
37438	37442	37443	37443	he	225	“ Your dad , ”
37446	37450	37451	37451	I	1723	“ The company . ”
37454	37457	37458	37458	Griffin	225	“ Shit , ”
37461	37474	37475	37475	My	1723	“ Really ? You ’re marrying her just to get the business ? ”
37482	37494	37475	37475	My	1723	“ I have to . It ’s worth it to me . ”
37495	37503	37505	37505	I	1723	“ Does she know it ’s fake ? ”
37508	37514	37505	37505	I	1723	“ It was her idea . ”
37515	37518	37519	37519	Beckett	1537	“ What ? ”
37525	37530	37519	37519	Beckett	1537	“ Why would she — ”
37531	37538	37539	37539	Cole	81	“ Because she wants a baby . ”
37553	37557	37558	37558	Griffin	225	“ Holy shit , ”
37565	37571	37558	37558	Griffin	225	“ So she is pregnant . ”
37572	37597	37598	37598	I	1723	“ No , she ’s not . Not yet , anyway . But we ’re going to try as soon as we ’re married . ”
37653	37732	37646	37647	no one	1492	“ I ’m sorry , you guys . I wanted to tell you all right from the start , which was only about a month ago , but Bianca and I promised each other we ’d keep it to ourselves . As you can imagine , it ’s not something we want getting out . Especially to our parents . I only got to tell one person , and I drew Cole ’s name out of a hat . ”
37733	37743	37744	37744	Cole	81	“ I ’m glad you said something to everyone , ”
37750	37764	37744	37744	Cole	81	“ And if this is what you want , then we support you . ”
37765	37772	37773	37773	Griffin	225	“ Fuck yes , we do . ”
37781	37791	37773	37773	Griffin	225	“ Sorry if I was a little taken aback . ”
37792	37797	37798	37798	I	1723	“ It ’s okay , ”
37802	37842	37798	37798	I	1723	“ I know it ’s fucking crazy . But it ’s what we both agreed to do to get the things we want . And I have always wanted to be a father . That part is real enough . ”
37843	37851	37852	37852	Beckett	1537	“ And the marriage will be real ? ”
37855	37880	37852	37852	Beckett	1537	“ Yes . It ’s more of a business arrangement than anything else — we’re just friends — but we are really getting married . ”
37902	37907	37908	37908	Beckett	1537	“ Well , then . ”
37921	37925	37926	37926	Cole	81	“ To friendship . ”
37931	37935	37936	37936	Griffin	225	“ And fatherhood . ”
37941	37947	37936	37936	Griffin	225	“ And fuck the Mavs . ”
37948	37953	37954	37957	the rest of us	593	“ Fuck the Mavs , ”
38114	38143	38109	38109	She	1472	“ Um , remember that time you said you ’d help me reach the things I could n’t reach ? How about when the thing is the ground ? ”
38169	38174	38175	38175	She	1472	“ How ’s that ? ”
38184	38191	38175	38175	She	1472	“ Thank you , kind sir . ”
38219	38230	38211	38211	Gooseflesh	128	“ You look beautiful , Bianca . I mean it . ”
38231	38240	38211	38211	Gooseflesh	128	“ Thank you . You look very handsome . ”
38241	38244	38245	38245	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
38251	38257	38258	38258	She	1472	“ Shall we get married ? ”
38261	38265	38258	38258	She	1472	“ We shall . ”
38332	38339	38340	38340	she	1472	“ We have a few minutes , ”
38343	38353	38340	38340	she	1472	“ Do you think we should rehearse our vows ? ”
38499	38502	38517	38517	she	1472	“ Enzo ? ”
38519	38541	38517	38517	she	1472	“ Uh , let ’s not rehearse them . I feel like it will be more fun to surprise each other . ”
38542	38545	38546	38546	She	1472	“ Okay . ”
38552	38570	38546	38546	She	1472	“ Should we find somewhere to wait ? So we can make more of an entrance upstairs ? ”
38571	38574	38517	38517	she	1472	“ Yeah . ”
38583	38588	38578	38578	I	1723	“ Come with me . ”
38646	38653	38654	38654	Her	1472	“ I have something for you . ”
38659	38670	38654	38654	Her	1472	“ Enzo ! I do n’t have anything for you ! ”
38671	38676	38679	38679	she	1472	“ Just open it . ”
38688	38694	38679	38679	she	1472	“ Hold these , please . ”
38740	38749	38735	38735	Her	1472	“ Oh , Enzo , they ’re beautiful ! ”
38750	38757	38758	38758	I	1723	“ They were my mother ’s , ”
38761	38791	38758	38758	I	1723	“ My father gave them to her on their wedding day . They were his mother ’s before that — a gift from her father , the original Enzo . ”
38792	38803	38804	38804	She	1472	“ Oh my goodness , I ’m going to cry . ”
38812	38818	38804	38804	She	1472	“ It ’s too much . ”
38819	38833	38834	38834	I	1723	“ Do you want to wear them ? You do n’t have to , ”
38838	38850	38834	38834	I	1723	“ I figured you ’d be wearing jewelry already , but — ”
38851	38860	38863	38863	she	1472	“ Of course I want to wear them . ”
38876	38897	38863	38863	she	1472	“ These are no big deal . But can I put them in your pocket ? Blair has my purse . ”
38898	38901	38902	38902	I	1723	“ Sure . ”
38947	38953	38954	38954	she	1472	“ What do you think ? ”
38967	38970	38954	38954	she	1472	“ Beautiful . ”
38983	39005	38979	38979	Her	1472	“ Thank you , Enzo . I really love them , and I promise to give them back when — when — ”
39027	39044	39022	39022	I	1723	“ Let ’s not worry about that today , okay ? Today , they ’re yours . ”
39045	39048	39049	39049	She	1472	“ Okay . ”
39058	39061	39049	39049	She	1472	“ Okay . ”
39089	39095	39064	39064	her	1472	“ Here are your vows . ”
39096	39104	39108	39108	she	1472	“ Oh ! Let me get yours . ”
39141	39163	39138	39138	she	1472	“ Sorry . I had nowhere else to put them . I typed everything out and taped them to the card . ”
39164	39167	39138	39138	she	1472	“ Okay . ”
39184	39193	39138	39138	she	1472	“ And you ’ll go first , right ? ”
39194	39197	39198	39198	She	1472	“ Right . ”
39212	39219	39198	39198	She	1472	“ Why am I so nervous ? ”
39220	39231	39232	39232	Our	616	“ I am too . But we ’ll be fine . ”
39236	39269	39270	39270	She	1472	“ And listen , I just want to say thanks for doing this . It means a lot to me . I know you do n’t really want to be my wife . ”
39274	39300	39270	39270	She	1472	“ You ’re welcome . Thanks for agreeing to be my child ’s father . I know it is n’t what you ’d have chosen . ”
39301	39308	39309	39309	I	1723	“ That does n’t matter anymore , ”
39326	39349	39350	39350	She	1472	“ I ’m going to take care of you , Bianca . And the baby . I want you to know that . ”
39383	39425	39375	39375	Ellie	60	“ What the hell , you guys ? We did n’t know where you went . Judge Reinhart says you ’re up . Dad ’s waiting for you out here , B. Everyone else is seated up in the courtroom already . ”
39426	39431	39432	39432	Bianca	1472	“ Okay , sorry . ”
39438	39441	39442	39442	I	1723	“ Ready ? ”
39448	39456	39442	39442	I	1723	“ Ready . See you in there . ”
39484	39489	39490	39490	he	620	“ Still doing okay ? ”
39494	39499	39500	39500	He	620	“ A little sweaty . ”
39503	39525	39500	39500	He	620	“ I think that ’s normal . I guess I meant , are you still sure you want to do this ? ”
39570	39573	39574	39574	I	1723	“ Yes , ”
39981	39984	39985	39985	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
39993	39996	39997	39997	she	1472	“ Hey , ”
40184	40203	40204	40205	the judge	400	“ Now , I ’m given to understand the two of you have written some personal commitment vows ? ”
40208	40211	40212	40212	Bianca	1472	“ Yes , ”
40314	40319	40320	40320	she	1472	“ My dearest Enzo , ”
40331	40388	40320	40320	she	1472	“ You are the best thing that ever happened to me . I do n’t know why I was so mean to you when we were kids . I think now I was afraid of the way I felt for you . I had never met anyone so good - looking and awesome at baseball before . ”
40403	40472	40389	40389	She	1472	“ I ca n’t wait to spend the rest of my life ironing your shirts and cooking your favorite foods and watching you win the Allegan County Senior Men ’s Baseball Championship year after year . It is my dream come true . P.S. I wo n’t even care if you snore because it is such a manly sound . I love everything about you and always will . ”
40497	40504	40505	40505	I	1723	“ That was beautiful , sweetheart , ”
40518	40522	40523	40523	she	1472	“ Your turn , ”
40554	40599	40536	40536	I	1723	“ My sweet , brilliant , beautiful Bianca , what can I say but that my life before you was a meaningless , shallow void — in the words of the immortal Edward Cullen , it was ‘ an unending , unchanging midnight . ’ ”
40621	40698	40613	40614	Edward Cullen?—and	131	“ You have brought light into the egotistical and immature darkness that was my soul . I see now that you were always my one true love , and I was just too wrapped up in myself to commit to anyone else . But no longer . To sum up , again I quote Edward Cullen : ‘ No measure of time with you will be long enough , but we ’ll start with forever . ’ ”
40726	40740	40722	40722	She	1472	“ That was lovely , Enzo . Brought a tear to my eye . ”
40741	40746	40748	40749	Judge Reinhart	108	“ Well , then , ”
40752	40779	40748	40749	Judge Reinhart	108	“ By the authority vested in me by the State of Michigan , I now pronounce you husband and wife . You may kiss the bride . ”
40848	40863	40834	40834	We	645	“ Ladies and gentlemen , I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Enzo Moretti . ”
40979	40988	40968	40968	I	1723	“ Take good care of her , son , ”
41000	41006	40968	40968	I	1723	“ I will , sir . ”
41067	41074	41075	41075	he	224	“ Please . Call me Dad , ”
41085	41091	41075	41075	he	224	“ We ’re family now . ”
41092	41095	41096	41096	I	1723	“ Okay . ”
41100	41103	41096	41096	I	1723	“ Dad . ”
41168	41176	41177	41177	She	667	“ I ’m tempted to drop you . ”
41182	41193	41177	41177	She	667	“ I ’m tempted to kick you in the balls . ”
41272	41285	41286	41286	She	1472	“ Egotistical and immature ? What the hell was that all about ? ”
41292	41341	41286	41286	She	1472	“ Please . It was not worse than having to say all that nonsense about how mean I was , or how good - looking and awesome at baseball you are . Or that it ’s my dream come true to iron your shirts and attend your games . ”
41342	41350	41286	41286	She	1472	“ Who the fuck is Edward Cullen ? ”
41351	41362	41363	41363	she	1472	“ He ’s only the most romantic character ever written , ”
41376	41385	41371	41371	I	1723	“ Let me guess — a teenage vampire . ”
41386	41398	41399	41399	she	1472	“ Well , technically he ’s over a hundred years old , ”
41402	41432	41371	41371	I	1723	“ But yes , he appears to be a teenager . And Cheyenne and Blair thought it was very sweet that you quoted my favorite book during your vows . ”
41433	41440	41441	41441	I	1723	“ You quoted your favorite book , ”
41450	41466	41441	41441	I	1723	“ Will you relax ? Everything went fine , Enzo . We pulled it off . ”
41467	41471	41371	41371	I	1723	“ I guess . ”
41472	41487	41488	41488	I	1723	“ We ’re married , are n’t we ? Boom — phase one complete . ”
41506	41511	41512	41512	she	1723	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
41518	41521	41515	41515	I	1723	“ Nothing . ”
41522	41549	41550	41550	I	1723	“ Something is wrong . You ’re doing the thing with your finger on your chin , and that vein is popping out on your forehead . ”
41588	41596	41581	41581	I	1723	“ It was something your dad said . ”
41597	41612	41555	41555	she	1723	“ What ? That you could n’t return me ? I ’m final sale ? ”
41613	41630	41581	41581	I	1723	“ No . He called me son and told me to take good care of you . ”
41631	41634	41635	41635	she	1723	“ Oh , ”
41639	41654	41655	41655	I	1723	“ I said I would . And then he said to call him Dad . ”
41664	41671	41655	41655	I	1723	“ Well , that was nice . ”
41672	41718	41719	41719	Bianca	1472	“ Yeah , but it ’s all bullshit , Bianca . I ’m thinking like , in a year , this man is going to despise me . He ’s going to think I ’m not a man of my word . That bothers me . ”
41724	41774	41719	41719	Bianca	1472	“ Good grief , Enzo . You need to relax . This is n’t 1955 . I do n’t need a man to take care of me . My dad ’s just old - fashioned . And when we split up , I ’ll make sure he understands that . ”
41775	41782	41783	41783	She	1472	“ Still does n’t feel right . ”
41787	41802	41803	41803	I	1723	“ Well , it ’s too late now . We ’re married , Ricky . ”
41820	41823	41824	41824	she	1472	“ Hey , ”
41838	41920	41824	41824	she	1472	“ We knew what we were getting into when we made this deal . I know it ’s not conventional , but what is marriage anyway ? Maybe it ’s just an illusion perpetuated by Disney movies and romance novels . Maybe it ’s just a piece of paper . Maybe it ’s just an antiquated idea that reeks of misogyny and sexism — I mean , the bride ’s dad gives her away like she ’s a piece of property ! ”
41932	41939	41824	41824	she	1472	“ That seems kind of harsh . ”
41940	41985	41986	41986	She	1472	“ Do n’t get me wrong , I bought into the fantasy all my life . I was waiting for the handsome prince to decide on me , but he did n’t . He did n’t , Enzo . So I decided on me . ”
42003	42010	41986	41986	She	1472	“ But I need your help . ”
42011	42018	42019	42019	I	1723	“ I need your help too . ”
42034	42046	42047	42047	She	1472	“ Sorry , I do n’t know what my problem is . ”
42053	42134	42047	42047	She	1472	“ It ’s okay . Look , it ’s been a crazy week . Things happened fast , and our heads are spinning . You probably have n’t gotten much sleep — I know I have n’t . So let ’s go in and have a few drinks , eat some fried pickles , and celebrate our partnership with our friends and family . So what if it ’s not exactly the kind of partnership they all think it is ? ”
42135	42141	42142	42142	I	1723	“ Uh , about that . ”
42145	42157	42142	42142	I	1723	“ I kind of let the truth slip to my friends . ”
42158	42161	42162	42162	She	1472	“ Enzo ! ”
42168	42171	42162	42162	She	1472	“ Who ? ”
42172	42188	42189	42189	She	1472	“ Cole already knew , so really just two more people — Griffin and Beckett . ”
42195	42204	42189	42189	She	1472	“ They know to keep it to themselves ? ”
42205	42216	42162	42162	She	1472	“ Yes . And I trust them with my life . ”
42217	42223	42224	42224	She	1472	“ Then I will too . ”
42227	42238	42240	42240	Bianca	1472	“ So let ’s go face the music and dance . ”
42241	42246	42240	42240	Bianca	1472	“ You did what ? ”
42264	42280	42281	42282	My mother	256	“ We got you a night in the honeymoon suite at the Bellamy Creek Inn . ”
42285	42292	42293	42293	Enzo	256	“ It ’s your wedding present . ”
42442	42444	42438	42438	our	1671	“ Witchcraft ”
42556	42570	42571	42571	I	1723	“ We — we had n’t really planned on a honeymoon or anything , ”
42574	42583	42571	42571	I	1723	“ We ’re both so busy with work . ”
42584	42602	42603	42604	My mother	256	“ I know , that ’s why this is perfect . It ’s just for the night . ”
42607	42650	42603	42604	My mother	256	“ You ’ll love it . The package includes champagne and chocolates , breakfast in bed . . . I know you said you did n’t need time away , but you ’re newlyweds ! You need at least one special night . ”
42651	42656	42657	42657	I	1723	“ Gee , thanks . ”
42672	42689	42666	42666	Enzo	256	“ We ’ll , um , enjoy this . But you really did n’t have to . ”
42690	42703	42704	42705	my father	224	“ Well , you guys insisted on paying for your own wedding , ”
42708	42717	42666	42666	Enzo	256	“ It was the least we could do . ”
42718	42721	42722	42722	I	1723	“ Right . ”
42734	42752	42722	42722	I	1723	“ I ’ll be right back . I ’m just going to get another glass of Prosecco . ”
42753	42759	42761	42761	Enzo	256	“ I ’ll join you , ”
42768	42782	42761	42761	Enzo	256	“ Thank you very much for the gift , Mr. and Mrs. DeRossi . ”
42783	42787	42788	42789	my father	224	“ Ah ah , ”
42807	42814	42797	42797	Enzo	256	“ I mean Mom and Dad . ”
43000	43014	43015	43015	I	1723	“ So what are we going to do about this honeymoon suite thing ? ”
43021	43031	43015	43015	I	1723	“ That ’s one I did n’t see coming . ”
43032	43036	43037	43037	He	224	“ Me neither . ”
43040	43050	43037	43037	He	224	“ You could go stay there , I guess . ”
43051	43055	43056	43056	I	1723	“ By myself ? ”
43063	43093	43056	43056	I	1723	“ Do you know how fast it would get around town that I was staying in the honeymoon suite at the Bellamy Creek Inn alone on our wedding night ? ”
43094	43097	43098	43098	Enzo	256	“ True . ”
43195	43211	43187	43187	I	1723	“ But I feel bad . I do n’t want it to go to waste . ”
43223	43232	43212	43212	Enzo	256	“ Fuck it . Let ’s use it . ”
43233	43237	43238	43238	I	1723	“ Use it ? ”
43245	43252	43238	43238	I	1723	“ Like stay there together tonight ? ”
43253	43256	43257	43257	He	224	“ Yeah . ”
43260	43265	43257	43257	He	224	“ Might as well . ”
43266	43273	43238	43238	I	1723	“ What about the bed situation ? ”
43274	43279	43257	43257	He	224	“ What about it ? ”
43280	43289	43290	43290	I	1723	“ I think we need some additional rules , ”
43311	43314	43307	43307	Enzo	256	“ Okay . ”
43315	43329	43238	43238	I	1723	“ If there ’s a couch , one of us sleeps on it . ”
43330	43345	43346	43346	I	1723	“ Why ? You do n’t trust yourself to share a bed with me ? ”
43351	43355	43346	43346	I	1723	“ Very funny . ”
43356	43398	43307	43307	Enzo	256	“ Bianca , if you want me to sleep on the couch , I will . But I assure you , even if we shared the bed , your virtue would be safe . I can keep my hands to myself . ”
43399	43406	43346	43346	I	1723	“ Well , I can too . ”
43407	43419	43420	43420	He	224	“ So then we ’ll share a bed for a night . ”
43430	43439	43420	43420	He	224	“ Fine . We ’ll share the bed . ”
43447	43464	43420	43420	He	224	“ But no funny business . You stay on your side and I stay on mine . ”
43465	43477	43420	43420	He	224	“ Are you going to draw a line down the middle ? ”
43478	43482	43483	43483	I	1723	“ I might . ”
43488	43494	43483	43483	I	1723	“ And no sleeping naked . ”
43495	43503	43420	43420	He	224	“ Now you ’re just being mean . ”
43504	43510	43420	43420	He	224	“ How is that mean ? ”
43511	43556	43483	43483	I	1723	“ What if I always sleep naked ? You ’re making me feel ashamed . And the human body is nothing to be ashamed of , Bianca . In fact , mine is quite nice . I think you ’d enjoy seeing it naked . ”
43557	43564	43420	43420	He	224	“ I ’m sure you do . ”
43565	43574	43575	43575	He	703	“ I might even enjoy seeing yours naked . ”
43578	43585	43575	43575	He	703	“ Just putting that out there . ”
43586	43593	43594	43594	He	703	“ Ha ! Not a chance . ”
43599	43609	43594	43594	He	703	“ I had no idea how repressed you were . ”
43610	43639	43575	43575	He	703	“ I ’m not repressed just because I wear pajamas to bed , Enzo . You ’re just trying to trick me into letting you see me naked . ”
43640	43645	43594	43594	He	703	“ Is it working ? ”
43646	43649	43650	43650	He	703	“ No . ”
43655	43680	43650	43650	He	703	“ The least you could do is walk around topless or something , considering that I just began a yearlong dry spell for you . ”
43681	43688	43689	43689	I	1723	“ I think you ’ll live , ”
43697	43709	43689	43689	I	1723	“ Easy for you to say . You ’re a woman . ”
43710	43714	43715	43715	I	1723	“ This again ? ”
43720	43740	43715	43715	I	1723	“ Contrary to what men might think , Enzo , women crave sex just as much as they do . ”
43741	43755	43756	43756	Enzo	256	“ I had no idea you were craving sex with me , Bianca . ”
43769	43784	43785	43785	I	1723	“ But do n’t worry , I know how we can solve this problem . ”
43796	43811	43785	43785	I	1723	“ Do n’t even think about it . And get your paws off me . ”
43838	43841	43842	43842	he	703	“ Frosting , ”
43849	43858	43842	43842	he	703	“ Do n’t worry , I got it . ”
43896	43913	43918	43918	he	703	“ You made a mess shoving that cake in my face . Is it anywhere else ? ”
43926	43933	43918	43918	he	703	“ No . You look perfect . ”
44070	44074	44075	44075	Enzo	256	“ Everything okay ? ”
44115	44118	44119	44119	I	1723	“ Fine , ”
44129	44138	44119	44119	I	1723	“ You seem quiet all of a sudden . ”
44139	44145	44119	44119	I	1723	“ I ’m just tired . ”
44146	44150	44151	44151	He	703	“ Me too . ”
44154	44161	44119	44119	I	1723	“ Getting married is fucking exhausting . ”
44162	44170	44119	44119	I	1723	“ Having a baby will be worse . ”
44171	44174	44175	44175	He	703	“ True . ”
44178	44193	44119	44119	I	1723	“ Speaking of which , when do we go in for the first attempt ? ”
44194	44248	44119	44119	I	1723	“ I have an appointment with the fertility specialist next week . Because I do n’t ovulate normally , I ’ll have to take some preliminary steps to make sure we know exactly when it will happen , and then time the insemination right . There ’s a drug I have to take . ”
44249	44257	44119	44119	I	1723	“ What do I have to do ? ”
44258	44268	44119	44119	I	1723	“ Not much . Show up and get off . ”
44269	44278	44279	44279	he	703	“ I prefer provide a sample , please , ”
44283	44289	44290	44290	I	1723	“ Do n’t cheapen it . ”
44298	44316	44290	44290	I	1723	“ Just make sure it ’s a good one . We need the gold - medal swimmers . ”
44317	44328	44119	44119	I	1723	“ How dare you imply I have any other kind ? ”
44329	44334	44335	44335	I	1723	“ Speaking of which . ”
44345	44354	44335	44335	I	1723	“ What are you going to think about ? ”
44355	44358	44290	44290	I	1723	“ When ? ”
44359	44377	44378	44378	He	703	“ While you ’re , you know , providing the sample . What will you think about ? ”
44381	44391	44378	44378	He	703	“ Jesus , Bianca . I do n’t know . ”
44392	44396	44335	44335	I	1723	“ Porny stuff ? ”
44397	44425	44436	44436	I	1723	“ Probably . Am I supposed to think about the Holy Ghost or something ? Because I do n’t think that will result in my best work . ”
44426	44435	44436	44436	I	1723	“ It does n’t have to be religious , ”
44439	44452	44436	44436	I	1723	“ Just not anything too . . . you know , skeevy . ”
44453	44489	44436	44436	I	1723	“ What if your definition of skeevy is n’t the same as mine ? We ’ve never hooked up , so I do n’t know if you ’re totally vanilla or like a little kink . ”
44490	44496	44497	44497	I	1723	“ What kind of kink ? ”
44502	44513	44497	44497	I	1723	“ Any kind . Bondage , blindfolds , role play . ”
44514	44523	44524	44524	I	1723	“ I ’ve never done anything like that , ”
44562	44582	44557	44557	I	1723	“ I ’d be happy to test your limits — all in the name of research , of course . ”
44583	44591	44592	44592	I	1723	“ You know what ? Never mind , ”
44602	44617	44592	44592	I	1723	“ Think about whatever you want . It ’s really none of my business . ”
44691	44701	44681	44681	He	711	“ Want me to carry you over the threshold ? ”
44714	44730	44702	44702	I	1723	“ So you can threaten to drop me again ? That wo n’t be necessary . ”
44817	44860	44811	44811	Enzo	256	“ Oh , look . They left us a note . ‘ Congratulations , Mr. and Mrs. Moretti . Please let us know if there ’s anything we can do to make your stay more enjoyable . Cheers to your future . ’ ”
44869	44884	44861	44861	I	1723	“ Everyone ’s so happy for us . It ’s making me feel bad . ”
44885	44889	44894	44894	his	715	“ I know . ”
44929	44935	44936	44936	I	1723	“ But it ’s done . ”
44939	44944	44945	44945	He	715	“ It ’s done . ”
44951	44959	44945	44945	He	715	“ So now what do we do ? ”
44960	44966	44945	44945	He	715	“ I do n’t know . ”
44967	44975	44945	44945	He	715	“ The bar downstairs is already closed . ”
44976	44987	44945	44945	He	715	“ I ’m too tired to go back out anyway . ”
44988	44991	44992	44992	He	715	“ Same . ”
44996	45004	45005	45005	My	1723	“ Should we just go to bed ? ”
45010	45014	45005	45005	My	1723	“ I guess . ”
45015	45026	45027	45027	He	715	“ I ca n’t wait to get this suit off . ”
45075	45078	45079	45079	I	1723	“ Enzo ! ”
45082	45087	45079	45079	I	1723	“ Not in here ! ”
45088	45092	45069	45069	he	715	“ Why not ? ”
45093	45100	45079	45079	I	1723	“ Because I ’m in here . ”
45101	45110	45079	45079	I	1723	“ So go in the bathroom or something . ”
45111	45118	45119	45119	He	715	“ You go in the bathroom ! ”
45135	45170	45119	45119	He	715	“ This is my room too . And I do n’t have any hang - ups about my body . If you do n’t want to see it , close your eyes or something . ”
45365	45372	45347	45347	I	1723	“ Fine ! Be that way ! ”
45559	45562	45563	45563	I	1723	“ Yes ? ”
45570	45581	45563	45563	I	1723	“ You can come out now . I ’m decent . ”
45582	45586	45563	45563	I	1723	“ Define decent . ”
45587	45596	45563	45563	I	1723	“ All the scary man parts are covered . ”
45597	45609	45563	45563	I	1723	“ I ’m not scared of your man parts , Enzo . ”
45610	45630	45563	45563	I	1723	“ Oh no ? Then why ’d you hide out in the bathroom the moment I unzipped my pants ? ”
45631	45638	45563	45563	I	1723	“ To give you some privacy ! ”
45699	45715	45716	45716	He	719	“ But if you do n’t want privacy , fine . I ’ll come out . ”
45732	45741	45719	45719	I	1723	“ Want help getting out of that dress ? ”
45742	45748	45749	45749	I	1723	“ No , thank you , ”
45766	45774	45749	45749	I	1723	“ I ’ll just be a minute . ”
45775	45779	45780	45780	He	719	“ Suit yourself . ”
45847	45850	45851	45851	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
45854	45860	45851	45851	I	1723	“ I do need help . ”
45872	45876	45861	45861	He	719	“ Turn around . ”
45916	45920	45908	45908	I	1723	“ Thank you . ”
45921	45925	45926	45926	He	719	“ No problem . ”
46206	46209	46210	46210	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
46228	46231	46210	46210	I	1723	“ Hey . ”
46249	46256	46232	46232	He	719	“ For you , Mrs. Moretti . ”
46257	46264	46265	46265	I	1723	“ Thank you , Mr. Moretti . ”
46272	46281	46265	46265	I	1723	“ To the successful completion of phase one . ”
46282	46285	46286	46286	We	727	“ Salut . ”
46312	46327	46299	46299	I	1723	“ This probably is n’t what you pictured on your wedding night , huh ? ”
46336	46352	46328	46328	Enzo	256	“ Honestly , I do n’t think I ever pictured my wedding night at all . ”
46353	46356	46357	46357	He	719	“ Seriously ? ”
46360	46367	46357	46357	He	719	“ I take it you did ? ”
46368	46380	46328	46328	Enzo	256	“ All the time . Since I was a little girl . ”
46381	46392	46393	46393	He	719	“ Are you implying it did n’t look like this ? ”
46411	46418	46398	46398	I	1723	“ No . It did not . ”
46419	46433	46434	46434	He	719	“ So what did it look like ? Wait , let me guess . ”
46444	46470	46471	46471	He	719	“ A tall , strapping , dark - haired vampire carried you to his lair and penetrated you hard and deep with his steely fangs . ”
46492	46505	46506	46506	He	719	“ No , that ’s not what I pictured , you jerk . ”
46509	46514	46506	46506	He	719	“ So tell me . ”
46515	46544	46545	46545	I	1723	“ When I was little , he was Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid . As a grownup , I thought I ’d marry my ex - boyfriend , ”
46555	46568	46545	46545	I	1723	“ Oh , right . What was his name again ? Taint ? ”
46569	46572	46506	46506	He	719	“ Tate . ”
46573	46594	46595	46595	I	1723	“ Whatever . And what was it that Taint was going to do to make the night memorable for you ? ”
46602	46629	46595	46595	I	1723	“ You know what ? I ca n’t even name anything specific . It was just going to be the most magical night of my life . ”
46630	46656	46657	46657	I	1723	“ Magical ? Well , fuck . You were doomed to be disappointed , babe . There ’s no such thing as a magical dick . ”
46662	46694	46657	46657	I	1723	“ It was n’t his dick that was going to feel magical . It was the night itself . It was the things he ’d say . It was the mood . ”
46695	46700	46701	46701	he	728	“ Are you implying , ”
46707	46755	46701	46701	he	728	“ that the honeymoon suite at the Bellamy Creek Inn lacks mood ? We ’ve got champagne . We ’ve got chocolates . We ’ve got swans in the bathroom and pillows that say MR . and MRS . What could possibly be more romantic than that ? ”
46763	46769	46758	46758	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . ”
46770	46792	46793	46793	He	728	“ See , I happen to think this is perfect . I never pictured anything , so I ’m not disappointed . ”
46799	46817	46793	46793	He	728	“ Except for the no - sex rule . That ’s definitely a bit of a letdown . ”
46818	46848	46758	46758	I	1723	“ Well , I imagined sex too . And even if my groom did n’t have a magical dick , he would at least know how to use it . ”
46849	46853	46854	46854	Enzo	256	“ Oh yeah ? ”
46858	46865	46854	46854	Enzo	256	“ Tell me all about it . ”
46866	46873	46793	46793	He	728	“ No , you ’ll laugh . ”
46874	46883	46884	46884	He	728	“ I swear , I will not laugh . ”
46903	46912	46854	46854	Enzo	256	“ I want to hear your innermost fantasies . ”
46921	46948	46917	46917	I	1723	“ He ’d take one look at me and be completely unable to resist . He ’d want to ravage me completely . He ’d say — ”
46949	46971	46972	46972	He	728	“ Sorry , I have to interrupt for a moment . In this fantasy , are you wearing those exact pajamas ? ”
46992	47001	46980	46980	I	1723	“ You know what ? Just forget it . ”
47002	47018	47019	47019	He	728	“ No , no . I ’m sorry , go on . I ’m listening . ”
47034	47042	47043	47043	I	1723	“ Tell me what he ’d say . ”
47072	47111	47068	47068	his	728	“ He ’d say I was his one and only love . He ’d say nothing would ever come between us . He ’d say he could n’t wait to spend the rest of his life with me . ”
47112	47143	47144	47144	I	1723	“ Did he say , ‘ You complete me ? ’ Because I saw that in a movie once and I thought it sounded like something a chick would like . ”
47151	47162	47144	47144	I	1723	“ Just when I think you ’re not a pig . ”
47163	47168	47169	47169	he	728	“ I ’m sorry , ”
47174	47186	47169	47169	he	728	“ It ’s just that women and men fantasize very differently . ”
47187	47195	47196	47196	I	1723	“ Okay , so tell me yours , ”
47199	47219	47196	47196	I	1723	“ What would your wife say to you on your wedding night to get you all hot and bothered ? ”
47220	47223	47224	47224	he	728	“ Easy , ”
47227	47276	47224	47224	he	728	“ It ’s all one - syllable stuff like , ‘ oh , yes , God , right there , just like that , you ’re so big , do n’t stop , fuck me , harder’—I guess that ’s two syllables . But you get the gist . ”
47324	47334	47335	47335	His	728	“ Oink . Also a one - syllable word . ”
47342	47351	47335	47335	His	728	“ You do n’t like talking in bed ? ”
47373	47377	47362	47362	I	1723	“ Not much . ”
47378	47419	47362	47362	I	1723	“ See , I think a woman should talk in bed . I think she should say exactly what she wants and how she wants it . Otherwise , how ’s a guy supposed to know how to please her ? ”
47420	47426	47362	47362	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . ”
47427	47452	47362	47362	I	1723	“ Most guys probably figure if she says nothing , it all just feels good . And I bet that ’s not the case . ”
47453	47460	47461	47461	I	1723	“ That is not the case , ”
47464	47472	47461	47461	I	1723	“ Can I have the last chocolate ? ”
47473	47487	47488	47488	he	45	“ It ’s all yours . That ’s why you have to talk , ”
47492	47511	47488	47488	he	45	“ Tell the guy what feels good and what does n’t . He ’s not a mind reader . ”
47512	47522	47523	47523	I	1723	“ But what if I ’m shy about it ? ”
47532	47540	47541	47541	He	45	“ You ? Shy ? Come on . ”
47551	47561	47541	47541	He	45	“ Maybe as a kid , but not anymore . ”
47562	47583	47584	47584	I	1723	“ But I still find it difficult to be vocal about what I want in that particular situation , okay ? ”
47589	47602	47584	47584	I	1723	“ So how do you let the guy know what you like ? ”
47603	47620	47541	47541	He	45	“ I just sort of think really hard about it and hope he gets the message . ”
47621	47626	47627	47627	Enzo	256	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
47646	47688	47691	47691	I	1723	“ No amount of wishful thinking is going to bring you some kind of fairy - tale magic - wand dick that just knows how to make you come . Even I like a little direction . You want more champagne ? ”
47735	47742	47743	47743	He	45	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
47973	47976	47962	47962	I	1723	“ Hey . ”
47977	47980	47949	47949	she	223	“ What ? ”
47981	47987	47949	47949	she	223	“ I ca n’t sleep . ”
47988	48009	47954	47954	she	223	“ Me neither . I was about to jerk off , but I thought you might be mad about it . ”
48015	48022	47954	47954	she	223	“ What if I was n’t ? ”
48023	48026	48027	48027	He	733	“ Huh ? ”
48032	48038	48027	48027	He	733	“ That was a joke . ”
48039	48055	47954	47954	she	223	“ But what if I was n’t mad about it ? Would you do it ? ”
48056	48062	48063	48063	He	733	“ Hold on a second . ”
48078	48089	48090	48090	I	1723	“ What the fuck are you even saying right now ? ”
48098	48139	48095	48095	he	733	“ I do n’t know . I guess I was just trying to do what you said — talk in bed . Say what I want . You never said it did n’t count if I only wanted to watch . ”
48149	48155	48140	48140	Enzo	256	“ That ’s not funny . ”
48156	48162	48188	48188	MR	733	“ I ’m not joking . ”
48163	48175	48177	48177	he	733	“ Yes , you are , and it ’s not funny . ”
48204	48226	48140	48140	Enzo	256	“ You ’re just fucking with me , trying to make me hard so you can call me a pig again . ”
48227	48232	48233	48233	I	1723	“ I am not ! ”
48246	48254	48140	48140	Enzo	256	“ Did you take your pants off ? ”
48255	48261	48262	48262	he	733	“ I was fucking hot , ”
48265	48286	48262	48262	he	733	“ But I left my underwear on and I was n’t anywhere near you . I stayed on my side . ”
48287	48296	48297	48297	I	1723	“ I ’m not accusing you of anything ! ”
48303	48311	48297	48297	I	1723	“ Did I really make you hard ? ”
48312	48315	48316	48316	He	733	“ No . ”
48326	48335	48297	48297	I	1723	“ Me ? In my plaid flannel pajamas ? ”
48336	48339	48340	48340	he	733	“ No , ”
48343	48350	48351	48351	I	1723	“ I do n’t believe you . ”
48364	48370	48351	48351	I	1723	“ Give me that pillow . ”
48371	48377	48351	48351	I	1723	“ Stay back , Bianca . ”
48378	48388	48389	48389	I	1723	“ Come on , just give me that pillow . ”
48408	48412	48404	48404	He	733	“ Quit it ! ”
48413	48429	48351	48351	I	1723	“ What ’s the big deal , Enzo ? All I want is the pillow . ”
48430	48439	48404	48404	He	733	“ Well , you ca n’t have it . ”
48440	48444	48404	48404	He	733	“ Why not ? ”
48445	48456	48457	48457	My	1723	“ Because you do n’t want what ’s behind it . ”
48473	48478	48468	48468	I	1723	“ Maybe I do . ”
48479	48484	48468	48468	I	1723	“ Then prove it . ”
48485	48488	48489	48489	He	733	“ How ? ”
48499	48505	48506	48506	I	1723	“ Take off your pants . ”
48571	48574	48575	48575	My	1723	“ Shit ! ”
48581	48588	48575	48575	My	1723	“ I thought you were bluffing . ”
48589	48596	48597	48597	She	734	“ Well , I ’m not . ”
48611	48626	48575	48575	My	1723	“ I ’m into this , Enzo . For one night . Are you ? ”
48627	48633	48634	48634	She	734	“ What about the contract ? ”
48637	48651	48634	48634	She	734	“ How about we draft a . . . a verbal exceptions clause ? ”
48652	48665	48575	48575	My	1723	“ Like a wedding night exception ? Where we suspend the rules ? ”
48666	48669	48634	48634	She	734	“ Exactly . ”
48670	48676	48634	48634	She	734	“ And tomorrow it expires ? ”
48677	48692	48693	48693	I	1723	“ Sure . I think one night should be enough to satisfy our curiosity . ”
48698	48707	48693	48693	I	1723	“ Is that what we ’re calling this ? ”
48708	48716	48717	48717	She	734	“ Is n’t that what it is ? ”
48722	48749	48750	48750	She	734	“ I ’m curious about what you ’re hiding behind that pillow . And you ’re curious about how far I ’ll go to get it . ”
48774	48780	48768	48768	she	734	“ Your shirt . Off . ”
48806	48809	48810	48810	My	1723	“ Done . ”
48851	48855	48856	48856	she	734	“ Now you , ”
48932	48938	48939	48939	I	1723	“ Should I keep going ? ”
48957	48960	48949	48949	She	734	“ Yes . ”
49021	49040	49041	49041	She	734	“ So now that you know what was behind the pillow , what else are you curious about ? ”
49065	49085	49060	49060	I	1723	“ Uh uh . Not tonight , Mrs. Moretti . Tonight you have to say exactly what you want . ”
49086	49094	49095	49095	she	734	“ And you ’ll make it happen ? ”
49098	49106	49060	49060	I	1723	“ You ’ll do whatever I say ? ”
49107	49121	49122	49122	She	734	“ If it ’s humanly possible and it will make you feel good . ”
49145	49149	49150	49150	I	1723	“ Say it , ”
49153	49165	49166	49166	She	734	“ Tell me what you want , or this ends now . ”
49180	49248	49166	49166	She	734	“ I want to know what you ’d feel like inside me . I want to know what it ’s like to be with someone who puts me first . I want to feel beautiful , irresistible , like I ’m worth someone ’s forever , like he ’ll die if he ca n’t have me , like he ’ll lose his mind if I do n’t — ”
49249	49252	49253	49253	I	1723	“ Lucy . ”
49266	49280	49281	49281	She	734	“ Take a breath , okay ? Let ’s start at the beginning . ”
49341	49347	49348	49348	I	1723	“ Now let me think , ”
49356	49367	49348	49348	I	1723	“ What were my lines again ? Oh , right . ”
49383	49392	49348	49348	I	1723	“ You ’re my one and only love . ”
49417	49425	49405	49405	I	1723	“ Nothing will ever come between us . ”
49454	49478	49479	49479	She	734	“ And I ca n’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you — or at least the rest of tonight . ”
49490	49495	49479	49479	She	734	“ You paid attention . ”
49496	49502	49503	49503	I	1723	“ Of course I did . ”
49840	49844	49845	49845	She	1472	“ Oh God . ”
49850	49865	49845	49845	She	1472	“ That feels so good . I love your hands on me like that . ”
49880	49888	49889	49889	She	1472	“ Wait until you feel my tongue . ”
49989	49992	49993	49993	she	1472	“ Yes , ”
49996	50001	49993	49993	she	1472	“ Yes , what ? ”
50002	50020	50021	50021	I	1723	“ Yes , I want you to do that . I thought you stopped to ask permission . ”
50031	50039	50021	50021	I	1723	“ Did you ? That ’s cute . ”
50040	50043	50044	50044	Her	1472	“ Enzo . ”
50056	50060	50049	50049	Her	1472	“ Do it . ”
50061	50065	50066	50066	I	1723	“ Do what ? ”
50083	50090	50049	50049	Her	1472	“ Put your mouth on me . ”
50091	50095	50049	50049	Her	1472	“ Say please . ”
50096	50099	50049	50049	Her	1472	“ Please . ”
50338	50341	50342	50342	she	1472	“ Enzo , ”
50345	50355	50342	50342	she	1472	“ I want you to fuck me . Now . ”
50421	50449	50418	50418	I	1723	“ You ’re awfully impatient , Mrs. Moretti . I ’m still working my way through the script . I think now is when I tell you — ”
50581	50593	50574	50574	I	1723	“ I did n’t know this was part of the show , ”
50597	50602	50603	50603	Her	1472	“ I ’m improvising . ”
51014	51022	51023	51023	she	1472	“ You did n’t let me finish , ”
51036	51045	51023	51023	she	1472	“ Because that ’s not how this ends . ”
51060	51067	51023	51023	she	1472	“ Should I wear a condom ? ”
51068	51074	51075	51075	I	1723	“ Do you want to ? ”
51110	51113	51114	51114	I	1723	“ No , ”
51117	51122	51114	51114	I	1723	“ Then do n’t . ”
51131	51145	51114	51114	I	1723	“ If I got pregnant , it would save us time and money . ”
51146	51156	51157	51157	I	1723	“ I ’m definitely into saving time and money , ”
51168	51185	51186	51186	Her	1472	“ But mostly I just want to know what it feels like to be inside you . ”
51239	51248	51231	51231	she	1472	“ I want to make you come again , ”
51258	51263	51249	51249	I	1723	“ Talk to me . ”
51264	51269	51270	51270	she	1472	“ You ’re perfect , ”
51295	51327	51288	51288	Her	1472	“ Do n’t stop . I love the way you move . I love how deep you are . I do n’t have words for what it ’s doing to me . ”
51515	51520	51521	51521	she	1472	“ Are you okay ? ”
51617	51640	51614	51614	Bianca	1472	“ Your heart is beating really fast . If you go into cardiac arrest and die , do I get the house ? ”
51652	51658	51614	51614	Bianca	1472	“ Trying to kill me ? ”
51659	51674	51614	51614	Bianca	1472	“ Of course not . We have n’t even gotten to phase two yet . ”
51675	51678	51679	51679	I	1723	“ Right . ”
51690	51697	51698	51698	she	1472	“ I ’ll be right back , ”
51936	51944	51945	51945	she	1472	“ What ’s with the grumpy face ? ”
51971	51976	51958	51958	I	1723	“ I ’m mad . ”
51977	51981	51997	51997	she	756	“ About what ? ”
51982	51990	51991	51991	Her	756	“ That the sex was so good . ”
52005	52029	51997	51997	she	756	“ Oh my God , same . I was just in the bathroom cleaning up and thinking how pissed I am at you . ”
52030	52034	51958	51958	I	1723	“ At me ! ”
52035	52048	51997	51997	she	756	“ Yes . How dare you have the magic - wand dick ! ”
52054	52079	52080	52080	She	756	“ As much as I would like to agree , there was no magic involved , Bianca . You told me what you wanted . ”
52085	52092	52080	52080	She	756	“ I said like three things . ”
52093	52098	52099	52099	I	1723	“ They were enough . ”
52102	52126	52127	52127	She	756	“ I also think we just had some good chemistry . And there was a lot of . . . tension built up . ”
52130	52155	52127	52127	She	756	“ Yeah . That was the best sex I ’ve ever had . But I should n’t tell you that — you’ll get smug . ”
52156	52169	52170	52170	She	756	“ I was already smug from the magic - wand dick thing . ”
52177	52185	52170	52170	She	756	“ No more compliments for you tonight . ”
52186	52204	52127	52127	She	756	“ Hey , I earned them . Did n’t I do a good job with my lines ? ”
52205	52208	52209	52209	she	756	“ Yes , ”
52212	52221	52209	52209	she	756	“ A - plus work going off book . ”
52222	52232	52233	52233	I	1723	“ Speaking of A - plus work . . . ”
52237	52240	52233	52233	I	1723	“ What ? ”
52241	52245	52246	52246	She	756	“ That blowjob . ”
52249	52254	52246	52246	She	756	“ You liked it ? ”
52255	52260	52233	52233	I	1723	“ Um , yeah . ”
52261	52264	52265	52265	She	756	“ Good . ”
52282	52288	52289	52289	I	1723	“ Now who ’s smug ? ”
52325	52331	52320	52320	She	756	“ What are you doing ? ”
52332	52344	52320	52320	She	756	“ I do n’t know . I just like your mouth . ”
52345	52360	52320	52320	She	756	“ I bet you do . I let you put your dick in it . ”
52361	52370	52371	52371	I	1723	“ Hey , I liked it before that . ”
52376	52385	52386	52386	She	756	“ I just never said anything about it . ”
52395	52399	52386	52386	She	756	“ Why not ? ”
52400	52423	52386	52386	She	756	“ I do n’t know . Things just are n’t like that with us . We trade insults , not sweet nothings . ”
52424	52427	52428	52428	She	756	“ True . ”
52458	52472	52440	52440	I	1723	“ So that whole exceptions clause thing . When exactly does that expire ? ”
52473	52481	52482	52482	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . Midnight ? ”
52492	52505	52506	52506	She	756	“ Guess what ? It ’s only eleven - thirty - five . ”
52513	52521	52506	52506	She	756	“ You want to do it again ? ”
52522	52526	52506	52506	She	756	“ Why not ? ”
52527	52540	52541	52541	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . Because we already satisfied our curiosity . ”
52546	52557	52541	52541	I	1723	“ Sorry , but my curiosity is not nearly satisfied . ”
52558	52561	52541	52541	I	1723	“ No ? ”
52562	52565	52541	52541	I	1723	“ No . ”
52585	52603	52580	52580	she	756	“ For instance , I ’m very curious about what you look like as a reverse cowgirl . ”
52622	52630	52609	52609	her	756	“ Saddle up , Ricky . Yeehaw . ”
52634	52647	52648	52648	Bianca	1472	“ If you could have a superpower , what would it be ? ”
52699	52702	52703	52703	I	1723	“ Easy , ”
52706	52714	52703	52703	I	1723	“ I ’d want to read minds . ”
52715	52729	52770	52770	She	756	“ Oh my God , that ’s the last thing I ’d want . ”
52730	52769	52770	52770	She	756	“ Why ? It would make you so powerful . You ’d be able to outsmart any opponent , win every argument , know every pitch that was coming at you before you had to take a swing . ”
52775	52792	52770	52770	She	756	“ Life is not a baseball game , and some thoughts are meant to be private . ”
52793	52803	52809	52809	she	756	“ Okay , so what superpower would you want ? ”
52804	52808	52809	52809	she	756	“ Time travel , ”
52812	52826	52809	52809	she	756	“ So I could go back and undo a bunch of stupid mistakes . ”
52874	52885	52886	52886	She	756	“ Like bringing a book to that high school dance ? ”
52891	52900	52886	52886	She	756	“ No . I stand by that decision . ”
52913	52940	52903	52903	I	1723	“ Come here , selfish , I have to stretch my legs and you ’re taking up all the room at that end of the tub . ”
53050	53053	53054	53054	I	1723	“ So , ”
53068	53075	53054	53054	I	1723	“ It ’s definitely after midnight . ”
53076	53080	53081	53081	I	1723	“ It is . ”
53088	53098	53081	53081	I	1723	“ I vote we extend the clause until sunrise . ”
53099	53105	53054	53054	I	1723	“ I second that vote . ”
53106	53117	53118	53118	She	756	“ Then I believe it is unanimous , Mrs. Moretti . ”
53129	53136	53118	53118	She	756	“ That is so fucking weird . ”
53137	53150	53081	53081	I	1723	“ I know . Are you actually going to change your name ? ”
53151	53164	53054	53054	I	1723	“ I guess . It might look suspicious if I do n’t . ”
53165	53171	53172	53172	I	1723	“ I think you should . ”
53250	53267	53268	53268	I	1723	“ You know , all things considered , this has been a pretty good wedding night . ”
53271	53283	53268	53268	I	1723	“ Oh yeah ? Did I say all the right things ? ”
53284	53289	53307	53307	She	756	“ I think so . ”
53290	53306	53307	53307	She	756	“ You think so ? Give me something else . I ’ll work it in . ”
53319	53339	53307	53307	She	756	“ Hmm . Give me a line from Romeo and Juliet . Not the one about dying , please . ”
53340	53347	53348	53348	I	1723	“ Okay . Let me think . ”
53378	53384	53385	53385	I	1723	“ I ’ve got it , ”
53389	53394	53385	53385	I	1723	“ I ’m listening . ”
53395	53431	53385	53385	I	1723	“ O my love , I ’ve been really trying . Trying to hold back this feeling for so long . And if , perchance , you feel like I feel , then come on . ”
53432	53435	53436	53436	She	756	“ Enzo ! ”
53445	53456	53436	53436	She	756	“ That is not Shakespeare , that is Marvin Gaye ! ”
53457	53466	53467	53467	I	1723	“ But I changed it up a little , ”
53471	53479	53467	53467	I	1723	“ Made it sound fancy and shit . ”
53480	53486	53487	53487	She	756	“ You ’re the worst . ”
53507	53514	53487	53487	She	756	“ But you make me laugh . ”
53515	53527	53528	53528	I	1723	“ I ’m about to make you do more than that , ”
53545	53552	53539	53539	She	756	“ Let ’s get it on . ”
53785	53791	53769	53769	she	756	“ made the earth quake ? ”
53922	53927	53928	53928	she	1472	“ You ’re up , ”
53931	53936	53928	53928	she	1472	“ I ’m up . ”
53964	53970	53971	53971	she	1472	“ You ’re really up , ”
53983	53991	53971	53971	she	1472	“ I always wake up this way , ”
54012	54031	54032	54032	she	1472	“ Do n’t worry , I ’m not going to ask to play with your magic wand again , ”
54081	54084	54075	54075	I	1723	“ Good , ”
54147	54167	54130	54130	Bianca	1472	“ You do n’t have to hide , Enzo . I ’ve already seen what ’s under the sheet . ”
54168	54183	54184	54184	I	1723	“ I ’m not hiding . I ’m covering up . For your sake , ”
54192	54196	54187	54187	Her	1472	“ My sake ? ”
54197	54234	54235	54235	She	1472	“ Yes . I would n’t want you to get excited about something you ca n’t have . It would be like putting your favorite dessert on the menu but saying you ca n’t order it . ”
54238	54258	54235	54235	She	1472	“ I think I ’ll be okay . I had enough dessert last night to last me a while . ”
54259	54264	54265	54265	I	1723	“ You ’re welcome , ”
54990	54999	54981	54981	My	1723	“ Did you take care of your problem ? ”
55000	55021	54985	54985	he	768	“ I did n’t have a problem , Bianca . I had a hard - on . It went away . ”
55022	55027	55028	55028	I	1723	“ All by itself ? ”
55048	55051	55052	55052	he	768	“ Yes , ”
55130	55164	55121	55121	I	1723	“ Are you hungry ? I thought we could go down to breakfast in the dining room here before we check out . I ’m assuming we do n’t want breakfast in bed . ”
55165	55174	55175	55175	He	768	“ I ’m good with the dining room . ”
55187	55204	55175	55175	He	768	“ Unless you want to hang out in here and stare at my butt all day . ”
55227	55236	55237	55237	He	768	“ I was n’t staring at your butt ! ”
55240	55243	55237	55237	He	768	“ No ? ”
55244	55247	55250	55250	I	1723	“ No . ”
55254	55321	55250	55250	I	1723	“ I just . . . noticed it , that ’s all . It was right at my eye level . But from now on , if you would n’t mind not walking around naked , I would appreciate it . Despite what happened last night , this is still a business arrangement . I do n’t want us to blur the lines and get confused . ”
55322	55345	55346	55346	He	768	“ Ten minutes ago you said I did n’t have to hide behind a sheet because you ’d already seen me naked . ”
55393	55409	55384	55384	I	1723	“ I just want us to be clear that the rules are back in place . ”
55410	55434	55435	55435	He	768	“ Do n’t worry . We ’ll have our own bedrooms at my house , so my naked ass will not confuse you . ”
55454	55463	55464	55464	I	1723	“ Are we still moving me in today ? ”
55488	55493	55464	55464	I	1723	“ Works for me . ”
55494	55519	55520	55520	I	1723	“ Good . I ’m all packed up . Might take us a few trips , but everything is in boxes ready to go . ”
55548	55563	55540	55540	I	1723	“ I ’ll just blow dry my hair and then we can go eat . ”
55590	55609	55610	55610	Enzo	256	“ So what are the chances that we actually , you know , did the thing last night ? ”
55623	55629	55630	55630	I	1723	“ That we actually what ? ”
55639	55649	55650	55650	I	1723	“ Saved time and money . Completed phase two . ”
55658	55672	55650	55650	I	1723	“ Oh — you mean , what are the chances I got pregnant ? ”
55673	55676	55677	55677	I	1723	“ Yeah . ”
55686	55728	55677	55677	I	1723	“ I have no clue . Like I said yesterday , I do n’t ovulate normally . So I ’m never sure what my fertile days are . But if I had to guess , I ’d say slim to none . ”
55729	55761	55650	55650	I	1723	“ I do n’t really get that whole ‘ fertile days ’ stuff . So you ca n’t just get pregnant any time ? You have to wait for certain days ? ”
55762	55788	55789	55789	His	780	“ I mean , I think it ’s technically possible to get pregnant at any time , but it ’s unlikely . Especially for me . ”
55801	55823	55795	55795	he	780	“ But we did it like four times last night . I feel like I hit the target at least once . ”
55832	55857	55824	55824	I	1723	“ This is n’t like throwing darts , Enzo . It ’s not dependent on your skill level , impressive as it may be . ”
55858	55869	55876	55876	coyly	146	“ You were impressed with my skill level , huh ? ”
55870	55873	55874	55874	I	1723	“ Maybe , ”
55878	55904	55874	55874	I	1723	“ Certainly your stamina . Your enthusiasm . And the , um , size of your equipment . I definitely stand corrected on that count . ”
55915	55926	55934	55934	him	780	“ Thank you . I work well under a deadline . ”
55936	55945	55927	55927	I	1723	“ So you ’re saying it was work ? ”
55946	55959	55876	55876	coyly	146	“ Okay , I perform well under pressure . Is that better ? ”
55960	55963	55927	55927	I	1723	“ Marginally . ”
55964	56020	55927	55927	I	1723	“ Look , I was racing against the clock , that ’s all I meant . I kept thinking you were going to say time ’s up , clause is null and void , contract is back in place . I had to try to get my fill of you before you closed up shop . ”
56021	56026	55876	55876	coyly	146	“ And did you ? ”
56027	56034	56035	56035	His	780	“ Get my fill of you ? ”
56044	56049	56035	56035	His	780	“ Honestly , no . ”
56068	56074	56054	56054	I	1723	“ What are you saying ? ”
56075	56088	56089	56089	Our	781	“ I ’m not saying anything . I was answering your question . ”
56102	56109	56110	56110	she	782	“ And how are my newlyweds ? ”
56118	56121	56122	56122	Enzo	256	“ Good , ”
56131	56141	56125	56125	I	1723	“ So are you heading off on a honeymoon ? ”
56148	56154	56142	56142	Shelly	48	“ Somewhere warm and sunny ? ”
56155	56164	56165	56165	Enzo	256	“ No , Shelly , we are not . ”
56180	56211	56165	56165	Enzo	256	“ Believe it or not , I offered to take my beautiful bride anywhere she wanted to go , anywhere in the world , and you know what she said ? ”
56212	56215	56216	56216	Shelly	48	“ What ? ”
56228	56252	56220	56220	Enzo	256	“ She said she did n’t need fancy trips to exotic locales . Just being married to me was a vacation in itself . ”
56253	56256	56257	56257	Shelly	48	“ Oh . ”
56279	56287	56273	56273	she	256	“ Is that really what you said ? ”
56288	56293	56294	56294	I	1723	“ It ’s close , ”
56314	56320	56311	56311	Shelly	48	“ That ’s so romantic . ”
56321	56326	56327	56327	Enzo	256	“ Is n’t it ? ”
56335	56351	56327	56327	Enzo	256	“ What do you say , dumpling , should we finish up and get going ? ”
56357	56360	56327	56327	Enzo	256	“ Sure . ”
56361	56373	56374	56374	Shelly	48	“ Would you like to put this on your room charge ? ”
56377	56382	56383	56383	Enzo	256	“ Yes , please . ”
56390	56393	56383	56383	Enzo	256	“ Thanks . ”
56407	56414	56415	56415	He	48	“ What was that all about ? ”
56418	56433	56415	56415	He	48	“ Just keeping up the act . I thought hand - kissing was allowed . ”
56434	56459	56415	56415	He	48	“ No , not that . The thing you said . About . . . about not getting your fill of me last night . ”
56460	56465	56466	56466	Enzo	256	“ Oh , that . ”
56476	56486	56487	56487	My	1723	“ Yes , that . What did you mean ? ”
56492	56541	56542	56542	He	48	“ Exactly what I said . I did n’t get enough . If you were anyone else , and this was any other situation , we would n’t be down here eating breakfast right now . We ’d still be upstairs bouncing fake rose petals off the bed . ”
56548	56567	56542	56542	He	48	“ But rules are rules , and I understand why we have to put them back in place . ”
56568	56572	56542	56542	He	48	“ You do ? ”
56573	56606	56607	56607	He	48	“ Sure . It ’s like you said before , when my naked ass confused you , this is still a business arrangement . We do n’t want to blur the lines . ”
56615	56618	56607	56607	He	48	“ Right ? ”
56619	56622	56623	56623	I	1723	“ Right . ”
56634	56641	56623	56623	I	1723	“ That ’s what I said . ”
57112	57121	57106	57106	she	805	“ So ? How was the wedding night ? ”
57156	57161	57146	57146	I	1723	“ It was good . ”
57162	57170	57171	57171	I	1723	“ Elaborate please . Were there shenanigans ? ”
57188	57198	57202	57202	Blair	1472	“ There may have been a shenanigan or two . ”
57205	57210	57202	57202	Blair	1472	“ I knew it ! ”
57228	57234	57235	57235	She	805	“ What do you mean ? ”
57240	57272	57235	57235	She	805	“ After seeing you guys together at the reception , I bet Griffin fifty bucks you guys would n’t be able to stay in the same hotel room without messing around . ”
57273	57276	57277	57277	I	1723	“ Seriously ? ”
57280	57298	57277	57277	I	1723	“ Yes , except it was so obviously true that Griff would n’t even take the bet . ”
57299	57305	57235	57235	She	805	“ How was it obvious ? ”
57306	57324	57277	57277	I	1723	“ It just was . There ’s something between you guys that just , like , sizzles . ”
57336	57365	57366	57366	She	805	“ I ’m not even sure how it happened . One minute we were arguing , as usual , and the next I was taking off my pants . ”
57369	57379	57366	57366	She	805	“ Sounds about right . So was it good ? ”
57380	57385	57386	57386	I	1723	“ It was amazing , ”
57389	57424	57386	57386	I	1723	“ The man knows what he ’s doing . And he ’s not selfish at all , like I thought he would be . He ’s patient and generous and highly , highly skilled . ”
57425	57437	57438	57438	I	1723	“ Wow . So was it kind of like hate sex ? ”
57443	57476	57438	57438	I	1723	“ No . We laughed a lot . It was really fun . Then after the first time , we both said how mad we were that it had been so good . ”
57477	57485	57386	57386	I	1723	“ Why would that make you mad ? ”
57486	57501	57502	57502	I	1723	“ Because we were n’t allowed to do it again . But we did . ”
57509	57514	57515	57515	Her	805	“ Three more times . ”
57519	57535	57515	57515	Her	805	“ Even Griffin and I only managed to do it once on our wedding night . ”
57536	57579	57580	57580	She	805	“ That ’s different . You guys had done it before , and you knew you ’d have all your lives to do it again — as many times as you want to . Enzo and I just had the one night . ”
57584	57603	57580	57580	She	805	“ I do n’t understand . You ’re married . Why would you only have the one night ? ”
57604	57614	57615	57615	I	1723	“ Because sex is n’t part of our arrangement . ”
57626	57656	57657	57657	She	805	“ We agreed on that . We just sort of gave ourselves a wedding - night free - for - all . Now it ’s back to the rules . ”
57663	57681	57657	57657	She	805	“ So are you saying you ’d turn him away if he knocked on your door tonight ? ”
57682	57693	57580	57580	She	805	“ He ’s not going to knock on my door . ”
57706	57712	57713	57713	she	805	“ But if he did , ”
57716	57722	57713	57713	she	805	“ What would you do ? ”
57723	57731	57657	57657	She	805	“ Hmmm . Is he wearing clothes ? ”
57732	57740	57657	57657	She	805	“ Let ’s say he ’s shirtless . ”
57741	57754	57713	57713	she	805	“ Damn . Is his hair doing that thing in the front ? ”
57755	57768	57713	57713	she	805	“ Definitely . And he smells good . Like , really good . ”
57769	57777	57778	57778	I	1723	“ Ugh , that ’s so annoying . ”
57781	57805	57778	57778	I	1723	“ Ideally , I like to think I ’d be strong enough to be the first female in his life to resist him . ”
57813	57833	57834	57834	She	805	“ Realistically , though , I ’d probably think about it for two seconds , then jump his bones . ”
57839	57844	57834	57834	She	805	“ I knew it . ”
58086	58090	58076	58076	I	1723	“ Want some ? ”
58109	58113	58105	58105	He	225	“ No thanks . ”
58125	58130	58115	58115	he	225	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
58141	58155	58115	58115	he	225	“ My mother wants us to come for Sunday dinner tomorrow after church . ”
58156	58159	58160	58160	I	1723	“ Okay . ”
58163	58169	58170	58170	He	225	“ Is that a problem ? ”
58175	58196	58170	58170	He	225	“ Father Mike is coming . I think she ’s going to push us again about having the marriage blessed . ”
58197	58200	58201	58201	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
58210	58226	58201	58201	I	1723	“ I still feel weird about that . Since this is n’t a real marriage . ”
58227	58230	58231	58231	He	225	“ Same . ”
58260	58280	58251	58251	his	225	“ I ’ll think of some way to put her off . Want to watch a movie or something ? ”
58281	58284	58285	58285	I	1723	“ Sure . ”
58383	58387	58371	58371	Enzo	256	“ Everything okay ? ”
58399	58405	58371	58371	Enzo	256	“ Yeah . Just thinking . ”
58406	58411	58371	58371	Enzo	256	“ About the priest ? ”
58412	58419	58371	58371	Enzo	256	“ About my parents , actually . ”
58420	58425	58426	58426	He	225	“ What about them ? ”
58444	58461	58462	58462	I	1723	“ Their relationship is a big reason why I ’ve never really looked forward to marriage . ”
58469	58473	58462	58462	I	1723	“ Tell me . ”
58474	58567	58371	58371	Enzo	256	“ Basically , here ’s what I grew up thinking about being married to someone — it ’s noisy , frustrating , and sometimes destructive . There ’s a lot of yelling , and the things you yell loudest are the things you know will piss the other person off the most . You never let something go that might be used to pick a fight . And if you ’re not getting your point across with volume , just slam a door , throw some dishes , or threaten to leave . ”
58568	58571	58572	58572	My	1723	“ Wow . ”
58577	58588	58572	58572	My	1723	“ I had no idea your parents fought so much . ”
58589	58673	58371	58371	Enzo	256	“ They do n’t do it in public . And maybe it ’s not as bad as it used to be , but growing up , it was bad enough that I could not imagine why anyone would choose to get married if they did n’t have to . It ’s like you ’re handing another person instructions on exactly how to make your life a living hell , a map detailing where all of your buttons are and how to push them . ”
58674	58690	58572	58572	My	1723	“ Well , they must have had some good times . They ’re still together . ”
58691	58705	58706	58706	I	1723	“ Yeah . They ’re good at two things . Fighting and sex . ”
58717	58726	58727	58727	He	821	“ Sounds like another married couple I know . ”
58735	58744	58727	58727	He	821	“ Please . We are not my parents . ”
58745	58761	58762	58762	I	1723	“ No , we ’re not . And we ’re not my parents , either . ”
58774	58816	58817	58817	I	1723	“ My mother is completely subservient to my dad . She ’s never stood up to him a day in her life , even when I know she disagrees . It always drove me nuts . And I think . . . ”
58823	58886	58887	58887	He	822	“ I think that ’s why I get so mad about my last relationship . I ended up going along with what he wanted for way too long , just to hang on to him . Not that my father ever betrayed my mother — that I know of — but I never wanted to be that way . Timid and deferential . ”
58895	58909	58887	58887	He	822	“ Princess , you did not inherit a single subservient or deferential gene . ”
58929	58937	58924	58924	he	822	“ Why are your feet so cold ? ”
58938	58941	58942	58942	I	1723	“ Sorry . ”
58948	58968	58942	58942	I	1723	“ My socks got wet earlier , and I meant to go put on a new pair and forgot . ”
59023	59060	59019	59019	he	822	“ I guess my point was that I ’m glad we ’re doing things our way . I was always afraid of turning into them . It did n’t seem like a nice way to live . ”
59061	59064	59065	59065	I	1723	“ Same , ”
59077	59093	59065	59065	I	1723	“ Our marriage might be a sham , but at least it ’s not dysfunctional . ”
59094	59097	59098	59098	His	822	“ Right . ”
59143	59149	59132	59132	he	822	“ What should we watch ? ”
59267	59270	59271	59271	he	822	“ Night , ”
59275	59278	59279	59279	I	1723	“ Night , ”
59631	59634	59635	59635	she	827	“ Yes ? ”
59638	59644	59635	59635	she	827	“ Can I come in ? ”
59645	59648	59658	59658	she	827	“ Okay . ”
59674	59679	59680	59680	she	827	“ What is it ? ”
59688	59694	59680	59680	she	827	“ I was just thinking . ”
59695	59699	59658	59658	she	827	“ About what ? ”
59700	59707	59708	59708	She	827	“ About saving time and money . ”
59713	59716	59708	59708	She	827	“ Huh ? ”
59729	59768	59769	59769	I	1723	“ Saving time and money on the inseminations , like you said . Instead of paying for just one shot each month , we could just keep trying at home for free , as often as we want . ”
59781	59791	59769	59769	I	1723	“ Since we ’ve already done it and all . ”
59792	59797	59798	59798	Her	827	“ But . . . ”
59805	59811	59798	59798	Her	827	“ What about the rules ? ”
59812	59847	59769	59769	I	1723	“ I ’ve got it all figured out . What if we mutually agreed to suspend that particular rule in the interest of , uh , increasing our chances of success in phase two ? ”
59864	59891	59892	59892	She	827	“ I feel that phase two deserves a strong , proactive commitment and an innovative approach in order to . . . maximize opportunities for conception . ”
59895	59912	59892	59892	She	827	“ That ’s why you ’re in here right now ? To maximize opportunities for conception ? ”
59913	59924	59892	59892	She	827	“ Of course . What other reason would there be ? ”
59925	59931	59932	59932	She	827	“ I do n’t know . ”
59940	59945	59946	59946	We	833	“ You tell me . ”
59974	59985	59986	59986	I	1723	“ Okay , maybe I can think of another reason , ”
60017	60028	60009	60009	she	827	“ First you have to tell me what it is . ”
60035	60070	60071	60071	She	827	“ Look , I ’m offering you my superior genetic material — which is why you married me , after all — for free , whenever you want it . What ’s the problem ? ”
60076	60087	60088	60088	I	1723	“ That ’s not how this is going to work . ”
60092	60105	60088	60088	I	1723	“ Fine . I had a good time with you last night . ”
60106	60109	60088	60088	I	1723	“ And ? ”
60110	60119	60088	60088	I	1723	“ And I want to do it again . ”
60120	60123	60088	60088	I	1723	“ Because ? ”
60124	60130	60088	60088	I	1723	“ Because it felt good . ”
60131	60132	60088	60088	I	1723	“ Buuut”—she
60133	60154	60088	60088	I	1723	shrugged—“you could make yourself feel good all by yourself in your room . You do n’t need me for that . ”
60155	60158	60159	60159	I	1723	“ Fine . ”
60164	60172	60159	60159	I	1723	“ I enjoy making you feel good . ”
60178	60186	60159	60159	I	1723	“ Why ? Do you like me ? ”
60187	60192	60193	60193	I	1723	“ Goddammit , Bianca , ”
60196	60267	60193	60193	I	1723	“ You ’re such a pain in the ass ! I want you , okay ? Is that what you want to hear ? I knocked on your door tonight because I was lying in bed alone and I could n’t stop thinking about you . Now you can tell me to fuck off if you want to , but quit playing games ! Do you want me or not ? ”
60283	60290	60291	60291	she	1723	“ Yes , I want you , ”
60294	60301	60302	60302	I	1723	“ But I like playing games . ”
60317	60324	60325	60325	I	1723	“ You drive me fucking crazy , ”
60343	60360	60325	60325	I	1723	“ Like honest to God , you make me feel like I ’m losing my mind . ”
60373	60385	60363	60363	she	1723	“ God , she was right . You do smell good . ”
60386	60389	60363	60363	she	1723	“ Huh ? ”
60390	60407	60408	60408	she	1723	“ Never mind . I have decided I like your proposed amendments to our earlier agreement , ”
60417	60441	60408	60408	she	1723	“ Also your sizable assets and your willingness to be flexible . Shall we just call the orgasms a value - added experience ? ”
60448	60456	60442	60442	I	1723	“ Now that ’s more like it . ”
60612	60620	60621	60621	she	1472	“ Think we ’re expected at church ? ”
60628	60640	60641	60641	She	1472	“ Probably . And then at my parents ’ for dinner . ”
60644	60648	60649	60649	I	1723	“ Oh yeah . ”
60661	60682	60649	60649	I	1723	“ I suppose we could skip out . I do n’t think anyone would begrudge us a little honeymoon weekend . ”
60683	60692	60649	60649	I	1723	“ But the priest is coming for dinner . ”
60693	60718	60649	60649	I	1723	“ All the more reason to absent ourselves . My mother will probably try to make him bless us right over the chicken parm . ”
60719	60728	60649	60649	I	1723	“ Good point . Let ’s play hooky . ”
60729	60744	60649	60649	I	1723	“ What should we do instead ? What does your perfect Sunday look like ? ”
60745	60748	60649	60649	I	1723	“ Hmm . ”
60756	60764	60649	60649	I	1723	“ This is a pretty good start . ”
60765	60769	60649	60649	I	1723	“ I agree . ”
60770	60801	60802	60802	She	1472	“ And then there would be food . Waffles or something . Then I ’d probably curl up on the couch with a book and a blanket and some coffee . ”
60808	60813	60802	60802	She	1472	“ Am I boring ? ”
60814	60817	60818	60818	She	1472	“ Yes . ”
60821	60831	60818	60818	She	1472	“ What would you do with a rainy Sunday ? ”
60832	60850	60802	60802	She	1472	“ Honestly , I ’d probably get under the blanket and try to take your pants off . ”
60851	60863	60818	60818	She	1472	“ Are n’t you tired of getting my pants off yet ? ”
60864	60871	60818	60818	She	1472	“ Is that a real question ? ”
60872	60875	60876	60876	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
60895	60904	60905	60905	She	1472	“ Does it feel that way to you ? ”
60910	60934	60905	60905	She	1472	“ You said yesterday at the inn you were always hard in the morning . You said specifically it was n’t about me . ”
60935	60947	60948	60948	I	1723	“ That was a lie . It was definitely about you . ”
60966	60976	60905	60905	She	1472	“ Did you tell any lies at the inn ? ”
60977	60980	60981	60981	She	1472	“ Hmm . ”
60987	61008	60981	60981	She	1472	“ Yes . I lied when I said I was n’t staring at your butt . I was definitely staring . ”
61009	61015	60905	60905	She	1472	“ I definitely saw that . ”
61016	61023	61024	61024	She	1472	“ I could n’t help it . ”
61032	61040	61024	61024	She	1472	“ You ’ve got a great ass . ”
61041	61047	61048	61048	I	1723	“ The feeling is mutual , ”
61051	61076	61077	61077	She	1472	“ In fact , I once had this dream where I was chasing you through the house and you were only wearing an apron . ”
61080	61086	61077	61077	She	1472	“ Did you catch me ? ”
61087	61091	61024	61024	She	1472	“ Uh huh . ”
61092	61097	61077	61077	She	1472	“ What happened next ? ”
61098	61113	61114	61114	She	1472	“ I do n’t know . I woke up and had to jerk off . ”
61117	61128	61114	61114	She	1472	“ Next time we ’ll give it a better ending . ”
61213	61218	61219	61219	I	1723	“ What the hell ? ”
61227	61240	61241	61241	She	1472	“ I ca n’t find anything . Where is the rubber spatula ? ”
61246	61263	61264	61264	I	1723	“ Try the drawer to your left there . I had to rearrange some things yesterday . ”
61270	61275	61264	61264	I	1723	“ You had to ? ”
61276	61287	61264	61264	I	1723	“ I wanted to . Your system made no sense . ”
61288	61295	61296	61296	I	1723	“ It made sense to me , ”
61330	61345	61311	61311	She	1472	“ Sorry . Want me to draw you a map of where everything is ? ”
61346	61356	61357	61357	I	1723	“ Never mind . I ’ll figure it out . ”
61370	61390	61357	61357	I	1723	“ You know , I do n’t think I ’ve ever made breakfast for someone in my kitchen before . ”
61391	61394	61395	61395	She	1472	“ No ? ”
61409	61427	61402	61402	her	1472	“ Not like this . I ’ve never been big on sleepovers , especially at my house . ”
61428	61433	61434	61434	I	1723	“ I ’m shocked . ”
61440	61458	61459	61459	She	1472	“ Be nice , or I wo n’t say the cute thing I was about to say . ”
61462	61469	61459	61459	She	1472	“ What ’s the cute thing ? ”
61470	61480	61481	61481	I	1723	“ That I am genuinely enjoying having you here . ”
61487	61497	61481	61481	I	1723	“ Brace yourself — I think I like you . ”
61498	61501	61502	61502	She	1472	“ Ewwww . ”
61511	61517	61502	61502	She	1472	“ I know , right ? ”
61518	61528	61529	61529	She	1472	“ I suppose it could be an okay thing . ”
61538	61546	61529	61529	She	1472	“ Since we ’re married and all . ”
61587	61612	61613	61613	Bianca	1472	“ Hey , do you think we should adjust our written contract to reflect the eighty - sixing of the no - sex rule ? ”
61616	61635	61636	61636	She	1472	“ Um , I ’m not likely to forget sex is now on the menu . Are you ? ”
61639	61658	61636	61636	She	1472	“ No . And you were right — the more times we try , the better our chances . ”
61659	61673	61674	61674	I	1723	“ I ’m always right , babe , so get used to it . ”
61682	61700	61674	61674	I	1723	“ And just to let you know , I was really focused on the task this morning . ”
61701	61720	61721	61721	Her	1472	“ I thank you for your professional dedication , but do you have to call it a task ? ”
61725	61753	61754	61754	She	1472	“ Sorry . I ’ll call it target shooting — that ’s more like a hobby , right ? Or a sport ? An enjoyable leisure activity ? ”
61768	61809	61763	61763	I	1723	“ You know , if anybody had told me a year ago I ’d be married to Bianca DeRossi and trying to have a baby , I ’d have asked him what he was smoking . But here we are . ”
61810	61815	61763	61763	I	1723	“ Here we are . ”
61816	61823	61824	61824	I	1723	“ And you know what else ? ”
61836	61852	61824	61824	I	1723	“ Since we ’re friends now , I ’m going to tell you a secret . ”
61853	61856	61857	61857	Her	1472	“ Oooh ! ”
61862	61870	61857	61857	Her	1472	“ Yes , tell me a secret . ”
61871	61896	61897	61897	I	1723	“ I thought I ’d hate being married , but I kind of like it . It makes me want to do . . . ”
61905	61911	61912	61912	She	1472	“ Drastic and manly things . ”
61917	61926	61912	61912	She	1472	“ Drastic and manly things ? Like what ? ”
61927	61945	61946	61946	I	1723	“ Well , now that you laughed at me , I ’m not going to tell you , ”
61957	61973	61946	61946	I	1723	“ No , come on . Tell me . I really want to hear this . ”
61982	62045	62046	62046	I	1723	“ Okay . So ever since we said I do , sometimes when I look at you , I get this caveman instinct to throw you over my shoulder and growl at any asshole who tries to get close . I know it sounds possessive and sexist and horrible , because you are not my property , but you are my wife . ”
62049	62075	62076	62076	She	1723	“ And you can call me a pig , but I ca n’t help it if being a husband brings out that side of me . ”
62080	62103	62076	62076	She	1723	“ If I told you I kind of like it , are you going to beat your chest and make ape noises ? ”
62104	62108	62109	62109	I	1723	“ I might . ”
62130	62149	62119	62119	She	1723	“ So , hitting the target . . . This is one of your drastic and manly things ? ”
62150	62153	62154	62154	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
62168	62185	62154	62154	I	1723	“ Which means my ego is involved now , and when that happens — look out . ”
62186	62203	62205	62205	she	1723	“ Then this is one time when I actually hope to make your ego even bigger . ”
62211	62216	62205	62205	she	1723	“ God help me . ”
62268	62275	62276	62276	Beckett	1537	“ That ’s a new one , ”
62287	62297	62276	62276	Beckett	1537	“ I did n’t even know Griff could cook . ”
62298	62309	62310	62310	I	1723	“ I think Blair might have taught him some things . ”
62315	62329	62310	62310	I	1723	“ But I agree , he ’s definitely more domesticated than ever before . ”
62330	62335	62336	62336	he	1537	“ What about you ? ”
62353	62359	62343	62345	Bulldog Pale Ale	150	“ How ’s married life ? ”
62360	62367	62310	62310	I	1723	“ It ’s good , actually . ”
62368	62371	62372	62372	Beckett	1537	“ Yeah ? ”
62379	62382	62372	62372	Beckett	1537	“ Yeah . ”
62390	62407	62408	62408	He	1537	“ Turns out , I do n’t hate it as much as I thought I would . ”
62411	62421	62408	62408	He	1537	“ Maybe because it ’s only been four days ? ”
62422	62425	62426	62426	I	1723	“ Maybe . ”
62431	62446	62426	62426	I	1723	“ But it ’s probably because she gave up the no - sex rule . ”
62447	62475	62408	62408	He	1537	“ Wait a minute . There was a no - sex rule ? How the hell were you guys going to have a baby without having sex ? ”
62476	62481	62482	62482	I	1723	“ Do n’t ask . ”
62487	62535	62536	62536	Beckett	1537	“ She wanted to make it all complicated and do an insemination at a fertility clinic , but I convinced her it would be much more convenient , less expensive , and more likely to work if we just went about it the old - fashioned way . ”
62543	62546	62536	62536	Beckett	1537	“ Genius . ”
62547	62550	62536	62536	Beckett	1537	“ Right ? ”
62551	62565	62536	62536	Beckett	1537	“ And you ’re going to split up after the baby is born ? ”
62566	62569	62536	62536	Beckett	1537	“ Yes . ”
62570	62581	62536	62536	Beckett	1537	“ That might be tough . Do n’t you think ? ”
62582	62593	62594	62594	I	1723	“ I think we ’ll be able to stay friends , ”
62624	62632	62613	62613	I	1723	“ We ’re really getting along now . ”
62633	62640	62613	62613	I	1723	“ I meant on the kid . ”
62641	62644	62645	62645	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
62743	62754	62755	62755	I	1723	“ I ’m going to raise the baby with her , ”
62759	62770	62755	62755	I	1723	“ He or she will definitely have two involved parents . ”
62771	62776	62777	62777	He	1537	“ That ’s good . ”
62785	62791	62792	62792	I	1723	“ How ’s your dad ? ”
62822	62827	62828	62828	he	1537	“ Do n’t ask , ”
62831	62843	62828	62828	he	1537	“ I ’m sorry , man . Is it that bad ? ”
62844	62850	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ It ’s pretty bad . ”
62855	62911	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ And over the winter I was around more to keep an eye on him , but pretty soon the days will get longer , and I ’ll be out of the house from sunup until sundown . He ’ll need constant supervision , whether he likes it or not — and he will not . ”
62912	62919	62928	62928	Beckett	1537	“ I thought you hired someone . ”
62920	62927	62928	62928	Beckett	1537	“ I ’ve hired three people , ”
62944	63002	63003	63003	I	1723	“ He fires them all as soon as I leave the house . And even when I tell the caregivers he does n’t have the authority to do that , he ’s such an asshole , they want to quit . He just has no filter anymore . He told one she had a face for radio . ”
63006	63016	63003	63003	I	1723	“ Sorry , I know it ’s not funny . ”
63017	63042	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ He also thinks he ’s a Major League ball player now . He ’s always talking about having to get to his games . ”
63043	63051	63003	63003	I	1723	“ Well , that seems harmless enough . ”
63052	63091	63003	63003	I	1723	“ Not to me , it does n’t . I ’m trying to keep him grounded in reality . And all he does is fight me , lie to me , or accuse me of stealing his things . ”
63092	63096	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ What things ? ”
63097	63114	63003	63003	I	1723	“ Oh , you name it . His baseball uniform , his money , his car . ”
63115	63123	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ Can I do anything to help ? ”
63124	63144	63145	63145	He	850	“ Nah . I ’ll figure it out . I just have a lot to deal with right now . ”
63151	63157	63145	63145	He	850	“ You remember Maddie Blake ? ”
63163	63170	63171	63171	He	850	“ The one that got away ? ”
63174	63183	63171	63171	He	850	“ Fuck off , we were just friends . ”
63184	63192	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ She was always at your house . ”
63193	63215	63171	63171	He	850	“ Because she lived across the road and we had classes together . We did homework at my house , asshole . ”
63216	63227	63171	63171	He	850	“ Fine , but you still wanted to bang her . ”
63228	63239	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ Yeah , well , she had a jerk boyfriend . ”
63251	63263	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ Did n’t you kick his ass at the prom afterparty ? ”
63272	63275	62851	62851	Beckett	1537	“ Yeah . ”
63276	63305	63312	63312	He	1537	“ Dude , that ’s the maddest I ’ve ever seen you get . I thought for sure you were gon na knock that guy ’s teeth out . ”
63306	63311	63312	63312	He	1537	“ I should have . ”
63317	63348	63312	63312	He	1537	“ He was such a dick to her . But he was so drunk , it was n’t even fair . She begged me not to bust up his face . ”
63349	63359	63360	63360	Beckett	1537	“ I ca n’t even remember what started it . ”
63363	63389	63360	63360	Beckett	1537	“ She asked me to drive her home because he was drinking so much . I was walking her out when he came after me . ”
63390	63398	63399	63399	I	1723	“ Oh yeah . Now I remember . ”
63555	63570	63543	63543	Beckett	1537	“ That ’s the only time I ever saw you get in a fight . ”
63571	63579	63580	63580	Chest	153	“ Was n’t much of a fight . ”
63592	63604	63584	63584	Beckett	1537	“ True . So you ’ve kept in touch with Maddie ? ”
63605	63647	63648	63648	He	1537	“ For a while , when we first went away to college . Then her mom died , and out of nowhere , she dropped out of school and got married . I did n’t hear from her for a while . ”
63655	63675	63648	63648	He	1537	“ But while I was living in Manhattan , she came and stayed with me for a few days . ”
63676	63679	63584	63584	Beckett	1537	“ Really ? ”
63687	63694	63695	63695	He	1537	“ Did anything happen between you ? ”
63700	63732	63695	63695	He	1537	“ She was still married . And actually , she was pregnant . She ended up going back to him , even though I tried to talk her out of it . ”
63733	63740	63741	63741	His	1537	“ Why ’d you do that ? ”
63745	63753	63741	63741	His	1537	“ Because he did n’t deserve her . ”
63754	63759	63695	63695	He	1537	“ Was he abusive ? ”
63760	63780	63741	63741	His	1537	“ Not physically . He was just a jerk . They ended up getting divorced about a year ago . ”
63781	63790	63741	63741	His	1537	“ So now she ’s a single mom ? ”
63791	63807	63695	63695	He	1537	“ Yeah . She ’s got a six - year - old son , Elliott . ”
63808	63811	63812	63812	I	1723	“ Huh . ”
63819	63838	63839	63839	Beckett	1537	“ Does she live around here ? I do n’t think I ’ve seen her since high school . ”
63844	63896	63839	63839	Beckett	1537	“ She lives in Ohio , but she ’s coming up here in a few weeks to sell the house she grew up in . Her mom left it to her , and she ’s been renting it out . Actually , I was going to ask a favor of you . ”
63897	63904	63943	63943	He	1537	“ Sure . What is it ? ”
63905	63942	63943	63943	He	1537	“ Could you maybe take a look at this house and give her an estimate on some improvements ? The property manager neglected to do any maintenance , and it ’s been vacant for a while . ”
63946	63964	63965	63965	I	1723	“ I ’ve looked at it from the outside , and it ’s in pretty bad shape . ”
63970	63979	63965	63965	I	1723	“ I can do that . No problem . ”
63980	63991	63992	63992	Beckett	1537	“ I do n’t know how much money she has , ”
64002	64028	63992	63992	Beckett	1537	“ I ’ll take a look and see what we ’re dealing with . Do n’t worry , I ’ll give her a good price . ”
64029	64037	64038	64038	Beckett	1537	“ That ’s what I told her . ”
64048	64053	64038	64038	Beckett	1537	“ Thanks , man . ”
64054	64066	63992	63992	Beckett	1537	“ Is she going to stay there until it ’s sold ? ”
64067	64078	64079	64079	I	1723	“ Actually , she ’s going to stay with me . ”
64086	64094	64095	64095	he	1537	“ She was going to stay there , ”
64105	64144	64095	64095	he	1537	“ but that place is a wreck . I do n’t think she realizes how bad it is . We ’ve got plenty of room , and she said her son is really excited about visiting a farm . ”
64145	64158	64159	64159	I	1723	“ Well , there you go , you can finally bang her , ”
64167	64184	64162	64162	He	1537	“ Fuck off , asshole . I ’m just doing something nice for an old friend . ”
64232	64245	64230	64230	her	152	“ She ’ll be here in a few weeks , you said ? ”
64246	64274	64275	64275	I	1723	“ Yes , as soon as Elliott is out of school for the summer . I ’ll let you know as soon as I hear from her . ”
64280	64289	64275	64275	I	1723	“ You do have a lot going on . ”
64290	64315	64230	64230	her	152	“ Tell me about it . I ’m gon na wake up with white hair one of these mornings , just like my dad . ”
64316	64337	64338	64338	He	1537	“ My advice is to get a fake wife and have lots of sex . It ’s excellent stress relief . ”
64341	64385	64338	64338	He	1537	“ A wife is the last thing I need , fake or otherwise . I ’ve got enough people to take care of right now , not to mention a herd of cattle , some goats , chickens , horses , a dog — ”
64386	64391	64392	64392	I	1723	“ Okay , okay . ”
64400	64415	64392	64392	I	1723	“ You win . No wife . How about I buy the next round ? ”
64424	64427	64416	64416	Beckett	1537	“ Sold . ”
64465	64506	64507	64507	Bianca	1472	“ Hey , if I ever lose my mind and start wandering around town babbling nonsense , do n’t let our kid feel responsible . Put me in a home or something . Just make sure they have good food . ”
64516	64519	64507	64507	Bianca	1472	“ What ? ”
64520	64535	64536	64536	I	1723	“ Beckett ’s dad has dementia , and Beckett has to deal with it . ”
64563	64567	64568	64568	Bianca	1472	“ Poor Beckett , ”
64596	64605	64586	64586	she	1472	“ Yeah , I feel bad for him . ”
64606	64613	64586	64586	she	1472	“ When did his mom die ? ”
64614	64643	64586	64586	she	1472	“ She did n’t die — that I know of , anyway . She just took off when Beck was really young . He never talked about it . ”
64644	64653	64586	64586	she	1472	“ Poor thing . Does he have siblings ? ”
64654	64678	64586	64586	she	1472	“ He has two older sisters , Mallory and Amy . But they do n’t live close enough to help out every day . ”
64679	64685	64586	64586	she	1472	“ Does Beckett ever date ? ”
64686	64729	64730	64730	I	1723	“ I think he had a girlfriend for a while in New York , but since he moved back here , there has n’t been anyone serious . He ’s always so busy with the ranch , and now with his dad . ”
64745	64772	64730	64730	I	1723	“ In high school , he was always hung up on this one girl — Maddie Blake . Not that he ’d ever admit to it . ”
64773	64776	64586	64586	she	1472	“ Yeah ? ”
64777	64809	64810	64810	Bianca	1472	“ She lived across the road from the ranch and they had classes together , so she hung around his house a lot , although he claims they only did homework . ”
64813	64832	64810	64810	Bianca	1472	“ Which you can not imagine doing , if you were alone with a girl in high school . ”
64833	64836	64837	64837	I	1723	“ Precisely . ”
64845	64874	64837	64837	I	1723	“ But actually , I believe him . She had a boyfriend , and Beckett was not the kind of guy to go after someone else ’s girlfriend . ”
64875	64883	64730	64730	I	1723	“ What was he like back then ? ”
64884	64939	64837	64837	I	1723	“ Pretty much the same as he is now . A workaholic . Crazy smart . An awesome athlete . Busy all the time . When he was n’t at school or practice , he was working . He used to get up at fucking five a.m. and milk cows before coming to school . ”
64940	64947	64837	64837	I	1723	“ He never had a girlfriend ? ”
64948	64964	64730	64730	I	1723	“ Not really . I think he was always hung up on that Maddie girl . ”
64965	64972	64837	64837	I	1723	“ And he never told her ? ”
64973	64980	64837	64837	I	1723	“ Nope . Not his style . ”
64981	64987	64730	64730	I	1723	“ What was she like ? ”
64988	65007	65008	65008	I	1723	“ She was nice . Pretty , but not in a super showy way . Kind of quiet . ”
65012	65028	65029	65029	Bianca	1472	“ Everyone liked her , but she only dated losers — I never understood it . ”
65032	65045	65029	65029	Bianca	1472	“ You never know what ’s going on in someone ’s head . ”
65046	65091	65092	65092	I	1723	“ I guess . Anyway , Beckett said she eventually married a loser and had a kid with him . But she ’s divorced now , and she ’d coming back here in a couple weeks to sell the house she grew up in . ”
65119	65127	65128	65128	She	1472	“ Aww . Of course you did . ”
65133	65140	65128	65128	She	1472	“ You ’re a good friend . ”
65141	65148	65149	65149	Bianca	1472	“ Beckett ’s a good guy . ”
65155	65180	65149	65149	Bianca	1472	“ Hard to believe a mom could just abandon their child like his mother did , but . . . I guess it happens . ”
65181	65184	65128	65128	She	1472	“ Yeah . ”
65185	65205	65206	65206	I	1723	“ As intense as our parents can be , we ’re lucky we grew up the way we did . ”
65239	65247	65248	65248	I	1723	“ Let me up for a second , ”
65252	65258	65259	65259	She	1472	“ I need to stretch . ”
65280	65284	65285	65285	she	1472	“ You okay ? ”
65288	65304	65285	65285	she	1472	“ I ’m fine . I must have hurt myself at the gym this morning . ”
65344	65357	65358	65358	I	1723	“ Do you think we ’re going to fuck up our kid ? ”
65361	65366	65367	65367	She	1472	“ What ? No . ”
65371	65378	65367	65367	She	1472	“ Why would you say that ? ”
65379	65390	65367	65367	She	1472	“ Because we ’re not going to raise it together . ”
65391	65397	65367	65367	She	1472	“ Yes , we are . ”
65398	65409	65367	65367	She	1472	“ You know what I mean — in one house . ”
65410	65413	65414	65414	She	1472	“ Oh . ”
65421	65458	65414	65414	She	1472	“ No , I do n’t think we ’re going to fuck up our kid . Plenty of children grow up in two different households . The important thing is that they know they ’re loved . ”
65475	65489	65490	65490	she	1472	“ Are you — are you changing your mind about having a baby ? ”
65494	65497	65498	65498	I	1723	“ No . ”
65506	65535	65498	65498	I	1723	“ No , I ’m still good with the plan . Sorry , I think I ’m just worried about Beckett , and it ’s fucking with me . ”
65536	65544	65545	65545	She	1472	“ That ’s okay . I understand . ”
65568	65578	65498	65498	I	1723	“ Hey . What are you doing over there ? ”
65579	65592	65606	65606	She	1472	“ I do n’t know . I ’m giving you some space . ”
65593	65605	65606	65606	She	1472	“ Well , I do n’t want it . Come here . ”
65620	65646	65647	65647	Her	1472	“ I just want you to know , and I mean this with one hundred percent sincerity , I ’m not sick of you yet . ”
65657	65667	65647	65647	Her	1472	“ I ’m not sick of you yet either . ”
65668	65673	65674	65674	I	1723	“ Okay . Good . ”
65714	65722	65723	65723	Cheyenne	1472	“ I ’m dying to catch up , ”
65751	65757	65743	65743	I	1723	“ How are things going ? ”
65758	65761	65762	65762	I	1723	“ Good , ”
65765	65774	65776	65776	Blair	1472	“ I noticed you ’re not drinking wine , ”
65802	65805	65794	65794	I	1723	“ Nope . ”
65806	65815	65816	65816	Cheyenne	1472	“ Does that mean you ’re already pregnant ? ”
65821	65824	65825	65825	I	1723	“ No , ”
65830	65836	65825	65825	I	1723	“ Just trying to be . ”
65843	65870	65837	65837	Blair	1472	“ Wait a minute . You told me before that the first insemination would n’t be until late April . It ’s only mid - March . ”
65871	65875	65876	65876	I	1723	“ About that . ”
65883	65898	65876	65876	I	1723	“ We , um , decided to try it the old - fashioned way . ”
65906	65911	65912	65912	Cheyenne	1472	“ Are you serious ? ”
65915	65918	65912	65912	Cheyenne	1472	“ Yes . ”
65919	65924	65925	65925	Blair	1472	“ I knew it ! ”
65933	65962	65925	65925	Blair	1472	“ I said to Griffin when we left your house on Saturday that you guys would not be able to stick to that ridiculous no - sex rule . ”
65963	65968	65969	65969	I	1723	“ You were right , ”
65972	65977	65969	65969	I	1723	“ We could n’t . ”
65978	65984	65985	65985	Cheyenne	1472	“ I ’m so confused , ”
65995	66010	65985	65985	Cheyenne	1472	“ Are you guys actually a couple now ? Or is everything still fake ? ”
66011	66020	66021	66021	I	1723	“ I think we ’re something in between , ”
66024	66041	66042	66042	She	1472	“ Not a couple , but not entirely fake either . More like friends with benefits . ”
66048	66059	66042	66042	She	1472	“ But you ’re still planning to break up eventually ? ”
66060	66080	65985	65985	Cheyenne	1472	“ Yes . After the baby is born , if I get pregnant . Sooner if I do n’t . ”
66081	66086	66042	66042	She	1472	“ Like how soon ? ”
66087	66097	66098	66098	My	1723	“ We said we ’d give it three months . ”
66129	66132	66133	66133	Cheyenne	1472	“ Wow . ”
66136	66147	66133	66133	Cheyenne	1472	“ And you ’ll be able to just walk away ? ”
66148	66151	66152	66152	I	1723	“ Sure , ”
66162	66198	66152	66152	I	1723	“ That part of the plan has n’t changed . From the very beginning , we agreed on an expiration date . We just adjusted things to have a little more fun in the meantime . ”
66199	66211	66212	66212	Cheyenne	1472	“ But what if you really like each other by then ? ”
66215	66224	66212	66212	Cheyenne	1472	“ Do n’t you think it could work ? ”
66225	66229	66230	66230	I	1723	“ No way , ”
66252	66287	66212	66212	Cheyenne	1472	“ The reason I chose Enzo is because I knew there would be no possible way I ’d ever fall for him . In fact , he made me put that in the contract . ”
66288	66292	66293	66293	Cheyenne	1472	“ He did ? ”
66298	66303	66293	66293	Cheyenne	1472	“ What an asshole . ”
66304	66308	66309	66309	I	1723	“ I know . ”
66316	66361	66309	66309	I	1723	“ And at the time , it seemed ludicrous that he ’d even think it . But he claims he ’s been in this situation before , where someone says she ’s okay with casual fun but then she falls in love with him . ”
66362	66370	66371	66371	Blair	1472	“ But you ’re not that girl , ”
66374	66381	66371	66371	Blair	1472	“ This is not that situation . ”
66382	66395	66396	66396	I	1723	“ No , it ’s not . And it never will be . ”
66403	66450	66451	66451	Blair	1472	“ Look , I appreciate his honesty . I spent years in a relationship letting myself be strung along with empty promises . At least Enzo is being up front about it . He ’s never going to love me . I ’m okay with that . ”
66458	66465	66451	66451	Blair	1472	“ She sounds just like you . ”
66466	66469	66470	66470	I	1723	“ Huh ? ”
66478	66487	66488	66488	Cheyenne	1472	“ I said that too , about Cole . ”
66492	66502	66488	66488	Cheyenne	1472	“ That he was never going to love me . ”
66503	66506	66507	66507	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
66516	66535	66507	66507	I	1723	“ Well , that was a different situation . You guys had a different history . Different circumstances . ”
66536	66543	66545	66545	Blair	1472	“ So did Griffin and I , ”
66547	66598	66545	66545	Blair	1472	“ There is n’t one path that leads to love , Bianca . All we ’re saying is that we do n’t think you should completely close yourself off to the idea of finding something real with Enzo . It could happen , even though neither of you expects it . ”
66599	66606	66607	66607	I	1723	“ Neither of us wants it , ”
66635	66745	66746	66746	Blair	1472	“ We ’re in this for something else entirely . And because I ’m a mature , self - aware woman who has learned from her mistakes , I ’m being one hundred percent careful this time not to get sucked into the fantasy . Yes , we ’re married . But it ’s just a piece of paper for us . Yes , the sex is great . But it ’s just sex . Yes , Enzo is hot and funny and maybe slightly less irksome these days . But I ’m on a mission , and I know what it is — and what it ’s not . ”
66754	66764	66765	66765	Cheyenne	1472	“ We ca n’t have nice things , Chey . ”
66770	66778	66765	66765	Cheyenne	1472	“ Nope , we sure ca n’t . ”
66779	66785	66786	66786	I	1723	“ You guys are ridiculous , ”
66797	66821	66786	66786	I	1723	“ And I ’m leaving before you get any more carried away . Enzo and I are not a love story . Period . ”
67088	67092	67084	67084	they	877	“ Jesus Christ . ”
67126	67131	67132	67132	he	876	“ Am I dead ? ”
67139	67161	67132	67132	he	876	“ Is this heaven ? Because this is exactly what I imagine it looks like and sounds like and smells like . ”
67167	67172	67162	67162	I	1723	“ You ’re late . ”
67173	67213	67214	67214	He	876	“ I ’m sorry . We ’re behind on this project , and I had to make sure the tile guys did n’t fuck off and leave before the job was done . Then I stopped at the florist . ”
67240	67249	67233	67233	he	876	“ You chose the tile guys over me ? ”
67250	67261	67262	67262	He	876	“ No one would choose the tile guys over you . ”
67283	67299	67300	67300	He	876	“ You said you ’d be home at six o’clock . It ’s six twenty . ”
67304	67313	67300	67300	He	876	“ I ’ll make it up to you . ”
67314	67325	67326	67326	I	1723	“ I do n’t know if I ’m interested anymore . ”
67340	67343	67344	67344	He	876	“ No ? ”
67365	67370	67371	67371	My	1723	“ How about now ? ”
67388	67391	67385	67385	I	1723	“ Meh . ”
67392	67395	67396	67396	His	876	“ Meh ? ”
67409	67430	67400	67400	he	876	“ Last night you said my body looked like it was sculpted by Michelangelo . But tonight it ’s meh ? ”
67445	67457	67400	67400	he	876	“ Last night you were n’t late for our anniversary dinner . ”
67458	67476	67400	67400	he	876	“ I said I was sorry . I brought you roses . Ca n’t you forgive me ? ”
67477	67508	67509	67509	He	876	“ No . Because then you ’ll think it ’s okay to be late all the time . In order to teach you a lesson , I think I should — ”
67550	67554	67555	67555	I	1723	“ No fair , ”
67562	67578	67555	67555	I	1723	“ I ’m in heels . You ’re in boots , you can run faster . ”
67579	67589	67590	67590	he	876	“ What are you gon na do about it ? ”
67600	67605	67593	67593	his	876	“ Hide somewhere else . ”
67674	67679	67680	67680	he	876	“ Tell you what , ”
67687	67730	67680	67680	he	876	“ Since I ’m a nice guy , I ’m going to give you a head start . I ’ll let you get to the top of the stairs before I come after you . That ’s fair , is n’t it ? ”
67731	67734	67735	67735	I	1723	“ No , ”
67747	67757	67735	67735	I	1723	“ On your mark , get set , go . ”
67815	67819	67804	67804	his	876	“ You cheated ! ”
67839	67853	67820	67820	I	1723	“ You said you ’d give me until the top of the stairs ! ”
67888	67902	67906	67906	I	1723	“ I did n’t cheat . I lied . There ’s a difference . ”
67920	67929	67906	67906	I	1723	“ You once told me you never lied . ”
67930	67947	67948	67948	He	876	“ That was before you put on the apron . Before you ran away from me . ”
67965	67991	67961	67961	his	876	“ Do you think that was nice to do to your husband ? Torture him ? Make him mad ? Turn him into a monster ? ”
68007	68017	67961	67961	his	876	“ What are you going to do to me ? ”
68018	68026	68027	68027	My	1723	“ I ’m going to punish you . ”
68032	68035	68027	68027	My	1723	“ How ? ”
68110	68119	68090	68090	he	876	“ Come on , Lucy . Fight me . ”
68167	68172	68173	68173	he	876	“ Do you surrender ? ”
68210	68213	68214	68214	I	1723	“ Never , ”
68217	68227	68228	68228	He	876	“ Then I guess you leave me no choice . ”
68242	68247	68228	68228	He	876	“ What about now ? ”
68263	68278	68260	68260	I	1723	“ No ! Is it too late to change my mind about marrying you ? ”
68279	68288	68289	68289	He	876	“ On our anniversary ? You heartless wench . ”
68309	68319	68260	68260	I	1723	“ I did n’t sign up for this abuse ! ”
68320	68328	68329	68329	He	876	“ This is n’t abuse , babe . ”
68339	68344	68329	68329	He	876	“ This is revenge . ”
68345	68349	68350	68350	I	1723	“ For what ? ”
68373	68382	68385	68385	his	876	“ For making me want you this way . ”
68399	68408	68409	68409	My	1723	“ For teasing me . For tempting me . ”
68423	68428	68409	68409	My	1723	“ You deserved it . ”
68429	68434	68435	68435	He	876	“ Maybe I did . ”
68457	68467	68435	68435	He	876	“ But you ’re still a wicked little girl . ”
68468	68473	68474	68474	I	1723	“ You like it , ”
68646	68649	68638	68638	He	876	“ Enzo , ”
68656	68659	68638	68638	He	876	“ Please . ”
68660	68664	68638	68638	He	876	“ Please what ? ”
68665	68670	68638	68638	He	876	“ Let me come . ”
68671	68677	68678	68678	I	1723	“ Say you ’re sorry . ”
68684	68692	68693	68693	He	876	“ I ’m sorry . I surrender . ”
68696	68701	68703	68703	he	876	“ So fucking easy . ”
68817	68820	68804	68804	his	876	“ Yes , ”
68830	68836	68837	68837	he	876	“ Have I told you , ”
68844	68860	68837	68837	he	876	“ how much I fucking love this outfit ? You should wear it every day . ”
68871	68879	68861	68861	I	1723	“ Would we ever leave the house ? ”
68880	68883	68884	68884	he	876	“ No , ”
68896	68903	68884	68884	he	876	“ You ’d lose your company . ”
68904	68909	68910	68910	He	876	“ Fuck my company . ”
68933	68947	68948	68948	He	876	“ All I want is you . All I fucking want is you . ”
69189	69192	69193	69193	he	876	“ Fuck , ”
69202	69206	69193	69193	he	876	“ You okay ? ”
69207	69212	69213	69213	I	1723	“ I ’m fine , ”
69241	69265	69227	69227	He	876	“ Can I put in a request for more nights where I come home to meatball subs and you wearing only an apron ? ”
69266	69275	69276	69276	I	1723	“ Are you going to be on time ? ”
69279	69320	69276	69276	I	1723	“ Never . Because I fucking love it when you ’re mad at me . I ’m beginning to understand why my parents fought all the time . I think it was foreplay . No wonder they had six kids . ”
69328	69348	69323	69323	I	1723	“ I ’d settle for one . Can I get up now ? I think my arms are dead . ”
69349	69388	69389	69389	He	876	“ Yes , but before we move , I would just like to say , I really think I did it this time . Because I was like next level deep . Intergalactic deep . Deep Space Nine . ”
69407	69419	69421	69421	myself	1723	“ Wow . Your ass has two giant handprints on it . ”
69435	69440	69421	69421	myself	1723	“ Does it really ? ”
69441	69455	69458	69458	he	876	“ Yes . It looks like a kindergarten art project I did once . ”
69467	69476	69477	69477	I	1723	“ But this was a lot more fun . ”
69483	69509	69477	69477	I	1723	“ Next time , I get to be rough with you . I ’m going to etch my name on your back with my fingernails . ”
69510	69520	69521	69521	He	876	“ Stop it , you ’re turning me on . ”
69528	69533	69534	69534	I	1723	“ No , wait , ”
69542	69556	69557	69557	He	876	“ Let me just rest here a minute . Maybe it will help . ”
69574	69587	69557	69557	He	876	“ There . Want me to tip you upside down or something ? ”
69588	69615	69557	69557	He	876	“ No . But I just realized the oven is on . There ’s nothing in there yet , but maybe we should turn it off ? ”
69616	69640	69557	69557	He	876	“ Fuck no , I ’m starving . I ’ll go down and get the sandwiches together . What else can I do ? ”
69641	69654	69557	69557	He	876	“ Nothing . I ’ll be down in a minute or two . ”
69655	69668	69669	69669	he	876	“ You ’re not going to put clothes on , are you ? ”
69673	69684	69685	69685	I	1723	“ I ’ll get mad at you all over again . ”
69688	69701	69685	69685	I	1723	“ Maybe just some pants . You can take them off later . ”
69702	69711	69685	69685	I	1723	“ I suppose that will have to do . ”
69712	69715	69716	69716	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
69726	69739	69740	69740	He	876	“ Was this a better ending than waking up from your dream ? ”
69752	69755	69756	69756	he	876	“ Babe , ”
69763	69770	69756	69756	he	876	“ It ’s not even close . ”
69788	69795	69781	69781	I	1723	“ Not . Even . Close . ”
69873	69876	69877	69877	I	1723	“ Cute , ”
69895	69911	69912	69912	He	876	“ Thank you . My sister Cat got it for me for Christmas last year . ”
69917	69927	69912	69912	He	876	“ You sit down . I ’ve got this . ”
69928	69935	69877	69877	I	1723	“ I was just going to — ”
69936	69954	69912	69912	He	876	“ You ’re just going to sit down and relax . I poured you some more wine , and”—he
69959	69966	69877	69877	I	1723	second—“wait , can you have wine ? ”
69967	69974	69975	69975	I	1723	“ A few sips are okay , ”
69978	70000	69975	69975	I	1723	“ Good . Then you sit down right there while I get dinner on the table . You ’ve done enough . ”
70001	70013	70021	70021	he	876	“ At least let me put the roses in a vase . ”
70014	70020	70021	70021	he	876	“ I will permit that , ”
70054	70057	70045	70045	he	876	“ Witchcraft , ”
70093	70108	70109	70109	he	876	“ There ’s a house for sale I ’m thinking of buying to flip , ”
70117	70128	70109	70109	he	876	“ The agent called me today . Huge price reduction . ”
70129	70133	70109	70109	he	876	“ Oh yeah ? ”
70134	70147	70109	70109	he	876	“ Yeah . It ’s in the Historic District . Center Avenue . ”
70148	70154	70109	70109	he	876	“ I love Center Avenue ! ”
70155	70203	70204	70204	He	876	“ Want to go look at it tomorrow ? It would be a pretty big project . It ’s old as fuck , has some water damage , and has n’t been redecorated since Star Wars was in theaters , but it would be a cool project . ”
70207	70213	70109	70109	he	876	“ If you were interested . ”
70214	70225	70109	70109	he	876	“ Like . . . we ’d do it together ? ”
70226	70273	70109	70109	he	876	“ That ’s what I was thinking . I ’ve got some extra cash right now — my dad gave me a wife bonus , so thanks — and you ’re really good at what you do . I think we ’d make a good team . ”
70274	70280	70281	70281	I	1723	“ I think so too . ”
70295	70305	70281	70281	I	1723	“ Sure . Let ’s go look at it . ”
70636	70649	70652	70652	him	906	“ Hey , you know what this kind of reminds me of ? ”
70664	70688	70652	70652	him	906	“ The night you first came to dinner at my place . When we sat at my island and drew up the contract . ”
70689	70700	70701	70701	He	906	“ Oh yeah . You ’re right , it does . ”
70706	70712	70701	70701	He	906	“ I like this better . ”
70713	70716	70717	70717	I	1723	“ Same , ”
70747	70758	70739	70739	I	1723	“ So , this is a pretty big restoration job . ”
70759	70771	70739	70739	I	1723	“ Biggest I ’ve ever tackled , that ’s for sure . ”
70772	70793	70739	70739	I	1723	“ It ’s going to take a while , do n’t you think ? Like maybe four to six months ? ”
70794	70799	70800	70800	I	1723	“ Sounds about right . ”
70805	70824	70825	70825	He	906	“ That ’s . . . that ’s potentially longer than phase two , depending on our luck . ”
70830	70839	70825	70825	He	906	“ You have no faith in my skills . ”
70840	70848	70739	70739	I	1723	“ Enzo , I ’m being serious . ”
70849	70899	70825	70825	He	906	“ So am I. Look , I happen to have a good feeling about phase two , but even if I ’m wrong and your sorry pessimistic ass is right , I do n’t see a reason why we should n’t be able to work together on the house . ”
70900	70908	70825	70825	He	906	“ People might think it ’s weird . ”
70909	70921	70922	70922	He	906	“ Fuck people . I do n’t care what they think . ”
70932	70943	70922	70922	He	906	“ I want to do this together . Do you ? ”
70944	70947	70948	70948	I	1723	“ Yes , ”
70954	71005	70948	70948	I	1723	“ The house has tons of potential , it will be an excellent investment for you , and it will be a fantastic marketing tool for me . I ’d love to document the entire renovation on social media and then hold a big open house once it ’s complete . ”
71006	71015	71016	71016	I	1723	“ Okay . Then let ’s do it . ”
71023	71029	71016	71016	I	1723	“ Let ’s do it . ”
71110	71117	71118	71118	he	906	“ She ’s so fucking talented , ”
71121	71129	71118	71118	he	906	“ This could be huge for her . ”
71225	71234	71210	71210	I	1723	“ Hey , say something to bug me , ”
71246	71292	71293	71293	He	906	“ We ’ve been getting along so well all day , I feel like I ’m losing my grip on reality . Or like maybe you ’ve been kidnapped by aliens and I ’m going to give birth to something that looks like Baby Yoda . ”
71296	71309	71293	71293	He	906	“ Do n’t say that . What if he can hear you ? ”
71310	71316	71293	71293	He	906	“ Who ? Baby Yoda ? ”
71317	71323	71293	71293	He	906	“ No , our baby . ”
71324	71332	71293	71293	He	906	“ We do n’t have a baby . ”
71333	71340	71346	71346	he	906	“ You do n’t know that . ”
71352	71384	71385	71385	He	906	“ He could be in there right now , listening to us . Or what if it ’s a girl ? You ’re giving her a complex about her looks already . ”
71390	71403	71385	71385	He	906	“ Do n’t listen to her , sweetheart . You ’re beautiful . ”
71412	71443	71404	71404	I	1723	“ Even if she was in there , she does n’t have ears yet . Now stop jinxing us . All I wanted was for you to say something annoying . ”
71444	71447	71448	71448	He	906	“ Okay . ”
71460	71500	71448	71448	He	906	“ I think it ’s weird that you cut your pizza with a knife and eat it with a fork . As if you ’re too fancy to pick it up like a normal person . How ’s that ? ”
71501	71506	71404	71404	I	1723	“ That ’s good . ”
71507	71533	71534	71534	I	1723	“ And why do you have so much shit in your car ? And in your purse ? What are you , a homeless person ? ”
71537	71542	71534	71534	I	1723	“ That ’ll do . ”
71543	71552	71448	71448	He	906	“ You sure ? I ’ve got more . ”
71553	71563	71564	71564	He	906	“ I ’m sure . Turn off the light . ”
71575	71580	71564	71564	He	906	“ Night , Lucy . ”
71581	71586	71448	71448	He	906	“ Night , Ricky . ”
71792	71795	71796	71796	he	906	“ What ? ”
71804	71810	71811	71811	I	1723	“ It did n’t work , ”
71818	71824	71811	71811	I	1723	“ I ’m not pregnant . ”
71838	71847	71826	71826	he	906	“ I ’m sorry . Are you okay ? ”
71848	71853	71854	71854	His	906	“ I ’m okay . ”
71863	71872	71854	71854	His	906	“ This month was a long shot anyway . ”
71873	71888	71889	71889	I	1723	“ I ’m going to refrain from making jokes about my awesome long shot . ”
71900	71912	71889	71889	I	1723	“ So what ’s next ? When can we try again ? ”
71913	71938	71854	71854	His	906	“ Well , I ’m going to start Clomid on Monday . Then I think we can try again about ten days after that . ”
71939	71969	71970	71970	I	1723	“ Okay . In the meantime , let ’s focus on getting that house , okay ? How about we put in a lowball offer and see what happens ? ”
71973	71976	71978	71978	me	1723	“ Hey . ”
71995	72021	71980	71980	he	906	“ In ten days , we can try again . And by this time next month , we ’ll be celebrating . I know it . ”
72022	72029	71980	71980	he	906	“ I hope you ’re right . ”
72030	72038	72039	72039	I	1723	“ I ’m always right . Remember ? ”
72045	72051	72039	72039	I	1723	“ How could I forget ? ”
72052	72068	72075	72075	he	906	“ I do n’t know . You ’re not too bright sometimes . Come here . ”
72093	72111	72075	72075	he	906	“ Let ’s go out for dinner tonight . I ’ll even let you choose the place . ”
72112	72115	72075	72075	he	906	“ Okay . ”
72302	72310	72291	72291	she	1472	“ Want to watch TV or anything ? ”
72315	72322	72323	72323	she	1472	“ Nah . I ’m tired , ”
72326	72337	72323	72323	she	1472	“ I think I ’ll just head up to bed . ”
72338	72347	72348	72348	I	1723	“ Okay . I ’ll go up too . ”
72374	72382	72367	72367	I	1723	“ Whoa . You lost or what ? ”
72396	72404	72383	72383	I	1723	“ It ’s this way , Columbus . ”
72405	72417	72383	72383	I	1723	“ Well , I was n’t sure where I should sleep . ”
72418	72423	72424	72424	I	1723	“ What ? Why ? ”
72439	72492	72435	72435	She	1472	“ Well , because we can’t — we do n’t need to — there wo n’t be sex for a while . So I thought maybe I should sleep in the other room , the one I was supposed to use . Most of my clothes are still in there and everything . ”
72504	72515	72516	72516	She	1472	“ Do you want to sleep in the other room ? ”
72547	72556	72532	72532	I	1723	“ It ’s an easy question , Bianca . ”
72557	72564	72565	72565	she	1472	“ No , it is n’t , ”
72574	72598	72599	72599	She	1472	“ What ’s so difficult about it ? Do you want to sleep in here with me or alone in the other room ? ”
72609	72627	72628	72628	I	1723	“ It ’s not really fair of you to ask me that question when you ’re shirtless . ”
72631	72634	72628	72628	I	1723	“ No ? ”
72635	72643	72628	72628	I	1723	“ No . It clouds my judgement . ”
72644	72652	72653	72653	I	1723	“ What about when I do this ? ”
72668	72672	72673	72673	I	1723	“ Or this ? ”
72691	72697	72702	72702	she	1472	“ Can you think now ? ”
72707	72712	72702	72702	she	1472	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
72713	72724	72725	72725	Her	1472	“ I know . But you ca n’t resist me . ”
72730	72743	72744	72744	She	1472	“ Oh , I think I can . In fact , goodnight . ”
72774	72782	72783	72783	I	1723	“ You ’re the one being ridiculous . ”
72789	72795	72783	72783	I	1723	“ Just stay in here . ”
72796	72806	72807	72807	she	1472	“ Do you want me to stay in here ? ”
72811	72829	72830	72830	She	1472	“ I do n’t know . Maybe you should take off your shirt and ask me again . ”
72833	72863	72830	72830	She	1472	“ Listen , I ’m just trying to stick as close to the original arrangement as possible . I feel like we ’ve mucked things up so much already . ”
72966	72977	72978	72978	I	1723	“ I still think you should just stay in here , ”
72982	73002	72978	72978	I	1723	“ It seems stupid for you to go back and forth . Plus I like sleeping next to you . ”
73003	73007	73008	73008	She	1472	“ You do ? ”
73012	73045	73008	73008	She	1472	“ Yes . Sleeping Bianca is my favorite . She smells just as good as Awake Bianca , but she never rolls her eyes and she does n’t give me any lip . ”
73046	73078	73079	73079	I	1723	“ Sleeping Enzo is nice too . All of the muscles , none of the attitude . Although , he does snore , so it ’s a bit of a tradeoff . ”
73085	73091	73092	73092	She	1472	“ So will you stay ? ”
73111	73118	73108	73108	she	1472	“ Yes . I ’ll stay . ”
73119	73122	73123	73123	I	1723	“ Good . ”
73145	73148	73134	73134	I	1723	“ Enzo . ”
73185	73189	73190	73190	she	1472	“ Thank you , ”
73296	73299	73300	73300	she	1463	“ No , ”
73333	73340	73329	73329	I	1723	“ It ’s only been five . ”
73341	73347	73307	73307	She	1463	“ But it ’s Friday . ”
73348	73351	73329	73329	I	1723	“ So ? ”
73352	73363	73329	73329	I	1723	“ So usually we do fun things on Friday nights . ”
73364	73377	73329	73329	I	1723	“ We did do a fun thing . We made homemade ravioli . ”
73378	73411	73412	73412	She	1463	“ Yes , and while that was more fun than I thought it would be , it still does not compare to the kind of fun I am thinking of right now . ”
73455	73467	73446	73446	I	1723	“ How about now ? Has it been ten days yet ? ”
73468	73477	73478	73478	I	1723	“ Nope . It ’s only been seven . ”
73505	73526	73492	73492	She	1463	“ Are you sure ? Because I really think it ’s been at least ten days . Maybe even twenty . ”
73527	73534	73535	73535	She	1463	“ Yes , I ’m sure . ”
73543	73564	73565	73565	I	1723	“ But I ’m glad you ’re so eager to get back on the job . Your dedication is inspiring . ”
73574	73598	73599	73599	She	1463	“ Frankly , these workplace conditions are appalling . I ’m suffering from some kind of work - related mental and emotional stress . ”
73618	73626	73627	73627	I	1723	“ How about some workman ’s compensation ? ”
73633	73641	73642	73642	Her	1463	“ What did you have in mind ? ”
73659	73669	73642	73642	Her	1463	“ I ’m sure we can work something out . ”
73670	73675	73680	73680	she	1463	“ Are you serious ? ”
73698	73704	73680	73680	she	1463	“ Do I look serious ? ”
73705	73711	73712	73712	I	1723	“ You look fucking hot , ”
73723	73731	73732	73732	She	1463	“ And this feels like Christmas morning . ”
73999	74004	74005	74005	I	1723	“ Oh my God , ”
74015	74024	74025	74025	She	1463	“ That was fucking incredible . Marry me . ”
74028	74034	74025	74025	She	1463	“ We ’re already married . ”
74035	74039	74040	74040	I	1723	“ Oh yeah . ”
74184	74200	74170	74170	She	1463	“ So how was that ? Good enough to tide you over until Wednesday night ? ”
74317	74327	74328	74328	I	1723	“ Tell me what I can do for you , ”
74363	74366	74357	74357	She	1463	“ Nothing . ”
74367	74372	74373	74373	I	1723	“ Are you sure ? ”
74378	74386	74373	74373	I	1723	“ I ’m really good with my — ”
74387	74392	74393	74393	she	1463	“ I ’m sure , ”
74408	74433	74398	74398	she	1463	“ I know you ’re really good with your everything , but I can wait . Technically , we just broke the rules anyway . ”
74434	74450	74451	74451	I	1723	“ What do you mean ? We got rid of the no - sex rule , ”
74463	74475	74476	74476	she	1463	“ We got rid of it for the purpose of conception , ”
74479	74497	74476	74476	she	1463	“ What we just did was fun , but it ’s not going to get me pregnant . ”
74498	74501	74502	74502	I	1723	“ True . ”
74513	74524	74525	74525	She	1463	“ So you ’re saying that was fun for you ? ”
74528	74568	74525	74525	She	1463	“ Yes , that was fun for me . But do n’t let it go to your head . I mostly did it so that you ’d stop bothering me — until Wednesday anyway . Now go to sleep . ”
74667	74670	74654	74654	he	936	“ Sure , ”
74681	74699	74671	74671	I	1723	“ Let me just text Bianca and let her know I ’ll be a little bit late . ”
74756	74766	74767	74767	Cole	81	“ So how ’s everything going with you guys ? ”
74779	74782	74767	74767	Cole	81	“ Good . ”
74850	74892	74838	74838	she	1463	“ She did n’t get pregnant last month , so she was upset about that , but other than that , it ’s been good . We ’re actually getting along pretty well . Much better than I thought we would . ”
74893	74898	74899	74899	he	940	“ That ’s cool , ”
74902	74909	74899	74899	he	940	“ Sorry about the other thing . ”
74910	74915	74916	74916	I	1723	“ It ’s okay . ”
74919	74957	74916	74916	I	1723	“ She knew it probably would n’t happen that fast . I do n’t know shit about that stuff — apparently you have to time it exactly right , and even then the chances are n’t great . ”
74958	74968	74969	74969	Cole	81	“ I do n’t know much about it either , ”
74972	74980	74969	74969	Cole	81	“ Trisha got pregnant almost right away . ”
74981	74992	74916	74916	I	1723	“ Yeah , I guess some people just get lucky . ”
75005	75013	74998	74998	Bianca	1463	“ Unless I ’m doing it wrong . ”
75021	75043	75014	75014	Cole	81	“ It ’s not that . I remember it took my brother ’s wife a while too . Almost a year . ”
75044	75050	75051	75051	I	1723	“ A year ? Shit . ”
75056	75071	75051	75051	I	1723	“ She only gave me three months , and I ’m down one already . ”
75072	75081	75082	75082	I	1723	“ Ca n’t you give yourselves more time ? ”
75093	75103	75082	75082	I	1723	“ I do n’t think that ’s an option . ”
75104	75108	75051	75051	I	1723	“ Why not ? ”
75109	75130	75082	75082	I	1723	“ We agreed from the start that this was temporary . We said three months , unless she got pregnant . ”
75131	75141	75142	75142	Cole	81	“ You also said you would n’t have sex , ”
75146	75161	75142	75142	Cole	81	“ If that part of your plan can change , why not the timeline ? ”
75162	75168	75169	75169	I	1723	“ I do n’t know , ”
75172	75183	75169	75169	I	1723	“ I just feel like that ’s a bad idea . ”
75184	75187	75082	75082	I	1723	“ Why ? ”
75188	75291	75292	75292	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . Like what if it still wo n’t work , and month after month , we ’re just stuck with each other , no end in sight , and she starts to hate me for letting her down and I start to regret putting myself in this position , where I ’m failing a wife I did n’t even want in the first place , and all we do is fight and get on each other ’s nerves , and then she leaves , because we ruined everything , and we hate each other forever . . . ”
75305	75316	75292	75292	I	1723	“ Fuck . Just . . . fuck . No . ”
75317	75325	75326	75326	Cole	81	“ When you put it that way , ”
75329	75338	75339	75339	He	943	“ it ’s tough to argue with you . ”
75342	75352	75339	75339	He	943	“ But what if it went the other way ? ”
75353	75363	75292	75292	I	1723	“ You mean , what if she gets pregnant ? ”
75364	75380	75339	75339	He	943	“ Sure , let ’s say she does . You ’d still let her leave ? ”
75389	75426	75339	75339	He	943	“ I ’d have to , if she wanted to go . It ’s what I agreed to . And why would I want to be with someone who did n’t want to be with me ? ”
75427	75432	75439	75439	I	1723	“ But what if — ”
75433	75438	75439	75439	I	1723	“ Okay , stop . ”
75455	75528	75439	75439	I	1723	“ You ’re making this complicated when it is n’t . There ’s no sense in asking what if questions . If she does n’t get pregnant , we shake hands and get a divorce in two months . If she does , we shake hands and get a divorce in a year . That was the deal . It ’s the only way we do n’t end up hating each other . ”
75553	75558	75542	75542	Cheyenne	1472	“ Hi , Daddy , ”
75575	75586	75587	75587	Cole	81	“ Guess what ? We ’re making pancakes for dinner ! ”
75594	75598	75587	75587	Cole	81	“ My favorite . ”
75599	75605	75606	75606	Mariah	86	“ Hi , Uncle Enzo . ”
75611	75616	75617	75617	I	1723	“ Hey , squirt . ”
75646	75666	75667	75667	She	86	“ You ’re getting so tall . Pretty soon I wo n’t even be able to call you squirt . ”
75672	75675	75667	75667	She	86	“ Good ! ”
75676	75681	75682	75682	Cheyenne	1472	“ Hey , Enzo , ”
75699	75708	75667	75667	She	86	“ Would you like to stay for dinner ? ”
75709	75732	75667	75667	She	86	“ Much as I love pancakes , I ca n’t , but thanks for asking . I ’m bringing home dinner tonight . ”
75733	75739	75740	75740	she	86	“ Such a good husband , ”
75747	75753	75754	75754	I	1723	“ Who ’d have guessed ? ”
75760	75780	75754	75754	I	1723	“ Alright , I ’m out of here , before the abuse gets any worse . Bye , guys . ”
76027	76041	76012	76012	I	1723	“ Come on , it ’s so close . Ca n’t we try ? ”
76042	76045	76046	76046	she	1472	“ No , ”
76049	76059	76012	76012	I	1723	“ It ’s not time . One more night . ”
76060	76065	76066	76066	I	1723	“ Is it me , ”
76070	76087	76066	76066	I	1723	“ or are these last couple days somehow way longer than twenty - four hours apiece ? ”
76088	76093	76012	76012	I	1723	“ They ’re not . ”
76094	76103	76104	76104	I	1723	“ Maybe we should at least rehearse tonight . ”
76115	76128	76129	76129	She	1472	“ You know , make sure we remember how to do it . ”
76134	76166	76129	76129	She	1472	“ Nope . We have to time this perfectly . According to my predictor kit and the doctor ’s instructions , tomorrow is best , so we ’re waiting until tomorrow . ”
76167	76176	76177	76177	I	1723	“ But we can do it tomorrow too . ”
76186	76190	76191	76191	She	1472	“ No way . ”
76196	76218	76219	76219	I	1723	“ We can only do it every other day . Too much sex can decrease the number of gold medal swimmers . ”
76240	76243	76244	76244	I	1723	“ Fine , ”
76247	76252	76244	76244	I	1723	“ I ’ll wait . ”
76253	76257	76227	76227	she	1472	“ Thank you . ”
76258	76284	76287	76287	her	1472	“ But it wo n’t be easy . You ’ve got this very angry librarian thing happening right now . It ’s turning me on . ”
76302	76305	76290	76290	She	1472	“ Good . ”
76363	76370	76371	76371	she	1472	“ I ’ll be right there , ”
76374	76382	76383	76383	I	1723	“ You do n’t have to come , ”
76387	76428	76383	76383	I	1723	“ They said he only lost consciousness briefly and just needs an X - ray . I ’m sure he ’s fine , and it ’s in the middle of your workday . Do n’t you have meetings this afternoon ? ”
76429	76434	76435	76435	she	1472	“ I ’m canceling , ”
76438	76449	76450	76450	She	1472	“ I ’ll be there as soon as I can . ”
76535	76595	76529	76529	Bianca	1472	“ Because , Ma , they already told us , they ’re short a radiologist today and it ’s taking longer to get results . They said it would be a few hours , and they ’re sorry for the delay . Those people brought in someone having an asthma attack who did n’t need an X - ray . ”
76608	76611	76612	76612	she	256	“ Hey , ”
76619	76623	76612	76612	she	256	“ Any news ? ”
76653	76657	76658	76658	She	256	“ Not yet . ”
76664	76669	76658	76658	She	256	“ How are you ? ”
76670	76675	76676	76677	my mother	256	“ I ’m angry , ”
76681	76686	76676	76677	my mother	256	“ At the doctors ? ”
76687	76707	76708	76708	She	256	“ Yes , and at Carlo ! He had no business being up on a ladder at his age ! ”
76719	76730	76708	76708	She	256	“ Why do n’t I get us all some coffee ? ”
76731	76767	76708	76708	She	256	“ Thank you , dear . That sounds perfect . We have n’t wanted to leave in case one of these doctors decides we ’re worth his time and comes out to talk to us . ”
76768	76774	76775	76775	She	256	“ I ’ll get it . ”
76780	76787	76775	76775	She	256	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
76788	76791	76792	76792	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
76809	76819	76820	76821	my mother	256	“ She ’s a gem , is n’t she ? ”
76824	76828	76829	76829	I	1723	“ She is , ”
76907	76922	76923	76923	she	256	“ He ’s trying to kill me , that ’s what he ’s doing , ”
76926	76932	76933	76933	I	1723	“ By climbing a ladder ? ”
76950	76997	76998	76998	She	256	“ By doing something I ’ve told him a million times he should n’t do ! He knows damn well he does n’t have the balance anymore , and that he ’ll fall and cause me to have a heart attack when I hear the news ! ”
77003	77030	76998	76998	She	256	“ Do n’t laugh at me . You know it ’s the truth . He does things like this on purpose just to make me mad ! ”
77038	77043	77031	77031	I	1723	“ This is why . ”
77059	77064	77050	77050	she	256	“ I get it . ”
77244	77271	77228	77228	I	1723	“ Hey . Thank you for being there today , it meant a lot to me . I ’m sorry it was such a long day . ”
77272	77283	77284	77284	She	1472	“ Do n’t apologize . I wanted to be there . ”
77298	77315	77284	77284	She	1472	“ And if — if you do n’t feel like trying tonight , I would understand . ”
77316	77319	77320	77320	I	1723	“ Hush . ”
77325	77348	77320	77320	I	1723	“ You go upstairs and relax . Take a bubble bath or something . I ’ll be up in a little bit . ”
77349	77352	77353	77353	she	1472	“ Okay , ”
77356	77365	77353	77353	she	1472	“ But I mean it . No pressure . ”
77366	77371	77372	77372	I	1723	“ I heard you . ”
77377	77387	77372	77372	I	1723	“ Now go do what I said , woman . ”
78323	78326	78316	78316	I	1723	“ Enzo ? ”
78339	78342	78343	78343	I	1723	“ Enzo ? ”
78386	78392	78393	78393	he	63	“ Enzo is not here , ”
78422	78427	78417	78417	I	1723	“ And you are ? ”
78428	78437	78438	78438	He	63	“ I am Edward Mullins , of course . ”
78446	78452	78438	78438	He	63	“ You mean Edward Cullen ? ”
78453	78487	78417	78417	I	1723	“ Yes , sorry . I have been in a deep slumber for so long , I forgot my last name . But when I smelled your blood , I grew very thirsty . ”
78488	78497	78438	78438	He	63	“ You can smell my blood , huh ? ”
78498	78503	78438	78438	He	63	“ But of course . ”
78504	78520	78417	78417	I	1723	“ That’s — that ’s quite an outfit you ’ve got on there , Edward . ”
78521	78527	78528	78528	He	63	“ Do you like it ? ”
78543	78555	78528	78528	He	63	“ I was n’t sure if capes were still in fashion . ”
78565	78572	78557	78557	he	63	“ Or do you mean this ? ”
78583	78589	78573	78573	I	1723	“ I like it all . ”
78590	78593	78594	78594	He	63	“ Good . ”
78610	78627	78607	78607	he	63	“ I have not seen such beauty in centuries . I must have you or die . ”
78652	78663	78607	78607	he	63	“ Ow ! Can you take those things out please ? ”
78664	78669	78670	78670	He	63	“ If you insist . ”
78684	78692	78670	78670	He	63	“ Ah , yes . Much better . ”
78703	78714	78695	78695	I	1723	“ Do you want to take your cape off too ? ”
78715	78719	78720	78720	His	63	“ That depends . ”
78747	78761	78762	78762	I	1723	“ Will you still want me when I look like a mere mortal ? ”
78779	78791	78762	78762	I	1723	“ Enzo , you have never looked like a mere mortal . ”
78792	78797	78798	78798	He	63	“ In that case . ”
78822	78837	78815	78815	his	63	“ Yes , this is much better . God , I ’ve missed you . ”
79012	79015	79016	79016	I	1723	“ Enzo , ”
79024	79029	79019	79019	he	63	“ Say something real . ”
79030	79033	79034	79034	He	63	“ What ? ”
79043	79048	79049	79049	I	1723	“ Say something real , ”
79075	79083	79084	79084	he	63	“ I never stop thinking about you , ”
79093	79097	79098	79098	I	1723	“ Keep going , ”
79110	79130	79098	79098	I	1723	“ No one has ever made me feel the way you do . Sometimes I ca n’t even breathe . ”
79131	79134	79135	79135	I	1723	“ Yes , ”
79153	79160	79146	79146	I	1723	“ Yes , yes , yes . ”
79161	79169	79170	79170	He	63	“ I want to give you everything . ”
79184	79187	79188	79188	He	63	“ Everything . ”
79636	79641	79616	79616	Enzo	63	“ Morning , Lucy . ”
79642	79645	79646	79646	I	1723	“ Morning . ”
79673	79679	79616	79616	Enzo	63	“ How was your workout ? ”
79680	79709	79616	79616	Enzo	63	“ Great . I stopped for coffee on the way home . Got you some tea , and do n’t worry — it ’s herbal . No caffeine . ”
79710	79715	79716	79716	I	1723	“ Does n’t matter , ”
79723	79726	79716	79716	I	1723	“ Huh ? ”
79727	79732	79733	79733	I	1723	“ Does n’t matter , ”
79750	79753	79754	79754	He	63	“ Hey . ”
79779	79785	79786	79786	I	1723	“ What ’s going on ? ”
79845	79848	79849	79849	he	63	“ Shh , ”
79856	79861	79849	79849	he	63	“ It ’s okay . ”
79862	79867	79868	79868	I	1723	“ It ’s not , ”
79881	79893	79868	79868	I	1723	“ I failed . Even on the drug , I failed . ”
79894	79905	79849	79849	he	63	“ That ’s ridiculous . If anything , I failed . ”
79906	79928	79868	79868	I	1723	“ It ’s me , Enzo . You had the test , and you were fine . I ’m the problem . ”
79929	79932	79933	79933	He	63	“ Hey . ”
79952	79969	79970	79970	I	1723	“ This was one missed chance , that ’s all . We get more , right ? ”
79981	79985	79970	79970	I	1723	“ One more . ”
79986	80007	80008	80008	His	63	“ Okay , so do n’t give up . You know what they say , third time ’s the charm . ”
80016	80019	80020	80020	I	1723	“ Right ? ”
80078	80081	80082	80082	he	63	“ Right ? ”
80086	80089	80082	80082	he	63	“ Right . ”
80161	80183	80156	80156	He	63	“ I forgot to tell you , my nephew James ’s fourth birthday party is tomorrow afternoon at Pietro ’s house . ”
80184	80189	80190	80190	I	1723	“ Sounds like fun , ”
80325	80337	80316	80316	Enzo	63	“ We can pick something up for James in town today , ”
80345	80385	80338	80338	I	1723	“ Good idea . I was thinking of getting him a baseball glove and maybe a batting tee . He starts tee ball next month , and Pietro sucks at baseball , so I figure I better teach him . ”
80391	80395	80338	80338	I	1723	“ Of course . ”
80396	80403	80404	80404	He	63	“ You gon na be okay ? ”
80415	80418	80419	80419	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
80425	80436	80419	80419	I	1723	“ Sorry . I made a mess of your shirt . ”
80437	80463	80419	80419	I	1723	“ Fuck my shirt . I ’m a mess anyway . How about I shower up really quick and we hit the diner for breakfast ? ”
80464	80470	80471	80471	I	1723	“ Or maybe the bakery , ”
80487	80492	80419	80419	I	1723	“ You got it . ”
80532	80537	80538	80538	she	1723	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
80545	80559	80538	80538	she	1723	“ And do n’t say nothing because I can tell there ’s something . ”
80560	80567	80568	80568	I	1723	“ I got my period today , ”
80578	80581	80568	80568	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
80586	80591	80582	80582	She	1723	“ I ’m sorry . ”
80592	80597	80598	80598	I	1723	“ It ’s okay . ”
80603	80620	80598	80598	I	1723	“ We can try again next month . I ’ll start another round of Clomid Monday . ”
80621	80642	80582	80582	She	1723	“ Let me know if you need anything . An ear to rant into , a shoulder to cry on . ”
80643	80646	80647	80647	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
80667	80676	80661	80661	He	63	“ I cried all over Enzo this morning . ”
80677	80680	80681	80681	She	1723	“ Yeah ? ”
80689	80697	80681	80681	She	1723	“ How are things with you guys ? ”
80698	80705	80706	80706	I	1723	“ Good . They ’re good . ”
80717	80730	80731	80731	Her	1723	“ We ’re picking up the keys to the new house today . ”
80736	80747	80731	80731	Her	1723	“ That ’s exciting ! When will the renovation begin ? ”
80748	80755	80756	80756	I	1723	“ Right away , I hope . ”
80770	80783	80756	80756	I	1723	“ I could use the distraction . I think we both could . ”
80784	80793	80731	80731	Her	1723	“ Was Enzo sad about the . . . ”
80794	80797	80798	80798	I	1723	“ Yes , ”
80801	80809	80798	80798	I	1723	“ But he ’s been really sweet . ”
80810	80837	80756	80756	I	1723	“ Of course he has . He ’s not an asshole . And he genuinely cares about you , Bianca . No matter what you think . ”
80846	80860	80756	80756	I	1723	“ We ’re actually getting along much better than I thought we would . ”
80861	80864	80756	80756	I	1723	“ Really ? ”
80865	80873	80874	80874	I	1723	“ Yes . In fact . . . ”
80886	80895	80874	80874	I	1723	“ I ’m kind of worried about it . ”
80896	80899	80756	80756	I	1723	“ Why ? ”
80900	80941	80756	80756	I	1723	“ Well , because the longer we live together , the better I get to know him , the more sex we have — the closer I feel to him . He ’s not the guy I thought he was . ”
80942	80945	80946	80946	I	1723	“ No ? ”
80951	81008	81009	81009	Her	1723	“ No . In fact , he ’s shown himself to be incredibly kind and understanding through all this fertility stuff . I mean , do n’t get me wrong , he can still be a cocky bastard , and he loves to get under my skin , but he ’s actually a really good husband . ”
81014	81023	81009	81009	Her	1723	“ Any chance you guys might stay together ? ”
81024	81027	81028	81028	I	1723	“ No , ”
81032	81041	81028	81028	I	1723	“ There ’s been no talk about that . ”
81042	81076	81009	81009	Her	1723	“ Well , maybe you should talk about it . After all , things have changed since you guys drew up that ridiculous contract . Maybe you can give yourselves some more time . ”
81077	81086	81087	81087	I	1723	“ More time would just make it worse , ”
81091	81107	81087	81087	I	1723	“ If it does n’t work this next month , I have to walk away . ”
81108	81117	81118	81118	She	1723	“ Without even telling him how you feel ? ”
81123	81126	81118	81118	She	1723	“ Why ? ”
81127	81170	81171	81171	My	1723	“ Because the last time I opened myself up to someone like that , it ended with my heart shattered into a million pieces . This arrangement with Enzo was supposed to guard against that . He was supposed to be safe . ”
81176	81204	81205	81205	Her	1723	“ But how do you know he is n’t ? I think you should be honest with him . Men are n’t mind readers , you know . ”
81472	81479	81480	81480	Pietro	1062	“ So how ’s newlywed life ? ”
81523	81528	81529	81529	I	1723	“ Good . Great . ”
81545	81567	81529	81529	I	1723	“ Your wedding dress was so cute . Of course , everything is cute on you . You ’re so petite . ”
81578	81584	81568	81568	She	91	“ I ’m a whale . ”
81585	81600	81623	81623	she	91	“ Not at all . You look fantastic . When are you due again ? ”
81601	81621	81623	81623	she	91	“ May twenty - fourth . So I still have four weeks left , if you can believe it . ”
81626	81633	81623	81623	she	91	“ But I should n’t complain . ”
81649	81654	81645	81645	I	1723	“ It ’s okay . ”
81655	81663	81664	81664	she	91	“ Actually , I love being pregnant , ”
81668	81689	81664	81664	she	91	“ I ’m not one of those women so concerned about her figure that they worry pregnancy will ruin it . ”
81724	81746	81747	81747	She	91	“ I just think it ’s the greatest gift , you know ? Such a miracle . Good job , honey ! ”
81799	81810	81811	81811	she	91	“ Enzo has always been so sweet to the kids , ”
81815	81823	81811	81811	she	91	“ He ’d make a great dad . ”
81824	81830	81831	81831	I	1723	“ Yes , he would . ”
81930	81936	81920	81920	he	109	“ See what I mean ? ”
81948	81956	81937	81937	Lynne	87	“ You guys should totally have kids . ”
81957	81963	81964	81964	I	1723	“ So we ’ve heard , ”
81974	82008	82009	82009	She	83	“ Let me guess — Mama Moretti is already on you about it . I was n’t married to Pietro for ten minutes before she asked me when I planned on getting pregnant . ”
82016	82037	82009	82009	She	83	“ Luckily , it happened on my wedding night , can you believe it ? We were n’t even trying ! ”
82038	82051	81937	81937	Lynne	87	“ Wow . That is lucky . You have a beautiful family . ”
82052	82120	82121	82121	She	83	“ Thank you . You will too someday . But do n’t wait too long . My sister ’s best friend Anna — she ’s an E.R. doctor — was always too busy to date and found herself still single at almost forty . She tried to get pregnant with a sperm donor , but it was too late . Her eggs were bad quality by then . ”
82127	82147	82121	82121	She	83	“ They never tell you that , do they ? That your eggs have a sell - by date . ”
82157	82171	82148	82148	I	1723	“ I need to use the bathroom real quick . Be right back . ”
82182	82187	82123	82123	her	83	“ Hey , you . ”
82201	82207	82196	82196	Enzo	63	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
82208	82213	82214	82214	I	1723	“ I ’m fine , ”
82217	82283	82284	82284	I	1723	“ Except that I know you , and you ’re not fine . You ’re wearing your Very Serious Face , the one you make when the sauce is n’t quite right and you ca n’t figure out what you need more of , and you ’re hoping you do n’t need less of something , because there ’s nothing to be done about that . ”
82289	82292	82284	82284	I	1723	“ Ha . ”
82293	82301	82302	82302	He	63	“ Come on . Talk to me . ”
82307	82324	82302	82302	He	63	“ You signed a contract saying you would n’t make me read your mind , remember ? ”
82325	82331	82284	82284	I	1723	“ I remember the contract . ”
82351	82360	82344	82344	I	1723	“ Are you still upset about this morning ? ”
82361	82364	82302	82302	He	63	“ Yes . ”
82512	82522	82523	82523	I	1723	“ Lynne said something that made me feel bad , ”
82526	82532	82523	82523	I	1723	“ What did she say ? ”
82533	82590	82523	82523	I	1723	“ Nothing awful . It was just the wrong day to tell me how much she loves being pregnant , what a miracle it is , what a great dad you ’ll make , how her sister ’s friend waited too long to try to have a baby and never could because her eggs got old . ”
82591	82601	82602	82602	He	63	“ Why is she saying that shit to you ? ”
82606	82624	82625	82625	I	1723	“ It ’s just how women talk . She did n’t mean to make me feel bad , ”
82646	82687	82630	82630	his	63	“ Half the women in your family — and mine too — love to ask me when we ’re going to have kids . Sometimes it ’s a struggle to keep the smile on my face and evade the question . ”
82688	82698	82700	82700	Enzo	63	“ They should all fucking mind their own business , ”
82702	82717	82718	82718	I	1723	“ And I ’m going to tell them so next time I see them . ”
82724	82734	82718	82718	I	1723	“ No , do n’t . It ’s okay . ”
82735	82749	82718	82718	I	1723	“ It is n’t . Anyone who messes with you messes with me . ”
82954	83003	82949	82949	I	1723	“ Special rule for Bianca : No falling in love with Enzo Moretti , and if you forget for one moment what a cocky , arrogant , egotistical , presumptuous , swaggering ass he is , just come back and look at this list ! ! ! ! ! ”
83144	83151	83137	83137	Enzo	256	“ Bianca ? Are you okay ? ”
83165	83170	83152	83152	I	1723	“ I ’m fine , ”
83182	83189	83171	83171	I	1723	“ Be out in a minute . ”
83638	83643	83644	83644	I	1723	“ Are you sure ? ”
83647	83671	83644	83644	I	1723	“ Yes . I ’m really tired , so I ’m just going to heat up some leftovers and go to bed early . ”
83672	83692	83694	83694	she	1472	“ Okay . Let me know if you change your mind and want company . I could make dinner . ”
83804	83809	83793	83793	I	1723	“ Sorry , what ? ”
83810	83817	83818	83818	Griffin	225	“ What ’s with you tonight ? ”
83821	83829	83818	83818	Griffin	225	“ You seem kinda out of it . ”
83830	83847	83848	83848	I	1723	“ Just — just thinking about all the shit I have to get done this weekend . ”
83862	83887	83818	83818	Griffin	225	“ Anyone feels like tearing up carpet , removing wallpaper , and ripping out cabinets , come on over to the new house tomorrow . ”
83888	83893	83894	83894	Cole	81	“ I can help , ”
83897	83903	83894	83894	Cole	81	“ I ’m off tomorrow . ”
83904	83907	83909	83909	Beckett	1537	“ Same , ”
83911	83939	83909	83909	Beckett	1537	“ My sister ’s in town , so I should be able to get away for a while . She can keep an eye on my dad . ”
83940	83946	83948	83948	Griffin	225	“ I ’ll come too , ”
83950	83960	83948	83948	Griffin	225	“ Probably around one , after the garage closes . ”
83961	83966	83967	83967	Griffin	225	“ Thanks , guys . ”
83996	84009	84010	84010	I	1723	“ Blair keeps saying this week how worried she is about her . ”
84013	84029	84010	84010	I	1723	“ Yeah , she , uh , did n’t get pregnant this month . Again . ”
84030	84033	84010	84010	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
84034	84041	84010	84010	I	1723	“ She took it really hard . ”
84042	84050	84010	84010	I	1723	“ Ca n’t you just keep trying ? ”
84051	84057	84058	84058	I	1723	“ That ’s the plan . ”
84066	84114	84058	84058	I	1723	“ But I get the feeling she ’s not all that hopeful anymore . And I feel so fucking bad , you know ? I want to be able to give her what she wants . I hate when there ’s a problem I ca n’t fix . ”
84115	84136	84010	84010	I	1723	“ Same . But I do n’t think we can compare this to a blown tire or a kitchen remodel . ”
84137	84144	84145	84145	I	1723	“ No , we ca n’t , ”
84148	84192	84145	84145	I	1723	“ It just sucks to see her this way . Is it weird that I like it better when she ’s arguing with me or telling me what an egotistical dickhead I am ? She does n’t even seem like the same person . ”
84193	84206	84058	84058	I	1723	“ Maybe she just needs some time to work through the disappointment . ”
84207	84257	84058	84058	I	1723	“ We do n’t really have time . I ’m telling you , this fertility stuff is such bullshit . You have to be so precise with the timing , and even then it might not work . What if I ca n’t deliver on the promise I made ? ”
84258	84273	84274	84274	He	1074	“ Then I guess you guys get a divorce and go your separate ways . ”
84279	84286	84274	84274	He	1074	“ Was n’t that the plan ? ”
84287	84308	84145	84145	I	1723	“ It was , but — I feel like I ’m abandoning her or something . It ’s fucked up . ”
84309	84326	84327	84327	My	1723	“ Do you want to stay married even if she does n’t get pregnant this month ? ”
84332	84415	84416	84416	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . If you ’d have asked me a week ago , I might have said something different . We were having so much fun — she was happy . I was happy . There was a part of me that thought maybe we should stay together , but then this week is the total opposite . I feel angry and useless and pretty fucking miserable . Not as miserable as she is , but Christ . . . ”
84421	84481	84416	84416	I	1723	“ I ’m remembering all the reasons why I never wanted to get married in the first place . She ’s not talking to me . I have no idea if she wants me around or not . I ’m too anxious to even touch her . We ’re not fighting , but I even miss the goddamn fights . ”
84482	84506	84507	84507	Griffin	225	“ I ’m sorry , man . I wish I had some advice . Somehow I figured it out , but . . . ”
84515	84529	84507	84507	Griffin	225	“ I feel like Blair must have done a lot of the work . ”
84530	84537	84538	84538	I	1723	“ But how did you know ? ”
84541	84580	84538	84538	I	1723	“ Seriously , how did you know you could do it , the whole marriage thing , just you and her for the rest of your lives ? How did you know you would be good at it ? ”
84581	84586	84587	84587	he	225	“ I did n’t , ”
84593	84613	84614	84614	I	1723	“ But it was either try it or lose her , and I knew I could n’t lose her . ”
84624	84654	84614	84614	I	1723	“ I thought I ’d like the certainty of knowing it would end at a certain point . Now it feels like the clock is ticking faster every day . ”
84655	84660	84538	84538	I	1723	“ So what now ? ”
84661	84726	84727	84727	Griffin	225	“ I think we can try again middle of next week . She takes this pill for five days , which she ’s doing now , and then we wait for five days , then we have sex every other day for like a week . I ’m telling you , it ’s like a fucking math problem trying to get this woman pregnant . ”
84730	84735	84736	84736	I	1723	“ Sounds like it . ”
85010	85013	85014	85014	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
85044	85050	85051	85051	Her	1472	“ I brought you something . ”
85062	85067	85056	85056	she	1472	“ What ’s this ? ”
85068	85074	85075	85075	I	1723	“ It ’s a picnic , ”
85078	85098	85075	85075	I	1723	“ to celebrate our seven - week anniversary . I bet you did n’t even realize it was today . ”
85099	85104	85105	85105	she	1472	“ I did n’t , ”
85117	85153	85105	85105	she	1472	“ Well , lucky for you , I ’m a romantic . And nothing says Happy Fake Seven Week Anniversary like some delicious jampagne and chocolate that ’s probably left over from Valentine ’s Day . ”
85160	85168	85105	85105	she	1472	“ Who could say no to that ? ”
85204	85207	85197	85197	Bianca	1472	“ Impressive . ”
85208	85221	85222	85222	I	1723	“ What did I tell you about my long shot , babe ? ”
85234	85246	85247	85247	She	1472	“ I think that means our luck is about to change . ”
85274	85297	85298	85298	I	1723	“ To seven weeks of wedded bliss . May the next seven be as fruitful as a glass of sparkling strawberry jampagne . ”
85305	85308	85309	85309	she	1472	“ Cheers , ”
85345	85348	85349	85349	She	1472	“ Mmm . ”
85352	85355	85356	85356	I	1723	“ Mmm . ”
85366	85378	85356	85356	I	1723	“ Here . Because nothing goes with sugar like more sugar . ”
85379	85383	85384	85384	She	1472	“ Thank you . ”
85392	85395	85384	85384	She	1472	“ Well ? ”
85396	85399	85400	85400	I	1723	“ Delicious . ”
85403	85427	85428	85428	She	1472	“ And all this time I ’ve been spending money on the good stuff when you ’re happy with drugstore wine and candy . ”
85439	85448	85428	85428	She	1472	“ How was your night with the guys ? ”
85449	85452	85453	85453	I	1723	“ Good . ”
85466	85483	85453	85453	I	1723	“ They ’re going to come over to the house tomorrow and give us a hand . ”
85484	85489	85428	85428	She	1472	“ Oh , nice . ”
85490	85505	85506	85506	She	1472	“ I figure we can get the kitchen torn out with the extra muscle . ”
85509	85543	85506	85506	She	1472	“ Sounds good . I ’m hoping to get all that wallpaper in the front hall removed over the next few days . I ’m afraid to see how many layers there are . ”
85555	85563	85506	85506	She	1472	“ Do n’t do anything too strenuous . ”
85564	85568	85506	85506	She	1472	“ Why not ? ”
85569	85579	85506	85506	She	1472	“ Because you need to take care of yourself . ”
85580	85584	85585	85585	I	1723	“ For what ? ”
85588	85601	85602	85602	She	1472	“ What do you mean , for what ? For the baby . ”
85612	85622	85602	85602	She	1472	“ There ’s no baby , Enzo . Remember ? ”
85623	85634	85635	85635	I	1723	“ Well , not yet . But there will be . ”
85641	85653	85654	85654	She	1472	“ What ’s the target shooting schedule like for next week ? ”
85658	85664	85654	85654	She	1472	“ I ’m not sure . ”
85665	85671	85672	85672	I	1723	“ You ’re not sure ? ”
85678	85715	85716	85716	She	1472	“ How is that possible ? Last month , you were like , ‘ We must bang on Wednesday evening at precisely ten - twenty - two p.m. Eastern Standard Time when the moon is full . ”
85721	85724	85716	85716	She	1472	“ Sorry . ”
85733	85756	85726	85726	I	1723	“ No , I ’m sorry . I should n’t make jokes . I was just wondering what day would be best . ”
85757	85770	85726	85726	I	1723	“ Wednesday , I guess . If you still want to try . ”
85771	85774	85775	85775	I	1723	“ Huh ? ”
85784	85794	85775	85775	I	1723	“ Why would n’t I still want to try ? ”
85795	85815	85726	85726	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . I ’ve just been thinking maybe you were getting tired of all this . ”
85816	85821	85775	85775	I	1723	“ All this what ? ”
85822	85830	85831	85831	She	1472	“ All this . . . me . ”
85847	85859	85836	85836	she	1472	“ I know this is n’t what you signed up for . ”
85860	85900	85901	85901	I	1723	“ What the hell are you talking about ? This is exactly what I signed up for , Bianca . You asked me for three months and I said yes , right ? Along with some really ridiculous shit ? ”
85910	85922	85901	85901	I	1723	“ Where is that contract ? Let ’s look at it . ”
85923	85926	85901	85901	I	1723	“ Why ? ”
85927	85950	85951	85951	I	1723	“ For fun . Come on , it will make you laugh . Remember how much fun we had making it up ? ”
86010	86017	86003	86003	She	1472	“ Things were different back then . ”
86018	86043	86044	86044	I	1723	“ I know , but it will still be funny . I ca n’t even remember some of the things we put on it . ”
86053	86062	86044	86044	I	1723	“ I know you still have it somewhere . ”
86063	86070	86071	86071	she	1472	“ It ’s in the bathroom , ”
86074	86089	86071	86071	she	1472	“ Top drawer on the right . The one you gave me to use . ”
86100	86117	86090	86090	I	1723	“ You keep our marriage contract in the can ? That says a lot right there . ”
86385	86390	86378	86378	I	1723	“ What ’s this ? ”
86399	86407	86391	86391	I	1723	“ You have n’t been taking them ? ”
86420	86440	86414	86414	She	1472	“ Be honest with me , Bianca . Did you not take the pills because you changed your mind ? ”
86454	86459	86461	86461	she	1472	“ I . . . ”
86467	86475	86461	86461	she	1472	“ Yes . I changed my mind . ”
86480	86483	86461	86461	she	1472	“ Why ? ”
86484	86505	86461	86461	she	1472	“ Because it was n’t going to work anyway , and I figure we might as well just stop pretending . ”
86506	86520	86521	86521	My	1723	“ And you did n’t think to say anything to me about it ? ”
86538	86553	86529	86529	She	1472	“ I was going to . I just needed some time to process everything . ”
86554	86562	86563	86563	I	1723	“ Bianca , this is . . . ”
86666	86679	86680	86680	She	1472	“ Please do n’t be mad at me , Enzo . Please . ”
86685	86723	86680	86680	She	1472	“ I tried so hard to talk myself into it , but I just could n’t . I do n’t want the disappointment again . I do n’t want to feel like I ’m letting you down . ”
86724	86729	86680	86680	She	1472	“ You ’re not . ”
86730	86736	86737	86737	she	1472	“ Yes , I am , ”
86745	86765	86680	86680	She	1472	“ I know you want kids , and you can still have them . You do n’t need me . ”
86766	86769	86680	86680	She	1472	“ But — ”
86770	86777	86778	86778	She	1472	“ Listen to me , Enzo . ”
86791	86830	86778	86778	She	1472	“ You tried , and I appreciate that . I could n’t have asked for anything more . And if you need me to stay longer to make sure Moretti & Sons goes to you , I will . ”
86831	86836	86837	86837	I	1723	“ Otherwise , what ? ”
86870	86886	86778	86778	She	1472	“ Otherwise , I think it ’s best if I go back to my condo . ”
86887	86892	86778	86778	She	1472	“ For how long ? ”
86893	86899	86900	86900	Her	1472	“ For good , Enzo . ”
86923	86935	86905	86905	she	1472	“ It ’s better this way , ca n’t you see ? ”
86936	86939	86778	86778	She	1472	“ How ? ”
86940	86971	86972	86972	I	1723	“ Because we can stay friends . I can still help you with the house . We can still talk . We just wo n’t be . . . together . ”
87146	87155	87156	87156	she	1472	“ I ’ll call you tomorrow , okay ? ”
87168	87171	87159	87159	she	1472	“ Okay . ”
87197	87202	87181	87181	She	1472	“ Bianca , wait . ”
87216	87219	87220	87220	she	1472	“ What ? ”
87223	87230	87231	87231	I	1723	“ This is what you want ? ”
87234	87239	87231	87231	I	1723	“ You ’re sure ? ”
87240	87245	87246	87246	Her	1472	“ I ’m sure . ”
87268	87282	87257	87257	I	1723	“ Can you — can you let me know when you get there ? ”
87283	87286	87231	87231	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
87293	87312	87314	87314	she	1472	“ I ’m really sorry , Enzo . But it ’s for the best . Please trust me . ”
88648	88655	88645	88645	JJ	1463	“ Bianca , what the hell ? ”
88656	88665	88666	88666	I	1723	“ You got chips all over the floor , ”
88672	88690	88666	88666	I	1723	“ So you have to clean it up now ? It ’s the middle of the night . ”
88691	88701	88702	88702	I	1723	“ It is not . It ’s after seven . ”
88708	88717	88702	88702	I	1723	“ And why are you sleeping out here ? ”
88718	88736	88737	88737	He	1463	“ I do n’t know . I came home and got hungry . I wanted a snack . ”
88761	88768	88769	88769	I	1723	“ I must have fallen asleep . ”
88800	88814	88794	88794	JJ	1463	“ What are you doing here anyway ? I thought you got married . ”
88815	88828	88829	88829	I	1723	“ I did . We ’re . . . having some issues . ”
88852	88856	88794	88794	JJ	1463	“ What issues ? ”
88857	88863	88794	88794	JJ	1463	“ None of your business . ”
88864	88881	88794	88794	JJ	1463	“ Is he annoying or something ? The girl I ’m dating is so fucking annoying . ”
88882	88890	88794	88794	JJ	1463	“ No , he ’s not annoying . ”
88891	88902	88903	88903	He	1463	“ You ’re not moving back in , are you ? ”
88907	88916	88903	88903	He	1463	“ I do n’t have anywhere to go . ”
88917	88926	88927	88927	He	1463	“ Relax . You can stay for now . ”
88931	88934	88935	88935	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
88939	88952	88935	88935	I	1723	“ It actually looks like you ’ve kept the place pretty neat . ”
88953	88957	88958	88958	he	1463	“ Oh that , ”
88963	88975	88976	88976	My	1723	“ Yeah , Mom comes over once a week and cleans . ”
88980	88987	88976	88976	My	1723	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? ”
88988	88999	89000	89000	I	1723	“ No . She does laundry and grocery shops too . ”
89005	89018	89000	89000	I	1723	“ That is ridiculous . You are a grown man , JJ . ”
89019	89055	88976	88976	My	1723	“ I did n’t ask her to , Bianca . She insists . I think she ’s afraid you ’ll kick me out and I ’ll have to move back in with her and Dad . ”
89056	89068	89069	89069	I	1723	“ Well , you need to start looking for a place , ”
89073	89091	89069	89069	I	1723	“ It ’s time for you to stop acting like a kid and get your shit together . ”
89092	89097	89098	89098	he	1122	“ Okay , okay , ”
89104	89117	89098	89098	he	1122	“ Jeez . It ’s too early for this kind of abuse . ”
89118	89124	89131	89131	He	1122	“ Then go to bed . ”
89125	89130	89131	89131	He	1122	“ I ’m going . ”
89141	89151	89131	89131	He	1122	“ I liked you better when you were married . ”
89445	89458	89433	89434	My brother	1448	“ Hey . Want to order a pizza for dinner or something ? ”
89459	89468	89433	89434	My brother	1448	“ Sure . You ’re not going out ? ”
89469	89476	89477	89477	He	1448	“ I might go out later . ”
89492	89499	89433	89434	My brother	1448	“ What ’s wrong with you ? ”
89500	89504	89433	89434	My brother	1448	“ Just stuff . ”
89505	89509	89433	89434	My brother	1448	“ Like what ? ”
89510	89520	89433	89434	My brother	1448	“ I do n’t want to talk about it . ”
89521	89524	89525	89525	He	1448	“ Okay . ”
89575	89580	89556	89556	I	1723	“ Want a glass ? ”
89581	89584	89585	89585	He	1448	“ Nah . ”
89598	89607	89608	89608	I	1723	“ So tell me about your new girlfriend , ”
89622	89628	89608	89608	I	1723	“ Do I know her ? ”
89629	89646	89556	89556	I	1723	“ She ’s not my girlfriend . We ’ve only been dating for a few weeks . ”
89647	89653	89608	89608	I	1723	“ What ’s her name ? ”
89654	89657	89658	89658	I	1723	“ Reina . ”
89666	89669	89658	89658	I	1723	“ Reina ? ”
89670	89673	89674	89674	He	1448	“ Yeah . ”
89686	89695	89674	89674	He	1448	“ What do you want on your pizza ? ”
89696	89701	89702	89702	I	1723	“ Anything is fine . ”
89710	89718	89702	89702	I	1723	“ Is Reina super young and hot ? ”
89719	89733	89734	89734	I	1723	“ Yeah , but she ’s really into herself . It bugs me . ”
89741	89770	89771	89771	He	1448	“ Well , give her a chance . Maybe she ’s insecure . Some people come off the wrong way at first because they ’re shy or nervous . ”
89778	89788	89771	89771	He	1448	“ I do n’t think that ’s her problem . ”
89859	89874	89875	89876	my brother	1448	“ So are you going to tell me what happened with Enzo or not ? ”
89916	89924	89875	89876	my brother	1448	“ Did you guys have a fight ? ”
89925	89929	89875	89876	my brother	1448	“ Not really . ”
89930	89937	89875	89876	my brother	1448	“ So why are you here ? ”
89938	89955	89956	89956	I	1723	“ I ’m here because Enzo and I realized that we might have rushed into marriage , ”
89964	89972	89960	89960	JJ	1463	“ I could have told you that . ”
89973	89990	89875	89876	my brother	1448	“ We ’re taking some time and space to figure out the best way to proceed . ”
89991	89999	90000	90000	I	1723	“ Are you going to get divorced ? ”
90004	90010	90000	90000	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . ”
90011	90017	89960	89960	JJ	1463	“ Do you love him ? ”
90056	90063	90052	90052	my	1723	“ That ’s a complicated question . ”
90064	90068	90000	90000	I	1723	“ It is ? ”
90069	90072	90073	90073	I	1723	“ Yes , ”
90089	90116	90073	90073	I	1723	“ And even if I said yes , I do love him , it does n’t mean we should stay married . There are other factors . ”
90117	90121	90052	90052	my	1723	“ Like what ? ”
90139	90149	90124	90124	I	1723	“ Like whether or not he feels the same . ”
90150	90159	90073	90073	I	1723	“ You think he does n’t love you ? ”
90160	90169	90170	90170	I	1723	“ I know he does n’t love me . ”
90188	90196	90124	90124	I	1723	“ Then why ’d he marry you ? ”
90197	90209	90210	90210	I	1723	“ Look , this is why I said it was complicated . ”
90228	90263	90124	90124	I	1723	“ I ca n’t explain why we ca n’t be married anymore , but I just know that we ca n’t . We tried , we failed . That ’s it , the end . ”
90264	90274	90275	90275	I	1723	“ Does n’t seem like you tried very hard . ”
90294	90302	90124	90124	I	1723	“ Hey , where are you going ? ”
90303	90308	90124	90124	I	1723	“ To my office ! ”
90309	90316	90124	90124	I	1723	“ Why ? We ’re talking . ”
90317	90323	90324	90324	I	1723	“ I ’m done talking ! ”
90384	90387	90388	90388	she	1472	“ Hey , ”
90397	90401	90388	90388	she	1472	“ Hold on . ”
90417	90422	90423	90423	she	1472	“ Where are you ? ”
90429	90435	90436	90436	I	1723	“ I ’m at home , ”
90439	90451	90436	90436	I	1723	“ As in my old condo . Why are you whispering ? ”
90452	90469	90436	90436	I	1723	“ Because Griffin and Enzo are here and I do n’t want them to hear me . ”
90482	90491	90492	90492	she	1472	“ Why are you at your old condo ? ”
90495	90525	90492	90492	she	1472	“ Because Enzo and I are moving ahead with the plan at an accelerated pace . Phase two failed . We ’re now in phase three — the breakup . ”
90526	90532	90436	90436	I	1723	“ You ’re breaking up ? ”
90533	90542	90492	90492	she	1472	“ Actually , we were never really together . ”
90543	90569	90492	90492	she	1472	“ You know what I mean . You ’re moving out ? You ’re getting divorced ? You ’re not trying for a baby anymore ? ”
90570	90576	90577	90577	I	1723	“ All of the above , ”
90587	90644	90577	90577	I	1723	“ I figured something had happened . I went by the Center Avenue house this afternoon with sandwiches and offered to stay and help out . Enzo was acting so weird , and you were nowhere to be found , and he kept saying he was n’t sure where you were or if you were coming . ”
90645	90654	90655	90655	I	1723	“ What do you mean , acting weird ? ”
90658	90693	90694	90694	I	1723	“ He was just not himself at all . Silent and broody . Big scowl on his face . Barking directions at everyone and snapping if anyone asked a question — especially about you . ”
90707	90714	90694	90694	I	1723	“ So you ’re really leaving ? ”
90715	90722	90694	90694	I	1723	“ I have to , Blair . ”
90723	90731	90732	90732	she	1139	“ Because of what you told me ? ”
90736	90739	90740	90740	I	1723	“ Yes , ”
90750	90805	90740	90740	I	1723	“ I could n’t stay another month . I could n’t keep sleeping with him . I could n’t bear another heartbreaking disappointment . I could n’t risk falling deeper in love with him . All of it was too much — I felt like I was under water . I could n’t breathe . ”
90806	90822	90823	90823	I	1723	“ I ’m sorry , Bianca . I wish there was something I could do . ”
90834	90862	90823	90823	I	1723	“ I ’ll be okay . I ’m just going to stay away from him for a little while . Try to let my feelings cool off . ”
90863	90873	90740	90740	I	1723	“ What about all your stuff at the house ? ”
90874	90883	90884	90884	I	1723	“ I ’ll have to get it eventually . ”
90891	90900	90884	90884	I	1723	“ What ’s he doing at your place ? ”
90901	90917	90823	90823	I	1723	“ Griffin invited him over for dinner . He said he felt sorry for him . ”
90918	90926	90823	90823	I	1723	“ How long will he be there ? ”
90927	90947	90884	90884	I	1723	“ I do n’t know . We just ordered takeout . Why , do you want to come over ? ”
90948	90974	90823	90823	I	1723	“ No ! I ’m wondering if I have time to go get some more stuff from the house . All my clothes are there . ”
90975	90991	90823	90823	I	1723	“ Do you have to sneak around ? Ca n’t you just talk to him ? ”
90992	91004	91005	91005	I	1723	“ I do n’t know if I can handle it yet , ”
91013	91044	91005	91005	I	1723	“ Last night was so hard . I barely held it together . I do n’t want him to know how I feel — that will only make it worse . ”
91045	91048	90823	90823	I	1723	“ Why ? ”
91049	91077	91005	91005	I	1723	“ He ’ll just pity me . He ’ll look at me like he did after I got my period . Like he feels sorry for me . ”
91078	91088	91005	91005	I	1723	“ Well , he does . I do too . ”
91089	91103	91104	91104	I	1723	“ It ’s not how I want him to see me , okay ? ”
91134	91184	91123	91123	I	1723	“ I want my pride back . I want my strength back . I want him to look at me and see the girl he thought I was . The one with courage and determination , who can handle anything life throws at her . The one with moxie . ”
91185	91188	91207	91207	She	1141	“ Moxie ? ”
91189	91206	91207	91207	She	1141	“ Yes . He once said he liked that about me — that I had moxie . ”
91210	91227	91207	91207	She	1141	“ He likes a lot of things about you . He ’s just being an idiot . ”
91228	91243	91244	91244	I	1723	“ No , he is n’t . He ’s being exactly who he is . ”
91252	91276	91244	91244	I	1723	“ Exactly who I knew he was . And it ’s on me for falling for him when he told me not to . ”
91277	91282	91283	91283	Blair	1472	“ I hate this , ”
91286	91295	91283	91283	Blair	1472	“ Tell me what to do to help . ”
91296	91310	91244	91244	I	1723	“ Can you figure out how long he ’ll be at your place ? ”
91311	91325	91283	91283	Blair	1472	“ Am I supposed to do it without mentioning why I ’m asking ? ”
91326	91331	91332	91332	I	1723	“ If you can . ”
91343	91354	91332	91332	I	1723	“ I ’ll try . And I ’ll text you . ”
91355	91358	91361	91361	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
91447	91453	91454	91454	Griffin	225	“ What ’s going on ? ”
91465	91471	91472	91472	she	1472	“ Nothing ’s going on , ”
91481	91495	91472	91472	she	1472	“ I know that face . Something is going on . Who called ? ”
91496	91501	91502	91502	she	1472	“ Called ? When ? ”
91540	91544	91545	91545	he	225	“ Just now , ”
91548	91557	91545	91545	he	225	“ Oh . Uh , that was Cheyenne . ”
91558	91570	91571	91571	Griffin	225	“ Cheyenne and Cole are at the movies with Mariah tonight , ”
91575	91587	91571	91571	Griffin	225	“ Oh , right . Ummm , it was your mom . ”
91588	91596	91545	91545	he	225	“ My mom is out of town . ”
91597	91600	91601	91601	Blair	1472	“ Oh . ”
91605	91612	91601	91601	Blair	1472	“ It was a wrong number ? ”
91613	91618	91619	91619	Griffin	225	“ A wrong number ? ”
91624	91642	91619	91619	Griffin	225	“ And you took your phone into the bedroom and talked to this stranger for five minutes ? ”
91643	91646	91647	91647	I	1723	“ Blair , ”
91650	91655	91656	91656	She	1472	“ Was it Bianca ? ”
91662	91674	91656	91656	She	1472	“ Yes , but you ’re not supposed to know that . ”
91675	91678	91679	91679	Griffin	225	“ Why ? ”
91692	91723	91724	91724	She	1472	“ Well , she wanted me to find out how long he ’d be here , because she wants to grab some clothes from the house without running into him . ”
91729	91736	91724	91724	She	1472	“ I ’m sorry , Enzo . ”
91737	91746	91747	91747	Griffin	225	“ Wait a minute . Bianca moved out ? ”
91752	91755	91756	91756	I	1723	“ Yeah . ”
91764	91771	91772	91772	Blair	1472	“ You guys got any whiskey ? ”
91793	91798	91799	91799	she	1472	“ You want ice ? ”
91810	91813	91802	91802	she	1472	“ Nah . ”
91814	91824	91825	91825	Blair	1472	“ I told Bianca I ’d let her know , ”
91833	91841	91825	91825	Blair	1472	“ You think maybe a couple hours ? ”
91864	91873	91825	91825	Blair	1472	“ Why ca n’t she call me herself ? ”
91874	91880	91825	91825	Blair	1472	“ I do n’t know . ”
91881	91887	91888	91888	She	1472	“ What did she say ? ”
91899	91907	91888	91888	She	1472	“ I ca n’t betray her confidence . ”
91933	91955	91923	91923	I	1723	“ I do n’t understand her . Last night when she left , she said she wanted us to be friends . ”
91956	91964	91965	91965	Blair	1472	“ I think she does want that . ”
91971	91993	91965	91965	Blair	1472	“ She just needs a little time to get there . She ’s . . . she ’s sad , Enzo . ”
91994	91998	91999	91999	Blair	1472	“ About what ? ”
92002	92005	91999	91999	Blair	1472	“ Everything . ”
92006	92021	92022	92022	I	1723	“ The whole thing was her idea , did she ever tell you that ? ”
92026	92029	92030	92030	Griffin	225	“ Yes . ”
92062	92066	92051	92051	he	225	“ What happened ? ”
92067	92073	92074	92074	I	1723	“ Fuck if I know . ”
92078	92093	92074	92074	I	1723	“ One minute things were fine , the next she was packing a bag . ”
92094	92109	92111	92111	Blair	1472	“ I ’m sure it was a really hard decision for her to make , ”
92116	92126	92127	92127	Griffin	225	“ Did you guys have a fight or something ? ”
92142	92153	92130	92130	I	1723	“ No . We have n’t fought in a while . ”
92154	92164	92165	92165	Blair	1472	“ Trying to get pregnant can be really stressful , ”
92168	92173	92174	92174	I	1723	“ I know that , ”
92183	92206	92178	92178	I	1723	“ Sorry . I ’m just — in a bad mood . And tired . I did n’t sleep much last night . ”
92207	92211	92212	92212	Blair	1472	“ I understand , ”
92226	92231	92232	92232	he	225	“ Want a glass ? ”
92236	92243	92232	92232	he	225	“ Yes . Thanks , honey . ”
92373	92376	92363	92363	she	1472	“ Enzo ? ”
92389	92392	92382	92382	they	1149	“ What ? ”
92393	92408	92409	92409	I	1723	“ Would it be okay to tell her she can go to the house ? ”
92412	92417	92409	92409	I	1723	“ It ’s fine . ”
92418	92424	92382	92382	they	1149	“ Two hours is safe ? ”
92689	92692	92683	92683	I	1723	“ Morning . ”
92756	92759	92760	92760	I	1723	“ Morning , ”
92772	92778	92763	92763	She	1472	“ That ’s for you . ”
92779	92782	92783	92783	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
92791	92796	92783	92783	I	1723	“ I need it . ”
92797	92814	92815	92815	I	1723	“ Griffin ran to the bakery for donuts . I have a rare Sunday morning off . ”
92824	92827	92828	92828	she	1472	“ Easy , ”
92831	92836	92828	92828	she	1472	“ It ’s hot . ”
92856	92863	92864	92864	She	1472	“ I think someone poisoned me . ”
92867	92874	92864	92864	She	1472	“ His name is Jack Daniels . ”
92875	92878	92864	92864	She	1472	“ Bastard . ”
92879	92884	92864	92864	She	1472	“ You ’ll live . ”
92928	92935	92936	92936	Blair	1472	“ Did you go help her ? ”
92939	92960	92936	92936	Blair	1472	“ Her brother was there too . We got everything out . She left the key on the kitchen counter . ”
92961	92964	92965	92965	I	1723	“ Good , ”
92987	92993	92980	92980	She	1472	“ How do you feel ? ”
92994	92997	92980	92980	She	1472	“ Hungover . ”
92998	93005	93006	93006	I	1723	“ I meant about Bianca leaving . ”
93017	93020	93006	93006	I	1723	“ Fine . ”
93021	93024	92980	92980	She	1472	“ Really ? ”
93025	93028	93029	93029	I	1723	“ Yeah . ”
93041	93057	93029	93029	I	1723	“ I feel fine about it . It was always the plan , after all . ”
93058	93076	93006	93006	I	1723	“ I know , but . . . I do n’t think she ’s fine about it . ”
93077	93090	93006	93006	I	1723	“ What do you mean ? She ’s the one who left . ”
93091	93101	93102	93102	I	1723	“ That does n’t mean she really wanted to . ”
93113	93181	93102	93102	I	1723	“ I ’m worn out , Blair . I ca n’t do this . I ca n’t read her mind . Unless she tells me what she ’s thinking or feeling , all I have to go on is what she says to me and what she does . And what she said Friday night was that she wanted to go . What she did was leave . ”
93192	93202	93182	93182	Blair	1472	“ She told me you found the Clomid box . ”
93203	93206	93207	93207	I	1723	“ Yes . ”
93215	93265	93207	93207	I	1723	“ That ’s a perfect example . She decided on her own not to take them , decided we were n’t going to try a third time , knew she was going to leave early , and she said nothing to me about it . I was fucking blindsided . ”
93266	93273	93182	93182	Blair	1472	“ She feels bad about that . ”
93274	93298	93207	93207	I	1723	“ But she still left , Blair . What was I supposed to do , beg her to stay ? For what reason ? ”
93299	93305	93306	93306	she	1472	“ I do n’t know , ”
93316	93327	93306	93306	she	1472	“ Maybe because you guys have feelings for each other ? ”
93328	93338	93339	93339	I	1723	“ We do n’t have feelings for each other , ”
93342	93380	93339	93339	I	1723	“ We had a contract . We had rules . We had a start date and an end date . It was all fake . What do I care if she wants out sooner rather than later ? ”
93381	93390	93391	93391	she	1472	“ It was all fake at the beginning , ”
93395	93402	93391	93391	she	1472	“ But has n’t that changed ? ”
93411	93428	93403	93403	I	1723	“ Part of me thought maybe it could change . But that was before she left . ”
93429	93449	93450	93450	Blair	1472	“ So your ego is bruised — I get it . But if there ’s anything to be salvaged , ”
93469	93480	93481	93481	Their	1156	“ do n’t you think it ’s worth a conversation ? ”
93503	93509	93499	93499	I	1723	“ I got ta go . ”
93510	93515	93516	93516	Blair	1472	“ No , stay , ”
93519	93525	93516	93516	Blair	1472	“ You should eat something . ”
93526	93532	93533	93533	I	1723	“ I ’m not hungry , ”
93543	93548	93549	93549	he	225	“ You ’re leaving ? ”
93554	93569	93549	93549	he	225	“ Yeah . I ’ll call you later . Thanks for letting me crash . ”
94409	94420	94402	94402	I	1723	“ Enzo Moretti , what is the matter with you ? ”
94456	94466	94447	94447	she	256	“ Ow , Ma ! I have a headache , ”
94475	94483	94467	94467	I	1723	“ I ’ll just bet you do . ”
94511	94519	94501	94501	her	256	“ You were n’t at church today . ”
94520	94525	94467	94467	I	1723	“ I slept in . ”
94530	94547	94467	94467	I	1723	“ Where ? Not here , because I know what was going on here last night . ”
94570	94574	94563	94563	I	1723	“ Answer me ! ”
94591	94599	94579	94579	I	1723	“ Sorry . What was the question ? ”
94600	94607	94608	94608	she	256	“ Where were you last night ? ”
94632	94639	94620	94620	I	1723	“ I was at Griffin ’s . ”
94640	94643	94646	94646	she	256	“ Really . ”
94652	94655	94646	94646	she	256	“ Really . ”
94656	94662	94663	94663	I	1723	“ Not another woman ’s ? ”
94673	94678	94663	94663	I	1723	“ What ? No ! ”
94679	94705	94646	94646	she	256	“ Because I can not imagine why your brand new wife was seen moving out of your house unless you betrayed her in some way . ”
94706	94713	94714	94714	I	1723	“ Well , I did n’t . ”
94770	94776	94762	94762	Bianca	1472	“ So where is she ? ”
94781	94787	94762	94762	Bianca	1472	“ Probably at her condo . ”
94803	94806	94807	94807	I	1723	“ Why ? ”
94810	94832	94807	94807	I	1723	“ She said she ’d made a mistake . We rushed into the marriage . She just wants to be friends . ”
94844	94847	94849	94849	she	256	“ Bullshit ! ”
94858	94867	94849	94849	she	256	“ You did something to make her mad . ”
94868	94883	94849	94849	she	256	“ No , I did n’t , Ma . You can even ask her . ”
94884	94892	94893	94893	she	256	“ Believe me , I intend to , ”
94896	94918	94893	94893	she	256	“ But in the meantime , you march right over to wherever it is she went and you apologize to her . ”
94919	94929	94849	94849	she	256	“ For what ? I did n’t do anything . ”
94930	94936	94937	94937	I	1723	“ Then apologize for that ! ”
94942	94961	94937	94937	I	1723	“ This is ridiculous . She left , Mom . Why do n’t you feel sorry for me ? ”
94962	94968	94969	94969	Her	256	“ I just do n’t ! ”
94975	94982	94969	94969	Her	256	“ I know you too well . ”
94983	94989	94893	94893	she	256	“ What ’s that mean ? ”
94990	95021	94937	94937	I	1723	“ It means , you do n’t take anything seriously . You think life is just one endless good time . A joke . Well , no one ’s laughing ! ”
95022	95031	94969	94969	Her	256	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
95038	95056	94969	94969	Her	256	“ You never took this marriage seriously . You would n’t even let the priest bless it . ”
95057	95069	95070	95070	She	256	“ Because it was just a piece of paper to us . ”
95076	95175	95070	95070	She	256	“ See what I mean ? Marriage is not just a piece of paper — it ’s a lifelong commitment . For better or worse , richer or poorer , ’ til death do you part . And with your history , Bianca probably suspected all along your heart was n’t really in it . You must have made her feel insecure . If it was n’t another woman , it had to be your job . You ’re just like your father ! You put work first ! You did n’t make her feel like a priority ! ”
95176	95187	95188	95188	I	1723	“ You have no idea what you ’re talking about , ”
95194	95220	95188	95188	I	1723	“ Then explain it to me . Why would a woman married less than two months leave the man she ’s madly in love with ? ”
95221	95232	95233	95233	I	1723	“ She ’s not in love with me , Mom ! ”
95236	95242	95243	95244	My mother	241	“ Of course she is . ”
95249	95256	95243	95244	My mother	241	“ Any idiot could see it . ”
95257	95262	95263	95263	I	1723	“ She ’s not , ”
95270	95278	95263	95263	I	1723	“ She ’s just a good actress . ”
95288	95294	95263	95263	I	1723	“ I do n’t understand . ”
95295	95319	95320	95320	Her	241	“ We were never in love . We only got married so Dad would leave Moretti & Sons to me when he retired . ”
95326	95329	95320	95320	Her	241	“ No . ”
95330	95348	95263	95263	I	1723	“ It ’s the truth . Bianca agreed to marry me because of that stupid family tradition . ”
95349	95360	95320	95320	Her	241	“ But — but — why would she do that ? ”
95361	95367	95368	95368	I	1723	“ That ’s between us , ”
95376	95395	95368	95368	I	1723	“ But she ’s blameless . This was all my doing . I ’ll come clean to Dad . ”
95396	95422	95320	95320	Her	241	“ Damn right , you will . I ’m not telling him this . It will kill him that he ’s raised a dishonest man . ”
95444	95484	95434	95434	I	1723	“ Look , I ’m not proud of myself . I ’ll tell him . Just please do n’t say anything to anyone else . It would be humiliating for Bianca and me both . This is hard enough . ”
95485	95492	95493	95494	My mother	256	“ I do n’t get it . ”
95502	95522	95493	95494	My mother	256	“ You ’re in love . I know you are . I saw it . We all saw it . ”
95523	95540	95541	95542	My mother	256	“ You all saw what you wanted to see . What we wanted you to see . ”
95548	95557	95541	95542	My mother	256	“ Then why was she crying so hard ? ”
95558	95561	95493	95494	My mother	256	“ What ? ”
95562	95579	95580	95580	I	1723	“ Last night when she was moving out , why was she crying the whole time ? ”
95592	95600	95580	95580	I	1723	“ How do you know she was ? ”
95601	95623	95624	95624	I	1723	“ Because people saw her . Edna Dodson lives right across the street and happened to be looking out her window . ”
95629	95633	95624	95624	I	1723	“ Of course . ”
95634	95646	95580	95580	I	1723	“ Then she went outside to water her flowers , and — ”
95647	95661	95624	95624	I	1723	“ At nine o’clock at night , she had to water her flowers ? ”
95662	95665	95666	95667	my mother	256	“ Yes , ”
95670	95705	95666	95667	my mother	256	“ and thank goodness she did because she called me right away , very concerned . I told her she must have been mistaken , but I can see now that I was wrong . ”
95716	95732	95733	95733	She	256	“ What do you want from me , Mom ? I told you the truth . ”
95739	95747	95748	95748	she	256	“ I want you to fix this , ”
95758	95783	95748	95748	she	256	“ I told you , I ’m going to be honest with Dad . If he wants to leave Pietro the company , fine . ”
95792	95806	95784	95784	She	256	“ I do n’t mean with your father — I mean with Bianca . ”
95807	95820	95825	95825	she	256	“ There ’s nothing to fix with Bianca . It ’s over . ”
95821	95824	95825	95825	she	256	“ Bullshit ! ”
95832	95835	95836	95836	I	1723	“ Ow , ”
95842	95856	95836	95836	I	1723	“ Jeez , I forgot how violent you are when you ’re mad . ”
95857	95903	95904	95904	I	1723	“ And I forgot how much you remind me of your father when you ’re being stubborn and ornery — you look me in the eye and tell me you do n’t love that girl , and may God strike you down if you lie ! ”
95928	95941	95942	95942	I	1723	“ Look , it does n’t matter how I feel , Mom , ”
95945	95950	95942	95942	I	1723	“ She ’s gone . ”
95951	95963	96002	96002	she	1723	“ You know what she needs to hear to come back . ”
95964	95971	95972	95972	I	1723	“ No , I do n’t ! ”
95980	95998	95972	95972	I	1723	“ Well , figure it out and say it before you lose her to someone who does ! ”
96720	96725	96726	96726	JJ	1463	“ She ’s good , ”
96729	96740	96726	96726	JJ	1463	“ Hey , can you hand me that oscillating tool ? ”
96761	96772	96752	96752	I	1723	“ Has she , uh , mentioned me at all ? ”
96773	96779	96780	96780	He	1463	“ Nope . Not really . ”
96802	96809	96794	96794	he	1463	“ What ’s she been doing ? ”
96810	96824	96752	96752	I	1723	“ She works a lot , and then she goes out at night . ”
96825	96829	96794	96794	he	1463	“ She does ? ”
96844	96872	96832	96832	I	1723	“ Huh . I did n’t think she went out much at night , especially work nights . Usually she just likes to read or watch TV . ”
96873	96885	96794	96794	he	1463	“ Yeah , she ’s been out pretty much every night . ”
96886	96890	96752	96752	I	1723	“ With who ? ”
96891	96914	96915	96915	I	1723	“ Friends , I guess . I have n’t really gotten a chance to ask her because she gets home so late . ”
96918	96922	96915	96915	I	1723	“ How late ? ”
96923	96932	96933	96933	My	1723	“ I dunno . Two or three maybe . ”
96938	96943	96933	96933	My	1723	“ In the morning ? ”
96944	96953	96915	96915	I	1723	“ Yeah . Like after the bars close . ”
97094	97098	97086	97086	Blair	1472	“ not okay . ”
97715	97721	97722	97722	Cheyenne	1472	“ So how are you ? ”
97737	97742	97743	97743	I	1723	“ I ’m okay , ”
97751	97757	97758	97758	Blair	1472	“ I ’m doing okay . ”
97762	97774	97758	97758	Blair	1472	“ Did you get your hair done ? It looks great . ”
97775	97783	97784	97784	I	1723	“ Actually , I did it myself , ”
97792	97820	97784	97784	I	1723	“ I wanted a change , and I was too impatient to wait for an opening with my stylist . I hope she does n’t kill me . ”
97821	97829	97830	97830	Cheyenne	1472	“ I ’m sure she ’ll understand , ”
97833	97840	97830	97830	Cheyenne	1472	“ We ’ve all been there . ”
97941	97950	97936	97936	Blair	1472	“ So no word from Enzo , huh ? ”
97956	97959	97951	97951	I	1723	“ Nope . ”
97960	97968	97969	97969	she	1723	“ I have n’t seen him either , ”
97972	97982	97951	97951	I	1723	“ Even Griffin said he ’s been strangely MIA . ”
97983	97986	97987	97987	Cheyenne	1472	“ Same . ”
97994	98027	98028	98028	I	1723	“ I asked Cole before I left if he ’d heard from Enzo at all this week , and he said no . Evidently , he ’s not even responding to texts . ”
98049	98086	98043	98043	I	1723	“ He could be busy at work , now that he ’s in charge , or putting in a lot of time at the Center Avenue house . But he certainly has n’t been with me . ”
98087	98094	98095	98095	Blair	1472	“ I do n’t get it ! ”
98099	98124	98095	98095	Blair	1472	“ He was so miserable the day after you left , I thought for sure he ’d beg you to come back by now . ”
98125	98139	98140	98140	I	1723	“ I think he was just mad about the way I did it , ”
98143	98159	98140	98140	I	1723	“ without consulting him first . Or that I ’d been dishonest about the Clomid . ”
98160	98169	98170	98170	Blair	1472	“ I think there was some of that , ”
98173	98209	98170	98170	Blair	1472	“ He admitted he ’d felt blindsided , and his ego definitely took a hit . But he was hurt too , Bianca . I could tell . He did n’t want you to go . ”
98210	98221	98222	98222	Cheyenne	1472	“ Then why did n’t he try to stop me ? ”
98229	98232	98233	98233	I	1723	“ What ? ”
98236	98258	98260	98260	Cheyenne	1472	“ It ’s just . . . These guys do n’t always know exactly how to express what they ’re feeling , ”
98262	98290	98260	98260	Cheyenne	1472	“ They ’re either too stubborn or they seriously just ca n’t think of the right words or they ’re plain old scared to be that vulnerable . ”
98291	98307	98308	98308	I	1723	“ The only thing Enzo is scared of is someone falling in love with him , ”
98311	98335	98308	98308	I	1723	“ but then , of course , he goes and does everything he possibly can to make you fall in love with him . ”
98336	98341	98342	98342	Cheyenne	1472	“ Not before you , ”
98350	98370	98342	98342	Cheyenne	1472	“ I ’ve known Enzo Moretti forever , and I ’ve never seen him act this way about anyone . ”
98396	98403	98404	98404	I	1723	“ But it was n’t real , ”
98411	98417	98404	98404	I	1723	“ It was n’t real . ”
98481	98486	98487	98487	he	1448	“ I ’m leaving , ”
98503	98510	98487	98487	he	1448	“ You seen my keys anywhere ? ”
98511	98517	98487	98487	he	1448	“ On the kitchen counter . ”
98518	98521	98522	98522	He	1448	“ Thanks . ”
98531	98547	98522	98522	He	1448	“ Hey , I forgot to tell you . I did you a favor today . ”
98548	98552	98487	98487	he	1448	“ What favor ? ”
98553	98563	98564	98564	I	1723	“ Enzo was asking about you , and I — ”
98568	98576	98564	98564	I	1723	“ What ? Where ? At work ? ”
98577	98617	98522	98522	He	1448	“ Yeah . He ’s paying a few guys cash under the table for side jobs at this new house he bought to flip . Anyway , he asked about you , and I said you were doing great . ”
98618	98621	98622	98622	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
98639	98654	98564	98564	I	1723	“ Then he asked if you ever mentioned him , and I said no . ”
98655	98658	98522	98522	He	1448	“ Good . ”
98659	98676	98677	98677	I	1723	“ Yeah , he looked kinda mad about that , so I kept going with it . ”
98689	98695	98677	98677	I	1723	“ What do you mean ? ”
98696	98721	98722	98722	JJ	1463	“ I mean I told him you seemed totally fine and you were going out every night until two or three in the morning . ”
98733	98736	98722	98722	JJ	1463	“ What ? ”
98737	98776	98677	98677	I	1723	“ Well , what was I supposed to tell him , that the minute you get home from work you put your pajamas on , eat ice cream for dinner , and cry the rest of the night ? ”
98777	98782	98722	98722	JJ	1463	“ No , but — ”
98783	98804	98805	98805	I	1723	“ Or that you spend so much time on the couch , the cushions are now shaped like your butt ? ”
98810	98816	98805	98805	I	1723	“ It ’s my couch ! ”
98817	98836	98677	98677	I	1723	“ Or that you told me you loved him but you left because he does n’t love you ? ”
98837	98840	98805	98805	I	1723	“ No ! ”
98841	98846	98847	98847	He	1448	“ All right then . ”
98850	98855	98856	98856	I	1723	“ You ’re welcome . ”
99011	99014	99015	99015	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
99040	99043	99044	99044	he	1463	“ Hey , ”
99047	99053	99044	99044	he	1463	“ Can I come in ? ”
99054	99058	99059	99059	I	1723	“ I guess . ”
99093	99100	99082	99082	I	1723	“ Can I get you anything ? ”
99101	99106	99107	99107	he	1463	“ No , thanks , ”
99113	99128	99129	99129	He	1463	“ I just came to bring you some things you left at the house . ”
99151	99160	99139	99139	I	1723	“ I did n’t think I left anything . ”
99161	99167	99170	99170	I	1723	“ It ’s not much . ”
99192	99198	99177	99177	I	1723	“ This is n’t mine . ”
99199	99204	99139	99139	I	1723	“ It is n’t ? ”
99205	99208	99209	99209	I	1723	“ No . ”
99214	99225	99209	99209	I	1723	“ Enzo , it ’s a men ’s extra large . ”
99226	99229	99230	99230	He	1463	“ Oh . ”
99245	99254	99230	99230	He	1463	“ I must have made a mistake then . ”
99268	99275	99230	99230	He	1463	“ These are n’t mine either . ”
99276	99293	99294	99294	he	1463	“ I know , but you really seemed to like them whenever we made homemade pasta , ”
99298	99307	99294	99294	he	1463	“ I thought you should have the set . ”
99308	99311	99312	99312	I	1723	“ Oh . ”
99352	99355	99356	99356	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
99382	99394	99395	99395	Enzo	256	“ I was n’t sure if you wanted those or not , ”
99398	99421	99395	99395	Enzo	256	“ I was just going to throw them out , but then I thought maybe you could use them in the future . ”
99431	99434	99422	99422	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
99435	99445	99446	99446	I	1723	“ There ’s only one more thing in there . ”
99487	99495	99482	99482	I	1723	“ These are n’t mine , Enzo . ”
99496	99508	99509	99509	My	1723	“ Yes , they are . I gave them to you . ”
99522	99529	99509	99509	My	1723	“ I ca n’t keep them . ”
99530	99534	99482	99482	I	1723	“ Why not ? ”
99535	99543	99544	99544	He	1448	“ Because they belong in your family . ”
99551	99560	99544	99544	He	1448	“ But I want you to have them . ”
99569	99579	99563	99563	I	1723	“ What is this ? What are you doing ? ”
99580	99590	99591	99591	I	1723	“ I’m — I’m giving back what ’s yours . ”
99605	99624	99591	99591	I	1723	“ The only thing I want back from you is something you do n’t even know you took . ”
99625	99628	99563	99563	I	1723	“ Huh ? ”
99629	99633	99591	99591	I	1723	“ Never mind . ”
99671	99681	99682	99682	He	1448	“ Here . I do n’t want this stuff . ”
99702	99710	99711	99711	I	1723	“ You ’re not going out tonight ? ”
99720	99723	99724	99724	I	1723	“ Later , ”
99727	99731	99732	99732	He	1448	“ With who ? ”
99760	99766	99751	99751	his	1448	“ No one you know . ”
99767	99770	99751	99751	his	1448	“ Where ? ”
99771	99778	99751	99751	his	1448	“ Just some places in town . ”
99779	99791	99792	99792	I	1723	“ Your brother said you ’ve been going out a lot . ”
99801	99815	99816	99816	His	1448	“ Any chance you ’d rather stay in and hang out with me ? ”
99826	99834	99816	99816	His	1448	“ I miss those Manhattans you make . ”
99835	99842	99816	99816	His	1448	“ I do n’t think so . ”
99843	99847	99848	99848	He	1448	“ Why not ? ”
99862	99868	99869	99869	He	1448	“ Because I have plans . ”
99889	99893	99869	99869	He	1448	“ Cancel them . ”
99894	99897	99898	99898	I	1723	“ No , ”
99909	99913	99914	99914	He	1448	“ Come on . ”
99932	99939	99940	99940	I	1723	“ You know you miss me . ”
99956	99961	99948	99948	he	1448	“ Seriously , Enzo ? ”
99962	99965	99966	99966	He	1448	“ What ? ”
99980	99988	99971	99971	his	1448	“ That is n’t going to work . ”
99989	99994	99948	99948	he	1448	“ What is n’t ? ”
99995	99999	99971	99971	his	1448	“ The smolder . ”
100015	100023	100024	100024	He	1448	“ Come on , it always works . ”
100041	100048	100024	100024	He	1448	“ God , you smell good . ”
100049	100052	100053	100053	I	1723	“ Enzo , ”
100096	100125	100090	100090	I	1723	“ You need to stop . You ’re only here because of what my brother told you . You do n’t like the idea of me going out . ”
100126	100131	100132	100132	he	1448	“ That ’s true , ”
100150	100155	100132	100132	he	1448	“ I do n’t . ”
100184	100193	100194	100194	he	1448	“ But I also miss you , Bianca , ”
100197	100212	100194	100194	he	1448	“ I miss your smell and your taste and your body . Come back . ”
100213	100218	100194	100194	he	1448	“ To your bed ? ”
100219	100227	100194	100194	he	1448	“ Sure , we can start there . ”
100228	100234	100194	100194	he	1448	“ And end up where ? ”
100235	100253	100194	100194	he	1448	“ The kitchen table ? The shower ? The back of my car ? You name it . ”
100268	100278	100279	100279	He	1448	“ No . That ’s not what I meant . ”
100285	100305	100279	100279	He	1448	“ So tell me what you meant , because every time I try to guess , I guess wrong . ”
100306	100315	100316	100316	I	1723	“ Just forget it . You should go . ”
100347	100355	100356	100356	Enzo	256	“ What happened to us , Bianca ? ”
100367	100377	100356	100356	Enzo	256	“ I thought we were having a good time . ”
100378	100392	100356	100356	Enzo	256	“ We were , but . . . I got confused , okay ? ”
100393	100398	100356	100356	Enzo	256	“ Confused about what ? ”
100399	100468	100356	100356	Enzo	256	“ When we first made the deal , I knew exactly what I was getting into and why . You wanted a wife , and I wanted a baby , but the two lines were n’t supposed to cross . We were each going to get what we wanted without making a mess of the other person ’s life . But it did n’t go down that way . ”
100469	100481	100356	100356	Enzo	256	“ Are you saying I made a mess of your life ? ”
100482	100489	100356	100356	Enzo	256	“ I ’m saying it happened . ”
100501	100526	100496	100496	I	1723	“ I ’ll take all the blame . It ’s my fault . But jumping back into bed tonight would only make it worse . ”
100527	100530	100531	100531	I	1723	“ How ? ”
100539	100627	100531	100531	I	1723	“ Because I ’m not like you , Enzo ! I ca n’t separate sex and feelings as easily as you can . Yes , I miss you . Yes , I lie awake at night wishing you were next to me . Yes , I am aware that I will probably never have orgasms as good as the ones I had with you . But those orgasms are not a good enough reason to toss my heart on a cutting board and hand you a knife ! ”
100628	100637	100638	100638	he	1256	“ I never asked you to do that ! ”
100642	100676	100638	100638	he	1256	“ No , of course not . In fact , you told me flat out not to fall for you . You ’re into bodies , not hearts . I have n’t forgotten . ”
100677	100683	100684	100684	he	1256	“ And this is why ! ”
100694	100708	100684	100684	he	1256	“ This is what happens when people let their feelings fuck them up ! ”
100709	100713	100714	100714	I	1723	“ What feelings ? ”
100717	100734	100714	100714	I	1723	“ You do n’t have any feelings for me . You came here looking for sex ! ”
100735	100743	100744	100744	he	1256	“ I came here looking for you , ”
100753	100762	100744	100744	he	1256	“ But believe me , I regret it . ”
100763	100772	100773	100773	I	1723	“ I ca n’t do this , Enzo . ”
100783	100791	100792	100792	He	1256	“ Fuck , forget I said that . ”
100800	100807	100792	100792	He	1256	“ I did n’t mean it . ”
100808	100820	100821	100821	I	1723	“ Let ’s just end this here and now , okay ? ”
100824	100873	100874	100874	He	1256	“ Before we both say things just to hurt each other , things that we do n’t really mean ? We ’ve known from the start that we were never meant to be . It was just a piece of paper , remember ? Just a business deal . ”
100879	100882	100874	100874	He	1256	“ Yeah . ”
100883	100896	100792	100792	He	1256	“ I’m — I’m sorry I lied to you about the pills . ”
100897	100905	100874	100874	He	1256	“ I do n’t care about that . ”
100906	100932	100874	100874	He	1256	“ And I ’m sorry I left so suddenly . I did n’t do it to hurt you — I did it to save myself . ”
100933	100937	100938	100938	he	1256	“ From what ? ”
100945	100961	100938	100938	he	1256	“ I do n’t get why all of a sudden you ’re afraid of me . ”
101004	101045	101046	101046	He	1256	“ From falling deeper in love with you than I already am . From getting so attached to you that I ’d never be able to walk away . From the crushing heartbreak of having to endure you leaving me . ”
101059	101077	101046	101046	He	1256	“ Because you would have left , Enzo . Sooner or later , you would have left . ”
101089	101099	101078	101078	I	1723	“ I ca n’t give you what you want . ”
101123	101155	101156	101156	He	1256	“ And before I lose all self - respect and do something stupid like sleep with you anyway because I even miss the damn smolder , I need you to go . ”
102906	102909	102910	102910	I	1723	“ Hey , ”
102913	102917	102910	102910	I	1723	“ Griffin here ? ”
102918	102927	102928	102928	She	1472	“ No . He ’s at the store . ”
102939	102948	102928	102928	She	1472	“ But he should be back any minute . ”
102949	102964	102965	102965	She	1472	“ Can I come in ? I really need to talk to you guys . ”
102973	102976	102965	102965	She	1472	“ Okay . ”
102987	102998	102977	102977	I	1723	“ I take it you ’ve talked to Bianca today . ”
102999	103002	103003	103003	she	1472	“ Yes , ”
103023	103032	103017	103017	I	1723	“ Do you think I ’m an idiot ? ”
103045	103048	103033	103033	She	1472	“ Yes . ”
103059	103071	103051	103051	I	1723	“ I need advice , Blair . I ’m fucking miserable . ”
103072	103089	103099	103099	She	1472	“ I can tell . You look like you have n’t eaten or slept in days . ”
103090	103098	103099	103099	She	1472	“ I ’m not sure I have . ”
103107	103116	103099	103099	She	1472	“ Stay for dinner . Want a beer ? ”
103117	103125	103126	103126	She	1472	“ Yes , please . Thank you . ”
103175	103178	103179	103179	he	225	“ Hey , ”
103182	103187	103188	103188	Blair	1472	“ What ’s up ? ”
103196	103214	103215	103215	Griffin	225	“ He came for advice , but I need to feed him too . He looks awful . ”
103220	103226	103227	103227	I	1723	“ What ’s going on ? ”
103232	103239	103227	103227	I	1723	“ I fucked up with Bianca . ”
103240	103243	103244	103244	He	225	“ Again ? ”
103258	103268	103244	103244	He	225	“ I thought she broke things off last weekend . ”
103269	103307	103227	103227	I	1723	“ She did . But I went over there last night to give her some things she ’d left at my house , and maybe try to talk to her , and it did n’t go well . ”
103308	103320	103323	103323	Blair	1472	“ That ’s because you tried to do more than talk , ”
103338	103343	103333	103333	Griffin	225	“ Is that true ? ”
103344	103357	103358	103358	Blair	1472	“ Uh , yeah . My approach might have been a problem . ”
103367	103371	103358	103358	Blair	1472	“ You think ? ”
103372	103381	103382	103382	I	1723	“ Well , I could n’t help myself , ”
103386	103424	103425	103425	I	1723	“ I miss her , and I was all worked up because her brother had told me some bullshit about her going out every night , and I was picturing her talking to guys and getting jealous . ”
103436	103445	103446	103446	Griffin	225	“ Me ! Getting jealous of other guys ! ”
103449	103457	103446	103446	Griffin	225	“ What is the world coming to ? ”
103458	103485	103425	103425	I	1723	“ Fuck off . I ’m not used to this , okay ? I do n’t like missing her . I do n’t like this feeling . ”
103486	103492	103493	103493	he	225	“ What ’s the feeling ? ”
103502	103551	103552	103552	Griffin	225	“ I do n’t even know what to call it , but it ’s horrible . It feels like the worst flu I ’ve ever had . My chest hurts , my stomach is churning all the time , and my head is all foggy and fucked up . ”
103555	103563	103552	103552	Griffin	225	“ You ’re in love with her . ”
103564	103568	103570	103570	Blair	1472	“ For sure , ”
103590	103613	103581	103581	I	1723	“ I saw her in church this morning , and I could n’t even breathe . What am I going to do ? ”
103614	103619	103621	103621	Griffin	225	“ Get her back , ”
103623	103639	103621	103621	Griffin	225	“ She does n’t want me , Griff . She kicked me out last night . ”
103640	103647	103648	103648	Blair	1472	“ Because you did it wrong , ”
103666	103694	103621	103621	Griffin	225	“ You strutted in there like a peacock and expected her to just fall into bed with you . You did n’t tell her how you felt . ”
103695	103701	103702	103702	I	1723	“ Yes , I did , ”
103712	103720	103721	103721	I	1723	“ Okay , I sort of did , ”
103741	103747	103748	103748	Griffin	225	“ What did you say ? ”
103751	103783	103784	103784	Griffin	225	“ I told her I missed her — I said lots of nice things about missing her — but then she started in with all these questions , and I panicked . ”
103789	103795	103784	103784	Griffin	225	“ What kind of questions ? ”
103796	103802	103803	103803	I	1723	“ Like about the future , ”
103812	103902	103903	103903	I	1723	“ She asked where we ’d end up , and I did n’t know . I felt like she was expecting me to predict exactly what will happen . It ’s impossible , is n’t it ? How can you promise someone something like forever — until fucking death do you part — and not feel like you ’re just gambling on it ? To me , it seems like building a house without a blueprint . Hmm , let ’s just start laying bricks and see what happens . ”
103908	103932	103903	103903	I	1723	“ It ’s madness . And yet . . . I ca n’t see forever without her . I do n’t want to . ”
103933	103941	103942	103942	Blair	1472	“ You ’re not wrong , Enzo , ”
103955	103979	103980	103980	I	1723	“ It is a kind of madness . And it is a gamble . You have to be willing to take a risk . ”
103983	104020	103980	103980	I	1723	“ Even if I am willing , how do I convince her to give me another chance ? She keeps pushing me away . Even after she said she loved me , she pushed me away . ”
104021	104029	104030	104030	Blair	1472	“ Okay , but think about that , ”
104037	104081	104082	104082	I	1723	“ Let ’s say she ’s being honest about her feelings — because I think she is . She does love you . She did n’t want to , but she does . So why do you think she would push you away ? ”
104090	104097	104082	104082	I	1723	“ I have no fucking idea . ”
104098	104104	104105	104105	I	1723	“ I bet you do . ”
104111	104141	104142	104142	Blair	1472	“ You sound just like my mother . If I had all these answers , I would n’t be so miserable trying to read her mind — or yours ! ”
104156	104205	104142	104142	Blair	1472	“ Look , I ’m trying to navigate this without betraying my friend . I ’m sorry it ’s frustrating for you . But I really think you can piece together why Bianca believes breaking it off with you now will save her a lot of heartache later . ”
104216	104224	104206	104206	I	1723	“ She did say this one thing . ”
104225	104230	104231	104231	Griffin	225	“ What was it ? ”
104234	104248	104249	104249	Griffin	225	“ She said that she had to leave me before I left her . ”
104254	104264	104249	104249	Griffin	225	“ Why does she think you ’d leave her ? ”
104265	104278	104279	104279	I	1723	“ I got the feeling it was because of the baby thing , ”
104287	104310	104279	104279	I	1723	“ She does n’t think she can get pregnant , and maybe she ’s afraid I ’d leave her because of it . ”
104311	104314	104315	104315	Blair	1472	“ Bingo . ”
104320	104365	104315	104315	Blair	1472	“ And Enzo , as much as I want you two to end up together , I think you have to ask yourself that question . If you want your own biological kids and Bianca ca n’t get pregnant , that ’s an issue . ”
104452	104458	104459	104459	I	1723	“ I do want kids , ”
104473	104491	104459	104459	I	1723	“ But I want them with her , no matter what . Nothing feels right without her . ”
104492	104501	104502	104502	she	1327	“ I think she needs to hear that , ”
104506	104515	104516	104516	She	1327	“ But what if she rejects me again ? ”
104519	104531	104532	104532	I	1723	“ Do it right this time , and she wo n’t . ”
104535	104548	104549	104549	She	1327	“ The good thing is , you ’re already married to her . ”
104553	104560	104561	104561	I	1723	“ No , I ’m not , ”
104564	104574	104561	104561	I	1723	“ That wedding was bullshit . Everything was bullshit . ”
104575	104580	104561	104561	I	1723	“ I was there . ”
104581	104586	104587	104587	I	1723	“ Then you know . ”
104594	104607	104587	104587	I	1723	“ It ’s not what she deserved . None of it was . ”
104608	104624	104625	104625	Blair	1472	“ Then do it all again , and give her what she deserves this time , ”
104628	104652	104653	104653	I	1723	“ Change all the things you messed up . Say all the things you should have said . Make it real this time . ”
104659	104668	104669	104669	She	1327	“ That ’s actually a really great idea . ”
104674	104678	104669	104669	She	1327	“ Thank you . ”
104698	104718	104681	104681	her	1327	“ But if you hurt her again , Enzo Moretti , I will hunt you down and destroy you . ”
104719	104728	104729	104729	I	1723	“ I ’m not going to hurt her , ”
104737	104758	104729	104729	I	1723	“ I ’m just going to get her back . But I might need help . Yours and Cheyenne ’s . ”
104759	104768	104775	104775	she	1327	“ Whatever you need , we ’re there . ”
104789	104803	104775	104775	she	1327	“ But mostly , we just want to tell her we were right . ”
104843	104853	104835	104835	she	256	“ Well ? Did you do what I said ? ”
104854	104858	104859	104859	She	256	“ Not yet . ”
104862	104887	104888	104888	She	256	“ I need to talk to Dad , okay ? I ca n’t do anything until I clear my conscience about lying to him . ”
104898	104936	104893	104893	she	256	“ He ’s in his office . I do n’t know why he calls it retirement since he still gets up early , takes his coffee into his office , and stays at his desk for hours . ”
104964	104967	104955	104955	I	1723	“ Thanks . ”
104983	104993	104999	104999	his	1435	“ It ’s me . Can I come in ? ”
105022	105025	105019	105019	YOUR	1723	“ Sure . ”
105045	105051	105019	105019	YOUR	1723	“ How are you feeling ? ”
105052	105055	105056	105056	He	1435	“ Good . ”
105080	105089	105072	105072	I	1723	“ So I need to tell you something . ”
105090	105093	105019	105019	YOUR	1723	“ Okay . ”
105094	105099	105072	105072	I	1723	“ I fucked up . ”
105111	105144	105072	105072	I	1723	“ I did something I ’m not proud of , and I need to come clean about it to you before I can fix things with Bianca — this involves her too . ”
105145	105150	105072	105072	I	1723	“ I ’m listening . ”
105151	105166	105167	105167	I	1723	“ I only married her so you would n’t give the company to Pietro . ”
105174	105186	105187	105187	He	1336	“ I know it was wrong , and I ’m sorry . ”
105202	105230	105191	105191	I	1723	“ It was dishonest and shady , and that ’s not the kind of man I am . It ’s not the kind of man you raised . ”
105231	105238	105187	105187	He	1336	“ No , it is n’t . ”
105239	105264	105265	105265	He	1336	“ If you want to turn Moretti & Sons over to Pietro , I ’ll understand . And I ’ll help him run it . ”
105276	105288	105265	105265	He	1336	“ I was never going to give the company to Pietro . ”
105289	105292	105191	105191	I	1723	“ Huh ? ”
105293	105313	105191	105191	I	1723	“ Your brother is good at a lot of things . Being CEO would not be one of them . ”
105314	105345	105346	105346	I	1723	“ So . . . so I did n’t need to get married and start a family in order to prove that I was responsible enough to run the company ? ”
105349	105393	105394	105394	He	1336	“ No . You needed to get married and start a family because that ’s what you want out of life . And you were never going to do it if you did n’t sense some kind of pressure to get it done . ”
105397	105431	105432	105432	I	1723	“ That ’s the way it always is with Moretti men . We like our independence too much . We ’re selfish and stubborn . We need a shove in the right direction . ”
105437	105446	105432	105432	I	1723	“ So I did all this for nothing ? ”
105451	105510	105511	105511	I	1723	“ Are you listening to me ? You did it because deep down , you wanted to . You were tired of being alone . You were ready for a family . But like all Moretti men , you needed a push , so I gave it to you — just like my father gave it to me . ”
105582	105588	105589	105589	I	1723	“ Maybe you ’re right , ”
105593	105600	105602	105602	he	658	“ Of course I ’m right . ”
105607	105637	105602	105602	he	658	“ You think I did n’t see what you were doing ? I raised you . I taught you everything you know . And I was n’t born yesterday . ”
105638	105653	105654	105654	He	658	“ You knew I was n’t in love with Bianca when I married her ? ”
105659	105667	105654	105654	He	658	“ Why did n’t you say anything ? ”
105668	105675	105602	105602	he	658	“ Because I had a feeling . ”
105676	105680	105654	105654	He	658	“ What feeling ? ”
105688	105739	105743	105743	him	658	“ That she was the one for you . I saw it that night at the table when you announced your engagement . I was n’t sure what kind of game you two were playing , but I saw pretty clearly how it would end as long as nobody interfered . ”
105747	105758	105740	105740	I	1723	“ She is the one . I see it now . ”
105759	105776	105740	105740	I	1723	“ Better late than never , I guess . Now go make sure she knows it . ”
105796	105838	105839	105839	His	658	“ You have to say the words , son . And you have to mean what you say . Bianca ’s the kind of girl who will see right through your bullshit — that ’s why she ’s perfect for you . ”
105845	105849	105839	105839	His	658	“ I know . ”
105850	105892	105893	105893	I	1723	“ Good . Now get the fuck out of here , and do n’t come back until you ’ve made things right with your wife — and get used to doing it , by the way . That ’s married life . ”
105896	105904	105893	105893	I	1723	“ Thanks , Pop . For everything . ”
106748	106753	106742	106742	He	83	“ You look great , ”
106763	106770	106754	106754	Blair	1472	“ Is that a new dress ? ”
106787	106805	106806	106806	Blair	1472	“ Yeah . I felt like I needed to get out of my all - black rut . ”
106809	106835	106836	106836	I	1723	“ It was a long winter , was n’t it ? But this summer will be great . We have lots to look forward to . ”
106854	106865	106842	106842	Blair	1472	“ Shoot . I do n’t see any parking spaces . ”
106866	106873	106874	106874	I	1723	“ There ’s one over there , ”
106882	106907	106874	106874	I	1723	“ But you ’re wearing heels , and that ’s a long walk . Why do n’t you jump out and grab our table ? ”
106908	106922	106923	106923	I	1723	“ Blair , do n’t be silly . They ’re not that high . ”
106938	106945	106874	106874	I	1723	“ I ’ll walk with you . ”
106946	106949	106950	106950	she	1723	“ No ! ”
106959	106965	106955	106955	she	1723	“ I mean , no . ”
106971	106994	106995	106995	I	1723	“ You go in . We ’re a little late already , and I bet Cheyenne is in there waiting for us . ”
106998	107007	107008	107008	She	1723	“ Okay . I ’ll see you inside . ”
107015	107024	107008	107008	She	1723	“ Yes , good . See you inside . ”
107142	107154	107126	107127	The hostess	1431	“ Hi , Mrs. Moretti . Your table is all set . ”
107165	107175	107155	107155	I	1723	“ Uh , thanks . Is my friend here ? ”
107176	107179	107180	107180	she	1431	“ Yes , ”
107186	107191	107180	107180	she	1431	“ Right this way . ”
107368	107371	107360	107360	His	219	“ Hi . ”
107372	107377	107378	107378	I	1723	“ What is this ? ”
107418	107423	107412	107412	he	219	“ Thanks , Victoria . ”
107424	107432	107433	107433	She	1366	“ You ’re welcome , Mr. Moretti . ”
107460	107466	107448	107448	Enzo	256	“ Will you sit down ? ”
107488	107503	107504	107504	Enzo	256	“ I do n’t know . What ’s going on ? Where is Cheyenne ? ”
107510	107516	107504	107504	Enzo	256	“ They ’re not here . ”
107517	107522	107448	107448	Enzo	256	“ They ’re not ? ”
107523	107555	107504	107504	Enzo	256	“ No , I just needed their help getting you here . I did n’t think you ’d come if I asked you myself , and I wanted to surprise you . ”
107556	107566	107567	107567	I	1723	“ Well , it worked . I ’m surprised . ”
107578	107589	107567	107567	I	1723	“ But I ’m also upset . I feel tricked . ”
107598	107633	107634	107634	He	1377	“ Don’t — it ’s not like that , I promise . Just please sit . Give me five minutes , and if you still want to leave , I wo n’t fight you . ”
107681	107689	107690	107690	I	1723	“ I do n’t owe you anything , ”
107708	107715	107716	107716	He	1377	“ No , you do n’t . ”
107729	107747	107716	107716	He	1377	“ But I owe you something . Please give me another chance to give it to you . ”
107795	107799	107800	107800	he	1377	“ Thank you , ”
107821	107827	107812	107812	He	1377	“ That ’s for you . ”
107828	107833	107834	107834	I	1723	“ I ’m fine , ”
107846	107857	107858	107858	He	1377	“ What is it that you think you owe me ? ”
107964	107969	107949	107949	My	1723	“ What is that ? ”
107970	108015	108016	108016	He	1377	“ That is a very close — as close as I could get inside a week — approximation of the ring your great - grandfather the bootlegger gave to your great - grandmother . . . with a slightly bigger diamond , of course . ”
108024	108031	108016	108016	He	1377	“ Oh my God . Enzo . ”
108041	108052	108053	108053	he	1377	“ What I owe you is the truth , Bianca , ”
108062	108176	108177	108177	He	1380	“ All my life , I did n’t think it would matter who I married . I wanted kids for the sake of carrying on tradition and the experience of fatherhood , but it was n’t until I fell in love with you that I understood what that really means . I do n’t just want to have children so I can be a dad — I want to have children with you . I want to raise a family with you . And when it ’s just us again in that big old Center Avenue house , I want to sit on the porch in a rocking chair and argue with you . ”
108214	108219	108220	108220	he	1380	“ I love you , ”
108235	108269	108220	108220	he	1380	“ More than I ’ve ever loved anything or anyone . I ’m sorry I made you wait to hear it . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . ”
108270	108274	108275	108275	I	1723	“ But Enzo . ”
108282	108291	108292	108292	He	1380	“ I might not be able to have — ”
108302	108311	108292	108292	He	1380	“ We ’re a family no matter what . ”
108324	108330	108319	108319	he	1380	“ Do you mean it ? ”
108331	108334	108335	108335	He	1380	“ Yes . ”
108343	108402	108335	108335	He	1380	“ You ’re the most beautiful , the most caring , and the most exasperating woman I ’ve ever known . You can infuriate me like no one else — but you make me happier than anyone else ever could . And the love I feel for you is the truest , realest thing I ’ve ever known . ”
108416	108422	108335	108335	He	1380	“ I love you too . ”
108423	108461	108462	108462	I	1723	“ I want a love story like your great - grandparents — one that will outlast our time on earth , one that our great - grandkids will still be talking about a hundred years from now . ”
108472	108478	108462	108462	I	1723	“ I want that too . ”
108479	108485	108488	108488	I	1723	“ Will you marry me ? ”
108493	108501	108488	108488	I	1723	“ I ’m already married to you . ”
108502	108523	108462	108462	I	1723	“ But you deserved a better proposal . So what do you say ? Still want to be my wife ? ”
108524	108527	108528	108528	I	1723	“ Yes , ”
108546	108549	108550	108550	He	1381	“ Yes . ”
108567	108572	108550	108550	He	1381	“ She said yes ! ”
108599	108602	108603	108603	he	1381	“ Whew , ”
108613	108618	108603	108603	he	1381	“ I ’m sweating . ”
108619	108632	108633	108633	I	1723	“ Why ? Did you think I was going to say no ? ”
108648	108651	108652	108652	He	1381	“ Honestly ? ”
108655	108676	108652	108652	He	1381	“ No . I figured you ’d say yes . But I ’d have deserved it if you said no . ”
108688	108698	108677	108677	I	1723	“ Oh , good . You ’re still you . ”
108699	108705	108706	108706	His	1381	“ I ’m still me . ”
108741	108750	108720	108720	Blair	1472	“ We heard cheering ! Did it happen ? ”
108751	108755	108756	108756	I	1723	“ It happened , ”
108781	108790	108769	108769	They	1384	“ Oh my God , it ’s beautiful ! ”
108796	108802	108791	108791	Blair	1472	“ This is the replica ? ”
108803	108808	108809	108809	Enzo	256	“ It ’s close , ”
108812	108825	108826	108826	His	1381	“ My cousin Paulie did the best he could on short notice . ”
108831	108839	108826	108826	His	1381	“ I was n’t willing to wait . ”
108840	108847	108848	108848	Cheyenne	1472	“ I love everything about it , ”
108897	108922	108923	108923	she	1472	“ We ’ll leave you to your dinner , but we ’re all at the bar if you guys want to join us afterward , ”
108926	108931	108932	108932	I	1723	“ Who ’s we ? ”
108935	108944	108945	108945	Blair	1472	“ Just Griffin , Cole , and Beckett . ”
108951	108961	108962	108962	I	1723	“ We were n’t allowed to tell anyone else . ”
108965	108977	108962	108962	I	1723	“ Okay , we ’ll head in there after we eat . ”
108978	108981	108982	108982	She	1472	“ Perfect . ”
109006	109018	108982	108982	She	1472	“ Also — and we mean this in the nicest way — ”
109019	109024	109026	109026	Cheyenne	1472	“ Told you so , ”
109045	109061	109040	109040	I	1723	“ Those two are ridiculous . They were convinced all along that this would happen . ”
109062	109068	109069	109069	Enzo	256	“ They ’re good friends , ”
109077	109101	109069	109069	Enzo	256	“ And they love you . You do n’t even want to know about the threats they issued if I fucked this up . ”
109102	109109	109110	109110	I	1723	“ I can just about imagine , ”
109113	109123	109110	109110	I	1723	“ What did Blair say to you just now ? ”
109124	109138	109139	109139	I	1723	“ She said she was glad she did n’t have to kill me . ”
109144	109154	109139	109139	I	1723	“ We ’re lucky to have such great friends . ”
109155	109162	109163	109163	He	1387	“ We ’re lucky , period . ”
109170	109180	109163	109163	He	1387	“ And I ’ll never take this for granted . ”
109265	109274	109275	109275	he	1387	“ But it ’ll be dark by then , ”
109278	109284	109285	109285	I	1723	“ I wo n’t care , ”
109288	109296	109285	109285	I	1723	“ I want to see it tonight . ”
109371	109376	109378	109378	Griffin	225	“ To old friends , ”
109380	109385	109387	109387	Blair	1472	“ And new ones ! ”
109389	109394	109396	109396	Cole	81	“ To second chances , ”
109403	109408	109410	109410	Beckett	1537	“ And second basemen , ”
109421	109425	109426	109426	I	1723	“ Per cent'anni , ”
109466	109484	109459	109459	Enzo	256	“ To the best friends a guy could ask for . . . and fuck the Mavs . ”
109504	109509	109510	109510	Cheyenne	1472	“ Old man baseball , ”
109516	109523	109510	109510	Cheyenne	1472	“ Better get used to it . ”
109544	109554	109539	109539	Enzo	256	“ Come on . We have to be somewhere . ”
109555	109559	109560	109560	I	1723	“ We do ? ”
109570	109573	109563	109563	he	225	“ Where ? ”
109574	109579	109580	109580	I	1723	“ You ’ll see . ”
109626	109631	109620	109620	I	1723	“ What ’s this ? ”
109666	109673	109658	109658	he	225	“ Enzo , what is this ? ”
109702	109706	109710	109710	he	225	“ Come on . ”
109807	109810	109802	109802	He	1435	“ Welcome . ”
109811	109819	109820	109820	Enzo	256	“ Thank you for this , Father , ”
109823	109831	109820	109820	Enzo	256	“ Of course . Are you ready ? ”
109832	109838	109839	109839	Enzo	256	“ Give me one second . ”
109849	109887	109888	109888	He	1435	“ I know we ’re technically already married . But we did that for a piece of paper . For an audience . And definitely for the wrong reasons . I wanted to do something more meaningful . ”
109896	109968	109888	109888	He	1435	“ My great - grandparents donated these windows when the church was being built a hundred years ago . I ’ve looked at them a thousand times and never thought twice about them . But now when I see them , they remind me of the importance of family , of putting down roots , and of having faith in something bigger than ourselves . And that ’s because of you . ”
109982	109996	109997	109997	he	1435	“ I asked Father Mike here tonight to give our marriage a blessing , ”
110001	110042	109997	109997	he	1435	“ I did n’t want to do it before — neither of us did — because it would have felt wrong . And it would have been because our parents pressured us into it . This is just between us . ”
110043	110047	110048	110049	Father Mike	1435	“ And God , ”
110052	110057	110059	110059	Enzo	256	“ Oh , right , ”
110061	110065	110059	110059	Enzo	256	“ Him too . ”
110071	110081	110066	110066	I	1723	“ I love it . And I love you . ”
110082	110088	110093	110093	he	1435	“ I love you too . ”
110118	110125	110109	110109	he	1435	“ Okay , we ’re ready . ”
110200	110205	110206	110206	Enzo	256	“ Do n’t worry , ”
110213	110228	110206	110206	Enzo	256	“ There ’s a lot more work to do to get this place livable . ”
110251	110260	110245	110245	I	1723	“ We ’re really going to live here ? ”
110261	110267	110268	110268	His	1504	“ Of course we are . ”
110274	110280	110268	110268	His	1504	“ And have a family ? ”
110281	110318	110326	110326	I	1723	“ Of course we are . If biology is n’t on our side , we ’ll adopt . I do n’t care how we get our family , I just want to have one with you . ”
110338	110350	110351	110351	he	1504	“ We ’re going to be happy here , Mrs. Moretti , ”
110360	110397	110351	110351	he	1504	“ We ’re going to fill this house with a bunch of noisy , messy kids who are going to drive us crazy , but we ’re going to be happy . I can feel it . ”
110406	110412	110398	110398	I	1723	“ I feel it too . ”
110510	110517	110518	110518	he	1504	“ God , I missed you , ”
110534	110542	110518	110518	he	1504	“ Do n’t ever leave me again . ”
110543	110548	110518	110518	he	1504	“ I wo n’t . ”
110562	110579	110551	110551	I	1723	“ You ’re stuck with me now . God says . And the state of Michigan . ”
110580	110583	110518	110518	he	1504	“ Good . ”
110584	110604	110605	110605	He	1504	“ Plus my ring says a hundred years . So I figure I should at least honor that promise . ”
110616	110640	110641	110641	I	1723	“ You better . I do n’t want to be without you . I do n’t even feel like me without you anymore . ”
110644	110651	110641	110641	I	1723	“ You could n’t even smolder ? ”
110652	110660	110641	110641	I	1723	“ I could n’t even fucking smolder . ”
110672	110685	110641	110641	I	1723	“ That is a clear sign that we ’d better stick together . ”
110686	110721	110641	110641	I	1723	“ Damn right . After all , I need to pass that on to future generations of Morettis . Even if I do n’t pass it through DNA , it can still be taught . ”
110722	110734	110641	110641	I	1723	“ I have no doubt our boys will inherit the smolder . ”
110735	110755	110641	110641	I	1723	“ And our girls will inherit the moxie . It ’s what made me fall in love with you . ”
110783	110791	110792	110792	I	1723	“ Did you mean what you said ? ”
110803	110807	110792	110792	I	1723	“ About adoption ? ”
110808	110814	110815	110815	I	1723	“ Of course I did . ”
110822	110844	110815	110815	I	1723	“ I have n’t made up my mind yet about trying again with Clomid . I ’m taking a little break . ”
110845	110848	110849	110849	he	1504	“ Good , ”
110852	110889	110815	110815	I	1723	“ You deserve some time to breathe . And whatever you decide — Clomid , turkey baster , adoption , kidnapping — I’m with you . We ’re a family , no matter what , remember ? ”
110890	110894	110895	110895	He	1504	“ I remember . ”
110903	110908	110909	110909	I	1723	“ Night , Lucy . ”
110912	110917	110909	110909	I	1723	“ Night , Ricky . ”
110925	110935	110924	110924	Enzo	256	“ I ’m sorry , what did you say ? ”
110959	110966	110949	110949	She	256	“ There are two heartbeats here . ”
110967	110972	110974	110974	Bianca	1472	“ Oh my God , ”
110980	110997	110974	110974	Bianca	1472	“ What do you mean , two heartbeats ? Why would the baby have two heartbeats ? ”
111007	111013	110998	110999	The tech	1409	“ There are two babies . ”
111014	111021	111022	111022	I	1723	“ But we only ordered one , ”
111029	111033	111035	111036	the tech	1409	“ It happens , ”
111038	111041	111042	111042	She	256	“ See ? ”
111080	111085	111086	111086	I	1723	“ Those flickering things , ”
111095	111100	111086	111086	I	1723	“ Those are hearts ? ”
111101	111108	111109	111109	My	1723	“ They sure are , Dad . ”
111134	111137	111138	111138	I	1723	“ Two , ”
111141	111144	111145	111145	she	1472	“ Two , ”
111188	111193	111194	111194	I	1723	“ Well , damn , ”
111197	111202	111203	111203	Bianca	1472	“ Talk about overachieving . ”
111206	111214	111203	111203	Bianca	1472	“ Pretty sure it was the Clomid . ”
111215	111232	111233	111234	the tech	1409	“ Even with Clomid , the chances of twins are n’t that high when conceived naturally , ”
111237	111249	111233	111234	the tech	1409	“ I think it ’s something like five to ten percent . ”
111250	111253	111254	111254	I	1723	“ See ? ”
111295	111302	111303	111303	She	1472	“ You ’re a rock star . ”
111330	111336	111327	111327	she	1472	“ Does everything look okay ? ”
111337	111342	111343	111343	she	1472	“ Everything looks great , ”
111366	111370	111371	111371	she	1472	“ Thank you , ”
111420	111450	111451	111451	She	1472	“ I still ca n’t believe it . How on earth are two humans going to grow in there ? It does n’t seem like there ’s enough room . ”
111454	111465	111451	111451	She	1472	“ Um , I ’m going to get really big . ”
111466	111471	111472	111472	I	1723	“ Like how big ? ”
111480	111493	111494	111494	I	1723	“ Massive . Like I could be wider than I am tall . ”
111500	111503	111494	111494	I	1723	“ No . ”
111504	111513	111494	111494	I	1723	“ Yes . Will you still love me ? ”
111514	111518	111519	111519	I	1723	“ Even more . ”
111540	111546	111530	111530	She	1472	“ What are you doing ? ”
111547	111566	111567	111567	She	1472	“ I ’m listening to them . It ’s never too early to start eavesdropping on our kids . ”
111570	111575	111567	111567	She	1472	“ Hear anything good ? ”
111576	111579	111530	111530	She	1472	“ Shh . ”
111585	111590	111591	111591	she	1472	“ Girls or boys ? ”
111594	111599	111591	111591	she	1472	“ One of each . ”
111600	111603	111530	111530	She	1472	“ Really ? ”
111604	111607	111591	111591	she	1472	“ Yes . ”
111608	111615	111591	111591	she	1472	“ And what are their names ? ”
111616	111624	111530	111530	She	1472	“ Ricky and Lucy , of course . ”
111625	111629	111630	111630	She	1472	“ Of course . ”
111633	111640	111630	111630	She	1472	“ What are they up to ? ”
111641	111673	111591	111591	she	1472	“ They ’re arguing . Ricky is taking up too much space . Lucy drew a line and told him not to cross it , but Ricky likes to provoke her . ”
111674	111679	111630	111630	She	1472	“ Sounds about right . ”
111680	111685	111686	111686	I	1723	“ Are you happy ? ”
111702	111706	111696	111696	She	1472	“ Are you ? ”
111707	111727	111591	111591	she	1472	“ More than I ever thought possible . And I know it ’s just going to keep getting better . ”
111728	111734	111630	111630	She	1472	“ I ’m scared too . ”
111740	111743	111744	111744	She	1472	“ Why ? ”
111747	111777	111744	111744	She	1472	“ All of this . . . You , the house , the babies . It ’s everything I ’ve ever wanted . I ’m scared of losing it . ”
111778	111784	111785	111785	I	1723	“ Hey . Come here . ”
111795	111805	111785	111785	I	1723	“ Nothing can take away what we ’ve got . ”
111806	111811	111744	111744	She	1472	“ But what if — ”
111812	111825	111744	111744	She	1472	“ You talk too much . Have I ever told you that ? ”
111826	111829	111785	111785	I	1723	“ Probably . ”
111830	111884	111885	111885	She	1472	“ And you ’re always leaving your books in piles around the house , you constantly rearrange shit in the kitchen so I ca n’t find anything , you ’re a big know - it - all , and you turn the thermostat up so high it ’s like a sauna in here . ”
111888	111891	111885	111885	She	1472	“ Sorry . ”
111892	111897	111898	111898	I	1723	“ Do n’t be . ”
111903	111929	111898	111898	I	1723	“ Because you ’re also my favorite person in the world . You brought light into the egotistical and immature darkness that was my soul . ”
111930	111938	111939	111939	she	1472	“ That ’s right , I did , ”
111945	111964	111898	111898	I	1723	“ Plus you ’re the best wife ever . And you ’re going to be an amazing mom . ”
111965	111970	111885	111885	She	1472	“ You think so ? ”
111971	111976	111977	111977	I	1723	“ I know it . ”
111980	112008	111977	111977	I	1723	“ And I ’m always right . In addition to being so good - looking and awesome at baseball , that ’s your favorite thing about me . ”
112009	112015	111898	111898	I	1723	“ It ’s really not . ”
112016	112019	112020	112020	I	1723	“ What ? ”
112024	112037	112020	112020	I	1723	“ Come on . What could you love more than those things ? ”
112038	112147	111977	111977	I	1723	“ Hmmm . I love how generous you are . How hard you work . How you treat everyone you meet with kindness . I love the way you can make me laugh so easily . I love that you have the same three best friends now that you had when you were twelve — that says you ’re loyal and trustworthy . I love the way you smell . I love how protective you are . I love walking into a room with you and seeing everyone stare because you ’re so gorgeous , and feeling your hand on my back that tells me you ’re mine . ”
112148	112151	112152	112152	I	1723	“ Always , ”
112159	112162	112163	112163	she	1723	“ And , ”
112175	112186	112163	112163	she	1723	“ I suppose I have grown to love the smolder . ”
112190	112201	112202	112202	She	1723	“ It was only a matter of time , babe . ”
112222	112236	112202	112202	She	1723	“ For once , I do n’t even want to argue with you . ”
112237	112240	112241	112241	I	1723	“ Good . ”
