463	467	468	468	I	441	“ Cheese toasts ! ”
471	485	486	486	I	441	“ My avocado , pomegranate , and chèvre crostini are not cheese toasts ! ”
505	508	509	509	she	2105	“ Hello ? ”
525	533	534	534	I	441	“ I did not serve anything soggy ! ”
537	549	534	534	I	441	“ What are you talking about ? What time is it ? ”
550	572	509	509	she	2105	“ It ’s eight - thirty . The bride from last night left a shitty review on my Dearly Beloved page ! ”
573	577	578	578	Millie	2105	“ She did ? ”
583	594	578	578	Millie	2105	“ Yes ! A totally horrible one - star review . ”
595	605	606	606	I	441	“ Hang on . Let me grab my laptop . ”
651	656	657	657	Millie	2105	“ Oh , Jesus , ”
660	678	657	657	Millie	2105	“ This is bonkers . She told me when she left how happy she was with everything . ”
685	705	679	680	My sister	234	“ ‘ Even the meatballs did not have meat ? ’ They were vegetarian ! What did she expect ? ”
706	714	657	657	Millie	2105	“ It ’s not funny , Mills . ”
751	756	757	757	Millie	2105	“ You know what ? ”
760	776	778	778	she	2105	“ I have a notification that Cloverleigh Farms has a new Dearly Beloved review too . ”
781	809	778	778	she	2105	“ Looks like she was busy this morning . Why is she online posting bullshit reviews ? Should n’t she be packing for her honeymoon or something ? ”
810	816	778	778	she	2105	“ What does yours say ? ”
817	909	910	910	My	441	“ It says , ‘ The peonies were wilted , the cheese toasts were soggy , the staff was rude , and the vodka was watered down . Everything was cheap cheap cheap even though I paid top dollar . I do n’t know how this place has so many great reviews , they ruined my wedding . My ceremony was n’t even in the place they ’d promised me it would be . I want a refund . ’ That last sentence is in all caps , by the way . ”
920	929	910	910	My	441	“ Those . Were not . Cheese toasts ! ”
930	933	934	934	Millie	2105	“ Relax , ”
937	949	934	934	Millie	2105	“ It ’s obviously just an attempt at a money grab . ”
950	978	910	910	My	441	“ But people on this app do n’t know that , Millie . They just see a one - star review and assume I serve bad food ! ”
979	1016	934	934	Millie	2105	“ Who ’s really going to listen to a woman who refers to herself as ‘ He Put a Big Ass Ring On It ? ’ Right there , it ’s obvious her taste is questionable . ”
1017	1024	1025	1025	I	441	“ Easy for you to say . ”
1051	1095	1042	1042	I	441	“ Cloverleigh Farms has been around forever , and its reputation is established . It has a bajillion great reviews on Dearly Beloved already , but The Veggie Vixen is brand new — and now my only review says yucky and just ew ! ”
1096	1147	910	910	My	441	“ If it bothers you that much , then respond to it . Apologize for her negative experience , say you always want your customers to be happy , and suggest she contact you directly . And if she really wants her money back , just give it to her . ”
1148	1157	1158	1158	I	441	“ I ’m going to be broke forever , ”
1168	1204	1205	1205	I	441	“ No , you wo n’t . You started a business . That means costs up front , but you ’re good , Felicity . You ’ll make money . What ’s all that noise ? ”
1210	1220	1205	1205	I	441	“ I ’m in the bathroom looking for something . ”
1221	1229	910	910	My	441	“ Not the scissors , I hope . ”
1230	1244	910	910	My	441	“ You deal with stress your way , I deal with it mine . ”
1245	1261	1205	1205	I	441	“ Felicity MacAllister , do not cut your hair . It ’s just one app . ”
1262	1306	1307	1307	I	441	“ But it ’s the most important one for getting catering gigs and you know it . Engagement parties , showers , bridal luncheons — all those are booked through Dearly Beloved . Even people planning non - wedding events use that app . ”
1476	1488	1490	1490	Millie	2105	“ You ’ve got like two thousand followers on your Instagram , ”
1496	1502	1490	1490	Millie	2105	“ That ’s a lot . ”
1503	1517	1490	1490	Millie	2105	“ Not really . And that ’s not the same as a review . ”
1557	1620	1540	1540	I	441	“ Reviews are what bring in new business . I ’ve been working my ass off to gain traction , and this just set me back at the starting line — no , it ’s worse than that ! At least when I started out , I was on neutral ground . Now I ’m on soggy ground . I ’m sinking ! ”
1621	1634	1540	1540	I	441	“ You ’re fine . Do you need me to come over ? ”
1635	1692	1540	1540	I	441	“ I ’m not fine . I ’m humiliated and penniless , I ’ll never be able to move out of Dad and Frannie ’s house , and I can kiss the idea of getting a cookbook deal goodbye . I have failed at my dreams , Millicent . But at least I found the scissors . ”
1693	1700	1701	1701	I	441	“ Do n’t do anything rash ! ”
1725	1729	1540	1540	I	441	“ Too late . ”
1730	1738	1739	1739	Millie	2105	“ No ! Stop cutting your hair ! ”
1749	1761	1747	1747	her	2105	“ Relax , I ’m just giving myself a little trim . ”
1781	1786	1768	1768	I	441	“ Bangs are in . ”
1787	1795	1747	1747	her	2105	“ Not bangs ! Anything but bangs ! ”
1796	1807	1808	1808	I	441	“ I got ta go . I need a mirror . ”
1939	1944	1945	1945	I	441	“ Oh , shit . ”
1963	1966	1945	1945	I	441	“ Shit ! ”
2245	2258	2259	2259	God	63	“ Wow . You ’ve come a long way since high school . ”
2518	2521	2513	2513	I	441	“ Hey . ”
2522	2526	2513	2513	I	441	“ Did you ? ”
2527	2530	2513	2513	I	441	“ Yes . ”
2531	2539	2540	2540	I	441	“ Your reunion is tonight , right ? ”
2547	2550	2540	2540	I	441	“ Yes . ”
2551	2582	2513	2513	I	441	“ Why do n’t I pick you up and we ’ll go downtown , grab some coffee , and beg a salon to fit you in for an emergency appointment ? ”
2583	2591	2592	2592	I	441	“ It ’s not really an emergency , ”
2601	2615	2592	2592	I	441	“ Is it better or worse than Dad and Frannie ’s wedding day ? ”
2616	2619	2620	2620	I	441	“ Worse , ”
2623	2633	2620	2620	I	441	“ But better than the night before the SATs . ”
2634	2640	2641	2641	she	2105	“ Send me a pic , ”
2653	2662	2650	2650	I	441	“ That ’s probably not a good idea . ”
2663	2669	2620	2620	I	441	“ Send me a pic . ”
2670	2677	2678	2678	I	441	“ Fine , but be nice . ”
2706	2710	2702	2703	My sister	234	“ Sweet Jesus . ”
2711	2717	2620	2620	I	441	“ I said be nice ! ”
2718	2731	2732	2732	Millie	2105	“ Okay . Do n’t panic . What are you wearing tonight ? ”
2749	2755	2742	2742	her	2105	“ I do n’t know . ”
2764	2769	2742	2742	her	2105	“ Got any advice ? ”
2770	2795	2702	2703	My sister	234	“ Wear a fabulous short dress with a great pair of heels . Show off your legs . That will distract from your hair . ”
2796	2826	2827	2827	She	2105	“ I do n’t own fabulous dresses . I ’ve spent almost every night for the last five years in a kitchen . Can I borrow something from you ? ”
2830	2842	2827	2827	She	2105	“ Felicity , my dresses are not going to fit you . ”
2843	2850	2742	2742	her	2105	“ I could stuff my bra . ”
2851	2863	2864	2864	she	2105	“ You ’d have to stuff a lot more than that , ”
2899	2914	2891	2891	hers	2105	“ I wish I had a date tonight . That would make it easier . ”
2915	2931	2864	2864	she	2105	“ I ’ve got another wedding here , but maybe Winnie would go with you . ”
2932	2940	2941	2941	I	441	“ Show up with my little sister ? ”
2948	2956	2941	2941	I	441	“ That ’s worse than going alone . ”
2957	2962	2963	2963	My	441	“ What about Hutton ? ”
2972	2992	2963	2963	My	441	“ He said absolutely not the first time I asked . But I guess I could ask him again . ”
3260	3263	3254	3254	them	290	“ love notes ”
3419	3432	3416	3416	he	293	“ That was n’t as bad as I thought it would be . ”
3558	3567	3568	3568	Millie	2105	“ I ’d call him up right now , ”
3571	3577	3568	3568	Millie	2105	“ He hates the phone . ”
3578	3581	3568	3568	Millie	2105	“ Why ? ”
3582	3597	3598	3598	Millie	2105	“ Because it involves talking to people . He likes numbers more than words . ”
3601	3641	3598	3598	Millie	2105	“ Guess that ’s why he ’s a billionaire and we ’re us . Somebody asked me the other day what he does — everyone is talking about him — and I did n’t even know what to say . ”
3642	3669	3670	3670	I	441	“ My answer is always , ‘ He co - founded a cryptocurrency exchange called HFX . ’ But do n’t ask me to explain it . ”
3675	3690	3670	3670	I	441	“ Whenever he tries to tell me what it is , I get lost . ”
3691	3730	3731	3731	I	441	“ How can that be ? You ’re a math whiz too , Miss I Skipped First Grade . We all know you were doing complex algebraic equations when the rest of us were learning B says buh . ”
3740	3763	3731	3731	I	441	“ The kind of math Hutton does is way beyond algebra . You do n’t get to be a billionaire solving for x. ”
3764	3788	3789	3789	Millie	2105	“ Speaking of which , you ’d think a billionaire would want to spend his summer vacation somewhere more ritzy than northern Michigan , ”
3792	3829	3830	3830	I	441	“ Well , his family is here , and Hutton ’s not really the ritzy type — although I assure you , the place he ’s staying in is not your typical cabin in the woods , ”
3836	3876	3830	3830	I	441	“ It ’s got like four bedrooms , three decks , a gourmet kitchen , one of those indoor / outdoor fireplaces , cathedral ceilings , huge windows . When you look out , all you see are trees . ”
3877	3880	3881	3881	Her	2105	“ Nice . ”
3886	3895	3881	3881	Her	2105	“ Sounds like you ’re there a lot . ”
3896	3906	3907	3907	I	441	“ We hang out a few times a week , ”
4006	4015	4016	4016	she	305	“ A few times a week , huh ? ”
4019	4025	4016	4016	she	305	“ That sounds like dating . ”
4026	4034	4035	4035	I	441	“ No dating , we just hang . ”
4048	4093	4035	4035	I	441	“ He does n’t love going out in public , which was the case even before he was a celebrity , but now it ’s even worse . People just stare with no shame . Women flirt outrageously . Guys ask for stock tips . ”
4094	4097	4016	4016	she	305	“ Really ? ”
4098	4101	4102	4102	I	441	“ Yes . ”
4111	4171	4172	4172	Millie	2105	“ He runs in the park super early to avoid having to deal with people , but there ’s this group of old ladies who gather in the park to do their Prancercise , who call themselves the Prancin ’ Grannies , and they adore him . They prance right up to tell him all about their single granddaughters . ”
4175	4179	4172	4172	Millie	2105	“ Stop it . ”
4180	4188	4172	4172	Millie	2105	“ His own mom is even worse . ”
4189	4208	4172	4172	Millie	2105	“ Does she still have the shop downtown ? The one that sells all the crystals and candles ? ”
4209	4230	4231	4231	I	441	“ Yep . Mystic on Main . She ’s constantly trying to set him up on dates with her customers . ”
4272	4332	4333	4333	Millie	2105	“ Like she ’ll call him and say she has a computer problem at the shop , or she ca n’t reach something on a high shelf , and when he shows up to help , there is n’t really a problem , but there ’s a woman she wants to introduce him to . He gets so mad . ”
4336	4344	4333	4333	Millie	2105	“ Does he ever talk about Zlatka ? ”
4394	4397	4387	4388	the media	312	“ No . ”
4398	4411	4412	4412	My	441	“ I wonder if it ’s true what she said about him . ”
4416	4428	4429	4429	Millie	2105	“ I have no idea , and I ’m not asking . ”
4432	4466	4429	4429	Millie	2105	“ No , I guess there ’s no way you can be like , ‘ Hey , I heard you like to tie women up and boss them around in the bedroom . ’ ”
4467	4474	4387	4388	the media	312	“ People just like to talk . ”
4475	4481	4482	4482	Millie	2105	“ Especially about that stuff , ”
4485	4525	4526	4526	I	441	“ Although if you see any whips , chains , or blindfolds in his closet , let me know . It seems so opposite his quiet personality , but you never know what people are like behind closed doors . ”
4541	4553	4429	4429	Millie	2105	“ Anyway , what am I going to do about tonight ? ”
4554	4565	4429	4429	Millie	2105	“ Why go at all ? Just do n’t show . ”
4566	4610	4429	4429	Millie	2105	“ Because I ’m catering some appetizers , which I had to beg to do , because the reunion chairwoman wanted to go with one caterer , and she did n’t want everything vegetarian . But I thought it would be good publicity . ”
4611	4620	4429	4429	Millie	2105	“ Maybe you can just drop them off . ”
4621	4633	4634	4634	My	441	“ I do n’t want to be that person , Millie . ”
4642	4679	4634	4634	My	441	“ I do n’t want to be intimidated by people . I want to prove to myself that I can hold my head up in front of Mimi Pepper - Peabody , even with terrible bangs . ”
4680	4685	4686	4686	Millie	2105	“ Okay , okay . ”
4693	4703	4686	4686	Millie	2105	“ Who the heck is Mimi Pepper - Peabody ? ”
4704	4728	4429	4429	Millie	2105	“ She ’s the reunion chair , a girl I went to school with . Beautiful , popular , you know the type . ”
4729	4734	4735	4735	I	441	“ A mean girl ? ”
4738	4828	4735	4735	I	441	“ That ’s tricky . It ’s not like she was outwardly mean to my face , but she had a way of cutting you down without looking like she was doing it . If I got a bloody nose in class , instead of privately asking me if I needed a tissue , she ’d yell out , ‘ Ew ! Felicity ’s nose is gushing buckets of blood , and it ’s so gross ! ’ And everyone would either laugh or say how disgusting it was . ”
4829	4837	4847	4847	I	441	“ Um , that ’s outwardly mean . ”
4838	4846	4847	4847	I	441	“ Yeah , I guess it is . ”
4859	4873	4847	4847	I	441	“ But she was so popular , she could get away with anything . ”
4874	4889	4890	4890	I	441	“ Well , tonight ’s your chance to tell her to go fuck herself . ”
4893	4900	4890	4890	I	441	“ That ’s not my style . ”
4901	4963	4847	4847	I	441	“ Fine . So go show her that being popular in high school does n’t mean shit once high school is over . And you never know , maybe she lost her looks . Maybe karma caught up with her and all her hair fell out from bleaching it too much . Maybe she has ten big warts on her nose . ”
4964	4983	4984	4984	I	441	“ Nope . I see her around town and she looks the same as she did back then . ”
4996	5001	4984	4984	I	441	“ And so do I. ”
5002	5021	5030	5030	I	441	“ Still . She ca n’t make you feel bad about yourself if you do n’t let her . ”
5022	5029	5030	5030	I	441	“ I wo n’t let her , ”
5731	5739	5727	5727	I	441	“ You know I hate the phone . ”
5740	5744	5746	5746	Felicity	148	“ I do , ”
5748	5771	5746	5746	Felicity	148	“ and I ’m sorry . But I did n’t think I could convey the urgency of this matter in a text . ”
5788	5798	5746	5746	Felicity	148	“ Are you okay ? Is your nose bleeding ? ”
5799	5807	5746	5746	Felicity	148	“ No , it ’s not that . ”
5808	5821	5822	5822	I	441	“ Good . The memory of that last one still haunts me . ”
6310	6313	6308	6308	I	441	“ surprisingly great ”
6505	6516	6517	6517	she	352	“ Yeah , that was a bad one , sorry , ”
6520	6551	6552	6552	I	441	“ Hope they got the stains out of the tablecloth . But this does n’t involve blood , I promise . It does n’t even involve talking on the phone ! ”
6565	6571	6552	6552	I	441	“ What does it involve ? ”
6572	6578	6552	6552	I	441	“ Doing me a favor . ”
6579	6584	6552	6552	I	441	“ I ’m listening . ”
6585	6611	6552	6552	I	441	“ Okay , but before I tell you what it is , you have to promise to at least consider what I have to say . ”
6612	6624	6625	6625	I	441	“ You ’re not really nailing this sales pitch , MacAllister . ”
6648	6656	6657	6657	She	352	“ Sorry , let me try again . ”
6662	6671	6672	6672	I	441	“ Hey , Hutton ! How are you ? ”
6675	6685	6672	6672	I	441	“ Okay , considering I ’m on the phone . ”
6686	6696	6552	6552	I	441	“ Did you run in the park this morning ? ”
6697	6700	6672	6672	I	441	“ Yes . ”
6701	6711	6672	6672	I	441	“ Were the Prancin ’ Grannies out and about ? ”
6712	6734	6735	6735	Felicity	148	“ In full force . They just got matching T - shirts , which they were very excited to show me . ”
6738	6745	6735	6735	Felicity	148	“ Oh yeah ? What color ? ”
6746	6769	6672	6672	I	441	“ I ’d call it Pepto Bismol Pink . And they ’re bedazzled — which is a new word I learned today . ”
6770	6796	6735	6735	Felicity	148	“ I ’m sure that addition to your vocabulary will come in handy in your line of work . So what are you up to ? ”
6797	6823	6824	6824	Allie	73	“ I ’m going over to my sister ’s house to watch the kids so she can get a haircut . Neil is working today . ”
6886	6892	6893	6893	Felicity	148	“ That sounds like fun . ”
6896	6906	6893	6893	Felicity	148	“ What about tonight ? Do you have plans ? ”
6907	6910	6911	6911	I	441	“ Why ? ”
6925	6947	6948	6948	she	234	“ Because I ’m going somewhere really fun , and I was thinking maybe you ’d like to go with me ! ”
6954	6966	6948	6948	she	234	“ You ’re not talking about the reunion , are you ? ”
6967	6977	6978	6978	she	234	“ There will be food and drinks and music , ”
6988	7000	6978	6978	she	234	“ lots of people we have n’t seen in ten years — ”
7001	7021	6948	6948	she	234	“ I ’d gladly go another ten without seeing ninety - nine - point - nine percent of them . ”
7022	7031	6948	6948	she	234	“ — and I ’m making zucchini fritters ! ”
7032	7055	6978	6978	she	234	“ Felicity , you already asked me if I ’d go to this thing , and I said sorry , but no . ”
7056	7063	6948	6948	she	234	“ Do n’t you like zucchini ? ”
7064	7112	7113	7113	She	441	“ I like zucchini just fine . But I did n’t like high school that much , I do n’t like social events at all , and the thought of having to make small talk with any of those people makes me want to eat rat poison . ”
7116	7122	7113	7113	She	441	“ Yeah . I know . ”
7123	7132	6978	6978	she	234	“ Also , I have other plans tonight . ”
7133	7139	6948	6948	she	234	“ What are you doing ? ”
7140	7155	7113	7113	She	441	“ I promised my dad I ’d come to his barbershop quartet poker night . ”
7156	7161	7162	7162	she	441	“ That ’s social , ”
7165	7181	7182	7182	I	441	“ It ’s slightly social , and I do n’t really want to do it , ”
7192	7272	7182	7182	I	441	“ But there will only be four old guys there , and we ’ll be occupied with the card game . There will be snacks and beer , but no small talk . Minimal eye contact . No one asking for selfies . No prancing grannies . Possibly I ’ll have to endure some old - timey four - part harmonies , and I ’ll definitely be subjected to a lot of dad jokes , but I ’ll live . ”
7273	7288	7314	7314	Felicity	148	“ I love that your dad is actually a barber in a barbershop quartet . ”
7289	7313	7314	7314	Felicity	148	“ The Clipper Cuts are available for wakes , weddings , and everything in between . They will meet all your entertainment needs . ”
7317	7345	7314	7314	Felicity	148	“ Well , while you ’re enjoying the snacks and harmonies , spare a thought for me trying to survive high school again , this time alone . ”
7346	7353	7354	7354	Avoidance	79	“ Just skip it , Felicity . ”
7359	7364	7365	7365	she	79	“ I ca n’t , ”
7368	7372	7365	7365	she	79	“ Why not ? ”
7373	7400	7401	7401	She	79	“ Because I ’m catering some appetizers and it will be a good business opportunity . Plus , I might have to do some damage control . ”
7421	7436	7412	7412	she	79	“ And it ’s all lies ! That bride raved about everything all night . ”
7437	7449	7450	7450	She	79	“ Want me to buy the app and shut it down ? ”
7453	7492	7450	7450	She	79	“ Oh my God , can you ? No , wait . Do n’t do that — it ’s a really helpful thing for a lot of people and businesses . Just not for me at the moment . ”
7493	7502	7503	7503	I	441	“ Your business is going to be fine , ”
7507	7527	7503	7503	I	441	“ But I know how it feels to have people talking shit about you , and I ’m sorry . ”
7630	7641	7642	7642	she	441	“ Does that mean you ’ll come with me tonight ? ”
7646	7671	7672	7672	She	441	“ No . But if there are any leftover zucchini fritters , bring them over tomorrow . You can tell me how it went . ”
7675	7700	7672	7672	She	441	“ Fine . But if I change my mind about the app , would you really buy it and shut it down for me ? ”
7701	7706	7672	7672	She	441	“ In a heartbeat . ”
7707	7717	7718	7718	We	377	“ Thank you . Have fun with your family . ”
8479	8483	8467	8467	Allie	73	“ What’cha doin’ ? ”
8484	8499	8500	8500	She	73	“ Deciding whether I want to come in . Are Mom and Dad here ? ”
8503	8520	8500	8500	She	73	“ They stopped by after their Saturday morning power walk . Matching track suits and all . ”
8521	8529	8467	8467	Allie	73	“ Any way I can avoid them ? ”
8530	8539	8467	8467	Allie	73	“ Why do you need to avoid them ? ”
8540	8587	8588	8588	She	73	“ They ’re just a lot . Mom ’s all over me about what she calls my emotional avoidance issues , trying to set me up on dates with her kooky clients right and left , and I ’m already hanging out with Dad later tonight . ”
8591	8595	8588	8588	She	73	“ Poker night ? ”
8596	8599	8500	8500	She	73	“ Yeah . ”
8600	8642	8643	8643	She	73	“ Lucky you . But you ca n’t leave . I need to be at the salon in twenty minutes , and Mom and Dad both have to work today . They just popped in to see the kids real quick . ”
8647	8653	8643	8643	She	73	“ They love popping in . ”
8654	8670	8588	8588	She	73	“ I told you not to buy a house right around the block from them . ”
8671	8678	8679	8679	She	73	“ I know , I know . ”
8685	8704	8679	8679	She	73	“ But it ’s a good location and the price was right . We ’re not all billionaires . ”
8705	8723	8724	8724	She	73	“ Fuck off , I told you I ’d help you with a house . You refused . ”
8728	8758	8759	8759	She	73	“ I did , and it gave me great pleasure . So thanks for that . Anyway , you covered my student loans , and that was a lot . ”
8764	8774	8759	8759	She	73	“ You get free therapy from me for life . ”
8775	8795	8588	8588	She	73	“ Just what a guy wants , his big sister bossing him around and calling it good for him . ”
8796	8847	8759	8759	She	73	“ Speaking of which , did you call the woman I told you about , Natalia Lopez ? The one who does the acceptance and commitment therapy ? She ’s always booked super far in advance but as a favor to me , she said she ’d get you in . ”
8848	8857	8759	8759	She	73	“ No . I do n’t call people . ”
8858	8884	8588	8588	She	73	“ Hutton ! You did n’t like cognitive behavioral therapy , and this is another option . A different approach . Why not try it ? ”
8885	8893	8759	8759	She	73	“ Because I do n’t need it . ”
8894	8924	8759	8759	She	73	“ So testifying in front of Congress wo n’t be a problem then ? How many times are they going to let you get away with pushing it back ? ”
9231	9234	9235	9235	he	241	“ Hutton ! ”
9242	9247	9235	9235	he	241	“ Still coming tonight ? ”
9248	9255	9215	9215	she	417	“ Do I have a choice ? ”
9256	9269	9270	9270	He	241	“ Nope , I already told the guys you ’ll be there . ”
9273	9294	9270	9270	He	241	“ They ’re excited to have a celebrity at the game , but a little worried about your deep pockets . ”
9295	9304	9305	9305	I	441	“ I ’m not a celebrity , Dad , ”
9317	9332	9334	9335	my sister	234	“ They should be worried about him counting cards , not placing high bets , ”
9345	9356	9334	9335	my sister	234	“ Hutton has never cheated a day in his life ! ”
9368	9391	9334	9335	my sister	234	“ And he knows that nothing good ever comes from taking a penny you did n’t earn . It brings bad luck . ”
9489	9503	9505	9505	Zosia	412	“ But what if you find a penny on the street , Grandma ? ”
9507	9514	9505	9505	Zosia	412	“ Is n’t that good luck ? ”
9515	9527	9528	9528	she	234	“ Depends if you find it tails or heads side up , ”
9532	9569	9570	9571	My sister	234	“ The ancient Romans believed if you saw a coin heads up , it was lucky , but if it was tails up , you should turn it over and leave it for the next person . ”
9574	9615	9570	9571	My sister	234	“ I ’ll keep that in mind in case I come across any ancient Roman coins . In the meantime , I ’m gon na predict that being a math genius gives Hutton the edge at the poker table tonight . ”
9616	9645	9646	9646	I	441	“ The only edge being a math genius might give someone at the poker table is knowing they should quit early and go home with all their money , ”
9655	9673	9646	9646	I	441	“ The reason casinos are so huge is because most people have no idea how probability works . ”
9674	9677	9678	9679	My mother	412	“ Hutton . ”
9701	9706	9699	9699	hers	412	“ Are you okay ? ”
9707	9712	9699	9699	hers	412	“ I ’m fine . ”
9713	9720	9699	9699	hers	412	“ You do n’t look fine . ”
9721	9728	9699	9699	hers	412	“ I ’m fine , Mom . ”
9729	9743	9744	9745	My dad	411	“ Look at him , Stan . Does he look fine to you ? ”
9748	9753	9744	9745	My dad	411	“ I suppose so . ”
9754	9770	9699	9699	hers	412	“ You do n’t think he looks sort of pale and sad around the eyes ? ”
9771	9777	9778	9779	My father	411	“ Sad around the eyes ? ”
9784	9789	9778	9779	My father	411	“ Maybe a little . ”
9790	9804	9805	9805	Allie	73	“ I ’m getting a sense of loneliness and discontent within your aura . ”
9816	9820	9821	9821	I	441	“ Stop it , ”
9824	9830	9821	9821	I	441	“ My aura is fine . ”
9831	9843	9844	9845	My mom	412	“ You do n’t have to pretend with us , sweetheart . ”
9850	9856	9844	9845	My mom	412	“ We ’re your family . ”
9857	9863	9821	9821	I	441	“ I ’m not pre — ”
9864	9874	9875	9875	she	412	“ Money ca n’t buy happiness , you know , ”
9879	9909	9875	9875	she	412	“ True happiness comes from our connection to others and to our higher selves . It does n’t come from things like yachts or private jets or fancy cars . ”
9910	9922	9924	9924	she	412	“ I do n’t own any of those things , Mom . ”
9930	9952	9924	9924	she	412	“ It comes from allowing yourself to be loved and offering love in return . Is n’t that right , Stan ? ”
9953	9960	9961	9962	My dad	241	“ That ’s right , Barb . ”
9972	9989	9990	9990	Her	412	“ And you do n’t need to be rich or famous or brilliant to find love . ”
9995	10011	9990	9990	Her	412	“ You just have to accept yourself as you are , and open your heart . ”
10012	10028	10030	10030	Allie	73	“ Actually , I think being rich , famous , and brilliant makes it harder , ”
10032	10054	10030	10030	Allie	73	“ You ’d get a lot of people wanting to be close to you , but maybe for the wrong reasons . ”
10055	10066	10067	10068	my mom	412	“ I ’m not saying it ’s easy to find , ”
10071	10089	10030	10030	Allie	73	“ I ’m just saying that we ’re all worthy . Do n’t you agree , Hutton ? ”
10090	10093	10094	10094	I	441	“ Yes , ”
10532	10538	10539	10539	I	441	“ Come on , guys , ”
10542	10562	10539	10539	I	441	“ Your faces are getting red , and your mom is going to get mad at me about it . ”
10687	10695	10678	10678	Allie	73	“ Wow . Look at you guys . ”
10696	10714	10715	10715	She	73	“ I said I ’d watch them . I did n’t say I ’d keep them clean . ”
10727	10735	10736	10736	I	441	“ Do you like the new cut ? ”
10741	10748	10749	10749	She	73	“ Looks the same to me . ”
10755	10784	10749	10749	She	73	“ Hey , someone in the chair next to me at the salon mentioned she was going to her ten - year reunion tonight . Is it yours ? ”
10785	10788	10749	10749	She	73	“ Probably . ”
10789	10795	10749	10749	She	73	“ You ’re not going ? ”
10796	10799	10749	10749	She	73	“ No . ”
10800	10804	10805	10805	I	441	“ Why not ? ”
10815	10821	10805	10805	I	441	“ I already have plans . ”
10822	10832	10749	10749	She	73	“ Poker night ? Those are your big plans ? ”
10833	10849	10850	10850	She	73	“ I did n’t say they were big . I just said they were plans . ”
10872	10877	10865	10865	she	73	“ Is Felicity going ? ”
10878	10883	10859	10859	she	73	“ I think so . ”
10901	10915	10898	10898	I	441	“ She asked me to go with her , but I said no . ”
10931	10955	10924	10924	she	234	“ Hutton ! How could you say no ? She was your best friend in high school . She was your prom date . ”
10956	10960	10961	10961	She	234	“ I remember . ”
10969	10982	10961	10961	She	234	“ And do you remember what you went through before asking her ? ”
10988	11020	10961	10961	She	234	“ Because I do . You agonized over it for weeks . It got so bad , you came to me for advice . I had to talk you into it . ”
11021	11038	10961	10961	She	234	“ Because it was scary . I did n’t know what she was going to say . ”
11039	11052	10961	10961	She	234	“ But she said yes , and you had a good time . ”
11299	11310	11311	11311	I	441	“ Look , it ’s nothing to do with Felicity , ”
11315	11323	11311	11311	I	441	“ I always have fun with her . ”
11324	11330	11331	11331	She	73	“ Of course you do . ”
11336	11387	11331	11331	She	73	“ We all know how you feel about Felicity , Hutton . It ’s been obvious for years . And despite your messy hair and your ugly mug and your terrible personality , she genuinely likes you too . I do n’t get why you two are n’t a thing . ”
11550	11557	11558	11558	I	441	“ I need a fairy godmother , ”
11592	11599	11586	11586	Luna	95	“ How about three of them ? ”
11600	11604	11567	11567	She	58	“ Even better . ”
11605	11619	11620	11620	she	58	“ Dex is out running errands , so we ’re having girl time , ”
11629	11634	11620	11620	she	58	“ Come on upstairs ! ”
11650	11656	11639	11639	I	441	“ How about this one ? ”
11678	11681	11683	11683	Hallie	96	“ Yes , ”
11695	11704	11690	11690	she	95	“ It ’s definitely the best so far . ”
11705	11710	11711	11714	Golden - headed Luna	95	“ I like it . ”
11719	11726	11711	11714	Golden - headed Luna	95	“ Blue is my favorite color . ”
11727	11736	11737	11737	Winnie	58	“ It is a great shade for you . ”
11759	11769	11711	11714	Golden - headed Luna	95	“ There . Now it fits a little better . ”
11770	11773	11774	11774	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
11865	11887	11939	11939	Hallie	96	“ I do like the color . You do n’t think the top is too . . . baggy on me ? ”
11888	11891	11892	11892	Winnie	58	“ Hmm . ”
11898	11908	11892	11892	Winnie	58	“ Do you have a push - up bra ? ”
11909	11918	11920	11920	Luna	95	“ What ’s a push - up bra ? ”
11922	11937	11939	11939	Hallie	96	“ It ’s a bra that pushes up your boobies and squeezes them together , ”
11941	11956	11957	11957	I	441	“ So they sort of bulge out like water balloons . Mom wears them . ”
11960	11968	11957	11957	I	441	“ I might have something at home . ”
11969	11978	11979	11979	Winnie	58	“ Good . Okay , now the shoes . ”
11994	12024	11979	11979	Winnie	58	“ I think the nude strappy ones will be the best , but the platform sandals could also be cute . How much standing do you have to do ? ”
12025	12031	12032	12032	I	441	“ I do n’t know , ”
12052	12072	12046	12046	they	463	“ But I do n’t want to have trouble walking , and I ’m definitely not used to heels . ”
12073	12078	12079	12079	Winnie	58	“ I like those , ”
12098	12114	12115	12115	I	441	“ But it ’s not a very dressy look . How fancy is this event ? ”
12118	12125	12115	12115	I	441	“ The invitation said dressy casual . ”
12126	12133	12134	12134	Hallie	96	“ That ’s two different things , ”
12146	12163	12138	12138	I	441	“ Exactly . Why do fashionable people make things more difficult than they need to be ? ”
12164	12173	12174	12174	Winnie	58	“ I think this look works for casual , ”
12178	12194	12174	12174	Winnie	58	“ but if you want to go a little dressier , maybe try the heels . ”
12195	12204	12205	12205	I	441	“ I want to look elegant and sophisticated , ”
12212	12219	12208	12209	My sister	234	“ Then go for the heels . ”
12240	12243	12208	12209	My sister	234	“ Well ? ”
12244	12249	12250	12250	Winnie	58	“ They look perfect , ”
12253	12263	12264	12264	I	441	“ But can you get around in them okay ? ”
12272	12277	12264	12264	I	441	“ I ’ll manage . ”
12278	12281	12282	12282	She	95	“ Good . ”
12292	12304	12305	12305	My	441	“ Now what are we going to do about that hair ? ”
12310	12323	12305	12305	My	441	“ I do n’t know . I should n’t have cut it . ”
12324	12328	12330	12330	Winnie	58	“ I agree , ”
12332	12359	12360	12360	I	441	“ but that ship has sailed , so let ’s figure out what we can do . Take it down and we ’ll look at it . ”
12365	12371	12360	12360	I	441	“ It ’s not pretty . ”
12372	12385	12360	12360	I	441	“ I ’ve seen your self - serve haircuts before , sis . ”
12386	12395	12397	12397	I	441	“ This might be one of the worst . ”
12443	12453	12454	12454	Luna	95	“ Why did you do that to your hair ? ”
12457	12464	12465	12465	I	441	“ It ’s hard to explain , ”
12479	12516	12517	12517	I	441	“ Sometimes I just have this urge to cut it and I ca n’t stop myself . Like when I ’m upset about something . And I think cutting my hair will make me feel better . ”
12537	12550	12526	12526	I	441	“ But it does n’t . It only makes me feel worse . ”
12551	12557	12559	12559	Luna	95	“ I have an idea , ”
12561	12565	12566	12566	She	95	“ You do ? ”
12570	12574	12566	12566	She	95	“ Space buns . ”
12575	12579	12566	12566	She	95	“ Space buns ? ”
12580	12583	12584	12584	Hallie	96	“ Yes ! ”
12588	12609	12610	12610	Winnie	58	“ That ’s a great idea ! Space buns would n’t show how it ’s all crazy at the ends . ”
12613	12634	12610	12610	Winnie	58	“ You know what ? She might be right . Unless you have time to go get a professional trim . ”
12635	12640	12641	12641	I	441	“ I do n’t , ”
12644	12704	12641	12641	I	441	“ I barely had time to come here . I have to get my fritters and crostini in the Cloverleigh ovens before the restaurant there opens at five , pack everything in the warming bags , load the car , haul it over to the banquet hall by six , then have everything set out by quarter to seven . ”
12705	12712	12714	12715	my sister	234	“ Space buns for the win , ”
12717	12736	12714	12715	my sister	234	“ Hals and Loony , can you grab me a comb , two elastics , and some pins ? ”
12737	12740	12741	12742	Both girls	469	“ Yes ! ”
12753	12762	12763	12763	I	441	“ Can you make space buns look elegant ? ”
12778	12785	12786	12786	Her	234	“ I ’ll do my best . ”
12850	12856	12857	12857	I	441	“ Thank you so much , ”
12860	12869	12870	12870	Winnie	58	“ Want me to do your makeup too ? ”
12873	12877	12870	12870	Winnie	58	“ Would you ? ”
12878	12889	12890	12890	Hallie	96	“ Of course ! What else are fairy godmothers for ? ”
12931	12939	12940	12940	I	441	“ Well ? What do you think ? ”
12951	12965	12945	12945	Luna	95	“ I think you ’ll be the most beautiful lady at the party . ”
12966	12970	12971	12971	Hallie	96	“ Me too , ”
12974	12977	12978	12978	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
12984	12997	12978	12978	I	441	“ I do n’t know what I ’d have done without you . ”
12998	13002	13003	13003	Winnie	58	“ Me neither , ”
13009	13015	13003	13003	Winnie	58	“ You better get going . ”
13064	13067	13047	13047	They	466	“ Dad ! ”
13079	13084	13068	13068	Luna	95	“ Look at Felicity ! ”
13085	13090	13091	13091	he	59	“ Hey , Felicity , ”
13094	13099	13100	13100	Luna	95	“ Hi , Dex . ”
13105	13119	13120	13120	Dex	59	“ Does n’t she look pretty ? She ’s going to a party . ”
13126	13130	13120	13120	Dex	59	“ Very pretty . ”
13131	13140	13141	13141	Hallie	96	“ But that ’s not the complete outfit , ”
13147	13177	13141	13141	Hallie	96	“ She ’s not going to wear those shoes , and she definitely needs a push - up bra for the dress , but we helped do her hair . ”
13196	13204	13184	13184	Winnie	58	“ Bye , Felicity . Have fun . ”
13205	13210	13211	13211	I	441	“ I ’ll try , ”
13222	13227	13211	13211	I	441	“ Just be yourself ! ”
13438	13446	13447	13447	I	441	“ It ’s going to be fine , ”
13455	13483	13447	13447	I	441	“ You have come a long way , even if you do n’t feel it . And there ’s nothing wrong with being a work in progress . ”
13714	13718	13719	13719	she	481	“ Hi there , ”
13733	13748	13719	13719	she	481	“ I ’m Mimi Pepper - Peabody , soon to be Mimi Van Pelt . ”
13767	13773	13749	13749	She	481	“ I ’m getting married . ”
13774	13777	13778	13778	I	441	“ Congratulations , ”
13781	13785	13778	13778	I	441	“ Thank you . ”
13794	13799	13778	13778	I	441	“ And you are ? ”
13800	13806	13807	13807	I	441	“ I ’m Felicity MacAllister , ”
13819	13832	13807	13807	I	441	“ We spoke on the phone ? I ’m the Veggie Vixen . ”
13845	13883	13833	13833	Mimi	412	“ I ’m so sorry , I thought you were one of the students I hired to help set up . You look so young with your hair in those things — what do you call them ? ”
13884	13888	13889	13889	I	441	“ Space buns , ”
13900	13924	13929	13929	she	412	“ Space buns , yes . My little cousin likes to wear her hair like that . Of course , she ’s eight . ”
13934	13946	13929	13929	she	412	“ But do n’t worry , it ’s cute for you . ”
13970	13973	13965	13965	My	441	“ Thanks . ”
13974	13995	13996	13996	I	441	“ But you should tell your stylist not to cut your bangs so short . They look a little silly . ”
14007	14033	14002	14002	Mimi	412	“ I remember you now — you used to get those awful bloody noses in the middle of class ! Do you still get them ? ”
14034	14037	14038	14038	She	412	“ Sometimes . ”
14041	14052	14038	14038	She	412	“ How embarrassing . Hope that does n’t happen tonight . ”
14053	14062	14063	14063	I	441	“ Would you like to try an appetizer ? ”
14080	14093	14038	14038	She	412	“ No , thanks . So you ’re in food service now ? ”
14094	14104	14105	14105	I	441	“ Catering , yes . And a food blogger . ”
14115	14120	14121	14121	She	412	“ How about you ? ”
14126	14142	14121	14121	She	412	“ I ’m a lifestyle blogger and influencer . How many followers do you have ? ”
14143	14150	14151	14151	Her	412	“ I just hit two thousand . ”
14156	14174	14151	14151	Her	412	“ I have three thousand , four - hundred - eighteen . I ’m growing really fast . ”
14175	14184	14121	14121	She	412	“ Oh . . . that ’s cool . ”
14185	14213	14214	14214	She	412	“ Let me know if you need any tips on building a following . Good to see you , Felicity — you have n’t changed a bit . ”
14311	14317	14318	14318	I	441	“ Make it a double , ”
14323	14330	14318	14318	I	441	“ And easy on the soda . ”
14331	14340	14341	14341	He	488	“ You ’re twenty - one , right ? ”
14354	14361	14362	14362	I	441	“ I ’m twenty - eight , ”
14365	14374	14362	14362	I	441	“ Do you want to see my ID ? ”
14375	14379	14380	14380	He	488	“ All good . ”
14391	14395	14380	14380	He	488	“ Just checking . ”
14485	14490	14492	14492	Carrie	105	“ Mmm , crostini , ”
14511	14517	14494	14494	She	105	“ What ’s on this ? ”
14518	14534	14535	14535	I	441	“ Goat cheese , dates , walnuts , fresh thyme , and a little honey , ”
14547	14560	14539	14539	she	105	“ And those over there are watermelon , basil , and feta . ”
14561	14564	14566	14566	Ella	234	“ Oooh , ”
14592	14607	14579	14579	They	489	“ I ’ll try that watermelon one for sure . And what are those ? ”
14608	14623	14624	14624	I	441	“ Zucchini fritters . Everything is vegetarian , and all the produce is local , ”
14629	14635	14637	14637	Carrie	105	“ This is so good , ”
14650	14658	14637	14637	Carrie	105	“ Mimi , you should try this . ”
14659	14668	14669	14669	Mimi	412	“ I do n’t eat bread or dairy . ”
14689	14696	14681	14681	She	412	“ The bloat , you know ? ”
14697	14702	14703	14703	Ella	234	“ Live a little . ”
14706	14716	14703	14703	Ella	234	“ One crostini is n’t going to bloat you . ”
14774	14781	14765	14765	Her	412	“ Wow . That is good . ”
14792	14800	14782	14782	She	412	“ How many calories are in them ? ”
14801	14808	14809	14809	I	441	“ I ’m not sure exactly , ”
14812	14835	14809	14809	I	441	“ But the bread is sliced very thin , and compared to other cheeses , feta is very low in calories and — ”
14836	14842	14843	14843	Mimi	412	“ Maybe just one more . ”
14858	14865	14855	14855	Carrie	105	“ Told you they were delicious . ”
14866	14872	14873	14873	Mimi	412	“ They ’re pretty good , ”
14905	14922	14898	14898	Mimi	412	“ The Veggie Vixen . But there ’s nothing very vixenish about you , is there ? ”
14946	14958	14959	14959	Ella	234	“ Do you cater weddings , Felicity ? Mimi is engaged , ”
14963	14967	14968	14968	I	441	“ I heard . ”
14975	15002	14968	14968	I	441	“ And yes , I do . And I ’d love to talk about your wedding . I have plenty of dishes without gluten or dairy . ”
15012	15025	15026	15026	she	234	“ Oh , Thornton would probably revolt if I planned anything vegetarian , ”
15033	15061	15026	15026	she	234	“ He ’s such a man ’s man . You know how those millionaires are , with their hunting cabins and big game safaris . Such carnivores . ”
15078	15106	15107	15107	Mimi	412	“ But maybe some cute little things for one of my showers . I ’m using Dearly Beloved to plan everything . Are you on that app ? ”
15128	15138	15120	15120	she	412	“ I ’ll make sure I ’m following you . ”
15139	15143	15144	15144	I	441	“ Following me ? ”
15147	15154	15155	15155	She	412	“ Yes . On Dearly Beloved . ”
15161	15165	15155	15155	She	412	“ Keep up . ”
15191	15197	15198	15198	I	441	“ I ’m engaged too , ”
15215	15219	15201	15201	Mimi	412	“ Are you ? ”
15220	15223	15201	15201	Mimi	412	“ Yes . ”
15224	15228	15201	15201	Mimi	412	“ To who ? ”
15229	15235	15236	15236	Mimi	412	“ To a hot billionaire . ”
15241	15250	15236	15236	Mimi	412	“ You ’re engaged to a hot billionaire ? ”
15251	15254	15201	15201	Mimi	412	“ Yes . ”
15255	15258	15201	15201	Mimi	412	“ Who ? ”
15259	15263	15236	15236	Mimi	412	“ Hutton French . ”
15275	15279	15280	15281	The trio	498	“ Hutton French ? ”
15292	15304	15305	15305	Carrie	105	“ The one from our graduating class who was dating Zlatka ? ”
15308	15313	15314	15314	I	441	“ They broke up , ”
15318	15325	15314	15314	I	441	“ So where ’s your ring ? ”
15341	15354	15337	15337	I	441	“ It ’s being sized . It ’s at the jeweler ’s . ”
15355	15370	15372	15372	Ella	234	“ Hard to believe that guy from high school is now a famous billionaire , ”
15374	15381	15383	15383	she	234	“ He was so . . . ”
15397	15400	15401	15401	she	234	“ Quiet , ”
15404	15408	15401	15401	she	234	“ And shy . ”
15409	15413	15414	15414	I	441	“ But smart , ”
15417	15422	15414	15414	I	441	“ He ’s brilliant . ”
15423	15427	15428	15428	Ella	234	“ And gorgeous . ”
15436	15464	15428	15428	Ella	234	“ Like , I see his photos now , and I ’m like , damn , why did n’t you look this good back in high school ? ”
15465	15469	15470	15470	I	441	“ He did , ”
15488	15497	15499	15499	Carrie	105	“ I heard he was back in town , ”
15501	15510	15499	15499	Carrie	105	“ My nana saw him at the park . ”
15511	15518	15519	15519	Mimi	412	“ So where is he now ? ”
15525	15532	15533	15533	I	441	“ Why is n’t he here ? ”
15538	15546	15533	15533	I	441	“ He ’s very busy with work . ”
15547	15554	15555	15555	Ella	234	“ What exactly does he do ? ”
15558	15583	15555	15555	Ella	234	“ I ’ve read the articles about him and all , but I ’m embarrassed to say I have no idea what cryptocurrency is . ”
15584	15589	15590	15590	I	441	“ It ’s complicated . ”
15605	15617	15618	15618	Mimi	412	“ It ’s too bad he could n’t be here tonight , ”
15628	15644	15618	15618	Mimi	412	“ You ’d think he ’d want to support your little business venture and all . ”
15645	15651	15652	15652	I	441	“ He ’s very supportive , ”
15666	15672	15663	15663	I	441	“ He ’s coming later . ”
15683	15698	15676	15676	she	412	“ How nice . I ca n’t wait to congratulate you both in person . ”
15709	15736	15704	15704	I	441	“ If you ’ll excuse me , I ’ll just go call him and see if he ’s on his way . Nice chatting with you . ”
16241	16244	16235	16235	He	148	“ What ? ”
16260	16267	16235	16235	He	148	“ I did n’t say anything . ”
16268	16275	16235	16235	He	148	“ You were staring at me . ”
16276	16292	16235	16235	He	148	“ No , I was n’t . I was staring into space . And thinking . ”
16293	16297	16235	16235	He	148	“ About what ? ”
16298	16305	16306	16306	My	441	“ Have you ever kissed anyone ? ”
16323	16326	16315	16315	he	148	“ No . ”
16327	16331	16332	16332	I	441	“ Me neither . ”
16344	16351	16352	16352	He	148	“ Have you ever wanted to ? ”
16357	16362	16352	16352	He	148	“ Wanted to what ? ”
16363	16367	16368	16368	He	148	“ Kiss someone . ”
16379	16383	16373	16373	His	148	“ Have you ? ”
16384	16387	16388	16388	I	441	“ Yes , ”
16393	16397	16391	16391	Bob	108	“ Me too . ”
16636	16644	16627	16627	I	441	“ My mother did n’t want me . ”
16651	16654	16645	16645	Hutton	148	“ Huh ? ”
16655	16667	16645	16645	Hutton	148	“ My mother did n’t want me . My real mom . ”
16668	16674	16675	16675	I	441	“ The one that left ? ”
16685	16691	16675	16675	I	441	“ How do you know ? ”
16692	16706	16707	16707	He	148	“ I heard her say it one night when I was about six . ”
16719	16722	16707	16707	He	148	“ Fuck . ”
16723	16737	16675	16675	I	441	“ She left about three weeks later . And she never came back . ”
16762	16770	16755	16755	His	148	“ God , what am I doing ? ”
16784	16798	16771	16771	I	441	“ I ’m sorry . Forget what I said . I ’m sorry . ”
16806	16819	16771	16771	I	441	“ I have no idea why I just dumped that on you . ”
16820	16825	16771	16771	I	441	“ It ’s okay . ”
16899	16904	16894	16894	I	441	“ What ’s this ? ”
16905	16909	16910	16910	I	441	“ Open it . ”
16928	16939	16894	16894	I	441	“ You wrote me a note I have to decode ? ”
16940	16945	16894	16894	I	441	“ You remember how ? ”
16946	16951	16894	16894	I	441	“ I think so . ”
16981	16992	16993	16993	I	441	“ I have been and always shall be your friend , ”
17008	17015	16993	16993	I	441	“ It ’s from Star Trek . ”
17016	17020	17021	17021	I	441	“ I know , ”
17033	17042	17028	17028	I	441	“ Thank you . That means a lot . ”
17050	17054	17043	17043	I	441	“ You okay ? ”
17055	17096	17097	17097	I	441	“ Yeah . I think — I think graduation is messing with me . And maybe the fact that we ’re going separate ways in the fall . You ’ve sort of been the best friend I ’ve ever had . ”
17104	17114	17097	17097	I	441	“ What am I going to do without you ? ”
17115	17132	17043	17043	I	441	“ No matter where I am , I ’ll always be there when you need me . ”
17133	17144	17145	17145	I	441	“ I ’ll use the code like a bat signal , ”
17148	17158	17159	17159	He	517	“ Then you ’ll know it ’s really me . ”
17162	17169	17159	17159	He	517	“ I ’ll do the same . ”
17170	17206	17043	17043	I	441	“ And let ’s make a deal — we ca n’t ignore the code , okay ? If one of us uses it to reach out , we drop everything and come to the rescue . ”
17207	17210	17252	17252	she	519	“ Deal . ”
17327	17331	17332	17332	I	441	“ Hey Dad , ”
17335	17343	17332	17332	I	441	“ Are we starting right this second ? ”
17344	17347	17348	17348	he	520	“ Nope , ”
17358	17365	17348	17348	he	520	“ Harvey ’s not here yet . ”
17366	17372	17374	17375	my mom	412	“ Harvey ’s always late , ”
17392	17410	17411	17411	I	441	“ He moves so slowly , I ’m convinced he was a sloth in his last life . ”
17431	17437	17438	17438	she	412	“ Speaking of past lives , ”
17442	17458	17438	17438	she	412	“ I did a reading for the most beautiful woman this afternoon at the store . ”
17459	17467	17468	17468	Women	1423	“ Did she think she was Cleopatra ? ”
17475	17529	17468	17468	Women	1423	“ Yes , but she was n’t . I ’ve met the woman who was Cleopatra , and she lives in Tucson . But she was remarkably lovely , and I think she was latching onto Cleopatra because she ’s lonely and looking for love . I invited her to stop by tonight . ”
17539	17544	17468	17468	Women	1423	“ You did n’t . ”
17545	17555	17468	17468	Women	1423	“ She ’s slightly older than you , but — ”
17556	17560	17468	17468	Women	1423	“ How old ? ”
17561	17571	17468	17468	Women	1423	“ Forty , but she ’s a young forty . ”
17589	17599	17576	17577	my mother	412	“ What are you looking for in that drawer ? ”
17600	17609	17610	17610	I	441	“ Something to write with — found it . ”
17624	17633	17634	17634	She	412	“ I need a piece of paper too . ”
17648	17651	17634	17634	She	412	“ Here . ”
17714	17717	17718	17718	I	441	“ Shit , ”
17721	17726	17718	17718	I	441	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
17765	17774	17748	17748	I	441	“ I have to make a phone call . ”
17835	17838	17824	17824	I	441	“ Hello ? ”
17839	17850	17824	17824	I	441	“ I got the bat signal . What ’s up ? ”
17851	17867	17824	17824	I	441	“ Okay , before I tell you , will you promise to honor the deal ? ”
17868	17879	17824	17824	I	441	“ Why do I have a bad feeling about this ? ”
17880	17885	17824	17824	I	441	“ Do you promise ? ”
17886	17889	17890	17890	She	412	“ Yes . ”
17895	17921	17890	17890	She	412	“ Thank God . Because I have to get out of this closet soon , and I ca n’t face Mimi again without your help . ”
17922	17930	17824	17824	I	441	“ What closet ? Where are you ? ”
17931	17938	17939	17939	she	412	“ I ’m at the reunion , ”
17942	17968	17939	17939	she	412	“ but I ’m hiding in the coat closet because I did something bad . I mean , I said something I should n’t have . ”
17969	17973	17824	17824	I	441	“ About what ? ”
17974	17983	17890	17890	She	412	“ About you . Well , about us . ”
17984	17990	17991	17991	She	412	“ What did you say ? ”
17994	18002	17890	17890	She	412	“ I said that we ’re engaged . ”
18003	18008	17824	17824	I	441	“ You said what ? ”
18009	18050	18051	18051	She	412	“ I said that we were engaged . Well , I said that I was engaged to a hot billionaire , and then when Mimi asked who , I said you . You ’re the only hot billionaire I know . ”
18070	18086	17890	17890	She	412	“ Thanks . But why did you lie about being engaged in the first place ? ”
18087	18096	18097	18097	she	412	“ I could n’t help it , Hutton , ”
18100	18203	18204	18204	she	530	“ Mimi ’s been so mean and terrible all night , first when it was just the two of us , and then in front of her friends , and I just could n’t let her get away with it anymore . She kept bragging about her own engagement to some rich dude who hates vegetables , and making me feel bad about myself , and then she was going to look me up on Dearly Beloved , and I had to say something to stop her before she saw that awful review . So I said I was engaged to you , ”
18212	18223	18204	18204	she	530	“ Also , there may have been some vodka involved . ”
18224	18230	18204	18204	she	530	“ I ’m not surprised . ”
18231	18241	18204	18204	she	530	“ I ’m sorry , Hutton . I panicked . ”
18242	18247	18248	18248	I	441	“ It ’s okay , ”
18252	18263	18248	18248	I	441	“ Do you need me to come pick you up ? ”
18264	18279	18280	18280	My	441	“ No , I need you to come here and be my fake fiancé . ”
18284	18301	18280	18280	My	441	“ Is that really necessary ? Ca n’t you just say I ’m out of town ? ”
18302	18320	18321	18321	I	441	“ It ’s sort of too late for that . I already told her you were coming . ”
18334	18366	18321	18321	I	441	“ I ’m sorry , okay ? I ’ll straighten it all out eventually , but can you please , please come here tonight and pretend like we ’re getting married ? ”
18405	18433	18400	18400	I	441	“ It ’s quarter to eight . I wo n’t be there for at least forty - five minutes . I have to go home and change . ”
18434	18439	18321	18321	I	441	“ That ’s fine . ”
18440	18448	18400	18400	I	441	“ What am I supposed to wear ? ”
18449	18474	18475	18475	I	441	“ Something billionairy . A nice suit and tie . You do n’t happen to have a diamond ring lying around , do you ? ”
18478	18487	18400	18400	I	441	“ I ’m not that kind of billionaire . ”
18488	18498	18400	18400	I	441	“ Is there any chance you could find one ? ”
18499	18515	18400	18400	I	441	“ Where the hell would I find a diamond ring at eight o’clock at night ? ”
18516	18538	18400	18400	I	441	“ I do n’t know . Ca n’t you borrow jewels for the night like Richard Gere did in Pretty Woman ? ”
18539	18554	18555	18555	She	441	“ Richard Gere had more notice than I did . Jewelry stores are closed . ”
18558	18577	18555	18555	She	441	“ It ’s probably fine . I told Mimi the ring was at the jeweler ’s being sized . ”
18578	18595	18596	18596	I	441	“ Jesus Christ , Felicity . How am I going to keep all the lies straight ? ”
18602	18654	18596	18596	I	441	“ Those are the only ones I told so far ! We ’re engaged , the ring is at the jeweler ’s , and you ’re coming here later . I swear to God , I will make it up to you , Hutton — I just need this one night . ”
18655	18659	18660	18660	I	441	“ One hour , ”
18663	18670	18671	18671	she	441	“ One hour will be perfect , ”
18674	18712	18671	18671	she	441	“ I ’ll send you the venue address , and then you can text me when you get here . I ’ll even come out and meet you so you do n’t have to walk in alone . ”
18713	18716	18596	18596	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
18717	18736	18737	18737	I	441	“ Thank you , Hutton . I mean it . You ’re the best friend in the world . ”
18772	18776	18777	18777	she	441	“ Everything okay ? ”
18780	18789	18777	18777	she	441	“ Yeah , but I have to go . ”
18790	18793	18794	18794	I	441	“ Where ? ”
18799	18805	18794	18794	I	441	“ My high school reunion . ”
18806	18809	18810	18810	She	441	“ Really ? ”
18814	18832	18833	18833	I	441	“ Yeah . Felicity is there , and she needs me to . . . show up , ”
18847	18859	18840	18840	I	441	“ A date with Felicity ? I think that ’s wonderful ! ”
18868	18877	18840	18840	I	441	“ Can you apologize to Dad for me ? ”
18878	18901	18840	18840	I	441	“ Of course . Maybe I ’ll introduce Cleopatra to Harvey . He ’s been so lonely since Edna died last year . ”
18902	18906	18907	18907	She	441	“ Good idea . ”
18921	18946	18947	18947	She	441	“ You just go , darling . I ca n’t wait to hear all about it . But are you going to change first ? ”
18960	18970	18971	18971	She	441	“ And maybe fix your hair a little too ? ”
18987	18998	18981	18981	I	441	“ Stop it , Mom . I have to go . ”
18999	19005	19006	19006	She	441	“ Only trying to help . ”
19009	19036	19006	19006	She	441	“ Say hello to Felicity . I always had a feeling about the two of you . Past life soul mates if I ever saw them . ”
19037	19043	18981	18981	I	441	“ We ’re just friends . ”
19059	19103	19051	19051	I	441	“ Do n’t fight it , darling . Tomorrow we should do a tarot reading for you , feel out where this might be heading . And take an umbrella ! The leaves are upside down , and that always means a storm . ”
19375	19378	19373	19373	I	441	“ Hutton ! ”
19400	19412	19386	19386	her	441	“ Thank you so much for coming ! You look amazing . ”
19513	19520	19521	19521	She	441	“ I ’m sorry , Hutton . ”
19532	19544	19521	19521	She	441	“ Forget this . You do n’t have to come in . ”
19634	19649	19650	19650	I	441	“ Are you saying you do n’t want to be engaged to me anymore ? ”
19653	19677	19650	19650	I	441	“ No . I ’m saying that I realize how ridiculous this whole thing is . And it ’s not fair to you . ”
19678	19692	19697	19697	Her	352	“ It ’s really fucking ridiculous . But let ’s do it anyway . ”
19693	19696	19697	19697	Her	352	“ Really ? ”
19704	19718	19697	19697	Her	352	“ Yeah . As long as I do n’t have to talk much . ”
19719	19727	19728	19728	she	352	“ I ’ll do all the talking , ”
19740	19743	19728	19728	she	352	“ Promise . ”
19744	19751	19752	19752	I	441	“ Then it ’s a deal . ”
19831	19845	19824	19824	I	441	“ You made me wear a suit and you ’ve got sneakers on ? ”
19846	19856	19824	19824	I	441	“ That was n’t the plan , but yes . ”
19857	19866	19867	19867	I	441	“ It ’s okay . You look beautiful . ”
19885	19889	19874	19874	She	352	“ I do ? ”
19908	19941	19903	19903	My	441	“ Yes . But it ’s not that I do n’t think you look beautiful other times . I always think you ’re beautiful . I just meant that right now you — ”
19942	19945	19946	19946	She	352	“ Hey . ”
19960	19981	19946	19946	She	352	“ It ’s okay . It was a nice compliment . You ’ve just never said that to me before . ”
19982	19985	19986	19986	I	441	“ Oh . ”
19991	19998	19999	19999	Her	352	“ Well , I meant it . ”
20005	20009	19999	19999	Her	352	“ Thank you . ”
20154	20157	20149	20149	she	352	“ Drink ? ”
20158	20161	20162	20162	I	441	“ Yeah . ”
20172	20196	20162	20162	I	441	“ Stop fussing . You look perfect . I love that navy suit on you . And your blue tie matches your eyes . ”
20197	20200	20149	20149	she	352	“ Thanks . ”
20201	20214	20215	20215	She	352	“ But you just made it crooked . Let me fix it . ”
20239	20245	20162	20162	I	441	“ How ’s that feel ? ”
20246	20249	20250	20250	Our	552	“ Good . ”
20261	20265	20266	20267	the bartender	488	“ Next up , ”
20274	20281	20266	20267	the bartender	488	“ What can I get you ? ”
20312	20317	20318	20318	she	352	“ This is mine , ”
20334	20347	20318	20318	she	352	“ We can just stay over here , away from the crowd . ”
20348	20351	20318	20318	she	352	“ Okay . ”
20520	20530	20531	20556	A woman in a black dress with long blond hair and a stocky , dark - haired guy in a suit sauntered up to the table	560	“ Well , well . Look who showed up . ”
20587	20590	20593	20593	Felicity	148	“ Mimi . ”
20605	20610	20593	20593	Felicity	148	“ You remember Hutton . ”
20611	20616	20617	20617	Mimi	412	“ Not like this . ”
20640	20647	20634	20634	she	412	“ Nice to see you again . ”
20670	20673	20657	20657	I	441	“ Hi . ”
20674	20681	20682	20682	she	412	“ From band geek to billionaire , ”
20688	20694	20682	20682	she	412	“ Who ’d have thought ? ”
20695	20698	20700	20700	Felicity	148	“ Me , ”
20702	20717	20700	20700	Felicity	148	“ I always knew he ’d be a huge success . He ’s brilliant . ”
20718	20728	20730	20730	Mimi	412	“ This is Thornton Van Pelt , my fiancé , ”
20749	20755	20757	20757	Thornton	107	“ Good to meet you , ”
20762	20774	20775	20775	Mimi	412	“ We ’re planning a June twentieth wedding , next year . ”
20786	20791	20775	20775	Mimi	412	“ What about you ? ”
20792	20796	20797	20797	Felicity	148	“ This year . ”
20804	20808	20797	20797	Felicity	148	“ Next month . ”
20809	20813	20814	20814	Mimi	412	“ Next month ? ”
20819	20822	20814	20814	Mimi	412	“ August ? ”
20823	20826	20827	20827	Felicity	148	“ Yes . ”
20833	20840	20841	20841	I	441	“ We just ca n’t wait . ”
20869	20890	20891	20891	she	412	“ I ’m just surprised I have n’t heard the news , what with Hutton being so famous and all , ”
20894	20900	20902	20902	Felicity	148	“ We ’re very private , ”
20904	20911	20902	20902	Felicity	148	“ We did n’t announce it . ”
20912	20918	20919	20919	Mimi	412	“ When did it happen ? ”
20922	20926	20927	20927	Felicity	148	“ Weeks ago , ”
20930	20936	20927	20927	Felicity	148	“ After he moved back . ”
20937	20940	20941	20941	Mimi	412	“ Really . ”
20949	20956	20941	20941	Mimi	412	“ That ’s sort of sudden . ”
20957	20971	20973	20973	Felicity	148	“ Well , we ’ve practically been best friends since we were twelve , ”
20975	20990	20991	20991	Mimi	412	“ But you were dating Zlatka up until very recently , were n’t you ? ”
21000	21012	21013	21013	Felicity	148	“ That ’s another reason why we did n’t announce it , ”
21020	21035	21013	21013	Felicity	148	“ We did n’t want to hurt anyone ’s feelings . Right , sweetie ? ”
21062	21069	21071	21071	Mimi	412	“ Tell me about your ring , ”
21073	21081	21083	21083	Felicity	148	“ Oh , it ’s so beautiful , ”
21085	21100	21083	21083	Felicity	148	“ A diamond solitaire . Really classic and stunning . Hutton has incredible taste . ”
21101	21113	21114	21114	She	412	“ How big is the diamond ? Mine is two carats . ”
21120	21125	21127	21127	Felicity	148	“ Mine ’s three , ”
21130	21142	21143	21143	Mimi	412	“ And the diamond is conflict - free . Ethically sourced . ”
21147	21150	21143	21143	Mimi	412	“ Cut ? ”
21151	21154	21143	21143	Mimi	412	“ Round . ”
21155	21158	21143	21143	Mimi	412	“ Band ? ”
21159	21162	21143	21143	Mimi	412	“ Platinum . ”
21163	21168	21169	21170	That one	562	“ Color and clarity ? ”
21178	21183	21175	21175	she	412	“ Color and what ? ”
21184	21187	21188	21188	Mimi	412	“ Clarity . ”
21194	21198	21188	21188	Mimi	412	“ Keep up . ”
21199	21205	21206	21206	Felicity	148	“ Uh , I forget , ”
21209	21220	21221	21221	Mimi	412	“ You forget the color and clarity of your diamond ? ”
21235	21241	21242	21242	I	441	“ F and VVS one , ”
21282	21288	21289	21289	Mimi	412	“ F and VVS one ? ”
21292	21300	21301	21301	Thornton	107	“ Did you hear that , Thornton ? ”
21306	21316	21301	21301	Thornton	107	“ Yeah . Is n’t that what you have ? ”
21317	21320	21321	21321	she	412	“ No , ”
21330	21335	21321	21321	she	412	“ It is n’t . ”
21336	21342	21343	21343	Felicity	148	“ Hutton spoils me silly . ”
21351	21389	21343	21343	Felicity	148	“ But what does it matter , right ? The ring is n’t the most important thing . It ’s just a piece of metal and rock . The real worth is in the love you share . ”
21390	21396	21398	21398	Thornton	107	“ Tell that to her , ”
21410	21422	21398	21398	Thornton	107	“ I ’ll be right back . I need another drink . ”
21435	21446	21398	21398	Thornton	107	“ What about your dress ? Where ’s it from ? ”
21447	21450	21451	21451	Felicity	148	“ Paris , ”
21454	21459	21451	21451	Felicity	148	“ It ’s French . ”
21460	21467	21468	21468	she	412	“ I know where Paris is , ”
21471	21477	21468	21468	she	412	“ How about the reception ? ”
21478	21495	21451	21451	Felicity	148	“ Cloverleigh Farms , of course . But it ’s very intimate — just immediate family . ”
21506	21517	21500	21500	Mimi	412	“ Sounds like you ’ve got it all worked out . ”
21518	21522	21523	21523	Felicity	148	“ We do . ”
21536	21542	21500	21500	Mimi	412	“ We ’re very happy . ”
21543	21553	21554	21554	Mimi	412	“ Well , congratulations on keeping it a secret . ”
21559	21566	21554	21554	Mimi	412	“ That must have been hard . ”
21567	21579	21580	21580	Felicity	148	“ Well , it ’s actually still sort of a secret . ”
21584	21604	21580	21580	Felicity	148	“ We have n’t really announced anything official yet , so if you would n’t mind keeping it quiet ? ”
21605	21610	21611	21611	Mimi	412	“ Say no more . ”
21617	21632	21633	21633	I	441	“ If you ’ll just excuse me , I ’m going to find Thornton . ”
21644	21658	21659	21659	She	412	“ You know she ’s going to tell everyone she knows , right ? ”
21673	21680	21659	21659	She	412	“ Yeah . I ’m sorry . ”
21681	21691	21692	21692	I	441	“ You do n’t have to apologize to me . ”
21699	21722	21723	21723	Her	412	“ But if she starts spilling the news right now , we might be swamped with people trying to get the scoop . ”
21732	21744	21723	21723	Her	412	“ You ’re right . Let ’s get out of here . ”
21753	21771	21723	21723	Her	412	“ You never have to ask me to leave a party twice . What about your appetizers ? ”
21772	21778	21779	21779	She	412	“ I can leave them . ”
21788	21812	21779	21779	She	412	“ I ’ll pick up the platters tomorrow , and my warming bags are already in the car . Let ’s just go . ”
21872	21891	21867	21867	she	412	“ I think we ’re safe . God , that was fun . Did you see her face ? ”
21898	21914	21892	21892	I	441	“ I had no idea what was going to come out of your mouth next . ”
21915	21919	21867	21867	she	412	“ Me neither . ”
21920	21926	21927	21927	I	441	“ Where are you parked ? ”
21930	21934	21935	21935	She	412	“ Right here . ”
21942	21945	21935	21935	She	412	“ You ? ”
21946	21952	21953	21953	I	441	“ I ’m over there . ”
21963	21973	21953	21953	I	441	“ But I ’ll walk you to your car . ”
21974	21977	21978	21978	She	412	“ Thanks . ”
21990	22002	21978	21978	She	412	“ Smells like a storm is coming , does n’t it ? ”
22003	22006	22007	22007	We	573	“ Yeah . ”
22015	22021	22007	22007	We	573	“ You still hate them ? ”
22022	22040	22041	22041	She	412	“ I do n’t really hate them , they just . . . put me on edge . ”
22046	22054	22041	22041	She	412	“ You going back to poker night ? ”
22055	22059	22060	22060	I	441	“ Hell no . ”
22074	22091	22071	22071	she	412	“ Well , you can go home early and tell her I kept you out late . ”
22113	22121	22104	22104	I	441	“ Do you want to come over ? ”
22122	22129	22104	22104	I	441	“ Sure . Have you eaten ? ”
22130	22138	22104	22104	I	441	“ No . Want to order in ? ”
22139	22156	22104	22104	I	441	“ Or I could make us something . Do you have any food at your house ? ”
22157	22163	22104	22104	I	441	“ I ’m not sure . ”
22194	22205	22206	22206	she	576	“ I ’ll hit the store on my way over , ”
22216	22224	22225	22225	She	576	“ My cooking is better than takeout . ”
22237	22246	22225	22225	She	576	“ I ’ll see you in a few ? ”
22247	22251	22252	22252	I	441	“ Sounds good . ”
22297	22306	22307	22307	she	576	“ Thanks a lot for coming here tonight , ”
22310	22319	22307	22307	she	576	“ I know it was hard for you . ”
22363	22378	22379	22379	She	576	“ I did n’t have a choice , remember ? You used the code . ”
22405	22427	22390	22390	she	576	“ I promise I wo n’t use it again unless it ’s a real emergency . Anyway , you were amazing . ”
22446	22458	22390	22390	she	576	“ It was all you . I only said three words . ”
22459	22462	22390	22390	she	576	“ Really ? ”
22463	22496	22497	22497	She	576	“ Yes , I said ‘ hi , ’ I said ‘ F , ’ and I said ‘ VVS one . ’ Some of that might not even count as words . ”
22505	22543	22544	22544	Her	576	“ I guess I did do all the talking — all the lying , I mean . Which is going to turn into a big mess tomorrow once Mimi opens her mouth . But do n’t worry . ”
22553	22561	22544	22544	Her	576	“ I promise to clean it up . ”
22562	22567	22568	22568	I	441	“ I trust you , ”
22572	22588	22589	22589	She	576	“ And actually I enjoyed watching you take her down a notch every thirty seconds . ”
22597	22627	22589	22589	She	576	“ Not gon na lie , it felt pretty good . And if I never get engaged for real , at least I ’ll have the memory of tonight . ”
22643	22646	22647	22647	I	441	“ Hey , ”
22658	22674	22675	22675	She	576	“ Why do n’t I follow you to the store ? We can shop together . ”
22679	22684	22675	22675	She	576	“ You hate shopping . ”
22685	22717	22647	22647	I	441	“ I hate shopping alone . But I wo n’t be alone — I’ll have you . And I want to buy the groceries , since you ’re cooking for me . ”
22718	22721	22722	22722	she	576	“ Okay , ”
22728	22732	22722	22722	she	576	“ Follow me . ”
22996	23004	23005	23005	I	441	“ God , I love your kitchen . ”
23021	23033	23005	23005	I	441	“ I feel like I ’m in a dream right now . ”
23034	23045	23046	23046	Hutton	148	“ That ’s because you gave me the shitty job . ”
23059	23068	23046	23046	Hutton	148	“ Sorry . Even I hate chopping onions . ”
23082	23105	23069	23069	I	441	“ But if I got to do it in this kitchen every day , even that job would n’t feel so bad . ”
23141	23148	23149	23149	I	441	“ Yeah . It ’s nice . ”
23179	23204	23168	23168	I	441	“ It ’s more than nice . It ’s probably good I do n’t have this kitchen . I ’d never leave my house . ”
23205	23225	23226	23226	He	148	“ You ’re welcome to use mine whenever you want . But not if you make me chop onions . ”
23234	23241	23226	23226	He	148	“ Here . I ’m done . ”
23242	23245	23246	23246	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
23362	23369	23370	23370	he	148	“ What ’s my next task ? ”
23373	23379	23380	23380	He	148	“ Is the water boiling ? ”
23393	23396	23380	23380	He	148	“ Yes . ”
23397	23407	23408	23408	He	148	“ Okay . I need a large sauté pan . ”
23419	23436	23408	23408	He	148	“ I have a bunch of pans . I ’m not sure which one you need . ”
23448	23468	23439	23439	I	441	“ You do have a bunch — and they ’re very nice . Did they come with the house ? ”
23469	23491	23492	23492	My	441	“ No . The house was furnished , but I hired someone to stock the kitchen with anything I might need . ”
23497	23503	23492	23492	My	441	“ That ’s a thing ? ”
23504	23511	23512	23512	He	148	“ Sure — for a price . ”
23529	23563	23492	23492	My	441	“ So you just say , ‘ I want a kitchen full of beautiful things , here ’s my credit card ? ’ And you do n’t have to shop for anything yourself ? ”
23564	23597	23492	23492	My	441	“ Exactly . That ’s the best part about making a lot of money — you can pay people to do the things you do n’t want to do , like shopping . ”
23598	23606	23607	23607	I	441	“ You should have just asked me , ”
23610	23626	23607	23607	I	441	“ I would have enjoyed it , and I would have done it for free . ”
23627	23639	23492	23492	My	441	“ I would n’t have let you do it for free . ”
23640	23664	23665	23665	I	441	“ Then I would have taken your money and blown it on good food and wine for us . I need olive oil , ”
23690	23694	23676	23676	He	590	“ What else ? ”
23695	23719	23720	23720	He	590	“ Dump the gnocchi in the water and keep an eye on them . Let me know when they float to the top . ”
23740	23748	23749	23749	I	441	“ So what ’s the worst part ? ”
23773	23776	23749	23749	I	441	“ Huh ? ”
23777	23810	23811	23811	He	590	“ You said being able to pay people to do things you do n’t want to do is the best part of making lots of money — so what ’s the worst ? ”
23817	23853	23811	23811	He	590	“ People assume things about you . Like that you ’re greedy or a scammer or you cheated somehow . Especially with crypto , because it ’s not easy for the average person to understand . ”
23854	23866	23867	23867	I	441	“ Like me . I do n’t get it at all , ”
23877	23890	23891	23891	he	590	“ Oh shit — I did n’t mean that to sound insulting , ”
23895	23898	23899	23899	I	441	“ Relax . ”
23904	23954	23899	23899	I	441	“ I know what you meant . And it ’s true — if you ’re not in the banking industry , crypto is not easy to understand . And when people ca n’t understand something , especially when it relates to huge sums of money , it seems sketchy . ”
23955	24048	23899	23899	I	441	“ There are sketchy people in crypto . And U.S. regulators love to find them and shut their operations down . But I ’m not one of them . And HFX is n’t perfect , but the industry is moving so fast , it ’s hard for regulators to keep up . If they wanted to work with us , they could — we could find the balance between growing the industry and preventing crimes and enforcing laws they want in place . But they ’re often more interested in playing gotcha . ”
24049	24056	24057	24057	I	441	“ It probably sells more newspapers , ”
24067	24075	24057	24057	I	441	“ And gets them re - elected . ”
24083	24098	24076	24076	Hutton	148	“ I have to testify in front of the House Committee on Financial Services . ”
24103	24111	24076	24076	Hutton	148	“ The House , meaning U.S. Congress ? ”
24112	24141	24076	24076	Hutton	148	“ That ’s the one . I have n’t said anything about it because I was hoping to delay it . Or better yet , avoid it altogether . ”
24163	24169	24170	24170	He	148	“ When will it happen ? ”
24178	24187	24170	24170	He	148	“ In about three weeks . July 28th . ”
24188	24194	24170	24170	He	148	“ Holy shit . Alone ? ”
24195	24206	24170	24170	He	148	“ No , there will be five other CEOs there . ”
24207	24215	24170	24170	He	148	“ Well , that helps , right ? ”
24216	24240	24170	24170	He	148	“ I guess . Unless everyone else sounds like they know what they ’re talking about and I sound like a fucking idiot . ”
24241	24246	24247	24247	I	441	“ You wo n’t . ”
24255	24267	24247	24247	I	441	“ Ca n’t your partner testify instead of you ? Wade ? ”
24268	24358	24359	24359	He	594	“ He ’ll be there , but Wade does n’t do what I do . He ’s East Coast old money , a member of the club , knows all the right people — but that ’s not necessarily helpful in this situation . Wade had the capital to invest at the start and he ’s good with people , which is why we ’re a good team , but he does n’t know the back end like I do . The things are floating , by the way . ”
24365	24372	24373	24373	Hutton	148	“ Good . Got a colander ? ”
24396	24409	24410	24410	I	441	“ So do you have a choice whether or not to testify ? ”
24413	24459	24410	24410	I	441	“ Not really . I mean , I could cash out of HFX and abandon the algorithm I created along with the company I co - founded . But that would look fucking terrible . Like I was a criminal or had things to hide . ”
24460	24468	24410	24410	I	441	“ So you have to do it ? ”
24469	24476	24488	24488	I	441	“ I have to do it . ”
24477	24487	24488	24488	I	441	“ Well , I think you ’ll be great , ”
24507	24515	24516	24516	He	594	“ I have full confidence in you . ”
24519	24527	24516	24516	He	594	“ Are you forgetting who I am ? ”
24528	24544	24545	24545	I	441	“ Not at all ! I know exactly who you are . You got this . ”
24747	24764	24765	24765	I	441	“ So were you shocked when you got that text from me with the encrypted message ? ”
24768	24785	24786	24786	I	441	“ Yes . I ’m ashamed to say it took me a minute to recognize it . ”
24789	24800	24786	24786	I	441	“ I had to write out the cipher key first . ”
24801	24804	24805	24805	Hutton	148	“ Same . ”
24815	24827	24805	24805	Hutton	148	“ But I think about that night in the library sometimes . ”
24838	24842	24805	24805	Hutton	148	“ You do ? ”
24843	24846	24847	24847	He	148	“ Yeah . ”
24855	24866	24847	24847	He	148	“ I remember . . . what you told me . ”
24867	24874	24875	24875	He	148	“ About Carla — my mother ? ”
24878	24886	24875	24875	He	148	“ Do you ever talk to her ? ”
24887	24904	24905	24905	My	441	“ Not really . She reaches out every once in a while , but . . . ”
24910	24952	24905	24905	My	441	“ It was pretty obvious when she left that Mom was a role she was done playing . According to her , she never wanted it in the first place . At least , that ’s what she said that night . ”
24953	24969	24970	24970	Hutton	148	“ That must have been hard . I always wondered . . . never mind . ”
24975	24983	24984	24984	He	148	“ What ? You can ask me . ”
24992	25011	24984	24984	He	148	“ I guess I just wondered how that happened . How you overheard it — what she said . ”
25012	25031	24905	24905	My	441	“ I was eavesdropping on a fight my parents were having after I was supposed to be asleep . ”
25032	25035	25036	25036	He	148	“ Oh . ”
25041	25124	25036	25036	He	148	“ There was a huge thunderstorm that night , and those always made me nervous . I used to go to my parents ’ room and ask if I could sleep in their bed . Sometimes they ’d let me , other times my dad would tuck me back into my bed again and stay with me until I fell asleep . But that night , when I got out of bed and crept into the hall , I heard them fighting . ”
25125	25130	25131	25131	Hutton	148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
25135	25143	25131	25131	Hutton	148	“ They fought a lot back then . ”
25380	25425	25426	25426	Hutton	148	“ I heard her say , ‘ I never wanted your kids in the first place . I hardly want them now . ’ I remember curling my body into a ball underneath the covers , like I was trying to make myself disappear . ”
25434	25527	25426	25426	Hutton	148	“ He told her she did n’t know what she was saying . That she did n’t mean it . And she said he was n’t in charge of her thoughts and did n’t get to decide how she felt about being a mother . She said she was sick and tired of her life . And when he said they could talk about it tomorrow and they should just go to bed , she said she ’d already been to bed with someone that night , and it was n’t him . ”
25528	25531	25533	25533	Hutton	148	“ Fuck , ”
25535	25554	25555	25555	I	441	“ It confused me . I did n’t understand why my mother would have a bed somewhere else . ”
25560	25590	25555	25555	I	441	“ My dad said he was tired of the arguing and she should just say what she wanted , and her answer was , ‘ I want out . ’ ”
25591	25604	25605	25605	I	441	“ And she did n’t want to take you guys with her ? ”
25609	25638	25639	25639	He	607	“ No . But she would n’t have been able to anyway . The first thing my dad said was , ‘ The girls stay with me . ’ ”
25642	25648	25639	25639	He	607	“ Good for your dad . ”
25649	25713	25714	25714	I	441	“ He ’s the best . And that did make me feel good — at least my dad still loved me . But it messed with my head , you know ? Hearing my mother say those things . Up to that point , I thought all moms wanted kids . Suddenly that was n’t true . My mother did n’t want me . ”
25717	25757	25714	25714	I	441	“ I went back into the bedroom and over to the desk where Millie had been working on a project for school , and I picked up the scissors . That was the first time I cut my hair . ”
25758	25761	25639	25639	He	607	“ Ah . ”
25762	25791	25714	25714	I	441	“ The next morning , everyone asked me why I ’d done it , and I made something up . I never told anyone what I ’d overheard . ”
25792	25795	25796	25796	I	441	“ Never ? ”
25801	25895	25796	25796	I	441	“ No . I was scared of getting in trouble . All I could think of was that a good girl would not have listened . I was young , but I knew eavesdropping was wrong . I did n’t want my dad to be mad , I did n’t want my sisters to be hurt , and I was too ashamed to tell my friends . When they asked me why my mom moved out , I lied and said she had to go take care of her sick grandmother in Georgia . ”
25896	25910	25714	25714	I	441	“ That ’s a lot of baggage for a kid to carry around . ”
25911	25919	25920	25920	He	608	“ It was . But I survived . ”
25923	25937	25920	25920	He	608	“ I ’m curious . What made you tell me at the library ? ”
25938	25941	25942	25942	I	441	“ Honestly ? ”
25961	25974	25975	25975	Hutton	148	“ I have to confess — it was kind of an accident . ”
25992	25998	25975	25975	Hutton	148	“ What do you mean ? ”
25999	26015	26025	26025	He	608	“ Well , you know how I sometimes say random things when I get nervous ? ”
26016	26024	26025	26025	He	608	“ Like being engaged to a billionaire ? ”
26037	26045	26046	26046	I	441	“ That our wedding is next month ? ”
26049	26060	26046	26046	I	441	“ Exactly . The library was one of those times . ”
26061	26071	26077	26077	I	441	“ What were you nervous about at the library ? ”
26085	26097	26077	26077	I	441	“ It ’s too embarrassing . I ca n’t tell you . ”
26098	26102	26103	26103	He	608	“ Come on . ”
26110	26119	26103	26103	He	608	“ You ’re going to laugh at me . ”
26120	26128	26129	26129	I	441	“ I wo n’t . I promise . ”
26135	26149	26129	26129	I	441	“ Okay . I was nervous because I thought you might kiss me . ”
26150	26159	26160	26160	He	608	“ And you did n’t want me to . ”
26165	26168	26169	26169	I	441	“ What ? ”
26176	26237	26238	26238	He	608	“ No ! I totally wanted you to . But I ’d never kissed a boy before , and I had no idea how to do it . I was like , ‘ What if it ’s awkward ? What if my glasses get in the way ? What do I do with my gum ? ’ Then I panicked . ”
26243	26323	26238	26238	He	608	“ Sorry , I know I said I would n’t laugh , but the two of us were having the exact same moment of panic . I wanted to kiss you and could n’t bring myself to make a move . My head was racing with all these ways it could go wrong , and I was n’t sure you even wanted me to kiss you in the first place . I thought maybe I was misreading the signs . ”
26324	26329	26330	26330	I	441	“ You were n’t , ”
26337	26366	26330	26330	I	441	“ God , can you imagine what we must have looked like ? Sitting there on the edges of our seats , our faces inches apart . . . ”
26367	26373	26375	26375	Hutton	148	“ I was sweating buckets , ”
26377	26386	26375	26375	Hutton	148	“ It was probably dripping off my forehead . ”
26387	26439	26330	26330	I	441	“ I did n’t notice . But it felt like an eternity went by and nothing happened , so I figured you must not see me like that . I had to say something to break the tension , and for whatever reason , the thing about my mom came out . ”
26440	26457	26458	26458	I	441	“ I remember having no clue what to say . So I wrote the encoded note . ”
26461	26474	26458	26458	I	441	“ That was the perfect response . It made me feel better . ”
26475	26478	26479	26479	We	610	“ Good . ”
26587	26606	26584	26584	he	614	“ It ’s probably good that we did n’t mess around back then . Do n’t you think ? ”
26614	26630	26607	26607	I	441	“ Oh , yeah . Definitely . It would have made things weird with us . ”
26631	26634	26635	26635	he	614	“ Right , ”
26647	26674	26644	26644	his	614	“ I mean , it ’s hard to say for sure , but you ’re probably right . It might not have been worth the risk . ”
26764	26778	26779	26779	I	441	“ I bet you ’re the only billionaire washing pots and pans tonight , ”
26782	26785	26786	26786	he	614	“ Probably , ”
26789	26796	26797	26797	I	441	“ I think it ’s good . ”
26802	26825	26797	26797	I	441	“ Shows character . Like you have n’t forgotten where you came from . Hand them to me and I ’ll dry . ”
26858	26872	26873	26873	I	441	“ Do you want to stay a little longer ? Finish the wine ? ”
26876	26892	26873	26873	I	441	“ If we finish that bottle , I wo n’t be able to drive home . ”
26893	26898	26899	26899	he	614	“ So stay over , ”
26902	26910	26899	26899	he	614	“ I have plenty of guest rooms . ”
26911	26915	26916	26916	I	441	“ A sleepover ? ”
26928	26940	26941	26941	He	614	“ Before we ’re married ? What would the townsfolk say ? ”
26954	26984	26941	26941	He	614	“ They ’re probably already talking about us . Come on , let ’s go out on the deck . I do n’t think the rain has started yet . ”
27071	27082	27057	27057	I	441	“ It ’s so dark out here . So isolated . ”
27083	27093	27094	27094	I	441	“ That ’s what sold me on the place . ”
27101	27110	27094	27094	I	441	“ You ’re such a grumpy old man . ”
27111	27125	27057	27057	I	441	“ I ’m twenty - eight . I ’m a grumpy young man . ”
27126	27136	27137	27137	I	441	“ Fine . You ’re a grumpy young man . ”
27142	27183	27137	27137	I	441	“ But you know what ? You have to deal with a lot of people wanting to be up in your personal business all the time , so I should n’t criticize . You deserve privacy when you want it . ”
27184	27193	27194	27194	I	441	“ Can you please tell my mother that ? ”
27197	27206	27194	27194	I	441	“ I wonder what happened with Cleopatra tonight . ”
27207	27230	27137	27137	I	441	“ No idea . She said she was going to introduce her to Harvey . He ’s my dad ’s widowed friend . ”
27231	27246	27194	27194	I	441	“ Aw , that ’s nice . She just wants people to be happy . ”
27247	27257	27258	27258	Hutton	148	“ You can be happy without a serious relationship , ”
27265	27268	27258	27258	Hutton	148	“ True . ”
27285	27298	27277	27277	I	441	“ Unless you ’re lonely , or you really want a family . ”
27299	27305	27306	27306	he	148	“ I ’m never lonely , ”
27309	27315	27316	27316	I	441	“ What about a family ? ”
27319	27331	27332	27332	Hutton	148	“ Do you ever think about getting married ? Having kids ? ”
27341	27357	27332	27332	Hutton	148	“ Not really . I do n’t know if I ’d make a good dad . ”
27392	27408	27374	27374	I	441	“ What makes you say that ? You ’re great with your nieces and nephew . ”
27409	27441	27442	27442	He	148	“ Yeah , but being an uncle is different . It ’s less pressure . You can just have fun with them . You ’re not really responsible for their upbringing . ”
27445	27492	27442	27442	He	148	“ I do n’t know if I ’d have the temperament to be a good dad . I get really irritated and impatient sometimes . I can be irrational and stubborn . My brother - in - law , Neil , is so easygoing and relaxed . ”
27493	27536	27537	27537	I	441	“ All different kinds of people can be great dads . My dad was stubborn too . He definitely got irritated . And he had such a foul mouth , the swear jaw would be overflowing by the end of the week . ”
27559	27572	27573	27573	Hutton	148	“ He was n’t perfect . But he was an awesome dad . ”
27587	27597	27573	27573	Hutton	148	“ What about you ? Do you want kids ? ”
27598	27612	27573	27573	Hutton	148	“ I do , but I need to figure some stuff out first . ”
27613	27619	27620	27620	I	441	“ What kind of stuff ? ”
27625	27634	27635	27635	He	148	“ How to be in a healthy relationship . ”
27639	27659	27635	27635	He	148	“ I ’ve got no advice on that front . I ’d be an even shittier husband than father . ”
27660	27667	27635	27635	He	148	“ What makes you think that ? ”
27668	27671	27635	27635	He	148	“ Experience . ”
27672	27676	27677	27677	I	441	“ Oh yeah ? ”
27682	27702	27703	27703	He	148	“ Is there a wife you ’re hiding somewhere ? As your fake fiancée , I should know this . ”
27710	27744	27703	27703	He	148	“ No , I ’ve never been married . But I ’ve tried to have relationships , and I suck at them . I have literally been told that I suck at them . ”
27745	27751	27752	27752	He	148	“ That ’s not nice . ”
27755	27760	27752	27752	He	148	“ It ’s honest . ”
27761	27774	27703	27703	He	148	“ I guess I ’d value kindness over honesty in that situation . ”
27775	27788	27789	27789	I	441	“ Did n’t matter . And I did n’t even really care . ”
27803	27810	27789	27789	I	441	“ Are we talking about Zlatka ? ”
27811	27854	27752	27752	He	148	“ She ’s the one who told me I sucked most recently , but she ’s not the only one who felt that way — and I never blamed them . No one wants to date a recluse who hates going places . ”
27855	27868	27789	27789	I	441	“ That ’s all it was ? You never liked going out ? ”
27869	27901	27902	27902	He	148	“ That was a lot of it . But there were other problems too . I ’m not good at talking about things . I ’m better at — never mind . ”
27919	27922	27925	27925	him	148	“ What ? ”
27928	27932	27923	27923	I	441	“ Tell me . ”
27933	27946	27947	27947	My	441	“ I ’m better at the physical stuff than the emotional stuff . ”
27961	27967	27947	27947	My	441	“ You mean sex stuff ? ”
27968	27971	27923	27923	I	441	“ Yeah . ”
27972	27980	27981	27981	I	441	“ Well , that ’s important too , ”
28004	28011	28012	28012	He	148	“ Good physical chemistry with someone . ”
28022	28042	28012	28012	He	148	“ Actually , I do n’t even think Zlatka and I were that compatible when it came to sex . ”
28043	28047	28012	28012	He	148	“ Why not ? ”
28048	28058	28059	28059	I	441	“ Certain things I liked , she did n’t . ”
28066	28070	28071	28071	He	148	“ Such as ? ”
28074	28101	28102	28102	I	441	“ Let ’s just say that Zlatka does not like being told what to do or not do , and I enjoy that kind of control . ”
28113	28157	28102	28102	I	441	“ But there were other problems . She constantly accused me of avoiding any situation or conversation I did n’t want to be in , and she was right . I do avoid those . Eventually , our relationship fell into that category . ”
28158	28165	28102	28102	I	441	“ You do n’t miss her ? ”
28166	28181	28182	28182	He	148	“ Fuck no . She was exhausting . And I ’ve never missed anyone . ”
28187	28209	28210	28210	I	441	“ I mean , except for you . There have been many times in my life when I ’ve missed you . ”
28213	28216	28210	28210	I	441	“ Really ? ”
28217	28220	28210	28210	I	441	“ Yes . ”
28221	28228	28229	28229	Our	619	“ I ’ve missed you too . ”
28276	28279	28280	28280	He	148	“ Oh ! ”
28294	28298	28280	28280	He	148	“ You okay ? ”
28299	28304	28309	28309	I	441	“ Yes . Sorry . ”
28314	28321	28309	28309	I	441	“ Storms still make me jumpy . ”
28322	28328	28329	28329	Hutton	148	“ Let ’s go in . ”
28342	28358	28329	28329	Hutton	148	“ I ’ll show you the guest rooms , and you can take your pick . ”
28359	28371	28372	28372	I	441	“ Are you sure it ’s okay for me to stay ? ”
28379	28403	28404	28404	he	148	“ Yes . I could call and ask my mom , but I ’m pretty sure she ’d be in favor of it , ”
28416	28444	28404	28404	he	148	“ Mine too . Actually , I am going to text her and let her know I ’m staying here , just so she does n’t worry . ”
28445	28449	28453	28453	Hutton	148	“ Good idea . ”
28492	28497	28498	28498	I	441	“ This is perfect , ”
28513	28531	28507	28507	Hutton	148	“ The other two bedrooms are on the lower level , if you ’d like more privacy . ”
28532	28554	28555	28555	He	148	“ Listen , I ’ve been living with my parents and two teenage sisters for six months . This is heaven . ”
28558	28567	28555	28555	He	148	“ Okay . Can I get you anything ? ”
28568	28585	28555	28555	He	148	“ Got a spare toothbrush ? Maybe an old T - shirt I could sleep in ? ”
28586	28591	28593	28593	he	148	“ Be right back . ”
28680	28685	28656	28656	Hutton	148	“ Will this work ? ”
28686	28692	28693	28693	I	441	“ Yes . Thank you . ”
28727	28732	28719	28719	He	148	“ Need anything else ? ”
28733	28740	28719	28719	He	148	“ Nope . I ’m good . ”
28751	28755	28719	28719	He	148	“ You okay ? ”
28756	28759	28760	28760	I	441	“ No . ”
28774	28783	28768	28768	I	441	“ Can I sleep in your bed tonight ? ”
28790	28795	28796	28796	I	441	“ I ’m kidding , ”
28804	28821	28796	28796	I	441	“ Because of what I told you earlier . Do n’t worry , I wo n’t — ”
28822	28830	28768	28768	I	441	“ You can if you want to . ”
28831	28842	28796	28796	I	441	“ — actually crawl into your . . . huh ? ”
28843	28864	28796	28796	I	441	“ You can sleep in my bed . If you want to . I mean , if you ’re scared . ”
28898	28907	28894	28894	I	441	“ Thanks . But I ’ll be fine . ”
28908	28913	28914	28914	He	631	“ Okay . Goodnight . ”
29197	29202	29203	29203	I	441	“ This is crazy , ”
29259	29262	29263	29263	Felicity	148	“ Oh ! ”
29271	29282	29263	29263	Felicity	148	“ I was just . . . um . . . ”
29340	29343	29329	29329	she	119	“ Thirsty . ”
29344	29347	29348	29348	I	441	“ Right , ”
29351	29359	29348	29348	I	441	“ That ’s why I ’m here . ”
29360	29364	29329	29329	she	119	“ It is ? ”
29365	29398	29399	29399	I	441	“ Yes , I thought you might be thirsty and I forgot to tell you there are bottles of water in the fridge . Why do n’t I just get you one ? ”
29571	29583	29562	29562	Zlatka	560	“ I want you . Let ’s get out of here . ”
29643	29646	29641	29641	she	119	“ Hutton ? ”
29729	29739	29740	29740	She	119	“ Sorry , did n’t mean to scare you . ”
29744	29751	29740	29740	She	119	“ Did you find the water ? ”
29752	29757	29762	29762	I	441	“ Water . Yes . ”
29781	29786	29762	29762	I	441	“ Here you go . ”
29787	29790	29791	29791	She	119	“ Thanks . ”
29840	29853	29835	29835	her	119	“ I guess I ’ll . . . go back to bed . ”
29854	29857	29858	29858	She	119	“ Wait . ”
29862	29865	29858	29858	She	119	“ Yes ? ”
29883	29891	29892	29892	She	119	“ Did you cut your hair today ? ”
29898	29928	29892	29892	She	119	“ Oh . Yeah . This morning , after I saw the bad review on that app . It looks terrible , I know . It ’s all uneven . ”
29929	29941	29942	29942	She	119	“ Not at all . There ’s beauty in asymmetry too . ”
29979	29982	29974	29974	she	119	“ Night . ”
29983	29986	29974	29974	she	119	“ Night . ”
30489	30492	30452	30452	she	119	“ Hutton . ”
30509	30512	30514	30514	her	119	“ Hutton . ”
30534	30544	30522	30522	she	119	“ Hutton , wake up . Someone is here . ”
30604	30607	30593	30593	I	441	“ Huh ? ”
30608	30626	30600	30600	she	119	“ Someone is here , knocking on the door . I think it might be your mom . ”
30627	30631	30600	30600	she	119	“ My mom ? ”
30649	30652	30639	30639	I	441	“ Here ? ”
30653	30662	30663	30663	She	119	“ Yes . And maybe some other people . ”
30673	30690	30663	30663	She	119	“ I heard pounding and shouting , but I did n’t want to answer the door . ”
30729	30737	30741	30742	my mother	412	“ Hutton ! Are you in there ? ”
30759	30765	30748	30748	I	441	“ Go away , Mom . ”
30766	30784	30741	30742	my mother	412	“ I do n’t think she ’s going away . She ’s been knocking for several minutes . ”
30785	30788	30789	30789	I	441	“ Fuuuuuuck . ”
30805	30818	30748	30748	I	441	“ Why is she here so early ? What time is it ? ”
30819	30825	30741	30742	my mother	412	“ It ’s after ten . ”
30826	30836	30748	30748	I	441	“ Is it ? I never sleep this late . ”
30837	30850	30748	30748	I	441	“ Me neither . But I had trouble falling asleep last night . ”
30851	30855	30856	30856	I	441	“ Me too . ”
30879	30889	30890	30890	I	441	“ Was it the storm that kept you awake ? ”
30893	30901	30890	30890	I	441	“ It was a lot of things . ”
30902	30927	30928	30928	I	441	“ Hutton , darling , open up ! I looked in the garage and saw your car , so I know you ’re here ! ”
30960	30966	30957	30957	I	441	“ Give me a minute . ”
30967	30973	30974	30974	Felicity	148	“ I ’ll get dressed , ”
30977	30998	30974	30974	Felicity	148	“ No rush . I ’m just going to brush my teeth and then try to get rid of her . ”
31098	31104	31105	31105	I	441	“ What ’s going on ? ”
31116	31123	31105	31105	I	441	“ Why are you all here ? ”
31124	31144	31145	31146	my father	411	“ We were at the house rehearsing for the FitzGibbons ’ fiftieth anniversary luncheon when we heard the news , ”
31149	31159	31145	31146	my father	411	“ We gathered the troops and rushed right over . ”
31160	31165	31166	31167	my mother	412	“ Is it true ? ”
31176	31181	31166	31167	my mother	412	“ Is what true ? ”
31195	31200	31166	31167	my mother	412	“ There she is ! ”
31214	31223	31209	31209	her	412	“ It ’s true ! It ’s true ! ”
31287	31298	31275	31275	her	412	“ Sweetest Felicity , this is better than a dream ! ”
31299	31303	31304	31304	Felicity	148	“ It is ? ”
31347	31374	31342	31342	she	412	“ I do n’t know if I can contain my emotions . The two of you — after all this time — engaged to be married ! ”
31403	31417	31418	31419	My brother	1652	“ You jerk ! Since when can you keep a secret from me ? ”
31439	31448	31425	31425	Neil	77	“ You should have said something , man . ”
31449	31457	31458	31459	my mom	412	“ But it makes perfect sense now ! ”
31465	31488	31458	31459	my mom	412	“ No wonder he always protested so much when I tried to help him find love . He ’d already found it ! ”
31489	31497	31499	31499	Zosia	412	“ But why was it a secret ? ”
31507	31514	31499	31499	Zosia	412	“ I do n’t get it . ”
31515	31546	31548	31549	my sister	412	“ Because when you ’re someone like Hutton , the media is always prying into your business , and taking a relationship public puts a lot of pressure on it , ”
31551	31556	31548	31549	my sister	412	“ Right , Hutton ? ”
31557	31562	31499	31499	Zosia	412	“ Uh , yes . ”
31563	31603	31604	31605	My mother	412	“ And the sad eyes and discontent aura I sensed yesterday must have been his yearning to share the news with us , but feeling protective of his blossoming love ! But in retrospect , it was right there . ”
31623	31630	31617	31617	Her	412	“ Gentlemen . A song please ? ”
31656	31661	31647	31647	Harvey	109	“ Congratulations to you , ”
31676	31690	31691	31691	they	662	“ Congratulations to you . Congratulations on your engagement , congratulations toooooo youuuuuuu , ”
31718	31721	31710	31710	Felicity	148	“ Pic ! ”
31731	31735	31728	31728	her	412	“ Everyone in ! ”
31798	31805	31806	31806	she	412	“ How about smiling this time ? ”
31812	31827	31806	31806	she	412	“ Hutton and Felicity , you two look like you ’ve seen a ghost . ”
31865	31873	31874	31875	my mother	412	“ Now one of the happy couple , ”
31884	31894	31878	31878	I	441	“ Mom , really , this is n’t the — ”
31895	31904	31905	31905	she	412	“ Oh , now do n’t be shy , ”
31915	31938	31905	31905	she	412	“ Put your arm around her , Hutton ! You ’re in love ! And the poor girl is trembling with excitement . ”
31960	31976	31977	31977	Felicity	148	“ Um , Mrs. French , everyone , there ’s something I need to explain , ”
31980	31987	31977	31977	Felicity	148	“ Please . Call me Mom . ”
31996	32038	32039	32039	She	412	“ And there ’s nothing to explain . It ’s the oldest story in the book — boy meets girl , they ’re just friends for years , then they realize that there ’s always been something more there . . . ”
32044	32066	32039	32039	She	412	“ It ’s like the universe has answered all my prayers . Now I can stop worrying about you , Hutton . ”
32067	32071	32039	32039	She	412	“ You can ? ”
32072	32075	32076	32076	She	412	“ Yes . ”
32080	32105	32106	32106	Felicity	148	“ No more trying to set you up , because clearly you ’ve realized that your soul mate has been right here all along . ”
32111	32121	32106	32106	Felicity	148	“ I ’m so sorry about this , but — ”
32122	32128	32129	32130	My mother	412	“ Do n’t be sorry . ”
32133	32168	32169	32169	she	412	“ We understand wanting to keep the news to yourselves . It ’s only natural to want to hold a secret like that close to your heart . But now that it ’s out , ”
32174	32192	32169	32169	she	412	“ I ca n’t wait to celebrate ! And is it true the wedding is next month ? ”
32193	32198	32169	32169	she	412	“ Uh . . . ”
32208	32215	32169	32169	she	412	“ Where did you hear that ? ”
32216	32224	32226	32227	my sister	412	“ Oh , the news is everywhere , ”
32229	32276	32277	32277	She	412	“ Online , local morning news , social media . You ’ve been secretly engaged for weeks , and you ’re having a very intimate wedding at Cloverleigh Farms in August . At least five friends texted me the headlines and asked if it was true . ”
32280	32302	32277	32277	She	412	“ I had my doubts , but Mom was positive the universe would not play such a cruel trick on her . ”
32303	32323	32324	32325	my mother	412	“ And I was right ! Just look at them — it ’s obvious what ’s been going on , ”
32342	32349	32351	32351	Neil	77	“ Hope we did n’t interrupt , ”
32356	32360	32351	32351	Neil	77	“ Say cheese ! ”
32367	32373	32351	32351	Neil	77	“ How about a kiss ? ”
32374	32378	32383	32383	Felicity	148	“ A what ? ”
32394	32398	32386	32386	I	441	“ A kiss ! ”
32406	32417	32386	32386	I	441	“ For the camera . For prosperity . For love ! ”
32418	32421	32422	32423	my sister	412	“ Exactly , ”
32432	32438	32422	32423	my sister	412	“ Kiss her , Hutton . ”
32495	32502	32490	32492	the Clipper Cuts	125	“ Let Me Call You Sweetheart . ”
32580	32588	32589	32590	my sister	412	“ Okay , I got the picture , ”
32599	32604	32606	32606	Neil	77	“ Get a room ! ”
32608	32620	32622	32622	Zosia	412	“ That ’s gross . Can we have the donuts now ? ”
32642	32648	32649	32649	she	412	“ I’m — I’m confused , ”
32652	32657	32649	32649	she	412	“ Come with me . ”
32674	32679	32680	32680	Neil	77	“ I was kidding ! ”
32686	32693	32680	32680	Neil	77	“ Oh , let them go , ”
32698	32716	32680	32680	Neil	77	“ They probably need a moment to themselves — we barged right into their love nest unannounced . ”
32746	32751	32752	32752	she	412	“ Oh my God , ”
32755	32761	32752	32752	she	412	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
32762	32767	32769	32769	Felicity	148	“ Do n’t be . ”
32781	32827	32769	32769	Felicity	148	“ I should n’t have opened my big mouth to Mimi . I knew this would happen . I just did n’t think about the consequences of your family hearing the news and being so happy about it ! And it ’s not just them . ”
32828	32834	32752	32752	she	412	“ What do you mean ? ”
32835	32864	32769	32769	Felicity	148	“ When I turned on my phone this morning , I saw that Winnie had sent me a bunch of headlines about us — we’re front page news ! ”
32865	32869	32769	32769	Felicity	148	“ We are ? ”
32870	32925	32926	32926	She	672	“ Yes ! My follower count skyrocketed overnight . I ’ve got tons of DMs . My notifications on Dearly Beloved are blowing up . And my mother — Frannie , I mean — left me a voicemail , which I have n’t listened to , but I can imagine what it ’s about . ”
32938	32959	32926	32926	She	672	“ Now I have to tell everyone the truth — that I made it up . This is so embarrassing . ”
32960	32966	32967	32967	My	441	“ Okay , hang on . ”
32972	32983	32967	32967	My	441	“ Maybe we do n’t have to tell everyone that . ”
32984	32987	32988	32988	I	441	“ Huh ? ”
32996	33006	32988	32988	I	441	“ Maybe we can just — go with it . ”
33007	33012	32967	32967	My	441	“ Go with it ? ”
33013	33023	33024	33024	Her	672	“ Yes — for a little while at least . ”
33029	33032	33024	33024	Her	672	“ Why ? ”
33033	33054	33055	33055	Felicity	148	“ You heard my mother . She ’s finally going to leave me alone . Maybe everyone else will too . ”
33064	33069	33055	33055	Felicity	148	“ Are you serious ? ”
33070	33124	33125	33125	I	441	“ Yes . I ’m tired of being harassed by everyone around me about my lack of a personal life . I ’ve got a lot of work to do to get ready to testify , and if people think we ’re engaged , they ’ll give me the space to do it , ”
33171	33176	33129	33129	I	441	“ For how long ? ”
33177	33184	33185	33185	I	441	“ Just while I ’m here , ”
33188	33207	33208	33208	She	674	“ I only rented the house for three months . I have to be out by August fifteenth . ”
33213	33218	33208	33208	She	674	“ So one month ? ”
33219	33222	33223	33223	I	441	“ Right . ”
33252	33258	33259	33259	She	674	“ What do you think ? ”
33262	33280	33259	33259	She	674	“ I think there ’s going to be a lot of disappointed Prancin ’ Grannies out there . ”
33281	33288	33259	33259	She	674	“ So you ’ll do it ? ”
33289	33295	33259	33259	She	674	“ Of course I will . ”
33296	33316	33317	33317	She	674	“ It ’ll mean lying to your family . . . are you sure you ’re up for that ? ”
33326	33370	33317	33317	She	674	“ But we ’re not hurting anyone . My family will actually be overjoyed . The only problem will be when we have to end it . But I guess we could just call it off when you go back to San Francisco . ”
33371	33375	33391	33391	She	674	“ Sounds reasonable . ”
33376	33390	33391	33391	She	674	“ Except that I said we were getting married next month ! Shit ! ”
33402	33414	33391	33391	She	674	“ Look , let ’s not worry about that right now . ”
33415	33432	33433	33433	Felicity	148	“ But we have to get the story straight , Hutton . We need a script . ”
33442	33451	33433	33433	Felicity	148	“ Otherwise I ’m liable to go rogue . ”
33452	33461	33462	33462	I	441	“ We can come up with a story . ”
33469	33483	33484	33484	Felicity	148	“ For now , let ’s just try to get rid of them . ”
33487	33503	33484	33484	Felicity	148	“ Maybe if we just stay in your bedroom , they ’ll take a hint . ”
33512	33516	33484	33484	Felicity	148	“ I wish . ”
33578	33585	33587	33588	my mother	412	“ Come sit , you two , ”
33602	33615	33587	33588	my mother	412	“ We want to hear all about how you popped the question . ”
33616	33623	33624	33624	I	441	“ That ’s private , Mom . ”
33636	33644	33645	33645	Allie	73	“ Come on , just tell us , ”
33648	33656	33657	33657	Felicity	148	“ And let ’s see the ring . ”
33667	33683	33657	33657	Felicity	148	“ The ring is actually still at the jeweler ’s . It ’s being sized . ”
33684	33698	33700	33700	Zosia	412	“ Grandma says this means you ’ve gotten over your emotional devoidance issues , ”
33712	33717	33700	33700	Zosia	412	“ Is that true ? ”
33718	33729	33730	33731	My sister	412	“ Emotional avoidance issues , and do n’t say that . ”
33739	33755	33730	33731	My sister	412	“ Just tell me — did he get down on one knee when he proposed ? ”
33763	33768	33730	33731	My sister	412	“ Was it romantic ? ”
33787	33790	33791	33791	she	412	“ Yes , ”
33800	33813	33791	33791	she	412	“ He got down on one knee and it was very romantic . ”
33814	33819	33820	33820	Allie	73	“ Where were you ? ”
33823	33826	33827	33827	Felicity	148	“ Here . ”
33833	33839	33827	33827	Felicity	148	“ Out in the woods . ”
33840	33847	33848	33849	My mother	412	“ You proposed in the woods ? ”
33855	33874	33848	33849	My mother	412	“ That makes sense for an earth sign like Taurus . And what sign are you , Felicity ? ”
33875	33899	33900	33900	Felicity	148	“ I ’m a Cancer . My birthday just passed — in fact , that ’s when he asked me to marry him . ”
33907	33912	33900	33900	Felicity	148	“ On my birthday . ”
33913	33920	33921	33922	My mother	412	“ Oh , that ’s perfect . ”
33926	33939	33940	33940	Allie	73	“ An earthy bull is a wonderful match for a sensitive crab . ”
33949	33962	33963	33963	I	441	“ Mom , calling someone a sensitive crab is not a compliment , ”
33967	33979	33963	33963	I	441	“ I ’m saying you ’re going to be good together , ”
33985	34040	33963	33963	I	441	“ Both Taurus and Cancer are very family - oriented . But a Cancer might struggle with someone who is n’t in touch with his feelings , Hutton , so you ’ll have to take care not to let her down . She ’ll snatch her feelings right back into her little crab shell . ”
34041	34049	34050	34050	Allie	73	“ Let ’s talk about the wedding , ”
34053	34063	34050	34050	Allie	73	“ It ’s going to be at Cloverleigh Farms ? ”
34064	34069	34071	34071	Felicity	148	“ I think so , ”
34073	34093	34071	34071	Felicity	148	“ I just need to confirm some details with my sister Millie . She ’s the wedding planner there . ”
34094	34100	34115	34115	She	73	“ What ’s the date ? ”
34101	34114	34115	34115	She	73	“ Um , that ’s one of the details to be confirmed . ”
34120	34127	34115	34115	She	73	“ We ’re hoping for August . ”
34134	34154	34155	34155	I	441	“ So are you moving here for good , son ? Or will you two move to San Francisco ? ”
34160	34170	34155	34155	I	441	“ Plans are up in the air right now . ”
34171	34179	34181	34181	Zosia	412	“ Can I come to the wedding ? ”
34184	34187	34181	34181	Zosia	412	“ Please ? ”
34188	34194	34196	34197	my mother	412	“ Of course you can , ”
34199	34209	34210	34210	Allie	73	“ Out of curiosity , what ’s the rush ? ”
34219	34230	34210	34210	Allie	73	“ Is there anything else you want to tell us ? ”
34231	34234	34235	34235	Felicity	148	“ No , ”
34244	34255	34237	34237	I	441	“ Alexandra , the reason for the rush is obvious , ”
34268	34285	34237	34237	I	441	“ They ’re in love ! And they ’re perfect together , do n’t you agree ? ”
34295	34311	34286	34287	My sister	234	“ I agree . A bull and a crab are a match made in heaven . ”
34412	34419	34420	34420	Neil	77	“ He ’s a great guy , ”
34423	34429	34420	34420	Neil	77	“ That ’s your uncle ? ”
34430	34440	34441	34441	Felicity	148	“ He ’s married to my stepmom ’s sister , ”
34444	34463	34441	34441	Felicity	148	“ But I grew up in that family , so they ’re all aunts and uncles to me . ”
34464	34471	34473	34474	my mom	412	“ The Sawyers are wonderful people , ”
34476	34494	34441	34441	Felicity	148	“ In fact , I ca n’t wait to speak with Frannie about the wedding and everything . ”
34495	34501	34502	34502	I	441	“ Not yet , Mom , ”
34515	34536	34441	34441	Felicity	148	“ This news sort of got out unexpectedly , so give us a chance to talk to the MacAllisters first . ”
34537	34548	34549	34549	Felicity	148	“ So where can I see your next singing performance ? ”
34622	34625	34626	34626	Felicity	148	“ Jesus . ”
34634	34647	34626	34626	Felicity	148	“ That was . . . a lot . Are you okay ? ”
34648	34653	34654	34654	She	412	“ Yeah . You ? ”
34657	34686	34654	34654	She	412	“ You think they bought everything ? I feel like your parents were convinced , but sometimes your sister would look at us like she was n’t sure . ”
34687	34715	34626	34626	Felicity	148	“ Allie is pretty shrewd , but mostly I think she was just amazed I ’d kept a secret from her . I usually tell her everything . ”
34716	34733	34738	34738	she	693	“ I love that you ’re close to your sister . I think that ’s cool . ”
34741	34766	34738	34738	she	693	“ Okay , come on . Let ’s get the kitchen cleaned up and figure out how we ’re going to handle my family . ”
34824	34832	34833	34833	she	693	“ I ’ll wash , you dry ? ”
34836	34844	34845	34845	I	441	“ Sure . But — hang on . ”
34853	34857	34858	34858	She	693	“ That kiss . ”
34864	34869	34858	34858	She	693	“ What about it ? ”
34870	34881	34890	34890	She	693	“ I did n’t see a way out of it . ”
34882	34889	34890	34890	She	693	“ No . Of course not . ”
34916	34936	34913	34913	she	693	“ Is n’t it amazing that this was formed millions of years ago because of heat and intense pressure ? ”
34987	34999	34981	34981	she	693	“ I did n’t mind when you kissed me , Hutton . ”
35000	35005	35006	35006	She	693	“ You did n’t ? ”
35011	35024	35006	35006	She	693	“ At least now we know what it ’s like , right ? ”
35025	35028	35029	35029	She	693	“ Right . ”
35037	35053	35029	35029	She	693	“ In fact , we ’ll probably have to do that kind of thing again . ”
35062	35065	35029	35029	She	693	“ Kiss ? ”
35066	35083	35084	35084	She	693	“ Yeah . I mean , people are going to expect it if we ’re engaged . ”
35089	35094	35095	35095	I	441	“ Wo n’t they ? ”
35109	35120	35121	35121	Blood	134	“ So I was thinking , maybe we should practice . ”
35128	35132	35121	35121	Blood	134	“ Right now ? ”
35133	35148	35149	35149	Her	693	“ Maybe not right this second , but you know . . . soon . ”
35153	35165	35149	35149	Her	693	“ Do n’t you think it would be a good idea ? ”
35166	35175	35177	35179	a fucking caveman	695	“ Yeah . Soon . Practice . Good . ”
35181	35184	35185	35185	She	693	“ Great . ”
35196	35202	35203	35203	I	441	“ You should move in , ”
35219	35222	35210	35210	her	693	“ Huh ? ”
35223	35231	35232	35232	I	441	“ You should move in with me . ”
35240	35256	35232	35232	I	441	“ It would make things more real , more believable . Do n’t you think ? ”
35257	35271	35272	35272	Her	693	“ Um . Yes . Definitely , it would make it more real . ”
35278	35295	35272	35272	Her	693	“ It ’s just — I don’t — I did n’t know if you . . . ”
35296	35304	35232	35232	I	441	“ Did n’t know if I what ? ”
35305	35319	35320	35320	My	441	“ If you , you know , wanted to make it more real . ”
35328	35332	35333	35333	Her	693	“ I do . ”
35351	35388	35347	35347	me	441	“ Okay . I ’ll go home this afternoon and get my stuff . It will be nice to get out of my parents ’ house , even if it ’s just for a few weeks . ”
35389	35392	35393	35393	We	696	“ Great . ”
35457	35462	35463	35463	Winnie	58	“ It ’s true ? ”
35472	35475	35463	35463	Winnie	58	“ Yes . ”
35494	35512	35463	35463	Winnie	58	“ It ’s true . Hutton and I are engaged . I ’m moving in with him . ”
35513	35533	35463	35463	Winnie	58	“ I ca n’t believe it ! Why did n’t you say something yesterday ? I ’m freaking out ! ”
35534	35561	35562	35562	I	441	“ Sorry . I wanted to , but Hutton and I had agreed to keep it quiet for a while . You know how he is . ”
35601	35654	35594	35594	I	441	“ I remember him being quiet and shy , yes , but I did n’t realize you two were a thing . You always swore there was nothing there ! The words ‘ just friends ’ have come out of your mouth a million times ! You were like a broken record . ”
35655	35660	35661	35661	I	441	“ It was true , ”
35665	35694	35661	35661	I	441	“ Right up until recently . When he came back to town this summer , we realized we had feelings for each other we ’d never admitted to . ”
35695	35715	35716	35716	I	441	“ God , we are so different . I ’d have tattooed his name on my body by now . ”
35719	35722	35716	35716	I	441	“ Probably . ”
35723	35733	35735	35735	her	698	“ You know everyone saw it except you two . ”
35740	35749	35735	35735	her	698	“ Yes , well , now we do . ”
35780	35810	35774	35774	he	148	“ This is so amazing . But you know me — I’m going to need every single , solitary detail , and I ’m going to need them now . ”
35811	35844	35774	35774	he	148	“ I do n’t have time right now , but I ’ll tell you at dinner tonight . Hutton and I are hosting everyone here , and I ’m going to cook . ”
35965	35972	35973	35973	Winnie	58	“ Are Mom and Dad coming ? ”
35976	35985	35973	35973	Winnie	58	“ Yes . I just talked to Mom . ”
35986	35991	35996	35996	I	441	“ Did she cry ? ”
35992	35995	35996	35996	I	441	“ Yep , ”
36006	36048	35996	35996	I	441	“ Burst into tears the minute she answered the phone , but she ’s happy . She ’s at work and the bakery is super busy , but she made me promise to tell her everything the moment she gets here . ”
36049	36057	36058	36058	Winnie	58	“ I ca n’t wait until dinnertime , ”
36061	36069	36058	36058	Winnie	58	“ Ca n’t you tell me sooner ? ”
36070	36076	36077	36077	I	441	“ I really ca n’t , ”
36096	36121	36085	36085	Hutton	148	“ But I promise it will be worth the wait . I ’ll text you Hutton ’s address and you can come around four . ”
36126	36143	36144	36144	I	441	“ Fine . But call Mills right now , okay ? She ’s losing her mind . ”
36177	36181	36167	36167	she	2105	“ I will . ”
36182	36194	36195	36195	She	2105	“ God . You ’re getting married , Lissy . Married . ”
36200	36207	36195	36195	She	2105	“ I ca n’t believe it . ”
36208	36212	36167	36167	she	2105	“ Me neither . ”
36213	36247	36167	36167	she	2105	“ I ’m so happy for you . How awesome to fall in love with a friend . And how sweet that you two have been friends since , what , high school ? ”
36248	36252	36253	36253	I	441	“ Middle school , ”
36256	36266	36253	36253	I	441	“ He moved in the middle of seventh grade . ”
36441	36451	36452	36452	I	441	“ But we were n’t super close right away , ”
36455	36460	36461	36461	Winnie	58	“ That took time . ”
36464	36495	36461	36461	Winnie	58	“ Yes , you guys have been very good at taking your time — until now . Suddenly everything is lightning fast . Are you really getting married next month ? ”
36496	36515	36539	36541	the wedding coordinator	1716	“ Um , hopefully . I still need to talk to Millie . See if it ’s doable . ”
36516	36533	36534	36534	she	58	“ Well , if it ’s not doable at Cloverleigh , let ’s talk about Abelard , ”
36544	36586	36537	36537	Winnie	58	“ I totally understand wanting to have it at Cloverleigh Farms , but if you ca n’t get a date at such late notice , I might be able to help you out , especially if you can wait until September . ”
36587	36595	36596	36596	I	441	“ Hutton will be gone by then , ”
36601	36623	36596	36596	I	441	“ Gone ? What do you mean ? Does that mean you ’re moving too ? What about your catering business ? ”
36631	36664	36596	36596	I	441	“ Not sure of anything yet , but Hutton only has this house for about another month . Where we ’ll live is one of the decisions we ’ll have to make . ”
36665	36674	36537	36537	Winnie	58	“ I saw that your follower count exploded . ”
36675	36702	36596	36596	I	441	“ So did my DMs . Clearly getting engaged to a public figure helps your influencer status . I ’m suddenly inundated with requests to collaborate . ”
36703	36709	36596	36596	I	441	“ That ’s so exciting ! ”
36710	36725	36726	36726	I	441	“ I have a bunch of new messages in my Dearly Beloved inbox too , ”
36734	36772	36726	36726	I	441	“ I have n’t even looked at them yet . Anyway , I have to go , but I ’ll see you here at four . Feel free to bring Dex and the girls if you want . ”
36773	36784	36596	36596	I	441	“ Will all of Hutton ’s family be there too ? ”
36785	36803	36596	36596	I	441	“ No . We saw them for brunch this morning . It ’s just the MacAllisters tonight . ”
36804	36831	36833	36833	she	713	“ Pretty soon , your name wo n’t be MacAllister anymore . You ’ll be Felicity French ! If you change your name , I mean . ”
36836	36851	36833	36833	she	713	“ I ’d like to be Winnie Matthews someday . You ’re so lucky . ”
36852	36861	36862	36862	We	714	“ Thanks . I ’ll see you later . ”
37052	37056	37044	37044	She	2105	“ Running away ? ”
37072	37080	37044	37044	She	2105	“ I was going to call you . ”
37081	37086	37044	37044	She	2105	“ And say what ? ”
37087	37097	37044	37044	She	2105	“ Um , that I ’m engaged to Hutton ? ”
37110	37116	37117	37117	I	441	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
37120	37129	37130	37130	she	2105	“ You ’re not really engaged to Hutton , ”
37137	37180	37130	37130	she	2105	“ There is no way you ’ve been secretly dating him for a month . I talk to you every day . I see you all the time . I just asked you about him yesterday . Now tell me the truth . ”
37191	37200	37130	37130	she	2105	“ The truth is . . . complicated . ”
37201	37208	37130	37130	she	2105	“ Good thing I ’m smart . ”
37209	37217	37130	37130	she	2105	“ And it ’s a long story . ”
37218	37226	37227	37227	Unable	139	“ Good thing I ’ve got time . ”
37273	37280	37281	37281	I	441	“ The thing is . . . ”
37324	37372	37320	37320	I	441	“ The thing is , I opened my big mouth at the reunion last night when Mimi Pepper - Peabody - soon - to - be - Van Pelt cornered me and made me feel bad about myself , and I said I was engaged to Hutton . ”
37378	37383	37373	37373	Millie	2105	“ Oh , shit . ”
37384	37406	37373	37373	Millie	2105	“ Then I hid in a coat closet and begged him to come to the reunion and pretend it was true . ”
37407	37412	37413	37413	I	441	“ And he did ? ”
37416	37466	37413	37413	I	441	“ He showed up in a suit and tie just like I asked and stood there while I said a bunch of ridiculous things to Mimi and her fiancé about our wedding , including the fact that it ’s taking place at Cloverleigh Farms at the end of August . ”
37467	37486	37373	37373	Millie	2105	“ I know . I read about it on dirty - little - scoop - dot - com . ”
37487	37494	37495	37495	She	2105	“ You read that tabloid crap ? ”
37498	37512	37513	37513	I	441	“ I ca n’t help it . I ’m addicted to celebrity gossip . ”
37526	37575	37513	37513	I	441	“ I do n’t know how it all got out so quickly . It was just supposed to be a fun game for the night , a way to get back at Mimi for being such a twat - waffle . I told her not to say anything . ”
37576	37588	37589	37589	Millie	2105	“ Well , it ’s out there now . Somehow it — ”
37592	37610	37589	37589	Millie	2105	“ Wait , did you say Van Pelt ? Is that Mimi ’s fiancé ’s last name ? ”
37611	37620	37621	37621	I	441	“ Yeah . He has a funny name . ”
37627	37634	37621	37621	I	441	“ Thornton ! Thornton Van Pelt . ”
37635	37643	37644	37644	Millie	2105	“ That ’s how it got out , ”
37647	37688	37644	37644	Millie	2105	“ The Van Pelts own a media conglomerate — websites , cable networks , newspapers , social media , online tabloids . I bet they own Dirty Little Scoop . Basically , you told the worst possible people your secret . ”
37689	37692	37693	37693	My	441	“ Shit . ”
37706	37712	37713	37713	Millie	2105	“ I had no idea . ”
37722	37770	37713	37713	Millie	2105	“ So that explains why you ’re a viral news sensation today . But the question is , why are n’t you denying it ? Why not just say it was a joke ? Because Frannie and Dad and Winnie all think this is a real thing . ”
37771	37780	37781	37781	I	441	“ Did you tell them it was n’t ? ”
37790	37806	37807	37807	She	2105	“ No . I did n’t want to say anything until I talked to you . ”
37820	37859	37807	37807	She	2105	“ But you were ignoring all my attempts to reach out , so I had to hunt you down like a fugitive . Now what is up ? Why did n’t you tell Frannie and Dad the truth ? ”
37860	37868	37869	37869	Millie	2105	“ Because Hutton asked me not to . ”
37874	37877	37869	37869	Millie	2105	“ Why ? ”
37878	37904	37807	37807	She	2105	“ I can explain , but I want to get off the porch before I run into them . Can we go for coffee somewhere ? ”
37905	37909	37911	37911	Millie	2105	“ We can , ”
37913	37948	37911	37911	Millie	2105	“ but you might run into a lot of people pointing and whispering . This is a small town without much else to talk about , and you guys just set it on fire . ”
37949	37963	37964	37964	I	441	“ You ’re right . Okay , let ’s go to your house . ”
38122	38128	38129	38129	She	2105	“ So wait . . . ”
38135	38147	38129	38129	She	2105	“ You spent the night in separate rooms ? Nothing happened ? ”
38148	38156	38157	38157	I	441	“ Nothing happened , but . . . ”
38163	38171	38172	38172	Her	2105	“ I sort of wanted it to . ”
38177	38181	38172	38172	Her	2105	“ Keep going . ”
38182	38195	38129	38129	She	2105	“ I do n’t know , something just seems different between us . ”
38196	38205	38129	38129	She	2105	“ All summer ? Or starting last night ? ”
38206	38274	38172	38172	Her	2105	“ Maybe it ’s been all summer . It ’s hard to say — I feel close to him , which is kind of crazy since we went a long time without seeing each other . But when he moved back and we started hanging out again , it was like no time had passed at all — and also like there was some new layer there . ”
38275	38279	38280	38280	she	2105	“ Sexual tension ? ”
38299	38313	38289	38289	My	441	“ Yeah . But it ’s scary to think about crossing that line . ”
38314	38338	38339	38339	She	2105	“ That ’s understandable . You ’ve been friends for so long , it ’s harder than crossing the line with a stranger . ”
38355	38390	38347	38347	I	441	“ And what if I ’m wrong ? What if he is n’t into me that way ? What if he really was knocking on my bedroom door to ask if I was thirsty ? ”
38391	38394	38395	38395	Millie	2105	“ Wait . ”
38407	38424	38395	38395	Millie	2105	“ He knocked on your bedroom door after you guys had gone to bed last night ? ”
38425	38428	38347	38347	I	441	“ Yeah . ”
38433	38439	38347	38347	I	441	“ Without a shirt on . ”
38440	38448	38449	38449	she	2105	“ He ’s into you that way , ”
38453	38462	38463	38463	I	441	“ Also , he kissed me this morning , ”
38473	38476	38477	38477	Her	2105	“ Oh ? ”
38481	38542	38543	38543	I	441	“ It was just for show — his sister was taking pictures — but it was nice . Right after that was when he dragged me into the bedroom to say we should keep up the ruse so his mom and everyone else in town will stop bugging him about being single . He needs peace and quiet to work . ”
38551	38559	38543	38543	I	441	“ He ’s really nervous about it . ”
38560	38581	38582	38582	Millie	2105	“ I do n’t blame him . That would be scary for anyone , but especially for someone with anxiety . ”
38587	38603	38582	38582	Millie	2105	“ So the plan is to keep up the charade until he leaves for D.C. ? ”
38604	38618	38543	38543	I	441	“ I think so . We have n’t really discussed the ending yet . ”
38619	38634	38635	38635	I	441	“ But you ’re not actually going to plan a wedding , are you ? ”
38642	38656	38635	38635	I	441	“ I ’m not sure . But I am moving in with him . ”
38657	38665	38666	38666	Her	2105	“ You ’re moving in with him ? ”
38670	38696	38697	38697	She	2105	“ Yes . He suggested it this morning , to make it look more real . . . right after I suggested we practice kissing . ”
38700	38707	38697	38697	She	2105	“ This is nuts , Felicity . ”
38708	38720	38635	38635	I	441	“ But it could be kind of fun , you know ? ”
38721	38726	38697	38697	She	2105	“ Lying to everyone ? ”
38727	38772	38773	38773	I	441	“ Not that part , but — the moving in and the practice kissing and the make - believe at being in love and even the fake planning a wedding . I mean , what if I never do any of that for real ? ”
38779	38817	38773	38773	I	441	“ I ’m not like you and Winnie . I ’ve never had guys knocking down my door . I ’ve had like three boyfriends ever , and none of them lasted more than a few months . ”
38818	38835	38697	38697	She	2105	“ That ’s because you break up with anyone that says ‘ I love you . ’ ”
38836	38845	38846	38846	I	441	“ We ’re not talking about the past , ”
38850	38856	38846	38846	I	441	“ You brought it up . ”
38857	38889	38890	38890	I	441	“ What if it never happens for me , Millie ? What if it never feels right ? Why should n’t I get a chance to experience what it ’s like ? ”
38910	38919	38920	38920	Millie	2105	“ Okay , okay . I ’m sorry , ”
38924	38946	38920	38920	Millie	2105	“ As long as you ’re sure this is n’t going to end badly , I ’ll go along with it . ”
38947	38952	38953	38953	I	441	“ You have to . ”
38960	38982	38983	38983	She	441	“ You ca n’t tell anyone it ’s not real . Please . Just let us have this for a month . ”
39001	39023	38983	38983	She	441	“ I wo n’t say a word . Especially because I think it is real — part of it , anyway . ”
39024	39030	39031	39031	I	441	“ It ’s not real . ”
39045	39083	38983	38983	She	441	“ It ’s pretend and it ’s temporary and we ’re just having a good time . Now are you coming for dinner ? I ’m cooking at Hutton ’s house — I mean , our house . ”
39084	39099	38983	38983	She	441	“ I would n’t miss it . I just hope I remember my lines . ”
39100	39128	38983	38983	She	441	“ All you have to do is say you ’re going to help me plan a small wedding at the end of August . That ’s it . ”
39129	39141	39142	39142	she	441	“ Does n’t give those bangs much time to grow out , ”
39154	39158	39145	39145	I	441	“ Not funny . ”
39159	39172	39173	39173	she	441	“ It ’s actually not as bad as the photo you sent , ”
39176	39186	39173	39173	she	441	“ I ’m pretty sure you ’ve done worse . ”
39187	39190	39191	39191	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
39194	39198	39191	39191	I	441	“ I think . ”
39257	39262	39250	39250	his	729	“ Was it locked ? ”
39263	39269	39270	39270	I	441	“ I do n’t know , ”
39273	39290	39270	39270	I	441	“ But I did n’t just want to come in . I was going to knock . ”
39291	39313	39314	39314	He	729	“ Felicity , you live here now . You do n’t have to knock . I ’ll get you a key . ”
39325	39333	39314	39314	He	729	“ Can I help you with bags ? ”
39334	39339	39340	39340	I	441	“ This is it , ”
39346	39365	39366	39366	He	729	“ I did n’t pack up everything , since this is , you know , short - term . ”
39373	39382	39366	39366	He	729	“ Did you run into anyone at home ? ”
39383	39388	39389	39389	I	441	“ Yes . Millie . ”
39392	39400	39389	39389	I	441	“ And I have to confess something . ”
39401	39404	39366	39366	He	729	“ What ? ”
39405	39411	39412	39412	His	729	“ She knows the truth . ”
39416	39420	39412	39412	His	729	“ She does ? ”
39421	39464	39465	39465	I	441	“ Yes . I ’m sorry . She just knows me really well , and she can smell bullshit a mile away . I could n’t keep up the act . But do n’t worry , she ’s going along with it . ”
39468	39483	39465	39465	I	441	“ And unlike my younger sister Winnie , Millie can totally keep a secret . ”
39484	39492	39493	39493	He	729	“ Does she think we ’re crazy ? ”
39503	39509	39493	39493	He	729	“ Definitely . But she — ”
39559	39565	39555	39555	He	729	“ Is this room okay ? ”
39566	39570	39571	39571	I	441	“ Of course . ”
39578	39585	39571	39571	I	441	“ It ’s just . . . ”
39586	39589	39590	39590	He	729	“ What ? ”
39598	39636	39637	39637	He	729	“ It ’s just , what if someone asks to see the house tonight ? My family has never been here before . If they see all my stuff in a separate room , they might wonder . ”
39640	39645	39646	39646	He	729	“ You ’re right . ”
39660	39665	39646	39646	He	729	“ Is this better ? ”
39735	39742	39743	39743	He	729	“ It ’s a beautiful room . ”
39750	39799	39743	39743	He	729	“ If you just give me a minute , I ’ll clear out some drawers for you so you can unpack in here . There should be plenty of room in the closet too — it ’s huge . Sorry , I should have thought about this before . ”
39800	39807	39808	39808	He	729	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
39821	39827	39808	39808	He	729	“ Is that enough space ? ”
39828	39831	39832	39832	He	729	“ Definitely . ”
39844	39856	39832	39832	He	729	“ I ’ll just store these in another bedroom for now . ”
39857	39860	39861	39861	I	441	“ Okay . ”
39870	39876	39861	39861	I	441	“ Is that the bathroom ? ”
39877	39896	39832	39832	He	729	“ Yes . There are clean towels in there too , if you want to take a shower . ”
39897	39900	39901	39901	He	729	“ Thanks . ”
39934	39939	39940	39940	I	441	“ Would you mind ? ”
39948	39962	39940	39940	I	441	“ It ’s hard for me to get this unzipped on my own . ”
39963	39968	39969	39969	He	729	“ Oh . Sure . ”
40107	40112	40097	40097	Hutton	148	“ Is that good ? ”
40113	40119	40100	40100	his	729	“ Perfect . Thank you . ”
40120	40124	40128	40128	he	729	“ No problem . ”
40199	40207	40208	40208	Frannie	55	“ I just ca n’t believe it . ”
40268	40275	40259	40259	she	55	“ Jeez , Mom . Again ? ”
40294	40300	40288	40288	Luna	95	“ It ’s not sad . ”
40301	40309	40310	40310	Frannie	55	“ I know , but . . . ”
40323	40335	40310	40310	Frannie	55	“ It ’s overwhelming , how happy I feel about it . ”
40336	40343	40345	40346	my dad	241	“ And how sudden it was , ”
40365	40374	40354	40354	I	441	“ It was sudden . I get it . ”
40375	40387	40388	40389	gloated Winnie	58	“ But it ’s not like we did n’t all suspect , ”
40410	40421	40422	40422	she	95	“ You should have seen them back in high school , ”
40427	40441	40422	40422	she	95	“ It was obvious this was how it was going to turn out . ”
40442	40454	40455	40455	Dex	59	“ It ’s cool that you were friends for so long , ”
40458	40472	40473	40473	Winnie	58	“ So how did you go from just friends to engaged so quickly ? ”
40476	40483	40473	40473	Winnie	58	“ Like when did it happen ? ”
40527	40530	40531	40531	I	441	“ Well , ”
40549	40612	40538	40538	Hutton	148	“ you guys know we ’ve been close since we were twelve . And even when we ’d go for a while without seeing each other , we were always in touch . In March , when Hutton came home for a visit , we really reconnected . Then when he moved back in May , we started spending more time together . ”
40613	40623	40624	40624	Winnie	58	“ So it really was n’t sudden at all , ”
40630	40643	40644	40644	Frannie	55	“ You realized what you ’d been looking for was right there , ”
40652	40659	40660	40660	Audrey	57	“ Just like in a song , ”
40663	40668	40660	40660	Audrey	57	“ Or a movie . ”
40669	40674	40676	40676	Hallie	96	“ Or a storybook , ”
40678	40698	40676	40676	Hallie	96	“ Except not a fairy tale , because Felicity was n’t , like , a servant or a mermaid . ”
40699	40707	40709	40709	Luna	95	“ Or in a sleep like death , ”
40711	40718	40676	40676	Hallie	96	“ Or stuck in a tower . ”
40719	40744	40745	40747	The two girls	274	“ Good thing , because she just chopped all her hair off . There would n’t have been anything for a prince to climb . ”
40760	40770	40771	40771	Dex	59	“ At least you got to be a prince , ”
40776	40790	40771	40771	Dex	59	“ When they put me in a story , I ’m an ogre . ”
40791	40801	40803	40803	Audrey	57	“ Are you going to have a big wedding ? ”
40805	40808	40809	40809	I	441	“ No , ”
40813	40834	40835	40835	I	441	“ We ’d like something very intimate at Cloverleigh Farms . Millie and I are working together on a date . ”
40849	40852	40853	40853	she	228	“ Yes , ”
40856	40863	40853	40853	she	228	“ We ’ll work it out . ”
40864	40875	40876	40876	Frannie	55	“ But Cloverleigh must be totally booked for the season , ”
40881	40893	40894	40894	Millie	2105	“ On weekends , the barn is booked up , yes , ”
40897	40918	40894	40894	Millie	2105	“ But since their event is small , we might be able to accommodate them somewhere else on the property . ”
40919	40933	40934	40934	Frannie	55	“ We could close down the bar and restaurant on a Sunday evening , ”
40937	40947	40934	40934	Frannie	55	“ We ’ve done that for private events before . ”
40948	40951	40953	40954	my dad	241	“ Sure , ”
40956	40968	40969	40969	I	441	“ We know this is last minute , and we apologize , ”
40975	40979	40969	40969	I	441	“ No need . ”
41024	41036	41037	41037	I	441	“ We ’ll make it work . Nothing is more important . ”
41041	41048	41049	41049	Winnie	58	“ Tell us about the proposal , ”
41052	41058	41049	41049	Winnie	58	“ It was very romantic . ”
41069	41089	41049	41049	Winnie	58	“ We were on a walk in the woods here , and he suddenly just dropped to one knee . ”
41090	41097	41098	41098	Frannie	55	“ Had you been planning it ? ”
41102	41109	41098	41098	Frannie	55	“ It was sort of spontaneous . ”
41131	41138	41122	41122	I	441	“ Did he have a ring ? ”
41144	41159	41160	41160	I	441	“ No , but we looked at photos online , and chose one together , ”
41163	41176	41160	41160	I	441	“ It ’s being sized and we ’ll pick it up soon . ”
41177	41189	41190	41190	Winnie	58	“ So you ’ve never even had it on your finger ? ”
41196	41212	41213	41213	I	441	“ It will be like getting engaged all over again when you put it on ! ”
41216	41222	41213	41213	I	441	“ I guess it will . ”
41223	41228	41229	41229	Frannie	55	“ Which jewelry store ? ”
41232	41239	41240	41240	Panic	145	“ Is it one in town ? ”
41253	41256	41257	41257	Hutton	148	“ Tiffany . ”
41263	41285	41257	41257	Hutton	148	“ It ’s at Tiffany in New York . We ’re going to fly there this week and pick it up . ”
41286	41290	41291	41291	Winnie	58	“ You are ? ”
41294	41298	41299	41299	I	441	“ We are ? ”
41304	41307	41308	41308	He	148	“ Yes . ”
41320	41323	41308	41308	He	148	“ Surprise . ”
41324	41327	41328	41328	Frannie	55	“ Oh . ”
41333	41339	41328	41328	Frannie	55	“ Here I go again . ”
41442	41460	41436	41436	I	441	“ I ’m just going to get the dishes loaded , and then I ’ll come down . ”
41461	41475	41476	41476	She	2105	“ I ’ll help you . I want to talk to you anyway . ”
41490	41499	41476	41476	She	2105	“ Oh my God ! I ’m dying ! ”
41516	41525	41476	41476	She	2105	“ Do you think we pulled it off ? ”
41526	41559	41476	41476	She	2105	“ Definitely . Everyone was so excited because you guys have been friends for so long . I do n’t think they questioned it a bit — they want to believe it . ”
41560	41563	41564	41564	I	441	“ Good . ”
41571	41587	41564	41564	I	441	“ Although I do feel kind of bad about how happy Dad and Frannie are . ”
41588	41598	41599	41599	She	441	“ They are happy . But you know what ? ”
41617	41623	41599	41599	She	441	“ Hutton is happy too . ”
41624	41630	41564	41564	I	441	“ What do you mean ? ”
41631	41646	41647	41647	I	441	“ I mean he does not look at you like the feelings are fake . ”
41657	41669	41647	41647	I	441	“ They are n’t all fake . We ’re good friends . ”
41670	41677	41599	41599	She	441	“ You know what I mean . ”
41678	41686	41687	41687	I	441	“ How does he look at me ? ”
41693	41703	41704	41704	I	441	“ Like he ca n’t believe you ’re real . ”
41710	41714	41704	41704	I	441	“ Stop it . ”
41715	41759	41599	41599	She	441	“ I ’m serious . The guy has a thing for you . Why else would he agree to this crazy scheme ? Ask you to move in ? Fly you to Tiffany in New York next week to pick up a ring ? ”
41760	41770	41771	41771	I	441	“ I have no idea what that was about , ”
41775	41788	41771	41771	I	441	“ It was not part of the story we made up earlier . ”
41789	41795	41796	41796	She	441	“ That ’s my point . ”
41807	41816	41796	41796	She	441	“ Not all of this is made up . ”
41817	41832	41833	41833	I	441	“ Okay , maybe not all of it — there is an attraction there , ”
41857	41870	41845	41845	her	441	“ Speaking of which , what are the sleeping arrangements Chez French ? ”
41875	41939	41845	41845	her	441	“ I ’m not sure . At first , he put all my stuff in the guest room , but then we thought that would look suspicious , so we moved it into his bedroom . But I do n’t know what ’s going to happen tonight . Like , when it ’s time for bed , which room should I go in ? ”
41940	41949	41845	41845	her	441	“ Do you want to sleep with him ? ”
41950	41973	41974	41974	Millie	2105	“ Yes , but you ’re not supposed to want to bang your best friend or your fake fiancé , are you ? ”
41977	42004	42005	42005	She	2105	“ I do n’t think there are any guidelines for this situation . You ’re going to have to make them up as you go along . ”
42012	42016	42005	42005	She	2105	“ Have fun . ”
42032	42038	42017	42019	EIGHT HUTTON Felicity	148	“ So was it terrible ? ”
42039	42070	42071	42071	She	2105	“ No . It was n’t terrible . Actually , your family talks so much that I did n’t really feel pressured to be on once we got through dinner . ”
42074	42095	42071	42071	She	2105	“ We do talk a lot . And adding Dex ’s girls to the mix was another layer of chaos . ”
42096	42111	42017	42019	EIGHT HUTTON Felicity	148	“ It was fine . I ’m fucking exhausted , but it was fine . ”
42112	42121	42122	42122	she	2105	“ Why do n’t you go to bed ? ”
42125	42132	42122	42122	she	2105	“ I can finish cleaning up . ”
42133	42140	42141	42141	I	441	“ I ’m not physically exhausted , ”
42152	42202	42203	42203	She	2105	“ It ’s just a lot of work for me to be around a group of people , even people I like . Takes a lot of energy beneath the surface to appear cool and collected on the outside when your insides feel like a bunch of live wires . ”
42206	42218	42203	42203	She	2105	“ I bet . Thank you for doing that for me . ”
42219	42250	42122	42122	she	2105	“ You ’re welcome . And you do n’t have to clean up . The housekeeper will be here in the morning , and she can take care of it . ”
42251	42268	42269	42269	she	2105	“ I ’m just going to finish loading the dishwasher and take care of the pans , ”
42277	42290	42269	42269	she	2105	“ I ’ve worked in too many restaurants to leave a mess . ”
42291	42296	42203	42203	She	2105	“ Can I help ? ”
42297	42334	42335	42335	I	441	“ No . But you can keep me company and you can say it ’s okay to shoot some photos for my blog in here tomorrow . The light and surfaces are going to look amazing ! ”
42338	42352	42353	42353	Her	2105	“ Of course it ’s okay . This is your kitchen now too . ”
42359	42363	42364	42364	I	441	“ Thank you . ”
42371	42387	42364	42364	I	441	“ So tell me more about your business plans . What ’s the ultimate goal ? ”
42429	42460	42461	42461	she	2105	“ I love the combination of art and science that cooking takes , and I love the stories behind the places where ingredients come from — especially fruits and vegetables , ”
42466	42543	42461	42461	she	2105	“ I know it ’s not super sexy , but I think growing up running around Cloverleigh Farms really showed me the love and pride and passion families have for growing good things . And there are all kinds of small farms like that , passing down family traditions and recipes and methods . I ’m fascinated by the human side of it . That ’s what I missed in the test kitchen . The stories . ”
42696	42708	42709	42709	she	2105	“ I guess my ultimate goal would be to write cookbooks , ”
42712	42764	42709	42709	she	2105	“ But I need to build a platform first in order for publishing houses to consider me . Unless you ’re already a celebrity , it ’s not easy to get a cookbook deal . You need something to make you stand out , a unique perspective , a fresh aesthetic . ”
42765	42782	42783	42783	She	2105	“ I know some people in publishing . I could put you in touch with them . ”
42788	42870	42783	42783	She	2105	“ Thanks , but I want to do it on my own . I had this all planned out when I moved back . Frannie sat down with me , and we sort of mapped out the steps I should take . First , get my blog up and running . Next , start my catering business . Then , once I had traction and a bigger following — and some income — I could write the proposal for the book . ”
42871	42876	42783	42783	She	2105	“ That makes sense . ”
42877	42888	42889	42889	She	2105	“ I ’m still finding my voice , you know ? ”
42908	42930	42889	42889	She	2105	“ I ’m still building confidence in myself and figuring out what I want to say and why people should listen . ”
42931	42938	42939	42939	I	441	“ I have faith in you , ”
42943	42958	42939	42939	I	441	“ You ’re smart and creative and intuitive . You ’ll find the angle . ”
42959	42962	42963	42963	Her	2105	“ Thanks . ”
42968	42994	42963	42963	Her	2105	“ I remember when I wanted to drop out of Brown and go to culinary school . Everyone told me I was crazy except you . ”
42995	43006	42939	42939	I	441	“ I wanted you to do what makes you happy . ”
43007	43039	43040	43040	She	2105	“ I know . I appreciated that . Most people just brought up the money — didn’t I realize I ’d never make a doctor ’s salary working in a restaurant ? ”
43052	43058	43040	43040	She	2105	“ Money is n’t everything . ”
43059	43063	43064	43064	She	2105	“ I agree . ”
43072	43084	43064	43064	She	2105	“ Um , that thing you said . About New York ? ”
43085	43090	43091	43091	I	441	“ Sorry about that . ”
43094	43115	43091	43091	I	441	“ As soon as it was out of my mouth , I realized I probably should have asked you first . ”
43116	43119	43120	43120	She	2105	“ Hutton . ”
43127	43149	43120	43120	She	2105	“ Stop apologizing to me . You never have to worry that I ’ll take things like that the wrong way . ”
43150	43159	43167	43167	she	2105	“ Does that mean you want to go ? ”
43174	43180	43167	43167	she	2105	“ Of course I do ! ”
43193	43207	43182	43182	she	2105	“ But not to buy a ring , right ? Just for fun . ”
43208	43224	43167	43167	she	2105	“ Do n’t you think we should get you a ring ? Everyone keeps asking . ”
43225	43239	43240	43240	She	2105	“ Okay , but not a Tiffany ring . Something fake and cheap . ”
43255	43266	43240	43240	She	2105	“ I mean it , Hutton . No expensive ring . ”
43267	43271	43167	43167	she	2105	“ Why not ? ”
43272	43301	43302	43302	She	2105	“ Because it ’s unnecessary . Let ’s just buy a decoy , okay ? An imitation diamond for our imitation engagement . That ’s all we need . ”
43307	43314	43302	43302	She	2105	“ Do n’t waste your money . ”
43348	43351	43352	43352	She	2105	“ Okay . ”
43356	43360	43352	43352	She	2105	“ Thank you . ”
43361	43370	43304	43304	her	2105	“ Does the trip work with your schedule ? ”
43371	43432	43352	43352	She	2105	“ Well , I ’m on the schedule at Etoile Tuesday through Thursday , but not in the kitchen . I have to man the booth at the Cherry Festival . And I ’d say I could get someone to cover for me , but there ’s something kind of crazy going down Tuesday night that I ca n’t miss . ”
43433	43438	43352	43352	She	2105	“ What is it ? ”
43447	43487	43488	43488	I	441	“ It ’s a proposal . Etoile ’s head chef , Gianni , is going to propose to his girlfriend , Ellie Fournier . She ’s the daughter of the Abelard owners . But you ca n’t tell anyone . ”
43491	43497	43488	43488	I	441	“ Who would I tell ? ”
43498	43549	43550	43550	She	441	“ Anyway , I ca n’t miss it . I think I ’m the only other person that knows what ’s going to happen and when , and I promised Gianni I ’d be there to make sure Ellie is where she ’s supposed to be at the right time . ”
43556	43573	43550	43550	She	441	“ But I might be able to get someone to cover for me Wednesday and Thursday . ”
43574	43582	43488	43488	I	441	“ Okay . You let me know . ”
43583	43607	43550	43550	She	441	“ I ’ll ask Gianni tomorrow , but it will be kind of short notice to plan a trip , wo n’t it ? ”
43608	43626	43550	43550	She	441	“ It ’s not a problem . I ’ll get us there and back whenever we want . ”
43627	43637	43488	43488	I	441	“ Do you own a private jet or something ? ”
43638	43652	43653	43653	She	441	“ No private jet . But it ’s easy enough to hire one . ”
43656	43663	43653	43653	She	441	“ Spoken like a true billionaire . ”
43689	43694	43676	43676	She	441	“ Ready for bed ? ”
43695	43698	43699	43699	I	441	“ Yes . ”
43703	43731	43699	43699	I	441	“ Go ahead . I ’m just going to make sure all the lights are off downstairs and the doors are locked before turning the alarm on . ”
43732	43736	43676	43676	She	441	“ Need help ? ”
43737	43744	43745	43745	My	441	“ No . I ’m good . ”
44228	44231	44232	44232	she	441	“ Hi , ”
44235	44238	44232	44232	she	441	“ Hey . ”
44239	44250	44251	44251	My	441	“ I was wondering if you wanted to practice now . ”
44264	44270	44251	44251	My	441	“ Yeah . I do . ”
44271	44279	44232	44232	she	441	“ Should I get in your bed ? ”
44280	44283	44284	44284	She	441	“ Definitely . ”
44353	44357	44343	44343	I	441	“ Come here . ”
44404	44407	44408	44408	she	441	“ Oh , ”
44411	44416	44408	44408	she	441	“ Is this okay ? ”
44429	44436	44417	44417	She	441	“ It ’s more than okay . ”
44623	44632	44633	44633	I	441	“ Maybe we should discuss a few things , ”
44643	44647	44633	44633	I	441	“ Like what ? ”
44648	44660	44668	44668	I	441	“ Like what other things we should practice . For example . ”
44684	44693	44694	44694	She	441	“ I could practice touching you like this . ”
44763	44773	44742	44742	She	441	“ And I could practice touching you like this . ”
44831	44838	44823	44823	I	441	“ I could practice undressing you . ”
44839	44846	44847	44847	she	441	“ I definitely think you should , ”
44995	44999	44986	44986	She	441	“ My turn . ”
45165	45168	45169	45169	she	441	“ Hutton , ”
45175	45184	45169	45169	she	441	“ You should practice taking off my underwear . ”
45223	45229	45214	45214	She	441	“ What are you doing ? ”
45230	45235	45236	45236	I	441	“ Is this okay ? ”
45251	45255	45256	45256	She	441	“ I guess . ”
45260	45272	45256	45256	She	441	“ You can tell me to stop , and I will . ”
45307	45312	45313	45313	she	441	“ Do n’t stop , ”
45326	45330	45313	45313	she	441	“ Never stop . ”
45331	45340	45313	45313	she	441	“ You taste even better than I imagined . ”
45341	45347	45348	45348	Her	441	“ You ’ve imagined this ? ”
45354	45358	45359	45359	I	441	“ Oh yeah . ”
45389	45402	45359	45359	I	441	“ I ’ve played this movie in my mind a thousand times . ”
45403	45406	45407	45407	She	441	“ You — ”
45412	45418	45419	45419	I	441	“ You never said anything . ”
45442	45453	45436	45436	Her	441	“ Not the thing you tell someone during calculus review . ”
45459	45465	45466	45466	I	441	“ Or in a text . ”
45482	45490	45491	45491	She	441	“ Or at the hospital emergency room . ”
45494	45504	45505	45505	I	441	“ God , do n’t remind me about that . ”
45514	45529	45505	45505	I	441	“ It all worked out . I ’m exactly where I want to be . ”
45530	45534	45535	45535	she	441	“ Me too , ”
45545	45556	45535	45535	she	441	“ I ’m exactly where I want to be too . ”
45600	45617	45622	45622	she	441	“ Your tongue — oh God — you’re amazing . I can’t — I ca n’t — ”
45688	45694	45695	45695	she	441	“ It ’s too much , ”
45698	45704	45695	45695	she	441	“ You have to stop . ”
45725	45730	45695	45695	she	441	“ I can stop . ”
45731	45750	45751	45751	She	441	“ I do n’t mean stop forever , just maybe for a second , so I can breathe . ”
45759	45767	45751	45751	She	441	“ But practice is n’t over yet . ”
45768	45771	45772	45772	She	441	“ No ? ”
45777	45790	45772	45772	She	441	“ I think there are several more things we should work on . ”
45791	45798	45751	45751	She	441	“ I ’m open to suggestions . ”
45799	45808	45809	45809	I	441	“ I thought you enjoyed being in control . ”
45812	45817	45809	45809	I	441	“ That ’s true . ”
45818	45824	45825	45825	she	441	“ I ’m not scared , ”
45828	45839	45825	45825	she	441	“ I trust you . Tell me what you like . ”
45874	45879	45880	45880	I	441	“ Do n’t move . ”
45905	45908	45909	45909	She	441	“ Wait . ”
45913	45922	45909	45909	She	441	“ I think I should practice this part . ”
46012	46018	45997	45997	she	441	“ How did I do ? ”
46019	46024	45997	45997	she	441	“ A perfect ten . ”
46038	46050	46029	46029	her	441	“ But this next part is critical . Timing is everything . ”
46051	46057	46058	46058	she	441	“ Could not agree more , ”
46114	46121	46106	46106	I	441	“ You feel so fucking good . ”
46122	46125	46126	46126	she	441	“ Hutton , ”
46144	46151	46126	46126	she	441	“ This ca n’t be real . ”
46548	46556	46537	46537	she	441	“ That was . . . wow . ”
46557	46572	46537	46537	she	441	“ Yeah . We probably got in a little more practice than we needed . ”
46573	46588	46537	46537	she	441	“ No , I think it was good . Practice makes perfect , right ? ”
46589	46598	46599	46599	Her	441	“ That was pretty fucking close to perfect . ”
46641	46653	46654	46654	Her	441	“ I was n’t sure if I should come in here . ”
46662	46665	46654	46654	Her	441	“ Seriously ? ”
46692	46712	46679	46679	I	441	“ Yeah . I could not make up my mind about whether you wanted me like this or not . ”
46713	46717	46718	46718	She	441	“ Convinced now ? ”
46721	46724	46718	46718	She	441	“ Mmhm . ”
46725	46728	46729	46729	I	441	“ Good . ”
46734	46793	46794	46794	I	441	“ I even came in here while you were downstairs turning off the lights to steal a shirt . That was going to be my excuse if you caught me in your bedroom , and then I was going to attempt to seduce you . But you took so long coming back up that I lost my nerve . ”
46804	46858	46859	46859	She	788	“ Sorry . I was trying to give you enough time to make the choice on your own about which bedroom to sleep in . I was hoping you ’d choose mine , but I did n’t want to pressure you . But please tell me you ’ll attempt to seduce me again . ”
46862	46873	46859	46859	She	788	“ Maybe . You ’ll have to wait and see . ”
46874	46887	46859	46859	She	788	“ This is definitely a side of you I ’ve never seen . ”
46888	46911	46912	46912	Her	788	“ There ’s a reason for that . We ’ve always been such good friends . I mean , we still are . ”
46919	46922	46912	46912	Her	788	“ Right ? ”
46923	46929	46930	46930	I	441	“ Of course we are . ”
46938	46952	46930	46930	I	441	“ In fact , I ’m really glad to hear you say that . ”
46953	46956	46912	46912	Her	788	“ Why ? ”
46957	46965	46930	46930	I	441	“ I ca n’t promise anything more . ”
46966	46973	46930	46930	I	441	“ Because you suck at relationships ? ”
46974	46977	46978	46978	I	441	“ Hey . ”
46990	46996	46997	46997	she	788	“ Sorry — couldn’t resist , ”
47000	47025	46997	46997	she	788	“ But do n’t worry , I ca n’t promise anything more either . To be perfectly honest , I suck at relationships too . ”
47026	47033	46930	46930	I	441	“ I do n’t believe that . ”
47034	47074	46997	46997	she	788	“ Believe it . I mean , I ’ve never dated a Zlatka , so no one has ever told me that to my face , but my sister Millie said something today that hit pretty close to home . ”
47075	47081	47082	47082	Felicity	148	“ What did she say ? ”
47090	47120	47082	47082	Felicity	148	“ She said the reason I ’ve never had a successful long - term relationship is because I break up with anyone who says ‘ I love you . ’ ”
47121	47126	46997	46997	she	788	“ Is that true ? ”
47127	47132	47133	47133	I	441	“ One hundred percent . ”
47148	47154	47155	47155	She	441	“ And why is that ? ”
47162	47201	47155	47155	She	441	“ I do n’t really know . I ’ve just always been that way . I suppose I figure things are going to blow up at some point anyway , so I might as well light the match . ”
47282	47293	47294	47294	I	441	“ Well , I think Zlatka is into women too , ”
47298	47358	47294	47294	I	441	“ so if you ’d like to date her , I ’m sure she ’d be glad to tell you exactly why you suck at relationships . Although , she ’s not likely to tell you she loves you — at least , she never said that to me — so maybe things would work out with you guys . ”
47366	47385	47361	47361	she	234	“ No , thanks . I do n’t need Zlatka in my life pointing out all my flaws . ”
47386	47392	47361	47361	she	234	“ You have no flaws . ”
47393	47414	47361	47361	she	234	“ Ha ! I ’ve got plenty . But I ’m actually sort of glad for one of them tonight . ”
47415	47419	47361	47361	she	234	“ Oh yeah ? ”
47420	47456	47457	47457	My	441	“ Yes , if I had better impulse control , I might not have told Mimi we were engaged , and then I would not have just experienced the best two orgasms of my life . ”
47470	47482	47464	47464	She	234	“ Tell me something about yourself that I do n’t know . ”
47483	47487	47361	47361	she	234	“ Like what ? ”
47488	47495	47496	47496	I	441	“ Something from before we met . ”
47502	47518	47496	47496	I	441	“ When I was a kid , I wanted to be a professional baseball player . ”
47519	47532	47464	47464	She	234	“ You did ? I did n’t even know you played baseball . ”
47533	47543	47464	47464	She	234	“ I quit right before we moved up here . ”
47544	47547	47496	47496	I	441	“ Why ? ”
47548	47571	47464	47464	She	234	“ I had a really bad game . Struck out three times in a row and cost my team the league championship . ”
47588	47591	47592	47592	Felicity	148	“ Oh . ”
47597	47608	47592	47592	Felicity	148	“ I ’m sorry . That had to feel terrible . ”
47609	47642	47464	47464	She	234	“ It did . I never played again . But it ’s not like I was going to play professionally anyway . I was talented , but I was n’t that good . ”
47643	47665	47592	47592	Felicity	148	“ Well , I ’m glad you told me . The childhood baseball dream seems like something a fiancée would know . ”
47666	47679	47592	47592	Felicity	148	“ What did you want to be when you were a kid ? ”
47680	47715	47592	47592	Felicity	148	“ A hundred different things . A scientist . An astronaut . A pastry chef . A school librarian . I thought it would be cool to spend my days around kids and books . ”
47716	47727	47592	47592	Felicity	148	“ You ’d be great at that , Miss MacAllister . ”
47738	47746	47747	47747	She	797	“ Would you be a naughty librarian ? ”
47750	47766	47767	47767	I	441	“ Only for you . Hey , this is what we should do every night . ”
47782	47789	47767	47767	I	441	“ I could not agree more . ”
47790	47797	47798	47798	she	797	“ I do n’t mean that , ”
47803	47839	47798	47798	she	797	“ I mean — yes , that too — but what I meant was that every night we should tell each other one secret . So that we know each other better than anybody else . ”
47840	47850	47767	47767	I	441	“ You already know me better than anybody else . ”
47851	47855	47856	47856	she	797	“ I do ? ”
47863	47868	47856	47856	she	797	“ Are you surprised ? ”
47869	47899	47767	47767	I	441	“ Kind of . I mean , I know we ’re close now , and we were close then , but there were a lot of years in between . ”
47924	47943	47944	47944	She	797	“ Does n’t matter . I ’ve never been close with anyone the way I am with you . ”
47952	47967	47944	47944	She	797	“ Are you saying that right now because you want to have more sex ? ”
47968	47971	47972	47972	I	441	“ Yes . ”
47977	48012	47972	47972	I	441	“ But I also mean it . What looks like a six to you might appear as a nine to me . It ’s just a different perspective . Both things can be true . ”
48013	48021	48022	48022	she	797	“ You ’re such a math nerd , ”
48025	48035	48036	48036	She	797	“ I also like the numbers six and nine . ”
48047	48056	48036	48036	She	797	“ I suppose both things can be true . ”
48342	48345	48334	48334	Hutton	148	“ Hey . ”
48346	48349	48350	48350	I	441	“ Hi . ”
48364	48368	48350	48350	I	441	“ Heading out ? ”
48369	48378	48379	48379	I	441	“ Yeah . Want to come with me ? ”
48420	48436	48404	48404	I	441	“ Nah , you go ahead . I might take a jog later or something . ”
48437	48440	48441	48441	He	148	“ Okay . ”
48452	48491	48492	48492	I	441	“ The housekeeper will be here in about an hour . I texted her that I had a guest staying with me , so she would n’t be caught off guard by the naked girl in my bed . ”
48495	48515	48492	48492	I	441	“ Thanks , but I ’m getting up in a minute here . I need to go into work . ”
48516	48524	48404	48404	I	441	“ Is n’t the restaurant closed Mondays ? ”
48525	48584	48492	48492	I	441	“ Yes , but I have to check in with Gianni — I want to go over details for tomorrow night ’s proposal and ask him about getting Wednesday or Thursday off . After that , I was thinking of making a few dishes and taking some photos in your kitchen . Will you be around for dinner ? ”
48585	48593	48492	48492	I	441	“ You ’re cooking ? Fuck yes . ”
48594	48597	48598	48598	I	441	“ Great . ”
48601	48620	48598	48598	I	441	“ Say hi to the Prancin ’ Grannies for me . Will they be heartbroken about your engagement ? ”
48621	48636	48492	48492	I	441	“ Probably . But maybe they ’ll stop bugging me about their granddaughters now . ”
48637	48641	48642	48642	He	148	“ Good luck . ”
48808	48816	48817	48817	I	441	“ Good morning , future Mrs. French . ”
48820	48826	48817	48817	I	441	“ Morning . You busy ? ”
48827	48836	48837	48837	She	58	“ Not too bad . Come on in . ”
48846	48860	48837	48837	She	58	“ What ’s up ? You ’re not working today , are you ? ”
48861	48865	48866	48866	Etoile	149	“ Not officially . ”
48873	48889	48866	48866	Etoile	149	“ But I need to check with Gianni on a couple things for this week . ”
48926	48946	48913	48913	Gianni	150	“ Like taking some days off to go to New York on a shopping spree with your billionaire boyfriend ? ”
48947	48955	48956	48956	I	441	“ It ’s not a shopping spree , ”
48963	48972	48956	48956	I	441	“ We ’re just picking up the ring . ”
48973	48979	48980	48980	She	58	“ Where will you stay ? ”
48991	49001	48980	48980	She	58	“ The Ritz ? The Carlyle ? The Pierre ? ”
49002	49008	49009	49009	I	441	“ I ’m not sure , ”
49019	49031	49032	49032	Her	58	“ But we ’re chartering a private jet to fly there . ”
49036	49048	49032	49032	Her	58	“ Stop it ! Are n’t you high - falutin ’ ? ”
49049	49066	48980	48980	She	58	“ Listen , Hutton works hard . He ’s earned the right to falute a little . ”
49067	49107	49110	49110	I	441	“ I agree one hundred percent , and I look forward to faluting vicariously through you . But hey , if you stay at The Pierre , steal one of the bathroom robes for me . They ’re glorious . ”
49115	49143	49110	49110	I	441	“ I will not be stealing any bathrobes . Anyway , I wanted to make sure you can still help out in the Etoile booth tomorrow night . ”
49144	49156	49032	49032	Her	58	“ Yes . I ’ll be there . Six , right ? ”
49157	49189	49190	49190	I	441	“ Perfect . The second thing is , I wondered if you might help me sift through some of these messages I ’m getting from companies wanting to collaborate with me . ”
49209	49253	49190	49190	I	441	“ My follower count and inbox have gone bananas , I have no idea if any of these people are legit , and it feels kind of icky that all I did was get engaged to Hutton and now I ’m insanely popular . ”
49254	49263	49264	49264	She	805	“ I ’d be glad to help you . ”
49275	49295	49264	49264	She	805	“ But you do n’t have to say yes to any of them if you do n’t want to . ”
49296	49353	49354	49354	She	805	“ Half the companies reaching out to me have nothing to do with food . It ’s like clothes or cosmetics or hair products . Can you imagine ? Me , recommending hair products ? I ’m even fielding requests regarding my wedding day . Someone wants to send me a case of self - tanner ! ”
49357	49362	49354	49354	She	805	“ So say no . ”
49363	49387	49264	49264	She	805	“ But is that stupid ? What if it helps my business ? I wo n’t get a book deal without a platform . ”
49388	49477	49478	49478	I	441	“ I get that . But ideally , you want to build an audience of people who would be interested in what you do , what you say , and who ’d eventually buy your book . Recommending a self - tanner might earn you a little extra cash , but it probably wo n’t build your audience . A better use of your time would probably be concentrating on putting out more content . And it ’s not like you need the extra cash for rent anymore . ”
49484	49496	49478	49478	I	441	“ Right . I am going to put out more content . ”
49497	49529	49558	49558	Etoile	149	“ Good . So if it does n’t feel right to say yes to those offers , do n’t . But of course I can help you sort through it all . ”
49530	49549	49550	49550	I	441	“ Thanks . I ’m going to head over to see Gianni and then I ’ll be back . ”
49570	49573	49574	49574	I	441	“ Morning , ”
49577	49580	49581	49581	He	150	“ Morning . ”
49588	49597	49581	49581	He	150	“ Coffee ’s hot if you want some . ”
49598	49601	49602	49602	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
49608	49615	49602	49602	I	441	“ All set for tomorrow night ? ”
49616	49621	49622	49622	He	150	“ I think so . ”
49631	49643	49644	49644	I	441	“ She ’s going to be so fucking mad at me . ”
49647	49654	49655	49655	Ellie	234	“ She ’ll still say yes . ”
49727	49736	49737	49737	he	150	“ Just do n’t forget the final prop , ”
49740	49760	49737	49737	he	150	“ Once she ’s wearing the ring , I need to throw a whipped cream pie in her face . ”
49769	49782	49737	49737	he	150	“ I really can not wait to see this proposal go down . ”
49783	49788	49789	49789	He	150	“ Speaking of proposals . ”
49794	49813	49789	49789	He	150	“ What ’s this I hear about you being secretly engaged ? Ellie was losing her mind yesterday . ”
49814	49819	49820	49820	My	441	“ Oh . Yeah . ”
49833	49836	49826	49826	I	441	“ Surprise . ”
49837	49852	49789	49789	He	150	“ I ca n’t believe you never said anything . When ’s the wedding ? ”
49853	49862	49863	49863	Gianni	150	“ Um , we ’re thinking next month . ”
49869	49876	49877	49877	He	150	“ Wow . That ’s fast . ”
49883	49889	49877	49877	He	150	“ Is there a reason ? ”
49890	49897	49898	49898	I	441	“ Not that kind of reason , ”
49902	49917	49898	49898	I	441	“ We just . . . do n’t want to wait , I guess . ”
49918	49930	49931	49931	he	150	“ Do n’t let anybody make you feel bad about that , ”
49941	50014	49931	49931	he	150	“ People always think they know how everyone else should live their lives and make their choices , because that ’s the way they did it . But it ’s bullshit . There ’s no one right way to do things — it ’s all right in the end , as long as it gets you where you want to go . The journey looks different for everybody , and it should . ”
50015	50018	50019	50019	I	441	“ Thanks , ”
50037	50042	49931	49931	he	150	“ I appreciate that . ”
50043	50068	49931	49931	he	150	“ And Ellie mentioned you guys have been good friends for a lot of years , so maybe it was n’t that sudden anyway . ”
50069	50076	50077	50077	I	441	“ It was slow and sudden . ”
50080	50087	50077	50077	I	441	“ Both things can be true . ”
50173	50184	50161	50161	Winnie	58	“ You think so ? That ’s what Millie said . ”
50185	50189	50190	50190	she	58	“ I would , ”
50196	50240	50190	50190	she	58	“ Show potential clients that you honestly care . Because the biggest priority is getting more reviews , and to get those , you need more business . I think you could do it in a way that shows your professionalism and character . ”
50291	50294	50296	50296	Winnie	58	“ Perfect , ”
50298	50303	50304	50304	I	441	“ I should go , ”
50311	50344	50304	50304	I	441	“ I need to hit the market on my way home . I want to try a few new recipes and take some photos while the light is good in the kitchen . ”
50345	50357	50358	50358	Winnie	58	“ Let me know when those companies get back to you , ”
50366	50375	50376	50376	I	441	“ I think you made the right choices . ”
50384	50390	50376	50376	I	441	“ Thanks for the help . ”
50391	50397	50398	50398	she	58	“ So I was wondering , ”
50408	50424	50398	50398	she	58	“ do you have plans for the last Saturday evening in July ? The 30th ? ”
50450	50460	50443	50443	she	58	“ Not that I ’m aware of . Why ? ”
50461	50468	50469	50469	she	58	“ No reason . No reason , ”
50516	50524	50525	50525	She	58	“ Winnie . Do you know something ? ”
50545	50561	50535	50535	her	58	“ For heaven ’s sake , Win . You know something . Out with it . ”
50562	50571	50572	50572	she	58	“ But I promised I would n’t telllllll , ”
50581	50591	50592	50592	She	58	“ You know you ca n’t keep a secret . ”
50609	50612	50613	50613	She	58	“ Winifred . ”
50629	50636	50637	50637	Her	58	“ Fine . I ’m leaving . ”
50645	50663	50637	50637	Her	58	“ If I tell you , you have to promise me that you wo n’t say anything . ”
50664	50667	50668	50668	She	58	“ Okay . ”
50676	50695	50696	50696	I	441	“ So while you were in the kitchen , I got a phone call from Hutton ’s mom . ”
50706	50709	50696	50696	I	441	“ And ? ”
50710	50728	50729	50729	I	441	“ She wants to plan a surprise outdoor engagement party for you guys here on the patio . ”
50732	50739	50729	50729	I	441	“ Shoot ! On the 30th ? ”
50740	50782	50696	50696	I	441	“ Yes . The crazy thing was , that date was booked right up until this morning ! Literally , the event that was scheduled got canceled like ten minutes before she called . It was some kind of weird kismet . ”
50783	50791	50792	50792	Winnie	58	“ I bet Mrs. French loved that . ”
50795	50834	50792	50792	Winnie	58	“ She did ! I have n’t confirmed with her yet — but I feel weird going along with it because I know Hutton does n’t love parties . Although you ’d think his mom would know that . ”
50835	50839	50840	50840	I	441	“ She knows . ”
50843	50852	50840	50840	I	441	“ So will he be okay with it ? ”
50853	50878	50792	50792	Winnie	58	“ Are you kidding ? He hates parties when he is n’t the center of attention . This one will be torture for him . ”
50879	50898	50899	50899	She	58	“ So should I make something up ? Tell her that other event was n’t canceled after all ? ”
50903	50912	50899	50899	She	58	“ I could get in trouble for that . ”
50913	50937	50938	50938	I	441	“ No , do n’t . She could easily go somewhere else , and then we ’ll have no control or inside information . ”
50947	50961	50938	50938	I	441	“ Go ahead and tell her yes . We ’ll get through it . ”
50962	50967	50899	50899	She	58	“ You ’re sure ? ”
50968	50985	50986	50986	I	441	“ I ’m sure . But I ’m not going to let it be a surprise , ”
50990	50997	50986	50986	I	441	“ I have to tell him . ”
50998	51007	51008	51008	Winnie	58	“ Will he go right to his mom ? ”
51013	51025	51008	51008	Winnie	58	“ She made me swear I ’d keep it a secret . ”
51026	51036	51037	51037	I	441	“ She obviously does n’t know you very well , ”
51043	51054	51037	51037	I	441	“ But I ’ll make sure Hutton understands the situation . ”
51055	51058	51061	51061	she	58	“ Thanks . ”
51070	51083	51061	51061	she	58	“ It ’s going to be a beautiful party , I promise . ”
51084	51089	51090	51090	I	441	“ Keep it small , ”
51093	51096	51090	51090	I	441	“ Intimate . ”
51097	51129	51090	51090	I	441	“ I told her the max the patio can accommodate is thirty . And Etoile is also open that night , so the kitchen ca n’t handle too much more food . ”
51130	51139	51090	51090	I	441	“ Thirty is perfect . Keep me posted . ”
51156	51164	51165	51165	he	148	“ You know I hate the phone , ”
51172	51184	51165	51165	he	148	“ I do . But I ca n’t text and drive . ”
51185	51196	51090	51090	I	441	“ Never do that . Did you talk to Gianni ? ”
51197	51224	51165	51165	he	148	“ Yes , and he said it ’s not a problem . I can take Wednesday and Thursday night off . Ellie will cover for me . ”
51225	51234	51165	51165	he	148	“ Good . I ’ll book the trip . ”
51235	51238	51239	51239	My	441	“ Yay ! ”
51245	51269	51270	51270	I	441	“ I ’m heading to the market , and I was wondering if there was anything in particular you ’d like for dinner , ”
51290	51298	51277	51277	him	148	“ Does it have to be vegetarian ? ”
51299	51307	51277	51277	him	148	“ Nope . I can do anything . ”
51308	51311	51312	51312	I	441	“ Steak . ”
51315	51320	51312	51312	I	441	“ Of course steak . ”
51321	51328	51277	51277	him	148	“ Hey , you said anything . ”
51329	51341	51342	51342	I	441	“ I did , and I will cook you a steak , ”
51348	51390	51342	51342	I	441	“ It ’s not that I do n’t think they ’re delicious — I know they are . I just do n’t feel great after I eat meat , so I stick to other things . How ’s your day going ? ”
51391	51422	51277	51277	him	148	“ Fine , although I have a call scheduled later this afternoon with Wade that I ’m not looking forward to , and not just because I hate the phone . ”
51423	51429	51312	51312	I	441	“ Is it about testifying ? ”
51430	51456	51342	51342	I	441	“ Yes . He says he has more details about what questions I ’ll have to answer . He ’s in touch with committee members . ”
51457	51486	51487	51487	I	441	“ Well , more details are good , right ? The better prepared you can be , the more confident you ’ll feel . How was your run ? ”
51493	51502	51487	51487	I	441	“ Did you see the Prancin ’ Grannies ? ”
51503	51547	51548	51548	I	441	“ Yes . They tried to accost me the minute I got out of my car . I had my earbuds in , so I pretended I did n’t hear them and just started running . They could n’t keep up with me . ”
51551	51565	51548	51548	I	441	“ Poor grannies . They just want your attention for a few minutes . ”
51566	51607	51608	51608	I	441	“ They ’re vicious . You do n’t know them . In fact , now that they think we ’re engaged , they ’re probably going to come after you . Better watch your back for those pink bedazzled shirts . ”
51623	51631	51611	51611	I	441	“ I ’ll be on my guard . ”
52052	52056	52040	52040	Hutton	148	“ Want one ? ”
52057	52074	52075	52075	He	148	“ No , thanks . But maybe you could open that bottle of Valpolicella for me ? ”
52085	52094	52075	52075	He	148	“ Anything else I can do to help ? ”
52095	52103	52104	52104	I	441	“ Nope . Just keep me company . ”
52119	52131	52132	52132	He	148	“ Have a beer and a snack and hear me out . ”
52145	52154	52132	52132	He	148	“ Hear you out ? That sounds ominous . ”
52155	52159	52160	52160	I	441	“ Not really . ”
52168	52180	52183	52183	his	148	“ I just want to tell you about a little party . ”
52187	52191	52183	52183	his	148	“ What party ? ”
52192	52214	52227	52227	he	148	“ The surprise party your mom is throwing for us on the patio at Abelard Vineyards the last Saturday in July . ”
52233	52238	52227	52227	he	148	“ No fucking way . ”
52239	52246	52247	52247	I	441	“ The patio is really lovely , ”
52263	52266	52247	52247	I	441	“ No . ”
52267	52290	52183	52183	his	148	“ And the best part is , capacity on the patio is limited to thirty , so it has to be small . ”
52297	52317	52183	52183	his	148	“ It ’s not the patio I ’m objecting to . It ’s the surprise . Also the party . ”
52318	52384	52385	52385	I	441	“ But Hutton , we ’re not even supposed to know about it — at least if Winnie plans it at Abelard , we ’ll have all the details in advance . We ’ll know the terrain , the menu , the timeline — all the relevant details . Even if Winnie pretended Abelard had no available dates , your mom would not give up , ”
52393	52410	52411	52411	Hutton	148	“ She ’ll go somewhere else and we ’ll have no clue when it ’s coming . ”
52427	52437	52438	52438	I	441	“ Our families are happy for us , Hutton . ”
52443	52462	52438	52438	I	441	“ People want to celebrate . We know it ’s not really happening , but they do n’t . ”
52463	52482	52483	52483	He	148	“ I know , but . . . a party ? That was not part of my plan . ”
52488	52507	52483	52483	He	148	“ This engagement was supposed to get people off my back , not invite them to pile on . ”
52508	52516	52517	52517	He	148	“ I know . I ’m sorry . ”
52530	52535	52517	52517	He	148	“ When is it ? ”
52536	52540	52483	52483	He	148	“ July 30th . ”
52541	52548	52483	52483	He	148	“ Two days after my testimony . ”
52549	52560	52561	52561	I	441	“ I realized that after Winnie told me the date , ”
52572	52596	52597	52597	He	148	“ I know the timing stinks , but that was the one day Abelard could fit us in . They had a cancellation . ”
52611	52625	52597	52597	He	148	“ You ’re right . My mother is not going to drop it . ”
52626	52637	52638	52638	He	148	“ We ’re not even supposed to know about it . ”
52649	52656	52657	52657	I	441	“ Do you want this party ? ”
52670	52693	52657	52657	I	441	“ It might be kind of fun . But I feel bad that your parents are going to spend money on it . ”
52694	52737	52597	52597	He	148	“ Listen , my mother has been trying to throw me a party since I was twelve and I ’ve said no every time . No birthday parties , no graduation parties , nothing . She will not care about the cost . ”
52738	52745	52657	52657	I	441	“ So is that a yes ? ”
52746	52753	52754	52754	I	441	“ Do I have a choice ? ”
52757	52781	52754	52754	I	441	“ Not really . Unless you want to call the engagement off before you go to D.C. End things sooner rather than later . ”
52782	52785	52786	52786	he	148	“ No , ”
52790	52806	52786	52786	he	148	“ I can deal with the party . Let ’s stick to the original plan . ”
52852	52860	52861	52861	I	441	“ It ’s like the old days . ”
52869	52879	52861	52861	I	441	“ Sitting here working next to you like this . ”
52880	52885	52886	52886	he	148	“ It ’s better , ”
52916	52920	52897	52897	I	441	“ How so ? ”
52921	52968	52969	52969	He	148	“ Well , I used to sit next to you and wonder what it would be like to kiss you . I ’d come up with all these crazy ways I could make it happen , then talk myself out of every single one of them . ”
52974	53004	53005	53005	I	441	“ I ’d think up tons of things I wanted to say to you — I’d even practice my lines — but never actually be able to say them . ”
53008	53024	53025	53025	His	148	“ Do you remember what you said to me after we danced at the prom ? ”
53029	53035	53025	53025	His	148	“ Do n’t tell me . ”
53036	53054	53055	53055	He	148	“ You said , ‘ That was n’t as bad as I thought it would be . ’ ”
53058	53095	53096	53096	I	441	“ That is not what I rehearsed . I totally chickened out . Sort of like I did at your bedroom door Saturday night instead of telling you the real reason I was about to knock . ”
53105	53137	53096	53096	I	441	“ You mean you were n’t really coming to my room with no shirt on to see if I was thirsty ? I ’m aghast ! You had me totally fooled ! ”
53138	53143	53144	53144	He	148	“ That ’s it . ”
53168	53173	53174	53174	I	441	“ What is this ? ”
53184	53187	53174	53174	I	441	“ Kidnapping ? ”
53188	53195	53196	53196	He	148	“ We ’re not kids anymore . ”
53219	53224	53196	53196	He	148	“ Hutton , wait ! ”
53238	53269	53230	53230	I	441	“ I have to take a shower . I never took one today and I ’ve been running around and cooking and getting sweaty . I wo n’t smell nice . ”
53292	53309	53310	53310	I	441	“ You smell fucking great . And I ’m only going to make you get sweatier . ”
53319	53339	53313	53313	his	148	“ Compromise — how about you give me ten quick minutes in the shower and then you join me ? ”
53340	53344	53345	53345	He	148	“ Five minutes . ”
53356	53359	53345	53345	He	148	“ Go . ”
53591	53596	53579	53579	he	148	“ What ’s this ? ”
53597	53603	53604	53604	I	441	“ It ’s a bath . ”
53615	53620	53621	53621	He	148	“ Come and play . ”
53629	53635	53621	53621	He	148	“ What ’s that smell ? ”
53636	53648	53579	53579	he	148	“ Lavender and vanilla . It ’s supposed to relax you . ”
53649	53655	53656	53656	he	148	“ It ’s not working , ”
53671	53684	53663	53663	his	148	“ In fact , I ’m the opposite of relaxed right now . ”
53685	53692	53693	53693	I	441	“ Then get in with me . ”
53706	53715	53716	53716	He	148	“ I promise to make it all better . ”
53728	53745	53716	53716	He	148	“ Felicity , there ’s no way we ’re both going to fit in that bathtub . ”
53746	53782	53783	53783	I	441	“ I ’m not saying it wo n’t be a tight squeeze , but I ’m sure two people as skilled in geometry as we are can come up with a solution to this problem . ”
53792	53833	53834	53834	I	441	“ For example , you can lie on your back and I ’ll lie on top of you — a parallelogram . Or you can sit , and I ’ll straddle your lap — more of a trapezoid . Or , ”
53842	53856	53834	53834	I	441	“ you can stand , and I ’ll kneel in front of you . ”
53862	53870	53871	53871	I	441	“ And what do you call that ? ”
53876	53880	53871	53871	I	441	“ A blowjob . ”
53911	53918	53906	53906	I	441	“ Want to play a little ? ”
53919	53922	53923	53923	His	845	“ Play ? ”
53930	53934	53923	53923	His	845	“ Play what ? ”
53944	53951	53923	53923	His	845	“ My parents are n’t home . ”
53952	53955	53923	53923	His	845	“ Huh ? ”
53956	53964	53965	53965	I	441	“ So you have to be quiet . ”
53987	53992	53993	53993	His	845	“ Oh , fuck . ”
53999	54007	53993	53993	His	845	“ You want to play teenage us ? ”
54042	54045	53993	53993	His	845	“ Yes . ”
54046	54060	54061	54061	I	441	“ You do realize that teenage me already came all over your face . ”
54069	54089	54061	54061	I	441	“ Come on . Play with me . I have confidence in your grown - up self - control . ”
54090	54097	54098	54098	I	441	“ That makes one of us . ”
54117	54130	54098	54098	I	441	“ I ’ve thought about this while we study . Have you ? ”
54131	54134	54135	54135	I	441	“ Yeah . ”
54142	54146	54135	54135	I	441	“ And afterward . ”
54147	54150	54098	54098	I	441	“ Afterward ? ”
54151	54164	54135	54135	I	441	“ Late at night . When I ’m alone in my bed . ”
54165	54169	54170	54170	I	441	“ Tell me . ”
54188	54195	54170	54170	I	441	“ What do you think about ? ”
54196	54215	54216	54216	His	845	“ This . You , on your knees in front of me . My cock in your mouth . ”
54229	54233	54216	54216	His	845	“ Like this ? ”
54246	54249	54234	54234	I	441	“ Yes . ”
54323	54327	54328	54328	I	441	“ Show me , ”
54337	54351	54328	54328	I	441	“ What you do late at night . When you think about this . ”
54352	54357	54328	54328	I	441	“ Are you serious ? ”
54358	54361	54362	54362	I	441	“ Yes . ”
54376	54380	54381	54381	He	845	“ Or else . ”
54409	54416	54387	54387	he	845	“ Is this what you want ? ”
54581	54585	54586	54586	he	845	“ Touch yourself , ”
54664	54667	54668	54668	His	845	“ Yes . ”
54675	54678	54668	54668	His	845	“ Yes . ”
54720	54723	54724	54724	he	845	“ Fuck , ”
54730	54737	54724	54724	he	845	“ Fuck , that ’s hot . ”
54738	54745	54746	54746	I	441	“ I ’m thinking about you , ”
54757	54768	54769	54769	His	845	“ I love thinking about you when I do this . ”
54788	54793	54773	54773	he	845	“ Is that true ? ”
54794	54797	54798	54798	I	441	“ Yes , ”
54825	54837	54805	54805	He	845	“ I ’d pretend your hands were on me this way . ”
54838	54842	54843	54843	His	845	“ My tongue . ”
54849	54856	54843	54843	His	845	“ Did you think about that ? ”
54857	54862	54863	54863	I	441	“ I am now . ”
54886	54889	54890	54890	He	845	“ Fuck . ”
54908	54918	54890	54890	He	845	“ This is going to be over too soon . ”
54919	54923	54924	54924	I	441	“ Let me . ”
54986	54989	54990	54990	he	845	“ Jesus , ”
55049	55054	55034	55034	He	845	“ Are you sure ? ”
55214	55218	55219	55219	he	845	“ My turn , ”
55312	55318	55319	55319	Felicity	148	“ Tell me a secret , ”
55329	55333	55319	55319	Felicity	148	“ A secret ? ”
55409	55425	55401	55401	they	853	“ Yes . Or a story from when you were little . I like those . ”
55434	55447	55401	55401	they	853	“ When I was young , I thought I had magic powers . ”
55448	55457	55458	55458	Her	852	“ Oooh ! What kind of magic powers ? ”
55485	55514	55401	55401	they	853	“ I thought I could control the outcome of things — favorably for me , of course — or prevent bad things from happening , with certain actions . ”
55515	55521	55467	55467	she	852	“ What would you do ? ”
55522	55556	55401	55401	they	853	“ Small rituals like always putting my right sock on first , always sitting on the right side of the car , touching my nose as I entered a room , counting things . ”
55557	55563	55564	55564	She	852	“ Did you have OCD ? ”
55580	55611	55573	55573	I	441	“ I do n’t know . If I ’d been evaluated back then , they might have diagnosed me that way , but I never told anyone about my powers . ”
55612	55616	55401	55401	they	853	“ Why not ? ”
55617	55625	55573	55573	I	441	“ Because then they would n’t work . ”
55626	55629	55630	55630	Her	852	“ Ah . ”
55639	55648	55630	55630	Her	852	“ When did you stop believing in them ? ”
55659	55665	55630	55630	Her	852	“ When my grandfather died . ”
55671	55677	55630	55630	Her	852	“ How old were you ? ”
55678	55681	55682	55682	She	852	“ Eleven . ”
55694	55708	55709	55709	I	441	“ Is this the grandpa that gave you the signed Ray Bradbury paperbacks ? ”
55715	55718	55712	55712	she	852	“ Yes . ”
55719	55731	55732	55732	My	441	“ Tell me more about him . What was he like ? ”
55749	55803	55712	55712	she	852	“ He loved puzzles , and we used to work on them together all the time . He loved baseball and never missed one of my games . He wore Pinaud Clubman aftershave , and sometimes I catch a whiff of it in a crowd and it ’s like he ’s right there . ”
55804	55809	55712	55712	she	852	“ Maybe he is . ”
55810	55818	55819	55819	She	852	“ Now you sound like my mother . ”
55822	55833	55819	55819	She	852	“ Do you still have the books he gave you ? ”
55834	55867	55712	55712	she	852	“ Yes . They ’re not in pristine condition or anything — he read them over and over again , and I did too — but I ’d never sell them anyway . ”
55868	55880	55881	55881	She	852	“ Of course not . That kind of thing is priceless . ”
55888	55898	55881	55881	She	852	“ I ’m sorry you lost him so young . ”
55899	55940	55819	55819	She	852	“ His death hit me hard . It was n’t sudden — we knew he was sick — but I was so sure of my ability to prevent anything terrible from happening that I was totally unprepared when it happened . ”
55941	55947	55948	55948	she	852	“ Did you blame yourself ? ”
55952	56013	56014	56014	She	852	“ Not exactly , but I started to doubt myself in every way . Soon after that was when I struck out three times during my baseball team ’s championship game . I remember thinking then that it was clear — I was n’t magical . I was n’t even that special or talented . And everyone fucking knew it . ”
56033	56089	56090	56090	She	852	“ I remember coming home and lying on my bed , just staring at the ceiling and thinking , I ’m not who I thought I was . The world did n’t work like I thought it did . And maybe everyone else had known this all along , and I was just an idiot . ”
56095	56159	56160	56160	I	441	“ We moved right after that . My parents wanted a change of scene , and I think they even thought it would be good for me . They could see something was off . I ’d gone from a cocky , smart - mouthed fifth grader who only came home to eat and sleep into a kid who hated leaving the house . ”
56163	56184	56160	56160	I	441	“ But I think the move made it harder . I had to start over — without my magic powers . ”
56185	56192	56193	56193	she	852	“ But then you met me , ”
56197	56207	56193	56193	she	852	“ And that was a good thing , right ? ”
56208	56215	56160	56160	I	441	“ That was a good thing . ”
56216	56235	56193	56193	she	852	“ Until I made you pretend to be my fiancé . Attend social gatherings . Host dinner parties . ”
56236	56243	56193	56193	she	852	“ Yes , but . . . ”
56262	56269	56247	56247	I	441	“ It also has its perks . ”
56318	56323	56325	56327	one of them	350	“ There he is ! ”
56360	56365	56348	56348	they	76	“ Hello , ladies . ”
56400	56405	56391	56391	I	441	“ How are you ? ”
56406	56418	56348	56348	they	76	“ Fine , fine . We were hoping to catch you , ”
56434	56445	56348	56348	they	76	“ We want to hear all about your big news ! ”
56446	56451	56391	56391	I	441	“ We know her . ”
56468	56476	56348	56348	they	76	“ We ’re friends with her grandmother . ”
56477	56484	56485	56485	My	441	“ Oh . You mean Felicity . ”
56501	56510	56521	56521	her	441	“ Yes . Her grandmother is Daphne Sawyer , ”
56524	56541	56521	56521	her	441	“ She and her husband John own Cloverleigh Farms , but their kids run it now . ”
56542	56555	56556	56557	Another granny	860	“ I heard the wedding is going to be at Cloverleigh Farms . ”
56576	56581	56570	56570	her	860	“ Is that true ? ”
56582	56589	56559	56567	this one with seriously thick penciled - in eyebrows	861	“ Uh , we hope so . ”
56641	56653	56628	56628	They	1716	“ I just love the Sawyers . So kind and welcoming . ”
56654	56673	56628	56628	They	1716	“ And so generous . When Hank had gall bladder surgery last year , they sent a pie . ”
56674	56690	56628	56628	They	1716	“ We always play in John Sawyer ’s charity golf outing . Such good people . ”
56691	56718	56628	56628	They	1716	“ Daphne still invites me to the annual staff Christmas party . We go every year , even though I have n’t worked there in years . ”
56724	56734	56628	56628	They	1716	“ I ’ll probably be invited to the wedding . ”
56750	56758	56628	56628	They	1716	“ Will it be a big wedding ? ”
56767	56772	56628	56628	They	1716	“ Lots of guests ? ”
56773	56776	56777	56777	I	441	“ No , ”
56781	56785	56777	56777	I	441	“ Why not ? ”
56805	56813	56814	56814	I	441	“ We want to keep it small , ”
56824	56827	56814	56814	I	441	“ Small ! ”
56834	56847	56814	56814	I	441	“ When you ’re a local celebrity ? That ’s no fun ! ”
56848	56855	56628	56628	They	1716	“ You should do something spectacular , ”
56860	56864	56628	56628	They	1716	“ Like fireworks . ”
56865	56877	56814	56814	I	441	“ Oooh ! My grandson flies those planes that tow banners , ”
56883	56889	56628	56628	They	1716	“ You should do that . ”
56890	56904	56628	56628	They	1716	“ My Alfred drives those horse - drawn carriages that take tourists around , ”
56913	56923	56628	56628	They	1716	“ Something like that would be nice and splashy . ”
56924	56927	56628	56628	They	1716	“ Yes , ”
56936	56949	56628	56628	They	1716	“ Is n’t a small wedding just a bit selfish of you ? ”
56950	56953	56954	56954	I	441	“ Selfish ? ”
56959	56989	56954	56954	I	441	“ Everyone in town is so happy for you ! We feel proud that such a brilliant , successful young man chose a hometown girl to settle down with ! ”
56990	56996	56628	56628	They	1716	“ It shows real character ! ”
56997	57019	56628	56628	They	1716	“ It shows that no matter how much money you make or how famous you get , what matters is family . ”
57020	57032	56954	56954	I	441	“ Yes ! Friends and neighbors are an extension of family . ”
57033	57044	57045	57045	They	863	“ And in a small town , everyone is family . ”
57063	57079	57045	57045	They	863	“ Yeah ! That ’s right ! You tell him , Gladys ! Atta girl ! ”
57080	57109	57110	57111	Neon sweatband	163	“ So if you ’re not going to let us share in the joy of your big day , we just do n’t know how to take it . ”
57123	57129	57110	57111	Neon sweatband	163	“ Our hearts might break . ”
57130	57138	57110	57111	Neon sweatband	163	“ You think about that , sonny . ”
57144	57150	57151	57151	They	863	“ Come on , girls . ”
57341	57344	57333	57333	I	441	“ Hello ? ”
57345	57348	57349	57349	Wade	77	“ Dude , ”
57352	57362	57349	57349	Wade	77	“ You answered . Is that a thing now ? ”
57376	57384	57365	57365	I	441	“ Not really . What ’s up ? ”
57385	57406	57365	57365	I	441	“ Why did n’t you tell me about your engagement yesterday , asshole ? I just read about it online . ”
57407	57413	57414	57414	He	77	“ I guess I forgot . ”
57417	57426	57414	57414	He	77	“ What the fuck ? Who is she ? ”
57427	57431	57432	57432	I	441	“ Felicity MacAllister . ”
57454	57461	57414	57414	He	77	“ The girl from back home ? ”
57462	57465	57414	57414	He	77	“ Yeah . ”
57466	57474	57414	57414	He	77	“ Kinda sudden , is n’t it ? ”
57475	57488	57414	57414	He	77	“ Not really . I ’ve known her since I was twelve . ”
57489	57497	57414	57414	He	77	“ You knock her up or something ? ”
57498	57504	57414	57414	He	77	“ Fuck off . No . ”
57505	57508	57509	57509	he	77	“ Dude , ”
57512	57523	57414	57414	He	77	“ Does n’t even matter . Do n’t do it . ”
57524	57527	57414	57414	He	77	“ Huh ? ”
57528	57541	57414	57414	He	77	“ Do n’t fucking get married . It will ruin your life . ”
57542	57561	57414	57414	He	77	“ Is this the point of your call , Hasbrouck ? If so , I ’m hanging up . ”
57562	57642	57414	57414	He	77	“ I know it seems like a good idea now , but the shine comes off . As soon as the ink is dry on that marriage certificate , she will not be the woman you think she is . That ’s what they do — they pretend to be cool so you ’ll propose , and then they turn into crazy , controlling lunatics once they ’ve got your last name . I ’ve never been so miserable . ”
57643	57648	57649	57649	He	77	“ We ’re different . ”
57653	57675	57649	57649	He	77	“ Truth , man . If I was you , I ’d still be in L.A. fucking Zlatka in my Porsche . ”
57676	57683	57414	57414	He	77	“ I ’m sure you would . ”
57684	57700	57701	57701	He	77	“ How ’d you fuck that up , anyway ? She was crazy about you . ”
57705	57731	57701	57701	He	77	“ Susie said she read somewhere it was because Zlatka did n’t like being submissive in the bedroom . She wanted to be the boss . ”
57732	57742	57649	57649	He	77	“ You ’d have to ask Zlatka about that . ”
57743	57772	57701	57701	He	77	“ Dude , I ’d totally let her tie me up and slap me around if she wanted to . You really broke it off because of that ? ”
57773	57776	57777	57777	My	441	“ No . ”
57781	57791	57777	57777	My	441	“ We fought all the time . It sucked . ”
57792	57798	57799	57799	he	77	“ Tell me about it , ”
57802	57871	57799	57799	he	77	“ I ’m stuck on this yacht in the Mediterranean listening to Susie whine about what a shitty husband I am day in , day out . Like , what does she want that she does n’t have ? She ’s got the house , the car , the clothes , the vacations . I pay all her fucking bills . What more does she want from me ? ”
57884	57925	57878	57878	I	441	“ Anyway , that ’s all I ’m saying . Everyone pretends to be someone they ’re not to get what they want , and you ca n’t make anyone happy in the long run . Do n’t even try . ”
58014	58019	58020	58020	Felicity	148	“ Hey , you . ”
58041	58047	58020	58020	Felicity	148	“ How was your day ? ”
58048	58061	58069	58069	She	872	“ It was okay . How did everything go with the proposal ? ”
58062	58068	58069	58069	She	872	“ It was so great ! ”
58103	58132	58133	58133	I	441	“ Ellie was completely surprised , and the whole thing went off without a hitch — which is pretty impressive , considering what an elaborate scheme it was . ”
58164	58188	58189	58189	Felicity	148	“ She had a bucket of fifty balls , and she kept throwing one after another , and she could not dunk him , ”
58194	58208	58189	58189	Felicity	148	“ Lucky for her , my cousin Chip Carswell was in the crowd ! ”
58209	58215	58216	58216	I	441	“ The White Sox pitcher ? ”
58221	58234	58216	58216	I	441	“ That ’s your cousin ? How did I not know that ? ”
58235	58316	58317	58317	My	441	“ Yes — he ’s Frannie ’s nephew . His mom is her older sister , April . And his dad is Tyler Shaw , who was also a Major League pitcher . Tyler and April are married now , but they had him when they were like eighteen and gave him up for adoption . They only reconnected later , when he was a teenager , but he was already off at college by the time you moved here . ”
58322	58362	58363	58363	She	441	“ I guess I have a lot to learn about your family history . I never knew any of that . Carswell is a great pitcher . So was Shaw . Two of the best lefties in the game . ”
58366	58395	58363	58363	She	441	“ Which Ellie was glad about , because she dragged Chip out there and made him throw for her . Gianni got dunked with every ball Chip threw . ”
58396	58400	58515	58516	Gianni Lupo	150	“ I bet . ”
58401	58435	58363	58363	She	441	“ But it was only fair , because back when they were seventeen , Gianni dunked Ellie that many times . Then she threw a bunch of pies in his face in retaliation . ”
58436	58448	58363	58363	She	441	“ So where in all that dunking did he propose tonight ? ”
58449	58470	58515	58516	Gianni Lupo	150	“ Oh ! The last ball in the bucket was a fake — it opened up like a ring box . ”
58471	58476	58477	58477	She	441	“ I ’m impressed . ”
58480	58486	58477	58477	She	441	“ It was so romantic . ”
58487	58494	58363	58363	She	441	“ I assume she said yes ? ”
58495	58509	58510	58510	I	441	“ She said yes . Then he threw a pie in her face . ”
58537	58546	58477	58477	She	441	“ Sounds like it was quite a show . ”
58547	58579	58580	58580	I	441	“ It was amazing . I also spoke to Winnie . She said your mom confirmed the engagement party for thirty people at five o’clock , the last Saturday in July . ”
58583	58586	58580	58580	I	441	“ Great . ”
58587	58595	58477	58477	She	441	“ Did you practice your toast yet ? ”
58596	58599	58600	58600	I	441	“ No . ”
58607	58622	58623	58623	She	441	“ But I did chat with the Prancin ’ Grannies for seven whole minutes . ”
58628	58640	58623	58623	She	441	“ I ’m very proud of you . Was it hard ? ”
58641	58666	58580	58580	I	441	“ It was okay . I did n’t enjoy it , but I did n’t feel like my skin was crawling with fire ants . ”
58667	58677	58580	58580	I	441	“ I ’d say that ’s a good thing . ”
58678	58691	58623	58623	She	441	“ Several of them know Daphne Sawyer . Is that your grandmother ? ”
58692	58749	58580	58580	I	441	“ Yes ! That ’s Frannie ’s mom . She ’s wonderful . She and her husband John were the original owners of Cloverleigh Farms , but they gave it to their kids , and now they live in Florida most of the year . They spend summers here , so they ’re probably in town . ”
58750	58792	58793	58793	Felicity	148	“ She ’s likely getting inundated with calls from the Prancin ’ Grannies right now . They were all very eager to establish a connection to the family . I think they ’re all hoping for an invitation to the wedding . ”
58799	58808	58793	58793	Felicity	148	“ Just tell them it ’s very small . ”
58809	58817	58623	58623	She	441	“ I did . They shamed me . ”
58818	58822	58623	58623	She	441	“ Shamed you ? ”
58823	58875	58876	58876	She	441	“ Yes , they said this whole town is so happy for us and is n’t it just a bit selfish of me to have such a small wedding that no one else can share in the joy ? They told me to think about that , and they pranced away . ”
58881	58888	58876	58876	She	441	“ I can picture it perfectly . ”
58889	58909	58793	58793	Felicity	148	“ We ’re all set for New York , by the way . Our flight leaves at eleven tomorrow . ”
58910	58918	58919	58919	She	441	“ What ? I need to pack ! ”
58931	58936	58919	58919	She	441	“ How many nights ? ”
58937	58940	58876	58876	She	441	“ Two . ”
58941	58951	58919	58919	She	441	“ Will I have to dress up for anything ? ”
58952	58959	58960	58960	She	441	“ Only if you want to . ”
58973	58988	58989	58989	I	441	“ Hutton ! What are the plans ? Are we doing fancy billionaire things ? ”
58992	58999	58989	58989	I	441	“ What are fancy billionaire things ? ”
59000	59022	59023	59023	She	441	“ You know — going to a ball or the opera or some sort of gala . Places fancy people go . ”
59034	59068	59023	59023	She	441	“ Not that I need those things . I ’d be just as happy staying at a Motel 6 and eating pizza slices on the street . I just want to pack right . ”
59069	59098	59099	59099	She	441	“ I do n’t know if there are any balls this week , Cinderella , but I would be glad to take you out . Pack something nice . ”
59117	59123	59108	59108	she	441	“ I ’m so excited ! ”
59124	59127	59130	59130	her	441	“ Good . ”
59476	59483	59473	59473	I	441	“ It ’s your turn tonight . ”
59484	59488	59473	59473	I	441	“ For what ? ”
59489	59512	59473	59473	I	441	“ The secret . I feel like it ’s always me rambling on about shit . Tonight , you tell me something . ”
59513	59523	59473	59473	I	441	“ Hmm . What do you want to know ? ”
59592	59607	59582	59582	I	441	“ You mentioned that you break up with anyone who says they love you . ”
59608	59611	59582	59582	I	441	“ Yes . ”
59612	59620	59582	59582	I	441	“ How many times has that happened ? ”
59621	59624	59625	59625	she	895	“ Twice , ”
59638	59648	59582	59582	I	441	“ Once in college , and once in Chicago . ”
59649	59656	59582	59582	I	441	“ How long were those relationships ? ”
59657	59666	59582	59582	I	441	“ Not that long . A few months . ”
59667	59680	59582	59582	I	441	“ And you did n’t feel that way about either of them ? ”
59681	59699	59700	59700	She	895	“ Nope . I ’ve never been in love . I ’m very careful with my emotions . ”
59706	59714	59700	59700	She	895	“ I ’m good at rationing them . ”
59715	59721	59582	59582	I	441	“ What do you mean ? ”
59722	59772	59700	59700	She	895	“ Well , let ’s say feelings are like a super rare or expensive ingredient . Truffles or something . You do n’t just throw them in whole . You shave them , adding a tiny amount to finish off the dish . A little goes a long way . ”
59773	59783	59784	59784	She	895	“ Got it . So you shave your feelings ? ”
59791	59838	59784	59784	She	895	“ You know what I mean . I give them out sparingly . And when the person I ’m dating dishes them out too generously , too quickly , I go into panic mode and just want out . I told you , it ’s weird . ”
59839	59846	59847	59847	I	441	“ No , I get it , ”
59851	59864	59847	59847	I	441	“ That ’s me at a business meeting . Or a party . ”
59865	59884	59784	59784	She	895	“ Yeah , but at least you can sneak out . I have to craft an exit strategy . ”
59885	59889	59890	59890	She	895	“ Like what ? ”
59893	59957	59890	59890	She	895	“ Okay , I ’m not proud of this , but I told the first guy I was thinking about becoming a nun and wanted to try out celibacy . That was enough to scare him off . I told the second guy I was moving back to Michigan . But he kept coming around , so then I actually had to move . ”
59958	59974	59975	59975	She	895	“ Wait a minute . You moved back here to get out of a relationship ? ”
59980	60047	59975	59975	She	895	“ Not only for that reason . I ’d been thinking about it for a while . But that was a good push — and it was the right decision . I ’m happy I came back . And . . . I did n’t love those guys . If I had , I would n’t have been able to walk away so easily . Right ? ”
60048	60071	59890	59890	She	895	“ You ’re asking the wrong person . I ’ve never been in love either . I ’m not wired for it . ”
60072	60078	59975	59975	She	895	“ How do you mean ? ”
60079	60126	60127	60127	She	897	“ I mean , some people are good at getting out of their heads and letting someone else have , I do n’t know , unfettered access to them — all their flaws and imperfections . Revealing themselves . That ’s never going to be me . ”
60142	60162	60127	60127	She	897	“ Do you think something is wrong with us ? I sometimes wonder if I ’m cursed or something . ”
60163	60166	60167	60167	I	441	“ No , ”
60171	60197	60198	60198	She	897	“ I think we ’re just fine . In fact , I think we ’re smarter than everyone , because we know ourselves so well . ”
60207	60229	60198	60198	She	897	“ Yes , exactly . What good does it do to stay in a relationship you know wo n’t work out ? ”
60230	60247	60248	60248	She	897	“ If we ’re cursed , it ’s with superior intelligence and keen self - awareness . ”
60251	60289	60248	60248	She	897	“ Yes ! We know our strengths and weaknesses . We know that if we ca n’t swim , we do n’t jump in the deep end of the pool . We stay in the shallow part . ”
60290	60301	60302	60302	I	441	“ Or we skip the swim and stay in bed , ”
60312	60325	60302	60302	I	441	“ There ’s a lot of fun to be had in bed . ”
60326	60332	60333	60333	She	897	“ There is with you . ”
60345	60353	60341	60341	she	897	“ More than I ever thought possible . ”
60386	60394	60395	60395	I	441	“ Hutton ! Look at this view ! ”
60412	60418	60419	60419	He	153	“ I ’ve seen it . ”
60433	60439	60419	60419	He	153	“ But it is impressive . ”
60440	60457	60458	60458	I	441	“ It ’s more than impressive — it ’s unreal ! This whole day is unreal ! ”
60564	60570	60571	60571	he	909	“ We should get going , ”
60574	60583	60571	60571	he	909	“ Are you going to tell me where ? ”
60584	60596	60571	60571	he	909	“ No . That ’s the whole point of a surprise . ”
60597	60602	60571	60571	he	909	“ You hate surprises . ”
60603	60609	60610	60610	he	909	“ I hate being surprised , ”
60613	60619	60571	60571	he	909	“ There ’s a difference . ”
60620	60632	60633	60633	He	909	“ Let me just get a few pics of the bathroom . ”
60678	60689	60690	60690	Hutton	148	“ It will still be here when we get back , ”
60716	60731	60732	60732	I	441	“ I know . Sorry , you ’re probably used to all this luxury , ”
60736	60784	60785	60785	He	909	“ But I ’m more of a budget traveler , so this is pretty cool to me . And chances are I ’m only going to be the fake fiancée of a billionaire once in my life , so I want to make the most of it . ”
60788	60800	60785	60785	He	909	“ Go ahead . We can leave when you ’re ready . ”
60841	60858	60821	60821	He	909	“ Am I dressed okay ? You look so nice , and I ’m in jeans . ”
60859	60867	60821	60821	He	909	“ You can wear anything you want . ”
60868	60884	60821	60821	He	909	“ And I ’ll have time to come home and change before dinner , right ? ”
60885	60888	60821	60821	He	909	“ Yes . ”
60889	60897	60821	60821	He	909	“ Then I just need a minute . ”
60898	60917	60918	60918	He	909	“ No problem . I ’m going to check in with my assistant on our tickets for tonight . ”
61086	61089	61090	61090	I	441	“ Hey . ”
61096	61119	61120	61120	He	909	“ Thanks for all this . It was n’t necessary , but it ’s the best vacation I ’ve ever been on . ”
61123	61137	61120	61120	He	909	“ We just got here . We have n’t even done anything yet . ”
61138	61164	61120	61120	He	909	“ Does n’t matter what we do , and maybe it would n’t even matter where we are . I just love being with you . ”
61165	61181	61120	61120	He	909	“ Okay , I need you to remember that nice feeling in about three minutes . ”
61182	61187	61188	61188	He	909	“ What ? Why ? ”
61194	61199	61188	61188	He	909	“ Or one minute . ”
61222	61230	61188	61188	He	909	“ Hutton ! What ’s going on ? ”
61231	61238	61239	61239	I	441	“ Just relax and have fun . ”
61250	61263	61239	61239	I	441	“ You said no Tiffany . We agreed on a replica ring . ”
61264	61286	61239	61239	I	441	“ But we need to know what we ’re replicating , right ? This is just a little exercise in reconnaissance . ”
61287	61291	61239	61239	I	441	“ It is ? ”
61292	61298	61299	61300	The driver	580	“ Yes . Trust me . ”
61341	61353	61336	61336	He	909	“ Felicity , come on . It ’s just for fun . ”
61354	61357	61336	61336	He	909	“ Really ? ”
61358	61388	61336	61336	He	909	“ Yes . I thought you ’d enjoy it , but if you want , we do n’t even have to go in . I ’ll cancel the appointment . ”
61389	61398	61399	61399	I	441	“ No , no . It ’s fine . ”
61413	61418	61420	61420	I	441	“ I trust you . ”
61507	61512	61513	61513	he	148	“ Are you okay ? ”
61525	61530	61513	61513	he	148	“ You seem nervous . ”
61531	61538	61539	61539	I	441	“ Of course I ’m nervous ! ”
61543	61554	61539	61539	I	441	“ These rings probably cost more than my college education . ”
61555	61568	61513	61513	he	148	“ Stop worrying about that . This is supposed to be fun . ”
61569	61576	61577	61577	James	175	“ It is , but I — ”
61584	61593	61594	61594	I	441	“ Here we go . Try this one . ”
61665	61668	61669	61669	I	441	“ Oh , ”
61672	61678	61669	61669	I	441	“ It ’s so beautiful . ”
61679	61687	61689	61689	James	175	“ I think that ’s the one , ”
61692	61696	61697	61697	Hutton	148	“ Is it ? ”
61714	61721	61722	61722	James	175	“ Yes . This is it . ”
61750	61758	61760	61760	James	175	“ Champagne sounds great , thank you . ”
61774	61791	61766	61766	I	441	“ You ’re not going to buy it , right ? That is n’t the plan . ”
61792	61798	61799	61799	he	148	“ I know the plan , ”
61803	61812	61799	61799	he	148	“ Then why are you smiling like that ? ”
61813	61817	61766	61766	I	441	“ Like what ? ”
61818	61828	61829	61829	He	148	“ Like you know something I do n’t know . ”
61832	61839	61766	61766	I	441	“ I thought you trusted me . ”
61840	61846	61799	61799	he	148	“ I changed my mind . ”
61847	61850	61851	61851	He	148	“ Felicity . ”
61856	61869	61851	61851	He	148	“ You can relax . We ’ll leave here without a ring . ”
61870	61873	61799	61799	he	148	“ Promise ? ”
61874	61877	61878	61878	He	148	“ Yes . ”
61890	61894	61878	61878	He	148	“ I promise . ”
61895	61899	61900	61900	James	175	“ Ms. MacAllister ? ”
61999	62005	62006	62006	I	441	“ What do you think ? ”
62010	62020	62006	62006	I	441	“ Should we look around for a replica ring ? ”
62021	62046	62047	62047	I	441	“ Not in this neighborhood . I thought maybe tomorrow we could go down to Chinatown . There are lots of jewelry stores there . ”
62058	62064	62047	62047	I	441	“ That sounds like fun . ”
62065	62109	62006	62006	I	441	“ The car should be here any minute . While we were inside , my assistant texted that we have a dinner reservation at 5:30 , and our tickets will be waiting for us at the Met box office for a 7:30 ballet . ”
62110	62118	62047	62047	I	441	“ Ooooh ! What are we seeing ? ”
62119	62130	62047	62047	I	441	“ Romeo and Juliet performed by the American Ballet Theater . ”
62131	62138	62139	62139	I	441	“ Really ? That ’s perfect ! ”
62144	62158	62139	62139	I	441	“ But that does n’t leave much time for us to get ready . ”
62159	62189	62190	62190	He	935	“ We ’re having dinner downstairs at The Pierre , so we ’ll be fine . And if you need more time , I ’ll have dinner sent up . ”
62196	62202	62190	62190	He	935	“ Here ’s the car . ”
62243	62250	62252	62253	the driver	580	“ Of course , Mr. French , ”
62255	62262	62263	62263	I	441	“ Is that the same guy ? ”
62271	62281	62263	62263	I	441	“ Yes . I hired him for three days . ”
62282	62291	62292	62292	Hutton	148	“ So he just waits around for us ? ”
62295	62307	62292	62292	Hutton	148	“ That ’s his job . I pay for his time . ”
62308	62311	62312	62312	I	441	“ Sheesh . ”
62325	62373	62312	62312	I	441	“ How do you get used to this ? To being able to afford luxuries like not ever having to hail a cab , and fireplaces in your hotel rooms , and — oh yeah — chartering private jets to take you where you want to go ? ”
62374	62383	62384	62384	he	148	“ At first , it was really strange , ”
62387	62449	62450	62450	I	441	“ For a long time , I was still riding my bike everywhere , staying at inexpensive places , flying coach . Wade always thought I was crazy . But he ’d grown up with a ton of money , so he was used to luxury . My mother does n’t even throw away those plastic containers cream cheese comes in . ”
62453	62465	62450	62450	I	441	“ How ’d you finally get more comfortable with being rich ? ”
62466	62492	62312	62312	I	441	“ Little by little , I guess . I ’m still not completely used to it , and I do feel guilty about it sometimes . ”
62493	62508	62509	62509	He	148	“ But you give a lot of money to charity , do n’t you ? ”
62512	62566	62567	62567	He	148	“ Yes , and that helps . I also paid off all my sister ’s college loans and her grad school tuition . I offered to buy both her and Neil and my parents new houses , but they all told me to fuck off — not in those words , of course . ”
62572	62584	62567	62567	He	148	“ Actually , I think my sister did use those words . ”
62585	62590	62591	62591	I	441	“ I believe it , ”
62594	62602	62591	62591	I	441	“ She seems very independent and proud . ”
62603	62611	62567	62567	He	148	“ She is all that and more . ”
62619	62672	62567	62567	He	148	“ I have an older sister too . I know how they can be . It ’s funny , I have n’t been to a ballet in forever , but Millie used to perform in them — not professionally , but she was a pretty serious dance student back in the day . ”
62673	62677	62678	62678	I	441	“ Oh yeah ? ”
62681	62707	62678	62678	I	441	“ She danced until she was maybe fifteen or so and then quit . She even went to a performing arts school for a year . ”
62708	62714	62567	62567	He	148	“ Why did she quit ? ”
62715	62781	62678	62678	I	441	“ She said she just outgrew her passion for it , but I think a lot of it was related to pressure to look a certain way . Ballet dancers are traditionally very thin and small - boned , and Millie is built differently — it was a constant struggle for her to maintain a certain size and she was just tired of fighting it . ”
62782	62791	62678	62678	I	441	“ Was it hard for her to quit ? ”
62792	62846	62847	62847	I	441	“ Oh yeah . There were a lot of tears and serious talks behind closed doors . But I think my dad and Frannie were really glad she decided to quit because she was so unhappy . I was only like eleven or twelve , but I remember the tension in the house . ”
62874	62924	62861	62861	her	2105	“ But she seemed relieved once the decision was made . Plus , the twins had just been born , so there was a lot of chaos in the house . Frannie was glad to have Millie around more often to help . She was so good with them . ”
62925	62930	62931	62931	I	441	“ You were n’t ? ”
62934	62983	62931	62931	I	441	“ Not like Millie was . I thought they were noisy and boring . I liked them better when they got bigger and I could read stories to them — they liked the silly voices I ’d do . But anyway , I ’m really excited about tonight . ”
63010	63030	62991	62991	I	441	“ Thanks again for everything . Sorry I got a little weird back there . I do trust you . ”
63031	63039	63040	63040	We	943	“ Good . And you ’re welcome . ”
63256	63259	63247	63247	Millie	2105	“ Hello ? ”
63260	63267	63268	63268	I	441	“ Are you dripping in diamonds ? ”
63271	63284	63285	63285	She	2105	“ No . I tried on a few today at Tiffany though . ”
63288	63298	63285	63285	She	2105	“ Stop it ! You really went to Tiffany ? ”
63299	63318	63247	63247	Millie	2105	“ Yes , but only to look . We ’re going to Chinatown tomorrow to buy a fake . ”
63319	63328	63285	63285	She	2105	“ The best cubic zirconia money can buy ? ”
63329	63343	63285	63285	She	2105	“ Exactly . Believe me , he ’s spending enough on this trip . ”
63344	63353	63247	63247	Millie	2105	“ How ’s everything going with you two ? ”
63354	63357	63285	63285	She	2105	“ Great . ”
63358	63370	63285	63285	She	2105	“ Are the rumors true ? Did he tie you up ? ”
63371	63378	63247	63247	Millie	2105	“ Maybe , and not yet . ”
63379	63384	63385	63385	I	441	“ Wait , what ? ”
63401	63425	63426	63426	She	2105	“ I think there is some truth to those rumors , but he has n’t really shown me that side of himself yet . ”
63429	63436	63437	63437	I	441	“ So would you let him ? ”
63443	63469	63437	63437	I	441	“ I have to go because we ’re leaving in like twenty minutes and I still do n’t know what I ’m going to wear . ”
63470	63478	63519	63519	her	2105	“ Do you have a safe word ? ”
63479	63482	63437	63437	I	441	“ Millie ! ”
63483	63489	63437	63437	I	441	“ I suggest something else . ”
63490	63499	63519	63519	her	2105	“ I do n’t need a safe word . ”
63500	63508	63437	63437	I	441	“ Oklahoma . Bumblebee . Roy Kent . ”
63509	63514	63515	63515	I	441	“ Goodbye , Millie . ”
63625	63652	63612	63612	Hutton	148	“ Hey , I have to run down to the business center for a fax from Wade . I ’ll be back in a few minutes . ”
63661	63664	63653	63653	I	441	“ Okay . ”
63923	63926	63927	63927	I	441	“ Hi , ”
63939	63942	63930	63930	He	148	“ Jesus . ”
63943	63950	63935	63935	his	148	“ Is that good or bad ? ”
63951	63965	63966	63966	I	441	“ You took my breath away . I ’d say that ’s good . ”
63969	63978	63979	63979	He	148	“ Thank you . You look very handsome . ”
64038	64047	64007	64007	He	148	“ I feel like I should have shaved . ”
64048	64061	64064	64064	he	148	“ Nah , I like the scruff . Gives you some edge . ”
64074	64077	64064	64064	he	148	“ Thanks . ”
64078	64083	64084	64084	I	441	“ Should we go ? ”
64090	64095	64084	64084	I	441	“ Our reservation is — ”
64096	64101	64102	64102	He	148	“ Just a minute . ”
64121	64124	64125	64125	He	148	“ Hutton . ”
64153	64156	64145	64145	I	441	“ Hutton . ”
64157	64160	64145	64145	I	441	“ Yes . ”
64161	64174	64145	64145	I	441	“ Tell me that is not the ring I tried on today . ”
64175	64186	64187	64187	I	441	“ That is not the ring you tried on today . ”
64200	64212	64187	64187	I	441	“ Liar ! You said we were leaving without the ring ! ”
64213	64238	64145	64145	I	441	“ We did . This one came from another store . It has a stone with better clarity . That one had a blemish . ”
64239	64243	64244	64244	I	441	“ A blemish ? ”
64247	64250	64244	64244	I	441	“ Yes . ”
64251	64254	64255	64255	I	441	“ Hutton . ”
64260	64298	64255	64255	I	441	“ Tell me this is only on loan , like the necklace was in the movie . Remember ? Richard Gere does not actually purchase the necklace for her . He only borrows it for the night . ”
64299	64311	64312	64312	He	148	“ Richard Gere ’s not a real billionaire . I am . ”
64328	64334	64335	64335	I	441	“ Will you wear it ? ”
64354	64359	64360	64360	I	441	“ Oh , God , ”
64372	64387	64360	64360	I	441	“ I want to , I really do — but it ’s too much . ”
64388	64397	64398	64398	He	148	“ It ’s just a gift , Felicity . ”
64411	64419	64398	64398	He	148	“ Let me give you a gift . ”
64420	64424	64425	64425	My	441	“ For what ? ”
64439	64451	64425	64425	My	441	“ I do n’t need a gift for being your friend . ”
64452	64475	64398	64398	He	148	“ It ’s not really for anything . It ’s a symbol of our friendship . It ’s a gesture of appreciation . ”
64476	64479	64480	64480	I	441	“ Huttonnnnn , ”
64491	64514	64515	64515	He	148	“ A gesture of appreciation is a latte or a sandwich . This is a diamond ring . It ’s too much . ”
64537	64541	64542	64542	he	148	“ I understand , ”
64546	64592	64542	64542	he	148	“ that this is unusual . I know most people do n’t gift diamond rings to their friends — it ’s traditionally something reserved for the one person you ’re going to spend your life with . Your soul mate . But you know what ? ”
64593	64596	64597	64597	He	148	“ What ? ”
64605	64669	64597	64597	He	148	“ At the risk of sounding a little crazy , my mom taught me that there are all kinds of soul mates — past - life soul mates , kindred spirits , soul ties . . . She thinks there are certain people you just feel a deep , extraordinary connection with , and it transcends time and place as we know it . ”
64670	64675	64676	64676	I	441	“ I believe that , ”
64697	64754	64755	64755	My	441	“ So think of this as a symbol of that connection . Because even though we are n’t getting married , you are the person I cherish most , someone I will always want in my life . In fact , I feel one hundred percent certain our friendship will outlast all of Wade ’s marriages . ”
64776	64824	64825	64825	His	148	“ This is n’t a real proposal , because this is n’t a real engagement . But I thought maybe we could have one real thing to celebrate our friendship and the way we show up for each other . Something that will outlast this fake engagement . ”
64835	64844	64832	64832	he	148	“ And honestly , I can afford it . ”
64866	64888	64856	64856	Hutton	148	“ If you never want to wear the ring , you do n’t have to . But will you accept it ? ”
64898	64901	64889	64889	I	441	“ Okay . ”
64902	64905	64906	64906	He	148	“ Good . ”
64914	64919	64906	64906	He	148	“ Let ’s go . ”
64954	64983	64944	64944	I	441	“ You know , I ’ve never been the girl who craves fancy , shiny things , but I am head over heels in love with this ring . ”
64984	64987	64944	64944	I	441	“ Good . ”
64988	64992	64993	64993	I	441	“ But Hutton . ”
65007	65018	65019	65019	He	148	“ No more expensive surprises , okay ? Promise me . ”
65025	65036	65019	65019	He	148	“ That ’s no fun . I like treating you . ”
65037	65054	65055	65055	He	148	“ But this is all one - sided ! How am I going to treat you ? ”
65071	65076	65077	65077	My	441	“ We ’ll talk . ”
65129	65133	65134	65134	Hutton	148	“ Another time , ”
65137	65152	65134	65134	Hutton	148	“ I ’ll make sure you get to taste it before we go home . ”
65180	65189	65190	65190	I	441	“ Do you know where the seats are ? ”
65211	65215	65216	65216	Hutton	148	“ Not exactly . ”
65235	65242	65243	65243	I	441	“ Here . Let me see . ”
65303	65308	65309	65309	I	441	“ Wait a minute . ”
65313	65320	65309	65309	I	441	“ Are all these seats ours ? ”
65321	65330	65331	65331	Hutton	148	“ Yes . I bought the whole box , ”
65334	65339	65340	65340	I	441	“ I like privacy . ”
65343	65350	65351	65351	He	148	“ One of those billionaire perks ? ”
65354	65357	65351	65351	He	148	“ Exactly . ”
65414	65424	65405	65405	I	441	“ This is amazing ! It ’s so beautiful ! ”
65425	65429	65430	65430	Hutton	148	“ It is . ”
65436	65444	65430	65430	Hutton	148	“ Do you come here a lot ? ”
65445	65469	65405	65405	I	441	“ Not really . I brought my parents here once — my dad likes opera — and I attended the fundraising gala once . ”
65470	65489	65490	65490	He	148	“ Oooh , I bet that was fancy . Ball gowns and tuxes ? Cocktails and small talk ? ”
65493	65500	65501	65501	I	441	“ I lasted about twenty minutes . ”
65508	65524	65501	65501	I	441	“ Well , do n’t worry . I wo n’t make you talk to me . ”
65525	65536	65537	65537	My	441	“ I like talking to you . Among other things . ”
65697	65704	65705	65705	I	441	“ The dancers were so graceful , ”
65708	65760	65705	65705	I	441	“ So elegant and artistic but also strong and powerful . It ’s amazing how much emotion they can convey just by moving their arms a certain way . Or changing the angle of their head . They have such incredible command of every muscle in their bodies , you know ? ”
65761	65764	65765	65765	he	148	“ Yes , ”
65800	65812	65787	65787	him	148	“ Sorry ! I ’m talking nonstop , are n’t I ? ”
65813	65819	65705	65705	I	441	“ I do n’t mind . ”
65820	65829	65787	65787	him	148	“ I just loved it all so much . ”
65830	65844	65787	65787	him	148	“ I ’m glad . Want something to drink ? Whiskey or scotch ? ”
65845	65860	65705	65705	I	441	“ No , thanks . Mostly I just want to take these heels off . ”
65861	65866	65867	65867	I	441	“ Leave them on . ”
65893	65896	65878	65878	I	441	“ What ? ”
65897	65907	65908	65908	I	441	“ Leave them on . And come over here . ”
65917	65924	65908	65908	I	441	“ On your hands and knees . ”
66023	66027	66028	66028	he	148	“ Good girl , ”
66042	66047	66028	66028	he	148	“ Now come here . ”
66236	66241	66233	66233	his	971	“ Are you okay ? ”
66242	66245	66233	66233	his	971	“ Yes . ”
66246	66263	66264	66264	He	971	“ If there ’s a point tonight where you are not , you should tell me . ”
66276	66282	66272	66272	I	441	“ Like a safe word ? ”
66301	66309	66291	66291	His	971	“ You already have a safe word ? ”
66310	66313	66314	66314	I	441	“ No , ”
66318	66326	66314	66314	I	441	“ I ’ve never needed one before . ”
66327	66332	66333	66333	He	971	“ You do now . ”
66339	66346	66333	66333	He	971	“ So what will it be ? ”
66362	66366	66367	66367	I	441	“ Roy Kent , ”
66382	66388	66370	66370	He	971	“ Who ’s Roy Kent ? ”
66389	66393	66397	66397	Millie	2105	“ Never mind . ”
66399	66407	66397	66397	Millie	2105	“ I ’ll think of another one . ”
66426	66429	66430	66430	I	441	“ Romeo , ”
66434	66444	66430	66430	I	441	“ That ’s what I ’ll say . Romeo . ”
66470	66477	66464	66464	I	441	“ Is anything going to hurt ? ”
66498	66519	66464	66464	I	441	“ I do n’t need to inflict pain to feel in control , if that ’s what you ’re asking . ”
66520	66526	66535	66535	he	971	“ Okay . Should I — ”
66555	66597	66598	66598	I	441	“ Shhh . From now on , you do n’t speak until I ask a question . You do n’t move unless I tell you how . You do n’t come until I give you permission . Nod if you understand . ”
66712	66723	66707	66707	he	971	“ You do n’t move unless I tell you to . ”
66753	66761	66744	66744	He	971	“ Good girl . You learn quickly . ”
66787	66792	66793	66793	he	971	“ You surprise me , ”
66807	66840	66793	66793	he	971	“ All night I ’ve been hard thinking about what you might be wearing under that dress . But I never imagined this . I like it , especially with those shoes . ”
66867	66891	66858	66858	his	971	“ Those heels have been driving me crazy all night . I want to do such bad things to you in those heels . ”
66979	66992	66965	66965	He	971	“ Do you want to watch me do bad things to you ? ”
67004	67011	66993	66993	I	441	“ You can answer the question . ”
67012	67015	67016	67016	I	441	“ Yes , ”
67019	67024	67016	67016	I	441	“ Yes , what ? ”
67025	67039	67040	67040	I	441	“ Yes , I want to watch you do bad things to me . ”
67078	67084	67085	67085	he	971	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
67097	67114	67070	67070	he	971	“ So sweet . So polite . Like a princess . And you smell so good . ”
67268	67271	67272	67272	His	971	“ No . ”
67284	67293	67278	67278	he	971	“ That ’s breaking a rule , princess . ”
67301	67321	67294	67294	He	971	“ You do n’t move unless I tell you to . But I can help you remember to obey . ”
67606	67612	67601	67601	his	971	“ You ’re wet already . ”
67613	67616	67617	67617	I	441	“ Yes , ”
67627	67664	67620	67620	He	971	“ That was n’t a question . But since you ’re having such a hard time staying quiet , I ’ll give you permission to speak . Do you want to watch me make you come ? ”
67692	67696	67697	67697	he	971	“ Say it , ”
67700	67710	67711	67711	I	441	“ I want to watch you make me come , ”
67727	67750	67714	67714	He	971	“ The taste of you . That ’s another thing that drives me crazy . I ca n’t stop thinking about it . ”
67759	67767	67768	67768	He	971	“ I want it all the time . ”
67936	67940	67941	67941	he	971	“ Not yet , ”
68055	68062	68063	68063	he	971	“ Do n’t close your eyes , ”
68066	68069	68063	68063	he	971	“ Watch . ”
68126	68131	68132	68132	he	971	“ You ’re perfect , ”
68142	68148	68132	68132	he	971	“ You ’re fucking perfect . ”
68182	68185	68186	68186	he	971	“ Yes , ”
68196	68204	68205	68205	He	971	“ I want you just like this . ”
68307	68312	68313	68313	he	971	“ Such bad things , ”
68378	68382	68383	68383	Hutton	148	“ Fuck yes . ”
68491	68494	68495	68495	I	441	“ Hutton , ”
68498	68507	68495	68495	I	441	“ I want to feel you inside me . ”
68508	68516	68517	68517	He	148	“ I want that too , princess . ”
68525	68564	68517	68517	He	148	“ I want my cock right here . I want to make you come again . But this is a game about patience . About control . We ca n’t just give in to every urge we feel . ”
68565	68568	68569	68569	I	441	“ Romeo , ”
68572	68579	68580	68580	He	148	“ Now can we give in ? ”
68583	68601	68580	68580	He	148	“ It does n’t work like that . It ’s a safe word , not a password . ”
68602	68610	68611	68611	My	441	“ But I want you so badly . ”
68631	68645	68619	68619	I	441	“ I ’ve never wanted anyone this way . I have no control . ”
68646	68655	68656	68656	He	148	“ You do n’t have to have control . ”
68676	68689	68690	68690	I	441	“ You have to surrender it . That ’s what I like . ”
68708	68716	68700	68700	he	148	“ Surrender is harder than I thought . ”
68717	68723	68724	68724	He	148	“ I know it is . ”
68730	68758	68724	68724	He	148	“ But you ’re doing so well , princess . You ’re such a good girl , and I ’m going to give you what you want . ”
68759	68763	68764	68764	I	441	“ You are ? ”
68805	68808	68809	68809	he	148	“ Yes , ”
68812	68823	68809	68809	he	148	“ But you have to tell me what that is . ”
68824	68832	68833	68833	I	441	“ I want you to fuck me , ”
68842	68855	68838	68838	He	148	“ What happened to my sweet princess ? Where are her manners ? ”
68856	68866	68867	68867	I	441	“ I want you to fuck me , please ? ”
68870	68875	68876	68876	He	148	“ That ’s better . ”
68940	68943	68944	68944	he	148	“ Fuck , ”
68947	68963	68944	68944	he	148	“ It ’s so tight . So hot . And you look so fucking good . ”
69058	69063	69064	69064	he	148	“ Come for me , ”
69067	69092	69064	69064	he	148	“ Come right now , on my cock . On my fingers . Let me feel it . Then I ’ll come for you . ”
69093	69096	69097	69097	I	441	“ Yes ! ”
69236	69241	69242	69242	I	441	“ Oh my God , ”
69245	69253	69242	69242	I	441	“ That was — oh my God . ”
69268	69300	69257	69257	Hutton	148	“ I did n’t have a condom . That ’s why I did it that way . Although truth be told , that ’s what I wanted to do to you . ”
69301	69306	69307	69307	He	148	“ I liked it . ”
69315	69331	69307	69307	He	148	“ I ’ll clean you up . Give me a second to grab a towel . ”
69332	69338	69257	69257	Hutton	148	“ Okay , but Hutton ? ”
69339	69342	69307	69307	He	148	“ Yes ? ”
69343	69357	69307	69307	He	148	“ Can you take my shoes off ? My feet are killing me . ”
69378	69382	69383	69383	I	441	“ Thank you . ”
69420	69436	69399	69399	He	148	“ There . But do n’t move too much . You ’re a little messy . ”
69451	69456	69457	69457	He	148	“ It ’s okay . ”
69483	69513	69474	69474	he	148	“ You might still be a little sticky . And I also got some , uh , stuff in your hair . Want to take a shower or something ? ”
69514	69517	69518	69518	I	441	“ Maybe . ”
69534	69543	69529	69529	I	441	“ Actually yes , that might feel good . ”
69544	69552	69553	69553	I	441	“ Let me run it for you . ”
69556	69571	69553	69553	I	441	“ You do n’t have to do that . You did n’t break me . ”
69572	69579	69580	69580	He	148	“ It ’s not an apology . ”
69585	69594	69580	69580	He	148	“ I just like doing things for you . ”
69658	69672	69646	69646	He	148	“ It ’s nice , but it ’s not as good as yours . ”
69673	69684	69685	69685	I	441	“ I brought some lotion in the scent you like , ”
69689	69698	69685	69685	I	441	“ I ’ll put it on before bed . ”
69803	69807	69808	69808	he	148	“ Come here , ”
69819	69827	69808	69808	he	148	“ I have a surprise for you . ”
69828	69832	69833	69833	I	441	“ You do ? ”
69865	69877	69860	69860	Hutton	148	“ Tada ! Warm chocolate cake with raspberry creamsicle ice cream . ”
69888	69895	69878	69878	I	441	“ You made a phone call ! ”
69896	69903	69860	69860	Hutton	148	“ I made a phone call . ”
69904	69915	69916	69916	He	148	“ How did you get it up here so fast ? ”
69919	69926	69916	69916	He	148	“ I paid a little extra . ”
69927	69940	69878	69878	I	441	“ It looks so good , I bet it ’s worth it . ”
69941	69948	69949	69949	I	441	“ Your reaction is worth it . ”
69954	69987	69988	69988	He	148	“ You ’re spoiling me way too much on this trip . I ’m going to be terrible to live with . You ’ll be glad you ’re going back to California . ”
69991	69995	69988	69988	He	148	“ Sit down . ”
70032	70037	70038	70038	I	441	“ What ’s this ? ”
70054	70065	70041	70041	he	148	“ It ’s a combination of dessert and foot massage . ”
70128	70141	70142	70142	He	148	“ God , this is insane . I might have another orgasm . ”
70145	70152	70153	70154	FOURTEEN HUTTON	148	“ That would be okay too . ”
70155	70159	70160	70160	she	989	“ Your turn , ”
70164	70169	70153	70154	FOURTEEN HUTTON	148	“ Tell me something . ”
70170	70180	70181	70181	I	441	“ What do you want to know this time ? ”
70199	70224	70153	70154	FOURTEEN HUTTON	148	“ If you could do anything else with your life , like if it had gone in another direction , where would you be ? ”
70400	70439	70440	70440	I	441	“ You ca n’t think of anything ? I guess that ’s what it ’s like being a hot billionaire . You ’ve reached the zenith . There ’s nowhere else to go . Nothing else to achieve . ”
70443	70446	70440	70440	I	441	“ Hardly . ”
70447	70470	70471	70471	I	441	“ Okay , so then what ? Like , let ’s say you never created that algorithm . What would you be ? ”
70477	70484	70471	70471	I	441	“ Okay . Do n’t laugh . ”
70485	70490	70440	70440	I	441	“ I would never ! ”
70491	70507	70471	70471	I	441	“ I ’d have liked to teach math . Like be a professor or something . ”
70508	70521	70471	70471	I	441	“ I could see that . You ’d be great at it . ”
70522	70543	70440	70440	I	441	“ Uh , standing at the front of a room with everyone watching me ? I do n’t think so . ”
70544	70567	70471	70471	I	441	“ Yes , you would . You were a great tutor back in the day — those middle school kids loved you . ”
70568	70627	70471	70471	I	441	“ That was one on one . Teaching a class is very different . You have to be on every single minute . You have to explain things exactly right , you ca n’t get a single word wrong . If you say something in error , you look like you do n’t know what you ’re doing . ”
70628	70644	70440	70440	I	441	“ I ’m not saying being a teacher is easy or does n’t take preparation . ”
70645	70716	70717	70717	She	995	“ It does n’t matter how prepared I am . I could plan a lecture , rehearse it a thousand times , bring notes into the classroom with me , and still second guess myself to the point where I ’m standing up there sweating and shaking , unable to even read my own writing because a hundred pairs of eyes are on me waiting for me to fuck up . ”
70724	70730	70717	70717	She	995	“ Did this actually happen ? ”
70731	70734	70471	70471	I	441	“ Yeah . ”
70735	70738	70717	70717	She	995	“ When ? ”
70739	70768	70717	70717	She	995	“ A couple years ago , I was invited to give a guest lecture at M.I.T. to one of my mentor teachers ’ classes , and I bombed . ”
70769	70775	70471	70471	I	441	“ Your mentor said that ? ”
70776	70838	70717	70717	She	995	“ No . But I knew she thought that . And I knew every kid in that room was like , ‘ who is this fucking hack and why does he make billions of dollars when he ca n’t even form a coherent sentence or write on the board without staring at every problem wondering if he wrote it right ? ’ ”
70839	70852	70853	70853	I	441	“ Wow . That ’s so cool that you can read minds . ”
70858	70866	70853	70853	I	441	“ That ’s what it felt like . ”
70867	70870	70871	70871	She	995	“ Sorry . ”
70875	70903	70871	70871	She	995	“ But if I do n’t call you out on this stuff , who will ? It ’s like Winnie with the Wicked Witch of the West . ”
70904	70907	70853	70853	I	441	“ Huh ? ”
70908	71001	71002	71002	She	58	“ Everyone in my family always wanted to watch the Wizard of Oz , but that witch scared the bejesus out of Winnie . She would hide under a blanket every time the witch came onscreen . But then Frannie bought us a nonfiction book about witches . We learned the truth about where the idea behind evil witches came from , and how female healers and priestesses were accused of getting their magic powers from the devil when really , it was just terrible men trying to suppress women ’s influence . ”
71010	71017	71018	71018	I	441	“ Sorry for all terrible men , ”
71022	71053	71054	71054	She	58	“ Apology accepted . Anyway , I think your fears are based on something you ’re guessing at rather than something you know for sure . Just like a witch . ”
71068	71079	71054	71054	She	58	“ Not real . Feels real , but is n’t . ”
71080	71109	71110	71110	She	58	“ Okay , but that does n’t make my nerves any better . The thoughts are still there . And they cause physical reactions I ca n’t hide . ”
71116	71148	71149	71149	I	441	“ Would you consider trying therapy again ? This is going to make me sad that you have a dream to teach but wo n’t do it because of the witch . ”
71152	71175	71149	71149	I	441	“ My sister wants me to try acceptance and commitment therapy . There ’s a woman in her practice who does it . ”
71176	71188	71149	71149	I	441	“ Can you get in to see her before you leave ? ”
71189	71195	71149	71149	I	441	“ It wo n’t work . ”
71196	71202	71203	71203	She	58	“ How do you know ? ”
71207	71222	71203	71203	She	58	“ This is something new , right ? An approach you ’ve never tried ? ”
71223	71228	71229	71229	I	441	“ Does n’t matter , ”
71233	71239	71240	71240	She	58	“ It wo n’t work . ”
71248	71264	71240	71240	She	58	“ You can read minds and predict the future . Maybe you ’re the witch ! ”
71299	71320	71291	71291	I	441	“ Enough . I ’m set in my ways and not going to change . Take me or leave me . ”
71321	71348	71349	71349	I	441	“ I never want you to change , Hutton . I ’ll always take you . I just wish you could see yourself like I do . ”
71524	71527	71528	71528	Felicity	148	“ Hutton . ”
71535	71547	71528	71528	Felicity	148	“ Tell me some of these guesses are way too high . ”
71553	71563	71548	71548	I	441	“ I ’m not even looking at that bullshit . ”
71613	71627	71628	71628	Felicity	148	“ Wow . People just say what they think , do n’t they ? ”
71639	71650	71628	71628	Felicity	148	“ How do you deal with this all the time ? ”
71663	71676	71651	71651	I	441	“ Fuck the internet . What would you like to do today ? ”
71677	71699	71700	71700	She	560	“ I ’d love to sightsee a little bit , but will people be following us everywhere trying to get pictures ? ”
71705	71732	71700	71700	She	560	“ I feel weird about that . I ’m not Zlatka , and people expect a supermodel , or at least someone with symmetrical hair and — ”
71733	71736	71737	71737	I	441	“ Hey . ”
71750	71787	71737	71737	I	441	“ I can not tell you how happy I am that you are not Zlatka . You are superior to her in every way . You are beautiful inside and out , and you are real . ”
71788	71791	71793	71793	her	560	“ Thanks . ”
71798	71823	71793	71793	her	560	“ I guess I ’m stupid . I did n’t foresee this problem . But why would a billionaire choose a girl like me ? ”
71865	71892	71835	71835	she	560	“ Listen to me . You are way too good for every billionaire I ’ve ever met , and that includes me . Fuck those people . ”
71893	71915	71916	71916	I	441	“ I ’ve never worried about , like , leaving my house before . It ’s kind of a shitty feeling . ”
71928	71948	71916	71916	I	441	“ Being in the public eye is really fucking hard . Especially when you did n’t ask for it . ”
71949	71956	71835	71835	she	560	“ How do you handle it ? ”
71957	71986	71987	71987	I	441	“ I do n’t leave the house much . But I ’m sorry I dragged you into this fucked - up orbit . I should have known better . ”
71990	71996	71997	71997	She	560	“ Want to head home ? ”
72026	72049	72050	72050	I	441	“ No . You ’re right — fuck those people . They ca n’t steal our joy . Our fake engagement joy . ”
72053	72057	72050	72050	I	441	“ Damn right . ”
72058	72067	72068	72068	she	560	“ We ’re only here one more day , ”
72077	72093	72068	72068	she	560	“ I want to do things . If we hide out , the jerks win . ”
72094	72117	72050	72050	I	441	“ You tell me what you want to do , and I ’ll do it . Even if there ’s a crowd . ”
72118	72128	72050	72050	I	441	“ Nothing too fancy . How about the zoo ? ”
72129	72132	72068	72068	she	560	“ Done . ”
72133	72157	72050	72050	I	441	“ But cancel the driver , okay ? Let ’s just walk . I do n’t want to call any attention to us . ”
72158	72162	72163	72163	We	1001	“ Good idea . ”
72199	72202	72203	72203	I	441	“ Ready ? ”
72219	72222	72213	72213	She	560	“ Ready . ”
72307	72319	72300	72300	She	560	“ Do n’t worry , I left it in the safe . ”
72320	72325	72293	72293	she	560	“ That ’s fine . ”
72326	72359	72360	72360	Her	560	“ It ’s not because I do n’t love it or I feel strange wearing it . I just did n’t want anyone recognizing us . The ring seemed like a giveaway . ”
72376	72381	72366	72366	she	560	“ I ’m sorry . ”
72382	72390	72392	72392	I	441	“ Do n’t be . I understand . ”
72403	72423	72424	72424	She	560	“ You can wear it or not wear it whenever you want . That ring is yours , Felicity . ”
72427	72430	72431	72431	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
72492	72496	72497	72497	I	441	“ Now what ? ”
72507	72510	72511	72511	She	560	“ Shopping ? ”
72523	72536	72511	72511	She	560	“ I ’d like to find a dress for our engagement party . ”
72537	72546	72556	72556	she	560	“ That ’s what the internet is for . ”
72547	72555	72556	72556	she	560	“ You do n’t have to come , ”
72561	72611	72556	72556	she	560	“ You can go back to the hotel if you want and I ’ll meet you back there later . I get it — I’m not a huge shopper either , I just want to find something unique and stylish . Winnie told me to try NoLita or Soho . ”
72612	72617	72618	72618	I	441	“ It ’s fine . ”
72622	72628	72618	72618	I	441	“ I ’ll go shopping . ”
72629	72632	72633	72633	She	560	“ Okay . ”
72649	72681	72682	72682	I	441	“ But to be clear , you are not buying me anything . Your job is just to stand there and tell me how things look when I try them on . ”
72685	72695	72682	72682	I	441	“ I have to go in to the stores ? ”
72696	72699	72682	72682	I	441	“ Yes . ”
72700	72712	72682	72682	I	441	“ Is it too late to go back to the hotel ? ”
72713	72716	72717	72717	She	560	“ Yes . ”
72732	72743	72717	72717	She	560	“ But I promise it wo n’t be that bad . ”
72856	72861	72862	72862	I	441	“ It looks great , ”
72871	72877	72862	72862	I	441	“ You should get it . ”
72878	72889	72862	72862	I	441	“ Hutton , you did n’t even look at it . ”
72890	72893	72894	72894	I	441	“ Sorry . ”
72907	72912	72913	72913	She	560	“ I like it . ”
72921	72929	72913	72913	She	560	“ What about it do you like ? ”
72930	72935	72936	72936	I	441	“ The . . . ”
72943	72947	72948	72948	She	560	“ Frilly things . ”
72953	72956	72948	72948	She	560	“ Thanks . ”
72957	72963	72964	72964	I	441	“ Can I wait outside ? ”
72973	72976	72964	72964	I	441	“ Why ? ”
72977	73001	73002	73002	Felicity	148	“ Because I feel weird . People are staring . They think I ’m a pervert here to spy on women changing clothes . ”
73019	73025	73026	73026	I	441	“ Yeah . I know , ”
73032	73038	73029	73029	She	560	“ You can wait outside . ”
73063	73072	73053	73053	She	560	“ You did n’t want to buy it ? ”
73073	73076	73053	73053	She	560	“ Nah . ”
73077	73081	73053	73053	She	560	“ Why not ? ”
73082	73090	73091	73091	I	441	“ It was expensive , and I — ”
73098	73104	73091	73091	I	441	“ I ’ve got it . ”
73105	73110	73111	73111	She	560	“ Hutton , no . ”
73116	73129	73111	73111	She	560	“ It was n’t right anyway . I did n’t love it . ”
73130	73142	73091	73091	I	441	“ Are you sure ? Or are you just saying that ? ”
73143	73148	73149	73149	She	560	“ I ’m sure . ”
73154	73163	73164	73164	We	1020	“ Come on , let ’s keep going . ”
73179	73184	73175	73175	she	560	“ Oh , look . ”
73217	73223	73175	73175	she	560	“ Are those wedding gowns ? ”
73224	73229	73230	73230	she	560	“ I think so , ”
73234	73240	73230	73230	she	560	“ Are n’t they pretty ? ”
73252	73258	73259	73259	She	560	“ Go try one on . ”
73264	73269	73259	73259	She	560	“ I could n’t . ”
73270	73278	73259	73259	She	560	“ Why not ? Just for fun . ”
73279	73292	73259	73259	She	560	“ No , because what if I fall in love for real ? ”
73293	73300	73259	73259	She	560	“ Would that be so bad ? ”
73301	73329	73259	73259	She	560	“ Yes ! I do n’t want to try something on for fun , get my heart set on it , and then have to walk away . ”
73330	73335	73336	73336	I	441	“ You wo n’t , ”
73344	73348	73336	73336	I	441	“ Come on . ”
73349	73354	73355	73355	She	560	“ Hutton , wait . ”
73373	73380	73355	73355	She	560	“ Why are we doing this ? ”
73381	73387	73336	73336	I	441	“ What do you mean ? ”
73388	73415	73416	73416	She	560	“ The ring was one thing . Like you said , a symbol of our friendship . And it ’s something I can wear every day . ”
73425	73435	73416	73416	She	560	“ I ’ll never wear one of those dresses . ”
73436	73442	73355	73355	She	560	“ How do you know ? ”
73443	73480	73416	73416	She	560	“ I guess I do n’t know for sure , but it seems like a good way to jinx myself — buy a wedding dress when I have no idea if I ’ll ever get married . ”
73507	73517	73502	73502	I	441	“ What about wearing it at our engagement party ? ”
73518	73523	73502	73502	I	441	“ A wedding gown ? ”
73524	73541	73542	73542	She	560	“ You do n’t have to get a big fluffy one . Get something more simple . ”
73549	73555	73542	73542	She	560	“ I do n’t know . ”
73556	73565	73566	73566	I	441	“ Cosette Lavigne sounds like a French name , ”
73569	73583	73584	73584	Felicity	148	“ Was n’t that what you told Mimi ? Your dress was French ? ”
73587	73593	73584	73584	Felicity	148	“ I did say that . ”
73594	73605	73606	73606	She	560	“ Then it ’s meant to be . Come on . ”
73649	73657	73660	73660	I	441	“ Hello . Can I help you ? ”
73675	73684	73685	73685	she	560	“ I’m — I’m looking for a dress , ”
73694	73699	73688	73689	The woman	560	“ A wedding dress ? ”
73700	73711	73712	73712	She	560	“ No . I mean , yes , but no . ”
73723	73735	73736	73737	The woman	560	“ Sorry . The dress would be for an engagement party . ”
73744	73757	73736	73737	The woman	560	“ Wonderful . Congratulations . Did you have a style in mind ? ”
73758	73794	73736	73737	The woman	560	“ Something a little more casual than what ’s in the window . White is fine , but no ball gown or long train or anything . The party is outdoors , on a patio . ”
73795	73807	73736	73737	The woman	560	“ And will you need to leave with the dress today ? ”
73808	73811	73812	73812	she	560	“ Yes , ”
73815	73832	73833	73834	The woman	560	“ We ’re going home tomorrow . But if you do n’t have anything , I — ”
73848	73898	73840	73840	she	560	“ I have something . We ’ll need to go off the rack , of course , but I ’m seeing something short , perhaps tulle with pearl beading , something to emphasize your waistline , maybe a full skirt , a statement sleeve . Give me a moment . ”
73899	73903	73904	73905	The woman	560	“ Thank you . ”
73919	73928	73929	73929	I	441	“ What the hell is a statement sleeve ? ”
73932	73940	73929	73929	I	441	“ Is this dress going to talk ? ”
73941	73954	73929	73929	I	441	“ I think it means the sleeves will be big and dramatic . ”
73955	73958	73929	73929	I	441	“ Interesting . ”
74045	74053	74054	74055	The saleswoman	1029	“ Like it was made for you . ”
74066	74080	74057	74057	Olga	192	“ It does n’t even need alteration , I ca n’t believe it . ”
74081	74087	74088	74088	Felicity	148	“ It ’s so pretty , ”
74127	74147	74124	74125	Pebbles Flintstone	193	“ Let me see if I have a shoe for you to try on . What size are you ? ”
74148	74151	74153	74153	Felicity	148	“ Seven , ”
74155	74167	74153	74153	Felicity	148	“ But that ’s okay , I do n’t know if — ”
74168	74174	74175	74175	Olga	192	“ I ’ll be back . ”
74206	74212	74199	74199	Met	194	“ What do you think ? ”
74213	74230	74231	74231	I	441	“ I think we should get out of here while we can . This is nuts . ”
74243	74250	74251	74251	I	441	“ Or it makes perfect sense , ”
74257	74264	74265	74265	She	192	“ Both things can be true . ”
74270	74280	74265	74265	She	192	“ Not this time . It ’s too much . ”
74281	74286	74240	74240	she	192	“ Too much money ? ”
74287	74293	74265	74265	She	192	“ Just — too much . ”
74294	74300	74301	74301	She	192	“ What do you mean ? ”
74306	74333	74301	74301	She	192	“ I guess I ’m getting nervous that the line between real and make - believe is growing a little blurry . Know what I mean ? ”
74371	74380	74381	74381	She	192	“ Felicity , it ’s just a dress . ”
74391	74395	74396	74396	I	441	“ Is it ? ”
74405	74408	74401	74401	I	441	“ Yes . ”
74451	74454	74437	74437	she	192	“ Shoot ! ”
74474	74481	74482	74482	she	192	“ Get the dress off me ! ”
74545	74552	74553	74553	I	441	“ She has a bloody nose , ”
74556	74561	74553	74553	I	441	“ Can you help ? ”
74596	74603	74604	74604	Felicity	148	“ Should I call an ambulance ? ”
74609	74616	74618	74618	her	192	“ It ’s not that bad , ”
74622	74629	74618	74618	her	192	“ I can wait it out . ”
74630	74633	74634	74634	I	441	“ No , ”
74638	74649	74634	74634	I	441	“ She ’ll be fine . Is the dress okay ? ”
74650	74655	74656	74656	She	192	“ I think so . ”
74663	74693	74656	74656	She	192	“ No ! There is a spot of blood right here on the neckline ! It ’s faint , but I can see it . The dress is ruined . ”
74699	74709	74694	74694	I	441	“ Then I guess we have to buy it . ”
74713	74718	74694	74694	I	441	“ I ’m sorry . ”
74776	74781	74782	74782	I	441	“ Do n’t be . ”
74789	74796	74782	74782	I	441	“ This dress was too expensive . ”
74797	74803	74782	74782	I	441	“ It ’s worth it . ”
74804	74813	74782	74782	I	441	“ I bled all over your white shirt . ”
74814	74824	74782	74782	I	441	“ That ’s why I bought a black one . ”
74825	74831	74782	74782	I	441	“ I ’m so embarrassed . ”
74832	74844	74782	74782	I	441	“ You never have to be embarrassed in front of me . ”
74845	74848	74849	74849	She	192	“ No ? ”
74855	74888	74889	74889	She	192	“ No . I guarantee I ’ve made a way bigger fool of myself . Did I ever tell you about my road test when I was getting my driver ’s license ? ”
74894	74926	74927	74927	She	192	“ I had such a bad panic attack , I had to stop the car , get out , and walk home . It took me another month to try again . ”
74935	74941	74927	74927	She	192	“ I never knew that . ”
74942	74991	74927	74927	She	192	“ I was too ashamed to tell you . Then there was the time I took an F on a presentation in a college class because I got up to give it but instead of going to the front of the room , I walked out the door . ”
74992	75004	74927	74927	She	192	“ The teacher did n’t offer to let you redo it ? ”
75005	75035	74927	74927	She	192	“ Sure he did . I said no way . And then there was this girl I was kind of crazy about — I totally blew it with her . ”
75041	75045	74927	74927	She	192	“ What girl ? ”
75046	75060	75061	75061	She	192	“ This crazy smart , smokin ’ hot babe in the Chemistry Club . ”
75069	75077	75061	75061	She	192	“ Yeah ? What did you do ? ”
75078	75109	74927	74927	She	192	“ I worked up my nerve to ask her to the prom , but at the end of the night , I fucking shook her hand instead of kissing her . ”
75110	75117	74927	74927	She	192	“ Why ’d you do that ? ”
75118	75137	75061	75061	She	192	“ I was scared . I never thought she ’d want to be with a guy like me . ”
75138	75150	74927	74927	She	192	“ Smart ? Handsome ? Section leader of the marching band ? ”
75151	75161	74927	74927	She	192	“ I was a nerd with a filthy mind . ”
75162	75171	75172	75172	She	192	“ That ’s the best kind of nerd . ”
75180	75196	75172	75172	She	192	“ You should reach out . See if she ’ll give you a second chance . ”
75197	75202	75207	75207	We	1034	“ You think so ? ”
75203	75206	75207	75207	We	1034	“ Definitely . ”
75292	75299	75300	75300	Felicity	148	“ He ’s carrying her purse , ”
75303	75309	75300	75300	Felicity	148	“ How cute is that ? ”
75340	75344	75346	75347	the man	411	“ Thank you , ”
75366	75370	75346	75347	the man	411	“ Of course . ”
75379	75389	75371	75371	Felicity	148	“ It ’s a beautiful day for a walk . ”
75390	75407	75409	75410	the woman	600	“ Yes . We ’ve walked in this park just about every Saturday for seventy years , ”
75416	75429	75430	75430	I	441	“ I just ca n’t get as far as I used to . ”
75433	75441	75430	75430	I	441	“ That ’s what benches are for . ”
75442	75449	75450	75450	she	600	“ But it ’s our anniversary , ”
75454	75469	75450	75450	she	600	“ and I said , ‘ Edward , we have to walk today . ’ ”
75470	75474	75476	75476	Felicity	148	“ Happy anniversary ! ”
75478	75483	75476	75476	Felicity	148	“ How many years ? ”
75484	75506	75507	75508	the woman	600	“ Seventy - two . We moved here when I was expecting our first baby . We had eight of them , ”
75515	75528	75507	75508	the woman	600	“ That ’s a lot of years and a lot of babies . ”
75529	75535	75537	75537	Edward	196	“ Tell me about it , ”
75547	75555	75540	75540	he	196	“ How ’s the hip , Clara ? ”
75556	75568	75569	75569	She	600	“ A little rusty . I ’ll just rest a minute . ”
75579	75585	75569	75569	She	600	“ Are you two married ? ”
75605	75608	75609	75609	I	441	“ No , ”
75612	75620	75622	75622	Felicity	148	“ We ’re just very close friends , ”
75624	75633	75634	75634	Clara	197	“ It ’s so much harder these days , ”
75640	75679	75634	75634	Clara	197	“ Especially for women . The list of things my daughters and granddaughters wanted to accomplish before they got married was a mile long . But finding love is an accomplishment too . That ’s my two cents . ”
75685	75694	75680	75680	Edward	196	“ She ’s got two cents for everything . ”
75695	75711	75713	75714	his wife	600	“ I ’m ninety - three . I ’ve saved up a lot of pennies , ”
75717	75726	75727	75727	Felicity	148	“ Well , I think you ’re right . ”
75734	75741	75727	75727	Felicity	148	“ Finding love is an accomplishment . ”
75742	75751	75752	75752	Clara	197	“ Holding onto it is n’t easy either , ”
75756	75800	75752	75752	Clara	197	“ People make such a fuss about weddings these days , I think they forget that after the white dress and the I do ’s , there ’s a whole lot of hard work ahead . But that ’s just my two cents . ”
75801	75807	75809	75809	Edward	196	“ See what I mean ? ”
75814	75830	75832	75832	Clara	197	“ Anyway , I think the best marriages are the ones between two close friends , ”
75834	75891	75832	75832	Clara	197	“ That ’s what I was trying to say . Those are the ones that last , because you already know each other so well . You get along with each other . You appreciate things about the other person that you might not if it was just S - E - X all the time . ”
75898	75907	75892	75892	Felicity	148	“ Yes , I know what you mean . ”
75908	75918	75919	75919	Clara	197	“ Of course , if you can have both , ”
75924	75968	75919	75919	Clara	197	“ that ’s really the best of both worlds . If you can find that close friend that you love and trust , and the S - E - X is good too , that ’s when you know . Right , Eddie ? ”
75969	75972	75973	75973	He	196	“ Right . ”
75980	75998	75999	75999	Edward	196	“ Because one might fade , but the other ? Never . That ’s my two cents . ”
76002	76006	76007	76007	Felicity	148	“ Thank you , ”
76010	76015	76007	76007	Felicity	148	“ And happy anniversary . ”
76059	76063	76053	76053	Felicity	148	“ Everything okay ? ”
76079	76087	76068	76068	we	1047	“ Yes . I ’m just tired . ”
76088	76100	76101	76101	I	441	“ Are you too tired for S - E - X ? ”
76111	76114	76116	76116	she	197	“ No . ”
76138	76141	76116	76116	she	197	“ Hey . ”
76160	76166	76167	76167	She	197	“ What ’s going on ? ”
76194	76207	76183	76183	she	197	“ I keep thinking about that couple . Seventy - two years . ”
76208	76215	76183	76183	she	197	“ That ’s a long time . ”
76216	76250	76251	76251	She	197	“ I think about your parents . My dad and Frannie . Your sister and Neil . Even Winnie and Dex — you can just tell they ’re going to be together forever . ”
76257	76275	76251	76251	She	197	“ How do some people get so lucky , and others just . . . do n’t ? ”
76276	76285	76183	76183	she	197	“ Born under different stars , I guess . ”
76286	76290	76291	76291	she	197	“ I guess , ”
76295	76321	76322	76322	She	197	“ Hey , listen . Our stars might not come with seven - plus decades and eight kids , but they ’re not so bad . ”
76327	76330	76322	76322	She	197	“ No . ”
76341	76352	76322	76322	She	197	“ What do you say we do this every year ? ”
76353	76357	76251	76251	She	197	“ Do what ? ”
76358	76428	76322	76322	She	197	“ Meet up for a weekend in New York — or anywhere else in the world . I ’ll pick you up in a jet , we ’ll rent a hotel suite , eat at fancy places , see shows , go shopping , or even better , avoid people and do nothing at all . Just . . . be together . Like this . You and me . ”
76429	76434	76322	76322	She	197	“ That sounds nice . ”
76441	76448	76322	76322	She	197	“ You sure you ’re okay ? ”
76449	76454	76455	76455	I	441	“ I ’m fine . ”
76785	76794	76796	76796	Winnie	58	“ Nooooo ! You and those bloody noses ! ”
76798	76804	76796	76796	Winnie	58	“ Is the dress ruined ? ”
76805	76809	76810	76810	I	441	“ Not really , ”
76813	76821	76810	76810	I	441	“ You can hardly see the spot . ”
76822	76840	76842	76842	Millie	2105	“ I love that you had one fancy day and one day just dressed down for yourselves , ”
76847	76859	76844	76844	I	441	“ Me too . We had so much fun both nights . ”
76860	76866	76867	76867	Millie	2105	“ I bet you did . ”
76892	76904	76884	76884	she	2105	“ What ’s that look ? What do n’t I know ? ”
76905	76922	76923	76923	Winnie	58	“ I was just wondering if Felicity had to use a safe word in New York . ”
76929	76936	76923	76923	Winnie	58	“ Oh my God . What ? ”
76937	76943	76944	76944	Millie	2105	“ Did n’t you know ? ”
76950	76956	76944	76944	Millie	2105	“ Hutton has a kink . ”
76970	76994	76962	76962	she	2105	“ I can not believe you have been withholding this information from me , and I demand that you tell me everything immediately . ”
77007	77021	76995	76995	I	441	“ Listen . Do I ask you everything about Dex in the bedroom ? ”
77022	77032	77033	77033	I	441	“ No , but I tell you everything anyway . ”
77036	77050	77033	77033	I	441	“ Well , I ’m not like that . Some things are private . ”
77071	77080	77081	77081	Winnie	58	“ At least one little detail , please ? ”
77094	77112	77113	77113	Millie	2105	“ I did have a safe word . Although I do n’t think I used it correctly . ”
77118	77127	77128	77128	Winnie	58	“ Whatever you did , was it fun ? ”
77132	77138	77128	77128	Winnie	58	“ Did you like it ? ”
77139	77142	77143	77143	I	441	“ Yeah , ”
77146	77182	77143	77143	I	441	“ It was hot . I mean , I can see why some people would not like it , and it definitely takes a certain level of trust , but we had a good time . ”
77183	77192	77193	77193	Winnie	58	“ And he ’s okay with the party ? ”
77200	77203	77204	77204	Millie	2105	“ Winnie ! ”
77211	77220	77204	77204	Millie	2105	“ That is supposed to be a surprise . ”
77221	77224	77225	77225	Winnie	58	“ Ow ! ”
77230	77244	77225	77225	Winnie	58	“ She already knows , okay ? She dragged it out of me . ”
77245	77255	77256	77256	I	441	“ It was like shooting fish in a barrel . ”
77259	77282	77256	77256	I	441	“ But I was glad she told me . I ca n’t say he ’s thrilled , but we ’ll be there . ”
77283	77291	77292	77292	Winnie	58	“ And what about a wedding date ? ”
77297	77302	77292	77292	Winnie	58	“ Any progress there ? ”
77303	77316	77317	77317	Millie	2105	“ There ’s one Sunday afternoon available at the end of August , ”
77325	77333	77317	77317	Millie	2105	“ I have it reserved for now . ”
77334	77339	77340	77340	I	441	“ Thanks , Millie , ”
77343	77358	77340	77340	I	441	“ I promise to get you an answer in the next day or so . ”
77359	77377	77378	77378	Winnie	58	“ I hope so ! Invitations need to go out — that ’s only a month away . ”
77383	77414	77415	77415	I	441	“ Shoot . I have to go , I promised Hallie and Luna I ’d go swimming with them at eleven . Let me see the ring one more time ! ”
77431	77451	77422	77422	she	58	“ It ’s so beautiful . I ’m so happy for you . When do we talk bridesmaid dresses ? ”
77452	77457	77462	77462	Winnie	58	“ Uh . Soon . ”
77458	77461	77462	77462	Winnie	58	“ Yay ! ”
77476	77483	77462	77462	Winnie	58	“ Okay , I ’m going . ”
77495	77498	77488	77488	I	441	“ What ? ”
77499	77509	77510	77510	She	2105	“ A real wedding dress ? A real ring ? ”
77515	77540	77510	77510	She	2105	“ What ’s going on ? I ’m starting to wonder if the joke ’s on me . Maybe I should save the date . ”
77541	77555	77556	77556	I	441	“ We had to buy the dress because my nose bled on it , ”
77559	77584	77556	77556	I	441	“ It does n’t really look like a wedding gown . Just a party dress . And I even tried to pay for it . ”
77585	77591	77510	77510	She	2105	“ What about the ring ? ”
77592	77600	77601	77601	I	441	“ The ring was just a gift , ”
77614	77618	77619	77619	Millie	2105	“ A gift . ”
77624	77628	77619	77619	Millie	2105	“ From Tiffany . ”
77629	77693	77694	77694	I	441	“ Yes . Look , I know it ’s a bit extravagant , and I told him that , but he would n’t listen . He said he knows diamond rings are normally reserved for people you ’re asking to spend the rest of your life with , but since he knows he always wants me in his life , it ’s fine . ”
77703	77716	77694	77694	I	441	“ We ’re not really getting married , and it ’s fine . ”
77717	77722	77694	77694	I	441	“ It ’s fine ? ”
77723	77732	77694	77694	I	441	“ It ’s fine . I ’m fine . ”
77758	77770	77744	77744	Millie	2105	“ I do n’t think you are . What ’s wrong ? ”
77771	77774	77775	77775	I	441	“ Nothing . ”
77787	77812	77775	77775	I	441	“ I ’m tired is all . I did n’t get much sleep in New York , and I had to work last night . ”
77839	77842	77843	77843	I	441	“ What ? ”
77851	77863	77843	77843	I	441	“ I know you . Something has you nervous . Jumpy . ”
77864	77869	77870	77870	I	441	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
77888	77899	77876	77876	She	234	“ Did Hutton tell you he loves you or something ? ”
77900	77903	77904	77904	I	441	“ No ! ”
77914	77943	77944	77944	Millie	2105	“ Things are n’t like that with us . This is n’t a real relationship or a real engagement . It ’s something I made up , remember ? ”
77949	77953	77944	77944	Millie	2105	“ I remember . ”
77993	78028	77975	77976	a woman	352	“ I know it might look real on the outside , but that ’s just because we ’re having a good time . It ’s one hundred percent fake . We are not together . ”
78029	78035	78036	78036	she	2105	“ If you say so , ”
78039	78043	78036	78036	she	2105	“ I do . ”
78054	78060	78036	78036	she	2105	“ It ’s not real . ”
78229	78239	78266	78266	Mimi	412	“ the hometown honey that bagged herself a billionaire . ”
78416	78421	78422	78422	he	148	“ I ’m sorry , ”
78425	78472	78422	78422	he	148	“ It will seem like I do n’t care or like I ’m self - obsessed , but that ’s not it . When something like this is hanging over my head , I just get really focused . I ca n’t think about anything else . ”
78473	78478	78479	78479	I	441	“ I get it , ”
78483	78500	78501	78501	He	148	“ And you do n’t have to apologize or worry about me . Concentrate on you . ”
78718	78797	78705	78705	I	441	“ Felicity , darling , it ’s Mom . I heard the big news ! At first I just could n’t believe it — it seemed so unlikely for you — but I ’ve seen the photos and do n’t you two look cute together ? And wow , a billionaire . That ’s really something . I ’m sure your father is happy about that . He ’ll never have to worry about money again , right ? ”
78803	78825	78826	78826	I	441	“ Anyway , I ’m dying to talk to you . Give me a call , it ’s been too long . ”
78855	78860	78861	78861	I	441	“ Not long enough , ”
78887	78890	78891	78891	I	441	“ Nothing , ”
78916	78929	78900	78900	I	441	“ You ’ve been so quiet tonight . Actually , all week . ”
78930	78936	78937	78937	I	441	“ Have I ? Sorry . ”
78953	78960	78900	78900	I	441	“ Just tired , I guess . ”
78961	78964	78965	78965	He	148	“ Hey . ”
78985	79006	79007	79007	I	441	“ Talk to me . I know I ’m distracted with work , but I ’m still here for you . ”
79074	79082	79064	79064	I	441	“ It ’s nothing . I promise . ”
79116	79128	79129	79129	she	412	“ I just ca n’t wait to meet a real billionaire , ”
79132	79163	79129	79129	she	412	“ And I ’m dying to see that rock up close . It looks huge . Is he paying for out - of - town guests to stay somewhere nice ? ”
79292	79295	79283	79283	I	441	“ Hello ? ”
79296	79299	79300	79300	Carla	412	“ Finally , ”
79309	79320	79300	79300	Carla	412	“ I was wondering when I ’d actually get you . ”
79330	79336	79323	79323	I	441	“ What do you want ? ”
79337	79343	79283	79283	I	441	“ I want to talk . ”
79344	79348	79323	79323	I	441	“ About what ? ”
79349	79353	79354	79354	She	412	“ About life . ”
79358	79378	79354	79354	She	412	“ About this wedding thing . Why would you want to get married anyway ? You ’re too young . ”
79379	79389	79323	79323	I	441	“ Do you even know how old I am ? ”
79390	79396	79397	79397	she	412	“ Do n’t be rude , ”
79400	79407	79323	79323	I	441	“ I ’m still your mother . ”
79408	79415	79354	79354	She	412	“ When did you decide that ? ”
79416	79452	79453	79453	My	441	“ Hey . I ’m trynna do you a favor . I get wanting the money , but make sure he signs a prenup . You need to protect yourself for when he leaves you . ”
79457	79465	79453	79453	My	441	“ I do n’t need a prenup . ”
79466	79472	79473	79473	she	412	“ Yes , you do , ”
79476	79513	79473	79473	she	412	“ You think everything will be wine and roses , but it wo n’t . The good times do n’t last . He ’ll make promises he wo n’t keep , just like your father did . ”
79514	79522	79523	79523	I	441	“ You leave Dad out of this , ”
79527	79551	79523	79523	I	441	“ He ’s never broken a promise to me my entire life . And I bet he never broke one to you either ! ”
79552	79572	79573	79573	she	1083	“ He promised to love me . Instead he drove me away . He took my children from me , ”
79576	79582	79583	79583	I	441	“ Leaving was your choice , ”
79587	79600	79601	79601	She	1083	“ You betrayed Dad . You betrayed Millie and Winnie and me . ”
79605	79622	79601	79601	She	1083	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about . You do n’t know anything . ”
79623	79628	79629	79629	I	441	“ I know enough , ”
79753	79756	79757	79757	he	148	“ Hi , ”
79824	79829	79830	79830	I	441	“ Be right back . ”
79942	79945	79932	79932	I	441	“ Felicity ? ”
79965	79968	79969	79969	I	441	“ Felicity . ”
79983	79986	79969	79969	I	441	“ What ? ”
79987	79993	79969	79969	I	441	“ What are you doing ? ”
79994	79997	79998	79998	I	441	“ Nothing . ”
80011	80020	80003	80003	He	1087	“ Were you going to cut your hair ? ”
80077	80086	80069	80069	he	1087	“ Want to tell me what ’s up ? ”
80087	80090	80091	80091	I	441	“ No . ”
80102	80106	80091	80091	I	441	“ Why not ? ”
80107	80150	80069	80069	he	1087	“ Because you ’re busy and need to concentrate on work , not my bullshit . The entire point of this arrangement was for you to have time and space to work , and I do n’t want to be a burden . ”
80151	80199	80200	80200	He	1087	“ You are not a burden . Do I need to remind you how we promised to be there for each other when one of us needed a friend ? I know you did n’t use the code , but I ’m sensing the bat signal here . ”
80205	80217	80218	80218	I	441	“ Those scissors are a cry for help . Now talk . ”
80223	80228	80218	80218	I	441	“ My mother called . ”
80229	80232	80218	80218	I	441	“ Oh . ”
80270	80276	80277	80277	I	441	“ After all this time , ”
80288	80297	80277	80277	I	441	“ Why should she still have that power ? ”
80298	80312	80313	80313	he	1087	“ Because she ’s your mother and what she did left a scar , ”
80316	80331	80332	80332	I	441	“ But I do n’t need her . I do n’t even like her . ”
80341	80350	80332	80332	I	441	“ Why should it matter what she says ? ”
80351	80402	80277	80277	I	441	“ Maybe it does n’t matter whether you need her or like her . Maybe just the fact that deep down , you know she was your mother and was supposed to love and protect you , and instead she hurt you , is enough to fuck with your head . ”
80403	80406	80407	80407	I	441	“ Yeah . ”
80413	80417	80407	80407	I	441	“ I guess . ”
80418	80427	80428	80428	he	1089	“ Maybe you should talk to my sister , ”
80431	80458	80428	80428	he	1089	“ Or she could give you the name of someone else . While I am an expert at head fuckery , I ’m not a therapist . ”
80467	80474	80475	80475	He	1089	“ Look at you promoting therapy . ”
80478	80524	80475	80475	He	1089	“ Just because it did n’t solve my issues does n’t mean it ca n’t help you with yours . My shit is my own fault . Your shit was done to you — I bet a good therapist could help you work through it . ”
80525	80570	80571	80571	He	1089	“ Maybe . But how do you ever work through the fact that your own mother did n’t want you ? Or love you enough ? It ’s like this stupid voice in the back of my head that I ca n’t turn off . ”
80577	80598	80571	80571	He	1089	“ I wish I had a good answer . I ca n’t turn off the voices in my head either . ”
80624	80639	80571	80571	He	1089	“ Thanks for chasing me in here . I guess I did need you . ”
80640	80648	80649	80649	He	1089	“ I like when you need me . ”
80664	80671	80571	80571	He	1089	“ I wish things were different . ”
80672	80676	80571	80571	He	1089	“ Different how ? ”
80677	80683	80684	80684	He	1089	“ All kinds of ways . ”
80687	80697	80698	80698	I	441	“ I wish I had my magic powers back . ”
80701	80708	80698	80698	I	441	“ You ’re enough without them . ”
80709	80716	80717	80717	I	441	“ What would you wish for ? ”
80870	80892	80893	80893	I	441	“ I ’d wish for some ice cream , a bubble bath , and an orgasm — probably in that order , ”
80903	80910	80897	80897	He	1089	“ Now that I can deliver . ”
81616	81619	81605	81605	Her	1097	“ Hey . ”
81620	81656	81609	81609	her	1097	“ Hey . I ’m heading to my sister ’s to hang out with the kids for a while . You want to come with me ? I can wait for you to get dressed . ”
81657	81662	81663	81663	She	1097	“ I ca n’t . ”
81674	81693	81663	81663	She	1097	“ I ’m behind on a bunch of things , and I have to work at Etoile tonight . ”
81694	81697	81698	81698	I	441	“ Okay . ”
81715	81721	81663	81663	She	1097	“ So I was thinking . ”
81722	81726	81663	81663	She	1097	“ About what ? ”
81727	81739	81740	81740	She	1097	“ I have to be out of here by August fifteenth . ”
81747	81761	81740	81740	She	1097	“ I know . It ’s okay . I ’ll move back home . ”
81762	81772	81663	81663	She	1097	“ Why do n’t I rent you another place ? ”
81773	81779	81780	81780	She	1097	“ Rent me another place ? ”
81800	81828	81740	81740	She	1097	“ Well . . . yeah . That way you do n’t have to move back in with your parents when I go back to San Francisco . ”
81829	81847	81663	81663	She	1097	“ So you would n’t live in the new place ? It would just be for me ? ”
81848	81865	81866	81866	I	441	“ Right . But I ’d have a place to stay when I came to visit . ”
81872	81901	81903	81903	she	1097	“ You can stock the kitchen with everything you like . You can take all the things I bought for here and keep them in the new place . ”
81908	81930	81903	81903	she	1097	“ That wo n’t make sense , Hutton . We ’re supposed to break things off after the party , remember ? ”
81931	81940	81941	81941	I	441	“ I ’ve been thinking about that too . ”
81946	81976	81941	81941	I	441	“ Maybe we do n’t have to break things off entirely . Maybe we just say we ’ve decided not to get married , but we ’re still together . ”
81977	81994	81995	81995	I	441	“ We ’re still together , but you live in San Francisco and I live here ? ”
82005	82022	82023	82023	She	1097	“ I know it ’s not ideal , but it ’s better than nothing , right ? ”
82033	82040	82023	82023	She	1097	“ Better than nothing . Right . ”
82041	82050	82051	82051	I	441	“ Maybe we should talk about this later , ”
82054	82071	82051	82051	I	441	“ You ’re not fully awake yet , and I kind of ambushed you with this . ”
82072	82081	82023	82023	She	1097	“ I ’m awake enough to say no . ”
82082	82085	82086	82086	She	1097	“ Huh ? ”
82091	82116	82086	82086	She	1097	“ No . I do n’t want you to rent me another place . I do n’t want to be together but never together . ”
82117	82128	82023	82023	She	1097	“ So you ’d rather just break it off completely ? ”
82129	82134	82086	82086	She	1097	“ No , but — ”
82135	82142	82143	82143	I	441	“ Because those are the options , ”
82171	82181	82166	82166	she	1097	“ Those are the options ? Something or nothing ? ”
82182	82185	82186	82186	She	1097	“ Yes . ”
82190	82198	82186	82186	She	1097	“ Then I guess it ’s nothing . ”
82199	82211	82212	82212	I	441	“ Felicity , come on . We ’ve talked about this . ”
82221	82235	82212	82212	I	441	“ I ’ve never been dishonest with you about what I can offer . ”
82236	82240	82241	82241	Her	1097	“ I know . ”
82245	82273	82241	82241	Her	1097	“ And I ’ll be honest with you now , and say that what you have to offer is n’t enough for me . I ’m sorry . ”
82274	82278	82279	82279	I	441	“ We agreed , ”
82283	82305	82279	82279	I	441	“ We agreed that it ’s foolish to jump into the deep end of the pool when you ca n’t swim . ”
82306	82314	82315	82315	Her	1097	“ I did n’t jump , Hutton . ”
82319	82323	82324	82324	Her	1097	“ I fell . ”
82344	82355	82333	82333	I	441	“ You ’re asking for something I ca n’t give . ”
82356	82364	82365	82365	She	1097	“ I ’m not asking for anything . ”
82373	82403	82365	82365	She	1097	“ You know , I ’ve spent years being terrified of this very situation . Years of being careful with my heart so I would n’t ever be rejected . ”
82404	82409	82410	82410	I	441	“ Felicity . Stop . ”
82426	82434	82435	82435	she	1097	“ I thought I was so smart , ”
82438	82467	82435	82435	she	1097	“ But here I am anyway . And even though I wo n’t ask for what I want , I wo n’t settle for less than I deserve . ”
83426	83433	83419	83419	She	2105	“ Oh no . More bangs . ”
83456	83488	83442	83442	she	2105	“ Shhhh , it ’s okay . They ’re a little extreme , but at least they ’re even . . . ish . Did you cut any off the back ? ”
83489	83492	83493	83493	I	441	“ No , ”
83496	83503	83493	83493	I	441	“ I stopped myself for once . ”
83504	83508	83509	83509	She	2105	“ Good girl . ”
83532	83541	83527	83528	white chef	1130	“ Got time for some tea or lemonade ? ”
83542	83548	83549	83549	I	441	“ Yes . Thank you . ”
83588	83591	83582	83582	Muffin	143	“ Here . ”
83604	83634	83592	83592	Millie	2105	“ I ’d open some wine or something , but it looks like you have to work , and something tells me we ’d kill that bottle pretty fast . ”
83635	83644	83645	83645	She	2105	“ Yeah . I better stick to lemonade . ”
83663	83670	83645	83645	She	2105	“ So what ’s going on ? ”
83671	83679	83680	83680	I	441	“ It ’s this thing with Hutton , ”
83687	83696	83697	83697	She	2105	“ I think it might have turned real . ”
83715	83722	83723	83723	I	441	“ It did n’t start real , ”
83727	83773	83723	83723	I	441	“ It was all an act . A way for me to save face in front of Mimi Pepper - Peabody and for Hutton to get his mother off his back . Plus , I got to move out of Dad and Frannie ’s house . ”
83774	83793	83794	83794	Millie	2105	“ You know , both Winnie and I said you could move in with us , just saying , ”
83798	83805	83806	83806	I	441	“ That is n’t the point , ”
83810	83820	83821	83821	I	441	“ Of course not . Sorry . Go on . ”
83826	83849	83821	83821	I	441	“ Everything was fine until we got to New York . That ’s where I started to get . . . confused . ”
83850	83856	83857	83857	she	2105	“ Ca n’t imagine why , ”
83867	83876	83857	83857	she	2105	“ I was overwhelmed by the . . . ”
83887	83943	83877	83877	I	441	“ Whirlwind of fantasy . It ’s not easy to keep your feet on the ground when your head is in the clouds , you know ? I was never the girl who dreamed about being the princess , but Hutton just has this way of making me feel so beautiful and special and deserving . ”
83944	83950	83951	83951	Millie	2105	“ You are , Felicity . ”
83957	83963	83951	83951	Millie	2105	“ Do n’t doubt that . ”
83973	84032	83951	83951	Millie	2105	“ I do n’t know what to do , Millie . Hutton is the only guy I ’ve ever felt this close to . The one guy on the planet who gets me , who ’s seen me at my best and worst , who knows the crazy inner workings of my mind and does n’t judge me . ”
84053	84075	83951	83951	Millie	2105	“ Are you listening to yourself ? The one guy , the only guy ? You ’re in love with Hutton . ”
84076	84079	84080	84080	I	441	“ Shhhhhhhh ! ”
84094	84100	84080	84080	I	441	“ Do n’t say it ! ”
84101	84181	84182	84182	She	2105	“ Why not ? I feel like that ’s the one thing that ’s been said in this kitchen in the last couple weeks that makes any sense at all . This whole fake fiancé routine is insane . You guys love each other . You ’re good together . The whole reason people swallowed your whole cockamamie story to begin with is because it ’s so obvious to those around you that you two are meant to be . ”
84187	84217	84182	84182	She	2105	“ I know you ’ve got some weird allergy to love , which I have never fully understood , but it ’s time to get over it , Felicity . ”
84227	84245	84246	84246	She	2105	“ You want to know why I have an allergy to love ? I ’ll tell you . ”
84254	84259	84260	84260	Muffin	143	“ Yes . Please . ”
84294	84324	84325	84325	Millie	2105	“ When I was six , I overheard the fight Dad and Mom had the night she told him she was leaving . She said she never wanted us . ”
84331	84336	84325	84325	Millie	2105	“ Oh my God . ”
84337	84348	84325	84325	Millie	2105	“ But that ’s not all I heard her say . ”
84375	84384	84385	84386	My sister	234	“ And within days , she was gone . ”
84396	84415	84385	84386	My sister	234	“ Why did n’t you say something about what you ’d heard ? To me or to Dad ? ”
84416	84427	84428	84428	I	441	“ I did n’t want anyone else to be hurt , ”
84431	84465	84466	84466	Millie	2105	“ What she said meant she did n’t want you or Winnie either . And I knew I was n’t supposed to be listening . I was worried I might get in trouble . ”
84495	84504	84484	84484	she	2105	“ Sorry , I ’m out of tissues . ”
84505	84515	84516	84516	I	441	“ I ’m not going to cry over this , ”
84520	84524	84525	84525	She	2105	“ I am . ”
84543	84549	84525	84525	She	2105	“ Millie , do n’t . ”
84560	84579	84525	84525	She	2105	“ She does n’t deserve your tears . I ’m sorry , I should n’t have told you . ”
84580	84594	84595	84595	she	2105	“ I ’m not crying about her . I ’m crying about you , ”
84602	84616	84595	84595	she	2105	“ Carrying that around all these years and never saying anything about it . ”
84625	84637	84595	84595	she	2105	“ It was a long time ago . I ’m fine . ”
84638	84645	84646	84646	she	2105	“ No , you ’re not ! ”
84660	84690	84595	84595	she	2105	“ You ’re totally messed up over it . Now I understand why you left your relationships when someone told you they loved you . You never believed them . ”
84691	84697	84698	84698	I	441	“ Even if I did , ”
84705	84738	84698	84698	I	441	“ it would n’t matter in the end . People can love you one day and not the next . You wo n’t even know what you did until they ’re gone . ”
84739	84744	84745	84745	Millie	2105	“ Oh , Felicity . ”
84756	84799	84745	84745	Millie	2105	“ Mom did n’t leave because of something you did . She left because she met someone else . She ran off with some other guy . She did it to get back at Dad for not paying enough attention to her . ”
84800	84813	84814	84814	I	441	“ But if she really loved us , she ’d have stayed , ”
84817	84823	84824	84824	Millie	2105	“ Maybe , maybe not . ”
84839	84879	84831	84831	her	2105	“ Some people are just bad at love , you know ? They ’re too selfish or narcissistic , or deep down they do n’t love themselves , so they do n’t know how to accept it from others . ”
84889	84902	84903	84903	Millie	2105	“ Do you think some people just are n’t wired for love ? ”
84911	84942	84903	84903	Millie	2105	“ Me , personally ? No . I think some people choose to behave in ways that keep them closed off from it , but I think everyone is capable . ”
84953	84976	84943	84943	I	441	“ Hutton says he ’s not wired for love , because of his anxiety . He thinks he ’s better off alone . ”
84977	84993	84994	84994	My	441	“ People say a lot of things they do n’t mean when they ’re scared . ”
85004	85021	84994	84994	My	441	“ That ’s what I mean ! You ca n’t trust people to tell the truth ! ”
85022	85035	84943	84943	I	441	“ Does Hutton know how you feel ? Did you tell him ? ”
85036	85044	84994	84994	My	441	“ No , but I implied it . ”
85045	85048	85049	85049	She	441	“ Felicity . ”
85057	85102	85103	85103	I	441	“ Tell him the truth about your feelings . I ’m not saying you have to get engaged or married or even keep living together . But why not at least be honest ? What if hearing the words is the push he needs ? ”
85108	85120	85103	85103	I	441	“ He does n’t want to hear those words from me . ”
85121	85128	84943	84943	I	441	“ But you just told me — ”
85129	85158	85103	85103	I	441	“ I ’m not done . He has to be out of the house two weeks after the party . Our plan was to end things by then . ”
85159	85165	85166	85166	she	441	“ I remember the plan , ”
85170	85216	85166	85166	she	441	“ But then this morning he comes into the bedroom with a new plan . He said maybe he ’ll rent another place here and I can live in it . This way he ’ll have a place to stay when he comes to town . ”
85225	85228	85217	85217	Millie	2105	“ What ? ”
85229	85239	85240	85240	I	441	“ He wants to keep me like a pet , ”
85247	85253	85254	85254	Millie	2105	“ This makes no sense . ”
85259	85270	85254	85254	Millie	2105	“ Why would he say that ? He loves you . ”
85271	85275	85276	85276	I	441	“ Not enough , ”
85301	85311	85296	85296	I	441	“ Jesus Christ , this woman is so annoying ! ”
85312	85316	85336	85336	I	441	“ Carla again ? ”
85317	85335	85336	85336	I	441	“ No , fucking Mimi Pepper - Peabody . She keeps wanting to meet up with me . ”
85341	85381	85336	85336	I	441	“ Now she ’s making threats . This one says ‘ If I do n’t hear from you within twenty - four hours , you wo n’t have a chance to tell me your side of the story . ’ ”
85382	85390	85296	85296	I	441	“ What the hell does that mean ? ”
85391	85402	85336	85336	I	441	“ I have no idea . I ’m fucking exhausted . ”
85416	85425	85408	85408	I	441	“ But I have to go to work . ”
85426	85443	85444	85444	She	441	“ Me too . I ’m sorry — I feel like I was n’t much help . ”
85451	85458	85444	85444	She	441	“ Want to hang out tomorrow ? ”
85459	85467	85468	85468	I	441	“ Maybe . I ’ll text you . ”
85483	85495	85496	85496	she	441	“ I wish you would have told me about that night , ”
85503	85513	85496	85496	she	441	“ I feel awful you went through that alone . ”
85514	85519	85475	85475	she	441	“ It ’s okay . ”
85520	85528	85475	85475	she	441	“ Are you going to tell Dad ? ”
85529	85532	85475	85475	she	441	“ No . ”
85541	85575	85475	85475	she	441	“ Dad does not need to hear it at this point . He was hard enough on himself , and I do n’t want him feeling guilty about this . He ’s happy . ”
85576	85586	85587	85587	She	441	“ He is happy . Thank goodness for Frannie . ”
85592	85618	85619	85619	I	441	“ It ’s funny to me — Frannie was younger than we are now when she married Dad . Did n’t she seem so old ? ”
85624	85641	85619	85619	I	441	“ Yes . I ’d never seen two old people act so stupid . Especially Dad . ”
85642	85659	85660	85660	I	441	“ Think they would have gotten together if we had n’t told him what was what ? ”
85663	85685	85686	85686	She	441	“ Probably . It would have taken longer , since Dad was so stubborn , but they were obviously in love . ”
85691	85701	85686	85686	She	441	“ So you ’re saying love finds a way ? ”
85702	85709	85710	85710	I	441	“ It ’s different for us . ”
85713	85721	85710	85710	I	441	“ We ’re not Dad and Frannie . ”
85722	85728	85686	85686	She	441	“ What ’s so different ? ”
85729	85734	85735	85735	I	441	“ We ’re just — ”
85751	85759	85742	85742	I	441	“ We were born under different stars . ”
85799	85811	85788	85788	Gianni	150	“ Oh , hey . Someone ’s waiting to see you . ”
85812	85817	85788	85788	Gianni	150	“ What ? Where ? ”
85818	85841	85842	85842	I	441	“ I think she ’s in the tasting room now , but she walked right into the kitchen a little bit ago . ”
85847	85851	85842	85842	I	441	“ Tall blonde ? ”
85852	85865	85866	85866	He	148	“ Yeah . I told her she could n’t wait back here . ”
85869	85876	85866	85866	He	148	“ Sent her Ellie ’s way . ”
85877	85888	85889	85889	I	441	“ Sorry about that . I ’ll deal with her . ”
85894	85902	85889	85889	I	441	“ Should only take a few minutes . ”
85903	85907	85910	85910	I	441	“ Go ahead . ”
85972	85975	85976	85976	I	441	“ Hey , ”
85984	85991	85992	85992	She	412	“ You ’re looking for me ? ”
86004	86009	86010	86010	I	441	“ There you are . ”
86016	86021	86022	86022	She	412	“ Here I am . ”
86027	86043	86022	86022	She	412	“ Did you get your bangs cut again ? You really should fire that stylist . ”
86044	86059	86022	86022	She	412	“ What do you want , Mimi ? I have to get to work . ”
86060	86064	86065	86065	she	412	“ You know , ”
86072	86091	86065	86065	she	412	“ I was wondering why you ’d still work as a cook since getting engaged to a billionaire . ”
86092	86098	86099	86099	I	441	“ I like my job , ”
86106	86144	86145	86146	EIGHTEEN HUTTON	203	“ That ’s good , because now that I know the whole thing was a scam and you ’re not really engaged to a billionaire at all , you ’ll probably be working it for a while . ”
86147	86154	86145	86146	EIGHTEEN HUTTON	203	“ So how ’s it going ? ”
86169	86194	86159	86159	she	234	“ I have n’t even seen you since you got back from New York . You ignore me now that you have a fiancée . ”
86195	86198	86199	86199	I	441	“ Sorry . ”
86217	86230	86199	86199	I	441	“ Looks like you guys had fun . I saw some pictures . ”
86239	86260	86199	86199	I	441	“ We had fun . Despite the people who felt it necessary to intrude on our privacy and take photos . ”
86261	86269	86270	86270	She	234	“ The ones I saw were good . ”
86280	86300	86270	86270	She	234	“ I mean , you knew people were going to be interested . The love lives of celebrities sell . ”
86301	86328	86329	86329	Allie	73	“ But it ’s fucking annoying . I do n’t want to be a celebrity . And Felicity did n’t ask for that kind of attention . ”
86332	86350	86351	86351	She	234	“ No , but it sort of comes with the territory . She knows who you are . ”
86370	86378	86363	86363	I	441	“ Quite a ring you gave her . ”
86379	86382	86363	86363	I	441	“ Yeah . ”
86383	86393	86363	86363	I	441	“ Have you guys settled on a date yet ? ”
86394	86397	86398	86398	She	234	“ No . ”
86418	86423	86408	86408	she	234	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
86424	86427	86428	86428	I	441	“ Nothing . ”
86436	86442	86428	86428	I	441	“ Is it the hearing ? ”
86443	86451	86408	86408	she	234	“ That ’s a lot of it . ”
86452	86461	86462	86462	I	441	“ So what ’s the rest of it ? ”
86487	86498	86471	86472	The kids	277	“ You know I ’ll get it out of you . ”
86499	86509	86428	86428	I	441	“ Maybe I ’m dreading that stupid engagement party . ”
86510	86522	86471	86472	The kids	277	“ Hutton ! You ’re not supposed to know about that . ”
86523	86527	86471	86472	The kids	277	“ Too late . ”
86528	86533	86428	86428	I	441	“ Who told you ? ”
86534	86567	86568	86568	Allie	73	“ Felicity . She heard it from her sister that works at Abelard , because unlike my family , her family knows how much I hate parties and gave us a warning . ”
86592	86636	86588	86588	she	73	“ It was not my idea , okay ? But Mom consulted some crazy celestial calendar that said to throw a party on that date . When she found out it was available , she took it as a sign from the stars . ”
86637	86643	86588	86588	she	73	“ Of course she did . ”
86644	86653	86654	86654	I	441	“ Is that really what ’s bothering you ? ”
86672	86689	86588	86588	she	73	“ There ’s just a constant loop of negative shit running through my brain , okay ? ”
86690	86705	86588	86588	she	73	“ They ’re just thoughts . You do n’t have to give them power . ”
86706	86723	86588	86588	she	73	“ Do n’t go therapist on me . I do n’t fucking need it right now . ”
86724	86729	86730	86730	Her	73	“ Okay , okay . ”
86738	86745	86746	86746	I	441	“ I just want to help . ”
86751	86757	86746	86746	I	441	“ You ca n’t help . ”
86758	86814	86815	86815	She	73	“ All right . Then I ’ll just say I ’m really proud of you for having the guts to finally admit your feelings for Felicity and asking her to marry you . I know how hard that must have been . And I think you made the perfect choice . She ’s really amazing . ”
86821	86829	86830	86830	Allie	73	“ She ’s so good for you , ”
86834	86872	86830	86830	Allie	73	“ She ’s always understood you so well . You really need someone who ’s a safe place , someone to ground you . But also someone who can stand up to you when it ’s necessary . ”
86873	86877	86878	86878	I	441	“ I know , ”
86900	86964	86968	86968	her	441	“ I ’m just so glad you got out of your head and told her how you feel before it was too late . I mean , it took you long enough — but also , it came out of nowhere . One minute you wo n’t even go to a reunion , and the next — poof , you ’re getting married . ”
86970	86973	86968	86968	her	441	“ Allie . ”
86974	86977	86968	86968	her	441	“ Yes ? ”
86983	86987	86968	86968	her	441	“ You know . ”
86988	86992	86993	86993	She	441	“ Know what ? ”
86999	87046	86993	86993	She	441	“ That your sudden engagement is totally ridiculous ? That it was a ploy to get Mom off your back ? That you two are actually in love but somehow feel more comfortable faking it ? Which thing that I know should we talk about first ? ”
87047	87057	86968	86968	her	441	“ Fuck . Why did n’t you say something ? ”
87058	87117	87118	87118	She	441	“ What good would that have done ? You two clearly had your reasons , you ’re consenting adults , and people work out their shit in different ways . I just figured this was your way of finally crossing the line without fear . If you could call it all for show , it was less pressure . ”
87121	87139	87140	87140	I	441	“ Plus , it was a riot to watch you two react that morning at your house . ”
87143	87164	87140	87140	I	441	“ I ca n’t believe you knew . You made us take all those pictures ! You made us kiss . ”
87165	87169	87170	87170	She	441	“ I know . ”
87173	87183	87170	87170	She	441	“ So did you guys plant the story yourselves ? ”
87184	87188	87194	87194	I	441	“ Not exactly . ”
87238	87252	87253	87253	she	441	“ To get Mom off your back ? Was I right about that ? ”
87269	87276	87277	87277	I	441	“ Yes . Also . . . ”
87285	87305	87306	87306	I	441	“ Also , you wanted to be with her . And this handed you the opportunity without the vulnerability . ”
87309	87329	87306	87306	I	441	“ You do n’t have to make me sound like an asshole . We both agreed to the plan . ”
87330	87341	87342	87342	She	441	“ I ’m not here to judge you , Hutton . ”
87346	87359	87342	87342	She	441	“ But I have a feeling something went wrong with your plan . ”
87360	87368	87369	87369	I	441	“ Nothing was wrong with the plan , ”
87372	87395	87396	87396	She	441	“ The plan was perfect . What went wrong was that I tried to make it better , and she got mad . ”
87404	87408	87396	87396	She	441	“ Go on . ”
87409	87443	87396	87396	She	441	“ We were going to get through the party , then break it off and tell everyone we ’d decided we were better off as friends when I went back to San Francisco . ”
87444	87460	87461	87461	I	441	“ But then you realized you ’re in love with her and that plan sucks ? ”
87471	87489	87461	87461	I	441	“ Look , it does n’t really matter how I feel . We ca n’t stay together . ”
87490	87494	87396	87396	She	441	“ Why not ? ”
87495	87516	87517	87517	She	441	“ We just ca n’t , okay ? I ’m going back to San Francisco and her life is here . ”
87522	87529	87517	87517	She	441	“ So it ’s the distance ? ”
87530	87533	87534	87534	I	441	“ Yes , ”
87537	87551	87534	87534	I	441	“ But you ’re a billionaire . Ca n’t you work from anywhere ? ”
87565	87582	87534	87534	I	441	“ No , I ca n’t . I have to live where my company is based . ”
87583	87589	87517	87517	She	441	“ Felicity wo n’t move ? ”
87590	87597	87598	87598	I	441	“ I did n’t ask her . ”
87604	87608	87598	87598	I	441	“ Why not ? ”
87609	87659	87667	87667	she	441	“ Because her family is here , and her business is here , and she wo n’t want to upend her life that way for me . Why should she ? My relationships always end badly , and so do hers . We wanted something different . Something safer . ”
87660	87666	87667	87667	she	441	“ Interesting choice of words , ”
87670	87705	87667	87667	she	441	“ So you thought you were protecting yourself by giving the relationship a deadline ? That way neither of you would have to do the hurting or get hurt ? You could stay friends ? ”
87706	87709	87710	87710	I	441	“ Exactly ! ”
87720	87723	87710	87710	I	441	“ Foolproof . ”
87724	87740	87667	87667	she	441	“ So how did you attempt to improve upon this totally safe and foolproof plan ? ”
87741	87757	87758	87758	I	441	“ We have to be out of the house we ’re in by August fifteenth , ”
87761	87795	87796	87797	My sister	234	“ But I suggested that I could rent or buy another place and she could live there when I go back to San Francisco . I was trying to do her a favor . ”
87802	87811	87796	87797	My sister	234	“ By suggesting she become a kept woman ? ”
87812	87825	87796	87797	My sister	234	“ It would n’t be like that . I care about her . ”
87826	87840	87796	87797	My sister	234	“ But that ’s not what you said to her , is it ? ”
87841	87847	87848	87848	I	441	“ She knows I care , ”
87851	87860	87861	87861	I	441	“ She does n’t know you love her . ”
87866	87874	87861	87861	I	441	“ I ca n’t tell her that . ”
87875	87880	87894	87894	I	441	“ Because . . . ”
87881	87893	87894	87894	I	441	“ Because then I ’m just like her mother , okay ? ”
87897	87917	87918	87919	My sister	234	“ I ’d have to say it and walk away , and I ca n’t do that to her . ”
87925	87958	87959	87959	She	234	“ You ’re missing the point — I’m suggesting that maybe you do n’t walk away , Hutton . You tell her you love her and you find a way to stay . ”
87970	88019	87959	87959	She	234	“ You accept that you ’re not perfect , you accept that you ’ll probably always have that shitty voice in your head , but you accept that you ’re still deserving and fucking capable of love . Or you let her go . That ’s your choice . ”
88046	88053	88034	88034	my	441	“ I said no therapist shit . ”
88054	88067	88068	88068	She	234	“ That was n’t therapy shit . That was big sister shit . ”
88074	88087	88068	88068	She	234	“ Now you go out there and think about what you did . ”
88168	88178	88180	88180	Zosia	412	“ Why are you in such a bad mood ? ”
88196	88201	88186	88186	Her	412	“ I ’m not . ”
88219	88232	88209	88209	Keely	88	“ Yes , you are . You ’ve been grumpy all day . ”
88233	88247	88186	88186	Her	412	“ I just bought you an ice cream cone , did n’t I ? ”
88248	88251	88252	88252	she	234	“ Yes , ”
88263	88268	88256	88256	she	234	“ Want a lick ? ”
88269	88274	88209	88209	Keely	88	“ No , thanks . ”
88275	88287	88256	88256	she	234	“ When you get married , will Felicity be my aunt ? ”
88299	88304	88256	88256	she	234	“ I guess so . ”
88305	88318	88319	88319	I	441	“ And when you have kids , will they be my cousins ? ”
88323	88327	88319	88319	I	441	“ They would . ”
88328	88336	88342	88342	she	234	“ Cool . I want some cousins . ”
88345	88353	88342	88342	she	234	“ You ’ll be a good dad . ”
88360	88367	88342	88342	she	234	“ What makes you say that ? ”
88368	88392	88342	88342	she	234	“ You like the park , you never care about getting sandy or messy or wet , and you buy us ice cream . ”
88393	88405	88406	88406	She	234	“ That ’s all it takes to be a good dad ? ”
88409	88415	88406	88406	She	234	“ Pretty much , yeah . ”
88433	88449	88424	88424	she	234	“ Good luck in D.C. Call me if you need a pep talk , okay ? ”
88450	88453	88424	88424	she	234	“ Okay . ”
88454	88461	88424	88424	she	234	“ What time is your flight ? ”
88462	88467	88468	88468	She	234	“ Early . Six . ”
88480	88488	88468	88468	She	234	“ What will you do about Felicity ? ”
88489	88495	88496	88496	I	441	“ I do n’t know . ”
88499	88527	88528	88528	She	234	“ First I have to get through that fucking hearing . And maybe after a few days apart , I ’ll be able to think more clearly . ”
88531	88538	88528	88528	She	234	“ Sometimes distance does add perspective . ”
88539	88548	88549	88549	I	441	“ I wish I could see the future , ”
88552	88561	88549	88549	I	441	“ To know how it would play out . ”
88562	88566	88567	88567	Allie	73	“ Me too . ”
88571	88617	88567	88567	Allie	73	“ But unfortunately , no matter what Mom thinks , there ’s no way to know what the future holds . No dream , no crystal ball , no palm reading , or tea leaves or tarot card is going to give you the answer . ”
88618	88621	88622	88622	She	234	“ Yeah . ”
88634	88670	88622	88622	She	234	“ Even though we want the path to be clear and easy , the truth is , sometimes there ’s a lot of shit in the way . And the only way out is through . ”
88685	88689	88622	88622	She	234	“ Excuse me ? ”
88690	88700	88701	88701	She	234	“ Your engagement . It ’s all a lie . ”
88707	88711	88712	88712	I	441	“ Keep up . ”
88718	88725	88712	88712	I	441	“ What are you talking about ? ”
88726	88775	88712	88712	I	441	“ I will admit you two put on a pretty good show at the reunion , but it never sat right with me — maybe you ’d have made a cute couple back in high school , but a guy like Hutton is out of your league now . ”
88776	88788	88789	88789	I	441	“ Well , I ’m wearing a ring that says otherwise . ”
88805	88822	88823	88823	She	234	“ Yes , I know all about the ring and the dress and the . . . ”
88845	88848	88849	88849	I	441	“ Kink . ”
88855	88858	88849	88849	I	441	“ What ? ”
88859	88924	88849	88849	I	441	“ I was there , at the coffee shop last Saturday morning . I came in after you were already there and sat in the booth right behind you , but you were so preoccupied with your story that you did n’t even notice me . I do find it odd that you ’d have sex with someone you ’re not even really dating . ”
88925	88937	88938	88938	She	234	“ You were at Plum & Honey ? Sitting behind me ? ”
88945	88956	88957	88957	I	441	“ I heard you say all kinds of interesting things . ”
88984	88989	88957	88957	I	441	“ You ’re crazy . ”
88990	89021	89022	89022	She	234	“ I have notes , in case your memory is faulty . I did n’t want to forget a single word , so I wrote down what I was hearing . ”
89033	89064	89065	89065	She	234	“ ‘ Things are n’t like that with us . This is n’t a real relationship or a real engagement . It ’s something I made up , remember ? ’ ”
89071	89078	89065	89065	She	234	“ Does that ring a bell ? ”
89087	89131	89065	89065	She	234	“ Oh , there ’s also this . ‘ I know it might look real on the outside , but that ’s just because we ’re having a good time . It ’s one hundred percent fake . We are not together . ’ ”
89144	89180	89181	89181	She	234	“ I also heard the part about the safe word and the bloody nose — so good ! I mean , really , this story has everything , humor , sex , deception . . . ”
89186	89192	89193	89193	My	441	“ I was thoroughly entertained . ”
89198	89219	89220	89220	She	234	“ Mimi , I have to go to work . I do n’t know what your problem is , but — ”
89223	89236	89220	89220	She	234	“ I do n’t have a problem , Felicity . You do . ”
89237	89243	89181	89181	She	234	“ And what ’s that ? ”
89244	89279	89220	89220	She	234	“ I ’m going to make sure this story gets out , and then what will your perfect family think ? It ’s obvious to me only one sister knows you ’re scamming everyone . ”
89280	89287	89288	89288	I	441	“ We ’re not scamming anyone , ”
89291	89299	89288	89288	I	441	“ This is none of your business . ”
89300	89340	89220	89220	She	234	“ Oh really ? Because I was chatting with your mom at her coffee shop before I left on Saturday , and it was obvious she does n’t know you ’re a liar . She was just so happy . ”
89341	89349	89350	89350	I	441	“ Leave my family out of this , ”
89356	89397	89350	89350	I	441	“ And Hutton ’s family too . I happened to run into his mother at her shop last week , and she was simply beside herself about your upcoming nuptials . She could n’t say enough sweet things about you . ”
89424	89430	89431	89431	she	441	“ I was also thinking , ”
89442	89483	89431	89431	she	441	“ how terrible it would be for Hutton if this got out . I know he ’s testifying this week down in D.C. The last thing he ’d want people saying about him is that he ’s crooked and shady . ”
89593	89602	89603	89603	I	441	“ Why are you doing this , Mimi ? ”
89608	89615	89616	89616	She	441	“ I do n’t get it . ”
89628	89652	89616	89616	She	441	“ I ’m doing this because I do n’t think it ’s right that people can just lie and get away with it . ”
89653	89665	89624	89624	her	441	“ So you ’re doing this in the name of truth ? ”
89666	89669	89616	89616	She	441	“ Exactly . ”
89670	89673	89674	89674	I	441	“ Bullshit ! ”
89696	89706	89707	89707	Mimi	412	“ You ’re doing this because you ’re jealous . ”
89720	89725	89715	89715	She	412	“ Jealous ? Moi ? ”
89726	89729	89730	89730	Fired	209	“ Yes . ”
89740	89747	89748	89748	She	412	“ You . Are . Jealous . ”
89759	89769	89748	89748	She	412	“ What would I have to be jealous about ? ”
89770	89792	89793	89793	I	441	“ I do n’t know . My ring ? Hutton ’s money ? The attention we ’re getting ? Or maybe , ”
89812	89838	89793	89793	I	441	“ maybe it ’s my relationship with Hutton . The way we look at each other . Respect each other . How close we are . ”
89839	89848	89849	89849	she	412	“ That wo n’t last , you know , ”
89853	89913	89914	89914	I	441	“ Thornton used to look at me that way , the way Hutton looks at you . It goes away . The business trips get longer . The rumors about other girls will start . His clothes will smell like cheap perfume . His lies will get more clumsy , until he wo n’t even bother to lie anymore . ”
89919	89924	89914	89914	I	441	“ We ’re different . ”
89925	89928	89929	89929	She	412	“ Anyway . ”
89945	89981	89982	89982	She	412	“ People deserve to know the truth . But I ’m not totally heartless . I ’m giving you a chance to offer your side of the story . Explain why you faked an engagement . ”
89987	90045	89982	89982	She	412	“ Was it about money ? Was he paying you to make him seem more normal ? There are all those rumors about him being weird and anti - social . Then there are the things Zlatka said about him wanting to be cruel to her in the bedroom . Tie her up and boss her around . ”
90065	90071	90060	90060	I	441	“ I have no comment . ”
90072	90081	89982	89982	She	412	“ You do n’t want to defend yourself ? ”
90082	90090	90060	90060	I	441	“ I have n’t done anything wrong . ”
90091	90097	90060	90060	I	441	“ You lied to me ! ”
90098	90103	90104	90104	I	441	“ Okay , fine ! ”
90110	90194	90104	90104	I	441	“ You want an explanation ? Here it is . I was sick and tired of you making me feel small . You did it all through high school and I vowed that I was not going to let you do it again . So when you stood there at the reunion cutting me down to size , instead of telling you to fuck off like I should have , I made up the lie about being engaged to Hutton to save face . ”
90195	90202	90203	90203	She	1170	“ You did it for me ? ”
90208	90219	90220	90220	I	441	“ I did it to take you down a notch , ”
90223	90226	90227	90227	She	1170	“ Oh . ”
90232	90254	90255	90255	I	441	“ I did it for girls like me who never had the guts to stand up for themselves in high school , ”
90259	90322	90255	90255	I	441	“ I did it because it ’s not okay to treat people like you ’re better than they are just because you have really great hair . And then I snuck off to a coat closet and called Hutton , begging him to come rescue me , even though he hated high school , hates parties , and dreads being in public . ”
90323	90329	90330	90330	She	1170	“ And he showed up ? ”
90334	90352	90330	90330	She	1170	“ Yes . He showed up . That ’s what friends like us do for each other . ”
90353	90402	90403	90403	Mimi	412	“ God . Thornton would never have done that for me . I had to drag him to that reunion , and he complained the whole time , even though I ’d done so much work to put on a nice event . He does n’t appreciate me . ”
90406	90416	90417	90417	I	441	“ It ’s almost not even worth the money . ”
90422	90428	90417	90417	I	441	“ So find someone else . ”
90429	90436	90437	90437	She	1170	“ Easy for you to say . ”
90440	90471	90437	90437	She	1170	“ Everyone likes you . Everyone thinks you ’re so clever and talented and sweet . Even in high school , no one ever said a bad word about you . ”
90472	90489	90490	90490	She	1170	“ Mimi , give me a break . You were the most popular girl in school . ”
90495	90511	90490	90490	She	1170	“ They were scared of me . It ’s not the same as being liked . ”
90512	90529	90437	90437	She	1170	“ They were scared because you were mean . Why do n’t you try being kind ? ”
90530	90538	90539	90539	She	1170	“ Then I would n’t be respected . ”
90542	90560	90561	90561	I	441	“ But I ’ll give it some thought . I ’ve been working on self - love . ”
90567	90593	90561	90561	I	441	“ Look , I do n’t have time to argue about this . What can I do to persuade you not to leak this story ? ”
90594	90643	90561	90561	I	441	“ Nothing . I promised Thornton ’s sister a big story . She runs dirty - little - scoop - dot - com and she hates me , so I need this to butter her up . She ’s always in Thornton ’s ear saying shit about me . ”
90644	90653	90561	90561	I	441	“ Ca n’t you give her another scoop ? ”
90654	90660	90661	90661	she	441	“ Do you have one ? ”
90670	90673	90665	90665	I	441	“ No . ”
90674	90684	90685	90685	She	441	“ Then I have to use you . Sorry . ”
90693	90698	90699	90699	I	441	“ Wait a minute . ”
90707	90721	90722	90722	Mimi	412	“ Can you at least wait until after the weekend to tell her ? ”
90728	90739	90740	90740	I	441	“ I guess . What ’s in it for me ? ”
90746	90758	90740	90740	I	441	“ I ’ll give you my side . Complete insider scoop . ”
90765	90773	90740	90740	I	441	“ Including the part about the kink ? ”
90774	90784	90740	90740	I	441	“ No . But I ’ll spill everything else . ”
90829	90835	90813	90813	I	441	“ When can it run ? ”
90836	90839	90813	90813	I	441	“ Monday . ”
90910	90913	90915	90915	Mimi	412	“ Fine , ”
90917	90932	90915	90915	Mimi	412	“ But you have to give me your side of the story this week . ”
90933	90949	90950	90950	Mimi	412	“ You ’ll get it no sooner than Sunday . I do n’t trust you . ”
90954	90973	90974	90974	I	441	“ I ’m not a monster , Felicity . I ’m just a woman looking out for herself . ”
90981	91003	91004	91004	I	441	“ You know , Mimi , there ’s something other than self - love I think you need to work on , ”
91008	91014	91004	91004	I	441	“ It ’s called empathy . ”
91657	91666	91667	91667	I	441	“ I ’m going back to the hotel , ”
91681	91688	91667	91667	I	441	“ I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
91689	91704	91705	91705	I	441	“ Dude , do n’t leave now . Orbach is n’t even here yet . ”
91724	91729	91730	91730	I	441	“ I ’m out , ”
91733	91736	91737	91737	Wade	77	“ Sorry . ”
91742	91770	91737	91737	Wade	77	“ Fine . I ’ll stay and gather the intel . We ’ll have breakfast tomorrow before the hearing . Answer your fucking phone in the morning . ”
92335	92338	92330	92330	I	441	“ Hello ? ”
92346	92353	92343	92343	She	1195	“ Uh . . . hi . ”
92354	92357	92330	92330	I	441	“ Hi . ”
92358	92374	92343	92343	She	1195	“ I did n’t think you ’d answer . I thought you were at work . ”
92375	92389	92343	92343	She	1195	“ I was n’t feeling well tonight . I took the night off . ”
92390	92395	92396	92396	I	441	“ Are you okay ? ”
92402	92416	92396	92396	I	441	“ I ’m fine . Just . . . needed a night off . ”
92417	92420	92421	92421	I	441	“ Oh . ”
92435	92440	92421	92421	I	441	“ Is someone there ? ”
92441	92454	92396	92396	I	441	“ Millie . She ’s , um , helping me with something . ”
92455	92458	92396	92396	I	441	“ Oh . ”
92459	92466	92421	92421	I	441	“ She says good luck tomorrow . ”
92467	92472	92473	92473	I	441	“ Tell her thanks . ”
92509	92517	92504	92504	she	1198	“ How ’s your trip so far ? ”
92518	92523	92504	92504	she	1198	“ It ’s fine . ”
92524	92532	92504	92504	she	1198	“ How are you feeling about tomorrow ? ”
92533	92536	92504	92504	she	1198	“ Nervous . ”
92537	92549	92504	92504	she	1198	“ You ’re gon na be amazing . I know it . ”
92550	92553	92554	92554	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
92566	92586	92554	92554	I	441	“ Felicity , I . . . I want to say something , but I do n’t know how . ”
92587	92591	92592	92592	Her	1198	“ Hang on . ”
92620	92628	92617	92617	she	1198	“ What do you want to say ? ”
92664	92669	92660	92660	I	441	“ I ’m sorry . ”
92672	92676	92660	92660	I	441	“ For what ? ”
92677	92696	92705	92705	she	1198	“ For what I said yesterday morning . I should n’t have made the offer about the house . ”
92697	92704	92705	92705	she	1198	“ Oh . It ’s okay , ”
92708	92719	92705	92705	she	1198	“ You did it to be nice . I understand . ”
92757	92771	92749	92749	I	441	“ You know I would do anything for you , if you asked . ”
92772	92776	92777	92777	Her	1198	“ I know . ”
92781	92791	92777	92777	Her	1198	“ But some things you ca n’t ask for . ”
92792	92795	92749	92749	I	441	“ Felicity — ”
92796	92812	92749	92749	I	441	“ It was a good idea we had . To end things how we planned . ”
92819	92822	92749	92749	I	441	“ What ? ”
92823	92872	92873	92873	I	441	“ It ’s the right way . The only way . We ’ll get through the party , and then figure things out . But it ’s nothing you need to worry about now . Focus on the hearing , and we ’ll talk when you get back . ”
92881	92888	92873	92873	I	441	“ Is that what you want ? ”
92889	92899	92900	92900	Her	1198	“ It ’s what we agreed to , Hutton . ”
92907	92918	92900	92900	Her	1198	“ It ’s how this was always going to end . ”
93075	93097	93069	93069	She	2105	“ Hey . Thought maybe you could use this . Hope Hutton does n’t mind I opened a bottle of wine . ”
93098	93118	93069	93069	She	2105	“ He wo n’t . I probably bought it anyway . But what I really need is a tissue . ”
93119	93124	93125	93125	She	2105	“ Be right back . ”
93148	93153	93139	93139	Kleenex	212	“ Here you go . ”
93154	93157	93158	93158	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
93176	93184	93185	93185	Millie	2105	“ God , it ’s beautiful here . ”
93194	93203	93185	93185	Millie	2105	“ I would n’t want to leave either . ”
93204	93217	93218	93218	She	2105	“ It ’s not the view I ’m going to miss most . ”
93223	93236	93218	93218	She	2105	“ I know . I loaded the last bag in the car . ”
93237	93272	93185	93185	Millie	2105	“ Thanks . I promise I wo n’t stay with you too long — just until after the party , when it will make more sense that I had to move out of here . ”
93273	93286	93287	93287	She	2105	“ You can stay with me as long as you need to . ”
93292	93299	93287	93287	She	2105	“ So what did he say ? ”
93300	93317	93218	93218	She	2105	“ He said he was sorry for offering me a place to live when he leaves . ”
93318	93323	93287	93287	She	2105	“ That ’s it ? ”
93324	93339	93340	93340	Millie	2105	“ He also said he would do anything for me , if I asked . ”
93343	93354	93340	93340	Millie	2105	“ But you ca n’t ask him to love you . ”
93355	93358	93359	93359	I	441	“ Nope , ”
93367	93372	93359	93359	I	441	“ I ca n’t . ”
93507	93538	93539	93539	I	441	“ Hutton French was the most articulate , and gave measured , thoughtful answers to all questions , admitting when something was uncertain and offering solutions that addressed major concerns . ”
93572	93577	93578	93578	she	58	“ Oh , hey , ”
93587	93616	93578	93578	she	58	“ I need to borrow Millie ’s hand mixer , and she said I should just come get it . Mine broke . What are you doing here ? ”
93617	93622	93623	93623	My	441	“ Um . . . ”
93635	93645	93646	93646	Winnie	58	“ Actually , I ’m staying here right now . ”
93651	93664	93646	93646	Winnie	58	“ What ? Why ? Did you and Hutton have a fight ? ”
93665	93669	93670	93670	Tears	213	“ Not exactly . ”
93683	93694	93670	93670	Tears	213	“ We ’re just taking a little time - out . ”
93695	93714	93715	93715	Her	58	“ A time - out ? But you just got engaged ! Your party is in two days ! ”
93719	93728	93715	93715	Her	58	“ Is that why you cut those bangs ? ”
93738	93741	93742	93742	Winnie	58	“ Yeah . ”
93749	93754	93742	93742	Winnie	58	“ Need to talk ? ”
93755	93778	93779	93779	I	441	“ There ’s really not much to talk about . We ’re just — thinking things over . Taking a step back . ”
93790	93798	93799	93799	Winnie	58	“ We did move kind of fast . ”
93803	93862	93863	93863	I	441	“ I guess , but . . . but you ’ve been so close for so many years ! You had these feelings buried deep inside you ! He was pining for you from afar , and you were locked in a tower of longing , knowing you were meant to be , and suddenly there he was ! ”
93868	93876	93877	93877	She	58	“ Wow . A tower of longing ? ”
93885	93896	93877	93877	She	58	“ I ’m a romantic , okay ? Sue me . ”
93897	93907	93908	93908	I	441	“ Look , it ’s just not that simple . ”
93920	93935	93908	93908	I	441	“ Hutton and I both have some baggage that makes it difficult to trust . ”
93936	94000	93877	93877	She	58	“ Everyone has baggage ! Dex ’s baggage could sink a ship ! His parents ’ marriage was awful , his dad was absent and emotionally abusive , his divorce was difficult , he ’s a single dad . . . believe me , it was not easy to work through . But if you love each other , you do the work . ”
94001	94006	94007	94007	I	441	“ I get it . ”
94016	94025	94007	94007	I	441	“ And maybe we ’ll figure it out . ”
94026	94040	94041	94041	Winnie	58	“ You have to . You love each other . . . right ? ”
94045	94052	94053	94053	I	441	“ There is love between us , ”
94064	94073	94057	94057	She	58	“ What should I do about the party ? ”
94074	94077	94078	94078	I	441	“ Nothing . ”
94085	94104	94078	94078	I	441	“ Just let it go on as planned . We do n’t want to cause anyone any stress . ”
94105	94120	94057	94057	She	58	“ But if you guys are n’t even together , what ’s the point ? ”
94121	94128	94129	94129	I	441	“ We ’re not not together , ”
94142	94151	94129	94129	I	441	“ So why are you living with Millie ? ”
94152	94169	94170	94170	I	441	“ For some space . But Winnie , you ca n’t tell anyone I ’m here . ”
94174	94214	94170	94170	I	441	“ I mean it — not Mom , not Dad , not Hutton ’s family , not anyone . I know it ’s hard for you to keep secrets , but I need you to keep this to yourself . ”
94215	94219	94220	94220	she	441	“ I promise , ”
94224	94236	94237	94237	She	441	“ I ’m locking my lips and throwing away the key . ”
94252	94256	94237	94237	She	441	“ Thank you . ”
94257	94266	94267	94267	Her	441	“ But I ’m really sad about this . ”
94271	94288	94289	94289	My	441	“ I love you guys together . I want you to have a happily ever after . ”
94303	94327	94294	94294	I	441	“ We ’ll always be friends , no matter what . That might be what our happily ever after looks like , okay ? ”
94335	94352	94353	94353	I	441	“ No . That is not how a romance ends . I do n’t accept it . ”
94368	94375	94353	94353	I	441	“ Try . I will too . ”
94681	94693	94694	94694	Wade	77	“ Dude , come on . Let ’s go get drunk . ”
94707	94736	94694	94694	Wade	77	“ This smokin ’ hot intern told me where she and her friends hang out after work . She said they ’ll be there by five - thirty . ”
94737	94743	94744	94744	Wade	77	“ I ’m not interested . ”
94747	94773	94744	94744	Wade	77	“ You ’re never interested . But you killed it in there , do n’t you want to celebrate ? One drink . Come on . ”
94786	94822	94744	94744	Wade	77	“ Fine , one drink . But I ’m not going to some bar crowded with interns . Let ’s just grab a drink somewhere close , then I ’ll go back to the hotel . ”
94823	94835	94836	94836	He	77	“ You ’re such a fucking old lady . But fine . ”
94844	94849	94836	94836	He	77	“ Let ’s go . ”
94853	94863	94864	94864	Wade	77	“ So what ’s the deal with this engagement ? ”
94873	94882	94864	94864	Wade	77	“ You really gon na marry this chick ? ”
94890	94899	94900	94900	He	77	“ I do n’t want to discuss it . ”
94903	94909	94910	94910	I	441	“ Trouble in paradise already ? ”
94918	94985	94986	94986	Wade	77	“ Listen , I get it . Women are a fucking pain in the ass . They ’re never satisfied . You give them one thing , and then they want more . They say they do n’t want you to change , but they do . They claim they ’re happy if you ’re happy , but that ’s the biggest fucking lie of all . ”
95000	95028	94986	94986	Wade	77	“ They do n’t want you to be happy . They want you to be miserable , and they go at it like it ’s their job . ”
95029	95036	94986	94986	Wade	77	“ Felicity is n’t like that . ”
95037	95062	94986	94986	Wade	77	“ Well , she ’s not like that now . But it changes once that ring is on your finger . Mark my words . ”
95063	95086	95087	95087	Wade	77	“ I ’ve known her for fifteen years . She ’d never want anyone to be miserable , least of all me . ”
95090	95135	95136	95136	I	441	“ If you say so . But think about it — marriage is fucking permanent . You ca n’t just get out of it . One woman until the end . One body . One piece of ass for the rest of your life . ”
95141	95147	95148	95148	He	77	“ You ’re a dick . ”
95157	95234	95148	95148	He	77	“ I ’m just trying to be a good friend , dude . Warn you about what ’s ahead — but if you like eating the same meal every night until the end of time , be my guest and get married . Because that ’s what it ’s like . Even if the steak is good , you get bored . And I ca n’t help it if I sometimes want to taste something else . ”
95235	95252	95253	95253	Wade	77	“ If you do n’t stop talking , I might actually punch you in the face . ”
95260	95266	95253	95253	Wade	77	“ What ’s your problem ? ”
95267	95352	95353	95353	Wade	77	“ My problem is that I love this woman you ’re talking about like she ’s a fucking piece of meat . And I ca n’t think of anything better than having her to myself for the rest of my life . The thought of being with someone else is absurd . The thought of her being with someone else makes me want to put my fist through the wall . The thought of losing her because I ’m a fucking idiot is unacceptable . ”
95356	95390	95353	95353	Wade	77	“ Okay . Then get married . But do n’t blame me when it all goes to hell and you wish you were banging hot interns instead of getting your ass chewed out . ”
95391	95397	95398	95398	I	441	“ I have to go . ”
95411	95420	95398	95398	I	441	“ When are you back in the office ? ”
95421	95427	95428	95428	I	441	“ I do n’t know . ”
95435	95439	95428	95428	I	441	“ Maybe never . ”
95440	95450	95398	95398	I	441	“ Huh ? What the fuck does that mean ? ”
95451	95517	95398	95398	I	441	“ It means I did what I came here to do , but it does n’t matter as much as I thought it would — or rather , the reason it matters has nothing to do with HFX , and everything to do with me realizing I might fail but taking the risk anyway , because not taking it would have been the greater failure . ”
95518	95525	95428	95428	I	441	“ Dude . You lost me . ”
95526	95530	95531	95531	I	441	“ Never mind . ”
95636	95639	95615	95615	I	441	“ Hey . ”
95655	95660	95640	95640	I	441	“ I ’m home . ”
95694	95697	95688	95688	I	441	“ Felicity ? ”
95751	95754	95740	95740	I	441	“ Fuck ! ”
96134	96140	96125	96125	She	234	“ You ’re back already ? ”
96141	96149	96125	96125	She	234	“ Yeah . Can I come in ? ”
96150	96154	96155	96155	She	234	“ Of course ! ”
96162	96170	96155	96155	She	234	“ Congratulations . You did so great ! ”
96171	96174	96125	96125	She	234	“ Thanks . ”
96175	96189	96125	96125	She	234	“ How ’d you get through it ? Was it my stellar advice ? ”
96190	96196	96197	96197	I	441	“ Your suggestions did help , ”
96200	96206	96197	96197	I	441	“ Thanks for the text . ”
96207	96212	96213	96213	She	234	“ You ’re welcome . ”
96224	96261	96213	96213	She	234	“ The things I said were based on the principles of acceptance and commitment therapy , by the way . I asked Natalia for a few ideas . She ’s still open to talking with you . ”
96262	96271	96272	96272	I	441	“ I might take her up on that . ”
96282	96291	96292	96292	Her	234	“ But first , I need your advice . ”
96304	96311	96296	96296	She	234	“ Did I hear that right ? ”
96312	96322	96323	96323	She	234	“ Please do n’t joke . This is serious . ”
96328	96338	96323	96323	She	234	“ Okay . Want something to eat ? Coffee ? ”
96339	96350	96296	96296	She	234	“ Coffee sounds good . I did n’t sleep much . ”
96351	96366	96367	96367	I	441	“ I can tell . You ’ve got some major circles under those eyes . ”
96373	96379	96367	96367	I	441	“ Where are the kids ? ”
96380	96411	96412	96412	She	234	“ They slept at Mom and Dad ’s . I have early appointments this morning , so I have to be at the office in about forty - five minutes . ”
96424	96427	96412	96412	She	234	“ Speak . ”
96428	96444	96445	96445	She	234	“ Felicity moved out while I was gone . She did it without telling me . ”
96448	96456	96445	96445	She	234	“ How do you feel about that ? ”
96457	96485	96412	96412	She	234	“ At first I was angry that she just up and left without saying anything — we’ve been friends a long time , and it felt shitty . ”
96486	96491	96445	96445	She	234	“ That ’s understandable . ”
96492	96514	96445	96445	She	234	“ But she left me this letter that explained why she moved out , and it fucking tore me apart inside . ”
96515	96521	96412	96412	She	234	“ What did she say ? ”
96522	96547	96445	96445	She	234	“ She said she did n’t want to tell me because she did n’t want me to have additional stress while I was in D.C. ”
96548	96555	96445	96445	She	234	“ That was thoughtful of her . ”
96556	96595	96596	96596	Allie	73	“ She said she left because she needed to step back from the fantasy of being a couple and remember what was real . She said she got carried away and her feelings grew beyond make - believe . ”
96599	96608	96596	96596	Allie	73	“ She ’s scared . She ran away . ”
96609	96624	96445	96445	She	234	“ She said it ’s not my fault and she does n’t blame me . ”
96625	96631	96596	96596	Allie	73	“ Do you blame yourself ? ”
96632	96642	96643	96643	I	441	“ Yes . No . I do n’t know . ”
96657	96666	96643	96643	I	441	“ She ’s everything to me , Allie . ”
96667	96674	96596	96596	Allie	73	“ She needs to hear that . ”
96675	96694	96643	96643	I	441	“ She told me not to contact her . She asked me to respect her need for space . ”
96695	96701	96643	96643	I	441	“ What about the party ? ”
96702	96730	96731	96731	I	441	“ She said she ’ll call me tomorrow and we ’ll make a plan to attend it , and then afterward figure out how to end things . ”
96735	96757	96758	96758	Allie	73	“ But I ca n’t let that happen . I ca n’t go a day without trying to get her back . ”
96762	96765	96758	96758	Allie	73	“ Okay . ”
96766	96775	96776	96776	I	441	“ That ’s why I need your advice . ”
96781	96807	96776	96776	I	441	“ What can I say to convince her to give me another chance ? How can I prove to her that she can trust me ? ”
96808	96819	96820	96820	she	73	“ You could start with telling her how you feel , ”
96823	96835	96776	96776	I	441	“ If you love her , she needs to hear it . ”
96836	96849	96850	96850	I	441	“ I do love her . I do . But . . . ”
96856	96878	96850	96850	I	441	“ I ca n’t get over this fucking thing in my head telling me I ’m not good enough for her . ”
96883	96889	96890	96890	I	441	“ Maybe you ’re not . ”
96895	96898	96890	96890	I	441	“ Huh ? ”
96899	96941	96942	96942	I	441	“ I mean , maybe the thing in your head is right . Maybe you ’re not good enough for her . Maybe you ’re going to fuck it up . Maybe she ’ll decide you ’re not worth the trouble . ”
96947	96953	96942	96942	I	441	“ You ’re not helping . ”
96954	96958	96959	96959	she	234	“ But maybe , ”
96963	97013	97014	97014	She	234	“ maybe you risk it . Maybe you get to spend the rest of your life doing things to make every day better for her . You ’ve already got her heart , Hutton . So maybe you find ways — big and small — to deserve it forever . ”
97019	97031	97014	97014	She	234	“ Does n’t that sound like a nice way to live ? ”
97083	97086	97087	97087	I	441	“ Thanks , ”
97096	97101	97102	97102	she	234	“ You ’re welcome ! ”
97107	97116	97102	97102	she	234	“ I ’ll bill you for the session ! ”
97177	97215	97172	97172	I	441	“ Hey , it ’s me . I found your letter . I want to respect your need for space , but I also really want to talk to you . Can you call me back please ? ”
97428	97434	97423	97423	I	441	“ Can I help you ? ”
97464	97467	97459	97459	I	441	“ Hutton ? ”
97486	97493	97494	97494	she	1252	“ What are you doing here ? ”
97497	97504	97505	97505	I	441	“ Can I talk to you ? ”
97510	97513	97514	97514	She	1252	“ Please ? ”
97518	97530	97514	97514	She	1252	“ Um , okay . Let ’s go to my office . ”
97541	97544	97545	97545	I	441	“ Thanks , ”
97555	97560	97545	97545	I	441	“ I appreciate this . ”
97561	97565	97566	97566	She	1252	“ Of course . ”
97575	97581	97566	97566	She	1252	“ Please have a seat . ”
97591	97597	97598	97598	I	441	“ I need your help , ”
97601	97604	97605	97605	Her	1252	“ Okay . ”
97617	97632	97605	97605	Her	1252	“ I ’m looking for Felicity . Do you know where she might be ? ”
97633	97642	97643	97643	she	1252	“ Do I know where she might be ? ”
97646	97649	97605	97605	Her	1252	“ Yes . ”
97650	97653	97654	97654	She	1252	“ Um . ”
97661	97667	97654	97654	She	1252	“ I ca n’t say . ”
97668	97684	97694	97694	she	1252	“ Winnie , please . I need to talk to her . It ’s important . ”
97702	97707	97694	97694	she	1252	“ But I promised . ”
97708	97713	97714	97714	I	441	“ Okay . Okay . ”
97723	97744	97714	97714	I	441	“ I know she probably told you not to say anything to anyone . But did she specifically mention me ? ”
97745	97748	97749	97749	she	1252	“ No , ”
97758	97775	97749	97749	she	1252	“ But she said not to tell anyone . And I ca n’t let her down . ”
97776	97780	97781	97781	I	441	“ I understand . ”
97786	97795	97796	97796	She	1252	“ But this is sort of an emergency . ”
97801	97806	97796	97796	She	1252	“ Are you okay ? ”
97807	97831	97832	97832	Winnie	58	“ Yes and no . I will be if I can talk to Felicity . There ’s something I have to tell her . ”
97844	97857	97832	97832	Winnie	58	“ I can keep a secret . I can keep a secret . ”
97858	97867	97868	97868	I	441	“ I ’ll give you a billion dollars . ”
97899	97904	97905	97905	She	1252	“ Is that necessary ? ”
97919	97922	97923	97923	I	441	“ Okay . ”
97929	97951	97923	97923	I	441	“ I get it . You do n’t want to betray her , and I appreciate that . But . . . ”
97959	97977	97978	97978	She	1252	“ I ’ve never been in love before , and I ’m not handling it very well . ”
97996	98063	98064	98064	Winnie	58	“ I do n’t know what I ’m doing . I ’m scared every word out of my mouth will be wrong . I ’m scared she wo n’t believe me when I tell her how much she means to me . I ’m scared that I blew my chance to be with the only girl who has ever made me feel like I ’m okay . ”
98079	98100	98073	98073	she	1252	“ You did n’t . You can win her back . But maybe it should be something more than words . ”
98101	98108	98073	98073	she	1252	“ Like what ? Tell me , ”
98112	98120	98121	98121	She	1252	“ I ’ll do whatever it takes . ”
98127	98143	98144	98144	Winnie	58	“ You know , Felicity has always been a little different from Millie and me , ”
98147	98211	98144	98144	Winnie	58	“ Smarter and quieter and not into the same kinds of things we were . She was never overly obsessed with clothes or makeup or boys . When we played Cinderella as kids , I was the princess , Millie was the fairy godmother or the evil stepmother , depending on her mood , and you know what Felicity always wanted to be ? ”
98212	98215	98073	98073	she	1252	“ What ? ”
98216	98221	98144	98144	Winnie	58	“ Merlin the wizard . ”
98230	98296	98144	98144	Winnie	58	“ We ’d be like , ‘ There ’s no wizard in this story ! Ca n’t you be the prince ? ’ And she ’d be all , ‘ No ! The prince sucks ! What does he do to deserve her , ask her to dance ? Kiss her ? He never knows a thing about her , not even her name ! ’ ”
98297	98306	98307	98307	I	441	“ I mean , she ’s not wrong , ”
98310	98339	98340	98340	Winnie	58	“ So she put Merlin the wizard into Cinderella . And somehow , in the end , it was always Merlin ’s magic that really saved the day . ”
98343	98373	98374	98374	She	58	“ I guess what I ’m trying to say is , Felicity does n’t need a prince . She does n’t need to be rescued . But . . . ”
98377	98388	98374	98374	She	58	“ Every girl wants to feel like a princess sometimes . ”
98389	98393	98394	98394	I	441	“ I understand . ”
98397	98404	98405	98405	Winnie	58	“ No , I do n’t . ”
98409	98424	98405	98405	Winnie	58	“ You know her , Hutton . I think you can figure this out . ”
98430	98439	98440	98440	Winnie	58	“ Can you get a message to her ? ”
98443	98459	98460	98460	She	58	“ Do you have a piece of paper I could use ? And a pen ? ”
98519	98526	98527	98527	She	58	“ You ’re a good sister . ”
98530	98541	98527	98527	She	58	“ Thank you . My family is everything to me . ”
98630	98643	98644	98644	he	150	“ She ’s been in here a couple times looking for you , ”
98647	98660	98644	98644	he	150	“ She tried calling and texting but said you did n’t respond . ”
98661	98688	98689	98689	I	441	“ Yeah , I ’m taking a break from my social media , and it seemed easier to just take a break from my phone altogether , ”
98692	98701	98689	98689	I	441	“ I ’ll go see what she wants . ”
98723	98726	98727	98727	I	441	“ Hey , ”
98730	98737	98727	98727	I	441	“ You were looking for me ? ”
98738	98745	98746	98746	She	58	“ Yes . Hutton was here . ”
98749	98769	98746	98746	She	58	“ But I kept the secret . I had to tape my mouth shut , but I kept it . ”
98770	98773	98774	98774	My	441	“ Today ? ”
98778	98784	98774	98774	My	441	“ He was here today ? ”
98785	98792	98746	98746	She	58	“ Yes . Earlier this afternoon . ”
98793	98799	98800	98800	My	441	“ What did he want ? ”
98807	98821	98822	98822	she	58	“ To know where to find you . I did n’t tell him , ”
98826	98835	98836	98836	She	58	“ But I promised to give you this . ”
98881	98886	98887	98887	Winnie	58	“ What is it ? ”
98890	98897	98887	98887	Winnie	58	“ Some kind of secret language ? ”
98898	98901	98902	98902	I	441	“ Yes . ”
98905	98929	98902	98902	I	441	“ It says ‘ I love you . ’ It ’s written in the code we promised each other we ’d always honor . ”
98930	98953	98887	98887	Winnie	58	“ Aww , that ’s so cute . He looked really miserable — he does love you , Lissy . So much . ”
98954	98959	98902	98902	I	441	“ You think so ? ”
98960	99008	98902	98902	I	441	“ Of course I do ! He told me he ’s never been in love before , and he does n’t know what he ’s doing , and he ’s scared he blew his only chance to be with the one person who means everything to him . ”
99014	99020	99021	99021	He	217	“ He said all that ? ”
99029	99075	99076	99076	She	441	“ Yes ! And I ’m sure I was not supposed to tell you any of it , but in my defense , I did make it obvious I ’m terrible at keeping secrets . He also offered me a billion dollars for your whereabouts . ”
99081	99094	99095	99095	I	441	“ I want you to know I did n’t take the money . ”
99098	99102	99103	99103	She	441	“ Thank you . ”
99111	99146	99103	99103	She	441	“ You ’re welcome . I think maybe you should hear him out , Felicity . Guys are n’t perfect , you know ? Sometimes they need a second chance to get something right . ”
99166	99169	99162	99162	I	441	“ Hello ? ”
99176	99188	99162	99162	I	441	“ That ’s new . I was expecting your usual greeting . ”
99189	99199	99103	99103	She	441	“ I ’m working on some things about myself . ”
99200	99205	99206	99206	I	441	“ Good for you . ”
99209	99220	99206	99206	I	441	“ I got the bat signal . Are you okay ? ”
99221	99242	99162	99162	I	441	“ No . There ’s something I have to tell you , or it ’s going to eat me alive . ”
99243	99246	99103	99103	She	441	“ Okay . ”
99247	99253	99206	99206	I	441	“ Can I see you ? ”
99254	99265	99273	99273	he	1260	“ I guess so . I ’m at Millie ’s . ”
99266	99272	99273	99273	he	1260	“ Text me the address , ”
99276	99287	99288	99288	We	1261	“ I ’ll be there as fast as I can . ”
99407	99410	99400	99400	he	1260	“ Hey , ”
99419	99422	99411	99411	I	441	“ Hey . ”
99430	99440	99423	99423	His	1260	“ Will you go for a drive with me ? ”
99441	99444	99445	99445	He	1260	“ Sure . ”
99486	99494	99495	99495	I	441	“ Are we going anywhere in particular ? ”
99498	99503	99495	99495	I	441	“ You ’ll see . ”
99664	99669	99670	99670	she	1270	“ There you are , ”
99674	99680	99670	99670	she	1270	“ I was getting nervous . ”
99681	99692	99670	99670	she	1270	“ Sorry , Gladys . Thanks a lot for this . ”
99693	99706	99707	99707	She	1270	“ You ’re welcome , dear . I ’m glad to help . ”
99719	99729	99730	99730	Hutton	148	“ Do n’t turn any lights on , okay ? ”
99733	99740	99730	99730	Hutton	148	“ We wo n’t be long . ”
99741	99750	99751	99751	Gladys	162	“ I ’ll just wait in my car . ”
99778	99783	99784	99784	I	441	“ What on earth ? ”
99801	99807	99787	99787	Hutton	148	“ Why are we here ? ”
99808	99817	99818	99818	He	148	“ I need a second chance at something . ”
99862	99866	99854	99854	Hutton	148	“ Thank you . ”
99874	99913	99867	99867	He	148	“ I do n’t know what would have happened if I ’d had the nerve to kiss you that night . But I do know that I have always regretted not taking that chance when I had it . ”
99914	99922	99923	99923	I	441	“ Is this a do - over ? ”
99941	99949	99950	99950	He	148	“ It ’s a do - better . ”
99963	99973	99974	99974	I	441	“ You ’re not chewing gum , are you ? ”
99979	99982	99974	99974	I	441	“ Good . ”
100007	100018	99974	99974	I	441	“ Everything is going to be different from now on . ”
100019	100023	99974	99974	I	441	“ It is ? ”
100024	100049	99974	99974	I	441	“ Yes . That night , you told me something you ’d never told anyone before . I ’m going to return the favor . ”
100050	100053	99974	99974	I	441	“ Okay . ”
100063	100094	100095	100095	I	441	“ I love you , Felicity . I ’ve always loved you . And if you ’ll let me , I will love you for the rest of my life . ”
100098	100107	100095	100095	I	441	“ Oh my God . Hutton , I — ”
100108	100152	99974	99974	I	441	“ Hold on . I want to hear every single word you want to say , but I ’m afraid if I do n’t get everything out all at once , I ’ll lose my nerve . Or I ’ll forget something important . ”
100153	100156	100157	100157	I	441	“ Okay , ”
100163	100266	100157	100157	I	441	“ That day my family showed up at my house and I asked you to keep pretending we were engaged , it was n’t only because I wanted my mother off my back . It was because I wanted the chance to be with you without the risk of losing you . I did n’t trust myself not to screw things up . I did n’t believe that someone like me could hold onto someone like you . I was convinced that if you got close enough , you ’d see all my flaws and idiosyncrasies and know you could do better . ”
100267	100274	100275	100275	I	441	“ All I want is you , ”
100278	100303	100275	100275	I	441	“ But I understand your fear . I was scared too . I thought I could ration my feelings the way I usually did . ”
100304	100308	100309	100309	I	441	“ Like truffles ? ”
100312	100334	100309	100309	I	441	“ Like truffles . But it did n’t work . Every day we were together I just fell deeper and deeper . ”
100335	100340	100341	100341	he	1278	“ I did too , ”
100344	100357	100309	100309	I	441	“ I was a wreck when we got home from New York . ”
100358	100374	100375	100375	I	441	“ Same ! Even in New York — that day I tried on the dress . ”
100380	100396	100375	100375	I	441	“ I knew it was n’t just a dress , no matter what you said . ”
100397	100402	100309	100309	I	441	“ You were right . ”
100403	100408	100409	100409	I	441	“ And the ring . ”
100423	100431	100409	100409	I	441	“ You gave me a real ring . ”
100432	100461	100375	100375	I	441	“ I wanted to buy you all the real things , because my feelings were real . But it was easier to spend money than to admit them . ”
100462	100480	100375	100375	I	441	“ Let ’s make a promise that we ’ll be honest with each other from now on . ”
100481	100484	100409	100409	I	441	“ Deal . ”
100485	100498	100499	100499	He	1279	“ Is this where I can tell you I love you too ? ”
100502	100505	100499	100499	He	1279	“ Sure . ”
100506	100537	100538	100538	I	441	“ I love you too — everything about you . What you see as flaws and idiosyncrasies are what make you different and special . I ’m not perfect either , ”
100544	100575	100538	100538	I	441	“ I ’ll probably always cut my hair when I ’m stressed , never walk right in high heels , and continue to blurt random things when I ’m nervous . ”
100576	100590	100499	100499	He	1279	“ I might think you were the wrong girl if you did n’t . ”
100591	100626	100538	100538	I	441	“ And I know that you might not always be in touch with your earthy bull feelings , but I promise to be patient and not snatch them back into my little crab shell . ”
100627	100630	100631	100631	He	1280	“ Good . ”
100638	100648	100631	100631	He	1280	“ Because there ’s only one crab for me . ”
100649	100660	100661	100661	He	1280	“ So what happened that made you realize all this ? ”
100664	100706	100707	100707	I	441	“ My sister . Turns out , she knew the engagement was bullshit , but she did n’t say anything , because she thought it was just how we were working up the nerve to admit how we felt for real . ”
100710	100715	100707	100707	I	441	“ Just like Millie ! ”
100716	100740	100741	100741	He	1280	“ She saw me wrestling with my feelings and pretty much told me I had to get over myself or let you go . ”
100746	100760	100741	100741	He	1280	“ Letting you go was not an option . So here we are . ”
100761	100766	100767	100767	I	441	“ Here we are . ”
100773	100781	100767	100767	I	441	“ How are we here , anyway ? ”
100782	100797	100741	100741	He	1280	“ Turns out , one of the Prancin ’ Grannies is the boss here . ”
100798	100801	100767	100767	I	441	“ Gladys ? ”
100802	100805	100806	100806	He	1280	“ Gladys . ”
100809	100826	100827	100827	I	441	“ Also I made a very large donation to the Friends of the Public Library Foundation . ”
100830	100842	100827	100827	I	441	“ Will there be a Hutton French wing sometime next year ? ”
100843	100846	100847	100847	He	1280	“ Possibly . ”
100858	100874	100847	100847	He	1280	“ What are the chances I can get you to come home with me tonight ? ”
100875	100885	100886	100886	He	1280	“ Hmm . Are we talking theoretical probability here ? ”
100889	100894	100886	100886	He	1280	“ If you insist . ”
100895	100919	100847	100847	He	1280	“ Then I would say the desired outcome is highly likely . In fact , I would say it is a mathematical certainty . ”
100949	100954	100955	100955	I	441	“ Five more minutes , ”
101082	101087	101088	101088	he	148	“ So about tonight , ”
101101	101109	101088	101088	he	148	“ I have a surprise for you . ”
101110	101114	101115	101115	I	441	“ You do ? ”
101121	101135	101115	101115	I	441	“ Yes — that is , if I have permission to surprise you . ”
101136	101140	101141	101141	I	441	“ You do . ”
101144	101150	101141	101141	I	441	“ I like your surprises . ”
101151	101173	101088	101088	he	148	“ I just have one request . Can I pick you up for the party at your sister Millie ’s house ? ”
101174	101180	101141	101141	I	441	“ Sure . But why ? ”
101181	101193	101194	101194	He	1283	“ If I tell you , that will spoil the surprise . ”
101202	101210	101194	101194	He	1283	“ You just have to trust me . ”
101211	101215	101216	101216	I	441	“ I do . ”
101224	101230	101216	101216	I	441	“ I do trust you . ”
101231	101252	101253	101253	I	441	“ I have n’t mentioned this yet , but I told Wade I ’m not coming back to San Francisco . ”
101263	101271	101253	101253	I	441	“ What ? You ’re leaving HFX ? ”
101272	101301	101302	101302	My	441	“ I have n’t decided that yet . But I want to live here — with you . I ’ll start looking for a new place this week . ”
101306	101337	101302	101302	My	441	“ Really ? You ’ll stay here ? Because I ’d go with you to California if that ’s what you wanted . My business can go anywhere with me . ”
101338	101379	101380	101380	I	441	“ Nah . I ’ve had enough of that life . I like it here . My family is here , your family is here , it ’s peaceful and quiet . . . I do n’t want to leave . ”
101395	101403	101404	101404	he	1284	“ Everything is going to be okay , ”
101493	101504	101506	101506	Luna	95	“ This is like Cinderella ’s stepsisters after the ball , ”
101509	101523	101524	101524	Hallie	96	“ Except she ’s not mean or ugly and all the shoes fit , ”
101531	101544	101528	101528	I	441	“ Which one do you think will go best with the dress ? ”
101545	101550	101551	101551	Luna	95	“ The sparkly ones ! ”
101574	101583	101528	101528	I	441	“ Those look the most like glass slippers . ”
101584	101601	101528	101528	I	441	“ Of course you ’d pick those . Is n’t there a princess who wore sneakers ? ”
101602	101613	101614	101614	Millie	2105	“ No . What should we do with her hair ? ”
101618	101621	101614	101614	Millie	2105	“ Hmmm . ”
101637	101651	101652	101652	Millie	2105	“ What about a high bun ? Sort of an Audrey Hepburn look ? ”
101655	101660	101652	101652	Millie	2105	“ That could work . ”
101702	101705	101706	101706	I	441	“ Well ? ”
101714	101720	101706	101706	I	441	“ How do I look ? ”
101721	101724	101725	101725	Millie	2105	“ Perfect . ”
101731	101737	101738	101738	Luna	95	“ I love that dress , ”
101741	101751	101738	101738	Luna	95	“ Yes , even the hair is n’t bad . ”
101757	101762	101763	101763	I	441	“ I like it ! ”
101810	101816	101806	101806	I	441	“ Thanks , you guys . ”
101817	101826	101828	101828	Luna	95	“ I thought the party was a surprise , ”
101830	101838	101828	101828	Luna	95	“ How come you know about it ? ”
101839	101847	101848	101848	Hallie	96	“ Because Winnie ca n’t keep secrets , ”
101852	101855	101856	101856	I	441	“ Shhh . ”
101864	101892	101856	101856	I	441	“ We ’re going to pretend I did n’t know . You all look wonderful too . I ’m so glad you ’ll all be there tonight . ”
101905	101911	101856	101856	I	441	“ I ’ll get it ! ”
102070	102076	102077	102077	he	148	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
102092	102096	102077	102077	he	148	“ Thank you . ”
102108	102118	102103	102103	he	148	“ He rode here in a carriage , Felicity ! ”
102129	102135	102136	102136	Luna	95	“ With two white horses ! ”
102155	102160	102161	102161	He	148	“ Is this true ? ”
102164	102178	102161	102161	He	148	“ I heard that was how billionaires got around back in the day . ”
102199	102204	102181	102181	I	441	“ Oh my God ! ”
102234	102242	102244	102244	Hutton	148	“ Our driver ’s name is Alfred , ”
102250	102280	102244	102244	Hutton	148	“ And he did warn me that it will take a little longer to get to Abelard by horse than by car , so we should probably get moving . ”
102281	102290	102291	102291	Millie	2105	“ Wait , let me take a picture ! ”
102328	102330	102319	102320	The driver	580	“ Miss. ”
102331	102336	102337	102337	I	441	“ Hello , Alfred , ”
102340	102346	102337	102337	I	441	“ Nice to meet you . ”
102347	102354	102355	102355	Winnie	58	“ We ’ll see you there ! ”
102368	102379	102361	102361	Luna	95	“ And remember — you never knew about the party ! ”
102415	102456	102457	102457	He	148	“ I can not believe you did this . For someone who does n’t like to be the center of attention , this is insane . Are you really Hutton French , the friend I ’ve known for fifteen years ? ”
102460	102483	102457	102457	He	148	“ Yes and no . I ’m really Hutton French , but I do n’t want to be just your friend anymore . ”
102484	102496	102497	102497	His	148	“ Good . Because I ’m wildly in love with you . ”
102503	102534	102497	102497	His	148	“ You ’re stunning , Felicity . I know I have to share you with a lot of people tonight , but I ca n’t wait to take you home . ”
102539	102555	102497	102497	His	148	“ I missed you so much while you were gone . I hated sleeping alone . ”
102556	102574	102575	102575	He	148	“ You do n’t ever have to sleep alone again , if you do n’t want to . ”
102580	102596	102575	102575	He	148	“ I meant what I said last night . I want to love you forever . ”
102597	102605	102575	102575	He	148	“ That ’s what I want too . ”
102641	102668	102636	102636	I	441	“ So what now ? Should we just pretend like we ’ve decided to postpone the wedding ? We can always say that Millie could n’t — ”
102669	102672	102673	102673	He	148	“ Hey . ”
102679	102690	102691	102691	I	441	“ How about we just enjoy the ride for now ? ”
102694	102700	102691	102691	I	441	“ Sounds good to me . ”
102737	102742	102734	102734	Hutton	148	“ Oh , Jesus . ”
102743	102746	102747	102747	He	148	“ What ? ”
102756	102767	102747	102747	He	148	“ Looks like our public is here to greet us . ”
102802	102814	102815	102815	I	441	“ Hello ! Congratulations ! We ’re so happy for you ! ”
102828	102832	102819	102819	I	441	“ Thank you ! ”
102833	102845	102846	102846	he	148	“ One of them — Mona — is married to Alfred , ”
102849	102859	102846	102846	he	148	“ That ’s how I arranged this so quickly . ”
102860	102872	102873	102873	I	441	“ Wow , you and the Grannies are tight these days , ”
102876	102890	102873	102873	I	441	“ They were very eager to help me make this special for you . ”
102891	102901	102846	102846	he	148	“ Awww . That ’s so nice of them . ”
102917	102928	102912	102912	Hutton	148	“ We might have to invite them to our wedding . ”
102940	102944	102945	102945	He	148	“ Our what ? ”
103000	103007	103008	103008	he	148	“ This is the real thing , ”
103028	103056	103020	103020	His	148	“ I already got you the ring , and you ’re already wearing the dress , so I thought maybe I should ask you the real question . ”
103057	103062	103063	103063	I	441	“ Oh my God . ”
103072	103085	103063	103063	I	441	“ Oh my God , I ca n’t believe this is happening . ”
103086	103175	103020	103020	His	148	“ Felicity MacAllister , I ’ve loved you longer than you know , and there will never be another human on this earth that matters more to me . I may not have magic powers , but you understand me , you accept me , you make me happy . I know this is probably a shock to you , and if you do n’t want to say yes today , that ’s okay too , but you are the only one for me , today and always . ”
103176	103179	103180	103180	I	441	“ Yes , ”
103189	103199	103200	103200	He	1311	“ Of course yes ! A thousand times yes ! ”
103243	103260	103261	103261	He	1311	“ You do have magic powers — you turned this thing into a real engagement party ! ”
103279	103285	103269	103269	I	441	“ I ’ll never tell . ”
103286	103296	103297	103297	Hutton	148	“ What do you say , ladies ? Alfred ? ”
103303	103311	103297	103297	Hutton	148	“ Would you like to join us ? ”
103312	103320	103322	103329	a granny with thick penciled - in eyebrows	1314	“ We thought you ’d never ask , ”
103336	103352	103331	103331	Hutton	148	“ Felicity , this is Jackie . Her grandson is flying the plane up there . ”
103353	103364	103365	103365	I	441	“ It ’s so nice to meet you , Jackie . ”
103372	103381	103365	103365	I	441	“ And thank you all for being here . ”
103382	103388	103389	103389	Jackie	161	“ You ’re very welcome . ”
103395	103400	103401	103401	They	1313	“ Lead the way . ”
103423	103426	103413	103414	our families	125	“ Surprise ! ”
103438	103445	103413	103414	our families	125	“ Let Me Call You Sweetheart . ”
103446	103453	103454	103454	I	441	“ Guess this is our song , ”
103474	103480	103481	103481	he	148	“ Their repertoire is limited , ”
103485	103492	103481	103481	he	148	“ But it works for me . ”
103538	103541	103542	103543	Mrs. French	127	“ Awww , ”
103550	103561	103546	103546	she	127	“ I ’m so happy , I could cry too ! ”
103605	103613	103614	103614	Luna	95	“ We passed you on the road ! ”
103618	103630	103614	103614	Luna	95	“ But we were n’t allowed to yell out the windows . ”
103631	103637	103639	103639	Hallie	96	“ Or honk the horn , ”
103641	103649	103650	103650	I	441	“ Thank you so much for coming , ”
103655	103664	103650	103650	I	441	“ I ’m so glad you ’re here . ”
103665	103671	103673	103673	Hallie	96	“ We love engagement parties , ”
103675	103689	103673	103673	Hallie	96	“ Last time we went to one was the day we met Winnie ! ”
103690	103713	103715	103715	Luna	95	“ We ’re hoping our dad will ask Winnie to marry him , but he says to stop bugging him about it , ”
103722	103732	103717	103717	Hallie	96	“ We ’ll never stop bugging him about it . ”
103733	103736	103738	103738	Luna	95	“ Never , ”
103740	103751	103752	103752	Hallie	96	“ But there ’s one thing I do n’t understand , ”
103766	103787	103788	103788	Hutton	148	“ Why does that sign say ‘ Felicity , will you marry me ? ’ Were n’t you already engaged ? ”
103800	103805	103806	103806	I	441	“ Yes and no , ”
103813	103820	103806	103806	I	441	“ Both things can be true . ”
103889	103892	103893	103893	I	441	“ Hey , ”
103902	103912	103893	103893	I	441	“ How are you ? Sorry we got separated . ”
103913	103918	103919	103919	He	148	“ I ’m fine . ”
103924	103936	103919	103919	He	148	“ Just needed a minute or two to catch my breath . ”
103937	103949	103950	103950	I	441	“ You ’ve been amazing tonight . Thank you for this . ”
103958	103962	103950	103950	I	441	“ For everything . ”
103963	103968	103969	103969	I	441	“ You ’re welcome . ”
103990	104001	103950	103950	I	441	“ It ’s so beautiful here , is n’t it ? ”
104002	104010	103950	103950	I	441	“ Would you like to live here ? ”
104011	104015	104016	104016	I	441	“ At Abelard ? ”
104019	104024	104016	104016	I	441	“ Who would n’t ? ”
104025	104060	104061	104061	He	148	“ Maybe not this exact spot , but maybe we could find something nearby . Or something on the water . Or something with some acreage and you could have your own small farm . ”
104064	104082	104083	104083	I	441	“ I might like being a farmer . Seems like a job with a lot of solitude . ”
104087	104092	104083	104083	I	441	“ You ’re serious ? ”
104093	104096	104097	104097	He	148	“ Yes . ”
104100	104112	104097	104097	He	148	“ I told Wade I might not come back to HFX . ”
104117	104120	104097	104097	He	148	“ What ? ”
104121	104151	104152	104152	My	441	“ It will likely mean a significant drop in my tax bracket , but I was thinking of doing something else with my life — starting with marrying you . ”
104162	104191	104192	104192	He	148	“ I feel like someone is going to wake me up any minute . This is a dream . You ’d give up being a billionaire for me ? ”
104195	104221	104192	104192	He	148	“ I ’ll still be a billionaire . But on a smaller scale . Hopefully small enough that no one will care about me anymore . ”
104237	104251	104252	104252	He	148	“ I ’ll care . Not about your billions . Just about you . ”
104263	104272	104252	104252	He	148	“ Will you move back in with me ? ”
104273	104279	104234	104234	his	148	“ Of course I will . ”
104280	104289	104290	104290	I	441	“ And stay for seventy - two years ? ”
104297	104301	104290	104290	I	441	“ At least . ”
104302	104341	104234	104234	his	148	“ Speaking of home , how much longer do we have to stay at this party ? As much as I love you in that dress , I ’m going to love you out of it even more . ”
104342	104347	104348	104348	I	441	“ You know what ? ”
104372	104393	104394	104394	He	148	“ I think we ’ve given them enough of us tonight . Should we say our goodbyes and sneak out ? ”
104401	104412	104394	104394	He	148	“ You never have to ask me that question twice . ”
104512	104516	104507	104507	Hutton	148	“ Come here . ”
104696	104701	104702	104702	I	441	“ I want this , ”
104712	104717	104702	104702	I	441	“ I need it . ”
104718	104725	104726	104726	He	148	“ You ’ll have to wait . ”
104746	104751	104757	104757	he	148	“ I ’m hungry . ”
104986	105011	105012	105012	he	148	“ I ’d rip this dress to shreds just to get it off you , but not if you want to wear it again , ”
105022	105028	105012	105012	he	148	“ So tell me now . ”
105029	105033	105034	105034	I	441	“ No ripping ! ”
105038	105051	105052	105052	He	148	“ I want to get married in this dress . Side zipper . ”
105100	105104	105105	105105	I	441	“ But wait , ”
105114	105127	105105	105105	I	441	“ You ’ve seen the dress already . Is that bad luck ? ”
105128	105137	105138	105138	he	148	“ Nope . We make our own luck , ”
105154	105203	105138	105138	he	148	“ I mean , I could spend a couple minutes trying to convert our odds to implied probabilities , but I ’m afraid my cognitive abilities have been hijacked by my dick and I ’m likely to misjudge the variance of the payout . Now get over here . ”
105257	105265	105244	105244	I	441	“ You ’re such a math nerd . ”
105266	105272	105273	105273	he	148	“ Some things never change , ”
105372	105377	105378	105378	I	441	“ I love you , ”
105385	105391	105392	105392	he	148	“ I love you too , ”
105400	105419	105392	105392	he	148	“ And I do n’t care what the odds are . I ’d bet on us every time . ”
105517	105534	105535	105535	Hutton	148	“ If anyone comes to the door in the morning , we ’re not answering it , ”
105539	105546	105535	105535	Hutton	148	“ I ’m not sharing you . ”
105547	105550	105551	105551	I	441	“ Deal , ”
105554	105574	105551	105551	I	441	“ We can stay in bed all day , and then go get the rest of my — shoot ! ”
105575	105578	105579	105579	I	441	“ What ? ”
105608	105625	105594	105594	I	441	“ I have to tell you something , and you ’re not going to like it . ”
105626	105629	105630	105630	He	148	“ Now ? ”
105633	105666	105630	105630	He	148	“ Because I ’m really fucking content , and if it ’s like a big brunch or something you want me to attend in the morning , I ’d rather not know . ”
105667	105680	105681	105681	I	441	“ It ’s not brunch . It ’s Mimi Pepper - Peabody . ”
105708	105718	105700	105700	Hutton	148	“ Wait . She ’s trying to blackmail you ? ”
105719	105739	105689	105689	Plum	198	“ Not exactly . I do n’t think she wants money or anything . She just wants a story . ”
105740	105752	105753	105753	He	148	“ Well , fuck her . She ca n’t have ours . ”
105758	105774	105775	105775	I	441	“ I ’ll fucking buy that stupid tabloid tomorrow and put it out of business . ”
105778	105806	105775	105775	I	441	“ I know you would , but you know what ? I ’d rather have the satisfaction of telling Mimi she has no power over me anymore . ”
105807	105831	105700	105700	Hutton	148	“ Good . She ’s the one who ’s going to look like an asshole anyway , since we actually are getting married . ”
105832	105835	105775	105775	I	441	“ True . ”
105836	105847	105775	105775	I	441	“ When do you want to do that , anyway ? ”
105848	105852	105853	105853	I	441	“ Get married ? ”
105859	105885	105853	105853	I	441	“ You know , unless you want to wait , we could just keep the wedding date Millie set aside for us at Cloverleigh Farms . ”
105886	105900	105901	105901	I	441	“ I do n’t need to wait . I know what I want . ”
105910	105928	105901	105901	I	441	“ Then let ’s do it . We can let everyone know tomorrow to save the date . ”
105936	105962	105901	105901	I	441	“ Oh yeah . I forgot there would be other people involved . I do n’t suppose I can convince you to elope , huh ? ”
105963	105982	105991	105991	I	441	“ No , but I do n’t need a three - ring circus either . Just our families . ”
105983	105990	105991	105991	I	441	“ And the Prancin ’ Grannies . ”
105994	106001	105991	105991	I	441	“ And the Prancin ’ Grannies . ”
106079	106085	106075	106075	she	412	“ You ’re here together ? ”
106086	106092	106093	106093	I	441	“ Of course we are , ”
106096	106118	106119	106119	Mimi	412	“ And we only have a few minutes because we ’re heading to Cloverleigh Farms to finalize plans for our ceremony . ”
106124	106136	106119	106119	Mimi	412	“ Ceremony ? As in , you ’re really getting married ? ”
106137	106149	106075	106075	she	412	“ We ’re really getting married . Last Sunday in August . ”
106150	106162	106119	106119	Mimi	412	“ But you said it was fake ! I heard you ! ”
106163	106169	106170	106170	I	441	“ You must have misunderstood , ”
106184	106201	106181	106181	Mimi	412	“ I did not . You admitted it to me in the tasting room at Abelard . ”
106202	106232	106075	106075	she	412	“ I ’m sure I have no idea what you mean . You were drinking that day . Perhaps you ’re confused — wine can do that to you . ”
106233	106239	106240	106240	Mimi	412	“ I was n’t confused , ”
106243	106269	106240	106240	Mimi	412	“ You told me you ’d made the whole thing up to take me down a notch . Now you ’re saying it ’s real ? ”
106270	106273	106274	106274	I	441	“ Exactly . ”
106280	106284	106285	106285	She	412	“ Keep up . ”
106296	106304	106285	106285	She	412	“ I could still leak the story . ”
106305	106309	106310	106310	I	441	“ You could , ”
106313	106331	106332	106332	Mimi	412	“ but you ’re the one who will look like a fool when we tie the knot . ”
106335	106355	106332	106332	Mimi	412	“ This is n’t fair . I ’m not the one who lied , but I ’m being punished . ”
106356	106374	106375	106375	Hutton	148	“ You lied to Felicity at the reunion when you swore you would n’t reveal our engagement , ”
106379	106385	106386	106386	Mimi	412	“ Oh , come on . ”
106391	106425	106386	106386	Mimi	412	“ Felicity knew I was going to tell everyone — I’m the mean girl . I ’ve always been the mean girl . People are only friends with me because I intimidate them . ”
106426	106433	106434	106434	I	441	“ Tell you what , Mimi , ”
106437	106455	106434	106434	I	441	“ You stop trying to intimidate me , and I ’ll try being your friend for real . ”
106456	106459	106460	106460	She	412	“ Seriously ? ”
106466	106474	106460	106460	She	412	“ Can I come to your wedding ? ”
106475	106480	106434	106434	I	441	“ We ’ll see . ”
106481	106500	106501	106501	I	441	“ And will you cater my bridal shower ? I ca n’t stop thinking about those watermelon crostinis . ”
106504	106507	106501	106501	I	441	“ Sure . ”
106508	106514	106515	106515	She	412	“ And maybe . . . ”
106524	106548	106549	106549	I	441	“ Maybe you could give me the name of your stylist ? I ’ve been thinking about trying some little bangs like yours . ”
106554	106560	106561	106561	Mimi	412	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
106564	106574	106561	106561	Mimi	412	“ Actually , Mimi , I cut them myself . ”
106575	106582	106583	106583	She	412	“ You cut your own hair ? ”
106588	106612	106613	106613	I	441	“ Sometimes . It ’s a nervous habit , something I do when I feel like my life is out of my control . ”
106616	106628	106613	106613	I	441	“ I should n’t do it , but you know what ? ”
106629	106632	106657	106657	I	441	“ What ? ”
106633	106656	106657	106657	I	441	“ It ’s okay if I do . I do n’t have to be perfect . Or fashionable . Or even symmetrical . ”
106668	106680	106663	106663	his	148	“ I can just be me . And that ’s enough . ”
106685	106690	106691	106691	Millie	2105	“ Are you ready ? ”
106710	106713	106691	106691	Millie	2105	“ Definitely . ”
106722	106743	106714	106714	I	441	“ Do you think it ’s lame that I ’m wearing the same dress ? Everyone here will recognize it . ”
106744	106749	106750	106750	Winnie	58	“ Not at all , ”
106759	106781	106750	106750	Winnie	58	“ It ’s gorgeous on you , and this time you ’ve got the veil . That totally changes the look . ”
106857	106862	106863	106863	Millie	2105	“ Also the sneakers . ”
106870	106879	106863	106863	Millie	2105	“ It ’s a look all your own . ”
106887	106906	106880	106880	I	441	“ Yeah , I could n’t do those heels again . At least they ’re clean and white ! ”
106907	106923	106924	106924	Emmeline	56	“ You look amazing . You ca n’t even see the blood on the dress , ”
106931	106934	106928	106928	I	441	“ Thanks . ”
106975	106992	106967	106967	Audrey	57	“ And your hair is so cute . Good job staying away from the scissors today . ”
106993	106998	106999	106999	I	441	“ You know what ? ”
107008	107037	107038	107038	Hutton	148	“ Believe it or not , I was n’t even tempted . But I think Hutton took all the scissors out of the house yesterday just in case . ”
107229	107235	107221	107221	I	441	“ You all look beautiful , ”
107285	107303	107304	107304	Winnie	58	“ I could not be more proud to have all four of my sisters beside me today . ”
107309	107325	107304	107304	Winnie	58	“ Do n’t do this to me . My mascara is n’t even dry yet . ”
107326	107341	107342	107342	I	441	“ No tears ! We ’re all happy today . Have you seen Hutton ? ”
107351	107375	107346	107346	She	2105	“ He looks like a million — sorry — a billion bucks in his suit and tie , but also a little nervous . ”
107376	107390	107391	107391	I	441	“ Yeah , fifty pairs of eyes on him is not his thing , ”
107394	107403	107391	107391	I	441	“ He ’s definitely doing this for me . ”
107404	107414	107416	107416	Millie	2105	“ Honestly , Dad ’s probably a bigger mess , ”
107420	107428	107416	107416	Millie	2105	“ He keeps tearing up and pacing . ”
107429	107445	107447	107447	Winnie	58	“ He puts on such a tough front , but he ’s really a softie , ”
107449	107465	107447	107447	Winnie	58	“ Giving away one of his girls for the first time is probably killing him . ”
107466	107479	107480	107480	Millie	2105	“ If you ’re ready , Felicity , we should go down , ”
107483	107508	107447	107447	Winnie	58	“ Frannie ’s already been seated , and Dad ’s waiting outside . I do n’t think we should leave him alone too long . ”
107509	107514	107515	107515	I	441	“ Let ’s go , ”
107527	107532	107515	107515	I	441	“ I ’m ready . ”
107536	107546	107547	107547	Millie	2105	“ Just give it like two minutes , okay ? ”
107646	107649	107634	107634	she	2105	“ Okay . ”
107692	107704	107705	107705	His	411	“ Bet you never thought I ’d be first , huh ? ”
107716	107732	107705	107705	His	411	“ I never thought about this at all , or I ’d have fallen apart . ”
107740	107757	107705	107705	His	411	“ No fair , Dad . Do not make me ruin this moment with ugly tears . ”
107758	107761	107762	107762	He	411	“ Sorry . ”
107776	107851	107769	107769	I	441	“ I could n’t be happier for you , honey . It does n’t surprise me at all that you ’re first , because it ’s Hutton . Maybe if it had been a stranger , I ’d have questioned it . . . but you two have always been there for each other , and that ’s what marriage is . The fireworks are cool , but it ’s the friendship that matters . ”
107857	107864	107852	107852	I	441	“ I love you , Dad . ”
107865	107873	107874	107874	He	411	“ I love you too , sweetheart . ”
107892	107900	107883	107885	The Clipper Cuts	125	“ I think it ’s our turn . ”
107901	107907	107908	107908	We	1372	“ Let ’s do it . ”
108195	108199	108200	108200	I	441	“ Leave it , ”
108203	108209	108200	108200	I	441	“ I love an imperfection . ”
