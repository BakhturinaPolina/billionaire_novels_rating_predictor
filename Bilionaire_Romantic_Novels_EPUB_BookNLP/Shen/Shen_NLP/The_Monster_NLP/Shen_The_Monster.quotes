3198	3317	3318	3318	he	472	“ You ’ll fuck off from Boston . Move far away . And when I say far , Catalina , I mean somewhere he ca n’t see you . Where the memory of his deadbeat mother does n’t burn hot . Another planet is preferable , but since we ca n’t risk aliens meeting you and thinking we ’re all cunts , two states away minimum is my requirement . And if you ever come back — which I sincerely recommend against — you’ll go through me if you wanna see him . You walk away from him now , you lose all your motherly privileges . If I catch you messing with this kid , my kid … ”

3846	3868	3811	3811	I	140	“ You ’d be an idiot to fall asleep on a night like this , and my son is no idiot . ”

3966	4001	3949	3949	I	140	“ You ’d never give me the time of the day otherwise . You ca n’t let me hang out here just because Grandma Maria once scrubbed your toilets . Am I a bastard ? ”
4002	4015	4016	4016	Troy	94	“ You ’re not a bastard , and you ’re not mine , ”
4047	4053	3949	3949	I	140	“ Not biologically , anyway . ”

4160	4170	4171	4171	Sparrow	463	“ We do n’t want you to be perfect . ”
4179	4224	4171	4171	Sparrow	463	“ We just want you to be ours . You are Samuel . A gift from God . In the Bible , Samuel was gifted to Hannah after years of praying . She thought she was barren . Do you know what barren means ? ”
4225	4234	4235	4235	I	140	“ A woman who ca n’t have kids . ”
4281	4341	4278	4278	Sparrow	463	“ After Sailor was born , the doctors told me I could n’t conceive again . Turned out , I did n’t have to . I have you . Your name means ‘ The Lord Hears ’ in Hebrew . Shma - el . God heard my prayers and surpassed my every expectation . You ’re exquisite , Samuel . ”
4438	4461	4430	4430	she	494	“ Tell me why I ’m here . Why I ’m not in an orphanage . I ’m old enough to know , ”
4475	4505	4462	4462	I	140	“ And do n’t talk to me about the Bible . The Lord may have heard Hannah , but He sure as shit ai n’t been listening to me . ”
4506	4515	4516	4516	Sparrow	463	“ You ’re here because we love you , ”
4525	4535	4522	4522	Troy	94	“ You ’re here because I killed your father . ”
4571	4683	4684	4684	He	497	“ He said he deserves to know . He ’s not wrong , Red . The truth , Sam , is that shortly before your father died , he kidnapped Sparrow with every intention of killing her . I had to save my wife and did so without thinking twice . I wanted you to have a father figure . A person to look up to . The plan was to take you to basketball games every now and again . Provide guidance , advice , and a fat college fund to kick - start your life ; getting attached was never in my plans , but it happened , anyway . ”
4692	4708	4684	4684	He	497	“ Very early on I realized you were not a project . You were family . ”
4709	4715	4716	4716	I	140	“ You killed my father , ”
4739	4742	4743	4743	he	497	“ Yes , ”
4747	4751	4743	4743	he	497	“ Who knows ? ”
4752	4764	4772	4772	Troy	94	“ You . Me . Cat . Aunt Sparrow . God . ”
4765	4771	4772	4772	Troy	94	“ Did God forgive you ? ”
4775	4781	4772	4772	Troy	94	“ He gave me you . ”
4822	4826	4827	4827	Troy	94	“ All right ? ”
4839	4842	4831	4831	his	110	“ Aight ? ”
4856	4867	4868	4868	He	110	“ I ’m going to go get some dunks now . ”
4900	4903	4892	4892	He	110	“ businesses . ”
4904	4911	4912	4912	Sparrow	463	“ Donuts always make everything better , ”
4922	4928	4912	4912	Sparrow	463	“ Be safe , honey . ”
4940	4948	4949	4949	he	110	“ Always , Red . And you … ”
4957	4973	4949	4949	he	110	“ … no more cigarettes . This shit could send you to an early grave . ”
5050	5059	5060	5060	I	140	“ He did n’t want to take me , ”
5077	5100	5063	5063	She	463	“ No , he did n’t . But only because he did n’t want your mother to walk out of your life . ”
5101	5114	5063	5063	She	463	“ But you did n’t give a shit about that . Why ? ”
5115	5140	5063	5063	She	463	“ Because I know no mother is better than a bad mother , and every day you were with her made my heart hurt . ”
5141	5147	5063	5063	She	463	“ Grams left , too . ”
5148	5166	5063	5063	She	463	“ She did n’t leave , honey . She died . It was n’t up to her . ”
5167	5181	5063	5063	She	463	“ I do n’t care . I hate women . I hate them . ”
5182	5194	5195	5195	Sparrow	463	“ One day you ’ll find someone who changes your mind . ”
5268	5276	5277	5277	I	140	“ I will never change my mind , ”
5659	5663	5651	5651	her	510	“ Tres you ! ”
5855	5895	5846	5846	her	124	“ American girls show skin like men do n’t know what awaits under their garments . You , mon cheri , will make a man earn every inch of you , and dress appropriately and demurely , you hear ? ”
6555	6562	6563	6563	He	540	“ I want to get off . ”
6584	6617	6618	6618	he	540	“ Hell , sugar , I ’d like to get you off , too . But you ’ll have to wait till the end of my shift . I need the money , ”
6647	6669	6670	6670	Hope	134	“ No ! I want to get off the ride . Unless you can put someone in the cart with me ? ”
6676	6695	6670	6670	Hope	134	“ Bro , it ’s , like , a ride anyone four feet or over can get on . ”
6704	6712	6696	6696	He	540	“ You ’ll make it out alive . ”
6713	6728	6670	6670	Hope	134	“ I know . It ’s not that I ’m scared . I just — ”
6729	6732	6733	6733	he	540	“ Look … ”
6743	6772	6773	6773	I	140	“ … if I do n’t press that red button over there every three minutes , I lose my job . You getting out or sucking it up ? ”
6802	6816	6791	6791	someone	474	“ She ’ll suck it up , Sir Smokes - a - Lot . ”
7099	7105	7106	7106	I	140	“ I — I’m Aisling . ”
7182	7186	7169	7169	I	140	“ Bad night ? ”
7195	7199	7187	7187	His	137	“ The worst . ”
7212	7218	7187	7187	His	137	“ I highly doubt that . ”
7219	7240	7241	7241	He	137	“ Oh , I ’ll bet you anything my night is going worse than anyone else ’s in this carnival . ”
7269	7277	7261	7261	I	140	“ I would n’t bet with me . ”
7278	7285	7261	7261	I	140	“ Oh ? Why ’s that ? ”
7286	7291	7261	7261	I	140	“ I always win . ”
7292	7301	7302	7302	I	140	“ There ’s a first time for everything , ”
7318	7338	7308	7308	he	137	“ I bet you anything I ’m having the worst night out of all the people in this carnival . ”
7339	7346	7308	7308	he	137	“ Is that right ? Anything ? ”
7347	7351	7352	7352	I	140	“ Within reason . ”
7407	7417	7418	7418	He	557	“ I ’m guessing you ’re the sensible one . ”
7438	7445	7418	7418	He	557	“ One , out of … ? ”
7446	7450	7418	7418	He	557	“ Your siblings . ”
7451	7462	7463	7463	I	140	“ How do you know I have siblings at all ? ”
7612	7620	7621	7621	he	137	“ You think you ’re nothing special , ”
7625	7633	7621	7621	he	137	“ Do people think they ’re special ? ”
7634	7641	7621	7621	he	137	“ Those who are n’t do . ”
7642	7655	7656	7656	I	140	“ I ’m guessing you ’re the troublemaker out of your siblings . ”
7687	7690	7683	7683	he	137	“ Bingo . ”
7691	7701	7702	7702	I	140	“ You must ’ve been a hellion growing up . ”
7727	7744	7683	7683	he	137	“ I was such a troublemaker , my mother threw me out when I was nine . ”
7745	7752	7753	7753	I	140	“ Oh , I ’m sorry , ”
7757	7767	7753	7753	I	140	“ I ’m not . I dodged a bullet . ”
7768	7773	7683	7683	he	137	“ And your dad ? ”
7774	7779	7780	7781	The man	137	“ He did n’t . ”
7834	7844	7824	7825	Stoner Guy	137	“ He was shot when I was a kid . ”
7845	7848	7849	7849	I	140	“ Deservingly ? ”
7854	7859	7860	7861	Hot Stranger	140	“ Very much so . ”
7878	7884	7860	7861	Hot Stranger	140	“ How ’bout your folks ? ”
7885	7889	7860	7861	Hot Stranger	140	“ Both alive . ”
7890	7905	7906	7906	He	140	“ But someone else is n’t . Otherwise , you would n’t be crying . ”
7925	7931	7932	7932	I	140	“ I lost someone tonight , ”
7935	7938	7932	7932	I	140	“ Who ? ”
7939	7951	7963	7963	he	140	“ No offense , but that ’s none of your business . ”
7952	7962	7963	7963	he	140	“ None taken , but just for the record … ”
7974	8001	7963	7963	he	140	“ … everything in Suffolk County is my fucking business , sweetheart , and right now , you ’re within county limits , so think again . ”
8090	8099	8070	8074	A giant , plastic zombie	137	“ The monster ’s gon na get ya . ”
8153	8160	8145	8145	People	451	“ Do you ever feel lost ? ”
8235	8248	8289	8289	he	137	“ No . I had to find myself at a young age . ”
8249	8253	8289	8289	he	137	“ Lucky you . ”
8254	8265	8266	8266	He	137	“ I would n’t use that word to describe me . ”
8269	8275	8266	8266	He	137	“ Not Irish , then ? ”
8314	8323	8324	8324	he	137	“ Depends on how you look at it , ”
8327	8339	8324	8324	he	137	“ Back to the subject at hand — your being lost . ”
8340	8345	8346	8346	I	140	“ Yes , right . ”
8356	8390	8346	8346	I	140	“ I do n’t think I ’ll ever find myself . I do n’t have many friends . In fact , I only had one really true friend , and she died today . ”
8391	8436	8437	8437	His	137	“ There is nothing to find . Life is not about finding yourself . It ’s about creating yourself . There ’s something liberating about knowing your own bones , all the things you are capable of . Being unapologetically yourself makes you invincible . ”
8493	8499	8500	8500	I	140	“ And who are you ? ”
8503	8509	8500	8500	I	140	“ I ’m a monster . ”
8510	8515	8516	8516	I	140	“ No , really , ”
8519	8556	8557	8557	We	574	“ It ’s true . I thrive in the dark . My job is to implement fear , and I am some people ’s nightmare . Like all monsters , I always take what I want . ”
8566	8581	8557	8557	We	574	“ And what I want right now , Aisling , is to kiss you . ”
8827	8830	8819	8825	The girls in the cart behind us	584	“ holy shit ”
8832	8836	8819	8825	The girls in the cart behind us	584	“ that was hot ”
8838	8848	8849	8849	Him	137	“ yeah , it ’s definitely him , Tiff . ”
8852	8858	8859	8859	He	137	“ First kiss , huh ? ”
8893	8902	8903	8906	The girls behind us	586	“ You ’ll get the hang of it . ”
8931	8943	8944	8944	My	140	“ Are you seriously not going to tell me your name ? ”
8955	8988	8950	8950	I	140	“ Imagine if you really were my first kiss . I could be scarred for life . You might traumatize me . I ’d never be able to trust another man again . ”
9004	9012	9013	9014	The stranger	137	“ Time ’s up . Everybody out . ”
9023	9028	9029	9029	he	137	“ You ’ll survive , ”
9032	9039	9029	9029	he	137	“ Do n’t be so sure . ”
9040	9067	9029	9029	he	137	“ Do n’t underestimate me . I know a whole fucking lot about people . Besides , I already told you , my name is Monster . ”
9068	9077	9078	9078	I	140	“ Now , that might be your nickname — ”
9081	9090	9091	9091	I	140	“ Nicknames are more telling than birth names . ”

9372	9392	9367	9367	he	140	“ Maybe you ’re one of us . You just said yourself you do n’t know who you are . ”
10061	10084	10085	10085	Someone	474	“ No , no , no . Please . I know I fucked up , but I promise , I ’ll stop . ”

10251	10258	10259	10260	the man	2914	“ One last wish , Mason , ”
10338	10366	10328	10328	He	2914	“ If Nikki asks , tell her it was drug - related . I do n’t want her to know the truth . She ’s suffered enough . ”
10367	10373	10328	10328	He	2914	“ I will . Goodbye . ”
10657	10674	10634	10634	He	441	“ You ’re having one hell of a night , are n’t you , little Aisling . ”
10687	10694	10695	10695	I	140	“ I did n’t see anything , ”
10737	10747	10748	10748	He	441	“ Now you believe that I ’m a monster ? ”
10881	10892	10893	10893	He	441	“ Are you actually going to let me kiss you ? ”

10973	10988	10965	10965	His	441	“ Guess you found yourself , then . You ’re a monster , too . ”
11004	11051	11055	11055	he	441	“ Tell anyone about this , and I will find you , and I will kill you , too . Now , I suggest you run . Far and fast . I ’m giving you a two - minute head start before coming after your ass . ”
11561	11574	11552	11552	Her	654	“ Yup . That ’s her . My ball - busting roommate , ”

11660	11669	11670	11670	I	140	“ I ’m guessing those are her parents . ”
11683	11688	11680	11680	He	615	“ And these two ? ”
11733	11761	11724	11724	I	140	“ Persephone and Emmabelle . Her best friends . They ’re sisters . Another bucket list dream I ca n’t fulfill because Sailor is on my case . ”
11762	11777	11724	11724	I	140	“ What do you mean ? What do you want to do to them ? ”
11778	11785	11786	11786	He	668	“ I want to do them . ”
11801	11808	11786	11786	He	668	“ And who is this guy ? ”
11933	11939	11924	11924	I	140	“ That ’s Sam Brennan . ”
11952	12017	11940	11940	Hunter	615	“ Her brother . Well , adoptive brother , I guess . Her parents adopted him when she was barely a toddler . A real piece of work and the current number one mobster in Boston . All the gangs and mafia families on the East Coast have a bounty on his head .

12103	12150	12090	12091	My mother	2875	“ Come on , you know I do n’t do small talk very well . You ’ll need to save me from mingling . Especially with the matriarch . She works for a living . You know I do n’t do well with the middle class . ”
12418	12427	12430	12430	father	2904	“ And this is my daughter , Aisling . ”
12482	12488	12489	12489	I	140	“ Pleasure to meet you , ”
12513	12539	12499	12499	Cillian	128	“ Do n’t even look at her , Mr. Brennan . Aisling is prime rib . Not a hotdog and therefore not on your menu . ”
12540	12546	12547	12547	Mother	2875	“ Cillian , for shame . ”
12591	12606	12607	12608	The man	560	“ May I offer you and your wife a tour of Avebury Court Manor ? ”

13038	13044	13045	13045	he	560	“ You ’re awfully slow , ”
13060	13066	13048	13048	His	560	“ You ’re awfully rude . ”

13138	13147	13129	13129	I	140	“ I had a bad night that night . ”
13148	13156	13157	13157	He	560	“ That does n’t answer my question . ”
13166	13180	13181	13181	Sam	560	“ Hurry up . And remember , Brennan , I ’m watching you . ”
13197	13205	13181	13181	Sam	560	“ Like what you see , Fitzpatrick ? ”
13206	13211	13212	13212	Cillian	128	“ Not even remotely . ”
13217	13250	13212	13212	Cillian	128	“ A word to the wise : I do n’t like being told what to do , but for the right price , I can be motivated into doing just about anything . ”
13251	13259	13260	13260	Cillian	128	“ And you ’re proud of that ? ”
13263	13292	13260	13260	Cillian	128	“ Immensely . You ’ll be lining up for my services the minute Daddy is n’t able to pull you out of whatever bullshit you get yourself into . ”
13293	13300	13301	13301	Cillian	128	“ Do n’t hold your breath , ”
13323	13330	13331	13331	I	140	“ My brother is a character , ”
13335	13358	13359	13359	I	140	“ That ’s just a nice way of calling someone an asshole . Sailor tells me you ’re going to med school . ”
13363	13366	13359	13359	I	140	“ Why ? ”
13367	13374	13359	13359	I	140	“ I want to help people . ”
13375	13382	13383	13383	We	708	“ No , you do n’t . ”

13518	13640	13641	13641	I	140	“ I ’m starting to see that . Listen carefully now . Your daddy is a very rich and important man , and I ’m a very ambitious and a very bad man . I want his business , and nothing is going to stand in my way , least of all you . So stay the fuck away from me and do n’t give me those puppy eyes , begging to be fucked right there in front of your entire immediate family , like you are doing right now . You have no idea what you ’re asking for . Men like me eat girls like you for breakfast . And not in a pleasurable way . You got that ? ”
13703	13708	13709	13709	He	560	“ Yes . But … ”
13726	13729	13730	13730	he	560	“ Yes ? ”
13735	13740	13741	13741	I	140	“ One last kiss , ”
13744	13757	13758	13758	He	560	“ I wo n’t tell . You know I ’d never tell . ”
13772	13776	13777	13777	he	560	“ One kiss , ”
13785	13804	13777	13777	he	560	“ One last measly , stupid kiss . And do n’t you dare come back for more again . ”
13910	13915	13904	13904	He	560	“ You ’re feral . ”
13916	13920	13921	13921	I	140	“ I know , ”
13924	13929	13921	13921	I	140	“ I ’m sorry . ”
13930	13940	13945	13945	he	560	“ Do n’t be . I fucking love it . ”
14044	14054	14055	14055	I	140	“ I feel like I ’m … I ’m … ”
14105	14108	14109	14109	he	560	“ Empty ? ”
14120	14132	14109	14109	he	560	“ Yes . That ’s it . I feel so empty . ”
14133	14145	14115	14115	his	560	“ I wish I could fill you with my fat cock . ”
14146	14149	14150	14150	I	140	“ Oh , ”
14172	14185	14153	14153	he	560	“ God … I ’m … I mean , am I … ? ”
14248	14254	14255	14255	He	560	“ I think you did . ”
14284	14287	14288	14288	I	140	“ Huh , ”
14294	14299	14288	14288	I	140	“ La petite mort . ”
14311	14317	14300	14300	He	560	“ Say what , now ? ”
14318	14323	14324	14324	I	140	“ La petite mort , ”
14327	14352	14324	14324	I	140	“ A brief unconsciousness . A little death , in French . That ’s what they call that beat after an orgasm , sometimes . ”
14394	14405	14406	14406	He	560	“ You , Aisling Fitzpatrick , are a lovely torture . ”
14432	14441	14424	14424	I	140	“ Oh gosh , what did we do ? ”
14458	14473	14452	14452	he	560	“ I assume that was rhetorical , so I ’ll spare you the answer . ”
14487	14494	14495	14495	I	140	“ Do you have a girlfriend ? ”
14511	14524	14499	14499	He	560	“ Do n’t worry about my having girlfriends . I never will . ”
14525	14529	14499	14499	He	560	“ Why not ? ”
14530	14559	14560	14560	He	560	“ Because no woman is worth it , least of all one that is the spawn of a man I ’d like to bleed dry of his money . ”
14581	14594	14595	14595	I	140	“ You know , I would never tell if we hooked up . ”
14634	14645	14618	14618	He	560	“ I just told you this was our last kiss . ”
14646	14650	14651	14651	I	140	“ But why ? ”
14654	14663	14651	14651	I	140	“ Because I want your father ’s business . ”
14664	14670	14618	14618	He	560	“ I wo n’t tell . ”
14671	14679	14680	14680	He	560	“ You ’re not worth the risk . ”
14689	14696	14697	14697	I	140	“ There will be no risk , ”
14744	14783	14736	14736	Sam	560	“ Even without the risk , you ’re not worth it . You are too young , too innocent , and far too sweet for me . Now do your self - respect a favor and walk away . ”
14813	14820	14821	14821	I	140	“ I feel sorry for you , ”
14838	14842	14843	14843	He	560	“ You do ? ”
14849	14852	14843	14843	He	560	“ Why ? ”
14853	14892	14901	14901	His	560	“ Because you ’re a half - literate , barely educated dropout . You probably do n’t even know the multiplication table . That ’s why you do what you do . You do n’t have a choice . ”
14893	14900	14901	14901	His	560	“ You ’re calling me dumb ? ”
14911	14916	14917	14917	I	140	“ You are dumb . ”
14923	14955	14917	14917	I	140	“ But it ’s okay . You ’re hot and ooze that look - at - me - I’m - dangerous vibe , so I ’m sure you ’ll find someone . ”
14956	14962	14963	14963	He	560	“ Do n’t forget rich . ”
14968	14974	14975	14975	I	140	“ Not by my standards , ”
14992	15008	14985	14986	my mother	2875	“ Just try not to make conversation . You ’re not very good at it . ”
15009	15041	15042	15042	His	560	“ Based on you dry humping my leg like a bitch in heat five seconds ago , I ’m sure I ’ll be able to keep them entertained some other way . ”
15059	15066	15048	15048	his	560	“ You … you … you … ”
15067	15079	15080	15080	He	560	“ I ’m … I ’m … I ’m … what ? ”
15095	15098	15080	15080	He	560	“ Right ? ”
15219	15236	15207	15207	I	140	“ I ’ll try solving you tomorrow . I have bigger problems to work out now . ”
15298	15305	15295	15295	he	560	“ Are you calling me dumb ? ”
15465	15488	15461	15462	the bouncer	737	“ Boss showed your picture around , jailbait . Said he ’ll fire anyone who ’s dumb enough to let you in . ”
15552	15588	15589	15589	Emmabelle	138	“ I ca n’t believe they did n’t ID you , bitch . Sam ’s gon na shit so many bricks , he ’ll be able to build a replica of the Empire State Building ! ”

15979	15994	15963	15963	She	167	“ Anyway , Sam ’s an asshole for blacklisting you in the first place . ”
15995	16035	16036	16036	I	140	“ Sam ’s an asshole for many reasons , none of them have anything to do with blacklisting me , but banning me from his club for no apparent reason just shows how much of a tyrant he is , ”
16075	16091	16092	16092	Belle	167	“ Do you think he did it because you are Hunter and Kill ’s sister ? ”
16095	16116	16117	16117	I	140	“ No , I think he did it because I remind him of all the things he wants to forget , ”
16484	16490	16491	16491	Belle	167	“ Forget about Sam tonight . ”
16548	16588	16529	16529	Feline	175	“ You have n’t gone out once since you started your residency at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital . That was over six months ago . Find yourself a hookup . Have fun . You earned it , Doc . ”
16589	16596	16597	16597	I	140	“ I do n’t do hookups , ”
16616	16671	16529	16529	Feline	175	“ Time to change that . It makes no sense that an OB - GYN in training — a woman who literally takes care of everyone else ’s vagina — does not care for her own . You ca n’t pine for an unrequited penis . There are plenty of fish in the sea . ”
16672	16700	16701	16701	I	140	“ Well , I sincerely hope you do n’t get mercury poisoning , Belle , because you seem to enjoy sampling said fish a bit too much . ”
16732	16792	16720	16720	Belle	167	“ Oh , Ash , you are a hoot . That ’s the thing most people do n’t know about you . Underneath the polished exterior , the American Princess longs for the monster to steal her , not for the prince to save her . You ’re kind of a dangerous creature , when you want to be . ”
16873	16879	16867	16867	I	140	“ Runnin ’ with the Devil ”
17098	17136	17089	17089	She	167	“ We ’re going to the Four Seasons . He ’s got a friend in management who can hook us up with a presidential suite . Does n’t he give Antonio Banderas a run for his money ? ”
17189	17202	17179	17179	I	140	“ Definitely , but the costume ’s a bit cheesy , no ? ”
17203	17224	17225	17225	Belle	167	“ Cheesier than Domino ’s pizza . Luckily , I ’m spending one night with him , not a lifetime . ”
17235	17259	17260	17260	She	167	“ Happy Halloween , Doc . Make sure you do n’t leave here alone and text me if you need anything , yeah ? ”
17458	17463	17452	17452	he	796	“ I ’m Chris . ”
17563	17566	17567	17567	I	140	“ Ash , ”
17597	17606	17607	17607	He	133	“ You look hot as fuck , Ash . ”
17618	17621	17607	17607	He	133	“ Thanks . ”
17633	17641	17622	17622	I	140	“ Can I buy you a drink ? ”
17663	17674	17660	17660	I	140	“ Anything bottled works . I ’ll open it myself . ”
17675	17684	17660	17660	I	140	“ You do n’t have a bottle opener . ”
17685	17690	17691	17691	I	140	“ I have teeth , ”
17705	17709	17698	17698	He	133	“ Right on . ”
17722	17726	17728	17731	the Yeah Yeah Yeahs	185	“ Heads Will Roll ”
17815	17830	17831	17831	I	140	“ It ’s been fun , Chris . Thanks . Have a good night . ”
17873	17890	17864	17864	his	183	“ Not so quick , Pretty Woman . Where ’s my thank you for the beer ? ”
17957	17975	17976	17976	I	140	“ Here . Buy yourself something nice . Maybe the common sense not to sexually harass women . ”
18022	18035	18010	18010	his	183	“ Nuh uh . I have something else in mind for payment . ”
18036	18053	18066	18066	He	183	“ Then I suggest you rethink it , because I ’m not that type of girl . ”
18054	18065	18066	18066	He	183	“ Is that why you ’re dressed like a whore ? ”
18072	18093	18066	18066	He	183	“ Spare me the speech , Ashley . We both want each other , and it ’s going to happen . ”
18219	18233	18234	18234	Sam	560	“ Get rid of him , but not before breaking a few bones , ”
18259	18264	18265	18265	Chris	183	“ Oh , man , ”
18284	18303	18265	18265	Chris	183	“ Sorry . I did n’t know she was a VIP . C’m on , Brennan . Please ! ”
18304	18308	18309	18309	Sam	560	“ Shut up , ”
18312	18320	18321	18321	Chris	183	“ Am I banned from the club ? ”
18330	18359	18360	18360	He	183	“ By the time my men finish with you , you ’ll be lucky not to piss blood for the rest of your life . Take him out . ”
18459	18463	18464	18464	he	183	“ Follow me , ”
18468	18475	18464	18464	he	183	“ I ’m sorry ! I … ”
18841	18846	18833	18833	I	140	“ Look , I — ”
18867	18924	18858	18858	he	560	“ What happened to you tonight is not a representation of my club or the people inside it . I know things can get rowdy in here , but sexual harassment is where we draw the line . I ’d like to offer you a hundred - dollar voucher for your troubles , Miss … Roberts . ”
19111	19121	19122	19122	I	140	“ Who said I did n’t want the attention ? ”
19160	19204	19205	19205	He	560	“ Your body language did , for one thing . Some read books , I read people . You tried tugging your arm free , the international signal for get - the - fuck - away . I noticed you on the monitor . ”
19242	19268	19233	19233	I	140	“ You ’re right . He was n’t my type . But that does n’t mean I did n’t come here to get some action . ”
19269	19274	19275	19275	he	560	“ Is that so ? ”
19280	19283	19275	19275	he	560	“ Yes . ”
19359	19371	19372	19372	His	560	“ Better get out there and try your luck , then . ”
19384	19393	19372	19372	His	560	“ Or maybe we could help each other . ”
19426	19435	19418	19418	Sam	560	“ Who said I ’m on the prowl ? ”
19436	19441	19418	19418	Sam	560	“ Your blood type . ”
19442	19449	19418	19418	Sam	560	“ You know my blood type ? ”
19450	19455	19456	19456	I	140	“ Hot - blooded , ”
19459	19472	19456	19456	I	140	“ Hot or cold , you ca n’t handle me , sweetheart . ”
19473	19477	19478	19478	His	560	“ Try me . ”
19542	19546	19547	19547	he	560	“ Turn around , ”
19608	19615	19616	19616	His	560	“ Lift your skirt for me . ”
19678	19684	19671	19671	him	560	“ Get out of here . ”
19705	19712	19713	19713	I	140	“ I know men like you , ”
19717	19725	19713	19713	I	140	“ There are no men like me . ”
19726	19735	19736	19736	I	140	“ I can make it good for you , ”
19739	19743	19744	19744	He	560	“ Doubt that . ”
19753	19756	19744	19744	He	560	“ Out . ”
19803	19806	19807	19807	I	140	“ Please … ”
19927	19931	19932	19932	I	140	“ May I ? ”
19954	19968	19942	19942	He	560	“ Make it fucking good , Roberts . I do n’t fuck rookies . ”
20220	20223	20224	20224	he	2914	“ Motherfucker , ”
20227	20233	20224	20224	he	2914	“ That ’s some move . ”
20318	20324	20308	20308	He	2914	“ Got anything against dicks ? ”
20325	20330	20331	20331	My	140	“ Not at all . ”
20338	20364	20331	20331	My	140	“ Sorry . It ’s just that my hair is a mess under the wig , and I do n’t want you to see it . ”
20377	20394	20331	20331	My	140	“ Are you under the impression we ’re about to have our fucking wedding photos taken ? ”
20404	20410	20331	20331	My	140	“ Who the fuck cares ? ”
20411	20422	20423	20424	Silly girl	853	“ No , you ’re right , of course not . ”
20440	20456	20457	20457	He	2914	“ While we ’re at it , why do n’t you take off the sunglasses ? ”
20462	20475	20457	20457	He	2914	“ Makes me feel like I ’m getting head from Stevie Wonder . ”
20532	20540	20515	20515	I	140	“ Nice diversion , Roberts . Faster . ”
20641	20664	20665	20665	I	140	“ All right , let ’s see what your cunt or ass is made of . On your feet , Pretty Woman . ”
20744	20747	20733	20733	Sam	560	“ What ? ”
20784	20789	20759	20759	I	140	“ What , what ? ”
20790	20793	20794	20794	he	2914	“ Ginger , ”
20798	20802	20794	20794	he	2914	“ And honey . ”
20803	20806	20807	20807	I	140	“ Ginger ? ”
20814	20820	20807	20807	I	140	“ What do you mean ? ”
20821	20836	20837	20837	Me	140	“ There ’s only one woman I know who smells of ginger and honey . ”
20978	20981	20982	20982	he	2914	“ Fitzpatrick , ”
20988	20993	20994	20994	I	140	“ Sam , I — ”
21001	21008	20999	20999	Merde	147	“ Please . Just one time . ”
21009	21044	21045	21045	he	2914	“ Spare me the bullshit . I ’ll deal with you later . First , I ’ll give you what you ’ve been begging for for over a decade and remind you why you … ”
21050	21054	21055	21055	he	2914	“ … do … ”
21083	21087	21088	21088	he	2914	“ … not … ”
21097	21101	21102	21102	he	2914	“ … fuck … ”
21144	21149	21150	21150	He	2914	“ … with me . ”
21313	21321	21322	21322	he	2914	“ Are you a virgin , Aisling ? ”
21406	21411	21400	21400	he	137	“ Would it matter ? ”
21456	21463	21433	21434	this man	137	“ Not in the fucking slightest . ”
21464	21474	21475	21475	My	140	“ Then I suggest you find out for yourself . ”
21569	21605	21560	21560	Sam	560	“ So fucking smug . If you want to be taken , you ’ll be taken the Sam Brennan way . No regrets . No repeats . And no fucking telling your parents , kiddo . ”
21762	21769	21770	21770	He	560	“ Not a virgin , then . ”
22064	22088	22089	22089	Sam	98	“ Well , well , little Aisling Fitzpatrick is all grown up , and she knows how to fuck like a porn star . ”
22203	22222	22195	22195	him	98	“ Your pussy might be used , but this asshole has never been fucked . I can tell . ”
22282	22306	22310	22310	he	98	“ You had to leave me a first to take , did n’t you , Aisling Fitzpatrick ? You poor , romantic soul . ”
22422	22427	22428	22428	I	140	“ I ’m coming , ”
22582	22602	22603	22603	I	140	“ Get the fuck up , ice princess . My grand vintage billiard table is not meant for sleep . ”
22650	22654	22655	22655	I	140	“ Ask nicely , ”
22676	22681	22655	22655	I	140	“ And I might . ”
22682	22705	22706	22706	Sam	98	“ I never do anything nicely . You should know by now . Where ’d you learn all your little bed tricks ? ”
22746	22752	22732	22732	He	98	“ You mean , fuck ? ”
22770	22821	22762	22762	I	140	“ Do n’t forget I spent seven years among people whose sole purpose in life was studying the human body . I had some pretty good time exploring all the ways to make a person scream in pleasure … and pain . You have n’t seen the half of it . ”
23007	23021	23022	23022	Sam	560	“ That ’s more than I wanted to know about you , kid , ”
23047	23061	23062	23062	He	560	“ What are you doing these days , anyway ? Pediatrician , right ? ”
23065	23076	23077	23077	I	140	“ OB - GYN . Brigham and Women ’s Hospital , ”
23107	23119	23120	23120	he	560	“ You really thought you could seduce me by dressing up ? ”
23126	23134	23135	23135	I	140	“ I did , did n’t I ? ”
23143	23159	23135	23135	I	140	“ Honestly ? I dressed like this to get in , not to seduce you . ”
23160	23169	23170	23170	His	560	“ Why did you want to get in ? ”
23178	23188	23170	23170	His	560	“ Because Badlands is the hottest place in Boston . ”
23189	23201	23202	23202	he	560	“ You do n’t care about the hottest places in Boston , ”
23206	23212	23213	23213	I	140	“ Of course I do , ”
23230	23240	23170	23170	His	560	“ Sometimes even good girls want to be bad . ”
23241	23256	23257	23257	he	560	“ Which is why you were banned from this establishment in the first place , ”
23260	23265	23257	23257	he	560	“ That ’s unfair . ”
23266	23293	23170	23170	His	560	“ Fair and I do n’t even share the same fucking planet . Which part of my character made you think I care about being fair ? ”
23347	23383	23384	23384	I	140	“ I ’m banned from your establishment because you know if I get too close , you ’d actually have to pay attention to me , and every time we ’re together , magic happens , ”
23428	23461	23412	23412	Sam	560	“ The only magic we shared today was that I made your asshole about an inch wider for life . Regardless of that , you pulled a dirty move , Miss Fitzpatrick . ”
23462	23480	23481	23481	I	140	“ We monsters do what we have to do . You know that better than I do . ”
23484	23490	23491	23491	he	560	“ You ’re no monster , ”
23494	23505	23491	23491	he	560	“ You have no idea who or what I am . ”
23506	23515	23516	23516	he	560	“ What was your objective ? One fuck ? ”
23519	23534	23535	23535	I	140	“ One ? No . A few ? Sure , depending on your attitude , ”
23596	23599	23600	23600	he	560	“ Aisling , ”
23633	23714	23618	23618	I	140	“ If we fuck — and that ’s an if , not a when — that ’s all we ’ll be doing . Every single thing you were born and bred to achieve — a respectable husband , children , a family , a Labrador to complete your Christmas photo — I rejected before you were even born . It will be just that . Fucking . And no one could ever know about our arrangement , for obvious reasons . ”
23912	23920	23909	23910	mon cheri	198	“ What do you have in mind ? ”
23950	23999	23937	23937	Sam	560	“ Well , we ca n’t fuck around in your place since you still live with your parents — what the hell is that all about , anyway?—and I never let anyone into my apartment , so I guess you can meet me here tomorrow . Same time . ”
24000	24005	24006	24006	I	140	“ Why not there ? ”
24010	24013	24014	24014	He	886	“ Huh ? ”
24027	24038	24014	24014	He	886	“ Why do n’t you let anyone into your apartment ? ”
24039	24045	24046	24046	he	886	“ Because I hate everyone , ”
24067	24073	24061	24061	I	140	“ Why the fuck else ? ”
24074	24085	24014	24014	He	886	“ So no one ’s ever been in your apartment ? ”
24086	24115	24116	24116	He	886	“ My parents visited once or twice . Sailor knows the address but is not allowed to come there . Why do you still live with your parents ? ”
24134	24154	24125	24125	I	140	“ I do n’t see the point of paying for a place when I basically live at the hospital . ”
24155	24200	24201	24201	he	886	“ Do n’t act like living in your own apartment would require you to wash a mug . You ’re too rich to do shit yourself , and you and I both know that . Why are you still hiding behind Mommy and Daddy ? ”
24267	24279	24280	24280	I	140	“ Does that mean I ’m no longer banned from Badlands ? ”
24283	24337	24280	24280	I	140	“ Oh , you ’re still banned , missy . I do n’t want to see you partying with these losers . One of the bouncers will show you through the back door when you get here tomorrow , but you ’re not allowed at the bar or any of the card rooms . ”
24338	24345	24380	24380	Nix	140	“ See you tomorrow , Monster . ”
24346	24349	24350	24350	he	140	“ Nix , ”
24502	24550	24551	24551	Cat	97	“ Just thought y’ all should know . What with the fact that they ’re gon na knock the whole thang down next week . Not that the property ’s worth a dime , mind you . But I thought , why not let her son know ? ”
24643	24651	24652	24652	I	140	“ How ’d you get my number ? ”
24669	24680	24652	24652	I	140	“ Your daddy gave it to me . Troy somethin’ . ”
24709	24735	24738	24738	my	140	“ Well , I appreciate the heads - up , but I ca n’t imagine there ’s anything in this house of value to me . ”
25033	25045	25046	25051	The woman on the other line	904	“ Are n’t you gon na ask how she passed away ? ”
25106	25123	25124	25124	he	905	“ Air bike and ropes next . You ’ve got sixty seconds to recover , Monster , ”
25157	25164	25165	25171	the Southern woman on the other line	904	“ Hello ? You still there ? ”
25188	25244	25179	25179	I	140	“ Listen , Mrs. Masterson , I appreciate your motherly concern , but to say Cat and I were n’t close would be the understatement of the fucking century . There ’s nothing I need from her place . I ’m a busy man . I do n’t have time to go down to Georgia . ”
25473	25488	25489	25490	Mrs. Masterson	201	“ Drugs . She had an overdose . That ’s how she passed away , ”
25503	25601	25489	25490	Mrs. Masterson	201	“ Poor thang . Girl Scouts found her . Came to try to sell her some cookies . Would you believe ? They looked through the window . Saw her lying on the floor and called 9 - 1 - 1 . Poor children . No one ought to see somethin’ like that , let alone kiddies . They say she ’d been like that for days . Maybe a week . No one came to check on her . Her phone log said no one even called . She was a lonely woman , your mother . ”
25658	25672	25673	25679	the old woman on the other line	97	“ Look , I know you two were n’t exactly thick as thieves … ”
25681	25692	25673	25679	the old woman on the other line	97	“ … still , son , you should be here . ”
25693	25698	25673	25679	the old woman on the other line	97	“ I ’m not — ”
25699	25723	25724	25724	she	97	“ Boy , I do n’t know how to be clearer than I am . There ’s something of hers you should see , ”
25730	25809	25724	25724	she	97	“ Let ’s leave it at that , shall we ? She told me you were a rich man . That means you can afford to take the time off work and get your ass down here , mister . I know I ’m old , but I ai n’t stupid . I do n’t mean you should come here to pick up some Walmart china or family albums . There are some things you need to see . ”
25819	25823	25724	25724	she	97	“ Like what ? ”
25824	25831	25724	25724	she	97	“ I ai n’t tellin ’ . ”
25832	25849	25724	25724	she	97	“ You ’re an infuriating woman , Mrs. Masterson . Has anyone ever told you that ? ”
25850	25856	25857	25857	She	97	“ All the damn time . ”
25875	25886	25867	25867	she	97	“ So , is that a yes , little Greystone ? ”
25887	25890	25891	25891	I	140	“ Brennan , ”
26045	26054	26036	26036	I	140	“ I ’ll be there by tomorrow morning . ”
26055	26061	26062	26062	I	140	“ Smart move , boy . ”
26085	26120	26078	26078	him	912	“ There ’s actually a flight going out of Boston Logan Airport in a few hours . Better catch that one , ’cause there ’s thunderstorms rolling in tomorrow and there could be delays . ”
26121	26125	26126	26126	I	140	“ Book it , ”
26386	26389	26390	26390	He	203	“ Ready ? ”
26410	26413	26398	26398	I	140	“ Always . ”
26895	26902	26903	26903	Sparrow	463	“ What ’s up , Sam ? ”
26946	26964	26936	26936	her	463	“ Sparrow . I ’m at Cat ’s place in Georgia . She died of an overdose . ”
26965	26969	26970	26970	she	463	“ Troy said , ”
26992	27013	27014	27014	I	140	“ I think there ’s something here I should see , but I ’m not sure where to find it . ”
27075	27097	27072	27072	she	463	“ Check the nightstand drawers or the little nooks in her closet . That ’s where women usually stash their secrets . ”
27098	27108	27072	27072	she	463	“ Done , and also duly noted . Nothing . ”
27109	27117	27072	27072	she	463	“ Ripped the carpets and floor up ? ”
27118	27124	27125	27125	I	140	“ Every inch of them , ”
27143	27148	27141	27141	them	941	“ Any other ideas ? ”
27149	27157	27158	27158	I	140	“ Are there any pictures hanging there ? ”
27248	27251	27252	27252	I	140	“ One , ”
27265	27275	27276	27276	Sparrow	463	“ Rip it . It ’ll be behind it , ”
27281	27291	27276	27276	Sparrow	463	“ This is why I do n’t trust women . ”
27292	27310	27311	27311	she	463	“ That ’s okay . We do n’t trust men right back . Oh and , Sam ? ”
27322	27325	27326	27326	I	140	“ Mmm ? ”
27362	27425	27358	27358	my	140	“ I ’m sorry for your loss . And I know you do n’t see it as a loss , I do , but I can not find joy in knowing the woman who created you has passed away . Because at the end of the day — she gave me you . And I love you so very much , son . ”
29995	30010	29978	29979	Grandma Maria	101	“ Call an ambulance . I have to get to the hospital . Now . ”
30770	30776	30777	30777	I	140	“ Good riddance , sweetheart . ”
30817	30853	30854	30854	I	140	“ You know , Cat , I thought about killing you often enough . Every other month , maybe . There is something poetic in taking a life from the person who gave you one , ”
30877	30972	30973	30973	I	140	“ But then it all boiled down to the same thing : killing a person is taking a risk . You were never worth the risk . That ’s your life story in a nutshell , is n’t it , Catalina ? Never more than an afterthought . So many lovers , and fake friends , and fiancés , and even a husband , yet no one has ever visited your grave . Only an eighty - five - year - old neighbor who would find Stalin lovable . I guess it ’s goodbye . ”
31014	31024	31025	31025	Troy	952	“ Do not let this spin out of control , ”
31114	31126	31102	31102	his	952	“ How did you even find this prehistoric piece of evidence ? ”
31127	31135	31136	31136	I	140	“ I ’m a very resourceful man , ”
31139	31143	31136	31136	I	140	“ No shit . ”
31300	31315	31294	31294	he	754	“ Remember your sister is married to Gerald ’s son . We ’re family . ”
31647	31663	31664	31664	I	140	“ This is not going to touch Sailor , Hunter , Rooney , or Xander , ”
31697	31706	31707	31707	Troy	952	“ Hunter ’s gon na blow a gasket , ”
31710	31739	31740	31740	I	140	“ Hunter ’s too busy creating his own family to give a fuck about the one who turned their back on him when he was in boarding school , ”
31775	31804	31765	31765	they	127	“ I ’m not going to spare the feelings of every motherfucker I ’ve ever had a beer with . Hunter’ll survive . Gerald has earned my wrath . ”
31805	31831	31832	31832	Troy	952	“ As far as I ’m concerned , Gerald can get your wrath , too . I have no dog in this fight , Sam . ”
31906	31935	31898	31898	I	140	“ I just want to make sure you do n’t do anything too impulsive . I know you , son . You ’ve always been trigger - happy . ”
31936	31947	31948	31948	I	140	“ Not as happy as I ’d like to be . ”
31967	32017	32021	32021	his	140	“ Which brings us to the next topic . I caught the Russians smuggling a hundred and thirty pounds of hashish into one of their delis . Whatever Vasily Mikhailov sold — and it was not fucking pastrami — he did n’t hand over a cut from the earnings . ”
32072	32100	32101	32101	He	1073	“ Do n’t get me started about the Russians . You had no business taking over their territory in the first place . Back to Gerald Fitzpatrick . ”
32114	32134	32101	32101	He	1073	“ I want you to sit on this information until we confirm it . I know it looks bad — ”
32135	32140	32141	32141	I	140	“ It ’s airtight , ”
32145	32153	32141	32141	I	140	“ I have proof . Hard facts . ”
32225	32229	32230	32230	he	110	“ And still … ”
32239	32304	32230	32230	he	110	“ … you know something he thinks you do n’t know . You have the upper hand now . Operate within the scope of your role , but do n’t turn this into the Red fucking Wedding . I know you , Sam . You enjoy delivering slow deaths much more than fast killings . Torture him , but do n’t finish him completely . ”
32394	32397	32398	32398	I	140	“ Fine , ”
32408	32427	32398	32398	I	140	“ I suppose I could torture him a little . But I will go for the throat eventually . ”
32428	32460	32461	32461	Troy	952	“ Eventually is still at least a few months away , and I hope I can stumble across some information that will make you change your mind between now and then . ”
32606	32610	32611	32611	He	952	“ You good ? ”
32626	32635	32621	32621	I	140	“ Why the fuck would n’t I be ? ”
32636	32639	32611	32611	He	952	“ Cat — ”
32640	32699	32621	32621	I	140	“ Was , like her namesake , just another pussy . I do n’t consider her death an event worth mentioning . The awful apple pie I had to endure from her nagging neighbor next door caused me more discomfort than knowing she had been left to rot in her apartment for a week before people found out . ”
32700	32703	32704	32704	His	952	“ Arright … ”
32718	32742	32621	32621	I	140	“ Do n’t get too wild with your revenge plot against Gerald , ah ? Remember , the matter is still under investigation . ”
32781	32784	32785	32785	I	140	“ Sure . ”
32819	32853	32811	32811	I	140	“ The tests came back , Mrs. Martinez , and I thought we could go through them together and talk about what they mean for you and what I recommend you do next . ”
32928	32940	32923	32923	My	140	“ Well . Okay . Let ’s see , shall we ? ”
32961	32982	32954	32954	I	140	“ What do we have here ? It says here that … oh , excuse me . Just one moment . ”
33098	33115	33089	33089	we	1096	“ Quick , there was an explosion in one of our refineries , Da ’s fault . ”
33166	33177	33162	33162	Hunter	615	“ I have to take this . I ’m sorry . ”
33214	33227	33206	33206	Hunter	615	“ Ash . You have to come home . It ’s Da . ”
33228	33237	33238	33238	I	140	“ Is he okay ? Is he hurt ? ”
33273	33328	33329	33329	He	1102	“ Physically ? He is fine . For now , anyway . There ’s no way of knowing what Mom is gon na do to his ass in the next few hours . Listen , Ash , there ’s a scandal . Someone leaked some photos and text messages of Da with … uh … ”
33367	33407	33408	33408	I	140	“ Just spit it out , Hunt . I know Mom and Dad are n’t giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money . I ’ve lived under their roof my whole life , for goodness ’ sake . ”
33424	33430	33408	33408	I	140	“ What ’d he do ? ”
33431	33438	33439	33439	he	1102	“ It ’s a sex scandal , ”
33443	33483	33439	33439	he	1102	“ Not shocking , I know , but this time there are some pretty graphic pictures on the internet . Da called me as soon as they surfaced . Devon is working to take them down as we speak . ”
33549	33552	33540	33540	he	1102	“ Wow . ”
33601	33607	33590	33590	Merde	147	“ That ’s … ironic , ”
33614	33618	33619	33619	Hunter	615	“ Ya think ? ”
33769	33778	33746	33746	He	615	“ Where are you ? How is Mother ? ”
33810	33842	33843	33843	Hunter	615	“ I ’m just getting into Avebury Court right now . Sail and the kids are with me . Cillian , Persy , and Sam are already there . Mom is … ”
33850	33884	33843	33843	Hunter	615	“ I do n’t know how she is , Ash . She has n’t picked up the phone . Hurry . You ’re the only one who could ever get through to her . ”
33898	33905	33843	33843	Hunter	615	“ All right , love you . ”
33906	33914	33918	33918	he	615	“ Love you , too , sis . ”
34738	34767	34770	34771	his soldiers	1157	“ Sorry , love , but Boss is on more important business than a casual fuck . Guess your two minutes of being Brennan ’s mistress are up , ”
34893	34904	34905	34905	Mother	2875	“ No one asked you to be faithful , Gerald ! ”
34916	34968	34905	34905	Mother	2875	“ That would be too much for you , would n’t it , dear ? But why could n’t you be discreet about it ? How much do you think I can tolerate ? I am a walking , talking joke ! Look at these pictures . Just look at them ! ”
35046	35075	35076	35076	Mother	2875	“ To make matters worse , she is twenty - five ! Younger than your own daughter . What were you thinking ? Aisling , there you are ! ”
35096	35126	35085	35085	she	2875	“ Be a darling and ask someone to give me my special tea with honey and ginger and see to it that my hot bath will be ready soon . ”
35176	35182	35162	35162	they	228	“ Of course , Mother . ”
35261	35273	35274	35274	Cillian	128	“ Enough . Who do you think could ’ve leaked this ? ”
35277	35327	35274	35274	Cillian	128	“ It ’s not the woman in the pictures . She is married now , with a child on the way , and is horrified by this coming out . Hunter spoke to her earlier . She claims someone hacked into her old phone and stole the images illegally . ”
35328	35344	35345	35345	Hunter	615	“ And by her hiccups and hysterical crying , she said the truth , too , ”
35354	35380	35345	35345	Hunter	615	“ I ’ll bet ! I never would ’ve given her the time of the day otherwise ! I ’ve been careful . I swear . ”
35395	35414	35381	35381	Athair	156	“ This is a setup . You know I ’d never do you wrong , Jane my dear . ”
35503	35507	35508	35508	Cillian	128	“ Shut up , ”
35518	35527	35508	35508	Cillian	128	“ Any idea who could have done this ? ”
35528	35557	35558	35558	Hunter	615	“ If we start counting our enemies , we wo n’t leave here until next year , and we have a vacation booked in the Maldives next summer . ”
35568	35576	35558	35558	Hunter	615	“ I ’ll take care of this . ”
35597	35617	35587	35587	He	560	“ Come on , Gerry . Let ’s get to the bottom of this mess . Privacy , please . ”
35635	35641	35642	35642	Everyone	228	“ Jane , you too . ”
35673	35688	35689	35689	She	2875	“ It ’s not fair ! I want to know what they are saying . ”
35712	35747	35706	35707	the servants	1182	“ Oh , Aisling , be a darling and go eavesdrop on them . You know I ’m no good at not being seen . You can slip in undetected , I am sure . ”
35748	35751	35752	35752	I	140	“ Mother , ”
35764	35772	35752	35752	I	140	“ Brennan wanted them to have privacy . ”
35773	35788	35789	35789	She	2875	“ Brennan is a brute and a beast . Who cares what he wants ? ”
35908	35939	35897	35897	I	140	“ Let ’s take it a step back . Tell me about your former lovers , any potential bastard children who might be lurking around looking for a nice check . ”
35954	35985	35940	35940	Sam	560	“ Jesus Christ , Brennan , talk about a loaded question . Well , in the last decade , I had Bonnie , Sheila , Christie , Ulrika , Ruthie — ”
35986	36001	36002	36002	Sam	560	“ Start with the first year of your marriage and move your way up , ”
36008	36015	36002	36002	Sam	560	“ We need to be thorough . ”
36016	36022	36023	36024	my father	2904	“ That could take days ! ”
36120	36123	36124	36124	Sam	560	“ Days , ”
36155	36258	36144	36144	he	560	“ Fucking charming . Let ’s try to narrow it down . Think of someone with the potential to seek revenge . Anyone you knocked up ? Someone you might have hurt personally ? Those would be the people most likely to dig through the dirt and harm you . No one wants to come out as the mistress , but people will have no qualms compromising someone else to take you down . It ’s possible one of your other mistresses hacked into your latest one ’s cloud to shed light as to what she considers foul play on your end . ”
36259	36267	36268	36268	Da	148	“ I do n’t do foul play , ”
36283	36301	36268	36268	Da	148	“ I take care of my mistresses and provide them with money and jewelry and expensive cars . ”
36340	36386	36387	36387	Sam	560	“ I ’m sure you make them feel like fucking rock stars , Gerry . But accidents happen , and you ’re a virile man . Any chance you have any bastards lying around ? Maybe women who had to get hush - hush abortions ? ”
36412	36441	36442	36442	I	140	“ No . No bastard children . And I ’m not that virile . As you are well aware , not all of my children are biologically mine . ”
36498	36511	36512	36512	Sam	560	“ You ’re not really giving me much to work with here , ”
36594	36645	36590	36590	Troy	952	“ Make me a fucking list , Gerry . Of every single woman you stuck your dick into . If I ca n’t be thorough , I ca n’t be helpful . No use in paying me a small fortune for sitting around and babysitting your two fully grown sons . ”
36646	36659	36660	36661	my father	2904	“ I ’m also paying you to keep away from my daughter , ”
36676	36679	36680	36680	Sam	560	“ Yeah . ”
36683	36693	36694	36694	He	560	“ Some challenge that is . Make the list . ”
36756	36759	36751	36751	Sam	560	“ Ow . ”
36842	36857	36858	36858	His	560	“ If it is n’t my favorite tight hole . Been eavesdropping , Nix ? ”
36965	36993	36936	36936	she	1206	“ It ’s my house , Brennan . I can do whatever I want , including , but not limited to , spending time in my sunroom . ”
36994	37041	36936	36936	she	1206	“ You are many things , Aisling , including the daughter of two of the most pathetic creatures I ’ve ever encountered and a champagne socialist , but you are no idiot . So do n’t act like one . What were you doing in there ? ”
37089	37094	37095	37095	I	140	“ Admiring the plants . ”
37099	37102	37095	37095	I	140	“ Bullshit . ”
37103	37107	37108	37108	He	1210	“ Prove it . ”
37120	37135	37116	37116	he	1210	“ Well , then . Nice talk , Brennan . Are you done now ? ”
37153	37157	37158	37158	he	1210	“ Not quite , ”
37186	37203	37170	37171	my mother	2875	“ I ’m glad I caught you here . I have an update about our situation . ”
37204	37208	37209	37209	I	140	“ Our situation ? ”
37214	37219	37220	37220	he	1210	“ Our fucking arrangement , ”
37234	37277	37220	37220	he	1210	“ It ’s canceled . I ’m not interested anymore . You were a great sport . Five out of five stars . Would highly recommend . Unfortunately , I have some pressing issues right now and no time for complicated pussy . ”
37399	37445	37385	37385	I	140	“ We had plans together ? Sorry , I do n’t recall . Either way , thanks for giving me an update about a date I had no plan attending . Now , do n’t you have to go do some work for my father ? ”
37475	37480	37459	37459	he	1210	“ Chop chop now ! ”
37492	37538	37481	37481	I	140	“ As you pointed out earlier , my father pays you a small fortune , and not for your intellectual skills — which , by the way , I find lacking . Let us know when you have more information for us about the leaker . ”
37660	37684	37685	37685	Mother	2875	“ Oh , Aisling , I wo n’t be able to sleep at all tonight . Mind stroking my hair until I do ? ”
37721	37727	37707	37707	I	140	“ Yes . Of course . ”
38560	38566	38567	38567	I	140	“ How bad is it ? ”
38576	38579	38580	38580	Becker	237	“ Bad , ”
38603	38611	38580	38580	Becker	237	“ I think they got my lungs . ”
38612	38620	38621	38621	Angus	238	“ Pretty sure I broke my arm , ”
38763	38767	38768	38768	I	140	“ Get up . ”
38800	38820	38821	38821	I	140	“ I ai n’t carrying your ass to the car honeymoon - style . You too , Fucker Junior , ”
38927	38931	38932	38932	He	241	“ ’ Ello ? ”
38936	38944	38932	38932	He	241	“ Enjoying an afternoon nap , fucker ? ”
38962	38977	38932	38932	He	241	“ Make yourself a cup of coffee . I have a job for you . ”
38978	38981	38982	38982	He	241	“ Sam ? ”
38991	39022	38982	38982	He	241	“ Oh , Sam , I ’m sorry . I thought your secretary left you the message . I ’m not home . I ’m in Greece until next week . ”
39124	39138	39139	39139	I	140	“ What the fuck makes you think I talk to my assistants regularly ? ”
39143	39194	39139	39139	I	140	“ Next time , have the stones to tell me directly when you take an unauthorized vacation . Now give me your cousin ’s address . I ’ve got two injured soldiers I would very much like to keep alive because they owe me three weeks ’ pay of work . ”
39265	39280	39257	39258	A nurse	1269	“ Raul ’s out of town , Sam . Visiting his son in college , ”
39286	39299	39300	39300	I	140	“ Is anyone in your family familiar with the concept of work ? ”
39303	39313	39300	39300	I	140	“ Yeah , I know , it ’s unfortunate . ”
39314	39330	39331	39331	I	140	“ The state of your face after I ’m done with you will be unfortunate , ”
39334	39352	39331	39331	I	140	“ What the hell were you thinking , skipping town without having a medical backup for me ? ”
39353	39365	39366	39366	he	241	“ It was poor planning on my behalf . I agree , ”
39386	39403	39404	39405	Dr. Holmberg	241	“ Surely you know someone who works in the medical field who can help you out ? ”
39526	39565	39518	39518	they	712	“ You ’d be surprised , Holmberg , but I do n’t know many doctors . Or fucking astronauts , for that matter . My line of work is killing people , not nursing them back to health . ”
39886	39891	39892	39893	Dr. Holmberg	241	“ Perhaps you could — ”
39929	39942	39923	39924	The wallflower	1291	“ Does that mean you are finally going to ask her out ? ”
40007	40013	39988	39988	Angus	238	“ Are you fucking high ? ”
40025	40031	40032	40033	A child	1004	“ She ’s a child . ”
40142	40166	40167	40167	Sailor	106	“ High ? Oh , I wish . I ca n’t do shit while breastfeeding . Not even drink a glass of wine . ”
40194	40210	40211	40211	I	140	“ If you want sympathy , I suggest you talk to someone with a heart , ”
40214	40229	40211	40211	I	140	“ Oh , really ? So what ’s the thing beating in your chest ? ”
40230	40244	40245	40245	She	463	“ It ’s not beating . It ’s ticking . Probably a bomb . ”
40249	40271	40245	40245	She	463	“ Do n’t be too harsh with Ash . You know she is a gentle one . Love you , asshole . ”
40272	40277	40278	40278	I	140	“ Bye , shitface . ”
40326	40329	40330	40330	Her	463	“ Hello ? ”
40346	40351	40352	40352	I	140	“ It ’s Sam , ”
40357	40360	40352	40352	I	140	“ Oh , ”
40402	40412	40413	40413	I	140	“ How can I help you , Mr. Brennan ? ”
40434	40477	40427	40427	I	140	“ I have two injured soldiers . I ca n’t drop them at the hospital for obvious reasons . If I bring them over to Badlands , could you get a triage kit and treat them ? You ’ll be paid handsomely . ”
40530	40536	40537	40537	she	1313	“ What are their injuries ? ”
40544	40570	40537	40537	she	1313	“ Give me the physical description , please , not your medical assessment , unless of course you went to med school without my knowledge . ”
40618	40633	40603	40603	her	1313	“ One has a broken arm . The other was shot in the chest . ”
40634	40641	40603	40603	her	1313	“ Where about in the chest ? ”
40642	40652	40653	40653	She	1313	“ Lungs . Meet me at Badlands in thirty . ”
40791	40794	40795	40795	she	463	“ No , ”
40799	40812	40813	40813	She	463	“ We ’ll do things my way . Hold on a sec . ”
40884	40922	40923	40923	I	140	“ You wo n’t have the equipment I need . I ’ll text you an address in a few minutes . Come alone — just you and your soldiers — and make sure no one sees you . ”
40935	40940	40942	40942	she	140	“ what the fuck ? ”
41270	41277	41278	41278	She	249	“ What do we have here ? ”
41366	41404	41354	41354	She	249	“ I ’m going to start with this one , since he needs urgent medical attention . Make yourself useful for a change and help me set him up on the table , will you , Sam ? ”
41554	41562	41563	41563	I	140	“ What the hell is this place ? ”
41593	41616	41617	41617	she	1337	“ A friend of mine owns it . He treats people without insurance here . People who can not afford urgent care , ”
41641	41664	41638	41638	I	140	“ Are you helping him do this ? It ’s fucking illegal , Aisling . I ca n’t let you do this . ”
41673	41727	41638	41638	I	140	“ I ’ve seen you shoot someone in the head and you are here so I can patch up your hitmen . Oh , the hypocrisy . Dare I say , Sam , this is so deliciously rich I think your statement alone should be in a higher tax bracket than my family . ”
41728	41737	41667	41667	her	1337	“ You and I are not the same . ”
41738	41743	41744	41744	She	1337	“ According to you … ”
41747	41754	41744	41744	She	1337	“ You ’re nothing to me . ”
41755	41795	41638	41638	I	140	“ I am your father ’s right - hand man . My job is to keep his kids out of trouble . I will do whatever the fuck I need to to stop you from getting thrown in jail . ”
41796	41822	41823	41823	She	1337	“ You will keep well away from me , Brennan , and let me do my job , or I will never help you again . ”
41894	41901	41902	41902	she	1337	“ Can I see your ticket ? ”
41910	41918	41919	41919	I	140	“ What the fuck do you mean ? ”
41922	41941	41919	41919	I	140	“ To the show you are apparently watching . Get out , Sam . I ’m working here . ”
41984	42002	41976	41976	his	238	“ I think I ’ll stay and see you in action , if you do n’t mind . ”
42003	42008	41976	41976	his	238	“ I do mind . ”
42009	42029	41976	41976	his	238	“ Allow me to correct my statement — I do n’t care if you mind . I ’m staying . ”
42030	42037	42038	42038	she	1337	“ I wo n’t treat him , ”
42056	42073	42038	42038	she	1337	“ Yes , you will . Your need to be helpful overpowers your hatred toward me . ”
42074	42081	42082	42082	she	1337	“ Do n’t be so sure , ”
42103	42110	42082	42082	she	1337	“ Your Hippocratic Oath , then . ”
42170	42174	42175	42175	she	1337	“ Any news ? ”
42184	42187	42178	42178	she	1337	“ About ? ”
42188	42198	42199	42199	You	1344	“ My father and the media circus around him . ”
42262	42268	42279	42279	Her	1337	“ Still working on it . ”
42269	42278	42279	42279	Her	1337	“ A bit slow , are n’t you ? ”
42327	42338	42303	42303	She	1337	“ You got a problem , speak to my manager . ”
42339	42346	42347	42347	she	1337	“ You are your own manager , ”
42351	42356	42357	42357	I	140	“ That ’s right … ”
42361	42382	42357	42357	I	140	“ … and I do n’t care what you think about my services , so tough fucking luck , Nix . ”
42383	42387	42388	42388	she	1337	“ So taciturn , ”
42421	42430	42388	42388	she	1337	“ Almost like you have something to hide . ”
42431	42458	42459	42459	I	140	“ Looks to me like you ’re the one with the juicy secrets . Tell me about this friend of yours who is operating this place . ”
42488	42501	42504	42504	I	140	“ I will do no such thing . I respect his privacy . ”
42563	42584	42549	42549	her	463	“ You know I ’ll find out either way . Do yourself a favor and give me the information now , ”
42627	42656	42614	42614	She	463	“ I ’d like to see you try . Now please help me return Dumb to the reception , and fetch me Dumber . Go on , now . ”
42902	42909	42910	42910	I	140	“ What do I owe you ? ”
42923	42941	42910	42910	I	140	“ Nine grand , plus supplies , so let ’s round it to eleven . Cash only . ”
42988	42994	42983	42983	I	140	“ You ’re kidding me . ”
42995	43027	43028	43028	Ash	133	“ Heavens , Brennan . I ’m a highborn woman . I lack anything resembling a good sense of humor . Goes against everything I ’ve been taught in Catholic school , ”
43032	43049	43028	43028	Ash	133	“ Do you think it would be less pricey if you took them to the hospital ? ”
43050	43075	43076	43076	She	1358	“ I think if I took them to the hospital , they would n’t have been treated in some frat boy ’s fucking basement . ”
43123	43171	43172	43174	The little shi	1361	“ They ’re alive and well . Same result as you ’d get at the hospital . I ’m sorry , I assumed you ’d have this kind of money handy . Would you like me to let you know about our payment options , Mr. Brennan ? ”
43214	43223	43196	43196	I	140	“ What are you playing at , Nix ? ”
43224	43227	43228	43228	Her	1358	“ Nothing . ”
43259	43276	43196	43196	I	140	“ You asked for my services . I assumed you were prepared to pay for them . ”
43277	43285	43286	43286	I	140	“ You do n’t need the money . ”
43337	43361	43362	43362	Ash	133	“ Neither do you . So pay up . I ’ll be seeing you at Thanksgiving dinner . You can pay me then . ”
43457	43464	43465	43465	Nix	140	“ Now if you excuse me … ”
43536	43542	43543	43543	I	140	“ How about a kiss ? ”
43667	43678	43679	43679	I	140	“ Would a kiss be a sufficient form of payment ? ”
43882	43889	43890	43890	she	1358	“ You taste like an ashtray , ”
43915	43934	43905	43905	she	1358	“ Maybe so , but you taste like an easy lay , my least favorite flavor of woman . ”
44050	44056	44037	44037	her	1358	“ Now we ’re even . ”
44083	44107	44108	44108	she	1358	“ Oh , you thought a kiss would be your payment as opposed to the eleven grand you owe me ? Oh my … ”
44124	44211	44108	44108	she	1358	“ … my apologies , Mr. Brennan . I do n’t accept sexual favors as payment . That would be my father ’s specialty , and I very much doubt he ’d be interested in what you have to offer . I would still like the money at Thanksgiving . What ’s the common interest your loan sharks use ? Forty - five percent ? That suits me . Now , have a good rest of the day , Mr. Brennan , and do take care . ”
45385	45388	45376	45376	my	140	“ Ash ? ”
45489	45494	45495	45495	I	140	“ Hey , Pers … ”
45516	45522	45511	45511	he	227	“ … how are you ? ”
45523	45559	45560	45560	She	1410	“ I ’m great . You looked thoughtful through the window . Which was why I bypassed the usual hugs and kisses routine to see how you were doing . Your mother looks … preoccupied . ”
45633	45638	45622	45622	I	140	“ Where ’s Cillian ? ”
45655	45673	45674	45674	Persy	225	“ With Gerald in his office . I ca n’t believe he did that to your mom . ”
45710	45714	45693	45693	she	225	“ I can . ”
45730	45740	45715	45715	I	140	“ Sailor told me Sam asked for your number , ”
45914	45919	45920	45920	I	140	“ It was nothing . ”
45946	45958	45931	45931	he	227	“ He just needed some help . Something work - related . ”
45959	45962	45963	45963	Persephone	154	“ Huh . ”
45977	46003	46004	46004	Persephone	154	“ But maybe it ’s a start ? He never contacted you before , and you ’re hardly the only person he could turn to . ”
46042	46051	46037	46037	I	140	“ You ’re grasping at straws , Pers . ”
46052	46065	46066	46066	she	1415	“ Weirder pairings have happened . Look at your brother and me , ”
46074	46085	46066	46066	she	1415	“ You just need more patience as you pursue him . ”
46086	46112	46113	46113	I	140	“ Cillian always had a boner for you . He just hid it like a thirteen - year - old . Sam is not pursuable , ”
46182	46193	46194	46194	Persy	225	“ If your brothers are pursuable , so is Sam , ”
46202	46211	46194	46194	Persy	225	“ You should go for what you want . ”
46212	46227	46228	46228	I	140	“ But what if what I want is everything that ’s bad for me ? ”
46236	46282	46228	46228	I	140	“ What if I ’m stupid to want Sam Brennan ? He is a gangster . A murderer . An underground boss and my father ’s right hand . So many things can go wrong . If they ’ll go in any direction at all … ”
46283	46289	46290	46290	Persy	225	“ You just described love . ”
46293	46335	46290	46290	Persy	225	“ Love is a risk . It ’s a storm that either disrupts your life or clears your path . Sometimes it does both at the same time . Focus on getting the guy . Everything else will fall into place . ”
46544	46555	46556	46556	Devon	167	“ The concept of Thanksgiving is still jarring to me , ”
46602	46610	46611	46611	Devon	167	“ Who exactly are you lot thanking ? ”
46650	46655	46656	46656	Hunter	615	“ Um , God ? ”
46669	46713	46656	46656	Hunter	615	“ You ’re just bitter because we have stuff to be thankful for . Big - box stores , the First Amendment , Jewish deli food , and , of course , Scarlett Johansson . What do you have to be thankful for ? ”
46714	46729	46730	46730	Devon	167	“ Footie , brown sauce , and being generally intellectually superior to the Yanks , ”
46745	46752	46753	46754	My father	2904	“ By footie you mean soccer ? ”
46766	46786	46757	46757	He	2904	“ No , by football I mean football . The one where you kick the ball with your foot … ”
46798	46830	46787	46787	Devon	167	“ … as opposed to holding it in your hand while running , crashing into random people like a barbarian trying to sneak the rival village ’s best - looking maiden . ”
46831	46857	46858	46858	Troy	952	“ Keep trashing football , and the only thing you ’ll be thankful for this Thanksgiving is getting out of this meal in one piece . ”
46871	46901	46858	46858	Troy	952	“ So , Sam , you ’re the last single man standing . Up for a quick trip to Sin City to play blackjack at the casino this weekend ? ”
46907	46914	46902	46902	Devon	167	“ You ’re still doing that ? ”
46929	46947	46915	46915	Sparrow	463	“ It ’s dangerous , not to mention reckless . You ’re already blacklisted from three hotels . ”
46963	46967	46968	46968	Hunter	615	“ Not surprised . ”
46980	46989	46974	46975	Bloody Mary	257	“ Do I want to know what for ? ”
46990	46996	46997	46997	Devon	167	“ Winning too much money . ”
47005	47036	46997	46997	Devon	167	“ Sam is the best blackjack player I ’ve ever seen in my lifetime . A wizard with numbers , really . He makes all the calculations in split seconds . ”
47063	47074	47058	47058	Devon	167	“ What a great way to utilize your analytical talent , ”
47079	47098	47099	47099	Sam	560	“ Better to waste a talent in the wrong place than not have one in the first place , ”
47103	47119	47120	47120	Cillian	128	“ Your main talent is to find your way into rich people ’s inner circle , ”
47127	47138	47120	47120	Cillian	128	“ Which you ’ve been doing very well since childhood . ”
47139	47147	47148	47148	Hunter	615	“ Anyway , cards at Badland tonight , ”
47151	47156	47148	47148	Hunter	615	“ Right after dinner . ”
47226	47235	47236	47236	Mother	2875	“ I ’m so lucky to have Aisling … ”
47246	47282	47236	47236	Mother	2875	“ … I do n’t know what I would have done without her . She is my anchor . No wonder she works at bringing life into this planet . She is my perfect angel . ”
47283	47291	47292	47292	Emmabelle	167	“ She sure is saintly , ma’am . ”
47326	47335	47357	47358	my mother	2875	“ Too good to be true . Almost . ”
47336	47356	47357	47358	my mother	2875	“ Right now , she is working day and night to help me with a charity event this month , ”
47439	47442	47422	47422	I	140	“ Yes ? ”
47468	47494	47495	47495	I	140	“ Yes . Of course . No , it is not a bad time at all . I ’m on my way . Thank you . ”
47601	47616	47586	47586	he	560	“ My apologies , but I have to run . Something important at work . ”
47640	47667	47628	47628	Everyone	449	“ Compliments to our chef . I will send her flowers tomorrow morning for her troubles . Thank you , everyone . Have a good evening . ”
48021	48027	48028	48028	I	140	“ It ’s not fair . ”
48047	48054	48028	48028	I	140	“ Nothing about this is fair . ”
48055	48061	48076	48076	Sam	560	“ Tell me about it , ”
48134	48176	48177	48177	He	2899	“ Fair is where you get cotton candy . It has nothing to do with real life . Now , tell me how you found yourself in Westford as opposed to Brigham Hospital , where your ass should have been tonight . ”
48284	48313	48267	48267	I	140	“ Should n’t you be playing cards with my brothers at Badlands right about now ? Or are you missing Cook ’s famous apple pie to be here ? ”
48314	48324	48325	48325	he	2899	“ Should n’t you be answering my fucking question ? ”
48328	48337	48338	48338	I	140	“ The answer is none of your business , ”
48343	48349	48350	48350	He	2899	“ This old tune again . ”
48361	48429	48356	48356	he	2899	“ You are my business . My boss ’ daughter . I should have kept tabs on you and tailed your ass earlier , but I did n’t . So here we are . Now let ’s cut the bullshit , shall we ? I checked everywhere worth checking and cross - examined my sources . You are not a resident at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital . ”
48450	48458	48459	48459	I	140	“ Been checking on me , Brennan ? ”
48472	48489	48459	48459	I	140	“ I ’m flattered , but not surprised . Still , that does n’t mean anything . ”
48490	48561	48562	48562	he	140	“ Sure it does . For starters , it means you are a fucking liar . My least favorite trait in people . But then I thought to myself , maybe the lie is n’t so big . Maybe it ’s about prestige . Little , perfect Aisling did n’t want her parents to know she did n’t get accepted to one of the most respected hospitals in the country … ”
48586	48609	48610	48610	I	140	“ … so I went and checked with all of the hospitals in Boston , every single fucking one . Guess what ? ”
48620	48659	48660	48660	he	140	“ You ’re not registered anywhere as a doctor . You turned all of them down . Every single fucking offer . At this point , I got suspicious . Did you even finish med school at all ? ”
48683	48716	48717	48717	He	140	“ So I sniffed around that angle , too . You did , in fact , graduate from Harvard Medical School . So it ’s not that you are n’t a doctor . ”
48748	48771	48772	48772	His	140	“ Whatever you do , you ’re doing it under the radar . What the fuck are you playing at , Nix ? ”
48817	48824	48810	48810	I	140	“ You really want to know ? ”
48900	48909	48910	48910	I	140	“ None . Of . Your . Business , ”
48953	48985	48944	48944	I	140	“ Do n’t play games with me , Aisling . I will win . Easily . And I ’m a bad sport and notoriously unfair , just like your miserable life . ”
49015	49023	49009	49009	I	140	“ Do you want to be humiliated ? ”
49033	49053	49024	49024	He	140	“ No . I want you to make up your mind about what you want to do with me , ”
49058	49081	49082	49082	He	140	“ You ’ve been running after me with your skirt up , begging to be fucked since before you got your period . ”
49143	49150	49119	49119	He	140	“ You … you … you … ”
49187	49272	49177	49177	I	140	“ Tore your pretty designer dress ? Do n’t worry . Daddy’ll buy you a hundred more . The pathetic part is you ’re not going to deny me because you and I both know I can fuck you whenever I want , however I want , however many times I want . Bend you over — the jewel of the Fitzpatrick crown , Princess Aisling of Avebury Court Manor — and ram my cock so deep inside your ass you ’ll see stars . ”
49380	49391	49363	49363	he	1466	“ What do you do for a living , Nix ? ”
49392	49398	49399	49399	I	140	“ Fuck y - you , ”
49414	49438	49439	49439	He	1466	“ I would n’t call that a full - time job . I usually grow bored of my fucks after a few hookups . ”
49521	49527	49528	49528	he	1466	“ Illegal , experimental drugs ? ”
49595	49617	49618	49618	He	1466	“ The no insurance , doctors - without - borders bullshit where you treat the poor ai n’t flying , sweetheart . ”
49653	49735	49736	49736	I	140	“ Whoever lives in that building does n’t get monthly food stamps . Take it from someone who looked poverty in the eye . I ’d hate to blow your cover and kick in every door at the complex to find the asshole you visited and milk your secret out of them . But I ’ll do it if I have to . So for the last time , Aisling , tell me what the fuck it is that you do . ”
49858	49863	49864	49864	I	140	“ I was close , ”
49867	49880	49864	49864	I	140	“ Tough fucking luck . For more information , go to www.lifeain’tfairandwe’vebeenthroughthis.com . ”
49881	49886	49887	49887	I	140	“ What the hell ! ”
49895	49966	49967	49967	His	560	“ The hell is you are a fucking headache and need to be taught a lesson . I am going to get the truth out of you , Aisling , one way or the other , but until I do , you lose all cumming privileges . Not by my hands , anyway , and let ’s admit it — your sole purpose in life is getting fucked by me . ”
50042	50052	50053	50053	I	140	“ Why do you even care what I do ? ”
50073	50097	50115	50115	he	560	“ You made it perfectly clear you do n’t give a damn about me . You spent a whole decade dodging my advances . ”
50180	50184	50185	50185	he	560	“ Circumstances change , ”
50188	50194	50195	50195	I	140	“ Yes , they do , ”
50198	50249	50250	50250	He	560	“ Which is why I suggest you stop assuming I am always going to be at your disposal . I ’m not the same girl you met at the carnival , Sam . I ’m all grown up , and I wo n’t be treated like I ’m a toy . ”
50258	50262	50250	50250	He	560	“ Wanna bet ? ”
50263	50280	50281	50281	I	140	“ How are we going to settle the bet ? In your card room at Badlands ? ”
50307	50317	50318	50318	he	560	“ No . You ’re not allowed in Badlands , ”
50326	50333	50334	50334	I	140	“ But Sailor and Persy are . ”
50338	50365	50334	50334	I	140	“ Sailor and Persy are not running around looking for trouble . They stay at home with their babies . I suggest you do the same . ”
50366	50373	50374	50374	I	140	“ I do n’t have babies , ”
50380	50391	50374	50374	I	140	“ Oh , and it ’s not the nineteenth century . ”
50392	50413	50334	50334	I	140	“ You might be annoying , but I ’m sure you ’ll find a schmuck willing to knock you up . ”
50414	50440	50334	50334	I	140	“ What about Belle ? How come she ’s allowed in Badlands ? She looks for trouble all the time . Much more than me . ”
50441	50474	50374	50374	I	140	“ Belle is damaged goods and also none of my fucking business . If you end up catching the clap in Badlands ’ restroom , your family will come crying to me . ”
50475	50482	50334	50334	I	140	“ You ’re a sexist pig . ”
50483	50503	50504	50504	I	140	“ And you are still interested . What does it say about you , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Jr. ? ”
50544	50570	50571	50571	He	560	“ Hold onto those little secrets of yours , Nix . Because I ’m going to have one hell of a good time unraveling them . ”
50779	50786	50787	50787	I	140	“ Where are you taking him ? ”
50812	50816	50799	50799	I	140	“ Disney World , ”
50824	50833	50817	50819	my older brother	587	“ Where do you think ? The hospital . ”
50834	50838	50839	50839	I	140	“ The hospital ! ”
50847	50857	50839	50839	I	140	“ Why ? What happened ? Where ’s Mother ? ”
50858	50883	50884	50884	Hunter	615	“ Mother is hiding in her room crying about how Da stole the show , being a real fucking adult about it per usual , ”
50904	50938	50939	50939	Cillian	128	“ As for Athair , he ’s been vomiting nonstop since you left , has diarrhea , a dry mouth , a rash , trouble breathing , and he fainted twice since dessert . ”
50948	50957	50939	50939	Cillian	128	“ How would you diagnose that , Doc ? ”
50958	50982	50939	50939	Cillian	128	“ Well , I need to run more tests , of course , but at first glance I would say he was poisoned . ”
50983	50990	50991	50991	Hunter	615	“ Ding , ding , ding , ”
50995	51019	50991	50991	Hunter	615	“ When Da finished his cup of coffee , he proceeded to collapse on top of the table like a stack of cards . ”
51029	51036	50991	50991	Hunter	615	“ I ’m coming with you . ”
51037	51046	51047	51047	Hunter	615	“ You just got back from the hospital , ”
51114	51120	51100	51112	Every single member of my family and the small circle of my friends	1484	“ It ’s no trouble . ”
51121	51125	51126	51126	Cillian	128	“ Your funeral , ”
51129	51161	51126	51126	Cillian	128	“ Hunter , let her take the passenger seat . C’m on , Ash . We ’re taking the car . We do n’t want the headlines an ambulance would create . ”
51162	51167	51168	51168	Hunter	615	“ Forever the Fitzpatricks . ”
51192	51202	51182	51182	I	140	“ Sure you ’re okay leaving your baby behind ? ”
51221	51226	51216	51216	He	220	“ Do n’t start . ”
51227	51231	51232	51232	Hunter	615	“ No shade . ”
51241	51280	51232	51232	Hunter	615	“ All I ’m saying is she is probably writing all of us out of her will because we are driving Da to the hospital instead of telling her how pretty she is — after she poisoned him . ”
51497	51503	51491	51495	No one other than Mother	1498	“ It ’s not Mother . ”
51540	51545	51491	51495	No one other than Mother	1498	“ It ’s not . ”
51546	51582	51583	51583	Hunter	615	“ Oh , come on , Ash . At the very least , it ’s an option worth considering . They ’ve been at each other ’s throats for as long as I can remember . ”
51630	51643	51621	51621	I	140	“ No , Hunt . She is incapable of hurting a fly . ”
51732	51757	51758	51758	Cillian	128	“ She is also the only person at the table with a hard - on to see Gerald return his equipment to the Almighty , ”
51880	51887	51888	51888	I	140	“ Let ’s make a list ! ”
51907	51923	51888	51888	I	140	“ Of who was there . Then we can go through it and dig deeper . ”
51924	51930	51931	51931	Hunter	615	“ All right , Sherlock . ”
51944	51966	51931	51931	Hunter	615	“ Let ’s see , there was Xander , Rooney , and Astor , all of them under three years old … ”
51967	51985	51986	51986	Cillian	128	“ Astor ’s been teething . He can be a mean little thing when he is teething , ”
52002	52033	52034	52034	Hunter	615	“ Rooney has a mean streak , too . But she usually pees on the carpet when she seeks her revenge upon us . Then there was Sailor and me , ”
52037	52058	52034	52034	Hunter	615	“ Neither of us have beef with Da . And you , Ash , do n’t have a motive either . ”
52059	52091	52092	52092	Cillian	128	“ Persephone and I are out of the question . My wife could n’t hurt a fly if she tried , and I already have everything I ever needed from Gerald , ”
52095	52125	52092	52092	Cillian	128	“ And then there ’s Emmabelle . A distasteful excuse for a human being , sure , but I would n’t go as far as calling her a murderer . ”
52126	52143	52144	52144	I	140	“ Whoever did this did n’t try to kill him . They tried to spook him , ”
52148	52167	52144	52144	I	140	“ But I agree , Emmabelle has no connection to Da whatsoever . What about Troy ? Sparrow ? ”
52168	52193	52194	52194	Hunter	615	“ As far as I ’m aware , Troy and Sparrow have no business with Athair . No reason to want to threaten him . ”
52199	52202	52203	52203	I	140	“ Devon ? ”
52222	52226	52207	52207	Cillian	128	“ No motive . ”
52227	52236	52243	52243	Cillian	128	“ True , but he is not family . ”
52237	52242	52243	52243	Cillian	128	“ Neither is Sam . ”
52249	52262	52263	52263	I	140	“ I think we should keep an eye on him , too , ”
52285	52313	52281	52281	Hunter	615	“ Whoa , whoa , whoa , keep an eye how … ? We were joking , but … he ’s my brother - in - law . ”
52314	52327	52328	52328	Cillian	128	“ He is also the most corrupt man to walk this earth . ”
52337	52354	52328	52328	Cillian	128	“ I ’ll deal with him . Sniff around . See what he is up to . ”
52355	52358	52359	52359	I	140	“ No … ”
52366	52379	52359	52359	I	140	“ … I ’ll do it . He wo n’t suspect me . ”
52380	52385	52386	52386	Hunter	615	“ I suspect you . ”
52393	52425	52386	52386	Hunter	615	“ No offense , sis , but even Rooney knows Auntie Ash is in lurveeee with Uncle Sam . And I do n’t mean you being patriotic toward the US of A. ”
52426	52438	52439	52439	I	140	“ But see , that ’s what makes it so perfect , ”
52443	52459	52439	52439	I	140	“ He will never see me as a threat or think I could harm him . ”
52460	52470	52471	52471	Cillian	128	“ I do n’t want him anywhere near you , ”
52474	52496	52471	52471	Cillian	128	“ Well , tough luck , big bro . I ’m twenty - seven . You ca n’t shelter me forever . ”
52497	52501	52502	52502	Hunter	615	“ Wanna bet ? ”
52527	52551	52552	52552	Cillian	128	“ Fine . Ash , you can sniff around Sam . Just remember it is frowned upon to have sex with your target , ”
52555	52563	52552	52552	Cillian	128	“ I ’ll check the Devon angle . ”
52564	52574	52575	52575	Hunter	615	“ And I ’ll pray for both your souls . ”
52587	52688	52575	52575	Hunter	615	“ Because both of y’ all are dumbasses who watch too much CSI . It ’s Jane . She wanted to get back at Da for sticking his dick in the wrong hole and things got a little bit out of hand . Not the first time she did something drastic and threw a fit . Remember when he gifted her the butterfly garden after she found out he ’d been screwing her own sister ? Not that I ever liked this particular auntie , but she threw his Rolex collection into the food processor and set it to high . ”
52732	52779	52780	52780	Cillian	128	“ Thanks for the little trip down memory lane to remind me I am the spawn of two of the most disgusting people to ever grace the planet . Now , if that is all , I ’d like to go back to running my company . ”
52798	52838	52795	52795	I	140	“ May the best man win , Aisling . You think it ’s Sam , Hunter thinks it ’s Mother , and I think Gerald has been spending too much time at the medicine cabinet and had an oopsie . ”
52996	53007	52978	52978	He	754	“ The hostile takeover for FMK Petroleum is well underway . ”
53019	53029	53010	53010	Gerald	754	“ We just need to finalize the small print . ”
53134	53143	53144	53144	Gerald	754	“ Samuel , are you ready to go ? ”
53151	53193	53147	53147	I	140	“ Their CEO wo n’t say no to the deal . I dug up too much dirt on him . By the time I ’m done , he ’ll be happy to sell you his shares for a fucking Costco membership . ”
53194	53200	53201	53201	Gerald	754	“ That ’s my boy . ”
53222	53225	53219	53219	he	1535	“ my boy ”
53233	53247	53248	53248	Devon	167	“ In terms of the paperwork , we ’ve done our due diligence , ”
53258	53274	53248	53248	Devon	167	“ All that ’s left is to hope the CEO has pull with the shareholders . ”
53499	53504	53505	53505	Gerald	754	“ Oh , Sam … ”
53516	53536	53505	53505	Gerald	754	“ That ’s the point where I ’m supposed to ask how you ’re doing , right , Gerry ? ”
53547	53551	53552	53552	His	754	“ It is . ”
53556	53576	53552	53552	His	754	“ And the answer is terrible . I am beside myself . I moved out of my marital bedroom . ”
53577	53584	53585	53585	I	140	“ Ah , the old doghouse , ”
53600	53650	53585	53585	I	140	“ The doghouse is better than sharing a bed with a bitch . I do n’t want to be anywhere near her . She goddamn nearly killed me , Sam . And the worst part is she is still denying it . Trying to poison me . Damn woman . ”
53690	53698	53699	53699	I	140	“ Have you made the list yet ? ”
53702	53722	53723	53723	I	140	“ The faster we get to the bottom of this , the quicker we can move on from this . ”
53756	53772	53773	53773	I	140	“ Jealousy and desperation for money are key aspects in trying to mess with someone , ”
53776	53780	53781	53781	Gerald	754	“ I did . ”
53786	53858	53781	53781	Gerald	754	“ Three nights it took me . Doing this made me realize something , you know , son ? It made me see that I ’ve been spending most of my time with women but none of it with the woman I was married to . Such a sad state of affairs . Ironically , I wo n’t be giving Jane more attention now , after what she put me through . ”
53859	53865	53866	53866	I	140	“ Hand me the list . ”
53958	53980	53937	53937	He	754	“ There ’ll be some names you might recognize on the list . I trust everything in this room is confidential . ”
53981	53984	53985	53985	I	140	“ Sure , ”
54266	54273	54256	54256	I	140	“ I ’ll have a look . ”
54274	54283	54284	54284	He	671	“ Let me know if something pops up . ”
54300	54338	54284	54284	He	671	“ I just want this nightmare to be over . I put extra cameras around the house to make sure I am protected . I want to believe it is not Jane , but with our history … ”
54449	54451	54445	54445	she	97	“ parent ”
54711	54726	54705	54705	I	140	“ I put extra cameras around the house to make sure I am protected . ”
54820	54838	54839	54839	I	140	“ Nice scrubs . Shame you only put them on so your family buys your hospital story . ”
54965	54974	54951	54951	I	140	“ Have a nice evening , Miss Fitzpatrick . ”
54983	54990	54975	54975	I	140	“ Burn in Hell , Brennan . ”
54991	55006	55007	55007	I	140	“ If there ’s a God , that ’s definitely His plan for me . ”
55016	55043	55007	55007	I	140	“ Oh , there is a God , and trust me , when He gets His hands on you , I ’ll be waiting with popcorn . ”
55044	55053	55054	55054	Rooney	211	“ Uncle Tham ! Can I ride you ? ”
55148	55154	55155	55155	Rooney	211	“ I wanna ride you . ”
55174	55179	55155	55155	Rooney	211	“ Puh - lease . ”
55180	55187	55188	55188	I	140	“ After dinner , Roon Loon , ”
55237	55250	55251	55251	Rooney	211	“ Auntie Emmabelle says all the girls at your club ride you , ”
55264	55274	55251	55251	Rooney	211	“ Auntie Emmabelle should have her mouth stitched shut . ”
55282	55295	55296	55296	Rooney	211	“ I thought I was the only girl who can ride you . ”
55361	55396	55397	55397	Sparrow	463	“ Samuel , could you please hold either the baby or the beer ? It does n’t look good when you have both in your arms . Put one down and help me serve . ”
55425	55430	55431	55431	I	140	“ Yes , ma’am , ”
55451	55456	55448	55448	Sailor	106	“ A - hole , ”
55461	55466	55448	55448	Sailor	106	“ I heard that . ”
55467	55473	55474	55474	She	463	“ You were meant to ! ”
55528	55536	55537	55537	Sparrow	463	“ There ’s something different about you , ”
55548	55552	55553	55553	I	140	“ Different how ? ”
55561	55566	55567	55567	She	463	“ Different … pensive . ”
55577	55584	55585	55585	I	140	“ Put this on the table . ”
55628	55645	55614	55614	I	140	“ I ’m the same usual shade of fucked - up as I ’ve always been , ”
55876	55886	55865	55865	she	463	“ Are you sure it ’s not about Cat ? ”
55887	55910	55865	55865	she	463	“ Positive . And by the way , buying her a tombstone ? Dumb move . Grow a fucking spine , Spar . ”
55911	55945	55946	55946	She	463	“ I have a spine . I also have a son who is so deeply in denial about his feelings , he ca n’t see straight . Have you ever heard of Selichot ? ”
55962	55965	55966	55966	I	140	“ No . ”
55976	56083	55966	55966	I	140	“ Every year , practicing Jews recite penitential poems and prayers leading to the High Holidays . The thirteen attributes of mercy are a central theme throughout these prayers . Instead of going to a Catholic confession , the Jews go to the people they have wronged individually and ask for their forgiveness . It ’s soul cleansing , they say . I have a feeling one day you ’ll wake up and realize you need to atone — to receive forgiveness — for your sins . I think this day is fast approaching , and having a tombstone to go visit will serve you well . ”
56084	56091	56092	56092	I	140	“ Ask for forgiveness from Cat ? ”
56103	56138	56092	56092	I	140	“ Forgiveness for what ? Being the fastest sperm who was unfortunate enough to bump into her egg … or expecting her to perform her motherly duties for the half second she raised me ? ”
56139	56144	56145	56145	Sparrow	463	“ For hating her , ”
56156	56165	56145	56145	Sparrow	463	“ A son can not hate his mother . ”
56166	56192	56092	56092	I	140	“ This one can and does . Actually , it ’s not even hate . I ’m indifferent , which is so much more humiliating . ”
56193	56202	56203	56203	She	463	“ Neutral men are the Devil ’s allies . ”
56219	56228	56229	56229	I	140	“ The Devil and I get along fine . ”
56243	56247	56229	56229	I	140	“ Anything else ? ”
56248	56256	56257	56257	she	463	“ What are you not indifferent about ? ”
56260	56268	56229	56229	I	140	“ Nothing . Nothing matters to me . ”
56269	56275	56276	56276	she	463	“ Bull , meet shit , ”
56279	56285	56229	56229	I	140	“ Something is bothering you . ”
56286	56294	56229	56229	I	140	“ It ’s none of your concern . ”
56295	56319	56320	56320	Sparrow	463	“ And it ’s not yours either , right ? Big Sam Brennan does n’t care about things . He is above emotions , ”
56421	56424	56425	56425	Sailor	106	“ Mom ! ”
56432	56441	56442	56442	Sparrow	463	“ Hurry up , Roon Loon is starving . ”
56590	56598	56579	56579	you	1610	“ Remember our conversation the night of ? ”
56599	56603	56604	56604	I	140	“ Night of ? ”
56608	56618	56604	56604	I	140	“ The night you moved in with us permanently . ”
56629	56634	56621	56621	Cat	97	“ What about it ? ”
56644	56662	56635	56635	I	140	“ I told you one day a woman was going to change your mind about all women . ”
56674	56679	56663	56663	I	140	“ You were wrong . ”
56680	56710	56711	56711	she	97	“ I ’m about to be right . I have a feeling . A mother always has a feeling about her children . I was watching you today and … ”
56718	56765	56711	56711	she	97	“ … I do n’t know how to explain this , but it is close . I could feel it . But you are fighting this . I can tell . You ca n’t reject fate , Sam . Whatever it is , go to her . ”
56773	56792	56770	56770	I	140	“ She better fucking hope I do n’t go to her because everything I touch , I ruin . ”
57818	57825	57804	57804	I	140	“ I ’ll have that one , ”
57886	57889	57890	57890	I	140	“ Open . ”
57928	57935	57936	57936	she	1656	“ Hi ! I ’m Dani , ”
57946	58009	57936	57936	she	1656	“ Your bouncer showed me up . It ’s my first time at Badlands . Honestly , my friends are , like , kind of freaking out about all this . You calling me here , I mean . We heard about you a lot , obvs . But we did n’t even know you came to this place , like often … ”
58247	58274	58282	58282	I	140	“ … kind of down for anything , really . And , like , I know you only do casual , so that ’s totally okay — ”
58275	58281	58282	58282	I	140	“ How old are you ? ”
58308	58311	58312	58312	She	1656	“ What ? ”
58323	58329	58312	58312	She	1656	“ What do you mean ? ”
58330	58334	58335	58335	I	140	“ Your age , ”
58355	58360	58312	58312	She	1656	“ What is it ? ”
58361	58366	58312	58312	She	1656	“ Twenty … five ? ”
58367	58374	58312	58312	She	1656	“ Is that a fucking question ? ”
58375	58379	58312	58312	She	1656	“ No … ? ”
58380	58393	58394	58395	Her generation	1661	“ Then why do you keep putting question marks after your answers ? ”
58444	58450	58440	58440	she	1656	“ Show me your ID . ”
58463	58468	58451	58451	I	140	“ This is ridiculous . ”
58479	58489	58469	58469	She	1656	“ I ’m legal ! Everyone gets carded here . ”
58526	58536	58537	58537	I	140	“ You have five seconds before I blacklist you , ”
58541	58546	58547	58547	She	1656	“ From the club ? ”
58553	58558	58559	58559	I	140	“ From the city , ”
58562	58568	58569	58569	She	1656	“ Your ID , Dani . ”
58693	58697	58685	58685	I	140	“ Get out . ”
58698	58702	58682	58683	Charlotte McKinney	284	“ Mr. Brennan … ”
58703	58706	58685	58685	I	140	“ Out . ”
58707	58714	58685	58685	I	140	“ Age is just a number . ”
58715	58726	58727	58727	I	140	“ That ’s the stupidest thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
58797	58855	58790	58790	her	282	“ If age is just a number , then temperature is just a number , too . And money . And cancerous cells . And war casualties . Numbers are everything . Numbers are what separates life from death . Numbers run this world . There ’s no just about them . Now get the fuck out . ”
59011	59018	59000	59000	Her	463	“ I ought to kill you . ”
59040	59051	59052	59052	she	463	“ That would n’t be out of character for you , ”
59058	59067	59052	59052	she	463	“ What did n’t I do this time ? ”
59068	59073	59086	59086	she	463	“ You cockblocked me . ”
59074	59085	59086	59086	she	463	“ I was n’t even anywhere near you all day ! ”
59100	59124	59086	59086	she	463	“ You did n’t have to be . The PTSD of fucking you put me off the whole concept for life . Congratulations . ”
59125	59151	59152	59152	she	463	“ That ’s why you had to finger me again , right ? Just to make sure it really was that horrible the first time , ”
59156	59172	59173	59173	I	140	“ I fingered you to deny you an orgasm , not because I wanted you , ”
59177	59195	59173	59173	I	140	“ You really know how to woo a girl . No wonder I was obsessed with you . ”
59196	59199	59200	59200	I	140	“ Was ? ”
59217	59252	59173	59173	I	140	“ Last I checked , you are still running after me like a puppy and even took it to the next level and are now showing up at my place , creeper - style . ”
59253	59274	59173	59173	I	140	“ You show up at my place all the time , too . I do n’t call you a creeper . ”
59275	59303	59304	59304	I	140	“ That ’s different . I work with your father . I can not escape the sight of you , no matter how much I want to . ”
59334	59340	59341	59341	She	1673	“ Where have you been ? ”
59370	59402	59403	59403	I	140	“ Allow me to answer you with your favorite goddamn expression : none of your business . How did you find my address ? Do not say none of your business , ”
59406	59409	59403	59403	I	140	“ Google . ”
59410	59417	59418	59418	I	140	“ Do n’t lie to me . ”
59482	59489	59490	59490	she	1673	“ Do n’t ask tough questions , ”
59494	59500	59490	59490	she	1673	“ My address is untraceable . ”
59501	59517	59518	59518	She	1673	“ Well , Batman , I think both of us know that is n’t true . ”
59523	59548	59518	59518	She	1673	“ Can you remove your fingers from my neck ? I ’d hate to traumatize you further with skin - to - skin contact . ”
59754	59762	59746	59746	I	140	“ Look , can I come in ? ”
59827	59830	59831	59831	I	140	“ No , ”
59835	59844	59831	59831	I	140	“ I really need to talk to someone . ”
59845	59856	59831	59831	I	140	“ I suggest you turn to a person who cares . ”
59857	59865	59866	59866	she	463	“ You do n’t care about me ? ”
59943	59952	59953	59953	She	463	“ Not even a little . Go away . ”
59958	60006	60007	60007	she	463	“ I need to vent . It ’s about my parents . Everyone else has a horse in this race . My brothers , Mother , and Da … even my best friends are married to my siblings , so they ca n’t be clearheaded about it , ”
60131	60144	60145	60145	I	140	“ Fine . But I ’m not gon na fuck you again , ”
60186	60194	60195	60195	She	1694	“ Well , that ’s a relief . ”
60211	60228	60195	60195	She	1694	“ And I promise not to try to seduce you again . Now , shall we ? ”
60251	60258	60259	60259	she	1694	“ May I have some coffee ? ”
60263	60276	60277	60277	I	140	“ Would you like a fucking full English breakfast along with it ? ”
60286	60295	60277	60277	I	140	“ No , you ca n’t have coffee . ”
60296	60312	60259	60259	she	1694	“ I think we both need a few moments to gather ourselves before this conversation . ”
60313	60351	60352	60352	We	1695	“ The only part of me in need of gathering is getting my cock into someone ’s mouth , and since I do n’t want you anywhere near it , I suggest you cut to the chase . ”
60368	60385	60363	60363	She	1694	“ You ’re not going to talk until I get you a coffee , are you ? ”
60396	60401	60391	60391	She	1694	“ ’ Fraid not . ”
60664	60669	60670	60670	she	463	“ Let me go ! ”
60679	60687	60670	60670	she	463	“ Coming here was a huge mistake . ”
60688	60738	60739	60739	I	140	“ Could n’t agree with you more . Yet you ’re here , so you ’re sure as hell going to see this through . I know the Fitzpatrick clan is used to other people finishing shit for them , but this time you ’ll have to pull through . ”
60803	60820	60795	60795	she	463	“ Let me guess , there is a perfectly good explanation for the bullets , right ? ”
60849	60853	60854	60854	I	140	“ There is , ”
60857	60867	60854	60854	I	140	“ but you are not going to like it . ”
60868	60874	60875	60875	she	463	“ I ’m all ears , ”
60907	60911	60878	60878	I	140	“ You calm ? ”
60912	60921	60922	60922	she	463	“ Do n’t treat me like a baby , ”
60925	60932	60933	60933	I	140	“ Do n’t act like one , ”
60936	60953	60933	60933	I	140	“ Why do you have bullets in a jar ? Dozens of them , no less . ”
60954	60970	60971	60971	I	140	“ Why do you think I do n’t want people to get into my apartment ? ”
60997	61000	61001	61001	Her	463	“ Evidence . ”
61010	61025	61026	61026	Sam	560	“ I take the bullets out of the people I kill and keep them . ”
61112	61132	61101	61101	I	140	“ See this ? M.V. ? Mervin Vitelli . I engrave their initials , so I do n’t forget . ”
61133	61142	61143	61143	She	2875	“ Why do n’t you want to forget ? ”
61269	61293	61255	61255	She	2875	“ I knew you killed people , but it ’s very different to actually see proof of how many lives you ’ve taken . ”
61294	61343	61344	61344	I	140	“ The first one is the most meaningful one . After that , taking lives feels the same . Like a second or third bite of an ice cream cone . Of course , it does n’t hurt to know the people I kill are pieces of shit , ”
61347	61354	61355	61355	she	2875	“ I ’m not so sure , ”
61375	61384	61385	61385	I	140	“ You came here to talk . Talk , ”
61502	61511	61512	61512	Her	2875	“ My mother wants to file for divorce . ”
61528	61537	61538	61538	she	2875	“ I know it sounds ridiculous to you , ”
61543	61681	61682	61682	she	1715	“ After all , it ’s a well - known fact my parents have never been faithful to one another . Their marriage is considered a sham in most social circles of New England . But for me , it means something . It means a lot , actually . Growing up , I knew I had the stability of Avebury Court Manor . Even though Mother and Da were n’t a functional couple , they were still a couple in their own strange way . Believe it or not , Sam , they worked . I know I ’m not an impressionable teenager anymore and worse things happen to twenty - seven - year - olds . Some people lose their parents , their partners , even their children , but I just do n’t understand … ”
61700	61766	61682	61682	she	1715	“ … how everything escalated so quickly . One moment we were leading a normal life — as normal as life could be for us — and the next everything exploded . The provocative pictures of Da and that … that woman materializing out of nowhere , the poisoning . Someone is trying to ruin my father , and Athair thinks it ’s my mother . ”
61858	61866	61867	61867	she	1715	“ Do you really have no lead ? ”
61903	61934	61887	61887	She	1715	“ That ’s weird . You are usually so resourceful . I ca n’t recall the last time you could n’t help my family when we got ourselves into trouble . ”
61962	61967	61955	61955	I	140	“ Patience , Nix . ”
61968	61975	61887	61887	She	1715	“ Are you a patient man ? ”
61976	61991	61955	61955	I	140	“ I do n’t hold myself to the same standards I hold you to . ”
61992	61997	61955	61955	I	140	“ That ’s convenient . ”
61998	62005	62006	62006	I	140	“ I lead a convenient life . ”
62017	62045	62006	62006	I	140	“ Anyway , look at the bright side . Two houses . Two parents . Two Christmas trees . Two sets of presents and so fucking forth . ”
62046	62053	62054	62054	Her	1715	“ I ’m not a kid . ”
62065	62077	62060	62060	I	140	“ You sure act like one where your parents are involved . ”
62078	62090	62091	62091	Her	1715	“ What would you do if you were in my position ? ”
62120	62148	62111	62111	you	1720	“ Let them sort this shit out by themselves . They are grown - ups , and you are not the parent . You ’re the kid . ”
62252	62262	62263	62263	she	2875	“ I am sort of my mother ’s parent , ”
62266	62274	62263	62263	she	2875	“ She relies on me … mentally . ”
62275	62289	62314	62314	She	2875	“ That , to use the technical term , is fucked - up . ”
62290	62313	62314	62314	She	2875	“ Maybe , but it ’s the truth . My life is … not as pretty as it seems from the outside . ”
62494	62551	62552	62552	I	140	“ Boo - fucking - hoo , sweetheart . You ’re young , beautiful , and rich enough to buy happiness . So your parents are about to get a divorce and hate each other ’s guts . Welcome to the twenty - first century . You are officially joining fifty percent of people in the U.S. ”
62611	62622	62623	62623	she	2909	“ My life is not as charmed as you think , ”
62629	62694	62623	62623	she	2909	“ For one thing , growing up I never saw real love . A healthy relationship between a man and a woman . At least you had Sparrow and Troy . My childhood was an endless stream of arguments , object tossing , and my parents disappearing to Europe for months at a time , together or alone , leaving me with the nannies . ”
62722	62743	62744	62744	Her	2909	“ Then I lost someone I really cared about when I was seventeen , in a pretty … brutal way . ”
62784	62793	62794	62794	I	140	“ What else have you got for me ? ”
62811	62816	62817	62817	She	2909	“ My first time … ”
62838	62847	62832	62832	I	140	“ I lost my virginity to my professor . ”
62848	62854	62832	62832	I	140	“ How old was he ? ”
62855	62860	62832	62832	I	140	“ Forty - one . ”
62861	62865	62832	62832	I	140	“ And you ? ”
62866	62869	62832	62832	I	140	“ Nineteen . ”
62870	62874	62832	62832	I	140	“ That ’s — ”
62875	62878	62879	62879	She	2909	“ Disgusting ? ”
62909	62921	62890	62890	I	140	“ Yeah , I know . Wanna know the disgusting part ? ”
62922	62935	62936	62936	She	2909	“ I thought I already knew . He was forty - one . ”
62943	62996	62997	62997	she	2909	“ I found out three weeks after we started sleeping together that he was married with a kid . See , he did n’t wear a wedding band and lived in an apartment complex on campus , alone . He looked young and stylish and hung out with the students so often … ”
63009	63142	62997	62997	she	2909	“ … I wanted to lose my virginity to someone with experience , and I knew he had it . We continued seeing each other after we had sex . Until one day he just disappeared into thin air . Stopped answering my calls . Just got up and left . He did n’t even complete the academic year . I needed some sort of closure , so I found him . And , well , I found out why he left . Because of me . Because his wife , who taught at another university two states away , had found out and dragged him back home by the ear . When I found his new address , I made the mistake of driving down there and knocking on his door . ”
63180	63271	63164	63164	she	463	“ She opened the door and threw the phone he ’d used to call me . She started screaming at me in front of the entire neighborhood , calling me a whore , a homewrecker , a spoiled bitch . She said my mother is a slut , that everyone in America knows one of us does n’t belong to Fitzpatrick , then promised she would let all the hospitals in Boston know what I did . It was humiliating . Especially since I never knew this man was married . ”
63272	63284	63285	63285	I	140	“ Is that why you never tried for a hospital here ? ”
63309	63340	63288	63288	She	1734	“ Partly . Maybe . I do n’t know . It ’s not the entire reason , anyway . Since then , I limited my interaction with men even more . ”
63341	63344	63345	63345	I	140	“ Good , ”
63348	63354	63345	63345	I	140	“ We ’re all fuckers . ”
63388	63394	63395	63395	She	1734	“ Tell me something personal . ”
63403	63419	63395	63395	She	1734	“ Just one thing , Sam . It will make me feel better . Please . ”
63420	63431	63367	63367	She	1734	“ Aisling , it ’s time for you to go . ”
63432	63435	63395	63395	She	1734	“ Why ? ”
63436	63543	63395	63395	She	1734	“ Because this is going nowhere fast . We fucked . It was a mistake . It ’s time you move on . Whatever you think is going to happen , I can assure you it wo n’t happen . I do n’t have a soul , or a heart , or a conscience . We had fun , yes , but women are all the same to me . I will never choose you above all others . If you think life with Gerry is a nightmare for your mother , imagine your father at his worst and keep going . That would be me . ”
63587	63592	63593	63593	I	140	“ Goddammit , woman , ”
63670	63798	63799	63799	I	140	“ When I was a kid , before Troy and Sparrow took me in , back when I lived with Cat and my grandmother , we had a painting in our house . Just the one . It was a very cheap painting . A faded old thing of a cabin on a lake — basic and not very good . Anyway , the painting was in front of the bed in the master bedroom . It had the tendency to fall from its nail onto the floor every time the door creaked or someone breathed in the house . Cat was the only person with a key to the master bedroom , and she had n’t figured out I ’d learned how to pick a lock . ”
63852	63949	63844	63844	she	140	“ When I was a kid , Cat used to punish me by starving me . In order to do that , she made the spot under her bed a makeshift pantry . That ’s where she kept all the food . Condiments , chips , pretzels , ready - made meals . Grams was n’t strong enough to fight her on this . As you know , I was a shitty kid , so I was virtually in a constant state of punishment . That made me very hungry and very small for my age . ”
63990	64062	63983	63983	I	140	“ At some point , I figured I could just break into the room and grab Ramen or a bag of chips or something . And I did . Often . But Cat had the tendency to come in at the most inconvenient time . When I did n’t have time to run away from her room , I had to hide under the bed , buried beneath the junk food . ”
64090	64144	64077	64077	Aisling	463	“ Cat was a whore , so more often than not , when she came home , she was n’t alone . I stopped counting after the fourth time I had to sneak under her bed and felt the springs of the mattress digging into my back as someone fucked her above me . ”
64159	64162	64163	64163	she	463	“ No , ”
64166	64169	64163	64163	she	463	“ Yes . ”
64178	64337	64170	64170	I	140	“ I felt the weight of my mother ’s sins , figuratively and literally . They fucked her over my back . Again and again and again . While I shivered , dizzy with hunger , every muscle in my body strained so I would n’t make a sudden move and make myself known . My most distinct childhood memory is that stupid painting . Every time the headboard hit the opposite wall , it would drop , but not facedown , so I could always see the cabin and the lake staring right back at me , as if they caught me red - handed . We had a relationship , this painting and I. I felt like it was taunting me . Reminding me of my shitty life , and every time I looked at it , I could feel the blue and purple dents on my back from the rusty bedsprings digging into my skin . ”
64338	64346	64347	64347	she	1740	“ You do n’t have any paintings , ”
64381	64384	64374	64374	I	140	“ Nope . ”
64385	64395	64396	64396	I	140	“ My house must be very triggering for you . ”
64427	64434	64374	64374	I	140	“ I do n’t have triggers . ”
64435	64440	64441	64441	she	1740	“ Everyone has triggers , ”
64444	64470	64471	64471	She	1740	“ Not me . I let hate fester and redirect it into ambition . I welcome my weaknesses and do n’t shy away from them . ”
64512	64520	64521	64521	she	1740	“ Is this why you hate women ? ”
64524	64532	64521	64521	she	1740	“ Because Cat wronged you so much ? ”
64533	64551	64552	64552	I	140	“ I do n’t hate them . I just do n’t want much to do with them , ”
64555	64566	64567	64567	She	1740	“ Well , I want something to do with you . ”
64605	64608	64592	64592	I	140	“ No . ”
64616	64652	64609	64609	I	140	“ Here . You got it off of your chest , and even got a little bonus with my sob story . Now get the fuck out , Nix . And do n’t come back . ”
64653	64657	64658	64658	She	1740	“ But I — ”
64800	64803	64804	64804	I	140	“ Shit … ”
64816	64823	64804	64804	I	140	“ Shit . Shit . Shit . ”
65214	65217	65218	65218	Cillian	128	“ Well ? ”
65303	65317	65298	65298	I	140	“ Could n’t find anything , and he did n’t volunteer any information . ”
65318	65345	65298	65298	I	140	“ Of course you could n’t . Because Sam has better things to do with his time than to mess with Athair for no apparent reason . ”
65346	65363	65298	65298	I	140	“ He was the only person at the table capable of poisoning one of the guests . ”
65364	65418	65298	65298	I	140	“ Athair had an oopsie visit to the hospital . Give that pretty head of yours a rest , Ash . Sam is innocent — in this case , of course . In general , he is probably responsible for every other bad thing that happened in Massachusetts since 1998 . Case closed . ”
65438	65465	65424	65424	he	560	“ Tell me you ’ll drop it . I have enough on my plate as it is . I do n’t need to extinguish another fire . ”
65466	65469	65470	65470	I	140	“ Fine , ”
65474	65483	65470	65470	I	140	“ I wo n’t sniff around him anymore . ”
65484	65487	65488	65488	he	560	“ Promise ? ”
65491	65494	65488	65488	he	560	“ Promise . ”
65769	65780	65750	65750	Sailor	106	“ This is his version of sending me dick pics . ”
65781	65789	65790	65790	Persy	225	“ But it ’s not a dick . ”
65798	65806	65807	65807	Belle	167	“ Not an anatomical one , anyway , ”
66317	66373	66374	66374	Mother	2875	“ Aisling , could you be a darling and ask your brothers to go say hi to Mr. Arlington ? He made such a substantial donation to our charity tonight , and I know he ’s been vying for Cillian ’s attention for a long time . He needs advice about his new offshore company . ”
66604	66623	66626	66626	her	2875	“ I will , but for the record you ’ll have to talk to them at some point , ”
66647	66745	66634	66634	She	2875	“ Have to ? I doubt it . I have to speak to my banker at some point to settle everything ahead of the divorce . And my landscaper — the rosebushes need a proper trim . Oh , and certainly my hairstylist . But my sons ? There is nothing I need from them . If I want to see my grandchildren , I can talk directly to their wives . I would actually prefer that as Sailor and Persephone at least treat me like their equal and do n’t believe I poisoned my own husband . ”
66746	66756	66757	66757	I	140	“ Speaking of your husband , what about him ? ”
66773	66800	66757	66757	I	140	“ Will you be talking to him anytime in the next century , or are you going to spend the rest of your life dodging him ? ”
66801	66887	66634	66634	She	2875	“ Your father and I seem to have reached a boiling point after simmering over the edge of disaster for decades . He ’s become paranoid and wrongfully mistrusting . Quite vulgar , seeing as I ’m not the one who pops into the headlines every few months with a new affair . I hate to say this , Aisling my dear , but we might have reached the end of the road . I do n’t see us coming back from this particular crisis . ”
66888	66905	66906	66906	I	140	“ Well , then I suggest you speak to him before you hand him divorce papers . ”
66911	66918	66906	66906	I	140	“ He wo n’t believe me . ”
66919	66923	66906	66906	I	140	“ Try him . ”
66924	66935	66936	66936	Mother	2875	“ Just tell your brothers to do as I say , ”
67107	67117	67118	67118	I	140	“ May I borrow you two for a moment ? ”
67122	67150	67151	67151	Hunter	615	“ May ? I ’d pay you good money to get me out of here . Extra if you agree to put a bullet in my head , ”
67195	67201	67202	67202	Hunter	615	“ What ’s going on ? ”
67226	67289	67219	67219	he	615	“ The party ’s in full swing and the donation box is jam - packed . Do n’t tell me the old bat found a reason to be unhappy again . Let me guess , the flowers are not fresh enough or someone failed to compliment her on her dress — which , by the way , makes her look like drywall . ”
67304	67321	67290	67290	I	140	“ She asked if you two could introduce yourselves to Mr. Arlington , right over there . ”
67359	67383	67411	67411	Cillian	128	“ He made a sizable donation and would like to ask you a few questions . Offshore business - related , I believe . ”
67384	67410	67411	67411	Cillian	128	“ Since when did I sign up for Mother pimping me like I was a low - grade call girl in need of petty cash ? ”
67437	67462	67428	67428	I	140	“ You need to take some of the workload off of me . I ’m the one she manages twenty - four - seven . ”
67463	67467	67468	67468	Cillian	128	“ Your choice , ”
67473	67479	67468	67468	Cillian	128	“ Speaking of fat checks … ”
67489	67508	67485	67485	Hunter	615	“ … the Devil himself just entered the ballroom , and he brought an expensive - looking date . ”
67590	67603	67604	67604	Hunter	615	“ And he brought a replica of our sister , no less , ”
67654	67710	67635	67640	A man I did n’t know	1820	“ They say he killed his first victim at thirteen . Under the guidance of his adoptive father , Troy Brennan . I worked at the DA ’s office at the time . Read the postmortem report . The damage he inflicted was frightening . You know , we never found the bullet he used . ”
67720	67730	67731	67731	Hunter	615	“ He is my brother - in - law , ”
67737	67758	67731	67731	Hunter	615	“ So unless you wish to share a fate with that poor corpse , I suggest you take a hike . ”
67759	67762	67763	67764	The man	615	“ Oh … ”
67770	67779	67763	67764	The man	615	“ I had no idea . My apologies . ”
67951	67960	67941	67941	Sam	560	“ Saw Congressman Weismann heading out just now … ”
67976	67999	67961	67961	Sam	560	“ … your mother must ’ve pulled some strings to get him to show his face here after the undocumented housekeeper scandal . ”
68000	68037	68038	68038	Cillian	128	“ I understand that you have the manners of a soiled diaper , but in cultured society , it is expected to introduce your date to your friends , which is what you will do now , ”
68124	68132	68133	68133	Sam	560	“ Getting a little touchy , Kill . ”
68138	68171	68172	68173	The woman	1817	“ It ’s just a woman . They make over fifty percent of the world ’s population , last I checked . Is Persephone failing in her duties to keep you entertained ? ”
68222	68227	68228	68228	Sam	560	“ This is Becca … ”
68245	68284	68285	68285	He	560	“ … Becca , this is Cillian , the CEO of Royal Pipelines , and Hunter , my brother - in - law and the head of the PR department of the company . And this is Aisling … ”
68308	68337	68306	68306	me	140	“ She is their younger sibling , of undisclosed occupation . I ’m sure it is something interesting , but I never mustered enough interest to find out . ”
68338	68344	68345	68345	Cillian	128	“ Aisling is a doctor , ”
68348	68355	68356	68356	Sam	560	“ And I ’m Marie Antoinette . ”
68360	68365	68356	68356	Sam	560	“ Fancy some cake ? ”
68366	68385	68386	68386	Hunter	615	“ The first time you acknowledge my sister , and you talk to her like she is trash . ”
68392	68406	68386	68386	Hunter	615	“ Now I remember why none of us wanted you anywhere near her . ”
68407	68415	68416	68416	I	140	“ Hello . I ’m right here ! ”
68429	68456	68416	68416	I	140	“ No need to fight my battles for me . Also , I think it ’s time to use your right to remain silent , Brennan . ”
68468	68482	68483	68483	He	615	“ Nothing that comes out of your mouth is worth listening to anyway . ”
68517	68542	68510	68510	we	1838	“ Is it shark week for the entire Fitzpatrick clan ? I hear women who live together get their period at the same time . ”
68543	68561	68562	68562	I	140	“ I suspect you lost all rights to make blood jokes with your track record , Sam . ”
68582	68587	68570	68570	He	615	“ Touché , Nix . ”
68607	68610	68603	68603	my	140	“ Nix ? ”
68675	68698	68671	68671	I	140	“ Oh , do tell them the story of how I got my nickname , Sam . It ’s a good one . ”
68826	68836	68818	68818	Sam	560	“ You sure you want me to tell them ? ”
68837	68847	68848	68848	Cillian	128	“ Now ’s not the time to act chivalrous , ”
68851	68895	68848	68848	Cillian	128	“ Aisling and you have never exchanged as much as a sentence , yet you have a nickname for her ? You ’re going to have to give me an explanation , seeing as I pay you extra not to touch my sister . ”
69021	69042	69008	69008	Sam	560	“ It was the first time I saw your sister . At dinner when Sailor and Hunter started living together . ”
69063	69164	69165	69165	He	1850	“ I excused myself to go to the bathroom just as she got out of it . Her dress was stuffed inside her underwear from behind , her ass and legs on full display . I told her that she needed to untuck her dress . She cried in horror and said , ‘ Oh , no , my knickers ! ’ She explained to me that underwear are called knickers in British English . Since then , I call her Nix , because she is a goofball who ca n’t dress properly . Is n’t that right , Nix ? ”
69206	69213	69190	69190	Sam	560	“ Since when do you date ? ”
69226	69235	69214	69214	Hunter	615	“ Since I changed my mind about marriage . ”
69236	69244	69245	69245	Cillian	128	“ You changed your mind about marriage ? ”
69275	69310	69259	69259	My	140	“ Riveting . I clearly remember you giving me a one - hour speech about the merits of staying single shortly before I married Persephone . Should I bill you for my lost time ? ”
69311	69315	69316	69316	Sam	560	“ People change . ”
69323	69332	69316	69316	Sam	560	“ You should know that better than anyone . ”
69333	69342	69259	69259	My	140	“ People , yes . Monsters , no . ”
69343	69350	69351	69351	Hunter	615	“ So is Becca the one ? ”
69421	69426	69427	69427	he	560	“ I hope so , ”
69438	69469	69427	69427	he	560	“ She has everything I look for in a woman . Beautiful , well - educated , and honest . Bonus points : her family is not a complete mess . ”
69495	69519	69486	69486	Becca	302	“ Anyway , I delivered the message Mother sent me here for . Do with it what you will . Enjoy your evening . ”
69847	69871	69838	69838	I	140	“ I have an early shift tomorrow . I ’ll catch up with you in the morning . It was a lovely event . ”
70000	70005	69993	69993	I	140	“ Oh my gosh ! ”
70127	70147	70123	70123	you	1869	“ My , my . You give tacky a whole new meaning , do n’t you , Mr. Brennan . ”
70186	70227	70228	70228	I	140	“ You know , Samuel , that ’s what separates the nouveau riche from true aristocrats . Your impartialness to knockoffs . Could n’t get your hands on the real thing , so you decided to settle for a replica . ”
70293	70329	70330	70330	I	140	“ Did you tell her you hate women ? That you do n’t want children ? How much you loathe yourself ? Did she see your apartment ? Your inside ? All your dirty secrets ? ”
70374	70387	70371	70371	I	140	“ Yeah . I guess not . A word to the wise … ”
70393	70442	70388	70388	I	140	“ … run , do n’t walk . He is trouble and not the tamable kind . He will use you , play you , and discard you . That ’s the only thing he knows how to do . Because that ’s what was done to him . ”
70734	70739	70740	70740	He	1876	“ Are you done ? ”
70777	70781	70782	70782	I	140	“ Step aside , ”
70786	70792	70782	70782	I	140	“ I want to leave . ”
70793	70806	70807	70807	He	1876	“ You ’re very prone to dramatics , know that , Nix ? ”
70838	70877	70817	70817	He	1876	“ I am used to women who are rougher around the edges . Sparrow . Sailor . Even Cat . They have masculine strength about them . They refuse to be pushed around and never shed a tear . ”
70878	70886	70887	70887	I	140	“ Crying does n’t make you weak , ”
70897	70909	70910	70910	He	1876	“ It just means you ’re in touch with your emotions . ”
70915	70959	70910	70910	He	1876	“ I did n’t say you were weak . But you are a complex little thing , and I never know if I get the ball - busting version of you or the docile one who trails behind her mother like a toddler . ”
70960	70977	70978	70978	He	1876	“ Thank you for the psychological assessment . Did you enjoy your rendezvous with your date ? ”
70988	71007	71008	71008	I	140	“ What ’s with the French words ? Why not say hookup like the rest of modern civilization ? ”
71011	71022	71008	71008	I	140	“ My governess was French . It stuck with me . ”
71023	71029	71030	71030	he	1876	“ You had a governess , ”
71053	71090	71040	71040	he	1876	“ Well , as it happens , I did n’t enjoy Becca at all because you scared the living shit out of her . This is now the second fuck you ’ve cost me , Nix . ”
71091	71098	71099	71099	I	140	“ Nix like knickers , right ? ”
71142	71151	71131	71131	He	1876	“ I had to think on my feet . ”
71152	71159	71160	71160	I	140	“ I think I should go . ”
71183	71186	71172	71172	he	1876	“ No . ”
71187	71197	71131	71131	He	1876	“ Sam , you have a date waiting inside . ”
71198	71208	71172	71172	he	1876	“ She left . I called her an Uber . ”
71209	71221	71222	71222	I	140	“ You still brought her here . That ’s the point . ”
71235	71250	71222	71222	I	140	“ You still paraded her . Flaunted her . Kissed her in the cloakroom . ”
71251	71258	71259	71259	he	1876	“ I did n’t kiss her , ”
71268	71277	71259	71259	he	1876	“ But when I came in you were — ”
71278	71284	71285	71285	he	1876	“ I skipped that part , ”
71288	71302	71285	71285	he	1876	“ The kissing part . I wanted you to get the general picture . ”
71303	71306	71307	71307	I	140	“ Well … ”
71310	71366	71367	71367	I	140	“ … I got it , all right . Mission accomplished . I now know you will go to extreme lengths to push me away . We have such a frightening ability to get under each other ’s skin in the worst , most terrible way . I think I ’m finally done with you . ”
71409	71423	71424	71424	he	1876	“ Why do I have a feeling you are playing me , Aisling ? ”
71443	71450	71433	71433	I	140	“ Who said I was n’t ? ”
71451	71483	71433	71433	I	140	“ Your doe - like , please - don’t - eat - me eyes . But I ’m starting to see there ’s much more to you than I initially thought . ”
71484	71505	71506	71506	I	140	“ Your opinion of me was n’t very high in the first place , so that ’s not saying much . ”
71521	71568	71510	71510	He	1876	“ I checked your IRS file . You do n’t have an income . Whatever you do is either voluntary or paid under the table . With your family going through audits every single year , I doubt you are stupid enough to meddle with money . ”
71569	71572	71573	71573	I	140	“ What ? ”
71578	71583	71573	71573	I	140	“ How dare you — ”
71584	71613	71614	71614	I	140	“ Easily . That ’s how . Now it ’s your turn to answer a question . What is it that you do in this clinic , Nix ? ”
71707	71712	71713	71713	I	140	“ Pull me back ! ”
71727	71730	71731	71731	He	560	“ Please ! ”
71753	71807	71731	71731	He	560	“ I do n’t think so , sweetheart . First , you owe me a few truths . You ’ll start by telling me what you did outside my apartment a week ago . Because looking back , you could n’t have come there just because you needed a shoulder to cry on . ”
71808	71812	71813	71813	I	140	“ I did ! ”
71819	71822	71813	71813	I	140	“ I — ”
71823	71831	71832	71832	he	560	“ You took one of my bullets , ”
71968	71973	71974	71974	I	140	“ Let me go ! ”
71977	71983	71974	71974	I	140	“ You sure about that ? ”
72021	72031	71974	71974	I	140	“ Why did you take the bullet , Nix ? ”
72032	72037	71974	71974	I	140	“ Sam , please — ”
72038	72042	71974	71974	I	140	“ Answer me . ”
72043	72048	72049	72049	I	140	“ I ’m scared , ”
72058	72072	72049	72049	I	140	“ Tell me the truth and you ’ll have no reason to be . ”
72073	72088	72089	72089	I	140	“ Because I knew it was from the man you killed at the carnival ! ”
72099	72191	72192	72192	He	1886	“ My obsession with you started right after that damned carnival . I checked the news to see who was killed there , guessing correctly that they ’d found the body . I found his name — Mason Kipling — and read that he was a human trafficker who had been wanted by the FBI . I put two and two together . Realized you had some beef with the guy . When I saw the bullet , M.K. , I could n’t help myself . I took it . Happy ? ”
72252	72263	72264	72264	His	1886	“ Now tell me why you came to my apartment . ”
72285	72288	72264	72264	His	1886	“ No . ”
72289	72299	72264	72264	His	1886	“ Tell me what you do in that clinic . ”
72300	72303	72264	72264	His	1886	“ No . ”
72304	72307	72308	72308	He	1886	“ Aisling … ”
72463	72470	72471	72471	he	1886	“ You ’re going to fall , ”
72527	72542	72521	72521	My	140	“ So are you . I ’ll be taking you with me , Monster . ”
72543	72553	72554	72554	His	1886	“ I ’m not afraid of falling , Nix . ”
72571	72592	72595	72595	his	1886	“ Yes , you are . That ’s why you ’re torturing me . That ’s why you ’re here . ”
72680	72698	72677	72677	I	140	“ Next time you pull a Becca stunt on me , I will cut your balls off . ”
72699	72708	72709	72709	His	1886	“ I ’d like to see you try . ”
72727	72730	72731	72731	he	1886	“ Fuck , ”
72734	72744	72731	72731	he	1886	“ Why ca n’t I stay away from you ? ”
72773	72785	72786	72786	I	140	“ You really need to quit smoking . You smell horrible , ”
72789	72796	72786	72786	I	140	“ Never heard any complaints before . ”
72797	72805	72806	72806	I	140	“ They were all scared of you . ”
72961	72991	72992	72992	I	140	“ No one wants to put a mirror to your face because they know you wo n’t like what you see there . Everyone is afraid of your wrath , ”
72995	72999	72992	72992	I	140	“ And you ? ”
73042	73049	73060	73060	I	140	“ Are you scared of me ? ”
73050	73059	73060	73060	I	140	“ I was never truly scared of you . ”
73075	73143	73060	73060	I	140	“ Not when I was seventeen and not a decade later . To me you ’ll always be beautifully misunderstood . And maybe I ’m an idiot to care , Sam . In fact , I probably am , but I still want you to quit smoking because I want you to grow old and gray and be healthy . Even if I can never have you . ”
73174	73179	73180	73180	Sam	560	“ Aisling , I — ”
73215	73224	73196	73196	him	1886	“ Someone call 9 - 1 - 1 ! ”
73225	73231	73196	73196	him	1886	“ We need an ambulance ! ”
73232	73242	73243	73243	I	140	“ Oh , dear God ! What ’s happening ? ”
73350	73355	73356	73356	he	754	“ The family heirloom ! ”
73359	73387	73356	73356	he	754	“ Where is it , Jane ? Tell me now . I know that it ’s you who stole it . You who sent those threatening letters . ”
73929	73936	73937	73937	Someone	305	“ Give us a ride home . ”
73972	73980	73966	73966	Sparrow	463	“ Did n’t know you were here . ”
74003	74032	74033	74033	Sparrow	463	“ Got here ten minutes ago from dinner with friends just to drop off the check . We stayed for the entertainment . Our taxi driver has left . ”
74066	74074	74063	74063	her	463	“ No heavy petting in the backseat , ”
74090	74096	74097	74097	Troy	952	“ Ca n’t promise anything , ”
74100	74118	74119	74119	I	140	“ Well , I can . I ’ll push you out on the highway without even blinking , ”
74134	74142	74127	74127	I	140	“ Your wife , I ’ll spare . ”
74154	74169	74147	74147	Troy	952	“ So , when are you going to quit your blood - thirsty vendetta ? ”
74230	74239	74227	74227	Mine	1930	“ I ’ll stop when he comes clean . ”
74240	74246	74247	74247	Troy	952	“ That might never happen , ”
74251	74258	74259	74259	I	140	“ Then I might never stop , ”
74263	74271	74259	74259	I	140	“ Are you planning to kill him ? ”
74326	74332	74320	74320	I	140	“ I do n’t know . ”
74333	74341	74342	74342	Troy	952	“ That ’s a first , smartass , ”
74345	74348	74342	74342	Troy	952	“ Huh ? ”
74349	74363	74364	74364	Troy	952	“ You . Not knowing shit . You ’ve always been like this . ”
74376	74396	74364	74364	Troy	952	“ Took what you wanted , even if you had to set the world on fire in the process . ”
74397	74412	74413	74413	I	140	“ It ’s called being a go - getter . Not a bad thing , ”
74428	74438	74439	74439	Sparrow	463	“ That depends on how you look at it , ”
74444	74455	74439	74439	Sparrow	463	“ It might be a very bad thing for you . ”
74456	74464	74465	74465	I	140	“ Cut the riddles , Dr. Seuss . ”
74473	74498	74465	74465	I	140	“ If you have something to say , say it , and be fast about it . I outgrew tonight about three days ago . ”
74499	74514	74515	74515	Troy	952	“ What your mother is saying , and you are too stubborn to comprehend , ”
74534	74559	74523	74523	his	952	“ is that what you want might end up not wanting you back if you slaughter everything on your way to get to it . ”
74560	74568	74569	74569	Sparrow	463	“ Do you know what you want ? ”
74586	74589	74590	74590	I	140	“ Yes , ”
74598	74607	74590	74590	I	140	“ I want you both to fuck off . ”
74608	74624	74625	74625	she	463	“ No , Sam . You think you want revenge . But what you want … ”
74632	74642	74625	74625	she	463	“ … what you really want is completely different . ”
74643	74666	74667	74667	I	140	“ Even if I wanted the things you think I want , getting them would ruin everything . I ’m a monster , ”
74702	74724	74691	74691	Sparrow	463	“ If a monster can be made , it can be unmade , too . Good night , my darling boy . ”
74788	74798	74799	74799	I	140	“ I do n’t want Aisling , you fools . ”
74806	74813	74799	74799	I	140	“ But I will have her . ”
74861	74866	74867	74867	Mother	2875	“ He is gone ! ”
74897	74924	74867	74867	Mother	2875	“ His things are gone . Suits . Clothes . Laptops . Briefcase . The only thing he left is his wedding band , the bastard ! ”
74989	74994	74982	74982	we	1944	“ Mother , I — ”
74995	75002	75003	75003	she	2875	“ I did n’t do it ! ”
75013	75060	75003	75003	she	2875	“ You believe me , do n’t you ? It was n’t me . I swear . Not the poisoning . Not the cufflinks . I mean , heavens , Aisling , we both know how obsessed he is with those cufflinks . I would never ! ”
75061	75066	75067	75067	I	140	“ I believe you , ”
75099	75119	75093	75093	her	2875	“ But I ’m going to need some time to get to the bottom of all this . Okay ? ”
75120	75131	75132	75132	She	2875	“ You must help me , Aisling . You must . ”
75242	75248	75234	75234	I	140	“ Get up , Mother . ”
75279	75284	75285	75285	she	1948	“ I ca n’t , ”
75288	75306	75307	75307	She	1948	“ Oh , Aisling , this is such a nightmare . I need something for my nerves . ”
75333	75413	75327	75327	I	140	“ I ’m not prescribing you anything , Mother . I ’m not a psychiatrist . You need to see a professional who will assess you . Besides , you should adopt some coping mechanisms . Bad things happen to everyone . Life is about rising to the occasion , any occasion . Think of life as a garden . You do n’t choose where to be planted , but you can only choose whether to bloom or wither . ”
75414	75457	75458	75458	She	1948	“ Oh but , Ash , it is hard to bloom in the storm . All I need is a little pick - me - up . I even have a list of things that might help . It ’s right here . ”
75487	75526	75477	75477	I	140	“ That ’s a lot of pills . Some of them are strong . Zoloft . Prozac … you can not mix them together , and you definitely ca n’t consume alcohol if you take any of them . ”
75601	75611	75612	75612	She	1948	“ You have n’t taken any , have you ? ”
75631	75639	75620	75620	I	140	“ For goodness ’ sake , Mother ! ”
75640	75654	75655	75655	Jane	2875	“ Just get me the medicines and get to the bottom of this . ”
75900	75946	75881	75881	she	2875	“ I need to get to work . Please get yourself in the shower and brush your hair . Maybe go on a walk or see friends . You need to start taking care of yourself , Mother . I wo n’t live here forever . ”
75957	75965	75966	75966	She	2875	“ No one has asked you to ! ”
75978	76006	75966	75966	She	2875	“ And go , why do n’t you . Go when I need you . Just do n’t come crying at my grave when you lose me . ”
76047	76061	76062	76062	I	140	“ I ’m calling your psychiatrist as soon as I get to work , ”
76084	76093	76075	76075	he	2875	“ You can be mean , you know ? ”
76104	76110	76094	76094	She	2875	“ Just like your father . ”
76111	76117	76118	76118	I	140	“ I ’m not mean . ”
76125	76131	76132	76132	She	2875	“ But I am tired . ”
76349	76406	76342	76343	Pierce Brosnan	311	“ You know , Aisling , you ’re a brilliant young doctor . You should find a residency and start next year . Tell your future employer you took a gap year to spend some time with your family or to do some traveling . This clinic is no place for someone as promising as you . ”
76407	76413	76414	76414	I	140	“ I like working here . ”
76450	76473	76441	76441	I	140	“ We ’ve already been through this , Greg . You know why I ’m doing this . This is my calling . ”
76474	76496	76497	76497	he	1980	“ And I appreciate your life experience has brought you here . I ca n’t help but feel guilty , too … ”
76509	76538	76497	76497	he	1980	“ … such medical talent should n’t be wasted in some underground , illegal clinic . You are a Harvard graduate , Fitzpatrick . Top of the crop . ”
76539	76548	76549	76549	I	140	“ How long have you felt this way ? ”
76559	76563	76564	76564	he	1980	“ Long enough , ”
76592	76610	76611	76611	I	140	“ Please do n’t shackle yourself in unearned guilt . You are much too pragmatic for that . ”
76652	76662	76663	76663	he	1980	“ We ’ll talk about it some other time , ”
76666	76690	76691	76691	I	140	“ Fine , but if you think you ’re getting rid of me so easily , you have another thing coming , Greg , ”
76697	76703	76691	76691	I	140	“ Close the place up ? ”
76735	76756	76757	76757	he	1980	“ Actually , I have to run . A patient just paged me . Mind locking up before you leave ? ”
76763	76768	76769	76769	I	140	“ Not at all ! ”
76775	76792	76769	76769	I	140	“ Go ahead . It ’s been a moon and a half since I closed shop . ”
76903	76927	76890	76890	You	1989	“ Too late , Nix . I know you ’re in there . Your car is parked directly in front of the doorway . ”
76978	77023	76952	76952	I	140	“ We can do this the nice way or the not - so - nice way . But you should know , my not - so - nice ways include smashing doors down , rummaging through places , and doing very dangerous fucking things . ”
77024	77029	76952	76952	I	140	“ Go to hell . ”
77030	77048	76952	76952	I	140	“ Ca n’t . Satan has a restraining order against me . Now open the damn door . ”
77049	77054	77055	77055	I	140	“ I hate you , ”
77069	77076	77055	77055	I	140	“ No , you do n’t . ”
77077	77081	76952	76952	I	140	“ I should . ”
77082	77092	77055	77055	I	140	“ No fucking shit , Sherlock . Open up . ”
77163	77168	77169	77169	he	560	“ You kill people , ”
77197	77235	77179	77179	He	560	“ I finally figured it out . Even though it was in front of me all this time , in plain sight . You kill people . That ’s what you do . Mercy killing . Euthanasia . ”
77285	77405	77268	77268	His	560	“ That ’s why you limit yourself to very few patients . That ’s why it ’s an underground operation . That ’s why you keep all the drugs you have in here . That ’s why you treat them at their homes . It all makes sense . You ’re not here to cure people , you ’re here to kill them . The only question is why ? Why are you , the sweet , caring Aisling Fitzpatrick , doing this ? Your brothers always told me you wanted to be an OB - GYN or a pediatrician . Something with babies involved , they said . The exact opposite of what you turned out to be . ”
77478	77485	77462	77462	I	140	“ You ca n’t prove it . ”
77486	77500	77513	77513	I	140	“ I do n’t need to . You ’ll tell me your truth . ”
77501	77512	77513	77513	I	140	“ While you ’re keeping so many secrets from me ? ”
77521	77532	77513	77513	I	140	“ Nice try . Why are you here , Sam ? ”
77542	77608	77538	77538	he	140	“ I find it hard to believe my job means so much to you . Whether I cure or kill people , it makes no difference to you . You owe me nothing , and your job is not to watch over me . In fact , it is the very opposite — to stay away from me . So why are you pushing this ? ”
77631	77682	77613	77613	He	140	“ I do n’t fucking know , Aisling . I have no idea what keeps bringing me back to you , but I ca n’t seem to stop , and you do n’t seem to mind , so let ’s just get this out of our system and fuck already . ”
77936	77939	77940	77940	he	560	“ Goddammit , ”
78057	78071	78072	78072	I	140	“ I sincerely hope you do n’t intend to ask me to stop . ”
78077	78084	78072	78072	I	140	“ No . Do n’t stop . ”
78085	78114	78115	78115	His	560	“ You know , growing up , I never played kiddie games . I graduated from formula to guns without a pit stop at toy cars and puzzles . ”
78146	78154	78136	78136	he	560	“ Want to play doctor and patient ? ”
78176	78187	78188	78188	His	560	“ All right . Open up for me , Nix . ”
78217	78230	78231	78231	He	560	“ Glove up first , Doc . First drawer on your left . ”
78298	78305	78306	78306	he	560	“ I ’m new at this , ”
78317	78337	78306	78306	he	560	“ so you ’ll have to excuse me in advance as I conduct this pap smear , Miss Fitzpatrick . ”
78338	78345	78311	78311	his	560	“ Please , call me Nix . ”
78346	78356	78357	78357	he	560	“ Sorry , I do n’t treat Knicks fans , ”
78411	78438	78390	78390	I	140	“ My name has nothing to do with the basketball team . It ’s after an enticing female monster . Does that put you at ease ? ”
78439	78442	78447	78447	Sam	560	“ Definitely . ”
78477	78485	78486	78486	he	560	“ You might experience some discomfort here , ”
78519	78523	78524	78524	he	560	“ Miss Fitzpatrick , ”
78527	78533	78524	78524	he	560	“ control yourself , please . ”
78534	78539	78540	78540	I	140	“ S - sorry , ”
78590	78593	78594	78594	I	140	“ Oh ! ”
78597	78611	78612	78612	He	560	“ Still ca n’t get to that right angle . Better try again . ”
78683	78695	78696	78696	I	140	“ H - how did you learn how to do this ? ”
78727	78738	78709	78709	he	560	“ You look like you know what you ’re doing . ”
78739	78748	78749	78749	I	140	“ Got accepted to premed after high school . ”
78769	78774	78764	78764	he	560	“ You ’re serious . ”
78811	78816	78817	78817	He	560	“ Dead fucking serious . ”
78837	78845	78846	78846	I	140	“ You thought about becoming a doctor ? ”
78849	78901	78846	78846	I	140	“ Hell no . I made a bet with a friend I could get into premed . Did n’t study for it either . But I read a gynecology book on one of my train rides to New York City while attending an arms deal and got the gist of it . ”
78945	78950	78951	78951	Sam	560	“ Always so dramatic , ”
78987	79020	78967	78967	he	560	“ Sorry , Miss Fitzpatrick , but I could n’t find what I needed . This might be a little unorthodox , but I think I know how to finish this exam . ”
79100	79103	79104	79104	I	140	“ Merde , ”
79107	79117	79118	79118	he	560	“ I fucking love it when you say that , ”
79210	79215	79207	79207	his	560	“ Please . Ohhhhh . ”
79338	79346	79331	79331	he	560	“ Found what you were looking for ? ”
79368	79373	79359	79359	He	560	“ And then some . ”
79409	79420	79421	79421	He	560	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m fucking you again . ”
79430	79434	79421	79421	He	560	“ Believe it . ”
79442	79457	79421	79421	He	560	“ Because I doubt you can do this with anyone else at this point . ”
79458	79462	79421	79421	He	560	“ Shut up . ”
79463	79521	79421	79421	He	560	“ You know it ’s true . That ’s why you could n’t have sex with that woman at the ball , who looked exactly like me . You know what you want , Sam ? You just do n’t want to take it because the consequences would mean you ’d lose my daddy ’s fat paycheck . ”
79522	79533	79534	79534	He	560	“ I do n’t give a fuck about your daddy . ”
79554	79590	79540	79540	I	140	“ Then what is it ? Please do n’t tell me you actually convinced yourself you are bad for me . You do n’t have a conscience , and I can make my own decisions . ”
79591	79596	79540	79540	I	140	“ Shut . Up . ”
79597	79601	79602	79602	I	140	“ Make me . ”
79673	79680	79681	79681	He	560	“ There . That ’s better . ”
79686	79696	79681	79681	He	560	“ Never have I fucked a more infuriating creature . ”
79697	79700	79701	79701	I	140	“ Furrryerrr , ”
79709	79725	79726	79726	He	560	“ Yes , sweetheart , that ’s exactly what I ’m doing . Fucking you . ”
79771	79778	79779	79779	he	560	“ Are you on the pill ? ”
79809	79820	79800	79800	he	560	“ Yes , I was , since I was fifteen . ”
79821	79825	79826	79826	He	560	“ Never mind . ”
79835	79856	79826	79826	He	560	“ Even if you are n’t , you are going to take the morning after pill . Am I clear ? ”
79947	79951	79952	79952	I	140	“ Get out . ”
79958	79967	79952	79952	I	140	“ Now . And do n’t come back . ”
79990	80017	79952	79952	I	140	“ Lighten up , Nix . I heard you when you said you were on the pill . I just like to see you getting pissy . ”
80018	80042	79952	79952	I	140	“ Well , congratulations , you succeeded . You think it ’s okay to tell a woman what to do with her body ? ”
80043	80049	80050	80050	He	560	“ Depends on the woman . ”
80053	80056	80057	80057	I	140	“ Out ! ”
80095	80098	80082	80082	I	140	“ Out ! ”
80099	80103	80104	80104	He	560	“ Or what ? ”
80110	80130	80104	80104	He	560	“ You ’ll call the police to come and pick me up from your unregistered death clinic , Nix ? ”
80131	80166	80167	80167	I	140	“ Or I will tell my brothers you ’ve screwed their baby sister twice now , despite getting … oh , what is it , an extra million just to stay away from me ? ”
80194	80202	80203	80203	I	140	“ Do n’t come near me again , ”
80207	80215	80221	80221	he	560	“ That wo n’t be a problem . ”
80952	80959	80960	80960	she	463	“ Her name was Ms. Blanchet , ”
81004	81168	80986	80986	She	463	“ My governess . Her name was Ms. Blanchet . She died when I was seventeen . On the night I met you , actually , at the carnival . I drove there after I found her . She had cancer . Lung cancer . She battled it for three years . The last few months , she spent in a hospice but then decided she wanted to die at home and not in a strange place around people she did n’t know and meant nothing to her . So she moved back to her apartment in the West End . She was sick , Sam . So very sick . She could n’t eat , or breathe , or laugh without feeling pain . She started peeing in her bed at night , voluntarily , after she ’d woken up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom one time and fell in the hallway , breaking her hipbone . “
81243	81324	81232	81232	she	2040	” There was a pause . Silence hung in the air . Reluctantly , I grabbed a fistful of her dress and pulled her in , shutting the door behind us . My penthouse was the only apartment on the floor , but I still did n’t want to take any chances of anyone listening to this . We left the groceries outside . Aisling twisted her fingers together , staring at her feet , determined to finish her confession . “
81439	81440	81441	81441	You	2049	” “
81447	81531	81532	81532	She	2047	” I said tersely , but she and I both knew it was bullshit . Life did n’t care about your age , bank account , or circumstances . Life just happened . I was thirteen when I assumed my role as Troy ’s successor . I ’d crushed skulls , put bullets in people ’s heads , tortured , killed , manipulated , and kidnapped people . Because life happened to me , and to stay alive , I had to adapt . “
81551	81605	81539	81539	She	2047	” Aisling stood there , by my door , tears streaming down her face . I made no move to console her . It was n’t what she needed in that moment , even an emotionally stunted dirtbag like me could see it . She had to get this confession off her chest . “
81650	81658	81634	81634	she	2052	” she said pointedly , eyeing me . “
81725	81749	81750	81750	I	140	” Her throat bobbed with a swallow , and she raked her shaky fingers through her hair as she took a ragged breath . “
81839	81851	81834	81834	her	2052	” she looked sideways then to the floor , closing her eyes “
81921	81922	81923	81923	Nix	140	” “
81925	81969	81923	81923	Nix	140	” I said , my voice gravelly . Suddenly , I forgot about being sick . I forgot about existing in general . Her pain took over the room and everything else ceased to exist . She shook her head , laughing bitterly . “
82026	82083	82017	82017	I	140	” The carnival where I snatched her first kiss simply because she was too sweet not to take advantage of . Where she saw me taking a life . Aisling saw two dead people in less than twelve hours after living a too - sheltered life . It must have been a shock to the system . “
82095	82099	82017	82017	I	140	” her chin quivered “
82150	82172	82141	82141	You	2062	” She looked up at me for confirmation , her eyes swimming with tears . I gave her a curt nod . “
82189	82220	82181	82181	I	140	” Except for when I touch you … then I become a pussy - ass dipshit with a fever who ca n’t keep a damn meal down . She nodded . “
82252	82253	82254	82254	You	2062	” “
82259	82263	82254	82254	You	2062	” I challenged . “
82266	82267	82254	82254	You	2062	” “
82405	82467	82398	82398	You	2069	” She sniffed . I got it . All of it . Why she did what she did . How she had become who she was . A Nix . A gorgeous vision of a woman , hiding an enchanting monster underneath . But I did n’t agree with her . She was n’t put on this earth to kill people . “
82472	82477	82398	82398	You	2069	” I asked softly . “
82513	82553	82554	82554	I	140	” I said nothing . I ’d never truly loved anyone , so it did n’t seem like I could contribute to that observation . She stepped toward me , the fog of death and mourning around her evaporating . “
82821	82822	82823	82823	He	310	” “
82827	82869	82823	82823	He	310	” I said , staring her dead in the eye . Nix nodded , walking briskly in the kitchen ’s direction , popping cabinets open , taking out a chopping board then walking back to the door to retrieve her groceries . “
82964	83006	82962	82962	Sam	560	” She collected the carrots , the celery , the chicken thighs , and the broth , chopping the vegetables and meat on the board and tossing them all into a pot for what I assumed was a chicken noodle soup . “
83108	83109	83112	83112	your	2099	” “
83116	83195	83112	83112	your	2099	” I asked , propping my forearms on the kitchen island between us , intrigued . I ’d met many killers in my lifetime , but all of them were like me . Decadent and soulless . Selfish and cruel . They all did it for the bloodthirst . Not for altruistic reasons . Even those who had moral codes broke them often . What Aisling did had nothing to do with what I did for a living . “
83295	83316	83284	83284	we	2100	” She put the pot of soup on the stove , turning up the heat , lost in her explanation . “
83401	83402	83409	83409	their	2107	” “
83412	83416	83409	83409	their	2107	” I said . “
83419	83437	83438	83438	We	2100	” She put a lid on the chicken soup , tearing open a bag of egg noodles . “
83453	83454	83438	83438	We	2100	” “
83464	83465	83467	83467	I	140	” “
83486	83487	83467	83467	I	140	” “
83491	83505	83467	83467	I	140	” I trailed off . She bounced on her toes , looking sideways . “
83514	83515	83518	83518	Ash	133	” “
83520	83534	83518	83518	Ash	133	” I planted my forehead over the kitchen island , relishing its coolness . “
83544	83548	83518	83518	Ash	133	” She sighed . “
83576	83577	83573	83573	I	140	” “
83591	83624	83625	83625	Cillian	128	” I raised my head , pinning her with a look . Of course she knew that . Aisling was n’t stupid . She tilted her chin up , ignoring my words . “
83671	83672	83662	83662	I	140	” “
83677	83691	83662	83662	I	140	” I slammed my open palm against the marble between us , losing patience “
83720	83721	83715	83715	You	2109	” “
83735	83759	83732	83732	you	2109	” Nix perched her purse on the counter and took out a thermometer , sauntering over to me and sticking it under my tongue “
83773	83810	83771	83771	Monster	441	” I glared at her like she took a shit in my bed , waiting for the thermometer to beep . When it did , I spat it out back into her hand , and hissed , “
83817	83818	83771	83771	Monster	441	” “
83821	83846	83771	83771	Monster	441	” she snorted , rounding the kitchen island and taking a few pills from her purse , reaching over to hand them to me . “
83869	83877	83878	83878	I	140	” Eyeing her skeptically , I said , “
83900	83926	83883	83883	Doc	176	” She shrugged , about to withdraw her outstretched hand . I snatched the pills , shoving them into my mouth and swallowing without water . “
83955	84133	83942	83942	you	176	” Kicking her out was n’t going to fly . Not when I could barely crawl to the door , let alone shove her out of it . And anyway , I was tired of fighting her off . She ’d finally succeeded in worming her way into my life . I saw a distinction between her and Gerald . Between her and her brothers . Nix was finally her own person in my eyes . And what a person that was . Gorgeous , intelligent , and compassionate . Worst of all — someone who was blindly in love with me . She did n’t have to spell it out . It was radiating from every inch of her silken flesh . I did n’t deserve her . I could have her if I wanted . I staggered to the couch and fell onto it . Nix balanced herself on the edge , right beside me , looking at me expectedly , like Rooney anticipating story time . I ran my fingers through my damp hair . “
84138	84139	83942	83942	you	176	” “
84148	84151	84152	84152	I	140	” Rascal . “
84161	84162	84152	84152	I	140	” “
84194	84215	84152	84152	I	140	” Eyeing her with new fondness I was n’t even entirely sure I was capable of feeling , I chuckled . “
84279	84280	84282	84282	you	2119	” “
84290	84310	84282	84282	you	2119	” She ran her fingers through my hair , fixing whatever the hell I did to it , smiling . “
84351	84352	84344	84344	I	140	” “
84364	84369	84344	84344	I	140	” I pointed out . “
84384	84385	84375	84375	Cillian	128	” “
84392	84393	84386	84386	They	2121	” “
84398	84402	84408	84408	Nix	140	” She sighed . “
84410	84434	84408	84408	Nix	140	” She smiled , dipping her hand into the bullet jar wistfully , slipping in the missing bullet she ’d stolen from there . “
84438	84446	84447	84447	You	140	” I croaked , closing my eyes . “
84456	84561	84447	84447	You	140	” I drifted off to sleep , even though I tried hard to stay awake . It reminded me of the first few Christmases I spent with the Brennans . The fight against exhaustion was like swimming against the stream , but something good was happening , and who the fuck knew when would be the next time I ’d feel this elusive , intoxicating joy ? Aisling must ’ve slept right beside me because I could still feel her heat when I woke up . Her scent of ginger and honey and my fucking undoing . I yawned , stretching on the couch . “
84565	84749	84447	84447	You	140	” I growled , but there was no response . I opened my eyes , looking around . There was a bowl of steaming chicken noodle soup by my side , a bottle of water — uncapped — and some pills . Aisling was gone . The next day , I met with Barbara McAllister on the outskirts of Boston . She was a hobo - looking woman , not in the hipster , bought - that - holed - shirt - for - three - hundred - bucks way , but in the seriously - need - a - sandwich way . You could tell that underneath the bleached hair , wrinkled face , and badly applied self - tan , she ’d once been an attractive woman . Barbara was the final blow I needed to bring Gerald down to his knees . The missing piece in Operation Destroy Gerald . She held some deep secrets he never wanted anyone to know , and for a healthy sum of money , she was willing to air them out to the world . “
84779	84932	84774	84774	I	140	” Barbara asked when we ’d met in a small coffee shop . She wore a black mini - dress and a cheap trench coat , and it looked like the ‘ right price ’ for her would be twenty bucks and a McMeal . I silently offered her my open pack of cigarettes , keeping my expression blank . I still soldiered through my plan for Gerald Fitzpatrick , but I was no longer gleeful about it . Somewhere along the road , hurting Aisling , which I knew I was bound to do , felt unnecessary . It was n’t that I was going soft . It was that there was no need to be harsh to a woman as pliable as her . So fucking pliable that she runs an underground death clinic and seeks you out . Barbara lit up a cigarette , exhaling with a satisfied smile . “
84961	84967	84953	84954	Gerald Fitzpatrick	754	” She eyed me skeptically . “
85018	85048	85052	85052	he	754	” I smirked at her , setting the bait to make her say more . She grinned , her teeth unusually white for a smoker , and nodded enthusiastically . “
85123	85150	85112	85112	he	560	” My jaw tensed . I did n’t need to hear about my brother - in - law ’s sexcapades before he married my baby sister . “
85154	85158	85112	85112	he	560	” I asked . “
85172	85256	85112	85112	he	560	” Barbara rubbed her chin . It struck me as interesting that although Gerald had put her on the list , too , when I asked about her , he ’d lied to me . Some of the details he had given me were different from what I ’d found when I conducted my own research . Addresses , where they ’d met , her age . Nothing lined up , so I decided to dig deeper . I was glad I did . “
85264	85270	85271	85271	Gerald	754	” She cleared her throat . “
85355	85390	85346	85346	I	140	” She looked around the small coffee shop with the peeling wallpaper and dusty surfaces . She lived in a small , deserted town . It was obvious she was n’t swimming in it . “
85418	85456	85416	85416	one	940	” She sucked on the cigarette I gave her greedily , ignoring the disturbed glances the barista behind the counter shot at her — though she did n’t approach us or tell her to put it out . “
85459	85464	85416	85416	one	940	” I said easily . “
85536	85557	85533	85533	I	140	” She nodded , finishing off her cigarette and taking a sip of the stale coffee I ’d bought her . “
85566	85587	85590	85590	sweetheart	140	” I laughed , standing up and tossing the pack in her lap before disappearing back into the white blizzard . “
85598	85785	85786	85786	Mother	2875	” I smelled it before I saw it . The puke . Then when I noticed the first spot , I realized they were everywhere . Vomit stains . Yellow and faint , covering the carpets , the floor , the walls . I dropped my backpack at the door , following their trail up the stairway , where they led . It was unlike the housekeepers to leave any sort of dirt unattended . Unless they wanted me to see it . It was a cry for help , I knew . And not just from my mother . Lord , what did she do now ? I reached the second floor then rounded the hallway , my stride picking up speed . Just as I expected , the puke stains led to the master bedroom , my mother ’s room . Athair had left days ago , and even though I tried my best to keep an eye on her , I knew Mother was spiraling . I stopped outside her door , putting my hand on the doorknob and drawing a deep breath . “
85788	85830	85831	85831	Mother	2875	” There was no answer . I threw the door open , flashbacks of Ms. B attacking my memories , raw and vivid . Blood . Bath . Wrists . Despair . I scanned the room . It was completely empty . “
85833	85920	85831	85831	Mother	2875	” I echoed , confused . Cautiously , I made my way into the en - suite bathroom , my heart in my throat . I hoped for the best but expected the worst . Mother , rehashing that scene at Ms. B ’s apartment , finally making good on her idle threats to take her own life . I knew my mother was a cutter . It actually provided me a screwed - up sense of security because people who cut were less likely to perform “
85922	85998	85999	85999	Mother	2875	” suicide attempts . Jane Fitzpatrick was n’t even entirely a cutter . Sometimes she bruised herself a little , well and far away from the wrists , to draw attention . But she almost exclusively did this for my father ’s and my viewing . Hunter and Cillian had no idea . They were n’t pawns in her emotional blackmail scheme . I found her lying on the floor by the vanity , facedown . “
86001	86122	85999	85999	Mother	2875	” I cried out , rushing to the bathroom , swinging the door open . I fell down on both knees , turning her over by the shoulder . She was passed out cold in a pond of her own vomit . Half - dissolved pills were swimming in the vomit like little stars , their content , powdery and thick . Like stardust . Jesus . I grabbed her hair , shoving my fingers into her mouth , forcing her to gag and throw up more . She came to life instantly , at first protesting weakly about my hurting her as I held her head , but then she started puking more . More pills . More everything . “
86131	86152	85999	85999	Mother	2875	” I groaned , calling an ambulance with my free hand as I continued trying to make her throw up . “
86158	86329	85999	85999	Mother	2875	” But I knew exactly what she ’d done and why . The ambulance arrived four minutes later . I followed it with my own car . I tried to call Hunter and Cillian repeatedly . Both their phones went straight to voicemail . I could n’t understand why . It was nighttime . They should be at home with their families . I resorted to texting both of them our code word . Our emergency code . Clover . And then , when there was no answer : Clover , clover , clover ! Pick up ! Reluctantly , I did n’t want my sisters - in - law to know the extent of how screwed - up my family was , especially with Da living out of the house and my parents probably getting a divorce . I called Persy . Persephone and I always had this unspoken connection , of two , shy and romantic wallflowers forced to blossom in the jungle that was the Fitzpatrick family . “
86332	86341	85999	85999	Mother	2875	” Pers sounded drowsy , drunk with sleep . “
86346	86360	86344	86344	Hi	325	” I said chirpily , feeling idiotic for forcing on a cheerful tone . “
86385	86386	86381	86381	he	128	” “
86395	86413	86381	86381	he	128	” she asked and then , processing the fact I asked her a question , she added , “
86450	86628	86443	86443	I	140	” My blood sizzled in my veins as I gripped the steering wheel to a point of having white knuckles . My brothers were ghosting me . They ’d left me to tend to our mother while they went gambling with Sam Brennan . Fresh anger bubbled in my stomach . How dare Cillian and Hunter so easily accept a reality in which sweet , timid Aisling took care of Mother and Athair while they went to live their big fulfilling lives ? I pulled up at the hospital and ushered Mother to the ER along with her designated doctor , giving him as much information as I could based on what I knew . What drugs she may had taken , the quantity , how much of it she threw up . They ran some tests at the speed of light and pumped her stomach , but it was already mostly empty thanks to me . Mother was put on an IV drip and was conscious now , not even two hours after she got admitted . “
86653	86666	86645	86645	he	496	” she moaned , reaching for the remote by her hospital bed . “
86692	86708	86685	86685	I	140	” I stared at her through bloodshot eyes , my whole body shaking with rage . “
86714	86749	86711	86712	an idiot	464	” The words slipped from my mouth before I could stop them , but I could n’t for the life of me find a drop of remorse after they were out in the open . “
86753	86768	86771	86771	me	140	” Her head jerked sideways . She gave me a hard , motherly stare . “
86773	86793	86794	86794	You	2137	” I stood up , walking to the window , watching snow - caked trees and dirty ice roads . “
86848	86872	86873	86873	I	140	” I turned back around , fixing her with my own glare , my newfound spine tingling with the need to take action . “
86938	86939	86940	86940	Aisling	463	” “
86942	86946	86940	86940	Aisling	463	” Mother cried . “
86955	86956	86951	86951	I	140	” “
86959	86963	86964	86964	I	140	” I roared . “
87051	87056	87043	87043	I	140	” I spat out , “
87122	87999	87118	87118	I	140	” I flung my hands up in the air and stormed out , bumping into a doctor who scurried into Mother ’s room . He called out to me , trying to find out what was wrong , but I ignored him , feeling very young and very desperate all of a sudden . The drive back home was a blur . I was surprised I made it at all , seeing my unshed tears impaired my vision . I stormed into my mother ’s en - suite , opened the cabinets , and started throwing everything into a white trash bag I ’d taken from the pantry . Anything you could get high on was gone . I shoved it all in without rhyme or reason . Sunscreen , Vaseline , bandages , painkillers , and cough medicine alike . When I was satisfied with my findings , and sure there were no other drugs to be found in the house , I proceeded to stomp my way outside , hoisted the full trash bag into the trunk of my Prius , and floored it all the way to Badlands . I tried not to think about the last time I ’d seen Sam . I told him I never wanted to see him again then went ahead and knocked on his door . Not the most consistent I ’d been , but I was worried . When I ’d heard from Cillian , Hunter , and Da that Sam was nowhere to be found , I figured he was holed up in his apartment and for good reason . Honestly , I ’d been more afraid he ’d gotten shot or had a serious wound and was too proud to ask for help . I ’d found him sick and shivering , nursed him back to health , and then gave him the space he needed . That was three days ago . He never even said thank you . Not that I had any reason to expect him to . This was Sam I was talking about , a well - known monster . While I knew he would n’t hand me over to the authorities in a red satin ribbon , I also did n’t trust him with the information of what I was doing with my medical degree . Why did I share with him my story of Ms. B , then ? Because you love him , mon cheri , and when you love someone , you want them to get to know you , so maybe they ’ll fall for you , too . Well , Sam was obviously feeling much better , seeing as he was clubbing with my selfish brothers tonight . I stopped in front of Badlands , dragged the trash bag out , and rounded the building , toward the back door leading to Sam ’s office . I knew better than to knock . Which was why I took the tweezers out of the trash bag and tampered with the lock . It was a simple lock , and I had the advantage of knowing what I was doing . I ’d broken into my brothers ’ rooms plenty of times when I was younger . I was bored and alone in the impossibly large , looming Avebury Court Manor . Sometimes , my only company was other people ’s things . Toys and gadgets I had found under their beds . I ’d even pretended the women gracing the covers of Penthouse and Playboy — found under Hunter ’s bed — were my girlfriends . The door hissed open with a soft click , and I trampled inside . Sam ’s office was dark and empty . I threw the door open and headed downstairs , the music pounding from the club making the floor quake . I was n’t interested in the club , though . I headed straight to the card rooms . As soon as I reached the junction of the four card rooms , I peeked into each of them . It was n’t hard to find my brothers . They were in the last one . It was the noisiest , most boisterous room , filled wall - to - wall with men wearing tuxedos , smoking Cuban cigars and drinking old whiskey , huddled around roulette and craps tables . Cillian was in the corner of the room , talking animatedly with Devon , while Hunter was next to Sam by the roulette . The Monster looked brand - new , a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth as he barked at his employees , no hint of his previous , sweaty , fever - ridden self in sight . Swaggering inside , the trash bag flung over my shoulder like I was Santa delivering presents on Christmas Day , I stopped in the center of the room and emptied the content of the trash bag in the middle of the roulette table , a smile on my face . Everyone , and I do mean everyone , gasped . Everyone other than Sam . Hunter was the first to recover from my little stint . “
88011	88043	87118	87118	I	140	” He whistled low , reaching for the center of the roulette table to grab a pack of mints I ’d thrown in there accidentally , popping two into his mouth . “
88072	88073	88074	88074	Aisling	463	” “
88076	88089	88074	88074	Aisling	463	” Cillian said , all ice and manners , sauntered toward me . “
88105	88106	88074	88074	Aisling	463	” “
88110	88119	88122	88122	brother	2155	” I chirped , all honey and smiles . “
88287	88325	88326	88326	Everybody	2936	” The room turned very quiet and very still , and suddenly , I was only aware of Sam , Cillian , and Hunter . No one else registered . Sam snapped his fingers together and barked , “
88338	88344	88332	88332	Phil	331	” he turned to his croupiers “
88365	88425	88428	88428	You	331	” Sam sat back on one of the vintage armchair recliners , lighting himself another cigarette as he observed us . I turned my head toward him . I was in the mood to set fire to every single relationship I ’d ever had , and he was high on my list of people I wanted to snap at . “
88442	88447	88428	88428	You	331	” I gasped mockingly . “
88457	88467	88454	88454	I	140	” He lounged comfortably in his seat , smirking . “
88490	88491	88492	88492	You	331	” “
88497	88502	88494	88495	an asshole	2978	” I spat out . “
88511	88512	88504	88504	you	331	” “
88528	88543	88526	88526	Ash	133	” Cillian ordered as the last of the crowd trickled out of the room . “
88557	88558	88550	88550	Mother	2875	” “
88562	88571	88572	88572	She	2875	” I threw my arms in the air . “
88579	88587	88572	88572	She	2875	” Both my brothers paled in response . “
88648	88649	88650	88650	I	140	” “
88652	88679	88650	88650	I	140	” Cillian started , but I was so mad I cut him off . It was the first time I ever snapped at my older brother . “
88698	88699	88694	88694	You	331	” “
88706	88711	88704	88704	you	331	” Cillian maintained coolly . “
88724	88725	88704	88704	you	331	” “
88755	88756	88757	88757	Sis	334	” “
88759	88773	88757	88757	Sis	334	” Hunter said softly , reaching for my hand over the roulette table , “
88796	88797	88790	88790	You	331	” “
88800	88813	88814	88814	Mother	2875	” Cillian leaned a shoulder against the wall , looking gravely serious . “
88870	88871	88852	88852	you	331	” “
88879	88904	88905	88905	Mother	2875	” I fell onto a nearby stool , burying my face in my hands , hating that Sam was watching this whole freak show . “
88945	88946	88936	88936	I	140	” “
88953	88958	88947	88947	You	2176	” Cillian said firmly . “
88998	89002	88987	88987	Aisling	463	” Hunter nodded . “
89023	89093	89013	89013	You	615	” I tried to regulate my breaths . I could feel Sam ’s gaze on me . He seemed eerily quiet the entire conversation . Not that I expected him to weigh in on our family woes , but Sam was n’t a fan of gossip . Usually when he lost interest in something , he removed himself from the situation . Why did he stay in the room ? “
89102	89107	89108	89108	Her	2179	” I said quietly . “
89147	89188	89189	89189	You	2180	” At the same time , moving out and going cold turkey was something I did n’t want on my conscience . She needed me , learned how to be dependent on me , and leaving now would be cruel . “
89193	89197	89189	89189	You	2180	” Hunter agreed . “
89229	89230	89221	89221	we	2181	” “
89239	89258	89234	89234	Aisling	463	” Sam stood up , his voice toneless . I shot to my feet at the same time . “
89268	89269	89263	89263	I	140	” “
89284	89292	89280	89280	Sam	560	” Hunter gave me an apologetic look . “
89330	89331	89323	89323	We	2181	” “
89353	89385	89386	89387	The Windsors	336	” Devon drawled sarcastically , emerging from the shadows of the room . I forgot he was even here , which was an impossible task , seeing how gorgeous he was . “
89395	89396	89401	89401	Brennan	560	” “
89403	89411	89401	89401	Brennan	560	” Cillian barked in Sam ’s direction . “
89419	89420	89427	89427	Fitzpatrick	128	” “
89429	89469	89427	89427	Fitzpatrick	128	” Sam offered me his hand , helping me to my feet , leaving my brothers behind us . He pressed his hand to the small of my back , ushering me up the stairs back to his office . “
89475	89510	89427	89427	Fitzpatrick	128	” he asked tightly . I had an inkling the mere idea of pretending to care made his skin crawl , yet I oddly appreciated his concern , even if it was n’t genuine . “
89513	89519	89427	89427	Fitzpatrick	128	” I rubbed my forehead . “
89525	89526	89523	89523	Overstimulated	337	” “
89548	89549	89532	89532	I	140	” “
89570	89634	89635	89637	A dead Aisling	463	” I sighed , inwardly admitting the offer was very tempting . Sam was n’t going to go to war with Da and my brothers just to be with me . I came to terms with that a long time ago . So there was no point in accepting his offer and creating more tension between him and the men in my family . “
89650	89654	89655	89655	Charming	338	” Sam remarked . “
89672	89673	89662	89662	I	140	” “
89677	89684	89662	89662	I	140	” he asked , dead serious . “
89688	89695	89662	89662	I	140	” I felt my cheeks flush . “
89713	89714	89715	89716	Dangerous dick	339	” “
89725	89736	89715	89716	Dangerous dick	339	” He kicked the back door to his office open . “
89748	89815	89816	89816	They	2192	” We poured outside into Boston ’s December freeze . A thin layer of ice coated everything , from the ground to the buildings and glass panes of windows . Red , white , and gold Christmas decorations hung on the streetlamps twinkled back at us . Sam clasped the back of my neck possessively , leading me to his Porsche like I was his prisoner . “
89821	89827	89816	89816	They	2192	” I heard myself say . “
89905	89983	90178	90178	Sam	560	” Sam unlocked his car and helped me inside the passenger seat . The drive to my house was quiet . The first portion of it , anyway . When we reached the affluence of the Back Bay , a silver Bentley closed in on us from behind . Sam ’s eyes flicked to it in his rearview mirror . The Bentley sped up , kissing our bumper once and sending us flying forward with a jerk . “
89986	89990	90178	90178	Sam	560	” Sam muttered . “
90007	90008	90005	90005	Nix	140	” “
90011	90019	90005	90005	Nix	140	” My blood froze in my veins . “
90024	90025	90005	90005	Nix	140	” “
90030	90031	90005	90005	Nix	140	” “
90034	90103	90104	90104	Motherfucker	248	” Sam did n’t wait for me to finish my sentence . He took a sharp left turn , driving over the manicured lawn of someone ’s front yard as he sliced through a junction , not stopping at a traffic sign , and sped through a side street . The first bullet pierced the rear window and popped into the AC unit , where it got stuck . “
90106	90169	90104	90104	Motherfucker	248	” Sam hissed , still completely calm . He grabbed the back of my head roughly , dipping it further down , leaning toward me to ensure I was tucked away as carefully as possible . The car skidded , and I knew that the fact it had been snowing and the road was extra slippery did n’t work in our favor . “
90176	90177	90178	90178	Sam	560	” “
90180	90186	90178	90178	Sam	560	” I screeched , terrified , “
90201	90202	90193	90193	They	2196	” “
90208	90254	90193	90193	They	2196	” Another shot pierced through the rear window . It made it shatter completely . The glass came down in a sheet . Sam jumped on top of me , his torso covering my body , blocking me from harm , but still somehow driving . “
90260	90264	90265	90265	You	140	” I moaned . “
90275	90335	90336	90336	You	140	” He floored the accelerator . The car started to sound like a plane taking off . Then , without warning , he swiveled , making a sharp U - turn and speeding up again . Since my head was tucked firmly below my seat , I could n’t tell if we lost whoever was after us or not . “
90339	90343	90344	90344	I	140	” he asked . “
90348	90385	90344	90344	I	140	” I chanced a look at him through my periphery , noticing that his arm was bleeding . He caught a bullet while pushing me down to the floor . He took a bullet for me . “
90390	90402	90344	90344	I	140	” I said . He groaned but did n’t say anything . “
90407	90455	90344	90344	I	140	” I asked . Sam did n’t answer . I could tell he was concentrating on deciding which turn he was going to take next . I guessed driving home was out of the question . He was hardly going to lead his enemies to his doorstep . “
90460	90506	90507	90507	Bratva	236	” Tucked under the passenger seat , I pressed , my knees knocking against my chin as my teeth chattered . I ’d never been this scared in my life . The kind of fear that seeps into your bones and burrows into your soul . “
90512	90513	90509	90510	The Russians	215	” “
90518	90547	90514	90514	They	215	” I murmured . I knew that . Everyone knew that . My parents had n’t allowed me into their neighborhoods fearing I ’d get kidnapped for ransom . “
90551	90552	90553	90553	They	215	” “
90566	90567	90553	90553	They	215	” “
90622	90799	90800	90800	You	2203	” I heard another shot fired toward us . I squeezed my eyes shut , keeping my head bent , just like he told me . Sam took another sharp turn . He opened the glove compartment above my head , knocking my forehead in the process . He took out a gun , stopped the car , then reversed fast . He turned around and started heading in the Bentley ’s direction , releasing the gun ’s safety , a devious smirk on his face , his eyes zinging with determination . He is playing chicken . I wanted to claw his face to ribbons . The buzzing coming from the Bentley became louder , and I knew they were close . Sam stretched his arm outside his open window and fired two shots . Time and space hung above our heads , suspended . I heard a scream . A moan . Then footsteps over damp concrete , the crunching of the snow underneath someone ’s feet . Someone running . Fleeing . Sobbing . “
90806	90900	90800	90800	You	2203	” Sam murmured , stone - cold . Numb , I slid back to my seat , buckled up , and moved a shaky hand over my raven hair . Sam slowed his vehicle , and I noticed he was following a man . I only saw the back of him . A scrawny figure with blond messy hair and a prominent limp . He wore baggy sweatpants and matching hoodie . The glow - in - the - dark type . Sam directed his gun at his head , holding it steadily . “
90908	90912	90913	90914	Only cowards	2204	” I whispered . “
90936	91053	90923	90923	I	140	” I did n’t know if he was being sarcastic or purposely crass . Either option seemed completely unsuitable for the ears of a lady . But that was the essence of Sam Brennan . He would take a bullet for me without even thinking twice about it but trash - talk to the moon and back in my presence . The man stumbled on the uneven cobblestone of the sidewalk , trying to pick up his pace when he heard us driving by his side . It was futile . Sam had already caught him . The Monster was now playing with its food . The man ’s shoulders quaked , and he sniffled loudly . “
91056	91075	90923	90923	I	140	” I put a hand on Sam ’s arm , the one that was n’t holding the gun . “
91082	91268	90923	90923	I	140	” He ignored me , passing the man and parking in front of him , blocking his way . Our victim stopped . I leaned forward , taking a good look at him . Sam must ’ve killed his armed companion . The man was not a man at all . It was a boy . Of fourteen . Maybe fifteen at most . Gangly , long - limbed and wide - eyed , his pasty face sprinkled with acne . My heart lurched and twisted behind my ribcage . He was obviously a minor . Maybe even an innocent one . I imagined he was born and initiated into the Bratva . It was hard to believe he would choose such a life for himself . Sam got out of the car , blocking my view with his body , still protecting me , his gun aimed at the boy ’s head . The boy dropped to his knees , raising his arms in the air in defeat . He did n’t seem to even realize there was a second person in the car . “
91275	91302	90923	90923	I	140	” he sputtered , weeping so openly , so loudly , it felt like he tore my chest in two and watched while I bled out . “
91371	91395	91368	91369	a Brennan	2890	” He swallowed air , hiccupping , his face twisted in so much agony , it was hard to make out his features . “
91407	91412	91368	91369	a Brennan	2890	” Sam ground out . “
91415	91507	91510	91510	Sam	560	” I gasped . I shot out of the car , desperate to do something , anything to save this boy . I tackled Sam without thinking , trying to bring him down to the ground with me . But he was much bigger and heavier than I was . It felt like slamming headfirst into a concrete wall . I flew backward from the impact , but Sam snaked his free arm around my waist , jerking me behind him , like the boy still posed a threat to me . “
91514	91553	91556	91556	he	560	” I wrapped my arms around his chest and stomach and felt his muscles tensing against my fingertips through his shirt . A soft , barely audible groan escaped his lips . I took that as a sign . “
91602	91668	91669	91669	You	2213	” I held my breath , waiting for another stinging rejection and the pain that came with it . To my surprise , all I felt was a brief shudder passing through his torso . Goose bumps rose on my skin . I did n’t know why , but I felt this moment was monumental for both of us , though in very different ways . “
91703	91750	91752	91752	I	140	” Sam bared his teeth , lowering his gun just an inch . I let out a relieved breath , feeling nauseous with relief . My throat burned as I exhaled . I must ’ve screamed bloody murder while we were being chased in the car . “
91814	91821	91806	91806	I	140	” The teenager nodded almost violently . “
91831	91852	91806	91806	I	140	” He peeked at Sam through one eye , the other one squeezed shut in fear . Sam smirked crookedly . “
91879	91896	91872	91872	you	2215	” The kid did n’t try to beg for remorse . He bent his head obediently . “
91901	91923	91872	91872	you	2215	” Sam fired a shot , the bullet grazing the teenager ’s right arm , going straight through his nerve system . “
91959	91985	91949	91949	you	2215	” Sam chuckled . Blood pooled beneath the young man , but he did n’t make a move to press a hand to his wound . “
91995	92059	91949	91949	you	2215	” Sam hoisted me over his shoulder , blood still trickling down his arm , and led me to his car . His blood ran the length of my thigh , and I shivered with unexpected desire . I felt protected and wanted to protect him , and if that was n’t majorly screwed - up , I did n’t know what was . “
92083	92117	92118	92118	They	2218	” He tugged my pants and panties down my upper thigh , the cold night air stinging my skin . Sam sank his teeth into one of my ass cheeks , biting hard . “
92126	92159	92160	92160	They	2218	” I involuntarily thrust my thighs against his shoulder , begging for more . He opened the passenger door , tossing me inside and buckling me up like I was a toddler . “
92168	92169	92160	92160	They	2218	” “
92175	92184	92160	92160	They	2218	” I crossed my arms over my chest . “
92192	92196	92190	92190	Einstein	341	” he snapped . “
92213	92214	92207	92207	They	2218	” “
92224	92228	92222	92222	Becca	302	” I challenged . “
92238	92239	92222	92222	Becca	302	” “
92250	92259	92248	92248	Becca	302	” He rounded the car then started it . “
92264	92273	92274	92274	Becca	302	” A hysterical laugh bubbled from my throat . “
92285	92347	92274	92274	Becca	302	” He drove away from the Back Bay and outside city limits . Boston ’s skyline slid away through the windows , giving way to wildland . It made sense that Sam wanted to lie low for tonight , but what did that mean ? Were we going to stay together , wherever it was ? Where was he taking me ? “
92355	92359	92353	92353	Bella	167	” he said . “
92362	92366	92353	92353	Bella	167	” I snapped . “
92403	92404	92405	92405	Sparrow	463	” “
92410	92415	92416	92416	Troy	952	” I pointed out . “
92461	92462	92455	92455	your	2224	” “
92469	92527	92455	92455	your	2224	” I asked , tired of being repeatedly reminded how far from the realms of commitment Sam was . He did n’t want a wife , a family , children ; even though he protected me , prevented me from dying tonight , it was more about his newly found moral code than his affection toward me . “
92532	92556	92455	92455	your	2224	” Sam tapped a cigarette pack flat against his muscular thigh , fishing one and tucking it into the side of his mouth . “
92566	92567	92455	92455	your	2224	” “
92570	92578	92455	92455	your	2224	” I turned my head to the window “
92588	92612	92580	92580	I	140	” Sam chuckled , lighting up his cigarette , yet again ignoring my acute disapproval of what he was doing to his body . “
92618	92662	92613	92613	You	2224	” I said throatily , bracing myself for disappointment when he shut me down . I knew he would , too . Sam Brennan did n’t allow himself to feel anything . Especially toward women . His eyes remained fixated on the road . “
92665	92669	92613	92613	You	2224	” I demanded . “
92678	92679	92613	92613	You	2224	” “
92688	92692	92680	92680	You	2224	” I said . “
92728	92729	92720	92720	you	2224	” “
92739	92753	92757	92757	Nix	140	” I muttered . Why was I doing this to myself ? Why ? “
92794	93087	93088	93088	I	140	” I did n’t say another word the entire journey . I ’d already heard everything I needed to know . Sam may have been a good underboss , but he was a terrible potential realtor . He was being modest calling the place a cabin . It was more of a ranch , one like my brother , Cillian , owned . It was smack - dab in the middle of the woods . The place was so remote , there was n’t even a paved pathway for the car to get there . The Porsche trudged through gravel and sleet the last few miles to get to the front door . Sam got out of the car and threw the door open for me . I followed him inside as he began flicking the lights on . He turned on the central heating , scanning the living room and open - plan kitchen for any signs of a break - in . The place was freezing . First , I tended to the wound in his arm . Removed the bullet and did some light stitches . Then , I hugged myself , realizing all of a sudden that it was the middle of the night — two maybe three in the morning — and I still had n’t had lunch , dinner , or a shower . The last thing I ate was a Nature ’s Valley granola bar in the morning , and as we were all aware , those bars tended to crumble so badly you only consumed about thirty percent of them . My stomach growled , demanding to be fed , giving zero F ’s about the life or death situation I ’d just escaped . “
93098	93178	93088	93088	I	140	” Sam said without turning around , and my skin prickled with heat when I realized he must ’ve heard my stomach . As it turned out , there was absolutely nothing in the fridge . The heating was taking too long — maybe it was broken ; Sam said the place had n’t been occupied in years — so as far as a relaxing retreat went , this resort got one star and a scathing review on Yelp . “
93188	93192	93179	93179	You	2234	” Sam clipped . “
93196	93197	93198	93198	I	140	” “
93207	93233	93198	93198	I	140	” I stood on the opposite side of the room , looking down , humbled by my own privilege . Sam spun in my direction . “
93247	93248	93249	93249	I	140	” “
93259	93270	93249	93249	I	140	” I looked sideways , wanting to die of embarrassment . “
93277	93286	93271	93271	You	2234	” he reminded me . I nodded seriously . “
93330	93514	93322	93322	I	140	” With a growl , Sam opened a tin of refried beans using his metal key , tossing the can - shaped congealed beans into a pan . It looked about as appetizing as fresh manure and smelled similar . Still , I stood close to him as he prepared the food , mainly to catch the warmth of the fire coming from the stove . I ate straight from the pan . It was horrible , but I knew better than to complain . I imagined canned food was a luxury for him before the Brennans officially adopted him . I had no right to complain . As for me , I suspected this was the first time I ’d eaten anything from a can . I always had food made from scratch , prepared by our cook who used fresh produce , seasonal vegetables and fruit , and herbs . Of course I did n’t share this with Sam . Already , he mockingly referred to me as a princess . There was no need to give him any more ammo . “
93533	93591	93592	93592	My	140	” I took the pan to the sink and began to rinse it clean . The water was freezing cold . Sam sat at the dining table across from me , looking mildly entertained . I think he took joy from watching me do everyday chores . Little did he know I was my mother ’s maid . “
93604	93608	93592	93592	My	140	” he drawled . “
93625	93672	93675	93676	a brat	2239	” I said sarcastically , drying the pan and putting it back in the cupboard where it belonged . There were some refried beans still stuck to it . Call it my little revenge . I liked to take my wins where I could get them . “
93678	93686	93675	93676	a brat	2239	” His tone had an edge now . “
93698	93702	93675	93676	a brat	2239	” I sniffed . “
93737	93765	93727	93727	you	2240	” Rather than answering me with words , Sam got up , snatched a few throws from the couch , and stomped into one of the rooms . “
93804	94282	93790	93790	I	140	” I watched his back retreat , stunned with his brashness . He slammed the door behind him . I wondered why he ’d given me the master bedroom and not the extra one . Because , mon cheri , even though he says he does n’t like you , I suspect he really quite does . It was the first time Ms. B and I were n’t in complete agreement . Shaking my head , I carried my purse to the master bedroom , slipping under the blankets , which were cold as ice and did nothing to warm me up . For the next hour , I tossed and turned , staring at the patterned ceiling , wondering how they ’d decorated it . Sleep did n’t come , even when I willed it , begged for it . Adrenaline ran through my bloodstream like poison . The brush up with the Bratva . Sam saving me . The way he ’d rejected me before I ’d even offered myself up , all while cooking me dinner and giving me the master bedroom . Was he my protector or adversary ? I was tired of sorting through his mixed signals like it was Halloween candy , separating his actions by brand , intent , and flavor . Whatever his reasons might be for treating me this way , I intended to keep away from him . I was tired of chasing him around . Even though he ’d done his fair share of showering me with averse , cold attention every time he wanted to get in my pants , there was always a static undercurrent between us . I was the pursuer , and he was the somewhat amused , precious prize . He tossed me around and played with me whenever he had a few minutes to burn but always went back to ignoring my existence . This had gone on for a decade , reaching its peak these past weeks . And I knew , with a clarity that stole my breath away , that I could spend the next decade being his casual plaything just as easily if I let it happen . But I was n’t a teenager anymore . I had aspirations . Dreams . Goals . It was time to cut the cord . Not just with Sam but with everyone else in my life who assumed I ’d cater to their every need and whim . An hour and some change after I tucked myself into bed , I heard the door to the master bedroom creak open . I rolled in bed , turning toward the door . Sam stood on the threshold , fully clothed in his suit , his hair a tousled mess , like he ran his hand through it a thousand times . “
94293	94308	94309	94309	Romeo	222	” I rolled onto my back , sighing as I whispered to the ceiling . “
94318	94389	94309	94309	Romeo	222	” He chuckled , stepping inside , interpreting my sarcasm as invitation . Why would n’t he ? I ’d never denied him anything . Not when he intended to sleep with someone else the night I showed up at his apartment . And not at the charity event , when he brought a date who looked freakishly similar to me . And tried to sleep with her , too . “
94443	94444	94427	94427	I	140	” “
94455	94602	94447	94447	Sam	560	” He shifted closer but still far enough that I realized that despite everything — who he was , what he did , the general callousness of him — he was waiting for an explicit offer . He did n’t want to pounce and take me on his own terms . He wanted me to come to him willingly , desperately , lovingly . Neither of us made a move . I did n’t invite him into my bed . He did n’t leave the room . My thoughts swirled around in my head like the snowstorm outside , and I dug my heels into the mattress , refusing to give in to the urge to feel his body over mine , his skin against my own , his hot , sweet breath everywhere . His heat was irresistible in more ways than I could count . “
94605	94614	94447	94447	Sam	560	” he spat out , all but sneering . “
94624	94673	94447	94447	Sam	560	” Kicking off the blankets , I darted past him , out the door . He whirled , his brows pinching in a frown , following me to the living room . I plopped down on the carpet , jamming my feet into my sneakers , lacing up . “
94679	94683	94684	94684	I	140	” he growled . “
94769	94846	94847	94847	You	2247	” He stared at me like I was crazy . It was nighttime , and we were in the middle of the woods , in the midst of a never - ending snowstorm , with no cellular reception , no heat , and no food . He had a point . Scooping my phone , I slid my arms into the long plush sleeves of my coat . Sam stood there , motionless , watching me . “
94854	94859	94847	94847	You	2247	” he said dryly . “
94877	95025	94871	94871	You	2247	” I spat out , bitterness exploding on my tongue . I was hurting because of him , so I wanted to hurt him back . That was the excuse I gave myself , anyway , yet it did n’t make me feel any less horrible . It was probably exhausting to be him . To constantly look for people ’s weaknesses , press them where it hurt , and never allow yourself to be exposed . The word ‘ help ’ seemed to set him off . He pounced on me so quickly his movements were a blur as he slammed me against the floor , my back plastered against the parquet wood . His arms bracketed me on either side of my head . His body was flush against mine . I tried to kick him in the groin , but he dodged me easily . “
95052	95243	95244	95244	You	2250	” Feeling my eyes flaring , I was surprised to discover I did n’t fear him . I knew he was n’t going to hurt me . Not physically , anyway . After all , he said it himself — his kingdom was on the line . His fate was entwined with my family ’s . This was the way it had always been . It boggled my mind that I ’d ever thought he would stand against my father and my brothers . Insist on being with me . Even if he hated my family , he still needed it . For more money and power . We were his door to Boston ’s upper crust , and he was n’t going to let it slam in his face . Not because of me . If the men in my family paid him to keep his hands off of me and found out what we did in secret , in the dark , it would be the end of their business relationship . I also would n’t put it past Sam and Cillian to try to kill each other . “
95258	95270	95255	95255	you	2250	” I writhed underneath him , attempting to push him away . “
95296	95297	95255	95255	you	2250	” “
95306	95344	95255	95255	you	2250	” he said grimly , reaching for his boot and yanking out a small dagger . He took my fingers and curled them around the handle . He directed my hand to the center of his throat . “
95364	95405	95362	95362	Doc	176	” I slid the blade across his neck , to the pulsing artery calling for me , faint blue against his endless , smooth brown skin . My hands shook and my teeth chattered . His eyes bore into mine . “
95417	95497	95415	95415	Nix	140	” I tried to poke the blade against his skin , to push it through , to cut him , even a shallow nick , but I could n’t . I could n’t inflict pain on him . I caught my lower lip between my teeth , struggling , panting , trying desperately to push through , to make him bleed . I shook all over . The knife fell to the floor with a dull thud beside us . “
95502	95506	95415	95415	Nix	140	” I roared . “
95636	95724	95630	95630	I	140	” Getting it out there , in the open , felt like shedding old , dead skin . Even if I knew I was putting myself in a position of weakness , I was still happy that I did . If my confession stirred anything inside him , Sam did n’t let it show . In fact , he made it a point to keep my arms pinned with one hand as he jerked down his slacks , kicking my legs open and pushing my pants down . “
95740	95769	95630	95630	I	140	” I spat in his face , seething . Having him was a torture because it reminded me he would never be mine . He stopped undressing us . “
95777	95792	95793	95793	I	140	” His eyes were hooded , the hint of a sneer on his face . “
95803	95810	95795	95795	you	140	” I kept my voice steady , “
95821	95822	95812	95812	I	140	” “
95835	95836	95812	95812	I	140	” “
95940	95946	95936	95936	I	140	” I shook my head . “
95958	96009	96010	96010	You	2258	” We stared at each other . He knew this time was different from all the others . Because all the other times I tried to make light of things , to playfully banter with him while drawing closer and closer to him . Now , I wanted to leave . “
96014	96139	96140	96140	We	2259	” he rasped . I jerked my head in a nod . He sat up and let me go , allowing me to scurry backward toward the wall . I tugged my pants up . The truth of my statement hit me all at once . I was done with his games . Done with giving him what he wanted , whenever he wanted it . Done hoping he would someday wake up and realize he cared for me , too . He stood up and stared at me , blinking somberly , like I ’d just slapped him in the face . Maybe it felt that way . I doubted a man like Sam was used to hearing the word ‘ no . ’ “
96144	96160	96140	96140	We	2259	” he asked , businesslike . The icy edge to his voice made me shiver . “
96163	96172	96140	96140	We	2259	” I said , quickly retying my shoelaces . “
96201	96202	96140	96140	We	2259	” “
96213	96273	96206	96206	I	140	” He let the word ‘ love ’ roll out of his mouth like it was profanity . I licked my lips . Dawn was breaking outside beyond the pine trees , and the room began to wash with cool pinks and royal blues , the shadows framing his face making him look even more breathtakingly beautiful than usual . “
96341	96364	96336	96336	I	140	” I frowned then began to laugh . A throaty , screechy laugh , not even caring how unhinged I looked anymore . “
96454	96455	96456	96456	I	140	” “
96465	96466	96456	96456	I	140	” “
96476	96508	96456	96456	I	140	” He nodded once , sauntering over to the door and throwing it open . A chill rushed into the cabin , biting and claiming every inch of my exposed skin . “
96533	96876	96531	96531	Aisling	463	” He was letting me go . Maybe I was on a roll because of my own speech , or perhaps the adrenaline still pumped in my blood , but all at once , I gathered my courage , stood up , grabbed my purse , and fled out the door . He did n’t chase me . I knew he would n’t . Men like Sam never did . I followed the faint tire signs of the Porsche to find my way out of the woods , clutching my cell phone in a death grip . I slipped several times , and my knees and hands were soaked with melted snow . When I reached the main road , I called an Uber then continued walking . The foolish , desperate hope flaring in my chest that Sam would find me shrank more and more with each step I took . My toes were numb , my fingers had frostbite , and I could feel myself coming down with something . I played with the monster under my bed and felt the wrath of its claws on my skin . This was all on me . But that did n’t mean I had to put up with it anymore . It was like my love for him had snuffed out after teetering on the brink of death for a while . A love that started as a sun - shaped blaze when I was seventeen , big and hot and impossible to extinguish , but as time passed , Sam ’s actions doused water on it until there was barely anything left . I slipped into the back of an Uber , thinking about that night at the carnival . About the text I ’d seen scribbled on that bathroom . Maybe it was n’t meant for me . Maybe it was meant for someone with a happy ending . A few days after Aisling fled the cabin , Troy breezed into my office , tossing a newspaper onto my desk . “
96879	97195	96531	96531	Aisling	463	” I was sitting in front of a pile of Excel spreadsheets , trying to concentrate on the simple task of finding a way to help a client launder a couple of millions . Normally , I could do it with my eyes closed , hands tied , and dick buried deep inside a random . Shuffle the sum from place to place . Blow up expenses . Tamper with bank statements . Making money untraceable was an art form I ’d perfected from a young age . It made me a darling in certain corporate circles . Nothing bought your way into a rich man ’s heart better than helping him screw the IRS over . These last few days , however , my head was so deep inside my ass , I was surprised I did n’t drop dead from lack of oxygen . My thoughts were on a loop , getting stuck on the same thing over and over again . I saved Aisling . Put my life in danger to keep her from harm ’s way . And what did the bitch do ? She turned me down and cut me off . I glanced at the newspaper Troy threw at my desk . The headline smeared in cheap , black ink . Busted ! Billionaire Gerald Fitzpatrick ’s Mistress Writes an Explosive Tell - All ! Barbara McAllister ’s testimonies could be a game changer for the royal American family . The company ’s stock has dropped significantly since yesterday . It did nothing to improve my sour mood , even though I knew , in all probability , that Gerald was on the verge of hurling himself out the window from the skyscraper he was currently holed up in . Troy fell into the seat in front of me , lounging back , rolling a toothpick in his mouth . “
97255	97256	97246	97246	You	2267	” “
97278	97287	97288	97288	He	754	” I dropped my pen , sitting back . “
97290	97291	97288	97288	He	754	” “
97318	97330	97313	97314	Gerald Fitzpatrick	754	” Troy raised his palm up , cutting through my words . “
97385	97518	97519	97519	I	140	” Because then I ’ll have to face my other Fitzpatrick problem . The pressing one I ’ve been trying to ignore for weeks . Their daughter . Aisling stayed far away from me since she fled the cabin in the middle of the night like a dumb horror flick side character , the first to get murdered ten minutes into the film . I knew she survived our little showdown because I drove by her clinic the following afternoon , just to make sure she had n’t been chopped up by an axe murderer on her way out of the woods . Her Prius was parked in front of the main door . She was alive , even if not well . Consequently , she was also done with my ass . “
97524	97528	97519	97519	I	140	” I insisted . “
97555	97559	97546	97546	we	2274	” Troy snapped . “
97587	97599	97605	97605	Sam	560	” Troy stood up , spitting his toothpick on the floor . “
97804	97805	97801	97801	You	560	” “
97810	97867	97801	97801	You	560	” I asked , sitting perfectly still in my seat , rejecting any sentiment that stemmed from Troy looking royally and thoroughly pissed at me . This was a first . We ’d had our arguments before , of course we had , but we always ended up seeing eye to eye . Not this time . “
97903	98159	98160	98160	Busted	347	” He stared at me with a look of complete disbelief . Despite myself , I felt my stomach roiling , turning over and over , like it was folding into a small origami square . He offered me a noncommittal grunt and dashed away , leaving the faint scent of his cologne and a hell of a headline on the newspaper . I turned my attention back to the Excel sheet , noticing , for the first time , a company trip to the Maldives I could use to max out the expenses proportion . An easy eight - hundred - thousand - dollar hole in the budget to throw the IRS off . I started making the necessary moves . Gerald would pay for what he did with his blood . Even if it cost me my relationship with my adoptive father . After working into the wee hours , I stopped by the card rooms again , checking on the tables , making sure we were making killer profits before locking up my office door . The night turned from black to blue by the time I made my way to my ( newly fixed ) Porsche . I unlocked the doors and put my hand on the handle when the cold barrel of a gun dug between my shoulder blades , biting into my skin . The voice that came after it was unmistakable . I would recognize it anywhere because I ’d spent nearly a decade listening to it wail . “
98164	98167	98160	98160	Busted	347	” Gerald . “
98186	98210	98178	98178	I	140	” he instructed , his voice and the gun quaking with both adrenaline and fear . I lifted my hands haphazardly , smirking . “
98223	98224	98221	98221	Gerry	754	” “
98231	98240	98244	98244	Gerald	754	” He dug the metal into my skin . “
98279	98280	98270	98270	I	140	” “
98285	98289	98281	98281	You	2286	” I deadpanned . “
98332	98501	98507	98507	Gerry	754	” I slid into the Porsche calmly , not breaking a sweat . My fear of being shot by him was somewhere below zero . Firstly , because I did n’t think he had the guts to pull the trigger , and , secondly , because even if he did shoot , which was unlikely , he would miss . He did n’t have a steady hand , and all I needed was one small error to snatch the gun from between his sweaty fingers . Thirdly , and most importantly , I did n’t care if I died . I never was much of a fan of living in the first place . I enjoyed very few things , and one of them was Gerald ’s daughter , who did not want anything to do with me anymore . My fault , of course , for pushing her away , knowing beyond reasonable doubt that her family would never let her flaunt the help in high society . “
98563	98585	98543	98543	I	140	” I said , my voice soaked with amusement . It was high time we had a conversation about what mattered . “
98592	98596	98597	98597	You	754	” he stuttered . “
98606	98719	98604	98604	I	140	” I had no interest in letting him finish that sentence . I turned around quickly , elbowing the gun and sending it careening across the road . Gerald let out a high - pitched moan of surprise , making a beeline to seize it , squatting down to the ground . I was taller , leaner , and faster . I sauntered my way to him as he bent down to take the weapon , pressed my loafer onto his hand — breaking a few small bones in the process , no doubt — just as his fingers curled around the base of the gun . I smacked my lips together . “
98730	98731	98604	98604	I	140	” “
98741	98809	98736	98736	I	140	” He wiggled under my foot desperately . I grabbed him by the shirt , dragging him toward my car as he kicked and grunted in annoyance , pocketing his gun after checking if it was cocked ( shocker : it was not ) . I hurled Gerald inside and slammed the door , getting into the driver ’s seat next to him and starting the car . “
98813	98817	98736	98736	I	140	” I grumbled . “
98835	98967	98823	98823	Hunter	615	” I nodded , noticing that he shook beside me . Unbelievable . I put his daughter through so much shit , and she always gave me one hell of a fight . But this guy , he could n’t even sit still without wanting to piss his pants . I did n’t know where Aisling got her strength , but it sure was n’t from her fucking parents . When we got to the penthouse and Gerald pushed the door open and started his verbal diarrhea , I pressed my finger to my mouth then started looking around the living room to see if it was bugged . As far as I could tell , it was n’t . I sat at the dining table , smiling sardonically at him . “
98978	99029	98976	98976	Gerry	754	” Gerald erected himself to his full height , jutting his chin out , trying to appear braver than he was . The weight loss made him slightly less deplorable physically , but I still knew that behind the exterior was a man who deserved a slow and painful death . “
99051	99066	99067	99067	You	2295	” Gerald boasted , still standing up , for some reason beyond my grasp . “
99071	99075	99067	99067	You	2295	” I yawned . “
99080	99097	99067	99067	You	2295	” Gerald leaned forward , pressing his fingers to the oak dining table as he spoke . “
99192	99193	99196	99196	Gerry	754	” “
99218	99236	99213	99213	My	140	” I looked around , wondering if he had any good coffee . He straightened his spine . “
99261	99262	99243	99243	She	463	” “
99268	99304	99305	99305	Plant	348	” I spat out , losing patience . The mention of her name made me nauseous . This was outrageous . I could n’t be nauseous . I was n’t a fucking damsel in distress . “
99381	99446	99354	99354	her	2299	” I stared at him , speechless . Aisling played me . And she fucking won , too . She loved me , yes , but not so much that she was blinded by my actions . Even more than her affections for me , she was loyal to her family , and hell if it did n’t make me miss her even more . “
99450	99510	99354	99354	her	2299	” I started . Gerald shook his head , walking over to the coffee table , picking up what looked to be today ’s newspaper , tossing it into my hands . I picked it up and glanced at the headline . Keaton Hints at Firing Clayborn After Elections : What ’s Next for the White House ? Motherfucker . “
99516	99593	99354	99354	her	2299	” I let the words churn in my mouth , deciding I fucking hated how they tasted . Gerald plopped down next to me , rubbing at his face tiredly as he reached for a whiskey with two tumblers at the center of the table , pouring us drinks . I took out a pack of cigarettes and lit one up , making myself comfortable . This bullshit was n’t going to be over anytime soon . “
99596	99610	99611	99611	I	140	” He nudged my drink in my direction , his fingers still trembling . “
99687	99721	99724	99725	Barbara McAllister	323	” Then Troy picked it up at the entrance to my club , on his way in , and showed it to me . Goddammit , Nix , you ’re a clever one . “
99805	99809	99810	99810	Aisling	463	” Gerald continued . “
99847	99848	99843	99843	She	323	” “
99860	99915	99858	99858	Ash	133	” It seemed like a sophisticated operation , and Gerald was only good for managing a company that ’d been handed to him by his own father . Even that , he half - assed . Cillian was a much better CEO than Gerald ever was , something Gerald secretly resented his son for . “
99943	99973	99974	99974	Aisling	463	” So hot . Though I doubted he ’d appreciate that specific input . Gerald took a sip of his drink , his shoulders rolling as he visibly relaxed . “
100110	100196	100197	100197	We	2315	” This was pretty much spot - on , so I could n’t dispute it . I played into Ash ’s hands , and even when we ’d met , even when I ’d been balls deep inside her , when she cried my name , when she told me she loved me , when she offered me herself on a silver platter , she still plotted against me . Tried to uncover the truth . Was an active participant in our mental chess game . “
100207	100342	100197	100197	We	2315	” I said tersely , trying to understand how they managed to cover the last part of their plan . This was why the headline made sense . Because Barbara told me she had taken one of the deals . That she was going to write the tell - all . The plan was to have Gerald beg me to step in . I , in turn , would have a confession from him , throw my weight a little around Barbara , pay her to keep her mouth shut , and the whole thing would be canceled . Then , depending on Gerald ’s version of what went down between him and Cat , I planned to shed some Fitzpatrick blood . Not a lot . Just enough to satisfy my bloodthirsty nature . “
100352	100358	100197	100197	We	2315	” Gerald shook his head . “
100372	100411	100412	100412	Aisling	463	” I could feel my face morph from anger to disgust . I was played not only by Ash , but by that airheaded Barbie . As if hearing my internal thoughts , Gerald offered a quick nod . “
100486	100532	100471	100471	You	2317	” That was true . The minute I hooked Barbara McAllister up with a so - called literary agent — who was probably Emmabelle , too — I stepped aside and tended to my own business , secure in the notion everything would run smoothly . “
100542	100577	100535	100535	Ash	133	” I narrowed my eyes at Gerald . Everything seemed too flawless to be done without any help . Gerald smiled a smile that sank into the pit of my fucking stomach . No . “
100580	100594	100595	100595	She	323	” Gerald replied , and I realized I said the word out loud . “
100614	100706	100611	100612	Troy Brennan	952	” For the first time in a long time , I had nothing to say . Nothing other than where the fuck was Aisling ? Why was n’t she the one confronting me ? Only the answer was obvious . She did n’t want anything to do with me . Every time we were alone , I ’d somehow find a way into her pants before pushing her away and telling both of us it would never happen again . Fucking pathetic . And this time I did n’t mean her . “
100795	100850	100770	100770	she	167	” Gerald continued , taking another generous sip of whiskey . I took a drag off my cigarette . My drink remained untouched . Through the curtains , the oranges and pinks of a winter sunrise colored the sky . I tapped my cigarette to the side of my lip , mulling it over . “
100855	100860	100770	100770	she	167	” I said eventually . “
100863	100867	100868	100868	Aisling	463	” Gerald agreed . “
100914	100924	100925	100925	We	2332	” She even used her weaknesses to her advantage . “
100929	100948	100925	100925	We	2332	” I bit out harshly , childishly , the need to fuck her over right back overwhelming me . “
100967	101126	100962	100964	this Barbara woman	2334	” I knew where she was going to be soon . Six feet under . Actually , that was n’t true . I was n’t going to kill Barbara , but not because she did n’t deserve it for double - crossing me . I was n’t going to kill her because it was obvious Aisling fucking Fitzpatrick was going to go after my ass , knowing I had one hell of a motive . It was n’t a cold day in Hell , but finally , I found someone who held me accountable for my actions . It was n’t the police , the sheriff , the FBI , or the mayor , although all of them had tried . It was a petite Irish girl with a smart mouth and eyes like bluebells who wanted to give me everything she had until I made it very clear to her I was n’t worth any of it . “
101133	101224	100962	100964	this Barbara woman	2334	” Gerald grinned smugly , his face so punchable I was surprised it did n’t curve inside out . He snapped his fingers , and just like that , Barbara materialized from the hallway , no longer looking like a day - shift stripper . Her hair was coiffed back , her attire a black velvet Prada suit and Chanel purse . Yeah , she definitely did n’t need any food stamps or half - finished cigarette packs . Barbara smiled at me apologetically , giving me a quick nod . “
101284	101326	101330	101330	madam	2337	” Only I could n’t . Because I did n’t have any real friends . Only people I had business with and met with socially — only to make sure they did n’t screw up any of our mutual business shit . “
101332	101371	101330	101330	madam	2337	” She smiled and dashed out the door after saying her goodbyes , leaving Gerald and me to face each other . I took out another cigarette , waiting for the question on the tip of his tongue . “
101384	101408	101376	101376	your	2335	” he asked quietly , dropping his elbows to his knees . He looked broken . Wilted and weak and somehow still angry . “
101458	101506	101507	101507	I	140	” Openly my ass . If he was so open about his business with me , he would n’t have forbade me from taking his daughter out for a coffee . Not that that was what I wanted . Or had anything to do with this bullshit . “
101512	101525	101526	101526	Catalina	102	” I said , flicking ash into an ashtray on the table . “
101589	101595	101569	101569	she	102	” I took a deep breath “
101643	101724	101725	101725	You	2345	” I said it three times , so he ’d understand I meant business . Gerald stared at me for a long beat . When he finally opened his mouth , no words came out . He started to laugh . Cackle was more like it . And I mean , really go at it , slapping his thigh as he tried to regulate his breath , wiping a tear from the corner of his eye , shaking his head . “
101730	101734	101739	101739	son	3063	” He heaved . “
101741	101742	101739	101739	son	3063	” “
101784	101826	101829	101829	I	140	” The pictures were genuine . They were real . And they were damning . I knew a photoshopped work when I saw it , and this was n’t it . So why was I feeling like an idiot right now ? “
101900	101947	101889	101889	I	140	” He looked away now , rubbing the back of his head . There was no well - mannered way to point out someone ’s mother was a whore , so I did n’t necessarily fault him for that . He carried on , exhaling quickly . “
102071	102072	102067	102069	OB - GYN	192	” “
102082	102083	102087	102087	she	2875	” “
102151	102160	102165	102165	she	2875	” I did not take that into consideration . “
102173	102191	102165	102165	she	2875	” I drawled , trying to keep my cool . He finished his whiskey in one go . “
102194	102195	102165	102165	she	2875	” “
102257	102275	102279	102279	Donnie	560	” Gerald stared at me through beady , liquid black eyes , his lips sneering in distaste . “
102284	102291	102279	102279	Donnie	560	” I shook my head slowly . “
102455	102514	102517	102517	Cat	97	” Suddenly , I had a really bad headache . Because through foggy memory , I did remember Donnie . A tall , blond fuckboy . I remembered internally referring to him as Captain Potato Head for having the combined IQ and wit of a used condom . He was the first person to give me a cigarette . “
102533	102567	102570	102570	boy	3063	” I did as I was told , mostly because I was too distracted to tell him to fuck off . The man left the pack open , jerking it in my direction . “
102584	102585	102575	102575	I	140	” “
102591	102592	102586	102586	I	140	” “
102617	102618	102586	102586	I	140	” “
102623	102681	102684	102684	Sam	560	” I turned to Gerald , the biting pain of being played closing in on my throat again . This time not by Aisling , who was at least smart and intelligent , but by Cat , whom I would n’t trust with a goddamn Snickers bar . All the pieces of the puzzle were falling together . “
102686	102716	102684	102684	Sam	560	” Gerald poured himself more whiskey , seeming more relaxed than he had in weeks . I knew he was telling the truth , and it fucking killed me . “
102976	102998	102999	102999	You	2379	” I began peeling the soft paper around the cigarette pack , feeling like a thirteen - year - old again . “
103010	103015	102999	102999	You	2379	” I said coldly . “
103126	103127	103128	103128	I	140	” “
103132	103136	103137	103137	I	140	” I hissed . “
103146	103147	103137	103137	I	140	” “
103154	103158	103161	103162	a kid	137	” Gerald emphasized . “
103292	103293	103278	103278	she	2391	” “
103305	103306	103278	103278	she	2391	” “
103313	103317	103310	103311	my fixer	2392	” Gerald corrected . “
103406	103469	103392	103392	you	2396	” There was silence . I knew more needed to be said , but I was n’t sure what . I believed Gerald , and that should have been enough . I should have felt some sort of relief or contentment with this information . Cautiously , Gerald continued , drawing a circle with his index finger around his tumbler of whiskey . “
103518	103746	103747	103747	You	2400	” And just like that , he hit the nail on the head . I created this mess . Troy was right . Gerald was right , too . I wanted it , needed it , manufactured it the day after I slept with Aisling to distract myself from the hard truths . Aisling Fitzpatrick could never be mine . She was too innocent , too precious , too blue - blooded for a man like me . I could n’t have her — and not just because her family paid me not to . The extra money did n’t matter much to me . But also because I could n’t give her all the things she needed — monogamy , a wedding , a family , children . And most importantly because I knew being with her would put her life at risk . She is already putting her life at risk , doing what she is doing . She could end up in jail tomorrow , which means you played savior Jesus for nothing . The truth hit me hard . I wanted Aisling Fitzpatrick . There were no more distractions . No more excuses . No more reasons to stay away . Especially now , when both Gerald and I had each other by the throat . It was time to make a bargain . “
103777	103791	103766	103766	I	140	” I sat back , nailing him to his seat with a stare . “
103883	103884	103869	103869	I	140	” “
103970	103979	103958	103958	I	140	” He groaned , rubbing his face tiredly . “
103987	103988	103989	103990	Your daughter	685	” “
103992	104022	103989	103990	Your daughter	685	” I replied simply . He laughed . This time it came out metallic and scratchy . His whole body rejected the idea . Like a failed organ transplant . “
104080	104089	104071	104071	I	140	” he flicked his wrist , checking his Rolex “
104115	104116	104103	104103	I	140	” “
104123	104127	104103	104103	I	140	” I clipped . “
104137	104138	104139	104139	My	140	” “
104142	104151	104139	104139	My	140	” he spat out , his eyes widening . “
104158	104159	104139	104139	My	140	” “
104165	104181	104139	104139	My	140	” I waved an impatient hand his way , standing up and collecting my things . “
104193	104214	104139	104139	My	140	” He shot up to his feet , jabbing a finger in the air in my direction . I shrugged . “
104229	104230	104223	104223	I	140	” “
104247	104259	104244	104245	my daughter	1057	” He paused , a flicker of interest crossing his face . “
104268	104269	104264	104264	you	2407	” “
104283	104284	104276	104277	Your daughter	1057	” “
104291	104296	104297	104297	Aisling	463	” he cried desperately . “
104312	104313	104310	104310	She	1057	” “
104327	104360	104310	104310	She	1057	” I cut him off , shouldering past him toward the bathroom , where I yanked his gun out of my pocket and wiped it clean of my fingerprints with a towel . “
104380	104381	104383	104383	you	2407	” “
104385	104395	104383	104383	you	2407	” He eyed me skeptically through the bathroom mirror . “
104403	104421	104383	104383	you	2407	” Yes . I wanted Aisling . I met his gaze head - on in the mirror . “
104443	104447	104441	104441	me	140	” I enunciated . “
104450	104473	104474	104474	She	1057	” He looked close to hitting me . It surprised and delighted me to know Gerald cared so much about his daughter . “
104481	104485	104474	104474	She	1057	” he hissed . “
104491	104497	104474	104474	She	1057	” I pretended to gag . “
104574	104575	104576	104576	I	140	” “
104582	104604	104576	104576	I	140	” I put his gun down on the sink ’s edge , turning around and folding my arms over my chest . “
104610	104611	104576	104576	I	140	” “
104667	104673	104674	104674	You	2875	” It seemed straightforward enough . “
104687	104695	104683	104685	My family heirloom	2419	” I gave him a curt nod . “
104699	104700	104683	104685	My family heirloom	2419	” “
104712	104735	104736	104736	I	140	” He did n’t finish the sentence , shaking his head to rid himself of whatever horrid image played in his mind . “
104743	104744	104736	104736	I	140	” “
104752	104787	104791	104791	he	2420	” I turned around and left him there . Now there was only one slight matter . The matter of making Aisling not hate me with a burning passion of a fucking million suns . “
104801	104820	104796	104796	we	2421	” My mother tore her croissant into miniscule pieces on her flowery plate , demolishing the poor pastry . “
104827	104961	104962	104962	Da	148	” I sat across the table from her , staring into my oatmeal like it had wronged me in some profound way . I did n’t want Athair to deal with Sam by himself , but he had insisted , and considering the fact he was the main victim of Sam ’s vicious plan — a plan that I followed closely without telling anyone from my family — I tended to agree with him . Besides , there was nothing I could possibly say to Sam that I had n’t already . I confessed my love to him , gave him my body , offered him my soul , sought him out over and over again . I needed to gather whatever was left of my pride and move on with my life . “
104967	104985	104962	104962	Da	148	” I said unconvincingly , taking a sip of my pulpy , freshly - squeezed orange juice . “
104992	104993	104962	104962	Da	148	” “
105000	105009	104996	104996	he	148	” Mother slapped a hand to her chest . “
105041	105042	105043	105044	Samuel Brennan	560	” “
105066	105196	105199	105199	Jane	2875	” Mother ’s fingers strummed over her Swarovski necklace , letting out something between a wail and a moan . The door behind my back swung open . I did n’t have to turn around to see who it was . My father stalked inside , his steps heavy and wobbly . It was the first time he ’d seen my mother in weeks . After my idea to set Barbara as a trap for Sam and put our plan into motion , I had gotten my parents to talk a little on the phone but could n’t get them to meet in person . They were both still wary of one another , even when I clearly established the only dirty player in this whole situation was Sam . “
105201	105344	105345	105345	You	2429	” Da stopped cold to take in my mother . They ’d both lost so much weight and vitality over the last weeks , it was almost like looking at their ghosts . It hit me like a brick just then . How love was like Lady Masquerade . It could take on many faces . My parents cheated on each other . They lied , backstabbed one another , and failed to communicate with each other . Still , they could n’t bear to be apart . They loved each other in their own backward way , and maybe love was n’t a beautiful thing , after all . Most things in life were n’t . Mother stood up . They both stared at each other , neither of them wanting to say anything to ruin this precious , fragile moment . “
105349	105365	105345	105345	You	2429	” Da said finally . Mother pressed her palm against her cheek , actually blushing . “
105376	105377	105378	105378	I	140	” “
105390	105391	105392	105392	I	140	” “
105395	105396	105392	105392	I	140	” “
105401	105421	105397	105397	I	140	” he said . She motioned to the dining table laden with pastries , oatmeal , and fresh fruit . “
105427	105428	105397	105397	I	140	” “
105436	105535	105397	105397	I	140	” He slipped into his usual seat , piling pastries onto a plate . I did n’t ask him how it went with Sam . His appetite alone told me everything I needed to know . My worst fears and suspicions about my personal monster had turned out to be true . He almost ruined my family . Almost , because I would n’t let him . But he ’d intended to do that nonetheless . I took another sip of my orange juice , studying Da . Finally , he whipped his head to look at me . “
105542	105558	105561	105561	him	2432	” He put a butter knife streaked with marmalade on the side of his plate . “
105576	105608	105572	105572	Barbara	323	” My heart hurt so much it felt like he ripped it straight out of my chest , breaking a few ribs in the process . Why , Sam , why ? “
105611	105627	105628	105628	I	140	” Mother asked tentatively , echoing my thoughts . Da turned to look at her . “
105671	105692	105693	105693	I	140	” Da turned back to me . Smiling and trying my best to appear calm , I waited for more . “
105769	105787	105767	105767	Sam	560	” he took a deep breath , as if he was about to rip a Band - Aid “
105855	106010	105842	105842	you	2432	” I waited to feel all the feelings I thought I ’d associate with this speech . Relief , happiness , and elation . But all I could feel was the bitter taste of irony exploding in my mouth . Because Da ’s acceptance of my relationship with Sam was too little too late . Sam would never be mine . He ’d made that perfectly clear . Even if he was open to some sort of a relationship , he would n’t offer me love , and I was n’t going to back down from my demand — it was all or nothing . Besides , what kind of woman was idiotic enough to be with a man who wished to see her family burn ? Standing up , I excused myself , curtsying like Ms. B had taught me , and gave them the one - on - one time they needed . “
106058	106194	106234	106234	girl	2438	” I grabbed my coat and dashed out to the freezing cold of winter . To the lonely arms of heartbreak . Later that evening , when I came back home , Sailor , Belle , and Persy were waiting for me in my room . They were wearing Christmas - themed pajamas . An unholy amount of takeout food and wine was sprawled on my bed , stinking up the place . Merde . Christmas was only a few days away . How did it slip my mind ? We had n’t made any plans together , so I was caught off - guard by the spontaneous meet - up , but after a long day at work , I could n’t exactly be mad at them for providing a much - needed distraction . “
106197	106231	106234	106234	girl	2438	” I dropped my backpack , scanning the three of them huddled in my bed like kids , watching It ’s a Wonderful Life , stuffing their faces with maple - covered popcorn . “
106240	106252	106254	106255	good spirits	2440	” Persy drummed chopsticks over takeout boxes , wiggling her brows . “
106257	106278	106254	106255	good spirits	2440	” Sailor added , showing me exactly what she meant by waving around a bottle of gin . I laughed . “
106283	106292	106254	106255	good spirits	2440	” Belle murmured around a mouthful of popcorn . “
106323	106405	106308	106309	These bitches	2441	” She tossed a matching pajama set my way , and I noticed there was a red lettering on the green PJ ’s : 69 % Nice . I scurried to the bathroom and enjoyed a quick but steaming hot shower . When I got out , they were already settling all the food on the floor , including plates and utensils . Belle cracked open a bottle of champagne , leaving the gin unopened behind her back . I frowned . “
106418	106481	106415	106416	Madame Mayhem	168	” Belle was the owner of a nightclub , much different than the one Sam was running . Recently , though , she wanted to sell it and soul - search across the globe . Travel . See things . Taste things . She always went against the grain , always did things her way — independently . Belle shook her head . “
106490	106491	106415	106416	Madame Mayhem	168	” “
106497	106556	106557	106557	I	140	” I looked between them . I had an inkling I was being ambushed , and after the morning I had today — after giving up on my dream of being with Sam once and for all — I was in no mood to receive a lecture . Belle sighed , tossing her blonde hair over one shoulder . “
106615	106620	106606	106606	you	2445	” she trailed off . “
106628	106716	106623	106623	Aisling	463	” Sailor said gravely . We had n’t exactly disappeared at the same time . Sam had tailed me without my knowledge . I blinked , waiting for the other shoe to drop . How much did they really know ? I was always careful not to tell my friends anything about what went on with Sam . I knew how unlikely it was that something real would grow out of it , and did n’t want to be judged . More than I already was anyway . “
106725	106730	106623	106623	Aisling	463	” Sailor said flatly . “
106777	106800	106765	106765	he	2448	” Touchy ? I wanted to laugh . Surely not . He did n’t care . He ’d made that abundantly clear . “
106803	106816	106817	106817	I	140	” I said flatly , relieved that they did n’t know more . “
106827	106828	106817	106817	I	140	” “
106833	106847	106817	106817	I	140	” Persy requested , patting a spot on the carpet next to her . “
106879	106884	106862	106862	God	115	” She sighed wistfully . “
106926	106951	106918	106918	he	560	” Belle pointed out , dumping a mass of noodles , beef , and vegetables onto a plate then handing it over to me . “
106985	106986	106968	106969	Sam Brennan	560	” “
106995	107048	106987	106987	We	2449	” Sailor bit her lower lip , looking downward at her food . I sank to the carpet next to Persy , my eyes drifting among all of them as the pit in my stomach grew deeper and darker , as if bracing myself for the pain that was about to come . “
107062	107114	106987	106987	We	2449	” Persy added , slurping a noodle between her pink Cupid lips . Oh , merde . I could n’t possibly handle any more bad news or sensational revelations today . Already , I felt like my heart was in my throat , ready to be puked out any minute now . “
107119	107123	106987	106987	We	2449	” I asked . “
107131	107144	106987	106987	We	2449	” Sailor cleared her throat , amending as she chewed on her broccoli “
107287	107448	107450	107450	I	140	” Sailor nibbled on the broccoli nervously . I did my best not to laugh at that . They had lengthy conversations about my obsession with Sam . Behind my back . I always knew that Sailor , Emmabelle , and Persephone were one unit , and I was an addition . A bonus epilogue to an already perfectly finished book . They ’d all met at elementary school , while I ’d been added to their girl - gang when I was seventeen . By then , they were best friends for a very long time and ticked off all the milestones together : first period , first kiss , first guy , first love , first heartbreak . Emmabelle and Persephone were sisters , with Belle being the oldest . And Sailor ? Sailor was like Persy ’s twin . They did n’t tell me about the pact because they did n’t think to include me in it . “
107458	107462	107452	107452	Sam	560	” Sailor continued , “
107550	107551	107556	107556	Sam	560	” “
107577	107606	107571	107571	Boasts	360	” Persy pointed out heatedly , and I knew their hearts were in the right place , but I so did n’t need to hear this right now . “
107614	107635	107636	107636	Honey	361	” I repeated again , dully though my body temperature climbed up steadily . They were patronizing me . Again . “
107656	107687	107636	107636	Honey	361	” Belle threw her arms around my shoulders , pressing me close in a hug . My plate nearly tipped over , some of its contents spilling on the carpet . “
107708	107709	107699	107699	You	361	” “
107717	107722	107723	107723	You	361	” Sailor smiled awkwardly . “
107729	107730	107723	107723	You	361	” “
107736	107746	107733	107733	I	140	” I bit out , pulling back from Belle . “
107783	107829	107762	107762	I	140	” Technically speaking , I was n’t . I had in the past , but I ended things , coming to the same conclusion they did — a decade after giving him my heart on a monster ride . Belle gave me a pitying look . “
107834	107854	107762	107762	I	140	” That was it . I snapped . Jumped to my feet , sending my plate in the air . “
107882	107896	107897	107897	I	140	” I laughed incredulously , my teeth clenching with anger . Sailor winced . “
107905	107939	107897	107897	I	140	” I squeezed the bridge of my nose , willing myself to take a big , cleansing breath . In . Out . That ’s it . Nope . It did n’t work . “
107956	107969	107954	107954	we	2461	” I opened my arms theatrically , making a show of it . “
108068	108099	108066	108066	you	361	” I turned to Persy , who shrank into herself visibly . She was the least judgmental out of my friends , but she was n’t lily white or guiltless . “
108182	108223	108180	108180	Belle	167	” I turned to Belle , smiling at her sweetly . Out of all of our friends , Belle and I were the most unlikely pair and also the closest . Probably because we were the only two still single . “
108322	108358	108359	108359	I	140	” By the time I was done , I was panting and sweating under the flannel pajamas . I lost all appetite for the takeout , and even the Christmas movie binge session seemed unappealing . “
108367	108383	108359	108359	I	140	” I folded my arms over my chest , shifting my weight from foot to foot “
108387	108409	108410	108410	You	2474	” Persy was the first to oblige . She smoothed her jammies , her eyes filled to the brim with tears . “
108414	108418	108410	108410	You	2474	” she whispered . “
108450	108474	108440	108440	we	2475	” She looked around for support and found it from Sailor and Belle , who nodded , shuffling up to their feet also . “
108489	108522	108475	108477	Reforming bad men	2476	” Sailor smiled crookedly , and in that moment , I could swear that even though they did n’t share DNA , she was all Sam . Same mannerisms and lopsided smile . “
108537	108538	108539	108539	You	2474	” “
108547	108556	108539	108539	You	2474	” Belle rolled her eyes with a huff . “
108615	108616	108593	108594	that man	2063	” “
108623	108628	108593	108594	that man	2063	” Sailor said tentatively . “
108670	108699	108700	108700	I	140	” I smiled softly , feeling like a stone had been lifted from my heart , and it was my friends that had pushed it off through teamwork . “
108708	108806	108700	108700	I	140	” And just like that , I knew I would no longer get shit for whatever happened or did n’t happen with Sam . The Brennans and the Fitzpatricks did not celebrate Christmas together that year for the first time in a decade . Sailor elegantly addressed the subject after Jane and Gerald ’s invitation arrived at her house , excluding Troy ’s , Sparrow ’s , and my name . It was during Christmas dinner , with Hunter looking so emo he gave that asshole from Panic ! At The Disco a run for his money . “
108818	108849	108815	108816	A fuckboy	2481	” Sailor shot poisonous arrows across the table with her moss - green eyes . Entirely unwilling to discuss the subject publicly , I shoved lukewarm yams into my mouth . “
108868	108869	108855	108855	I	140	” “
108883	108894	108876	108877	my family	610	” Hunter stated the fucking obvious , as per usual . “
108907	108908	108897	108897	I	140	” “
108927	109557	108918	108919	No one	836	” Troy said matter - of - factly , though I knew he was still pissed with me for screwing up the entire Gerald operation . I ’d given Nix a few days to come to terms with what had happened between her father and me , letting her cool down . She was upset . That was a given . But she would get over it . I imagined her overcome with joy as I told her I ’d come to terms with the idea of being with her . Tonight , I had every intention of putting an end to this nonsense and claim her . As the evening unfolded , and Hunter hit the eggnog like it was vintage whiskey while Sailor watched over her kids to ensure none of them caught on fire , and Troy and Sparrow looked ready to undress each other , I took my cue and said my goodbyes . Rather than drive back to my apartment , I headed straight to Avebury Court Manor . I was n’t so dumb as to think Gerald and Jane Fitzpatrick would share their daughter ’s enthusiasm at seeing me on their doorstep . That suited me just fine . I was more than capable of climbing into windows , which according to all the movies and shows I had definitely not watched with Sailor and Sparrow , it was deemed hopelessly romantic . Nix was a romantic . I was in the best shape of my life . It was a no - fucking - brainer . Parking in front of the mansion , I noticed the lights were already out . The Fitzpatricks wrapped up Christmas early . I rounded their house , detecting Nix ’s window . The light was turned off there , too . Breaking into her room was like taking candy from a baby . Avebury Court Manor was built low and spread out rather than tall and narrow . And there were columns fucking everywhere . The snow was not ideal . Then again , I ’d managed climbing my way into places in worse conditions . I threw a rope over the bannister between her window and one of the columns , and when it fell back through the other side , I tied a tight knot , tugging at it to ensure it was firm before ascending up the column while holding onto the rope , rock - climbing style . When I reached her window , I knocked on it a few times , peering in through the double - glazed glass . She was sound asleep , unmoving in her bed , her midnight hair fanned across her shoulders and face . A dark angel . I rapped the window again , watching as she stirred awake , her eyelashes fluttering before swinging her long , lean legs over the bed and walking over toward her door . For the third time , I banged on the window , exasperated . Pretty sure Romeo did n’t have to deal with a woman who had the hearing of a fucking air fryer . She jumped in surprise , turning around , her eyes meeting mine from across the room . When the sight of me registered , she ran toward the window . Atta girl . Nix was coming back to the arms of her favorite monster . She unlatched the window open , and in one swift movement put her hands on my shoulders and pushed me with all her power , sending me flying back down . Quick on my feet , I grabbed onto the gutter , hanging onto it for dear fucking life , my legs swinging in the air . “
109583	109584	109578	109578	I	140	” “
109590	109618	109578	109578	I	140	” she spat out from somewhere above my head , sounding … well , not half as glad as I thought she ’d be to see me . “
109629	109702	109627	109627	Brennan	952	” Luckily , I put a lot of effort into ensuring my upper body was strong and did suspension exercises and pull - ups with Mitchell four times a week , so I knew that as long as the gutter was n’t going to split in two , I could hang on it for a while . Of course , I might lose my fingers in the process because of fucking frostbite . “
109726	109755	109756	109756	You	2484	” I was fucking obsessed with her . It made no sense at all . You were not supposed to crave what was offered to you in abundance . “
109796	109804	109810	109810	Nix	140	” When she put it that way … “
109828	109829	109812	109812	I	140	” “
109872	109873	109874	109874	I	140	” “
109880	109975	109874	109874	I	140	” I grunted , pulling myself up and settling on the roof outside her window like a goddamn dog since she would n’t let me in . Aisling crossed her arms , arching an eyebrow . She wore horrible flannel pajamas with ferrets on them . I knew she used to have a ferret — Shelly — and wondered how the fuck I ended up being consumed by a woman who , despite her declarations of love for me , never tried to change her quirky weirdness to fit the mold and please me . “
109983	109988	109874	109874	I	140	” She clapped sarcastically . “
109999	110000	110001	110002	Your father	496	” “
110011	110012	110001	110002	Your father	496	” “
110022	110026	110029	110029	she	1685	” she drawled . “
110040	110062	110029	110029	she	1685	” Ignoring her snark , I trudged through with the story that was frankly beginning to bore even me to death . “
110077	110078	110072	110072	I	140	” “
110095	110099	110084	110084	I	140	” she added , “
110103	110116	110117	110117	I	140	” I ground my teeth together , trying to keep my cool . “
110186	110231	110233	110233	we	2496	” That stopped her from unleashing another unhelpful remark my way . Aisling ’s already milky skin paled further . She stepped back , biting her lip to prevent her mouth from falling in shock . I raised a hand , shaking my head . “
110235	110240	110233	110233	we	2496	” she cleared her throat “
110244	110259	110233	110233	we	2496	” I was very close to falling from her roof and breaking my spine . “
110331	110332	110333	110333	You	140	” “
110339	110344	110333	110333	You	140	” she said finally . “
110351	110355	110347	110347	I	140	” I groaned . “
110397	110398	110390	110390	my	140	” “
110405	110406	110390	110390	my	140	” “
110462	110544	110454	110454	I	140	” She pursed her full lips in dissatisfaction , and again I hated myself for taking her for granted all these years . Even when I did n’t touch her , I knew she was there , waiting for me , fantasizing about me . It was almost as good as having her . Knowing that I could . Now , she looked like she wanted to finish the job the Bratva started that night she ran away from the cabin . “
110548	110552	110553	110553	I	140	” she asked . “
110565	110566	110553	110553	I	140	” “
110591	110595	110596	110596	I	140	” I chuckled . “
110603	110604	110596	110596	I	140	” “
110612	110617	110605	110605	You	140	” she repeated flatly . “
110645	110646	110647	110647	I	140	” “
110732	110782	110725	110725	I	140	” She did n’t want me . I had never taken a scenario like this into consideration . Nix ’s love was always in the background for me . Available and ready whenever I was . Now , I ’d fucked up and needed to deal with the consequences . “
110797	110804	110725	110725	I	140	” I warned , meaning it . “
110835	110849	110828	110828	you	140	” Feeling my jaw ticking with annoyance , I took a deep breath . “
110859	110860	110855	110855	I	140	” “
110868	110872	110861	110861	You	140	” she corrected . “
110878	110884	110873	110873	I	140	” I reminded her quietly . “
110968	111015	110955	110955	Brennan	952	” Dumbfounded , I stared at her , waiting for … what exactly ? Her to change her mind ? She was n’t going to . She wanted a fucking fairy tale , and so far I gave her a nightmare with a side of betrayal . “
111019	111024	111025	111025	Nix	140	” she said primly . “
111027	111363	111025	111025	Nix	140	” She slammed her window in my face , drawing the curtains shut for good measure . She kicked me out . Made new rules for our game . Now I needed to play by them or admit defeat . The first thing I did when I got back to my apartment was fling the pantry door open , nearly sending it off its hinges . There was n’t much food there . And by ‘ much ’ I meant at all . There was n’t any food there period . Only packs upon packs of Marlboros imported from Europe , because American cigarettes tasted like farts on fire . I stared at the piles upon piles of what Aisling had referred to as cancer sticks , wondering if I was really about to do what I was about to do . I was . Fuck it . I took six bullets in my lifetime . I could do this . I grabbed all the packs and shoved them into four recycling bags , including the pack that was in my pocket , and tossed everything into the building ’s dumpster . Then I went back upstairs and stared at the empty ashtray on my coffee table . Proving to Aisling that I took her seriously just might turn into my idea of a nightmare . And so help me God , she better come around fucking quickly or heads were going to roll on the streets of Boston . My phone started ringing in my skirt ’s pocket while I hugged Mrs. Martinez goodbye at the clinic door . Tugging it out , I was surprised to see Sam ’s name flashing on the screen . I had saved his number that time he came in with his injured soldiers just in case but never expected him to call me . I drew a firm line between optimism and stupidity , and that seemed like the threshold for it . What did he want ? “
111367	111479	111025	111025	Nix	140	” Mrs. Martinez ’s face clouded as she drank in my expression . Her hair had begun to grow again , fluffy and strewn about her head like little clouds now that she ’d stopped her chemotherapy treatments . She was feeling better . Sometimes it worked that way after chemo . She opted to stop because her doctor had told her there was no hope for remission . But we now had new hope . She was taking an experimental drug that was supposed to shrink the tumor on her pancreas . I was feeling hopeful she could live a comfortable life for months , maybe even a couple years . “
111482	111498	111025	111025	Nix	140	” I smiled brightly , nodding as I all but pushed her out the door . “
111512	111513	111514	111514	You	3115	” “
111517	111530	111514	111514	You	3115	” She stopped , digging her heels into the floor , grinning . “
111546	111578	111543	111544	Dr. F	366	” I had n’t given any of my patients my real full name . I needed to take safety measures to ensure my tracks were covered in case things went south . “
111583	111595	111543	111544	Dr. F	366	” My fingers tightened around my phone , which kept buzzing . “
111605	111606	111601	111601	I	140	” “
111609	111614	111601	111601	I	140	” She looked thoughtful . “
111631	111636	111625	111625	You	3115	” Mrs. Martinez winked . “
111644	111645	111646	111646	You	3115	” “
111649	111672	111646	111646	You	3115	” I asked , my smile thin and distracted . Please , lady , let me answer this . She nodded enthusiastically . “
111706	111726	111697	111697	They	2511	” Aquila Festival was where the most monumental part of my life had happened . Where I met Sam . “
111754	111759	111748	111750	William ’s babies	2512	” her chest puffed proudly “
111790	111815	111780	111788	the person who tried to call you right now	2513	” She jerked her chin to the phone I was clutching . I dropped my eyes to it and realized I missed the call . “
111820	111832	111833	111833	He	2513	” Mrs. Martinez rose on her tiptoes , kissing my cheek . “
111848	111893	111838	111838	He	2513	” I closed the door after her , frowning at my phone , willing it to ring again . Sure enough , it did . He has something important to tell you . Swiping a finger across the screen , I received the call . “
111899	111916	111917	111917	You	3115	” I put on the most bored tone I could find in my arsenal of voices . “
111942	111963	111939	111939	Sam	560	” he said darkly . I did not reply . Responding to his banter would suggest I ’d forgiven him . “
111969	111976	111964	111964	I	140	” he said after a beat . “
112011	112037	111996	111996	I	140	” I ambled back into my office , pinning the phone between my ear and shoulder as I scrubbed my hands clean in the sink . “
112063	112064	112052	112053	Russian kid	2514	” “
112067	112115	112118	112118	he	2514	” I said immediately . Of course I remembered him . He haunted me in my dreams . The liquid fear in his eyes . The way he shook and begged for his life . The pain Sam had inflicted on him when he shot his arm . “
112155	112173	112146	112146	he	2514	” Sam delivered the information blandly , like he was reading me food options from a menu . “
112178	112182	112183	112183	We	2518	” I ordered . “
112194	112478	112183	112183	We	2518	” he said and hung up . I prepared the examination table for the new patient as I mulled over how odd Sam was . He ’d promised he would court me on Christmas , and I suppose he did , in his own way . He sent me flowers yesterday with a simple unsigned note bearing his name , and a piece of jewelry , I suppose as a late Christmas gift . But he did n’t cower or beg . Did n’t come knocking on my door . He was n’t exactly chasing me . More like speed - walking while taking frequent water breaks . He still had a long way to go . But he was still in training . A few moments later , there was a knock on the door . I opened it , finding Sam and the Russian kid leaning against the gigantic man I hated to love . I slanted my head toward my office . Sam followed me , dragging the tall , scrawny boy along . I tried to ignore the acute beauty of my favorite monster . How tall and strong and corded with muscles he was . The deep tan of his skin and those full - moon eyes that always looked tranquil and cold , like a crisp December night . There was something else about him I found attractive today , but I could n’t put my finger on it . Something had changed , even if it was subtle . Sam unloaded the gangly kid onto the examination table , and I took scissors to the boy ’s shirt and started cutting it off of his chest . “
112484	112491	112492	112492	Ruslan	368	” I smiled at the boy . “
112494	112510	112492	112492	Ruslan	368	” he breathed , wincing as he spoke , wetting his lips with his tongue . “
112514	112515	112511	112512	Ruslan Kozlov	368	” “
112524	112525	112521	112522	Ruslan Kozlov	368	” “
112528	112564	112521	112522	Ruslan Kozlov	368	” His teeth chattered , and a few acne zits were gushing blood , probably from the stress . He was as pale as snow , and I knew he needed a blood transfusion fast . “
112571	112647	112521	112522	Ruslan Kozlov	368	” I murmured , keeping calm as I put on latex gloves . He did . It was one of Sam ’s soldiers who had shot him in Bratva territory — or what used to be their territory before Sam butted in . Ruslan was running errands for Vasily Mikhailov , whom I gathered was the local underboss . Sam came in with his entourage to threaten Vasily , and things got out of control . “
112658	112662	112652	112652	Vasily	1709	” I frowned . “
112672	112677	112652	112652	Vasily	1709	” The boy smiled . “
112700	112864	112694	112694	He	1709	” Something warm flooded my chest . I tried telling myself it meant nothing . Luckily , Ruslan knew his blood type , so I was able to call a friend of mine from med school who worked at the hospital and sometimes — on the rare occasion I asked him — provided me with blood units for transfusion . I sent Sam to pick it up with a cooler I had stashed in the clinic while I stayed and tended to Ruslan . When Sam came back with the blood donation , he wanted to hang around in the room , but I barked at him to leave . After I took care of Ruslan ’s wound , I put him on sedatives and took off my gloves , joining Sam in the waiting room . He was sitting on the couch , messing with his phone and hair at the same time . He stood up alertly the minute I appeared . “
112870	112883	112865	112865	He	2524	” I tried smoothing my hair into something that resembled a ponytail . “
112894	112920	112884	112884	I	140	” He stared at me quietly , like he was looking at me for the first time . The heat flooding my cheeks was unbearable . “
112926	112931	112884	112884	I	140	” he said suddenly . “
112934	112942	112884	112884	I	140	” My breath caught in my throat . “
112959	112960	112949	112949	We	2525	” “
112964	112975	112949	112949	We	2525	” He spat out the word like it was dirty . “
113022	113023	113015	113015	I	140	” “
113042	113052	113024	113024	You	2527	” I announced , giving him the stink eye . “
113062	113063	113024	113024	You	2527	” “
113066	113070	113024	113024	You	2527	” he demanded . “
113146	113191	113134	113134	You	2527	” Welcome ? He was now taking credit for the fact my father moved back into Avebury Court Manor and both my parents attended therapy together ? Unreal . I took a step back , staring at him like he was a complete loon . “
113212	113213	113134	113134	You	2527	” “
113226	113227	113134	113134	You	2527	” “
113230	113234	113134	113134	You	2527	” I hissed , “
113252	113253	113254	113254	You	2527	” “
113264	113268	113269	113269	I	140	” he quipped . “
113274	113275	113276	113276	I	140	” “
113282	113283	113276	113276	I	140	” “
113311	113312	113313	113313	You	2534	” “
113321	113349	113352	113352	Nix	140	” I folded my arms over my chest . He took a step forward , crowding me as he brushed a fly - away from my cheek . “
113370	113371	113367	113367	I	140	” “
113378	113382	113367	113367	I	140	” He smiled . “
113422	113426	113413	113413	I.	2538	” I gasped . “
113437	113438	113433	113433	I	140	” “
113455	113478	113479	113479	You	2534	” he replied , his breath fanning across my face , making every cell in my body tingle with need and anticipation . “
113486	113509	113479	113479	You	2534	” I informed him . He leaned forward , saying the words as his lips traced mine , speaking into my mouth . “
113527	113528	113519	113519	I	140	” “
113534	113550	113519	113519	I	140	” I was starting to feel it . The way I liquefied in his arms . “
113560	113561	113519	113519	I	140	” “
113570	113648	113562	113562	I	140	” His tongue glided between my lips , prying them open as he kissed me deeply . I let him , despite my inhibitions , and my better judgment , and the fact that I knew this was the opposite of what I was trying to do . I became lax in his arms , enjoying the steadiness of him as his tongue rolled around mine . His fingers dug into my skull , gripping my hair . “
113771	113772	113774	113774	you	140	” “
113781	113794	113774	113774	you	140	” I put a hand on his chest , pushing him away . “
113797	113801	113774	113774	you	140	” He grinned . “
113853	113854	113855	113855	Your	1940	” “
113858	113862	113855	113855	Your	1940	” I frowned . “
113867	113868	113869	113869	I	140	” “
113873	113885	113886	113886	You	1940	” He arched an eyebrow , looking more annoyed than gloating . “
113889	113900	113886	113886	You	1940	” My heart did a weird flip in my chest . “
113903	113904	113886	113886	You	1940	” “
113926	113927	113928	113928	You	1940	” “
113944	113945	113928	113928	You	1940	” “
113980	114033	113969	113969	I	140	” He said all the right things , and did all the right things , and still , I could n’t forgive him . Not now . Not yet . Not when I knew that he was so close to destroying my family . I took a step back , sobering up . “
114041	114068	113969	113969	I	140	” I asked . The change of topic seemed to have thrown him off , too , because he cocked his head , examining me coldly . “
114073	114074	113969	113969	I	140	” “
114078	114085	114086	114086	Nix	140	” I tilted my chin up . “
114088	114097	114086	114086	Nix	140	” he said darkly , narrowing his eyes . “
114117	114118	114121	114121	you	140	” “
114124	114129	114121	114121	you	140	” I said airily . “
114161	114171	114153	114153	them	474	” He considered my words , his face twisting . “
114175	114181	114153	114153	them	474	” I rolled my eyes . “
114184	114185	114153	114153	them	474	” “
114191	114192	114153	114153	them	474	” “
114200	114208	114209	114209	We	2550	” I could n’t help but grin . “
114212	114217	114209	114209	We	2550	” he said dryly . “
114245	114323	114233	114233	I	140	” He leaned down , kissed me hard , turned around , and walked away . It was only when he was gone that I realized the bastard had managed to snatch a piece of my heart in his fist yet again . Thief . Sam picked me up on New Year ’s Eve , wearing a full - blown tux and a solemn scowl that suggested Satan himself had blackmailed him into doing this at gunpoint . “
114327	114385	114387	114387	you	2553	” He shoved a bouquet of flowers into my hands when I opened the door , all dolled up in a sheer white mini - dress paired with Louboutin boots . They were a mix of lilies , sunflowers , and roses , in all shades and colors . I pressed them to my nose and grinned . “
114396	114397	114387	114387	you	2553	” “
114403	114414	114387	114387	you	2553	” He groaned , still obviously struggling with nicotine withdrawal . “
114423	114424	114415	114415	They	2554	” “
114429	114437	114415	114415	They	2554	” I answered with a small smile . “
114447	114492	114495	114495	her	2281	” I let him into the foyer and went to the kitchen to find a vase . When I rounded the corner to come back to the hallway , I stopped dead in my tracks at the sound of my father and Sam speaking . “
114525	114562	114521	114521	She	2281	” I heard Athair say . Merde . Sam was bound to say something provocative and crass just to piss Da off . That was the way he operated . To my surprise , Sam replied , “
114631	114632	114625	114625	she	2281	” “
114639	114643	114625	114625	she	2281	” Da said . “
114674	114699	114662	114662	Hunter	615	” Da was n’t wrong . I did have a bit more free time , but Mother still had a long way to go . “
114714	114753	114706	114706	she	2281	” Sam put a lid on the conversation , firm but not crass . I cleared my throat , stepping from the kitchen and making myself known . Both men froze . Sam ’s eyes landed on me . “
114758	114780	114706	114706	she	2281	” he asked . I nodded , my heart missing a beat again to the sight of him in a tux . “
114800	114801	114802	114802	You	560	” “
114807	114872	114802	114802	You	560	” I sat in his car , speechless and dumbfounded . Sam threw the Porsche into park and got out . Fifty minutes after he picked me up , we were at Canobie Lake Park , the closest serious amusement park to Boston . Sam rounded the car and opened the door for me . I stepped out , wrapping my coat around me . “
114878	114882	114883	114883	I	140	” I complained . “
114891	114904	114883	114883	I	140	” He tugged at my hand , leading me to the entrance . “
114912	114916	114917	114917	You	140	” I grumbled . “
114921	114926	114917	114917	You	140	” he said flatly . “
114933	114951	114929	114929	I	140	” He walked right into the open gate , not bothering with purchasing tickets at the cashier . “
114957	114976	114929	114929	I	140	” I blinked . Sam scanned the park around us absentmindedly , not bothering to look remotely surprised . “
115019	115020	115013	115017	too many people around us	2561	” “
115025	115048	115013	115017	too many people around us	2561	” I turned to look at him , my heart twisting in my chest . He chucked my chin with a smile . “
115057	115058	115013	115017	too many people around us	2561	” “
115067	115073	115013	115017	too many people around us	2561	” I cleared my throat . “
115089	115123	115126	115126	Sam	560	” That was n’t true . Even though I came from money , I never enjoyed it quite as much as people thought I did , and that made me even more emotional . “
115128	115201	115126	115126	Sam	560	” I looked away , so he could n’t see how deeply I blushed . Ten years ago , I came to a fair all by myself , lonely , lost , and sad . Now , I was at a theme park with the man I fell in love with by my side . He wanted me to have a do - over . A different spin on the monster ride . “
115218	115256	115210	115210	I	140	” I grinned , taking a step back from him , because yet again it was hard not to jump his bones when he was being sweet — or at least not a full - blown asshole . “
115283	115297	115278	115278	you	560	” We stared at each other , smirking . My reply was immediate . “
115308	115309	115278	115278	you	560	” “
115316	115320	115321	115321	Mine	74	” he said . “
115328	115405	115406	115406	He	74	” I murmured , taking his outstretched hand . He led the way . We boarded a train resembling a mine cart . I knew the ride was themed around a fictional mine that was about to collapse . The teenager who manned the ride approached us to check we were secure in our seats , grinning at Sam and offering him a fist bump that remained unanswered in the air . I rolled my eyes . “
115411	115412	115413	115413	He	74	” “
115431	115492	115413	115413	He	74	” The ride started and Sam ’s hand , which I did n’t even notice was resting on my knee , slid up my thigh , making my dress hike up to my waist . His face was still turned to the other side . To the miners and monsters around us . The story of the collapsing mine unfolded . “
115495	115510	115413	115413	He	74	” Sam asked , his fingers biting into my thighs , skimming my underwear . “
115514	115518	115413	115413	He	74	” I swallowed . “
115562	115607	115553	115553	You	2566	” I gave it some thought , even though his fingers pushing my underwear sideways , dipping into my wet core , made me shudder and lose my train of thought . I started breathing hard , feeling my nipples puckering under my bra . “
115610	115616	115553	115553	You	2566	” I heard myself say . “
115677	115687	115690	115690	she	2570	” I turned quiet for a second then said , “
115710	115779	115690	115690	she	2570	” My underlying question had nothing to do with Catalina . What I wanted to know was — would he ever be able to love a woman ? Sam ’s finger curled inside me , pushing in deeper and harder and faster . I began to pant . He turned his head toward me , his mouth finding mine in the dark , slanting over my lips possessively . “
115840	115906	115836	115836	she	211	” I moaned into his kiss , half - laughing , half - groaning , clutching him close as the ride drew to an end , spinning and sliding from here to there . The only people in the world were me and him . My orgasm was within reach . I could feel my body humming to the rhythm of his fingers inside me . “
115912	115919	115907	115907	I	140	” I croaked into his mouth . “
115935	115936	115931	115931	You	2574	” “
115940	115979	115937	115937	I	140	” he grunted , letting me ride his whole hand now beneath my dress . My hips bucked toward his arm , and I thrust and moaned shamelessly , the climax taking over my body like a tsunami . “
115986	116205	115984	115984	Monster	441	” I chanted , breathing his nickname in , thinking how he was right all those years ago , when I asked him what his name was . It was always Monster . And I was his Nix . Maybe it was the best night of my life . The thing about magical moments is that they wrap around you like a cloak , shielding you from reality , numbing your senses . But it felt like everything was illuminated . The air was fresher , my lungs fuller , and my skin tingled with adrenaline and warmth . From the junk food we consumed — sweet and salty popcorn , candy apples , and hot spiked ciders — and the rides . Ten seconds before midnight , we made our own countdown and kissed on the merry - go - round , each of us sitting on top of a unicorn . By the time we left the amusement park , it was half past two in the morning , and I knew I was going to hate both myself and Sam when I woke up in a few hours for another grueling shift at Dr. Doyle ’s clinic . I buckled up next to Sam in the car , still riding the high of the evening . “
116213	116252	116254	116254	me	140	” he said out of nowhere , starting the car . I whipped my head in his direction , my mouth going dry . It was like he threw a bucket full of ice water on my face . “
116256	116257	116258	116258	You	2575	” “
116273	116290	116258	116258	You	2575	” He kicked the vehicle into drive , his eyes cool and disciplined on the road . “
116316	116317	116304	116304	I	140	” “
116330	116335	116304	116304	I	140	” I reminded him . “
116410	116411	116397	116397	I	140	” “
116429	116470	116472	116472	I	140	” I trained my voice to sound blasé , keeping my raging emotions out of it . I had to remind myself he was trying to protect me , even if he had a weird way of going about it . “
116522	116523	116510	116510	I	140	” “
116532	116575	116510	116510	I	140	” he hissed , trying to keep himself in check . I knew Sam was n’t well - versed in negotiations . He normally just took what he wanted , when he wanted it . He was trying to make an effort . “
116583	116633	116510	116510	I	140	” I argued . We slid onto the highway . December gave way to January . It seemed like everything in the world — the trees , the roads , the buildings — was coated with a thin layer of crystal - blue frost , including Sam ’s heart . “
116660	116661	116510	116510	I	140	” “
116671	116679	116510	116510	I	140	” I turned to look at him . “
116701	116702	116703	116703	You	2581	” “
116707	116715	116703	116703	You	2581	” I chewed on my lower lip . “
116723	116724	116717	116717	I	140	” “
116734	116738	116739	116739	We	2583	” he grunted . “
116757	116811	116746	116746	sweetheart	140	” There was a we ? Since when was there a we ? And why did it make my heart squeeze inside my chest ? Because you still love him , mon cheri . You ’ve always loved him . He is your forever , even if you are only his right now . “
116814	116819	116746	116746	sweetheart	140	” I feigned innocence . “
116856	116857	116858	116858	You	2581	” “
116863	116864	116858	116858	You	2581	” “
116868	116880	116858	116858	You	2581	” I grinned , pleased with myself for holding my own . “
116892	116908	116858	116858	You	2581	” Sam explained , letting another verbal attack from my end roll off his back . “
116916	116924	116858	116858	You	2581	” I gave him a sidelong glance . “
116931	116936	116858	116858	You	2581	” I added quietly . “
116942	116950	116951	116951	You	2581	” he snapped , disgusted with himself . “
116973	117035	116951	116951	You	2581	” It was fascinating to see him like this . An injured animal cornered into talking about his feelings . I did n’t want to push him , so I turned to look at the view from the window , smiling to myself . When we got to Boston , I noticed he was driving to his place , not mine . “
117041	117045	117046	117046	I	140	” I demanded . “
117057	117058	117046	117046	I	140	” “
117119	117160	117113	117113	I	140	” He killed the engine and got out of the car . I followed him , my mouth hanging open in astonishment , delight , and irritation . Only Sam could set all three on fire at the same time . “
117163	117167	117113	117113	I	140	” I demanded . “
117170	117202	117113	117113	I	140	” Sam took out a pair of keys from his pocket , dangling them between his fingers in front of my face . I recognized them to be my house keys . “
117261	118429	117247	117248	The burglar	2591	” That night I fucked Nix the way I ’d always planned to . In leisure , without feeling her family breathing down my fucking neck . Bent her over my desk and plowed into her while she screamed my name . Then again in my bed and another time on the kitchen counter . After the fifth time , we both fell into bed , exhausted and sweaty . For the first time in my life , I fell asleep with someone by my side . Felt a woman ’s warmth next to mine . There was still some way to go . She had to quit her god - awful job and take a more traditional position as a doctor . But we were going places . When I woke up in the morning , I turned over on my back and flung an arm out to her . Her side of the bed was cold . I opened one eye , frowning . She was gone . She left a note on the nightstand . Thanks for the sex , but you are still not off the hook . — Nix . Aisling refused to see me the next day . And the day after that . And the day after . She did n’t take my calls , did n’t show up when I drove over to her house , and would n’t read my text messages . And there were so fucking many of them . Much more than I ’d ever sent anyone else . Sam : Stop acting like a child . Sam : All I need is to show up at the clinic if I want to see you . Sam : You proved your point . We can renegotiate your job . Sam : You ’re getting on my last nerve , Nix , and you do n’t want to see what happens when I finally snap . Sam : This is why I never wanted a relationship . For better or worse , the last sentence triggered her , because she chose to reply . Nix : No one is forcing you to be with me . Sam : That ’s not entirely true . Something was , in fact , forcing me to be with her . My lack of ability to keep away from her . Ignoring her was manageable before we fell into bed , before we spent time together , before I found out things about her . Pussy was pussy , and with my eyes closed , it was easy to imagine fucking Aisling when I was deep inside someone else . But no one else was going to cut it now , no matter how much I wanted to turn around and walk away from her . It was going to be difficult and maddening and definitely take me out of my comfort zone , but I could n’t not have her , however how much I tried . Nix : Are you going to elaborate ? Sam : No . Sam : Have dinner with me tonight . Nix : Not until you apologize . You moved my things into your apartment , Sam . Without asking . Who does that ? Sam : I ’m assuming this is a hypothetical question . Nix : We ’ll do things my way now . And my way might be frustrating to you . It ’s about what I ’m comfortable with , not about making you pay . Sam : You ’re already making me pay . I ’m not accustomed to not getting what I want . Nix : Life is hard . Sam : So am I. Nix : You sound like Hunter . I was . I finally realized why Hunter was so obsessed with my sister . Why Cillian could n’t tear himself away from Persephone . There was something addicting about a woman who gave you her everything . Something that was hard to walk away from once you ’d tasted it . Sam : I will have you , one way or the other . Nix : We ’ll see about that . That was what she did n’t take into account . It took a monster to destroy a monster . And I was going to devour her whole . Sam and I spent the next two months playing this chess game . Whenever he ’d make a move too bold , I ’d retreat . I made him work for it . Work for it like he had n’t in an entire decade . There was something to be said about unrequited love . It taught you resilience and bravery and strength . Now , the tables had turned , and I wanted him to show me I was n’t the flavor of the month . That I was worthy of his attention , his affection , his everything . I could n’t allow him to take what I had offered for free for ten years . I had to put a price tag on my absolute devotion . And that price tag was love . I wanted to feel loved . As with everything he did , Sam brought his A - game to the table . He would corner me in places , follow me , steal dirty kisses when no one was watching . Maybe another girl would have been alarmed by it , but I relished his attention . His new desperation for my touch . He waited for me outside a Thai restaurant when I went out with Persy , Sailor , and Belle , snatching me into a dark alley and kissing me roughly , his hands between my legs pushing my skirt up . Three days later , he ambushed me outside the clinic , dragged me into his car , and fucked me raw in the backseat , giving me a small heart attack and a raging orgasm . Four days after , I visited his apartment to grab a dress I wanted to wear for a charity event . Most of my clothes were still at his place , and even though he ’d left me the code for his apartment lock , he refused to let me take my things back to Avebury Court Manor . One day , I caught him sitting on a stool by his kitchen island , catching up on some work on his laptop . When I trudged in and yanked my desired Armani dress from the closet , he raised his eyes from the laptop coldly . I expected him to stop me and have his way with me before I made my way out of the apartment , but all he did was salute me with a touch of his fingers to his forehead , bidding me goodbye . I stopped by the door , confused . “
118441	118494	117247	117248	The burglar	2591	” The subtext was obvious : I am going to sleep with you , but I ’m not going to move in with you . I will not commit to you . I will not give you more than I am ready to give . Sam kept his eyes on the screen . “
118506	118507	117247	117248	The burglar	2591	” “
118510	118523	117247	117248	The burglar	2591	” Yes . He smirked , his eyes still on the screen . “
118535	118536	117247	117248	The burglar	2591	” “
118547	118639	118541	118541	I	140	” For some reason , my feet were glued to his floor . I could n’t leave without figuring out what had changed . Had he finally given up on us ? Maybe he decided I was simply not worth the effort . I wanted to punch my own face for putting him through so much . But then again , I did n’t regret any of it . He deserved to repent for what he ’d done to my family , and I was n’t sure he was done paying . “
118649	118685	118641	118641	I	140	” he murmured , taking a sip from the glass of brandy sitting next to him . Staring at him dumbly , I shifted the dress on the hanger from one shoulder to the other . “
118702	118716	118763	118763	Merde	147	” I pointed out . He finally lifted his eyes from the screen . “
118730	118731	118732	118732	I	140	” “
118743	118762	118763	118763	Merde	147	” I put on a brave face , forcing myself to smile . Internally , I was shouting , “
118768	118836	118763	118763	Merde	147	” to the moon . He was dumping me . I knew I was making things hard for him , but Sam never showed any signs of looking tired or distressed . If anything , he took our new game in a stride and always had that dangerous , mischievous glint in his eyes of a man entertained by having to work for it for a change . “
118840	118856	118763	118763	Merde	147	” He took another sip of his drink , his eyes never wavering from mine . “
118862	118880	118763	118763	Merde	147	” I threw my head back and laughed hysterically . Get married . Us . Good one . “
118886	118890	118763	118763	Merde	147	” I provided . “
118893	118897	118763	118763	Merde	147	” he agreed . “
118916	118917	118763	118763	Merde	147	” “
118926	118936	118921	118921	I	140	” I said with more conviction than I felt . “
118948	118953	118944	118944	I	140	” He ’d nodded . “
118965	118966	118944	118944	I	140	” “
118978	118979	118974	118974	I	140	” “
119018	119118	119119	119119	You	2598	” I did n’t dance with anyone at the charity ball . I was nailed to my seat , punished , thinking about one thing — marriage . After that night , Sam did seek me out again and we never went all the way anymore . Never clawed at each other ’s clothes or had wild sex . He showed up in places I went to but only enjoyed heavy petting and kissing . Every time I tried to stir him into full - blown sex territory , he would clap his hand over my wrist and say , “
119143	119144	119133	119133	you	2598	” “
119147	119472	119473	119473	I	140	” It went on and on and on , week in and week out , to a point where I was n’t sure if I was not done hating him for what he ’d done or if I was just enjoying the chase too much . It was entirely possible I lost myself somewhere in our game , and I did n’t know how to find my way back to what we were . The truth was , I did want to move in with him . I wanted to move in with him very badly . Not because taking care of Mother was daunting — on the contrary , she had actually been quite okay , everything considered — but because I missed him terribly every time we were apart . I was just afraid he was going to break my heart again , and this time , I knew I would n’t be able to mend it back to health . Right now , we were in the twilight zone . On the edge of something deep but still with the possibility of swimming back ashore . I was afraid if I lost that edge , my resistance as a result of being pushed around by him , he would conquer what little I ’d kept for myself , and it would be game over for me . I think Sam knew it , too . That we were stuck in limbo , and we did n’t know how to stop . Even our families , who little by little began to see each other again for dinners , looked at us with puzzled bewilderment every time Sam treated me gently in public and I gave him the cold shoulder . One day , when he came to my house to drop off some paperwork for Athair and stayed for coffee , he grabbed my hand from across the table and frowned . “
119498	119499	119501	119501	you	140	” “
119503	119528	119501	119501	you	140	” I yanked my hand away from him like he was made of fire , taking a slow sip of my too hot coffee . “
119534	119535	119536	119536	I	140	” “
119586	119624	119579	119579	You	140	” My blood bubbled with rage . So much so I did n’t take a second to decode his words or figure out if he was goading me , deliberately moving another piece in our chess game . “
119632	119645	119625	119625	I	140	” I stood up abruptly , yanking my coffee from the table . “
119684	119711	119667	119667	I	140	” I smiled , feeling much better about provoking him back . Oui , mon cheri . Always showing the maturity level of a wet tissue . “
119717	119748	119667	119667	I	140	” Sam drawled , getting up from his seat . Just then , my father came into the kitchen , holding his ledgers under his armpit , looking between us . “
119752	119753	119667	119667	I	140	” “
119756	119762	119667	119667	I	140	” Sam grinned at me . “
119767	120133	119667	119667	I	140	” Staying true to my word , I showed up at Badlands the following weekend . As always , I invited Belle to join me . I did n’t tell my friends about Sam yet , but this time it had nothing to do with my fear of being judged by them . Things were still complicated between him and me , to say the least , and my brothers were n’t privy to what was going on . I knew Sailor and Persy were going to confide in my brothers no matter what , and I did n’t want to complicate things for all of us for something that might not materialize . Belle looked to be in good spirits and ready to tackle the night in a skintight red leather mini - dress and matching lipstick . As soon as we got into the club — this time I did show my ID to the bouncers — she headed to the dance floor . I was still shocked by the fact they let me in . The balance of power had shifted , and true , I did n’t have most of it , but I did n’t have any less power than Sam did in our relationship either . He said I did n’t come here out of obedience , and I wanted to show him it was n’t true . At the same time , texting him I was here was too blatant , too transparent , and I knew that if Sam was here on the premises chances were he was n’t going to come to the dance floor . I wanted to press where it hurt . To show Sam I was n’t his little plaything . And so after seeing Belle was content on the dance floor , I marched toward the narrow hallway through which Sam had led me all those months ago , on Halloween , when I desperately got on my knees for him , taking the scraps he threw my way while masquerading as a stranger . Two burly bouncers stood at the edge of the hallway , arms crossed , blocking my way . “
120138	120207	119667	119667	I	140	” I tilted my chin up . They looked at me in amusement but did n’t move . As if the mere idea was ridiculous . Women were n’t allowed in the card rooms . Cillian once told me the official reason for that was because gambling and whores went together , and Sam did n’t want respectable ladies getting harassed if his gamblers got the wrong idea . “
120216	120227	120228	120229	No women	2602	” I waved my hand in front of their faces . “
120232	120241	120242	120242	I	140	” one of them spat on the floor . “
120249	120268	120242	120242	I	140	” His eyes raked over my body , head to toe , halting when he reached my breasts . “
120276	120304	120242	120242	I	140	” I took out my phone , gliding my finger on the screen until I got to Sam ’s contact information , showing them his phone number . “
120333	120334	120335	120335	Brennan	560	” “
120342	120346	120347	120347	He	940	” one said . “
120351	120361	120347	120347	He	940	” I snorted , my confidence wavering a little . “
120393	120513	120514	120514	I	140	” The one who seemed hell - bent on not letting me in fished his phone out of his front pocket reluctantly , punching in Sam ’s number while glaring at me . My heart was in my throat . This was the make or break moment . Sam would know I was here . The bouncer said my name . Asked if I could come in . There was a pause on the other line . The air was still despite the hustle and bustle of people , drinks , music , and the lights around us . After a second , he hung up and bowed his head , stepping sideways . His colleague widened his eyes . “
120526	120527	120519	120519	I	140	” “
120533	120861	120862	120862	I	140	” I patted his shoulder , shouldering past them . I entered the hallway and picked the busiest , loudest , rowdiest card room . This time , I observed my surroundings more carefully than I did the night I came to fetch Cillian and Hunter . I had to look behind my shoulder for the bouncers and was too filled with white - hot rage to pay attention to anything back then . Round , deep oak tables with green centers sat across the room with men in expensive suits huddled around them , smoking fine cigars and drinking brandy . They all looked like variations of the men in my family — privileged , corrupt , and desperate for cheap entertainment . There were also waitresses wearing tiny , black baby dolls , leaning down and tending to the clientele . Scanning the room , I looked for the blackjack table . I knew how to play Texas hold ’em and seven - card stud , but my real specialty had always been blackjack . It was the first card game Cillian had taught me , and he made it a point to practice with me during Christmas Eves , after everyone had retired back to their rooms . We kept that tradition alive for decades , this year included . I found the table I was looking for and waited . I knew gambling in Sam ’s establishment was going to make him explode with anger . My heart pinched a little when I realized he most likely was not around , but I forced myself to find the silver lining . The mere idea of me being here without him was going to bring him closer to asking me to move in with him again . When the game drew to a close , I wedged myself in the middle of the semicircle of Prada - clad men , beaming at the dealer . “
120868	120869	120862	120862	I	140	” “
120877	120904	120862	120862	I	140	” a middle - aged man beside me jested , making the entire circle of men laugh crudely . I refused to let my smile drop . “
120912	120929	120862	120862	I	140	” One of them frowned at me . I kept my gaze carefully on the dealer . “
120952	121018	120945	120946	your daddy	2963	” I was three years shy of turning thirty , so this definitely stung , but maybe I deserved it for putting my parents ’ needs before mine for almost three decades and still living at their place . I stared at the dealer , ignoring the idiot talking to me . The older employee cleared his throat , widening his bowtie with his finger . “
121025	121026	121021	121021	I	140	” “
121043	121097	121098	121098	I	140	” I demanded , clinging onto my false confidence . I was becoming aware of a warm , tingly sensation that spread from the top of my head down my spine . I knew exactly what it meant , and who just entered the room , but he did n’t make himself known . “
121117	121118	121119	121119	Me	140	” “
121132	121145	121126	121126	Brennan	560	” I rolled up the sleeves of my Balmain mini - dress . “
121207	121208	121214	121214	sweetheart	140	” “
121230	121347	121219	121219	I	140	” a low voice mocked behind me . My head snapped toward the door . Sam stood there , wearing a pale gray suit with a burgundy Hermes pocket square poking out of his blazer . A gorgeous sin in Italian loafers . He looked ready for a date . Ready for me , his skin gold and warm , his eyes gray and cold . He knew I was going to come here the minute he challenged me to do so , and I fell right into his trap . I looked away , ignoring him and turning my attention back to the dealer . I remembered what he told me all those years ago . “
121355	121356	121219	121219	I	140	” “
121359	121360	121361	121361	I	140	” “
121365	121461	121462	121462	She	2614	” For the first time in a long time , I did n’t feel the warm excitement that came with seeing him , and my insides did n’t turn into baby food as they usually had . Something about him felt daring , quiet , and on edge tonight . Like the old Sam , the one who did n’t want me . I felt like he was on the brink of showing me very publicly how much I abused his patience . I shifted from one foot to the other on my high heels . “
121470	121510	121462	121462	She	2614	” Sam sauntered deeper into the room behind me , his voice drawing closer , and I was aware of the curious glances thrown my way . I refused to turn around and give him the audience he demanded . “
121527	121539	121540	121540	I	140	” I muttered , feeling the color rising in my cheeks . “
121551	121568	121548	121549	a monster	481	” He stopped beside me , not removing his gaze from my face for a second . “
121575	121587	121573	121573	Nix	140	” I did n’t . I looked anywhere but at him . “
121600	121604	121588	121588	I	140	” he finished . “
121625	121675	121617	121617	I	140	” I turned around , facing him . Men whistled and chuckled , enjoying their front - row seat to our exchange . They obviously were n’t used to seeing anyone stand up to Sam Brennan , let alone a dainty woman in a dress . Sam smiled calmly . “
121685	121686	121682	121683	Miss Fitzpatrick	195	” “
121698	121735	121692	121692	I	140	” I deadpanned , making everyone in the room erupt into rowdy laughter . Did he really just try to financially intimidate me ? I had more money than all the men in this room combined . “
121748	121848	121849	121849	You	2618	” I asked , my voice prim and proper , offering him my hand for a shake . The place exploded with hoots , laughter , and shrieks . The men were on fire . Everyone looked at Sam expectantly , knowing he was not a man to bow out of a challenge . Sam glanced at my outstretched hand , hands still in his pockets , his posture lazy . He was in no hurry to answer . He obviously savored this moment . Our first public exchange in the ten years since we ’d known each other . “
121857	121861	121862	121862	Dang	375	” He smirked . “
121864	121865	121862	121862	Dang	375	” “
121869	121870	121871	121871	Bryan	4020	” “
121879	121948	121871	121871	Bryan	4020	” Our audience grew as more men yelled and gasped to each other , people trickling from nearby rooms , craning their necks as the thick circle of bodies around us grew bigger and tighter . I felt the ring of men around me , like it was squeezing my neck . Cigarettes were put down , drinks were left unattended , everyone waited to hear my reply . “
121953	122026	121871	121871	Bryan	4020	” I hitched one shoulder up , raising my untouched hand an inch , hysteria clogging up my throat . Just because I had this kind of money did n’t mean I wanted to see twenty - five million dollars flushed down the drain in half an hour . I felt my armpits dampen and started second - guessing my coming here . Why did I want to push him so much ? “
122032	122041	122029	122029	I	140	” he raised his palm up to stop me “
122047	122078	122043	122043	you	2619	” The dealer looked between us , dropping the stack of cards in his hand in shock . The middle - aged man who propositioned me rubbed his hands together . “
122091	122123	122043	122043	you	2619	” I stared at Sam silently , stone - cold sober , searching for mockery in his eyes . I found none , but I still could n’t believe my ears . “
122129	122143	122144	122144	I	140	” My voice came out gravelly , crawling its way out my throat . “
122149	122165	122144	122144	I	140	” he countered softly , his eyes never leaving mine , delivering the final blow . “
122172	122173	122144	122144	I	140	” “
122176	122247	122248	122248	Sweetheart	377	” Men bent backward , slapping their foreheads dramatically . I was lucky I was propped against the table because every muscle in my body ceased to work . I wondered if it was another stop in his destination to full domination over Boston , marrying into the richest family with no prenup . Was I just a pawn in his game ? Another juicy deal waiting to be sealed ? “
122269	122289	122290	122290	I	140	” one man hollered from the depths of the room . Sam smirked , neither confirming nor denying it . “
122312	122336	122302	122302	I	140	” another young man shouted . Smiling and refusing to withdraw my hand and cower like everyone expected me to , I said , “
122381	122382	122383	122383	I	140	” “
122386	122391	122383	122383	I	140	” he said calmly . “
122402	122410	122411	122411	I	140	” Our audience laughed and hooted loudly . “
122420	122430	122431	122431	I	140	” I enunciated , my voice clear and unwavering . “
122476	122477	122478	122478	I	140	” “
122484	122488	122478	122478	I	140	” I lied . “
122530	122531	122533	122533	you	2626	” “
122535	122604	122533	122533	you	2626	” I mouthed the words rather than said them aloud , shock still gripping me . My father was going to kill me . Cillian and Hunter were going to burn whatever was left of me . Yet somehow I believed Sam ’s motive was n’t money . He had enough of it . He wanted to trap me . And me ? I wanted to be trapped . “
122607	122657	122533	122533	you	2626	” I said shakily , my stomach turning a hundred times over . Sam finally clasped my hand in his , but instead of shaking it , he used our entwined fingers to jerk me toward him , pressing a very public , very possessive kiss on my mouth . “
122669	122867	122663	122663	They	2630	” A young man in a sage green velvet suit jumped up from his seat . There was chaos in the room for the next few minutes , and I tried to gulp deep breaths and tell myself it did n’t matter . None of it did . I could dig my way out of this . Maybe . The stakes for a game were never this high in the history of Badlands . Bookies rolled in from other rooms to take bets on the game , holding clipboards with spreadsheets , taking names and numbers and odds . I recognized Becker and Angus , the soldiers I had treated last year , shuffling about , whispering between them as they placed their bet against me . There was a human traffic jam outside the door to the card room , and I could barely breathe when I heard the bouncers physically pushing people away . We both took our places in front of the dealer , whose golden nametag said Daniel . I drummed my fingers against the green felt of the table . Sam stared at me . I refused to look back at him . “
122881	122890	122871	122871	Your	2631	” I flicked my hair behind my shoulder . “
122901	122906	122891	122891	I	140	” he replied wryly . “
122915	122920	122908	122908	you	2631	” my voice quivered . “
122923	123346	122908	122908	you	2631	” Everyone settled , and Daniel started shuffling the cards , reciting the rules of the game loud and clear . He made a show of it . First with an overhand shuffle , a riffle shuffle , then a pile shuffle . By the time he was done , the cards were thoroughly mixed , even I could n’t deny that . Daniel put the neat stack of cards down , glancing between Sam and me . Sam jerked his chin toward me , deciding now was a good time to become a gentleman . I refused to remove my gaze from the cards , splitting them into two stacks . Why was I so hysterical ? Was n’t it my longtime wish ? To marry Sam Brennan ? Oui , mon cheri , but not like this . Not as a part of another elaborate game between you two . I withdrew my hand and indicated for Daniel to choose from the right - hand stack . We were each dealt two cards . Daniel also dealt himself a hand . One exposed , one hidden . The first round was a quick win for me , allowing me to breathe again . I spluttered around an exhale , wondering if it was Sam ’s way of making me lower my guard . The second round went to Sam , after I doubled down and lost , making my rival flash a devious smirk . The third — to me . The fourth — to Sam . The eerie feeling everything was premeditated took root in my stomach . Perhaps Sam had intentionally made this game a close call to make people more interested . Statistically , the neatness of our wins , and losses , seemed highly unlikely . He was engineering a narrative where anything could happen , and it made me even more nervous because that meant he knew he would win . I never lose . Sam played against casinos and won repeatedly . The chances of him losing twice , out of four times , were slim to nonexistent . By the time we were dealt our fifth hands , I was a sweaty pile of mess . My hair was plastered to my temples , and everything in me shook . No matter the result , I was going to be devastated . I did n’t want his money , but marrying him right now seemed as impossible as kissing the moon good night . “
123364	123478	123361	123362	Miss Fitzpatrick	195	” Sam shot me an impersonal smile as Daniel cut the cards . The whole room held its breath . I got confused and did n’t stand with a pair of nines when Daniel ’s up - card was a seven , even though Cillian had taught me to do so . Sam split a pair of eights and aces . Sam won . Three to two . Fair and square . The whole room erupted in screams , arguments , and laughter as hands exchanged thick stacks of money . People huddled over the betting books . Others clapped Sam ’s back and whistled , shaking his hand with a smug smile . “
123493	123494	123361	123362	Miss Fitzpatrick	195	” “
123509	123510	123511	123511	You	2632	” “
123516	123517	123511	123511	You	2632	” “
123528	123711	123507	123507	man	560	” Nausea washed over me , and I gripped the edges of the table with force . I lost . Not only tonight but the last decade . We were always playing a game , at least that was how it felt , and this was the pinnacle of a ten - year battle . It did n’t matter that I wanted it . That I wished for it . That I longed for it . Sam Brennan won me , but he did n’t earn me . What kind of marriage would I have to a man who did n’t want to have children and hated women ? Sam ignored the congratulations , strolling the short distance to meet me , his face unreadable . Everyone stopped to see what happened next . I could n’t blame them . I wanted to know , too . I did n’t move . Did n’t run away . The least I could do was handle the situation with dignity . A Fitzpatrick never bowed down . Sam stopped a foot away from me . “
123732	123813	123727	123727	I	140	” I offered him my hand again , my voice quiet and resolute . He narrowed his eyes at me , like we were enemies . Maybe we were . I never knew where we stood . He cupped my throat , angling my face up to look him in the eye . When he spoke , it was to the room , not to me , but his words were loud and clear , filling the air with poison . “
123912	124028	124029	124029	You	2640	” With that , he crashed his lips down on mine , sealing our deal with an animalistic kiss . People cheered in the background , but we paid no attention to them . I paid no attention to them , completely immersed in this thing between us , my heart soaring to the sky . Sam hoisted me up and carried me out of the card room , shouldering past dozens of men , heading straight to his office . My legs wrapped around his waist , my tongue dancing inside his mouth . We reached the point of no return . There were no more games to be played . We were together . “
124037	124069	124029	124029	You	2640	” he growled into my mouth , kicking the door to his office open and slamming it shut behind us without touching the handle , his fingers digging into my behind . “
124072	124083	124029	124029	You	2640	” I insisted breathlessly , peppering his neck with kisses . “
124109	124110	124103	124103	I	140	” “
124119	124123	124124	124124	You	2640	” he countered . “
124144	124202	124203	124203	Belle	167	” He let me down , turned to his desk , and in one go wiped it clean of his laptop , ledgers , and paperwork . He grabbed my waist roughly and turned me around to face the desk , bending me over as he hoisted my dress up , tugging my panties to the side . “
124210	124225	124203	124203	Belle	167	” I warned , panting hard , so wet my thighs were sticking together . “
124251	124314	124317	124317	Monster	441	” He thrust into me from behind , and the unexpectedness of it , the sheer surprise made a loud moan slip between my lips . He snaked one arm between my legs and started playing with my clit as he entered me mercilessly , picking up pace , driving me mad as he hit my G - spot again and again . “
124319	124320	124321	124321	Mine	140	” “
124323	124340	124341	124341	Mine	140	” He leaned down , brushing my hair from my ear , biting the lobe softly . “
124350	124396	124348	124348	mine	140	” he chanted , moving his fingers from between my thighs , up to my breasts , kneading them . His fingers traveled north again , and he pushed them into my mouth , coated with my arousal , to stop me from moaning loudly . “
124404	124432	124401	124402	little Nix	140	” His breath tickled the back of my neck and my ear , sending goose bumps down my body , making me clench around him even more . “
124478	124655	124475	124475	you	140	” I nodded jerkily , my body quaking with an impending climax that threatened to tear through my bones . From this angle , he was so deep inside me , I felt impossibly full . I swear the man was rearranging my guts . My fingers dug into the wood of the table , my teeth sinking into Sam ’s fingers in my bid to stifle a groan . The orgasm racked through me like a tornado , ripping everything inside me in its wake . He must ’ve sensed my orgasm because he , too , let go of the sliver of self - control he still possessed and began thrusting erratically , coming inside me in warm spurts , grabbing the base of my neck and pulling me to his mouth for a kiss full of tongue . We stayed in this position for a few moments , him deep inside me , the last of his cum dripping into me . He placed a chaste kiss on the top of my head . “
124660	124696	124475	124475	you	140	” he said dryly , his face turning cold and expressionless again , putting his mask back on now that we were done . This time , I smiled , knowing it was n’t personal . “
124704	124705	124699	124699	you	2642	” “
124708	124721	124699	124699	you	2642	” He pulled out slowly , massaging my butt in the process . “
124779	124792	124772	124772	I	140	” He squeezed my ass , pushing me toward the door playfully . “
124803	124816	124801	124801	Nix	140	” I was marrying a bastard . But he was my bastard . “
124822	124874	124801	124801	Nix	140	” Belle waited for me by the bouncers , leaning on the balls of her feet , just outside the card rooms . They would n’t let her in . By the looks she sent them , I could tell no love was lost between her and the two burly men . “
124898	124923	124929	124929	Belle	167	” she raged . I threw myself between her arms , even though they were n’t technically open , squeezing her in a hug . “
124963	124964	124956	124956	we	2648	” “
124971	124999	124968	124968	Ya	2649	” Belle gave me a sarcastic look , still in shock , pulling away from me while patting my shoulder to show me she was n’t mad . “
125066	125267	125060	125060	you	2656	” Let them think that , I thought . In a way , it was true . Sam and I were always lovers . Even when we did n’t speak or touch each other at all . That night , I went home with Sam . It was only when we entered his apartment that I realized that the place felt completely and irrevocably mine . Somewhere down the line , his place had become my home . It housed my clothes , my shoes , my toiletries , and the man I love . Still in a daze , I walked around the living room , brushing my fingers over the minimal furniture , the bare walls ; I knew there was a good chance our house was never going to have any art in it , no paintings , no beloved vintage knickknacks to fill the place with personality and warmth . I was oddly okay with that . With the loss of art in the name of love . I was facing the window overlooking Boston ’s cityscape , sparkling in the nighttime like masses of tiny stars , when I heard Sam ’s voice behind me . “
125277	125446	125060	125060	you	2656	” I did . Our phones were both blowing up with calls all the way from Badlands . At first , we shoved them into my purse , but when that did n’t help , and the buzzing and lit screens kept taunting us , we turned them off completely . I was pretty sure my brothers and parents were fully intending to knock this door down any minute now , only they could n’t because they did n’t know where Sam lived . I found that little fact strangely liberating . The irony of living somewhere my parents could n’t find me , after being under their thumb for so long . His footsteps pressed down on the floor underneath us . I felt him stop right behind my back . He took my left hand while I was still facing the window , sliding a ring onto my ring finger . My breath caught , and my heart stuttered , the unreliable monster that it was . “
125452	125482	125483	125483	Sam	560	” he whispered into my ear . I nodded , waiting . He dropped a kiss to the crown of my head , and I felt dizzy with pleasure . “
125485	125489	125483	125483	Sam	560	” I breathed . “
125492	125513	125514	125514	I	140	” he asked , catching the zipper of my dress , sliding it down seductively . I cleared my throat . “
125518	125540	125514	125514	I	140	” He stopped unzipping me . I found my voice again . I could n’t not talk to him about it . “
125566	125611	125564	125564	us	2662	” Holding my breath , I waited . After a few seconds , he resumed the work of undressing me , sliding the zipper down all the way . The dress pooled at my feet like a shimmering lake of burgundy blood and glitter . “
125614	125624	125625	125625	I	140	” His lips skimmed the hollow of my neck . “
125655	125762	125643	125643	I	140	” I swallowed hard , closing my eyes . My patients were so dear to me . Their well - being , supporting them meant everything . But he was right . If someone caught me , I ’d be locked up for life . Becoming a mother and doing something so dangerous simply did n’t go together . Especially since my future children ’s father had a less than respectable job , too . Someone would have to be their anchor . The reliable parent who goes out to work and comes back every day , no matter what . I felt my eyelids drooping . “
125770	125771	125772	125773	Good girl	310	” “
125775	125785	125772	125773	Good girl	310	” He kissed my cheek , unfastening my bra . “
125794	125836	125837	125837	Troy	952	” I turned around to face him , wearing nothing but my underwear and the ring . I blinked at it . A gasp of shock and pleasure escaped me . I looked up to Sam with eyes full of tears . “
125893	125937	125883	125883	They	2664	” He took my hand and kissed the ring , a huge halo ring of diamonds surrounding the center stone — an emerald - cut octagon - shaped sapphire . I kissed it , too , laughing and crying at the same time . “
125950	125960	125948	125948	you	310	” I whispered , referring to our blackjack game . “
125966	125977	125978	125978	I	140	” He cupped my cheeks , pulling me to him . “
126021	126022	126023	126023	I	140	” “
126032	126051	126030	126030	Brennan	952	” Cillian Fitzpatrick stormed into my office at Badlands the following day , with Hunter trailing behind him . “
126075	126162	126069	126069	We	2666	” I sat back in my seat , smirking as I tapped my fingers over my mouth . It had been three hours since I dropped Aisling off at the clinic to hand in her resignation , and already I missed her like crazy . The idea of giving up on the engagement after she ’d agreed to it seemed as far from reality as letting Cillian and Hunter shove a ten - foot spiky dildo into my ass while I watch reruns of Hannah Montana . “
126170	126174	126069	126069	We	2666	” I drawled . “
126179	126191	126195	126196	my sister	1070	” Cillian stopped in front of my desk , his fists clenched “
126202	126203	126195	126196	my sister	1070	” “
126233	126243	126231	126231	you	2668	” I turned to Hunter before he opened his mouth “
126283	126292	126296	126296	bro	2668	” Hunter lifted his hands up in surrender . “
126318	126319	126308	126308	I	140	” “
126328	126455	126308	126308	I	140	” I frowned . The entrance was manned by two bodyguards . Cillian took a seat in front of me , and Hunter occupied the chair beside him as they both invited themselves to stay . Cillian and Hunter had no idea what went on between me , their father , Aisling and Jane , and I intended to keep it that way . Not because I gave a fuck about what they thought but because I knew it would hurt Aisling if her brothers doubted my devotion to her . And she would be upset when Hunter and Cillian passed the information along to Persephone , Sailor , and Devon , making the fact I stabbed her in the back a well - known matter . “
126467	126485	126460	126460	Johnny	383	” Hunter waved his hand around dismissively , referring to the bouncers standing at the front door . “
126499	126500	126460	126460	Johnny	383	” “
126517	126604	126605	126606	Your sister	1057	” Cillian lit up a cigar . The stench of the burning rolled tobacco drifted around the room , and I tried to remember what I liked about smoking . Cigars smelled like feet on fire , and cigarettes were their cheaper equivalent . It was peculiar . How both bad and good habits were born from boredom . How they turned into an obsession , an addiction , before you knew it . And how taking back control from them became a habit in itself . “
126612	126631	126632	126632	She	1057	” I laced my fingers together on my desk , trying to keep the disdain from my voice . “
126667	126668	126674	126674	you	2677	” “
126692	126720	126674	126674	you	2677	” Cillian retorted . Cillian was n’t wrong , but he could n’t prove his suspicion either , so I just flashed him a barely tolerant smile . “
126726	126727	126722	126722	you	2677	” “
126732	126733	126722	126722	you	2677	” “
126831	126832	126835	126835	us	2681	” “
126841	126849	126835	126835	us	2681	” Cillian narrowed his eyes at me . “
126891	126934	126885	126885	you	2677	” He held his cigar between his teeth , half - smiling . The problem with Cillian was that , unlike most of my rich clients , he was smart and observant . Those things were definitely a thorn in my side . “
126937	126944	126885	126885	you	2677	” I smacked my lips together . “
126995	126996	126988	126988	Jane	2875	” “
127004	127015	127001	127001	you	2677	” Cillian yawned . I doubted he cared , too . “
127019	127069	127070	127070	You	2677	” I chuckled . Hunter , the only one out of us three who actually gave a fuck , confirmed that she was still attending therapy . Good for her . She needed all the help she could get because I was never letting her emotionally manipulate Aisling again . “
127076	127100	127070	127070	You	2677	” Hunter ’s gaze flicked to my desk , which now lacked the usual mountain of ashtrays , cigarette packs , and Zippos . “
127119	127120	127112	127112	I	140	” “
127126	127130	127123	127123	my	140	” I said . “
127133	127140	127123	127123	my	140	” Hunter ’s eyes lit up . “
127143	127151	127123	127123	my	140	” I deadpanned , looking between them . “
127172	127184	127123	127123	my	140	” I snapped my fingers , making a show of reminding them “
127203	127204	127123	127123	my	140	” “
127213	127221	127205	127205	You	2677	” Hunter jested , wiggling his brows . “
127226	127240	127205	127205	You	2677	” Cillian put his cigar out , standing up and buttoning his blazer , “
127256	127257	127258	127258	I	140	” “
127265	127270	127258	127258	I	140	” I bit out , “
127278	127279	127272	127272	she	1057	” “
127286	127290	127280	127280	She	1057	” Hunter frowned . “
127294	127295	127280	127280	She	1057	” “
127311	127340	127308	127309	your sister	1057	” I grunted , annoyed that I had to spell it out for him , like he did n’t know what it meant to be pussy - whipped . “
127351	127356	127349	127349	you	2677	” Hunter grinned smugly . “
127370	127419	127365	127365	I	140	” Cillian warned . I was about to answer when someone kicked the door down , sending it flying off its hinges and skating along the floor . I reached for my gun in my desk ’s drawer , but the two men in the balaclavas were faster . “
127426	127441	127442	127442	We	2691	” one said in a thick Russian accent , pointing his gun at me . “
127449	127537	127538	127538	Johnny	383	” He shot two bullets into my chest . Everything went black . I slipped in and out of consciousness as they rushed me to the hospital . I could n’t feel any pain in my chest or my shoulder , which could n’t have been a good sign . Everything was blurry . The white punishing florescent light forced me to close my eyes as soon as I opened them . In the background , I heard Cillian and Hunter ’s voices , and Devon ’s . “
127544	127556	127538	127538	Johnny	383	” Hunter said , unaware that I was half - conscious . “
127565	127566	127567	127567	Troy	952	” “
127572	127576	127577	127577	He	952	” Cillian quipped . “
127608	127657	127659	127659	Ash	133	” In that moment , I was glad my friends were n’t total dumbasses . I must ’ve groaned because Cillian ’s head snapped in my direction . The doctor and nurse behind me shooed my entourage away . We must have been heading into the operating room . “
127661	127683	127659	127659	Ash	133	” I tried to say , but even though I could move my mouth , it did n’t produce any sound . “
127686	127718	127720	127720	Ash	133	” Hunter reached over to squeeze my hand . For fuck ’s sake , what was he going to do next ? Cut the cord when I delivered his fucking baby ? “
127722	127804	127805	127805	I	140	” I roared , hoping my hearing was impaired due to the gunshots and that I did n’t lose my fucking vocal chords . Cillian and Hunter stopped dead in their tracks behind the medical staff as my gurney burst through the double doors . I had to stay alive . I had to . Not for me . For her . I closed my eyes again . For the first time in my life , I was losing a fight . “
127808	127855	127805	127805	I	140	” Dr. Doyle and I were sitting in front of each other , filling out charts . I blurted the words before I chickened out , making the older man straighten in his seat . He watched me through the thick rim of his reading glasses . “
127864	127921	127922	127922	I	140	” he said finally , and all the air rushed out from my lungs in a desperate sigh . Even though I knew Dr. Doyle had been wanting me to explore more legal and accomplishing means of medicine , I also knew he had his hands full here at the clinic , and he needed help . “
127926	127939	127922	127922	I	140	” I covered my face with both hands , shaking my head . “
127943	127952	127922	127922	I	140	” I heard the smile in his voice . “
128010	128011	127997	127997	I	140	” “
128018	128019	128020	128020	She	217	” “
128024	128047	128020	128020	She	217	” he hurried to say . Then , realizing his poor choice of words , he gave a small chuckle and added , “
128062	128087	128053	128053	I	140	” I swallowed . He was a great doctor . I was n’t worried about his abilities , I was worried about his workload . “
128095	128211	128212	128212	I	140	” I asked Dr. Doyle , peeking at him through my fingers fanned across my face . The engagement ring still felt heavy on my finger . Strange and foreign and yet like a cloak of security I ’d never worn before . Dr. Doyle ’s eyes halted on the huge sapphire ring , but other than his smile tugging wider , he did n’t mention it . It was obvious he put two and two together . Engagement meant marriage , and marriage oftentimes meant babies , and if there was one thing my children deserved , it was at least one parent who would n’t be at risk of being thrown into prison . “
128232	128245	128246	128246	You	2700	” He dropped his pen on the chart he was filling out . “
128263	128269	128272	128272	I	140	” he motioned around the room “
128363	128385	128346	128346	You	954	” he said wistfully , staring at an invisible point behind my shoulder , looking far away all of a sudden . “
128433	128478	128431	128431	child	2706	” I looked down and noticed my phone was beeping with an incoming text . I slid the screen with my thumb . Cillian : Clover . Hunter : Cloverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . They could wait . They sure made me wait when I needed them . “
128488	128517	128480	128480	you	954	” I gnawed on my inner cheek . I ’d been so far removed from mainstream medical institutions , finding my way back into them felt almost impossible . “
128520	128525	128480	128480	you	954	” Dr. Doyle chuckled , “
128558	129034	129039	129039	someone	474	” He got up , rounding the desk between us , and offered me his hand . I took it , rising to my feet . Dr. Doyle engulfed me in a hug . The deep , bone - crushing kind that rearranged your entire being in just the right way . When I stepped out of the clinic for the last time in my life , I found myself looking behind at the building ’s door with a soft smile but without longing . Doing what I did never truly fulfilled me . It dulled my pain . I was ready for the next chapter in my life . To stitch people back together , atoning for all the lives my future husband would no doubt rip apart . I forgive you , mon cheri . You were just a kid . Besides , maybe , just maybe I put you in an impossible situation , too , I heard Ms. B ’s voice in my head and knew , with a decent amount of both disappointment and relief , that I was n’t going to hear her voice very often from now on . Her job was truly done now . I took out my phone , striding absentmindedly to the Prius . I had a lot of missed calls from Cillian , Hunter , and Devon . Gosh , they really could n’t handle how yesterday went down with Sam and me . They needed to get over themselves . The texts , however , gave me pause . Cillian : Answer . Hunter : Please just pick up the phone . We are not trying to yell at you for the engagement . Cillian : Sam is in the hospital . Brigham . He ’s been shot twice . He ’s in critical condition . Hunter : You have to come see him . He is asking for you . Devon : Aisling , darling , your brothers are quite disoriented , too much to pay attention to the finer details . But as a solicitor , one must wonder , if you are currently at work , and your workplace is the hospital we ’re in , how come we ca n’t seem to reach you ? I jumped into the car , flooring it all the way to the hospital , my heart in my throat . My worst fear had materialized . Sam ’s sins finally caught up with him . I blasted through the ER doors , running toward the waiting area , where Hunter , Cillian , Devon , and Troy were standing with a frantic - looking Sparrow . The latter paced from side to side , seeming to be deep in conversation on the phone with her daughter , urging her not to come . “
129071	129113	129065	129065	I	140	” It was the first time I ’d seen my future in - laws since Sam proposed , and it was in less than positive circumstances . I threw myself at Hunter , grabbing onto the lapels of his pea coat . “
129118	129119	129065	129065	I	140	” “
129122	129171	129172	129172	He	2712	” Hunter said gravely , his voice lower and more concerned than I ’d ever heard before . Cillian would not look at me . Did they know something I did n’t ? The thought made me want to kneel right there and throw up on the floor . “
129213	129353	129205	129205	You	2711	” Still in a daze , I mumbled something about it being a huge hospital and not wanting to take advantage of my position , although I could tell Hunter looked at me funny . The walls were closing in on me . My family was becoming suspicious . Why had it taken me so long to get here if I worked in the premises ? Because I never actually worked here . I just could n’t tell you what it was that I did . The great irony of getting caught in the lie on the day I quit my job with Dr. Doyle did n’t escape me , but my mind was occupied with all things Sam . I stared longingly at the door Hunter gestured toward . Behind it doctors were fighting for Sam ’s life . “
129360	129445	129446	129446	He	2717	” Troy insisted , badgering Cillian and Hunter , and they recited the entire scene . How they came to talk to Sam about my engagement to him ( at this point they stared at me pointedly ) , how they discussed it at length . How they did n’t hear anything when the Russians put bullets in Johnny and Grayson ’s heads because they used a silencer . How the Bratva burst through Sam ’s office door , aiming their weapon at him . “
129452	129456	129446	129446	He	2717	” Hunter sniffled . “
129477	129630	129631	129631	Hunter	615	” All eyes lifted and rested on me , burning a hole through my face . Wrapping my arms around myself , I ignored them , waltzing over to a nearby window and staring out of it . The world kept on spinning , and it felt like losing Ms. B all over again , only much worse . Cars honked , cluttered together in neat lines on the road . Clouds sailed . Women cooed at each other ’s strollers on the streets . Suddenly , I felt bloated and swollen with resentment . At my parents for depriving me from having Sam until it was too late . At myself for listening to them , for waiting around , for denying myself of what I wanted . And at Sam , who ruthlessly devoured Boston — to the point where Boston had no choice but to devour him right back . “
129633	129661	129631	129631	Hunter	615	” I called out , still staring out the window , my eyes glued to the street . He approached me , stopping right next to me . “
129683	129684	129676	129676	I	140	” “
129689	129693	129686	129686	you	140	” He frowned . “
129728	129729	129730	129730	She	2875	” “
129734	129785	129730	129730	She	2875	” I said with conviction . The women with the strollers on the street hugged each other goodbye and went their separate ways . I was filled with nausea when I realized it was possible I would never have babies with Sam . That this could be it for us . “
129792	129936	129939	129939	Aisling	463	” Hunter nodded curtly , stepping aside to call my mother . Then , alone , with my face tilted in the opposite direction of everyone , I allowed the tears to fall . One by one , they slid down my cheeks , hot and salty . I needed to let them go or else I ’d drown . An hour later , my mother walked into the waiting room . There was still no word from the doctors inside the operating room . Several times , Sparrow , Troy , and Cillian tried to nudge me to check in with the reception , pull some strings as a doctor at this hospital . I noticed Devon and Hunter were surprisingly quiet and solemn . They knew . Mother flung her arms over my shoulders , burying her face in my neck . “
129974	130040	129959	129959	he	560	” My blood froze in my veins . I peeled her away from my body . No one else had heard what she said , but it did n’t matter . I was done being understanding of her , of her condition . Her loose tongue and looser morals had consequences , and it was time she knew it . I took a step back . “
130047	130104	130105	130105	Aisling	463	” I announced robotically . Her mouth fell open . My brothers must have kept it a secret from her . No doubt thinking the engagement might be short - lived . Well , it was n’t . There was only one way out of this engagement right now , and that was if Sam died . “
130111	130207	130208	130208	Honey	361	” She grabbed her gold necklace , rearranging it over her neck nervously . She was clad in a black velvet suit and a vintage Chanel bag , and I realized , a few moments too late , that it was n’t only her words that bothered me but also the fact she took her time getting ready to come to the hospital when I called for her . She lowered her voice , grabbing onto my wrist and tugging me to the corner of the room to make sure no one could hear us . “
130216	130227	130208	130208	Honey	361	” I yanked my arm away , scowling at her . “
130254	130255	130256	130256	Honey	361	” “
130267	130268	130265	130265	I	140	” “
130275	130283	130265	130265	I	140	” I warned , lifting a finger . “
130349	130416	130417	130417	You	361	” She stared at me , blinking , and my heart clenched when I realized we were like a filtered mirror . I looked just like her . Same dainty build , delicate bones , and coiffed hair . Same lips and nose and naturally curled eyelashes . But I was different . Strong . Resilient . She touched her fingers to her cheek , sighing . “
130525	130545	130523	130523	I	140	” she stopped , bowing her head as her shoulders began to rock to the rhythm of her sobs . “
130564	130604	130605	130605	I	140	” An icicle pierced through my heart , and I took a deep , sudden breath , reaching for a nearby wall to try to right myself . My mother continued , her eyes carefully staring at the floor . “
130749	130922	130923	130923	I	140	” I was fully aware that somewhere in my periphery , our friends and family were watching us , so I refrained from causing a scene . As it was , Hunter and Cillian looked on high alert , ready to pounce on Mother and take her away from me , knowing she had a talent for stealing the limelight , no matter the situation . Despite the initial shock and deep sense of betrayal , Dr. Doyle was right . There was nothing to be done about our pasts . The only way was forward . I could let what my mother did define our relationship or reinvent it . And standing there , while Sam was in the operating room , hanging in the balance between life and death , everything was crystal clear to me . If you loved somehow , you had to give them a second chance . Not for them . For you . I took a step toward her , tilting my head up regally . “
130994	131005	130990	130990	I	140	” She nodded , wiping her face quickly , sniffling . “
131021	131030	131014	131014	Aisling	463	” She grabbed my hands and squeezed them . “
131044	131333	131040	131040	You	140	” She ran toward the elevators on her high heels , ignoring the disturbed glares of onlookers . I was choosing me now . Me … and the man I loved . It had been six hours since I ’d arrived at the hospital , and there was still no word from the operating room . I knew no news was n’t necessarily bad news . It meant they were still working hard to save his life . I also knew that it did n’t matter . I was dangerously close to a massive heart attack . Nurses and doctors rushed in and out of the room , wearing bloodied uniforms and grave frowns . I shamelessly pounced on them , demanding answers , but they shook me off every time . The waiting room thickened with people . At first , I failed to notice it , too wrapped up in running all possible scenarios and outcomes to Sam ’s condition in my head , but now , lifting my gaze from my lap , I saw it . Troy , Sparrow , Cillian , Hunter , Devon , my parents , and Sailor were here now , together but alone , each of us shaken to the core . The distress for Sam ’s well - being was thick in the air , hanging like fog above our heads . Troy was on the phone , barking orders , demanding action , no doubt trying to find more information about the attack , planning how to strike back at the Bratva . Sparrow looked so frail , I was afraid if I reached out and touched her she would break . I moved over to her . “
131339	131419	131040	131040	You	140	” I whispered , trying to convince myself the same in the process . Hunter had told me the bullets pierced Sam ’s shoulder and chest . It was hard to estimate the damage when I had no concrete information . Finally — finally — a middle - aged doctor in stained scrubs with sweaty temples came out of the operating room . I was the first to dart in his direction , with Sparrow following closely behind me . “
131432	131438	131439	131439	I	140	” He turned to me . “
131444	131452	131439	131439	I	140	” I jerked Sparrow close to me . “
131466	131492	131458	131458	Please	313	” He ran his gaze over me skeptically . He was n’t supposed to hand out information to those who were n’t Sam ’s kin . “
131506	131518	131501	131504	An OB - GYN	192	” Sparrow explained , putting a protective hand over my shoulder . “
131524	131539	131519	131519	You	2738	” The doctor shot me another look and turned his focus back to Sparrow . “
131699	131740	131687	131687	we	2740	” Sparrow and I exchanged glances . I did n’t dare hope . She was his mom , after all . She deserved to see him first . My future mother - in - law squeezed my hand in hers . “
131829	131830	131825	131825	You	2746	” “
131835	131850	131832	131832	you	2746	” I bit my lower lip . She smiled , pain marring her expression . “
131856	131896	131899	131899	he	560	” I followed Dr. McKinnley along the narrow linoleum hallway like a punished kid , not sure what was waiting for me at the end of the journey . When the surgeon pushed the door open , he said , “
131913	131992	131995	131995	Sam	560	” I nodded , closing the door after me and staring at Sam from a safe distant . I was a doctor . I ’d seen blood and gore in my life . But there was something about Sam ’s pain that was too intimate and real to me . He lay there with his eyes closed , this beast of a man , so imposing , so imperial , and yet so quiet and boyish right now . “
131997	132025	131995	131995	Sam	560	” I cupped my mouth , rushing to the foot of the bed , sinking down to the floor and burying my face next to his arm . “
132041	132089	131995	131995	Sam	560	” Tears coated every inch of my face . I moaned loudly , howling , making noises I had no idea I was capable of . He was finally mine , and I was losing him . It was the sort of cruelty I could n’t fathom . “
132128	132163	132124	132124	gentleman	2749	” I huffed . I thought I felt him move slightly next to me , but he did n’t say anything , did n’t even groan , so obviously I was just imagining it . “
132225	132266	132213	132213	Hunter	615	” Another small movement . I jerked my head upright , studying Sam ’s face closely . His eyes were still shut , his breathing labored . I stared at him as I opened my mouth , cautiously speaking again . “
132311	132348	132305	132305	I	140	” Sam ’s hand moved slightly . He grabbed my wrist and tugged me to him , his eyes snapping open . He groaned in pain at the sudden movement and flashed me a canine scowl . “
132369	132411	132359	132359	Fitzpatrick	615	” Surprised , I stared at him with open delight . My ploy had worked . I pouted , leaning backward and giving him some space . His hold on my wrist tightened , but he was still so very weak . “
132432	132433	132434	132434	You	140	” “
132437	132444	132434	132434	You	140	” I hissed under my breath . “
132453	132454	132434	132434	You	140	” “
132485	132486	132487	132487	I	140	” “
132505	132524	132528	132528	sweetheart	140	” I explained , watching as his eyes shut again , his throat bobbing with a hard swallow . “
132530	132538	132525	132525	I	140	” His tone turned soft , scratchy . “
132546	132550	132525	132525	I	140	” I asked . “
132562	132563	132525	132525	I	140	” “
132566	132567	132525	132525	I	140	” “
132579	132580	132577	132577	Nix	140	” “
132591	132598	132586	132586	They	449	” I rubbed his uninjured arm . “
132610	132642	132599	132599	I	140	” He nodded then grunted again , realizing his mistake . Everything must ’ve hurt , and I made a mental note to ask the nurses to up his morphine dose . “
132658	132671	132599	132599	I	140	” I warned . His eyes were still closed when he asked , “
132674	132675	132599	132599	I	140	” “
132777	132778	132775	132775	me	140	” “
132788	132789	132775	132775	me	140	” “
132830	132847	132818	132818	I	140	” He opened his eyes , looking at me , surprised . His voice dropped low . “
132853	132854	132818	132818	I	140	” “
132857	132933	132934	132934	I	140	” I said simply . I had to do this . For him . For myself . For his family and our future children . If he cared more about a piece of Boston than he did about me , marrying him was going to be a mistake . I felt oddly reassured by that simple logic . We held each other ’s gaze , silent for a moment . His jaw ticked with annoyance . “
132940	132944	132934	132934	I	140	” he said . “
132951	132952	132945	132945	I	140	” “
132957	132958	132955	132955	Brookline	235	” “
132965	132984	132985	132985	I	140	” I shook my head , standing up from the floor , wiping my cheeks clean of tears . “
133017	133018	133021	133021	woman	1358	” “
133023	133037	133021	133021	woman	1358	” He turned his head sideways , closing his eyes , swallowing hard . “
133042	133069	133021	133021	woman	1358	” I knew how difficult it was for him to say this , to make this sacrifice . I leaned down and kissed his cheek softly . “
133083	133106	133073	133073	I	140	” Stepping backward and getting ready to leave , I turned around and heard his voice , sharp and cutting like glass . “
133118	133126	133073	133073	I	140	” he wondered , half in awe . “
133152	133174	133186	133188	a fucking amateur	2767	” I grinned , glancing at him from behind my shoulder . He shook his head , scowling at the wall . “
133179	133183	133184	133184	I	140	” I said . “
133190	133191	133184	133184	I	140	” “
133196	133207	133184	133184	I	140	” I laughed . He turned to glare at me . “
133330	133379	133323	133323	we	2772	” The idea that I was n’t the only one who waited to catch glimpses of him made my heart stutter . I walked back to him , gently placing my hand on his cheek . He curled his fingers over my arm , looking up at me . “
133412	133418	133419	133419	I	140	” I shook my head . “
133439	133440	133444	133444	Nix	140	” “
133446	133505	133444	133444	Nix	140	” He tugged me down to him . Our lips met . His were cold and dry and chapped , and I quivered , wanting to cry with what he ’d been through . I pressed feathery kisses around his mouth , chin , and neck , smiling down at him , kissing his forehead one last time . “
133510	133514	133515	133515	I	140	” I whispered . “
133521	133525	133515	133515	I	140	” Sam retorted . “
133540	133541	133528	133528	I	140	” “
133546	133687	133543	133543	you	1358	” I walked away , taking one last glance at him , knowing we were going to have a million more goodbyes . And a million more hellos , too . I ran to the waiting room , breaking the good news with a rush of stuttering words . Sparrow squealed and darted toward the room . My parents let out a relieved breath , though I was n’t entirely sure what my father was doing here in the first place . Was it the guilt of keeping us apart for all these years ? Cillian and Hunter were the only ones who did n’t look visibly delighted by the news . They glared at me hard as I rehashed the moment in which Sam woke up , obviously omitting the lovey - dovey stuff that would make them gag . “
133698	133711	133690	133690	Ash	133	” Hunter cleared his throat , throwing a glance at my parents . “
133714	133800	133690	133690	Ash	133	” He turned around before I could answer , marching down the hallway . Cillian followed him wordlessly . Frowning , I went after them , something cold and stony settling in my chest . This did n’t sound good . They stopped when we reached the junction between the elevators and the emergency exit , a good length away from our parents . They both turned to look at me . All I needed was one look to figure out that they knew everything . “
133810	133832	133808	133808	Aisling	463	” Cillian demanded , his voice like icicles dripping down my skin , causing goose bumps to rise in its wake . “
133931	133932	133919	133919	I	140	” “
133938	133943	133933	133933	You	2783	” Hunter pointed out . “
133968	134224	133919	133919	I	140	” I must have turned pale because even though they still looked at me like they wanted to kill me , they schooled their faces and stopped showering me with questions . I knew I had two options . Come clean and own up to what I did for almost a year or let them live with a half - assed lie . A lie would n’t be so harmful . After all , I quit . Still , I could n’t lie to them . Not again . My lies were piling up neatly on my conscience . Besides , I could no longer pretend to be someone I was n’t . Someone tailor - made for my family to ensure they were happy and fulfilled and proud of me . My parents . My brothers . My professors . Even the late Ms. B molded me into the woman she wanted me to become . No more . So I told them . I opened my mouth , and the truth came out . About Dr. Doyle . How we ’d met . About Ms. B ’s death and how it affected me . About the first time I saw Sam . How it was n’t the day the Fitzpatricks had invited him over along with the Brennans , but months before that . I told them I had quit . That I could n’t put myself at risk anymore to help others . That Sam bent my arm and would n’t budge . “
134237	134254	134257	134257	Ash	133	” Hunter mumbled , pulling me into a hug , pressing me close to his heart . “
134310	134311	134312	134312	He	1070	” “
134316	134321	134312	134312	He	1070	” Cillian said pithily . “
134339	134340	134330	134330	We	2785	” “
134343	134348	134350	134350	you	2786	” I looked between them “
134361	134362	134364	134364	you	2786	” “
134366	134372	134373	134373	You	2786	” Cillian lifted a brow . “
134397	134502	134503	134503	Nix	140	” Ten days later , I got out of the hospital . Aisling and Sparrow doted on my ass like I was a baby , fussing over me and checking on me every single hour , dropping my masculinity levels to new lows I was pretty sure only poodles with designer haircuts had suffered . The first two days , I humored them , mostly because I was trying to play nice with my fiancée . By day three , however , I made the executive decision to throw all the fucks the doctors had asked I give about my health out the window . “
134507	134539	134503	134503	Nix	140	” I caught her hand . It rested on my chest in our apartment — yes , our apartment — as she patted my forehead with a hot , wet cloth . “
134555	134568	134546	134546	I	140	” Her peacock eyes widened in horror , her rosebud mouth pouting . “
134574	134575	134569	134569	You	140	” “
134592	134593	134585	134585	I	140	” “
134604	134605	134606	134606	I	140	” “
134620	134665	134666	134666	We	2790	” I raised an eyebrow , my eyes dropping to the impressive bulge in my pants . No matter my physical state , whenever Aisling was in the room so was my need to fuck her through the mattress , floor , and earth . “
134673	134693	134666	134666	We	2790	” She withdrew her hand from mine , stepping back , standing in front of me in our bedroom . “
134709	134741	134699	134699	I	140	” I smiled impatiently . It was one thing to give up half my kingdom for her . It was quite a - fucking - nother to be happy about it . “
134766	134830	134762	134762	me	140	” I snapped my fingers toward the nightstand . She quirked an eyebrow , knotting her arms over her chest . She was my fiancée , not my soldier . I had a long way to go when it came to treating her like the princess that she was . Mostly because I ’d never had to treat anyone well my entire life . “
134837	134855	134762	134762	me	140	” I grinned wolfishly , and she picked my phone up , handing it over to me . “
134861	134872	134873	134873	Troy	952	” I already had the phone pressed to my ear . “
134875	134876	134873	134873	Troy	952	” “
134883	134884	134885	134885	You	2791	” “
134892	134893	134885	134885	You	2791	” “
134909	134936	134907	134907	you	2791	” She sighed but looked happy about it . I grabbed the hem of her dress and pulled her down for a filthy , deep kiss . “
134970	134995	134962	134962	I	140	” The following evening , Troy parked in front of Vasily Mikhailov ’s Russian deli in Brookline . He tossed me a doubtful look . “
135029	135030	135019	135019	I	140	” “
135041	135042	135019	135019	I	140	” “
135054	135055	135019	135019	I	140	” “
135079	135151	135068	135068	I	140	” I pushed the passenger door open , sliding out and cocking my gun as I did . I heard Troy doing the same behind me . We rounded his car , popping the trunk open . Vasily ’s daughter , Masha , blinked at the sudden light coming from behind our shoulders , her mouth gagged , her hands and feet tied together behind her back . I smiled cordially . “
135163	135182	135152	135153	Miss Mikhailov	395	” She murmured something hysterical around the fabric covering her mouth , but I could n’t distinguish it . “
135187	135191	135152	135153	Miss Mikhailov	395	” I asked . “
135226	135324	135218	135218	he	2963	” I hoisted her up over my shoulder , marching toward the deli . The bell above the deli ’s door chimed as we stepped inside . I aimed my gun toward the shop owner with my free hand , an elderly Russian man with a weather - beaten face marred with red and blue from years of braving the cold . Masha was still draped over my shoulder , like a pig on its way to slaughter , still dressed in the same expensive coat and designer heels she wore on her shopping spree this morning . “
135329	135358	135359	135359	I	140	” I clipped . The man ’s eyes flared at the sight in front of him . Masha thrashed desperately , trying to wriggle out of my hands . “
135363	135409	135359	135359	I	140	” he started , knowing full well he was not allowed to let people into the back office . That was where his boss was situated . I turned my aim from his head to Masha ’s spine , digging the gun into her bones . “
135462	135463	135452	135452	he	2798	” “
135468	135662	135663	135663	Brennan	952	” the man blurted out , jumping from his place behind the counter , rounding it and pushing an old wooden door open . The place smelled of pickles , dried meat , and smoke . I followed the man ’s back , Troy at my heels . After passing through a narrow , dusty corridor we reached another door . He opened it . Vasily was at his desk , surrounded by three of his high - ranked men . He had the pointy , fox - look of a comic book villain , which he highlighted with good suits and bad manners . But not even a fucking ball gown could hide the fact that his face was riddled with knife scars . My initials — S.A.B.—were carved into his forehead , jagged and white . His bodyguards were on alert , two on each side , all of them possessing the peculiar look of semitrailers and similar IQs . The middle - aged man with silver hair and pale blue eyes looked up at me , putting his cigar down in an ashtray , sending smoke whirling to the ceiling . “
135669	135670	135665	135665	You	952	” “
135676	135731	135665	135665	You	952	” I rearranged Masha on my shoulder . Even though I used my healthy shoulder to carry her and not the one his men put a bullet through , I still was n’t my usual self . Normally , carrying a woman of Masha ’s slight weight was akin to wearing a goddamn scarf . “
135740	135755	135665	135665	You	952	” Vasily ’s eyes slid from me to Troy , who stood beside me . “
135759	135764	135665	135665	You	952	” Troy clipped dryly , “
135789	135790	135787	135787	Vasily	1709	” “
135805	135813	135814	135814	My	140	” I tsked , shaking my head . “
135827	135900	135814	135814	My	140	” Masha twisted in my arms , responding to her father ’s words and tenor . I drugged her a little — enough to keep her silent and easy to manage — and I knew these animals were wondering if I used the opportunity to shove my dick in her , and maybe even arranged it so a Brennan bastard was inside her to ensure the Bratva could never touch me again . “
135906	135917	135814	135814	My	140	” Vasily demanded , darting up from his leather seat . “
135955	135959	135945	135945	She	685	” he growled . “
135965	135969	135970	135970	I	140	” I corrected . “
136012	136013	136034	136034	God	115	” “
136016	136027	136030	136030	her	685	” Vasily slapped a hand over his desk , seething . “
136038	136039	136030	136030	her	685	” “
136063	136073	136060	136060	your	2805	” I said flatly . Vasily ’s eyes narrowed . “
136087	136088	136083	136083	We	2812	” “
136098	136117	136091	136091	I	140	” I shrugged , and Masha moaned against my shoulder , weeping through the cloth covering her mouth . “
136157	136187	136191	136191	her	2805	” Vasily stroked his chin , considering my proposition . His men were ready for battle — I could tell by the way their muscles bunched under their shirts . “
136193	136207	136191	136191	her	2805	” he asked , his Russian accent thickly coating each word with worry . “
136210	136215	136216	136216	I	140	” I said honestly . “
136226	136280	136282	136282	her	2805	” I also prefer them to be just one woman — Aisling . I still could n’t believe she made me go through with this . Give up such a strategic part of Boston . Love was a bitch , but it was something I had to endure in order to keep Nix . “
136285	136315	136282	136282	her	2805	” Vasily repeated , his voice shaking slightly . In all the time I ’d known him , Vasily Mikhailov ’s voice had never wavered . He was scared . “
136318	136339	136282	136282	her	2805	” I hissed . He lowered his head , so close to defeat the despair was tangible in the air . “
136346	136347	136342	136342	your	2817	” “
136358	136359	136342	136342	your	2817	” “
136362	136384	136342	136342	your	2817	” he clipped , jotting down something on a piece of paper resting on his desk , already making the calculation . “
136393	136402	136391	136391	Mikhailov	1709	” I reminded him . He looked up . “
136410	136484	136489	136489	son	3063	” I put Masha on the floor . She flailed , her eyes erratically looking for her father among the shadows of people in the room . Vasily ran to her , crouching down and removing a knife from his Italian loafers . He began tearing the ropes that tied her together , whispering Russian endearments in her ear , his face contorted with emotion . Troy put a hand on my shoulder . “
136491	136492	136489	136489	son	3063	” “
136498	136558	136496	136496	Dad	221	” It was the first time I called him Dad , but I knew it was not going to be the last . I turned around and followed him , feeling him smiling , even with his back to me . For the first time since I was born , I felt something foreign and addictive . I belonged . “
136570	136625	136626	136626	She	2820	” My mother scooped her Hermes bag from the chapel ’s floor , her heels clicking provocatively as she sashayed outside . My father stood behind her , shrugging helplessly , a what - can - you - do expression on his face . Troy and Sparrow were behind them , gathering their belongings . “
136644	136676	136677	136677	I	140	” He kissed both my cheeks , giving Sam , who stood by my side , a firm handshake . Belle was the next person to slide out of her pew . “
136683	136698	136677	136677	I	140	” She bristled in delight , clutching my arms , shaking me a little . “
136706	136707	136677	136677	I	140	” “
136712	136744	136677	136677	I	140	” Persephone slid from the same pew , Cillian standing right next to her . Persy held her tummy , in which my next nephew or niece was cooking quite nicely . “
136750	136751	136752	136752	I	140	” “
136755	136766	136752	136752	I	140	” Sam cut harshly through everyone ’s coos and murmurs . “
136789	136790	136752	136752	I	140	” “
136796	136801	136804	136804	he	2822	” Cillian pointed out . “
136813	136828	136804	136804	he	2822	” Sailor ’s face popped out of nowhere . Hunter stood close to her . “
136880	136892	136871	136872	Prince William	367	” Sailor frowned , curling her fingers under her chin thoughtfully . “
136913	136940	136906	136906	my	140	” Devon interrupted , clearing his throat . The British man seemed so out of place at the cheesy chapel , I let out a giggle . “
136948	136956	136941	136941	We	2824	” I bit down on my lip . “
136988	136989	136992	136992	her	124	” “
136995	137063	136990	136990	I	140	” Sam delivered the news flatly , no hint of emotions in his voice . I whipped my head toward him , shocked that he let our secret out and grateful that my parents were n’t in our vicinity anymore . Sam kept his eyes on our friends , not me , while I very possibly blushed myself into an early grave inside my respectable white dress . “
137081	137082	137075	137075	my	140	” “
137088	137101	137085	137085	you	2825	” Persy frowned , her hand moving in circles around her belly . “
137107	137115	137085	137085	you	2825	” Belle interfered , keeping it blunt . “
137159	137160	137119	137122	cheap - ass johnnies	2826	” “
137163	137167	137119	137122	cheap - ass johnnies	2826	” Hunter laughed , “
137178	137179	137180	137180	I	140	” “
137193	137198	137180	137180	I	140	” Cillian inquired tersely . “
137218	137219	137215	137216	the family	1114	” “
137224	137228	137229	137229	I	140	” Hunter snorted . “
137248	137249	137250	137250	Hunter	615	” “
137252	137285	137250	137250	Hunter	615	” Everyone shrieked in unison , other than Emmabelle , who laughed , enjoying herself , and Devon , who was too busy staring at Belle to care what everyone was saying . “
137290	137296	137297	137297	I	140	” I shook my head . “
137330	137439	137323	137323	I	140	” I grinned , looking up at Sam while he pressed a proud kiss to my forehead . Two months after Sam told Vasily Mikhailov he could have Brookline back , we went out to celebrate the fact I got accepted to a nearby hospital to begin my residency . It was my favorite Thai place , and even though we had a wonderful time , I went to bed feeling ill . When I woke up the next morning , I puked my guts out and figured something must have upset my stomach . But then it happened the morning after . And after . And after . “
137450	137477	137323	137323	I	140	” Sam had questioned when I closed in on a week of throwing up each morning and feeling miraculously better during the rest of the day . “
137496	137522	137523	137523	I	140	” I ’d scrunched my nose , thinking about it . My cycles were pretty regular , and besides , I was on the pill . “
137529	137535	137523	137523	I	140	” I ’d said finally . “
137545	137552	137523	137523	I	140	” Sam had raised an eyebrow . “
137555	137585	137523	137523	I	140	” I ’d winced , but deep down I knew there would n’t be one part of me that would be upset if I found out I was pregnant . “
137597	137598	137523	137523	I	140	” “
137602	137774	137775	137775	I	140	” And here we were a week later , married in Vegas in front of our closest friends and family . I ’d always imagined having a grand , fancy wedding , but as soon as I realized I was pregnant , I knew a massive wedding was n’t what I wanted . It was simply what was expected of me . What I really wanted was to be married to the man of my dreams as soon as humanly possible . The man who had given me a new ferret for my last birthday and did n’t even look surprised or put off by the fact I had named it Shelly , after my previous ferret . Besides , as Sam had pointed out , he won our marriage in a card game . It was only fitting we would get married in the gambling capital of the world . The symmetry of the narrative pleased me . Two monsters , promising their lives to one another in Sin City . “
137805	137855	137856	137856	Sam	560	” Sailor laughed , side - eyeing her brother knowingly . I looked up to my husband and noticed the sly smile on his face . He could n’t have . He would n’t … would he ? Cocking my head slightly , I narrowed my eyes at him . “
137858	137871	137872	137872	I	140	” I asked . My husband pressed a kiss to my mouth . “
137877	137912	137874	137875	the fixer	2834	” was all he said , keeping it at that . I had never told anyone what the last thing Ms. B told me right after she demanded I stop visiting to help her . “
137966	138023	137959	137959	he	2835	” I opened my eyes , looked up at my husband of ten minutes , and smiled . I feared no evil . But I did fall in love with one . Four months later . Cillian dropped his cards on the table in Badland ’s card room , glancing at his phone with a frown . “
138028	138029	138030	138030	You	560	” “
138034	138046	138047	138047	You	560	” Hunter echoed , eyeing his older brother with apparent shock . “
138052	138053	138047	138047	You	560	” “
138063	138099	138100	138100	Your	560	” Cillian tossed his cards onto Hunter ’s lap , his shoulder brushing mine as I leaned over the table to grab another card . Cillian stopped to raise his finger toward me in warning . “
138141	138273	138301	138301	sis	615	” He made a quick exit before I could respond that nothing could persuade me a pregnant Aisling was a bad idea . Nix had never been hornier in her entire fucking life . I was on - call three times a day for dick duty , even though she was still working long hours at the hospital most days . She also turned out to have a sweet tooth , which meant I had to feed her candy and chocolate whenever her heart desired . At night , I ’d slip under the covers next to her and press my hand to her swollen stomach , feeling my son kicking up a storm . He was so alive and happy inside her , I could n’t wait to meet him . “
138303	138346	138301	138301	sis	615	” I heard Cillian drawl behind my back . I turned around to find Nix standing there just as Cillian bent to kiss her on the cheek , her belly poking out in her scrubs , a tired smile on her face . “
138354	138401	138352	138352	Brennan	952	” She offered me a hand , drawing curious glances from all the men around us . I very rarely stayed at Badlands after dark these days , and when I did , it was mostly to keep my brothers - in - law in check . “
138407	138413	138352	138352	Brennan	952	” I eyed her skeptically . “
138430	138456	138423	138423	I	140	” She sauntered toward me , a taunting smirk on her face , and bent toward my ear . The whole room held its breath . “
138476	138488	138467	138467	I	140	” she whispered . Nix leaned backward , straightening her back . “
138494	138510	138511	138511	I	140	” I asked nonchalantly . She was n’t going to win . I always won . “
138539	138540	138532	138532	I	140	” “
138554	138584	138532	138532	I	140	” Hunter coughed into his fist in the background , drawing laughter . Aisling offered me her hand again , staring at me under her soot - black eyelashes . “
