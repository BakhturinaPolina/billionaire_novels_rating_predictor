31	31	33	36	Edna St. Vincent Millay	90	”
178	188	189	189	I	3485	“ Please do n’t leave , Auntie . Please , ”
369	372	373	373	She	473	“ Leave ? ”
376	412	373	373	She	473	“ Oh , my , that ’s a big word . I ’d never do that , Persy . Dead , alive , and in - between , I will always be there for you . ”
413	417	418	418	I	3485	“ But how ? ”
429	444	418	418	I	3485	“ How will I know you ’re really here after your body is gone ? ”
445	477	373	373	She	473	“ Just turn your face up , you silly goose . The sky will always be ours . That ’s where we ’ll meet , between the sunrays and the clouds . ”
601	609	610	610	I	3485	“ Will you give me a sign ? ”
613	640	610	610	I	3485	“ That you ’re there in the sky ? A lightning ? Rain ? Oh , I know ! Maybe a pigeon can poop on me . ”
668	675	676	677	my aunt	473	“ Let ’s make a deal , ”
683	784	676	677	my aunt	473	“ As you know , clouds are more reliable than shooting stars . Common , but still magical . When the time comes and you grow up , ask for something you want — something you really want — when you see a lone cloud in the sky , and I will grant it to you . That ’s how you ’ll know I ’m there watching . You only get one miracle , Persephone , so be careful what you wish for . But I promise , whatever your wish may be — I will grant it to you . ”
1501	1515	1568	1568	I	3485	“ Auntie Tilda , fancy seeing you here ! How ’ve you been ? ”
1549	1567	1536	1536	I	3485	“ Weather ’s looking fine . Sailor is going to appreciate it . How do I look ? ”
1589	1597	1568	1568	I	3485	“ Think he ’ll finally notice me ? ”
1753	1770	1750	1750	I	3485	“ I know , I know , I should just get over him . Move on . ”
1784	1810	1771	1771	I	3485	“ There ’s a fine line between being a romantic and a moron . I think I ’ve straddled it about four years too long . ”
2166	2169	2174	2174	Emmabelle	3320	“ Pers ? ”
2186	2201	2176	2176	Belle	485	“ The ceremony starts in twenty minutes . What ’s taking you so long ? ”
2220	2265	2204	2204	Belle	485	“ You better get your ass in gear . Our girl has already puked in the limo ’s trash can twice , cursed the groom like a pirate for not eloping in Vegas , and one of her acrylic nails is playing Amelia Earhart . ”
2266	2272	2273	2273	I	3485	“ How do you mean ? ”
2282	2293	2294	2294	I	3485	“ It ’s disappeared . Hopefully not in her hairdo . ”
2304	2357	2294	2294	I	3485	“ Oh , by the way . Can you bring Hunter ’s ring if his brother does n’t show up to take it ? Technically , it ’s Cillian ’s job , but he ’s probably in the gardens , skinning a female employee and making fashionable coats out of her flesh . ”
2370	2382	2358	2358	Cillian	142	“ Roger that . I ’ll be there in five minutes . ”
2427	2429	2426	2426	Aisling	106	“ Ash ”
2499	2502	2503	2503	I	3485	“ Bingo . ”
2540	2546	2547	2547	My	3485	“ Five minutes , Belle . ”
2557	2568	2547	2547	My	3485	“ And yeah , I remember , Hunter ’s ring … ”
2596	2598	2599	2599	Fitzpatrick	142	“ Kill ”
2887	2890	2891	2891	I	3485	“ Cillian , ”
2895	2902	2891	2891	I	3485	“ Hello . Hey . Hi . ”
2984	2994	2968	2968	His	142	“ Three minutes until the limo leaves , Penrose . ”
3000	3004	2968	2968	His	142	“ Thank you . ”
3026	3031	3032	3032	I	3485	“ Are you excited ? ”
3112	3115	3116	3116	I	3485	“ Wait ! ”
3129	3136	3119	3119	He	142	“ I need … I need … ”
3143	3161	3119	3119	He	142	“ I need you to call an ambulance . I think I ’m having an allergic reaction . ”
3315	3327	3300	3300	he	142	“ Not much going on inside that pretty head , huh ? ”
3490	3495	3496	3496	I	3485	“ What are you — ”
3499	3504	3505	3505	He	142	“ Do n’t worry . ”
3532	3542	3505	3505	He	142	“ My tastes do n’t run to little girls . ”
3587	3595	3596	3596	I	3485	“ What the hell did you do ? ”
3599	3604	3605	3605	he	142	“ You ’re poisoned , ”
3619	3624	3605	3605	he	142	“ I ’m what ? ”
3688	3699	3700	3700	I	3485	“ I found them in the garden outside the suite , ”
3715	3722	3700	3700	I	3485	“ I tasted them , too . ”
3723	3729	3730	3730	His	142	“ Of course you would . ”
3776	3786	3787	3787	he	142	“ I ’m going to make you throw up , ”
3877	3884	3885	3885	I	3485	“ What ’re they , anywhmm ? ”
3896	3900	3885	3885	I	3485	“ The flowers . ”
3979	3993	3956	3956	he	142	“ Bleeding Hearts . Known for being beautiful , rare , and toxic . ”
3994	3999	4000	4000	I	3485	“ Just like you , ”
4018	4030	3956	3956	he	142	“ You were about to poison an entire chapel , Emmalynne . ”
4031	4036	4037	4037	My	3485	“ I ’m Persephone . ”
4062	4074	4049	4049	I	3485	“ And my sister ’s name is Emmabelle , not Emmalynne . ”
4075	4080	4081	4081	he	142	“ Are you sure ? ”
4100	4112	4081	4081	he	142	“ I do n’t remember the younger one being so mouthy . ”
4126	4144	4145	4145	I	3485	“ Am I sure I am who I am , or what my sister ’s name is ? ”
4158	4171	4145	4145	I	3485	“ Either way , the answer is yes . I ’m positive . ”
4253	4261	4239	4239	Kill	3067	“ On my lap , Flower Girl . ”
4262	4265	4239	4239	Kill	3067	“ No . ”
4266	4279	4239	4239	Kill	3067	“ The word should n’t even be in your vocabulary with me . ”
4280	4289	4290	4290	My	3485	“ Turns out I ’m full of surprises . ”
4362	4371	4372	4372	I	3485	“ I do n’t care if I die , ”
4375	4394	4372	4372	I	3485	“ Ditto , sweetheart . Unfortunately , you ’ll have to do it on someone else ’s watch . ”
4449	4453	4454	4454	He	559	“ Stay still . ”
4639	4643	4644	4644	I	3485	“ Thank you , ”
4675	4688	4689	4689	He	559	“ Do n’t move . Your bath should be ready any minute . ”
4726	4731	4732	4732	He	559	“ So . Persephone . ”
4753	4784	4732	4732	He	559	“ Did your parents know you were going to be insufferable and punished you in advance with a stripper ’s name , or were they on a Greek mythology kick ? ”
4785	4829	4833	4833	they	561	“ My Auntie Tilda named me . She battled breast cancer , on and off . The week I was born , she got the all clear after her first round of chemo . My mother let her name me as a present . ”
4869	4876	4877	4877	Cillian	142	“ They could n’t say no . ”
4885	4891	4877	4877	Cillian	142	“ I love my name . ”
4892	4897	4877	4877	Cillian	142	“ It ’s tacky . ”
4898	4903	4877	4877	Cillian	142	“ It means something . ”
4904	4909	4877	4877	Cillian	142	“ Nothing means anything . ”
4927	4935	4910	4910	I	3485	“ Whatever you say , Dr. Seuss . ”
4974	4981	4982	4982	He	142	“ Lady - in - bath . ”
5005	5015	5016	5016	he	142	“ That ’s another name for the bleeding heart , ”
5020	5024	5016	5016	he	142	“ Get in . ”
5186	5191	5192	5192	I	3485	“ I want you . ”
5275	5282	5283	5283	I	3485	“ I ’ve always wanted you , ”
5308	5333	5283	5283	I	3485	“ Sometimes I want you so much it hurts to breathe . Sometimes the pain from breathing is a nice distraction from wanting you . ”
5361	5374	5375	5375	She	106	“ You said you needed my extra gown ? Why on earth … ”
5392	5402	5388	5388	Her	106	“ Holy Mother Mary . Did you two … ? ”
5403	5410	5411	5411	Cillian	142	“ Not in a million years , ”
5423	5436	5411	5411	Cillian	142	“ Stall the limo . She ’ll be down in five minutes . ”
5535	5539	5524	5524	Kill	3067	“ Dry up . ”
5568	5576	5577	5577	I	3485	“ I do n’t want your help , ”
5592	5601	5577	5577	I	3485	“ I do n’t care what you want . ”
5752	5758	5759	5759	I	3485	“ You ’re hurting me , ”
5773	5785	5759	5759	I	3485	“ That ’s what you get for having a bleeding heart . ”
5786	5793	5759	5759	I	3485	“ The flower , or organ ? ”
5794	5812	5759	5759	I	3485	“ Both . One is a fast poison . The other slow , but just as destructive . ”
5911	5929	5930	5930	My	3485	“ You were n’t going to help me . You were going to leave me to die . ”
5945	5950	5936	5936	I	3485	“ Why did you ? ”
5951	5959	5930	5930	My	3485	“ A poisoned bridesmaid makes bad press . ”
5960	5968	5969	5969	I	3485	“ And they say chivalry is dead , ”
5973	5991	5992	5992	He	142	“ Chivalry might be dead , but you ’re not , so shut up and be grateful . ”
6052	6055	6049	6049	I	3485	“ Thanks . ”
6069	6075	6076	6076	I	3485	“ For being a gentleman , ”
6086	6095	6049	6049	I	3485	“ I ’m no gentleman , Flower Girl . ”
6198	6209	6162	6162	I	3485	“ I wish you ’d fall in love with me . ”
6252	6326	6327	6327	I	3485	“ I wish you ’d fall in love with me so hard you wo n’t be able to think about anything else . To eat . To breathe . When my Aunt Tilda died , she granted me one miracle . This is the wish I choose . Your love . There ’s a world beyond your ice walls , Cillian Fitzpatrick , and it is full of laughter and joy and warmth . ”
6339	6361	6327	6327	I	3485	“ I ’m going to pay back your favor . I ’m going to save your life in my own way . ”
6502	6619	6496	6496	his	142	“ Listen to me carefully , Persephone , because I will only say it once . You are going to walk out of this room and forget you know me , just as I ’ve failed to notice your existence thus far . You will meet a nice , sane , boring guy . A perfect fit for your nice , sane , boring self . You ’ll get married to him , have his babies , and thank your lucky stars I was n’t horny enough to take you up on your less than subtle offer . I ’m giving you the gift of turning you down . Take it and run for the hills . ”
6664	6671	6672	6672	I	3485	“ Why do you hate me ? ”
6688	6692	6693	6693	He	580	“ Hate you ? ”
6704	6737	6693	6693	He	580	“ I have no feelings , Persephone . Not for you . Not at all . I am incapable of hating you . But I will also never , ever love you . ”
6905	6914	6923	6924	Colin Byrne	133	“ Mrs. Veitch . Fancy seeing you here . ”
6943	6949	6950	6950	I	3485	“ It ’s Miss Penrose . ”
7037	7056	7019	7019	Byrne	133	“ Penrose ? Nah , that ’s not the name on your driver ’s license , Persy baby . ”
7057	7064	7065	7065	I	3485	“ I asked for a divorce . ”
7077	7132	7019	7019	Byrne	133	“ Well , I asked for a threesome with Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift . Looks like we both ai n’t getting our wish , doll . The fact of the matter is , you ’re married to Paxton Veitch , and Paxton Veitch owes me money . A shit - ton of it . ”
7133	7140	7141	7141	I	3485	“ Exactly . Paxton owes you , ”
7162	7191	7158	7158	He	133	“ He was the one placing those bets . He was the one losing money at your joints . It ’s his mess to fix , not mine . ”
7302	7324	7325	7325	Byrne	133	“ Pax ’s long gone now , and his pretty wife refuses to let me know where I can find him . ”
7339	7349	7350	7350	I	3485	“ His wife does n’t know where he is . ”
7361	7376	7350	7350	I	3485	“ But she does know how to use pepper spray . Personal space here . ”
7474	7484	7485	7485	Byrne	133	“ Use your fine investigative skills to find out , ”
7488	7520	7485	7485	Byrne	133	“ After all , you managed to catch the lousiest husband in New England . You found him before , and you can do it again . Have a little faith . ”
7521	7565	7566	7566	I	3485	“ We both know I have n’t the greenest clue where to start looking . His phone is dead , my emails are bouncing back , and his friends wo n’t talk to me . It ’s not like I have n’t tried . ”
7592	7623	7624	7624	Byrne	133	“ Then I ’m afraid his debt is now yours . Whatever happened to in sickness and in health ? For richer or poorer ? How does the oath go ? ”
7643	7660	7633	7633	Kaminski	134	“ Beats me , Boss . Never got hitched . Ai n’t planning to , either . ”
7661	7665	7633	7633	Kaminski	134	“ Smart man . ”
7779	7884	7766	7766	He	134	“ Sorry , Persephone . It ’s nothing personal . I have a debt to collect , and if I do n’t collect it soon , people are going to assume it ’s okay to take money from me without paying me back . If you ’re interested in reimbursing me through a different currency , I can stitch together a plan . I ’m not an unreasonable man . But no matter how you look at it — you will pay your husband ’s debt , and you better hurry , because the interest is stacking up nicely as the weeks tick by . ”
7885	7891	7892	7892	My	3485	“ What are you insinuating ? ”
7978	7999	8031	8032	that bitch	604	“ I ’m saying if you ca n’t pay the outstanding balance , you ’ll have to work for it . ”
8000	8008	8009	8009	I	3485	“ Just spit it out , Byrne , ”
8061	8076	8077	8077	Colin	133	“ Serving men who are less than hygienic and not much to look at . ”
8081	8097	8098	8098	He	133	“ You ’re a good - looking gal , Veitch , even in those rags . ”
8109	8130	8098	8098	He	133	“ Six months working in my strip club doing double shifts every day , and we can call it even . ”
8131	8142	8143	8143	I	3485	“ I ’ll die before I dance on a pole , ”
8197	8204	8205	8205	he	133	“ You wo n’t be dancing , ”
8214	8251	8205	8205	he	133	“ You ’ll be on your back in the VIP room . Although I ca n’t promise you wo n’t be on your hands and knees , too , if they ’re willing to pay extra . ”
8426	8434	8435	8435	My	3485	“ What if I do n’t pay ? ”
8501	8555	8493	8493	he	133	“ Then I ’ll have to make an example out of you . Which , I assure you , Mrs. Veitch , would hurt me more than it would you . It is always a sad state of affairs when the wife has to take on the burden of her husband ’s mistakes . ”
8574	8615	8556	8556	He	133	“ But if I let this slide , I ’ll lose my street cred . You will pay . Either in money , with the thing between your legs , or with your blood . Catch you later , Persy . ”
8774	8787	8788	8788	Belle	485	“ Pers ? Jeez , dude . There ’s a thunderstorm outside . ”
8992	9027	9028	9028	I	3485	“ Sorry about that . Shannon ’s parents went to a drive - in and must ’ve gotten carried away . I did n’t even know drive - ins still existed . Did you ? ”
9149	9207	9208	9208	She	622	“ Drive - ins ? Sure . Some of my favorite sexcapades happened at the Solano drive - in . But it ’s been raining so hard , I doubt they could watch anything there . You really should ’ve called me . I ’d have picked you up . You know tonight is my night off . ”
9267	9276	9249	9249	Binge	146	“ You already do too much for me . ”
9277	9298	9249	9249	Binge	146	“ That ’s because that bastard , Pax , screwed you over . Remind me why you married him again ? ”
9299	9302	9249	9249	Binge	146	“ Love ? ”
9325	9334	9314	9314	I	3485	“ I thought I was respecting our pact . ”
9787	9795	9796	9796	Belle	485	“ You still believe in that bitch ? ”
9815	9819	9820	9820	I	3485	“ In what ? ”
9853	9856	9857	9857	Belle	485	“ Love . ”
9863	9886	9857	9857	Belle	485	“ Do you still believe in love after Pax took a dump all over the concept , then set it on fire ? ”
9887	9890	9891	9891	I	3485	“ Yeah . ”
9904	9909	9891	9891	I	3485	“ Pathetic , right ? ”
9916	9922	9910	9911	My sister	485	“ Wanna talk about it ? ”
9928	9934	9923	9923	I	3485	“ Wanna drink about it ? ”
9941	9950	9938	9938	She	485	“ I ’ll heat some pizza , too . ”
9980	9987	9938	9938	She	485	“ Pizza sounds great . Thanks . ”
10017	10020	10021	10021	I	3485	“ Belle ? ”
10026	10029	10030	10030	She	485	“ Hmm ? ”
10047	10059	10060	10060	I	3485	“ What do you think is going to happen with Pax ? ”
10078	10107	10060	10060	I	3485	“ I ca n’t stay married to him forever , right ? I ’ll be relieved from this marriage at some point if he does n’t show up ? ”
10127	10193	10108	10108	Belle	485	“ Well , marriage is not a public restroom . I ’m not sure you can be relieved from it , but you for sure can get out of this if you put your mind to it . The man has n’t been around in almost a year . You need to save up , get a good lawyer , and finish with this mess . ”
10203	10217	10218	10219	my sister	485	“ You ’ll have to do it at some point , you know , ”
10226	10236	10218	10219	my sister	485	“ Seek legal help . Take the bastard down . ”
10237	10242	10243	10243	I	3485	“ With what money ? ”
10246	10265	10243	10243	I	3485	“ And please , do n’t offer me another loan . I ’m just going to refuse it . ”
10337	10376	10377	10377	Her	151	“ Let ’s say you ’re too proud to take money from me — your own sister , mind you — and still want legal representation . I would just go to Sailor and ask for a loan . ”
10384	10439	10377	10377	Her	151	“ The Fitzpatricks have enough fuck - you money to build a dick - shaped statue the size of Lady Liberty . Sailor wo n’t be hard - pressed to get it back , you ’ll have zero interest , and she knows you ’re good for it . You ’ll pay it eventually . ”
10440	10445	10446	10446	I	3485	“ I ca n’t . ”
10451	10454	10455	10455	She	151	“ Why ? ”
10487	10509	10483	10483	I	3485	“ Eat the whole thing , Pers . You ’re skin and bones . Mom thinks you have an eating disorder . ”
10510	10519	10520	10520	I	3485	“ I do n’t have an eating disorder . ”
10528	10580	10523	10523	Belle	485	“ Bitch , I know . Your ass inhaled three Cheesecake Factory meals just eight months ago and washed it all down with margaritas , Tums , and regret . You ’re going through something , and I want you to snap out of it . Ask Sailor for the money ! ”
10581	10586	10587	10587	I	3485	“ Are you insane ? ”
10596	10614	10587	10587	I	3485	“ She does n’t have time for my drama . She just told us she was pregnant . ”
10665	10668	10669	10669	Belle	485	“ And ? ”
10674	10693	10669	10669	Belle	485	“ She can be preggo and give you money , you know . Women are known for multitasking . ”
10694	10712	10732	10733	my sister	485	“ She ’ll get worried . Plus , I do n’t want to be that loser friend . ”
10713	10722	10669	10669	Belle	485	“ It ’s just a few thousand dollars . ”
10750	10815	10816	10816	Cillian	142	“ At least think about it . Even if it feels weird for you to turn to Sailor and Hunter , that sociopath Cillian would give you the money . Sure , he ’d make you sweat for it — I swear , that asshole is as annoying as his face is sitable — but you ’ll walk out of there with the money . ”
11066	11068	11069	11069	Fitzpatrick	142	“ Kill ”
11255	11273	11274	11276	The malnourished PA	667	“ Sorry , sweetie , I do n’t think seeing Mr. Fitzpatrick is in your cards today . ”
11427	11438	11419	11419	she	667	“ Hiiiiiii , Mr. Fitzpatrick . This is Casey Brandt . ”
11441	11452	11419	11419	she	667	“ Your assistant for the past two years , sir . ”
11455	11462	11463	11463	She	667	“ Yeah ! With the pink . ”
11466	11484	11463	11463	She	667	“ Totes sorry to bother you , but I have Miss Persephone Penrose here without an appointment . ”
11487	11510	11511	11511	I	3485	“ She said she needs to talk to you urgently , but , like , refused to give me any further information ? ”
11555	11582	11530	11531	his PA	157	“ Yes , I know it is my job to get the information out of her . Unfortunately , she ’s been most uncooperative , sir . ”
11585	11596	11597	11597	She	157	“ Yes , sir . I ’ll let her know . ”
11617	11630	11597	11597	She	157	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick can not seem to fit you in his schedule . ”
11631	11643	11644	11644	My	3485	“ Tell him I ’m not leaving until he sees me . ”
11684	11693	11676	11676	I	3485	“ Go on , give him my answer . ”
11705	11719	11666	11666	She	157	“ He said he ’s in a meeting that will likely last hours . ”
11720	11729	11666	11666	She	157	“ That ’s okay . I have time . ”
11786	11797	11798	11798	she	157	“ I need to go to the ladies ’ room , ”
11826	11829	11830	11830	I	3485	“ Oh ? ”
11834	11871	11830	11830	I	3485	“ Are you not fully potty - trained ? You know , I ’m a pre - K teacher . Accidents do n’t faze me in the least . Need help in the big girl toilet ? ”
11879	11897	11898	11898	She	157	“ Do n’t go anywhere , unless it ’s back to the trailer park you came from . ”
11909	11913	11898	11898	She	157	“ Or hell . ”
12089	12140	12176	12177	the man	138	“ … stocks going up , but I still noticed a trend in negative press . Saying the media does n’t like you would be an understatement . It ’d be like saying the ocean is damp . That the sun is lukewarm . That Megan Fox is merely shagable … ”
12141	12149	12150	12150	Cillian	142	“ I get the gist of it , ”
12153	12161	12150	12150	Cillian	142	“ How do we rectify the situation ? ”
12162	12175	12176	12177	the man	138	“ I suppose a personality transplant would be out of the question ? ”
12180	12205	12206	12207	Tough crowd	692	“ The only thing that ’s about to be transplanted is my foot in your ass if you do n’t give me a solution . ”
12219	12225	12226	12228	the posh man	138	“ Bloody hell , Cillian , ”
12231	12261	12226	12228	the posh man	138	“ you started your CEO journey by sacking nine percent of the company ’s management and drilling holes in the Arctic . You have n’t exactly won any fans . ”
12262	12268	12206	12207	Tough crowd	692	“ I trimmed the fat . ”
12269	12353	12226	12228	the posh man	138	“ People rather like fat . The fast food industry rolls 256 billion dollars in revenue each year . Did you know that ? The people you fired talked to journalists , adding fuel to the fire and making you truly one of the country ’s worst villains . Royal Pipelines is already considered the most hated company in the US . The refinery explosion in Maine , the Green Living climate rally where an eighteen - year - old broke both legs — ”
12354	12365	12366	12366	Cillian	142	“ I was n’t the one who broke her legs , ”
12374	12377	12366	12366	Cillian	142	“ Unfortunately . ”
12378	12413	12414	12415	The man	138	“ No matter how you spin it , you must clean up your act . Play their game . Promote a wholesome , jolly image . The company ’s reputation needs to be restored . ”
12454	12477	12478	12478	Cillian	142	“ Fine . I ’ll kiss a few babies . Sponsor some students . Donate funds to open a new hospital wing . ”
12497	12516	12478	12478	Cillian	142	“ I ’m afraid we ’re quite past the kissing babies stage . It ’s time , Kill . ”
12523	12544	12517	12517	Cillian	142	“ I will not sacrifice my personal life to pacify a few self - righteous , Tesla - driving pricks — ”
12545	12554	12555	12555	I	3485	“ Cillian ? I mean , Mr. Fitzpatrick ? ”
12651	12659	12638	12638	My	3485	“ I did n’t mean to interrupt — ”
12660	12665	12666	12666	he	696	“ Yet you did , ”
12672	12685	12666	12666	he	696	“ Sorry about that . May I have a word with you ? ”
12686	12689	12690	12690	he	696	“ No , ”
12694	12699	12638	12638	My	3485	“ It ’s important . ”
12700	12705	12706	12706	He	696	“ Not to me . ”
12718	12738	12706	12706	He	696	“ Which Penrose sister are you ? The older and loud one , or the young and annoying one ? ”
12802	12807	12808	12808	I	3485	“ I ’m Persephone . ”
12846	12854	12871	12871	He	696	“ That does n’t answer my question . ”
12855	12858	12859	12859	I	3485	“ Fine , ”
12863	12870	12859	12859	I	3485	“ I ’m the annoying one . ”
12887	12893	12871	12871	He	696	“ What do you want ? ”
12894	12904	12871	12871	He	696	“ To speak with you in private , please . ”
12905	12942	12871	12871	He	696	“ Barging into my office unannounced is otiose . Expecting me not to kick you out implies you got your degree at the local Sam ’s Club . Spill it . Mr. Whitehall is my lawyer . ”
12943	12950	12951	12951	I	3485	“ Lawyers are people , too , ”
12963	12966	12967	12970	The gorgeous blond man	702	“ Debatable . ”
12974	12978	12979	12979	He	702	“ And actually … ”
13000	13020	12979	12979	He	702	“ I have better things to do than watch you two engaging in verbal foreplay . Cheers , Kill . ”
13064	13070	13071	13071	I	3485	“ May I come in ? ”
13174	13191	13192	13192	He	142	“ You have exactly ten , no , make it five minutes before I call security . ”
13200	13214	13192	13192	He	142	“ Give me the elevator pitch , Flower Girl . Make it good . ”
13221	13231	13218	13218	He	142	“ You ’re going to call security on me ? ”
13232	13253	13254	13254	He	142	“ My to - do list is long , and my patience is short . Four and a half minutes . ”
13331	13351	13326	13326	Cillian	142	“ You managed to cram all of this in under three minutes . Maybe you ’re not completely useless . ”
13386	13403	13376	13376	She	157	“ Gosh , I ’m so sorry , Mr. Fitzpatrick . She promised she would n’t … ”
13404	13410	13411	13411	Cillian	142	“ Miss Brandt , leave , ”
13414	13418	13376	13376	She	157	“ But I — ”
13419	13427	13376	13376	She	157	“ Save it for someone who cares . ”
13428	13431	13376	13376	She	157	“ I — ”
13432	13439	13376	13376	She	157	“ That someone is n’t me . ”
13440	13451	13376	13376	She	157	“ Sir , I just wanted you to know that — ”
13452	13494	13376	13376	She	157	“ The only thing I know is you failed at your job and will be assessed accordingly . You ’re leaving in the next three seconds , either through the door or the window . Friendly advice : choose the door . ”
13530	13541	13542	13542	I	3485	“ You just threatened to throw Barbie out the window . ”
13549	13556	13557	13557	he	142	“ Not threatened , heavily implied , ”
13560	13576	13557	13557	he	142	“ You have less than two minutes , and I have about five hundred questions . ”
13587	13592	13557	13557	he	142	“ That ’s fair . ”
13593	13620	13557	13557	he	142	“ One — why me ? Why not Hunter , Sailor , or anyone who actually gives half a damn about you , pardon my forwardness ? ”
13674	13769	13667	13667	I	3485	“ Sailor and Hunter do n’t know what Paxton did , and they ’re the only people I ’m close with who actually have this kind of money . They know Pax left me and took the money we ’d saved , but they do n’t know about the debt . I do n’t want to taint my friendship with my best friend by putting her in this position . I figured you and I share no history , no ties . With us , it will be a business transaction and nothing more . ”
13770	13776	13777	13777	Sam	2667	“ Why not Sam Brennan ? ”
13826	13852	13853	13853	I	3485	“ Mixing up with Brennan to try to pay back a street loan shark is like cutting off your arm because you broke your nail , ”
13857	13867	13853	13853	I	3485	“ You think I ’m less dangerous than Brennan ? ”
13877	13880	13881	13881	I	3485	“ No . ”
13887	13915	13881	13881	I	3485	“ But I think you ’d be entertained by watching me squirm as I pay you back , and therefore more likely to give me the money . ”
13937	13947	13916	13916	His	718	“ Where ’s that useless husband of yours now ? ”
13948	13974	13976	13976	him	718	“ I do n’t know . Trust me , if I did , I ’d have chased him to the end of earth and back . ”
13983	13994	13995	13995	Kill	3067	“ How are you planning to pay this loan back ? ”
14007	14010	13995	13995	Kill	3067	“ Slowly . ”
14019	14058	13995	13995	Kill	3067	“ I ’m a pre - K teacher , but I moonlight as a babysitter and tutor first and second graders . I ’ll work tirelessly until I pay you back every penny . You have my word . ”
14059	14087	13995	13995	Kill	3067	“ Your word does n’t mean anything . I do n’t know you . Which brings me to my final question — why should I help you ? ”
14142	14148	14149	14149	He	142	“ Thirty seconds , Persephone . ”
14157	14162	14149	14149	He	142	“ Because you can ? ”
14163	14177	14178	14178	He	142	“ The number of things I can do with my money is infinite . ”
14181	14191	14192	14192	I	3485	“ Because it ’s the right thing to do ! ”
14211	14217	14149	14149	He	142	“ I ’m a nihilist . ”
14218	14227	14228	14228	I	3485	“ I do n’t know what that means . ”
14239	14256	14257	14257	he	142	“ Right or wrong are the same side of the coin for me , presented differently , ”
14261	14269	14257	14257	he	142	“ I have no morals or principles . ”
14270	14281	14149	14149	He	142	“ That ’s the saddest thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
14282	14285	14286	14286	He	142	“ Really ? ”
14301	14334	14286	14286	He	142	“ The saddest thing I ’ve heard recently is a woman who got screwed over by her no - show husband and was about to get trafficked , murdered , or both . ”
14335	14338	14339	14339	I	3485	“ Exactly ! ”
14346	14364	14339	14339	I	3485	“ Yes ! See ? If something happens to me , it will be on your conscience . ”
14388	14436	14380	14380	He	142	“ First of all , as I mentioned not two seconds ago , I have no conscience . Second , whatever happens to you is on you and the complete and utter buffoon you married . I ’m not another item on your pile of bad decisions . ”
14437	14451	14380	14380	He	142	“ Marrying Paxton was n’t a bad decision . I married for love . ”
14486	14494	14495	14495	He	142	“ All middle - class girls do . ”
14503	14507	14495	14495	He	142	“ Very uninspiring . ”
14508	14511	14512	14512	I	3485	“ Cillian , ”
14516	14523	14512	14512	I	3485	“ You ’re my only hope . ”
14576	14679	14567	14567	He	142	“ Here ’s the thing , Persephone . As a matter of principle , I do not give anything away without getting something back . The only thing separating myself and that loan shark who ’s after you is a privileged upbringing and opportunity . I , too , am not in the business of handing out free favors . So unless you tell me what , exactly , I could gain for the one hundred thousand dollars you ’re asking me to kiss goodbye , I ’m going to turn you down . You have ten seconds , by the way . ”
14752	14756	14757	14757	He	142	“ Five seconds . ”
14776	14785	14771	14771	He	142	“ Give me your best offer , Penrose . ”
14845	14862	14832	14832	His	142	“ Have a nice life , Flower Girl . Whatever ’s left of it , anyway . ”
14933	14954	14955	14955	She	157	“ It ’s not every day security takes out the trash . Guess there ’s a first time for everything . ”
14990	14995	14955	14955	She	157	“ We ’re pregnant . ”
15078	15094	15045	15045	she	593	“ Eight weeks in . Still early , but we wanted to let you know . ”
15372	15387	15388	15388	I	3485	“ Great job there , sweetheart . Best news we ’ve had all year . ”
15458	15467	15468	15468	Mother	130	“ Are n’t you going to say anything ? ”
15485	15490	15478	15478	I	3485	“ To more Fitzpatricks . ”
15491	15500	15501	15501	Athair	174	“ And to the men who make them . ”
15742	15747	15748	15748	I	3485	“ Well , Athair , ”
15752	15767	15748	15748	I	3485	“ I ’m happy Hunter exceeded your expectations in the heir - producing department . ”
15796	15810	15811	15811	Sailor	772	“ You know , Kill , sarcasm is the lowest form of wit . ”
15827	15851	15852	15852	I	3485	“ If you were a selective conversationalist , you would n’t marry a man who thinks fart jokes are the height of comedy , ”
15856	15864	15865	15865	Hunter	489	“ Farts are the height of comedy . ”
15884	15889	15865	15865	Hunter	489	“ It ’s science . ”
15916	15923	15924	15924	Sailor	772	“ Congratulations would have been sufficient . ”
15932	15936	15937	15937	I	3485	“ Bite me . ”
15949	15952	15953	15953	Mother	130	“ Dear ! ”
15956	15970	15971	15971	Sailor	772	“ You know there ’s a term for people like you , Kill , ”
15974	15977	15978	15978	Hunter	489	“ Cunts ? ”
16032	16035	16036	16036	Mother	130	“ Language ! ”
16045	16059	16060	16060	Hunter	489	“ Yup . I speak at least two fluently — English and profanity . ”
16068	16070	16063	16063	He	489	“ fuck ”
16089	16095	16063	16063	He	489	“ be seein ’ ya , ”
16096	16099	16063	16063	He	489	“ me thinks ”
16245	16250	16251	16251	Sailor	772	“ Close , honey . ”
16257	16268	16251	16251	Sailor	772	“ Sociopaths . We call people like your brother sociopaths . ”
16269	16276	16277	16277	Hunter	489	“ That makes so much sense . ”
16282	16292	16277	16277	Hunter	489	“ He really breathes new death into the room . ”
16293	16298	16299	16300	Jane Fitzpatrick	181	“ Now , now . ”
16312	16331	16303	16304	Mother Dearest	772	“ We ’re all very excited about the new addition to the family . My very first grandchild . ”
16343	16349	16332	16332	She	181	“ Hopefully one of many . ”
16364	16386	16387	16387	Hunter	489	“ Do n’t worry , Ma , I intend to impregnate my wife as many times as she ’ll let me . ”
16432	16451	16452	16452	Ash	120	“ Gosh , I ’m so jealous , Sail ! I ca n’t wait to be a mother . ”
16466	16474	16475	16475	Sailor	772	“ You ’ll make a wonderful mom . ”
16485	16498	16499	16499	Hunter	489	“ To your imaginary kids with your brother - in - law . ”
16576	16584	16585	16585	Athair	174	“ What about you , mo òrga ? ”
16720	16725	16726	16726	I	3485	“ What about me ? ”
16757	16765	16726	16726	I	3485	“ When will you give me grandchildren ? ”
16766	16777	16818	16819	my father	743	“ I suggest you direct this question at my wife . ”
16778	16786	16726	16726	I	3485	“ You do n’t have a wife . ”
16787	16810	16818	16819	my father	743	“ Guess I wo n’t be having children anytime soon , either . Unless you ’re impartial to ill - conceived bastards . ”
16811	16817	16726	16726	I	3485	“ Over my dead body , ”
16830	16839	16840	16840	Athair	174	“ When are you announcing the pregnancy publicly ? ”
16855	16865	16866	16866	Sailor	772	“ Not before the end of the second trimester , ”
16877	16898	16866	16866	Sailor	772	“ My OB - GYN warned me the first trimester is the rockiest . Plus , it ’s bad luck . ”
16899	16908	16909	16909	Father	187	“ But a good headline for Royal Pipelines . ”
16916	16942	16909	16909	Father	187	“ Especially after the Green Living demonstration and the idiot who managed to break both her legs . The press was all over that story . ”
17005	17053	17054	17054	Ceann	188	“ Ceann beag has been the media ’s darling for the past couple of years . Nice , hard - working , approachable . A reformed playboy . Maybe he should be the face of the company for the next few months until the headlines blow over . ”
17127	17155	17156	17156	I	3485	“ You want to put my twenty - seven - year - old brother as the head of Royal Pipelines because he managed to impregnate his wife ? ”
17233	17256	17257	17257	Athair	174	“ Look , Cillian , we ’ve been facing a lot of backlash because of the refinery explosion and exploratory Arctic drills , ”
17266	17292	17293	17293	I	3485	“ The refinery explosion happened under your watch , and my Arctic exploration rigs will likely up our revenue by five billion dollars by 2030 , ”
17305	17333	17293	17293	I	3485	“ In the eight months I ’ve been doing this job , our stock has gone up fourteen percent . Not too shabby for a rookie CEO . ”
17334	17342	17343	17343	He	489	“ Not all tyrants make bad kings . ”
17348	17360	17343	17343	He	489	“ Your achievements mean nothing if the people want you dethroned . ”
17361	17368	17369	17369	I	3485	“ No one wants me dethroned . ”
17376	17383	17369	17369	I	3485	“ The board has my back . ”
17384	17395	17396	17396	he	489	“ Everyone else in the company wants to stab it , ”
17407	17439	17396	17396	he	489	“ The board only cares about the profits , and they ’d vote however I wanted them to vote if it came down to it . Do n’t get too comfortable . ”
17470	17567	17396	17396	he	489	“ You scare your employees , the media loathes you , and to the rest of the public , you ’re a mystery . No family of your own . No partner . No kids . No anchor . Do n’t think I have n’t spoken to Devon . I happen to be of the same mindset as your lawyer . You need someone to dilute your darkness , and you need her fast . Sort this out , Cillian , and do it fast . The press calls you The Villain . Make them stop . ”
17580	17589	17396	17396	he	489	“ Are you done being hysterical , Athair ? ”
17608	17716	17717	17717	He	790	“ I called you mo òrga because I never had to worry about you . You always delivered whatever I needed before I ’d even asked for it . The first perfect eldest Fitzpatrick child in generations since your great - great - great - grandfather made his way from Kilkenny to Boston on a rickety boat . But that has changed . You ’re pushing forty , and it ’s time you settle down . Especially if you want to continue being the face of this company . In case your job is not a strong enough incentive , let me spell it out for you . ”
17727	17784	17717	17717	He	790	“ The next in line for the throne is Hunter , and right now , the person after him is your future niece or nephew . Everything you ’ve worked for will be handed down to them . Everything . And if you fuck this up , I will make sure to dethrone you , too . ”
17843	17849	17833	17833	I	3485	“ More food for us . ”
18467	18470	18445	18445	She	817	“ Ouch . ”
18479	18497	18445	18445	She	817	“ Cut it out . Swear t - to God , Tree , I - I will — ”
18498	18510	18511	18511	Tree	193	“ You will what ? Tell Mommy on me . Snitch . ”
18586	18592	18593	18594	the mother	830	“ Quit fussing , Tinder , ”
18656	18665	18666	18667	little Tinder	196	“ H - e he always does this ! ”
18687	18696	18666	18667	little Tinder	196	“ Tree is a s - stinky face . ”
18697	18706	18707	18707	Tree	193	“ Well , you ’re ugly and weird , ”
18710	18720	18666	18667	little Tinder	196	“ I ’m not weird . I ’m special . ”
18899	18907	18917	18918	Andrew Arrowsmith	157	“ Arrowsmith . What a terrible surprise . ”
19034	19043	19044	19044	He	157	“ Cillian . Thought it might be you . ”
19101	19108	19109	19109	He	157	“ Tough crowd . My family . ”
19153	19170	19140	19145	two snotty kids on her lap	844	“ This is Joelle , my wife , and my twin boys , Tree and Tinder . ”
19226	19232	19233	19233	I	3485	“ Who picked their names ? ”
19260	19268	19242	19242	Joelle	3223	“ Moi . Are n’t they darling ? ”
19314	19320	19321	19321	I	3485	“ Heading back to Southie ? ”
19363	19373	19374	19374	He	157	“ You ’d be surprised to hear I am . ”
19384	19406	19374	19374	He	157	“ Bought a house there last month . I ’m getting back to my roots . To where I came from . ”
19433	19452	19374	19374	He	157	“ Just took a job with Green Living . You ’re looking at their newest chief executive officer . ”
19566	19571	19572	19572	I	3485	“ That ’s cute , ”
19576	19589	19572	19572	I	3485	“ Do they know you ’re about as competent as a napkin ? ”
19759	19769	19770	19770	He	157	“ Oh , they know my capabilities , Fitzpatrick . ”
19782	19820	19770	19770	He	157	“ Let ’s not pretend we have n’t been keeping tabs on each other . You know my credentials . My victories . My agenda . I let my principles guide me just like my old man . ”
19899	19907	19908	19908	I	3485	“ How ’s your old man doing ? ”
19911	19919	19886	19887	the accountant	205	“ He passed away three years ago . ”
19920	19926	19886	19887	the accountant	205	“ Not terribly good then . ”
19927	19939	19940	19940	He	205	“ I see being an asshole still runs in your blood . ”
19945	19952	19953	19953	I	3485	“ Ca n’t fight my DNA , ”
19957	19979	19953	19953	I	3485	“ Now , people who are out for my blood are another thing . I can fight them tooth and nail . ”
19980	19990	19991	19991	Andrew	205	“ How ’bout Gerald ? Still hanging in there ? ”
19998	20013	19953	19953	I	3485	“ You know Gerry . He can survive anything short of a nuclear blast . ”
20014	20048	20049	20049	He	205	“ Speaking of soon - to - be dead things , I hear Daddy gave you the keys to Royal Pipelines since he had to step down because of … what was it ? ”
20056	20076	20049	20049	He	205	“ Type 2 diabetes ? Gluttony always ran in your family . How is he handling his health issues ? ”
20077	20087	20088	20088	I	3485	“ Wiping his tears with hundred - dollar bills . ”
20214	20227	20228	20228	I	3485	“ Are you going to skip to the good part , Andrew ? ”
20235	20248	20228	20228	I	3485	“ No part of me believes we bumped into each other accidentally . ”
20249	20256	20257	20257	Andrew	157	“ Always such a straight shooter . ”
20273	20309	20257	20257	Andrew	157	“ I may or may not have taken the job to settle an old score . The minute I heard you were on the throne , the temptation to behead the king became too much . ”
20319	20371	20257	20257	Andrew	157	“ Killing you and your father financially would be easy . With Gerald weak and out of the loop , and you vulnerable after years of bad press , I am going for your throat , Fitzpatrick . The media darling versus the press villain . Let the best man win . ”
20395	20403	20404	20404	I	3485	“ You always were a silly boy , ”
20418	20458	20413	20413	I	3485	“ I will strip you of all the things you ’ve managed to achieve since I ’ve last seen you . Take whatever is near and dear to you , and watch you pay . Oh , and Andrew ? ”
20468	20485	20459	20459	I	3485	“ Let me assure you , I am still the same resilient bastard you left behind . ”
20902	20907	20908	20908	I	3485	“ Let me go ! ”
20942	20945	20959	20959	he	884	“ Cillian ? ”
20994	20999	21000	21000	I	3485	“ You ’re here , ”
21025	21048	21049	21049	He	884	“ I sincerely hope our children wo n’t inherit your tendency to point out the obvious . I find it extremely trivial . ”
21080	21085	21086	21086	I	3485	“ Hmm , what ? ”
21142	21155	21156	21156	He	884	“ Remember I told you I do n’t hand out free favors ? ”
21172	21179	21156	21156	He	884	“ Kind of hard to forget . ”
21180	21189	21156	21156	He	884	“ Well , it ’s your lucky day . ”
21190	21197	21156	21156	He	884	“ Allow me to be skeptical . ”
21223	21233	21156	21156	He	884	“ I figured out what I want from you . ”
21234	21243	21244	21244	I	3485	“ You want something from little ole me ? ”
21279	21284	21270	21270	He	884	“ I ’m speechless . ”
21285	21296	21297	21297	he	884	“ Do n’t get my hopes up , Flower Girl , ”
21367	21382	21383	21383	he	892	“ For this to work , you must n’t develop any feelings for me , ”
21459	21485	21513	21513	his	892	“ I will take care of your money and divorce problems . Make them go away . Not as a loan , but a gift . ”
21492	21503	21513	21513	his	892	“ Oh , God . Cillian , thank you so — ”
21504	21509	21510	21510	he	892	“ Let me finish , ”
21523	21616	21510	21510	he	892	“ I never let a good crisis go to waste , and yours might be very beneficial for me . You wo n’t have to pay me because your form of compensation will be on the unconventional side . You are going to be my wife . You will marry me , Persephone Penrose . Smile for the cameras for me . Attend charity events on my behalf . And give me children . As many as needed until I have a son . Be it one , three , or six . ”
21617	21620	21621	21621	I	3485	“ Anything ! ”
21636	21642	21621	21621	I	3485	“ I would love to — ”
21745	21753	21754	21754	I	3485	“ You want me to marry you ? ”
21807	21810	21811	21811	I	3485	“ No . ”
21816	21831	21832	21832	I	3485	“ Not in a million years . No , nope , nien , niet . ”
21846	21849	21850	21850	I	3485	“ No , ”
21854	21865	21850	21850	I	3485	“ The last one was in Spanish , not English . ”
21866	21869	21870	21870	he	892	“ Elaborate , ”
21873	21886	21887	21887	I	3485	“ We ca n’t marry . We do n’t love each other . ”
21894	21907	21887	21887	I	3485	“ And yes , I know love is so very working class . ”
21908	21912	21913	21913	he	892	“ Middle class , ”
21916	21960	21961	21961	he	892	“ The happy , dumb medium is comfortable enough not to care , and stupid enough not to aim higher . Working and upper classes always take financial matters into consideration . May I remind you the last time you married for love , ”
21971	22019	21961	21961	he	892	“ it ended with a massive debt , a runaway husband , and death threats ? Love is overrated , not to mention fickle . It comes and goes . You ca n’t build a foundation on it . Mutual interests and alliance are a different story . ”
22147	22155	22156	22156	I	3485	“ Look , how about a compromise ? ”
22160	22187	22156	22156	I	3485	“ I can date you . Be your girlfriend . Hang on your arm and take a good picture . We ’ll have a little arrangement . ”
22196	22208	22188	22188	He	892	“ You think your company is worth a hundred thousand dollars ? ”
22209	22249	22250	22250	I	3485	“ You ’re offering me a hundred grand to become your live - in escort and bear your children . Plural . If I were a surrogate , I ’d get that same amount of money for one baby , ”
22254	22260	22261	22261	He	892	“ Go be a surrogate . ”
22264	22278	22188	22188	He	892	“ It ’s a long procedure . I do n’t have enough time . ”
22279	22291	22292	22292	He	892	“ You do n’t seem to have enough brain , either . ”
22310	22322	22292	22292	He	892	“ Take my offer . It ’s your only way out . ”
22328	22334	22292	22292	He	892	“ You ’re a bastard . ”
22339	22356	22335	22335	He	892	“ You knew that when you offered yourself to me very willingly all those years ago . ”
22383	22386	22387	22387	I	3485	“ Look . ”
22397	22406	22387	22387	I	3485	“ How about we start dating and I — ”
22407	22410	22411	22411	he	892	“ No , ”
22417	22422	22411	22411	he	892	“ Marriage or nothing . ”
22423	22431	22387	22387	I	3485	“ You do n’t even like me ! ”
22444	22456	22411	22411	he	892	“ What does liking you have to do with marrying you ? ”
22457	22477	22411	22411	he	892	“ Everything ! It has everything to do with it ! How do you expect us to get along ? ”
22478	22483	22484	22484	he	892	“ I do n’t , ”
22488	22593	22594	22594	he	900	“ You ’ll have your house . I ’ll have mine . You will be stunningly rich , live on Billionaires ’ Row , and become one of New England ’s most envied socialites . You ’ll be far enough away from me to do whatever the hell you ’d like . I am sensible , fair , and realistic . As long as you give me heirs , give me exclusivity throughout our child - producing years , and stay out of tabloids , you should n’t see much of me beyond the first few years of our marriage . But no divorce , ”
22601	22622	22594	22594	he	900	“ It ’s tacky , bad for business , and shows you ’re a quitter . I ’m no quitter . ”
22662	22677	22678	22678	I	3485	“ You realize I ’m a person and not an air fryer , right ? ”
22690	22706	22678	22678	I	3485	“ Because to me it sounds a lot like you ’re trying to buy me . ”
22707	22714	22715	22715	He	900	“ That ’s because I am . ”
22734	22768	22726	22726	I	3485	“ People who vilify money have one thing in common — they do n’t have it . You have a chance to change your fate , Persephone . Do n’t mess it up . ”
22769	22811	22728	22732	the one with the problem	902	“ Sorry if I sound ungrateful , but your proposition sounds like a very sad existence to me . I want to be loved . To be cherished . To grow old with the man I choose and who chooses me . ”
22881	22955	22855	22855	He	902	“ You can have all those things in time , just not with me . Find yourself a lover . Lead a quiet life with him — provided he signs all the necessary paperwork . You ’ll do you ; I ’ll do me . What I do , in case you have any lingering romantic ideas about us , includes an insatiable amount of high - end escorts and questionable sexual practices . ”
22995	23004	23005	23005	I	3485	“ You want me to cheat on you ? ”
23011	23026	23071	23071	Backup	214	“ After you give me legitimate children , you can do whatever you want . ”
23027	23033	23034	23034	I	3485	“ You need a hug . ”
23037	23047	23034	23034	I	3485	“ And a shrink . Not in that order . ”
23048	23070	23071	23071	Backup	214	“ What I need is siring heirs . At least one male . A couple of others for appearance and backup . ”
23122	23154	23155	23155	I	3485	“ Why male ? In case you have n’t noticed , this is the twenty - first century . There are women like Irene Rosenfeld , Mary Barra , Corie Barry … ”
23166	23211	23155	23155	I	3485	“ Spare me the supermarket list . The truth of the matter is , some things have n’t changed . Women born into obscene privilege — aka my future daughters — rarely opt for hectic careers , which is what running Royal Pipelines demands . ”
23212	23224	23155	23155	I	3485	“ That is the most sexist thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
23225	23236	23237	23237	He	142	“ Shockingly , I agree with you on that point . ”
23248	23296	23237	23237	He	142	“ Nonetheless , I ’m not the one making the rules . Traditionally , the firstborn ’s son inherits most of the shares and the role of CEO in Royal Pipelines . That ’s how my father got the gig . That ’s how I got it . ”
23297	23308	23309	23309	He	142	“ What if the kid wants to be something else ? ”
23339	23358	23237	23237	He	142	“ Who does n’t want to be the head of one of the richest companies in the world ? ”
23359	23370	23371	23371	I	3485	“ Anyone who knows what a role like that entails , ”
23375	23391	23371	23371	I	3485	“ No offense , but you ’re not the happiest man I know , Kill . ”
23392	23401	23402	23402	he	142	“ My first son will continue my legacy , ”
23410	23430	23402	23402	he	142	“ If you ’re worried about his mental health , I suggest you send him to therapy from infancy . ”
23431	23443	23444	23444	I	3485	“ Sounds like you ’re going to be a wonderful father . ”
23452	23473	23402	23402	he	142	“ They ’ll have a soft mother . Least I can do is give them the hard facts of life . ”
23474	23479	23444	23444	I	3485	“ You ’re awful . ”
23480	23485	23486	23486	he	142	“ You ’re stalling , ”
23715	23724	23707	23707	I	3485	“ Look , can I think about it ? ”
23725	23745	23746	23749	his rich - boy	914	“ Of course . You have plenty of time . It ’s not like the mob is after you , ”
23799	23805	23779	23783	the man who crushed me	915	“ Give me a week . ”
23806	23812	23813	23813	he	172	“ Twenty - four hours , ”
23817	23832	23779	23783	the man who crushed me	915	“ Four days . You ’re talking about the rest of my life here . ”
23833	23873	23779	23783	the man who crushed me	915	“ You ’re not going to have a life if you do n’t accept . Forty - eight hours . That ’s my final offer , and it ’s a generous one . You know where to find me . ”
23885	23888	23889	23889	I	3485	“ Wait , ”
23978	24006	23967	23969	a man I	917	“ Give me your home address . I do n’t want to go to your office again . It makes me feel like we ’re conducting business . ”
24007	24013	24071	24071	He	172	“ We are conducting business . ”
24014	24030	23967	23969	a man I	917	“ Your PA is horrible . She almost stabbed me that day I visited you . ”
24031	24039	24071	24071	He	172	“ Almost is the operative word here . ”
24055	24070	24045	24045	he	172	“ I would n’t have covered her legal fees , and she knows it . ”
24078	24084	24085	24085	he	172	“ Forty - eight hours , ”
24089	24121	24085	24085	he	172	“ If I do n’t hear from you , I ’ll assume you declined my offer or were offed prematurely , and move on to the next candidate on my list . ”
24122	24128	24129	24129	My	3485	“ There ’s a list . ”
24206	24219	24220	24220	I	3485	“ Go browse through your mail - order brides catalog , Cillian . ”
24227	24236	24220	24220	I	3485	“ I ’ll let you know my answer . ”
24877	24882	24884	24885	Whitney Houston	218	“ How Will I Know ”
24959	24971	24931	24932	Flower Girl	3223	“ To marry or not to marry Boston ’s favorite villain ? ”
25076	25101	25115	25115	his	944	“ Good session , Mr. Fitzpatrick . You ’re one of the most talented equestrians I ’ve ever seen . Mad skills , sir . ”
25211	25229	25194	25194	I	3485	“ Thanks for the tip , Mr. Fitzpatrick ! You ’re the best boss I ’ve ever — ”
25230	25255	25256	25256	I	3485	“ If I wanted my ass kissed , I ’d go for someone curvier , blonder , and with an entirely different reproductive system , ”
25260	25267	25268	25268	He	944	“ Right . Yes . Sorry . ”
26007	26027	26028	26028	I	3485	“ Let ’s hope for your sake you ’re not dumb enough to turn down my offer , too , ”
26144	26146	26148	26149	Gogol Bordello	222	“ Sally ”
26184	26198	26199	26199	Hunter	489	“ Do n’t worry , sons . It ’ll all be over soon , ”
26211	26221	26199	26199	Hunter	489	“ Poker is not for the faint of heart . ”
26222	26238	26239	26239	Sam	2667	“ This , from someone who is a Nordstrom membership away from being a chick . ”
26264	26275	26276	26276	Hunter	489	“ You bet your ass I have a Nordstrom membership . ”
26281	26303	26276	26276	Hunter	489	“ I do n’t have time to shop with my stylist , and the ladies at the store know my measurements . ”
26304	26317	26318	26318	Devon	177	“ I see your thirty - five k and raise eight thousand . ”
26437	26441	26442	26442	I	3485	“ All in , ”
26458	26465	26466	26466	Devon	177	“ You ’re taking the piss . ”
26485	26511	26474	26474	Hunter	489	“ It ’s a zero - sum game , Monsieur Whitehall . Do n’t step into the kitchen if you do n’t like the burn . ”
26512	26519	26520	26520	I	3485	“ You ’re mixing two phrases , ”
26540	26577	26520	26520	I	3485	“ It ’s do n’t step into the kitchen if you ca n’t take the heat . Burn is what you get between your legs for sleeping with enough women to fill up Madison Square Garden . ”
26578	26596	26597	26597	Hunter	489	“ Funny , I do n’t remember you inviting me to your sainthood ceremony , big bro . ”
26613	26655	26597	26597	Hunter	489	“ Oh , that ’s right , it never happened because you bonked half of Europe . ’ Sides , this was all in the past . I ’m a married man now . There ’s only one woman for me . ”
26656	26688	26689	26689	Sam	2667	“ And that woman is my sister , so you better think carefully about what you say next if you want to get out of here with all your organs intact , ”
26727	26774	26775	26775	Hunter	489	“ Dude , my wife is knocked up . Too late for you to second - guess what we ’re doing in our spare time . By the way , the abdomen pain she had this week turned out to be gas , thanks for asking , ”
26790	26806	26807	26807	I	3485	“ Not every single conversation must circle back to the fact your wife is pregnant , ”
26811	26815	26816	26816	Sam	2667	“ Prove it . ”
26823	26837	26838	26838	he	2667	“ You realize I will kill your brother at some point , right ? ”
26842	26850	26851	26851	I	3485	“ Wo n’t hold it against you . ”
26860	26870	26851	26851	I	3485	“ But wait until after he reveals his cards . ”
26871	26877	26878	26878	Devon	177	“ Speaking of marital bliss , ”
26889	26901	26878	26878	Devon	177	“ I believe our host has some marvelous news to share . ”
26902	26913	26914	26914	Hunter	489	“ Aww , you finally opened an account on OkCupid ? ”
26922	26947	26914	26914	Hunter	489	“ Our parents have been riding his ass for being lonelier than a satanist in a Youth for Jesus convention for a while now . ”
26948	26964	26965	26965	Sam	2667	“ It ’ll be a cold day in hell when Cillian Fitzpatrick says I do , ”
26968	26977	26978	26978	Devon	177	“ Better bring a warm coat , mate . ”
26981	27002	27003	27003	Sam	2667	“ Hell ’s not ready for me yet . And Cillian likes variety too much to settle for one pussy . ”
27011	27023	27024	27024	I	3485	“ Women are like pancakes . They all taste the same , ”
27032	27038	27027	27027	Sam	2667	“ I fucking love pancakes . ”
27203	27208	27209	27209	I	3485	“ I ’m engaged . ”
27302	27305	27306	27306	he	489	“ Engaged ! ”
27317	27328	27306	27306	he	489	“ Who ’s the unlucky woman ? Your blowup doll ? ”
27329	27336	27306	27306	he	489	“ Her name is Minka Gomes . ”
27337	27345	27346	27347	My brother	760	“ You named your blowup doll Minka ? ”
27364	27381	27346	27347	My brother	760	“ I thought you ’d go for something more stripper - y. Like Lola or Candy . ”
27382	27394	27395	27395	Sam	2667	“ I do n’t recall running a background check on her . ”
27422	27440	27441	27441	I	3485	“ Just because you have n’t heard of her does n’t mean she ’s not in existence , ”
27568	27591	27592	27592	Hunter	489	“ Please explain to me how you went from corrupting Europe ’s finest princesses to getting engaged to some random local chick . ”
28230	28300	28222	28222	Athair	174	“ This , mo òrga , is the only thing women are good for . Opening their legs and taking orders . You ’d be wise to remember that . Try to upgrade your mistresses often , never get attached to any of them , and when the time to settle down comes , make sure you find someone manageable . Someone who would n’t ask for too much . ”
28449	28454	28455	28455	Hunter	489	“ Earth to Kill ? ”
28465	28474	28455	28455	Hunter	489	“ I asked why Minka . Why now ? ”
28506	28514	28490	28492	my estate manager	142	“ You have a visitor , sir . ”
28567	28572	28573	28573	I	3485	“ Who is it ? ”
28576	28580	28573	28573	I	3485	“ Mrs. Veitch . ”
28599	28604	28605	28605	I	3485	“ I ’m busy . ”
28611	28621	28605	28605	I	3485	“ Sir , it ’s late and raining hard . ”
28622	28648	28605	28605	I	3485	“ I can read the time and look through the window . Call her a cab if you feel so inclined to be a gentleman . ”
28649	28665	28666	28666	Petar	142	“ There ’s a storm . Lines are down . Taxi apps are n’t working , ”
28703	28715	28690	28690	I	3485	“ She is soaked to the bone and seems pretty upset . ”
28730	28740	28716	28716	Hunter	489	“ She has five minutes . Bring her in . ”
28741	28752	28753	28753	Petar	142	“ You want her to come here to this room ? ”
28842	28873	28832	28832	I	3485	“ It ’s my way or the highway , and as far as my knowledge goes , Mrs. Veitch ca n’t afford a car . Send . Her . In . ”
29033	29037	29006	29006	She	516	“ I accept . ”
29053	29059	29060	29060	I	3485	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
29196	29200	29201	29201	Her	516	“ Your offer . ”
29210	29215	29201	29201	Her	516	“ I accept it . ”
29299	29304	29305	29305	Hunter	489	“ Persy , I — ”
29349	29360	29361	29361	I	3485	“ You know why I like Greek mythology , Persephone ? ”
29384	29429	29364	29364	Her	516	“ The gods have a history of punishing women for hubris . You see , fifty - five hours ago , I was n’t good enough to be your husband . It took you longer than we ’d agreed to get back to me . ”
29452	29458	29459	29459	Her	516	“ There was a storm . ”
29463	29478	29459	29459	Her	516	“ Trains were down . I had to ride my bike in the rain — ”
29479	29484	29492	29492	I	3485	“ I ’m bored . ”
29510	29524	29492	29492	I	3485	“ And you ’re late . That is the essence of the situation . ”
29525	29535	29573	29573	Wrath	234	“ I came here as soon as I could ! ”
29620	29627	29628	29628	I	3485	“ Already proposed to someone else . ”
29654	29659	29628	29628	I	3485	“ She accepted immediately . ”
29886	29893	29894	29894	she	220	“ You proposed to someone else , ”
29900	29904	29905	29905	Sam	2667	“ Minka Gomes . ”
29939	29957	29931	29931	He	2667	“ We ’re trying to figure out where he found the poor thing . Ring a bell ? ”
29958	29964	29965	29965	she	220	“ I ’m afraid not , ”
29969	30033	30034	30034	Sam	2667	“ Dodged a bullet . Kill ’s too cold , too old , and too set in his ways for a nice girl like you . Not to mention , I have my suspicions about his preferences in the sack . Light a candle for Miss Gomes next time you go to church and thank your lucky stars . They definitely aligned tonight . ”
30055	30058	30059	30059	Hunter	489	“ Persy . ”
30062	30065	30059	30059	Hunter	489	“ Wait . ”
30076	30110	30059	30059	Hunter	489	“ I ’m okay , Hunt . Totally fine . Please , get back to your game . Thank you for your time . I hope you enjoy the rest of the evening . ”
30162	30168	30177	30178	my brother	760	“ Finish the game first . ”
30169	30176	30181	30181	His	760	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? ”
30198	30237	30238	30238	He	760	“ You went around Boston proposing to women — one of them my wife ’s best friend — and you want me to finish the fucking game ? Fine . Here . Whatever Kill wants , Kill gets . ”
30246	30264	30265	30265	He	760	“ Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I ’m going to go fix this shit . ”
30271	30314	30265	30265	He	760	“ The last thing my pregnant missus needs is a pissed - off friend . Swear to God , Kill , if you pulled something on this girl … if you somehow got her pregnant to make sure you have an heir … ”
30721	30727	30714	30714	his	1089	“ Think again , bitch . ”
30819	30825	30847	30847	Kaminski	134	“ Fuck ! You whore ! ”
30849	30852	30853	30853	I	3485	“ Tom , ”
30890	30904	30913	30913	he	1089	“ Please , Tom . Get off me . I ca n’t breathe . ”
31036	31049	31050	31050	His	134	“ Why do n’t we see what you ’re worth , huh ? ”
31057	31080	31050	31050	His	134	“ Seein ’ as you ’ll be sucking a lot of cock in a few days to pay back Pax ’s debt . ”
31192	31243	31244	31244	He	134	“ Saved by the bell . You killed my hard - on , but that just means I ’ll take you up the ass next time . You ’ve got a week , Mrs. V. One week before I turn all your nightmares into reality . You better believe it . ”
31497	31534	31535	31535	My	3485	“ Employee compensation within the oil and gas industry is currently on the rise , and we came up with a great plan to preserve key staffers and encourage potential prospects to apply to Royal Pipelines … ”
32791	32801	32802	32803	The receptionist	1146	“ There it is , Ms. Persy ’s class . ”
33034	33038	33024	33024	She	3223	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick . ”
33039	33043	33024	33024	She	3223	“ Miss Penrose . ”
33044	33047	33048	33048	she	3223	“ Veitch , ”
33056	33061	33062	33062	I	3485	“ Not for long , ”
33066	33070	33062	33062	I	3485	“ A word ? ”
33071	33085	33024	33024	She	3223	“ I know many . My favorite one right now is — leave . ”
33086	33094	33095	33095	I	3485	“ You want to hear me out . ”
33100	33109	33095	33095	I	3485	“ Now say goodbye to your little friends . ”
33143	33150	33151	33151	She	3223	“ What are you doing here ? ”
33249	33256	33257	33257	I	3485	“ When are you done here ? ”
33260	33267	33333	33334	The woman	1164	“ Not for another four hours . ”
33268	33277	33333	33334	The woman	1164	“ Take the rest of the day off . ”
33278	33291	33292	33292	Her	1164	“ Are you crazy ? I can barely afford my lunch breaks . ”
33296	33332	33292	33292	Her	1164	“ I only take them because I have to by law . I asked the director to stay after school hours to help clean up and get some extra money . I ca n’t bail . ”
33408	33427	33428	33428	I	3485	“ Take the rest of the day off , or you will have no job to return to , ”
33464	33473	33474	33474	Her	1164	“ What the hell happened to your face ? ”
33518	33530	33504	33504	She	1164	“ It ’s nothing . None of your concern , anyway . ”
33584	33613	33582	33582	her	1164	“ You have ten minutes to wrap this up and meet me outside . You should know by now that I do not like to be kept waiting . ”
33688	33692	33693	33693	I	3485	“ Drive around , ”
33749	33825	33733	33733	her	1164	“ We will live in separate houses . I ’ll remain in my estate , and you ’ll live down the road . There ’s a new construction on Commonwealth Avenue . A four - bedroom , thirty - five - hundred - square - foot condo . I asked my realtor to secure you the penthouse for a rental . You can discuss your permanent residence with her and tailor it to your preference . ”
33840	33843	33826	33826	She	1172	“ What ? ”
33844	33857	33826	33826	She	1172	“ I said , there ’s a new estate on Commonwealth Ave — ”
33858	33865	33866	33866	Her	1172	“ I heard what you said . ”
33870	33880	33866	33866	Her	1172	“ I thought you wanted to marry someone else . ”
33881	33906	33912	33912	I	3485	“ Want is a big word . I decided to settle for you since the other woman is not on the brink of extinction . ”
34019	34035	34011	34011	She	3223	“ She said no , did n’t she ? Could n’t stomach being your wife . ”
34055	34059	34060	34060	She	3223	“ Smart girl . ”
34070	34090	34044	34044	her	3223	“ Judging by the state of your face , turning me down is not a luxury you can afford . ”
34131	34138	34139	34139	She	3223	“ Can I try your cigar ? ”
34148	34170	34171	34171	I	3485	“ I ’m offering you a twenty - million - dollar condo , and you are asking me about a cigar ? ”
34178	34192	34193	34193	She	3223	“ Paxton never let me try them . He said cigars are manly . ”
34312	34319	34363	34363	She	3223	“ It tastes like burning feet . ”
34320	34328	34363	34363	She	3223	“ You ’re not supposed to inhale . ”
34338	34362	34363	34363	She	3223	“ Nor are you supposed to lick burning feet . Now suck on it like it ’s a dick , not a joint . ”
34375	34381	34363	34363	She	3223	“ Sounds like an audition . ”
34382	34387	34388	34388	I	3485	“ Do n’t flirt , ”
34391	34401	34388	34388	I	3485	“ It ’s not your affection I ’m after . ”
34557	34565	34566	34566	She	800	“ What else would our marriage entail ? ”
34576	34603	34566	34566	She	800	“ You will be available to me for social gatherings , volunteer at my charity of choice , and play your part as a dutiful wife . ”
34604	34607	34608	34608	She	800	“ Hmm . ”
34623	34627	34608	34608	She	800	“ Anything more ? ”
34628	34663	34566	34566	She	800	“ You will have to sign an airtight NDA and a draconic pre - nuptial agreement . But as long as you ’re my wife , you ’ll be provided for . Generously so . ”
34664	34676	34608	34608	She	800	“ What if you decide to divorce me for someone else ? ”
34693	34706	34707	34707	I	3485	“ I would n’t let that worry keep you up at night , ”
34711	34747	34707	34707	I	3485	“ I do n’t have feelings , Flower Girl , which means I ca n’t give them to you nor can I take them from you . I will not develop any toward anyone else . ”
34748	34754	34755	34755	she	1187	“ Other than our heirs , ”
34798	34801	34802	34802	I	3485	“ Naturally . ”
34813	34859	34802	34802	I	3485	“ As previously mentioned , sex is not a part of the bargain . I will satisfy my sexual needs elsewhere . The encounters will be discreet and confidential , but they will happen , and I expect no fits of drama from your end . ”
34896	34906	34891	34891	She	1187	“ You mean you ’ll still go to hookers ? ”
34907	34918	34891	34891	She	1187	“ They prefer to be called sex workers these days . ”
34919	34922	34891	34891	She	1187	“ Why ? ”
34923	34958	34891	34891	She	1187	“ I imagine because hooker has a degrading connotation and implies both criminal and immortal activity . Though I do not engage in deep conversation with the women I hire to suck my cock . ”
34959	34976	34891	34891	She	1187	“ No , why do you hire escorts ? You can have any woman you want . ”
34977	35012	34891	34891	She	1187	“ And I can have any woman I want because of my bank account . Which brings us to square one — why not pay for the service and skip the dinner and chitchat ? ”
35013	35022	35023	35023	she	1192	“ What ’s wrong with dinner and chitchat ? ”
35026	35039	34891	34891	She	1187	“ They require socializing , and I am firmly against the concept . ”
35040	35049	34891	34891	She	1187	“ What made you the way you are ? ”
35050	35056	35057	35057	I	3485	“ The way I am ? ”
35060	35067	35068	35068	Her	1192	“ Cold . Ruthless . Jaded . ”
35083	35098	34891	34891	She	1187	“ A mixture of crushing expectations , a bad year , and lackluster upbringing . ”
35174	35182	35168	35168	Her	1192	“ I do n’t buy your story . ”
35183	35194	35168	35168	Her	1192	“ Lucky for me , I ’m not James Patterson . ”
35195	35207	35168	35168	Her	1192	“ Will we be sharing joint custody of our poor children ? ”
35208	35212	35213	35213	I	3485	“ We could , ”
35217	35245	35213	35213	I	3485	“ if you do n’t mind them growing up with nannies half the time . I ’ll be busy running Royal Pipelines and expanding the Fitzpatrick empire . ”
35263	35270	35271	35271	She	1197	“ Let me get this straight . ”
35279	35303	35271	35271	She	1197	“ You want to have kids , but you do n’t want to take care of them or make them with your wife ? ”
35304	35317	35318	35318	I	3485	“ You seem to be figuring it out well all by yourself . ”
35324	35333	35318	35318	I	3485	“ That ’s exactly what I ’m saying . ”
35334	35361	35271	35271	She	1197	“ Well , then I suggest you drop me off right here , go back to Minka , and pick up where you both left off . ”
35390	35397	35398	35398	I	3485	“ I ca n’t raise children , ”
35402	35454	35459	35459	Disney	247	“ You will not be a deadbeat dad . You will take care of them half the time . And I mean really spend time with them . Change diapers , take them to T - ball practices , and reenact their favorite Disney movies . With full - blown costumes . ”
35498	35501	35502	35502	I	3485	“ Sure , ”
35505	35514	35502	35502	I	3485	“ I ’ll do all of that nonsense . ”
35548	35589	35532	35532	She	3223	“ I have other conditions , too . I ’ll be able to keep my job and move around unrestricted . You will not be putting any surveillance or security on me . I want to live a normal life . ”
35590	35603	35604	35605	The girl	3223	“ You wo n’t need to work a day in your life . ”
35615	35618	35619	35619	She	3223	“ So ? ”
35657	35667	35668	35668	She	3223	“ I do n’t work because I have to . ”
35673	35683	35668	35668	She	3223	“ I work because I love what I do . ”
35688	35695	35668	35668	She	3223	“ Fine . Keep your job . ”
35696	35701	35738	35738	She	3223	“ What about security ? ”
35702	35706	35668	35668	She	3223	“ No security . ”
35717	35737	35738	35738	She	3223	“ One more thing — as long as other men are off - limits , so are other women . ”
35746	35754	35755	35755	I	3485	“ This is not how it works . ”
35795	35809	35792	35793	this woman	1206	“ You ’re the one at my mercy . I make the rules . ”
35810	35814	35815	35815	She	3223	“ Am I ? ”
35821	35889	35815	35815	She	3223	“ Because , correct me if I ’m wrong , but you seemed to have told me you have another wife lined up , and a nice , long list of potential candidates if she does n’t work out . Yet here you are with me . For a reason I ca n’t fathom , we want each other . Let ’s not pretend otherwise , Kill . ”
35904	35941	35989	35989	She	1208	“ The only reason I prefer you to Minka is because if you die , the women in my life would be upset , and the one thing I dislike more than humans are distressed humans . ”
35942	35956	35957	35957	she	1208	“ I do n’t care what excuse you give yourself for marrying me , ”
35961	35981	35957	35957	she	1208	“ If we get married , we ’ll be equal . At least , you ’ll pretend we are . ”
36007	36014	36015	36015	I	3485	“ Let me put this plainly . ”
36019	36033	36015	36015	I	3485	“ I ’m not going to stay celibate for months or even weeks . ”
36034	36047	36048	36048	She	1208	“ You wo n’t have to . You ’ll have a wife . ”
36090	36093	36094	36094	I	3485	“ No . ”
36103	36108	36094	36094	I	3485	“ No , what ? ”
36109	36117	36094	36094	I	3485	“ I wo n’t sleep with you . ”
36118	36122	36094	36094	I	3485	“ Why not ? ”
36123	36131	36094	36094	I	3485	“ Because I do n’t want to . ”
36132	36137	36094	36094	I	3485	“ Why ’s that ? ”
36138	36146	36147	36147	I	3485	“ Because you do n’t attract me , ”
36219	36243	36244	36244	She	3162	“ How , pray tell , do you mean to impregnate me , if you do n’t want to have sex with me ? ”
36254	36276	36244	36244	She	3162	“ You are familiar with how babies come to be , right ? Because none of the versions include a cabbage . ”
36287	36305	36306	36306	I	3485	“ I know how babies are made , Persephone . That ’s why I bought a stork , ”
36345	36359	36310	36310	She	3162	“ I did n’t know you had a sense of humor , Kill . ”
36360	36375	36376	36376	I	3485	“ I did n’t know you were so hard - pressed to get laid , ”
36393	36424	36387	36391	aka Lord of the Sleep	239	“ To answer your question , we ’ll use IVF . You ’ll be knocked up in no time , and we wo n’t have to know each other biblically . ”
36425	36433	36434	36434	She	3162	“ What ’s wrong with the Bible ? ”
36438	36442	36443	36443	I	3485	“ False advertisement . ”
36447	36453	36443	36443	I	3485	“ God does n’t exist . ”
36480	36488	36473	36473	she	3162	“ I really ought to hate you . ”
36489	36507	36473	36473	she	3162	“ Do n’t bother . Hate is just love with fear and jealousy thrown into the mix . ”
36508	36517	36518	36518	She	3162	“ Why me ? Why not my sister ? ”
36593	36623	36580	36580	she	3162	“ Because she possesses virtually all of the traits I despise in a person — from being eccentric , entitled , bigmouthed , and opinionated to simply being alive . ”
36624	36631	36635	36635	her	3162	“ Yet you always ogle her . ”
36655	36670	36671	36671	I	3485	“ I looked at her because I did n’t want to look at you , ”
36674	36685	36671	36671	I	3485	“ Why did n’t you want to look at me ? ”
36735	36795	36717	36718	this woman	1206	“ Does it matter why I could n’t look at you ? I ’m looking at you now , and I ’ve come to terms with what I see . Speaking of your sister , she would have taken no longer than five minutes of negotiations and a quickie to convince . Yet you ’re the one I chose . ”
36848	36860	36861	36861	I	3485	“ We ’re done here . Email me your ring measurements . ”
36877	36885	36871	36871	She	3223	“ Two more conditions before I accept . ”
36953	36956	36913	36913	she	3223	“ Shoot . ”
36957	37049	37080	37080	her	1218	“ One — I want us to conceive our children the old - fashioned way . I know you think it ’s pitiful and pathetic of me , but I do n’t care . I do n’t want to go through IVF treatments . I do n’t want to take someone else ’s place in my quest for a baby before I tried the natural way . I know I ’m not your taste , but if I come this far for you , it is only fair that you will … ”
37050	37055	37056	37056	I	3485	“ Come inside you , ”
37061	37065	37056	37056	I	3485	“ Got it . ”
37119	37123	37124	37124	I	3485	“ Your funeral , ”
37127	37148	37124	37124	I	3485	“ I ’m a notoriously selfish man , in bed and out of it . What ’s the other condition ? ”
37149	37173	37213	37213	Her	1218	“ No escorts until I conceive . You ca n’t hop in and out of my bed and still visit your European girlfriends . ”
37174	37177	37124	37124	I	3485	“ No . ”
37178	37181	37182	37182	she	1218	“ Yes , ”
37190	37212	37182	37182	she	1218	“ When you need satisfaction , you will come to me . We ’ll service each other until I fall pregnant . ”
37346	37368	37321	37321	She	1218	“ You drive a hard bargain . Welcome to the dark side , Persephone . Leave your heart at the door . ”
37434	37438	37439	37439	I	3485	“ Mr. Whitehall ? ”
37497	37507	37484	37484	She	1225	“ And who is this foam - born Aphrodite ? ”
37508	37535	37484	37484	She	1225	“ That would be my sister , Mr. Zeus . Now if you ’d be as kind as to peel your creepy eyes off her legs … ”
37590	37699	37586	37588	A mysterious one	1226	“ I filled out most of it . Sign where indicated with arrow flags and your initials on the bottom of each page . Go through your spouse ’s details one more time and ensure all the information is correct . There ’s a list of outstanding documentation I ’ll need you to hand over before the marriage can be resolved . It ’s on the last page . Get it to me by tomorrow morning . It ’ll take the court two business days to process the application , in which you agree not to claim any of your and Mr. Veitch ’s mutual funds or possessions . ”
37700	37709	37586	37588	A mysterious one	1226	“ We have no mutual funds or possessions . ”
37710	37713	37586	37588	A mysterious one	1226	“ Precisely . ”
37797	37806	37780	37780	I	3485	“ Thank you , Devon . That ’s — ”
37807	37820	37821	37821	He	177	“ Bugger , do n’t thank me , you silly little thing . ”
37832	37908	37909	37909	He	177	“ I did n’t do this out of the goodness of my heart . I did it because your future husband needs a baby - maker , preferably the kind that would bring positive press to his doorstep . Which is why you will also find in this load of legal documents a nondisclosure agreement and a prenup , both of which I advise you to read carefully in the company of a proper solicitor . ”
37924	37974	37909	37909	He	177	“ Here ’s some cash in case you ca n’t afford one . Consider this my wedding gift to you . There ’s a sheet of dos and don’ts attached , some stipulations you verbally agreed to yesterday . No house - sharing , a non - compete clause … ”
37975	37980	37981	37981	I	3485	“ Non - compete ? ”
37984	37997	37981	37981	I	3485	“ I ’m not planning to open a petroleum company anytime soon . ”
38016	38044	38013	38013	Devon	177	“ Having access to the Fitzpatrick clan means you can spy for the competitors or decide to work for someone who ’d pose a conflict of interest . ”
38045	38052	38013	38013	Devon	177	“ I ’d never do that . ”
38053	38058	38059	38059	He	177	“ Clearly , darling . ”
38082	38131	38069	38069	he	177	“ We trust you completely . And by ‘ completely ’ I mean , about eighty - three percent . The other seventeen is why we prefer to have it in writing . You ’ll have to mortgage your inner organs if your never turns into a maybe . ”
38132	38140	38141	38141	I	3485	“ How do you live with yourself ? ”
38192	38215	38216	38217	Future husband	3330	“ Considering your face was smashed by mobsters , I would n’t judge your future husband for wanting to protect his assets . ”
38229	38234	38235	38235	I	3485	“ Do you mind ? ”
38261	38270	38252	38252	I	3485	“ My sister does n’t know what happened . ”
38271	38276	38277	38277	He	177	“ Is she blind ? ”
38291	38298	38252	38252	I	3485	“ She thinks I got robbed . ”
38299	38316	38277	38277	He	177	“ No offense , but you do n’t look like the type to carry extra cash . ”
38320	38333	38277	38277	He	177	“ Or coins . Or food stamps . You ’re dreadfully gaunt . ”
38425	38438	38420	38420	I	3485	“ Look , can I have my future husband ’s phone number ? ”
38455	38463	38464	38464	I	3485	“ How do you know my code ? ”
38467	38497	38439	38439	Devon	177	“ Had to write down your birthdate six hundred times when I filled in the paperwork last night . You seem like the predictable sort . Again , no — ”
38498	38504	38505	38505	His	177	“ Offense . I know . ”
38520	38535	38505	38505	His	177	“ You realize prefacing something with these words makes it automatically offensive , right ? ”
38536	38556	38505	38505	His	177	“ The code to get to him is six six six . He only responds to texts . Sporadically . ”
38572	38577	38557	38557	Shocker	259	“ Cheers , Persephone . ”
38578	38581	38582	38582	I	3485	“ Wait ! ”
38586	38605	38582	38582	I	3485	“ What about Colin Byrne ? Can I tell him I ’ll have the money ready for him ? ”
38612	38625	38626	38626	He	177	“ Ah , that ’s the best part of becoming a Fitzpatrick . ”
38631	38683	38626	38626	He	177	“ Your problems are no longer yours . I do believe Colin is Sam Brennan ’s jurisdiction . To that end , I ’d say you ’re all covered , and that Byrne is thoroughly and royally fucked for laying a hand on you . Welcome to the family , Persy . ”
38684	38695	38720	38720	She	772	“ What do you mean you ’re breaking the pact ? ”
38859	38867	38868	38868	Ash	120	“ She is not breaking the pact . ”
38880	38896	38868	38868	Ash	120	“ She ’s still married to Paxton . She ca n’t we d anyone else . ”
38924	38931	38932	38932	I	3485	“ I am breaking the pact . ”
38950	38969	38932	38932	I	3485	“ I ’m getting married to Cillian . He is working on my divorce certificate as we speak . ”
38970	38975	38978	38978	Emmabelle	3320	“ Cillian - Cillian ? ”
38991	39020	39021	39021	My	3485	“ Tall , dark , broody . Two little red horns peeking from either side of his head ? Possibly a tail tucked between those steel ass cheeks ? ”
39036	39041	39042	39042	Ash	120	“ My brother Cillian ? ”
39045	39048	39049	39049	I	3485	“ Yes . ”
39063	39069	39049	39049	I	3485	“ One and the same . ”
39070	39073	39074	39074	Sailor	772	“ Why ? ”
39077	39080	39081	39081	Belle	485	“ How ? ”
39084	39090	39091	39091	Aisling	106	“ Is he threatening you ? ”
39094	39114	39115	39115	Sailor	772	“ Look , if it ’s about money , Hunter and I would be more than happy to help . ”
39136	39162	39163	39163	Ash	120	“ Me too . I would n’t be able to live with myself if I knew you only married my brother because you were struggling . ”
39221	39232	39233	39233	Sailor	772	“ Of course she does n’t want to marry him . ”
39241	39265	39233	39233	Sailor	772	“ It ’s Kill Fitzpatrick we ’re talking about . He has n’t exactly won any Mr. Personality awards in the last decade . ”
39266	39281	39282	39282	Aisling	106	“ Love changes people . You and my brother are prime examples of that , ”
39291	39320	39286	39286	Sailor	772	“ Hunter has always been good and lost . Cillian is bad and knows exactly where and what he is . A wolf can never be a pet . ”
39401	39404	39405	39405	I	3485	“ Look . ”
39408	39446	39405	39405	I	3485	“ Thanks for the offers , but I ’m good . I ’m marrying him because I want to . I know it ’s sudden , but Kill and I have gotten close in the past few — ”
39447	39455	39456	39456	Belle	485	“ You better not finish this sentence , ”
39466	39502	39456	39456	Belle	485	“ You ’re already breaking the pact . At least have the decency not to lie to us . You and Kill do n’t know each other beyond you being his baby sister ’s friend . ”
39503	39520	39521	39521	Sailor	772	“ If Cillian asked you to marry him , it ’s for all the wrong reasons . ”
39532	39555	39521	39521	Sailor	772	“ Did he tell you he does n’t have any feelings ? Like , at all ? He takes pride in that . ”
39572	39591	39646	39646	She	772	“ I know who Kill is . We ’ve been running in the same circles for years now . ”
39592	39599	39600	39600	Sailor	772	“ Kill does n’t run anywhere . ”
39603	39645	39600	39600	Sailor	772	“ He swaggers with a cocky grin and fucks shit up . Just tell me what kind of money you need , and I ’ll get you out of this . Forget about a loan . Do n’t pay me back . ”
39679	39694	39695	39695	Aisling	106	“ For my part , I ’ll ask Athair for a good divorce lawyer , ”
39700	39724	39695	39695	Aisling	106	“ This is totally fixable . It ’s not too late to say no . We can make sure you ’ll still get — ”
39725	39731	39732	39732	I	3485	“ You want the truth ? ”
39745	39841	39732	39732	I	3485	“ Fine , here ’s the truth — I’m not like you guys . Belle is a street - smart , man - eating lady boss who is out to conquer the world and build an empire . Aisling , you were born into royalty . You have more money than some countries , two brothers who would kill for you , and a promising career as a doctor . Sail , you already met your Prince Charming , and you have a father and brother who ’d get you out of anything . Me … ”
39850	39963	39842	39842	I	3485	“ I ’m different . I wanted to marry for love . And I did . Saying it did n’t work out would be the understatement of the century . Now it ’s time to marry for comfort . It is not the noble or honorable thing to do . Trust me , I ’m well aware of that . But it ’s my choice . I choose security . I choose stability . I know he is not going to love me , but he will take care of me , and that ’s something Paxton failed to do . If I can live with it , then so can you . ”
39981	39988	39989	39989	I	3485	“ I ’m breaking the pact , ”
40013	40024	39989	39989	I	3485	“ And there ’s nothing you can do about it . ”
40124	40134	40135	40135	I	3485	“ Listen , I have options . I do . ”
40142	40192	40193	40193	I	3485	“ I choose to be with Cillian . He may not give me love , but he ’ll give me everything else I ’m looking for . I ’ll be able to start the family I ’ve always wanted , have kids . A place to call my own … ”
40197	40226	40193	40193	I	3485	“ All I ’m asking is for you to support this . It ’s crazy , and insane , and unconventional , but it is still my choice . ”
40268	40301	40247	40247	Belle	485	“ Welp . If you excuse me , I have to go scream at my sister , have a mental breakdown , then accept her decision . See you later , ladies . ”
40399	40408	40409	40409	I	3485	“ How come you did n’t freak out ? ”
40431	40441	40424	40424	Belle	485	“ Sorry , were you expecting a whole production ? ”
40442	40451	40424	40424	Belle	485	“ Expected ? No . Predicted ? Yes . ”
40455	40508	40452	40452	She	485	“ I ’m not Willy Wonka . I do n’t sugarcoat stuff , sis . You know how I feel about Kill Fitzpatrick , but you ’re not a baby anymore . You can make your own decisions , even if I think those decisions should land you in a psychiatric ward . ”
40509	40522	40424	40424	Belle	485	“ That never stopped you from being super protective of me before . ”
40641	40727	40634	40634	she	485	“ I ’ll always have your back . But honestly ? I ’m half - sold on the idea . Paxton left you penniless and heartbroken . I watched you suffer through the past eight months , trying to hold your head up . If you want to switch tactics and marry a wealthy man who will provide for you , I ’ll be the last one to judge you for it . Ultimately , we all make choices to the best of our abilities . ”
40737	40744	40728	40728	She	485	“ There ’s also something else . ”
40759	40798	40799	40799	she	485	“ I know you ’ve never said anything , but I always kind of knew you had a thing for Kill . It was in your eyes when he entered a room . They changed . They glittered , ”
40802	40832	40799	40799	she	485	“ It ’s never too late to change the name of the prince in your story . Just as long as you do n’t end up with the villain . ”
40833	40841	40842	40842	I	3485	“ He ca n’t be the villain . ”
40847	40854	40842	40842	I	3485	“ He ’s already saved me . ”
40855	40863	40864	40864	she	485	“ You know he ca n’t love ? ”
40868	40878	40842	40842	I	3485	“ Love is a luxury not everyone can afford . ”
40879	40894	40842	40842	I	3485	“ Well , if anyone can move mountains , it ’s you , sis . ”
41048	41061	41062	41062	Belle	485	“ You ’re not the naïve little damsel everyone thinks you are . ”
41077	41142	41062	41062	Belle	485	“ You have nails and teeth , and a spine to go with them . Persephone was n’t only a floral maiden . She was also the queen of death . Your groom ’s in for a rude awakening . But know this — if Kill ever tries to play Hades , I ’d descend to the underworld myself to rip his balls off . ”
41143	41147	41148	41148	Byrne	133	“ All there ? ”
41183	41187	41188	41188	Sam	2667	“ Count it , ”
41265	41268	41269	41269	Byrne	133	“ Kam . ”
41304	41315	41290	41290	Byrne	133	“ Count with me , you useless sack of meat . ”
41342	41364	41290	41290	Byrne	133	“ I ’m pleased to say we have no outstanding debts between us , gentlemen . Thank you for your business . ”
41407	41410	41411	41411	Brennan	2667	“ Actually , ”
41414	41424	41411	41411	Brennan	2667	“ we do have one outstanding matter to resolve . ”
41433	41439	41440	41440	Byrne	133	“ What would that be ? ”
41447	41452	41443	41443	Sam	2667	“ Your fucking bones . ”
41468	41477	41478	41478	Sam	2667	“ Can I tell you a little secret ? ”
41509	41562	41493	41494	Colin Byrne	133	“ I ’ve always had a weakness for numbers . Do n’t know what it is about them , Byrne , but they calm me down . They make sense . My son of a bitch sperm donor was good at nothing but numbers . Guess I got the knack from him . ”
41563	41566	41567	41567	Byrne	133	“ Please , ”
41576	41599	41567	41567	Byrne	133	“ I already told you , I did n’t know she was under your protection . I had no idea , man — ”
41600	41629	41630	41630	Sam	2667	“ Stop begging , unless you want me to cut you a nice smile to remind you how cheerful you were when you paid her your weekly visits . ”
41647	41710	41643	41643	his	2667	“ Now , here ’s what this math enthusiast wants to know . Why would a loan shark inflate his interest by two hundred percent when the market standard is fifty ? Is it possible you took advantage of the lovely creature Paxton Veitch had left behind and decided to whore her out , knowing she could make you a fast buck ? ”
41819	41835	41836	41836	Byrne	133	“ Veitch wanted to whore out his wife all by himself before he fucked off ! ”
41848	41903	41836	41836	Byrne	133	“ He wanted to kidnap her and give her to me . I told him not to bother . That I did n’t want the FBI on my tail . Human trafficking will get you a shit - ton of jail time . I even gave the bitch extra time to pay me back . ”
41914	41923	41904	41904	Sam	2667	“ Are you thinking what I ’m thinking ? ”
41924	41933	41934	41934	I	3485	“ We ’re dealing with a patron saint , ”
42060	42089	42090	42090	Sam	2667	“ I just ca n’t help but think that , despite your devout intentions , you could have done without beating the shit out of the poor girl . ”
42138	42143	42144	42144	Byrne	133	“ It was Kaminski ! ”
42150	42179	42144	42144	Byrne	133	“ He did it ! I told him to threaten her , maybe slap her around , but no more . He was the one who hurt her ! ”
42180	42189	42190	42190	I	3485	“ Where ’d you hurt her , Kaminski ? ”
42280	42285	42312	42312	I	3485	“ I … I … ”
42286	42290	42291	42291	I	3485	“ Her eye ? ”
42295	42311	42291	42291	I	3485	“ Why , yes . I do remember my fiancée sporting a nasty black shiner . ”
42357	42366	42367	42367	I	3485	“ I also remember you got her cheek . ”
42376	42380	42367	42367	I	3485	“ Her brow . ”
42383	42387	42367	42367	I	3485	“ The ribs . ”
42390	42396	42367	42367	I	3485	“ Her knees , too . ”
42461	42466	42467	42467	Sam	2667	“ Keep the money . ”
42485	42497	42467	42467	Sam	2667	“ And do n’t ever go near my future wife again . ”
42530	42576	42577	42577	I	3485	“ If I hear you so much as breathed in her direction , there will be hell to pay . In fact , I ’ll be checking in to see you keep your distance from her . If I find you in her zip code … ”
42613	42617	42619	42620	Nick Cave	266	“ Red Right Hand ”
42784	42792	42793	42793	Sam	2667	“ What ’s crawled up your ass ? ”
42808	42812	42813	42813	I	3485	“ Just thinking . ”
42836	42842	42843	42843	Sam	2667	“ My least favorite pastime . ”
42858	42862	42843	42843	Sam	2667	“ What about ? ”
42863	42866	42886	42886	Sam	2667	“ Marriage . ”
42867	42871	42843	42843	Sam	2667	“ More specifically ? ”
42872	42885	42886	42886	Sam	2667	“ The inconvenient necessity of it . What are you waiting for ? ”
42914	42917	42918	42918	He	2667	“ Nothing . ”
42943	43010	42922	42922	Sam	2667	“ I have no plans to get married . It ’s a surprisingly easy decision to make when you have no duty to continue a lineage and your biological parents are a back - stabbing asshole who deserved to die and a whore who left you on her ex - boyfriend ’s doorstep when you were old enough to know what it meant to be abandoned . ”
43011	43019	43020	43020	I	3485	“ Who ’ll inherit everything you own ? ”
43072	43086	43069	43069	Sam	2667	“ Sailor . Her kids , maybe . Money means nothing to me . ”
43091	43102	43103	43103	I	3485	“ But you grew up with Troy and Sparrow Brennan , ”
43125	43131	43117	43118	The man	2667	“ Boston ’s golden couple . ”
43132	43141	43142	43142	Sam	2667	“ Han Solo and Leia Organa on steroids . ”
43153	43213	43142	43142	Sam	2667	“ But that means jack - shit . I have neither Sparrow ’s DNA nor Troy ’s . I ’m an orphan . An elaborated mistake born from vengeance . I have no plans of reproducing . Besides , what good would it be to have a child , knowing I could get locked up for life any day ? ”
43219	43220	43222	43222	his	2667	“ Now”—he
43226	43286	43222	43222	his	2667	direction—“back to business . Byrne and his puppet are out of the picture for good . The next step is to find Veitch . See where he ’s hiding . What he ’s doing . Put him on a leash . Maybe bring him back and throw him into Byrne ’s claws . Kill two birds with one stone . ”
43287	43291	43292	43292	I	3485	“ Leave him . ”
43297	43320	43292	43292	I	3485	“ Byrne is paid . Kaminski will be in a wheelchair for life . Veitch is probably dead . It ’s done . ”
43321	43360	43222	43222	his	2667	“ Dead ? I do n’t think so . I bet you Veitch is alive , and that as soon as he hears his wife got hitched to a billionaire , he ’ll be back , making demands . ”
43361	43365	43366	43366	I	3485	“ Not possible , ”
43369	43403	43366	43366	I	3485	“ The divorce certificate should arrive tomorrow morning . He would n’t be eligible for a penny . I do n’t need to know where Veitch is or what he ’s up to . ”
43404	43420	43222	43222	his	2667	“ He can contact Persephone and play on her heartstrings . He ’s her husband . ”
43421	43424	43366	43366	I	3485	“ Was . ”
43425	43430	43222	43222	his	2667	“ She chose him . ”
43431	43436	43437	43437	I	3485	“ She chose wrong , ”
43440	43462	43463	43463	Sam	2667	“ If anyone ’s prone to take mercy on the asshole who left her behind , it ’s your future wife , ”
43474	43489	43466	43466	I	3485	“ Precisely . Better knock her up before she runs off with her ex . ”
43566	43573	43574	43574	he	2667	“ It ’s an unfinished job , ”
43577	43586	43574	43574	he	2667	“ I do n’t do those , Fitzpatrick . ”
43587	43603	43604	43604	I	3485	“ You ’ll do whatever I tell you to do for your salary , Brennan . ”
43620	43633	43604	43604	I	3485	“ And I ’m telling you to forget Paxton Veitch ever existed . ”
43634	43649	43650	43650	Hunter	489	“ The media is all over this shit like a hooker on a senator . ”
43674	43691	43692	43692	Devon	177	“ Ca n’t blame them . The bride looks like proper royalty . A modern Cinderella . ”
43814	43823	43824	43824	Hunter	489	“ Persy ’s hotter than a Carolina Reaper . ”
43842	43848	43824	43824	Hunter	489	“ You ’ve done well . ”
43849	43855	43856	43856	I	3485	“ She ’s done better . ”
43863	43875	43856	43856	I	3485	“ Her beauty will fade . My Forbes status will not . ”
44023	44059	44060	44060	Hunter	489	“ Still ca n’t believe she agreed to we d your ass . If I did n’t see her saying she accepted your offer with my own eyes , I ’d think you shanghaied her . ”
44174	44208	44209	44209	Devon	177	“ I do n’t give a toss what made her say yes . All I care is that she did . We needed that win . Especially with Andrew Arrowsmith back in town . ”
44267	44277	44278	44278	Devon	278	“ He ’s the new CEO of Green Living , ”
44294	44311	44291	44291	he	278	“ Bollocks . But you already knew that . When were you going to tell me ? ”
44312	44332	44278	44278	Devon	278	“ I was n’t . It ’s your job to keep yourself informed . I ’m not your secretary . ”
44333	44348	44349	44349	Hunter	489	“ Could have fooled me . You ’d look ravishing in a pencil skirt . ”
44369	44383	44384	44384	Devon	278	“ Andrew spent the morning hopping from one morning show to the other , ”
44388	44395	44384	44384	Devon	278	“ He ’s cooking something up . ”
44396	44400	44401	44401	I	3485	“ No doubt , ”
44404	44411	44412	44412	Hunter	489	“ Is Sam on the case ? ”
44454	44458	44459	44459	I	3485	“ Not yet . ”
44465	44485	44459	44459	I	3485	“ I want him to make the first move . See what he ’s got before I destroy him . ”
44516	44520	44530	44530	She	3223	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick ? ”
44521	44529	44493	44493	She	3223	“ Ms. Brandt . Is it Halloween ? ”
44537	44540	44530	44530	She	3223	“ No . ”
44541	44554	44555	44555	I	3485	“ Then do n’t dress like it . What do you want ? ”
44592	44616	44561	44561	She	3223	“ Sorry to interrupt , it ’s just that you have n’t answered my last six emails regarding the engagement and wedding rings . ”
44664	44673	44656	44656	I	3485	“ What kind of diamonds does she like ? ”
44674	44682	44683	44683	Hunter	489	“ How the fuck should I know ? ”
44686	44707	44683	44683	Hunter	489	“ I hang out with the chick . I do n’t choose pantyhose and earrings with her at Bloomingdale ’s . ”
44708	44713	44656	44656	I	3485	“ Ask your wife . ”
44714	44719	44720	44720	he	489	“ Ask your fiancée , ”
44730	44740	44741	44741	I	3485	“ That would require me to talk to her . ”
44757	44766	44741	44741	I	3485	“ I have no desire to do that . ”
44777	44788	44789	44789	He	489	“ How am I supposed to answer something like that ? ”
44801	44838	44789	44789	He	489	“ I ca n’t believe he ’s marrying my wife ’s best friend . What ’s gon na happen if I have to murder him ? Will representing me be a conflict of interest for you ? ”
44839	44842	44843	44843	Devon	278	“ Yes , ”
44851	44876	44843	44843	Devon	278	“ Regardless , I do n’t practice criminal law . Do n’t like to get my hands dirty . May I make a suggestion ? ”
44877	44880	44881	44881	I	3485	“ No , ”
44891	44901	44881	44881	I	3485	“ For the love of God , please do . ”
44902	44910	44911	44911	Devon	278	“ Go with the most expensive option , ”
44914	44942	44943	44943	He	489	“ The answer to every question concerning a woman ’s taste in jewelry is to go with the expensive option . Works like a charm every Christmas . ”
44948	44953	44954	44954	Hunter	489	“ Not with Persephone . ”
44959	44983	44954	44954	Hunter	489	“ She ’s picky and particular . Both Penrose sisters have strong personalities . That ’s why they get along with my wife . ”
45037	45043	44996	44996	Casey	157	“ Get all of them . ”
45044	45049	44996	44996	Casey	157	“ Sorry , sir ? ”
45050	45092	44996	44996	Casey	157	“ The rings the jeweler has sent . Get her all of them . She can choose , alternate , gift some to her annoying friends , donate to charity , wipe her ass with them . I do n’t care . ”
45093	45110	45111	45111	She	157	“ You mean buy her all eight rings the jeweler has flown here from Mumbai overnight ? ”
45135	45143	45111	45111	She	157	“ They cost half a million apiece . ”
45144	45148	45149	45149	I	3485	“ And … ? ”
45169	45180	45149	45149	I	3485	“ And nothing . It will be done , sir . ”
45228	45232	45233	45233	I	3485	“ What now ? ”
45236	45246	45247	45247	Devon	278	“ You could ’ve just gone with any ring , ”
45250	45258	45247	45247	Devon	278	“ Yet you chose all of them . ”
45277	45283	45284	45284	I	3485	“ What ’s your point ? ”
45287	45289	45293	45293	his	278	“ His point”—Hunter
45299	45359	45293	45293	his	278	standing—“is that you , my dear brother , are about to get punched right in the feels . Bubble - wrap that black heart of yours because shit ’s about to get real , and I ’m going to grab a front - row seat when you finally realize you are not the soulless bastard you think you are . ”
45360	45369	45370	45370	Devon	278	“ Save me a place next to you . ”
45889	45916	45879	45879	Hunter	489	“ Personally , I ’d prefer to hand you over to Vlad the Impaler , but I ’m too scared for my life to deny Kill anything ”
45919	45924	45925	45925	Ash	120	“ Knock , knock . ”
45957	45960	45961	45961	I	3485	“ Hey . ”
46002	46015	45994	45994	Ash	120	“ A good luck charm for the bride . A Fitzpatrick tradition . ”
46016	46022	46023	46023	My	3485	“ Is this from Kill ? ”
46062	46102	46045	46045	Ash	120	“ My bad . I should ’ve clarified . I made it for you . It ’s an Irish custom that the bride braids the crown in her hair on her own . Brings good luck to the marriage . ”
46103	46114	46115	46115	I	3485	“ My hair is harder than a rock right now , ”
46119	46126	46127	46127	Belle	485	“ Is this bitch for real ? ”
46137	46173	46127	46127	Belle	485	“ Sis , you need all the luck you can get . You ’re putting this thing on if it ’s the last thing you do . And while you ’re at it , here . ”
46205	46210	46211	46211	I	3485	“ What ’s that ? ”
46217	46226	46187	46187	She	485	“ A little pick - me - up . ”
46251	46268	46269	46269	Aisling	106	“ The church is jam - packed . All the pews are filled to the brim . ”
46287	46323	46269	46269	Aisling	106	“ Sam locked the church doors on Kill , another Irish tradition to make sure the groom does n’t run away , and Hunter slipped a sixpence into his shoes . Kill was n’t happy . ”
46324	46330	46331	46331	Sailor	772	“ When is he ever ? ”
46384	46395	46396	46396	I	3485	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m getting married again , ”
46406	46417	46418	46418	Sailor	772	“ It ’s not too late to change your mind , ”
46422	46433	46418	46418	Sailor	772	“ Really . Ask any Julia Roberts movie out there . ”
46434	46439	46440	46440	Belle	485	“ Cut it out , ”
46446	46465	46440	46440	Belle	485	“ We ’re going to give the asshole the benefit of the doubt , at least for today . ”
46466	46471	46472	46472	Sailor	772	“ You ’re right . ”
46478	46483	46472	46472	Sailor	772	“ Sorry , Pers . ”
46495	46534	46484	46486	The event coordinator	1371	“ We ’re all set . My God , you look like a movie star , Persephone . Hunter is waiting for you by the church ’s doors . He is the person giving you away , correct ? ”
46535	46538	46539	46539	Belle	485	“ Actually , ”
46548	46558	46539	46539	Belle	485	“ we ’re all going to give her away . ”
46559	46562	46563	46563	Sailor	772	“ Reluctantly . ”
46699	46706	46694	46696	A live band	1377	“ Arrival of the Queen of Sheba ”
46845	46863	46864	46864	Sailor	772	“ Did he tell you he does n’t have any feelings ? He takes pride in that . ”
47005	47021	47022	47022	He	508	“ Before we proceed , the groom has a few words he wants to say . ”
47058	47104	47036	47037	Kill Fitzpatrick	3067	“ Love is a fickle emotion , Persephone my dear . Fortuitous , unreliable , and prone to changes . People fall in and out of love at the drop of a hat . They get divorced . They cheat . They get cheated on . ”
47171	47216	47217	47217	He	1386	“ The thing is , you ca n’t rely on love . Which is why I intend to offer you something far more consistent . Commitment , friendship , and loyalty . I promise to give you my protection , no matter the price . ”
47250	47306	47307	47307	He	1386	“ I will never turn my back on us . We will fall in and out of love many times , but I promise to find my way back to you . To put us back together even when the temptation to break things off is too much . And when love feels far away … ”
47320	47331	47307	47307	He	1386	“ I will bring it right back to our doorstep . ”
47392	47398	47399	47400	The reverend	1391	“ This is … beautiful . ”
47422	47443	47444	47444	He	1391	“ I pronounce you husband and wife . You may now kiss the bride . God knows you want to . ”
47545	47550	47551	47551	he	1391	“ Kiss me back , ”
47828	47832	47833	47833	he	1400	“ Now now , ”
47839	47867	47833	47833	he	1400	“ You ’re not going to get the fairy tale , Flower Girl , so you might as well sell it to other people . Smile big . ”
47868	47876	47877	47877	I	3485	“ You ’re not my Prince Charming , ”
47906	47912	47899	47899	I	3485	“ You ’re the villain . ”
47913	47920	47921	47921	He	3485	“ Fear is my greatest asset . ”
47943	47958	47921	47921	He	3485	“ But what are villains , my dear wife , if not misunderstood heroes ? ”
48451	48457	48458	48458	Kill	3067	“ The wedding went smoothly , ”
48517	48525	48526	48526	I	3485	“ I ’m glad you think so . ”
48566	48574	48604	48604	I	3485	“ Is the apartment to your satisfaction ? ”
48575	48584	48585	48585	I	3485	“ Tonight will be my first night there , ”
48589	48600	48585	48585	I	3485	“ I ’m sure I ’m going to love it . ”
48738	48764	48765	48765	I	3485	“ Why did you ask the orchestra to play ‘ The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba ? ’ Why not ‘ Bridal Chorus ? ’ ”
48769	48776	48765	48765	I	3485	“ I do n’t like Wagner . ”
48777	48783	48784	48784	I	3485	“ Because he is loved ? ”
48787	48796	48797	48797	he	600	“ No , because he was a Nazi , ”
48810	48813	48765	48765	I	3485	“ Interesting . ”
48814	48828	48765	48765	I	3485	“ Not particularly . You may want to broaden your pool of interests . ”
48837	48871	48765	48765	I	3485	“ So you do n’t consume products that are loosely connected to racism . By that logic , you do n’t drive a Ford , wear Hugo Boss , or use Kodak products . ”
48872	48890	48765	48765	I	3485	“ I drive an Aston Martin , wear Kiton and Brioni , and no to using Kodak . ”
48891	48905	48765	48765	I	3485	“ Careful , hubs , or I ’ll suspect you have a soul . ”
48906	48925	48765	48765	I	3485	“ Nobody has a soul . What I have is a few working brain cells and loose principles . ”
48926	48932	48933	48933	I	3485	“ Nobody has a soul ? ”
48938	48961	48933	48933	I	3485	“ I know you do n’t believe in feelings , or God , but you do n’t believe in souls , either ? ”
48962	48966	48967	48967	He	3485	“ Do you ? ”
48987	48991	48992	48992	I	3485	“ Of course , ”
48997	49003	49004	49004	His	3485	“ Where is it then ? ”
49013	49019	49004	49004	His	3485	“ Your soul . Anatomically . ”
49020	49049	49088	49088	his	3485	“ Just because you ca n’t see something does n’t mean it ’s not in existence . Take air , for instance . Or intelligence . Or love . ”
49050	49071	49004	49004	His	3485	“ The fact you shove the L - word into every conversation says a lot about you , you know . ”
49072	49085	49088	49088	his	3485	“ There are no facts , Cillian my dear . Only interpretations . ”
49097	49100	49004	49004	His	3485	“ Nietzsche . ”
49101	49107	49108	49108	I	3485	“ I married a nihilist . ”
49139	49165	49120	49120	I	3485	“ The least I could do before saying I do was to take a tour in that mind of yours . Understand your moral compass . ”
49166	49181	49182	49182	You	1436	“ I have no morals . That ’s the point of being a nihilist . ”
49286	49289	49246	49246	He	1440	“ Persephone . ”
49303	49313	49290	49290	I	3485	“ We still have n’t discussed the conception part . ”
49314	49353	49300	49300	his	1440	“ There ’s nothing to discuss . You can start taking my calls . Better yet — call me when you ’re ready to start trying . We can hit the road running and get pregnant by summer . ”
49410	49424	49425	49425	Kill	3067	“ What are my chances of convincing you to go the IVF route ? ”
49430	49433	49434	49434	I	3485	“ Nonexistent , ”
49438	49444	49434	49434	I	3485	“ We have a deal . ”
49445	49464	49425	49425	Kill	3067	“ Fine . I ’ll have someone send over ovulation tests . Call me when you ’re ready . ”
49465	49473	49434	49434	I	3485	“ That ’s a no from me . ”
49474	49478	49479	49479	He	3067	“ Excuse me ? ”
49514	49530	49531	49531	I	3485	“ I do n’t want to take tests . I like the element of surprise . ”
49538	49552	49557	49557	he	3067	“ Is there a point to having sex if you are not ovulating ? ”
49581	49585	49586	49586	I	3485	“ There is , ”
49590	49595	49586	49586	I	3485	“ Do share it . ”
49596	49601	49586	49586	I	3485	“ I ’ll orgasm . ”
49655	49666	49647	49647	His	142	“ Sexual favors were n’t a part of our negotiation . ”
49667	49671	49672	49672	I	3485	“ Sue me . ”
49686	49740	49672	49672	I	3485	“ Look , if you do n’t want to touch me this much , do n’t bother . You do n’t have to sleep with me , Kill . But if you want me to give you a baby , that ’s the route you ’ll have to take . And another thing . ”
49835	49848	49822	49822	He	142	“ You , my darling husband , kiss like a hungry Rottweiler . ”
49852	49875	49822	49822	He	142	“ You really need to work on your tongue - to - lips ratio . And you use way too much saliva . ”
49904	49912	49913	49913	I	3485	“ I guess I can teach you . ”
49919	49923	49913	49913	I	3485	“ Hard pass . ”
49924	49928	49876	49876	He	142	“ But you — ”
49929	49963	49913	49913	I	3485	“ Drop it , Persephone . In order to insult me , I ’ll first have to value your opinion , and as established five minutes ago , I do n’t value anything . ”
49964	49968	49876	49876	He	142	“ Your loss . ”
49969	49975	49913	49913	I	3485	“ Never heard any complaints . ”
49976	49983	49876	49876	He	142	“ Of course you have n’t ! ”
49998	50013	49876	49876	He	142	“ You do n’t pay them to grade you . Good night , hubs . ”
50510	50513	50514	50514	I	3485	“ Devon . ”
50520	50529	50514	50514	I	3485	“ To what do I owe the displeasure ? ”
50530	50554	50502	50502	My	3485	“ I ’d say to being a world - class cunt and collecting enemies around the globe like they were Royal Mail stamps . ”
50555	50561	50562	50562	I	3485	“ I pissed someone off , ”
50565	50568	50502	50502	My	3485	“ Correct . ”
50569	50576	50502	50502	My	3485	“ You ’ll need to specify . ”
50577	50583	50502	50502	My	3485	“ Look out your window . ”
50584	50630	50502	50502	My	3485	“ Already did . Not my best picture , but I just redirected three mill to PR and advertising to buy this spot — and all the others in the city — and replace it the moment Andrew ’s lease is done with positive ads . ”
50631	50660	50502	50502	My	3485	“ The sodding billboard is nothing . Your old mate , Andrew Arrowsmith , went for a grander gesture to profess his hate for you . Look down . ”
50770	50779	50751	50751	I	3485	“ How did I not know about this ? ”
50780	50812	50751	50751	I	3485	“ It ’s a spontaneous demonstration . They did n’t clear it with the police . It ’ll disperse in the next hour or so . I already made some calls . ”
50813	50819	50820	50820	I	3485	“ And where is Arrowsmith ? ”
50824	50828	50833	50833	Devon	278	“ Town hall . ”
50846	50870	50833	50833	Devon	278	“ He ’s filing a public lawsuit against Royal Pipelines for drilling exploratory wells in the Arctic . He wants them shut down . ”
50871	50877	50878	50878	I	3485	“ How worried am I ? ”
50911	50929	50930	50930	Devon	278	“ Considerably . You own the land , but Andrew is suggesting some amendments to international laws , ”
50933	50940	50930	50930	Devon	278	“ What ’s your game plan ? ”
50941	50965	50966	50966	I	3485	“ Make him lose his pants by prolonging the trial until Green Living wo n’t be able to afford a package of lettuce , ”
50973	50983	50984	50984	Devon	278	“ That ’d stall him , not stop him . ”
50988	51002	50984	50984	Devon	278	“ I ’m on my way . Meet me on the fourth floor . ”
51042	51045	51046	51046	Devon	278	“ Kill ? ”
51058	51072	51046	51046	Devon	278	“ Arrowsmith made a bloody good move . We might need to negotiate . ”
51073	51081	51035	51035	Andrew	278	“ I do n’t negotiate with terrorists . ”
51602	51607	51608	51608	Hunter	489	“ Hey , bro . ”
51624	51637	51608	51608	Hunter	489	“ ’ Sup ? You look like someone pissed in your soup . ”
51674	51677	51678	51678	she	3162	“ Kill , ”
51708	51714	51715	51715	I	3485	“ How have you been ? ”
51719	51722	51726	51726	sweetheart	3485	“ Great . ”
51728	51735	51723	51723	I	3485	“ May I have a word ? ”
51759	51766	51767	51767	Sailor	772	“ Is the honeymoon phase over ? ”
51773	51789	51767	51767	Sailor	772	“ Oh , that ’s right . Kill did n’t take Persy on a honeymoon . ”
51790	51800	51801	51801	Belle	485	“ Do n’t make me take off my earrings . ”
51810	51830	51801	51801	Belle	485	“ Kill will get killed if he messes with my baby sister . I ’ve already told him that . ”
52066	52076	52063	52063	her	772	“ All right , hubs . Make it quick . ”
52120	52127	52106	52106	I	3485	“ What are you doing here ? ”
52128	52134	52135	52135	She	772	“ Having lunch with friends . ”
52157	52165	52153	52153	my	3485	“ Having a good day , hubs ? ”
52166	52170	52135	52135	She	772	“ Not particularly . ”
52171	52184	52185	52185	She	772	“ Yeah , I saw in the local news about the demonstration . ”
52203	52216	52185	52185	She	772	“ That billboard up there is n’t your best angle , either . ”
52297	52307	52308	52308	She	772	“ What you ’re doing in the Arctic is … ”
52316	52319	52320	52320	I	3485	“ Terrible ? ”
52328	52331	52308	52308	She	772	“ Monstrous . ”
52332	52338	52308	52308	She	772	“ Cry me a river . ”
52339	52352	52308	52308	She	772	“ You ’ll probably find a way to pollute it , too . ”
52353	52388	52389	52389	I	3485	“ A bit of loyalty would n’t kill you , Flower Girl . I ’m your husband . Although that ’s not saying much , considering you divorced the previous one without his consent . ”
52407	52427	52403	52403	Her	772	“ Are you kidding me ? You ’re comparing my divorcing my runaway husband to what you ’re doing ? ”
52454	52494	52446	52446	my	3485	“ You ’re ruining our planet for financial gain . The Earth is not your wasteland . Not to mention , you ’re driving entire animal groups into extinction . The polar bears and the penguins come to mind . ”
52495	52504	52505	52505	I	3485	“ I ’m sorry you feel that way , ”
52526	52533	52446	52446	my	3485	“ No , you ’re not . ”
52534	52555	52446	52446	my	3485	“ You ’re right . I ’m not sorry at all . You ca n’t run your car on adorable . ”
52556	52570	52571	52571	she	1504	“ But I can run it on batteries , thanks to Elon Musk , ”
52579	52602	52446	52446	my	3485	“ I know women are fond of battery - operated devices , but they ’re never as good as the real thing . ”
52717	52726	52735	52735	her	1504	“ Why are you really here , Persephone ? ”
52810	52813	52814	52814	She	1504	“ Lunch . ”
52820	52828	52814	52814	She	1504	“ Why else would I be here ? ”
52859	52871	52814	52814	She	1504	“ I think you ’re here because you owe me something . ”
52872	52916	52917	52917	She	1504	“ I ’m giving you everything I signed on for . I live in the apartment you ’ve designated for me . I ’m available to you . I do n’t remember you picking up the phone and asking to consummate our marriage . ”
52971	52977	52978	52978	I	3485	“ I do n’t beg , ”
52981	53015	53016	53016	She	1504	“ No one asked you to . But if you want to get into my bed , you ’ll need to make the required arrangements . It ’s not too much to ask . ”
53039	53045	53046	53046	I	3485	“ You ’re here now , ”
53085	53104	53072	53072	She	1504	“ We ’re not having sex in your bathroom . I have more self - respect than that . ”
53105	53110	53111	53111	I	3485	“ Are you sure ? ”
53122	53149	53111	53111	I	3485	“ So far , you ’ve acted like a glorified mail - order bride . Bending over the vanity would be well within your typical behavior . ”
53171	53176	53164	53165	my wife	772	“ Goodbye , hubs . ”
53279	53282	53283	53283	I	3485	“ Persephone , ”
53289	53293	53265	53265	her	1504	“ Turn around . ”
53294	53297	53265	53265	her	1504	“ No . ”
53298	53308	53265	53265	her	1504	“ Do n’t make me teach you a lesson . ”
53309	53312	53313	53313	she	1504	“ Why ? ”
53317	53361	53313	53313	she	1504	“ I ’m a good student . Although I think I ’m the one who is giving you a valuable class today . If you want me to stay , you ’re going to have to ask nicely and not order me around . ”
53455	53460	53450	53450	I	3485	“ Please turn around . ”
53532	53542	53543	53543	I	3485	“ Would you like to have dinner with me ? ”
53547	53550	53551	53551	Her	1504	“ Yes . ”
53563	53567	53551	53551	Her	1504	“ Tonight okay ? ”
53568	53573	53551	53551	Her	1504	“ Tonight ’s fine . ”
53574	53583	53551	53551	Her	1504	“ Why do n’t I cook for us ? ”
53615	53628	53551	53551	Her	1504	“ I have a private chef . We can also order in . ”
53634	53643	53629	53629	She	1504	“ Nothing beats a home - cooked meal . ”
53644	53659	53660	53660	I	3485	“ Where do you think my chef cooks my meals ? Not the bathroom , ”
53672	53682	53669	53669	She	1504	“ Your chef does n’t cook with their heart . ”
53683	53686	53687	53687	I	3485	“ Fortunately , ”
53690	53699	53687	53687	I	3485	“ that would be unhygienic . Any preferences ? ”
53752	53772	53778	53779	this woman	1206	“ Do n’t worry about my preferences . Just let me do the cooking . I have one stipulation . ”
53865	53868	53887	53889	a sentimental man	1523	“ Well ? ”
53869	53879	53887	53889	a sentimental man	1523	“ I want it to be at your place . ”
53880	53883	53887	53889	a sentimental man	1523	“ Done . ”
53934	53940	53941	53941	She	1206	“ See you at seven . ”
54315	54324	54325	54325	Petar	142	“ Holy fu … what ’s that smell ? ”
54413	54424	54425	54425	I	3485	“ I ’m trying to make lemon chicken and risotto . ”
54437	54447	54425	54425	I	3485	“ I guess trying is the operative word here . ”
54541	54551	54552	54552	Petar	142	“ Remind me why you insisted on making dinner ? ”
54602	54611	54596	54596	I	3485	“ I wanted to have a special evening . ”
54612	54620	54621	54621	Petar	142	“ It ’s special , all right . ”
54633	54660	54661	54661	Petar	142	“ I ’ll call the maintenance guy . See if he can start working on the kitchen tonight if I throw in a few extra bucks . ”
54667	54683	54661	54661	Petar	142	“ Although I got ta say , the boss is not gon na be happy . ”
54684	54694	54661	54661	Petar	142	“ Why am I not going to be happy ? ”
54810	54817	54818	54818	I	3485	“ I burned down your kitchen . ”
54876	54879	54862	54862	He	600	“ Deliberately ? ”
54880	54883	54862	54862	He	600	“ No . ”
54884	54889	54862	54862	He	600	“ Are you hurt ? ”
54903	54906	54897	54897	I	3485	“ No . ”
54946	54949	54929	54929	He	600	“ Out . ”
54950	54955	54929	54929	He	600	“ Yes , sir . ”
55061	55068	55041	55041	He	600	“ What was on the menu ? ”
55069	55075	55041	55041	He	600	“ Lemon chicken and risotto . ”
55076	55084	55041	55041	He	600	“ What the hell were you thinking ? ”
55095	55103	55104	55104	I	3485	“ Maybe I wanted to poison you . ”
55118	55145	55104	55104	I	3485	“ The only person you ’re capable of poisoning is yourself , as demonstrated a few years ago . Even then , you botched the job . ”
55146	55164	55104	55104	I	3485	“ Hey , I did a great job . It ’s not my fault you saved me . ”
55165	55172	55173	55173	He	600	“ I still have my regrets . ”
55192	55239	55173	55173	He	600	“ Here ’s the thing . You had your stab at cooking dinner , and you blew it . I have a poker game in a couple of hours . Which means we ’ll have to skip the first course and get straight to the entrée . ”
55240	55248	55249	55249	I	3485	“ You scheduled a poker game tonight ? ”
55285	55306	55307	55307	he	600	“ You were n’t planning on spooning in front of When Harry Met Sally , were you , Flower Girl ? ”
55431	55435	55414	55414	he	600	“ A condom ? ”
55439	55459	55414	55414	he	600	“ Lube . As I mentioned before , getting you off is not a part of my job description . ”
55460	55467	55468	55468	I	3485	“ I ’m not a whore . ”
55473	55477	55478	55478	he	600	“ Sex worker , ”
55482	55511	55478	55478	he	600	“ Trust me , no one mistakes you for one . If you were an escort , I ’d flip you over and plow into you by now . ”
55516	55525	55512	55512	My	3485	“ You ’re getting your paid company off ? ”
55526	55529	55414	55414	he	600	“ Unfailingly . ”
55530	55533	55512	55512	My	3485	“ Why ? ”
55534	55591	55414	55414	he	600	“ Because it ’s the right thing to do . And because there is absolutely zero chance of my forming any attachment to them or vice versa . It is not too late for IVF , Persephone . Do the right thing and leave the dirty fucks for the mistresses . You ’re better than that . ”
55743	55746	55747	55747	I	3485	“ Fine . ”
55757	55761	55747	55747	I	3485	“ You win . ”
55772	55788	55762	55762	He	600	“ I know an excellent fertility expert . Dr. Waxman . I ’ll see that — ”
55789	55805	55806	55806	I	3485	“ No . I meant I ’m fine with the lube . Hand it over . ”
55843	55847	55838	55838	I	3485	“ Go on . ”
55848	55854	55855	55855	he	600	“ You wo n’t come , ”
55870	55887	55858	55858	I	3485	“ Let me tell you a little secret , Kill . We women often do n’t . ”
55888	55893	55858	55858	I	3485	“ You ’re stubborn . ”
55894	55899	55900	55900	I	3485	“ So are you , ”
55903	55914	55900	55900	I	3485	“ How far are you going to take this thing ? ”
55915	55923	55924	55924	he	600	“ A mile further than you will , ”
55928	55936	55924	55924	he	600	“ I never lose , Flower Girl . ”
55937	55946	55900	55900	I	3485	“ There ’s a first time for everything . ”
55947	55952	55924	55924	he	600	“ Not with me . ”
55953	55966	55967	55967	I	3485	“ I guess only time will tell . Hand me the lube , ”
55970	55981	55967	55967	I	3485	“ Rules are rules , and we had an agreement . ”
56474	56478	56479	56479	I	3485	“ Nice kitchen , ”
56525	56533	56534	56534	He	142	“ Did you get it remodeled recently ? ”
56626	56632	56633	56633	I	3485	“ We fit so good , ”
56732	56735	56738	56738	his	142	“ Kill . ”
56925	56928	56929	56929	I	3485	“ Cillian , ”
57147	57150	57151	57151	I	3485	“ Cillian ? ”
57373	57376	57392	57392	he	142	“ Kill ? ”
57380	57385	57392	57392	he	142	“ Are you okay ? ”
57565	57573	57574	57574	I	3485	“ I ’m sorry I pushed you , ”
57606	57623	57636	57636	his	142	“ Would you like me to get you a glass of water ? Maybe call Petar ? ”
57639	57642	57636	57636	his	142	“ Leave . ”
57643	57653	57654	57654	I	3485	“ I do n’t want to leave like this . ”
57662	57674	57654	57654	I	3485	“ Your friends are about to be here , and I — ”
57675	57678	57679	57679	he	142	“ Leave ! ”
57821	57893	57800	57800	He	142	“ You got what you wanted . Now get out of my house and do n’t come back until I call for you . If you do n’t get out of here in the next five minutes , I ’ll assume you want to see your husband ’s true colors and get fucked in front of my friends on the poker table , slowly and all evening , while they watch . ”
57942	57954	57955	57955	He	142	“ You think you escaped a bad relationship by marrying me . ”
57962	57987	57955	57955	He	142	“ You have no idea , Flower Girl . I pay them because fucking me is not a pleasure , it ’s a job . Now”—he
57989	57991	57955	57955	He	142	close—“run . ”
58037	58047	58048	58048	My	3485	“ Can you call me a cab ? Please ? ”
58058	58065	58048	58048	My	3485	“ I ’ll get the driver . ”
58623	58632	58633	58633	I	3485	“ What do I do , Auntie Tilda ? ”
59921	59937	59938	59938	He	2667	“ I ’m surprised Hunter agreed to spend an entire weekend away from his missus . ”
59956	59968	59969	59969	Hunter	489	“ What can I say ? I ’m full of surprises . ”
59975	59979	59980	59980	Sam	2667	“ And shit , ”
59984	59988	59989	59989	Devon	278	“ And yourself . ”
60010	60020	60021	60021	Hunter	489	“ Dev , can you check Kill ’s temperature ? ”
60029	60051	60021	60021	Hunter	489	“ He just missed a chance to slag me off , as your people call it . It ’s unlike him . ”
60052	60075	60076	60076	Devon	278	“ Very few things would make me touch your twat of a brother , and you are definitely not on the list , ”
60160	60191	60153	60153	He	760	“ In my defense , you should n’t have trusted me . I ca n’t stay celibate for an afternoon , let alone an entire weekend . Everyone knows that . ”
60432	60438	60439	60439	She	772	“ What ’s his name ? ”
60467	60470	60471	60471	I	3485	“ Washington . ”
60485	60505	60471	60471	I	3485	“ The rest of these rascals are Hamilton , Franklin , Adams , Jefferson , Madison , and Jay . ”
60506	60511	60512	60512	She	772	“ The Founding Fathers . ”
60533	60546	60547	60547	I	3485	“ Congratulations , you just passed a third - grade history exam . ”
60561	60564	60565	60565	she	772	“ Fifth , ”
60580	60585	60586	60586	I	3485	“ I studied abroad , ”
60601	60605	60606	60606	she	772	“ I know , ”
60610	60640	60606	60606	she	772	“ Unlike our children , who will be staying right next to us until they are old enough to make up their minds about where they want to study . ”
60653	60661	60662	60662	I	3485	“ Over your dead body , huh ? ”
60674	60677	60678	60678	she	772	“ No , ”
60682	60686	60678	60678	she	772	“ Over yours . ”
60700	60711	60712	60713	my wife	772	“ That ’s a lot of horses for one man , ”
60716	60740	60712	60713	my wife	772	“ They ’re beautiful , but some of them seem quite old . Gray - faced . Do you ride all of them ? ”
60741	60751	60792	60792	She	772	“ Yes . They ’re all in pristine condition . ”
60769	60791	60712	60713	my wife	772	“ My father gifted me a horse for every year I finished top of my class , starting in middle school . ”
60798	60808	60809	60809	Her	772	“ Is n’t being perfect all the time tiring ? ”
60827	60835	60792	60792	She	772	“ What kind of question is that ? ”
60836	60845	60865	60865	her	772	“ One I ’d like an answer to . ”
60846	60852	60792	60792	She	772	“ Is being average boring ? ”
60853	60856	60857	60857	she	772	“ No , ”
60868	60928	60857	60857	she	772	“ Then again , I do n’t think I ’m boring at all . I think I ’m exactly who I was supposed to grow up to be , flaws and all . My parents always encouraged me to pursue my dream , and my dream was to raise children . Other people ’s as well as my own . ”
60929	61012	60857	60857	she	772	“ Well , I enjoyed the opposite treatment . Everything about my arrival in this world was carefully planned . I came first , and I was male , which meant the expectations from me were complete and utter perfection in all aspects of my life . I knew I was going to carry the Fitzpatrick bloodline , take over Royal Pipelines , continue the lineage . My existence has always had a purpose , and nothing short of excellence will do . ”
61013	61021	61093	61093	she	1649	“ You ’re not perfect with me . ”
61022	61033	61034	61034	I	3485	“ What you witnessed last week was lack of discretion . ”
61039	61045	61034	61034	I	3485	“ It was n’t pretty . ”
61046	61064	61093	61093	she	1649	“ No . But we ’re all ugly in certain parts , and I ’m still here . ”
61071	61075	61076	61076	She	1649	“ Come inside . ”
61109	61114	61105	61105	Jane	181	“ Food ’s ready . ”
61124	61128	61093	61093	she	1649	“ Not hungry . ”
61129	61138	61093	61093	she	1649	“ Where are you going to sleep tonight ? ”
61139	61144	61093	61093	she	1649	“ The master bedroom . ”
61145	61154	61093	61093	she	1649	“ Where am I going to sleep tonight ? ”
61155	61174	61093	61093	she	1649	“ Any of the six guest rooms . I own this place , so you get first choice . ”
61175	61181	61182	61182	she	1649	“ I choose your bedroom , ”
61189	61197	61198	61198	I	3485	“ First choice other than my bed , ”
61201	61207	61208	61208	she	1649	“ Our friends will talk , ”
61211	61238	61239	61239	I	3485	“ They have the irritating tendency to do that . Everyone knows ours is a sham marriage . No one ’s going to buy your charade . ”
61331	61339	61340	61340	She	1649	“ I made a mistake coming here . ”
61415	61431	61432	61433	My wife	772	“ You did . I will only have you on my terms , Flower Girl . ”
61441	61451	61432	61433	My wife	772	“ That was n’t a part of our contract . ”
61473	61477	61463	61463	she	772	“ Sue me . ”
61478	61491	61492	61492	Devon	278	“ The lawsuit is airtight . I read through it several times . ”
61544	61578	61532	61532	I	3485	“ I ’ve spent an unholy amount on money on the Arctic offshore development . I ’m not canning this project because Arrowsmith has a hard - on to see me go bankrupt . ”
61579	61586	61587	61587	Hunter	489	“ We wo n’t go bankrupt , ”
61625	61671	61604	61605	a brother	797	“ I looked at the numbers . Stopping the drilling in the Arctic is going to hurt our pocket , but we can take the blow . The capital growth will stop for the next four years , but we will still be making money . ”
61672	61690	61691	61691	I	3485	“ I ’m not here to make money . I ’m here to take over the world . ”
61697	61705	61706	61706	Devon	278	“ You might not have a choice , ”
61709	61771	61706	61706	Devon	278	“ If you lose the lawsuit , you ’d have to stop anyway . And have plenty of legal bills to pay , another PR disaster on your hands , and a father who ’d kick you out of the CEO position , turn the board against you , and appoint Hunter to run the show . No offense , Hunt . ”
61772	61776	61777	61777	Hunter	489	“ None taken . ”
61780	61802	61803	61803	He	489	“ I do n’t want to be CEO . You know what this kind of pressure can do to my skin ? ”
61811	61831	61832	61832	Sam	2667	“ We can always think outside the box . And by that , I mean put Arrowsmith in one . ”
61865	61889	61890	61890	He	489	“ I ’ve a feeling I do n’t want to be here for this conversation . Allow me to excuse myself , gentlemen . ”
61918	61957	61899	61899	Sam	2667	“ Regretfully , you ca n’t kill Arrowsmith . The blowback would be huge , all arrows would point at me , and the media would have a field day . Not to mention , Arrowsmith has children . ”
61958	61971	61972	61972	Sam	2667	“ When did you grow a conscience and start caring about children ? ”
61975	61999	61899	61899	Sam	2667	“ You have n’t met the little devils . If something happens to their parents , no one would want to adopt them . ”
62000	62015	61899	61899	Sam	2667	“ Fine . He can live . I can still throw my weight around . ”
62016	62025	62026	62026	I	3485	“ Physical extortion wo n’t get you far . ”
62034	62063	62026	62026	I	3485	“ He ’s got something on me , and I ’m waiting to see how he ’s going to use it . We need to play this carefully . ”
62064	62072	62073	62073	Hunter	489	“ What does he have on you ? ”
62077	62095	62073	62073	Hunter	489	“ You ’re disgustingly perfect . Dad ’s fucking mo òrga . What could it possibly be ? ”
62099	62114	62096	62096	I	3485	“ We have to keep it clean . Let ’s leave it at that . ”
62115	62131	62132	62132	Sam	2667	“ In that case , I ’m with Whitehall on trying to squash that beef , ”
62142	62179	62132	62132	Sam	2667	“ He is going ahead with the lawsuit . You can get him in a few months when things calm down . In the meantime , your best shot is finding common ground with Green Living . ”
62180	62186	62187	62188	My brother	760	“ Cillian will never cower . ”
62193	62199	62200	62200	Sam	2667	“ Retreating is not submitting . ”
62203	62246	62200	62200	Sam	2667	“ If Kill wants to win this thing , he has to play it smart . This is round one out of many . History does n’t remember the battle . Only the name of the man who threw the final knockout . ”
62465	62475	62476	62476	Aisling	106	“ But you do n’t know how to ride . ”
62501	62527	62528	62528	She	485	“ So ? You can teach me . Besides , I ’ve done my fair share of riding in my life , just not bareback . ”
62531	62535	62528	62528	She	485	“ Safety first . ”
62536	62542	62543	62543	Sailor	772	“ Thanks for ruining breakfast . ”
62552	62565	62566	62566	Belle	485	“ Seriously , though , who goes to a ranch without riding ? ”
62575	62587	62588	62588	Ash	120	“ Cillian wo n’t like it if we use his horses , ”
62591	62598	62599	62599	I	3485	“ Cillian does n’t like anything , ”
62614	62662	62607	62607	Sailor	772	“ Preach . I actually think it ’s a great idea . Not only because it would piss off Persy ’s husband , but also because an opportunity to ride horses like Cillian ’s does n’t come often . Each of them costs like 300k or something . Unfortunately”—she
62666	62693	62607	62607	Sailor	772	belly—“riding is off the table for me . But I ’ll cheer you on with a bag of Cheetos in hand . Live vicariously through you . ”
62725	62737	62738	62738	I	3485	“ Actually , I agree . I think we should ride , ”
62741	62744	62745	62748	Everyone at the table	1677	“ Really ? ”
62802	62806	62807	62807	Ash	120	“ But Cillian — ”
62810	62816	62817	62817	I	3485	“ I ’ll handle him . ”
62825	62839	62817	62817	I	3485	“ Tell him I held you at gunpoint if it comes to it . ”
62840	62845	62846	62846	Aisling	106	“ Well , then . ”
62852	62866	62846	62846	Aisling	106	“ Let ’s get changed and meet at the stables in an hour . ”
62918	62939	62956	62956	Belle	485	“ He ’s the sweetest out of the bunch . He was my training horse after I graduated from ponies . ”
62940	62955	62956	62956	Belle	485	“ Dang , Ash . That ’s the whitest thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
63044	63051	63052	63052	Aisling	106	“ You ’re riding , too ? ”
63109	63112	63113	63113	Hunter	489	“ Bet . ”
63122	63129	63113	63113	Hunter	489	“ Where ’s my better half ? ”
63130	63137	63113	63113	Hunter	489	“ In the cabin , reading . ”
63138	63171	63113	63113	Hunter	489	“ Bomb . The only stud she should be hanging out with while preggers is me . Dev , can you help Belle get on a horse ? I ’ll do Persy . ”
63172	63180	63181	63181	Belle	485	“ I do n’t need any help , ”
63207	63215	63216	63216	Devon	177	“ I like her fire , Hunt . ”
63224	63227	63228	63228	she	485	“ Great , ”
63231	63248	63228	63228	she	485	“ because you ’re about to get third - degree burns if you keep objectifying me . ”
63249	63256	63257	63257	Hunter	489	“ He ’s not objectifying you . ”
63262	63278	63257	63257	Hunter	489	“ He ’s trying to keep you alive . Your ass has never ridden before . ”
63279	63287	63288	63288	I	3485	“ We have Ash to help us . ”
63347	63387	63320	63320	He	314	“ Ash is good , but she ’s not a professional . If I bring you back with as much as a scratch , your husband will make me bleed from places that are n’t even on my body . ”
63388	63393	63394	63394	Aisling	106	“ He is right . ”
63398	63409	63394	63394	Aisling	106	“ Both about my horseback riding abilities and about Kill . ”
63410	63416	63320	63320	He	314	“ Cillian ignores my existence . ”
63417	63423	63424	63424	Sam	2667	“ You ’re still his , ”
63429	63451	63424	63424	Sam	2667	“ I do n’t need to be physically present in my car in order not to want someone to scratch it . ”
63452	63466	63467	63467	Belle	485	“ Tell me he did not just say what I think he said . ”
63482	63488	63474	63474	Sam	2667	“ So dramatic , Penrose . ”
63489	63495	63467	63467	Belle	485	“ So chauvinistic , Brennan . ”
63645	63660	63616	63616	Hunter	489	“ Do n’t tell me you did n’t tell your husband you ’re riding . ”
63661	63672	63673	63673	I	3485	“ I did n’t tell my husband I was riding . ”
63699	63708	63686	63686	Hunter	489	“ God - fucking - dammit , Pers . ”
63795	63805	63806	63806	His	489	“ The hell do you think you ’re doing ? ”
63818	63828	63829	63829	I	3485	“ What does it look like I ’m doing ? ”
63841	63846	63829	63829	I	3485	“ Pissing me off . ”
63847	63855	63829	63829	I	3485	“ Thought you were above human emotions . ”
63856	63874	63829	63829	I	3485	“ This one seems to be reoccurring every time you ’re around . You found your calling . ”
63875	63878	63879	63879	I	3485	“ Ha , ”
63882	63898	63879	63879	I	3485	“ so I am good at something . And here you thought I was average . ”
63899	63902	63903	63903	Kill	3067	“ Hunter . ”
63918	63940	63903	63903	Kill	3067	“ We ’re splitting . Lead the group to another trail . I ’ll help Persephone get back to the ranch . ”
63941	63948	63949	63949	I	3485	“ No , you wo n’t , ”
64004	64032	63980	63981	my husband	600	“ Last I checked , it ’s a free country . I ’m allowed to ride a horse , hubs . Whether you like it or not . ”
64033	64062	64063	64063	Kill	3067	“ The country is free , but the horses are not . Hamilton belongs to me , and I do n’t want you riding him . Ceann beag . ”
64072	64080	64063	64063	Kill	3067	“ Beat it before I beat you . ”
64081	64160	64161	64161	Hunter	489	“ Sorry , doll . There ’s a reason he has a demon in his garden fountain and not a cherub or a fawn . You married Satan , and I do n’t want the fucker to assign me a room in hell . He ’ll probably put me in the same cul - de - sac with Hitler and the dude who invented berry - flavored La Croix . I deserve better neighbors . Just following orders . ”
64275	64284	64285	64285	he	489	“ I ’m getting you off this horse , ”
64293	64316	64317	64317	I	3485	“ Why do n’t we start with you just getting me off ? You seem to be having trouble in that department , ”
64321	64349	64285	64285	he	489	“ The first and last time I touched you , you came so hard I was worried my dick would have to be removed from you surgically . ”
64350	64355	64364	64364	me	3485	“ That was accidental . ”
64369	64378	64285	64285	he	489	“ So was my giving you an orgasm . ”
64379	64392	64285	64285	he	489	“ You really want me to hate you , do n’t you ? ”
64420	64426	64427	64427	he	1712	“ Sailor is not riding , ”
64431	64436	64427	64427	he	1712	“ Sailor is pregnant . ”
64437	64450	64451	64451	His	1712	“ As far as we know , you could be , too . ”
64499	64513	64481	64481	He	1712	“ If I am pregnant , it ’s at a very early stage . ”
64514	64523	64481	64481	He	1712	“ All the more reason to be careful . ”
64524	64551	64552	64552	My	3485	“ Oh , for fuck ’s sake , Kill . Do n’t give me this bullshit as though you actually care about my well - being . ”
64587	64592	64576	64576	he	1712	“ Do not curse . ”
64593	64597	64598	64598	My	3485	“ Or else ? ”
64615	64637	64608	64608	My	3485	“ What ’re you gon na do about it ? You ’re already the worst possible husband a woman could have . ”
64678	64727	64728	64728	My	3485	“ By the way , are we going to have sex once a month and pray I get knocked up ? How ’re we going to do this thing ? Please let me know because I ’m starting to realize you have n’t thought your genius plan through ! ”
64760	64765	64728	64728	My	3485	“ … my sister ! ”
64766	64773	64728	64728	My	3485	“ … can hold her own . ”
64774	64785	64728	64728	My	3485	“ I swear to God , if he hurts her … ”
64786	64807	64728	64728	My	3485	“ She ’ll hurt him back . You said it yourself , Belle . She ’s not a kid anymore . ”
64845	64852	64853	64853	Cillian	142	“ You ’re being a brat , ”
64861	64868	64869	64869	My	3485	“ You ’re being a coward . ”
64894	64933	64886	64886	I	3485	“ Seriously , if you ’re going to ignore me for the rest of our lives , just grant me a divorce . I ’ll pay you back the money , and we ’ll forget this ever happened . ”
64934	64937	64938	64938	His	314	“ Never . ”
64945	64967	64938	64938	His	314	“ I ’ll give you a lot of things , Flower Girl , but divorce wo n’t be one of them . ”
64968	64996	64886	64886	I	3485	“ That so ? I ’ll tell Sailor , Belle , and Hunter . I ’m sure they ’d love to know what you roped me into . ”
64997	65001	65002	65002	He	314	“ Go ahead . ”
65018	65039	65002	65002	He	314	“ See how much power other people have on me . You ’ll find the exact amount is absolutely none . ”
65040	65067	65068	65068	His	314	“ So you wo n’t have me , but you wo n’t let me go . Do you just want me to be miserable like you ? ”
65100	65105	65106	65106	I	3485	“ I hate you , ”
65486	65496	65497	65497	I	3485	“ Oh God , oh God , oh God , ”
65689	65692	65693	65693	he	600	“ Fuck , ”
65729	65736	65720	65720	He	600	“ Now , now … uh . ”
65757	65763	65764	65764	he	600	“ You ’re not hurt , ”
65770	65774	65764	65764	he	600	“ I checked . ”
65775	65780	65781	65781	My	3485	“ But you are . ”
65786	65798	65799	65799	He	600	“ I ’ll survive , much to some people ’s dismay . ”
65830	65844	65822	65822	His	600	“ Shhh . It was just a little scare . You ’re fine . ”
65845	65857	65879	65879	he	600	“ That ’s not the point ! You ’re not fine ! ”
65896	65919	65879	65879	he	600	“ I - I do n’t even know what I did wrong . Ash said Hamilton is your best horse for rookies . ”
65967	66039	66040	66040	He	315	“ You did n’t do anything wrong . Hamilton has had a bad couple of years . He had swelling in his rear legs and did n’t get much riding time . When winter hit , he was down for the count . I knew I needed to re - break him come spring . He was n’t ready for riding . When I saw you on him without a helmet … ”
66055	66076	66040	66040	He	315	“ I ’m going to dismember Hunter and feed him to the polar bears he is so desperate to save . ”
66077	66088	66089	66089	I	3485	“ Hunter does n’t like the Arctic drilling , either ? ”
66094	66099	66100	66100	he	315	“ Do n’t start , ”
66103	66117	66118	66118	I	3485	“ Fine . But you should know it was my idea to ride . ”
66158	66183	66138	66138	He	315	“ Hunter screwed this up . He did n’t give Hamilton enough time to get acquainted with you . Smell you . Feel you . ”
66184	66194	66195	66195	My	3485	“ He was by my side the entire time . ”
66208	66222	66195	66195	My	3485	“ It ’s not his fault . It ’s no one ’s fault . ”
66299	66304	66305	66305	I	3485	“ You saved me , ”
66309	66312	66305	66305	I	3485	“ Again . ”
66352	66358	66359	66359	He	772	“ You ’re my wife . ”
66370	66379	66380	66380	I	3485	“ You do n’t act like I am , ”
66383	66391	66380	66380	I	3485	“ We ’re not a normal couple . ”
66392	66395	66396	66396	he	772	“ No , ”
66399	66404	66396	66396	he	772	“ We ’re not . ”
66430	66435	66380	66380	I	3485	“ Where ’s Hamilton ? ”
66436	66471	66472	66472	He	772	“ A question of the ages . I ’ll give you a ride home , then go look for him . You stay with Sailor and try to stay alive while I ’m gone . ”
66547	66553	66554	66554	Sailor	772	“ You look like shit . ”
66559	66569	66570	66570	Kill	3067	“ You are n’t exactly my type , either , ”
66586	66616	66570	66570	Kill	3067	“ Make yourself useful and draw her a bath . Do n’t let her out of your sight . She ’s easy to forget and hard to keep alive . ”
66647	66655	66656	66656	I	3485	“ Nothing about this situation is funny . ”
66673	66676	66677	66677	She	772	“ Oh . ”
66690	66697	66677	66677	She	772	“ But of course it is . ”
66698	66703	66656	66656	I	3485	“ Please enlighten me . ”
66704	66714	66715	66715	Sailor	772	“ You made your husband shit bricks , dude . ”
66731	66785	66715	66715	Sailor	772	“ You should ’ve seen the asshole when I told him you guys went riding . He looked ready to smash some skulls . Someone ’s got it bad for you . Kill and Persy are sitting in a tree . F - U - C - K - I - N - G. ”
66869	66877	66879	66879	Belle	485	“ Cowboy Cunt - sa - nova , ”
66904	66930	66931	66931	Belle	485	“ Let me tell you , I think cowboys are libido repellents , but somehow , watching Kill riding an unruly stallion changed my mind . ”
66944	66957	66939	66939	I	3485	“ Watch it . It ’s my husband you ’re talking about . ”
66970	66997	66958	66958	Ash	120	“ Do n’t worry , Belle is too busy trying to figure out how to drag Devon Whitehall into her bed to think about your husband . ”
67019	67045	67009	67009	I	3485	“ Oh , yeah ? I do n’t think you ’ll need to sweat it . The man was all over you like a rash . ”
67046	67054	67055	67055	Belle	485	“ He ’s such a delicious flirt , ”
67066	67073	67074	67074	I	3485	“ What about you and Sam ? ”
67079	67083	67074	67074	I	3485	“ Any progress ? ”
67084	67104	67105	67105	Ash	120	“ If it ’s not going to happen this year , it ’s not going to happen at all . ”
67114	67119	67109	67109	I	3485	“ I ’m sorry . ”
67163	67177	67178	67178	Hunter	489	“ Anyone else wants to complain about how I invited the girls over ? ”
67207	67219	67220	67220	Devon	177	“ How ’d you learn to cook and bake like that ? ”
67232	67247	67220	67220	Devon	177	“ Our mom is one of the best cooks and bakers in the world . ”
67257	67261	67262	67262	Sam	2667	“ The best , ”
67383	67390	67391	67391	I	3485	“ Thanks , by the way , ”
67432	67436	67404	67404	He	600	“ What for ? ”
67437	67470	67404	67404	He	600	“ Taking care of Byrne . Paying my debt . Getting me a divorce . Saving me from Hamilton ’s wrath . I never said thank you , and I should have . ”
67471	67480	67404	67404	He	600	“ It ’s a part of our agreement . ”
67481	67491	67404	67404	He	600	“ You taking care of me or avoiding me ? ”
67492	67495	67404	67404	He	600	“ Both . ”
67528	67540	67523	67524	my husband	600	“ Mo òrga , are you in or are you out ? ”
67541	67544	67545	67545	Kill	3067	“ In . ”
67565	67570	67561	67561	Hunter	489	“ And the missus ? ”
67571	67576	67577	67577	he	489	“ She ’s out , ”
67583	67587	67588	67588	Belle	485	“ Holy shit . ”
67593	67622	67588	67588	Belle	485	“ Look at the time . It ’s the twenty - first century . That means women can do whatever the hell they like without asking their husbands . ”
67633	67646	67647	67648	My husband	3417	“ You needed the phone to check what century you ’re in ? ”
67655	67669	67647	67648	My husband	3417	“ I think it ’s time to lay off the mimosas , sweetheart . ”
67670	67678	67679	67679	Belle	485	“ My sister is going to play . ”
67690	67702	67647	67648	My husband	3417	“ Wanna bet ? We ’re already in a gambling mood . ”
67735	67743	67647	67648	My husband	3417	“ I swear to God , Kill — ”
67744	67748	67749	67750	My husband	3417	“ Drop it . ”
67758	67778	67749	67750	My husband	3417	“ Her ex lost her entire worldly possessions in poker . Think she wants to relive that , Einstein ? ”
67799	67805	67821	67822	my sister	485	“ Yeah . Thought so . ”
67806	67820	67821	67822	my sister	485	“ If I were her , I ’d play just to spite you , ”
67844	67868	67869	67869	Cillian	142	“ That ’s why you ’re not her . Why she ’s married to a billionaire and you ’re running a strip club , ”
67883	67901	67902	67902	Belle	485	“ Madame Mayhem is a respectable institution . Burlesque is not the same as stripping , assface . ”
67907	67913	67914	67914	Devon	177	“ I do love burlesque , ”
67922	67932	67933	67933	Kill	3067	“ You ’d love genocide if Emmabelle did it , ”
67936	67939	67940	67940	Sam	2667	“ Stakes ? ”
67947	67966	67940	67940	Sam	2667	“ Not that I ’m not entertained by watching you all bickering like a flock of old hens . ”
67967	67972	67973	67973	Kill	3067	“ Same as always , ”
67976	67999	68000	68000	Belle	485	“ Like hell they are . Not everyone at this table can afford throwing a bunch of money on a poker game . ”
68008	68018	68000	68000	Belle	485	“ I ’m not playing for thousands of dollars . ”
68019	68026	68027	68027	Sailor	772	“ We can play for less , ”
68031	68036	68037	68037	Hunter	489	“ Or strip poker . ”
68040	68067	68068	68069	My husband	600	“ Unfortunately for Emmabelle , strip poker would also put her at a point of disadvantage , considering she ’s wearing nothing more than a napkin . ”
68109	68112	68113	68113	I	3485	“ Cillian , ”
68117	68120	68113	68113	I	3485	“ Please . ”
68121	68127	68128	68129	My sister	485	“ You ’re an asshole . ”
68140	68148	68149	68149	Kill	3067	“ And you ’re stating the obvious . ”
68155	68198	68199	68199	Kill	3067	“ How about we make this interesting ? The stakes stay the same as always , seeing as you ’re the only broke person at this table . If you lose , I ’ll foot the bill . And if I win , ”
68218	68227	68210	68210	his	3067	“ I get what I want from you . ”
68309	68320	68321	68321	Emmabelle	3320	“ And what is it that you want from me ? ”
68332	68340	68341	68341	Cillian	142	“ The most precious gift of all , ”
68344	68413	68414	68414	He	142	“ Silence . More specifically , if I win , you will stop treating my wife like a helpless lamb I ’m about to annihilate . I hear and see everything . You ’re not giving my marriage a fair chance . You badmouth me every step of the way . It is disrespectful to Persephone , and it stops today . That applies to you , too . ”
68421	68477	68414	68414	He	142	“ Same stakes . Same terms . Either of you win — you get the money . I win — I pay your debt , and in return , you hop off the Cillian is Satan train . If my wife wants to ride it , she ’ll buy her own ticket and travel solo . ”
68495	68505	68506	68506	Sailor	772	“ Are you saying what you have is real ? ”
68509	68519	68520	68520	he	142	“ I ’m saying what we have is ours , ”
68523	68560	68561	68561	Kill	3067	“ It ’s between Persephone and me . Did n’t hear any objections when Sailor was on babysitting duty to make sure Hunter ’s dick was n’t going on a world tour in their shared apartment . ”
68618	68626	68627	68627	Belle	485	“ I ’m a good poker player . ”
68648	68652	68653	68653	Sailor	772	“ Me too , ”
68659	68666	68633	68633	She	485	“ I ’ll take my chances . ”
68748	68756	68757	68757	His	600	“ So . You want a divorce . ”
68791	68834	68766	68766	He	600	“ If I ’m destined for a life chasing after my husband begging him to get into bed with me , then yes , I want a divorce . You never should ’ve married me if you do n’t find me attractive . ”
68835	68842	68843	68843	He	600	“ I do find you attractive . ”
68856	68866	68843	68843	He	600	“ The problem is I find you too attractive . ”
68867	68872	68873	68873	I	3485	“ I ’m confused , ”
68897	68917	68936	68936	he	600	“ So am I. Every time I look at you . Which is why I ’ve been avoiding you . ”
68918	68923	68924	68924	I	3485	“ I have needs . ”
68929	68935	68936	68936	he	600	“ And I have skills , ”
69019	69025	69026	69026	Sam	2667	“ Your move , Kill . ”
69114	69122	69108	69108	Belle	485	“ He ’s bluffing . I raise . ”
69134	69143	69144	69144	Kill	3067	“ So brazen with other people ’s money . ”
69148	69154	69155	69155	Belle	485	“ I ’m always brazen , ”
69158	69177	69155	69155	Belle	485	“ But when it comes to putting assholes in their place , I ’m also gleeful about it . ”
69178	69182	69183	69183	Sailor	772	“ I fold . ”
69193	69205	69183	69183	Sailor	772	“ Sorry . You know it physically hurts me to lose . ”
69206	69212	69213	69213	Hunter	489	“ Me too , dammit . ”
69245	69275	69243	69243	Cillian	142	“ Is this a who’s - got - the - biggest - cock competition ? Because Emmabelle , my darling , I would be sorely disappointed if you win . ”
69276	69281	69282	69282	Sam	2667	“ But not undeterred , ”
69285	69303	69282	69282	Sam	2667	“ Roll your fucking tongue back into your mouth . You ’re drooling into the tortilla bowl . ”
69381	69387	69388	69388	Emmabelle	3320	“ Show us your cards , ”
69391	69395	69396	69396	he	3320	“ Ask nicely , ”
69400	69420	69421	69421	Hunter	489	“ Goddammit , Kill , read the room . You ’re about a snarky remark away from getting stabbed . ”
69478	69485	69486	69486	Sailor	772	“ Are you okay , Pers ? ”
69491	69506	69507	69507	Belle	485	“ I do n’t know about her , but her husband sure is n’t . ”
69518	69536	69507	69507	Belle	485	“ You ’ve got nothing , American Psycho . I , however , have a full house . ”
69553	69562	69563	69563	I	3485	“ I ’m fine , just … just … ”
69646	69650	69651	69651	Sailor	772	“ You what ? ”
69654	69663	69664	69664	I	3485	“ I pulled a muscle in my foot . ”
69688	69693	69694	69694	Ash	120	“ Oh , shoot . ”
69704	69715	69694	69694	Ash	120	“ Let me have a look , maybe I can … ”
69716	69719	69720	69720	I	3485	“ No ! ”
69760	69769	69741	69741	He	3067	“ I - I’m fine now . Thanks . ”
69783	69788	69789	69789	he	142	“ Beginner ’s luck , ”
69805	69826	69801	69802	my sister	485	“ Do n’t worry , Kill , I ’ll clean out your chips by the end of the next game . ”
69827	69842	69801	69802	my sister	485	“ And my house , if that stripper club gig does n’t pan out . ”
70012	70029	70030	70030	Ash	120	“ My Gosh , Pers , you sure everything ’s okay ? You look in pain , ”
70043	70049	70030	70030	Ash	120	“ Another cramp . Sorry . ”
70104	70115	70116	70116	I	3485	“ I better walk a little , stretch my limbs . ”
70123	70131	70116	70116	I	3485	“ Anyone want anything from the kitchen ? ”
70132	70135	70136	70136	Kill	3067	“ Cognac , ”
70147	70150	70151	70151	Hunter	489	“ Guinness , ”
70154	70157	70158	70158	Sam	2667	“ Cyanide . ”
70163	70177	70158	70158	Sam	2667	“ Make it a double . This game is boring me to death . ”
70178	70192	70193	70193	Hunter	489	“ That ’s because you do n’t enjoy money and always fold early . ”
70196	70203	70193	70193	Hunter	489	“ Why do you do that ? ”
70204	70214	70215	70215	Sam	2667	“ I do n’t play to win or lose , ”
70218	70225	70193	70193	Hunter	489	“ Then why do you play ? ”
70226	70242	70193	70193	Hunter	489	“ To study my opponents , find their weakness , and use it against them . ”
70243	70246	70247	70247	Hunter	489	“ Ah . ”
70250	70261	70247	70247	Hunter	489	“ Remind me to never get on your bad side . ”
70262	70270	70271	70271	Sam	2667	“ You got my baby sister pregnant , ”
70274	70281	70271	70271	Sam	2667	“ A little late for that . ”
70365	70369	70370	70370	Cillian	142	“ Flower Girl , ”
70410	70420	70402	70402	I	3485	“ Show your sister which side you ’re on . ”
70421	70431	70432	70432	I	3485	“ You sure ? It would n’t be yours . ”
70459	70462	70456	70456	Belle	485	“ Ouch . ”
70480	70484	70456	70456	Belle	485	“ All in . ”
70551	70555	70556	70556	Sailor	772	“ Me too . ”
70568	70571	70556	70556	Sailor	772	“ You ? ”
70572	70577	70578	70578	Belle	485	“ Goes without saying . ”
70599	70607	70589	70589	Sailor	772	“ Say hello to my two pairs . ”
70620	70655	70656	70656	She	485	“ That ’s all nice and dandy , but you ’re formally invited to my second full house in a row . Gee , I wonder what I ’ll do with all this money . ”
70666	70695	70656	70656	She	485	“ I ’m thinking a vacation in the Bahamas or maybe get a new car . Whaddaya think , Fitzpatrick ? Will I look good in a Mercedes ? ”
70749	70753	70754	70754	Belle	485	“ Royal flush ! ”
70760	70794	70754	70754	Belle	485	“ There is a one in a half - million chance of getting a royal flush , and you ’re not that damn lucky . You tampered with the cards . Admit it . ”
70879	70898	70899	70899	He	600	“ If you ’re going to throw around accusations , you better back them up with some facts . ”
70904	70913	70914	70914	She	485	“ How the hell would I do that ? ”
70918	70941	70914	70914	She	485	“ Fine . Whatever . Just so we ’re clear , I think you ’re the most corrupted man on the planet . ”
70942	70949	70950	70950	he	600	“ Just so we ’re clear , ”
70964	71044	70950	70950	he	600	“ I do n’t care . Keep the change . And to your question of what to do with said money , I suggest you buy some common sense . In the meantime , I remind you that you ’ve agreed not to interfere with my marriage . No brainwashing my wife or giving her a piece of your mind about me . She ’s a big girl and can make her own decisions . Same goes to you . ”
71093	71098	71099	71099	Aisling	106	“ What just happened ? ”
71104	71108	71109	71109	Belle	485	“ I think , ”
71120	71135	71109	71109	Belle	485	“ Pers just managed to put the first chip in Satan ’s icicle heart . ”
71136	71142	71143	71143	Sailor	772	“ And it hurt him . ”
71146	71151	71143	71143	Sailor	772	“ Like a bitch . ”
71970	71977	71978	71978	Persephone	3162	“ Power - napping , huh ? ”
71986	72006	71978	71978	Persephone	3162	“ I read somewhere that catnaps are more effective than eight hours of sleep . Did you know that ? ”
72053	72057	72038	72038	I	3485	“ Nice number . ”
72058	72067	72068	72068	She	127	“ Is that a compliment I ’m hearing ? ”
72084	72090	72068	72068	She	127	“ Nope . No fever . ”
72091	72099	72100	72100	I	3485	“ Your beauty was never in question , ”
72103	72109	72068	72068	She	127	“ What is , then ? ”
72110	72117	72068	72068	She	127	“ Its ability to disarm me . ”
72184	72194	72178	72178	She	127	“ This is for you , by the way . ”
72195	72202	72203	72203	I	3485	“ What am I looking at ? ”
72214	72238	72178	72178	She	127	“ I saw this on a TV show . Billions . It ’s a contract in which you sell your soul to me . ”
72326	72330	72331	72331	She	127	“ Sign it . ”
72362	72368	72369	72369	She	127	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
72372	72406	72369	72369	She	127	“ You already told me I can never have your heart and mentioned you do n’t believe in souls . That means selling yours to me should n’t be too hard , right ? ”
72477	72491	72492	72492	She	127	“ It ’s okay if you do n’t want to take any chances . ”
72506	72516	72517	72517	I	3485	“ There ’s no such thing as a soul , ”
72521	72533	72517	72517	I	3485	“ In that case , I ’d like to buy yours . ”
72534	72544	72545	72545	I	3485	“ How ’d it end on that TV show ? ”
72556	72559	72560	72560	She	127	“ Billions ? ”
72563	72598	72560	72560	She	127	“ The girl — who has a similar set of beliefs and views on the world as you — signed the contract , proving she truly did n’t believe in her soul ’s existence . ”
72599	72603	72604	72604	I	3485	“ Amateur mistake . ”
72631	72682	72620	72621	my wife	772	“ First rule in business is supply and demand . You put a price on something in accordance to how other people value it . My set of beliefs is irrelevant . You think souls exist , and therefore I will sign mine over to you for the highest price . ”
72683	72690	72620	72621	my wife	772	“ What would that price be ? ”
72691	72699	72700	72700	I	3485	“ Your full submission to our arrangement . ”
72717	72733	72700	72700	I	3485	“ More on that when I figure out what that exactly entails . Subject closed . ”
72850	72891	72836	72836	She	772	“ I ’m glad we ’re going to this charity event . We have n’t gone out as a couple since we got married . Paxton and I used to have date nights all the time . I miss that . ”
72892	72899	72836	72836	She	772	“ Where did Paxton take you ? ”
72942	72996	72929	72929	She	772	“ We had an annual Disney pass . I love a good fairy tale . We used to go to restaurants , dance clubs , football games . Oh , and have picnics , sometimes . Our dream honeymoon was to go to Namibia , but we were too broke to do it . ”
72997	73001	72929	72929	She	772	“ Why Namibia ? ”
73008	73062	72929	72929	She	772	“ I once saw a picture of the Namibian desert in a journal . The yellow dunes looked like velvet . I became obsessed with lying on one of those perfect dunes and looking up at the sun . It looked like the height of being alive . So poignant . So pure . ”
73093	73100	73066	73066	She	772	“ We had a good run . ”
73137	73163	73164	73164	I	3485	“ A man named Andrew Arrowsmith is going to be at the charity ball . He ’s the one filing a lawsuit against Royal Pipelines . ”
73169	73184	73131	73135	a horny tenth grader publicly	1837	“ I know him from TV . He does morning shows and environmental panels . ”
73185	73209	73131	73135	a horny tenth grader publicly	1837	“ I expect you to be on your best behavior . He ’ll examine us closely , look for cracks in the façade . ”
73217	73234	73210	73210	She	772	“ Why do I get the feeling there ’s more to this story than a lawsuit ? ”
73235	73261	73131	73135	a horny tenth grader publicly	1837	“ We go back . We grew up together , went to the same schools for a while . His late father worked for mine . ”
73262	73278	73210	73210	She	772	“ I ’m guessing his departure did n’t include any employee of the year awards . ”
73279	73310	73131	73135	a horny tenth grader publicly	1837	“ Athair made him do the walk of shame and blacklisted him from working at any reputable company on the East Coast . Arrowsmith Senior had a knack for embezzling . ”
73316	73323	73311	73311	Persephone	3162	“ So this lawsuit is personal ? ”
73331	73337	73324	73324	I	3485	“ Arrowsmith Senior died recently . ”
73338	73354	73355	73355	She	772	“ Which opened the old wound , making Andrew take the job at Green Living . ”
73381	73393	73394	73394	She	3223	“ How come the media has n’t picked up on it ? ”
73410	73425	73402	73402	I	3485	“ His hidden agenda , I mean . He ’s a highly public figure . ”
73426	73434	73394	73394	She	3223	“ I have n’t leaked it yet . ”
73435	73438	73402	73402	I	3485	“ Why ? ”
73439	73467	73394	73394	She	3223	“ Arrowsmith ’s got something on me , too . We ’re hanging our sins over each other ’s head , waiting to see who blinks first . ”
73468	73478	73402	73402	I	3485	“ Let ’s make him flinch then , hubs . ”
73479	73503	73394	73394	She	3223	“ There is n’t a we in this operation . You worry about giving me heirs , and I ’ll worry about Arrowsmith . ”
73536	73551	73552	73552	She	3223	“ I mean it , Flower Girl . Do n’t butt into my business . ”
73557	73564	73565	73565	I	3485	“ What are you looking at ? ”
73568	73590	73552	73552	She	3223	“ You held my hand in yours the entire length of the drive . Since you took the contract from me . ”
73601	73606	73565	73565	I	3485	“ Have n’t noticed . ”
73607	73614	73552	73552	She	3223	“ You ’re handsome when flustered . ”
73615	73641	73565	73565	I	3485	“ I swear , Persephone , I ’m going to relocate you to your precious Namibia if you do n’t stop grating on my nerves . ”
73642	73650	73651	73651	Her	3223	“ So now I annoy you constantly . ”
73656	73671	73651	73651	Her	3223	“ That ’s one , steady emotion . Twenty - six more to go ! ”
74062	74067	74038	74038	She	3162	“ What in the — ”
74068	74073	74074	74075	my wife	772	“ Let him go ! ”
74122	74129	74130	74130	She	3162	“ Are you okay , sweets ? ”
74215	74220	74221	74222	My wife	772	“ Are you lost ? ”
74246	74253	74235	74236	The boy	1299	“ Y - y - yes . ”
74254	74262	74235	74236	The boy	1299	“ Let ’s go find your parents . ”
74354	74361	74362	74362	She	772	“ Easy there , little ones . ”
74365	74379	74380	74382	the second boy	1869	“ I ’m not little . I ’m a big boy . Tinder ! ”
74385	74394	74380	74382	the second boy	1869	“ Mommy and Daddy are looking for you . ”
74395	74409	74410	74410	He	1869	“ T - Tree . Look what I found . A real princess . ”
74425	74446	74416	74416	Tinder	196	“ Fitzpatrick . Fancy seeing you here . What are you doing raising funds for For the Love of Cow ? ”
74563	74573	74574	74574	Andrew	157	“ Do n’t tell me you grew a conscience . ”
74590	74594	74595	74595	I	3485	“ What conscience ? ”
74599	74612	74595	74595	I	3485	“ I heard the word cow and figured there ’d be steak . ”
74613	74620	74621	74621	Andrew	157	“ That sounds more like you . ”
74648	74653	74635	74635	ahh	1873	“ She is lovely . ”
74654	74659	74635	74635	ahh	1873	“ I have eyes . ”
74660	74671	74635	74635	ahh	1873	“ Are n’t you going to introduce us to her ? ”
74672	74675	74676	74676	I	3485	“ No , ”
74718	74730	74697	74697	She	3162	“ Persephone Fitzpatrick . It ’s a pleasure to meet you . ”
74731	74756	74767	74767	Persephone	3162	“ Andrew Arrowsmith , and this is my wife , Joelle . I believe you ’ve already met my sons , Tinder and Tree . ”
74757	74766	74767	74767	Persephone	3162	“ Oh , they made a grand entrance . ”
74785	74809	74810	74810	Tinder	196	“ I - I - I - I’m b - b - bored . C - Can you play with me , princess ? ”
74860	74868	74869	74869	She	772	“ This place is boring , huh ? ”
74875	74887	74869	74869	She	772	“ Let ’s see what trouble we can find around here . ”
74888	74903	74904	74904	Joelle	3223	“ No , thank you . We still have a few people to greet . ”
74946	74975	74938	74939	Flower Girl	3223	“ I think Tinder needs the fresh air . We ’ll stay on the balcony , where you can see us . You ’re welcome to join us . ”
74976	74979	74980	74980	I	3485	“ Sweetheart . ”
74990	75004	74980	74980	I	3485	“ You ’re off - duty . Let his parents deal with him . ”
75012	75019	75005	75005	She	772	“ Not everything is a chore . ”
75076	75081	75082	75082	Tinder	196	“ Please , Mommy . ”
75088	75101	75082	75082	Tinder	196	“ Please , we really want to have fun for a change . ”
75102	75105	75106	75106	Joelle	3223	“ Fiiiiine . ”
75110	75118	75106	75106	Joelle	3223	“ Tree and I will tag along . ”
75119	75130	75131	75131	Tree	193	“ You never let us play during stuff like this . ”
75139	75143	75131	75131	Tree	193	“ Why now ? ”
75152	75160	75144	75144	Joelle	3223	“ Of course I do , honey . ”
75200	75206	75207	75207	He	157	“ She really is something . ”
75225	75234	75235	75235	I	3485	“ Something you better avert your eyes from , ”
75238	75253	75235	75235	I	3485	“ Unless you do n’t mind my scooping them out with a dessert spoon . ”
75254	75279	75280	75280	He	157	“ Do n’t pretend you are capable of forming an attachment to anyone or anything other than money , including this delectable little creature . ”
75289	75294	75280	75280	He	157	“ Does she know ? ”
75311	75314	75315	75315	I	3485	“ Yes , ”
75321	75343	75318	75318	He	157	“ Nice try . She does n’t , but she will . And once she does , she ’ll dump you . ”
75344	75351	75352	75352	I	3485	“ Tinder ’s an interesting kid , ”
75356	75359	75360	75360	Andrew	157	“ Yeah . ”
75409	75421	75398	75398	Joelle	3223	“ I give him all the support and help he needs . ”
75422	75434	75435	75435	I	3485	“ Your love and support ca n’t fix his nervous system . ”
75445	75486	75487	75487	He	196	“ I ’m having a real good time fucking up your business , putting billboards next to your office , arranging demonstrations , suing your company for all it ’s worth . What do you have to say about that ? ”
75499	75517	75487	75487	He	196	“ Oh . That ’s right . You never curse . How is that working for you ? ”
75554	75612	75614	75614	my	3485	“ Let ’s cut to the chase , Andrew . Drop the lawsuit , or I will make you lose your job , then your home , then your reputation , exactly in that order . The Arrowsmith fingerprints are all over Royal Pipelines from decades ago . All it takes is one dig inside the company ’s records”—I
75615	75638	75639	75639	I	3485	fingers—“and everything you ’ve built will crumble like a stale cookie . The apple does n’t fall too far from the tree , ”
75643	75693	75614	75614	my	3485	“ My father left you penniless and forced you to scale back on your dream and potential , and if you push me to it , I will make sure your kids wo n’t be able to afford the clothes on their backs and the bread in their stomachs . ”
75705	75721	75694	75694	Andrew	157	“ Do n’t forget I have something on you , too , buddy - boy . ”
75722	75730	75731	75731	I	3485	“ A condition , not a scandal , ”
75734	75834	75694	75694	Andrew	157	“ Condition or not , I bet your father still does n’t know his golden boy is anything but precious metal . Does n’t know the extent of embarrassment you ’ve caused the Fitzpatrick name . You touch Green Living , and I will make sure everyone in the world knows your story . Your history . The ugly lies and uncomfortable truths . It ’s either economic carnage or a private bloodbath , Fitzy . Your pick . But I ’ve a feeling you already came to terms with the fact I ’m going to destroy Royal Pipelines . ”
75859	75869	75875	75875	she	1892	“ Mrs. Fitzpatrick . May I have a dance ? ”
76017	76023	76011	76011	her	3223	“ She ’s a darling . ”
76024	76029	76011	76011	her	3223	“ She will do . ”
76070	76097	76062	76063	Mrs. Arrowsmith	772	“ That ’s not a glowing review for a wife you ca n’t seem to stop staring at . How ’s being a newlywed treating you ? ”
76121	76133	76134	76134	Joelle	3223	“ I thought shotgun marriages were a thing of the past , ”
76160	76175	76138	76138	her	772	“ Everyone is wondering if you two have a little bun in the oven . ”
76227	76240	76224	76224	she	772	“ It is my understanding that this is Persephone ’s second marriage . ”
76241	76249	76250	76250	I	3485	“ Do you enjoy talking to yourself ? ”
76259	76279	76250	76250	I	3485	“ You seem to be holding this one - sided conversation well . A telltale of your marriage dynamic ? ”
76297	76336	76337	76337	She	772	“ I ’m sorry , I did n’t mean to come off as forward . I just think it ’s so brave , what you ’re doing . My husband told me about your condition , and well … ”
76349	76353	76354	76354	I	3485	“ And what ? ”
76362	76398	76291	76291	she	772	“ And it is clear she is still with her ex - husband . I mean , why else would she be visiting her grandmother - in - law at a retirement home every weekend ? ”
76418	76493	76291	76291	she	772	“ I mean , it makes sense . She was penniless with no prospects . And it was high time you got married . The pressure was on , I ’m sure . If you ask me , arranged marriages have their merits . So how does it work , exactly ? Are there three of you in this marriage , or does Mr. Veitch pop in every few weeks for a visit … ? ”
76556	76654	76543	76543	Joelle	3223	“ Please , Cillian , people talk . The minute the country club folks in Back Bay heard about your nuptials , tongues started wagging . Paxton Veitch was my tennis mate ’s student in high school , so she volunteered the information . Apparently , she still visits his grandmother , too . Poor thing has no other relatives in Boston , and she ’s in quite a state . I ’m told your wife has n’t missed a visit in three years , not long after she started dating him . Familia primum , huh ? ”
76689	76695	76696	76696	I	3485	“ Here ’s the thing . ”
76715	76811	76709	76709	she	3223	“ My marriage may be a sham , but at least my wife and I are upfront about it . Your marriage is a farce , and I bet you ’re dumb enough to believe it ’s the real deal . Let me guess — you come from money , do n’t you , Joelle ? Never worked a day in your life . You have a nice , albeit useless bachelor ’s degree from an Ivy League university , a prestigious lineage , and trust funds coming out of every hole in your body ? ”
76840	77019	76829	76829	I	3485	“ Everything Andrew Arrowsmith has done from the moment he was born was to try to make up for the fact he was n’t born into the Fitzpatrick family . He ate from our plates , played in our backyard , and attended the same extracurricular classes I took part in . His family went as far as to send him to the same schools as me . But make no mistakes — the Arrowsmiths never sliced through the airtight seal of Boston ’s upper crust . He is our hang - on , and you , my dear , are his meal ticket . While it is true that I , too , stand in your position of feeding an ambitious , good - looking go - getter of the world , at least I married a woman I ’d like to take to bed every night . You married a social climber who would n’t touch you with a ten - foot pole given the chance . When was the last time he ate you out ? ”
77038	77070	77030	77030	Her	1906	“ Ravaged you like you were a precious prize and not a check he needed to deposit ? Your husband is cheating on you , is n’t he , Mrs. Arrowsmith ? ”
77103	77149	77080	77080	I	3485	“ That ’s what I thought . Tell anyone about my wife visiting her former grandmother - in - law , and I will make sure everyone in America knows your husband has side pieces . Enjoy the rest of your evening , Mrs. Arrowsmith . ”
77150	77172	77173	77173	I	3485	“ Mrs. Fitzpatrick will be spending the night at my place . There ’s no need to stop at her apartment , ”
77290	77299	77300	77300	She	3223	“ I see I ’m growing on you . ”
77322	77329	77330	77330	I	3485	“ You might be needing glasses . ”
77340	77353	77354	77354	She	3223	“ How can you be so unhappy when everything went smoothly tonight ? ”
77359	77369	77354	77354	She	3223	“ Are you programmed to be miserable or something ? ”
77507	77513	77514	77514	I	3485	“ Out of my way . ”
77629	77638	77610	77610	She	772	“ I found a price for my soul . ”
77639	77645	77646	77646	She	772	“ Let ’s hear it . ”
77654	77676	77610	77610	She	772	“ Stop visiting your ex - husband ’s grandmother . It is inappropriate , ungrateful , and sends the wrong message . ”
77699	77702	77703	77703	she	772	“ No , ”
77710	77750	77703	77703	she	772	“ She has no one . She is senile , and lonely , and in desperate need of companionship . She does n’t have much longer to live . I ’m not going to turn my back on her . ”
77840	77848	77825	77825	she	1206	“ She ’s not your responsibility anymore . ”
77874	77888	77889	77889	She	1206	“ I ’m not buying your soul for the price of tarnishing mine . ”
77894	77908	77889	77889	She	1206	“ Sorry , hubs , you ’ll have to think of something else . ”
77909	77918	77924	77925	this woman	1206	“ I ’ll hire a nurse for her . ”
77929	77932	77933	77933	she	1206	“ No , ”
77937	77941	77942	77942	I	3485	“ Two nurses , ”
77951	77957	77958	77958	I	3485	“ The woman is senile . ”
77963	77978	77958	77958	I	3485	“ She is not going to know the difference between you and a professional . ”
77979	77984	77985	77985	She	1206	“ But I will . ”
78001	78021	77985	77985	She	1206	“ And I ’ll know I turned my back on someone helpless just because of my husband ’s whim . ”
78083	78086	78087	78087	she	1206	“ Cillian , ”
78090	78182	78087	78087	she	1206	“ Listen to me . The two most important decisions in our lives are not ours to make . Our creation and our death . We do n’t choose to be born , and we do n’t choose when or how we die . But everything in - between ? That ’s our jurisdiction . We can fill in the blanks as we please . And I choose to fill mine by doing the right thing . By being a good friend — a good human — according to my standards . ”
78276	78280	78281	78281	She	772	“ Come here . ”
78321	78328	78329	78329	My	3485	“ Seen your Aunt Tilda recently ? ”
78388	78401	78402	78402	She	772	“ Yeah , I did , in fact , the other day … ”
78431	78442	78419	78419	I	3485	“ Uhm , which , I guess , was Tuesday ? ”
78624	78631	78632	78632	she	772	“ Oh my God , Kill , ”
78746	78751	78752	78752	She	772	“ Give me everything . ”
78768	78783	78752	78752	She	772	“ Every inch of you . I want everything you give them and more . ”
78953	78963	78937	78937	I	3485	“ Do I still kiss like a hungry Rottweiler ? ”
78988	78998	78979	78979	She	772	“ You ’re improving . This one was better . ”
78999	79006	79007	79007	I	3485	“ Better , but not perfect ? ”
79026	79037	79014	79014	She	772	“ Sadly , we still have to practice . Often . ”
79072	79098	79099	79099	She	772	“ Now show me why you put a continent between you and your mistresses . What could you do to them that is so kinky ? ”
79231	79237	79238	79238	Her	772	“ Is this your jam ? ”
79257	79267	79251	79251	her	772	“ You did it the day … that time … ”
79274	79277	79278	79278	She	772	“ Or … ”
79304	79335	79299	79299	I	3485	“ Maybe this ? I do n’t mind doing things to you , either . I do n’t mind anything , Cillian . As long as it ’s with me . ”
79394	79401	79402	79402	I	3485	“ I do n’t fuck fair , ”
79505	79512	79513	79513	she	772	“ Show me your true colors , ”
79522	79527	79528	79528	I	3485	“ They ’re ugly , ”
79537	79550	79532	79532	She	772	“ Not to me . You ’ll never be ugly to me . ”
79583	79591	79592	79592	She	772	“ Do I need a safe word ? ”
79598	79618	79592	79592	She	772	“ Your mouth will be too occupied for talking . Tap any surface twice , and I ’ll stop . ”
79964	79968	79969	79969	My	3485	“ Tap twice . ”
80181	80189	80190	80190	I	3485	“ Play with your tits for him , ”
80193	80200	80190	80190	I	3485	“ Make it worth his while . ”
80308	80313	80314	80314	I	3485	“ That ’s it , ”
80332	80361	80314	80314	I	3485	“ Open your thighs and smear your juices on my window to show your new neighbor what your husband does to you , my sweet , beautiful slut . ”
80579	80587	80573	80573	She	3223	“ Holy shit , I ’m coming . ”
80713	80724	80725	80725	Persephone	3162	“ God . I ca n’t believe he saw us . ”
80745	80753	80735	80735	her	772	“ I ’m never leaving this house . ”
80754	80763	80764	80764	I	3485	“ Yes , you are , and soon , ”
80778	80783	80735	80735	her	772	“ I ’m mortified . ”
80784	80789	80764	80764	I	3485	“ Do n’t be . ”
80790	80793	80794	80794	She	772	“ Why ? ”
80827	80836	80837	80837	I	3485	“ The window is tinted from the outside , ”
80925	80931	80916	80916	She	772	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
80932	80944	80945	80945	I	3485	“ I do n’t have a sense of humor , remember ? ”
80964	80973	80974	80974	She	772	“ What was he looking at , then ? ”
80988	81005	80974	80974	She	772	“ The flowerbeds on my balcony . My landscaper grows superior roses . Drives him mad . ”
81006	81014	80974	80974	She	772	“ Why did n’t you say so ? ”
81015	81023	81024	81024	I	3485	“ Watching you squirm turned me on . ”
81053	81057	81034	81034	she	772	“ Excuse me ? ”
81058	81075	81076	81076	I	3485	“ Gladly . You are excused . Have been for the six minutes since we finished . ”
81132	81140	81141	81141	I	3485	“ Petar’ll call the driver for you . ”
81173	81179	81141	81141	I	3485	“ Screw you , Kill . ”
81180	81219	81166	81167	Manolo Blahniks	362	“ Sounds like a plan . How about tomorrow ? I have an opening at lunch . If that does n’t work , you ’ll have to wait until I ’m back from work at around nine thirty . ”
81254	81265	81232	81232	She	772	“ I ’m the same as you , you know . ”
81266	81271	81272	81272	I	3485	“ Highly doubt it . ”
81314	81324	81363	81363	she	772	“ I like to see you squirm , too . ”
81331	81342	81363	81363	she	772	“ That ’s adorable . Aim high , Flower Girl . ”
81343	81362	81363	81363	she	772	“ That ’s why , when I danced with Andrew Arrowsmith tonight , I agreed to his proposal , ”
81378	81382	81363	81363	she	772	“ What proposal ? ”
81383	81389	81390	81390	She	772	“ Oh , lookie here . ”
81394	81401	81390	81390	She	772	“ Now I have your attention . ”
81402	81406	81407	81407	I	3485	“ What proposal ? ”
81414	81420	81407	81407	I	3485	“ To tutor his children . ”
81490	81516	81485	81485	She	772	“ Save it , hubs . You have your conditions , and I have mine . One of them was I wanted to keep working . ”
81517	81550	81485	81485	She	772	“ As a pre - K teacher , not my archenemy ’s au pair . This goes against the non - compete contract , which , by the way , you signed . ”
81551	81564	81485	81485	She	772	“ You ca n’t tell me what to do with my career . ”
81595	81600	81601	81601	I	3485	“ I just did . ”
81612	81640	81601	81601	I	3485	“ And I ’m saying it again , for the brain cells in the back : you ’re not working for Andrew Arrowsmith . See ? Easy . ”
81652	81665	81641	81641	She	772	“ In that case , you ’re not drilling in the Arctic . ”
81684	81702	81641	81641	She	772	“ Sorry , sweetheart , your job is riding my cock , not giving me business advice . ”
81706	81730	81703	81703	She	772	“ Then yours is knocking me up , not telling me who I can visit during my weekends and who to work with . ”
81731	81740	81741	81741	I	3485	“ This is a violation of our contract , ”
81757	81762	81703	81703	She	772	“ Leave me then . ”
81763	81772	81773	81773	I	3485	“ You know divorce is not an option , ”
81780	81795	81777	81777	She	772	“ It does take the sting out of the contract , does n’t it ? ”
81805	81822	81800	81800	She	772	“ I ’m going to make your life very miserable if you defy me , Persephone . ”
81836	81847	81830	81830	she	772	“ Been there , done that . Night , hubs ! ”
82168	82171	82152	82152	I	3485	“ Surprise ! ”
82219	82226	82227	82227	I	3485	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
82242	82267	82270	82270	her	485	“ Well , Madame Mayhem does n’t open until this evening , and staring at the wall at home got old about , let ’s see”—my
82273	82280	82281	82281	She	485	watch—“two and a half hours ago . ”
82310	82361	82362	82362	Aisling	106	“ And I had a break in - between classes , so I thought I ’d check in on you . You missed our weekly hangout last week , and I got worried . I love my brother , but I also would n’t trust him with a plastic spoon . ”
82468	82476	82477	82477	Belle	485	“ So how ’s life with Lucifer ? ”
82767	82785	82764	82764	I	3485	“ It ’s okay , I guess . Every couple has its ups and downs , right ? ”
82835	82848	82849	82849	Belle	485	“ Does he know you still see Pax ’s grandmother every week ? ”
82852	82858	82859	82859	I	3485	“ He found out yesterday . ”
82868	82871	82872	82873	My sister	485	“ Snap . ”
82876	82884	82872	82873	My sister	485	“ How did you break the news ? ”
82885	82894	82872	82873	My sister	485	“ I did n’t . Someone else did . ”
82895	82898	82899	82899	Ash	120	“ Who ? ”
82932	82953	82929	82929	I	3485	“ Not really sure . But it ’s out in the open now . He demanded I stop visiting her . ”
82954	82973	82974	82974	Belle	485	“ Bastard has no right to demand you flush the toilet after taking a dump at his place . ”
82996	83019	82981	82981	her	485	“ Your marriage came with a hefty price tag , and every feminist bone in your body ai n’t one of them . ”
83020	83025	83026	83026	I	3485	“ I refused him , ”
83037	83043	83030	83030	Ash	120	“ At least you tried . ”
83044	83048	83049	83049	I	3485	“ And succeeded . ”
83059	83064	83049	83049	I	3485	“ He backed off . ”
83065	83068	83070	83070	Belle	485	“ What ? ”
83075	83080	83081	83081	Aisling	106	“ Are you sure ? ”
83094	83127	83081	83081	Aisling	106	“ I ’ve known Kill since the day I was born and can count his losses on one hand . One finger , actually . Maybe half a finger . A pinky . ”
83128	83131	83132	83132	I	3485	“ Positive , ”
83145	83156	83132	83132	I	3485	“ Can I ask you a few questions , Ash ? ”
83157	83162	83081	83081	Aisling	106	“ Goes without saying . ”
83163	83174	83132	83132	I	3485	“ Does Cillian have a demon fountain in his garden ? ”
83257	83261	83262	83262	she	2006	“ He does , ”
83265	83272	83262	83262	she	2006	“ At least , he did . ”
83310	83316	83317	83317	I	3485	“ Thanks . Next question . ”
83322	83360	83317	83317	I	3485	“ Do you know what his beef with Andrew Arrowsmith is about ? There seems to be buckets of bad blood between them , but your older brother is n’t the most forthcoming man of our generation . ”
83361	83375	83376	83376	Belle	485	“ Criminal understatement . You could extract more information from a garlic press . ”
83387	83391	83376	83376	Belle	485	“ Hashtag fact . ”
83392	83398	83399	83399	Aisling	106	“ I know of Arrowsmith . ”
83406	83771	83399	83399	Aisling	106	“ There ’s an age gap between Cillian and me . I was still in diapers when he and Arrowsmith were friends , but from my understanding , they were inseparable at a point . The way the story goes — mind you , I picked scraps and pieces of it from different sources and puzzled it all together in my head — Kill and Andrew were best friends from birth . They were born on the same day , at the same Boston hospital , both a little underweight . My father had met Andrew ’s father while both of them were watching their newborn sons through a glass window . Shortly after , Athair had hired Andrew ’s dad as an accountant for Royal Pipelines . Cillian and Andrew did everything together , and when it was time for Kill to go to Evon as per our family tradition , Athair footed half the bill and sent Andrew along with him . Kill and Andy were like brothers . Spending their summer vacations together . Riding together , having sleepovers , planning world domination side by side . Until Athair fired Andrew ’s dad and sued him for all the money he ’d stolen from Royal Pipelines , leaving the Arrowsmith family penniless and struggling to make ends meet . Athair cut off the cash flow to Andrew ’s education , punishing the son for his father ’s sins . Andrew ’s dad refused to admit defeat and pull his son out of Evon the first year . He wanted to save face . The family resorted to begging their relatives for loans . Some say Andrew ’s mother , Judy , became some rich guy ’s plaything to keep their heads above water . Andrew ’s parents divorced not long after . He dropped out of Evon the following year and moved into a tiny apartment in Southie with his mother and sister . Their lives fell apart , and so did the close friendship between Andy and Kill . The families drew an invisible line in Boston , splitting it down the middle , avoiding one another at all costs . ”
83823	83837	83838	83838	I	3485	“ Did Andrew try to retaliate for your father ’s decision through Kill ? ”
83860	83921	83922	83922	Ash	120	“ Mom said the one year Andrew and Cillian spent in Evon together almost cost her a son . My older brother lost a lot of weight , quit playing polo , and withdrew completely from the world . My brother has always been cold and different , but after that year , everyone agreed he ’d become , well … ”
83940	83943	83922	83922	Ash	120	“ Soulless . ”
84025	84035	84036	84036	I	3485	“ Thanks for sharing this with me , Ash . ”
84050	84077	84043	84043	She	2008	“ That ’s what sisters - in - law are for , right ? Just please do n’t tell Kill . He ’ll never forgive me . ”
84078	84086	84087	84087	Belle	485	“ Your secret ’s safe with us , ”
84969	84980	84981	84981	I	3485	“ Petar , can you show me the demon fountain ? ”
84999	85010	84991	84991	He	172	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick would n’t want me to . No . ”
85049	85059	85060	85060	Petar	142	“ Anything you need , just let us know . ”
85072	85106	85060	85060	Petar	142	“ Seriously . A home - cooked meal , extra pillows … the name of a good shrink . I ’m at your service , Persephone . On call twenty - four seven . ”
85117	85127	85109	85109	I	3485	“ Thanks , Petar . You ’re a star . ”
85162	85168	85169	85169	Petar	142	“ May I say something ? ”
85184	85188	85175	85175	I	3485	“ Of course . ”
85189	85252	85169	85169	Petar	142	“ I ca n’t tell you how happy everyone in this place is to have you here . I ’m not sure how exactly you managed to persuade Mr. Fitzpatrick into moving in — I’ve never seen a woman who was n’t an employee , his sister , or his mother set foot in this house — but I ’m glad nonetheless . ”
85352	85359	85360	85360	I	3485	“ I intend to stick around . ”
85366	85372	85373	85373	Petar	142	“ I hope you will . ”
85376	85395	85373	85373	Petar	142	“ And if there ’s anything I can do to make you stay , please let me know . ”
85601	85608	85609	85609	he	142	“ That ’s not your bed , ”
85612	85631	85609	85609	he	142	“ If I ’m good enough to warm it , I ’m good enough to sleep in it . ”
85647	85675	85609	85609	he	142	“ No one said you ’re good enough to warm it . I took you on the kitchen counter and against the window , not my bed . ”
85676	85687	85688	85688	I	3485	“ Keeping track and cherishing every moment , I see . ”
85693	85699	85609	85609	he	142	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
85700	85717	85718	85718	I	3485	“ Aww , but you started it , hubs . What ’s the time , anyway ? ”
85731	85735	85609	85609	he	142	“ Nine thirty . ”
85743	85751	85736	85737	Jesus Christ	281	“ Do you always work this late ? ”
85769	85812	85752	85752	He	281	“ My social calendar is — by choice — wide open . As your legs should be every night when I come back home , by the way . It is not my job to undress you to candlelight and Frank Sinatra . ”
85813	85821	85752	85752	He	281	“ I prefer Sam Cooke and incense . ”
85822	85831	85752	85752	He	281	“ I do n’t care what you prefer . ”
85832	85836	85837	85837	I	3485	“ Rectify that , ”
85841	85944	85837	85837	I	3485	“ Today . Or live a life of celibacy . I ’m not your blowup doll . If you want me to fulfill my marital duties , you better believe you are going to fulfill yours . You will never , ever touch my things without my permission again , move me around like I ’m a chess piece , or make a decision about our lives without consulting me first . Additionally , you will be home every evening not a minute after seven , so we can have a meal together before we have sex . Like a normal couple . ”
85945	86003	86004	86004	He	2057	“ What part of our relationship gave you the illusion of a normal couple , the fact I bought your ass like you were a discounted bread maker on Black Friday , or had you sign a thirty - seven - page contract , an NDA , and a waiver before putting a ring on your finger ? ”
86090	86093	86094	86094	I	3485	“ Furthermore , ”
86105	86119	86094	86094	I	3485	“ during dinner , we ’ll perform the taxing task of small talk . ”
86142	86169	86137	86137	I	3485	“ You ’ll tell me about your day , and I ’ll do the same . Then , and only then , will we make love . ”
86187	86193	86253	86253	He	600	“ The answer is no . ”
86194	86248	86249	86249	I	3485	“ Fine . Let ’s go through the whole routine where I refuse you a few weeks in a row , and you march back to your bed unsatisfied , then go to the office , see Hunter waving around 3D ultrasound pictures of his future child , then do it my way . ”
86289	86295	86296	86296	He	600	“ Careful , Flower Girl . ”
86317	86327	86296	86296	He	600	“ Run with scissors and you ’ll get hurt . ”
86328	86336	86296	86296	He	600	“ I ’ve been cut deep before . ”
86337	86348	86296	86296	He	600	“ Whatever you ’re trying to do wo n’t work . ”
86349	86355	86296	86296	He	600	“ Humor me , then . ”
86356	86361	86362	86362	He	600	“ Humor me first . ”
86438	86461	86462	86462	He	600	“ I can give you anything your heart desires , Persephone . Jewelry , lavish vacations , every Hermès bag ever produced . ”
86481	86502	86462	86462	He	600	“ But I ca n’t give you love . Do not ask me for something I am incapable of delivering . ”
86523	86536	86518	86518	his	600	“ My heart is a terrible place . Nothing ever grows there . ”
86537	86540	86541	86541	I	3485	“ Stop . ”
86583	86593	86594	86594	he	600	“ Ever step on artificial grass , Flower Girl ? ”
86600	86603	86604	86604	I	3485	“ Yes , ”
86611	86622	86604	86604	I	3485	“ It ’s shinier than regular grass but feels awful . ”
86669	86681	86658	86658	He	600	“ I ’m going to ruin every good thing about you . ”
86682	86691	86658	86658	He	600	“ I ’d like to see you try . ”
86823	86830	86798	86798	Kill	3067	“ Where did you find this ? ”
86831	86836	86798	86798	Kill	3067	“ Your cigar box . ”
86837	86845	86798	86798	Kill	3067	“ You were going through my things . ”
86846	86854	86855	86855	I	3485	“ Your talent at deduction is staggering . ”
86874	86901	86855	86855	I	3485	“ You took my things out of my apartment without consulting me . Consider it me getting even . Why did you keep the fastening band ? ”
86902	86905	86798	86798	Kill	3067	“ Tradition . ”
86906	86909	86910	86910	I	3485	“ Please . ”
86913	86921	86910	86910	I	3485	“ You ’re not the sentimental type . ”
86936	86950	86798	86798	Kill	3067	“ Good point . It ’s not too late to throw it out . ”
86963	86976	86977	86977	I	3485	“ Shame . You were so good at tying us with it , ”
87059	87063	87069	87069	his	3485	“ You noticed . ”
87087	87094	87095	87095	I	3485	“ Why are you doing that ? ”
87100	87104	87105	87105	His	3485	“ Doing what ? ”
87113	87124	87105	87105	His	3485	“ Looking at me like I ’m your next meal . ”
87125	87130	87131	87131	he	3485	“ Because you are , ”
87134	87146	87131	87131	he	3485	“ That ’s why you ’re here , is n’t it ? ”
87270	87286	87287	87287	I	3485	“ So this is how you knew how to tie us both with one hand , ”
87290	87297	87298	87298	He	3485	“ It ’s called a hogtie . ”
87307	87313	87298	87298	He	3485	“ Lift your feet up . ”
87393	87400	87401	87401	I	3485	“ Should ’ve undressed me first , ”
87466	87474	87475	87475	His	142	“ Do you trust me , Persephone ? ”
87492	87495	87475	87475	His	142	“ Yes . ”
87607	87615	87616	87616	He	142	“ Sure about that , Flower Girl ? ”
87640	87646	87647	87647	I	3485	“ I ’m not scared . ”
87679	87682	87683	87683	He	142	“ Why ? ”
87710	87720	87704	87704	Kill	3067	“ Because I know you would never hurt me . ”
87721	87730	87704	87704	Kill	3067	“ That ’s an optimistic assumption to make . ”
87731	87742	87743	87743	I	3485	“ You saved my life three times , and counting , ”
87746	87755	87743	87743	I	3485	“ That ’s optimistic . I ’m realistic . ”
87952	87956	87957	87957	he	600	“ Your ass , ”
87966	87970	87957	87957	he	600	“ It ’s … ”
87987	87992	87993	87993	I	3485	“ Oh , that . ”
87998	88011	87993	87993	I	3485	“ My skin is super sensitive . Welsh heritage , and all . ”
88012	88019	88020	88020	he	600	“ I did that to you , ”
88024	88029	88030	88030	I	3485	“ It ’s nothing , ”
88114	88120	88121	88121	I	3485	“ Do n’t you dare . ”
88128	88157	88121	88121	I	3485	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick , you did not ask for permission to untie me . You will not do so until I explicitly request it . Am I clear ? ”
88169	88180	88181	88181	he	600	“ I do n’t normally see them the morning after , ”
88185	88196	88181	88181	he	600	“ I ’ve never stopped to wonder what it looks — ”
88197	88211	88181	88181	he	600	“ Do n’t tell me about your whores while we ’re in bed ! ”
88258	88273	88248	88248	I	3485	“ Actually , do n’t tell me about them out of it , either . ”
88274	88281	88282	88282	he	600	“ There are no whores anymore , ”
88286	88293	88282	88282	he	600	“ You made sure of that . ”
88294	88297	88298	88298	I	3485	“ Good . ”
88312	88338	88298	88298	I	3485	“ I hope your mistresses go bankrupt now that you are not there to pay them , and get a real job to support themselves . ”
88339	88344	88345	88345	he	600	“ You ’re insane , ”
88355	88393	88298	88298	I	3485	“ Well , lucky for me , hubs , you ’re not charting high on the sanity spectrum , either . Now do what you want to do to me . And make it worth my while . ”
88438	88441	88431	88431	I	3485	“ Yes . ”
88717	88723	88707	88707	Cillian	142	“ Tell me to stop . ”
88724	88728	88729	88729	I	3485	“ Go harder . ”
88780	88787	88788	88788	I	3485	“ You please me , Persephone . ”
89587	89594	89595	89595	I	3485	“ Aunt Flow is in town , ”
89616	89625	89626	89626	Kill	3067	“ Better than Aunt Tilda , I suppose . ”
89635	89643	89644	89644	I	3485	“ Is this supposed to be funny ? ”
89668	89682	89651	89651	He	3067	“ Thanks for letting me know . I ’ll plan my evening accordingly . ”
89683	89687	89688	89688	I	3485	“ Have fun , ”
89701	89706	89651	89651	He	3067	“ I intend to . ”
89811	89817	89818	89818	He	3067	“ Did you call me ? ”
89826	89829	89821	89821	I	3485	“ No . ”
89830	89838	89839	89839	My	3485	“ I thought I heard your voice . ”
89864	89869	89870	89870	He	3067	“ I came for … ”
89887	89899	89870	89870	He	3067	“ I do n’t know what the hell I came for . ”
89900	89906	89907	89907	I	3485	“ Yes , you do , ”
89995	89999	89983	89983	I	3485	“ Say it . ”
90042	90057	90033	90033	He	3067	“ I came here to make out with you middle school style . Happy ? ”
90058	90061	90062	90062	I	3485	“ Very . ”
90169	90182	90183	90183	he	3067	“ I like your hands and mouth where I can see them , ”
90186	90197	90198	90198	I	3485	“ I ’m not a rabid animal from the wilderness . ”
90232	90235	90236	90236	I	3485	“ Sree ? ”
90244	90248	90236	90236	I	3485	“ Nrro teeth . ”
90281	90297	90310	90310	I	3485	“ Fine . But we ’ll do it my way . I ’ve got requirements . ”
90298	90301	90302	90302	I	3485	“ Shocker ! ”
90313	90318	90310	90310	I	3485	“ I ’m listening . ”
90319	90326	90327	90327	He	3067	“ Lick it first . Thoroughly . ”
90375	90378	90379	90379	I	3485	“ Faster . ”
90382	90391	90392	90392	He	3067	“ More tongue . More saliva . More . ”
90447	90450	90451	90451	he	3067	“ Well , ”
90472	90493	90451	90451	he	3067	“ I was going to keep the line between respectful wife and my flings firmly drawn , but I suppose … ”
90523	90542	90543	90543	he	3067	“ I suppose the line has already been crossed . Choke on my cock , you beautiful slut , ”
90599	90611	90612	90612	His	3067	“ Tap my thigh twice if you want me to stop . ”
90724	90729	90730	90730	he	3067	“ That was good , ”
90733	90742	90730	90730	he	3067	“ You get an A+ , Flower Girl . ”
90743	90754	90755	90755	I	3485	“ Then why did n’t you come in my mouth ? ”
90771	90777	90778	90778	He	3067	“ Instinct , I suppose . ”
90784	90812	90813	90813	He	3067	“ Escorts have been known to steal billionaires ’ sperm . My ground rules are I always bring my own condoms and never leave my cum unattended . ”
90828	90843	90813	90813	He	3067	“ Now , how about I return the favor and eat that sweet pussy ? ”
90848	90855	90844	90844	My	3485	“ On my period ? Never . ”
90856	90862	90876	90876	He	3067	“ I do n’t care . ”
90863	90867	90844	90844	My	3485	“ I do . ”
90868	90875	90876	90876	He	3067	“ Fine . Nipples it is . ”
91146	91177	91178	91178	she	1931	“ They fell a bit behind on the material . As you know , there are certain milestones they need to hit by the time they go to first grade , ”
91392	91402	91403	91403	She	3223	“ God , you look fresh as a daisy . ”
91410	91424	91407	91407	I	3485	“ Well , I try to get eight hours of sleep every night . ”
91425	91444	91403	91403	She	3223	“ The twins wake up several times a night to go to the bathroom and ask for water . ”
91445	91453	91454	91454	I	3485	“ You need to sleep train them , ”
91457	91465	91454	91454	I	3485	“ I can help you with that . ”
91560	91570	91571	91571	Joelle	3223	“ Children , please calm down . I apologize . ”
91579	91627	91571	91571	Joelle	3223	“ The nanny is a middle - aged woman from France . See , we really wanted them to be bilingual . But she did n’t know what I meant . My eyes traveled to her designer shirt , which was not only stained , but inside out .
91628	91631	91571	91571	Joelle	3223	“ Very . ”
91632	91685	91571	91571	Joelle	3223	“ Then I suggest you drop the French lessons and hire someone young and fun to do daily activities with them . Take them to swimming lessons or do cartwheels at the park . Teach them how to ride a bike and a scooter . Do things that would build their confidence . ”
91733	91744	91745	91745	Joelle	3223	“ Maybe you can do all those things with them , ”
91802	91817	91818	91818	I	3485	“ I can do three times a week . Do they go to school ? ”
91821	91869	91792	91792	she	3223	“ Yes , but only until noon . Andrew works nonstop , and I am on the panel of three different charities and on the county board of supervisors . Not to mention , Andrew just signed another book deal . There ’ll be a grand tour … ”
91883	91899	91876	91876	She	3052	“ Do n’t look at me like that . Andrew wants to run for mayor . ”
91900	91904	91792	91792	she	3223	“ I see . ”
91922	91930	91931	91931	she	3052	“ What ’s your rate , anyway ? ”
91935	91942	91943	91943	I	3485	“ Twenty - five per hour , ”
91954	91960	91946	91946	She	3052	“ Really ? So little ? ”
91964	91973	91961	91961	I	3485	“ It ’s not so little for me . ”
92014	92026	92034	92034	her	3052	“ I take it you and your husband have separate accounts . ”
92039	92043	92034	92034	her	3052	“ We do . ”
92109	92131	92132	92132	Joelle	3223	“ All right . Three times a week . Including full Saturdays . I have to catch up on admin work . ”
92144	92161	92132	92132	Joelle	3223	“ Half a Saturday . I visit my former grandmother - in - law on Saturdays . ”
92162	92169	92170	92170	She	3052	“ Oh , that ’s right . ”
92184	92191	92176	92176	she	3052	“ You got yourself a deal . ”
92201	92225	92198	92198	I	3485	“ Guess what ? We ’re going to make letter - shaped cookies today ! I brought all the ingredients . You ready ? ”
92226	92229	92230	92230	Tree	193	“ Yes ! ”
92457	92468	92469	92469	I	3485	“ Do n’t forget to save me all the reds , ”
92474	92481	92469	92469	I	3485	“ Red is my favorite color . ”
92487	92492	92493	92493	Tree	193	“ I love blue . ”
92498	92505	92493	92493	Tree	193	“ Like Sully from Monsters , Inc. ”
92506	92512	92513	92513	Tinder	196	“ And I love pink , ”
92516	92520	92513	92513	Tinder	196	“ Like flamingos . ”
92521	92527	92528	92528	Tree	193	“ Pink is for girls . ”
92533	92540	92528	92528	Tree	193	“ Tinder likes Elsa , too . ”
92562	92566	92567	92567	I	3485	“ So do I. ”
92573	92584	92567	92567	I	3485	“ Is n’t she cool ? She has awesome superpowers . ”
92585	92593	92594	92594	Tree	193	“ Catboy from PJ Masks is cooler , ”
92604	92619	92594	92594	Tree	193	“ He is as fast as lightning and can hear anything . Even ants ! ”
92620	92629	92630	92630	Tinder	196	“ B - But can he freeze someone ? ”
92703	92706	92707	92707	Tree	193	“ Moooooom . ”
92715	92721	92707	92707	Tree	193	“ Tinder ruined his shirt . ”
92722	92739	92740	92740	Joelle	3223	“ Jesus Christ , Tin , again ? You ’re really something , are n’t you . ”
92767	92772	92773	92773	I	3485	“ Please do n’t , ”
92776	92795	92773	92773	I	3485	“ It ’s totally natural . I have a few kids in class who do it , too . ”
92796	92806	92807	92807	she	3223	“ He goes through dozens of shirts a week ! ”
92815	92819	92820	92820	I	3485	“ Let him , ”
92826	92846	92820	92820	I	3485	“ If it ’s his way of coping with stress , making a fuss would only escalate the issue . ”
92871	92875	92876	92876	I	3485	“ Excuse me . ”
92925	92928	92929	92929	I	3485	“ Joelle , ”
92956	92960	92950	92950	I	3485	“ Tinder is — ”
92961	92965	92966	92966	she	2158	“ I know , ”
92976	93009	92966	92966	she	2158	“ His therapist said it is too early for an official diagnosis . We are monitoring him closely , but I feel completely in the dark as to what his condition entails . ”
93010	93017	93018	93018	I	3485	“ Criticizing him wo n’t help . ”
93026	93096	93018	93018	I	3485	“ Every child is different in personality , progress , and needs . French is the very last thing these kids need . Tinder , especially , needs a lot of love , and affection , and attention . He needs to know you love him unconditionally . If you ’re confused , think about what he is going through . He is starting to realize he is different . ”
93131	93183	93097	93097	Her	2158	“ I ’m at a loss . My family produced happy - go - lucky kids . We do n’t have a history of anything outside the norm . Tree reminds me so much of my brothers and me when we were little . Independent and athletic . While Tinder is — ”
93184	93200	93201	93201	I	3485	“ Other great things . And not even a pinch less treasured than his brother , ”
93207	93238	93201	93201	I	3485	“ Different kids require different sets of rules and techniques . You were blessed with two healthy children . That ’s more than so many women dare to dream of . ”
93343	93348	93349	93349	Joelle	3223	“ You ’re right . ”
93354	93402	93349	93349	Joelle	3223	“ You ’re so right . I need to stop this self - pity . Tinder ’s a great kid , you know ? A little behind on the letters and numbers , but he can paint like nobody ’s business . And he is so imaginative ! ”
93428	93460	93406	93406	her	3223	“ Tell you what . I ’m about to read them a few stories while the cookies bake . Why do n’t you stick around ? Spend some time with us ? ”
93461	93470	93471	93471	She	3223	“ You think it ’s a good idea ? ”
93475	93487	93471	93471	She	3223	“ They do n’t seem to like me all that much . ”
93488	93494	93495	93495	I	3485	“ You ’re their mother . ”
93498	93507	93495	93495	I	3485	“ They ’re bound to adore you unconditionally . ”
93508	93529	93530	93530	Joelle	3223	“ I come from a family where parenting is done by others . I ’m not very good with kids , ”
93534	93544	93545	93545	I	3485	“ You ’re better than you think you are , ”
93549	93555	93530	93530	Joelle	3223	“ How do you know ? ”
93556	93562	93530	93530	Joelle	3223	“ Because you made them . ”
94338	94343	94344	94344	she	772	“ My favorite wish , ”
94357	94361	94344	94344	she	772	“ My miracle . ”
94362	94372	94373	94373	Hunter	489	“ Is that a smile on Cillian ’s face ? ”
94441	94448	94449	94449	Devon	177	“ A smile ? Surely not . ”
94462	94470	94449	94449	Devon	177	“ Perhaps he is having a stroke . ”
94471	94480	94481	94481	Hunter	489	“ Maybe something got stuck in his teeth . ”
94489	94499	94481	94481	Hunter	489	“ Like , you know , feelings or something . ”
94500	94504	94505	94505	I	3485	“ Zip it , ”
94508	94519	94520	94520	Sam	2667	“ No . They ’re right . You ’re beaming . ”
94527	94539	94520	94520	Sam	2667	“ It ’s disgusting . People are trying to eat here . ”
94548	94559	94560	94560	Hunter	489	“ Leave him alone . I think it ’s cute . ”
94568	94588	94560	94560	Hunter	489	“ Kill caught a case of the feels , and there ’s no vaccine for what he ’s experiencing . ”
94589	94602	94603	94603	I	3485	“ Are you really one to talk about being pussy - whipped ? ”
94617	94642	94603	94603	I	3485	“ Your balls have been MIA since your wife came into the picture , and no search unit in the world can find them . ”
94653	94656	94657	94657	I	3485	“ What ? ”
94662	94669	94670	94670	Devon	177	“ You said pussy - whipped . ”
94675	94680	94670	94670	Devon	177	“ You never curse . ”
94681	94689	94657	94657	I	3485	“ Pussy is not a curse word . ”
94690	94703	94704	94704	Hunter	489	“ I have a gay joke on the tip of my tongue . ”
94716	94720	94721	94721	I	3485	“ Swallow it , ”
94724	94731	94732	94732	Hunter	489	“ That ’s what he said . ”
94763	94780	94744	94744	He	489	“ Sorry . Had to get it out of my system . I ’m done now . ”
94872	94893	94894	94894	Hunter	489	“ Anyway , point is , you say you ’re immune to feelings , and I call bullshit on it . ”
94897	94905	94906	94906	I	3485	“ I ’m not immune to feelings , ”
94909	94918	94906	94906	I	3485	“ I have two : pleasure and pain . ”
94919	94928	94929	94929	Devon	177	“ Your wife ’s pussy gives you pleasure , ”
94945	94956	94929	94929	Devon	177	“ But when was the last time you felt pain ? ”
94957	94976	94977	94977	Hunter	489	“ Very soon , when Persy finally realizes she married a robot and kicks him to the curb . ”
94990	94994	94977	94977	Hunter	489	“ I fold . ”
94995	94998	94999	94999	Sam	2667	“ Kill , ”
95005	95013	94999	94999	Sam	2667	“ I need a word in private . ”
95014	95022	95023	95023	I	3485	“ Perfect timing . Game ’s over . ”
95028	95035	95036	95036	Devon	177	“ We ’ve only just started . ”
95039	95047	95036	95036	Devon	177	“ I have a good hand going . ”
95048	95065	95066	95066	I	3485	“ Mine ’s about to snap your neck if you do n’t get out of here . ”
95095	95100	95101	95101	I	3485	“ What ’s up ? ”
95108	95115	95101	95101	I	3485	“ It ’s about Andrew Arrowsmith . ”
95264	95277	95278	95278	Sam	2667	“ I did some digging . Spoke to one of his lawyers . ”
95288	95375	95278	95278	Sam	2667	“ One of the angles they ’re going to use in court is defamation . Specifically , the poor state of your marriage . They ’re going to imply your character is flawed through your estranged relationship with Persephone . Basically , they ’re going to heavily suggest you ’re an abusive husband . Your wife is employed by them and receives a salary from them . She visits their house three to four times a week , which I ’m sure you are aware of . ”
95389	95433	95387	95387	Persephone	3162	“ Not only is Persy spending most of her time with the Arrowsmiths , but you do n’t have a family life to speak of . It looks bad . The apartment you ’re still renting for her , your separate bank accounts … ”
95443	95449	95434	95434	I	3485	“ Rewind . Separate accounts ? ”
95476	95495	95450	95450	Persephone	3162	“ Do n’t tell me you were dumb enough to add her to your bank accounts , Kill . ”
95496	95499	95500	95500	I	3485	“ No , ”
95504	95558	95500	95500	I	3485	“ But I deposit a sixty - thousand - dollar monthly allowance into her checking account . Seeing as she lives under my roof , eats my food , and generally lives at my expense , I figured this would be a sufficient amount for her not to look for any side gigs . ”
95559	95580	95613	95613	her	3162	“ Well , that ’s what she told the Arrowsmiths . You did know she works for them , correct ? ”
95663	95666	95667	95667	Sam	2667	“ Cillian ? ”
95688	95692	95693	95693	I	3485	“ I knew , ”
95696	95704	95672	95672	I	3485	“ Why did n’t you stop it ? ”
95705	95733	95672	95672	I	3485	“ Because I do n’t care much what she does in her free time as long as she does n’t nag me to spend time with her . ”
95734	95780	95672	95672	I	3485	“ Well , start caring if you want to win the case against Arrowsmith . Tell your wife to drop their asses , pronto . If there ’s one thing you do n’t need right now , it ’s for Persephone to give Arrowsmith ammo . ”
95781	95790	95791	95791	I	3485	“ How much does her word really weigh ? ”
95794	95802	95791	95791	I	3485	“ She is just a stupid kid . ”
95803	95812	95813	95813	Sam	2667	“ A stupid kid you ’re married to , ”
95817	95821	95813	95813	Sam	2667	“ Dismantle her . ”
95822	95826	95791	95791	I	3485	“ I will . ”
95827	95835	95836	95836	Sam	2667	“ Why do n’t we tail Goldilocks ? ”
95852	95860	95836	95836	Sam	2667	“ See what she ’s up to . ”
95912	95924	95925	95925	I	3485	“ Why would I waste my precious resources on my wife ? ”
95929	95943	95876	95876	she	772	“ Do n’t you want to know if she still visits Mrs. Veitch ? ”
95944	95948	95885	95885	she	772	“ She does . ”
95949	95956	95876	95876	she	772	“ And you do n’t care ? ”
95957	95979	95980	95980	I	3485	“ For all I care , Persephone can go back to her loser ex after she ’s done having my children . ”
95994	96008	96009	96009	he	3485	“ Remind her you will drop her ass if she breaks your agreement , ”
96023	96027	96028	96028	I	3485	“ Anything else ? ”
96036	96039	96040	96040	He	3485	“ Yes . ”
96047	96123	96040	96040	He	3485	“ Get your shit together . I ’ve never seen you lose a poker game unintentionally . These assholes ripped you a new hole today , and it has n’t even been an hour . I ’ve never seen you at home before nine o’clock in the evening before , either . Guess what ? Last week , I dropped by your office at half past six and was told you ’d gone home early . ”
96205	96220	96221	96221	He	2667	“ I said I ’ll talk to her . Know where the door is ? ”
96228	96232	96221	96221	He	2667	“ Of course . ”
96233	96237	96221	96221	He	2667	“ Use it . ”
96397	96411	96412	96412	I	3485	“ You ’re going to stop tutoring the Arrowsmith kids starting tomorrow morning , ”
96454	96458	96440	96440	She	772	“ Excuse me ? ”
96459	96473	96440	96440	She	772	“ I know you ’ve been tutoring them . It stops right now . ”
96474	96481	96482	96482	Her	772	“ Have you been following me ? ”
96509	96540	96482	96482	Her	772	“ Sweetheart , let ’s not pretend I care enough to have you followed . Sam follows Andrew , and he saw you going in and out of his house . ”
96541	96547	96548	96548	She	772	“ Sam ’s an asshole . ”
96575	96664	96482	96482	Her	772	“ What Sam is and is n’t is not my concern . I ’m not married to him . You , however , are currently breaking a contract you signed . The non - compete clause . You went and ran your mouth to my enemy like the little idiot that you are , telling him we have separate accounts . Now Andrew is going to use your employment in court to show that I am an unloving , neglectful husband in order to establish my bad character . ”
96665	96672	96673	96673	She	2218	“ You are an unloving husband . ”
96684	96692	96482	96482	Her	772	“ Love was n’t in the contract . ”
96693	96698	96699	96699	she	2218	“ Screw your contract ! ”
96709	96720	96721	96721	I	3485	“ Why ? Screwing you is so much more enjoyable . ”
96766	96783	96760	96760	I	3485	“ Quit tomorrow morning . I wo n’t ask twice . This is non - negotiable . ”
96784	96788	96789	96789	She	2218	“ Or else ? ”
96795	96831	96789	96789	She	2218	“ What are you going to do if I decide to continue tutoring these kids — Tinder especially , a boy who needs me , who relies on me , who is attached to me ? ”
96913	96928	96929	96929	Divorce	392	“ Disobey , and I will give you what you ’ve been begging for . ”
96950	96954	96955	96955	she	2218	“ Say it , ”
96963	96979	96955	96955	she	2218	“ Tell me what you ’ll do . Tell me I mean nothing to you . ”
97025	97116	97117	97117	My	3485	“ If you continue to ignore our contract , I ’ll have to break my part of the bargain , too . If you still work for the Arrowsmiths by mid - week , I ’m putting Sam on your ass to tail your every movement . Next , I ’m taking a flight to Europe , to fuck every abled body in my vicinity . Then — without taking a shower to wash them off — I’ll come back to put a baby in you , with ovulation tests . ”
97139	97245	97126	97126	I	3485	“ Their smell and juices inside you . To remind you that you are nothing but a plaything to me . The sad part is that we both know you ’d let me , Flower Girl . You ’ve been hot for this dick since the day you saw me . But you ’d hate yourself for it , and every time you would look at our child , you would see what I ’ve done to you . Know your place , Persephone . You are not here to co - rule the kingdom by my side . Merely to help me continue it . ”
97266	97274	97275	97275	She	2225	“ You would n’t touch someone else . ”
97283	97288	97275	97275	She	2225	“ You would n’t . ”
97289	97292	97293	97293	I	3485	“ Really ? ”
97301	97308	97293	97293	I	3485	“ What makes you say that ? ”
97358	97368	97369	97369	she	2225	“ You will never find what we have elsewhere , ”
97372	97387	97369	97369	she	2225	“ And you ’re the stupidest smart man alive to think that you can . ”
97388	97395	97396	97396	I	3485	“ Are you done being dramatic ? ”
97415	97422	97423	97423	she	2225	“ Are you done being heartless ? ”
97426	97446	97396	97396	I	3485	“ No . Which brings us to the only reason you ’re still here — you’re not pregnant yet . ”
97447	97462	97463	97463	She	2225	“ Have you considered I might not be able to have children at all ? ”
97478	97482	97483	97483	I	3485	“ I have , ”
97486	97520	97483	97483	I	3485	“ The minute I came up with this plan , I made a list of pros , cons , and potential complications . Possible infertility was at the top of the cons list . ”
97521	97524	97563	97563	She	2225	“ And ? ”
97525	97531	97483	97483	I	3485	“ And everyone is replaceable . ”
97540	97544	97545	97545	she	2225	“ I see , ”
97549	97562	97545	97545	she	2225	“ In that case , do n’t let me waste your time . ”
97582	97605	97606	97606	she	2225	“ I ’ll be continuing my employment with the Arrowsmiths . You can find another suitable candidate to have your precious children , ”
97777	97783	97784	97784	She	2225	“ You ’re still here . ”
97808	97817	97802	97802	she	2225	“ Why ? I told you my decision . ”
97818	97824	97825	97825	I	3485	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
97829	97840	97841	97841	She	2225	“ The only stupid thing I did was marry you . ”
98119	98130	98131	98131	He	157	“ So this is how you chose to play this ? ”
98169	98173	98174	98174	I	3485	“ Play what ? ”
98178	98186	98174	98174	I	3485	“ You know exactly what went missing . ”
98251	98256	98257	98257	he	157	“ Where is it ? ”
98260	98265	98257	98257	he	157	“ Where ’s what ? ”
98266	98274	98257	98257	he	157	“ The thing you stole from me . ”
98292	98305	98286	98286	I	3485	“ Still does n’t ring any bells . Care to be specific ? ”
98306	98318	98319	98319	He	157	“ Cut the bullcrap , Fitzpatrick . Where ’s my money ? ”
98377	98399	98370	98370	I	3485	“ What ’s money in the grand scheme of things , Andy my friend ? You have the Arctic to save . ”
98400	98426	98427	98427	He	157	“ You wo n’t be so smug when I knock on the FBI ’s door and tell them how much money you stole from me . ”
98437	98485	98427	98427	He	157	“ Please let me know when you do that , so I can pay a visit to the IRS and inform them you ’ve been keeping undeclared millions in offshore accounts . A sure way to kill your nonprofit career faster than a fish out of water . ”
98531	98537	98538	98538	he	157	“ You think I care ? ”
98541	98582	98524	98524	He	157	“ You think that ’d stop me from sending Tinder and Tree to Evon ? To give them all the things your family stole from me ? You can never touch my personal wealth . My wife is a millionaire . ”
98583	98590	98591	98591	I	3485	“ No , her parents are , ”
98617	98645	98646	98646	I	3485	“ Real estate , right ? Her daddy is a property tycoon type ? Bet there ’s a whole can of worms to explore there , too , ”
98649	98665	98646	98646	I	3485	“ Never met a New York real estate mogul who liked to pay his taxes . ”
98718	98735	98708	98708	Andrew	157	“ Remember one thing , Fitzpatrick . Your wife visits our house frequently . She talks . ”
98800	98807	98808	98808	He	157	“ Watch your back , Cillian . ”
98813	98826	98808	98808	He	157	“ I broke you before . I intend to do it again . ”
98830	98850	98827	98827	I	3485	“ Give it your best shot , Andy . I sure as hell am going to do the same . ”
99076	99083	99084	99084	I	3485	“ I know you ’re there , ”
99144	99156	99157	99157	Persephone	3162	“ I ’m not trying to pretend I ’m not here , ”
99199	99207	99172	99172	she	800	“ You have marital duties to perform . ”
99208	99237	99245	99245	She	800	“ If you think you ’re walking through that door , you ’re not just a cold fish , Cillian . You ’re a dumb one , too . ”
99278	99286	99265	99265	I	3485	“ I ’ll be quick about it . ”
99287	99290	99265	99265	I	3485	“ No . ”
99291	99294	99265	99265	I	3485	“ Please . ”
99318	99344	99265	99265	I	3485	“ Go to Europe , Cillian . Have fun with your little girlfriends . Maybe they ’ll give you the child you want so badly . ”
100210	100244	100179	100179	she	772	“ … ripping him a new one . You have to calm down , Kill . You ’ve been going so hard at Arrowsmith . You ’re lucky people have n’t noticed yet . ”
100245	100254	100179	100179	she	772	“ Kill thinks luck is just lazy math . ”
100255	100292	100179	100179	she	772	“ Kill is not thinking at all . Check out his face . He looks like he is about to kick all of us out again so he can have a snuggling session with Wifey Dearest . ”
100471	100478	100479	100479	Persephone	3162	“ You ’ve been following me ! ”
100513	100551	100479	100479	Persephone	3162	“ I found your stupid soldiers waiting by my car when I left Mrs. Veitch ’s nursing home , so I decided to chase them . Got one guy ’s beanie . The other was too fast . ”
100552	100561	100562	100562	Sam	2667	“ Which one did you manage to catch ? ”
100566	100575	100562	100562	Sam	2667	“ So I ’ll know who to fire . ”
100588	100600	100583	100583	She	772	“ Shut up , Brennan . Just shut the hell up ! ”
100745	100753	100754	100754	I	3485	“ Back to hysterics , I see , ”
100762	100813	100754	100754	I	3485	“ Care to tell me something I do n’t know ? I told you about my plans last week . One of them was to have you tailed . Did you think I was n’t going to follow through with my threats ? Did you think you were … special ? ”
100848	100858	100859	100859	she	2303	“ You ’re following through on all your threats , ”
100920	100925	100916	100916	I	3485	“ All of them . ”
100926	100934	100935	100935	she	2303	“ Following me was against the contract , ”
100954	100973	100974	100974	I	3485	“ Actually , I found a loophole . Sam did the following . I only gave the order . ”
100977	100985	100986	100986	Sam	2667	“ The devil is in the details . ”
100995	101016	101017	101017	I	3485	“ Now , that ’s just bad manners , Brennan . Show some respect to the mistress of the house . ”
101032	101035	101017	101017	I	3485	“ Apologize . ”
101036	101041	101042	101042	Sam	2667	“ My sincere apologies . ”
101071	101078	101054	101054	He	2667	“ My heart bleeds for you . ”
101208	101215	101216	101216	I	3485	“ Ready for my monster hand ? ”
101289	101292	101293	101293	Hunter	489	“ Goddamn . ”
101302	101307	101293	101293	Hunter	489	“ You always win . ”
101482	101485	101486	101486	My	3485	“ Petar ! ”
101553	101561	101562	101562	Petar	142	“ Sir , do you need anything ? ”
101573	101587	101547	101547	She	3223	“ Yes . I need to know where the fuck is my wife ? ”
101616	101638	101608	101608	He	142	“ I … ah … she … she did n’t say . I figured she was going on a weekend somewhere ? ”
101639	101647	101648	101648	I	3485	“ And why would you figure that ? ”
101654	101673	101608	101608	He	142	“ Well , because she took several suitcases with her and did n’t want any help with them . ”
101674	101683	101684	101684	I	3485	“ Did she say where she was going ? ”
101687	101692	101608	101608	He	142	“ No , sir . ”
101693	101703	101608	101608	He	142	“ How many suitcases did she take with her ? ”
101704	101709	101608	101608	He	142	“ Quite a few . ”
101710	101720	101608	101608	He	142	“ Do you know how to count , Petar ? ”
101721	101726	101608	101608	He	142	“ Yes , sir . ”
101727	101744	101608	101608	He	142	“ Now ’s the time to use those math skills and give me a fucking number . ”
101755	101765	101608	101608	He	142	“ Seven . She took seven suitcases , sir . ”
101766	101777	101778	101778	I	3485	“ And you thought she was going for a weekend , ”
102109	102118	102119	102119	Sailor	772	“ I ’m going to kill my brother , ”
102211	102222	102223	102223	Belle	485	“ You ’ll off Sam , I ’ll murder Kill , ”
102233	102263	102223	102223	Belle	485	“ I ’m leaning toward castrating him and letting him bleed out . Not necessarily using a blunt object . Something that would make the process slow and painful . ”
102264	102286	102287	102287	Ash	120	“ Medically speaking , I do n’t think there ’s a non - painful way to castrate a man to death , ”
102301	102308	102287	102287	Ash	120	“ Was it really that bad ? ”
102309	102315	102316	102316	Sailor	772	“ Yes , it was , ”
102326	102382	102316	102316	Sailor	772	“ You know Pers , she ’d never breathe a bad word about someone if her life depended on it . Hunter was there , and he told me himself . Said he was shocked by Kill ’s behavior . Recently , he was under the impression Cillian and you had a good thing going . ”
102383	102395	102396	102396	I	3485	“ Honestly ? I was dumb enough to think the same . ”
102451	102525	102526	102526	Ash	120	“ You know I think Kill having private investigators follow you is deplorable , but you never actually told us what the nature of your relationship was . Again , I ’m not trying to make excuses for my brother . I grew up seeing him at his best and his worst , so I know both versions of him are frightening to the average person . But your relationship was never explained , ”
102530	102550	102526	102526	Ash	120	“ I just want to make sure we ’re getting the entire picture so we can advise you accordingly . ”
102551	102558	102559	102559	Belle	485	“ Ash ’s got a point . ”
102565	102580	102581	102581	She	485	“ You just told us you ’re getting hitched one day , then poof ! ”
102586	102641	102581	102581	She	485	“ You were a married woman . Every time we see you with your husband , he looks at you like you ’re the brightest star in the sky . At the same time , we all know you did not go the usual couple route . Tell us how you became Mrs. Fitzpatrick . ”
102724	102794	102721	102721	I	3485	“ When Paxton left me , he did n’t leave me with nothing . He left me with a hundred thousand dollars of debt . It was the worst eight months of my life . The loan sharks he ’d been indebted to chased me around , lurked outside my workplace , patrolled Belle ’s apartment … it got real bad . They even physically attacked me one time . ”
102836	102878	102830	102830	I	3485	“ It was the time I told you I got mugged . I did n’t want to ask Hunter , Sailor , or Aisling for the money . It was n’t a small sum . It was a straight up fortune . ”
102879	102886	102887	102887	Aisling	106	“ We would n’t have minded ! ”
102891	102897	102898	102898	Sailor	772	“ Do n’t be stupid . ”
102903	102918	102898	102898	Sailor	772	“ Of course you could ’ve asked us for it . You ’re family . ”
102942	103005	102919	102919	I	3485	“ When things went from bad to worse with the creditors , I went to Cillian ’s office and asked for a loan . He said no . A few days later , he came back with the marriage proposal . He said all my problems would go away if I said yes , and … well , he kept his promise . ”
103110	103119	103120	103120	I	3485	“ Wanna know what the worst part is ? ”
103141	103264	103120	103120	I	3485	“ That I still love him . I ’ve always loved him . The first time I saw him at that charity ball Sailor dragged us to because she did n’t want to be alone with Hunter and I set my sight on Cillian , I knew . I knew one day he would take my soul , set it on fire , and walk all over my ashes when it was all done and dealt with . I ’d known it from the very moment I found myself staring at him while he was watching Emmabelle from across the room . He was lost in my sister , but I found myself — everything I ’d ever wanted — in him . ”
103265	103276	103277	103277	Ash	120	“ Kill never looks directly at the things he wants . ”
103282	103303	103277	103277	Ash	120	“ He says desire is a weakness . If he wanted Belle , he would n’t have looked at her . ”
103304	103313	103314	103314	I	3485	“ I do n’t know what to do . ”
103324	103362	103314	103314	I	3485	“ I told him I want a divorce after the Green Living lawsuit is over . I need to leave . Leave before he breaks whatever ’s still left in me . Leave before he leaves me . ”
103482	103658	103475	103475	Belle	485	“ My mind and my heart are at war right now . I ca n’t believe I ’m saying this , but I ’m about to give you my heart ’s advice . Remember at the cabin , all those months ago ? When Cillian bet his ass in poker and left the money for Sailor and me to take ? The only thing he asked was for us not to badmouth him to you . It was very telling , mostly because Kill ’s name is being dragged through the mud on a daily basis in the news and he does n’t seem to give a shit . I think he cares for you . I think he does n’t want to care for you , but he does . He does n’t want your loved ones to tell you not to be with him . I lost a bet , and I intend to respect it . I ca n’t tell you to leave him , Pers . Not now . Not yet . ”
103663	103686	103687	103687	Sailor	772	“ Sam always says , a child who is not loved by his village will burn it down to feel its warmth , ”
103713	103772	103773	103773	Sailor	772	“ I think Cillian has been watching everything around him burn for far too long . The Fitzpatrick men are wounded , but they hide it very well , and from what I gather , very differently . If anyone can stop him from destroying the rest of the world , it ’s you . Give him time , ”
103776	103786	103773	103773	Sailor	772	“ It ’s the most precious gift of all . ”
103816	103818	103820	103823	her lower lip—“my brother	3984	“ I think”—she
103822	103884	103885	103885	She	772	lip—“my brother wants you . I think he cares for you . But I also know he was the same man who blackmailed you into marrying him . He knew your life was in danger , and he took advantage of you . I do n’t know if this is the kind of environment you want to raise your child in . ”
103898	103931	103885	103885	She	772	“ I grew up in a dysfunctional family , and I do n’t have it in me to recommend you go the same route . I do n’t think you should stay . ”
104155	104165	104166	104166	Joelle	3223	“ Guess who is here , and with presents ! ”
104235	104246	104247	104247	Tinder	196	“ Auntie Persy , look what I made for you . ”
104300	104331	104332	104332	Tinder	196	“ It ’s a map . If we follow it , we ’ll get to heaven , and in heaven , everyone is nice , and no one hits you ! ”
104360	104367	104368	104368	Tree	193	“ What ’d you get us ? ”
104376	104411	104368	104368	Tree	193	“ Is it a truck ? I told Mommy I want one for Christmas . Red . It has to be red . It must . Your favorite color , right , Auntie Persy ? ”
104412	104438	104439	104439	Joelle	3223	“ Tree , my gosh , why would you say that ? Any gift is welcome . The fact she thought about you is enough . ”
104594	104599	104600	104600	Andrew	157	“ You ’re here , ”
104629	104632	104621	104621	him	157	“ Andrew . ”
104633	104652	104679	104680	her husband	3052	“ How ’re you doing , sweetheart ? Is that savage husband of yours still giving you trouble ? ”
104653	104656	104657	104657	Joelle	3223	“ Andrew ! ”
104668	104673	104674	104674	I	3485	“ It ’s okay . ”
104682	104689	104674	104674	I	3485	“ Actually , I moved out . ”
104745	104749	104750	104750	His	3052	“ You did ? ”
104757	104765	104750	104750	His	3052	“ Why , if I may ask ? ”
104780	104795	104750	104750	His	3052	“ I ’m not so sure it ’s going to work out after all . ”
104796	104803	104750	104750	His	3052	“ I see . How unfortunate . ”
104808	104827	104804	104804	I	3485	“ Well , I have a day full of activities with the kids . I better get started . ”
104832	104854	104828	104828	He	3052	“ Yes . Of course . I wo n’t keep you . I have some … some phone calls to make . ”
104880	104918	104862	104862	He	3052	“ Thank you for sharing this information , Persephone . It means a lot to us to have your trust . You ’d tell us if Mr. Fitzpatrick mistreated you in any way , would n’t you ? ”
104939	104951	104862	104862	He	3052	“ Of course . You guys are like family to me . ”
104999	105008	105009	105009	She	3223	“ Thank you , you should n’t have . ”
105013	105021	105009	105009	She	3223	“ I know you save every penny . ”
105022	105028	105009	105009	She	3223	“ I love the boys . ”
105057	105071	105044	105044	He	196	“ Can y - you put it on m - me , Mommy ? ”
105098	105109	105086	105086	she	1880	“ I … of course . Turn around , sweetie . ”
105208	105216	105217	105217	Joelle	3223	“ I was raised by au pairs , ”
105233	105256	105217	105217	Joelle	3223	“ I thought that ’s the way things were supposed to be . I never planned on having a son who is … ”
105257	105260	105261	105261	I	3485	“ Special ? ”
105267	105302	105261	105261	I	3485	“ It ’s a blessing . It makes you grow . Find your strength . There ’s a lot we can learn from children . Things we ’d already forgotten but should n’t have . ”
105303	105307	105217	105217	Joelle	3223	“ Like what ? ”
105308	105354	105355	105355	I	3485	“ Like what ’s important in life . Family . Friendship . The beauty of a lone cloud sailing across a perfectly blue sky . Kids have their priorities straight . It ’s us adults who sometimes forget the meaning of life . Now come . ”
105387	105409	105376	105377	my husband	600	“ Let ’s make new memories with the boys . It ’s not too late . It ’s never too late . ”
105544	105554	105555	105555	He	196	“ I ’m doing it ! I ’m riding ! ”
105578	105586	105587	105587	She	3223	“ I never thought he ’d learn . ”
105590	105596	105587	105587	She	3223	“ Thank you so much . ”
105597	105632	105633	105633	Tinder	196	“ I’m - I’m - I’m going to - to - to tell D - D - Daddy I can ride a bike . Maybe he ’ll come downstairs and s - see us ? ”
105659	105680	105646	105646	Joelle	3223	“ That ’s a great idea , Tin ! I ’m sure he ’s going to be over the moon . ”
105701	105709	105710	105710	Tree	193	“ Mommy ! Look ! No hands ! ”
105863	105878	105879	105879	I	3485	“ Just fucking say it . Do n’t stutter it . Say . It ! ”
105904	105944	105879	105879	I	3485	“ I ca n’t fucking listen to you anymore , you no - good piece of … piece of … crap ! You remind me of him . You ’re just like him . A little , stupid loser . ”
106049	106052	106039	106039	He	157	“ Persephone . ”
106096	106127	106082	106082	Tinder	196	“ It ’s a map . If we follow it , we ’ll get to heaven , and in heaven , everyone is nice , and no one hits you . ”
106213	106223	106224	106224	Andrew	157	“ Look , I know what it looks like … ”
106249	106268	106244	106244	I	3485	“ I ’m not ready to talk about what I witnessed here before I talk with your wife . ”
106269	106275	106276	106276	Joelle	3223	“ What ’s happening here ? ”
106317	106330	106307	106307	her	3223	“ Oh , no . What did you do now , Andy ? ”
106340	106349	106350	106350	Andrew	157	“ I just told him to speak clearly . ”
106374	106379	106380	106380	I	3485	“ He shook him , ”
106408	106433	106396	106396	Kids	486	“ I ’m going to take the boys downstairs to make a sponge cake . I ’m sure you have things to talk about . ”
106454	106472	106473	106473	Tree	193	“ Can we make triangle sandwiches first and cut off the crust ? I hate the crust . ”
106476	106494	106531	106531	He	157	“ Of course . What about you , Tin ? Would you like anything for a snack ? ”
106495	106530	106531	106531	He	157	“ A - A - Ants on a log , please . S - S - Sorry I made Daddy upset with my stut - stut - stuttering . I did n’t mean to . ”
106545	106584	106531	106531	He	157	“ Nonsense . I want you to remember something very important , okay , boys ? Something I want you to carry with you everywhere , no matter where you go , like the necklace I gave you . ”
106620	106702	106607	106607	They	2418	“ Whenever Daddy loses his temper and yells at you , it ’s not your fault . We are not responsible for other people ’s actions . Only for our own . That is not to say we are never wrong . It is our job to try to do our best to become better and always hold ourselves accountable for our own actions . But never blame yourself for what Daddy or Mommy is doing , okay ? Promise me . ”
106703	106708	106709	106709	Tree	193	“ Scout ’s honor ! ”
106715	106723	106724	106724	Tinder	196	“ I - I promise , too ! ”
106801	106814	106785	106785	I	3485	“ Really , dude ? You promised he would n’t be here . ”
106875	106932	106868	106868	Petar	142	“ He was n’t supposed to come until ten or eleven , I swear . Ever since you left the house , he ’s only come here to sleep . Sometimes not even that . Three times I had to send a courier to the office with a new set of suits for him this week . ”
106976	106981	106982	106982	I	3485	“ Where is she ? ”
107054	107059	107060	107060	I	3485	“ Back so early ? ”
107079	107093	107060	107060	I	3485	“ What would Daddy say ? I thought you were born to work . ”
107104	107112	107113	107113	I	3485	“ Should n’t you be at work ? ”
107125	107135	107136	107136	he	142	“ Should n’t you be living with your husband ? ”
107140	107143	107144	107144	I	3485	“ No , ”
107159	107202	107144	107144	I	3485	“ You spent the past few months cementing the fact that we are n’t a real couple . All I ’m doing is finally listening to you . You did a great job convincing me we ’re nothing more than a contract . ”
107314	107323	107324	107324	he	142	“ I told Sam to pull the surveillance , ”
107340	107343	107324	107324	he	142	“ And ? ”
107344	107361	107362	107362	His	142	“ And I have n’t touched anyone since I put a ring on your goddamn finger . ”
107373	107376	107377	107377	I	3485	“ And ? ”
107390	107400	107401	107401	he	142	“ And I should n’t have broken the contract , ”
107410	107415	107401	107401	he	142	“ I trust you . ”
107416	107419	107420	107420	I	3485	“ Bullshit , ”
107503	107509	107510	107510	he	142	“ You ’re not leaving , ”
107530	107535	107510	107510	he	142	“ I ’m sorry . ”
107543	107548	107536	107536	He	142	“ Sorry for what ? ”
107549	107635	107510	107510	he	142	“ For changing the rules on you . For breaking the contract . For asking for more . I realize that I was out of line . I want you to marry someone who gives you what you want . Who is happy with what you ’re willing to give back . And I ’m not that person . I meant what I said . As soon as your legal / PR issues are over and everything quiets down , we can get a divorce . ”
107652	107660	107661	107661	He	142	“ All this because of one mistake ? ”
107664	107685	107661	107661	He	142	“ I already told you I have n’t touched anyone else . You were watched exactly one week , Persephone . ”
107694	107772	107686	107686	I	3485	“ You think that ’s the only problem ? One mistake ? Get real , Kill . You never treated me as your wife . Never spent the entire night in my bed . Never took me on one date that was n’t a fancy event . No honeymoon . No meaningful conversation . I was never your equal . The only thing that ’s changed is that now , I finally realize I never will be . ”
107823	107862	107798	107798	he	3485	“ I dined with you every evening . I fucked you every night . I took you to balls . To family dinners . I bought you jewelry . What more do you want from me , Persephone ? ”
107863	107867	107868	107868	I	3485	“ A relationship . ”
107879	107889	107890	107890	he	3485	“ I do n’t know how to have one ! ”
107906	107941	107798	107798	he	3485	“ I do n’t know what that even means . I never had a relationship . You request something , and I make it happen . Is that not what a relationship is about ? ”
107956	107965	107966	107966	I	3485	“ How did you know I was here ? ”
107969	107985	107986	107986	He	3485	“ This house is wired more than a police informant in a bad cop show . ”
107996	108005	107986	107986	He	3485	“ So you left everything and came here ? ”
108014	108025	108006	108006	He	3485	“ You talk like I do n’t give a damn . ”
108026	108031	108006	108006	He	3485	“ You do n’t . ”
108032	108037	108038	108038	He	3485	“ Well , newsflash . ”
108069	108095	108063	108063	he	3485	“ I do . I ’m not fucking happy about it , to be sure , but that does n’t make it any less true . ”
108152	108159	108160	108160	His	3485	“ Come home , Flower Girl . ”
108212	108247	108203	108203	Kill	3067	“ Let me fuck you . Be the wife I need . You just need a bit more training . A few more months and we can fuck each other out of our system . ”
108284	108310	108271	108271	He	3485	“ Give me one reason to stay , Cillian . I ’m not asking for many . Just the one . Something to hold onto . ”
108311	108318	108271	108271	He	3485	“ Because I want you to . ”
108319	108332	108271	108271	He	3485	“ No . Something else . Something that ’s not completely selfish . ”
108333	108343	108344	108344	he	3485	“ I ca n’t be anything other than selfish , ”
108360	108375	108271	108271	He	3485	“ As soon as the lawsuit is over , we ’re getting a divorce . ”
108813	108828	108829	108829	I	3485	“ You really have some nerve coming here after the conversation we just had . ”
109106	109115	109103	109104	Paxton Veitch	172	“ What the fuck are you doing here ? ”
109230	109233	109234	109234	His	2033	“ Babe . ”
109249	109270	109234	109234	His	2033	“ Fuck , you look just as gorgeous as I remember . Holy shit , Persy . Look at you . ”
109418	109424	109425	109425	I	3485	“ I ’ll repeat myself . ”
109431	109449	109425	109425	I	3485	“ What ’re you doing here , Paxton ? And how did you know where I live ? ”
109450	109470	109425	109425	I	3485	“ Dropped by Grandma Greta ’s nursing home . Your name and address were listed as an emergency contact . ”
109471	109486	109425	109425	I	3485	“ That ’s right because you , her only living relative , were MIA . ”
109487	109491	109492	109492	His	172	“ I know . ”
109496	109509	109492	109492	His	172	“ I ’m here to make amends . Let me ? Please ? ”
109555	109573	109574	109574	I	3485	“ Give me one good reason not to tell Byrne and Kaminski you ’re back in town . ”
109642	109650	109612	109612	he	172	“ Wow . Okay . Nice digs . ”
109676	109709	109669	109669	he	172	“ C’m on , babe . It ’s been a minute . We need to iron things out , but there ’s a lot to talk about , do n’t you think ? ”
109784	109792	109793	109793	I	3485	“ I ’m not buying your charade , ”
109797	109800	109801	109801	His	142	“ Fine . ”
109809	109840	109841	109841	Paxton	172	“ Then let ’s get real . I ’m glad your bouji ass is living the good life . Got yourself a sugar daddy and found your sass , huh ? ”
109974	109994	109995	109995	I	3485	“ The word you are looking for is a husband . My husband does well for himself , yes , ”
109998	110053	109995	109995	I	3485	“ But even more important than his deep pockets , he was kind enough to get me out of the trouble you got me into . Knowing Cillian , he wo n’t appreciate you being here , so I suggest you get out of here before he does the job Byrne could n’t finish . ”
110068	110096	110054	110054	Paxton	172	“ Do n’t tell me you fell in love with him . That ’s such a sap move , Pers . Rich boys do n’t have hearts . ”
110097	110107	110054	110054	Paxton	172	“ Neither do poor ones from Southie , apparently . ”
110121	110211	110054	110054	Paxton	172	“ Look , I know I have n’t been the man you deserve , babe . But I needed a way out . I knew you were going to get us out of trouble . I could n’t keep in touch while you were working on getting us out of this , but I stood on the sidelines and watched , ready to pounce if they actually did something to you . I always had your back , Pers . I did this to protect you . Protect us . ”
110235	110320	110054	110054	Paxton	172	“ Our goodbye was temporary . I always planned to come back . You were smart , resourceful , and responsible . I just needed you to do me this little solid . When I saw the article about your marriage to Cillian Fitzpatrick , I wanted to kiss you . I thought , ‘ that ’s my girl . ’ I was beginning to worry Byrne would follow up on his threat to pimp you out . I was about to step in . ”
110388	110396	110397	110397	I	3485	“ You knew they were following me ? ”
110404	110428	110401	110401	He	3485	“ I kept an eye on you the entire time . Made sure you were okay . I was worried sick , Pers . ”
110429	110435	110482	110482	his	3485	“ I was n’t okay . ”
110436	110452	110401	110401	He	3485	“ You really need to give yourself more credit , babe . You did great . ”
110453	110462	110463	110463	I	3485	“ How did you keep tabs on me ? ”
110466	110469	110401	110401	He	3485	“ Friends . ”
110470	110474	110401	110401	He	3485	“ Which friends ? ”
110475	110479	110480	110480	He	3485	“ C’m on . ”
110494	110501	110502	110502	I	3485	“ Where were you , Paxton ? ”
110551	110556	110557	110557	Paxton	172	“ Here and there , ”
110592	110604	110605	110605	I	3485	“ You either answer my questions or I ’m calling security . ”
110620	110638	110613	110613	He	172	“ How ’d you think I ended up here ? The security in this place is trash . ”
110639	110642	110644	110644	my	3485	“ In that case”—I
110650	110680	110644	110644	my	3485	screen—“I’ll call my husband . Do n’t let his rich - boy reputation confuse you . He is very good with his hands , beyond just making me come . ”
110690	110694	110695	110695	he	172	“ Do n’t , ”
110699	110720	110695	110695	he	172	“ Fine . Whatever , Persy . You wanna play ? I ’m game . What do you wanna know ? ”
110721	110732	110681	110681	Paxton	172	“ Who told you about Byrne and Kaminski following me ? ”
110733	110736	110737	110737	Mitch	406	“ Mitch . ”
110750	110775	110737	110737	Mitch	406	“ He was still hustling for Colin a few months after I bailed . Still shoots the shit with Kaminski every now and again . ”
110776	110784	110681	110681	Paxton	172	“ Where were you all this time ? ”
110785	110999	110737	110737	Mitch	406	“ Costa Rica was my first stop . The day word got out that Byrne knew I blew all our savings and could n’t pay him back , I bought a one - way ticket . I laid low there . Worked in construction . Saved up whatever I could . At first , I ’d hoped I could come up with half the money , then pay the rest in Boston . I always wanted it to work between us , Persy . I just knew keeping in touch with you was going to put you in a whole lotta risk . Then the news of you marrying Fitzpatrick broke the fucking internet . There were memes about it , dude . I picked up the phone and called Mitch . Asked if it was true . He told me your husband made sure Kaminski could never take a piss standing up again he trashed him so bad . Byrne was n’t doing so hot , either . I realized I was probably next on your husband ’s shit list . That he was going to unleash Sam Brennan on me . Brennan has eyes and ears everywhere , so I moved up to Mexico . Cancun . Stayed with a friend . ”
111000	111004	111005	111005	I	3485	“ A friend ? ”
111035	111083	111022	111022	Cillian	142	“ A chick from high school . She ’s running a spring break resort there . It was always crowded , lots of people moving in and out . I knew Brennan would have a bitch of a time catching me there . I cleaned her pool . ”
111084	111090	111091	111091	I	3485	“ Platonically , I assume . ”
111106	111145	111022	111022	Cillian	142	“ Please , Pers . Let ’s not pretend you have n’t been sucking Fitzpatrick ’s cock every night the better half of this year . We both did what we had to do in order to survive . ”
111146	111157	111158	111158	I	3485	“ In my case , I enjoyed the task immensely , ”
111161	111177	111158	111158	I	3485	“ You have n’t even picked up the phone to check in on your grandmother . ”
111208	111289	111198	111198	Paxton	172	“ I knew you would take care of her . I ’d trust you with my own life . You always do the right thing . Listen , we ’re out of the woods now . Mitch told me the debt has been paid . Byrne ’s out of the picture . We can be together , Persy . Start over fresh . Pick up where we left off . He did n’t make you sign a prenup , right ? ”
111360	111371	111372	111372	I	3485	“ We ’re happily divorced . I married someone else . ”
111459	111494	111495	111495	He	2033	“ I get it , babe . You ’re angry . You ’re hurt . You have every right to be . But you ’re not fooling anyone . Your marriage is n’t real . ”
111510	111534	111535	111535	I	3485	“ Ours was n’t , either . In the spirit of being candid , I , too , have a confession to make . ”
111553	111582	111535	111535	I	3485	“ You were always nothing more than a distraction . It was always Kill . You were on borrowed time . But Cillian ? Cillian is my forever . ”
111647	111651	111652	111652	he	172	“ All right , ”
111655	111674	111652	111652	he	172	“ You win . I ’ll be the side piece . But it ’s gon na cost ya . ”
111675	111728	111766	111766	His	172	“ I do n’t want a side piece . Even if I did , you would be the last person on the planet I ’d consider . You are mean and selfish , Paxton . Get out of my apartment before I speed - dial Sam Brennan and throw you out myself . ”
111729	111732	111733	111733	he	172	“ Babe , ”
111752	111765	111733	111733	he	172	“ I know you ’re pissed , but we were good together . ”
111802	111809	111810	111810	I	3485	“ I do n’t want good , ”
111855	111872	111849	111849	I	3485	“ I want divine , and I found it . Get the hell out , Veitch . ”
111873	111886	111898	111898	He	172	“ You ’re crazy if you think I ’m letting you go . ”
111918	111978	111912	111912	he	172	“ I ’ll change your mind . I won you once , and I can do it again . Whether it ’s the easy way or the hard way , you ’ll be writhing beneath me in no time , and when you are , I promise you , Persephone , I will make sure your husband knows it . ”
111979	111982	111983	111983	He	172	“ Out ! ”
112037	112040	112035	112035	I	3485	“ I do ”
112048	112058	112059	112059	I	3485	“ You dumb piece of cock - sucking shit . ”
112174	112182	112183	112183	he	2667	“ Good morning to you , too , ”
112224	112233	112216	112216	anyone	592	“ To what do I owe this greeting ? ”
112234	112260	112261	112261	I	3485	“ To being a bullshit private investigator and a terrible fucking friend . You slacked off . Guess how my wife spent her night yesterday ? ”
112289	112297	112298	112298	he	2667	“ With your dick in her ass ? ”
112328	112344	112321	112321	He	2667	“ I suggest you try other holes if you ’re interested in knocking her up . ”
112345	112352	112298	112298	he	2667	“ You ’re a sick human . ”
112353	112357	112358	112358	He	2667	“ Thank you . ”
112367	112374	112298	112298	he	2667	“ It was n’t a compliment . ”
112375	112401	112358	112358	He	2667	“ To me , it was . Most people do n’t consider me human at all . So what was your wife up to yesterday ? ”
112454	112462	112463	112463	I	3485	“ Paxton Veitch paid her a visit . ”
112491	112497	112481	112481	Sam	2667	“ He ’s in town ? ”
112498	112505	112481	112481	Sam	2667	“ You should ’ve known that . ”
112506	112525	112526	112526	He	2667	“ You told me not to check on him . You were fucking specific about it , too . ”
112566	112573	112574	112574	I	3485	“ You need to tail him , ”
112577	112589	112574	112574	I	3485	“ Find out why he ’s here . What he wants . ”
112590	112643	112644	112644	He	172	“ I can tell you right now why he ’s here — he ’s here because his ex - wife just married into one of the wealthiest families in the country , and because he is a money - grabbing scumbag . Do you need me to deal - deal with him ? ”
112878	112914	112868	112868	I	3485	“ Do n’t touch him . Just find out as much as you can . Where he lives , what he ’s doing , what ’s his angle . I ’ll deal with him myself . ”
112918	112927	112915	112915	Sam	2667	“ Do it now . Drop everything else . ”
112931	112939	112915	112915	Sam	2667	“ Anything else you want to know ? ”
112961	112968	112969	112969	I	3485	“ Just do your fucking job . ”
113074	113088	113089	113089	I	3485	“ I should not have eaten the sashimi . It upset my stomach , ”
113108	113132	113102	113102	Devon	177	“ The sashimi was fine . The queasy feeling in your gut is longing . Is Persy still living in her Commonwealth flat ? ”
113536	113563	113528	113529	Colin Byrne	133	“ Veitch wanted to whore out his wife all by himself before he fucked off . He wanted to kidnap her and give her to me . ”
113669	113676	113677	113677	I	3485	“ Give me Paxton ’s address . ”
113801	113805	113806	113806	I	3485	“ Paxton Veitch , ”
113868	113879	113883	113884	the men	1689	“ I ’ll ask again , where ’s Paxton Veitch ? ”
113895	113923	113924	113926	one of them	738	“ Oh , for fuck ’s sake , we do n’t even know him , why are we protecting him ? He ’s in the back room ! ”
113937	113952	113924	113926	one of them	738	“ Take the stairs up . His is the second door on the left . ”
114104	114109	114123	114123	I	3485	“ Oh , Paxton , ”
114176	114191	114221	114221	I	3485	“ God , you ’re so fucking sweet . What ’s your name again ? ”
114192	114195	114221	114221	I	3485	“ Persephone . ”
114196	114203	114204	114204	His	2521	“ Persy - phone - ay . ”
114214	114220	114204	114204	His	2521	“ What does it mean ? ”
114357	114390	114391	114391	He	172	“ You think I ’m not trying ? It ’s not as easy as I thought . She ’s changed , man . Probably all that dough and gold - plated cock . ”
114396	114453	114391	114391	He	172	“ I ’m not gon na hurt her . I still love Persy , you know . She ’s always been my girl . I just want in with her ass , so I can get my way , too . There ’s too much money in that pot for me not to get my share . ”
114503	114506	114492	114492	He	172	“ Shi — ”
114531	114540	114523	114523	He	172	“ Time for a little talk , Veitch . ”
114541	114548	114549	114549	His	172	“ You ’re the Fitzpatrick guy . ”
114553	114559	114549	114549	His	172	“ The dude she married . ”
114560	114572	114523	114523	He	172	“ And here I thought you were just a pretty face . ”
114622	114634	114614	114614	Paxton	172	“ Look , man , I do n’t want any trouble . ”
114635	114665	114714	114714	she	2528	“ If you did n’t want trouble , you would n’t chase it across the planet . Do you really think I ’d let you touch what ’s mine ? ”
114671	114711	114666	114666	He	172	“ I do n’t know what to think . All I know is that Persy and I had a good thing going . I fucked up , but she ’s a good girl . She could still forgive me . ”
114782	114792	114793	114793	I	3485	“ Do n’t mistake Persephone ’s goodness with naiveté , ”
114796	114803	114793	114793	I	3485	“ She is past forgiving you . ”
114804	114814	114815	114815	He	172	“ You do n’t know her like I do . ”
114820	114910	114793	114793	I	3485	“ What I do know is that you tried to pay Byrne with her as currency , which is why I ’m here . Now , you ’re going to listen carefully and follow my every instruction , and I will spare your miserable , pointless life . Veer off the lane I put you on , and I ’ll make sure you slam into a ten - ton semi - trailer and feed whatever ’s left of you to the hyenas . Are you following me so far ? ”
114950	115196	114911	114911	He	2530	“ You ’re going to write a ten - page letter to Persephone , in which you apologize profusely for being the shittiest husband in the history of civilization . In this letter , you will take the entire blame for the fallout of your marriage and excuse her from any wrongdoings . I will read and approve the letter before you send it . After you send it , you will pack a bag , drive to the airport , and buy a one - way ticket to Australia . Once there , you will drive to Perth , where you will settle down . Perth , in case you ’re wondering , is the farthest point geographically from the US of A , and therefore exactly where I want you to be , at least until Virgin Galactic offers flights to Mars , to which I would be happy to relocate you . You will not , under any circumstances , contact my wife . You will not , under any circumstances , write , call , or meet her again . If I hear you as much as breathed in her direction , I will unleash my three - headed hounds on you — a Hades reference , in case it escaped your bird - sized brain — no matter where you are . I will make sure you experience the most painful death known to man . Tell me you understand . ”
115216	115220	115206	115206	Paxton	172	“ I understand . ”
115221	115245	115206	115206	Paxton	172	“ I will provide your flight ticket , accommodations , and a work permit . The rest is for you to deal with . ”
115246	115251	115206	115206	Paxton	172	“ I do n’t … ”
115252	115259	115260	115260	I	3485	“ This is not a conversation . ”
115267	115290	115260	115260	I	3485	“ This is me feeling uncharacteristically charitable and not blowing your brains out , mainly because blood makes my wife feel queasy . ”
115297	115309	115206	115206	Paxton	172	“ Forget she ’s ever been a part of your life . ”
115313	115319	115206	115206	Paxton	172	“ Oh , and Paxton ? ”
115360	115381	115337	115337	His	3485	“ How ’d you end up here ? We both know you do n’t have a penny to your name . ”
115382	115386	115387	115387	he	3485	“ Arruw Arrameeth , ”
115393	115397	115398	115398	I	3485	“ Andrew Arrowsmith ? ”
115417	115462	115398	115398	I	3485	“ He found me in Mexico . Paid for my flight back here . Got me this apartment and told me to get my girl . Said she was in trouble . That you were hurting her . Good guy . Nothing like you . ”
115494	115528	115479	115479	I	3485	“ That , I agree with . Do as I say , and nobody will get hurt . Other than Arrowsmith , but I suppose that ’s not your problem , is it ? ”
115569	115577	115578	115578	I	3485	“ Have a nice life , Veitch . ”
115603	115618	115619	115619	I	3485	“ My goodness , Tin , how did you get this boo - boo ? ”
115661	115663	115660	115664	the “ normal ” child	193	“ normal ”
115855	115863	115864	115864	he	196	“ T - This one , too , ”
115873	115894	115864	115864	he	196	“ Let ’s go to Walgreens and get super cool Band - Aids for them . What do you say ? ”
115895	115910	115911	115911	His	196	“ Y - Y - Yes ! Maybe they ’ll have Puppy Dog Pals . ”
115942	115947	115948	115948	I	3485	“ So what happened ? ”
115951	115968	115948	115948	I	3485	“ Did you fall off your bike ? I hope you know it happens to everyone . ”
115969	115972	115973	115973	he	196	“ No , ”
115977	115986	115973	115973	he	196	“ It was n’t t - the bike . ”
115987	115994	115948	115948	I	3485	“ What was it , then ? ”
116133	116138	116124	116124	Paxton	172	“ It was Daddy . ”
116224	116233	116234	116234	I	3485	“ How did he do this to you ? ”
116272	116281	116282	116282	He	196	“ I - I - I - I … ”
116294	116315	116282	116282	He	196	“ Oof ! I ca n’t get the words out . N - N - No wonder he hates me . ”
116316	116319	116320	116320	I	3485	“ Tinder , ”
116366	116410	116338	116338	He	196	“ I ’m not your father . I ’m your friend . You ’ve got all the time in the world to tell me what happened . I just want to know so I can help you . You are not in trouble . ”
116477	116486	116472	116472	him	196	“ Tell me everything , Tin - Tin . ”
116487	116493	116472	116472	him	196	“ He used a ruler . ”
116516	116640	116472	116472	him	196	“ He - He - He - He said that it works . He said he could c - c - cure me . Said he did it b - before . He told Mommy we will both be grateful when it - it was done and over with . He - he let me read the ABCs and then some n - n - numbers , and every time I stuttered or ha - ha - had a tic , he hit the metal ruler on my knees . He did it until I bled and M - M - Mommy told him she would call the police . I cried even though Mommy asked me no - no - not to . ”
116697	116711	116712	116712	I	3485	“ Is this the first time your daddy has done this to you ? ”
116733	116736	116737	116737	Tinder	196	“ No . ”
116747	116824	116737	116737	Tinder	196	“ One time , after we came back from a party where I embarrassed him , he put my head in a si - si - si - sink full of water , in and out , in a - and out . He - He - He said that he would only stop if I stopped a - acting like a weirdo . Bu - but it worked because I stopped for a whole week . ”
116884	116898	116998	116998	she	2550	“ Does your daddy treat your mommy and brother this way , too ? ”
116899	116943	116944	116944	He	2549	“ No . He loves Tree and tells him he will send him to a fancy school in England . I th - think he loves Mommy , too . Even if sometimes he pushes her around . He never pushes too hard . ”
116954	116995	116944	116944	He	2549	“ Other than the time he pushed her off the railings , and she fell downstairs . But she fell to the couch and was - wasn’t hurt . And she laughed about it so maybe it was a joke . ”
117282	117301	117278	117280	the little boy	196	“ Hey , Tin - Tin , feel like baking some cookies at home while watching Peter Pan ? ”
117302	117308	117311	117311	him	196	“ S - Sure do ! ”
117354	117357	117350	117350	Cillian	142	“ date . ”
117518	117525	117526	117526	He	196	“ W - What ’s happening ? ”
117529	117545	117526	117526	He	196	“ I - I do n’t like doing everything quickly . Are you going anywhere ? ”
117546	117556	117557	117557	I	3485	“ Not before I make sure you ’re okay , ”
117593	117652	117654	117655	his father	662	“ I ’m going to be a little busy in the next few minutes , okay ? But when I ’m done , we ’ll sit down with cookies and some chocolate milk and we ’ll have a talk . I need to tell you a few things . Do n’t worry , you are not in trouble . ”
117694	117705	117706	117706	I	3485	“ His laptop is probably going to be password protected , ”
117871	117877	117878	117878	Sam	2667	“ So Kill was right , ”
117913	117923	117904	117904	He	2667	“ You ’re not completely useless , after all . ”
117924	117936	117937	117937	I	3485	“ You do n’t think very highly of women , huh ? ”
117958	117968	117969	117969	Sam	2667	“ I thought you were a gold - digger , ”
117986	118002	117969	117969	Sam	2667	“ Shit , there ’s a lot of stuff in his cloud . Amateur mistake . ”
118003	118016	118017	118017	I	3485	“ Copy everything . I want to sort through all of it , ”
118032	118042	118017	118017	I	3485	“ And I ’m not a gold - digger . ”
118043	118047	118048	118048	He	2667	“ No shit . ”
118051	118079	118048	118048	He	2667	“ You ’re risking your ass here . You know that , right ? You can get a lot of jail time for what you ’re doing . ”
118080	118083	118084	118084	I	3485	“ Really ? ”
118090	118122	118084	118084	I	3485	“ I had no idea . Dumb it down for me . What ’s jail ? The one with the bars , right ? I think I ’ve seen a movie . ”
118136	118152	118123	118123	Sam	2667	“ So that ’s why he kept you all this time . You talk back . ”
118176	118182	118183	118183	Sam	2667	“ The coast was clear . ”
118188	118220	118183	118183	Sam	2667	“ The house is wired , but the idiot ’s cameras have crappy street view due to overgrown trees . Apparently , his conscience would n’t let him trim the fuckers . ”
118247	118275	118221	118221	He	2667	“ You sure you do n’t want me to go through it myself ? That ’s a lot of data . You ca n’t mess it up . ”
118276	118284	118354	118354	Men	1905	“ I will do a thorough job . ”
118285	118298	118221	118221	He	2667	“ Let me make a copy for myself . Just in case . ”
118299	118321	118322	118322	I	3485	“ If you make yourself a copy , I ’m going to make sure you lose your job with the Fitzpatricks . ”
118329	118346	118322	118322	I	3485	“ There may be some private things in there I do n’t want anyone to see . ”
118347	118353	118354	118354	Men	1905	“ Like a sex tape ? ”
118356	118359	118354	118354	Men	1905	“ Sure . ”
118421	118445	118452	118452	his	417	“ You do understand the concept of an arranged marriage , correct ? Nothing about what you have with your husband is real . ”
118446	118449	118450	118450	I	3485	“ Samuel , ”
118471	118480	118461	118461	I	3485	“ give me the flash drive , please . ”
118492	118501	118502	118502	He	417	“ I did n’t get it at first . ”
118512	118542	118543	118543	he	417	“ I thought he wanted Emmabelle . Every time the three of you were in the same room , his eyes were on her . But then I realized , ”
118548	118596	118543	118543	he	417	“ the timing was peculiar . See , Kill always looked at Emmabelle exactly at the same time you looked at him . He wanted to throw you off . To make you jealous . The first and last human thing I ’d ever seen him do . ”
118608	118633	118597	118597	Sam	2667	“ I ’ll relock the study . Andrew will never know we ’ve been in here . Proceed as normal when they get here . ”
118738	118761	118762	118762	I	3485	“ I ’ll be going away after today , but things are about to change here . I thought you should know . ”
118795	118801	118762	118762	I	3485	“ C - Change how ? ”
118802	118871	118872	118872	I	3485	“ Your father is not treating you well . He should n’t do the things he is doing , and I cannot — will not — be able to be here all the time to protect you . There will come a day when you grow up and make your mind up about what I ’m about to do . You will either hate me or appreciate me . ”
118907	118972	118902	118902	He	196	“ However you choose to feel about me , I will accept and respect it . I think I ’m going to put your daddy in a lot of trouble soon , but you will still have your mommy and your brother , and they ’re the important part , you hear me ? They ’re the part I want you to focus on . ”
119038	119053	119054	119054	He	196	“ Have I ever told you about The Wish Cloud , Tin - Tin ? ”
119059	119111	119054	119054	He	196	“ I ’m about to gift you one wish . Something to remember me by . But you ’ll have to choose your wish carefully . You only get one . And you can only cash in on the wish when you see a lone cloud in an otherwise clear sky . ”
119112	119127	119128	119128	he	196	“ I know what I ’ll ch - ch - choose , Auntie Persy , ”
119133	119147	119128	119128	he	196	“ I ’ll choose what I always choose . I ’ll choose you . ”
119218	119224	119225	119227	The young boy	157	“ What ’s going on ? ”
119230	119239	119240	119240	I	3485	“ I know what you did to Tinder , ”
119245	119256	119240	119240	I	3485	“ I need to talk to you two . Alone . ”
119269	119282	119283	119283	he	157	“ Tree , take your brother and go up to your room , ”
119313	119335	119336	119336	Joelle	3223	“ Save it . I know about the ruler . About the beatings . How you pushed Joelle from the railings . ”
119358	119364	119365	119365	I	3485	“ I know about Cillian , ”
119411	119416	119402	119402	Andrew	157	“ He told you ? ”
119437	119570	119402	119402	Andrew	157	“ Your secret is becoming not so secretive . Does n’t bode well for your role as the chairman of Green Living . At any rate , I ’m here to tell you that was the last time you hit your son . I am taking this to Child Protective Services . Since it ’s not my first rodeo with CPS , let me tell you how it ’s going to play out . I will file a complaint , they ’ll visit your house within twenty - four hours to check for the wellness of your children , and once they find signs of neglect or abuse — which they will , because Tinder is physically injured — they’ll remove the children to a foster home and press charges against you . ”
119575	119618	119619	119619	I	3485	“ Since I ’ve worked with numerous schools during my short career and know quite a few CPS agents , I can probably help Joelle get full custody since she was n’t complicit in the abuse . Now , as for you — ”
119650	119662	119619	119619	I	3485	“ You should put your children above all else . Always . ”
119663	119667	119668	119668	Joelle	3223	“ I did . ”
119680	119724	119668	119668	Joelle	3223	“ I do ! Do you think I liked what he did ? Do you think it ’s my fault ? I had no idea it was going to be this way . I would have never married him , Persy . Ever . ”
119794	119865	119788	119788	he	2357	“ Does n’t matter what you thought . It ’s time you take responsibility and step away from this toxic relationship . Put you and the twins first . Consider this my official resignation . Oh , and Andrew ? Drop the lawsuit against my husband . You ’ll either have to resign or get fired within the next few days , and you have bigger legal fish to fry . ”
119951	119957	119958	119958	I	3485	“ Come here , boys . ”
120224	120231	120237	120237	she	3119	“ Your father ca n’t know . ”
120385	120394	120395	120395	Mother	3119	“ Cillian Frances , did you hear me ? ”
120410	120415	120416	120416	I	3485	“ Loud and clear . ”
120426	120429	120430	120430	She	3119	“ Good . ”
120441	120468	120430	120430	She	3119	“ He will blame it on me , somehow . He always does , you know ? I can never catch a break with this man . ”
120573	120580	120559	120559	she	3119	“ Your father never holds him . ”
120616	120634	120614	120614	him	3168	“ Buckle up , little bro . You were definitely born into one heck of a family . ”
120635	120638	120639	120639	Mother	3119	“ Anyway , ”
120651	120676	120639	120639	Mother	3119	“ I hope this has nothing to do with Andrew Arrowsmith . You wo n’t be seeing much of him anymore outside of Evon . ”
120677	120691	120692	120692	I	3485	“ I have n’t heard or seen him since Athair fired his dad , ”
120705	120720	120721	120721	Mother	3119	“ His father would n’t have been fired if he was n’t a crook , ”
120724	120733	120639	120639	Mother	3119	“ I do n’t care about his father . ”
120734	120746	120747	120747	she	3119	“ We ’ll see if he finishes his studies at Evon , ”
120766	120777	120754	120754	I	3485	“ Your father is suing him for everything he stole . ”
120778	120798	120799	120799	I	3485	“ They used to go golfing together . Take annual vacations . Visit casinos in Europe . Go fishing , ”
120832	120858	120827	120827	She	3119	“ Do n’t be naïve , Cillian . People will do anything to get close to us Fitzpatricks . We ca n’t have real friendships . ”
120891	120896	120897	120897	she	3119	“ I would stay , ”
120900	120935	120936	120936	She	3119	“ but you know how jittery I get in clinics . They ’re not my scene . Besides , I have some shopping to do . You understand , do n’t you , Kill ? ”
121021	121027	120999	120999	They	2625	“ Hi there , Cillian . ”
121028	121031	120999	120999	They	2625	“ Hello . ”
121066	121072	121096	121097	the doctor	2629	“ How ’re you feeling ? ”
121073	121080	121081	121081	I	3485	“ Been better . Been worse . ”
121090	121095	121096	121097	the doctor	2629	“ That ’s interesting , ”
121133	121142	121096	121097	the doctor	2629	“ Do you know why you ’re here ? ”
121148	121165	121166	121166	I	3485	“ I ’m guessing it ’s because I have a thing called the Tourette ’s syndrome . ”
121198	121205	121166	121166	I	3485	“ How long have you known ? ”
121206	121211	121166	121166	I	3485	“ About a week . ”
121240	121258	121263	121267	A middle - aged female	2632	“ How can it be ? It says here your tic attack took place two days ago , ”
121291	121294	121295	121295	I	3485	“ Yes , ”
121308	121332	121295	121295	I	3485	“ But I ’ve been feeling the tension of the attack in the days before building up , so I did some research . ”
121333	121344	121345	121348	the woman Swiss doctor	2637	“ So you knew you were going to get it ? ”
121352	121356	121345	121348	the woman Swiss doctor	2637	“ The attack . ”
121368	121372	121373	121373	she	2632	“ Poor thing , ”
121383	121392	121393	121393	I	3485	“ Never been accused of being that before , ”
121403	121409	121410	121412	the female doctor	2637	“ Where are your parents ? ”
121442	121469	121439	121440	my favorite	2639	“ My father is in Boston , handling the family business , and my mother is shopping . Zurich is one of her favorite retail spots . ”
121502	121510	121511	121513	the male doctor	2629	“ Why did n’t you tell anyone ? ”
121516	121523	121511	121513	the male doctor	2629	“ About the Tourette ’s syndrome . ”
121524	121530	121531	121531	I	3485	“ What was the point ? ”
121539	121582	121531	121531	I	3485	“ Knowing my family , we will be keeping my condition under wraps . So either you prescribe me with shit , try new treatment on me , or let me go . I ’ll figure out a way to hide it . ”
121583	121590	121591	121593	the female doctor	2629	“ It ’s a neurological disorder , ”
121602	121695	121591	121593	the female doctor	2629	“ Caused by an array of very complex things , mostly because of abnormalities in certain brain regions . The tics will come and go , and even though we can offer some treatments to relieve and ease the disorder , it is mostly here to stay . You ca n’t control it . The very definition of Tourette ’s is that your tics are involuntarily . You can not train your nerves . They are everywhere in your body . To numb them , you will have to stop feeling completely . ”
121698	121704	121705	121705	I	3485	“ Then it is voluntary . ”
121713	121716	121717	121718	the doctor	2629	“ No , ”
121721	121743	121717	121718	the doctor	2629	“ For you to stop the tics , you ’ll have to stop feeling . I do n’t think you understand — ”
121744	121749	121750	121750	I	3485	“ I understand everything . ”
121771	121775	121717	121718	the doctor	2629	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick — ”
122459	122466	122456	122456	He	205	“ What the fuck , Arrowsmith ? ”
122467	122497	122456	122456	He	205	“ The fuck is your father is a jealous asshole , and my mates here told me that you ’re a freak . I heard about the library accident . ”
122543	122575	122576	122576	I	3485	“ Yeah ? Well , I h - h - heard your da - da - dad stole money to pay your way through Evon . Short on money , Arrowsmith ? ”
122608	122618	122589	122589	Andrew	157	“ Oh , man , you ’re stuttering now ! ”
122619	122625	122626	122626	I	3485	“ I ’m not stuttering . ”
122691	122694	122698	122698	he	157	“ The good thing”—Andrew
122702	122733	122698	122698	he	157	me—“is that I ’m not a Fitzpatrick . An Arrowsmith always comes to his friend ’s rescue . And you need to be rescued , do n’t you , Kill ? ”
122856	122874	122832	122832	Andrew	157	“ I ’m about to fuck your ugly face up even worse than you did , Fitzy . ”
122882	122892	122875	122875	I	3485	“ Give it your best shot , Oliver Twist . ”
123690	123698	123714	123716	my legal team	2687	“ Sir , you have a visitor . ”
123721	123729	123714	123716	my legal team	2687	“ Do you have eyes , Serena ? ”
123730	123733	123734	123734	she	2688	“ Sophia , ”
123745	123751	123734	123734	she	2688	“ I do , sir . ”
123752	123784	123714	123716	my legal team	2687	“ Then I suggest you make use of them and look at my planner . It is wide open for a reason . I do not accept visitors at this time . ”
123856	123862	123863	123863	She	772	“ It ’s your wife . ”
124039	124044	124045	124045	I	3485	“ Turn her away , ”
124055	124087	124088	124088	I	3485	“ I ’m afraid she ca n’t and wo n’t do that . Also , do n’t take that tone with her . She is your assistant , not your servant . ”
124134	124141	124142	124142	She	3223	“ You ’ve fired Ms. Brandt . ”
124154	124157	124142	124142	She	3223	“ Why ? ”
124158	124167	124168	124168	I	3485	“ That ’s not any of your business . ”
124173	124177	124178	124178	She	3223	“ Try again . ”
124186	124192	124193	124193	I	3485	“ Because you hated her , ”
124265	124287	124288	124288	I	3485	“ I suppose you ’re here because your ex - husband has dumped you again . Am I the consolation prize ? ”
124337	124345	124346	124346	Her	3223	“ You knew he was in town ? ”
124354	124359	124360	124360	I	3485	“ Your security cameras , ”
124385	124435	124379	124379	She	3223	“ I threw him out the night he showed up . You ’d have known that if you ’d bothered to answer any of my calls or actually go through the pain of giving me the time of the day when I tried to visit you at your house . ”
124492	124502	124503	124503	I	3485	“ Would you like a prize for remaining faithful ? ”
124567	124576	124577	124577	She	3223	“ Sam told you , did n’t he ? ”
124599	124606	124585	124585	She	3223	“ He is on my payroll . ”
124607	124616	124585	124585	She	3223	“ So is the rest of the city . ”
124617	124638	124585	124585	She	3223	“ You included , so do yourself a favor and stop sniffing around my business before I cut you off . ”
124639	124663	124585	124585	She	3223	“ We both know I ’m not here for the money . Now , I want to talk about what I ’ve learned . ”
124671	124674	124675	124675	I	3485	“ No , ”
124679	124685	124675	124675	I	3485	“ You had no right . ”
124686	124691	124692	124692	She	3223	“ Had no right ? ”
124696	124776	124692	124692	She	3223	“ I ’m your wife , Kill . Whether you accept it or not . I wanted to help you . That ’s why I decided to work for Andrew in the first place . To extract information . To get a glimpse into his most intimate place . I knew there was too much riding on this operation , and that you ’d try to stop me because you ’re too righteous to accept you needed my help . ”
124777	124786	124664	124664	She	3223	“ Your job is not to save me . ”
124787	124790	124791	124791	She	3223	“ Why ? ”
124799	124898	124791	124791	She	3223	“ Why is n’t it my job to save you ? I ’ve lost count of the times you ’ve saved me . You saved me from Byrne and Kaminski , from a horse , from a poisonous flower , from my ex - husband . The list goes on and on . Why is it okay for you to give up your entire existence for the world , to put your father ’s needs before yours , to walk through fire for the people you care about , but I ca n’t do you this one solid ? ”
124899	124907	124908	124908	I	3485	“ Because you did n’t accomplish anything ! ”
124918	124962	124908	124908	I	3485	“ You pretty little idiot , the videos you found wo n’t hold up in court . They are not legal evidence . They ’re stolen , and probably fuzzy , and do n’t capture his face . You ’ve worked for nothing . ”
124993	125025	124986	124986	I	3485	“ Your little stunt did nothing more than put another ten - foot dent in our marriage , which , by the way , was the worst mistake of my life . ”
125134	125144	125145	125145	she	772	“ You do n’t know what I found out , ”
125149	125156	125145	125145	she	772	“ I do n’t fucking care ! ”
125235	125313	125217	125217	I	3485	“ Nothing you found on Andrew ’s laptop can help me win this case . The only thing you did was give him more ammo on me . Now he is probably telling people I sent my wife to sniff around his work and made her perform two jobs to try to dig up some dirt about him . Not only did you not help me , but you also put yourself at risk , and I … ”
125355	125362	125363	125363	she	3162	“ And you what , hubs ? ”
125367	125379	125363	125363	she	3162	“ What would have happened had Andrew done something to me ? ”
125509	125554	125489	125489	I	3485	“ And I wish he ’d finished the job , Flower Girl , so I could finally go ahead and marry someone in my own league . You were a mistake . A foolish , horny mistake . Divorce could n’t come fast enough . ”
125611	125688	125689	125689	She	772	“ In that case , congratulations . You ’ve worked really hard to show me Andrew turned you into a heartless monster . Consider yourself free from this marriage . Here ’s your parting gift from me . A Child Protective Service report deeming Andrew a dangerous , unfit father . Thought it might be of interest to you , since he ’s lost custody of his children , and will be losing his job next . ”
125701	125898	125689	125689	She	772	“ I love you , Cillian Fitzpatrick . I ’ve always loved you . From the moment we first met at the charity ball when I spotted you across the room . You were a god among mortals . Vital yet dead . And when you looked at me — when you looked past me — I saw my whole future in your eyes . I knew you were rich , and handsome , and powerful . Yet the only thing I truly ever wanted from you , Kill , was you . To peel off the layers , shed them with my fingernails , and have you , and love you , and save you . I thought I could change you . And I tried . I really did . But I can not change someone who does n’t want to change . I love you , but I love me , too . And I deserve more than you ’ve given me . More than you are willing to part ways with . So I ’m saving you this one time , for all the times you saved me , and saying goodbye . ”
125922	126038	125899	125899	She	2716	“ We ’ve always been so bad at respecting each other ’s boundaries . We broke our contract again and again and again . If you have a shred of sympathy for me in that cold heart of yours , do n’t contact me anymore . No matter what happens , no matter how much you want to tell me something , leave me alone . I need time to digest , to lick my wounds , to move on . Do n’t show up at my sister ’s house , or at my workplace , or anywhere I might be . Let me get over you . My heart ca n’t take another blow . ”
126450	126457	126458	126458	Hunter	489	“ Kill ? Are you there ? ”
126476	126479	126480	126480	I	3485	“ No , ”
126511	126522	126492	126492	He	760	“ Sailor had the baby . I have a daughter . ”
126570	126573	126574	126574	I	3485	“ Congratulations , ”
126578	126586	126574	126574	I	3485	“ Are the mother and daughter healthy ? ”
126587	126590	126574	126574	I	3485	“ Very . ”
126591	126612	126574	126574	I	3485	“ Good . I opened a trust fund in your child ’s honor . Three grand a month until college . ”
126613	126625	126626	126626	He	760	“ Thanks , but that ’s not why I ’m here . ”
126638	126668	126626	126626	He	760	“ Sam found out Andrew put Paxton Veitch on the plane back to Boston . That ’s how he got here . Arrowsmith was obviously trying to stir shit . ”
126742	126746	126747	126747	I	3485	“ I know , ”
126750	126776	126747	126747	I	3485	“ I got it out of Paxton myself . Apparently , I ’m the only son of a bitch around qualified to get shit done . ”
126777	126781	126782	126782	Hunter	489	“ Doubt it . ”
126785	126788	126747	126747	I	3485	“ Why ? ”
126789	126804	126747	126747	I	3485	“ Because you ’re currently trying to loosen the bottom of a liquor bottle . ”
126887	126896	126897	126897	I	3485	“ I took care of the Arrowsmith problem , ”
126901	126908	126897	126897	I	3485	“ Well , my wife did . ”
126909	126920	126885	126885	him	760	“ That ’s not why I ’m here , either . ”
126921	126927	126928	126928	I	3485	“ Why are you here ? ”
126931	126938	126928	126928	I	3485	“ Go be with your family . ”
126982	126989	126990	126990	He	489	“ I am with my family . ”
127005	127046	126990	126990	He	489	“ With the family who needs me right now . And I ’d very much like to go back to the one I ’ve just created , so would you tell me what the fuck is going on with you ? ”
127097	127103	127104	127104	I	3485	“ She saved my ass , ”
127121	127159	127104	127104	I	3485	“ Tutoring that asshole ’s kids . Digging up dirt on him . She did it for me . All this time , I thought she was just getting back at me for being cruel to her . ”
127160	127164	127165	127165	he	760	“ You cursed , ”
127192	127197	127186	127186	Tourette	421	“ that cursing disorder , ”
127288	127296	127297	127297	he	760	“ Persy ’s in love with you , ”
127304	127315	127316	127317	Many women	2753	“ She ’s in love with the idea of me . ”
127320	127393	127316	127317	Many women	2753	“ What it comes down to is this , ceann beag . She is , and always will be , a woman I ’d bought like a sack of potatoes . She came with a price tag , like all the women before her . And if you can buy it , you can replace it . I ’ll find someone else . And Persephone ? She ’ll marry again , too . ”
127459	127464	127451	127452	My brother	760	“ What the f — ”
127465	127469	127470	127470	He	760	“ You asswipe ! ”
127529	127533	127534	127534	I	3485	“ Stop it , ”
127575	127587	127588	127588	Hunter	489	“ She was never in love with your persona , assface . ”
127636	127664	127665	127665	He	489	“ Stalin had a more loveable character , you moron . She was always stupidly — and may I add unreasonably — in love with your ass ! ”
127679	127687	127688	127688	I	3485	“ She owed a lot of money , ”
127692	127705	127688	127688	I	3485	“ I paid her debt . That ’s why she married me . ”
127706	127710	127711	127711	Hunter	489	“ I know ! ”
127742	127826	127723	127723	He	489	“ I know , because after the night Persy came to accept your offer in the blizzard , I knocked on her door . I knew I had to make it right . Not for her , or for you , but for my wife . I did n’t want anything to upset Sailor so early in the pregnancy . Persy told me about her debt . I offered to pay it in full and wrote a check right in front of her . ”
127850	127856	127857	127857	I	3485	“ You wrote a check ? ”
127860	127867	127857	127857	I	3485	“ Does n’t your generation Venmo ? ”
127881	127942	127868	127868	He	2761	“ She tore the bitch up in front of my face and told me she was marrying your sorry ass . She wanted to marry you ! Stipulations and assholery included . Now my question is this — how did you manage to lose her ? How did you let the only girl you ’ve ever loved just … go ? ”
127943	127948	127875	127875	his	2761	“ I do n’t — ”
127949	127955	127956	127956	He	2761	“ Of course you do ! ”
127989	128096	128097	128097	He	2763	“ You fool , anyone with a pair of working eyes could see you ’re crazy about her . You could n’t look Persephone in the eye like a six - year - old for as long as you ’ve known her . You could n’t bring yourself to attend her goddamn wedding . You ’ve had it bad for her from the moment you saw her . You let her go because of your stupid insecurities . Because you are so convinced you ’re Hades , doomed , dark , and unredeemable , you have n’t even bothered to read the myth all the way . ”
128116	128119	128120	128120	He	2763	“ Persephone ! ”
128124	128127	128128	128128	He	2763	“ Loved ! ”
128135	128138	128128	128128	He	2763	“ Hades ! ”
128139	128152	128153	128153	I	3485	“ I do n’t l - l - l - love her . ”
128175	128180	128181	128181	he	2763	“ Say it louder , ”
128184	128198	128199	128199	I	3485	“ I do n’t lo - lo - lo dammit ! Love her ! ”
128209	128212	128206	128206	his	2763	“ Louder . ”
128213	128219	128220	128220	I	3485	“ Are you an idiot ? ”
128254	128262	128244	128248	A cum - stuffed one	2765	“ I do n’t love my wife . ”
128378	128381	128382	128382	I	3485	“ Apologize , ”
128394	128446	128382	128382	I	3485	“ Siblings do n’t apologize . They just start acting nice to each other . Now , you ai n’t driving anywhere after polishing off a bottle of vodka . Get your ass in my car . I ’m throwing you in the shower and taking you to see your niece . ”
128471	128524	128525	128525	He	489	“ Save it , bro . I do n’t care . And if you ’re worried about seeing your estranged wife at the hospital , do n’t . By the time we get there , she ’ll be at work . You did n’t even ask what my daughter ’s name was . ”
128536	128541	128525	128525	He	489	“ What is it ? ”
128567	128570	128591	128591	She	2773	“ Rooney . ”
128802	128820	128821	128821	He	157	“ Moving so fast , Arrowsmith ? We have n’t even had a chance to have brunch . ”
128832	128855	128856	128856	He	157	“ I ’m handing in my resignation tomorrow . I took some time off to move out , as you can see . ”
128870	128881	128882	128882	I	3485	“ Does n’t work for me , I ’m afraid , ”
128892	128935	128882	128882	I	3485	“ You ’ll hand in your resignation by the end of the workday and drop the lawsuit by three o’clock . If not , I will sue you for every single penny I ’ve spent in legal fees since this bullshit started . ”
128988	128991	128992	128992	he	157	“ Why ? ”
129004	129029	128992	128992	he	157	“ Why would I do things your way ? All your nasty wife has on me is a bad report from a social worker . ”
129047	129065	128992	128992	he	157	“ Your mouth is not worthy of referring to my wife , let alone calling her nasty . ”
129122	129183	129107	129107	Andrew	157	“ As for your question — it is more than a report , and we both know it . You are abusing a child with a disorder . Your own child . And let ’s not forget the battery charge for what you did to your wife . That ’s not very charitable , now , is it , Andy ? ”
129235	129243	129244	129244	He	157	“ I wasn’t … I did n’t … ”
129266	129309	129244	129244	He	157	“ I love Tinder . I just did n’t know why me . Why did it happen to my child ? How was it fair that I had to raise a child as screwed up as the man I hated the most — ”
129312	129328	129310	129310	Me	3485	“ My only sin was being the son of the man who hurt your family . ”
129335	129429	129310	129310	Me	3485	“ Well , hating him was futile , was n’t it ? He had a good reason to do what he did to my dad . Plus , it was n’t like I had any access to him . You represented the Fitzpatricks . You were the person I ’d seen day in and day out . I felt betrayed and played . Our paths , that had always been parallel , were now forking in different directions . I felt deprived . Robbed of opportunity and prospects and a future I deserved . ”
129441	129457	129430	129430	He	157	“ I used to toss and turn in bed hoping the Fitzpatricks would adopt me . ”
129463	129498	129430	129430	He	157	“ My wish — my fantasy — was to be you . And when I found out you were less than golden , less than mo òrga , I used it to my advantage . ”
129535	129552	129553	129553	Andrew	157	“ You and I , we were in the business of pain . But with Tinder … ”
129558	129617	129553	129553	Andrew	157	“ I never realized I was hurting him . I thought I was helping him . Your wife said she will make this go away if I attend therapy three times a week and live in a different house . I gave Joelle full custody yesterday morning . I can only see my own children while supervised now . ”
129661	129671	129672	129672	I	3485	“ You have until the end of the day , ”
129718	129739	129747	129747	he	2794	“ Drop the lawsuit and resign , then write an extensive press release kissing my ass and admitting your wrongdoings . ”
129756	129759	129760	129760	Andrew	157	“ Cillian , ”
129771	129778	129779	129779	he	2794	“ How ’d you do it ? ”
129782	129789	129779	129779	he	2794	“ Teach yourself to feel again . ”
129854	129859	129860	129860	I	3485	“ I did n’t , ”
129863	129868	129860	129860	I	3485	“ She taught me . ”
130021	130030	130031	130031	Belle	485	“ This came in the mail for you . ”
130116	130143	130144	130144	Belle	485	“ Do n’t forget , we promised to visit Sailor at five . Let me know if you want me to pick you up from work . ”
130659	130664	130646	130646	Belle	485	“ Is it Kill ? ”
130665	130668	130669	130669	I	3485	“ Yeah . ”
130687	130692	130693	130693	She	1931	“ Do n’t answer . ”
130698	130713	130693	130693	She	1931	“ He needs to sweat a little . See that you have a backbone . ”
130868	130876	130877	130877	she	438	“ You sure you wanna do this ? ”
130902	130935	130891	130891	She	438	“ I mean , you wo n’t hear any complaints from me . I ’m getting my fee , but the Fitzpatricks are n’t a bad family to marry into , child . ”
130936	130941	130942	130942	I	3485	“ I ’m sure . ”
130957	130967	130942	130942	I	3485	“ Can you send it to him , please ? ”
130973	131004	130968	130968	She	438	“ Sorry . Your spouse must be served in person . And it has to be by a sheriff , who will then give you proof via return of service . ”
131050	131056	131070	131070	Cillian	142	“ Is it really necessary ? ”
131144	131147	131149	131150	the lawyer	2825	“ Yes , ”
131160	131192	131149	131150	the lawyer	2825	“ Maybe you should talk to him if you ’re so unsure . If you ’re going to divorce a man , at least give him the courtesy of expecting it . ”
131200	131207	131193	131193	I	3485	“ I ’ll let him know . ”
131234	131243	131244	131245	Ms. Gwen	442	“ Can I turn on the local news ? ”
131379	131385	131386	131387	Ms. Hazel	443	“ What are we watching ? ”
131406	131415	131391	131392	Ms. Gwen	442	“ Wait , is that a press conference ? ”
131416	131420	131421	131422	Ms. Michelle	444	“ Breaking news . ”
131514	131529	131530	131531	Ms. Michelle	444	“ Hey , Pers , what ’s your hot guy doing on the news ? ”
131534	131549	131550	131551	Ms. Gwen	442	“ Breaking her poor colleagues ’ hearts , that ’s what he ’s doing . ”
131554	131580	131550	131551	Ms. Gwen	442	“ Emphasis on the word poor . What ’re you still doing here , Persy ? Did you not get the memo you ’re loaded ? ”
131581	131589	131591	131592	Ms. Regina	445	“ Why , hello there , honey , ”
131606	131619	131602	131602	Cillian	142	“ You can ruin my natural resources any day of the week . ”
131620	131652	131591	131592	Ms. Regina	445	“ Ladies and gentlemen , thank you so much for coming here today . As I mentioned , this statement will be brief , and , like my temper , short . ”
131781	131840	131842	131842	his	600	“ Despite proving to be a great financial resource and revealing strong potential in getting our hands on more oil , Royal Pipelines has decided to stop the Arctic exploration drillings immediately and indefinitely . All the scheduled rigs will be shut down , future plans are shelved , and the current running trials will cease to operate as of”—he
131851	131857	131842	131842	his	600	frown—“exactly fifteen minutes from now . ”
131926	132001	131914	131914	Kill	3067	“ As I said , the statement will be brief , and I will not be taking any questions . In addition to stopping all oil - rig actions , as of this afternoon , I am also the proud owner of the surrounding Arctic areas which have shown potential and promise to discover oil , meaning Royal Pipelines currently holds all the reserves and options for anyone to drill in the Arctic . Ever .
132002	132059	131914	131914	Kill	3067	“ I will explore cleaner options in my bid to grow Royal Pipelines ’ capital and am still committed to employ tens of thousands of Americans . In fact , I would like to inform our investors that I already got my hands on something far more lucrative than the Arctic and not nearly as destructive . ”
132103	132160	131914	131914	Kill	3067	“ The reason for my executive decision has nothing to do with Green Living . As you ’re aware , Green Living had decided to drop the case against Royal Pipelines . As of today , no one had managed to pick it up and carry it through . The reason for my decision is entirely personal .
132161	132213	132214	132214	He	142	“ As some of you know , I married less than a year ago . One of the things my wife taught me was to listen . This is me listening to what she had to say . She ’s been outspoken against drilling in the Arctic throughout our short marriage . ”
132222	132231	132214	132214	He	142	“ She drives a Tesla , you see . ”
132383	132406	132407	132407	Hunter	489	“ Anyone interested in hearing a joke about that time Kill drilled the Arctic but stopped because someone thawed his icy heart ? ”
132423	132426	132427	132427	Devon	177	“ No , ”
132437	132444	132434	132434	Hunter	489	“ ’ Kay . Good talk . ”
132726	132732	132704	132704	I	3485	“ You little piece of — ”
132733	132745	132746	132746	I	3485	“ I would not finish that sentence if I were you . ”
132760	132785	132746	132746	I	3485	“ You ’re talking to the CEO of Royal Pipelines . Disrespect me , and you ’ll find yourself escorted out of my building . ”
132786	132790	132791	132791	he	3485	“ Your building ? ”
132794	132807	132791	132791	he	3485	“ That ’s a good one . No . You would never , ”
132853	132859	132835	132835	He	3485	“ I do n’t understand . ”
132860	132872	132873	132873	I	3485	“ I am under no obligation to make sense to you , ”
132877	132940	132835	132835	He	3485	“ Green Living dropped the lawsuit . This could ’ve been the most lucrative oil - rig operation in the world . I mean , you were the one who pushed for it . You were the head of research . You spent three goddamn months living on an iceberg , managing this project closely . This was your baby , Cillian . ”
132941	132944	132945	132945	I	3485	“ Yes , ”
132948	132979	132945	132945	I	3485	“ And now I ’m interested in another baby . A human one . Which is why I ’d like my wife to be as content as she can be . ”
132980	132988	132989	132989	Mother	3119	“ This is what it ’s about ? ”
133004	133049	132989	132989	Mother	3119	“ Sweetie , we appreciate you marrying this … this sweet , common girl , but there are others out there . Just as pretty , and they wo n’t interfere with your business . I did n’t interfere with your father ’s business . ”
133050	133053	133054	133054	I	3485	“ No , ”
133057	133150	133054	133054	I	3485	“ You also had jack - shit to say about anything , from our upbringing to our education . At the risk of sounding disrespectful — which , by the way , I am happy to take — I do n’t want your kind of marriage . It looks awful , inside and out . I do n’t want manageable . I do n’t want my wife to be a ghost of a mother . A yes woman . A prop . And I like my common wife just fine , Mother . ”
133173	133184	133185	133186	my father	743	“ This beats the entire purpose of you getting married ! ”
133194	133209	133185	133186	my father	743	“ Losing this 1.4 - billion - dollar opportunity for a … for a … ”
133210	133214	133215	133215	I	3485	“ Say it . ”
133218	133242	133215	133215	I	3485	“ For pussy , right ? No other organ in a woman ’s body counts for you . Least of all a heart . ”
133255	133258	133259	133260	my father	743	“ Yes ! ”
133283	133302	133270	133270	his	743	“ If I knew that was the case , I ’d have never pushed you to get married . ”
133303	133310	133311	133311	I	3485	“ I ’m glad you did . ”
133317	133412	133311	133311	I	3485	“ This marriage has taught me an important lesson . A lesson Evon , Yale , and Harvard combined could n’t . Now , allow me to apply some of the conclusions I ’ve come to in recent months and throw you the hell out of my office — yes , my office , if I put in the sixty hour work week , I ’m the one calling the shots — with this tip : never , ever tell me what to do with my job , my life , and my marriage . ”
133432	133448	133311	133311	I	3485	“ Go on . You know how to use your legs , do n’t you ? ”
133517	133522	133523	133523	she	3119	“ I ’m sorry , ”
133536	133560	133523	133523	she	3119	“ I ’m sorry for everything . You are right . You deserve better than what we made of our lives , Cillian . ”
133566	133570	133561	133561	I	3485	“ All forgiven . ”
133571	133574	133534	133534	her	3119	“ Really ? ”
133582	133587	133575	133575	I	3485	“ Now get out . ”
133613	133617	133618	133618	He	3225	“ Mo òrga . ”
133623	133676	133677	133677	He	3225	“ You keep surprising me with your strength . Your brother has always been a wild card but simple to crack . That ’s why I unleashed the Brennan girl on him . Your sister … well , she is a saint I do n’t have to worry about , but you . ”
133684	133714	133715	133715	he	3225	“ You were my damaged child , which made you so much more dangerous because we both knew you could survive anything . You think I do n’t know , ”
133735	133775	133729	133729	he	3225	physically—“but I do . I know about your demons , Cillian . The same ones live in the basement of my heart . Only difference is , you seemed to have slayed yours . Good for you , son . ”
133791	133795	133796	133796	Sophia	772	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick ! ”
133816	133822	133796	133796	Sophia	772	“ You have a visitor . ”
133823	133826	133796	133796	Sophia	772	“ Who ? ”
133827	133831	133796	133796	Sophia	772	“ Ms. Penrose . ”
133832	133852	133796	133796	Sophia	772	“ Call her that one more time and you are permanently blacklisted from working at any respectable Boston company . ”
133927	133934	133935	133935	I	3485	“ Never mind . Wrong sister . ”
133968	133977	133978	133978	Emmabelle	3320	“ Cillian ! How ’s life treating you ? ”
133987	134003	134004	134004	I	3485	“ Like I fucked its underage daughter , and now it ’s out for revenge , ”
134052	134058	134059	134059	I	3485	“ Feet off the table , ”
134062	134069	134059	134059	I	3485	“ Unless you want them broken . ”
134070	134081	134082	134082	She	772	“ Oh , dear , someone ’s in a mood . ”
134126	134140	134114	134114	I	3485	“ I ’m afraid things are about to go from bad to worse . ”
134141	134151	134152	134152	I	3485	“ I sincerely doubt there ’s room for deterioration , ”
134156	134172	134173	134173	She	772	“ Then I ’m here to prove you the sky is the limit , baby . ”
134197	134203	134192	134192	her	772	“ You ’ve been served . ”
134278	134284	134285	134285	I	3485	“ The answer is no , ”
134296	134328	134285	134285	I	3485	“ I told Persephone divorce was n’t an option . It is tacky , brings bad press , and besides , she ’s yet to fulfill her part of the bargain . ”
134329	134339	134340	134340	Emmabelle	3320	“ You realize you ’re not God , right ? ”
134346	134361	134340	134340	Emmabelle	3320	“ You ca n’t just snap your fingers and make people fall in line . ”
134367	134371	134362	134362	I	3485	“ Prove it . ”
134372	134380	134285	134285	I	3485	“ She does n’t want you anymore . ”
134381	134388	134362	134362	I	3485	“ I can change her mind . ”
134389	134396	134397	134397	Belle	485	“ What makes you think that ? ”
134404	134519	134362	134362	I	3485	“ She wanted me before I even tried . Now that I intend to make an effort , she wo n’t be able to resist me . Either way , we both know you ’re walking out of here with the divorce petition if I have to fucking feed it to you . This has no legal ground . You ’re not the sheriff , and I ’m not a guy you can push around . If it comes to court , I ’ll ask the judge for couple ’s therapy — and will receive it — seeing as we ’ve been married for a short period and no adultery or abuse has occurred . ”
134520	134527	134528	134528	Emmabelle	3320	“ That ’s what I thought . ”
134545	134619	134528	134528	Emmabelle	3320	“ Look , I ’m not your biggest fan for numerous reasons . At the top of them is the fact you planned to lock my baby sister in a suburban McMansion and have her produce heirs for you while you stayed here and lived the big life . But I ’ve come to accept that , despite your sociopathic shortcomings , you ’ve truly grown to love her . Am I right ? ”
134660	134663	134664	134664	I	3485	“ Yes , ”
134668	134676	134664	134664	I	3485	“ I love your sister very much . ”
134684	134698	134699	134699	Belle	485	“ Well , maybe it ’s time to tell her how you feel . ”
134712	134764	134699	134699	Belle	485	“ You ’ve been apologizing for the wrong thing the entire time . Persephone did n’t leave you because you ’re an asshole . Heck , I ’m sure it ’s half of your charm . She left you because she thinks you ’re incapable of feeling . Prove her wrong . ”
134765	134784	134867	134868	My sister	485	“ How the hell can I do that , seeing as I ’m not supposed to see her ? ”
134785	134789	134790	134790	She	485	“ Says who ? ”
134795	134799	134800	134800	I	3485	“ Says her , ”
134803	134813	134800	134800	I	3485	“ She told me not to come after her . ”
134814	134847	134867	134868	My sister	485	“ Since when do you listen to what my sister says ? One of the very things she loves about you is that you do whatever the hell you want . Always . ”
134882	134911	134877	134877	she	485	“ Go get her . She ’s waiting , and I ’m growing tired of taking my flings back to their apartments because she ’s in my bed . ”
134921	134930	134931	134931	Dahlia	209	“ There ’s a cloud in our backyard ! ”
134950	134953	134954	134954	Reid	208	“ Whoa ! ”
134969	134978	134954	134954	Reid	208	“ That is one giant , humongous cloud . ”
134979	134984	134985	134985	I	3485	“ Now , friends , ”
135014	135047	134998	134998	They	1993	“ Crisscross applesauce . Everybody sit down and pay attention to the story . We need to finish reading about Paddington attending the Busy Bee Adventure Trail before we can play outside . ”
135048	135068	135069	135069	Noah	454	“ Collecting B - words is b - o - r - r - i - n - g ! ”
135084	135109	135069	135069	Noah	454	“ Mommy says teachers are not very smart , or they would n’t be teachers . I want to play with the giant cloud ! ”
135121	135124	135125	135125	Dahlia	209	“ Please ! ”
135128	135134	135135	135135	Reid	208	“ Oh , Ms. Persy ! ”
135154	135186	135138	135139	The kids	1152	“ Please , please , please can we play with the cloud ? The nice man wants us to join him so badly . Look at him playing all by himself . ”
135436	135445	135446	135446	I	3485	“ I told you not to come here . ”
135450	135461	135462	135462	he	600	“ I told you a lot of things I regret , ”
135465	135477	135462	135462	he	600	“ I hope maybe what you said was one of yours . ”
135478	135496	135497	135497	My	3485	“ I ’ve already used my Cloud Wish , Kill . I ca n’t have another one . ”
135501	135513	135514	135514	He	600	“ The wish is not for you to make , Persephone . ”
135517	135523	135514	135514	He	600	“ It ’s for me . ”
135669	135675	135676	135676	He	600	“ This one is Dahlia . ”
135697	135715	135716	135716	he	600	“ You call her The Little Mouse . Sassy , sweet , stubborn . This is Teo , ”
135725	135737	135738	135738	he	600	“ shy and reserved but observant . And that ’s Joe , ”
135761	135767	135768	135768	I	3485	“ How did you know ? ”
135771	135780	135781	135781	he	600	“ I ’ve been listening during our dinners , ”
135784	135797	135781	135781	he	600	“ To every word you said . Even if I pretended otherwise . ”
135802	135810	135811	135811	I	3485	“ You ’re claiming your Cloud Wish ? ”
135839	135842	135870	135870	his	600	“ Yes . ”
135843	135850	135870	135870	his	600	“ Who said you have one ? ”
135858	135862	135870	135870	his	600	“ Your aunt . ”
135884	135903	135878	135878	he	600	“ She said I have to be careful . That you only get one wish in a lifetime . ”
135943	135949	135950	135950	I	3485	“ What ’s your wish ? ”
135986	136013	136035	136035	he	2905	“ I want an hour with you . Sixty minutes of your time . That ’s all I ask . When are you getting off work ? ”
136014	136017	136018	136018	I	3485	“ Four , ”
136021	136026	136018	136018	I	3485	“ Same as always . ”
136027	136032	136035	136035	he	2905	“ I ’ll wait . ”
136046	136054	136055	136055	I	3485	“ How did you make a cloud ? ”
136060	136070	136018	136018	I	3485	“ NASA has a manual . It ’s nothing . ”
136071	136076	136035	136035	he	2905	“ It ’s amazing . ”
136077	136084	136018	136018	I	3485	“ Third graders can do it . ”
136085	136091	136092	136092	I	3485	“ I do n’t care . ”
136097	136104	136105	136105	I	3485	“ Will you wait for me ? ”
136117	136139	136114	136114	He	2905	“ Persephone , my dear , I ’ve been waiting for eight years . Four more hours wo n’t kill me . ”
136252	136261	136262	136262	I	3485	“ You stopped the drilling in the Arctic . ”
136292	136295	136262	136262	I	3485	“ Yes . ”
136296	136302	136262	136262	I	3485	“ That was … nice . ”
136303	136333	136262	136262	I	3485	“ Giving you flowers is nice . Losing approximately 1.4 billion dollars a year in revenue is , at the very least , a romantic gesture of Shakespearean proportions . ”
136353	136365	136262	136262	I	3485	“ I ’m not even sure how many zeroes that entails . ”
136366	136369	136370	136370	His	142	“ Nine . ”
136394	136417	136377	136377	I	3485	“ Ten , including me , if my plan today does n’t work and I find out I did this for nothing . ”
136456	136464	136465	136465	I	3485	“ Should we go to your study ? ”
136485	136493	136480	136480	He	142	“ I want to show you something . ”
136706	136713	136714	136714	I	3485	“ What are we looking at ? ”
136794	136802	137061	137061	He	2923	“ How long have you had those ? ”
136803	136808	136809	136809	He	142	“ Almost four years . ”
136818	136961	136962	136962	he	2923	“ About a month after Hunter and Sailor ’s wedding , my landscaper called me outside , insisting I had to see this . He said it was peculiar . That he did n’t plant the bleeding heart , so he had no idea how the flower had gotten here . His best guess was seeds from a nearby garden blew in the wind and settled here . But I remembered that after I took the flowers from your hair , I put them in a napkin . Later that night , when I arrived home , I went out to the garden to smoke a cigar , found the napkin , and tossed it . It was just the one flower , and my landscaper asked if I wanted to keep it . I immediately thought about your curse — wish , ”
136965	137050	136962	136962	he	2923	“ and said no . He yanked the bleeding heart out from its root the same day . A month later , another bleeding heart grew in the same spot . I had him wrench it out again . This time he went as far as poisoning the soil . On the fourth time , I gave up . A part of me wanted to see how damn stubborn you were . And look at it now . My garden ’s full of them . ”
137084	137115	137061	137061	He	2923	“ So I lived with your bleeding heart . A poisonous reminder of how much I wanted you . Not much later , I found out you were getting married . ”
137116	137124	137125	137125	I	3485	“ You never answered my wedding invitation . ”
137133	137234	137061	137061	He	2923	“ Everyone has their limits . I draw mine at celebrating my idiocy of pushing you into another man ’s arms . Time went by . I ’d forgotten about you , mostly . The wheels of life kept on spinning , and no matter how fast or slow they went , I barely even remembered I was on board . Then Paxton left , I ’d been appointed CEO of Royal Pipelines , and you showed up at my office , looking for a favor . My initial reaction was to put as much space between us as possible . ”
137235	137243	137244	137244	I	3485	“ You did n’t want to feel , ”
137253	137309	137061	137061	He	2923	“ At this point , I was n’t even concerned about the possibility of feeling . I was mainly still annoyed about the damn flowers that kept showing up out of nowhere in my backyard . Like you snuck in at night and planted them there . But then the need for a bride arose … ”
137310	137332	137371	137380	A gorgeous , irresistible king who was misjudged and misunderstood	2926	“ Yes , and you had multiple candidates to choose from . You canceled the engagement to Minka Gomes . Why ? ”
137341	137347	137333	137333	He	3485	“ She was n’t you . ”
137348	137357	137061	137061	He	2923	“ She could ’ve been pregnant by now . ”
137358	137367	137368	137368	he	3485	“ It was never about having an heir , ”
137382	137399	137368	137368	he	3485	“ Deep down , I was n’t altruistic enough to give a fuck about the lineage . ”
137419	137427	137428	137428	I	3485	“ Tell me about the Tourette ’s , ”
137431	137460	137428	137428	I	3485	“ Everything , right from the beginning . I ’ve only seen a few videos , but they were enough to show me what you ’ve been through . ”
137461	137612	137400	137400	I	3485	“ It started with simple tics , right after my father fired Andrew Senior , and moved to full - blown attacks by the time I ’d gotten back to England after summer break . The lonelier I felt , the worse they became . I ’d been in and out of clinics , and on top of Tourette ’s , I also received comorbid diagnosis of having OCD and ASD . To me , it felt like the end of the world . People think of Tourette ’s as crazy people who shout out obscenities against their own will in rags on the street , OCD as compulsively obsessive maniacs who wash their hands fifteen times an hour , and ASD means I ’m on the autism spectrum . Which basically makes people think I ’m some sort of Rain Man . Good with numbers , dumb at everything else .
137613	137737	137783	137783	he	142	“ Quickly , I ’d realized I needed to rein in this condition if I wanted to become all the things I was born to be . I learned that while I could n’t control the tics , I could control what made them happen . And what made them happen was my being overwhelmed with emotion . Any type of emotion . Whether it was sadness , distress , anger , fear , or even joy . If I was excited — if my heart raced — the pressure of an attack usually followed . As long as I did n’t allow myself to feel , I kept the tics at bay . It was very simple and worked for everyone involved . ”
137854	137869	137834	137834	he	142	“ Everyone but you . You ’re the one who could n’t feel anything . ”
137870	137875	137834	137834	he	142	“ I survived fine . ”
137876	137882	137834	137834	he	142	“ Surviving is not enough . ”
137883	137889	137890	137890	His	142	“ I know that now . ”
137897	137902	137890	137890	His	142	“ Thanks to you . ”
137977	137986	137987	137987	he	142	“ Keep it here until I ’m done , ”
137995	138000	138001	138001	He	142	“ I want you . ”
138006	138045	138046	138046	He	142	“ I ’ve always wanted you with a hunger that made my chest ache and my mouth dry . That ’s one emotion . I am jealous and possessive of you . In case you have n’t noticed . ”
138055	138094	138095	138095	He	142	“ I worry and fear for you . When I discovered why you ’d decided to work for Andrew , I wanted to skin you alive for putting yourself at risk for me . That ’s two more . ”
138112	138137	138138	138138	He	142	“ Five emotions down , five more to go . You ’ve made me the happiest I ’ve ever been . Also the saddest . ”
138148	138160	138138	138138	He	142	“ And caused me an infinite amount of pain and pleasure . ”
138220	138227	138228	138228	he	142	“ I love you , Persephone , ”
138231	138288	138228	138228	he	142	“ I love you so fucking hard . Somewhere along the way , I softened . I may have saved you from a bleeding heart , but your bleeding heart saved me . Ten emotions are not twenty - seven . There ’s still more to go , but I want to take this journey with you .
138289	138335	138388	138388	He	3485	“ We are not Hades and Persephone , Flower Girl . Never were . I did n’t drag you down a dark path . You pulled me into the light . Helpless , I followed . Blindly , I got burned . I am Icarus . ”
138368	138387	138359	138359	I	3485	“ I love you as he loved the sun . Too close . Too hard . Too fast . ”
138555	138566	138544	138545	My husband	600	“ The contract still stands . My soul is yours . ”
138567	138574	138575	138575	I	3485	“ I never wanted your soul . ”
138586	138623	138575	138575	I	3485	“ I tore it to shreds the minute I got it in the mail . I ’ve only ever wanted your heart . Now that I have it , I have a secret to tell you . ”
138637	138649	138629	138629	I	3485	“ I did n’t believe in souls , either , before . ”
138650	138653	138624	138624	He	600	“ Before ? ”
138654	138660	138629	138629	I	3485	“ Before I met you . ”
138665	138675	138624	138624	He	600	“ You look like you ’re about to burst . ”
138857	138868	138869	138869	I	3485	“ When are the mood swings going to be over ? ”
138887	138914	138873	138873	Sailor	772	“ I ’m tired of bursting into tears every time I see a Super Bowl commercial and whenever a Katy Perry song comes on the radio . ”
138915	138924	138925	138925	Belle	485	“ You cry because she sucks , right ? ”
138938	138958	138925	138925	Belle	485	“ Just want to confirm your hormones are only messing with your feelings and not your taste in music . ”
138968	138973	138959	138959	I	3485	“ I ’m serious . ”
138974	138981	138982	138982	Sailor	772	“ My mood swings never passed , ”
138997	139037	138982	138982	Sailor	772	“ I remember pushing Rooney ’s stroller along a jogging trail , looking at a squirrel running about , thinking how its tail would be perfect for cleaning baby bottles . In my defense , it was really fluffy . ”
139038	139053	139054	139054	Belle	485	“ No offense , bitch , but you ’re not such a great example . ”
139074	139104	139054	139054	Belle	485	“ You got knocked up again before Rooney graduated from seeing shades to recognizing voices . Does your husband know he can put it away every now and again ? ”
139105	139108	139109	139109	we	2942	“ No , ”
139187	139199	139200	139200	Ash	120	“ Gross . It ’s my brother we ’re talking about . ”
139203	139243	139200	139200	Ash	120	“ Come to think of it , other than you , Belle , all my friends are also my sisters - in - law , and all of them got knocked up by my brothers . It ’s alarming . ”
139244	139256	139257	139257	I	3485	“ What ’s alarming is this baby is still inside me . ”
139264	139268	139269	139270	My husband	600	“ Lucky kid . ”
139344	139347	139348	139348	Belle	485	“ Satan , ”
139385	139388	139389	139389	Sailor	772	“ Lucifer , ”
139408	139411	139412	139412	Ash	120	“ Kill . ”
139443	139452	139468	139468	He	120	“ How ’re you doing , Flower Girl ? ”
139453	139458	139459	139459	I	3485	“ Tired . Sleepy . ”
139481	139487	139468	139468	He	120	“ And the little guy ? ”
139488	139512	139468	139468	He	120	“ Great . I think he ’s going to be a soccer player . He ’s been kicking up a storm all morning . ”
139518	139547	139513	139513	Cillian	142	“ Whatever floats his boat during adolescence . But once he ’s out of university , he ’s going to have to take his place at Royal Pipelines . ”
139572	139597	139550	139550	I	3485	“ We ’ve been through this , hubs . He is going to be whatever he wants to be . He is not you . ”
139699	139703	139704	139704	he	205	“ Of course , ”
139708	139727	139704	139704	he	205	“ He can be whatever he wants . A soccer player , a musician , a pool boy . ”
