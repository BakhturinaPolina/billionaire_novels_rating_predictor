2311	2314	2315	2315	Renny	90	“ Mommy ! ”
2324	2333	2315	2315	Renny	90	“ We need your luscious titties over here ! ”

2573	2579	2564	2565	The man	421	“ Can I come up ? ”
2694	2721	2676	2676	I	113	“ Renny , go put on a shirt ! Missy ? How much of this baby crap can we pick up in the next 15 seconds ? ”
2722	2733	2762	2763	Nate Kattenberger	1114	“ None of it ? I ’m nursing . Why ? ”
2798	2805	2808	2808	Nate	1114	“ You should be in bed . ”
2894	2897	2898	2898	I	113	“ Hey , ”
2905	2923	2898	2898	I	113	“ You rang my doorbell . I ca n’t open it and sleep at the same time . ”
2924	2938	2898	2898	I	113	“ A fair point , Bec . Were you sleeping before I rang ? ”
2984	2995	3002	3002	my	113	“ Jesus . I ’m still breathing , you know . ”
3042	3047	3048	3048	he	1114	“ Maybe I overshot , ”
3054	3062	3063	3063	He	1114	“ Here . You take this instead . ”
3082	3095	3063	3063	He	1114	“ Can I put the flowers on the table by the window ? ”
3096	3106	3063	3063	He	1114	“ If they fit ! Watch out for the … ”
3139	3147	3148	3149	my sister	360	“ I ’m so sorry about that , ”
3198	3201	3202	3202	I	113	“ Nate , ”
3213	3220	3202	3202	I	113	“ You remember my sister Missy . ”
3247	3256	3239	3239	I	113	“ And this is her boyfriend , Renny . ”
3257	3263	3264	3264	Nate	1114	“ How have you been ? ”
3284	3296	3278	3279	my sister	360	“ Are you here to look after Rebecca while she heals ? ”
3297	3304	3305	3305	Renny	90	“ Nope ! We live here , ”
3332	3335	3336	3336	I	113	“ Renny , ”
3339	3365	3336	3336	I	113	“ Did n’t you tell me you were going to make a trip to the store ? After the baby woke up , you said . ”
3394	3397	3398	3398	he	1114	“ Sure , ”
3404	3410	3398	3398	he	1114	“ I could do that . ”
3411	3418	3424	3424	her	360	“ I ’ll come with you , ”
3426	3445	3424	3424	her	360	“ We ’ll carry Matthew in the sling . He ’ll be done feeding in a minute here . ”
3458	3489	3449	3449	Renny	90	“ Hey , is the library open ? I finished that awesome book — with the parallel universe ? But it ended on a cliffy . I need the sequel . ”
3524	3531	3532	3532	He	1114	“ Parallel universes are the best ! ”
3542	3573	3532	3532	He	1114	“ Like , there ’s a parallel universe where I ’m the quarterback for the Giants . And there ’s a parallel universe where you ’re the Queen of France . ”
3574	3582	3583	3583	I	113	“ There ’s no monarchy in France , ”
3607	3614	3615	3615	Renny	90	“ But that ’s the point ! ”
3641	3658	3659	3659	He	449	“ Anything can happen in a parallel universe . My little man can fly . Whee ! ”
3671	3680	3681	3681	I	113	“ Wo n’t that make him spit up ? ”
3699	3739	3689	3689	Missy	91	“ Let ’s roll . Good to see you , Nate . Go easy on my sister . She spent the whole morning freaking out about missing work . But she ’s not supposed to touch a computer until … ”
3740	3743	3744	3744	I	113	“ Missy , ”
3747	3754	3757	3757	she	91	“ Well , you ’re not ! ”
3796	3804	3789	3789	he	449	“ Later , Nate Kattenberger and Becca ! ”
3836	3839	3840	3840	Nate	1114	“ Wow , ”
3843	3850	3851	3851	I	113	“ They ’re a little much , ”
3854	3857	3858	3858	He	449	“ No … ”
3872	3879	3858	3858	He	449	“ Your sofa is really quite … ”
3880	3883	3858	3858	He	449	“ Hideous ? ”
3887	3921	3922	3922	I	113	“ Would you believe that it ’s super comfortable , though ? Georgia and I thought about having it reupholstered , but we were n’t sure it would fit through the apartment door . ”
3929	3937	3922	3922	I	113	“ Sit . Try it for yourself . ”
3956	3961	3945	3945	He	1114	“ Yeah , okay . ”
3962	3985	3986	3986	Nate	1114	“ Not only is it comfortable , but when you ’re sitting on it you do n’t have to look at it . ”
4251	4257	4258	4258	he	1114	“ Are you really okay ? ”
4281	4284	4275	4275	him	1114	“ inscrutable . ”
4297	4303	4304	4304	I	113	“ I will be okay . ”
4309	4356	4304	4304	I	113	“ God , it was the stupidest fall ever . I do n’t think I even hit my head very hard . I ’ll go into the office tomorrow morning , okay ? I ’ll just take it easy at work for a day or two … ”
4364	4378	4357	4357	He	1114	“ No way . A concussion takes at least two weeks to heal . ”
4379	4383	4384	4384	I	113	“ Two weeks ! ”
4387	4405	4384	4384	I	113	“ But I do n’t need to play hockey , Nate . It ’s a desk job . ”
4406	4411	4412	4412	He	1114	“ Does n’t matter . ”
4430	4464	4425	4425	he	1114	“ For the next two weeks , Lauren is leaving her Manhattan seat to cover the Bruisers ’ office . Until you ’re really back on your feet . It ’s already decided . ”
4472	4479	4481	4481	Lauren	91	“ That ’s really not necessary . ”
4491	4498	4499	4499	She	91	“ Lauren hates hockey , anyway . ”
4547	4555	4540	4540	you	464	“ Lauren will just have to deal . ”
4556	4583	4522	4523	most men	462	“ Is there really no way I can talk you out of this ? I ’m just going to sit around this little apartment , bored . ”
4584	4618	4540	4540	you	464	“ You ’re benched , Bec . It happens . The players bitch about the downtime , too . We need your brain , okay ? We do n’t fool around with concussions . ”
4654	4663	4664	4664	My	113	“ Thank you for the flowers , Nate . ”
4880	4888	4889	4889	he	1114	“ Alternate universe theory is a thing , ”
4893	4898	4902	4902	I	113	“ Wh - what ? ”
4920	4935	4889	4889	he	1114	“ Alternate universes . The multiverse . It ’s a legitimate theory in physics . ”
4936	4945	4889	4889	he	1114	“ Pfft . Renny just reads science fiction . ”
4951	4982	4946	4946	Nate	1114	“ Because science fiction is awesome . The multiverse theory posits that infinity is large enough to simultaneously encompass every parallel chance . Every non - choice . Every possibility . ”
4983	5010	5011	5011	Nate	1114	“ Well , that ’s just scary ! Please do n’t send me to a planet where my brother - in - law runs your company . ”
5014	5049	5011	5011	Nate	1114	“ But I do like the idea that there ’s a universe in which I did not step out onto the ice yesterday and then mess up our end - of - season workflow . ”
5054	5073	5050	5050	His	1114	“ It ’s going to be okay , Bec . What ’s a little more chaos between friends ? ”
5074	5077	5078	5078	I	113	“ Right ? ”
5101	5104	5105	5105	his	1114	“ Hey , ”
5127	5138	5110	5110	He	1114	“ Would you tell me if you were n’t okay ? ”
5139	5142	5110	5110	He	1114	“ Yes . ”
5148	5159	5110	5110	He	1114	“ In a few days I ’ll probably feel great . ”
5160	5190	5110	5110	He	1114	“ I hope so . Besides — the team still has to get us there . My model predicts we ’ll clinch our playoffs spot a week from tonight . ”
5191	5198	5199	5199	I	113	“ In this universe , right ? ”
5202	5207	5208	5208	he	1114	“ Listen , bitch , ”
5219	5224	5213	5213	we	475	“ listen , bitch , ”
5269	5274	5256	5256	we	475	“ Listen , bitch ! ”
5308	5317	5318	5318	I	113	“ Clinching the playoffs next week , huh ? ”
5326	5334	5318	5318	I	113	“ I ’d better chill the champagne . ”
5335	5342	5343	5343	His	1114	“ That ’s more like it . ”
5374	5394	5343	5343	His	1114	“ Are you going to be able to get the peace and quiet here that you need to heal ? ”
5395	5401	5402	5402	I	113	“ It ’ll be fine , ”
5405	5417	5402	5402	I	113	“ We ’re usually not all home at the same time . ”
5439	5449	5435	5435	Nate	1114	“ You ’ll call me if you need anything ? ”
5450	5454	5455	5455	I	113	“ Of course , ”
5525	5546	5513	5513	I	113	“ Be well , Bec . Do n’t try to do too much before the doctors say it ’s okay . ”
5547	5554	5555	5555	He	1114	“ All right . I promise . ”
6238	6241	6242	6242	he	505	“ Fuck ! ”
6245	6248	6249	6251	the other player	507	“ Switch ! ”
6299	6311	6312	6312	he	505	“ Heads ’ up , Nate ! You have a visitor , ”
6380	6388	6363	6363	He	511	“ Dude , you have a visitor . ”
6612	6616	6617	6621	the Ping - Pong player	511	“ Holy shit , ”
6647	6669	6636	6637	The guy	517	“ Did you just write a shorter algo for determining the range of our … Holy shit ! That ’s epic . ”
6678	6702	6670	6670	Nate	1114	“ I just saved you about three days of coding . How about you buy lunch ? It ’s your turn , anyway . ”
6703	6724	6670	6670	Nate	1114	“ Fine . But I ’m in the mood for Chinese . Now greet your guest , you rude fucker . ”
6841	6847	6848	6848	He	1114	“ Wait , you ’re … ”
6870	6875	6876	6878	the other guy	523	“ … Rebecca Rowley , ”
6901	6907	6888	6888	He	1114	“ Here ’s her résumé . ”
6914	6920	6911	6912	baby Jesus	101	“ Nice to meet you , ”
6935	6946	6921	6921	Rebecca	115	“ I heard you were looking for an office manager . ”
6971	6989	6947	6947	Nate	1114	“ We are n’t very good at the corporate stuff . It ’s time , I guess . ”
6990	6996	6997	6998	his coworker	112	“ It ’s past time , ”
7009	7024	7001	7001	He	1114	“ I ’m Stew . You ’re the one Henry sent over , right ? ”
7025	7028	7001	7001	He	1114	“ Right . ”
7029	7034	7035	7035	He	1114	“ Good , good . ”
7039	7050	7035	7035	He	1114	“ Interview her . Ten minutes . We need this . ”
7179	7189	7190	7190	he	1114	“ Let ’s find you a place to sit , ”
7244	7249	7250	7250	he	1114	“ Have a seat , ”
7280	7325	7267	7267	He	1114	“ There are seven of us . Stewie handles all the money stuff . But the office itself is kind of a free - for - all . Phones are n’t always answered . People come and go . Our files are a disaster . ”
7343	7366	7367	7367	Nate	1114	“ We all work at least forty hours on - site , but not the same forty hours . It ’s flexible , ”
7380	7401	7402	7402	He	1114	“ What ’s your availability ? You , uh , probably sent me a cover letter with this résumé but … ”
7412	7417	7418	7418	she	526	“ Full - time , ”
7422	7438	7439	7439	She	526	“ I can take whatever hours you give me . And I ’m available immediately . ”
7445	7448	7449	7449	he	1114	“ Awesome , ”
7472	7478	7479	7479	He	1114	“ If I may ask … ”
7484	7500	7479	7479	He	1114	“ Why the sudden availability ? Seems like you were in school until last month . ”
7501	7504	7505	7505	she	526	“ Right , ”
7509	7528	7505	7505	she	526	“ My father died two months ago . It makes more sense for me to be working now . ”
7529	7532	7533	7533	he	1114	“ Oh , ”
7538	7544	7533	7533	he	1114	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
7571	7594	7565	7565	She	526	“ Thank you , but I ’m fine and ready to work . Your messy office does n’t scare me , mister . ”
7635	7657	7623	7624	Nate Kattenberger	1114	“ We definitely need the help . It ’s not a very structured environment . Maybe you could work on that . ”
7695	7698	7699	7699	Rebecca	1114	“ Oh ! ”
7732	7745	7717	7717	Nate	1114	“ They ’re all palindromes . Your T - shirt , too . ”
7750	7772	7773	7773	he	1114	“ Good eye . Palindromes are a thing with me . My fiancée made the wall mural . Do you code ? ”
7777	7782	7809	7809	her	526	“ No ! Sorry . ”
7786	7807	7809	7809	her	526	“ But palindromes have been around for centuries . Even in ancient Greece . Literature is kind of my thing . ”
7812	7817	7818	7818	Nate	1114	“ Literature , huh ? ”
7823	7833	7835	7835	she	526	“ Right . I was majoring in comparative lit . ”
7937	7946	7947	7947	Nate	1114	“ What else should I know about you ? ”
7950	7957	7958	7958	she	526	“ I ’m a good worker , ”
7962	7974	7958	7958	she	526	“ I had a three - point - nine grade average … ”
7975	7983	8017	8017	He	1114	“ Which class gave you the B ? ”
7993	8016	7986	7986	he	1114	“ Bio lab . But in my defense , the course description did n’t say anything about dissecting a pig ’s eye . ”
8031	8047	8048	8048	She	526	“ I ’m , um , very reliable . There ’s a stack of references … ”
8092	8098	8082	8082	Nate	1114	“ Any questions for me ? ”
8103	8116	8082	8082	Nate	1114	“ What do you need your office assistant to do , primarily ? ”
8123	8195	8117	8117	He	1114	“ I ’ve never had an assistant before . So we ’ll have to figure it out as we go . But we ’re gearing up for a big trade show in March . We ’ll need to make posters and crap . We need a schedule , and a new website for the company . We need to hire an advertising agency . That all sounds pretty time - consuming … ”
8214	8220	8221	8221	she	526	“ That all sounds doable , ”
8224	8238	8221	8221	she	526	“ I could help organize all those projects . Keep things on track . ”
8245	8258	8239	8239	Nate	1114	“ Sorry . Sometimes I do n’t pay attention when people talk . ”
8298	8312	8313	8313	he	1114	“ … But I always make time for my mom and my fiancée , ”
8317	8343	8313	8313	he	1114	“ Her name is Juliet . The fiancée , that is . Mom is Linda . Their calls always matter . Everyone else can wait . ”
8392	8406	8380	8380	Stew	143	“ How ’s it going over here ? Are you making plans already ? ”
8407	8411	8412	8412	Nate	1114	“ Seems so , ”
8415	8421	8422	8422	He	1114	“ I was just telling … ”
8431	8434	8435	8435	she	526	“ Rebecca , ”
8444	8453	8454	8454	Nate	1114	“ … All that needs to be done , ”
8459	8497	8498	8498	he	1114	“ Like , we take turns paying for lunch , because that ’s the only way we remember to eat . Someone should formalize the rotation . Somehow it ’s always my turn . But if we — ”
8502	8527	8498	8498	he	1114	“ — could finish the fucking beta of version three by the next month , I ’ll buy lunch every day for two weeks . ”
8553	8582	8548	8548	Nate	1114	“ Okay , Rebecca . You can start whenever . There are probably some forms you ’ll have to fill out . Stewie will know what they are . ”
8583	8587	8588	8588	Her	526	“ Employment forms ? ”
8599	8605	8588	8588	Her	526	“ W-4 ? And I-9 ? ”
8615	8618	8619	8619	He	1114	“ Right . ”
8623	8635	8636	8636	He	1114	“ Good stuff . Stew ? Can you make that happen ? ”
8667	8670	8671	8671	Stew	143	“ Dude , ”
8678	8691	8671	8671	Stew	143	“ Hold up . There ’s a few details you skipped over . ”
8700	8703	8704	8704	Stew	143	“ Salary , ”
8716	8722	8713	8713	Stew	143	“ What about stock options ? ”
8728	8736	8723	8723	Nate	1114	“ Nah . Not for clerical staff . ”
8782	8812	8813	8813	He	1114	“ Okay . I have to get back to work . But your first job is to order yourself a computer . Matty will give you our vendor login . ”
8824	8837	8813	8813	He	1114	“ And fill out those forms . Welcome aboard , Rebecca Rowley . ”
8891	8900	8903	8903	Lauren	91	“ This is as far as I go , ”
8960	8964	8965	8965	I	113	“ Fair enough , ”
8969	8979	8965	8965	I	113	“ I ’ll only be a couple of minutes . ”
9262	9266	9267	9267	I	113	“ You guys , ”
9279	9291	9267	9267	I	113	“ You ’re killing it , and I ’m so impressed . ”
9301	9352	9292	9292	I	113	“ I ’m not going to stand here and tell you how much the next three games matter , because you already know . I ’m a cocky guy , but I ’m not arrogant enough to tell you how to play hockey . That ’s your coach ’s job . ”
9358	9434	9292	9292	I	113	“ But I will say this — you’re headed back into enemy territory tomorrow . You ’re facing the team with the best record in the division . They ’re pretty sure they can knock you out of the playoffs in the next two games . And with twenty - thousand of their fans screaming at you in the stadium , it would be tempting to believe them . But you ’re not going to . ”
9511	9583	9584	9584	Trevi	127	“ You beat DC three times already this season , and all because you believed you could . Faith is the difference between the winner and the loser in every contest . I ca n’t do what you do . My slapshot is just a little less impressive than yours . But I ’ve had plenty of experience with people telling me I ca n’t do the shit I want to . ”
9634	9711	9719	9720	my players	563	“ There are smarter guys than me still working grunt jobs in Cupertino or Palo Alto . They have the brains , but not the guts to risk everything on their own ideas . I meet these guys all the time . I hire these guys to work 60 hours a week for me . They get a nice salary and benefits . But they do n’t ever get to say , I built this myself . ”
9723	9789	9719	9720	my players	563	“ You ’re not that guy . You ’re the kind that says , ‘ I ’m doing this . I do n’t care if Brooklyn is n’t supposed to beat DC . I do n’t care if their first line has been skating together since I was in diapers . None of that shit matters because I am here to change the rules . ’ ”
9839	9882	9801	9802	That fucker	579	“ Say — why not me ? Why not now . If not now , then when ? Go and take it from them , boys . Not because some pundits gave you permission . But just because you know you can . ”
9883	9887	9888	9888	Beacon	571	“ Fuck yeah ! ”
9950	9956	9941	9941	Lauren	91	“ Very inspiring , boss . ”
9957	9961	9962	9962	She	91	“ Thank you . ”
9972	10002	9962	9962	She	91	“ The car is waiting to take you to Manhattan . Engineering meeting at noon . Lunch at one . Accountants at two . And Alex needs a call . ”
10177	10187	10188	10188	I	113	“ Now , who was I supposed to call ? ”
10257	10260	10261	10261	Lauren	91	“ Nate ! ”
10269	10274	10261	10261	Lauren	91	“ Sorry . What ? ”
10275	10308	10341	10341	Lauren	91	“ Do n’t ask me a question and then zone out ! The call is with Alex . She wants to iron out a few last minute details about the benefit party . ”
10328	10340	10261	10261	Lauren	91	“ Do n’t we hire people to worry about that shit ? ”
10357	10382	10341	10341	Lauren	91	“ Yes . But Alex just wants to check your schedule . She said something about meeting privately for drinks before the event begins . ”
10383	10395	10341	10341	Lauren	91	“ Hmm . Did she say why we ’re doing that ? ”
10396	10401	10402	10402	Lauren	91	“ Gosh , Nate ! ”
10409	10461	10402	10402	Lauren	91	“ Maybe it ’s because you ’ve been friends since your drunken college days ? I did n’t ask . She did n’t offer . Is there a reason you would n’t want to see Alex ? If so , throwing a party with her was kind of a strange choice . ”
10474	10479	10480	10480	I	113	“ Well , but … ”
10507	10529	10497	10497	I	113	“ The timing is awkward because my investment bankers are talking to one of Alex ’s competitors about my router division . ”
10550	10570	10537	10537	I	113	“ Ah . You need Alex to be the second bidder on that business unit , not the first . ”
10571	10574	10530	10530	Lauren	91	“ Exactly . ”
10575	10586	10587	10587	She	91	“ So , I should make you unavailable for drinks ? ”
10592	10613	10587	10587	She	91	“ That ’s shady , though . And if your flight is delayed , you could miss your own party . ”
10614	10654	10530	10530	Lauren	91	“ Nah — it ’s okay . Set it up . I can survive an hour with her alone . If she wants to talk shop I ’ll just tell her I ’m not ready to think about it . ”
10655	10673	10674	10674	Lauren	91	“ All right . Or — here ’s a novel idea — you could bring a date . ”
10677	10689	10674	10674	Lauren	91	“ Alex wo n’t talk mergers and acquisitions with a stranger . ”
10690	10699	10700	10700	She	91	“ Interesting idea , Miss Crafty . Interesting . ”
10861	10873	10852	10852	she	91	“ Nate . Jesus Christ . I asked you a question . ”
10884	10894	10874	10874	I	113	“ Sorry . I missed what you just said . ”
10895	10902	10903	10903	she	91	“ Thank you for admitting it , ”
10907	10913	10903	10903	she	91	“ That ’s a first . ”
10939	10957	10930	10930	We	604	“ I ’m a little distracted today . Ca n’t stop thinking about tomorrow night ’s game . ”
11082	11102	11103	11103	Lauren	91	“ Usually when you get like this , I just get up and walk away and try again later , ”
11106	11141	11103	11103	Lauren	91	“ But you need to be in Manhattan for the engineering meeting at noon . And it ’s 11:15 already . If we do n’t finish up , you ’re going to be late . ”
11144	11161	11142	11142	Ah	606	“ Then there ’s no problem . Because I changed the engineering meeting to two o’clock . ”
11175	11189	11162	11162	Lauren	91	“ If that ’s true , why does the schedule still say noon ? ”
11193	11201	11162	11162	Lauren	91	“ Maybe I forgot to cc you ? ”
11234	11250	11162	11162	Lauren	91	“ Hey ! Cut it out . We already have enough head injuries around here . ”
11263	11341	11251	11251	She	91	“ But I just set up a conference call for you at two o’clock ! And when I told you so , not three minutes ago , when you were staring down the hallway , you grunted like that was fine ! But it ’s not fine . Now I have to go back and reach the tax department to tell them that we have to reschedule this conference call for the third time in three days . ”
11342	11347	11348	11348	I	113	“ Sorry , sorry . ”
11356	11387	11348	11348	I	113	“ I ’d offer to commit ritual suicide to convince you of my sincere apology , but I suspect that would just mean you had to reschedule even more stuff . ”
11420	11436	11388	11388	Lauren	91	“ Just tell me this . Why did you push the engineering meeting until two ? ”
11454	11476	11449	11452	a very good one	609	“ Game five could be a real change in momentum for us . I wanted to watch this morning ’s practice . ”
11555	11562	11548	11548	she	91	“ Nate , are you okay ? ”
11579	11585	11563	11563	Her	91	“ Of course . Why ? ”
11610	11615	11616	11616	I	113	“ Enough about me , ”
11623	11634	11616	11616	I	113	“ How are you holding up with this whole situation ? ”
11635	11641	11642	11642	she	91	“ By ‘ situation , ’ ”
11650	11670	11642	11642	she	91	“ do you mean the way you ’re forcing me to travel with hockey players ? Who I hate ? ”
11671	11677	11678	11678	I	113	“ Or claim to hate . ”
11762	11767	11768	11768	I	113	“ Go on up , ”
11771	11786	11768	11768	I	113	“ I swear I ’ll find my way to Manhattan before my two o’clock . ”
11795	11807	11787	11787	I	113	“ Get out of here . You know you want to . ”
11808	11814	11768	11768	I	113	“ Raise your right hand . ”
11823	11842	11787	11787	I	113	“ I solemnly swear I will not make Lauren reschedule anything else for the rest of the week . ”
11843	11850	11851	11851	I	113	“ The week ? Come on . ”
11856	11872	11851	11851	I	113	“ Ask my car to wait , okay ? I ’ll be in it soon . ”
11873	11878	11879	11879	she	91	“ You ’d better , ”
11920	11926	11927	11927	she	91	“ Give Rebecca my love , ”
11949	11952	11957	11957	Lauren	91	“ Uh … ”
12009	12031	12003	12003	Lauren	91	“ If Dr. Herberts clears Becca to come back to work , I want to be the first person who knows . ”
12032	12037	12038	12038	I	113	“ You will be , ”
12042	12053	12086	12086	She	91	“ I ’ll be on the first subway to Manhattan . ”
12054	12060	12086	12086	She	91	“ I know you will . ”
12061	12066	12067	12067	she	91	“ I hate you , ”
12078	12085	12086	12086	She	91	“ No , you do n’t . ”
12199	12203	12204	12205	the doctor	629	“ Come in , ”
12248	12252	12243	12243	she	631	“ Any news ? ”
12265	12304	12259	12260	Dr. Herberts	131	“ Since Rebecca is not a hockey player , she enjoys doctor - patient privilege . I ca n’t discuss her case without her permission . And since you ’re her boss , she might feel pressured to … ”
12311	12327	12305	12305	She	631	“ It ’s okay . I do n’t mind at all if Nate listens in . ”
12382	12415	12363	12364	Dr. Herberts	131	“ All right . Rebecca is still ailing . Her balance is off , and she ’s troubled by noise . She ’s easily tired , and physical exertion leaves her nauseated . ”
12451	12512	12513	12513	Jesus	101	“ That said , she ’s passed every cognitive test . Her memory is sound . Her thinking is clear . She ’s easily frustrated , but that may not be a clinical symptom , but rather a natural reaction to a distressing situation . In short , the presentation of her head injury is not like a classic concussion . ”
12515	12521	12513	12513	Jesus	101	“ Then what is it ? ”
12535	12561	12522	12523	The doctor	629	“ There ’s a specialist I want her to see in Manhattan . He ’s the guy to whom we send all the toughest cases . ”
12562	12565	12566	12566	I	113	“ Okay , ”
12578	12583	12566	12566	I	113	“ Who is it ? ”
12584	12644	12522	12523	The doctor	629	“ Dr. Evan Armitage . He ’s a neurologist who specializes in post - concussion and vestibular therapy . And he loves a good riddle . I ’m certain he can figure out what ’s troubling Rebecca . The only thing I do n’t like about him is his packed schedule . Might be tricky to get an appointment . ”
12666	12717	12754	12755	the doctor	629	“ If Armitage ca n’t see you , there are a couple of other guys I can call . In the meantime , I ’d like to see you getting more rest , young lady . It ’s hard for the brain to recover without a whole lot of rest . ”
12718	12722	12723	12723	she	131	“ All right , ”
12727	12743	12723	12723	she	131	“ Are we done here for now ? I ’ll call Dr. Armitage this afternoon . ”
12744	12753	12754	12755	the doctor	629	“ We ’re done any time you wish , ”
12765	12774	12759	12759	Becca	1114	“ Thank you very much for the consult . ”
12775	12789	12754	12755	the doctor	629	“ It ’s my pleasure . Call me anytime . Day or night . ”
12803	12808	12809	12809	I	113	“ Running off already ? ”
12812	12819	12809	12809	I	113	“ Got a minute for me ? ”
12820	12824	12826	12826	she	131	“ Of course . ”
13031	13034	13035	13035	she	131	“ Shit ! ”
13069	13082	13062	13062	she	131	“ Hey . Take a minute , okay ? What was that ? ”
13083	13086	13087	13087	She	131	“ Nothing . ”
13090	13101	13087	13087	She	131	“ I just got disoriented . It ’s so bright . ”
13134	13138	13125	13125	I	113	“ Come on . ”
13226	13229	13230	13230	I	113	“ Better ? ”
13233	13236	13237	13237	Rebecca	1114	“ Yes . ”
13243	13249	13237	13237	Rebecca	1114	“ I ’m okay now . ”
13250	13256	13262	13262	I	113	“ Like hell you are . ”
13267	13274	13262	13262	I	113	“ Let ’s get you home . ”
13281	13286	13275	13275	She	131	“ I ’m going . ”
13287	13294	13295	13295	I	113	“ I ’ve got the car . ”
13303	13312	13295	13295	I	113	“ Let me tell him to pull around . ”
13313	13327	13275	13275	She	131	“ Jesus . It ’s two blocks , Nate . I ’m okay . ”
13354	13360	13344	13344	I	113	“ I ’ll walk you . ”
13361	13368	13369	13369	she	131	“ I wish you would n’t , ”
13374	13377	13372	13372	Ouch	137	“ Why ? ”
13378	13382	13383	13383	She	131	“ Because I … ”
13414	13487	13409	13409	I	113	“ I ca n’t stand this . I ca n’t stand being such a mess . And I ca n’t stand missing work . I ’m sorry for the big fucking disruption , okay ? Do n’t spend any more time on me . There ’s ten other places you ’re supposed to be right now , and Lauren is somewhere sharpening her talons to shred up both of us , probably . ”
13488	13496	13383	13383	She	131	“ Now wait a minute , hothead . ”
13524	13542	13515	13515	I	113	“ Some things are more important than a little kink in the schedule . Like your health . ”
13543	13547	13548	13548	She	131	“ I know ! ”
13561	13599	13548	13548	She	131	“ But I ’m so sick of me ! It ’s been three weeks . With no change . Every night I go to bed thinking that tomorrow I ’ll feel better . But I do n’t . ”
13641	13647	13648	13648	I	113	“ You will feel better , ”
13691	13709	13710	13710	she	131	“ Remember when you visited my apartment , and we had the stupid conversation about parallel universes ? ”
13713	13733	13710	13710	she	131	“ Well , I think I ’m in one . In this universe , nothing works right for me . ”
13734	13739	13687	13687	Rebecca	1114	“ You ’re scared . ”
13740	13747	13748	13748	Her	131	“ Of course I ’m scared ! ”
13753	13780	13748	13748	Her	131	“ You and Hugh have been great . Really great . But I need to show up for work eventually . It ’s what people do . ”
13781	13809	13687	13687	Rebecca	1114	“ No — you take all the time you need . I do n’t care how long that is . How long have we known each other ? ”
13817	13823	13810	13810	She	131	“ Seven years . But … ”
13824	13847	13889	13889	She	131	“ But nothing . You ’re not some flaky intern who does n’t know what it means to hold down a job . ”
13848	13862	13810	13810	She	131	“ Nate , there are limits to sick days in the employee handbook . ”
13863	13872	13889	13889	She	131	“ What page ? I ’ll change them . ”
13919	13923	13924	13924	I	113	“ Come on , ”
13927	13940	13924	13924	I	113	“ This is you and me . We always figure something out . ”
13955	13993	13941	13941	She	131	“ Dr. Herberts thinks this specialist might be able to figure out why I ’m having such a rough time . But even if he puts a label on it , I wo n’t magically get better . ”
13994	14004	14005	14005	I	113	“ It ’s a start , though , Bec . ”
14033	14043	14026	14026	I	113	“ You ’re not very good at being patient . ”
14044	14049	14050	14050	She	131	“ I noticed that . ”
14054	14061	14050	14050	She	131	“ I ’ll work on it . ”
14062	14075	14026	14026	I	113	“ There ’s one thing I want you to do for me . ”
14076	14081	14050	14050	She	131	“ What ’s that ? ”
14142	14151	14152	14152	I	113	“ I ’ll tell you in the car , ”
14321	14335	14315	14315	Nate	1114	“ Can I ask why you ’re not sleeping ? Herberts mentioned that . ”
14336	14344	14345	14345	I	113	“ It ’s not a huge problem , ”
14358	14376	14348	14348	I	113	“ My nephew is teething , and my , uh , sister ’s boyfriend works odd hours . ”
14385	14425	14348	14348	I	113	“ When he comes in at three in the morning , I always hear him . And since Matthew likes to wake my sister to nurse at all hours , there ’s just always someone bumping around the apartment . ”
14426	14429	14430	14430	Nate	1114	“ Hmm , ”
14433	14441	14430	14430	Nate	1114	“ That ca n’t be helping you . ”
14442	14452	14348	14348	I	113	“ It is n’t the end of the world . ”
14453	14460	14430	14430	Nate	1114	“ Will you call the specialist ? ”
14461	14467	14348	14348	I	113	“ Of course I will . ”
14468	14499	14430	14430	Nate	1114	“ No , I mean right now . If the guy is really that busy , you need to get a spot on his docket before it ’s too late . ”
14588	14620	14625	14625	June	139	“ Well , we ’re booking for mid - June . If that ’s okay with you , I ’m happy to put you down for two o’clock on the sixteenth . ”
14621	14624	14625	14625	June	139	“ Okay … ”
14667	14670	14671	14671	Nate	1114	“ Well ? ”
14704	14711	14694	14694	I	113	“ She gave me June sixteenth . ”
14712	14722	14681	14681	He	1114	“ June ? Like , two months from now ? ”
14723	14726	14727	14727	I	113	“ Yep . ”
14731	14738	14727	14727	I	113	“ Nate . What the hell ? ”
14739	14745	14681	14681	He	1114	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
14776	14785	14769	14769	Nate	1114	“ It seems we ’re at your house ? ”
14786	14798	14727	14727	I	113	“ Dr. Herberts was right — your cognitive abilities are unscathed . ”
14806	14821	14799	14799	I	113	“ Do n’t be a wise ass . Why did you bring me here ? ”
14822	14838	14769	14769	Nate	1114	“ For lunch , for starters . And we ’ll talk about my other plan . ”
14977	14986	14987	14991	A plump , smiling woman	668	“ Hello , dears ! Is that Rebecca ? ”
15008	15014	15015	15015	Nate	1114	“ Hello , Mrs. Gray ! ”
15033	15039	15015	15015	Nate	1114	“ How have you been ? ”
15040	15056	15057	15058	Mrs. Gray	140	“ Better than you , if I ’ve heard correctly . How is your noggin ? ”
15061	15069	15057	15058	Mrs. Gray	140	“ Still a bit under the weather ? ”
15094	15114	15115	15115	he	1114	“ I know I did n’t call ahead , but is there something you could feed us for lunch ? ”
15131	15165	15194	15195	Mrs. Gray	140	“ But of course ! Do you think so poorly of me ? In five minutes , I can give you Caesar salad with chicken and a bowl of tomato soup with croutons . ”
15166	15170	15171	15171	Nate	1114	“ Thank you , ”
15177	15183	15171	15171	Nate	1114	“ That would be perfect . ”
15184	15193	15194	15195	Mrs. Gray	140	“ It ’s only perfect if Rebecca agrees , ”
15198	15212	15194	15195	Mrs. Gray	140	“ I can make her a sandwich if that menu does n’t suit . ”
15213	15220	15221	15221	I	113	“ Soup and salad sound lovely , ”
15225	15229	15230	15230	Nate	1114	“ Mrs. Gray ? ”
15240	15262	15230	15230	Nate	1114	“ Rebecca is going to be staying here for a little while . I ’ll put her in the green bedroom . ”
15263	15266	15267	15267	I	113	“ What ? ”
15287	15292	15293	15293	Nate	1114	“ Hear me out , ”
15326	15366	15314	15314	Nate	1114	“ Your apartment is too noisy . This house has six bedrooms . I ’m headed to Washington DC tomorrow . You ’ll have complete privacy . Give it a week . See if the quiet helps you rest . ”
15374	15381	15367	15367	I	113	“ I ca n’t stay here . ”
15386	15390	15367	15367	I	113	“ Why not ? ”
15391	15403	15404	15404	I	113	“ Well , I just ca n’t , that ’s all . ”
15422	15428	15404	15404	I	113	“ You ’re my boss . ”
15435	15457	15429	15429	Nate	1114	“ I did n’t ask you as your employer . I asked as your friend . Just tell me one thing . ”
15458	15461	15429	15429	Nate	1114	“ What ? ”
15462	15484	15429	15429	Nate	1114	“ If I was injured and scared and not sleeping well , would you offer me one of your six bedrooms ? ”
15485	15490	15491	15491	I	113	“ Well , sure . ”
15508	15511	15512	15512	He	1114	“ Good . ”
15530	15537	15538	15538	he	1114	“ Then let ’s eat lunch , ”
15761	15764	15765	15766	Mrs. Gray	140	“ Nathan , ”
15776	15781	15765	15766	Mrs. Gray	140	“ Phubbing is rude . ”
15782	15785	15786	15786	he	1114	“ Phubbing ? ”
15792	15831	15765	15766	Mrs. Gray	140	“ Phone snubbing . God knows you usually dine alone , when it does n’t matter . But Rebecca is your once - a - millennium guest , and the least you could do is talk to her . ”
15854	15871	15839	15839	Nate	1114	“ Thank you for your input , but I ’m trying to help Becca with something . ”
15882	15895	15872	15872	He	1114	“ Is Dr. Evan Armitage on the board of any charitable organizations ? ”
15906	15918	15919	15919	He	1114	“ Ah , this is just what I was looking for . ”
15984	15995	15962	15962	He	1114	“ Bec , what ’s that busy doctor ’s number ? ”
15996	16000	16001	16001	I	113	“ Hold on . ”
16013	16019	16001	16001	I	113	“ What are you doing ? ”
16020	16029	16030	16030	He	1114	“ I ’m getting your appointment date changed . ”
16035	16043	15962	15962	He	1114	“ How are you going to … ? ”
16044	16047	16048	16048	Nate	1114	“ Yes , ”
16054	16120	16048	16048	Nate	1114	“ I think you can help me . This is Nate Kattenberger calling for Dr. Armitage . Could you let him know that I ’ve just donated $ 50,000 to the Concussion Legacy Foundation ? It ’s my gift to honor the doctor ’s work with athletes . If he ’d like to discuss the matter further , I ’m available at the following number … ”
16121	16126	16127	16127	I	113	“ What on earth ? ”
16139	16148	16149	16149	Nate	1114	“ Do n’t get all stressy , Bec . ”
16159	16201	16149	16149	Nate	1114	“ I like that charity . Dr. Armitage chose well when he got involved with them . And , hey , professional sports teams are too cavalier about head injuries . I should have given them money a long time ago . ”
16202	16205	16206	16206	Nate	1114	“ But … ”
16214	16221	16222	16222	He	1114	“ That was speedy . Hello ? ”
16227	16292	16222	16222	He	1114	“ Yes , Doctor , this is he . Indeed I did . You ’re right , I do own a hockey team … That ’s the one ! Concussion research is very important to me . Seemed like as good a time as any to make a contribution … Right . It ’s such an important topic . More so now than ever . ”
16310	16320	16321	16321	Nate	1114	“ I ’m with you , a hundred percent , ”
16329	16378	16321	16321	Nate	1114	“ In fact , there ’s someone sitting here beside me who really needs some assistance with a head injury . We ’d like to see you sooner rather than later . Unfortunately , your front office thinks that a June appointment is the best you can do . ”
16403	16412	16413	16413	Nate	1114	“ Oh , terrific . That ’s perfect , ”
16419	16447	16448	16448	Nate	1114	“ Sunday morning at ten , then . The patient ’s name is Rebecca Rowley . She ’ll be there . Thanks very much . Bye now . ”
16457	16473	16448	16448	Nate	1114	“ The good doctor is seeing you on a Sunday ! Now that ’s service . ”
16487	16504	16474	16474	I	113	“ Tell me you did n’t shake down the specialist to get me an appointment time ? ”
16522	16549	16515	16515	He	1114	“ Nah . I ’m pretty sure a shakedown would be if someone took his money . This was , like , the opposite of that . ”
16550	16567	16568	16568	My	113	“ Fifty . Thousand . Dollars ? I can not believe you just gave that away … ”
16585	16594	16595	16595	He	1114	“ Well , technically I did n’t yet . ”
16612	16653	16595	16595	He	1114	“ Robert — this is Nate . Please donate fifty - thousand dollars to the Concussion Legacy Foundation before the close of business today . This is from the personal account — not the corporate foundation . Thanks , man . ”
16654	16657	16658	16658	I	113	“ Nate ! ”
16666	16707	16661	16661	He	1114	“ It ’s a good cause , Bec . The best . The owner of a hockey team is supposed to care about concussion research . And you need an appointment with him . It ’s a win - win . ”
16708	16713	16714	16714	I	113	“ Oh my God . ”
16828	16831	16832	16832	Nate	1114	“ Hey . ”
16857	16873	16839	16839	he	1114	“ Becca . Everything is going to be okay . You know that , right ? ”
16876	16885	16886	16886	I	113	“ It ’s sort of hard to picture , ”
16945	16953	16932	16932	He	1114	“ You ’re so tight . Jeez . ”
17094	17098	17099	17099	I	113	“ Thank you , ”
17123	17140	17111	17111	Nate	1114	“ Let me show you upstairs real quick . You need to know how everything works . ”
17282	17289	17290	17290	he	1114	“ Down there is my room , ”
17304	17312	17290	17290	he	1114	“ And you ’ll stay in here . ”
17327	17341	17313	17313	I	113	“ Wow , Nate . This looks like Her Royal Majesty ’s chambers . ”
17342	17347	17290	17290	he	1114	“ Which Royal Majesty ? ”
17348	17356	17357	17357	Nate	1114	“ The Queen of France . Duh . ”
17394	17400	17377	17377	I	113	“ This room is crazy . ”
17401	17441	17290	17290	he	1114	“ I do n’t want to put you on the third floor . You should n’t be climbing too much if you ’re unsteady . And this is a nice room . My parents stay here when they visit . ”
17472	17496	17497	17497	I	113	“ Now let me show you the den . It ’s my main living space , and you can make yourself at home . ”
17633	17636	17637	17637	I	113	“ Wow , ”
17647	17657	17661	17661	he	703	“ This is my favorite room in the house . ”
17675	17680	17661	17661	he	703	“ Hello , Nate , ”
17686	17692	17661	17661	he	703	“ Can I help you ? ”
17693	17699	17700	17700	Nate	1114	“ Not now , Hal , ”
17703	17708	17709	17709	I	113	“ That was … ? ”
17712	17718	17719	17719	Nate	1114	“ Not a real person , ”
17725	17728	17719	17719	Nate	1114	“ Hal … ”
17729	17732	17733	17734	the machine	708	“ Yes ? ”
17738	17750	17751	17751	Nate	1114	“ … Is the voice of a product I ’m testing , ”
17754	17782	17751	17751	Nate	1114	“ I ’m trying to improve on the quality of smart speakers . They all suck , but Hal uses deep learning to quickly become more conversant . ”
17783	17787	17788	17788	I	113	“ Deep learning , ”
17792	17797	17788	17788	I	113	“ Like , AI ? ”
17798	17803	17804	17804	he	1114	“ Exactly like AI , ”
17814	17844	17804	17804	he	1114	“ He ’s a secret , by the way . Hal is one of the things covered by the specs of your KTech nondisclosure agreement . Yada yada yada . ”
17845	17849	17850	17850	I	113	“ Got it , ”
17879	17939	17804	17804	he	1114	“ The products on the market right now are all pretty dumb . But Hal is pretty sharp . So if you ask him for something and he does n’t respond correctly , just try again with slightly different words . And do n’t hold back on the slang because I want him to learn how people really speak . ”
17963	17981	17960	17960	he	159	“ Wait — you gave him the creepy computer voice from that Space Odyssey movie , right ? ”
17986	18011	17982	17982	Nate	1114	“ Just having a little fun . But he can do any kind of voice . How do you think the butler should sound ? ”
18012	18023	17982	17982	Nate	1114	“ Like a Jane Austen character . Charming and solicitous . ”
18029	18045	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ Like — what’s - his - name , the Colin Firth character ? Darcy ? ”
18046	18065	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ No way . Darcy did n’t like to talk . You need the other guy — Bingley . ”
18066	18073	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ Fine . Hey , Hal ? ”
18074	18079	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ Yes , Nate , ”
18084	18091	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ Your new name is Bingley . ”
18092	18098	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ Bingley at your service , ”
18104	18141	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ And I want you to use a different voice . Male . British accent . Blueblood . That means well - educated . Incorporate the sentence structure of Pride and Prejudice , by Jane Austen . ”
18142	18147	18245	18245	Nate	1114	“ Certainly , sir ! ”
18158	18166	18245	18245	Nate	1114	“ How may I be of service ? ”
18167	18173	18024	18024	Nate	1114	“ Say hello to Rebecca . ”
18174	18186	18245	18245	Nate	1114	“ Greetings , fair one ! Let me hear your voice . ”
18191	18207	18187	18187	Nate	1114	“ He needs to hear you so he ’ll know to obey when you speak . ”
18208	18215	18245	18245	Nate	1114	“ Uh . Hi , Bingley . ”
18223	18229	18245	18245	Nate	1114	“ I ’m Rebecca Rowley . ”
18230	18244	18245	18245	Nate	1114	“ At your service , miss ! You may ask anything of me . ”
18262	18273	18295	18295	Fine	89	“ Um , what is the capital of Burkina Faso ? ”
18274	18277	18295	18295	Fine	89	“ Ouagadougou . ”
18278	18282	18283	18283	Nate	1114	“ Too easy , ”
18286	18294	18283	18283	Nate	1114	“ Even Siri could get that right . ”
18297	18306	18295	18295	Fine	89	“ Who makes the best pizza in Brooklyn ? ”
18307	18314	18315	18315	Bingley	143	“ If you are feeling peckish , ”
18320	18353	18315	18315	Bingley	143	“ Grimaldi ’s is seven - tenths of a mile away , with a very high rating . Diners tend to recommend the white pie with garlic or the Buffalo chicken pizza . ”
18354	18357	18358	18358	I	113	“ No , ”
18361	18371	18358	18358	I	113	“ Buffalo chicken on a pizza is just wrong . ”
18372	18381	18382	18382	Bingley	143	“ I will make a note of it , ”
18386	18397	18382	18382	Bingley	143	“ Miss Rebecca does not prefer spicy chicken on pizza . ”
18405	18423	18424	18424	he	1114	“ Bingley — Rebecca will be staying with us a while to recover from a head injury , ”
18427	18447	18424	18424	he	1114	“ If she asks you to keep silent , please do n’t speak until she calls you by name . ”
18448	18469	18505	18505	Nate	1114	“ She ’s feeling ill ? Heavens ! Take care , Miss Rebecca . I sha n’t be a bother ! ”
18470	18476	18477	18477	I	113	“ Thank you , Bingley , ”
18519	18522	18523	18523	Nate	1114	“ So . ”
18529	18587	18523	18523	Nate	1114	“ Bingley controls the security system . Tonight , when Mrs. Gray leaves , all you have to do is ask him to lock the place up . He ’ll take care of everything . And if you leave the house , he ’ll let you back in . Bingley — take Rebecca ’s fingerprint , please . ”
18593	18607	18658	18658	Bingley	143	“ Miss Rebecca , deign to place your fair finger on the screen . ”
18638	18649	18631	18631	Bingley	143	“ Please choose a four - digit number , miss . ”
18650	18653	18654	18654	I	113	“ 7854 , ”
18669	18713	18658	18658	Bingley	143	“ Something to know — the keypad on the front door uses both your fingerprint and the number code . The fingerprint is sufficient , but if anyone is watching you enter the code , he wo n’t know that the fingerprint matters . ”
18714	18729	18730	18730	Bingley	143	“ We ca n’t have highwaymen snatching you off the street for your fingerprint , ”
18744	18749	18750	18750	Nate	1114	“ That ’s disturbing . ”
18753	18758	18750	18750	Nate	1114	“ Quiet , Bingley . ”
18759	18770	18771	18771	I	113	“ Nate , we do n’t have to do this , ”
18774	18782	18771	18771	I	113	“ I can just go home and … ”
18783	18786	18787	18787	he	1114	“ Hey ! ”
18796	18832	18787	18787	he	1114	“ Let ’s just try it . You need the rest . Do n’t argue or I ’ll upload Bingley to your phone and get him to nag your family into giving you more peace . ”
18842	18852	18834	18834	Nate	1114	“ But I do n’t have my things here … ”
18853	18861	18862	18862	He	1114	“ It ’ll be taken care of . ”
18868	18899	18862	18862	He	1114	“ I ’ve got to run or Lauren will flay me alive for fucking up the afternoon schedule . Mrs. Gray will make you dinner before she leaves . Later ! ”
18900	18905	18906	18906	Bingley	143	“ Goodbye , Nate , ”
18909	18924	18906	18906	Bingley	143	“ You ’re a prince among men ! You ’re smarter than Bill Gates ! ”
19483	19488	19489	19489	he	1114	“ You are priceless , ”
19644	19649	19650	19650	She	140	“ Hey , Stewie . ”
19661	19685	19650	19650	She	140	“ If you still want those presentations printed up in color for Tuesday , I ’ll need the file by noon on Monday . ”
19692	19705	19686	19689	The young corporate officer	737	“ Right . Sorry . You ’ll have them over the weekend . ”
19706	19712	19713	19713	She	140	“ No problem , honeybunch . ”
19916	19921	19922	19922	she	140	“ Yo , bossman , ”
19954	19966	19967	19967	she	140	“ You will call the CEO of ArtComm back on Monday , ”
19970	19997	19967	19967	she	140	“ I need you to stay on top of your calls for the next two months . Otherwise my life will be hell during your honeymoon . ”
19998	20005	20006	20006	Nate	1114	“ We ca n’t have that . ”
20039	20049	20031	20031	Rebecca	1114	“ How long am I going to be away ? ”
20050	20076	20077	20077	He	1114	“ Ten days , accounting for travel . And we ’re not scheduling anything on your first day back , so you can catch up . ”
20080	20094	20077	20077	He	1114	“ It ’s over Labor Day , though . The timing is perfect . ”
20095	20100	20101	20101	He	1114	“ Yeah . Okay . ”
20149	20157	20138	20139	the man	1114	“ What ’s next on my schedule ? ”
20158	20165	20124	20124	She	745	“ The weekend ? Remember those ? ”
20170	20181	20166	20166	He	1114	“ Your personal calendar says something like dinner with Bart . ”
20182	20187	20188	20188	He	1114	“ Does it really ? ”
20205	20211	20212	20213	Rebecca hedges	1114	“ I ’m pretty sure , ”
20236	20243	20223	20223	Nate	1114	“ Who ’s Bart , anyway ? ”
20244	20286	20220	20220	her	166	“ Some friend of Juliet ’s from her new gym . A jock who never shuts up about nutrition and his competitive edge . But Juliet is a CrossFit disciple now , so she finds it more interesting than I do . ”
20287	20290	20291	20291	Rebecca	1114	“ Oh . ”
20516	20523	20524	20524	Nate	1114	“ Maybe I ’ll leave early , ”
20533	20536	20537	20537	Rebecca	1114	“ Early ? ”
20547	20559	20537	20537	Rebecca	1114	“ That ’s possible ? How does it work , exactly ? ”
20584	20629	20577	20577	Nate	1114	“ I ’m starving . And I need a beer . Maybe I can get Juliet to get a couple drinks with me before dinner . And appetizers . Bart is the kind of tool who will make us eat at a vegan restaurant . ”
20640	20650	20651	20651	Nate	1114	“ … And I do n’t think he drinks . ”
20662	20670	20671	20671	Rebecca	1114	“ Lager , sir , is regal , ”
20690	20702	20671	20671	Rebecca	1114	“ You could sneak out early , too , I suppose . ”
20703	20706	20707	20707	She	762	“ Moi ? ”
20710	20731	20707	20707	She	762	“ No way . I ’ll sit quietly at my desk and meditate on your accomplishments until six o’clock comes . ”
20732	20745	20746	20746	He	1114	“ You kiss - ass . Have a great weekend , Bec . ”
20943	20951	20937	20937	Rebecca	1114	“ Nate ? Are you in there ? ”
21048	21051	21052	21052	she	762	“ Nate ? ”
21055	21060	21052	21052	she	762	“ Is something wrong ? ”
21072	21079	21061	21061	He	1114	“ I never go home early . ”
21080	21084	21085	21085	she	762	“ I know , ”
21341	21348	21349	21349	she	762	“ You said you were starved , ”
21383	21388	21377	21377	She	762	“ Chicken or cheese ? ”
21389	21393	21394	21394	he	1114	“ Thank you , ”
21436	21464	21421	21421	she	762	“ One shot just for a warm - up . Then we find you a hotel room before we ’re too drunk to Google the phone number . ”
21483	21490	21491	21491	Nate	1114	“ Bec , it ’s official . ”
21503	21513	21491	21491	Nate	1114	“ You are the employee of the fucking decade . ”
21567	21573	21574	21574	she	762	“ Drink up , sailor , ”
21577	21591	21574	21574	she	762	“ I ’m going to get you a room at the Soho Grand . ”
21597	21600	21592	21592	He	1114	“ Cheers . ”
21618	21624	21608	21608	she	762	“ So . Cat tacos ? ”
21625	21629	21630	21630	His	1114	“ Cat … ? ”
21646	21654	21630	21630	His	1114	“ Have you been saving that one ? ”
21655	21679	21695	21695	Nate	1114	“ For weeks . There are n’t any tacos in this neighborhood . So I finally just decided that empanadas were close enough . ”
22144	22154	22155	22155	she	786	“ Oh Nate . You make me so happy , ”
22246	22255	22256	22256	she	786	“ It only happened a couple of times , ”
22268	22287	22256	22256	she	786	“ But you ’re at work all the time . It is n’t fun being a tech widow . ”
22288	22301	22305	22305	I	113	“ Because I ’m trying to clear my calendar for our honeymoon ! ”
22333	22358	22330	22330	Juliet	120	“ I went to that gym because I felt bad about my belly fat . But it changed the way I look at myself . ”
22359	22367	22368	22368	I	113	“ You were just as beautiful before , ”
22389	22404	22405	22405	she	120	“ But I never thought a guy like Bart would look twice at me , ”
22417	22423	22424	22424	I	113	“ A guy like Bart , ”
22504	22509	22512	22512	I	113	“ we grew apart . ”
22515	22521	22522	22522	I	113	“ Take care of yourself , ”
22531	22553	22522	22522	I	113	“ I ’ll get my clothes on Sunday night while you ’re at the gym . Everything else you can keep . ”
22554	22565	22585	22585	she	805	“ Wait ! Nate ! It wo n’t happen again . ”
22626	22652	22619	22619	Stewie	117	“ It ’s time to get back out there . You know that ‘ married to your job ’ is just a saying , right ? ”
22761	22781	22746	22746	people	2391	“ A single , rich guy like you ? There must be a line of women around the block . ”
23215	23226	23227	23228	my housekeeper	835	“ My Christian is n’t a fan of Mexican food , ”
23232	23242	23227	23228	my housekeeper	835	“ He does n’t have a taste for spices . ”
23243	23248	23249	23249	Becca	1114	“ Wait a minute , ”
23252	23262	23249	23249	Becca	1114	“ Your husband ’s name is … Christian Gray ? ”
23263	23268	23227	23228	my housekeeper	835	“ That ’s right . ”
23269	23272	23273	23273	Rebecca	1114	“ But … ”
23276	23287	23273	23273	Rebecca	1114	“ There are books about a guy named Christian Gray — ”
23288	23304	23227	23228	my housekeeper	835	“ I know , dear ! I read the first one aloud to my husband . ”
23305	23308	23309	23309	Rebecca	1114	“ Really ? ”
23324	23373	23227	23228	my housekeeper	835	“ Absolutely ! When I showed him the lad ’s name in the book , he was curious . And when I got to the saucy bits he insisted I keep reading . ‘ Ca n’t let a pretend fellow have all the fun , ’ he said . ”
23436	23448	23429	23429	my	113	“ Mrs. Gray , you did n’t have to stay late . ”
23449	23470	23471	23471	she	140	“ I had a nice chat with the lovely Rebecca , while my Christian is bowling tonight with the boys , ”
23480	23501	23471	23471	she	140	“ He ’s always in a frowsy mood after some pints with his mates . I ’d better hurry home . ”
23579	23587	23588	23588	she	140	“ Here ’s your portion , Nate , ”
23591	23601	23588	23588	she	140	“ Now I must run , too . Toodles ! ”
23624	23631	23632	23632	Rebecca	1114	“ Mrs. Gray is something else , ”
23642	23650	23636	23636	she	140	“ I could n’t eat another bite . ”
23651	23661	23662	23662	I	113	“ You look better than you did this morning , ”
23693	23699	23700	23700	Rebecca	1114	“ I should hope so . ”
23707	23718	23700	23700	Rebecca	1114	“ Sleeping for five hours ought to have some benefit . ”
23719	23728	23729	23729	I	113	“ Five ? Wow . Rebecca Van Winkle . ”
23773	23777	23778	23778	Becca	1114	“ You know … ”
23787	23808	23778	23778	Becca	1114	“ I did n’t know I was so tired . And it is really quiet here . You were right . ”
23809	23812	23813	23813	I	113	“ Mmm , ”
23840	23846	23834	23834	I	113	“ Did your luggage arrive ? ”
23847	23850	23851	23851	Rebecca	1114	“ Hey , ”
23858	23882	23851	23851	Rebecca	1114	“ The luggage thing was a little heavy - handed . My sister left me text messages asking if I ’d been kidnapped . ”
23883	23888	23889	23889	I	113	“ Oh , please . ”
23907	23939	23889	23889	I	113	“ Ramesh said she was all too happy to help . In fact , Missy asked him to move the crib into your room to give her a little more space . ”
23940	23946	23947	23947	Becca	1114	“ Of course she did . ”
23950	23982	23947	23947	Becca	1114	“ Nate , this is silly . I can just go home . I ’m better rested already . If you ’ve reconsidered your invitation , I wo n’t be offended . ”
24003	24033	23991	23991	I	113	“ Stay , Bec . I ’m off to DC in the morning , anyway . Get a couple of decent nights ’ sleep . It ’s good medicine . ”
24034	24038	24039	24039	she	841	“ Thank you , ”
24233	24238	24239	24239	I	113	“ Want a beer ? ”
24242	24271	24239	24239	I	113	“ I wish . But I ’m not supposed to drink . Or read . Or watch TV . Or put myself in the position of being jostled . ”
24272	24280	24281	24281	I	113	“ Those are all my favorite things ! ”
24335	24348	24317	24318	Mrs. Gray	140	“ Orange juice ? Soda ? Seven different flavors of sparkling water ? ”
24349	24353	24354	24354	she	140	“ Surprise me , ”
24372	24378	24379	24379	I	113	“ Want to play … ? ”
24396	24399	24400	24400	I	113	“ Scrabble ? ”
24404	24418	24400	24400	I	113	“ It ’s not a screen . And you wo n’t be jostled . ”
24419	24431	24432	24432	she	140	“ But I will be soundly beaten by your big brain , ”
24436	24447	24432	24432	she	140	“ We ’d better keep the betting to a minimum . ”
24459	24465	24448	24448	I	113	“ We ’ll wager these . ”
24466	24470	24471	24471	Becca	1114	“ That works , ”
24562	24565	24553	24553	My	113	“ burp . ”
24582	24590	24591	24591	I	113	“ There should also be style points , ”
24600	24604	24605	24605	Nate	1114	“ For what ? ”
24608	24642	24591	24591	I	113	“ Anything cheeky . Bodily functions . Expletives . Double points for anything R - rated . Think of the marketing potential ! Teenaged boys would play Scrabble instead of Call of Duty . ”
24651	24665	24643	24643	Nate	1114	“ I was the teenaged Scrabble player who was always trying for palindromes . ”
24666	24676	24678	24678	I	113	“ We ca n’t all have a dirty mind . ”
24835	24840	24833	24833	Me	113	“ Nathan , sir ? ”
24868	24882	24847	24847	Bingley	143	“ Ramesh would like to know if you ’re in for the night . ”
24888	24896	24883	24883	He	1114	“ Absolutely . Engage all security systems . ”
24897	24901	24902	24902	Bingley	143	“ Systems engaged , ”
24916	24942	24913	24913	I	113	“ So , game five tomorrow ? I ’m dying . We have to advance so I can see another game before it ’s over . ”
24943	24948	24949	24949	he	1114	“ We ’ll advance , ”
24956	24980	24949	24949	he	1114	“ You ’re trying to distract me , are n’t you ? So I do n’t hit that triple word score with quixotic . ”
25002	25007	25008	25008	I	113	“ Listen , bitch , ”
25018	25028	25012	25012	I	113	“ Do your worst . I can take it . ”
25032	25037	25029	25029	He	1114	“ Are you sure ? ”
25038	25047	25029	25029	He	1114	“ O , Geronimo ! No minor ego . ”
25088	25100	25083	25083	I	113	“ Good to hear you making jokes over there , Bec . ”
25145	25163	25138	25138	I	113	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m tired already . All I did this afternoon was sleep . ”
25164	25167	25168	25168	he	1114	“ Good , ”
25176	25184	25168	25168	he	1114	“ Do that again tomorrow , too . ”
25185	25196	25199	25199	me	113	“ I wish I was going to DC for hockey . ”
25213	25219	25220	25220	he	1114	“ You ca n’t come , ”
25223	25255	25220	25220	he	1114	“ If you ’re there , the guys will put you to work . They ’re used to asking things of you , and you ’re too efficient to say no . “
25263	25303	25256	25256	I	113	“ But I ’m not sure how to pass the time . The no - reading thing is kind of tricky . And no screens ? I feel cut off from everyone , and I ’ve been really bored . ”
25304	25307	25308	25308	Nate	1114	“ Hmm . ”
25311	25318	25308	25308	Nate	1114	“ You can chat with Bingley . ”
25319	25324	25325	25326	the gentleman	1114	“ At your service ! ”
25339	25347	25325	25326	the gentleman	1114	“ What do we need , chaps ? ”
25348	25354	25355	25355	Nate	1114	“ Tell Rebecca a joke , ”
25358	25369	25370	25370	Bingley	143	“ Rightio ! Why did the scarecrow get a promotion ? ”
25373	25381	25370	25370	Bingley	143	“ He was outstanding in his field . ”
25409	25413	25414	25414	Nate	1114	“ Another one , ”
25417	25429	25414	25414	Nate	1114	“ If life gives you melons , you ’re probably dyslexic ! ”
25430	25440	25441	25441	Nate	1114	“ Jesus . The humor module needs some work , ”
25444	25451	25441	25441	Nate	1114	“ I ’ll tell my programmers . ”
25452	25459	25460	25460	I	113	“ There ’s a humor module ? ”
25470	25488	25460	25460	I	113	“ If only people could be taught to be funnier . Now there ’s a real innovation . ”
25498	25504	25505	25505	Bingley	143	“ I hate Russian dolls , ”
25508	25514	25505	25505	Bingley	143	“ So full of themselves . ”
25526	25533	25534	25534	I	113	“ Time for b - bed , ”
25605	25611	25612	25612	he	1114	“ Lights out , Bingley , ”
25617	25623	25612	25612	he	1114	“ Goodnight , sweet prince , ”
25628	25637	25612	25612	he	1114	“ Hamlet ? That ’s a little dark . ”
25638	25654	25612	25612	he	1114	“ Sorry , sir . Sleep with the angels . All security systems are engaged . ”
25798	25815	25785	25785	her	140	“ Rebecca ! Did you sleep well ? How do you like your eggs ? Coffee ? ”
25838	25843	25844	25844	I	113	“ I slept fine , ”
25853	25864	25844	25844	I	113	“ You really do n’t have to cook for me . ”
25865	25877	25816	25816	She	140	“ Nice try , cutie . Eggs ? There ’s bacon . ”
25878	25885	25844	25844	I	113	“ Well , in that case … ”
25901	25904	25905	25905	she	140	“ Ah ! ”
25920	25933	25979	25979	Rebecca	1114	“ This is for you . Nate told me to expect it . ”
26040	26045	26046	26046	I	113	“ Oh my God . ”
26075	26085	26064	26064	Outlander	179	“ This is because I complained about being bored . ”
26086	26090	26091	26092	Mrs Gray	140	“ Not anymore , ”
26095	26108	26109	26109	She	140	“ Not with Jamie Fraser whispering in your ear . That wedding ! ”
26117	26136	26137	26137	She	140	“ Now off you go ! Claire and that husband of hers bouncing the bed at the inn … ”
26265	26268	26269	26269	I	113	“ Bingley , ”
26275	26280	26269	26269	I	113	“ Yes , miss ? ”
26281	26297	26269	26269	I	113	“ How does a girl turn on that television ? There must be a trick . ”
26298	26311	26269	26269	I	113	“ Nate has informed me that screens are against your best interests . ”
26312	26320	26269	26269	I	113	“ Seriously ? He hid the remote . ”
26327	26341	26321	26321	Bingley	143	“ Miss , there is no remote . I control the entertainment system . ”
26342	26353	26269	26269	I	113	“ Holy crap . You ’re as pushy as Nate . ”
26354	26378	26321	26321	Bingley	143	“ That ’s because I am Nate . Nate ’s mind . The deep learning he ’s programmed is a very powerful thing . ”
26441	26453	26432	26432	I	113	“ Nate said I should ask you for anything I needed . ”
26454	26457	26407	26414	a British mash - up of my boss	875	“ Absolutely . ”
26458	26467	26432	26432	I	113	“ Open the pod bay doors , Hal . ”
26468	26478	26407	26414	a British mash - up of my boss	875	“ I ’ve heard that joke before , miss . ”
26486	26512	26479	26479	I	113	“ Bingley , I need you to play the Bruisers game . And I wo n’t look at the screen ; I ’ll just listen . ”
26513	26519	26432	26432	I	113	“ It ’s a deal . ”
26556	26578	26549	26551	the DC crowd	877	“ There you are , dear one . Kindly seat yourself where the blue light can not trouble your fair eyes . ”
26579	26588	26589	26589	He	879	“ Bingley , you ’re a good man . ”
26647	26651	26637	26637	I	113	“ All right , ”
26659	26665	26652	26652	I	113	“ Let the winning commence . ”
26838	26844	26845	26845	I	113	“ Life is so unfair , ”
26854	26857	26858	26858	Bingley	143	“ Indeed , ”
26861	26891	26858	26858	Bingley	143	“ The hit on Trevi should have drawn a penalty . But Nate ’s model shows we still have a sixty - seven percent chance of winning the game . ”
26896	26914	26892	26892	I	113	“ It ’s tied , Bingley . That means we both still have a fifty percent chance . ”
26915	26937	26938	26938	I	113	“ Not true . The model incorporates player stats in real time . And the Bruisers are dominating the puck control . ”
26975	26978	26979	26979	Bingley	143	“ GOAL ! ”
27034	27040	27041	27041	I	113	“ Do n’t celebrate yet ! ”
27044	27050	27041	27041	I	113	“ It ’s too soon ! ”
27051	27068	27069	27069	Bingley	143	“ We now show a ninety - four - point - seven percent chance of winning , ”
27072	27077	27069	27069	Bingley	143	“ YOU shut up . ”
27130	27137	27138	27138	I	113	“ I have to get better , ”
27146	27157	27138	27138	I	113	“ This sitting at home crap is n’t for me . ”
27169	27174	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Hey , Bingley . ”
27175	27180	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Yes , miss ? ”
27181	27191	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Can you give Nate a message for me ? ”
27192	27197	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Voice or text ? ”
27198	27210	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Uh , text . Tell him Rebecca sends her congratulations . ”
27211	27223	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Certainly , my dear . Are we adding any emojis ? ”
27224	27233	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ No , because we ’re not twelve . ”
27234	27237	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Noted . ”
27254	27260	27248	27248	I	113	“ Good night , Bingley . ”
27261	27278	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ Good night , miss . Shall I wake you for your doctor ’s appointment tomorrow ? ”
27279	27284	27248	27248	I	113	“ Sure . Thanks ! ”
27285	27306	27158	27158	Bingley	143	“ It ’s my pleasure . Nate has replied to your text . He reminds you to get some rest . ”
27705	27708	27709	27709	Rebecca	1114	“ Nate . ”
27721	27724	27725	27725	She	908	“ Yes ? ”
27923	27926	27927	27927	he	1114	“ Sorry , ”
27930	27935	27927	27927	he	1114	“ One more time ? ”
27942	27976	27936	27936	Becca	1114	“ The caller . On your line one . Someone from an NHL hockey team ? It does n’t sound like a call you ’d want to take , but the man insisted … ”
27977	27982	27983	27983	He	1114	“ Oh , shit . ”
27988	28008	27983	27983	He	1114	“ I did ask him to call today . Push back the next meeting for ten minutes , okay ? ”
28219	28224	28225	28225	she	908	“ A hockey team ? ”
28268	28280	28257	28257	He	1114	“ What do you think , Bec . You like hockey ? ”
28281	28301	28302	28302	She	908	“ I do , as a matter of fact . It ’s a fast moving game . No bullshit . ”
28305	28325	28302	28302	She	908	“ You used to have season tickets to the Rangers , right ? I guess you let those go ? ”
28362	28379	28423	28423	He	1114	“ The team I talked to today needs a little work . But I might invest . ”
28380	28383	28384	28384	Her	908	“ Really . ”
28389	28422	28384	28384	Her	908	“ That sounds like fun . If you buy a hockey team , I get to plan the celebration . With all those hunky hockey players . And puck - shaped food . ”
28443	28453	28423	28423	He	1114	“ Puck - shaped food ? Like … Oreos ? ”
28454	28465	28423	28423	He	1114	“ Pfft . Medallions of pork . Mini beef Wellingtons . ”
28466	28477	28423	28423	He	1114	“ Sushi rolls ? Fuck . Now I ’m hungry . ”
28526	28531	28532	28532	he	1114	“ There she is ! ”
28536	28539	28532	28532	he	1114	“ Ready ? ”
28576	28597	28573	28573	Nate	1114	“ The hotel has two towers . They can accommodate all of us , but not on the same side . ”
28719	28731	28732	28732	I	113	“ It should n’t be like this on a Sunday morning , ”
28746	28767	28735	28735	Lauren	91	“ Ramesh ca n’t get there any faster even if you tap your foot like an asshole the whole time . ”
28768	28776	28816	28816	she	91	“ Thank you , oh wise one . ”
28786	28810	28811	28811	Her	91	“ Listen up , would you ? Or do n’t , I do n’t care . But no bitching about the accommodations later . ”
28825	28838	28735	28735	Lauren	91	“ Just put us in suites . I do n’t care where . ”
28839	28845	28816	28816	she	91	“ You say that now … ”
28858	28886	28816	28816	she	91	“ Okay . I also added your tuxedo to your packing list . Can you think of anything else before I send this off to Mrs. Gray ? ”
28887	28912	28816	28816	she	91	“ Put a pair of swim trunks in there . Do n’t forget your suit . We ’re going to be on the beach . ”
28913	28940	28816	28816	she	91	“ You know , I do n’t actually want to go to Florida . How about you go without me and tell me how it was ? ”
28941	28952	28816	28816	she	91	“ Pack a suit , Lauren . You ’re going . ”
28990	29016	28987	28988	her ex	929	“ Not many owners would make their players do a black - tie benefit forty - eight hours before the next round of the playoffs . ”
29017	29034	29035	29035	I	113	“ It ’s pretty unusual for our players to make the second round of the playoffs , ”
29039	29063	29035	29035	I	113	“ They have to shake some hands for a couple of hours . They ’ll survive . It ’s for a good cause . ”
29064	29072	28987	28988	her ex	929	“ Why are we doing this again ? ”
29073	29126	29035	29035	I	113	“ Alex and I had a playoffs bet . My team made the playoffs , and hers did n’t , so she has to donate $ 1 million to charity . The black - tie event is to try to help her match it with other rich people ’s money in Florida . ”
29133	29152	29127	29127	Lauren	91	“ But what were you going to do if you both made the playoffs ? Or neither team ? ”
29153	29177	28987	28988	her ex	929	“ We ’d probably split it . Or get drunk on really expensive champagne and wonder why we ’d invested in sports teams . ”
29178	29184	29185	29185	Lauren	91	“ Because you love hockey ? ”
29188	29194	29195	29195	I	113	“ Because hockey is everything . ”
29253	29264	29245	29245	we	931	“ I ’m dropping you off at home , right ? ”
29265	29310	29326	29326	Lauren	91	“ Yes , please . But I ’ll rally after a couple hours . Do you want me to meet you at the office ? I will , so long as you realize it ’s Sunday . So I ’ll probably whine about it . ”
29311	29325	29245	29245	we	931	“ Save yourself the trouble . I ’m not going into the office . ”
29333	29353	29354	29354	She	91	“ Then why are we sharing a cab into Manhattan ? Are you lost ? Brooklyn is over there . ”
29363	29381	29326	29326	Lauren	91	“ I ’m headed downtown . Near City Hall . Rebecca has that appointment with the specialist . ”
29414	29431	29401	29401	Her	91	“ You have 2000 employees . Do you go to all of their doctors ’ appointments ? ”
29432	29446	29354	29354	She	91	“ Obviously not . That would be both time - consuming and awkward . ”
29447	29457	29401	29401	Her	91	“ Then why are you going to Rebecca ’s ? ”
29471	29517	29466	29466	my	113	“ Because I found her this doctor and I want to hear what he says . And because we ’ve known each other a long time . If you were sick and scared , I ’d show up at yours if you wanted me to . ”
29524	29535	29466	29466	my	113	“ I hope I never need that favor from you . ”
29536	29543	29466	29466	my	113	“ As do I , buddy . ”
29612	29618	29600	29600	he	629	“ You know , Nate … ”
29619	29622	29600	29600	he	629	“ Hmm ? ”
29635	29657	29630	29630	she	91	“ That was a good speech you gave the other day to the players . If not now , then when . ”
29658	29664	29665	29665	I	113	“ Not the most original , ”
29669	29676	29677	29677	She	91	“ It was heartfelt , though . ”
29687	29698	29677	29677	She	91	“ I especially liked the part about Why not me . ”
29699	29704	29705	29705	I	113	“ Well , really , ”
29708	29722	29705	29705	I	113	“ Why not us ? This team can take it all the way . ”
29723	29731	29782	29782	She	91	“ Sure . But what about you ? ”
29732	29737	29705	29705	I	113	“ What about me ? ”
29738	29746	29747	29747	She	91	“ If not now , then when ? ”
29752	29758	29747	29747	She	91	“ And why not you ? ”
29759	29781	29782	29782	She	91	“ I do n’t know what we ’re taking about now . And I was paying attention like a good boy . ”
29803	29833	29782	29782	She	91	“ I think you know what I mean . And if you do n’t , then I hope you ’ll figure it out soon . Give Rebecca my love . ”
30045	30049	30050	30050	I	113	“ Tell me , ”
30078	30084	30085	30085	she	91	“ He s - said … ”
30088	30097	30085	30085	she	91	“ H - he knows what ’s wrong . ”
30098	30101	30102	30102	I	113	“ And ? ”
30106	30115	30085	30085	she	91	“ And it ’s going to be okay . ”
30140	30145	30146	30146	I	113	“ That ’s good , ”
30150	30158	30146	30146	I	113	“ Then why are you so upset ? ”
30159	30164	30165	30165	She	91	“ B - because … ”
30178	30214	30165	30165	She	91	“ Nobody said that before ! They said , ‘ We do n’t know why your injury does n’t behave like a concussion . Just go home and wait . ’ But Doctor Armitage said … ”
30215	30222	30230	30230	I	113	“ It ’s a vestibular problem ! ”
30266	30298	30254	30254	I	113	“ The concussion is n’t the issue anymore . When Rebecca hit the ice , she disturbed some of the nerves in her ear . Normal sensory processing is temporarily scrambled . ”
30299	30302	30303	30303	I	113	“ Oh . ”
30311	30323	30303	30303	I	113	“ It ’s rarer than a concussion . But not worse . ”
30333	30354	30355	30355	He	135	“ That ’s right . She ’s going to have to put a lot of effort into her therapy here — ”
30373	30420	30355	30355	He	135	“ She needs to train her body and brain to communicate efficiently again . My therapists will help her work on balance and coordination . In a few weeks she ’ll see some improvement , and in a few months she will make a full recovery . ”
30436	30445	30430	30430	she	950	“ I ca n’t wait to get started . ”
30446	30452	30453	30453	He	135	“ The day after tomorrow . ”
30461	30548	30549	30550	The doctor	629	“ We ’ll set you up with a trainer . Sessions are ninety minutes . In the meantime , you ’re going to take good care of yourself . You can be as active as you wish , but you need a good eight or ten hours of sleep . And limited screen time . No blue light after sundown . Set your phone to the warm light setting , and do n’t look at it much until you ’re seeing some improvement in your symptoms . ”
30555	30591	30549	30550	The doctor	629	“ If you two have a TV in your bedroom , it needs to stay off for a few weeks . Most couples can usually find better things to do with the time , anyway . ”
30613	30616	30617	30617	I	113	“ Um … ”
30658	30668	30669	30670	The doctor	629	“ … Three sessions a week for ninety minutes . ”
30676	30698	30669	30670	The doctor	629	“ We ’ll take baseline measurements first , and then we ’ll get right to work . Pleasure meeting you both . ”
30714	30717	30718	30718	Rebecca	1114	“ Wow . ”
30726	30737	30718	30718	Rebecca	1114	“ I am so relieved . You have no idea . ”
30738	30752	30718	30718	Rebecca	1114	“ It ’s great news , Bec . You ready to head home ? ”
30821	30829	30830	30830	she	957	“ Are you going into the office ? ”
30861	30890	30891	30891	Rebecca	1114	“ No . It ’s Sunday . I ’ll take the day off for a change . Besides , it ’s time for lunch . I ’m starving . ”
30894	30904	30905	30905	She	957	“ Let ’s find you some lunch . Sushi ? ”
30950	30957	30958	30958	I	113	“ Let ’s walk a ways , ”
30961	30984	30958	30958	I	113	“ Find a food truck , maybe ? It ’s a nice day and I ’ve been on a plane all morning . ”
30992	30998	30958	30958	I	113	“ Where ’s your stuff ? ”
30999	31010	31011	31011	I	113	“ In the car with Ramesh . Hey — look . ”
31020	31028	31011	31011	I	113	“ How do you feel about falafel ? ”
31029	31037	31038	31038	she	957	“ Let ’s see how it looks , ”
31041	31057	31038	31038	she	957	“ A good falafel is heaven . An indifferent falafel is a waste of carbs . ”
31188	31197	31176	31176	I	113	“ Want to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge ? ”
31208	31211	31212	31212	She	957	“ Sure ! ”
31223	31240	31212	31212	She	957	“ Walking and eating , though . I have enough trouble with coordination as it is . ”
31257	31270	31271	31271	she	957	“ Do n’t you have to tell Ramesh where you ’ve gone ? ”
31317	31328	31303	31303	She	957	“ I thought you were n’t supposed to use screens ? ”
31329	31332	31333	31333	she	957	“ Much , ”
31337	31374	31333	31333	she	957	“ But now I ’m not following the concussion protocol , so it ’s a little different . Reading books is okay again . Blue light after dark is the only thing I ca n’t have . ”
31417	31425	31426	31426	she	957	“ Hey — thanks for the audiobooks , ”
31430	31437	31426	31426	she	957	“ That was a lovely idea . ”
31438	31443	31408	31408	We	963	“ You ’re welcome . ”
31444	31488	31426	31426	she	957	“ I also listened to the game . I had to turn my back to your TV so I would n’t be tempted to watch . When Trevi got that fourth goal I shrieked so loudly that Bingley asked if I was okay . ”
31489	31492	31408	31408	We	963	“ Yeah ? ”
31508	31523	31408	31408	We	963	“ That ’s funny . Did you notice Bingley taking any other wrong cues ? ”
31538	31553	31578	31580	a funny guy	971	“ He was a perfect gentleman . I sneezed and he said bless you . ”
31554	31565	31566	31576	The young programmer who ’s working on the product with me	970	“ Yeah ? That ’s classy . Go , Bingley . ”
31622	31642	31611	31611	Rebecca	1114	“ Congratulations , Nate . Seriously . That game was amazing . I ’m so happy you ’re advancing . ”
31643	31650	31651	31651	I	113	“ I did n’t win it , ”
31661	31674	31651	31651	I	113	“ But it sure was fun to watch . Ready to walk ? ”
31675	31679	31611	31611	Rebecca	1114	“ Sure thing . ”
31771	31783	31784	31784	Rebecca	1114	“ I ’m doing three sessions a week with the trainers , ”
31788	31845	31784	31784	Rebecca	1114	“ Doctor Armitage said that the first few will really wipe me out , but that I should n’t get discouraged . He ’s never had a vestibular patient who could n’t improve a lot with therapy — unless something else is also wrong . But he does n’t think that ’s the case with me . ”
31846	31856	31921	31921	She	979	“ Okay . I like the sound of that . ”
31857	31880	31784	31784	Rebecca	1114	“ Me too ! I could be back to work soon . He said we ’d talk about it in two weeks . ”
31896	31909	31910	31910	Becca	1114	“ I was thinking I could go part - time at first , ”
31913	31920	31921	31921	She	979	“ See what the doctor says . ”
31929	31964	31921	31921	She	979	“ Do n’t kill my buzz , Nate . Oh — and speaking of buzzes — the no - alcohol rule is still in force . Apparently vestibular systems can be confused by alcohol . ”
31965	31977	31921	31921	She	979	“ I could have told you that . Tequila , especially . ”
31994	32013	31989	31989	I	113	“ Tell me about this party Mrs. Gray is packing for . Bal Harbour ? It sounds glam . ”
32014	32047	32061	32061	She	979	“ Alex planned it . If glam is the same thing as Alex making me wear a tux , then I guess it is . Fucking bow ties . I hate them . ”
32048	32060	32061	32061	She	979	“ That ’s only because you still ca n’t tie one . ”
32086	32102	32080	32080	I	113	“ I can too tie a bow tie . I just do n’t enjoy it . ”
32103	32122	32123	32123	She	979	“ Here ’s a deal for you — I’ll tie the bow tie for you . In Florida . ”
32126	32146	32123	32123	She	979	“ On a beach . I ca n’t believe I ’m missing this party . The universe hates me . ”
32147	32168	32080	32080	I	113	“ It ’s too bad . I could use the company . You have to go to therapy , though . ”
32169	32210	32211	32211	Her	979	“ Nope . I took someone ’s cancellation for Tuesday , but then they ca n’t get me in until Thursday . What do you mean you could use the company ? I could be an extra set of hands ! ”
32219	32235	32211	32211	Her	979	“ It ’s been weeks since I saw everyone . I feel like a hermit . ”
32236	32242	32243	32243	I	113	“ Then you should come , ”
32248	32260	32243	32243	I	113	“ Lauren told me to bring a date to this benefit . ”
32261	32267	32268	32268	Becca	1114	“ A date ? Really ? ”
32288	32308	32309	32309	I	113	“ What for ? I do n’t know if I ’d be any good at asking people for donations . ”
32314	32353	32309	32309	I	113	“ That ’s not the reason at all . I need the cocktail hour to be a social event . Your only job would be to shut down any business chatter on an M&A deal I ’m considering . ”
32363	32368	32369	32369	She	792	“ Oh , okay . ”
32375	32392	32369	32369	She	792	“ I really want to go . But I already owe you in so many ways . ”
32393	32396	32397	32397	I	113	“ Bullshit , ”
32401	32417	32397	32397	I	113	“ You do n’t owe me a thing , okay ? Do n’t say that . ”
32442	32476	32428	32428	I	113	“ Come to Florida . Sit on the beach for a day with Georgia . Visit the land of the living . Then get yourself back here in time for your therapy appointments . ”
32477	32480	32481	32481	She	792	“ Yay ! ”
32487	32527	32481	32481	She	792	“ I need to do a deep dive into my closet . This will be fun . How dressy is this party ? I ’m trying to picture tuxes on a beach . Sounds a little like a wedding . ”
32528	32535	32557	32557	She	792	“ Dumbest thing I ever heard . ”
32539	32556	32536	32536	Becca	1114	“ I ’ll ask Georgia what to wear . I ca n’t wait to see her . ”
32573	32578	32557	32557	She	792	“ I got you ! ”
32609	32624	32595	32595	His	983	“ Come on , Miss Rowley . Keep those eyes closed and start jumping . ”
32776	32781	32782	32782	Ramón	195	“ Come on now , ”
32791	32799	32786	32786	He	195	“ Close those eyes , Miss Rowley . ”
32800	32805	32806	32806	I	113	“ Call me Becca , ”
32811	32834	32786	32786	He	195	“ Jump , Becca . Bounce your butt in the air before I make you stay after school for disobeying the teacher . ”
32925	32932	32933	32933	he	195	“ So this is going well , ”
32940	32955	32956	32956	I	113	“ Ca n’t we go back to the walking ? Or the balance beam ? ”
33021	33030	33031	33031	he	195	“ Nope ! Let ’s finish up here , ”
33039	33062	33031	33031	he	195	“ But , hey , let ’s have you bounce for a moment with your eyes open . Just try that much . ”
33141	33146	33147	33147	Ramón	195	“ That ’s it , ”
33150	33160	33147	33147	Ramón	195	“ Pick a gaze point . You feel solid ? ”
33161	33165	33147	33147	Ramón	195	“ Solid enough . ”
33201	33214	33194	33194	Ramón	195	“ Okay , Becca . Close your eyes and bounce five times . ”
33239	33250	33231	33231	Ramón	195	“ You ’ve got this . Just a couple more . ”
33306	33315	33298	33298	I	113	“ The trampoline is trying to kill me . ”
33316	33339	33276	33276	He	195	“ No , it is n’t . Trampolines are fun . We ’ll have you bouncing like a pro in no time . ”
33366	33372	33373	33373	I	113	“ Is my time up ? ”
33377	33404	33298	33298	I	113	“ We have five more minutes . Come over here . This part is easy — all you have to do is sit in a chair . ”
33405	33429	33430	33430	Ramón	195	“ That ’s something I ’ve always been good at . Especially if there ’s wine and a Channing Tatum movie on TV . ”
33433	33458	33459	33459	He	195	“ Wine is a bad idea , Miss Rebecca . Give your body a couple more weeks to find its balance before you indulge . ”
33473	33496	33298	33298	I	113	“ You ’d better not tell me that Channing Tatum is bad for my recovery . Or I ’m out of here . ”
33497	33527	33586	33586	Ramón	195	“ That male stripper movie , right ? My girlfriend loves it . If Channing Tatum wanted to bounce on the trampoline with you , would you say yes ? ”
33528	33534	33298	33298	I	113	“ You know I would . ”
33535	33555	33586	33586	Ramón	195	“ Then I ’ll give that man a call to see if he ’s available for your next session . ”
33603	33612	33613	33613	I	113	“ Oh my God . I hate you , ”
33641	33648	33649	33649	He	195	“ No , you do n’t . ”
33695	33701	33685	33685	he	195	“ How do you feel ? ”
33702	33707	33685	33685	he	195	“ Dizzy ! Duh . ”
33716	33726	33708	33708	He	195	“ Tell me when you ’re no longer dizzy . ”
33777	33786	33758	33758	I	113	“ Now . The room has stopped moving . ”
33787	33793	33794	33794	Ramón	195	“ Fifty - five seconds , ”
33803	33830	33794	33794	Ramón	195	“ A normal vestibular system will have you recovered after ten seconds . So that ’s our goal . Ten seconds . We ’ll get there . ”
33850	33883	33842	33842	I	113	“ Is that it for now , tough guy ? Because I have a party to attend , where I get to wear a dress for the first time in a month . ”
33889	33922	33884	33884	He	195	“ Go get ‘ em , Rebecca . Have a great time . But do n’t drink , unless you want to feel worse than the spinning chair just made you feel . ”
33923	33927	33928	33928	I	113	“ Got it ! ”
33954	33961	33928	33928	I	113	“ See you on the flipside . ”
34123	34138	34109	34109	I	113	“ Where can I drop my stuff so we can play on the beach ? ”
34139	34152	34109	34109	I	113	“ I have your room key . You can go right up . ”
34153	34161	34109	34109	I	113	“ I ’m not bunking with you ? ”
34162	34182	34183	34183	Her	994	“ Not this time . It ’s not a game night , so I get to bunk with Leo . ”
34222	34236	34219	34219	I	113	“ Nate added you to the hotel list . You get room 404 . ”
34237	34251	34212	34212	Nate	1114	“ Huh . I did n’t ask Nate to get me a room . ”
34252	34259	34219	34219	I	113	“ He got you one anyway . ”
34266	34296	34297	34297	Plus	199	“ I did n’t let him buy my plane ticket , though . Since I ’m not really here in an official capacity , that would just be weird . ”
34343	34355	34323	34323	He	1114	“ Stop worrying . You brought a bathing suit , right ? ”
34356	34385	34323	34323	He	1114	“ Yes ma’am . And some heavy - duty sunblock . Let ’s go sit on a towel and gossip . I have n’t seen you in ages . ”
34463	34474	34475	34475	Georgia	95	“ What ’s it like staying at Nate ’s house ? ”
34478	34515	34475	34475	Georgia	95	“ Strange . Like playing house in a mansion . He and I went out for sushi the other night . Mrs. Gray does n’t work on Sunday and Nate never goes into his kitchen alone . ”
34516	34525	34541	34541	Georgia	95	“ Does he even know where it is ? ”
34526	34540	34475	34475	Georgia	95	“ Of course , because that ’s where the Diet Coke is kept . ”
34544	34561	34541	34541	Georgia	95	“ That house must just echo . Is it weird spending time like that with him ? ”
34567	34628	34562	34562	I	113	“ Yes and no . Nate and I used to spend a whole lot of time together . On planes . In hotels and conference rooms on the road . All those early trips to Silicon Valley and even Asia , before he had a big entourage . We always stuck together because we ’d be in a strange place . ”
34637	34660	34629	34630	My friend	1000	“ I always forget that you used to spend your whole week with him . That sounds like a real bonding experience . ”
34661	34714	34629	34630	My friend	1000	“ It was . Honestly , the only thing weird about hanging around with him at home is that it ’s not that weird . It ’s like … It ’s made me miss him . Which makes no sense . But those were good days . We made a good team . ”
34715	34718	34719	34719	Georgia	95	“ Mmm . ”
34726	34750	34719	34719	Georgia	95	“ I get it . That was special . Not everybody can say she was Nate Kattenberger ’s sidekick for five straight years . ”
34751	34789	34719	34719	Georgia	95	“ He was n’t the famous CEO of KTech back then . He was just a guy who could n’t unjam the printer without my help . But he told really good jokes . He was fun . ”
34819	34826	34827	34827	I	113	“ You know what ’s crazy ? ”
34833	34877	34827	34827	I	113	“ When things go wrong , Nate never yells . He ’s hard to impress , but you ca n’t freak him out , either . I do n’t think I really appreciated that until I went to work for the hockey team . ”
34878	34886	34887	34887	Georgia	95	“ Hugh is a little more volatile , ”
34898	34973	34974	34974	I	113	“ He ’s fine . But he panics sometimes , like a normal person . He yells now and then . But Nate is like a stone in the river . Everything rushes past , but he is n’t swayed . I think that ’s why I ’ve felt calmer since I went to stay with him . He keeps telling me everything is going to be okay , and I believe him because … ”
34981	34994	34974	34974	I	113	“ Because he ’s smarter than anyone else we ’ll ever meet ? ”
34995	35000	35002	35002	I	113	“ Yeah . Sure . ”
35036	35049	35050	35050	Georgia	95	“ It ’s almost time to get dolled up for this party , ”
35054	35083	35050	35050	Georgia	95	“ Is it okay with you if we get ready in Lauren ’s suite ? She asked us to come up . There ’s snacks , I think . ”
35084	35091	35050	35050	Georgia	95	“ Sure ? Snacks are nice . ”
35117	35129	35108	35108	she	95	“ Since when does Lauren want to pal around with us ? ”
35133	35161	35130	35130	Georgia	95	“ I ’m not sure Lauren is the superbitch we think she is . Did you know that she and Mike Beacon used to be a couple ? ”
35162	35165	35130	35130	Georgia	95	“ No ! ”
35166	35170	35130	35130	Georgia	95	“ True story . ”
35171	35181	35130	35130	Georgia	95	“ Mike Beacon ? I ca n’t picture that . ”
35188	35198	35130	35130	Georgia	95	“ Lauren always says how much she hates hockey . ”
35199	35202	35203	35203	Georgia	95	“ Yeah . ”
35207	35235	35203	35203	Georgia	95	“ I ’m pretty sure she only started hating hockey after Mike Beacon dumped her over the phone to move back in with his ex - wife . ”
35236	35239	35130	35130	Georgia	95	“ Whoa ! ”
35263	35272	35253	35253	I	113	“ Wait — when did they break up ? ”
35273	35287	35240	35240	We	1008	“ Two years ago , right around the time Nate bought the Bruisers . ”
35288	35299	35253	35253	I	113	“ Right at the moment when Lauren got my job . ”
35359	35368	35369	35369	Georgia	95	“ I was thinking about this , too , ”
35372	35412	35369	35369	Georgia	95	“ Is it possible that Nate factored her breakup in to swapping your jobs ? Maybe he knew Lauren was a good employee , but that she ’d quit if he did n’t get her out of that office . ”
35413	35418	35419	35419	I	113	“ That’s … interesting , ”
35422	35428	35419	35419	I	113	“ But kind of farfetched . ”
35429	35432	35433	35433	Georgia	95	“ Maybe , ”
35440	35455	35433	35433	Georgia	95	“ I know it ’s always bothered you that Nate sent you to Brooklyn . ”
35456	35466	35471	35471	Nate	1114	“ Yeah . I probably wo n’t ever understand . ”
35478	35482	35471	35471	Nate	1114	“ lateral move , ”
35664	35668	35657	35657	her	91	“ Hi there . ”
35669	35703	35704	35704	I	113	“ I see that look of excitement on your face . But , sadly , I ’m not back in action yet . My fancy new doctor has outlined several weeks of therapy . ”
35725	35766	35704	35704	I	113	“ I whined so loudly that Nate agreed to a temporary furlough . I ’ve been let out for good behavior for this party so long as I ’m back at the therapist ’s office in forty - eight hours . ”
35767	35770	35771	35771	Lauren	91	“ Oh . ”
35776	35799	35771	35771	Lauren	91	“ Ah , well . I guess I have to go to this fucking party after all . Somebody open the wine . ”
35816	35822	35823	35823	Georgia	95	“ How are you feeling ? ”
35834	35876	35881	35883	my best friend	397	“ Right now ? I feel great . I ’m sitting here eating overpriced hotel food , and I just painted your toes a kickass shade of pink . But sometimes I get all squinty and the room tends to spin . ”
35877	35880	35881	35883	my best friend	397	“ Bummer , ”
35890	35923	35881	35883	my best friend	397	“ It really is . But I like my new doctor , and I feel really hopeful that they know what to do . I ’m so tired of being a drag . ”
35924	35931	35932	35932	Georgia	95	“ You ’re never a drag , ”
35936	35943	35932	35932	Georgia	95	“ If only that were true . ”
35944	35953	35954	35954	she	397	“ Is it weird being away from work ? ”
35957	35994	35932	35932	Georgia	95	“ So weird . I feel like maybe they ’ll just forget about me and hire someone else . Did n’t we used to have someone at that desk ? Better put someone in that spot . ”
35995	36004	36005	36005	Ari	200	“ What ’s it like staying with Nate ? ”
36009	36023	36005	36005	Ari	200	“ He ’s probably never home , I guess . Except to sleep . ”
36024	36044	36045	36045	Georgia	95	“ Maybe ? But I ’m in his private lair . He ca n’t walk around naked or whatever . ”
36048	36062	36045	36045	Georgia	95	“ If you see him naked , I want details . That body . ”
36069	36086	36063	36063	Heat	203	“ Stop it . I try not to sit around thinking about Nate ’s naked body . ”
36131	36141	36142	36142	Georgia	95	“ Why not ? Everyone has a naked body , ”
36146	36157	36142	36142	Georgia	95	“ Even the guy wearing the eight hundred dollar sneakers . ”
36178	36247	36142	36142	Georgia	95	“ But we do n’t have to picture it . That ’s dangerous . If I indulge in that kind of curiosity , some day we ’ll be sitting in a meeting with the marketing department , and I ’ll be picturing Naked Nate . And someone will turn to me and ask a question about ticket sales , and I ’ll probably answer , ‘ biceps . ’ ”
36248	36255	36256	36256	Georgia	95	“ He has really nice biceps , ”
36259	36262	36263	36263	I	113	“ Stop , ”
36299	36312	36313	36313	Lauren	91	“ Becca — it ’s your turn to show us your dress , ”
36346	36354	36355	36355	I	113	“ It ’s a vintage 1950s strapless . ”
36380	36383	36384	36384	Georgia	95	“ Wow ! ”
36387	36401	36384	36384	Georgia	95	“ I ’m glad you decided it was time to wear that one . ”
36402	36408	36409	36409	I	113	“ I know , right ? ”
36416	36452	36409	36409	I	113	“ I hope it ’s dressy enough . Nate asked me to have drinks with him before this shindig starts . He ’s meeting his old friend before the party starts , and he says … ”
36470	36493	36409	36409	I	113	“ Stick close because I do n’t want to talk business . Alex wants to pick my pocket on the router division . ”
36497	36512	36494	36494	Lauren	91	“ Oh , Nate . Way to handle it like a grown - up . ”
36513	36523	36524	36524	I	113	“ I met Alex once a long time ago , ”
36537	36564	36528	36528	I	113	“ Do you think Nate has a thing for her ? Is there another angle here ? Am I supposed to make her jealous or something ? ”
36565	36568	36569	36569	Lauren	91	“ No ! ”
36573	36610	36569	36569	Lauren	91	“ There ’s nothing between those two . Nate does n’t want to get an offer from Alex on the router division because he thinks he can get a better deal if someone else offers first . ”
36611	36616	36656	36657	My friend	91	“ Oh , okay … ”
36619	36655	36656	36657	My friend	91	“ Tonight just got so much less interesting than I thought it was . Too bad I ’m not supposed to drink . Georgia — come here , honey . Let me fix your mascara . ”
36661	36668	36656	36657	My friend	91	“ Did I goof it up ? ”
36669	36689	36704	36704	she	91	“ Not yet , baby doll . But you ’re probably going to . Let Auntie Becca do that . ”
36690	36698	36699	36699	Georgia	95	“ You have no confidence in me ! ”
36711	36728	36729	36729	I	113	“ I have every confidence in you ! Except when it comes to fashion and makeup . ”
36945	36949	36950	36950	Lauren	91	“ You know … ”
36958	37019	36950	36950	Lauren	91	“ Maybe you ’re on to something . Occasionally I get a vibe off of Alex , like she might have a thing for Nate . But I could be wrong . And lord knows Nate might not even notice . That man is pretty sharp about everyone ’s motivations , and a total dunce when it comes to himself . ”
37039	37049	37020	37020	She	91	“ Did you ever meet Juliet , his ex ? ”
37050	37055	37056	37056	Lauren	91	“ No ! You ? ”
37085	37138	37069	37069	She	91	“ Of course I did . She was around a lot in the early days . Nate did n’t travel as much the first year I worked with him , and their offices were walking distance apart . She would bring by dinner for him sometimes . They were a cute couple . ”
37144	37156	37157	37157	Lauren	91	“ It ’s hard to picture Nate as half a couple , ”
37160	37166	37167	37167	I	113	“ He was , though , ”
37178	37212	37167	37167	I	113	“ He was devoted — the kind of fiancé who wants to help plan the wedding . They were going with a Doctor Who theme , with TARDIS on top of the cake … ”
37295	37299	37300	37300	Georgia	95	“ Hold this ? ”
37316	37329	37330	37330	she	91	“ God , I hate heels . How do you do it ? ”
37334	37348	37366	37366	Nate	1114	“ I ’m a short girl . I ’ve been practicing since puberty . ”
37371	37374	37366	37366	Nate	1114	“ Lauren ? ”
37375	37379	37380	37380	she	91	“ Hang on ! ”
37389	37395	37396	37396	I	113	“ We need a minute ! ”
37399	37405	37396	37396	I	113	“ We ’re not decent ! ”
37434	37438	37439	37439	Lauren	91	“ Come in , ”
37481	37504	37478	37478	he	1114	“ I ’ve been on the phone with Silicon Valley all day . Did n’t know there was a party next door . ”
37505	37512	37513	37513	I	113	“ You poor , poor thing , ”
37528	37547	37516	37516	I	113	“ Did you really just knock on Lauren ’s door because you ca n’t tie a bow tie ? ”
37557	37562	37554	37554	he	1114	“ I hate tuxes . ”
37573	37583	37563	37563	His	1114	“ I thought you were n’t supposed to drink ? ”
37606	37621	37598	37598	Georgia	95	“ She ’s holding that for me so I could try on these shoes . ”
37622	37630	37631	37631	I	113	“ That ’s the truth , officer , ”
37634	37645	37631	37631	I	113	“ Now come closer so I can do this right . ”
37720	37728	37729	37729	I	113	“ So , about this thing tonight , ”
37756	37772	37746	37746	Nate	1114	“ Am I your buffer for the whole evening ? Or just the beginning part ? ”
37773	37778	37779	37779	he	1114	“ Just for drinks , ”
37786	37807	37779	37779	he	1114	“ Alex ca n’t buttonhole me all evening . She ’ll have to work the room for her charitable cause . ”
37808	37811	37812	37812	I	113	“ Awesome ! ”
37840	37857	37833	37833	I	113	“ I want to dance with basketball players . They ’re probably quick on their feet . ”
37861	37871	37858	37858	Nate	1114	“ It ’s almost time to meet Alex downstairs . ”
37872	37885	37886	37886	I	113	“ I know , slave driver . Let me grab my clutch . ”
37898	37908	37886	37886	I	113	“ Can I leave my things here for now ? ”
37918	37922	37923	37923	Lauren	91	“ Of course , ”
37927	37931	37923	37923	Lauren	91	“ Have fun . ”
37987	37993	37980	37980	I	113	“ Cheer up , boss , ”
38003	38024	37997	37997	Nate	1114	“ We ’re at a beach , and my handbag sparkles . It ’s going to be a good night . ”
38029	38053	38025	38025	His	1114	“ Fine . I ’ll try to have a good time . I have n’t seen Alex in a couple months , anyway . ”
38054	38058	38025	38025	His	1114	“ Why not ? ”
38059	38062	38063	38063	He	1114	“ Busy . ”
38066	38083	38063	38063	He	1114	“ Her office is twenty blocks from mine . But we have n’t made the time . ”
38275	38279	38280	38280	Nate	1114	“ Everything okay ? ”
38296	38307	38291	38291	I	113	“ Totally fine . This is just a temporary setback . ”
38487	38504	38484	38484	us	1056	“ Good evening , sir . The event manager is just inside if you need anything . ”
38505	38509	38510	38510	Nate	1114	“ Thank you , ”
38545	38549	38510	38510	Nate	1114	“ infinite edge , ”
38692	38696	38697	38697	she	130	“ Hey stranger , ”
38721	38724	38725	38725	He	1114	“ Hey ! ”
38731	38736	38725	38725	He	1114	“ You remember Rebecca ? ”
38747	38755	38737	38737	Alex	130	“ Oh . Rebecca . The receptionist . ”
38756	38760	38761	38761	I	113	“ Office manager , ”
38808	38819	38820	38820	I	113	“ I run the Brooklyn Bruisers ’ offices these days , ”
38829	38833	38834	38834	She	130	“ I see . ”
38840	38873	38834	38834	She	130	“ That explains why I have n’t seen you in a while . But now I remember — Nate moved you to Brooklyn and promoted Lauren Williams . Great girl , Lauren . ”
38874	38877	38878	38878	I	113	“ Right , ”
38889	38895	38878	38878	I	113	“ She ’s the best . ”
38925	38944	38916	38916	I	113	“ Rebecca has had a rough couple of weeks . I invited her tonight to cheer her up . ”
38945	38948	38949	38949	Alex	130	“ Oh ? ”
38967	38971	38972	38972	Nate	1114	“ Head injury , ”
38975	39004	38972	38972	Nate	1114	“ Did you know the inner ear can be knocked out of whack ? The treatment plan involves time on a trampoline and spinning in an office chair . ”
39005	39009	39010	39010	Alex	130	“ How stimulating , ”
39080	39086	39061	39061	He	1114	“ What are you drinking ? ”
39134	39141	39142	39142	she	130	“ I ’m good for now , ”
39145	39161	39162	39162	she	130	“ But there are specialty cocktails for our event . You might want to try … ”
39171	39198	39162	39162	she	130	“ The Brooklyn Bubbly . Champagne , apricot nectar , and orange blossom water . There ’s a cute cocktail named after each of our teams . ”
39199	39203	39204	39204	Nate	1114	“ Until tomorrow , ”
39212	39230	39204	39204	Nate	1114	“ Tomorrow night they ’ll just name the same drink after some other rich guy ’s hobby . ”
39236	39249	39231	39231	Alex	130	“ It ’s too early in the evening to be that cynical . ”
39250	39261	39262	39262	He	1114	“ It ’s never too early to be this cynical . ”
39271	39277	39278	39278	Alex	130	“ You clean up nice , ”
39291	39301	39282	39282	She	130	“ Is the bow tie a clip - on ? ”
39302	39307	39308	39308	I	113	“ Of course not ! ”
39311	39316	39308	39308	I	113	“ I tied it . ”
39400	39413	39392	39392	Nate	1114	“ Hey , Bec ! They have that ginger beer you like . ”
39463	39473	39474	39474	she	130	“ I got you through that French poetry class , ”
39477	39481	39474	39474	she	130	“ Admit it . ”
39482	39487	39506	39506	Nate	1114	“ That you did . ”
39738	39745	39746	39746	she	130	“ God , that was dumb , ”
39756	39762	39746	39746	she	130	“ What were we thinking ? ”
39828	39837	39838	39838	I	113	“ Did n’t you bring a date tonight ? ”
39848	39852	39838	39838	I	113	“ Where ’s … ”
39928	39932	39933	39933	she	130	“ … Jared ? ”
39942	39958	39937	39937	she	130	“ I tossed him overboard last month . It ’s not going to work out . ”
39959	39964	39965	39965	I	113	“ I ’m sorry , ”
40074	40087	40068	40068	She	130	“ No big deal . There ’s other fish in the sea . ”
40107	40125	40096	40096	I	113	“ Another ginger ale , Bec ? And you never did tell me what you were drinking . ”
40133	40157	40096	40096	I	113	“ Just a club soda , please . I need to stay sharp so I can hustle money from rich , older men . ”
40158	40171	40179	40179	Rebecca	1114	“ I ’m pretty sure you could do that drunk or sober . ”
40172	40175	40176	40176	She	130	“ Thanks . ”
40234	40258	40259	40259	She	130	“ A ship carrying blue paint and a ship carrying red paint both crashed on an island . All the sailors were marooned . ”
40262	40269	40259	40259	She	130	“ Another Bingley special , right ? ”
40270	40273	40274	40274	She	130	“ Indeed . ”
40522	40533	40534	40534	she	130	“ I want to feel the sand between my toes , ”
40537	40549	40534	40534	she	130	“ Shall we take a little walk before the ticketholders arrive ? ”
40550	40555	40556	40556	Alex	130	“ Why ’s that ? ”
40564	40585	40534	40534	she	130	“ We ’re at the beach . If I ’m near the ocean , I want to actually see it . ”
40586	40593	40594	40594	Alex	130	“ Brooklyn is near the ocean , ”
40616	40638	40639	40639	She	130	“ You know , I passed the fourth grade , too . But my desk does n’t overlook the Far Rockaways . ”
40663	40670	40671	40671	She	130	“ Ah , that ’s it . ”
40763	40775	40776	40776	Becca	1114	“ This is the best bar I ’ve ever been to , ”
40825	40830	40831	40831	I	113	“ Are you cold ? ”
40844	40859	40860	40860	Alex	130	“ Not cold enough to ruin the line of this dress with a wrap . ”
40863	40877	40860	40860	Alex	130	“ It ’s great to be out of the office , I suppose . ”
40878	40891	40892	40892	Rebecca	1114	“ Actually , it would be great to be in the office . ”
40897	40927	40892	40892	Rebecca	1114	“ I am on sick leave right now . It ’s the pits . Nate invited me to this shindig because I have a bad case of cabin fever . ”
40928	40931	40932	40932	Alex	130	“ Right . ”
40951	40962	40944	40944	I	113	“ How long have you been working in Brooklyn now ? ”
40963	40967	40968	40968	Rebecca	1114	“ Two years , ”
40982	40989	40990	40990	Alex	130	“ Is it that long already ? ”
41013	41019	41000	41000	I	113	“ Do you like Brooklyn ? ”
41020	41024	41025	41025	Becca	1114	“ Love it , ”
41029	41079	41025	41025	Becca	1114	“ The hockey team is a lot of fun . And our setup in DUMBO is pretty great . Everyone lives nearby , and I ’ve really gotten to know all the vendors we work with . It ’s like a small town in the middle of the city . ”
41080	41086	41087	41087	Alex	130	“ That does sound nice , ”
41090	41114	41087	41087	Alex	130	“ Someone is waving at you , honey . I guess they ’re letting people in now . Time to hustle for charity . ”
41131	41137	41138	41138	he	1011	“ Look who ’s here ! ”
41141	41145	41146	41147	another player	1108	“ No way ! ”
41150	41157	41146	41147	another player	1108	“ Becca ! We missed you ! ”
41161	41170	41158	41158	Rebecca	1114	“ Do you mind if I say hello ? ”
41171	41174	41175	41175	I	113	“ Go , ”
41185	41204	41205	41205	Alex	130	“ I ’m not going to pick his pocket on the router division in the next two minutes , ”
41211	41220	41205	41205	Alex	130	“ Even I ca n’t work that fast . ”
41250	41253	41254	41254	Alex	130	“ Hey , ”
41261	41264	41254	41254	Alex	130	“ Romeo . ”
41273	41276	41267	41267	me	113	“ What ? ”
41297	41313	41283	41283	she	1109	“ I swear to God , Nate . Does that girl know how you feel ? ”
41322	41343	41316	41316	Alex	130	“ Seriously ? I hope you were n’t actually trying to keep it a secret . Your poker face sucks . ”
41344	41353	41314	41314	Shit	213	“ I do n’t often lose at poker . ”
41366	41391	41363	41363	her	1109	“ Do n’t play when she ’s at the table , then . I do n’t think you could even see your own cards . ”
41409	41424	41399	41399	My	113	“ It does n’t matter , anyway . Nothing is going to happen there . ”
41425	41429	41430	41430	Ugh	214	“ Why not ? ”
41443	41455	41430	41430	Ugh	214	“ She ’s an employee . It would be completely improper . ”
41476	41480	41481	41481	Alex	130	“ I see . ”
41509	41549	41486	41486	she	130	“ But how can you live like this ? I ’ve met puppies more subtle than you are . That ’s why you sent her to Brooklyn , right ? To try to get her out of your head . ”
41550	41553	41554	41554	I	113	“ Whatever , ”
41565	41571	41554	41554	I	113	“ It did n’t work . ”
41575	41596	41572	41572	Alex	130	“ You ’re a really smart man , Nate . But you do n’t know everything . Especially about women . ”
41619	41629	41630	41630	Alex	130	“ We ’re not all Juliet , you know , ”
41634	41639	41641	41641	I	113	“ Gosh , really ? ”
41660	41667	41677	41677	she	1116	“ I know that , Al . ”
41668	41676	41677	41677	she	1116	“ I ’m not sure you do , ”
41688	41715	41677	41677	she	1116	“ Juliet did a number on you . She basically convinced you that no woman would find you attractive if it were n’t for your money . ”
41716	41722	41723	41723	I	113	“ That ’s not true , ”
41726	41742	41723	41723	I	113	“ It ’s just that the ones I like do n’t seem to notice me . ”
41764	41767	41768	41768	I	113	“ Alex , ”
41771	41785	41768	41768	I	113	“ Is there something you needed to talk about ? I ’ll listen . ”
41793	41803	41786	41786	She	1116	“ Too late . Another time , I guess . ”
41812	41818	41819	41819	she	1116	“ Our donors are arriving , ”
41823	41835	41836	41836	She	1116	“ Time to hustle some cash out of Florida ’s glitterati . ”
41841	41873	41836	41836	She	1116	“ You ’d better hustle some dollars , too , Kattenberger . Just because I lost our bet does n’t mean you get to loaf around drinking Scotch on my dime . ”
41874	41886	41887	41887	She	1116	“ I can raise more than you in the first hour . ”
41892	41899	41887	41887	She	1116	“ No , you ca n’t . ”
41973	41978	41979	41979	I	113	“ You look stunning , ”
42007	42011	42012	42012	she	1116	“ Thank you , ”
42015	42027	42012	42012	she	1116	“ You ’re looking dapper yourself . Do you need anything ? ”
42028	42069	42012	42012	she	1116	“ Just the usual . If somebody is monopolizing me , think up a reason to drag me away . I think I just challenged Alex to a duel — who can raise the most cash in the next hour . ”
42070	42095	42012	42012	she	1116	“ Of course you did . Hey — that guy over there with the silver tie ? He ’s a Florida senator , right ? ”
42103	42118	42096	42096	I	113	“ Good eye , buddy . I should talk to him about net neutrality . ”
42119	42124	42125	42125	She	1116	“ Get in there . ”
42135	42154	42125	42125	She	1116	“ I ’ll get a drink and follow you in a minute . Just do me a favor ? ”
42155	42158	42159	42159	My	113	“ Yeah ? ”
42181	42203	42163	42168	the hockey players in the corner	1124	“ Do n’t stare at Rebecca ’s cleavage the whole time you ’re chatting with the senator . He ’ll notice . ”
42204	42207	42208	42208	I	113	“ Jesus , ”
42240	42244	42245	42245	Lauren	91	“ Jesus yourself , ”
42249	42287	42288	42288	Her	91	“ Why do you think it ’s okay to stage an intervention in my life , yet I have to pretend not to notice all the things wrong in yours ? Ignoring all your bullshit gets old . ”
42297	42308	42288	42288	Her	91	“ Senator ! What can we get you to drink ? ”
42438	42452	42453	42455	my best friend	397	“ If you see the spring roll guy again , wave me down , ”
42458	42475	42453	42455	my best friend	397	“ I have to go chase that journalist away from Castro , who ’s looking tipsy . ”
42476	42480	42481	42481	I	113	“ Will do , ”
42485	42501	42481	42481	I	113	“ You want another glass of bubbly ? I think I ’ll get a drink . ”
42502	42505	42506	42506	she	397	“ Sure ! ”
42512	42518	42506	42506	she	397	“ Back in a jif ! ”
42781	42786	42787	42787	she	1145	“ Hi , Becca , ”
42794	42800	42787	42787	she	1145	“ Party going all right ? ”
42810	42820	42804	42804	I	113	“ Of course . You planned a beautiful event . ”
42895	42903	42904	42904	Alex	130	“ Let me ask you a question , ”
42907	42925	42904	42904	Alex	130	“ Why do you suppose Nate moved you to Brooklyn from his Manhattan office two years ago ? ”
42943	42949	42950	42950	I	113	“ I have no idea , ”
42960	42968	42969	42969	Gulp	217	“ Well , what I mean is … ”
42971	43001	42969	42969	Gulp	217	“ There were several reasons . Nate wanted someone he trusted to look after the new office in Brooklyn . And I ’m not as … Manhattan as Lauren . ”
43002	43013	43014	43014	Alex	130	“ Lauren is from Long Island , is n’t she ? ”
43023	43029	43014	43014	Alex	130	“ Not Manhattan at all . ”
43086	43092	43095	43095	her	841	“ What ’s your point ? ”
43106	43140	43098	43098	I	113	“ If you ’re trying to point out that Nate upgraded to a smarter , more fashionable , more ambitious assistant than I ’ll ever be , believe me , I already know . ”
43153	43156	43141	43141	Alex	130	“ Chardonnay . ”
43188	43194	43195	43195	she	841	“ My point , hon , ”
43199	43220	43195	43195	she	841	“ is only that maybe you should ask Nate . Make him tell you why he moved you to Brooklyn . ”
43221	43224	43195	43195	she	841	“ Uh … ”
43232	43235	43195	43195	she	841	“ Okay ? ”
43272	43278	43279	43280	the bartender	1074	“ May I help you ? ”
43316	43326	43279	43280	the bartender	1074	“ Could I please have two glasses of champagne ? ”
43327	43333	43294	43294	Bartenders	1152	“ Of course , miss . ”
43385	43389	43390	43390	I	113	“ Thank you , ”
43801	43808	43811	43811	Lauren	91	“ Rebecca ? Are you okay ? ”
43818	43824	43825	43825	I	113	“ I do n’t know , ”
43828	43834	43811	43811	Lauren	91	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
43844	43864	43835	43835	My	113	“ I was n’t supposed to drink . But I thought a single glass of champagne would be okay . ”
43865	43871	43872	43872	Lauren	91	“ And it is n’t ? ”
43875	43882	43835	43835	My	113	“ Not so much , no . ”
43883	43889	43835	43835	My	113	“ Do you feel sick ? ”
43916	43930	43931	43931	I	113	“ I thought I might be sick , but my stomach is fine . ”
43944	43959	43931	43931	I	113	“ My head is all woozy , though . I need to go upstairs . ”
43960	43967	43968	43968	she	91	“ I ’ll go with you , ”
43987	44000	43968	43968	she	91	“ Do n’t tell Nate . He ’ll be pissed at me . ”
44001	44007	44008	44008	Lauren	91	“ Oh , screw him , ”
44018	44025	44008	44008	Lauren	91	“ He does n’t control us . ”
44026	44045	44046	44046	I	113	“ But he ’s gone to so much trouble for me , and I ’m such an idiot . ”
44062	44078	44046	44046	I	113	“ The fancy new doctor said not to drink . And I did n’t listen . ”
44079	44085	44086	44086	Lauren	91	“ Lesson learned , then , ”
44090	44096	44086	44086	Lauren	91	“ Where are your shoes ? ”
44097	44105	44046	44046	I	113	“ I left them under a barstool . ”
44106	44110	44111	44111	Lauren	91	“ Sit here . ”
44136	44143	44129	44129	I	113	“ I ’ll find your shoes . ”
44144	44159	44160	44160	Lauren	91	“ Really ? I ’m sorry . You ’re being so nice to me . ”
44193	44200	44173	44173	You	1169	“ Just do n’t go anywhere . ”
44315	44322	44300	44300	she	91	“ I ’ve got it now , ”

44333	44342	44343	44343	she	91	“ Let me come in for a minute , ”
44346	44367	44343	44343	she	91	“ That way if our overlord interrogates me later , I can tell him for sure that you ’re fine . ”
44368	44374	44375	44375	I	113	“ Nate is so bossy , ”
44381	44387	44388	44388	Lauren	91	“ As are all men , ”
44416	44440	44404	44404	I	113	“ I ’m sorry you ’re not getting a hookup with a basketball player . If that was your plan for the evening . ”
44459	44484	44447	44447	I	113	“ This is n’t for special occasions . I always wear lingerie . It ’s my way of reminding myself that sex still exists . ”
44485	44505	44441	44441	I	113	“ Huh . I should try that . And Nate would pee himself if he saw you in this . ”
44506	44509	44510	44510	I	113	“ Why ? ”
44532	44545	44525	44525	Lauren	91	“ Do you need any aspirin ? Or a glass of water ? ”
44546	44570	44578	44578	I	113	“ I guess water is a good idea . I just feel so odd . Like I had ten drinks instead of one . ”
44601	44613	44590	44590	Lauren	91	“ Look , do you think we should call your doctor ? ”
44614	44639	44590	44590	Lauren	91	“ No ! One glass of champagne ca n’t kill me . I do n’t want to make a big deal out of it . ”
44640	44645	44646	44646	she	91	“ Are you sure ? ”
44649	44656	44646	44646	she	91	“ Nate wo n’t be mad . ”
44657	44663	44664	44664	I	113	“ Yes , he will ! ”
44673	44688	44664	44664	I	113	“ I ’m just gon na sleep it off . Do n’t tell anyone . ”
44689	44692	44693	44693	Lauren	91	“ Okay , ”
44696	44721	44693	44693	Lauren	91	“ Under one condition . You let me take your key card and come back to check on you in a couple of hours . ”

44998	45004	45005	45005	I	113	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
45010	45013	45014	45014	he	500	“ Nothing , ”
45017	45023	45014	45014	he	500	“ Just checking on you . ”
45030	45036	45024	45024	I	113	“ Lauren tattled on me ? ”
45037	45040	45041	45041	He	500	“ No . ”
45049	45085	45041	45041	He	500	“ I saw you leave the party looking shaky . I was asking around for you and Lauren only told me where you were on one condition — that I do n’t yell at you . ”
45086	45089	45090	45090	I	113	“ Oh . ”
45199	45210	45211	45211	I	113	“ You just woke me up from the best dream , ”
45222	45225	45226	45226	Nate	1114	“ Urghl ? ”

45244	45293	45237	45237	I	113	“ All the cashmere sweaters were on super sale . And there were good colors on the rack . Not just the yellow ones , you know ? And I think I saw a sign about a shoe discount . I was going to check that out next . ”
45304	45322	45301	45301	he	1114	“ Sorry to ruin your shopping dream . Just wanted to make sure you were still breathing . ”
45323	45331	45294	45294	Nate	1114	“ I feel much better , honestly . ”
45364	45374	45375	45375	I	113	“ I ’m totally awake now , you jerk , ”
45385	45391	45378	45378	he	1114	“ What time is it ? ”

45462	45491	45492	45492	He	1114	“ I swear I am . The dizziness is gone now . It was just one glass of champagne , and I did n’t believe that it could … ”
45498	45513	45492	45492	He	1114	“ You do n’t have to explain it to me . Not my business . ”
45514	45517	45523	45523	Lauren	91	“ Really ? ”
45529	45553	45523	45523	Lauren	91	“ Here I ’m handing you a golden opportunity to say ‘ I told you so . ’ Leap on it , man . ”
45566	45578	45554	45554	Nate	1114	“ Ca n’t do it . I promised I would n’t . ”
45579	45584	45554	45554	Nate	1114	“ You promised Lauren ? ”
45603	45641	45585	45585	He	1114	“ I do n’t want to nag you , Bec . You ’re obviously fine . And you take good care of everyone , including yourself . Lauren just made me admit it . That ’s all . ”
45661	45668	45645	45645	Lauren	91	“ She sure looked glamorous tonight . ”
45669	45674	45675	45675	Nate	1114	“ So did you . ”
45748	45755	45738	45746	the only two people awake in all of Florida	1189	“ Can I ask you something ? ”
45756	45759	45760	45760	he	1114	“ Sure , ”
45771	45785	45738	45746	the only two people awake in all of Florida	1189	“ Why did you switch my job for Lauren ’s two years ago ? ”
45810	45818	45819	45819	I	113	“ You can tell me the truth , ”
45822	45850	45819	45819	I	113	“ If you think Lauren is sharper than I am . Or more skilled at handling the bigwigs who call you . I wo n’t be offended . ”
45856	45870	45819	45819	I	113	“ But it ’s always bothered me that I did n’t know why . ”
45871	45875	45876	45876	He	1114	“ It has ? ”
45881	45884	45885	45885	I	113	“ Yeah , ”
45888	45904	45885	45885	I	113	“ I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I did wrong . ”
45905	45908	45909	45909	he	1114	“ Fuck , ”
45912	45923	45909	45909	he	1114	“ I ’m sorry . That was never my intention . ”
45940	45945	45924	45924	I	113	“ It was n’t ? ”
45946	45963	45924	45924	I	113	“ Jesus , no . You did n’t do anything wrong . Not a single thing . ”
45964	45968	45969	45969	My	113	“ Then why ? ”
46001	46009	45969	45969	My	113	“ Because I ’m a goddamn idiot . ”
46051	46059	46044	46044	he	1114	“ Are n’t you going to explain ? ”
46060	46068	46069	46069	he	1114	“ Not if I can help it , ”
46072	46075	46076	46076	I	113	“ Nate ! ”
46092	46099	46076	46076	I	113	“ Just tell me , okay ! ”
46100	46110	46111	46111	he	1114	“ What if you do n’t like the answer ? ”
46115	46134	46076	46076	I	113	“ But maybe you owe it to me anyway . I think you ’re being illogical right now ! ”
46135	46139	46140	46140	he	1114	“ No kidding ! ”
46154	46175	46149	46149	We	1192	“ I ca n’t be logical when it comes to you ! Ca n’t do it . Not for years . ”

46288	46291	46279	46279	I	113	“ Please . ”
46338	46374	46334	46334	he	1114	“ It was two years ago in March , and you had just started dating that … guy . The artist . He liked to come by the office to talk before you left together . ”
46394	46413	46382	46382	I	113	“ Wait … That kid who was a courier , and also painted ? Why would he matter ? ”
46480	46507	46459	46459	he	1114	“ I could n’t stand it , Bec . I wanted you to have someone and be happy . But I did n’t want to watch . ”
46787	46790	46791	46791	I	113	“ Why ? ”
47035	47038	47039	47039	I	113	“ Nate ! ”

47055	47060	47052	47052	Nate	1114	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
47061	47066	47067	47067	I	113	“ You should be ! ”
47070	47094	47067	47067	I	113	“ You just broke the seal ! We spent seven years not doing that ! And now I know what it ’s like . ”
47119	47123	47111	47111	he	1114	“ I mean … ”
47156	47201	47138	47138	His	1114	“ Bec , listen — I will apologize again and get the fuck out of your room . But for the love of god , help me understand — are you pissed off about the kiss ? Or are you pissed that I stopped ? ”
47202	47210	47138	47138	His	1114	“ That ’s not an easy question ! ”
47220	47227	47213	47213	His	1114	“ But it ’s multiple choice ! ”
47347	47350	47351	47351	His	1114	“ Ungh . ”

49929	49939	49926	49926	I	113	“ They ’re right there on the bathroom counter . ”

49944	49951	49952	49952	I	113	“ I ’d never endanger you , ”

52965	52973	52961	52961	I	113	“ I ’m going for a walk . ”
52995	53012	53013	53014	My sister	360	“ Before you go … there ’s two pieces of mail you need to look at . ”
53051	53079	53040	53040	she	360	“ This says it ’s from a real estate company , so I thought it might be important . And the other is a health insurance thing . ”
53095	53102	53040	53040	she	360	“ This is our new lease . ”
53202	53205	53206	53206	I	113	“ Wow , ”
53209	53221	53206	53206	I	113	“ This is the best news I ’ve heard in weeks . ”
53222	53225	53226	53226	Missy	91	“ Yeah ? ”
53232	53240	53226	53226	Missy	91	“ No increase ? In New York ? ”
53241	53252	53206	53206	I	113	“ I know . Maybe it ’s a clerical error . ”
53253	53259	53260	53261	my sister	360	“ It does n’t matter , ”
53265	53280	53260	53261	my sister	360	“ Sign it . Send it back . They ’ll have to honor it . ”
53315	53322	53323	53323	Missy	91	“ I ’ll get a stamp , ”
53396	53403	53376	53376	I	113	“ This is not a bill , ”
53499	53504	53505	53505	Missy	91	“ Is it bad ? ”
53519	53522	53523	53523	I	113	“ No , ”
53526	53544	53523	53523	I	113	“ Just a bureaucratic snafu . Talking to the insurance company will probably eat half a day . ”
53571	53576	53577	53577	Missy	91	“ Mail the lease ! ”
53588	53598	53577	53577	Missy	91	“ That ’s one less thing to worry about . ”
53905	53908	53909	53909	Stew	143	“ Nice ! ”
53922	53939	53909	53909	Stew	143	“ That ’s how it ’s done ! I think your boys can make this happen . ”
54094	54102	54103	54103	I	113	“ We ’ll speak soon , okay ? ”
54119	54134	54113	54113	She	91	“ I ’m going to be mostly offline this week . Doctor ’s orders . ”
54367	54372	54373	54373	Lauren	91	“ Oh my God , ”
54376	54387	54373	54373	Lauren	91	“ This game is taking a year off my life . ”
54549	54552	54553	54553	Stew	143	“ Nate . ”
54563	54573	54553	54553	Stew	143	“ Are you seriously not paying attention right now ? ”
54574	54578	54579	54579	I	113	“ I am , ”
54582	54595	54596	54596	he	143	“ Only you could think about work at a time like this , ”
54746	54750	54751	54751	Lauren	91	“ Power play ! ”
54762	54770	54771	54771	she	91	“ Nice to see you paying attention , ”
54774	54785	54786	54786	I	113	“ Nice to see you ’re a hockey fan again , ”
54835	54840	54841	54841	she	91	“ This is torture , ”
55220	55223	55228	55228	he	1321	“ What ? ”
55224	55227	55228	55228	he	1321	“ Nothing , ”
55234	55246	55228	55228	he	1321	“ Want a beer ? I ’m going to the bar . ”
55247	55252	55253	55253	I	113	“ I ’m good , ”
55256	55266	55267	55267	Lauren	91	“ I ’ll get you a drink , Stew , ”
55275	55284	55287	55287	Lauren	91	“ No ! You do n’t have to . ”
55322	55337	55338	55338	She	91	“ But I want a drink and I do n’t know what they have . ”
55346	55365	55338	55338	She	91	“ I ’ll go . And maybe you can snap Nate out of being such a space cadet . ”
55366	55369	55370	55370	Stew	143	“ Dude , ”
55376	55397	55370	55370	Stew	143	“ What is up with you ? And do n’t tell me you are thinking about systems architecture right now . ”
55398	55409	55338	55338	She	91	“ I ’m a little distracted . No big deal . ”
55415	55434	55410	55410	Stew	143	“ Please tell me you ’ve finally broken your dry spell . I was starting to get worried . ”
55435	55441	55370	55370	Stew	143	“ Oh , fuck off . ”
55445	55453	55442	55442	He	1321	“ So who ’s the lucky girl ? ”
55454	55464	55410	55410	Stew	143	“ I ca n’t talk about this with you . ”
55472	55476	55410	55410	Stew	143	“ Why not ? ”
55477	55489	55442	55442	He	1321	“ Because you know her . I ’m not a gossip . ”
55490	55512	55410	55410	Stew	143	“ You are totally a gossip . But also weirdly discreet . Now this will drive me insane , you realize . ”
55513	55518	55442	55442	He	1321	“ Not my problem . ”
55519	55533	55410	55410	Stew	143	“ Fucker . I ’m almost tempted to think you finally bagged Rebecca . ”
55553	55558	55559	55559	he	1321	“ No fucking way , ”
55582	55590	55607	55607	Stew	143	“ Seriously ? When did this happen ? ”
55591	55606	55607	55607	Stew	143	“ Remember ten seconds ago when I told you we were n’t discussing it ? ”
55612	55619	55607	55607	Stew	143	“ Is this an ongoing thing ? ”
55624	55646	55620	55620	I	113	“ I ’d feel a whole lot better right now if you tell me you ’ve been secretly dating all year . ”
55647	55655	55656	55656	I	113	“ Not as much as I would , ”
55662	55681	55659	55659	Stew	143	“ So … this happened once , and now she ’s freezing you out ? Was it recently ? ”
55682	55715	55607	55607	Stew	143	“ Bal Harbour . Just a few days ago . Then she went back to New York , and I ’m here . I do n’t know what ’s in her head . ”
55716	55729	55659	55659	Stew	143	“ Did you call her ? Please tell me you called her . ”
55730	55747	55607	55607	Stew	143	“ Of course I did . No pickup , though . I sent a few texts . ”
55753	55760	55748	55748	Stew	143	“ Then you have a problem . ”
55761	55767	55659	55659	Stew	143	“ Gosh , you think ? ”
55768	55792	55748	55748	Stew	143	“ No , a big problem . She ’s your employee , and now you ’re pursuing her . You have to stop . ”
55793	55804	55659	55659	Stew	143	“ Obviously she and I need to have a conversation . ”
55825	55834	55820	55820	he	143	“ No . I think you fucked up . ”
55835	55842	55843	55843	I	113	“ And you know this how ? ”
55860	55882	55925	55925	she	91	“ You two got it on , and now she ’s not returning your calls ? That ’s some bad juju . ”
55883	55892	55893	55893	I	113	“ Maybe she just needs time to process . ”
55898	55913	55925	55925	she	91	“ How did this go down anyway ? Please tell me she started it . ”
55940	55946	55925	55925	she	91	“ She definitely escalated it . ”
55947	55952	55925	55925	she	91	“ You kissed her . ”
55953	55957	55958	55958	I	113	“ I did , ”
56013	56020	56021	56021	Stew	143	“ You planted one on her , ”
56024	56029	56021	56021	Stew	143	“ Then what happened ? ”
56030	56063	56088	56088	I	113	“ She made a noise , so I stopped . Then she yelled at me for a minute , climbed in my lap , and kissed me like the world was ending . ”
56074	56087	56066	56066	Stew	143	“ Wow . You ’ve been waiting years for that to happen . ”
56095	56106	56088	56088	I	113	“ So you guys got freaky . And then what ? ”
56107	56116	56088	56088	I	113	“ You do n’t get any more details . ”
56117	56126	56088	56088	I	113	“ I meant in the morning , dumbass . ”
56129	56176	56088	56088	I	113	“ I spent the night . Then I asked her to have breakfast with me , but she said she had plans . I put her in the limo an hour later , kissed her goodbye , said I could n’t wait to see her again . ”
56177	56187	56088	56088	I	113	“ And now she ’s not taking your call . ”
56188	56192	56088	56088	I	113	“ Pretty much . ”
56193	56197	56198	56198	Stew	143	“ Jesus Christ . ”
56205	56213	56198	56198	Stew	143	“ She was n’t drunk , right ? ”
56214	56239	56088	56088	I	113	“ No ! Not at all . She was chatty , asking me questions . She asked me why I transferred her to Brooklyn . ”
56240	56255	56198	56198	Stew	143	“ And you said , ‘ Because I ’m in love with you ’ ? ”
56256	56266	56088	56088	I	113	“ No . That would have been an exaggeration . ”
56297	56313	56198	56198	Stew	143	“ My initial analysis suggests only two reasons why she is n’t returning your call . ”
56324	56341	56198	56198	Stew	143	“ Number one , she did n’t like it and does n’t want to tell you . ”
56342	56347	56348	56348	I	113	“ She liked it , ”
56383	56388	56389	56389	He	2444	“ Well , congratulations . ”
56400	56426	56389	56389	He	2444	“ But the other option is n’t any better . Which is that she liked it at the time , but now she regrets it . ”
56440	56446	56427	56427	He	2444	“ What ’s to regret ? ”
56447	56464	56427	56427	He	2444	“ Complicating her life , for starters . You ’re the boss . It ’s tricky . ”
56465	56472	56427	56427	He	2444	“ I ’m not her boss . ”
56473	56482	56483	56483	He	2444	“ Nate , you ’re smarter than that . ”
56490	56521	56483	56483	He	2444	“ You hired her . You gave her the exact job she has now . Even if she technically works for Hugh , you ’re still her boss ’s boss . ”
56591	56597	56598	56598	Stew	143	“ I see that face , ”
56601	56640	56598	56598	Stew	143	“ You hate it when I tell you the truth . But listen , man . This is really important . You ca n’t pursue Rebecca now . Or ever . That ’s the definition of sexual harassment . ”
56641	56650	56651	56651	I	113	“ I ’m never going to harass her , ”
56680	56683	56684	56684	His	1336	“ Look . ”
56690	56733	56684	56684	His	1336	“ You ’re the least sleazy guy in the Fortune 500 . I know that . Rebecca knows that . But it does n’t matter . You do n’t get to behave any differently from the 2000 people who work for you . ”
56734	56771	56803	56803	Lauren	91	“ Actually it ’s 1999 , because I just fired you . Such a shame really , since you ’re the number two man in the company . The board is gon na pitch a fit . ”
56779	56802	56772	56772	Stew	143	“ I ’m sorry , Nate . If she did n’t work for a company you own , it would be different . ”
56842	56845	56846	56846	Stew	143	“ Yum , ”
56849	56852	56846	56846	Stew	143	“ Thanks ! ”
56853	56863	56864	56864	I	113	“ You did n’t have to bring me anything , ”
56884	56911	56875	56875	She	91	“ Do n’t worry . You paid for it . I ’m just trying to make you look a little less gloomy . Is it working ? ”
56912	56915	56916	56916	I	113	“ Sure , ”
57331	57341	57342	57342	he	107	“ That might be a land - speed record , ”
57354	57365	57342	57342	he	107	“ Thanks , man . Sorry for the shitty hour . ”
57369	57378	57366	57366	He	107	“ I ’ll live . Night , boss . ”
57470	57476	57477	57477	Bingley	143	“ Welcome home , Nate , ”
57480	57490	57477	57477	Bingley	143	“ You ’re the only one on the premises . ”
57517	57523	57524	57524	I	113	“ Engage all security systems , ”
57528	57532	57524	57524	I	113	“ Systems engaged . ”
57744	57747	57748	57748	Mom	121	“ Nate ? ”
57757	57766	57748	57748	Mom	121	“ Last night ’s game was very exciting . ”
57767	57773	57774	57775	My parents	2499	“ I know , right ? ”
57794	57805	57780	57780	they	2499	“ You ’re still coming to games three and four ? ”
57806	57820	57748	57748	Mom	121	“ We would love to . Are you sure it ’s no trouble ? ”
57821	57834	57780	57780	they	2499	“ No trouble to me . I ’m not piloting the Gulfstream . ”
57852	57879	57780	57780	they	2499	“ That is a relief , honey . Your father still gets a tense look on his face when he thinks about our old garage door . ”
57944	57951	57952	57952	he	2393	“ It was my last Olds , ”
57967	57976	57977	57977	I	113	“ normal , well - adjusted Midwestern upbringing . ”
57983	57992	57993	57993	I	113	“ Are you going to stay the week ? ”
58000	58019	57977	57977	I	113	“ We ca n’t , sweetheart . Your father ’s staff meeting on Thursday is non - negotiable . ”
58020	58023	58024	58025	My father	2393	“ Ah . ”
58043	58070	58036	58036	he	2393	“ You can fly home after the game if he does n’t want to take a personal day . I ’ll set it up that way . ”
58071	58100	58036	58036	he	2393	“ Thank you . I ’ll be a little sleepy on Wednesday , but it ’ll be worth it to watch your guys mow down Tampa at home . ”
58522	58529	58530	58530	I	113	“ I ’d better get going , ”
58545	58552	58530	58530	I	113	“ Tell Rebecca I stopped by . ”
58553	58559	58560	58560	she	91	“ I ’ll do that , ”
58567	58575	58560	58560	she	91	“ Thanks for breaking her dry spell . ”
58908	58911	58912	58912	I	113	“ Hi , ”
58930	58941	58942	58942	she	91	“ What are you doing here on a Monday night ? ”
58947	58970	58971	58971	She	91	“ I was going to ask you the same thing , since you are n’t cleared to come back to work yet . ”
58978	59000	58971	58971	She	91	“ I ca n’t do screen work , but I can stress - clean . I ’m not breaking any rules . ”
59001	59021	58971	58971	She	91	“ Stress - clean ? Just a wild guess here . But am I the cause of your stress ? ”
59063	59080	59057	59057	I	113	“ I did n’t mean to question your judgment . Can we talk for a second ? ”
59081	59087	59088	59088	she	91	“ Do we have to ? ”
59092	59095	59096	59096	I	113	“ Yeah , ”
59185	59195	59196	59196	I	113	“ You ’re not answering my calls , Bec , ”
59200	59205	59196	59196	I	113	“ Talk to me . ”
59251	59258	59259	59259	she	91	“ How did you find me ? ”
59267	59276	59277	59277	I	113	“ Since you ’re not taking my calls … ”
59287	59295	59277	59277	I	113	“ First I went to your apartment . ”
59296	59303	59259	59259	she	91	“ My sister ratted me out ? ”
59304	59313	59277	59277	I	113	“ Nope . But she was awfully chatty . ”
59317	59352	59314	59314	Rebecca	1114	“ Yeah . No boundaries on Missy . But that ’s not what ’s bothering you . Can you tell me what ’s the matter ? I can take it . Whatever it is . ”
59361	59368	59369	59369	She	91	“ I just ca n’t believe … ”
59386	59392	59380	59380	Her	91	“ I became that woman . ”
59393	59397	59408	59408	Ouch	137	“ What woman ? ”
59398	59407	59380	59380	Her	91	“ The one who sleeps with her boss . ”
59415	59424	59410	59410	I	113	“ Really ? You slept with Hugh Major ? ”
59425	59433	59434	59434	Her	91	“ Nate ! That ’s not funny ! ”
59439	59478	59434	59434	Her	91	“ Do n’t you dare pretend to be dense about this . Hugh is my boss , but only on paper . You hired me seven years ago . And you gave me this job with the team . ”
59479	59490	59410	59410	I	113	“ Sure I did . Because you ’re a professional . ”
59495	59503	59491	59491	Her	91	“ I was n’t on Tuesday night . ”
59504	59528	59531	59531	I	113	“ God , do n’t feel guilty . Because you should n’t . Not at all . Tuesday night was all my fault . ”
59562	59579	59558	59558	She	91	“ I wo n’t let you take all the blame . I was there , too . ”
59610	59618	59619	59619	she	91	“ … But it was a mistake , ”
59622	59656	59619	59619	she	91	“ It ’s not something I can be casual about . Even if I do n’t report to you directly on paper , we both know that you ’re the one in charge . ”
59664	59686	59657	59657	I	113	“ I ’d like to be in charge again , Bec . And I ’m not referring to the hockey team . ”
59687	59692	59693	59693	She	91	“ God , Nate . ”
59699	59708	59693	59693	She	91	“ Yeah , like that . But louder . ”
59722	59737	59709	59709	She	91	“ And here I thought we could just sort of agree to forget it . ”
59738	59746	59747	59747	Knife	241	“ Because that ’s what you want ? ”
59761	59807	59752	59752	Becca	1114	“ I need to forget it . We both know that you ’re one of the most hands - on owners in professional hockey . We work together all the time . I ca n’t be the girl who just casually sleeps with the boss . ”
59836	59839	59840	59840	I	113	“ Look , ”
59843	59876	59840	59840	I	113	“ I got ta call a foul on the idea that our spontaneous naked adventures were somehow job related . You did n’t climb into my lap because you wanted a raise . ”
59889	59916	59885	59885	she	91	“ Be that as it may , I want my job to stay the same . I ca n’t be known as the owner ’s plaything . ”
59925	59937	59917	59917	My	113	“ Do you really think that ’s how I see you ? ”
59938	59948	59949	59949	She	91	“ No . Yes ? I do n’t know . ”
59959	60001	59949	59949	She	91	“ I just want to rewind my life a few weeks when everything was going fine . You told me that I was supposed to focus on my recovery . And now you ’re making it really hard to do that . ”
60065	60068	60069	60069	I	113	“ Okay , ”
60085	60089	60082	60082	Rebecca	1114	“ Okay … ? ”
60090	60106	60082	60082	Rebecca	1114	“ We ’ll forget it ever happened . We ’ll never speak of it again . ”
60107	60111	60112	60112	She	91	“ All right . ”
60122	60132	60133	60133	She	91	“ Is n’t that what you asked me for ? ”
60137	60140	60141	60141	she	91	“ Yes , ”
60153	60176	60147	60147	She	91	“ I love this job . And I love our friendship . And I do n’t want to sacrifice any of it . ”
60177	60182	60183	60183	I	113	“ You wo n’t , ”
60187	60201	60183	60183	I	113	“ Nobody is taking your job , Bec . Never gon na happen . ”
60202	60207	60208	60208	She	91	“ Good to know . ”
60213	60229	60208	60208	She	91	“ Except now I wonder whether those performance evaluations you wrote me were ever unbiased . ”
60306	60326	60301	60301	I	113	“ Look . I do n’t ever want to make you uncomfortable . Tell me how to fix it . ”
60363	60393	60357	60358	This girl	91	“ We ’ll move on . I ’ll be back at work in a couple of weeks and things can just go back to the way they were before . ”
60394	60397	60398	60398	I	113	“ Right , ”
60451	60455	60456	60456	she	91	“ Thank you , ”
60593	60596	60597	60597	I	113	“ Bec , ”
60604	60607	60610	60610	she	91	“ Yeah ? ”
60656	60666	60650	60650	I	113	“ My door will always be open to you . ”
60667	60671	60672	60672	she	91	“ Thank you , ”
60676	60701	60650	60650	I	113	“ Anything you need . Ask Bingley if you do n’t want to call me . Be well , and take care of yourself . ”
60702	60706	60707	60707	she	91	“ You too , ”
60750	60773	60744	60744	Rebecca	1114	“ That ’s it , girl ! Now ease up on the death grip before I lose all feeling in this arm . ”
60834	60838	60839	60839	he	113	“ Ten more , ”
60847	60858	60843	60843	he	113	“ Ten , nine . Breathe , Becca . Eight … ”
60863	60865	60860	60860	he	113	“ one ”
60873	60878	60866	60866	I	113	“ Wow . Okay . ”
60930	60934	60935	60935	Ramón	195	“ Nicely done , ”
60938	60944	60935	60935	Ramón	195	“ How ’d that feel ? ”
60945	60961	60962	60962	I	113	“ I ’m not puking on your Nikes . So there ’s your first clue . ”
60979	60982	60985	60985	himself	135	“ Rebecca ! ”
60998	61004	60985	60985	himself	135	“ How are we doing ? ”
61005	61012	61013	61013	Ramón	195	“ The trampoline is now possible , ”
61016	61042	61013	61013	Ramón	195	“ Her recovery time still has some room to improve , but , heck . Give her a week . She ’s shaping up fast . ”
61096	61103	61091	61091	I	113	“ You guys are miracle workers . ”
61104	61113	61114	61115	the doctor	629	“ You ’re doing all your own healing , ”
61118	61129	61114	61115	the doctor	629	“ We just showed you where to look for it . ”
61130	61135	61136	61136	I	113	“ What ’s next ? ”
61145	61164	61140	61140	He	195	“ The dreaded spinning chair . And then we ’ll have time for one Ping - Pong game . ”
61165	61173	61222	61223	Dr. Armitage	135	“ You have to let me win . ”
61174	61177	61178	61179	the trainer	983	“ Pffft ! ”
61187	61210	61178	61179	the trainer	983	“ That ’s not included in the price . Come on now . Let ’s get it over with in the chair . ”
61211	61221	61222	61223	Dr. Armitage	135	“ Stop by my office when you ’re done , ”
61226	61229	61222	61223	Dr. Armitage	135	“ Absolutely . ”
61274	61285	61260	61261	Dr. Armitage	135	“ You ’re making great progress . This is terrific . ”
61286	61292	61293	61293	I	113	“ It ’s really encouraging , ”
61296	61314	61293	61293	I	113	“ I feel better . I think I could go back to work , do n’t you ? ”
61324	61390	61321	61321	He	135	“ Soon . This early progress is terrific , but vestibular therapy never goes in a straight line . Most patients experience plateaus before they can make further progress . And we ’re asking a lot of your body right now . You need to give the physical work a little more time before you ’re ready to tax your eyesight in an office environment . ”
61393	61396	61397	61397	I	113	“ Okay … ”
61402	61444	61397	61397	I	113	“ How much time , though ? I need to work . I ’ve used up every sick day I ever had , and then some . It would be great if I could tell my boss when to expect me . ”
61545	61554	61555	61556	the doctor	629	“ Let ’s talk again in a week , ”
61560	61593	61555	61556	the doctor	629	“ Get a lot of sleep , and stay active . Then maybe we can discuss a part - time return to work . Would your employer consider an arrangement like that ? ”
61594	61597	61555	61556	the doctor	629	“ Sure . ”
61617	61646	61605	61605	I	113	“ Honestly , it would be good for me to go back part - time . It ’s really stressful not to show my face in the office . ”
61651	61697	61647	61647	His	1114	“ I ’m sure I ’d feel the same way . Give it at least one more week at home , okay ? I ’m happy to write a letter to whomever you need , if your continued absence requires a letter in your file . ”
61728	61741	61698	61699	Hugh Major	2070	“ Thanks , I ’ll let you know if that ’s necessary . ”
62774	62781	62782	62782	I	113	“ What are people saying now ? ”
62789	62792	62782	62782	I	113	“ Nothing . ”
62793	62803	62782	62782	I	113	“ It ’s Twitter . There must be something . ”
62804	62819	62782	62782	I	113	“ Someone tweeted that the line for the women ’s bathroom is too long . ”
62820	62823	62824	62824	Matthew	88	“ Waaaaaaah ! ”
62838	62844	62845	62845	I	113	“ Give me the phone , ”
62886	62889	62890	62890	she	91	“ Hello ! ”
62893	62896	62890	62890	she	91	“ Becca ? ”
62897	62903	62904	62904	I	113	“ What ’s the score ? ”
62907	62913	62914	62914	she	91	“ I ’m so tense ! ”
62932	62954	62890	62890	she	91	“ Gigi — which radio station is covering the game ? I need to hear the play - by - play . ”
62955	62966	62914	62914	she	91	“ Hockey on the radio ? Is that a thing ? ”
62967	62988	62890	62890	she	91	“ Is n’t it ? Old men listen to baseball . You ’re the publicist ! Do n’t you know ? ”
62989	63005	62914	62914	she	91	“ Rebecca , are you okay ? Why are n’t you here watching , anyway ? ”
63041	63061	63032	63032	She	91	“ I ’m all right . It ’s complicated . Just tell me what ’s happening on the ice . ”
63062	63076	62890	62890	she	91	“ The first line is on shift . Leo , Bayer , Castro . ”
63077	63089	63032	63032	She	91	“ Wow ! Young lineup tonight . Who ’s on D ? ”
63090	63118	62890	62890	she	91	“ Douley and … O’Doul passes to Leo ! And it’s … OMIGOD . OH ! COME ON ! Yes ! Not quite . Fuck ! Arrrgh ! ”
63119	63138	63032	63032	She	91	“ What happened ? We did n’t score ? Please tell me the other guy did n’t score . ”
63151	63154	63155	63155	I	113	“ Georgia ? ”
63187	63201	63171	63171	I	113	“ Hello , my dear Rebecca . How may I be of assistance ? ”
63202	63205	63206	63206	I	113	“ Hi ! ”
63225	63238	63206	63206	I	113	“ I need to know what ’s happening with the hockey game . ”
63239	63248	63171	63171	I	113	“ The hockey game is currently in session . ”
63249	63260	63206	63206	I	113	“ The score , Bingley . What ’s the score ? ”
63261	63269	63171	63171	I	113	“ Tie game at 0 - 0 . ”
63270	63281	63206	63206	I	113	“ Okay . What else ? Who has the puck ? ”
63282	63293	63171	63171	I	113	“ The puck is a six ounce black rubber disc . ”
63294	63311	63206	63206	I	113	“ I know that , Bingley . But which player is controlling the puck right now ? ”
63312	63318	63319	63319	Bingley	143	“ One moment , miss , ”
63323	63329	63319	63319	Bingley	143	“ I ’m seeking assistance . ”
63373	63404	63365	63365	Bingley	143	“ Nate reminds you that you need your rest to heal . But he adds that you should come to the stadium if you want to see who ’s playing . ”
63405	63414	63351	63351	KTech	186	“ Wait , what ? You asked Nate ? ”
63415	63456	63365	63365	Bingley	143	“ Naturally . He ’s my admin . Standby for another communication . Ah . Nate has asked me to send you a car . ETA three minutes . Black Mercedes C class . The driver ’s name is Parker . ”
63466	63476	63457	63457	I	113	“ Dear Rebecca , are you quite all right ? ”
63477	63482	63483	63483	I	113	“ I ’m fine , ”
63522	63526	63527	63527	Bingley	143	“ Oh dear , ”
63530	63543	63527	63527	Bingley	143	“ The score is now 1 - 0 in favor of Tampa . ”
63544	63548	63527	63527	Bingley	143	“ Oh no ! ”
63549	63562	63527	63527	Bingley	143	“ Oh yes . Also , your car is two minutes away . ”
63669	63676	63677	63677	I	113	“ I ’ll jump out here ! ”
63683	63691	63677	63677	I	113	“ It ’s just ahead , miss . ”
63692	63700	63701	63701	I	113	“ I know ! Got ta run , ”
63709	63712	63701	63701	I	113	“ Toodles ! ”
63895	63901	63889	63889	I	113	“ What ’s the score ? ”
63913	63945	63889	63889	I	113	“ One - one . We scored to tie it up . End of the second period now . Tampa just rushed the net , but Beacon made a glove save . ”
64031	64037	64038	64038	I	113	“ Do n’t you start , ”
64048	64065	64038	64038	I	113	“ It ’s not that late and I ca n’t sleep if the game ’s on . ”
64180	64189	64173	64173	her	397	“ I thought you were n’t supposed to … ”
64190	64193	64194	64194	I	113	“ Shh ! ”
64198	64210	64194	64194	I	113	“ It ’s one sip . Do n’t alert my jailer . ”
64246	64276	64233	64233	Georgia	95	“ How ’s it going , anyway ? I have n’t heard much from you since the party in Bal Harbour . Are you still staying at Nate ’s ? ”
64277	64280	64281	64281	I	113	“ Nope . ”
64294	64301	64281	64281	I	113	“ Back in my own apartment . ”
64302	64305	64306	64306	Georgia	95	“ Okay … ”
64373	64378	64379	64379	Georgia	95	“ Baby , no ! ”
64469	64474	64475	64475	Nate	1114	“ Oh , Jesus , ”
64489	64497	64475	64475	Nate	1114	“ Do n’t you dare start a … ”
64845	64848	64849	64849	I	113	“ Whew , ”
64876	64883	64884	64884	Georgia	95	“ So what ’s your deal ? ”
64888	64894	64884	64884	Georgia	95	“ What do you mean ? ”
64895	64904	64905	64905	Georgia	95	“ Why were you late to the game ? ”
64910	64928	64905	64905	Georgia	95	“ Come with me to the ladies ’ room . I have a few questions for you . ”
64955	64968	64945	64946	Mrs. Kattenberger	167	“ Rebecca ! It ’s good to see you on your feet ! ”
64993	65007	64977	64977	I	113	“ Oh , do n’t worry about me . I ’ll be fine . ”
65062	65069	65070	65070	I	113	“ I ’ve had better months , ”
65077	65086	65070	65070	I	113	“ But I ’m doing better every day . ”
65087	65102	65122	65122	she	1485	“ You poor thing ! What have you been doing to keep yourself busy ? ”
65129	65134	65135	65135	I	113	“ This and that , ”
65205	65212	65213	65213	I	113	“ This game is so stressful ! ”
65231	65235	65236	65236	she	167	“ It is ! ”
65364	65369	65370	65370	Georgia	95	“ Uh , Bec ? ”
65442	65449	65450	65450	Georgia	95	“ Okay , spill , dammit , ”
65468	65479	65459	65461	The bathroom attendant	1498	“ Good evening , ladies ! How ’s the game ? ”
65480	65483	65484	65484	I	113	“ Stressful , ”
65487	65490	65491	65491	Georgia	95	“ Awesome ! ”
65494	65517	65459	65461	The bathroom attendant	1498	“ Maybe for you ! You ’re the one whose honey just scored . So you ’ll be scoring later , too . ”
65518	65522	65523	65523	Georgia	95	“ About that , ”
65536	65547	65548	65548	Her	1489	“ I ’m waiting for you to fill me in . ”
65557	65575	65617	65617	her	1489	“ About what ? And should n’t you be downstairs prepping for a press conference right now ? ”
65576	65600	65601	65601	She	1489	“ Do n’t you dodge me , missy . Danny is setting up the conference tonight , anyway . He ’s in training . ”
65604	65615	65601	65601	She	1489	“ So spill already . I ’ve got all night . ”
65655	65666	65651	65651	she	1489	“ Do n’t you have anything to say for yourself ? ”
65667	65671	65617	65617	her	1489	“ Such as ? ”
65672	65698	65651	65651	she	1489	“ Such as — why did you turn bright purple a minute ago during the world ’s shortest conversation with a certain person ’s mom ? ”
65699	65702	65703	65703	I	113	“ Well … ”
65710	65718	65703	65703	I	113	“ Not purple . Red , maybe . ”
65735	65746	65747	65747	Her	1489	“ Oh . My . God . You did n’t ! ”
65754	65771	65747	65747	Her	1489	“ Wow . It was Bal Harbour , right ? You canceled breakfast for sex with … ”
65783	65795	65772	65772	I	113	“ Please . A little discretion regarding my poor life choices . ”
65820	65825	65826	65826	she	1489	“ Oh my God , ”
65836	65848	65826	65826	she	1489	“ Wow . Florida has some powerful mojo . Who knew ? ”
65857	65860	65861	65861	She	1489	“ Okay . ”
65871	65882	65861	65861	She	1489	“ I just have one question . Was it good ? ”
65893	65916	65883	65883	Ugh	214	“ Does it even matter ? It does n’t make my life less complicated , so it ’s really beside the point . ”
65917	65927	65928	65928	Georgia	95	“ It is not at all beside the point ! ”
65935	65952	65928	65928	Georgia	95	“ Either you ’re into him or you ’re not . So which way is it ? ”
65953	65983	65883	65883	Ugh	214	“ It ’s not that simple . We ca n’t just have an office fling , Georgia . There would be consequences — more for me than for him . ”
65984	65987	65988	65988	She	1489	“ Well … ”
65999	66017	65988	65988	She	1489	“ That ’s the whole problem , right ? There ’s an imbalance of power between you . ”
66018	66024	65883	65883	Ugh	214	“ Yes ! Thank you ! ”
66025	66028	66029	66029	She	1489	“ N — ”
66033	66091	66029	66029	She	1489	“ Your guy has more power than anyone else I know . But it ’s also his prison . I ’ll bet he ca n’t trust that anyone he meets will ever love him for his own sake . And since his company is his life , anyone he meets there is already in debt to him . ”
66116	66144	66113	66113	he	1504	“ Let ’s not get out the violins just yet . Nobody can have everything come easily . What would be the fun of that , anyway ? ”
66148	66175	66145	66145	Georgia	95	“ I know . Did he , uh , say he ’d like to see you again sometime . Out of the office , I mean ? ”
66176	66183	66184	66184	I	113	“ Or bent over his desk , ”
66211	66216	66221	66221	herself	397	“ Oh , wow . ”
66227	66238	66239	66239	She	397	“ Remind me to always knock on doors at work . ”
66248	66271	66243	66243	I	113	“ Actually , you do n’t have to bother . Because I told him we need to just forget the whole thing . ”
66272	66275	66276	66276	Georgia	95	“ Oh . ”
66280	66309	66276	66276	Georgia	95	“ But why ? Because my mind just went straight to candlelit dinners and weekends in Bermuda . Picture the dinner parties you could throw in that mansion ! ”
66318	66365	66310	66310	I	113	“ That is a fairy tale . Reality is far more awkward . What if we dated and it did n’t work out ? I do n’t want to live with the fallout . And besides , I would n’t even know how to be his … ”
66366	66369	66370	66370	Georgia	95	“ Girlfriend , ”
66380	66407	66370	66370	Georgia	95	“ My psyche might not be able to wrap itself around the concept . I used to get his coffee , Georgia . I still do . ”
66408	66411	66412	66414	The bathroom attendant	1498	“ Girl ! ”
66417	66467	66412	66414	The bathroom attendant	1498	“ I ’ll get his coffee till the day I die if it means I get banged by a hot , rich guy in Bermuda . Whoever he is , you got ta give it a whirl . If you do n’t , I ’ll do it for you . ”
66468	66476	66477	66477	Georgia	95	“ She makes a really good point , ”
67014	67023	67008	67008	Bingley	143	“ Master Nate ! Is everything all right ? ”
67024	67028	66997	66997	I	113	“ I guess . ”
67029	67053	67008	67008	Bingley	143	“ Could you repeat that , good sir ? I wo n’t alert the security team if there is no cause for concern . ”
67054	67061	66997	66997	I	113	“ I ’m fine , Bingley . ”
67062	67078	67008	67008	Bingley	143	“ Glad to hear it , sir . Can I help you with anything further ? ”
67127	67130	67131	67131	I	113	“ Bingley , ”
67134	67142	67131	67131	I	113	“ How do you get over someone ? ”
67143	67149	67150	67150	he	143	“ Get over a person ? ”
67153	67171	67150	67150	he	143	“ As in , pass over them in physical space or remove oneself from a romantic entanglement . ”
67172	67186	67131	67131	I	113	“ The latter , Bingley . I ca n’t even picture the former . ”
67187	67201	67150	67150	he	143	“ Just a moment , sir . I ’ll perform an internet search . ”
67207	67232	67233	67233	he	143	“ Nate , we are all fools in love . There are six hundred and twenty - two million search results for this question , ”
67236	67301	67233	67233	he	143	“ The most common suggestions are as follows . Number one , do n’t bottle up your emotions . Cry as necessary . Two , acknowledge your anger , if you are angry . Three , take care of yourself in other ways . Do n’t forget to eat well and exercise . Four , listen to music , especially uptempo songs . Five … ”
67302	67308	67309	67309	I	113	“ Thank you , Bingley , ”
67312	67318	67319	67319	he	143	“ … Keep a journal , ”
67322	67326	67319	67319	he	143	“ A journal . ”
67327	67347	67233	67233	he	143	“ Yes . A record of your thoughts and feelings , validating and exercising those emotions on the page . ”
67449	67466	67442	67443	favorite team	1536	“ Bingley . Are there any new injury reports for the Dallas team or for Anaheim ? ”
67467	67486	67442	67443	favorite team	1536	“ One moment , sir … Yes . Simms will not be appearing in game one for Anaheim . ”
67487	67490	67442	67443	favorite team	1536	“ Fuck . ”
67491	67494	67442	67443	favorite team	1536	“ Sir ? ”
67495	67507	67442	67443	favorite team	1536	“ It ’s an expression of displeasure . Ignore all fucks . ”
67508	67513	67442	67443	favorite team	1536	“ Yes , sir . ”
67593	67600	67601	67601	Bingley	143	“ Stewart is calling , sir , ”
67628	67631	67632	67632	I	113	“ Yeah , ”
67638	67645	67632	67632	I	113	“ What ’s up , man ? ”
67646	67656	67657	67657	he	143	“ I ’m on a golf course on Kiawah , ”
67663	67670	67657	67657	he	143	“ What ’s up with you ? ”
67671	67696	67700	67700	we	1539	“ Are you calling to see if I ’m out giving the HR department something to fret over ? Well , I ’m not . ”
67706	67726	67700	67700	we	1539	“ I ’m just lying here on the sofa , conversing with my digital assistant . As one does . ”
67735	67773	67727	67729	My old friend	143	“ Look , I ’m not checking up on you . And before the players behind us get pissed off , I just had a text that we ’re getting an offer for the router division tomorrow . ”
67774	67777	67778	67778	I	113	“ Really ? ”
67782	67786	67778	67778	I	113	“ From who ? ”
67800	67821	67727	67729	My old friend	143	“ Actually , from iBits Canada . The chipmaker . And they want to do a licensing deal , too . ”
67822	67829	67794	67794	she	130	“ Well , that ’s complicated . ”
67830	67860	67727	67729	My old friend	143	“ A little bit . Anyway — we’ll get all the deets tomorrow , okay ? Just thought you ’d want to know so you can plan your week . ”
67861	67873	67794	67794	she	130	“ Thanks , man . Hit ‘ em long and straight . ”
67874	67892	67727	67729	My old friend	143	“ As if . I ’ve already lost a lifetime ’s worth of balls on this course . ”
67893	67902	67794	67794	she	130	“ Hold on to your balls , man . ”
67911	67916	67727	67729	My old friend	143	“ Later , nerd . ”
67917	67920	67727	67729	My old friend	143	“ Later . ”
67971	67980	67991	67991	My	113	“ Bingley — call Hugh Major for me . ”
67981	67990	68002	68002	Hugh	2070	“ It would be my pleasure , sir . ”
68010	68015	68016	68020	the Bruisers ’ General Manager	1541	“ Hey , Nate , ”
68023	68028	68016	68020	the Bruisers ’ General Manager	1541	“ What ’s happening ? ”
68029	68059	68002	68002	Hugh	2070	“ I ’m going to pull Lauren out of the Bruisers ’ office for the week . Sorry for the short notice , but I need her in Manhattan . ”
68060	68066	68067	68067	He	2070	“ She ’ll be thrilled . ”
68070	68097	68098	68098	Hugh	2070	“ I know , right ? We probably wo n’t make it to Detroit this week . Can you get someone else to travel with you ? ”
68107	68139	68163	68163	He	2070	“ Sure . The timing works fine , anyway . Rebecca told me forty - eight hours ago that she was just cleared to come back to work part - time . ”
68140	68144	68163	68163	He	2070	“ She was ? ”
68157	68162	68163	68163	He	2070	“ Are you sure ? ”
68167	68186	68163	68163	He	2070	“ Of course I ’m sure . I have the doctor ’s note asking for a reduced schedule . ”
68187	68201	68202	68202	I	113	“ There ’s no such thing as a reduced schedule during the playoffs , ”
68221	68286	68331	68331	Rebecca	1114	“ Got it covered , okay ? I ’m assigning an intern to assist Rebecca full - time . We ’re bringing both of them with us to Detroit . The intern can cover the hours when Rebecca is resting . Do n’t worry about any of us or the team . We look good going into this series . The guys are ready . ”
68292	68307	68289	68289	they	2561	“ Go get ‘ em . See you in a few days , maybe . ”
68308	68311	68331	68331	Rebecca	1114	“ Later . ”
68398	68406	68393	68393	Silas	260	“ You ’re going down , captain . ”
68422	68432	68418	68420	the young goalie	1547	“ You little smack talker . Kick it already . ”
68576	68584	68585	68585	she	1029	“ Now now . No peekin ’ , ”
68634	68639	68640	68640	she	1029	“ Oh , mercy ! ”
68652	68657	68640	68640	she	1029	“ It ’s time ! ”
68671	68676	68677	68677	I	113	“ Okay , boys ! ”
68686	68691	68677	68677	I	113	“ Bus is waiting ! ”
68692	68699	68700	68700	Castro	1011	“ You hear that , O’Doul ? ”
68703	68720	68700	68700	Castro	1011	“ Becca needs you to miss this next point so we can go to the stadium . ”
68787	68793	68795	68799	the young woman beside me	1558	“ They ’re so dreamy , ”
68809	68834	68795	68799	the young woman beside me	1558	“ My mama would smack me for saying so , but I really want to climb Silas like a tree . Or maybe Castro . ”
69150	69154	69155	69156	the captain	143	“ Goddamn it , ”
69159	69166	69167	69167	Silas	260	“ Getting old sucks , man , ”
69174	69177	69178	69178	I	113	“ Guys , ”
69181	69200	69178	69178	I	113	“ Move it outside now before I have to open up a fresh can of whoop - ass . ”
69201	69208	69209	69209	O’Doul	125	“ We do n’t want that , ”
69212	69233	69209	69209	O’Doul	125	“ Let ’s go , men . We all know Silas would win again , anyway . He always does . ”
69288	69293	69305	69305	He	1011	“ Ready , miss ? ”
69332	69337	69338	69338	I	113	“ Let ’s go , ”
69432	69437	69438	69440	the security guy	1011	“ Okay , miss , ”
69443	69449	69438	69440	the security guy	1011	“ Here ’s your car . ”
69464	69469	69470	69472	Heidi Jo coos	1029	“ Oh ! Fancy , ”
69474	69492	69470	69472	Heidi Jo coos	1029	“ Have n’t ridden in one of these since prom night ! I had the cutest dress … ”
69559	69563	69564	69564	I	113	“ Hop in , ”
69703	69708	69709	69709	I	113	“ Um , hi , ”
69722	69725	69726	69726	he	1114	“ Rebecca , ”
69739	69743	69726	69726	he	1114	“ Good evening . ”
69768	69777	69778	69778	I	113	“ Did n’t expect to see you here , ”
69788	69797	69778	69778	I	113	“ I swung by to chat with Hugh . ”
69798	69801	69802	69802	I	113	“ Oh , ”
69858	69861	69862	69862	I	113	“ Sorry , ”
69907	69916	69917	69917	she	1029	“ Mr. Kattenberger , I ’m Heidi Jo , ”
69924	69935	69917	69917	she	1029	“ And I ’m such a big fan of yours . ”
69943	69947	69948	69948	he	1114	“ Thank you , ”
69959	69970	69971	69971	I	113	“ Heidi Jo is an intern in the front office , ”
69976	69989	69990	69990	she	1029	“ … And I am taking really good care of Miss Rowley ! ”
69993	70009	70041	70042	Miss Rowley	2523	“ It ’s a pleasure meeting you , and I ’m glad to hear that . ”
70027	70040	70021	70021	Nate	1114	“ Miss Rowley , do you have tonight ’s invite list handy ? ”
70143	70148	70149	70149	I	113	“ Let ’s see , ”
70152	70180	70149	70149	I	113	“ You invited two guys from Goldman Sachs — Kearns and Brown . You invited Stew and Seely and Marsha Ryan . Oh — and Alex Engels . ”
70268	70278	70279	70279	Nate	1114	“ How was your first week back at work ? ”
70291	70301	70285	70285	Grueling	266	“ It was lovely . Thank you for inquiring . ”
70302	70317	70318	70319	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I ’ve made sure she did n’t work too many hours in Detroit , ”
70323	70330	70318	70319	Heidi Jo	1029	“ She ’s doing first rate . ”
70331	70334	70335	70335	Nate	1114	“ Ah , ”
70338	70355	70335	70335	Nate	1114	“ Well done . Whatever we pay you , I ’m sure it is n’t enough . ”
70360	70385	70356	70357	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I think I might need hazard pay when Miss Rowley gets in one of her moods . She ’s a grumpy bear sometimes . ”
70386	70391	70392	70392	I	113	“ Is that so ? ”
70555	70558	70559	70560	the driver	2862	“ Ready ? ”
70569	70572	70573	70573	I	113	“ Wait … ”
70886	70895	70880	70880	Georgia	95	“ What the heck was that girl … ? ”
70896	70901	70902	70902	I	113	“ I ’m sorry , ”
70906	70918	70902	70902	I	113	“ I did n’t warn her to stay out of sight . ”
70919	70936	70937	70937	Georgia	95	“ I already have three texts from journalists wondering which college girl Nate Kattenberger is dating . ”
70953	70965	70966	70966	she	95	“ Maybe you should have gotten out of the car first , ”
70969	70976	70966	70966	she	95	“ Try that on for size . ”
70977	70982	70983	70983	I	113	“ You ’re hilarious , ”
70986	71017	70983	70983	I	113	“ Maybe on Monday I ’ll actually do that , just to complicate your life . You can try to kill the story that Nate only dates assistants and interns . ”
71018	71039	71040	71040	Georgia	95	“ And only people under five feet four inches tall . Billionaire romances the vertically challenged , film at eleven , ”
71043	71048	71049	71049	I	113	“ I hate you , ”
71154	71175	71136	71137	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Omigod , y’ all ! That was so nice of Mr. K to walk the red carpet with me ! ”
71176	71183	71184	71184	Georgia	95	“ Like he had a choice , ”
71190	71194	71196	71196	she	1029	“ Mr. K ? ”
71202	71209	71210	71211	my intern	1552	“ What do we do next ? ”
71214	71232	71233	71233	Georgia	95	“ We need to make sure you do n’t jump out of limos with the bossman again , ”
71236	71239	71240	71241	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Sorry , ”
71245	71249	71240	71241	Heidi Jo	1029	“ What else ? ”
71264	71294	71250	71250	Georgia	95	“ One more thing ? There ’s a reporter for Observer who ’s dying for an interview with Nate . But I find the whole thing a little weird . ”
71295	71299	71300	71300	I	113	“ Weird how ? ”
71316	71365	71303	71303	Georgia	95	“ I do n’t know this reporter very well . But she wants to write a story about why Nate bought a hockey franchise . But he wo n’t take the interview . Do you have any idea why ? You ’ve known him longer than I have . ”
71389	71425	71381	71381	I	113	“ When Nate bought the team , I was surprised . I did n’t know he was considering it . But I will say that our first office had a hockey poster on the wall . ”
71436	71443	71426	71426	I	113	“ The Blackhawks , I think ? ”
71504	71510	71511	71511	Georgia	95	“ The Blackhawks , huh ? ”
71518	71548	71511	71511	Georgia	95	“ I guess that makes sense . He would n’t have been a Minnesota fan , because that ’s an expansion team that formed after his family left Minnesota . ”
71549	71554	71511	71511	Georgia	95	“ Just ask him . ”
71555	71604	71511	71511	Georgia	95	“ He does n’t want to talk about it , but this reporter wo n’t go away . I get a weird feeling from her . Like she has some bit of gossip and wo n’t come clean . But I ca n’t figure out what it is . ”
71605	71610	71611	71611	I	113	“ That is weird , ”
71642	71663	71637	71639	rich white guys	1632	“ Maybe she ’s trying to spin it like Revenge of the Nerds . Brainiac enjoys brutality on the ice . ”
71664	71670	71671	71672	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Do n’t we all , ”
71685	71690	71678	71678	Georgia	95	“ Later , babe . ”
71691	71694	71695	71695	I	113	“ Later ! ”
71703	71737	71695	71695	I	113	“ I ’m going to check with the stadium staff to see if they have any notes for me . And make sure the players have everything they need in their dressing room . ”
71748	71754	71738	71739	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I volunteer as tribute . ”
71757	71776	71738	71739	Heidi Jo	1029	“ And then I ’ll look over the corporate box to make sure it ’s set up for … ”
71790	71795	71796	71796	I	113	“ Let ’s go , ”
71799	71804	71796	71796	I	113	“ Ticket booth first . ”
71818	71826	71827	71828	the intern	2903	“ When you say the corporate box ? ”
71831	71840	71827	71828	the intern	2903	“ Do you mean Mr. K ’s box ? ”
71863	71869	71856	71856	I	113	“ That ’s the one . ”
71870	71884	71844	71844	she	1029	“ Is it fancy ? I ’ve never met a billionaire before today . ”
71885	71892	71893	71893	I	113	“ He does n’t live there , ”
71896	71921	71893	71893	I	113	“ It ’s your usual rich guy decor . Velvet stadium seats . Paneled walls . Chandeliers . Exotic dancers on the half hour . ”
71922	71925	71844	71844	she	1029	“ What ? ”
71926	71943	71893	71893	I	113	“ Male and female . Do n’t tip them , though . They ’re on salary . ”
71957	71965	71944	71945	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Just kidding about that last thing . ”
71966	71972	71944	71945	Heidi Jo	1029	“ You do tip them ? ”
71976	72023	71974	71974	me	113	“ There are n’t any strippers . The hockey game is enough excitement . But there ’s champagne if we win , a hundred other beverages if we do n’t . Oh , and these warm cheese puffs that Georgia speed eats when she ’s tense . ”
72032	72041	72042	72043	Heidi Jo	1029	“ It ’s not nice to tease me , ”
72046	72051	72042	72043	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I ’m sorry . ”
72070	72076	72077	72077	she	1029	“ How are you feeling ? ”
72080	72083	72084	72084	I	113	“ Peachy . ”
72161	72167	72196	72196	She	1029	“ Does your head ache ? ”
72168	72175	72196	72196	She	1029	“ Nope . I ’m good . ”
72176	72184	72196	72196	She	1029	“ I could find you a snack … ”
72185	72195	72196	72196	She	1029	“ Heidi ? Stop it . I ’m fine . ”
72203	72211	72196	72196	She	1029	“ Okay . Just say the word . ”
72426	72430	72431	72431	I	113	“ COME ON ! ”
72443	72451	72431	72431	I	113	“ THAT ’S SOME BULLSHIT RIGHT THERE ! ”
72452	72456	72457	72458	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I agree , ”
72462	72476	72457	72458	Heidi Jo	1029	“ But my mama would slap me if I put it that way . ”
72608	72612	72613	72613	Stewie	117	“ Timing pool ! ”
72632	72637	72616	72616	He	1114	“ Who ’s in ? ”
72653	72661	72666	72666	he	1114	“ Twelve minutes , thirty six seconds , ”
72671	72674	72675	72676	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Ooh ! ”
72679	72684	72685	72685	She	1029	“ I love games . ”
72693	72699	72685	72685	She	1029	“ What am I guessing ? ”
72700	72712	72726	72726	she	1029	“ How long it takes the Zamboni to clear the ice . ”
72713	72716	72717	72717	Her	1029	“ Ah . ”
72742	72750	72726	72726	she	1029	“ Twelve minutes , thirty nine seconds . ”
72761	72771	72751	72751	Stew	143	“ Your intern is a fierce competitor , Bec . ”
72772	72777	72778	72779	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Who , me ? ”
72809	72821	72794	72794	She	1029	“ If you win , you have to buy lunch tomorrow . ”
72822	72825	72826	72826	Stew	143	“ Awesome ! ”
72835	72838	72839	72840	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Welp . ”
72844	72860	72839	72840	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I was just fixing to have a cocktail . Can I bring you anything ? ”
72861	72872	72875	72875	me	113	“ I did n’t know you drank , Heidi Jo . ”
72890	72897	72898	72898	She	1029	“ I meant a fruit cocktail ! ”
72920	72929	72917	72917	I	113	“ I would love a Coke . Thanks . ”
72993	73007	72990	72990	Stew	143	“ Twelve minutes , thirty four seconds ! Rebecca Rowley takes the pot ! ”
73028	73033	73015	73015	Stew	143	“ Congrats , Bec ! ”
73060	73071	73072	73073	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I guess you ’re the one buying lunch tomorrow , ”
73076	73079	73080	73080	I	113	“ Indeed , ”
73083	73088	73080	73080	I	113	“ Actually , here . ”
73100	73114	73089	73089	I	113	“ It ’s not really fair for the intern to lose her cash . ”
73131	73144	73123	73123	she	1029	“ Fair ’s fair . I ’ll prolly win the next one . ”
73168	73199	73162	73162	Stew	143	“ That was a close one , Bec . Three more seconds and you would have been tied . Do you think arm - wrestling would make a good tiebreaker ? ”
73200	73207	73208	73208	I	113	“ I could totally take her , ”
73215	73220	73221	73221	he	113	“ By the way , ”
73227	73248	73221	73221	he	113	“ That was nice of you to offer her the twenty back . But you know she can afford it . ”
73249	73253	73254	73254	I	113	“ I do ? ”
73293	73313	73287	73287	Stew	143	“ Come on , Bec . You do n’t miss much . She ’s the league commissioner ’s daughter . ”
73314	73317	73278	73278	she	1029	“ The … ”
73321	73328	73278	73278	she	1029	“ Of the NHL ? Really ? ”
73329	73359	73287	73287	Stew	143	“ Yup . Heidi Jo is Heidi Jo Pepper . Daddy got mad when she dropped out of Bryn Mawr so he sent her to work on a team . ”
73360	73368	73369	73369	Stew	143	“ Oh , hell . Lucky me . ”
73417	73430	73431	73431	I	113	“ Thank you very much ! That ’s so kind of you , ”
73441	73450	73434	73434	She	1552	“ What did that man just tell you ? ”
73451	73457	73458	73458	I	113	“ Hmm ? What man ? ”
73467	73512	73434	73434	She	1552	“ That lottery guy . He told you who my daddy is , right ? And now you ’re gon na be all extra nice . That ’s bullshit , Becca . I ’m just the intern . I do n’t need special treatment . ”
73515	73522	73513	73513	Whoops	278	“ Uh , okay . Sorry . ”
73567	73570	73523	73524	Heidi Jo	1029	“ sudden death ”
73619	73627	73628	73628	Stew	143	“ Better luck next time , boys , ”
73631	73634	73635	73635	Georgia	95	“ Nate , ”
73641	73648	73635	73635	Georgia	95	“ We ’ll need you downstairs . ”
73776	73780	73781	73781	Nate	1114	“ Miss Rowley . ”
73873	73880	73881	73881	I	113	“ Is there something you need ? ”
73888	73898	73881	73881	I	113	“ And what ’s with this Miss Rowley business ? ”
73924	73942	73921	73921	He	1114	“ I was only going to ask if you knew why Alex did n’t show up tonight . ”
73943	73946	73947	73947	I	113	“ No , ”
73951	73971	73947	73947	I	113	“ I have n’t heard from her . It was n’t me who put her on the invite list . ”
73972	73992	73921	73921	He	1114	“ I see . I guess I ’ll give her a call tomorrow and make sure she ’s okay . ”
73993	73998	73999	73999	I	113	“ Right . Okay . ”
74004	74008	73999	73999	I	113	“ Good night . ”
74014	74017	73921	73921	He	1114	“ And … ”
74020	74023	73999	73999	I	113	“ Yes ? ”
74024	74036	74037	74037	he	1114	“ I was n’t trying to be a heel . That … ”
74046	74061	74037	74037	he	1114	“ The eager intern called you Miss Rowley . I thought it sounded nice . ”
74062	74065	74066	74066	I	113	“ Nice , ”
74073	74084	74085	74085	I	113	“ To me it sounds like you forgot my name . ”
74153	74165	74141	74141	he	1114	“ That was n’t my intent . To make you uncomfortable . ”
74166	74176	74141	74141	he	1114	“ You ’re treating me like I have Ebola . ”
74201	74205	74206	74206	Nate	1114	“ Poor calibration , ”
74224	74227	74228	74228	He	1114	“ What ? ”
74281	74334	74363	74363	Nate	1114	“ It ’s taken me longer than I ’d hoped to recalibrate my reaction to you . My apologies , Rebecca . You were right when you pointed out that this is your place of work , and that it would be wrong to pursue you here . And I have n’t . ”
74342	74358	74335	74335	I	113	“ So this whole Mr. Darcy routine is not because you ’re mad at me ? ”
74359	74362	74363	74363	Nate	1114	“ No . ”
74376	74386	74363	74363	Nate	1114	“ Not mad at you . Not at all . ”
74464	74477	74516	74516	He	1114	“ Look . I ’m sorry I screwed up your … calibration . ”
74478	74491	74516	74516	He	1114	“ It ’s entirely my own fault . We discussed this already . ”
74492	74496	74497	74497	I	113	“ Not exactly , ”
74500	74515	74497	74497	I	113	“ I never let you tell me what you thought about the whole thing . ”
74522	74540	74516	74516	He	1114	“ By whole thing are you referring to a very hot night in Bal Harbour , Florida ? ”
74541	74547	74516	74516	He	1114	“ Of course I am ! ”
74558	74620	74548	74548	He	1114	“ But it does n’t matter what I think . The guy who owns your place of employment ca n’t say what he feels . I do n’t want to look like that guy . I do n’t want to be that guy . And now we know my poker face needs work . So I ’ll get right on that . ”
74652	74655	74656	74656	I	113	“ Nate , ”
74659	74702	74656	74656	I	113	“ Tell me what would ’ve happened if you were n’t my boss for seven years . Or even — what if I did n’t say no to breakfast that morning . What would you have said to me over hotel coffee ? ”
74703	74708	74709	74709	He	1114	“ Something awkward probably . ”
74714	74773	74709	74709	He	1114	“ Look , there are no hypotheticals . You were never just some girl I met at a party . So do n’t ask me to tell you what I think . Not if a little awkwardness sends you into a tailspin . Because I do n’t think you ’re ready for what I ’d have to say . ”
74774	74777	74778	74778	My	113	“ But … ”
74797	74834	74783	74783	I	113	“ What if I had n’t given you a long speech about how the whole thing was a huge mistake ? What would you have said if I let you talk ? Do you even know ? ”
74835	74841	74842	74842	He	1671	“ Of course I know . ”
74855	74879	74842	74842	He	1671	“ I ’ve thought about it every ten minutes since . I ’ve thought about us during conference calls and while watching hockey . ”
74894	74907	74886	74886	Nate	1114	“ I thought about us on the Gulfstream and also in bed . ”
74932	74937	74938	74938	I	113	“ What about us ? ”
74941	74961	74962	74962	He	1671	“ What do you think ? In my imagination we are n’t reviewing spreadsheets , that ’s for sure . ”
74972	74989	74990	74990	He	1671	“ The only office furniture in this scenario is the desk I ’m bending you over . ”
74995	75021	74990	74990	He	1671	“ Does that answer the question ? Or should I go on about what color dress you ’re wearing when I lift it up and … ”
75041	75049	75031	75031	I	113	“ I think I get the idea . ”
75050	75062	75063	75063	Whew	280	“ And that ’s just off the top of my head . ”
75065	75081	75063	75063	Whew	280	“ That , uh , jives pretty well with my own thoughts on the matter . ”
75082	75085	75086	75086	His	1671	“ Really ? ”
75090	75100	75086	75086	His	1671	“ Then why are we avoiding each other instead ? ”
75101	75156	75031	75031	I	113	“ Because it would be fun , but fun ends . Think about it . You ’d run to the end of your playbook pretty quickly and then everything would be doubly awkward . Once you thought it through , you ’d decide we needed to just forget about the whole thing , too . ”
75157	75162	75163	75163	he	1671	“ No fucking way , ”
75167	75178	75163	75163	he	1671	“ When did you get to be such a pessimist ? ”
75179	75183	75184	75184	I	113	“ Since birth , ”
75188	75194	75184	75184	I	113	“ Have you met me ? ”
75195	75204	75205	75205	he	1671	“ You ’re not a pessimist , Bec , ”
75213	75262	75205	75205	he	1671	“ You love everyone , except maybe your intern . You planned Georgia ’s wedding like she ’s royalty . The whole fucking team would lie down in the road for you . That ’s not pessimism . That ’s why I do n’t quite buy it now . ”
75263	75266	75267	75267	My	113	“ Well … ”
75281	75292	75272	75272	I	113	“ Maybe I just ca n’t imagine a nice ending . ”
75293	75309	75387	75387	He	1671	“ Do you always plan your escape route first when you ’re interested in someone ? ”
75316	75324	75310	75310	He	1671	“ I ’m never interested in someone . ”
75338	75345	75310	75310	He	1671	“ Are you interested in me ? ”
75346	75382	75272	75272	I	113	“ Were you not listening when I just described how very interesting to me you are ? If I had my way , though , the next thing that happened between us would be dinner . ”
75383	75386	75310	75310	He	1671	“ Dinner ? ”
75392	75436	75387	75387	He	1671	“ You know . Food consumed near the end of the day ? At a restaurant , because I do n’t cook . Candlelight . You in a low - cut sweater . That ’s what I would have asked for over breakfast . ”
75444	75450	75437	75437	I	113	“ Like , a date ? ”
75451	75457	75458	75458	He	1671	“ Like , fer sure . ”
75468	75488	75465	75465	I	113	“ That ’s really sweet . I ’m sorry I threw it back in your face without even asking . ”
75489	75493	75494	75494	he	1671	“ Come here , ”
75533	75545	75512	75512	I	113	“ Everything got really tangled up there , did n’t it ? ”
75546	75549	75550	75550	I	113	“ Yes , ”
75566	75575	75576	75576	he	1671	“ I ’m sorry to ever distress you , ”
75579	75587	75576	75576	he	1671	“ You mean a lot to me . ”
75603	75636	75599	75599	I	113	“ I think I went a little crazy , Nate . You mean a lot to me , too . But so does my job . How did we get so complicated ? ”
75637	75643	75677	75682	a guy who gives great hugs	1673	“ Everything worthwhile is complicated . ”
75744	75756	75694	75694	he	1671	“ Y’all are needed at the press conference , Mr. K ! ”
75765	75771	75694	75694	he	1671	“ Oh gosh — sorry ! ”
75804	75811	75812	75812	Nate	1114	“ Be there in a sec , ”
76131	76144	76118	76119	the crowd	882	“ Mr. Kattenberger , how do you feel about your team ’s … ”
76145	76150	76118	76119	the crowd	882	“ Mr. Kattenberger … ! ”
76229	76233	76234	76234	Ramesh	107	“ Rough game , ”
76241	76257	76234	76234	Ramesh	107	“ Eh . We can rebuild it . Hey man — one stop before home ? ”
76258	76262	76263	76263	he	107	“ Hit me , ”
76332	76335	76336	76336	Rebecca	2523	“ Hello ? ”
76345	76350	76351	76351	I	113	“ It ’s me . ”
76354	76413	76351	76351	I	113	“ Look , I ’m sorry it ’s so late . I said I would n’t be that creepy guy . And now here I am standing on your doorstep at midnight . Nothing creepy at all about that , right ? You were probably asleep and dreaming about sweaters or something and I wrecked it . Again . ”
76441	76524	76351	76351	I	113	“ But , anyway , our conversation got interrupted at just the wrong time . Or at least I thought it was the wrong time . I just wanted to say that if you ever want to finish that conversation , I ’m here for that . Not literally . I wo n’t show up at midnight every night until you decide to either talk to me or call HR . But if the mood ever strikes , just say the word . ”
76611	76615	76616	76616	Rebecca	2523	“ Hi there , ”
76622	76625	76634	76634	she	2523	“ Hi . ”
76661	76670	76671	76671	I	113	“ That ’s a new look for you , ”
76682	76690	76691	76691	she	2523	“ This is Renny ’s trench coat , ”
76694	76717	76691	76691	she	2523	“ While you ’ve already seen my tiny pajamas , I did n’t want to give the rest of Brooklyn the pleasure . ”
76718	76727	76728	76729	Her nephew	1692	“ I meant the , uh , baby . ”
76761	76772	76746	76746	I	113	“ Did I wake him up ? Are you babysitting ? ”
76773	76780	76781	76781	Becca	2523	“ He ’s a night owl . ”
76786	76821	76781	76781	Becca	2523	“ Renny and Missy are home , too . It ’s just that they ’re having very loud sex right now in their bedroom . That ’s why I did n’t invite you up . ”
76852	76859	76860	76860	I	113	“ Listen , I should go , ”
76864	76885	76860	76860	I	113	“ I ’m sorry our conversation was interrupted earlier . Do you want me to say anything to that intern ? ”
76886	76889	76890	76890	Rebecca	2523	“ No . ”
76895	76901	76890	76890	Rebecca	2523	“ I ’ll handle it . ”
76902	76974	76860	76860	I	113	“ Well . Just say the word . But I really came here to say that my dinner invitation does n’t expire , okay ? If you should decide a month from now that the idea is n’t as hateful as you originally thought , just let me know . I ’m not going to ask again , though . Just to stay on the right side of the creepy line . ”
76975	76980	76981	76981	Her	2523	“ Oh , Nate ! ”
77010	77023	77002	77002	I	113	“ You could never be creepy . It is n’t like that . ”
77024	77029	77032	77033	the baby	372	“ Good to know . ”
77062	77067	77068	77068	she	2523	“ I want to , ”
77072	77075	77068	77068	she	2523	“ Hmm ? ”
77076	77084	77043	77043	he	372	“ Dinner . I want to go . ”
77085	77088	77068	77068	she	2523	“ Really ? ”
77099	77124	77125	77125	She	2523	“ Yeah . But it has to be our little secret . I ’m , um , just trying to feel my way here . ”
77151	77154	77155	77155	I	113	“ Okay , ”
77159	77165	77155	77155	I	113	“ You ’re the boss . ”
77193	77197	77198	77198	I	113	“ Of this , ”
77207	77213	77198	77198	I	113	“ How ’s tomorrow night ? ”
77217	77234	77214	77214	She	2523	“ Okay . Sure . I ’m still not sure this is n’t a bad idea . ”
77235	77249	77269	77269	She	2523	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll sell you on all the perks . ”
77301	77311	77312	77312	I	113	“ Well , I ’m going to run along , ”
77340	77346	77334	77336	the other party	1697	“ See you at seven ? ”
77347	77350	77351	77351	she	2523	“ Seven , ”
77361	77376	77334	77336	the other party	1697	“ Sorry I ’ve been — what did you call it ? Mr. Darcy ? ”
77377	77384	77385	77385	She	2523	“ Yeah , you ’re all … ”
77396	77404	77385	77385	She	2523	“ … Chilly . Or maybe constipated . ”
77603	77615	77598	77598	Rebecca	2523	“ That ’s it . I ca n’t eat another bite . ”
77632	77635	77636	77636	Nate	1114	“ Quitter . ”
77758	77773	77753	77753	Nate	1114	“ Nice pick , Nate . But I would have been happy with anything . ”
77774	77777	77778	77778	he	1114	“ What ? ”
77794	77803	77778	77778	he	1114	“ You with the deep opinions about falafel ? ”
77804	77809	77810	77810	I	113	“ Okay — fine . ”
77816	77833	77810	77810	I	113	“ Not just anything . But you do n’t have to impress me with gourmet extravagance . ”
77844	77901	77834	77834	He	1114	“ You think I do n’t know that ? You ’re fun , Bec . Next month I ’m going to China with Lauren , and she wo n’t eat the street food I ’m going to want to try . You ’ve always had a good sense of adventure . I love that about you . ”
78004	78008	78009	78009	I	113	“ You know … ”
78014	78023	78009	78009	I	113	“ This is its own kind of adventure . ”
78024	78027	78028	78028	he	1114	“ Exactly , ”
78036	78086	78028	78028	he	1114	“ And that ’s why we ’re here tonight and not at the falafel shop . I ’m not trying to wow you with the twenty - dollar dessert . Although it was exquisite . I ’m only trying to show you that tonight is not business as usual . ”
78194	78200	78191	78192	Smart man	1711	“ Okay , adventure guy . ”
78207	78214	78201	78201	I	113	“ Are you ready to go ? ”
78300	78312	78289	78289	I	113	“ Where ’s Ramesh ? Are you giving him the slip ? ”
78313	78316	78317	78317	Nate	1114	“ No . ”
78328	78336	78317	78317	Nate	1114	“ I gave him the night off . ”
78337	78345	78289	78289	I	113	“ Really ? Can you do that ? ”
78346	78381	78382	78382	He	1114	“ Sure . I mean — some other member of my security team is likely watching a dot move on a screen somewhere , tracking my movements . There is always someone paying attention . ”
78390	78401	78382	78382	He	1114	“ That ’s not a selling point , is it ? ”
78402	78405	78413	78413	He	1114	“ What ? ”
78406	78412	78413	78413	He	1114	“ Surveillance is so sexy . ”
78501	78532	78487	78487	He	1114	“ Ramesh has the night off because I knew if I asked him to drive us back to my place , you would have trouble looking him in the eye . ”
78539	78587	78533	78533	I	113	“ … I also asked one of Lauren ’s minions to make our dinner reservation , because if I had asked Lauren , she would ’ve made me tell her who I was dining with . And you made it clear how you feel about office gossip . ”
78588	78607	78608	78608	I	113	“ That ’s very thoughtful of you . And lovely of you to remain my dirty little secret . ”
78629	78643	78621	78621	He	1717	“ You can do that now without losing your balance . Well done . ”
78658	78672	78655	78655	Nate	1114	“ I ’m never stepping out on that ice again . Just saying . ”
78756	78761	78762	78762	Bingley	143	“ Evening , Nate ! ”
78766	78769	78770	78770	he	1114	“ Evening , ”
78785	78800	78801	78801	He	1114	“ I put some of that Mexican soda you like in the den refrigerator . ”
78805	78809	78801	78801	He	1114	“ Want one ? ”
78810	78813	78814	78814	I	113	“ Sure ! ”
78847	78868	78869	78869	I	113	“ God , I ca n’t wait until I can just have a glass of wine like a normal person . ”
78908	78916	78917	78917	I	113	“ This is probably a bad idea , ”
78978	78982	78983	78983	he	1114	“ Everything okay ? ”
78986	78991	78992	78992	I	113	“ Yes and no , ”
78995	79017	79018	79018	Nate	1114	“ I just want to do the smart thing . And sometimes it ’s not easy to know what that is . ”
79032	79045	79018	79018	Nate	1114	“ You think I ’m a bad idea . You ’re right . ”
79046	79050	79051	79051	He	1114	“ I am ? ”
79106	79140	79100	79100	he	1114	“ Very bad . Because I want to do bad , bad things to you . Naughty things . And if you ’re not on board with that , better say so now . ”
79141	79147	79148	79148	I	113	“ What kind of things ? ”
79155	79161	79162	79162	he	1114	“ I could tell you , ”
79169	79200	79162	79162	he	1114	“ If you have a half hour or so . Because I ’m very detail - oriented . In fact , there ’s a PowerPoint presentation I ’ve put together … ”
79214	79219	79220	79220	he	1114	“ Not too long , ”
79227	79233	79220	79220	he	1114	“ Fifty slides or so . ”
79234	79241	79242	79242	I	113	“ Are there charts and graphs ? ”
79271	79289	79259	79259	Nate	1114	“ There are four diagrams , drawn from my fantasies . And also specs and performance estimates . ”
79290	79295	79296	79296	I	113	“ Oh , Nate , ”
79299	79305	79296	79296	I	113	“ Do n’t ever change . ”
79616	79619	79620	79620	Nate	1114	“ Seriously ? ”
79638	79685	79627	79627	Ramesh	107	“ Two heat signatures . If you were on , say , a sofa right now , I would n’t have been confused . But on the stairs ? Looked like a struggle . And you did n’t engage the security systems like you always do . ”
79686	79690	79691	79691	Nate	1114	“ Forgot to , ”
79702	79705	79706	79706	Ramesh	107	“ Bye , ”
79709	79728	79729	79729	He	107	“ Lock up after me . We ’ll discuss security protocols tomorrow . You can tweak some things . ”
79744	79749	79737	79737	Nate	1114	“ I ’m sorry … ”
79750	79754	79755	79755	I	113	“ I know , ”
79762	79776	79755	79755	I	113	“ This will probably be funny eventually . But I need a minute . ”
79777	79782	79783	79783	he	107	“ I ’ll bet , ”
79837	79841	79831	79831	I	113	“ You okay ? ”
79842	79869	79898	79898	She	2523	“ Yup . Just sore . This morning I went to a Pilates class that Ari recommended . My abs and glutes may never forgive me . ”
79876	79897	79898	79898	She	2523	“ Come on , there ’s something I want to show you . And it is n’t a security feature . ”
79931	79936	79937	79937	Bingley	143	“ Evening , Nate ! ”
79947	79950	79951	79951	I	113	“ Evening , ”
79954	79960	79951	79951	I	113	“ Engage all security systems . ”
79961	79966	79937	79937	Bingley	143	“ Roger , Roger ! ”
79967	79975	79976	79976	Becca	2523	“ So I ’m not leaving tonight ? ”
80002	80008	80010	80010	I	113	“ Do you want to ? ”
80070	80075	80076	80076	he	143	“ Hullo , Rebecca ! ”
80079	80090	80076	80076	he	143	“ It ’s good to hear your voice , lass ! ”
80091	80094	80095	80095	she	2523	“ Mmm , ”
80101	80108	80095	80095	she	2523	“ Hello to you , too . ”
80115	80118	80111	80111	I	113	“ Soda ? ”
80119	80125	80126	80126	She	2523	“ Sure , why not . ”
80142	80146	80129	80129	I	113	“ Follow me . ”
80164	80170	80111	80111	I	113	“ Where are we going ? ”
80171	80183	80184	80184	I	113	“ You said something about muscle pain ? You ’ll see . ”
80199	80203	80204	80204	Becca	2523	“ Nice basement , ”
80211	80219	80204	80204	Becca	2523	“ It ’s not really below ground . ”
80326	80331	80332	80332	Becca	2523	“ Oh , wow , ”
80335	80338	80339	80339	She	2523	“ Fancy . ”
80355	80374	80375	80375	She	2523	“ I still do n’t always trust my balance . If I fall in , do n’t laugh . ”
80384	80387	80352	80352	she	2523	“ Nice . ”
80405	80415	80388	80388	I	113	“ You can sit and put your feet in . ”
80564	80569	80548	80548	she	2523	“ Ah . Wow . ”
80580	80587	80570	80570	She	2523	“ Nice place you got here . ”
80588	80593	80594	80594	I	113	“ Is n’t it ? ”
80635	80664	80631	80631	Rebecca	2523	“ You did n’t ! I have n’t heard this playlist in forever . But I ’ll bet I still know every transition . Lady Gaga is next . ”
80665	80670	80631	80631	Rebecca	2523	“ She sure is . ”
80680	80689	80671	80671	Rebecca	2523	“ I have a little confession to make . ”
80690	80695	80696	80696	I	113	“ What ’s that ? ”
80706	80709	80710	80710	She	2523	“ Well … ”
80716	80732	80710	80710	She	2523	“ I used to have a crush on you . Back in the early days . ”
80741	80751	80733	80733	My	113	“ Get out of town . You did not . ”
80752	80759	80760	80760	Her	2523	“ No , I really did . ”
80765	80802	80760	80760	Her	2523	“ That first year especially . But you were taken , and you were my boss . Those two things made it pretty easy to tamp down , when you ’re a practical girl like me . ”
80829	80838	80821	80821	I	113	“ So how does that work , exactly ? ”
80839	80842	80843	80843	She	2523	“ What ? ”
80862	80900	80821	80821	I	113	“ How do you stop wanting someone ? I ’m a practical person , but I do n’t see how that makes it any easier . Nothing seems to mute the raging attraction I have for you . ”
80991	80997	80979	80979	Her	2523	“ This is like Twister . ”
80998	81003	81004	81004	I	113	“ It ’s better , ”
81019	81029	81007	81008	Lady Gaga	287	“ Are we getting into this pool or what ? ”
81038	81052	81030	81030	Becca	2523	“ I ’m tempted . But I do n’t have a bathing suit . ”
81053	81058	81030	81030	Becca	2523	“ Oh , snap . ”
81066	81073	81059	81059	She	287	“ Are you really getting in ? ”
81074	81081	81082	81082	I	113	“ We do n’t have to . ”
81101	81110	81090	81090	Her	2523	“ But this is an adventure , right ? ”
81111	81114	81115	81115	I	113	“ Right . ”
81136	81139	81129	81129	I	113	“ What ? ”
81140	81152	81153	81153	She	2523	“ Just wondering what else you ’re going to take off . ”
81156	81160	81153	81153	She	2523	“ Come here . ”
81187	81198	81199	81199	She	2523	“ You tell me . What am I taking off ? ”
81239	81246	81249	81249	Her	2523	“ will we or wo n’t we ”
81259	81271	81249	81249	Her	2523	“ I ’m not getting in the water unless you are . ”
81367	81372	81361	81361	I	113	“ Undo my belt . ”
81497	81504	81505	81505	she	2523	“ You dressed up for dinner , ”
81508	81513	81505	81505	she	2523	“ No hoodie tonight ? ”
81527	81543	81544	81544	I	113	“ There ’s a different outfit I ’d rather wear when I ’m with you , ”
81591	81600	81587	81587	her	2523	“ Can I take this off of you ? ”
81601	81604	81605	81605	she	2523	“ Yes , ”
81647	81650	81651	81651	I	113	“ Jesus , ”
81905	81922	81900	81900	Her	2523	“ I ’m a fan of this setup . Do you use this tub very often ? ”
81923	81947	81948	81948	I	113	“ Yes and no . I use it as a lap pool twice a week . Always alone . So this is new . ”
81973	82002	81965	81965	She	2523	“ But I figure — what ’s the point of having this crazy house if you never skinny - dip in the hot tub with your favorite girl ? ”
82007	82021	82003	82003	Her	2523	“ This is fun . But I ’m not used to it yet . ”
82029	82039	82022	82022	She	2523	“ I know . You still have your doubts . ”
82040	82047	82048	82048	she	2523	“ Not about you , though , ”
82059	82065	82048	82048	she	2523	“ It ’s just complicated . ”
82133	82143	82144	82144	she	2523	“ This is really nice on the sore muscles , ”
82151	82169	82170	82170	She	2523	“ What exactly is sore ? I ’ll massage it . Please say it ’s your glutes . ”
82173	82178	82170	82170	She	2523	“ Close . Hamstrings . ”
82179	82191	82170	82170	She	2523	“ As if I needed a reason to touch your thighs . ”
82206	82209	82210	82210	she	2523	“ Oy , ”
82213	82221	82210	82210	she	2523	“ Okay , that ’s sore too . ”
82222	82225	82170	82170	She	2523	“ Sorry . ”
82231	82279	82226	82226	She	2523	“ It ’s a good kind of sore . I was so happy when Dr. Armitage said that lying around in dark rooms was n’t going to help me get better . It ’s good to move around , because I feel like I ’m accomplishing something . ”
82301	82308	82294	82294	Rebecca	2523	“ Swing a leg over here . ”
82353	82359	82334	82334	She	2523	“ That feels so good . ”
82519	82525	82526	82526	I	113	“ Hey , nice turtle , ”
82540	82543	82544	82544	he	1114	“ Hmm ? ”
82554	82569	82570	82570	I	113	“ You have an inflatable turtle , Nate . It ’s smiling at me . ”
82583	82586	82587	82587	he	1114	“ Ah , ”
82596	82602	82587	82587	he	1114	“ Gag gift from Alex . ”
82621	82634	82637	82637	myself	113	“ She seemed pissed off at you that night at the party , ”
82640	82646	82647	82647	He	1114	“ She was , right ? ”
82659	82688	82647	82647	He	1114	“ That was sort of weird . I think she ’s ducking me . Probably has something to do with a deal I have going on at work . ”
82689	82692	82693	82693	I	113	“ Hmm . ”
82704	82720	82693	82693	I	113	“ Can I ask you a question ? Were you and Alex ever a thing ? ”
82721	82725	82726	82726	he	1114	“ A thing , ”
82730	82736	82726	82726	he	1114	“ No . Not really . ”
82737	82741	82752	82752	He	1114	“ Not really ? ”
82757	82777	82752	82752	He	1114	“ Once we got drunk and fooled around . But never again . We ’re better off as friends . ”
83061	83066	83067	83067	he	1114	“ You ruin me , ”
83116	83121	83122	83122	he	1114	“ Fuck , Bec , ”
83126	83131	83122	83122	he	1114	“ Sit up here . ”
83132	83135	83136	83136	He	1114	“ What ? ”
83143	83148	83136	83136	He	1114	“ No , wait . ”
83193	83196	83197	83197	I	113	“ Oh , ”
83241	83244	83230	83230	His	1114	“ Ungh , ”
83256	83264	83282	83282	Nate	1114	“ Rebecca , are you all right ? ”
83319	83322	83323	83323	I	113	“ Oh , ”
83415	83420	83421	83421	I	113	“ Do n’t stop , ”
83424	83427	83428	83428	Bingley	143	“ Stop ? ”
83431	83440	83428	83428	Bingley	143	“ I did n’t get that , Rebecca . ”
83441	83446	83447	83447	Nate	1114	“ SILENCE , Bingley , ”
83523	83528	83515	83515	I	113	“ Should n’t we … ”
83547	83556	83557	83557	I	113	“ Let ’s get out of the pool , ”
83560	83564	83565	83565	he	113	“ We will , ”
83586	83592	83593	83593	he	113	“ Come on my tongue , ”
83596	83613	83593	83593	he	113	“ And then I ’ll take you upstairs and make you come again on my cock . ”
83829	83835	83836	83836	he	1114	“ Where are you going ? ”

84892	84912	84913	84913	He	1114	“ Fuck it , Bec . I thought my fantasies were good , but you blow them all away . ”
84928	84934	84913	84913	He	1114	“ Tell me another palindrome . ”

85354	85371	85348	85348	he	1114	“ God , Bec . There are n’t words for how spoiled you make me feel . ”
85397	85406	85389	85389	He	1114	“ The no - condom thing is new . ”

85438	85449	85431	85431	They	1780	“ Maybe that ’s why you like it so much . ”
85455	85485	85450	85450	He	1114	“ No , that ’s why it does n’t last as long as I ’d like it to . But you ’re the reason I like it so much . ”
85516	85526	85527	85527	Becca	1114	“ I ’m not meeting him at the door , ”

85646	85654	85655	85655	she	1782	“ See me or see me naked , ”
85661	85677	85614	85614	she	1782	“ I meant the first thing , but the second thing sounds good , too . ”
85678	85705	85655	85655	she	1782	“ Tonight ’s game , maybe ? But I wo n’t be in the box . I ’m watching with Georgia from Coach ’s comp seats . ”
85706	85709	85710	85710	I	113	“ Okay . ”

85747	85754	85655	85655	she	1782	“ I ’ll make a reservation . ”
85761	85774	85755	85755	She	1782	“ You mean you ’ll ask someone to make it for you . ”
85775	85803	85736	85736	She	1782	“ You never know . I can probably figure out how it works . For you , baby , I ’ll do it . Hey , Bingley ? ”
85804	85810	85755	85755	She	1782	“ Yes , my lord . ”
85811	85820	85736	85736	She	1782	“ How do you make a restaurant reservation ? ”
86068	86071	86072	86072	she	1788	“ Nathan , ”
86194	86202	86187	86187	I	113	“ Hey , you got a second ? ”
86203	86217	86218	86218	He	1796	“ Sure . But are n’t I meeting with you in fifteen minutes ? ”
86221	86237	86218	86218	He	1796	“ Yeah , but not about this . This is a closed - door conversation . ”
86238	86243	86244	86244	I	113	“ Uh - oh . ”
86253	86259	86244	86244	I	113	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
86260	86276	86218	86218	He	1796	“ I got a call from this kid Mickey down in the AI research division . ”
86277	86283	86284	86284	Stewie	117	“ You did ? Why ? ”
86309	86346	86218	86218	He	1796	“ He and I play squash on Thursdays . His backhand makes me feel like an old geezer . Anyway , he knows you and I are close , and he wanted my advice about something . ”
86347	86352	86353	86353	Stew	143	“ Okay — what ? ”
86368	86393	86358	86358	I	113	“ Well , think about it . He studies the audio files from your module at home . And suddenly they ’re full of … ”
86394	86399	86353	86353	Stew	143	“ Oh , fuck . ”
86400	86403	86404	86404	Stew	143	“ Exactly . ”
86486	86497	86474	86474	she	140	“ I hope you told him to delete those files ? ”
86498	86561	86474	86474	she	140	“ Yup . And then I told him to set it up so that you need to okay each day ’s interactions . You ’re going to get an email every morning . If you push a button in that email to send him the files , he ’ll hear them . If you delete the email , the files stay private . ”
86562	86565	86566	86566	I	113	“ Okay , ”
86569	86575	86566	86566	I	113	“ Thanks for handling it . ”
86576	86581	86582	86582	He	113	“ You ’re welcome ! ”
86585	86596	86582	86582	He	113	“ Notice I ’m not judging you for their content . ”
86597	86617	86474	86474	she	140	“ That ’s because you did n’t hear them . I did some of my best work this week . ”
86618	86644	86582	86582	He	113	“ Congratulations . Can I assume that the beneficiary of your efforts is a certain Bruisers employee ? Or did you take your ambitions elsewhere ? ”
86645	86660	86474	86474	she	140	“ No . It ’s her . No need to lecture me , though . ”
86661	86683	86582	86582	He	113	“ Do you hear a lecture ? However you two worked it out , I ’m sure you made HR proud . ”
86684	86702	86474	86474	she	140	“ They would n’t be wildly excited about the whole thing . But it was her decision . ”
86703	86713	86714	86714	Stew	143	“ Hey — I do n’t have any doubt . ”
86719	86739	86714	86714	Stew	143	“ I hope this sticks , man . You deserve someone who can put up with your dorky ass . ”
86740	86748	86749	86749	I	113	“ It ’s no dorkier than yours , ”
86752	86761	86762	86762	he	143	“ A nut for a jar of tuna , ”
86779	86791	86762	86762	he	143	“ I ’m happy for you . When ’s the wedding ? ”
86795	86819	86792	86792	I	113	“ Baby steps . First I have to convince her that the world wo n’t end if other people know we ’re together . ”
86820	86846	86792	86792	I	113	“ Smart girl . The practical implications of dating you are n’t really so great . Are you going to put a bodyguard on her ? ”
86847	86857	86792	86792	I	113	“ Ugh . No . She ’d hate that . ”
86867	86874	86858	86860	My best friend	397	“ It ’ll come up someday . ”
86875	86883	86792	86792	I	113	“ What are you , my mother ? ”
86884	86904	86858	86860	My best friend	397	“ Please . If I was I would n’t have started the conversation congratulating you on your sex life . ”
86905	86923	86792	86792	I	113	“ Are you coming down the hall to meet with the tax guys now , or what ? ”
86924	86930	86858	86860	My best friend	397	“ See you in ten . ”
87579	87583	87584	87585	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Oh my , ”
87605	87610	87611	87611	Hugh	2070	“ Ready , ladies ? ”
87620	87623	87624	87624	I	113	“ Absolutely , ”
87732	87737	87738	87739	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Oh , honey ! ”
87744	87749	87738	87739	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Are you okay ? ”
87750	87753	87759	87759	Hugh	2070	“ Fine ! ”
87779	87790	87791	87791	he	2070	“ Working lunch with the boys in thirty , right ? ”
87795	87798	87799	87799	My	113	“ Right . ”
87803	87825	87799	87799	My	113	“ I ’m going to call the caterer right now and make sure everything is a go . See you inside ? ”
87885	87888	87889	87890	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Well ? ”
87895	87904	87889	87890	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Is this because you ’re shaky today ? ”
87905	87917	87919	87919	I	113	“ It ’ll be fine . And I ’m not shaky . ”
88127	88130	88131	88131	I	113	“ Okay , ”
88142	88171	88131	88131	I	113	“ They ’re en route , but hit traffic . They ’ll be ten minutes late . Let ’s go tell Jimbo so he can watch for them . ”
88172	88175	88176	88176	she	1029	“ Roger , ”
88250	88257	88258	88258	he	1847	“ Players only beyond this point , ”
88273	88290	88266	88266	our	1846	“ If you ’ll step aside I ’ll show you that my card opens the door . ”
88317	88321	88314	88314	my	113	“ Heidi Jo ? ”
88334	88345	88322	88322	She	1029	“ Sorry , miss . Players only beyond this point . ”
88346	88358	88359	88359	I	113	“ Please let her try her card ? Or radio inside , ”
88363	88390	88359	88359	I	113	“ I ’m the assistant to Hugh Major , the General Manager , and he ’s expecting us . I can show you my Bruisers ID … ”
88397	88427	88391	88391	He	294	“ Listen , girls . This might work for you sometimes , but not on my watch . I know it ’s fun to stalk the players , but … ”
88428	88434	88435	88435	I	113	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
88438	88457	88435	88435	I	113	“ We ’re not … stalking the team . We work for the team . It ’s different ! ”
88481	88486	88487	88488	the guy	517	“ No girlfriends neither , ”
88520	88560	88561	88561	She	1029	“ How ‘ bout I call the G.M. out here to vouch for us ? He ’s rully busy but he ’s likely getting impatient without us so I ’m sure he ’d be willing to answer your questions . ”
88615	88624	88625	88625	She	1029	“ Lemme see your ID again , miss ? ”
88675	88683	88684	88684	he	517	“ Imma think about it a minute , ”

88719	88722	88723	88723	she	1029	“ Easy , ”
88726	88732	88723	88723	she	1029	“ I ’ve got this . ”
88743	88748	88733	88733	I	113	“ You ’re right , ”
88758	88774	88749	88749	I	113	“ You ’re sugar - on - top routine is working better than my sass . ”
88790	88807	88808	88808	She	1029	“ I saw you do the same thing just last week . Learning from the master . ”
88829	88853	88820	88820	She	1029	“ I ’m fixing to call in the big guns before an entire hockey team misses lunch . They ’ll be rully upset . ”
89046	89050	89051	89051	Nate	1114	“ Miss Rowley , ”
89075	89089	89090	89090	He	294	“ Miss Pepper . What are we doing standing around the back entrance ? ”

89200	89211	89212	89213	Heidi Jo	1029	“ We were just about to outsmart ‘ i m , ”
89216	89223	89224	89224	he	1114	“ I ’m sure you were , ”
89272	89284	89285	89285	she	1029	“ I just remembered a little errand I have to run , ”
89288	89296	89298	89298	she	1029	“ If you ’ll both excuse me . ”
89419	89423	89424	89424	I	113	“ Mr. Kattenberger , ”
89427	89436	89424	89424	I	113	“ This is hardly the time or place . ”
89437	89441	89442	89442	he	1114	“ I know , ”
89447	89454	89455	89455	He	1114	“ That makes it extra fun . ”

89621	89647	89603	89603	He	1114	“ You keep saying that . And I do enjoy your nakedness . But I miss you , and you wo n’t text with me . ”
89648	89690	89605	89605	his	1114	“ That ’s because Heidi Jo takes my phone away from me whenever she thinks I ’ve had too much screen time . Do you want her reading your dirty palindromes , or whatever it is you want to text me ? ”
89694	89704	89691	89691	He	1114	“ Dirty palindromes . I could work with that . ”
89740	89757	89727	89727	He	1114	“ Becca , the caterers are pulling up outside . Hold the door open for us ? ”

90273	90306	90248	90249	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Fine , I guess . Ca n’t imagine what it feels like watching many millions of your dollars on the line as you try to make it into the final round . ”
90307	90318	90319	90320	my intern	1552	“ I ’ll bet it ’s not about the money , ”
90323	90330	90319	90320	my intern	1552	“ He just wants to win . ”
90331	90334	90248	90249	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Hmm . ”

91085	91094	91095	91095	he	1114	“ I ’m just doin’ you a favor , ”
91098	91119	91095	91095	he	1114	“ Do n’t you have to spin around a lot at those therapy sessions you ’re going into debt for ? ”
91458	91471	91450	91450	I	113	“ You boys need anything ? I ’m going for a refill . ”
91472	91479	91480	91480	Castro	1011	“ Nope , I ’m good , ”
92210	92213	92202	92202	Nate	1114	“ Hello ? ”
92214	92217	92202	92202	Nate	1114	“ Hi . ”
92239	92251	92231	92231	I	113	“ Hi yourself . Now tell me what ’s the problem ? ”
92252	92276	92223	92223	Rebecca	1114	“ Nothing is wrong . It ’s just … I have my period . Sex is off the table , that ’s all . ”
92277	92280	92231	92231	I	113	“ Oh . ”
92287	92304	92223	92223	Rebecca	1114	“ Thank you for being dense once in a while . It makes you more normal . ”
92305	92311	92312	92312	I	113	“ Normal is really overrated , ”
92315	92336	92312	92312	I	113	“ I suppose . Congratulations , Nate . I know you ’re pumped up about this chance to smash Dallas . ”
92337	92354	92355	92355	I	113	“ Thanks . But you know I always feel like a heel when people congratulate me . ”
92370	92373	92223	92223	Rebecca	1114	“ Why ? ”
92374	92400	92223	92223	Rebecca	1114	“ I did n’t score any of those goals tonight . And I ’m not the coach . I ’m just the wallet behind it . ”
92408	92458	92401	92401	Becca	1114	“ I know what you mean . But you built the team that made it happen . You and Hugh . And you did it for Brooklyn . The bars must be pretty packed tonight . The bartenders probably appreciate it most , now that I think about it . ”
92459	92462	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Hmm . ”
92499	92502	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Nate ? ”
92503	92508	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Yes , Bec ? ”
92509	92522	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Did it piss you off when I was talking to Castro ? ”
92525	92563	92470	92470	she	1937	“ You never piss me off . I do n’t like to see his hands on you , though . If that makes me a caveman , I ’m sorry . He has a thing for you . ”
92564	92570	92470	92470	she	1937	“ We ’re just friends . ”
92571	92585	92470	92470	she	1937	“ I know . But he ’d take that shot if he could . ”
92586	92592	92470	92470	she	1937	“ He propositioned me once . ”
92599	92602	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Really ? ”
92603	92627	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Yeah . Just once . I told him I could never date a player , and that was the end of it . ”
92628	92633	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Were you tempted ? ”
92645	92654	92470	92470	she	1937	“ Never mind . I retract the question . ”
92655	92659	92660	92660	she	1939	“ Not much , ”
92664	92725	92660	92660	she	1939	“ I mean — Castro is a cutie , and he ’s genuinely nice . But it just was n’t worth exploring . I can either be the office manager that players listen to , or the office manager that seems like she ’s only there to ogle the players . Women do n’t get the benefit of the doubt . ”
92742	92745	92737	92737	I	113	“ Bec ? ”
92746	92749	92660	92660	she	1939	“ Yeah ? ”
92750	92776	92737	92737	I	113	“ It ’s funny how I really could n’t understand until just this minute . When you used Castro as an example instead of me . ”
92777	92780	92660	92660	she	1939	“ Ah . ”
92794	92807	92660	92660	she	1939	“ I get it now . I understand why you ’re reluctant . ”
92808	92824	92737	92737	I	113	“ It ’s worse , you know . Doing the boss . The optics stink . ”
92825	92833	92834	92834	Becca	1114	“ Except the team already trusts you . ”
92845	92884	92737	92737	I	113	“ Sure , but we have new people all the time . To them I ’m gossip at best or a spy . ‘ Watch what you say to her , she ’s sleeping with the owner . ’ ”
92891	92901	92885	92885	I	113	“ But you ’re doing it anyway . Why ? ”
92902	92906	92907	92907	she	1941	“ No idea , ”
92911	92918	92907	92907	she	1941	“ Maybe because you ’re irresistible . ”
92919	92924	92925	92925	I	113	“ You flatter me , ”
93106	93112	93113	93113	she	1941	“ Did your phone die ? ”
93119	93122	93123	93123	I	113	“ Yes . ”
93128	93138	93123	93123	I	113	“ But I was n’t done talking to you . ”
93139	93148	93149	93149	She	1941	“ You ’re going to ruin my reputation . ”
93163	93201	93202	93202	I	113	“ First of all , I ’ll leave at hung - over - o’clock . No player is getting up before seven . Secondly , I have a ready excuse if someone sees me leaving your room . ”
93219	93224	93263	93263	She	1941	“ What ’s that ? ”
93225	93230	93263	93263	She	1941	“ What ’s what ? ”
93231	93246	93263	93263	She	1941	“ This terrific excuse for why you ’re leaving my room in the morning . ”
93247	93262	93263	93263	She	1941	“ I just had to see the playoffs budget in sweatpants with sex hair . ”
93273	93283	93263	93263	She	1941	“ You wo n’t have sex hair , remember ? ”
93291	93304	93284	93284	I	113	“ Snuggle hair . Bedhead . Whatever . Get under the covers . ”
93354	93361	93350	93350	I	113	“ You have the best underwear . ”
93384	93401	93366	93366	she	1941	“ Cotton panties during shark week , though . You left your palatial suite for nothing . ”
93402	93408	93409	93409	I	113	“ That is not true . ”
93432	93440	93420	93420	I	113	“ I ’m on the wrong side . ”
93441	93447	93412	93413	the comforter	1177	“ You have a side ? ”
93448	93457	93458	93458	I	113	“ Left - handed guy on the left . ”
93493	93497	93477	93477	I	113	“ Come here . ”
93521	93526	93527	93527	I	113	“ That ’s better , ”
93530	93538	93527	93527	I	113	“ This is what I came for . ”
93539	93542	93543	93543	Rebecca	1114	“ Okay . ”
93549	93557	93558	93558	I	113	“ You do n’t trust me yet , ”
93569	93574	93562	93562	I	113	“ But you will . ”
93575	93580	93581	93581	she	1941	“ I trust you , ”
93584	93601	93602	93602	She	1941	“ You trust me not to be a dick . You trust me with my dick . ”
93605	93616	93602	93602	She	1941	“ But you do n’t think you could love me . ”
93624	93636	93617	93617	She	1941	“ I did n’t say that . I never said that . ”
93670	93684	93689	93689	she	1941	“ Maybe you think I could n’t love you . Is that it ? ”
93685	93688	93689	93689	she	1941	“ Maybe , ”
93692	93695	93689	93689	she	1941	“ Why ? ”
93696	93703	93704	93704	She	1941	“ Because we are so different . ”
93715	93748	93689	93689	she	1941	“ I do n’t like shopping at Bloomingdale ’s . But otherwise we like a lot of the same things . Alien movies . Street food . Let ’s not forget hockey . ”
93749	93752	93753	93753	she	1941	“ Nate , ”
93757	93786	93753	93753	she	1941	“ Do n’t be dense . You ’re a genius and an Ivy League grad . And the head of a Fortune 500 company . I ’m not . ”
93787	93809	93810	93810	She	1941	“ There is nothing stupid about you , though . Not one thing . And leaving school was n’t your fault . ”
93827	93927	93810	93810	She	1941	“ Look , Bec . I do n’t have a PowerPoint to explain why I need you . I just do . I have for a while now , but apparently I ’m not the sharpest scalpel on the tray after all , because it took me too long to say so . But here I am in your bed . I came downstairs because I like your smile and I wanted to see it before I went to sleep . And I ’d like to do that as often as I can , if you ’ll let me … ”
94056	94061	94062	94062	she	1949	“ You scare me , ”
94068	94078	94062	94062	she	1949	“ And I ’m not used to being scared . ”
94099	94123	94081	94081	I	113	“ I ’m not scary . I ’m not even very complicated . But I can be patient until you figure that out . ”
94153	94162	94146	94146	She	1949	“ Now I got you all worked up . ”
94182	94192	94146	94146	She	1949	“ What are we going to do about that ? ”
94193	94198	94199	94199	I	113	“ Not a thing . ”
94205	94228	94199	94199	I	113	“ I ’m used to being worked up over you . I was for years . Thought it was a permanent condition . ”
94229	94234	94235	94235	she	1949	“ Oh , Nate , ”
94238	94246	94235	94235	she	1949	“ That ca n’t really be true . ”
94247	94252	94253	94253	I	113	“ Sure it is . ”
94272	94330	94261	94261	I	113	“ I mean , I did n’t allow myself to lie around fantasizing about you . But whenever we were in the same room I ’d get distracted . These days ? I ’m all about the fantasies . In my dreams we ’ve had sex in every civilized country . And much of the developing world . ”
94334	94343	94331	94331	Rebecca	1114	“ Really ? What ’s your favorite fantasy ? ”
94344	94347	94348	94348	I	113	“ Mmm . ”
94378	94440	94348	94348	I	113	“ We ’re on a private beach somewhere , playing in the water . And we start fooling around . And then we just ca n’t wait . I have to carry you out of the waves , shove down your tiny bikini , put you on your hands and knees and just fuck you right there on the wet sand . ”
94441	94447	94448	94448	She	1949	“ That does sound nice . ”
94465	94486	94448	94448	She	1949	“ Is there really such thing as a truly private beach ? Or is this an exhibition fantasy , too ? ”
94487	94491	94492	94492	I	113	“ No way . ”
94510	94516	94492	94492	I	113	“ It ’s private because … ”
94531	94584	94585	94585	I	113	“ … That ’s what you do for me . My life is constant noise . Meetings and obligations and two thousand employees . It ’s great , but it ’s loud . When you kiss me , everything goes quiet . That ’s the only time I can forget everyone else . ”
94599	94619	94585	94585	I	113	“ And when I ’m inside you , we ’re all that matters . I crave it so much . ”
94634	94639	94640	94640	she	1949	“ I love that , ”
94643	94655	94640	94640	she	1949	“ I did n’t know I could do that for you . ”
94697	94700	94701	94701	I	113	“ Bec , ”
94714	94720	94704	94704	she	1949	“ What ’s your fantasy ? ”
94729	94769	94721	94721	Her	1949	“ It ’s simpler than yours . You just push me face down on the bed . I try to talk to you , but you do n’t listen . You just hold me down and go to town . ”
94770	94775	94809	94809	She	1949	“ That ’s not … ”
94790	94797	94784	94784	Becca	1114	“ … Very polite of me , ”
94804	94808	94809	94809	She	1949	“ I know . ”
94829	94844	94823	94823	I	113	“ But some fantasies make more sense in your head than in real life . ”
94921	94924	94925	94925	she	1949	“ Oh , ”
94931	94938	94939	94939	I	113	“ Can you come like this ? ”
94942	94948	94939	94939	I	113	“ I do n’t know . ”
94949	94955	94956	94956	We	1953	“ Let ’s find out . ”
94996	94999	95000	95000	Becca	1114	“ Jesus , ”
95299	95302	95303	95303	Stewart	143	“ Dude , ”
95314	95348	95303	95303	Stewart	143	“ You never take this long to make a decision . I could start a new router company and sell it off in the time it ’s taking you to figure this out . ”
95383	95394	95395	95395	I	113	“ There are over a hundred jobs on the line , ”
95399	95405	95395	95395	I	113	“ Real people with families . ”
95406	95417	95418	95418	Stew	143	“ That ’s an honorable reason to take your time . ”
95431	95463	95418	95418	Stew	143	“ But unless you ’ve taught Bingley to read the future , there ’s no way to know what the other company will ultimately do with it once it ’s theirs . ”
95477	95484	95464	95464	He	143	“ I ’m a control freak . ”
95485	95494	95464	95464	He	143	“ You ’re just figuring that out now ? ”
95495	95508	95464	95464	He	143	“ Do n’t you have some ledgers to go over or something ? ”
95523	95552	95509	95509	My	113	“ Wait , is this a safe place to sit ? Now that you ’re getting some action again , should I worry what happens on this couch ? ”
95591	95604	95553	95553	I	113	“ Dallas , huh ? Can I tag along to game one ? ”
95605	95611	95553	95553	I	113	“ Sure , why not . ”
95612	95646	95553	95553	I	113	“ I ’m surprised you ’re not off with the team somewhere , watching game tape . ‘ This is the guy you want to hit . Squash him like a bug . ’ ”
95647	95650	95553	95553	I	113	“ Stew … ”
95669	95697	95661	95661	Lauren	91	“ Nate — there ’s a doctor on your line . Armitage . Does that sound familiar ? He says you ’ll know what it ’s about . ”
95698	95707	95708	95708	I	113	“ Ah . I ’ll pick him up . ”
95713	95738	95708	95708	I	113	“ Go . Get out of here . I have to let the doctor shake me down for another contribution for brain injury research . ”
95739	95745	95751	95751	Stew	143	“ Sounds stimulating . Later . ”
95758	95768	95753	95753	I	113	“ Hello , doctor ! How are things going ? ”
95769	95778	95779	95779	he	1972	“ I was hoping you could tell me , ”
95782	95828	95779	95779	he	1972	“ We have n’t seen Rebecca in nearly two weeks . Has her number changed ? I ’d like to get a hold of her to see if she can come back to therapy , and also have a follow - up visit for testing . ”
95829	95834	95835	95835	I	113	“ Back to therapy , ”
95839	95846	95835	95835	I	113	“ She has n’t been in ? ”
95852	95867	95932	95932	She	1973	“ Sorry . I assumed you knew that . I would n’t have asked … ”
95868	95875	95876	95876	I	113	“ No , it ’s fine , ”
95880	95889	95876	95876	I	113	“ She ’s traveling in Dallas right now . ”
95890	95902	95932	95932	She	1973	“ Right ! Congratulations , by the way . Big news . ”
95903	95910	95911	95911	I	113	“ The whole organization is thrilled , ”
95971	95979	95965	95965	I	113	“ What the hell are you thinking ? ”
96016	96020	96006	96006	I	113	“ do n’t yell ”
96218	96223	96224	96224	I	113	“ Hey , Bingley ? ”
96231	96243	96334	96334	he	113	“ Hullo , Nate ! What can I do you for ? ”
96244	96259	96350	96350	I	113	“ Bingley , have you been talking to Stew ? Is that his joke ? ”
96260	96268	96334	96334	he	113	“ Yessir . Do you like it ? ”
96269	96294	96350	96350	I	113	“ I happen to think it ’s funny , but it ’s inappropriate . ‘ Do you ’ is an idiomatic expression for sex . ”
96295	96307	96334	96334	he	113	“ Oh , dear . Thank you for letting me know . ”
96308	96319	96350	96350	I	113	“ Could you connect me with Dr. Armitage ’s office ? ”
96320	96326	96334	96334	he	113	“ Right away , sir . ”
96337	96349	96334	96334	he	113	“ The doctor ’s receptionist is on your line , sir . ”
96357	96366	96350	96350	I	113	“ Hi there . This is Nate Kattenberger … ”
96367	96374	96375	96375	she	1982	“ Your assistant is very polite , ”
96378	96384	96375	96375	she	1982	“ What a cute accent . ”
96385	96420	96350	96350	I	113	“ He ’s the greatest . Could you help me with something ? I have n’t gotten a bill yet for Ms. Rebecca Rowley ’s office visits . Maybe the insurer is processing them ? ”
96421	96430	96431	96431	I	113	“ Oh , Rebecca ! Let me see … ”
96436	96457	96431	96431	I	113	“ Those therapy sessions and the doctor visits are out of network . They were applied to a Visa card . ”
96463	96472	96458	96458	Rebecca	2523	“ What are the total charges to date ? ”
96473	96480	96458	96458	Rebecca	2523	“ Three thousand four hundred dollars . ”
96495	96517	96458	96458	Rebecca	2523	“ All right , then there ’s been some confusion . Could I possibly give you a different card , instead ? ”
96518	96524	96552	96553	Dallas Nate	571	“ Sure , Mr. Kattenberger . ”
96619	96625	96607	96608	Heidi Jo	1029	“ This is rully pretty , ”
96646	96666	96607	96608	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I know we ’re just here to win , but the travel team did us a solid here . ”
96707	96710	96711	96712	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Look ! ”
96723	96730	96711	96712	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Luxury suite , penthouse level . ”
96731	96738	96739	96739	I	113	“ That must be a mistake . ”
96769	96773	96774	96774	I	113	“ Excuse me , ”
96781	96791	96774	96774	I	113	“ I ’m supposed to have a regular room . ”
96792	96801	96802	96802	She	1991	“ No , that was by special request . ”
96815	96823	96774	96774	I	113	“ Is there a regular room available ? ”
96828	96843	96824	96824	Her	1991	“ I ’m sorry , but the playoffs have the whole hotel booked solid . ”
96852	96859	96860	96861	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Here you go , then ! ”
96957	96970	96971	96972	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Ooh ! They offer a margarita salt scrub in the spa ! ”
96975	96988	96971	96972	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Let ’s see if there are two massage appointments during lunch . ”
96989	96994	96995	96995	I	113	“ You go ahead , ”
97415	97432	97433	97433	He	571	“ Hey ! How ’s Dallas ? Did you make it up to the suite yet ? ”
97444	97515	97440	97440	I	113	“ Where to begin ? Okay , fine . The suite . I said no , and yet here I am anyway . That ’s strike one , especially because Heidi Jo spotted the room change first . So thanks for that . Let ’s just hope she ’s not a gossip . But are you fucking kidding me with the thirty - four hundred smackers on my credit card ? ”
97524	97552	97518	97518	him	571	“ You can go back to therapy now , Bec . This is me trying not to get upset that you are n’t following doctor ’s orders . ”
97553	97558	97440	97440	I	113	“ You ’re upset . ”
97562	97588	97559	97559	He	571	“ I plead the fifth on that . Ca n’t imagine why you would n’t take care of your brain , for fuck ’s sake . ”
97589	97595	97559	97559	He	571	“ I do take care ! ”
97596	97615	97559	97559	He	571	“ Not according to the good doctor , who only called me because he was worried about you . ”
97616	97676	97559	97559	He	571	“ Now you listen here . There are therapeutic exercises that do n’t cost almost three hundo a session ! I ’ve got Pilates at twenty - five bucks a class , and the take - home exercises they gave me . I ’m not an idiot , but thanks for making it clear that you think I am . ”
97677	97688	97559	97559	He	571	“ I did n’t say that . Do n’t exaggerate . ”
97689	97698	97699	97699	I	113	“ Do n’t treat me like a child ! ”
97707	97763	97699	97699	I	113	“ If you had a concern , you could ’ve told me . If you wanted to help me afford the platinum - priced therapy , you could have asked . You say you care about me , but then you pull this bullshit . You care , as long as everything goes your way . ”
97764	97767	97559	97559	He	571	“ Rebecca … ”
97768	97809	97699	97699	I	113	“ Save it , okay ? I have a job to do here . We ’ve been over this . Your suite will be empty when you arrive in Dallas . Stay in your own lane until after the playoffs . ”
97898	97908	97909	97909	I	113	“ How about chocolates shaped like a taxi cab ? ”
97912	97923	97909	97909	I	113	“ I think we should run with the Brooklyn theme . ”
97924	97933	97934	97934	she	95	“ But the wedding is in Long Island , ”
97950	97956	97957	97957	I	113	“ Brooklyn brought you together ! ”
97960	97991	97957	97957	I	113	“ Fine , hockey can be the theme . Or hockey and tennis ! Both your sports . We could alternate . I thought those personalized chocolate bars were cute . ”
98022	98038	97999	97999	Georgia	95	“ Becca , stop it . Nobody cares about chocolate with my name on it . ”
98039	98050	97999	97999	Georgia	95	“ Fine . Little bottles of wine with your names … ”
98051	98054	98055	98055	She	95	“ Stop ! ”
98060	98091	98055	98055	She	95	“ I do n’t care about favors . You are awesome , which is why I have a dress and flowers and a caterer but we are done , okay ? ”
98092	98107	98055	98055	She	95	“ Deep breaths . It was only game one . We can rebuild it . ”
98184	98246	98168	98168	She	95	“ Look . I ’m going to sneak into Leo ’s room and see how he ’s doing . You are welcome to stay here . You are also welcome to tell me what the hell is going on with you . For twenty - four hours you ’ve been hounding me about wedding favors and I want to know why . ”
98247	98253	98293	98294	Oh boy	2015	“ Because the wedding is … ”
98270	98292	98254	98254	She	95	“ Bec , cut the crap . Something happened and you have n’t told me what . But I have theories . ”
98296	98300	98293	98294	Oh boy	2015	“ Like what ? ”
98301	98325	98293	98294	Oh boy	2015	“ Something went wrong with Nate . And it ’s probably not all his fault , or you would have told me already . ”
98339	98352	98330	98330	I	113	“ I ’m mad at him . But I ’m also confused . ”
98357	98362	98353	98353	Her	95	“ Tell me why . ”
98384	98400	98367	98367	I	113	“ I thought he listened . And then he just ignored what I ’d said . ”
98423	98435	98412	98412	Georgia	95	“ He puts Lauren in a suite sometimes when they travel . ”
98436	98442	98412	98412	Georgia	95	“ Not in his suite . ”
98443	98456	98457	98457	She	95	“ Why is Nate ’s name on a different room , then ? ”
98466	98469	98470	98470	I	113	“ What ? ”
98486	98489	98480	98481	Nathan Kattenberger	1114	“ But … ”
98495	98507	98480	98481	Nathan Kattenberger	1114	“ He asked me to stay in his suite with him . ”
98508	98514	98515	98515	Georgia	95	“ And you said no . ”
98529	98540	98515	98515	Georgia	95	“ So he switched them to give you the suite . ”
98541	98546	98547	98547	I	113	“ Oh , fuck , ”
98550	98554	98547	98547	I	113	“ I yelled . ”
98555	98592	98623	98623	Georgia	95	“ Everyone yells sometimes . And he really should have asked before paying your doctor ’s bills . Even if he did it because he loves you and cares what happens to your big stupid head . ”
98602	98622	98596	98596	I	113	“ It is ! Big and so stupid . But I do n’t think I can make it smarter . ”
98633	98687	98623	98623	Georgia	95	“ I think you ’re just stressed out . In your defense , nothing about these last two months has been normal . You were injured and scared . Work has been really stressful . Your sister and her boy toy have taken over your apartment . That ’s some big stuff happening . ”
98688	98714	98623	98623	Georgia	95	“ Nate confuses me . We ’re not equals and we can never be equals and so I freak out every time I feel cornered . ”
98715	98718	98719	98719	Georgia	95	“ Equals , ”
98723	98732	98719	98719	Georgia	95	“ I do n’t know if I agree . ”
98733	98743	98623	98623	Georgia	95	“ Oh , please . Do n’t flatter me . ”
98744	98758	98719	98719	Georgia	95	“ What makes me and Leo equals , though ? What makes anyone ? ”
98768	98777	98759	98759	I	113	“ Neither you nor Leo runs the world . ”
98778	98798	98799	98799	Georgia	95	“ Well , it ’s true that I could n’t buy and sell a small country before breakfast tomorrow , ”
98802	98841	98799	98799	Georgia	95	“ But maybe that does n’t matter in Nate ’s head at all . Maybe he ’s just a guy , standing in front of a girl , asking her to climb into a Jacuzzi tub with him . ”
98842	98845	98846	98846	I	113	“ Maybe , ”
98852	98873	98799	98799	Georgia	95	“ It ’s not like you to be intimidated by Nate . When you met him , were you intimidated ? ”
98874	98877	98878	98878	I	113	“ No , ”
98881	98886	98799	98799	Georgia	95	“ Then why now ? ”
98905	98933	98895	98895	I	113	“ Maybe it ’s not Nate that ’s intimidating me . Maybe it ’s taking a risk on a man . I do n’t usually do that . ”
98941	98956	98934	98934	Georgia	95	“ The truth is revealed ! You are getting smarter . Look at that . ”
98957	98970	99030	99030	she	1177	“ Shut up or I ’ll choose tacky wedding favors for you . ”
98971	98977	98978	98978	She	1177	“ Like I ’d notice . ”
98983	99005	98978	98978	She	1177	“ Bye for now . I ’m going to strip Leo naked and see if I ca n’t cheer him up . ”
99006	99011	99012	99012	I	113	“ I love you ! ”
99021	99028	98978	98978	She	1177	“ Back at you , babe . ”
99837	99840	99841	99841	I	113	“ Bingley ? ”
99867	99873	99841	99841	I	113	“ Yes , Miss Rowley ? ”
99874	99879	99880	99880	I	113	“ Call me Becca . ”
99886	99891	99841	99841	I	113	“ Yes , Becca ? ”
99892	99909	99841	99841	I	113	“ I just left a long voicemail for Nate . Could you erase it , please ? ”
99910	99942	99841	99841	I	113	“ I ’m sorry , but that is not within my powers . Voicemail resides with the cell phone carrier . KTech phones employ the carrier ’s software for this function . ”
99943	99953	99954	99954	I	113	“ Well , that is a bug , sir , ”
99957	99970	99954	99954	I	113	“ I ca n’t believe Nate did n’t write that software himself . ”
99971	99980	99841	99841	I	113	“ I will tell him you ’re displeased . ”
99981	99984	99985	99985	I	113	“ No ! ”
99994	100011	99985	99985	I	113	“ Do n’t do that . Do n’t ever tell Nate I ’m displeased about anything . ”
100012	100027	99841	99841	I	113	“ All right , miss . One word from you shall silence me forever . ”
100028	100035	100036	100036	I	113	“ That ’s a little dramatic . ”
100039	100045	100036	100036	I	113	“ Good night , Bingley . ”
100046	100052	99841	99841	I	113	“ Pleasant dreams , miss . ”
100097	100104	100092	100092	I	113	“ take a damned deep breath . ”
100274	100278	100279	100279	Beringer	318	“ Man on ! ”
100284	100289	100279	100279	Beringer	318	“ Trevi ’s open ! ”
100302	100313	100297	100297	Castro	1011	“ Come on , boys , you can do this ! ”
100485	100489	100490	100490	he	318	“ Thank fuck , ”
100497	100518	100490	100490	he	318	“ That took a year off my life , Bec . Come to the bar with us for a celly ? ”
100519	100522	100523	100523	I	113	“ Okay , ”
100557	100563	100544	100544	I	113	“ The Tavern on Hicks ? ”
100564	100567	100568	100568	He	318	“ Naturally . ”
100572	100586	100568	100568	He	318	“ I ’ll go early and ask Pete to reserve the back room . ”
100587	100602	100626	100626	Beringer	318	“ Good plan . I ’m going to find my intern and invite her . ”
100741	100747	100748	100748	Georgia	95	“ Press room , people ! ”
100751	100758	100748	100748	Georgia	95	“ This way . Three minutes ! ”
100771	100776	100777	100778	Heidi Jo	1029	“ There you are ! ”
100794	100801	100777	100778	Heidi Jo	1029	“ That ’s enough screen time . ”
100802	100814	100815	100815	She	1029	“ Hey ! It ’s you who ’s been texting me ! ”
100818	100824	100815	100815	She	1029	“ Could n’t be helped ! ”
100825	100829	100833	100833	I	113	“ That is … ”
100839	100858	100833	100833	I	113	“ The players are drinking at The Tavern on Hicks tonight . I came downstairs to invite you . ”
100859	100862	100863	100863	Her	1029	“ Oh ! ”
100868	100882	100863	100863	Her	1029	“ I ’m in . Do they have darts and a pool table ? ”
100883	100886	100887	100887	I	113	“ Sure ? ”
100893	100901	100902	100902	she	1029	“ I ’m kind of a shark , ”
100908	100916	100917	100918	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Ca n’t say I ’m surprised . ”
100987	101003	101004	101004	Georgia	95	“ Thank you for being with us tonight as we make our way toward victory , ”
101010	101040	101004	101004	Georgia	95	“ The club owner , Mr. Nathan Kattenberger , would like to thank you as well . Please hold your questions until after coach ’s remarks . Thank you . ”
101138	101142	101143	101145	a female journalist	1489	“ Mr. Kattenberger ! ”
101165	101180	101152	101152	Georgia	95	“ Is it true that you have a personal grudge against the Dallas team ? ”
101226	101231	101232	101232	He	1114	“ Personal ? No . ”
101242	101258	101232	101232	He	1114	“ Though I hold a grudge against anyone standing between my team and the Cup . ”
101263	101272	101259	101259	Georgia	95	“ We ’ll take questions at the end … ”
101280	101299	101274	101275	the reporter	2075	“ Did you buy a hockey team to get revenge on the Dallas player who stole your fiancée ? ”
101304	101309	101310	101310	Nate	1114	“ That ’s ridiculous , ”
101320	101348	101310	101310	Nate	1114	“ I ’ve been a hockey fan since I could talk . I bought a hockey team so I could bring major league sports back to Brooklyn … ”
101363	101376	101349	101350	This woman	1489	“ Did n’t you walk in on Dallas captain Bart Palacio and — ”
101377	101381	101382	101382	Georgia	95	“ Excuse me , ”
101394	101406	101382	101382	Georgia	95	“ You will hold your questions until after coach ’s comments ! ”
101453	101463	101464	101464	she	1489	“ Coach Worthington has some comments about the game , ”
101506	101509	101510	101510	I	113	“ Phone ! ”
101536	101546	101522	101522	I	113	“ I need my phone ! Whip it out . ”
101570	101572	101566	101566	Nate	1114	“ Dallas ”
101646	101652	101653	101654	my intern	1552	“ Here , let me , ”
101657	101666	101667	101667	she	1029	“ What are we looking at ? Oh , ”
101671	101674	101667	101667	she	1029	“ Yuck . ”
101675	101679	101680	101680	I	113	“ Read it , ”
101683	101687	101688	101688	She	1029	“ This headline . ”
101697	101711	101688	101688	She	1029	“ Scandal : Owner Nate Kattenberger ’s Secret Beef with Dallas Hockey Star . ”
101712	101715	101667	101667	she	1029	“ Fuck ! ”
101727	101734	101667	101667	she	1029	“ Nate ’s not like that ! ”
101735	101738	101739	101740	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Shh ! ”
101743	101764	101739	101740	Heidi Jo	1029	“ If you want to keep your thing with Nate secret you ’re going to have to lower your voice . ”
101783	101787	101773	101773	Nate	1114	“ Keep reading . ”
101788	101831	101768	101768	she	1029	“ Five years ago the billionaire owner of the Brooklyn Bruisers caught his fiancée in their bed with a professional hockey player . This week Nate has a shot at revenge as his team takes on Dallas in the Stanley Cup finals . ”
101832	101836	101837	101837	I	113	“ Holy shit , ”
101886	101891	101892	101892	I	113	“ Holy . Shit , ”
101920	101930	101931	101932	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I did n’t know Nate was once engaged ! ”
101935	101940	101931	101932	Heidi Jo	1029	“ She ’s pretty . ”
101941	101945	101946	101946	I	113	“ She is , ”
101949	101961	101946	101946	I	113	“ They were together from college . I never liked her . ”
101973	101986	101969	101970	Heidi Jo	1029	“ I would n’t either . She broke your man ’s heart ! ”
101987	101990	101991	101992	Poor Nate	1114	“ Shhh ! ”
102073	102077	102078	102079	Heidi Jo	1029	“ Cute kid , ”
102082	102095	102078	102079	Heidi Jo	1029	“ You did n’t know his ex was married to the captain ? ”
102096	102107	102108	102108	I	113	“ I did n’t know she was married at all , ”
102111	102118	102108	102108	I	113	“ Never looked her up before . ”
102203	102210	102211	102211	I	113	“ Let ’s go , Bec . ”
102225	102240	102211	102211	I	113	“ Beringer has a table at The Tavern . You ’re coming , right ? ”
102281	102289	102271	102271	Silas	260	“ Uber , cab , or walk ? ”
102290	102293	102294	102294	I	113	“ Walk , ”
102314	102318	102319	102319	Silas	260	“ Sounds good , ”
102330	102338	102339	102339	Castro	1011	“ That sure sucked for the bossman , ”
102347	102365	102339	102339	Castro	1011	“ Would n’t want the whole world knowing my ex dumped me for a meathead like Palacio . ”
102366	102374	102375	102376	Heidi Jo	1029	“ People say he ’s a dick , ”
102380	102388	102389	102389	Silas	260	“ Bec , did you know her ? ”
102405	102448	102392	102392	We	2094	“ A little . Spoke to her on the phone a couple times a day . Saw her once or twice a week . But just small talk , you know ? Shocked the hell out of me when they broke up . ”
102449	102459	102460	102460	Castro	1011	“ You ’re a pretty good judge of character , ”
102463	102468	102460	102460	Castro	1011	“ You liked her ? ”
102469	102472	102473	102473	I	113	“ Nope , ”
102477	102486	102473	102473	I	113	“ But I ca n’t even say why . ”
102500	102509	102510	102510	Castro	1011	“ Nate ’s prolly hitting the whiskey tonight , ”
102513	102544	102510	102510	Castro	1011	“ Bet he wo n’t turn up at the bar , though . Not after that bullshit . Everyone knows how much he hates Dallas ; now we know why . ”
102549	102555	102556	102556	I	113	“ Because Dallas is smug , ”
102559	102611	102556	102556	I	113	“ If Nate wanted revenge on a guy , you really think buying a team is an efficient strategy ? He ’d probably just make the guy ’s phone run at a quarter the normal speed , or write a script that gave him zits in every photo on the internet . ”
102641	102662	102633	102633	Nate	1114	“ You know , I think I ’m too wiped for The Tavern . I ’ll see you guys later ? ”
102663	102671	102672	102672	Castro	1011	“ Want us to walk you home ? ”
102679	102686	102687	102687	I	113	“ Nope , I ’m good ! ”
102707	102712	102713	102713	She	1029	“ Get some rest . ”
102755	102761	102762	102762	Bingley	143	“ Hullo , Master Nate , ”
102765	102772	102762	102762	Bingley	143	“ Would you like the television ? ”
102773	102778	102762	102762	Bingley	143	“ God , no . ”
102791	102800	102762	102762	Bingley	143	“ Pour me a Scotch , would you ? ”
102801	102822	102762	102762	Bingley	143	“ Sorry , sir . I have not the talent which some people possess . That is beyond my capabilities . ”
102823	102836	102762	102762	Bingley	143	“ I know , Bingley . Just wondered what you ’d say . ”
103171	103178	103179	103179	she	716	“ I could have prevented that , ”
103182	103191	103179	103179	she	716	“ You need to let me protect you . ”
103192	103196	103197	103197	I	113	“ Lesson learned , ”
103265	103268	103269	103269	Bingley	143	“ Sir , ”
103273	103286	103269	103269	Bingley	143	“ Rebecca would like to know if she can call on you . ”
103319	103332	103287	103287	I	113	“ Would you tell her that now is not a good time ? ”
103333	103337	103338	103338	Bingley	143	“ All right , ”
103341	103348	103338	103338	Bingley	143	“ I ’ll send her home . ”
103349	103352	103353	103353	I	113	“ Wait . ”
103359	103364	103353	103353	I	113	“ She ’s here ? ”
103365	103373	103338	103338	Bingley	143	“ On the front steps , sir . ”
103374	103381	103382	103382	I	113	“ Fine , send her up , ”
103479	103485	103463	103463	she	2118	“ So . Cat tacos ? ”
103494	103497	103498	103498	I	113	“ Wait . ”
103502	103511	103498	103498	I	113	“ Did you bring me empanadas and tequila ? ”
103512	103515	103516	103516	she	2118	“ Yeah , ”
103520	103529	103516	103516	she	2118	“ It ’s nothing , really , but … ”
103534	103542	103530	103530	I	113	“ Do you know I love you ? ”
103553	103560	103543	103543	Her	2118	“ No . I did n’t . ”
103561	103595	103530	103530	I	113	“ It ’s true , Bec . I ’ve got it bad . And that shitty little story about Juliet and me is a bummer , but it ’s really no big deal . ”
103596	103602	103603	103603	she	2118	“ I did n’t know , ”
103610	103616	103603	103603	she	2118	“ About Juliet and Dallas . ”
103619	103622	103623	103623	I	113	“ Really ? ”
103638	103683	103633	103633	She	2118	“ Did n’t have a clue . But I realized something important on the way over here . You asked me to sit with you in Dallas . And I said no because people would see us together and know we ’re a thing . ”
103684	103693	103694	103694	She	2118	“ Right . I get it , Bec . ”
103699	103723	103694	103694	She	2118	“ But I did n’t get it . You knew they ’d see how it was . And you still wanted me there . ”
103724	103728	103729	103729	I	113	“ Of course . ”
103739	103759	103774	103774	she	2118	“ You did n’t care that people would say , ‘ Oh , Nate is dating his secretary . ’ ”
103760	103764	103765	103765	I	113	“ Office manager , ”
103805	103823	103797	103797	she	2118	“ Glasses ? Or are we going in straight from the bottle , just like old times ? ”
103885	103890	103891	103891	she	2120	“ I ’m sorry , ”
103898	103935	103936	103936	She	2120	“ You wanted me beside you and I said no . It ’s just that I did n’t really believe it . I thought you ’d want another Juliet or Alex . Someone who ’s more … ”
103939	103944	103936	103936	She	2120	“ More than me . ”
103945	103975	103976	103976	I	113	“ There is nobody more than you . Nobody funnier . Nobody with a better attitude . Nobody more loyal . Nobody sexier . That ’s for damn sure . ”
104001	104004	103989	103989	She	2120	“ What ? ”
104005	104012	104013	104013	she	2120	“ I love you , too , ”
104057	104080	104037	104037	she	2120	“ I ’m about to get insta - drunk , so please note that I said that while I was still sober . ”
104091	104096	104087	104087	I	113	“ Insta - drunk ? ”
104097	104113	104131	104131	Becca	2523	“ Yup . I ’m allowed to drink again . But my tolerance is gone . ”
104114	104130	104087	104087	I	113	“ Then get over here and kiss me before the tequila hits your motor skills . ”
104172	104177	104178	104178	she	2523	“ I ’m sorry , ”
104183	104200	104178	104178	she	2523	“ I ’m sorry I yelled . Sorry I got all crazy about the medical bills . ”
104280	104283	104284	104284	I	113	“ Mmm , ”
104346	104350	104351	104351	I	113	“ Unzip me , ”
104430	104435	104436	104436	I	113	“ Fuck , yeah . ”
104476	104481	104482	104482	I	113	“ Lose the panties , ”
104504	104510	104511	104511	I	113	“ That ’s my girl , ”
104596	104599	104600	104600	she	2523	“ Oh , ”
104603	104606	104600	104600	she	2523	“ Yesssss . ”
104650	104656	104657	104657	I	113	“ You are fucking perfect , ”
104668	104679	104657	104657	I	113	“ And so sexy I want to lose my mind . ”
104680	104686	104687	104687	she	2523	“ Lose it , then , ”
104723	104731	104732	104732	Becca	2523	“ So . Have you seen her ? ”
104767	104770	104771	104771	I	113	“ Who ? ”
104786	104795	104771	104771	I	113	“ You ’re joking , right ? Juliet . ”
104818	104839	104805	104805	Becca	2523	“ No . I have n’t . But why would I , right ? The teams do n’t really mingle . ”
104840	104844	104771	104771	I	113	“ Thank God . ”
104848	104887	104845	104845	I	113	“ Still have to look at Bart ’s ugly ass during every game . With three goals he ’s the high - scorer so far for this series . I want to run him down with the Zamboni . ”
104888	104898	104899	104899	She	2523	“ Do you think he ’s still a vegan ? ”
104906	104914	104915	104915	I	113	“ How do you even remember that ? ”
104932	104977	104899	104899	She	2523	“ We were snarking about the fact that he was a shitty dinner date . I remember everything about that night , including rolling you into a taxi after we got drunk . I had the spins on the subway on the way home . ”
104978	104986	104989	104989	I	113	“ Seems like a hundred years ago . ”
105007	105029	104999	104999	Becca	2523	“ Would it be too optimistic of me to ask if you ’d consider joining me for game five in Dallas ? ”
105040	105094	105034	105034	She	2523	“ I would be delighted to be your date for game five . Except I wo n’t be there . Earlier tonight I told Heidi Jo that she was going to Dallas in my place , because I finally went back to therapy and Dr. Armitage wants to see me on Monday morning . ”
105112	105126	105127	105127	I	113	“ It does n’t matter if you ’re not on the team jet , ”
105130	105169	105127	105127	I	113	“ I ’m flying out on the Gulfstream Monday afternoon . You ’d come with me . And not to work . This would be a date . If you ’re ready for that . But no pressure . ”
105181	105190	105175	105175	She	2523	“ Well , okay . It ’s on . ”
105191	105198	105199	105199	I	113	“ You can think about it , ”
105203	105214	105199	105199	I	113	“ If you ’re not ready , I ’ll understand . ”
105215	105221	105222	105222	she	2523	“ I want to go , ”
105226	105235	105222	105222	she	2523	“ I ’m all in if you are . ”
105784	105794	105795	105795	she	91	“ We can finish these reports during the flight , ”
105808	105815	105816	105816	I	113	“ You go nuts , girl , ”
106029	106048	106049	106049	She	1029	“ Can I get you anything else ? There are magazines and books in the seatpocket over here … ”
106057	106067	106049	106049	She	1029	“ And dinner will be served in an hour . ”
106084	106091	106092	106092	I	113	“ I ’m good for now , ”
106096	106100	106092	106092	I	113	“ Thank you . ”
106287	106290	106291	106291	Nate	1114	“ Rebecca ! ”
106302	106309	106291	106291	Nate	1114	“ How lovely to see you ! ”
106324	106336	106310	106310	I	113	“ Hello , Linda ! Are you ready for game five ? ”
106423	106428	106429	106429	she	167	“ I am ready , ”
106432	106449	106429	106429	she	167	“ Let ’s do this . Sit down ; I ’ll get us both a beer . ”
106537	106540	106541	106541	I	113	“ SLASHING ! ”
106548	106559	106541	106541	I	113	“ That ’s a two - minute minor at least ! ”
106740	106743	106744	106744	I	113	“ YAY ! ”
106747	106754	106744	106744	I	113	“ Thank you , baby Jesus ! ”
106807	106819	106820	106820	she	167	“ Goodbye , sweetie . Hope to see you again soon , ”
106859	106865	106866	106866	I	113	“ Can we walk back ? ”
106875	106878	106879	106879	Nate	1114	“ Sure , ”
106922	106927	106928	106928	I	113	“ About this party . ”
106953	106972	106973	106973	Nate	1114	“ I wo n’t stick my tongue down your throat , if that ’s what you ’re wondering . ”
106978	106990	106973	106973	Nate	1114	“ I know you ’d rather ease everyone into the idea . ”
106991	107017	107018	107018	Nate	1114	“ Right ! Exactly . I do n’t want it to be scandalous . Except later . Privately . When you see my new underwear . ”
107025	107029	107018	107018	Nate	1114	“ New underwear ? ”
107030	107065	107018	107018	Nate	1114	“ You bet . And we won tonight , so I ’m going to launder it carefully and wear it again for games six and seven . It ’s my lucky underwear . Obviously . ”
107066	107069	107070	107070	Nate	1114	“ Obviously . ”
107089	107114	107076	107076	He	1114	“ I ’m going to make it your getting lucky underwear as soon as I can . Maybe we can sneak past the party . ”
107201	107215	107194	107194	He	1114	“ That will have to hold me for an hour , I guess . ”
107262	107265	107266	107266	Castro	1011	“ Hey ! ”
107284	107290	107266	107266	Castro	1011	“ Look who ’s here . ”
107319	107326	107327	107327	he	1114	“ Good work tonight , boys ! ”
107380	107387	107388	107388	O’Doul	125	“ This man needs a beer , ”
107396	107399	107400	107400	Nate	1114	“ Two , ”
107421	107430	107431	107431	he	1114	“ I ’ll buy a round , guys , ”
107437	107447	107431	107431	he	1114	“ And there ’s something I want to say . ”
107448	107451	107452	107453	Leo Trevi	127	“ Speech ! ”
107466	107521	107456	107456	Nate	1114	“ First of all , I want to thank you for participating in my top - secret , multi - year conspiracy to exact revenge on a Dallas hockey player . Those of you who were in on it will get your bonus checks just as soon as you win the Cup on Saturday . ”
107546	107617	107534	107534	Nate	1114	“ In all seriousness , it ’s never fun to have your personal life hashed out in the press . But people have talked a lot of smack about our team from the beginning . We ’re too young . We ’re too uppity . Repositioning the franchise will be a disaster . You ’ve done an impressive job of ignoring that noise , and focusing on what really counts . ”
107653	107665	107666	107666	Nate	1114	“ That article in the post was totally wrong , anyway , ”
107699	107767	107768	107768	My	113	“ I bought a hockey team because I wanted to watch you guys kill it out there tonight . And — contrary to the news reports — I would like to personally thank Bart and Juliet Palacio for their intervention in my personal life . Because if they had n’t found each other , then I would n’t have this fine woman right here in my life . ”
107812	107817	107810	107810	Castro	1011	“ what the fuck ? ”
107837	107842	107826	107826	I	113	“ Oh , finally . ”
107929	107938	107939	107939	I	113	“ What happened to easing them into it ? ”
107942	107954	107939	107939	I	113	“ I ’m buying drinks . Duh . That eases everything . ”
107981	107984	107974	107974	he	127	“ Kiss ! ”
107985	107990	107991	107991	I	113	“ Oh , Christ , ”
108040	108063	108025	108025	I	113	“ That ’s it . That ’s the whole show . Ask again and your luggage goes missing on the flight home . ”
108064	108067	108068	108068	he	127	“ Fuck , ”
108227	108246	108215	108215	Stew	143	“ If you made up your fucking mind already , you would n’t have this problem , bigshot . ”
108275	108338	108265	108265	I	113	“ Hey you . Look . I want to do this transaction with you , but we have to move fast . And you have to show your face , because there ’s a new complication . For the love of God , call me back so I do n’t have to put your picture on the back of a milk carton . ”
108450	108460	108461	108461	Becca	2523	“ Come in , especially if you ’re Rebecca . ”
108476	108479	108461	108461	Becca	2523	“ Sorry , ”
108505	108508	108509	108509	I	113	“ Hey ! ”
108520	108529	108509	108509	I	113	“ Finally ! How goes it with you ? ”
108568	108579	108551	108551	She	130	“ Nate , I ’m here to ruin your day . ”
108580	108583	108584	108584	Women	613	“ What ? ”
108602	108625	108640	108640	she	130	“ Well . At least take off your jacket first . Or — should we step out for a cup of coffee ? ”
108677	108684	108685	108685	I	113	“ Spit it out , pal , ”
108688	108693	108685	108685	I	113	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
108694	108707	108664	108664	she	130	“ I ’m pregnant . But it ’s probably not your baby . ”
108788	108791	108792	108792	I	113	“ Pregnant , ”
108841	108844	108845	108845	I	113	“ Congratulations , ”
108863	108896	108897	108897	She	130	“ I know you well enough to hear your gears turning over there . I’m … 88 % sure this is n’t your problem . I was briefly dating Jonah after we … ”
108902	108923	108897	108897	She	130	“ But I need to ask you a favor . I need to rule you out before I approach him . ”
108924	108929	108930	108930	I	113	“ Rule me out , ”
108944	108952	108934	108934	She	130	“ With a paternity test , Nate . ”
108953	108958	108959	108959	I	113	“ Oh . Okay , ”
108963	108968	108959	108959	I	113	“ Whatever you need . ”
108969	108987	108934	108934	She	130	“ Breathe , Nate . This is n’t on you . But I need your help anyway . ”
108998	109003	109004	109004	I	113	“ I ’m good , ”
109007	109014	109004	109004	I	113	“ Tell me what to do . ”
109048	109063	109070	109070	she	130	“ I need you to take this , even though the chances are slim . ”
109079	109093	109070	109070	she	130	“ You need to ask me , because you ca n’t ask him ? ”
109102	109127	109094	109094	Her	130	“ I do n’t want to discuss it with him unless I ’m positive I have to . He ’s not a good man . ”
109128	109134	109223	109223	She	130	“ Oh shit , Alex . ”
109139	109209	109135	109135	Her	130	“ I know , okay ? I know . I ’ve made more mistakes this year than I can count . This is absolutely the last conversation I ever wanted to have with you . But even though I ’m pretty sure you ’re off the hook here , part of me wishes you were n’t . I ca n’t have a child with a man who hit me . ”
109216	109222	109210	109210	I	113	“ How bad was it ? ”
109228	109263	109223	109223	She	130	“ Believe me , the one time he did it was the last time we were in the same room together . He was just with me to try to get to my father . ”
109264	109268	109269	109269	I	113	“ Oh shit , ”
109292	109313	109359	109359	She	130	“ I called him on it and he backhanded me . That was the end of it . Until now . ”
109314	109317	109318	109318	I	113	“ So … ”
109327	109358	109318	109318	I	113	“ If the baby is his , you ’ll end up funding his startup anyway , in exchange for some legal document that says he ’s giving up parental rights . ”
109384	109389	109390	109390	I	113	“ I ’m sorry , ”
109403	109432	109390	109390	I	113	“ Let me get one thing straight , since I ’m not great at picking up social cues . Are you not here to discuss the router transaction ? ”
109444	109448	109433	109433	Her	130	“ You dick . ”
109473	109490	109463	109463	I	113	“ We ’ll get through this , buddy . It ’s all going to be okay . ”
109544	109547	109548	109548	Lauren	91	“ Hey ! ”
109561	109567	109548	109548	Lauren	91	“ You ’re looking snazzy . ”
109582	109586	109587	109587	I	113	“ Thank you , ”
109624	109644	109647	109647	she	91	“ Nate ’s chatting with Alex Engels for a minute . Do you want me to buzz him … ? ”
109716	109720	109721	109721	I	113	“ Um … ? ”
109725	109730	109721	109721	I	113	“ Was that weird ? ”
109731	109734	109735	109735	Lauren	91	“ Right ? ”
109738	109744	109735	109735	Lauren	91	“ Where ’s the fire ? ”
109754	109768	109746	109746	she	91	“ Go right in . He does n’t have another meeting for thirty . ”
109769	109772	109773	109773	I	113	“ Thanks . ”
109862	109865	109851	109851	I	113	“ Nate ? ”
109904	109907	109908	109908	I	113	“ Hi , ”
110199	110202	110203	110203	He	1114	“ Nate ? ”
110215	110220	110203	110203	He	1114	“ Are you okay ? ”
110221	110224	110225	110225	He	1114	“ No . ”
110249	110253	110254	110254	he	1114	“ Need you , ”
110261	110265	110266	110266	I	113	“ Have me , ”
110397	110400	110401	110401	he	1114	“ Yeah , ”
110464	110467	110468	110468	he	1114	“ Bec , ”
110553	110556	110557	110557	he	1114	“ Fuck , ”
110595	110600	110601	110601	he	1114	“ I ’m sorry , ”
110610	110616	110617	110617	I	113	“ Do n’t be sorry , ”
110621	110627	110617	110617	I	113	“ That was pretty exciting . ”
110628	110637	110638	110638	He	1114	“ No . I know . I ’m … ”
110641	110666	110638	110638	He	1114	“ I ’m sorry for the trouble I ’m about to cause you . And for pinning you to my sofa before explaining myself . ”
110678	110689	110672	110672	I	113	“ How bad could it be after that , right ? ”
110744	110752	110753	110753	He	1114	“ I made a mess of you . ”
110758	110767	110753	110753	He	1114	“ Your dress is so pretty , too . ”
110802	110810	110811	110811	His	1114	“ Tell me what ’s the matter . ”
110829	110834	110835	110835	He	1114	“ Let ’s sit . ”
110846	110853	110835	110835	He	1114	“ Huh . Come over here . ”
110909	110936	110901	110901	Nate	1114	“ Remember when I said I was n’t that complicated ? Swear to God I thought it was true . I have a confession to make . ”
110950	110967	110937	110937	My	113	“ Alex is two or three months pregnant , and she needs to rule me out . ”
110968	110971	110972	110972	I	113	“ Pregnant ? ”
110984	110987	110972	110972	I	113	“ With … ”
111008	111036	110996	110996	I	113	“ I asked if you and Alex were ever a thing . You said you hooked up only once , and I thought you meant in college . ”
111042	111048	111049	111049	He	1114	“ It was only once . ”
111054	111083	111049	111049	He	1114	“ And the timing … that ’s what I wanted you to think . Did n’t want you to know how stupid I was one time in March . ”
111095	111106	111107	111107	I	113	“ So you might be having a baby with Alex , ”
111110	111140	111107	111107	I	113	“ There ’s a slight chance , but she needed to check . The other guy is much more likely . But he ’s also somebody who hit her . ”
111146	111150	111141	111141	My	113	“ That fucker . ”
111151	111154	111155	111155	Nate	1114	“ Yeah . ”
111160	111189	111155	111155	Nate	1114	“ I ’m , uh , stunned too . And pissed at myself . It ’s not how I would have wanted our first year together to go . ”
111190	111196	111197	111197	I	113	“ If it ’s yours , ”
111200	111204	111197	111197	I	113	“ Then what ? ”
111208	111258	111205	111205	Nate	1114	“ I got this news about five minutes before you walked in . No idea what would happen . I ’d want to be involved , if that ’s what Alex wanted . With the baby . Not Alex . I love you and that wo n’t ever change . ”
111348	111353	111354	111354	I	113	“ Jeez , slick , ”
111357	111370	111354	111354	I	113	“ You screw up once and there ’s a paternity test later ? ”
111371	111374	111375	111375	His	1114	“ Yeah . ”
111381	111394	111375	111375	His	1114	“ When I make a mistake , I make a real splash . ”
111395	111400	111401	111401	I	113	“ Oh , Nate . ”
111412	111423	111401	111401	I	113	“ I ’m sorry . Poor Alex . Poor you . ”
111424	111451	111375	111375	His	1114	“ I ’ll be fine . It would n’t even shake me up if I were n’t trying hard to convince you I ’m a catch . ”
111452	111456	111401	111401	I	113	“ You are ? ”
111457	111465	111375	111375	His	1114	“ Trying to convince you ? Always . ”
111468	111492	111495	111495	I	113	“ You are a catch . Although if you and Alex end up having a baby together I will be so incredibly jealous . ”
111521	111533	111516	111516	he	113	“ It ’s something I ’d much rather do with you . ”
111566	111595	111516	111516	he	113	“ Becca , it took me seven years to figure out how much I need you . I ’m never letting anyone get in the way of that . ”
111596	111602	111603	111603	I	113	“ It ’ll be okay , ”
111622	111630	111608	111608	we	2228	“ How long will the results take ? ”
111631	111637	111638	111638	He	113	“ Not long . Actually … ”
111656	111667	111668	111668	He	113	“ Alex left this for you . I almost forgot . ”
111814	111820	111821	111821	Nate	1114	“ What did she say ? ”
111835	111849	111830	111830	My	113	“ She said she ’s sorry . It ’s a really nice note . ”
111850	111878	111821	111821	Nate	1114	“ Hallelujah . Alex has been a good friend to me over the years . I could n’t take it if she was n’t nice to you . ”
111886	111892	111893	111893	he	1114	“ Want to get coffee ? ”
111896	111914	111893	111893	he	1114	“ Fuck it . I think I ’m going to blow off the rest of my day . ”
111915	111920	111879	111879	We	2234	“ Really ? Wow . ”
111934	111943	111944	111944	he	1114	“ Hey — what were you downtown for ? ”
111954	111963	111949	111949	I	113	“ We ’ll talk about it another time . ”
111964	111968	111969	111969	he	1114	“ Hit me , ”
111972	111978	111969	111969	he	1114	“ I can take it . ”
111979	111987	111949	111949	I	113	“ Well , I ’m not pregnant . ”
111991	111997	111988	111988	He	1114	“ We could fix that . ”
111998	112003	112004	112004	I	113	“ You ’re hilarious . ”
112010	112025	112004	112004	I	113	“ Okay . Do n’t freak out , but I had a job interview . ”
112029	112036	112026	112026	Nate	1114	“ A job ? For you ? ”
112037	112040	112041	112041	I	113	“ Yeah , ”
112045	112077	112041	112041	I	113	“ This job probably is n’t the one for me . Just a random phone call and a quick meeting . But looking around is just something I want to consider . ”
112093	112114	112078	112078	Nate	1114	“ Bec , I actually feel worse about this than about the twelve percent chance that I got Alex pregnant . ”
112130	112148	112118	112119	Trust Nate	1114	“ I did n’t say I was quitting for sure . I ’m just kicking tires here . ”
112205	112222	112201	112201	He	1114	“ It ’s your whole life . You said so yourself . You love the team . ”
112223	112227	112228	112228	I	113	“ I know . ”
112233	112300	112228	112228	I	113	“ But I love you , too . So I just want to think about what else is out there for me — and where I could work where I was n’t the owner ’s girlfriend . I might not make a move ; I just want to try on the idea . So I ’m telling you now , so you wo n’t be shocked . ”
112314	112346	112301	112301	Nate	1114	“ You do whatever you have to do . I only want you to be happy . But before you lock it down , promise we ’ll talk about it again ? ”
112353	112357	112301	112301	Nate	1114	“ I promise . ”
112358	112364	112380	112380	Lauren	91	“ Thanks for being great . ”
112365	112373	112374	112374	He	1114	“ You ’re not so bad yourself . ”
112398	112402	112403	112403	he	1114	“ Cancel it , ”
112407	112422	112403	112403	he	1114	“ I ’m not feeling so great and I ’m going to head home . ”
112423	112426	112427	112427	I	113	“ Um … ”
112437	112445	112427	112427	I	113	“ Okay ? I ’ll tell them . ”
112563	112566	112567	112567	Rebecca	2523	“ Treviiii ! ”
112572	112579	112567	112567	Rebecca	2523	“ Man on ! Watch your … ”
112901	112915	112886	112886	Lauren	91	“ Check your phone , Nate . Alex is trying to reach you . ”
112938	112943	112944	112944	she	2523	“ Whip it out , ”
112947	112957	112944	112944	she	2523	“ Let ’s see what she has to say . ”
112967	112976	112958	112958	I	113	“ You know I love you , right ? ”
112989	113002	112977	112977	She	2523	“ I know , bossman . Just look at the damned text . ”
113056	113059	113060	113060	Becca	2523	“ Well , ”
113064	113068	113060	113060	Becca	2523	“ Poor Alex . ”
113095	113101	113088	113088	I	113	“ Sorry for that drama . ”
113102	113107	113108	113108	she	2523	“ It ’s okay , ”
113111	113120	113108	113108	she	2523	“ Your mom is texting you , too . ”
113128	113135	113136	113136	I	113	“ She ’s watching the game , ”
113143	113156	113136	113136	I	113	“ I ’ll get the mom download later . Want a drink ? ”
113157	113160	113161	113161	She	2523	“ Sure ! ”
113167	113173	113161	113161	She	2523	“ I ’ll have whatever . ”
113390	113395	113396	113396	Stew	143	“ Where ’s mine ? ”
113522	113526	113527	113527	Becca	2523	“ STOP HIM , ”
113723	113727	113728	113728	Becca	2523	“ Oh no , ”
113736	113740	113728	113728	Becca	2523	“ Goddamn it . ”
113745	113749	113741	113741	I	113	“ So close . ”
113750	113754	113755	113755	she	2523	“ Goddamn it ! ”
113758	113770	113755	113755	she	2523	“ Palacio ! I ’m gon na rip off his arms . ”
113797	113813	113791	113791	Becca	2523	“ That should have been us . I ’m wearing my lucky bra and everything . ”
113945	113952	113953	113953	Georgia	95	“ Let ’s go , guys , ”
113957	113972	113953	113953	Georgia	95	“ Time to go downstairs and smile and show what good sports we are . ”
113973	113977	113978	113978	Becca	2523	“ Oh joy , ”
113981	113991	113978	113978	Becca	2523	“ Ca n’t we just sneak out the back ? ”
113992	113998	113999	113999	Georgia	95	“ In a few minutes , ”
114002	114013	113999	113999	Georgia	95	“ I ’m sure Nate wants to thank his players . ”
114024	114029	114030	114030	I	113	“ Let ’s go , ”
114036	114054	114030	114030	I	113	“ The sooner we go downstairs , the sooner we can get the hell out of Dallas . ”
114055	114066	114067	114067	Becca	2523	“ Now it ’s my least favorite city , too , ”
114100	114116	114117	114117	I	113	“ The people of Brooklyn can be really proud of how far we ’ve come , ”
114179	114188	114189	114189	I	113	“ We ’ll get ‘ em next year , ”
114192	114208	114189	114189	I	113	“ Take a nice long vacation . Rest up . Invest in a Dallas dartboard . ”
114226	114233	114216	114216	Becca	2523	“ Gettin ’ rowdy out here , ”
114352	114357	114358	114358	Bec	1117	“ We could walk , ”
114373	114378	114380	114380	Gary	337	“ Not this time , ”
114386	114406	114380	114380	Gary	337	“ Half of Dallas is crowding around the stadium to celebrate . The car ’s ETA is four minutes . ”
114407	114410	114411	114411	I	113	“ Fine , ”
114425	114433	114411	114411	I	113	“ Shall we step outside to wait ? ”
114434	114440	114441	114441	Gary	337	“ Lotta cameras out there , ”
114686	114689	114690	114690	she	2523	“ Hi , ”
114699	114733	114690	114690	she	2523	“ God . I ’m so sorry about that story in the Post . The reporter called and I told her to go find a real story . I hung up on her . ”
114734	114739	114740	114740	Nate	1114	“ It ’s okay , ”
114744	114765	114740	114740	Nate	1114	“ Was n’t the first dumb thing anyone ever wrote about me . And it wo n’t be the last . ”
114766	114769	114770	114770	Juliet	120	“ Well … ”
114791	114803	114740	114740	Nate	1114	“ Yo . Juliet ! Where the fuck did you go ? ”
114804	114807	114808	114808	Her	2523	“ Uh … ”
114821	114831	114832	114832	She	2523	“ I ’m sorry anyway . It was shitty . ”
114836	114848	114832	114832	She	2523	“ You look good . I hope you ’re doing well . ”
114849	114856	114857	114857	His	1114	“ Ca n’t complain at all . ”
114875	114892	114857	114857	His	1114	“ And , uh , you look great , too . Congratulations , by the way . ”
114893	114896	114897	114898	a man	759	“ Juliet ! ”
114903	114910	114897	114898	a man	759	“ Get the fuck down here ! ”
114951	114957	114935	114935	he	2301	“ Am I interrupting something ? ”
114958	114961	114962	114962	Juliet	120	“ No , ”
114970	114975	114962	114962	Juliet	120	“ Of course not . ”
114976	114985	114986	114986	He	1114	“ So get your fat ass back here . ”
114995	114999	114986	114986	He	1114	“ Picture time . ”
115033	115048	115027	115027	My	113	“ What the hell was that ? Who speaks to his wife that way ? ”
115059	115062	115063	115063	he	1114	“ Jesus , ”
115069	115077	115055	115055	he	1114	“ He ’s worse than I remember . ”
115144	115149	115150	115150	Gary	337	“ Car ’s here ! ”
115154	115159	115150	115150	Gary	337	“ Let ’s roll . ”
115273	115278	115279	115279	I	113	“ Are you okay ? ”
115297	115307	115308	115308	He	1114	“ Yeah , of course . It ’s just … ”
115313	115375	115293	115293	He	1114	“ That stupid article had a grain of truth to it . I had a lot of reasons for buying the team . But one of them , at least , was that I could just picture beating Dallas in the playoffs on their home ice . I do n’t , like , sit around and think about her , though … ”
115376	115380	115381	115381	I	113	“ I know , ”
115393	115429	115385	115385	He	1114	“ But I always just assumed she was happier , you know ? It ’s worse that she is n’t . Never mind . I ’m sorry to talk about her . That ’s rude . ”
115430	115449	115385	115385	He	1114	“ No ! It is n’t . But I did n’t know smart girls could be so stupid . ”
115453	115468	115469	115469	He	1114	“ Smart people are stupid all the time . Ask me how I know . ”
115495	115509	115489	115489	we	2315	“ Tonight has been rough so far . But maybe it ’s salvageable . ”
115606	115613	115614	115614	I	113	“ There ’s always next year , ”
115635	115646	115628	115628	he	1114	“ We ’ll be there to see it . Together . ”
115657	115677	115649	115649	me	113	“ Even if I ’m working someplace else , I would n’t miss sitting in the box with you . ”
115678	115684	115685	115685	he	1114	“ Speaking of making plans , ”
115696	115708	115685	115685	he	1114	“ I have a proposition I want to discuss with you . ”
115709	115714	115719	115719	he	1114	“ What ’s that ? ”
115780	115784	115787	115787	myself	113	“ Holy crap ! ”
115833	115838	115839	115839	Sweetheart	2815	“ Rebecca . Sweetheart — ”
115841	115892	115839	115839	Sweetheart	2815	“ Will you marry me ? I know it ’s fast . But it is n’t , really . Seven years seems like plenty of time to figure out that you ’re my favorite person in the world . And I do n’t want to go another year without you . ”
116011	116016	116017	116017	I	113	“ Y - yes , ”
116027	116031	116017	116017	I	113	“ I will . ”
116049	116053	116054	116054	he	1114	“ Thank you , ”
116059	116067	116054	116054	he	1114	“ My timing is weird , but … ”
116083	116086	116087	116087	He	1114	“ Bec . ”
116093	116111	116087	116087	He	1114	“ Do n’t you want to see the ring ? You could choose any style you want … ”
116112	116117	116118	116118	I	113	“ It ’s beautiful , ”
116159	116170	116140	116140	I	113	“ Wow . Fancy . I love it so much . ”
116219	116224	116225	116225	he	1114	“ I love you , ”
116228	116235	116236	116236	I	113	“ I love you , too . ”
116266	116278	116261	116261	His	1114	“ It ’s okay if it gets wet , you know . ”
116279	116284	116285	116285	I	113	“ Not with me , ”
116288	116298	116285	116285	I	113	“ There ’s a small fortune on my finger . ”
116299	116304	116261	116261	His	1114	“ It ’s insured . ”
116307	116330	116331	116331	he	1114	“ Listen , I know I just blew your mind a little bit , but I need to blow it some more , ”
116334	116337	116338	116338	I	113	“ Okay ? ”
116381	116395	116369	116369	Nate	1114	“ Marrying me is more complicated than dating me . There ’s paperwork . ”
116396	116405	116406	116406	I	113	“ Oh , I do n’t doubt it , ”
116415	116427	116406	116406	I	113	“ I ’ll sign whatever prenup your lawyer can dream up . ”
116431	116445	116428	116428	He	1114	“ There has to be a prenup . Can I tell you why ? ”
116446	116454	116369	116369	Nate	1114	“ Because you have a billion dollars ? ”
116455	116461	116462	116462	He	1114	“ That ’s not why . ”
116475	116515	116462	116462	He	1114	“ It ’s because of my voting rights . If someone thought the power structure of KTech could be put into play by our divorce , then someone might decide he has millions to gain by breaking us up . ”
116516	116519	116520	116520	I	113	“ Oh , ”
116524	116529	116520	116520	I	113	“ That ’s creepy . ”
116568	116571	116572	116572	he	1114	“ Yeah , ”
116576	116622	116572	116572	he	1114	“ So the prenup will have to give me all my KTech shares . But I do n’t think you ’ll care , because there ’s a wedding gift I want to give you . And it ’s important to me that you accept it . ”
116623	116656	116680	116680	his	1114	“ Um … I do n’t need anything , Nate . I never really cared about your big bucks , except I do n’t mind when you pick up the dinner check . ”
116668	116672	116673	116673	he	1114	“ I know , ”
116730	116763	116680	116680	his	1114	“ The gift you ’re getting is a certain hockey franchise . They made a recent run at the championship , and I think they ’ll continue to flourish under new leadership . ”
116764	116767	116768	116768	I	113	“ What ? ”
116788	116824	116680	116680	his	1114	“ You ’re going to be the new owner of the Brooklyn Bruisers . You wo n’t be shtupping the boss anymore . But I expect to have sex in your office at least once . ”
116838	116844	116825	116825	My	113	“ Own … the team ? ”
116850	116898	116825	116825	My	113	“ Yeah , baby . You ’ll be great . I ’ve had a good run , and you ’re going to be able to give it more attention than I probably should . And nobody loves the Bruisers more , right ? So why not you ? ”
116899	116905	116975	116975	I	113	“ Because it ’s yours ? ”
116906	116911	116912	116912	He	1114	“ Not for long . ”
116921	116973	116912	116912	He	1114	“ I need you more than I need to own the team . And I want you to have it . We might have to get married before I can sign it over . It ’s because of gift taxes . Or something . My accountant can explain it to you . ”
117055	117062	117063	117063	I	113	“ I still have some questions , ”
117118	117121	117122	117122	Nate	1114	“ Shoot , ”
117129	117138	117179	117179	He	1114	“ Are your parents going to be upset ? ”
117139	117158	117179	117179	He	1114	“ About what ? My mom loves you . Everyone loves you . We ’ve been over this . ”
117159	117178	117179	117179	He	1114	“ But I ’m a shiksa . Do n’t they want you to marry a nice Jewish girl ? ”
117187	117205	117179	117179	He	1114	“ News flash — my mom is n’t Jewish . Marrying shiksas is already a family tradition . ”
117206	117209	117210	117210	I	113	“ Really ? ”
117215	117229	117179	117179	He	1114	“ Really . If that ’s your big concern , we ’re covered . ”
117258	117261	117262	117262	I	113	“ Nate , ”
117267	117279	117262	117262	I	113	“ I do n’t know anything about being a team owner . ”
117280	117317	117262	117262	I	113	“ But you do . It ’s a job where the major requirement is you pay attention and you care . And nobody cares more than you , Bec ; you ’re going to do great . ”
117318	117326	117262	117262	I	113	“ It ’s just hard to picture . ”
117327	117377	117262	117262	I	113	“ Not for me . You can promote your intern and do less of the grunt work yourself . That frees up your time for more big - picture questions . Some of them are fun . Like — what focus would you choose for the foundation next year ? ”
117378	117383	117384	117384	I	113	“ Head injury research , ”
117388	117391	117392	117392	Nate	1114	“ See ? ”
117398	117418	117392	117392	Nate	1114	“ Any work you do there is at least as important as hiring the right vendors in the stadium . ”
117419	117434	117435	117435	Nate	1114	“ We ’re in charge of the food ? The cheese puffs are staying . ”
117438	117472	117435	117435	Nate	1114	“ Luckily , I ’m leaving you with no immediate problems to solve . Your stadium lease is good for another eight years , and Hugh Major and Coach are n’t going anywhere . ”
117473	117479	117262	117262	I	113	“ God I hope not . ”
117480	117536	117435	117435	Nate	1114	“ Do n’t worry ! I ’ll always help you . But it wo n’t take you long to realize you already know almost as much about owning a hockey team as I do . And baby — when we need answers , you ’ll just hire some finance nerd or legal geek who knows . ”
117537	117549	117262	117262	I	113	“ I ’m going to be in over my head sometimes . ”
117550	117585	117586	117586	He	2322	“ Sure . Like anyone who ever tried something new . I have faith in you . That organization is better with you in it . My life is better with you in it . ”
117599	117610	117586	117586	He	2322	“ Please be my partner in this and all things . ”
117648	117658	117636	117636	Nate	1114	“ Will you move in with me right away ? ”
117659	117662	117666	117666	I	113	“ I … ”
117676	117679	117666	117666	I	113	“ Sure . ”
117680	117738	117636	117636	Nate	1114	“ You can change things in that house , you know . If you do n’t like the setup , we ’ll work on it . But if you do n’t hate it too much , I ’d like to stay . There ’s enough room on the property for the security team to do its job . ”
117739	117766	117666	117666	I	113	“ Okay . I ’m sure I can find a way to be comfortable in a few of your twelve rooms or however many there are . ”
117772	117811	117767	117767	He	2325	“ I want you to feel at home , Bec . Not just be comfortable . But we ’ll work on it . Meanwhile , your sister and her family will enjoy a little more room , right ? ”
117812	117815	117816	117816	I	113	“ Right … ”
117820	117836	117816	117816	I	113	“ I just signed a new lease . That ought to hold them a while . ”
117837	117841	117842	117842	Nate	1114	“ Or forever , ”
117845	117859	117842	117842	Nate	1114	“ There ’s a note in your file not to raise the rent . ”
117860	117863	117864	117864	My	113	“ What ? ”
117871	117877	117864	117864	My	113	“ You own that building ? ”
117878	117906	117945	117945	Nate	1114	“ Sure . When I built the practice facility I bought up everything that was for sale in the neighborhood . And when you relocated to Brooklyn … ”
117907	117919	117920	117920	I	113	“ The Bruisers ’ real estate agent showed me that apartment . ”
117939	117944	117920	117920	I	113	“ That ’s sneaky . ”
117950	117991	117992	117992	He	1114	“ You did n’t have to pick that place . But I was happy you did . It let me look out for you in a small way . You know — back when I loved you only from afar . ”
118011	118025	118002	118003	Mr. Darcy	151	“ What kind of wedding do you want ? You can pick anything . ”
118026	118037	118038	118040	The poor man	1114	“ Not sure yet . Many magazines will be consulted . ”
118045	118052	118038	118040	The poor man	1114	“ Can we keep it small ? ”
118053	118056	118002	118003	Mr. Darcy	151	“ Sure ? ”
118057	118089	118038	118040	The poor man	1114	“ I mean — family , close friends , and the hockey team . With you it would be easy to end up accidentally inviting half of KTech and Goldman Sachs . ”
118090	118110	118002	118003	Mr. Darcy	151	“ Why do n’t we rent out a small hotel somewhere in the Caribbean and have a destination wedding ? ”
118111	118117	118038	118040	The poor man	1114	“ That would be fun . ”
118118	118140	118002	118003	Mr. Darcy	151	“ It keeps the numbers down and guarantees you ’ll have to wear a bikini at least part of the time . ”
118141	118150	118038	118040	The poor man	1114	“ You have a one - track mind . ”
118151	118156	118157	118157	He	1114	“ No — four . ”
118167	118176	118157	118157	He	1114	“ Tech . Hockey . Food . Rebecca . ”
118177	118186	118187	118187	I	113	“ That ’s a lot like my list , ”
118190	118199	118187	118187	I	113	“ Food . Fashion . Hockey . Nate . ”
118200	118208	118209	118209	he	1114	“ Three outa four ai n’t bad , ”
118244	118254	118293	118295	Rebecca Rowley Kattenberger	115	“ Screaming is pretty common on the maternity ward , ”
118269	118282	118293	118295	Rebecca Rowley Kattenberger	115	“ But it ’s usually about childbirth , and not about hockey . ”
118361	118375	118376	118377	Mrs. Kattenberger	167	“ I thought — this is fine , it ’s not a disaster , ”
118384	118406	118376	118377	Mrs. Kattenberger	167	“ If the series goes to game seven , the baby and I can make an appearance at the Brooklyn arena . ”
118436	118443	118444	118445	Nurse Dawn	341	“ Labor did not progress rapidly , ”
118448	118490	118444	118445	Nurse Dawn	341	“ That ’s normal for a first birth . The doctor wanted to give her an oxytocin drip to move things along , but she said , ‘ Not until the third period . What if we go into overtime ? ’ ”
118567	118599	118600	118600	Dawn	341	“ During a tense part of the game , we reassured nearby patients that everything was just fine . And when Brooklyn won , everyone on the ward was pretty excited , ”
118603	118640	118600	118600	Dawn	341	“ Rebecca ’s baby waited . Things went much faster after we shut off the television . She was ready to push about two hours later , and the baby was born an hour after that . ”
118791	118815	118785	118786	Nurse Dawn	341	“ We had a baby born in the elevator just last week . You got to be pretty creative to catch us unawares . ”
