9580	9586	9576	9576	he	533	“ We should catch up . ”
9616	9624	9625	9625	she	114	“ It ’s not a good idea , ”
9629	9635	9636	9636	she	114	“ People remember . . . ”
9641	9646	9636	9636	she	114	“ They ’ll talk . ”
9720	9730	9731	9731	she	114	“ Bus to the airport leaves at six thirty , ”
9740	9746	9731	9731	she	114	“ Do n’t be late . ”
9747	9751	9731	9731	she	114	“ All right . ”
9796	9801	9776	9776	They	590	“ Heyyyy , Beak ! ”
9802	9807	9776	9776	They	590	“ Get over here ! ”
9810	9820	9821	9821	She	114	“ Hey , it ’s Lauren ! No way . ”
9871	9876	9877	9877	O’Doul	92	“ Shit , man , ”
9886	9894	9877	9877	O’Doul	92	“ You and she patching things up ? ”
9895	9902	9903	9903	He	533	“ Does it look like it ? ”
9910	9916	9903	9903	He	533	“ What are we drinking ? ”
10615	10628	10607	10608	His boys	625	“ Crazy bitch ! Did n’t know how good she had it . ”
10629	10640	10641	10642	His teammates	538	“ The tennis pro ? There ’s a fucking cliché . ”
10816	10833	10834	10834	someone	606	“ Twenty bucks says the tennis pro will drop her by the end of the month , ”
10994	10999	11000	11000	she	114	“ Just a second ! ”
11137	11140	11141	11141	he	2343	“ Hi , ”
11177	11181	11182	11182	He	2343	“ You okay ? ”
11185	11194	11182	11182	He	2343	“ Yeah . It is what it is . ”
11214	11230	11231	11231	She	114	“ I , uh , if you ’re studying , we can talk another time . ”
11249	11256	11257	11257	Her	114	“ No . It ’s okay . ”
11265	11272	11273	11273	she	114	“ Have n’t seen you around , ”
11277	11283	11273	11273	she	114	“ Sorry for your troubles . ”
11284	11297	11257	11257	Her	114	“ I suppose I ’m this month ’s gossip at the office . ”
11298	11301	11302	11302	She	114	“ Yeah . ”
11308	11331	11332	11332	He	2343	“ They live for this stuff . But only until the next juicy disaster comes along . And there ’s always something . ”
11493	11496	11497	11497	she	114	“ Michael , ”
11500	11505	11497	11497	she	114	“ Hey , now . ”
11522	11527	11517	11517	Lauren	114	“ Want a beer ? ”
11528	11533	11534	11534	he	2343	“ Am I breathing ? ”
11600	11605	11606	11606	she	114	“ Have a seat , ”
11728	11736	11737	11737	she	114	“ It ’s that color of blue , ”
11742	11754	11737	11737	she	114	“ I ’ve never seen it anywhere but on a hydrangea . ”
11826	11830	11831	11831	he	2343	“ Nice place , ”
11940	11950	11928	11928	He	135	“ Get off your ass and make it happen , ”
12047	12051	12052	12052	he	135	“ Thank you , ”
12175	12200	12169	12169	he	135	“ I feel like I ’m house - sitting , you know ? Maybe it wo n’t be so weird once we start traveling . ”
12279	12284	12285	12285	he	135	“ You were studying , ”
12299	12304	12285	12285	he	135	“ I should go . ”
12305	12308	12309	12309	she	114	“ Okay , ”
12313	12321	12309	12309	she	114	“ Just . . . leave it . ”
12336	12339	12340	12340	he	135	“ Thanks , ”
12391	12399	12379	12379	She	114	“ I ’ll see you at work . ”
12400	12403	12404	12404	He	135	“ Right . ”
12425	12434	12419	12419	She	114	“ Sit down , just for another minute . ”
12440	12455	12435	12435	She	114	“ Are you really okay ? Would you tell me if you were n’t ? ”
12456	12459	12460	12460	His	135	“ Yeah . ”
12489	12492	12493	12493	she	114	“ Okay , ”
12496	12511	12493	12493	she	114	“ I worry about you . I hope you ’re taking care of yourself . ”
12753	12756	12757	12757	he	135	“ Lo , ”
12760	12763	12764	12764	She	114	“ Hey . ”
12769	12774	12764	12764	She	114	“ Look at me . ”
12881	12884	12885	12885	she	114	“ Fuck , ”
12952	12955	12956	12956	she	114	“ Mike , ”
13369	13372	13350	13350	She	114	“ Fuck , ”
13676	13682	13683	13683	he	135	“ Need you so bad , ”
13711	13714	13715	13715	she	114	“ Mike , ”
13929	13932	13933	13933	he	135	“ Lo , ”
13940	13945	13933	13933	he	135	“ Look at me . ”
13961	13964	13965	13965	he	135	“ Hey , ”
13968	14043	13965	13965	he	135	“ There ’s two things that could happen now . The first one is I go home and spend the next year trying not to remember this happened , or how happy it made me . I ’ll do that if you really want me to . The second choice is that I carry you to your shower for a rinse down , and then we do it several more times in your bed . ”
14060	14067	14068	14068	he	135	“ Do n’t freak , honey , ”
14071	14085	14068	14068	he	135	“ This was n’t an accident or a fluke . It was inevitable . ”
14086	14090	13965	13965	he	135	“ I know . ”
14091	14099	14068	14068	he	135	“ So why do you look sad ? ”
14100	14114	14068	14068	he	135	“ I ’m not the least bit sad . I ’m just astonished . ”
14115	14123	13965	13965	he	135	“ Why ? Because it was good ? ”
14124	14145	14068	14068	he	135	“ No . That it finally happened , and it was just as amazing as I knew it would be . ”
14146	14154	14155	14155	Her	114	“ That ’s because I love you . ”
14160	14163	14155	14155	Her	114	“ Mike . ”
14164	14192	14193	14193	Lauren	114	“ What ? I ca n’t say that ? Like it is n’t fucking obvious ? There ’s probably nobody in your office who does n’t know . ”
14197	14206	14193	14193	Lauren	114	“ The gossip is going to be awful . ”
14207	14215	14216	14216	She	114	“ Maybe . But do we care ? ”
14233	14247	14216	14216	She	114	“ I might not even notice , so long as I have you . ”
14248	14251	14252	14252	He	135	“ Mmm . ”
14269	14275	14276	14276	She	114	“ Good answer , Lo . ”
14295	14303	14304	14304	he	135	“ I ’m not going home tonight , ”
14307	14322	14323	14323	Lauren	114	“ I want to lie in your bed and taste every inch of you . ”
14348	14369	14336	14336	He	135	“ Would this be a horrible time to ask if you ’re , uh , on the pill or something ? ”
14383	14391	14370	14370	She	114	“ Lucky for you , I am . ”
14392	14397	14398	14398	He	135	“ Good to know . ”
14415	14434	14370	14370	She	114	“ Obviously I ’m a shoot - first - and - ask - questions - later kinda guy . ”
14435	14440	14441	14441	she	114	“ I noticed that , ”
14699	14704	14696	14696	Lauren	114	“ Are you Silas ? ”
14705	14710	14711	14712	the kid	1931	“ That ’s me , ”
14723	14726	14711	14712	the kid	1931	“ Dude ! ”
14727	14730	14696	14696	Lauren	114	“ Silas ! ”
14731	14737	14711	14712	the kid	1931	“ Long time no see ! ”
14807	14814	14815	14815	she	114	“ Silas , I ’m Lauren , ”
14825	14837	14815	14815	she	114	“ I ’m filling in for Becca while she ’s out . ”
14838	14846	14847	14847	he	1931	“ Nice to meet you , Lauren , ”
14868	14875	14876	14876	she	114	“ Here is your team ID , ”
14893	14923	14876	14876	she	114	“ And your boarding pass . If you have any questions , you ’ll find me in your Katt Phone under Lauren . And welcome back to the Bruisers . ”
14924	14930	14931	14931	he	1931	“ Thank you , miss , ”
14938	14946	14931	14931	he	1931	“ It ’s good to be back . ”
15345	15361	15362	15362	Elsa	2199	“ . . . To a dance party with my friends from my old school , ”
15366	15384	15362	15362	Elsa	2199	“ Hans is driving me out to Long Island . It ’s my BFF ’s birthday today . ”
15385	15391	15392	15392	O’Doul	92	“ Well you look amazing , ”
15399	15421	15422	15422	Elsa	2199	“ Do n’t dance with any boys or your dad will have to fly back from D.C. and knock some heads . ”
15473	15479	15461	15461	Mike	2343	“ Be good for Hans . ”
15480	15487	15489	15489	her	481	“ Do n’t blow game five , ”
15717	15724	15725	15725	she	730	“ What ’s she doing here ? ”
15764	15769	15770	15770	he	2343	“ Elsa , Jesus , ”
15936	15942	15943	15943	he	92	“ Can I take that ? ”
15946	15949	15950	15950	she	114	“ What ? ”
15976	15986	15987	15987	she	114	“ Oh . Yes . Please . Thank you , ”
16499	16854	16496	16496	He	759	” , dark brown hair , 187 pounds . His father had been treated for prostate cancer , but there were no other significant medical issues in the family . Her gaze lingered on that baby picture . A science nerd who liked music — that was appealing . The process was oddly like reading profiles on a dating site . No matter how cute he ’d been as a toddler , donor 87455 was a real , flawed person out in the world somewhere . He might be charming and kind . Then again , he might have an irritating laugh and a mean streak . Did it matter , though ? If she had a baby , it would be the two of them against the world . She squinted down at the smiling boy on the page , imagining what a blend of her genes and his would look like . She turned the page and read the next profile again . She ’d narrowed it down to these five finalists , out of the thousands on the sperm bank ’s website . Once she made a decision , the winning sperm would be FedExed to her doctor in time for her ovulation date . Each vial of sperm cost a whopping $ 600 , and the insemination procedure itself would set her back more than a thousand more . Luckily , the Kattenberger corporation had excellent health benefits , including fertility coverage . During the open enrollment period last fall , she ’d switched to the Platinum plan specifically with this strategy in mind . A shadow fell over her page . Lauren slammed the folder shut and glared in the direction of whoever had disturbed her . Of course her visitor turned out to be Mike Beacon , who did n’t seem to take notice of her obvious wish to be left alone . The jerk even lifted up the satchel she ’d left guarding the empty seat and tucked it under the chair in front of him , sitting down beside her . Damn . It . All . “
16857	16909	16910	16910	Lauren	114	” he said quietly . Lauren spread her hand onto the cover of the folder and stared down at her shiny fingernails . If she had a child in a year or so , weekly manicures would have to fall by the wayside . But she was ready for a change . “
16912	16920	16910	16910	Lauren	114	” he said , his voice rough . “
16946	16947	16936	16936	I	91	” “
16951	16956	16936	16936	I	91	” she said quickly . “
16961	16962	16963	16963	Lauren	114	” “
16965	17006	16963	16963	Lauren	114	” he whispered . The sound of her name on his lips scraped her insides raw . And when she lifted her chin to meet his dark eyes , she got a little trapped in the warmth she found there . “
17009	17023	16963	16963	Lauren	114	” she said a little sharply , if only to break the spell . “
17045	17046	17029	17029	You	114	” “
17049	17086	17029	17029	You	114	” She should n’t pick a fight with him . That way lay the abyss . But could he really be so clueless ? He blinked , and the light in his eyes dimmed a little . “
17099	17100	17101	17101	Riiiight	148	” “
17103	17108	17109	17109	Elsa	2199	” Lauren said slowly . “
17152	17158	17148	17148	they	588	” His rugged brow furrowed . “
17162	17163	17165	17165	me	91	” “
17167	17188	17165	17165	me	91	” She knew she should just let this go . But discomfort had churned in her gut for weeks now . “
17196	17209	17191	17191	I	91	room”—that ’s where the wives and families wait for the players after the game—“to
17230	17231	17218	17219	Those women	765	” “
17234	17239	17218	17219	Those women	765	” Why . Jesus . “
17263	17269	17251	17251	I	91	” Mike ’s jaw dropped . “
17282	17283	17251	17251	I	91	” “
17286	17290	17251	17251	I	91	” she hissed . “
17354	17360	17365	17365	Lauren	114	” He gaped at her . “
17376	17377	17367	17367	He	442	” “
17386	17400	17401	17401	You	772	” she snapped , realizing with horror that she was about to cry . “
17432	17443	17445	17451	the only one who really harmed me	774	Because”—She gulped back her tears and looked him straight in the eye—“who
17453	17467	17468	17468	I	91	” She knew her point hit home because his face went absolutely pale . “
17471	17472	17468	17468	I	91	” “
17492	17522	17524	17524	you	772	” Now her eyes were stinging and her throat was closing up . Lauren stood up in a hurry , but his giant body was in the freaking way . “
17531	17635	17642	17642	man	533	” she whispered hoarsely . He leaped out of the seat and into the aisle . Without another glance at him Lauren exited the row and darted forward , into the bathroom at the front of the plane . It was — thank the sweet heavens — unoccupied . The moment the door clicked close , the tears came like a fountain . She yanked a paper towel from the holder and pressed it forcefully to her mouth . Alone at last , Lauren clung one - handed to the grab bar and cried absolutely silently in the charter jet ’s bathroom . SIX “
17651	17656	17642	17642	man	533	” Patrick O’Doul complained . “
17661	17688	17689	17689	I	91	” Mike dragged his eyes off the bathroom door at the front of the jet and sat back . He tipped his head back and sighed . “
17698	17699	17689	17689	I	91	” “
17720	17721	17689	17689	I	91	” “
17725	17729	17689	17689	I	91	” Mike argued . “
17772	17784	17767	17767	she	114	” O’Doul made a little grunt of half - assed agreement . “
17794	17795	17789	17789	I	91	” “
17798	17799	17789	17789	I	91	” “
17828	17829	17818	17818	you	91	” “
17840	17849	17835	17835	She	778	” She ’s still the woman I love . “
17854	17855	17835	17835	She	778	” “
17860	17874	17877	17877	Jesus	730	” And — damn him — O’Doul sounded a little smug , too . “
17887	17891	17879	17879	I	91	” O’Doul chuckled . “
17908	17909	17910	17910	She	778	” “
17916	17920	17910	17910	She	778	” Mike admitted . “
17939	17993	17994	17994	I	91	” That had to be true , right ? For two years he ’d assumed that she was in a better place than he was — that his sacrifice had been something she could grow to accept . But the look on her face when he sat down beside her was pure devastation . “
18000	18004	17994	17994	I	91	” he admitted . “
18008	18009	17994	17994	I	91	” “
18012	18025	17994	17994	I	91	” He shook his head . Today was just a ripple effect . “
18053	18057	18049	18049	I	91	” Mike snorted . “
18119	18127	18110	18110	I	91	” O’Doul gave him a sidelong glance . “
18133	18134	18128	18128	You	778	” “
18137	18138	18139	18139	Women	781	” “
18143	18144	18150	18150	captain	782	” “
18161	18165	18150	18150	captain	782	” O’Doul grinned . “
18173	18174	18166	18166	I	91	” “
18179	18217	18166	18166	I	91	” It was true , but only because Ari was the first person he ’d ever dated . And that relationship was about a month old . O’Doul would learn how fricking complicated it could all become . “
18225	18230	18166	18166	I	91	” the captain asked . “
18247	18264	18240	18241	my man	785	” He closed his eyes and let himself remember the most painful time in his life . “
18343	18372	18331	18331	she	2023	” He still remembered getting that phone call . He was in his car after practice , waiting outside the clubhouse office for Lauren to get off work . “
18380	18386	18373	18373	I	91	” his ex had said . “
18393	18408	18409	18409	I	91	” He ’d been eyeing the door , watching for Lauren ’s shapely legs . “
18414	18428	18409	18409	I	91	” There had been a long silence , and he ’d been annoyed . “
18431	18432	18409	18409	I	91	” “
18436	18447	18409	18409	I	91	” she ’d said in a big , breathy rush . “
18450	18465	18409	18409	I	91	” He did n’t think it was possible that she ’d just used the word “
18468	18475	18480	18480	Mike	2343	” She was n’t quite thirty . “
18482	18488	18480	18480	Mike	2343	” she ’d said quietly . “
18499	18553	18480	18480	Mike	2343	” Her tone made his gut turn sideways . But even after that , it had taken another couple months for him to understand how it would all play out . O’Doul was waiting for him to finish the story . But now he did n’t really feel like it . Too painful . “
18569	18570	18573	18573	Lauren	114	” “
18577	18592	18573	18573	Lauren	114	” O’Doul asked . He shook his head slowly . O’Doul ’s eyes narrowed . “
18606	18607	18598	18598	Shelly	2023	” “
18637	18638	18631	18631	her	114	” “
18650	18653	18631	18631	her	114	” Yes . “
18697	18708	18713	18713	man	533	” O’Doul lifted his fingertips to his temples and rubbed . “
18724	18725	18713	18713	man	533	” “
18735	18736	18737	18737	I	91	” “
18743	18930	18737	18737	I	91	” He eyed the door at the front of the plane again . Still closed . Shit . SEVEN LONG ISLAND , NEW YORK MARCH 2014 Mike lay panting in his bed , limbs splayed all over Lauren . He braced himself on an elbow so he would n’t crush her , but he could n’t bring himself to move any farther away from her very naked , very well - fucked body . A half hour ago he ’d come home from the season ’s last big road trip . His suitcase was sitting just inside the bedroom door where he ’d dropped it . On top of it rested a bunch of hydrangeas he ’d picked up on his way home from LaGuardia . He had n’t let Lauren put them in water yet . He ’d pounced on her for a preliminary round of fast , energetic sex . Even if his body was spent , he could n’t stop admiring her beneath him . He pushed a lock of golden hair off her forehead and kissed the ivory skin he ’d revealed . “
18939	18940	18937	18937	baby	793	” “
18943	18948	18937	18937	baby	793	” she answered quickly . “
18951	18966	18937	18937	baby	793	” he yelped , rolling to the side , taking her body with him . “
18979	18986	18971	18971	I	91	” Her laugh was a giggle . “
18996	18997	18988	18988	I	91	” “
19002	19018	18988	18988	I	91	” He cupped her perfect ass in his hand and gave it a friendly squeeze . “
19033	19034	18988	18988	I	91	” “
19037	19050	18988	18988	I	91	” They were supposed to look at a few later this week . “
19076	19084	19061	19061	I	91	” He made a noise of approval . “
19100	19101	19087	19087	I	91	” “
19130	19131	19113	19115	One of them	798	” “
19134	19145	19113	19115	One of them	798	” he said , stroking his fingers up her back . “
19155	19156	19157	19157	I	91	” “
19174	19197	19113	19115	One of them	798	” He laughed , and it shook both of them , so he wrapped his arms around her to hold on tight . “
19207	19208	19113	19115	One of them	798	” “
19232	19233	19224	19224	I	91	” “
19258	19259	19249	19249	We	801	” “
19267	19268	19249	19249	We	801	” “
19271	19272	19249	19249	We	801	” “
19275	19285	19286	19286	I	91	” she mimicked , giving his arm a squeeze . “
19298	19385	19286	19286	I	91	” He liked all of it — every whim she might dream up . They ’d been together a year and a half already , and things were only getting better . The new team owner had stunned Lauren by offering her a job in Manhattan , and stunned everyone by moving the team to Brooklyn . The next chapter of their lives would happen in the city . He was giving up his rental house and Lauren would finally move off her parents ’ property . “
19394	19395	19396	19396	I	91	” “
19410	19414	19396	19396	I	91	” she explained . “
19454	19455	19433	19433	I	91	” “
19463	19574	19433	19433	I	91	” He did n’t have any idea if that was true , but he did n’t want Lauren to worry . Worrying was a waste of time , and it prevented people from living in the moment . That was no good . By definition a goalie needed to be very good at pushing aside the hum of anxiety in his life . Another man might panic when the new team owner started making a lot of changes . Mike had a bad feeling about his ex ’s health problems , too . His entire existence was up in the air , except for Lauren . She was his rock . “
19582	19599	19433	19433	I	91	” he asked her suddenly . Her smooth hand massaged his shoulder with a firm grip . “
19612	19660	19433	19433	I	91	” He stretched lazily on the sheets that Lauren had picked out for the bed . The rental house was better furnished these days , with furniture in all the important rooms . The bedding was silky against his skin , but not as silky as Lauren . “
19692	19693	19687	19687	You	806	” “
19711	19712	19713	19713	Yup	123	” “
19747	19758	19741	19741	I	91	” He ran a hand over Lauren ’s perfect hip . “
19778	19779	19776	19776	Seafood	151	” “
19783	19791	19776	19776	Seafood	151	” She rolled in to hug him . “
19797	19798	19793	19793	I	91	” “
19813	19824	19805	19805	I	91	” That was one of two things he could cook . “
19829	19839	19825	19825	I	91	” She snuggled a little closer into his embrace . “
19866	19875	19861	19861	you	533	” He tugged her up onto his body . “
19899	19900	19888	19888	I	91	” “
19929	19933	19922	19922	They	814	” she said . “
19957	19958	19944	19944	I	91	” “
19964	19976	19977	19977	You	818	” he said , running a finger down her perfect nose . “
20007	20008	20000	20000	we	1881	” “
20011	20038	20039	20039	I	91	” She put her head down on his chest and said nothing further on the topic . It took him a minute to realize his error . “
20065	20066	20067	20067	I	91	” “
20096	20097	20086	20094	these Long Island moms who are moving to Brooklyn	823	” “
20106	20111	20086	20094	these Long Island moms who are moving to Brooklyn	823	” he pointed out . “
20134	20135	20136	20136	He	153	” “
20148	20153	20136	20136	He	153	” Lauren pointed out . “
20171	20172	20156	20156	Coach	102	” “
20184	20185	20175	20177	This kid Castro	826	” “
20188	20241	20242	20242	I	91	” Their pillow talk frequently involved shop talk . When he was with Shelly , she used to complain if he talked about hockey to her , but Lauren did n’t mind at all . It ’s who you are , she ’d said once . And I love who you are . “
20248	20257	20258	20258	I	91	” he said , and then did n’t . “
20261	20273	20258	20258	I	91	” she agreed , and then did n’t slide off him . “
20281	20625	20258	20258	I	91	” he whispered . She kissed his neck in agreement . He wrapped his arms around her to draw out the perfect moment of quiet just a little longer . • • • The drive from his rental house to his old one took about four minutes . Although he ’d moved out a year and a half ago , it was still a little weird to drive up like a guest to the house he ’d bought with Shelly . He parked his car at the curb instead of pulling into the garage like he used to . Same car . Same driveway . New routine . A few times during the past eighteen months , Lauren had come along when he spent time with Elsa . But it was n’t easy . Even after all these months , he and Elsa were still trying to settle in to the daddy - doesn’t - live - here - anymore routine . And he ’d never say this out loud but Elsa did not exactly crave Lauren ’s company . His daughter was tight - lipped and brittle whenever his girlfriend was around . At eleven , she understood what Lauren and Mike were to one another , and she did n’t like it . Lauren had noticed it too , and it made everyone feel bad . So he ’d stopped including her in these pizza outings . And Lauren made herself scarce whenever he had Elsa overnight . Like last Thursday — Shelly had gone to see a specialist in Baltimore . They ’d told Elsa that Shelly was having a girls ’ night out with friends . But it was really some kind of biopsy . He had n’t told Lauren the truth , either . In the first place , Shelly had specifically asked him not to talk about her health with anyone . Lauren could keep a secret . But there was another reason he had n’t told her . He felt superstitious about it . If he said “
20631	20759	20760	20760	Michael	2343	” then it would . The possibilities were too awful to contemplate . He hoped that in a year this would all just seem like a bump in the road . Maybe the doctors in Baltimore were about to give Shelly some good news . Somebody would . She was young and healthy . Uneasy , Mike sat there behind the wheel of his car , watching his ( former ) house for movement . But Elsa did n’t appear . Since he ’d rather not sit in his car all day , he got out and walked up to knock on the door . Knocking on his own door felt pretty weird , too . Shelly answered , but it took her a good long time . “
20762	20770	20760	20760	Michael	2343	” she said , her voice rough . “
20781	20782	20777	20777	I	91	” “
20788	20799	20800	20800	She	2199	” He leaned on the doorframe and looked past her . “
20805	20828	20800	20800	She	2199	” Shelly slowly shook her head , biting her lip . He was momentarily distracted by the fact that she looked exhausted . “
20853	20854	20844	20844	she	2199	” “
20857	20880	20881	20881	You	2343	” Elsa was always happy to see him . Shelly looked up the stairs , as if the answer lay up there . “
20889	21102	21103	21103	Elsa	2199	” Irritated now , he stalked past her and went upstairs , taking them two at a time . The familiarity of the carpet under his feet tugged at his gut . And his old house smelled the same — like Shelly ’s favorite hand soap . Every time he ’d taken a lengthy road trip with the team , coming back had been just a little weird . His family ’s lives happened out of his sight a great deal of the time . He ’d felt like an intruder sometimes . As he reached the second floor , the last stair tread squeaked . As it always had . Annoyance flared in his chest . Elsa could have spared him this awkward little trip down memory lane . His little girl ’s room was straight ahead , and he opened the door without knocking . Elsa sat cross - legged on the bed , a stuffed raccoon in her lap , her bony knees jutting out . Too thin , his subconscious prodded . And when he got a look at her face , his heart squeezed . She was awfully pale , with circles under her eyes . His anger died as quickly as ashes dampened in the rain . “
21105	21110	21111	21111	Sweetie	155	” he asked softly . “
21117	21132	21134	21134	me	91	” She looked up at him as if he ’d said something completely idiotic . “
21138	21139	21136	21136	Mom	461	” “
21147	21175	21176	21176	She	461	” He sat on the bed . Shelly was in the middle of her second chemotherapy regime . Her cancer had n’t responded to the first one . “
21183	21191	21176	21176	She	461	” Elsa said in a quavering voice . “
21195	21200	21176	21176	She	461	” he said softly . “
21221	21227	21228	21228	I	91	” Elsa shook her head . “
21235	21236	21228	21228	I	91	” “
21246	21256	21238	21238	we	829	” he tried , bringing out the big guns . “
21264	21278	21238	21238	we	829	” As he watched , her blue eyes slowly filled up with tears . “
21294	21333	21289	21289	We	829	” That was the precise moment he realized things were far worse than he thought . He pulled Elsa into his lap and she hugged him like he was a life preserver in the middle of the Atlantic . “
21343	21353	21289	21289	We	829	” he asked softly . She shook her head . “
21363	21364	21289	21289	We	829	” “
21375	21376	21377	21377	Tad	157	” “
21380	21384	21385	21385	He	157	” she said . “
21391	21392	21393	21393	He	157	” “
21402	21405	21393	21393	He	157	” Fuck . “
21412	21422	21423	21423	She	461	” he asked , hoping the answer was no . “
21440	21461	21428	21428	I	91	” Mike closed his eyes against a sudden burning sensation . He hated this for Elsa . All this fear . “
21510	21511	21481	21481	I	91	” “
21514	21518	21519	21519	I	91	” she said . “
21526	21527	21519	21519	I	91	” “
21530	21591	21519	21519	I	91	” he said , leaping at this idea . Anything to get Elsa feeling better . He wondered if he had any pancake mix left from the last time she stayed over with him . They could swing by the store . . . He stood up , lifting her against his chest as if she was still a preschooler . “
21602	21616	21597	21597	Daddy	533	” He ’d have to warn Lauren that they were on their way . “
21626	21632	21619	21619	You	831	” Her blue eyes begged . “
21641	21647	21648	21648	She	461	” I wo n’t either . “
21670	21681	21665	21665	I	91	” His heart sank all the way to the floor . “
21689	21693	21665	21665	I	91	” She nodded . “
21699	21700	21665	21665	I	91	” “
21705	21714	21665	21665	I	91	” He set Elsa down on her feet . “
21736	22015	21727	21727	I	91	” • • • He did n’t get to dine with Lauren that night . Pancakes and bacon were made and consumed . Shelly choked down a pancake with obvious difficulty . But she did it for Elsa . Then she quickly opened a kitchen window , and cold air filled the kitchen . She and Elsa pulled on sweaters which were already stashed on the backs of their dining chairs . When he gave Shelly a curious glance , she mumbled that the smell of food cooking was something she could n’t really tolerate lately . Mike wondered what Elsa had been eating , then . The answer was revealed when he opened the freezer to find stacks of frozen kids ’ meals . Unease coated his gut . Shelly had always prided herself on making everything from scratch . No wonder Elsa was terrified . Food from a box was the equivalent of Armageddon in this house . That night he put his little girl to bed the way he ’d done a million times . Well , not a million . He traveled too much for that . But it felt good to tuck her in knowing that he ’d eased her mind a little . His child was suffering . In all her eleven years , he ’d never seen her so scared . Not even when she broke her arm and had to have surgery to repair the break . Mike kissed her forehead one more time and closed her bedroom door quietly . Shelly was waiting for him , sitting at the bottom of the steps . He sat down beside her . “
22018	22022	21727	21727	I	91	” he said . “
22025	22035	21727	21727	I	91	” She did n’t look him in the eye . “
22056	22057	22046	22046	You	91	” “
22062	22069	22046	22046	You	91	” And please make it good . “
22089	22090	22083	22083	yours	835	” “
22095	22122	22083	22083	yours	835	” For a split second his heart soared . He knew it weighed on Lauren to date a technically married man . Then reality kicked in . “
22129	22130	22083	22083	yours	835	” “
22140	22145	22137	22138	Johns Hopkins	159	” His spine tingled . “
22148	22149	22137	22138	Johns Hopkins	159	” “
22163	22164	22152	22153	Sloan Kettering	160	” “
22168	22169	22152	22153	Sloan Kettering	160	” “
22189	22196	22152	22153	Sloan Kettering	160	” He heard her swallow roughly . “
22200	22311	22312	22312	I	91	” His stomach dropped all the way to his shoes , and he almost asked her to repeat it . There ’s no way twelve could be right . How the fuck could that be right ? She sat very still beside him , not breathing . And he had a déjà vu moment . Twelve years ago they ’d had a different but equally terrifying conversation . I ’m pregnant , she ’d said at that time . He did n’t think there was anything as scary as that . He ’d been wrong . Now his throat closed up as it had done the other time , too . “
22317	22322	22323	22323	Me	91	” he croaked out . “
22327	22377	22323	22323	Me	91	” she whispered . His mind whirled , trying to adjust to what it might mean . What she ’d said was so big he knew he ’d need a couple days to get his head around it . He might be making a lot of pancakes this summer . “
22384	22389	22379	22379	Elsa	2199	” Shelly said suddenly . “
22392	22399	22379	22379	Elsa	2199	” he gasped , playing catchup . “
22402	22403	22379	22379	Elsa	2199	” “
22472	22530	22531	22531	I	91	” The tightness in his chest doubled down . Shelly ’s parents were jerks . They ’d shamed her for getting pregnant when she was a teenager and shamed her again for having an affair and getting divorced . Elsa did n’t like them all that well , either . His little girl ’s summer looked grim . “
22537	22574	22531	22531	I	91	” he said . But would he ? If he could n’t get Elsa to leave the house for pizza , she would n’t be bamboozled into a three week vacation , no matter how exciting . “
22580	22585	22575	22575	We	840	” Shelly said quietly . “
22591	22592	22575	22575	We	840	” “
22595	23056	23057	23057	God	114	” he said , hearing in her voice that he was dismissed . He stood up , spotting his car out the front door , waiting at the curb . When he ’d parked it there a few hours earlier , things in his life were completely different . He left Shelly alone there in her quiet house , grateful to escape to his , where Lauren was asleep on her back , a book open on her chest . She ’d been trying to wait up for him . He climbed into bed beside her , carefully removing the book and shutting off the light . He stretched an arm toward her sleeping body . But something made his hand pause just over her arm . All he had to do was roll closer and hold her . She would wake to his kisses , and sink into his embrace . They could make slow , sleepy love to each other , and he could leave the day ’s troubles behind . Afterward , he could tell Lauren all his problems . They would all come pouring out , every terrifying fear he had for the future . She would listen like the true partner that she was . Hell — she might even fire up a spreadsheet to try to find some answers . Instead , he recalled his hand , letting her sleep . Something stopped him from going there . It was the bone - deep suspicion that this was all his fault . That hubris had finally done him in . Waking Lauren to hear his nightmare suddenly felt like a colossally selfish thing to do . Instead , he watched the woman he loved as she slept . Lauren had plans to look at apartments in the city . Soon . If he opened her laptop right now he ’d probably find it open to the New York Times real estate search engine . The woman he loved needed him to move away to a new life in the city . The woman he ’d married needed his help on Long Island . And the little girl who called him Daddy was hurting so badly . He ’d made different kinds of promises to all of them . As he blinked into the darkness , it became perfectly clear that he could n’t get through the next few months without breaking some promises . Maybe breaking some hearts . Lauren could n’t fix it for him . And maybe he did n’t deserve to have her try . He lay awake listening to Lauren ’s gentle breaths , feeling his happiness slip away into the cool springtime night . EIGHT WASHINGTON , D.C. APRIL 2016 “
23065	23182	23057	23057	God	114	” Lauren muttered to herself . Watching game number five was like revisiting her old life . It did n’t matter that she was n’t supposed to care anymore . It did n’t matter that she ’d given up hockey . The stadium thrummed with energy . The thwack of the puck flying off a stick and the crash of skates into the boards was the soundtrack of her whole life . And not just the parts she ’d shared with Mike Beacon . Hockey slang had been a part of Lauren ’s vocabulary since she learned to talk . If milk spilled from her sippy cup onto the kitchen table , her father would grab a “
23184	23205	23057	23057	God	114	” to wipe it up . If he and her mother bumped each other in the kitchen , it was a “
23209	23369	23057	23057	God	114	” Her grandfather had played for Long Island in the seventies . When she was born , her father was a veteran player for Detroit . When he retired , they moved to Long Island where her father became a manager — and then the manager — of the Long Island team . The sport was in her blood . Becoming a hockey fan was n’t a choice . It was her destiny . But that all changed two years ago . First came the new job in Manhattan . She loved it , but it was the first time in her adult life she worked with people who did n’t follow hockey . And then Mike had begun acting strangely . As she tried to narrow down their apartment hunting options , he grew distant . His ex - wife seemed to be leaning on him for a lot of childcare as the hockey season ended , too . “
23374	23469	23470	23470	Lauren	114	” Lauren kept asking him . He shook his head , looking troubled . A few months shy of her thirtieth birthday , she was riding home on the Long Island Railroad from a day of training at Nate Kattenberger ’s corporate headquarters when her phone rang . A picture flashed onto the screen to identify the caller . She ’d just gotten her first Katt Phone the week before , and had chosen this shot for Mike . He was smiling at the camera , a cupcake she ’d baked in his hand . “
23472	23486	23470	23470	Lauren	114	” His voice was a dry scrape into the phone when she answered . “
23507	23523	23497	23497	I	91	” There was a silence , and Lauren wondered if the call had been dropped . “
23529	23534	23524	23524	I	91	” he said roughly . “
23544	23555	23556	23556	Baby	163	” A chill broke out across her neck and shoulders . “
23562	23563	23564	23564	I	91	” “
23568	23574	23564	23564	I	91	” She held her breath . “
23584	23585	23564	23564	I	91	” “
23588	23613	23564	23564	I	91	” She replayed the sentence again in her head , but it did n’t make sense . He could n’t mean his old house . “
23616	23620	23564	23564	I	91	” he rasped . “
23649	23650	23651	23651	They	844	” “
23657	23662	23663	23663	Mike	2343	” she asked stupidly . “
23684	23685	23682	23682	you	842	” “
23688	23693	23682	23682	you	842	” he said haltingly . “
23704	23705	23706	23706	She	2023	” “
23710	23717	23706	23706	She	2023	” Lauren parroted like an idiot . “
23732	23733	23726	23726	Elsa	2199	” “
23736	23773	23774	23774	I	91	” Oh . That ’s when it started to sink in . This phone call was n’t just some kind of crazy misunderstanding . He was serious . And he ’d said he was leaving her . “
23778	23782	23774	23774	I	91	” he whispered . “
23798	23799	23800	23800	You	842	” “
23806	23810	23800	23800	You	842	” she argued . “
23819	23841	23842	23842	I	91	” His recent silences when she wanted to discuss apartment - hunting suddenly made a hell of a lot more sense . “
23853	24109	23848	23848	I	91	” There was a click , and that was really it . Lauren was left sitting there on the LIRR , her phone still pressed to her cheek . She had been completely blindsided . Not only had that phone call meant a break - up , but it had also clinched Lauren ’s exit from the world of professional hockey . She no longer worked in the team ’s office . And after Mike dumped her , she stopped reading the sports section and she never set foot near a rink unless her boss required it . ( He usually had n’t , thankfully . ) For two years her relationship with hockey had been severed . Yet here she was again , watching game five of a play - offs series , in a posh corporate box beside her boss . And so tense she was practically crawling out of her skin . As she ’d done for games one through four , Lauren had begun the evening assuring herself that she did n’t care who won . But the red - blooded energy of eighteen thousand fans in one room was too much for even Lauren to resist . And much like games one through four , by the third period she held her water bottle with a white - knuckled grip , completely absorbed in the action down on the ice . She ’d forgotten how this felt — the excitement thumping through her chest as the fans stomped their feet . “
24112	24201	23848	23848	I	91	” Nate stood up from his seat , along with eighteen thousand others , as forwards Beringer and Trevi raced down the ice , playing keep - away with the puck . Beringer passed , and Trevi took a shot . Lauren ’s heart leaped into her mouth . But it was just barely deflected by the D.C. goalie , damn it . Then Trevi was slammed into the boards by a defenseman , a blatant hit from behind . WHAT ? Lauren ’s inner hockey fan shrieked . “
24209	24386	23848	23848	I	91	” Her heart banged inside her chest as the third period ground on , the score a 2–2 tie . When there were only four minutes left in the game , everyone in the Bruisers ’ box braced as a Washington player charged the net . Lauren leaned forward in her seat as Beacon dove into position , deflecting the puck . Another D.C. player zoomed in for the rebound , and there was a scrum in front of the net — pads and skates and sticks all scrapping for control . Then an opposing player fell right onto Mike , knocking him down with such force that his shoulder unhooked the net from its peg into the ice . Lauren stopped breathing . The next few moments happened in slow motion . The offending player picked himself up off Beacon ’s body , which was n’t moving . Get up ! She commanded him silently . A whistle blew , and players and officials congregated . Mike ’s leg moved . But that was all . “
24392	24396	24397	24397	He	847	” Nate said . “
24419	24457	24458	24458	Lauren	114	” She processed her boss ’s words , but her gaze would not budge from the ice . All the adrenaline of the moment hit her like poison . Her stomach ached , and her head spun . “
24460	24466	24458	24458	Lauren	114	” Nate prodded her elbow . “
24469	24519	24521	24521	he	849	” She whipped her chin in his direction . It was his fault that she was sitting here , witnessing any of this . This was n’t her life anymore . Mike Beacon was n’t her cause , damn it ! Nathan made a calm gesture toward the ice . “
24524	24572	24573	24573	Nathan	91	” When Lauren looked down again , Mike was already putting a hand on the ice and pushing himself up . She did n’t relax until he shook himself and got to his feet . The linesman conferred with the ref , and a penalty was called . “
24575	24583	24573	24573	Nathan	91	” she demanded in a low voice . “
24589	24590	24586	24586	I	91	” “
24598	24603	24592	24593	the team	325	” he replied immediately . “
24617	24618	24592	24593	the team	325	” “
24626	24645	24619	24619	I	91	” she pointed out . Nathan raised an eyebrow , looking so smug she felt like strangling him . “
24658	24661	24619	24619	I	91	” Seriously ? “
24687	24708	24685	24685	Nathan	91	” His eyes went back to the surface of the ice , where the puck was in play once again . “
24725	24726	24685	24685	Nathan	91	” “
24732	24736	24737	24738	Your boy	852	” He snickered . “
24744	24745	24746	24746	He	852	” “
24752	25453	25454	25454	Michael	2343	” Nathan did n’t argue . His attention had already turned back to the team , which was enjoying a power play thanks to the penalty called against the player who took out Mike . With a shaking hand , Lauren took a deep pull of her water . I hate hockey , she reminded herself . And Mike Beacon is nothing to me . But the sight of his body lying still on the ice had made her feel cold inside . Damn him . And now she was eyeing the clock , wondering if the Bruisers could capitalize on the power play . Feeling the old pull . There were less than three minutes left , and they would decide her fate for the next two weeks . If the Bruisers scored , it was on to the conference semifinals in another city — another seven - game series . A hundred more chances to feel the weight of Mike Beacon ’s eyes on her in airport terminals , buses and hotel lobbies . Or . If they could n’t clinch the series tonight or in the next two games , it would all be over . A week from tonight she could be back at her desk in Manhattan , worrying about Nate ’s next international software trade show . Why did that sound disappointing all of a sudden ? She risked another glance at the rink , where Leo Trevi was making a new charge at the opponent ’s net . Defenders scrambled into place , but Trevi snapped the puck back to Castro , then evaded the player who tried to check him . Lauren went completely still inside . Then , with two minutes and forty - two seconds left on the clock , Trevi received the puck again , quickly passing backward to team captain O’Doul . Who flipped the biscuit into the basket . O’Doul ’s girlfriend , Ari , let out an earsplitting shriek of joy as the lantern lit behind D.C. ’s goalie . The stadium went nuts , some fans moaning and others hooting with victory . Lauren stared at the scoreboard as the goal became official . The Bruisers were a few cautious minutes away from going on to round two . Beside her , Nate rubbed his hands together . He did n’t yell or even smile because the game was n’t officially over yet . It was , though . Lauren knew in her gut that Brooklyn would advance . And she was stunned to realize she was a little thrilled by the idea . Nate and this team had worked so hard for two years to rebuild the franchise . Not that I care , Lauren reminded herself as the puck dropped on the next faceoff . Both teams skated with electric , sweaty energy as the clock wound down . With forty five seconds left , D.C. pulled its goalie . They needed a goal to push the game into overtime . They did n’t get it . Leo Trevi scored on the empty net , and then it was all over but the cryin ’ . When the buzzer sounded with its deafening glee , fans began streaming for the exits and pundits everywhere began speculating over who the Bruisers would meet in the second round . Lauren chugged her bottle of water and wondered how all this would end . • • • As the evening progressed , Lauren found it much easier to rustle up the proper amount of loathing for hockey . She stood for hours on weary feet at Nate ’s side as he took questions from journalists and conferred with Hugh Major , the general manager , over stats and predictions . During the play - offs , these sound bites and analysis — always Lauren ’s least favorite aspect of the game — were dialed up to eleven . Reporters were everywhere , nabbing players for a few words of commentary wherever they could find them . She found herself inspecting her manicure as Mike Beacon was interviewed a few feet away from her in the corridor . “
25469	25485	25454	25454	Michael	2343	” a sports reporter said into his own microphone , while a cameraman filmed them . “
25508	25523	25499	25499	your	2343	” Lauren knew him too well to miss the irritation in his answering chuckle . “
25575	25576	25698	25698	she	357	” “
25580	25589	25698	25698	she	357	” said the announcer with an uncomfortable laugh . “
25606	25687	25599	25599	they	853	” Lauren rolled her eyes . Hard . But then she caught Mike watching her . And when their gazes met , his lips twitched with amusement . Do you believe this guy ? his expression seemed to ask . She smiled before she remembered that they did n’t do this anymore . They were n’t each other ’s port in the shit storm of life . The moment was over anyway because her boss stepped up to ask her , “
25707	25708	25698	25698	she	357	” “
25712	25717	25709	25709	I	91	” Lauren told him . “
25743	25747	25719	25719	she	357	” Nate frowned . “
25752	25753	25754	25754	Your	854	” “
25758	25763	25754	25754	Your	854	” Lauren was confused . “
25767	25774	25775	25775	She	357	” He gave a curt nod . “
25796	25802	25803	25803	I	91	” More peaceful my ass . “
25809	25819	25822	25822	Nate	91	” she said , pulling out her Katt Phone . “
25833	25859	25827	25827	you	91	” If her life was up for discussion , he could take a poke or two . Fair was fair . Nate ’s eyes flared . “
25871	25872	25827	25827	you	91	” “
25877	25896	25827	25827	you	91	” she admitted . But why am I the only one who gets called out for ducking people ? “
25902	25916	25918	25918	her	357	” he began , as if her moment of disobedience had never happened , “
25945	25946	25949	25949	sir	91	” “
25951	25979	25949	25949	sir	91	” Lauren said a little too flippantly . She tapped the number for his mansion on her phone and listened to it ring while he walked away . “
25982	25992	25993	25993	Lauren	114	” Rebecca answered just as Lauren contemplated giving up . “
25995	25996	25993	25993	Lauren	114	” “
26007	26008	25999	25999	I	91	” “
26072	26073	26066	26066	I	91	” “
26080	26100	26066	26066	I	91	” Lauren did n’t make a point to start conversations with Becca . But she was dying of curiosity . “
26106	26110	26066	26066	I	91	” Becca groaned . “
26211	26263	26197	26198	the man	91	” He ’s in love with you , idiot . She could n’t say it , though . So she made a noncommittal noise instead . This was exactly why she never got chatty with Becca . It put her in an uncomfortable position every time Nate ’s behavior came up . “
26268	26272	26264	26264	I	91	” she said . “
26306	26310	26311	26311	He	91	” Becca sighed . “
26352	26353	26342	26344	one more doctor	870	” “
26359	26404	26342	26344	one more doctor	870	” Lauren said , sounding abrupt to her own ears . All the women in the Bruisers organization already thought she was a harpy . It was just that she became so freaking uncomfortable whenever she had to spend time anywhere near Mike Beacon . “
26407	26420	26422	26422	Nate	91	” Becca said , cheery even with a head injury . Figures . “
26427	26428	26429	26429	I	91	” “
26435	26643	26644	26644	I	91	” She hung up . Mercifully , the journalists seemed to have gotten their fill . So Lauren went to make sure that the travel team had already handled everyone ’s ground transportation . NINE Even though it was late , by the time the bus left the rink , the players wanted to celebrate . Instead of taking them back to the hotel , the team bus took them to a big , old - school tavern , with a gleaming copper bar and wood paneling . Lauren had been wearing heels and a suit for far too long , and socializing with the team was n’t her style . But it was raining , and there were no cabs in view on the street . She was starving , too . A little something to eat in a quiet corner of the bar would be a good idea . And she could regroup , and call herself a car . One of the players held the door open for Lauren , so she stepped inside . With typical macho bravado , the players trooped toward the back of the place , laughing and trading jokes about whose turn it was to buy the first round . “
26652	26656	26644	26644	I	91	” Nate said . “
26660	26667	26673	26673	boys	871	” O’Doul rubbed his hands together . “
26675	26863	26673	26673	boys	871	” Heads swiveled everywhere as bar patrons did the math on who this group of large , handsome besuited men might be . More than a few women slipped off their bar stools , drinks in hand , and followed the players toward the rear , like flies to honey . Lauren wondered whether any of them were on their way to chat up the blazing hot goalie whose dark , wavy hair was just visible in the scrum . Mike Beacon was a single man again , and at the top of his career . The women probably hurled themselves at him like moths at a porch light . Let ’s not think about that . She turned around , locating an empty booth in the very front of the restaurant . Perfect . She took a seat facing the street . Maybe she should even get her order to go — she would n’t want to be sitting here when the single players who ’d hooked up with a female fan made their way drunkenly into the night . A young waiter approached the table . “
26876	26883	26868	26868	I	91	” He set down a menu . “
26886	26890	26868	26868	I	91	” Lauren said . “
26915	26916	26912	26912	I	91	” “
26929	26930	26912	26912	I	91	” “
26941	26996	26997	26997	Lauren	114	” He gave her a friendly wink , slid the menu off the table and disappeared . Lauren pulled out society ’s universal disappearing device — her phone . She opened up the app she used for scheduling car service orders and noted that the average wait time was only four minutes . Perfect . “
26999	27015	26997	26997	Lauren	114	” She looked up to see Mike Beacon hesitating at the edge of her table . “
27021	27027	27028	27028	I	91	” Here we go again . “
27034	27035	27028	27028	I	91	” “
27038	27044	27045	27045	I	91	” He cleared his throat . “
27068	27137	27062	27062	I	91	” Evade , evade ! Her heart screamed . Last time they ’d had a conversation she ’d said too much , then spent thirty minutes in the bathroom crying . She sure did n’t want to repeat that performance . On the other hand , if she told him to fuck off right now , it would only prolong the drama . Damn you , Mike Beacon . “
27142	27181	27062	27062	I	91	” she said , regretting it already . How long did it take to whip up a Greek salad ? Ten minutes , tops . She could stay cheerful for that long , even if it killed her . “
27188	27189	27062	27062	I	91	” “
27193	27202	27062	27062	I	91	” he said , slipping into the booth . “
27213	27214	27215	27215	I	91	” “
27219	27243	27215	27215	I	91	” He studied her with big , dark eyes , their lashes so thick and long that they were wasted on a man . “
27246	27250	27215	27215	I	91	” he said . “
27262	27271	27255	27255	I	91	” Lauren waited for him to go on . “
27274	27285	27255	27255	I	91	” His fingertips did a fidgety dance on the tabletop . “
27296	27303	27255	27255	I	91	” His dark eyes checked hers . “
27347	27361	27363	27363	you	91	” The waiter chose that moment to show up with Lauren ’s soda . “
27365	27431	27363	27363	you	91	” she said quickly , taking the glass . She was thanking him for the interruption as much as for the soda . She had no idea what to say to Mike . She did feel like collateral damage . Even two years later , one glance at him made her remember how quickly her love had been thrown away . Like yesterday ’s trash . “
27447	27452	27456	27456	you	91	” the waiter asked . “
27458	27477	27456	27456	you	91	” When they were alone again , Mike reached across the table , covering her hand with his . “
27497	27523	27495	27495	Lo	1597	” She stared down at his hand where it covered hers . They used to touch like this all the time . Do not cry . “
27527	27531	27495	27495	Lo	1597	” I think . “
27560	27576	27549	27549	You	91	” She took her hand out from under his and put it in her lap . “
27580	27585	27577	27577	I	91	” he said softly . “
27640	27666	27633	27633	She	2199	” He stopped talking and Lauren made the mistake of raising her eyes . His were wet . He gave a quick sniff before continuing . “
27695	27776	27690	27690	I	91	” Lauren opened her mouth to argue but then slammed it closed again . She ’d spent a year arguing with him in her heart . We could have stayed on Long Island together . We could have worked something out . But if he ’d wanted that solution , he would have come up with it himself . His eyes softened in such a way that Lauren was a hundred percent sure that he could actually hear her thoughts . “
27806	27807	27801	27801	I	91	” “
27811	27820	27801	27801	I	91	” Her voice came out as a squeak . “
27832	27833	27822	27822	I	91	” “
27843	27851	27858	27858	Lo	1597	” Big , liquid eyes held hers . “
27871	27872	27866	27866	I	91	” “
27875	27894	27895	27895	I	91	” It was the one - word question she ’d held in her heart for far too long . “
27900	27909	27895	27895	I	91	” His gaze fell to the table top . “
27916	27924	27895	27895	I	91	” Heat climbed up Lauren ’s neck . “
27963	27981	27982	27982	I	91	” Hell , her voice had gone all high and crazy . She took a deep breath . “
28025	28029	28030	28030	I	91	” He cringed . “
28040	28045	28030	28030	I	91	” he said quickly . “
28058	28103	28104	28104	I	91	” Lauren took a deep breath and realized she actually was n’t going to cry . Because his apology helped . A lot . She ’d been waiting a long time to hear him say these things , and they shored her up inside . “
28114	28118	28119	28119	You	879	” he continued . “
28125	28139	28119	28119	You	879	” Loved me . Hell . She could n’t say that out loud . “
28153	28184	28185	28185	I	91	” She did n’t like admitting it . But the truth was she had n’t gotten close to anyone new in ages — not romantically , and not even friends . “
28191	28206	28189	28189	Lo	1597	” He put his elbows on the table and his head in his hands . “
28214	28215	28216	28216	Elsa	2199	” “
28220	28246	28216	28216	Elsa	2199	” she said , and then kicked herself for comforting him . That ’s not my job anymore , she reminded herself . He shrugged . “
28298	28333	28280	28280	she	2199	” Lauren chuckled , but she was suddenly so drained of energy . And the waiter set a little shopping bag down on the end of the table , then set down her check . “
28336	28343	28280	28280	she	2199	” She scrambled for her pocketbook . “
28346	28369	28370	28370	I	91	” she said , quickly laying some cash in the bill folder . It was time this evening came to an end . “
28376	28474	28475	28475	I	91	” Mike said . Please do n’t , Lauren begged silently . She had reached her emotional overload threshold already . But he followed her out onto the wet sidewalk . The rain had stopped , thank god . Whipping out her Katt Phone , a few taps found her an Uber driver who was just three minutes away . Mike looked up the shimmering street and sighed . Lauren followed his gaze , wondering what he saw . They were on one of D.C. ’s many grand streets , full of stone facades and wide sidewalks . “
28479	28499	28475	28475	I	91	” he said , turning to her . He reached up and touched her cheek with one calloused hand . “
28509	28510	28511	28511	Michael	171	” “
28513	28518	28511	28511	Michael	171	” she said sharply . “
28521	28522	28523	28523	You	887	” “
28531	28532	28523	28523	You	887	” “
28538	28677	28523	28523	You	887	” He looked down at her , and what she saw in his eyes stole her breath . His expression was achingly familiar — the same tractor beam of love that he used to show her all the time . She got trapped in that gaze , the same way she always had . She did n’t push him away as he got closer . Then his arms were around her and his face was buried in her hair . His hug was meltingly sweet , and Lauren bit her own lip just to stop herself from feeling any joy . He took a deep breath and pressed his lips to her cheek . If she turned her face , he would kiss her . Instead , she tucked her chin onto the shoulder of his suit jacket . “
28706	28723	28697	28697	you	888	” He pulled back , his ridiculously handsome cleft chin right in front of her nose . “
28765	28788	28756	28756	you	888	” Lauren held very still . They were still chest to chest , and the proximity was making her a little crazy . “
28798	28802	28756	28756	you	888	” she admitted . “
28807	28820	28756	28756	you	888	” He made a sound in his chest that she felt everywhere . “
28869	28870	28855	28855	I	91	” “
28873	28877	28878	28878	I	91	” He chuckled . “
28933	28934	28935	28935	I	91	” “
28942	28943	28935	28935	I	91	” “
28950	29050	29051	29051	I	91	” His joke broke the tension , so she tilted her chin up to meet his smiling eyes . And that ’s when he kissed her . It was a sneak attack . She was n’t ready for the soft lips that met hers , or the whiff of beer on his lips , or the masculine hand that cupped her face , angling her nearer . Mine , her body said , pressing closer . No ! Her brain tried to stomp out the brush fire that kiss had caused . She stepped backward to break the spell . “
29055	29089	29051	29051	I	91	” she gasped . That ’s when the door to the tavern swung open and Ari , the team massage therapist , and Georgia , the publicist , stepped out of the bar . “
29092	29110	29051	29051	I	91	” Ari said , her face becoming cautious , as if wondering if she was interrupting something . “
29113	29123	29124	29124	I	91	” Lauren took another healthy step away from Mike . “
29145	29150	29051	29051	I	91	” She looked around . “
29157	29173	29154	29154	I	91	” An SUV was waiting for the light at the other side of the intersection . “
29178	29222	29154	29154	I	91	” Georgia gave her a funny little smile , as if surprised at the offer . When the car stopped at the curb beside them , Mike opened the rear door and made a show of greeting the driver and looking him over . “
29229	29294	29154	29154	I	91	” he said , and Lauren wanted to roll her eyes . As if she did n’t use Uber at least once a day , in cities all over the world . Alone . Ari slid into the car first , followed by Georgia . Lauren avoided his gaze as she followed , but he squeezed her arm as she got into the car . “
29300	29301	29302	29302	I	91	” “
29305	29356	29302	29302	I	91	” He closed the car door , giving her a wistful look as it clicked shut . The car pulled away from the curb , and Lauren leaned back , feeling shell - shocked . Mike Beacon just kissed me , she said to herself . Did that really happen ? “
29360	29364	29302	29302	I	91	” she breathed . “
29373	29378	29365	29365	I	91	” Georgia said quietly . “
29381	29386	29387	29387	Patrick	92	” Lauren said quickly . “
29403	29407	29387	29387	Patrick	92	” Ari said . “
29411	29415	29387	29387	Patrick	92	” Lauren sighed . “
29419	29435	29387	29387	Patrick	92	” Perhaps the answer to that question was more complicated than Lauren used to think . “
29458	29459	29460	29460	Ouch	142	” “
29462	29466	29460	29460	Ouch	142	” Georgia said . “
29499	29500	29483	29483	He	92	” “
29504	29508	29509	29509	I	91	” Ari yelped . “
29524	29539	29516	29516	I	91	” Try two years . She still was n’t over him , damn it . “
29568	29597	29558	29558	I	91	” Ari and Georgia were both staring at her with undisguised fascination . Then again , this was more talking than she ’d ever done to these two . “
29608	29612	29606	29606	yours	901	” Georgia blinked . “
29647	29648	29637	29637	I	91	” “
29652	29661	29662	29662	Nate	91	” Ari asked . Georgia made a face . “
29676	29677	29672	29674	Some Florida billionaire	904	” “
29681	29685	29686	29686	She	904	” Lauren volunteered . “
29700	29701	29686	29686	She	904	” “
29704	29708	29709	29709	They	906	” Georgia agreed . “
29810	29811	29799	29801	a hockey team	911	” “
29818	29822	29823	29823	Nate	91	” Ari said . “
29846	29847	29848	29848	You	913	” “
29856	29861	29848	29848	You	913	” Lauren put in . “
29881	29885	29886	29886	You	913	” Ari smiled . “
29899	29900	29890	29890	Lauren	114	” “
29943	29944	29935	29935	you	913	” “
29947	29952	29935	29935	you	913	” Georgia said slowly . “
29965	29977	29978	29978	I	91	” Lauren smiled for the first time in hours and hours . “
30024	30030	30018	30019	My boyfriend	918	” Ari snapped her fingers . “
30064	30071	30072	30072	I	91	” This surprised Lauren a lot . “
30086	30087	30088	30088	I	91	” “
30110	30114	30108	30108	Beak	128	” Georgia said . “
30126	30127	30108	30108	Beak	128	” “
30187	30188	30189	30189	Yikes	175	” “
30191	30196	30189	30189	Yikes	175	” said Georgia softly . “
30207	30313	30197	30197	I	91	” The worst part about that awful time was n’t the bitchy looks in the grocery store , though . It was her own anger . She ’d hated Mike for leaving . And she ’d been angry at Shelly for using an illness to claw back the man she ’d cheated on . That ’s how it had looked , anyway . And then , when Lauren figured out that Shelly was actually dying , it only made her feel guilty . Horribly guilty . The car pulled up in front of the hotel , and both Georgia and Ari reached for their pocketbooks . “
30320	30321	30197	30197	I	91	” “
30326	30327	30323	30323	you	925	” “
30349	30382	30385	30385	I	91	” She could hardly believe how much personal stuff she ’d just spewed at these two . They probably thought she was twice as crazy now that they knew the real story . “
30393	30403	30385	30385	I	91	” Ari said , holding the car door open . “
30409	30422	30404	30404	I	91	” Lauren said . She was used to handling things by herself . “
30451	30458	30442	30442	You	925	” she pointed out to Ari . “
30464	30493	30459	30459	You	925	” Ari looked shocked at the suggestion , reminding Lauren just how unfriendly she ’d been up until now . Yay . Something else to feel guilty about . “
30511	30518	30502	30502	I	91	” Ari said with a smile . “
30540	30550	30528	30528	I	91	” The three of them entered the hotel lobby . “
30568	30572	30528	30528	I	91	” Lauren offered . “
30578	30585	30528	30528	I	91	” Ari pushed the elevator button . “
30612	30613	30614	30614	I	91	” “
30620	30641	30642	30642	I	91	” Lauren promised as the elevator doors opened . It would be easy . Ari would look smashing in anything . “
30647	30660	30642	30642	I	91	” Lauren ’s was the first stop , on the fourth floor . “
30666	30679	30664	30664	girls	932	” she said as cheerfully as an emotionally exhausted person could manage . “
30689	30813	30814	30814	You	925	” She heard laughter as the elevator doors closed again . TEN BROOKLYN , NEW YORK APRIL 2016 The next morning at ten thirty , Mike keyed in the security code on the door of his brownstone and walked inside . He tossed his duffel bag onto the floor and kicked off his shoes . Then he listened . Violins — two of them . Elsa and Hans were practicing . The piece was something fun and fast , with one violin chasing the other one around the melody . The effect was like two chattering squirrels zipping around a tree . He just stood there in the entryway to his own home for several minutes , listening until the piece broke down . “
30819	30826	30814	30814	You	925	” Elsa said with a giggle . “
30831	30839	30814	30814	You	925	” Hans argued , his voice amused . “
30857	31278	31279	31279	Hans	120	” The music started up again , and he walked slowly through the house . He ’d overpaid for this place , but it was gorgeous . The Wall Street couple who ’d sold it to him had done a modern renovation down to the studs . They ’d opened up the rooms to make a clean and bright space , with lots of natural light . It was ridiculously contemporary , though , with every surface painted either a shimmering white or an expensive shade of dove gray . The light fixtures resembled space age bird ’s nests . Or something . He could n’t quite decide what the hell they were supposed to be . He ’d paid a decorator to choose from all the furniture they owned and refinish and reupholster some of it to suit the space . She ’d done a good job warming the space up with honey - colored wood finishes and touches of color . He ’d probably been a dream client — checkbook open and no patience to sweat the details . Mike was still smiling as he climbed the stairs toward Elsa ’s room . The violins got louder . There was no greater moment in parenting than listening to your kid play Mozart or who - the - fuck - ever and laughing . They ’d had some really dark days these past couple of years . But a few things went right , the biggest one being Hans . It had originally been Shelly ’s idea to ask the violin teacher to move in with them . Hans was in his twenties — your basic starving artist . During the week he auditioned for orchestra gigs . On the weekends he ’d charged Long Island parents fifty - five bucks for a half hour of his time . Elsa had taken to him immediately , and he ’d been her teacher for years . There had been an awful month at the very end when Shelly was too sick to get any more chemo . The cancer spread to her lungs , and she was exhausted all the time . They knew she would die , they just did n’t know when . Mike spent all his free time either watching movies with Elsa — because it was less terrifying to ride out Shelly ’s last days when they were looking at a screen — or having frantic , whispered conversations about the future with his dying wife . “
31287	31293	31294	31294	He	524	” Shelly said one night . “
31323	31324	31313	31313	I	91	” “
31327	31349	31313	31313	I	91	” Mike had said , massaging his temples . Even one more loss in Elsa ’s life was one too many . “
31364	31388	31357	31357	He	524	” This was true . Shelly had hired him to hang out with Elsa during the final weeks of Mike ’s playing season . “
31391	31402	31357	31357	He	524	” Mike had said without thinking about it too hard . “
31412	31413	31404	31404	I	91	” “
31417	31558	31404	31404	I	91	” she ’d said . And the rest just fell into place . And when Mike had moved to Brooklyn last fall , Hans was all too happy to come along . He lived rent free in one of the most expensive cities in the world , and also got paid a weekly salary to be available when Elsa was n’t in school . Mike reached the doorway to his daughter ’s bedroom , where the music stand was set up . Big blond Hans towered over his daughter , but their body language as they finished their piece was eerily similar . After the last note rang out long and bright , Mike clapped from his spot against the doorjamb . Elsa whirled around and Hans jerked out of the way to avoid being poked by her violin bow . “
31563	31567	31568	31568	Daddy	533	” he said . “
31570	31586	31587	31587	You	533	” Elsa took a second to lay her instrument in its case on the bed . “
31591	31611	31612	31612	I	91	” She ran over and jumped on him , just like she used to do when she was little . “
31615	31643	31644	31644	I	91	” he said , catching almost a hundred pounds of Elsa in his arms and squeezing her . She looked taller than she had two days ago . “
31655	31665	31644	31644	I	91	” Elsa slid down to her feet , frowning . “
31675	31676	31644	31644	I	91	” “
31694	31695	31680	31680	Nate	91	” “
31699	31703	31680	31680	Nate	91	” Elsa complained . “
31722	31741	31715	31716	Nate Kattenberger	91	” Her face took on this slightly evil little smirk that Mike had privately titled the Teenager Smile . “
31789	31795	31796	31796	You	533	” He grinned at her . “
31812	31821	31822	31822	You	533	” Hans chuckled over his own violin case . “
31828	31841	31822	31822	You	533	” He picked up the instrument and slung it on his back . “
31857	31858	31848	31848	you	533	” “
31861	31865	31848	31848	you	533	” she argued . “
31870	31871	31848	31848	you	533	” “
31877	31885	31875	31875	Elsa	2199	” Mike said , disliking her tone . “
31888	31898	31875	31875	Elsa	2199	” Hans winked on his way out the door . “
31936	31947	31928	31928	I	91	” Mike followed Hans a few feet down the hallway . “
31975	31987	31988	31988	You	533	” Hans turned around slowly in front of his bedroom door . “
31998	32015	31996	31996	you	533	” he asked at a whisper . Mike could n’t hold back his laughter any longer . “
32018	32029	31996	31996	you	533	” he said making a shooing motion at the babysitter . “
32039	32050	31996	31996	you	533	” he only mouthed the last bit : get laid . “
32070	32071	31996	31996	you	533	” “
32088	32089	32081	32081	I	91	” “
32109	32128	32106	32106	your	533	” Hans disappeared into his room . It only took a few seconds until Mike heard him cursing . “
32133	32167	32106	32106	your	533	” Mike said with a chuckle . Tuesday was the middle school ’s performance of Cats . Since Elsa was in the orchestra , Hans would have to sit through the whole thing . “
32174	32182	32106	32106	your	533	” Hans called from within his room . “
32206	32207	32209	32209	you	533	” “
32216	32223	32226	32226	sweetie	124	” Elsa complained from her room . “
32228	32232	32226	32226	sweetie	124	” Hans returned . “
32237	32247	32226	32226	sweetie	124	” Mike called , heading back toward the stairs . “
32253	32254	32226	32226	sweetie	124	” “
32259	32263	32226	32226	sweetie	124	” Hans called . “
32282	32287	32292	32292	man	533	” Mike laughed again . “
32300	32301	32304	32304	him	533	” “
32307	32405	32304	32304	him	533	” Elsa yelled . Grinning , Mike headed toward his fancy chef ’s kitchen to scare up some food for his weird little family . • • • That night he and Elsa sat down to watch a movie together . Elsa queued up Amadeus and Mike filled a bowl with popcorn and Milk Duds tossed into it . Last week Mike had ordered Milk Duds from Amazon.com on his Katt Phone so he and Elsa could eat this comforting treat together . It had been Shelly ’s favorite , and he knew his little girl remembered . “
32411	32424	32407	32407	I	91	” Elsa asked when he sat down , the bowl between them . “
32443	32444	32435	32435	I	91	” “
32447	32457	32435	32435	I	91	” She stuck her hand in the popcorn bowl . “
32465	32471	32472	32472	Yippee	185	” Elsa pulled a face . “
32474	32475	32472	32472	Yippee	185	” “
32486	32503	32504	32504	She	947	” He ’d spent the plane ride back from D.C. catching up on all things Elsa . “
32517	32518	32510	32510	You	945	” “
32527	32548	32510	32510	You	945	” The other thing was even trickier . Mike leaned forward and pulled a FedEx envelope off the coffee table . “
32567	32624	32556	32556	I	91	” He pulled two sealed envelopes out of the big one . One was fat , as if crammed with several pages . Elsa was printed on the front in her mother ’s handwriting . The other was thin , and read Michael . His daughter picked each one up in turn , examining them carefully . “
32631	32640	32645	32645	lawyer	948	” she asked eventually , her voice shaky . “
32665	32666	32653	32653	He	948	” “
32670	32675	32653	32653	He	948	” Elsa repeated slowly . “
32683	32764	32680	32680	she	950	” Mike did n’t have a clue if Elsa was in the right frame of mind for this kind of bomb . There were days when Elsa was feeling much better , and other days when it seemed as if Shelly had died just a week ago , and everything was raw and hopeless . He ’d almost shoved these letters in a drawer to worry about later . But it seemed mean to withhold her mother ’s last gift . “
32772	32785	32765	32765	I	91	” she announced , flipping the Elsa envelope onto the coffee table . “
32788	32793	32765	32765	I	91	” he said quickly . “
32807	32808	32801	32801	me	91	” “
32811	32812	32801	32801	me	91	” “
32829	32830	32821	32821	I	91	” “
32834	32844	32845	32845	Yours	951	” She handed the Mike letter back to him . “
32849	32850	32845	32845	Yours	951	” “
32855	32985	32845	32845	Yours	951	” He shoved it into the FedEx envelope for now . He had no idea what Shelly wanted to say to him . While Elsa had been too terrified to acknowledge Shelly ’s imminent passing , he and his wife had already said their I ’m sorrys and good - byes . What was there left to say ? He was half afraid he ’d only find a note inside that read : Do n’t fuck this up . And was it awful that he ’d seen these envelopes and thought that it was just like Shelly to get the last word ? Whether Elsa was struggling with the contents of the letter , he could n’t tell . She pointed the remote at the TV and pressed Play . “
32992	33221	32845	32845	Yours	951	” • • • The movie was long and he found himself nodding off near the end . When his eyes fell closed , he drifted to the memory of the previous night . The win on the ice . And then the kiss on the sidewalk . He had n’t meant to kiss Lauren . But when he ’d held her in his arms it just felt right . He ’d never been as drawn to anyone on earth as he was to her . Hell . Hopefully she was n’t too upset with him for making her talk to him again . When the movie ended , he shut off the TV and followed Elsa upstairs , where they got ready for bed in their respective designer bathrooms . His was on the third floor . The master suite was the least lived - in part in the house . There was plenty of furniture , but no pictures on the walls and no personal touches . He had n’t turned the decorator loose on this floor , because nobody else ever saw it . After brushing his teeth , he jogged back down one flight to say good night to his girl . She was in her bed already , but poking at her phone , which she put down guiltily when he came in . “
33227	33238	32845	32845	Yours	951	” He sat down on the edge of the bed . “
33258	33259	33249	33249	we	952	“ “
33268	33269	33263	33263	I	91	” “
33273	33274	33263	33263	I	91	” “
33281	33303	33304	33304	I	91	” Elsa was still a little weirded out by living in the city . She often asked about locking the doors . “
33308	33309	33310	33310	Hans	120	” “
33317	33318	33310	33310	Hans	120	” “
33325	33330	33310	33310	Hans	120	” he said quickly . “
33347	33353	33360	33360	Dad	372	” Elsa rolled her eyes . “
33362	33418	33419	33419	Daddy	533	” Yikes . He did n’t know what to say about that , and not because Hans was gay . What were thirteen - year - olds ready to hear about sex ? He had no fucking clue . The fact that it was solely his job to successfully parent this child was beyond comprehension . “
33421	33422	33419	33419	Daddy	533	” “
33425	33426	33419	33419	Daddy	533	” “
33436	33437	33428	33428	you	533	” “
33444	33453	33454	33454	Hans	120	” Good answer , champ . Really eloquent . “
33484	33485	33472	33472	he	120	” “
33490	33500	33486	33486	I	91	” Elsa said , picking lint off her comforter . “
33524	33525	33515	33515	I	91	” “
33528	33534	33535	33535	Hans	120	” Hell . He might . “
33566	33567	33553	33553	You	959	” “
33570	33578	33553	33553	You	959	” Elsa said , looking put out . “
33587	33588	33553	33553	You	959	” “
33633	33634	33619	33631	two people who are pretty great . Who would want to leave us	960	” “
33637	33644	33619	33631	two people who are pretty great . Who would want to leave us	960	” She smiled up at him . “
33655	33656	33650	33650	I	91	” “
33659	33660	33650	33650	I	91	” “
33688	33689	33684	33684	her	114	” “
33692	33704	33684	33684	her	114	” Elsa made a face like she ’d tasted something bitter . “
33712	33717	33706	33706	I	91	” he said quietly . “
33746	33747	33748	33748	Becca	357	” “
33759	33776	33753	33753	I	91	” Mike took the sort of calming breath that one takes while speaking to a teenager . “
33841	33842	33837	33837	Lauren	114	” “
33850	33857	33837	33837	Lauren	114	” His blood pressure notched up . “
33860	33861	33837	33837	Lauren	114	” “
33890	33891	33892	33892	Elsa	2199	” “
33894	33950	33892	33892	Elsa	2199	” he snapped , cutting her off , because he could n’t stand to hear any more . Anger crackled through him , and he had to take another deep breath and remind himself that Elsa was only repeating what she ’d heard from the hockey wife with a mouth the size of Long Island . “
33957	33962	33954	33954	she	2199	” Elsa defended herself . “
33966	33969	33954	33954	she	2199	” Shit . “
33976	33985	33954	33954	she	2199	” he said as calmly as he could . “
34026	34033	34022	34022	Mom	461	” His daughter eyed him sulkily . “
34044	34082	34022	34022	Mom	461	” Mike closed his eyes and tried to think . He was n’t going to throw his dead wife under the bus on this one . And they were both responsible for their shitty marriage , anyway . “
34114	34132	34136	34136	Tad	157	” It actually took him a moment to come up with the name of the tennis instructor . “
34141	34142	34136	34136	Tad	157	” “
34150	34161	34136	34136	Tad	157	” He smiled suddenly . That makes two of us . “
34214	34218	34205	34205	she	114	” Elsa scowled . “
34223	34394	34205	34205	she	114	” That was the best he was going to get from her tonight . That was obvious . So he kissed her on the forehead and told her to sleep tight . Then he went up to bed alone , the way he always did . ELEVEN BAL HARBOUR , FLORIDA APRIL 2016 Lauren flew to Florida with an extra suitcase full of dresses and accessories . Not only had she promised Ari some wardrobe assistance , but she was having a fashion crisis of her own , too . Waiting at the baggage claim , she felt eyes on her back . When she turned around , Mike Beacon was watching her from across the room . Damn it . That was not what she needed . When she pulled her two suitcases off the carousel at the same time , a hand reached out to help her with one of them . She stiffened , but it was only Jimbo , the youngest member of the travel team . “
34405	34410	34402	34403	Miss Lauren	114	” he asked politely . “
34418	34419	34420	34420	I	91	” “
34426	34444	34420	34420	I	91	” he said helpfully , adding one of her bags to the rolling trolley he was assembling . “
34447	34697	34698	34698	Dad	372	” she said again , pulling the other one after her toward the door . She walked right past Mike , feeling his eyes following her out the door and into the Florida sunshine toward the bus . Hell , they were still at the airport and she already felt butterflies in her stomach . This party made her nervous . Really nervous . Not only would Mike be there , but the Atlantic coast of Florida had way too much history for her . There was no way to feel the sunshine on her face and ignore the ghosts of her own happiness swirling around her . On the bus , she busied herself with planning tasks for the next series of games . There would be two games in Tampa , followed by two games in Brooklyn . Only through constant alternation of host sites could home ice advantage be shared . The winner of the Stanley Cup would be the team who could perform at its peak for four best - of - seven series in a row . Play - offs season was exhausting . The end . Her phone rang . Checking it , she saw her father ’s face on the screen . Yikes . She and her dad were n’t close , and she did n’t often enjoy their phone calls . On the other hand , taking his call on the bus gave her a perfect reason to cut it short . “
34704	34710	34711	34712	Your mother	965	” He grunted an acknowledgment . “
34724	34769	34711	34712	Your mother	965	” No hello . No preamble . And Lauren knew beyond a doubt that family christenings were n’t usually her father ’s concerns . He only wanted gossip about the team that had fired him . And this was his subtle way of asking . “
34775	34780	34770	34770	I	91	” she said quietly . “
34800	34807	34809	34809	owner	974	” He made a disgusted noise . “
34842	34870	34839	34840	Fucking amateur	976	” Lauren rolled her eyes . Their relationship had never been great . And when Nate fired her father but promoted Lauren , it deteriorated even further . “
34879	34891	34871	34871	I	91	” Lauren said . She would n’t rise to the bait . “
34898	34902	34905	34905	your	977	” he asked . “
34919	34920	34909	34909	You	977	” “
34924	34953	34954	34954	I	91	” she said with false cheer . If he would n’t pay for NYU , he could at least buy her an overpriced meal for graduating from it . “
34967	34971	34972	34972	We	979	” she said . “
34980	35244	34972	34972	We	979	” It was n’t even a white lie . The sign for the Dorsal Club in Bal Harbour had swung into view . Her father managed a civil good - bye , and they hung up . Lauren got off the bus and eyed the sleek hotel . Under different circumstances , she would have enjoyed a trip to a luxury resort on the beach . But she and Mike had once been here together for the wedding of one of his teammates . They ’d stayed at the adjacent resort . It had been the most magical weekend of her entire life . The wedding was both elegant and fun . And afterward she and Mike had attacked one another in a partially secluded spot outdoors . It was risky and reckless . She ’d loved every second of it . But the memory loomed large . These were her thoughts as she stepped into the sleek lobby and marched toward the check - in desk . This place was top shelf . It had been designed to make guests feel as if they were at a nightclub . There were no wicker chairs or potted palms . This was moneyed Florida — the low pulse of house music played in the background , and long linen curtains billowed from the thirty foot ceilings . The trippy , oversized furniture was straight out of Alice in Wonderland . Lauren got her key as fast as she could and slunk off to the elevator bank without making eye contact with anyone except Nate . “
35258	35273	34972	34972	We	979	” she asked him as they both waited for the elevator doors to open . “
35281	35285	34972	34972	We	979	” he asked . “
35290	35294	34972	34972	We	979	” Lauren hedged . “
35313	35317	35303	35303	I	91	” He grinned . “
35337	35338	35328	35328	me	91	” “
35358	35359	35342	35342	I	91	” “
35365	35428	35429	35429	I	91	” Nate agreed , holding the elevator door open for her and then pushing his keycard into the slot so that the elevator would agree to open on the penthouse floor . They were both headed there . Wherever they traveled together around the globe , Nate always put Lauren in the room next to his , just to keep her handy . “
35460	35472	35451	35451	your	981	” Lauren puzzled over that for a second and then smiled . “
35479	35480	35451	35451	your	981	” “
35483	35488	35451	35451	your	981	” he said sheepishly . “
35494	35495	35451	35451	your	981	” “
35507	35508	35509	35510	Some people	983	” “
35521	35525	35509	35510	Some people	983	” He shrugged . “
35549	35550	35553	35553	Nate	91	” “
35555	35559	35553	35553	Nate	91	” Lauren laughed . “
35564	35614	35560	35560	I	91	” She did n’t even know why she said it . It just slipped out . Must be the stress of working for the Bruisers and that unsettling conversation with Mike the other night . He tilted his angular face in her direction and considered her with kind eyes . “
35630	35631	35560	35560	I	91	” “
35638	35658	35659	35659	I	91	” she argued , trying to get back to the joking place they ’d been in a minute ago . “
35672	35673	35674	35674	You	91	” “
35683	35684	35685	35685	Nate	91	” “
35687	35694	35685	35685	Nate	91	” she warned under her breath . “
35697	35711	35712	35712	I	91	” The elevator arrived on the penthouse floor and she followed Nate out . “
35719	35723	35712	35712	I	91	” Lauren proposed . “
35738	35852	35712	35712	I	91	” He paused mid - stride , and Lauren almost ran right into him . She braced herself for the words : mind your own business . Nate was famously nosy and famously tight - lipped about his own life . But if you ran a multibillion - dollar company you could behave that way , she supposed . But Nate did n’t say anything . He just kept walking like nothing had happened . They headed down a corridor with carpet so thick that their footsteps were noiseless . He went to the far end of the hall , where the plaque read Ambassador ’s Suite . Hers said : Princess Suite . “
35861	36162	36163	36163	I	91	” she called softly . He gave her a wink and then disappeared into his room . • • • The Princess Suite was too big for one lonely thirty - one - year - old . This one had a giant whirlpool tub at one end of a bathroom the size of a regulation hockey rink . The bed in the ocean - front bedroom was enormous , and piled high with white pillows of every conceivable size . There was a row of fluffy terry bathrobes — leopard print no less . And a vanity table that sat four . The living room had a table and chairs . This was where Lauren set herself up to work for the afternoon . But after a couple of hours she moved her laptop to a shapely leather sofa and sprawled on it . It ought to have been the perfect working environment . But it was so quiet she began to feel twitchy . She missed her desk in Manhattan and the watercooler gossip there . At Nate ’s software company she was n’t Lauren - who - Mike - ditched . She was just the efficient woman Nate trusted with his calendar , with his whole goddamn life really . She got up and did a lap around the hotel suite , taking time to give each of the dresses she ’d unpacked a shake to eliminate wrinkles . There had n’t been time to snap pictures and e - mail them to Ari , so she ’d just brought an armful . Now she had an idea . Lauren went back to her laptop and e - mailed Ari and Georgia , asking them if they wanted to swing by the suite for snacks and primping later . “
36201	36355	36193	36193	everyone	436	” A few minutes later both Ari and Georgia had responded that they ’d love to come up to the penthouse floor to get beautiful for the party . Well okay then . Now she had something else to plan . She ordered mini sandwiches and finger foods from a deli she located with her Katt Phone . She ordered beverages from room service — a bottle of white wine on ice , as well as a six pack of Diet Coke . At six o’clock she set everything out on the table . It looked like a lot more food than necessary . But she was so excited about not facing this awkward party alone that she ’d gone a little overboard . When the knock on the door came , she opened it to reveal Georgia and Ari , each carrying garment bags , and — to her surprise — Rebecca . “
36359	36372	36373	36373	I	91	” Lauren said , trying to keep the shock off her face . “
36383	36413	36373	36373	I	91	” she said to Nate ’s other assistant . If the Brooklyn Bruisers office manager was fully recovered , maybe Lauren would n’t be headed to Tampa after all ! “
36424	36428	36414	36414	I	91	” Becca said . “
36452	36468	36441	36444	My fancy new doctor	992	” She marched right over to the table and plucked a pickle off a tray . “
36509	36510	36499	36500	the therapist	993	” “
36513	36519	36499	36500	the therapist	993	” Lauren ’s heart dove . “
36542	36543	36537	36537	Somebody	154	” “
36548	36565	36537	36537	Somebody	154	” Georgia said , eyeing the munchies . She lifted the bottle from its ice bath . “
36577	36578	36537	36537	Somebody	154	” “
36589	36594	36537	36537	Somebody	154	” Lauren pointed out . “
36610	36611	36613	36616	a fan of parties	995	” “
36618	36622	36613	36616	a fan of parties	995	” Ari asked . “
36629	36630	36631	36631	I	91	” “
36639	36650	36631	36631	I	91	” Becca said wandering toward the windows facing the ocean . “
36657	36665	36631	36631	I	91	” She peeked into the ridiculous bathroom . “
36675	36676	36631	36631	I	91	” “
36683	36687	36631	36631	I	91	” Lauren agreed . “
36705	36709	36710	36710	You	991	” Becca snorted . “
36717	36718	36710	36710	You	991	” “
36720	36731	36732	36732	Frazzled	193	” was n’t really the word Lauren would have picked . “
36733	36740	36732	36732	Frazzled	193	” would be a better choice . “
36747	36760	36732	36732	Frazzled	193	” Georgia laid her garment bag over a sofa and unzipped it . “
36775	36786	36769	36769	I	91	” She pulled out a strapless dress in pale pink . “
36791	36795	36796	36796	I	91	” Lauren said . “
36811	36812	36796	36796	I	91	” “
36831	36832	36822	36822	I	91	” “
36839	36847	36822	36822	I	91	” Rebecca said , lining up wineglasses . “
36897	36937	36953	36953	Ari	150	” Yes , it is , Lauren privately agreed . It was in one of the hammocks strung between the palm trees that she and Mike had made frantic love that night . Yikes . Stop thinking about that . “
36940	36946	36953	36953	Ari	150	” she clapped her hands . “
36955	36963	36964	36964	Ari	150	” Georgia bit into a finger sandwich . “
36970	36971	36964	36964	Ari	150	” “
36975	36986	36987	36987	I	91	” Ari said , following Lauren over to the closet . “
36997	36998	36987	36987	I	91	” “
37005	37013	36987	36987	I	91	” Becca argued , pouring the wine . “
37036	37037	37028	37028	I	91	” “
37043	37047	37048	37048	I	91	” Lauren agreed . “
37061	37078	37048	37048	I	91	” A cheer rose up , because they were all sick of wearing the team color . “
37086	37106	37081	37081	you	1001	” She pulled out a dress with a gathered waist that would look pretty on Ari ’s yoga body . “
37117	37121	37113	37113	I	91	” Ari admitted . “
37130	37147	37113	37113	I	91	” Lauren set it aside . Maybe she ’d wear the red one tonight , then . “
37155	37165	37113	37113	I	91	” she said , pulling out a silver sheath . “
37187	37188	37113	37113	I	91	” “
37193	37197	37113	37113	I	91	” Ari laughed . “
37223	37238	37239	37239	I	91	” Lauren had to agree . She pulled out the next one and hesitated . “
37248	37249	37239	37239	I	91	” “
37252	37256	37239	37239	I	91	” Becca asked . “
37275	37290	37269	37269	your	1001	” Lauren held the dress up and tried to see it with unbiased eyes . “
37311	37312	37301	37301	I	91	” “
37315	37319	37301	37301	I	91	” Becca squeaked . “
37342	37343	37344	37344	He	2343	” “
37359	37375	37344	37344	He	2343	” she said , her eyes traveling the soft gathers of silk at the bosom . “
37400	37410	37395	37395	me	91	” Georgia laughed over the rim of her wineglass . “
37434	37438	37439	37439	Patrick	92	” Ari snorted . “
37446	37447	37439	37439	Patrick	92	” “
37450	37454	37439	37439	Patrick	92	” Georgia cackled . “
37466	37467	37461	37461	I	91	” “
37475	37479	37471	37471	Ari	150	” she dodged . “
37482	37491	37471	37471	Ari	150	” the publicist said , sipping her wine . “
37511	37536	37508	37509	a man	423	” Ari tried on a fit - and - flare dress that Lauren had brought in white with little black hearts all over it . “
37542	37551	37539	37539	you	91	” she asked , emerging from the bedroom . “
37554	37558	37539	37539	you	91	” Georgia said . “
37579	37586	37539	37539	you	91	” Ari turned in a circle . “
37593	37594	37539	37539	you	91	” “
37599	37607	37539	37539	you	91	” Lauren said , clasping her hands . “
37631	37635	37539	37539	you	91	” Becca giggled . “
37641	37650	37539	37539	you	91	” Lauren walked in a circle around Ari . “
37680	37681	37695	37695	She	1010	” “
37685	37689	37695	37695	She	1010	” Becca agreed . “
37704	37725	37695	37695	She	1010	” Ari smiled , moving over to admire herself in the bathroom doorway , where she could see the mirror . “
37740	37741	37733	37733	I	91	” “
37758	37759	37748	37748	Lending	195	” “
37766	37767	37768	37768	I	91	” “
37773	37785	37768	37768	I	91	” Lauren chose a sandwich for herself and began to relax . “
37793	37794	37791	37791	Rebecca	357	” “
37850	37851	37852	37852	Bummer	196	” “
37854	37858	37852	37852	Bummer	196	” Lauren sympathized . “
37863	37972	37852	37852	Bummer	196	” • • • Lauren had gotten a pedicure before leaving New York , so she did n’t need Becca ’s services . But facing a black - tie party with Mike Beacon in attendance required careful attention to the rest of her grooming . She curled and styled her hair while everyone else got painted . The constant chatter of female voices in her suite made her feel less lonely . Becca unveiled her dress , and it was so her — a strapless vintage dress from the 1950s . Rose - colored lace flowers covered white fabric , and a matching satin sash circled the waist . “
37975	37979	37980	37980	I	91	” Georgia said . “
37993	37994	37995	37995	I	91	” “
38000	38008	38009	38009	I	91	” Becca gave it a little shake . “
38046	38057	38041	38041	he	91	” She pulled out her phone and squinted at it . “
38080	38084	38087	38087	Nate	91	” Lauren laughed . “
38099	38100	38087	38087	Nate	91	” “
38110	38114	38087	38087	Nate	91	” Becca said . “
38142	38143	38137	38137	her	1013	” “
38146	38151	38152	38152	Nate	91	” Lauren said quickly . “
38181	38182	38167	38167	he	173	” “
38185	38189	38167	38167	he	173	” Becca sniffed . “
38225	38231	38233	38233	I	91	” Her friend turned around . “
38238	38239	38243	38244	baby doll	1016	” “
38259	38260	38254	38255	Auntie Becca	357	” “
38268	38280	38261	38261	You	91	” Georgia complained . But she handed over the mascara wand . “
38288	38303	38281	38281	I	91	” Becca cooed , tilting Georgia ’s chin so she could apply the mascara . “
38324	38325	38326	38326	I	91	” “
38332	38333	38326	38326	I	91	” “
38342	38387	38388	38388	I	91	” It was probably time to settle her own fashion crisis , so Lauren carried the blue dress into the bedroom where she donned a strapless bra . Then she shimmied into the blue dress , and the silk was cool against her skin . “
38393	38401	38388	38388	I	91	” Ari offered , hustling to help . “
38416	38422	38411	38411	you	91	” Lauren did the math . “
38427	38428	38411	38411	you	91	” “
38439	38451	38433	38433	Guys	1866	” Georgia and Becca stuck their heads through the bedroom doorway . “
38454	38461	38433	38433	Guys	1866	” Georgia said , while Becca made “
38465	38481	38433	38433	Guys	1866	” noises . Lauren went to stand in front of the full - length mirror . “
38485	38547	38433	38433	Guys	1866	” she said . But not for long . She put a hand over her flat stomach . If everything went according to plan , she would n’t be the same dress size in the fall . Now there was a wild , thrilling idea . It was almost exciting enough to get her through the next few hours . Almost . “
38555	38566	38433	38433	Guys	1866	” Ari said , appearing behind her in the mirror . “
38591	38595	38572	38572	Beak	128	” Lauren snickered . “
38624	38640	38620	38620	he	128	” she amended quickly . She skimmed her hands over her silk - clad hips . “
38659	38660	38661	38661	Men	562	” “
38668	38672	38661	38661	Men	562	” Georgia said . “
38679	38683	38661	38661	Men	562	” Becca asked . “
38703	38704	38693	38693	buddy	1021	” “
38708	38712	38693	38693	buddy	1021	” Lauren agreed . “
38743	38744	38730	38730	You	1021	” “
38759	38764	38745	38745	I	91	” Georgia pointed out . “
38778	38779	38745	38745	I	91	” “
38793	38797	38785	38785	you	1021	” Becca suggested . “
38815	38819	38808	38808	you	1021	” She grinned . “
38856	38857	38859	38859	your	1021	” “
38863	38881	38859	38859	your	1021	” Lauren ordered , happy to have the topic of conversation shift away from her own troubles . “
38892	38955	38859	38859	your	1021	” They zipped Becca into the vintage dress . The effect was completely different than Lauren ’s . They stood side - by - side in the mirror , a study in contrasts . Where Lauren was sleek and long , Becca was short and curvy . The sweetheart neckline was a good choice for her , as was the perky color . “
38961	38965	38958	38958	you	1021	” Georgia said . “
38975	39150	39151	39151	Lauren	114	” Lauren studied her reflection and considered the idea of a hook - up tonight . It was n’t really her style . But in her suitcase were the first doses of the fertility drug the doctor had prescribed . She was supposed to begin taking it in about a week . After that it would be game time — the clinic would inseminate her and she could be pregnant before the play - offs ended . If she wanted a final fling , the time was now . Although picking up a guy in a room full of her coworkers did n’t sound all that relaxing . She ’d have to see where the evening took her . And she still was n’t sure about the blue dress . The red one she ’d brought would look good , too . But Georgia needed the mirror , and they all admired her new pink sheath . They were in various states of makeup and hair - doing when someone knocked on the door . “
39153	39159	39151	39151	Lauren	114	” came Nate ’s voice . “
39163	39173	39151	39151	Lauren	114	” she called , setting down her round brush . “
39179	39183	39184	39184	We	1026	” Becca hollered . “
39189	39224	39184	39184	We	1026	” It was n’t remotely true , though , and so everyone laughed as Lauren walked over to the door and yanked it open . Nate stood there , bow tie in his hand . “
39228	39278	39279	39279	I	91	” she said . Looking a little shell - shocked , he took in the scene . Lauren watched his gaze travel around the suite , over their spread of food and wine and smiles . His eyes snagged on Rebecca , particularly her cleavage . Then he scowled . “
39301	39302	39303	39303	You	1027	” “
39310	39326	39303	39303	You	1027	” Becca crooned . She skipped over to take the tie out of his hand . “
39345	39350	39351	39351	I	91	” His cheekbones colored . “
39355	39366	39351	39351	I	91	” His gaze dropped to the glass in her hand . “
39376	39388	39389	39389	She	114	” Georgia stepped forward to take the glass from her hand . “
39403	39404	39410	39410	officer	1028	” “
39412	39416	39410	39410	officer	1028	” Becca said . “
39427	39546	39421	39421	I	91	” She held up the tie . Nate hesitated for just a second , and Lauren was probably the only one who noticed . She watched Nate do the math on how weird it would appear if he declined the help of one of his assistants only to request it from the other . So he took a step toward Rebecca , lifting his chin , and tried to appear disinterested . He looked about as disinterested as a Doberman in front of a rib eye . As Becca strung the tie around his collar , Ari and Georgia exchanged a loaded glance , proving that Lauren was n’t the only one who ’d noticed Nate ’s reaction . “
39554	39583	39585	39585	I	91	” Becca said , fussing with the tie . She was so much shorter than Nate that he had to stoop down a little to help her out . “
39599	39600	39585	39585	I	91	” “
39605	39613	39614	39614	Alex	173	” he said in a rough voice . “
39634	39635	39622	39622	She	1029	” “
39638	39652	39653	39653	I	91	” Becca said , tugging the two sides of the bow into place . “
39669	39678	39661	39661	They	1031	” Nate ’s scowl deepened to epic proportions . “
39688	39689	39693	39694	slave driver	1033	” “
39702	39715	39693	39694	slave driver	1033	” She danced over to her manicure toolbox and snapped it shut . “
39725	39735	39693	39694	slave driver	1033	” She tucked her case under a luggage rack . “
39739	39744	39693	39694	slave driver	1033	” Lauren said quickly . “
39748	39790	39693	39694	slave driver	1033	” Becca grabbed a tiny sparkly purse , slipped into a cute pair of red pumps , gave them all a wave and disappeared out the door with Nate . After it clicked shut , nobody said anything for a minute . “
39800	39804	39808	39808	her	1035	” Ari asked . “
39810	39811	39812	39812	I	91	” “
39822	39827	39828	39828	He	91	” Georgia said softly . “
39877	39914	39869	39869	Becca	357	” They were n’t false . But Lauren had been watching it all play out a lot longer than the other two , so she was both better informed and more annoyed at Nate ’s inaction . “
39934	39935	39869	39869	Becca	357	” “
39942	39946	39936	39937	Some people	983	” Ari said . “
39954	39955	39936	39937	Some people	983	” “
39964	39968	39969	39969	I	91	” Lauren countered . “
39998	39999	39990	39990	I	91	” “
40007	40026	40004	40004	he	91	” Georgia asked . Lauren fidgeted with her pocketbook and wondered if she was about to sound paranoid . “
40056	40057	40058	40058	He	1041	” “
40065	40070	40058	40058	He	1041	” Ari pointed out . “
40116	40124	40129	40129	Nate	91	” Georgia and Ari burst out laughing . “
40131	40135	40129	40129	Nate	91	” Georgia sputtered . “
40145	40149	40129	40129	Nate	91	” Ari suggested . “
40164	40165	40167	40167	he	91	” “
40183	40184	40175	40176	this party	1048	” “
40198	40203	40175	40176	this party	1048	” Georgia pointed out . “
40228	40229	40230	40230	I	91	” “
40239	40253	40234	40237	a cute basketball player	1051	” Lauren said , giving her hair a last look in the mirror . “
40280	40281	40282	40282	You	357	” “
40287	40330	40285	40285	girl	357	” Lauren found her wine on the coffee table and took a gulp for courage . Wine was another thing she might be giving up this year . Tonight she should live a little before the next chapter of her life began . “
40338	40342	40285	40285	girl	357	” Georgia prompted . “
40345	40552	40285	40285	girl	357	” Lauren helped the publicist choose accessories , and made small talk about Florida . It was nice having a couple of women to chat with . So much so that she forgot to reconsider the blue dress . TWELVE The first hour of the party was fun for Mike . His teammates enjoyed shaking hands with the basketball team , trading barbs and talking smack about which athletes were the toughest . Hockey players , of course . But everyone kept the ribbing friendly . It was a good party , but it would have been better if he was wearing shorts and a polo shirt . Standing around on the sand in a tuxedo was a little ridiculous . The women looked more comfortable in their summery dresses . Some of them held a drink in one hand and their shoes in the other . The ocean made for a pleasing soundtrack in the background . And the lights strung up on the palm trees made the place feel festive . Rich philanthropists circled the athletes , asking for autographs . He and O’Doul and Leo Trevi stood in a loose group with a couple of friendly basketball players and a handful of fans . “
40556	40560	40285	40285	girl	357	” Trevi teased . “
40568	40569	40285	40285	girl	357	” “
40577	40599	40285	40285	girl	357	” pointed out Ty , the basketball captain . He was a towering man with a shaved head and laughing eyes . “
40612	40616	40619	40620	college boy	1053	” Leo insisted . “
40622	40627	40619	40620	college boy	1053	” Patrick O’Toole chuckled . “
40633	40643	40644	40644	He	1055	” he said to the b - ball player . “
40650	40651	40644	40644	He	1055	” “
40656	40663	40644	40644	He	1055	” Leo said with a grin . “
40680	40688	40644	40644	He	1055	” Ty took a sip of beer . “
40716	40736	40739	40739	Connie	202	” Mike Beacon laughed , accidentally making eye contact with a cute redhead that was lingering near his elbow . “
40741	40750	40739	40739	Connie	202	” she said , holding out a hand . “
40755	40760	40763	40763	Mike	2343	” he said lightly . “
40765	40769	40763	40763	Mike	2343	” They shook . “
40776	40780	40770	40770	I	91	” she said . “
40800	40801	40793	40793	I	91	” “
40804	40818	40793	40793	I	91	” His bow tie felt a little too constricting all of a sudden . “
40828	40869	40793	40793	I	91	” It was n’t an eloquent line , but he did n’t ever know what to say when women hit on him . He was n’t on the market for a hookup , and had n’t been since high school . “
40881	40890	40870	40870	Tampa	38	” she said , shifting closer to him . “
40896	40897	40893	40894	punk Martell	204	” “
40900	40933	40893	40894	punk Martell	204	” He chuckled , because it was fun to talk hockey with a fan who actually watched the game . Maybe he ’d underestimated Carrie . Connie . Whatever her name was . “
40945	40946	40893	40894	punk Martell	204	” “
40981	40992	40975	40975	he	204	” Mike touched his beer bottle to Connie ’s wineglass . “
41016	41195	41006	41006	I	91	” She threw her head back and laughed , giving him a different view of her elegant throat . She had pink , kissable lips and clear blue eyes . And he did n’t give a damn . His eyes wandered off Connie and scanned the crowd . He thought he ’d spied Lauren earlier . She must be here somewhere . He really should n’t torture himself , but the sight of Lauren in an evening gown was not to be missed . And then he spotted the shine of her hair , and the graceful line of her neck . He drank in these little details one at a time , because glimpses were all he could have . There had once been a time when he could look across the room at her and think she ’s really mine . There was no better feeling than knowing they ’d go home together at the end of the night , climbing into bed for sex or conversation . Or both . He missed the whole package . “
41201	41208	41209	41209	He	1063	” Connie went on to say . “
41220	41221	41209	41209	He	1063	” “
41226	41405	41406	41406	Beak	128	” O’Doul asked , entering the conversation . Mike let his gaze wander again . Across the crowded area , a basketball player shifted to the side , giving him a better view . And — holy hell — he could n’t believe what he saw — Lauren wearing a blue dress . The blue dress . The one he ’d bought for her when they were dating . The conversation around him seemed to fade away while he watched her silk - clad body maneuver between two men in tuxes . His eyes were n’t fooling him , either . She was wearing the dress he ’d bought her on the weekend he ’d spent all day trying not to remember . But there it was — a column of silk the color of flower blossoms , clinging gently to the feminine shape of her body . It draped teasingly across the line of her bosom . She ’d worn it . Here , of all places . His throat constricted , and his chest got tight . “
41416	41429	41430	41430	You	1066	” Patrick O’Doul snapped his fingers in front of Mike ’s face . “
41433	41452	41430	41430	You	1066	” He looked up to see that Connie had wandered off , and O’Doul was staring at him . “
41456	41457	41430	41430	You	1066	” “
41463	41473	41475	41475	Lauren	114	” He shook his head like a waterlogged dog . “
41498	41508	41509	41509	Dude	1067	” O’Doul put a big hand on his shoulder . “
41518	41587	41509	41509	Dude	1067	” He spent a moment being surprised that the captain was n’t giving him shit for that kind of sentimental talk . But Doulie was a lucky man these days — in love with Ariana , and still in the honeymoon stage of the relationship where nothing is ever wrong . Lucky bastard . Once you ’d tasted the sweetness of it , you were never the same . “
41593	41598	41588	41588	You	1066	” O’Doul pointed out . “
41611	41683	41684	41684	You	1066	” He looked pointedly toward Connie who was now chatting up Silas . Maybe she really did have a thing for goalies . Slowly , he shook his head . This roped - off section of the beach was crammed full of attractive , moneyed people who could pay five hundred bucks to chat with athletes and their billionaire team owners . The women were all tanned and dressed to kill . “
41694	41699	41688	41688	I	91	” he told O’Doul . “
41772	41787	41761	41761	somebody	1052	” Unbidden , his eyes cycled back through the scene to find Lauren again . “
41790	41794	41795	41795	I	91	” O’Doul chuckled . “
41834	41835	41865	41865	she	150	” “
41842	41851	41865	41865	she	150	” He tore his gaze off his ex . “
41884	41885	41865	41865	she	150	” “
41893	41900	41865	41865	she	150	” Mike cuffed Doulie ’s shoulder . “
41936	41942	41931	41931	you	1073	” O’Doul stroked his chin . “
41960	41961	41931	41931	you	1073	” “
41970	41979	41980	41980	You	1073	” Leo Trevi asked , stepping between them . “
41995	41996	41997	41997	You	1073	” “
42003	42014	41999	42001	such a comedian	1075	” O’Doul grumbled while Leo laughed at his own joke . “
42021	42025	41999	42001	such a comedian	1075	” Mike sighed . “
42033	42042	41999	42001	such a comedian	1075	” He scanned the crowd again for Lauren . “
42050	42087	41999	42001	such a comedian	1075	” he said suddenly . If it was over , he would n’t still feel like this — as if just standing in the same zip code with Lauren had his body humming with newfound possibility . “
42093	42103	42104	42104	Beak	128	” Leo Trevi asked , sipping a fresh beer . “
42110	42114	42116	42116	he	128	” O’Doul explained . “
42124	42125	42116	42116	he	128	” “
42135	42141	42142	42142	I	91	” Leo said . Shit . “
42195	42196	42182	42182	I	91	” “
42212	42216	42182	42182	I	91	” Leo said . “
42225	42234	42182	42182	I	91	” Laughing , O’Doul high - fived him . “
42246	42247	42241	42241	Some	1080	” “
42261	42276	42259	42259	sweetheart	533	” Leo changed his tone in a hurry as Georgia sidled up to him . “
42285	42299	42281	42281	I	91	” Georgia asked , relieving Leo of his beer and taking a gulp . “
42325	42326	42259	42259	sweetheart	533	” “
42329	42337	42259	42259	sweetheart	533	” he said , kissing her jaw . “
42342	42343	42259	42259	sweetheart	533	” “
42363	42369	42259	42259	sweetheart	533	” She took another sip . “
42373	42389	42259	42259	sweetheart	533	” Leo cupped her elbow in his hand , guiding her toward the dance floor . “
42409	42639	42401	42401	I	91	” Mike watched the two of them slip away through the crowd . The rookie ’s eyes were locked on his fiancée ’s . Leo put up with a fair amount of friendly ribbing over how smitten he was with Georgia , and the kid took it like a champ . He knew he was lucky , and he did n’t care what people said . Mike and Lauren used to have what they had — that effortless connection . He wanted it back . Before he even knew what he was doing , Mike began weaving through the crowd toward Lauren . She was sipping a drink which could have been either a gin and tonic or a club soda with lime . And she was standing a discreet few feet from her boss , probably ready to step in and rescue him from anyone who tried to dominate his time . Whenever Mike was tempted to think that being a sports star was a drag , one look at Nathan and he knew he had it easy . People liked meeting hockey players , but they wanted things from Nate . He zeroed in on Lauren , where she leaned against the end of the bar . He must have worn his intensity right on his face because when she saw him approaching her eyes got big . “
42644	42666	42401	42401	I	91	” he said , stopping a foot away and folding his arms across his chest . Slowly she shook her head . “
42682	42839	42677	42678	That redhead	1085	” He smiled because she ’d noticed the redhead . That meant she ’d been watching him , too . He let his eyes drift down her body slowly . He ’d bought the dress on a whim . She ’d been trying on shoes in a store , and he ’d been eating an ice cream cone outside . The color caught his eye in a shop window . Somehow he just knew it would fit her . There was n’t any doubt in his mind . He ’d asked the startled women working there to wrap it up . His gaze dropped all the way down , then took a lingering path back up , past Lauren ’s hips , where his hands had once enjoyed skimming the fabric . Up to her breasts , just visible above the soft folds of the blue silk . He leaned forward and spoke into her ear . “
42847	42873	42677	42678	That redhead	1085	” He let his lips just brush the shell of her ear as he spoke . She shivered mightily . But then she sidestepped him . “
42883	43190	43191	43191	Rebecca	357	” she said , giving him a cutting look . Then she turned her back and marched away , toward the hotel lobby . He stood there watching her go . Every ounce of her anger toward him was deserved , but time was in short supply . He could n’t afford to just shrink back and wait for Lauren to realize there was a reason they could n’t stop watching each other from the opposite ends of a party . Finishing his beer , he tried to think what to do . He was done with this shindig , though . He ’d put in his time . Setting down his empty drink , he made his way past the pool where hotel guests were still splashing , even in the dark . When he spotted the check - in desk , he got an idea . THIRTEEN Storming into the ladies ’ room , Lauren did n’t know whether to laugh or scream . You summoned me , he ’d said . And , damn it , she had , even though it had n’t really been her intent . She was truly amazed that he ’d remembered the dress . Men were n’t supposed to remember these things . They were supposed to have hammock sex and then forget about it by cocktail hour the following day . And if Mike was the rare romantic who could never forget a big moment , then why had he treated her so carelessly ? For someone who supposedly still loved her , he had a funny way of showing it . Lauren was just standing there avoiding her reflection in the mirror when she heard a groan . A glance revealed the hem of an adorable fifties - style dress beneath one of the stalls . “
43197	43201	43202	43202	I	91	” she called . “
43207	43213	43202	43202	I	91	” came a wobbly voice . “
43219	43229	43230	43230	I	91	” The next groan sounded more frustrated than ill . “
43249	43250	43238	43238	I	91	” “
43256	43260	43238	43238	I	91	” Lauren guessed . “
43267	43268	43238	43238	I	91	” “
43274	43281	43282	43282	I	91	” The stall door opened slowly . “
43293	43298	43282	43282	I	91	” Becca wobbled out . “
43313	43314	43307	43307	I	91	” “
43321	43332	43315	43315	I	91	” Lauren said quickly . Becca ’s eyes grew damp . “
43345	43346	43338	43338	He	91	” “
43352	43364	43365	43365	He	91	” Lauren said , reaching over to take Becca ’s hand . “
43371	43372	43374	43374	he	91	” “
43391	43404	43385	43385	I	91	” She reached up with a free hand to rub her temple . “
43420	43421	43415	43415	I	91	” “
43427	43432	43415	43415	I	91	” Lauren said lightly . “
43438	43439	43415	43415	I	91	” “
43444	43454	43415	43415	I	91	” Becca said , a little sob escaping her . “
43463	43481	43415	43415	I	91	” Since this was such a nice hotel , there was an upholstered sofa near the door . “
43491	43492	43485	43485	I	91	” “
43507	43521	43499	43499	You	357	” Ugh . That only proved she ’d been a perfect bitch before . “
43532	43632	43633	43633	I	91	” She helped Rebecca to a seat and then slipped out of the powder room . Her return to the party was accomplished with stealth worthy of a James Bond movie . She did n’t want to catch Nate ’s eye , and she did n’t want to bump into Mike , either . But the shoes were quickly located when Nate ’s back was turned , and Mike was n’t visible anywhere . Twenty minutes later a dizzy Rebecca was safely tucked into her bed . First , Lauren waited while Becca changed into an amusingly skimpy nighty . “
43648	43662	43633	43633	I	91	” Becca glanced down at her lacy negligee and gave a wobbly shrug . “
43687	43688	43677	43677	my	91	” “
43708	43709	43697	43697	Nate	91	” “
43712	43718	43697	43697	Nate	91	” Becca burped . Whoops . “
43725	43734	43697	43697	Nate	91	” Lauren asked to cover her Freudian slip . “
43741	43742	43697	43697	Nate	91	” “
43766	43767	43758	43758	I	91	” “
43770	43781	43758	43758	I	91	” She fetched a glass of water from the bathroom . “
43793	43794	43758	43758	I	91	” “
43797	43801	43758	43758	I	91	” Becca groaned . “
43824	43825	43811	43811	I	91	” “
43830	43834	43835	43835	Nate	91	” Lauren asked . “
43841	43842	43845	43845	he	91	” “
43848	43875	43845	43845	he	91	” Becca used the furniture and then the wall to brace herself on her way to bed . She yanked the comforter down and climbed in . “
43891	43892	43889	43889	anyone	334	” “
43895	43899	43889	43889	anyone	334	” Lauren agreed . “
43924	43925	43889	43889	anyone	334	” “
43928	43937	43889	43889	anyone	334	” Becca said , facedown in her pillow . “
43942	44035	43889	43889	anyone	334	” Lauren tucked the key into her tiny purse and said good night . Then she had to ride the elevator back down to the lobby , because the hotel had two towers and she and Becca were staying on opposite sides . As the doors parted , she took a cautious glance into the lobby . Neither of the men she ’d been avoiding was present , so she walked quickly around the wacky , hallucinogenic furniture toward the other elevator bank . Where Nate was standing , wearing a frown . “
44041	44052	44053	44053	Rebecca	357	” he barked by way of a greeting . D’oh ! “
44057	44062	44053	44053	Rebecca	357	” Lauren said carefully . “
44077	44098	44071	44071	she	357	” That was all true , even if it was n’t all of the truth . Nate ’s eyes narrowed . “
44114	44115	44108	44108	She	357	” “
44120	44124	44125	44125	She	357	” Lauren hesitated . “
44158	44167	44169	44169	she	357	” Nate ran a hand through his hair . “
44179	44180	44181	44181	I	91	” “
44187	44199	44181	44181	I	91	” Lauren reminded him . He gave her a Nate smirk . “
44213	44214	44202	44202	Becca	357	” “
44225	44240	44222	44222	I	91	” He folded his arms and began to pace in front of the fountain . “
44243	44247	44222	44222	I	91	” Lauren yelped . “
44300	44306	44307	44307	I	91	” He glowered at her . “
44327	44335	44336	44336	You	357	” That ’s when Lauren lost it . “
44341	44350	44336	44336	You	357	” she gasped , her scowl matching his . “
44409	44491	44400	44400	I	91	” His eyes widened , and the color on his cheeks deepened . Lauren found herself in a stare - down with her boss . Even more startling — she won . Nate winced and looked away . Lauren did n’t even know why she was pushing him . It was none of her business , and Nate did n’t like to be pushed . Still , she shoved a hand into her clutch purse and pulled out a key card . “
44513	44540	44511	44511	you	1102	” He took a deep , yoga - worthy breath . Then he snatched the card out of her hand and shoved it into his pocket . “
44547	44551	44511	44511	you	1102	” Lauren added . “
44556	44561	44511	44511	you	1102	” His eyes dipped . “
44565	44628	44629	44629	She	1103	” Lauren stood there a moment longer , a little shocked that she ’d intervened in the Nate / Rebecca melodrama . But then she gathered her wits and left Nate alone , patting the pocket where the key was . She looked over her shoulder as she hit the button for the elevator that would take her to the Princess Suite . “
44635	44640	44641	44641	I	91	” she added quietly . “
44644	44783	44641	44641	I	91	” he said , his voice rough . Then he gave her a smile more sheepish than Nate was usually capable of making . Trippy . She rode the elevator up to the penthouse level alone . Maybe she should fill up the giant bathtub in the Princess Suite and soak in it . She deserved a decadent reward for flying to Miami and surviving a party where Mike Beacon wore a tux . Even though she was mad at him for intruding on the demilitarized zone she ’d tried to enforce between the two of them , it did n’t stop her from wishing she could remove his tuxedo shirt with her teeth and nuzzle his slightly furry chest with her nose . . . Lauren keyed into the suite and heard the sound of running water . “
44786	44965	44641	44641	I	91	” she called out . The room was softly lit and there was music playing in the background — a soft house music beat . Very Miami . The maid who performed the turndown service at this hotel was very thorough . But also tardy . It was way too late for housekeeping to be in her room . And where was her cart ? The water shut off , and Lauren kicked off her shoes , preparing to greet whoever was tidying up the bathroom . But the person who emerged was Mike Beacon . Startled , her brain tried to make sense of the picture . He had his tux jacket thrown over one arm , and a wine bucket in his hand . His bow tie was undone , and the top couple of shirt buttons , too . Lauren got a glimpse of the tan skin at his throat , and a dusting of chest hair below that . When he spotted her standing there by the door , he did a double take . “
44968	44979	44641	44641	I	91	” he said , his face breaking into a smile . “
44988	44989	44990	44990	My	91	” “
44993	45011	45012	45012	I	91	” Lauren snapped , since snappishness was her only weapon when they were in the same room . “
45024	45025	45012	45012	I	91	” “
45029	45037	45012	45012	I	91	” he said , his smile widening . “
45046	45056	45012	45012	I	91	” That ’s when Lauren ’s head almost exploded . “
45085	45144	45012	45012	I	91	” He moved , and she scooted away from the door to give him a wide berth . But instead of heading for the door , he walked into the bedroom . What the hell ? Stunned , Lauren just gaped at the open doorway . The sound of a cork popping was the next one she heard . “
45149	45198	45199	45199	Mike	2343	” he muttered . Mike reappeared , looking as handsome as he ever had in his life . But this time it only made her fingers itch to punch him . He trotted over to a cabinet against the wall and plucked two champagne flutes off a shelf . “
45201	45215	45218	45218	Lo	1597	” Lauren spat as he turned his back and headed into the bedroom . “
45220	45231	45218	45218	Lo	1597	” Her blood would probably boil over any second now . “
45251	45317	45218	45218	Lo	1597	” She stomped over to the bedroom doorway just to try to make sense of this odd scene . He sat calmly on the edge of the bed , bottle in hand , pouring a glass of champagne . It was Moet & Chandon . Our brand , her traitorous memory offered up . Lauren licked her lips unconsciously . She ’d always loved champagne . “
45325	45350	45351	45351	I	91	” he said quietly , holding it out . Although she had an urge to grab it and guzzle it down , she resisted . “
45385	45422	45423	45423	I	91	” His big brown eyes took measure of hers . He set the glass down on the bedside table and picked up the empty one , filling it slowly so that it would n’t bubble over . “
45428	45433	45423	45423	I	91	” he said quietly . “
45450	45482	45423	45423	I	91	” He set the second glass down and placed the bottle carefully into the ice bucket on the floor . When he straightened up again , he began unbuttoning his shirt . “
45539	45586	45535	45535	we	1111	” His face was dead serious , that handsome cleft chin pointing at her , waiting . Lauren stood in the doorway , feeling agitated . He made it sound so easy . She was still too angry to just go along with this little fantasy . “
45608	45646	45535	45535	we	1111	” He nodded slowly . Then he picked up both glasses and offered her one . She shook her head . Mike took a sip of one of them , then he closed his eyes in pleasure . “
45658	45667	45535	45535	we	1111	” he said , taking a second sip . “
45673	45674	45535	45535	we	1111	” “
45677	45705	45535	45535	we	1111	” she said , because twisting the knife was something she did often when he was around . He eyed her over the rim of the glass . “
45722	45800	45708	45708	I	91	” He took another sip of champagne , and she watched his throat work as he swallowed it , his Adam ’s apple bobbing . A dark dusting of stubble on his rugged jaw was visible even from this distance , and her traitorous mind wondered how rough it would feel under her hand . Lauren ’s mouth watered , and she was n’t sure if the cause was the wine , or the man drinking it . “
45814	45830	45806	45806	I	91	” he mused , admiring the tiny bubbles rising up the sides of his glass . “
45886	45910	45873	45873	I	91	” He patted the bed beside him . Her bed . In her private suite . How did he even get in here ? “
45917	45929	45873	45873	I	91	” she said through a throat constricted by anger and surprise . “
45949	45959	45943	45947	an angry , bitter person	1116	” His eyes flared with both heat and amusement . “
45976	46020	45966	45966	I	91	” She folded her arms in front of her chest , clasping her elbows to prevent her hands from shaking . Every nerve ending in her body was standing at attention . So this is what fight - or - flight feels like . “
46040	46055	46031	46031	Michael	2343	” Slowly , he shook his head , his glimmering eyes fixed on hers . “
46103	46123	46101	46101	us	1121	” He stood up suddenly , grabbing the other glass of champagne off the table and stepping toward her . “
46126	46133	46101	46101	us	1121	” He held out the glass . “
46153	46222	46223	46223	I	91	” Her mind reeling , Lauren grabbed the glass and took a much - needed sip . The bright taste of champagne burst across her tongue . Ten days from now she would probably be giving up wine on her obstetrician ’s orders . And giving up men was also a certainty . Last chance , her subconscious whispered . The bubbles tickled her throat as she swallowed . “
46230	46244	46223	46223	I	91	” she said , eyeing the attractive man standing in front of her . “
46267	46289	46290	46290	I	91	” It was tough talk . Except she left out the part about how she was still in love with him . “
46297	46301	46290	46290	I	91	” he whispered . “
46319	46397	46312	46312	we	1124	” He leaned forward and brushed his lips across her cheekbone . Lauren inhaled a deep breath scented with both his aftershave and the wine in her glass . She felt hyper - aware of everything happening , as if the moment were transpiring in slow motion . The rustle of his shirt fabric against her shoulder felt louder than it should have . And the warmth of his body leaning close to hers gave her goosebumps . “
46405	46428	46312	46312	we	1124	” she said , her voice low . She would n’t bother to pretend that she was n’t tempted . But still . “
46439	46440	46312	46312	we	1124	” “
46450	46472	46312	46312	we	1124	” He drained his glass and set it on the bedside table . Then he moved around to stand behind her . “
46488	46534	46483	46483	I	91	” She took another sip on command . So much for giving him a piece of her mind . A warm , calloused hand landed on her shoulder . With his other hand , Mike gathered her hair and smoothed it away from her neck . “
46543	46562	46535	46536	The guys	1881	” he said , his voice low and private , his thumb tracing the curve of her neck . “
46606	46670	46671	46671	Lo	1597	” Lauren closed her eyes and let herself be overwhelmed by the sensation of his hands on her body . Too many hours had been spent trying to remember how this felt . This man ’s loving touch had always made her pulse race . The drag of his fingers over her skin made her feel more alive than she had in months . “
46673	46683	46671	46671	Lo	1597	” he whispered , his breath at her ear . “
46690	46922	46671	46671	Lo	1597	” His lips landed at the juncture of her neck and shoulder , and she shivered . He began to drop teasing kisses on her sensitive skin , and she barely held in her gasp . As he continued this torture , her eyes stayed slammed shut , and her mouth hung open . When the backs of his fingers traced a slow line down the side of her dress , she bit her lip until she tasted blood . Thank God he was standing behind her , because she could n’t possibly keep the shock and lust off her face . He probably knew that , though . He was giving her a few minutes to get used to the idea . You could never outmaneuver a world - class competitor — not when he really wanted to win . As his nibbles became soft , open - mouthed kisses , Lauren ’s nipples grew tight . And when he pulled her earlobe into his mouth and sucked , she felt slickness gather between her legs . But she stayed silent , a death - grip on her champagne glass , until his fingertips snaked around the front of her body and began to tease her breasts . Even then , the sound she made was just a needy , breathy gasp . Hardly audible . His whole body stilled . “
46936	47048	47053	47053	Mike	2343	” he said . He tugged her backward with his hands at his hips until her ass was tucked against his legs , and his hard cock could be felt through the fabric of his tuxedo pants . The feel of it tightened her lungs and made her dizzy . Alarm bells went off in her heart . It was easy enough to just jump into bed with him . Lord knew she could use a night of naked fun . But not with him . Anyone but him . The hangover would be too much to bear . Sucking in a breath , she stumbled forward out of his grasp . “
47069	47070	47060	47060	I	91	” “
47079	47107	47108	47108	I	91	” She spun around and checked his face . It was flushed with arousal , but his expression was dead serious . Her heart gave a quiver . “
47136	47137	47138	47138	I	91	” “
47146	47160	47138	47138	I	91	” He shook his head and then ran a hand through his hair . “
47186	47187	47193	47193	you	2343	” “
47207	47220	47221	47221	Baby	163	” He walked over to the bed and perched on the edge . “
47248	47251	47252	47252	You	2343	” Seriously ? “
47263	47264	47252	47252	You	2343	” “
47269	47273	47267	47267	me	91	” he said . “
47282	47283	47267	47267	me	91	” “
47295	47306	47307	47307	I	91	” she said quietly . He looked up at her . “
47318	47392	47311	47311	I	91	” FOURTEEN Mike watched her expression from too many feet away . Her face was flushed with defiance . He did n’t know how to break through her anger , and there very , very few tools left in his arsenal . Charm had n’t worked yet . And his apology had only gotten him so far . Laying all of his cards on the table , he tried to make her understand . “
47406	47412	47311	47311	I	91	” She rolled her eyes . “
47433	47441	47428	47428	I	91	” Slowly , he shook his head . “
47449	47455	47428	47428	I	91	” Her disbelief was palpable . “
47463	47510	47428	47428	I	91	” Bracing a foot on the carpet , he leaned forward and snagged her hand , tugging her close to where he sat . As soon as she was in range , he put his cheek to her ribcage and wrapped his arms around her waist . “
47532	47549	47530	47530	you	1134	” Her body went still , but he could hear her heart pounding beneath his ear . “
47556	47570	47550	47550	You	1134	” she whispered . Tilting his chin upward , he found her gaze . “
47578	47579	47571	47571	I	91	” “
47584	47588	47589	47589	You	1134	” she stammered . “
47598	47604	47593	47594	Your wife	1134	” He shook his head . “
47625	47626	47622	47622	Elsa	2199	” “
47633	47642	47622	47622	Elsa	2199	” she whispered . Now she gets it . “
47701	47716	47717	47717	I	91	” Lauren ’s arms closed around his head , her fingers gripping him distractedly . “
47721	47722	47717	47717	I	91	” “
47727	47737	47717	47717	I	91	” His throat was rough but he cleared it . “
47783	47832	47833	47833	I	91	” Her fingers brushed through his hair , caressing his scalp , and he closed his eyes and tried to memorize the feel of her touch . She smelled of expensive perfume and sunshine . She smelled so fucking whole and alive that his eyes stung with happiness . “
47840	47844	47845	47845	I	91	” she said . “
47850	47872	47845	47845	I	91	” He made a grunt of acknowledgement , though it sounded like he was about to get the brush - off . “
47889	47890	47882	47882	I	91	” “
47903	47904	47882	47882	I	91	” “
47928	47929	47917	47917	me	91	” “
47934	47938	47917	47917	me	91	” she stammered . “
47957	48082	47945	47945	I	91	” She actually laughed , but he had n’t been joking . He was hard as a goalie stick and having her body in his arms was making him crazy . Without waiting for a response , he gently disengaged from her and stood up . He nabbed the bottle of champagne and their glasses , and carried them into the giant spa bathroom , where he started the water flowing . The lights were on a dimmer switch , so he lowered them to just a glow . Then he refilled both their glasses and stripped out of his clothes . He was already in the tub , sipping champagne , when Lauren came to stand in the doorway , still fully dressed . “
48091	48116	48087	48089	a total babe	1145	” he said , taking a casual sip . But his heart was thudding inside his chest . She gave him a tiny smile . “
48132	48133	48140	48140	sweetheart	1078	” “
48142	48158	48134	48134	You	1078	” No truer words were ever spoken . Lauren looked him over with gentle eyes . “
48174	48178	48165	48165	I	91	” He grinned . “
48190	48194	48165	48165	I	91	” she said . “
48202	48210	48213	48214	someone else	364	” His smile faded in a hurry . “
48216	48222	48213	48214	someone else	364	” She shook her head . “
48246	48247	48281	48281	Lo	1597	” “
48250	48277	48281	48281	Lo	1597	” He tried to imagine what that could mean . Maybe she was considering moving away from New York ? Now there was a ghastly thought . “
48297	48406	48292	48292	I	91	” Not that he ’d give up on her tomorrow . But a guy had to start somewhere . When Lauren ’s gaze perused his body , he knew victory was near . They ’d always had the kind of sexual chemistry that other people only dreamt about . He closed his eyes and relaxed against the slanted tub , inviting her gaze to linger . He heard the rustle of clothing , so he opened his eyes again . She ’d turned her back on him . But he made an involuntary grunt when he realized she ’d reached back to find the zipper of her dress . “
48412	48466	48292	48292	I	91	” he offered . Wordlessly she took a couple of steps backward until he could reach her with his free hand . She held the fabric taut while he lowered the zipper slowly . The dress began to fall away , leaving her in a tiny strapless bra and a white lace thong . “
48469	48473	48292	48292	I	91	” he muttered . “
48480	48481	48292	48292	I	91	” “
48489	48513	48292	48292	I	91	” she pointed out , stepping out of the dress . He groaned , his cock jumping below the surface of the water . “
48556	48557	48292	48292	I	91	” “
48562	48579	48292	48292	I	91	” she asked , hanging the dress on a hook on the back of the door . “
48583	48622	48292	48292	I	91	” She turned around suddenly , giving him the front view of a beautiful , shapely woman in tiny lingerie . Her tits spilled over the tops of that inadequate bra , and his mouth began to water . “
48631	48635	48292	48292	I	91	” she asked . “
48638	48642	48292	48292	I	91	” he managed . “
48647	48656	48292	48292	I	91	” she said , pointing at her own . “
48676	48677	48669	48669	I	91	” “
48682	48689	48669	48669	I	91	” His voice was like gravel . “
48696	48873	48669	48669	I	91	” Lauren crossed to the counter at the far end of the room and began removing her earrings . His gaze was affixed as tightly as a bumper sticker to her perfect ass and those long , shapely legs . It was hard to believe he was enjoying this view again . He would n’t take it for granted , that was for damn sure . When she bent over to zip the jewelry away in a case , he could n’t hold in a sharp intake of breath . Lifting her chin , she spied him in the mirror . Her serious expression suggested she knew exactly what effect she was having on him . Holding his gaze , she reached behind herself for the clasp of her bra . When it released , she dropped it onto the counter . Then she stared right at him in the mirror as she lifted two hands to cup her own breasts . Her thumbs circled her rosy nipples , and Mike heard himself grunt with longing . “
48877	48881	48669	48669	I	91	” he rasped . “
48889	48899	48669	48669	I	91	” Her smile was at once sweet and wicked . “
48906	48935	48669	48669	I	91	” Her eyes widened slightly , and pink stained her cheeks . They used to torture each other regularly , but tonight they were both out of practice . “
48939	49052	48669	48669	I	91	” he begged . She tweaked her own nipples , and then her lips parted softly and she let out a little mewl . He wanted to lurch out of the tub , cross the room and force his tongue into her mouth . But he stayed put in the tub , even as his hand slid onto his dick . Patience was a virtue , and all that . Lauren tipped her chin up toward the ceiling . Then she slid her hands down her soft skin until they reached the tiny strings holding her thong aloft . With a flick , she sent that scrap of clothing to the floor . “
49056	49073	48669	48669	I	91	” he growled as a tiny triangle of sandy - colored hair appeared between her legs . “
49076	49221	49224	49224	sweetheart	1078	” he added , softening his tone , if not his cock . He was so hard it hurt . Lauren raised her eyes to give him a hot look . Then — praise Jesus — she moved to the opposite end of the big tub and slipped a leg over the side , sinking into the water opposite him . Dainty feet nudged his aside , scouting for a place to rest . She slipped an elastic band off her wrist and wrapped her hair into a knot at the top of her head and then leaned back , exposing her neck as she made herself comfortable . Water droplets clung to the valley between her breasts , and he wanted to lick them off . Soon , he promised himself . Do n’t rush . Right . Tell that to his dick . “
49226	49233	49234	49234	I	91	” He passed her a wineglass . “
49241	49251	49234	49234	I	91	” She took the champagne and had a sip . “
49256	49257	49234	49234	I	91	” “
49261	49328	49329	49329	You	1078	” he growled , and she smiled . Mike lifted a hand to the panel on the wall and pushed the button that started up the jets . There was a rumble , and then the water began to course faster over his body . A warm current circled his groin , adding to the torture . He took her ankle in his hand and squeezed . “
49346	49418	49422	49422	sweetheart	1597	” She sipped her wine in silence , but the way she studied him was n’t quiet . He felt her gaze like a physical touch as it roamed his shoulders and dropped to his pecs . When she looked up again , he was waiting , and their eyes locked . Giving him a guilty little smile , she drained her glass and set it on the ledge beside them . “
49424	49432	49422	49422	sweetheart	1597	” He set down his own glass . “
49439	49727	49422	49422	sweetheart	1597	” Her eyes dipped , and he could almost taste her hesitation . But slowly she sat up until her perfect nipples emerged from the churning water . He quietly died five times over as she leaned forward , toward his end of the tub . Reaching for her slippery body , he tugged her onto his chest with a splash . They were nose to nose , her expression registering shock . Maybe she was surprised that they were finally naked together , or maybe she was only wondering whether that was his cock or a tire iron jabbing her in the belly . But he leaned in and kissed the question away — whatever it was . The first taste of her was like coming home . Their lips slipped sweetly together with the assistance of both steam and familiarity . A bolt of lust shot down his spine as he licked into her mouth . He slanted his head and tasted her as slowly as he could manage . He wanted to do this right . The first time they ’d ever touched was fast and frantic . He had n’t known how fragile their happiness was . Wiser now , he kissed her slowly and deeply . He would savor her . She deserved it . They both did . Lauren whimpered softly into his mouth . He let his hands trail slowly down her back . When he had both hands on her perfect little ass , it became difficult not to rush things . Pressing her slick body against his cock stirred something primal inside him . Mine , his next kiss said . He paused to take a calming breath . “
49730	49731	49422	49422	sweetheart	1597	” “
49735	49744	49422	49422	sweetheart	1597	” He brushed a thumb across her lips . “
49779	49973	49974	49974	Mike	214	” Under the water , he gave her bottom a slow caress , and felt her shiver in response . Then he captured her mouth in another eager kiss . She did n’t argue . In fact , she wrapped sleek arms around his neck and sucked on his tongue . They rocked against one another , and she rose up to tease him , grazing her clit over his cockhead . Jesus fuck . They ’d left all the awkwardness behind with their empty wineglasses . Things were escalating fast . Yet they had all night . Mike turned her in his lap , so that she was lying on her side . But he could still reach her mouth . Their kisses were bottomless , and the warm water caressed their naked skin everywhere . It gave him ideas . He clasped one of her silky knees in his hand and lifted . When he angled her body toward the jet , she gasped into their kiss . He did n’t touch her himself . He let the water tease and tease , while he took long pulls of her mouth . “
49976	49980	49981	49981	I	91	” she sobbed . “
49984	49991	49981	49981	I	91	” he whispered in her ear . “
50003	50004	49981	49981	I	91	” “
50012	50016	50005	50005	We	1156	” she gasped . “
50019	50038	50005	50005	We	1156	” he agreed . They used to go bare but maybe she was n’t on the pill anymore . “
50042	50238	50241	50241	Mike	214	” He pivoted , depositing her into the tub and freeing himself to step out of the water . He yanked a towel off the rack so that he would n’t flood the place in his haste , but he barely slapped it around himself before striding into the living room . The mini bar area on a cabinet shelf was quickly identified and ransacked . He found what he was looking for and tore the package open . God bless luxury hotels . He rolled the condom on then tossed his towel on the floor . Five seconds later he was pulling Lauren out of the tub , tossing another towel on the counter ledge in the bathroom and seating her on it . This was the fussiest bathroom he ’d ever seen . There were tufted stools for sitting at the counter , so he kicked one over in front of Lauren and sat on it . She was looking down at him , flushed everywhere from hot water and desire , her chest heaving . He pushed her knees apart , leaned forward and ran his tongue up the center of her . “
50243	50276	50241	50241	Mike	214	” she gasped , clenching his hair in her fists . He dropped kiss after wet kiss on her pussy as her speech became unintelligible . The only word he heard clearly was “
50279	50572	50241	50241	Mike	214	” The sound of it made his balls draw up with longing . He lifted his chin and kissed her belly . Then he pressed his face between her breasts and took a steadying breath . He ’d waited two years for this moment . It was hard to believe it had finally arrived . When he rose to his full height , their gazes locked . Kicking the stool away , he leaned his forehead against her smoother one as he took himself in hand . Then , finally , he pushed himself inside . She gasped as her body welcomed him home . Her arms pulled him close , her face tucked into the hollow of his neck . He rocked into her . Go slow , he reminded himself . Go slow . Go slow . He repeated it like a mantra . The problem was that he knew the pitfalls of going slow . Life did n’t wait . Death did n’t either . If Lauren gave him another chance , he was going to grab it with both hands and wrestle it into submission . And while Mike fought a losing battle with his patience , Lauren seemed to be fighting her own . Each of her breaths sounded shorter and more urgent . In the many mirrors he caught the motion of their coupling . The sight of her splayed knees , and her hands grasping his pumping ass — it was almost too much . He broke their kiss on a gasp , and took a deep breath . Do n’t rush , he coached himself . Make it last . Lauren looked up into his eyes , her face flushed , her pupils blown . “
50578	50582	50241	50241	Mike	214	” she whispered . “
50585	50595	50241	50241	Mike	214	” I love you so hard , it hurts . “
50609	50610	50241	50241	Mike	214	” “
50617	50669	50241	50241	Mike	214	” She wrapped her arms around his neck . Well then . He picked her up and staggered through the giant bathroom and into the bedroom . It was harder than it looked in porn . He set her down awkwardly , an inappropriate bark of laughter issuing from his chest . “
50682	50692	50693	50693	I	91	” she said , smiling against his bare chest . “
50699	50710	50693	50693	I	91	” he said , nudging her back onto the bed . “
50723	50749	50715	50715	I	91	” With her big , soft eyes holding his , she scooted backward onto the bed and lay down . He knelt between her legs . “
50754	50755	50715	50715	I	91	” “
50758	50779	50715	50715	I	91	” she said softly . He braced himself on either side of her body and sank down for a kiss . “
50783	50897	50715	50715	I	91	” He kissed her again before letting her answer , deeply this time . Her body went slack beneath him , and she made a happy noise . Soft hands reached for his hips . They came together again , like a finely tooled lock sliding into place . She gasped into his kisses as he worked her over slowly . Every thrust moved him closer to the edge of bliss . He was shaking with anticipation by the time she cried out for him . It was a sweet relief to let go then , chasing her over the edge , panting into her mouth , gasping as he burst with pleasure . “
50900	50909	50715	50715	I	91	” she breathed as they both came down . “
50917	50942	50715	50715	I	91	” he said , kissing her . They rested together , saying nothing that could n’t be said with hands and kisses and sighs . “
50948	50955	50956	50956	I	91	” she whispered at one point . “
50962	51100	50956	50956	I	91	” That was fine with him — for now , anyway . But sooner or later she was going to have to discuss their future . They had a future coming — he’d make sure of it . FIFTEEN Lauren slept very little that night . She and Mike would drift off together for a while , until one of them shifted and woke . In the privacy of darkness , hands would inevitably begin to caress and explore . Searching gave over to craving , until they found themselves locked in another sweaty embrace . She lost count of the orgasms before they finally fell asleep for good . A couple of short hours later , she awoke one final time to light creeping under the draperies , and the sensation of Mike kissing her neck . “
51103	51111	51112	51112	I	91	” he said , his voice hoarse . “
51130	51154	51118	51118	I	91	” She wished he would have , actually . Even though last night had been amazing , now things would only get awkward . “
51159	51178	51118	51118	I	91	” she said softly . He smoothed the hair away from her face , smiling down at her . “
51186	51187	51188	51188	You	1158	” “
51192	51197	51198	51198	I	91	” she said quickly . “
51208	51218	51198	51198	I	91	” It was as good a euphemism as any . “
51232	51244	51198	51198	I	91	” He traced the shape of her cheek with his thumb . “
51257	51258	51198	51198	I	91	” “
51262	51267	51198	51198	I	91	” she pointed out . “
51271	51274	51198	51198	I	91	in”—she checked the clock—“an
51291	51297	51278	51278	I	91	” He pulled a face . “
51327	51328	51278	51278	I	91	” “
51334	51339	51330	51330	we	1161	” she pointed out . “
51354	51360	51330	51330	we	1161	” He chewed his lip . “
51371	51380	51368	51368	I	91	” Or ever . She patted his hand . “
51395	51416	51419	51419	Lo	1597	” He leaned down and kissed her very thoroughly , his stubble abrading her lips in the best possible way . “
51425	51683	51419	51419	Lo	1597	” It was tempting to remind him that there were n’t going to be any repeats of last night ’s festivities . But since he wanted to keep things happy , now was n’t the right time to say that . He left , and she got slowly out of bed , feeling deliciously sore in all the right places . It had been a long time since she ’d felt this way — satisfied . Her sex life had been scant these past two years . She ’d been out on a few dates , every one of them inspired by either loneliness or the desire to prove to herself that she could be wanted . Ugh . It had been a crappy couple of years trying not to think about Mike Beacon . There was a small chance that last night ’s shenanigans could help stop the tide of pathetic thoughts . And anyway , she had a pregnancy to plan and a new chapter in her life to welcome . She went into the bathroom and stepped into the walk - in shower to wash her hair . She ’d really expected to feel more regret right now . Maybe it would hit later . It was true what they said about releasing sexual tension — she felt too loose right now to worry about much of anything . When she was nearly packed up and ready to roll , there came a tap on the door . Lauren opened it to reveal Georgia . “
51686	51691	51692	51692	I	91	” the publicist said . “
51716	51722	51707	51707	She	357	” Georgia raised an eyebrow . “
51735	51741	51742	51742	I	91	” Lauren had no clue . “
51767	51777	51783	51783	she	357	” She opened the door wider to admit Georgia . “
51791	51792	51793	51793	She	357	” “
51806	51807	51797	51797	I	91	” “
51815	51821	51809	51809	you	1163	” Georgia ’s eyebrows rose . “
51832	51833	51809	51809	you	1163	” “
51838	51884	51809	51809	you	1163	” Lauren scoffed . She grabbed Becca ’s case and set it near the door . Then she popped open her own pocketbook to leave a tip for the housekeeper . Georgia grabbed her garment bag off the desk chair and then seemed to freeze . “
51894	51895	51890	51890	you	1163	” “
51900	51917	51890	51890	you	1163	” Georgia looked up with sparkling eyes , then pointed at something on the cabinet shelf . “
51930	51998	51925	51925	You	1163	” Lauren crossed to the desk to discover . . . a hastily discarded condom package on its surface . She picked it up and crumpled it in her hand . It had been a three pack . There were none left . She dropped the evidence in an otherwise empty wastepaper basket . Then she raised her eyes to find Georgia ’s amused ones watching her . “
52003	52004	51925	51925	You	1163	” “
52023	52030	52015	52015	I	91	” Slowly she shook her head . “
52035	52036	52039	52039	his	1163	” “
52047	52048	52049	52049	Goalie	219	” “
52051	52056	52049	52049	Goalie	219	” Lauren said quietly . “
52059	52063	52049	52049	Goalie	219	” Georgia whispered . “
52066	52067	52049	52049	Goalie	219	” “
52081	52090	52091	52091	I	91	” Lauren clapped a hand over her mouth . “
52112	52113	52117	52117	he	1163	” “
52121	52122	52123	52123	I	91	” “
52127	52128	52123	52123	I	91	” “
52137	52150	52151	52151	Leo	533	” Georgia speculated as the two of them headed out the door . “
52172	52180	52165	52165	I	91	” Lauren gave a snort of laughter . “
52192	52336	52165	52165	I	91	” The two of them went downstairs , where the team milled around , looking hungover . At least Lauren was n’t the only one who ’d had a wild night . She kept close to Georgia and steered a wide berth around Mike Beacon . Though it was tempting to stare at him and relive the finer points of last night ’s sexcapades . Go ahead , she dared herself . The virtual replay was the only kind she was going to get . She boarded the bus when it arrived , taking the seat beside Georgia . Lauren pulled out her phone and began to deal with the day ’s e - mails . But the bus just sat there longer than it should have . Lauren looked up and waved over Jimbo , the youngest member of the operations team . “
52345	52368	52369	52369	We	1169	” He was handing out paper sacks containing muffins , and small cups of coffee , which she and Georgia accepted gratefully . “
52375	52379	52373	52373	Nate	91	” Jimbo said . “
52382	52460	52461	52461	Omigod	98	” The bus could n’t really leave without the owner . And the jet would wait for him as long as it took . She went back to her e - mail . From the back of the bus she heard Mike ’s laugh . Who knew what he was laughing at — probably one of Doulie ’s jokes . But the sound resonated inside her chest and made her feel fizzy inside . Georgia nudged her . “
52469	52500	52461	52461	Omigod	98	” Lauren craned her neck to see what Georgia meant . Outside , Nate was leaning into the back seat of a hired sedan with tinted windows . Way in . “
52503	52504	52505	52505	Becca	357	” “
52539	52579	52534	52534	her	357	” Lauren stared as Nate ’s back emerged from the car . He snapped the door shut with typical Nate efficiency , his face unreadable . Then he walked out of her line of sight to board the bus . “
52585	52593	52594	52594	I	91	” Georgia asked in an awed tone . “
52602	52639	52594	52594	I	91	” A moment later the doors to the bus closed and the breaks squeaked . The bus began to roll forward . As Nate slowly approached their seat , both Georgia and Lauren stared at him . “
52642	52651	52594	52594	I	91	” he said , giving them a frown . “
52657	52670	52671	52671	You	1172	” Lauren said , watching for a crack in his stern facade . “
52673	52689	52671	52671	You	1172	” He gave her a Nate frown and moved past , heading toward the back . “
52695	52699	52691	52691	I	91	” Georgia whispered . “
52702	52843	52691	52691	I	91	” Lauren agreed . She went back to work and tried not to listen for Mike ’s laugh among the others . • • • Forty - eight hours later , her phone pressed to her ear , Lauren listened to an endless stream of voice mails for Nate . Multitasking , she hustled into a hotel conference room where the team ’s lunch was set out . While one of Nate ’s tech officers droned on about their upcoming trip to China , she handed Jimbo a new itinerary for the next twenty - four hours . He scanned the page and gave her a salute , so Lauren walked over to hand the same information to Georgia and her partner in the publicity office — Tommy . Lauren put her phone away and greeted Georgia with an apology . “
52870	52871	52855	52857	the host team	1175	” “
52894	52902	52887	52887	they	1175	” Lauren had wondered that same thing . “
52923	52924	52915	52915	they	1175	” “
52928	52941	52915	52915	they	1175	” Leo Trevi teased , coming over to stand behind his fiancée . “
52960	52961	52915	52915	they	1175	” “
52971	52975	52962	52962	Someone	606	” Lauren guessed . “
52986	52996	52980	52980	We	1176	” He pulled out a chair next to Georgia . “
53015	53022	53009	53009	I	91	” Lauren held up a hand . “
53032	53084	53085	53085	Hi	220	” He grinned . She gave him a friendly wave and wandered off to check out the buffet . She was n’t hungry at all , but there was a decent - looking Caesar salad , so she grabbed a to - go container and forked some salad leaves into it . “
53088	53106	53085	53085	Hi	220	” a smoky voice said from just beside her . Mike had snuck up and ambushed her . “
53115	53135	53085	53085	Hi	220	” Oh , boy . Lauren stifled a laugh , even as her senses began to hum in unison . “
53138	53143	53085	53085	Hi	220	” she said lightly . “
53153	53154	53085	53085	Hi	220	” “
53165	53182	53085	53085	Hi	220	” Lauren just shook her head , smiling down at the croutons on the salad bar . “
53188	53192	53193	53193	I	91	” he asked . “
53198	53203	53195	53195	I	91	” she said quickly . “
53222	53223	53216	53216	Nate	91	” “
53228	53268	53216	53216	Nate	91	” he said , giving her a quick smile . And , damn , she ’d seen that smile in bed just two days ago . Suddenly the room was warmer than it had been a few minutes ago . “
53276	53280	53284	53284	you	1174	” he pressed . “
53311	53340	53299	53299	Coach	102	” She returned his smile , but then looked down at the buffet again , to try to shake off his sexual tractor beam . None of that . “
53356	53357	53350	53350	Coach	102	” “
53362	53431	53350	53350	Coach	102	” He added a couple of olives to his plate , which already overflowed with two sandwiches and pasta salad . She ’d always enjoyed watching him eat . The man burned so many calories during the season that he literally could not eat enough to maintain his weight . Cooking for him had always been gratifying . He ’d try anything , and he loved exotic flavors . “
53438	53455	53350	53350	Coach	102	” she ’d remarked once as he was tucking into a spicy paella she ’d made . “
53471	53472	53350	53350	Coach	102	” “
53483	53489	53480	53481	a specialist	1181	” he ’d quipped once . “
53494	53514	53490	53490	I	91	” Yikes . And here she was , falling into a memory . She snapped the takeout container closed . “
53523	53536	53515	53515	I	91	” she said , grabbing a roll to go with her salad . “
53542	53549	53515	53515	I	91	” he said under his breath . “
53562	53563	53515	53515	I	91	” “
53572	53577	53515	53515	I	91	” she reminded him . “
53582	53586	53515	53515	I	91	” He shrugged . “
53613	53668	53606	53606	I	91	” He grabbed a roll and shoved half of it into his mouth , smiling as he chewed . She rolled her eyes , and realized they were having an almost normal conversation . See ? This is possible , she noted . We can be friends and it ’s only sort of weird . “
53675	53679	53680	53680	I	91	” she said . “
53687	53699	53702	53702	Lo	1597	” She would , too . His face became more serious . “
53709	53710	53702	53702	Lo	1597	” “
53715	53798	53711	53711	You	1174	” Maybe most ex - couples did n’t even out their differences with a long night of sex . Then again , they were n’t like most ex - couples . And she was ready to put their differences behind her , and to breathe more easily when he was in the room . This was nice . It was almost healthy . He gave her a full - powered smile , and it only made her knees feel a little squishy . “
53806	54813	53711	53711	You	1174	” Whistling he carried his loaded plate off to a table full of players . Lauren carried her lunch out of the room and headed for the elevators . She probably could have spared twenty minutes . Nate was n’t expecting her yet . But if she and Mike were going to be friends , she had to get used to the idea , first . Their night together was still too raw . She kept flashing back to their hours in bed , and the feel of his lips against her own . Those sensations were bound to fade , though . And the second round of play - offs left very little time for mooning about . The players had been sequestered with the coaching staff since the moment they ’d touched down . Lauren was holed up in yet another hotel suite and went to work . She let herself back into the suite and dropped her lunch on the desk beside her laptop . She ’d fibbed to Mike about how soon Nate was expecting her . But she was busy . In fact , she ’d promised herself that while she ate lunch she would make a very important decision . Lauren flipped open the file folder of sperm donors and spread four sheets of paper out so that she could see them all . These were the last candidates — she’d narrowed it down to four . It was time to pick one and order the vials of — gulp — sperm to be delivered to her doctor ’s office . She ’d gotten her period this morning . That meant it was almost time to start taking the pills in her carry - on bag . And five days after that she ’d ovulate , and it would be time for the intrauterine insemination . She could be pregnant by one of the dudes described in front of her two weeks from now . It was time to choose between them . An engineer . Two law students . And a conservator of antiquities . Choosing the father of your baby as if you were perusing the J. Crew catalog was the strangest kind of shopping in the world . All their baby pictures were adorable , of course . And their long lists of achievements and positive qualities were breathtaking . There was no way to know whose genes would make the healthiest , happiest baby . She ought to just flip a couple of coins and allow fate to narrow down the final four to a single winner . She scanned the pictures one more time . Three of the little boys had glossy dark hair . Now that she thought about it , three of them looked a hell of a lot like Mike Beacon . Damn it all . Thanks a ton , subconscious . Lauren picked up the fourth page — the one with the fairer - haired child pictured on it . Donor 5683RE had grown up to be a promising law student who wanted to work on Internet privacy issues . He was a good cook and played soccer on the weekends . He was nothing at all like Mike Beacon . Well then . If all went according to plan , donor 5683RE was going to be the father of her child . She opened her laptop and navigated to the cryobank ’s website . She ordered two vials of Mr. 5683RE , filling in the FedEx information for her fertility clinic back in Manhattan . The transaction set her back $ 1,200 and took five minutes , tops . But this was big — a decision made . A plan put into action . A secret . Lauren cracked open her salad and unwrapped a plastic fork . A month from now , she might be pregnant . Two months from now she might have morning sickness . She placed a hand on her very flat belly and imagined a baby growing in there . Sitting all alone in her suite , she began to smile . It did n’t matter that her parents would freak out about this decision when she eventually got around to telling them . This was her journey , and she was ready to embark . In fact . . . She lifted her hand off her belly and propped her chin in it . She ’d never expected to be single at thirty - one . And she sure had n’t expected to be dumped by the love of her life . But now that the shock and anger were finally wearing off , she could acknowledge that the experience had made her into a more confident single person . Sometime during these past two years she ’d stopped waiting around for her happily - ever - after and started crafting it herself . Take that , Mike . She ate her salad and then went to work on Nate ’s rather overburdened calendar . Now that the play - offs were sure to drag on , there was planning to do . She cast an eye on Nate ’s calendar all the way out to June and tried to figure out where all the landmines lay . There was a trip to China on his docket over Memorial Day . That was almost exactly the moment that the Stanley Cup finals would be played . But there was no way of knowing which day , though , as the league did n’t schedule each new set of games until the participants were decided . Her own graduation ceremony would occur during the play - offs , too . If the Bruisers kept winning , she might have to inform Nate that she would miss a couple of days of team travel to don a cap and gown . Nate would n’t make her miss her own graduation . He was n’t an ogre . “
54827	55149	53711	53711	You	1174	” he ’d said more than once . She would n’t , though . In the first place , she ’d used the corporate tuition - matching program to cut the cost of her education in half . If she quit she ’d owe that money back . But more importantly , she did n’t want to leave either Nate or his company . Even if getting a new job with more responsibility elsewhere would be a thrill , Nate paid her really well to run his C - suite . And she wanted the stability of her seniority there when she became a single mother . Nate ’s company was one of the few in Manhattan to offer on - site day care , too . The first thing she planned to do after getting a positive pregnancy test was to register on the waiting list for a spot . Unlike so many other working women , she ’d be able to swing by the nursery and breastfeed her baby . Given all that she ’d read on the mommy forums she ’d begun trolling , that luxury was worth its weight in gold . Maybe Nate did n’t know it , but Lauren was about to become the most loyal employee who ever lived . She nibbled on her roll and checked the private jet ’s flight plans for Beijing again . And tried really hard to forget about Mike Beacon ’s smile . SIXTEEN TAMPA , FLORIDA MAY 2016 Two days later , the team did only a short practice in Tampa , to keep the guys rested before game two . But Beacon spent some extra time with Silas and the goaltending coach , practicing drills and reviewing strategy . Silas looked good , too . No matter what Coach fired at him he stayed cool , deflecting puck after puck with a Zen - like concentration . “
55157	55188	55189	55189	You	1184	” Beacon said as they got dressed after showering . They were the last two in the locker room . Their teammates were already watching tape in the conference room . “
55193	55194	55189	55189	You	1184	” “
55213	55258	55205	55205	I	91	” the kid grumbled . He was probably thinking back to his last time in the net — in February . Mike had gotten a touch of food poisoning and Silas was called in last minute . The game had been a total disaster . “
55261	55271	55205	55205	I	91	” Mike said , squeezing the kid ’s shoulder . “
55310	55340	55297	55297	I	91	” Though it was unlikely the kid would mind the net at any point during the play - offs , unless Mike got hurt . Silas grit his teeth . “
55401	55402	55391	55391	I	91	” “
55409	55413	55403	55403	You	1184	” Beacon said . “
55445	55446	55435	55435	I	91	” “
55449	55450	55435	55435	I	91	” “
55507	55595	55501	55501	I	91	” Silas made a grunt of acknowledgement . Beacon thumped the kid on the back and left the lockers , ducking into the conference room where the rest of his team was watching video from their first game in Tampa . They ’d lost 2–1 , but they were n’t disheartened . Not yet . They ’d fought hard , and their opponent had gotten lucky with both unlikely bounces of the puck and with the ref ’s calls . Tampa was crackable . Everyone knew it . “
55598	55616	55501	55501	I	91	” Coach Worthington said as he pressed Pause on the footage . He pointed at the screen . “
55670	55685	55659	55659	they	340	” He turned , and his gaze took in every man in the room . “
55751	55760	55747	55747	I	91	” He put a hand to his chest . “
55791	55858	55859	55859	Beacon	2343	” Mike lifted his gaze to the frozen players on the screen — to Tampa ’s center lunging for the puck . Coach was right . These guys were hungry , but their hunger had a wild - eyed desperation to it . They feared coming close to the Cup yet another year , and then failing in the clutch . He could work with that . “
55861	55865	55859	55859	Beacon	2343	” Coach said . “
55871	55872	55859	55859	Beacon	2343	” “
55875	55882	55859	55859	Beacon	2343	” He must have been smiling . “
55918	55919	55916	55916	guys	1866	” “
55922	55930	55916	55916	guys	1866	” O’Doul nodded from across the table . “
55981	55994	55995	55995	I	91	” A chuckle moved through the room , and several players nodded . “
55999	56003	55995	55995	I	91	” Coach said . “
56075	56147	56065	56065	We	1196	” He stood up , and the meeting was adjourned . He headed outdoors instead of upstairs . Most guys would order room service and then try to sleep . But he was too keyed up , so he went out to the poolside tiki bar and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich . He ate it watching sports highlights on TV — including video of himself making a couple of saves . “
56153	56168	56169	56169	Coulda	224	” the kid tending bar asked , topping up Mike ’s ice water glass . “
56173	56181	56169	56169	Coulda	224	” he said . The kid grinned . “
56189	56190	56182	56182	I	91	” “
56193	56194	56182	56182	I	91	” “
56202	56203	56182	56182	I	91	” “
56208	56221	56182	56182	I	91	” Though it was probably a ruse meant to improve his tip . “
56227	56371	56182	56182	I	91	” When he was done , Mike left the kid a generous tip , no matter who the kid was rooting for . He still was n’t sleepy , but the rows of aqua - blue lounge chairs beckoned to him . Carrying his water glass with him , he bypassed all the ones facing the pool in favor of a row in the distance . That spot looked more private , so he headed over , hoping to find it relatively empty . It was , except for one stunning woman in a bikini and sunglasses , a laptop open on her belly . His heart tripped over its own feet . Lauren . Wordlessly , Mike kicked off his shoes and sat down on the deck chair . Then he shucked off his shirt and lay back , closing his eyes . “
56378	56382	56383	56383	I	91	” he said . “
56388	56397	56383	56383	I	91	” Her eyes remained focused on the screen . “
56431	56432	56444	56445	a women	1209	” “
56435	56436	56444	56445	a women	1209	” “
56455	56456	56444	56445	a women	1209	” “
56465	56501	56444	56445	a women	1209	” He stretched out as the sun began to warm his chest , and he hoped she ’d keep talking . Sunshine and Lauren ’s voice — two things he did n’t have enough of . “
56519	56520	56568	56568	I	91	” “
56527	56528	56568	56568	I	91	” “
56578	56653	56568	56568	I	91	” He chuckled , his eyes closed against the sun ’s rays . He hoped Lauren had had a lot of fun on Nate ’s dime , and a big , exciting life these past two years . He ached just to hear how much he ’d missed . I have n’t trusted anyone since , she ’d said the other night . It killed him to know he ’d done that to her . “
56663	56667	56668	56668	I	91	” she asked . “
56677	56700	56703	56703	Lo	1597	” He held perfectly still . But then he opened one eye to see if she was looking . Nope . Figures . “
56705	56709	56703	56703	Lo	1597	” he asked . “
56721	56739	56703	56703	Lo	1597	” He did n’t mind sounding like a lovesick teenager if she ’d keep talking to him . “
56745	56746	56703	56703	Lo	1597	” “
56755	56764	56768	56768	Michael	2343	” She rolled her eyes in his direction . “
56778	56779	56770	56771	Your team	1215	” “
56785	56793	56780	56780	I	91	” She let out a little snort . “
56814	56815	56816	56816	I	91	” “
56823	56848	56816	56816	I	91	” He sat up . She popped out of her chair first , though , and grabbed a wallet out of her shoulder bag . “
56853	57126	56816	56816	I	91	” Her long , bare legs sashayed away , and he groaned to himself . Her hair swung back and forth as she moved , giving him glimpses of smooth shoulders . If he went upstairs to nap right now , the image of Lauren ’s perfect backside would probably torture him . He heard a small thud and looked down . Lauren ’s shoulder bag had tipped over , the contents threatening to spill onto the pavement . He nudged a sunglasses case and a pen back into the bag . Just as he was righting her bag , a prescription pill bottle rolled into view . He read the name of the drug off the label before he could think better of it . Clomifene . What the heck was that ? Right there in the Florida sunshine , a chill crept over him . It was n’t long ago that he ’d lived in a home overflowing with pharmacy bottles . After Shelly ’s death , he ’d filled a small shopping bag with them , dropping off the last of them at the pharmacy for disposal . In fact , Mike and the pharmacist in his Long Island town were on a first - name basis by the time Shelly died . What the hell was Clomifene for ? Easy , he cautioned himself . It could be nothing . When Lauren reappeared at the other end of the pool a minute later , he scrutinized her again . But this time he was n’t ogling her very appealing body . He was looking for signs of trouble . “
57129	57141	56816	56816	I	91	” she said with a frown when she reached her chair . “
57144	57316	57317	57317	Lauren	114	” he said quickly . He put his head back and closed his eyes again . Lauren settled herself beside him . Before long he heard the tapping of her fingers on the keyboard . He turned the name of the drug over in his mind , trying to decide what it could be . Lauren had n’t taken any medication when they were together . He tried to think of something a healthy woman might take , and came up dry . Maybe it ’s an antidepressant , his guilty mind offered up . Now he was never falling asleep . He slipped his Katt Phone out of his pocket and searched the name of the drug . It came up right away . And the Wikipedia description was both a huge relief and completely confusing . Clomifene is one of the most widely prescribed fertility drugs in the world . His chin snapped toward Lauren . And his gaze zapped right to her very flat , very beautiful belly . “
57319	57320	57317	57317	Lauren	114	” “
57323	57361	57317	57317	Lauren	114	” He opened his mouth and then shut it again . It was really none of his goddamn business . None at all . It did n’t matter if he was burning up with surprise and curiosity . “
57368	57405	57406	57406	Nate	91	” she asked , staring at him . Then her phone rang . She snapped her laptop shut and reached into her bag where it lay on the ground , yanking out her own Katt Phone . “
57414	57447	57406	57406	Nate	91	” There was a silence , and Mike fought against his interest to study the pill bottle again . It was probably visible . No . He was n’t going to look . “
57454	57458	57406	57406	Nate	91	” she said . “
57469	57477	57479	57479	you	91	” She gave him a sideways glance . “
57483	57484	57479	57479	you	91	” “
57487	57495	57496	57496	I	91	” he said when she hung up . “
57502	57503	57496	57496	I	91	” “
57511	57547	57509	57509	Mike	2343	” She flung her things into the bag without looking at him . Then she pulled a sleeveless knit dress over her head , and his traitorous eyes followed its path down her sleek body . “
57555	57929	57931	57931	you	1218	” Then she was gone , leaving him sitting there , Googling the heck out of a fertility drug and trying to decide what it might mean . SEVENTEEN Six hours later , Beacon had only one thing on his mind : a black , six - ounce rubber disc . You do n’t get twelve years as a starting NHL goalie unless you can concentrate when it counts . It was the middle of a hard - fought second period and the score was still zip - zip . Brooklyn was skating hard against Tampa , defending their zone and taking shots , too . They just had n’t quite gotten lucky enough to score . Tampa was frustrated , too . Beacon could tell they were working harder than they ’d expected to . Their star forward was Danny Skews — a wiry dude with an angry snarl . Beacon had never liked the guy . Tonight his face was even redder than usual . Beacon thought he looked ready to crack under the weight of his own frustration . That ’s cool , he told himself . A rattled offensive player was easier to read . Their opponents got a hold of the puck , and play moved down the ice toward Beacon . He stayed loose , watching the whole zone at once . That was his job — to see every possible outcome of the play , and to be ready to backstop everyone else ’s errors . Skews passed to his wing , who passed it back . Then something beautiful happened . O’Doul got into Skews ’s blind spot , and none of the Tampa players gave their man the heads - up . It should n’t have worked , but O’Doul leaned in at just the right split second and blocked the next pass , getting his stick on the puck just long enough to redirect it back to Trevi . Skews got stripped while twenty thousand people watched . The guy ’s response was to trip O’Doul , who went down grinning . And then it got even better , because Skews got called for the trip . That ’s when his composure snapped . “
57933	57945	57931	57931	you	1218	” he screamed at the ref , while O’Doul openly laughed . “
57949	57958	57931	57931	you	1218	” The ref pointed toward the sin bin . “
57965	57969	57931	57931	you	1218	” Skews argued . “
57985	57990	57992	57992	you	1218	” the ref offered . “
57994	57999	57992	57992	you	1218	” Skews spat again . “
58010	58018	58019	58019	Classy	230	” He turned toward the penalty box . “
58021	58053	58019	58019	Classy	230	” Trevi muttered as he skated past . Beacon had only been a bystander to this little drama up until now , but the gay slur instantly doubled his blood pressure . “
58056	58063	58019	58019	Classy	230	” Beacon called after the ref . “
58091	58221	58084	58085	the network	1221	” The ref frowned , his eyes following Skews to the box , where the red - faced player was still cursing under his breath . Beacon saw the official think it through , his gaze snapping toward the television cameras . He turned and skated toward the scorekeepers ’ bench . When he got there , he leaned in to confer with the official , and the linesmen skated over to join them . Beacon fidgeted in front of his net , watching the confused faces of his teammates . Although the delay was probably only ten or fifteen seconds and counting , it was unusual in hockey . A moment later , Beacon was stunned to hear the announcer call for Skews ’s ejection from the game . “
58225	58432	58433	58433	Trevi	533	” the ref had called . But instead of a bench minor , the guy was thrown the hell out . There was a roar inside the stadium , as well as inside Beacon ’s head . Holy shit . Holy shit , he repeated to himself . Players had been ejected from play - offs games before , but it was rare , and Beacon could n’t think of an instance that did not involve egregious bodily harm to another player . Beacon was willing to lay odds that this would be the first time in NHL history that a player was ejected for hate speech . And in a play - offs game ! Holy shit . Their opponents were going to lose their ever - loving minds . While the crowd continued to shout and stamp their feet — some in favor of this development , but many against — the refs called for a face - off . All his teammates were rested from their unexpected timeout , but their faces looked tense as the puck dropped . Tampa won the puck , and play transferred quickly to Beacon ’s end of the ice . His attention snapped back to the game . “
58437	58455	58456	58456	Man	231	” he barked at O’Doul , who could n’t see the field as clearly as he could . “
58459	58586	58587	58588	Well boys	1222	” he shouted at Castro a moment later . His whole world was reduced to the scrape of blades against ice and the slapping scramble of sticks and bodies . His boys cleared the puck before things got too crazy . They iced it , though , so both teams went scrambling toward the other end of the rink . And it was on like Donkey Kong for the rest of a very sweaty period . Ultimately , the loss of their star center cost Tampa , though . And it was Beringer who put one in the net for Brooklyn before the buzzer rang . They all clomped down the chute into the visitors ’ dressing room for the second intermission , awash in adrenaline . “
58594	58602	58587	58588	Well boys	1222	” Coach said , snapping his gum . “
58641	58642	58643	58643	We	1224	” “
58649	58654	58655	58655	Skews	422	” Beacon spoke up . “
58664	58665	58669	58669	sir	422	” “
58671	58680	58681	58681	My	91	” Coach put a hand to his chest . “
58711	58801	58802	58802	They	1222	” There were murmurs of agreement while everyone slugged back water and tried to stay loose . Beacon did some stretches , and then it was time to get back out there . As everyone predicted , their opponents were downright pissy about the ejection . Things got chippy right away , and the game devolved into a hairy melee with a lot of artless potshots taken all around . Beacon watched Leo Trevi get slashed in the back by a Tampa stick when the refs were n’t looking . “
58806	58817	58818	58818	We	1222	” Beacon reminded the sweaty rookie as he skated by . “
58822	58823	58818	58818	We	1222	” “
58826	58902	58818	58818	We	1222	” Trevi said through clenched teeth . It was a brutal period , but scoreless for Tampa . When the ref caught one of their opponents ’ illegal checks , Brooklyn got a power play and used it to score one more goal . When the buzzer sounded , it was Brooklyn over Tampa , 2–0 . The minute he followed his team back into the locker room , Georgia Worthington scurried up to him . “
58970	58971	59052	59052	I	91	” “
58976	59019	59052	59052	I	91	” He stripped off his pads and tried to shake off his exhaustion . Georgia was a clever girl , and her instincts had never steered him wrong . Talking to reporters did n’t sound like all that much fun , though . “
59029	59033	59034	59034	They	1222	” Georgia pressed . “
59050	59051	59052	59052	I	91	” “
59081	59097	59103	59103	I	91	” That made for a pretty good quote . He liked the sound of it . “
59122	59123	59127	59127	you	1229	” “
59129	59159	59127	59127	you	1229	” Georgia suggested . She was always massaging their language to make them sound more approachable . He chuckled , grabbing his jersey and hauling it over his head . “
59166	59193	59162	59162	I	91	” Sure enough , he was saddened to find three sports writers and a cameraman waiting by his bench when he came back from the showers . “
59201	59210	59162	59162	I	91	” he joked , grabbing his suit pants . “
59221	59265	59162	59162	I	91	” He ducked back into a more private area near the showers to change , so his ass would n’t end up on television . Then he came back and put on a shirt while all three journalists asked their questions at once . “
59280	59281	59162	59162	I	91	” “
59291	59292	59162	59162	I	91	” “
59301	59302	59303	59303	I	91	” “
59315	59330	59309	59309	I	91	” he said slowly . He buttoned his cuffs and looked into the camera . “
59367	59378	59390	59390	he	556	” Georgia gave him a wink from behind the cameraman . “
59397	59401	59390	59390	he	556	” he continued . “
59409	59410	59390	59390	he	556	” “
59424	59436	59390	59390	he	556	” suggested a male reporter who was scribbling on a notepad . “
59447	59458	59459	59459	I	91	” he said , trying not to sound pissed off . “
59479	59503	59469	59469	his	556	” Georgia gave him a thumbs - up . And she was smiling , so he decided to quit while he was ahead . “
59518	59530	59516	59516	you	1243	” He turned around and grabbed his tie off a hook . “
59538	59542	59531	59531	I	91	” he added . “
59560	59594	59595	59595	Elsa	2199	” The reporters scattered as they often did when he played the single dad card . But his phone was ringing . He fished it out of his bag and took the call . “
59597	59598	59599	59599	Daddy	533	” “
59605	59606	59601	59601	You	533	” “
59611	59641	59609	59609	baby	533	” At least one fan was happy with him tonight . Sitting down on the bench , he stuck a finger in his ear so he could hear better . “
59656	59663	59664	59664	I	91	” She was talking really fast . “
59688	59692	59685	59685	you	533	” He chuckled . “
59704	59705	59706	59706	Hans	120	” “
59727	59728	59717	59717	I	91	” “
59732	59736	59741	59741	sweetie	793	” he said . “
59743	59744	59741	59741	sweetie	793	” “
59751	59752	59749	59749	Daddy	533	” “
59758	59759	59749	59749	Daddy	533	” “
59766	59767	59760	59760	Hans	120	” “
59770	59771	59774	59774	Beak	128	” “
59776	59783	59774	59774	Beak	128	” Hans said a moment later . “
59792	59798	59790	59790	Hans	120	” The German hipster laughed . “
59813	59814	59790	59790	Hans	120	” “
59821	59822	59823	59823	I	91	” “
59837	59838	59823	59823	I	91	” “
59882	59883	59884	59884	Ja	125	” “
59886	59890	59884	59884	Ja	125	” Hans laughed . “
59901	59902	59884	59884	Ja	125	” “
59912	59917	59884	59884	Ja	125	” He laughed again . “
59933	59934	59924	59924	Elsa	2199	” “
59940	60128	60131	60131	Lauren	114	” He hung up smiling . EIGHTEEN BROOKLYN , NEW YORK MAY 2016 When Lauren got back to Brooklyn , the first thing she did was to push back Nate ’s China trip into late June . Her old hockey - watching habits had kicked in hard , and she had a gut feeling the Brooklyn team would win this series and advance to the Eastern Conference Final . And , weirdly , she was n’t sure she minded . Maybe she would n’t admit it aloud , but it was fun watching her boys win again . She ’d caught herself thinking of them as her boys again , just like in the old days . For the past two years it had hurt too much to think of the team that way . But lately she felt more relaxed in their company . Now that she and Mike were on speaking terms , it was n’t hard for her to walk into the players ’ lounge in the headquarters on Hudson Avenue , handing out the media kits that Georgia ’s publicity office had prepared . “
60133	60145	60131	60131	Lauren	114	” Castro rumbled as he took his copy from her hands . “
60155	60156	60147	60147	I	91	” “
60166	60199	60147	60147	I	91	” she said , surprising herself with her own cheerful tone . She sounded like the Lauren of years past — the one who teased the players instead of snapping at them . “
60227	60510	60225	60225	Tommy	103	” She even gave Mike a smile as she handed him a copy . And she did n’t let her eyes linger on his darker ones , or feel the heat of his heavy - lidded gaze on her . Not much , anyway . The players had spent the morning with the coaching coordinators or with Ari , the massage therapist . The Brooklyn HQ had the feel of a war bunker this week . It was all hands on deck . Meals were catered into the lounge so that nobody had to leave . The publicity office was overrun with calls , which meant support staff of all stripes were pitching in . The thrum of play - offs fever had reached even Lauren ’s frigid heart . From Becca ’s desk , she helped out with whatever needed doing , while also keeping tabs on the e - mail chain regarding all the current projects in New York . She and her boss were burning the candle at both ends , looking out for the team ’s needs while chatting with their Manhattan colleagues all day . She kept an eye on the sports headlines , too , even though it was n’t her job to worry about the Bruisers ’ news . There was plenty of chatter about the incident in Tampa . The league had fined Skews for his comments , and the player had issued a stuttering apology , asking for forgiveness from whoever he ’d offended . Twitter lit up with commentary . Much of it was supportive of the sanctions against Skews , but there was a lot of ugliness among hockey fans complaining about “
60513	60571	60572	60572	Tampa	38	” and favoritism . There was some taunting to the tune of : Brooklyn ca n’t win without getting our best players thrown out of the game . Fans would say anything at all . Lauren was used to it . But around noon on game day she saw a blog post that made her skin crawl . “
60584	61096	60581	60582	Mike Beacon	2343	” It was on a skanky site — not a real news outlet , and it was obviously click bait . But when the commentary loaded , her blood pressure spiked anyway . Saturday ’s drama aside , everyone knows Brooklyn ’s real weakness . Their goal bench is the thinnest in the NHL . Without Mike Beacon they ’d be down to Silas Kelly . Kelly was an early - round draft pick that has n’t panned out . Early last season he had a few good nights , but always chokes as the season progresses . He ’s never stood between the pipes during a play - offs game . Tampa fans are probably all fantasizing about a Mike Beacon injury tonight . He ’ll be watching his back for sure . It was the most irresponsible piece of tripe Lauren had ever read . She forwarded the link to Georgia , then just sat there at her desk , stewing over it . Georgia ’s reply was swift . I saw it . Just smack talk . Sure . It was smack talk that had been retweeted nearly six hundred times before five P.M. But who was counting ? At six o’clock , Lauren accompanied her boss to the arena . She did n’t avoid the place anymore , but watching the action would be stressful for brand - new reasons . When the game began , it was a brutal one right from the first face - off . Both teams skated as if they had something to prove . And they did . Lauren found herself unaccountably nervous . Maybe it ’s the hormones , she told herself . The medication she ’d just started taking was probably to blame for the nervous stirring in her stomach . Standing in Nate ’s box , watching the boys fly down the ice , it was hard to remember that she was n’t supposed to care about this team anymore . For more than a decade of her life she ’d watched fifty games a year . And well before she and Mike were ever a couple , her eyes used to always come to rest on the goalie . She knew his stance so well she could draw him with her eyes closed . His long limbs were loose , waiting to spring into action . Even the set of his shoulders as he watched the action was familiar . In a month , or six weeks at the latest , this exciting detour into her old life would be finished . She might be on a jet to China , with prenatal vitamins in her carry - on . Tell that to her thumping heart . Tampa made an unlikely shot on goal . She stopped breathing as Mike lunged for it . It smacked safely into his glove , but not before her heart nearly failed . In front of her , Nate sat watching the game with an expression as calm as Buddha ’s . “
61103	61148	60581	60582	Mike Beacon	2343	” Nate ’s father asked , putting a hand on his son ’s shoulder . Nate ’s parents were visiting from their home in Iowa , where they were school teachers . Lauren had met them several times already . They were lovely people . “
61155	61160	60581	60582	Mike Beacon	2343	” his mother squealed . “
61170	61220	60581	60582	Mike Beacon	2343	” Nate , being Nate , just shrugged . Lauren could n’t sit still any longer . She popped up out of her seat and stalked over to the food table where Georgia hovered . As Lauren watched , she grabbed a cheese puff and took an eager bite . “
61227	61233	61234	61234	We	1253	” she said , chewing . “
61239	61240	61241	61241	I	91	” “
61244	61258	61241	61241	I	91	” Lauren nabbed a cheese puff , too , and took a bite . “
61265	61269	61241	61241	I	91	” Georgia laughed . “
61280	61281	61274	61274	I	91	” “
61284	61446	61274	61274	I	91	” Lauren said , feeling reckless . All her old habits were already thrown to the wind . What was one more ? And she would probably be giving up wine soon . Not to mention hockey . She let Georgia pour her a glass of sauvignon blanc , and then the two of them watched as closely as they dared while the game ground onward . If she keeled over from stress tonight , her obituary might as well read : Death by game III in the second round . Down on the ice , a fight broke out between Brooklyn ’s Crikey and the other team ’s scrapper . The fans stood up at their seats and cheered . Lauren held her breath until Crikey shoved the other man down to the ice , and the refs broke it up . But the players kept chirping at each other even as the linesmen hustled them back to their teammates . “
61452	61460	61274	61274	I	91	” Georgia said , chewing her lip . “
61494	61495	61475	61475	I	91	” “
61513	61530	61533	61533	I	91	” Lauren used her best bitch voice , but tonight it was meant to be ironic . “
61546	61550	61533	61533	I	91	” Georgia grinned . “
61575	61576	61577	61577	I	91	” “
61582	61735	61577	61577	I	91	” she said before realizing it was never going to happen . The invitation was nice , but she knew she could n’t follow through . These weeks with the team were cathartic . They were helping her to let go of some of her own grief about times gone by . But if she stuck around she ’d just end up staring at the goalie ’s well - padded backside all night , trying not to imagine how things might have been different . That would n’t be healthy . Not even a little . The game ground onward . It was 1–1 near the end of the second period , and she and Georgia were practically dancing a nervous jig . Lauren was on her second glass of wine and Georgia had finished all the cheese puffs . The door to Nate ’s box burst open and Rebecca marched in . “
61741	61745	61577	61577	I	91	” she demanded . “
61750	61769	61577	61577	I	91	” Lauren and Georgia said in unison . Nate turned around in his seat , his face unreadable . “
61774	61779	61577	61577	I	91	” Becca said immediately . “
61796	61819	61786	61786	I	91	” He turned around again , his focus back on the ice . Becca grabbed Georgia ’s wineglass and sipped from it . “
61830	61831	61820	61820	I	91	” “
61834	61839	61820	61820	I	91	” Becca silenced her . “
61851	61866	61848	61849	my jailer	1259	” Georgia fetched a soda for Becca and then fixed her with a stare . “
61896	61897	61893	61893	Nate	91	” “
61900	61921	61893	61893	Nate	91	” Becca took a long sip of the soda , and Lauren could swear her eyes looked a little shifty . “
61928	61929	61893	61893	Nate	91	” “
61934	61968	61969	61969	Baby	163	” Georgia waited for more information , but none was forthcoming . She was spared from further grilling because Tampa got the puck away from Trevi and turned toward Brooklyn ’s defensive zone . “
61973	62068	62071	62071	Jesus	730	” Georgia yelped . Everyone in the box tensed as Tampa rushed the net . They fired on Mike , who deflected a shot off his stick . But the rebound was tight , and he had to dive for a second one . Nate ’s box held its collective breath while Brooklyn tried to clear it . Tampa took aim again and two players charged the net — Skews and his left wing . When the winger shot , Mike slapped the puck away . And then Skews plowed right into the goalie . “
62073	62084	62071	62071	Jesus	730	” Nate said , losing his calm expression for once . “
62094	62390	62087	62087	you	730	” He did n’t even get the words out before Mike threw off his gloves and lunged for the other man . • • • Mike had n’t really lost his cool in a long damn time . But when the asshole he was now famous for benching so recklessly ran into him , he just snapped . Later , he would n’t even remember dropping his gloves or skating out of the crease . There was just the guy ’s stupid smirk , and the pounding desire inside Mike ’s chest to knock it off his face . There was no skill to his attack , it was all just adrenaline and instinct . He grabbed Skews ’s sweater and swung . The punch connected , but not well . And once his opponent shook off his surprise , he was swinging , too . Mike ducked and then switched hands , punching the other man in the face mask , which flew off . The next thirty seconds were a blur of fists and grunts . His face stung and his right hand was killing him . Maybe the fight lasted sixty seconds , but it felt like an eternity before Skews finally lost his footing and fell , bringing Mike down on top of him . The refs jumped in to pull them apart , and Mike was left panting , his pulse wild . He had n’t been in a fight in three years . And would n’t this be fun to explain to his child ? There was blood dripping off his face . He knew he looked bad when Henry — the trainer — skidded out on his street shoes to take a look at the damage . Fuck . “
62395	62416	62391	62391	I	91	” he insisted even before Henry reached him . The guy pressed a cotton pad to his cheekbone and winced . “
62427	62428	62417	62417	You	1261	” “
62438	62445	62417	62417	You	1261	” Mike said , skating backward . “
62452	62561	62446	62446	You	1261	” Henry fussed a minute longer . But then he stepped carefully off the ice , and play resumed . Mercifully , the last four were played at the other end of the ice . Somehow the fight had lit a fire under his guys . They skated like demons , which led to an ugly goal by Trevi in front of the net with less than thirty seconds left in the period . Yaaas ! They had the lead ! The doctor and the trainer clucked over him like hens during the intermission . They used some kind of nasty medical glue to seal up his face . “
62579	62588	62446	62446	You	1261	” he said as they worked on him . “
62594	62595	62603	62603	him	402	” “
62605	62610	62596	62596	Shoulda	402	” Coach Worthington said . “
62620	62621	62596	62596	Shoulda	402	” “
62630	62634	62635	62635	You	1262	” Coach pressed . “
62656	62662	62663	62663	I	91	” This was entirely true . “
62667	62672	62663	62663	I	91	” he insisted anyway . “
62683	62930	62663	62663	I	91	” Even so , it was a grueling third period . He let one in after six minutes , which made everyone tense . Fortunately , a penalty was called against Tampa when Skews tripped O’Doul . Brooklyn took the opportunity to score , which restored the team ’s equilibrium . But not Beacon ’s . For the rest of the game , his face throbbed mightily , and his boys looked tight and tense . So did Tampa , though . And in the end , their opponent could n’t get it done . It was 3–2 at the buzzer . Mike skated off the ice thinking about painkillers and a good , cold beer . If this were a regular season game , they ’d be done with this opponent for a while . But not in the play - offs . They were three games into a best - of - seven series , and while their 2–1 lead was nice , the job was far from over . And forty - seven hours from now he ’d be face - to - face with Skews again . Punching him had been a dumb idea , Mike was ready to admit . Now he ’d be expected to fight the guy again the day after tomorrow . He did n’t even make it to his locker before the press was on it , the bright light of a TV camera in his face . “
62939	62946	62933	62933	I	91	” he said with a scowl . “
62958	62970	62947	62947	I	91	” Outside the dressing room door he found Elsa and Hans . “
62974	62979	62947	62947	I	91	” his daughter demanded . “
62986	62997	62947	62947	I	91	” He chuckled , which only made his face hurt . “
63016	63025	63026	63026	You	91	” He put a hand over the bandage . “
63047	63048	63043	63043	I	91	” “
63056	63074	63077	63077	baby	124	” She looked so young when she asked the question , and his heart broke a little . “
63112	63127	63128	63128	You	91	” He moved in to hug her , but she wrinkled up her nose . “
63133	63134	63128	63128	You	91	” “
63137	63141	63128	63128	You	91	” he laughed . “
63156	63157	63148	63148	I	91	” “
63161	63162	63148	63148	I	91	” “
63165	63216	63148	63148	I	91	” She beamed and walked off with the violin teacher / babysitter / roommate . He watched them go , wishing he could leave with them , too . • • • Seventeen years later he ’d showered and then submitted his face to an unreasonable amount of further prodding . “
63223	63233	63218	63218	I	91	” he grumbled to the doctor inspecting his face . “
63254	63266	63267	63267	I	91	” He might have laughed , but it would have hurt . “
63271	63276	63267	63267	I	91	” he said carefully . “
63281	63286	63267	63267	I	91	” the doctor advised . “
63306	63337	63338	63338	Mike	2343	” He was nearly the last player to leave the building . And , just as he donned his suit jacket , Lauren ’s face peered into the dressing room . “
63340	63341	63338	63338	Mike	2343	” “
63346	63351	63344	63344	baby	793	” Her gaze dipped . “
63357	63365	63344	63344	baby	793	” she asked , her voice tentative . “
63373	63455	63368	63368	I	91	” He patted his pocket to make sure he had keys , a wallet and a phone , then he approached the spot where she stood by the door . She did n’t let him get close , though . She stepped out of the way and folded her arms in front of her chest , in a classic defensive posture . But he did n’t buy it . His girl was worried about him . It had to mean something . “
63460	63474	63368	63368	I	91	” he asked , following her down the long corridor toward the exit . “
63483	63484	63368	63368	I	91	” “
63492	63496	63497	63497	I	91	” he asked . “
63515	63522	63505	63505	I	91	” He gave her an out . “
63530	63537	63525	63525	I	91	” she said after a beat . “
63540	63561	63562	63562	We	1272	” They went outside , where Lauren opened the door to a hired sedan and sat down on the backseat . “
63570	63576	63562	63562	We	1272	” she told the driver . “
63582	63587	63579	63579	your	2343	” she asked Mike . “
63598	63642	63579	63579	your	2343	” he said , thinking back to the days when they were planning to move in together . He ’d been full of anticipation for the time when they would have their own place . Now she did n’t even know his address . “
63653	63664	63644	63644	we	1272	” Lauren told the driver as Mike shut the door . “
63672	63673	63666	63667	the FDR	479	” “
63681	63752	63666	63667	the FDR	479	” the driver said , tapping on his dash instruments to pull up his GPS . The car slid away from the curb , and they rode in silence for a minute . Then Mike found himself thinking about that pill bottle in her bag , and all the guilty feelings it had dredged up . He turned his aching neck to look at her in the semi - darkness . “
63758	63759	63666	63667	the FDR	479	” “
63762	63775	63666	63667	the FDR	479	” she said , resting her briefcase on the seat between them . “
63781	63785	63666	63667	the FDR	479	” She yawned . “
63789	63790	63791	63791	I	91	” “
63803	63820	63791	63791	I	91	” He grinned , which was n’t easy with a big old bandage on his face . “
63833	63834	63839	63839	your	1276	” “
63844	63848	63839	63839	your	1276	” He shrugged . “
63856	63860	63839	63839	your	1276	” She snorted . “
63863	63864	63839	63839	your	1276	” “
63883	63940	63941	63941	You	1276	” He leaned back against the leather seat and smiled . It was the goalie mentality . If you stood around worrying about the goal you just let in , there was no way you ’d be ready to stop the next one . And Lauren had always had his number . Today was no different . “
63947	63948	63949	63949	I	91	” “
63953	63971	63972	63972	Lo	1597	” She bit her lip , and he watched , wishing he could bite it , too . “
63980	63981	63982	63982	I	91	” “
63990	63991	63992	63993	Miss Grammar	238	” “
64002	64012	64015	64015	Jesus	730	” Her head whipped around to look at him . “
64024	64025	64018	64018	you	1597	” “
64071	64072	64062	64062	I	91	” “
64075	64083	64062	64062	I	91	” She let out a big breath . “
64087	64095	64062	64062	I	91	” He made his best contrite face . “
64116	64122	64112	64112	you	1597	” He cleared his throat . “
64137	64147	64128	64128	I	91	” had a lot of wild sex with you . “
64150	64162	64128	64128	I	91	” she said for the second time inside of a minute . “
64183	64184	64173	64173	You	1280	” “
64191	64199	64173	64173	You	1280	” He let out a nervous chuckle . “
64207	64216	64173	64173	You	1280	” She put her head in her hands . “
64240	64241	64237	64238	my doctor	1282	” “
64246	64252	64237	64238	my doctor	1282	” His head was spinning . “
64262	64302	64237	64238	my doctor	1282	” He tried to picture Lauren bringing her newborn home to a quiet apartment . Those early days were rough , with the baby crying all the time . He felt a stab of something like fear for her . “
64305	64318	64237	64238	my doctor	1282	” He looked up to see her staring daggers at him from . “
64328	64329	64330	64330	I	91	” “
64336	64341	64330	64330	I	91	” he said quickly . “
64361	64362	64365	64365	Lauren	114	” “
64377	64406	64367	64367	You	1280	” Not like the bar is set very high , though . That ’s when the car slid up to his corner and the driver cleared his throat . “
64410	64411	64414	64415	that one	1285	” “
64417	64451	64455	64455	Mike	2343	” he said , pointing . Lauren sat up a little straighter and stopped glaring at him long enough to peer out her window at the antique brick facade of his row house . “
64457	64463	64455	64455	Mike	2343	” Her voice was sharp . “
64466	64536	64455	64455	Mike	2343	” he said , feeling more than a little embarrassed . It was a ridiculously nice house , and fancier than he ’d really planned on buying . But when you needed at least three bedrooms and you ’re in a hurry , you had to buy what was on the market . He opened the door , wondering where she lived , and what it was like there . “
64545	64573	64414	64415	that one	1285	” he heard himself ask . He wished he could take back everything he ’d said in the past five minutes . Slowly she shook her head . “
64586	64589	64579	64579	I	91	” Right . “
64607	64608	64579	64579	I	91	” “
64612	64933	64610	64610	you	1597	” she said stiffly . He shut the door and stepped onto the curb so the car could roll away . A moment later the car ’s taillights turned out of sight . NINETEEN TAMPA , FLORIDA MAY 2016 Four days later Lauren knelt in child ’s pose on her yoga mat , which she ’d unfurled on the wood floor in an exercise studio in the team ’s Tampa hotel . At the front of the room , Ari took the class through some breathing exercises . Lauren expanded her diaphragm on command , inhaling deeply . But she tuned Ari out in favor of indulging herself in a few private play - offs calculations . The location of play - offs series games was always dependent on team standings . In this case , Tampa had entered the postseason with the higher ranking . So they ’d enjoyed a home ice advantage for the first two games . Then there had been two in Brooklyn — the one where Mike fought Skews , and then another . Which they ’d lost , unfortunately . The series was now tied 2–2 , and Lauren was hoping her boys could win the next two in a row . According to the rules , game five was back in Tampa , which accounted for the location of today ’s team yoga class . Game six would happen in Brooklyn . If the Bruisers could win two in a row , the series would be over then . However . If the series lasted seven games , the final one would take place in Tampa . That was n’t going to be good for Lauren . Because on the date of game seven , she needed to be in New York , where her reproductive endocrinologist was located . If her calculations were right , she ’d be ovulating then . . . “
64938	64948	64610	64610	you	1597	” Ari said at the front of the room . “
64989	65099	65300	65301	Warrior II	240	” Lauren listened to Ari ’s voice and tried to shake off her private worries . Upstairs in her hotel room she had a test kit which would help her predict her ovulation . Today she ’d take her last dose of the fertility medication , then she could begin testing tomorrow . Maybe everything could still work out fine . Her body was unpredictable enough that she ’d needed the drug to regulate her cycle . Maybe she would ovulate while she was still in New York for game six , or maybe her ovaries would wait until after game seven . Whenever the test kit gave her the “
65102	65174	65300	65301	Warrior II	240	” indicator , she ’d call the doctor to make an appointment for her intrauterine insemination . The clinic was open seven days a week to accommodate the fickle ovaries of its patients . Either way , she ’d cheer hard for Brooklyn during games five and six . Win this , so we can stay home , she ’d be praying . Ari brought her class into a standing position . “
65183	65187	65300	65301	Warrior II	240	” she instructed . “
65206	65297	65300	65301	Warrior II	240	” As Lauren dove , she admired Mike ’s well - muscled backside a couple of rows ahead of her . He was wearing a pair of Lycra shorts that were probably illegal in several states . When he folded his body forward , his nose came right to his knees , and his leg muscles stood at perfect attention like handsome soldiers ready for battle . Wowzers . Ari took the class through its first sun salutation , and Lauren found her eyes drifting to Mike over and over . “
65303	65365	65300	65301	Warrior II	240	” the teacher said , and Mike lunged forward , his arms outstretched perfectly , his back muscles rippling . Gawd . He was so beautiful . She ’d never met anyone more comfortable in his own body . When they were together he used to walk around naked all the time , while she tried not to swallow her tongue . “
65373	65400	65401	65401	I	91	” she ’d asked him one January evening , as he ’d poured her a glass of wine wearing nothing but a pair of baggy shorts . “
65405	65410	65401	65401	I	91	” he ’d explained . “
65429	65655	65656	65656	Mike	2343	” If memory served , she ’d done that very thing about fifteen minutes later . In the past , when Lauren had fantasized about baby - making , she ’d always imagined conceiving while burning up the sheets in his bed . Getting pregnant on a table at the fertility clinic had never been part of her life ’s plan . But that ’s okay , she reminded herself . Things change , and I ’m done feeling bitter . She followed the class into downward - facing dog pose and stretched her hamstrings . Yoga was relaxing . Maybe Ari would help her find a prenatal yoga class if she became pregnant next week . Next week . Wow . A little zing of excitement pulsed through her body . There were good things happening in her life , and not one of them depended on Mike Beacon . After class , Lauren wiped down her yoga mat and rolled it up . She pulled a stretchy little skirt over her yoga leggings and took the elevator up to the top floor of the hotel . She occupied the usual suite , even though Nathan would n’t arrive to occupy the adjacent one until tonight . Humming to herself , she almost did n’t notice the man standing beside her hotel room door . “
65658	65678	65656	65656	Mike	2343	” she squeaked , wishing too late that she had n’t sounded so much like a teenage fan girl . “
65689	65693	65682	65682	I	91	” he said . “
65698	65699	65682	65682	I	91	” “
65702	65826	65682	65682	I	91	” She took out her keycard , and tried to avoid glancing at his muscular legs . At least he ’d pulled on a T - shirt and a pair of baggy shorts over his tight ones . That made concentrating a little easier . Though that T - shirt was stretched tightly across his pecs , and his skin glowed with the sweat of yoga exertion . . . Stop . She had to cut out all the lustful thoughts about him . Thanks , hormones . The door gave way and she stepped into her hotel suite . At least it was n’t the same room or the same town where they ’d had their recent sex fest . Small mercies . “
65831	65841	65682	65682	I	91	” Mike said , closing the door behind himself . “
65844	65892	65682	65682	I	91	” She had no idea what he wanted to discuss . Frowning , he walked past her and sat down on the leather footstool in the suite ’s seating area . He crossed his delectable arms in front of that lickable chest and looked up at her . “
65898	65925	65682	65682	I	91	” The small demand rankled for some reason . But she obeyed the request because it would probably get him out of her room more quickly . “
65941	65951	65932	65932	I	91	” She sat on the sofa across from him . “
65957	65968	65970	65971	a stranger	1294	” he said , his dark eyes boring into her . “
65973	65974	65970	65971	a stranger	1294	” “
65980	65991	65970	65971	a stranger	1294	” Had she missed the first part of this conversation ? “
65998	66026	65970	65971	a stranger	1294	” She had to take a moment to play back the words he ’d just spoken , because they did n’t make a whole lot of sense . “
66032	66033	66034	66034	I	91	” “
66041	66046	66052	66053	a family	1297	” he said simply . “
66061	66103	66055	66055	We	1296	” Her blood pressure kicked up several notches in a big fat hurry . And since avoidance had been her go - to response to all things Mike Beacon these past two years , she tried to cut off the conversation . “
66128	66132	66133	66133	I	91	” He winced . “
66160	66178	66152	66152	I	91	” As if it were as simple as a gift he could drop off on her doorstep . “
66188	66197	66152	66152	I	91	” she yelped , her voice getting high . “
66211	66235	66152	66152	I	91	” She hated the sound of hysteria that was creeping into her voice . He held her eyes , though his looked remorseful . “
66250	66251	66252	66252	You	91	” “
66265	66271	66252	66252	You	91	” He shook his head . “
66290	66305	66307	66307	you	91	” If exploding heads were a real thing , hers would have just detonated . “
66324	66351	66354	66354	baby	793	” Mike did something very unexpected then . He smiled . The corners of his mouth turned up , and the smile was slow and sweet . “
66394	66481	66482	66482	I	91	” Lauren stood up suddenly . Her heart was still galloping , and her hands felt twitchy . She hated all the anger that tightened her chest . It was all well and good to tell yourself to give up on the bitterness , and it had worked just fine on a yoga mat . But when some macho athlete sat down in your hotel suite and informed you that you should have his baby , it was a little harder to keep a cool head . “
66490	66499	66482	66482	I	91	” she said , walking toward the door . “
66519	66520	66521	66521	We	1306	” “
66533	66567	66521	66521	We	1306	” He stood up slowly . He stalked toward her , his dark eyes serious . And when he reached her at the doorway , he took one of her hands and squeezed . “
66575	66594	66521	66521	We	1306	” He kissed her palm , and the play - off beard he was sporting tickled her palm . “
66611	66646	66647	66649	The consummate goalie	1307	” But that was the wrong thing to say . If she was going to have a child with someone , it should n’t be with a man who was acting out of guilt . “
66651	66655	66647	66649	The consummate goalie	1307	” she whispered . “
66666	66667	66647	66649	The consummate goalie	1307	” “
66670	66676	66647	66649	The consummate goalie	1307	” He shook his head . “
66701	66711	66716	66716	Mike	2343	” She pulled her hand out of his grasp . “
66749	67353	66740	66740	I	91	” She jerked the door open , the instructions very clear . He gave her one more long look . And then he walked out . Lauren closed the door behind him and then stomped over to the leather sofa where she promptly curled up into a ball on its expensive surface . Every time Mike Beacon opened his mouth , her life became more confusing . Not a half hour ago she ’d been fantasizing about him during yoga . But when he offered to do the very thing she ’d always dreamed about , she ’d thrown him out . But of course she had . You had to trust the father of your child . And her trust in him was already shattered . She lay there replaying the past month in her mind , trying to decide if he was even serious . She made a list of events , because lists helped to organize her thoughts . 1 . They had n’t spoken in two years until the play - offs were clinched . 2 . She put on the blue dress , which led to a night of wild sex . 3 . Then he offered to get back together and have a kid . Who does that ? Letting out a groan , Lauren flopped onto her back . Then she let herself wonder what would happen if she actually agreed to his crazy idea . What would he do if she just turned up at the front door of his Brooklyn townhouse with several suitcases and announced she was back ? Lauren snickered to herself . It would almost be worth it to see the startled expression on his face . He ’d always been a shoot - first - and - ask - questions - later kind of guy . It would serve him right . She was the analytical one . The planner . She ’d always told herself that the contrast made them a good fit . He could keep their relationship a little wild and unpredictable . She would keep all the details straight for the both of them . But then he ’d done something utterly unpredictable , and she ’d never gotten over it . There was n’t a spreadsheet in the world effective enough to predict Mike ’s effect on her heart . Her reverie broken , Lauren sat up on the sofa in a hurry . She grabbed her bag off the floor and dug out her very last dose of the fertility medication . It was madness to even ponder his flights of fancy . She had a plan , and she was sticking to it . She took the pill , and then a shower . Then she dug into her e - mail inbox and double - checked Nate ’s travel plans for arriving in Tampa tonight , and verified with the hotel that his room would be ready . Her head was back in the game , and she worked through lunchtime , only glancing up at three P.M. to realize she was starving . She called down to room service to order a salad . A knock came just ten minutes later , and she was impressed by the kitchen ’s promptness . But when she opened the door , it was n’t a salad that was rolled on a cart through her door , but rather a giant arrangement of blue hydrangeas . She ’d never seen anything so large . In fact , it might be an entire hydrangea shrubbery . “
67360	67371	66740	66740	I	91	” she muttered to the porter who had brought it . “
67377	67378	67374	67375	Lauren Williams	114	” “
67381	67382	67374	67375	Lauren Williams	114	” “
67386	67669	67374	67375	Lauren Williams	114	” After he left her the flowers , she opened the note which was taped to the vase . I love you , and I ’ll never stop . — M Her hand paused over the wastepaper basket , where she almost tossed the note in . But then she set it on the desk instead , wondering how everything had become so confusing . TWENTY For the next few days , Beacon set his troubles with Lauren aside the best he could . Given that his team was fighting for its life in the play - offs , he had plenty of other things to worry about . Their veteran forward Beringer was sidelined by shoulder pain that might or might not be something serious . And O’Doul skipped practice for what was rumored to be a stomach bug . Nonetheless , they managed to win game five in Tampa , where Skews was an asshole , but nothing Beacon could n’t handle . Then they flew back to Brooklyn for game six , feeling great . And lost . That left the series tied 3–3 , and required one more trip to Tampa . Taking the series all the way out to game seven meant that everyone was tired . Meanwhile , Detroit beat the Rangers in just five games , so their next potential opponent was resting up and recharging their batteries before the conference final round . By the time they got off the bus at the stadium , every one of Mike ’s teammates wore an intense expression . They marched through the sticky eighty - five degree air and into the subterranean cool of the arena . “
67675	67688	67374	67375	Lauren Williams	114	” Lauren whispered as he caught up to her in the procession . “
67691	67800	67801	67801	You	1309	” They had barely exchanged any words since their odd conversation about baby - making . He ’d gone a little crazy to think that she ’d take him back just like that . But it was one of those situations where he knew if he had n’t at least tried , he ’d always regret it . It had taken all his willpower not to blurt out that he hated the idea of her having someone else ’s baby . Caveman , much ? He took a sidelong glance at Lauren as the team moved through the long hallway . She looked as deflated as he felt . “
67805	67806	67801	67801	You	1309	” “
67810	67815	67816	67816	Ca	226	” she said quickly . “
67824	67842	67816	67816	Ca	226	” Her smile was a little unsteady , though . That was something to worry about later . “
67852	68370	68371	68371	I	91	” She gave him a little salute , and he followed his teammates into the dressing room . • • • Some of Beacon ’s teammates were wildly superstitious . They ate the same sandwich before every game , or tucked lucky charms into their hockey socks . Beacon was n’t very superstitious , but that did n’t mean he could n’t believe in magic . The game seven magic began making appearances even before the puck dropped that night . Doulie felt better , and nobody else came down with the flu . Even better , the MRI on Beringer ’s shoulder had cleared him to play . An hour before the game they gathered on a loading dock to play elimination soccer — the team ’s favorite warm - up . Beacon was the first man out , as usual . He was unaccountably bad at elimination soccer , but it was fun to step out of the circle and watch the rest of them duke it out . Tonight ’s game got down to Doulie and Trevi and Silas , until Silas won it . He often did , too . The only man who never played for the team was the frequent victor of their warm - up game . Go figure . Their good spirits held when the puck dropped , and they went out swinging . So did Tampa , though . It was a weird , high scoring game , tied 4–4 going into overtime . Somehow after all that scoring the overtime period was scoreless . So it went to double overtime . As Mike stretched during the ( fourth ! ) intermission he pictured his daughter in the stands with Hans and Justin , and wondered what Elsa was thinking . We brought it this far , he said to himself . We can take it even a little further . That final period saw the play go a little ragged . But Beacon ’s eyes were n’t as tired as the rest of him . He watched everything . Saw everything . Anticipated everything . Blocked everything . Just when he thought his legs might not make it through another overtime period , Castro got a breakaway on rebound . There was a mad scramble in front of the opponent ’s net before the lamp lit . Even then — because nothing was ever simple — Castro ’s goal was under review . They stood around for two tense minutes while the officials watched the video . And then the scoreboard lit for Brooklyn . They ’d won , and would advance to round three . Smiling and practically sagging with relief , Beacon left the net to hug his teammates . TWENTY - ONE When Lauren reentered the hotel lobby after the game , she found that it had become ground zero for the Bruisers ’ victory party . Players ’ families had taken over the entire lounge area by the fountain . She was surveying the scene when Jimbo trotted up and squeezed her elbow . “
68387	68391	68371	68371	I	91	” he said . “
68400	68401	68392	68392	They	1312	” “
68404	68420	68392	68392	They	1312	” Lauren whipped out her Katt Phone and pulled up the catering manager ’s line . “
68437	68441	68392	68392	They	1312	” she explained . “
68460	68461	68392	68392	They	1312	” “
68464	68468	68392	68392	They	1312	” Jimbo grinned . “
68489	68490	68484	68484	you	1311	” “
68497	68498	68499	68499	I	91	” “
68522	68539	68499	68499	I	91	” Jimbo pointed at an employee poking at a touch - screen terminal beside the bar . “
68543	68547	68548	68548	I	91	” she said . “
68556	68788	68548	68548	I	91	” Lauren ordered several other food items and asked the waiter to set up a table , and to rope off an alcove where they could congregate . Players would be trickling in any moment now , and this melee would n’t be easy for Nate ’s security team to handle . Sure enough , Castro and Beringer arrived a moment later to cheers . Lauren stationed Jimbo at the entrance to the alcove and asked him to keep an eye on things until the bus arrived with the rest of the team . Lauren flitted about , checking on the status of the transport vehicles and taking care of business . Everyone was smiling and jubilant , yet she fought off an unhappy void right in the middle of her chest . This morning Lauren had taken an ovulation test . It was your basic pee - on - a - stick situation , and performed in the privacy of her hotel room . A minute after executing this maneuver , the digital readout showed her a smiley face . She ’d been wearing a frowny face ever since . A frantic call to the fertility clinic had confirmed what she already suspected — they would n’t perform her insemination two days from now when she was back in New York , because it was n’t likely enough to work . “
68799	68805	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” the nurse pointed out . “
68821	68960	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” But I ’m tired of waiting , Lauren complained to herself . Now that she ’d made the big decision to become a mother , she wanted to get on with it . And even worse — next month this same scenario might just play out again . The road to the Stanley Cup finals could potentially stretch out another fourteen games , each one two or three days apart . It could be mid - June before the kings were crowned . If her boys survived this next series , and if Becca was still out of commission , she might miss another date with the clinic . The room began to fill with players and even more of their loved ones . She saw Jimbo admit a couple of team alumni , too , including Dan “
68962	68974	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” Chancer and his evil troll of a wife . Great . “
68978	68998	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” Lauren spun around to find Mike standing nearby with four champagne glasses and a magnum in his hand . “
69001	69041	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” she said , momentarily stalled by the happy look in his eye , and the dazzling effect of Mike Beacon in a suit , his shirt collar open at the neck , his tie stuffed into a pocket . “
69046	69047	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” “
69050	69054	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” He winked . “
69067	69068	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” “
69077	69090	68789	68789	Nobody	1886	” she joked . He pursed his lips and shook his head . “
69109	69120	69096	69096	You	1318	” He held out the hand with all the glasses . “
69137	69182	69129	69129	I	91	” Lauren almost refused . She ’d given up alcohol this past week on account of her potential pregnancy . Now she realized it did n’t matter if she had a glass of champagne . Swallowing roughly , she slipped one from his fingers . “
69185	69204	69205	69205	Hans	120	” He poured , and she was all too conscious of how close to one another they were . “
69207	69221	69222	69222	I	91	” Mike called , lifting his chin toward the blond man standing nearby . “
69226	69260	69222	69222	I	91	” The guy came closer , and Lauren realized where she ’d seen him before — the airport . And sure enough , Hans was followed by Elsa and another man , too . “
69265	69279	69222	69222	I	91	” Elsa sang , pointing at the bottle in her father ’s hand . “
69284	69285	69222	69222	I	91	” “
69294	69302	69286	69286	You	1319	” he said , pouring another glass . “
69321	69330	69306	69306	Hans	120	” He gave the man a warm smile . “
69343	69354	69355	69355	Hans	120	” The blond cutie blushed , and took the glass . “
69364	69365	69361	69362	Lauren Williams	114	” “
69373	69377	69383	69383	Elsa	2199	” she said . “
69393	69433	69385	69385	I	91	” She waited to see what the girl would find to say . The poor thing had never been able to tolerate Lauren , but Lauren was n’t about to take it personally . The kid had her reasons . “
69436	69441	69385	69385	I	91	” she said stiffly . “
69452	69458	69460	69460	you	120	” The compliment startled Lauren . “
69462	69463	69464	69465	My granny	481	” “
69472	69484	69486	69486	she	481	” Elsa added . Then she smiled like the Cheshire Cat . “
69489	69567	69486	69486	she	481	” Well played , sister . Lauren bit her lip against a bark of frustrated laughter . Behind Elsa , Hans the babysitter looked mortified . And Mike gave his daughter a stern look that said , We ’ll talk later . Looking pleased with herself , Elsa took Hans ’s champagne glass out of his hand and took a taste . Then Hans snatched it back . They obviously had their hands full with this kid . “
69572	69595	69570	69570	Justin	122	” Mike said a beat later , handing a glass of champagne to a redheaded guy on the edge of their group . “
69604	69629	69570	69570	Justin	122	” He poured a glass of bubbly for himself . Elsa tried to take it , but he held it out of her reach . “
69634	69701	69570	69570	Justin	122	” he said , and she could swear it had more than one meaning . Lauren shook hands with Justin and made a couple of minutes of small talk with Mike ’s crew . She learned that Hans was Elsa ’s violin teacher , and that springtime was — in addition to play - offs season — the season when classical musicians auditioned for symphony jobs . “
69708	69717	69570	69570	Justin	122	” he said in a slightly clipped accent . “
69745	69746	69733	69733	Elsa	2199	” “
69751	69755	69733	69733	Elsa	2199	” she sympathized . “
69764	69943	69733	69733	Elsa	2199	” Justin said , wrapping an arm around Hans . Hans smiled again . The two of them were adorable . Even so , Lauren made her excuses . She thanked Mike for the glass of bubbly and made noises about checking to see that every player had made it back from the arena . There was really no more work to do tonight . The team had done it all themselves , and had earned themselves a trip to the conference finals next week . She finished her champagne and abandoned the empty glass on a table . It was time for her to head upstairs . As she wove through the bodies toward freedom , Lauren spotted the bald head of an infant in the crowd . And when she looked over its little round head , she found that it was held in one burly arm by the young forward Castro . She maneuvered closer for a better view . There was nothing sexier than a hunk of a guy holding a chubby little baby . “
69950	69956	69959	69959	Lauren	114	” she asked the player . “
69971	69972	69968	69968	he	1325	” “
69976	70005	70009	70009	him	1325	” Lauren agreed . The baby had the smoothest dark - gold skin , and little starfish hands , one of which he jammed into his drooling mouth . “
70011	70012	70007	70007	I	91	” “
70018	70028	70029	70029	I	91	” Castro said , passing her the baby immediately . “
70048	70049	70050	70050	Hi	220	” “
70052	70064	70050	70050	Hi	220	” Lauren cooed to the warm bundle landing in her arms . “
70072	70073	70074	70074	Xavier	245	” “
70076	70080	70074	70074	Xavier	245	” Castro supplied . “
70093	70147	70150	70150	man	533	” The baby looked up at her with wide eyes , as if trying to decide . She used the pad of her thumb to stroke just under his soft little chin , and then he made up his mind . He opened his mouth and gave her a giant , toothless smile . “
70159	70167	70154	70154	he	533	” Castro said . So was Lauren . “
70175	70203	70168	70168	You	220	” she said to the baby in a low voice . Lauren loved babies , yet they did n’t inspire her to speak in a high voice . “
70209	70210	70206	70206	your	220	” “
70213	70218	70206	70206	your	220	” Castro said quickly . “
70225	70262	70206	70206	your	220	” But Lauren was n’t worried . It was n’t , as a matter of fact , one of her prettiest outfits . Elsa had pointed that out rather harshly , but it was half true . “
70282	70298	70299	70299	Dude	139	” He jammed one chubby fist into his mouth and seemed to agree with her . “
70317	70335	70338	70338	Jackie	246	” A woman with Castro ’s coloring and a cheerful smile punched her brother in the biceps . “
70340	70359	70360	70360	Lauren	114	” she said to Lauren while Castro rubbed the spot on his arm that his sister had punished . “
70362	70386	70338	70338	Jackie	246	” she said , smiling at Jackie , who wore an empty baby sling over her dress and munched on a carrot stick . “
70394	70395	70338	70338	Jackie	246	” “
70433	70434	70435	70435	I	91	” “
70440	70444	70435	70435	I	91	” Castro sniffed . “
70455	70456	70452	70452	Lauren	114	” “
70467	70471	70472	70472	He	1329	” Jackie teased . “
70475	70479	70472	70472	He	1329	” Lauren lied . “
70506	70507	70508	70508	She	1332	” “
70512	70521	70522	70523	The baby	106	” a big , brassy voice cut in . “
70547	70575	70576	70576	Miranda	247	” Lauren ’s face began to flame even before she heard other conversations stop around them . Embarrassed , she lifted her chin and squared her shoulders . “
70578	70583	70576	70576	Miranda	247	” Lauren said icily . “
70594	70640	70576	70576	Miranda	247	” She gave her old adversary the once - over . The woman was draped in diamonds , because her husband had had a good run in the NHL before he retired from the team last year . Miranda Chancer tossed her hair and grinned . “
70643	70650	70576	70576	Miranda	247	” she said with a chuckle . “
70657	70658	70576	70576	Miranda	247	” “
70663	70685	70686	70686	I	91	” Lauren said , easing little Xavier back into his mother ’s arms , because her hands had begun to shake . “
70709	70753	70697	70697	I	91	” In the dreadful silence which followed , Lauren turned away , her heart racing . She took three steps toward the elevator banks , but someone squeezed her elbow . Hyped up on adrenaline , she whirled toward her captor . Mike . “
70756	70760	70761	70761	God	114	” he said . “
70773	70781	70782	70782	I	91	” She did n’t let him finish . “
70786	71140	71144	71144	Lo	1597	” She jerked her arm out of his grasp and made her escape . He followed her , but Lauren was fast . She made it into an elevator , and as the doors slid closed she saw him halt , his worried face studying her as she disappeared . Lauren felt a hot slap of shame for sinking to Miranda Chancer ’s level . She ’d delivered an artless insult — even less clever than the one a thirteen - year - old had delivered only moments earlier . And , hell . At least Elsa had a shot at growing out of such uncouth behavior . Damn it . She ’d lost her cool , and right in front of the team . And Mike . As the elevator slid higher , she wondered how much he ’d heard , and whether he ’d seen her fawning over that baby , too . Life was simpler five weeks ago when he was n’t around all the time . Please , Lord , she prayed . Let them win this next round in five ? I ’m trying to move on , here . But I need your help . An hour later she ’d managed to relax . This was accomplished via the overpriced single - serving bottle of cabernet she ’d removed from the minibar , and the spread of magazines across her lap . The television was tuned to a singing competition of some kind . It was n’t interesting but the laughter made her feel less alone . She heard a rapping sound , like someone knocking on the door . Lauren muted the TV to see if it would repeat . It did . With a sigh , she tiptoed into the suite ’s living room and crept closer to the peephole . Since her phone was off , she had no idea if Nate was looking for her . It was n’t Nate . Lauren froze there and waited for Mike Beacon to give up and retreat back down the hall . But he knocked again . “
71168	71172	71144	71144	Lo	1597	” Damn him . “
71179	71186	71187	71187	I	91	” she said through the door . “
71202	71216	71187	71187	I	91	” Miranda ? Elsa ? Abandonment ? He could really take his pick . “
71223	71227	71187	71187	I	91	” He chuckled . “
71242	71293	71235	71235	I	91	” She closed her eyes and clenched her fists against the urge to open the door . But he was right there on the other side , asking to come in . Was there any chance she was about to send him away ? Something went thunk against the door . “
71298	71302	71303	71303	My	91	” she asked . “
71306	71307	71303	71303	My	91	” “
71312	71313	71303	71303	My	91	” “
71322	71340	71320	71320	you	1335	” Somehow those were the magic words . She reached for the door knob and opened it . “
71346	71350	71320	71320	you	1335	” He chuckled . “
71362	71399	71400	71400	I	91	” She tried on that idea in her head . I was hoping to be pregnant right now , so I shamed Chancey ’s wife . Nope . That sounded too crazy to say out loud . “
71434	71437	71431	71431	I	91	” Again . “
71446	71458	71431	71431	I	91	” he said , tossing his tie onto the coffee table . “
71464	71515	71516	71516	I	91	” She pointed at the bedroom . He shrugged off his jacket and kicked off his shoes . Then he went to sit on the bed . She watched as he grabbed the clicker and unmuted the TV , where a man ’s voice began to belt out Gloria Gaynor ’s “
71520	71526	71516	71516	I	91	” Mike made a face . “
71538	71611	71527	71527	He	1336	” For a second she was just frozen there on the carpet , trying to wrap her head around this moment . It might have been any night from the happiest year of her life . The TV on . Idle chatter . Mike looking pleasantly weary from one game or another . It was like traveling backward in time . She had to work to unstick herself and walk toward him . “
71620	71621	71527	71527	He	1336	” “
71626	71682	71527	71527	He	1336	” Another knife to the heart . He used to say that all the time . She fetched him a bottle of Dos Equis , opened the top and brought it to him . With her wineglass in her hand , she climbed carefully onto the other side of the bed and sat beside him . “
71688	71701	71702	71702	They	1339	” she asked , watching the singer strut around on the stage . “
71707	71723	71702	71702	They	1339	” She gave him a sidelong glance , wondering what he expected to happen now . “
71730	71751	71702	71702	They	1339	” she blurted out . His eyes did n’t leave the screen , but he covered her hand with his . “
71754	71755	71756	71756	I	91	” “
71763	71770	71756	71756	I	91	” His chin whipped toward hers . “
71773	71774	71756	71756	I	91	” “
71777	71797	71756	71756	I	91	” she said , her voice almost inaudible . He gave a sexy little growl and shifted his hips . “
71815	71873	71807	71808	the doctor	2253	” Lauren shivered slightly . She grabbed the clicker and bumped up the volume on the TV . He let her have the distraction for a moment . But then his thumb began to slowly stroke her wrist . That jerk . He knew she ’d have trouble resisting his caresses . She pulled her hand back . “
71882	71883	71807	71808	the doctor	2253	” “
71895	71896	71807	71808	the doctor	2253	” “
71931	71942	71924	71924	I	91	” Now he turned to look her in the eye . “
71952	71983	71984	71984	You	1341	” Busted . It had been hard to think of anything else , but she did n’t admit it . She just held his gaze . Mike looked away first . “
72009	72143	72004	72004	I	91	” He took a swig of his beer , and a different singer waltzed onto the stage to a round of applause . Lauren tried to watch the show . But his nearness was the mother of all distractions . And he took her hand again . A couple of minutes later he dragged a roughened finger up the sensitive skin at the inside of her forearm . When he reached her inner elbow , she stopped breathing . And when he lifted her palm to his lips , she bit the inside of her cheek . The new singer was , if possible , worse than the first . She had a warbly voice and she ’d chosen an old jazz standard that deserved better . Mike let out a giant groan . “
72148	72166	72004	72004	I	91	” Lauren asked , her voice a little rougher than it had been a few minutes ago . “
72187	72188	72004	72004	I	91	” “
72197	72209	72004	72004	I	91	” she said with as much nonchalance as she could summon . “
72228	72229	72230	72230	Mike	2343	” “
72236	72270	72271	72271	Mike	2343	” He looked at his watch , and then back at the screen . When approximately one minute had passed , he muted the show , then leaned in and kissed her neck . “
72273	72304	72271	72271	Mike	2343	” she warned . His lips moved sensuously down her neck , dropping soft kisses . His beard tickled her collarbone and the shiver that resulted seemed to vibrate everywhere . “
72312	72402	72403	72403	I	91	” He tongued her earlobe , then sucked it into his mouth . She did n’t want to send him home — not when he was making love to the sensitive patch of skin beneath her ear . Her hands found their way onto his chest . He covered them with one of his and then his mouth covered hers , hot and determined . With a moan , she opened for him . Their tongues met and melded . Mike : 1 , self - control : 0 . “
72407	72417	72405	72405	you	91	” he grunted , rolling on top of her . “
72423	72543	72405	72405	you	91	” With his tongue in her mouth , it was hard to argue the point . Everything was heat and motion . She let herself be stoked like a campfire . Using his tongue and his very skilled hands , he built her into a raging , crackling flame . He tugged at her clothes , and she was too pliant to care as they were stripped away piece by piece , along with his . Skin to skin , they kissed until her lips were swollen and her heart held nothing but willingness and desire . He whispered sweet words into her ear as his thick fingers slid down her body and into the juncture of her thighs . “
72551	72576	72577	72577	Lauren	114	” he rasped against her lips . She tugged his head closer and kissed him again . More action , please . Less talking . “
72579	72609	72577	72577	Lauren	114	” he said gently . He was straddling her , his cockhead teasing her clit . He was poised on his elbows above her body , dark eyes glittering . “
72619	72665	72666	72666	Lo	1597	” Did she ? She considered the question while he plundered her mouth with another knee - melting kiss . She was throbbing , her legs splayed open , her heart whirling . This , her body chanted . This . And more of this . “
72668	72678	72666	72666	Lo	1597	” he pressed , his fingers stroking her mercilessly . “
72695	72742	72693	72693	Condom	251	” Slowly , she shook her head . He gave her the hottest smile she ’d ever seen . Then he grabbed both her hands and pressed them against the bed . But when he pushed inside , his cocky grin slid right off his face . “
72755	72779	72780	72780	Lo	1597	” She could n’t comment because she was too busy climaxing . Pleasure ripped through her body unexpectedly . She whimpered and shook . “
72782	72928	72780	72780	Lo	1597	” he groaned , his hips driving forward . He took her mouth in another hungry kiss . Pinned to the bed like a butterfly to a board , she let out a husky moan . This was the stuff of her fantasies . It was reckless and unexpected , and that made it even sweeter . Skin to skin , each new sensation was bright and overwhelming . Above her , he made the soul - deep sounds of a man in love . She sensed a third presence in the room — there was Mike and Lauren , and also their union . Their closeness was back , gasping to life , shimmying between them . It was n’t long before she felt her joy building again . Breaking off their kiss , she jammed her face against his neck and cried out . “
72933	72979	72780	72780	Lo	1597	” he groaned . Then , with a shout , he planted himself one more time . When his body relaxed against hers a moment later , nobody spoke . Theirs was a sweet silence , broken only by the sound of their mingled panting . “
72982	73095	73096	73096	You	1349	” he croaked . She did see . Even if she was still too blissed out to articulate it , she knew what he meant . What they ’d just done was n’t a spark of recklessness , but a force of nature . Like gravity . You could leap away from it , but it always pulled you back . Their connection was still there , even if it had lain dormant a long time . Lauren had watched people search their whole lives for the One , and hers was currently on top of her . She was n’t going to argue with him . Yet she might tease him . “
73104	73105	73102	73102	you	1349	” “
73112	73113	73102	73102	you	1349	” “
73120	73121	73122	73122	I	91	” “
73163	73174	73154	73161	a girl just by chewing on your neck	1352	” She shivered without meaning to , and he chuckled . “
73177	73197	73200	73200	Lo	1597	” He dipped down to kiss her collarbone again , and he gave his hips one more slow pump . “
73202	73207	73200	73200	Lo	1597	” he added eventually . “
73221	73224	73216	73216	twins	1353	” Triplets ? “
73229	73277	73278	73278	I	91	” He laughed , but she was n’t ready to think about the consequences . Later , when she was alone , there would be time to panic about the future , and whether they could work things out for good . He chuckled into her hair . “
73285	73286	73278	73278	I	91	” “
73291	73322	73287	73287	I	91	” she muttered . They were still joined , and she gave him a little shove to get off her . But he caught her hands and kissed her again . “
73333	73349	73287	73287	I	91	” Given what they ’d just done , he might turn out to be right . “
73356	73360	73287	73287	I	91	” he whispered . “
73368	73372	73373	73373	You	1351	” Was it ? “
73377	73382	73373	73373	You	1351	” she reminded him . “
73387	73393	73373	73373	You	1351	” He kissed her nose . “
73403	73404	73398	73398	I	91	” “
73411	73452	73398	73398	I	91	” With a sexy groan , he removed himself from her body , and she padded into the bathroom for a little cleanup . When she emerged a couple of minutes later , he was still lounging in her bed . “
73456	73500	73398	73398	I	91	” he demanded . She sat on the edge of the bed , trying to wrap her head around what had happened here tonight . The results were potentially life - changing . Mike tugged her hand until she turned to face him . “
73521	73531	73516	73516	I	91	” He pulled her down onto his spectacular body . “
73561	73562	73563	73563	I	91	” “
73569	73588	73563	73563	I	91	” she insisted . She curled one hand around his scruffy jaw and kissed him to prove it . “
73606	73610	73602	73602	Elsa	2199	” He grinned . “
73635	73646	73623	73623	she	2199	” He dropped a row of kisses along her jawline . “
73667	73782	73654	73654	I	91	” She wrapped her arms around him and accepted his kisses . There was no way to worry about the future when she had the love of her life in her arms , his hard body pressed against her own . It was late now , but neither of them was sleepy . They kissed until their lips were swollen , and his erection was a hot brand against her belly again . He dipped his head and caught her breast in his mouth . As he sucked , she felt her body calling to him again . He released her breast with a wet pop and went to work on the other side . “
73788	73794	73654	73654	I	91	” he said between kisses , “
73803	73813	73654	73654	I	91	” Then he ran a hand down her belly . “
73836	73851	73821	73821	I	91	” She moaned and squeezed her legs together against the slickness she felt there . “
73857	73896	73821	73821	I	91	” he said . She let herself be arranged on her hip , both legs bent . Mike lifted her top knee and maneuvered his hips into place . He filled her again , and they both moaned . “
73905	73914	73915	73915	One	2200	” he said as he began to move . “
73921	73947	73948	73948	You	1359	” His arm came around her waist , and he took hold of her breast in his hand , rolling the nipple until she whimpered . “
73952	73973	73948	73948	You	1359	” She did . He nudged her again , rolling her farther until she was propped onto elbows and knees . “
73982	73989	73974	73974	We	1361	” he rasped into her ear . “
73995	74079	74083	74083	sweetheart	1078	” As he picked up the pace , she pressed her forehead into the pillow and just took it . Every stroke made her feel happier than the last . In the two years since they were a couple she ’d had a couple of flings just to prove she could . Every one of them had been entirely forgettable . Nobody else had ever . . . how did Mike put it ? Turned her into a needy puddle of a girl . “
74085	74091	74083	74083	sweetheart	1078	” he rasped behind her . “
74102	74135	74083	74083	sweetheart	1078	” His words had her hovering on the edge . And then when he slid a hand under her body and fingered their connection , she could n’t hold back any longer . “
74139	74178	74083	74083	sweetheart	1078	” he said as she began to gasp . Then he moaned and shuddered against her back . A moment later they were pancaked onto the bed , and Mike began to laugh , shaking her beneath him . “
74187	74191	74183	74183	I	91	” he said . “
74195	74310	74311	74311	You	1363	” With a groan , he rolled to the side . Lauren lay facedown a moment longer , not quite ready to look him in the eye . She ’d really missed this . It was n’t just the energetic sex — and they used to have plenty — but also the intimacy . All week long at work she wore suits and wrote the persuasive missives that helped power Nate ’s global empire . She maintained her own apartment and made all her own decisions . But sometimes a girl just needed to be spread out on the bed and properly fucked . He ’d always been just the man for the job . “
74314	74319	74311	74311	You	1363	” he asked eventually . “
74323	74345	74346	74346	I	91	” she slurred , too happy and spent to elaborate . Chuckling , he curled his body around hers and sighed . “
74366	74367	74354	74354	You	1363	” “
74370	74600	74354	74354	You	1363	” she whispered , snuggling closer . She fell asleep to the sound of his breaths evening out beside her . TWENTY - TWO NEW YORK , NEW YORK MAY 2016 All the way home from Florida , Lauren felt pregnant with a secret , if not necessarily with a baby . She sat with Mike and his teammates in the airport ’s charter terminal on Saturday morning , sipping coffee and listening to the players ’ smack talk . They all looked a little bleary from partying . Except for Mike , who just looked happy . He gave her a secretive smile every time their gazes met . She felt those smiles like a soft breeze against her skin . She stared out the window on the way home , thinking optimistic , sexy thoughts . On Sunday evening , Lauren received an unexpected delivery from Eli ’s , an upscale gourmet food store on the Upper East Side . It arrived in a small cooler with a shoulder strap , which was completely odd . After she verified that the delivery was actually for her ( from one Mike Beacon ) and tipped the delivery man , she unzipped her gift . Pickles and chocolate ice cream . She groaned , and then laughed . The text she sent him was only a few words long . “
74610	74611	74606	74606	yourself	1364	” “
74621	74622	74617	74617	I	91	” “
74627	74907	74908	74908	Lauren	114	” is all she replied . Many couples took a year or more to get pregnant . And when Lauren tried to picture herself a year from now in a relationship with Mike , it was n’t easy to do . When they were together before , she ’d been a planner — she’d allowed herself to picture the future . Then he ’d blown up their life together , and for two years every thought of him caused her almost physical pain . So picturing the future again ? It could wait . She did however sample the ice cream he ’d sent . It was excellent . When she woke up on Monday morning , her Katt Phone was glowing red around the edges , indicating an urgent message . Someone is showing us an offer on the router division , Nate had texted . Need you in Manhattan today . The text gave her an honest - to - god shiver of excitement . Forty minutes later she was skidding toward the security turnstiles in the lobby of the office building . She passed her ID over the laser eye and heard the satisfying beep which indicated she was still employed by one the coolest companies on the planet . Given her month - long absence , her desk on the thirty - seventh floor was n’t as big a disaster as she ’d expected . Her little team had done a good job keeping the place running smoothly while she was pinch - hitting in Brooklyn . At eight A.M. a phalanx of investment bankers arrived to brief Nate on the offer they were receiving . “
74910	74922	74908	74908	Lauren	114	” Nate said , breezing in just before the meeting began . “
74931	74932	74923	74923	I	91	” “
74936	74960	74961	74961	I	91	” she said , a little surprised by this demand . She usually ran his office from outside the closed - door meetings . “
74995	75011	75012	75012	Everyone	255	” She grabbed a notepad and stood immediately and followed him into the conference room . “
75018	75221	75012	75012	Everyone	255	” a banker said at first , handing over a form for her to sign . Since Lauren was part of Nate ’s inner circle , she ’d signed dozens of these already , promising not to reveal the terms of various potential transactions . The meeting lasted two hours as the bankers described the terms by which a company called iBits desired to acquire Nate ’s router business . It was n’t an ordinary purchase though . iBits wanted contracts for a ten - year relationship between the division and Kattenberger Technologies whereby Nate would continue to license his software to the company . Lauren tried to guess which of his tech executives he ’d need to meet with later today , and she scribbled pages of notes while the bankers delivered their specs . After they left , Nate ’s chief technology officer ran off to arrange for various engineers to attend a one o’clock meeting where they discussed the technical aspects of the relationship , while Lauren asked one of her minions to order sushi for her and Nate so they would n’t starve to death while they scrambled to assemble all the specialists required to analyze the offer . “
75229	75256	75012	75012	Everyone	255	” Nate said when they were alone in the conference room . He kicked his sneakers onto the polished table and leaned back in his chair . “
75259	75263	75012	75012	Everyone	255	” Lauren hedged . “
75274	75296	75297	75297	Me	91	” He looked up in surprise , because she did n’t usually volunteer that sort of opinion on a business matter . “
75308	75408	75304	75304	yours	1370	” There was a certain giddiness she felt when some new development at work made them all scramble around , trying to make the most of it . It fizzed in her veins as she sat on one of Nate ’s couches . She ’d been wondering how it might be possible to transition from office manager to something more . That ’s why she ’d worked so hard to get a degree , right ? As she leaned forward to tell Nate what she thought of the iBits offer , moving up in his organization suddenly seemed possible . “
75430	75431	75304	75304	yours	1370	” “
75434	75445	75304	75304	yours	1370	” he said , tucking his hands behind his head . “
75456	75473	75474	75474	I	91	” They exchanged notes right through lunch , until Nate had to depart for another meeting . “
75495	75499	75484	75484	we	1374	” he said . “
75503	75508	75484	75484	we	1374	” she said quickly . “
75531	75532	75522	75522	I	91	” “
75535	75562	75522	75522	I	91	” she said , startled . This was finally it — a return to normal . She ’d been waiting for this moment for five weeks . “
75569	75607	75608	75608	She	357	” Lauren should be jumping up and down right now . So why was n’t she ? Because the team would start the third round tomorrow night , and she would n’t be there to see it . “
75615	75620	75621	75621	She	357	” Nate said slowly . “
75646	75647	75641	75641	she	357	” “
75651	75708	75641	75641	she	357	” Lauren said , having no idea if it really was . She was too busy scrutinizing Nate ’s face for more clues about the Becca situation . As usual , he revealed nothing . Working for the world ’s most stoic human was n’t easy . Then she forgot all about Becca because Nate said , “
75730	75731	75723	75723	I	91	” “
75734	75739	75723	75723	I	91	” she said immediately . “
75773	75774	75764	75764	you	1377	” “
75881	75882	75870	75870	Nobody	1886	” “
75889	75947	75948	75948	I	91	” she said . A dozen ideas bloomed in her mind at once . What did iBits sound like on social media ? When people left the firm , where did they go ? What was their maternity leave policy ? That last question was a little gift from her subconscious . She pushed the thought away . “
75953	76082	76083	76083	Alex	173	” she told her boss . • • • The next night Lauren was still in the office at ten P.M. Earlier she ’d turned in her full report on iBits to Nate . Then she ’d taken a break to go to the gym and pick up some dinner for herself and her boss . The two of them had tuned in to watch the Bruisers defeat Detroit in the first game of the Conference Finals series . Now they were sitting on opposite sofas in his office , empty Diet Coke cans strewn about . They ’d spent two very long days getting their heads around iBits and its offer . This morning , Nate ’s friend Alex had called with her own offer , too . “
76090	76101	76083	76083	Alex	173	” he grunted now , his hands behind his head . “
76114	76115	76103	76103	her	1385	” “
76134	76139	76125	76125	Alex	173	” Lauren pointed out . “
76142	76146	76147	76147	I	91	” Nate laughed . “
76169	76170	76171	76171	My	91	” “
76174	76182	76171	76171	My	91	” He turned to look at her . “
76191	76197	76171	76171	My	91	” Lauren felt herself fading . “
76211	76215	76203	76203	Nate	91	” He grinned . “
76242	76332	76333	76334	This company	1379	” She made a noncommittal noise . She ’d been approached by recruiters for several companies . But leaving Kattenberger Technologies was n’t on Lauren ’s to - do list . If she was going to become a new mother , she wanted to do that while employed by someone who would make certain accommodations to keep her . A girl could n’t tell her brand - new employer that she was completely unwilling to travel . It was n’t time yet to explain this to Nate , though . “
76344	76349	76333	76334	This company	1379	” she said instead . “
76366	76380	76333	76334	This company	1379	” He shrugged as if thirty - thousand dollars was of little consequence . “
76414	76415	76407	76407	you	1390	” “
76418	76422	76407	76407	you	1390	” No problem . “
76432	76437	76423	76423	I	91	” he went on . “
76460	76461	76462	76462	You	1390	” “
76465	76482	76462	76462	You	1390	” It had n’t occurred to her that Nate would brainstorm her career path for her . “
76523	76532	76513	76513	I	91	” Lauren sat up straighter on the sofa . “
76540	76541	76542	76542	I	91	” “
76555	76570	76571	76571	I	91	” He took off his reading glasses and stowed them in a shirt pocket . “
76634	76635	76636	76636	I	91	” “
76639	76661	76636	76636	I	91	” Lauren said slowly , her mind whirling . California ? She really was n’t looking to move out of state . “
76675	76696	76697	76697	You	1390	” Vice president . She could be a VP in Nate ’s company ? Really ? Nate rubbed his eyes . “
76715	76716	76706	76706	we	1395	” “
76719	76736	76706	76706	we	1395	” But she ’d be picturing the words vice president on her business card until then . “
76757	76766	76770	76770	Nate	91	” Laughing , she gathered her papers together . “
76772	76773	76770	76770	Nate	91	” “
76776	77320	76770	76770	Nate	91	” TWENTY - THREE Mike : Hi there . Lauren : Hi yourself . Mike : I looked for you on the jet to Motor City . Lauren : I was n’t on the jet . Mike : Eventually I figured that out . Lauren : Good . A goalie needs sharp eyes . Mike : I looked for you at yoga and at lunch . And by the rooftop pool . Then I flexed my muscles at the sweet young thing at the front desk and tried to pry your room number out of her . Lauren : And it did n’t work ? Mike : Sure it did . But she said you were n’t staying here . Lauren : She was just blowing you off . Mike : Really ? You ’re here ? Lauren : No . Just pulling your chain . :) Mike : So why are you not here ? We need to work on our project together . :) Lauren : I ’m working on Nate ’s project . Mike : ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? Lauren : Let me clarify — it ’s a different kind of project . Mike : What kind ? Lauren : Something came up at KTech , and Nate needs me here this week . Ca n’t say what , though . Not being coy . I signed an NDA . Mike : You must be very important . Lauren : The importantest . Ask anyone . Mike : If you were here , I ’d remove all your clothes and make you tell me all the secrets . Lauren : If I was there , I ’d probably let you . You ’re very persuasive . Lauren : Crap . I should n’t joke like this on the Katt Phone . I WOULDN’T REALLY TELL . KIDDING , BOSS . Mike : You think he has all your texts scanned for potential espionage ? Lauren : No idea if the bots we always joke about are real . But either way , I ’m one of the most dedicated , hardworking employees of the world ’s best company ; it ’s important the bots do n’t get the wrong idea . :) Mike : You are very persuasive , too . I wonder if my texts are also scanned . I probably should n’t text you what I ’ve been thinking about . Lauren : Right . Mike : The bots might like a thrill , though . I ’m lying in my hotel bed , wishing you were here with me . I feel like nibbling on your thighs a little . For an appetizer . Then I want to dine on the main course . Slowly . Lauren : Wowzers . I hope the bots are taking a night off . Mike : Oh , relax . Innuendo wo n’t summon the bots . That probably requires dirty words . IE I want to lick your pussy until you ’re dripping for me . Then I want you to ride my cock until I explode inside you . Mike ’s Katt Phone rang in his hand , and he swiped to answer it . “

77451	77472	77446	77446	I	91	” she said , her voice low and serious . They shared a moment of companionable silence before he asked , “
77481	77497	77476	77476	you	1400	” He felt her huff of laughter as if she were right there with him . “

77534	77552	77529	77529	we	1401	” He shifted his hips again just to feel the silky cotton sheets slide against his erection . “

77763	77764	77765	77765	Mike	2343	” “
77773	77774	77765	77765	Mike	2343	” “
77780	77827	77777	77777	I	91	” he pressed , grinning into the phone . God , there was nothing better than lying here in the dark , Lauren in his ear . Unless it was Lauren naked in his arms . That would be better , come to think of it . “
77838	77839	77777	77777	I	91	” “
77844	77848	77777	77777	I	91	” he teased . “
77868	77869	77873	77873	babies	2685	” “
77882	77883	77873	77873	babies	2685	” “
77887	77892	77873	77873	babies	2685	” he said easily . “
77911	77912	77913	77913	I	91	” “
77924	77925	77913	77913	I	91	” “
77934	77935	77913	77913	I	91	” “
77942	77943	77936	77936	You	106	” “
77951	77989	77936	77936	You	106	” • • • As it happened , he did shut out Detroit . The team flew home with 2–0 on the series so far , and a two - game home ice advantage coming their way . “
77995	78100	77936	77936	You	106	” the sports pages had all screamed . It felt pretty damn good , too . The Bruisers had already exceeded the media ’s expectations . And Lauren told him that season ticket sales were already up for next year , so Nate was feeling great . The only bad news was that Coach Worthington called a working dinner for Friday night . One of his old friends used to work with several key Detroit players , so Coach had the man in for a long strategy session and video viewing . He had to cancel his first date with Lauren in two years . “
78103	78107	77936	77936	You	106	” he begged . “
78122	78123	77936	77936	You	106	” “
78138	78142	78133	78133	Silas	402	” she teased . “
78155	78196	78197	78197	Dad	372	” They did n’t , though . Game three was beset by bad luck and some bad calls from the ref . They lost it in overtime , 2–1 . Luckily , Lauren was willing to dine with him anyway . “
78199	78217	78197	78197	Dad	372	” Elsa asked , coming down the stairs as he straightened up the living room that night . “
78220	78237	78197	78197	Dad	372	” Mike gathered some old issues of Sports Illustrated into a stack and straightened the corners . “
78247	78250	78197	78197	Dad	372	” Busted . “
78256	78257	78197	78197	Dad	372	” “
78260	78261	78197	78197	Dad	372	” “
78275	78300	78197	78197	Dad	372	” Hans had found someone reliable to come in to clean once a week , but she was n’t due for three more days . “
78305	78309	78310	78310	Lauren	114	” Truth time . “
78326	78335	78310	78310	Lauren	114	” He stood up and faced his daughter . “
78342	78360	78310	78310	Lauren	114	” Elsa wrinkled her nose the same way she used to do when Shelly served brussels sprouts . “
78363	78364	78365	78365	You	91	” “
78374	78375	78365	78365	You	91	” “
78381	78397	78365	78365	You	91	” she droned . He picked up an empty water bottle and a crumpled napkin . “
78410	78411	78365	78365	You	91	” “
78414	78425	78365	78365	You	91	” She turned around and beat feet toward the stairs . “
78436	78437	78365	78365	You	91	” “
78443	78700	78441	78441	yours	91	” he said slowly , wondering if he should try harder to include her this evening . They ’d hung out for a couple hours yesterday , watching a movie together during the resting hours before his game . And since today was Sunday , they ’d had brunch before he ’d had to go to the practice facility for a quick goal - coaching session . But he ’d been home for hours now . He ’d have to fly back to Detroit on Wednesday , though that was still three days away . During the play - offs , he was always an absent father . But when Elsa got out of school he ’d have a month of free time with her . How many dads had that ? Dinner with Lauren would take an hour , tops . And an hour alone with Lauren was something they both needed . It had now been ten days since they ’d been together in Tampa . Ten days of only texts and phone calls . He was dying to hold her . So here he was , straightening the living room and then heading into the kitchen to sweep crumbs off the countertops . When the doorbell rang at six thirty , his heart leapt like a school boy ’s . He trotted over to the front door and opened it to reveal Lauren standing on his stoop in a bright pink trench coat and pearls , wearing a shy expression on her face . “
78703	78711	78441	78441	yours	91	” he said , his smile spreading . “
78714	78723	78441	78441	yours	91	” she said , her own smile tentative . “
78728	78737	78441	78441	yours	91	” He stepped aside to let her pass . “
78758	78884	78887	78887	you	1409	” He sounded oddly formal to his own ears . So after she handed over her raincoat , he tossed it over the arm of the sofa . Then he backed her up against the front door and kissed her hungrily . Her lips were warm , and her body was soft beneath his . Startled hands flew to his back , but then they welcomed him in . She made a throaty little noise as her mouth softened beneath his . Jesus . He had the urge to carry her up two flights of stairs and throw her on the bed . If they were home alone right now , he ’d probably do it . With a quiet groan , he eased back . “
78889	78890	78891	78891	I	91	” “
78895	78979	78891	78891	I	91	” She smiled up at him , her cheeks flushed . He wanted to hear , I missed you , too . The words sort of hung in the air between them . But he knew exactly why they went unsaid . Because the whole phrase would be : I missed you for two years , dummy . He was the one who had put them in this awkward position . So he would have to be the one to get them out . “
78986	78990	78891	78891	I	91	” he asked . “
78995	79001	79004	79004	Mike	2343	” Lauren peered around him . “
79011	79012	79006	79006	Your	2343	” “
79045	79098	79030	79030	I	91	” He squinted at the long white room with its buttery wood floors and hipster light fixtures , wondering what Lauren saw . It was humbling to show her his multimillion dollar pad for the first time when he was guilty of scuttling their life in the city together two years ago . “
79104	79114	79030	79030	I	91	” he suggested . I sure could use one . “
79119	79126	79030	79030	I	91	” she gave a nervous laugh . “
79153	79170	79149	79149	you	2343	” Right . He grinned , and then stepped in to kiss her on the forehead . “
79178	79227	79173	79173	I	91	” He pulled her in for a hug , and when his arms closed around her again , everything seemed less fraught . She tucked her chin against his shoulder and they just stayed there for a moment , both trying to get used to the new normal . “
79235	79244	79173	79173	I	91	” he asked , giving her a squeeze . “
79254	79255	79173	79173	I	91	” “
79260	79264	79173	79173	I	91	” she teased . “
79274	79290	79173	79173	I	91	” He took her hand and led her through the living room toward the stairway . “
79309	79310	79311	79312	Holy cow	259	” “
79317	79329	79311	79312	Holy cow	259	” She craned her neck for a glimpse toward the back . “
79334	79335	79336	79336	I	91	” “
79339	79343	79336	79336	I	91	” he chuckled . “
79362	79383	79355	79355	Elsa	2199	” He led her up to the second floor , where the door to Elsa ’s room was shut tightly . “
79415	79437	79397	79397	Hans	120	” He trudged up the second flight . At the top of the stairs a skylight lit up the narrow hallway . “
79447	79452	79397	79397	Hans	120	” He stepped inside . “
79467	79468	79397	79397	Hans	120	” “
79473	79486	79397	79397	Hans	120	” He stepped into the bright room , with its high ceilings . “
79494	79498	79397	79397	Hans	120	” he said . “
79519	79579	79397	79397	Hans	120	” He pushed open a door in one wall and stepped through into a little room . It had a round , antique window and a painted wood floor . The walls were a rather girly shade of pink . There was n’t a stick of furniture . The room was completely empty . Lauren stepped in behind him . “
79582	79587	79397	79397	Hans	120	” she said quietly . “
79596	79597	79397	79397	Hans	120	” “
79601	79618	79397	79397	Hans	120	” he finished . Her eyes lifted to his , and they were full of questions . “
79621	79634	79635	79635	I	91	” He stepped closer to her and took one of her hands . “
79660	79701	79650	79650	I	91	” Gently , he took a step forward , and then another , until he ’d backed her up against one of the pink walls . Then he cupped the back of her head and brushed his lips across hers . “
79721	79789	79790	79790	Daddy	533	” When her blue eyes softened , he slanted his mouth across hers again . The sound of her sigh went straight to his cock . He pressed more firmly against her body , and wondered what a baby bump on Lauren would look like , and got a thrill just reminding himself she might be carrying his child . If not today , then sometime soon . “
79792	79833	79790	79790	Daddy	533	” Elsa ’s voice carried up the stairs . He gave a frustrated moan against Lauren ’s mouth . He kissed her once more and then stepped back . Leaning his head out of the nursery door , he hollered , “
79839	79840	79790	79790	Daddy	533	” “
79847	79854	79855	79855	I	91	” He cursed under his breath . “
79875	79876	79862	79862	She	1425	” “
79883	79915	79862	79862	She	1425	” Lauren said lightly . Grumbling , he jogged down the stairs . He caught Lauren ’s hand on the second floor landing and stepped through Elsa ’s now open doorway . “
79921	79943	79862	79862	She	1425	” She spun around in her desk chair . And when she saw Lauren standing there too , her eyes narrowed . “
79949	79950	79862	79862	She	1425	” “
79955	79959	79862	79862	She	1425	” Mike chuckled . “
79970	79977	80009	80009	she	1425	” Lauren improved on his definition . “
79999	80005	80009	80009	she	1425	” Mike pointed at Lauren . “
80012	80020	80009	80009	she	1425	” But Elsa did n’t even smile . “
80025	80034	80009	80009	she	1425	” Slowly , his daughter shook her head . “
80043	80048	80009	80009	she	1425	” Another head shake . “
80065	80082	80060	80060	My	91	” She gave him a thumbs - up , which somehow managed to drip with sarcasm . “
80087	80100	80060	80060	My	91	” he said to Lauren in a voice filled with false cheer . “
80109	80154	80105	80105	You	1427	” • • • They ordered homemade gnocchi and prosciutto at a little bistro on Henry Street , and when the conversation began flowing , it was almost like old times . Almost . He asked Lauren what it was like working for Nate . “
80175	80176	80167	80167	I	91	” “
80179	80185	80187	80187	he	402	” he asked , chuckling . “
80191	80192	80187	80187	he	402	” “
80195	80202	80203	80203	He	402	” She shook her pretty head . “
80306	80307	80297	80297	he	91	” “
80313	80314	80297	80297	he	91	” “
80391	80392	80393	80393	Mm	262	” “
80395	80429	80393	80393	Mm	262	” Her knee brushed his under the table , so he relocated his feet in order to increase their contact . Not in a sleazy way — he just wanted to touch her . “
80434	80447	80393	80393	Mm	262	” He did n’t quite know how to word his next question . “
80478	80479	80475	80476	a baby	1970	” “
80483	80488	80489	80489	I	91	” she said quickly . “
80539	80540	80541	80542	Your team	1215	” “
80544	80545	80541	80542	Your team	1215	” “
80557	80558	80560	80560	you	1444	” “
80566	80567	80562	80564	the boss lady	1444	” “
80571	80579	80562	80564	the boss lady	1444	” She gave him a sudden smile . “
80589	80593	80562	80564	the boss lady	1444	” He laughed . “
80609	80622	80596	80596	I	91	” Lauren was a dynamo , though . He should have known . “
80640	80641	80629	80629	I	91	” “
80656	80657	80652	80652	I	91	” “
80669	80676	80677	80677	Nate	91	” She set down her fork . “
80705	80706	80691	80691	We	1450	” “
80714	80745	80746	80746	We	1450	” He drained the last drops of his wine , which he ’d ordered from the restaurant ’s by - the - glass menu , because Lauren was n’t drinking . “
80750	80775	80746	80746	We	1450	” She looked a little shifty - eyed , like she did n’t want to talk about it . So he changed the subject . “
80808	80809	80805	80805	their	1450	” “
80823	80833	80814	80814	I	91	” she said , and her expression was sheepish . “
80855	80859	80860	80860	I	91	” She shrugged . “
80871	80877	80860	80860	I	91	” She cleared her throat . “
80882	80883	80860	80860	I	91	” “
80887	80910	80860	80860	I	91	” Somehow this was more shocking to Mike than any of Lauren ’s other revelations this month . She shook her head . “
80932	80996	80860	80860	I	91	” A silence settled over them . For a moment they just took each other in . He hoped she was happy to be here with him tonight . There was still a lot of sadness he needed to push past . He could do it , though . He was n’t going to give up . Lauren broke their staring contest first . “
81004	81010	80999	80999	I	91	” She folded her napkin . “
81013	81025	81026	81026	I	91	” Her brow furrowed , and she gave a serious nod . “
81065	81066	81037	81037	I	91	” “
81069	81080	81081	81081	You	91	” Seriously ? She tossed the napkin on the table . “
81087	81096	81099	81099	Lo	1597	” A bark of laughter escaped his chest . “
81101	81126	81099	81099	Lo	1597	” She smiled at him and shook her head . And he kept laughing . He was dabbing his eyes before he finally stopped . “
81134	81135	81136	81136	I	91	” “
81139	81337	81338	81338	I	91	” She stretched her fork across to stab a scrap of prosciutto off his plate . He watched her mouth as she chewed , and wished he could just tuck her under his arm , carry her back to his lonely bed and hold her all night long . It was n’t going to happen , though . Not tonight . He was n’t quite ready to have that talk with Elsa yet . The Lauren - will - be - around - a - lot - more - often talk . Better to ease her into it . He signaled for the check . In an effort to prolong Lauren ’s visit , if only for a few minutes , they walked over to the Promenade and looked out at the river . The Staten Island ferry chugged toward lower Manhattan in the distance , and tulips were blooming in thick beds beside the walkway . He took Lauren ’s hand , and they walked among all the other couples , as if the events of this evening were the most ordinary thing in the world . They were n’t , but maybe they could be . “
81344	81361	81338	81338	I	91	” Lauren said eventually . She tightened her trench coat against the breeze off the river . “
81369	81378	81362	81362	I	91	” She shook her head with a smile . “
81394	81400	81362	81362	I	91	” Grudgingly , he did . “
81406	81420	81362	81362	I	91	” she said when they were only a block from the subway entrance . “
81424	81432	81433	81433	I	91	” he said , squeezing her hand . “
81453	81454	81433	81433	I	91	” “
81460	81486	81487	81487	I	91	” she said , which was n’t exactly a promise . He tugged her in for a kiss that lingered as long as he dared . “
81497	81522	81487	81487	I	91	” She opened her mouth as if to say something , but then changed her mind . She cocked her head , studying him . “
81525	81531	81487	81487	I	91	” Lauren shook her head . “
81538	81539	81540	81540	I	91	” “
81548	81602	81540	81540	I	91	” She stood on tiptoe and pecked him on the cheekbone . Then he had to let her disappear into the station alone . Five minutes later he walked into his house to find Hans on the sofa , and clean shirts in their dry cleaner ’s plastic hanging from the stairway bannister . “
81609	81616	81540	81540	I	91	” He pointed at the hangers . “
81629	81630	81631	81631	You	91	” “
81658	81659	81660	81660	You	91	” “
81665	81696	81660	81660	You	91	” Mike stopped to listen to the violin music rolling down the staircase . It was some fast - paced tune he could n’t identify . And it sounded angry . “
81705	81706	81707	81707	Ja	125	” “
81709	81713	81714	81714	She	125	” Hans said . “
81723	81724	81714	81714	She	125	” “
81733	81737	81727	81727	her	125	” Hans nodded . “
81748	81751	81753	81753	she	125	” Crap . “
81757	81758	81759	81759	Ja	125	” “
81763	81764	81765	81765	I	91	” “
81771	81813	81765	81765	I	91	” He climbed the stairs , and the music got louder and louder . He waited in her doorway while Elsa built the tune to a frenzy and then finished it with one loud , lingering bellow across her D string . “
81816	81850	81765	81765	I	91	” he said when the last reverberations died away . She did n’t reply . She just wiped rosin off her instrument with a cloth , then loosened the pin in her bow . “
81856	81860	81765	81765	I	91	” he tried . “
81868	81875	81765	81765	I	91	” She slammed the case shut . “
81881	81890	81765	81765	I	91	” Elsa looked up , her face red . “
81912	81916	81904	81904	your	91	” Oh boy . “
81939	81953	81956	81956	friends	473	” But , fuck . The day ’s itinerary was n’t the point . “
81963	81964	81965	81965	Friends	473	” “
81967	81975	81965	81965	Friends	473	” she spat , her eyes flashing . “
82002	82003	82004	82004	Elsa	2199	” “
82006	82015	82004	82004	Elsa	2199	” he barked , his blood pressure skyrocketing . “
82018	82029	82004	82004	Elsa	2199	” she snapped , the challenge on her face clear . “
82048	82052	82039	82039	I’m	91	” he roared . “
82073	82118	82066	82066	she	461	” Later he ’d wonder why he had to go and do that . But at the mention of her mother , Elsa ’s bravado crumbled . She turned her face away as if she ’d been slapped . Then her eyes welled up . “
82125	82214	82066	82066	she	461	” she screamed . Now there was a great idea . He turned and bounded down the stairs to the living room . Before he got there , her bedroom door slammed with such force that he heard one of her pictures fall off the wall , too . And when his feet brought him into the living room again , poor Hans was still sitting there , looking uncomfortable . He ’d lost his cool and actually shamed his daughter . And in front of an audience . “
82217	82347	82066	82066	she	461	” Beacon took a deep breath . Instead of bolting upstairs to his own room to regroup , he threw himself down on the other end of the couch from Hans , putting his feet on the coffee table . Then he tipped his head back and sighed . She ’s a grieving child , he reminded himself . It ’s too much for her to process . If things worked out between him and Lauren , there ’d be a hell of a lot more to process , though . What would Elsa say if he and Lauren were having a baby ? Nothing civil , that was for sure . Hans got up and disappeared for a minute , reappearing with a beer for each of them . “
82354	82366	82350	82350	I	91	” Mike muttered as his hand closed around the cold bottle . “
82378	82383	82350	82350	I	91	” Hans said quietly . “
82397	82412	82387	82387	She	1462	” Slutty . He could n’t even say it out loud . Poor Lauren . “
82443	82444	82445	82445	Shelly	2023	” “
82453	82458	82445	82445	Shelly	2023	” Hans pointed out . “
82505	82509	82510	82510	I	91	” Mike groaned . “
82516	82517	82510	82510	I	91	” “
82522	82523	82524	82524	I	91	” “
82529	82535	82524	82524	I	91	” Mike rubbed his temples . “
82545	82546	82524	82524	I	91	” “
82553	82554	82524	82524	I	91	” “
82570	82574	82575	82575	She	461	” Maybe soon . “
82582	82596	82575	82575	She	461	” Shit . He was still breaking hearts . It was never ending . “
82603	82608	82597	82597	I	91	” Hans said slowly . “
82613	82619	82597	82597	I	91	” The other man chuckled . “
82649	82650	82635	82635	she	461	” “
82659	82669	82635	82635	she	461	” Mike admitted to himself as well as Hans . “
82674	82675	82676	82676	I	91	” “
82687	82697	82676	82676	I	91	” Mike grinned into the bottle in his hand . “
82712	82810	82705	82705	We	1470	” TWENTY - FOUR The following night , in a burst of optimism , Lauren went to watch Mike try to shut out Detroit in game four . She did n’t need a ticket . Her team credentials got her all the way into Nate ’s box — voluntarily this time . Neither Ari nor Georgia so much as raised an eyebrow . Even though it was empty , Lauren did n’t take the seat beside Nate , though . She was too nervous . Pacing back and forth near the cheese puffs was more her speed . “
82815	82819	82820	82820	You	1471	” Georgia asked . “
82828	82841	82820	82820	You	1471	” She almost said yes , before remembering why she could n’t . “
82849	82850	82820	82820	You	1471	” “
82871	82893	82864	82864	I	91	” When the game was still scoreless at the end of the second period , Lauren let out a loud groan . “
82906	82907	82894	82894	I	91	” “
82910	82914	82894	82894	I	91	” Ari agreed . “
82929	82982	82995	82995	she	1474	” Nate , as usual , sat stoically in his seat , eyes affixed to the ice . Lauren noticed that Rebecca was not present tonight , and she wondered why that was . When Nate got up to refill his glass of Diet Coke , he gave her a Nate smirk . “
83001	83002	82995	82995	she	1474	” “
83008	83012	83013	83013	I	91	” she grumbled . “
83021	83027	83013	83013	I	91	” He lifted an eyebrow . “
83031	83032	83033	83033	I	91	” “
83044	83724	83033	83033	I	91	” Georgia giggled . And that was the last moment of levity that evening . The game ground on , scoreless through the third period . After the Zamboni cleared the ice one more time , Lauren watched her boys come back on for the overtime period . They looked tired , but determined . So did Detroit . Lauren fidgeted as play began again . She chewed ice cubes and rocked on her heels . Her eyes were dry from staring so long at the rink . Overtime periods were n’t like regular periods , though — they were played with the sudden death rule . A goal ended the game . So one moment Lauren was watching Trevi try to get the puck away from his opponent , who passed it behind his body . One second later another opponent was flying toward Mike with the puck , unguarded on a breakaway . She saw Mike look for the deke and make his choice , positioning his body toward the left . Then the puck flew right past his right shoulder and into the net . Before she could had even make sense of the play , the game was over . Mike collapsed in frustration onto the ice , his head in his hands . And fifteen thousand Brooklyn fans made noises of frustration . That was it . Time to hit the showers , boys . Nothing more to be done tonight . Depressed , Lauren made her way downstairs , as if by habit . At a home game , with Becca covering the office again , there was no reason for her to stick around . Except for one . The corridor outside the dressing room was buzzing with journalists and family members . It was terribly crowded . Even as Lauren contemplated fighting her way through the scrum , she spotted Elsa and her babysitter down there , waiting for Mike to make an appearance . Lauren hesitated . She hung back , trying to decide what to do . Whatever words of support she might offer Mike tonight would keep until tomorrow . As she thought it through , the dressing room door opened and the man himself came through it , his hair wet from the shower . His daughter lunged . She threw herself at him , grabbing him around the neck and hugging him tightly . Mike closed his eyes . He lifted his girl into the air and said something tender into her ear . Lauren turned around then without another thought . The man had his hands full . She made her way out to street level , where she found a yellow cab with its light on and got inside . I ’m sorry , she texted Mike from the cab . Ca n’t win ’em all . Talk tomorrow ? When her phone vibrated a moment later , she looked for Mike ’s reply . But the text was n’t from him . It was from her father . I knew they ’d choke , he said . Nice , dad , she wanted to reply . The man was still bitter . Yet glued to the game . She could picture him in his lounge chair , yelling at the TV . Lauren put her phone away and spent the rest of the ride looking out the window , watching the lights of New York City speed toward her on the Brooklyn Bridge . It was such a romantic view of a busy city that it was easy for her to imagine that she was the only one alone tonight . Do n’t go there , she coached herself . She was no more alone tonight than she ’d been during her other single years . When her cab arrived at her apartment building , she paid the man and got out . Inside her lobby , she gave Jerry , the night doorman , a wave on her way to the elevator . “
83730	83742	83033	83033	I	91	” he asked as she waited for the car to descend . “
83754	83755	83033	83033	I	91	” “
83769	83777	83760	83760	I	91	” He leaned forward in his seat . “
83793	83817	83790	83791	Miss Lauren	114	” She laughed , because that was hysterical . Her whole life had been hockey until the minute she moved into this building . “
83849	83855	83844	83844	I	91	” His eyes popped wide . “
83867	83868	83861	83861	You	1476	” “
83872	83882	83861	83861	You	1476	” The elevator doors parted in front of her . “
83889	83897	83898	83898	You	114	” Jerry yelled as she stepped inside . “
83904	83999	84000	84000	Jerry	268	” she returned . Upstairs , her apartment was dark and quiet . She changed into a nightgown and took a prenatal vitamin . Then she got in bed , wondering if the game had left her too keyed up to sleep . She was just drifting off an hour or so later when the doorman ’s buzzer blared through her small apartment . She almost ignored it . Nobody ever knocked on her door at midnight . But it buzzed again . She got up and padded to the handset on the wall . “
84002	84010	84000	84000	Jerry	268	” He never rang her this late . “
84031	84041	84042	84042	He	2343	” He said it as if announcing the pope . “
84045	84057	84042	84042	He	2343	” She failed to keep the surprise out of her voice . “
84066	84070	84061	84061	I	91	” Jerry whispered . “
84109	84110	84112	84112	him	268	” “
84116	84117	84121	84121	sir	114	” “
84123	84129	84121	84121	sir	114	” she heard Jerry say . “
84132	84152	84153	84153	We	1484	” But the doorman did n’t hang up yet . After a beat he whispered into the handset again . “
84163	84164	84165	84165	We	1484	” “
84168	84169	84165	84165	We	1484	” “
84189	84190	84191	84191	Angelique	2052	” “
84197	84209	84210	84210	She	2023	” Hockey fans were just coming out of the woodwork tonight . “
84241	84242	84245	84245	man	533	” “
84259	84260	84261	84261	You	533	” “
84275	84276	84272	84273	Miss Lauren	114	” “
84288	84297	84280	84280	you	114	” There was a tap on her door . “
84309	84310	84304	84305	My visitor	1488	” “
84318	84353	84304	84305	My visitor	1488	” He hung up laughing . Lauren opened the door to Mike wearing his game night suit — the tie loosened haphazardly — and a haggard expression . Her smile slid off her face . “
84359	84363	84356	84356	You	114	” He shrugged . “
84372	84373	84356	84356	You	114	” “
84379	84388	84376	84377	Gold star	1489	” She stepped aside , motioning him inside . “
84405	84406	84393	84393	our	1490	” “
84424	84441	84417	84417	you	114	” He dropped his gym bag on the floor and pulled her against his suit jacket . “
84456	84457	84417	84417	you	114	” “
84460	84475	84417	84417	you	114	” She inhaled his scent — a mixture of shower soap and wool gabardine . “
84490	84501	84417	84417	you	114	” He pushed her hair aside and kissed her neck . “
84519	84550	84551	84551	I	91	” He kicked her door shut and then pushed her up against it . His mouth found her jawline , where he began to drop soft open - mouthed kisses . “
84562	84575	84551	84551	I	91	” He tongued the sensitive hollow between her neck and her shoulder . “
84594	84699	84585	84585	You	114	” She made an ineloquent noise of pleasure , but they both knew he was right . Lauren placed her hands on his chest , pushing the lapels of his jacket apart . His skin radiated warmth beneath his shirt . It was late , and it had been a long night . But when his hands skimmed down her bare arms , landing on her scantily covered hips , her libido woke up and offered to take his coat , and every other stitch of fabric on his body . For starters , she loosened his tie and tossed it on the floor . “
84709	84710	84711	84711	They	1339	” “
84717	84724	84711	84711	They	1339	” he murmured against her skin . “
84731	84763	84711	84711	They	1339	” He cupped her jaw in one hand and raised her chin . She waited , expecting to be kissed . He only studied her instead , his dark eyes intense . “
84766	84770	84771	84771	I	91	” she breathed . “
84791	84818	84783	84783	I	91	” When she threw her arms around him a second later , she knew she was in trouble . She was tired of playing it cool . “
84832	84839	84783	84783	I	91	” He chuckled into her hair . “
84847	84848	84783	84783	I	91	” “
84855	84863	84853	84853	Mike	2343	” In for a penny . . . “
84874	84888	84869	84869	Lo	1597	” She believed him . But that did n’t make things any easier . “
84893	84898	84869	84869	Lo	1597	” She stepped back . “
84910	84911	84912	84912	You	270	” “
84917	84926	84912	84912	You	270	” He took her hand and kissed it . “
84931	84951	84912	84912	You	270	” Threading her fingers into his , she led him through the darkened living room and into her bedroom . “
84958	84969	84912	84912	You	270	” she said , flipping on the light in there . “
84974	85116	84912	84912	You	270	” She gave him a little nudge and then left him , climbing into her four - poster bed . She ’d bought her bedroom furniture with her first paycheck from Nate . It was white — a little girly , maybe . But she ’d been trying to cheer herself up . Many of those early nights she ’d lain here , just wishing Mike Beacon was here in the apartment with her . How weird that he actually was . He emerged from her bathroom a couple of minutes later , shutting off the light behind him . In the glow of the ambient light shining through her windows — Manhattan was never dark — she watched him strip out of his suit , dropping the pants and shirt over the upholstered bench at the end of the bed . “
85120	85130	84912	84912	You	270	” he said huskily . Off came his boxers . “
85142	85149	85135	85135	You	1078	” she teased . He shrugged . “
85162	85188	85192	85192	sweetheart	1078	” He walked around to the side of the bed and tugged the quilt aside . He slid into bed and rolled to face her . “
85199	85320	85321	85321	I	91	” She went willingly . Greedily , even . She laid her head on his chest , lifting a hand to sift her fingers through the silky hair dusting his pecs and thickening over his abdomen into the happiest of happy trails . His chest hair was her secret fetish . She regarded it as evidence of his abundant supply of testosterone . Lying there in silence , she was gripped by a powerful déja vu . So many nights they ’d gotten into bed together after a game , both of them tired , yet kept awake by the thoughts spinning through their respective brains . The comfort of skin on skin was what eventually put them to sleep . “
85331	85336	85321	85321	I	91	” he said eventually . “
85348	85356	85321	85321	I	91	” He did n’t answer right away . “
85370	85371	85376	85376	she	2199	” “
85391	85395	85376	85376	she	2199	” He sighed . “
85444	85445	85476	85476	she	461	” “
85454	85466	85476	85476	she	461	” she asked , picturing their hug in the corridor tonight . “
85521	85522	85499	85499	I	91	” “
85530	85531	85533	85534	a shrink	1501	” “
85573	85574	85576	85576	you	91	” “
85579	85587	85588	85588	I	91	” Lauren suggested softly . He groaned . “
85625	85626	85618	85618	She	2023	” “
85639	85640	85618	85618	She	2023	” “
85646	85655	85656	85656	You	91	” He gave her ass a friendly squeeze . “
85675	85676	85673	85673	missy	2023	” “
85690	85733	85677	85677	You	91	” They fell silent for another moment . His hand trailed down her ribcage , then onto her tummy . He pressed his palm against her lower abdomen , then rubbed gently . She closed her eyes and sank into the sensation . “
85740	85741	85677	85677	You	91	” “
85744	85745	85746	85746	Our	1502	” “
85761	85762	85763	85763	You	91	” “
85787	85788	85775	85776	The ref	2466	” “
85797	85798	85790	85790	I	91	” “
85804	85811	85790	85790	I	91	” He laughed into her hair . “
85819	85820	85790	85790	I	91	” “
85826	85827	85828	85828	Mike	2343	” “
85830	85831	85828	85828	Mike	2343	” “
85849	85945	85946	85946	I	91	” He grabbed her hips and pulled her body onto his , and then kissed her . She relaxed onto his big frame , like a cat taking up residence on its favorite lap . He obviously did n’t understand her reluctance to speculate about a pregnancy . He was so sure it would succeed , and she was somehow positive it would n’t . And if it did n’t . . . then what ? Would he still be here in her bed thinking optimistic thoughts ? His long fingers threaded through her hair . “
85959	86233	85955	85955	I	91	” What was the saying ? It takes fewer muscles to smile than to stay up all night worrying about the future . So she kissed the man again as he closed his eyes . TWENTY - FIVE Beacon woke to the sound of an unfamiliar alarm tone . Beside him , Lauren cursed and fumbled for her Katt Phone , silencing it . Then she snuggled closer to him , her back to his chest . He tugged her little body closer to his , then wrapped an arm around her waist , letting his fingers drift on a slow tour of her body . She was wearing a gloriously skimpy nighty . He smoothed the silk down her belly , then lifted the hem to palm her bare belly . When he ’d showed up at Lauren ’s door last night , it had n’t been for sex . He ’d needed to lie in the dark with someone who loved him . When they were together , she had always been a steadying force in his life . Hell — she was a steadying force before they ever held each other in bed , or even kissed for the first time . His wife . . . was n’t . Shelly had been attracted to him once . But the whole hockey wife thing had worn thin for her when Elsa was still a toddler . She was angry at her lot in life , and she felt free to take it out on him . When they argued over anything , she would remind him that he was just a “
86237	86348	86597	86597	baby	793	” He felt like one , too , every time she said it . Last night he ’d taken a cab to Lauren ’s place after losing a big game . Then he ’d proceeded to admit that he did n’t have a clue what to say to his own kid . Yet Lauren did n’t pander or praise him . Neither did she judge him . She just held him instead . Slowly , he dragged his fingertips between her hip bones , discovering that she was not wearing panties . This revelation caused him to let out a shameless little moan , and he was n’t even embarrassed . “
86354	86359	86565	86565	Wo	270	” she asked sleepily . “
86364	86538	86565	86565	Wo	270	” He skimmed his fingertips down over her mound , through the tiny V of silky hairs she had there . She shivered , yet did n’t open her legs for him . So he teased this little patch of loveliness , and her thighs , too . It was a privilege to wake up beside her . A year from now he knew they ’d wake up every morning in a bed together . He was sure of it , even if the details were n’t worked out yet , and even though he was n’t allowed to speculate . Lauren had said last night that everything was complicated . But that was only on the surface . It was pretty damn simple how much he loved her , and how much they needed each other . Their complications would be dealt with one at a time . Somehow . Beacon pushed the hair off Lauren ’s neck and began kissing her there . She shivered , her body arching against his . “
86546	86550	86551	86551	I	91	” she whispered . “
86572	86589	86565	86565	Wo	270	” He slipped his hand between her thighs and was greeted by slickness and soft warmth . “
86599	86661	86597	86597	baby	793	” Instead of rolling toward him , she tipped the other way , onto her stomach . She spread her legs and arms , relaxing into the pillow , just waiting for him . Unngh . He ran a hand down her body slowly , from the nape of her creamy neck , down her back , over her sweet ass . “
86667	86703	86664	86665	my girl	793	” he said , his voice raspy with desire . He maneuvered until he could kneel between her spread legs and touch her again . She jumped when his fingertips made contact with her pussy . “
86708	86777	86779	86779	you	793	” he ordered , and that beautiful body lifted in invitation half a second later . Yes , yes , he chanted as he slid inside her perfect , tight heat . Beneath him , Lauren pushed her face into the pillow and whimpered . He planted his elbows on either side of her body so he could whisper in her ear while he pumped his hips slowly . “
86781	86785	86779	86779	you	793	” he panted . “
86804	86815	86800	86800	you	793	” With a deep moan she pushed back against him . “
86820	86831	86800	86800	you	793	” he said , snaking one hand underneath her body . “
86839	86858	86800	86800	you	793	” He stroked her clumsily , his heart rate ratcheting up as she let out a throaty sigh . “
86861	86957	86800	86800	you	793	” she demanded , and he almost came on the spot . Gritting his teeth , he gave it to her the best he could . He remembered all too well the last time they did this , and it was sexy as hell . She might already be carrying his child . The idea made his heart so full he could n’t take it any longer . He came with a shout , curling over her body and shuddering through it . She followed him over the edge , gasping and pulsing beneath him . “
86960	86964	86800	86800	you	793	” she breathed . “
86970	86979	86800	86800	you	793	” He grinned . Who could blame him ? “
86982	86996	86997	86997	I	91	” she said , reaching a clumsy hand around to smack his thigh . “
87002	87003	86997	86997	I	91	” “
87010	87011	87005	87005	I	91	” “
87021	87022	87023	87023	Baby	163	” “
87030	87031	87032	87032	You	91	” “
87036	87037	87038	87038	I	91	” “
87043	87076	87077	87077	I	91	” They showered , and he behaved himself . Mostly . When she shut off the taps he pressed her against the tiles and kissed her one more time . For luck . “
87085	87086	87087	87087	Me	91	” “
87093	87097	87091	87091	you	91	” she whispered . “
87120	87129	87110	87110	You	91	” His inner caveman needed one more kiss . “
87139	87146	87110	87110	You	91	” he murmured against her lips . “
87151	87269	87110	87110	You	91	” • • • They left Lauren ’s building together , parting on the street , each of them heading for different subway trains . He needed the number two train to Clark Street in Brooklyn , and rush hour traffic would make a cab ride miserable . In this fashion he discovered how miserable the commute was from the East 30s to Brooklyn . The timeline for moving Lauren into his house on Willow Street moved up another month for every midtown block he walked . When he finally reached home , he put the key in the lock and opened the door , whistling . Only to find Elsa staring at him from the sofa . “
87277	87311	87110	87110	You	91	” was the first stupid thing that popped into his head . Her eyebrows lifted , and her look of disapproval was so much like Shelly ’s that it was n’t even funny . “
87319	87324	87110	87110	You	91	” she said slowly . “
87327	87368	87110	87110	You	91	” Hans had probably put it on his calendar , but he ’d forgotten to check . He dropped his gym bag on the floor where it landed with a thunk that sounded deafening in all the silence between them . “
87378	87391	87369	87369	I	91	” she said . That ’s what I wanted you to think . “
87396	87397	87394	87394	Hans	120	” “
87413	87456	87457	87457	I	91	” Mike took off his jacket and hung it on the doorknob of the little coat closet . Then , having no further busy work for his hands , he took a seat on the opposite end of the couch from Elsa . “
87463	87497	87457	87457	I	91	” he admitted . He knew this conversation was a can of worms , but lying was n’t a good option . Elsa was n’t stupid , and it set a horrible example . “
87501	87506	87457	87457	I	91	” Her eyes narrowed . “
87509	87526	87457	87457	I	91	” Kill me already . Maybe lying would have been the way to go after all . “
87535	87567	87568	87568	I	91	” Oof . He had to think carefully about his answer . But it was tricky to be honest without allowing the conversation to veer into topics too personal for discussion . “
87593	87601	87580	87580	I	91	” And was n’t that the truth . “
87609	87620	87621	87621	I	91	” Elsa ’s voice was as sharp as her questions . “
87627	87636	87621	87621	I	91	” But I like the sound of that . “
87641	87646	87637	87637	You	1508	” Elsa said quickly . “
87652	87653	87654	87654	Honey	274	” “
87656	87661	87662	87662	I	91	” he said softly . “
87670	87684	87662	87662	I	91	” He checked her face , which was half grumpy and half scared . “
87689	87693	87662	87662	I	91	” she croaked . “
87709	87720	87662	87662	I	91	” Fuck . Elsa : 1 , Daddy : 0 . “
87751	87806	87739	87739	I	91	” Elsa made an anguished noise that doubled his blood pressure . He ’d thought he could ease her into the idea . Then he got caught doing the walk of shame . But it did n’t even matter , because any mention of Lauren at all turned his daughter into a rabid cat . “
87809	87825	87826	87827	Your mother	481	” he said , and then realized he had no idea what to say next . “
87833	87868	87869	87869	Lauren	114	” did n’t love each other . That was n’t the right thing to say , because Elsa did n’t care . She just wanted her family back the way she remembered it best . “
87880	87885	87869	87869	Lauren	114	” he said instead . “
87920	88178	87903	87903	I	91	” His daughter ’s eyes reddened , and he braced himself for an outburst . But it did n’t come . She lifted her chin and stood , her posture regal . Then she carried herself up the stairs to her room , where he heard the door click shut . He let out a heavy breath . That could have gone worse , he reminded himself . But it had n’t gone well . Baby steps , right ? He was a patient man . All top - notch goalies were . He would wait Elsa out , and tell her he loved her at every opportunity . She ’d believe him , eventually , because it was the truth . • • • The next four days were shitty , and it had nothing to do with the women in his life . He had a terrible game five in Detroit , letting in goals he should have saved . They could have clinched the series that night if he had n’t been off his game . Off nights happened , it was a known fact . But his timing was spectacularly bad . Going into game six the series was 3–2 , which would n’t have been so bad if it were n’t for those two back - to - back losses . The team had squandered all the momentum they ’d built up early in the series . Back in Brooklyn , the dressing room was quiet before the game . Too quiet . “
88187	88208	87903	87903	I	91	” Doulie said , walking around the oval to give every one of his guys a slap on the back . “
88216	88299	87903	87903	I	91	” They could n’t , though . It was only a small consolation that the game six loss was n’t Beacon ’s fault . The defensemen screwed up early in the first period , giving Detroit an easy goal with an odd man rush . Then the forwards seemed to freeze up , and it was downhill for the rest of the game . They lost 5–2 . The series was now 3–3 , and the pundits were having a field day . “
88302	88319	87903	87903	I	91	” blared more than one headline . The talking heads began to drop statistics like raindrops . “
88337	88340	87903	87903	I	91	” And , “
88358	88434	87903	87903	I	91	” Beacon listened to all of this chatter with half an ear . No matter what anyone said , when a series went to game seven , the odds were still fifty - fifty . He did n’t need Elsa ’s new math tutor to know that . Still , it did n’t feel good . At the briefing the morning after their loss , Coach Worthington practically had smoke coming out of his ears . “
88443	88504	87903	87903	I	91	” he said a million times . He talked plays and habits and formations until every player went glassy - eyed . After a light workout in the weight room , he walked home to pack for yet another trip to Detroit . On the way he tried Lauren on his Katt Phone . She answered on the second ring . “
88508	88509	88511	88511	yourself	1517	” “
88520	88550	88511	88511	yourself	1517	” He had n’t sought solace in her bed after their most recent loss , but it sure had been tempting . They texted into the wee hours instead . “
88555	88556	88511	88511	yourself	1517	” “
88566	88567	88511	88511	yourself	1517	” “
88589	88590	88578	88578	I	91	” “
88598	88599	88594	88594	I	91	” “
88602	88623	88624	88624	I	91	” she said , reminding him that the play - offs — no matter how exhausting — didn’t last forever . “
88629	88630	88624	88624	I	91	” “
88633	88634	88624	88624	I	91	” “
88651	88655	88646	88647	A guy	2349	” She laughed . “
88679	88680	88674	88674	Becca	357	” “
88705	88706	88700	88700	I	91	” “
88732	88733	88728	88728	I	91	” “
88759	88760	88761	88761	I	91	” “
88775	88776	88768	88768	I	91	” “
88795	88796	88788	88788	we	1522	” “
88816	88817	88818	88818	I	91	” “
88822	88844	88845	88845	I	91	” he said . He was just going to keep saying that forever , and he wanted her to know it . “
88865	88931	88859	88859	I	91	” His feet had reached Willow Street , so he let himself in . He heard pop music from the second floor and NPR in the kitchen . Mike headed for the kitchen and a glass of water , startling Hans , who looked up from the kitchen table with a sheepish expression . He clutched his phone in one hand , the screen lit . “
88939	88960	88859	88859	I	91	” Seemed like nobody in his life was happy this week . Hans shoved his phone into his shirt pocket . “
88963	88964	88859	88859	I	91	” “
88975	88983	88971	88971	Justin	122	” Hans laughed and shook his head . “
88990	88991	88992	88992	I	91	” “
89000	89006	88994	88998	the king of poor timing	91	” he reminded the babysitter . “
89012	89013	88994	88998	the king of poor timing	91	” “
89030	89046	89019	89019	I	91	” Oh , hell . That probably meant that it did matter a great deal . “
89051	89052	89049	89049	me	91	” “
89082	89083	89084	89084	Hamilton	181	” “
89086	89094	89084	89084	Hamilton	181	” Elsa came skidding around the corner . “
89108	89109	89102	89102	You	91	” “
89114	89118	89102	89102	You	91	” Mike asked . “
89133	89142	89123	89123	they	1524	” Tomorrow night . Game seven in Detroit . “
89147	89189	89123	89123	they	1524	” Hans had turned down gigs before to accommodate Beacon ’s game schedule . But never an important one . He ’d already bought plane tickets for Elsa and Hans to fly out for game seven . They left tomorrow afternoon . “
89200	89212	89198	89198	Hans	120	” Elsa volunteered immediately . Hans was already shaking his head . “
89233	89234	89224	89224	They	1524	” “
89263	89264	89250	89250	I	91	” “
89269	89277	89267	89267	Elsabelle	179	” Hans said , his smile sad . “
89293	89294	89283	89283	I	91	” “
89301	89305	89295	89295	I	91	” Mike said . “
89327	89334	89315	89315	Hans	120	” The babysitter shook his head . “
89347	89563	89341	89341	I	91	” TWENTY - SIX DETROIT , MICHIGAN MAY 2016 Lauren ’s travel companion maintained a stony silence on the ninety - minute flight from La Guardia to Detroit , her earbuds jammed into her ears . From the seat beside her , Lauren stole occasional glances at Elsa , remembering how hard it was to be thirteen . At that age she ’d felt mostly grown up . She ’d been the same highly organized , disciplined go - getter at thirteen as she was today . But nobody had been ready to acknowledge it . Parents and teachers still treated her like a child . And her body was doing all sorts of embarrassing new things . You could n’t pay her to be thirteen again . No sum would be enough . At the baggage claim in Detroit , a driver waited with a sign reading BEACON FAMILY because Mike had made all the arrangements . Elsa gave both the sign and the driver a glare , just in case nobody in the Detroit metro area had missed her displeasure at traveling with Lauren . It ’s not personal , Lauren reminded herself during the forty - minute drive to the hotel . When they got there , it was already five o’clock . “
89571	89597	89341	89341	I	91	” she asked Elsa . Though sitting across the table from someone who did n’t speak to you did n’t sound like that much fun . “
89618	89619	89620	89620	I	91	” “
89626	89630	89631	89631	We	1528	” Elsa said . “
89635	89668	89631	89631	We	1528	” Okay then . When the car ( finally ! ) pulled up at the hotel , Lauren was relieved to discover that keys to their adjoining rooms were ready and waiting . “
89684	89691	89677	89677	we	1528	” Lauren said in the elevator . “
89711	89712	89698	89698	We	1528	” “
89715	89743	89744	89744	I	91	” Sigh . Lauren opened Elsa ’s room door first . It was a nice double . Inside , she opened the lock to the adjacent door . “
89755	90071	90072	90072	Honey	274	” she told the girl . Elsa did n’t say anything . She just climbed onto the bed and pulled out her iPad . Lauren went back into the hallway and keyed into her room , which contained a king - sized bed and Mike ’s luggage . He ’d left a note on the bed . Lo — Thank you so much for everything . Hope she has n’t been too hard on you . ( But I ’m willing to bet she has . ) Ca n’t wait to see you tonight . Love you , M. Aw . A few hours with a grumpy teenager were n’t so bad . She tucked the note into her purse and hung her garment bag in the closet . She unlocked the door which adjoined Elsa ’s room , but when she opened the door , she found that Elsa had already closed hers . TV sounds came through the door . Leaving Elsa in peace , Lauren took out her eReader and climbed onto the bed . A nap sounded good , which was odd . She had n’t napped in years . But this week she ’d felt oddly tired . So tired , in fact , that she did n’t even make it through five pages of her book before falling asleep . When Lauren opened her eyes again , she was disoriented . The room had deepened into shadows , and for a moment she was n’t sure where she was . When she woke completely , her eyes flew to the clock . It was six thirty . She ’d slept more than an hour . Jumping up , Lauren went into the bathroom to splash water on her face and brush her teeth . Feeling almost human , she went to knock on the door adjoining Elsa ’s room . “
90084	90263	90264	90264	Elsa	2199	” Silence . Even the TV noises were gone . Lauren tapped again , but the girl did n’t answer , and she did n’t hear any movement . Grasping the knob , she tried to open it . Locked . A chill snaked up Lauren ’s spine . Her mind offered up an ugly scenario . What if Elsa got even with her by disappearing ? She could only imagine the phone call she ’d have to make to Mike . I ’ve lost your child . Do n’t panic , she coached herself . While a rogue thirteen - year - old on the loose in Detroit was not ideal , there was no reason to think that any harm had come to Elsa . Luckily , Lauren had held onto one of the key cards to Elsa ’s room . If the kid was just playing possum in there , Lauren would know in a moment . She grabbed Elsa ’s key and went out into the hall . She knocked briskly on the door . “
90282	90359	90360	90360	Elsa	2199	” Nothing . Having no other choice , she waved the card in front of the scanner , pushing the door open when the light turned green . Elsa ’s room was beginning to darken , too , though nobody was napping on the bed . Her heart dove toward her shoes , until she saw the strip of light under the bathroom door . Thank you , baby Jesus . Lauren tapped on the door . “
90376	90414	90415	90415	Elsa	2199	” She waited , expecting to hear the teen say she ’d been in the shower . But Elsa did n’t say a word . Though . . . Lauren listened harder . She heard a sniffle . “
90427	90428	90422	90422	you	2199	” “
90435	90447	90422	90422	you	2199	” The tingle at the base of her skull was back . “
90452	90453	90454	90454	I	91	” “
90458	90464	90465	90465	Honey	274	” Lauren heard a sob . “
90478	90479	90480	90480	I	91	” “
90484	90485	90480	90480	I	91	” “
90492	90558	90480	90480	I	91	” Her mind began offering up explanations , each more frightening than the last . Elsa had slipped and hit her head . Elsa had slit her wrist with a razor blade . Elsa was experimenting with heroin . Okay , the kid ’s carry - on would never have passed inspection if those last two were true . But still . She tapped again . “
90563	90576	90577	90577	God	114	” She tried the knob . It was locked , of course . “
90585	90668	90577	90577	God	114	” Lauren took the kind of deep , cleansing breath that Ari tried to get her yoga classes to take . Then she took two more . Yelling at a locked door was not going to win the girl ’s trust . She backed away , then opened the adjoining door to slip back into her own room . She dug out her Katt Phone and tried to think . After a few more yoga breaths , she called Mike ’s number . “
90764	90836	90837	90837	Honey	274	” She hung up , wondering if calling him had been the right thing to do . Mike probably would n’t see that message before the game , anyway . He was probably stretching with his teammates and chatting with the goaltending coach . Lauren went back into Elsa ’s room and stared at the door . She ’s only a sad teenager , not a lion , Lauren reminded herself . “
90839	90846	90837	90837	Honey	274	” she said to the door . “
90879	90880	90837	90837	Honey	274	” “
90883	90903	90837	90837	Honey	274	” Elsa invested so much fear into this short word that Lauren ’s pulse kicked up a notch again . “
90906	90974	90837	90837	Honey	274	” Lauren demanded . The bathroom doorknob had a little hole in the center of it . The ones in her apartment were the same . If she could thread a straightened coat - hanger into that hole , the lock would release with a pop . . . The doorknob turned suddenly and Elsa ’s face appeared in the crack , looking both angry and scared . “
90982	90983	90837	90837	Honey	274	” “
90989	90993	90837	90837	Honey	274	” Lauren whispered . “
91002	91003	90837	90837	Honey	274	” “
91006	91093	90837	90837	Honey	274	” Lauren nudged the door , moving Elsa out of the way . When it swung open she saw bright red blood on the bath mat . She grabbed Elsa ’s wrists in her hands , but they were perfect . And shaking . A fraction of a second later , more pieces of the puzzle began to align themselves together . The pair of jeans cast onto the floor . The wastebasket full of wadded - up tissue . The red smear on the toilet . “
91100	91120	91097	91097	your	91	” Elsa nodded tearfully , and Lauren felt a great flood of relief . Then one more lightbulb illuminated . “
91126	91138	91097	91097	your	91	” The child dropped her chin , and her shoulders sagged . “
91141	91146	91097	91097	your	91	” Lauren said slowly . “
91156	91163	91097	91097	your	91	” Elsa let out a sob . “
91166	91175	91176	91176	You	91	” Lauren said quickly , pulling herself together . “
91184	91205	91180	91180	You	91	” Instinct kicked in and she pulled Elsa against her body , one hand on the back of her head . “
91210	91211	91180	91180	You	91	” “
91219	91223	91180	91180	You	91	” Elsa cried . “
91231	91235	91180	91180	You	91	” Lauren babbled . “
91254	91255	91256	91256	I	91	” “
91295	91296	91256	91256	I	91	” “
91301	91305	91306	91306	You	91	” Lauren soothed . “
91333	91350	91351	91351	I	91	” It was n’t her most elegant speech , but she was pinch - hitting here . “
91356	91374	91351	91351	I	91	” Elsa sobbed , her narrow shoulders shaking . Lauren ’s eyes welled instantly and spilled over . “
91390	91397	91385	91385	she	156	” She swallowed her own tears . “
91449	91450	91442	91442	I	91	” “
91453	91514	91442	91442	I	91	” Elsa ground out . She convinced Elsa to take a quick shower while she went to look in her luggage for a pad . Luckily , she found one . Often there were only tampons in there . With Elsa standing there in a towel , she gave her a quick explanation of how pads were affixed to underwear . “
91553	91622	91623	91623	I	91	” She did , luckily . Ten minutes later , Elsa was dressed in clean , dry clothes and sitting on her bed looking a little shell - shocked but otherwise fine . It was almost time to head over to the rink , but Lauren took the risky step of climbing onto the bed next to Elsa . She hugged her knees to her chest and sighed . “
91640	91641	91623	91623	I	91	” “
91646	91650	91623	91623	I	91	” Elsa gasped . “
91691	91716	91681	91681	I	91	” Elsa groaned , because the idea of bleeding in front of your classmates was universally acknowledged to be a fate worse than death . “
91745	91755	91737	91737	I	91	” Elsa risked a glance in Lauren ’s direction . “
91759	91764	91737	91737	I	91	” she said gruffly . “
91831	91832	91926	91926	my	91	” “
91837	91887	91926	91926	my	91	” Elsa said , and Lauren had to bite back her smile . There was a crash in the other room , and Lauren jumped . A split second later , Mike appeared in the doorway between the two hotel rooms , his face red , his eyes wild . “
91891	91903	91904	91904	You	963	” he panted . For a second , Lauren just blinked . “
91913	91914	91904	91904	You	963	” “
91947	91948	91949	91949	Omigod	98	” “
91951	91959	91949	91949	Omigod	98	” Lauren said , sitting up straighter . “
91974	91975	91970	91970	We	1547	” “
91980	91989	91970	91970	We	1547	” He bent over and grabbed his knees . “
91998	91999	92000	92000	I	91	” “
92006	92011	92004	92004	Daddy	533	” Elsa said quickly . “
92022	92032	92012	92012	You	533	” He stood up and leaned on the doorjamb . “
92047	92048	92012	92012	You	533	” “
92051	92061	92062	92063	Young lady	481	” Lauren said . His eyes shifted to Elsa . “
92070	92098	92099	92099	I	91	” Lauren tried to meet his gaze and tell him to drop it , but his eyes had a laserlike focus on his daughter . Elsa swallowed . “
92116	92132	92108	92108	I	91	” His expression went from angry to shocked to completely uncomfortable in about two seconds . “
92135	92140	92108	92108	I	91	” he said slowly . “
92149	92155	92108	92108	I	91	” He scratched his chin . “
92166	92167	92168	92168	Yup	123	” “
92170	92175	92168	92168	Yup	123	” Elsa said quickly . “
92186	92187	92168	92168	Yup	123	” “
92190	92194	92168	92168	Yup	123	” he said . “
92197	92201	92168	92168	Yup	123	” Lauren repeated . “
92214	92221	92206	92206	I	91	” He pointed over his shoulder . “
92226	92230	92206	92206	I	91	” Elsa encouraged . “
92234	92265	92206	92206	I	91	” Lauren added . He gave them both one more appraising look . Then he turned around and disappeared . The next sound was the hotel room door shutting again . “
92268	92275	92206	92206	I	91	” Lauren said into the silence . “
92278	92282	92284	92284	you	123	” Elsa whispered . “
92288	92298	92284	92284	you	123	” A hysterical giggle bubbled out of her chest . “
92309	92310	92311	92311	I	91	” “
92314	92329	92330	92330	He	91	” Lauren kept it together for about two seconds before bursting out in laughter . “
92338	92342	92330	92330	He	91	” Elsa giggled . “
92348	92370	92371	92371	We	1551	” Lauren added , her stomach contracting with more laughter . It was a few minutes before they could calm down . “
92381	92382	92371	92371	We	1551	” “
92385	92401	92371	92371	We	1551	” Elsa got off the bed carefully . She looked a little freaked out again . “
92412	92413	92408	92408	your	123	” “
92424	92442	92418	92418	I	91	” Five minutes later they took the elevators downstairs , and Lauren pointed out the lobby shop . “
92454	92462	92418	92418	I	91	” Elsa whispered when they stepped inside . “
92497	92498	92478	92478	men	562	” “
92503	92517	92478	92478	men	562	” Lauren strode right up to the bored looking woman behind the register . “
92530	92531	92534	92534	Lauren	114	” “
92536	92540	92534	92534	Lauren	114	” Elsa hissed . “
92543	92573	92534	92534	Lauren	114	” The woman barely lifted her eyes from her phone . She turned around , grabbed a plastic - wrapped pack of eight and plunked it on the counter . “
92578	92607	92534	92534	Lauren	114	” she said . Everything sold in hotels was such a rip - off . Lauren paid anyway , tucked the pads into her bag and went outside . “
92620	92630	92534	92534	Lauren	114	” The doorman turned to her with a frown . “
92656	92657	92651	92651	you	123	” “
92660	92668	92651	92651	you	123	” Lauren said , turning to Elsa . “
92673	92674	92651	92651	you	123	” “
92677	92758	92651	92651	you	123	” TWENTY - SEVEN Beacon made a giant error by getting into the hotel ’s courtesy car . He ’d been trying to save time , and the guy was right there when he emerged from the hotel ’s front door . But now they were stuck in traffic , and he could n’t even see the arena . The half - mile sprint he ’d done along the river to get to his family ? That had worked fine . “
92767	92772	92773	92773	I	91	” the driver murmured . “
92785	92786	92773	92773	I	91	” “
92789	93006	92773	92773	I	91	” His phone was blowing up with messages , too . WHERE ARE YOU ? the general manager of the team kept texting . That was in addition to Rebecca ’s texts , Jimbo ’s texts , and Silas ’s . Your phone shows that you ’re at the hotel , Becca texted . Or maybe you left your phone at the hotel , and you ’re here in the building ? I hope so . If you get this message , please know that people are freaking out . I hope you ’re in a bathroom stall somewhere meditating . If only . He was truly MIA . When he ’d gotten Lauren ’s message , he ’d looked at his watch and seen an hour before game time . The hotel was ( sort of ) connected to the complex where the arena was . So he just made a run for it . Obviously they ’d noticed . He knew the situation was really dire when the next text was from his agent . Where the fuck are you ? The car inched forward again . Then it stopped . The road in front of them was a sea of brake lights . He leaned over the seat to ask the uniformed driver , “
93023	93024	93025	93025	I	91	” “
93038	93039	93040	93040	You	91	” “
93045	93046	93040	93040	You	91	” “
93050	93055	93056	93056	We	1559	” The man pointed . “
93072	93073	93062	93062	You	91	” “
93076	93112	93062	93062	You	91	” Beacon said , opening the door in stalled traffic . Then he ran . • • • He got back to the dressing room at seven forty - five , sweating like a racehorse . “
93118	93123	93124	93124	I	91	” Coach Worthington spat . “
93128	93169	93124	93124	I	91	” he said , trotting toward his gear in the corner . He bent down and grabbed his ankles , stretching . His entire pregame warmup was shot to hell . His body was warm from the run , though . “
93174	93175	93124	93124	I	91	” “
93186	93191	93181	93181	I	91	” Coach actually growled . “
93220	93230	93208	93208	I	91	” Oh , shit . He straightened up slowly . “
93246	93247	93244	93244	he	402	” “
93250	93255	93244	93244	he	402	” Think , Beacon . “
93272	93273	93244	93244	he	402	” “
93277	93288	93274	93274	I	91	” Coach snarled . It had been an awful game . “
93293	93301	93274	93274	I	91	” Beacon said , thinking out loud . “
93320	93326	93327	93327	I	91	” O’Doul joined the conversation . “
93372	93373	93366	93366	they	376	” “
93388	93404	93366	93366	they	376	” Coach pointed out . He still looked surly , but he also looked intrigued . “
93407	93411	93366	93366	they	376	” Doulie agreed . “
93426	93427	93366	93366	they	376	” “
93440	93468	93433	93433	MIA	278	” Beacon tried to ignore the tidal waves of anger that Coach threw out . He lifted a foot up onto the bench and stretched his hamstring . “
93485	93489	93490	93490	Beak	128	” Doulie said . “
93533	93647	93662	93662	Castro	229	” Beacon kept his mouth shut and stretched the other hamstring . He was too far in the doghouse to say so , but he thought Doulie had a point . The worst thing that could happen would be an early goal against Brooklyn . That would suck , but the other team would assume they ’d just gained a night ’s worth of momentum . That ’s when he ’d skate out to replace Silas , fit as a fiddle , breathing new life into their defensive game . Their momentum would n’t be worth a nickel if it was based on a misunderstanding . Really , it was an intriguing idea . “
93653	93657	93662	93662	Castro	229	” Coach grumbled . “
93670	93698	93664	93664	Trevi	533	” Beacon left his pads at his locker and went to find Silas , who was facedown on a mat in full gear , stretching his hips . “
93701	93711	93664	93664	Trevi	533	” Silas said as soon as he walked in . “
93717	93740	93664	93664	Trevi	533	” Beacon walked right around in front of him and got down into the same position . They were face to face . “
93751	93755	93756	93756	I	91	” Silas grumbled . “
93789	93795	93796	93796	My	91	” Silas chewed his lip . “
93818	93819	93806	93806	Coach	102	” “
93830	93831	93806	93806	Coach	102	” “
93837	93848	93806	93806	Coach	102	” Beacon reached up and punched him in the shoulder . “
93874	93875	93806	93806	Coach	102	” “
93879	93885	93806	93806	Coach	102	” Beacon shook his head . “
93941	93942	93932	93932	Doulie	143	” “
93953	93957	93932	93932	Doulie	143	” Beacon grinned . “
93983	93984	93974	93974	you	1567	” “
93989	93990	93991	93991	I	91	” “
93996	94010	93991	93991	I	91	” It came out a little gruff and Silas ’s young brow furrowed . “
94089	94090	94107	94108	Good man	1573	” “
94093	94101	94107	94108	Good man	1573	” Silas nodded , his jaw set . “
94105	94106	94107	94108	Good man	1573	” “
94110	94119	94107	94108	Good man	1573	” Beacon maneuvered his hips to stretch out . “
94136	94137	94107	94108	Good man	1573	” “
94164	94165	94155	94155	bud	279	” “
94174	94181	94155	94155	bud	279	” He chuckled into the mat . “
94187	94188	94155	94155	bud	279	” “
94193	94200	94205	94205	Silas	402	” said Hugh from the doorway . “
94207	94208	94205	94205	Silas	402	” “
94213	94220	94221	94221	I	91	” Beacon called from the mat . “
94233	94496	94221	94221	I	91	” Silas got up , gave him a salute and strode away . • • • Beacon suited up just as soon as the rest of the guys went out for the pregame announcement and the quick warm - up skate . When he tossed his phone into his locker , the screen held a text from Lauren . We ’re here and we ’re fine and we love you ! There were three heart emojis , but he was more thrilled with the we in that sentence . He strapped on his pads knowing everything was fine in half his universe , at least . But it was time to do battle . It was odd to lace up his skates in an empty dressing room . He had n’t been the backup in ten years . He did n’t show his face until two minutes of game play had elapsed . Then he walked very slowly down the chute and toward the bench , where his teammates gathered . Maybe it was normal for them to gather here , but he never did . It was a little like crashing a party . Henry — the trainer — waved him in and stepped aside so that Beak could maneuver down the row to the last seat in front of the door . The backup ’s seat . He got situated and checked Silas ’s face . The kid ’s eyes scanned the ice , watching plays develop , waiting to lunge into action . His skating looked loose and controlled . “
94500	94622	94221	94221	I	91	” Silas shouted at his forwards when they ’d missed their open man . Detroit was setting up a rush . Beacon felt it , and he saw from Silas ’s body language that the kid between the pipes felt it , too . Come on , buddy . You can do this in game seven the same as you do it in practice . O’Doul made a nuisance of himself , so by the time Detroit got a shot it was n’t much of a shot at all . Silas flicked it away with all the concern of a horse batting a fly with its tail . And just like that the kid made his first save of the night . “
94625	94679	94680	94680	He	1576	” Beacon yelled . Detroit went in for the rebound , but it took them a couple of seconds . Silas had time to get into position and grab the puck right out of the air . The whistle blew , and Silas waited for the ref to collect it from his glove . “
94684	94694	94697	94697	he	1576	” Trevi said under his breath from beside Beacon . “
94700	94841	94697	94697	he	1576	” Beacon agreed . The minutes in the first period ticked down slowly . The Brooklyn team relaxed into the unusual situation , pressing on Detroit as best they could . As Beacon watched , it began to work . His teammates created scoring opportunities against a flustered opponent . They took shot after shot on goal , while Detroit was forced to play defense . Then something amazing happened — O’Doul put one into the net with only two minutes left in the period . And then Trevi got one ninety - two seconds later , with a deke that could have won an Academy Award . The Bruisers fans in the audience erupted with glee . It was 2–0 . After one more faceoff , the team clomped back to the dressing room for the intermission , elated . “
94845	94849	94697	94697	he	1576	” Coach hollered . “
94855	94860	94697	94697	he	1576	” Beacon asked Silas . “
94882	94896	94876	94876	I	91	” Silas removed his helmet and wiped the sweat away with his arm . “
94899	94900	94876	94876	I	91	” “
94940	94957	94958	94958	Ya	1581	” He was right . Beacon was sent in at the start of the second period . “
94962	94972	94958	94958	Ya	1581	” he asked his opponents as they skated past . “
94983	94989	94958	94958	Ya	1581	” Detroit ’s captain muttered . “
94994	95061	95062	95062	Mighta	281	” Beacon called after him . They won game seven 3–1 , and advanced to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in four years . • • • Beacon did n’t leave the rink until midnight . The dressing room had swarmed with reporters after the game , and Beacon told them all he ’d felt a bit ill just before the puck dropped . “
95068	95086	95065	95065	I	91	” he said every time someone asked why he had n’t started tonight . It sounded better than “
95094	95151	95087	95087	I	91	” By the time he ’d boarded the bus , Lauren texted him that Elsa was asleep . And by the time his key card let him into his room , all the lights were out . As he tiptoed through the dark toward the king - sized bed , Lauren rolled over and sat up . “
95154	95158	95087	95087	I	91	” she whispered . “
95163	95236	95087	95087	I	91	” He took off his suit jacket and kicked off his shoes . Then he stripped down to his boxers and padded into Elsa ’s room . His daughter was asleep , hugging her pillow . He kissed her head and then retreated to his room , closing the door behind him and locking it . Then he dropped his shorts and practically did a swan dive into bed with his woman . “
95239	95254	95255	95255	Somebody	154	” she said as he did the military crawl toward her for a kiss . “
95262	95263	95255	95255	Somebody	154	” “
95269	95303	95264	95264	You	154	” The conversation stopped while he plundered her mouth for a few pleasant minutes . Then , with a happy sigh , he rolled to the side and pulled her onto his chest . “
95330	95331	95321	95321	I	91	” “
95336	95341	95321	95321	I	91	” Lauren said softly . “
95363	95364	95360	95360	you	154	” “
95371	95375	95360	95360	you	154	” he joked . “
95394	95395	95381	95381	Hans	120	” “
95402	95419	95381	95381	Hans	120	” Lauren said lightly . He ran his nose along the smooth skin of her forehead . “
95433	95434	95435	95435	They	1584	” “
95459	95467	95440	95440	Elsa	2199	” He laughed into her silky hair . “
95472	95473	95440	95440	Elsa	2199	” “
95482	95490	95492	95492	they	1584	” she asked , sounding awfully worried . “
95498	95499	95500	95500	I	91	” “
95512	95522	95500	95500	I	91	” He put a hand right onto her breast . “
95531	95532	95500	95500	I	91	” “
95536	95537	95538	95538	I	91	” “
95543	95565	95538	95538	I	91	” He rolled , pushing her onto her back . Pushing his hips down against hers , he kissed her again . “
95568	95575	95538	95538	I	91	” Lauren said into his mouth . “
95581	95618	95619	95619	Lo	1597	” It was true that they ’d had some of their most energetic sex after a win . He was always too wired to go to sleep . But sex was n’t his mission right now . “
95621	95627	95619	95619	Lo	1597	” he whispered between kisses . “
95633	95639	95629	95629	you	1597	” She stilled beneath him . “
95647	95655	95629	95629	you	1597	” Slowly , she shook her head . “
95672	95683	95619	95619	Lo	1597	” He sat up , but she grabbed his hands . “
95687	95688	95619	95619	Lo	1597	” “
95691	95702	95619	95619	Lo	1597	” With a groan , she sat up , too . “
95729	95738	95619	95619	Lo	1597	” He threw his head back and laughed . “
95749	95755	95743	95743	I	91	” His laughter died away . “
95773	95783	95767	95767	I	91	” He cupped her soft face in one hand . “
95791	95802	95767	95767	I	91	” she said , turning her head to the side . “
95808	95817	95767	95767	I	91	” He stroked her cheek with his thumb . “
95874	95883	95867	95867	we	1586	” Her eyes widened and then went soft . “
95904	95949	95896	95896	I	91	” In all their years together , nothing she ’d ever said had made him as happy as he was right now . He pulled her into his lap and held her even closer . And when he exhaled , it came out shakily . “
95953	95957	95951	95951	you	1597	” he whispered . “
95967	95968	95969	95969	You	1597	” “
95973	95988	95969	95969	You	1597	” She punctuated her words with a kiss on the underside of his jaw . “
96000	96004	95991	95991	you	1597	” Lauren groaned . “
96011	96012	95991	95991	you	1597	” “
96040	96050	95991	95991	you	1597	” She stroked his back with a gentle hand . “
96079	96080	96083	96083	baby	793	” “
96085	96095	96083	96083	baby	793	” He ran a hand through her silky hair . “
96175	96176	96177	96177	You	2343	” “
96179	96194	96195	96195	You	2343	” She wrapped her arms around him , her eyes glittering in the dark . “
96204	96205	96195	96195	You	2343	” “
96213	96285	96195	96195	You	2343	” He lifted her chin and claimed her mouth . The kiss went lava - hot immediately , too . She threw a knee over his thigh and straddled him . Heaven . He let his hands skim up her body until he was cupping her heavy breasts through the thin fabric of her nightgown . Maybe he was crazy , but she felt bigger already . He broke their kiss . “
96303	96307	96297	96297	I	91	” She laughed . “
96320	96321	96318	96318	you	1595	” “
96326	96327	96318	96318	you	1595	” “
96337	96338	96328	96328	I	91	” “
96341	96355	96356	96356	You	1595	” he yelped , pulling her down and tackling her against the pillows . “
96366	96367	96356	96356	You	1595	” “
96376	96424	96356	96356	You	1595	” Cupping the back of her head , he leaned forward until she tipped all the way onto her back . He spread his body out on top of hers , pinning her hands over her head . Then he kissed her again , deep and slow . “
96433	96448	96429	96429	I	91	” he said a couple of minutes later when they were both breathing heavily . “
96465	96466	96473	96473	woman	1597	” “
96486	96533	96473	96473	woman	1597	” She gave him a shove and he rolled off her . Then she got up and fished a slender box out of her carry - on bag . He hopped up to follow her , but she gave him a stern look at the door . “
96543	96544	96473	96473	woman	1597	” “
96563	96704	96473	96473	woman	1597	” She slipped the test stick out of the box then handed him the documentation . Then she shut the door in his face . • • • In the bathroom , Lauren kicked her underwear off and took a shaky breath . He ’s right , she told herself . Either way , it ’s okay . It was surprisingly hard to pee on a stick without peeing on your own hand , but Lauren managed it . Then , taking care not to glance at the display window on the plastic stick , she flushed the toilet and washed her hands . This day would live forever in her memory as the Day of Bathroom Drama . First Elsa , and now this . The cycle of life was getting a full workout , here . Hakuna matata . “
96711	96720	96473	96473	woman	1597	” Mike counted from outside the bathroom door . “
96726	96727	96473	96473	woman	1597	” “
96744	96750	96473	96473	woman	1597	” Lauren ’s heart shimmied . “
96778	96797	96764	96764	we	1599	” She opened the door to find him standing there , gloriously naked , leaning on the doorframe . “
96804	96819	96764	96764	we	1599	” he counted quietly . His big , kind eyes looked down on her . “
96824	96835	96764	96764	we	1599	” Lauren stood up on her toes and kissed him . “
96840	96900	96764	96764	we	1599	” He kissed her , too , pulling her against his hard body , his erection poking her in the belly . Damn , this man . If the test was negative , she ’d be crushed . But she knew he ’d kiss her and love her until it hurt a little less . He broke their kiss . “
96912	96928	96929	96929	You	1600	” She lingered in his arms a moment longer , prolonging her moment of truth . “
96933	96934	96929	96929	You	1600	” “
96943	96962	96929	96929	You	1600	” He ducked around her using his smoothest defensive maneuvers and grabbed the plastic stick off the counter . “
96965	96971	96929	96929	You	1600	” He pumped his fist . “
96974	96978	96929	96929	You	1600	” Lauren gasped . “
96983	97000	96929	96929	You	1600	” She grabbed the stick out of his hand . The display very clearly read + . “
97009	97010	96929	96929	You	1600	” “
97016	97072	96929	96929	You	1600	” He took the stick out of her hand and tossed it onto the bathroom counter . Then he shut off the light , grabbed Lauren by the hips and lifted her into the air . Two seconds later her butt landed on the bed , and big hands lifted her nightgown over her head . “
97079	97107	97108	97108	I	91	” he said , pushing her back on the mattress . His warm weight landed on her thighs , and he attacked her neck with hungry kisses . “
97114	97148	97108	97108	I	91	” she murmured , her hands running through his hair . Their baby might have his dark , wavy locks . Their baby . Holy cow . What a crazy , wonderful idea . “
97154	97215	97108	97108	I	91	” He grabbed one of her hands and attached it to his erection . He was hot and hard in her hand , and her body did n’t fail to notice . He tongued the valley between her breasts , and goose bumps broke out all over her body . She stroked his cock and let out a happy sigh . “
97226	97239	97108	97108	I	91	” She hooked her heels on his hips and drew him closer . “
97250	97258	97259	97259	I	91	” he said , tonging her nipple . “
97266	97297	97259	97259	I	91	” Her answering giggle died away as he kissed his way down her body . He nudged her thighs apart and placed a very soft kiss right where it counted . “
97300	97326	97327	97327	I	91	” she gasped . And when his tongue came out to play , she clapped a hand over her mouth and bit back a moan . “
97330	97335	97327	97327	I	91	” he said softly . “
97344	97362	97336	97336	We	1601	” But the brush of his play - off beard against her thighs was making her crazy . “
97367	97371	97336	97336	We	1601	” she demanded . “
97377	97392	97336	97336	We	1601	” He gave her a long , lingering lick that made her see stars . “
97395	97427	97336	97336	We	1601	” she panted . One second later , his big , beautiful body rose up over hers . He grasped one of her knees , lifted it and filled her completely . “
97431	97441	97442	97442	I	91	” he said , thrusting his hips right away . “
97453	97521	97442	97442	I	91	” She arched her back and tried not to make any noise , but that was hard to do when you were as full of joy as she was . The things coming out of Mike ’s mouth were cocky , macho boasts . Yet this man knew exactly how it changed your life to have a baby , and he ’d wanted one with her anyway . “
97525	97692	97523	97523	me	91	” she demanded , her eyes wet with happy tears . Without further comment , he did . TWENTY - EIGHT BROOKLYN , NEW YORK JUNE 2016 Mike had been right to celebrate when he had the chance , because the Stanley Cup finals against Dallas were a serious challenge to both his sanity and his body . Three days after their Detroit victory , they lost game one in Dallas . Then , forty - eight hours later , they won the second game . But veteran Beringer sustained a knee injury during the overtime period and was n’t expected to play again until next season . The team flew back to Brooklyn feeling low . By the time they landed at La Guardia , they had just over forty - eight hours to get ready for game three . Beacon called home and asked Hans to pick up four steaks and a bag of charcoal for the grill out in back of the townhouse . “
97695	97696	97697	97697	I	91	” “
97724	97725	97728	97728	Lauren	114	” “
97731	97740	97728	97728	Lauren	114	” Hans asked . These days ? Water . “
97746	97747	97743	97743	You	533	” “
97752	97756	97757	97757	I	91	” Hans agreed . “
97780	97781	97782	97782	She	2199	” “
97785	97798	97782	97782	She	2199	” He rubbed his temple , where a headache threatened to develop . “
97803	97804	97805	97805	I	91	” “
97831	97832	97819	97819	Bach	284	” “
97835	97836	97837	97837	You	533	” “
97861	97862	97865	97865	man	533	” “
97871	97891	97865	97865	man	533	” Beacon tossed his duffel bag onto the back seat of a yellow cab and slid in after it . “
97898	97912	97865	97865	man	533	” he told the driver . His next move was to dial Lauren . “
97916	97923	97865	97865	man	533	” he said when she answered . “
97931	97936	97929	97929	Coach	1605	” she asked immediately . “
97966	97967	97968	97968	I	91	” “
97981	97982	97968	97968	I	91	” “
98004	98011	97996	97996	I	91	” She was quiet a moment . “
98021	98022	97996	97996	I	91	” “
98059	98060	98033	98033	she	2199	” “
98086	98087	98092	98092	I	91	” “
98100	98101	98092	98092	I	91	” “
98112	98113	98092	98092	I	91	” “
98139	98140	98125	98125	You	533	” “
98157	98158	98162	98162	woman	1597	” “
98180	98219	98220	98220	Sweetie	155	” They hung up , and just like that he was feeling upbeat again . • • • The first thing he did upon reaching home was to run up the stairs and knock on Elsa ’s door . “
98231	98237	98227	98227	I	91	” There was no reply . “
98240	98267	98227	98227	I	91	” He turned the doorknob . She was sitting in the center of the bed , her index fingers pushed into the corners of her eyes . “
98274	98285	98227	98227	I	91	” She nodded , but tears leaked down her face . “
98289	98314	98315	98315	I	91	” He was across the room in three paces , sitting on the edge of the bed , wrapping an arm around her shoulders . “
98324	98337	98320	98320	Mom	461	” It actually took him a minute to remember what she meant . “
98340	98357	98358	98358	I	91	” he said stupidly . That freaking letter . Of course it would make her sad . “
98367	98368	98361	98361	she	461	” “
98371	98379	98361	98361	she	461	” she said , her breath shuddery . “
98384	98622	98623	98623	I	91	” She reached under her pillow and pulled it out . She flipped the pages — there were four or five , with Shelly ’s handwriting on both sides . Elsa found the one she was looking for and thrust it at him . This is n’t easy for me to tell you , but I want you to know the truth about why your father and I broke up . I cheated , honey . I went behind your father ’s back to have a relationship with Tad . I ca n’t tell you how much I regret the way I handled it . Deception is never the right way to fix a broken relationship . Maybe my relationship with Daddy was n’t fixable , but now I ’ll never know . He cursed under his breath . I ’m telling you this because you might hear things that are n’t true . Or you might wonder why Daddy moved out , and he might not be willing to tell you . And — this is the most important thing I have to say — if your father finds someone who treats him better than I did , I hope you can make room in your heart to understand that he deserves that . Shit . Elsa leaned into him , crying silently . He passed a hand over his eyes and took a deep breath . “
98638	98671	98629	98629	I	91	” On the one hand , he understood why Shelly had felt the need to be honest with her daughter . But maybe it could have waited five years instead of one . “
98676	98682	98629	98629	I	91	” Elsa sobbed . Right . “
98699	98730	98692	98692	Lauren	114	” Elsa snorted and laughed and cried all at the same time . Mike grabbed a tissue out of the box on her night table and dabbed at her face . “
98760	98761	98762	98762	I	91	” “
98767	98771	98762	98762	I	91	” Elsa stuttered . “
98777	98778	98774	98774	yours	91	” “
98781	98813	98774	98774	yours	91	” He grabbed a second tissue because the first one was already trashed . But when he held it up to her face , Elsa snatched it and mopped up herself . “
98820	98821	98774	98774	yours	91	” “
98829	98830	98774	98774	yours	91	” “
98851	98855	98838	98838	Mine	91	” He sighed . “
98866	98880	98838	98838	Mine	91	” Maybe then this whole letter - reading business would just go away . “
98884	99018	98838	98838	Mine	91	” Mike got up off his bed and climbed the flight to the master suite . He glanced around his bedroom and noted that the cleaning woman had been by . Good . He was n’t inviting Lauren to spend the night in a bachelor ’s dive . It took him a minute to locate the FedEx envelope and slide the letter out . By the time he slid his thumb under the flap and tore it open , Elsa was waiting in the doorway , her eyes on him . The note was just two paragraphs long . Mike — Your letter is short because I ’m not going to bother nagging you to buy organic or to learn to cook something more than pancakes and steak . He burst out laughing . “
99021	99149	99152	99152	Daddy	533	” Elsa yelped , scampering over . He held up a hand to keep her at bay , though , until he ’d read the whole thing . . . . You and I never did things the same way , but I already know you ’re a great dad . I ’m sorry if I upset our girl with my letter , but I had to say it now . Because honey — if she waited for you , go get her back . Life is too damn short . The sacrifice you made for me was extreme , and I want you to know I appreciate it . Now go and be happy while there ’s still time . — S The room went blurry . “
99158	99196	99199	99199	man	533	” Wordlessly , he passed her the note . When Elsa read the first line , she clapped a hand over her mouth . But then she bit her lip , and the tears started up again . “
99201	99208	99209	99209	She	1619	” Those were his thoughts exactly . “
99215	99226	99209	99209	She	1619	” Elsa said , as if to reassure them both . “
99233	99237	99209	99209	She	1619	” he said . “
99259	99272	99273	99273	I	91	” His daughter put her head on his chest and hugged him . “
99279	99280	99273	99273	I	91	” “
99294	99295	99285	99285	I	91	” “
99302	99303	99304	99304	She	124	” “
99313	99314	99309	99309	I	91	” “
99328	99329	99318	99318	I	91	” “
99334	99335	99336	99336	She	124	” “
99349	99353	99343	99343	She	124	” He chuckled . “
99375	99382	99367	99367	she	124	” Elsa squinted up at him . “
99407	99417	99397	99397	I	91	” Yikes . Just like the boys in Dallas . “
99430	99569	99397	99397	I	91	” His daughter gave him a half - irritated look and left the room to go and rummage through her closet . Mike put Shelly ’s note back in its envelope . He tucked it into the top drawer of his dresser , then went to see if Hans was home from the grocery store yet . TWENTY - NINE An hour later Lauren stood in Mike ’s gleaming kitchen slicing the strawberries she ’d picked up on the way here . She ’d also brought pound cake and cream to whip . Until a moment ago , Mike , Elsa , Hans , and Justin had been standing here with her , drinking the first beer of the evening and catching up on news . Hans had told them about his audition for the Miami orchestra tomorrow . “
99587	99588	99577	99577	You	1625	” “
99597	99607	99608	99608	I	91	” Elsa had said with stars in her eyes . “
99613	99722	99608	99608	I	91	” The smile he gave her was so full of love that it broke Lauren ’s heart . This child had been so unlucky to lose her mother at such a tender age . Thank god there were people in her life to help her through it . And who knew that pregnancy would make her so emotional ? This was the third time today that an act of kindness had made her feel all gooey inside . The men were outdoors now in Mike ’s little backyard , and the steaks were on the grill . Elsa came back through the kitchen , and Lauren stopped her . “
99762	99763	99748	99748	I	91	” “
99771	99807	99808	99808	My	91	” The girl ’s eyes darted toward the door , and Lauren could hear the gears turning in her head . She did n’t want to have this discussion in front of Hans and company . “
99816	99827	99828	99828	They	1628	” Lauren said , tipping her chin in that direction . “
99845	99878	99828	99828	They	1628	” Her own hands were sticky with strawberry juice . Elsa darted away , and Lauren finished up the berries . She sprinkled sugar over them , and a squirt of lemon . “
99883	99906	99828	99828	They	1628	” Mike said , coming through the back door , followed by Hans and Justin . He gave her a blinding smile . “
99914	99987	99988	99988	Elsa	2199	” Lauren set the bowl of berries to macerate and rinsed her sticky fingers . She could whip the cream after dinner . She carried her glass of water to the table , which was set for six . Lauren would bet any sum of money that Hans had set it , not Mike . The silverware shone in perfect lines in a way that shouted OCD ! Which Mike was not . “
99990	99997	99988	99988	Elsa	2199	” Mike called toward the stairs . “
100000	100044	100045	100045	Els	186	” He put a steak on Lauren ’s plate , and then Justin passed her the pasta salad , and a bowl of broccoli . For a moment , the four adults waited . Mike got up and walked over to the stairway . “
100056	100067	100048	100048	you	1631	” She returned something that Lauren could n’t make out . “
100072	100080	100048	100048	you	1631	” Mike said , taking his seat . “
100098	100197	100091	100091	somebody	1052	” After the dishes had been passed , Lauren cut into her steak and took a bite . It was excellent . She wondered when she ’d start to feel nauseated by the pregnancy . Apart from a little soreness in her breasts — and a positive pregnancy test — there were n’t any symptoms . Yet . She had her first appointment with the obstetrician a week from today , where she could ask all her questions . It took five or ten minutes until Elsa appeared . She stalked over to the table and sat down . “
100205	100270	100091	100091	somebody	1052	” Mike said , passing her a steak . Elsa gave him dagger eyes , and Lauren marveled . The kid had been cheerful enough a half hour ago . Hell , teenagers were moody . Even Hans could n’t draw her out . When he asked her a couple of gentle questions about her day at school , she gave him monosyllabic answers . “
100279	100288	100289	100289	I	91	” Justin asked , sipping from his glass . “
100304	100305	100299	100301	the wine guy	0	” “
100310	100314	100315	100315	I	91	” Mike said . “
100319	100320	100322	100322	I	91	” “
100326	100330	100331	100331	He	0	” Hans admitted . “
100349	100350	100343	100343	I	91	” “
100357	100367	100368	100368	I	91	” Justin said , laying a hand on his . “
100374	100391	100368	100368	I	91	” Everyone laughed . Except for Elsa . She raised a cool gaze to Lauren ’s . “
100400	100548	100368	100368	I	91	” she challenged . Oh boy . Lauren , stunned by the question , stared across the table at Elsa , who regarded her with a laser gaze . The girl knew . Still tongue - tied , Lauren went over the last hour in her mind . How had she given herself away ? Not everybody accepted a beer when offered one . And she had n’t said a word . She ’d brought Elsa those maxi pads . . . Oh , crap . Her prenatal vitamins were in that bag somewhere . It was entirely possible that Elsa had glimpsed them . There was a big freaking pregnant belly on the label , with a heart drawn on it . And the untouched glass of wine Hans had poured her sat there on the table like a beacon . She felt eyes on her . “
100560	100565	100550	100550	Lauren	114	” Mike said lightly . “
100575	100585	100550	100550	Lauren	114	” Elsa asked . She set down her fork . “
100594	100595	100588	100588	you	1636	” “
100600	100607	100588	100588	you	1636	” Mike muttered under his breath . “
100613	100617	100609	100609	I	91	” Lauren sputtered . “
100623	100624	100588	100588	you	1636	” “
100631	100651	100653	100654	the baby	106	” Elsa stabbed a cherry tomato in her pasta salad as if trying to spear it in the heart . “
100740	100803	100731	100731	she	106	” Elsa jammed the tomato in her mouth and stood up from the table . Then she made her exit with a regal posture which she maintained all the way up the stairs . There was stunned silence at the table then . Nobody even chewed . Mike was the first to shake it off . He looked up at the ceiling . “
100814	100815	100809	100809	Shelly	2023	” “
100818	100834	100809	100809	Shelly	2023	” Lauren said , trying to make sense of it . He shook his head . “
100871	100885	100865	100865	She	2023	” He took Lauren ’s hand under the table , then addressed Hans . “
100896	100897	100891	100892	a baby	1970	” “
100900	100904	100891	100892	a baby	1970	” Lauren corrected . “
100909	100910	100891	100892	a baby	1970	” “
100913	100924	100927	100927	his	1647	” Hans asked . She jerked her head toward Mike . “
100940	100941	100932	100932	I	91	” “
100944	100954	100932	100932	I	91	” the German man said , his smile bashful . “
100975	100976	100968	100968	I	91	” “
100982	100989	100968	100968	I	91	” Mike pointed at the staircase . “
100996	101000	101003	101003	her	1649	” Lauren admitted . “
101019	101020	101014	101014	she	1649	” “
101026	101034	101014	101014	she	1649	” Mike said , squeezing her hand . “
101043	101044	101014	101014	she	1649	” “
101052	101057	101048	101048	I	91	” He just smiled . “
101067	101095	101048	101048	I	91	” He let go of her hand to cut another bite of his steak . Then he picked up her glass of wine and took a sip . “
101103	101104	101048	101048	I	91	” “
101126	101130	101119	101119	I	91	” He smiled . “
101169	101170	101171	101171	You	1244	” “
101178	101187	101171	101171	You	1244	” Chewing , he glanced up the staircase . “
101203	101204	101192	101193	no goalie	1651	” “
101207	101208	101192	101193	no goalie	1651	” “
101218	101324	101213	101213	I	91	” He reached over and gave her knee a squeeze . Goalies , Lauren smiled to herself . So calm in the hailstorm of life . She tried to imagine what life would be like a year from now . No — two years . There ’d be a high chair pulled up to the table . Even if their toddler was throwing peas on the floor and Elsa was having a teenage meltdown , Mike would be smiling at her over the rim of his wineglass , weathering the storm . She felt a rush of love for this man and his easy smile . “
101331	101337	101338	101338	Danke	289	” Mike said to Hans . “
101340	101421	101338	101338	Danke	289	” Lauren stabbed an olive with her fork and felt tears in her eyes . Damn pregnancy hormones . But today they were tears of joy . She ’d take it . THIRTY On his way up to Elsa ’s room fifteen minutes later , he paused to grab a photo album from the bookshelf underneath the TV . Tucking it under his arm , he took the stairs two at a time and then tapped on Elsa ’s door . “
101425	101477	101478	101478	I	91	” she grumbled from the bed . He sat down beside her . Could be worse , he noticed . She was n’t crying , but rather watching a YouTube video of bears invading someone ’s backyard pool . And when she looked up at him , her expression was sheepish . “
101487	101491	101478	101478	I	91	” she said . “
101503	101504	101505	101505	I	91	” “
101509	101525	101505	101505	I	91	” He leaned back against her headboard and opened the photo album on his lap . “
101553	101554	101555	101555	She	461	” “
101558	101562	101555	101555	She	461	” Mike admitted . “
101575	101623	101624	101624	You	91	” He ’d opened the album to his favorite baby picture of Elsa . She was maybe six months old , and wearing a tiny hockey jersey . He was skating across a practice rink with her tucked under his arm . They were both smiling widely . “
101649	101734	101643	101643	I	91	” He flipped the pages slowly . Elsa wearing a paper birthday hat , with icing all over her face . Elsa on her mother ’s lap , reading a bedtime story . The three of them smiling up at the camera from a picnic blanket , Elsa seated on Mike ’s thigh , using his body like a lounge chair . Preschool - aged Elsa , dressed up like an Ewok for Halloween , Mike as Hans Solo and Shelly as Princess Leia . “
101741	101757	101737	101737	we	1655	” Elsa said , but she was smiling . He put an arm around her . “
101773	101858	101859	101859	I	91	” She laid her cheek against his shoulder and said nothing . He turned another page . Elsa ’s first day of kindergarten , holding Mike ’s hand on the way into school on Long Island . Elsa wearing tap shoes and a purple tutu for a dance recital . Elsa holding her very first violin and a stubby looking bow . Shelly hugging Elsa , her eyes closed , a look of pure joy on her face . Beside him , Elsa sniffled . “
101872	101876	101859	101859	I	91	” he whispered . “
101885	101892	101877	101877	We	1658	” Elsa picked her head up . “
101895	101896	101877	101877	We	1658	” “
101945	101963	101939	101939	I	91	” Elsa made a noise of disbelief , the sort that only a teenager can pull off . “
101975	101980	101939	101939	I	91	” he said softly . “
102028	102029	102031	102031	her	156	” “
102033	102037	102039	102039	her	156	” Elsa whispered . “
102044	102045	102046	102046	Them	1662	” “
102048	102049	102053	102053	twins	1353	” “
102059	102060	102055	102055	You	1664	” “
102065	102072	102061	102061	I	91	” Elsa said , sounding teary . “
102076	102085	102087	102088	grumpy teenagers	1666	” He tucked her closer to his chest . “
102107	102108	102113	102113	him	120	” “
102115	102116	102113	102113	him	120	” “
102122	102123	102113	102113	him	120	” “
102138	102139	102136	102136	he	120	” “
102142	102146	102136	102136	he	120	” Mike admitted . “
102169	102170	102157	102157	Lauren	114	” “
102177	102181	102157	102157	Lauren	114	” Elsa demanded . “
102190	102194	102157	102157	Lauren	114	” He laughed . “
102209	102219	102205	102205	I	91	” She elbowed him , and he laughed again . “
102232	102233	102205	102205	I	91	” “
102236	102264	102266	102266	Lauren	114	” he said . Whatever changes were coming , there was no need to call off the vacation he and Elsa had been planning for a year . “
102271	102279	102280	102280	She	114	” He had to think about that . “
102335	102336	102325	102325	She	114	” “
102355	102356	102357	102357	Elsa	2199	” “
102359	102363	102357	102357	Elsa	2199	” he laughed . “
102370	102371	102364	102364	I	91	” “
102377	102381	102364	102364	I	91	” she finished . “
102399	102407	102421	102421	honey	963	” He grinned up at her ceiling . “
102427	102428	102423	102423	I	91	” “
102434	102438	102423	102423	I	91	” Mike smiled . “
102485	102486	102487	102487	I	91	” “
102512	102513	102514	102514	We	1673	” “
102530	102531	102532	102532	I	91	” “
102542	102547	102532	102532	I	91	” his daughter teased . “
102552	102580	102581	102581	Daddy	533	” He put his fingertips at the side of her ribcage and tickled her . She resisted mightily for a moment , until a giggle busted out . “
102585	102586	102581	102581	Daddy	533	” “
102589	102889	102890	102890	You	1678	” She shrieked , and he knew she ’d be okay . • • • Two nights later , Lauren , Elsa , and Hans watched from seats just behind the penalty box as Brooklyn lost to Dallas in game three of the finals . Brooklyn took the game all the way into overtime with a 1–1 score , but Dallas got lucky with an unlikely bounce , disappointing all the local fans . Lauren missed the next game , because it was on the same evening as her graduation . I ca n’t believe I ’m missing your graduation , Mike had texted earlier in the day . Honestly , I ’d rather watch the game , she replied . But my parents are coming , as is my ninety - year - old grandmother , and I have n’t seen her for months . I ’ll be thinking about you . Do n’t ! she quickly replied . Think about the puck instead . If you win , I ’ll sneak into your house later to help you celebrate . And if I lose ? :( Then you have to sneak into mine . And — hey — I need Castro ’s autograph . It ’s for the night doorman ’s daughter . But not my autograph ? Sure , honey . I ’m sure she ’d like yours too . You ’re hard on my ego . Even when I ’m moaning your name ? Okay , not then . See you tonight . :) As it happened , Brooklyn won game four about an hour after the dean read Lauren ’s name . The series was tied 2–2 , and the giddiness Lauren felt made it easier to survive a late dinner with her parents . “
102896	102901	102894	102894	dear	1678	” her mother said , “
102911	103134	102908	102908	your	1678	” Lauren took another sip of her water glass , wishing there was Scotch in it . Or maybe tequila . Her mother ’s greatest talent was missing the point . The color of her cap and gown could n’t matter less . She ’d put herself through college without their help . To celebrate her victory over their lack of generosity with tuition money , her parents had decided to take her out to an insanely expensive restaurant . Her father ordered a pricey bottle of champagne , of which she had three sips because she was not about to disclose her pregnancy . That conversation could wait until her clothes were n’t fitting anymore , or at least until she and Mike figured out how the next few months were going to work . After the dessert course , her Katt Phone buzzed with a message . Excusing her rudeness , she checked to find a text from Mike . Do n’t come to Brooklyn , I ’m coming to you . Her chest fluttered with excitement , and suddenly the evening became more bearable . Ca n’t wait ! Good game tonight . Wish I could have seen it . You ’ll get your own personal highlight reel a little later . She smiled and put her phone away . “
103140	103154	102908	102908	your	1678	” she announced to the table . Her father made a sour face . “
103174	103183	103184	103187	the new guy ”	1679	” Lauren could n’t guess who he meant by “
103187	103257	103258	103258	I	91	” when there were so many possibilities : Nate , who ’d fired him , Hugh who ’d been promoted into his old job , or Coach Worthington . She did n’t bother to clarify because it was so obvious that her father was a bitter old man . The team had gotten further than anyone expected this year , and would likely kill it next year , too . “
103263	103271	103258	103258	I	91	” she said instead of engaging him . “
103287	103288	103280	103280	I	91	” “
103294	103307	103280	103280	I	91	” her elderly grandmother said , nodding sleepily from across the table . “
103321	103326	103280	103280	I	91	” her mother mused . “
103332	103344	103330	103330	gran	91	” Lauren said , ignoring her mother and rising to leave . “
103350	103362	103330	103330	gran	91	” And now it was really time to make her exit . “
103368	103381	103330	103330	gran	91	” her father said , pulling an envelope out of his pocket . “
103384	103385	103387	103387	you	91	” “
103389	103466	103387	103387	you	91	” She tucked it into her bag , where her cap and gown had been stuffed after the ceremony . She kissed her parents quickly and went home to wait for Mike . • • • An hour or so later they lay in a sweaty heap together , catching their breath after an enthusiastic romp on her bed . She kissed the slightly furry centerline of his chest , then laid her cheek on it . “
103476	103487	103488	103488	You	91	” he asked suddenly . Her heart skipped a beat . “
103494	103495	103498	103498	I	91	” “
103501	103510	103498	103498	I	91	” His hand sifted clumsily through her hair . “
103538	103539	103530	103530	your	91	” “
103552	103565	103530	103530	your	91	” He hauled up his chest so he could see her face . “
103589	103596	103597	103597	I	91	” She smiled down at him . “
103617	103626	103612	103612	They	1686	” He let out a bark of laughter . “
103632	103633	103629	103629	you	91	” “
103668	103669	103670	103670	I	91	” “
103675	103676	103677	103677	You	91	” “
103680	103681	103677	103677	You	91	” “
103697	103698	103699	103699	I	91	” “
103708	103712	103699	103699	I	91	” she whispered . “
103726	103727	103730	103730	you	91	” “
103734	103738	103730	103730	you	91	” he chuckled . “
103744	103745	103730	103730	you	91	” “
103768	103772	103779	103779	her	2199	” He snorted . “
103782	103783	103784	103784	I	91	” “
103797	103798	103799	103799	Elsa	2199	” “
103813	103819	103799	103799	Elsa	2199	” Lauren lifted her head . “
103824	103833	103834	103834	I	91	” His handsome face broke into a smile . “
103879	103880	103873	103873	we	1689	” “
103883	103890	103873	103873	we	1689	” She snuggled against him again . “
103907	103908	103909	103912	The four of us	1695	” “
103914	103925	103909	103912	The four of us	1695	” he corrected , placing a hand on her belly . “
103928	103934	103937	103937	Lo	1597	” She relaxed against him . “
103964	103970	103937	103937	Lo	1597	” Her throat got tight . “
103981	103982	103937	103937	Lo	1597	” “
104017	104018	104010	104010	Nobody	1886	” “
104025	104030	104010	104010	Nobody	1886	” she said quietly . “
104061	104062	104054	104054	you	1697	” “
104070	104088	104054	104054	you	1697	” She grinned against his warm skin , and he gave her a pat on the rump . “
104105	104106	104091	104091	you	1697	” “
104109	104110	104091	104091	you	1697	” “
104117	104124	104091	104091	you	1697	” Mike made a choking noise . “
104132	104133	104091	104091	you	1697	” “
104137	104164	104091	104091	you	1697	” She knew she sounded like the worst stubborn brat on the planet right now , but the man was the worst sort of control freak . “
104185	104217	104218	104218	You	1697	” Thinking about it almost made her feel twitchy with anger again . Almost . She could n’t quite muster up the outrage while Mike stroked her skin with patient hands . “
104223	104229	104230	104232	That vile man	91	” He cleared his throat . “
104260	104268	104271	104271	you	1697	” Now there was a freaky idea . “
104274	104279	104271	104271	you	1697	” she said quickly . “
104307	104308	104309	104309	You	1697	” “
104313	104318	104309	104309	You	1697	” he said sleepily . “
104325	104387	104309	104309	You	1697	” The next sound he made was a snore . THIRTY - ONE The next morning Lauren woke up to a flurry of texts from Nate . The investment bankers had found a third bidder for Nate ’s router division . Nate — and therefore Lauren — was going to see a presentation from the new bidder first thing that morning . “
104390	104402	104403	104403	Whassamatter	295	” Lauren said , perched on the edge of the bed . “
104405	104427	104403	104403	Whassamatter	295	” Mike asked into the pillow . She took a moment to appreciate the geography of his back muscles before answering . “
104458	104468	104469	104469	Bummer	196	” He lifted his chin and squinted at her . “
104489	104512	104476	104476	you	196	” That handsome face dropped into the pillow again . She crawled onto the bed and kissed the back of his neck . “
104524	104525	104476	104476	you	196	” “
104555	104568	104569	104569	I	91	” He reached out and took her hand in his warm one . “
104581	104604	104569	104569	I	91	” She lay down beside him again , if only for another minute . He rolled and curved his body around hers . “
104619	104620	104621	104621	I	91	” “
104631	104632	104628	104628	I	91	” “
104640	104641	104628	104628	I	91	” “

104683	104692	104693	104693	Nate	91	” Mike lifted his head off the pillow . “

104735	104741	104742	104742	I	91	” She shook her head . “
104807	104815	104816	104816	You	196	” He was quiet for a moment . “
104825	104826	104816	104816	You	196	” “
104844	104857	104816	104816	You	196	” Mike kicked a leg over her hip , pulling her closer . “
104870	104871	104872	104872	Me	91	” “
104877	104902	104872	104872	Me	91	” • • • She had a long day at work , which stretched into the evening . Lauren had been assigned the task of “
104906	104916	104919	104920	the bankers	2748	” the new bidder ’s claims about its company . “
104926	104931	104919	104920	the bankers	2748	” she asked Nate . “
104981	104982	104969	104969	I	91	” “
104988	105124	104969	104969	I	91	” It was the second time in as many weeks that she ’d been asked to perform a task above her pay grade . She was glad Nate had begun to trust her with more interesting work , but the timing was a little dicey . If he wanted to talk about the California job again soon , she ’d have to spill her secret . There had been many nights when Lauren worked late , assisting Nate and an analyst or two . This time she was the analyst . They did n’t leave the office until ten , and Lauren went in at seven thirty the next morning because she knew Nate had to leave early . He took several meetings that morning , then sat following up with Lauren in his office . “
105149	105150	105135	105135	I	91	” “
105153	105209	105135	105135	I	91	” Lauren felt a pang of jealousy . A big one . Nate was flying out on his Gulfstream just in time to see game five , and coming home again in the morning . And she was n’t . Her tentative plan to surprise Mike in Dallas had been sidelined by the new bidder . “
105238	105243	105232	105232	we	1712	” her boss suggested . “
105248	105259	105232	105232	we	1712	” She spoke before she could second - guess herself . “
105274	105280	105267	105267	I	91	” Nate ’s eyes widened . “
105284	105289	105267	105267	I	91	” she said quickly . “
105294	105315	105290	105290	We	1712	” She and Nate were close but it was a little audacious to invite herself along on his charter jet . “
105318	105327	105290	105290	We	1712	” he said , rising from his chair . “
105357	105358	105347	105347	I	91	” “
105375	105379	105380	105380	I	91	” she teased . “
105402	105412	105413	105413	Reallly	297	” This drew a Nate smirk from her boss . “
105415	105416	105413	105413	Reallly	297	” “
105422	105423	105413	105413	Reallly	297	” “
105454	105455	105442	105442	I	91	” “
105461	105474	105442	105442	I	91	” He snapped his laptop shut and shoved it into its case . “
105493	105494	105480	105480	We	1717	” “
105504	105505	105480	105480	We	1717	” “
105548	105549	105535	105535	I	91	” “
105555	105556	105535	105535	I	91	” “
105566	105567	105535	105535	I	91	” “
105578	105579	105535	105535	I	91	” “
105583	105584	105535	105535	I	91	” “
105588	105617	105535	105535	I	91	” They argued all the way to the elevators . • • • When they reached the charter terminal , Lauren was astonished to see Becca waiting there . “
105634	105644	105535	105535	I	91	” Becca gave an oddly self - conscious shrug . “
105669	105670	105661	105661	I	91	” “
105678	105684	105661	105661	I	91	” Becca dropped her voice . “
105724	105725	105726	105726	He	91	” “
105730	105731	105726	105726	He	91	” “
105734	105735	105736	105736	Ladies	1724	” “
105741	105767	105739	105739	we	1717	” Their fearless leader escorted them onto the sleek little jet . There were only a few seats , as well as a conference table . “
105774	105778	105770	105770	I	91	” Lauren asked . “
105788	105792	105779	105779	You	1724	” Nate frowned . “
105801	105917	105779	105779	You	1724	” Lauren sat down on one side , with Nate opposite . Becca set herself up in one of the plush chairs and pulled out a copy of Vanity Fair . Lauren did n’t quite understand the purpose of Becca ’s trip to Dallas . But , hey , it made her own hitchhiking a little less weird . She and Nate worked for a good hour and a half until the lone flight attendant announced that she would serve dinner soon . Lauren had been smelling food for the past half hour , and it was strangely unappealing . Her stomach felt sour , which was odd . Flying had never bothered her before . “
105929	105935	105920	105920	I	91	” the flight attendant said . “
105954	105968	105969	105969	I	91	” Nate and Becca ordered , but Lauren tried to wave her off . “
105980	105981	105978	105978	you	1724	” “
105998	106011	105978	105978	you	1724	” Becca pointed out . She and Nate were staring at her . “
106022	106046	106014	106014	I	91	” Lauren said slowly . Bread was the only thing that appealed to her at the moment . Even the salad sounded wrong . “
106055	106056	106049	106049	I	91	” “
106059	106690	106049	106049	I	91	” Becca sat down at the table beside Nate , who put away his computer . The flight attendant offered everyone wine , and nobody accepted . Lauren was glad that she rarely drank at work functions . It would make her pregnancy - induced sobriety seem less peculiar . Unfortunately , when the food was delivered , Lauren ’s queasiness did not improve . Nate had asked for the Thai beef . It looked beautiful — slices of meat over a bed of noodles , bright green snow peas mixed in . But the scent just hit Lauren all wrong . She broke off a bite of bread and buttered it . She put it in her mouth and chewed . A moment later , the flight attendant opened the door to the little galley kitchen and all the food smells intensified . Suddenly there was too much saliva in Lauren ’s mouth . With shaking hands she shoved her seatbelt off . Bile began to climb her throat as she slid out of the seat and dove toward the jet ’s bathroom . She made it just in time , slamming the little door and sliding the lock which activated the lights . Miraculously , she hit the toilet dead center , vomiting up what little was in her stomach . Holy crap . What a wretched time for morning sickness to announce itself . Lauren wiped her mouth on a paper towel and tried to think . Her pregnancy book had warned that nausea often hit during week six , or four weeks after conception . Standing there over the toilet , trying to decide whether or not she was going to puke again , she did the math . She was two days into week six . Jeez . It took a while until Lauren was ready to venture out of the bathroom . After she was sure the awful moment had passed , she washed up again and used one of the disposable mouthwash packets provided in the fancy medicine cabinet . She looked herself over in the little mirror . She was a little pale , and her eyes were red from watering , but otherwise she looked no worse for wear . Nevertheless , she felt exposed , as if she wore a label on the lapel of her suit jacket reading : pregnant and freaked out . Feeling paranoid , Lauren opened the bathroom door just a crack , hoping to find her dinner companions distracted by their work or a movie . They were distracted all right — Nate held Becca ’s face in two hands , and he was whispering softly to her . Lauren held her breath , wondering if he would kiss her . But after a moment , he sat back . Lauren eased the door shut , counted to thirty and then banged it open before emerging . Wearing her best poker face , she moved slowly back toward the table . Nate and Becca were sitting side by side , ignoring each other again . Of course they were . All their entrees had been cleared away already , praise the Lord , except Lauren ’s roll and butter were waiting . Without a word , Lauren sat down and tore the roll in half . Her stomach felt as empty as the Grand Canyon during a drought . And although she had zero experience with morning sickness , she knew without a doubt that bread would steady her . Hmm . The pregnancy book had annoyed her with the number of times it had said , listen to your body . But her body demanded bread , and it wanted it right this second . “
106695	106716	106049	106049	I	91	” Nate asked when it became clear that she was n’t going to volunteer any information about her violent disappearance . “
106719	106737	106049	106049	I	91	” She took another bite of the roll , and no bread had ever tasted so good . “
106745	106801	106802	106802	I	91	” She lifted her eyes to his and found worry . Nate was quite fastidious . During flu season he always asked her to distribute bottles of Purell all around the office , and he used it liberally . He was probably thirty seconds away from breaking out a hazmat suit and scrubbing his hands . “
106806	106811	106812	106812	You	1727	” Lauren said quietly . “
106821	106864	106812	106812	You	1727	” He did not look convinced . Lauren ate the rest of her roll in about two seconds flat . The waitress came back to ask if she ’d like the gazpacho that she had n’t gotten around to serving her before . “
106870	106881	106812	106812	You	1727	” Lauren said , uncertain about eating something so savory . “
106895	106896	106899	106899	miss	106	” “
106901	106912	106899	106899	miss	106	” Becca added before the young woman turned to go . “
106922	106923	106899	106899	miss	106	” “
106932	106984	106927	106927	I	91	” Lauren leaned back against the headrest and closed her eyes . She felt much better now , but she did n’t trust it . When would the nausea strike again ? Another roll was delivered , and the flight attendant put a small pile of saltines in front of Becca . “
106992	106996	106997	106998	Mr. Kattenberger	301	” she inquired . “
107012	107018	106997	106998	Mr. Kattenberger	301	” He shook his head . “
107026	107027	106997	106998	Mr. Kattenberger	301	” “
107035	107055	107057	107057	me	91	” Lauren said suddenly . The bubbles were just what she needed . Nate leaned forward in his seat . “
107059	107060	107057	107057	me	91	” “
107063	107064	107057	107057	me	91	” “
107081	107082	107071	107071	You	91	” “
107090	107175	107083	107083	I	91	” she said , closing her eyes again . At this rate , her little secret would last two more days , tops . Nate was very observant , even if he did not have a clue what the early stages of pregnancy looked like . When her diet soda arrived , Lauren took a deep pull . The flavor was n’t to her liking , but the effervescence was nice . She ate the other roll slowly , and continued to feel better . “
107183	107194	107195	107195	You	91	” she asked her boss . He frowned at her . “
107219	107225	107226	107226	You	91	” Lauren shook her head . “
107253	107254	107244	107244	You	91	” “
107273	107283	107284	107284	Nate	91	” Becca tried and failed to hide a smile . “
107293	107308	107284	107284	Nate	91	” She might as well just spill her secrets now , in relative privacy . “
107318	107326	107327	107327	Omigod	98	” He squinted at her , confused . “
107329	107333	107327	107327	Omigod	98	” Becca laughed . “
107347	107358	107339	107339	he	91	” She pushed the little pile of saltines toward Lauren . “
107372	107373	107327	107327	Omigod	98	” “
107376	107399	107401	107401	you	91	” Lauren picked up one of the cracker packets and held it . That did make sense . Prepackaged insta - carbs . “
107403	107404	107401	107401	you	91	” “
107408	107415	107401	107401	you	91	” Becca said with a smile . “
107428	107474	107477	107477	Jesus	730	” Becca cleared her throat . Nate was silent for another split second . But then , because he really was one of the smartest men on the planet , he made a noise of surprise and bumped his head back against the head rest . “
107479	107484	107477	107477	Jesus	730	” Then he laughed . “
107493	107497	107487	107487	Nate	91	” Becca said . “
107503	107504	107498	107498	I	91	” “
107507	107511	107498	107498	I	91	” Nate chuckled . “
107514	107515	107498	107498	I	91	” “
107519	107529	107498	107498	I	91	” Lauren did n’t know what else to say . “
107562	107563	107564	107564	I	91	” “
107570	107574	107564	107564	I	91	” Becca said . “
107585	107592	107579	107579	I	91	” Nate turned to her sharply . “
107595	107596	107579	107579	I	91	” “
107599	107604	107579	107579	I	91	” she said cheerfully . “
107607	107648	107579	107579	I	91	” Nate regarded Becca with the familiar , undisguised intensity that he saved only for her . Lauren shoved another bite of roll in her mouth and wondered how many episodes of the Nate and Becca show she ’d missed . “
107651	107655	107579	107579	I	91	” Becca hedged . “
107682	107727	107675	107675	I	91	” She gave Nate a potent smile . Lauren closed her eyes , realizing that she might be the third wheel tonight . Maybe if she had n’t hitched a ride to Dallas , they ’d be joining the mile high club right now . “
107735	107749	107675	107675	I	91	” Nate asked eventually , his long fingers fiddling with a silver pen . “
107752	107776	107777	107777	I	91	” Lauren agreed . She passed him the folder they ’d put aside before dinner . He took it , but then hesitated . “
107797	107801	107777	107777	I	91	” She winced . “
107811	107823	107777	107777	I	91	” His smile was warm . Warm for Nate , anyway . “
107862	107863	107850	107850	you	91	” “
107878	107879	107868	107868	I	91	” “
107914	107915	107916	107916	Nate	91	” “
107918	107923	107916	107916	Nate	91	” Her stomach quivered . “
107926	107986	107987	107987	Y’all	304	” He gave her an evil grin over the file folder , and she rolled her eyes . • • • Lauren arrived in Dallas without tossing her cookies again . A hired car took them directly to the athletes ’ entrance to the stadium , where Becca ’s chirpy intern greeted them with passes to a corporate box . “
108025	108030	108015	108015	I	91	” the girl rambled . “
108034	108038	108039	108039	I	91	” Lauren said . “
108047	108060	108039	108039	I	91	” Becca gave her an odd look , and Lauren cackled inwardly . “
108066	108077	108062	108062	we	1737	” Nate asked , pointing toward a set of escalators . “
108080	108104	108062	108062	we	1737	” Lauren agreed , hefting her overnight bag onto her shoulder . Nate removed it immediately , settling it onto his own shoulder . “
108107	108111	108112	108112	I	91	” Lauren squawked . “
108117	108118	108112	108112	I	91	” “
108121	108130	108112	108112	I	91	” He put his free arm around her . “
108135	108136	108137	108137	I	91	” “
108142	108143	108137	108137	I	91	” “
108150	108158	108137	108137	I	91	” They walked a few paces together . “
108174	108175	108177	108177	you	1735	” “
108179	108180	108184	108184	lady	1735	” “
108190	108247	108184	108184	lady	1735	” As they stepped onto the escalator , he pulled her a little closer , so they ’d both fit . And then he startled her by giving her a peck on the cheek before releasing her . But not before the sound of a rapid - fire camera shutter sounded on the mezzanine above her . “
108257	108262	108248	108248	You	1735	” Lauren pointed out . “
108274	108275	108248	108248	You	1735	” “
108288	108289	108279	108280	Mike Beacon	2343	” “
108298	108306	108294	108296	chicks dig scars	1738	” Lauren said , quoting Evel Knievel . “
108311	108889	108294	108296	chicks dig scars	1738	” THIRTY - TWO Beacon was in the zone tonight . Nothing existed but the game . He squinted against the ice ’s white glare , clocking the puck , calculating play probabilities like a boss . Outside the crease , the world kept on spinning . Time marched forward . People loved him , or did n’t . None of it mattered , but for eleven other players and a six ounce rubber disk . He listened for the slice of blades against frozen water and for the slap of the puck off the boards . The crowd was a dull roar in the distance . Unimportant . The score was tied 2–2 in the third period . His boys wanted it , though . He could see their hustle . It was going to pay off , so long as they kept it up . There were people in his life who mattered . But during game time , they were relegated to the edges of his consciousness . A hockey game lasted a few hours , no more . When he was done here , they could have him again . Elsa . Lauren . The new baby . They ’d have his full attention just as soon as this game was in the bag . Dallas made an attempt on goal , their center rushing the net while the left wing attempted to disguise his hopes at a wrister . Denied . He flicked it away like a bad idea . His boys took it off his hands on the rebound and pressed it down the ice . And this time Dallas ’s defense was n’t ready . Finally , finally , Trevi sank it . And that was that — the end of the overtime period and the end of the game . They now led the series 3–2 , and Dallas could n’t close the gap . One game closer to the Cup . One more win . We ’re still fucking in it , he told himself as his teammates swarmed after the buzzer . We ’re still alive . He liked to think he appreciated it a little more than the younger kids . Nobody knew when their number was up — not in hockey , and not in life . The best you could do was live hard and be grateful . After the handshake line , he followed his sweaty teammates to the dressing room . He showered in a tired daze and put on his suit . Then , unfortunately , Georgia corralled him onto the dais for the press conference . There went another half hour . The win was awesome , but if his teammates decided to do some hard drinking tonight , he was going to sneak out after the first beer . There were just two more games left in the season . Then he could spend more time with his girls . He could n’t wait . Publicity finished , he walked through the mobbed hallway . Players , families , and journalists all crowded the place . He wove carefully through the crush of bodies , locked on the exit like a heat - seeking missile . But someone grabbed his arm a few paces before he reached the door . When he turned , he saw the best sight ever . Lauren , with a smile on her face . “
108895	108903	108892	108892	You	1739	” He grabbed her into a hug . “
108911	108912	108892	108892	You	1739	” “
108918	108919	108920	108920	Yay	176	” “
108922	108947	108920	108920	Yay	176	” He gave her the first kiss of the evening , and it was every bit as happy - making as winning the game . “
108952	108968	108920	108920	Yay	176	” he said , suddenly twice as impatient to leave as he ’d been before . “
108977	108983	108920	108920	Yay	176	” He shook his head . “
108997	109030	108988	108988	You	1739	” He took her by the hand and led her outside , where the street curved past a couple of restaurants and office buildings on the way to the Ritz - Carlton . “
109044	109048	109035	109035	Nate	91	” She groaned . “
109066	109076	109078	109078	I	91	” She filled him in on her nausea woes . “
109085	109093	109078	109078	I	91	” he joked , squeezing her hand . “
109110	109144	109102	109102	I	91	” Next week . It sounded like the distant future . By then , the Cup would be won or lost . Although the world would keep turning on its axis either way . “
109164	109165	109153	109153	they	1744	” “
109175	109176	109168	109168	I	91	” “
109179	109194	109168	109168	I	91	” he stopped walking , and she turned to him with an eyebrow raised . “
109197	109198	109168	109168	I	91	” “
109226	109230	109212	109212	I	91	” He snorted . “
109266	109267	109254	109254	I	91	” “
109270	109280	109254	109254	I	91	” Lauren mused , squeezing his hand in hers . “
109299	109300	109287	109287	I	91	” “
109315	109355	109295	109296	the baby	106	” He was probably overselling it , but he was desperate to know if he ’d have a daughter or a son . Either one would be grand , but every new kernel of news was exciting to him . “
109358	109367	109295	109296	the baby	106	” she said , and his heart leapt . “
109382	109391	109392	109392	You	1751	” Beacon threw back his head and laughed . “
109396	109397	109392	109392	You	1751	” “
109400	109415	109392	109392	You	1751	” Lauren said suddenly , squeezing his hand , and stopping on the sidewalk . “
109418	109422	109392	109392	You	1751	” she whispered . “
109426	109502	109392	109392	You	1751	” he asked , sotto voce . She pointed . Ahead of them , the sidewalk passed the curved facade of an office building , with a nearly deserted plaza outside it . A couple had paused there under a street light , the man ’s hands on the woman ’s waist . As they watched , he leaned forward to give her a lingering kiss . Lauren made an excited little squeak beside him . “
109509	109510	109505	109505	Nate	91	” “
109515	109519	109521	109521	honey	274	” he agreed . “
109530	109537	109521	109521	honey	274	” Her glance cut toward him . “
109548	109549	109542	109542	You	274	” “
109559	109567	109550	109550	You	274	” he said with a quiet chuckle . “
109592	109599	109578	109578	I	91	” She gave him a smile . “
109605	109606	109578	109578	I	91	” “
109631	109632	109623	109623	he	1753	” “
109636	109640	109623	109623	he	1753	” Lauren giggled . “
109643	109644	109623	109623	he	1753	” “
109647	109663	109623	109623	he	1753	” he agreed , but only because he could see the hotel in the distance . “
109672	109692	109623	109623	he	1753	” Lauren squinted toward Nate and Rebecca , who were now walking toward the hotel , hand in hand . “
109697	109698	109623	109623	he	1753	” “
109721	109730	109715	109715	nobody	1886	” She wrapped an arm around his back . “
109734	109824	109825	109825	Trevi	533	” And it was . THIRTY - THREE EIGHT MONTHS LATER There was a delay boarding the team jet in St. Louis . The Bruisers were in the middle of a six - day road trip , so the players were n’t feeling bent out of shape by the holdup . They were n’t racing home to their girlfriends or families . Tonight would mean another hotel bed and another team dinner . Beacon was feeding quarters into a claw machine , trying to win a stuffy for Elsa . “
109839	109840	109843	109843	man	1931	” “
109845	109856	109843	109843	man	1931	” he chuckled , holding up Beacon ’s Katt Phone . “
109859	109920	109843	109843	man	1931	” The video was for Elsa ’s benefit . Because he ’d finally figured out how to position the claw properly before lowering its metallic jaws toward the toys . She ’d freak if this worked . He fed in the quarters and began the work of angling the jaw into the corner where the toys were piled the highest . “
109927	109936	109938	109938	he	533	” Trevi narrated for the video ’s benefit . “
109946	109947	109938	109938	he	533	” “
109954	109964	109967	109967	baby	793	” he said to himself , dropping the claw . “
109969	109973	109967	109967	baby	793	” Trevi enthused . “
109976	109987	109967	109967	baby	793	” the kid whooped as the claws closed around something . “
110002	110021	110025	110025	he	533	” The mechanical arm jolted , lifting not one but two toys in its steel teeth . Unbelievable . “
110031	110035	110025	110025	he	533	” Trevi said . “
110045	110072	110025	110025	he	533	” Unbelievably , both the pig and a little blue bulldog dropped into the corner where the chute was . Mike yanked them out and laughed . “
110079	110090	110025	110025	he	533	” Trevi said , pointing the camera in his face . “
110109	110134	110102	110102	Your	793	” The kid tapped the screen to stop the video and handed it to Mike . The screen read Lauren . He answered quickly . “
110145	110146	110147	110147	I	91	” “
110155	110156	110147	110147	I	91	” “
110165	110175	110162	110162	you	793	” She was n’t due for another ten days . “
110197	110201	110193	110193	I	91	” She laughed . “
110204	110205	110206	110206	I	91	” “
110222	110223	110193	110193	I	91	” “
110226	110242	110193	110193	I	91	” He smiled into the phone even as the reality of the situation set in . “
110253	110254	110193	110193	I	91	” “
110270	110279	110264	110264	I	91	” He heard a voice in the background . “
110296	110305	110289	110289	He	91	” Mike heard her speak sharply to Nate . “
110323	110324	110289	110289	He	91	” “
110331	110372	110373	110373	I	91	” He had two car companies on speed dial for this very purpose . And the dog - eared pregnancy book on their bedside table at home had warned that contractions would kick in pretty hard after her water broke . “
110393	110394	110395	110395	I	91	” “
110410	110411	110413	110413	you	1764	” “
110417	110461	110462	110462	Becca	357	” There was a click and she was gone . He stood there a moment longer , phone in hand , just trying to catch up with the sudden U - turn his day had just made . Then he spun into action . “
110464	110469	110462	110462	Becca	357	” She came running . “
110474	110475	110476	110476	Lauren	114	” “
110487	110504	110481	110481	I	91	” Becca gave an excited little shriek , and pulled a tablet out of her bag . “
110520	110521	110481	110481	I	91	” “
110528	110542	110525	110525	I	91	” Silas asked , walking up and giving Mike ’s shoulder a squeeze . “
110552	110553	110554	110554	You	1764	” “
110565	110566	110562	110562	You	1764	” “
110583	110773	110577	110577	I	91	” Silas jogged off , a smile on his face . The team would call up a third goalie from Hartford to fly to Ontario as Silas ’s backup . The team would survive without him for a game . He had more important business to attend to . Mike turned around to find his carry - on . He ’d forgotten about the two stuffed toys clutched in his fist . But now he marveled at them . The pig was pink and silly , the bulldog a little more serious , with big eyes . He knew a good omen when he saw one . • • • It took him five hours to get to New York , and another hour in traffic to NYU ’s hospital . She ’d texted him her room number on the labor and delivery ward , but the place was a maze , and he ran through the corridors feeling like an idiot . Finally he found room 412 , popping his head inside to find Lauren in a bed wearing a hospital gown and a freaked - out expression . “
110776	110792	110577	110577	I	91	” he said , dropping his duffel and sitting on the edge of the bed . “
110798	110799	110800	110800	I	91	” “
110808	110817	110800	110800	I	91	” she said , grabbing for his hand . “
110839	110855	110824	110824	They	1768	” She pointed at an IV bag which dripped a clear fluid into her wrist . “
110865	110866	110824	110824	They	1768	” “
110870	110876	110824	110824	They	1768	” He kissed her forehead . “
110882	110883	110824	110824	They	1768	” “
110888	110892	110824	110824	They	1768	” she sighed . “
110908	110924	110824	110824	They	1768	” she panted . He removed her suit jacket and hung it on a hook . “
110931	110932	110933	110933	I	91	” “
110942	110946	110933	110933	I	91	” she gasped . “
110952	110973	110974	110974	I	91	” As he watched , her face creased from pain . She took a deep breath and blew it out . “
110978	111025	111026	111026	I	91	” he said uselessly , pulling her big belly against his chest . She wrapped her arms around his back and groaned . He rubbed her lower back , and she seemed to relax a little . Eventually she sat back and let out a sigh . “
111037	111043	111026	111026	I	91	” A nurse ran in . “
111049	111062	111063	111063	She	1771	” she greeted Mike . He shook her hand and introduced himself . “
111077	111078	111083	111083	him	91	” “
111085	111090	111083	111083	him	91	” the nurse offered . “
111108	111117	111101	111102	the baby	106	” Lauren said , sighing against her pillows . “
111120	111134	111101	111102	the baby	106	” It killed him to think of her in pain because of him . “
111143	111163	111137	111137	I	91	” He fingered the hospital gown , which had bunnies on it . She gave him a weak grin . “
111182	111183	111177	111177	I	91	” “
111197	111210	111194	111195	the baby	106	” He kissed her forehead two more times , just for luck . “
111231	111232	111233	111233	I	91	” “
111236	111243	111244	111244	Mike	2343	” she mumbled against his shirt . “
111271	111272	111263	111265	one of us	1773	” “
111275	111297	111263	111265	one of us	1773	” He put his chin on her shoulder and reached his arms around , stretching to rub her very swollen belly . “
111306	111317	111263	111265	one of us	1773	” He rubbed his new baby through her taut skin . “
111343	111344	111329	111331	a dozen doctors	1775	” “
111347	111389	111392	111392	baby	793	” She relaxed against him for a couple of minutes . Then he heard her suck in her breath . Beneath his hands , her tummy grew even tighter as the contraction hit . Wow . The human body was astonishing . “
111394	111402	111392	111392	baby	793	” She exhaled in a great gust . “
111408	111409	111410	111410	I	91	” “
111413	111549	111410	111410	I	91	” Though he did n’t really . And the last time he ’d sat in a hospital room with a laboring woman , he was n’t even legal to drink . All he remembered from that experience was Shelly screaming at him , and then his first sight of Elsa ’s tiny face , red and wet and shrieking right after she was born . It was n’t terrifying until they ’d handed him that tiny baby , and he realized that nothing would ever be the same . From that point on , he was responsible for three lives , not just his own . Fast forward almost a decade and a half , and he knew now that this right here was the good stuff . Responsibility is the flip side of joy . “
111556	111570	111410	111410	I	91	” a smooth - faced doctor asked on his way into the room . “
111579	111583	111584	111584	You	91	” Mike joked . “
111586	111587	111584	111584	You	91	” “
111590	111599	111584	111584	You	91	” Lauren panted . The younger man grinned . “
111622	111623	111614	111614	you	91	” “
111630	111634	111635	111635	I	91	” Lauren panted . “
111640	111646	111635	111635	I	91	” Dr. Phelps smiled again . “
111662	111965	111650	111650	I	91	” Doctors and nurses came and went as Lauren breathed through contractions , waiting for her body to push the puck toward the goal . The only scary moment was when the anesthesiologist asked Lauren to brace herself against Mike ’s chest and hold still so he could perform his procedure . Mike held tightly to her body and stared pointedly at the doctor who was busy inserting the needle into the spine of the love of his life . Careful , he inwardly threatened . But it went fine , and Lauren was able to relax as her pain became more manageable . Mike left the room only once to make some calls . He let Lauren ’s mother know the baby was coming . He called Hans to make sure he ’d made it to the house to stay the night with Elsa . Their favorite manny was living in a different Brooklyn neighborhood with his boyfriend , but he frequently came over for practice sessions with Elsa , or just for dinner . When the OB decided Lauren was ready to push , a lovely nurse came to perch at Lauren ’s side . Mike ’s job was to hold one of her knees for each contraction . It was two in the morning . He and Lauren had both been up for twenty hours . She grimaced with every push , and a sheen of sweat glistened on her forehead . Yet she ’d never looked more beautiful to him , and he ’d never been more at peace . It was pitch dark outside the hospital window . In spite of the presence of the doctor and the nurse , he felt as though he and Lauren were cocooned here together . A championship team of two . “
111969	111973	111974	111975	The baby	106	” Lauren panted . “
111979	111984	111974	111975	The baby	106	” the doctor announced . “
111993	111994	111986	111986	you	1780	” “
111997	112001	111986	111986	you	1780	” Lauren gasped . “
112009	112014	111986	111986	you	1780	” The doctor laughed . “
112029	112040	111986	111986	you	1780	” Tears welled in her eyes during the next contraction . “
112045	112094	111986	111986	you	1780	” he whispered , wiping sweat off her forehead with his shirt sleeve . But she did n’t seem to hear him . She closed her eyes and dug deep and bore down . He braced her heel in one hand and rubbed her back with the other . “
112099	112104	111986	111986	you	1780	” the doctor encouraged . “
112131	112172	112173	112174	Baby boy	2689	” A boy . Mike thought of the blue bulldog in his duffel bag , and just knew . Lauren made a low noise from deep in her chest and tensed her face . A minute later the doctor said , “
112184	112192	112173	112174	Baby boy	2689	” The nurse handed him a towel . “
112201	112329	112199	112199	Dad	372	” The next sound he heard was a thin little cry . Lauren closed her eyes and smiled . And the room went a little blurry . • • • Later , Lauren would n’t be able to remember the next hour . She was just too tired . The moment she heard her son cry , she relaxed against the pillow and let everyone else take over . The doctor was n’t done with her , either . He said something about the placenta and some stitches . She put her feet in the stirrups when they asked her to and let the doctor and nurse do all the work . In the corner , Mike stood with a pediatrician , smiling over the baby scale . “
112333	112338	112199	112199	Dad	372	” her husband chuckled . “
112345	112346	112199	112199	Dad	372	” “
112351	112370	112371	112371	I	91	” the pediatrician said , and Lauren closed her eyes . The baby ’s cry sounded angrier now . “
112376	112391	112374	112374	you	1784	” Mike said , his low voice the sweetest sound she ’d ever heard . “
112410	112450	112394	112394	Mommy	2653	” She was too tired to laugh . When she opened her eyes again she saw Mike seated in a chair under the window , the swaddled baby nestled in one arm . The nurse patted Lauren ’s hand . “
112472	112473	112460	112460	He	1784	” “
112476	112487	112488	112488	I	91	” Lauren slurred . The nurse helped her sit up . “
112496	112519	112520	112520	He	1784	” Mike complained . Then he gave her a huge smile , the kind that shook her out of her exhausted daze . “
112526	112582	112520	112520	He	1784	” The nurse laid the baby right across Lauren ’s deflated stomach . For the first time she looked down into the red , wrinkled face of her son , who looked back at her with blinking eyes . She did n’t realize she was crying until Mike grabbed a tissue and dabbed her face . “
112587	112591	112583	112583	I	91	” she gasped . “
112601	112602	112597	112597	he	1784	” “
112609	112614	112597	112597	he	1784	” the nurse sympathized . “
112622	112666	112617	112617	you	91	” Mike agreed , giving Lauren a private grin . Her new baby opened his little mouth and clamped it over her nipple when the nurse guided his head into place . Lauren watched with wonder while his little mouth began to work . “
112674	112707	112670	112670	i	91	” Mike encouraged . The nurse got out of the way , and Mike sat down beside the bed . He propped an elbow on the bed and smiled up at her . “
112714	112715	112709	112709	I	91	” “
112719	112724	112725	112725	I	91	” she said quickly . “
112730	112731	112725	112725	I	91	” “
112757	112764	112748	112748	We	1788	” His big dark eyes begged . “
112769	112778	112748	112748	We	1788	” He grinned and pulled out his phone . “
112801	112810	112787	112787	we	1788	” He aimed the camera lens at her . “
112822	112830	112811	112811	You	91	” Exhausted from labor , Lauren groaned . “
112839	112982	112983	112983	They	1790	” The eye roll she gave him was captured for a photo that would end up on the mantel in their bedroom for decades to come . Messes and all . Do n’t miss the first book in the Brooklyn Bruisers series ROOKIE MOVE Available now ! Continue reading for a preview . In the HR office , Leo filled out approximately seven thousand forms . There were contact forms and health forms . Tax documents . A public relations survey — favorite charities and past experience . The stack of paperwork was endless . Yet if Coach Karl had his way , he ’d be on the next plane to Michigan . When Leo took a break to raise his agent on the phone , the man confirmed that Coach Karl could send him back to the minors at his whim . “
112994	112998	112983	112983	They	1790	” he said , “
113033	113034	113025	113025	They	1790	” “
113043	113047	113025	113025	They	1790	” he asked . “
113051	113056	113057	113057	I	91	” the agent hedged . “
113092	113095	113057	113057	I	91	” Jesus . “
113100	113124	113057	113057	I	91	” he grumbled . After that uplifting conversation , and his hour in the HR office , Becca brought him a shiny box . “
113127	113131	113057	113057	I	91	” she said . “
113141	113167	113168	113168	I	91	” He lifted the lid to find a large , sleek , nearly weightless titanium phone . At least he assumed it was a phone . “
113182	113188	113168	113168	I	91	” She covered her mouth . “
113222	113223	113216	113220	a member of the team	1798	” “
113226	113237	113216	113220	a member of the team	1798	” If only he knew how long that would be . “
113300	113301	113294	113294	Your	1797	” “
113305	113350	113294	113294	Your	1797	” Leo said , fingering the device ’s cool edge . Talking on this thing would be like holding a large slice of bread up to the side of his face . But that was a small price to pay to join the team . “
113370	113374	113375	113375	You	1797	” Becca continued . “
113414	113415	113416	113416	Groovy	313	” “
113418	113419	113416	113416	Groovy	313	” “
113425	113429	113416	113416	Groovy	313	” Becca offered . “
113483	113484	113473	113473	Nate	91	” “
113488	113489	113473	113473	Nate	91	” “
113518	113529	113819	113819	man	533	” She whispered this last bit , and Leo grinned . “
113532	113539	113819	113819	man	533	” She clapped her hands once . “
113550	113762	113763	113763	Gentlemen	1807	” She led him past a big open room which was set up for a press conference — with a table at one end and rows of folding chairs lined up all the way to the back of the room . Beyond that , she opened another door to reveal a large lounge area , with sofas and a pool table . It was a gorgeous , comfortable room , and it was full of hockey players wearing suits and purple ties — the team color for the Brooklyn Bruisers . Several heads turned in his direction , and Leo was confronted with the reality that this should have been a really exciting moment for him — meeting his new NHL teammates . But Coach Karl had robbed him of that joy . In order to become a true member of this team , it would be an uphill battle against all of Karl ’s objections . He did n’t know if it was possible , but he ’d die trying . And hey , he comforted himself , scanning the guys in this room , at least if Karl succeeds at tossing your ass by the end of the day , you ’ll never have to wear a purple tie . “
113765	113785	113763	113763	Gentlemen	1807	” Becca said , clapping her hands . A couple of conversations stopped , heads turning in their direction . “
113801	113808	113795	113796	Mr. Kattenberger	301	” There was a murmured chorus of “
113810	113812	113819	113819	man	533	” and “
113815	113816	113819	113819	man	533	” “
113821	113885	113819	113819	man	533	” A player waved from the sofa , and Leo recognized him as the team ’s current captain , Patrick O’Doul . At thirty - two years old , he ’d been scoring for this team long before Nate bought it and brought it to Brooklyn . They ’d had a difficult couple of seasons , but it was n’t O’Doul ’s fault . “
113888	113892	113819	113819	man	533	” Leo said . “
113898	113948	113949	113949	He	533	” He wanted to be a member of this team so fucking bad . But walking into this room was n’t a moment of victory — it was more like the preparation for battle . Knowing that did n’t make Leo feel like the friendliest guy in the world . “
113957	113961	113949	113949	He	533	” Becca said . “
113980	114032	113970	113970	we	1810	” O’Doul transferred a toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other , gazing up at Leo with his hands at the back of his head . Maybe he affected an easy disposition , but Leo could still see him sizing up the new guy , looking for weakness . “
114042	114106	114033	114033	Put	314	” he said finally . Until that moment , Leo had n’t properly appreciated the fact that getting a crack at the NHL was like being the recipient of a donor organ — someone else had to suffer to give him his big break . Hopefully he would n’t be offering up a lung to some other soul before the day was out . “
114120	114124	114107	114108	The publicist	387	” Becca said . “
114133	114134	114107	114108	The publicist	387	” “
114141	114142	114137	114137	I	91	” “
114148	114153	114137	114137	I	91	” O’Doul asked lazily . “
114189	114199	114179	114180	my dad	1816	” O’Doul held up a hand to silence him . “
114217	114218	114205	114205	Kattenberger	91	” “
114221	114222	114205	114205	Kattenberger	91	” “
114235	114239	114227	114227	you	1813	” O’Doul winked . “
114328	114329	114321	114321	you	1813	” “
114334	114342	114343	114343	I	91	” The captain had an evil grin . “
114388	114389	114384	114384	you	1826	” “
114410	114416	114419	114422	an Ivy League boy	1623	” O’Doul ’s expression chilled . “
114428	114453	114419	114422	an Ivy League boy	1623	” Somebody has a chip on his shoulder . Looking for a change of topic , Leo nodded at O’Doul ’s purple rep stripes . “
114464	114471	114472	114472	You	1830	” O’Doul tugged on his tie . “
114497	114501	114485	114485	We	1832	” Leo laughed . “
114507	114508	114513	114513	kid	1623	” “
114572	114575	114553	114553	they	1834	” Ugh . “
114579	114580	114581	114583	The last guy	402	” “
114652	114674	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” No , actually . It could not be worse , even if the coach was his dead aunt Maria Theresa . “
114683	114690	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” He pointed to the corner . “
114705	114706	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” “
114709	114733	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” Leo made his way over to the corner , stopping every few feet as the guys reached out to shake his hand . “
114736	114744	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” he said a half dozen times . “
114750	115178	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” But he probably was n’t all that convincing . Wait until they watched a snarling Coach Karl ship his ass back to Michigan . That would be a fun moment . They ’d all be wondering what the hell he did to piss off Coach . Leo would be wondering , too . Once upon a time , he and Coach Worthington were tight . Karl had been a college coach then , but he ’d done some development work with Leo ’s high school team . The man had taught him a lot , and had always had time for Leo . At the same time , Leo was dating his daughter , Georgia . There are some dads who hate their little girl ’s boyfriend on principle . But Coach Karl had n’t seemed like that sort of dad . And anyway , Leo had treated Georgia like a queen until the day she ’d broken his heart . When Leo looked back on high school , loving Georgia was actually the one thing in his life he knew he ’d done right . Maybe he was n’t as good a big brother to his siblings as he should have been . And maybe he was a pain in the ass to his teachers . But Leo had been really good to Georgia Worthington , from the moment he asked her to the homecoming dance their sophomore year until the day of high school graduation , when she cut him loose . It was n’t quite as simple as puppy love running its course , though . A few months before graduation , something terrible had happened to Georgia , and Leo was n’t around to stop it . The last part of their senior year , they ’d both suffered . And sometime during those dark days , Coach Worthington stopped approving of Leo . At the time , Leo had been too worried about Georgia to wonder much about her father ’s change of heart . His disapproval meant nothing to Leo — there’d been only Georgia and her pain . He ’d stuck by her side , loyal to the very end . Goddamn it , he was good to her . Then she ’d pushed him away . And now Leo was standing in front of a glass refrigerator full to the top with water and Gatorade , his fists clenched , upset all over again by the anguish he ’d tried to put aside for the last six years . “
115188	115195	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” a voice said beside him . “
115200	115201	114641	114644	another Long Island guy	1840	” “
115204	115243	115244	115244	I	91	” he said gruffly . He realized he ’d been staring at the row of bottles as if they ’d provide the secrets of the universe . He yanked open the door and snagged a bottle of water . “
115249	115262	115246	115247	Silas Kelly	402	” the guy beside him said , thrusting out a meaty hand . “
115266	115270	115246	115247	Silas Kelly	402	” Leo shook . “
115283	115293	115280	115281	a Bruiser	1844	” God , that sounded ridiculous . Silas grinned . “
115315	115316	115280	115281	a Bruiser	1844	” “
115319	115320	115321	115321	I	91	” “
115346	115357	115360	115360	you	402	” The backup goalie job was n’t an easy one . “
115362	115366	115360	115360	you	402	” Leo said . “
115384	115395	115372	115373	Coach Karl	91	” He laughed , and it was big and loud . “
115403	115404	115405	115405	We	1848	” “
115410	115422	115405	115405	We	1848	” Even if I ’m not quite sure what it is . “
115432	115438	115425	115425	you	402	” Leo shook his head . “
115442	115451	115452	115454	Gentlemen , ”	3200	” The door to the room banged open . “
115454	115725	115452	115454	Gentlemen , ”	3200	” said a female voice . He turned toward the doorway , his fingers freezing midtwist on the cap of the water bottle as he stared at the girl in the doorway . No — scratch that . At the woman in the doorway . His chest seized , because Jesus Christ . Georgia was even more beautiful than she had been six years ago . She addressed the team . He thought so , anyway . But he did n’t hear a word she said , because he was too busy cataloging everything that was familiar about her . Adulthood had thinned her face a little , revealing cheekbones so shapely that they might have starred on the cover of a magazine . His ex had always been a pretty girl , but now she was stunning . Her blond hair had darkened somewhat , but it was still shot through with golden streaks . He knew exactly how silky it would feel under his hand if he brushed it away from her face . There were unfamiliar parts to this picture , too — her stern expression , for one . He ’d always hoped that Georgia had gone on to find her smile again , even if he was n’t the lucky recipient . But he did n’t see any evidence of smiling now . And she was all dressed up in a suit and filmy blouse . And heels . His Georgia never wore stilts like that . They made her legs look a mile long . They were killer . But they were n’t her . “
115786	115830	115835	115835	captain	782	” His brain was still playing catch - up . If Georgia was talking about the press conference , she must work for the team . An assistant ? A publicist ? O’Doul raised his hand , a goofy smile on his face . “
115837	115849	115835	115835	captain	782	” Georgia asked with an edge of impatience in her voice . “
115866	115867	115855	115857	our new coach	1855	” “
115872	115881	115855	115857	our new coach	1855	” she said , eyes on her clipboard . “
115908	115912	115919	115919	babe	95	” O’Doul grinned . “
115927	115932	115922	115922	he	771	” Her expression darkened . “
115942	115947	115939	115940	Mr. O’Doul	320	” she said coolly . “
115991	116112	115983	115983	I	91	” She flipped to another page on her clipboard and extracted a sheet of paper , handing it to him . She actually had to lean down a bit , because her shoes made her so much taller than usual . Leo was openly staring now , but he could n’t help it . She looked both the same and different . Her legs , always shapely from playing tennis all her life , looked ten miles long in those heels . But there was something about her that was . . . harder . She seemed more brittle than he remembered . She had n’t looked at him yet , either . Did she even know he was here ? “
116125	116133	116114	116114	I	91	” O’Doul asked , skimming the page . “
116145	116146	116114	116114	I	91	” “
116154	116158	116114	116114	I	91	” He chuckled . “
116164	116165	116114	116114	I	91	” “
116170	116180	116114	116114	I	91	” She cleared her throat and shifted her weight . “
116195	116221	116114	116114	I	91	” Georgia dropped her eyes to the page in front of her again . As if she needed notes to get Leo ’s name right . “
116249	116250	116222	116224	Mr. Leonardo Trevi	321	” “
116254	116305	116222	116224	Mr. Leonardo Trevi	321	” O’Doul said . Leo saw Georgia gather herself together . She took a deep breath and looked straight at him , as if she ’d known exactly where he was the whole time . They locked eyes for a nanosecond before she blinked and broke off their staring contest . “
116315	116346	116309	116309	you	1861	” she demanded . After six years , that ’s what she wanted to say first ? Her terseness took Leo by surprise , delaying his answer by a beat . “
116361	116400	116401	116401	Someone	606	” He smiled at her , hoping to put her at ease . I know this is weird , Gigi . But we can survive it . But , damn it , her face shut down even more . “
116406	116496	116401	116401	Someone	606	” she snapped , looking down at the watch on her smooth wrist . And , hell , he knew that watch . He ’d bought it for her with nearly all his savings . It had been a graduation present . He ’d stood in Saks Fifth Avenue for a long time trying to figure out which was the most beautiful . He ’d been so desperate to make her smile that spring . He would have done anything . Given her anything . It had n’t worked . “
116500	116508	116509	116509	I	91	” Georgia said , her voice gruff . “
116554	116570	116571	116571	Dibs	323	” Then she turned around and strode out of the room in those unlikely shoes . “
116580	116584	116571	116571	Dibs	323	” Silas yelled . “
