5066	5081	5063	5063	Hartley	86	“ What do they put up there when you lose ? A middle finger ? ”
5082	5085	5086	5086	Trevi	372	“ Nope . ”
5091	5118	5086	5086	Trevi	372	“ It ’s just a void where the star should be . And it ’s weird , but I kind of hate knowing it ’s missing . ”
5119	5127	5128	5128	Georgia	1098	“ Then the mind games are working , ”
5131	5138	5128	5128	Georgia	1098	“ The man is a genius . ”
5190	5202	5182	5182	her	376	“ Mr. O’Doul , how is your pain level this evening ? ”
5205	5217	5182	5182	her	376	“ I ’m fine . I ’ve been stretching really well . ”
5266	5314	5260	5260	she	376	“ Henry spoke to me on his way out the door tonight . He told me to be sure to get you on the table five times in the next seven days . But I ca n’t do that if you do n’t set up some appointments . ”
5315	5318	5319	5319	he	372	“ Right , ”

5436	5451	5425	5425	She	441	“ I took some ibuprofen . I ’ll use some ice before I sleep . ”
5471	5478	5465	5465	he	372	“ How ’s your ankle healing ? ”
5483	5493	5494	5494	She	441	“ Oh , really well . Almost like new . ”
5499	5513	5514	5514	She	441	“ How ’d you break it , anyway ? I never caught that . ”
5520	5535	5514	5514	She	441	“ By being stupid . Tripped on a set of steps in my apartment . ”
5536	5539	5544	5544	her	441	“ Ouch . ”
5578	5591	5571	5571	he	372	“ Did you fall all the way down a flight of stairs ? ”
5592	5613	5614	5614	She	441	“ Nope . And I installed a night - light in the hallway , so it wo n’t happen again . ”

5631	5674	5571	5571	he	372	“ Okay , I guess ? Ask Rebecca . She ’s the one who ’s keeping track . She wants me to pick out flowers this week , except she gets mad when I just point to the first thing we see . ”
5675	5678	5679	5679	Leo	372	“ Flowers ? ”
5687	5696	5679	5679	Leo	372	“ How could those be a big decision ? ”
5697	5700	5701	5701	Georgia	1098	“ Right ? ”
5704	5726	5701	5701	Georgia	1098	“ Do n’t worry your pretty head over it . You just focus on hockey and stay in your happy place . ”
5727	5738	5739	5739	Leo	372	“ Did I mention how much I love this woman ? ”
5748	5770	5771	5771	He	372	“ She does n’t care that I do n’t care about flowers ! Am I winning at life , or what ? ”
5777	5783	5784	5784	Georgia	1098	“ You are , honey , ”
5787	5811	5784	5784	Georgia	1098	“ Carry on with your important discussion about hiding each other ’s jock straps or whatever . Ari and I have got this . ”
5847	5864	5865	5865	Hartley	86	“ How ’s Callihan ? When is she going to move to Boston and marry you ? ”
5868	5879	5865	5865	Hartley	86	“ What are you , a marriage evangelist , now ? ”
5880	5884	5885	5885	Trevi	372	“ Born again , ”
5888	5899	5900	5900	Hartley	86	“ I ’ve played on three teams in three years , ”
5903	5966	5900	5900	Hartley	86	“ I ca n’t wait to shack up with Callihan , but we ’re waiting until it looks like I might be able to stay put somewhere for more than a season . She ’s got a great job in Chicago , too . Another year there will only make it easier for her to find a job in Boston or wherever . ”
5967	5976	5977	5978	His friend	443	“ Uh - huh . Sounds like stalling . ”
5987	5995	5977	5978	His friend	443	“ Let ’s sober - dial her . ”
5996	6001	6002	6002	Georgia	1098	“ What is that ? ”

6083	6086	6047	6047	Trevi	372	“ Hello ? ”
6097	6114	6115	6118	The three of them	448	“ Omigod ! Look who it is ! Trevi — I want to meet your girlfriend ! ”
6167	6177	6178	6178	he	80	“ I think it ’s time to turn in , ”
6183	6190	6191	6191	she	376	“ You take care of yourself , ”

7070	7074	7075	7075	he	484	“ Got it , ”
7369	7374	7361	7361	She	376	“ C’m on in , ”
7410	7412	7399	7399	She	376	“ Daughter ”
7428	7432	7433	7433	he	609	“ Pearl Jam ? ”
7439	7446	7447	7447	she	376	“ You do n’t like it ? ”
7476	7483	7484	7484	he	609	“ No , I love it , ”
7487	7511	7484	7484	he	609	“ Once I tried to get a massage at a hotel , and they were playing harp music . My ears were bleeding . ”
7512	7521	7522	7522	Ari	376	“ Okay , no harps . Got it . ”
7620	7627	7606	7606	He	609	“ How long does this take ? ”
7635	7652	7628	7628	Ari	376	“ Sixty minutes , usually . And I have n’t killed anyone yet . I swear . ”
7653	7658	7659	7659	His	609	“ Okay . Sorry . ”
7694	7745	7746	7746	She	376	“ I ’m going to ease toward your hip flexor strain , okay ? I ’ll want to relax the surrounding muscles , so they do n’t contribute to your pain . You ’ll let me know if anything hurts , and if you do n’t approve of the pressure . ”
7807	7819	7790	7790	she	376	“ Just checking in , here . How ’s the pressure ? ”
7820	7823	7824	7824	he	609	“ Okay , ”
7957	7960	7961	7961	she	376	“ Patrick , ”
7971	7988	7961	7961	she	376	“ Are you in pain ? Massage does n’t have to hurt to do you good . ”
7989	7993	7994	7994	he	609	“ No pain , ”
8000	8012	7998	7998	Liar	116	“ You ’re fighting me , though . Why is that ? ”
8013	8016	8017	8017	he	609	“ Uh , ”
8032	8052	8017	8017	he	609	“ That ’s the . . . trouble spot , right ? Why would I want someone touching it ? ”
8063	8068	8069	8069	Ari	376	“ Well . . . ”
8087	8129	8130	8130	He	609	“ Because I can help you ? I wo n’t hurt you , I promise . Careful massage can reduce inflammation , and relax surrounding muscles , too . Is it possible that you had a bad experience with massage before ? ”
8145	8160	8130	8130	He	609	“ Nah . I just do n’t like having , uh , weak spots . ”
8161	8169	8182	8182	She	376	“ Everyone does , though , right ? ”
8170	8181	8182	8182	She	376	“ I suppose . But I do n’t grab yours . ”
8228	8231	8232	8232	she	376	“ Hey , ”
8235	8261	8232	8232	she	376	“ You told me a few minutes ago that you ’d tried to get a massage at a hotel once . What happened that time ? ”
8262	8268	8269	8269	He	609	“ Did n’t work out . ”
8276	8285	8269	8269	He	609	“ It ’s not you , I swear . ”
8286	8305	8306	8306	He	609	“ Why did n’t it work out ? Besides the harps . Why did you book a massage ? ”
8317	8360	8306	8306	He	609	“ I ’d slept funny on the jet , and my neck hurt . No big deal . So I booked a massage at the spa . Left after ten minutes . I guess I just do n’t like hands on me . ”
8361	8370	8371	8371	He	609	“ You do n’t like to be touched . ”
8377	8387	8371	8371	He	609	“ It is n’t my favorite thing , no . ”
8421	8426	8427	8427	she	376	“ Everybody ’s different , ”
8431	8452	8427	8427	she	376	“ But we still have to work on your hip flexors . I have one idea that might help you . ”
8453	8456	8457	8457	He	609	“ Good . ”
8463	8470	8457	8457	He	609	“ Because I ’m fresh out . ”
8501	8537	8538	8538	He	609	“ Let ’s try a more active technique . It will feel more like a gym exercise and less like massage . Can you roll onto your good side and bend your knee for me ? ”
8568	8578	8579	8579	He	609	“ Bend this knee a little more for me . ”
8582	8598	8599	8599	She	376	“ All right . I ’m going to brace your outer hip . Like this . ”
8618	8636	8637	8637	He	609	“ And you ’re going to put your own hand on the trouble spot . Show me . ”
8651	8660	8661	8661	She	376	“ Now , do n’t use your back . ”
8670	8693	8661	8661	She	376	“ Do n’t activate these . Instead , use your hip and leg . Press down and straighten that leg . Go . ”
8711	8719	8720	8720	She	376	“ Good ! How ’d that feel ? ”
8742	8747	8720	8720	She	376	“ Not too bad . ”
8748	8760	8761	8761	He	609	“ You would n’t lie to me , captain , right ? ”
8768	8773	8761	8761	He	609	“ No , ma’am . ”
8774	8798	8799	8799	She	376	“ Ugh . You ma’amed me like an old woman . Just for that you ’re going to do it four more times . ”
8805	8808	8799	8799	She	376	“ Bend . ”
8809	8814	8761	8761	He	609	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
8815	8822	8799	8799	She	376	“ For that ? Six times . ”
8823	8828	8829	8829	She	376	“ Yes , master . ”
8882	8888	8877	8877	his	609	“ Ready , big guy ? ”
8889	8892	8893	8893	he	609	“ Ready , ”
8896	8901	8893	8893	he	609	“ Push and go . ”
8926	8929	8918	8918	he	609	“ Okay ? ”
8930	8946	8947	8947	Ari	376	“ Yeah . It feels a little looser than it did a half hour ago . ”
8973	8980	8981	8981	she	376	“ Now roll onto your stomach , ”
8984	9005	9006	9006	Chuckling	117	“ For fifteen minutes I want you to pretend you enjoy massage . Just to stroke my ego , okay ? ”
9050	9056	9057	9057	she	376	“ How am I doing ? ”
9060	9066	9057	9057	she	376	“ Feel free to lie . ”
9067	9081	9082	9082	She	376	“ Aw . This is the best massage I ’ve had all year . ”
9089	9098	9082	9082	She	376	“ This is the only one , right ? ”
9099	9105	9106	9106	He	117	“ Yeah , but still . ”
9145	9170	9125	9125	she	376	“ Do you have much pain here ? The risk with a hip strain is that you ’ll overcompensate by using your lower back . ”
9171	9187	9125	9125	she	376	“ By the end of a game , I ’m feeling it there for sure . ”
9203	9297	9194	9194	She	376	“ Okay . At your next visit , we ’ll keep working on these trouble spots . Each time you put on a burst of speed on the ice , you demand a lot from these muscles . If we keep you loose , it ’s going to help . I ’m going to work into your hip a little now — but only from the back . And I ’m not going to hurt you . And you ’re lying on the trouble spot , right ? No one can touch it . ”
9313	9321	9322	9322	They	504	“ Got it . Do your worst . ”
9378	9380	9375	9376	Eddie Vedder	118	“ Black ”
9605	9608	9609	9609	he	506	“ Okay , ”
9615	9618	9609	9609	he	506	“ Thanks . ”
9619	9622	9623	9623	she	376	“ Here , ”
9636	9649	9623	9623	she	376	“ You do n’t want to get massage oil on your clothes . ”
9683	9690	9691	9691	she	376	“ See you tomorrow in Detroit , ”
9697	9714	9691	9691	she	376	“ I ’ll text you a location . I think we ’ll be at the hotel . ”
9715	9724	9725	9725	he	506	“ Right . I ’ll be on time , ”
9728	9731	9691	9691	she	376	“ Thanks . ”
9732	9736	9738	9738	he	506	“ Be well ! ”
10889	10900	10901	10901	she	376	“ I should n’t have to prove it , Vince , ”
10906	10930	10931	10931	He	351	“ If you think I ’m a cheat , then leave me already ! Walk out the fucking door ! Just stop this ! ”
11078	11085	11086	11086	he	351	“ I ’m sorry , baby , ”
11089	11097	11098	11098	She	376	“ Terrible accident . Never happen again . ”
11185	11194	11195	11195	she	376	“ He did this , did n’t he ? ”
11209	11226	11227	11227	Ari	376	“ I never liked the look of him . Good for you showing him the door . ”
11339	11348	11349	11349	Maddy	124	“ You ’d do the same for me , ”
11394	11409	11364	11364	Ari	376	“ I can take care of myself , hon . You do the same . ”
11446	11458	11459	11459	Maddy	124	“ Fucking cunt ! Get down here and let me in . ”
11472	11498	11459	11459	Maddy	124	“ Go away or I ’m calling the police . You have ten seconds . Tomorrow Ari will tell you how to get your stuff . ”
11499	11503	11504	11504	he	351	“ Meddling bitch ! ”
12639	12645	12646	12646	Becca	372	“ How ’s O’Doul today ? ”
12660	12674	12646	12646	Becca	372	“ I heard rumors that they sent him to you for his hip . ”
12675	12680	12681	12681	Ari	376	“ He seemed fair , ”
12688	12717	12681	12681	Ari	376	“ A little rest would probably help him . But I do n’t think it ’s any worse than a lot of the strains the guys play on . ”
12785	12841	12772	12772	you	588	“ Is Doulie a diva in the treatment room ? He ’s so freaking bossy . The travel team actually calls all the hotels where he stays and gets duplicate receipts to submit for him , because they ’ve learned it ’s a bigger pain to ask for his cooperation than to just take over . ”
12842	12845	12846	12846	Ari	376	“ Really ? ”
12849	12857	12858	12858	Everyone	364	“ Sounds like he has them trained . ”
12894	12924	12879	12879	Ari	376	“ He has an ego the size of the stadium . If you have any trouble with him , I ’m happy to play the part of bad cop . ”
12925	12932	12933	12933	Ari	376	“ You do that part well . ”
12940	12943	12944	12944	Becca	372	“ Fuck , ”
12947	12964	12965	12965	Ari	376	“ Do that again . Please ? I spent too many hours at my desk today . ”
12990	12999	13000	13000	she	376	“ You only like me for my hands , ”
13003	13024	13000	13000	she	376	“ Not true ! You make a mean margarita , and you always turn in your personnel forms on time . ”
13025	13033	13034	13034	She	376	“ I feel so much better now . ”
13195	13199	13200	13200	Becca	372	“ Marry me , ”
13208	13227	13228	13228	Becca	372	“ I would , but I ’ve sworn off relationships . Today was a good reminder of why . ”
13237	13253	13228	13228	Becca	372	“ Oh , no ! What happened ? Did he pound on your door again ? ”
13254	13272	13228	13228	Becca	372	“ No , but his stuff is still in my basement storage room , and . . . ”
13330	13333	13329	13329	his	72	“ athletic shoes ”
13383	13388	13389	13389	Nate	72	“ Evening , ladies , ”
13551	13566	13538	13538	Becca	372	“ Hi , Lauren ! Want to have a glass of wine with us ? ”
13643	13649	13650	13650	Becca	372	“ I ’m always nice , ”
13656	13665	13650	13650	Becca	372	“ but I ’m really not sure why . ”
13666	13675	13676	13676	Ari	376	“ Because it feels better to be nice , ”
13679	13687	13688	13688	Becca	372	“ And you ’re a beautiful person . ”
13695	13703	13688	13688	Becca	372	“ She makes ugly look pretty good . ”
13762	13765	13766	13766	Nate	72	“ Rebecca , ”
13769	13780	13766	13766	Nate	72	“ Do you happen to have tonight ’s ticket sales ? ”
13781	13786	13787	13787	she	128	“ But of course ! ”
13790	13811	13812	13812	She	128	“ Do you really think I ’d stand here and slurp wine if I had n’t brought them with me ? ”
13828	13836	13812	13812	She	128	“ It ’s here somewhere . Ah . ”
13856	13869	13848	13848	Nate	72	“ Anything shocking in here ? Should I hit the whiskey early ? ”
13870	13888	13889	13889	Nate	72	“ It ’s always cocktail hour somewhere , boss . But the numbers looked good to me . ”
13908	13922	13900	13900	Lauren	128	“ These are good numbers . And I like the time series graph . ”
13923	13940	13942	13942	he	72	“ Thanks ! I got sick of flipping backward to see the prior weeks ’ numbers . ”
13972	13976	13977	13977	Nate	72	“ Thank you , ”
13985	13995	13977	13977	Nate	72	“ That ’s all for today , I suppose . ”
14010	14019	14020	14020	Becca	372	“ Are n’t you staying for the game ? ”
14023	14028	14029	14029	Lauren	128	“ I hate hockey , ”
14118	14126	14127	14127	Nathan	72	“ How ’d the press take it ? ”
14135	14140	14141	14141	Georgia	1098	“ Lots of questions , ”
14144	14152	14141	14141	Georgia	1098	“ There ’s going to be speculation . ”
14153	14157	14158	14158	Becca	372	“ Take what ? ”
14172	14181	14182	14182	Tom	72	“ O’Doul was scratched at the last minute , ”
14185	14203	14206	14206	boy	617	“ The trainers want him rested . That ’s our story and we ’re sticking to it . ”
14354	14361	14342	14342	They	618	“ We need to rest you , ”
14367	14386	14362	14363	Coach Worthington	365	“ I need you to play a long postseason . Ca n’t do that if you ’re injured . ”
14474	14484	14485	14485	Coach	365	“ We got an overtime point out of it , ”
14630	14636	14637	14637	he	609	“ Whoa ! Sorry ma’am , ”
14661	14667	14643	14643	She	633	“ Twenty bucks , man , ”
14671	14675	14643	14643	She	633	“ Pay up . ”
14676	14681	14682	14683	the goalie	630	“ What ? Why ? ”
14686	14696	14682	14683	the goalie	630	“ For almost mowing down that kid . Jimbo ? ”
14711	14717	14682	14683	the goalie	630	“ Sully owes you twenty . ”
14718	14722	14723	14723	Jimbo	136	“ Got it , ”
14742	14746	14735	14736	The team	319	“ parking tickets , ”
14808	14817	14797	14797	they	319	“ Want to get some barbecue for lunch ? ”
14822	14835	14818	14818	Trevi	372	“ The Katt Phone says there ’s a good ribs joint nearby . ”
14836	14841	14842	14842	Castro	72	“ I ’m in , ”
14845	14849	14842	14842	Castro	72	“ I wish , ”
14853	14862	14863	14863	Castro	72	“ I have to get a fucking massage . ”
14870	14879	14880	14880	Castro	72	“ And the problem is . . . ? ”
14883	14886	14880	14880	Castro	72	“ Eh , ”
14899	14909	14887	14887	O’Doul	609	“ Not my favorite way to spend an hour . ”
14910	14916	14917	14917	Trevi	372	“ I ’ll take it ! ”
14920	14940	14941	14941	He	72	“ I like it when Ari does that thing to the base of my skull . With her thumbs ? ”
14954	14960	14961	14961	Castro	72	“ Aw , hell yes , ”
14964	14989	14961	14961	Castro	72	“ And when she does my feet , I always propose . How many marriage proposals do you think she gets in a week ? ”
14990	14995	14996	14996	Trevi	372	“ Let ’s see , ”
15007	15028	14996	14996	Trevi	372	“ She works six days a week during the high season , six massages a day . So probably thirty . ”
15029	15040	15041	15041	Castro	72	“ Six times six is thirty - six , moron , ”
15049	15053	15054	15054	He	72	“ No kidding ? ”
15061	15083	15054	15054	He	72	“ I passed the third grade , too . But not everyone proposes . I would n’t do that to Georgia . ”
15084	15089	15090	15090	Castro	72	“ I propose twice , ”
15093	15099	15090	15090	Castro	72	“ Once for each foot . ”
15100	15109	15110	15110	O’Doul	609	“ Oh , shut it , will you ? ”
15122	15130	15131	15131	Trevi	372	“ Come back in a better mood ! ”
15293	15302	15303	15303	Ari	376	“ That ’s why I called a locksmith , ”
15309	15329	15330	15330	She	645	“ It ’s not that complicated . Remove the lock that ’s there , and install a different one . ”
15333	15371	15330	15330	She	645	“ Well , the deed is n’t in my name . But last time I used your services I did n’t need it . Could I please speak to the manager ? Yes , I ’ll hold . ”
15378	15392	15372	15372	She	645	“ You can change in the bathroom if that makes you more comfortable . ”
15414	15454	15455	15455	She	645	“ Please look up my account . I ’ve used you for years . The lock on the basement door is . . . What ? You installed it ? Seriously ? No , I did n’t authorize it ! ”
15460	15471	15455	15455	She	645	“ He lied , okay ? Men do that sometimes . ”
15520	15548	15552	15552	she	645	“ Just remove the lock and give me another one . I did n’t authorize it . And he is no longer a resident at that address . ”
15588	15592	15593	15593	he	645	“ Everything okay ? ”
15607	15612	15602	15602	She	645	“ Fine . Thanks . ”
15690	15693	15671	15671	He	645	“ Shit . ”
15752	15755	15756	15756	she	645	“ Sorry , ”
15759	15774	15775	15775	He	645	“ But that was excellent comedy , and I needed a laugh right now . ”
15780	15793	15775	15775	He	645	“ Thank you very much , I ’ll be here all week . ”
15818	15830	15806	15806	She	645	“ Just let me put a sheet down on the table . ”
15897	15901	15887	15887	She	645	“ Thank you . ”
15902	15906	15908	15908	she	645	“ No problem . ”
15952	15959	15960	15960	she	645	“ Want to pick a playlist ? ”
15970	15978	15960	15960	she	645	“ I liked what you played before . ”
16005	16026	15992	15992	he	645	“ I ’m sorry you were scratched from last night ’s game . Was n’t my idea , I promise . ”
16027	16030	15992	15992	he	645	“ Okay . ”
16042	16046	16047	16047	She	645	“ It happens . ”
16055	16062	16047	16047	She	645	“ You say that so convincingly . ”
16063	16068	16069	16069	He	645	“ Do n’t I ? ”
16080	16127	16075	16075	Ari	376	“ I ’m going to try to warm you up for a few minutes . After that we ’ll go back to the same active release technique as last time , because I think it was starting to work for you . How does that sound ? ”
16128	16131	16132	16132	he	645	“ Fine , ”
16401	16409	16410	16410	she	645	“ You ’re fighting me , Patrick , ”
16426	16429	16410	16410	she	645	“ Sorry . ”
16460	16474	16453	16453	He	645	“ I know this is n’t your favorite thing . I get it . ”
16495	16505	16453	16453	He	645	“ You must think I ’m a total nutbar . ”
16506	16511	16512	16512	she	645	“ Not at all , ”
16516	16545	16512	16512	she	645	“ I could give you a sermon about how I ’m a professional and this is just business , yada yada yada . But that would be bullshit . ”
16546	16550	16551	16551	He	645	“ It would ? ”
16567	16574	16575	16575	She	645	“ You ’re not a professional ? ”
16580	16635	16575	16575	She	645	“ Of course I am . But when you walk into this room , you do n’t just bring your muscles and your bones . You bring your whole history as a human being . You bring your soul . And when someone touches you , they ’re touching all of that , too . ”
16636	16641	16642	16642	He	659	“ Okay . . . ”
16651	16663	16642	16642	He	659	“ Did you ever stop and wonder why we shake hands ? ”
16676	16689	16664	16664	She	645	“ It ’s a cultural thing . But do you know why ? ”
16690	16704	16705	16705	he	659	“ Ca n’t say I did very well in social studies in school , ”
16719	16790	16791	16791	He	659	“ I have n’t the faintest idea where the tradition came from . But I have a theory . We touch someone we meet because it establishes trust . Maybe it ’s only a tiny little bit of trust . But if I shake your hand , I have to get close to your body . There ’s a brief exchange of heat and sensation . Give me your hand . ”
16825	16858	16859	16859	She	645	“ See — this is just a small extension of trust . But when you ’re on my table , the trust you extend to me is a lot greater than that . ”
16911	16980	16902	16902	she	645	“ Patrick , people have all kinds of reactions to massage . I think you ’d be surprised . Some guys get chatty and tell me a hell of a lot more than they would if my hands were n’t all over their naked bodies . Some guys fall asleep right away . This is all completely normal . Some people even start crying when I touch them . ”
16987	16996	16997	16997	Ari	376	“ Seriously ? Do I know these people ? ”
17003	17031	16997	16997	Ari	376	“ I would n’t tell you that . Never . Just like I would n’t tell another soul what reaction you have to being on my table . ”
17032	17035	17037	17037	he	609	“ Sorry . ”
17042	17046	17047	17047	She	645	“ I know . ”
17052	17098	17047	17047	She	645	“ I ’m not giving up on you . But any ideas you have for making this easier on you , I ’m all ears . I do n’t know if you ’re a fan of meditation , but that ’s something we could try . ”
17099	17102	17103	17103	She	645	“ Eh . ”
17106	17127	17128	17128	She	645	“ Fine . Lie back now . And tell me this — where and when do you feel most relaxed ? ”
17171	17183	17161	17161	He	609	“ At home . In my bed . Just like anyone . ”
17250	17255	17241	17242	the salesperson	668	“ perfect for entertaining . ”
17331	17346	17355	17355	She	376	“ When I need a really relaxing thought , I think about the beach . ”
17347	17351	17352	17352	he	609	“ Which beach ? ”
17384	17388	17389	17389	She	376	“ Any beach . ”
17392	17467	17468	17468	He	609	“ But , okay , not Coney Island , because it ’s crowded . When I was a little girl my grandmother had a place on Fire Island , and I used to stay the whole summer there with her because school was out and Mom was at work . I like the way things sound at the beach . Like they ’re farther away . And the surf has a nice even rhythm . ”
17476	17488	17468	17468	He	609	“ Yeah , I never spent much time on a beach . ”
17489	17499	17468	17468	He	609	“ What do you do during the off season ? ”
17512	17521	17468	17468	He	609	“ Last year I went golfing with Beringer . ”
17522	17527	17468	17468	He	609	“ You like golf ? ”
17528	17531	17532	17532	he	609	“ No , ”
17539	17561	17532	17532	he	609	“ But it was on my bucket list , I guess . To see why all the rich guys liked it . ”
17562	17570	17571	17571	she	674	“ Are n’t you a rich guy ? ”
17574	17599	17600	17600	He	609	“ On paper . But where I grew up , nobody golfed . There was hockey and football . Even baseball was for pussies . ”
17629	17640	17624	17624	She	676	“ Where ’d you grow up ? Wait — Minnesota ? ”
17641	17652	17661	17661	him	609	“ That ’s right . But not the nice part . ”
17664	17669	17661	17661	him	609	“ How about you ? ”
17670	17712	17713	17713	She	676	“ Brooklyn . I grew up on Court Street , about two miles away from where I live now . I ’m an Italian girl who teaches yoga in Brooklyn . I ’ve got all the clichés working together at once . ”
17718	17742	17713	17713	She	676	“ Roll on your side for me . Let ’s do this thing . Can you handle it ? How ’s your pain ? ”
17743	17751	17752	17752	He	609	“ I ’m looser today than yesterday . ”
17755	17767	17752	17752	He	609	“ Maybe that night off was n’t such a bad plan ? ”
17768	17780	17781	17781	She	676	“ What — you sure you do n’t want the credit ? ”
17792	17827	17828	17828	She	676	“ I never take credit . My job is to help you get out of your own way and then hog the limelight . Bend your knee . Are you working this muscle today ? ”
17835	17844	17828	17828	She	676	“ Or am I allowed to do it ? ”
17845	17861	17869	17869	she	676	“ I would n’t want to put you out of a job . Go ahead . ”
17897	17939	17940	17940	She	676	“ Put your palm down on the table . I want you as stable as possible . Remember — don’t use your back . We want a gentle extension , so if anything hurts , do n’t push it . Ready ? ”
17952	17955	17956	17956	He	609	“ Extend . ”
18009	18012	18013	18013	she	676	“ Good ! ”
18020	18056	18013	18013	she	676	“ Let ’s leave it there for now . Roll onto your stomach if you would n’t mind . I ’m going to work on your lower back and ask you a few more questions . ”
18084	18097	18098	18098	she	676	“ Your goal is to avoid overcompensating with your back and quads , ”
18108	18129	18098	18098	she	676	“ The nerves attached to your hip flexors stretch down your leg and around to your lumbar spine . Here . ”
18150	18163	18146	18146	his	609	“ So when you skate the warm - up tomorrow . . . ”
18164	18177	18178	18178	She	676	“ . . . If I skate the warm - up tomorrow . ”
18183	18231	18178	18178	She	676	“ Let ’s be optimistic , big guy . When you skate the warm - up , I want you to think about keeping the form of your stride all night long . When you ’re tired , do n’t change your stance to activate your back . ”
18232	18238	18239	18239	He	609	“ I can do that . ”
18257	18291	18292	18292	Ari	376	“ The fight is the hairy part . But if I can knock that out in the first period , it ’s easier to keep things stable for the rest of the game . ”
18305	18322	18323	18323	He	609	“ Can I ask you something ? And I do n’t mean this to sound judgmental . ”
18326	18339	18340	18340	She	376	“ That ’s what people say right before they say something judgmental . ”
18353	18390	18344	18344	he	609	“ That is sometimes true . But I never saw a hockey game until I applied for this job . And I want you to explain the fighting to me . Why do you do it ? ”
18413	18447	18403	18403	He	609	“ There ’s a code . Most of the time when I fight , it ’s because someone broke that code or someone needs a refresher . I fight to protect my guys . ”
18474	18477	18478	18478	she	376	“ Okay , ”
18482	18489	18478	18478	she	376	“ But then who protects you ? ”
18514	18523	18505	18505	her	376	“ I guess I do . I dunno . ”
18742	18754	18755	18755	she	376	“ If you turn over I can work on your quads , ”
18782	18788	18789	18789	he	609	“ I have to run , ”
18792	18807	18789	18789	he	609	“ I appreciate it , but there are some calls I need to return . ”
18821	18833	18789	18789	he	609	“ And here I thought we were getting along so well . ”
18834	18838	18789	18789	he	609	“ We are . ”
18842	18853	18789	18789	he	609	“ Really . I ’ll show up tomorrow and everything . ”
18854	18858	18859	18859	He	609	“ Good man . ”
18870	18897	18859	18859	He	609	“ Let me wash my hands and then the bathroom and shower are all yours . You do n’t want massage oil all over your clothes . ”
18933	18939	18940	18940	she	376	“ Take care of yourself , ”
19209	19214	19215	19216	the fan	686	“ Aw , hell , ”
19224	19241	19215	19216	the fan	686	“ Crazy rookie was looking for a fight right there . That ’s what that was . ”

19569	19574	19575	19575	Ari	376	“ Is he okay ? ”
19593	19614	19585	19586	The trainer	456	“ Sure . He just gets like this some nights . Kinda withdrawn . He likes to be left alone . ”
19640	19645	19624	19624	She	456	“ How are you ? ”
19653	19656	19646	19646	He	456	“ Fine . ”
19663	19667	19668	19668	He	456	“ What hurts ? ”
19694	19699	19700	19700	He	456	“ Are you injured ? ”
19705	19716	19717	19717	She	376	“ No . But I broke that kid ’s jaw . ”
19722	19730	19717	19717	She	376	“ Really ? How do you know ? ”
19731	19736	19737	19737	His	456	“ Felt the pop . ”
19742	19746	19747	19747	she	376	“ Come here , ”

19866	19873	19874	19874	she	376	“ Tell me about the fight , ”
19882	19887	19888	19888	he	456	“ It was stupid , ”
19891	19938	19888	19888	he	456	“ I told the kid he ’d been a dick , and that his enforcer had better come out and answer for that bullshit on Castro . But he says , I ’ll fight you myself . I told him that sounded like a stupid idea . ”
19939	19947	19948	19948	She	376	“ And . . . it was ? ”
19962	19973	19974	19974	He	456	“ I spent hours watching their enforcer ’s fight tapes . ”
19979	19985	19974	19974	He	456	“ We all do that . ”

20258	20263	20264	20264	he	609	“ Not as bad , ”
20268	20279	20280	20280	She	376	“ Well . There ’s a shred of good news . ”

23929	23950	23951	23951	She	376	“ That might account for their allergic reaction to the cops cruising by . Did you happen to call 911 ? ”
23957	23981	23951	23951	She	376	“ I tried . But my phone would n’t log on . I almost threw it across the room I was so frustrated . ”

24156	24160	24161	24161	She	376	“ No landline ? ”
24169	24225	24161	24161	She	376	“ Nope . My phone would n’t work , and I could n’t think what to do . He started shouting , and I was upstairs trying to e - mail my neighbor from the laptop . Then he put the brick through the window right next to me . Scared me half to death . ”
24256	24287	24161	24161	She	376	“ I think you need to do some of that yoga breathing you ’re always forcing on us . In for a count of eight , and out for four . ”
24288	24302	24308	24308	She	376	“ If you ’re trying to calm down , it ’s the reverse . ”
24303	24307	24308	24308	She	376	“ My bad . ”
24318	24361	24308	24308	She	376	“ God , I ’m so pissed off right now ! My window is broken . And that asshole made me feel unsafe in my own house . And I ca n’t even fix it because we ’re off to Montreal tomorrow . ”
24362	24381	24382	24382	he	326	“ One thing at a time , okay ? There ’s no reason to be afraid right now , ”
24399	24429	24390	24390	She	376	“ He ’ll be back . I had the locks changed on the storage room , because I think he was using it for some kind of dodgy business . ”
24451	24460	24461	24461	She	376	“ Do you want to call the cops ? ”
24464	24475	24461	24461	She	376	“ Maybe ? Do I have to decide right now ? ”
24476	24493	24430	24430	O’Doul	609	“ No . But why would n’t you ? Are you keeping him out of trouble ? ”
24494	24563	24564	24564	She	376	“ He can hang for all I care . But if the cops arrest him , he ’d get out on bail , pissed as hell at me . I ’d rather find a way to just be rid of him . I should n’t have locked him out . That was stupid of me . But I needed a way to motivate him to leave for good ! ”
24580	24584	24585	24585	He	794	“ All right . ”
24593	24610	24585	24585	He	794	“ Let me take a look at your broken window . Can you call the super ? ”
24611	24617	24577	24577	his	794	“ I am the super . ”
24618	24621	24622	24622	He	794	“ Ah . ”
24625	24635	24622	24622	He	794	“ We need a piece of plywood , then . ”
24646	24668	24640	24640	she	376	“ I have one already , because the kids in the neighborhood have broken windows before . With baseballs , though . ”
24690	24697	24698	24698	he	794	“ You ’re not wearing shoes , ”
24702	24708	24709	24709	She	376	“ Let me do this . ”
24719	24731	24709	24709	She	376	“ I ’ll get the broom and some damp paper towels . ”
24779	24794	24773	24773	she	376	“ God , if I replace it , will he just break it again ? ”
24795	24814	24815	24815	he	794	“ It ’s too late to worry about it tonight , anyway . Are you packed for Montreal ? ”
24824	24827	24828	24828	He	794	“ Yes . ”
24833	24859	24828	24828	He	794	“ Let ’s go . You ca n’t stay here tonight . And in twelve hours you ’ll be on the way to the airport . ”
24860	24866	24773	24773	she	376	“ Where are we going ? ”
24870	24893	24773	24773	she	376	“ Anywhere you want . But unless you have a better idea , my place . I ’m just on Water Street . ”
24920	24923	24924	24924	she	376	“ Okay , ”
24927	24940	24941	24941	She	376	“ I . . . God , I ’m such an idiot . ”
24964	24969	24970	24970	he	794	“ Come on now , ”
24974	24983	24970	24970	he	794	“ It ’s going to be all right . ”
25122	25128	25110	25110	he	351	“ Who lives up there ? ”
25138	25149	25150	25150	she	376	“ Maddy , my tenant . That ’s her entrance , ”
25159	25193	25150	25150	she	376	“ I ’ll e - mail her tonight and give her a heads up . She already knows that Vince is a loose cannon , though . She wo n’t even be surprised . ”
25252	25258	25259	25259	O’Doul	609	“ Vince is your ex ? ”
25263	25269	25259	25259	O’Doul	609	“ Yeah . Long story . ”
25270	25276	25259	25259	O’Doul	609	“ I ’ve got time . ”
25279	25318	25259	25259	O’Doul	609	“ I threw him out six weeks ago . But we were together for eight years , since I was twenty - one , and a waitress at his club in Manhattan . I was young and stupid . ”
25319	25325	25326	25326	She	376	“ Were n’t we all . ”
25333	25385	25326	25326	She	376	“ In my defense , he used to treat me really well . He was an older , successful man — he ’s thirty - nine now . I was attracted to his confidence . He treated me like a queen for years — until things stopped going well for him . ”
25386	25390	25259	25259	O’Doul	609	“ And then ? ”
25399	25536	25259	25259	O’Doul	609	“ He became overextended . When I met him he owned a club and had an interest in another . But over the years he tried to expand his empire , and it was harder than he thought it would be . I think he got into business with some people he should n’t have trusted . I ’m pretty sure they screwed him over . Every year it got a little worse . One of the clubs recently had a bunch of drug busts , and they lost their liquor license . And I think Vince owes a bunch of people money . But to listen to him , it ’s always someone else ’s fault . This past year I tried to ask more questions , and he did n’t like that at all . ”
25562	25576	25553	25555	A uniformed doorman	809	“ Evening , Mr. O’Doul . Will you need a car tomorrow morning ? ”
25577	25593	25549	25549	O’Doul	609	“ Yeah , thanks . Flight leaves at eight . So . . . seven ? ”
25594	25602	25603	25604	The doorman	809	“ I ’ll take care of it . ”
25766	25781	25782	25782	he	609	“ I do n’t usually have people over . So it ’s . . . ”
25785	25791	25792	25792	she	823	“ A messy bachelor pad ? ”
25795	25799	25792	25792	she	823	“ Not exactly . ”
25848	25855	25856	25856	he	609	“ It ’s all one room , ”
25859	25867	25856	25856	he	609	“ But you can have the bed . ”
25868	25877	25878	25878	His	609	“ You do n’t have to do that . ”
25896	25914	25915	25915	she	823	“ Your couch could seat a family of six . I ’m just happy to . . . ”
25923	25943	25915	25915	she	823	“ Thank you . For chasing him off . This has been the most embarrassing night of my life . ”
25944	25947	25948	25948	He	609	“ Why ? ”
25966	25980	25962	25962	she	823	“ You did n’t throw a brick through your own window , right ? ”
25981	25992	25993	25993	She	823	“ I just never thought I ’d be that girl . ”
26017	26026	26005	26005	she	823	“ The one who needs a restraining order . ”
26027	26036	26037	26037	he	609	“ We need a drink , I think , ”
26044	26078	26079	26079	He	609	“ I do n’t entertain . So there ’s either Diet Coke or hard liquor . Scotch is my drink of choice . I ’ll bring you both , and you can decide . ”
26085	26099	26079	26079	He	609	“ I do n’t drink diet sodas . That shit can kill you . ”
26103	26117	26118	26118	He	609	“ If you feel the same about Scotch , do n’t tell me . ”
26157	26164	26143	26143	He	609	“ You ’re in , right ? ”
26165	26169	26170	26170	He	609	“ Hell yes . ”
26189	26200	26179	26179	she	831	“ God , I love that smell . So good . ”
26208	26220	26179	26179	she	831	“ I would n’t have picked you for a Scotch drinker . ”
26221	26236	26237	26237	He	609	“ Why ? You think yoga teachers sit around drinking shots of kale juice ? ”
26240	26254	26237	26237	He	609	“ No . Okay , maybe . But you drink wine with Georgia . ”
26255	26293	26311	26311	O’Doul	609	“ I drink wine with Georgia because Georgia likes the company . And because it ’s a habit . My ex did n’t think a lady should drink Scotch . He never offered me any of his . ”
26325	26343	26344	26344	She	831	“ To your health , and to your ex taking a long walk off a short pier . ”
26374	26384	26385	26385	Ugh	157	“ So what made you finally kick him out ? ”
26399	26491	26385	26385	Ugh	157	“ He stopped being nice to me . But I hung on a long time hoping things would get better . He ’d supported me when I wanted to go to school for massage therapy . So I told myself that I should be there for him even during the rough times , you know ? I wanted to be loyal . It was my idea to let go of his high - rent place in the city and move into my uncle ’s house when Uncle Alberto moved to Florida . ”
26492	26499	26550	26550	Scotch	156	“ Nice house by the way . ”
26500	26546	26550	26550	Scotch	156	“ Thanks . I pay ridiculously low rent in exchange for keeping the place up . But after we moved there , Vince just got mean . At first it was just petty criticism . He started insulting me in front of people we knew . ”
26574	26633	26560	26560	O’Doul	609	“ Then I got the job for the team , and he seemed happy for me . At first . But I was gone a lot . He hated that . He started questioning my whereabouts and acting like a jealous freak . I thought maybe things would turn around for him and he ’d just ease up . ”
26676	26679	26680	26680	O’Doul	609	“ Hey , ”
26683	26692	26680	26680	O’Doul	609	“ You do n’t have to tell me . ”
26693	26699	26700	26700	she	832	“ It ’s . . . ”
26717	26734	26737	26737	his	609	“ He got a little physical one night , and I left him the next day . ”
26740	26749	26750	26750	She	832	“ Is that what happened to your foot ? ”
26753	26800	26801	26801	She	832	“ But please do n’t say anything . I did n’t tell anyone the truth about that , except for Becca . I ’d go over to Becca ’s tonight , but she and Georgia went wedding dress shopping and then out to dinner . Shit . ”
26812	26820	26801	26801	She	832	“ You probably had plans , too . ”
26846	26862	26863	26863	Ari	376	“ I ’m pretty sure the team can get drunk without my help for once . ”
26891	26897	26876	26876	O’Doul	609	“ Did you eat dinner ? ”
26898	26914	26915	26915	He	834	“ Yes . I was just throwing away my takeout box when the shouting started . ”
26918	26945	26915	26915	He	834	“ Good . I could probably dig up some crackers , but that ’s about it . My fridge is nothing but ketchup and old leftovers . ”
26946	26984	26876	26876	O’Doul	609	“ Well , you ’re on the road half the time . And in New York , nobody needs to cook anyway . I wonder what players do in the flyover states . Starve , I guess . ”
26985	26996	26997	26997	He	834	“ I wish . They ’d be easier to beat . ”
27007	27034	27003	27003	she	832	“ If you think you ’re going to crash , help yourself to anything in the bathroom . I ’ll make up the bed for you . ”
27035	27046	26876	26876	O’Doul	609	“ I really do n’t want to put you out . ”
27056	27059	27060	27060	he	834	“ Naw , ”
27066	27091	27060	27060	he	834	“ Been a while since I ’ve been to a pajama party . We can braid each other ’s hair and tell ghost stories . ”
27246	27254	27255	27255	she	832	“ Did you furnish this place yourself ? ”
27281	27329	27271	27271	He	609	“ Not hardly . I bought the apartment from a married couple — David and Dexter — who were moving into an antique house in San Francisco . They had bought all this Scandinavian stuff and were fretting about how it would n’t match the new place . ”
27338	27367	27330	27330	He	609	“ So I bought , like , all their stuff . Even the dishes . Did n’t have to set foot in a store . Best deal ever . ”
27368	27383	27276	27276	her	832	“ That was very pragmatic of you . David and Dexter have lovely taste . ”
27384	27408	27330	27330	He	609	“ I know , right ? But I probably would have bought it even if everything was mint green . I hate shopping . ”
27409	27423	27424	27424	He	609	“ And you do n’t entertain very much ? Your place is nice . ”
27432	27452	27424	27424	He	609	“ It took me a long time to get my own place . I ’m not used to sharing . ”
27466	27483	27484	27484	O’Doul	609	“ What do you mean it took you a long time to get your own place ? ”
27491	27502	27484	27484	O’Doul	609	“ Did n’t get any help , that ’s all . ”
27503	27508	27509	27509	she	838	“ From your parents ? ”
27512	27520	27521	27521	He	609	“ Do n’t have any of those . ”
27628	27635	27617	27617	he	609	“ Is this Face / Off ? ”
27636	27639	27640	27640	He	609	“ Yeah . ”
27684	27691	27674	27674	He	609	“ Do you like this movie ? ”
27692	27712	27713	27713	He	609	“ Of course . Nicolas Cage has the coolest money clip . A golden dragon head . Totally badass . ”
28216	28222	28223	28223	he	609	“ Come on , sweetheart , ”
28232	28239	28223	28223	he	609	“ Time to hit the hay . ”
28283	28288	28289	28289	he	609	“ There you go , ”
28415	28422	28402	28402	He	609	“ What ’s that , sweetheart ? ”
28450	28464	28434	28434	He	609	“ You ’re going to be fine , you know that , right ? ”
29038	29041	29042	29042	she	765	“ Hi , ”
29046	29055	29042	29042	she	765	“ Hi yourself . You a coffee drinker ? ”
29063	29069	29070	29070	she	765	“ The stronger the better , ”
29073	29101	29070	29070	she	765	“ I knew I liked you . I ’ll make some . We have about thirty minutes until the car comes . The shower is all yours . ”
29102	29106	29107	29107	she	765	“ Thank you , ”
29292	29300	29301	29301	she	765	“ You have the most amazing shower , ”
29308	29318	29319	29319	he	485	“ It ’s my favorite thing about this apartment , ”
29322	29348	29301	29301	she	765	“ I do n’t know why the builder decided to put in three separate sprays , but I like it . Milk for your coffee ? ”
29349	29355	29356	29356	He	485	“ If you have it . ”
29367	29370	29371	29371	He	485	“ Always . ”
29399	29405	29379	29379	She	765	“ Patrick , thank you . ”
29406	29411	29412	29412	he	485	“ It ’s nothing , ”
29421	29425	29426	29426	she	765	“ Not true , ”
29437	29474	29426	29426	she	765	“ Yesterday was a total shit show . I know it was just a coincidence that you were the one to witness it . But I really appreciate all the help . You have no idea . ”
29475	29478	29479	29479	He	485	“ Well . ”
29484	29499	29479	29479	He	485	“ Do n’t mention it . Just glad I got there when I did . ”
29514	29527	29509	29509	he	485	“ Our car is downstairs . You need anything before we go ? ”
29536	29548	29528	29528	He	485	“ I ’ll just need another minute to grab my things . ”
29728	29735	29736	29736	Georgia	1098	“ I ’m not buying it , ”
29776	29786	29787	29787	Ari	376	“ Suit yourself , but it did n’t happen , ”
29797	29813	29787	29787	Ari	376	“ These are really good , by the way . I love spicy peanut oil . ”
29814	29821	29822	29822	Georgia	1098	“ You ’re changing the subject , ”
29825	29831	29832	29832	She	376	“ If you say so . ”
29844	29855	29856	29856	Ari	376	“ Wait . Really ? You did n’t hook up ? ”
29861	29881	29856	29856	Ari	376	“ I was having a rough day . My , uh , ex was giving me a hard time . ”
29882	29887	29888	29888	Georgia	1098	“ Oh , no ! ”
29895	29901	29888	29888	Georgia	1098	“ What did he do ? ”
29902	29914	29922	29922	She	376	“ He was just being a dick . Yelling at me . ”
29947	29990	29940	29940	she	376	“ You and Becca were dress shopping , and O’Doul was in the neighborhood . So I went home with him . No sex happened . But I got drunk and passed out on his couch in front of Face / Off . ”
29991	29994	29995	29995	Georgia	1098	“ Bummer . ”
30000	30017	29995	29995	Georgia	1098	“ I like my version of events better . More hot sex . Fewer terrible exes . ”
30018	30031	29940	29940	she	376	“ I know , right ? But it ’s not like that . ”
30032	30039	30040	30040	Georgia	1098	“ Could it be , though ? ”
30047	30105	30040	30040	Georgia	1098	“ I was kidding a second ago , but I ’m serious now . I used to think O’Doul was an ass . But now I think he ’s just really lonely . My gut says that if the right girl softened him up a little , he ’d be the most loyal man who ever lived . ”
30125	30154	30164	30164	she	376	“ Someone else will have to win that prize . I have n’t been single since I was twenty - one . I need a break from men . ”
30196	30204	30173	30173	she	376	“ Was he awful ? Your ex ? ”
30207	30253	30173	30173	she	376	“ I do n’t even know how to answer that . I put up with too much from him . I was like a frog sitting in the water on the stovetop . The water got hotter and hotter , and I did n’t jump . ”
30254	30261	30262	30262	Georgia	1098	“ But then you finally did , ”
30338	30355	30356	30356	Georgia	1098	“ So , do n’t keep me hanging . Did you find a dress last night ? ”
30359	30383	30356	30356	Georgia	1098	“ I found a dozen of them . Becca made me try on so many they ’ve all blurred together in my mind . ”
30384	30390	30319	30319	she	376	“ Ah . You overshopped . ”
30391	30486	30356	30356	Georgia	1098	“ I did ! Becca has some serious stamina . I swear to god , she has a special notebook just for my wedding , with dividers and sections , and a place to put pictures she ’s clipped . No wonder she ’s such a good office manager . But it ’s killing me . I ca n’t wait to marry Leo . But the ceremony is twenty minutes , right ? Is it awful that I ’m way more interested in making it to the play - offs than in flower arrangements ? ”
30487	30501	30356	30356	Georgia	1098	“ It ’s fine . But you do need to choose a dress . ”
30502	30519	30520	30520	Georgia	1098	“ I think I did . Hang on — you can tell me what you think . ”
30544	30549	30532	30532	She	1098	“ Nice . Wow . ”
30568	30580	30532	30532	She	1098	“ Did you buy it ? That ’s kind of perfect . ”
30581	30642	30643	30643	Ari	376	“ Not yet , but I will . In fact , I ’ll call them today and ask them to put it aside for me . Becca has this idea that we ’re going to look at some other shops . But I do n’t see the point . I ’m going to wear it once . Why shop twice ? ”
30652	30665	30643	30643	Ari	376	“ It really suits you , too . It ’s not fussy . ”
30666	30700	30532	30532	She	1098	“ Thanks . I had no idea just how fussy those suckers could be . I put my foot down when Becca wanted me to try one with beads on it . Beads ! ”
30701	30705	30706	30706	Ari	376	“ The horror , ”
30709	30770	30706	30706	Ari	376	“ I know , right ? I made the mistake of asking Becca if she thought I could get away with a dress that was n’t so weddingy , so I could wear it again . The poor girl almost had a coronary . So I tried on a dress with lace on it just to make her feel better . ”
30771	30780	30781	30781	Ari	376	“ I do n’t see you in lace , ”
30784	30796	30797	30797	She	376	“ Buy the one in the picture . You look amazing . ”
30803	30840	30797	30797	She	376	“ When I was a little girl I did that thing where you put a white T - shirt over your hair and pretend to get married . I could n’t wait to plan my wedding . ”
30841	30846	30847	30847	Georgia	1098	“ Hmm . . . ”
30859	30913	30847	30847	Georgia	1098	“ I did n’t play wedding . But I did practice standing on the podium at Wimbledon , and curtseying for the queen . So I ca n’t claim to be any less vain . And that Wimbledon thing is n’t happening for me , so I might as well throw a wedding . ”
30939	30992	30993	30993	Georgia	1098	“ When I was twenty - two years old , I was sure that Vince and I would get married . And even as things sort of fell apart with him , I still hoped he ’d pull it together so we could plan our future . God , that was stupid . ”
31002	31015	30993	30993	Georgia	1098	“ I ’m sorry . But there are better men out there . ”
31016	31019	31020	31020	She	886	“ Yeah . ”
31025	31061	31062	31062	Georgia	1098	“ Last night I was trying to explain to O’Doul why I stayed with Vince for so long . Everything I said sounded lame . And I did n’t even tell him the worst reason . ”
31067	31072	31062	31062	Georgia	1098	“ What ’s that ? ”
31073	31106	30993	30993	Georgia	1098	“ I want a child . I ’ll be thirty next year , damn it . I was hoping things with Vince would get better so that we could start a family . ”
31107	31114	31115	31115	Georgia	1098	“ But you ’re still young ! ”
31120	31150	31115	31115	Georgia	1098	“ Five years from now you could have a husband and two kids . Lots of people do n’t have kids until their thirties . This is n’t 1950 . ”
31151	31199	30993	30993	Georgia	1098	“ I ’m just so annoyed with myself . When I teach a yoga class , I ’m standing there asking everyone in the room to become mindful of their surroundings . But it turns out I was n’t doing such a great job of that myself . ”
31200	31206	31207	31207	Georgia	1098	“ I do n’t know , ”
31211	31225	31207	31207	Georgia	1098	“ You got the hell away from him the moment it mattered most . ”
31226	31233	31235	31235	them	887	“ That ’s what Patrick said . ”
31278	31283	31284	31284	Georgia	1098	“ So , wait , ”
31290	31304	31284	31284	Georgia	1098	“ Back up a second . You stayed with Doulie in his apartment ? ”
31305	31316	31317	31317	Georgia	1098	“ Sure ? Where else would I stay with him ? ”
31322	31338	31317	31317	Georgia	1098	“ See , this is gossip ! Nobody has ever been to O’Doul ’s apartment . ”
31339	31350	31284	31284	Georgia	1098	“ What do you mean , nobody ? I have . ”
31351	31405	31406	31406	Ari	376	“ I know ! But he ’s never invited his teammates over . Ever . What was it like in there ? Castro has this theory that O’Doul has a sex dungeon that he does n’t want anyone to see . They tease him about it sometimes , but he does n’t react . ”
31415	31458	31406	31406	Ari	376	“ That ’s ridiculous . O’Doul ’s place is lovely . It ’s a loft space , though . All one room . Maybe that ’s why he does n’t like to entertain ? The bed is right there in the room . ”
31470	31496	31459	31459	Georgia	1098	“ Maybe the secret chamber is hidden behind a bookshelf . There could be a special brick — push it and the wall swings open . ”
31497	31503	31504	31504	Ari	376	“ That must be it , ”
31607	31616	31617	31617	Castro	72	“ You ’re marrying me someday , right ? ”
31625	31628	31629	31629	she	1098	“ Mmm ? ”
31638	31644	31645	31646	her client	495	“ Just my usual proposal , ”
31649	31663	31664	31664	She	1098	“ But you seem distracted today . I ’m gon na get offended . ”
31963	31970	31957	31957	Patrick	609	“ Trying to kill us today ? ”
31971	31982	31983	31983	she	376	“ That would n’t be good for my job security , ”
31987	32004	31983	31983	she	376	“ I ’m only trying to make it possible for you to rest before the game . ”
32005	32011	31957	31957	Patrick	609	“ I think it worked . ”
32012	32019	32020	32020	she	376	“ Go right upstairs and nap , ”
32266	32269	32270	32270	Georgia	1098	“ Jesus , ”
32428	32435	32436	32437	the trainer	700	“ Let me see your face , ”
32479	32483	32484	32484	Henry	77	“ That hurts ? ”
32487	32490	32484	32484	Henry	77	“ No . ”
32501	32522	32484	32484	Henry	77	“ Does n’t look too bad . We ’ll need to check for concussion symptoms . How ’s the hip ? ”
32523	32526	32531	32531	He	609	“ Fine . ”
32566	32577	32578	32578	Henry	77	“ Come on . The doc needs to evaluate you . ”
32581	32589	32578	32578	Henry	77	“ I ’m not leaving the game . ”
32602	32625	32590	32590	Henry	77	“ You need to be evaluated . If the doctor is impressed , you ’ll be back when the overtime period starts . ”
32745	32752	32733	32733	His	609	“ Ca n’t win ’em all , ”
32808	32811	32812	32812	he	609	“ Hi , ”
32818	32825	32826	32826	He	609	“ Are you . . . ? ”
32832	32839	32826	32826	He	609	“ I ’m fine . Really . ”
32840	32846	32826	32826	He	609	“ Looked like it hurt . ”
32847	32854	32855	32855	She	376	“ I ’ve had better days . ”
32867	32878	32855	32855	She	376	“ Yeah . Do they have whiskey on the jet ? ”
32879	32882	32883	32883	He	609	“ Why ? ”
32895	32900	32883	32883	He	609	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
32901	32904	32905	32905	She	376	“ Nothing . ”
32919	32922	32923	32923	he	609	“ Sweetheart , ”
32926	32934	32935	32935	Her	376	“ Come on . You look freaked . ”
32942	32950	32935	32935	Her	376	“ I ’m tired of being freaked . ”
32951	32973	32974	32974	She	376	“ Sing it , sister . But we do n’t always get what we want . Just tell me what happened . ”
32980	33026	32974	32974	She	376	“ My tenant had to call the cops earlier . Vince showed up to saw the basement door off its hinges . I thought he might try something . All he had to do to know I was n’t home was read the game schedule . ”
33027	33034	32935	32935	Her	376	“ Shit . I ’m sorry . ”
33035	33098	33099	33099	She	918	“ He was removing stuff from the storage room when the cops showed , but Maddy thinks they did n’t catch him . So now I have a broken window and a broken door . I need to follow up with the police . And my first appointment is supposed to be at nine in the morning and I just . . . ”
33108	33141	33142	33142	He	918	“ Hey , do n’t worry . Henry will understand if you need a couple extra hours tomorrow . There ’s no single - malt on the jet , but . . . ”
33149	33156	33142	33142	He	918	“ Jill , how are you ? ”
33157	33168	33145	33147	the flight attendant	919	“ Excellent , Doulie ! What can I bring you ? ”
33169	33187	33142	33142	He	918	“ Everyone in this row has had a shit day . We need something fun to drink . ”
33188	33193	33194	33196	the young woman	920	“ Like a margarita ? ”
33199	33214	33194	33196	the young woman	920	“ That ’s what I drink when I need more fun in my life . ”
33215	33223	33224	33224	he	918	“ How do you feel about margaritas ? ”
33228	33235	33236	33236	she	920	“ I ’m a lifelong fan , ”
33239	33246	33236	33236	she	920	“ Two of those , please . ”
33254	33258	33259	33259	Ari	376	“ Thank you , ”
33262	33275	33259	33259	Ari	376	“ I say that a lot lately . But I mean it . ”
33276	33280	33281	33281	he	918	“ I know , ”
33285	33300	33281	33281	he	918	“ This too shall pass . And in the meantime , there ’s tequila . ”
33325	33333	33334	33334	she	920	“ Thank you for dropping me off , ”
33386	33397	33370	33370	She	920	“ Do n’t you need him to wait for you ? ”
33398	33419	33370	33370	She	920	“ Nah . It ’s just a couple of blocks . I want to make sure you ’re okay here . ”
33433	33456	33457	33457	He	783	“ Well , thanks . It ’s not like I expect to find him lurking in the shadows , but . . . ”
33503	33516	33517	33517	She	920	“ Do you want to take a look around back , first ? ”
33521	33524	33517	33517	She	920	“ Sure . ”
33586	33590	33591	33591	Ari	376	“ All right , ”
33598	33609	33591	33591	Ari	376	“ I guess I ’m not looking in there tonight . ”
33617	33626	33610	33610	They	929	“ The door can be fixed pretty easily , ”
33631	33635	33636	33636	she	920	“ I know , ”
33714	33718	33719	33719	he	783	“ Look okay ? ”
33722	33737	33719	33719	he	783	“ So far , so good . I do n’t think anyone was here . ”
33738	33746	33747	33747	He	783	“ Let ’s just have a look . ”
33818	33829	33815	33815	nobody	393	“ Is there access from the basement into your apartment ? ”
33830	33840	33841	33841	She	920	“ Yes and no . I ’ll show you . ”
33877	33897	33815	33815	nobody	393	“ This is the basement door . I never open it because there ’s no light over the stairs . ”
33898	33912	33815	33815	nobody	393	“ Okay . And nobody came through here tonight . You ’d know . ”
33913	33945	33946	33946	She	920	“ Right . I ’d have another broken door . So it looks like he did n’t try to get inside the house . Or he did n’t have enough time . ”
33982	33989	33964	33964	He	783	“ You hear anything up there ? ”
34057	34063	34064	34064	she	920	“ Does it look okay ? ”
34072	34077	34078	34078	He	783	“ Sure , sweetheart . ”
34083	34092	34078	34078	He	783	“ Except we missed this chunk of glass . ”
34160	34166	34167	34167	She	920	“ Are you all right ? ”
34747	34753	34754	34754	he	609	“ Tell me to stop , ”
34806	34812	34813	34813	he	609	“ Tell me to stop , ”
34888	34894	34895	34895	he	609	“ So I ’m staying ? ”
35325	35328	35317	35317	He	609	“ Fuck . ”
35378	35382	35383	35383	he	609	“ Lie down , ”
35587	35590	35591	35591	she	376	“ Oh , ”
35847	35850	35851	35851	she	376	“ What ? ”
35858	35869	35855	35855	He	609	“ Just enjoying the view . Is that so wrong ? ”
36103	36117	36088	36088	he	609	“ You ready ? Because you are going to get it so good . ”
36260	36265	36266	36266	he	609	“ So fucking sweet , ”
36566	36569	36570	36570	he	609	“ Fuck , ”
36573	36582	36583	36583	She	376	“ Now I know how people get religion . ”
36590	36596	36583	36583	She	376	“ What religion is this ? ”
36611	36623	36597	36597	He	609	“ Dunno . Ca n’t string a sentence together right now . ”
36701	36708	36709	36709	he	609	“ So this is a problem , ”
36723	36736	36720	36720	her	376	“ Ca n’t we put off the regrets until daylight at least ? ”
36737	36745	36746	36746	he	609	“ What regrets ? I have none , ”
36749	36785	36746	36746	he	609	“ The problem is that I already get boned up on your massage table . Next time you put your hands on me at work I ’m gon na start moaning like a porn star . ”
36786	36797	36798	36798	she	376	“ Might have to get out a gag for you , ”
36808	36822	36801	36801	He	609	“ Doubt it ’ll work . Probably just turn me into a submissive . ”
37096	37101	37102	37102	She	376	“ You can stay . ”
37107	37123	37124	37124	He	609	“ I mean , if you want to . It ’s pretty late . . . ”
37140	37175	37176	37176	He	609	“ Not leaving you here alone , sweetheart . You do n’t know if dumbass is going to try to break in again , and it ’s too late to talk to the cops . ”
37180	37194	37195	37195	He	609	“ So it ’s your place or mine . And yours is closer . ”
37310	37313	37303	37303	he	609	“ Patrick . ”
37314	37317	37303	37303	he	609	“ Mmh . ”
37318	37321	37303	37303	he	609	“ Patrick . ”
37329	37332	37303	37303	he	609	“ Mmh ? ”
37333	37342	37343	37343	His	609	“ There are cops at my front door . ”
37348	37351	37343	37343	His	609	“ Really ? ”
37352	37366	37303	37303	he	609	“ Someone ’s knocking , and there ’s a cruiser out in front . ”
37367	37370	37371	37371	He	609	“ Fuck . ”
37439	37447	37431	37431	He	609	“ Good morning . Welcome to chaos . ”
37448	37451	37436	37436	she	376	“ Right . ”
37452	37465	37466	37466	She	376	“ I ’ll tell them I need a minute to get dressed . ”
37517	37521	37522	37522	he	609	“ Good morning , ”
37541	37562	37567	37567	him	176	“ I ’m Detective Miller of the eighty - fourth precinct . Looking to speak to a Mr. Alberto Bettini . ”
37569	37587	37567	37567	him	176	“ But that ’s not you . Hey — aren’t you Patrick O’Doul ? Am I crazy ? ”
37588	37599	37600	37600	Patrick	609	“ Could n’t say if you ’re crazy , man , ”
37609	37616	37600	37600	Patrick	609	“ I ’m O’Doul , though . ”
37629	37642	37617	37618	The detective	609	“ Nice to meet you . Saw the Rangers game last month . ”
37643	37646	37647	37647	Ari	376	“ Patrick ? ”
37653	37658	37647	37647	Ari	376	“ Is everything okay ? ”
37677	37690	37659	37660	Detective Miller	72	“ I need to speak with the owner . Is Alberto here ? ”
37691	37711	37659	37660	Detective Miller	72	“ I ’m his niece , and I look after the house . Uncle Alberto lives in West Palm . ”
37712	37728	37729	37729	He	176	“ Ah . Well , we have a warrant to search the property , miss . ”
37737	37744	37729	37729	He	176	“ Search it ? For what ? ”
37745	37778	37779	37779	Ari	376	“ Your neighbor who called in the B&E — she identified the burglar as Vincent Giardi . He ’s under investigation by law enforcement , and this is his last known address . ”
37791	37796	37779	37779	Ari	376	“ Investigation for what ? ”
37797	37829	37830	37830	O’Doul	609	“ We ca n’t disclose the details of our investigation . But we believe — and the judge believes — that Mr. Giardi was conducting illegal business activities from this property . ”
37846	37854	37855	37855	Ari	376	“ He does n’t live here now , ”
37858	37875	37855	37855	Ari	376	“ I ’ve been trying to get rid of his stuff in my basement for weeks . ”
37876	37881	37882	37883	the detective	72	“ I hear you , ”
37887	37908	37882	37883	the detective	72	“ But the warrant is valid . Do you mind answering some questions while Officer Brock takes a look around ? ”
37927	37941	37942	37942	He	176	“ So I just have to let them in ? That ’s it ? ”
37953	37978	37979	37980	The detective	72	“ Sweetheart , I know I ’m supposed to be the heavy in this relationship . But I ’ve only seen warrants on television . ”
37999	38003	38004	38004	he	72	“ Call Rebecca , ”
38007	38021	38022	38022	She	376	“ Tell her that you need to talk to a lawyer , stat . ”
38042	38066	38029	38030	The detective	72	“ She ’s not supposed to leave my sight . I was trying to be helpful by not asking you two to leave . ”
38067	38070	38071	38071	Patrick	609	“ Ari ! ”
38077	38086	38087	38087	She	376	“ Can you make your call down here ? ”
38114	38150	38151	38151	She	376	“ Becca ! I ’ve got a situation . Can you pull out whatever file you keep lawyers in ? The douchewhistle has struck again . There are cops searching my house for unlawful activities . ”
38160	38173	38174	38174	Ari	376	“ I appreciate it . You , too , honey . Later . ”
38181	38189	38190	38190	she	376	“ Should n’t you be at practice ? ”
38204	38225	38226	38226	He	982	“ They were n’t going to let me skate this morning anyway . I ’ll check in a bit later . ”
38237	38264	38265	38265	She	376	“ How about I order some egg sandwiches and coffee ? We might as well eat while you wait out the long arm of the law . ”
38270	38290	38265	38265	She	376	“ Okay . I mean , you probably need to get going . So I ’m good either way . ”
38304	38313	38314	38314	He	982	“ I ’m going to call the deli . ”
38330	38336	38337	38337	She	376	“ Unlock this for me ? ”
38447	38463	38464	38465	the detective	72	“ When was the last time Mr. Giardi was inside this portion of the house ? ”
38468	38472	38473	38473	she	376	“ January 28th , ”
38477	38520	38473	38473	she	376	“ I threw him out that night , with my tenant ’s help . We moved all his possessions into the storage room , because it has separate access . I changed my locks that day , but not on the basement . ”
38521	38524	38473	38473	she	376	“ Why ? ”
38525	38598	38473	38473	she	376	“ Because I was not going to put his fancy clothes on the curb ! I was trying to be civilized . But he did n’t get lost like I asked him to . Instead of just removing his stuff , he kept hanging around the place . These past few weeks I kept seeing him out the window , more times than you ’d need to take care of some clothes . ”
38599	38612	38473	38473	she	376	“ When ’s the last time you saw him go in there ? ”
38613	38692	38693	38694	The agent	80	“ Last Thursday . I was on my way to the stadium for the game against D.C. I saw him out the window , and there was another man , too . They were talking . The other guy left first , and then Vince left . On my way to the stadium that afternoon I went outside to try to figure out what he was up to . And I saw that he ’d locked me out . ”
38699	38715	38693	38694	The agent	80	“ Yeah ? Then why did he have to saw open the door last night ? ”
38716	38721	38722	38722	Ari	376	“ Because I retaliated ! ”
38733	38788	38722	38722	Ari	376	“ I had the locksmith remove his locks and add mine . I knew he ’d be pissed off , but I did n’t know how else to make my point . He does n’t answer my e - mails . I ’ve asked him to get his things out of there for weeks . ”
38789	38797	38798	38798	O’Doul	609	“ Would you show me those emails ? ”
38823	38835	38817	38817	he	80	“ Do you want to wait and talk to a lawyer ? ”
38842	38867	38836	38836	She	376	“ I do n’t have anything to hide . I just want this cleared up . And I need a restraining order against him . ”
38868	38879	38880	38880	he	80	“ Now there ’s an idea I can get behind , ”
38977	38982	38983	38983	he	80	“ Hey , man , ”
38988	38998	38983	38983	he	80	“ Mind if I grab my wallet from upstairs ? ”
38999	39012	39013	39013	O’Doul	609	“ Go ahead . I think my guy is done up there . ”
39029	39032	39033	39033	he	80	“ Coffee ? ”
39048	39051	39052	39053	the guy	80	“ Thanks , ”
39056	39060	39052	39053	the guy	80	“ Appreciate it . ”
39077	39080	39081	39081	he	80	“ Honey , ”
39103	39122	39123	39123	Ari	376	“ You want me to get plates ? I do n’t want to get crumbs on your couch . ”
39191	39200	39201	39201	she	993	“ Not as much as you ’d think , ”
39207	39274	39201	39201	she	993	“ Three years ago he had several clubs . But I ’m pretty sure he ’s down to just one . And I think he owes some people money . He never told me his troubles directly , but I heard him on the phone sometimes , and his mood has been really foul since the fall . And that ’s all I can tell you . ”
39275	39282	39309	39309	O’Doul	609	“ How long were you together ? ”
39283	39287	39288	39289	The cop	982	“ Eight years . ”
39294	39308	39288	39289	The cop	982	“ Eight years ? And you do n’t know more about his business ? ”
39330	39432	39324	39324	Ari	376	“ Look , I have my own job , okay ? And Vince did n’t like that so much . And he had a big chest - beating macho streak . When things went wrong , I was the last person he ’d tell . We did n’t do a lot of tell me about your day at work , honey . Besides — his club has a business office . It ’s not like he was running the whole show out of my home . I showed his ass the door , and we have not had a conversation since . ”
39433	39436	39437	39438	The detective	609	“ Okay . ”
39443	39464	39465	39465	She	997	“ Then can you tell me who he worked with ? You must have heard names , or answered calls . ”
39470	39488	39489	39489	Pryzyk	184	“ The co - owned clubs were with the Pryzyks . They were brothers , I think . ”
39503	39509	39510	39511	the detective	609	“ You ever meet them ? ”
39514	39558	39510	39511	the detective	609	“ Once . Maybe a year ago ? I met Vince at his office because we were going to the opera . And they were there . Not the most friendly people . I did n’t feel the urge to see them again . ”
39559	39568	39569	39570	the detective	609	“ So you never socialized with his colleagues ? ”
39586	39603	39604	39604	she	376	“ When I was young and working in Vince ’s first club , I knew everyone , ”
39607	39649	39604	39604	she	376	“ They were my second family . But when I left to do training in yoga and massage therapy , I was n’t around anymore . And the turnover in nightclubs is pretty high . All my favorite people moved on . ”
39650	39653	39654	39655	the detective	609	“ Okay , ”
39667	39683	39654	39655	the detective	609	“ Can you tell me if Vincent ever said anything about drugs in his clubs ? ”
39744	39812	39813	39813	Ari	376	“ Vince told me once that every club had problems with drugs — that it was hard to keep the dealers out . And then , sure enough , one of his clubs kept getting busted and they lost the liquor license . But he did n’t share specifics , and I did n’t ask because he was such a grumpy bastard all the time about it . ”
39838	39861	39862	39862	Ari	376	“ To your knowledge did Vince Giardi ever decide to use the flow of drugs as an opportunity rather than a problem ? ”
39868	39878	39862	39862	Ari	376	“ You mean . . . encourage the dealing ? ”
39879	39886	39887	39888	the agent	990	“ Did he take a cut ? ”
39911	39920	39921	39921	she	376	“ God , I do n’t think so , ”
39925	40018	40019	40019	She	376	“ I mean , he ’d never tell me if he did . But the thing about Vince is that he is n’t really a schemer . He ’d rather pour you a drink and take a spin on the dance floor . Even when he was trying to build up his empire , it was all about the clubs themselves — which A - list celebs were going to show up , which DJs he could book . He got into the business because he wanted to party for a living . ”
40024	40082	40019	40019	She	376	“ I do n’t think he was the best businessman , honestly . I know he had money problems after the one club was shut down . He owed the Pryzyk brothers money , I think . Either that or he owed somebody else money , and he was trying to get the Pryzyks to help him . ”
40083	40090	40091	40091	She	376	“ Why do you think so ? ”
40100	40152	40153	40153	she	376	“ His phone would ring with their name on the screen . He ’d disappear into another room and argue for a while . I got the impression he wanted their help . But I never heard both sides of the conversation . That ’s really all I can tell you , ”
40167	40173	40174	40174	He	72	“ Okay . Thank you . ”
40178	40188	40174	40174	He	72	“ Have you ever heard the name Andre Karsecki ? ”
40189	40194	40195	40195	Ari	376	“ Um . . . ”
40200	40207	40208	40208	O’Doul	609	“ No ? Who ’s that ? ”
40213	40228	40229	40230	The cop	72	“ I saw it in the newspaper — an unsolved murder in a nightclub . ”
40248	40271	40240	40240	Ari	376	“ Look , I told you everything I know about Vince ’s work . I wish I ’d never met the guy . ”
40272	40303	40304	40305	the detective	72	“ We ’re going to inventory the items from your storage room downstairs , and remove the computer we found there . Did you keep any valuables in that room ? ”
40308	40365	40366	40366	He	72	“ Depends who you ask . The collection of vinyl albums is my uncle’s — they’re valuable to him , but I have no idea if they ’re worth any actual money . Aside from a few pieces of old furniture I did n’t want , nothing else in that room was put there by me . ”
40371	40378	40366	40366	He	72	“ Any files ? Any notes ? ”
40379	40384	40385	40385	she	72	“ All Vince ’s , ”
40389	40436	40385	40385	she	72	“ When I looked through the window the other day , I saw a computer I ’d never seen before . I have no idea how he was working out of that room . I changed the Wi - Fi password after he left , too . ”
40437	40443	40444	40445	the cop	72	“ There was a splice , ”
40451	40461	40444	40445	the cop	72	“ A direct line running from your cable connection . ”
40462	40466	40467	40467	Ari	376	“ Damn it ! ”
40470	40474	40467	40467	Ari	376	“ That asshole . ”
40486	40495	40496	40496	O’Doul	609	“ When can she fix the lock again ? ”
40499	40514	40496	40496	O’Doul	609	“ It is n’t safe to leave that open . Someone could take advantage . ”
40515	40528	40529	40530	the detective	72	“ We ’ll call you when we ’re finished with our investigation , ”
40536	40546	40529	40530	the detective	72	“ Should n’t be more than a few days . ”
40547	40553	40554	40554	O’Doul	609	“ Like , maybe tomorrow ? ”
40569	40572	40573	40574	The guy	609	“ Maybe . ”
40578	40594	40573	40574	The guy	609	“ Uh - huh . And how does she get a restraining order against him ? ”
40604	40640	40641	40641	Ari	376	“ That ’s not my specialty , but call my office line and ask my assistant to e - mail you the forms . She ’ll need to go to the courthouse on Jay Street . ”
40656	40666	40641	40641	Ari	376	“ Thank you . I ’ll do that today . ”
40695	40700	40689	40689	he	72	“ Are you okay ? ”
40701	40704	40706	40706	her	376	“ Fine . ”
40718	40738	40739	40739	She	376	“ You ’d better report to the trainers ’ office . They must wonder where the hell you are . ”
40747	40757	40739	40739	She	376	“ Did Becca e - mail you some lawyers ? ”
40758	40765	40766	40766	Ari	376	“ I ’m sure she did . ”
40770	40787	40766	40766	Ari	376	“ Thank you for chatting up the cop . I know you were trying to help , but”—she
40798	40805	40766	40766	Ari	376	toe—“I can take it from here . ”
40806	40809	40810	40810	he	1005	“ Okay , ”
40831	40835	40819	40819	He	1005	“ Be well . ”
41015	41020	41021	41021	Coach	365	“ Got a second ? ”
41045	41051	41052	41052	Coach	365	“ Is there a problem ? ”
41057	41066	41052	41052	Coach	365	“ Just wondering what you think of something . ”
41067	41070	41085	41085	O’Doul	609	“ Shoot . ”
41071	41084	41085	41085	O’Doul	609	“ How do you like the idea of Crikey fighting tomorrow night ? ”
41091	41094	41085	41085	O’Doul	609	“ Why ? ”
41095	41105	41106	41106	Coach	365	“ To take some of the pressure off you , ”
41110	41119	41106	41106	Coach	365	“ Give your strain a little extra cushion . ”
41120	41126	41127	41127	he	365	“ I can handle it , ”
41175	41184	41164	41164	He	365	“ The kid wants to fight , though , ”
41191	41206	41185	41185	Hugh	72	“ This guy Falzgar used to beat the crap out of him in juniors . ”
41207	41245	41254	41254	O’Doul	609	“ So we ’re just gon na let him work out his vendetta in the middle of the game ? That is not a strategy . And Falzgar is a leftie . Has Crikey fought a leftie ? ”
41264	41270	41271	41271	Coach	365	“ We need you healthy , ”
41274	41297	41271	41271	Coach	365	“ You can take tomorrow ’s fight . But only if you are a hundred percent sure you ’re up to it . ”
41298	41302	41303	41303	he	72	“ I am , ”
41320	41343	41314	41314	Hugh	72	“ The salary cap means this team wo n’t ever have another dedicated enforcer . Every player is here for his skills . ”
41344	41348	41349	41349	O’Doul	609	“ I know , ”
41352	41371	41349	41349	O’Doul	609	“ If the fighting gets in the way of your skills , it ’s bad for the team . ”
41372	41375	41376	41376	He	72	“ True . ”
41391	41396	41388	41388	Hugh	72	“ Rest up tonight . ”
41397	41403	41404	41404	He	72	“ Thanks , I will . ”
41689	41699	41700	41700	she	376	“ I ’ll bring a movie and some takeout , ”
41888	41891	41892	41892	Becca	372	“ Ari ? ”
41900	41912	41913	41913	She	376	“ I have Indian food and a DVD of Magic Mike ! ”
41918	41926	41913	41913	She	376	“ Well , step right this way . ”
41958	41965	41947	41947	She	376	“ You look guilty . Why ? ”
41966	41971	41972	41972	Ari	376	“ I do not ! ”
41975	41983	41972	41972	Ari	376	“ You so do . What happened ? ”
41987	42000	42001	42001	she	376	“ Patrick and I attacked each other like horny rabbits last night , ”
42005	42013	42014	42014	Becca	372	“ But it ’s never happening again . ”
42034	42059	42014	42014	Becca	372	“ Wait . Patrick ? As in . . . O’Doul ? You call him Patrick ? Nobody calls him by his first name . ”
42060	42072	42073	42073	She	376	“ Really ? That ’s what you find shocking about this ? ”
42085	42104	42073	42073	She	376	“ My life is a train wreck , and I just made it worse by screwing a client . ”
42105	42122	42014	42014	Becca	372	“ Let ’s not be hasty . Was he good ? Maybe it ’s worth it . ”
42123	42128	42129	42129	Ari	376	“ It was epic , ”
42138	42168	42129	42129	Ari	376	“ Then again , for the past few years I ’ve only had sex with someone who resented me half the time . So maybe my viewpoint is skewed . ”
42169	42172	42173	42173	Becca	372	“ God . ”
42180	42233	42234	42234	She	372	“ These days , even a night with someone who resented me sounds appealing . Why do you think I own Channing Tatum on DVD ? Because I get no action . All day I ’m surrounded by hard bodies at work , and yet my vibrator is always on the charger . ”
42245	42253	42254	42254	Ari	376	“ You could hook up , though , ”
42258	42290	42254	42254	Ari	376	“ It would be less scandalous for you to get busy with a player than for me . You do n’t have to touch their bodies in the line of duty . ”
42291	42299	42300	42300	Becca	372	“ You ’d think nobody would care , ”
42312	42368	42300	42300	Becca	372	“ But once when Castro was having a shitty day I got him drunk in a hotel bar . Nate saw us all cozy and laughing in a booth at the bar and got the wrong impression . He was cold to me for a while after that . So I ’m not going there . ”
42377	42384	42300	42300	Becca	372	“ Seriously ? Nate got mad ? ”
42385	42408	42413	42413	Ari	376	“ Hell yes . I swear I did n’t imagine it . He was kind of a dick to Castro , too . ”
42409	42412	42413	42413	Ari	376	“ Shit , ”
42416	42433	42413	42413	Ari	376	“ I ca n’t risk my job . I ’m going to swear Patrick to secrecy . ”
42434	42441	42442	42442	Becca	372	“ He ’s a decent guy , ”
42452	42488	42442	42442	Becca	372	“ He puts up an asshole front , and he ’s kind of an egomaniac . But he ’s got that whole macho honor code thing working . So I think you ’ll be fine . ”
42489	42492	42494	42494	she	372	“ Ugh . ”
42515	42540	42442	42442	Becca	372	“ How did it happen , anyway ? Did he give you that overconfident squint and say , hey , baby , wanna bang ? ”
42541	42596	42597	42597	Becca	372	“ No ! Geez . We did n’t talk about it first . He got out of the taxi here and helped me make sure the house was secure . And then we just looked at each other and . . . it was like someone pulled the pin on a grenade . Kapow . ”
42611	42638	42597	42597	Becca	372	“ Oh , man . Just once in my life I want to feel like that . I had so many bad first dates last year . ”
42648	42653	42639	42639	She	372	“ Nothing went kapow . ”
42803	42809	42798	42798	Becca	372	“ Should you check that ? ”
42810	42816	42818	42818	she	372	“ Oh , I suppose . ”
42899	42918	42919	42919	Ari	376	“ Omigod . Did O’Doul text you ? You should see the look on your face right now . ”
42925	42935	42919	42919	Ari	376	“ He ’s just making sure I ’m okay . ”
42936	42941	42942	42942	Becca	372	“ Uh - huh . ”
42947	42962	42942	42942	Becca	372	“ If he ’s on his way over here I ’ll make myself scarce . ”
42963	42984	42919	42919	Ari	376	“ No ! That is not happening . Start the movie . We ’re just up to the good part . ”
42985	42993	42994	42994	Becca	372	“ It ’s all the good part , ”
42998	43017	43020	43020	he	609	“ But you ’d better reply or he ’ll be knocking on your door five minutes from now . ”
43080	43087	43088	43088	she	372	“ He ’s flirting with you ! ”
43096	43103	43092	43092	she	372	“ This is so high school , ”
43125	43133	43134	43134	Becca	372	“ What the hell did you do ? ”
43143	43155	43156	43156	Becca	372	“ Wash what ? You ’re going to get me fired . ”
43159	43170	43156	43156	Becca	372	“ It was supposed to say watch . Damn autocorrect . ”
43182	43189	43179	43179	Ari	376	“ I ’m afraid to look . ”
43190	43195	43196	43196	Becca	372	“ I ’ll look ! ”
43265	43272	43273	43273	Becca	372	“ You ’ve seen his shower ? ”
43282	43294	43273	43273	Becca	372	“ I thought he did n’t let people into his apartment ? ”
43339	43354	43328	43328	Becca	372	“ I ca n’t even with this . Who knew O’Doul was a romantic ? ”
43379	43386	43355	43355	Ari	376	“ More Tatum . Less talking . ”
43503	43507	43508	43508	she	376	“ Good morning , ”
43520	43529	43508	43508	she	376	“ How are your hip flexors feeling today ? ”
43620	43625	43626	43626	he	609	“ Hi , sweetheart , ”
43630	43635	43636	43636	Gulp	197	“ You doing okay ? ”
43638	43644	43645	43645	she	376	“ I ’m doing well , ”
43659	43705	43645	43645	she	376	“ I got an order of protection , and hired a process server to track Vince down to serve it . And the lawyer Becca recommended is ready to step in if the cops try to tie me to any of Vince ’s shady dealings . ”
43706	43711	43712	43712	Patrick	609	“ That ’s good , ”
43748	43754	43729	43729	he	609	“ No Pearl Jam today ? ”
43755	43764	43765	43765	She	376	“ Um , I can turn it on . ”
43779	43787	43788	43788	His	609	“ After we have a quick chat . ”
43801	43808	43796	43796	he	609	“ What ’s on your mind ? ”
43809	43825	43788	43788	His	609	“ It ’s about the other night . We ca n’t have a repeat performance . ”
43826	43831	43832	43832	he	609	“ Of course not , ”
43867	43879	43880	43880	he	609	“ . . . I mean , not an exact repeat , ”
43883	43903	43880	43880	he	609	“ I like to mix it up a little . The shower sounds good . Up against the wall . ”
43904	43907	43908	43908	she	376	“ Patrick , ”
43911	43927	43928	43928	She	376	“ I ’m not joking . We obviously have a bit of chemistry . . . ”
43952	43976	43949	43949	He	609	“ We have a bit of chemistry . And hockey has a bit of violence . We practically burned down your bed together . ”
43981	44007	44008	44008	He	609	“ Be that as it may , I need this job . It ’s the only part of my life that did n’t just implode . ”
44019	44027	44008	44008	He	609	“ I would never jeopardize your job . ”
44028	44032	44008	44008	He	609	“ Thank you . ”
44033	44064	44008	44008	He	609	“ But I call bullshit . If you want to give me the brush - off you ’re going to have to do a little better than that flimsy excuse . ”
44065	44089	44008	44008	He	609	“ It is n’t flimsy ! I have it on good authority that Nate does n’t like his staff , um . . . ”
44090	44104	44008	44008	He	609	“ . . . Making the players come so hard they see stars ? ”
44105	44116	44117	44117	He	609	“ I would have put it differently . But yes . ”
44120	44139	44117	44117	He	609	“ And yet Georgia is marrying Leo . I do n’t see her looking for a new job . ”
44140	44149	44150	44150	She	828	“ Her dad is the coach ? Hello ? ”
44161	44167	44168	44168	she	828	“ You seem tight today , ”
44172	44184	44168	44168	she	828	“ It wore off , I guess . Your latest treatment . ”
44185	44201	44117	44117	He	609	“ Well , it ’s been a few days since you were on the table . ”
44202	44211	44212	44212	She	828	“ That ’s not the treatment I meant . ”
44219	44226	44212	44212	She	828	“ Do n’t make that joke . ”
44235	44272	44212	44212	She	828	“ I ’m not a prude , and I do n’t think it ’s all that big of a deal to , um , get carried away one night with a friend from work . But this here”—she
44275	44322	44212	44212	She	828	room—“is my professional space . I would n’t ever touch a client inappropriately . It would violate the trust that you give me when you climb onto my table . And I ’m sorry if that sounds really nitpicky , but the distinction matters to me . ”
44345	44348	44336	44336	she	828	“ Sorry . ”
44358	44371	44350	44350	Patrick	609	“ I understand , baby . I wo n’t tease you anymore . ”
44372	44376	44336	44336	she	828	“ Thank you . ”
44377	44383	44384	44384	She	828	“ Not here , anyway . ”
44393	44410	44384	44384	She	828	“ Can I have Pearl Jam , at least ? I ’ll be a good boy . ”
44411	44417	44418	44418	She	828	“ Yes , you can . ”
44434	44449	44384	44384	She	828	“ Now tell me why you ’re so stiff , without using any innuendo . ”
44450	44473	44384	44384	She	828	“ You take all my fun away . Fine . Tonight we play Buffalo and I have to fight this asshole Falzgar . ”
44474	44484	44485	44485	she	828	“ And you ’re not looking forward to it , ”
44488	44496	44485	44485	she	828	“ Ca n’t say that I am . ”
44497	44513	44514	44514	She	828	“ Let ’s work those hip flexors , shall we ? Roll to the side . ”
44692	44706	44683	44683	Patrick	609	“ Something the matter ? I thought you liked ‘ Better Man ’ ? ”
44707	44719	44720	44720	His	609	“ Eh . That song is n’t my favorite right now . ”
44733	44741	44725	44725	he	609	“ It hits too close to home ? ”
44763	44793	44794	44794	His	609	“ The girl in the song stays with a guy who is n’t good to her . I never thought I was that girl , and then I was . ”
44801	44825	44794	44794	His	609	“ This is a serious problem now . We ca n’t let that asshole put you off a perfectly good Pearl Jam tune . ”
44826	44831	44832	44832	Ari	376	“ I ’ll manage . ”
44843	44848	44849	44849	He	609	“ No , babe . ”
44862	44878	44879	44879	He	609	“ Turn over if you ’re going to talk . You ’re wrecking your alignment . ”
44883	44896	44879	44879	He	609	“ The thing is , I think you ’ve misinterpreted the song . ”
44897	44905	44879	44879	He	609	“ I really do n’t think so . ”
44906	44920	44879	44879	He	609	“ That song is really about a girl who ’s making some toast . ”
44921	44924	44925	44925	Her	828	“ Toast ? ”
44941	44956	44932	44932	His	609	“ Yeah . See , she ’s standing in front of the refrigerator . And she”—he
44959	44979	44932	44932	His	609	song—“can’t find the butter , man ! She ca n’t find the butter , maa - aa - aan . ”
44980	44986	44987	44987	she	828	“ Oh . My god , ”
44990	44998	44999	44999	He	609	“ That is the worst pun ever . ”
45014	45029	44999	44999	He	609	“ You ’re smiling now , though . So I think I did okay . ”
45087	45104	45076	45076	He	609	“ I think I ’m getting the hang of this massage thing . You schooled me . ”
45120	45133	45134	45134	He	609	“ You could teach a course on how to get a massage . ”
45137	45161	45162	45162	She	828	“ Massage for Dummies . Chapter one — how to lie on a table and let a beautiful woman touch your naked body . ”
45167	45187	45162	45162	She	828	“ Do n’t do that — don’t make fun of yourself for not liking it . Everyone is different . ”
45193	45217	45162	45162	She	828	“ But I do like it now . Do n’t even think about quitting this place , because I ’m used to you . ”
45218	45242	45162	45162	She	828	“ I have no plans to quit . It ’s too much fun making a room full of hockey players do sun salutations . ”
45243	45252	45253	45253	he	609	“ Does n’t it bug you , though ? ”
45257	45282	45162	45162	She	828	“ You teach us a whole lot of Zen shit , and then we use it to beat the crap out of each other . ”
45283	45297	45298	45298	His	609	“ I want business cards with that title — Teacher of Zen Shit . ”
45306	45313	45298	45298	His	609	“ You know what I mean . ”
45314	45376	45162	45162	She	828	“ It does n’t bother me at all . In the first place , there ’s plenty I admire about your team . The dedication to success is impressive . And I like working with people who understand their bodies . I never have to convince an athlete that a mind - body connection exists . You guys all get it . ”
45377	45385	45386	45386	he	609	“ But you still hate the fighting , ”
45389	45397	45398	45398	she	1055	“ The fighting is n’t my favorite , ”
45401	45413	45398	45398	she	1055	“ But I do n’t think it ’s your favorite either . ”
45414	45420	45421	45421	he	609	“ Not all the time , ”
45424	45466	45421	45421	he	609	“ The hours before a fight are the worst . I spend a lot of time worrying about how to make this guy my bitch without getting too hurt , while he tries to make me his bitch without getting hurt . ”
45467	45473	45474	45474	He	609	“ So you get anxious . ”
45479	45486	45474	45474	He	609	“ It ’s more like dread . ”
45487	45492	45494	45495	macho men	1056	“ Okay , dread . ”
45503	45526	45527	45527	His	609	“ Maybe we can find you a meditation for those hours . Something that redirects your energy in a more positive way . ”
45532	45544	45527	45527	His	609	“ I do n’t think I ’m very good at meditating . ”
45545	45550	45551	45551	Ari	376	“ Neither am I , ”
45554	45605	45551	45551	Ari	376	“ But that does n’t mean it is n’t helping . An old Buddhist monk told me once that the mind is like an untrained monkey . If you do n’t give it something to do , it will tear your house apart and smear shit on all the walls . ”
45606	45609	45616	45616	her	376	“ Really ? ”
45627	45635	45618	45618	Patrick	609	“ I want to meet this monk . ”
45636	45666	45667	45667	Patrick	609	“ Really . He said meditation gives your monkey something better to do . Even if you think you ’re bad at it , the monkey is still busy . ”
45677	45734	45667	45667	Patrick	609	“ I like your style , sweetheart . But I ca n’t always connect to the meditations you give us during yoga . It ’s like I ca n’t shut off my cynical brain . You tell me to soar like an eagle , and I ’m thinking , there are n’t any eagles in Brooklyn . ”
45735	45759	45618	45618	Patrick	609	“ Uh - huh . So you need the Brooklyn version of a guided meditation ? More trash on the beach ? Fuhggeddaboudit ? ”
45760	45763	45667	45667	Patrick	609	“ Yeah . ”
45764	45774	45775	45775	He	1057	“ I can do that . Close your eyes . ”
45788	45798	45799	45799	she	1057	“ I want you to listen to my voice , ”
45813	45840	45799	45799	she	1057	“ Do your best to follow my instructions . Take a deep , slow breath and will yourself to be fully here , inside the moment . ”
45849	45889	45890	45890	He	1057	“ . . . Make a calm space inside yourself for your breath . Let the inhale fill you with strength . On the exhale , I want you to gradually expel all the bullshit of the external world . ”
45905	45910	45911	45911	she	1057	“ That ’s it , ”
45914	45957	45958	45958	His	1057	“ Center your awareness on your breathing . If you find your mind wandering to other thoughts , simply acknowledge that all is fucking horseshit . Let it go . Listen to your inner stillness . Breathe in calm . Exhale bullshit . ”
45966	45991	45992	45992	She	1057	“ You think I ’m not serious ? Meditation can sound however you need it to . It ’s your show , big man . ”
46008	46019	45997	45997	He	1057	“ You are priceless . I hope you know that . ”
46020	46024	46025	46025	she	1057	“ Thank you , ”
46043	46053	46055	46055	his	1057	“ And now unfortunately we are out of time . ”
46245	46248	46249	46249	Beringer	2020	“ Hey ! ”
46252	46268	46249	46249	Beringer	2020	“ You have fifty - one percent on HockeyBrawls.com ! I call that a win . ”
46269	46278	46279	46279	Beacon	172	“ I see fifty - one point four ! ”
46288	46296	46279	46279	Beacon	172	“ Another beer for the point four ! ”
46356	46359	46360	46360	He	1061	“ Pete . ”
46369	46400	46401	46401	Pete	327	“ I want to take care of whatever these assholes drink tonight . Can you run it now and just cash me out later ? I ’m sneakin ’ out . ”
46407	46426	46401	46401	Pete	327	“ I ’ll e - mail the bill to Rebecca . That ’s what we did last time . ”
46427	46431	46432	46432	He	1061	“ Good man . ”
46490	46494	46495	46495	He	1061	“ You ass . ”
46498	46507	46495	46495	He	1061	“ I answer to that all the time . ”
46519	46524	46511	46511	she	376	“ Had enough scotch ? ”
46525	46529	46530	46530	She	376	“ Had plenty . ”
46537	46541	46530	46530	She	376	“ You okay ? ”
46542	46547	46548	46548	He	1061	“ Course I am . ”
46556	46572	46548	46548	He	1061	“ Did n’t even have to take a punch tonight , so I ’m solid . ”
46588	46596	46597	46597	He	1061	“ This muscle looks unhappy , though . ”
46612	46623	46597	46597	He	1061	“ It ’s a weird night , that ’s all . ”
46624	46633	46634	46634	Women	202	“ Are you pissed at Crikey for fighting ? ”
46643	46664	46634	46634	Women	202	“ I was . But he seems pretty happy with the outcome . I used to be just like that . ”
46665	46669	46597	46597	He	1061	“ Like what ? ”
46670	46744	46745	46745	She	1069	“ Sort of incredulous about the whole thing . I was young and stupid and they paid me a half million dollars a year to do something that used to get me thrown out of school . I thought I ’d cracked the secret code of the universe , you know ? People wanted my autograph , even though I was really just a thug trying to smash his demons for high pay . ”
46752	46758	46745	46745	She	1069	“ But it got old ? ”
46759	46803	46634	46634	Women	202	“ Fuck yeah . It ’s hell on your body . And then it ’s too late — you’re already that guy who fights . So you have to fight everybody for the rest of your career . I ca n’t just stop . ”
46804	46808	46809	46809	He	1070	“ Why not ? ”
46821	46921	46809	46809	He	1070	“ There ’s no shame in being a player who does n’t fight . A lot of guys just do n’t know how , or they ’re too valuable as snipers . If Bayer or Trevi fucked up his hand , it would be a scoring disaster . But if I start refusing to fight , I ’m a guy who backs down . They ’d say — look at that poor old fucker . He ca n’t take it . If people do n’t see me like that I can still have another few years in the league . ”
46922	46950	46951	46951	He	783	“ Maybe Crikey wants to take some of the pressure off you . If there ’re two enforcers , neither of you has to do it all . ”
46954	46986	46951	46951	He	783	“ Like a job share . If some hammerhead challenges me on the rink , I can just say , talk to Crikey . I do n’t throw down on Thursdays . ”
46987	46994	46995	46995	He	783	“ It was just a thought . ”
47020	47111	46951	46951	He	783	“ I know . I appreciate it . And Crikey has no idea what he ’s getting into . Maybe it seemed like a big adventure tonight . But next month maybe he hurts somebody really bad . Or he loses a fight and people jeer and throw food at him . He does n’t know all the shit that can happen . He does n’t know to wonder if some asshole fan goes home drunk after the game and tries to imitate your signature left hook on his wife . ”
47112	47115	47000	47000	her	783	“ Jesus . ”
47116	47120	46951	46951	He	783	“ You asked . ”
47138	47141	46951	46951	He	783	“ Sorry . ”
47142	47155	46951	46951	He	783	“ No , I want to know what ’s in your head . ”
47156	47159	47160	47160	She	1072	“ Why ? ”
47171	47199	47160	47160	She	1072	“ I think you like me , Ariana . S’okay , though . You do n’t have to admit it . It can be our little secret . ”
47200	47206	47207	47207	she	1072	“ You passed your street , ”
47212	47227	47207	47207	she	1072	“ No kidding . I ’m walking the lady home . It ’s late . ”
47234	47246	47207	47207	she	1072	“ I appreciate it . But I ’m going in alone . ”
47247	47253	47254	47254	he	783	“ Of course you are , ”
47340	47346	47331	47331	He	783	“ Good night , sweetheart . ”
47347	47351	47352	47352	She	1072	“ Good night . ”
47362	47369	47352	47352	She	1072	“ Thanks for walking me home . ”
47622	47631	47616	47616	Ari	376	“ Good night , sweetheart . Sleep well . ”
47665	47671	47655	47655	she	1072	“ Good night , Patrick . ”
47694	47705	47706	47706	She	1080	“ Let me hear you lock that door behind you . ”
48446	48458	48432	48432	Trevor	205	“ Hugh Major would like a word with you in private . ”
48468	48472	48473	48473	she	467	“ Thank you , ”
48617	48621	48609	48609	She	467	“ Come in ! ”
48648	48655	48635	48635	Patrick	609	“ You wanted to see me ? ”
48656	48670	48674	48674	she	467	“ Sit down , Ariana . We have a bit of a situation . ”
48732	48773	48722	48722	Hugh	72	“ Ariana , it seems you have a stalker . O’Doul brought it to my attention , but I do need you to know that you can always ask the organization for help with any security issues you ’re facing . ”
48868	48873	48874	48874	Patrick	609	“ Turn it over , ”
48937	48944	48945	48945	Patrick	609	“ Where did it come from ? ”
48959	48985	48945	48945	Patrick	609	“ It was delivered to the Bruisers offices this morning in an unmarked envelope . But it ’s not hard to guess who sent it . ”
48992	48996	48997	48997	she	467	“ My ex , ”
49023	49028	49008	49008	she	467	“ I ’m sorry . ”
49029	49034	49035	49035	Hugh	72	“ No , Ari , ”
49038	49084	49085	49085	He	72	“ Do n’t apologize . This is n’t your fault . But we ’re really good at security around here . You can tell us if there ’s a problem . I ’m going to ask our security team to make you a panic button . ”
49099	49137	49138	49138	Yikes	146	“ It ’s a little device this big . You can wear it around your neck . If you push the button , Kattenberger Technologies routes the emergency to law enforcement and our private team , too . ”
49140	49147	49148	49148	she	146	“ That ’s really not necessary , ”
49180	49198	49175	49175	Hugh	72	“ I think it is . I hear you have an order of protection against this asshole ? ”
49199	49204	49205	49205	she	146	“ I got one , ”
49222	49243	49205	49205	she	146	“ But it has n’t been served to him yet . The process server I hired ca n’t find him . ”
49265	49292	49293	49293	Ari	376	“ I want you to keep me apprised of the situation , okay ? This guy involved my organization when he sent the photo to O’Doul . ”
49305	49332	49333	49333	Hugh	72	“ The reason we employ such an excellent security staff is that our athletes draw all kinds of unwanted attention . That ’s not your fault , ”
49337	49383	49333	49333	Hugh	72	“ The moment you joined our organization , your security needs changed . There will always be assholes who want to try to use your access to the team for their own ends . That ’s why we ’re equipped to handle situations like this . ”
49384	49388	49389	49389	she	376	“ I understand , ”
49409	49426	49400	49400	Hugh	72	“ Would you mind providing my security team with a copy of your order of protection ? ”
49427	49430	49431	49431	she	376	“ Sure , ”
49444	49509	49400	49400	Hugh	72	“ Thank you . I ’m turning this over to the security team when we land . But I ’ll need you to report the photo to the police who opened the file after your break - in . I ’ll email you a scan of the front and back . If they want the original , they can have that in two days . ”
49510	49518	49519	49519	she	376	“ I ’ll send it to them , ”
49530	49544	49522	49522	Hugh	72	“ Hang in there . Nobody ’s gon na let him near you . ”
49545	49549	49550	49550	She	376	“ Thank you . ”
49565	49572	49573	49573	Patrick	609	“ Ariana , I ’m sorry , ”
49841	49852	49853	49853	Castro	72	“ Let ’s pick a place with dancing this time , ”
49856	49866	49867	49867	Beringer	2020	“ Curfew is in an hour and a half , ”
49870	49878	49879	49879	Ari	376	“ Let ’s just pick someplace close . ”
49898	49903	49904	49904	he	609	“ Hi , sweetheart , ”
49921	49924	49925	49925	she	376	“ Hi , ”
49982	49986	49987	49987	she	376	“ What floor ? ”
49991	49994	49987	49987	she	376	“ Seven . ”
50005	50016	49995	49995	She	376	“ I guess we ’re going to the same place . ”
50037	50042	50043	50043	he	609	“ We ’re neighbors , ”
50046	50051	50043	50043	he	609	“ I see that . ”
50101	50104	50107	50107	boy	617	“ Ari ? ”
50131	50136	50118	50118	she	376	“ What is it ? ”
50137	50145	50146	50146	He	617	“ I ’m sorry about the picture . ”
50154	50174	50146	50146	He	617	“ I know you hate that Hugh saw it . I think it ’s fine , but . . . ”
50175	50192	50118	50118	she	376	“ It ’s not fine . I do n’t want to be everyone ’s gossip nugget . ”
50193	50198	50199	50199	he	617	“ I get that , ”
50203	50217	50218	50218	She	376	“ I ’d never have shown that photo to Hugh without your permission . ”
50224	50230	50218	50218	She	376	“ Then why did you ? ”
50231	50284	50118	50118	she	376	“ I did n’t . This envelope got dropped off at the office with my name on it — no return address . We get that shit sometimes . Instead of passing it to me , they gave it to the security team . They opened it and showed it to Hugh . ”
50285	50288	50218	50218	She	376	“ Oh . ”
50304	50332	50298	50298	Patrick	609	“ I ’m sorry if you ’re embarrassed . But I wo n’t apologize for kissing you . I ca n’t , because I ’m not sorry . ”
50407	50413	50399	50399	Patrick	609	“ Can I come in ? ”
50414	50418	50399	50399	Patrick	609	“ Absolutely not . ”
50419	50426	50399	50399	Patrick	609	“ Why ? Nobody will know . ”
50427	50438	50439	50439	He	609	“ That ’s what I used to assume , too . ”
50444	50468	50439	50439	He	609	“ The horse is already out of the barn , sweetheart . Why do the time if we ca n’t do the crime ? ”
50469	50478	50479	50479	He	609	“ It ’s just not a good idea . ”
50490	50496	50497	50497	he	609	“ I think it is , ”
50512	50517	50503	50503	His	609	“ You feel tight . ”
50518	50526	50497	50497	he	609	“ It ’s been a stressful day . ”
50527	50533	50497	50497	he	609	“ Too many massage appointments ? ”
50534	50540	50503	50503	His	609	“ Too much shitty news . ”
50541	50544	50545	50545	he	609	“ Mmm , ”
50557	50562	50563	50563	She	376	“ Who massages you ? ”
50566	50569	50563	50563	She	376	“ Nobody . ”
50570	50579	50497	50497	he	609	“ Uh - huh . Want a massage ? ”
50580	50595	50563	50563	She	376	“ I do n’t know . Would it be a prelude to something else ? ”
50596	50603	50604	50604	She	376	“ Is that a deal breaker ? ”
50614	50624	50604	50604	She	376	“ Depends . How skillful is your massage technique ? ”
50625	50645	50646	50646	She	376	“ For a guy who does n’t like to touch people , I ’d say I ’m pretty decent . ”
50649	50661	50646	50646	She	376	“ What the hell am I going to do with you ? ”
50662	50672	50673	50673	He	609	“ I ’m gon na let you find out . ”
50707	50716	50717	50717	he	609	“ Wait here . Where ’s your table ? ”
50723	50730	50717	50717	he	609	“ Oh . There it is . ”
50795	50804	50785	50785	he	609	“ Okay , sweetheart . Time to strip . ”
50814	50837	50805	50805	She	376	“ Really ? You ’re going to massage me ? Or are we , like , writing a porno flick right now ? ”
50848	50859	50838	50838	He	609	“ A little of both . Just work with me . ”
50883	50893	50894	50894	Ari	376	“ This is going to be so much fun . ”
51017	51027	50994	50994	She	376	“ Let ’s see your technique , big man . ”
51028	51041	51042	51042	he	609	“ All right , miss . Are you comfortable on the table ? ”
51045	51060	51061	51061	She	376	“ Do you have any pain or trouble spots I need to know about ? ”
51064	51071	51061	51061	She	376	“ I ’m fine , thanks . ”
51072	51075	51076	51076	He	609	“ Good . ”
51085	51109	51076	51076	He	609	“ Let me know if you feel too much pressure at any point . Massage does n’t have to hurt to do good . ”
51110	51120	51061	51061	She	376	“ Some smart person must have taught you that . ”
51121	51125	51126	51126	He	609	“ The smartest . ”
51262	51265	51266	51266	she	376	“ Omigod , ”
51279	51287	51266	51266	she	376	“ Arrrgh , that feels so good . ”
51288	51296	51269	51269	he	609	“ Not too much pressure , miss ? ”
51297	51304	51305	51305	she	376	“ Oh - hell - no , ”
51308	51313	51269	51269	he	609	“ Do n’t stop . ”
51314	51323	51324	51324	She	376	“ That ’s what all the ladies say . ”
51368	51377	51378	51378	he	609	“ Why do n’t you turn over now , ”
51386	51389	51378	51378	he	609	“ Mmkay . ”
51572	51578	51579	51579	he	609	“ Arms over your head , ”
51620	51623	51624	51624	she	376	“ Oh , ”
51786	51793	51794	51794	she	376	“ Oh . . . geez , ”

51893	51896	51897	51897	He	609	“ Hmm . ”
51905	51911	51897	51897	He	609	“ So I should continue ? ”
51912	51915	51897	51897	He	609	“ Absolutely . ”
51916	51922	51897	51897	He	609	“ Very well , miss . ”
52154	52157	52135	52135	he	609	“ Oh ! ”
52221	52235	52214	52214	His	609	“ I ’m going to fuck you , miss . Nice and deep . ”
52236	52241	52242	52242	she	376	“ Y - yes , ”
52247	52251	52252	52252	He	609	“ Like this . ”
52345	52349	52350	52350	he	609	“ Turn over , ”
52356	52363	52350	52350	he	609	“ Want to watch you come . ”
52482	52493	52467	52467	he	609	“ Fuck . I ’ll never get enough of you . ”
52518	52521	52522	52522	she	376	“ Harder , ”
52607	52610	52611	52611	he	609	“ Mmm , ”
52614	52617	52611	52611	he	609	“ Fuck . ”
52674	52677	52660	52660	he	609	“ Ohhh . ”
52697	52699	52700	52700	Patrick	609	“ Miss. ”
52703	52708	52700	52700	Patrick	609	“ Touch your breasts . ”
52730	52733	52734	52734	he	609	“ Fuck , ”
52861	52864	52865	52865	Ari	376	“ Wow , ”
52957	52960	52961	52961	he	609	“ Hi , ”
52964	52967	52968	52968	She	376	“ Hi . ”
52974	52985	52968	52968	She	376	“ I have a future in massage therapy , right ? ”
52986	53000	52968	52968	She	376	“ Uh - huh . Your technique is nonstandard , but highly effective . ”
53001	53006	52968	52968	She	376	“ You feel relaxed ? ”
53007	53010	53011	53011	He	609	“ Yup . ”
53095	53108	53109	53109	he	609	“ I know you hate it that Hugh wants to get involved , ”
53112	53121	53122	53122	She	376	“ But I think you should let him . ”
53125	53151	53122	53122	She	376	“ I know you ’re all just watching out for me . And it ’s not like I do n’t think he ’s a threat . ”
53162	53182	53122	53122	She	376	“ But now I ’m the girl who fools around at work and the girl with the crazy ex . ”
53183	53189	53190	53190	He	609	“ I know you worry . ”
53196	53209	53190	53190	He	609	“ But I do n’t think Hugh cares if we ’re together . ”
53210	53216	53217	53217	she	376	“ We are not together , ”
53245	53250	53251	53251	he	609	“ Uh - huh , ”
53262	53268	53251	53251	he	609	“ But we should be . ”
53269	53278	53279	53279	He	609	“ Why ? Besides the outrageously good sex . ”
53285	53294	53279	53279	He	609	“ That ’s not a good enough reason ? ”
53295	53299	53300	53300	He	609	“ Fuck no . ”
53313	53336	53304	53304	she	376	“ Because you ’re funny and smart . You ’re the coolest chick I know , and I like you a lot . ”
53355	53410	53447	53447	she	376	“ That ’s really nice of you to say , but I ca n’t be with anybody right now . I have n’t been single since I was twenty - one years old , and my only ex is on a crime spree . The universe might be trying to send me a message . ”
53411	53420	53421	53421	he	1146	“ I ’m not that guy , Ari , ”
53434	53439	53440	53440	she	376	“ I know that , ”
53488	53525	53468	53469	A girl	455	“ Then you should also know that it ’s not like me to tell someone how much I like her . In fact , I want you to guess how many times I ’ve done that . ”
53526	53533	53447	53447	she	376	“ Wait , you keep track ? ”
53534	53538	53468	53469	A girl	455	“ Guess so . ”
53539	53545	53468	53469	A girl	455	“ I ca n’t guess . ”
53546	53551	53468	53469	A girl	455	“ Fine . One . ”
53557	53562	53468	53469	A girl	455	“ One other time ? ”
53563	53571	53468	53469	A girl	455	“ Nope . One including right now . ”
53572	53575	53577	53577	he	609	“ Oh . ”
53582	53587	53588	53588	He	609	“ I ’m honored . ”
53593	53598	53588	53588	He	609	“ You should be . ”
53599	53608	53588	53588	He	609	“ We still ca n’t date , though . ”
53609	53612	53613	53613	She	455	“ Okay . ”
53618	53621	53622	53622	She	455	“ Okay ? ”
53642	53665	53629	53629	He	609	“ I ’ll take what I can get , sweetheart . Now get some sleep . I ’ve got a game tomorrow . ”
53872	53879	53880	53880	Coach	365	“ You look good this morning , ”
53888	53892	53893	53893	he	609	“ Feel good , ”
53896	53903	53893	53893	he	609	“ You okay to fight tonight ? ”
53904	53907	53908	53908	he	609	“ Sure , ”
53951	53956	53957	53957	O’Doul	609	“ Hey , man ! ”
54021	54024	54008	54009	the man	2113	“ Hey ! ”
54033	54038	54008	54009	the man	2113	“ Got a sec ? ”
54039	54046	54047	54047	DiCoda	213	“ Sure . What ’s up ? ”
54050	54058	54059	54059	He	2113	“ My jaw is acting up again . ”
54067	54080	54059	54059	He	2113	“ Might need surgery , actually . Ca n’t fight you tonight . ”
54081	54088	54103	54103	DiCoda	213	“ Fuck , I ’m sorry . ”
54089	54094	54095	54097	The other man	2113	“ Yeah , thanks . ”
54151	54156	54157	54157	O’Doul	609	“ So . . . ”
54162	54192	54193	54193	DiCoda	213	“ Are your guys gon na stay in line tonight ? I do n’t want to have to throw down with some kid who does n’t know any better . ”
54196	54222	54193	54193	DiCoda	213	“ I do n’t think any of ’em have plans to take you on , so I ’ll tell ’em not to piss you off . ”
54223	54227	54228	54228	O’Doul	609	“ Good man , ”
54240	54243	54232	54233	the guy	2113	“ Later , ”
54761	54769	54770	54771	The kid	365	“ Hey man . Where ’s breakfast ? ”
54779	54806	54770	54771	The kid	365	“ In the conference room behind me . That ’s why I ’m standing here like an idiot , to make sure you guys find it . ”
54820	54842	54809	54809	Jimbo	136	“ Come on , then . Let ’s eat . Anyone misbehaving today ? Do I have to knock any heads ? ”
54843	54863	54868	54868	O’Doul	609	“ Nope . The charter company did n’t even lose anyone ’s luggage . But the day is young . ”
55034	55041	55042	55042	Leo	372	“ How ’s tricks , captain ? ”
55045	55056	55042	55042	Leo	372	“ Did n’t see you at the bar last night . ”
55057	55061	55062	55062	he	372	“ Too tired , ”
55076	55087	55070	55070	he	372	“ Hey — college boy . I got a question . ”
55088	55091	55042	55042	Leo	372	“ Shoot . ”
55092	55111	55112	55112	Leo	372	“ What do you do if the girl you ’re meant to be with wo n’t date you ? ”
55120	55146	55112	55112	Leo	372	“ Well , if you ’re me , you date people you really do n’t like for five or six years until she comes around . ”
55147	55150	55112	55112	Leo	372	“ Huh . ”
55177	55184	55185	55185	he	372	“ Who has a better answer ? ”
55191	55194	55195	55195	Beacon	172	“ Well , ”
55205	55219	55195	55195	Beacon	172	“ you can get her pregnant when you ’re both eighteen and clueless . ”

55336	55347	55348	55348	Beringer	2020	“ Cap’n , why wo n’t this girl date you ? ”
55351	55392	55393	55393	He	609	“ You ’re not my type or anything , but I ’ll bet the ladies see a rich guy who ’s not too ugly . The world is full of women who ’d make time in their schedule for you . ”
55396	55425	55393	55393	He	609	“ Thanks , B. My face is n’t the problem . She just got out of a relationship that ended badly . Does n’t wanna go back there . ”
55426	55433	55434	55434	Castro	72	“ That ’s cool , though , ”
55437	55458	55434	55434	Castro	72	“ You can just be her rebound guy . Plenty of sex , no commitment . Sounds good to me . ”
55459	55462	55463	55463	O’Doul	609	“ Nah , ”
55466	55471	55463	55463	O’Doul	609	“ I want more . ”
55472	55476	55477	55477	Castro	72	“ But why ? ”
55482	55506	55477	55477	Castro	72	“ In Canada we have this saying — you do n’t need your own rink if you can get ice time for free . ”
55529	55541	55542	55543	Leo Trevi	372	“ So , she just got out of a bad scene , ”
55547	55565	55542	55543	Leo Trevi	372	“ Maybe her ex had some bad habits . Maybe he did n’t treat her very well . ”
55571	55609	55566	55566	You	1200	“ . . . I think the solution might be to turn on the romance taps full blast , man . You have to woo her so she sees how different you are from the other loser . ”
55610	55620	55621	55621	he	372	“ Like . . . with candlelight and shit ? ”
55624	55628	55629	55629	Castro	72	“ Maybe jewelry , ”
55632	55637	55629	55629	Castro	72	“ Chicks like bling . ”
55638	55644	55645	55645	Leo	372	“ Not all of them , ”
55649	55674	55645	55645	Leo	372	“ My girl does n’t like jewelry , because it gets in her way when she feels like punishing me on the tennis court . ”
55724	55729	55730	55730	He	72	“ Okay , listen . ”
55735	55738	55739	55741	The younger man	1201	“ Jimbo ! ”
55748	55752	55739	55741	The younger man	1201	“ Whaddaya need ? ”
55753	55765	55739	55741	The younger man	1201	“ Get out the parking tickets . Every player gets one . ”
55766	55771	55772	55772	Castro	72	“ What ? Why ? ”
55775	55827	55772	55772	Castro	72	“ Everyone here owes me an idea . You all have five minutes to write down the best way to romance a woman . If your idea is decent , you do n’t owe anything to the kitty . If your idea is shit , it ’s a twenty dollar fine . ”
55850	55857	55859	55860	everyone else	1202	“ Let ’s just save time . ”
55872	55875	55876	55876	Castro	72	“ Doulie , ”
55879	55897	55876	55876	Castro	72	“ We do n’t know this chick . How are we supposed to guess what she likes ? ”
55898	55906	55907	55907	He	72	“ She ’s , uh . . . ”
55923	55932	55933	55933	He	72	“ Well , she ’s smarter than me . ”
55939	55951	55933	55933	He	72	“ Do n’t say it — that ’s pretty much everyone . ”
55958	55971	55972	55972	Castro	72	“ Okay , she ’s thoughtful . Classy . Not into bling . ”
55977	55994	55972	55972	Castro	72	“ Bummer . It ’s easier when they ’re into bling . Expensive , but easier . ”
56037	56046	56047	56047	Castro	72	“ You have to read ’em out loud , ”
56050	56062	56047	56047	Castro	72	“ We ’re entitled to a little entertainment for our trouble . ”
56063	56069	56070	56070	Jimbo	136	“ I ’ll read ’em , ”
56085	56094	56073	56073	He	136	“ Buy her treats from her favorite bakery . ”
56095	56102	56103	56103	O’Doul	609	“ Not bad , College Boy , ”
56106	56112	56113	56113	Leo	372	“ Always works for me , ”
56133	56136	56137	56137	Jimbo	136	“ Next . ”
56142	56148	56137	56137	Jimbo	136	“ Write her a poem . ”
56149	56157	56158	56158	O’Doul	609	“ Christ , have you met me ? ”
56167	56175	56158	56158	O’Doul	609	“ Crikey puts twenty into the kitty . ”
56197	56207	56208	56210	the other player	1207	“ But you always do okay on karaoke night , ”
56213	56243	56208	56210	the other player	1207	“ And I saw it in a movie once . Chicks dig that shit . Does n’t matter if you do it well . Only that you do it . ”
56250	56259	56260	56260	Castro	72	“ Someone pass me a piece of paper , ”
56263	56280	56260	56260	Castro	72	“ Some of this shit might be useful later . I ’m gon na take notes . ”
56281	56286	56291	56291	Jimbo	136	“ Buy her shoes , ”
56294	56299	56291	56291	Jimbo	136	“ Chicks love shoes . ”
56300	56303	56304	56304	Leo	372	“ No , ”
56307	56330	56304	56304	Leo	372	“ They like shopping for shoes . Would you like it if somebody else picked out your shoes ? I would n’t . ”
56331	56335	56336	56336	O’Doul	609	“ Good point , ”
56358	56361	56349	56349	dudes	1209	“ Next ! ”
56362	56371	56372	56372	Jimbo	136	“ Sully says , Take her ice skating , ”
56376	56387	56388	56388	he	136	“ Gosh , how ever did you think of that ? ”
56395	56422	56388	56388	he	136	“ Dude . Your skating is better than your poetry . And if she ca n’t skate , she ’ll have to hold onto your hands . ”
56423	56426	56468	56468	O’Doul	609	“ Awwwwww ! ”
56455	56460	56443	56443	O’Doul	609	“ Cook her dinner . ”
56461	56467	56468	56468	O’Doul	609	“ Not bad , Massey , ”
56473	56482	56468	56468	O’Doul	609	“ I can do linguini with clam sauce . ”
56522	56533	56534	56534	he	609	“ Those are fine ideas — three months from now , ”
56537	56542	56543	56545	the contributing player	1213	“ Have some patience , ”
56548	56566	56543	56545	the contributing player	1213	“ Not my fault it ’s play - off season . Do n’t take my twenty bucks . ”
56594	56644	56645	56645	Jesus	155	“ Bad idea , man . Seriously dangerous . I got into so much trouble for buying my girl size large once when she was a medium . If you ’re not a hundred percent sure of the size , you might not get any lovin’ for a week . ”
56724	56729	56715	56717	The first one	1217	“ What the fuck ? ”
56730	56733	56734	56734	Castro	72	“ Wait — ”
56740	56747	56748	56748	He	72	“ Who ’s eating whose underwear ? ”
56756	56788	56748	56748	He	72	“ Jimbo — fine Smithy . Okay — last one . Buy her birthstone earrings . Not only are they pretty but it shows that you know when her birthday is . ”
56789	56792	56793	56793	Leo	372	“ Whoa ! ”
56796	56808	56793	56793	Leo	372	“ Sneaky ! I like it . Whose idea was that ? ”
56818	56835	56793	56793	Leo	372	“ There ’s no name . Good idea , though . Anyone want to take credit ? ”
56852	56864	56838	56838	Jimbo	136	“ Christ , kid . How old are you , anyway ? ”
56865	56868	56875	56875	somebody	406	“ Nineteen . ”
56878	56883	56875	56875	somebody	406	“ Jimbo for president ! ”
56884	56887	56888	56888	Castro	72	“ Wait , ”
56896	56911	56888	56888	Castro	72	“ What came right before the underwear ? I might have missed a couple . ”
56920	56944	56888	56888	Castro	72	“ Get your own ideas . It ’s been a pleasure , boys . We ’re watching tape in forty - five minutes . ”
57124	57128	57129	57129	she	376	“ Good afternoon , ”
57133	57146	57129	57129	she	376	“ Afternoon , Ariana . Can I see you for a moment ? ”
57147	57151	57161	57161	she	376	“ Of course . ”
57200	57205	57206	57206	Hugh	72	“ Have a seat , ”
57209	57228	57206	57206	Hugh	72	“ I just got a FedEx for you . It ’s a panic button . Have a look . ”
57229	57235	57239	57239	she	376	“ Oh . Thank you . ”
57296	57312	57313	57313	he	72	“ It ’s well designed , so that you ca n’t trip it by accident , ”
57316	57328	57313	57313	he	72	“ Press the button now — it ’s not activated yet . ”
57329	57332	57333	57333	Ari	376	“ Okay . ”
57349	57362	57313	57313	he	72	“ I see . And I could clip this to my handbag . ”
57363	57372	57379	57379	she	376	“ Exactly . Or your belt at home . ”
57373	57378	57379	57379	she	376	“ Well . . . ”
57384	57404	57405	57405	Hugh	72	“ I ’ll carry it , if you think I should . But it seems like an unnecessary expense . ”
57408	57448	57405	57405	Hugh	72	“ One of my many jobs is buying all kinds of insurance for the team . And I buy a ton of it , always hoping that it ’s a complete waste of money . Welcome to my world . ”
57458	57469	57405	57405	Hugh	72	“ So what happens if I do flip the switch ? ”
57470	57496	57379	57379	she	376	“ Several people will be alerted at once . Law enforcement at the precinct house . Also me , Rebecca — she volunteered . . . ”
57497	57507	57508	57508	Ari	376	“ Wow . Seems like a lot of trouble , ”
57513	57585	57587	57587	his	1233	“ Not as much trouble as if something happened to you . Take it . Wear it . I know it ’s not something you wanted , but we ca n’t have anyone using your position in the Bruisers organization as some kind of nasty leverage . If you push that button there are a few other people who will be notified , including whichever Kattenberger security team is on duty . And”—he
57588	57598	57599	57599	She	376	throat—“Patrick O’Doul . If that ’s okay with you . ”
57606	57613	57599	57599	She	376	“ If he does n’t mind . ”
57614	57618	57619	57619	Hugh	72	“ His idea , ”
57622	57639	57640	57640	Ari	376	“ He lives so close to your house . But it ’s totally up to you . ”
57646	57674	57640	57640	Ari	376	“ Can I speak frankly , sir ? If you would rather I did n’t continue with Mr. O’Doul as my client , I would understand completely . ”
57712	57742	57705	57705	he	376	“ Ari , give me a second while I figure out how to put this in a way that wo n’t have the entire HR department on my ass . ”
57755	57827	57743	57744	The manager	376	“ Okay , it ’s like this . Everyone raves about your work . They even show up for fricking yoga without complaint . I ’m happy . The owner is happy . I do n’t need to change a thing . But if you notify me at any point that you ’re not comfortable treating a player on my team , other arrangements will be made . No questions asked . ”
57828	57834	57835	57835	she	376	“ Thank you , sir , ”
57844	57859	57839	57839	He	376	“ Do you wish to request a transfer of any player to another therapist ? ”
57860	57877	57878	57878	He	376	“ Um , it ’s not necessary to make any changes on my account , sir . ”
57885	57934	57878	57878	He	376	“ Good . Because Henry has been trying to get O’Doul to accept treatment for that hip for weeks . I need that player healthy and in fighting form . Whatever you can do to keep him showing up for therapy , I ’m on board . . . ”
57952	57967	57968	57968	She	376	“ You know , that did n’t come out the way I meant it . ”
57975	57984	57968	57968	She	376	“ I knew what you meant , sir . ”
57985	57988	57989	57989	He	376	“ Fuck . ”
57995	58015	57989	57989	He	376	“ HR hates me already . I just meant that using your professional skill , you ’d . . . ”
58016	58021	58022	58022	she	376	“ I get it , ”
58029	58051	58052	58052	He	376	“ And now if you ’ll excuse me , I have a whole list of players to keep in fighting form . ”
58058	58066	58052	58052	He	376	“ Go forth and conquer muscle soreness . ”
58105	58108	58109	58109	he	376	“ Hi ! ”
58116	58119	58120	58120	she	376	“ Hi , ”
58166	58173	58174	58174	she	376	“ You feeling okay this morning ? ”
58177	58183	58174	58174	she	376	“ How ’s your pain ? ”
58209	58232	58233	58233	She	376	“ I feel like a million bucks , honestly . Skated well this morning . Had a good breakfast . No complaints . ”
58256	58264	58265	58265	he	609	“ Go ahead — do your worst , ”
58269	58274	58265	58265	he	609	“ I ’m ready . ”
58275	58278	58279	58279	she	376	“ Good , ”
58288	58296	58297	58297	he	609	“ Oh — don’t forget the music , ”
58300	58305	58297	58297	he	609	“ Got any Clapton ? ”
58306	58309	58310	58310	She	376	“ Sure . ”
58348	58351	58340	58341	another player	331	“ Wonderful Tonight ”
58387	58394	58395	58395	she	376	“ We only have thirty minutes , ”
58410	58422	58398	58398	They	783	“ So I have to get right to the trouble spots . ”
58423	58430	58431	58431	he	609	“ That ’s fine , sweetheart , ”
58531	58540	58541	58541	she	376	“ Let ’s have you on your side , ”
58545	58552	58553	58553	He	609	“ Let ’s work that hip . ”
58581	58586	58569	58569	he	609	“ Does that hurt ? ”
58587	58590	58591	58591	he	609	“ Nope , ”
58595	58604	58591	58591	he	609	“ Just distracting myself with some hockey stats . ”
58605	58612	58613	58613	He	609	“ Why ? Because of pain ? ”
58616	58637	58613	58613	He	609	“ My body has other reactions to your hands besides pain , sweetheart . Just trying to keep things professional . ”
58638	58648	58655	58655	she	376	“ Ah . Roll onto your stomach for me . ”
58675	58703	58704	58704	He	609	“ Remember when I gave you that speech about how everyone has different reactions to massage ? Some people fall asleep , some people cry . . . ”
58712	58716	58704	58704	He	609	“ Uh huh . ”
58717	58731	58732	58732	His	609	“ There ’s probably a dent in my table from all the boners . ”
58742	58763	58764	58764	She	376	“ Whose ? I ’ll have to kill them now . Shame , too , right before play - offs . ”
58774	58814	58764	58764	She	376	“ Do n’t say that . Sexual response is one of many possible results of muscle relaxation . It only means that the client ’s subconscious trusts me . I pretend not to notice , and life goes on . ”
58815	58832	58833	58833	he	609	“ My subconscious has a little more to go on than the rest of your clients , ”
58841	58869	58870	58870	Patrick	609	“ I know . That ’s why if you wanted to switch to another therapist , Hugh said he ’d make other arrangements . No questions asked . ”
58884	58899	58870	58870	Patrick	609	“ Fuck no . You ’re the only one who gets to touch me . ”
58900	58903	58904	58904	she	376	“ Okay , ”
58919	58935	58870	58870	Patrick	609	“ It was only a suggestion . I was trying to make you more comfortable . ”
58936	58940	58941	58941	he	609	“ Not possible , ”
58944	58958	58959	58959	Surprise	229	“ I only want you , Ari . For this and all things . ”
59053	59059	59060	59060	he	609	“ Thank you , sweetheart , ”
59064	59078	59079	59079	she	376	“ You ’re welcome , as always . See you for yoga later , ”
59453	59462	59463	59463	she	376	“ Hi , honey , I ’m home ! ”
59657	59662	59663	59663	he	609	“ Which cookie place ? ”
59673	59683	59663	59663	he	609	“ One Girl Cookies . That place on Main . ”
59684	59693	59663	59663	he	609	“ What ’s the best thing they have ? ”
59694	59717	59663	59663	he	609	“ Look , Doulie — I have a meeting . All the cookies are great , and the whoopie pies are awesome . ”
59718	59734	59663	59663	he	609	“ Huh . Do n’t know what that is , but I like the name . ”

60198	60204	60205	60205	he	136	“ What ’s the shcore ? ”
60208	60211	60212	60213	the doctor	912	“ Dunno , ”
60216	60225	60226	60226	He	136	“ Does n’t really matter at the moment . ”
60373	60381	60382	60382	he	609	“ I ’ll ice it at home , ”
60440	60443	60431	60431	he	609	“ Jesus , ”
60464	60474	60454	60454	he	609	“ Sorry . Did n’t know it was you . ”
60492	60510	60484	60484	She	376	“ Wow . Only one of us is allowed to be jumpy at a time , okay ? ”
60511	60516	60517	60517	He	609	“ You ’re jumpy ? ”
60521	60526	60527	60527	She	376	“ Is something wrong ? ”
60535	60574	60527	60527	She	376	“ I ’m fine . I thought I saw a certain van in the neighborhood tonight on my way here . I ’m probably just paranoid , but I was going to ask you to walk me home . ”
60575	60581	60582	60582	He	609	“ Of course I will . ”
60589	60601	60582	60582	He	609	“ Did the asshole get served with his restraining order yet ? ”
60602	60630	60527	60527	She	376	“ Nope . They still ca n’t find him . I ’m trying not to feel so paranoid , but the whole situation just creeps me out . ”
60631	60637	60638	60638	he	609	“ You ’re not paranoid , ”
60641	60647	60638	60638	he	609	“ That guy is scum . ”
60742	60747	60748	60748	he	609	“ Let ’s go , ”
60981	60999	61019	61019	he	609	“ Can you take us to the corner of Front and Hudson Ave , pal ? Thanks . ”
61000	61008	61009	61009	Ari	376	“ What ’s wrong with your neck ? ”
61012	61015	61009	61009	Ari	376	“ Nothing . ”
61036	61049	61029	61029	He	609	“ Did you see that mutual ass kicking we gave each other ? ”
61050	61059	61019	61019	he	609	“ I did n’t watch the whole thing . ”
61060	61063	61064	61064	She	376	“ No ? ”
61073	61083	61064	61064	She	376	“ Do n’t like to see anyone hit you . ”
61084	61101	61102	61102	He	609	“ Aw , Ariana ! Careful , sweetheart . I might start thinking you like me . ”
61109	61121	61122	61122	She	376	“ I do like you . Never said I did n’t . ”
61131	61150	61122	61122	She	376	“ But you do n’t want to date me . Guess I did n’t get any prettier tonight . ”
61163	61176	61151	61151	She	376	“ It ’s not you . I ’m not dating . Period . ”
61199	61214	61188	61188	He	609	“ Are you going to come upstairs with me and look after my neck ? ”
61215	61222	61188	61188	He	609	“ Do you need me to ? ”
61223	61226	61227	61227	He	609	“ No . ”
61237	61244	61227	61227	He	609	“ But I want you to . ”
61245	61251	61188	61188	He	609	“ Are n’t you exhausted ? ”
61252	61255	61256	61256	He	609	“ Yeah . ”
61261	61271	61272	61272	She	376	“ Never too tired for your company , though . ”
61284	61287	61272	61272	She	376	“ Okay . ”
61288	61291	61292	61292	He	609	“ Pal . ”
61307	61316	61272	61272	She	376	“ Can you stop at Bridge Street instead ? ”
61317	61321	61272	61272	She	376	“ Sure thing . ”
61344	61356	61332	61332	O’Doul	609	“ If you change your mind I ’ll walk you home . ”
61377	61386	61368	61368	he	609	“ I ’m good . Do n’t worry . ”
61400	61410	61394	61394	Ari	376	“ Who else lives in your building , anyway ? ”
61411	61420	61368	61368	he	609	“ Hugh Major , Coach Worthington . . . ”
61421	61424	61394	61394	Ari	376	“ What ? ”
61425	61449	61394	61394	Ari	376	“ I ’m kidding , yogi . You clearly do n’t want to be seen with a guy who has eight new stitches . ”
61450	61453	61454	61454	she	376	“ Eight ? ”
61466	61500	61457	61457	He	2351	“ Leo and Georgia . Massey . Castro . I think that ’s it right now . This building is convenient as hell . But nobody has as short a commute as you . ”
61501	61511	61512	61512	Ari	376	“ My commute is a New Yorker ’s dream , ”
61515	61570	61571	61571	O’Doul	609	“ When I heard about this job opening up I thought I ’d never get it . Everything about it was too perfect . When Henry called to tell me I could have it if I wanted it , it was really hard not to start squealing like a preteen at her slumber party . ”
61614	61621	61622	61622	he	2351	“ I ’ll get the Scotch , ”
61625	61632	61622	61622	he	2351	“ You ’re in , right ? ”
61633	61636	61637	61637	she	376	“ Sure , ”
61640	61650	61651	61651	He	2351	“ But let me get it . You sit . ”
61654	61666	61651	61651	He	2351	“ I did n’t invite you up to wait on me . ”
61667	61692	61693	61693	She	376	“ God , I know . Just sit down already . My own neck hurts just looking at you . Your gait is off . ”
61705	61712	61693	61693	She	376	“ The Scotch is . . . ”
61713	61718	61719	61719	she	376	“ Over the refrigerator , ”
61739	61746	61747	61747	she	376	“ You have tequila , too , ”
61750	61762	61747	61747	she	376	“ Uh - huh . There are limes in the fridge . ”
61763	61772	61773	61773	she	376	“ How would you feel about a margarita ? ”
61776	61782	61747	61747	she	376	“ I do good work . ”
61783	61788	61789	61789	he	2351	“ I ’m in , ”
61792	61804	61805	61805	He	2351	“ If you ’re mixing it , I ’m drinking it . ”
61884	61908	61873	61873	He	2351	“ Thank you , sweetheart . Are you hungry at all ? I could order something from the twenty - four hour diner . ”
61920	61930	61909	61909	He	2351	“ I ’m good , but you go ahead . ”
61937	61942	61943	61943	He	2351	“ Let ’s sit . ”
61949	61953	61954	61954	Ari	376	“ Hang on . ”
61973	61976	61977	61977	She	376	“ There . ”
62003	62014	61998	61998	She	376	“ Here ’s to the end of a shitty night . ”
62015	62027	62028	62028	He	2351	“ We drink to that a lot , you and me . ”
62035	62038	62039	62039	She	376	“ Truth . ”
62049	62057	62058	62058	She	376	“ Let me work on your neck . ”
62075	62087	62088	62088	He	2351	“ Put your elbows up on the back of the sofa . ”
62098	62111	62088	62088	He	2351	“ This ’s just so you can reach your drink , right ? ”
62112	62115	62116	62116	She	376	“ Exactly . ”
62132	62137	62138	62138	Her	376	“ Okay , incoming . ”
62172	62182	62165	62165	He	2351	“ Come on , O’Doul . Not this again . ”
62183	62186	62187	62187	He	2351	“ Sorry . ”
62190	62198	62187	62187	He	2351	“ I ’ll be a good boy . ”
62214	62225	62226	62226	she	376	“ I know you ca n’t stand having weak spots , ”
62229	62235	62226	62226	she	376	“ Just work with me . ”
62245	62248	62249	62249	he	2351	“ Okay , ”
62362	62371	62372	62372	she	376	“ We ’ll leave it there for now , ”
62434	62438	62421	62421	He	2351	“ Your turn . ”
62439	62442	62443	62443	she	376	“ Mmm , ”
62454	62499	62446	62446	he	2351	“ That is nice . But I did n’t strain anything tonight . Watching hockey is n’t very tiring . And the owner ’s box has these warm Brazilian cheese puffs . I think I ate a dozen of them . . . Mmm . ”
62500	62512	62513	62513	he	2351	“ What ’s it like in the box with Nate Kattenberger ? ”
62539	62638	62529	62529	Ari	376	“ It ’s great . Some nights he gets all quiet and broody , but we can never tell if it ’s the game or if he ’s busy reinventing the Internet in that big brain of his . Tonight he was in a fun mood , joking with Becca and Georgia and taking bets . We only wager pretzels , though . Georgia won the pot by guessing that Leo Trevi would be the first to score . Then she screamed her lungs out when he did . Nate says he ’s deaf in one ear now . ”
62639	62674	62681	62681	Ari	376	“ Sounds like fun . I guess I thought he ’d be all crazy intense up there . He ’s got more money invested in the team than the GDP of a developing nation . ”
62675	62680	62681	62681	Ari	376	“ He is intense , ”
62693	62730	62681	62681	Ari	376	“ About everything . But so are sports fans everywhere . Walk past any sports bar and there are guys screaming at the TV . Do you feel like Nate is more entitled to his intensity ? ”
62731	62741	62742	62742	He	1307	“ Sure he is . He signs my checks . ”
62750	62785	62786	62786	She	376	“ We ’re all just hangin ’ by a thread , babe . It ’s not just you who worries about job security . It ’s every guy on that team . Every day . ”
62801	62811	62812	62812	he	1307	“ What else does Nate do on game night ? ”
62815	62831	62832	62832	Hockey	236	“ Is he superstitious ? Does he carry a rabbit ’s foot or rosary beads ? ”
62880	62929	62930	62930	O’Doul	609	“ Let ’s see . He turns off his phone during the games . Does that count ? He seems like the kind of guy who never unplugs . Oh — and he never has a drink until the third period , and only if we ’re losing . ”
62933	62940	62930	62930	O’Doul	609	“ Bottoms up tonight , then . ”
62941	62961	62962	62962	Ari	376	“ The man can drink , too . And after four Scotches he ’s still sharp as a tack . ”
62965	62973	62974	62974	He	72	“ I ’ve noticed that . Crazy . ”
62980	62991	62974	62974	He	72	“ You ’re beat . Let ’s go to sleep . ”
62992	62995	62996	62996	he	72	“ Sorry , ”
63007	63026	62996	62996	he	72	“ I ’m not a fun host . I ’ll walk you home if you want me to . ”
63027	63036	63037	63037	Ari	376	“ It ’s almost one in the morning , ”
63041	63046	63047	63047	She	376	“ Let ’s crash . ”
63083	63091	63092	63092	She	376	“ Thanks for working out my kinks . ”
63102	63112	63092	63092	She	376	“ Patrick , you are still full of them . ”
63121	63125	63126	63126	he	72	“ Leave those , ”
63137	63158	63126	63126	he	72	“ Borrow anything in the bathroom . There are probably a couple of those airplane toothbrushes in the medicine cabinet . ”
63209	63215	63216	63216	he	72	“ Good night , sweetheart , ”
63371	63376	63363	63363	She	376	“ Morning , sweetheart . ”
63377	63380	63381	63381	she	376	“ Mmm , ”
63430	63435	63436	63436	he	609	“ You sleep okay ? ”
63443	63446	63436	63436	he	609	“ Yeah , ”
63457	63460	63436	63436	he	609	“ You ? ”
63461	63466	63447	63447	she	376	“ Like a brick . ”
63467	63473	63478	63478	he	609	“ How ’s your pain ? ”
63494	63497	63498	63498	she	376	“ Ah , ”
63621	63632	63633	63633	he	609	“ Sure like waking up with you in my bed , ”
63651	63660	63639	63639	He	609	“ Touch yourself while I work your tits . ”
63687	63694	63695	63695	She	376	“ Get yourself ready for me . ”
63736	63739	63740	63740	he	609	“ Fuck , ”
63743	63747	63740	63740	he	609	“ Want you . ”
63748	63752	63753	63753	she	376	“ Have me , ”
63772	63783	63761	63761	her	376	“ But this time we ’re doing it my way . ”
63784	63788	63789	63789	He	609	“ Fair enough . ”
63813	63821	63822	63822	He	609	“ Tell me how you want me . ”
63884	63887	63888	63888	she	376	“ Mmm , ”
63891	63899	63888	63888	she	376	“ Sit up . Against the headboard . ”
64056	64064	64065	64065	she	376	“ We ’re going to go slow , ”
64068	64071	64072	64072	He	839	“ Okay . ”
64075	64083	64072	64072	He	839	“ Slower than you ’ve ever gone . ”
64084	64098	64099	64099	She	376	“ Show me , sweetheart . Wherever you lead , I ’m following . ”
64115	64122	64123	64123	He	839	“ You know what tantric is ? ”
64128	64142	64123	64123	He	839	“ Do n’t know my own name when you ’re on my cock . ”
64143	64149	64150	64150	She	376	“ Think — yoga sex . ”
64163	64168	64169	64169	she	376	“ Look at me , ”
64212	64217	64218	64218	she	376	“ Breathe with me , ”
64221	64227	64218	64218	she	376	“ I ’m breathin ’ . ”
64228	64236	64237	64237	He	839	“ Purposefully . Like in yoga class . ”
64453	64459	64448	64448	His	839	“ You like it slow . ”
64469	64472	64473	64473	she	376	“ Sometimes , ”
64476	64482	64483	64483	He	839	“ I like it all . ”
64490	64498	64499	64499	he	839	“ Go out for dinner with me , ”
64512	64516	64499	64499	he	839	“ Right now ? ”
64517	64520	64521	64521	he	839	“ No , ”
64534	64559	64560	64560	He	839	“ But I want to see more of you , and I figure right now is as good a time as any to ask . ”
64573	64580	64560	64560	He	839	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
64581	64588	64589	64589	He	839	“ She ’ll think about it . ”
64597	64612	64613	64613	He	839	“ What does a guy have to do around here to get a date ? ”
64631	64643	64619	64619	she	376	“ Is it still tantric if I play with your tits ? ”
64759	64767	64768	64768	she	376	“ You ’re very patient with me , ”
64774	64785	64768	64768	she	376	“ But I do n’t want to be patient anymore . ”
64786	64792	64793	64793	he	839	“ Enough of your way ? ”
64799	64802	64793	64793	he	839	“ Yeah . ”
64803	64810	64813	64813	he	839	“ On your back , girlie . ”
65003	65007	65008	65008	he	609	“ I swear , ”
65015	65021	65008	65008	he	609	“ gets better every time . ”
65029	65040	65041	65041	she	376	“ That ’s just because we did it my way , ”
65044	65047	65048	65048	He	609	“ Liar . ”
65058	65071	65072	65072	He	609	“ But I ’ll take you any way I can get you . ”
65077	65084	65085	65085	she	376	“ Are we late for work ? ”
65104	65117	65090	65090	He	609	“ Do n’t think so . It ’s just eight o’clock now . ”
65118	65138	65090	65090	He	609	“ Good . Because I do n’t think I could hurry anywhere right now . How ’s your face ? ”
65139	65143	65144	65144	She	376	“ What face ? ”
65147	65154	65155	65155	His	609	“ Should I ask you later ? ”
65171	65185	65163	65163	He	609	“ I got up earlier and took some ibuprofen . I feel okay . ”
65186	65192	65155	65155	His	609	“ You going to practice ? ”
65193	65208	65163	65163	He	609	“ Yeah , sure . Unless they keep me back for another concussion evaluation . ”
65217	65226	65227	65227	He	609	“ Do you think you have a concussion ? ”
65232	65245	65227	65227	He	609	“ But every time I take a beating they need to check . ”
65246	65258	65259	65259	She	376	“ I do n’t like it when you take a beating . ”
65276	65290	65268	65268	He	609	“ Is that why you wo n’t go out to dinner with me ? ”
65313	65337	65305	65305	she	376	“ I already told you why I ca n’t date . You do n’t really want to start something with me , anyway . ”
65338	65345	65346	65346	She	376	“ Yeah , I really do . ”
65351	65385	65346	65346	She	376	“ The next man who has the pleasure of starting a relationship with me is getting a cynical girl with trust issues and a ticking biological clock . How ’s that for sexy ? ”
65386	65391	65392	65392	he	609	“ Ari . . . ”
65406	65436	65392	65392	he	609	“ in the dictionary under sexy , there ’s a picture of you in the warrior pose . And — hell — nobody has more baggage than I do . ”
65437	65448	65392	65392	he	609	“ Awesome . Then we should definitely become a thing . ”
65449	65461	65462	65462	He	609	“ That ’s what I ’ve been trying to tell you . ”
65485	65498	65475	65475	She	376	“ I ’ll go out to dinner with you on one condition . ”
65499	65502	65475	65475	She	376	“ Anything . ”
65503	65522	65523	65523	He	609	“ You tell me how you started fighting , and why you do n’t like to be touched . ”
65529	65539	65523	65523	He	609	“ Why would you want to hear about that ? ”
65540	65548	65549	65549	He	609	“ Because I ’m interested in you . ”
65560	65576	65549	65549	He	609	“ It ’s not a nice story , Ari . No need to go there . ”
65577	65581	65582	65582	she	376	“ Your call , ”
65590	65600	65582	65582	she	376	“ I ’m going to use your fancy shower . ”
65613	65621	65622	65622	Castro	72	“ March , man . Fucking March . ”
65636	65660	65622	65622	Castro	72	“ It ’s the month that killed Julius Caesar , and every year I think it ’s gon na kill me , too . ”
65661	65667	65668	65668	O’Doul	609	“ Tell me about it , ”
65688	65697	65698	65698	Castro	72	“ Sixteen games in thirty - one days , ”
65709	65713	65698	65698	Castro	72	“ Batter up . ”
65731	65741	65742	65742	He	72	“ You know who are a bunch of pussies ? ”
65756	65759	65748	65748	Castro	72	“ Who ? ”
65770	65775	65776	65776	he	72	“ Football . Players , ”
65800	65806	65807	65807	he	72	“ One game a week , ”
65815	65831	65807	65807	he	72	“ And average time on the field is eleven minutes . You believe that shit ? ”
65832	65839	65840	65840	Castro	72	“ No , I do not , ”
65843	65873	65840	65840	Castro	72	“ Let ’em try to skate forty minutes in a game , three and a half nights a week . They ’d curl up in a little fucking ball . ”
65874	65878	65879	65879	O’Doul	609	“ Your turn , ”
65918	65923	65910	65910	he	72	“ Need a spot ? ”
65924	65929	65934	65934	O’Doul	609	“ I got it . ”
65930	65933	65934	65934	O’Doul	609	“ Okay . ”
65955	65961	65962	65962	He	72	“ How are you today ? ”
65972	65979	65962	65962	He	72	“ Good , sir . You ? ”
65980	65988	65962	65962	He	72	“ Can we talk for a second ? ”
65989	65992	65962	65962	He	72	“ Sure . ”
66058	66067	66068	66068	Nate	72	“ I want to show you this chart , ”
66084	66087	66088	66088	He	72	“ Okay . ”
66104	66111	66088	66088	He	72	“ What am I looking at ? ”
66112	66145	66146	66146	O’Doul	609	“ Ten years of history . Each dot is a team in a given year . They are plotted like this : injury days versus wins . Do you see the pattern ? ”
66216	66231	66205	66205	he	72	“ Okay — yeah . The teams that had more injuries have fewer wins . ”
66232	66276	66205	66205	he	72	“ Exactly . And that ’s just logical , right ? But look how strong that correlation between healthy teams and winning is . Do you think they ’re just smarter — their GMs somehow chose players that do n’t ever get injured ? ”
66277	66280	66281	66281	He	72	“ No . ”
66287	66299	66281	66281	He	72	“ They do n’t have a fucking crystal ball in Dallas . ”
66300	66303	66304	66304	Nate	72	“ Right , ”
66307	66369	66304	66304	Nate	72	“ But they ’ve realized that doing everything under the sun to keep people healthy is going to pay off . That ’s what we ’re going to do , too . I think winning more games is n’t like the sports pundits like to make it . We have the skills . We just need to keep everyone in rotation . ”
66370	66373	66374	66374	Nate	72	“ Okay . ”
66384	66397	66374	66374	Nate	72	“ That ’s why the club needs you to do less fighting . ”
66401	66419	66374	66374	Nate	72	“ That ’s a nice idea . But exactly how do you think I could avoid it ? ”
66420	66426	66427	66427	Nate	72	“ Let Crikey take some , ”
66431	66451	66452	66453	The billionaire	336	“ Coach asked you to , and you pushed back . I ’m asking you to stop pushing back . ”
66480	66524	66474	66474	He	72	“ But are you trying to tell me your fancy stats do n’t apply to Crikey , too ? He has n’t scrapped much up ’ til now . He could fuck up his body immediately . And every player counts , right ? ”
66549	66576	66543	66543	O’Doul	609	“ Every player counts . Of course they do . But he ’s a young kid . If he gets hurt he ’ll bounce back faster . ”
66577	66587	66590	66590	he	609	“ Is there a chart for that , too ? ”
66623	66692	66619	66619	Nate	72	“ Probably . But we do n’t need another chart to know which of you has played almost a thousand NHL games . That ’s you , not Crikey . The next ten games are going to be the most important of the year . We need experience on that ice . Do n’t sacrifice your body over some macho code . Skate more , take fewer punches . ”
66693	66700	66701	66701	O’Doul	609	“ ‘ Some macho code , ’ ”
66704	66719	66701	66701	O’Doul	609	“ Why did you buy a hockey team if you do n’t like fights ? ”
66727	66738	66739	66739	Nate	72	“ Fights are a sideshow , and you know it , ”
66750	66786	66788	66788	he	72	“ If they keep butts filling some of our seats , that ’s their only value to me . The game is so much bigger than fighting . And I know you agree with me . ”
66791	66804	66805	66805	Nate	72	“ In fifteen years , fighting will be gone from the NHL , ”
66808	66857	66805	66805	Nate	72	“ The Canadian juniors teams are already leaning away from it . Concussion research will condemn it . If you step back now , it ’s not a failure . You ’re just trendy . This is Brooklyn . Be a hipster . More yoga . Fewer stitches . ”
66870	66897	66858	66858	He	72	“ Got ta run . You and Coach had better teach Crikey a few things so we can stay in the right corner of that chart . ”
66978	66985	66986	66986	she	376	“ I did n’t order anything , ”
66990	67001	67002	67003	the kid	365	“ If you ’re Ari , these are for you , ”
67006	67010	67002	67003	the kid	365	“ Sign here . ”
67186	67192	67193	67193	she	376	“ I just had one , ”
67199	67220	67221	67221	he	72	“ Come on back for a minute anyway . We have a couple more questions we need to ask you , ”
67224	67228	67221	67221	he	72	“ All right . ”
67247	67263	67264	67264	he	72	“ Were you able to serve your ex - boyfriend with his order of protection ? ”
67273	67291	67268	67268	She	376	“ The process server ca n’t find him . I do n’t know where he ’s staying . ”
67292	67296	67297	67298	The detective	72	“ I see . ”
67307	67327	67297	67298	The detective	72	“ I need to show you a document and ask you if it ’s your signature on the bottom . ”
67328	67331	67332	67332	Her	376	“ Okay ? ”
67389	67395	67396	67396	She	376	“ Does this look familiar ? ”
67437	67446	67431	67431	someone	352	“ Oh my god . What is this ? ”
67447	67459	67434	67435	Ariana Bettini	783	“ That ’s what I was hoping you could tell me . ”
67460	67479	67431	67431	someone	352	“ I certainly do n’t write checks for that amount . And I do n’t know this bank . ”
67480	67484	67485	67486	The detective	72	“ I see . ”
67497	67518	67519	67519	Her	376	“ Would you mind filling this out , please ? In the middle section , sign your name five times . ”
67535	67552	67523	67523	she	376	“ What the hell is going on ? Why are you asking me to do this ? ”
67553	67562	67563	67563	he	72	“ I ca n’t comment on the investigation , ”
67581	67599	67600	67600	He	72	“ There ’s a bank account with my name on it somewhere ? What does that mean ? ”
67628	67639	67617	67617	she	376	“ Hang on — I have a few more questions . ”
67640	67644	67645	67645	she	376	“ Too bad , ”
67655	67673	67674	67675	The cop	982	“ I ’m going home to call my lawyer . You can clear your questions through him . ”
67798	67804	67805	67805	Patrick	609	“ Keep your chin up , ”
67808	67811	67812	67812	They	1352	“ Yeah . ”
67828	67858	67818	67818	They	1352	“ Your reach is better than mine , so stay loose and do n’t let me get near you until you ’re ready to grab the sweater . Ready ? ”
67878	67881	67882	67882	players	2166	“ Yeah ! ”
67885	67890	67891	67891	Nobody	393	“ You got this ! ”
67943	67953	67954	67954	Patrick	609	“ You ’re gettin ’ the hang of it , ”
67960	67967	67954	67954	Patrick	609	“ Dude . What a rush , ”
67974	67988	67968	67968	Crikey	188	“ Where ’d you learn to fight , anyway ? Who taught you ? ”
67989	68009	67968	67968	Crikey	188	“ When I was ten I started hanging out at a boxing gym . You never heard this story ? ”
68010	68022	68023	68023	Patrick	609	“ No . Ten ? Fuck . You ’re a prodigy . ”
68037	68061	68023	68023	Patrick	609	“ Eh . It was necessary . The older kids at the group home where I lived kept stealing my food . . . ”
68066	68109	68062	68062	Ari	376	“ . . . I hung around the boxing gym because I needed to figure out how to shut that shit down . The guys in there thought it was funny that a kid wanted to fight , so they taught me . ”
68110	68113	68114	68114	Crikey	188	“ Jesus . ”
68118	68123	68114	68114	Crikey	188	“ Did it work ? ”
68124	68148	68149	68149	He	609	“ Sure . Eventually . I ’m here now , right ? Did n’t starve . You want to go one more time ? ”
68214	68219	68220	68220	she	376	“ Is . . . ”
68225	68235	68220	68220	she	376	“ Massey ? Are you ready for your appointment ? ”
68427	68430	68413	68413	She	376	“ Hello ? ”
68431	68434	68424	68425	the lawyer	1362	“ Ariana . ”
68453	68459	68445	68445	Vince	351	“ Do n’t hang up . ”
68460	68466	68467	68467	she	376	“ Why should n’t I ? ”
68470	68495	68467	68467	she	376	“ What the hell , Vince . You got yourself mixed up in some bullshit and now the cops want to talk to me . ”
68496	68503	68504	68504	he	1362	“ That will all go away , ”
68508	68520	68467	68467	she	376	“ But you have to do this one thing for me . ”
68521	68530	68467	68467	she	376	“ I do n’t have to do anything . ”
68531	68554	68555	68555	She	376	“ Yeah , you do . It will take you fifteen minutes , and you ’ll never hear from the cops again . ”
68576	68584	68566	68566	she	376	“ What is it ? No promises . ”
68585	68594	68467	68467	she	376	“ I need to get into the house . ”
68595	68609	68566	68566	she	376	“ Why ? I put all your things in the b . . . ”
68610	68637	68638	68638	He	1367	“ Listen to me , girl . If you do n’t want your boyfriend ’s ass hung out to dry . You . Will . Listen . ”
68662	68669	68670	68670	Vince	351	“ We ’ll set a time , ”
68677	68710	68670	68670	Vince	351	“ You ’ll exit from the front door and leave it open behind you . Take a walk around the neighborhood for fifteen minutes . There ’s something I need to retrieve . ”
68718	68723	68670	68670	Vince	351	“ What is it ? ”
68724	68761	68762	68762	She	1368	“ Never you mind . It ’s nothing you can find without my help . And if you touch it , everything turns to shit . I promise you do not want any part in this . ”
68765	68773	68762	68762	She	1368	“ What the hell have you done ? ”
68774	68777	68778	68778	he	351	“ Nothing , ”
68782	68804	68778	68778	he	351	“ And I aim to prove it . You screw this up for me , and your boyfriend will regret it . ”
68805	68824	68762	68762	She	1368	“ Do n’t threaten me . A judge gave me a restraining order with your name on it . ”
68825	68835	68836	68836	he	351	“ Leave it on the coffee table for me , ”
68839	68859	68762	68762	She	1368	“ I need in there . Fifteen minutes . After eight years , you can give me fifteen minutes . ”
68860	68867	68868	68868	she	1368	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
68881	68894	68872	68872	he	351	“ I do n’t have time for you to think about it . ”
68895	68906	68911	68911	she	1368	“ Yeah ? I ’m done being bullied by you . ”
69210	69213	69214	69214	she	1368	“ Hi , ”
69223	69234	69214	69214	she	1368	“ Can I come over ? It ’s an emergency . ”
69235	69241	69242	69242	Becca	372	“ What kind of emergency ? ”
69255	69268	69242	69242	Becca	372	“ The kind that needs a margarita . Not a bail bondsman . ”
69269	69306	69214	69214	she	1368	“ Whew . You had me worried there . It ’s , uh , not that relaxing here . Meet me across the street in the lobby of 220 . We ’ll go to Georgia ’s . ”
69307	69310	69242	69242	Becca	372	“ Okay . ”
69350	69353	69354	69354	Becca	372	“ Hey ! ”
69362	69373	69354	69354	Becca	372	“ Is this latest news going to piss me off ? ”
69374	69377	69378	69378	Becca	372	“ Probably . ”
69386	69400	69378	69378	Becca	372	“ Come on then . You can tell me while we ’re drinking . ”
69421	69430	69431	69431	she	372	“ We ’re going up to . . . ”
69448	69456	69435	69436	the doorman	809	“ Have a nice night , ladies . ”
69457	69464	69465	69465	Becca	372	“ I ’m here a lot , ”
69487	69490	69491	69491	Georgia	1098	“ Hey ! ”
69505	69526	69494	69494	she	372	“ Tequila and a bakery bag ? And Becca has her pedicure satchel ? Oh , crap . Who died ? ”
69527	69535	69536	69536	Becca	372	“ Ari is having a bad day , ”
69539	69553	69554	69554	She	372	“ And my nephew is teething . So we came to your place . ”
69564	69580	69554	69554	She	372	“ March Madness is on , and half the team is here to watch it . ”
69581	69584	69585	69585	Becca	372	“ Fuck , ”
69588	69593	69594	69594	Ari	376	“ Well . . . ”
69622	69632	69633	69633	She	372	“ I have an idea . Come with me . ”
69656	69662	69643	69643	He	609	“ Ladies ? Everything okay ? ”
69663	69676	69677	69677	Becca	372	“ No , but Ari has n’t given us the update yet , ”
69684	69698	69677	69677	Becca	372	“ We need your apartment . You can go watch basketball with Leo . ”
69711	69741	69742	69742	His	609	“ If you were going to stay in tonight , I can drag the girls back to my place . But I did n’t want to be alone there . ”
69746	69752	69742	69742	His	609	“ Dare I ask why ? ”
69753	69761	69762	69762	Becca	372	“ Do n’t tell him before us , ”
69769	69787	69762	69762	Becca	372	“ Doulie , do you have martini glasses ? Hey — you do ! I ’m astonished . ”
69818	69846	69803	69803	Becca	372	“ Okay , Ari . Do your magic . I ’ll open the tequila . You bought the big bottle . Damn . Is it that bad ? ”
69847	69853	69854	69854	she	372	“ It ’s pretty bad , ”
69857	69866	69854	69854	she	372	“ Can you check the fridge for limes ? ”
69867	69873	69874	69874	Georgia	1098	“ I ’ll do it , ”
69923	69927	69928	69928	Georgia	1098	“ Found one ! ”
69931	69934	69928	69928	Georgia	1098	“ Knife ? ”
69944	69948	69935	69935	Becca	372	“ Cutting board ? ”
69949	69956	69957	69957	Becca	372	“ Men never have cutting boards , ”
69960	69964	69965	69965	Patrick	609	“ Not true ! ”
69971	69975	69965	69965	Patrick	609	“ No way , ”
69992	70006	69982	69982	she	372	“ After Patrick leaves we ’re going to discuss his ridiculously civilized apartment . ”
70007	70014	69982	69982	she	372	“ Who says I ’m leaving ? ”
70015	70020	70021	70021	Becca	372	“ You can stay , ”
70024	70037	70021	70021	Becca	372	“ But everyone who stays is having his or her toenails painted . ”
70038	70041	70042	70042	he	609	“ Hmm , ”
70045	70053	70021	70021	Becca	372	“ That ’s not really my scene . ”
70054	70057	70058	70058	Becca	372	“ Exactly , ”
70061	70074	70075	70075	Patrick	609	“ You ’d better have four glasses out over there , though , ”
70078	70090	70075	70075	Patrick	609	“ I ’m not leaving until someone gives me a margarita . ”
70091	70095	70096	70096	Becca	372	“ Fair enough , ”
70107	70124	70096	70096	Becca	372	“ I guess you can have a drink , since we invaded your home and everything . ”
70125	70129	70130	70130	he	609	“ She guesses , ”
70178	70186	70161	70161	She	376	“ You are very patient with us . ”
70187	70195	70196	70196	he	609	“ You are very amusing to me , ”
70230	70259	70222	70222	She	376	“ Okay , kids . Drink up . Because I need you all nice and loose to help me guess what my douchewhistle ex has done this time . ”
70323	70339	70340	70340	Patrick	609	“ Then I just had to get out of there . Now I feel watched . ”
70379	70393	70367	70367	he	609	“ Sweetheart . Do n’t leave here before I get back , promise ? ”
70406	70412	70394	70394	He	609	“ Where are you going ? ”
70413	70430	70431	70431	He	609	“ Basketball down the hall . ‘ Cause my nails are fine the way they are . ”
70448	70458	70394	70394	He	609	“ Just do n’t go home alone , please . ”
70459	70462	70463	70463	she	376	“ Okay , ”
70512	70520	70495	70495	Georgia	1098	“ Omigod . You need to spill . ”
70521	70526	70527	70527	Georgia	1098	“ I just did . ”
70532	70562	70527	70527	Georgia	1098	“ No , honey . Not about your ex . About Doulie . You told me — and this is a direct quote — it ’s not like that . ”
70563	70580	70495	70495	Georgia	1098	“ Well , it ’s sort of like that now . I assumed Becca told you . ”
70581	70587	70588	70588	Becca	372	“ I am a vault , ”
70591	70601	70588	70588	Becca	372	“ You told me to keep my trap shut . ”
70602	70608	70609	70609	Ari	376	“ And I thank you , ”
70613	70623	70609	70609	Ari	376	“ I do n’t want the team to know . ”
70624	70632	70633	70633	Georgia	1098	“ I wo n’t tell a soul , ”
70636	70659	70660	70660	Georgia	1098	“ Not even Leo . But I do n’t know why you ’re so worried . The team is nice to me , ”
70664	70675	70660	70660	Georgia	1098	“ Hell , I think they like me better now . ”
70676	70688	70689	70689	Ari	376	“ But you do n’t touch their naked bodies every day . ”
70712	70727	70728	70728	Becca	372	“ I do n’t want anyone imagining sex with me on the massage table . ”
70740	70766	70728	70728	Becca	372	“ I hear where you ’re coming from . But maybe you should give massage table sex a try with Doulie . That sounds extraordinary . ”
70767	70771	70772	70772	Ari	376	“ It was , ”
70782	70794	70772	70772	Ari	376	“ But we did n’t do it at work . God . ”
70795	70798	70799	70799	Georgia	1098	“ God , ”
70820	70832	70815	70815	Becca	372	“ Wait . What did you get up to at work ? ”
70833	70842	70843	70843	Georgia	1098	“ I did n’t mean it to happen , ”
70853	70870	70843	70843	Georgia	1098	“ But Leo came to find me in my office one day last week . . . ”
70871	70874	70875	70875	Becca	372	“ And ? ”
70886	70902	70878	70878	Georgia	1098	“ He discovered that my office door locks . We did it on my desk . ”
70903	70906	70907	70907	Becca	372	“ Omigod . ”
70925	70936	70915	70915	Patrick	609	“ I ’ll never eat donuts on your desk again . ”
70937	70943	70944	70944	Georgia	1098	“ We were very tidy , ”
70951	70974	70944	70944	Georgia	1098	“ And anyway , we ’re getting off the topic . Is Doulie a good boyfriend ? I ’ll bet he is . ”
70975	70982	70983	70983	Ari	376	“ He ’s not my boyfriend , ”
70986	71008	70983	70983	Ari	376	“ I ca n’t have one of those right now . I think I need to remember how to be alone . ”
71009	71013	71014	71014	Becca	372	“ I remember ! ”
71021	71040	71014	71014	Becca	372	“ And it blows . So forgive me if I do n’t think your argument holds any water . ”
71041	71086	70983	70983	Ari	376	“ Even if I wanted to date someone right now , I do n’t think we ’re a good fit . I always fall for the bossy macho men , and then I ca n’t figure out why they want to control my life . ”
71087	71091	71092	71092	Georgia	1098	“ Hang on , ”
71108	71127	71128	71128	Ari	376	“ Macho can take many forms . They are n’t all bad . Does Doulie push you around ? ”
71133	71140	71128	71128	Ari	376	“ He ’s bossy , though . ”
71153	71189	71190	71190	She	372	“ Ugh . He should n’t press me for a relationship , anyway . I ’m a freaking wreck . My ex is trying to break into my home , and even worse . . . ”
71203	71213	71214	71214	Becca	372	“ What could be worse than a violent ex ? ”
71217	71233	71214	71214	Becca	372	“ I mean , seriously . You ’ve got no place to go but up . ”
71234	71237	71238	71238	Georgia	1098	“ Bec ! ”
71241	71246	71247	71247	Mine	372	“ Everyone makes mistakes . ”
71253	71263	71264	71264	she	372	“ I ca n’t afford to make another mistake , ”
71267	71286	71264	71264	she	372	“ Because I want a child . And Patrick told me once that he ’s never having kids . ”
71350	71379	71345	71345	Georgia	1098	“ Maybe it ’s time to move on to the nail - painting portion of the evening . Before we ’re too drunk to do a good job . ”
71380	71384	71385	71385	Becca	372	“ Good call . ”
71392	71400	71401	71401	She	372	“ I ’ll set up the footbath . ”
71411	71423	71424	71424	Georgia	1098	“ Let ’s pull the coffee table out of the way , ”
71427	71434	71424	71424	Georgia	1098	“ We need the whole rug . ”
71448	71456	71442	71442	Ari	376	“ Hey — I have baked goodies . ”
71457	71460	71461	71461	Becca	372	“ Yesss ! ”
71464	71476	71461	71461	Becca	372	“ Let me guess — whoopie pies from One Girl Cookies ? ”
71477	71483	71484	71484	Becca	372	“ How did you know ? ”
71490	71497	71484	71484	Becca	372	“ I may have been consulted . ”
71498	71503	71504	71504	Ari	376	“ You helped him ? ”
71507	71512	71513	71513	Becca	372	“ Who would n’t ? ”
71530	71550	71513	71513	Becca	372	“ He ’s adorable . You know — in a really rugged , panty - ripping kind of way . ”
71559	71590	71551	71551	Georgia	1098	“ Take off your shoes , Ari . You ’re going first . Becca ’s theory is that everyone thinks better with her feet in a tub of warm water . ”
71609	71626	71596	71596	She	376	“ Oh — and Becca likes to choose the polish . She ’s bossy like that . ”
71627	71634	71635	71635	Becca	372	“ Only for you , sweetie , ”
71659	71671	71596	71596	She	376	“ Because you are n’t vain enough to get it right . ”
71672	71677	71678	71678	Georgia	1098	“ Well , damn , ”
71681	71721	71722	71722	Ari	376	“ Just for that I ’m going to warn Ari that you screw with the travel reservations sometimes . Do n’t be too shocked if Doulie ends up in the adjoining room when you go to Ottawa tomorrow morning . ”
71734	71737	71738	71738	she	376	“ Omigod ! ”
71753	71761	71738	71738	she	376	“ That was your doing in Raleigh ? ”
71773	71778	71762	71762	Becca	372	“ Did it work ? ”
71779	71789	71790	71790	Ari	376	“ Good lord . Hottest night of my life , ”
71817	71822	71823	71823	Becca	372	“ You ’re blushing , ”
71827	71833	71823	71823	Becca	372	“ You would , too . ”
71838	71854	71823	71823	Becca	372	“ Always the wingman , never the target . Somebody better make me another margarita . ”
71855	71861	71862	71862	Georgia	1098	“ I ’m on it , ”
71874	71893	71865	71865	Ari	376	“ We still have to figure out what Vince left in my apartment . What could it be ? ”
71894	71900	71901	71901	Becca	372	“ His heart , honey , ”
71905	71926	71927	71927	Ari	376	“ I think he ’s just jealous . Sometimes men do n’t know what they have until it ’s gone . ”
71934	71964	71927	71927	Ari	376	“ That ’s a nice idea , but I think he ’s serious . I ’m going to have to go to the police again , are n’t I ? ”
71965	71968	71969	71969	Becca	372	“ Probably , ”
71972	71996	71969	71969	Becca	372	“ I ’ll go with you if you want . But tomorrow we ’re going to Ottawa , so you have a reprieve . ”
71997	72004	72005	72005	Georgia	1098	“ And your drink is ready ! ”
72061	72071	72072	72072	Castro	72	“ This is our captain on his night off , ”
72075	72087	72072	72072	Castro	72	“ He probably wears a silk smoking jacket around the house . ”
72088	72095	72096	72097	Zac Sullivan	133	“ What ’s a smoking jacket ? ”
72100	72106	72096	72097	Zac Sullivan	133	“ Maybe I need one . ”
72195	72200	72201	72201	he	72	“ Who ’s winning ? ”
72206	72209	72210	72210	someone	352	“ Louisville , ”
72216	72225	72210	72210	someone	352	“ We ’re all losing our bets tonight . ”
72226	72234	72235	72235	O’Doul	609	“ You ca n’t all be losing , ”
72239	72247	72235	72235	O’Doul	609	“ Who has Louisville in the bracket ? ”
72248	72252	72253	72253	Castro	72	“ The kitty ! ”
72256	72307	72308	72308	Hysterical	231	“ The charity kitty has Louisville . I think Jimbo put that in , the little smartass . It sucks because the winner is supposed to buy us drinks after the Final Four ! You ’ll never let us dip into the kitty for drink money . I know this . ”
72310	72334	72308	72308	Hysterical	231	“ Buy your own damn drinks , asshole . You ’re pullin ’ down more money than most people can make in years . ”
72335	72344	72345	72345	Castro	72	“ It ’s the principle of the thing , ”
72357	72366	72367	72367	O’Doul	609	“ The principle of the thing , huh ? ”
72370	72383	72367	72367	O’Doul	609	“ Put twenty bucks into the kitty just for being a boob . ”
72384	72387	72388	72388	He	72	“ Fuck . ”
72394	72400	72388	72388	He	72	“ Who do I pay ? ”
72401	72410	72367	72367	O’Doul	609	“ I ’ll tell Jimbo you owe him . ”
72411	72420	72421	72421	Beringer	2020	“ What ’s in your glass , captain ? ”
72424	72431	72421	72421	Beringer	2020	“ Does n’t look like Scotch . ”
72432	72442	72388	72388	He	72	“ Maybe a lady friend made it for me . ”
72448	72451	72485	72485	O’Doul	609	“ whoa ! ”
72457	72467	72468	72468	Leo	372	“ So it ’s all working out for you ? ”
72471	72480	72468	72468	Leo	372	“ Do we ever get to meet her ? ”
72481	72484	72485	72485	O’Doul	609	“ Dunno , ”
72536	72551	72522	72522	he	72	“ Your bakery thing was a hit . They even delivered it for me . ”
72552	72561	72562	72562	Leo	372	“ Never underestimate the power of baked goods , ”
72570	72581	72582	72582	he	372	“ My next ploy will be Jimbo ’s birthstone thing , ”
72589	72608	72582	72582	he	372	“ Found something , but it took a while . There is some fugly jewelry in the world . ”
72609	72620	72621	72621	Castro	72	“ Next time , ask a chick where to shop , ”
72624	72656	72659	72659	Christ	138	“ Who has nice taste ? Georgia , of course , but she does n’t seem like a shopper . Rebecca , maybe . Or — I know — ask Ari . ”
72661	72667	72668	72668	Leo	372	“ Or how about Lauren ? ”
72671	72679	72668	72668	Leo	372	“ She ’s always dressed to kill . ”
72680	72690	72691	72691	Castro	72	“ With Lauren , that ’s not a metaphor , ”
72694	72719	72691	72691	Castro	72	“ Say the wrong thing to that chick and she ’ll cut your balls right off . No sense of humor on that girl . ”
72746	72749	72750	72750	O’Doul	609	“ Hey , ”
72766	72774	72750	72750	O’Doul	609	“ Castro , I need that ottoman . ”
72775	72782	72750	72750	O’Doul	609	“ My feet need this ottoman . ”
72783	72800	72801	72801	Castro	72	“ It ’s either that or we ’re snuggling together on your part of the couch . ”
72812	72828	72801	72801	Castro	72	“ Take it . I do n’t want a love triangle with your lady friend . ”
72829	72834	72835	72835	He	72	“ What a gentleman . ”
72869	72874	72875	72875	Georgia	1098	“ That is bullshit , ”
72878	72889	72875	72875	Georgia	1098	“ Matt Damon is so much hotter than Ben Affleck . ”
72890	72901	72902	72902	Ariana	783	“ He ca n’t pull off a beard , though , ”
72905	72909	72902	72902	Ariana	783	“ Admit it . ”
72910	72915	72916	72916	Becca	372	“ Or a ponytail , ”
72931	72939	72919	72919	He	72	“ Hi , ladies . Miss me ? ”
73006	73009	73010	73010	Ari	376	“ Hey . ”
73015	73018	73019	73019	She	376	“ Whoa . ”
73032	73042	73019	73019	She	376	“ Wow . We had a lot of tequila . ”
73043	73046	73047	73047	Becca	372	“ Indeed ! ”
73053	73066	73047	73047	Becca	372	“ Ran out of margarita mix . Had to do some shots . ”
73078	73085	73047	73047	Becca	372	“ And how ’d that go ? ”
73086	73090	73091	73091	Georgia	1098	“ Pretty good ! ”
73097	73109	73091	73091	Georgia	1098	“ But I ca n’t really feel my face right now . ”
73110	73115	73116	73116	he	609	“ Is that right ? ”
73136	73153	73154	73154	She	376	“ I think I can get up by myself . Let ’s give it a try . ”
73165	73172	73154	73154	She	376	“ So far , so good . ”
73194	73210	73182	73182	She	376	“ Come on , babe . Let ’s pour you back into your own apartment . ”
73211	73214	73215	73215	Georgia	1098	“ M’kay . ”
73221	73236	73237	73237	Becca	372	“ Come over here and hold onto the door while I get my stuff , ”
73247	73254	73237	73237	Becca	372	“ I can walk her home , ”
73258	73264	73237	73237	Becca	372	“ And you , too . ”
73265	73270	73271	73271	Becca	372	“ We ’re fine ! ”
73286	73289	73275	73275	She	376	“ Whoops ! ”
73290	73299	73300	73300	Ari	376	“ Do n’t worry about the . . . ”
73317	73322	73300	73300	Ari	376	“ I got those . ”
73385	73390	73391	73391	she	372	“ I ’m drunk , ”
73400	73410	73391	73391	she	372	“ I know , baby . It ’s okay . ”
73411	73422	73391	73391	she	372	“ I ’ve had more drinks this month than in the last”—she
73425	73427	73391	73391	she	372	hiccup—“year . ”
73428	73433	73434	73434	he	609	“ Is that bad ? ”
73447	73459	73391	73391	she	372	“ Maybe ? I think my chakras are out of alignment . ”
73460	73468	73469	73469	he	609	“ You can work on that tomorrow , ”
73472	73480	73469	73469	he	609	“ Let ’s put you to bed . ”
73481	73501	73502	73502	He	609	“ I brought a toothbrush in my purse . I thought I was going to crash at Becca ’s . ”
73538	73544	73545	73545	she	372	“ I can do this , ”
73552	73563	73564	73564	She	372	“ Please do n’t fall down and hit your head . ”
73571	73582	73583	73583	Women	1199	“ You do sometimes . They pay you for it . ”
73594	73614	73585	73585	They	1199	“ Just humor me and stay vertical . I ’ll find you a T - shirt to sleep in . ”
73636	73639	73640	73640	he	609	“ Here , ”
73653	73667	73640	73640	he	609	“ Do you think you could take this ? How ’s your stomach ? ”
73668	73671	73672	73672	she	372	“ Fine , ”
73675	73679	73680	73680	She	372	“ Thank you . ”
73695	73702	73703	73703	he	609	“ Let ’s get this off , ”
73713	73716	73717	73717	she	372	“ Mmm , ”
73755	73760	73761	73761	he	609	“ There you go , ”
73769	73774	73761	73761	he	609	“ Hop in there . ”
73802	73807	73790	73790	He	609	“ Come to bed ? ”
73808	73814	73815	73815	He	609	“ In a few minutes . ”
73898	73904	73905	73905	she	372	“ The room is spinning , ”
73908	73913	73914	73914	he	609	“ I got you , ”
73932	73941	73942	73942	she	372	“ Not supposed to like you so much , ”
73945	73950	73951	73951	he	609	“ Uh - huh , ”
73954	73966	73951	73951	he	609	“ Tough luck , because I ’d be an awesome date . ”
73967	73971	73972	73972	she	372	“ So humble , ”
73980	73991	73992	73992	She	372	“ Thanks for letting us get sloppy on your parket . ”
73996	74001	73992	73992	She	372	“ I mean carpet . ”
74002	74007	74008	74008	He	609	“ Totally worth it . ”
74022	74033	74008	74008	He	609	“ You girls are very entertaining when you ’re drunk . ”
74034	74043	74044	74044	she	372	“ Do n’t know why you like me , ”
74047	74057	74044	74044	she	372	“ I ’m a pain in the gluteus maximus . ”
74100	74107	74108	74108	he	609	“ You ’re not so bad , ”
74115	74133	74108	74108	he	609	“ It was not a good day . I have to hire the lawyer for more hours . ”
74134	74141	74108	74108	he	609	“ I ’m sorry , baby . ”
74142	74161	74162	74162	He	609	“ I should have become a lawyer . Two hours of private massage equals one hour of lawyering . ”
74167	74184	74186	74186	he	609	“ But then you ’d only live half as long because lawyering sounds boring as shit . ”
74202	74213	74199	74199	She	372	“ I do n’t know if lawyering is a word . ”
74214	74226	74227	74227	Ari	376	“ It is when you ’ve drunk a lot of tequila . ”
74254	74266	74250	74250	she	372	“ I heard you telling Crikey how you learned to fight . ”
74276	74286	74250	74250	she	372	“ Yeah . It was a long time ago . ”
74287	74293	74294	74294	He	609	“ Where were your parents ? ”
74315	74336	74339	74339	She	372	“ Just tell me , Patrick . You want me to trust you , but everything is on your terms . ”
74350	74394	74339	74339	She	372	“ You know , you ’re the only one who calls me Patrick since my mother died . Since you want to know so bad , I was eight when it happened . I watched my father shoot my mother in the head . ”
74395	74400	74401	74401	Ari	376	“ Oh my god . ”
74446	74554	74426	74426	He	1430	“ Obviously my father went to prison . I went into the state ’s care . For a couple of years they found foster homes for me . But foster parents are usually people without a lot of stability , too . When I was ten they sent me to a group home , and it was a disaster . I was the youngest kid there . Never got enough to eat because the teenagers would take my food , my school supplies . Once they sold my shoes to buy beer . I started trying to fight back but they outweighed me by a hundred pounds . ”
74602	74743	74751	74751	Ari	376	“ That ’s when I found that boxing gym in the neighborhood . I passed it every day after school . I started staring into the window watching these guys train . And I was just a kid who had nothing to lose , so I started imitating them — right there on the sidewalk . I ’d shadowbox in front of the plateglass window . They must have thought it was hysterical . So after this goes on for a while the owner invites me inside . His name is Rick , and he ’s got tattoos covering like ninety percent of his body . I thought he was so big and scary and so badass . I wanted to be just like him so I could scare the shit out of the guys who keep taking my stuff . ”
74765	74847	74756	74756	her	376	“ ‘ What are you doing , kid ? ’ they asked me . ‘ Do you have to train for a fight ? ’ So I told them yes . And Rick asked , ‘ When ’s your fight , kid ? ’ And I said , ‘ Every morning at breakfast and every night at dinner , but lunches are at school and the big kids ca n’t steal my lunch except for Saturday and Sunday . . . ’ ”
74872	74909	74910	74910	Ari	376	“ . . . So , anyway , Rick put some protective gear on me and let me kick off my shoes and get into the ring . And I just about pissed myself with glee . ”
74919	75052	75053	75053	He	1434	“ Those guys taught me to fight for real . How to punch , and how to keep my head up , and how to move . I went there every day and they did n’t kick me out . I did n’t always get time in the ring , but there were bags to hit , and people standing around to tell me what to do . And then I decided I ’d learned a lot , right ? So one night when this high school kid decided he was going to eat my piece of meatloaf I socked him right in the eye . He still weighed twice as much as I did , so he picked me up and threw me into the bookcase face - first . . . ”
75059	75133	75053	75053	He	1434	“ I had bruises all over my face and a broken tooth . When I went to the gym the next day , the guys were so fucking mad . They wanted me to tell them who did it , but I was afraid to rat the guy out . So they started teaching me to fight dirty . How to stomp on feet and pull ears and knee somebody in the nuts . “
75292	75298	75282	75282	they	2036	” He cleared his throat . “
75309	75345	75282	75282	they	2036	” He waited for her to say something . But maybe it would be better if she did n’t . If she fell asleep right now , she might not even remember this conversation tomorrow . “
75359	75364	75353	75353	I	327	” Ari said quietly . “
75376	75377	75353	75353	I	327	” “
75380	75384	75353	75353	I	327	” he admitted . “
75442	75460	75434	75435	Every kid	1446	” She slid a hand clumsily up his chest , onto his neck , cupping his jaw . “
75481	75492	75498	75498	baby	120	” That awkward endorsement made him grin into the darkness . “
75507	75508	75509	75509	We	1447	” “
75513	75514	75515	75515	You	120	” “
75523	75536	75521	75521	Ariana	783	” He removed her hand from his face and kissed her palm . “
75563	75622	75561	75561	me	327	” She did n’t , though . Ari had finally fallen to sleep . TWENTY - TWO FRIDAY , MARCH 25TH Standings : 4th Place 10 Regular Season Games Remaining The next morning had a rough start . Ari had woken up in Patrick ’s bed with a pounding headache and a mouth the texture of old burlap . “
75628	75636	75561	75561	me	327	” she ’d moaned into his pillow . “
75648	75677	75678	75678	I	327	” Later , at the rink , she gave massages to four players , including Patrick . He grinned at her every time she gave a little groan . “
75684	75691	75692	75692	You	120	” she said more than once . “
75701	75798	75692	75692	You	120	” he insisted . The liar . Then it was time for a quick stop at home to pack for their overnight to Ottawa . She gave her house what was sadly a familiarly critical inspection when she went inside . But nothing was out of place . There was no sign of Vince , or of trouble . She threw some things into a bag and carried her portable massage table to Water Street , meeting Georgia , Leo , and the limo they ’d hired to take all three of them to the airport . “
75804	75816	75817	75817	Mine	1448	” Georgia asked as they slung their bags into the trunk . “
75822	75823	75817	75817	Mine	1448	” “
75828	75832	75824	75824	We	1449	” Ari agreed . “
75843	75860	75863	75863	he	1450	” she whispered , mindful of Leo , who had his phone pressed to his ear . “
75867	75868	75869	75870	His mom	1451	” “
75888	75889	75882	75882	we	1449	” “
75903	75904	75905	75905	Me	327	” “
75908	75921	75905	75905	Me	327	” Georgia said , sliding onto the stretch limo ’s leather seat . “
75947	75953	75942	75942	Leo	372	” Ari patted the seat . “
75970	75971	75964	75964	I	327	” “
75984	75992	75993	75993	Ari	376	” Leo asked , stashing his phone . “
75999	76003	75993	75993	Ari	376	” Georgia explained . “
76012	76049	76008	76008	We	2688	” Becca said , leaping into the car . She tossed her bag at their feet and slammed the car door . Leo rapped a knuckle against the driver ’s window , and it slid down . “
76057	76061	76064	76064	sir	327	” he said . “
76066	76098	76064	76064	sir	327	” The big car glided away from the curb , and Ari pulled out her water bottle , willing herself to feel better . Flying with a hangover sounded pretty miserable . “
76104	76109	76101	76101	your	327	” she asked Becca . “
76115	76124	76127	76127	her	1454	” Georgia gave her friend a feeble smile . “
76154	76161	76162	76162	Nate	72	” Becca blew out a breath . “
76272	76273	76267	76267	I	327	” “
76278	76282	76283	76283	I	327	” Ari asked . “
76298	76299	76285	76286	Queen Lauren	128	” “
76309	76313	76314	76314	She	128	” Georgia asked . “
76321	76322	76323	76323	I	327	” “
76395	76396	76388	76388	she	128	” “
76401	76405	76406	76406	She	128	” Georgia squeaked . “
76424	76425	76419	76419	she	128	” “
76431	76444	76445	76445	She	128	” Becca shook her head and the stud in her eyebrow flashed . “
76476	76477	76468	76468	her	128	” “
76482	76486	76468	76468	her	128	” Georgia asked . “
76504	76505	76491	76491	she	128	” “
76508	76512	76513	76513	Lauren	128	” Becca sang . “
76527	76542	76513	76513	Lauren	128	” For a couple of seconds , Ari and Georgia just stared at her . “
76545	76554	76513	76513	Lauren	128	” Georgia ’s voice had a hushed tone . “
76566	76567	76568	76568	I	327	” “
76585	76591	76578	76578	They	1471	” Georgia cleared her throat . “
76622	76623	76646	76646	she	128	” “
76671	76672	76664	76664	Lauren	128	” “
76675	76679	76664	76664	Lauren	128	” Georgia said . “
76682	76683	76684	76684	I	327	” “
76722	76729	76730	76730	Nate	72	” Leo shifted in his seat . “
76742	76755	76758	76758	I	327	” He thumped his head back against the wall of the car . “
76779	76780	76771	76771	I	327	” “
76790	76795	76781	76781	Dad	252	” Georgia pointed out . “
76801	76802	76805	76805	you	327	” “
76807	76811	76805	76805	you	327	” Becca said . “
76833	76834	76835	76835	Nate	72	” “
76841	76845	76846	76846	I	327	” Georgia said . “
76871	76872	76873	76873	He	1397	” “
76879	76883	76873	76873	He	1397	” Becca agreed . “
76967	76985	76992	76992	Bec	245	” Ari rubbed her temple , wishing she had the godlike ability to make a headache disappear . “
77003	77004	76992	76992	Bec	245	” “
77013	77017	77018	77018	I	327	” she sighed . “
77028	77092	77095	77095	Ari	376	” Could n’t we all , Ari agreed privately . Maybe when her head stopped aching she would look at her schedule and try to find a sliver of time for some moonlighting . * * * They got to the airport in plenty of time . Some of the players were already gathered in the little waiting area in the charter terminal . “
77097	77103	77095	77095	Ari	376	” Patrick waved at her . “
77108	77136	77139	77139	Patrick	609	” It was a friendly greeting , but not overly familiar . He was respectful of her need to appear professional , and she really appreciated it . “
77141	77145	77139	77139	Patrick	609	” she replied . “
77163	77169	77139	77139	Patrick	609	” His blue eyes twinkled . “
77181	77182	77183	77183	I	327	” “
77192	77198	77187	77187	I	327	” He patted his pocket . “
77208	77209	77203	77203	I	327	” “
77216	77220	77210	77210	I	327	” she said . “
77243	77244	77235	77235	I	327	” “
77248	77332	77235	77235	I	327	” She made a trip to the ladies ’ room where she took an Advil and splashed water on her face . Tequila is not the answer , she told the tired - looking woman in the mirror . Maybe she ’d get some sleep on this flight . That would n’t hurt . When she came back they ’d begun to board the plane . Patrick bent over and picked up her bag off the floor , tucking it over her shoulder . “
77336	77340	77235	77235	I	327	” he asked . “
77346	77408	77235	77235	I	327	” She gave him a wink . As she boarded the jet , she felt his warm gaze on her back . The man was tempting . That was for damned sure . Georgia waved her into a seat in the middle of the plane . Across the aisle , Castro and Becca were sitting together , laughing about something already . “
77418	77422	77409	77409	You	253	” Becca insisted . “
77452	77453	77447	77447	I	327	” “
77460	77461	77447	77447	I	327	” “
77468	77474	77475	77475	Everyone	364	” Castro rolled his eyes . “
77486	77487	77480	77480	I	327	” “
77496	77497	77480	77480	I	327	” “
77505	77511	77500	77500	I	327	” He cleared his throat . “
77534	77535	77529	77529	Rebecca	372	” “
77540	77546	77538	77538	lordy	254	” she said , laughing . “
77610	77621	77624	77625	my lady	120	” He took Becca ’s face in his two hands . “
77634	77635	77627	77627	O	255	” “
77638	77642	77627	77627	O	255	” Becca breathed . “
77655	77656	77661	77661	baby	120	” “
77663	77664	77665	77665	Rebecca	372	” “
77667	77695	77665	77665	Rebecca	372	” a stern voice cut through the silliness . All eyes lifted to find Nathan , messenger bag slung over his shoulder , eyes narrowed in irritation . “
77698	77742	77665	77665	Rebecca	372	” she squeaked , pulling her face out of Castro ’s hands . Her cheeks were tinged with pink , probably because Nathan ’s tone was so scolding . He stared at her another moment , raising the awkwardness quotient into the stratosphere . “
77764	77773	77774	77774	Yikes	146	” Then , finally , he moved away . “
77776	77783	77774	77774	Yikes	146	” Georgia said under her breath . “
77792	78082	77787	77787	his	1491	” Castro whispered . Ari could n’t help but turn around in her seat to watch him stomp down the aisle toward the back of the jet . Her gaze snagged on Patrick , who was also watching the big boss storm away from the awkward little fit he ’d thrown . When Patrick turned his chin , their eyes locked . Ouch , said his gaze . You see why I worry ? hers replied . The flight attendant began to make security announcements . So Ari buckled her seatbelt and pulled her phone out of its pocket to shut it off . She ’d avoided looking at it all day . Seventeen . That ’s how many text messages Vince had sent , asking her to call him . And that was n’t counting the voice mails and the missed calls . Jesus . She shut the phone off , knowing that she really ought to tell the security team instead . The flight taxied and took off . While they were climbing to a cruising altitude , Ari searched her brain for a solution to the Vince problem . For the hundredth time , she came up short . So when the flight attendant announced that it was safe to move about the cabin , she did what she had to do . Getting up , she walked carefully to the back of the plane . She passed Patrick in his seat , headphones on , eyes closed . He looked younger when he slept . Peaceful . It was nice to see . She found Hugh Major in the last row , reading something on his Katt Tablet , scribbling notes on a legal pad . “
78085	78089	77787	77787	his	1491	” she said . “
78096	78112	77787	77787	his	1491	” It really did n’t appear that he did , though . Hugh looked up . “
78121	78130	78119	78119	Ari	376	” This was going to be incredibly embarrassing . “
78145	78146	78119	78119	Ari	376	” “
78149	78153	78154	78154	I	327	” he nodded . “
78159	78160	78154	78154	I	327	” “
78165	78171	78154	78154	I	327	” She cleared her throat . “
78200	78215	78190	78190	I	327	” She told him about Vince ’s call , and everything he ’d said . “
78259	78263	78245	78245	I	327	” Hugh nodded . “
78275	78276	78277	78277	You	327	” “
78284	78285	78286	78286	I	327	” “
78310	78316	78301	78301	he	1493	” He stroked his chin . “
78378	78429	78367	78367	We	1499	” Ari ’s cheeks burned from the knowledge that the team was expending resources to investigate her ex . She could only imagine what Hugh was thinking right now . If only we had n’t hired this chick . . . She pushed her hair out of her overheated face . “
78443	78444	78445	78445	Me	327	” “
78484	78488	78489	78489	I	327	” He grinned . “
78518	78536	78508	78508	You	77	” She tried to return his smile , but the effect was probably more like a cringe . “
78542	78543	78544	78544	We	1504	” “
78554	78649	78544	78544	We	1504	” he promised , pulling his work closer to him on the tray table . Ari slunk back to her seat once more , wondering what on earth the PI would say to explain Vince ’s craziness . The flight to Ottawa was only ninety minutes , and Ari dug into the duffel bag at her feet for her book . But when she lifted it out , she saw an unfamiliar glint of color there . Leaning forward , she plucked a small box , wrapped in purple paper with a white bow . “
78654	78664	78665	78665	I	327	” Georgia asked , peering over her own book . “
78670	78727	78665	78665	I	327	” Ari pulled one end of the ribbon , untying the silky thing . She slid a thumb under the paper ’s edge and freed the unmarked box . Inside , on a little velvet pillow , lay a green crystal pendant , roughly faceted into a cushion shape and set in a hammered silver bezel . “
78730	78734	78741	78741	you	327	” Georgia breathed . “
78748	78791	78741	78741	you	327	” Her seatmate pointed at a little square of paper in the lid of the box . Ari unfolded it to reveal a brief message . This is a peridot , and I thought it would look good on the chain you wear.—P. “
78794	78798	78799	78799	Somebody	99	” Georgia said . “
78804	78805	78799	78799	Somebody	99	” “
78811	78847	78848	78848	He	99	” Ari agreed , fingering the stone . It was the size of her thumbnail . And , damn it , it was her taste — more like an earthy crystal than a flashy jewel . “
78856	78857	78848	78848	He	99	” “
78861	78871	78848	78848	He	99	” Georgia said , a smile in her voice . “
78901	78913	78914	78914	I	327	” Ari lifted her hair , but then dropped it again . “
78918	78922	78914	78914	I	327	” she said . “
78926	78933	78934	78934	He	99	” She blew out a breath . “
78981	78988	78974	78974	I	327	” Georgia made a sad face . “
79016	79023	79024	79024	He	99	” That just made Ari squirm . “
79031	79032	79024	79024	He	99	” “
79046	79056	79038	79038	I	327	” Georgia tapped the box in Ari ’s hand . “
79088	79783	79081	79081	his	99	” Last night she ’d gotten a better glimpse at Patrick ’s rough edges . The story of his childhood was so harrowing it had given her chills . But that just made her decision even easier . Patrick deserved someone who could love him without reservations . And she was not a good candidate for the job . Reluctantly she put the pretty little box back in her bag and zipped it up tightly . She would n’t string him along . It just was n’t fair . TWENTY - THREE There were certain places that always made O’Doul feel like a punk kid again , and the hotel in Ottawa was one of them . The team frequently stayed at the hundred - year - old Chateau , probably because Nate Kattenberger liked it . On the outside it looked like a stone castle , complete with turrets and towers and a peaked copper roof . The river swept by , a ribbon of gray in the fading twilight . Inside the lobby , the team gathered beside one of the oak - paneled walls , waiting for rooming assignments . Even in his thousand - dollar suit , O’Doul felt like an imposter . Fusty , old - guard places always made him ill at ease , even in a room full of hockey players who did n’t care which fork he used at the fancy restaurant later . He just felt off today . They needed this win , but the game had him on edge . They were ranked higher than Ottawa , but there were no guarantees . And it was still unclear whether he or Crikey would take tomorrow ’s fight . None of that had him so ruffled , though , as the fact that he ’d spilled his guts to Ari last night and then slipped a gift into her bag . O’Doul thought he knew what it meant to be vulnerable . Usually it meant letting a giant on skates swing his fist into his face . But the toughest fight in the NHL now paled in comparison to laying his heart — and his awful history — at Ari ’s feet . She had n’t brought up their midnight trip through his horrible childhood this morning . They ’d gotten up late because of Ari ’s headache . And when they finally did rouse themselves , she was in such pain that conversation — aside from her profuse apologies for getting wasted with her friends in his apartment — didn’t happen . Now she was only ten yards away , but it might as well have been ten thousand miles . Sitting on a velvet sofa with Georgia , her dark , wavy hair gleaming under the soft light of the chandeliers , the sight of her was like a low - grade ache in his chest . He ’d always made fun of his teammates who ’d lost their heads over a woman . But he got it now . There ’d been a lot of things he ’d yearned for in his life . A quiet place to sleep , where nobody would jump him . A fine meal . A good glass of Scotch . And winning — he’d always wanted to win . Wanting Ari was n’t like any of those other wants . It was far more terrifying . In the first place , there was too much that was out of his control . He ’d always been able to say : if I just work a little harder , I can have this . If I just put in the hours . That was n’t the case with Ari . Even as he dreamt up the next romantic thing he might do for her , he knew it might never be enough . She could decide that a punk from the wrong end of Minneapolis was n’t what she needed in her life . There would n’t be a damn thing he could do about it . Jimbo came over eventually and passed out room keys . “
79792	79810	79788	79788	Trevi	372	” He handed them over , and one by one the players headed for the elevator banks . “
79813	79984	79788	79788	Trevi	372	” He took his key with a glance at the velvet sofa . The women were already gone . He went upstairs , his footsteps hushed by thick carpets beneath his feet . He let himself into a room with a four - poster bed piled high with ornamental pillows . He set his bag on a fussy upholstered bench and walked over to the heavily draped window to peer out at the city lights . The first eighteen years of his life had been lived within a thirty mile radius of the hospital where he was born . The first time he was ever on a plane was when the Long Island team had invited him to participate in a training camp . He ’d been busting his butt for an ECHL team , making five hundred dollars a week . In the summer he worked for a landscaping company , mowing lawns and planting hydrangeas . Then all of a sudden he ’s on a jet to LaGuardia . “
79992	80017	80018	80018	I	327	” Hugh Major had asked him when he ’d stepped off the plane . Those were the first words Hugh ever spoke to him . “
80024	80071	80018	80018	I	327	” he ’d had to say . Hugh had gotten one of the office assistants to drive him to a Brooks Brothers . In the store , the salesman had asked him questions about how he wanted to be fitted . All the words were unfamiliar . “
80073	80075	80018	80018	I	327	” and “
80077	80079	80281	80281	sweetheart	609	” and “
80083	80239	80240	80240	Patrick	609	” He did n’t have any idea what they were asking him . He ’d bought the suit , and he ’d had to use both of his credit cards to pay for it , all the time praying that he ’d make the roster , if only to pay off his suit . The team put him up in a cheap hotel right under the JFK airport flight path , and his dreams were filled with sonic booms . Fast forward a decade , and he was wearing a three - hundred - dollar shirt and peering out the window of a five - star hotel . He ’d been to each of the thirty NHL cities , and then some . But there were days when it all seemed like some kind of cosmic joke , where he was sure he was the punchline . There was a tap on the connecting door . “
80242	80261	80262	80262	Ari	376	” Ari ’s voice was muffled from the other side . He crossed the room in four paces . “
80264	80278	80281	80281	sweetheart	609	” He opened his side of the door , and there she was . “
80289	80290	80283	80283	You	609	” “
80301	80311	80283	80283	You	609	” she said , not quite meeting his eyes . “
80321	80328	80313	80313	I	327	” His stomach dropped a notch . “
80332	80371	80313	80313	I	327	” He stepped back and she entered the room carrying the box he ’d slipped into her bag , and a worried expression . His stomach dropped all the way to the soles of his expensive dress shoes . “
80376	80388	80313	80313	I	327	” she said , finally lifting her soft gaze to his . “
80421	80422	80423	80423	I	327	” “
80428	80465	80423	80423	I	327	” He took a half step forward , meaning to pull her into his arms , but something in her expression stopped him . She reached forward , offering the box . He took it reluctantly . “
80471	80478	80423	80423	I	327	” he said . She hesitated . “
80481	80523	80423	80423	I	327	” He turned , removing his suit coat and tossing it on the bed . Then he sat down at one end of a smallish couch with carved wooden legs . Ari took the other side . He tapped the box . “
80573	80587	80556	80556	you	1510	” Her eyes were a little shiny by the time she spoke again . “
80614	80619	80607	80607	You	1510	” She swallowed hard . “
80647	80722	80723	80723	I	327	” An hour ago he would have thought it would be devastating to be rejected by the only woman he ’d ever really wanted . But there she sat , two feet away , needing him to understand . So while he wished her decision were different , it was n’t hard to agree . Sliding down the sofa a foot or so , he gathered her into a hug against his favorite tie . “
80733	80734	80723	80723	I	327	” “
80738	80751	80752	80752	I	327	” She took a deep breath and wrapped her arms around him . “
80756	80757	80752	80752	I	327	” “
80778	80779	80772	80772	you	1510	” “
80782	80783	80772	80772	you	1510	” “
80795	80796	80772	80772	you	1510	” “
80801	80802	80772	80772	you	1510	” “
80864	80871	80872	80872	God	839	” She smiled against his cheek . “
80897	80898	80889	80889	I	327	” “
80904	80932	80889	80889	I	327	” She laughed . At least he had her laughing . Ari straightened up , flicked a single tear away from her cheek and smiled at him . “
80939	80940	80944	80944	babe	327	” “
80946	80954	80944	80944	babe	327	” He offered her the box again . “
80967	80978	80979	80979	You	1510	” She took it from his hand and opened it . “
81007	81033	81035	81035	you	1510	” She reached behind her neck and removed the silver chain she wore . Then she opened the box and threaded the pendant through it . “
81040	81041	81035	81035	you	1510	” “
81044	81107	81035	81035	you	1510	” She pulled her hair to the side , swiveling to turn her back , and he carefully lowered the pendant over her head , securing the chain with clumsy fingers around her slender neck . The urge to kiss the back of her neck was so strong , but he did the right thing and abstained . He stood up instead . “
81130	81139	81140	81140	You	1510	” Ari stood up , straightening her skirt . “
81170	81171	81164	81164	you	1510	” “
81174	81187	81164	81164	you	1510	” He grabbed his jacket off the bed and put it on . “
81192	81224	81164	81164	you	1510	” He smoothed down his lapels ( a word he ’d managed to learn while shopping for his second or third suit ) and joined her in front of the door . “
81228	81314	81315	81315	You	1510	” she whispered , her hand on the knob . He did n’t have to ask what she meant . It sucked that she did n’t want everything he wanted to give her . But if she wanted to be friends , he ’d do it . He ’d do anything she asked . He bent down and kissed her forehead . Just once . It was enough to fill his head with her lavender scent , and he had to hold back a sigh . “
81333	81354	81355	81355	I	327	” Downstairs , they reached the dining room together . Trevi and Beacon stood there , practically tapping their feet . “
81359	81363	81364	81364	They	1522	” Beacon complained . “
81373	81374	81364	81364	They	1522	” “
81379	81389	81392	81392	Ari	376	” Castro said , catching up to the group . “
81412	81413	81414	81414	You	376	” “
81418	81422	81414	81414	You	376	” Ari said . “
81434	81465	81414	81414	You	376	” She smiled at the silly young forward , and O’Doul noticed her fingers flutter up to her breastbone and touch the pendant that hung there before falling away again . “
81472	81476	81414	81414	You	376	” Castro said . “
81482	81518	81414	81414	You	376	” O’Doul had the sudden urge to yank Castro ’s chin upwards , removing his eyes from Ari ’s chest . Who knew there was a downside to buying your girl something pretty to wear ? “
81522	81531	81414	81414	You	376	” Ari said , touching the pendant again . “
81537	81538	81539	81539	Reeeeally	259	” “
81541	81546	81539	81539	Reeeeally	259	” Castro said slowly . “
81550	81551	81554	81554	August	232	” “
81556	81644	81554	81554	August	232	” Castro ’s eyes — plus a few other pairs — cut to O’Doul ’s . Hello , awkwardness . Slowly , and with great deliberation , O’Doul gave a single , sad shake of his head . Maybe hockey players were n’t known for being the most subtle bunch of guys in the world , but not one man said anything about it until later . After the official team meal they were allowed to ditch their suits and slink across the street to a bar . “
81649	81660	81661	81661	You	376	” Trevi asked , grabbing the stool next to his . “
81668	81669	81663	81663	she	376	” “
81672	81681	81663	81663	she	376	” Bayer said , rubbing his hands together . “
81707	81708	81714	81714	champ	1528	” “
81716	81725	81726	81726	She	376	” he said , tossing back his Scotch . “
81740	81741	81726	81726	She	376	” “
81749	81801	81743	81743	I	327	” Castro joked , nudging O’Doul ’s shoulder . O’Doul made a growling noise . He could n’t help it . He was willing to accept the fact that Ari would n’t date him . But if anyone else started hitting on her , they ’d better brace for some trouble . “
81804	81808	81743	81743	I	327	” Castro said . “
81811	81812	81743	81743	I	327	” “
81820	81837	81815	81815	you	376	” he asked suddenly . He ’d never had to do that before . Trevi chuckled . “
81872	81873	81870	81870	’em	1531	” “
81877	81882	81883	81883	I	327	” Jimbo put in . “
81909	81910	81911	81911	You	376	” “
81923	81927	81911	81911	You	376	” Trevi said . “
81942	81950	81953	81953	Jimbo	136	” the kid asked with a smile . “
81955	81967	81953	81953	Jimbo	136	” Trevi called , pulling his wallet out of his pocket . “
81973	81994	81953	81953	Jimbo	136	” He let Jimbo pick the beer , and ordered another pitcher . Then he slapped O’Doul on the back . “
82001	82002	82003	82003	My	327	” “
82006	82007	82009	82009	her	1533	” “
82016	82025	82026	82026	I	327	” But I do n’t want anyone else . “
82062	82067	82047	82047	she	1533	” Trevi looked thoughtful . “
82123	82124	82098	82098	she	2480	” “
82132	82133	82134	82134	Women	1199	” “
82146	82150	82151	82151	I	327	” O’Doul shrugged . “
82165	82166	82160	82160	I	327	” “
82169	82170	82160	82160	I	327	” “
82182	82193	82195	82195	she	2480	” He hated it when College Boy got all metaphorical . “
82224	82228	82229	82229	I	327	” O’Doul grunted . “
82250	82251	82243	82243	I	327	” “
82269	82270	82240	82241	a coffeemaker	1540	” “
82273	82280	82240	82241	a coffeemaker	1540	” Castro held up a hand . “
82289	82290	82240	82241	a coffeemaker	1540	” “
82295	82662	82240	82241	a coffeemaker	1540	” O’Doul said , lifting a hand to the barkeep . Trevi burst out laughing . TWENTY - FOUR SATURDAY , MARCH 26TH With Becca and Georgia , from a seat behind the penalty box , Ari watched every minute of the Ottawa game with her heart in her mouth . Late - season tension gripped the crowd , and the game seemed to happen at top speed , the puck flying with even more velocity than normal . Her eyes followed Patrick everywhere . She could pretend her interest was based on concern for his iliopsoas muscles , but that would be a lie . He ’d gotten under her skin . As she watched him fly by on the ice , looking as fit and energetic as she ’d ever seen him , she felt a tug . I just told him no , she reminded herself . In the third period , Ari had the thrill of watching Patrick score against Ottawa . It was a beautiful shot , too . A wrister that Trevi had passed backward to keep it away from the other team ’s defenseman . It flew right to the tape on Patrick ’s stick . A nanosecond later he ’d sent it flying over the goalie ’s knee pads straight into the corner of the net . Leaping from her seat , she screamed , as both Becca and Georgia grabbed her into a hug . The score was 3–1 in favor of Brooklyn , with the clock winding down . The other team ’s response was to use their time - out , of course , and then to pick a fight . Ari tensed when she saw the other team ’s enforcer getting chippy during the next two face - offs . But it was Crikey who ultimately threw down his gloves . His tussle with the other guy was n’t flashy or even decisive . But it did n’t last too long , and Crikey seemed to only shake out his fist before the refs finally pulled them apart . Ari let out a sigh of relief , and wondered if Patrick did the same . “
82675	82685	82240	82241	a coffeemaker	1540	” Becca said , collapsing back into her seat . “
82695	82700	82240	82241	a coffeemaker	1540	” Georgia chided her . “
82708	82709	82703	82703	you	1543	” “
82717	82721	82722	82722	We	1542	” Becca argued . “
82727	82741	82742	82742	She	1544	” Georgia clamped a hand over her mouth and yelled toward the rafters . “
82755	82845	82753	82753	us	1542	” Ari snickered . Her two friends were a walking dialectic about superstition . Ari did n’t know which camp she was in , either . Could fate be tempted into smacking you down ? She hoped not . Because that would mean she had seriously pissed off fate somehow lately . Whether fate gave a damn or not , the clock still read 3–1 when the final buzzer sounded a few minutes later . Brooklyn had two game points to take back with them on the jet tonight . “
82851	82855	82848	82848	we	1542	” Becca whined . “
82858	82862	82863	82863	I	327	” Georgia said . “
82876	82905	82863	82863	I	327	” * * * Two hours later they were sipping wine out of plastic cups in front of a fake fireplace in the charter terminal of the airport . “
82913	82920	82863	82863	I	327	” Becca held her cup up . “
82937	82944	82945	82945	He	72	” Ari took a slow sip . “
82952	82956	82945	82945	He	72	” she admitted . “
83002	83006	82984	82984	I	327	” Georgia giggled . “
83017	83018	83019	83019	I	327	” “
83035	83039	83019	83019	I	327	” Ari confessed . “
83075	83076	83054	83054	he	72	” “
83083	83091	83054	83054	he	72	” Becca said , draining her cup . “
83107	83152	83054	83054	he	72	” Georgia teased . Since Becca ’s addition to the trip had been so last - minute , the travel department did n’t make her a reservation . Becca had roomed with Georgia , and Georgia ’s room had one king - sized bed . “
83157	83161	83153	83153	You	1550	” Becca insisted . “
83195	83196	83184	83184	ye	1552	” “
83207	83211	83212	83212	Leo	372	” Georgia said . “
83234	83235	83212	83212	Leo	372	” “
83240	83244	83212	83212	Leo	372	” Ari asked . “
83250	83254	83255	83255	He	372	” Georgia said . “
83283	83295	83272	83272	he	372	” She got a dreamy look on her face , then . “
83324	83342	83343	83343	Lord	1553	” Becca groaned and flopped back in the airport chair , hands raised into a prayerful pose . “
83368	83369	83370	83370	You	1556	” “
83380	83385	83370	83370	You	1556	” Ari pointed out . “
83389	83390	83370	83370	You	1556	” “
83393	83400	83401	83401	We	1551	” Becca waved a dismissive hand . “
83417	83418	83406	83406	He	72	” “
83427	83445	83419	83419	Nate	72	” Georgia said , checking over her shoulder to make sure there was nobody nearby to overhear . “
83454	83455	83450	83450	him	72	” “
83461	83469	83470	83470	He	72	” Becca crossed her feet and sighed . “
83497	83498	83502	83502	girls	1560	” “
83504	83522	83502	83502	girls	1560	” Georgia pointed at the screen of her Katt Phone , the rim of which glowed red . “
83528	83537	83540	83540	her	2017	” She leapt up , grabbing her bag . “
83543	83547	83548	83548	She	2017	” Becca whined . “
83556	83564	83548	83548	She	2017	” She poked Ari in the elbow . “
83576	83577	83548	83548	She	2017	” “
83583	83820	83578	83578	I	327	” she insisted . If she could only manage to keep her clothes on , she might even remember what they were . TWENTY - FIVE SUNDAY , MARCH 27TH Standings : 3th Place 9 Regular Season Games Remaining Back at home in Brooklyn in the wee hours of the next morning , O’Doul ’s bed felt uncommonly empty . Which was ridiculous , because for years nobody but him had slept in it anyway . They ’d won the game , which made him happy . But there was nobody to talk to . For years he ’d looked at his married teammates and wondered how they balanced it all . Some guys made it sound like trying to keep a wife and kids happy was another full - time job . He got it now , though . Having someone to come home to suddenly made sense . The stats lighting up his Katt Phone predicted a 91 percent chance of making the play - offs , and he had nobody to celebrate with . In spite of his brooding , he slept well and woke up feeling optimistic . It helped that he was busy as hell . They had a play - off spot to clinch , so he rose early and went to the optional morning skate . Naturally , the next thing on his schedule was a massage with Ari . “
83824	83882	83578	83578	I	327	” he said , entering the treatment room with as much of a smile as he could muster . He ’d promised her once already to keep things professional in the treatment room . And he ’d told her that she was the only one who was allowed to touch him . That was all still true . “
83886	83900	83901	83901	I	327	” she said , patting his arm as he relaxed onto the table . “
83910	83911	83901	83901	I	327	” “
83918	83951	83901	83901	I	327	” he said truthfully . See ? He could do this . He could be Ari ’s friend and make small talk . She began to work her magic on his muscles . “
83962	83963	83954	83954	your	1564	” “
83996	83997	83954	83954	your	1564	” “
84000	84015	83954	83954	your	1564	” she said , and he felt her smile even with his eyes closed . “
84027	84028	84022	84022	Crikey	188	” “
84031	84044	84045	84045	He	188	” He ’d admit it to Ari , but maybe nobody else . “
84070	84071	84064	84064	We	1565	” “
84077	84149	84074	84074	you	1564	” she whispered , and the sound of her breathy voice brought goose bumps to his chest . He ’d wondered if it would sting to see her today and to have her hands on his body . It did a little . But it would sting more not to see her at all . Life had had fewer ups and downs when he had been happy to be a loner . “
84155	84159	84160	84160	I	327	” she asked . “
84167	84168	84160	84160	I	327	” “
84171	84245	84160	84160	I	327	” How odd that he had n’t noticed . It was n’t so long ago when the idea of her touching the injury at all made him tense . These days he forgot to worry at all . He rolled , and she adjusted the towel . He let his mind drift as she worked over his hamstrings . Trevi ’s wisdom about the difference between women and men floated past his consciousness . “
84253	84267	84160	84160	I	327	” he said , almost slurring the words because he was so relaxed . “
84270	84271	84160	84160	I	327	” “
84289	84290	84280	84280	you	1564	” “
84305	84306	84280	84280	you	1564	” “
84315	84334	84308	84308	I	327	” Her sweet hands moved to his lower back and he sank a little further onto the table . “
84346	84357	84308	84308	I	327	” she said , running a hand up his lats . “
84365	84366	84367	84368	Fucking Trevi	260	” “
84370	84378	84367	84368	Fucking Trevi	260	” he chuckled into the face cradle . “
84388	84393	84384	84384	I	327	” Only my heart . “
84400	84451	84452	84452	O’Doul	609	” * * * O’Doul left his massage whistling . He had a shower and got dressed . But those were the last easy minutes of the day . Hugh Major appeared as suddenly as a storm cloud , his phone in his hand , his expression full of doom . “
84454	84458	84452	84452	O’Doul	609	” he growled . “
84469	84568	84464	84464	We	1570	” O’Doul had always wondered what the end of his NHL career would look like . He ’d hoped it would end with his jersey hoisted into the stadium rafters , and a plaque on his wall . But as the manager led the way down the long corridor from the treatment rooms into the corporate suite , he knew all too well it could end exactly like this . A long walk to the boss ’s office . A door closing with a quiet click . The G.M. crossing his arms , looking both angry and disappointed . “
84574	84593	84464	84464	We	1570	” he asked when they finally reached Hugh ’s office . As if he did n’t already know . “
84602	84610	84611	84611	She	1571	” His lips made a flat line . “
84655	84717	84718	84718	Hugh	72	” The same quiet , focused calm descended on him that he felt during a fight . He played back the manager ’s words in his head , and they were n’t what he ’d expected . O’Doul had predicted that Vince might try to leverage his dirty secret via law enforcement . But reporters ? That might actually be worse . “
84729	84733	84718	84718	Hugh	72	” he said . “
84738	84739	84718	84718	Hugh	72	” “
84742	84756	84718	84718	Hugh	72	” Hugh said , folding his arms and looking up at the ceiling . “
84769	84774	84775	84775	She	1571	” Here it comes . “
84794	84803	84782	84782	You	1577	” Pictures , fuck . This was bad . “
84812	84826	84808	84808	I	327	” he asked as calmly as possible . Hugh huffed out a sigh . “
84864	84933	84934	84934	I	327	” O’Doul hesitated . Hugh had been good to him for more than ten years , but the man ’s responsibility was to the team as a whole and to Nate , his boss . It did n’t matter if Hugh was a good man , and he was fair . He had a job to do , and that job was not to save O’Doul ’s ass . “
84942	84946	84934	84934	I	327	” he said . “
84954	84960	84934	84934	I	327	” Hugh shook his head . “
84979	84987	84988	84988	I	327	” Yeah , if you need to . “
84998	85317	85318	85318	Doulie	72	” He walked out of the office suite then , just leaving Hugh behind to stew . He crossed the lobby , where a video of him scoring in overtime played in a continuous loop . Outside , the air blowing off the river was cool and damp . He turned his face into the wind and took a deep breath . He ’d been a hockey player long enough to understand that everything could change in an instant . One minute you might be flying down the ice , the puck under your control . The next second you might be smashed into the boards like a bug on a windshield . Bad news worked in just the same way . It did n’t give any warning . Quick strides ate up the two blocks between team headquarters and his apartment . The concierge swept the door open for him and he strode into the ridiculously fancy lobby of his building . If this was it — if it was all really over — he’d probably leave Brooklyn . There ’d be no point in staying two blocks from the team that had ended his career . Where would he even go ? He pushed that worry away and unlocked his apartment . He tossed his jacket on the couch and took out his Katt Phone . His finger already hovered over his agent ’s name when he realized his mistake . Shit . O’Doul shut down his Katt Phone . Then he carried it into the bathroom , placing it on the counter top . For good measure , he turned the bathroom sink on to run water noisily down the basin . He left the bathroom , closing the door behind him . He went to the landline phone — so underused there was dust on it — and dialed Tommy ’s number from memory . “
85320	85325	85328	85328	man	72	” Tom answered immediately . “
85333	85334	85328	85328	man	72	” “
85338	85339	85328	85328	man	72	” “
85345	85349	85328	85328	man	72	” Tom said . “
85354	85365	85328	85328	man	72	” O’Doul carefully relayed everything Hugh had just told him . “
85373	85391	85328	85328	man	72	” Tom asked . The man was smart enough not to bother asking if it was true . “
85394	85395	85328	85328	man	72	” “
85401	85404	85398	85398	you	72	” O’Doul said “
85407	85439	85398	85398	you	72	” without hesitation . But that did n’t mean he was n’t burning with shame just hearing the word come out of his mouth . Dumbest thing he ’d ever done . “
85442	85447	85398	85398	you	72	” Tom said quickly . “
85457	85462	85398	85398	you	72	” He thought back . “
85470	85471	85465	85465	I	327	” “
85475	85484	85465	85465	I	327	” He heard the clicking of a keyboard . “
85488	85489	85465	85465	I	327	” “
85509	85513	85495	85495	We	1586	” Tom sighed . “
85525	85526	85495	85495	We	1586	” “
85529	85530	85531	85531	You	72	” “
85535	85536	85531	85531	You	72	” “
85539	85540	85531	85531	You	72	” “
85557	85558	85559	85560	No sir	1587	” “
85570	85579	85582	85582	man	327	” His agent was quiet for a moment . “
85635	85636	85637	85637	You	72	” “
85643	85644	85637	85637	You	72	” “
85693	85696	85682	85682	They	1588	” Jesus . “
85713	85714	85705	85705	Tommy	72	” “
85717	85726	85705	85705	Tommy	72	” His agent made a noise of pain . “
85765	85790	85754	85754	I	327	” Oh my fucking god . Now his agent was offering to be his dealer ? That was not what he expected to happen . “
85816	85817	85805	85805	I	327	” “
85844	85868	85869	85869	Hugh	72	” O’Doul flinched . If they wanted to put him out to pasture , he ’d just made that really easy for them . “
85875	85879	85880	85880	He	72	” he decided . “
85903	85904	85895	85895	I	327	” “
85907	85911	85895	85895	I	327	” Tom said . “
86000	86001	85993	85993	Nobody	393	” “
86020	86021	86026	86026	you	1600	” “
86101	86102	86093	86093	we	1604	” “
86106	86107	86093	86093	we	1604	” “
86135	86136	86119	86119	They	1604	” “
86139	87260	86119	86119	They	1604	” They hung up . O’Doul went back into the bathroom and shut the water off . But he did n’t turn his phone on . Whatever it was that people had to say to him , he was n’t ready to hear it . He needed to cool his heels while Tom dealt with Hugh and the team . It was lunchtime , so he went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator . Then he caught himself just standing there , staring . Do n’t trust anyone , Tommy had said . The man was right , too . His whole life he ’d been fending for himself . No family . Even though it sometimes felt as though the team was his family , it was n’t really true . If he let them down , he ’d be out on his ass . He slammed the fridge and went to lie down on his sofa . It was so fucking quiet in his apartment . The silence had never bothered him before , but now it seemed oppressive . Naturally his thoughts went to Ari , as they so often did lately . Today or tomorrow she ’d hear about this . She ’d see the story in the newspaper or hear it whispered at work . She ’d think , What an idiot . There ’s a bullet dodged . And she ’d be right . TWENTY - SIX MONDAY , MARCH 28TH Ari slept uneasily in Brooklyn that night . Georgia had tried to convince her to spend the night in their spare room , but she had n’t agreed . Instead , she kept her panic button close by , and spent half the night listening for trouble , before finally falling into a deep sleep around three thirty . She woke up with a start when her alarm went off , and felt immediately uneasy . Given all that had occurred in her life lately , that was n’t terribly unusual . But as she came to consciousness alone in her own bed , it was n’t Vince she was worried about . This morning she woke with an image of Patrick in her mind , and a tickle of worry at the base of her skull . Maybe it was just uncertainty about the gift she ’d bought him . Yesterday after her massage appointments ended she walked Atlantic Avenue until she found what she was looking for — a dual coffee and espresso machine , the same model as her own . It made good coffee and it had never let her down . She ’d figured she could save him the hassle of shopping and just gift it to him . But was that weird ? Friends could buy friends a coffeemaker , right ? She ate a small breakfast in her pajamas at her kitchen table . An hour from now she ’d be up in front of the team , teaching a yoga class at the practice facility . Usually she used this time to meditate on what she wanted to accomplish with them . But the prickle of unease would n’t leave her . It persisted while Ari drank some water and changed into yoga clothes . Before she left her house , she picked up the pendant Patrick had given her . It was so pretty , but she felt a twinge of guilt at keeping it . So she put it back down on the dresser . But that did n’t feel right either . So she picked it back up again and put it on . The home screen of her Katt Phone glowed with her schedule for the day . Yoga class in twenty minutes , it said . Studio B. She slung the shopping bag containing the coffeemaker over one shoulder and left the house . It was a cool morning , and on her short walk to work , she felt the chill all the way to her bones . So when she reached the Bruisers ’ headquarters , she stashed her gift in her treatment room , then went straight to the yoga studio to bump up the thermostat . Ari loved teaching in this bright , modern room . It had high - tech sprung flooring and soft natural light . She hooked her iPod up to the sound system and straightened the stack of yoga blocks in the corner . Sometimes she looked around this lovely room and thought , I ca n’t believe this is really my job . Players began to trickle in one at a time , placing their mats on the floor facing hers at the end of the room . A yoga class was supposed to begin peacefully , without a lot of chatter , and they all knew the drill . So it was quiet while they assembled . Too quiet , though . Today the silence was tomblike . At first she attributed it to the early hour . But one after another the players who unrolled their mats in the room sank down on them , eyes cast low , expressions grim . Ari looked up as Georgia entered the room in her yoga clothes . She always came into the room with a cheery smile . But today she looked tired and drawn . And — this was weird — she did n’t make eye contact with Ari at all . At one minute to eight she counted heads . Most every player was there , and members of the training staff . But Coach Worthington , Hugh Major , and Nate Kattenberger were all absent . That was a little weird , too . Nate always tried to make her classes , usually scheduling his Manhattan appointments an hour later than usual just so he could begin his day with her vinyasa class . It was his favorite way of staying in touch with the team . Consequently , his management staff usually showed up , too . Not today , though . The very last person to enter the room was Patrick . Whoever is late to yoga class always ends up in the front row , dead center , and it was no different for him . He strode into the room purposefully , as if he ’d shown up on a dare . But he did n’t look anyone in the eye either . And when he took the last spot right in front of Ari , she could swear that she heard a crackle of tension in the air . That was odd . “
87264	87283	86119	86119	They	1604	” she told the class . Fewer than the usual number of attentive gazes raised to meet hers . “
87294	87306	86119	86119	They	1604	” She sat down on her mat , crossing her legs . “
87319	87328	87313	87313	I	327	” Not just from the weather , either . “
87348	87409	87313	87313	I	327	” A couple of the players shook their heads . Not everyone loved hot yoga . Ari asked her students to close their eyes and relax . She walked them through a brief meditation on the subject of inner focus . Then she hit play on her iPod . A drum rhythm started up , lending the room its heartbeat . “
87449	87470	87443	87443	Utkatasana	263	” She walked over to the thermostat and nudged it up to eighty degrees , just as an opening gambit . “
87481	87492	87443	87443	Utkatasana	263	” she said , lifting her hands in the air . “
87502	87563	87443	87443	Utkatasana	263	” As a room full of bodies dropped forward in perfect sync , Ari was full of gratitude . The power she commanded in this room was only hers because her students gave it to her . For an hour every other morning , they handed her the reins , and she held them gently . It was an honor . “
87589	87613	87577	87577	Exhale	264	” On their mats , she took them through a quick series of push - ups , and then into the basic vinyasa . “
87630	87789	87577	87577	Exhale	264	” Butts in the air everywhere — that was her view . Two dozen guys warming up their powerful bodies . Just another day at the office . Next , she took them through a long series of sun salutations and warrior poses . But there was still so much tightness in the room . And the tightest of all was Patrick . His shoulders were tense , and his movements short . He was the epicenter of the morning ’s stress . She could almost feel the others leaning away from him , as if his aura were poisonous . She nudged the thermostat ’s temperature even higher . Maybe she could burn away the tension . There was no complaining , even as sweat began to drip off the players . One by one they shed their shirts , until the room was full of rippling abs . To think that they paid her for this . “
87793	87813	87577	87577	Exhale	264	” she encouraged them as their muscles began to shake in Ardha Chandrasana , or half - moon pose . “
87851	87884	87885	87885	I	327	” She guided them into pigeon pose next , a hip opener . While they held it , she moved around the room suggesting corrections to make the stretch feel more natural . “
87893	87902	87885	87885	I	327	” Castro muttered when she stopped beside him . “
87905	87930	87885	87885	I	327	” she said , easing the position of his back leg . Then she knelt beside Patrick , touching the fold of his hip . “
87936	87979	87885	87885	I	327	” she whispered . He turned his chin so she could see his sharp , blue eyes , and she almost wish he had n’t . That piercing gaze was unhappy . And even worse , it regarded her as a stranger . “
87984	88000	87885	87885	I	327	” She meant his hip , but it came out sounding like a bigger question . “
88003	88007	87885	87885	I	327	” he grunted . “
88015	88043	87885	87885	I	327	” she whispered . She ’d glanced down the list of names on her phone in the elevator and had been surprised when his was n’t there . “
88049	88138	88139	88139	Namaste	266	” he said cryptically . Then he dropped his chin toward the yoga mat and ignored her . Yikes . She knelt there a beat longer out of confusion . Then got up again to resume the class . By the time it was over , everyone was sweating fountains , yet they appeared no less tense or unhappy than beforehand . She did n’t have many classes with the team that felt like utter failures , but this was going to go down as one of them . “
88143	88150	88151	88151	Namaste	266	” she whispered at the end . “
88153	88349	88151	88151	Namaste	266	” came the muttered response . She ’d hoped to catch Patrick and give him his present . But he bolted from the room immediately . Ariana ducked into the empty women ’s locker room for a quick shower . She changed into clean clothes and then set up for her first massage appointments of the day . In the treatment room she set up her iPod and fetched a stack of clean sheets and towels . As usual , before a massage , she pulled out her phone to shut it off . Right on the front screen she found a text from Vince . Your boyfriend is in trouble now , he ’d written . The hair stood up on the back of her neck . What the hell had Vince done ? She unlocked her phone and looked at her texts . There was one more : You think this is bad , just tell him I have video . I can make it look like the whole team is involved . There was a link to a newspaper article in the Post . BROOKLYN BRUISERS CAPTAIN ADDICTED TO PILLS Ari gasped . “
88356	88386	88151	88151	Namaste	266	” Scrolling down the story , her eye zoomed right in on the name of the club where Patrick O’Doul supposedly bought drugs . It was Vince ’s club . “
88391	88446	88447	88447	Ari	376	” she hissed aloud . But there was even a picture — sort of . It showed a man who might or might not be Patrick taking something from one of Vince ’s minions . She tried to zoom in on the man , but the resolution of the picture quickly went to seed . “
88449	88458	88447	88447	Ari	376	” Becca stuck her head into the alcove . “
88463	88464	88447	88447	Ari	376	” “
88471	88478	88483	88483	him	1611	” She held up the phone . “
88490	88561	88562	88562	Guys	2396	” She had to explain what was happening to the GM . Vince had drummed up a smear campaign to make Patrick look bad because of her . She did n’t even wait for Becca to answer . She ducked past the massage table and jogged through the players ’ dressing room . Pushing open the door to the hallway , she spotted Hugh and Patrick in a tense conversation . “
88568	88577	88578	88578	He	1611	” she said , holding up her phone . “
88618	88634	88599	88599	She	1614	” Neither man said anything . They both stared back at her with tight expressions . “
88643	88654	88599	88599	She	1614	” she asked , her voice sounding high and squeaky . “
88661	88677	88678	88678	We	1617	” As if he had n’t even heard her , Hugh turned back to Patrick . “
88686	88692	88678	88678	We	1617	” Then he walked away . “
88697	88701	88678	88678	We	1617	” Ari hissed . “
88708	88709	88710	88710	Ari	376	” “
88720	88728	88729	88729	He	609	” Patrick asked , his voice low . “
88732	88736	88729	88729	He	609	” she admitted . “
88742	88743	88746	88746	he	609	” “
88752	88753	88746	88746	he	609	” “
88756	88760	88746	88746	he	609	” she demanded . “
88786	88796	88797	88797	Ari	376	” Patrick leaned back against the wall and sighed . “
88799	88811	88797	88797	Ari	376	” He looked over his right shoulder and then his left . “
88820	88821	88822	88822	You	376	” “
88826	88835	88822	88822	You	376	” She tried to make sense of it . “
88850	88855	88856	88856	I	327	” His expression flattened . “
88883	88884	88891	88891	God	839	” “
88908	88938	88891	88891	God	839	” He stood up to his full height and lifted her chin toward his face . Those cool blue eyes looked both tired and intense at the same time . “
88957	88958	88952	88952	I	327	” “
88963	89010	88952	88952	I	327	” Of course it was . First , that photograph of their kiss . Vince had practically advertised his capacity for jealousy and vengeance . The only way this was n’t her fault was if the drug buy was real . Oh . Oh , shit . “
89015	89019	89020	89020	You	376	” she hissed . “
89029	89051	89052	89052	Jesus	155	” His eyes closed , as if he was in pain . He dropped his hand from her face and winced . “
89056	89063	89054	89054	Patrick	609	” Her mind tilted with panic . “
89083	89084	89078	89078	He	609	” “
89094	89101	89085	89085	We	1625	” he began through gritted teeth . “
89108	89117	89104	89104	My	327	” she spat , taking a step backward . “
89138	89139	89104	89104	My	327	” “
89142	89146	89104	89104	My	327	” he bellowed . “
89153	89154	89104	89104	My	327	” “
89157	89165	89166	89166	People	442	” she said , her throat constricting . “
89188	89218	89184	89184	I	327	” She choked on the last word . Patrick clenched his fists at his sides . He closed his eyes and forcibly banged his head back against the wall . “
89229	89236	89184	89184	I	327	” he said to the ceiling . “
89243	89260	89240	89240	I	327	” He shook his head and started to move down the hall , away from her . “
89285	89534	89535	89535	I	327	” He halted in his tracks , and she held her breath , wondering if he would turn around . But he did n’t . He just kept going , leaving her there , mouth open in shock , wondering what the hell had just happened . TWENTY - SEVEN Ari worked her way through four massage appointments , feeling absolutely numb . The feeling was mutual , apparently . The men on her table seemed sad and subdued . A scandal was bad for everyone . And if O’Doul got thrown off the team , their chances at the play - offs suddenly looked grim . At the first gap in her schedule , she decided to step outside . Maybe a walk around the neighborhood would steady her . When she grabbed her jacket , the coffeemaker in the corner mocked her . She and Patrick were never as close as she ’d imagined they were . In fact , the entire scope of their relationship began to look dubious . The moment they ’d started spending time together was the same moment Patrick punched Vince outside her house . He ’d chased her ex away , and then he ’d brought her home and made her feel safe . And the whole time , he ’d had entanglements with Vince , too . Yet he had never said a word . Walking down the sidewalk , she tilted her face up to the cloudy sky . “
89545	89724	89725	89725	Vince	351	” A mother pushing a stroller down the sidewalk in the opposite direction gave her the side eye on her way past . Yay . She was actually frightening people , now . She went home to her own kitchen and put the kettle on . Her mind was whirring with anxiety . She should call the lawyer and tell him this new development . She should call Georgia and offer to speak to the reporter anyway , just in case it helped the team stay out of the tabloids . She should meditate , or take an aspirin for the headache that was just starting up at the base of her skull . Or both . But first , tea . She was just turning off the burner under the boiling kettle when her Katt Phone rang . Vince . Shit . She poured the hot water over her tea bag and considered her options . The phone stopped ringing , but then it started up again a minute later . Feeling impulsive , she answered it . “
89727	89731	89725	89725	Vince	351	” she sighed . “
89742	89743	89725	89725	Vince	351	” “
89757	89767	89725	89725	Vince	351	” Fear prickled at the back of her neck . “
89773	89774	89775	89775	I	327	” “
89797	89946	89791	89791	I	327	” Just as she was choking on the word video , he hung up . With shaking hands , she opened her email inbox . The subject line of his email was , Watch me make it worse . She clicked on the Play button for the video . And the twenty - seven seconds of footage she saw made her angrier than she ’d ever been . It was Patrick on tape , and although she had no way of knowing what it was that the dealer handed him in that little baggy , he looked guilty . Before he took it , he looked over one shoulder and then the other , his eyes darting around to check who was watching . It made her want to shake him for being so stupid . Her phone rang in her hand . The caller was Vince again . “
89949	89956	89791	89791	I	327	” he said into her ear . “
90008	90026	90001	90001	I	327	” She was shaken to the core but she was n’t about to let him hear it . “
90034	90035	90001	90001	I	327	” “
90131	90132	90133	90133	I	327	” “
90140	90144	90133	90133	I	327	” He laughed . “
90169	90172	90159	90159	you	1633	” Fuck . “
90199	90200	90159	90159	you	1633	” “
90209	90216	90220	90220	babe	77	” He sighed into her ear . “
90238	90239	90240	90240	Jesus	155	” “
90242	90246	90240	90240	Jesus	155	” she gasped . “
90258	90259	90240	90240	Jesus	155	” “
90297	90298	90294	90294	you	1633	” “
90307	90325	90301	90301	You	1633	” Someone knocked roughly on the front door , and Ari jumped a foot into the air . “
90354	90437	90345	90345	babe	77	” Later , she would wonder why she opened the door . Was it bravado ? Stupidity ? Being rid of him sounded awfully good , though . Even if she should have known better . The first thing she realized when the door swung open was that Vince looked like shit . His hair was greasy , he had n’t shaved in days . Yikes . There were bags under his eyes as he looked past her to scan the room . “
90443	90474	90440	90440	nobody	518	” she said , her voice so flat that he did n’t bother checking the truth of it . Vince kicked the door shut with the heel of his shoe . “
90479	90520	90440	90440	nobody	518	” he said , pointing up the stairway . Ari felt nauseated by the idea of walking up that staircase with him again . The last time she ’d done that , she ’d ended up with a broken bone . “
90523	90524	90440	90440	nobody	518	” “
90531	90667	90668	90668	We	1648	” She turned quickly away , if only to hide her stricken face . Ten minutes , she reminded herself . And then , finally having a moment of self - preservation , she snatched her purse off the bottom step and brought it upstairs with her . The panic button still clung on its discreet metal loop to the strap . Walking up the stairs in front of Vince , a tingle of fear clung to her spine . How many hours had she spent alone in this house with him ? Thousands . But this did n’t feel the least bit familiar . Not at all . At the top of the stairs she went into the bedroom and paused in front of the dresser , waiting to see what he ’d do . “
90674	90678	90668	90668	We	1648	” he grunted . “
90683	90744	90668	90668	We	1648	” Lovely . I ’ve been sleeping above a weapon . Ari dropped her purse , knelt down and pulled her suitcase out of the way . Not much light shone underneath the hanging quilt , but there did n’t seem to be anything at all under there . What if it was n’t here ? Would Vince flip out ? “
90748	90752	90668	90668	We	1648	” Vince prompted . “
90766	90833	90759	90759	I	327	” Jesus . During the last awful months with him , she ’d worried about his bad attitude toward her job . When she really might have worried that he was prying up her floorboards to hide illegal activity . She put her hands underneath the crosspiece on the side closest to the window and waited for him to do the same on the opposite side . “
90839	90843	90759	90759	I	327	” he said . “
90846	90855	90759	90759	I	327	” Ari shoved the heavy bed toward him . “
90863	91025	91026	91027	my girl	1368	” she cautioned . He raised an eyebrow at her . But it was just instinct that had made her say it — a yoga instructor ’s reflex to watch out for body strains . It was n’t affection , it was self - preservation . If he injured himself she would n’t be rid of him as quickly . As soon as they ’d shoved the bed aside , Vince pulled a screwdriver out of his back pocket and wedged it under the molding along the wall . With a yank , he pried it up . Ari stopped herself from protesting the destruction . She could fix it all later . If he ’d only leave . She studied his profile as he frowned down at his work , prying the end of the floorboard up next . She looked at his haggard face and tried to feel something . There had once been a smiling Vince who called her “
91028	91102	91026	91027	my girl	1368	” and liked to dance . That guy was long gone , though . And this one looked like a stranger to her . Three boards were levered up before he reached into the darkness below and pulled out a ziplock bag with something heavy inside . She turned her head away , as if it would n’t be true if she did n’t see it properly . He gave a dry chuckle . “
91124	91149	91116	91116	You	1651	” I ’m not the one tucking a gun into my jacket . She was too smart to say that out loud , though . “
91156	91161	91150	91150	I	327	” she said instead . “
91173	91174	91175	91175	ARI	376	” “
91177	91198	91199	91199	Man	154	” came a shout from outside . Goose bumps broke out across her neck because it was Patrick ’s voice . “
91202	91258	91199	91199	Man	154	” he yelled . Still kneeling on the floor , Vince froze . That ’s when she heard it — cautious , nearly silent footsteps on the stairs . Terrified , Ari moved on pure instinct , slipping into the adjacent bathroom , shutting the door and sliding the hardware store latch lock into place . “
91261	91289	91199	91199	Man	154	” she heard Vince curse . The sound she heard next was the cock of a gun — click - click — just like in the movies . “
91297	91386	91199	91199	Man	154	” a stranger ’s voice asked on the other side of the door . Ari trembled . Sure , she was alone in the bathroom . But now she was trapped in here . Without her panic button , of course . Think , Ari . She edged toward the narrow little window over the toilet . It had n’t been opened in months , since the summer . Quietly , she lowered the toilet seat and then stepped up onto it , one foot at a time . “
91396	91403	91199	91199	Man	154	” the stranger ’s voice said . “
91411	91525	91199	91199	Man	154	” Vince ’s voice proposed . She could hear his fear through the wall , and it fueled hers . The other voice just laughed . She put shaking fingers to the crosspieces of the window and pressed upward . Slowly , the window opened a little ways and then stopped . Two inches of sunshine was all she ’d gained . But the cool air hit her face and she tasted victory . She braced her hands again and pushed . Nothing . So she relaxed for a second and then pushed hard . A horrible wood - on - wood squeal filled the air as the sash raised another three inches . “
91530	91905	91907	91907	my	327	” the strange voice demanded . Ari inhaled sharply , terror streaking through her chest . She braced her arms again and pushed , but fear made her inefficient . The window did n’t budge . I need to break it , she thought , her mind wheeling . And maybe that would have worked in the first place , but now it never would . The stuck window ’s wooden sash divided the escape route right in two . The sound of footsteps outside the bathroom crawled right up her throat , and then the bathroom door rattled as someone tried to turn the knob . She froze , listening . Outside she heard another squeal , this one metal against metal . What the hell was that ? She stuck her face into the six - inch window opening , getting an awkward view of the fire escape that ran past the bathroom and bedroom widows . A face popped into view at the far end of the fire escape , scaring her half to death until she realized it belonged to Patrick . He ’d climbed the ladder . Their eyes locked even as someone began to kick at the bathroom door . Patrick pointed at the bedroom window , silently asking a question . NO ! she mouthed . The man with the gun was there . He began to move , crawling across the narrow metal ledge , trying to stay beneath the sightline of the window . Behind her the kicking got louder , and she heard the first splinter of wood beginning to give out . Frantic now , Ari shoved at the window again . It moved a tiny fraction of an inch . And then all at once it gave way , slapping upward and out of her hands as Patrick forced it from the other side . Then his hands were reaching through the opening , grabbing her , pulling her through to the other side . She made a terrifying headfirst dive toward the metal fire escape , which shook as Patrick caught her . There was a crash inside the building , and then loud cursing , and it was coming closer . “
91912	92068	91907	91907	my	327	” she started to say before Patrick ’s hand closed over her mouth . In this , the most jacked situation she could ever remember being in , that rough palm was actually calming . Then it moved to her shoulder , asking her to stay put . The next two seconds seemed to take a year . Patrick crouched over her as someone moved through the bathroom . She tensed as the moment of their discovery approached . Except Patrick suddenly sprang upwards . There was the sick sound of his fist connecting with a face , and an enraged scream . And then breaking glass a few feet to the side of her head . Apparently Ari was n’t the only one who ’d thought of leaving the premises via a window . But nobody came through the broken bedroom window , and Patrick was urging her toward the ladder at the end . “
92072	92093	91907	91907	my	327	” he barked in her ear . He had her by the shoulder and by the waistband of her jeans . “
92096	92209	91907	91907	my	327	” She crawled on command toward the other end . When the ladder came into view she turned her body around and scrambled down it . As she moved , a single gunshot rang out , which was followed by a scream . Her feet connected with the asphalt , but she was n’t ready . She folded onto the pavement , bile in her throat . Patrick landed on the ground a few seconds later . He scooped her up and parked her against his side , drag - carrying her to the front edge of the building . He peered around the corner while she tried to catch her breath . “
92213	92220	91907	91907	my	327	” He pointed across the street . “
92225	92291	91907	91907	my	327	” She did it , because it was so much easier to follow his instructions than to think about what was happening . She ran , his footsteps right behind her . He threw open the door and they slipped inside , startling a skinny man in a waiter ’s apron who was rolling silverware into cloth napkins at a table just inside the door . “
92295	92363	91907	91907	my	327	” Patrick ordered the man as he flipped the lock on the restaurant ’s front door . The waiter ’s eyes got huge , but he slipped a phone out of his breast pocket and lit it . Patrick must not have thought he was moving fast enough , because he grabbed the phone out of the guy ’s hands . A moment later he spoke rapidly . “
92394	92400	92403	92403	I	327	” Two or three men ? “
92419	92545	92546	92546	Baby	783	” He dropped his gaze to look at Ari . She was seated on a wooden chair that she did n’t remember pulling out from the table , her chest heaving . She was so disoriented . As if her mind had become jet - lagged by the last ten minutes . Looking up into Patrick ’s cool blue eyes helped a little . She found her center as he stared back , reminding her that they were both still here , and both okay . Okayish . She could n’t stop shaking . Patrick let out a huge breath and dropped the phone onto the waiter ’s table . Then he knelt down in front of her and took her wrists in his hands . “
92552	92579	92546	92546	Baby	783	” She looked down to discover that he was right . Her hands had many vicious scratches across the palms and the undersides of her fingers . “
92587	92592	92546	92546	Baby	783	” he said quietly . “
92603	92629	92632	92632	sweetheart	783	” She shook her head . But the adrenaline which had gotten her through the last few minutes was starting to sour in her stomach . “
92634	92638	92632	92632	sweetheart	783	” he said . “
92647	92669	92632	92632	sweetheart	783	” He set her injured hands palms up on her knee and reached around to rub the small of her back . “
92672	92683	92632	92632	sweetheart	783	” he said , even though she was still silent . “
92697	92792	92684	92684	I	327	” Would it , though ? She ’d heard a gunshot inside her house . Someone had screamed . She knew who it was , too . But she just could n’t think about that right now . She shoved that thought away . Sirens sounded outside . She heard loud voices demanding access across the street , identifying themselves as the police . But surely nobody would answer her door . Then she was lifted into the air . Patrick carried her further back in the restaurant , depositing her on a banquette . “
92798	92802	92803	92803	They	1658	” Patrick whispered . “
92812	92918	92803	92803	They	1658	” That turned out to be true , although she could n’t say for sure how much time passed . There were more sirens outside , one of which would prove to be an ambulance . Police knocked on the door of the restaurant and were admitted by the waiter , who began snapping pictures at some point , his phone pointed through the plateglass windows . It was all a swirl of confusion , really . She put her head on Patrick ’s shoulder as he whispered to her and gently picked at little shards of broken glass in the heels of her hands . “
92925	92948	92949	92949	I	327	” a cop finally demanded of her . She took a drink from the glass of ice water that someone had provided . “
92954	92974	92975	92975	He	327	” she said , trying to keep the detective ’s face in focus . She was suddenly so tired . “
92989	93054	92975	92975	He	327	” Ari told the story slowly , limping through the details . A paramedic worked on her hand at the same time , bandaging the cuts and using tweezers on the bits of glass . The cop began probing her history with Vince , and Ari sighed . She ’d spoken of almost nothing else lately . And she was so , so tired . “
93059	93063	92975	92975	He	327	” Patrick insisted . “
93087	93088	93092	93092	him	72	” “
93094	93102	93089	93089	I	327	” The cop flipped his notebook closed . “
93109	93134	93135	93135	Nathan	72	” They did n’t . Patrick did n’t leave her side until Rebecca turned up , showering her with hugs and making concerned noises . “
93143	93147	93135	93135	Nathan	72	” she said . “
93150	93170	93148	93148	Geez	193	” Ari breathed . It was only starting to sink in that she and Patrick had escaped from gunfire . “
93179	93186	93195	93195	Sweetie	271	” Becca just shook her head . “
93204	93205	93195	93195	Sweetie	271	” “
93208	93216	93217	93217	Vince	351	” Her friend let out a breath . “
93231	93232	93233	93233	Vince	351	” “
93237	93245	93246	93246	He	351	” Did she even hear that correctly ? “
93249	93250	93253	93253	he	351	” “
93256	93262	93253	93253	he	351	” Rebecca rubbed her arm . “
93278	93279	93268	93268	I	327	” “
93282	93366	93268	93268	I	327	” she said stupidly . She could still picture Vince as the laughing , dancing guy who owned a club because he liked to party . That Vince had n’t shown up at home in years , but it did n’t make his death any less surprising . Somehow he ’d taken such a terrible turn , and she had n’t been paying enough attention to notice exactly when . He ’d stopped dancing and started dealing with people who had murder weapons . “
93371	93430	93268	93268	I	327	” she said aloud . Becca murmured comforting sounds while Ari tried to get her head around this news . Vince had woken up today — somewhere — not knowing that it was his last . He ’d had a double espresso , probably . His favorite . Now he was just gone . Ari burst into tears . “
93439	94032	93435	93435	I	327	” Becca said , hugging her . Ari sobbed . But it was n’t grief in the simplest sense . That was simply the moment her consciousness picked to put all the pieces together . It was terrifying . You could love someone and they could change until they were unrecognizable . You could sleep over a handgun in the floorboards and not know it . You could be trapped in your bathroom while someone tried to break in . And you could escape from the mayhem while your ex - lover died within earshot . It was all too much . She hugged Becca tightly and cried like there was no tomorrow . TWENTY - EIGHT It would be hours before O’Doul could finally shut the door to his apartment on the last visitor . Friends , cops and members of the Bruisers organization had buzzed around all evening , asking questions . The police had an investigation to carry out , and Nate ’s team was preparing to handle the mess in Ari ’s house . And as soon as the police had finished their investigation , Nate ’s people would hire a company to clean away any evidence of struggle or death . They ’d secure the place , fixing broken windows and doors . Now that everyone was finally gone , it was up to him to do what he could for Ari . She still had n’t said much . After ushering out the last visitor , he locked the door and made up a bowl of soup for her . Someone — probably Becca — had had the presence of mind to order takeout and leave it there for the two of them . He brought her a tray on the sofa . She thanked him at a whisper and then began to eat the soup . But the look in her eyes was glassy . He had the impression that the slightest breeze could knock her over . As soon as she ’d finished the bowl , he took the tray away . When he returned , she sat hugging her knees to her chest , curled in on herself . He stopped himself from asking , are you okay ? There was no point . Of course she was n’t okay . She was grieving the man with whom she ’d spent her twenties . And she was traumatized by the way it had all gone down . If he were n’t so busy taking care of her , he might be traumatized , too . Sitting down close to her now , he pulled her into his lap , which was more for his benefit than hers . All afternoon his gut kept clenching at the memory of two men entering Ari ’s front door — one with a gun drawn . Nothing had ever scared him so much as those assholes disappearing into her house , shutting the door behind them . Panicked , he ’d sprinted toward the door . As he reached it , he heard the sound of the deadbolt clicking into place . Dread had clawed at his insides as he snuck around the outside of the building , looking for another way in . The whole thing had been like a nightmare brought to life . All he could do was call out a warning at the top of his lungs and hope they did n’t point the gun out the window and shoot him for it . “
94038	94053	93435	93435	I	327	” she asked suddenly , as if she ’d been listening to his thoughts . “
94062	94068	93435	93435	I	327	” He cleared his throat . “
94146	94147	94138	94138	they	1171	” “
94152	94221	94138	94138	they	1171	” He gave her a squeeze . Their gazes connected for the first time in an hour . And he felt the same thing he always felt when she looked at him — hope . Only this time , the hope was n’t for sex , or even that she ’d somehow agree that they should be a couple . The hope was that she ’d be okay . “
94230	94238	94239	94239	He	72	” she said , her voice flat . “
94252	94253	94239	94239	He	72	” “
94310	94311	94312	94312	I	327	” “
94330	94343	94346	94346	Ari	376	” He wrapped her into a hug and sighed against her shoulder . “
94348	94352	94346	94346	Ari	376	” he whispered . “
94366	94383	94384	94384	You	327	” She put her arms around him , too . He ’d never felt anything better . “
94399	94413	94391	94391	I	327	” He heard her swallow hard , the sentence sticking in her throat . “
94416	94428	94391	94391	I	327	” He had n’t meant to scare her all over again . “
94437	94444	94429	94429	You	327	” She shivered in his arms . “
94463	94511	94456	94457	That guy	2113	” Unfortunately one of them had . Just one Pryzyk had been apprehended under the Manhattan Bridge while trying to dispose of the gun that had killed Vince , and the other one was still on the loose . But nobody believed Ari was still in danger . “
94518	94522	94516	94516	sweetheart	783	” he said . “
94532	94698	94699	94699	I	327	” He held the woman he loved a little more tightly . Christ . He ’d never used that word on anybody , even in his head . On any other day he ’d probably have found it terrifying . But today he ’d known really terror . Admitting to himself he loved Ari was suddenly as easy as breathing . She pressed her face into his neck , and he closed his eyes . He brought himself fully into the moment and focused on the way her soft lips felt against his skin . With his whole body , he measured all the places of their connection . The weight of her curves in his lap , and against his chest . The texture of her soft sweater against his forearms . He rubbed her back and took it all in . He ’d always been terrible at meditating in yoga class , but that ’s because he had n’t been meditating on this . “
94703	94713	94699	94699	I	327	” she said , curling closer . Poor baby . “
94752	94762	94746	94746	you	1673	” He smoothed down her hair with one hand . “
94767	94780	94746	94746	you	1673	” He kissed her forehead , then deposited her on the sofa . “
94792	94899	94746	94746	you	1673	” The giant tub in his killer bathroom could fix her right up . It always helped him after an especially brutal game . He started the tap — it was a big slot in the tiled wall , so that there ’d be no pointing faucet to get in the bathers ’ way . Then he found some big fluffy towels in his linen closet and turned the heat up , so she would n’t be cold when she got out . But when he returned to tell Ari that all was ready , he realized the bandages on her hands could be an issue . “
94912	94917	94900	94900	You	1673	” She stood up . “
94939	94940	94944	94944	baby	120	” “
94960	94968	94949	94949	I	327	” Ari gave him a weak smile . “
94981	95231	94949	94949	I	327	” He kissed her cheek and nudged her toward the bathroom . The truth was that there were a lot of people standing by to help . Her mom and her great - uncle in Florida had already bought plane tickets to fly up tomorrow to stay with her . And Becca and Georgia would have happily taken her in . The reason Ari was here with him was because he needed it , and she ’d allowed it . If she ’d gone to stay in the guest room at Leo ’s he ’d probably be camped out on the floor right now , just watching over her . Even if they were n’t a couple , he still had it bad for her . * * * After her bath he ’d tucked her into his bed . He ’d killed the lights , hoping she could sleep . Then he ’d taken a long , hot shower . Twelve hours ago he ’d thought his life was over . And maybe his hockey career was still about to swirl down the drain , but that problem seemed a hell of a lot smaller than it had first thing this morning . Taking care to be quiet , he put on flannel pants and a T - shirt and climbed into bed . Ari rolled immediately , closing the distance between them , laying her head on his shoulder . He welcomed her in with a sigh . “
95236	95241	95242	95242	I	327	” she asked sleepily . “
95246	95251	95242	95242	I	327	” he said automatically . “
95261	95262	95263	95263	I	327	” “
95266	95270	95263	95263	I	327	” he sighed . “
95277	95278	95279	95279	You	783	” “
95286	95287	95288	95288	I	327	” “
95291	95333	95288	95288	I	327	” he promised . They lay there together a while longer , and he began to feel drowsy . Her head was a comfortable weight on his body . It held him in place . He felt grounded by her presence . “
95340	95345	95337	95338	a coffeemaker	1540	” she said suddenly . “
95348	95349	95350	95351	A coffeemaker	1540	” “
95397	95409	95413	95413	sweetheart	783	” Oh my fucking god . He smiled into her hair . “
95426	95561	95413	95413	sweetheart	783	” She did . TWENTY - NINE TUESDAY , MARCH 29TH Standings : 3th Place 9 Regular Season Games Remaining When Ari woke up the next morning she was alone . But there was a note on the pillow beside her . Sweetheart — I had to go to practice this morning because I can not afford not to show my face . Georgia is waiting to walk to work with you this morning . Could you please give her a call and walk with her ? We ’re all just trying to make sure you ’re okay . — P Fine . She dug her Katt Phone out of her handbag that had been fetched from her house by one of the cops working the case . Georgia answered on the first ring . “
95569	95576	95577	95577	I	327	” Ari really was n’t sure . “
95598	95599	95603	95603	girl	1368	” “
95624	95625	95622	95622	you	1368	” “
95647	95648	95641	95641	I	327	” “
95655	95656	95641	95641	I	327	” “
95676	95749	95671	95671	I	327	” * * * Even though it was the opposite direction from their workplace , Georgia and Ari went to One Girl Cookies for lattes and pastries . And then — because you do n’t have armed psychos storming your house just every day — they sat down at a table to eat and talk , even though it made them both a half hour later to work than they ’d planned . “
95763	95774	95751	95751	I	327	” Ari said , stirring the foam in her cup . “
95820	95842	95811	95811	he	609	” Georgia folded the square of wax paper where her chocolate croissant had just been . Then she folded it again . “
95898	95899	95891	95891	he	609	” “
95902	95911	95891	95891	he	609	” Ari ’s heart leapt at the idea . “
95926	95927	95891	95891	he	609	” “
95936	95940	95928	95928	I	327	” Ari admitted . “
95979	95985	95965	95965	I	327	” Georgia made a face . “
95996	95997	95987	95987	you	1685	” “
96000	96013	95987	95987	you	1685	” Ari ’s feelings about Patrick were a confusing swirl of contradiction . “
96052	96060	96061	96061	You	1685	” Georgia smiled and shook her head . “
96065	96066	96061	96061	You	1685	” “
96069	96070	96061	96061	You	1685	” “
96108	96109	96099	96099	you	1685	” “
96114	96121	96099	96099	you	1685	” Ari said with a sigh . “
96136	96137	96123	96123	you	1685	” “
96140	96148	96123	96123	you	1685	” Georgia pushed her empty plate away . “
96175	96176	96206	96206	Doulie	72	” “
96183	96187	96206	96206	Doulie	72	” Ari agreed . “
96190	96199	96206	96206	Doulie	72	” Georgia said with a little eye roll . “
96269	96270	96256	96258	Miss Judgie McJudgerson	274	” “
96275	96284	96285	96285	I	327	” Ari breathed . Georgia patted her hand . “
96288	96289	96285	96285	I	327	” “
96331	96332	96333	96333	I	327	” “
96358	96359	96360	96360	They	1692	” “
96367	96371	96360	96360	They	1692	” Ari admitted . “
96399	96403	96385	96385	I	327	” She groaned . “
96408	96409	96385	96385	I	327	” “
96424	96464	96385	96385	I	327	” Georgia got up and took their empty dishes to the bussing station so they both could get to work . On the way toward the Bruisers headquarters , Ari checked her phone . Then she checked it again . “
96468	96472	96385	96385	I	327	” Georgia asked . “
96500	96501	96502	96502	They	1692	” “
96514	96529	96502	96502	They	1692	” When they walked into the offices , Rebecca looked up from her desk . “
96550	96557	96558	96558	You	1685	” Georgia ’s eyes went wide . “
96569	96575	96576	96576	Hers	1698	” Becca pointed at Ari . “
96616	96631	96598	96598	I	327	” With a frown , Georgia pulled a paper sack out of her purse . “
96642	96650	96639	96640	Oatmeal raisin	275	” Becca ’s pierced eyebrow hiked higher . “
96656	96657	96639	96640	Oatmeal raisin	275	” “
96674	96687	96639	96640	Oatmeal raisin	275	” Georgia turned on her heel and went into the office suites . “
96690	96699	96639	96640	Oatmeal raisin	275	” Ari asked , feeling a little uneasy . “
96709	96770	96639	96640	Oatmeal raisin	275	” The club would n’t fire her this morning , would they ? God knows she ’d been the world ’s most bothersome employee these past few weeks . But even if they ’d had enough of her , it was bad form to fire her on the same morning that police were performing a murder investigation in her home . “
96778	96782	96783	96783	Jay	276	” Becca whispered . “
96795	96796	96783	96783	Jay	276	” “
96801	96827	96783	96783	Jay	276	” Ari felt her stomach roll . She ’d been successful all morning at trying not to think of Vince ’s death . Until now . “
96847	96851	96839	96839	I	327	” Becca shrugged . “
96880	96910	96868	96868	he	72	” Twenty minutes later Ari sat fidgeting in the conference room when a woman in khaki cargo pants , Chuck Taylor sneakers , and a blue sweatshirt walked in . “
96917	96952	96915	96915	Jay	276	” the woman said , offering a hand for Ari to shake . It took Ari an extra beat to reciprocate , because she was surprised to find that the PI was a woman . “
96956	96965	96953	96953	I	327	” the investigator said with a cheerful grin . “
96972	96973	96966	96966	You	1702	” “
96983	97043	96980	96980	your	1702	” she stammered . But that was n’t quite the truth . Ari felt a wash of shame . Here she was , doing a job that was usually held by a man in the NHL , and her idiot brain had assumed that a PI would be a man . Jay pulled out a chair and sat down . “
97064	97065	97060	97060	me	327	” “
97069	97070	97073	97074	Your ex	120	” “
97077	97080	97081	97081	I	327	example”—Jay raised her eyes—“and
97088	97089	97081	97081	I	327	” “
97093	97134	97091	97091	you	1702	” Ari said quickly . It was going to be so odd hearing that from the people in her life . All she ’d wanted was for Vince to get lost . But she ’d never wanted him to die . “
97170	97171	97162	97162	I	327	” “
97176	97207	97162	97162	I	327	” Ari did not want to speak ill of the dead . But Jay would have been invisible to him . She looked like a soccer mom . Jay smiled . “
97226	97243	97217	97217	my	327	” She pulled a folder out of a messenger bag and set it on the table . “
97283	97302	97273	97274	Hugh Major	72	” Ari was afraid of what she was about to learn . But she did want the truth . “
97309	97315	97273	97274	Hugh Major	72	” Jay opened the folder . “
97356	97357	97352	97354	some guesswork involved	1707	” “
97360	97361	97362	97363	The police	2032	” “
97397	97406	97385	97385	my	327	” She pulled a photo from the file . “
97417	97418	97419	97419	Yikes	146	” “
97421	97433	97419	97419	Yikes	146	” It was a picture of a shady looking roadside motel . “
97473	97474	97470	97471	Andre Karsecki	186	” “
97479	97483	97470	97471	Andre Karsecki	186	” Jay nodded . “
97500	97501	97494	97494	he	351	” “
97504	97550	97494	97494	he	351	” Ari did n’t know how to feel about that . So she had n’t been living with a murderer . Yay . But it was still weird to realize how deeply he ’d fallen in with bad people . How had she missed that ? “
97581	97582	97583	97583	I	327	” “
97588	97597	97583	97583	I	327	” Ari tapped her fingertips on the desk . “
97611	97615	97583	97583	I	327	” Jay shrugged . “
97655	97656	97645	97645	he	351	” “
97662	97666	97645	97645	he	351	” Ari guessed . “
97689	97693	97681	97681	They	1717	” Ari shivered . “
97731	97732	97757	97759	Mr. Angelo Bettini	278	” “
97744	97756	97757	97759	Mr. Angelo Bettini	278	” She opened the folder and peeked at a page inside . “
97770	97771	97757	97759	Mr. Angelo Bettini	278	” “
97775	97776	97757	97759	Mr. Angelo Bettini	278	” “
97780	97784	97757	97759	Mr. Angelo Bettini	278	” Jay said . “
97792	97793	97789	97790	Ariana Bettini	783	” “
97796	97800	97801	97801	I	327	” she breathed . “
97809	97818	97819	97819	He	278	” Jay tilted her head to the side . “
97848	97852	97841	97841	he	278	” Ari nodded . “
97860	97861	97856	97856	They	1722	” “
97889	97890	97882	97882	I	327	” “
97895	97924	97892	97892	Vince	351	” Ari asked , then braced herself for the answer . Was he just hanging around the last year because he thought she was about to become rich ? “
97931	97936	97925	97925	I	327	” Jay said softly . “
97977	97996	97967	97967	he	1723	” Well . Ari would have to find a way to ask Uncle Angelo about this strange development . “
98003	98010	98011	98011	You	1718	” Jay closed the file folder . “
98024	98025	98018	98018	You	1718	” “
98028	98032	98033	98033	I	327	” Ari admitted . “
98040	98041	98033	98033	I	327	” “
98102	98114	98096	98096	Nobody	393	” She took a deep breath and let it out slowly . “
98123	98220	98221	98221	You	1729	” Ari had to stop beating herself up over her own stupid choices , because all the self - flagellation was n’t helping . Everyone was flawed . Everyone was complicated . Some people were lucky enough to hold themselves together , and others ended up dead from their misdeeds . Now there was something to think about . She shook Jay ’s hand and then checked her phone , finding a text from her mother : We ’ll land on time at three and take a cab into Brooklyn . See you soon , baby ! “
98224	98231	98232	98232	I	327	” Becca asked from the doorway . “
98236	98241	98232	98232	I	327	” she answered truthfully . “
98257	98258	98259	98259	I	327	” “
98289	98290	98292	98292	you	1729	” “
98294	98295	98292	98292	you	1729	” “
98317	98463	98464	98464	Your	1735	” She could n’t wait . THIRTY After the morning skate , O’Doul ’s phone glowed red with an urgent meeting someone needed him to take . With two doctors . Fuck . But , hey , at least doctors were n’t the ones you ’d see if they were about to throw you off the team . So when both Dr. Herberts and the team shrink , Dr. Mulvey , ushered him into a treatment room , he made his face as impassive as possible and followed . If he ’d failed his drug test , he ’d be in Hugh Major ’s office right now , right ? Dr. Mulvey shut the door and hopped up on the treatment table , leaving the chair to O’Doul , who sat down and steeled himself for whatever discussion was forthcoming . Doctor Herberts spoke first . “
98480	98526	98596	98600	the captain of the team	1737	” O’Doul would have sagged with relief if they were n’t watching him so closely . He did n’t know what the right response was , either . He did n’t want to be cocky , so gotcha , suckers was n’t going to work . “
98530	98541	98596	98600	the captain of the team	1737	” he said instead . The two doctors exchanged glances . “
98550	98555	98596	98600	the captain of the team	1737	” Dr. Mulvey suggested . “
98570	98579	98596	98600	the captain of the team	1737	” O’Doul managed not to roll his eyes . “
98590	98591	98585	98585	you	1735	” “
98602	98606	98594	98594	you	1735	” Mulvey said . “
98625	98626	98608	98608	you	1735	” “
98632	98638	98608	98608	you	1735	” Herberts took a shift . “
98670	98688	98657	98657	he	72	” he said . Ah . Maybe the guy was just covering his own ass , then . “
98721	98758	98708	98708	Vicodin	285	” O’Doul said . He ’d never forget the time a minor league physician gave him some Vics after a knee injury . The pills made him so nauseated he did n’t eat for two days . “
98762	98767	98708	98708	Vicodin	285	” Herberts said thoughtfully . “
98850	98913	98829	98830	that player	72	” O’Doul ’s throat became inexplicably dry . Shit . The fact that they were willing to play this silly game , pretending they were n’t discussing him had to mean they really wanted to help . He had n’t expected this . Not at all . He cleared his throat and decided it would n’t hurt to keep the farce going . “
98972	98973	98962	98962	he	72	” “
98976	98981	98962	98962	he	72	” Herberts said slowly . “
99002	99016	99017	99018	Your player	1748	” The man ’s eyes held his , and they were dead serious . “
99108	99122	99123	99123	I	327	” O’Doul probably did a very bad job of hiding his discomfort then . “
99127	99132	99123	99123	I	327	” he said suddenly . “
99139	99140	99123	99123	I	327	” “
99145	99151	99123	99123	I	327	” the doctor said quietly . “
99191	99200	99185	99186	a guy	485	” He cleared his throat a second time . “
99207	99208	99185	99186	a guy	485	” “
99222	99226	99185	99186	a guy	485	” Mulvey said . “
99254	99267	99247	99247	you	617	” Oh , boy . Here comes the head - shrinking bullshit . “
99280	99281	99247	99247	you	617	” “
99284	99289	99292	99292	he	1757	” Mulvey said slowly . “
99304	99318	99292	99292	he	1757	” O’Doul shrugged . He really did n’t want to get into it . “
99327	99331	99292	99292	he	1757	” Mulvey pressed . “
99394	99401	99387	99392	Your team sports - medicine specialist	1762	” he pointed at Dr. Herberts , “
99420	99428	99387	99392	Your team sports - medicine specialist	1762	” O’Doul nodded . He knew that . “
99461	99466	99434	99435	Nate Kattenberger	72	” The shrink grinned . “
99469	99508	99434	99435	Nate Kattenberger	72	” O’Doul said slowly . That distinction was something he really ought to tell his guys , if indeed they were still his guys when the whole scandal had burned itself out . It was potentially useful information . “
99514	99527	99434	99435	Nate Kattenberger	72	” The shrink patted his pocket and drew out a business card . “
99558	99622	99551	99551	we	1767	” He extended the card to O’Doul . They locked eyes . He hesitated , but not very long . Talking about himself sounded like no fun at all . But if it kept his head in the game , he ’d give it a shot . Once . He took the card and shoved it into the back pocket of his jeans . “
99625	99630	99551	99551	we	1767	” he said gruffly . “
99637	99643	99551	99551	we	1767	” Herberts said , rising . “
99657	99658	99660	99660	mine	327	” “
99664	99970	99971	99971	Sweetheart	182	” the psychiatrist said with a wink . O’Doul remained in his chair until they had both disappeared . Then he let out a giant sigh of relief . He ’d passed the drug test . It would n’t make sense for the team to get rid of him now . They would n’t do it right before play - offs unless the publicity was so awful they could n’t avoid it . Coach Worthington would have to let him play tonight , too , or there would only be more gossip on the blogs . So that was one hurdle cleared . But there were plenty more . He needed to speak to Ari , to lay his sorry story at her feet and ask for forgiveness . She thought he ’d gotten close to her only to preserve his good name . But that was exactly the reverse of what had happened . The moment he realized Vince and Ari were connected , a smarter man would have kept his distance . He was n’t a smarter man , though . He was a smitten one . Convincing her that he was worth the trouble was going to be an uphill battle . But he ’d do it . He ’d do anything for more of her attention . But first , it was game night . * * * After a rest at home , O’Doul walked to the stadium alone . The security guard at the players ’ entrance let him in as usual . So that was another hurdle jumped . The first person he saw inside the door was Ari . She was trailed by an older version of herself — an attractive woman with long wavy hair shot through with gray streaks . And a very elderly man . “
99973	99994	99971	99971	Sweetheart	182	” he called out before he could think better of it . She turned around , surprise on her face . “
99997	99998	99999	99999	Hi	75	” “
100001	100047	100048	100048	Mom	1098	” he said a little awkwardly , wondering how friendly he should be in front of her family . Maybe she had n’t mentioned him to her mother . Ari closed the distance between them , stood up on tiptoe , and kissed his cheek . “
100057	100062	100055	100055	Patrick	609	” Her mother beamed . “
100075	100080	100081	100081	Mom	1098	” the woman said . “
100083	100092	100081	100081	Mom	1098	” Ari warned . But her mother cackled . “
100109	100128	100098	100098	I	327	” Patrick shook both the visitors ’ hands . He was glad Ari had her family around her . “
100139	100140	100098	100098	I	327	” “
100148	100179	100098	100098	I	327	” Ari said , her eyes on her shoes . He should have felt happy for her , but it meant she would n’t be sleeping in his bed tonight . “
100184	100196	100197	100197	I	327	” he said with as much conviction as he could muster . “
100203	100211	100197	100197	I	327	” he pointed toward the locker rooms . “
100214	100218	100197	100197	I	327	” Ari agreed . “
100231	100232	100197	100197	I	327	” “
100235	100264	100265	100265	He	327	” He gave them a wave and moved down the hallway . Ari ’s mother murmured something to her daughter as he walked away . It sounded like , “
100270	100625	100265	100265	He	327	” Her daughter ’s response was to shush her mother . Smiling , he went to his locker to hang up his suit jacket and change into some practice gear . After that , he headed straight to the lounge area , which was packed with players . It was two hours until the puck dropped . Time for stretching , for last minute strategy , and for the taping of sore muscles and hockey sticks . As he moved through the room , all the conversation dried up . He grabbed a bottle of water out of the refrigerator , and the silence was unnerving . Slowly , he turned around to check their faces . Beacon looked grim . Castro stared down at his hands . Did they think he was a druggie ? Or about to be cut from the team ? Christ . He added two dozen names to the list of people whose trust he needed to win back . For more than a decade he ’d given this team his sweat and his blood . He ’d given everything he had . He ’d watched their backs in every game in every corner of the continent . But it was n’t really enough to carry them through this ugly moment . As captain , he ’d always thought it was his job to be a rock — to never show any kind of fear . He ’d overshot , it seemed . He ’d never shown fear . But he had n’t shown anything else , either . These guys were his life , and they did n’t even know it . O’Doul cleared his throat . Some sort of gesture was necessary . But what ? Ari would know , but she was n’t here . So he took a second to ask himself what she would do in a situation like this . She had so many ways of reaching people . Soothing words . Steady hands . What he ’d learned from Ari was that there was always more than one way to touch someone . “
100643	100654	100632	100632	I	327	” He almost said meeting . But that sounded bleak . “
100657	100662	100632	100632	I	327	” he said instead . “
100678	100679	100632	100632	I	327	” “
100682	100687	100632	100632	I	327	” Beacon said slowly . “
100692	100759	100632	100632	I	327	” Jimbo texted every player who was n’t currently present , and one by one they appeared in the doorway , curious looks on their faces . When the last man had arrived , O’Doul asked the training assistants to leave . Then he went over to the door to close it . But Coach Worthington was standing there , an ornery look on his face . “
100770	100836	100632	100632	I	327	” he asked . O’Doul stepped out into the hallway and closed the door behind him . Earlier today he ’d been humbled to find the organization he ’d worked for this past decade had had his back . But Coach was a new addition . Of course , he was n’t going to get the same breaks from this man who hardly knew him . “
100844	100848	100632	100632	I	327	” he asked . “
100893	100906	100907	100907	You	77	” Coach squinted at him in that appraising way that he had . “
100923	100924	100907	100907	You	77	” “
100927	100933	100934	100934	I	327	” he said without hesitation . “
100937	100941	100934	100934	I	327	” Coach nodded . “
100958	100959	100950	100950	We	1779	” “
100965	101058	100963	100963	sir	77	” When Coach turned to go , he went back into the lounge where two dozen pairs of eyes waited . There were n’t any seats left anywhere , so he leaned against one of the high tables and studied the faces in front of him . They were all different shapes , different colors , and different ages . It ’s sort of a miracle that they usually got along so well , given they were united by one odd thing — the ability to play hockey at an elite level . “
101061	101080	100963	100963	sir	77	” he said , wishing he had a more elegant opening . But he had to start somewhere . “
101125	101149	101150	101150	I	327	” The silence was punctuated only by the sound of a coffee cup set down on a table . Nobody said a word . “
101171	101175	101164	101164	I	327	” he continued . “
101291	101292	101265	101266	the team	1602	” “
101295	101301	101265	101266	the team	1602	” Beacon cleared his throat . “
101333	101334	101329	101329	I	327	” “
101339	101343	101329	101329	I	327	” Castro said . “
101367	101403	101404	101404	I	327	” O’Doul had never wanted to have this conversation — with the whole team staring at him , wondering how he could be so dumb . Too bad he had n’t thought of that beforehand . “
101411	101416	101404	101404	I	327	” he said quietly . “
101424	101441	101418	101418	I	327	” Leo Trevi leaned forward on one of the sofas , his elbows on his knees . “
101459	101493	101496	101496	man	327	” O’Doul felt heat climb up the back of his neck . Now he had a brand - new regret — he was sorry he had ever been a dick to this kid . “
101512	101540	101507	101507	I	327	” If he was n’t mistaken , his guys finally started to relax a little . They shifted in their seats again , and finished their drinks . “
101546	101555	101507	101507	I	327	” he asked . Nobody raised his hand . “
101592	101612	101585	101585	I	327	” He straightened up and went to open the door again . Crikey nudged him before he got there . “
101622	101643	101585	101585	I	327	” Hell . With everything going on , he ’d missed his usual twenty - four hours of nervous preparation . “
101651	101652	101585	101585	I	327	” “
101677	101684	101688	101688	him	145	” O’Doul squeezed Crikey ’s biceps . “
101712	101731	101703	101703	You	1798	” He opened the door , and players began to disperse to the dressing room or to stretch . “
101740	101770	101703	101703	You	1798	” Trevi asked . A few guys followed him out . The room quieted down , and O’Doul took a newly emptied seat next to Beacon on the sofa . “
101777	101788	101772	101772	I	327	” The goalie ran a hand over his own jaw . “
101798	101799	101772	101772	I	327	” “
101804	101813	101772	101772	I	327	” He ’d never said this out loud . “
101851	101857	101866	101866	man	327	” Beacon shook his head . “
101892	101893	101880	101880	I	327	” “
101901	102036	101880	101880	I	327	” he said , laughing it off . But the truth was that he liked hearing Beacon say it — that it was n’t easy . Maybe he did n’t always have to pretend that it was . * * * All the rest of the pre - game chatter was about points and play - off standings . They were playing Boston again , the team which was their greatest rival for a play - offs spot . If they lost to Boston , they ’d be knocked into fourth place again . So this game had double the usual weight . If they won , the play - offs were within reach . Kattenberger ’s Statistical Model was throbbing with anticipation over this game , assigning it an importance rating of ten . “
102043	102340	101880	101880	I	327	” Castro joked as they walked down the chute and stepped onto the ice . Tonight was a sellout crowd , and they were loud as O’Doul and his teammates skated once around the rink and then lined up for the national anthem . Tonight it was competently sung by a pop star he ’d never heard of . He found his thoughts drifting to Ari . She was probably up in the box , watching right now . Or maybe in some comped seats with her family . Even if hockey had been kicking his ass this winter , he still felt that zing . Standing here facing the opposing team , ready to do battle . It was still the best kind of rush . Tonight he was paired with Massey , and they started first shift . The other team ’s offensive line kept them busy from the first second . He slipped into the zone right away , his entire consciousness focused on the action at hand . His stick became an extension of his will — darting out to foil the other team again and again . Midway through the first period , Leo Trevi scored an ugly goal right in front of the net , and the hometown fans went wild . O’Doul slapped the rookie on the ass as they skated back to the bench . The arena fizzed with excitement . The Bruisers picked up their pace even further , confident that it was possible to win this thing . Hoping to turn the tide toward his own team , the enforcer — Trekowski , the same jackass who ’d called him out on Twitter — challenged him to a fight two minutes later . O’Doul actually smiled . “
102354	102366	102352	102352	man	327	” Trekowski gave him a weird look before dropping his gloves . “
102379	102380	102352	102352	man	327	” “
102408	102478	102401	102401	You	1805	” O’Doul tried on a wild - eyed stare . He skated in a lazy backward circle . When he was younger , he ’d acted loopy sometimes when he did n’t know what else to try . Funny — he’d forgotten how it felt to be new at this . To make your own rules . At that thought , he lunged forward and grabbed Trekowski ’s sweater . “
102484	102600	102601	102601	You	1805	” Trekowski swung but O’Doul got there first . They both landed punches but O’Doul ’s was harder . Just for fun he gave a deranged scream . His next punch connected so hard that Trekowski ’s helmet flew off . He knew he ’d win just from the look in the guy ’s eyes . That flicker of hesitation . O’Doul gave it one more good punch and the guy buckled , sprawling out on the ice . The whole thing was over in seconds . O’Doul shook out his fist and picked up his gloves . On the way back to the bench , he probed his jaw where he ’d been hit . “
102604	102615	102601	102601	You	1805	” the trainer asked , opening the door for him . “
102619	102666	102601	102601	You	1805	” As the night progressed , it was true . Boston could n’t catch them . Bayer got a goal , which Boston answered . But it was n’t enough . They won 2–1 during regulation play and walked back down the chute two points richer . “
102673	102677	102678	102678	I	327	” Castro howled . “
102695	102696	102684	102684	Nate	72	” “
102703	102707	102699	102699	I	327	” Trevi complained . “
102730	102731	102722	102722	I	327	” “
102736	102742	102743	102743	I	327	” O’Doul heard himself say . “
102752	102753	102754	102754	Your	1805	” “
102757	102761	102764	102764	your	1805	” Castro asked . “
102772	102773	102764	102764	your	1805	” “
102790	102797	102798	102798	I	327	” Then he added , uncharacteristically , “
102806	102818	102819	102819	I	327	” There was a stunned silence . Then Leo Trevi said , “
102848	102872	102834	102834	I	327	” Castro flipped him off , and everyone began stripping off their pads . Before O’Doul hit the showers , he called Rebecca . “
102882	102893	102880	102880	Doulie	72	” she answered on the first ring . He chuckled . “
102923	102924	102927	102927	you	1805	” “
102934	102935	102927	102927	you	1805	” “
102941	102942	102938	102938	I	327	” “
102954	102958	102938	102938	I	327	” she said . “
103010	103011	103012	103012	I	327	” “
103016	103020	103012	103012	I	327	” he said . “
103027	103028	103012	103012	I	327	” “
103037	103038	103039	103039	I	327	” “
103047	103048	103039	103039	I	327	” “
103069	103073	103074	103074	I	327	” She snorted . “
103097	103166	103167	103167	You	1805	” She hung up on him . * * * There had never been half so many people in his condo since the day he bought it . Trevi had shown up first , given that his commute was only down the hallway . When O’Doul opened the door , the rookie dragged in a beanbag chair in one hand and a case of beer in the other . “
103175	103184	103167	103167	You	1805	” he said , surveying the big room . “
103201	103202	103167	103167	You	1805	” “
103205	103225	103167	103167	You	1805	” he said a little stiffly , relieving Trevi of the beer . He was n’t used to this . “
103236	103237	103227	103227	I	327	” “
103251	103267	103244	103244	I	327	” Trevi dragged his beanbag chair over to the wall and plopped down on it . “
103276	103277	103244	103244	I	327	” “
103280	103287	103288	103288	I	327	” Georgia said from the doorway . “
103317	103361	103306	103306	Ari	376	” It really was too bad . But Ari would be with her family tonight . The buzzer on the wall sounded . When O’Doul pressed the button , the concierge informed him that a handful of players were on their way up . “
103364	103368	103306	103306	Ari	376	” he said . “
103376	103434	103306	103306	Ari	376	” It was mayhem after that . There were jackets thrown onto his bed and players leaning on his kitchen counter , unpacking the pizzas . Rebecca had done a nice job of sampling the menu . Each pie had a different combination of toppings . Players kept knocking on the door . Everyone took to yelling , “
103439	103636	103306	103306	Ari	376	” O’Doul handed out napkins and beer . Every guy who came through the door had a six - pack , and the collection of bottles on the counter looked like the UN of beers . When everyone was finally served and sprawled around his living area like Romans at a banquet , he made a plate for himself . He thought he ’d stand at the bar and eat it , but Castro moved down his sofa , opening up a space that was sufficient if not quite as roomy as he would have preferred . He sat , though . If he ’d gone to the trouble of inviting the whole team into his home , hiding in the kitchen area went against his message . The message was hard enough to articulate anyway . He just knew he needed . . . more . More openness . More contact . Sitting there , wedged between his teammates , he wondered if it was too little too late . But Ari had shown him that some of his solitary habits were breakable . She ’d speared through a number of them without even trying . “
103641	103645	103306	103306	Ari	376	” Beacon sighed . “
103654	103655	103306	103306	Ari	376	” “
103664	103668	103306	103306	Ari	376	” Castro agreed . “
103679	103680	103681	103681	They	1820	” “
103687	103692	103681	103681	They	1820	” Trevi teased him . “
103699	103703	103696	103697	Mr. Engaged	291	” Castro grumbled . “
103713	103714	103696	103697	Mr. Engaged	291	” “
103720	103727	103717	103717	I	327	” Georgia asked from the kitchen . “
103746	103768	103773	103773	Castro	72	” There was a roar of laughter , and Castro sputtered praise at Georgia , a terrified look on his face . “
103775	103787	103773	103773	Castro	72	” Jimbo called , waving the PS4 controller in the air . “
103797	103804	103790	103790	your	1823	” O’Doul got up , too . “
103833	104031	104034	104034	yours	1824	” His guys began to gather up the plates and stack them into his dishwasher . It was the first time he ’d ever heard a lot of male chatter and smack talk bouncing off the exposed - brick walls of his condo . He kind of liked the sound of it . THIRTY - ONE FRIDAY , APRIL 1ST Standings : 3rd Place 6 Regular Season Games Remaining The team traveled to Tampa and Nashville without Ari . Her contract specified that she would travel with the team at least 85 percent of the time , and her average was already higher than that . So she spent a few days letting her mother fuss over her , and showing Uncle Angelo all the new things in the neighborhood . The windows and door that had been broken during her scariest day on earth were all fixed . The fire escape was tuned up , and a newer model ladder was installed , one that was less likely to lead to a break - in . On the first day of his visit , Uncle Angelo had told her that the house was to be hers . “
104039	104040	104034	104034	yours	1824	” “
104049	104054	104041	104041	I	327	” was her reply . “
104066	104111	104056	104056	you	327	” She thanked him profusely . And after that , she began to look at the place with new eyes . The living room walls might look fabulous in a new color . A creamy yellow , maybe , with contrasting baseboards and molding . “
104125	104130	104056	104056	you	327	” her mother suggested . “
104156	104157	104146	104146	you	327	” “
104163	104167	104146	104146	you	327	” she agreed . “
104185	104190	104146	104146	you	327	” her mom added . “
104206	104207	104200	104200	They	1978	” “
104223	104233	104200	104200	They	1978	” Ari said . Her mother patted her hand . “
104248	104249	104238	104238	You	327	” “
104258	104272	104238	104238	You	327	” she said quickly , not wanting to encourage her mother ’s fantasy . “
104278	104283	104284	104284	He	1829	” her mom argued . “
104303	104304	104305	104305	Mother	292	” “
104307	104311	104305	104305	Mother	292	” She laughed . “
104328	104540	104321	104322	a girl	455	” Ari blushed . She had indeed gotten carried away . Even now he was never far from her mind . She told herself it was because the team had so much at stake . It felt unnatural to be home in Brooklyn while they were doing battle in the south . She watched both games on television because she could n’t stay away . They won one and they lost one . Every time Patrick skated onto the screen , she could n’t take her eyes off him . And when he fought a player on Nashville ’s team she stopped breathing . When it was over he skated away with a bloody cut on his face . After the game she twice picked up the phone to call him and then set it down again . She did n’t want to give him the wrong idea . They were n’t together , and she was still mad at his betrayal . But , god , I miss him , she had to admit . The war between her mind and her heart raged on . It should be easier than this when he was n’t even in town . She should n’t care so much . Yet she did . “
104548	104600	104601	104601	Patrick	609	” her mother said at lunch the day before she left town again . Ari set down her sandwich . She ’d been thinking of him that very minute . Obviously she was so drenched in thoughts of him that she was now capable of beaming them across a restaurant table . “
104615	104616	104605	104605	He	609	” “
104629	104634	104625	104625	he	609	” her mother asked . “
104641	104667	104625	104625	he	609	” She was fairly sure that the answers to those questions were probably yes and yes . But it was too much , too fast . “
104673	104677	104668	104668	Vince	351	” she said . “
104685	104699	104668	104668	Vince	351	” Her mother waved a hand , as if waving the idea away . “
104732	104761	104762	104762	He	457	” Even that answer was complicated . Lust was near the top of the list , and she worried that it crowded out all the other saner judgments . “
104766	104770	104762	104762	He	457	” she began . “
104774	104775	104776	104776	We	1834	” “
104782	104795	104776	104776	We	1834	” her mother suggested . Ari speared an olive in her salad . “
104824	104829	104830	104830	You	1397	” Her mother cackled . “
104870	104871	104863	104863	He	609	” “
104927	104928	104929	104929	Sweetheart	182	” “
104931	104949	104929	104929	Sweetheart	182	” her mother said , and Ari heard an echo of Patrick ’s voice in that word . “
105024	105032	105015	105015	She	1842	” Ari ’s eyes felt suddenly hot . “
105037	105056	105036	105036	yourself	182	” was something she taught her yoga students , too . Why was it so hard to do ? “
105074	105079	105067	105067	you	182	” her mother said . “
105096	105097	105090	105090	I	327	” “
105103	105108	105109	105109	You	182	” she choked out . “
105132	105187	105188	105188	I	327	” * * * After Ari put her mother and Uncle Angelo in a cab to LaGuardia , she went to the practice facility for the first time in three days . She sat through a meeting with Henry and the trainers , where they went over the status of player strains and injuries . “
105199	105204	105205	105205	He	609	” Henry told her . “
105219	105220	105205	105205	He	609	” “
105224	105234	105205	105205	He	609	” she said as her heart tripped over itself . “
105238	105336	105337	105337	Ari	376	” she asked with feigned nonchalance . When the meeting was over , she was free to go home . Tonight the players would enjoy a night off , though she glimpsed many of them in a conference room with Coach Worthington . They were watching tape of tomorrow night ’s opponent . Ariana sped by the conference room window . Do not look for him , she ordered herself . You ’ll see him tomorrow . She ’d almost made it to the door at the end of the hallway when a roughened voice stopped her . “
105348	105428	105340	105340	I	327	” The sound of her name on his lips was like a sip of cool water after a hot yoga class . She had n’t even known how badly she ’d wanted it . She stopped walking and slowly turned around . He was still in his suit pants and a nice dress shirt , but his tie was askew . He leaned against the conference room doorjamb , looking like some kind of sex - tousled power broker . “
105433	105437	105340	105340	I	327	” he repeated . “
105440	105446	105340	105340	I	327	” she heard herself say . “
105456	105474	105450	105450	you	376	” she pointed into the conference room . He pushed off the doorframe and walked toward her . “
105481	105511	105475	105475	We	1847	” She watched his approach , feeling helpless . The broad set of his shoulders appeared frequently in her dreams , as did the heated look in his eyes . “
105519	105547	105475	105475	We	1847	” He ’d better suggest someplace public . If the two of them went someplace private right now , not much talking was going to get done . “
105558	105562	105475	105475	We	1847	” he asked . “
105565	105595	105475	105475	We	1847	” She shook her head to try to clear it of the sex haze that had descended on her the moment she saw him . His words finally penetrated . “
105604	105609	105475	105475	We	1847	” His eyes widened . “
105612	105613	105475	105475	We	1847	” “
105616	105626	105475	105475	We	1847	” He shook his head , smiling at her . “
105637	105638	105475	105475	We	1847	” “
105643	105644	105641	105641	Me	327	” “
105661	105665	105657	105657	them	1849	” He grinned . “
105679	105680	105681	105681	I	327	” “
105690	105696	105681	105681	I	327	” He took her hand . “
105708	105724	105681	105681	I	327	” She let herself be led through the locker rooms and toward the rink door . “
105731	105736	105681	105681	I	327	” she pointed out . “
105771	105817	105766	105766	I	327	” He was n’t wrong . The skates lined a set of shelves in a supply closet off the rink . Ari found a pair of figure skates in her size and swiped her thumb across the blade . They ’d even been recently sharpened . “
105821	105825	105766	105766	I	327	” Patrick teased . “
105836	105837	105766	105766	I	327	” “
105846	105850	105841	105841	I	327	” she argued . “
105865	105866	105870	105870	rookie	1851	” “
105888	106003	106004	106004	You	1852	” She sat down and began to lace up . It had been a long time since she ’d done this . Right after she ’d gotten the Bruisers job she ’d had the itch to go skating again . She ’d asked Vince if he would go with her to the rink in Prospect Park one weekend . But he ’d turned her down , and she did n’t ask again . Stupid girl , she chided herself . Be kind , her mother ’s lingering voice reminded her . Patrick returned with his own skates in hand and sat down beside her to lace up . He glanced at her tight laces . “
106010	106011	106012	106012	I	327	” “
106024	106031	106032	106032	You	1852	” He gave her a smirk . “
106039	106044	106032	106032	You	1852	” she pointed out . “
106076	106077	106080	106080	your	1852	” “
106083	106098	106080	106080	your	1852	” she teased . If it was , he was about to be disappointed . “
106117	106139	106140	106140	I	327	” He turned to look at her with those cool blue eyes , and her pulse skipped a beat or three . “
106191	106203	106188	106188	You	1852	” Slowly , she nodded . I miss you , too . “
106206	106238	106188	106188	You	1852	” He stood up and offered her a hand , which she took . Rising , she felt blades under her feet for the first time in more than fifteen years . “
106247	106254	106239	106239	I	327	” she said with a laugh . “
106260	106317	106258	106258	I	327	” he pointed out . When she raised her gaze , she got another little jolt from those blue eyes . And it suddenly dawned on her how close together they were . His hand was warm around hers . If she took a small step forward , she ’d be close enough to kiss him . “
106322	106339	106258	106258	I	327	” she suggested for her own good . He grinned , as if reading her mind . “
106344	106388	106389	106389	We	1853	” He led her across the rubber pads to the door , which he opened by sliding the bolt . The bright surface gleamed back at her . She ’d forgotten how magical it was to step onto a fresh sheet of ice . “
106397	106402	106389	106389	We	1853	” she pointed out . “
106407	106408	106404	106404	anyone	326	” “
106417	106498	106404	106404	anyone	326	” He turned around so that he stepped backwards onto the ice . He offered his other hand , too . She took it and stepped out onto the slickness with her left foot and then her right . Patrick gave a tug on her hands and then they were gliding together effortlessly . He moved in a gentle backward rhythm , towing her . It was like waterskiing , but the tow rope was the hottest man in Brooklyn . “
106501	106505	106506	106506	You	1855	” he crowed . “
106515	106516	106510	106510	You	1855	” “
106519	106523	106510	106510	You	1855	” she agreed . “
106534	106635	106636	106636	You	1855	” She let go of his hands . Smiling , he did an easy crossover , curving around with the shape of the rink . God , he was beautiful , powerful muscles visible through his suit pants , strong forearms visible beneath the rolled - up cuffs of his shirt . But she had to stop staring and start skating . The first couple of steps were a little shaky as she felt for the edges of the blades for the first time in years . Then she was able to lengthen her strides and find a natural gait . “
106643	106654	106636	106636	You	1855	” Patrick said , still skating backward , watching her . “
106657	106706	106707	106707	Jesus	155	” It was like flying . How had it taken so long to do this again ? Although it probably lacked grace , she pushed forward on her right foot and lifted her back leg into the air , arms outstretched , then carved gently into a turn . “
106709	106841	106707	106707	Jesus	155	” Ari did n’t spare Patrick a glance . She was too busy remembering how this was done . She flipped her hips around and skated a few backward crossovers . That felt graceful enough — on one side , anyway . Then she pressed out to the left and wrapped her right leg around , pulling herself into a spin . The rink flew by a few times in quick succession before she slowed herself to a stop . And damn it , she was dizzy . That ’s what you get for not skating for half your life . When her eyes could focus again , she looked over at Patrick . He was standing still , feet together , bent over to clutch his knees , and laughing . “
106848	106874	106875	106875	Baby	783	” she protested . He straightened , shaking his head , his face red . He could n’t even speak he was laughing so hard . “
106877	106884	106885	106885	You	783	” he wheezed after a minute . “
106894	106905	106889	106889	I	327	” He skated forward to wrap his arms around her . “
106936	106963	106931	106931	I	327	” Even as she leaned into the hug , his chest bounced with laughter . He smelled so good , like clean man and icy air . “
106971	106979	106980	106980	I	327	” he ground out , still laughing . “
107007	107008	107001	107001	I	327	” “
107015	107026	107027	107027	I	327	” She took a shaky breath against his warm chest . “
107031	107039	107040	107040	You	783	” Two big hands rubbed her back . “
107043	107044	107040	107040	You	783	” “
107047	107316	107040	107040	You	783	” She pushed her nose into his shirt collar and took a deep breath . Fighting him did n’t make sense anymore . She did n’t have to punish them both for all the scary near - misses of the past month . She could just be with him — take him home , make him dinner , and take him to bed . It did n’t mean that she ’d sacrificed all her principles , or that she could n’t stand on her own without a man . It did n’t have to be a statement . It could be just an evening with someone she liked . A whole lot . She lifted her chin . His blue gaze waited at close range . They came together in slow motion . The first brush of her lips across his made him groan . She loved that sound . So she kissed him properly . His lips were just as firm and soft as she remembered . Strong arms pulled her in . He tilted his head to the side to improve their connection . She threaded her fingers through his hair as his mouth made a sweet , eager pull against her own , and she sighed . Why had she been fighting this , exactly ? He kissed her again and again . Her libido sprang up and did a perfect sun salutation , her skin coming alive everywhere they touched . Maybe it was the ice skates , but the next kiss made her wobble . Catching her , he chuckled into her mouth . “
107319	107347	107040	107040	You	783	” She was breathing hard , and not from the skating . They could n’t get so carried away — not until they got home , anyway . “
107354	107363	107348	107348	You	1857	” she said , trying to cool down . “
107368	107369	107348	107348	You	1857	” “
107388	107389	107382	107382	You	1857	” “
107417	107418	107406	107406	I	327	” “
107421	107427	107406	107406	I	327	” She grabbed his hand . “
107440	107458	107406	107406	I	327	” His smile was amused as they began to cross the ice backward , hand in hand . “
107473	107474	107475	107475	I	327	” “
107485	107486	107491	107491	sweetheart	783	” “
107493	107568	107491	107491	sweetheart	783	” He gave her hand a tug . She turned , allowing him to grasp her free hand . They were face to face , with him skating backward . She reached up to put a hand on his shoulder , mindful to keep her strides in synch with his so their feet would n’t tangle . She ’d never skated with a partner before . It was harder than it looked on TV . “
107573	107584	107585	107585	I	327	” he encouraged , slipping a hand onto her waist . “
107590	107616	107585	107585	I	327	” He kept his stride nice and even , and she discovered she did n’t have to look down to know where his feet were . “
107619	107630	107631	107631	I	327	” she breathed as they glided past the penalty box . “
107637	107714	107631	107631	I	327	” He grabbed her hips and lifted . Suddenly she was airborne , her hip on his broad shoulder . It might have looked cool , except for the fact that she hugged his head in terror . Laughing , he skated in a tight circle , spinning her until she let out a shriek . Strong arms slowly lowered her back toward the ice , and he came to a stop before setting her down . “
107719	107740	107741	107741	I	327	” she complained , although the dizzy smile on her face made her a liar . He kissed her forehead . “
107752	107753	107754	107754	Omigod	110	” “
107756	107763	107754	107754	Omigod	110	” a voice squeaked from nearly . “
107785	107806	107807	107807	Becca	372	” There was a small thud , and Ari looked behind Patrick to find Rebecca sprawled out on the ice . “
107813	107827	107807	107807	Becca	372	” She scrambled over to Becca just as her friend lifted her head . “
107830	107831	107807	107807	Becca	372	” “
107834	107863	107807	107807	Becca	372	” Ari offered a hand , but Patrick was quicker . He crouched down and scooped Rebecca up off the slick surface and set her on her feet . “
107869	107880	107807	107807	Becca	372	” Becca said , rubbing a hand along her jaw . “
107913	107914	107906	107906	I	327	” “
107919	107927	107916	107916	you	1862	” Ari asked for the second time . “
107931	107955	107916	107916	you	1862	” her friend said . But she was leaning on Patrick , and Ari did n’t like the weird squint she was making . “
107966	107990	107991	107991	I	327	” Becca grumbled , but she let herself be led off the ice and over to a bench where she sat down heavily . “
107998	108006	108007	108007	Henry	77	” she said , rubbing her temples . “
108045	108046	108031	108031	He	77	” “
108052	108057	108031	108031	He	77	” she said quickly . “
108064	108065	108059	108059	you	1862	” “
108068	108074	108075	108075	I	327	” Becca sat up straighter . “
108094	108131	108132	108132	We	1865	” Patrick gave her a smile over Becca ’s head . He raised an eyebrow questioningly . Is it date night ? Ari supposed it was . She sat down and began to remove her skates . “
108140	108146	108132	108132	We	1865	” she reassured her friend . “
108153	108154	108132	108132	We	1865	” “
108157	108163	108132	108132	We	1865	” Becca stood up slowly . “
108183	108184	108132	108132	We	1865	” “
108187	108191	108192	108192	I	327	” Ari murmured . “
108198	108209	108192	108192	I	327	” Becca gave a wave and walked toward the door . “
108216	108228	108192	108192	I	327	” Patrick waited until she was out of earshot to ask , “
108234	108235	108192	108192	I	327	” “
108238	108246	108192	108192	I	327	” Ari said , and he grinned . “
108254	108260	108192	108192	I	327	” He checked his watch . “
108274	108275	108192	108192	I	327	” “
108278	108287	108192	108192	I	327	” Ari put her own shoes back on . “
108295	108308	108192	108192	I	327	” When she looked up , Patrick gave her a slow grin . “
108315	108316	108192	108192	I	327	” “
108320	108353	108319	108319	I.	327	” THIRTY - TWO As it turned out , Ari ’s idea for how to pass the time was not the same as his . She dragged him to the grocery store . “
108366	108370	108371	108371	I	327	” she explained . “
108375	108412	108413	108413	Your	1866	” Who was he to get in the way of that ? Besides , she was really fucking cute as she inspected the tomatoes and bullied the fish guy into giving her the best salmon filets . “
108418	108430	108413	108413	Your	1866	” he asked , carrying the bags out of the store . “
108452	108453	108445	108445	you	1866	” “
108463	108470	108456	108456	David	161	” And my bed is bigger . “
108489	108597	108482	108482	we	1868	” A half hour later Ari stood chopping tomatoes at his counter , singing along with Green Day . Patrick had changed into sweats and a T - shirt . His ass was parked against the refrigerator , a glass of wine in hand as he watched her cook . He ’d never say it out loud , but he loved having her in his kitchen . Not because he was a sexist pig , but because nobody had ever cooked for him before . Fed him . Forget the seven - thousand dollar oven that was preheating for their dinner . Ari was the luxury here . “
108605	108651	108600	108600	we	1868	” she asked . He set down his glass of wine and fetched them out of the refrigerator . When he brought them over to Ari ’s workstation , he lingered behind her , pulling her hair out of the way and kissing her neck . “
108654	108661	108600	108600	we	1868	” she said with a sigh . “
108667	108679	108600	108600	we	1868	” Cooking for me . Being with me . Trusting me . “
108686	108687	108681	108681	I	327	” “
108690	108696	108697	108697	I	327	” Her voice was low . “
108706	108752	108697	108697	I	327	” He ran a hand down her elegant back , the lean yoga muscles resisting his touch . He cupped her bottom in one hand and kissed her hair . Ari opened the tub of olives and began spooning them out onto the cutting board . “
108767	108771	108697	108697	I	327	” she explained . “
108785	108826	108773	108773	I	327	” He lifted the column of her hair and leaned in again , kissing her neck . She smelled of lavender and fresh food , and he did not want to stop . Unbidden , his hands found her hips . “
108832	108838	108773	108773	I	327	” She took a breath . “
108842	108859	108773	108773	I	327	” His fingertips lifted her top , skimming her tummy over the waistband of her jeans . “
108864	108873	108861	108861	I	327	” he asked between kisses beneath her ear . “
108878	108900	108861	108861	I	327	” Before she could answer , he caressed her , one hand cupping her breasts while the other unzipped her jeans . “
108903	108912	108861	108861	I	327	” she mumbled , relaxing back against him . “
108920	108927	108918	108918	sweetheart	783	” He smiled into her hair . “
108931	108960	108961	108961	I	327	” He heard it come to rest on the cutting board as his fingertips dipped into her panties . He teased the top of her mound and sighed . “
108970	108971	108961	108961	I	327	” “
108981	109037	108961	108961	I	327	” Grasping her hips , he turned her around , then dropped to his knees . She looked down at him with wide eyes as he took one of her hands in his . One by one he put her fingers into his mouth , cleaning off tomato juice and olive oil with his tongue . “
109043	109086	108961	108961	I	327	” He took her second hand and repeated the treatment , lingering on each finger , sucking gently , staring up into her lovely face . She ’d become flushed , with a soft , unfocused gaze that was just for him . “
109096	109218	109094	109094	Ariana	783	” Immediately , she did as she was told . He gave her jeans a tug , then pulled them all the way down and off . That left nothing but a tiny pair of panties . He leaned forward and began dropping kisses along their hemline , and down to the juncture of her legs . He paused , pressing his nose into her softness , breathing out a long , slow breath that was meant to feel warm right where it counted . He kissed the fabric once . Twice . Above him , Ari whimpered . With one finger , he tugged the fabric aside , exposing an inch of pretty heaven . He kissed that , too . “
109224	109251	109219	109219	You	783	” she whispered . He slid a finger between her legs , skimming her softness and enjoying the slickness that had begun to accumulate for him . “
109261	109282	109283	109283	I	327	” he said , grasping her panties and sliding them down all the way , so she could step out . “
109288	109303	109283	109283	I	327	” He nudged one knee until she stepped her legs a bit wider apart . “
109307	109360	109361	109361	Patrick	609	” Then he fitted his mouth against her body and began to kiss her in earnest . His erection strained against his sweats , and so he gave himself one slow stroke through the fabric . But that was all for now . Two hands gripped his hair as he tongued her . “
109363	109369	109361	109361	Patrick	609	” she gasped . Then , “
109372	109392	109393	109393	You	609	” He buried his smile in her sweetness and kept up the torture until her knees began to shake . “
109398	109410	109393	109393	You	609	” When he raised his chin , her eyes were closed . “
109416	109425	109393	109393	You	609	” she said , looking down at him . “
109430	109434	109393	109393	You	609	” he teased . “
109437	109470	109393	109393	You	609	” She reached down and tugged his chin until he stood up . O’Doul picked her right up in his arms and carried her there , tossing her onto the big mattress . “
109476	109484	109393	109393	You	609	” he ordered . Hastily she complied . “
109502	109512	109520	109520	Sanskrit	296	” Ari ’s hands faltered at her bra strap . “
109522	109523	109520	109520	Sanskrit	296	” “
109532	109539	109520	109520	Sanskrit	296	” He whipped his shirt off . “
109554	109555	109545	109545	I	327	” “
109565	109598	109545	109545	I	327	” She reached behind herself , unhooking her bra . Then it fell away . She was sitting naked on his bed , dark eyes looking up at him . So trusting . “
109602	109603	109545	109545	I	327	” “
109608	109680	109681	109681	Whew	242	” For one long moment more , she studied him . Then she tucked her knees into her body and rolled onto them , facing away from him . He saw her chest expand with a deep breath . Then , exhaling , she slid her arms forward on his bedspread , elongating her upper body , sinking onto her folded knees until her forehead came to rest on his mattress . “
109683	109729	109681	109681	Whew	242	” he breathed . At the beautiful sight of Ari stretched out and waiting for him , his dick hardening to the texture of an iron bar . He put a knee on the bed so he could press a palm to her lower back . “
109740	109807	109681	109681	Whew	242	” He skimmed his palm up her smooth back until his fingers sifted through her silky hair . Then he gave into the temptation to kneel at her ass . He ran both hands up and down her sleek body , rubbing her ass cheeks , warming her everywhere . He curled his body over hers , bending down to press a kiss to her back . “
109812	109836	109837	109837	You	1870	” he whispered , bringing his eager dick against her ass . He pushed his hips forward to show her what he meant . “
109845	109852	109853	109853	I	327	” She made a happy noise . “
109864	109878	109853	109853	I	327	” He pressed his chuckle against her spine , kissing her smooth skin . “
109888	109945	109882	109882	I	327	” As much as it pained him to leave her , he slid off the bed and dropped his sweats . Then he headed over to the nightstand for a condom . She turned her head to watch him , her eyes tracking his hand as he rolled it down over his rock - hard length . “
109952	109958	109882	109882	I	327	” She smiled at him . “
109967	109968	109882	109882	I	327	” “
109978	110011	109971	109971	I	327	” He climbed on the bed behind her again , nudging her feet apart with his knee . When he slipped a hand between her legs she gasped , and he groaned . “
110016	110025	109971	109971	I	327	” he rumbled , his fingers sliding everywhere . “
110031	110246	110247	110247	You	1872	” Well then . Grasping her hips , he pushed himself home . They both let out noises of shocked pleasure . Watching himself , he slid in and out again slowly . The view was the stuff of porn films . But it was n’t exactly what he wanted . So he lowered his elbows to the bed , one on either side of her body . Fitting every inch of his chest onto her waiting back , and kissing her neck again , he began to rock . Ari made an incomprehensible sound that may or may not have been his name . Rolling his hips , he gathered her even closer . It was probably a good idea that she could n’t see his face right now , because there was no way he could keep the look of devotion off of it . He had everything he wanted in this moment . He ’d tell her straight up how he felt — he could n’t wait to do it . But he ’d only had her back for a couple of hours and did n’t want to freak her out . So he laved the sensitive skin under her ear with his tongue , and then sucked until she moaned . “
110260	110267	110251	110251	we	1873	” she said into the bedspread . “
110271	110275	110268	110268	I	327	” he whispered . “
110282	110365	110366	110366	Balasana	297	” Love you . He slipped a hand beneath her arm and reached down until he could touch the place where they were joined . She gasped again , and pushed her hips back to meet him . He took a deep , steadying breath and bore down . This was everything . He moved inside her , listening to the rising sounds of her pleasure , knowing he ’d never been so lucky a day in his life . * * * “
110377	110392	110366	110366	Balasana	297	” Ari told him afterwards as they lay on the bed , breathing hard . “
110400	110419	110395	110395	I	327	” She laughed , and hugged him . They lay there a long time just holding each other . “
110432	110437	110395	110395	I	327	” she said eventually . “
110444	110489	110490	110490	I	327	” They got up slowly , and Ari put the fish in the oven . They tidied up the kitchen together , and he loved their companionable silence , and the way she touched a hand to his back when she moved around him . “
110497	110517	110490	110490	I	327	” he said when the prep area was clean again . She put a hand to his bare chest . “
110525	110526	110527	110527	I	327	” “
110600	110601	110597	110597	he	351	” “
110604	110609	110610	110610	I	327	” She nodded slowly . “
110613	110614	110615	110615	I	327	” “
110667	110673	110640	110640	he	351	” He cleared his throat . “
110681	110682	110675	110675	I	327	” “
110689	110704	110705	110706	Another player	331	” she asked . That was the really hard conversation , was n’t it ? “
110766	110767	110768	110768	You	327	” “
110775	110779	110782	110782	baby	327	” she clarified . “
110802	110803	110796	110796	I	327	” “
110811	110812	110796	110796	I	327	” “
110824	110832	110817	110817	I	327	” A soft hand cradled his face . “
110855	110856	110847	110847	you	327	” “
110859	110865	110847	110847	you	327	” He gathered her up . “
110874	110880	110847	110847	you	327	” He kissed her shoulder . “
110889	110894	110847	110847	you	327	” she said softly . “
110901	110902	110897	110897	they	1877	” “
110935	110936	110919	110919	They	1882	” “
110944	110945	110938	110938	you	327	” “
110961	110962	110958	110958	I	327	” “
110965	110969	110970	110970	I	327	” she whispered . “
110974	110979	110970	110970	I	327	” His heart squeezed . “
110993	111007	110988	110988	I	327	” She rolled her head to face him , amusement in her eyes . “
111031	111032	111023	111023	I	327	” “
111039	111048	111023	111023	I	327	” Ari put her cheek on his chest . “
111084	111085	111072	111072	I	327	” “
111088	111097	111072	111072	I	327	” He caressed her breast in his palm . “
111115	111116	111100	111100	I	327	” “
111124	111125	111100	111100	I	327	” “
111131	111142	111100	111100	I	327	” Ari opened her mouth , then closed it again . “
111147	111154	111100	111100	I	327	” She just shook her head . “
111172	111173	111157	111157	I	327	” “
111177	111188	111157	111157	I	327	” he said , uncertain about the change of topics . “
111198	111199	111200	111200	I	327	” “
111205	111264	111200	111200	I	327	” THIRTY - THREE SATURDAY , APRIL 2ND Ari woke up the next morning wrapped in Patrick ’s arms . And she woke up happy . Then they shared a shower in his magnificent bathroom . It was a long and multiorgasmic shower , after which she had to go home for a change of clothes before work . “
111274	111282	111283	111283	You	327	” Patrick suggested as she got dressed . “
111291	111292	111283	111283	You	327	” “
111295	111300	111283	111283	You	327	” she said immediately . “
111305	111337	111283	111283	You	327	” he teased , kissing her cheek . But it was easy . It was a relief to just give in to her feelings for him . To say yes instead of “
111344	111382	111383	111383	I	327	” Not only did she enjoy his company , but it was her nature to lean in rather than to pull away . By saying yes to him , she was saying yes to herself , too . “
111396	111397	111383	111383	I	327	” “
111403	111453	111398	111398	I	327	” he promised . And he was . Her eye was drawn to his handsome , solid form even before she ’d made it inside the door . Lola — the counter girl — was smiling at him with stars in her eyes while he inquired about the offerings . “
111456	111466	111469	111469	Ari	376	” she said , approaching . Lola looked up . “
111471	111509	111469	111469	Ari	376	” Then Patrick turned to greet her , and his whole face changed shape . His eyes lit up , and he smiled in a way that she was pretty sure he did n’t show anyone else . “
111513	111517	111469	111469	Ari	376	” he said . “
111534	111535	111530	111530	They	1886	” “
111540	111557	111530	111530	They	1886	” he told the young woman who waited with a plate and a pair of tongs . “
111563	111595	111596	111596	I	327	” Ari ordered a latte , and Patrick did n’t let her pay . He had n’t let her pay for the groceries last night , or the wine , either . “
111606	111619	111621	111621	me	327	” she argued after the girl moved away to make their drinks . “
111623	111627	111628	111628	I	327	” He shrugged . “
111638	111661	111628	111628	I	327	” Her heart melted into a puddle approximating the chocolate inside the croissant that Lola was setting down in front of her . “
111671	111681	111682	111682	I	327	” His hand found its way onto her ass . “
111721	111745	111719	111719	me	327	” He pulled her in . And even though PDA was not Ari ’s style , the kiss she received was worth it . “
111748	111752	111719	111719	me	327	” Lola prompted . “
111758	111779	111781	111781	you	376	” They broke apart , and Ari picked up her cup , not quite meeting the young woman ’s eyes . “
111783	111835	111781	111781	you	376	” She turned around to scan for an empty table , and her heart stopped dead . There sat Nate Kattenberger at a table with his assistant , Lauren . She must have made a sound of dismay , because Patrick turned to look . Then he chuckled under his breath . “
111840	111854	111855	111855	I	327	” she hissed , turning her face toward Patrick and away from Nate . “
111878	111886	111887	111887	I	327	” His blue eyes regarded her kindly . “
111926	112028	111891	111891	baby	376	” She knew he was right . But heat crawled up her neck anyway as she followed him over to the table where the owner and his assistant had notes spread out . They were obviously in the midst of a morning meeting . Anyone who glanced at their table would be forgiven for confusing the corporate titan with the office manager . What a funny pair they made — Lauren in a killer suit , dark red with matching shoes — and Nate in one of his identical hoodies and a pair of his thousand - dollar designer skateboarding sneakers . “
112031	112038	111891	111891	baby	376	” Patrick said as he approached . “
112045	112046	112043	112043	Ariana	783	” “
112049	112095	112043	112043	Ariana	783	” He had to have seen that kiss . It was n’t subtle . She could n’t blame Patrick , either . It takes two to play tonsil hockey in a bakery . Lauren lifted her regal chin and gave Ari the once - over . “
112114	112165	112166	112166	Lauren	128	” Just like that Ari ’s blood pressure doubled . Thanks , Lauren . What have I ever done to you ? She wished the floor would open up and swallow her . Patrick sighed . He set their tray down on a neighboring table and crossed his big arms . “
112177	112183	112166	112166	Lauren	128	” She rolled her eyes . “
112209	112210	112211	112211	She	376	” “
112215	112227	112211	112211	She	376	” Lauren said , capping a fancy - looking silver pen . “
112252	112285	112250	112250	Nathan	72	” Ari ’s eyes cut to Nate , who nodded at Lauren . He wore the usual inscrutable Nate face — partly amused , a little smug , and only half present . “
112293	112365	112366	112366	She	1893	” Oh , goody . Face time with the big boss just after he saw you making out with his star player . She pulled out a chair and sat down . Patrick grabbed their tray off the other table and put it down in front of her . She picked up her cup to give her hands something to do . Nate drained his own coffee and watched Lauren depart . “
112373	112374	112366	112366	She	1893	” “
112378	112383	112384	112384	She	1893	” O’Doul agreed calmly . “
112391	112395	112396	112396	Everyone	364	” Nate said . “
112407	112417	112402	112402	Lauren	128	” He chuckled , then met Ari ’s gaze . “
112455	112463	112448	112448	She	128	” He gave the famous Nate smirk . “
112485	112486	112487	112487	You	1896	” “
112491	112509	112487	112487	You	1896	” Ari asked a little too quickly . Setting his cup down , Nate shook his head . “
112618	112619	112626	112626	sir	77	” “
112628	112694	112626	112626	sir	77	” Patrick said . Ari studied the foam on top of her coffee . She liked the sound of Nate ’s words , but she did n’t trust them . The rules for women were sometimes different than the rules for men . She ’d seen the way he reacted to Becca ’s flirting . Speaking of Becca , Ari ’s consciousness stumbled over something . “
112705	112718	112719	112719	Rebecca	372	” she asked suddenly . Nate leaned his head in one hand . “
112734	112735	112736	112736	She	372	” “
112739	112744	112736	112736	She	372	” Ari broke in . “
112747	112757	112758	112758	She	372	” The owner ’s mouth formed a thin line . “
112778	112779	112764	112764	She	372	” “
112783	112787	112788	112788	I	327	” Ari gasped . “
112798	112802	112792	112792	She	372	” Nate winced . “
112832	112866	112826	112826	They	1912	” She and Patrick exchanged a glance . Becca had n’t looked too bad yesterday . And she ’d denied hitting her head . Poor girl was probably trying to save her dignity . “
112886	112887	112879	112879	she	372	” “
112911	112919	112899	112899	I	327	” He turned his gaze to Patrick . “
112969	112970	112950	112950	she	372	” “
112973	112977	112950	112950	she	372	” Patrick said . “
113013	113019	113023	113023	you	1915	” Nate turned to Ari . “
113034	113041	113023	113023	you	1915	” She shook her head quickly . “
113068	113069	113070	113070	I	327	” “
113077	113081	113070	113070	I	327	” He smiled . “
113102	113170	113092	113092	I	327	” He got up and left the cookie shop . * * * Ari had two people to see in the Bruisers offices that afternoon . She had a message from Georgia asking her to swing by . And she needed to pick up her pay stub from Queen Lauren . She went to Georgia first , of course , because she was still mad at Lauren . “
113175	113183	113092	113092	I	327	” Georgia called from behind her desk . “
113189	113190	113092	113092	I	327	” “
113195	113205	113206	113206	I	327	” She flopped down into the visitors ’ chair . “
113213	113214	113206	113206	I	327	” “
113217	113232	113206	113206	I	327	” Her friend folded her hands on her desk and licked her lips nervously . “
113261	113262	113242	113242	I	327	” “
113265	113270	113271	113271	I	327	” Ari said firmly . “
113277	113284	113271	113271	I	327	” Georgia ’s face lit up . “
113305	113306	113299	113299	everybody	2018	” “
113322	113345	113346	113346	I	327	” It had just occurred to her that Becca ’s concussion was going to affect more than the Bruisers ’ front office . “
113358	113359	113346	113346	I	327	” “
113368	113372	113360	113360	I	327	” Georgia said . “
113403	113404	113401	113401	me	327	” “
113424	113425	113426	113426	Me	327	” “
113429	113450	113426	113426	Me	327	” Georgia agreed . She got up and tossed some things into her bag , and then grabbed her jacket . “
113455	113505	113426	113426	Me	327	” When they entered the office it was Lauren who was seated at Becca ’s desk . She wore a sour face as she sorted through the stack of pay stubs with her perfect , shiny nails . It pained Ari to see her sitting where Becca should be . “
113509	113521	113426	113426	Me	327	” she said as Lauren slid her document across the desk . “
113524	113535	113536	113536	Doulie	72	” Lauren said , handing Georgia ’s over , too . “
113560	113602	113603	113603	Lauren	128	” Ari realized she had a problem . She was supposed to work with Lauren for the next couple of weeks , even though she was horribly mad at her . The only thing to do was to clear the air . “
113629	113635	113636	113636	He	72	” Lauren rolled her eyes . “
113648	113649	113643	113644	that man	72	” “
113652	113658	113643	113644	that man	72	” She cleared her throat . “
113675	113680	113666	113666	she	372	” Lauren laughed suddenly . “
113692	113693	113685	113685	Rebecca	372	” “
113696	113722	113685	113685	Rebecca	372	” Georgia asked , her eyes flashing with curiosity . Lauren leaned back in Becca ’s desk chair and smirked up at both of them . “
113732	113740	113741	113741	Nate	72	” Slowly , Georgia shook her head . “
113751	113755	113759	113759	ladies	2044	” Lauren snorted . “
113761	113770	113771	113771	Nate	72	” She slammed the pay stubs folder shut . “
113815	113866	113867	113867	Lauren	128	” Georgia ’s gaze collided with Ari ’s . A pair of startled eyes asked a question . Did she really just say that ? My god , I think she did , Ari tried to communicate . Georgia ’s mouth opened and then shut . Then it opened again . “
113877	113883	113884	113884	You	128	” Lauren ’s sneer deepened . “
113896	113907	113884	113884	You	128	” She gave both of them a look of irritation . “
113925	113939	113913	113913	I	327	” Ari and Georgia walked outside in silence , heading toward Water Street . “
113945	113950	113951	113951	I	327	” Georgia asked eventually . “
113956	113961	113951	113951	I	327	” Ari said slowly . “
113967	113989	113963	113963	she	128	” They turned the corner , crossing the cobblestone street where Becca lived across the street from Georgia ’s new digs . “
114000	114004	113997	113997	Becca	372	” Georgia suggested . “
114014	114015	114011	114011	she	128	” “
114019	114144	114011	114011	she	128	” But just as the words left her mouth , a black stretch limousine glided past them . It slid to a stop about a half a block up , in front of Becca ’s little building . The driver got out of the car and walked around to the passenger ’s side . He opened the door . Nate Kattenberger got out , carrying a flower arrangement the size of a compact car . In his other hand , he carried a giant shopping bag from Dean and DeLuca , a gourmet food shop in Manhattan . The limo driver stepped up to the buzzer panel of Becca ’s apartment building and pushed a button . Georgia and Ari halted in their tracks . “
114147	114151	114011	114011	she	128	” said Georgia . “
114156	114160	114011	114011	she	128	” said Ari . “
114165	114169	114173	114173	My	327	” Georgia suggested . “
114176	114177	114173	114173	My	327	” “
114180	114317	114318	114318	Pilates	303	” The two of them turned around and headed back in the other direction . THREE MONTHS LATER Patrick O’Doul had never been very interested in weddings . College Boy ’s wedding reception was the good kind , though . It was outdoors , for one thing . And casual . O’Doul was wearing a suit , not a tux , thank god . He was drinking a summery cocktail , watching lit up sailboats pass under a pink - streaked sky over the Long Island Sound . Beside him , Ari and Rebecca were having a conversation with Leo Trevi ’s college pal , a sweet young woman named Corey Callihan . They were discussing adaptive yoga , as Corey had a couple of physical issues which prevented her from doing some of the poses . “
114326	114330	114318	114318	Pilates	303	” Corey said . “
114351	114352	114340	114340	I	327	” “
114358	114493	114496	114496	man	327	” Ari said , and the two women laughed . It was a struggle not to stare at Ari all day and night in her sleek , strapless bridesmaid dress . The way the satin skimmed across her chest made him want to run a finger across her smooth skin . After just a couple more hours , he could . He looked around at all the happy people . Some were chatting here beside the docks , some were dancing under the white tent . College Boy had a lot of friends . There was Hartley — the Boston forward he ’d met a few months ago , and John Rikker , another player he ’d matched up against during the season . And Rikker ’s boyfriend , the sports journalist Michael Graham . “
114501	114515	114496	114496	man	327	” O’Doul had grumbled , shaking Graham ’s hand for the first time . “
114521	114522	114496	114496	man	327	” “
114527	114534	114496	114496	man	327	” The big blond guy laughed . “
114561	114562	114552	114553	your team	2367	” “
114566	114578	114552	114553	your team	2367	” Leo said , wrapping an arm around Graham ’s shoulders . “
114628	114629	114614	114614	He	1937	” “
114633	114638	114614	114614	He	1937	” Rikker had argued . “
114654	114655	114614	114614	He	1937	” “
114696	114756	114689	114689	they	1938	” O’Doul felt a zip of excitement himself . In a couple days , he and Ari were also headed for a vacation — to Mexico , because Ari said she wanted to try snorkeling . Now he reached forward and took her hand , and she turned to him . The band was playing a slower jazz tune . “
114761	114767	114768	114769	Patrick O’Doul	609	” Ari ’s eyes widened . “
114783	114784	114776	114776	I	327	” “
114789	114800	114785	114785	I	327	” he said , leading her toward the dance floor . “
114828	114859	114861	114861	you	609	” She made a happy sound as he pulled her in , bringing a hand to her slender waist . He inhaled her lavender scent and felt nothing but optimism . “
114866	114870	114861	114861	you	609	” she asked . “
114878	114883	114884	114884	You	609	” he answered truthfully . “
114886	114887	114884	114884	You	609	” “
114901	114906	114909	114909	she	372	” She looked around . “
114940	114941	114909	114909	she	372	” “
114948	114991	114909	114909	she	372	” he said , guiding her around the dance floor slowly . The makeup that she ’d worn today made her eyes look even bigger and more dramatic than normal . Had there ever been a man as lucky as he was ? “
115002	115006	114909	114909	she	372	” he asked . “
115012	115013	114909	114909	she	372	” “
115020	115021	114909	114909	she	372	” “
115030	115036	115037	115037	I	327	” She smiled at him . “
115075	115076	115066	115066	You	609	” “
115083	115089	115090	115090	Fish	306	” He kissed her quickly . “
115103	115116	115090	115090	Fish	306	” Ari snickered . Then her eyes darted toward Georgia and Leo . “
115132	115133	115117	115117	We	1941	” “
115136	115137	115138	115138	You	609	” “
115142	115146	115138	115138	You	609	” Ari shrugged . “
115156	115171	115172	115172	I	327	” O’Doul gave a little grunt of impatience for all the good times ahead . “
115184	115218	115182	115182	baby	120	” As the words came out of his mouth , he realized too late how it sounded — as if he was referring to baby bumps , not just sex . He chuckled . “
115226	115227	115221	115221	I	327	” “
115234	115259	115260	115260	Ari	376	” Ari said quickly . She looked away , studying the boats on the sound with a serious gaze . Too serious , maybe . “
115262	115267	115260	115260	Ari	376	” he said quietly . “
115270	115271	115260	115260	Ari	376	” “
115274	115310	115260	115260	Ari	376	” She still did n’t meet his eyes . The song they were dancing to ended , and everyone clapped . They broke apart then . Ari stepped back , looking ready to walk away . “
115313	115321	115260	115260	Ari	376	” he said , catching her hand . “
115329	115341	115343	115343	I	327	” He led her over to the side of the tent . “
115348	115485	115343	115343	I	327	” She shook her head , but she looked uneasy . Think , Doulie . Everything to do with relationships still came slowly to him . Although he was getting better . It helped that he was dating the best girl in the whole world . Ari always told everyone where they stood with her . She was honest to a fault . Except for right now , apparently . Her wary gaze and obvious itch to exit the conversation was his only clue . Though if Ari were mad at him , she ’d say so . That could n’t be it . So what , then ? The only times she ever avoided him were when she wanted something but did not want to trouble him about it . Oh . Oh , hell . “
115488	115497	115343	115343	I	327	” he said , cupping her chin gently . “
115506	115507	115343	115343	I	327	” “
115512	115521	115343	115343	I	327	” she said . Then she corrected herself . “
115538	115544	115545	115545	They	1943	” Her dark eyes dipped . “
115556	115576	115545	115545	They	1943	” He put his hands on her bare shoulders , his thumbs tracing the line of her slim neck . “
115583	115664	115665	115665	Ari	376	” Watching Georgia and Leo declare their love forever made something go a little wrong in his gut . He ’d never pictured himself as someone ’s forever until he ’d started spending so much time with Ari . Though he ’d assumed he ’d need to put in a few more months of good behavior and staying out of the newspapers before he got anywhere close to discussing it with her . But maybe he was wrong about that . “
115675	115683	115684	115684	I	327	” Her eyes flew upward to his . “
115690	115738	115684	115684	I	327	” O’Doul had to pause for a second to appreciate how easily those words had just rolled off of both their tongues . Forget weddings . This simple exchange was something he ’d never imagined he ’d do . He pulled her against his chest and sighed . “
115756	115760	115749	115749	I	327	” She laughed . “
115763	115773	115749	115749	I	327	” But he did n’t want to be careful . “
115803	115804	115798	115798	I	327	” “
115809	115819	115805	115805	You	327	” She sounded so skeptical it broke his heart . “
115822	115828	115805	115805	You	327	” Not much , anyway . “
115900	115907	115896	115896	I	327	” Her arms tightened around him . “
115914	115915	115908	115908	I	327	” “
115931	115932	115924	115924	I	327	” “
115946	115947	115924	115924	I	327	” “
115950	115955	115924	115924	I	327	” he said firmly . “
115993	116004	116005	116005	We	1946	” She lifted her head and gazed up at him . “
116012	116013	116008	116008	You	327	” “
116018	116024	116014	116014	I	327	” He kissed her nose . “
116042	116046	116014	116014	I	327	” Ari smiled . “
116085	116089	116124	116124	man	327	” He laughed . “
116097	116104	116124	116124	man	327	” Ari shook out her arm . “
116107	116108	116124	116124	man	327	” “
116113	116114	116124	116124	man	327	” “
116117	116121	116124	116124	man	327	” she teased . “
116126	116142	116124	116124	man	327	” She laughed and he leaned in to kiss that smile right off her face . “
116147	116154	116155	116155	They	1946	” one of his teammates teased . “
116161	116192	116193	116193	You	327	” someone else yelled . But O’Doul hung on for one more kiss . And then just one after that . Then he finally broke it off , breathing hard . “
116198	116199	116200	116200	I	327	” “
116206	116207	116200	116200	I	327	” “
116213	116227	116211	116211	Ariana	783	” he said again , testing it out again . It felt right . “
116236	116677	116233	116234	Patrick O’Doul	609	” The words hit him right in the chest . Hard . And he liked it a lot . Continue reading for a special preview of Pipe Dreams , coming out in May ! BROOKLYN , NEW YORK The first time Lauren Williams ever had a drink in front of her boss was the night the Brooklyn Bruisers clinched a play - offs berth for the first time since Nate Kattenberger bought the team . But the moment team captain Patrick O’Doul buried a slapshot in the corner of the net , securing an overtime victory against Pittsburgh , Lauren walked straight over to the bar at the side of the team owner ’s private box and poured herself two fingers of scotch , neat . Lifting it , Lauren drained her shot . Not that anyone noticed her sudden affection for whiskey . The rest of the VIPs in the owner ’s private box rushed over to congratulate her boss . This was a big moment for the young billionaire who owned the team . A great moment . But not for her . Lauren forced herself to look down at the rink where the players celebrated their victory . They ’d convened into a knot of purple jerseys , rubbing helmets and slapping asses in the way of victorious athletes everywhere . There had been a time when this team was Lauren ’s whole life . Until the sudden , awful moment when it was n’t anymore . Somewhere in that clot of players down below was the one who ’d turned her entire world upside down . Not only had he broken her heart , but he ’d made it impossible for her to feel comfortable in the organization where she ’d devoted a decade of her life . For the past two years , she ’d avoided this place and everything to do with hockey . She ’d avoided the entire borough of Brooklyn , except when her boss ’s business brought the two of them over the bridge for a meeting . And the moment she was free to go , Lauren always hightailed it back to Manhattan where she belonged . But not this month . Nate had asked her to step in and manage the hockey team ’s office and travel during the play - offs . And unless she wanted to quit a job she ’d worked her ass off to get , she had to do what the boss asked of her . Even though it stung . The sound of a cork popping brought Lauren out of her grumpy reverie . “
116681	116844	116233	116234	Patrick O’Doul	609	” cried Rebecca Rowley , the woman who was supposed to run the Bruisers ’ Brooklyn office . She held a magnum of Cristal in two hands , which she now levered toward the first of a row of shining glasses . Lauren ’s eyes narrowed at this display of joy . Miss Perky was supposedly recovering from a rather freakish concussion she ’d sustained by walking out onto the ice rink in her street shoes . What had seemed like a minor fall had resulted in terrible symptoms for the poor little idiot . She ’d been absent from work for a week already , and was therefore the cause of Lauren ’s sudden craving for Scotch whiskey . But now Becca passed around glasses as if nothing in the world were wrong with her . She poured another glass as her friend Georgia — one of the team publicists — skated into the room with a grin on her face . “
116857	116858	116855	116855	Champagne	311	” “
116862	116885	116886	116886	I	327	” Becca handed Georgia a glass , then moved on to their boss , who gave her with a hundred watt smile . “
116893	117026	116886	116886	I	327	” Becca crowed , stretching her arms around the billionaire and giving him a big friendly squeeze . Nate looked a little stunned by the full - frontal embrace . As usual , he did a poor job of concealing his reaction to Rebecca . His arms did what they probably always wanted to do , and closed around her back . His eyes fell shut , too . Lauren had to look away . The yearning just rose off Nate like a mist . Hell — hugging Rebecca might be as exciting to Nate as the hockey victory itself . Rebecca pulled back a moment later , as oblivious to him as she always was . She grabbed another glass of champagne off the table and held it out to Lauren . “
117041	117055	117029	117029	I	327	” Lauren took the glass from Miss Perky and took a gulp immediately . “
117058	117059	117060	117060	You	1950	” “
117067	117106	117060	117060	You	1950	” Becca said , her eyes full of surprise . Then she took a sip of her own glass and moved off to serve someone else , her hips swaying to the victory music that was playing in the stadium—“No
117110	117593	117594	117594	Lauren	128	” by the Beastie Boys . Lauren checked her boss ’s face , and found his gaze tracking Becca across the walnut - paneled room . Lauren had been witness to this little romantic farce for the past two years . It was like living in a sitcom that she could never shut off . And yet , if Nate ’s pining for Becca was the most irritating thing about Lauren ’s situation at work , she would n’t be drinking tonight . Her problem was n’t with the job itself , either . Before Nate Kattenberger bought and rebranded the Long Island team , she ’d spent ten years working in the Syosset offices . In fact , it had been Lauren who managed the team ’s office during its last three play - offs runs . Heck , Lauren was the veteran and Becca was the rookie . Then , two years ago , when the young internet whiz made a lot of changes to the organization , Lauren expected to be fired along with the rest of the casualties . In fact , her father — the team ’s General Manager — was the first person Nate axed after the purchase went through . Lauren was n’t fired , though . On the contrary , when Nate moved the team to Brooklyn , he stunned her by moving her even further — whisking her into the corporate headquarters of his internet company in Manhattan . She ’d been ecstatic about this change , since working for Nate ’s Fortune 500 company was exactly the sort of corporate leap she ’d always hoped to make . Not only that , but the move away from the hockey team solved a lot of problems for Lauren all in one fell swoop , including the one huge problem that suddenly knocked her on her ass . And that problem was down on the ice right now , draped in sweaty goalie pads , lining up to skate past the other team for the traditional handshake . For the millionth time this week , Lauren closed her eyes and prayed to be spirited back to Nate ’s office tower where there were n’t any hockey players , and there were n’t any reminders of the man who ’d almost made her dreams come true . But as long as Becca was unable to work , Lauren was stuck in Brooklyn . And now that the Bruisers had won their freaking play - offs slot , it meant a hailstorm of planning and administrative overtime . The NHL play - offs were not a quick affair , either . Four rounds of seven game series . It would be two months before the Stanley Cup winner was crowned . And there would be travel with the very people she ’d spent two years avoiding . “
117596	117605	117594	117594	Lauren	128	” Nate ’s voice cut through her reverie . “
117622	117623	117624	117624	Omigod	110	” “
117626	117632	117624	117624	Omigod	110	” Rebecca rolled her eyes . “
117653	117675	117648	117648	I	327	” But Nate gave Lauren a look over Becca ’s head . And that look said , get her a car . “
117680	117692	117648	117648	I	327	” Lauren sighed , taking a healthy slug of her champagne . “
117700	117724	117725	117725	You	1956	” She ’d dealt with transportation during the third period of the game , while everyone else was screaming encouragements toward the ice . “
117731	117742	117725	117725	You	1956	” She pulled her Katt Phone out of her bag . “
117760	117816	117817	117817	Pushy	313	” Nate gave her a thankful nod . Then he went over to the coat rack in the corner and fetched Becca ’s leopard - print jacket . He eased it onto her shoulders until Becca set down her empty wineglass and shoved her arms into the jacket , an irritated look on her face . “
117819	117854	117817	117817	Pushy	313	” she muttered under her breath . Lovesick , Lauren countered in her head . Did it make her a horrible person that she wanted to knock their heads together right now ? Probably . “
117861	117869	117859	117859	Nate	72	” Georgia said , clapping her hands . “
117881	118092	117859	117859	Nate	72	” She grabbed his suit jacket off a chair and herded him toward the door . The fact that their fearless leader was actually wearing a suit spoke of tonight ’s significance . Nate was a jeans - hoodie - and-800 - dollar - sneakers kind of guy , even on game night . Lauren followed her boss , the publicist , and Rebecca into the private elevator , wondering why she could n’t at least be happy for Nate . He ’d wanted this so badly . But all Lauren felt was dread for the next few weeks . And a healthy dose of anger , too . Bitter much ? Why yes , I still am . This was an unpleasant realization . Most of the time , Lauren was able to stay away from both hockey and Brooklyn . In Manhattan , she was able to focus on her excellent job , her tidy little Upper West Side apartment and the college degree she was just finishing up . She was too damn busy to feel bitter . But as the elevator slid lower , toward the locker rooms , so did her stomach . The doors parted momentarily on the main level for Becca ’s exit . “
118095	118105	118108	118108	babe	77	” Miss Perky called , stepping off the elevator . “
118110	118116	118108	118108	babe	77	” Georgia called after her . “
118125	118166	118120	118120	We	1958	” Do we ever . Becca gave them a cheeky salute and then walked away , while Nate watched , a worried look on his face . When the doors closed again , he finally gave his attention to Georgia . “
118183	118184	118174	118174	I	327	” “
118191	118195	118174	118174	I	327	” Georgia begged . “
118200	118204	118174	118174	I	327	” He smirked . “
118220	118229	118174	118174	I	327	” She rolled her eyes and he laughed . “
118253	118254	118255	118255	I	327	” “
118265	118269	118255	118255	I	327	” Georgia suggested . “
118277	118278	118272	118272	I	327	” “
118284	118288	118280	118280	you	1961	” Lauren interjected . “
118297	118301	118290	118290	you	1961	” Nate grinned . “
118309	118310	118290	118290	you	1961	” “
118329	118334	118314	118314	you	1961	” Lauren pointed out . “
118362	118386	118314	118314	you	1961	” Nate had refused to even consider travel plans before they were officially headed to the first round of the play - offs . “
118390	118394	118314	118314	you	1961	” he said . “
118405	118409	118410	118410	Coach	365	” he cautioned . “
118442	118443	118410	118410	Coach	365	” “
118447	118489	118410	118410	Coach	365	” Lauren said . She ’d done this all before , and not that many years ago . Although it felt like another lifetime . The doors parted once again , and Georgia put a hand on the boss ’s arm . “
118502	118532	118499	118499	we	1964	” An entire corridor full of reporters swung their lenses in Nate ’s direction . They began to shout questions as he made his way past their camera lenses . “
118539	118543	118499	118499	we	1964	” Georgia called . “
118549	118968	118499	118499	we	1964	” Nate led the way into their press room , which would be packed tonight . At the other end of the hall she spotted Coach Worthington and defenseman Patrick O’Doul . The team ’s captain was already showered and wearing his suit . The new publicist — Tommy — must have bribed the guy to get him camera - ready so fast . And he was smiling . O’Doul was not a smiler . The whole world was turned on its ear tonight . She followed her boss into the press conference where she spent the next half hour trying to appear joyful while avoiding eye contact with any of the players . Just another day at the office . * * * It was eleven o’clock before the room emptied again after speeches and Q & A. Lauren had reported to work fifteen hours ago already . That was life in professional sports . Now she faced a car ride home to midtown . At least there would be no traffic on the FDR . She ’d given away all the hired cars already , so Lauren found herself on the Flatbush Avenue sidewalk , tapping her Katt Phone to summon an Uber driver . The app gave her a four - minute wait . She used the time to compose a monster of a to do list for tomorrow . Not only did she need to play for the play - offs , but she needed to check in on the Manhattan office , making sure that the place was n’t going to seed in her absence . And at some point during this fiasco she ’d have to do a final revision of the senior thesis she was about to turn in . Thank God she ’d only had one course left before graduation , and her work was almost complete . If the Brooklyn Bruisers wrecked her odds for receiving her diploma this June , she would not be responsible for her actions . Nate would n’t let that happen , Lauren ’s conscience whispered . Her boss had made every possible accommodation these past two years as Lauren struggled to get her degree . Nate , for all his quirks , liked to see his people succeed . She was still mad at him , though , for asking this of her . The man knew exactly why she avoided the team , and he ’d put her in this position anyway . “
118971	119098	119099	119099	You	1969	” said a voice beside her . Startled , Lauren whirled to find the very reason for her misery standing there on the sidewalk , his rugged face regarding her curiously . Her stomach flipped over and then dove straight down to her knees . Mike Beacon in a suit had always been her undoing . His tie was loosened already , showing her a glimpse of the contrast between his olive skin at his throat and the crisp white dress shirt . A five o’clock shadow dusted the planes of his strong jaw , gathering in the sexy cleft of his chin . She used to put her thumb right there beneath his full lower lip as she tugged his face closer for a kiss . “
119102	119106	119099	119099	You	1969	” he asked . “
119111	119221	119099	119099	You	1969	” she insisted , snapping out of it . She tore her gaze off of the only man she ’d ever loved and looked up Flatbush for the Rav4 Uber had promised her . Every muscle in her body was tense as she waited for the goalie to just walk away . Which he did not do . She turned and pinned him with what the assistants in the Manhattan office termed the Lauren Glare . The laser like effect of her stare made interns put away their phones and get back to work . It seared incompetent messengers into delivering packages in a timely fashion . It was a “
119227	119241	119099	119099	You	1969	” according to her coworkers . Beacon just smiled . What an asshole . “
119248	119252	119099	119099	You	1969	” she asked . “
119264	119428	119099	119099	You	1969	” Seriously ? This from a man so obviously unconcerned with her wellbeing ? If he gave a damn , he would n’t have walked out on her two years ago without an explanation . He would n’t have tossed her heart on the street , stomped on it , and then vanished from her life . Forty - eight hours before she realized he was gone , they ’d been circling real - estate listings in the newspaper together , discussing whether they needed a three - bedroom apartment , or whether two would be plenty . While naked . In bed . Lauren did n’t need to remind him , though , because she ’d said it all before . For weeks she ’d sobbed into his voice mail because he did n’t pick up the phone . She ’d begged for an explanation , wondering what she ’d done wrong . There was really no point in going there again . “
119435	119440	119099	119099	You	1969	” she demanded instead . “
119445	119469	119099	119099	You	1969	” his husky voice asked . Oh , for christ ’s sake . She turned to face him , her blood pressure doubling . “
119505	119584	119585	119585	Nobody	393	” He swallowed , and she saw a flicker of a shadow cross his face , but it was gone before she could name the emotion . Note to self — never square off against a fricking goalie . They were the masters of playing it cool when they wanted to . Lauren found herself staring again , trying not to remember how easy it had been to get him to toss off the mask and really live . “
