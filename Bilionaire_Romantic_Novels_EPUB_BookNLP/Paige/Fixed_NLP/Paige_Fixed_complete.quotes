3204	3207	3208	3208	I	884	“ Exactly . ”

3562	3578	3558	3558	I	884	“ I would n’t throw yours away . I would n’t take yours at all . ”

3599	3603	3579	3579	His	884	“ Not necessarily . ”
3625	3629	3579	3579	His	884	“ Why then ? ”
3630	3645	3646	3646	I	884	“ Because you ’re looking for something temporary . Something fun to play with . ”
3667	3673	3646	3646	I	884	“ And I get attached . ”
3690	3700	3646	3646	I	884	“ Now does n’t that just scare you shitless ? ”
3721	3733	3714	3714	I	884	“ You , Alayna Withers , do anything but scare me . ”
3750	3758	3739	3739	he	884	“ Congratulations again . Quite an accomplishment . ”
3805	3814	3826	3826	she	166	“ Have you met the new owner yet ? ”
3884	3892	3893	3893	I	884	“ When would I have met him ? ”
3919	3933	3909	3909	Liesl	166	“ I do n’t know . You could have stopped by or something . ”
3965	3982	3960	3960	I	884	“ Nope . Actually , I spent most of the week at a spa near Poughkeepsie . ”
3983	3990	3991	3991	Liesl	166	“ Well , la de da ! ”
3997	4009	3991	3991	Liesl	166	“ Did you win the lotto when I was n’t looking ? ”
4010	4020	4021	4021	He	718	“ Hardly . It was a gift from Brian . ”
4073	4078	4079	4079	Liesl	166	“ How … nice . ”
4126	4164	4165	4165	I	884	“ Do n’t sound so shitty . It was nice . I did a bunch of crap I ’d never done before — horseback riding , rock climbing . Tons of spa treatments — feel my skin ! ”
4175	4184	4165	4165	I	884	“ My hands have never been this soft . ”
4185	4194	4165	4165	I	884	“ You ’re not kidding . Baby smooth . ”
4195	4216	4165	4165	I	884	“ It was good for me . Really . Exactly what I needed . Relaxing but still kept me preoccupied . ”
4217	4232	4233	4233	Her	721	“ Wow . Score one for Brian . Maybe he ’s finally growing up . ”
4237	4248	4233	4233	Her	721	“ And how was your time not at the spa ? ”
4291	4322	4323	4323	She	721	“ I ’m glad to be back , if that ’s what you ’re asking . And I may have four or five files of new ideas for the club . ”
4326	4336	4323	4323	She	721	“ Hey , at least that ’s healthy obsessing . ”
4341	4344	4337	4337	I	884	“ Healthyish . ”
4581	4585	4586	4586	Liesl	166	“ Whatcha thinking ? ”
4679	4688	4689	4689	I	884	“ Last time I worked , this guy — ”
4701	4727	4689	4689	I	884	“ This incredibly hot guy , actually — gave me a hundred dollars for three fingers of Macallan . Told me to keep the change . ”
4728	4741	4689	4689	I	884	“ And did he expect you to blow him after your shift ? ”
4742	4756	4689	4689	I	884	“ No . I thought that was what he was about , but … ”
4784	4796	4797	4797	I	884	“ I do n’t know . He left without trying anything . ”
4817	4823	4797	4797	I	884	“ It was … odd . ”
4824	4829	4797	4797	I	884	“ Midnight masturbation material ? ”
4830	4836	4797	4797	I	884	“ I ’ll never tell . ”
4837	4844	4797	4797	I	884	“ Your face says it all . ”
4948	4963	4928	4928	I	884	“ So the new owner … you’ve met him ? What ’s he like ? ”
4967	5049	4964	4964	Liesl	166	“ He ’s all right . Younger than you ’d imagine . Like , twenty - seven or twenty - eight . Fucking rich . He ’s insane about clean - up , though . We ’ve been calling him the Bar Nazi . He inspects everything , wiping his finger on the counters to make sure they ’re clean , like he ’s got OCD or something . Oh , and talk about masturbation material , he ’s psychotically hot . ”
5207	5214	5215	5215	Liesl	166	“ You ’ll meet him tonight . ”
5224	5251	5215	5215	Liesl	166	“ I guess he ’s a big deal in the business world . You ’ve probably heard of him — Houston Piers or something like that . ”
5256	5263	5264	5264	I	884	“ Do you mean Hudson Pierce ? ”
5270	5296	5297	5297	Hudson	1556	“ Liesl , Hudson Pierce is only the most successful business man under thirty in America . He ’s like a god in that world . ”
5337	5351	5352	5352	Liesl	166	“ You know I ’m not into all that Who ’s Who bullshit . ”
5369	5404	5352	5352	Liesl	166	“ Though I would n’t be surprised if he ’s on the Top Ten of , like , every Hottest - slash - Sexiest - slash - Most - Beautiful list in the world . ”
5482	5485	5486	5486	Liesl	166	“ Anyway , ”
5495	5518	5486	5486	Liesl	166	“ I think he ’s around . I saw him go into the offices earlier when you were grabbing napkins from storage . ”
6081	6086	6065	6065	David	180	“ This is Laynie . ”
6097	6106	6087	6087	I	884	“ Um , Alayna Withers , I mean . ”
6147	6151	6152	6152	Hudson	1556	“ Hudson Pierce . ”
6217	6227	6249	6249	He	180	“ Good to meet you properly , Ms. Withers . ”
6228	6231	6232	6232	I	884	“ Alayna , ”
6244	6248	6232	6232	I	884	“ Or Laynie . ”
6414	6428	6429	6429	He	761	“ I ’ve heard many things about you . And witnessed your work . ”
6450	6468	6429	6429	He	761	“ But none of what I heard or saw prepared me to find you wearing this ensemble . ”
6497	6501	6493	6493	I	884	“ Excuse me ? ”
6502	6522	6476	6476	I	884	“ I would think a graduate of Stern looking for a career in management would be more appropriately dressed . ”
6653	6666	6647	6648	Hot girls	764	“ What I ’m wearing is quite appropriate for a club staff . ”
6667	6675	6647	6648	Hot girls	764	“ Not for someone working toward manager . ”
6676	6688	6647	6648	Hot girls	764	“ Yes , even managers . Sex sells , Mr. Pierce . ”
6689	6707	6708	6708	His	761	“ Not at an elite club . Not at the kind of club I intend to run . ”
6730	6764	6718	6718	he	761	“ You must know that women have a difficult time in the business world . You need to work to be taken seriously , Alayna . Dress sexy , not like a floozy . ”
6967	6974	6975	6975	he	770	“ Um , yeah , Laynie , ”
6982	6987	6975	6975	he	770	“ Is that new ? ”
7090	7095	7081	7081	I	884	“ It is new . ”
7108	7115	7081	7081	I	884	“ I apologize . I misjudged . ”
7151	7162	7163	7163	Liesl	166	“ I ’ve got that lace pullover in my locker , ”
7166	7172	7163	7163	Liesl	166	“ It should tame you . ”
7173	7181	7182	7182	Liesl	166	“ Thanks . I ’ll take it . ”
7198	7211	7188	7188	she	166	“ Though , if you ask me , you look damn fine ! ”
7212	7221	7222	7222	Hudson	1556	“ Now that that ’s taken care of ... ”
7229	7240	7241	7241	David	180	“ I ’ve changed my mind about returning this weekend . ”
7255	7278	7246	7246	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ll be back tomorrow . I ca n’t be here until nine . Could you spare time for me then ? ”
7316	7320	7321	7321	David	180	“ Of course , ”
7344	7347	7348	7348	Hudson	1556	“ Good . ”
7360	7370	7348	7348	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , you ’ll be here as well . ”
7423	7428	7418	7418	I	884	“ Yes , sir . ”
7478	7481	7474	7474	he	180	“ Tomorrow . ”
7600	7605	7592	7592	I	884	“ What the fuck ? ”
7609	7647	7606	7606	David	180	“ I have no idea . I ’ve only met with Pierce once before today and we have n’t gotten much into anything besides me explaining our current business operations . He ’s certainly odd , though . ”
7648	7667	7606	7606	David	180	“ Well , what do you expect , growing up with all that wealth and pressure to succeed ? ”
7749	7770	7728	7728	I	884	“ I do n’t know what I ’m saying . I guess we ’ll just have to wait and see . ”
7771	7778	7780	7780	he	180	“ Do n’t worry , Laynie . ”
7822	7883	7819	7819	he	180	“ Pierce has too many high profile assets . He wo n’t want to spend too much of his time on the club . I ’m sure he ’ll let things run pretty much as is with maybe some minor finessing . And as long as I have a say in it , you ’ll have a more significant role . ”
7896	7905	7884	7884	David	180	“ Want to stay and help close tonight ? ”
7917	7924	7906	7906	His	180	“ I was counting on it . ”
8013	8041	8000	8000	David	180	“ Thank god you were behind the counter earlier . Who knows what else Hudson would have said about your outfit if he ’d seen those pants ? ”
8098	8114	8080	8080	he	180	“ Great . Now you ’re telling me I have to throw these out too ? ”
8115	8128	8129	8129	He	180	“ Well , just do n’t wear them while you ’re working . ”
8146	8151	8152	8152	he	180	“ For the record , ”
8161	8173	8152	8152	he	180	“ I do n’t disapprove of this outfit in the slightest . ”
8244	8256	8237	8237	I	884	“ Too bad your opinion is n’t the one that matters . ”
8262	8269	8257	8257	David	180	“ My opinion does n’t matter ? ”
8270	8273	8274	8274	I	884	“ Actually , ”
8284	8291	8274	8274	I	884	“ your opinion matters very much . ”
8296	8306	8292	8292	His	180	“ Then I think you look sexy as hell . ”
8451	8460	8446	8446	David	180	“ We need to stop this , Laynie . ”
8464	8472	8461	8461	I	884	“ What do you mean ? Why ? ”
8473	8487	8488	8488	He	180	“ Look , I like you . I really like you . But … ”
8504	8539	8496	8496	He	180	“ If you ’re serious about getting the management position , do you really think we should be messing around ? How would that look ? I ’m sure that Pierce would n’t approve . ”
8605	8612	8613	8613	I	884	“ We could keep it secret , ”
8638	8678	8613	8613	I	884	“ It does n’t have to be forever . But for now , especially when I ’m not sure what Pierce ’s plans are for me or for the club . I think we need to take a break . ”
8679	8682	8683	8683	I	884	“ Sure . ”
8896	8903	8904	8904	David	180	“ Are you okay , Laynie ? ”
9041	9061	9035	9035	I	884	“ Yeah . I ’m fine . If you ’re almost done , I ’m going to get changed . ”
9362	9373	9374	9374	she	817	“ David and hot owner boy are already in there , ”
9389	9409	9374	9374	she	817	“ Hudson told me to have you wait here . He ’ll let you know when he wants you . ”
9410	9422	9374	9374	she	817	“ Dammit ! I ’m not that late , am I ? ”
9423	9445	9374	9374	she	817	“ No , they went in there about ten minutes ago . They have no idea what time you got here . ”
9485	9491	9492	9492	Liesl	166	“ Hold on , Laynie , ”
9499	9505	9492	9492	Liesl	166	“ Let me see you . ”
9547	9556	9557	9557	Liesl	166	“ Fuck , girl , you look good ! ”
9581	9595	9571	9571	she	166	“ Thanks . I needed that . Especially after Mr. Disapproval last night . ”
9596	9608	9571	9571	she	166	“ He is now known as the Bar and Wardrobe Nazi . ”
9632	9655	9621	9621	Hudson	1556	“ Hey , you know he ’s the suit I was telling you about , the one who gave me the hundred . ”
9656	9662	9571	9571	she	166	“ You ’re shitting me ! ”
9663	9682	9621	9621	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m not . Do you think he wants me to blow him to get the promotion ? ”
9683	9693	9571	9571	she	166	“ Would it be that bad if he did ? ”
9694	9706	9621	9621	Hudson	1556	“ Yes . It would be utterly , wonderfully , horrible . ”
9897	9906	9907	9907	Liesl	166	“ God , I hope it picks up , ”
9920	9939	9911	9911	her	166	“ I ca n’t make it through a full shift at this pace . It ’s so boring ! ”
9940	9947	9948	9948	We	830	“ I hope so , too . ”
9992	9999	10000	10000	Liesl	166	“ What did you do today ? ”
10003	10018	10019	10019	Liesl	166	“ I worked on a PowerPoint presentation all morning . I crashed about two . ”
10024	10034	10019	10019	Liesl	166	“ You need more sleep than that , Laynie . ”
10035	10043	10044	10044	I	884	“ Nah . Five hours is plenty . ”
10338	10341	10342	10342	his	837	“ Alayna , ”
10351	10357	10342	10342	his	837	“ I ’ve got you . ”
10368	10375	10376	10376	David	180	“ Laynie , are you okay ? ”
10402	10405	10406	10406	I	884	“ Yeah , ”
10409	10418	10406	10406	I	884	“ I ’m , um , new shoes . ”
10429	10434	10419	10419	Hudson	1556	“ They ’re lovely . ”
10451	10456	10457	10457	I	884	“ Uh , thanks . ”
10486	10493	10494	10494	Hudson	1556	“ Sorry we kept you waiting . ”
10505	10517	10494	10494	Hudson	1556	“ I had a few things to discuss with David privately . ”
10518	10522	10523	10523	I	884	“ No problem . ”
10546	10573	10540	10540	I	884	“ I have so many ideas I ’d like to share about the club . I put them into a presentation . I brought my laptop . ”
10584	10603	10574	10574	Hudson	1556	“ How thoughtful . Set up a time with David . I ’m sure he ’s very interested . ”
10694	10701	10702	10702	David	180	“ How about tomorrow , Laynie ? ”
10705	10727	10702	10702	David	180	“ You ’re opening anyway . Why not come early ? Does six - thirty give you enough time to present ? ”
10728	10743	10744	10744	I	884	“ Yeah . I ’ll leave my laptop here if you do n’t mind . ”
10766	10796	10760	10760	He	180	“ David , could you lock this in the office ? I need to eat something . Alayna will join me . I ’ve reserved one of the bubbles . ”
10807	10818	10797	10797	His	180	“ Though it does n’t seem a reservation was required . ”
11284	11288	11271	11271	He	687	“ After you . ”
11315	11318	11310	11310	my	884	“ Fuck Me ”
11429	11439	11416	11416	He	687	“ I do n’t need this . Do you ? ”
11440	11449	11450	11450	I	884	“ No , thank you , Mr. Pierce . ”
11469	11472	11473	11473	he	687	“ Hudson , ”
11476	11484	11485	11485	His	687	“ No , thank you , Hudson . ”
11495	11501	11485	11485	His	687	“ I ’ve already eaten . ”
11502	11516	11485	11485	His	687	“ A drink then ? Though , I know you work at eleven . ”
11544	11550	11517	11517	I	884	“ Maybe an iced tea . ”
11551	11554	11537	11537	he	687	“ Good . ”
11619	11635	11637	11637	his	687	“ I did n’t mean to startle you . I was admiring your soft skin . ”
11643	11646	11651	11651	I	884	“ Oh . ”
11723	11727	11728	11728	he	687	“ Excuse me , ”
11748	11758	11728	11728	he	687	“ You can take it if you need to . ”
11824	11837	11820	11820	his	687	“ There ca n’t be anything important enough to interrupt this conversation . ”
11923	11952	11916	11916	He	687	“ I asked Liesl what you usually drank . If you had said you wanted something different , I would n’t look quite so cool at this moment . ”
11970	11985	11964	11964	he	687	“ Hmm , cool is not quite the word I ’d use for you . ”
12001	12011	11964	11964	he	687	“ What word would you use for me then ? ”
12033	12040	12027	12027	Sasha	167	“ Anything else , Mr. Pierce ? ”
12057	12062	12047	12047	he	687	“ We ’re good . ”
12099	12110	12095	12095	Hudson	1556	“ What word would you use for me , Alayna ? ”
12127	12130	12131	12131	I	884	“ Controlled , ”
12137	12140	12141	12141	He	687	“ Interesting . ”
12163	12192	12149	12149	I	884	“ Not that controlled is n’t an accurate description of me . But I had thought from the look on your face that you would say something else . ”
12364	12377	12337	12337	he	859	“ I know why you agreed to dine with me , Alayna . ”
12516	12539	12498	12498	Hudson	1556	“ I have to be honest with you . I do n’t intend to help you with your desire to make management . ”
12585	12596	12598	12598	Hudson	1556	“ That does n’t mean you wo n’t be promoted . ”
12621	12675	12612	12612	he	859	“ David said you ’re quite capable , and I ’m sure you ’ll get the position without my help . I may own The Sky Launch , but I am not your boss . David is your boss and will continue to be unless the business no longer thrives under his command . ”
12741	12754	12727	12727	Hudson	1556	“ But I did n’t invite you here to discuss the club . ”
12760	12767	12757	12757	I	884	“ Why did you invite me ? ”
12777	12783	12773	12773	Hudson	1556	“ Perhaps I like you . ”
12883	12890	12880	12880	I	884	“ Perhaps I ’m seeing someone . ”
12891	12915	12880	12880	I	884	“ You are n’t . No man would let his woman wear the outfit you wore yesterday . Not in public , anyway . ”
12940	12949	12929	12930	any man	680	“ Perhaps I ’m not into controlling boyfriends . ”
12955	12961	12962	12962	He	680	“ Very well , Alayna . ”
12967	12973	12962	12962	He	680	“ Are you seeing anyone ? ”
13042	13058	13029	13029	I	884	“ That is n’t why you invited me , Hudson . You have an agenda . ”
13059	13063	13064	13064	Hudson	1556	“ An agenda . ”
13080	13090	13064	13064	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , Alayna , I have an agenda . ”
13105	13118	13100	13100	he	680	“ I presume you enjoyed your time at my spa last week . ”
13135	13147	13127	13127	I	884	“ Oh , I did n’t realize you owned … wait ... ”
13154	13161	13127	13127	I	884	“ The gift was from you ? ”
13162	13172	13123	13123	he	680	“ Yes . Did you have a nice time ? ”
13173	13178	13179	13179	I	884	“ No . Way . ”
13194	13198	13123	13123	he	680	“ No way ? ”
13216	13257	13212	13212	I	884	“ I mean , yes , I had a nice time — a wonderful time , in fact — but no way could you have done that . Why did you do that ? You should n’t have done that . ”
13258	13263	13123	13123	he	680	“ Why ever not ? ”
13312	13318	13305	13305	I	884	“ Because that ’s big ! ”
13319	13324	13212	13212	I	884	“ Not for me . ”
13325	13332	13335	13335	he	869	“ But for me it is . ”
13355	13396	13335	13335	he	869	“ It ’s huge ! And you do n’t even know me ! It ’s completely inappropriate and unprofessional and unprecedented and inappropriate . And if I ’d known it was from you , I never would have accepted it . ”
13440	13462	13429	13429	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s not inappropriate at all . It was simply a gift . Think of it as a golden hello . ”
13478	13504	13468	13468	I	884	“ But you do n’t give gifts like that to women who work for you unless you ’re running an entirely different kind of club . ”
13505	13512	13463	13463	My	884	“ You ’re overreacting , Alayna . ”
13513	13518	13520	13520	his	884	“ I ’m not ! ”
13525	13543	13520	13520	his	884	“ And what do you mean a golden hello ? You mean , like a signing bonus ? ”
13576	13581	13582	13582	He	884	“ Yes , Alayna . ”
13590	13603	13582	13582	He	884	“ That ’s my agenda . I would like to hire you . ”
13641	13655	13633	13633	he	884	“ I already work for you and I ’m happy where I am . ”
13656	13693	13633	13633	he	884	“ Again , I do n’t feel that you do work for me . I am not your boss . I own the establishment that you work for . That is all . Is that clear ? ”
13722	13733	13734	13734	He	884	“ This would n’t affect your employment at the club . ”
13745	13777	13734	13734	He	884	“ Maybe hire is not the correct term . I ’d like to pay you to help me with a problem . I believe you ’d be perfect for the job . ”
13792	13806	13787	13787	he	884	“ You win . My curiosity is piqued . What ’s the job ? ”
13807	13817	13840	13840	Hudson	1556	“ I need you to break up an engagement . ”
13832	13839	13818	13818	I	884	“ Um , what ? Whose ? ”
13854	13857	13840	13840	Hudson	1556	“ Mine . ”
13873	13896	13860	13860	Hudson	1556	“ Close your mouth , Alayna . Although it ’s quite adorable to see you flabbergasted , it ’s also very distracting . ”
13965	13974	13975	13975	I	884	“ I did n’t realize you were engaged . ”
14031	14037	14038	14038	He	884	“ I ’m not really . ”
14053	14071	14038	14038	He	884	“ That ’s the problem . Neither Celia nor I are at all interested in the arrangement . ”
14089	14099	14111	14111	I	884	“ Then why not just break up with her ? ”
14103	14110	14100	14100	He	884	“ It ’s not that simple . ”
14134	14192	14111	14111	I	884	“ Her parents have been friends with mine for decades . They have a specific plan for their daughter ’s life and they do not accept her choice to not marry me . If she broke it off , they ’d cut her off emotionally and financially . That ’s not something I wish for my friend . ”
14237	14259	14221	14221	I	884	“ Never mind that parents should n’t be controlling their grown daughter , they do n’t control you . Do they ? ”
14265	14273	14260	14260	Hudson	1556	“ No . No one controls me . ”
14352	14358	14340	14340	I	884	“ I ’m missing something . ”
14362	14368	14359	14359	He	884	“ I suppose you are . ”
14401	14463	14464	14464	His	884	“ Alayna , if there is anyone in the world who has any power over me , it ’s my mother . My mother knows that I am … incapable … of love . She worries that I will … end up alone . A marriage with her best friend ’s daughter , at least , insures that wo n’t happen . ”
14486	14538	14483	14483	his	884	“ It would make my mother very happy to see me marry Celia . If it comes to Celia losing her entire life , then I ’ll willingly enter into a loveless marriage . However , I ’d hate to rob her future of happiness she might find with someone else . ”
14550	14557	14539	14539	I	884	“ Where would I come in ? ”
14563	14581	14558	14558	He	884	“ Ah , see , if Celia ’s parents believed I was in love with another woman — ”
14582	14600	14539	14539	I	884	“ They would n’t want her to marry a man who was in love with someone else . ”
14601	14629	14558	14558	He	884	“ Exactly . And my mother would be so thrilled that I ’d found someone I was happy with , she ’d stop worrying about my future . ”
14695	14710	14679	14679	I	884	“ So I ’m supposed to be the floozy you ’re in love with . ”
14718	14738	14711	14711	His	875	“ No one would ever mistake you as a floozy , Alayna . Even when you dress like one . ”
14780	14795	14777	14778	Hudson Pierce	1556	“ Why do n’t you hire a real floozy to put on your charade ? ”
14799	14829	14796	14796	He	875	“ My mother would never believe I ’d fall for a floozy . You , however , have particular qualities — qualities that would make the story quite believable . ”
14854	14860	14846	14846	I	884	“ What sort of qualities ? ”
14873	14886	14866	14866	I	884	“ You are exquisitely beautiful , Alayna , and also extremely intelligent . ”
14887	14890	14891	14891	I	884	“ Oh . ”
14933	14952	14926	14926	Hudson	1556	“ And you ’re a brunette . All three make you ‘ my type ’ so to say . ”
14988	15011	15012	15012	I	884	“ I sense your hesitation , Alayna , and I understand . Perhaps this would be a good time to discuss payment . ”
15056	15078	15053	15053	he	875	“ I understand you have a substantial amount of student loans . I ’d like to rid you of that debt . ”
15082	15091	15079	15079	I	884	“ That ’s way too much , Hudson . ”
15119	15124	15079	15079	I	884	“ Not to me . ”
15125	15131	15132	15132	I	884	“ It is for me . ”
15139	15146	15132	15132	I	884	“ It ’s eighty thousand dollars . ”
15147	15160	15079	15079	I	884	“ Eighty four thousand two hundred and six , to be exact . ”
15181	15224	15175	15175	he	875	“ I own the bank that holds your loans . I looked them up today . It would be very easy for me to have them written off . No actual money would exchange hands , if that makes you feel better . ”
15225	15233	15175	15175	he	875	“ That ’s an awfully generous payment . ”
15272	15287	15175	15175	he	875	“ It ’s worth it to me to see this project succeed , Alayna . ”
15335	15345	15322	15322	I	884	“ What exactly would you want me to do ? ”
15346	15387	15175	15175	he	875	“ Pretend we ’re a couple . I ’d invite you to several gatherings where my mother would see us together . I ’d expect you to hang on my arm and behave as though we ’re madly in love . ”
15388	15394	15322	15322	I	884	“ And that ’s all ? ”
15445	15450	15451	15451	His	875	“ That ’s all . ”
15512	15527	15505	15505	I	884	“ This pretend relationship — to what extent would I be expected to perform ? ”
15528	15542	15543	15543	His	875	“ Do n’t pussy foot about it . You ’re asking about sex . ”
15548	15568	15543	15543	His	875	“ I never pay for sex , Alayna . When I fuck you , it will be for free . ”
15656	15662	15649	15649	I	884	“ Maybe I should go . ”
15663	15669	15640	15640	his	875	“ Do you want to ? ”
15677	15685	15686	15686	I	884	“ I ’m n - not sure , ”
15689	15697	15686	15686	I	884	“ Yes . I think I should . ”
15723	15745	15708	15708	Hudson	1556	“ Because you ’re uncomfortable with my proposition ? Or because I told you that I ’m going to fuck you ? ”
15756	15763	15746	15746	His	875	“ I’m … yes . That . ”
15775	15816	15764	15764	He	875	“ But I‘m certain that ’s not a surprise to you , Alayna . You feel the electricity between us . Your body language expresses it quite well . I would n’t be surprised to find you ’re already wet . ”
15827	15842	15843	15843	He	875	“ Do n’t be embarrassed . Do n’t you know I feel the same ? ”
15849	15865	15843	15843	He	875	“ If you were to carefully read my body , you ’d see the evidence . ”
15921	15978	15913	15913	Hudson	1556	“ Let ’s table my proposition to hire you for a moment and discuss this other thing further . Please understand that they are very separate from each other . I ’d never want you to think my sexual desire for you was in any way part of a sham for my parents and their friends . ”
16010	16027	16003	16003	I	884	“ I’m — I do n’t know how to react to someone stating they desire me . ”
16043	16052	16028	16028	He	198	“ Has no man told you that before ? ”
16074	16089	16053	16053	I	884	“ Not in so many words . Actions sometimes . Certainly not so bluntly . ”
16090	16096	16097	16097	He	198	“ That ’s a shame . ”
16116	16127	16110	16110	his	198	“ I plan to tell you every chance I get . ”
16128	16131	16132	16132	I	884	“ Oh . ”
16235	16262	16224	16224	I	884	“ I , uh , I ’m feeling a bit overwhelmed . I need to go . You ’ve given me a lot to think about . ”
16270	16282	16283	16283	He	180	“ I wish you would n’t . But if you must … ”
16307	16316	16303	16303	I	884	“ I ’ve got to get to work . ”
16362	16367	16354	16354	He	180	“ Wait , Alayna . ”
16387	16440	16375	16375	I	884	“ I apologize for overwhelming you . That was n’t my intent . But I want you to know that whether or not you decide to help with my situation , I will continue to seduce you . I ’m a man who gets what he wants . And I want you . ”
16576	16584	16585	16585	he	180	“ I should have told you earlier , ”
16589	16613	16585	16585	he	180	“ You look absolutely beautiful tonight . I ca n’t keep my eyes off you . Serious and sexy wrapped into one package . ”
16629	16635	16585	16585	he	180	“ Kiss me , Alayna . ”
17011	17021	17002	17002	Hudson	1556	“ Not here , precious . Not like this . ”
17037	17056	17002	17002	Hudson	1556	“ I will have you beneath me . In a bed . Where I can adore you properly . ”
17200	17216	17217	17217	He	182	“ Now we have each other ’s numbers . I expect you to use it . ”
17243	17253	17226	17226	his	182	“ Call me when you ’re ready . Tomorrow . ”
17271	17273	17268	17268	I	884	“ ready ”
17997	18003	17994	17995	my brother	700	“ Be there in twenty . ”
18034	18051	18024	18024	he	182	“ Court cancelled . Taking a fast train to NYC . We need to have lunch . ”
18289	18296	18297	18297	Brian	1286	“ I ’m outside your building , ”
18300	18307	18315	18315	I	884	“ Hello to you , too . ”
18324	18344	18315	18315	I	884	“ Whatever , sassafrass . We have reservations in fifteen minutes at The Peacock Alley . Are you ready ? ”
18363	18384	18357	18357	him	1286	“ Already on my way down . You know , you could have used the apartment buzzer instead of calling . ”
18385	18398	18345	18345	I	884	“ But then you could n’t walk and talk like you are . ”
18399	18421	18422	18422	I	884	“ And I ’m about to lose you now as I get in the elevator . See you in a sec . ”
18455	18460	18461	18461	Brian	1286	“ There she is , ”
18553	18558	18559	18559	I	884	“ Hey , Bri , ”
18567	18575	18559	18559	I	884	“ It ’s good to see you . ”
18576	18580	18581	18581	He	1286	“ You too . ”
18591	18604	18581	18581	He	1286	“ You look terrible , Laynie . Like you need more sleep . ”
18605	18610	18611	18611	We	912	“ Gee , thanks . ”
18617	18635	18611	18611	We	912	“ I did n’t get off work until five . Yeah , I ’m a bit tired . ”
18636	18655	18581	18581	He	1286	“ Is n’t it time you started working a more normal job ? Something nine to five like ? ”
18656	18673	18611	18611	We	912	“ I work nine to five . Just not the same nine to five you work . ”
18739	18746	18714	18715	The man	1286	“ You know what I mean . ”
18790	18799	18773	18773	I	884	“ What brings you out here , Brian ? ”
18818	18841	18814	18814	He	1286	“ Ca n’t a brother come visit his only sister on a whim ? I still feel bad for missing your graduation . ”
18877	18889	18867	18867	we	912	“ You ’re a busy hotshot lawyer . I get it . ”
18890	18901	18902	18902	My	884	“ I sense the sarcasm in your voice , Laynie . ”
18921	18938	18941	18941	I	884	“ Okay , I was pissed you did n’t come . Does that make you happy ? ”
18964	18977	18958	18958	I	884	“ I ’m over it now , though , so forget it . ”
19181	19241	19176	19176	Brian	1286	“ Laynie , I ’m not here to catch up . I ’ve been doing a lot of thinking about our situation lately and have realized that you ’re a grown woman with an excellent education . It ’s time for you to assume more responsibility for yourself . I ’m not doing you a favor by enabling you . ”
19265	19267	19269	19269	me	884	“ enable ”
19327	19353	19316	19316	Brian	1286	“ I ca n’t let you throw your life away at a nightclub . You are too vulnerable to work in that type of establishment . ”
19389	19402	19385	19385	he	1286	“ I have n’t had any issues since I ’ve worked there . ”
19403	19421	19467	19467	His	884	“ You had school to keep you occupied . You need something more challenging to focus on . ”
19439	19466	19435	19435	I	884	“ Brian , I know how to handle my triggers . And what do you know about it ? You never went to any support meetings . ”
19477	19485	19467	19467	His	884	“ Because I ’m not your parent ! ”
19535	19544	19528	19528	he	1286	“ Look , Monica ’s having a baby . ”
19556	19559	19551	19551	I	884	“ Congratulations . ”
19560	19586	19587	19587	He	1286	“ I need to focus my energy and money on her and the baby . It ’s time for you to be grown - up . ”
19600	19610	19587	19587	He	1286	“ I ’m not paying for the apartment anymore . ”
19611	19635	19636	19636	I	884	“ But I ca n’t afford to pay for the apartment ! Not right now with my student loans about to be due . ”
19672	19684	19636	19636	I	884	“ Then maybe you better look for a better paying job . ”
19685	19693	19652	19652	he	1286	“ Brian , that ’s not fair . ”
19694	19712	19636	19636	I	884	“ Think about everything I ’ve been through with you and then talk to me about fair . ”
19725	19737	19738	19738	I	884	“ I have n’t had any problems in a long time , ”
19741	19748	19738	19738	I	884	“ You violated a restraining order . ”
19749	19755	19713	19713	He	1286	“ Over four years ago ! ”
19756	19770	19771	19771	His	1286	“ I ’m sorry , Laynie . I ca n’t support you anymore . ”
19919	19928	19896	19896	I	884	“ Thanks , Brian . Thanks for everything . ”
20241	20244	20245	20245	His	1286	“ Alayna . ”
20274	20281	20282	20282	I	884	“ Uh , hi , Hudson . ”
20285	20295	20296	20296	I	884	“ Is there something I can help you with ? ”
20345	20354	20332	20332	I	884	“ How did you know I was intelligent ? ”
20374	20380	20360	20360	I	884	“ What do you mean ? ”
20381	20387	20388	20388	I	884	“ You said I was … ”
20398	20403	20388	20388	I	884	“ Beautiful and intelligent — “
20408	20415	20404	20404	He	1286	“ Exquisitely beautiful and extremely intelligent . ”
20416	20421	20424	20424	them	935	“ Yeah , that . ”
20468	20486	20463	20463	I	884	“ But you ’ve barely talked to me . How do you know anything about my intelligence ? ”
20492	20504	20487	20487	He	1286	“ The graduate symposium at Stern . I saw you present . ”
20505	20508	20487	20487	He	1286	“ Oh . ”
20679	20690	20691	20691	His	945	“ Is that the only reason you called , Alayna ? ”
20703	20706	20691	20691	His	945	“ No . ”
20772	20787	20757	20757	I	884	“ Your proposition — I’d like to do it . I ’m saying yes . ”
20799	20811	20757	20757	I	884	“ Your offer to pay my student loans , I mean . ”
20837	20848	20822	20822	his	945	“ I ’m very happy to hear that , Alayna . ”
20873	20879	20870	20870	I	884	“ So what happens now ? ”
20880	20907	20866	20866	he	945	“ I have time in my schedule at four - thirty . Come to my office at Pierce Industries then and we ’ll finalize the details . ”
20930	20942	20925	20925	My	884	“ Sounds nice . I mean , good . Sounds good . ”
20946	20951	20943	20943	He	945	“ Goodbye , Alayna . ”
20952	20955	20956	20956	I	884	“ Bye . ”
21489	21493	21494	21495	the blonde	965	“ Miss Withers , ”
21505	21512	21494	21495	the blonde	965	“ He ’s ready for you . ”
21561	21566	21567	21567	she	965	“ Right through there , ”
21594	21600	21577	21577	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna . Come in . ”
21696	21701	21691	21691	I	884	“ Am I late ? ”
21702	21707	21708	21708	His	182	“ Not at all . ”
21726	21741	21716	21716	I	884	“ My last appointment finished earlier than I ’d anticipated . Have a seat . ”
21768	21771	21772	21772	I	884	“ Hmm , ”
21808	21821	21793	21793	his	182	“ Nice place . Not what I ’d pictured , but incredible . ”
21833	21839	21822	21822	Hudson	1556	“ You pictured my office ? ”
21867	21883	21860	21860	he	182	“ I thought you ’d be more traditional . But the modern really suits you . ”
21892	21927	21889	21889	his	182	“ Actually , I have a designer . I have no idea what ’s modern or contemporary or traditional . She showed me pictures of things she thought I ’d like and I nodded . ”
21980	21994	21976	21976	he	182	“ I hope you do n’t mind if we get to business first . ”
21995	22000	21970	21970	he	182	“ Of course not . ”
22037	22083	22084	22084	He	182	“ As I said earlier , I ’m very pleased that you ’ve accepted my offer . Before you officially agree , though , I want to make sure you understand exactly what I am asking of you . We tabled this discussion last night … ”
22110	22120	22105	22105	I	884	“ So I neglected to mention a key point . ”
22135	22212	22121	22121	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m a very high profile man , Alayna . Convincing my mother that we are a couple requires putting on a show for the world . That means you will be ‘ on duty ’ , so to say , at all times . When we are together around other people , we will play the happy couple . When we are n’t together , you must still act as though you ’re mine . ”
22237	22252	22219	22219	he	182	“ You ca n’t tell anyone that we are not really in a relationship . ”
22264	22271	22253	22253	I	884	“ I had n’t realized that . ”
22272	22280	22281	22281	He	182	“ No , I suspected as much . ”
22290	22296	22281	22281	He	182	“ Are you still interested ? ”
22383	22393	22497	22497	He	884	“ How long would we keep up the act ? ”
22394	22455	22497	22497	He	884	“ As long as we feel we can without imposing too much on our personal lives . The longer the better , obviously , but if my mother sees that I am capable of falling in love , she wo n’t try to press me into a loveless marriage , even if you and I have ‘ broken up . ’ ”
22456	22462	22497	22497	He	884	“ Are you still interested ? ”
22463	22496	22497	22497	He	884	“ It ’s eighty thousand dollars , Hudson . That ’s a drop in the bucket for you , but for me ... I understand if I have to work for it . ”
22502	22505	22497	22497	He	884	“ Good . ”
22514	22520	22525	22526	the receptionist	965	“ Yes , Mr. Pierce ? ”
22533	22542	22543	22543	Hudson	1556	“ Send him in , please , Patricia . ”
22642	22647	22648	22648	Hudson	1556	“ This is Jordan , ”
22663	22684	22660	22660	Jordan	655	“ He ’s been assigned to drive you to and from work and anywhere else you may need to go . ”
22724	22732	22721	22721	my	884	“ I do n’t need a driver . ”
22744	22753	22741	22741	I	884	“ I usually get my exercise running home . ”
22754	22776	22818	22818	I	884	“ Then he will drive you to work and follow you home when you run to make sure you arrive safely . ”
22787	22817	22818	22818	I	884	“ Alayna , my girlfriend would have a driver . She ’d also have a bodyguard . I ’m willing to forego the bodyguard if you use my driver . ”
22824	22828	22818	22818	I	884	“ All right . ”
22829	22851	22818	22818	I	884	“ He ’ll be waiting downstairs to take you to the club when we ’ve finished . Thank you , Jordan . ”
22873	22898	22852	22852	Jordan	655	“ And Alayna , wipe that look off your face . Jordan ’s gay . I would n’t have hired him for you otherwise . ”
22927	22931	22937	22937	him	985	“ Anything else ? ”
22965	22987	22939	22939	He	985	“ My mother is hosting a charity fashion show on Sunday . That will be our first outing as a couple . ”
22988	22991	22992	22992	I	884	“ Okay . ”
23057	23080	23030	23030	his	985	“ Your loans will be written off as of nine a.m. Monday morning . A written confirmation will be sent to you . ”
23081	23099	23100	23100	I	884	“ Do n’t you want to wait and see if we pull this whole thing off first ? ”
23132	23143	23144	23144	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m really not worried about it , Alayna . ”
23151	23168	23144	23144	Hudson	1556	“ But if you prefer , I ’ll postpone the write - off by one week . ”
23169	23182	23144	23144	Hudson	1556	“ Fine , whatever . Do I sign some agreement or something ? ”
23183	23196	23144	23144	Hudson	1556	“ I ’d rather there is n’t a paper trail on this . ”
23197	23208	23144	23144	Hudson	1556	“ But if anyone questioned my loans being paid off — “
23209	23219	23222	23222	he	985	“ I would pay off my girlfriend ’s loans . ”
23225	23237	23222	23222	he	985	“ And any other debt . Do you have other debt ? ”
23238	23241	23242	23242	I	884	“ No . ”
23260	23265	23251	23251	He	985	“ Is that all ? ”
23282	23290	23266	23266	Hudson	1556	“ Unless you have any other questions . ”
23302	23324	23297	23297	I	884	“ When we ’re together , in public , I mean , I can hold your hand and … kiss you ? ”
23342	23350	23338	23338	his	985	“ I expect you to . Often . ”
23355	23359	23338	23338	his	985	“ Anything else ? ”
23374	23377	23365	23365	I	884	“ No . ”
23378	23389	23390	23390	He	985	“ Then the business portion of this meeting is done . ”
23490	23518	23480	23480	he	985	“ In about two minutes , Alayna , I ’m going to come around this desk and kiss you until you ’re wet and gasping for air . ”
23523	23601	23480	23480	he	985	“ But first , let me clear up one thing that I suspect may be an issue . This charade is mostly about me convincing my mother . I will be saying and doing things — romantic things , perhaps — that are not genuine . I need you to remember that . Out of the public eye , I will seduce you . That will be genuine , but it can never be misconstrued as love . ”
23602	23610	23611	23611	My	884	“ Because you ’re incapable of love . ”
23618	23621	23611	23611	My	884	“ Yes . ”
23629	23636	23622	23622	Curiosity	207	“ Why do you believe that ? ”
23650	23690	23637	23637	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m twenty - nine years old and have never had any inclination toward a woman other than to have her in my bed . I do n’t do romantic relationships . I ’m married to my work . ”
23700	23712	23691	23691	He	884	“ That , and casual sex , are what fulfill me . ”
23927	23936	23920	23920	I	884	“ No romance ? I can do that . ”
23958	23966	23948	23948	He	379	“ Are you also incapable of love ? ”
23984	24008	23967	23967	I	884	“ No , just the opposite . I love too much . Keeping love out of the equation is a very good thing . ”
24009	24015	24016	24016	He	379	“ Good . No love . ”
24090	24093	24082	24082	His	379	“ Wait . ”
24094	24099	24101	24101	he	379	“ I ca n’t . ”
24104	24107	24101	24101	he	379	“ What ? ”
24130	24141	24108	24108	He	379	“ Why me ? You could have anyone you want . ”
24142	24149	24150	24150	He	379	“ Awesome . I want you . ”
24166	24169	24108	24108	He	379	“ Why ? ”
24185	24195	24196	24196	His	379	“ I do n’t know . I just do . ”
24218	24226	24227	24227	He	379	“ From the moment I saw you ... ”
24502	24506	24507	24507	he	379	“ The intercom , ”
24524	24527	24514	24514	He	379	“ Yes ? ”
24538	24555	24528	24529	The secretary	379	“ I ’m about to leave , Mr. Pierce . Is there anything else you need ? ”
24556	24568	24569	24569	He	379	“ No , thank you , Patricia . You may go . ”
24639	24642	24632	24632	I	884	“ What ? ”
24648	24651	24643	24643	He	379	“ Nothing . ”
24667	24672	24652	24652	He	379	“ Come , Alayna . ”
24864	24873	24850	24850	He	379	“ Can I get you some iced tea ? ”
24874	24877	24881	24881	he	379	“ Sure . ”
24912	24917	24896	24896	I	884	“ You live here ? ”
24938	24953	24918	24918	He	379	“ Sometimes I stay here . But I do n’t consider it my home . ”
24965	24974	24954	24954	I	884	“ Hudson ! Is this your fuck pad ? ”
24975	24978	24979	24979	He	379	“ Sometimes . ”
25015	25024	25025	25025	He	379	“ And you brought me here because ... ? ”
25043	25053	25038	25038	He	379	“ Why do you think I brought you here ? ”
25087	25100	25076	25076	I	884	“ Um , I have to leave for work in ten minutes . ”
25101	25110	25074	25074	I	884	“ Twenty minutes . You have a driver . ”
25124	25135	25111	25111	I	884	“ That ’s still not a whole lot of time . ”
25155	25165	25136	25136	Hudson	1556	“ Not a whole lot of time for what ? ”
25181	25191	25176	25176	I	884	“ Are you going to make me say it ? ”
25207	25249	25192	25192	He	379	“ No . Not now . If you say it I wo n’t be able to resist you , and , as you said , there ’s not enough time . So instead I ’ll have to settle for a sample . ”
25596	25626	25590	25590	He	680	“ Christ , Alayna , you ’re wet . Ah , so wet . You ’re driving me crazy with your sounds and how wet you are for me . ”
25689	25697	25682	25682	Hudson	1556	“ God , you come so easily . ”
25708	25718	25698	25698	His	680	“ I have to make you do that again . ”
25729	25738	25739	25739	he	680	“ Lean your elbows back on the counter , ”
25798	25801	25802	25802	I	884	“ Fuck ! ”
25984	26008	25968	25968	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re so sexy , precious . So fucking sexy and soon I ’m going to come with you just like that . ”
26018	26021	26022	26022	he	680	“ Soon , ”
26025	26029	26022	26022	he	680	“ And often . ”
26080	26084	26085	26085	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
26140	26145	26136	26136	he	680	“ You ’re welcome . ”
26243	26252	26253	26253	I	884	“ My panties are , um , soaked . ”
26260	26267	26253	26253	I	884	“ I ca n’t wear them . ”
26274	26288	26253	26253	I	884	“ You ca n’t work without them . Your dress is too short . ”
26289	26300	26253	26253	I	884	“ I ’ll be careful . I do n’t mind . ”
26301	26305	26306	26306	Hudson	1556	“ I do . ”
26318	26357	26358	26358	He	680	“ Alayna , you not wearing panties is very sexy . When I ’m with you . I definitely do n’t think it ’s sexy knowing you ’re bare and surrounded by a bunch of grabby drunk customers . ”
26371	26381	26358	26358	He	680	“ In fact , it makes me very unhappy . ”
26432	26440	26427	26427	I	884	“ I can take care of myself . ”
26453	26486	26449	26449	I	884	“ I ’m not putting on soaking wet panties . I ’ll smell like sex all night and let me tell you what that does to a bunch of grabby drunk customers . ”
26490	26503	26487	26487	He	680	“ Leave them then . I can at least have them laundered . ”
26512	26526	26504	26504	I	884	“ If you wanted a memento all you had to do was ask . ”
26536	26555	26556	26556	He	680	“ I ’m not keeping them . Excuse me a moment and I ’ll be ready to go . ”
26567	26577	26578	26578	I	884	“ You ’ll be ‘ ready to go ? ’ ”
26610	26616	26617	26617	he	680	“ Did you say something ? ”
26679	26691	26667	26667	he	680	“ I had n’t realized you were going to the club . ”
26692	26696	26697	26697	He	680	“ I am . ”
26739	26745	26727	26727	He	680	“ Is that a problem ? ”
26833	26852	26830	26830	I	884	“ Why did you have me meet you here when you could have met me at the club ? ”
26853	26875	26880	26880	he	680	“ Privacy , Alayna . I ca n’t imagine you would want to experience that at the club , would you ? ”
26887	26893	26880	26880	he	680	“ Do you regret coming ? ”
26907	26910	26911	26911	I	884	“ No , ”
26921	26928	26915	26915	he	680	“ I regret you not coming . ”
26965	26974	26992	26992	his	655	“ You ’ll have opportunities to rectify that . ”
27049	27072	27042	27042	his	655	“ Just after all your talk about not being my boss and all that , I did n’t think you ’d show . ”
27073	27084	27085	27085	He	655	“ David may want advice . I should be there . ”
27091	27105	27085	27085	He	655	“ Also , I ’m curious . Is that going to bother you ? ”
27106	27116	27042	27042	his	655	“ I was n’t prepared . That ’s all . ”
27123	27128	27117	27117	His	655	“ You ’re nervous . ”
27129	27132	27085	27085	He	655	“ Yes . ”
27144	27158	27133	27133	He	655	“ Do n’t be . You ’re perfect . You ’ll be perfect . ”
27250	27255	27242	27242	David	180	“ Could we … ? ”
27269	27283	27242	27242	David	180	“ Do we have to , um , do the pretend thing today ? ”
27284	27304	27242	27242	David	180	“ You do n’t want David to give you extra points because he thinks you ’re dating his boss . ”
27305	27308	27315	27315	David	180	“ Right . ”
27340	27358	27331	27331	David	180	“ We can keep it under wraps for a day or two , if you ’d rather . ”
27359	27362	27331	27331	David	180	“ Thanks . ”
27438	27449	27450	27450	he	1286	“ You know what they say to do about nervousness , ”
27456	27462	27450	27450	he	1286	” Imagine your audience naked . ”
27468	27473	27463	27463	I	884	“ You and David ? ”
27474	27487	27488	27488	Hudson	1556	“ No , precious . Just me . That ’s an order . ”
27733	27736	27737	27737	he	180	“ Hey , ”
27742	27755	27737	27737	he	180	“ Are you ready to show off those brilliant brains of yours ? ”
27783	27788	27773	27773	I	884	“ Should I start ? ”
27789	27806	27821	27821	his	180	“ No , Pierce said he might come . You should give him a few minutes . ”
27813	27816	27817	27817	he	180	“ David , ”
27824	27827	27828	27828	He	180	“ Alayna . ”
28085	28111	28079	28079	he	180	“ David , I have some place I need to be now . You can call me tomorrow if you want to discuss these ideas . ”
28221	28224	28225	28225	David	180	“ Thanks , ”
28228	28233	28225	28225	David	180	“ Great . Alayna ? ”
28234	28237	28238	28238	I	884	“ What ? ”
28253	28260	28243	28243	Hudson	1556	“ Walk me out , please . ”
28348	28351	28352	28352	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , ”
28378	28388	28371	28371	His	180	“ You were brilliant , do you know that ? ”
28389	28392	28393	28393	My	884	“ No . ”
28408	28427	28428	28428	I	884	“ I mean , I thought my ideas were good , but then you did n’t say anything … ”
28441	28453	28454	28454	He	180	“ I could n’t . I was too fucking turned on . ”
28482	28488	28472	28472	His	180	“ Then it was good ? ”
28489	28501	28502	28502	He	180	“ Oh , precious , do you really have to ask ? ”
28510	28522	28502	28502	He	180	“ You think smart — practical and yet outside the box . ”
28530	28538	28523	28523	He	180	“ And it drives me fucking crazy . ”
28583	28592	28570	28570	Hudson	1556	“ So Hudson Pierce is into nerdy girls . ”
28604	28628	28593	28593	He	180	“ I ’m into you — when you ’re nerdy , when you ’re flustered , when you ’re whimpering under my tongue . ”
28694	28702	28677	28677	he	180	“ I ’m into you , too . ”
28775	28786	28770	28770	His	180	“ During your presentation — did you picture me naked ? ”
28792	28809	28789	28789	I	884	“ I did n’t have enough to go on . I have n’t seen ya naked . ”
28810	28826	28827	28827	He	180	“ I have n’t seen you naked and that does n’t stop me from picturing . ”
28859	28874	28846	28846	His	180	“ So when are we going to remedy all the seeing of naked bits ? ”
28883	28898	28875	28875	Hudson	1556	“ Ah , now she ’s eager . After she ’s sampled the goods . ”
28899	28910	28911	28911	I	884	“ I was always eager . Now I ’m sure . ”
28926	28934	28875	28875	Hudson	1556	“ What time do you work tomorrow ? ”
28935	28938	28875	28875	Hudson	1556	“ Nine . ”
28949	28962	28963	28963	he	180	“ I ’ll make sure I ’m done with work by five , ”
28967	29003	28963	28963	he	180	“ Come by the loft then . Take the main elevator to the penthouse . You ’ll have to enter the code : Seven - three - two - three . Repeat it for me . ”
29004	29013	28963	28963	he	180	“ Seven - three - two - three . ”
29014	29041	29042	29042	He	180	“ Good . I ’ll text it to you so you do n’t forget . Five o’clock . Do n’t eat . I ’ll feed you . ”
29056	29064	29065	29065	He	180	“ And I ’ll feed on you . ”
29082	29087	29073	29073	He	180	“ Tomorrow , precious . ”
29116	29135	29112	29112	he	180	“ Oh , and I assure you , bits is not an appropriate word for my naked parts . ”
29165	29168	29169	29169	she	166	“ Laynie , ”
29181	29199	29169	29169	she	166	“ Hot Stuff left that for you while you were pulling the cash drawers from the office . ”
29205	29213	29200	29200	I	884	“ Hot stuff ? You mean Hudson ? ”
29214	29217	29218	29218	I	884	“ Yeah . ”
29350	29358	29359	29359	Liesl	166	“ So what the fuck , Laynie ? ”
29369	29385	29387	29387	I	884	“ It ’s nothing . I left something when I was at his office earlier . ”
29412	29434	29409	29409	she	1051	“ You left your panties at Hudson ’s office ? Yeah , I looked . What did you expect from me ? ”
29509	29523	29503	29503	I	884	“ Liesl , I promise I ’ll tell you . Just not tonight . ”
29533	29551	29524	29524	She	1051	“ Fine , whatever . But you better have juicy details when you ’re ready to spill . ”
29552	29555	29556	29556	I	884	“ Deal , ”
29977	29992	29993	29993	Lauren	166	“ Well , there ’s a sight I have n’t seen in a while , ”
30016	30025	30006	30006	her	166	“ Should I be concerned to see you ? ”
30026	30041	30006	30006	her	166	“ I do n’t know yet . Do you have any time to talk ? ”
30042	30057	30006	30006	her	166	“ A bit . Wanna grab a cup of coffee at the corner café ? ”
30058	30061	30006	30006	her	166	“ Yeah . ”
30124	30135	30136	30136	Lauren	166	“ Will you be okay without the help from Brian ? ”
30186	30189	30190	30190	I	884	“ Maybe , ”
30196	30224	30190	30190	I	884	“ I think so . Brian has n’t been much help with any of my crap except financially . And I ’ve gotten the money worked out . ”
30225	30243	30273	30273	I	884	“ You have ? That ’s great . I ’m sensing a ‘ but , ’ though . ”
30244	30251	30190	30190	I	884	“ But there ’s a guy . ”
30252	30256	30257	30257	She	166	“ Mm hmm . ”
30268	30272	30257	30257	She	166	“ Go on . ”
30313	30327	30297	30297	I	884	“ We work together . And I ca n’t stop thinking about him . ”
30328	30333	30347	30348	the group	1068	“ Is it David ? ”
30382	30388	30370	30370	he	180	“ It ’s someone else . ”
30394	30405	30389	30389	Lauren	166	“ What sort of thoughts are you having about him ? ”
30406	30409	30410	30410	I	884	“ Fantasies . ”
30419	30423	30410	30410	I	884	“ Sexual fantasies . ”
30424	30428	30389	30389	Lauren	166	“ What else ? ”
30429	30434	30410	30410	I	884	“ That ’s it . ”
30440	30464	30435	30435	Lauren	166	“ You ’re not going to get me to say you ’re having problems because you ’re thinking kinky about a hot guy . ”
30465	30502	30389	30389	Lauren	166	“ But it ’s all the time . I mean , I wake up thinking about him , I go to sleep thinking about him , I ’m tending bar and I ’m thinking about him . ”
30503	30517	30435	30435	Lauren	166	“ But no stalking or calling him at work or emailing him incessantly ? ”
30518	30521	30389	30389	Lauren	166	“ No . ”
30522	30527	30435	30435	Lauren	166	“ Only sexual thoughts ? ”
30528	30552	30389	30389	Lauren	166	“ No , I replay things he ’s said to me in my head . I wonder what he ’s doing and thinking . ”
30553	30563	30435	30435	Lauren	166	“ Have you considered you might just like him ? ”
30623	30632	30633	30633	I	884	“ Lauren , I ca n’t like him , ”
30636	30646	30633	30633	I	884	“ We … there ’s no chance with him . ”
30647	30652	30662	30662	She	1071	“ Are you sure ? ”
30653	30661	30633	30633	I	884	“ Yes . We ’ve discussed it . ”
30678	30685	30686	30686	I	884	“ He does n’t do romance , ”
30689	30748	30686	30686	I	884	“ Lots of women get the hots for men that are unattainable . It ’s natural . It does n’t mean you ’re falling backwards . Stay realistic about the situation . If you feel he ’s consuming your thoughts to the point that it ’s affecting your daily routine , then you need to seek some help . ”
30749	30760	30762	30762	she	1071	“ So would sleeping with him be a bad idea ? ”
30791	30795	30762	30762	she	1071	“ Have you ? ”
30796	30800	30783	30783	Hudson	1556	“ Not yet . ”
30807	30850	30801	30801	Lauren	166	“ But you ’re planning on it , right ? Now , girl , sex with no intention of a relationship opens up a whole other host of problems that have nothing to do with addiction but certainly can add to it . ”
30851	30860	30762	30762	she	1071	“ Is it impossible to have meaningless sex ? ”
30861	30908	30801	30801	Lauren	166	“ I ’m sure it ’s possible , I just do n’t know very many people who get away with it . And I do n’t mean to imply that you ’re not strong enough to deal with it , but , honey , are you ? ”
30909	30918	30762	30762	she	1071	“ It might get rid of the fantasies . ”
30919	30930	30801	30801	Lauren	166	“ Maybe . It also might make you latch on . ”
30931	30962	30762	30762	she	1071	“ Not to sound like a slut , Lauren , but I ’ve had quite a few one - night flings in the last few years with no attachment issues . ”
30963	30999	30801	30801	Lauren	166	“ Then maybe you ’ll be fine . But your one - night things work because you do n’t see the guy every day after . You ’ll still see this guy after , right ? ”
31031	31034	31024	31024	I	884	” Occasionally . ”
31110	31180	31107	31107	she	166	“ I ca n’t tell you what to do , Laynie . And I ca n’t tell you that sleeping with this guy or not sleeping with this guy will make any difference in whether you do or do n’t fall into obsessive patterns . What I can do is be there for you and suggest that you come back to group for a while for some extra support . ”
31339	31366	31330	31330	he	655	“ Roger , I do n’t want to hear that we lost this company because my staff was n’t able to foresee the possibility of separation . ”
31376	31380	31381	31381	he	655	“ Come in , ”
31539	31559	31560	31560	He	655	“ Take care of it , Roger . I expect this to be resolved before I arrive on Monday . ”
31586	31589	31590	31590	I	884	“ Hi , ”
31785	31801	31779	31779	he	655	“ Jesus , Alayna . I want you so bad , I ’m not behaving . ”
31802	31805	31806	31806	I	884	“ Hudson , ”
31816	31827	31806	31806	I	884	“ If this is misbehaving , please do n’t stop . ”
31862	31889	31859	31859	He	655	“ At least let me take you to a bed . If you keep this up , I ’m going to fuck you against the door . ”
31890	31903	31904	31904	I	884	“ That does n’t sound like the worst thing in the world , ”
31918	31925	31926	31926	He	655	“ No , it does n’t . ”
31949	31967	31941	31941	He	655	“ But I wo n’t be able to savor you properly and I ’ll forever regret it . ”
32031	32048	32049	32049	He	655	“ I imagined you ’d have beautiful breasts , Alayna . But I had no idea … ”
32175	32191	32167	32167	he	655	“ You ’re so responsive . I could spend all day sucking your gorgeous tits . ”
32201	32212	32192	32192	He	655	“ But there ’s so much of you to adore . ”
32237	32241	32242	32242	I	884	“ My shoes , ”
32251	32256	32257	32257	He	655	“ I love them . ”
32267	32283	32257	32257	He	655	“ I want them digging into my back when you wrap your legs around me . ”
32318	32324	32325	32325	I	884	“ Lean on your elbows . ”
32365	32380	32351	32351	He	655	“ You ’re so fucking sexy like this . All spread out for me . ”
32395	32407	32351	32351	He	655	“ You want me . Look how your pretty pussy throbs . ”
32484	32487	32488	32488	he	655	“ Again , ”
32656	32663	32664	32664	he	655	“ You ’re ready for me , ”
32686	32691	32692	32692	he	655	“ Jesus , Alayna , ”
32695	32702	32692	32692	he	655	“ You feel so goddamn good . ”
32810	32814	32801	32801	He	655	“ So good . ”
32939	32946	32947	32947	Hudson	1556	“ Wrap your legs around me , ”
33043	33050	33051	33051	I	884	“ I ’m going to come , ”
33057	33060	33061	33061	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , ”
33064	33071	33061	33061	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , come , Alayna . ”
33146	33157	33158	33158	he	655	“ I knew sex with you would be like that , ”
33167	33179	33158	33158	he	655	“ Powerful and intense and fucking incredible . I knew it . ”
33196	33201	33180	33180	I	884	“ Me , too . ”
33226	33231	33232	33232	he	655	“ Sleep , precious , ”
33283	33293	33275	33275	He	655	“ I need to order dinner . Chinese okay ? ”
33297	33301	33294	33294	I	884	“ Sounds delicious . ”
33302	33309	33275	33275	He	655	“ I ’ll call it in . ”
33524	33530	33531	33531	I	884	“ You ’re getting dressed ? ”
33620	33629	33615	33615	He	1090	“ Are you in a hurry to leave ? ”
33679	33692	33671	33671	We	1092	“ Guys do n’t usually want me to hang around after sex . ”
33693	33712	33713	33713	He	1090	“ That statement brings up so many issues for discussion that I do n’t know where to begin . ”
33718	33728	33729	33729	He	1090	“ What is wrong with men to not … ? ”
33734	33783	33729	33729	He	1090	“ Alayna , please do n’t group me with other guys you know . I ’d like to think I ’m not like most of them . And I do n’t want to know or think about you having sex with other men . I do n’t share . ”
33812	33828	33789	33789	I	884	“ That sounds awfully relationshippy to me . I thought you did n’t do relationships . ”
33829	33852	33807	33807	his	1090	“ I do n’t do romantic relationships . Sexual relationships are another thing entirely . Why are you getting ready to leave ? ”
33876	33879	33880	33880	he	1090	“ Stop , ”
33919	33943	33908	33908	His	1090	“ I want you to stay . And , if you are so inclined , I ’d prefer that you not be dressed . ”
33959	33964	33965	33965	I	884	“ You ’re dressed , ”
34004	34029	33978	33980	a pouty child	1093	“ As soon as the food ’s here , I ’ll be happy to lose the clothing . Would that make you feel better ? ”
34030	34033	34037	34037	my	884	“ Yes . ”
34067	34073	34074	34074	I	884	“ I do n’t know , ”
34091	34114	34082	34082	he	1090	“ What ’s going on inside your head , precious ? Are you going to run off every time we have sex ? ”
34218	34237	34214	34214	I	884	“ I had n’t really thought this would be more than a one - time thing , Hudson . ”
34248	34251	34238	34238	He	1090	“ Alayna . ”
34276	34295	34268	34268	I	884	“ If you do n’t want to have sex with me again , you need to tell me . ”
34296	34300	34301	34301	His	1090	“ I do ! ”
34317	34321	34322	34322	I	884	“ I do , ”
34398	34403	34404	34404	His	1090	“ What is it ? ”
34422	34426	34409	34409	He	1090	“ Tell me . ”
34460	34477	34458	34458	men	714	“ I ’m not good at relationships . Of any sort . I have … issues . ”
34502	34506	34507	34507	Hudson	1556	“ Like what ? ”
34518	34530	34507	34507	Hudson	1556	“ Does this have anything to do with that restraining order ? ”
34543	34549	34538	34538	I	884	“ You know about that ? ”
34603	34613	34584	34584	I	884	“ Oh , god , I ’m so embarrassed ! ”
34682	34715	34670	34670	he	1286	“ I know intimate things about you , precious — the way you look and the sounds you make when you ’re about to come — and you ’re concerned about this ? ”
34764	34788	34789	34789	I	884	“ It was a big deal . The biggest deal . Like my biggest secret . I thought my brother had buried it . ”
34801	34821	34789	34789	I	884	“ And are you saying I should be embarrassed about how I look and sound when … you know ? ”
34822	34856	34857	34857	He	1286	“ I needed to know anything that might come up about my pretend girlfriend . It was n’t necessarily easy to find , but not incredibly hard . It ’s been buried now . ”
34867	34892	34893	34893	He	1286	“ And never , never be ashamed of how you look or sound at any time , especially when you ’re about to come . ”
34900	34913	34893	34893	He	1286	“ I ’m honored to be acquainted with you in that way . ”
34914	34919	34920	34920	I	884	“ I ’m mortified . ”
34935	34955	34920	34920	I	884	“ About the restraining order , I mean . I do n’t know how to react to the other . ”
34956	34959	34960	34960	He	1286	“ Why ? ”
35012	35027	35007	35007	I	884	“ Because it makes me feel all weird and tingly . And turned on . ”
35028	35031	35032	35032	He	1286	“ Fantastic . ”
35035	35045	35032	35032	He	1286	“ But I meant , why are you mortified ? ”
35046	35049	35050	35050	I	884	“ Oh . ”
35099	35136	35092	35092	I	884	“ Because it ’s evidence of my crazy . You know , when I said I love too much ? The restraining order is part of that , and I like to pretend it never happened . ”
35137	35143	35144	35144	He	1286	“ Then it never did . ”
35149	35168	35169	35169	He	1286	“ We ’ve all done insane things in the past . I ’d never hold it against you . ”
35181	35199	35169	35169	He	1286	“ Just another reason romantic love holds no interest for me . People get crazy with it . ”
35209	35234	35201	35201	he	1286	“ But going back to the heart of this conversation — why does that have a bearing on a relationship between you and me ? ”
35249	35260	35261	35261	He	1286	“ I freaked out , Hudson . About a guy . ”
35274	35291	35261	35261	He	1286	“ Several guys , actually , but it was the last one that ended not well . ”
35303	35319	35292	35292	He	1286	“ And do you think you ’re going to ‘ freak out ’ about me ? ”
35329	35373	35320	35320	I	884	“ I really ca n’t honestly tell you . I ’ve stayed away from any relationships for a while so I would n’t have to deal with it . Trying to have something now with you — it ’s uncharted territory for me . ”
35458	35486	35487	35487	I	884	“ I have n’t freaked out so far . With you . And I do n’t want to not have sex with you again . I mean … ”
35509	35547	35497	35497	He	1286	“ You ’re adorable when you ’re flustered . I do n’t want to not have sex with you again either . So we wo n’t do that . We ’ll have tons of incredible sex instead . ”
35557	35566	35548	35548	I	884	“ I ’m not saying yes , yet . ”
35572	35584	35570	35570	I	884	“ I have to take this one day at a time . ”
35613	35644	35645	35645	He	1286	“ Alayna , you might have to take this one day at a time , but I already know there will be tons of fucking between the two of us . ”
35661	35681	35651	35651	I	884	“ In fact , I ’m going to have to be inside you again before you leave for work . ”
35713	35718	35706	35706	I	884	“ Like right now ? ”
35742	35754	35738	35738	he	1286	“ Not right now , precious . Dinner ’s almost he — ”
35784	35792	35772	35772	he	1286	“ But your enthusiasm is super hot . ”
35901	35913	35887	35887	He	1286	“ If you have to be dressed , I completely approve . ”
35921	35944	35918	35918	I	884	“ Well , thank you very much , Mr. Pierce . I do n’t know what I ’d do without your approval . ”
35953	35963	35945	35945	He	1286	“ Should I undress ? I said I would . ”
35964	35991	35918	35918	I	884	“ Not if you want me to actually eat . I ’d be much too distracted . And I already have a hard time with chopsticks . ”
36003	36012	35992	35992	Hudson	1556	“ Do you need me to feed you ? ”
36013	36018	35992	35992	Hudson	1556	“ Hmm . Maybe . ”
36084	36091	36092	36092	Hudson	1556	“ What are you doing tomorrow ? ”
36107	36114	36092	36092	Hudson	1556	“ Before work , I mean . ”
36134	36175	36122	36122	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m off work at three tonight . Or tomorrow morning , however you want to look at it . I ’ll probably sleep a good part of the day . I work at nine tomorrow night . Why ? ”
36185	36205	36176	36176	He	1286	“ I need to take you shopping . You ’ll need an outfit for my mother ’s charity event . ”
36214	36239	36206	36206	I	884	“ Oh my freaking god , one inappropriate outfit and you assume I ca n’t dress myself . Seriously , I should burn it . ”
36240	36282	36283	36283	His	1286	“ That ’s not it at all . I happen to love that outfit and would be very disappointed to find you ’d burned it . I actually hope to see you wearing it again . In private , of course . ”
36304	36315	36316	36316	He	1286	“ And I ’ve adored every other outfit of yours . ”
36333	36355	36356	36356	He	1286	“ You have an excellent sense of fashion . But my mother would expect a girl I dated to be dressed … ”
36359	36366	36356	36356	He	1286	“ How should I put it ? ”
36390	36400	36401	36401	I	884	“ I get it . I need designer clothes . ”
36412	36435	36401	36401	I	884	“ I guess if you want to take me out and buy me expensive clothes , I ’m not going to argue . ”
36441	36485	36436	36436	His	1286	“ That ’s a beautiful attitude . I ’ll pick you up at two . Plan to spend the day with me . And do n’t look at me like that — there will only be sex if you want there to be . ”
36515	36537	36509	36509	I	884	“ How do you intend on this working , exactly ? Do you text me when you want a booty call ? ”
36538	36559	36560	36560	Hudson	1556	“ Sure . Or you can text me . Or we can arrange ahead of time like we did tonight . ”
36564	36573	36560	36560	Hudson	1556	“ What would you say to no condoms ? ”
36618	36650	36610	36610	I	884	“ I suppose if you ’re clean … I’m on birth control . I get the shot . My last STD test was a month ago and it came back clean . ”
36651	36666	36697	36697	his	884	“ I am clean . I ’m checked monthly . And I hate condoms . ”
36667	36673	36610	36610	I	884	“ Then no more condoms . ”
36682	36690	36697	36697	his	884	“ If I agree , I mean . ”
36691	36694	36695	36695	He	884	“ Mmhmm . ”
36735	36761	36723	36723	I	884	“ You said you expected fidelity — can I expect the same from you ? Or will you be using this loft with other women ? ”
36794	36830	36778	36778	he	884	“ I ’m not a slut , Alayna . This loft has been used for sex , yes , but I have it so I can be close to my office , not for fucking . ”
36846	36859	36831	36831	He	884	“ I will be as faithful as I expect you to be . ”
36932	36943	36926	36926	I	884	“ I ca n’t think about this anymore right now . ”
36950	36956	36957	36957	Hudson	1556	“ Why are you panicking ? ”
36999	37059	37060	37060	I	884	“ You know , it ’s all very good and fine for you to say you want a committed sexual relationship . You ’ll have no problem remaining unemotionally involved — that ’s your default . It ’s not my default . Do n’t you see what you ’re asking of me might be impossible for me to deliver ? ”
37087	37165	37077	37077	Hudson	1556	“ The more we have sex , Hudson , the more I ’m likely to latch on , and even if you were into that , you would n’t be into the level that I latch . So , trust me when I say this has bad idea written all over it . Let ’s call this a wonderful — oh , my god , such a wonderful evening — and now we need to move on . ”
37174	37182	37166	37166	His	1111	“ If that ’s what you need . ”
37183	37187	37188	37188	I	884	“ I do . ”
37197	37208	37188	37188	I	884	“ And I need a shower . Do you mind ? ”
37209	37217	37218	37218	He	1111	“ Not at all . In there . ”
37224	37232	37218	37218	He	1111	“ I ’ll bring you some towels . ”
37592	37595	37575	37575	He	1111	“ Hudson , ”
37609	37616	37617	37617	He	1111	“ Is this what you want ? ”
37627	37630	37631	37631	I	884	“ Yes ! ”
37634	37644	37631	37631	I	884	“ I mean , no . I want you . ”
37660	37674	37650	37650	he	1111	“ You ’ll have to wait . I ’m enjoying making you wait . ”
37753	37761	37739	37739	him	1111	“ I need to be washed too . ”
37868	37876	37879	37879	he	1111	“ What ’s the matter , precious ? ”
37896	37901	37902	37902	I	884	“ Um , wow , ”
37905	37912	37902	37902	I	884	“ I ’m a little intimidated . ”
37913	37927	37928	37928	His	1111	“ But it ’s already been inside you . You know it fits . ”
37933	37939	37928	37928	His	1111	“ Touch it , Alayna . ”
38217	38221	38210	38210	I	884	“ Nice wheels . ”
38239	38244	38222	38222	His	1111	“ Glad you approve . ”
38313	38319	38322	38322	I	884	“ So you drove yourself ? ”
38400	38408	38388	38388	He	1111	“ Why does my driving surprise you ? ”
38416	38425	38409	38409	I	884	“ I figured you always had a driver . ”
38446	38465	38498	38498	His	1111	“ What ’s the fun of having a cool car if you do n’t get to drive it ? ”
38466	38470	38498	38498	His	1111	“ Good point . ”
38487	38497	38476	38476	Hudson	1556	“ You look gorgeous , Alayna . As usual . ”
38529	38546	38498	38498	His	1111	“ Are you buttering me up so I ’ll let you choose what I try on ? ”
38547	38557	38498	38498	His	1111	“ I ’ll choose what you try on anyway . ”
38558	38565	38566	38566	He	1111	“ Of course , you will . ”
38627	38640	38618	38618	I	884	“ Um , Hudson , could we keep today to shopping only ? ”
38682	38689	38679	38679	he	1111	“ Whatever you want , Alayna . ”
38726	38734	38735	38735	he	1111	“ We ’re going to Mirabelle ’s , ”
38747	38753	38754	38754	Hudson	1556	“ Mirabelle , your sister ? ”
38801	38864	38794	38795	the woman	1124	“ Yes . Her friends are throwing her a baby shower today and so I ’d hoped she would n’t be at the shop . However , when she learned I was bringing my girlfriend in for a fitting , she insisted on being there to meet you . Which means we ’re officially on the job . Is that a problem ? ”
38865	38874	38875	38875	My	884	“ Um , no , of course not . ”
38925	38939	38910	38910	I	884	“ What if she asks me things ? About you ? About us ? ”
38963	38979	38980	38980	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t worry about it . I ’ll be there . Follow my lead . ”
38993	39015	38980	38980	Hudson	1556	“ Frankly , you ’re unlikely to get a chance to speak at all . Mirabelle is somewhat of a talker . ”
39016	39024	38980	38980	Hudson	1556	“ But … what do I do ? ”
39025	39031	38980	38980	Hudson	1556	“ Just be my girlfriend . ”
39032	39052	38980	38980	Hudson	1556	“ Oh my god , Hudson , you told me she was gorgeous , but I had no idea ! ”
39146	39172	39173	39173	She	1120	“ She is going to be so much fun to dress . She ’s got my favorite body type — all boobs and hips and — “
39183	39189	39176	39176	she	1120	“ Fantastic legs , Hudson ! ”
39201	39214	39196	39196	he	1130	“ Yes , I ’m well acquainted with Alayna ’s physical assets . ”
39227	39235	39221	39221	Mirabelle	1120	“ You ’re such a bad boy . ”
39250	39292	39237	39237	she	1120	“ Oh my goodness , I ’m talking about you in the third person . How could I be so rude ! I ’m so excited to finally meet you , Alayna ! Hudson has told me so much about you ! ”
39384	39396	39375	39375	I	884	“ Glad to meet you too . But call me Laynie . ”
39397	39411	39412	39412	She	1120	“ And you can call me Mira . Huds is way too proper . ”
39458	39491	39453	39454	the girl	1136	“ Okay , okay , okay , I ca n’t stay long today which I regret immensely , so let ’s get started . I already have a million ideas for you . ”
39560	39570	39571	39571	Mira	8319	“ Are we shopping only for Mom ’s event ? ”
39622	39647	39648	39648	He	1141	“ Specifically for the fashion show , but let ’s see what else we can find . Whatever Alayna loves , we ’ll buy . ”
39697	39703	39704	39704	I	884	“ Aw , thank you . ”
39718	39729	39713	39713	I	884	“ Hudson spoils me . I do n’t deserve him . ”
39744	39748	39730	39730	Hudson	1556	“ Excuse me . ”
39768	39782	39758	39758	Mira	8319	“ This and this , oh and this will be perfect on you ! ”
39792	39802	39783	39783	She	8319	“ Stacy , can you start us a room ? ”
39825	39834	39836	39836	she	8319	“ Which room do you want to use ? ”
39897	39913	39914	39914	Mira	8319	“ The big dressing room please . Laynie , this is my assistant , Stacy . ”
39924	39938	39914	39914	Mira	8319	“ Laynie is Hudson ’s girlfriend so make sure she gets VIP treatment . ”
39939	39942	39943	39943	Stacy	8674	“ Certainly , ”
39972	39983	39984	39984	I	884	“ Your assistant seems not to like me very much . ”
40019	40036	40011	40011	girlfriend	1150	“ And she seems to like Hudson an awful lot . Is there something between them ? ”
40047	40081	40037	40037	Mira	8319	“ Ignore her . Stacy ’s totally been in love with Huds for forever , even though she ’s completely not his type . Nothing to worry about . It ’s actually comical . ”
40124	40140	40141	40141	She	8319	“ Did you notice how Hudson did n’t even give her the time of day ? ”
40144	40148	40149	40149	I	884	“ I did . ”
40167	40177	40160	40160	Mira	8319	“ Hudson , what do you think about these ? ”
40196	40200	40191	40191	Hudson	1556	“ Uh huh . ”
40294	40307	40308	40308	She	8319	“ Huds , it ’s the weekend . Put your Blackberry away . ”
40315	40330	40308	40308	She	8319	“ You finally have a girlfriend . Are you trying to run her off ? ”
40340	40343	40331	40331	Hudson	1556	“ Hmm ? ”
40363	40374	40344	40344	I	884	“ Listen to your sister and stop with the working . ”
40386	40392	40375	40375	He	1152	“ Are you feeling ignored ? ”
40407	40420	40422	40422	he	1152	“ You ’re going to make me think you have another girl . ”
40475	40480	40468	40468	I	884	“ Is everything okay ? ”
40481	40486	40487	40487	He	1152	“ It ’s work . ”
40541	40556	40529	40529	His	1152	“ I ’m sorry , baby , I have to make a phone call . ”
40575	40600	40601	40601	She	8319	“ Come with me , Laynie . He can make his boring call . Let ’s go try some of these things on you . ”
40620	40631	40615	40615	Hudson	1556	“ Hold on a second , I ’ll join you . ”
40637	40652	40632	40632	Mira	8319	“ We ’ll come out and show you her outfits . Do n’t worry . ”
40653	40670	40615	40615	Hudson	1556	“ Mirabelle , I ’m not leaving Alayna alone with my over - enthusiastic little sister . ”
40719	40735	40713	40713	Mira	8319	“ You ’re not coming in the fitting room . That ’s just ... wrong . ”
40772	40779	40760	40760	I	884	“ I ’ll be fine , H. ”
40802	40811	40824	40824	I	884	“ Take care of whatever you need to . ”
40812	40815	40816	40816	he	1152	“ H ? ”
40829	40836	40824	40824	I	884	“ Go with it , baby . ”
41052	41061	41062	41062	she	8319	“ We ’ve saved the best for last , ”
41136	41148	41149	41149	she	8319	“ So Hudson told me you met at some college thingy , ”
41212	41223	41207	41207	I	884	“ Yeah , it was a graduate symposium at Stern . ”
41229	41249	41224	41224	Mira	8319	“ I have to know , was it love at first sight for you too , or just him ? ”
41262	41268	41251	41251	he	1167	“ Definitely for me too . ”
41279	41313	41269	41269	I	884	“ It ’s all so romantic . How he wanted to hire you and you already had a job , so he bought the club you work at to get closer to you . ”
41330	41336	41314	41314	I	884	“ He told you that ? ”
41349	41359	41337	41337	Mira	8319	“ Oh my god , did you not know ? ”
41360	41368	41369	41369	I	884	“ No , no , I knew . ”
41445	41466	41439	41439	I	884	“ It was crazy romantic that he bought the club . I just did n’t think he ’d tell anyone . ”
41477	41499	41500	41500	She	8319	“ It is surprising . He ’s usually so private about his emotions . You must bring out something in him . ”
41506	41528	41500	41500	She	8319	“ And this dress will totally bring something out in him or else he ’s completely blind . You look incredible ! ”
41564	41569	41570	41570	I	884	“ Do you like ? ”
41635	41646	41647	41647	Mira	8319	“ Wow , Huds is at a loss for words , ”
41658	41663	41647	41647	Mira	8319	“ Call Ripley ’s . ”
41674	41683	41684	41684	he	884	“ I ’d take you in my arms , ”
41687	41706	41684	41684	he	884	“ but I would n’t be able to look at you anymore . You ’re stunning , Alayna . ”
41707	41711	41712	41712	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
41764	41790	41791	41791	Mira	8319	“ Okay guys , I ’d tell you to get a room , but I ’m afraid you ’ll use one of the dressing rooms . ”
41805	41819	41791	41791	Mira	8319	“ I do n’t have to ask if you ’re buying this one . ”
41820	41826	41827	41827	Hudson	1556	“ We ’re taking it . ”
41911	41917	41918	41918	Mira	8319	“ I ’ll get changed . ”
41937	41966	41967	41967	She	8319	“ Aw , crap , is that really the time ? I ’m totally late ! Go on in . I ’ll send Stacy to help you undress . ”
41972	41993	41967	41967	She	8319	“ And it was so wonderful to finally meet you . I ’ll see you tomorrow at the fashion show . ”
42474	42479	42480	42480	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , watch . ”
42492	42502	42480	42480	Hudson	1556	“ See how beautiful you are when you come . ”
42636	42644	42645	42645	His	1176	“ Put your palms on the mirror . ”
42756	42761	42745	42745	he	1176	“ Fuck , Alayna ! ”
42946	42956	42938	42938	his	1176	“ This , precious . This is for real . ”
43065	43107	43152	43152	his	1176	“ My mother ’s charity fashion show starts at one tomorrow . I ’ll need to pick you up at twelve - fifteen . I ’m sorry you wo n’t get more sleep . You ’re off at three this morning ? ”
43108	43116	43152	43152	his	1176	“ Yeah . I can handle it . ”
43117	43146	43152	43152	his	1176	“ Jordan will be here to pick you up . I ’ll make sure he has all your packages and that he helps you up to your apartment . ”
43155	43165	43152	43152	his	1176	“ Unless you ’d rather I picked you up . ”
43200	43213	43193	43193	I	884	“ I ’m afraid I ’d get even less sleep that way . ”
43214	43223	43245	43245	he	1176	“ Right . Probably not a good idea . ”
43304	43311	43320	43320	I	884	“ Is everything okay with work ? ”
43336	43342	43343	43343	he	1176	“ I can handle it , ”
43459	43473	43474	43474	I	884	“ Since the ruse is on , we ’d better make it official . ”
43485	43489	43490	43490	He	1176	“ Excellent idea . ”
43537	43540	43529	43529	He	1176	“ Ready ? ”
43649	43653	43654	43654	he	1176	“ She saw , ”
43658	43661	43662	43662	I	884	“ Oh . ”
43674	43677	43678	43678	I	884	“ Good . ”
43681	43685	43686	43686	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
43692	43696	43686	43686	I	884	“ For today . ”
43730	43735	43756	43756	Liesl	166	“ Tomorrow , Alayna . ”
43775	43780	43781	43781	she	166	“ Time for details , ”
44224	44226	44220	44220	They	1216	“ together ”
44506	44510	44511	44511	he	1220	“ Stop fidgeting , ”
44514	44519	44511	44511	he	1220	“ You ’re beautiful . ”
44549	44552	44532	44532	Hudson	1556	“ Wait . ”
44559	44569	44553	44553	He	1220	“ Another request for a sex - free afternoon ? ”
44573	44583	44570	44570	I	884	“ No . I ’ve given up on that . ”
44599	44602	44603	44603	I	884	“ Anyway … ”
44614	44625	44630	44630	he	1220	“ I just wanted to say … you look hot . ”
44691	44695	44668	44668	He	1220	“ Really hot . ”
44730	44733	44734	44734	I	884	“ What ? ”
44745	44748	44749	44749	he	1220	“ Alayna , ”
44752	44784	44785	44785	He	1220	“ There ’s so many things I want to do to you right now . But we ’re on - duty , and so I ’ll have to settle for this . ”
44855	44860	44861	44861	he	1220	“ What ’s this ? ”
44875	44885	44886	44886	I	884	“ It ’s to remind me to buy coffee , ”
45038	45047	45027	45029	The elastic band	1231	“ You must really need to buy coffee . ”
45048	45057	45058	45058	My	884	“ You have n’t seen me go … . ”
45189	45212	45175	45175	We	1238	“ If you ’d like a drink , you can get something inside . My mother will be anxious to meet you . ”
45317	45322	45323	45323	I	884	“ Hudson ! Laynie ! ”
45347	45354	45355	45355	she	8319	“ Wow , you look incredible ! ”
45360	45379	45355	45355	she	8319	“ This dress looks so great paired with those shoes . And Huds matches you ! How sweet ! ”
45399	45416	45380	45380	Hudson	1556	“ You are n’t the only one in the family who has fashion sense , Mirabelle . ”
45417	45444	45453	45453	Hudson	1556	“ Of course not . Chandler ’s also very savvy . You , though , are generally too stiff to be considered anything at all creative . ”
45445	45448	45450	45450	he	1243	“ Ouch . ”
45476	45489	45490	45490	She	8319	“ Excuse me , I know this is totally rude , but … ”
45521	45527	45513	45513	He	1131	“ She knows about Alayna . ”
45535	45542	45543	45543	She	8319	“ Does she know about … ? ”
45547	45551	45552	45552	His	1131	“ She does . ”
45617	45620	45612	45612	My	884	“ What ? ”
45646	45651	45638	45638	She	8319	“ Celia ’s here . ”
45656	45668	45652	45652	Her	8319	“ I did n’t know if that would be a problem . ”
45784	45796	45775	45775	I	884	“ No , Celia ’s no problem . Right , H ? ”
45803	45808	45797	45797	He	1251	“ None at all . ”
45809	45814	45816	45817	the bitch	1252	“ Where is she ? ”
45833	45836	45837	45837	Mira	8319	“ There . ”
45872	45879	45880	45880	Mira	8319	“ You look better than her , ”
45909	45918	45919	45919	Hudson	1556	“ Mirabelle , must you be so catty ? ”
45924	45934	45919	45919	Hudson	1556	“ Anyway , Alayna looks better than most people . ”
46031	46049	46004	46004	He	1254	“ Oh , hell , no . Huds making out is not something I want to see , ”
46081	46086	46087	46088	The boy	1258	“ But , wow . ”
46099	46118	46087	46088	The boy	1258	“ Anytime you feel like moving up the social ladder , you can lay those lips on me . ”
46119	46122	46123	46123	Mira	8319	“ Chandler , ”
46126	46130	46123	46123	Mira	8319	“ Be polite . ”
46185	46193	46194	46194	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ’s nine years your senior , ”
46204	46212	46213	46213	Chandler	676	“ I ’ll be eighteen next month . ”
46286	46296	46278	46278	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , this is our brother , Chandler . ”
46312	46326	46297	46297	Hudson	1556	“ Chandler , stop undressing Alayna with your eyes . That ’s inappropriate . ”
46347	46360	46327	46327	Chandler	676	“ Because we ’re in public or because she came with you ? ”
46361	46371	46372	46372	Hudson	1556	“ Because that ’s not how you treat women . ”
46380	46395	46396	46396	He	676	“ And you ’re who ’s going to teach me how to treat women ? ”
46420	46436	46437	46437	He	1265	“ Mom sent me to summon you . She wants to meet your arm candy . ”
46478	46488	46475	46475	Hudson	1556	“ Ignore him . He ’s a horny teenager . ”
46489	46498	46499	46499	I	884	“ He takes after his horny older brother , ”
46502	46505	46506	46506	He	1265	“ Behave . ”
46559	46565	46566	46566	Chandler	676	“ This is our table , ”
46585	46591	46569	46569	He	676	“ Mom ’s over there . ”
46720	46733	46707	46707	he	884	“ You ’re going to be great . I have no doubt . ”
46930	46933	46938	46938	her	1858	“ Hudson . ”
46952	46955	46947	46947	Hudson	1556	“ Mother . ”
46963	46983	46947	46947	Hudson	1556	“ I ’d like you to meet Alayna Withers . Alayna , this is my mother , Sophia Pierce . ”
46984	46992	46993	46993	I	884	“ Glad to meet you , uh … ”
47021	47026	47016	47016	I	884	“ Glad to meet you ”
47047	47051	47040	47040	I	884	“ Mrs. Pierce . ”
47105	47111	47091	47091	she	1858	“ She ’s pretty enough . ”
47147	47155	47142	47142	she	1858	“ Where did you find her again ? ”
47191	47194	47185	47185	Mira	8319	“ Mom — ”
47226	47239	47211	47211	I	884	“ I told you . We met at a function at Stern . ”
47243	47255	47240	47240	Sophia	1858	“ What the hell were you doing at NYU ? Slumming ? ”
47275	47284	47270	47270	Hudson	1556	“ Mother , do n’t be a bitch . ”
47311	47332	47296	47296	Sophia	1858	“ Tell me , Alayna — were you first attracted to my son because of his money or his name ? ”
47368	47395	47358	47358	I	884	“ Neither . I was attracted to him because he ’s hot . Though , I stayed with him because he ’s fucking awesome in bed . ”
47455	47475	47444	47444	his	233	“ Look , Sophia Pierce . I may not have graduated from Harvard like your son and your husband — ”
47513	47545	47508	47508	I	884	“ But I ’m proud of my NYU degree . And I did n’t come here today to have my education insulted by a woman who dropped out of law school . ”
47576	47584	47569	47569	she	1858	“ Why did you come here today ? ”
47707	47752	47693	47693	I	884	“ I came here because Hudson wanted me to meet his mother . He seems to care about your opinion , for some reason . And since I care about him — a great deal , I might add — I agreed to come . ”
47785	47788	47789	47789	Mira	8319	“ Oh , ”
47810	47831	47802	47802	Sophia	1858	“ We ’re going to our Hampton house later this week . I expect you and Hudson will join us . ”
47866	47874	47860	47860	Hudson	1556	“ We can manage a long weekend . ”
47893	47911	47860	47860	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s all I can promise , Mother . Some of us work for a living . ”
47915	47934	47912	47912	She	1858	“ Fine . Now I have important people I need to speak with . Excuse me , please . ”
47942	47947	47935	47935	She	1858	“ Richard ! Annette ! ”
47993	47996	47986	47986	they	1295	“ What ? ”
48031	48038	48017	48017	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna . You ’re amazing . ”
48069	48076	48061	48061	I	884	“ I ’m working this weekend . ”
48077	48083	48048	48048	he	676	“ Get out of it . ”
48101	48106	48114	48114	he	676	“ getting out of work ”
48207	48239	48199	48199	I	884	“ H , I ’m sorry to say this since she ’s your mother and all , but I ca n’t handle spending time with her . She ’s not nice . ”
48263	48285	48244	48244	he	676	“ We wo n’t spend every minute with her . And , anyway , you seemed to handle her just fine . ”
48346	48365	48342	48342	I	884	“ Okay , but I ca n’t be responsible for my actions if she ’s like that again . ”
48378	48387	48366	48366	He	676	“ That ’s what I ’m counting on . ”
48798	48813	48783	48783	He	700	“ Oh , you do n’t need to be all PDA on my account , ”
48821	48827	48783	48783	He	700	“ Remember , I know . ”
48891	48896	48897	48897	She	1556	“ I ’m Celia . ”
48905	48927	48897	48897	She	1556	“ I thought we should probably meet . Though , it does n’t look like Hudson ’s too keen on it . ”
48937	48948	48949	48949	he	700	“ No , you ’re right . You should meet , ”
48985	48991	49007	49007	She	1317	“ Now you ’ve met . ”
48992	49006	49007	49007	She	1317	“ You are n’t getting rid of me that easily , you oaf . ”
49018	49029	49007	49007	She	1317	“ Believe it or not , we ’re actually friends . ”
49117	49125	49114	49114	Hudson	1556	“ What do you want , Ceeley ? ”
49138	49150	49114	49114	Hudson	1556	“ I wanted to personally thank Alayna for this whole charade . ”
49193	49212	49173	49173	Celia	9246	“ You ca n’t know how dreadful the idea of marrying that pain in the ass has been . ”
49221	49228	49173	49173	Celia	9246	“ Um , I can imagine . ”
49244	49253	49173	49173	Celia	9246	“ He ’s not the settling down type . ”
49284	49294	49295	49295	She	9246	“ Wow . You already know him so well . ”
49324	49336	49301	49301	she	9246	“ It ’s nice to talk to someone else who knows . ”
49337	49347	49348	49348	She	9246	“ But is n’t Hudson amazingly good at pretending ? ”
49366	49370	49371	49371	I	884	“ He is . ”
49421	49425	49417	49417	my	884	“ Quite good . ”
49426	49449	49450	49450	Hudson	1556	“ I ’d love to continue this wonderfully entertaining conversation , but I see someone I need to talk some business with . ”
49460	49463	49450	49450	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ? ”
49511	49522	49498	49498	I	884	“ Go ahead , H. I ’ll hang with Celia . ”
49523	49529	49530	49530	Celia	9246	“ We ’ll be fine , ”
49534	49553	49530	49530	Celia	9246	“ And we ’ll end our conversation with a pretend catfight if you want to up the charade . ”
49559	49574	49554	49554	Hudson	1556	“ No catfight . In my script , you ’re friendly toward each other . ”
49575	49593	49594	49594	Celia	9246	“ Then she and I should sit and chat , since we ’re supposed to be friends . ”
49599	49604	49594	49594	Celia	9246	“ Right , Alayna ? ”
49605	49608	49609	49609	I	884	“ Right . ”
49625	49638	49619	49619	She	9246	“ And since we ’re friends , you should call me Laynie . ”
49639	49645	49646	49646	He	884	“ Friendly , not friends . ”
49663	49672	49646	49646	He	884	“ Fine . I ’ll be back shortly . ”
49745	49750	49751	49751	I	884	“ You like him , ”
49775	49803	49768	49768	She	9246	“ Seriously ? I ’m probably your one opportunity to get any real information about Hudson and his life and that ’s what you want to know ? ”
49807	49818	49804	49804	I	884	“ You ’re right , I ’d like some info . ”
49857	49885	49850	49850	I	884	“ Okay , Mira seemed to think I should be jealous of you . Should I be ? I mean , should I be pretending I am ? ”
49893	49979	49886	49886	Celia	9246	“ Well , is n’t that a clever way to ask the same question ? No . Hudson and I have never been anything but friends . If he were a boyfriend who spilled his guts to his girlfriend , he ’d tell you that I liked him , but that he ’s never felt anything for me but friendship . So unless you ’re the shallow type who ’s jealous of all girls her guy ’s friends with , then do n’t play jealous . ”
50019	50051	50011	50011	my	884	“ No jealousy then . What about his family ? Is he close to them or is he as withdrawn with them as with everyone ? I ca n’t quite tell . ”
50052	50083	50084	50084	She	1325	“ He loves them all , deeply . As deeply as Hudson can love anyone , I mean . But it takes quite a lot of perception to get that . ”
50094	50107	50084	50084	She	1325	“ I think someone he was in love with would know that . ”
50134	50161	50116	50116	I	884	“ Why does n’t Hudson ’s mother believe that he ’d be in love ? Other than that she ’s a cold - hearted bitch herself . ”
50169	50177	50116	50116	I	884	“ Has he never dated anyone before ? ”
50178	50206	50116	50116	I	884	“ Sort of . I mean , he ’s dated women . Not women he ever brought to meet his mother , but , yeah he dated . ”
50261	50299	50348	50348	My	884	“ You know , date is not the right word . He ’d sleep with them . And then he ’d mess with them . It got him in all sorts of trouble . More than once . ”
50303	50312	50300	50300	I	884	“ What do you mean messed with them ? ”
50313	50347	50413	50413	Boy	192	“ I should n’t tell you . He does n’t want you to know . But I really think you should . Otherwise you might be caught off guard if Sophia says something . ”
50354	50362	50348	50348	My	884	“ How did he mess with them ? ”
50366	50412	50363	50363	She	1328	“ It ’s hard to explain . Like , he ’d say he only wanted to be friends or friends with benefits , but then he ’d manipulate them in that way of his , you know , how he always gets what he wants ? ”
50424	50490	50491	50491	She	1329	“ He ’d manipulate these women into falling in love with him . Which is n’t really hard , I mean , he is Hudson . But he ’d really play them . Lead them on , get them really hooked on him . It was like a game for him — one of the crappy things spoiled rich kids do just because they can . ”
50494	50516	50491	50491	She	1329	“ I can say that because I love Hudson dearly . Also , I ’m a spoiled rich kid , too . ”
50543	50553	50532	50532	Hudson	1556	“ Does he , um , still do that ? ”
50554	50674	50675	50675	She	1331	“ I honestly do n’t know . He ’s had a ton of therapy so I ’d like to say he ’s ‘ better ’ now , but who knows ? Of course , because of it , his mother got the idea that if he married someone like me , I could keep him in line . And my parents want me married to the Pierce name and bank account — they’re disgustingly greedy . But I could never deal with those head trips — even though I am very fond of him . And I ’d love to get in that beautiful man ’s pants . Can you imagine how gorgeous our children would be ? Sigh . ”
50755	50758	50742	50742	Hudson	1556	“ better . ”
50772	50774	50770	50770	I	884	“ better ”
50822	50887	50814	50814	Celia	9246	“ But this plan of Hudson ’s is brilliant . As soon as Sophia relaxes enough to believe he ’s fallen for you , she ’s going to be ecstatic . She wants him to be normal . She wants him to be happy and in love . I want him to be happy and in love . Too bad it ’s not real . ”
50902	50912	50893	50893	She	9246	“ Are you okay ? You seem really pale . ”
50953	50964	50950	50950	my	884	“ I ’m not feeling well all of a sudden . ”
50977	50985	50969	50969	I	884	“ Excuse me , I have to … ”
51003	51005	50999	50999	I	884	“Go . ”
51101	51107	51108	51108	He	884	“ Where are you going ? ”
51144	51150	51137	51137	I	884	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
51158	51161	51151	51151	Hudson	1556	“ Whoa . ”
51185	51192	51151	51151	Hudson	1556	“ What ’s wrong with you ? ”
51204	51217	51193	51193	I	884	“ What ’s wrong with you would be the more appropriate question . ”
51218	51221	51222	51222	He	884	“ Alayna . ”
51233	51264	51222	51222	He	884	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , but you ’re making a scene . You need to calm down and save whatever this is for later . ”
51280	51293	51265	51265	He	884	“ There is n’t going to be a later — I quit . ”
51307	51310	51311	51311	He	884	“ Alayna ! ”
51348	51381	51337	51337	I	884	“ Tell me , Hudson , did you pick me because you thought my obsession issues would make your game more fun ? Because really , where ’s the challenge in that ? ”
51391	51399	51382	51382	Hudson	1556	“ Fuck Celia and her big mouth . ”
51426	51436	51417	51417	He	884	“ Let ’s talk about this in the limo . ”
51437	51443	51444	51444	He	884	“ I do n’t want — “
51449	51475	51444	51444	He	884	“ Alayna . It ’s not fair of you to listen to a stranger tell her story and not give me a chance to explain . ”
51493	51559	51444	51444	He	884	“ I ’m telling you we will talk about this in the limo which is parked in the lot next door . First , because my mother is watching , I ’m going to bend down and kiss your forehead . Then I ’m going to walk over and tell her that you are n’t feeling well . I will meet you in the car . ”
51689	51701	51673	51673	I	884	“ The limo , Alayna . I ’ll meet you there . ”
51770	51779	51780	51780	I	884	“ Take me home , please , Jordan , ”
51945	51964	51938	51938	Hudson	1556	“ Jordan , drive around until I say otherwise . Or find someplace to park for a while . ”
52113	52121	52108	52108	he	655	“ What exactly did Celia tell you ? ”
52128	52145	52122	52122	I	884	“ Oh , just how you fuck with vulnerable women ’s emotions . Is it true ? ”
52146	52149	52150	52150	He	655	“ Alayna — “
52163	52169	52170	52170	He	655	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
52175	52186	52170	52170	He	655	“ And stop saying my name . Is it true ? ”
52187	52197	52198	52198	His	655	“ Will you calm down so I can explain ? ”
52223	52230	52215	52215	I	884	“ Is . It . True ? ”
52238	52245	52246	52246	He	655	“ Yes , it ’s true ! ”
52256	52265	52246	52246	He	655	“ In the past , it was true . ”
52326	52352	52353	52353	He	655	“ I did ... things ... that I ’m not proud of . I manipulated people . I hurt them and often it was deliberate . ”
52372	52388	52353	52353	He	655	“ But not now . I do n’t do that now . Not with you . ”
52410	52454	52395	52395	I	884	“ Really ? Because it seems completely obvious that you did exactly that with me . The way you picked me out at the symposium and you tracked me down and gave me a spa vacation and Jesus , you bought the club ! ”
52460	52497	52455	52455	He	655	“ It ’s not like that . I explained the gift and I was looking at the club anyway . When I found out you worked there , yes , it helped me make my decision — ”
52503	52548	52498	52498	I	884	“ And you ‘ hired ’ me and seduced me . And when I told you I needed to not have sex with you , you somehow got me to do exactly that . You are manipulative . You ’re a bully , Hudson . ”
52567	52580	52584	52584	his	655	“ No , Alayna . I did n’t want that with you . ”
52629	52641	52606	52606	he	655	“ I do n’t want to be like that with you . ”
52656	52669	52642	52642	I	884	“ Then what do you want to be with me , Hudson ? ”
52670	52678	52679	52679	He	655	“ Honestly ? I ’m not sure . ”
52760	52818	52819	52819	I	884	“ I ’m drawn to you , Alayna . Not because I want to hurt you or make you feel a certain way , but because you ’re beautiful and sexy and smart and , yes , a little crazy , maybe , but you ’re not broken . And that makes me hopeful . For me . ”
52887	52923	52924	52924	His	655	“ And maybe I ’ve been a bully . But I ’m a dominant person . I can try to change things about me , but the fundamentals of my personality are never going away . ”
52929	52941	52924	52924	His	655	“ You of all people should be able to understand that . ”
53078	53083	53075	53076	that person	1358	“ I ’m sorry . ”
53096	53111	53075	53076	that person	1358	“ I ’m sorry . You did n’t judge me and I judged you . ”
53127	53161	53075	53076	that person	1358	“ And I exaggerated when I called you a bully . I have n’t done anything I did n’t want to . And your whole confident , domineering thing is actually kinda hot . ”
53190	53202	53186	53186	they	1359	“ Alayna , do n’t quit . Do n’t quit me . ”
53225	53266	53203	53203	I	884	“ Hudson , I have to . Not because of this , well , not only because of this , but because of my past . I ’m not well enough to be with someone who has his own issues . ”
53283	53300	53203	53203	I	884	“ You are , Alayna . You only tell that to yourself because you ’re scared . ”
53308	53331	53303	53303	me	884	“ I should be scared . It ’s not safe . For either of us . You should be scared , too . ”
53366	53391	53361	53361	he	8269	“ I do n’t believe that . I think spending time with another person who has similar compulsive tendencies can provide insight and healing . ”
53543	53549	53550	53550	I	884	“ I wo n’t quit . ”
53556	53569	53550	53550	I	884	“ But I ca n’t have a relationship with you , Hudson . ”
53580	53597	53576	53576	I	884	“ All I can give you is the fake . I have to protect myself here . ”
53627	53631	53632	53632	He	8269	“ I understand . ”
53659	53663	53664	53664	He	8269	“ Thank you . ”
53707	53715	53694	53694	I	884	“ Hudson , you ’re not broken . ”
53742	53752	53738	53738	His	8269	“ What are you ... ? Is that ... ? ”
53792	53802	53803	53803	He	8269	“ Yes . I ’d worn it for you . ”
53806	53819	53803	53803	He	8269	“ Wow . That was … that was very thoughtful of you . ”
53853	53858	53846	53846	I	884	“ I ’m sorry . ”
53859	53868	53869	53869	His	8269	“ I know . I am , too . ”
53884	53903	53869	53869	His	8269	“ This may be poor timing , but I need to get back to my mother ’s show . ”
53904	53907	53869	53869	His	8269	“ Sure . ”
53908	53925	53869	53869	His	8269	“ And since you ’re supposed to be sick , you will need to go home . ”
53938	53947	53948	53948	I	884	“ When is our next show , boss ? ”
53972	53986	53987	53987	He	8269	“ I ’m not sure . I have to fly to Cincinnati tonight . ”
53992	54000	53987	53987	He	8269	“ And I am not your boss . ”
54001	54006	53987	53987	He	8269	“ Cincinnati ? Tonight ? ”
54007	54029	53987	53987	He	8269	“ Yes , tonight . I have a meeting first thing in the morning . My jet ’s leaving early evening . ”
54037	54054	53987	53987	He	8269	“ I ’ll text you later to arrange the Hamptons . We ’ll leave Friday afternoon . ”
54055	54064	54065	54065	I	884	“ So you ’ll be gone all week ? ”
54079	54086	53987	53987	He	8269	“ I ’m not sure yet . ”
54087	54090	54091	54091	He	8269	“ Oh . ”
54212	54215	54216	54216	He	8269	“ Alayna . ”
54238	54259	54225	54225	I	884	“ Thank you for today . I think you ’ve truly made an impression on my mother . Good work . ”
54426	54437	54413	54413	I	884	“ Thanks for the coffee . And for everything else . ”
55089	55095	55087	55087	David	180	“ Something ’s come up , ”
55099	55106	55087	55087	David	180	“ Reschedule for Wednesday at 7 . ”
55871	55874	55875	55875	His	1407	“ Alayna . ”
55980	55997	55972	55972	He	1407	“ Gentlemen , my girlfriend has decided to surprise me with a visit to my office . ”
56012	56019	56020	56024	one of the other men	1410	“ That can never be good , ”
56031	56050	56027	56027	they	1409	“ Well , we ’ll leave you to her then . Thank you again for meeting with us . ”
56139	56148	56130	56130	he	1410	“ What are you doing here , Alayna ? ”
56380	56394	56368	56368	I	884	“ I , uh , I wanted to see if you were back . ”
56416	56432	56410	56410	he	209	“ I got back late last night . You could have called . Or texted . ”
56472	56480	56469	56469	I	884	“ You do n’t answer my texts . ”
56481	56489	56469	56469	I	884	“ I did n’t answer one text . ”
56525	56532	56508	56508	I	884	“ It was my only text . ”
56605	56628	56602	56602	he	209	“ I did n’t realize it was important to you . I ’ll make a better effort to respond in the future . ”
56641	56678	56634	56634	He	209	“ But you ca n’t just come here like this . How do you think it looks to have my girlfriend wandering around the lobby , riding the elevators when I ’m not even in town ? ”
56679	56685	56634	56634	He	209	“ How did you … ? ”
56686	56696	56634	56634	He	209	“ I pay people to know things , Alayna . ”
56752	56764	56744	56744	I	884	“ I … I’m sorry . I could n’t help myself . ”
56765	56774	56775	56775	He	209	“ Please , do n’t do it again . ”
56805	56813	56794	56794	He	209	“ Why are you being like this ? ”
56818	56822	56814	56814	His	209	“ Like what ? ”
56823	56856	56814	56814	His	209	“ I ’ve fucked things up , Hudson ! You should be calling your security to escort me out . I ’m a mess and you ’re taking it all in stride . ”
56878	56881	56882	56882	he	209	“ No , ”
56897	56928	56882	56882	he	209	“ That ’s what I meant about being around someone who understood . I know about compulsion . I know about having to do things you know you should n’t . ”
56948	56963	56929	56929	He	209	“ When you feel you ca n’t help yourself , talk to me first . ”
57037	57048	57028	57029	his secretary	1426	“ Mr. Pierce , your one - thirty is here . ”
57059	57084	57049	57049	Hudson	1556	“ I apologize for cutting this short , Alayna , but I have another meeting now . And I ’m leaving again this evening . ”
57131	57147	57123	57123	he	1426	“ I hate that you ’re leaving . It makes me feel a little distraught . ”
57159	57166	57167	57167	He	1426	“ I ’ll be back tomorrow . ”
57174	57183	57167	57167	He	1426	“ Join me tomorrow night for the symphony . ”
57190	57193	57184	57184	My	884	“ Yes . ”
57194	57207	57167	57167	He	1426	“ I ’ll pick you up at six . Wear the dress . ”
57298	57306	57289	57289	I	884	“ I’m … I’ve slipped a bit . ”
57377	57436	57373	57373	Lauren	166	“ When you get home , I ’d like you to write out a list of your recent negative behaviors , including behaviors you only thought about engaging in . Then come up with a list of healthy behaviors you can substitute whenever you feel compelled to engage in an unhealthy one . Do you need any help ? ”
57437	57440	57441	57441	I	884	“ No . ”
57495	57508	57533	57533	She	166	“ Good . You know your patterns . Are you still journaling ? ”
57509	57517	57533	57533	She	166	“ I have n’t in a while . ”
57525	57532	57533	57533	She	166	“ I recommend you start again . ”
57545	57548	57550	57550	I	884	“ Okay . ”
57720	57730	57710	57710	I	884	“ Do you really have to leave town again ? ”
57739	57745	57733	57733	I	884	“ I ’m afraid so . ”
57777	57790	57773	57773	he	180	“ But I ’m glad to know you ’re thinking of me . ”
57798	57801	57804	57804	him	180	“ Always , ”
57867	57874	57856	57856	I	884	“ Are you thinking of me ? ”
57895	57901	57902	57902	David	180	“ Laynie , come in . ”
57922	57927	57910	57910	His	180	“ Is everything okay ? ”
57937	57945	57946	57946	I	884	“ What came up the other day ? ”
57959	57962	57963	57963	David	180	“ This . ”
58027	58032	58033	58033	David	180	“ Oh . That . ”
58062	58071	58072	58072	He	180	“ You want to explain this , Laynie ? ”
58087	58138	58072	58072	He	180	“ ’Cause I ’ll tell you what it looks like . It looks like you were so eager to get your precious promotion that , when you could n’t get it by playing me , you chose to go after the next guy who could get you what you wanted . ”
58160	58175	58139	58139	I	884	“ It ’s not like that , David . It was never like that . ”
58201	58206	58207	58207	He	180	“ It was n’t ? ”
58221	58232	58207	58207	He	180	“ Then tell me what it was like , Laynie . ”
58233	58240	58241	58241	My	884	“ It’s … I ca n’t … ”
58290	58299	58300	58300	He	180	“ Yeah , that ’s what I thought . ”
58315	58345	58346	58346	He	180	“ Now I ’m forced to move you up , implement your ideas , never mind that I was going to anyway , or fear for my own job . ”
58350	58361	58346	58346	He	180	“ I ’m probably grooming you to take my place . ”
58362	58367	58372	58372	I	884	“ David , no . ”
58426	58435	58408	58409	that duo	1440	“ Does Pierce have any idea about me ? ”
58436	58442	58408	58409	that duo	1440	“ David , do n’t . ”
58447	58459	58443	58443	His	180	“ Does he know that you ’re The Sky Launch slut ? ”
58490	58525	58481	58481	I	884	“ If you really believe what you ’re saying , David , that I have some power over Hudson , then maybe you should be a little more careful how you talk to me . ”
58539	58545	58546	58546	I	884	“ Now , sit down , ”
58549	58561	58546	58546	I	884	“ and we can talk about this in a civilized manner . ”
58572	58632	58546	58546	I	884	“ Good . Let me see if I have this right — you think I ’m dating Hudson so that I could get a promotion at the club . A promotion that you ’ve basically promised me because of my hard work here over the past few years . A promotion I earned before you and I even kissed . ”
58633	58642	58643	58643	His	180	“ Why else would you be dating him ? ”
58654	58671	58672	58672	I	884	“ Not that it ’s any of your business , but I ’m dating Hudson because … ”
58687	58757	58672	58672	I	884	“ Because I like him . And he likes me . We connect . And , even before our first date , he spelled out to me that he would have nothing to do with helping me move up here . And I accepted it because I knew I could get the manager title on my merit alone . Tell me , did Hudson instruct you to promote me ? ”
58762	58765	58758	58758	His	884	“ No . ”
58766	58785	58758	58758	His	884	“ And were you going to offer me the position before you saw our picture in the paper ? ”
58786	58789	58758	58758	His	884	“ Yes . ”
58790	58799	58758	58758	His	884	“ Then what are we even talking about ? ”
58807	58835	58800	58800	He	884	“ Laynie … I … I do n’t know what to say . I guess I jumped to conclusions . I said things that were uncalled for . ”
58836	58849	58850	58850	I	884	“ I get it . I knew it would look that way . ”
58865	58874	58850	58850	I	884	“ Maybe I should have said something earlier . ”
58887	58912	58881	58881	he	180	“ No , I was acting jealous . And I did n’t have any right to . I ’m the one who ended things . ”
58913	58918	58919	58919	I	884	“ It ’s okay . ”
58964	58981	58959	58959	I	884	“ Um , about the promotion … did you say you were giving it to me ? ”
58985	58999	58982	58982	He	180	“ Yes . Of course I am . Pierce did n’t tell you ? ”
59025	59031	59017	59017	I	884	“ He really did n’t . ”
59032	59048	59049	59049	He	180	“ Good . I ’m glad to be the first to tell you . Congratulations . ”
59061	59070	59049	59049	He	180	“ What am I doing ? Come here . ”
59101	59144	59091	59091	He	180	“ And we ’re taking your suggestions . We ’ll extend the club hours starting in August . Which means you have a lot of work to do to get the place ready . Plan on lots of marketing and promotional meetings . ”
59153	59159	59145	59145	I	884	“ Thank you , David . ”
59160	59165	59091	59091	He	180	“ You deserve it . ”
59292	59295	59283	59283	I	884	“ Always , ”
59373	59383	59384	59384	Jordan	655	“ Mr. Pierce is late getting back in town , ”
59387	59401	59384	59384	Jordan	655	“ He ’ll meet you at Lincoln Center . I have your ticket . ”
59430	59442	59443	59443	I	884	“ Do you mind if I ride up front with you ? ”
59446	59460	59443	59443	I	884	“ I ’m sure Mr. Pierce would rather you sat in the back . ”
59477	59488	59461	59461	I	884	“ Then we wo n’t tell him , will we ? ”
59688	59699	59700	59700	Jordan	655	“ Jordan ? What has Hudson told you about me ? ”
59728	59741	59742	59742	His	655	“ You ’re not supposed to chat with me , are you ? ”
59749	59776	59742	59742	His	655	“ Oh , come on . He probably also said to keep me happy . And right now some validation is what would make me happy . ”
59790	59801	59777	59777	He	655	“ He said you ’re the lady in his life . ”
59802	59806	59810	59810	he	655	“ He did ? ”
59836	59847	59834	59834	others	889	“ How many ladies has he had in his life ? ”
59848	59881	59834	59834	others	889	“ I have n’t been hired to drive any others , Ms. Withers . I ’ve only always driven him . Occasionally he might have a date , but not very often . ”
59894	59906	59834	59834	others	889	“ Certainly none of them held his interest like you do . ”
59918	59927	59907	59907	I	884	“ You do n’t have to say that . ”
59928	59938	59834	59834	others	889	“ I do n’t . But it ’s true . ”
59981	59989	59978	59978	I	884	“ What do you think about Hudson ? ”
59990	59993	59994	59994	Jordan	655	“ Me ? ”
60001	60026	59994	59994	Jordan	655	“ Well , he ’s a good boss . Very clear with his expectations . He demands a lot but the benefits are proportional . ”
60050	60057	60045	60045	I	884	“ I mean as a person . ”
60061	60074	60075	60075	He	655	“ I do n’t know him as anything but a business man . ”
60080	60101	60075	60075	He	655	“ You may be one of the only people I ’ve ever met who knows him as just a man . ”
60102	60107	60075	60075	He	655	“ I doubt that . ”
60128	60136	60075	60075	He	655	“ I would n’t be so sure . ”
60177	60202	60161	60161	Jordan	655	“ Tonight is a donor ’s event . So there ’s a light buffet in the lobby . Mr. Pierce insisted you enjoy yourself . ”
60241	60251	60227	60227	I	884	“ Do you know when he ’ll be here ? ”
60257	60282	60283	60283	He	655	“ A late meeting of the day delayed his take - off . But he assures he ’ll arrive as soon as he can . ”
60293	60307	60283	60283	He	655	“ Ms. Withers ? If I may say , you look quite lovely . ”
60594	60597	60598	60598	Celia	9246	“ Laynie ! ”
60605	60621	60598	60598	Celia	9246	“ I ’m so glad you came . Where ’s that handsome man of yours ? ”
60650	60668	60669	60669	I	884	“ I would n’t have missed tonight . I ’ve been looking forward to seeing you again . ”
60694	60714	60683	60683	she	9246	“ Hudson ’s late flying in . He ’s been out - of - town most of this week . ”
60761	60780	60811	60811	Mr.	1477	“ Oh , yes . He told me he was leaving again when I talked to him yesterday . ”
60787	60810	60811	60811	Mr.	1477	“ Let me introduce you to my parents , Warren and Madge Werner . This is Alayna Withers , Hudson ’s girlfriend . ”
60828	60837	60838	60838	Madge	246	“ It ’s nice to finally meet you , ”
60841	60851	60838	60838	Madge	246	“ Sophia has told me so much about you . ”
60901	60907	60908	60908	I	884	“ Sophia ’s a delight , ”
60947	60952	60953	60953	Celia	9246	“ Is n’t she ? ”
60976	60984	60970	60970	Madge	246	“ Where did you meet Hudson again ? ”
61017	61020	61021	61021	Warren	245	“ Withers , ”
61029	61037	61021	61021	Warren	245	“ Any relation to Joel and Patty ? ”
61038	61043	61045	61045	he	1483	“ No , sorry . ”
61104	61109	61096	61096	I	884	“ Where are you ? ”
61134	61139	61129	61130	the audience	1486	“ Right beside you . ”
61271	61277	61266	61266	he	1483	“ What did you think ? ”
61278	61283	61284	61284	I	884	“ I loved it . ”
61329	61335	61342	61342	he	1483	“ I knew you would . ”
61365	61368	61342	61342	he	1483	“ Showtime . ”
61387	61411	61369	61369	He	1483	“ Madge , Warren . I wish I ’d been here to make introductions . I take it you ’ve all met now . ”
61412	61416	61417	61417	Madge	246	“ We have , ”
61420	61425	61417	61417	Madge	246	“ Celia introduced us . ”
61426	61443	61452	61452	he	1483	“ Good . I wanted the most important people in my life to know each other . ”
61465	61486	61452	61452	he	1483	“ I ’m sorry I was late , darling . You look stunning . The most beautiful woman here tonight . ”
61530	61532	61525	61525	He	1483	“ darling ”
61549	61564	61535	61535	I	884	“ You do n’t know that . You ’ve barely looked at anyone else . ”
61572	61584	61565	61565	He	1483	“ Because I ca n’t take my eyes off of you . ”
61604	61613	61614	61614	Warren	245	“ You were out of town this week ? ”
61631	61640	61627	61627	Hudson	1556	“ Celia said you were away on business . ”
61673	61681	61657	61657	Hudson	1556	“ Yes . A development with Plexis . ”
61687	61700	61682	61682	Warren	245	“ That ’s been a thorn in your side for some time . ”
61701	61705	61706	61706	Madge	246	“ Excuse us , ”
61709	61726	61706	61706	Madge	246	“ While you men talk about all your boring business , us girls will freshen up . ”
61740	61744	61732	61732	Madge	246	“ us girls , ”
61942	61947	61948	61948	Madge	246	“ She ’s pretty , ”
61951	61960	61948	61948	Madge	246	“ I ’m sorry she ’s so pretty . ”
61961	61964	61965	61965	Celia	9246	“ Mom , ”
61968	61971	61965	61965	Celia	9246	“ Stop . ”
61972	62000	61948	61948	Madge	246	“ I ’m sure it ’s only a fling , honey . This is Hudson ’s first real girlfriend . You never settle down with your first . ”
62012	62047	61965	61965	Celia	9246	“ Mother , I do n’t feel that way about him anymore . I ’ve told you . He ’s psycho , anyway . You would n’t want our kids to have those genes . ”
62048	62092	62132	62140	the woman who was probably Hudson ’s closest friend	9246	“ He ’s got better genes than most . And I know you say you ’re over him , Ceeley , but you do n’t have to pretend with me . Just make sure he gets thoroughly tested when you get him back . ”
62093	62096	61965	61965	Celia	9246	“ Mom ! ”
62528	62532	62533	62533	Hudson	1556	“ I drove , ”
62932	62942	62918	62918	I	884	“ So you knew Celia would be there tonight . ”
62975	62988	62989	62989	He	245	“ I knew Celia would be there with her parents , yes . ”
62995	63008	62989	62989	He	245	“ Her parents , whom are friends with my parents , remember . ”
63164	63169	63170	63170	Hudson	1556	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
63237	63242	63243	63243	I	884	“ I want you , ”
63260	63263	63266	63266	his	1517	“ Alayna ? ”
63271	63278	63279	63279	I	884	“ I know what I said . ”
63296	63340	63279	63279	I	884	“ But maybe I was wrong . I mean , I do n’t know if you ’re right — if spending time with you can make me better . But I know that since we ’ve been apart , I ’ve been worse . ”
63353	63358	63346	63346	I	884	“ I miss you . ”
63367	63374	63346	63346	I	884	“ Told you I get attached . ”
63384	63394	63381	63381	his	1517	“ Where do you think I ’m taking you ? ”
63436	63439	63440	63440	I	884	“ Oh , ”
63460	63479	63440	63440	I	884	“ I told you no more sex , and you were taking me to the loft without asking ? ”
63480	63483	63484	63484	he	1517	“ Alayna , ”
63489	63506	63484	63484	he	1517	“ You are a bundle of mixed signals . At the symphony you seemed to indicate — “
63507	63515	63516	63516	I	884	“ And you totally blew me off , ”
63519	63529	63516	63516	I	884	“ Do n’t talk to me about mixed signals ! ”
63538	63557	63530	63530	He	1517	“ I was trying to avoid mixing business with pleasure . A difficult task with you , precious . ”
63563	63578	63530	63530	He	1517	“ Especially with your wandering hands and how hot you look in that dress . ”
63582	63585	63586	63586	I	884	“ Oh , ”
63621	63641	63642	63642	He	1517	“ If you want me to ask , I will , though you know it ’s not my style . ”
63649	63651	63642	63642	He	1517	“ yes ”
63660	63671	63642	63642	He	1517	“ May I take you to my bed , Alayna ? ”
63689	63692	63693	63693	I	884	“ Yes , ”
63802	63812	63798	63798	Hudson	1556	“ Those hungry eyes are not helping the situation . ”
63911	63919	63905	63905	his	1523	“ You ’re so beautiful , Alayna . ”
63920	63925	63905	63905	his	1523	“ Then kiss me . ”
63935	63944	63947	63947	he	1523	“ I think I ’ll take my time . ”
64008	64019	64001	64001	His	1523	“ I think I ’ll urge you to move faster . ”
64033	64039	64040	64040	he	1523	“ Fuck me , Alayna ! ”
64053	64062	64063	64063	I	884	“ You ’ll get no protest from me . ”
64072	64085	64063	64063	I	884	“ Actually , I ’d like to fuck you with my mouth . ”
64141	64145	64146	64146	he	1523	“ Get in , ”
64362	64369	64347	64347	I	884	“ There ’s the big boy , ”
64462	64476	64441	64441	He	1523	“ God , Alayna . That ’s so … ah … so good . ”
64589	64594	64600	64600	his	1523	“ Alayna , stop . ”
64628	64635	64621	64621	I	884	“ Did I do something wrong ? ”
64636	64646	64647	64647	He	1523	“ No , precious . Your mouth is amazing . ”
64656	64675	64647	64647	He	1523	“ But I need to come inside your cunt . I ’ve been thinking about it for days . ”
64693	64701	64676	64676	He	1523	“ And you need to be naked . ”
64718	64725	64726	64726	I	884	“ That will take too long , ”
64732	64738	64739	64739	He	1523	“ It has to be . ”
64755	64770	64744	64744	he	1523	“ I have to have access to your breasts . I love your breasts . ”
64782	64792	64771	64771	I	884	“ Then you have to be naked , too . ”
64800	64806	64793	64793	He	1523	“ That will take longer . ”
64807	64821	64822	64822	His	1523	“ But I love the feel of my breasts against your bare chest . ”
64831	64849	64822	64822	His	1523	“ I do n’t even want to know how you got into this dress . Turn around . ”
65138	65146	65132	65132	He	1523	“ I have n’t gotten you ready . ”
65147	65159	65132	65132	He	1523	“ I ’m close enough . Come on in , Hudson . ”
65293	65302	65269	65269	My	884	“ Hudson , yes . God , yes . ”
65329	65336	65337	65337	he	1523	“ So … damn … good , ”
65340	65350	65337	65337	he	1523	“ You feel … so … damn … good . ”
65426	65433	65434	65434	he	1523	“ Come with me , Alayna , ”
65437	65440	65434	65434	he	1523	“ Come . ”
65537	65544	65545	65545	I	884	“ Can we do that again ? ”
65571	65592	65559	65559	he	1523	“ You have to be to work at one ? I think we can manage to do that again twice . ”
65595	65609	65610	65610	We	1533	“ Okay , H , we need to have a heart to heart . ”
65674	65678	65658	65658	He	1523	“ Sounds intriguing . ”
65685	65694	65679	65679	I	884	“ I have some grievances about last night . ”
65712	65720	65721	65721	I	884	“ Not that part of last night . ”
65727	65741	65721	65721	I	884	“ The earlier part of the night . The later part was fine . ”
65745	65749	65742	65742	He	1523	“ Only fine ? ”
65750	65755	65756	65756	I	884	“ More than fine , ”
65759	65767	65756	65756	I	884	“ It was spectacular . Incredibly spectacular . ”
65813	65821	65810	65810	I	884	“ How did you think it was ? ”
65822	65825	65826	65826	His	1523	“ Fine . ”
65866	65873	65874	65874	He	1523	“ Careful ! I ’m driving . ”
65891	65897	65874	65874	He	1523	“ But you have grievances ? ”
65911	65962	65898	65898	I	884	“ Yes . I do . I was not prepared for the situation you put me in . I need to know more going forward . I knew nothing about the Werners being at the symphony last night . Could n’t you have at least given me a heads up ? ”
66034	66047	66010	66010	He	1523	“ Except for your predilection for putting your hands all over me — “
66048	66055	66096	66096	I	884	“ Oh , do n’t exaggerate . ”
66056	66062	66063	66063	He	1523	“ — you were magnificent . ”
66079	66095	66073	66073	I	884	“ How would any information I could have given you have changed how you performed ? ”
66110	66123	66096	66096	I	884	“ I would have been more at ease because I was prepared . ”
66134	66155	66096	66096	I	884	“ The same goes for the day at the fashion show . I could have handled your mother , Celia — ”
66175	66192	66096	66096	I	884	“ You know , the whole day would have been better if I ’d been prepared . ”
66193	66202	66096	66096	I	884	“ Again , I thought you were brilliant . ”
66203	66227	66228	66228	I	884	“ Not on the inside . And it ’s the inside stuff that makes me do crazy things . Like stalk office buildings . ”
66270	66285	66263	66263	Hudson	1556	“ Anyway , I have you trapped in a car for over two hours — ”
66286	66297	66314	66314	his	884	“ Are you sure I do n’t have you trapped ? ”
66298	66309	66263	66263	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re driving . I ’m providing the entertainment . ”
66322	66330	66331	66331	He	884	“ I like the sound of that . ”
66389	66408	66409	66409	I	884	“ Stop interrupting . We are playing a get - to - know - each - other game . ”
66420	66463	66409	66409	I	884	“ Do n’t even say whatever it is you ’re about to say . If we have any hope of fooling your family when we ’re with them twenty - four / seven then we need to know more about each other . ”
66464	66472	66475	66475	his	884	“ I already know plenty about you . ”
66487	66494	66495	66495	I	884	“ No , you do n’t . ”
66510	66528	66495	66495	I	884	“ Have you ever gotten to know a woman — nonsexually ? Besides from a background check ? ”
66529	66534	66495	66495	I	884	“ Not on purpose . ”
66548	66558	66535	66535	His	884	“ Hudson , you ’re kind of an asshole . ”
66559	66566	66567	66567	He	884	“ So I ’ve been told . ”
66573	66585	66567	66567	He	884	“ Fine . How do we play this game of yours ? ”
66593	66636	66535	66535	His	884	“ We ’ll take turns . On your turn you can either ask a question or tell a fact about yourself . Your choice . Nothing too heavy . Basic stuff . I ’ll go first . I do n’t like mushrooms . ”
66641	66654	66637	66637	His	884	“ You do n’t like mushrooms ? What is wrong with you ? ”
66655	66666	66637	66637	His	884	“ They ’re gross . They taste like rotten olives . ”
66667	66674	66637	66637	His	884	“ They taste nothing like olives . ”
66675	66688	66689	66689	I	884	“ They taste like rotten olives . I ca n’t stand them . ”
66744	66760	66733	66733	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s a terrible inconvenience . That has to hinder your fine dining experiences . ”
66761	66767	66733	66733	Hudson	1556	“ Tell me about it . ”
66784	66803	66733	66733	Hudson	1556	“ Imagine my horror when my senior prom date made dinner for me and it was chicken Marsala . ”
66811	66823	66824	66824	His	884	“ Your senior prom date ? Was this a serious relationship ? ”
66840	66850	66837	66837	he	884	“ Are you asking that question for your turn ? ”
66851	66861	66824	66824	His	884	“ Uh , yes , I suppose I am . ”
66877	66890	66873	66873	I	884	“ It was a serious relationship for me . Not for Joe . ”
66891	66896	66898	66898	his	884	“ Joe sounds terrible . ”
66902	66909	66910	66910	Hudson	1556	“ Thank you . He was . ”
66925	66929	66917	66917	I	884	“ My turn . ”
66956	66967	66968	66968	He	884	“ Why do you never call people by their nicknames ? ”
66971	66993	66968	66968	He	884	“ Because nicknames are so gaudy . Call a person by their given name . That ’s why they have it . ”
67053	67062	67045	67045	him	884	“ But nicknames show a degree of familiarity . ”
67063	67079	67083	67083	Alayna	8844	“ You tell everyone to call you Laynie . Even people you ’ve just met . ”
67100	67110	67111	67111	I	884	“ Maybe I feel familiar with everyone I meet . ”
67132	67141	67111	67111	I	884	“ And you call Celia by a nickname . ”
67142	67145	67146	67146	He	1545	“ Really ? ”
67159	67194	67152	67152	I	884	“ She ’s the only person on earth , Alayna . I ’ve known her my whole life . I did n’t even know her name was really Celia until I was almost ten . ”
67216	67246	67248	67248	I	884	“ If you are trying to convince people you care more about me than Celia , then you should have a nickname for me . It will establish endearment . ”
67254	67263	67264	67264	My	884	“ Calling me ‘ H ’ shows endearment ? ”
67291	67318	67283	67283	Hudson	1556	“ It does . I do n’t go for the real lovey - dovey words like sweetie and honey . But Hudson is way too formal . ”
67319	67324	67271	67271	I	884	“ I like formal . ”
67325	67344	67283	67283	Hudson	1556	“ I like cherry - flavored blow pops . It does n’t make them appropriate for every situation . ”
67345	67349	67271	67271	I	884	“ Blow pops ? ”
67350	67356	67357	67357	I	884	“ Yeah … blow pops . ”
67448	67457	67458	67458	Hudson	1556	“ You did n’t like ‘ baby ’ ? ”
67478	67483	67473	67473	I	884	“ Not so much . ”
67504	67511	67473	67473	I	884	“ I ’m sticking with Alayna . ”
67519	67540	67512	67512	I	884	“ Come on . You could call me ‘ precious ’ every now and then in front of other people . ”
67541	67545	67546	67546	he	1286	“ No way , ”
67549	67559	67512	67512	I	884	“ Why ? You call me that sometimes already . ”
67569	67574	67560	67560	His	1286	“ That ’s private . ”
67637	67643	67632	67632	I	884	“ It ’s your turn . ”
67715	67721	67706	67706	he	1286	“ Who keeps texting you ? ”
67732	67738	67724	67724	his	1286	“ Is that your question ? ”
67739	67743	67706	67706	he	1286	“ It is . ”
67771	67780	67816	67816	Hudson	1556	“ My brother . He ’s an asshole . ”
67781	67788	67789	67789	he	1286	“ Like I ’m an asshole ? ”
67802	67815	67816	67816	Hudson	1556	“ Worse . He ’s an asshole who does n’t know it . ”
67819	67826	67816	67816	Hudson	1556	“ And you ’re ignoring Brian ? ”
67883	67904	67874	67874	he	1286	“ You already asked your question . It ’s my turn . I lost my virginity when I was sixteen . ”
67937	67954	67933	67933	I	884	“ Sixteen ? Fuck , Alayna . I do n’t think I want to know that . ”
67955	67958	67959	67959	I	884	“ Sorry . ”
67971	67987	67962	67962	He	1286	“ I seriously doubt this is going to come up in conversation with my family . ”
67988	67993	67962	67962	He	1286	“ You never know . ”
67994	68000	67962	67962	He	1286	“ Who was the guy ? ”
68007	68013	68001	68001	His	1286	“ Is that your turn ? ”
68014	68017	67962	67962	He	1286	“ No . ”
68038	68041	68027	68027	He	1286	“ Yes . ”
68052	68083	68042	68042	I	884	“ He was a random guy I met at a party . I thought that having sex would help me forget that my parents had died . It did not . ”
68084	68093	68094	68094	He	1286	“ No , I suppose it would n’t . ”
68289	68297	68277	68277	I	884	“ What were you doing in Cincinnati ? ”
68298	68301	68302	68302	I	884	“ Business . ”
68330	68340	68277	68277	I	884	“ That ’s not very much of an answer . ”
68341	68352	68277	68277	I	884	“ I would n’t talk to my girlfriend about business . ”
68353	68365	68277	68277	I	884	“ You would n’t be my boyfriend if you did n’t . ”
68393	68407	68387	68387	I	884	“ Did n’t your mom and dad talk about business with each other ? ”
68408	68444	68277	68277	I	884	“ My parents do n’t talk about anything . If Dad ’s at the house when we get there , he will not sleep in the same room with Mother . Loveless marriage , remember ? ”
68445	68452	68453	68453	I	884	“ Not a good example then . ”
68459	68476	68453	68453	I	884	“ Look . I ’m a business major . I like to know about these things . ”
68483	68493	68453	68453	I	884	“ Does n’t my smart mind turn you on ? ”
68494	68502	68504	68504	he	1555	“ Your smart mind , not mine . ”
68518	68532	68510	68510	I	884	“ Come on . I ’ve shown you mine . Show me yours . ”
68546	68583	68543	68543	He	1555	“ There ’s been some outside interest in Plexis , one of my smaller companies . But I ’m not keen to sell to this particular buyer . The other members of the board feel differently . ”
68600	68656	68596	68596	he	1555	“ Actually it ’s been quite stressful , fighting to keep Plexis together when so many are opposed . Many stand to gain a sizable profit from a sale . I know that this buyer would run the place to the ground . The company would be torn apart . People would lose their jobs . ”
68753	68763	68746	68746	I	884	“ Thank you ! Was that really so terrible ? ”
68781	68794	68795	68795	He	1555	“ I ’m not answering that . It ’s not your turn . ”
68804	68823	68795	68795	He	1555	“ Fine . It was n’t that terrible . That ’s what I ’m offering for my turn . ”
68824	68827	68828	68828	I	884	“ Hudson ? ”
68851	68856	68795	68795	He	1555	“ Yes , precious ? ”
68857	68865	68795	68795	He	1555	“ You are n’t really an asshole . ”
68874	68883	68866	68866	He	1555	“ Shh . You ’ll ruin my reputation . ”
69195	69200	69201	69201	he	884	“ We ’re here , ”
69306	69311	69312	69312	Hudson	1556	“ It’s … wow . ”
69315	69325	69312	69312	Hudson	1556	“ Come on . You ’ll love the inside . ”
69368	69374	69375	69375	Hudson	1556	“ Good evening , Martin , ”
69385	69400	69375	69375	Hudson	1556	“ This is my girlfriend , Alayna Withers . Martin is our household assistant . ”
69401	69408	69409	69409	Martin	168	“ A pleasure , Ms. Withers , ”
69426	69444	69421	69421	he	168	“ Mr. Pierce , I ’ll set your bags in the guest suite in the west wing . ”
69457	69465	69445	69445	Hudson	1556	“ Is everyone in the west wing ? ”
69466	69471	69445	69445	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , sir . ”
69472	69485	69445	69445	Hudson	1556	“ Then set us up in the master of the east wing . ”
69529	69538	69539	69539	Mirabelle	1120	“ Hudson , we ’re in the kitchen , ”
69550	69557	69558	69558	Hudson	1556	“ I know it ’s late , ”
69569	69582	69558	69558	Hudson	1556	“ but we should at least say hello . Do you mind ? ”
69616	69624	69605	69605	I	884	“ It ’s not late for me . ”
69634	69637	69631	69631	Hudson	1556	“ Good . ”
69849	69854	69855	69855	Mira	8319	“ I ’m pregnant , ”
69862	69873	69855	69855	Mira	8319	“ I do n’t know what Adam ’s excuse is . ”
69874	69883	69884	69884	Hudson	1556	“ Was that one of Millie ’s pies ? ”
69890	69919	69855	69855	Mira	8319	“ Then there ’s his excuse right there . No one makes better pies than Millie . I ca n’t believe you did n’t save any for us . ”
69920	69927	69928	69928	Adam	700	“ There ’s more for tomorrow , ”
69932	69946	69947	69947	he	700	“ We were strictly forbidden to touch them . Millie ’s our cook , ”
69953	69958	69947	69947	he	700	“ She ’s amazing . ”
69959	69969	69970	69970	Mira	8319	“ Now that the little one ’s been fed , ”
69977	69987	69970	69970	Mira	8319	“ I can give a proper greeting . Laynie ! ”
69995	70003	69970	69970	Mira	8319	“ I ’m so glad you came ! ”
70004	70008	70009	70009	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
70017	70030	69970	69970	Mira	8319	“ How was the trip ? Did you get anything to eat ? ”
70031	70040	70041	70041	Adam	700	“ Are you offering to fix them something ? ”
70053	70059	70041	70041	Adam	700	“ Mira does n’t cook . ”
70069	70080	70060	70060	She	8319	“ I know how to use the microwave , though . ”
70081	70093	70094	70094	Hudson	1556	“ No need to prove anything . We stopped in Sayville , ”
70097	70108	70109	70109	Mira	8319	“ The clam bar ? Ooh , I ’m jealous . ”
70127	70146	70109	70109	Mira	8319	“ I ’m still glad you ’re here . It ’s been ages since you ’ve come out . ”
70157	70166	70147	70147	Hudson	1556	“ I am too . Did Dad come ? ”
70187	70214	70167	70167	Mira	8319	“ Yeah , he ’s already gone to bed for the night . Or he ’s hiding from Mom . He ’s in the guest house . ”
70232	70240	70215	70215	I	884	“ Where is Mother ? And Chandler ? ”
70241	70246	70247	70247	I	884	“ I ’m here . ”
70277	70294	70261	70261	She	1858	“ Chandler ’s out with the Gardiner girl . I do n’t expect him until late . ”
70295	70300	70301	70301	Hudson	1556	“ Hello , Mother . ”
70313	70318	70319	70319	Sophia	1858	“ You made it . ”
70324	70329	70319	70319	Sophia	1858	“ Both of you . ”
70330	70338	70339	70339	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna and I are seldom apart , ”
70347	70354	70355	70355	I	884	“ Good evening , Mrs. Pierce . ”
70380	70392	70373	70373	Hudson	1556	“ Thank you for the invite . Your house is lovely . ”
70396	70417	70393	70393	She	1858	“ I ’m sure you want to get settled . I chose a room for you in the west wing . ”
70421	70436	70418	70418	Hudson	1556	“ I told Martin to set up the master suite in the east wing . ”
70538	70552	70553	70553	Her	1858	“ Hudson , that ’s so far away from the rest of us . ”
70611	70619	70620	70620	His	0	“ We need the distance , Mother . ”
70625	70633	70620	70620	His	0	“ Why ? We do n’t bite . ”
70634	70638	70639	70639	he	0	“ Alayna does , ”
70643	70651	70639	70639	he	0	“ And she can be quite loud . ”
70706	70731	70695	70695	her	1858	“ Oh , Mother , do n’t look at me like that . Neither Alayna nor I have been virgins since we were sixteen . ”
70772	70788	70751	70751	Hudson	1556	“ Well , what do you know ? That virginity fact did come in handy . ”
70808	70816	70817	70817	He	0	“ Do n’t get pissy , Alayna . ”
70837	70849	70817	70817	He	0	“ Trust me — we want a room away from them . ”
70894	70915	70879	70879	he	0	“ We ’ll see you in the morning . It ’s late and we ’d like to get to bed . ”
71262	71273	71254	71254	I	884	“ Am I off - duty or on - duty ? ”
71281	71288	71291	71291	he	0	“ My family ’s not around . ”
71298	71328	71291	71291	he	0	“ Off - duty . Besides , I told you I ’d never use sex as part of the sham and I intend to have sex with you now . ”
71346	71349	71291	71291	he	0	“ Really ? ”
71350	71354	71355	71355	He	0	“ Of course . ”
71383	71392	71376	71376	I	884	“ We ’ve never spent the night together . ”
71393	71399	71400	71400	He	0	“ So we have n’t . ”
71413	71418	71400	71400	He	0	“ Are you nervous ? ”
71421	71424	71376	71376	I	884	“ No . ”
71435	71458	71425	71425	His	0	“ You should be . You ’ll be within my reach all night long . I expect you ’ll be sore tomorrow . ”
71469	71475	71459	71459	My	884	“ Hmm . Sounds lovely . ”
71476	71485	71486	71486	He	0	“ Good . Go get ready for bed . ”
71495	71510	71486	71486	He	0	“ Do n’t take too long . I ’m eager to lick you senseless . ”
71812	71816	71817	71817	He	1603	“ Nice choice . ”
71831	71835	71836	71836	His	1603	“ Come here . ”
71914	71918	71919	71919	he	1603	“ So beautiful , ”
71929	71937	71938	71938	I	884	“ I need to make you come . ”
71951	71956	71957	71957	He	1603	“ Over and over . ”
71963	71972	71957	71957	He	1603	“ Do you think you can handle it ? ”
72018	72039	72010	72010	his	1603	“ You do n’t know if you can handle it , do you , precious ? Let ’s find out . ”
72302	72308	72299	72299	I	884	“ That was … incredible . ”
72340	72347	72327	72327	He	1603	“ What was your favorite part ? ”
72470	72477	72463	72463	I	884	“ What was your favorite part ? ”
72486	72501	72478	72478	He	1603	“ The way you respond to anything … everything … I do to you . ”
72522	72526	72516	72516	he	1603	“ Your turn . ”
72539	72545	72546	72546	I	884	“ I ’ll never tell . ”
72549	72553	72554	72554	He	1603	“ Tell me . ”
72598	72602	72593	72593	I	884	“ Make me . ”
72603	72612	72613	72613	His	1603	“ I ca n’t make you do anything . ”
72624	72630	72631	72631	I	884	“ I think you could . ”
72638	72651	72631	72631	I	884	“ I hear you ’re quite good at making women do things . ”
72733	72743	72717	72717	His	1603	“ I am good at making women do things . ”
72756	72761	72750	72750	I	884	“ But not me . ”
72762	72765	72766	72766	His	1603	“ No . ”
72774	72778	72766	72766	His	1603	“ Not you . ”
72779	72784	72785	72785	I	884	“ Am I not … ”
72808	72819	72800	72800	I	884	“ … intriguing … enough to play that game with ? ”
72843	72871	72872	72872	His	1603	“ God , Alayna , do you want me to do that to you ? Possess you ? I would crush you . I would destroy you . ”
72882	72889	72872	72872	His	1603	“ Is that what you want ? ”
72902	72943	72894	72894	I	884	“ No , but a little bit yes too . That ’s how my stupid brain works . If you do n’t do with me what you normally do with other girls , there must be something wrong with me . ”
72956	72984	72947	72947	he	1603	“ Oh , it ’s all you , huh ? It ’s not that there ’s something wrong with me ? How self - centered of you . ”
72997	73019	72989	72989	I	884	“ I ’m very self - centered . I want to be special . I ’m afraid that I ’m not . ”
73020	73024	73025	73025	His	1603	“ You are . ”
73030	73040	73041	73041	He	1603	“ Even more than you could imagine you are . ”
73051	73074	73041	73041	He	1603	“ Because I do n’t want to destroy you more than I need to possess you . That ’s progress for me . ”
73129	73155	73117	73117	I	884	“ Then I ’ll try not to fixate on what it means that I ’m different for you . That will be progress for me . ”
73167	73176	73156	73156	He	1603	“ Do you know why you do it ? ”
73177	73185	73156	73156	He	1603	“ Why I become obsessive about guys ? ”
73186	73189	73156	73156	He	1603	“ Yeah . ”
73190	73239	73156	73156	He	1603	“ My counselors have said it ’s probably about not feeling loved as a child . Aggravated by the early death of my parents . So I ’m constantly seeking affection and doubting it when I receive it because I do n’t know what it really feels like . ”
73240	73248	73156	73156	He	1603	“ How did you get over that ? ”
73295	73326	73277	73277	I	884	“ I have n’t . It ’s a constant battle . Lots of self - affirmation . Lots of silly little tricks , like wearing elastic bands to remind me . ”
73338	73346	73327	73327	He	1603	“ You still fall into old habits . ”
73347	73350	73327	73327	He	1603	“ Yes . ”
73351	73355	73327	73327	He	1603	“ With me ? ”
73356	73364	73365	73365	My	884	“ You know the answer to that . ”
73398	73428	73390	73390	I	884	“ I did n’t believe you were away on business . I thought you did n’t want to see me . That ’s why I came by your building . ”
73476	73486	73457	73457	He	1603	“ Alayna , I will never lie to you . ”
73492	73513	73487	73487	His	1603	“ Not when we ’re off - duty . I will always tell you the truth . I swear it . ”
73527	73532	73514	73514	His	1603	“ Do you understand ? ”
73542	73547	73548	73548	I	884	“ Hudson , this , ”
73557	73564	73548	73548	I	884	“ This was my favorite part . ”
73927	73934	73935	73935	he	1617	“ Good , you ’re awake , ”
73953	73987	73988	73988	He	1617	“ I ’m showing my family what an awesome boyfriend I am by bringing you breakfast in bed . Omelets . Sans mushrooms , of course . No cherry - flavored blow pops . ”
74003	74033	73988	73988	He	1617	“ This is one of those inappropriate moments for a blow pop anyway . And you should have said amazingly awesome boyfriend . Breakfast in bed is the best . ”
74052	74059	74060	74060	He	1617	“ I ’m not that awesome . ”
74095	74106	74085	74085	He	1617	“ I ’m going to make you eat it cold . ”
74119	74125	74116	74116	I	884	“ Cold breakfast sounds perfect . ”
74321	74341	74342	74342	Sophia	1858	“ — did n’t invite you so you could stay in your room all day and fuck like bunnies , ”
74365	74373	74374	74374	Hudson	1556	“ Then why did you invite us ? ”
74442	74475	74429	74429	I	884	“ I invited you because I think she — any woman you involve yourself with , for that matter — has a right to be protected . Has a right to know . ”
74476	74484	74485	74485	He	1617	“ Her name is Alayna , Mother . ”
74495	74501	74502	74502	He	1617	“ And she already knows . ”
74506	74529	74502	74502	He	1617	“ I love how you believe no one could possibly feel something for me because of who I was in the past . ”
74662	74692	74654	74654	Sophia	1858	“ — ca n’t understand how you could tell her ? What if she exposes you ? Exposes us ? Our family does n’t need that kind of scandal . ”
74693	74707	74654	74654	Sophia	1858	“ My life is more than a scandal waiting to happen , Mother . ”
74708	74737	74654	74654	Sophia	1858	“ Your life is a series of scandals . Scandals that your father and I are continuously cleaning up . Your bartender whore is just the next scandal . ”
74779	74797	74752	74752	Sophia	1858	“ Do n’t you dare talk about Alayna like that again . If you do , I — “
74798	74804	74752	74752	Sophia	1858	“ Finding out anything good ? ”
74944	74962	74920	74920	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m judging by the look on your face that you already know who I am . ”
74963	74971	74983	74983	He	1627	“ Yes . You ’re Jonathan Pierce . ”
74972	74982	74983	74983	He	1627	“ And you … hmm … don’t tell me … ”
75007	75051	75001	75001	I	884	“ You ’re a little old for Chandler , and Mira does n’t ever pick friends who are prettier than her . That leaves Hudson . I ’d heard a rumor he was dating someone , but I never imagined it was true . ”
75084	75094	75069	75069	His	1627	“ I ’m Hudson ’s girlfriend , Alayna Withers . ”
75103	75113	75095	75095	I	884	“ But please call me Laynie , Mr. Pierce . ”
75129	75149	75150	75150	He	1627	“ My friends call me Jack , and I have a feeling we ’re going to be great friends . ”
75185	75192	75177	75177	he	1627	“ Who ’s in there anyway ? ”
75200	75206	75177	75177	he	1627	“ Hudson and your wife . ”
75213	75226	75207	75207	Jack	10551	“ Please refrain from reminding me I ’m married to that woman . ”
75232	75253	75207	75207	Jack	10551	“ We obviously do n’t want to go in there . Have you been given a tour of Mabel Shores ? ”
75254	75258	75207	75207	Jack	10551	“ Mabel Shores ? ”
75259	75292	75293	75293	He	1627	“ If Hudson has n’t told you the name of this house , he ’s certainly not given you a tour . How lucky that I ’m available to do the honor . ”
75299	75303	75293	75293	He	1627	“ Shall we ? ”
75615	75627	75610	75610	Jack	10551	“ So you and Hudson … that ’s a pleasant surprise . ”
75628	75644	75610	75610	Jack	10551	“ I ’m not sure that I want to know what ’s surprising about us . ”
75645	75679	75610	75610	Jack	10551	“ Nothing bad . Hudson does n’t date much . I ’m glad to see that the girl he finally brought home is someone as delightful as you . I hope it sticks . ”
75683	75687	75680	75680	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
75705	75722	75680	75680	I	884	“ I ’m quite stuck on the man . I ’ve fallen for him pretty hard . ”
75732	75746	75723	75723	Jack	10551	“ Yes , I believe you have . That ’s wonderful . Truly . ”
75809	75824	75794	75794	Jack	10551	“ What was Sophia saying about you ? I ’ve been dying to ask . ”
75825	75830	75831	75831	I	884	“ When ? Oh . ”
75856	75873	75847	75847	He	10551	“ It had to be not very nice . You were ashen when I found you . ”
75894	75901	75874	75874	I	884	“ She does n’t like me . ”
75905	75912	75913	75913	He	10551	“ Sophia does n’t like anyone . ”
75941	75963	75927	75927	I	884	“ But I imagine she especially does n’t like you . Which is why it ’s so delicious that I do . ”
75973	75984	75968	75968	I	884	“ Is it because of me or because of Hudson ? ”
75985	75999	76047	76048	Bartender whore	1657	“ The reasons I like you have absolutely nothing to do with Hudson . ”
76010	76028	76000	76000	I	884	“ I was talking about Sophia — your wife . Why does she especially not like me ? ”
76040	76046	76029	76029	Jack	10551	“ It is n’t you . ”
76064	76078	76050	76050	I	884	“ Really ? I bet she ’d welcome Celia into Hudson ’s arms . ”
76079	76088	76054	76054	Sophia	1858	“ Because she adores Celia . Always has . ”
76120	76130	76106	76106	I	884	“ Does n’t she want Hudson to be happy ? ”
76153	76184	76131	76131	Jack	10551	“ She does n’t want anyone to be happy . Particularly Hudson . They ’ve had many battles in a lifelong war , and she ’s not a forgiving woman . ”
76298	76309	76281	76281	I	884	“ Then there ’s no way to win her over ? ”
76310	76313	76314	76314	His	1286	“ No . ”
76343	76352	76329	76329	I	884	“ Your son seems to think there is . ”
76366	76380	76353	76353	Jack	10551	“ That ’s too bad . I thought he was long past caring . ”
76433	76460	76461	76461	He	1286	“ Now , I on the other hand , am very easy to win over . I can give you some ideas if you need them . ”
76479	76487	76464	76464	I	884	“ I ’ve already won you over . ”
76492	76504	76488	76488	He	1286	“ Damn . I ’ve never had a good poker face . ”
76505	76516	76488	76488	He	1286	“ But I bet you still win plenty of hands . ”
76517	76526	76527	76527	He	1286	“ Shall we play later and find out ? ”
76537	76547	76527	76527	He	1286	“ Alone ? In the guest house ? Strip ? ”
76552	76575	76548	76548	I	884	“ I ’ll play in the main house , you dirty old man . With others present and all our clothing on . ”
76576	76584	76527	76527	He	1286	“ You just killed all the fun . ”
76610	76615	76616	76616	He	1286	“ There you are . ”
76630	76643	76616	76616	He	1286	“ I was worried and now I see I should have been . ”
76644	76649	76650	76650	I	884	“ I ’m fine . ”
76666	76683	76650	76650	I	884	“ Jack ’s been showing me around Mabel Shores . I ’ve had an amazing time . ”
76690	76702	76684	76684	Hudson	1556	“ Then he has n’t tried to come on to you ? ”
76703	76709	76710	76710	I	884	“ No , he has . ”
76716	76723	76710	76710	I	884	“ But we ’re all good . ”
76759	76780	76756	76756	Jack	10551	“ I ’m telling you , Laynie , with age comes experience . If you really want an amazing time … ”
76786	76793	76781	76781	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t like this . ”
76808	76819	76794	76794	Jack	10551	“ Relax , Hudson . It ’s all in fun . ”
76839	76860	76834	76834	Hudson	1556	“ We ’re fine , H. He knows I ’m hopelessly devoted to you . Do n’t you , Jack ? ”
76861	76865	76866	76866	He	1286	“ I do . ”
76872	76880	76866	76866	He	1286	“ I wonder if my son does . ”
76998	77010	77011	77011	I	884	“ Lunch is ready . Should I serve it out here ? ”
77076	77084	77085	77085	Jack	10551	“ Millie , you ’re an angel , ”
77088	77096	77085	77085	Jack	10551	“ Out here is a terrific idea . ”
77097	77110	77121	77121	her	1668	“ I ’ll let Adam and Chandler know they should join you . ”
77228	77237	77238	77238	Adam	700	“ They ’re out shopping for baby stuff , ”
77255	77277	77247	77247	He	700	“ Mira wanted to invite you . She looked for you before she left , but she could n’t find you . ”
77278	77296	77297	77297	Jack	10551	“ Darn . That must have been when we were touring the grounds . Sorry , Laynie . ”
77315	77331	77305	77305	My	884	“ Fuck that . Like I ’d go anywhere with Sophia , let alone shopping . ”
77340	77343	77332	77332	I	884	“ Sorry ! ”
77369	77377	77378	77378	Adam	700	“ I ’m totally with you there , ”
77385	77396	77397	77397	Chandler	676	“ I think Mom feels the same way about you , ”
77411	77424	77397	77397	Chandler	676	“ She seemed to be glad when Mira could n’t find you . ”
77425	77428	77429	77429	Hudson	1556	“ Chandler . ”
77436	77442	77443	77443	I	884	“ It ’s okay , H. ”
77472	77490	77462	77462	his	700	“ Your mother and I are a long way from friendly . It ’s not a secret . ”
77798	77802	77786	77786	Hudson	1556	“ Game over ? ”
77803	77807	77808	77808	I	884	“ For me . ”
77822	77830	77831	77831	He	676	“ Wow , H. You ’re tense . ”
77845	77853	77831	77831	He	676	“ What ’s getting you stressed out ? ”
77898	77904	77905	77905	He	676	“ This situation with Plexis . ”
77965	77994	77960	77960	My	884	“ The board is moving to sell . I need to come up with an attractive proposal to convince them it ’s more profitable to keep the company . ”
78030	78036	78037	78037	I	884	“ You ’re redistributing production ? ”
78060	78087	78048	78048	I	884	“ You ’d make a whole lot more if you moved those North America lines to your Indonesia plant . You ’re far from capacity there . ”
78088	78110	78045	78045	his	676	“ Oh , you ’re one of those types who resort to taking jobs away from American people to cut costs . ”
78111	78115	78116	78116	I	884	“ Not usually , ”
78136	78166	78116	78116	I	884	“ But you ’re going to lose all your USA jobs if you do n’t do something , right ? Losing a few is better than losing them all . ”
78167	78170	78171	78171	he	676	“ Yes , ”
78217	78223	78224	78224	He	676	“ Take a deep breath . ”
78242	78245	78246	78246	he	676	“ Thanks , ”
78262	78267	78256	78256	I	884	“ You ’re welcome . ”
78292	78295	78296	78296	I	884	“ Besides , ”
78307	78349	78296	78296	I	884	“ if you start producing this energy efficient bulb in the American plant in its place , you ’ll maintain those jobs and save money with that new tax law . Plus you ’ll get a tax break for employing Americans . ”
78355	78363	78350	78350	Hudson	1556	“ That law only benefits new companies . ”
78364	78386	78350	78350	Hudson	1556	“ No , it benefits any product that has n’t been produced in the U.S. before , new company or not . ”
78387	78396	78350	78350	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t think that ’s correct . ”
78428	78440	78422	78422	His	676	“ Do you have a copy of the current tax code ? ”
78441	78450	78451	78451	Hudson	1556	“ On my Kindle . Under there somewhere . ”
78483	78494	78465	78465	I	884	“ Would n’t you be more comfortable at a table ? ”
78507	78515	78504	78504	he	676	“ I wanted to be near you . ”
78547	78556	78557	78557	I	884	“ I like being near you , too , ”
78608	78613	78614	78614	he	676	“ Well , well , ”
78621	78630	78614	78614	he	676	“ Looks like you ’re onto something here . ”
78669	78672	78658	78658	his	676	“ What ? ”
78678	78681	78673	78673	He	676	“ Nothing . ”
78691	78705	78688	78688	he	676	“ Would you mind sharing your thoughts on the rest of my proposal ? ”
78923	78930	78920	78920	I	884	“ Is it close to dinnertime ? ”
78937	78949	78934	78934	Mira	8319	“ I was just coming to tell you dinner is served . ”
78950	78965	78920	78920	I	884	“ I did n’t realize you were home . When did you get back ? ”
78966	78987	78934	78934	Mira	8319	“ A few minutes ago . Mom has a headache but everyone else is already waiting in the dining room . ”
78988	78994	78995	78995	I	884	“ A headache , huh ? ”
79035	79047	79048	79048	His	1691	“ She ’s known to get them from time to time . ”
79121	79145	79114	79114	he	676	“ All right , Alayna . Tell me something you need to see off your list and we ’ll download it from iTunes . ”
79196	79199	79193	79193	He	676	“ boyfriend , ”
79224	79234	79235	79235	I	884	“ Are you going to watch it , too ? ”
79252	79256	79257	79257	He	676	“ I am . ”
79486	79504	79505	79505	He	700	“ H , you ’re a workaholic . Are you going to be at it all night ? ”
79515	79558	79505	79505	He	700	“ Oh , precious , work is not what I ’ll be at all night . But I need a few minutes to send this new proposal to the board before I can devote my attention to you . Do you mind ? ”
79559	79571	79572	79572	I	884	“ Take your time . I ’ll get ready for bed . ”
80041	80046	80047	80047	Sophia	1858	“ Where ’s Hudson ? ”
80112	80119	80120	80120	I	884	“ He’s … he fell asleep . ”
80216	80226	80205	80205	her	1858	“ He does n’t love you , you know ? ”
80247	80251	80239	80239	I	884	“ Pardon me ? ”
80252	80257	80258	80258	She	1858	“ He ca n’t . ”
80275	80280	80258	80258	She	1858	“ He ’s incapable . ”
80334	80345	80346	80346	Her	1858	“ Maybe you ’re projecting your own incapability of emotion . ”
80358	80387	80346	80346	Her	1858	“ Your words ca n’t touch me , Ms. Withers . This is my house , Hudson is my son . I ’m the one in power here . ”
80388	80392	80346	80346	Her	1858	“ Fuck you . ”
80396	80407	80393	80393	She	1858	“ He ’s had years of therapy . Extensive therapy . ”
80441	80447	80437	80437	I	884	“ He ’s told me . ”
80448	80460	80461	80461	She	1858	“ Has he ? But he has n’t shared the details . ”
80491	80514	80480	80480	She	1858	“ If he had , you ’d know he ca n’t love anyone . He ’s sociopathic . Diagnosed at age twenty . ”
80531	80538	80540	80540	he	1714	“ Hudson ’s not a sociopath . ”
80542	80570	80571	80571	She	1858	“ He ’s deceitful and manipulative , egocentric , grandiose , glib and superficial . Incapable of remorse . He engages in casual and impersonal sexual relationships . ”
80591	80619	80571	80571	She	1858	“ Look it up — he fits the definition to a tee . He has no concern for others ’ feelings . He ca n’t love anyone . ”
80620	80627	80629	80629	my	884	“ I do n’t believe that . ”
80633	80639	80571	80571	She	1858	“ You ’re extremely naïve . ”
80640	80647	80648	80648	I	884	“ You ’re an extreme bitch . ”
80691	80701	80702	80702	She	1858	“ He ’s only with you for the sex . ”
80714	80719	80702	80702	She	1858	“ You ’re attractive . ”
80728	80744	80720	80720	Her	1858	“ And clearly his type . He seems to like fucking buxom brunettes the most . ”
80791	80807	80781	80781	I	884	“ If it was just sex , he ’d never bring me to meet you . ”
80812	80853	80854	80854	She	1858	“ That ’s an added bonus for him . He can rile me up and get his kicks with you all at once . It really has nothing to do with you . It ’s about me and my son . ”
80871	80880	80854	80854	She	1858	“ You , Ms. Withers , are insignificant . ”
80931	80934	80935	80935	Chandler	676	“ Mom ? ”
80953	80956	80957	80957	he	676	“ Laynie , ”
80976	80987	80957	80957	he	676	“ I did n’t know anyone else was out here . ”
80988	80999	81000	81000	Sophia	1858	“ Alayna and I were getting to know each other . ”
81023	81035	81014	81014	I	884	“ The pool ’s all yours . I ’m done here . ”
81354	81357	81358	81358	I	884	“ Alayna ? ”
81369	81374	81360	81360	Hudson	1556	“ Is that you ? ”
81375	81378	81379	81379	I	884	“ Yeah . ”
81397	81410	81379	81379	I	884	“ I was n’t tired , so I went for a swim . ”
81427	81435	81436	81436	He	1733	“ Good , I ’m glad you … ”
81444	81451	81436	81436	He	1733	“ Hey , what ’s wrong ? ”
81452	81455	81457	81457	I	884	“ Nothing . ”
81471	81482	81436	81436	He	1733	“ Your eyes are red . You ’ve been crying . ”
81483	81495	81496	81496	I	884	“ No , no . The chlorine . Bothers my eyes . ”
81607	81619	81604	81604	I	884	“ Um , I ’m going to jump in the shower . ”
81620	81626	81604	81604	I	884	“ I ’ll join you . ”
81777	81780	81781	81781	He	1733	“ Alayna ? ”
81793	81801	81781	81781	He	1733	“ Something ’s wrong . Tell me . ”
81802	81810	81811	81811	I	884	“ I ’m fine . I just … ”
81864	81869	81855	81855	I	884	“ I need you . ”
81881	81888	81890	81890	he	1733	“ I ’m here , precious . ”
82173	82179	82180	82180	He	0	“ Good morning , precious . ”
82206	82213	82180	82180	He	0	“ Did you get enough sleep ? ”
82214	82218	82192	82192	he	0	“ I did . ”
82365	82376	82343	82343	I	884	“ Hudson ? Are you going to work all day ? ”
82392	82399	82377	82377	He	0	“ Does my working bother you ? ”
82400	82409	82410	82410	I	884	“ Not really . But I was thinking ... ”
82419	82441	82410	82410	I	884	“ I did n’t really see your mother yesterday . Should n’t we try to spend some time with her today ? ”
82445	82455	82442	82442	He	0	“ I do n’t know if that ’s necessary . ”
82500	82517	82490	82490	We	1744	“ Is n’t she the person we need to be impressing with our fabulous relationship sham ? ”
82518	82525	82526	82526	He	0	“ Being here together is enough . ”
82564	82572	82573	82573	He	0	“ No , it ’s not enough . ”
82581	82634	82573	82573	He	0	“ I think we should go at her gangbusters . Throw ourselves in her face . You need to ignore your work to make it really convincing , though . Show her that you ’re so in love you ca n’t even concentrate on business . You can only think of me . ”
82648	82656	82635	82635	Hudson	1556	“ What ? Not a good idea ? ”
82660	82668	82657	82657	He	0	“ It could be a good idea . ”
82683	82700	82669	82669	He	0	“ But do you really want to spend time with my mother ? She can be ... ”
82701	82706	82657	82657	He	0	“ A total bitch ? ”
82707	82722	82669	82669	He	0	“ I was going to say abrasive , but your words fit as well . ”
82764	82777	82740	82740	she	1858	“ It ’s only two more days . I can handle it . ”
82788	82797	82778	82778	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re pretty incredible , you know ? ”
82803	82821	82778	82778	Hudson	1556	“ Actually , I ’m finding it hard to concentrate on anything but your beautiful naked breasts . ”
82850	82891	82846	82846	I	884	“ No , no , no . We ca n’t stay locked up in here all morning . We have to be downstairs , in the public eye . Or the Sophia eye , anyway . What time is breakfast ? ”
82895	82900	82892	82892	He	884	“ Eight - thirty . ”
82901	82912	82913	82913	I	884	“ Damn , I ’ll have to shower afterward then . ”
82927	82939	82913	82913	I	884	“ Hope no one minds me smelling like sweat and sex . ”
82947	82955	82940	82940	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m not going to complain . ”
82981	82995	82972	82972	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m warning you right now — I’m playing this full out . ”
83003	83015	82996	82996	I	884	“ Expect lots of fondling and touching and kissing and such . ”
83040	83066	83067	83067	He	884	“ Thank you for the warning . Though it should probably be me that initiates most of the fondling and touching and kissing and such . ”
83081	83098	83067	83067	He	884	“ Since it ’s my emotions we ’re trying to convince her of , not yours . ”
83140	83144	83130	83130	I	884	“ Good point . ”
83151	83158	83145	83145	I	884	“ But can you bring it ? ”
83159	83165	83130	83130	I	884	“ Are you challenging me ? ”
83166	83171	83172	83172	I	884	“ If it helps . ”
83182	83196	83130	83130	I	884	“ I do n’t need a challenge . I can totally bring it . ”
83230	83236	83225	83225	I	884	“ Game on , then ? ”
83237	83241	83244	83244	he	884	“ Game on . ”
83369	83381	83364	83364	Sophia	1858	“ Well , well . They managed to leave the bedroom . ”
83394	83397	83382	83382	Mira	8319	“ Mom ! ”
83453	83469	83439	83439	Sophia	1858	“ It ’s a fair observation . I did n’t expect them down this early . ”
83476	83486	83439	83439	Sophia	1858	“ Especially when Alayna was up so late swimming . ”
83588	83605	83606	83606	My	884	“ Hudson and I wanted to make sure we got to spend some time with you . ”
83619	83644	83606	83606	My	884	“ Are you feeling up to it ? I mean , you were up late , too . And you had that nasty headache . ”
83645	83660	83661	83661	Jack	10551	“ You ’d have fewer of those if you ’d lay off the sauce , ”
83669	83678	83664	83664	Sophia	1858	“ I am feeling better . Thank you . ”
83686	83702	83664	83664	Sophia	1858	“ And I never turn down time with my son . Please , join us . ”
83889	83892	83893	83893	I	884	“ So . ”
83904	83914	83893	83893	I	884	“ What ’s on the agenda for the day ? ”
83923	83939	83915	83915	Mira	8319	“ Adam and I want to hit the beach . Do n’t we , sweetie ? ”
83940	83944	83945	83945	Adam	700	“ Uh huh , ”
83981	84011	83975	83975	she	8319	“ It ’s perfect weather for it . We can relax and soak up some rays . Millie could pack us a lunch . Want to come with us ? ”
84046	84055	83975	83975	she	8319	“ I ’m up for it . Hudson ? ”
84073	84084	84064	84064	I	884	“ Wherever you are , baby , I ’m there . ”
84097	84108	84109	84109	Sophia	1858	“ Hudson , you ’ll get sand in your computer , ”
84112	84133	84134	84134	Her	1858	“ And we do n’t get great Wi - Fi down there . Would n’t you rather work up here ? ”
84176	84189	84165	84165	He	884	“ Actually , I ’m not doing any work today , Mother . ”
84208	84226	84190	84190	He	884	“ I promised Laynie I ’d give her my full attention for the rest of our trip . ”
84317	84322	84310	84310	I	884	“ Thank you , H. ”
84367	84372	84373	84373	he	884	“ It ’s nothing , ”
84376	84382	84373	84373	he	884	“ You ’re worth it . ”
84400	84409	84410	84410	Mira	8319	“ Mom ? Join us at the beach ? ”
84438	84444	84428	84428	Sophia	1858	“ Sure . Why not ? ”
84448	84463	84445	84445	Jack	10551	“ Sophia spending the day in the sand ? This I have to see . ”
84478	84481	84482	84482	Mira	8319	“ Adam , ”
84490	84504	84482	84482	Mira	8319	“ Go wake up Chandler . We can take the Jet Ski out . ”
84505	84510	84511	84511	Adam	700	“ Uh , okay . ”
84578	84594	84571	84571	Mira	8319	“ And Dad , if you wear a thong again , I swear to God … ”
84595	84598	84599	84599	He	700	“ Fine . ”
84606	84622	84599	84599	He	700	“ I ’ll dress like an old man . But only for you , ladybug . ”
84668	84671	84672	84672	she	1858	“ Hudson , ”
84676	84688	84672	84672	she	1858	“ The Werners are arriving at their Hampton house this evening . ”
84689	84694	84695	84695	He	700	“ That ’s nice . ”
84712	84720	84695	84695	He	700	“ Why are you telling me this ? ”
84739	84746	84752	84752	Sophia	1858	“ Celia ’s coming , too . ”
84756	84780	84752	84752	Sophia	1858	“ I know how long it ’s been since you ’ve gotten to spend time together so I invited her for brunch tomorrow . ”
84862	84871	84856	84856	Mira	8319	“ Mom ! Why would you do that ? ”
84897	84913	84872	84872	Jack	10551	“ Honestly , Mira , does this type of behavior from your mother surprise you ? ”
84922	84928	84914	84914	Sophia	1858	“ What did I do ? ”
84960	84995	84996	84996	She	1858	“ Anyway , we ’ve been talking about redecorating the main rooms . I figured this was a great opportunity for her to show us some ideas while catching up with her dear friend . ”
85004	85028	84996	84996	She	1858	“ Alayna , you ’ve met Celia . Did you know that she did all the decorating for Hudson ’s offices and penthouse ? ”
85040	85044	85029	85029	I	884	“ I did . ”
85096	85122	85087	85087	I	884	“ Celia ’s got excellent taste . I think she managed to capture Hudson ’s style quite well in both his living and working space . ”
85142	85149	85154	85154	Jack	10551	“ Which is your favorite room ? ”
85150	85153	85154	85154	Jack	10551	“ Sophia . ”
85299	85315	85287	85287	Sophia	1858	“ Oh , I love all of it . I could never pick one room . ”
85332	85345	85316	85316	Hudson	1556	“ Did n’t you tell me you liked the library the best ? ”
85360	85367	85370	85370	I	884	“ Only because it has books . ”
85387	85396	85381	85381	Sophia	1858	“ He barely has any books at all . ”
85414	85424	85409	85409	He	0	“ Actually , we ’re working on improving that . ”
85438	85465	85409	85409	He	0	“ Alayna loves books so I ’ve purchased quite a few since we ’ve met . You have n’t been there in a while , Mother . ”
85466	85473	85485	85485	Jack	10551	“ I have n’t been invited . ”
85474	85482	85409	85409	He	0	“ Since when has that stopped you ? ”
85511	85519	85503	85503	Sophia	1858	“ Are you officially living together then ? ”
85520	85523	85524	85524	I	884	“ No , ”
85530	85533	85524	85524	I	884	“ Yes . ”
85572	85594	85566	85566	His	10551	“ But you practically are . Once your lease is up , next month . Or have you changed your mind ? ”
85665	85688	85659	85659	I	884	“ No , I have n’t changed my mind . I just did n’t realize we were telling your family , yet . ”
85689	85697	85698	85698	He	10551	“ Hell , I ’m telling everyone . ”
85708	85720	85704	85704	he	10551	“ It ’s the best thing to ever happen to me . ”
85730	85737	85721	85721	Jack	10551	“ I think it ’s terrific . ”
85746	85764	85738	85738	Sophia	1858	“ Why are you here anyway , Jack ? You have n’t vacationed with us in years . ”
85765	85770	85738	85738	Sophia	1858	“ Mira invited me . ”
85771	85790	85791	85791	Mira	8319	“ Hudson was coming and it ’s been so long since we ’ve had the whole family together . ”
85848	85861	85845	85845	Mira	8319	“ What ’s your family like , Laynie ? Are you close ? ”
85868	85898	85862	85862	I	884	“ Actually , no . My parents passed away in a drunk driving accident when I was sixteen . My brother looked after me , but now we ’re … ”
85921	85924	85862	85862	I	884	“ Estranged . ”
85925	85930	85931	85931	Mira	8319	“ Oh , no ! ”
85990	86002	85982	85982	Jack	10551	“ I hope that drunk was held accountable , at least . ”
86014	86017	86005	86005	he	1783	“ drunk . ”
86053	86075	86048	86048	I	884	“ You could say so . The drunk was my father . He was a full - time alcoholic , actually . ”
86076	86081	86082	86082	Jack	10551	“ I ’m sorry , ”
86086	86092	86082	86082	Jack	10551	“ I did n’t realize . ”
86097	86110	86093	86093	My	884	“ It was years ago . I ’ve learned to accept it . ”
86159	86165	86166	86166	Hudson	1556	“ Less than ideal pasts , ”
86192	86203	86166	86166	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s something Alayna and I have in common . ”
86248	86258	86259	86259	Sophia	1858	“ I do n’t like what you ’re implying , ”
86262	86278	86259	86259	Sophia	1858	“ I ’m not implying anything , Mother . I ’m stating an unattractive fact . ”
86279	86296	86300	86300	her	1858	“ Keep your unattractive facts to yourself for the rest of the day , will you ? ”
86316	86335	86305	86305	She	1858	“ Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I ’m going to prepare for our beach outing . ”
86548	86551	86552	86552	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ? ”
86559	86566	86552	86552	Hudson	1556	“ We could be a team . ”
86567	86571	86572	86572	I	884	“ You play ? ”
86617	86629	86605	86605	He	700	“ Do n’t act so surprised . I ’m very skilled . ”
86662	86667	86668	86668	Jack	10551	“ He rarely loses , ”
86688	86696	86677	86677	He	700	“ He takes after his old man . ”
86718	86721	86722	86722	Sophia	1858	“ Fantastic . ”
86734	86755	86722	86722	Sophia	1858	“ I ’m trying to relax and you all are going to be noisy and wild and disturb the peace . ”
86756	86764	86765	86765	Jack	10551	“ That ’s what beaches are for , ”
86780	86795	86765	86765	Jack	10551	“ You could go back to the house if you do n’t like it . ”
86803	86808	86796	86796	Sophia	1858	“ I ’m in . ”
86844	86850	86851	86851	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s your swimsuit ? ”
86856	86871	86851	86851	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re practically naked . It ’s going to distract the men playing . ”
86872	86881	86851	86851	Hudson	1556	“ Think of it as your secret weapon . ”
86882	86892	86893	86893	He	700	“ Except one of those men will be me . ”
86918	86924	86904	86904	I	884	“ Later , big boy . ”
86931	86941	86904	86904	I	884	“ Meanwhile , would you mind getting my back ? ”
86988	86995	86996	86996	he	700	“ I love touching your skin , ”
87166	87171	87172	87172	Adam	700	“ Net ’s ready , ”
87266	87274	87275	87275	Mira	8319	“ Dammit . I want to play , ”
87278	87286	87275	87275	Mira	8319	“ You know I ’d be MVP . ”
87287	87295	87296	87296	Adam	700	“ Yes , baby , you would . ”
87313	87329	87296	87296	Adam	700	“ But you play rough , and that would n’t be good for little jellybean . ”
87330	87341	87342	87342	Jack	10551	“ Yeah , you got ta protect my first grandchild , ”
87352	87365	87346	87346	Sophia	1858	“ But she is n’t technically having the first grandchild , Jack . ”
87377	87387	87366	87366	She	1858	“ Celia and Hudson ’s baby claims that title . ”
87444	87447	87448	87448	he	1804	“ Alayna , ”
87451	87454	87457	87457	Jack	10551	“ Sophia ! ”
87460	87471	87457	87457	Jack	10551	“ How dare you compare that to Mira ’s baby ? ”
87536	87542	87543	87543	Hudson	1556	“ Fuck you , Mother , ”
87650	87655	87656	87656	I	884	“ I ’m fine , ”
87663	87674	87656	87656	I	884	“ I ’m playing the part of a wounded girlfriend . ”
87688	87695	87675	87675	He	8319	“ Then why are you crying ? ”
87727	87733	87734	87734	My	884	“ I ’m just surprised . ”
87748	87759	87734	87734	My	884	“ I did n’t know you had slept with her . ”
87760	87765	87734	87734	My	884	“ I did n’t . ”
87766	87771	87734	87734	My	884	“ You obviously did . ”
87772	87787	87734	87734	My	884	“ No , my mother thinks I got Celia pregnant . I did not . ”
87800	87806	87788	87788	His	884	“ And why is that ? ”
87818	87833	87807	87807	He	884	“ Because when Celia got pregnant I told our parents I was the father . ”
87850	87857	87846	87846	he	884	“ Are you going to explain ? ”
87858	87861	87862	87862	He	884	“ No . ”
87867	87873	87862	87862	He	884	“ It ’s not relevant . ”
87926	87931	87932	87932	He	884	“ Alayna , stop . ”
87946	87949	87950	87950	He	884	“ Stop ! ”
87969	87977	87963	87963	He	884	“ I said , ‘ stop ! ’ ”
87978	87986	87987	87987	My	884	” Why ca n’t you tell me ? ”
87994	88002	87963	87963	He	884	“ Why ca n’t you trust me ? ”
88018	88037	88003	88003	I	884	“ That ’s funny — you asking me to trust you when you trust me with absolutely nothing . ”
88077	88087	88073	88073	His	884	“ You know more about me than most people . ”
88138	88141	88142	88142	I	884	“ No , ”
88151	88168	88142	88142	I	884	“ I know one thing about you that most people do n’t . It ’s different . ”
88169	88178	88142	88142	I	884	“ It ’s the only thing that matters . ”
88179	88182	88142	88142	I	884	“ Bullshit . ”
88222	88233	88219	88219	I	884	“ There ’s so much more to you than that . ”
88263	88270	88271	88271	he	884	“ Obviously you do know me , ”
88275	88286	88271	88271	he	884	“ if you feel comfortable making that kind of statement . ”
88433	88445	88414	88414	he	884	“ It ’s because you love her , is n’t it ? ”
88454	88467	88414	88414	he	884	“ That ’s why you told your parents it was your baby . ”
88468	88471	88414	88414	he	884	“ No ! ”
88482	88490	88472	88472	His	884	“ There ’s no other logical reason . ”
88537	88543	88521	88524	someone at that level	1817	“ Stop this , Alayna . ”
88576	88584	88562	88562	I	884	“ You ’re in love with her . ”
88592	88617	88585	88585	He	884	“ For the love of God ! If I am even capable of that emotion , Celia ’s not the one I ’d be … ”
88670	88702	88662	88662	he	884	“ I ’m not in love with Celia . I promised I ’d be honest with you , Alayna , but it does no good if you do n’t trust me . ”
88784	88792	88793	88793	His	884	“ I ’ve never slept with Celia . ”
88800	88819	88793	88793	His	884	“ I ’m not in love with her . I did n’t get her pregnant . Trust me . ”
88827	88830	88793	88793	His	884	“ Please . ”
88831	88834	88793	88793	His	884	“ Okay . ”
88841	88844	88835	88835	His	884	“ Okay ? ”
88845	88852	88793	88793	His	884	“ Okay , I trust you . ”
88853	88857	88835	88835	His	884	“ You do ? ”
88933	88937	88928	88928	I	884	“ I do . ”
88952	88956	88957	88957	He	1286	“ Thank you . ”
88962	88966	88957	88957	He	1286	“ Thank you . ”
89113	89121	89110	89110	he	1286	“ Look . My mother ’s leaving . ”
89168	89174	89154	89154	her	1858	“ We should get back . ”
89175	89179	89188	89188	his	1286	“ We should . ”
89195	89204	89205	89205	He	1286	“ We should kiss and make up first . ”
89215	89222	89205	89205	He	1286	“ In case anyone ’s watching . ”
89643	89648	89649	89649	he	700	“ Again , precious ? ”
89655	89658	89649	89649	he	700	“ Again . ”
89831	89837	89838	89838	I	884	“ Hold on , Hudson , ”
89843	89862	89838	89838	I	884	“ Dammit , Alayna , I have to be inside you . I ca n’t wait any longer . ”
89881	89885	89886	89886	I	884	“ Soon , H. ”
89893	89904	89886	89886	I	884	“ Lower the lights like you did the other night . ”
89947	89955	89956	89956	I	884	“ Get settled in bed . Naked . ”
89959	89967	89968	89968	he	10551	“ Oh , you ’re taking charge , ”
89980	89984	89968	89968	he	10551	“ How adorable . ”
89985	89991	89992	89992	I	884	“ Do n’t patronize me . ”
90043	90052	90053	90053	He	10551	“ I ’m not . I ’m excited . ”
90062	90068	90053	90053	He	10551	“ I ’m already hard . ”
90077	90087	90088	90088	I	884	“ Good . Now do as you were told . ”
90098	90105	90088	90088	I	884	“ And do n’t fall asleep ! ”
90106	90116	90053	90053	He	10551	“ Then do n’t take forever in the bathroom . ”
90264	90275	90276	90276	He	10551	“ Jesus , Alayna . You ’re so goddamn beautiful . ”
90283	90297	90276	90276	He	10551	“ I might have to let you wear that while I fuck you . ”
90312	90316	90317	90317	he	10551	“ Come here , ”
90327	90337	90320	90320	I	884	“ Wait , I ’m in control , remember ? ”
90349	90354	90338	90338	He	10551	“ Then take charge . ”
90423	90430	90431	90431	My	884	“ Sit back against the headboard . ”
90574	90579	90565	90565	Hudson	1556	“ Do it again . ”
90604	90609	90595	90595	I	884	“ Maybe I will . ”
90681	90692	90675	90675	He	10551	“ Oh , precious , you suck me so good . ”
90811	90816	90817	90817	I	884	“ You want more ? ”
90820	90827	90817	90817	I	884	“ You ’ll have to wait . ”
90915	90921	90922	90922	he	10551	“ What do you want ? ”
91036	91041	91042	91042	I	884	“ Touch my breasts , ”
91141	91148	91124	91124	He	10551	“ Hudson , oh , god . ”
91183	91192	91193	91193	He	10551	“ You ’re already so wet , precious . ”
91203	91215	91193	91193	He	10551	“ Shall I put my fingers inside you ? Tell me . ”
91249	91257	91258	91258	I	884	“ I want your cock inside me . ”
91304	91315	91301	91301	he	10551	“ But you are n’t ready for me , precious . ”
91316	91322	91323	91323	I	884	“ I ’m ready enough . ”
91330	91337	91323	91323	I	884	“ I want to ride you . ”
91436	91446	91447	91447	Hudson	1556	“ I ca n’t imagine why I deserve this , ”
91458	91472	91447	91447	Hudson	1556	“ I should be rewarding you for your very believable girlfriend act today . ”
91683	91686	91687	91687	he	10551	“ Fuck , ”
91690	91701	91687	91687	he	10551	“ You ’re so tight , Alayna . So good . ”
91787	91794	91795	91795	I	884	“ God , oh , god , ”
91863	91876	91877	91877	I	884	“ I ’m happy , Hudson . You ’ve made me happy . ”
91927	91936	91910	91910	They	1847	“ And I ’ve made you happy too . ”
91969	91984	91960	91960	I	884	“ We ’re falling in love . This is us , falling in love . ”
91985	91988	91993	91993	he	10551	“ Enough . ”
92425	92429	92415	92415	Mira	8319	“ Good mor — “
92430	92435	92436	92436	I	884	“ Where ’s Hudson ? ”
92457	92463	92448	92448	Sophia	1858	“ He left with Celia . ”
92487	92509	92472	92472	Mira	8319	“ He had a business thing come up . Some sort of emergency . He had to fly immediately to Cincinnati . ”
92510	92515	92472	92472	Mira	8319	“ Celia drove him . ”
92516	92524	92525	92525	I	884	“ Mother , honestly ! Stop it ! ”
92549	92594	92525	92525	I	884	“ Celia was already here to show us the designs when Hudson discovered he needed to leave . She offered to drive him to the airport so that he could leave the car for you to get back to the city whenever you wanted . ”
92734	92741	92726	92726	He	1852	“ But I do n’t drive . ”
92745	92760	92742	92742	Mira	8319	“ Hudson said you might not want to . Martin can drive you then . ”
92761	92772	92742	92742	Mira	8319	“ I ’m not giving up my hired help to — “
92790	92802	92773	92773	Mira	8319	“ Then I ’ll take her ! Or Adam or Chandler . ”
92803	92809	92773	92773	Mira	8319	“ I ’ll drive you . ”
92833	92844	92830	92830	my	884	“ Thank you . Give me ten minutes to pack . ”
92943	92954	92935	92935	Mira	8319	“ Laynie , you do n’t have to leave yet . ”
92967	92987	92935	92935	Mira	8319	“ Stay until tomorrow . We can go do something girly , get mani - pedis if you want . ”
93059	93076	93043	93044	no one	650	“ Thank you , Mira , sincerely . But I ca n’t stay here without Hudson . ”
93077	93081	93043	93044	no one	650	“ I understand . ”
93130	93139	93122	93122	I	884	“ Did he say ... anything about me ? ”
93153	93161	93122	93122	I	884	“ Or leave any message for me ? ”
93169	93187	93162	93162	She	8319	“ I think he was going to call you or something . Have you checked your phone ? ”
93236	93241	93242	93242	I	884	“ It ’s dead , ”
93245	93253	93242	93242	I	884	“ I forgot to bring a charger . ”
93254	93268	93242	93242	I	884	“ Is it a standard USB ? You can take my car charger . ”
93275	93281	93269	93269	I	884	“ Thank you , Mira . ”
93282	93286	93287	93287	She	8319	“ No problem . ”
93299	93305	93287	93287	She	8319	“ Martin can get that . ”
93306	93311	93312	93312	I	884	“ I got it . ”
93344	93347	93348	93348	Mira	8319	“ Laynie . ”
93397	93404	93405	93405	she	8319	“ I know he loves you , ”
93409	93458	93405	93405	she	8319	“ I know he does . But he ’s been through ... things ... that ’s made it hard for him to open up , so please do n’t take that as , well , as evidence of anything if he ca n’t tell you how he feels . ”
93484	93488	93480	93480	I	884	“ I know . ”
93489	93492	93465	93465	Mira	8319	“ Good . ”
93493	93496	93497	93497	I	884	“ But … ”
93509	93534	93497	93497	I	884	“ Why do you believe that ? I mean , what makes you think that he loves me , or that he even can ? ”
93619	93644	93605	93605	Mira	8319	“ I do n’t know , Laynie . He ’s different around you . I ’ve never seen him like he is with you . ”
93645	93655	93605	93605	Mira	8319	“ Maybe you see what you want to believe . ”
93656	93659	93660	93660	She	8319	“ Maybe . ”
93666	93683	93660	93660	She	8319	“ But I ’m not giving up on him . I hope you do n’t either . ”
93684	93689	93691	93691	Hudson	1556	“ I wo n’t . ”
93787	93798	93805	93805	her	1858	“ You should n’t be surprised that he left you . ”
93856	93867	93868	93868	She	1858	“ I told , you he does n’t feel anything . ”
93899	93903	93904	93904	she	1858	“ For anyone , ”
93907	93913	93914	93914	I	884	“ That ’s a lie . ”
93944	93953	93935	93935	I	884	“ I ’ve seen proof to the contrary . ”
93954	93970	93921	93921	She	1858	“ Because of how he seems to love you ? He ’s a good actor . ”
93977	93989	93971	93971	I	884	“ No , because of how he seems to love you . ”
93997	94068	94069	94069	You	1885	“ When there ’s no reason he should . When you ’ve alienated him and betrayed him and destroyed him and made him the confused man he is by your lack of affection and support and faith . If he can continue to care about a piece of shit like you , after all you ’ve done to him , then I have no doubt of his capability of love . ”
94202	94215	94183	94183	I	884	“ Plexis crisis . I ’ll call as soon as I can . ”
94442	94456	94434	94434	my	884	“ Why did you go ? Are you really on a business trip ? ”
94457	94471	94434	94434	my	884	“ I ca n’t do the on - duty anymore . I quit . ”
94472	94481	94434	94434	my	884	“ Why wo n’t you let me in ? ”
94482	94487	94434	94434	my	884	“ I love you . ”
94613	94633	94604	94604	Jack	10551	“ If you wait here , I can find a spot somewhere and help you up to your apartment . ”
94664	94674	94654	94654	I	884	“ I can get it . Thanks , though . ”
94696	94711	94683	94683	I	884	“ And thank you for driving me here and for … well , for … ”
94721	94727	94683	94683	I	884	“ For being so kind . ”
94739	94754	94736	94736	He	10551	“ I ’m not really that kind . I just appear so in comparison . ”
94769	94772	94773	94773	I	884	“ Jack . ”
94791	94800	94786	94786	I	884	“ Why are you still married to her ? ”
94801	94827	94828	94828	He	10551	“ I wish I could say it ’s because I remember the sweet woman she once was , but she was never a sweet woman . ”
94854	94938	94847	94847	they	1902	“ Sophia came to the marriage with a couple of businesses given to us by her father . I took control when her father retired and have spent my life making them successful . Now Hudson runs them . If I divorced Sophia , the controlling interest would go to her . As long as we ’re married , she does n’t care what we do with them . And she ’d never ask for a divorce — it would be too embarrassing . ”
94946	95018	94939	94939	He	1904	“ I wonder sometimes — if I ’d let go of the businesses , divorced her when the kids were still young , could I have changed how they are now ? But she would have gotten joint custody at the very least . And she may have messed them up even more , retaliating against me . It ’s not an ideal situation , but it is what it is . ”
95258	95267	95245	95245	I	884	“ I ’ll be here when you return . ”
95278	95280	95276	95276	I	884	“ SEND ”
95422	95428	95465	95465	He	1286	“ Open up , Laynie . ”
95446	95462	95465	95465	He	1286	“ I know you ’re in there . The doorman told me you came up . ”
95528	95542	95510	95510	He	1286	“ What are you doing here , Brian ? Are you stalking me ? ”
95557	95567	95510	95510	He	1286	“ You have n’t returned any of my calls . ”
95654	95661	95662	95662	Innocent	268	“ Oh , did you call ? ”
95681	95695	95673	95673	I	884	“ My phone ’s been dead and I ’ve been out of town . ”
95696	95709	95712	95712	he	1286	“ Yeah , I got that from your boss at the club . ”
95736	95746	95722	95722	Brian	1286	“ You were with him , were n’t you ? ”
95747	95752	95756	95756	he	1286	“ Him , who ? ”
95801	95815	95789	95789	Brian	1286	“ Dammit , Laynie , do n’t play games . This is serious . ”
95828	95838	95816	95816	He	1286	“ Hudson Pierce . Were you with Hudson Pierce ? ”
95839	95842	95843	95843	I	884	“ Yes . ”
95851	95882	95843	95843	I	884	“ And Jonathon Pierce , for that matter . And Sophia Pierce and Mirabelle Pierce and Chandler Pierce . At their Hampton house . Brian , what is your problem ? ”
95893	95920	95883	95883	His	1286	“ What is my problem ? You are my problem . Always . Alayna , I saw you in the society pages — you’re dating him ? ”
95932	95955	95883	95883	His	1286	“ You ca n’t date Hudson fucking Pierce . Do you know who he is ? Do you know what he is ? ”
96016	96068	96013	96013	Brian	1286	“ He ’s a goddamn giant , is what he is , Alayna . If you fuck with him — when you fuck with him — I wo n’t be able to get you out of it . The Pierces are so big , they ’ll squash you like a bug . ”
96069	96078	96079	96079	I	884	“ Wait a minute , wait a minute . ”
96088	96103	96079	96079	I	884	“ You ’re not concerned for me , you ’re worried about … Hudson ? ”
96104	96113	96114	96114	He	1286	“ Why should I be concerned for you ? ”
96122	96136	96114	96114	He	1286	“ You ’re the one with the history of going mental over guys . ”
96137	96141	96142	96142	I	884	“ Get out . ”
96149	96162	96163	96163	He	1286	“ Harassment , drive - bys , breaking and entering , stalking — ”
96175	96179	96180	96180	I	884	“ Get out , ”
96221	96230	96253	96253	He	1286	“ Were you even invited to the Hamptons ? ”
96231	96237	96238	96238	I	884	“ Get the fuck out ! ”
96241	96252	96238	96238	I	884	“ Get out ! Get out ! Get . Out ! ”
96258	96269	96253	96253	He	1286	“ My name ’s on the lease , not yours . ”
96270	96284	96285	96285	I	884	“ Then I ’ll get the lease changed . Or I ’ll move . ”
96296	96355	96285	96285	I	884	“ But now I ’m telling you , so help me god , if you do n’t leave I ’ll call the cops and , even if it gets me nowhere , it will at least occupy your life with yet another embarrassing sister incident . So I ’m telling you , get the fuck out , now . ”
96356	96363	96364	96364	He	1286	“ I ’m done , Alayna . ”
96380	96384	96285	96285	I	884	“ Get out ! ”
96393	96419	96420	96420	He	1286	“ I ’m leaving , but I ’m telling you , I ’m done . Do not even think about coming crawling back to me . ”
96431	96441	96420	96420	He	1286	“ You ’re on your own with this mess . ”
96538	96548	96521	96521	David	180	“ Should we move it to the other wall ? ”
96751	96761	96787	96787	I	884	“ It ’s fine , David . Leave it . ”
96762	96778	96787	96787	I	884	“ Are you sure ? This is your vision , Laynie . Make it work . ”
96779	96786	96787	96787	I	884	“ It works perfectly as is . ”
96814	96826	96805	96805	He	1286	“ It ’s pretty comfy , too . Check it out . ”
96841	96844	96845	96845	I	884	“ Hmm , ”
96853	96857	96845	96845	I	884	“ Not bad . ”
97032	97046	97056	97056	Boy	192	“ So what ’s going on in your pretty little head , Laynie ? ”
97063	97066	97067	97067	I	884	“ Stuff , ”
97098	97106	97087	97087	He	1925	“ Pierce okay with that Plexis deal ? ”
97114	97120	97107	97107	I	884	“ What do you mean ? ”
97126	97140	97141	97141	He	1925	“ I figured you knew . It was in the paper this morning . ”
97277	97282	97267	97267	David	180	“ Here it is . ”
97469	97479	97451	97451	I	884	“ You like him more than you let on . ”
97480	97488	97489	97489	I	884	“ I do . I love him . ”
97511	97525	97497	97497	David	180	“ I did n’t mean to fall in love . I just did . ”
97534	97542	97526	97526	David	180	“ That ’s how it usually occurs . ”
97583	97589	97576	97576	David	180	“ And he feels … ? ”
97618	97624	97609	97609	he	180	“ I ’m not sure . ”
97625	97632	97633	97633	David	180	“ That ’s a real bummer . ”
97661	97678	97650	97650	his	180	“ For what it ’s worth , I ’ll tell you how I feel : Stupid . ”
97679	97682	97683	97683	I	884	“ Stupid ? ”
97706	97709	97710	97710	He	180	“ Yeah . ”
97715	97726	97710	97710	He	180	“ How did I let you slip through my fingers ? ”
97727	97730	97731	97731	I	884	“ David … ”
97905	97913	97902	97902	he	180	“ I just thought you should know . ”
97914	97918	97919	97919	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
97957	97962	97946	97946	He	180	“ Back to work . ”
97985	97997	97976	97976	David	180	“ But if you ever find yourself on the market again … ”
98063	98074	98058	98058	I	884	“ I ’ll keep you in mind . For sure . ”
98075	98082	98058	98058	I	884	“ Can we hug it out ? ”
98198	98203	98204	98204	David	180	“ Hey , Pierce , ”
98362	98375	98381	98381	my	884	“ I ’ll , uh , let you guys have some privacy . ”
98499	98502	98503	98503	I	884	“ Hudson , ”
98519	98525	98514	98514	I	884	“ I read about Plexis . ”
98538	98544	98526	98526	I	884	“ I ’m so sor — “
98550	98560	98545	98545	He	180	“ What ’s going on with you and him ? ”
98574	98577	98578	98578	I	884	“ Nothing , ”
98585	98592	98578	98578	I	884	“ David was , um , … ”
98621	98632	98610	98610	I	884	“ It was a friendly hug , that ’s all . ”
98638	98650	98651	98651	He	180	“ The expression on his face was much more than friendly . ”
98659	98665	98651	98651	He	180	“ Have you fucked him ? ”
98666	98669	98610	98610	I	884	“ No ! ”
98677	98681	98670	98670	His	180	“ But almost . ”
98682	98685	98651	98651	He	180	“ No . ”
98737	98745	98805	98805	He	180	“ Why do n’t I believe you ? ”
98746	98755	98756	98756	I	884	“ Because you have some serious trust issues . ”
98795	98804	98789	98789	Hudson	1556	“ What is your fucking deal , anyway ? ”
98811	98817	98818	98818	he	180	“ I told you before , ”
98821	98827	98818	98818	he	180	“ I do n’t share . ”
98907	98917	98944	98944	I	884	“ But I have to share you with Celia ? ”
98918	98943	98944	98944	I	884	“ Goddammit , Alayna . How many times do I have to say it ? There is nothing going on with me and Celia . ”
99054	99066	99047	99047	he	180	“ And there ’s nothing going on with me and David . ”
99067	99070	99071	99071	His	180	“ Really ? ”
99076	99089	99071	99071	His	180	“ That ’s not how it looked when I walked in here . ”
99096	99119	99090	99090	My	884	“ Just like that ’s not how it looked when you left with Celia while I was still naked in your bed ? ”
99146	99164	99165	99165	he	180	“ Leaving you that morning was the hardest fucking thing I ’ve done in a long time , ”
99168	99175	99165	99165	he	180	“ Do n’t treat it lightly . ”
99276	99281	99269	99269	I	884	“ Hudson , stop . ”
99329	99332	99333	99333	I	884	“ Stop ! ”
99346	99349	99350	99350	he	180	“ No , ”
99356	99365	99350	99350	he	180	“ I have to fuck you . Now . ”
99366	99375	99376	99376	I	884	“ Why ? Are you marking your territory ? ”
99419	99447	99405	99405	I	884	“ You do n’t own me , Hudson ! Stop messing with me like I ’m one of your other women . Not with me , remember ? ”
99448	99481	99482	99482	His	180	“ Do n’t you think I know that ? Every minute of every day I remind myself that I ca n’t conquer you . That I ca n’t do that to you . ”
99486	99499	99482	99482	His	180	“ But it does n’t mean that I do n’t want to . ”
99550	99559	99597	99597	I	884	“ So I am just like the others . ”
99560	99567	99568	99568	His	180	“ No . You ’re not . ”
99572	99593	99568	99568	His	180	“ I told you before . I do n’t want to hurt you more than I need to win you . ”
99601	99608	99597	99597	I	884	“ You ’ve already done both . ”
99609	99612	99613	99613	His	180	“ Fuck ! ”
99767	99770	99771	99771	he	180	“ Alayna , ”
99836	99839	99840	99840	I	884	“ Hudson , ”
99869	99876	99840	99840	I	884	“ I need you , too . ”
99968	99981	99946	99946	Hudson	1556	“ Oh , yay ; we ’re going to christen the couch ! ”
100314	100317	100318	100318	He	180	“ Hudson ! ”
100401	100417	100398	100398	he	180	“ I wanted to win you . But I did n’t want to hurt you . ”
100424	100433	100398	100398	he	180	“ That ’s the last thing I wanted . ”
100506	100518	100500	100500	I	884	“ That ’s part of relationships , H. People get hurt . ”
100524	100534	100500	100500	I	884	“ But you can make it better , too . ”
100544	100549	100535	100535	He	180	“ Tell me how . ”
100571	100576	100577	100577	I	884	“ Let me in , ”
100580	100589	100604	100604	He	180	“ Do n’t you see I already have ? ”
100783	100793	100776	100776	His	180	“ Why do you act like I ’m running ? ”
100794	100809	100776	100776	His	180	“ Because you shut me out . Is n’t that the same as running ? ”
100810	100833	100776	100776	His	180	“ What about you ? What about how you showed up in our bedroom crying and could n’t even tell me why ? ”
100834	100839	100776	100776	His	180	“ That was different . ”
100875	100885	100866	100866	He	180	“ What did she say to you , Alayna ? ”
100908	100920	100901	100901	I	884	“ That I was insignificant . She called me a whore . ”
100945	100953	100939	100939	He	180	“ My mother ’s heartless and cruel . ”
100968	100997	100961	100961	he	180	“ You ’re not a whore , Alayna . Not even close . And the magnitude of your importance in my life ca n’t be put into words . ”
100998	101010	101011	101011	He	180	“ She also said that you ca n’t ever love me . ”
101022	101030	101015	101015	his	180	“ I ’ve told you that before . ”
101050	101058	101043	101043	I	884	“ Well , she told me again . ”
101065	101077	101059	101059	I	884	“ So there , I opened up . Are you happy ? ”
101078	101081	101043	101043	I	884	“ Alayna … ”
101133	101165	101166	101166	I	884	“ How could you not think I ’d fall in love with you , Hudson ? Even if you did n’t mean for it to happen , how could I not ? ”
101179	101189	101166	101166	I	884	“ Does that mean anything to you at all ? ”
101200	101232	101190	101190	He	180	“ How can you ask that ? Of course , it does . But , Alayna , you do n’t know that you ’d still say that if you knew me . ”
101233	101239	101190	101190	He	180	“ I do know you . ”
101240	101244	101190	101190	He	180	“ Not everything . ”
101245	101255	101256	101256	We	1963	“ Only because you have n’t let me in ! ”
101274	101371	101265	101265	He	180	“ What is it you want to know ? About what I did to other women ? About Celia ? I ’m the reason she got pregnant , Alayna . Because I spent an entire summer making her fall in love with me when I felt nothing for her . For fun . For something to do . And then , when I ’d completely broken her , she became destructive — sleeping around , partying , drugs . You name it , she did it . She did n’t even know who the father was . ”
101385	101393	101372	101372	I	884	“ So you claimed it was yours . ”
101394	101397	101265	101265	He	180	“ Yes . ”
101398	101404	101372	101372	I	884	“ Because you felt responsible . ”
101405	101432	101265	101265	He	180	“ Yes . She lost the baby at three months . Likely from the drinking and drugs she ’d consumed early on . She was devastated . ”
101433	101438	101439	101439	I	884	“ That ’s awful . ”
101498	101503	101504	101504	I	884	“ It ’s awful , ”
101507	101526	101504	101504	I	884	“ but I do n’t understand . You thought this would make me not love you … why ? ”
101543	101569	101527	101527	He	1964	“ Because it changes everything . I did that . That ’s who I am . It ’s my past and it ’s very ugly . ”
101672	101684	101658	101658	I	884	“ Do you think your ugly is any different than mine ? ”
101685	101701	101658	101658	I	884	“ This is n’t like following someone around or calling too many times , Alayna . ”
101702	101784	101658	101658	I	884	“ It was an unforeseen tragedy , Hudson . A game that got out of hand . You did n’t set out for Celia to get pregnant and have a miscarriage . And you ca n’t diminish the things I ’ve done to a simple statement like that either . I hurt people . Deeply . But that was before . Less than ideal pasts , remember ? It does n’t mean it defines our future . Or even our now . ”
101806	101818	101785	101785	He	1964	“ When I ’m with you , I almost believe that . ”
101819	101832	101785	101785	He	1964	“ That just means you need to spend more time with me . ”
101837	101844	101833	101833	He	1964	“ Is that what that means ? ”
101857	101903	101833	101833	He	1964	“ Yesterday morning , when I got the phone call that required me to be in Cincinatti — I could n’t even let myself look at you , sleeping in that bed . If I did , I would n’t have been able to leave . ”
101911	101922	101923	101923	His	1964	“ I thought you left because you were freaking out . ”
101931	101938	101923	101923	His	1964	“ Because of the love stuff . ”
101939	101954	101904	101904	My	884	“ I was n’t freaking out . I was surprised , that ’s all . ”

102044	102065	102033	102033	His	1964	“ But , Alayna , I ’ve never had a healthy romantic relationship . Every woman who ’s loved me … ”

102142	102165	102132	102132	I	884	“ Follow through … with whatever this is that we have , it will hurt . But I wo n’t be broken . ”
102166	102172	102033	102033	His	1964	“ But it would hurt ? ”
102173	102178	102132	102132	I	884	“ Like a motherfucker . ”
102179	102186	102187	102187	He	884	“ Then we better follow through . ”

104623	104633	104608	104608	I	884	“ But Celia decorated this place too , right ? ”

105104	105116	105092	105092	I	884	“ What ’s over there ? Is that the dining room ? ”
105117	105128	105129	105129	He	0	“ I ’ll give you a tour in the morning . ”
105147	105154	105155	105155	I	884	“ A tour in the morning , ”

106161	106171	106172	106172	His	2027	“ Because when I go to bed with you — ”

But when you hit your stride , you were magnificent . Yet you had no idea . It was completely obvious that it never crossed your mind that the room was full of people who would have hired you had you spoken to any of them . Thank god , you did n’t . Because I watched them watch you and I knew . I knew that they saw you were smart . They saw you had business savvy . But none of them recognized the rare jewel that stood before them . Precious . ”
107340	107347	107337	107338	No one	650	“ I love you , Hudson . ”

107844	107853	107838	107839	my girl	1094	“ Last night . Before you got here . ”

108061	108064	108058	108058	I	884	“ Sorry . ”
108096	108114	108086	108086	I	884	“ Um , I need to get up . Is that going to be too … distracting ? ”
108134	108137	108115	108115	He	650	“ Here . ”
108156	108165	108166	108166	he	650	“ You ’re a wicked , wicked woman , ”
108178	108184	108166	108166	he	650	“ And you love it . ”
108197	108224	108190	108190	he	650	“ The bathroom ’s there . There should be brand new toothbrushes in one of the drawers . Look around until you find what you need . ”
108225	108229	108230	108230	I	884	“ Thank you . ”

109033	109037	108988	108988	He	2069	“ What stuff ? ”
109038	109042	109043	109043	I	884	“ This stuff . ”
109066	109089	109043	109043	I	884	“ And you have a plethora of toothbrushes and this woman ’s robe . Why do you have a woman ’s robe ? ”
109104	109128	109094	109094	he	2069	“ I have more than the robe . I have several pieces of women ’s clothing in the extra closet in my bedroom . ”
109129	109135	109140	109140	I	884	“ That ’s not helping . ”
109156	109168	109140	109140	I	884	“ You told me you never had a woman here before . ”
109169	109178	109094	109094	he	2069	“ Do I detect a hint of jealousy ? ”
109187	109243	109244	109244	My	884	“ You detect more than a fucking hint . Also , a whole lot of suspicion . Come on , H , this is n’t any way to start a relationship . If you ’ve had a woman here — if this is someone else ’s clothing I ’m wearing — I need to know . ”
109314	109321	109328	109328	I	884	“ They ’re yours , Alayna . ”
109322	109325	109328	109328	I	884	“ What ? ”
109333	109365	109328	109328	I	884	“ I purchased them for you . Except the toothbrushes . My housekeeper buys me those so I have plenty for when I travel . The clothing and cosmetics are yours . ”
109378	109385	109375	109375	I	884	“ When did you get them ? ”
109432	109441	109413	109414	his mother	876	“ Last night after I left the club . ”
109445	109452	109453	109453	He	2069	“ But that was almost eight . ”
109476	109480	109453	109453	He	2069	“ How did — ”
109481	109489	109490	109490	he	2069	“ I understand what it looks like , ”
109495	109508	109509	109509	He	2069	“ There ’s likely still a tag on the robe if you … ”
109519	109524	109525	109525	He	2069	“ Yes , see ? ”
109582	109588	109578	109578	I	884	“ Why ? How ... ? ”
109589	109651	109677	109677	he	2077	“ Why ? Because I knew you ’d have nothing to wear today and I did n’t want you to have to do the so - called walk of shame through my lobby . Plus I figured you ’d want to wash that club makeup off your face and freshen up a bit . As for how … I have people . ”
109660	109665	109652	109652	I	884	“ You have people . ”
109730	109733	109734	109734	I	884	“ Mirabelle ? ”
109761	109764	109765	109765	He	2077	“ Yes . ”
109770	109774	109765	109765	He	2077	“ And others . ”
109829	109832	109839	109839	me	884	“ Oh . ”
109969	109978	109979	109979	I	884	“ It must be nice to have people , ”
109982	109987	109979	109979	I	884	“ I want people . ”

110289	110300	110301	110301	His	2089	“ I could stare at your pussy all day long . ”
110312	110321	110322	110322	My	884	“ Do n’t you have to be somewhere ? ”
110370	110385	110386	110386	His	2089	“ I do have someplace to be . We ’ll have to be quick . ”
110397	110410	110386	110386	His	2089	“ But I ’m not leaving here without fucking you good morning . ”
110466	110481	110463	110463	my	884	“ Your housekeeper is n’t going to walk in on us , is she ? ”
110482	110500	110501	110501	He	2089	“ She comes on Tuesday and Friday . If I ’m not mistaken , it ’s Wednesday . ”
110511	110523	110501	110501	He	2089	“ And if she did walk in , would you care ? ”
110528	110531	110532	110532	I	884	“ No , ”
110655	110661	110631	110631	He	1097	“ Touch yourself , precious . ”
110672	110678	110631	110631	He	1097	“ Let ’s come together . ”
110783	110790	110791	110791	His	1097	“ That ’s it , Alayna . ”
110795	110803	110804	110804	His	1097	“ Fuck , that ’s … it … ”
110838	110843	110831	110831	He	1097	“ How was that ? ”
110861	110872	110858	110858	I	884	“ You can fuck me good morning anytime you want . ”
110873	110885	110886	110886	He	1097	“ I would n’t mind fucking you good morning every morning . ”
111015	111023	111026	111026	he	1097	“ I ’m jumping in the shower . ”
111034	111043	111026	111026	he	1097	“ If that ’s okay , I mean . ”
111110	111130	111096	111096	he	1097	“ It ’s more than okay . I want you to stay . I planned that you would stay . ”
111167	111189	111153	111153	he	1097	“ My driver ’s here . Seems I used up the time I meant to spend giving you the penthouse tour . ”
111193	111196	111190	111190	I	884	“ Whoops . ”
111197	111207	111208	111208	He	1097	“ You ’ll have to explore on your own . ”
111219	111244	111190	111190	I	884	“ Are you giving me permission to snoop ? Because it sounds like you are and you do n’t understand — I’m a snooper . ”
111248	111292	111245	111245	He	1097	“ I do n’t doubt it . I have nothing to hide . Snoop away . Use the gym . Take a nap . There ’s food in the fridge . Do and take whatever you like . You work at eight tonight ? ”
111293	111296	111297	111297	I	884	“ Yes . ”
111354	111367	111370	111370	He	1097	“ Good . I ’ll make sure I ’m home by six . ”
111391	111401	111388	111388	my	884	“ We ’ll have dinner together before you leave . ”
111402	111413	111436	111436	I	884	“ I hope you are n’t expecting me to cook . ”
111420	111435	111388	111388	my	884	“ Do n’t be silly . I ’ll arrange for the cook to come . ”
111452	111472	111473	111473	He	1097	“ Oh , and the books for the library should be here today . There ’s an intercom there . ”
111483	111518	111473	111473	He	1097	“ And one in the hallway by the elevators and a third one in the bedroom . When security buzzes up , you can approve the delivery and the guard will let them up . ”
111519	111523	111525	111525	me	884	“ Sure thing . ”
111539	111544	111525	111525	me	884	“ Wait , books ? ”
111545	111566	111473	111473	He	1097	“ Yes , I ordered a few books . Since you said it was your favorite part of the library . ”
111567	111570	111525	111525	me	884	“ Right . ”
111669	111695	111653	111653	Hudson	1556	“ I still feel somehow tricked about that whole thing , by the way . But when did you have a chance to order them ? ”
111761	111777	111778	111778	His	2106	“ I ordered them Monday night from my hotel . After the deal with Plexis . ”
111804	111809	111795	111795	His	2106	“ What is it ? ”
111826	111856	111857	111857	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s silly , but I ’d convinced myself you had n’t called me or anything because you did n’t have time . But it seems you did . ”
111912	111921	111905	111905	he	2106	“ Like I said , it ’s silly . ”
111929	111961	111922	111922	Hudson	1556	“ I was trying to not be with you at the time , Alayna . But I could n’t sleep that night . Because I could n’t stop thinking about you . ”
111974	111985	111962	111962	He	2106	“ Tell me — what ’s going on in there ? ”
111986	111991	111994	111994	I	884	“ It ’s just … ”
112037	112075	112031	112031	I	884	“ You ’ve made a complete one - eighty , Hudson . About you and me . You were so intent to be only sex only half a day ago . And now … who are you ? ”
112116	112126	112100	112100	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t do that . I mean it . ”
112142	112181	112127	112127	He	2106	“ I ’m the same man , Alayna . A man who commits to whichever plan he ’s chosen . I had told myself I could n’t have you . So I did n’t let myself even try . ”
112182	112190	112191	112191	I	884	“ And now you ’ve let yourself . ”
112213	112241	112242	112242	He	2106	“ Yes . And I will commit to this new plan as fiercely as the other . Even more fiercely . Because that plan was a compromise . ”
112249	112269	112242	112242	He	2106	“ This plan is the one I should have pursued to begin with . It ’s the better plan . ”
112274	112284	112270	112270	My	884	“ The plan with the greater potential of profit . ”
112285	112289	112290	112290	He	2106	“ Unfathomable potential . ”
112324	112337	112304	112304	he	2106	“ I have to go . Save more of that for later . ”
112338	112341	112304	112304	he	2106	“ Always . ”
113431	113434	113417	113417	I	884	“ Laynie ? ”
113470	113477	113461	113461	she	2138	“ Alayna , is that you ? ”
113498	113501	113457	113457	Her	2138	“ Hi . ”
113502	113505	113506	113506	Her	2138	“ Wow . ”
113526	113536	113506	113506	Her	2138	“ I did n’t expect you to be here . ”
113588	113606	113577	113577	I	884	“ I did n’t expect you either . Hudson did n’t say you were delivering the books . ”
113612	113650	113607	113607	Celia	9246	“ He did n’t know . He ordered them through my office and my schedule was open today , so I thought I ’d make sure they got here okay and help unpack them if need be . ”
113651	113657	113607	113607	Celia	9246	“ You have a key . ”
113700	113729	113691	113691	She	9246	“ I do . Since I did the interior decorating . We ’re always updating , and we thought it was easiest for me to keep a key . ”
113760	113775	113749	113749	she	9246	“ I did buzz though before I came up and there was no answer . ”
113776	113783	113796	113796	she	9246	“ I was in the shower . ”
113784	113789	113790	113790	She	9246	“ I see that . ”
113908	113942	113899	113899	Celia	9246	“ Look , let me get finished with the delivery guys and you can get dressed . Then we can chat or whatever . It seems we have some catching up to do . ”
114402	114414	114398	114398	I	884	“ Damn . He went all out , did n’t he ? ”
114422	114444	114415	114415	Celia	9246	“ He always does . But as I ’m sure you ’ve noticed , he has lots of shelves to fill . ”
114545	114564	114625	114625	she	9246	“ Uh , yeah . These boxes are barely going to put a dent in that shelf space . ”
114565	114614	114625	114625	she	9246	“ He ordered more , but this is what was already in stock . The rest should come in the next few days or so . And , yes , he ’ll still have a lot of empty space . Maybe you can help him fill the rest . ”
114660	114663	114651	114651	I	884	“ Maybe . ”
114746	114753	114738	114738	her	9246	“ So . You and Hudson . ”
114754	114761	114762	114762	Celia	9246	“ Yeah . Crazy , right ? ”
114777	114788	114738	114738	her	9246	“ It ’s real then ? You ’re really together ? ”
114789	114804	114762	114762	Celia	9246	“ We are . No more pretending . It ’s the real deal now . ”
114837	114841	114829	114829	I	884	“ Since when ? ”
114856	114912	114913	114913	Celia	9246	“ I was with him Monday and he did n’t say anything had changed between you , though he did seem awfully lovesick . I thought he was being moody about his business - whatever that was going on . But now that I see you here , I ’m thinking it was about you . ”
114935	114956	114957	114957	I	884	“ Just since yesterday . When he came back from Cincinnati , we sort of had it out and then — ”
115006	115016	114996	114996	she	9246	“ Is this weird for me to talk about ? ”
115017	115022	115023	115023	Her	9246	“ Weird ? Why ? ”
115029	115036	115023	115023	Her	9246	“ Oh , he told you . ”
115037	115041	115042	115042	I	884	“ He did . ”
115060	115070	115042	115042	I	884	“ I ’m sorry if that makes you uncomfortable . ”
115071	115101	115102	115102	She	9246	“ No , not at all . It surprises me . He ’s never talked about it with anyone . I ’m not even sure he told his therapist . ”
115112	115125	115102	115102	She	9246	“ What exactly did he say ? Do you mind me asking ? ”
115126	115146	115102	115102	She	9246	“ Of course not , it ’s only fair I tell you . But can we sit down first ? ”
115182	115232	115233	115233	Celia	9246	“ Well . He , um , explained about how he , uh , made you fall for him and then slept with your best friend . He said it was all a game . Which makes sense now , how you knew that he did that to women . ”
115249	115257	115258	115258	Her	9246	“ Yep . I spoke from experience . ”
115289	115298	115282	115282	Her	9246	“ And he told me about the baby . ”
115310	115318	115299	115299	I	884	“ What did he say about that ? ”
115319	115356	115299	115299	I	884	“ That you did n’t know who the father was , so he said it was his . So you would n’t be disowned or disgraced or whatever . Since he felt responsible for the situation . ”
115440	115452	115453	115453	She	9246	“ Hmm . Well , that about covers all of it . ”
115468	115505	115453	115453	She	9246	“ Silly Hudson . He should n’t feel responsible for anything . I was a grown woman . I can own up to my actions . He does n’t still feel that way , does he ? ”
115506	115515	115516	115516	I	884	“ Yeah . I think he still does . ”
115700	115726	115695	115695	Celia	9246	“ That ’s ridiculous . He really needs to get over himself . That was practically a decade ago now . It ’s old news . ”
115761	115772	115757	115757	she	9246	“ So you do n’t still have feelings for Hudson ? ”
115894	116002	115878	115878	Celia	9246	“ I totally have feelings for him , Laynie . He ’s my best friend . I ’ve loved him since I met him which was before I could even talk . But I ’m not in love with him . I do n’t think I ever was . He played me and I thought … well , anyway , I ’m not now . My mother will tell you differently , but she believes what she wants . If I was in love with him , I would have let that arranged marriage thing work out instead of supporting a sham to throw our parents off . ”
116003	116010	116011	116011	I	884	“ Yeah , that makes sense . ”
116039	116051	116028	116028	I	884	“ Then it does n’t bother you that we ’re together ? ”
116052	116121	116033	116037	a touchy - feely person	2187	“ Bother me ? I ’m happy for him ! For both of you , actually . Truthfully , I was beginning to think Sophia was right , that he could n’t possibly love anyone because he ’d never shown any inclination toward anyone . Except to mess with them , of course . It was really very sad . This is definitely a change for the better . ”
116148	116154	116155	116155	Celia	9246	“ What did I say ? ”
116177	116180	116168	116168	I	884	“ Nothing . ”
116229	116258	116218	116218	I	884	“ It ’s just , I ’ve been worrying it was too good to be true , and I keep wondering if maybe I’m … if he ’s … ”
116259	116268	116218	116218	I	884	“ If he ’s playing you , too ? ”
116276	116279	116269	116269	My	884	“ Yes . ”
116286	116295	116280	116280	She	2186	“ That is something I ’d worry about . ”
116308	116318	116319	116319	she	2186	“ I ’m not saying you should be worried , ”
116322	116360	116319	116319	she	2186	“ It would just cross my mind as a possibility . Especially knowing his past , and since this arrangement or relationship he has with you is so entirely different than anything he ’s ever had before . ”
116361	116371	116372	116372	Jesus	680	“ You know him , what do you think ? ”
116395	116434	116386	116386	She	2186	“ I do n’t think he ’s playing that game anymore . Really , I do n’t . He ’s had counseling , and it ’s been a good two years since he ’s had any … incidents . ”
116466	116478	116479	116479	Her	2186	“ I guess he could be having a relapse , but … ”
116484	116492	116479	116479	Her	2186	“ What has he said to you ? ”
116493	116513	116479	116479	Her	2186	“ That he wants to be with me . That ’s he ’s committed to making a relationship work . ”
116566	116653	116558	116558	she	9246	“ Let me tell you something about Hudson and the way he plays women . He does n’t lie . Ever . That ’s the brilliant part of his manipulative skills . He never says anything that you can throw back at him later . It ’s all truth spun to make you read more into what he ’s saying . He makes you think he ’s offering more than what he ’s really offering without ever saying the words . You know what I mean ? ”
116654	116659	116671	116671	she	2194	“ I think so . ”
116720	116736	116737	116737	Celia	9246	“ So if he ’s said those things to you , I ’d believe them , ”
116740	116786	116737	116737	Celia	9246	“ And he ’s never , ever brought a woman to his penthouse before . That ’s common knowledge . Even Sophia knows that . He ’s never wanted anyone to be able to find him after he , you know , broke their heart . ”
116893	116904	116880	116880	she	9246	“ Has he said … how he feels about you ? ”
116905	116908	116915	116915	he	2198	“ Yes . ”
116911	116913	116915	116915	he	2198	“No . ”
116943	116963	116928	116928	he	2198	“ I mean , he ’s said some things , but he has n’t actually said he loved me . ”
116976	117016	117017	117017	She	9246	“ I do n’t think he ’s ever told anyone he loved them . Not even his mother . So that might be a while , if ever . Do n’t take that omission as a sign of anything . ”
117020	117041	117042	117042	She	9246	“ No , I think you ’re good . I think this is good . I think it ’s real . ”
117048	117060	117042	117042	She	9246	“ Yay ! Hudson Pierce has a girlfriend ! How exciting ! ”
117061	117068	117042	117042	She	9246	“ Yeah , it is exciting . ”
117078	117082	117042	117042	She	9246	“ Totally exciting . ”
117238	117260	117233	117233	I	884	“ I ca n’t tell you how good it feels to talk to someone about him . Thank you so much . ”
117261	117272	117273	117273	She	9246	“ I bet . And no problem . Any time . ”
117276	117284	117273	117273	She	9246	“ How are things going with Sophia ? ”
117285	117291	117294	117294	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
117336	117362	117325	117325	she	442	“ I told her off the last time I saw her . I ’m hoping I do n’t have to deal with her anytime soon . ”
117363	117386	117387	117387	She	442	“ Oh . You do n’t have plans to see her then ? Like , to show her your coupledom and everything ? ”
117419	117443	117462	117462	Celia	9246	“ No , thank god . I think Hudson ’s given up on convincing her of anything . Which is fine by me . ”
117444	117451	117462	117462	Celia	9246	“ Totally . Who needs Sophia ? ”
117469	117474	117462	117462	Celia	9246	“You’re chummy with her . ”
117488	117507	117462	117462	Celia	9246	“ Well , I live by that friends close , enemies closer philosophy . It works for me . ”
117508	117517	117518	117518	I	884	“ Yeah it does . She adores you . ”
117536	117584	117462	117462	Celia	9246	“ She adores me because she adores my mother . Besides , she thinks that if I ’m with Hudson , she ’ll have complete access to his life . Like I ’d share anything personal with her . I have her snowed , that ’s all . ”
117585	117604	117618	117618	she	9246	“ Then all I have to do to get her on my side is to snow her too ? ”
117605	117608	117609	117609	Celia	9246	“ Maybe . ”
117623	117646	117618	117618	she	9246	“ Seriously , forget her . She ’s not worth it . Have you heard about the time that Hudson told her — ”
117656	117668	117669	117669	Celia	9246	“ Oh , my , is it really one o’clock already ? ”
117674	117692	117693	117693	She	9246	“ It really is . I have a full afternoon . I ’ve got to get going . ”
117701	117718	117693	117693	She	9246	“ I ’m sorry to rush off like this . It was great talking to you . ”
117719	117726	117727	117727	I	884	“ Yeah , this was nice . ”
117788	117796	117797	117797	Celia	9246	“ We should totally get together again , ”
117810	117813	117814	117814	She	9246	“ Here . ”
117828	117847	117814	117814	She	9246	“ My cell is on here . Call me and we can do coffee . Tomorrow , maybe ? ”
117848	117854	117855	117855	I	884	“ I ’d like that . ”
117876	117888	117889	117889	She	9246	“ Awesome . Give me a call in the morning then . ”
117892	117946	117889	117889	She	9246	“ Oh , and if I do n’t answer , keep calling . I have a nasty habit of leaving my phone in random places and if you call over and over then I will get to you . And I ’ll find my phone ! It ’s a total win - win . ”
117956	117959	117947	117947	I	884	“ Perfect . ”
117960	117971	117972	117972	She	9246	“ Great ! Tomorrow then . Give Hudson my love . ”
117994	118029	118030	118030	Her	9246	“ You know , it really is about time Hudson had someone in his life , and I ’m so glad it ’s someone who loves and understands him as it seems you do . ”
118054	118064	118069	118069	he	2217	“ Thanks . I do . I get him . ”
118075	118081	118082	118082	Her	9246	“ I know you do . ”
118087	118106	118082	118082	Her	9246	“ He ’s told me things about you , too . I hope that does n’t bother you . ”
118220	118231	118216	118216	I	884	“ No , it does n’t bother me . Surprisingly . ”
118232	118235	118236	118236	She	9246	“ Good . ”
118239	118281	118236	118236	She	9246	“ I wo n’t tell anyone , of course . I ’m glad that I know though . I can see how perfect you are for him because of what you ’ve been through yourself . I ’m on your side . ”
118282	118291	118292	118292	She	9246	“ Thank you . I ’m very grateful . ”
118295	118307	118292	118292	She	9246	“ Okay , well , I ’m off . Good luck ! ”
118871	118875	118876	118877	David Lindt	180	“ Bachelorette parties ? ”
118973	118979	118954	118954	I	884	“ Yes . Bachelorette parties . ”
118980	118989	118963	118963	my	884	“ Seriously ? That ’s your big idea ? ”
118990	118998	118999	118999	I	884	“ Come on , it ’s perfect ! ”
119030	119070	119028	119028	David	180	“ It ’s wedding season and the bubble rooms are the perfect place for privacy while still being surrounded by the club scene . You know as well as I do the stuff that goes on in those rooms . ”
119243	119260	119232	119232	David	180	“ We ’ve had bachelorette parties in here before . Not many , but a few . ”
119261	119272	119232	119232	David	180	“ And they always go well , do n’t they ? ”
119273	119280	119281	119281	He	180	“ The customers are always pleased . ”
119527	119542	119524	119524	he	180	“ How do you expect to draw people to book the rooms for that ? ”
119543	119546	119519	119519	Pen	286	“ Marketing . ”
119582	119638	119572	119572	I	884	“ We ’ve never advertised those rooms to any specific market . They ’re underutilized and wasted space compared to what they could be used for . And if we bundled the rooms in packages designed specifically for soon - to - be - married brides , I think we could really attract some attention . ”
119639	119647	119753	119753	my	884	“ Yeah , I see some potential . ”
119650	119656	119753	119753	my	884	“ What ’s your strategy ? ”
119657	119749	119572	119572	I	884	“ I need some time to put it all together into a formal plan , but I ’m thinking I could book some meetings with wedding planners . If I can offer a good deal , they ’d tell their clients . Maybe we can give them referral bonuses or offer them a certain percentage of our booking fee as a kickback . But first we need to design some packages . Include some party trays and a certain dollar amount from the bar and we ’ve got something to sell . ”
119808	119815	119816	119816	I	884	“ So what do you think ? ”
119825	119838	119816	119816	I	884	“ I think you ’re onto something . Let ’s do it . ”
119849	119864	119839	119839	I	884	“ I ’ve arranged the cook . Will you still be home for dinner ? ”
119865	119875	119876	119876	I	884	“ I would n’t miss it for the world , ”
119895	119898	119839	119839	I	884	“ Pierce ? ”
119907	119914	119899	119899	David	180	“ Yeah , it ’s Hudson . ”
119915	119919	119899	119899	David	180	“ Something good ? ”
119931	119935	119924	119924	I	884	“ Everything good . ”
119954	119977	119943	119943	I	884	“ I ’m meeting him for dinner . Do n’t worry , I ’ll be back by the time my shift starts . ”
119978	119992	119993	119993	David	180	“ Actually , I wanted to talk to you about changing your schedule . ”
120009	120090	119993	119993	David	180	“ I promoted you so that you could do this kind of stuff . We have enough managerial coverage . If we need someone else — which I ’m sure we will if your plans work out like I know they will — Sasha ’s ready to be a manager . Your gift , what you bring to The Sky Launch , is your business ideas . I need you to go work magic . That ’s not my department . ”
120091	120094	120095	120095	I	884	“ So , ”
120100	120106	120095	120095	I	884	“ what are you saying ? ”
120107	120208	119993	119993	David	180	“ I ’m saying make your own schedule . I need you on the clock forty hours a week — not a problem for you , you work addict — but you can put it in whenever you need it . Set up those meetings with the wedding planners . And I ’d like to go forward with your idea of expanding hours and our services . That ’s going to take a lot of daytime planning as well . You ’ll need to meet with cooks and additional staff . It ’s going to be a lot of work . ”
120223	120241	120338	120338	Liesl	166	“ Seriously ? I mean , seriously do all that amazing stuff and make my own hours ? ”
120286	120305	120348	120348	She	166	“ Yes , seriously . I would n’t joke about this shit . Start with taking tonight off . ”
120306	120323	120368	120368	she	166	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . You ca n’t run the upstairs bar with one person . ”
120324	120335	120348	120348	She	166	“ Liesl ’s coming in . It ’s already covered . ”
120415	120437	120396	120396	she	166	“ She worked for me the whole time I was in the Hamptons . I ca n’t make her do that . ”
120438	120497	120498	120498	He	2252	“ She volunteered . We hired that new waitress , and Liesl ’s determined she be trained right — her words , not mine . And if you ’re going to set up some meetings for tomorrow , you ’ll need to adjust to being awake during the day . Right now you ’re sort of a vampire . ”
120506	120516	120498	120498	He	2252	“ A tan vampire , but a vamp nonetheless . ”
120554	120572	120545	120545	he	2252	“ Thank you , David . Thank you , thank you , thank you . I ’m … ”
120586	120591	120545	120545	he	2252	“ Just thank you . ”
120592	120597	120598	120598	He	2252	“ You deserve it . ”
120613	120618	120598	120598	He	2252	“ Hug it out ? ”
120619	120628	120629	120629	Hudson	1556	“ That got me in trouble last time . ”
120745	120751	120737	120737	I	884	“ Settle for a handshake ? ”
121035	121044	121051	121051	he	180	“ Well , hello to you , too . ”
121045	121050	121051	121051	he	180	“ You ’re late , ”
121057	121060	121051	121051	he	180	“ And ? ”
121061	121065	121066	121066	His	180	“ I worried . ”
121100	121108	121089	121089	he	180	“ That something had happened to me ? ”
121109	121116	121089	121089	he	180	“ That you were n’t coming . ”
121126	121141	121117	121117	I	884	“ Why Hudson Alexander Pierce , did you worry I ’d stand you up ? ”
121150	121163	121117	121117	I	884	“ Do n’t you realize I ’m the kinda girl that sticks ? ”
121175	121194	121164	121164	He	180	“ If you acted as smart as you are , you would have stood me up weeks ago . ”
121195	121204	121164	121164	He	180	“ Good thing I do n’t act smart . ”
121205	121213	121214	121214	He	180	“ Good thing for me , yes . ”
121254	121258	121259	121259	I	884	“ Guess what . ”
121277	121286	121273	121273	his	180	“ You do n’t have to work tonight . ”
121298	121306	121287	121287	I	884	“ How do you always know everything ? ”
121307	121312	121313	121313	He	180	“ I do n’t . ”
121328	121356	121313	121313	He	180	“ But where you ’re concerned I make an effort . David called me this afternoon and asked if I approved of you making your own hours . ”
121357	121385	121386	121386	I	884	“ And you said , ‘ Yes , because then I can conform my schedule to Alayna ’s so we can fuck as much as possible . ’ ”
121397	121408	121411	121411	I	884	“ I said I thought it was a good idea . ”
121418	121427	121411	121411	I	884	“ But I was thinking what you said . ”
121436	121441	121411	121411	I	884	“ I love you . ”
121448	121470	121442	121442	He	180	“ I hope that my ability to change your working hours is not the sole basis of your fondness for me . ”
121471	121479	121484	121484	him	180	“ It is not . Trust me . ”
121504	121511	121493	121493	he	180	“ Dinner ’s ready , precious . ”
121557	121574	121549	121549	He	180	“ These would have a more dramatic effect if it were n’t so light in here . ”
121575	121598	121599	121599	I	884	“ Yes , it ’s terrible that your penthouse has floor - to - ceiling windows that let in so much sun , ”
121602	121609	121599	121599	I	884	“ Honestly , it ’s lovely . ”
121668	121679	121657	121657	I	884	“ Where ’s the cook ? Did she abandon you ? ”
121680	121700	121701	121701	He	180	“ She did not . She cooked and then she left . Our plates are waiting under the warmer . ”
121713	121724	121701	121701	He	180	“ I presume I can manage the service without her . ”
121735	121748	121725	121725	I	884	“ Honey , you do n’t need anyone ’s help with service . ”
121749	121753	121754	121754	He	180	“ Hey now . ”
121767	121794	121754	121754	He	180	“ Food first . I need my energy to keep up with you . But if we get through dinner , perhaps there will be dessert . ”
121795	121803	121759	121759	his	180	“ A naughty dessert , I hope . ”
121804	121809	121754	121754	He	180	“ No hoping necessary . ”
121897	121927	121940	121940	He	180	“ Do you want me to get you in touch with my company event planners ? Not that they ’d be helpful in the pre - wedding party arena . ”
121928	121939	121940	121940	He	180	“ Nah , I got some things set up already . ”
121978	121988	121974	121974	he	180	“ Let me know if you change your mind . ”
122047	122055	122056	122056	I	884	“ This is so good , Hudson , ”
122066	122074	122056	122056	I	884	“ Wherever did you find this cook ? ”
122075	122109	122056	122056	I	884	“ She used to be sous - chef at one of my restaurants . Things did n’t work out with her and another staff member , so she works privately for me now . ”
122126	122129	122117	122117	I	884	“ Fierce ? ”
122130	122136	122056	122056	I	884	“ That ’s the one . ”
122189	122199	122177	122177	My	884	“ Would she consider working at The Sky Launch ? ”
122200	122208	122173	122173	she	2271	“ Then who would cook for us ? ”
122224	122227	122218	122218	Hudson	1556	“ us , ”
122232	122250	122218	122218	Hudson	1556	“ For private events then . It does n’t have to be a full - time gig . ”
122251	122291	122308	122308	girlfriend	1150	“ I like the way your business brain works , Alayna . But why do n’t we put the job away for the night ? I ’d like to spend time with the other sexy parts of my girlfriend . ”
122388	122410	122372	122372	he	2270	“ Other than work , how was your afternoon ? I noticed the books came . Did the delivery go okay ? ”
122429	122445	122411	122411	I	884	“ They did , and yes , it went fine . Celia accompanied the delivery . ”
122460	122463	122452	122452	he	2270	“ Oh ? ”
122584	122606	122578	122578	I	884	“ She surprised me . I guess I was in the shower when she buzzed up so she let herself in . ”
122611	122620	122607	122607	His	2270	“ I need to take away her key . ”
122621	122627	122628	122628	I	884	“ Yes , you do . ”
122643	122659	122628	122628	I	884	“ But it was n’t bad . In fact , we had a nice chat . ”
122667	122677	122660	122660	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t like that . At all . ”
122720	122731	122678	122678	I	884	“ Do n’t get all panicked . It was fine . ”
122732	122754	122755	122755	He	2270	“ I do n’t want you two to spend time together . Remember , in my script you are n’t friends . ”
122773	122797	122768	122768	I	884	“ Come on , that ’s not fair . I only want to feel close to you and she ’s your best friend . ”
122804	122815	122798	122798	He	2270	“ She ’s my only friend . It ’s different . ”
122833	122845	122816	122816	I	884	“ She did n’t give away any deep dark Hudson secrets . ”
122846	122850	122798	122798	He	2270	“ Says you . ”
122851	122864	122865	122865	I	884	“ She only said she was happy that you ’d found me . ”
122873	122880	122865	122865	I	884	“ She thinks you deserve someone . ”
122889	122900	122901	122901	He	2270	“ That ’s a deep dark Hudson secret right there . ”
122910	122931	122901	122901	He	2270	“ So deep and dark , it ’s a lie . I do n’t deserve you and I never will . ”
122932	122936	122937	122937	I	884	“ Shut up . ”
122948	122967	122937	122937	I	884	“ You deserve much better than me . You ’re out of my league and everyone knows it . ”
122968	122971	122972	122972	His	2270	“ Alayna — ”
122983	123009	122972	122972	His	2270	“ How about instead of arguing over who deserves whom , we agree that we fit pretty damn well together and leave it at that . ”
123010	123021	123024	123024	he	2270	“ I do n’t want you spending time with Celia . ”
123075	123098	123167	123167	She	2278	“All right , I wo n’t spend time with her . And I do n’t want you spending time with her either . ”
123099	123107	123044	123044	he	2270	“ I can live with that compromise . ”
123108	123112	123113	123113	I	884	“ You can ? ”
123120	123146	123044	123044	he	2270	“ Yes . I barely see her anyway . From now on , if I have to see her , it will be with you . ”
123147	123150	123170	123171	my friend	8280	“ Agreed . ”
123173	123176	123167	123167	She	2278	“ Good . ”
123185	123194	123167	123167	She	2278	“ We do fit pretty damn well together . ”
123195	123202	123167	123167	She	2278	“ Now who ’s getting naughty ? ”
123216	123223	123203	123203	He	8280	“ It is time for dessert . ”
123224	123235	123236	123236	I	884	“ Hold that thought . I ’ll be right back . ”
123447	123470	123437	123437	He	8380	“ Holy , fuck , Alayna . You look so goddamned hot , you ’ve surpassed naughty and gone straight to sinful . ”
123471	123477	123478	123478	I	884	“ Why , thank you . ”
123562	123568	123569	123569	His	8380	“ What are you doing ? ”
123581	123593	123594	123594	I	884	“ You served dinner . I figured I should serve dessert . ”
123682	123689	123690	123690	I	884	“ Holy , fuck , Hudson , ”
123704	123709	123696	123696	I	884	“ Talk about sinful . ”
123786	123795	123796	123796	His	8380	“ You ’re so fucking beautiful , Alayna . ”
123806	123811	123796	123796	His	8380	“ So fucking beautiful . ”
123812	123817	123820	123820	I	884	“ So are you . ”
123842	123850	123833	123833	I	884	“ Do you like fucking my tits ? ”
123851	123860	123838	123838	his	8380	“ I love anything you do to me . ”
123861	123866	123867	123867	I	884	“ Is that so ? ”
124008	124013	123996	123996	He	8380	“ Jesus , yes . ”
124135	124141	124142	124142	he	8380	“ Alayna , slow down , ”
124163	124166	124167	124167	His	8380	“ Alayna ! ”
124242	124249	124250	124250	he	8380	“ You feel amazing , Alayna , ”
124267	124277	124250	124250	he	8380	“ I was about to come in your mouth . ”
124278	124285	124286	124286	I	884	“ That would have been fine . ”
124297	124308	124309	124309	His	8380	“ But I much prefer coming in your tight cunt . ”
124322	124330	124309	124309	His	8380	“ Fuck , I ’m coming now . ”
124412	124418	124396	124396	Hudson	1556	“ I apologize for that . ”
124451	124467	124396	124396	Hudson	1556	“ I got carried away . I did n’t give you the attention you deserved . ”
124478	124508	124470	124470	I	884	“ I love it when you get carried away . You rarely let yourself go . It ’s a nice change . Not to mention , it ’s hot . ”
124542	124560	124534	124534	I	884	“ Someday , though , you ’re going to let me suck you off until you finish . ”
124561	124572	124526	124526	he	8380	“ You know I love to come buried inside you . ”
124573	124581	124582	124582	I	884	“ God , I do , too . ”
124587	124608	124582	124582	I	884	“ But I ’d also love to have you come in my mouth . I ’m craving it , actually . ”
124615	124619	124609	124609	His	8380	“ Stay tonight . ”
124650	124653	124646	124646	I	884	“ Okay . ”
124980	124983	125000	125000	His	8380	“ What ? ”
124984	124994	125000	125000	His	8380	“ You look good in my t - shirt . ”
124995	124999	125000	125000	His	8380	“ I know . ”
125008	125015	125000	125000	His	8380	“ You look better without it . ”
125027	125035	125019	125019	He	8380	“ What did you choose to read ? ”
125048	125063	125019	125019	He	8380	“ The Talented Mr. Ripley . Interesting . A book about a true sociopath . ”
125268	125277	125260	125260	I	884	“ Hudson , can I ask you something ? ”
125301	125325	125278	125278	He	8380	“ Yes , I will do wicked things to your body , but only if you promise to do wicked things to mine . ”
125329	125335	125326	125326	I	884	“ I ’m being serious . ”
125336	125340	125341	125341	His	8380	“ So am I. ”
125358	125367	125341	125341	His	8380	“ But wickedness can wait . Ask me . ”
125368	125373	125374	125374	I	884	“ I was thinking … ”
125391	125421	125374	125374	I	884	“ Celia had said that you manipulated women , as if it was more than her . What does that mean exactly ? Like , what did you do ? ”
125426	125436	125422	125422	His	8380	“ I thought you said you just chatted today . ”
125437	125441	125442	125442	I	884	“ We did . ”
125449	125467	125468	125468	I	884	“ She did n’t mention that today at all . Or anything like it . I swear . ”
125474	125523	125468	125468	I	884	“ It was before , at the charity fashion event of your mother ’s and I ’ve been thinking about it . I should know , do n’t you think ? If we ’re going to be open and honest with each other , I need to know . ”
125524	125531	125532	125532	He	8380	“ No , you do n’t . ”
125563	125570	125532	125532	He	8380	“ I do need to know . ”
125571	125575	125576	125576	He	8380	“ No way . ”
125605	125657	125594	125594	I	884	“ Hudson , I get it . I do . You want to ignore it and leave things in the past . But you ’re always going to be scared that I ca n’t love you through anything if you do n’t give me the chance to prove that I will . ”
125671	125700	125658	125658	He	8380	“ But what if you do n’t ? Have you considered that ? Has it crossed your mind that I might have done things you could never forgive ? ”
125701	125706	125594	125594	I	884	“ There ’s nothing — ”
125712	125719	125707	125707	He	8380	“ You do n’t know that . ”
125724	125737	125720	125720	I	884	“ Is there anything I could have done to make you … ? ”
125766	125776	125758	125758	he	8380	“ To change the way you feel about me ? ”
125777	125784	125758	125758	he	8380	“ It ’s not the same . ”
125785	125793	125798	125798	he	8380	“ You do n’t know that either . ”
125845	125850	125851	125851	I	884	“ Then tell me . ”
125864	125867	125851	125851	I	884	“ Anything ? ”
125877	125893	125868	125868	He	8380	“ The restraining order against you was filed by Paul Kresh . Who was he ? ”
125923	125932	125912	125912	he	8380	“ See ? You ca n’t tell me . ”
125933	125939	125940	125940	I	884	“ He was a guy , ”
125964	125978	125956	125956	I	884	“ Just a guy who picked me up once when I was clubbing . ”
125979	125984	125912	125912	he	8380	“ You fucked him . ”
125989	125992	125912	125912	he	8380	“ Yes . ”
125998	126002	126003	126003	His	8380	“ Go on . ”
126008	126039	125956	125956	I	884	“ He took me to his place . And after … well , after , he wanted me to leave . But I played drunk and stayed the whole night . ”
126040	126044	125956	125956	I	884	“ Then what ? ”
126045	126127	125956	125956	I	884	“ Then I went through his things while he was sleeping and discovered wedding invitations . He had a fiancée . She was out of town for the weekend or something and I was a girl he ’d picked up . But he did n’t realize that I ’d been crushing on him for weeks . I ’d seen him with her , and I did n’t care . When I saw him alone that night , I made myself available . ”
126155	126209	126141	126141	I	884	“ Of course , he wanted me gone , to pretend it never happened . Wanted me to forget his address . He never gave me his number , but I ’d gotten that when he was sleeping , too . Sent myself a text from his phone so I ’d have it . ”
126234	126245	126246	126246	My	884	“ I could n’t let him go . I thought … ”
126254	126263	126246	126246	My	884	“ I do n’t know what I thought . ”
126275	126284	126264	126264	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , you do . Tell me . ”
126301	126338	126285	126285	I	884	“ I thought he was my soul mate . That I was meant to be with him or something . Before I even actually talked to him . I know . Crazy . It was crazy . ”
126345	126350	126339	126339	I	884	“ I was crazy . ”
126351	126365	126366	126366	Hudson	1556	“ No , you were n’t . You only wanted to be loved . ”
126377	126380	126381	126381	I	884	“ Yes , ”
126430	126433	126434	126434	I	884	“ Anyway , ”
126442	126532	126434	126434	I	884	“ I did n’t have a job . I was living off my inheritance , which is gone now , and so I had plenty of time to wait outside his apartment and follow him to work . Every day . For months . Two ? Three ? I do n’t remember exactly . One day , I told the security guard he was my boyfriend . I convinced him to let me in his office during lunch . When Paul came back , I was waiting for him . ”
126538	126541	126533	126533	I	884	“ Naked . ”
126548	126569	126570	126570	My	884	“ He turned me away , H. Called security before I had a chance to even throw some clothes on . ”
126578	126587	126570	126570	My	884	“ He filed the restraining order after that . ”
126649	126667	126632	126632	Hudson	1556	“ But that ’s not all , is it ? Your record says you violated the order . ”
126674	126682	126683	126683	God	8844	“ I , um , I did . ”
126723	126730	126711	126711	I	884	“ I became friends with Melissa . ”
126738	126742	126731	126731	He	884	“ His fiancée . ”
126743	126836	126731	126731	He	884	“ Yeah . I joined her Pilates class and became buddy - buddy with her . So she started inviting me out with her and her friends . Eventually I ended up at a party that Paul was at too . He was livid . And he had to decide if he wanted to ignore it or report me . If he reported me , Melissa would find out about the one - night . I would n’t leave things alone , so he reported it . And she broke things off . ”
126837	126842	126855	126855	he	884	“ He deserved that . ”
126843	126846	126847	126847	I	884	“ Maybe . ”
126874	126882	126884	126884	Hudson	1556	“ He deserved worse in my book . ”
126907	126918	126899	126899	my	884	“ And Paul ’s the only one this happened with ? ”
126925	126937	126899	126899	my	884	“ He was the only one who went to the police . ”
126938	126942	126943	126943	Hudson	1556	“ I see . ”
126970	126985	126956	126956	he	884	“ Why would you think that this would change how I feel about you ? ”
126986	127004	126899	126899	my	884	“ Are you kidding ? Are n’t you worried I ’ll become that hung up on you ? ”
127005	127017	127018	127018	He	884	“ I ’m hoping you become that hung up on me . ”
127026	127053	127018	127018	He	884	“ Paul was a fucking asshole who did n’t realize what he had in front of him . I do . Get hung up on me . ”
127054	127062	127063	127063	I	884	“ I am hung up on you ! ”
127070	127091	127063	127063	I	884	“ But careful what you wish for . If I go crazy on you , you ’ll want me gone . ”
127105	127117	127092	127092	He	884	“ I ’d never drive you away . Not on purpose . ”
127175	127223	127157	127157	I	884	“ But what if I started to doubt you ? That ’s happened before , too . Where I did n’t trust anything my boyfriend said to me , no matter how innocent they were . And then I snooped and invaded privacy and people got hurt . ”
127224	127242	127243	127243	He	884	“ Then I simply have to make sure that you never have any reason to doubt me . ”
127253	127266	127243	127243	He	884	“ Snoop away . I have nothing to hide from you here . ”
127281	127288	127275	127275	we	2308	“ You ’re hiding your past . ”
127292	127323	127289	127289	He	884	“ I ’m not hiding my past . There ’s simply nothing worth talking about . It ’s ugly . Why would you want to focus on the bad things ? ”
127324	127338	127289	127289	He	884	“ It ’s not focusing ; it ’s sharing and then moving on . ”
127344	127355	127289	127289	He	884	“ I told you mine . That ’s not fair . ”
127364	127373	127374	127374	I	884	“ Come on . Anything . One thing . ”
127408	127418	127374	127374	I	884	“ One thing and you ’ll leave it alone ? ”
127423	127429	127430	127430	He	884	“ Okay , one thing . ”
127433	127471	127472	127472	He	884	“ It was a game . Always a game . And my favorite was the same one I played on Celia . Make a woman fall for me , and when she did , I was done . ”
127503	127599	127493	127493	he	884	“ There was one time , though , I wanted to see if I could make someone fall for someone else , someone they had no interest in . I knew this guy , Owen , who was a real ass . A complete man - whore . And this woman , Andrea — a girl , really . She was in my tennis club my second year of college . Very shy , simple , homely . I discovered she had a thing for me . Having a thing for me was very dangerous . ”
127606	127610	127600	127600	He	2309	“ Still is . ”
127616	127626	127611	127611	I	884	“ No , it ’s not . Go on . ”
127627	127706	127611	127611	I	884	“ I set her up with Owen . Not just on a date , more . I played silent matchmaker . Got them together . I convinced Owen he was doing me a favor by taking her out a few times . Meanwhile , I ’d fill him with all these stories of how amazing Andrea was , how her true beauty was inside . And it happened — they fell for each other . Completely . Sincerely . ”
127712	127719	127707	127707	I	884	“ That ’s a beautiful story . ”
127720	127731	127707	127707	I	884	“ Then I fucked her and showed Owen the pictures . ”
127732	127738	127707	127707	I	884	“ Oh , my god . ”
127787	127859	127777	127777	Hudson	1556	“ Andrea tried to tell Owen it was a mistake , that I ’d tricked her , which I had . I did n’t rape her — I never raped anyone . But he would n’t listen to her . They were both … broken , is the best way to describe it . Andrea left school in the middle of the semester . I never heard anything about her again . ”
127860	127864	127865	127865	My	884	“ And Owen ? ”
127876	127907	127865	127865	My	884	“ He went back to sleeping with anyone with two legs . Last I heard he ’d gotten HIV . I do n’t know . I lost track of him . ”
127958	127975	127953	127953	His	884	“ I told you , you did n’t want to hear it . I told you — ”
127976	127985	127986	127986	I	884	“ Just give me a second to process , ”
128053	128092	128045	128045	My	884	“ See , Alayna ? See why your past means nothing to me ? Compared to me , you were an angel . You hurt people because you loved too much . I hurt people because I could . ”
128186	128189	128161	128161	I	884	“ No . ”
128201	128264	128190	128190	I	884	“ No . You hurt people because you did n’t have any idea what love really was . You were trying to understand it in the only way you knew how . It ’s horrible , yes . But it ’s forgivable . I forgive you . I forgive a thousand worse things you may have done . I can forgive anything . ”
128273	128326	128265	128265	I	884	“ Because I love you . I love you too much , like I always do , but this time I do n’t regret it and I do n’t wish I could take it back because you need it . So take it from me , H. Take it all from me . ”
128483	128496	128497	128498	Julia Swaggert	293	“ What do you call these rooms again ? They ’re amazing ! ”
128527	128531	128532	128532	I	884	“ Bubble rooms , ”
128575	128582	128583	128583	I	884	“ And when they ’re occupied — ”
128608	128621	128597	128597	Julia	293	“ Ha - ha . Awesome . Can people see inside them ? ”
128622	128667	128597	128597	Julia	293	“ Unfortunately , yes . We ’d have too many legal issues if we were to install one - way mirrors in them . But when it ’s dark on the floor , you ca n’t see very much inside them . Mostly silhouettes . ”
128668	128671	128597	128597	Julia	293	“ Hot . ”
128735	128748	128749	128749	She	293	“ This is totally perfect for Bachelorette parties , as you suggested . ”
128768	128798	128799	128799	She	293	“ Actually , I can think of a few types of events that might be interested in this venue . If you can come up with some pricing packages — ”
128815	128819	128820	128820	Damn	294	“ Sure thing . ”
128885	128904	128881	128881	I	884	“ Do you have some things you ’d like to see in particular as part of the packages ? ”
128920	128961	128905	128905	She	293	“ A dollar amount at the bar is a must . Perhaps a selection of appetizers . Few pre - brides will be expecting dinner when they ’re clubbing , so light on the food and heavy on the drinks . ”
128973	128992	128968	128968	I	884	“ Would add - ons be of interest ? Like male waiters or a penis - shaped cake ? ”
128996	129006	128993	128993	She	293	“ I think you know what you ’re doing . ”
129016	129024	129025	129025	she	293	“ Ah , that ’s my partner , ”
129031	129054	129055	129055	She	293	“ He was overseeing arrangements for an event we have later and said he ’d join me here if he got free . ”
129064	129077	129055	129055	She	293	“ Yay , he ’s here . Mind if he comes up ? ”
129078	129111	129167	129167	We	2320	“ Not at all . The front doors are locked , though , since we ’re not open during the day . I ’ll have to walk down and let him in . ”
129112	129119	129120	129120	She	293	“ I ’ll come with you . ”
129130	129166	129120	129120	She	293	“ I want to get his feedback from the moment he enters . See if he loves it as much as I do . I ca n’t believe I had no idea this place existed ! ”
129204	129217	129191	129191	She	293	“ I ’m so glad there ’s a bar on each floor . ”
129218	129276	129191	129191	She	293	“ There are two bars on this floor : the main one and a smaller side one that we only operate on the weekends . Food is only served upstairs . So the first floor is tailored for drinking and dancing while the upstairs level with the bubble rooms and lounging areas is geared more toward socializing . ”
129277	129291	129191	129191	She	293	“ Nice . And you can rent out the entire club for events ? ”
129292	129296	129191	129191	She	293	“ Of course . ”
129297	129321	129322	129322	She	293	“ Can you put together some packaging for that ? I know some corporations that might like this for holiday parties and such . ”
129334	129344	129322	129322	She	293	“ And what ’s this ? An information desk ? ”
129345	129352	129322	129322	She	293	“ That ’s the coat check . ”
129381	129394	129395	129395	I	884	“ Oh , whoops ! That ’s not supposed to be there . ”
129409	129421	129395	129395	I	884	“ I ’ll put this away while you let him in . ”
129465	129478	129449	129449	Julia	293	“ It ’s an amazing club , baby . A total gem . ”
129492	129532	129533	129533	Julia	293	“ Plus we ’d be hooked up to Pierce Industries , and that ’s a major bonus for us . We have to score this deal . I can already think of two couples this place would appeal to . ”
129546	129552	129533	129533	Julia	293	“ The Fredericks for one . ”
129560	129583	129553	129553	Julia	293	“ Here she is . Alayna Withers , I ’d like you to meet my boyfriend and partner at Party Planners Plus — ”
129602	129606	129584	129585	Her partner	2326	“ Paul Kresh . ”
129718	129729	129708	129708	she	1255	“ Paul , this is Alayna , the … Wait . ”
129772	129785	129786	129786	She	293	“ I ’m sorry . I do n’t even know your title . ”
129847	129855	129835	129835	Julia	293	“ Um , Events and Promotional Manager . ”
129901	129907	129895	129895	he	379	“ Pleasure to meet you . ”
129939	129947	129927	129927	I	884	“ No , the pleasure ’s mine . ”
130025	130042	130043	130043	She	2335	“ Paul , you ’ve got to see this place . Can we repeat the tour ? ”
130089	130102	130083	130083	Paul	379	“ Actually , honey , we ’ve really got to get going . ”
130119	130152	130103	130103	She	2335	“ Yeah , you ’re right . We have a thing tonight . Last minute details and all . Mind if I use the little girl ’s room before we take off ? ”
130168	130185	130153	130153	She	2335	“ Not at all , it ’s back at the top of the ramp , to — ”
130191	130195	130186	130186	She	2335	“ I remember . ”
130228	130319	130210	130210	I	884	“ Paul , I had no idea , I swear . I did n’t have a clue that Julia was your partner or that you worked at Party Planners Plus or that you ’d be here today or ever . I would have canceled if your name was anywhere attached to the business website , and how the hell would I ever know that you ’d become an event planner anyway ? Because when I knew you , you were an accountant in that stupid firm on Forty - Seventh — ”
130320	130325	130326	130326	He	2339	“ Stop , Alayna . ”
130342	130360	130361	130361	I	884	“ I know you did n’t plan this . There ’s no way you would have known . ”
130378	130399	130361	130361	I	884	“ I ’m still an unofficial partner . I ’ve been doing Julia ’s accounting and we only recently decided … ”
130407	130420	130400	130400	His	2339	“ Anyway , that ’s not important . The important thing is — ”
130421	130433	130435	130435	I	884	“ That we absolutely do n’t work together . I know . ”
130459	130479	130435	130435	I	884	“ The restraining order was for five years , and I think there ’s two years or so left . ”
130480	130488	130489	130489	he	2339	“ A little less than two years , ”
130492	130506	130489	130489	he	2339	“ But that does n’t matter . We have to work together anyway . ”
130507	130510	130511	130511	I	884	“ What ? ”
130544	130592	130537	130537	he	2339	“ I ca n’t ruin this deal for Julia . She ’s hired new people recently and she ’s trying to expand the business . It ’s a good time for her , but she needs connections like this club . Connections with people like Hudson Pierce . ”
130593	130609	130610	130610	Hudson	1556	“ But I ca n’t be anywhere near you , let alone working with you . ”
130691	130718	130688	130688	Paul	379	“ I ’m not going to report you . You did n’t know . And going forward I ’m not going to say a damn word . ”
130723	130738	130719	130719	His	379	“ Unless you fucking show up on my doorstep , or in my office — ”
130739	130744	130745	130745	I	884	“ I ’m not ! ”
130771	130796	130763	130763	I	884	“ I ’m not like that anymore . I ’m better . I got counseling . I have n’t even thought about you since … ”
130809	130822	130763	130763	I	884	“ Well , I ’m better . And I ’m with someone . ”
130868	130884	130885	130885	Paul	379	“ Good . That ’s good to hear . I ’m glad you ’re better . ”
130890	130909	130885	130885	Paul	379	“ And I believe you . You look better . I do n’t know … healthy or something . ”
130910	130914	130885	130885	Paul	379	“ Thank you . ”
130981	130998	130967	130967	he	379	“ Look , Julia knows nothing about you or Melissa or that I was engaged before . ”
130999	131008	131009	131009	I	884	“ Nice . Secretive relationships for the win , ”
131018	131054	131055	131055	His	379	“ We ’ll simply have to agree to keep all the past under wraps . Not a word that we ’ve ever met before today . We can do that . I know you can . ”
131071	131084	131055	131055	His	379	“ You were always good at acting like things were just fine . ”
131096	131112	131085	131085	I	884	“ Paul , this is a bad idea . A really bad idea for me . ”
131125	131142	131113	131113	He	379	“ You owe me . You owe me this at least . Do n’t you think ? ”
131219	131223	131224	131224	I	884	“ All right . ”
131231	131242	131224	131224	I	884	“ All right . I ’ll pretend we just met . ”
131243	131269	131224	131224	I	884	“ Fine . You ’ll be working mostly with Julia anyway . We wo n’t see each other . It should n’t be an issue . ”
131282	131287	131224	131224	I	884	“ Alayna , hey ! ”
131338	131347	131348	131348	My	884	“ What — what are you doing here ? ”
131353	131372	131348	131348	My	884	“ You never called me for coffee and I did n’t have your number so I stopped by . ”
131444	131453	131460	131460	her	293	“ How did you know I was here ? ”
131468	131473	131460	131460	her	293	“ Jordan told me . ”
131492	131497	131500	131500	Celia	9246	“ Is something wrong ? ”
131504	131511	131512	131512	My	884	“ No … I … well . ”
131529	131534	131512	131512	My	884	“ Everything ’s fine . ”
131551	131563	131548	131549	Fucking Paul	298	“ Celia this is a potential business associate , Paul Kresh . ”
131577	131590	131564	131564	I	884	“ This is a friend of my boyfriend ’s , Celia Werner . ”
131596	131603	131591	131591	Paul	379	“ As in , Warren Werner ? ”
131604	131609	131610	131610	Celia	9246	“ Uh - huh . ”
131640	131664	131634	131634	Paul	379	“ We did an event for your mother once . I did n’t actually talk to you , but I saw you around . ”
131665	131675	131634	131634	Paul	379	“ What company did you say you worked for ? ”
131676	131696	131697	131697	Paul	379	“ Party Planners Plus . My girlfriend is the owner and I recently joined on board as her partner . ”
131705	131711	131712	131712	He	379	“ Here she is now . ”
131720	131739	131712	131712	He	379	“ Julia , this is Celia Werner . You remember when we did that event for Madge Werner . ”
131745	131756	131740	131740	Julia	293	“ Totally . It was at the MoMA last spring . ”
131757	131782	131740	131740	Julia	293	“ Ah , that was you ? How nice to meet you . It turned out lovely , no matter what my mother said . ”
131870	131890	131891	131891	Julia	293	“ I hope you do n’t mind , but as Paul said , we ’ve got to be running . ”
131895	131904	131891	131891	Julia	293	“ It was so awesome to meet you . ”
131925	131944	131921	131921	Julia	293	“ You , too . I ’ll draw up those packages and get back to you by tomorrow . ”
131945	131948	131905	131905	I	884	“ Perfect ! ”
131967	131989	131960	131960	Julia	293	“ Yes , we look forward to working with you . A joint venture would be beneficial to both of us . ”
132012	132018	132019	132019	I	884	“ I certainly hope so , ”
132058	132067	132030	132030	I	884	“ What in the hell was that about ? ”
132112	132115	132116	132116	Celia	9246	“ Laynie ? ”
132126	132137	132116	132116	Celia	9246	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ”
132138	132148	132116	132116	Celia	9246	“ You could cut the tension with a knife . ”
132162	132168	132149	132149	I	884	“ Was it that obvious ? ”
132169	132180	132116	132116	Celia	9246	“ Yeah . It was . Wanna talk about it ? ”
132187	132194	132195	132195	Her	9246	“ Ooh , there ’s hesitation . ”
132204	132218	132195	132195	Her	9246	“ Let ’s talk about it . But not here . Over coffee . ”
132236	132240	132219	132219	I	884	“ All right . ”
132278	132305	132219	132219	I	884	“ Great ! I ’m sure you need to lock up . I ’ll head to the coffee shop next door and get us a table . ”
132428	132435	132474	132474	Her	9246	“ So who was the guy ? ”
132445	132452	132436	132436	I	884	“ No one . A client . ”
132453	132473	132436	132436	I	884	“ That ’s a lie and you know it . There was all that weird vibe stuff going on . ”
132605	132634	132596	132596	Celia	9246	“ I mean , I get it . He ’s yummy , as in I would n’t mind having him in my bed for a night or twelve . ”
132638	132652	132635	132635	I	884	“ Good luck with that . His business partner is also his girlfriend . ”
132667	132679	132635	132635	I	884	“ On second thought , you probably still have a chance . ”
132680	132687	132691	132691	Sherlock	299	“ Obviously you speak from experience . ”
132761	132771	132772	132772	Celia	9246	“ Tell me . You know you want to . ”
132825	132828	132829	132829	she	9246	“ Damn , ”
132833	132836	132829	132829	she	9246	“ Right ? ”
132837	132851	132852	132852	She	9246	“ Like , ugh . I do n’t even know what to say . ”
132866	132871	132852	132852	She	9246	“ Does Hudson know ? ”
132872	132893	132852	132852	She	9246	“ He knows about the restraining order , of course . He told you about that , did n’t he ? ”
132897	132904	132894	132894	She	9246	“ He mentioned something about it . ”
132988	133023	132979	132979	I	884	“ But he does n’t know I met with Paul today . I did n’t know I was meeting with him until he showed up . Now I do n’t know what to do . ”
133041	133084	133024	133024	I	884	“ The obvious answer is to not work with him . That ’s what I have to do . And Paul can say whatever he wants , but I ca n’t put myself and The Sky Launch in that kind of jeopardy . ”
133085	133096	133097	133097	Celia	9246	“ There you go ! You got it worked out . ”
133107	133110	133097	133097	Celia	9246	“ Except … ”
133117	133119	133113	133119	a whole bunch of “ excepts ”	9035	“ excepts ”
133182	133184	133180	133180	Celia	9246	“ except ”
133187	133191	133177	133177	I	884	“ Except what ? ”
133192	133240	133241	133241	She	9246	“ Party Planners Plus is getting a really good name around town . It ’s impossible to please my mother and she was almost happy with what they did at the MoMA . That ’s saying a lot . They ’d do great things for the club . ”
133250	133257	133241	133241	She	9246	“ And Hudson would be proud . ”
133258	133265	133177	133177	I	884	“ Are you reading my mind ? ”
133269	133276	133266	133266	She	9246	“ I ’m just thinking logically . ”
133290	133302	133277	133277	She	9246	“ Would you have to work with Paul hands - on ? ”
133303	133315	133266	133266	She	9246	“ No , I think I could go strictly through Julia . ”
133316	133330	133277	133277	She	9246	“ You could make that a stipulation to signing a contract with them . ”
133331	133342	133343	133343	I	884	“ But Hudson would freak ! My brother would freak ! ”
133359	133385	133350	133350	I	884	“ Not that I ’m speaking to my brother , but he worked his ass off to get me out of the whole Paul debacle . ”
133393	133406	133386	133386	Celia	9246	“ Do n’t tell him . Do n’t tell either of them . ”
133407	133421	133386	133386	Celia	9246	“ How can I hide Paul from Hudson ? He owns the club ! ”
133422	133476	133386	133386	Celia	9246	“ Your contact is going to be with the girlfriend , right ? If Hudson happens to see the paperwork — which is unlikely — it will say Party Planners Plus . If I remember correctly , Paul ’s not even really an owner . It ’s legally all in Julia ’s name . ”
133477	133486	133487	133487	I	884	“ Right , right . That ’s right . ”
133500	133514	133491	133491	Celia	9246	“ But since that ’s the case , maybe I should tell Hudson . ”
133515	133570	133386	133386	Celia	9246	“ You can tell him , but if I know Hudson — and I do — there ’s no way he ’ll let you keep that contract . He ’s too protective of things he considers his . And in this case , that ’s not only The Sky Launch , it ’s you . ”
133605	133616	133491	133491	Celia	9246	“ I know . It was worth a shot though . ”
133617	133632	133386	133386	Celia	9246	“ So you have two options : forget the contract or forget telling Hudson . ”
133673	133694	133665	133665	Paul	379	“ I wo n’t tell him . I ’ll work with Party Planners and Hudson will never be the wiser . ”
133695	133704	133705	133705	She	2362	“ Then I wo n’t tell him either . ”
133716	133720	133705	133705	She	2362	“ Pinky swear . ”
133751	133765	133721	133721	Her	2362	“ Thank you . Talking to you really helps me figure things out . ”
133766	133772	133773	133773	She	2362	“ Of course it does . ”
133791	133804	133773	133773	She	2362	“ Hey , why did n’t you call me this morning anyway ? ”
133846	133872	133840	133840	I	884	“ I did n’t think it was a good idea to see you . Hudson was n’t happy when he found out we chatted yesterday . ”
133873	133882	133883	133883	She	2362	“ Hmm . I imagine he did n’t . ”
133905	133912	133913	133913	she	2362	“ Well , tell you what , ”
133919	133961	133913	133913	she	2362	“ We do n’t have to tell him about this either . I did n’t tell Jordan I was going to go find you so I ’m sure he would n’t say anything . You could just not say anything either . ”
133973	133988	133966	133966	my	884	“ I ’m not sure if I ’m good with keeping it from him . ”
134047	134106	134107	134107	She	9246	“ Sure , I get that . I ’m not trying to encourage keeping secrets or anything , but he ’s so weird where you ’re concerned . Protective or something . The last time I talked to you , he was pissed for days . He thinks I ’m going to turn you against him or something . ”
134112	134132	134107	134107	She	9246	“ But it ’s up to you . Just let me know so I ’m on the same page . ”
134133	134136	134138	134138	I	884	“ Okay . ”
134171	134174	134184	134184	my	884	“ Precious . ”
134274	134277	134278	134278	I	884	“ Hey , ”
134284	134291	134278	134278	I	884	“ I ’m glad you called . ”
134292	134299	134278	134278	I	884	“ I said that I would . ”
134322	134337	134308	134308	they	2364	“ I ’m glad both that you said you would and that you did . ”
134338	134344	134348	134348	his	2366	“ You are easily pleased . ”
134356	134363	134348	134348	his	2366	“ How has your day been ? ”
134364	134371	134373	134373	Celia	9246	“ Dreadful until this very moment . ”
134417	134426	134442	134442	His	2366	“ Oh ? Why ? What ’s wrong ? ”
134467	134485	134455	134455	I	884	“ Nothing . Nothing ’s wrong . Just everything is dreadful in comparison to being with you . ”
134486	134492	134533	134533	his	2366	“ I feel the same . ”
134506	134522	134497	134497	Hudson	1556	“ You do n’t know what that does to me to hear you say that . ”
134523	134528	134533	134533	his	2366	“ I can imagine . ”
134549	134556	134557	134557	His	2366	“ How did your meetings go ? ”
134607	134640	134592	134592	I	884	“ I ’ve only met with one company so far . And it went well . I have to follow up , but I ’m pretty sure it ’s a done deal . ”
134641	134656	134674	134675	Paul Kresh	379	“ Of course it is . Who would n’t want to work with you ? ”
134657	134664	134592	134592	I	884	“ Should I make a list ? ”
134683	134700	134704	134704	he	2366	“ Yes , do . And I ’ll have each and every one of them shot . ”
134717	134726	134704	134704	he	2366	“ Do you have any plans this evening ? ”
134750	134764	134765	134765	I	884	“ I had planned to be adored by a hot , virile man . ”
134780	134795	134765	134765	I	884	“ But I could cancel with him if you have something better in mind . ”
134796	134801	134765	134765	I	884	“ You ’re teasing . ”
134802	134806	134765	134765	I	884	“ Am I ? ”
134807	134818	134819	134819	His	2366	“ You are , and I do n’t like it . ”
134828	134853	134819	134819	His	2366	“ Some people I know are holding an event at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and I ’d like to be there . With you . ”
134854	134864	134765	134765	I	884	“ I ’m all yours , H. Every time . ”
134865	134879	134819	134819	His	2366	“ Good . I ’ll pick you up at the club around six . ”
134920	134936	134880	134880	I	884	“ No , pick me up at my apartment . I need to change first . ”
134937	134945	134880	134880	I	884	“ What you ’re wearing is perfect . ”
134946	134956	134957	134957	I	884	“ How do you know what I ’m wearing ? ”
134976	134988	134989	134989	I	884	“ Do you have security cameras in the club or something ? ”
135014	135037	134995	134995	him	2368	“ Of course I have cameras . But I do n’t monitor their feed . Jordan told me what you were wearing . ”
135038	135045	135009	135009	my	884	“ Ah , yes , Jordan . ”
135113	135125	135092	135092	I	884	“ Tell me — is Jordan more than just my driver ? ”
135126	135139	135140	135140	Hudson	1556	“ You did n’t want a bodyguard . I had to compromise . ”
135157	135166	135140	135140	Hudson	1556	“ So Jordan spies on me for you ? ”
135167	135196	135140	135140	Hudson	1556	“ Spy is not an accurate description of what he does . He drives you places , makes sure you ’re safe , and reports back to me . ”
135240	135254	135232	135232	I	884	“ I heard that sigh . Tell me what bothers you about this ? ”
135255	135282	135232	135232	I	884	“ Nothing , really . Only I would n’t have come on to Jordan so unmistakably if I ’d known he was reporting back to you . ”
135301	135310	135311	135311	he	655	“ We both know that did n’t happen , ”
135314	135331	135311	135311	he	655	“ That ’s twice you ’ve tried to rile me . What exactly is your motive ? ”
135332	135349	135232	135232	I	884	“ No motive . It ’s just fun to hear you get all possessive alpha male . ”
135350	135363	135311	135311	he	655	“ If you want possessive alpha male , I can certainly comply . ”
135373	135406	135364	135364	I	884	“ I want you to be you . Which is already really possessive alpha male , but if there ’s more of that you ’re keeping from me , bring it on . ”
135407	135423	135232	135232	I	884	“ I changed my mind . I ’ll pick you up at five - thirty . ”
135424	135431	135364	135364	I	884	“ Okay . Extra stop planned ? ”
135432	135454	135232	135232	I	884	“ No . I need time to fuck you on the way over in the limo without worrying about being rushed . ”
135472	135480	135465	135465	I	884	“ You need to mark your territory ? ”
135481	135503	135232	135232	I	884	“ I need to be inside you . Otherwise , I ’ll be uncomfortably hard and unable to concentrate on business . ”
135518	135529	135504	135504	I	884	“ Then I shall be waiting at five - thirty . ”
135530	135536	135465	135465	I	884	“ Be ready for me . ”
135537	135542	135543	135543	I	884	“ I will be . ”
135563	135574	135465	135465	I	884	“ I should be done with my appointments by five . ”
135575	135589	135465	135465	I	884	“ When I said ready , I meant that I want you wet . ”
135590	135605	135465	135465	I	884	“ Oh . Well , I ’m sure that wo n’t be a problem . ”
135623	135642	135465	135465	I	884	“ But maybe you can send me some dirty texts on your way to help heighten the mood . ”
135643	135652	135465	135465	I	884	“ I ’m sure that could be arranged . ”
135653	135656	135465	135465	I	884	“ Awesome . ”
135710	135723	135729	135729	David	180	“ I ’m craving the taste of your pussy on my lips . ”
135724	135728	135729	135729	David	180	“ Everything okay ? ”
135750	135761	135729	135729	David	180	“ Yeah . I ’m fine . I’m … just … ”
135774	135799	135729	135729	David	180	“ I ’ve been thinking about it all day . Your pussy . How it feels , how it tastes , how it smells . ”
135805	135820	135729	135729	David	180	“ And the sounds you make when I ’m touching you and eating you . ”
135826	135835	135836	135836	I	884	“ Uh , Hudson ’s on his way , ”
135839	135850	135836	135836	I	884	“ I did n’t realize it was already so late . ”
135851	135867	135729	135729	David	180	“ Then better get wrapped up . Do n’t want to leave the boss waiting . ”
135892	135898	135881	135881	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m already wet . ”
135931	135945	135925	135925	his	180	“ I ’m hard for you , too . So hard it hurts . ”
135970	135983	135953	135953	he	180	“ What will you do to me when you ’re with me ? ”
136012	136027	136007	136007	he	180	“ First I ’ll spank you for teasing me with talk of other men . ”
136028	136031	136007	136007	he	180	“ Then ? ”
136032	136039	136007	136007	he	180	“ Come outside and find out . ”
136040	136049	136007	136007	he	180	“ You ’re here ? You came early . ”
136074	136082	136083	136083	I	884	“ Have a good night , David , ”
136107	136126	136127	136127	His	180	“ No . I ’m fucking hard as stone for you , but I wo n’t come early . ”
136139	136144	136127	136127	His	180	“ Get out here . ”
136170	136173	136157	136157	I	884	“ Coming . ”
136192	136199	136174	136174	I	884	“ Yes . You will be . ”
136239	136243	136230	136230	I	884	“ Fancy ride . ”
136316	136325	136326	136326	I	884	“ Well , hello to you , too , ”
136352	136380	136332	136332	He	655	“ The fancy ride is merely for privacy . No one should witness the things I intend to do to you on the way to our event . ”
136392	136405	136389	136389	I	884	“ And what , pray tell , do you intend to do ? ”
136406	136411	136412	136412	His	655	“ First , this . ”
136465	136478	136479	136479	he	655	“ One for each time you teased me about other men today , ”
136616	136628	136613	136613	I	884	“ Thank you , sir . Thank you for the spanking . ”
136632	136642	136629	136629	Hudson	1556	“ Do you need another one for mocking me ? ”
136663	136681	136656	136656	I	884	“ I ’m not mocking , sir . I enjoy my punishment , if it pleases you . ”
136682	136694	136650	136650	he	168	“ Oh , we ’re playing that game , are we ? ”
136702	136714	136715	136715	He	168	“ In that case , another one because it pleases me . ”
136734	136745	136728	136728	I	884	“ And another for the secret you ’ve been keeping . ”
136780	136788	136774	136774	he	168	“ What secret is that , sir ? ”
136789	136806	136826	136826	His	168	“ That you enjoy being spanked . I can smell how wet you are from here . ”
136817	136825	136815	136815	me	884	“ Yes , sir . I do . ”
136843	136854	136826	136826	His	168	“ Yes , you certainly do . You ’re dripping . ”
136891	136910	136878	136878	he	168	“ I insist you buckle up while we ’re driving . I have to protect what ’s mine . ”
137024	137042	137018	137018	I	884	“ But sir , how can I ever please you when I ’m held to one spot ? ”
137043	137050	137051	137051	His	676	“ Are you challenging my decision ? ”
137059	137072	137051	137051	His	676	“ Because I ’m not above putting you back over my knee . ”
137073	137083	137084	137084	He	676	“ I ’m sure you ’re not . Sir . ”
137121	137128	137116	137116	Hudson	1556	“ Jordan , we ’re ready . ”
137147	137161	137136	137136	Hudson	1556	“ Turn in your seat as much as you can to face me . ”
137302	137307	137291	137291	He	676	“ Eyes on me . ”
137358	137362	137363	137363	His	676	“ Good girl . ”
137372	137398	137363	137363	His	676	“ That kiss was to set the tone . Now you will suck me off . And I want it to feel like that kiss . ”
137399	137407	137408	137408	God	8844	“ Okay . Now as in now ? ”
137416	137421	137363	137363	His	676	“ Yes , now . ”
137551	137567	137542	137542	His	676	“ Like that , Alayna . Just … oh , god … just like that . ”
137608	137618	137619	137619	He	676	“ Yes , Alayna . You feel so good . ”
137668	137673	137678	137678	he	676	“ Christ … Alayna … ”
137821	137824	137825	137825	he	676	“ Fuck ! ”
137828	137844	137825	137825	he	676	“ I ’m going to come . Take it , Alayna . Take it all . ”
138020	138024	138025	138025	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
138125	138128	138114	138114	He	676	“ Alayna . ”
138189	138199	138180	138180	His	676	“ How does it feel to belong to me ? ”
138228	138231	138225	138225	I	884	“ Perfect . ”
138327	138335	138336	138336	I	884	“ You seem awfully pleased with yourself , ”
138349	138356	138344	138344	He	676	“ Everyone knows who I am . ”
138357	138367	138336	138336	I	884	“ That ’s not what you seem pleased about . ”
138375	138396	138368	138368	He	676	“ I think I deserve to be pleased . A lot was accomplished within a relatively short amount of time . ”
138397	138418	138419	138419	I	884	“ If by a lot was accomplished you mean I can barely walk , then yes , you ’re correct . ”
138577	138585	138725	138725	I	884	“ What is this event for anyway ? ”
138586	138593	138594	138594	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s sponsored by CotF , ”
138597	138626	138594	138594	Hudson	1556	“ Children of the Future . They ’re a foundation that provides resources for foster children . This event is a thank you for those who have donated . ”
138627	138635	138725	138725	I	884	“ And how much have you donated ? ”
138646	138653	138594	138594	Hudson	1556	“ Not how much , what . ”
138660	138666	138594	138594	Hudson	1556	“ I donated a school . ”
138679	138724	138676	138676	he	676	“ And several scholarships on top of that . I came tonight to meet the new principal . I want the foundation ’s Board of Directors to realize that though I ’m not hands - on with their program , I ’m still around . ”
138941	138945	138946	138946	Hudson	1556	“ One moment . ”
138966	138975	138963	138963	he	2410	“ Alayna , you ’re welcome to stay . ”
139012	139028	139029	139029	I	884	“ Thank you , but I want to catch the sights before the sun sets . ”
139034	139040	139029	139029	I	884	“ Unless you need me — ”
139041	139044	139053	139053	his	676	“ No . ”
139077	139129	139053	139053	his	676	“ I simply want you to be comfortable . Let me introduce you before you leave . Alayna , this is Aaron Trent . Aaron , this is my girlfriend , Alayna Withers . Perhaps of more interest to you , she ’s also my promotions manager at The Sky Launch . ”
139152	139158	139159	139159	His	442	“ Nice to meet you . ”
139176	139192	139164	139164	he	442	“ The Sky Launch ? I ’d heard you were giving the place a makeover . ”
139193	139201	139233	139233	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m not . Alayna is . ”
139202	139205	139206	139206	Aaron	442	“ Great , ”
139216	139232	139206	139206	Aaron	442	“ I ’d love to chat sometime about what my team could do for you . ”
139238	139278	139233	139233	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ’s your woman . I ’m sure she ’d be happy to meet with you . Alayna , Aaron owns an advertising firm . His company is quite excellent . We ’ve used his services many times . ”
139297	139312	139313	139313	They	2412	“ Ah , Trent Advertising . I did n’t realize you were that Trent . ”
139359	139364	139354	139354	Aaron	442	“ Ms. , uh … ”
139365	139368	139369	139369	Hudson	1556	“ Withers , ”
139375	139391	139354	139354	Aaron	442	“ Yes , Ms. Withers . Sorry , I ’ve never been good with names . ”
139420	139442	139410	139410	I	884	“ Mr. Trent , I ’d love to meet with you . Should I call your office to set something up ? ”
139443	139472	139483	139483	I	884	“ I ’d love to stop by the club when it ’s open , check things out so I can come up with some ideas for a campaign . ”
139473	139479	139480	139480	Hudson	1556	“ How about tomorrow evening ? ”
139542	139545	139539	139540	Hudson Pierce	1556	“ Sure . ”
139546	139575	139520	139520	Aaron	442	“ We open at nine , but if you can come by around , say eight - thirty , we could talk a bit before it gets crazy . ”
139772	139778	139805	139805	I	884	“ The deal closed Monday ? ”
139784	139804	139805	139805	I	884	“ Unfucking believable . You ’re a lucky son - of - a - bitch , you know that ? ”
139840	139860	139863	139865	the older guy	738	“ … Plexis was n’t something he wanted to let go . Had to fight him tooth and nail . ”
139891	139906	139907	139908	This guy	738	“ Fortunately , the rest of the board was not on Pierce ’s side . ”
139922	139930	139931	139933	the younger guy	738	“ So what are your plans now ? ”
139939	139964	139931	139933	the younger guy	738	“ With Plexis ? Well , there ’s a lot of money in it if we break it up and sell off the pieces . ”
139998	140013	140014	140016	The older man	738	“ But we ’re not discounting the idea of reselling it as a whole . ”
140025	140033	140014	140016	The older man	738	“ If we had a good offer . ”
140034	140044	140045	140047	Navy suit guy	738	“ Oh , are you expecting me to offer ? ”
140053	140082	140045	140047	Navy suit guy	738	“ Do n’t get me wrong , I ’d love to get my hands on Plexis , but I do n’t have that sort of money right now . ”
140083	140098	140045	140047	Navy suit guy	738	“ Just thought I ’d put the bug in your ear . In case . ”
140272	140275	140253	140253	He	738	“ Alayna . ”
140314	140335	140293	140293	Hudson	1556	“ Please meet my girlfriend , Alayna Withers . She ’s running the promotional division of one of my nightclubs . ”
140346	140352	140353	140353	Her	1124	“ Hi . Norma Anders . ”
140361	140373	140353	140353	Her	1124	“ I had n’t realized you were seeing anyone , Hudson . ”
140374	140386	140387	140387	Hudson	1556	“ We ’ve been private . Her wishes , not mine . ”
140393	140405	140387	140387	Hudson	1556	“ But I ’ve finally convinced her we should tell everyone . ”
140420	140466	140411	140411	her	10443	“ Congratulations , then . Honestly , I ’m glad you ’re done with the Werner girl . She was entirely too bubbly for you , if you ask me . Plus , I never trusted her . She was up to something , Hudson . ”
140545	140560	140517	140517	Hudson	1556	“ It was nice to see you here tonight , Norma . Those reports — ”
140572	140582	140561	140561	She	10443	“ I ’ll get them to you on Monday . ”
140583	140589	140561	140561	She	10443	“ Thank you , Norma . ”
140621	140632	140633	140633	Hudson	1556	“ First name basis , huh ? That’s … different . ”
140654	140673	140647	140647	He	2430	“ We ’ve known each other for years . First name basis becomes inevitable after so much time . ”
140674	140684	140691	140691	Hudson	1556	“ Why does she think you were seeing Celia ? ”
140713	140733	140691	140691	Hudson	1556	“ Celia often accompanied me to charity events and functions where Norma saw me socially . You know that . ”
140785	140804	140778	140778	His	2430	“ Norma must have assumed we were a couple . It never occurred to me to correct her . ”
140810	140822	140805	140805	My	884	“ Because you liked that people thought you were with Celia . ”
140823	140836	140778	140778	His	2430	“ Because I liked that Norma thought I was off - limits . ”
140837	140840	140805	140805	My	884	“ Oh . ”
140875	140887	140872	140872	he	2430	“ Norma manages the financial division of one of my companies . ”
140888	140896	140897	140897	I	884	“ Then you ’re co - workers . ”
140934	140948	140926	140926	His	2430	“ Why , Alayna , this shade of jealousy is becoming on you . ”
140954	140962	140949	140949	I	884	“ That ’s not a comforting response . ”
140963	140973	140926	140926	His	2430	“ Not co - workers . Boss and employee . ”
140999	141006	140990	140990	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s a familiar scenario . ”
141025	141046	141007	141007	He	2430	“ I ’ve never been your boss , Alayna . If anything , you ’re the one who owns me . ”
141116	141131	141111	141111	Hudson	1556	“ Have you seen pictures of the cherry blossoms when they ’re in bloom ? ”
141132	141135	141136	141136	I	884	“ No . ”
141157	141176	141177	141177	He	884	“ It ’s breathtaking . All the trees filled with pink popcorn . The fragrance is absolutely incredible . ”
141185	141194	141177	141177	He	884	“ We ’ll come here in the spring . ”
141195	141200	141201	141201	I	884	“ That sounds lovely . ”
141297	141313	141276	141276	I	884	“ Hey , I have something to tell you that you might be interested in . ”
141332	141341	141342	141342	I	884	“ It does n’t have to be now , ”
141360	141368	141342	141342	I	884	“ You can finish your mingling first . ”
141377	141394	141369	141369	His	884	“ The only mingling that interests me at the moment is the mingling of our genitalia . ”
141395	141407	141409	141409	his	884	“ You ’re insatiable . You had me in the car . ”
141421	141427	141428	141428	He	884	“ It was n’t enough . ”
141466	141475	141459	141459	his	884	“ I can never have enough of you . ”
141543	141548	141535	141535	I	884	“ I love you . ”
141562	141582	141549	141549	He	1097	“ Is that what you pulled me away to tell me ? I ’m not complaining if it is . ”
141586	141623	141583	141583	I	884	“ You pulled me away , not the other way around , silly . And it ’s not what I had to tell you . But I ’m glad every time I get to say it . ”
141665	141681	141655	141661	the salt - and - pepper man	2042	“ Actually , you picked the perfect location . You see that man over there ? ”
141687	141694	141682	141682	Hudson	1556	“ The one in the tan ? ”
141695	141702	141703	141703	I	884	“ The man next to him . ”
141717	141723	141703	141703	I	884	“ Do you know him ? ”
141724	141733	141682	141682	Hudson	1556	“ Not that I recall . Should I ? ”
141737	141750	141734	141734	I	884	“ Not necessarily . But I overheard him talking with another guy — ”
141763	141798	141734	141734	I	884	“ — that I ca n’t see right now . Anyway , not important . The salt - and - pepper man works for the company that purchased — wait for it — Plexis . ”
141817	141824	141799	141799	Hudson	1556	“ How do you know this ? ”
141825	141857	141799	141799	Hudson	1556	“ I heard him . When I was wandering earlier . He was boasting about how he was lucky to snatch such an amazing company from the likes of Hudson Pierce . ”
141863	141867	141858	141858	Hudson	1556	“ Go on . ”
141873	141886	141868	141868	I	884	“ You were right . They ’re planning to dismantle the company . ”
141887	141891	141897	141897	Hudson	1556	“ Damn it . ”
141946	141965	141966	141966	I	884	“ But he mentioned that they might be interested in selling if they got a good offer first . ”
141978	142001	141966	141966	I	884	“ You know what that means ? It means all you need to do is get in there with a good offer . ”
142019	142031	142006	142006	he	2042	“ How about I get in you with a good offer ? ”
142032	142035	142036	142036	I	884	“ Hudson ! ”
142043	142048	142036	142036	I	884	“ I ’m serious . ”
142049	142053	142054	142054	He	2042	“ So am I. ”
142092	142101	142085	142085	my	884	“ I thought Plexis meant something to you . ”
142102	142106	142107	142107	He	2042	“ It does . ”
142129	142151	142117	142117	I	884	“ Then how come all you can think about is sexing me up ? Is that all I am to you ? ”
142209	142272	142194	142194	he	2042	“ No , it ’s not . You know that your business mind turns me on to no end , especially when your business mind is looking out for my interests . And because I ’m not skilled at expressing how I feel in words , I ’m wishing I could show you exactly how into you I am at the moment . ”
142295	142304	142286	142286	my	884	“ So you ’re grateful for the information ? ”
142305	142308	142309	142309	He	2042	“ Very . ”
142341	142352	142353	142353	My	884	“ And you ’re attracted to me beyond the physical ? ”
142380	142409	142370	142370	he	2042	“ I ’m attracted to everything about you — your body , your mind , your sass . Even your ‘ crazy , ’ as you call it . ”
142410	142426	142370	142370	he	2042	“ You ’re crazy , too , if you ’re serious about that last one . ”
142441	142494	142427	142427	His	2042	“ I ’ve never been more serious , Alayna . You ’re the first person I ’ve ever met who makes me believe I might not be crazy . It ’s the best thing that ’s ever happened to me . You ’re the best thing that ’s ever happened to me . ”
142529	142553	142512	142512	Hudson	1556	“ You need to rethink that whole I’m - not - good - with - words angle , because those words were perfect . ”
142563	142577	142554	142554	His	2042	“ Now stop talking and let me occupy your mouth in other ways . ”
142578	142588	142589	142589	I	884	“ What happened to that good offer you had ? ”
142611	142618	142619	142619	His	2042	“ Patience , precious . Patience . ”
142714	142721	142722	142722	I	884	“ Excuse me . Excuse me . ”
142736	142740	142722	142722	I	884	“ Excuse me ! ”
142755	142769	142770	142771	The woman	1124	“ Excuse me , but the lawn is off limits except for in — ”
142777	142791	142770	142771	The woman	1124	“ Oh , Mr. Pierce . I did n’t realize that … Alayna ? ”
142803	142810	142797	142797	I	884	“ Julia ? What are you — ”
142824	142832	142811	142811	Julia	293	“ Is your company in charge tonight ? ”
142833	142836	142815	142815	she	1124	“ Yeah . ”
142889	142898	142886	142886	I	884	“ Ha , wow . What a coincidence . ”
142917	142940	142912	142912	I	884	“ Hudson , this is Julia Swaggert . She ’s the owner of Party Planners Plus . I met with her today . ”
142967	142975	142949	142950	Paul Kresh	379	“ Julia , this is Hudson Pierce . ”
142985	143012	142981	142981	Julia	293	“ I’m … Mr. Pierce , it ’s an honor to meet you . I ’m really excited about the potential our companies have working together . ”
143059	143087	143088	143088	He	379	“ You ’re in good hands with Alayna . She takes care of all business with the club . I ’m merely a name on the deed . ”
143094	143111	143088	143088	He	379	“ If you ’ll both pardon me , I see someone I need to speak with . ”
143202	143209	143210	143210	She	293	“ So you and Hudson Pierce ? ”
143215	143231	143210	143210	She	293	“ Is it simply a getting frisky in the moonlight thing or the whole enchilada ? ”
143232	143253	143210	143210	She	293	“ It ’s , well , both . We ’re together , if that ’s what the whole enchilada means . ”
143272	143283	143265	143265	I	884	“ Speaking of ‘ together , ’ where ’s Paul ? ”
143289	143305	143284	143284	She	293	“ He ’s about somewhere . He usually stays behind the scenes at these things . ”
143306	143312	143313	143313	He	379	“ Ah , of course . ”
143327	143342	143313	143313	He	379	“ Well , I think Hudson was about ready to call it a night — ”
143343	143355	143356	143356	Her	293	“ Yeah , it certainly appeared as such . Lucky you . ”
143411	143421	143422	143422	she	293	“ Well , I should get back as well , ”
143450	143462	143440	143440	I	884	“ Nice to see you at work ! You ’re good . ”
143463	143466	143478	143479	Paul Kresh	379	“ Thanks . ”
143535	143543	143544	143544	His	379	“ We need to leave . Now . ”
143589	143597	143585	143585	I	884	“ Why ? What ’s the problem ? ”
143625	143630	143631	143631	I	884	“ Oh , my . ”
143687	143698	143668	143668	I	884	“ Or you could take me here in the gardens . ”
143699	143737	143738	143738	His	379	“ Do n’t tempt me . I ’m near throwing you on that bench over there , but that might not be in the best of taste . And I would n’t want to tarnish your reputation . ”
143744	143779	143738	143738	His	379	“ Besides , what I have in store for you will take most of the night and I ’m sure the Brooklyn Botanic Society would prefer to close before I ’m anywhere near finished . ”
143789	143794	143782	143782	I	884	“ Um , okay . ”
143795	143801	143738	143738	His	379	“ Is that a problem ? ”
143802	143807	143782	143782	I	884	“ Not at all . ”
143819	143824	143738	143738	His	379	“ What is it ? ”
143825	143838	143738	143738	His	379	“ I see someone I should talk to . Do you mind ? ”
143866	143882	143860	143860	Hudson	1556	“ Considering how you ’re walking , I think you ’ll be the miserable one . ”
143995	144018	143988	143988	Our	2462	“ Hudson , I ’ll let you talk with your peeps . I ’m going to look for the girl ’s room . ”
144024	144040	144041	144041	he	379	“ Maybe I ’ll have to come find you there when I ’m done here , ”
144146	144159	144131	144131	He	379	“ Should I be worried that you ’re stalking me ? Again ? ”
144165	144171	144172	144172	He	379	“ Do n’t bother explaining . ”
144181	144204	144172	144172	He	379	“ That was Hudson Pierce , was n’t it ? If you ’re with him , I get why you ’re here . ”
144231	144244	144223	144223	Julia	293	“ Yes , that ’s Hudson . We ’re seeing each other . ”
144245	144248	144258	144258	I	884	“ Huh . ”
144276	144311	144223	144223	Julia	293	“ Hey , there ’s nothing to gain from this information , Paul . He knows about you and my past , knows about the restraining order , and if you have any intention — ”
144312	144347	144378	144378	He	379	“ What the fuck intention would I have ? You ’re acting like I ’d blackmail you or something . Which is pretty ballsy coming from someone who handcuffed herself to my desk naked . ”
144348	144368	144223	144223	Julia	293	“ I ’d say it ’s a damn fair assumption since you pretty much blackmailed me just this afternoon . ”
144369	144377	144378	144378	He	379	“ That … wasn’t blackmail . Exactly . ”
144390	144398	144378	144378	He	379	“ It was heavy - handed persuasion . ”
144399	144415	144223	144223	Julia	293	“ Whatever it was , it was pressure , and I did n’t like it . ”
144416	144421	144378	144378	He	379	“ Look , Laynie — ”
144422	144429	144430	144430	I	884	“ I know , I know . ”
144456	144545	144451	144451	I	884	“ You want this deal for Julia , and because I really want to work with her , I ’m agreeing to it . But I do n’t want any interaction with you . Zip . Nada . I do n’t want to bump into you at events or have you showing up at my club or calling me — none of it . I want the restraining order restrictions to be adhered to . This ca n’t come back to bite me in the ass , okay ? ”
144546	144551	144557	144557	his	379	“ Fine . Whatever . ”
144560	144579	144557	144557	his	379	“ It wo n’t come back to bite you . It ’s only me and you this affects . ”
144580	144606	144609	144609	I	884	“ Tell that to Hudson . He would not like it if he found out that I signed a deal that even remotely involved you . ”
144669	144700	144647	144647	she	9246	“ Why would he care ? As long as we keep it professional and at a distance like you said , this does n’t have anything to do with him . ”
144701	144721	144746	144746	Paul	379	“ Because , while you and I both know that most everything that happened between us was my fault — ”
144722	144729	144647	144647	she	9246	“ Most everything ? Try everything . ”
144737	144745	144730	144730	I	884	“ You did cheat on your fiancé . ”
144753	144782	144783	144783	I	884	“ Anyway , Hudson does n’t see you as innocent . And it ’s not because I said anything to point you out , it ’s simply because … ”
144797	144814	144790	144790	I	884	“ I do n’t know why . He sees the good in me for some reason . ”
144827	144841	144824	144824	Paul	379	“ I did n’t know from his reputation that he was a psycho . ”
144853	144915	144842	144842	I	884	“ You know what ? You need to shut the fuck up . He is not a psycho . I am not a psycho . You , however , are an asshole . I can still back out of this shit . Go ahead and throw whatever you want to throw at me , I have Hudson Pierce on my side . ”
144916	144962	144982	144982	He	884	“ And would n’t he love it if the whole world knew about his girlfriend ’s criminal past ? He ’d be a laughing stock . Especially when I tell everyone how you sought out Party Planners Plus so you could work with me again . ”
144974	144981	144967	144967	I	884	“ But that ’s not true . ”
144996	145018	144982	144982	He	884	“ People do n’t care if it ’s true . They love gossip , particularly when it ’s about the elite . ”
145024	145032	145019	145019	My	884	“ I thought this was n’t blackmail . ”
145033	145041	145042	145042	He	884	“ Not yet , it is n’t . ”
145049	145056	145042	145042	He	884	“ Does it need to be ? ”
145085	145102	145104	145104	his	884	“ Fine , Paul . I ’ll do the deal but on the terms I listed . ”
145113	145127	145104	145104	his	884	“ I ’m walking away now . Smile and head the other direction . ”
145153	145156	145157	145157	I	884	“ Hey . ”
145169	145176	145157	145157	I	884	“ Did you find the restroom ? ”
145177	145182	145157	145157	I	884	“ Um , no . ”
145193	145206	145157	145157	I	884	“ It ’s okay . I can wait until we get home . ”
145245	145267	145230	145230	I	884	“ That was one of the event workers . I was trying to get the dirt on Party Planners from him . ”
145273	145283	145268	145268	He	379	“ It seemed to be a rather animated discussion . ”
145284	145296	145298	145298	I	884	“ Yeah , he was passionate about what he was saying . ”
145309	145340	145298	145298	I	884	“ I guess it got me riled up too . He says they ’re a great company all around . I ’m more excited than ever to work with them . ”
145424	145429	145430	145430	He	2470	“ That ’s excellent . ”
145437	145468	145430	145430	He	2470	“ Want to know what I ’m more excited than ever about ? Getting home . More specifically , getting you home . Or , at least to the car . ”
145469	145474	145476	145476	he	2470	“ Me , too . ”
145550	145556	145557	145557	he	2470	“ You start the shower , ”
145560	145567	145557	145557	he	2470	“ I ’ll start the coffee . ”
145688	145706	145707	145707	Hudson	1556	“ Well , the look on your face says you might not need me anymore for pleasure . ”
145734	145740	145741	145741	I	884	“ This shower is amazeballs , ”
145767	145770	145741	145741	I	884	“ Amazeballs ? ”
145771	145784	145785	145785	My	884	“ But it can never compare to what you do to me . ”
145815	145832	145806	145806	He	676	“ What if I did amazeballs things to you while we ’re in the amazeballs shower ? ”
145859	145873	145853	145853	him	676	“ There ’s not even a word for how amazeballs that would be . ”
145976	145979	145966	145967	the man	676	“ Hungry ? ”
145986	145992	145981	145981	he	676	“ Oh , for breakfast ? ”
145993	146023	145966	145967	the man	676	“ Yes , for breakfast . Get your mind out of the gutter , precious . I ’ve already spent more time than I allotted on you this morning . ”
146042	146055	146024	146024	I	884	“ Well , I ’m glad to know there was an allotment . ”
146056	146060	146061	146061	He	676	“ There was . ”
146078	146084	146070	146070	I	884	“ Toast and grapefruit okay ? ”
146085	146088	146089	146089	I	884	“ Perfect , ”
146097	146103	146089	146089	I	884	“ Meet you out there . ”
146271	146292	146293	146293	He	700	“ I did n’t know what time you were planning to be out of here so I gave you that . ”
146300	146356	146357	146357	I	884	“ Soon . I have an appointment at ten - thirty with a graphic designer to go over new menus , and I want to make sure I have my presentation for tonight ’s meeting with Aaron Trent ready before that , because I have a crap load of other things to do this afternoon . ”
146378	146385	146373	146373	Hudson	1556	“ A crap load of things ? ”
146386	146413	146414	146414	I	884	“ Yeah . I ’m sure Trent will want a formal marketing plan , and I need to set up some interviews for an additional cook . ”
146422	146430	146414	146414	I	884	“ And I really should go home . ”
146431	146434	146449	146449	his	2481	“ Home . ”
146459	146463	146414	146414	I	884	“ My apartment . ”
146464	146472	146414	146414	I	884	“ I understood the reference . Why ? ”
146482	146516	146473	146473	I	884	“ I do n’t know . I need to pick up my mail and check on things . Make sure the place is okay . You know , all my stuff is there . ”
146580	146599	146640	146640	I	884	“ I should get another change of clothes if you ’re inviting me to stay the night again . ”
146610	146639	146600	146600	Hudson	1556	“ Inviting you to stay the night ? What are you talking about ? I gave you a key . You can come and go as you please . ”
146651	146674	146640	146640	I	884	“ So , then I definitely need a change of clothes . Because it pleases me to spend the night with you . ”
146675	146690	146691	146691	He	2481	“ It pleases me for you to spend the night with me , too . ”
146705	146738	146691	146691	He	2481	“ And as long as we ’re talking about it , it would please me if you would spend all your nights here and if all your things were here as well . ”
146763	146777	146756	146756	I	884	“ What are you … I do n’t know what you ’re saying . ”
146778	146797	146798	146798	He	2481	“ Yes , you do . But I ’ll spell it out if that makes you feel better . ”
146861	146868	146869	146869	My	884	“ Yes , spell it out . ”
146881	146899	146869	146869	My	884	“ Why do you need your apartment ? Your lease is almost up . Move in here . ”
146957	146967	146968	146968	Hudson	1556	“ I love that I can still shock you . ”
146981	147007	146968	146968	Hudson	1556	“ But I ’d prefer that this was n’t one of the times that I did . What about that plan is shocking to you ? ”
147049	147063	147036	147036	I	884	“ Well , um , it ’s just , it ’s awfully soon . ”
147067	147099	147064	147064	He	2481	“ It is . It ’s unfortunate that a lengthy time span is regarded as such an important element to appropriate landmarks in relationships . It should n’t be a factor . ”
147100	147106	147107	147107	I	884	“ But should n’t it ? ”
147119	147168	147064	147064	He	2481	“ Not for me . As I said before , when I have a plan , I commit . I plan to be with you as much as possible . And not only in the carnal sense . Moving in is a logical way to make that happen . ”
147201	147240	147190	147190	he	2481	“ And that ’s another reason it might not be a good idea . It seems a little like a business plan . Like this is the next step on a list . Not very romantic or anything . ”
147245	147266	147241	147241	His	2481	“ I did n’t realize you were in need of romance . You know that ’s not in my nature . ”
147267	147270	147271	147271	I	884	“ Hey . ”
147286	147306	147271	147271	I	884	“ That ’s bullshit . You say you are n’t romantic , but you really are very much so . ”
147319	147329	147271	147271	I	884	“ I was n’t complaining about your romantic overtures . ”
147330	147338	147339	147339	He	2481	“ Then what are you complaining about ? ”
147344	147353	147271	147271	I	884	“ Nothing ! I ’m complaining about nothing . ”
147354	147370	147271	147271	I	884	“ You were complaining about the way I asked you to move in with me . ”
147371	147378	147379	147379	I	884	“ No , I ’m not . ”
147384	147405	147379	147379	I	884	“ Okay , yes , I was . A little , but that ’s not why I ’m saying no . ”
147411	147417	147408	147408	him	2481	“ You ’re saying no ? ”
147418	147421	147379	147379	I	884	“ No . ”
147424	147430	147379	147379	I	884	“ I mean , yes . ”
147475	147484	147470	147470	we	2484	“ I mean , I do n’t know . ”
147501	147513	147485	147485	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , do you know how you feel about me ? ”
147514	147525	147552	147552	He	2481	“ Yes . I love you . You know that . ”
147526	147533	147485	147485	Hudson	1556	“ Then move in with me . ”
147545	147551	147534	147534	I	884	“ I have to think . ”
147572	147575	147552	147552	He	2481	“ Why ? ”
147576	147581	147582	147582	I	884	“ I just do . ”
147637	147660	147622	147622	I	884	“ This is big , and yes , it would make things easier and I ca n’t deny that I want to — ”
147661	147666	147622	147622	I	884	“ Then do it . ”
147667	147683	147684	147684	I	884	“ — but I do n’t know if it ’s the right thing to do . ”
147710	147728	147702	147702	I	884	“ I ’m falling for you too hard , Hudson . Too fast and that scares me . ”
147729	147735	147752	147752	him	2481	“ Falling ? Or fallen ? ”
147784	147792	147775	147775	I	884	“ Either way , does it matter ? ”
147793	147829	147865	147874	a man who could n’t even say he loved me	2487	“ If you ’ve already fallen , then why are you worried anymore about whether it ’s too hard or too fast ? It ’s already done . That ’s how I ’m approaching it . ”
147888	147908	147876	147876	I	884	“ Can I just have a little time to think about it ? When I ’m away from you ? ”
147912	147922	147909	147909	He	2481	“ Are you suggesting that I ’m pressuring you ? ”
147923	147988	147876	147876	I	884	“ I ’m suggesting that you ’re distracting . And yes , it ’s pressure , whether you mean for it to be or not . And honestly , a tiny bit manipulative . And with your past , it does cross my mind that maybe you want to control me , and that this is the easiest way for you to do so . ”
148005	148053	147993	147993	I	884	“ Now , do n’t , do n’t be upset , H. I ’m not saying you are manipulating me or that you want to control me , I ’m saying I need time to think . To be sure . Give it to me . Please ? ”
148054	148062	148063	148063	His	2481	“ If that ’s what you need . ”
148095	148098	148081	148081	I	884	“ Hudson ! ”
148099	148102	148081	148081	I	884	“ What ? ”
148103	148110	148081	148081	I	884	“ Do n’t be like this . ”
148115	148123	148111	148111	He	2481	“ I ’m not being like anything . ”
148124	148130	148131	148131	I	884	“ Then are we okay ? ”
148167	148173	148157	148157	He	2481	“ Of course we are . ”
148182	148185	148174	148174	He	2481	“ Always . ”
148451	148460	148461	148461	She	1556	“ What do you know about Norma Anders ? ”
148492	148501	148487	148487	Celia	9246	“ Ah , you heard about the slut . ”
148502	148509	148510	148510	My	884	“ You mean , Hudson and — ”
148521	148597	148487	148487	Celia	9246	“ Honestly , I do n’t know for sure . It ’s not like Hudson discusses his conquests with me . And if I had to guess , I ’d say no because if he had fucked her — sorry , that was a bit coarse , but you know what I mean — if he had , then he ’d be done with her and she certainly would n’t still be working with him . ”
148634	148675	148631	148631	her	10443	“ That ’s if he slept with her when he was still , you know , messing with women . He has n’t done any of that for a while , right ? Like not in the last two years . ”
148680	148688	148676	148676	Her	10443	“ Uh , yeah . Of course . ”
148689	148720	148487	148487	Celia	9246	“ So Hudson could have slept with her after he ’d started therapy and then it would n’t have been such a big deal for him to keep her employed . ”
148724	148804	148721	148721	Celia	9246	“ I get you . But I still do n’t think so . Here ’s the thing . Norma ’s always been after him . From way before he ever had therapy . And I ca n’t tell you how many functions I went to where I watched her try to seduce him , hence the reason I refer to her as the slut . Yet despite all her attempts , he never made any move to play her . ”
148805	148827	148876	148876	Hudson	1556	“ Which makes it all more likely that he ’d go to her after therapy . Trust me , I know . ”
149057	149091	149047	149047	I	884	“ You ’re probably right . I do n’t know why I ’m worrying about it , really . I ’m the one he asked to move in with him , not her . ”
149092	149095	149096	149096	Her	10443	“ Exactly . ”
149100	149116	149096	149096	Her	10443	“ Wait , what ? He asked you to move in ? That ’s awesome ! ”
149159	149176	149145	149145	I	884	“ I do n’t know . It ’s too soon . Is n’t it too soon ? ”
149177	149187	149188	149188	Celia	9246	“ Whatever . Are there rules about these things ? ”
149196	149209	149188	149188	Celia	9246	“ When Hudson knows what he wants , he does n’t hesitate . ”
149224	149234	149235	149235	I	884	“ He told me pretty much the same thing . ”
149238	149245	149235	149235	I	884	“ When I told him no . ”
149246	149251	149252	149252	She	9246	“ You did n’t ! ”
149262	149276	149235	149235	I	884	“ I did . Well , I said I ’d think about it . ”
149282	149316	149277	149277	Celia	9246	“ And now you ’ve thought about it and you ’re going to say yes . You have to say yes . How can you not say yes ? This is Hudson Pierce ! ”
149317	149327	149330	149330	he	2500	“ I do n’t love him for that reason . ”
149358	149402	149403	149403	She	9246	“ All the more reason you have to say yes . And that ’s exactly why you ’re the one he wants . You are n’t caught up in the show that surrounds him . You ca n’t imagine how few people are . ”
149416	149449	149403	149403	She	9246	“ Jesus , Alayna , you ’re perfect for him . You have to move in . You ’ll break his heart if you do n’t . He so obviously loves you . ”
149456	149464	149413	149413	her	9246	“ He still has n’t said it . ”
149465	149494	149403	149403	She	9246	“ But did n’t he ? Asking you to move in with him … that seems like saying it to me . In the only way Hudson can . ”
149544	149548	149533	149533	she	9246	“ Damn it . ”
149595	149605	149581	149581	Hudson	1556	“ I do need a new place to live . ”
149606	149621	149581	149581	Hudson	1556	“ Get out ! This is perfect then . Like , fated or whatever . ”
149701	149721	149741	149741	I	884	“ Ah , I ca n’t talk about this anymore . It ’s making me all twitchy and emotional . ”
149729	149740	149722	149722	Celia	9246	“ But you ’re going to say yes , right ? ”
149748	149752	149753	149753	Celia	9246	“ You are ! ”
149759	149794	149753	149753	Celia	9246	“ I feel like I should hug you . I ’m a hugger . But we ’re eating and in a restaurant so maybe that would be weird . This will have to do . ”
149875	149886	149863	149863	She	9246	“ When are you going to tell him ? Tonight ? ”
149887	149928	149863	149863	She	9246	“ No . I do n’t think so . I have a meeting at eight - thirty so he ’s taking me to an early dinner at six and I do n’t want to tell him when we ’re rushed . ”
149932	149940	149929	149929	She	9246	“ You have a meeting ? Tonight ? ”
149941	149952	149955	149955	I	884	“ Yeah . Why do you think that ’s weird ? ”
149960	149992	149929	149929	She	9246	“ Not weird . Just horrible that you have to work on a Friday evening . Does n’t the fact that you ’re sleeping with the boss award you certain privileges ? ”
149996	150025	149993	149993	I	884	“ You would think . It was Hudson that set it up for me , and I do n’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth . ”
150026	150031	150032	150032	She	9246	“ Oh . Interesting . ”
150051	150059	150032	150032	She	9246	“ Who ’s the meeting with anyway ? ”
150060	150064	149993	149993	I	884	“ Aaron Trent . ”
150065	150073	150079	150079	she	9246	“ Wow . Major score , Laynie . ”
150087	150110	150079	150079	she	9246	“ I guess you ca n’t complain about landing a meeting with Aaron Trent . Even if it occupies your Friday night . ”
150111	150134	150135	150135	I	884	“ And that ’s the privilege I get for sleeping with the boss . Good contacts . I owe Hudson big time . ”
150143	150154	150135	150135	I	884	“ Except he hates being referred to as my boss . ”
150155	150163	150079	150079	she	9246	“ Why does n’t that surprise me ? ”
150164	150191	150135	150135	I	884	“ So I ’ll tell him I ’ll move in tomorrow . No big deal . Then I can plan some way special to tell him . ”
150228	150239	150240	150240	Celia	9246	“ Hey , can I borrow your phone a minute ? ”
150247	150252	150253	150253	I	884	“ Uh , yeah . ”
150267	150299	150300	150300	She	9246	“ Thanks . Mine is acting so stupid . It does n’t ring half the time , which I figure is part of the reason I never get to the phone . ”
150310	150316	150317	150317	She	9246	“ See ? Not ringing . ”
150324	150339	150317	150317	She	9246	“ Nothing . I guess I need to take my phone in . Thanks . ”
150340	150344	150345	150345	I	884	“ No problem . ”
150357	150376	150345	150345	I	884	“ Oh , I , um , I did n’t end up telling Hudson I saw you yesterday . ”
150377	150387	150317	150317	She	9246	“ Decided it was too tricky of a convo ? ”
150388	150399	150345	150345	I	884	“ It never came up . And then after today — ”
150400	150409	150410	150410	she	9246	“ You are n’t going to tell him , ”
150415	150450	150410	150410	she	9246	“ I would n’t either . I mean , I really do n’t want to encourage secrets , but this is really no big deal . And Hudson would make it a big deal . ”
150451	150456	150345	150345	I	884	“ A huge deal . ”
150466	150478	150345	150345	I	884	“ So we ’re good keeping it on the down low ? ”
150479	150490	150410	150410	she	9246	“ I wo n’t say a word . Pinky swear . ”
150491	150495	150496	150496	I	884	“ Pinky swear . ”
150673	150676	150657	150657	I	884	“ Liesl ! ”
150701	150706	150707	150707	Liesl	166	“ Hey , girlfriend ! ”
150733	150739	150740	150740	She	166	“ You ’re looking hot . ”
150752	150762	150740	150740	She	166	“ Things must still be good with Houston Piers . ”
150763	150767	150768	150768	I	884	“ Hudson Pierce , ”
150771	150777	150768	150768	I	884	“ Say it with me . ”
150788	150804	150805	150805	She	166	“ I know his name . Now . I just like dickin ’ with you . ”
150808	150826	150805	150805	She	166	“ Tell me all about you and the psychotically hot one . And start with the sex . ”
150827	150834	150835	150835	I	884	“ That would take a while . ”
150986	150992	150978	150978	She	166	“ But things are good ? ”
151015	151032	151011	151011	I	884	“ Things are very good , actually . Wanna do lunch some time and catch up ? ”
151038	151045	151033	151033	Her	166	“ Definitely . I miss you ! ”
151046	151053	151055	151055	Celia	9246	“ I miss you , too ! ”
151080	151096	151097	151097	She	166	“ You have your purse on your shoulder . Does that mean you ’re leaving ? ”
151112	151129	151065	151065	Liesl	166	“ I am . But I ’ll be back . Hudson ’s taking me to dinner . ”
151130	151142	151143	151143	She	166	“ Yeah , dinner . That ’s what it ’s called . ”
151146	151171	151143	151143	She	166	“ But David said you ’d been here all day , so why are you coming back ? We got your night shifts covered . ”
151172	151190	151065	151065	Liesl	166	“ I know , and thanks so much for that . But I have a meeting later . ”
151191	151194	151195	151195	She	166	“ Oh . ”
151210	151226	151195	151195	She	166	“ Wait , does that meeting of yours happen to be with some Trent guy ? ”
151227	151230	151233	151233	she	166	“ Yes — ”
151235	151246	151233	151233	she	166	“Liesl , is there something you forgot to tell me ? ”
151259	151275	151276	151276	She	166	“ Yeah , his secretary called a while ago and said he needs to reschedule . ”
151287	151297	151349	151349	Liesl	166	“ Sorry . Guess I forgot to mention it . ”
151298	151338	151349	151349	Liesl	166	“ No , it ’s fine . It ’s actually awesome news . Okay , maybe not exactly awesome since I spent all flipping day preparing to meet with the guy , but now I have Friday night off . ”
151339	151348	151349	151349	Liesl	166	“ And now you ’re not coming back . ”
151356	151365	151366	151366	My	884	“ Nope . My turn to say sorry . ”
151379	151388	151375	151375	he	2523	“ That ’s Hudson . Got ta go . ”
151389	151397	151398	151398	Liesl	166	“ You ’re choosing him over me ? ”
151406	151417	151418	151418	I	884	“ You do n’t have the goods that Hudson does . ”
151428	151449	151418	151418	I	884	“ I have different goods . Still good goods , though . You just need to give them a chance ! ”
151556	151559	151560	151560	I	884	“ Hey , ”
151581	151588	151574	151574	He	655	“ Good evening , Ms. Withers . ”
151610	151626	151589	151589	I	884	“ A limousine two nights in a row ? What ’s the occasion this time ? ”
151627	151637	151606	151606	Hudson	1556	“ I thought we had a nice drive yesterday . ”
151663	151672	151673	151673	I	884	“ A nice drive or a nice ride ? ”
151697	151709	151710	151710	His	655	“ If I remember correctly , you rode . I drove . ”
151864	151872	151855	151855	I	884	“ So … how was your day ? ”
151903	151922	151890	151890	His	655	“ You were there for the only part of today that mattered . And that part was fantastic . ”
151950	151956	151923	151923	He	655	“ How about your day ? ”
151957	151960	151961	151961	I	884	“ Ditto . ”
152005	152016	152001	152001	Us	2534	“ Though , I do have a surprise for you . ”
152025	152032	152017	152017	His	655	“ Are you not wearing underwear ? ”
152104	152131	152092	152092	We	2534	“ I ’m wearing underwear , you perv . If you ’d wanted me to go without , you should n’t have stocked me with panties . ”
152132	152153	152092	152092	We	2534	“ The panties were for when you were in the company of others . And right now we ’re alone . ”
152180	152183	152168	152168	Jordan	655	“ Somewhat . ”
152184	152188	152189	152189	He	655	“ Somewhat enough . ”
152232	152238	152207	152207	his	655	“ Tell me your surprise . ”
152239	152262	152207	152207	his	655	“ I spent most of my day preparing for my meeting with Aaron Trent . And I just found out he canceled . ”
152263	152267	152268	152268	Hudson	1556	“ He canceled ? ”
152284	152314	152273	152273	He	655	“ Let me call him . If he ca n’t bother to show up tonight then he does n’t need to bother working on my other accounts with him . ”
152327	152365	152315	152315	I	884	“ He must have had a good reason to cancel . I ’ll call him in the morning . It ’s not a biggie . I had a long day anyway and I ’m happy to postpone . ”
152366	152374	152323	152323	his	655	“ Then I ’ll call to reschedule . ”
152375	152383	152384	152384	I	884	“ No , let me . Please . ”
152434	152445	152423	152423	I	884	“ I ’d like to handle this on my own . ”
152453	152475	152446	152446	Hudson	1556	“ If that ’s what you want . But tell me if he does n’t give you the respect you deserve . ”
152476	152494	152446	152446	Hudson	1556	“ Because my rich , powerful boyfriend stepping in to fight my battles will earn his esteem . ”
152495	152506	152446	152446	Hudson	1556	“ Is n’t that what boyfriends are supposed to do ? ”
152507	152514	152446	152446	Hudson	1556	“ Um , not my boyfriend . ”
152534	152557	152523	152523	I	884	“ I ’ll let you know when I need you , H. For now , though , let me do this myself ? ”
152558	152562	152563	152563	He	655	“ Of course . ”
152614	152640	152641	152641	He	655	“ And , the awesome thing about him canceling is that now you ’ve got me all night . Whatcha gon na do with me ? ”
152649	152657	152641	152641	He	655	“ You ’re not going back tonight ? ”
152658	152680	152681	152681	I	884	“ Nope . I ’m all yours . You can take me out , and then I can take you in . ”
152712	152714	152705	152705	Our	2536	“ show ”
152716	152719	152705	152705	Our	2536	“ sex . ”
152751	152758	152732	152732	Hudson	1556	“ Actually , I ca n’t . ”
152766	152780	152759	152759	He	655	“ I arranged dinner with you , but then I have other plans . ”
152781	152784	152785	152785	I	884	“ Oh . ”
152788	152800	152785	152785	I	884	“ Yeah , of course . I should n’t have assumed . ”
152861	152864	152858	152858	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna . ”
152865	152871	152872	152872	My	884	“ Nope , my bad . ”
152883	152902	152872	152872	My	884	“ I ’ll watch one of my movies or catch up on my reading . Not a biggie . ”
152903	152910	152858	152858	Hudson	1556	“ But we still have dinner . ”
152911	152914	152915	152915	I	884	“ Yep . ”
153070	153082	153062	153062	I	884	“ So , um , what exactly are your other plans ? ”
153099	153103	153104	153104	He	655	“ It ’s ... ”
153109	153114	153104	153104	He	655	“ It ’s nothing . ”
153122	153140	153141	153141	I	884	“ Seriously ? You ca n’t say it ’s nothing and expect me to let that drop . ”
153226	153237	153223	153223	he	655	“ I ’m going to a dinner with my mother . ”
153260	153263	153264	153264	I	884	“ Oh . ”
153279	153288	153264	153264	I	884	“ But we ’re going to dinner now . ”
153296	153304	153289	153289	He	655	“ I was planning to eat light . ”
153305	153329	153333	153335	an understanding girlfriend	2541	“ You were planning to eat twice ? We can skip dinner . Eat with her . I can catch a bite later . ”
153358	153371	153289	153289	He	655	“ I ’d rather eat with you and skip dinner with her . ”
153372	153377	153289	153289	He	655	“ Then do that . ”
153378	153393	153289	153289	He	655	“ I ca n’t . It ’s her birthday . She expects me there . ”
153405	153421	153289	153289	He	655	“ Today ’s your mother ’s birthday and you were n’t going to mention it ? ”
153436	153446	153422	153422	He	655	“ It ’s not like you two are close . ”
153447	153452	153453	153453	I	884	“ But you are ! ”
153468	153510	153453	153453	I	884	“ She ’s your mother . Your family is important to you , whether you want to admit it or not . If I ’m important to you , too , then should n’t you share what ’s up with them ? ”
153530	153552	153553	153553	He	655	“ You are important to me , Alayna , and me not telling you about this has no reflection on that . ”
153558	153576	153553	153553	He	655	“ You were going to be at work , there was no reason to even mention it . ”
153577	153585	153553	153553	He	655	“ But now I ’m not working ... ”
153586	153592	153553	153553	He	655	“ And now you know . ”
153779	153790	153768	153768	I	884	“ Is it just going to be you and her ? ”
153791	153805	153762	153762	he	655	“ No . The rest of my family will be there , too . ”
153810	153821	153806	153806	My	884	“ And you ’re still not going to invite me ? ”
153822	153829	153768	153768	I	884	“ No , I ’m not . ”
153887	153900	153869	153869	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s family only , Alayna . Not a big deal . ”
153901	153911	153912	153912	I	884	“ Family only . Yep , I get it . ”
153971	153992	153945	153947	Hudson ’s father	1627	“ Family only . And you do n’t get along with Sophia . Why would you want to be there ? ”
153993	154002	154003	154003	I	884	“ Because you ’re going to be there . ”
154012	154061	154003	154003	I	884	“ And we ’re a couple , Hudson . When we were pretending to be a couple , you wanted her to see me with you all the time . Now that we ’re really a couple , you do n’t . That does n’t make any sense . ”
154062	154087	154088	154088	His	884	“ Now I care more about you than her , and I ’m not going to subject you to an evening with my mother . ”
154130	154152	154153	154153	My	884	“ Ca n’t you understand that you not letting me go feels like you ’re leaving me out of your life ? ”
154157	154161	154153	154153	My	884	“ It hurts . ”
154162	154182	154153	154153	My	884	“ I ’m not leaving you out of my life . I ’m leaving her out of your life . ”
154183	154226	154227	154227	I	884	“ It does n’t work like that . You ca n’t protect me . Besides , it feels like an excuse . It feels like you ’re ashamed of me or like I ’m not good enough to be with your family . ”
154263	154278	154305	154305	His	2546	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . You ’ve been with my family many times . ”
154279	154285	154289	154289	my	884	“ Then why not tonight ? ”
154400	154412	154395	154395	I	884	“ Jordan , can you drop me off at my apartment ? ”
154423	154429	154417	154417	Hudson	1556	“ Ignore that , Jordan . ”
154430	154448	154449	154449	I	884	“ I want to go home , Hudson . I ca n’t be with you right now . ”
154475	154488	154460	154460	him	2546	“ I do n’t want to be touched right now . Please . ”
154528	154536	154537	154537	He	2546	“ Stop it . Stop fighting me . ”
154563	154567	154556	154556	I	884	“ Stop fighting . ”
154568	154574	154575	154575	I	884	“ Then stop hurting me , ”
154594	154598	154599	154599	He	2546	“ All right . ”
154611	154636	154599	154599	He	2546	“ You can come . If you really want to be part of this awful night , then you are welcome to join me . ”
154747	154751	154752	154752	My	884	“ Now what ? ”
154768	154775	154776	154776	I	884	“ I ’m such a bitch , ”
154782	154785	154776	154776	I	884	“ What ? ”
154797	154829	154786	154786	I	884	“ I ’m a total bitch . I did n’t mean to pressure you into an invite , and I did . I wo n’t go , I ’ll stay home . ”
154856	154892	154842	154842	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re not a bitch . And you did n’t pressure me into anything . You ’re coming with me . It will be awful , but at least it will be awful together . ”
154907	154912	154900	154900	I	884	“ Are you sure ? ”
154913	154923	154842	154842	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m completely sure it will be awful . ”
154927	154935	154924	154924	I	884	“ Are you sure I can come ? ”
154950	154965	154936	154936	He	687	“ I am . I want you there . I always wanted you there . ”
154974	155003	154966	154966	He	687	“ But my mother is mean and terrible and she wants to hurt me . And she knows the easiest way to hurt me is to hurt you . ”
155023	155035	155013	155013	his	687	“ I ca n’t bear to watch you go through that . ”
155065	155089	155044	155044	I	884	“ Nothing she says or does means anything to me . Do you hear me ? I already won . I have you . ”
155142	155150	155124	155124	me	884	“ You do have me . Completely . ”
155233	155250	155226	155226	His	687	“ You ’ll need a dress . We should have time to stop by the boutique . ”
155260	155273	155251	155251	He	687	“ Jordan , change of plans . Take us to Mirabelle ’s . ”
155380	155389	155390	155390	he	655	“ Thanks , we ’re on our way , ”
155396	155403	155404	155404	he	655	“ She wo n’t be there , ”
155414	155431	155404	155404	he	655	“ She ’s getting ready for the party . But Stacy will take care of you . ”
155574	155609	155566	155566	I	884	“ If Mira ’s not going to be there , maybe we should n’t bother with the boutique . We could go back to my place and get something that we bought last time . ”
155610	155626	155569	155572	a much happier person	2562	“ No , we need something new . I ’ll want to show you off . ”
155994	156004	155980	155984	construction workers at the shop	2570	“ I wonder what ’s going on over there . ”
156010	156036	156005	156005	Hudson	1556	“ Mirabelle ’s expanding . I believe they ’ve almost finished . We ’ll come to the open house . She ’ll want you there . ”
156037	156054	156005	156005	Hudson	1556	“ Wow . More clothes for me to choose from . Can your wallet handle it ? ”
156097	156126	156083	156083	Stacy	8674	“ I have a client I ’m finishing up with , but I already picked out some options for you . They ’re in the big dressing room . ”
156465	156469	156459	156459	He	884	“ This one . ”
156477	156493	156459	156459	He	884	“ I have n’t tried it on . You do n’t even know how it — ”
156494	156499	156500	156500	He	884	“ I do know . ”
156528	156533	156524	156524	he	884	“ It ’s perfect . ”
156653	156664	156645	156645	Hudson	1556	“ I know what you ’re thinking . Stop it . ”
156690	156715	156675	156675	I	884	“ I ’m thinking about it , too . And we do n’t have time to deal with those thoughts as I would like . ”
156716	156721	156722	156722	I	884	“ Are you sure ? ”
156739	156767	156733	156733	He	884	“ You ’re certainly a different woman than the one I brought in here last time . The one who wanted to keep things sex - free . ”
156790	156814	156733	156733	He	884	“ I never wanted to keep things sex - free . I just thought it would be best for me if we did . ”
156883	156894	156869	156869	He	884	“ Is that still what would be best for you ? ”
156964	156971	156972	156972	My	884	“ You ’re best for me . ”
156984	156995	156972	156972	My	884	“ In every way — beside me , inside me … ”
156996	157009	156972	156972	My	884	“ Fuck , Alayna . You get me so hot , I — ”
157045	157057	157032	157032	Her	8674	“ I should have waited for an invitation to come in . ”
157058	157065	157032	157032	Her	8674	“ Yes , you should have . ”
157109	157120	157121	157121	He	884	“ I ’ll step out while you change , Alayna . ”
157129	157133	157121	157121	He	884	“ That one . ”
157189	157201	157202	157202	Her	8674	“ Is that the dress you ’d like to start with ? ”
157237	157247	157221	157221	I	884	“ Yes . It ’s the one Hudson wants . ”
157261	157269	157221	157221	I	884	“ He thinks it will be perfect . ”
157413	157424	157425	157425	I	884	“ He ’s right . It ’s perfect for you . ”
157538	157544	157530	157530	Stacy	8674	“ He has good taste . ”
157579	157583	157548	157548	she	8674	“ But … ? ”
157588	157592	157584	157584	Her	8674	“ But what ? ”
157593	157603	157548	157548	she	8674	“ I sense there was more to your statement . ”
157619	157626	157604	157604	She	8674	“ It ’s not my place . ”
157627	157642	157644	157644	I	884	“ Go ahead . Whatever you have to say , I can take it . ”
157682	157684	157685	157685	I	884	“ well ”
157760	157769	157756	157756	I	884	“ I know you ’ve dated Hudson before . ”
157777	157785	157770	157770	She	8674	“ Is that what he told you ? ”
157804	157831	157786	157786	I	884	“ He has n’t told me anything about you . I ’ve seen a picture of the two of you together at an event or something . ”
157832	157835	157836	157836	She	8674	“ Right . ”
157850	157863	157836	157836	She	8674	“ I was his escort for the night . We never dated . ”
157864	157867	157868	157868	My	884	“ Escort ? ”
157881	157894	157836	157836	She	8674	“ Not that kind of escort . I never slept with him . ”
158018	158026	158027	158027	She	8674	“ Oh . I think I understand . ”
158210	158216	158217	158217	she	700	“ Maybe you do understand , ”
158221	158234	158217	158217	she	700	“ And maybe Hudson ’s changed . But I should warn you — ”
158235	158244	158217	158217	she	700	“ I do n’t need to be warned . ”
158283	158294	158295	158295	I	884	“ I mean , he ’s already told me everything . ”
158313	158317	158304	158304	Stacy	8674	“ Has he ? ”
158343	158361	158362	158362	She	700	“ Believe whatever . All I ’m saying is he ’s not what he says he is . ”
158369	158382	158362	158362	She	700	“ No matter what he tells you , it ’s a lie . ”
158420	158430	158431	158431	I	884	“ But it ’s not just what he said , ”
158436	158449	158431	158431	I	884	“ He ’s shown me who he is . And Celia said — ”
158453	158457	158450	158450	Stacy	8674	“ Celia Werner ? ”
158466	158479	158461	158461	Her	8674	“ Do n’t believe anything she says either . They ’re together . ”
158480	158485	158486	158486	I	884	“ They ’re friends . ”
158506	158511	158512	158512	Her	8674	“ They ’re together . ”
158518	158531	158512	158512	Her	8674	“ Or they were . I can prove it too , if — ”
158563	158566	158567	158567	He	2604	“ Gorgeous . ”
158648	158652	158653	158653	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
158672	158681	158656	158656	I	884	“ It is gorgeous . You chose well . ”
158682	158690	158711	158711	He	2604	“ I did . I chose you . ”
158727	158734	158735	158735	His	2604	“ She ’ll wear it out . ”
158792	158809	158784	158784	she	8674	“ Hudson , I ’ll be a minute . I need to freshen up my face . ”
158864	158885	158859	158859	I	884	“ Would you mind picking out some other shoes for me , H ? Those ones do n’t quite go . ”
158895	158912	158886	158886	He	2604	“ No , they do n’t . I saw some silver heels that would look stunning . ”
158935	158941	158942	158942	I	884	“ Grab them for me ? ”
158984	158990	158991	158991	He	2604	“ Sure thing , baby . ”
159062	159070	159071	159071	I	884	“ You said you could prove it . ”
159147	159152	159139	159139	I	884	“ Can you really ? ”
159153	159161	159169	159169	She	8674	“ Yes . Not here , but — ”
159162	159168	159139	159139	I	884	“ Give me your phone . ”
159190	159196	159178	159178	I	884	“ You can text me . ”
159388	159392	159393	159394	the host	2615	“ Mr. Pierce , ”
159400	159411	159393	159394	the host	2615	“ Your party is already seated . Right this way . ”
159774	159784	159771	159771	I	884	“ I thought you said this was family only . ”
159808	159821	159803	159803	Hudson	1556	“ She left something in the car . Excuse us a moment . ”
160100	160107	160081	160081	He	2630	“ The Werners are practically family . ”
160145	160152	160136	160136	I	884	“ Right . Uh - huh . ”
160186	160200	160201	160201	His	2630	“ What , do you think I did n’t tell you on purpose ? ”
160216	160228	160209	160209	I	884	“ You do n’t want to know what I ’m thinking . ”
160229	160235	160201	160201	His	2630	“ Actually , I do . ”
160240	160247	160236	160236	I	884	“ No , you do n’t . ”
160311	160321	160304	160304	I	884	“ Trust me when I tell you I do . ”
160322	160388	160304	160304	I	884	“ Hudson , you ca n’t say that when you do n’t know what I want to say . It ’s not good . In fact , you need to leave me alone . Or I ’m going to blame you for things . Things I ’m probably overreacting about and you ’re going to be offended . And I ’m going to lose you . ”
160439	160448	160449	160449	He	2634	“ You are n’t going to lose me . ”
160514	160531	160503	160503	I	884	“ You have n’t seen this side of me , Hudson . You do n’t know . ”
160532	160548	160549	160549	He	2634	“ Then I need to stay . I need to see every side of you . ”
160679	160686	160657	160657	He	2634	“ Go ahead . Ask me . ”
160687	160699	160700	160700	I	884	“ It wo n’t be asking ; it will be accusing . ”
160800	160822	160788	160788	his	2634	“ Do it . I want to hear it . I need to know what you ’re thinking . Trust me . ”
160857	160872	160854	160854	I	884	“ You did n’t invite me tonight because you knew she ’d be here . ”
160892	160921	160884	160884	He	2634	“ That ’s not true . I told you why I did n’t invite you . And I did invite you in the end . You ’re here . ”
160922	160932	160933	160933	I	884	“ But you did n’t want to at first . ”
160954	160987	160944	160944	I	884	“ That ’s probably why you had to doll me up . To show up Celia , whatever your game with her is . It was n’t about your mother at all . ”
160988	160993	161044	161044	he	884	“ You ’re right . ”
160999	161035	160944	160944	I	884	“ You ’re right that it was n’t about my mother . It was about you . I wanted everyone to see how beautiful you are . How beautiful the woman who loves me is . ”
161064	161067	161068	161068	I	884	“ Celia , ”
161073	161083	161068	161068	I	884	“ You wanted to show Celia , you mean . ”
161090	161097	161098	161098	I	884	“ She ’s here , Hudson ! ”
161138	161172	161129	161129	I	884	“ She ’s here with free rein and I had to beg to be here . And you told me you would n’t see her without me . What is she to you ? ”
161173	161180	161118	161118	I	884	“ Nothing . An old friend . ”
161181	161184	161185	161185	My	884	“ Bullshit . ”
161202	161223	161185	161185	My	884	“ Otherwise you would have told me about this dinner from the beginning . You were hiding it from me . ”
161232	161242	161224	161224	I	884	“ Because you knew she would be here too . ”
161243	161249	161250	161250	His	884	“ I did n’t know . ”
161263	161267	161268	161268	he	884	“ I suspected , ”
161271	161294	161268	161268	he	884	“ But she ’s not here because of me . Her mother is my mother ’s best friend . You know that . ”
161295	161328	161369	161369	He	884	“ Fuck that . She ’s twenty - eight years old . She ’s old enough to not go to every goddamn function with her mother . She ’s here for you . ”
161329	161337	161338	161338	His	884	“ And I ’m here with you . ”
161351	161360	161369	161369	He	884	“ She ’s still in love with you . ”
161361	161368	161338	161338	His	884	“ And I ’m with you . ”
161406	161412	161392	161392	He	884	“ I ’m with you . ”
161567	161577	161578	161578	He	884	“ I ’m hard for you and only you . ”
161588	161596	161578	161578	He	884	“ It ’s you that I adore . ”
161725	161731	161732	161732	he	884	“ I ’m with you , ”
161785	161790	161791	161791	He	884	“ That ’s it . ”
161803	161812	161791	161791	He	884	“ Relax . Let me be with you . ”
161881	161894	161872	161872	he	884	“ It ’s you that I ’m about to go down on . ”
161904	161951	161895	161895	He	884	“ It ’s you I ’m going to make come with my mouth so that when we go back down there and you start to feel insecure , you will still be wet and you ’ll remember my lips were on you and no one else . ”
162102	162107	162108	162108	he	884	“ Take it out , ”
162136	162142	162132	162132	they	2645	“ We ’re not alone . ”
162143	162170	162132	162132	they	2645	“ Take it out . I do n’t care about anyone or anything but being inside you right now . I have to be inside you . ”
162263	162272	162273	162273	He	884	“ Goddamn , your pussy is so good . ”
162283	162301	162273	162273	He	884	“ Do you hear me ? Your pussy makes me this hard . No one else ’s . ”
162373	162408	162359	162359	His	884	“ When we go back down to dinner , I will smell like you and you will smell like me . And you ’ll remember that we are together . I am with you . ”
162432	162438	162429	162429	him	884	“ No one but you . ”
162581	162589	162569	162569	Sophia	1858	“ It ’s about time you returned . ”
162632	162637	162626	162626	Hudson	1556	“ We got distracted . ”
162721	162724	162725	162725	Mira	8319	“ Laynie ! ”
162735	162744	162725	162725	Mira	8319	“ I ’m so glad you made it ! ”
162771	162776	162777	162777	I	884	“ Me , too . ”
162862	162867	162868	162868	Jack	10551	“ Me , three , ”
162924	162931	162907	162907	Sophia	1858	“ Well , we already ordered . ”
162932	162942	162943	162943	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s fine . We ’ll catch up . ”
162975	162989	162990	162990	Sophia	1858	“ And while you ’re here , I ’ll have another of these . ”
163149	163162	163166	163166	his	2662	“ I hope you do n’t mind that I ordered for you . ”
163219	163234	163212	163212	his	2662	“ As long as my dish does n’t have mushrooms , I ’m happy . ”
163235	163238	163239	163239	he	2662	“ No , ”
163252	163266	163239	163239	he	2662	“ I would n’t want you gagging at my mother ’s birthday dinner . ”
163267	163272	163273	163273	I	884	“ Quite the opposite . ”
163288	163307	163273	163273	I	884	“ The way you ordered , I ’m salivating . I did n’t know you could speak French . ”
163308	163311	163312	163312	My	884	“ Fluently . ”
163316	163321	163322	163322	We	2667	“ Say something else ? ”
163353	163379	163380	163380	His	2662	“ Oui . Plus tard , quand tu es enveloppé dans mes bras , je vais parler jusqu'à ce que tu es éclatement avec passion . ”
163394	163400	163401	163401	I	884	“ What did you say ? ”
163419	163446	163405	163405	He	2662	“ I said , ‘ Yes . Later , when you ’re wrapped around me , I ’ll speak it until you shudder with delight . ’ ”
163453	163466	163467	163467	Sophia	1858	“ You know there are other people at this table , Hudson , ”
163528	163535	163523	163523	Mira	8319	“ Mother , leave them alone . ”
163557	163567	163545	163545	she	1120	“ Ca n’t you see they ’re in love ? ”
163621	163634	163617	163617	Sophia	1858	“ Or they ’re working awfully hard to make me believe that . ”
163665	163677	163650	163650	Mira	8319	“ Why on earth would they want to fake a relationship ? ”
163815	163846	163791	163791	Sophia	1858	“ Beats me . Why does Hudson like to do any of the shitty things he does to people ? I long ago gave up trying to figure it out . ”
164045	164064	164065	164065	Mira	8319	“ Just because it ’s your birthday does n’t mean you have the right to ditch being polite . ”
164068	164081	164065	164065	Mira	8319	“ No , she believes that merely breathing gives her that right . ”
164140	164152	164134	164134	She	2682	“ I ’m sorry . I should n’t have said that . ”
164153	164180	164181	164181	Sophia	1858	“ Thank you for the apology . You ’re hormonal . I do n’t know what Jack ’s excuse is for speaking to me so rudely . ”
164254	164257	164258	164258	she	1858	“ Chandler , ”
164270	164294	164258	164258	she	1858	“ Put down your damn phone and be present . I want to enjoy the evening with us together . All of us . ”
164612	164615	164609	164609	his	1286	“ Divine . ”
164621	164629	164616	164616	He	1286	“ I could say the same thing . ”
164777	164780	164781	164781	she	1556	“ Mira , ”
164794	164815	164781	164781	she	1556	“ Only four more months until the newest Pierce is introduced to the world . You must be so excited ! ”
164825	164829	164830	164830	She	8319	“ I am ! ”
164833	164849	164830	164830	She	8319	“ But when you say four more months , I want to puke a little . ”
164886	164920	164879	164879	Mira	8319	“ Sorry , not great dinner conversation . I wish it were sooner , that ’s all . I ’m anxious to have her in the world instead of sitting on my bladder . ”
164921	164932	164934	164935	his wife	1124	“ It will be here soon enough . Trust me . ”
164963	164984	164958	164958	He	245	“ That ’s not right , Madge . Mira ’s not a Pierce anymore . It will be baby Sitkin . ”
164994	165006	164985	164985	Mira	8319	“ Or Sitkin - Pierce , if we decide to hyphenate . ”
165060	165074	165075	165075	She	1858	“ It ’s not the same . Sitkin - Pierce is not Pierce . ”
165079	165090	165075	165075	She	1858	“ So the bloodline continues , but not the name . ”
165166	165180	165155	165155	Adam	700	“ Mira ’s not the only Pierce offspring . Chandler could have children . ”
165189	165201	165202	165202	Jack	10551	“ Then it will be the name but not the bloodline , ”
165242	165245	165246	165246	Chandler	676	“ What ? ”
165274	165277	165278	165278	Mira	8319	“ Nothing , ”
165284	165293	165278	165278	Mira	8319	“ Go back to whatever you were doing . ”
165319	165330	165305	165305	Sophia	1858	“ Hudson and Celia ’s baby could have been both . ”
165473	165491	165492	165492	He	10551	“ Not this again , Sophia . Really ? Goddammit , I wo n’t listen to this . ”
165511	165608	165508	165508	he	10551	“ Thank you everyone , I wish I could say it has been a lovely evening , but , well , I ’ll leave it at that . I ’ll take care of the bill on my way out . The rest of you stay and enjoy . Order dessert . As for my wife , I ’m not going to invite her to rot in hell as I probably should because I think she already lives there . At least hell is where anyone who spends time with her feels like they ’ve been sent . ”
165638	165644	165645	165645	She	1858	“ What a drama queen . ”
165653	165674	165645	165645	She	1858	“ I was merely pointing out that we had a chance at a Pierce grandchild and now it ’s gone . ”
165675	165681	165683	165683	his	10551	“ Talk about drama queen … ”
165722	165731	165713	165713	Hudson	1556	“ I could have a child with Alayna . ”
165992	166011	165971	165971	Sophia	1858	“ Are you talking marriage and children already ? It ’s early for that Hudson . Incredibly early . ”
166012	166036	166037	166037	Hudson	1556	“ Oh , Mother , do n’t be so old - fashioned . You do n’t need to be married to have children . ”
166076	166091	166059	166059	I	884	“ And what Alayna and I are discussing is frankly none of your business . ”
166097	166103	166092	166092	Sophia	1858	“ You brought it up . ”
166104	166127	166128	166128	His	2706	“ I was stating that I could father a child and that would continue both your precious bloodline and your precious name . ”
166168	166186	166162	166162	he	2706	“ And the only person I could ever imagine wanting to have a child with is Alayna . ”
166298	166303	166304	166304	My	884	“ Hudson , I … ”
166373	166388	166361	166361	he	2706	“ The point is that you need to let the past go , Mother . ”
166399	166415	166361	166361	he	2706	“ There is still a future to look forward to . For all of us . ”
166530	166537	166538	166538	I	884	“ If you ’ll excuse me , ”
166545	166554	166538	166538	I	884	“ I need to use the powder room . ”
166679	166684	166685	166685	someone	729	“ You look perfect , ”
166707	166725	166726	166726	She	9246	“ You just need a touch of gloss . I have some if you want to borrow . ”
166738	166751	166752	166752	I	884	“ No , I do n’t want to borrow anything from you . ”
166770	166775	166763	166763	she	9246	“ Hey , wait ! ”
166846	166856	166857	166857	Her	9246	“ I ’m not waiting all night . Speak . ”
166863	166902	166857	166857	Her	9246	“ Why are you angry with me ? I could feel the tension all through dinner . You would n’t even look at me . Which is why I followed you in here . Why are you mad ? ”
166903	166917	166857	166857	Her	9246	“ Do n’t play dumb , Celia . It does n’t suit you . ”
166918	166930	166931	166931	Her	9246	“ I ’m not playing . Spell it out for me . ”
166954	166957	166948	166948	she	9246	“ Please . ”
166958	166961	166963	166963	I	884	“ Celia … ”
166996	167053	166986	166986	I	884	“ I saw you today and you did n’t mention anything about this dinner tonight . And you know that I did n’t know because I told you that I had no plans to see Sophia and that I had a meeting tonight . All the while , you ’re saying you ’re rooting for me . ”
167079	167088	167074	167074	Celia	9246	“ You ’re right , you ’re right . ”
167097	167105	167089	167089	She	9246	“ I thought that might be it . ”
167112	167168	167089	167089	She	9246	“ I did n’t say anything , you ’re right , and I should have . But you were happy and beaming and things were going good , and when I realized that Hudson had n’t told you about the dinner , I did n’t want to stir things up between the two of you . ”
167169	167178	167193	167193	She	9246	“ Or you wanted him for yourself tonight . ”
167179	167192	167193	167193	She	9246	“ No ! I told you , I ’m not after Hudson . ”
167254	167337	167251	167251	her	9246	“ Look , Laynie , I ’m on your side . I am . Ca n’t you see what would have happened if I ’d brought it up ? You would have cornered Hudson about it and then you ’d have to tell him how you found out and that would mean you ’d have to tell him about us chatting about him behind his back . And he brought you anyway ! So it all worked out . Everything ’s good ! ”
167338	167345	167346	167346	I	884	“ Yeah , everything ’s great . ”
167392	167420	167387	167387	I	884	“ God , I ’m sorry . I just … I do n’t know who to trust . It feels like so many people are against us . ”
167433	167484	167421	167421	Her	2722	“ That ’s so not true . Sophia is against you . She ’s the only one . And my parents , but they ’re only trying to do what they think is best for me . It ’s a silly parent thing . They do n’t understand . Obviously . ”
167511	167542	167499	167499	They	2724	“ Why wo n’t you tell them ? It ’s been years , you said so yourself . Why do n’t you or Hudson admit the truth about the baby ? ”
167561	167580	167499	167499	They	2724	“ If you really cared about his happiness , you ’d tell the truth and set him free . ”
167581	167598	167599	167599	Her	2722	“ It seems like that would be the right thing to do , does n’t it ? ”
167621	167668	167616	167616	her	2722	“ It’s … it ’s complicated . I ca n’t say more than that . I ’m sorry , I wish I could . But it involves more than just me . You have to trust me , this is best for everyone . Hudson included . ”
167713	167726	167696	167696	Celia	9246	“ Like I said , I do n’t know what I trust . ”
167727	167730	167751	167751	hers	9246	“ Alayna — ”
167782	167811	167775	167776	the woman	1124	“ This is a bad time . But you have my number . Call me if you need anything . To sort things out or just to talk . ”
167878	167884	167885	167885	Celia	9246	“ kiss and make up , ”
167892	167910	167885	167885	Celia	9246	“ I want things to work out for Hudson more than you can imagine . Believe me . ”
168140	168143	168144	168144	I	884	“ Hey , ”
168162	168169	168154	168154	She	8319	“ You were talking to Celia . ”
168170	168173	168174	168174	I	884	“ Yeah . ”
168230	168241	168242	168242	Mira	8319	“ I do n’t think you should do that anymore . ”
168253	168256	168242	168242	Mira	8319	“ Why ? ”
168271	168319	168257	168257	She	8319	“ She ’s your competition , Laynie ! I mean , Hudson is totally into you and no one but you , but Celia is after him . She ’s pictured herself married to him for so long , it ’s a done deal in her head . ”
168320	168327	168335	168335	me	884	“ I know , I know . ”
168394	168427	168385	168385	I	884	“ She says she does n’t , though . Want him , I mean . She really seems like she might be over him . She ’s been really supportive , actually . ”
168437	168469	168428	168428	Mirabelle	1120	“ Okay . Maybe that ’s true . I might be overreacting . But I ’ve known her my whole life , and she has n’t always been the best person . ”
168559	168570	168571	168571	I	884	“ Hudson has n’t always been the best person either , ”
168581	168609	168610	168610	I	884	“ I ’m not saying that I ’m not for Hudson . I do n’t care what he ’s done or who he ’s been . Truly . ”
168638	168650	168653	168653	Mira	8319	“ It ’s only that we ’ve all been worse people . ”
168655	168668	168669	168669	I	884	“ At least , a lot of us have been worse people , ”
168672	168680	168681	168681	She	8319	“ I ’m sure that ’s true . ”
168694	168728	168681	168681	She	8319	“ But , do n’t feel like Celia ’s your only resource , okay ? If you need to talk , Laynie , call me . Or better yet , talk to Hudson . ”
168815	168825	168826	168826	She	2744	“ I ’ll talk to Hudson . Good idea . ”
168829	168843	168826	168826	She	2744	“ Sometimes I have them . Good ideas . Pregnancy brain and all . ”
168981	168988	168972	168972	Hudson	1556	“ Are you ready to go ? ”
169000	169008	168972	168972	Hudson	1556	“ I thought you ’d never ask . ”
169009	169016	169017	169017	He	2744	“ Then let ’s get going . ”
169061	169073	169054	169054	Sophia	1858	“ Were you planning on sneaking out without a proper goodbye ? ”
169093	169106	169080	169080	Hudson	1556	“ Were you waiting here to attack me in case I was ? ”
169116	169141	169107	169107	Sophia	1858	“ Of course not . I stepped away to call for my car . It ’s impolite to do such things at the table . ”
169173	169183	169165	169165	Hudson	1556	“ I already said goodbye to you , Mother . ”
169184	169188	169189	169189	She	1858	“ You did . ”
169194	169210	169189	169189	She	1858	“ She did n’t . In fact , I do n’t remember her saying hello . ”
169242	169247	169236	169236	I	884	“ Neither did you . ”
169248	169255	169256	169256	Her	1858	“ No , I did n’t . ”
169313	169347	169296	169296	I	884	“ Actually , I thought that was very clever of you , Sophia . The evening went fairly well when we were pretending each other did n’t exist . Do n’t you think ? ”
169348	169378	169379	169379	Sophia	1858	“ Thank you . It was purely unplanned , seeing as how I did n’t know you were coming until an hour before when Hudson called to tell me . ”
169421	169440	169416	169416	I	884	“ Oh , you did call , H ? I thought you were leaving it as a surprise . ”
169441	169464	169465	169465	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , I called while you were dressing . I decided that Sophia might be better behaved if she was prepared . ”
169519	169538	169496	169496	Her	876	“ Yes , it did work out well . I ’ll remember the ignoring tactic for next time . ”
169542	169555	169539	169539	My	884	“ Then you ’ve finally accepted there will be a next time ? ”
169570	169603	169558	169558	Her	876	“ I ’m nothing if not realistic , Alayna Withers . The question remains how many next times there will be . I ’m in Hudson ’s life permanently . Are you ? ”
169623	169656	169619	169619	Hudson	1556	“ Mother , stop it . It ’s your birthday . Happy day to you . If you ’re miserable , it ’s only because you wo n’t let yourself enjoy anything . ”
169783	169789	169790	169790	she	1858	“ You smell like sex , ”
169808	169817	169820	169820	his	2756	“ I ’m surprised you recognize the smell . ”
169870	169877	169854	169854	Sophia	1858	“ I ’m not a prude . ”
169889	169914	169878	169878	Hudson	1556	“ No , no one ’s accusing you of that . I ’m simply shocked you could smell anything over the aroma of bourbon . ”
169918	169924	169878	169878	Hudson	1556	“ Go home , Hudson . “
169925	169928	169854	169854	Sophia	1858	“ Gladly . ”
170355	170380	170352	170352	he	655	“ I have some work to do . It will likely be a late night . I do n’t expect you to wait up . ”
170381	170387	170352	170352	he	655	“ Oh . All right . ”
170436	170447	170419	170419	I	884	“ Do you need anything ? A nightcap , perhaps ? ”
170465	170474	170448	170448	He	655	“ I may make myself a Scotch later . ”
171737	171745	171732	171732	I	884	“ Where did you go ? Earlier . ”
171754	171764	171746	171746	He	655	“ Does it matter ? I ’m here now . ”
171885	171892	171893	171893	he	655	“ Mon amour . Mon précieux , ”
171899	171908	171893	171893	he	655	“ Mon chéri . Mon bien - aimé . ”
171990	172006	171973	171973	he	655	“ Je suis avec vous . Always . I ’m with you , mon précieux . ”
172036	172043	172044	172044	he	655	“ I know it ’s Saturday , ”
172052	172087	172044	172044	he	655	“ and it ’s early , but I have some business I have to take care of before it gets any later . Then I ’ll ravage you nonstop the rest of the weekend . ”
172088	172096	172097	172097	I	884	“ All right . If you must . ”
172141	172160	172136	172136	I	884	“ I have a few things to do as well so it works out . Lucky for you . ”
172161	172168	172169	172169	Hudson	1556	“ Lucky for me , indeed . ”
172311	172322	172307	172308	my brother	215	“ Oh my god , Laynie , are you okay ? ”
172341	172353	172354	172354	I	884	“ Of course I am . Why would n’t I be ? ”
172372	172384	172354	172354	I	884	“ Because you have n’t been at the club all week . ”
172385	172399	172307	172308	my brother	215	“ What are you talking about ? I ’ve been there every day . ”
172404	172450	172400	172400	He	215	“ I called and asked for you every night this week and you were never there . At first I thought you ’d told the staff you were n’t taking my calls but then I gave a different name and called from a different phone . ”
172451	172465	172400	172400	He	215	“ Jesus , Brian , I did n’t realize that stalking was genetic . ”
172466	172470	172471	172471	His	215	“ Ha ha . ”
172497	172516	172523	172523	his	215	“ I was n’t at the club because I ’m not working at night anymore , you moron . ”
172546	172568	172523	172523	his	215	“ I got a promotion . I ’m working marketing and promotional planning . Day hours . Just like you wanted . ”
172569	172584	172601	172601	he	215	“ Oh . Wow . Congratulations , Laynie . I ’m proud of you . ”
172641	172654	172608	172608	he	215	“ Whatever , Brian . I do n’t want to hear it . ”
172655	172660	172608	172608	he	215	“ I mean it . ”
172661	172681	172682	172682	Brian	1286	“ Only because you ’re happy that I ’m now following the plan you ’d laid out for me . ”
172782	172788	172789	172789	He	215	“ That ’s not true . ”
172799	172812	172789	172789	He	215	“ Wait , did you get this promotion because of Hudson Pierce ? ”
172819	172834	172794	172794	I	884	“ No . I did not . And fuck you very much for asking . ”
172835	172863	172794	172794	I	884	“ What do you expect me to assume , Laynie ? You want me to change my entire experience with you because you say things are different ? ”
172864	172875	172794	172794	I	884	“ I do n’t know what I expect , Brian . ”
172964	172978	172979	172979	He	215	“ What was so important that you needed to reach me , anyway ? ”
173002	173012	172997	172997	He	215	“ The lease on the apartment expires this month . ”
173021	173053	172997	172997	He	215	“ That ’s actually why I was calling you . I ’m moving out . So whatever you need to do to end the lease , go ahead and do it . ”
173054	173062	172999	172999	his	215	“ Where are you going to live ? ”
173081	173089	173074	173074	he	215	“ That ’s none of your business . ”
173098	173114	173074	173074	he	215	“ Fine , be a bitch . I ’m sure you think I deserve it . ”
173124	173136	173115	173115	I	884	“ What do you want me to do with the keys ? ”
173137	173158	173074	173074	he	215	“ You can give them to me personally when I come there . When are you planning to be out ? ”
173159	173167	173169	173169	Hudson	1556	“ In the next week or so . ”
173218	173227	173214	173214	I	884	“ Why do you need to come here ? ”
173228	173252	173319	173319	Brian	1286	“ To make sure the place is in good shape before I turn it over . I want to get my deposit back . ”
173258	173307	173253	173253	I	884	“ You were there Monday , Brian . You saw what shape it was in . I did n’t destroy the apartment after you left , if that ’s what you ’re suggesting . Do you think I ’d do that just because I ’m pissed at you ? ”
173308	173318	173319	173319	Brian	1286	“ I do n’t know what you would do . ”
173325	173338	173319	173319	Brian	1286	“ I ’m not surprised by anything anymore where you ’re concerned . ”
173339	173369	173370	173370	I	884	“ This conversation is pointless . Text me when you ’re in town and I ’ll get you your fucking keys . Other than that , we ’re done . ”
174076	174081	174062	174062	My	884	“ Am I interrupting ? ”
174082	174094	174095	174095	He	2816	“ Not at all . I ’m done for the day . ”
174110	174115	174098	174098	I	884	“ Done with work . ”
174116	174132	174133	174133	I	884	“ Sounds like your phone call was a lot more productive than mine was then . ”
174174	174197	174166	174166	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s amazing I could even concentrate with your gorgeous mouth wrapped around your fruit . But that was your intention . ”
174206	174217	174198	174198	I	884	“ I have no idea what you ’re talking about . ”
174226	174234	174235	174235	He	2816	“ Such a wicked , wicked tease . ”
174249	174256	174235	174235	He	2816	“ Who was your conversation with ? ”
174257	174265	174218	174218	His	2816	“ My brother . It was painful . ”
174266	174273	174274	174274	His	2816	“ Want to talk about it ? ”
174288	174291	174274	174274	His	2816	“ Nope . ”
174296	174315	174274	174274	His	2816	“ I ’m not letting him ruin my day and this day is fabulous . You know why ? ”
174316	174326	174218	174218	His	2816	“ Because I ’m about to pounce on you ? ”
174327	174331	174332	174332	God	8844	“ That too . ”
174344	174360	174332	174332	God	8844	“ But also because the event planners I met with agreed to make a deal . ”
174361	174373	174374	174374	His	2816	“ Of course they did . You ’re brilliant , remember ? ”
174393	174401	174374	174374	His	2816	“ This is with Party Planners Plus ? ”
174406	174412	174402	174402	I	884	“ Wow . Good memory . ”
174442	174449	174425	174425	he	2816	“ Only where you ’re concerned . ”
174484	174499	174500	174500	He	379	“ Congratulations . I ca n’t wait to see what you do with them . ”
174529	174533	174534	174534	My	884	“ Me neither . ”
174550	174562	174563	174563	I	884	“ It ’s a start . I ’m excited about it . ”
174589	174598	174574	174574	Hudson	1556	“ Then we both have good news today . ”
174599	174604	174605	174605	My	884	“ Tell me yours . ”
174654	174685	174644	174644	his	379	“ I was on the phone with a contact in Japan . I ’ve asked him to arrange for me to make a trip there in the next few days . ”
174690	174695	174686	174686	My	884	“ What ? Why ? ”
174718	174726	174644	174644	his	379	“ To make a bid for Plexis . ”
174727	174739	174686	174686	My	884	“ Really ? Oh , Hudson , that ’s so great ! ”
174740	174755	174756	174756	Hudson	1556	“ I approached that gentleman you heard talking . His name is Mitch Larson . ”
174773	174816	174756	174756	Hudson	1556	“ Turns out he does n’t have any selling power in his company , but he arranged for me to bid directly to his boss in Japan . I would n’t have gotten the meeting if I had n’t gone through Mitch . ”
174829	174846	174820	174820	he	379	“ And I would n’t have known to approach Mitch if it were n’t for you . ”
174864	174881	174847	174847	I	884	“ I would n’t have even been at that party if it were n’t for you . ”
174882	174908	174909	174909	His	379	“ You could easily have tuned the conversation out . Or not bothered to tell me . You did . For which I ’m grateful . ”
174958	174964	174950	174950	I	884	“ How grateful are you ? ”
174965	174971	174972	174972	He	379	“ I think you know . ”
175179	175190	175191	175191	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , there ’s something I need to say . ”
175203	175211	175191	175191	Hudson	1556	“ About yesterday . About moving in . ”
175232	175235	175215	175215	he	379	“ Yes ? ”
175236	175244	175215	175215	he	379	“ I do n’t want you here … ”
175267	175303	175264	175264	he	379	“ … so I can control you . I want you here because I ca n’t bear it when you ’re not . I want you here because I want you with me — always . ”
175318	175321	175311	175311	I	884	“ Okay . ”
175330	175339	175322	175322	His	379	“ Good . I needed you to understand . ”
175340	175351	175352	175352	I	884	“ No , not okay , I understand . Well , ”
175355	175371	175352	175352	I	884	“ that too . But I meant okay , I ’ll move in with you . ”
175379	175383	175372	175372	Hudson	1556	“ You will ? ”
175390	175417	175372	175372	Hudson	1556	“ Why are you so surprised ? I ’d think you ’d be used to getting your way . I bet you get everything you want . ”
175418	175451	175352	175352	I	884	“ Most everything . But I often have to fight first . And I was prepared to fight for this . For you . It was much easier than I ’d planned . ”
175452	175479	175480	175480	I	884	“ Probably because I ’d already decided to say yes . But even if I had n’t , you would have won me over with that . ”
175491	175533	175480	175480	I	884	“ Hudson , I want to be with you always , too . And who the hell cares if people say it ’s insane or too soon because I ’m already crazy and I ’m already madly in love with you . ”
175534	175537	175538	175538	His	884	“ Alayna . ”
175860	175867	175871	175871	him	884	“ Oh , god , Hudson ! ”
176236	176240	176241	176241	Hudson	1556	“ Once more , ”
176248	176251	176252	176252	I	884	“ No ! ”
176263	176270	176252	176252	I	884	“ I ca n’t take it . ”
176271	176275	176276	176276	He	884	“ Once more . ”
176605	176665	176598	176598	he	884	“ I know it ’s scary and our situation has n’t been ideal , but you are everything good for me . Nothing in this world is important to me beyond you . I can be the same for you . I know it . And I ’m so grateful you ’ve given me the chance to prove it . ”
176672	176689	176666	176666	I	884	“ You have nothing to prove . You ’re already everything good for me , too . ”
176690	176693	176694	176694	He	884	“ Shh . ”
176699	176716	176694	176694	He	884	“ Not yet . I have n’t been able to give you everything you need yet . ”
176772	176782	176783	176783	He	884	“ It ’s okay , Hudson . It ’s — ”
176788	176828	176829	176829	He	884	“ It ’s not . But I need you to know that I ’m trying and I ’m not going to stop trying until I get there . Do you hear me ? Do n’t give up on me . ”
176837	176846	176847	176847	I	884	“ I ’m not giving up on you . ”
176863	176879	176857	176857	he	884	“ Why would I do that ? I love you , Hudson . So much . ”
176895	176911	176880	176880	His	884	“ I do n’t deserve your love . I do n’t think I ever will . ”
176912	176923	176880	176880	His	884	“ You deserve more than I can ever give you . ”
176924	176944	176945	176945	He	884	“ We have a difference of opinion on that . We ’ll have to agree to disagree . Again . ”
176951	176954	176955	176955	he	884	“ Turn , ”
176993	176997	176998	176998	he	884	“ This time , ”
177006	177015	176998	176998	he	884	“ we ’re going to take it slow . ”
177062	177066	177058	177058	he	884	“ his people , ”
177440	177460	177436	177438	Trent ’s assistant	2836	“ I need to make an appointment with Aaron Trent . Is that something you can help me with ? ”
177472	177494	177436	177438	Trent ’s assistant	2836	“ I can take your information , but I ’ll have to check with him before any meeting time is approved . ”
177495	177500	177501	177501	I	884	“ That makes sense . ”
177540	177549	177535	177535	I	884	“ This is Alayna Withers from The Sky — ”
177550	177554	177555	177556	Bubbly Professional	328	“ Ms. Withers , ”
177561	177592	177555	177556	Bubbly Professional	328	“ I did n’t realize it was you . Mr. Trent said if you called that we could go ahead and reschedule for whenever would be most convenient for you . ”
177593	177598	177601	177601	he	328	“ Oh . Okay . ”
177693	177721	177684	177684	I	884	“ Hey , do you have any idea why Mr. Trent canceled to begin with ? I know it ’s none of my business . Just curious . ”
177727	177756	177722	177723	Bubbly Professional	328	“ Mr. Trent did n’t cancel . Some woman from your club called Friday afternoon and said something had come up . I ’d assumed it was you . ”
177788	177798	177779	177779	I	884	“ It was n’t me . Are you sure ? ”
177799	177808	177831	177832	Bubbly Professional	328	“ Yep . I took the call myself . ”
177847	177868	177842	177842	I	884	“ My mistake . Thank you and please apologize to Mr. Trent for any inconvenience it may have caused him . ”
177869	177872	177873	177873	her	2845	“ Honestly , ”
177884	177937	177878	177878	she	2845	“ this worked out better for him . He would have had to miss out on a daddy daughter dance if you ’d kept the Friday appointment , and Rachel ’s the type of girl that does n’t take disappointment well . So you kind of did him a favor by canceling . ”
178038	178043	178046	178046	her	2845	“ Be right there , ”
178095	178104	178105	178105	I	884	“ What are you doing here so early ? ”
178111	178117	178105	178105	I	884	“ Do you work tonight ? ”
178118	178124	178125	178125	She	2845	“ Nope . Off tonight . ”
178136	178147	178125	178125	She	2845	“ We could hang out later , if you want . ”
178148	178165	178105	178105	I	884	“ I do want . I have group at five - thirty . Maybe after that ? ”
178166	178206	178125	178125	She	2845	“ Groovy . I just had coffee with some friends next door . They want me to go to a concert with them so I came by to check out next week ’s schedule . Is it up yet ? ”
178207	178220	178105	178105	I	884	“ Yeah , I think I saw it . Come on up . ”
178282	178291	178299	178299	him	2853	“ Hi ! What are you doing here ? ”
178317	178325	178312	178312	His	2853	“ You need to come with me . ”
178326	178333	178334	178334	I	884	“ Why ? What ’s up ? ”
178363	178372	178373	178373	He	2853	“ Hey , are you mad at me ? ”
178402	178409	178410	178410	He	2853	“ Get your things and come . ”
178425	178433	178434	178434	Liesl	166	“ That bossy thing is so hot . ”
178510	178528	178501	178501	I	884	“ Hudson , I ’m not leaving just because you say so . I need more information . ”
178529	178539	178540	178540	He	2637	“ Alayna , I ’m not doing this here . ”
178552	178563	178544	178544	I	884	“ You will get your things and come . Now . ”
178736	178761	178732	178732	I	884	“ I , I have an employee here and I ’m the only other person here . David ’s not due in until five . ”
178762	178769	178770	178770	Liesl	166	“ It ’s fine , Laynie . ”
178791	178804	178779	178779	I	884	“ I got what I needed . I ’ll leave with you . ”
178869	178895	178850	178850	I	884	“ I need to close everything up . I unlocked the bar when I got a soft drink earlier and the computers are still up — ”
178912	178937	178940	178940	he	332	“ Text David and tell him I required you to leave on short notice . Alarm the main door . It ’ll be fine . ”
178943	178950	178940	178940	he	332	“ I doubt David will care . ”
179003	179008	178998	178998	I	884	“ Uh - huh , ”
179069	179089	179062	179062	Liesl	166	“ I ’ll take a rain check on that girls ’ night out . Have fun with Mr. Dominant . ”
179229	179232	179222	179222	he	2864	“ for sport ”
179532	179538	179539	179539	I	884	“ What ’s going on ? ”
179545	179548	179539	179539	I	884	“ Hudson ? ”
179549	179560	179564	179564	his	676	“ I ’m not ready to talk about this yet . ”
179659	179686	179653	179653	I	884	“ Whatever it is I did , I ’m sorry . I ’m sorry and I ’ll do whatever I have to do to fix it . ”
179702	179716	179691	179691	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , I ca n’t talk about this while I ’m driving . ”
179731	179747	179717	179717	He	676	“ Yeah , good idea . Focus on the road because you ’re scaring me . ”
179757	179766	179750	179750	he	676	“ Good . Maybe you should be scared . ”
179942	179966	179967	179967	His	676	“ Tell me one thing . One thing and think carefully before you answer because I want to believe what you tell me . ”
179986	179995	179967	179967	His	676	“ Are you still in love with him ? ”
180066	180081	180082	180082	Hudson	1556	“ No , I ’m not . I was never in love with him . ”
180109	180127	180097	180097	he	180	“ Then whatever it was — attraction , obsession . Do you still feel that for him ? ”
180128	180149	180150	180150	I	884	“ I never felt any of that for him . He was safe . We messed around a few times . ”
180158	180188	180150	180150	I	884	“ That ’s really the extent of it . Really and truly . He was just a guy I had chemistry with but not enough to drive me crazy . ”
180197	180207	180150	180150	I	884	“ Then why did he file a restraining order ? ”
180223	180232	180221	180221	Dizzy	336	“ Wait , who are you talking about ? ”
180284	180288	180280	180280	he	379	“ Paul Kresh . ”
180289	180292	180293	180293	I	884	“ Oh . ”
180300	180303	180293	180293	I	884	“ Oh . ”
180321	180328	180311	180311	I	884	“ You found out about Paul . ”
180342	180373	180337	180337	he	379	“ Since you know I ’m already aware of your past with Paul , you must be referring to the fact that he ’s a partner in Party Planners Plus . ”
180379	180385	180374	180374	I	884	“ You did n’t know ? ”
180422	180440	180374	180374	I	884	“ Well , he ’s not technically a partner , so that ’s not a fair question . ”
180441	180504	180528	180528	He	379	“ Dammit , Alayna . Do n’t hedge around the facts . Because I ’d like to think that you would never do something so stupid as to sign a deal that would put you in close working proximity with someone that you are legally not supposed to be anywhere near . The Alayna I know would never do something so brainless . ”
180518	180527	180506	180506	I	884	“ Guess you do n’t really know me . ”
180537	180545	180528	180528	He	379	“ This is not a fucking game ! ”
180546	180555	180556	180556	I	884	“ Do n’t you think I know that ? ”
180564	180583	180556	180556	I	884	“ I ’m the one who has the restraining order . I get the seriousness of the situation . ”
180607	180611	180612	180612	His	379	“ Then why ? ”
180617	180650	180612	180612	His	379	“ You ca n’t have been that desperate to sign a deal . I had thought — I’d hoped — that you did n’t realize that Kresh was engaged to Julie Swaggert — ”
180651	180661	180665	180665	his	379	“ Engaged ? I thought they were just dating . ”
180680	180734	180676	180676	I	884	“ Which does n’t matter , I know . I did n’t mean to seem interested , because I ’m not . I ’m not , Hudson . I do n’t care what or whom he ’s with . It ’s only that he did n’t say they were engaged when we talked . ”
180735	180741	180665	180665	his	379	“ You talked to him ? ”
180758	180775	180676	180676	I	884	“ So help me god , Alayna , you better say it was on the phone . ”
180802	180812	180795	180795	I	884	“ It was n’t . It was in person . ”
180829	180841	180813	180813	He	379	“ Dammit , Alayna ! What the fuck were you thinking ? ”
180842	180852	180857	180857	he	379	“ Stop yelling at me and I ’ll explain . ”
180909	180914	180915	180915	His	379	“ I ’m waiting . ”
180930	180946	180915	180915	His	379	“ I ’m not saying anything until you calm down . You ’re scaring me . ”
180956	180961	180947	180947	He	379	“ That ’s fair . ”
180970	180983	180962	180962	He	379	“ But this is as calm as I ’m going to get . ”
180987	181026	180984	180984	I	884	“ I , um , had the meeting with Julia . On Thursday . And I did n’t know she was involved with Paul . But then at the end he showed up and I was totally unprepared . ”
181049	181098	181045	181045	I	884	“ He acted like he did n’t know me so I followed his lead . And then when Julia went off to the bathroom , Paul told me he did n’t want to ruin the deal for her and so we had to pretend we ’d never met . ”
181117	181159	181160	181160	I	884	“ I told him I could n’t work with him , Hudson , and he said I had to . He said Julia was dying to work with Pierce Industries and this was her in and if I screwed it up … ”
181168	181175	181160	181160	I	884	“ He said I owed him . ”
181176	181187	181188	181188	His	884	“ Alayna , you do n’t fucking owe him anything . ”
181202	181211	181198	181198	My	884	“ I do ! I ruined his life . ”
181212	181225	181160	181160	I	884	“ He cheated on his fiancée . He ruined his own life . ”
181226	181241	181198	181198	My	884	“ But there ’s more to it than that , and you know it . ”
181242	181265	181160	181160	I	884	“ You still do n’t owe him shit . You were sick . You were n’t responsible for what you were doing . ”
181304	181354	181355	181355	I	884	“ It does n’t matter . Even if I do n’t owe him , he has this over my head . He could say that I set up the meeting simply to get to him . I mean , I did n’t , but it could look that way . ”
181359	181399	181355	181355	I	884	“ Even you thought that I did . And then he was there again that night at the Botanic Gardens . It looks like I could have been following him . Who ’s going to believe me over him ? ”
181413	181427	181408	181408	I	884	“ If I violate that order again , I could see jail time . ”
181449	181452	181453	181453	He	884	“ Alayna . ”
181540	181571	181533	181533	Hudson	1556	“ Why did n’t you come to me ? I would never let anything bad happen to you . Never . You have to know that , do n’t you ? ”
181591	181612	181616	181616	he	884	“ I got scared . Of what he could do to me . Of what he could do to you . ”
181632	181649	181616	181616	he	884	“ And I wanted you to be proud of me . Of the deal I made . ”
181670	181682	181667	181667	he	884	“ I ’m always proud of you , Alayna . Always . ”
181700	181735	181689	181689	I	884	“ I should have told you . I ’m so sorry . I did n’t know what to do and I wanted to tell you . Please , do n’t be mad at me . ”
181742	181752	181738	181738	he	884	“ Do n’t . Do n’t cry , precious . ”
181768	181821	181765	181765	he	884	“ I ’m only mad because you put yourself in danger . You scared me . You ca n’t imagine what I felt when the background report came across my desk and I realized the situation . Do n’t you know I could n’t stand it if anything bad happened to you ? ”
181826	181832	181765	181765	he	884	“ Yes , I know . ”
181846	181859	181765	181765	he	884	“ And I ’m mad because you did n’t come to me . ”
181860	181871	181872	181872	I	884	“ I wanted to . I did . But Ce — ”
181901	181919	181884	181884	I	884	“ But I did n’t want you to have to get in the middle of my mess . ”
181955	181961	181962	181962	he	884	“ Do n’t be silly , ”
181970	182001	181962	181962	he	884	“ First of all , I own The Sky Launch so I ’m legally responsible for anything that goes on in regards to employees and the people they interact with . ”
182021	182083	182009	182009	He	884	“ But more importantly , if you ’re in a mess of any sort , then so am I. Not legally . But because you ’re mine . And I ’m yours . And that means I ’m tied to you in every way . Good and bad . If you ca n’t see that , then we have no chance . ”
182109	182116	182086	182086	god	802	“ I really fucked everything up . ”
182125	182132	182086	182086	god	802	“ Oh , god , Hudson . ”
182146	182164	182133	182133	He	884	“ You did n’t fuck everything up . I can fix it . Now that I know . ”
182165	182171	182172	182172	I	884	“ What will you do ? ”
182202	182218	182221	182221	he	884	“ I would n’t do anything illegal , if that ’s what you ’re thinking . ”
182228	182280	182221	182221	he	884	“ I ’ll offer Party Planners Plus a deal with Fierce in exchange for terminating the contract with The Sky Launch . Fierce is a bigger name and can offer a better payout . They ’ll still be working with the Pierce name . Kresh will have nothing to complain about . ”
182281	182288	182301	182301	he	884	“ Good plan . Thank you . ”
182332	182356	182324	182324	My	884	“ I ’m sorry , Hudson . I ’m sorry you have to clean up my mess . I ’m such an idiot . ”
182357	182361	182362	182362	His	884	“ Shush up . ”
182383	182417	182362	182362	His	884	“ Stop feeling guilty . It ’s our mess , remember ? And I want to clean it up . It ’s one of the things I ’m capable of . Let me . ”
182418	182422	182423	182423	I	884	“ All right . ”
182440	182449	182423	182423	I	884	“ All right , I ’ll let you . ”
182472	182486	182452	182452	Hudson	1556	“ Now , Alayna . What else do you need to tell me ? ”
182487	182495	182496	182496	I	884	“ What — what do you mean ? ”
182544	182563	182564	182564	His	884	“ When we started this conversation , you thought I was talking about something else . Someone else . ”
182569	182579	182564	182564	His	884	“ Who did you think I was talking about ? ”
182587	182596	182582	182582	I	884	“ I thought you were talking about David . ”
182597	182601	182564	182564	His	884	“ David Lindt ? ”
182602	182605	182582	182582	I	884	“ Yes . ”
182625	182637	182617	182617	I	884	“ You told me there was nothing between you and David . ”
182638	182645	182606	182606	He	884	“ There ’s not . Anymore . ”
182646	182651	182617	182617	I	884	“ But there was . ”
182652	182655	182606	182606	He	884	“ Yes . ”
182725	182768	182716	182716	he	884	“ It was nothing , Hudson . We were sort of together . But not really . We did n’t go on dates or anything or tell anyone about us . Just , when we worked late , alone … things happened . ”
182777	182784	182716	182716	he	884	“ Did you sleep with him ? ”
182785	182794	182716	182716	he	884	“ No . Things never went that far . ”
182808	182829	182716	182716	he	884	“ You ’ve asked me this before and I told you no then as well . I was n’t lying . ”
182837	182854	182830	182830	He	884	“ I also asked if you had wanted to and I never got a straight answer . ”
182855	182863	182864	182864	I	884	“ I do n’t know the answer . ”
182887	182904	182907	182907	I	884	“ Yes . I suppose I did . Once upon a time . But not now . ”
182923	182937	182916	182916	I	884	“ There ’s nothing now , Hudson . You have to believe me . ”
182948	182952	182945	182945	he	884	“ I do . ”
182953	182957	182958	182958	I	884	“ You do ? ”
182968	182984	182945	182945	he	884	“ Yes . You do n’t look at him the way you look at me . ”
182985	182993	182945	182945	he	884	“ Of course , I do n’t . ”
182994	183016	182945	182945	he	884	“ But he looks at you the way I look at you . The way I imagine I look at you . ”
183017	183024	182945	182945	he	884	“ No , he does n’t . ”
183046	183051	183041	183041	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re exaggerating . ”
183058	183075	183052	183052	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m not . It ’s a problem and I ca n’t have it continuing . ”
183076	183082	183083	183083	I	884	“ What does that mean ? ”
183102	183116	183052	183052	Hudson	1556	“ It means he ’s going to have to leave The Sky Launch . ”
183117	183123	183126	183126	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t even joke . ”
183133	183142	183052	183052	Hudson	1556	“ Does it seem like I ’m joking ? ”
183143	183154	183155	183155	My	884	“ Hudson , no . You ca n’t do that . ”
183183	183223	183181	183181	me	884	“ You ca n’t fire David because of a stupid fling we had before I even met you . He ’s the responsible one at the club . He ’s the one who said we needed to end it . ”
183231	183239	183224	183224	His	2899	“ You are n’t helping your case . ”
183240	183272	183273	183273	I	884	“ But you ca n’t fire David because we messed around once upon a time . It ’s over . It ’s not fair . It ’s not fair to David . ”
183301	183316	183291	183291	Hudson	1556	“ It was going to happen anyway . Regardless of what you and he ... ”
183404	183417	183399	183399	I	884	“ What do you mean by it was going to happen anyway ? ”
183434	183476	183418	183418	He	2899	“ This is n’t how I wanted to tell you . It was meant to be a surprise at an appropriate time . But the truth is that I ’ve wanted to make a management change since I bought the place . ”
183497	183508	183418	183418	He	2899	“ Alayna , I want you to run the club . ”
183509	183514	183418	183418	He	2899	“ Hudson … no . ”
183515	183523	183418	183418	He	2899	“ I bought the club for you . ”
183530	183548	183528	183528	me	884	“ What are you talking about ? You did n’t know me when you bought the club . ”
183549	183553	183418	183418	He	2899	“ The symposium — ”
183559	183591	183554	183554	I	884	“ You told me you were already looking at the club . The fact that I worked there influenced you . Never did you say anything about buying it for me . ”
183690	183706	183717	183717	He	884	“ I did n’t tell you because I did n’t want to seem too forward . ”
183707	183716	183717	183717	He	884	“ Well , too fucking late for that . ”
183726	183811	183717	183717	He	884	“ It was n’t as insane as it sounds , Alayna . It was business . I saw you at the symposium and knew I needed you working for me . Since you were n’t taking any interviews with companies , I had to buy the company you were already at . Yes , I was attracted to you . Yes , it influenced my decision to pursue your talent , but wanting you working for me was the driving force of that pursuit . ”
183838	183867	183868	183868	I	884	“ Then you got what you wanted . I am working for you . I do n’t have to run The Sky Launch to be working for you . ”
183883	183900	183868	183868	I	884	“ I have an important role , and I do n’t need anything more right now . ”
183912	183921	183901	183901	He	2906	“ Alayna , you have so much potential ! ”
183922	183964	183965	183965	My	884	“ Stop it ! You sound like my brother . Do n’t decide that I ’m wasting my potential . I ’m building up to it at my own speed . I ’m not ready to run a club , Hudson . ”
183991	184016	183988	183988	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re going to have to be ready . Otherwise someone else will have to step into that role when David ’s gone . ”
184017	184042	183988	183988	Hudson	1556	“ Then this is n’t about me at all ! It is about David . You ca n’t fire him . You ca n’t ! ”
184043	184056	183988	183988	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s about you , Alayna . No one but you . ”
184073	184125	183988	183988	Hudson	1556	“ I told you I do n’t share . I wo n’t share you . Not with him . Not with anyone . I will bend over backwards to give you everything you need and want , but this is the one thing I have to have in return . Fidelity . ”
184126	184160	183988	183988	Hudson	1556	“ I am faithful . I ’ve never been anything but faithful . I have no desire to cheat on you with David or anyone . I ’m yours , like you said . ”
184161	184188	183988	183988	Hudson	1556	“ Yes . You are . Mine . And I should have gotten rid of him the minute I suspected there had been anything between you . ”
184202	184213	184193	184193	he	2907	“ In other words , you do n’t trust me . ”
184214	184221	183988	183988	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t trust him ! ”
184222	184238	184193	184193	he	2907	“ It does n’t matter if you trust him as long as you trust me ! ”
184252	184284	184239	184239	His	2907	“ Today I discovered you kept both your relationship with David and your recent interaction with Paul Kresh from me and you ’re talking about trust ? Good timing , Alayna . ”
184299	184349	184292	184292	David	180	“ I told you why I did n’t tell you about Paul . And this is why I did n’t tell you about David . Because I was afraid you ’d overreact , and wow , here you are trying to fire the best employee The Sky Launch has ! ”
184350	184361	184285	184285	Ouch	223	“ You ’re the best employee The Sky Launch has . ”
184374	184397	184366	184366	his	180	“ I beg to differ . I would n’t be worth shit without David , and I do n’t want his job . ”
184406	184431	184398	184398	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s not an option . You want to work at the club , you ’ll work in the position that I choose . ”
184437	184470	184398	184398	Hudson	1556	“ Then I quit ! Because I ca n’t work for someone who ’s so obviously jealous and controlling . And you ’re seriously making me reconsider my living situation as well . ”
184471	184475	184476	184476	He	180	“ Do n’t ! ”
184485	184501	184476	184476	He	180	“ Do n’t throw our relationship on the line because of a good business decision . ”
184601	184621	184594	184594	I	884	“ You are n’t making this decision because it ’s good business . You ’re trying to punish me . ”
184626	184637	184622	184622	His	180	“ I ’m punishing you by giving you a promotion ? ”
184638	184646	184594	184594	I	884	“ A promotion I do n’t want ! ”
184687	184714	184680	184680	he	180	“ You want me to take everything from you , but you wo n’t take from me ? How am I supposed to feel about that ? ”
184715	184722	184723	184723	He	180	“ This is n’t the same . ”
184762	184777	184756	184756	I	884	“ I do n’t want this , Hudson . I do n’t want it ! ”
184838	184844	184829	184829	I	884	“ Let go of me ! ”
184845	184855	184856	184856	He	180	“ No . I ’ll never let you go . ”
185038	185060	185032	185032	He	180	“ God , you are so maddening . How can I want you so much when you drive me so insane ? ”
185209	185219	185204	185204	He	180	“ It does n’t mean I ’m not mad . ”
185275	185278	185279	185279	he	180	“ Fine , ”
185298	185319	185279	185279	he	180	“ Be mad . Take it out on me . I ’m planning to take out my emotions on you . ”
185504	185509	185510	185510	he	180	“ Look at me , ”
185521	185527	185528	185528	I	884	“ Ca n’t you see ? ”
185538	185559	185528	185528	I	884	“ Ca n’t you see what you do to me ? Ca n’t you see how you make me feel ? ”
185574	185584	185560	185560	He	180	“ Do you feel how hard you make me ? ”
185613	185617	185606	185606	he	180	“ Do you ? ”
185618	185621	185622	185622	I	884	“ Yes , ”
185643	185652	185626	185626	He	180	“ You do this to me , Alayna . ”
185734	185775	185726	185726	he	180	“ Even when you ’re petulant and contrary , I still want you . Always , I want you . I want to give you everything . All of me . Why ca n’t you take it ? Take it . ”
185796	185800	185776	185776	He	180	“ Take it ! ”
186007	186015	186016	186016	His	180	“ Now , come on , Alayna . ”
186020	186032	186016	186016	His	180	“ You ca n’t tell me you did n’t enjoy it . ”
186041	186056	186033	186033	His	180	“ Sex is n’t the only way to show a person how you feel . ”
186057	186069	186033	186033	His	180	“ I know . I tried to give you a nightclub . ”
186095	186125	186081	186081	I	884	“ If you want to continue fighting about this , which I ’m sure you do , it will have to be later . I have work to do . ”
187203	187209	187210	187210	I	884	“ Make love to me , ”
187220	187228	187210	187210	I	884	“ Please . Make love to me . ”
187592	187606	187570	187570	He	680	“ Do you mind sharing , or do you want your own suitcase ? ”
187615	187622	187607	187607	I	884	“ Um , suitcase for what ? ”
187623	187627	187570	187570	He	680	“ For Japan . ”
187637	187647	187628	187628	I	884	“ Japan ? Why would I go to Japan ? ”
187648	187669	187607	187607	I	884	“ Because I ’m going to make that play for Plexis . And I want you to come with me . ”
187715	187722	187723	187723	Hudson	1556	“ When exactly is this happening ? ”
187763	187792	187755	187755	He	680	“ The plane ’s set to take off late tonight . It ’s a long flight . Might as well sleep . Or , we could not sleep . ”
187798	187817	187793	187793	His	680	“ It would be easier to adjust to the time difference if we stayed awake the entire flight . ”
187826	187840	187793	187793	His	680	“ I ’m sure we could think of something to occupy our time . ”
187860	187869	187845	187845	I	884	“ I ca n’t go to Japan tonight . ”
187870	187874	187793	187793	His	680	“ Why not ? ”
187875	187881	187882	187882	I	884	“ Because I have work , ”
187927	187933	187918	187918	I	884	“ So what about work ? ”
187947	187997	187936	187936	we	2930	“ I have work . You know ? That thing you do where you go someplace and make lots of money ? Even those of us who do n’t make lots of money still do the work part . In fact , it ’s even more necessary for us . ”
187998	188012	187936	187936	we	2930	“ Anything you need , I can provide . I expect to provide . ”
188057	188079	188043	188043	I	884	“ Hey , we just moved in together . Can we step back and keep this on the topic at hand ? ”
188080	188093	188107	188111	this man doing to me	2932	“ Fine . But that discussion will come eventually . Sometime soon . ”
188113	188120	188121	188121	His	884	“ You make your own schedule . ”
188162	188181	188212	188212	He	884	“ Because I make my own schedule does n’t mean I can leave on a moment ’s notice . ”
188182	188192	188212	188212	He	884	“ Sure you can . I own the club . ”
188193	188211	188212	188212	He	884	“ Funny how you pretend you do n’t until it ’s convenient for you to remind me . ”
188219	188233	188234	188234	I	884	“ And do n’t think we ’re done talking about the club management . ”
188269	188288	188259	188259	He	884	“ I did n’t think that for a minute . But right now we ’re talking about Japan . ”
188289	188307	188259	188259	He	884	“ I have a meeting set up with Aaron Trent tomorrow . I ca n’t miss that . ”
188308	188318	188259	188259	He	884	“ Reschedule . He ’ll make time for you . ”
188319	188325	188326	188326	I	884	“ That ’s so tacky . ”
188353	188361	188336	188336	I	884	“ He already thinks I rescheduled once . ”
188362	188374	188259	188259	He	884	“ Why ? I thought it had been he who canceled ? ”
188375	188379	188380	188380	Hudson	1556	“ Long story . ”
188395	188405	188380	188380	Hudson	1556	“ And you ’re distracting me from my point . ”
188406	188416	188259	188259	He	884	“ I think you ’re the one distracting me . ”
188417	188435	188380	188380	Hudson	1556	“ They ’re put away , you sex fiend . You can surely find my eyes now . ”
188449	188458	188441	188441	he	700	“ Tell Trent something came up and reschedule . ”
188468	188482	188459	188459	He	700	“ He ’ll understand . I ’ll make him if I have to . ”
188483	188493	188494	188494	I	884	“ You know I want to handle him myself . ”
188570	188597	188553	188553	I	884	“ It ’s not only him , Hudson . I have other things I ’m working on . And I do n’t even have a passport . ”
188598	188605	188643	188643	Hudson	1556	“ I already have that arranged . ”
188606	188620	188621	188621	I	884	“ I do n’t even want to know how you pulled that off . ”
188653	188657	188658	188658	He	700	“ Thank you . ”
188706	188739	188692	188692	I	884	“ Also , my brother ’s coming out from Boston sometime this week . I need to get him the key to my apartment and let him harass me for some reason . ”
188755	188776	188740	188740	Hudson	1556	“ I can arrange for someone to meet him , you know . It does n’t have to be you . ”
188816	188832	188811	188811	I	884	“ You seriously have a solution for any protest I make , do n’t you ? ”
188833	188847	188811	188811	I	884	“ I guarantee that I do . So why are you still protesting ? ”
188848	188860	188811	188811	I	884	“ Because I have a life that involves more than you . ”
188861	188866	188811	188811	I	884	“ I hate that . ”
188884	188890	188867	188867	I	884	“ Do n’t be cute . ”
188891	188910	188914	188914	his	2937	“ I want you with me . I ’ll use any tactic I can to make that happen . ”
189004	189034	188990	188990	he	2937	“ I may be gone for several days . I ca n’t bear to be apart from you that long . It kills me that you think you can . ”
189233	189255	189256	189256	I	884	“ I do n’t want to be apart from you either , Hudson . I … can I think about it ? ”
189284	189288	189277	189277	He	2937	“ I suppose . ”
189302	189310	189291	189291	he	2937	“ When do you need a decision ? ”
189311	189327	189291	189291	he	2937	“ Any time before the plane leaves the runway . Say , ten - ish . ”
189328	189348	189291	189291	he	2937	“ Okay . I ’ll think about it and let you know by this evening . Does that work ? ”
189349	189353	189354	189354	He	2937	“ It does . ”
189370	189411	189354	189354	He	2937	“ You know , every time you say you need to think about something , you end up coming around to my way in the end . When are you going to learn to just say yes to begin with ? ”
189415	189419	189412	189412	I	884	“ Not today . ”
189420	189427	189354	189354	He	2937	“ It was worth a try . ”
189520	189531	189517	189517	my	884	“ Thank you for last night . It was beautiful . ”
189532	189537	189538	189538	He	2937	“ That it was . ”
189545	189550	189538	189538	He	2937	“ Very much so . ”
189581	189586	189587	189587	He	2937	“ That ’s enough . ”
189619	189633	189605	189605	he	2937	“ So I ’m guessing you are n’t going straight to the club . ”
189651	189674	189634	189634	I	884	“ I thought I ’d get a run in first . A real run , outdoors . Before it gets too hot . ”
189675	189679	189680	189680	He	2937	“ Good idea . ”
189690	189698	189680	189680	He	2937	“ I have an early meeting myself . ”
189699	189711	189712	189712	He	2937	“ I figured . You are n’t usually dressed this early . ”
189742	189763	189764	189764	He	2937	“ Trust me , precious , if I did n’t have other plans , I would definitely not be dressed . ”
189783	189797	189769	189769	he	2937	“ And you would n’t need to get your exercise with a run . ”
189798	189807	189769	189769	he	2937	“ So sure you ’d score , huh ? ”
189813	189818	189808	189808	He	2937	“ Would n’t I ? ”
189819	189823	189824	189824	He	2937	“ You would . ”
189892	189899	189884	189884	His	2937	“ Do you hide everything there ? ”
189906	189929	189900	189900	I	884	“ It ’s pretty handy if you ask me . They should build pockets into bras . I guarantee they ’d sell . ”
189930	189940	189900	189900	I	884	“ That can be our next business venture together . ”
189974	189985	189900	189900	I	884	“ I ’m ready to go down . Are you ? ”
189991	190001	189986	189986	He	2937	“ Go down to the lobby , you pervert . ”
190002	190018	190019	190019	He	2937	“ No , I need to answer a few emails first . Go on ahead . ”
190034	190038	190019	190019	He	2937	“ Hold on . ”
190094	190097	190098	190098	he	2937	“ What ? ”
190108	190128	190085	190085	He	2937	“ You ’re so … I do n’t know … sweet this morning . What ’s up with you ? ”
190129	190137	190085	190085	He	2937	“ I suppose I ’m simply happy . ”
190138	190146	190147	190147	I	884	“ I ’m glad . Really glad . ”
190175	190198	190162	190162	his	2937	“ Hey , I meant it when I said we ’re not finished with the discussion about management at The Sky Launch . ”
190199	190223	190224	190224	I	884	“ Persistent little vixen , are n’t you ? We ’ll have plenty of time to discuss it on our flight to Japan . ”
190227	190234	190235	190235	I	884	“ Now who ’s being persistent ? ”
190241	190252	190235	190235	I	884	“ We ’ll talk later . About all of it . ”
190263	190266	190258	190258	his	2937	“ Alayna . ”
190292	190303	190279	190279	He	2937	“ Why did you … come to me last night ? ”
190375	190384	190363	190363	I	884	“ It ’s sort of hard to explain . ”
190385	190390	190391	190391	I	884	“ Would you try ? ”
190411	190447	190391	190391	I	884	“ I was unpacking . And I do n’t know why I had n’t noticed it before , but I realized the books you ordered — and the DVDs — that they were for me . ”
190454	190472	190448	190448	His	2937	“ I told you they were yours . You know I prefer to read on my Kindle . ”
190473	190518	190448	190448	His	2937	“ No , I mean , that they were the books I wanted to read . That you ’d thought very specifically about what I wanted . It made me feel good . Made me feel loved . Made me feel loved by you . ”
190519	190522	190523	190523	He	2937	“ Oh . ”
190536	190545	190546	190546	He	2937	“ Well , yes . Good , then . ”
190561	190576	190546	190546	He	2937	“ Wow . I had no idea I had the power to fluster you . ”
190587	190595	190577	190577	His	2937	“ Do n’t get used to it . ”
190800	190821	190828	190828	I	884	“ I ’m headed into the city . I ’ll be at the Waldorf . What time can we meet ? ”
190822	190827	190838	190838	he	180	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
190894	190903	190879	190879	I	884	“ Nothing . Just overwhelmed with … stuff . ”
190960	190971	190972	190972	I	884	“ I moved out of my apartment this past weekend , ”
190983	191011	190972	190972	I	884	“ And my brother wants to meet with me to get my key . But we ’re not getting along . Not since I started dating Hudson . ”
191012	191015	191016	191016	His	180	“ Hmm . ”
191073	191081	191061	191061	He	180	“ So you moved in with Pierce ? ”
191094	191098	191082	191082	I	884	“ I did . ”
191131	191139	191168	191168	His	180	“ I know . It was fast . ”
191140	191149	191168	191168	His	180	“ That ’s not what I was thinking . ”
191150	191156	191168	191168	His	180	“ What were you thinking ? ”
191157	191167	191168	191168	His	180	“ I was thinking I should have been faster . ”
191233	191241	191242	191242	He	180	“ Sorry . That was uncalled for . ”
191253	191264	191242	191242	He	180	“ Anyway , congratulations . I ’m happy for you . ”
191272	191281	191265	191265	I	884	“ I ’m happy for me , too . ”
191317	191334	191312	191312	I	884	“ And I ’m stressed . Hudson wants me to go to Japan with him tonight . ”
191371	191381	191382	191384	Usually closing managers	2963	“ Why are you here so late , anyway ? ”
191397	191412	191394	191394	He	180	“ Waiting for you . And , yeah , Hudson told me about Japan . ”
191420	191425	191413	191413	I	884	“ What ? When ? ”
191450	191470	191413	191413	I	884	“ About an hour or so ago . He wanted to make sure we ’d be covered without you . ”
191490	191498	191471	191471	Hudson	1556	“ I have n’t said yes yet . ”
191499	191504	191505	191505	He	180	“ But you will . ”
191528	191538	191517	191517	I	884	“ Is that the only reason Hudson called you ? ”
191548	191560	191539	191539	David	180	“ Actually , he did n’t call . He stopped by . ”
191561	191572	191573	191573	Hudson	1556	“ To tell you he ’s taking me to Japan ? ”
191600	191609	191573	191573	Hudson	1556	“ No , to discuss some other things . ”
191616	191625	191626	191626	I	884	“ Oh , really ? Like what things ? ”
191719	191739	191699	191699	He	180	“ He said he ’s transferring the Party Planners deal to Fierce . Something about a conflict of interest . ”
191761	191771	191772	191772	David	180	“ He took all the copies of the contract . ”
191781	191791	191772	191772	David	180	“ But he said you already knew all that . ”
191792	191798	191799	191799	Boy	192	“ Yeah , I did . ”
191803	191811	191772	191772	David	180	“ Sorry , you lost your deal . ”
191845	191875	191891	191891	they	2965	“ Nah , it ’s fine . The more I got to know about the company , the more I realized it was n’t a good fit after all . ”
191895	191906	191907	191907	I	884	“ And that ’s all you and Hudson talked about ? ”
191913	191925	191907	191907	I	884	“ There ’s more , I can tell from your face . ”
191954	191996	191932	191932	David	180	“ Well , I ’m not supposed to tell you this until you get back from Japan , but I do n’t feel good keeping a secret from you . Plus , I ’m really excited and have to tell someone . ”
191997	192002	192003	192003	My	884	“ What is it ? ”
192021	192028	192029	192029	His	180	“ He offered me a promotion . ”
192037	192049	192029	192029	His	180	“ General Manager at Adora , his club in Atlantic City . ”
192071	192078	192060	192060	I	884	“ What did you tell him ? ”
192098	192113	192060	192060	I	884	“ I said , hell yes . Adora ? That place is world famous . ”
192184	192207	192169	192169	I	884	“ But we ’re only getting started here . The Sky Launch could be the next Adora . With you and me — ”
192208	192264	192265	192265	He	180	“ I ’m sure it will be the next Adora . Bigger even , with Pierce ’s money and your ideas . But I ’m not a guy who builds things . I ’m a guy who runs things someone else has built . Adora is the biggest career move I could ever hope for . ”
192272	192282	192265	192265	He	180	“ I ’m supposed to start in two weeks . ”
192283	192299	192300	192300	My	884	“ That ’s so soon . And you ’ll have to move to Atlantic City . ”
192306	192325	192326	192326	His	180	“ If I did n’t know any better , I ’d say you ’re going to miss me . ”
192331	192343	192344	192344	I	884	“ Of course , I ’ll miss you , you dope . ”
192357	192382	192344	192344	I	884	“ You ’ve been such a great manager . It was really you who inspired me to want to stay in the nightclub business . ”
192383	192391	192392	192392	He	180	“ Really ? I had no idea . ”
192399	192427	192392	192392	He	180	“ I ’ll miss you , Laynie . And not just because I have a big crush on you , but because you ’re a good friend . ”
192472	192483	192463	192463	I	884	“ You do n’t have a big crush on me . ”
192484	192497	192459	192459	my	884	“ You ’re right . I ’m totally in love with you . ”
192615	192620	192621	192621	David	180	“ I get it , ”
192624	192639	192621	192621	David	180	“ I just really needed you to know how I feel before I go . ”
192647	192671	192640	192640	I	884	“ And now you realize that I really have to do this . I ca n’t stay here with you . And Adora … ”
192681	192721	192640	192640	I	884	“ But I ’m only a phone call away . You can dial me up anytime you need anything . Like , if you have questions about The Sky Launch , or if you want to hear my voice . ”
192734	192745	192722	192722	I	884	“ Did he tell you who was taking your place ? ”
192746	192757	192758	192758	He	2967	“ He hinted . We both know it ’s you . ”
192765	192781	192758	192758	He	2967	“ Come on , we knew it was coming the minute you started seeing him . ”
192782	192798	192799	192799	My	884	“ No , I did n’t know it was coming . I really did n’t . ”
192869	192887	192888	192888	David	180	“ I ’m not saying it ’s unwarranted . You deserve to run the club . Truly . ”
192968	192988	192959	192959	I	884	“ Hey , I just remembered that I need to stop and pick up the new sample menu design . ”
192989	192998	192959	192959	I	884	“ I thought Graphic Front was emailing it . ”
193012	193022	193023	193023	I	884	“ They are . I mean , they did . ”
193030	193057	193023	193023	I	884	“ I want to see it printed . Feel the weight and all that . Anyway , I ’m not sure when I ’ll be back . ”
193061	193073	193058	193058	David	180	“ I ’m really not the one you report to anymore . ”
193082	193087	193074	193074	I	884	“ Hug it out ? ”
193108	193117	193095	193095	I	884	“ Thank you , David . For everything . ”
193172	193186	193153	193153	he	180	“ And congratulations . I ’m glad things are working out for you . ”
193260	193264	193265	193265	Trish	9246	“ Ms. Withers ! ”
193306	193314	193315	193315	he	2970	“ Hold on a moment , Landon , ”
193327	193334	193321	193321	He	2970	“ It ’s okay , Patricia . ”
193353	193365	193366	193366	I	884	“ Finish your phone call and meet me in the loft . ”
193379	193391	193366	193366	I	884	“ And so you know , we ’re gon na fight . ”
193544	193559	193535	193535	Hudson	1556	“ He was n’t supposed to tell you until we got back from Japan . ”
193595	193616	193591	193591	me	884	“ Lucky for me , he ’s a good friend . Also , I never agreed to go to Japan . ”
193617	193620	193573	193573	he	821	“ Touché . ”
193621	193628	193629	193629	My	884	“ What the fuck , Hudson ? ”
193656	193668	193641	193641	He	821	“ I offered David an opportunity , and he took it . ”
193669	193678	193573	193573	he	821	“ You agreed we could discuss it further . ”
193679	193699	193641	193641	He	821	“ I agreed we could discuss the future management of The Sky Launch further , and we certainly will . ”
193715	193722	193700	193700	He	821	“ This was part of that ! ”
193723	193731	193732	193732	He	821	“ You should have been more specific . ”
193756	193807	193749	193749	I	884	“ You knew what I meant . You knew how I felt and you went ahead and ignored everything I said . I thought you cared about me , but you obviously do n’t , because that ’s not how you treat someone that you ’re in a relationship with . ”
193822	193882	193808	193808	He	821	“ Yes , I did know how you felt . And you knew how I felt . You wanted me not to fire him , I wanted him gone . Offering him a job elsewhere — a promotion , mind you at my biggest club in the country — was , I thought , a pretty damn good compromise . ”
193918	193938	193905	193905	Hudson	1556	“ Compromises are supposed to involve both parties . You alone ca n’t arbitrarily decide what the compromise is . ”
193939	193946	193947	193947	He	821	“ I did n’t , really . ”
193957	194002	193947	193947	He	821	“ David did when he accepted the job . I had no idea that he ’d agree when I asked him , and if he had n’t , then I would have come back to you to find a suitable solution to our problem . ”
194003	194019	193905	193905	Hudson	1556	“ You should have talked to me before you even offered the job to him ! ”
194020	194038	193947	193947	He	821	“ I took the opportunity when I saw it . You were n’t around to confer with . ”
194039	194060	194061	194061	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t even pretend you did n’t go to David today with every intention of making him that offer . ”
194094	194109	194087	194087	I	884	“ I ca n’t believe you do n’t see why this is n’t okay ! ”
194174	194190	194163	194163	Hudson	1556	“ Are you upset because you assume I want you to take David ’s place ? ”
194219	194264	194265	194265	His	2977	“ I do want you to , of course , and I have full confidence that you would do an excellent job . But if you are unwilling , then I hope you will be instrumental in deciding who will take his place instead . ”
194285	194314	194275	194275	I	884	“ Dammit , Hudson . I do n’t want anyone to take his place . I want to work with David . David Lindt , that ’s all . ”
194315	194345	194265	194265	His	2977	“ You ’re defending him with the passion of a lover , Alayna . You ’re making it hard for me to believe there really is nothing between you . ”
194374	194382	194383	194383	My	884	“ This is so manipulative , Hudson . ”
194393	194444	194383	194383	My	884	“ Everything you ’ve done and said to me today is a total mind game . I thought you were done with that . I do n’t even know how to react . Which is probably exactly what you were going for , so guess what — mission fucking accomplished . ”
194450	194520	194445	194445	He	884	“ It is not fair for you to throw my past behaviors in my face every time you disagree with my actions . I am in no way trying to manipulate you to do or feel anything . I ’m merely staying committed to my plan — to you , Alayna . Everything I ’ve done has been to protect our relationship and our future . That is all . ”
194521	194541	194588	194588	He	884	“ Really ? Because right now the future of our relationship feels pretty vulnerable , if you ask me . ”
194611	194641	194588	194588	He	884	“ Do n’t even come near me . You try to solve all our problems with sex , and this time is not going to be one of them . ”
194650	194683	194642	194642	He	884	“ I do not try to solve our problems with sex . I simply recognize that when we ’re fighting , the physical connection puts us back in tune with each other . ”
194684	194694	194695	194695	He	884	“ You mean it makes me easier to manage . ”
194716	194731	194707	194707	I	884	“ I ca n’t deal with this right now . I have to go . ”
194770	194780	194764	194764	He	884	“ Alayna , do not leave things like this . ”
194781	194799	194812	194812	his	884	“ Right now the last thing I want to hear is you telling me what to do . ”
194800	194805	194812	194812	his	884	“ Alayna , please — ”
194875	194900	194868	194868	his	884	“ I ’ll be at the penthouse later . That ’s all I can give you . Right now , I need some space . ”
194915	194919	194912	194912	him	884	“ Fair enough . ”
195010	195031	194976	194976	She	9246	“ Did you get my text ? I ’ll be at the Waldorf this afternoon . Need to see you . ”
195060	195073	195032	195033	Goddamn Brian	1286	“ Text me when you ’re in . I ’ll come by . ”
195089	195100	195084	195084	she	9246	“ Hey , it ’s Laynie . Are you busy ? ”
195101	195111	195084	195084	she	9246	“ Uh , sort of . What ’s up ? ”
195112	195121	195084	195084	she	9246	“ I , um , need to talk . ”
195126	195143	195084	195084	she	9246	“ Oh , no ! What ’s wrong ? You sound like you ’ve been crying . ”
195154	195169	195150	195150	I	884	“ I ’d rather talk in person . Are you free to meet up ? ”
195211	195226	195150	195150	I	884	“ I could do later . Like , this afternoon . Would that work ? ”
195227	195233	195234	195234	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
195250	195279	195234	195234	I	884	“ Let me think . I have to see my brother . Sometime this afternoon . Even though I do n’t want to . I do n’t know . ”
195312	195325	195306	195306	I	884	“ I ’m not really able to make any decisions right now . ”
195326	195337	195338	195338	Celia	9246	“ Okay , I get it . You ’re upset . ”
195345	195365	195338	195338	Celia	9246	“ You said your brother ’s in town ? Brian ? Is he staying with you at the penthouse ? ”
195366	195384	195306	195306	I	884	“ God , no . The Waldorf . It ’s Brian ’s favorite place in the world . ”
195385	195430	195338	195338	Celia	9246	“ I ’m doing a design install in the foyer at Fit Nation on Fifty - First . There ’s a coffee shop next door . How about we meet there around two ? You ’ll be close to the Waldorf , as well . ”
195448	195456	195438	195438	I	884	“ Perfect . Thank you , Celia . ”
195457	195460	195306	195306	I	884	“ Anytime . ”
195506	195510	195306	195306	I	884	“ Ms. Withers ? ”
195525	195543	195306	195306	I	884	“ Mr. Pierce suggested I drive you somewhere . To the penthouse or the club , perhaps ? ”
195602	195619	195595	195595	I	884	“ I do n’t want to be at the penthouse . The club , I suppose . ”
195972	195977	195978	195978	She	166	“ Hey , girl . ”
195994	196008	195978	195978	She	166	“ I was disappointed when I did n’t see you yesterday at group . ”
196019	196028	196009	196009	I	884	“ Sorry about that . Stuff came up . ”
196029	196049	196092	196092	She	166	“ The fact that you sought me out here leads me to believe that it was n’t good stuff . ”
196050	196069	196070	196070	I	884	“ Some of it was . Very good stuff . And some of it definitely not good stuff . ”
196083	196091	196070	196070	I	884	“ Do you have time to talk ? ”
196104	196119	196092	196092	She	166	“ As long as you do n’t mind me chowing down while you do . ”
196120	196124	196070	196070	I	884	“ Chow away . ”
196239	196262	196224	196224	Lauren	166	“ Well , that ’s quite a week of events . What have you learned by saying all of that out loud ? ”
196284	196290	196291	196291	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
196309	196326	196299	196299	I	884	“ I see my culpability in Hudson ’s betrayal . I kept secrets from him first . ”
196364	196371	196372	196372	God	8844	“ Very good . What else ? ”
196385	196418	196380	196380	I	884	“ I ’ve realized I do n’t know how to handle my feelings . I used to cling and obsess when I felt off . What am I supposed to do instead ? ”
196419	196432	196433	196433	Lauren	166	“ Exactly what you ’re doing . You deal with them constructively . ”
196448	196524	196433	196433	Lauren	166	“ Listen , honey , being healthy does n’t mean you do n’t feel things anymore . You will always feel things — good and bad , depending on the day , depending on the minute . That ’s called life . Being healthy is talking your emotions out , writing them down , realizing that you do n’t have to do anything to change them . Sometimes you just have to ride them out . ”
196525	196531	196566	196566	Lauren	166	“ Well , that sucks . ”
196532	196537	196538	196538	She	166	“ Does n’t it ? ”
196545	196565	196538	196538	She	166	“ There ’s something else I want to point out that I do n’t know if you ’re seeing . ”
196625	196630	196617	196617	I	884	“ What ’s that ? ”
196631	196647	196654	196654	she	166	“ Hudson — I do n’t know him personally , but his behavior sounds familiar . ”
196701	196716	196692	196692	I	884	“ You mean , he sounds like me . Like me in the past . ”
196717	196724	196725	196725	She	166	“ Jealous , manipulative , deceitful . ”
196750	196768	196769	196770	Reducing Hudson	1556	“ He ’s really not like that . You ’re making him sound worse than he is . ”
196784	196807	196808	196808	Lauren	166	“ I ’m not making him sound like anything . Those are attributes you used to use to describe yourself in therapy . ”
196813	196823	196808	196808	Lauren	166	“ Why do you think you were that way ? ”
196880	196911	196872	196872	I	884	“ Because I felt unloved . Because I was desperate to get the guy I wanted . Because I did n’t think there was any other way to get noticed . ”
196912	196930	196936	196936	His	884	“ Do you think those might be the same reasons Hudson ’s done what he ’s done ? ”
197031	197112	197026	197026	Lauren	166	“ Look , I ’m not validating his behavior . Or yours . It sounds like you both have a lot of work to do before you know how to function together . I ’m simply giving you some perspective . It seems you ’ve been able to connect with each other because you both come from similar places . Maybe you should use that experience to understand where he ’s coming from . It ’s a start , anyway . ”
197120	197130	197113	197113	My	884	“ So what — do I just forgive him ? ”
197131	197139	197140	197140	She	166	“ No . You could walk away . ”
197176	197194	197172	197172	Lauren	166	“ You probably should walk away . But I ’m sensing that ’s not in your plans . ”
197195	197222	197113	197113	My	884	“ No , I do n’t want to leave him . And it kills me that right now he probably thinks I ’m doing exactly that . ”
197226	197275	197223	197223	She	166	“ Then there ’s going to have to be forgiveness . It does n’t have to be unconditional , though . Tell him you understand him . Thank him for his good intentions . Then explain to him what will happen if he does anything like that again . ”
197276	197284	197348	197348	She	166	“ That does n’t sound too horrible . ”
197297	197336	197223	197223	She	166	“ Understand , though , that you ’ll have to be able to back up anything you say . If you say you ’ll leave him if he does it again , then you need to leave him . ”
197337	197347	197223	197223	She	166	“ I do n’t want to think about that . ”
197353	197387	197348	197348	She	166	“ I ’m sure you do n’t . Also , he could put conditions on you . If he finds out you ’re keeping more secrets , for example . He could walk . ”
197388	197404	197405	197405	I	884	“ Guess I better come clean on everything to him before any conditions are delivered . ”
197460	197470	197455	197455	Lauren	166	“ You have more you are n’t telling him ? ”
197471	197486	197487	197487	I	884	“ I know , I know . Do n’t look at me like that . ”
197499	197515	197487	197487	I	884	“ You think we ’re both fifty shades of fucked up , do n’t you ? ”
197516	197529	197534	197534	she	166	“ Nah , not that bad . Maybe twenty - five shades . ”
197739	197765	197731	197731	I	884	“ Hi , I ’m looking for Celia Werner . She ’s supposed to be doing some design work here . Have you seen her ? ”
197782	197787	197788	197788	His	3008	“ I know Celia . ”
197817	197829	197808	197810	Probably all men	3011	“ She has n’t been by at all today , though . ”
197830	197835	197836	197836	She	9246	“ Are you sure ? ”
197849	197852	197808	197810	Probably all men	3011	“ Positive . ”
197853	197856	197861	197861	me	884	“ Huh . ”
197975	197982	197964	197964	Jordan	655	“ Take me to The Bowery . ”
198236	198244	198245	198245	I	884	“ Why would Celia make it up ? ”
198308	198316	198317	198317	Jack	10551	“ Because that ’s what she does . ”
198323	198343	198317	198317	Jack	10551	“ Ah , and many of these questions can now be settled because the subject at hand has arrived . ”
198361	198367	198353	198353	I	884	“ What ’s going on ? ”
198368	198371	198372	198372	His	10551	“ Alayna — ”
198405	198414	198394	198394	Celia	9246	“ I ’ve told them . They know . ”
198415	198421	198422	198422	Jack	10551	“ Celia , stop it , ”
198425	198429	198401	198401	her	9246	“ Know what ? ”
198458	198483	198453	198453	Jack	10551	“ Are you going to tell her , Celia ? It ’s only fair for her to hear it from the horse ’s mouth . ”
198489	198497	198484	198484	Sophia	1858	“ Are you calling Celia a horse ? ”
198498	198515	198516	198516	Brian	1286	“ Dammit , Laynie . I knew this was going to happen . I knew it . ”
198522	198528	198529	198529	I	884	“ Shut up , Brian . ”
198537	198543	198529	198529	I	884	“ What is going on ? ”
198550	198557	198544	198544	Celia	9246	“ You need help , Laynie . ”
198567	198589	198558	198558	Celia	9246	“ I want you to know , I ’m not mad at you and I do n’t blame you for anything — ”
198590	198599	198601	198601	I	884	“ What the fuck are you talking about ? ”
198628	198631	198632	198632	Jack	10551	“ Fine . ”
198639	198673	198674	198674	He	10551	“ Since you are n’t going to explain , then I ’ll do it . Laynie , you know I love seeing you . I ’m sorry it ’s under these ludicrous circumstances . ”
198693	198722	198723	198723	Jack	10551	“ Celia showed up at our house this morning throwing a hissy fit with these outrageous claims about you . Then she called Hudson and your brother here , ”
198730	198763	198723	198723	Jack	10551	“ and arranged for this whole extravaganza . Good thing I was around so I could come along and try to pound some sense into these people who are listening to her . ”
198782	198790	198792	198792	my	884	“ What is she saying about me ? ”
198816	198824	198829	198829	Jack	10551	“ That you ’ve been harassing her . ”
198836	198841	198829	198829	Jack	10551	“ Oh my god . ”
198852	198857	198829	198829	Jack	10551	“ Oh my god . ”
198865	198887	198858	198858	Celia	9246	“ I have the proof . She ’s called several times and hung up . It ’s on my call log . ”
198935	198938	198923	198923	She	9246	“ Laynie ? ”
199015	199032	199006	199006	I	884	“ I did . But only because she told me to call her over and over . ”
199033	199038	199039	199039	Celia	9246	“ That ’s ridiculous , ”
199042	199052	199039	199039	Celia	9246	“ Why would I ask her to do that ? ”
199053	199062	199006	199006	I	884	“ She said her phone was n’t working . ”
199072	199093	199006	199006	I	884	“ She said that if I wanted to get a hold of her I should keep calling until she answered . ”
199107	199164	199094	199094	Celia	9246	“ She also followed me around town , to jobs I ’ve been working . I ’ve been working at Fit Nation and my bodyguard saw her at the coffee shop there today , alone , for nearly an hour . And when I called to check in , she ’d left a message for me . ”
199165	199171	199172	199172	I	884	“ She set me up . ”
199182	199189	199190	199190	Mira	8319	“ Stupid , stupid , stupid . ”
199223	199251	199281	199281	Our	3030	“ And the staff at A Voce can confirm that Alayna just walked up and joined me when I was about to have lunch the other day . ”
199252	199261	199262	199262	I	884	“ What , did you pay them off ? ”
199268	199280	199262	199262	I	884	“ I did n’t have to . It ’s the truth . ”
199358	199372	199349	199349	Jack	10551	“ And what did you do , Celia ? Did you notify security ? ”
199373	199382	199383	199383	Her	8319	“ I did n’t want to be rude . ”
199503	199508	199509	199509	I	884	“ It ’s bullshit . ”
199522	199537	199509	199509	I	884	“ She ’s lying . We were having lunch together . She invited me . ”
199538	199547	199548	199548	Celia	9246	“ She also harassed me in the restroom , ”
199551	199558	199548	199548	Celia	9246	“ On your birthday , Sophia . ”
199559	199564	199509	199509	I	884	“ I did not ! ”
199574	199583	199565	199565	Celia	9246	“ I told you that night , remember ? ”
199584	199592	199593	199593	He	3033	“ I do n’t need a reminder . ”
199627	199636	199624	199625	her ally	1858	“ He refused to believe me then too . ”
199637	199645	199646	199646	Sophia	1858	“ He ’s blinded by the sex , ”
199649	199655	199646	199646	Sophia	1858	“ It ’s not real . ”
199660	199668	199656	199656	I	884	“ She told you I harassed her ? ”
199730	199742	199723	199723	she	1858	“ Why did n’t you say anything to me , Hudson ? ”
199796	199817	199784	199784	My	884	“ She approached me in the bathroom . I went in first , remember ? And there was no harassing . ”
199836	199852	199784	199784	My	884	“ Mira was in a stall at the time ! She ’ll back me up . ”
199863	199881	199853	199853	Celia	9246	“ Mira ’s always hated me . She ’d lie to get me out of the picture . ”
199885	199904	199882	199882	Jack	10551	“ God , Celia , now you ’re dragging Mira into this ? How low will you go ? ”
199911	199917	199905	199905	Sophia	1858	“ Stop attacking the victim . ”
199918	199928	199929	199929	Jack	10551	“ Oh , Celia is anything but a victim . ”
199978	200008	199964	199964	Celia	9246	“ Please , do n’t think of me as a victim , Sophia . I ’m not complaining . I ’m really not . I ’m just … scared . ”
200018	200082	200083	200083	She	1886	“ I suppose it ’s my fault . I stopped by the club one day — I was in the neighborhood and thought I ’d be friendly . She asked me to coffee . I went , but I regret it now . That seems to have been the trigger point . She begged me not to tell you we ’d met up . ”
200089	200101	200083	200083	She	1886	“ I should have told you immediately . I ’m sorry . ”
200119	200136	200139	200139	I	884	“ This is ridiculous . You ’re the one who suggested I did n’t tell Hudson . ”
200149	200155	200139	200139	I	884	“ She ’s twisting everything ! ”
200191	200246	200186	200186	She	1886	“ I do n’t know if you know this , Hudson , but when I talked to her that day , she was obsessing over some guy from the past — Paul something or other . She was trying to set up a deal with his company so she could be close to him . ”
200254	200259	200186	200186	She	1886	“ You fucking bitch . ”
200278	200304	200272	200272	Celia	9246	“ I ’m only here because I ’m worried Laynie wo n’t get the help she needs . You have to help her , Huds . ”
200312	200330	200331	200331	I	884	“ The only help I need is a cleanup crew for after I destroy your pretty face . ”
200350	200353	200354	200354	Brian	1286	“ Laynie ! ”
200362	200382	200357	200357	Jack	10551	“ Stay calm . Getting violent is n’t going to fix anything , even though it might feel good . ”
200383	200391	200392	200392	Sophia	1858	“ Do you hear her , Hudson ? ”
200401	200411	200392	200392	Sophia	1858	“ She threatened Celia . In front of everyone . ”
200412	200420	200357	200357	Jack	10551	“ Mother , stay out of this . ”
200432	200473	200392	200392	Sophia	1858	“ Hudson , you have to get rid of her . She ’s dangerous . Celia tells me she has a record . Why on earth would you let her into your life when you knew these things about her ? ”
200474	200480	200481	200481	Hudson	1556	“ Shut up , Mother . ”
200571	200613	200561	200561	I	884	“ It makes sense why she ’d be obsessed with Celia . She knows you belong together , Hudson , and she ’s jealous . Celia was pregnant with your baby . She ca n’t compete with that , no matter — ”
200621	200647	200614	200614	Jack	10551	“ Aw , shut the fuck up , Sophia . It was n’t even Hudson ’s baby . It was mine , you ignorant bitch . ”
200674	200679	200667	200667	Hudson	1556	“ Goddammit , Jack . ”
200725	200733	200734	200734	Jack	10551	“ It ’s my business to tell , ”
200737	200747	200734	200734	Jack	10551	“ and I ’m tired of this lingering lie . ”
200748	200759	200760	200760	Hudson	1556	“ It was n’t a lie we told for you , ”
200763	200812	200734	200734	Jack	10551	“ I never thought it was . It was to protect Celia ’s ass . And I ’m sure some of it was you protecting your mother ’s feelings . Heaven knows why you care about how she feels when she obviously cares nothing for how you feel . ”
200813	200819	200820	200820	Sophia	1858	“ I do n’t understand . ”
200843	200867	200835	200835	She	1858	“ Sophia , I ’m so sorry . It was a mistake . I was drunk . It was a long time ago . ”
200871	200898	200868	200868	Jack	10551	“ You were n’t that drunk . And I know what you ’re all thinking , but she seduced me , not the other way around . ”
200899	200907	200908	200908	Sophia	1858	“ Your baby was n’t Hudson ’s ? ”
200950	201008	200931	200931	Jack	10551	“ Hudson stepped up because he knew her father would freak about the age difference , though Warren ’s had some pretty young little mistresses himself . Granted , it ’s different when it ’s your daughter . Anyway , Hudson said he felt responsible for some reason or another . Never could figure that one out . ”
201026	201086	201009	201009	He	10551	“ But I ’ll tell you what , and I ca n’t prove any of this , but I ’d bet my life that the whole thing was a set - up . She knew Hudson would claim that baby . That ’s the only reason she came knocking on my door to begin with . To trap him . ”
201087	201094	201095	201095	Celia	9246	“ That ’s low , Jack , ”
201098	201105	201106	201106	I	884	“ You ’re one to talk . ”
201127	201149	201121	201121	She	9246	“ Let ’s not forget why we ’re here . Not to discuss the past but to discuss Laynie ’s future . ”
201150	201162	201163	201163	Jack	10551	“ I think that topic is on hold for the moment . ”
201184	201190	201174	201174	Sophia	1858	“ You and … Celia ? ”
201191	201209	201210	201210	Sophia	1858	“ Do n’t act so surprised . We have n’t been faithful to each other for years . ”
201233	201244	201220	201220	she	1858	“ You coldhearted asshole . I ’ve always been faithful . ”
201252	201261	201245	201245	Jack	10551	“ One word for you sweetheart — Chandler . ”
201262	201325	201245	201245	Jack	10551	“ Chandler is yours . I do n’t know why he does n’t look like you . I ’ll get a blood test to prove it if you want me to . And despite the myriad of affairs you ’ve had over the years , I would never have thought you ’d stoop so low to sleep with your son ’s girlfriend . ”
201326	201333	201334	201334	Hudson	1556	“ She was never my girlfriend ! ”
201344	201351	201334	201334	Hudson	1556	“ She was never his girlfriend ! ”
201368	201377	201361	201361	Brian	1286	“ Wow . This family is fucked up . ”
201441	201447	201434	201434	I	884	“ Tell me about it . ”
201578	201581	201582	201582	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ! ”
201615	201621	201622	201622	he	655	“ Why did you leave ? ”
201629	201649	201622	201622	he	655	“ Is n’t it obvious ? That was a madhouse and I did n’t want to be there anymore . ”
201650	201657	201596	201596	He	655	“ Yes , that it was . ”
201658	201663	201622	201622	he	655	“ I , um … ”
201682	201713	201622	201622	he	655	“ Why did n’t you defend me up there ? Are you that mad about the David situation ? It ’s me supposed to be mad at you , remember ? ”
201720	201723	201728	201728	me	884	“ Wait — ”
201733	201738	201728	201728	me	884	“ You believe her . ”
201743	201746	201728	201728	me	884	“ Hudson ? ”
201822	201828	201829	201829	His	655	“ I believe in you . ”
201834	201853	201829	201829	His	655	“ And whatever you need , I want to give it to you . If you need help — ”
201854	201866	201867	201867	I	884	“ Oh , my god , I ca n’t believe this . ”
201874	201882	201867	201867	I	884	“ I ca n’t fucking believe this . ”
201890	201916	201883	201883	Hudson	1556	“ Tell me that you did n’t do it . Tell me you did n’t call her . Tell me you did n’t see her . ”
201962	201986	201957	201957	I	884	“ It ’s not how it looks , Hudson . I did n’t stalk her or harass her or whatever she ’s claiming . ”
202014	202023	202006	202006	he	3064	“ Are you on her side or mine ? ”
202024	202036	202044	202044	He	3064	“ I ’m on your side . Always , your side . ”
202037	202043	202006	202006	he	3064	“ Then you believe me ? ”
202056	202062	202044	202044	He	3064	“ Did you call her ? ”
202063	202072	202073	202073	I	884	“ Yes ! I said I did upstairs ! ”
202106	202137	202092	202092	I	884	“ Here , you want to see ? Take it ! You ’ll see all the times I called her since that ’s what you seem to be concerned with . ”
202144	202157	202138	202138	He	3064	“ I do n’t want proof . I want to help you . ”
202158	202167	202168	202168	I	884	“ I do n’t fucking need any help ! ”
202254	202261	202248	202248	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , come back here . ”
202299	202313	202280	202280	He	3068	“ I ’ll cancel my trip . We ’ll find the best treatment — ”
202314	202320	202321	202321	I	884	“ I ’m not sick . ”
202329	202344	202321	202321	I	884	“ Go to Japan , Hudson . I do n’t want to see you . ”
202345	202354	202355	202355	He	3068	“ I ’m not going to Japan now . ”
202370	202375	202376	202376	I	884	“ Go to Japan , ”
202382	202429	202376	202376	I	884	“ I do n’t want to see you for a while , if not ever . Got it ? If you ’re at the penthouse when I get home , I ’ll find somewhere else to sleep and I do n’t mean for just one night . ”
202796	202803	202828	202829	My brother	700	“ Laynie , is that you ? ”
202820	202827	202815	202815	Brian	1286	“ Yeah , it ’s me . ”
202847	202854	202828	202829	My brother	700	“ Awesome . Are you okay ? ”
202863	202868	202869	202869	I	884	“ I guess so . ”
202879	202886	202869	202869	I	884	“ What are you doing here ? ”
202887	202926	202927	202927	He	700	“ Hudson said he had to go on some business trip , but he did n’t want to leave you alone . So he had some guy pick up my stuff from the Waldorf and moved me in . ”
202936	202948	202927	202927	He	700	“ I hope you do n’t mind that I ’m here . ”
202949	202957	202927	202927	He	700	“ I ’m actually kind of glad . ”
203017	203029	203009	203009	Brian	1286	“ Personally , I think he should have canceled his trip . ”
203030	203043	203044	203044	I	884	“ He probably should have . But I told him not to . ”
203067	203075	203044	203044	I	884	“ Anything interesting happen after I left ? ”
203092	203113	203076	203076	Brian	1286	“ Not really . More of the same . Accusations and liquor . You know , a typical family party . ”
203152	203160	203161	203161	I	884	“ Hudson ’s mother ’s an alcoholic . ”
203171	203206	203161	203161	I	884	“ Yeah , I picked up on that . She has that weird yellow skin thing that Dad had . And she was shaky when I first met her . Does she acknowledge it ? ”
203207	203225	203226	203227	Our dad	3086	“ No . No one does . She ’s a different drunk than Dad was , though . ”
203271	203275	203264	203264	his	3086	“ How so ? ”
203276	203287	203288	203288	I	884	“ She ’s mean . Hateful . Vindictive . Bitter . ”
203291	203297	203288	203288	I	884	“ Did I say mean ? ”
203306	203317	203298	203298	I	884	“ God , this baby thing is probably killing her . ”
203318	203333	203288	203288	I	884	“ Right ? What a way to find out your husband cheated on you . ”
203334	203366	203298	203298	I	884	“ Not even because of that . Jack ’s infidelity is old news . That he was with Celia is a surprise . I thought he had better taste than that . ”
203466	203521	203522	203522	Brian	1286	“ Anyway , I meant because Sophia was so set on that pregnancy being evidence of why Celia and Hudson should be together . Like , she brings it up all the time . Nearly ten years later , she ’s still pining over this miscarriage . For this match that did n’t happen . ”
203537	203607	203522	203522	Brian	1286	“ You know what I think ? I think she knew all the time that there ’d been something between Celia and Jack . You know how you just know things like that sometimes . She probably thought if Celia was with Hudson , then maybe somehow that would punish Jack or maybe even help her win him back or something . It ’s obvious she loves the guy . ”
203617	203635	203636	203636	I	884	“ That ’s very insightful . You actually make me feel kind of sorry for the lady . ”
203639	203648	203636	203636	I	884	“ Stop it . I prefer hating her . ”
203698	203711	203689	203689	He	1286	“ I ’m really sorry you got dragged into all of this . ”
203720	203733	203734	203734	He	1286	“ I ’m really sorry I have n’t been here for you . ”
203752	203777	203734	203734	He	1286	“ I guess I was wrong to cut you off like I did . It did n’t help you like I thought it would . ”
203778	203800	203734	203734	He	1286	“ I hate to say this , but it was probably the best thing you could have ever done for me . ”
203807	203823	203734	203734	He	1286	“ Despite how it looks at the moment , I ’ve been doing pretty well . ”
203824	203838	203839	203839	He	1286	“ That ’s exactly how it looks . Good job , good boyfriend … ”
203844	203859	203839	203839	He	1286	“ I know you did n’t do those things that Celia says you did . ”
203864	203870	203860	203860	My	884	“ You do ? How ? ”
203880	203905	203871	203871	Brian	1286	“ First of all , calling and hanging up ? That ’s so not your style . You ’re much more creative than that . ”
203914	203981	203906	203906	I	884	“ Second , you ’ve never messed with women . And , third , no matter what shit you ’ve pulled , you ’ve never denied it . That was one reliable thing about you — you were always willing to admit your mistakes . Plus , you look … good . You ’ve never looked this good before . Not since they died , anyway . ”
204005	204021	204024	204024	he	1286	“ Thank you , Brian . It means a lot to hear you say that . ”
204044	204055	204038	204038	I	884	“ So what do I do now , Mr. Lawyer ? ”
204056	204083	204024	204024	he	1286	“ About Celia Werner ? Nothing . She does n’t have anything to press charges for and she says she ’s not pursuing a restraining order . ”
204084	204096	204097	204097	I	884	“ Because a restraining order would keep her from Hudson too . ”
204100	204112	204097	204097	I	884	“ As long as he ’s with me , that is . ”
204113	204133	204134	204134	His	1286	“ Is that why she ’s saying all this stuff about you ? Is she in love with him ? ”
204150	204201	204097	204097	I	884	“ Maybe . I ’m not sure if she ’s in love with him or if she wants to mess with him . People warned me not to trust her . It makes me wonder if she has a rep for doing shit like this . I ’m not sure . ”
204202	204215	204256	204256	people	726	“ All I can suggest is to stay away from her now . ”
204216	204220	204097	204097	I	884	“ No kidding . ”
204292	204295	204300	204300	I	884	“ Oh . ”
204330	204338	204339	204339	I	884	“ I need to give you this . ”
204358	204385	204346	204346	He	1286	“ You sure you do n’t want to keep it ? I could sign another year lease . In case things do n’t work out here . ”
204386	204395	204396	204396	I	884	“ Which is very possible at this point . ”
204435	204455	204431	204431	Brian	1286	“ I told him , you know . Hudson . That I knew you did n’t stalk that girl . ”
204461	204467	204431	204431	Brian	1286	“ What did he say ? ”
204468	204480	204431	204431	Brian	1286	“ Nothing . He ’s a very hard man to read . ”
204491	204497	204481	204481	I	884	“ Yes , he is . ”
204648	204687	204636	204636	I	884	“ No . I do n’t want another lease . I do n’t want you taking care of me anymore . It ’s time for me to do it myself . If things do n’t work out here — ”
204702	204734	204636	204636	I	884	“ I ’ll have to get something cheaper . Which is fine . I could find some place closer to the subway . Maybe I ’ll get a roommate or something . ”
204793	204802	204781	204781	I	884	“ I ’m gon na go collapse now . ”
204816	204821	204781	204781	I	884	“ Goodnight , Bri . ”
204836	204839	204840	204840	I	884	“ Yeah ? ”
204847	204857	204840	204840	I	884	“ Let ’s not be like them , okay ? ”
204873	204890	204858	204858	He	1286	“ You mean the hateful , spiteful , backstabbing family thing is n’t appealing to you ? ”
204891	204895	204870	204870	he	1286	“ Not really . ”
204949	204962	204942	204942	My	884	“ Then it ’s settled . We wo n’t be like them . ”
205128	205132	205133	205133	He	1286	“ Good morning . ”
205139	205147	205133	205133	He	1286	“ Or should I say good afternoon ? ”
205148	205160	205161	205161	I	884	“ Sorry . I did n’t get much sleep last night . ”
205177	205183	205133	205133	He	1286	“ You look like shit . ”
205184	205187	205188	205188	I	884	“ Thanks . ”
205203	205213	205133	205133	He	1286	“ Are you supposed to be at work today ? ”
205214	205217	205218	205218	I	884	“ Tonight . ”
205248	205255	205236	205236	I	884	“ Thanks for asking , Dad . ”
205256	205262	205263	205263	Jesus	680	“ Got to start practicing . ”
205290	205299	205280	205280	I	884	“ How far along is Monica , anyway ? ”
205318	205332	205305	205305	I	884	“ Four months . We find out the sex in a few weeks . ”
205333	205346	205300	205300	He	680	“ That ’s pretty cool . And a little bit scary too . ”
205347	205353	205305	205305	I	884	“ Tell me about it . ”
205461	205468	205447	205447	I	884	“ What are you looking at ? ”
205469	205481	205482	205482	He	1286	“ Celia ’s cell log . She left a printout here . ”
205488	205512	205482	205482	He	1286	“ I was looking at the calls she made . She called The Sky Launch once . Last Friday . Here it is . ”
205532	205541	205482	205482	He	1286	“ Is n’t that the club ’s number ? ”
205542	205566	205567	205567	I	884	“ Yeah , it is . But she never called me at the club . Wait , I know that number , too . ”
205575	205583	205567	205567	I	884	“ That ’s Aaron Trent ’s office . ”
205589	205604	205567	205567	I	884	“ That bitch . She ’s the one who canceled my meeting with him . ”
205605	205612	205628	205628	She	1858	“ What are you talking about ? ”
205665	205697	205698	205698	My	884	“ Oh , it ’s nothing now . I had a meeting and when it got canceled it stirred up a lot of crap between me and Hudson . Long story . ”
205720	205727	205708	205708	I	884	“ That ’s Hudson ’s number . ”
205728	205738	205698	205698	My	884	“ She has quite a few calls to him . ”
205739	205744	205745	205745	I	884	“ I see that . ”
205748	205759	205745	205745	I	884	“ I do n’t know what to think about that . ”
205760	205774	205698	205698	My	884	“ None of them are very long . And she always called him . ”
205775	205778	205745	205745	I	884	“ Hmm . ”
205826	205837	205838	205838	Brian	1286	“ So what now ? Between you and Hudson Pierce ? ”
205853	205859	205860	205860	I	884	“ I ’m not sure . ”
205873	205907	205860	205860	I	884	“ I guess I ’ll wait until he comes back and we ’ll see how that goes . The time apart might be good for us . Give us some time to think . ”
205934	205938	205939	205939	He	1286	“ Good plan . ”
205942	205970	205939	205939	He	1286	“ You know , just because he does n’t believe you does n’t mean he does n’t love you . Trust me . I speak from experience . ”
205976	205984	205971	205971	I	884	“ Yeah , I guess you do . ”
206064	206085	206056	206056	Brian	1286	“ Anyway , speaking of phones , do you want me to go with you to get a replacement today ? ”
206097	206112	206091	206091	I	884	“ No . I ’m afraid if I have it I ’ll call Hudson . ”
206187	206207	206177	206177	I	884	“ I need to be completely cut off from him to get my head around everything , you know ? ”
206208	206218	206177	206177	I	884	“ Not really . But if you say so . ”
206219	206226	206177	206177	I	884	“ Yeah . I say so . ”
206599	206609	206610	206610	I	884	“ He sent you to check up on me ? ”
206654	206674	206634	206634	he	3117	“ You ’re not taking any of his calls , Laynie . What else was he supposed to do ? ”
206675	206684	206634	206634	he	3117	“ He already left notes with the doorman . ”
206685	206691	206634	206634	he	3117	“ Did you read them ? ”
206692	206706	206634	206634	he	3117	“ Not so much . I was afraid of what they ’d say . ”
206724	206735	206736	206736	She	8319	“ Did you think he was breaking up with you ? ”
206739	206766	206736	206736	She	8319	“ No . Way . Even if he wanted to , I would n’t let him . And he does n’t want to . Trust me . ”
206832	206838	206824	206824	I	884	“ Want to come up ? ”
206839	206846	206824	206824	I	884	“ I was counting on it . ”
206892	206899	206900	206900	I	884	“ Can I get you something ? ”
206909	206929	206900	206900	I	884	“ Um , mind if I raid your fridge ? I just ate breakfast and I ’m still starving . ”
206940	206945	206930	206930	I	884	“ Go for it . ”
206977	206983	206967	206967	I	884	“ Want anything to drink ? ”
206984	206989	206990	206990	She	8319	“ Water ’s good . ”
207061	207064	207065	207065	she	8319	“ So , ”
207076	207086	207065	207065	she	8319	“ Lots of crazy went down here last week . ”
207087	207101	207104	207104	I	884	“ We ’re jumping right into it then ? No small talk first ? ”
207123	207150	207151	207151	Mira	8319	“ Are you kidding me ? I ’ve been dying to talk about this with you . Do you not know I ’m a gossip fiend ? ”
207165	207176	207065	207065	she	8319	“ You had n’t known about Celia ’s baby either ? ”
207177	207243	207151	207151	Mira	8319	“ Nope . No clue . I was always sure it was n’t Hudson ’s . I do n’t know why — I was barely fourteen when it all happened , but he never seemed to be into her . They never even kissed or anything that I saw . And , trust me ; I was the type of sister that saw a lot . ”
207264	207272	207259	207259	she	8319	“ Somehow I do n’t doubt that . ”
207273	207285	207286	207286	She	8319	“ I did n’t ever think it was Dad ’s though . ”
207303	207316	207317	207317	She	8319	“ I still ca n’t think about that . It ’s gross . ”
207349	207359	207332	207332	I	884	“ How is your mother dealing with the news ? ”
207363	207383	207360	207360	Mira	8319	“ Who knows ? Every time she starts to feel something other than bitterness she simply refills her bourbon . ”
207392	207396	207384	207384	I	884	“ Good times . ”
207448	207462	207463	207463	She	1120	“ Mom will get over it . Or she wo n’t . Whatever . ”
207475	207497	207472	207472	she	1120	“ I do n’t know why she was so attached to Celia to begin with . I ’m sorry about that . ”
207498	207512	207513	207513	She	1120	“ Whatever . You are n’t responsible for your mother ’s bad taste . ”
207516	207531	207513	207513	She	1120	“ I know , but it ’s embarrassing . Celia ’s such a bitch . ”
207539	207570	207532	207532	Mira	8319	“ She ’s always been … I do n’t know … fake . I ’ve never trusted her , but I still ca n’t believe she did this to you . ”
207578	207608	207573	207573	my	884	“ It was my own fault . Not because I stalked her , but because I did n’t listen to the warnings not to get mixed up with her . ”
207609	207618	207619	207619	Mira	8319	“ I know you did n’t stalk her . ”
207624	207648	207619	207619	Mira	8319	“ Please . Do you think I do n’t ? Why would you do that ? It ’s not like you at all . ”
207704	207740	207693	207693	I	884	“ Joke ’s on you , I guess . That ’s exactly like me . I used to do that crap all the time . Stalk people , I mean . I have a record . ”
207749	207762	207741	207741	Mira	8319	“ No wonder you and Hudson are so good for each other . ”
207795	207809	207763	207763	My	884	“ Anyway , you do n’t do that stuff now , do you ? ”
207810	207813	207763	207763	My	884	“ No . ”
207814	207832	207833	207833	She	8319	“ See ? And you now is who I know , so do n’t correct me again . ”
207851	207878	207833	207833	She	8319	“ Plus , I was in that bathroom . You did n’t harass her in the least . I told Hudson that , by the way . ”
207915	207921	207909	207909	I	884	“ Did he believe you ? ”
207922	207929	207930	207930	Her	8319	“ Of course , he did . ”
207935	207960	207930	207930	Her	8319	“ Is that what this is about ? You do n’t think he knows you did n’t do that stuff ? He totally does . ”
207961	207969	207909	207909	I	884	“ Because of what you told him ? ”
207970	207973	207930	207930	Her	8319	“ Yeah . ”
207974	207981	207909	207909	I	884	“ That ’s what I thought . ”
207986	208002	208003	208003	Her	8319	“ I mean , maybe it was n’t me . He probably believed you without … ”
208008	208011	208012	208012	She	8319	“ Shit . ”
208021	208036	208012	208012	She	8319	“ He would have figured it out if you were n’t avoiding his calls . ”
208037	208043	208012	208012	She	8319	“ My phone ’s broken . ”
208044	208055	208012	208012	She	8319	“ And the times he ’s called at the club ? ”
208056	208064	208065	208065	I	884	“ Okay , I ’m avoiding those . ”
208077	208097	208065	208065	I	884	“ It ’s not because I do n’t want to talk to him . It’s … it ’s complicated . ”
208157	208213	208154	208154	I	884	“ There ’s more than this . I did some things that I should n’t have done . And he did some things that he should n’t have done . There ’s a lot of fixing and stuff to be said and I think the things we need to say need to be in person . ”
208214	208220	208286	208286	her	8319	“ So go to him . ”
208226	208230	208221	208221	I	884	“ To Japan ? ”
208231	208273	208274	208274	Mira	8319	“ Why not ? What you ’re saying makes sense . Big things need to be face - to - face . It ’s easier to be honest . Harder to run away . Yeah , you should go to him . ”
208291	208301	208286	208286	her	8319	“ Is n’t he going to come back soon ? ”
208302	208321	208286	208286	her	8319	“ It does n’t sound like it . The people he ’s dealing with are dragging their feet . ”
208322	208325	208286	208286	her	8319	“ Oh . ”
208366	208383	208286	208286	her	8319	“ I ca n’t go to Japan . I do n’t have that kind of money . ”
208384	208391	208286	208286	her	8319	“ I ’d foot the bill . ”
208392	208413	208286	208286	her	8319	“ Oh , no . I ’m not letting you pay for me to go to Japan . Get real . ”
208428	208470	208414	208414	Mira	8319	“ I have about as much money as my brother , you know . A trip to Japan is a drop in a very large bucket , and I ’m not trying to brag . I ’m trying to be clear . ”
208480	208489	208490	208490	she	8319	“ But if that ’s really an issue , ”
208498	208520	208490	208490	she	8319	“ then charge it to The Sky Launch . Hudson ’s money . He wanted you out there to begin with . ”
208563	208576	208558	208558	I	884	“ Did he send you to convince me to go to Japan ? ”
208577	208580	208581	208581	She	8319	“ No ! ”
208585	208599	208581	208581	She	8319	“ Uh - uh . Do not give him credit for my idea . ”
208620	208625	208626	208626	Mira	8319	“ Think about it , ”
208634	208643	208626	208626	Mira	8319	“ Would n’t that be an awesome surprise ? ”
208658	208667	208644	208644	I	884	“ Yeah . It kind of would be . ”
208673	208678	208644	208644	I	884	“ I miss him . ”
208687	208720	208682	208682	Mira	8319	“ Laynie , he ’s dying without you ! I can hear it in his voice . He ’s a basket case . He ca n’t eat , he ca n’t sleep — ”
208721	208727	208644	208644	I	884	“ He told you this ? ”
208728	208733	208682	208682	Mira	8319	“ I can tell ! ”
208748	208761	208734	208734	I	884	“ Has anyone ever told you that you ’re a hopeless romantic ? ”
208762	208773	208644	208644	I	884	“ It does n’t mean I ’m wrong about Hudson . ”
208774	208778	208734	208734	I	884	“ Maybe not . ”
208806	208823	208824	208824	She	8319	“ You know , he told Celia he does n’t want her in his life anymore . ”
208843	208846	208852	208852	myself	884	“ What ? ”
208861	208866	208852	208852	myself	884	“ Are you serious ? ”
208870	208879	208867	208867	She	8319	“ Why did n’t you lead with that ? ”
208880	208888	208867	208867	She	8319	“ I guess I probably should have . ”
208898	208908	208867	208867	She	8319	“ What else ? Tell me all the details . ”
208909	208944	208867	208867	She	8319	“ I do n’t know what else . I was n’t there . It was here , that day that everything else happened . Dad told me about it . Said she was crestfallen . ”
208945	208957	208867	208867	She	8319	“ So this was before he believed that I was innocent ? ”
208958	208961	208867	208867	She	8319	“ Yeah . ”
208962	208976	208867	208867	She	8319	“ Then why did he tell her he did n’t want her around ? ”
209000	209065	209066	209066	She	8319	“ This is so third - hand gossip , but Dad said that Hudson told Celia that she was obviously not good for you and so he expected her to stay out of your life from now on . No phone calls , no stopping by the club , no stopping by the penthouse , no family functions . Completely out of your life . ”
209080	209102	209066	209066	She	8319	“ And he said that since your life was his life , that meant he could n’t be around her either . ”
209103	209108	209109	209109	She	8319	“ No . Way . ”
209128	209173	209174	209174	Her	8319	“ Yes , way . Of course way . Why would you even doubt way ? I keep telling you he loves you . You hang the moon for him . He ’ll do anything to keep you . Ca n’t you see that ? ”
209195	209220	209189	209189	I	884	“ He chose me over Celia . Even when he thought that I ’d gone all crazy again . That’s … that ’s big . ”
209221	209232	209233	209233	She	8319	“ Yes ! It ’s big ! It ’s huge ! ”
209257	209269	209250	209250	she	8319	“ Now what are you going to do to match that ? ”
209279	209282	209270	209270	I	884	“ Okay . ”
209297	209304	209283	209283	I	884	“ I ’ll go to Japan . ”
209365	209368	209358	209358	Mira	8319	“ Yes ! ”
209369	209376	209378	209378	my	884	“ It ’s Sunday , right ? ”
209392	209429	209378	209378	my	884	“ I ca n’t leave until tonight . Someone ’s renting out the club and I ’m scheduled to get them set up . I could leave right after that though . Like eight or so . ”
209430	209435	209358	209358	Mira	8319	“ That ’s perfect . ”
209440	209478	209436	209436	I	884	“ This is going to sound ridiculous , but I do n’t even know how to travel out of the country . I ’ve been to Canada once . That ’s the extent of my foreign travel . ”
209479	209487	209488	209488	Mira	8319	“ I ’ll take care of everything , ”
209493	209500	209488	209488	Mira	8319	“ Do you have a passport ? ”
209504	209522	209501	209501	I	884	“ Hudson got me one . He left it on the nightstand . Do you need it ? ”
209523	209538	209539	209539	Her	8319	“ No , you need it . Make sure you bring it with you . ”
209552	209564	209539	209539	Her	8319	“ Do you have a credit card for The Sky Launch ? ”
209565	209568	209569	209569	I	884	“ Yep . ”
209585	209590	209591	209591	I	884	“ Here you go , ”
209612	209615	209616	209616	Mira	8319	“ Yay ! ”
209630	209651	209616	209616	Mira	8319	“ This is so exciting ! I always wanted a sister ! You guys will make the most beautiful babies . ”
209652	209658	209616	209616	Mira	8319	“ Hey , slow down . ”
209669	209676	209677	209677	I	884	“ No one said anything about … ”
209685	209694	209677	209677	I	884	“ I ca n’t even finish that sentence . ”
209695	209703	209728	209728	She	8319	“ Sorry . I ’m an optimist . ”
209715	209727	209704	209704	I	884	“ Keep your optimism to yourself from now on , okay ? ”
209733	209736	209728	209728	She	8319	“ Okay . ”
209748	209782	209783	209783	She	8319	“ I mean , not okay . I have to know because I ’m ultra nosy — do you want that stuff ? You know , kids , marriage . The whole package . ”
209788	209792	209783	209783	She	8319	“ With Hudson . ”
209817	209825	209826	209826	I	884	“ Here ’s the thing , Mira . ”
209844	209892	209826	209826	I	884	“ I used to want it so bad that I thought every guy was the whole package , that every guy was The One . And I ’d do everything to make them believe the same about me . I mean everything . Not so good things . ”
209900	209946	209947	209947	My	884	“ So now I ca n’t even let myself think about it , not even to daydream for a few seconds or to test it out and see how it feels . So the answer is do n’t ask me that . I ca n’t . ”
209956	209962	209947	209947	My	884	“ I just ca n’t . ”
209969	209984	209963	209963	Mira	8319	“ Then do n’t . I daydream about it enough for both of us . ”
209985	209989	209990	209990	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
209993	209998	209999	209999	She	8319	“ You ’re welcome . ”
210010	210026	210003	210003	she	8319	“ Now get packing , girl ! We ’ve got to get you to Japan ! ”
210031	210040	210003	210003	she	8319	“ Should I change or stay in this ? ”
210135	210149	210118	210118	Liesl	166	“ Laynie , chill the fuck out . You ’re making me insane . ”
210150	210153	210121	210121	her	166	“ Okay . ”
210190	210195	210178	210178	I	884	“ Okay . Chilling . ”
210196	210200	210201	210201	She	166	“ Thank god . ”
210217	210257	210201	210201	She	166	“ You look smokin ’ . But you should change into sweats for the flight so you can be all comfy and drool while you sleep and all that . Then change back into this in the airport bathroom . ”
210258	210261	210201	210201	She	166	“ Okay . ”
210417	210429	210405	210405	she	166	“ Do you know where you ’re going when you land ? ”
210430	210447	210405	210405	she	166	“ Mira arranged for a car to pick me up and take me to his hotel . ”
210458	210485	210454	210454	I	884	“ But what if he ’s not there ? What if I have to wait or what if I miss him ? Or what if … . ”
210493	210501	210454	210454	I	884	“ what if he ’s with someone ? ”
210502	210515	210550	210550	I	884	“ He wo n’t be with anyone . He ’s with you . ”
210516	210523	210454	210454	I	884	“ But how do you know ? ”
210524	210527	210528	210528	She	3142	“ I … ”
210545	210549	210528	210528	She	3142	“ Just do . ”
210559	210568	210569	210569	She	3142	“ What ? Are we in grade school ? ”
210572	210614	210569	210569	She	3142	“ I can tell by the way he looks at you . Everyone can . Come on , Laynie , he asked you to move in with him . After what ? A week ? He ’s into you , girl . ”
210615	210626	210627	210627	I	884	“ All right , all right . You ’re right . ”
210636	210658	210627	210627	I	884	“ The renters are supposed to be here in twenty . We should go down in case they get here early . ”
210659	210664	210665	210665	Liesl	166	“ Um , okay . ”
210674	210680	210681	210681	She	3142	“ Hold on a minute . ”
210705	210716	210697	210697	she	3142	“ Leisl ! They could be waiting at the door — ”
210717	210726	210727	210727	She	3142	“ I ’m coming , I ’m coming . ”
210733	210740	210741	210741	She	3142	“ Wait ; one more thing . ”
210756	210763	210741	210741	She	3142	“ Okay . Let ’s go . ”
210771	210788	210766	210766	I	884	“ You did n’t have to come in tonight . I could have handled this myself . ”
210815	210841	210806	210806	Liesl	166	“ I know . But I thought you could use the company . It ’s not a good idea to be in the club alone . ”
210863	210871	210857	210857	she	3142	“ It was very thoughtful of you . ”
210872	210877	210878	210878	She	3142	“ Uh - huh . ”
210883	210891	210878	210878	She	3142	“ Um , are your bags packed ? ”
210892	210905	210906	210906	We	3148	“ Yep . Jordan will have them when he picks me up . ”
210930	210934	210926	210926	my	884	“ What the … ”
210992	210995	210985	210985	Liesl	166	“ Wowzers . ”
211044	211047	211028	211029	A figure	8269	“ Hudson ? ”
211083	211088	211079	211079	he	8269	“ You did this ? ”
211099	211110	211089	211089	He	8269	“ Thank you , Liesl , for keeping her occupied . ”
211119	211125	211111	211111	I	884	“ You knew about this ? ”
211146	211183	211184	211184	Liesl	166	“ Hey , he kept calling and you would n’t talk to him and then he trapped me into this whole surprise you thingamabob . He asked me to keep you busy upstairs while he did — ”
211190	211194	211195	211195	Her	166	“ All this . ”
211205	211218	211195	211195	Her	166	“ He ’s my boss , what was I supposed to say ? ”
211219	211226	211227	211227	I	884	“ He ’s not your boss , ”
211245	211252	211242	211242	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m not your boss . ”
211321	211336	211313	211313	Liesl	166	“ I ’m going to slip out the back . ‘ K , thanks . ”
211454	211460	211461	211461	He	884	“ ‘ Bags packed ’ ? ”
211470	211476	211461	211461	He	884	“ Are you going somewhere ? ”
211508	211517	211477	211477	I	884	“ Oh , nowhere special . Just Japan . ”
211518	211526	211527	211527	His	884	“ Because … I was in Japan ? ”
211544	211547	211548	211548	I	884	“ Yeah . ”
211575	211590	211548	211548	I	884	“ I thought I could put my stalking skills to use to find you . ”
211591	211603	211548	211548	I	884	“ I would have liked to have been found by you . ”
211623	211632	211604	211604	I	884	“ Would you ? I was n’t sure . ”
211633	211640	211548	211548	I	884	“ Then you ’re an idiot . ”
211641	211645	211604	211604	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
211646	211660	211548	211548	I	884	“ A beautiful idiot that I ca n’t take my eyes off of . ”
211727	211737	211738	211738	His	884	“ Hudson , I saw Celia behind your back . ”
211746	211753	211738	211738	His	884	“ I ’ve figured that out . ”
211754	211761	211762	211762	I	884	“ I should have told you . ”
211785	211804	211777	211777	I	884	“ She was welcoming and supportive and I needed someone to talk to . It ’s no excuse . ”
211809	211817	211805	211805	His	884	“ You could have talked to me . ”
211818	211827	211805	211805	His	884	“ We do n’t always talk that well . ”
211828	211838	211805	211805	His	884	“ We need to work on that , then . ”
211866	211873	211874	211874	He	884	“ You hurt me , Hudson . ”
211887	211891	211874	211874	He	884	“ I know . ”
211892	211896	211874	211874	He	884	“ Do you ? ”
211897	211908	211874	211874	He	884	“ Yes . I transferred David without talking to you . ”
211909	211912	211874	211874	He	884	“ Well . ”
211931	211948	211920	211920	I	884	“ It turns out that ’s probably for the best . It was a good compromise . ”
211949	211957	211958	211958	He	884	“ And I did n’t believe you . ”
211969	211976	211958	211958	He	884	“ I should have believed you . ”
211984	211989	211958	211958	He	884	“ I ’m sorry . ”
211990	211996	211920	211920	I	884	“ Why did n’t you ? ”
212000	212029	211997	211997	He	884	“ I was more concerned with being the guy who would stand by you . I wanted you to know I ’d help you , get you treatment . ”
212030	212048	211958	211958	He	884	“ I did n’t need treatment . I needed you to believe me and you did n’t . ”
212049	212071	211997	211997	He	884	“ We had n’t had a good track record in being honest with each other . It was instinctual to doubt . ”
212076	212090	212072	212072	My	884	“ Then it ’s my fault that you took her word over mine ? ”
212091	212113	211958	211958	He	884	“ I did n’t take her word over yours . I took the evidence and put it into a plausible scenario . ”
212124	212127	212116	212116	my	884	“ Right . ”
212148	212165	212072	212072	My	884	“ The thing you are n’t hearing , Alayna , is that I do n’t care . ”
212173	212265	212072	212072	My	884	“ I do n’t care if you did stalk Celia or call her a million times or leave a dead chicken in her bed — I do n’t care . I just want you . I want to be with you . If you were sick , then there was a chance that I would lose you . And I ca n’t . Whatever it takes to make that happen . Whatever I have to do . Whatever I have to say . I have to have you in my life . ”
212485	212495	212467	212467	I	884	“ I do n’t know how to do this . ”
212496	212500	212501	212501	He	3159	“ Do what ? ”
212524	212529	212530	212530	I	884	“ Have a relationship . ”
212540	212569	212530	212530	I	884	“ I keep fucking it up . I kept things from you . I accused you of manipulating me . I did n’t try to compromise about David . ”
212570	212580	212581	212581	He	3159	“ I do n’t care about any of that . ”
212591	212654	212581	212581	He	3159	“ Just do n’t give up on us . Please , do n’t give up . I ’m a shell without you , Alayna . I can barely breathe when you are n’t near me , when I ’m not touching you . Right now , it ’s all I can do to hold myself back from taking you in my arms . ”
212655	212662	212663	212663	My	884	“ Why are you holding back ? ”
212670	212684	212581	212581	He	3159	“ Because I do n’t want to resort to sex to solve this . ”
212685	212693	212694	212694	I	884	“ You listened . You always listen . ”
212700	212703	212581	212581	He	3159	“ Alayna . ”
212735	212775	212732	212732	my	884	“ I need you , Hudson . I need you to touch me and bring me back into sync . I ’m so far out of tune with you and it hurts — like part of me is missing . ”
212783	212789	212780	212780	his	3159	“ You get it then . ”
212790	212794	212795	212795	I	884	“ I do . ”
212845	212851	212832	212832	His	3159	“ Are we … okay ? ”
212852	212879	212832	212832	His	3159	“ I ’m not giving up , if that ’s what you ’re asking . I ’m so lost without you . Find me , Hudson . ”
212880	212885	212832	212832	His	3159	“ I already have . ”
213306	213310	213290	213290	I	884	“ Hold on . ”
213393	213397	213390	213390	He	3159	“ Come here . ”
213535	213540	213520	213520	He	3159	“ Watch , Alayna . ”
213590	213601	213612	213612	He	3159	“ Watch my cock pushing in and out of you . ”
213602	213608	213612	213612	He	3159	“ It ’s so hot . ”
213640	213648	213649	213649	His	3159	“ Alayna , are you with me ? ”
213673	213676	213677	213677	I	884	“ Always , ”
213680	213687	213677	213677	I	884	“ I ’m always with you . ”
213715	213740	213741	213741	He	3159	“ Our pasts will always threaten to come between us . But nothing can come between us unless we let it . Feel this ? ”
213749	213755	213741	213741	He	3159	“ Feel me inside you ? ”
213756	213771	213741	213741	He	3159	“ It ’s so good , Hudson . You make me feel so good . ”
213772	213781	213782	213782	He	3159	“ I know , precious , I know . ”
213813	213818	213821	213821	his	3159	“ Look at me . ”
213829	213853	213821	213821	his	3159	“ This is how connected we are , Alayna . Even when I ’m not inside you , we are always this connected . ”
213862	213873	213854	213854	His	3159	“ Fuck , Hudson , I ’m going to come . ”
213897	213903	213904	213904	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , let go , ”
213907	213919	213904	213904	Hudson	1556	“ I want to watch you give it all to me . ”
213984	214002	213973	213973	he	3159	“ You ’re so beautiful , Alayna . Absolutely beautiful . I missed you . So much . ”
214018	214023	214003	214003	I	884	“ Did you really ? ”
214024	214029	214003	214003	I	884	“ Yes , really . ”
214030	214039	214040	214040	I	884	“ I missed you too . So much . ”
214078	214094	214068	214068	I	884	“ Shit ! I need to call Mira and tell her to cancel my trip . ”
214098	214104	214095	214095	Hudson	1556	“ Already taken care of . ”
214105	214118	214095	214095	Hudson	1556	“ She told you ? It was supposed to be a surprise ! ”
214119	214147	214148	214148	He	3159	“ Mirabelle did n’t tell me . Jordan . All he said was that he ’d rearrange your evening plans . It would have been a surprise . ”
214155	214164	214148	214148	He	3159	“ If I had n’t surprised you first . ”
214165	214174	214095	214095	Hudson	1556	“ And what a happy surprise it was . ”
214175	214209	214148	214148	He	3159	“ I ’m lucky you did n’t kick me to the curb . You know , I ’ve fantasized about taking you in this club since the first time I saw you here . ”
214219	214232	214216	214216	me	884	“ I ca n’t say I have n’t had the same fantasy . ”
214268	214296	214233	214233	He	3159	“ As nice as it is having the fantasy fulfilled , I ’d much rather take you back to The Bowery and have you in our bed . ”
214297	214325	214329	214329	his	3159	“ That sounds awesome . Because as beautiful as this all is , I ’m sticky and I have rose petals stuck to my ass and thighs . ”
214338	214346	214326	214326	Hudson	1556	“ The side effects of romantic gestures . ”
214347	214358	214326	214326	Hudson	1556	“ You better get out before you get hard again . ”
214359	214364	214365	214365	He	3159	“ Already halfway there . ”
214418	214424	214404	214404	Hudson	1556	“ Ready to go home ? ”
214464	214483	214524	214524	He	3159	“ As long as you ’re there , then there ’s no place else I ’d rather be . ”
214499	214505	214493	214493	I	884	“ What about the mess ? ”
214514	214523	214511	214511	I	884	“ Let me guess — you have people . ”
214527	214532	214524	214524	He	3159	“ We have people . ”
214618	214621	214622	214622	he	3159	“ Oh , ”
214633	214643	214622	214622	he	3159	“ I almost forgot . This is for you . ”
214659	214672	214673	214673	I	884	“ So sure I have n’t already replaced it , are you ? ”
214682	214705	214679	214679	He	3159	“ You were n’t answering any of my calls or texts . I ’d hoped it was because you were still phoneless . ”
214706	214721	214679	214679	He	3159	“ I was phoneless so that I would n’t break down and call you . ”
214722	214730	214679	214679	He	3159	“ Should I ask for an explanation ? ”
214731	214750	214751	214751	I	884	“ No . It ’s just me . Thank you for the phone . It was very thoughtful . ”
214766	214775	214751	214751	I	884	“ Hey , did you get Plexis back ? ”
214776	214794	214751	214751	I	884	“ I did . But it would n’t have mattered if I had n’t gotten you back . ”
214868	214876	214861	214861	I	884	“ You never lost me , remember ? ”
214877	214886	214887	214887	We	3179	“ That ’s right . I did n’t . ”
214922	214930	214931	214931	He	3159	“ I love you , Hudson Pierce . ”
214999	215018	214995	214995	He	3159	“ Go on out . Jordan should be waiting . I ’ll set the alarm and lock up . ”
215049	215067	215030	215030	He	3159	“ Good evening , Ms. Withers . I ’m sorry to say that you missed your flight . ”
215071	215078	215068	215068	I	884	“ Another time , I suppose . ”
215229	215250	215223	215223	I	884	“ The video file is too big for text . Text me if you want to see it in person . ”
215263	215273	215253	215253	I	884	“ Btw , this is Stacy from Mirabelle ’s . ”
215336	215340	215341	215341	Hudson	1556	“ Everything okay ? ”
215353	215358	215359	215359	I	884	“ Everything ’s perfect . ”
215825	215830	215831	215832	a man	655	“ Try the buzzer , ”
215839	215843	215844	215844	I	884	“ The buzzer ? ”
216059	216063	216055	216055	Her	8674	“ You came . ”
216064	216070	216055	216055	Her	8674	“ I guess I did . ”
216111	216120	216121	216121	She	8674	“ Oh , sorry ! Come on in . ”
216224	216228	216229	216229	Stacy	8674	“ This way . ”
216487	216491	216492	216492	Stacy	8674	“ So sorry , ”
216495	216510	216492	216492	Stacy	8674	“ The springs are broken . Scoot down further and you ’ll bounce back . ”
216672	216684	216642	216642	her	8674	“ Can I get you anything ? Water ? Iced tea ? ”
216685	216691	216692	216692	I	884	“ No , thank you . ”
216697	216718	216692	216692	I	884	“ Actually , I ’m sort of on a schedule . Do you mind if we get this over with ? ”
216771	216777	216778	216778	She	3217	“ Yes . Of course . ”
216870	216897	216859	216859	Stacy	8674	“ Honestly , I was n’t sure if you ’d come . You had n’t seemed interested before . I was surprised to get your text . ”
216898	216914	216862	216862	she	8674	“ Yeah , I was n’t sure I ’d come either . Curiosity won out . ”
217009	217037	217065	217065	her	8674	“ Well , I set up in case you did come . I just have to load the file . Hold on . It ’s here somewhere . ”
217120	217134	217112	217112	I	884	“ Perhaps you could tell me what ’s on it while we wait . ”
217135	217144	217145	217145	She	8674	“ Oh , I could n’t do that . ”
217152	217184	217185	217185	She	8674	“ You wo n’t believe it until you see it . But trust me . It will change everything you know about Hudson . He ’s a liar , you know . ”
217214	217225	217226	217226	I	884	“ He ’s not a liar . I trust him . ”
217247	217252	217253	217253	Her	8674	“ You ’ll see . ”
217282	217288	217289	217289	Stacy	8674	“ Ah ! Found it ! ”
217298	217317	217289	217289	Stacy	8674	“ Are you sure you do n’t want anything before I start this ? Water ? Iced tea ? ”
217334	217342	217318	217318	I	884	“ I said , no thank you . ”
217343	217346	217347	217347	She	8674	“ Popcorn ? ”
217350	217366	217347	217347	She	8674	“ I always like popcorn when I ’m watching TV . Popcorn and M&M ’s . ”
217367	217403	217318	217318	I	884	“ Look , Stacy , this is n’t entertainment for me . You say you have something that will make me feel differently about Hudson . Do you think I ’m looking forward to this ? ”
217472	217484	217467	217467	I	884	“ I should n’t be here . I have to go . ”
217491	217501	217467	217467	I	884	“ No ! Wait ! It ’s already playing . ”
217546	217582	217544	217544	Hudson	1556	“ I want you , precious . Whatever it takes to make that happen . Whatever I have to do . Whatever I have to say . I have to have you in my life . ”
217608	217618	217595	217595	He	3226	“ Is this some kind of a sick joke ? ”
217619	217624	217625	217625	Stacy	8674	“ Just be patient . ”
217680	217698	217661	217661	she	8674	“ Whatever I have to say , precious . I have to have you in my life . ”
217904	217910	217911	217911	I	884	“ Show me , dammit , ”
217917	217925	217911	217911	I	884	“ Show me what you ’re hiding ! ”
218157	218159	218152	218152	His	3232	“ off ”
218607	218612	218613	218613	Hudson	1556	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
218724	218729	218710	218710	He	676	“ Are you okay ? ”
218797	218812	218789	218789	I	884	“ I just had a bad dream , and now I ca n’t sleep . ”
218819	218826	218813	218813	His	676	“ Want to talk about it ? ”
218837	218843	218827	218827	I	884	“ Yes . But later . ”
218844	218847	218848	218848	He	676	“ Hmm . ”
218860	218875	218848	218848	He	676	“ How about I get a hot bath going for you in the meantime ? ”
218876	218881	218848	218848	He	676	“ That sounds heavenly . ”
218949	218959	218943	218943	He	676	“ Those are naughty thoughts clouding those brown eyes . ”
218973	218979	218966	218966	I	884	“ Are you joining me ? ”
218980	218990	218960	218960	My	884	“ In the naughty thoughts or in the tub ? ”
218998	219002	218991	218991	I	884	“ The tub . ”
219003	219011	218991	218991	I	884	“ I ’ll join you in both . ”
219245	219250	219237	219237	He	676	“ This is nice . ”
219251	219257	219258	219258	My	884	“ The temperature is perfect . ”
219274	219280	219281	219281	Hudson	1556	“ I meant holding you . ”
219296	219302	219281	219281	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ve missed this . ”
219628	219636	219625	219625	I	884	“ We have stuff to work through . ”
219651	219655	219637	219637	His	676	“ We do ? ”
219656	219660	219661	219661	I	884	“ We do . ”
219670	219679	219661	219661	I	884	“ Who ’s going to run your club ? ”
219685	219688	219680	219680	His	676	“ You . ”
219921	219929	219909	219909	My	884	“ And what happens next with Celia ? ”
219936	219947	219930	219930	His	180	“ Really ? You want to talk about Celia now ? ”
219948	219971	219972	219972	I	884	“ I never want to talk about her . But I need to know that she is n’t a threat to me . ”
219983	219987	219972	219972	I	884	“ To us . ”
220007	220010	220011	220011	Hudson	1556	“ Hey . ”
220019	220059	220011	220011	Hudson	1556	“ She ’s not a threat . She has no solid proof of her claims , and she ’s not pressing charges . Even if she did , I ’d still be here with you . You know that . ”
220064	220071	220060	220060	I	884	“ But what about going forward ? ”
220072	220095	220060	220060	I	884	“ Simple . We do n’t see her . We do n’t speak to her . We do n’t answer her emails . ”
220096	220101	220060	220060	I	884	“ We do n’t ? ”
220120	220140	220118	220118	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , we . I do n’t have room in my life for anyone who is against us . ”
220150	220161	220162	220162	I	884	“ Your mother is against us too , you know . ”
220215	220219	220220	220220	Hudson	1556	“ I know . ”
220229	220258	220220	220220	Hudson	1556	“ At least she has n’t tried to sabotage us . If she does , I ’m done with her . You ’re the only one that matters . ”
220259	220263	220264	220264	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
220269	220298	220264	220264	I	884	“ But I hope it does n’t come to that . It would be nice to believe that there could one day be reconciliation where Sophia is concerned . ”
220370	220386	220362	220362	her	9246	“ But why did she do it , Hudson ? Why was Celia against us ? ”
220387	220393	220394	220394	His	1286	“ Not us . Me . ”
220398	220405	220394	220394	His	1286	“ She ’s mad at me . ”
220406	220418	220419	220419	My	884	“ Still ? For what you did all those years ago ? ”
220457	220508	220509	220509	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t care what you did to her — she ’s a bitch . It was awful and terrible and horrible to do what she did . Especially when she claims to be your friend . Is she still in love with you ? Is that her problem ? ”
220514	220533	220509	220509	Hudson	1556	“ If she thinks she loves me , hurting you is n’t the way to win my affection . ”
220534	220545	220509	220509	Hudson	1556	“ Well , she certainly acts like a jealous lover . ”
220546	220550	220551	220551	He	1286	“ Without reason . ”
220559	220574	220551	220551	He	1286	“ Celia and I have never had anything together . Nothing . Except for … ”
220579	220592	220551	220551	He	1286	“ Except for what I made her believe I felt for her . ”
220593	220601	220602	220602	I	884	“ She knows that was n’t real . ”
220610	220669	220602	220602	I	884	“ And that was forever ago , now . If she ’s trying to get you back , it seems she already did that when she slept with your father and trapped you into claiming to be the father of her baby instead of Jack . Why did n’t you tell me about that , by the way ? ”
220670	220675	220676	220676	His	1286	“ I should have . ”
220683	220690	220676	220676	His	1286	“ Yes , you should have . ”
220755	220768	220742	220742	Hudson	1556	“ It did n’t feel like it was my secret to tell . ”
220769	220776	220777	220777	I	884	“ Okay , that ’s fair . ”
220820	220866	220809	220809	I	884	“ But some things have to change between us . We have to be able to share these things with each other . You could have at least told me you had good reasons not to trust her , reasons I should n’t trust her . ”
220867	220883	220968	220968	He	884	“ And you could have honored my wishes when I said do n’t see her . ”
220884	220891	220892	220892	I	884	“ Yes , I could have . ”
220898	220967	220892	220892	I	884	“ We both have to change . We have to put everything on the line , Hudson , as much as possible . We know now that we ’re together , thick and thin , right ? We have to trust that more than anything . We ca n’t be afraid of our secrets and our pasts . Both of us . Honesty , open doors , transparency . ”
220973	220976	220968	220968	He	884	“ Nakedness ? ”
220984	220991	220979	220979	I	884	“ You ’re such a perv . ”
220992	220996	220997	220997	He	884	“ I agree . ”
221011	221021	220997	220997	He	884	“ I am a perv where you ’re concerned . ”
221039	221048	221022	221022	I	884	“ Hudson , stop . I ’m serious . ”
221049	221053	221054	221054	He	884	“ I know . ”
221061	221077	221054	221054	He	884	“ And I agree with everything else you said . We need to be honest . ”
221078	221081	221082	221082	I	884	“ Good . ”
221096	221106	221082	221082	I	884	“ Hold on . I have one more thing . ”
221107	221112	221082	221082	I	884	“ Okay , what ? ”
221157	221165	221151	221151	my	884	“ What happened between you and Stacy ? ”
221166	221169	221170	221170	He	884	“ Stacy ? ”
221174	221179	221170	221170	He	884	“ Mirabelle ’s Stacy ? ”
221180	221183	221151	221151	my	884	“ Yeah . ”
221184	221188	221189	221189	He	884	“ Nothing happened . ”
221196	221227	221189	221189	He	884	“ What do you mean ? Like did I date her ? I took her to a charity event a year or so ago . But after that , nothing . ”
221228	221237	221238	221238	he	884	“ And I did n’t sleep with her , ”
221260	221279	221256	221256	she	3261	“ Is there a reason she ’d have a vendetta against you ? Or reason to distrust you ? ”
221286	221294	221280	221280	He	884	“ Not that I can think of . ”
221295	221305	221256	221256	she	3261	“ She was n’t one of your past victims ? ”
221306	221309	221310	221310	His	884	“ Victims ? ”
221314	221326	221310	221310	His	884	“ Is that what you call the people I played with ? ”
221330	221341	221327	221327	I	884	“ Maybe that was n’t the best choice of words ? ”
221342	221361	221256	221256	she	3261	“ No . It probably is the best choice . That does n’t make it pleasant to hear . ”
221362	221367	221327	221327	I	884	“ I ’m sorry . ”
221372	221394	221368	221368	His	884	“ Do n’t be . It ’s my past . I have to live with it . Why are you asking ? ”
221418	221473	221256	221256	she	3261	“ The last time we were at Mira ’s , Stacy told me that she had some sort of video . A video that proved something or other about you and Celia . She did n’t have it with her , so I gave her my phone number so she could contact me later . ”
221474	221485	221395	221395	I	884	“ The last time we were at Mira ’s together ? ”
221486	221508	221509	221509	I	884	“ Yeah . She cornered me while you were finding me shoes . Do you know what she ’s talking about ? ”
221525	221529	221531	221531	he	884	“ No idea . ”
221552	221564	221544	221544	I	884	“ She did n’t tell you what the video was of ? ”
221565	221586	221587	221587	I	884	“ No . Just that she had it and that it would show me why I could n’t trust you . ”
221592	221623	221587	221587	I	884	“ And she texted me again tonight . Or sometime this past week when I did n’t have a phone , and I did n’t get the message until tonight . ”
221642	221649	221638	221638	he	884	“ What did her text say ? ”
221650	221673	221587	221587	I	884	“ That the video was too big to send over the phone but to contact her if I wanted to see it . ”
221677	221685	221674	221674	He	884	“ Do you want to see it ? ”
221686	221689	221691	221691	I	884	“ No . ”
221696	221699	221691	221691	I	884	“ Yes . ”
221705	221714	221691	221691	I	884	“ I do n’t know . Should I ? ”
221715	221718	221719	221719	He	884	“ Well . ”
221727	221773	221719	221719	He	884	“ You know that Celia ca n’t be trusted already . And there is nothing that Stacy could have on me that you do n’t already know . You know more about my secrets and my past than anyone . You know me , Alayna . ”
221774	221778	221820	221820	I	884	“ I do . ”
221779	221788	221719	221719	He	884	“ Then unless you do n’t trust me … ”
221789	221807	221820	221820	I	884	“ I do trust you . If you say there ’s nothing I should be concerned about … ”
221814	221819	221808	221808	His	884	“ There is n’t . ”
221877	221887	221874	221874	I	884	“ Then I do n’t need to see it . ”
221976	221980	221968	221968	Hudson	1556	“ Thank you . ”
221981	221987	221968	221968	Hudson	1556	“ For what , exactly ? ”
221988	221995	221996	221996	He	884	“ For being open with me . ”
222001	222017	221996	221996	He	884	“ You did n’t have to tell me about that , and you did anyway . ”
222018	222029	222076	222076	They	3264	“ I ’m serious about being more open and honest . ”
222030	222063	222064	222064	His	884	“ I see that . I ’m serious about it too . The only way we can move on is to decide that we ’re committed to each other first and foremost . ”
222071	222075	222064	222064	His	884	“ Are we ? ”
222120	222124	222117	222117	I	884	“ I am . ”
222125	222129	222130	222130	He	884	“ So am I. ”
222559	222568	222569	222569	I	884	“ Do you always have to take over ? ”
222597	222609	222590	222590	His	884	“ If you want us both to come , then yes . ”
222637	222652	222634	222634	I	884	“ And who is it that would n’t come if I stayed in control ? ”
222653	222656	222657	222657	His	884	“ You . ”
222864	222867	222868	222868	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna . ”
222873	222880	222868	222868	Hudson	1556	“ What is it , precious ? ”
222944	222951	222952	222952	He	884	“ Alayna , talk to me . ”
222994	223003	222983	222983	He	884	“ Talk to me . What is it ? ”
223050	223058	223059	223059	I	884	“ You . Really . Hurt me , ”
223074	223078	223059	223059	I	884	“ Just now ? ”
223079	223082	223083	223083	I	884	“ No . ”
223094	223112	223083	223083	I	884	“ You really hurt me . With Celia . When you believed her . Instead of me . ”
223164	223169	223170	223170	He	884	“ Oh , Alayna . ”
223177	223193	223170	223170	He	884	“ Tell me . Tell me all of it . I need to hear it . ”
223194	223205	223206	223206	I	884	“ It hurts , Hudson . It hurts so much . ”
223212	223231	223206	223206	I	884	“ Even though you ’re here . Now . And we ’re together . There ’s a hole . ”
223239	223246	223206	223206	I	884	“ A deep , deep hole . ”
223264	223295	223253	223253	I	884	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry . If I could take it back , if I could change how I reacted … I would have chosen differently . ”
223296	223318	223319	223319	My	884	“ I know . I do . But you did n’t choose differently . And you ca n’t take that back . ”
223369	223377	223351	223351	I	884	“ You can never take that back . ”
223378	223385	223386	223386	He	884	“ No . I ca n’t . ”
223395	223405	223351	223351	I	884	“ And that changes things . It changes me . ”
223414	223417	223406	223406	He	884	“ How ? ”
223418	223426	223427	223427	I	884	“ It makes me vulnerable . Exposed . ”
223463	223475	223476	223476	I	884	“ And you know now . That you can hurt me . ”
223483	223491	223476	223476	I	884	“ You can hurt me real bad . ”
223492	223495	223496	223496	He	884	“ Alayna . ”
223509	223532	223496	223496	He	884	“ My precious girl . I never want to hurt you again . Will you ever be able to … forgive me ? ”
223638	223650	223628	223628	I	884	“ Huh . I do n’t know where that came from . ”
223662	223673	223651	223651	He	884	“ You needed to let it out . I understand . ”
223674	223678	223651	223651	He	884	“ You do ? ”
223679	223683	223684	223684	He	884	“ I do . ”
223692	223701	223684	223684	He	884	“ Is it okay that I ’m here ? ”
223702	223711	223712	223712	I	884	“ Yes ! Please , do n’t leave . ”
223722	223734	223684	223684	He	884	“ As long as you want me , I ’m here . ”
223735	223738	223739	223739	I	884	“ Good . ”
223751	223755	223756	223756	I	884	“ All that ? ”
223766	223771	223756	223756	I	884	“ That was just … ”
223772	223775	223739	223739	I	884	“ Healing ? ”
223776	223798	223799	223799	I	884	“ Yeah . Cathartic . The last step of all that before stuff . I think I have some closure now . ”
223819	223846	223847	223847	He	884	“ I admire your optimism , but old pain has a way of showing up from time to time , even when life is going well . ”
223855	223870	223847	223847	He	884	“ I ’m sure we ’ll both feel this way every now and then . ”
223899	223906	223907	223907	His	884	“ Do n’t dwell on it . ”
223912	223929	223907	223907	His	884	“ We have the future to make up for the hurts we ’ve caused each other . ”
223968	223981	223960	223960	I	884	“ This is a new beginning for us , is n’t it ? ”
223992	224008	223982	223982	He	884	“ No . This is better than a beginning . This is what happens next . ”
224009	224014	224055	224056	Three Hudson	1556	“ I like that . ”
224371	224384	224385	224385	he	884	“ We ’ve been pussy - footing around each other all day , ”
224391	224418	224385	224385	he	884	“ I ’m warning you now that I ’m done . It 's time for me to start treating you like what you are : Mine . "
224424	224439	224385	224385	he	884	“ And yes , that means that you ’ll be fucked later . Hard . ”
224771	224785	224736	224736	he	884	“ Is it true you ’ve bought back your old company , Plexis ? ”
224786	224789	224736	224736	he	884	“ Yes . ”
224790	224800	224736	224736	he	884	“ Are you planning to break the company apart ? ”
224801	224804	224736	224736	he	884	“ No . ”
224805	224818	224736	224736	he	884	“ Is this your current girlfriend ? Alayna Withers , is it ? ”
224819	224822	224736	224736	he	884	“ Yes . ”
224823	224829	224736	224736	he	884	“ What about Celia Werner ? ”
225019	225037	225013	225013	I	884	“ Do n’t you think it ’s rude to ask that when I ’m standing right here ? ”
225053	225106	225013	225013	I	884	“ He ’s with me now . Bringing up another woman in front of me is completely distasteful . If stirring up gossip is the only way you can write a decent story , I feel quite sorry for you . Do n’t bother rebutting . We have a party to attend . ”
225112	225118	225119	225119	He	3294	“ You heard the lady . ”
225152	225159	225147	225147	I	884	“ That was n’t so bad . ”
225175	225181	225182	225182	he	3294	“ It was mostly terrible , ”
225193	225205	225186	225186	I	884	“ I should n’t have said anything . I ’m sorry . ”
225206	225220	225182	225182	he	3294	“ Why ? You were the only reason it was n’t all terrible . ”
225221	225226	225227	225227	My	884	“ Well , then . ”
225231	225242	225227	225227	My	884	“ Maybe I should talk to the press more often . ”
225243	225249	225250	225250	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t push it . ”
225346	225359	225360	225360	He	3294	“ Why are we going if you hate these things so much ? ”
225367	225376	225360	225360	He	3294	“ Good question . Let ’s not go . ”
225377	225380	225381	225381	I	884	“ Hudson … ”
225440	225468	225429	225429	He	3294	“ I ’m here because Pierce Industries sponsors this event . I have to go . If I do n’t , it reflects poorly on the corporation . ”
225476	225495	225469	225469	I	884	“ Poor Hudson Alexander Pierce . Born into responsibility and obligation . Oh , and money and opportunity . ”
225505	225508	225496	225496	He	3294	“ Really ? ”
225509	225534	225537	225537	I	884	“ A little , yeah . If you ’re going to throw a pity party , H , I ’m not planning to attend . ”
225563	225589	225590	225590	He	3294	“ I ’m not throwing a pity party . It ’s impossible for anyone to feel sorry for me when you ’re at my side . ”
225604	225614	225590	225590	He	3294	“ Yeah , that ’s why people envy you . ”
225621	225635	225617	225617	me	884	“ If it ’s not , it ’s the reason that they should . ”
225659	225678	225699	225700	the man	3294	“ Good evening , Mr. Pierce . We ’re ready to cast off whenever you are , sir . ”
225682	225688	225689	225689	He	3294	“ Then let ’s go . ”
225738	225747	225748	225748	he	3294	“ I ’d rather not cause a scene , ”
225755	225768	225748	225748	he	3294	“ But have the crew keep an eye out for any trouble . ”
225769	225774	225748	225748	he	3294	“ Yes , sir . ”
225794	225799	225748	225748	he	3294	“ Is everything okay ? ”
225800	225803	225804	225804	His	3294	“ Fine . ”
225856	225865	225850	225850	I	884	“ Hudson , honesty and transparency … remember ? ”
225879	225893	225866	225866	He	3294	“ It ’s nothing . An uninvited guest arrived . That ’s all . ”
226011	226027	226004	226004	I	884	“ By the way , I meant to tell you that I got waxed yesterday . ”
226068	226071	226072	226072	Hudson	1556	“ Waxed ? ”
226088	226091	226093	226093	his	3294	“ Oh . ”
226141	226146	226125	226125	Hudson	1556	“ Tell me more . ”
226155	226169	226172	226172	I	884	“ I ’m talking waxed . Like , all the way . Bare . ”
226208	226223	226199	226199	Hudson	1556	“ Are you trying to make this the most uncomfortable night of my life ? ”
226224	226241	226199	226199	Hudson	1556	“ I was trying to give you something to look forward to , Mr. Grumpy Pants . ”
226242	226252	226199	226199	Hudson	1556	“ Mr. Strained Pants , I think you mean . ”
226256	226265	226253	226253	I	884	“ Is that going to be a problem ? ”
226266	226270	226271	226271	He	676	“ For you . ”
226287	226335	226271	226271	He	676	“ It ’s going to be a long evening . By the time I finally get to be inside you , I ’m going to need to be there for a long time . And I do n’t expect that I ’ll be able to be gentle . ”
226340	226345	226367	226367	he	676	“ No complaints here . ”
226346	226350	226351	226351	He	676	“ Good girl . ”
226370	226401	226367	226367	he	676	“ I ’ll try to improve my mood . Let ’s go . The sooner the socializing is over , the sooner I can bury my face between your thighs . ”
226558	226565	226566	226566	I	884	“ How many people are here ? ”
226583	226627	226569	226569	He	884	“ There were two hundred invited . They were each allowed one guest . We only take this many people out for the annual Macy ’s fireworks . There are fourteen staterooms , so we ’d never actually travel with this many aboard . ”
226653	226672	226642	226642	He	884	“ Except for a few other important people , we ’ll be the only ones sleeping here tonight . ”
226673	226682	226642	226642	He	884	“ Hopefully there wo n’t be much sleeping . ”
226699	226708	226642	226642	He	884	“ You ’ll pay for your teasing later . ”
226985	226992	226975	226975	I	884	“ Mira . You look adorable ! ”
226993	227004	227005	227005	She	1120	“ Ugh , thanks . I feel like a whale . ”
227017	227039	227005	227005	She	1120	“ Hello , brother . Glad to see you back in the States , though you ruined all my amazing planning . ”
227072	227079	227080	227080	she	1120	“ Not that I ’m complaining , ”
227087	227098	227080	227080	she	1120	“ You did good . I ’m proud of you . ”
227138	227144	227134	227134	Mira	8319	“ Did Adam abandon you ? ”
227152	227169	227134	227134	Mira	8319	“ Nah , he ’s finding me something nonalcoholic to drink . It ’s surprisingly difficult . ”
227170	227173	227176	227176	he	1131	“ Ah . ”
227217	227235	227202	227202	Mira	8319	“ Come . Sit . How did you manage to get a holiday off from the club ? ”
227247	227255	227236	227236	I	884	“ I ’m sleeping with the owner . ”
227256	227259	227260	227260	She	8319	“ Nice . ”
227271	227295	227260	227260	She	8319	“ I ’m such a dummy ! You were supposed to be in Japan . I guess you already got your shifts covered . ”
227296	227310	227311	227311	I	884	“ Yes . David and another manager are covering the next few days . ”
227336	227351	227329	227329	I	884	“ But I wo n’t be able to count on David after this week . ”
227358	227361	227362	227362	Mira	8319	“ Why ? ”
227378	227388	227365	227365	I	884	“ Hudson transferred him to Adora in Atlantic City . ”
227397	227406	227389	227389	Mira	8319	“ Seems like there ’s a story there . ”
227416	227441	227407	227407	Hudson	1556	“ You actually have him for two more weeks . I asked him to stay a little longer while we look for his replacement . ”
227471	227485	227464	227464	Mira	8319	“ Look for his replacement ? Why Laynie , of course . Duh . ”
227486	227489	227490	227490	I	884	“ Um … ”
227551	227559	227538	227538	She	8319	“ Another story , I ’m supposing . ”
227560	227569	227570	227570	I	884	“ Yeah . Let ’s not go there . ”
227576	227590	227570	227570	I	884	“ This guy ’s cranky as it is . Jet lag and everything . ”
227591	227611	227612	227612	She	8319	“ Got it . You look gorgeous , by the way . That ’s not one of mine though . ”
227617	227620	227658	227658	She	8319	“ Whoops . ”
227661	227672	227658	227658	She	8319	“ You ’re coming to my Grand Reopening , right ? ”
227710	227717	227699	227699	Mirabelle	1120	“ Sure . When is it ? ”
227718	227725	227726	227726	She	8319	“ You did n’t tell her ? ”
227734	227740	227699	227699	Mirabelle	1120	“ It slipped my mind . ”
227741	227750	227754	227754	she	8319	“ Hudson , you are such an ass ! ”
227757	227768	227754	227754	she	8319	“ The twenty - second . It ’s a Saturday . ”
227769	227791	227792	227792	I	884	“ I ’ll have to make sure someone else closes the night before , but that should n’t be a problem . ”
227820	227823	227824	227824	Her	8319	“ Oh ! ”
227828	227847	227824	227824	Her	8319	“ Will you be one of my models ? Please say yes . Please , please , please . ”
227848	227853	227862	227863	the girl	1136	“ Um , sure ? ”
227885	227901	227862	227863	the girl	1136	“ What does it involve ? Like , do I have to walk a runway ? ”
227902	227972	227824	227824	Her	8319	“ Do n’t be silly . I did n’t remodel that much . Okay , it ’s a small runway but not like what you ’re thinking . It ’s almost nothing . I ’m simply showing off a few of my favorite looks for publicity . So I just need you to stand there and look gorgeous in one of my outfits while people take pictures of you . ”
227983	227990	227824	227824	Her	8319	“ Okay . I ’m in . ”
227991	228010	227824	227824	Her	8319	“ Awesome ! Can you come by sometime to get fitted ? Like next Monday ? Around one ? ”
228060	228066	228067	228067	Mira	8319	“ Why are you hesitating ? ”
228071	228092	228095	228095	Stacy	8674	“ Sorry . I was running through my schedule in my mind . Yes . I can be there then . ”

228158	228161	228162	228162	I	884	“ Jack ! ”
228186	228196	228162	228162	I	884	“ I did n’t realize you ’d be here . ”
228197	228203	228204	228204	Hudson	1556	“ He was n’t invited . ”
228271	228282	228248	228248	Jack	10551	“ I ’m a Pierce . My invitation ’s standing . ”
228290	228298	228287	228287	Jack	10551	“ Hudson is n’t speaking to me . ”
228347	228356	228336	228336	He	10551	“ Oh , I suppose he is n’t . ”
228367	228373	228336	228336	He	10551	“ Is Sophia with you ? ”
228379	228388	228374	228374	Jack	10551	“ She ’s not speaking to me either . ”
228389	228394	228395	228395	Mira	8319	“ Serves you right . ”
228422	228442	228416	228416	Jack	10551	“ Ca n’t figure out what I have to do to get this one to stop speaking to me . ”
228443	228446	228416	228416	Jack	10551	“ Daddy ! ”
228452	228481	228447	228447	He	10551	“ I ’m teasing , pumpkin . You ’re the light of my life , and you know it . Here , I brought you a virgin daiquiri . ”
228495	228510	228482	228482	Mira	8319	“ I ’m not exactly happy with you these days myself , you know . ”
228514	228553	228511	228511	Jack	10551	“ I know . Chandler ’s keeping your mother company tonight so she ’s not alone . You ’re a sweet girl to be worried about her . I ’ll try to make it up to you sometime . ”
228554	228566	228567	228567	Mira	8319	“ It ’s not me you need to make up to , ”
228590	228595	228582	228582	Jack	10551	“ How are you ? ”
228596	228626	228627	228627	Jack	10551	“ I ’m good . And I ’m so glad to see you . I wanted to thank you . For being my support when all that went down . ”
228676	228701	228702	228702	He	10551	“ It was nothing , Laynie . I knew whom we were dealing with . I would have thought others here would have too . ”
228753	228778	228779	228779	I	884	“ To be fair , you do n’t know me quite as well as others here do either . But anyway , thank you . ”
228789	228792	228793	228793	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna … ”
228845	228856	228834	228834	his	1626	“ Jealousy does n’t look good on you , son . ”
228887	228893	228882	228882	Jack	10551	“ Did he just growl ? ”
228924	228948	228949	228949	He	1626	“ Obviously I ’d love to talk more , Jack , but it does n’t seem like it would be a good idea . ”
228966	228973	228976	228976	he	1626	“ No , it does n’t . ”
228987	229024	228976	228976	he	1626	“ I ’m glad you ’re still here . In his life , I mean . Even though he ’s a stubborn oaf that blames me for all the wrongs in my relationship with his mother — ”
229025	229036	229037	229037	Hudson	1556	“ Are you saying that you are n’t at fault ? ”
229046	229053	229040	229040	Jack	10551	“ He ’s speaking to me ! ”
229059	229064	229054	229054	Hudson	1556	“ Ah , Jesus . ”
229065	229105	229106	229106	His	10551	“ Anyway , I ’m glad you ’re with him , Laynie . He needs you more than he probably realizes . And there ’s no doubt he recognizes your worth . That boy has real feelings for you . ”
229112	229119	229106	229106	His	10551	“ Look . He ’s blushing . ”
229120	229124	229125	229125	Mira	8319	“ He is ! ”
229139	229144	229146	229146	Hudson	1556	“ I am not . ”
229160	229174	229157	229157	Jack	10551	“ See ? His love for you is written all over his face . ”
229187	229195	229175	229175	Hudson	1556	“ Could you stop pawing my girlfriend ? ”
229251	229269	229242	229242	I	884	“ I ’ll have to tell you more how appreciative I am when we get together sometime . ”
229270	229280	229281	229281	Hudson	1556	“ No , no , no . Not happening , ”
229287	229307	229308	229308	He	10551	“ Look at you rile him up on purpose . You ’re a wicked little woman , Alayna Withers . ”
229330	229333	229308	229308	He	10551	“ Perfect . ”
229334	229344	229345	229345	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s it . We ’re done here . ”
229353	229357	229358	229358	I	884	“ Talk later , ”
229364	229367	229368	229368	Mira	8319	“ Monday ! ”
229488	229494	229495	229495	he	3363	“ What was that for ? ”
229504	229508	229495	229495	he	3363	“ No reason . ”
229523	229541	229515	229515	He	3363	“ You know there ’s no reason to be jealous of me and your father , right ? ”
229542	229546	229547	229547	He	3363	“ Uh huh . ”
229564	229575	229515	229515	He	3363	“ He ’s attractive . I wo n’t deny that . ”
229576	229580	229581	229581	He	3363	“ Not helping . ”
229614	229647	229606	229606	I	884	“ There ’s nothing between us . No chemistry at all . And if you stopped wanting me , I ’d never retaliate against you like that . I ’m not Celia . ”
229653	229670	229648	229648	He	3363	“ I know you ’re not Celia . You do n’t think I fucking know that ? ”
229679	229684	229671	229671	His	3363	“ I … didn’t … ”
229697	229720	229685	229685	He	3363	“ And do n’t talk about me not wanting you . Ever . It ’s not even a breath of a possibility . ”
229734	229741	229721	229721	I	884	“ Okay . I wo n’t . ”
229747	229751	229752	229752	He	3363	“ Thank you . ”
229769	229789	229752	229752	He	3363	“ The fireworks are getting ready to start . I have a spot reserved for us at the bow . ”
229790	229794	229795	229795	I	884	“ The bow ? ”
229803	229817	229819	229819	his	3363	“ The front of the yacht . We ’ll have an excellent view . ”
229841	229844	229845	229845	I	884	“ Awesome . ”
229863	229881	229845	229845	I	884	“ I need to use the restroom before the show starts . I ’ll meet you there ? ”
229893	229913	229914	229914	He	3363	“ Use the one in our stateroom . No lines . Number Three . It ’s just in there . ”
229924	229944	229914	229914	He	3363	“ Oh , and when you come back , I ’d like you not to be wearing any panties . ”
229955	229961	229945	229945	I	884	“ You got it , H. ”
230223	230227	230228	230228	He	3363	“ Come here . ”
230291	230294	230295	230295	he	3363	“ Good , ”
230298	230302	230295	230295	he	3363	“ You obeyed . ”
230505	230511	230501	230501	I	884	“ What are you doing ? ”
230512	230517	230518	230518	His	3363	“ Setting off fireworks . ”
230571	230574	230575	230575	he	3363	“ Spread , ”
230652	230670	230639	230639	Hudson	1556	“ Ever since you told me you were bare , I ’ve been thinking about touching you . ”
230723	230746	230710	230710	He	3363	“ God , precious , I could n’t keep my hands off you if I tried . You ’re so slick already . ”
230747	230750	230710	230710	He	3363	“ Hudson . ”
230786	230805	230781	230781	Hudson	1556	“ If you want to come , Alayna , you have to promise me you can be quiet . ”
230806	230809	230818	230818	me	884	“ Okay . ”
230838	230853	230854	230854	he	3363	“ Do you know what it does to me to see you come apart ? ”
230865	230869	230854	230854	he	3363	“ Do you ? ”
230878	230881	230882	230882	I	884	“ No , ”
230889	230896	230897	230897	He	3363	“ It drives me fucking insane . ”
230999	231029	230990	230990	his	3363	“ Sometimes it ’s all I think about . Taking you to the edge . Watching you spill over . It ’s the most goddamned beautiful thing there is . ”
231073	231087	231054	231054	I	884	“ Bite on your hand to stifle your screams if you need to . ”
231128	231131	231132	231132	he	3363	“ Hand , ”
231260	231266	231267	231267	I	884	“ Take me to bed , ”
231334	231339	231324	231324	Hudson	1556	“ Jesus , woman . ”
231436	231440	231431	231431	I	884	“ shooting daggers . ”
232010	232025	231998	231998	He	3390	“ Turn around and kneel above my face . I have to lick you . ”
232161	232168	232169	232169	he	3390	“ You smell so fucking good , ”

233061	233076	233051	233051	I	884	“ Seriously . How does sex with you just keep getting better and better ? ”
233085	233094	233077	233077	Hudson	1556	“ We ’ve learned to trust each other . ”
233095	233102	233077	233077	Hudson	1556	“ Is that what it is ? ”
233141	233150	233151	233151	He	3390	“ Yes . That ’s what it is . ”
233162	233168	233151	233151	He	3390	“ Did I hurt you ? ”
233169	233176	233177	233177	He	3390	“ In only the best ways . ”
233204	233217	233195	233195	I	884	“ I had no idea you were so into a shaved pussy . ”
233233	233255	233218	233218	He	3390	“ I ’ve never really cared . It ’s you I ’m into . Shaved , bushy — I’ll take you . ”
233259	233268	233269	233269	Bushy	367	“ I ’ve never been bushy with you . ”
233284	233296	233297	233297	His	3390	“ But you could be and I ’d be turned on . ”
233309	233318	233297	233297	His	3390	“ Jesus , now I ’m hard again . ”
233319	233325	233297	233297	His	3390	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
233326	233333	233334	233334	He	3390	“ No . I ’m not . ”
233353	233362	233341	233341	I	884	“ You ’re such a horn - dog . ”
233363	233366	233368	233368	he	3390	“ Perhaps . ”
233568	233573	233553	233553	I	884	“ I saw Celia . ”
233577	233584	233574	233574	Hudson	1556	“ And now I ’m soft . ”
233590	233597	233574	233574	Hudson	1556	“ No , you ’re not . ”
233598	233611	233574	233574	Hudson	1556	“ It feels like I should be . Come on — Celia ? ”
233612	233621	233574	233574	Hudson	1556	“ Sorry . I thought you should know . ”
233622	233628	233629	233629	He	884	“ I suppose I should . ”
233632	233640	233629	233629	He	884	“ Did she bother you at all ? ”
233641	233676	233679	233679	I	884	“ No . I did n’t talk to her . It was as we were coming down here . I think she was watching . On the deck above . When … you know . ”
233698	233709	233679	233679	I	884	“ When I made you come all over my hand ? ”
233729	233734	233679	233679	I	884	“ Yeah , then . ”
233735	233742	233743	233743	His	884	“ Hope she enjoyed the show . ”
233778	233806	233769	233769	he	884	“ It was n’t Jack you were referring to who was the uninvited guest , was it ? It was Celia . How did she get here ? ”
233816	233861	233807	233807	Hudson	1556	“ She came with one of the men in my advertising department . He ’s always been interested in her and she ’s never given him a second look . I ’m sure she used his crush simply to get on - board tonight . ”
233883	233894	233875	233875	he	884	“ Why does she want to be here so badly ? ”
233895	233924	233925	233925	He	884	“ Maybe she wanted to see if we were still together . I do n’t know . You know more about that kind of obsession than I do . ”
233967	233979	233980	233980	I	884	“ Somehow your attention validates her . Makes her feel alive . ”
234011	234030	234001	234001	Hudson	1556	“ Do you think I ’m being too cruel to her by cutting her out of my life ? ”
234031	234034	234042	234042	she	1556	“ No . ”
234072	234081	234062	234062	she	1556	“ Does that make me a shitty person ? ”
234082	234085	234087	234087	he	884	“ No . ”
234228	234254	234213	234213	I	884	“ She ’s never really going to be out of our lives , is she ? She ’s always going to try to destroy us . ”
234264	234270	234271	234271	He	676	“ It does n’t matter . ”
234282	234316	234271	234271	He	676	“ You belong to me , precious . You belong with me . I wo n’t let anything come between us . I wo n’t let anything hurt you . Especially not her . ”
234433	234441	234427	234427	I	884	“ Now I ’m turned on again . ”
234467	234476	234454	234454	He	676	“ So we can stop talking about her ? ”
234492	234499	234477	234477	He	676	“ We can stop talking period . ”
234614	234619	234620	234620	he	676	“ Stop rushing me , ”
234965	234980	234952	234952	his	676	“ I ’ve been thinking about who ’s going to manage The Sky Launch . ”
234981	234984	235000	235000	his	676	“ You . ”
235006	235010	235003	235003	I	884	“ No pressure . ”
235011	235022	235023	235023	He	676	“ Yes , pressure . Lots and lots of pressure . ”
235031	235056	235023	235023	He	676	“ I want you to run the club . I ’ve always wanted you to run the club . I ’ve told you that . ”
235065	235079	235057	235057	I	884	“ I know . And that ’s what I ’ve been thinking about . ”
235080	235084	235025	235025	his	676	“ Go on . ”
235085	235111	235057	235057	I	884	“ I want to do it . I do . And I think I have the ideas and the marketing sense to pull it off . ”
235112	235116	235025	235025	his	676	“ You do . ”
235172	235205	235144	235144	Hudson	1556	“ I adore that you think so highly of me , H , but I ’m still lacking practical experience . Which was what I was looking forward to learning from David . ”
235220	235238	235206	235206	Hudson	1556	“ David would have held you back . You have more genius in your little pinky than — ”
235250	235262	235239	235239	I	884	“ Stop it . Your perception of my abilities is tainted . ”
235284	235289	235271	235271	he	676	“ It ’s not . ”
235290	235293	235263	235263	He	676	“ Anyway . ”
235355	235374	235345	235345	Hudson	1556	“ I want to run the club . And I ’m telling you yes to running the club — ”
235380	235383	235375	235375	His	676	“ Yes ? ”
235384	235390	235375	235375	His	676	“ But on one condition . ”
235391	235406	235375	235375	His	676	“ That I also give you my body and soul ? If you insist ... ”
235415	235439	235407	235407	I	884	“ I want to hire another full - time manager to share the load . Someone with the experience I do n’t have . ”
235443	235479	235440	235440	He	676	“ I do n’t see a problem with that . But I ’d still want you to be the point person . And , hell , I ’ll still throw in my body and soul . ”
235480	235489	235490	235490	I	884	“ Fine . That ’s what I want . ”
235502	235513	235490	235490	I	884	“ I mean I want to be the point person . ”
235514	235524	235525	235525	He	676	“ You do n’t want my body and soul ? ”
235534	235538	235539	235539	I	884	“ Shut up , ”
235542	235548	235539	235539	I	884	“ I already have that . ”
235549	235554	235555	235555	He	676	“ That you do . ”
235570	235588	235555	235555	He	676	“ Go ahead and put an ad out today . Unless you already have someone in mind ? ”
235589	235595	235600	235600	me	884	“ That ’s just it . ”
235626	235629	235600	235600	me	884	“ What ? ”
235655	235725	235765	235765	He	884	“ Well , there ’s no one at the club qualified . No one who knows more than I do . And if I put an ad out and got resumes … I just do n’t think I ’m going to find the type of person I ’m looking for . Especially not as quickly as I need them . But maybe you , with your connections and everything … ”
235726	235734	235765	235765	He	884	“ You want me to find someone ? ”
235740	235743	235735	235735	I	884	“ Yes . ”
235744	235747	235765	235765	He	884	“ Done . ”
235748	235764	235735	235735	I	884	“ I have n’t even told you the type of person I ’m looking for . ”
235768	235773	235765	235765	He	884	“ Then tell me . ”
235819	235923	235812	235812	I	884	“ I ’m thinking someone who has a history of managing a club or a restaurant , even . Someone with a resume . Someone who would know the right numbers for what should be incoming and outgoing and could handle the staff . I ’d want to do most of the marketing and behind - the - scenes business while he or she would work more of the day - to - day operations . Or night - to - night operations , I guess is a better way to put it . Would you be able to find someone like that ? ”
235924	235933	235808	235810	his point person	3433	“ When would you want them to start ? ”
235934	235946	235812	235812	I	884	“ Immediately . That way David could help with the training . ”
235947	235955	235808	235810	his point person	3433	“ Like I said before , done . ”
235956	235959	235960	235960	I	884	“ Really ? ”
235998	236016	236043	236043	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , really . I already have someone in mind . I ’ll set something up . ”
236039	236042	236024	236024	I	884	“ Perfect . ”
236051	236066	236043	236043	Hudson	1556	“ You know all you have to do is ask and it ’s yours . ”
236088	236107	236077	236077	I	884	“ Actually , I do n’t know that , and honestly , that sort of makes me uncomfortable . ”
236116	236119	236108	236108	Hudson	1556	“ Why ? ”
236134	236155	236127	236127	I	884	“ I do n’t want to be the floozy manager who only gets things because she ’s fucking the owner . ”
236203	236302	236194	236194	He	884	“ First of all , I love that you ’re fucking the owner . Please do n’t stop . Second , that ’s not why you get things . You get things because you ’re qualified . If you ’d shown up to the interviews after the symposium , you would have had people fighting for you . But third , and most importantly , you get things from me because you ’re my other half . Everything that is mine is yours . My connections , my money , my influence — it ’s all half yours . ”
236401	236412	236398	236398	I	884	“ I do n’t know how to respond to that . ”
236421	236454	236413	236413	Hudson	1556	“ You are n’t ready for that , I know . But I needed to tell you . As for your response , how about you say you ’ll run our club ? ”
236455	236462	236413	236413	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ll run your club . ”
236463	236466	236413	236413	Hudson	1556	“ Ah — ”
236490	236497	236483	236483	I	884	“ I ’ll run our club . ”
236498	236512	236513	236513	He	3437	“ Now kiss me because you ’ve made me a very happy man . ”
236580	236586	236573	236573	I	884	“ Thank you , Hudson . ”
236631	236637	236622	236622	He	3437	“ No . Thank you . ”
236790	236794	236795	236795	David	180	“ Great meeting , ”
236804	236822	236795	236795	David	180	“ I ’m bummed I wo n’t get to see the fruit of all your work today . ”
236823	236834	236835	236835	I	884	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll keep you updated . ”
236874	236882	236911	236911	His	180	“ What ’s up with you today ? ”
236904	236910	236888	236888	David	180	“ What do you mean ? ”
236915	236940	236911	236911	His	180	“ I do n’t know if I can explain it . You ’re different today . More on fire , if that ’s possible . ”
236968	236987	236988	236988	He	180	“ Well , I did tell Hudson this morning that I ’d take your place when you leave . ”
236991	237003	236988	236988	He	180	“ Finally ! Now I can actually feel good about leaving . ”
237004	237020	236988	236988	He	180	“ Whatever . You ’ve been excited about Adora since Hudson gave you the job . ”
237021	237042	236988	236988	He	180	“ Mostly because I ’d thought Pierce was going to fire me . The promotion instead was a nice surprise . ”
237101	237123	237093	237093	I	884	“ So you only agreed to take Adora because you thought you ’d be fired from here if you did n’t ? ”
237124	237145	237146	237146	David	180	“ Come on , Laynie . Let ’s be honest . Pierce was n’t going to let me stay here . ”
237207	237234	237196	237196	I	884	“ But if he did — if that was n’t the issue — would you have still said yes ? Or would you have stayed here ? ”
237241	237315	237235	237235	David	180	“ I ’m not really sure , to be honest . Adora is the pinnacle of nightclubs . I ’d never have an opportunity like that on my own . And I think I ’ll do a good job there . There ’s a whole team of managers I ’ll be joining . I ’ll have flexibility and support that I ’ve never had before . It ’s sort of my dream job . ”
237329	237354	237320	237320	He	180	“ But it ’s hard to leave the things you love . The move means leaving my home and my friends . This place . ”
237360	237363	237355	237355	He	180	“ You . ”
237364	237367	237368	237368	I	884	“ David … ”
237412	237433	237407	237407	He	180	“ Do n’t laugh , but I used to have this fantasy that we ’d eventually run this place together . ”
237443	237452	237434	237434	I	884	“ I used to have that same fantasy . ”
237483	237486	237463	237473	this really cool duo who ran the hottest club in town	3450	“ Really ? ”
237487	237492	237463	237473	this really cool duo who ran the hottest club in town	3450	“ Yes , really . ”
237526	237550	237513	237513	I	884	“ I mean , seriously . This place needs two managers . It was silly that you did it alone for so long . ”
237551	237567	237617	237617	David	180	“ I was n’t really alone . The staff is full of great assistant managers . ”
237571	237598	237599	237599	I	884	“ That ’s not the same . Full - time commitment is what you need . I asked Hudson to find a partner for me today . ”
237606	237616	237599	237599	I	884	“ I do n’t want to do it alone . ”
237629	237638	237621	237621	He	180	“ Say the word and I ’ll stay . ”
237639	237651	237652	237652	My	884	“ I ca n’t ask you to do that , David . ”
237659	237663	237652	237652	My	884	“ You could . ”
237664	237676	237621	237621	He	180	“ No , I could n’t . And you know why . ”
237685	237730	237677	237677	He	180	“ I do . But in answer to your earlier question — if it were n’t for Pierce , I ’d never leave . You can pretend to interpret that any way you need to , but you know what I ’m really saying . ”
237731	237738	237739	237739	I	884	“ I … I’m … um . ”
237790	237807	237808	237808	He	180	“ You do n’t have to respond . I get it . You ’re with him . ”
237817	237825	237808	237808	He	180	“ I am with him . Completely . ”
237826	237834	237835	237835	David	180	“ And if you ’re ever not … ”
237976	237979	237980	237980	Mira	8319	“ Laynie ! ”
237988	237997	237980	237980	Mira	8319	“ Are you busy ? Can you talk ? ”
238006	238017	237998	237998	I	884	“ Of course I can talk . What ’s up ? ”
238018	238029	237998	237998	I	884	“ I was wondering if I could ask a favor . ”
238030	238041	238042	238042	I	884	“ On top of being a model at your event ? ”
238072	238091	238056	238056	She	1136	“ A different favor . Man , I ’m kind of needy these days , are n’t I ? ”
238092	238109	238112	238112	I	884	“ How about I refrain from answering that until you tell me what the favor is ? ”
238120	238162	238056	238056	She	1136	“ Fair enough . Dad wants to have lunch with me tomorrow . And I do n’t really want to be alone with his sorry ass . And I ’d love to see you . So would you consider joining us ? ”
238163	238169	238172	238172	Jack	10551	“ I ’d love to ! ”
238222	238235	238198	238198	he	10551	“ But why do n’t you want to be alone with him ? ”
238236	238315	238316	238316	Sophia	1858	“ He ’s trying to make up for all the crap with Celia . He does n’t get that I ’m not the one he needs to make up with . I do n’t really give a flying fig what he did or did n’t do or should have done . I just want him and Mom to grow up and act like adults for half a second . I mean , would n’t that be so nice ? ”
238322	238326	238316	238316	Sophia	1858	“ Keep dreaming . ”
238327	238369	238316	238316	Sophia	1858	“ I know , I know . Anyway , we ’re meeting at Perry Street at one . I ’ll call and add you to the reservation . Yay ! You turned something dreadful into something I ’m looking forward to ! ”
238370	238380	238399	238399	his	180	“ I ’m looking forward to it , too . ”
239041	239048	239049	239049	Trish	9246	“ He ’s in a meeting , ”
239057	239071	239049	239049	Trish	9246	“ I ’ll have him call you as soon as he ’s finished . ”
239253	239261	239262	239262	I	884	“ Up ahead , on the sidewalk , ”
239270	239276	239277	239277	She	9246	“ Do you see her ? ”
239307	239317	239299	239299	Jordan	655	“ I see her . Was she following you ? ”
239326	239334	239383	239383	He	655	“ Yes . How did you know ? ”
239335	239366	239383	239383	He	655	“ I spotted her this morning when I dropped you off at the club , but I was n’t certain it was her . We need to tell Mr. Pierce . ”
239367	239382	239383	239383	He	655	“ I plan to right now . Can you take me to his office ? ”
239544	239548	239549	239549	Trish	9246	“ Excuse me , ”
239554	239563	239549	239549	Trish	9246	“ Mr. Pierce is still with his appointment — ”
239564	239571	239572	239572	I	884	“ He knows I ’m coming , ”
239598	239605	239606	239606	He	3482	“ It ’s okay , Patricia . ”
239632	239646	239620	239620	he	3482	“ I got your text . What ’s wrong ? Are you hurt ? ”
239647	239653	239654	239654	I	884	“ No , not hurt . ”
239671	239678	239620	239620	he	3482	“ Alayna , what is it ? ”
239692	239703	239679	239679	I	884	“ I need to show you something . Can I — ”
239757	239773	239746	239746	My	884	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . I did n’t realize you were n’t alone . ”
239787	239794	239774	239774	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , you remember Norma . ”
239795	239812	239818	239818	I	884	“ Yeah , I do . Norma Anders . We met at the Botanic Gardens event . ”
239907	239913	239914	239914	Norma	10443	“ We did meet then . ”
239947	239958	239938	239938	She	10443	“ It ’s good to see you again , Alayna . ”
239973	239987	239965	239965	She	10443	“ If you two need to talk alone , we can step out . ”
240102	240121	240093	240093	I	884	“ No , no . I apologize for bursting in . It ’s not like me to interrupt . ”
240130	240140	240141	240141	He	3492	“ Actually , Alayna , this is perfect timing . ”
240152	240173	240141	240141	He	3492	“ This is Norma ’s sister , Gwen . She ’s one of the managers at Eighty - Eighth Floor . ”
240174	240177	240179	240180	an employee	9304	“ Oh . ”
240219	240222	240212	240212	me	884	“ Oh ! ”
240238	240242	240243	240243	I	884	“ Alayna Withers , ”
240267	240273	240274	240274	She	816	“ Nice to meet you . ”
240407	240438	240398	240398	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ’s currently the Promotions Manager at The Sky Launch , but , as I told you , she ’ll become the General Manager once the current manager leaves . ”
240439	240451	240452	240452	Gwen	816	“ Hudson told me you ’re looking for an Operations Manager . ”
240475	240485	240472	240472	I	884	“ Is that something you might be interested in ? ”
240486	240489	240463	240464	her sister	3504	“ Definitely . ”
240547	240574	240535	240535	his	3505	“ She has all the qualifications I believe that you ’re looking for , Alayna . Perhaps you want to set up an interview for yourself ? ”
240575	240580	240581	240581	I	884	“ Yes . Definitely . ”
240617	240620	240621	240621	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ? ”
240625	240637	240638	240638	I	884	“ Sorry . Rough day . I ’m a bit flustered . ”
240663	240699	240648	240648	I	884	“ Would you be able to come into The Sky Launch tomorrow ? I think calling it an interview is a little too formal . I could show you around and we could talk then . ”
240700	240714	240724	240724	she	3506	“ Sounds perfect . I ’m off tomorrow so I ’m wide open . ”
240774	240785	240786	240786	I	884	“ Great . Then you can come by at eight . ”
240794	240805	240786	240786	I	884	“ You can see the club when it ’s open . ”
240806	240812	240849	240849	Norma	10443	“ I ’ll be there . ”
240813	240818	240819	240819	Hudson	1556	“ See , Norma ? ”
240825	240843	240819	240819	Hudson	1556	“ The kids did n’t need us after all . They worked everything out on their own . ”
241085	241092	241093	241093	I	884	“ Why exactly was Norma here ? ”
241131	241161	241122	241122	Hudson	1556	“ She arranged to have Gwen meet with me . I ’d never met her and Norma wanted to be here to acquaint us . Why do you ask ? ”
241162	241166	241167	241167	I	884	“ Just curious . ”
241177	241190	241167	241167	I	884	“ How did you know that Gwen worked at Eighty - Eighth ? ”
241201	241207	241191	241191	He	884	“ Norma ’s mentioned it . ”
241208	241221	241222	241222	I	884	“ Just in casual conversation . Between a boss and his employee ? ”
241247	241283	241239	241239	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , you ’re acting unusually jealous . While it ’s always a turn - on , I have a feeling it ’s a symptom of something else today . What ’s going on ? ”
241304	241332	241296	241296	I	884	“ It just seems strange that you would know such personal details about one employee when you have hundreds — thousands — of people working for you . ”
241333	241338	241353	241353	Hudson	1556	“ Hundreds of thousands . ”
241347	241352	241339	241339	I	884	“ Even stranger then . ”
241364	241374	241353	241353	Hudson	1556	“ What exactly are you asking me , Alayna ? ”
241428	241443	241411	241411	my	884	“ I ’m asking why you know personal details about Norma Anders ’ family . ”
241444	241464	241411	241411	my	884	“ You ’re asking what kind of relationship I ’ve had with Norma . The answer is strictly working . ”
241465	241472	241473	241473	My	884	“ Have you ever kissed her ? ”
241552	241569	241613	241613	His	3518	“ I do n’t make it a habit to kiss people I have working relationships with . ”
241580	241587	241570	241570	He	3518	“ Yes or no , please ? ”
241588	241612	241613	241613	His	3518	“ No , Alayna . I ’ve never kissed her . I ’ve never fucked her . I ’ve never anything with her . ”
241662	241755	241654	241654	He	3518	“ Since she ’s in the Financial Division , Norma handled the transaction when I purchased The Sky Launch so she knew I had the club . The other day she asked if there were any management positions available there . I told her no , but that I ’d keep Gwen in mind . I did n’t want to tell you about her because I was afraid if you knew , you ’d take that as a reason not to be the manager yourself . It ’s as simple as that . ”
241756	241761	241767	241767	he	3519	“ That makes sense . ”
241821	241839	241809	241809	He	3519	“ There ’s nothing with her , Alayna . I ’m with you . Always . Okay ? ”
241891	241901	241882	241882	I	884	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m being stupid . ”
241964	241993	241949	241949	He	3519	“ I know you would n’t be like this if something had n’t happened . And you came in here upset . What ’s going on , precious ? ”
242029	242036	242037	242037	I	884	“ Alayna , talk to me . ”
242052	242057	242037	242037	I	884	“ It ’s Celia . ”
242074	242080	242067	242067	His	3519	“ What did she do ? ”
242081	242087	242037	242037	I	884	“ She ’s following me . ”
242092	242101	242088	242088	His	3519	“ What do you mean , following you ? ”
242102	242119	242120	242120	I	884	“ Like , showing up where I am and going wherever I go . Following me . ”
242218	242222	242223	242223	He	3519	“ Fucking bitch ! ”
242236	242248	242223	242223	He	3519	“ I swear to god if she does anything to you … ”
242269	242280	242249	242249	Tears	370	“ What does she want from us ? From me ? ”
242292	242317	242281	242281	Hudson	1556	“ It does n’t matter . She ca n’t do this . I ’ll call my lawyer . We ’ll get a restraining order . ”
242329	242339	242323	242323	he	3519	“ Patricia , get Gordon Hayes on the phone . ”
242340	242346	242281	242281	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , Mr. Pierce . ”
242359	242366	242347	242347	I	884	“ It ’s not that simple . ”
242367	242386	242323	242323	he	3519	“ I do n’t care if it ’s simple or not . I ’m getting a restraining order . ”
242421	242469	242413	242413	me	884	“ Hudson , you ca n’t get a restraining order for simply being followed . She had a measurable distance , did n’t approach me , did n’t threaten me or pull any crap at any of the places I stopped . We have nothing on her . ”
242490	242508	242470	242470	His	3519	“ That ’s ridiculous . She has you scared . I can see it on your face . ”
242509	242527	242530	242530	I	884	“ Yes , she has me scared . But there ’s nothing you can do about it . ”
242575	242595	242564	242564	He	379	“ Trust me . I ’m well - versed in the art of terrorizing someone while evading police involvement . ”
242596	242603	242604	242604	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t talk like that . ”
242613	242643	242604	242604	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s the truth . I used to do this to people , Hudson ! It ’s horrible . How could I be this horrible to other people ? ”
242669	242675	242655	242655	Hudson	1556	“ Hush now , Alayna . ”
242687	242707	242676	242676	He	379	“ This is n’t the same . You were searching for love . Celia ’s actions are quite different . ”
242730	242750	242721	242721	I	884	“ Are they ? Is n’t she doing this because she wants your love ? How is that different ? ”
242762	242806	242751	242751	He	379	“ I do n’t believe that ’s why she ’s doing this . She means to keep me unhappy . She knows that hurting you would destroy me . This is payback for my past . This has nothing to do with yours . ”
242861	242916	242848	242848	I	884	“ I really do n’t care why she ’s doing it . She ’ll keep on doing it , though , because she ’s winning . You ’re down on yourself and I ’m a mess . I ’m paranoid and anxious and I ’m afraid I ’m reverting back to my old self . ”
242957	242993	242939	242939	He	884	“ You are n’t . You have valid reasons to feel this way today . She ’s thrown you off balance , but you ’ll get ahold of yourself . You ’re stronger than her . ”
243003	243010	242994	242994	I	884	“ I ’m strong with you . ”
243011	243034	242939	242939	He	884	“ And I ’m not leaving you . I ’m here . We ’re in this together . Do you hear me ? ”
243055	243061	243043	243043	Hudson	1556	“ Did you reach him ? ”
243062	243065	243066	243066	Trisha	9246	“ No . ”
243073	243092	243066	243066	Trisha	9246	“ I ’m sorry but Mr. Hayes has gone home for the evening . It ’s after five . ”
243099	243102	243103	243103	he	884	“ Shit , ”
243121	243132	243109	243109	I	884	“ I want him on the phone first thing tomorrow . ”
243133	243144	243111	243111	he	884	“ Yes , sir . Anything else before I leave ? ”
243145	243153	243154	243154	He	884	“ No . Thank you , Patricia . ”
243173	243194	243166	243166	He	884	“ She wo n’t win , Alayna . You kept it together in front of her , did n’t you ? ”
243195	243198	243205	243205	I	884	“ Yes . ”
243222	243242	243217	243217	He	884	“ Of course you did . You ’re incredible like that . Stronger than you give yourself credit for . ”
243286	243306	243265	243265	I	884	“ Celia has no idea if she hit her target or not . That puts us at an advantage . ”
243332	243342	243317	243317	I	884	“ What if she does n’t stop at stalking ? ”
243350	243379	243343	243343	His	884	“ Jordan is ex - military . Special ops . He can protect you . You can never go anywhere without him in the future . Promise me . ”
243380	243394	243343	243343	His	884	“ I rarely go anywhere without him now . Today was a fluke . ”
243395	243400	243401	243401	His	884	“ Just promise me . ”
243406	243410	243411	243411	I	884	“ I promise . ”
243463	243486	243499	243499	He	884	“ Good . I ’ll hire another bodyguard for when Jordan ’s not available . I know you did n’t want one — ”
243492	243498	243487	243487	I	884	“ I ’ll take it . ”
243505	243540	243499	243499	He	884	“ I ’ll bring someone in to check the security cameras at the club and make sure they ’re sufficient . The penthouse is already monitored . And I ’ll talk to my lawyer — ”
243545	243552	243541	243541	I	884	“ He ca n’t do anything . ”
243553	243581	243541	243541	I	884	“ I ’m talking to him anyway . I want to know our rights . If I have to throw money at the situation , I will . ”
243644	243651	243652	243652	Hudson	1556	“ Celia has money , too . ”
243658	243683	243652	243652	Hudson	1556	“ Money is only good in the right hands . I have no doubt that my power extends beyond her and the Werner family . ”
243754	243764	243749	243749	He	3532	“ Alayna , I ’ll take care of this . ”
243765	243769	243749	243749	He	3532	“ I know … ”
243788	243792	243770	243770	He	3532	“ But … ? ”
243793	243808	243811	243811	she	3536	“ She ’s never going to be out of our lives , is she ? ”
243860	243875	243851	243851	Hudson	1556	“ She will . I ’ll figure something out . Do you trust me ? ”
243876	243879	243851	243851	Hudson	1556	“ Yes . ”
243885	243896	243897	243897	He	3532	“ Then believe me — I’ll take care of her . ”
243909	243926	243897	243897	He	3532	“ In the meantime , stay with Jordan . No more outside runs for a while . ”
243974	244013	243970	243970	my	884	“ I ’ll just have Jordan run with me . I ’m sure he wo n’t mind . I know he ’s in good shape , and if he ’s Special Ops , he must do some running . ”
244014	244036	243970	243970	my	884	“ No . Not good enough . He ca n’t be on his best game when he ’s exerting himself physically . ”
244037	244043	244044	244044	I	884	“ I do n’t know , ”
244047	244061	244044	244044	I	884	“ You ’re on your best game when you ’re exerting yourself physically . ”
244062	244067	243970	243970	my	884	“ What was that ? ”
244068	244082	244083	244083	I	884	“ Nothing . I just do n’t want to live in a prison . ”
244098	244103	244104	244104	His	884	“ Alayna , please . ”
244111	244121	244104	244104	His	884	“ Just until I get a better plan together . ”
244144	244161	244133	244133	I	884	“ Okay . Fine . I ’ll keep my runs to the treadmill . For now . ”
244162	244166	244167	244167	Hudson	1556	“ Come here . ”
244179	244197	244167	244167	Hudson	1556	“ I only want you safe . I could n’t bear it if anything happened to you . ”
244252	244265	244269	244269	she	3540	“ Do you really think Celia would do something besides scare me ? ”
244314	244332	244306	244306	he	884	“ I do n’t know what she ’d do . I ’m not willing to find out . ”
244350	244357	244336	244336	his	884	“ Hudson , I ’m scared . ”
244377	244389	244358	244358	He	884	“ I ’m not , Alayna . Not in the least . ”
244439	244443	244444	244444	He	884	“ Trust me . ”
244455	244463	244444	244444	He	884	“ I ’ll take care of it . ”
244472	244480	244464	244464	He	884	“ I ’ll take care of you . ”
244616	244625	244603	244603	My	884	“ Do n’t stop . I need you . ”
244641	244644	244645	244645	His	884	“ Alayna … ”
244706	244713	244714	244714	I	884	“ I need you , Hudson . ”
244727	244735	244714	244714	I	884	“ Please . Please make it better . ”
244736	244741	244742	244742	he	884	“ Dammit , Alayna , ”
244745	244761	244742	244742	he	884	“ You ’re making it hard for me to do what I should be doing . ”
244768	244777	244778	244778	God	8844	“ I ’m trying to make it harder . ”
244797	244802	244794	244794	I	884	“ Hudson … please ! ”
244803	244806	244812	244812	he	884	“ Fuck . ”
244862	244868	244869	244869	he	884	“ Take off your panties , ”
244967	244970	244961	244961	I	884	“ Hudson . ”
244977	244981	244961	244961	I	884	“ I need — ”
244987	245002	244982	244982	He	884	“ I know what you need . Trust me to give it to you . ”
245046	245070	245039	245039	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re so eager , precious . It ’s going to hurt if you do n’t let me get you ready first . ”
245086	245095	245039	245039	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t care if it hurts . ”
245110	245114	245104	245104	I	884	“ Come on ! ”
245142	245173	245134	245134	he	884	“ It ’s hard enough to control myself around you as it is . If you give me permission , then you better believe you ’re going to get fucked . ”
245353	245361	245341	245341	He	884	“ Jesus , Alayna . Slow down . ”
245362	245371	245372	245372	I	884	“ No . Ca n’t . Want you . ”
245381	245392	245393	245393	He	884	“ I know . I know what to give you . ”
245399	245424	245393	245393	He	884	“ But if you do n’t let me take care of you , you are n’t going to get where you want to go . ”
245425	245428	245429	245429	I	884	“ Need , ”
245476	245485	245468	245468	His	884	“ Listen to me . Are you listening ? ”
245489	245494	245468	245468	His	884	“ Look at me . ”
245512	245538	245539	245539	He	884	“ You need to let me take charge , Alayna . You need to trust me . I ’m going to take care of you . ”
245555	245558	245548	245548	He	884	“ Okay ? ”
245630	245633	245634	245634	I	884	“ Okay , ”
245637	245646	245655	245655	he	884	“ Good . Now let ’s do this . ”
245669	245676	245655	245655	he	884	“ Hold on to the desk . ”
245751	245779	245780	245780	He	884	“ God , Alayna . Your pussy feels so good . So tight . You make me so hard . I ’m going to come so hard . ”
245855	245858	245859	245859	he	884	“ Better ? ”
245869	245874	245878	245878	I	884	“ Yes . Much . ”
245912	245922	245898	245898	I	884	“ I , um , I ’m sorry about — ”
245923	245926	245927	245927	He	884	“ Shh . ”
245937	245950	245927	245927	He	884	“ It ’s nice to be on the opposite side for once . ”
245951	245957	245958	245958	I	884	“ Well , thank you . ”
245970	245985	245927	245927	He	884	“ Anytime you need it , I ’m happy to fuck away your woes . ”
246388	246401	246410	246410	she	9246	“ She was always waiting , it seemed to be her forte . ”
246433	246437	246428	246428	she	9246	“ Good book ? ”
246475	246488	246467	246467	He	3553	“ Sorry , I did n’t mean to sneak up on you . ”
246489	246497	246498	246498	I	884	“ It ’s not that . Look . ”
246511	246537	246498	246498	I	884	“ I found this business card in this book — it ’s one of the ones you got me . And this quote is highlighted . ”
246561	246564	246547	246547	He	3553	“ Goddammit ! ”
246565	246571	246538	246538	I	884	“ What does it mean ? ”
246572	246576	246577	246577	He	3553	“ Who knows ? ”
246588	246614	246577	246577	He	3553	“ You know what ? Do n’t even think about it . That ’s what she wants . She wants it to mess with you . ”
246630	246635	246615	246615	He	3553	“ Have you eaten ? ”
246636	246648	246649	246649	I	884	“ I waited for you . It ’s in the warmer . ”
246660	246669	246649	246649	I	884	“ You took her key away , right ? ”
246676	246702	246703	246703	He	3553	“ She did n’t just leave that in your book now . This has to be from before . When she had the boxes delivered . ”
246741	246747	246720	246720	his	3553	“ Hudson — her key ? ”
246748	246757	246758	246758	He	3553	“ Yes . I took away her key . ”
246782	246791	246769	246769	He	3553	“ The day after she made the delivery . ”
246878	246893	246840	246840	she	3553	“ So there could be secret notes and messages in all of the books . ”
246910	246917	246894	246894	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ll replace them all . ”
246918	246927	246930	246930	I	884	“ You do n’t need to do that . ”
246954	246961	246949	246949	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ll do it anyway . ”
246997	247018	246983	246983	I	884	“ You got home late . Does that mean you came up with ideas on how to deal with her ? ”
247034	247042	247043	247043	he	3553	“ I have something in the works , ”
247050	247066	247043	247043	he	3553	“ But I ’d rather not talk about it , if you do n’t mind . ”
247067	247089	247101	247101	he	3553	“ Um , yes , I do mind . This affects me and I want to know what ’s going on . ”
247107	247149	247150	247150	His	3553	“ You know what you need to know . I ’ve hired security , the new cameras are being installed at the club tomorrow , and I have some preliminary ideas to try to make Celia lose interest in her game . ”
247164	247174	247157	247157	my	884	“ Ideas that you are n’t going to share ? ”
247175	247182	247150	247150	His	3553	“ No . I ’m not . ”
247208	247228	247157	247157	my	884	“ Hudson — transparency , honesty — remember ? Are you hiding something from me ? Is it illegal ? ”
247229	247242	247243	247243	He	3553	“ No . And no . And you said you trusted me . ”
247248	247251	247243	247243	He	3553	“ Remember ? ”
247252	247302	247157	247157	my	884	“ I do trust you . But we ’re supposed to be in this together and this is not together . This is you keeping me in the dark while you go play superhero . Or I assume you ’re playing superhero , because I do n’t really know . ”
247322	247341	247342	247342	He	3553	“ We are in this together , Alayna . And I ’ll tell you . Just not now . ”
247350	247362	247342	247342	He	3553	“ I ’d rather spend my evening with you . Alone . ”
247436	247445	247424	247424	I	884	“ Okay . No more talk of Celia . ”
247556	247562	247545	247545	Hudson	1556	“ Now you ’re quiet . ”
247566	247577	247563	247563	I	884	“ I do n’t know what else to talk about . ”
247649	247677	247645	247645	he	3553	“ Well , let ’s see . I know how today went . What ’s on your agenda for tomorrow ? You ’re interviewing Gwenyth , right ? ”
247678	247686	247695	247695	her	9246	“ Her name ’s Gwenyth ? Hmm . ”
247712	247720	247645	247645	he	3553	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
247721	247724	247725	247725	I	884	“ Nothing . ”
247746	247755	247737	247737	I	884	“ I ’ve heard you call her Gwen . ”
247759	247767	247756	247756	He	3553	“ That ’s what she goes by . ”
247768	247777	247786	247786	his	3553	“ You never call people by their nicknames . ”
247788	247800	247786	247786	his	3553	“ Are you suggesting it means something that I use hers ? ”
247801	247804	247786	247786	his	3553	“ No . ”
247813	247819	247786	247786	his	3553	“ I do n’t know . ”
247851	247861	247846	247846	my	884	“ I ’m just tense . I ’m sorry . ”
247862	247870	247871	247871	Hudson	1556	“ I know . I am too . ”
247879	247906	247871	247871	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t know why I call her Gwen . I knew her as that first . I suppose it ’s in my brain now . ”
247907	247915	247920	247920	he	3553	“ You do n’t need to explain . ”
247990	247994	247995	247995	I	884	“ About tomorrow … ”
247999	248010	247995	247995	I	884	“ I do have plans I should tell you about . ”
248011	248031	248032	248032	His	3553	“ You better not be planning a run in Central Park . Your new bodyguard will tackle you down . ”
248045	248083	247995	247995	I	884	“ I said I would n’t run outside . Trust me works both ways , you know . Do I get to meet this bodyguard ? Is he also very attractive but unavailable because he ’s gay ? ”
248087	248096	248084	248084	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s not even a little funny . ”
248106	248115	248097	248097	I	884	“ It totally is and you know it . ”
248116	248148	248084	248084	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ll introduce you on his shift tomorrow . He ’s not gay . And I trust you so I ’m not worried about whether or not he ’s attractive . ”
248149	248153	248097	248097	I	884	“ Good boy . ”
248154	248164	248165	248165	He	3553	“ Now what do you need to tell me ? ”
248189	248204	248179	248179	I	884	“ I ’m , um , having lunch with Mira tomorrow . And Jack . ”
248214	248220	248205	248205	Hudson	1556	“ What did you say ? ”
248248	248259	248234	248234	I	884	“ I ’m having lunch with your sister and father . ”
248260	248266	248267	248267	His	3553	“ Like hell you are . ”
248289	248308	248281	248281	I	884	“ I ’m guessing it ’s the Jack part that has you upset and not the Mira part . ”
248313	248332	248309	248309	His	3553	“ I ’m not upset about any of it because you are not having lunch with my father . ”
248345	248362	248342	248342	I	884	“ I ’m not sure you can tell me what I am and am not doing . ”
248363	248371	248309	248309	His	3553	“ Oh , yes , I can . ”
248382	248430	248372	248372	I	884	“ Hudson , this is ridiculous . I ’ve told you before , I ’m not Celia . I ’m not going to sleep with your father — even if he comes on to me . Which he wo n’t because your baby sister will be there . ”
248445	248457	248431	248431	He	884	“ Why do you even need to spend time with him ? ”
248458	248490	248431	248431	He	884	“ I do n’t need to . I did n’t plan to . Mira did n’t want to be alone with him , and so I offered to be a buffer . ”
248491	248512	248431	248431	He	884	“ She does n’t need a buffer . Cancel your date and have coffee with her later . Just Mira . ”
248531	248585	248522	248522	I	884	“ I do n’t want to cancel . I want to have lunch with Mira . And Jack . I like him . Not because I ’m into him , but because he ’s your father . And I do n’t have a father anymore and bonding with Jack makes me feel good . ”
248595	248645	248522	248522	I	884	“ Maybe he ’s not a great replacement , but he ’s the closest thing I have . Plus , knowing him helps me feel closer to you . And when you keep things from me , H , I need all the access to you I can get . ”
248646	248649	248705	248705	He	884	“ Alayna … ”
248655	248667	248651	248651	I	884	“ That last part was uncalled for . I ’m sorry . ”
248715	248741	248705	248705	He	884	“ I ’m not keeping things from you , Alayna . Really , I ’m not . I just want a night without … her . ”
248742	248746	248747	248747	I	884	“ I know , ”
248756	248780	248705	248705	He	884	“ And please , do n’t use my father to get close to me . He ’s not the road to my heart . ”
248781	248790	248705	248705	He	884	“ Where is the road to your heart ? ”
248804	248818	248795	248795	he	884	“ Do n’t you know ? You ’re the one who paved it . ”
248833	248850	248819	248819	I	884	“ Do n’t think I ’m going to cancel my lunch because you ’re being sweet . ”
248854	248911	248851	248851	He	884	“ Do n’t worry . I do n’t think that at all . Have lunch with him if that ’s what you want . At least I know you ’ll be safe from Celia with him around . They are n’t friendly anymore . And I would n’t deny you something that makes you feel good . ”
248927	248938	248921	248921	I	884	“ It ’s not your right to deny me anyway . ”
248944	248949	248939	248939	He	884	“ I hate that . ”
249031	249036	249017	249017	I	884	“ I love you . ”
249037	249050	249017	249017	I	884	“ And that ’s why I ’m letting you win this conversation . ”
249063	249067	249051	249051	I	884	“ Letting me ? ”
249068	249076	249017	249017	I	884	“ Please , indulge me a little . ”
249077	249082	249083	249083	I	884	“ How about this — ”
249091	249109	249083	249083	I	884	“ How about we cease conversation altogether and indulge in an activity where we can both win ? ”
249110	249117	249017	249017	I	884	“ Can we both win twice ? ”
249118	249133	249083	249083	I	884	“ Honey , we can win three times if you ’re up for it . ”
249151	249159	249142	249142	he	8844	“ Now that sounds like a plan . ”
249172	249194	249160	249160	Mira	8319	“ I just do n’t understand why he would n’t tell you what he ’s planning . It makes no sense . ”
249297	249318	249292	249292	I	884	“ Maybe he really did n’t want to talk about it anymore . He just seemed more elusive than that . ”
249337	249350	249334	249334	Mira	8319	“ You ’re afraid he ’s keeping something from you on purpose ? ”
249351	249354	249357	249357	I	884	“ No . ”
249363	249369	249357	249357	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
249385	249396	249370	249370	She	8319	“ I do n’t know either . I ’m sorry . ”
249404	249418	249397	249397	Her	8319	“ Why are you sorry ? You have no reason to be sorry . ”
249419	249425	249436	249436	she	8319	“ He ’s my brother . ”
249440	249455	249436	249436	she	8319	“ I feel like I should understand him better , and I do n’t . ”
249456	249461	249463	249463	anyone	645	“ No one does . ”
249480	249488	249489	249490	The waiter	2655	“ Are you ladies ready to order ? ”
249527	249539	249521	249522	The waiter	2655	“ Or would you prefer to wait for your other guest ? ”
249554	249559	249545	249545	She	8319	“ We ’ll wait . ”
249560	249564	249565	249566	The waiter	2655	“ Very good . ”
249607	249636	249598	249598	I	884	“ Here ’s the thing — I’m afraid the real reason he wo n’t tell me what he has planned is that he does n’t have anything planned . ”
249637	249645	249678	249678	Mira	8319	“ Would n’t he just admit that ? ”
249646	249649	249598	249598	I	884	“ No . ”
249669	249677	249598	249598	I	884	“ He wants me to feel safe . ”
249681	249687	249678	249678	Mira	8319	“ Of course he does . ”
249702	249764	249678	249678	Mira	8319	“ Laynie , he ’ll come up with something . I know it . And whatever it is , he ’ll do a good job . He ’ll be committed and he ’ll go to great lengths . This is probably a horrible comparison , but look how devoted he was to keeping Celia ’s secret . All to protect her . ”
249765	249772	249773	249773	Jack	10551	“ He was n’t protecting Celia . ”
249784	249809	249773	249773	Jack	10551	“ Sorry , I ’m late . Traffic . I did n’t realize you were joining us , Laynie . What a nice surprise ! ”
249820	249835	249836	249836	She	8319	“ Are you suggesting Hudson was protecting you ? Because that makes me sick . ”
249843	249852	249853	249853	he	10551	“ Oh , I know what I want , ”
249868	249887	249853	249853	he	10551	“ He was protecting your mother . He did n’t want her to get hurt from my infidelity . ”
249893	249913	249888	249888	Mira	8319	“ Still a valid comparison — Hudson will do far more for you than he ’d do for Mom . ”
249931	249947	249924	249924	she	8319	“ And you say that as if it were unreasonable that she would be hurt . ”
249948	249956	249957	249957	Jack	10551	“ It ’s unreasonable that he cares . ”
249987	249998	249970	249970	Mira	8319	“ Thank god he did n’t inherit heartlessness from you . ”
249999	250008	250016	250016	she	8319	“ No , he inherited that from Sophia . ”
250020	250026	250016	250016	she	8319	“ Would you just stop ? ”
250077	250108	250063	250063	Jack	10551	“ Mirabelle , I ’m not heartless . You think it ’s cruel that I cheated on your mother . It was . It is . I ’m not perfect . ”
250122	250146	250063	250063	Jack	10551	“ But you have to understand , sweetie , that Sophia is also culpable . She ’s not an easy woman to love . ”
250158	250167	250147	250147	Mira	8319	“ And do you love her , Daddy ? ”
250179	250191	250168	250168	Jack	10551	“ Yes . I do . Of course , I do . ”
250192	250198	250168	250168	Jack	10551	“ Do you tell her ? ”
250199	250203	250168	250168	Jack	10551	“ Every day . ”
250220	250230	250212	250212	She	8319	“ Actions speak louder than words , you know . ”
250270	250273	250258	250258	I	884	“ Sometimes . ”
250324	250334	250320	250320	I	884	“ Sometimes it would be nice to have both . ”
250363	250371	250372	250372	Jack	10551	“ And can I get a Manhattan ? ”
250379	250387	250372	250372	Jack	10551	“ For lunch , Dad ? Seriously ? ”
250388	250401	250372	250372	Jack	10551	“ Hey , I ’m not the one with the drinking problem . ”
250444	250451	250436	250436	Her	8319	“ But you certainly facilitate it . ”
250460	250471	250436	250436	Her	8319	“ Ca n’t you just have tea ? Or water ? ”
250472	250487	250488	250488	Jack	10551	“ Oh for the love of Pete . Your mother is n’t even here . ”
250503	250536	250488	250488	Jack	10551	“ Is it too tempting for you , my dear ? Because it does n’t look like you ’ve touched your water . I ’m sure you ’d rather have something stronger . ”
250547	250569	250537	250537	Mira	8319	“ I do n’t care what you drink . I ’m not thirsty . I ’m saving room for my meal . ”
250600	250610	250537	250537	Mira	8319	“ Now what is this about Celia and Hudson ? ”
250633	250639	250627	250627	Mira	8319	“ Can I tell him ? ”
250640	250647	250649	250649	he	10551	“ Oh my god , no . ”
250677	250683	250671	250671	Mira	8319	“ I ’m telling him . ”
250739	250756	250765	250765	Jack	10551	“ It ’s really not a big deal . I was overreacting to bring it up . ”
250757	250764	250721	250721	she	8319	“ No , you ’re not ! ”
250774	250788	250765	250765	Jack	10551	“ Mira ’s right . Celia is n’t a threat to take lightly . ”
250789	250796	250797	250797	I	884	“ See that guy over there ? ”
250809	250826	250797	250797	I	884	“ He ’s my new bodyguard . Believe me , we are n’t taking this lightly . ”
250841	250856	250857	250857	Jack	10551	“ Good . Hudson ’s taking her seriously . That makes me feel better . ”
250865	250868	250857	250857	Jack	10551	“ Why ? ”
250876	250884	250869	250869	He	10551	“ I care about you , Laynie . ”
250906	250936	250904	250904	him	10551	“ You ’re family now . You ’re an important part of Hudson ’s life and he — and I — would be devastated if anything happened to you . ”
250937	250948	250951	250951	his	10551	“ Thank you , Jack . I really appreciate that . ”
250972	250979	250965	250965	his	10551	“ I care about you too . ”
250987	250992	250980	250980	I	884	“ All of you . ”
251018	251054	251007	251007	I	884	“ What I meant though , is why does Celia worry you ? Why does she care so much about hurting me ? She acts like a jealous lover . Were she and Hudson together ? ”
251055	251059	251060	251060	Mira	8319	“ No way , ”
251069	251075	251060	251060	Mira	8319	“ They were never together . ”
251076	251099	251007	251007	I	884	“ But Hudson ’s so secretive . He might not have told either of you . You ca n’t know for sure . ”
251100	251115	251060	251060	Mira	8319	“ I know for sure . There ’s no way he was with her . ”
251134	251147	251131	251131	Jack	10551	“ He ’s been disgusted with her ever since she seduced me . ”
251151	251164	251148	251148	Mira	8319	“ Seduced you ? As if you were n’t part of it . ”
251165	251174	251175	251175	Jack	10551	“ Yes , I was part of it . ”
251179	251204	251175	251175	Jack	10551	“ But there are very few men who would turn down a naked woman in their bedroom , no matter what their marital status . ”
251205	251219	251220	251221	Paul Kresh	379	“ Oh , I do n’t know . It ’s not unheard of . ”
251272	251287	251269	251269	she	8319	“ If Hudson ’s so disgusted with Celia , why are they even friends ? ”
251333	251352	251319	251319	He	10551	“ Hudson blames himself for who she is now . He feels a sort of responsibility for her . ”
251360	251377	251353	251353	Mira	8319	“ I do n’t get it . Why would he be responsible for who she is ? ”
251445	251472	251432	251432	Jack	10551	“ It ’s a long complicated story . If you want to know more , you ’re going to have to ask Hudson . Or Celia . ”
251473	251481	251486	251486	Mira	8319	“ Yeah , that ’s not happening . ”
251532	251562	251525	251525	my	884	“ Okay , they ’re friends and he ’s supported her and he ’s never been into her and she knows that — so why is she after us ? ”
251566	251615	251563	251563	Jack	10551	“ Beats me . It ’s probably another one of her games . She ’s fond of them , you know . And she ’s good at them . I put nothing past her . She ’s a calculating , conniving woman , and she hates to lose . ”
251616	251619	251620	251620	I	884	“ Great . ”
251638	251652	251620	251620	I	884	“ How the hell are you supposed to get out of her grasp ? ”
251653	251661	251686	251686	she	8319	“ Let her think she ’s won . ”
251778	251796	251772	251772	she	8319	“ God , I ’m stuffed . And I have to go to the bathroom . Again . ”
251847	251864	251843	251843	I	884	“ Jack , I have a personal question for you , if you do n’t mind . ”
251865	251889	251890	251890	Hudson	1556	“ About six and a half inches . But it ’s not size that matters ; it ’s what you do with it . ”
251907	251912	251902	251902	I	884	“ I ’m serious . ”
251935	251940	251913	251913	He	1631	“ Okay . Shoot . ”
251941	251958	251913	251913	He	1631	“ Sophia once told me that Hudson was a sociopath . Do you believe that too ? ”
251987	251995	251996	251996	Jack	10551	“ Sophia ’s still claiming that bullshit ? ”
252010	252064	251996	251996	Jack	10551	“ One psychiatrist suggested it one time a handful of years ago . Hudson ’s never been clinically diagnosed as such , and no , I do n’t believe it . That boy cares . A lot . He just is n’t always able to express it . Blame that on Sophia too . ”
252140	252169	252133	252133	I	884	“ Why do you blame Sophia for his lack of expression ? I do n’t think you mean just her drinking . What did she do to him ? ”
252170	252193	252118	252118	his	10551	“ Well , if I ’m going to explain that then you ’re going to realize that I ’m to blame too . ”
252194	252200	252133	252133	I	884	“ I can handle that . ”
252201	252206	252207	252207	Jack	10551	“ But can I ? ”
252216	252291	252213	252213	he	10551	“ Sophia was n’t always hard like she is now . When I married her she was refined and serious , but she could be fun . But then I started building Pierce Industries . I did n’t have the money that Sophia came from . Her parents were convinced that she married beneath her . I wanted to prove them wrong , prove that I could be the man she should have married . ”
252292	252297	252299	252299	Hudson	1556	“ And you did . ”
252319	252363	252213	252213	he	10551	“ I did . And Sophia wanted that too . But she had n’t expected how lonely it could be , being married to a man who was married to his work . She decided I was cheating long before I ever did . ”
252374	252444	252364	252364	His	3598	“ Not being around — that was my mistake . Her loneliness drove her to drinking . Alcohol made her more closed off . So it became a cycle — I was n’t around because of work and when I was around , I did n’t want to be because my wife was a coldhearted bitch . I ’d throw myself more into work , just to avoid her . ”
252480	252513	252471	252471	Jack	10551	“ Eventually , she realized the one person I would come home for was Hudson . He was my son . My firstborn . I made time for him whenever I could . ”
252565	252638	252553	252553	Jack	10551	“ Sophia used my son to get to me . She dangled him in front of me to get my attention and pulled him from me just as quickly . Hudson was always a smart kid . He learned pretty early on that his mother used him as bait . Poor guy got caught in the middle of so many games . It ’s no wonder he became good at them himself . ”
252666	252674	252553	252553	Jack	10551	“ Was it the same with Mira ? ”
252675	252709	252715	252715	Jack	10551	“ No . Hudson had already become Sophia ’s rival by the time Mira came along . Sometimes I think he fought his mother just to keep his sister out of her focus . ”
252718	252730	252715	252715	Jack	10551	“ Now does that sound like the actions of a sociopath ? ”
252731	252754	252757	252757	I	884	“ No . It does n’t . But I already knew he was n’t . He has too much love in him . ”
252793	252804	252771	252771	he	10551	“ What the fuck are you doing here with her ? ”
252829	252846	252819	252819	Sophia	1858	“ Celia was n’t enough ? Now you have to steal this one from Hudson too ? ”
252879	252888	252866	252866	he	10551	“ Sophia . What are you doing here ? ”
252889	252896	252897	252897	She	8319	“ Spying on you , osbiviously . ”
252925	252930	252866	252866	he	10551	“ You ’re drunk . ”
252931	252938	252939	252939	Sophia	1858	“ That ’s illeverant . Irreverant . ”
252947	252953	252939	252939	Sophia	1858	“ That does n’t matter . ”
252954	252967	252866	252866	he	10551	“ How did you even know to come looking for me here ? ”
252971	253026	252968	252968	Sophia	1858	“ Mira . She told me she was having lunch with you . I decided to come to the lie . To see the lies . To hear your lies about me this time . Now the whole thing is a lie . You got your daughter covering for your cheating ass as well ? ”
253027	253030	253080	253080	she	8319	“ Mom ? ”
253055	253072	253043	253043	Sophia	1858	“ Mira ! Look who I found your father with now . Hudson ’s new girl . ”
253087	253117	253118	253118	She	1858	“ Mom , Dad ’s not with Alayna . He ’s with me . I told you I ’d be here . I was the one who invited Alayna . ”
253213	253219	253199	253199	Mira	8319	“ You invited this whore ? ”
253239	253256	253257	253257	Mira	8319	“ I did invite her . I did n’t invite you . Why are you here ? ”
253266	253292	253257	253257	Mira	8319	“ Never mind . Mom , you ’re drunk . We need to get you home . Did you take a cab to get here ? ”
253293	253296	253322	253322	she	8319	“ No . ”
253297	253304	253305	253305	Mira	8319	“ How did you get here ? ”
253336	253339	253340	253340	Sophia	1858	“ Frank ? ”
253352	253360	253340	253340	Sophia	1858	“ Yes , Frank ’s outside somewhere . ”
253361	253367	253368	253368	Jack	10551	“ I ’ll call him . ”
253383	253396	253376	253376	Mira	8319	“ I ’m going to walk you to the curb , okay ? ”
253400	253410	253411	253411	he	10551	“ No , Mira . Let me . Frank ? ”
253417	253435	253411	253411	he	10551	“ Sophia and I are ready to go home . Fine . We ’ll be out there . ”
253447	253455	253456	253456	Mira	8319	“ Did you drive yourself , Daddy ? ”
253470	253480	253456	253456	Mira	8319	“ Yeah , my car ’s with the valet . ”
253499	253517	253491	253491	Mira	8319	“ Mom , you ’re almost there . Hang on ‘ til you get to the car . ”
253527	253542	253522	253522	Mira	8319	“ I took a cab . I ’ll drive your car home for you . ”
253555	253561	253543	253543	He	10551	“ Thank you , babydoll . ”
253619	253625	253626	253626	She	8319	“ Do n’t mind me . ”
253640	253648	253626	253626	She	8319	“ I cry at everything these days . ”
253649	253661	253662	253662	I	884	“ I think this was a valid thing to cry over . ”
253705	253721	253730	253730	she	8319	“ Why ? I should be used to this by now , should n’t I ? ”
253806	253834	253800	253800	she	8319	“ I just keep thinking , this is going to be the grandma to my baby . Do I want my child to be exposed to this ? ”
253858	253894	253852	253852	I	884	“ I ca n’t imagine what that must be like . I do know how hard it is to have an alcoholic parent — how embarrassing it is . Has she ever been to rehab ? ”
253895	253898	253899	253899	She	8319	“ No . ”
253912	253921	253899	253899	She	8319	“ She wo n’t even talk about it . ”
253922	253961	253852	253852	I	884	“ Have you forced her to talk about it ? Like an intervention ? I ’m not saying they ’re fun , or easy , but they can work . I ’ve seen them work firsthand , actually . ”
253962	253967	253899	253899	She	8319	“ With your father ? ”
253968	253994	253852	253852	I	884	“ No . No one ever staged an intervention for him . I regret it often . I wonder if things would be different if … ”
254050	254065	254043	254043	I	884	“ Anyway . That ’s the past . But I was talking about me . ”
254084	254093	254043	254043	I	884	“ I had an intervention pulled on me . ”
254094	254102	254103	254103	My	884	“ What ? When ? For drinking ? ”
254113	254146	254043	254043	I	884	“ For obsessing over relationships , actually . I did n’t have many people in my life that cared for me at the time , but I ’d gotten arrested , and — ”
254147	254155	254108	254108	Mira	8319	“ Wait a minute — for obsessing ? ”
254165	254169	254156	254156	I	884	“ For stalking . ”
254180	254186	254170	254170	I	884	“ I know . Embarrassing . ”
254201	254292	254170	254170	I	884	“ Anyway , my brother and a couple of friends I had back then that have since all abandoned me because I was a total shit to each and every one of them , well , they sat me down and convinced me to seek help . Honestly , I only went because if I did n’t agree , it would have been jail time . But having them gathered like that — hearing that people cared what I did and what happened to me — it meant a lot . ”
254301	254309	254293	254293	Mira	8319	“ Alayna , I did n’t know . ”
254339	254355	254293	254293	Mira	8319	“ You ’ve hinted at a rocky past , but … I did n’t know . ”
254356	254367	254293	254293	Mira	8319	“ Of course you did n’t . Why would you ? ”
254368	254375	254293	254293	Mira	8319	“ I guess I would n’t . ”
254376	254462	254293	254293	Mira	8319	“ My point in telling you is that I ’ve learned through all my therapy that most addictions are really just a cry for love . And the crazy thing is that the more you ’re addicted to something , the harder it is to look up and see all the love there is around you . For the one outside , it can be tough to break through . But sometimes you can break through . As long as you ’re willing to try . ”
254515	254521	254522	254522	Mira	8319	“ Monday for your fitting ? ”
254528	254538	254522	254522	Mira	8319	“ Yep . I ’m looking forward to it . ”
254575	254583	254568	254568	I	884	“ Jordan , is there something wrong ? ”
254584	254611	254563	254564	my bodyguard	8335	“ Not exactly , Ms. Withers . But I wanted to warn you that Ms. Werner is outside . She ’s been here throughout your lunch . ”
254612	254615	254568	254568	I	884	“ Fuck . ”
254631	254637	254568	254568	I	884	“ What is she doing ? ”
254638	254657	254563	254564	my bodyguard	8335	“ Nothing . Sitting on a bench down the street is all . She even waved at me . ”
254658	254672	254673	254673	I	884	“ Yeah , she ’s a very friendly stalker , is n’t she ? ”
254681	254687	254673	254673	I	884	“ Did you tell Hudson ? ”
254688	254695	254673	254673	I	884	“ I texted him , yes . ”
254696	254704	254673	254673	I	884	“ Would you take me to him ? ”
254705	254709	254673	254673	I	884	“ Of course . ”
254866	254887	254855	254855	I	884	“ Hi , Trish . Could I possibly stick my head in to chat with Hudson for just a minute ? ”
254893	254912	254913	254913	She	1426	“ I ’m sorry , Ms. Withers , but Mr. Pierce is n’t back from his lunch date . ”
254942	254949	254913	254913	She	1426	“ Oh . Okay . Thanks . ”
255036	255048	255049	255049	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna . I did n’t expect to see you here . ”
255062	255068	255049	255049	Hudson	1556	“ I almost missed you . ”
255069	255084	255085	255085	He	3642	“ I ’m glad you did n’t . Come with me into my office . ”
255098	255101	255095	255095	he	3642	“ Norma — ”
255107	255113	255102	255102	She	3642	“ I ’ll email you . ”
255117	255123	255114	255114	Hudson	1556	“ Good . Thank you . ”
255190	255200	255181	255181	Hudson	1556	“ Why are you here ? Did something happen ? ”
255239	255249	255257	255258	my fortes	3647	“ I do n’t know — did something happen ? ”
255269	255275	255260	255260	Hudson	1556	“ What do you mean ? ”
255307	255318	255299	255299	I	884	“ Let me rephrase — was Norma your lunch date ? ”
255340	255349	255299	255299	I	884	“ More like lunch meeting , but yes . ”
255359	255367	255350	255350	I	884	“ Did you dine with her alone ? ”
255381	255409	255368	255368	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna , keep this up and I ’m going to have to put you over my knee . Except I know how much you like that . ”
255433	255447	255423	255423	His	3642	“ I do n’t like that you had lunch with her . Alone . ”
255458	255477	255448	255448	He	3642	“ Well , I do n’t like who you had lunch with either , so we ’re even . ”
255489	255521	255483	255483	he	3642	“ And no , that ’s not why I had lunch with her . It was business . We ’re working on a deal and we needed to hammer out details . ”
255584	255596	255551	255551	I	884	“ Did you have to do it in a social setting ? ”
255619	255651	255605	255605	Hudson	1556	“ I chose a lunch meeting with you in mind , Alayna . Would you rather that we ’d stayed in my office with the doors closed and no one around ? ”
255685	255693	255679	255679	I	884	“ You are not helping the situation . ”
255700	255731	255694	255694	Hudson	1556	“ You know that Norma is one of my key employees . My business frequently requires me to interact with her . In person . Sometimes , we ’re alone . ”
255760	255767	255747	255747	I	884	“ Maybe you could transfer her . ”
255768	255773	255821	255821	I	884	“ With what reason ? ”
255774	255782	255747	255747	I	884	“ The same reason you transferred David . ”
255804	255820	255796	255796	Hudson	1556	“ While I understand your comparison of the situations , I ’m not transferring Norma . ”
255829	255837	255838	255838	I	884	“ This is really unfair you know . ”
255844	255912	255838	255838	I	884	“ I ca n’t work with someone you do n’t trust but you can work with someone I do n’t trust ? And since you ’re the big business owner in this situation , you were able to just take care of things with David , transfer him , and if he refused , fire him . What can I do ? Nothing . I ’m helpless . ”
255924	255952	255913	255913	I	884	“ Norma has a big fat crush on you , Hudson . I can see in her eyes that she ’s not afraid to make a move . ”
255964	255977	255953	255953	Hudson	1556	“ She is quite aware that I do n’t return her feelings . ”
255978	255984	255988	255988	she	3653	“ How does she … ? ”
256007	256014	256002	256002	he	3652	“Has she already made a move ? ”
256015	256028	255988	255988	she	3653	“ Alayna , this conversation is going nowhere . I have appointments — ”
256029	256032	256002	256002	he	3652	“ Hudson ! ”
256049	256097	256038	256038	he	3652	“ She ’s told me that she wishes there were more between us . If that counts as making a move , then yes , she ’s made a move . But , as I ’ve said , I ’m not interested . And she knows it . ”
256115	256129	256098	256098	I	884	“ Can you explain how this is different than me working with David ? ”
256135	256149	256130	256130	He	3652	“ I ca n’t . You ’re right . It ’s not different . ”
256150	256164	256130	256130	He	3652	“ But that ’s all I get ? You wo n’t change it ? ”
256185	256200	256208	256208	he	3652	“ I ca n’t lose Norma . She ’s too valuable to my company . ”
256290	256298	256287	256287	he	3652	“ Do you want David to stay ? ”
256306	256316	256299	256299	My	884	“ Would you let him if I said yes ? ”
256321	256337	256317	256317	His	3652	“ If that ’s the only way to make this right , then I would . ”
256361	256366	256367	256367	I	884	“ Dammit , Hudson . ”
256385	256397	256398	256398	I	884	“ No . I do n’t want David to stay anymore . ”
256406	256424	256398	256398	I	884	“ It would n’t be good for him . He’s … he ’s in love with me . ”
256425	256429	256398	256398	I	884	“ I know . ”
256477	256494	256469	256469	I	884	“ Thank you for offering , though . I know that was n’t easy for you . ”
256495	256502	256503	256503	He	180	“ No . It was n’t . ”
256520	256532	256503	256503	He	180	“ But it would be worth it to make you happy . ”
256576	256594	256570	256571	Norma Anders	10443	“ Have you considered that maybe it ’s not good for Norma to work with you either ? ”
256598	256613	256595	256595	Hudson	1556	“ No , I have n’t . And I ’m sure it ’s not . ”
256620	256630	256614	256614	I	884	“ Could we make some sort of concession here ? ”
256645	256672	256631	256631	I	884	“ Like , could you not have meetings alone with her ? Is there anyone else on your team that could join you in the future ? ”
256689	256724	256678	256678	he	188	“ On the project we ’re currently working on — no . But it ’s almost done , and I do n’t expect that this level of secrecy would be necessary in the future . ”
256742	256750	256733	256733	they	3655	“ What project are you working on ? ”
256751	256759	256768	256768	he	188	“ Nothing you ’d be interested in . ”
256772	256808	256768	256768	he	188	“ I ’m trying to purchase a company from someone who would never sell if they knew I was the purchaser . Norma ’s the only person I can trust not to leak the information . ”
256809	256812	256813	256813	I	884	“ Fine . ”
256834	256837	256838	256838	I	884	“ Fine , ”
256848	256878	256838	256838	I	884	“ Social settings only , please . Where there are people around . And when this deal ’s over , you wo n’t need private meetings with her anymore ? ”
256879	256886	256838	256838	I	884	“ No . I wo n’t . ”
256887	256912	256838	256838	I	884	“ I ’m going to still ask about her . Like , all the time . Because I ca n’t just let it go . ”
256916	256920	256913	256913	He	188	“ I understand . ”
256944	256959	256960	256960	I	884	“ Do you know how much this hurts to let you keep her employed ? ”
256990	256997	256981	256981	Hudson	1556	“ Believe me , I do . ”
256998	257009	257010	257010	I	884	“ Okay then . As long as we ’re clear . ”
257015	257024	257025	257025	He	188	“ Was there another reason you stopped by ? ”
257033	257043	257025	257025	He	188	“ Or was Norma the intended subject all along ? ”
257055	257081	257044	257044	I	884	“ No . I came by because I just wanted to see you . Lunch was … interesting … and then Celia was there again . ”
257087	257092	257082	257082	His	188	“ Celia was there ? ”
257093	257100	257044	257044	I	884	“ Jordan said he texted you . ”
257120	257141	257113	257113	He	188	“ Damn . I left my phone on silent . I did n’t know . She did n’t try anything ? ”
257142	257153	257113	257113	He	188	“ Nope . Just let me know she was there . ”
257154	257162	257163	257163	He	188	“ Alayna . I ’m so sorry . ”
257200	257226	257192	257192	Hudson	1556	“ Maybe you should take some time off . I could send you out of town . Would you like another week at my spa ? ”
257241	257273	257238	257238	He	188	“ I ca n’t leave now . Not with everything at the club . And she ’ll know she scared me off . I ca n’t let her have that victory . ”
257274	257292	257293	257293	He	188	“ That ’s a very brave response . I just hate that you ’re in this position . ”
257314	257325	257305	257305	I	884	“ Do you have a plan to deal with her ? ”
257333	257341	257342	257342	he	188	“ I talked to my lawyer today , ”
257346	257368	257342	257342	he	188	“ As you said , there ’s nothing we can do legally . But we ’re looking into some other options . ”
257369	257373	257326	257326	He	188	“ Illegal options ? ”
257374	257394	257342	257342	he	188	“ How about you let me handle this ? I ’ll fill you in when everything ’s sorted out . ”
257439	257450	257434	257434	I	884	“ You require an awful lot of trust these days . ”
257460	257464	257451	257451	He	188	“ Too much ? ”
257487	257494	257484	257484	I	884	“ No . I trust you . ”
257516	257526	257509	257509	I	884	“ I know you ’ll take care of me . ”
257527	257530	257531	257531	His	188	“ Always . ”
257547	257563	257541	257541	He	188	“ I ’m sure that ’s Patricia letting me know my next appointment is here . ”
257576	257587	257564	257564	I	884	“ Guess my blowjob plans are shot to hell then . ”
257592	257600	257588	257588	His	188	“ Maybe I could make them wait . ”
257609	257640	257603	257603	I	884	“ Shut up . I did n’t have blowjob plans . For all that I ’m conceding to , I think I ’m the one who deserves the sexual favors . ”
257641	257644	257588	257588	His	188	“ Tonight . ”
257645	257654	257655	257655	I	884	“ I ’m holding you to it , H. ”
257668	257681	257655	257655	I	884	“ Meanwhile , you should know that I hate you a little . ”
257682	257691	257708	257710	his next client	3657	“ You do not . You love me . ”
257695	257699	257692	257692	I	884	“ Same thing . ”
257750	257763	257764	257764	Trish	9246	“ This was delivered for you while you were with Mr. Pierce . ”
257879	257885	257886	257886	I	884	“ Who gave you this ? ”
257903	257918	257886	257886	I	884	“ I do n’t know . A courier . I did n’t pay attention . ”
257919	257928	257944	257944	Reynold	380	“ Was she blonde , blue - eyes — ”
257934	257940	257929	257929	Trish	9246	“ It was a he . ”
258064	258082	258046	258046	I	884	“ Thank you , Trish . When Hudson is free , can you give this to him ? ”
258398	258408	258381	258381	her	3677	“ Would you like to share anything , Laynie ? ”
258545	258572	258542	258542	I	884	“ I ’ve had some extra stressors in my life recently , and I ’m here because I feel like it ’s causing me to backslide . ”
258584	258614	258573	258573	Lauren	166	“ Very concise identification of emotion , Laynie . Let ’s first talk about what kind of stressors you ’re dealing with . Is there anything you can eliminate ? ”
258615	258619	258620	258620	I	884	“ Not really . ”
258648	258662	258663	258663	Lauren	166	“ And that ’s perfectly fine . Sometimes you ca n’t eliminate stressors . ”
258679	258708	258663	258663	Lauren	166	“ Most times you have to deal with them . Or we choose to deal with them because the reward is greater than the impact of the stress . ”
258716	258723	258709	258709	Boy	192	“ Yes . That ’s it . ”
258724	258731	258709	258709	Boy	192	“ So what are these stressors ? ”
258732	258735	258709	258709	Boy	192	“ Um . ”
258756	258765	258745	258745	I	884	“ I recently moved in with my boyfriend . ”
258797	258805	258745	258745	I	884	“ You have a new living situation . ”
258818	258824	258745	258745	I	884	“ That ’s an adjustment . ”
258825	258839	258745	258745	I	884	“ Yes . And I just took a huge promotion at my job . ”
258848	258853	258854	258854	Lauren	166	“ Kudos to you , ”
258857	258864	258854	258854	Lauren	166	“ But yes , another stressor . ”
258865	258870	258875	258875	my	884	“ And my boyfriend ... ”
258896	258909	258875	258875	my	884	“ He has baggage that I ’m having some trouble dealing with . ”
258915	258921	258911	258911	Lauren	166	“ What kind of baggage ? ”
258922	258928	258929	258929	Celia	9246	“ Well , his ex — ”
258945	258987	258988	258988	I	884	“ She ’s decided for whatever reason that it ’s her mission to destroy our relationship . She ’s been terrorizing us . Me , really . First , she accused me of harassing her — which I did n’t do . ”
258997	259000	258988	258988	I	884	“ Honestly . ”
259001	259011	259012	259012	Lauren	166	“ Hey , no one ’s judging you here , ”
259051	259069	259036	259036	I	884	“ And now she ’s harassing me . Following me places . Leaving me notes and things . ”
259070	259075	259076	259078	the shopping addict	3687	“ Oh my god , ”
259081	259089	259076	259078	the shopping addict	3687	“ Have you been to the police ? ”
259108	259118	259099	259099	I	884	“ She has n’t done anything worthy of reporting . ”
259139	259150	259151	259151	Lauren	166	“ That kind of harassment would be stressful to anyone . ”
259163	259189	259151	259151	Lauren	166	“ But I ’m going to take a guess that it ’s been harder on you . Does it bring back emotions from your past ? ”
259190	259217	259218	259218	I	884	“ Of course it does . I used to do these same things to other people . It ’s awful . It makes me feel awful . ”
259264	259288	259255	259255	I	884	“ Also … I kind of feel like I deserve it now . Like it ’s my karma for the shit I pulled . ”
259298	259310	259289	259294	The red - haired sex addict	3689	“ You know that ’s not how life works , right ? ”
259311	259315	259319	259319	I	884	“ I guess . ”
259368	259422	259359	259359	I	884	“ Honestly , I know there are things that I need to work through in the area of self - worth . I ’m journaling . I ’m doing some meditation — yes , I need to do more . But really , those are n’t the emotions that I ’m concerned with . ”
259423	259426	259427	259427	Lauren	166	“ Okay , ”
259430	259480	259427	259427	Lauren	166	“ as long as you recognize that you have some work to do there , we can move on . So you have these stressors — some of them good — that ca n’t be eliminated . And you say they ’re causing you to backslide . How so ? ”
259490	259507	259481	259481	I	884	“ I ’m agitated . I ’m anxious . I ’m paranoid . I ’m accusatory . ”
259508	259517	259520	259522	the sex addict	3692	“ That sounds like me on my period . ”
259524	259534	259538	259540	the compulsive shopper	3692	“ Yeah , I call that being a woman . ”
259567	259586	259559	259559	I	884	“ You ’re saying these are normal emotions , and I need to just chill the fuck out . ”
259587	259590	259591	259592	sex addict	3692	“ Maybe , ”
259595	259599	259600	259600	Lauren	166	“ Not necessarily . ”
259607	259632	259600	259600	Lauren	166	“ They are normal emotions . But if they are impacting your daily life and relationships , then you need to deal with them . ”
259633	259647	259650	259650	I	884	“ They aren’t … yet . But only because I ’m fighting them . ”
259654	259694	259695	259695	I	884	“ The paranoia is the worst and it ’s unfounded . I ’m suspicious of a woman my boyfriend works with . And I have no reason to be . Fortunately , he likes it when I ’m jealous . ”
259709	259720	259721	259721	Lauren	166	“ Do you think you ’d like to try medication ? ”
259760	259775	259753	259753	I	884	“ No . No meds . I ’d rather handle this on my own . ”
259776	259784	259730	259730	she	166	“ Well , you know the drill . ”
259785	259794	259753	259753	I	884	“ Yes . I do . Substitute behaviors . ”
259823	259844	259815	259815	Lauren	166	“ And communication . Make sure you talk through all the feelings you ’re having , no matter how unreasonable . ”
259853	259861	259845	259845	I	884	“ That ’s why I ’m here . ”
259878	259916	259862	259862	She	166	“ Being here is a great step , Laynie . Do n’t get me wrong . But it ’s not just us you need to talk to . Make sure you ’re communicating with your boyfriend too . ”
259977	260046	259971	259971	Lauren	166	“ I know , it ’s scary . You ’re afraid other people ca n’t deal with your thoughts and your feelings . And I ca n’t promise that they can . But this is who you are . It ’s not going away . If you ca n’t share who you are with the people who love you , then maybe they do n’t really love you . ”
260300	260303	260304	260304	Gwen	816	“ So , ”
260307	260325	260326	260326	Gwen	816	“ right now the club is open from nine p.m. to four a.m. , Tuesday through Saturday ? ”
260349	260352	260353	260353	David	180	“ Right , ”
260356	260373	260391	260391	Gwen	816	“ But we ’re moving to expand the hours and be open seven days a week . ”
260394	260422	260391	260391	Gwen	816	“ That does n’t seem the best idea right now . Eventually perhaps . But right now you are n’t filled to capacity when you are open . ”
260462	260486	260458	260458	Gwen	816	“ Why would you extend your hours ? First step is to bring more people in , fill the club , then expand . ”
260493	260505	260487	260487	David	180	“ There ’s actually some good reasoning in that , Laynie . ”
260531	260541	260542	260542	Gwen	816	“ Expansion was your idea , was n’t it ? ”
260550	260557	260547	260547	She	816	“ I stand by my opinion . ”
260565	260585	260558	260558	She	816	“ Gwen , I have a feeling we ’re either going to be very close friends or bitter enemies . ”
260586	260612	260558	260558	She	816	“ Do you want this job , Gwen ? Because I ’d suggest the close friends angle and then you ’re a shoe - in . ”
260645	260653	260654	260654	Gwen	816	“ Oh , I do n’t know . ”
260660	260683	260654	260654	Gwen	816	“ Alayna ’s a smart woman . She strikes me as the type to know the value in keeping your enemies close . ”
260752	260759	260760	260760	I	884	“ Tell me something , Gwen . ”
260778	260790	260760	260760	I	884	“ Why do you want to leave Eighty - Eighth Floor ? ”
260811	260847	260800	260800	I	884	“ You seem to be an integral part of that club ’s success , and , not that I would n’t love to steal you away from them , but why would you let me ? ”
260848	260859	260860	260860	She	9246	“ Sometimes a woman just needs a change of scenery . ”
260876	260883	260885	260885	she	9246	“ I do n’t buy it . ”
260895	260898	260899	260899	She	9246	“ Touché . ”
260906	260966	260899	260899	She	9246	“ Personal reasons . Forgive me for not being more forthcoming , but it really does n’t have any bearing on why I should or should n’t be hired . My boss at Eighty - Eighth knows I want to leave . He ’ll give me a good reference . Other than that , I ’d rather not share . ”
261032	261050	261023	261023	she	816	“ It ’s not because of Hudson , is it ? That you want to work here . ”
261051	261155	261023	261023	she	816	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re asking . If you mean , do I want to work here because this club is the only one in town owned by the powerful business exec Hudson Pierce who also runs the hottest restaurant in town — Fierce — and the hottest club in Atlantic City — Adora — then the answer is yes . I want to work here because Hudson Pierce has the power needed to make this place live up to its potential . The Sky Launch is one of the few places that could rival what Eighty - Eighth is . ”
261212	261250	261207	261207	I	884	“ Then you ’re hired . Not because you ’re my friend or my enemy but because you ’re exactly who I need . I reserve the right to pass judgment on you personally in the future . ”
261255	261259	261251	261251	Gwen	816	“ Fair enough . ”
261275	261279	261280	261280	he	180	“ Welcome aboard , ”
261283	261317	261268	261268	Gwen	816	“ Sorry I wo n’t be here to watch you kick ass . Or kick Laynie ’s ass . Either way , I think you ’re going to knock her off her feet . ”
261318	261330	261331	261331	I	884	“ Hey , now . I can kick ass , too . ”
261356	261376	261268	261268	Gwen	816	“ What ’s that expression for ? You ca n’t doubt me . You do n’t even know me . ”
261377	261384	261385	261385	She	816	“ No , I do n’t . ”
261390	261418	261385	261385	She	816	“ But you have to be lacking something — or you think you ’re lacking something . Otherwise , you would n’t have come looking for me . ”
261426	261438	261439	261439	My	884	“ I just do n’t want to do it all alone . ”
261469	261485	261462	261462	Gwen	816	“ No need for explanations . All I need to know is when I start . ”
261486	261494	261495	261495	I	884	“ You ’ll accept the position then ? ”
261508	261521	261503	261503	Gwen	816	“ You accept that I might be a bitch to work with ? ”
261522	261533	261534	261534	We	3709	“ For some crazy reason , yes , I do . ”
261547	261554	261557	261557	her	816	“ Then I ’m all yours . ”
261563	261566	261557	261557	her	816	“ Fantastic . ”
261740	261746	261747	261747	His	3713	“ I ’m scared , H. ”
261753	261844	261845	261845	I	884	“ About lots of things . Little things . Mostly , I ’m worried about Celia — that I ’m not strong enough to not let her get to me . Especially because she ’s always been the girl that you should be with . In my head , she ’s the one I picture you with . Everyone does . She ’s perfect for you , from her manicured nails to her pedigreed upbringing . And , at the moment anyway , she does n’t have a police record . ”
261950	261995	261996	261996	He	3716	“ I believe in us , H. More than anything . But do you ? You used to tell me you were incapable of love . Do you still believe that ? Or do you love me as much as I believe you do ? ”
262308	262311	262312	262312	His	3720	“ Mmm . ”
262354	262364	262365	262365	He	3720	“ You did n’t wake me up last night . ”
262371	262377	262365	262365	He	3720	“ And I owed you . ”
262439	262449	262433	262433	His	3720	“ Or would you rather I let you sleep ? ”
262450	262457	262458	262458	I	884	“ No ! Do n’t stop . ”
262565	262571	262539	262539	My	884	“ Oh god , Hudson . ”
262664	262671	262672	262672	My	884	“ Fuck yeah , right there . ”
262706	262712	262713	262713	Hudson	1556	“ It ’s not enough , ”
262716	262727	262713	262713	Hudson	1556	“ I need you quivering and out of your mind . ”
262898	262903	262904	262904	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re welcome . ”
262923	262936	262918	262918	I	884	“ Where are you going ? I need to return the favor . ”
262958	262985	262986	262986	He	3720	“ That was n’t part of the deal . And besides , as incredible as that sounds , I have an early meeting to get to . ”
262996	263006	262986	262986	He	3720	“ What time did you get in last night ? ”
263007	263012	263013	263013	I	884	“ Three - ish , ”
263028	263043	263021	263021	Hudson	1556	“ Go back to sleep , then . I ’m sorry I woke you . ”
263044	263049	263013	263013	I	884	“ I ’m not . ”
263074	263077	263070	263070	I	884	“ nice view ”
263090	263097	263070	263070	I	884	“ You slept in your clothes . ”
263098	263109	263110	263110	I	884	“ But I somehow seem to be missing my panties . ”
263119	263133	263110	263110	I	884	“ And yeah , I was too tired last night to get undressed . ”
263137	263149	263134	263134	He	3720	“ You should have woken me . I would have helped . ”
263150	263166	263070	263070	I	884	“ Nah , you looked so peaceful . I did n’t want to disturb you . ”
263167	263194	263195	263195	His	3720	“ Trust me , it would n’t have been disturbing . It ’s disturbing now because I ca n’t have you the way I want you . ”
263204	263214	263195	263195	His	3720	“ I thought you were going back to sleep . ”
263215	263222	263228	263228	him	3720	“ I will . Nature called . ”
263331	263334	263322	263322	Hudson	1556	“ Hey . ”
263366	263371	263355	263355	He	3720	“ I missed you . ”
263378	263384	263372	263372	I	884	“ I missed you too . ”
263430	263433	263434	263434	Hudson	1556	“ Christ . ”
263443	263463	263434	263434	Hudson	1556	“ I want you , but I really do n’t have time to deal with you properly this morning . ”
263464	263475	263476	263476	I	884	“ I was n’t the one who woke me up . ”
263486	263493	263476	263476	I	884	“ Not that I ’m complaining . ”
263502	263509	263494	263494	Hudson	1556	“ Maybe I can be late . ”
263510	263524	263525	263525	I	884	“ No , no . You be on time like a good businessman . ”
263532	263549	263525	263525	I	884	“ How about I follow you around while you get ready and we can just talk ? ”
263550	263564	263565	263565	He	3726	“ I ’d like that . I ’ve missed talking to you too . ”
263581	263623	263565	263565	He	3726	“ Oh , I got your note you left with Celia ’s business card . My lawyer said we should save anything we find like that . As potential evidence . So if you get anything else , let me know . ”
263624	263633	263634	263634	I	884	“ Believe me , I ’ll tell you . ”
263657	263671	263634	263634	I	884	“ There ’s nothing he suggests we can do about it , though ? ”
263672	263678	263679	263679	His	3726	“ No . Not yet . ”
263688	263700	263679	263679	His	3726	“ Are you sure you do n’t want to leave town ? ”
263701	263706	263679	263679	His	3726	“ I ’m sure . ”
263767	263781	263759	263759	I	884	“ Though I bet Norma would n’t mind if I was n’t around . ”
263782	263786	263787	263787	He	3726	“ Norma again ? ”
263790	263797	263787	263787	He	3726	“ What ’s brought her up ? ”
263798	263805	263807	263807	he	3726	“ You ’re going to laugh . ”
263825	263854	263820	263820	I	884	“ You fell asleep with your phone and I checked to see if you had gotten my text . Then … oh god , do n’t hate me . ”
263855	263861	263862	263862	His	3726	“ What did you do ? ”
263872	263886	263867	263867	I	884	“ I checked your recent calls . I saw you talked to Norma . ”
263898	263907	263892	263892	I	884	“ Let me guess — that bothers you ? ”
263914	263929	263908	263908	His	3726	“ You called her at eight - something at night . From your bed . ”
263936	263940	263933	263933	he	3726	“ Come here . ”
263969	263975	263951	263951	He	3726	“ Alayna , come here . ”
263983	263996	263978	263978	I	884	“ I told you I was always going to ask about her . ”
263997	264003	264004	264004	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , you did . ”
264018	264052	264004	264004	Hudson	1556	“ It was business . I needed to get some figures together for the meeting this morning , and the ones she ’d sent me earlier in the day did n’t add up . ”
264053	264058	264059	264059	I	884	“ It was business , ”
264066	264074	264059	264059	I	884	“ Always business . Always the excuse . ”
264141	264149	264136	264136	his	3726	“ Why are you smiling at me ? ”
264150	264160	264161	264161	He	3726	“ Because I adore it when you ’re jealous . ”
264168	264173	264161	264161	He	3726	“ You know this . ”
264174	264192	264136	264136	his	3726	“ Shut up . I hate it . I ca n’t believe you like seeing me crazy . ”
264193	264201	264161	264161	He	3726	“ I like seeing that you care . ”
264221	264230	264233	264233	I	884	“ I love you . You know that . ”
264240	264246	264247	264247	He	3726	“ Yes , I know . ”
264254	264285	264247	264247	He	3726	“ Your jealousy shows me your words are true . It ’s nice . Keep being jealous . Or crazy , if that ’s what you want to call it . ”
264286	264292	264293	264293	I	884	“ You ’re so weird . ”
264303	264315	264293	264293	I	884	“ You ’re going to get shaving cream all over me . ”
264316	264322	264326	264326	he	3726	“ I do n’t care . ”
264414	264424	264407	264407	He	3726	“ I ca n’t have you this close anymore . ”
264443	264450	264452	264452	I	884	“ I ’m sorry I snooped . ”
264488	264501	264502	264502	He	3726	“ Do n’t be sorry . You know I have no secrets . ”
264505	264508	264509	264509	He	3726	“ Well . ”
264520	264531	264509	264509	He	3726	“ You know I do n’t care if you snoop . ”
264549	264557	264558	264558	I	884	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
264565	264577	264558	264558	I	884	“ Do you have secrets you are n’t telling me about ? ”
264587	264592	264582	264582	he	3726	“ Of course not . ”
264599	264616	264593	264593	He	3726	“ I simply meant that we can never know everything about each other . Can we ? ”
264617	264623	264584	264584	his	3726	“ But we can try . ”
264624	264631	264593	264593	He	3726	“ Yes . We can try . ”
264787	264792	264793	264793	He	3726	“ Speaking of Norma — ”
264802	264811	264793	264793	He	3726	“ How did your interview with Gwenyth go ? ”
264834	264885	264829	264829	I	884	“ I offered her the job , and she accepted . She ’s leaving Eighty - Eighth Floor without notice . They knew she was trying to leave , it seems , so she ’s working today as her last shift there and will be at The Sky Launch tonight . ”
264951	264954	264955	264955	Hudson	1556	“ Congratulations ! ”
264960	264969	264955	264955	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m glad you hit it off . ”
264985	265028	264970	264970	I	884	“ I would n’t say we hit it off , exactly . Challenged each other is more like it . But she ’ll be good for the club . Do you know why she wanted to leave Eighty - Eighth so quickly ? ”
265029	265034	265035	265035	He	3736	“ I do n’t . ”
265056	265062	265035	265035	He	3736	“ Did you ask her ? ”
265080	265098	265100	265100	she	816	“ She said it was personal . I thought you might know more . Because of Norma . ”
265107	265117	265118	265118	He	3736	“ If Norma knows , she did n’t share . ”
265128	265141	265118	265118	He	3736	“ Or if she shared , I was n’t paying any attention . ”
265148	265164	265142	265142	I	884	“ I like to hear that you do n’t always pay attention to Norma Anders . ”
265203	265217	265201	265201	he	3736	“ Stop looking at me like that or I ’ll definitely be late . ”
265292	265300	265286	265286	I	884	“ Get dressed . It will help . ”
265301	265305	265311	265311	he	3736	“ Good plan . ”
265434	265439	265419	265419	He	3736	“ You look good . ”
265454	265458	265440	265440	He	3736	“ Do I ? ”
265459	265464	265475	265475	I	884	“ Mm - hmm . ”
265478	265486	265475	265475	I	884	“ I ’m sure Norma will agree . ”
265550	265560	265545	265545	I	884	“ She will be there , wo n’t she ? ”
265568	265572	265563	265563	he	3736	“ She will . ”
265608	265645	265590	265590	He	3736	“ And whether she thinks I look good in this suit or not is none of my concern . I only care that you ’ll be the one to take me out of it later tonight . ”
265650	265653	265646	265646	My	884	“ Okay . "
265664	265675	265654	265654	He	3736	“ You ’ll be home to undress me this time ? ”
265679	265683	265676	265676	I	884	“ I promise . ”
265715	265718	265719	265719	He	3736	“ Good . ”
265731	265740	265719	265719	He	3736	“ I have to go . This meeting — ”
265741	265752	265719	265719	He	3736	“ I know , I know . You ’re late . ”
265756	265761	265753	265753	He	3736	“ Kiss me goodbye ? ”
265825	265837	265838	265838	I	884	“ That seemed a lot like a promise of some sort , ”
265841	265853	265838	265838	I	884	“ Whatever do you have up your sleeve , Mr. Pierce ? ”
265854	265868	265869	265869	He	3736	“ Now I ca n’t give away all my secrets , can I ? ”
265874	265889	265869	265869	He	3736	“ Going now . Get some rest . You ’re going to need it . ”
266256	266261	266262	266262	I	884	“ What the fuck ? ”
266277	266288	266262	266262	I	884	“ Hudson ! You scared the shit out of me ! ”
266289	266295	266296	266296	he	884	“ Where ’s your bodyguard ? ”
266300	266314	266296	266296	he	884	“ You on the sidewalk without him scared the shit out of me . ”
266318	266330	266315	266315	I	884	“ Terrifying me is n’t any way to prove a point . ”
266331	266336	266337	266337	He	884	“ It is n’t ? ”
266385	266394	266395	266395	I	884	“ What are you doing here , anyway ? ”
266400	266408	266409	266409	His	884	“ I ’m kidnapping you . Obviously . ”
266445	266457	266438	266438	Hudson	1556	“ Awesome . Are you taking me to dinner or something ? ”
266458	266462	266467	266467	he	884	“ Or something . ”
266473	266478	266479	266479	he	884	“ Let ’s go , ”
266507	266520	266490	266490	My	884	“ Wait ! I have n’t locked up the club or anything . ”
266546	266571	266523	266523	his	884	“ I was talking to Reynold when you left . He ’s taking care of securing the building . Why were you sneaking away ? ”
266614	266621	266604	266604	he	884	“ I was n’t sneaking away . ”
266628	266642	266625	266625	I	884	“ I was only running next door for coffee . No big deal . ”
266661	266672	266673	266673	I	884	“ All right , I wo n’t do it again . ”
266683	266693	266673	266673	I	884	“ So seriously , where are you taking me ? ”
266698	266708	266694	266694	He	884	“ I said I wanted you out of town . ”
266709	266712	266713	266713	I	884	“ What ? ”
266722	266749	266713	266713	I	884	“ I ca n’t leave town , H. I work tomorrow night . And I do n’t want to leave town . We talked about this . ”
266779	266785	266786	266786	He	884	“ Settle down , precious . ”
266802	266815	266786	266786	He	884	“ I simply thought a weekend away might be good for us . ”
266816	266821	266822	266822	I	884	“ Both of us ? ”
266851	266887	266888	266888	He	884	“ Yes , both of us . I ’d send you away if you ’d let me , but I ’m glad you wo n’t because I ca n’t bear to be away from you . ”
266904	266925	266888	266888	He	884	“ I arranged for David and Gwen to cover The Sky Launch tomorrow . We ’ll be back Sunday night . ”
266926	266944	266951	266951	my	884	“ I ’m the main manager now . I ca n’t just take off whenever I want . ”
266976	266987	266970	266970	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m the owner . Yes , you can . ”
266988	267001	267002	267002	I	884	“ I feel like I should be irritated at you about this . ”
267005	267026	267002	267002	I	884	“ But I ’m not . Thank you . I ’d love to be away with you for the weekend . ”
267027	267038	266970	266970	Hudson	1556	“ I think you need it . We need it . ”
267039	267070	267071	267071	I	884	“ You ’ve never been more right . And that ’s saying something since you ’re right an awful lot . But do n’t let it go to your head . ”
267105	267133	267135	267135	him	884	“ Where are we going ? Are we stopping at the penthouse so I can pack some clothes or did you take care of that , too ? ”
267141	267150	267151	267151	He	884	“ You ’ll see when we get there . ”
267170	267174	267175	267175	he	884	“ And precious , ”
267181	267192	267175	267175	he	884	“ you are n’t going to be needing any clothes . ”
267193	267203	267175	267175	he	884	“ Wake up , precious . We ’re here . ”
267243	267248	267249	267249	I	884	“ Where ’s here ? ”
267252	267259	267260	267260	He	884	“ Come on out and see . ”
267368	267372	267373	267373	I	884	“ The Poconos ? ”
267394	267400	267384	267384	I	884	“ It ’s absolutely gorgeous . ”
267430	267436	267409	267409	He	884	“ Seven p.m. on Sunday . ”
267437	267442	267409	267409	He	884	“ Yes , sir . ”
267498	267509	267492	267492	I	884	“ I do n’t need clothes , but you do ? ”
267513	267538	267510	267510	He	884	“ It ’s essentials . For both of us . I assure you , if you ’re naked , I will be as well . ”
267551	267562	267563	267563	he	884	“ This cabin ’s been in our family for years , ”
267570	267626	267563	267563	he	884	“ We have a hired manager that opens the place up once a week to keep it from getting musty . Other than that , Adam and Mira are the only ones who come up here on a regular basis . I thought it was time to get my own use out of the property . ”
267627	267638	267563	267563	he	884	“ As I said before , H , good thinking . ”
268135	268159	268127	268127	His	729	“ Ah , you ’re so wet . I want to lick your lips clean . But I want to be inside you . ”
268160	268163	268164	268164	I	884	“ Hudson . ”
268170	268177	268164	268164	I	884	“ I need . My hands . ”
268186	268196	268164	268164	I	884	“ Need to touch you . Need you naked . ”
268223	268226	268227	268227	he	729	“ Okay , ”
268264	268267	268261	268261	I	884	“ Whoops . ”
268405	268434	268394	268394	Hudson	1556	“ Fuck , you ’re so gorgeous like that . Your breasts standing up for me . Your legs begging for me to push my way between them . ”
268470	268478	268479	268479	he	729	“ Time for a change of scenery , ”
268488	268505	268482	268482	He	729	“ Mini tour . Kitchen ’s there . Bathroom . And here ’s the master bedroom . ”
268545	268569	268538	268538	he	729	“ Though I plan to mark you in every room of this house , we ’ll be spending most of our time here . ”
268641	268645	268646	268646	he	729	“ Turn around , ”
268666	268675	268676	268676	God	8844	“ Up . On your hands and knees . ”
268858	268861	268846	268846	he	729	“ Hudson . ”
268870	268877	268846	268846	he	729	“ Please . I need you . ”
268885	268897	268878	268878	He	729	“ I know , precious . I know what you need . ”
268916	268922	268906	268906	I	884	“ Need you . Inside . ”
268923	268936	268900	268900	he	729	“ Say it again and I ’ll make you wait even longer . ”
268937	268942	268943	268943	I	884	“ Please , Hudson . ”
268963	268972	268957	268957	He	729	“ I told you not to ask again . ”
269219	269230	269204	269204	He	729	“ Ah , Jesus , you ’re so goddammed tight . ”
269308	269319	269320	269320	he	729	“ I. Ca n’t . Get . Deep . Enough , ”
269329	269338	269320	269320	he	729	“ I need . To be . Deeper . ”
269417	269424	269403	269403	he	729	“ Come with me , precious . ”
269438	269454	269431	269431	He	729	“ I ’m going to go soon . Tell me you ’re coming with me . ”
269455	269458	269459	269459	I	884	“ Yes , ”
269462	269467	269459	269459	I	884	“ Yes . Yes . ”
269468	269471	269472	269472	He	729	“ Good . ”
269522	269527	269515	269515	My	884	“ Wait , Alayna . ”
269544	269551	269552	269552	His	729	“ Wait . Wait . Wait . ”
269561	269564	269552	269552	His	729	“ Wait . ”
269567	269570	269552	269552	His	729	“ Now ! ”
269612	269615	269616	269616	He	729	“ Fuuuccck ! ”
269652	269655	269656	269656	he	729	“ Well , ”
269663	269667	269656	269656	he	729	“ That was … ”
269688	269692	269675	269675	Hudson	1556	“ … amazeballs . ”
269866	269873	269860	269860	Hudson	1556	“ You have a nice voice . ”
269912	269921	269909	269909	I	884	“ This song makes me think of you . ”
269928	269940	269922	269922	His	729	“ You have a song that makes you think of me ? ”
269941	269948	269949	269949	We	3781	“ Several . A whole soundtrack . ”
269963	269972	269973	269973	He	729	“ Hmm . I did n’t know that . ”
270060	270066	270053	270053	he	729	“ How about a shower ? ”
270093	270098	270067	270067	I	884	“ Yes . Definitely . ”
270122	270137	270067	270067	I	884	“ Do you have any specific plans for the day ? Besides the shower . ”
270154	270173	270138	270138	I	884	“ You have me kidnapped in the mountains — I think I ’m kind of at your mercy . ”
270174	270200	270067	270067	I	884	“ That you are . In which case , I was thinking I ’d like to spend the day inside you as much as possible . ”
270204	270218	270201	270201	I	884	“ I ’m totally okay with that . Anything else you have planned ? ”
270219	270255	270138	270138	I	884	“ I ’d like to take you for a walk around the property . And perhaps some online jewelry shopping . I believe a new necklace or earrings for Mira ’s event might be nice . ”
270279	270311	270312	270312	I	884	“ That might not be bad . I do n’t have anything nice , and I have been through the wringer lately . Maybe I deserve a present of some sort . ”
270316	270319	270320	270320	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna ! ”
270323	270336	270320	270320	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ve never heard you care about any of that before . ”
270370	270382	270352	270352	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m very pleased . And a whole lot aroused . ”
270397	270410	270385	270385	he	3784	“ Why does my acting like a greedy bitch turn you on ? ”
270411	270441	270442	270442	He	3784	“ Because I love giving you things . It ’s something that I ’m good at . I wish I could give you more but you never seem interested . ”
270450	270475	270442	270442	He	3784	“ So anything you want , I ’ll give it to you . A shopping spree ? A week in Nevis ? A car ? ”
270489	270498	270476	270476	I	884	“ You ’re making fun of me now . ”
270509	270529	270499	270499	He	3784	“ I ’m dead serious . Do you want me to buy you a company ? Or an island ? ”
270530	270534	270476	270476	I	884	“ Stop it . ”
270535	270542	270543	270543	He	3784	“ No . I wo n’t . ”
270553	270591	270543	270543	He	3784	“ Anything you want , Alayna . It ’s yours . And since you do n’t seem to know that , I ’ll have to work even harder to make sure you take advantage of my wealth . ”
270601	270612	270594	270594	I	884	“ I do n’t want or need to take advantage — ”
270613	270617	270618	270618	He	3784	“ Now stop . ”
270627	270662	270618	270618	He	3784	“ I know you do n’t . You never have . But I ’ve told you before that you own me . Whether you take advantage of it or not , I ’m yours . ”
270673	270683	270670	270670	he	3784	“ And thereby , all I own is yours . ”
270694	270706	270684	270684	He	3784	“ There are contracts that can guarantee that , you know . ”
270751	270762	270746	270746	I	884	“ That ’s some pretty serious stuff you ’re implying . ”
270763	270775	270776	270776	His	3784	“ I ’ll do more than imply if you let me . ”
270847	270862	270863	270863	I	884	“ I think I ’ll just take a nice piece of jewelry for now , ”
270892	270898	270889	270889	he	3784	“ Then it ’s yours . ”
270909	270924	270906	270906	I	884	“ Also , some more books . And did you really say a car ? ”
270932	270947	270925	270925	He	3784	“ You do n’t want a car . You do n’t like to drive . ”
270974	270988	270989	270989	He	3784	“ No , I like to drive . You just never let me . ”
270994	271006	270989	270989	He	3784	“ You ’re not talking about cars anymore , are you ? ”
271007	271010	271011	271011	I	884	“ Nope . ”
271049	271057	271035	271035	He	3784	“ How about you drive right now ? ”
271071	271081	271058	271058	I	884	“ It kind of seems like I already am . ”
271256	271264	271248	271248	he	3796	“ I ’m glad I caught you . ”
271270	271286	271265	271265	He	3796	“ You caught me ? I was under the impression that I ’d caught you . ”
271294	271310	271287	271287	I	884	“ I mean right now . I ’m glad I caught you before you left . ”
271325	271336	271311	271311	He	3796	“ Why ? Do you need to talk to me ? ”
271337	271356	271311	271311	He	3796	“ I do n’t need to . My days are just better when they start off seeing you . ”
271382	271391	271364	271364	He	3796	“ I feel the same way . Completely . ”
271411	271439	271392	271392	I	884	“ Let ’s try to make sure we start it that way more often , okay ? And when we go to bed , the same thing . ”
271447	271458	271440	271440	He	3796	“ I did n’t want to wake you , precious . ”
271459	271526	271392	271392	I	884	“ We never want to wake each other . Let ’s get over that . I ’d rather lose sleep than lose what I have with you . And sometimes I feel like with our work and day - to - day lives , we slip away from each other . This weekend reminded me how good it feels to be the center of your world . ”
271532	271542	271527	271527	His	3796	“ You ’re always the center of my world . ”
271588	271606	271581	271581	I	884	“ Well , then wake me up and tell me that before you go from now on . ”
271607	271610	271611	271611	He	3796	“ Done . ”
271620	271645	271646	271646	He	3796	“ You ’re the center of my world , precious . Every minute of every day . Even when I ’m not with you . ”
271653	271664	271646	271646	He	3796	“ You make it so easy to fall so hard . ”
271693	271700	271688	271688	I	884	“ God , I love you . ”
271783	271790	271775	271775	He	3796	“ What is it , precious ? ”
271791	271797	271800	271800	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
271827	271841	271819	271819	I	884	“ Sometimes , when you go , I ’m left feeling off kilter . ”
271842	271853	271819	271819	I	884	“ Trust me , precious , the feeling is mutual . ”
271946	271949	271950	271950	she	8319	“ Turn , ”
272007	272010	272011	272011	She	8319	“ Hmm . ”
272018	272039	272011	272011	She	8319	“ I love this one , but it ’s not as good on you as I thought it would be . ”
272046	272056	272040	272040	I	884	“ Maybe I ’m not a very good model . ”
272109	272125	272104	272104	Mira	8319	“ That ’s the thing . You ’re too gorgeous and this dress dulls you . ”
272135	272142	272143	272143	she	8319	“ There ’s too much material , ”
272147	272158	272143	272143	she	8319	“ It ’s like I ’m trying to hide beauty . ”
272159	272162	272104	272104	Mira	8319	“ Whatever . ”
272163	272172	272173	272173	She	8319	“ There ’s got to be something else . ”
272194	272222	272173	272173	She	8319	“ All of these have the same problem . We need a perfect balance between the dress and you . We need one that shows more skin . ”
272223	272244	272247	272247	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t make it too skimpy or Hudson will kill you . Or me . Or both of us . ”
272286	272293	272279	272279	his	884	“ Hudson can bite my ass . ”
272330	272343	272318	272318	Mira	8319	“ Did you figure out if Hudson has any plans for Celia ? ”
272344	272353	272391	272391	Mira	8319	“ Unfortunately , I think he does n’t . ”
272376	272390	272369	272369	he	884	“ And did you see Celia was there at the restaurant last week ? ”
272396	272428	272391	272391	Mira	8319	“ Oh my god ! She was ? I did n’t see her . With Mom and everything , I guess I was distracted . Did she say anything to you ? ”
272429	272432	272433	272433	She	8319	“ Nope . ”
272458	272464	272465	272465	She	8319	“ Thank goodness for that . ”
272487	272523	272465	272465	She	8319	“ I ca n’t believe she has time to dedicate to that . I mean , she does n’t need the money , but she has a job . Does she just ignore her clients ? ”
272558	272575	272549	272549	I	884	“ I know , right ? Maybe she pays an assistant to do all her work . ”
272579	272589	272576	272576	Mira	8319	“ Or she canceled all her projects this month . ”
272590	272606	272607	272607	We	3807	“ And put up a sign in her office that says : Closed for Stalking . ”
272654	272665	272666	272666	Mira	8319	“ Well , at least we can find the humor . ”
272679	272700	272701	272701	She	8319	“ But there ’s no humor in this horrid dress . Let ’s get you out of this lousy thing . ”
272746	272754	272738	272738	Stacy	8674	“ Here ’s some for that one . ”
272889	272902	272883	272883	Mira	8319	“ We ’re scrapping this one . It ’s not quite right . ”
272908	272931	272883	272883	Mira	8319	“ You know what ? We should try the Furstenberg piece . The new one . What do you think , Stacy ? ”
272953	272988	272993	272993	Stacy	8674	“ It would look great with her skin tone . And the fit is meant to accentuate the bust line , which works with her body type . Is it still in the backroom ? ”
272989	272992	272932	272932	Stacy	8674	“ Yes . ”
272998	273003	273004	273004	Mira	8319	“ No , wait . ”
273008	273024	273025	273025	Her	8319	“ I pulled it for Misty to try on and then she chose something different . ”
273029	273041	273025	273025	Her	8319	“ Crap . I do n’t know where it is now . ”
273042	273048	273049	273049	Stacy	8674	“ I can look around , ”
273052	273083	273084	273084	Mira	8319	“ Let me go . I do n’t expect you to figure out where my hormone - influenced brain left it . Will you help her out of this one ? ”
273108	273111	273099	273099	Stacy	8674	“ Certainly . ”
273125	273132	273118	273118	Mira	8319	“ Thanks . Be back shortly ! ”
273140	273143	273118	273118	Mira	8319	“ Hopefully . ”
273227	273236	273222	273222	I	884	“ Are you excited for the renovation celebration ? ”
273237	273240	273243	273243	her	8319	“ Sure . ”
273257	273273	273243	273243	her	8319	“ I imagine it will bring new business . Will you be hiring more help ? ”
273274	273277	273222	273222	I	884	“ Probably . ”
273298	273301	273222	273222	I	884	“ Lift . ”
273418	273425	273426	273426	She	8674	“ Are you mad at me ? ”
273435	273447	273426	273426	She	8674	“ Mad that I did n’t want to see your video ? ”
273448	273454	273455	273455	she	8674	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , ”
273464	273473	273455	273455	she	8674	“ That ’s not why I ’m mad . ”
273474	273480	273481	273481	I	884	“ But you are mad ? ”
273494	273497	273485	273485	My	884	“ Why ? ”
273498	273501	273502	273502	She	8674	“ Seriously ? ”
273510	273543	273502	273502	She	8674	“ I offered that video as a gesture of kindness . One woman to another — we’re supposed to look out for each other . At least we are in my book . ”
273549	273555	273544	273544	I	884	“ I have no idea — ”
273561	273593	273556	273556	She	8674	“ I told you Hudson did n’t know that I had it . And then you went ahead and told him about it anyway . That was just … just low . ”
273598	273607	273556	273556	She	8674	“ Wait , wait . I ’m confused . ”
273608	273633	273634	273634	She	8674	“ What exactly is confusing about it ? I went out of my way to help you and you pretty much betrayed my confidence . ”
273647	273677	273634	273634	She	8674	“ I do n’t know what I expected . He ’s Hudson Pierce , after all . He gets everybody ’s panties in a wad with just a glance . ”
273685	273702	273634	273634	She	8674	“ Hey , he did n’t trick you into telling him about it , did he ? ”
273703	273714	273755	273755	God	8844	“ No . No , he did n’t trick me . ”
273736	273744	273729	273729	I	884	“ Look , I ’m sorry that — ”
273745	273750	273751	273751	She	8674	“ Do n’t bother . ”
273761	273764	273765	273765	I	884	“ Please ! ”
273786	273792	273793	273793	I	884	“ Please let me finish . ”
273811	273814	273805	273805	she	8674	“ Fine . ”
273815	273830	273805	273805	she	8674	“ I ’m sorry I told Hudson , and that it betrayed your confidence . ”
273865	273933	273805	273805	she	8674	“ I was n’t trying to … hurt you … or piss you off in any way . I was just trying to be honest with my boyfriend . And I did n’t tell him what it was , obviously , because I did n’t know . I asked if he knew what you might have and he said he had no idea . End of discussion . ”
273951	273958	273934	273934	She	8674	“ Wait , one more thing — ”
273964	273974	273934	273934	She	8674	“ How do you know that I told him ? ”
273994	273999	274000	274000	she	8674	“ He ’s emailed , ”
274006	274015	274000	274000	she	8674	“ And called me , asking about it . ”
274016	274020	274021	274021	Hudson	1556	“ Emailed … ? ”
274029	274041	274000	274000	she	8674	“ And called . Every day last week , in fact . ”
274061	274074	274050	274050	I	884	“ But why would he do that ? What did he say ? ”
274075	274135	274000	274000	she	8674	“ His email said he learned that I had a video with him in it , and he wanted to talk to me about it . He mentioned a bunch of legal things about privacy and libel and all that crap . Then he asked if I ’d send it to him . His phone messages said the same . ”
274136	274142	274050	274050	I	884	“ What did you say ? ”
274143	274196	274000	274000	she	8674	“ I did n’t actually talk to him . He kept calling , though , so I finally sent it Thursday . There was really no point keeping it from him . He knows I saw what ’s on the video , even if he did n’t know about the video itself . ”
274229	274259	274260	274260	Her	3814	“ Then he emailed me today and asked me if we could talk about what he ’d need to do in order to ensure the video was gone forever . ”
274267	274274	274260	274260	Her	3814	“ Like I could be bribed . ”
274275	274281	274282	274282	My	884	“ I do n’t understand . ”
274297	274324	274282	274282	My	884	“ He said there was nothing you could possibly have that would interest me . He was n’t concerned about it . Why would he … ? ”
274325	274335	274282	274282	My	884	“ Because he ’s lying to you , Alayna ! ”
274347	274410	274282	274282	My	884	“ That ’s exactly my point about him . You ca n’t trust him or anything he says . He ’ll string you along , make you think he ’s interested , make you think he ’s available . But he ’s not . I do n’t know what the hell game he ’s playing , but he ’s good at it . ”
274558	274567	274574	274574	She	8674	“ What ’s on the video , Stacy ? ”
274568	274573	274574	274574	She	8674	“ Uh - uh . ”
274589	274605	274574	274574	She	8674	“ I ’m not playing this game . You did n’t want to see it . ”
274624	274657	274620	274620	I	884	“ I was wrong . I should n’t have … I do n’t know … dismissed it so easily . You have to understand — I was trying to trust him because … ”
274703	274736	274696	274696	I	884	“ Look , you wanted me to see it to warn me about him . Do n’t you think I need the warning even more now ? Woman to woman . Please . ”
274769	274794	274764	274764	Stacy	8674	“ I ’m off at four . Give me your email and I ’ll send it to you as soon as I get home . ”
274795	274802	274803	274803	I	884	“ Thank you . Thank you . ”
274818	274851	274764	274764	Stacy	8674	“ But I ’m done . I ’m destroying the damn thing like he asked and then no more . Whatever you decide about the man , you ’re on your own . ”
274852	274856	274857	274857	I	884	“ Of course . ”
274871	274885	274857	274857	I	884	“ Here ’s my card . The email is my home and work . ”
274899	274922	274886	274886	She	8674	“ Thank you , Stacy . And , again , I ’m sorry . If I can make it up to you … ”
274923	274927	274942	274942	she	8674	“ Found it ! ”
275012	275018	275005	275005	Mira	8319	“ This is the one , ”
275650	275657	275658	275658	he	655	“ Remember to set the alarm , ”
277015	277020	276997	276997	I	884	“ Here you are . ”
277116	277125	277111	277111	they	3855	“ I did n’t realize you were home . ”
277148	277152	277154	277154	my	884	“ I am . ”
277165	277175	277154	277154	my	884	“ You do n’t come out here very often . ”
277179	277184	277185	277185	I	884	“ It scares me . ”
277215	277222	277208	277208	he	2430	“ You ’re afraid of heights ? ”
277223	277234	277235	277235	I	884	“ Not really . It ’s falling that scares me . ”
277258	277331	277235	277235	I	884	“ It ’s actually thrilling to be out here . Being so high up , feeling so untouchable , the wind rushing at you from below . I can see why so many people are intrigued by the idea of flying . Problem is , no matter how good the flight , you always have to come back down eventually . And lots of times , that return is a free fall . ”
277332	277339	277340	277340	His	2430	“ You ’re waxing poetic tonight . ”
277348	277352	277353	277353	I	884	“ Am I ? ”
277365	277370	277353	277353	I	884	“ I suppose so . ”
277500	277506	277490	277490	He	2430	“ Have you been drinking ? ”
277513	277519	277507	277507	I	884	“ Is that a problem ? ”
277520	277543	277490	277490	He	2430	“ Of course not . You just do n’t usually drink . You ’re full of all sorts of surprises this evening . ”
277544	277557	277507	277507	I	884	“ Ah . Surprises . It ’s certainly a day for that . ”
277558	277564	277490	277490	He	2430	“ Have there been others ? ”
277565	277569	277570	277570	I	884	“ There have . ”
277652	277667	277624	277624	I	884	“ Hudson , why do n’t you ever tell me that you love me ? ”
277668	277675	277676	277676	He	2430	“ Where did that come from ? ”
277728	277735	277712	277712	I	884	“ It ’s a valid question . ”
277736	277756	277769	277769	he	2430	“ Is it ? My methods of emotional expression have n’t seemed to bother you before — why now ? ”
277757	277763	277764	277764	I	884	“ Has n’t bothered me ? ”
277781	277856	277769	277769	he	2430	“ It ’s always bothered me . I ’ve been patient , that ’s all . Letting you settle into our relationship . I realize it ’s all new for you — you’ve never let me forget it . But it ’s new for me too . I ’ve bared all my heart to you . And you ca n’t give me this one thing — three things , actually . Three little words . ”
277857	277866	277867	277867	He	2430	“ You know how I feel about you . ”
277889	277898	277882	277882	my	884	“ But why ca n’t you say it ? ”
277899	277906	277907	277907	He	2430	“ Why do I need to ? ”
277913	277923	277907	277907	He	2430	“ If you understand , there ’s no point . ”
277924	277932	277907	277907	He	2430	“ Sometimes it helps to hear it . ”
277933	277937	277907	277907	He	2430	“ Helps what ? ”
277958	277970	277953	277953	I	884	“ Helps everything ! Helps deal with insecurity . With doubts . ”
277983	278019	277971	277971	He	2430	“ What are you doubting ? Us ? What we have ? I asked you to live with me . I changed my entire life to be with you . What is there to doubt ? ”
278020	278027	277953	277953	I	884	“ Your reasons . Your motives . ”
278028	278077	277971	277971	He	2430	“ My reasons for wanting you with me are I want you with me . What more do you need to know ? You want words ? They can be changed and manipulated and misconstrued . But my actions — they speak everything that you need to know . ”
278177	278200	278167	278167	I	884	“ If I ’m going by your actions , then right now what I know is that I ’ve been lied to . ”
278221	278228	278201	278201	He	3859	“ What are you talking about ? ”
278239	278251	278229	278229	I	884	“ I saw it , Hudson . I saw the video . ”
278252	278256	278201	278201	He	3859	“ What vid — ”
278267	278299	278257	278257	I	884	“ Do n’t even fucking pretend you do n’t know what video I ’m referring to , because after everything we ’ve been through , I do n’t deserve the runaround . ”
278326	278337	278338	278338	He	3859	“ Okay . I wo n’t run you around then . ”
278349	278358	278338	278338	He	3859	“ Where did you get it ? Stacy ? ”
278365	278370	278361	278361	I	884	“ Does it matter ? ”
278371	278376	278377	278377	His	3859	“ I suppose not . ”
278414	278420	278377	278377	His	3859	“ You were kissing Celia . ”
278421	278425	278382	278382	My	884	“ I saw . ”
278426	278433	278377	278377	His	3859	“ Do you want to explain ? ”
278434	278439	278440	278440	He	3859	“ Does it matter ? ”
278449	278452	278453	278453	My	884	“ Yes ! ”
278481	278512	278470	278470	He	3859	“ It was before I met you , Alayna . I have n’t asked you to explain your actions before we met . I should n’t be expected to either . ”
278543	278549	278550	278550	I	884	“ But this is different , ”
278554	278574	278550	278550	I	884	“ Because you ’ve already offered an explanation . You said there was never anything between you and Celia . ”
278575	278580	278532	278532	he	3859	“ There was n’t . ”
278581	278594	278550	278550	I	884	“ I ’m supposed to believe that after seeing what I saw ? ”
278595	278601	278602	278602	His	3859	“ Looks can be deceiving . ”
278626	278633	278624	278624	me	884	“ That ’s all you got ? ”
278634	278662	278602	278602	His	3859	“ You ’ve told me there ’s nothing between you and David , yet there ’s been many a time that it has looked like there was . ”
278663	278698	278624	278624	me	884	“ It only looked that way because you were paranoid and jealous . You never saw me lip - locked with him . Believe me , seeing it is worse than you can imagine . ”
278714	278733	278699	278699	He	3859	“ I ’m sure if I went and looked at old security tapes I might see exactly that . ”
278803	278821	278988	278988	He	3863	“ Yes . Once upon a time I was with David . I ’ve told you that . ”
278822	278834	278849	278849	He	3859	“ After you let it slip and I figured it out . ”
278835	278848	278849	278849	He	3859	“ Jesus ! Will I always have to pay for that mistake ? ”
278862	278931	278855	278855	I	884	“ Okay , I was n’t forthcoming . I kept things from you . But only because I did n’t want to hurt you , and I admitted it when you confronted me . But this — you outright lied about this , Hudson . You told me there was nothing to see on Stacy ’s video . You told me I did n’t need to go looking . ”
278932	278939	278849	278849	He	3859	“ And you went looking anyway . ”
278940	278987	278855	278855	I	884	“ No . I did n’t . I stayed away . Until I found out that you were deliberately trying to hide it from me — yes , Stacy told me you ’d asked her for it . Was I supposed to keep trusting you then ? ”
278993	279016	278988	278988	He	3863	“ I did n’t know what she had . I asked because I was curious . I was n’t deliberately hiding anything . ”
279017	279066	279067	279067	My	884	“ You were deliberately hiding a whole fucking relationship with someone who you swore was never anything but a friend ! And even now that I ’ve figured out you and Celia were together , even now that I have proof , you still ca n’t admit it . ”
279090	279097	279098	279098	he	3863	“ I ’m not admitting anything , ”
279101	279111	279098	279098	he	3863	“ You have n’t figured out anything , Alayna . ”
279112	279138	279098	279098	he	3863	“ Then clear things up for me . Tell me what I ca n’t seem to understand . What ’s going on in that video ? ”
279139	279142	279143	279143	he	3863	“ Nothing , ”
279147	279153	279143	279143	he	3863	“ Nothing ’s going on . ”
279154	279157	279158	279158	My	884	“ Hudson ! ”
279173	279208	279169	279169	I	884	“ You ’re kissing her . Kissing her deeply . Passionately . Oh yes , I watched it several times , I could reenact the whole thing for you by now if you wanted . ”
279226	279256	279220	279220	I	884	“ Not to mention that you were supposed to be meeting Stacy right then . And it did n’t escape me on what night this whole thing took place . ”
279262	279279	279257	279257	He	3863	“ Meeting Stacy ? Is that what she told you ? What else did she say ? ”
279289	279301	279288	279288	I.	884	“ That really does n’t have any bearing on this conversation . ”
279302	279317	279318	279318	He	3863	“ Well , as far as I ’m concerned , this conversation is over . ”
279334	279350	279324	279324	I	884	“ It is not . I have questions and you ’ve given me zero answers . ”
279351	279365	279366	279366	His	3863	“ I have no answers to give you . This subject is closed . ”
279380	279395	279366	279366	His	3863	“ Are you kidding me ? You ’re not going to talk about this ? ”
279396	279403	279404	279404	He	3863	“ No , I ’m not . ”
279420	279429	279430	279430	I	884	“ Hudson , this is so not fair . ”
279448	279511	279430	279430	I	884	“ We ’ve said we needed to be honest with each other — that we needed to form a relationship built on trust . We agreed to be open . But you ’re hiding something with this . You lied ! And not talking about it ? How are we supposed to move forward when you ’re keeping such a big secret ? ”
279527	279539	279512	279512	He	3863	“ Have I done anything to betray your trust before this ? ”
279550	279560	279540	279540	I	884	“ You went behind my back to transfer David … ”
279568	279574	279561	279561	He	3863	“ That was for us . ”
279586	279630	279579	279579	he	3863	“ Have I done anything that makes you think I do n’t have our relationship ’s best interests in mind ? Have I done anything to make you believe that I do n’t want to be with you ? That I do n’t … ”
279640	279654	279579	279579	he	3863	“ That I do n’t care … for you with everything I have ? ”
279677	279705	279664	279664	He	3863	“ Everything I ’ve done since we ’ve been together has been for you and me . Trust me when I tell you this is n’t important . ”
279719	279726	279711	279711	he	3863	“ This does n’t affect us . ”
279727	279753	279664	279664	He	3863	“ How can it not affect us ? This was the night of the Stern Symposium . The night you said you first saw me . ”
279754	279766	279767	279767	His	3863	“ Yes , it was the night I first saw you . ”
279779	279795	279774	279774	he	3863	“ But this was before that . Separate . You need to forget about this . ”
279922	279932	279919	279919	I	884	“ What if I ca n’t let it go ? ”
279939	279949	279950	279950	He	3863	“ Then it means you do n’t trust me . ”
279959	279976	279950	279950	He	3863	“ And I do n’t know how we can continue on with our relationship without trust . ”
279993	280012	279981	279981	I	884	“ Are you saying that I have to choose ? Trust you about this or we ’re over ? ”
280013	280018	280019	280019	His	3863	“ Of course not . ”
280027	280054	280019	280019	His	3863	“ But I have nothing else that I can say . Whether you can live with that or not is the choice you have to make . ”
280135	280165	280130	280130	I	884	“ That ’s a trap , Hudson . How could anyone live with that ? How can we ever move forward when everywhere I turn there ’s a wall ? ”
280166	280172	280173	280173	His	3863	“ There are no walls . ”
280181	280194	280173	280173	His	3863	“ I ’m here with you . I share everything with you . ”
280195	280200	280130	280130	I	884	“ Except your past . ”
280201	280210	280173	280173	His	3863	“ Except this one thing in my past . ”
280211	280218	280219	280219	My	884	“ No . There ’s more . ”
280225	280292	280219	280219	My	884	“ It ’s not just the video , Hudson . It ’s your secrets , the things you ca n’t say . You ca n’t tell me what that night was about . You ca n’t tell me how you feel about me . You ca n’t tell me what the true nature of your relationship is with Celia , with Norma — even with Sophia ! ”
280293	280313	280314	280314	he	3869	“ Jesus Christ , Alayna . I ’ve told you exactly the true nature of my relationships and you — ”
280324	280333	280314	280314	he	3869	“ refuse to believe what I ’ve said . ”
280334	280347	280348	280348	I	884	“ Because there ’s proof over and over again that says otherwise . ”
280361	280383	280348	280348	I	884	“ And if I ’m missing the whole picture , than maybe you should stop leaving all the vital parts out . ”
280399	280414	280391	280391	he	3869	“ Nothing of what I ’ve kept from you is vital to our relationship . ”
280422	280431	280391	280391	he	3869	“ It has nothing to do with us . ”
280440	280452	280432	280432	I	884	“ It does ! It has everything to do with us . ”
280530	280565	280523	280523	I	884	“ Do n’t you see , Hudson ? I want to know everything about you . I want to be everything with you . How can I when you do n’t let me in ? ”
280566	280596	280597	280597	He	3869	“ I ’ve let you in further than any other human being I ’ve known . You know things about me that I never planned to share with anyone . ”
280606	280614	280597	280597	He	3869	“ Does n’t that count for something ? ”
280615	280619	280620	280620	I	884	“ It does . ”
280639	280649	280628	280628	he	3869	“ It counts for so much . But see , ”
280658	280783	280784	280784	I	884	“ that ’s where we ’re stuck . Because you ’re asking me to give up so much of who I am in order for you to keep your secrets , and that will tear me apart . I ca n’t do it . I ca n’t function . I obsess , Hudson . I ’ve never kept that from you . Now , I ’ve had a history of obsessing over things that were n’t valid , but this time , it ’s not in my head . There are real things you ’re hiding and can you not see how I ’m going crazy over it ? Everything you fixed about me is unraveling and I do n’t know what to do . ”
280790	280800	280784	280784	I	884	“ And I ’m not even sure you care . ”
280801	280807	280808	280808	He	884	“ I care , Alayna . ”
280827	280847	280818	280818	I	884	“ I care more than I can stand it , and I will do anything to make this better . ”
280952	280962	280963	280963	I	884	“ Then tell me what I need to know , ”
280976	280983	280966	280966	He	884	“ No . I wo n’t . ”
281003	281026	280998	280998	I	884	“ Were you together ? Did you fuck her ? Did you fuck her that night ? The night you met me ? ”
281032	281068	281027	281027	He	884	“ No . No . No . And no . I ’ve told you this before and if those words are n’t enough , why should I believe that any others would be any different ? ”
281069	281101	281027	281027	He	884	“ Because those words are n’t the words I need . I do n’t need denials . I need truths . What happened , Hudson ? What is she to you ? ”
281102	281109	281027	281027	He	884	“ Alayna , leave it alone . ”
281110	281115	281027	281027	He	884	“ I ca n’t ! ”
281127	281134	281124	281124	he	884	“ Then I need to leave . ”
281135	281143	281144	281144	I	884	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
281147	281154	281144	281144	I	884	“ Like leave to cool down ? ”
281160	281172	281155	281155	He	884	“ It means that we need to take some time apart . ”
281173	281178	281179	281179	I	884	“ What ? No ! ”
281271	281278	281279	281279	he	884	“ It ’s for the best , ”
281354	281377	281418	281418	His	884	“ You tell me you care about me more than you can stand and now you want to break up with me ? ”
281390	281417	281378	281378	He	884	“ No , not break up , precious . Just take some time apart . Time to figure out how we want to deal with this . ”
281437	281449	281426	281426	they	3874	“ You mean time for me to get my shit together . ”
281450	281457	281418	281418	His	884	“ Both of us , Alayna . ”
281472	281493	281458	281458	I	884	“ I do n’t know where you get your definitions , but that sure sounds like breaking up to me . ”
281494	281505	281458	281458	I	884	“ If that ’s what you want to call it . ”
281506	281524	281458	281458	I	884	“ I do n’t want to call it anything . I do n’t want it to happen ! ”
281525	281533	281534	281534	He	884	“ I hope it will be temporary . ”
281583	281586	281573	281573	He	884	“ Hudson ! ”
281598	281608	281609	281609	I	884	“ Do n’t go . Please do n’t go . ”
281627	281642	281643	281643	His	884	“ I ’m doing this for you , Alayna . For both of us . ”
281660	281725	281649	281649	he	884	“ I ca n’t bear that I ’m hurting you , and it will destroy me if I lose you . But there are some things that I can never tell you . And now we ’re at an impasse , as you said . Because you say you ca n’t go on not knowing and I ca n’t go on without your trust . ”
281726	281757	281758	281758	I	884	“ I do trust you . I ’ll learn to live with this if I have to . I ’ll figure it out . I just ca n’t lose you ! ”
281781	281798	281774	281774	he	884	“ You ’re not losing me . We ’re simply stepping away . Maybe I can … ”
281813	281820	281799	281799	He	884	“ Maybe you can … what ? ”
281828	281838	281822	281822	he	884	“ I do n’t know . I need time . ”
281853	281865	281822	281822	he	884	“ But where are you going ? This is your home . ”
281866	281880	281822	281822	he	884	“ It ’s your home too . I ’ll stay at the loft . ”
281892	281904	281822	281822	he	884	“ Hudson ! Do n’t do this . Do n’t leave . ”
281922	281939	281905	281905	He	884	“ This is n’t forever , precious . But I ca n’t watch you like this . ”
281940	281948	281950	281950	I	884	“ Like , what ? Like crazy ? ”
281993	282086	281986	281986	I	884	“ Yeah , I ’m crazy . This is who I really am , Hudson . You see it now . Here I am , exposed . It always scares people away , but I never thought it would scare you . Yet here you are running . No wonder you think I ca n’t handle your secrets . Because you probably think I ’d react just like you are now . But I ’m not a coward , Hudson . I can take it . I wo n’t run from you . ”
282091	282106	282087	282087	His	3877	“ I ’m not running from you , Alayna . I ’m saving you . ”
282107	282111	282181	282181	he	3877	“ From what ? ”
282112	282116	282117	282117	We	3878	“ From me ! ”
282136	282148	282130	282130	he	3877	“ I ’ll talk to you later . Tomorrow , maybe . ”
282149	282152	282181	282181	he	3877	“ Hudson ! ”
282153	282162	282130	282130	he	3877	“ I … I ca n’t , Alayna . ”
283342	283351	283338	283338	I	884	“ Hey , you ’re a runner right ? ”
283352	283356	283338	283338	I	884	“ Ms. Withers ? ”
283357	283374	283338	283338	I	884	“ You were Special Ops . You had to stay in shape for that , right ? ”
283404	283416	283399	283399	Hudson	1556	“ And I imagine that makes you a fairly good runner . ”
283417	283424	283338	283338	I	884	“ Yes , I suppose so . ”
283425	283453	283399	283399	Hudson	1556	“ Good . I want to go for a run and Hudson wo n’t let me go without a bodyguard . I ’ll be ready in fifteen . ”
283462	283471	283454	283454	He	655	“ Be there in ten , Ms. Withers . ”
283472	283476	283338	283338	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
283497	283562	283338	283338	I	884	“ And , oh my god , Jordan , please call me Laynie . Please , please , please . I know you ’re not supposed to , but I do n’t care about Hudson ’s stupid rules . I ’m having a bad day and I could use a friend . Even if you are n’t really my friend , pretend . Please . ”
283563	283581	283587	283587	he	3900	“ You should know me well enough to know that I ’m not much good at pretending . ”
283597	283617	283587	283587	he	3900	“ But I am an excellent runner . Be ready to have your ass handed to you . Laynie . ”
283935	283943	283944	283944	Jordan	655	“ My shift ’s over , Laynie , ”
283955	283964	283944	283944	Jordan	655	“ Reynold ’s waiting for you up there . ”
283998	284002	284003	284003	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
284010	284019	284003	284003	I	884	“ I needed you and you were there . ”
284026	284045	284020	284020	Jordan	655	“ It ’s not my place , but you should know — Mr. Pierce is a complicated man . ”
284046	284054	284055	284055	I	884	“ Yeah , yeah , I know . ”
284071	284093	284067	284067	Jordan	655	“ But no matter how complex the situation may be , it ’s easy to see how he feels about you . ”
284102	284106	284094	284094	I	884	“ Is it ? ”
284127	284159	284120	284121	My driver	8335	“ Perhaps not to you . But to me , it ’s obvious . I pray that he ’ll figure out how to show you before you ’re gone for good . ”
284279	284289	284290	284290	She	166	“ Do you get sick of the bodyguard stuff ? ”
284296	284314	284290	284290	She	166	“ I mean , I would n’t get sick of that Jordan dude — he ’s hot . ”
284315	284319	284266	284266	Liesl	166	“ And gay . ”
284320	284330	284290	284290	She	166	“ Figures . But maybe he ’s also experimental . ”
284334	284338	284331	284331	I	884	“ Not likely . ”
284361	284398	284439	284439	He	380	“ I do n’t usually mind having bodyguards around , though I do like my independence . And I do n’t really get why I need to have someone here while I ’m at the club . ”
284403	284407	284439	284439	He	380	“ In fact — ”
284415	284420	284421	284421	I	884	“ Hey , stranger , ”
284426	284438	284421	284421	I	884	“ Guess what . I ’m giving you the night off . ”
284442	284502	284439	284439	He	380	“ I ’m serious . Hudson is probably the only one who has the power to give you the night off , but here ’s the thing — Hudson ’s not around . And I ’ll be here at the club all night . We have security guards on staff and bouncers . I ’m going to be fine . ”
284607	284621	284600	284600	she	9246	“ So I ’ll see you when I ’m off later . Okay ? ”
284626	284644	284622	284622	Reynold	380	“ Uh , sure . At three . I ’ll , uh , be here at three . ”
284645	284648	284622	284622	Reynold	380	“ Awesome . ”
284766	284778	284779	284779	Liesl	166	“ Maybe Hudson is really , like , a CIA guy , ”
284792	284824	284782	284782	I	884	“ And Celia ’s his partner . And he ’s abandoned his mission — defected , or whatever they call that , and she ’s trying to reel him back in . ”
284832	284839	284825	284825	Her	9246	“ That one ’s definitely it . ”
284857	284873	284840	284840	She	9246	“ I wish you ’d be serious about this . I know I ’m right . ”
284879	284899	284874	284874	I	884	“ Excuse me for being — what do they call it ? Oh , yeah — based in reality . ”
284911	284917	284900	284900	Liesl	166	“ Reality is so overrated . ”
284918	284923	284900	284900	Liesl	166	“ Is n’t it ? ”
285344	285349	285338	285338	I	884	“ Oh my god . ”
285350	285365	285366	285366	Her	9246	“ What ? What is it ? Did I fuck up the last order ? ”
285373	285382	285383	285383	I	884	“ No . She ’s here . Celia ! ”
285402	285413	285397	285397	Liesl	166	“ The stalker chick ? Should I kick her ass ? ”
285414	285417	285422	285424	the tall Amazon	3923	“ No . ”
285450	285474	285475	285475	She	166	“ No offense , but she ’s a knockout . Not like you ’re not a knockout , but I ’d do her . ”
285483	285495	285475	285475	She	166	“ I ’d do you harder , though . Of course . ”
285496	285508	285510	285510	I	884	“ Wow . I ca n’t believe she actually came here . ”
285582	285588	285589	285589	David	180	“ What ’s going on ? ”
285615	285618	285619	285619	I	884	“ Nothing . ”
285645	285656	285641	285641	Liesl	166	“ That girl over there is Laynie ’s crazy stalker . ”
285657	285660	285661	285661	I	884	“ Liesl ! ”
285672	285711	285641	285641	Liesl	166	“ I ’m not going to stand by as the only one who knows about this . You need some backup . What if she does something to you ? You know , roofies your drink or something . ”
285712	285723	285724	285724	She	166	“ Right . ‘ Cause I ’m drinking openly tonight . ”
285744	285757	285739	285739	Gwen	816	“ You have a stalker ? You ’re cooler than I thought . ”
285763	285781	285758	285758	I	884	“ She ’s not … it ’s not … I do n’t even know why she ’s … ”
285789	285807	285782	285782	I	884	“ It ’s complicated . I ’m going in the back room if you all need me . ”
285890	285897	285898	285898	David	180	“ Are you okay , Laynie ? ”
285906	285919	285921	285921	my	884	“ No . Yes . I ’m fine . I ’m just … ”I
285945	285957	285958	285958	Gwen	816	“ Well , tell us something about her . Your stalker . ”
285968	285979	285958	285958	Gwen	816	“ A name . How you know her . Anything . ”
285980	285987	285988	285988	I	884	“ Her name ’s Celia Werner . ”
286006	286012	286013	286013	David	180	“ As in Werner Media ? ”
286034	286040	286041	286041	I	884	“ That ’s the one , ”
286055	286076	286044	286044	David	180	“ It ’s nothing to worry about , David . She ’s just not happy about me being with Hudson . ”
286077	286083	286084	286084	Gwen	816	“ Is she the ex ? ”
286087	286090	286092	286092	I	884	“ Yeah . ”
286118	286122	286134	286134	her	816	“ She is . ”
286166	286190	286156	286156	I	884	“ So now she ’s trying to scare me by showing up where I am . Sending me messages . Stuff like that . ”
286191	286210	286212	286212	Hudson	1556	“ Do you want us to kick her out ? I can call Sorenson up from the door . ”
286232	286241	286212	286212	Hudson	1556	“ She ’s not going to hurt me . ”
286242	286247	286248	286248	David	180	“ Are you sure ? ”
286256	286259	286260	286260	I	884	“ No . ”
286281	286291	286272	286272	his	180	“ But I do n’t want her to win . ”
286292	286296	286297	286297	His	180	“ Fair enough . ”
286329	286343	286319	286319	Gwen	816	“ It ’s creepy how she just stares at you like she does . ”
286344	286349	286350	286350	I	884	“ Is n’t it ? ”
286367	286374	286319	286319	Gwen	816	“ We could spike her drink . ”
286380	286384	286319	286319	Gwen	816	“ With what ? ”
286385	286393	286319	286319	Gwen	816	“ I do n’t know . Spit . ”
286578	286587	286588	286588	I	884	“ You know what ? I ’m fine , ”
286591	286615	286588	286588	I	884	“ Do n’t worry about me . Let ’s get back out there where we can at least keep an eye on her . ”
286654	286657	286658	286658	she	816	“ Ah , ”
286661	286676	286677	286677	She	816	“ She knows we were talking about her . She ’s calling in reinforcements . ”
286684	286687	286677	286677	She	816	“ See ? ”
286727	286737	286715	286715	her	816	“ There you are , Laynie , phone call . ”
286738	286743	286744	286744	Gwen	816	“ Oh , shit . ”
286763	286769	286770	286770	David	180	“ Let me take it , ”
286773	286778	286779	286779	I	884	“ And say what ? ”
286785	286791	286779	286779	I	884	“ I ’ve got it . ”
286818	286821	286803	286803	I	884	“ Hello ? ”
286822	286830	286794	286794	she	816	“ Alayna , where is your bodyguard ? ”
286846	286849	286850	286850	I	884	“ Hudson . ”
286870	286877	286863	286863	they	3947	“ Hello to you , too . ”
286954	286963	286964	286964	Gwen	816	“ Ah , it ’s not even her , ”
286967	286974	286964	286964	Gwen	816	“ That was some mind fuck . ”
286978	286995	286975	286975	David	180	“ I think she must have been checking messages . I never saw her mouth move . ”
287012	287021	287022	287022	Hudson	1556	“ Could you answer the question , please ? ”
287072	287078	287063	287063	I	884	“ Why do you care ? ”
287079	287084	287085	287085	His	180	“ Goddammit , Alayna ! ”
287116	287134	287110	287110	Reynold	380	“ I sent him home . I figured I did n’t really need him at the club . ”
287135	287144	287145	287145	His	180	“ How ’s that working out for you ? ”
287152	287167	287145	287145	His	180	“ I ’m fine ! With the security guards and cameras and the bouncers … ”
287181	287190	287145	287145	His	180	“ How do you know she ’s here ? ”
287191	287197	287242	287242	Hudson	1556	“ Because I ’m outside . ”
287198	287208	287209	287209	My	884	“ You ’re outside ? Why are you outside ? ”
287232	287241	287224	287224	I	884	“ Liesl , hurry , grab the cordless . ”
287245	287269	287242	287242	Hudson	1556	“ Thank god your bodyguard works for me and not for you . You do n’t have the authority to send him home . ”
287277	287281	287242	287242	Hudson	1556	“ Jesus Christ . ”
287282	287289	287290	287290	Liesl	166	“ And when he noticed Celia … ”
287296	287300	287301	287301	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
287304	287313	287301	287301	I	884	“ Alayna , are you listening to me ? ”
287314	287326	287327	287327	I	884	“ Yes . I ’m working here too , you know . ”
287343	287347	287341	287341	Liesl	166	“ Go on . ”
287400	287460	287382	287382	his	884	“ When he saw Celia entering The Sky Launch , he contacted me , as he ’s supposed to do , and asked me if he should go in as well since you did n’t want him on the premises . I told him yes . So Reynold will be there whether you want him to be or not . ”
287461	287464	287465	287465	I	884	“ Fine . ”
287472	287478	287465	287465	I	884	“ Send him on in . ”
287479	287484	287465	287465	I	884	“ I already did . ”
287485	287491	287492	287492	I	884	“ Of course you did . ”
287519	287536	287538	287538	he	3952	“ But why are you here ? You could have arranged all that over the phone . ”
287555	287565	287552	287552	He	3952	“ I wanted to be sure you were okay . ”
287577	287582	287552	287552	He	3952	“ I ’m okay . ”
287602	287609	287552	287552	He	3952	“ I ’m safe , anyway . ”
287610	287613	287614	287614	He	3952	“ Good . ”
287619	287628	287614	287614	He	3952	“ Then I ’ll talk to you later . ”
287629	287634	287635	287635	I	884	“ Hudson , wait ! ”
287668	287675	287614	287614	He	3952	“ What is it , Alayna ? ”
287768	287779	287762	287762	I	884	“ Is that all you have to say to me ? ”
287780	287786	287787	287787	He	3952	“ Right now , yes . ”
287795	287808	287787	287787	He	3952	“ You ’re protected . That ’s what ’s important right now . ”
287880	287904	287865	287865	He	3952	“ Have you considered that if you just told Celia that you ’d left me that she ’d probably drop this whole thing ? ”
287921	287928	287905	287905	He	3952	“ I did n’t leave you . ”
287929	287937	287905	287905	He	3952	“ It sure feels like you did . ”
287955	287962	287938	287938	He	3952	“ Is that what you want ? ”
287963	287966	287938	287938	He	3952	“ No ! ”
287969	287982	287983	287984	The doorman	8793	“ No . I just want the truth . That ’s all . ”
288126	288135	288118	288118	I	884	“ Oh my god , are you … ? ”
288140	288148	288118	288118	I	884	“ Hudson , are you with Norma ? ”
288157	288163	288149	288149	Hudson	1556	“ Not now , Alayna . ”
288169	288186	288164	288164	I	884	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? One day gone and you ’re out with her ? ”
288199	288205	288187	288187	He	3952	“ It ’s for business ! ”
288230	288237	288243	288243	themselves	3969	“ At this time of night ? ”
288254	288266	288267	288267	He	3952	“ It’s … I ca n’t get into this right now . ”
288274	288284	288267	288267	He	3952	“ Why ca n’t you ever just trust me ? ”
288285	288295	288296	288296	I	884	“ Because you can never tell me the truth ! ”
288344	288361	288365	288365	Norma	10443	“ I have to go . I ca n’t talk to you while I ’m driving . ”
288382	288388	288372	288372	I	884	“ Wait , do n’t — ”
288389	288394	288365	288365	Norma	10443	“ Goodbye , Alayna . ”
288395	288400	288372	288372	I	884	“ — hang up . ”
288408	288411	288372	288372	I	884	“ Dammit ! ”
288441	288448	288449	288449	David	180	“ Laynie , are you okay ? ”
288480	288483	288449	288449	David	180	“ Yeah . ”
288537	288544	288545	288545	I	884	“ Yeah , I ’m fine , ”
288549	288555	288556	288556	I	884	“ I broke the phone . ”
288575	288583	288567	288567	David	180	“ It ’s technically Pierce ’s phone . ”
288584	288593	288556	288556	I	884	“ Well , that makes me feel better . ”
288596	288613	288556	288556	I	884	“ Funny , this is the second phone I ’ve destroyed on account of that man . ”
288614	288620	288567	288567	David	180	“ Maybe that means something . ”
288621	288624	288625	288625	I	884	“ Maybe . ”
288699	288721	288692	288692	David	180	“ I ’m not going to ask because I know what you ’ll say . I ’m just going to do . ”
288722	288725	288728	288728	I	884	“ What ? ”
288739	288742	288731	288731	I	884	“ Oh . ”
288743	288753	288728	288728	I	884	“ It seemed like you could use a hug . ”
288830	288836	288824	288824	I	884	“ I think I better … ”
288851	288860	288837	288837	David	180	“ Hey , look . She ’s leaving . ”
288919	288940	288913	288913	David	180	“ Man , I do n’t know anything about her , but that smile was wicked . What a bitch . ”
289032	289046	289026	289026	My	884	“ You know what ? This is ridiculous . I ’m confronting her . ”
289047	289058	289026	289026	My	884	“ Laynie , I ’m not so sure you should . ”
289098	289102	289103	289103	Reynold	380	“ Ms. Withers . ”
289117	289123	289103	289103	Reynold	380	“ Not a good idea . ”
289209	289228	289201	289201	he	380	“ One question , Reynold . Are you protecting me from her ? Or protecting her from me ? ”
289229	289237	289244	289244	he	380	“ I do n’t catch your drift . ”
289251	289255	289244	289244	he	380	“ Never mind . ”
289292	289311	289287	289287	I	884	“ You see that woman ? She ’s not to be let back in here . Permanently banned . ”
289316	289321	289312	289313	The doorman	8793	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
289322	289333	289334	289334	I	884	“ I ’ll hang her picture in the back room . ”
289463	289470	289474	289474	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna . I need you . ”
289489	289494	289482	289482	I	884	“ What is it ? ”
289495	289502	289503	289503	He	884	“ Mira . At the hospital . ”
289512	289516	289503	289503	He	884	“ The baby … ”
289533	289540	289517	289517	I	884	“ I ’ll be right there . ”
289541	289552	289503	289503	He	884	“ Jordan ’s already on his way to get you . ”
289614	289637	289638	289638	He	655	“ She ’s not in the ER anymore , but this is the only entrance open at this time of the morning . ”
289652	289664	289646	289646	I	884	“ Have you seen her ? What ’s going on exactly ? ”
289665	289696	289697	289697	He	655	“ All I know is that she ’s having contractions . Adam called as they were checking in and he texted me when they were moved to the OB ward . ”
289707	289718	289697	289697	He	655	“ I did n’t want to see her without you . ”
289803	289809	289790	289790	he	655	“ Alayna , about Norma … ”
289815	289825	289810	289810	I	884	“ You do n’t have to do this now . ”
289867	289878	289863	289863	Hudson	1556	“ I need you to know — this business deal . ”
289887	289946	289879	289879	He	655	“ It ’s very important and I ’ve had to be sneaky about the whole thing . Tonight was about that . Norma was able to arrange what looked like a chance meeting with the sellers at a charity gala . When Reynold called and said that you sent him away and that Celia was at the club ... ”
289959	289981	289947	289947	He	655	“ I did n’t even think to arrange a ride home for Norma . I simply grabbed her and we left . ”
289991	289997	289988	289988	my	884	“ Is the deal ruined ? ”
289998	290010	290011	290011	He	655	“ No . And it would n’t matter if it was . ”
290023	290037	290011	290011	He	655	“ You ’re safe , precious . That ’s all I care about . ”
290083	290095	290096	290096	I	884	“ Will they let us in at this time of night ? ”
290105	290121	290122	290122	he	655	“ It ’s my impression that babies are born twenty - four hours a day , ”
290125	290133	290122	290122	he	655	“ And we ’re on her list . ”
290153	290159	290144	290145	her baby	2725	“ May I help you ? ”
290167	290182	290144	290145	her baby	2725	“ We ’re here to see Mirabelle Sitkin . Hudson Pierce and Alayna Withers . ”
290198	290206	290194	290194	I	884	“ I guess we ’ve been approved . ”
290248	290251	290235	290235	He	700	“ Mother . ”
290252	290260	290261	290261	Sophia	1858	“ Thanks for being here , Hudson . ”
290309	290314	290315	290315	Her	1858	“ You brought her ? ”
290321	290334	290337	290337	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , and you ’ll not say another word about it . ”
290365	290375	290351	290351	Jack	10551	“ It ’s good to see you , Laynie . ”
290446	290452	290453	290453	he	10551	“ What ’s her status ? ”
290457	290464	290465	290465	Adam	700	“ She ’s fine . Now . ”
290481	290570	290465	290465	Adam	700	“ When we came in she was having contractions every three minutes . But they got her hooked up on an IV , got lots of fluids in her , and everything settled down . She has n’t had any contractions now for almost forty minutes . Her blood pressure is still a little high , though , so they want to keep her here a bit . Fortunately , they do n’t think it ’s pre - eclampsia , but they ’ll watch her at her visits . ”
290571	290585	290586	290586	Jack	10551	“ We can go back in as soon as the nurses are done , ”
290596	290616	290589	290589	Chandler	676	“ Mira said Mom and Dad were making her too tense . She sent us here for a timeout . ”
290637	290647	290624	290624	he	700	“ She is a bit feisty at the moment . ”
290666	290705	290654	290654	One	396	“ She ’s doing better , Dr. Sitkin . I ’m sure she ’ll be out of here in the next couple of hours . When you go back in , try to keep things light and relaxed . ”
290706	290709	290710	290710	Adam	700	“ Thanks . ”
290716	290733	290710	290710	Adam	700	“ After you , Laynie . I know she ’ll be happy to see you here . ”
290772	290775	290776	290776	I	884	“ Mira . ”
290782	290788	290789	290789	She	721	“ Hey ! You came ! ”
290806	290817	290818	290818	I	884	“ Of course we did . Do n’t be silly . ”
290859	290862	290863	290863	Mira	8319	“ Hudson . ”
290870	290877	290863	290863	Mira	8319	“ Thank you for being here . ”
291092	291099	291100	291100	she	8319	“ I have to tell you , ”
291108	291141	291142	291142	She	8319	“ this whole incident has proven one thing — labor is going to be a bitch . Those contractions hurt like a mother and when they hooked me up to this thing — ”
291148	291153	291142	291142	She	8319	“ They barely registered . ”
291163	291174	291154	291154	Sophia	1858	“ Has this finally changed your mind about taking Lamaze ? ”
291190	291212	291213	291213	She	8319	“ It ’s changed my mind about wanting drugs . I ’d like them as soon as I arrive , please . ”
291230	291242	291213	291213	She	8319	“ Can you add that to the birthing plan , honey ? ”
291243	291252	291253	291253	He	700	“ Add them ? I ’m demanding them . ”
291261	291277	291253	291253	He	700	“ Sorry , but you ’re not a nice person when you ’re in pain . ”
291283	291298	291278	291278	Mira	8319	“ You keep that up and I ’ll exclude you from the birthing room . ”
291315	291324	291312	291312	Chandler	676	“ I do n’t think she ’s joking . ”
291325	291337	291338	291338	Hudson	1556	“ Do they know what caused this in the first place ? ”
291380	291396	291371	291371	Mira	8319	“ A combination of dehydration and stress . Stress . Do you all hear that ? ”
291406	291413	291414	291414	She	8319	“ So you two right there — ”
291421	291438	291414	291414	She	8319	“ You need to get your shit together because you are hurting me and my baby . ”
291465	291470	291473	291473	Mira	8319	“ And you two — ”
291481	291527	291473	291473	Mira	8319	“ Do n’t think I do n’t notice how you ’re standing apart . And you ’re barely looking at each other . I do n’t even want to know what the hell is going on with you right now . Go work it out . ”
291591	291601	291580	291580	Chandler	676	“ Are you kicking out Mom and Dad too ? ”
291602	291620	291621	291621	She	8319	“ No . Their crap is too messed up to fix on demand . But those two — ”
291628	291637	291621	291621	She	8319	“ You better not be that messed up . ”
291638	291646	291647	291647	Chandler	676	“ Might as well get comfy then . ”
291694	291697	291688	291688	Hudson	1556	“ Mirabe — ”
291698	291726	291731	291731	her	1142	“ I ’m not kidding , Hudson . Leave . I do n’t want to see either of you until you ’ve got that happy glow again . ”
291736	291747	291731	291731	her	1142	“ See ? My blood pressure is spiking . Jesus . ”
291748	291751	291752	291752	Adam	700	“ Mira , ”
291755	291769	291752	291752	Adam	700	“ just take deep breaths . Settle down . Stop yelling at everyone . ”
291770	291784	291731	291731	her	1142	“ I ’m not yelling at everyone . I ’m yelling at them ! ”
291796	291801	291802	291802	Hudson	1556	“ We ’re going . ”
291813	291820	291821	291821	he	700	“ But we ’ll be back , ”
291827	291832	291833	291833	Mira	8319	“ Happy and glowing , ”
291992	292029	291979	291979	I	884	“ I know you want to be in there with your sister . I can leave . Or we can pretend things are all hunky - dory , if you ’d rather . I ’ll under — ”
292035	292040	292030	292030	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t leave . ”
292081	292088	292069	292069	I	884	“ Okay . I ’ll stay . ”
292089	292093	292110	292110	He	700	“ For Mira . ”
292098	292105	292094	292094	My	884	“ For Mira . Of course . ”
292233	292252	292223	292223	I	884	“ Then we need to put everything else aside for right now and give Mira our happy face . ”
292262	292266	292253	292253	He	4027	“ I agree . ”
292438	292459	292477	292477	his	4027	“ So any idea how to give Mira a happy face ? Because she read right through us in there . ”
292460	292466	292467	292467	Hudson	1556	“ She is very perceptive . ”
292483	292523	292524	292524	His	4027	“ But I think if we wait here for a while , give us time to supposedly talk things out , then if we go back in there with smiles and … holding hands , she ’ll believe it . ”
292536	292547	292524	292524	His	4027	“ She wants to believe it , so she will . ”
292560	292572	292548	292548	I	884	“ Pretending we ’re a couple . Just like old times . ”
292587	292613	292579	292579	He	4027	“ We are n’t pretending we ’re a couple . We are a couple . We ’re pretending that we’re … that we ’re not … ”
292647	292670	292643	292643	I	884	“ That we ’re not … what ? Not fighting ? Not completely confused and heartbroken ? Not miserable and lied to ? ”
292742	292777	292736	292736	I	884	“ I do n’t understand how you can say we ’re a couple when you ’re living in one place and I ’m in another . When you ’re on dates with another woman . ”
292778	292786	292787	292787	he	4027	“ I told you what that was , ”
292795	292811	292791	292791	I	884	“ When you wo n’t even let me touch you without acting like it burns . ”
292823	292837	292817	292817	I	884	“ I said I would n’t do this here . I ’m sorry . ”
292844	292848	292839	292839	I	884	“ Sort of . ”
292983	293001	292974	292974	Hudson	1556	“ Touching you only burns because it reminds me how much I want to touch you more . ”
293022	293032	293015	293015	my	884	“ Then touch me more , H. Come home . ”
293050	293059	293033	293033	He	4027	“ And you ’ll let the past lie ? ”
293155	293177	293146	293146	I	884	“ No . I ca n’t let it lie . But you can tell me what it is you ’re hiding . ”
293198	293225	293190	293190	we	4032	“ We might as well be broken up , Hudson , if you ca n’t believe that I ’d love you beyond whatever this secret is . ”
293284	293292	293278	293278	Hudson	1556	“ Let ’s not do this here . ”
293293	293298	293278	293278	Hudson	1556	“ Let ’s not . ”
293373	293406	293365	293365	I	884	“ Okay . We ’ll go in there . We ’ll smile . We ’ll hold hands . We ’ll be happy and glowing . And Mira will never know the lie . ”
293407	293410	293411	293411	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , ”
293414	293418	293411	293411	Hudson	1556	“ Thank you . ”
293419	293429	293365	293365	I	884	“ What if she asks what our problem was ? ”
293430	293435	293411	293411	Hudson	1556	“ She wo n’t . ”
293451	293462	293365	293365	I	884	“ If she does ask , let me handle it . ”
293463	293471	293474	293474	I	884	“ Yes , I ’ll do that . ”
293485	293495	293474	293474	I	884	“ You are the master manipulator , after all . ”
293577	293585	293574	293574	Hudson	1556	“ Are you ready to go back ? ”
293623	293634	293612	293612	his	4036	“ You think she ’ll believe this was long enough ? ”
293635	293638	293639	293639	He	884	“ Yes . ”
293651	293685	293686	293686	He	884	“ If we convince her that all is well , then she wo n’t focus on the timespan in the least . She ’ll have no reason to question what we ’re selling . ”
293711	293717	293718	293718	I	884	“ Tips from the expert , ”
293725	293747	293748	293748	He	884	“ You ’re very good at lashing out , precious . It ’s interesting that I ’m just learning this now . ”
293931	293948	293928	293928	he	884	“ Your hand fits so well in mine , does n’t it ? Like it belongs . ”
293979	293990	293991	293991	he	884	“ I did n’t mean to say that out loud , ”
293994	294004	293991	293991	he	884	“ I apologize . Can you still do this ? ”
294018	294021	294012	294012	I	884	“ Yep . ”
294022	294027	294028	294028	Hudson	1556	“ Showtime , then . ”
294043	294048	294049	294049	He	884	“ We ’re back . ”
294064	294070	294049	294049	He	884	“ And everything ’s fine . ”
294149	294164	294165	294165	She	8319	“ I want to hear it from Laynie . I do n’t trust you . ”
294209	294215	294190	294190	her	8319	“ Everything really is fine . ”
294236	294247	294232	294232	I	884	“ Maybe not perfect , but things are definitely fine . ”
294292	294308	294274	294274	He	884	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . Things are completely perfect . ”
294391	294406	294385	294385	She	8319	“ Ah , see ? The happy and glowing is back ! Thank god . ”
294443	294456	294437	294437	Hudson	1556	“ This is the best . Now my whole family ’s here . ”
294506	294515	294500	294500	Sophia	1858	“ Well , not everyone here is family . ”
294522	294581	294516	294516	Mira	8319	“ She is . And right now I ’d send you out before Laynie . Since I want all my family here , you can sit over there with your mouth shut and pretend you ’re shaking because you ’re cold and when you get home you can have the drink you wish was in that water bottle . ”
294608	294627	294600	294600	I	884	“ I should go , Mira . The sentiment is nice , but I ’m not really family . ”
294633	294639	294628	294628	Jack	10551	“ Yes . You are . ”
294647	294650	294640	294640	Hudson	1556	“ Agreed . ”
294808	294842	294802	294802	I	884	“ Take care of yourself , sister . I do n’t want to be back at Lenox Hill until you ’re pushing out a baby — and that better be months from now . ”
294843	294856	294802	294802	I	884	“ I could n’t agree more . Thanks for coming , Laynie . ”
294857	294860	294861	294861	I	884	“ Anytime . ”
294864	294872	294861	294861	I	884	“ Well , my ride ’s here . ”
294909	294914	294915	294915	Mira	8319	“ Your ride … ? ”
294928	294936	294937	294937	Hudson	1556	“ We ’re off to separate places , ”
294940	294957	294937	294937	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna gets to go home and crawl in bed . I ’m off to work . ”
294978	295001	294975	294975	Mira	8319	“ You ’re going to work after no sleep ? And I ’m the one getting yelled at about working too hard . ”
295008	295014	295015	295015	He	4056	“ I got enough sleep . ”
295029	295036	295037	295037	he	4056	“ I should kiss you goodbye , ”
295047	295058	295059	295059	I	884	“ I suppose you should . Do you want to ? ”
295128	295148	295121	295121	His	4056	“ I ’ve never kissed you just for show , precious . I ’m not about to start now . ”
295224	295256	295215	295215	I	884	“ That would be easier to believe if your actions matched your words . But , let me guess — you’re not about to start that now either , are you ? ”
295402	295411	295412	295412	she	8674	“ I told you , I ’m done , ”
295438	295454	295432	295432	I	884	“ Can you come over for a bit ? I need your help with something . ”
295455	295460	295461	295461	Liesl	166	“ Um , sure . ”
295485	295496	295479	295479	I	884	“ I need , like , twenty . And coffee . ”
295497	295512	295461	295461	Liesl	166	“ Awesome . I ’ll send my driver to get you . With Starbucks . ”
295674	295680	295681	295681	Liesl	166	“ Here ’s another one . ”
295687	295716	295681	295681	Liesl	166	“ ‘ Do n't cry , I 'm sorry to have deceived you so much , but that 's how life is . ’ It ’s from Lolita . ”
295727	295737	295720	295720	Nabokov	404	“ Put it in the to - go pile . ”
295770	295778	295750	295750	She	9246	“ What do you think it means ? ”

296036	296074	296031	296031	She	166	“ I think she ’s talking about herself . She does n’t think she ’s harming anyone , she ’s not going to give up , she thinks she controls stuff , and she ’s a bitch . ”
296088	296108	296075	296075	She	166	“ So spill it . Why did you so badly want me here for this only mildly entertaining task ? ”
296114	296124	296109	296109	I	884	“ I did n’t . There ’s something else . ”
296158	296176	296147	296147	Liesl	166	“ So let me get this straight — you’re going to obsess and stalk people on purpose ? ”
296177	296180	296181	296181	I	884	“ Research , ”
296184	296192	296181	296181	I	884	“ Research , dammit ! Not stalk . ”
296210	296245	296147	296147	Liesl	166	“ You ’re obsessed with your boy toy ’s past . And you want to track down people to research whatever he ’s hiding from you . Right ? Or did I miss something ? ”
296246	296252	296253	296253	I	884	“ That ’s exactly it . ”
296260	296302	296253	296253	I	884	“ That ’s not stalking . That ’s talking to people . People who have insight into Hudson . If he wo n’t tell me what I want to know , then I can ask them . Get a clearer picture . ”
296310	296319	296320	296320	I	884	“ Why is this not an ideal plan ? ”
296340	296352	296353	296353	She	166	“ Because you have a history of being , you know ... ”
296375	296426	296353	296353	She	166	“ I ’ll just say it . Cuckoo . You ’ve been cuckoo . And I have n’t been to that many of your group thingies , but I seem to remember that snooping and prying and digging into people ’s stuff are all on the no - no list . ”
296461	296466	296455	296455	she	166	“ This is different . ”
296470	296476	296467	296467	She	166	“ Yes , it is . ”
296486	296490	296478	296478	she	166	“ How exactly ? ”
296503	296532	296492	296492	I	884	“ The other times it was a compulsion . I could n’t help myself . This time , I ’m choosing it . It makes it totally different . ”
296533	296541	296542	296542	She	166	“ Uh - huh . Totally different . ”
296548	296574	296542	296542	She	166	“ And why am I here ? ‘ Cause if you want me to tell you you ’re not crazy , that ’s not happening . ”
296575	296587	296588	296588	Liesl	166	“ Then , well , fine . Think I ’m crazy . ”
296602	296610	296588	296588	Liesl	166	“ But I also need your help . ”
296616	296627	296628	296628	She	166	“ You want me to take down that Selina bitch ? ”
296639	296642	296643	296643	I	884	“ Celia , ”
296646	296656	296643	296643	I	884	“ What is with you and getting names wrong ? ”
296657	296675	296676	296676	She	166	“ It ’s fun to watch you get all I - know - everything and correct me . ”
296685	296717	296676	296676	She	166	“ I really will take Ms. Celia Werner down if you want me to . I ’ll kick her ass so hard she ’ll lose that cute bubble butt of hers . ”
296724	296736	296676	296676	She	166	“ Yeah , I checked out her behind . Sue me . ”
296737	296748	296749	296749	Liesl	166	“ Um , no . No ass kicking . Please . ”
296826	296839	296818	296818	I	884	“ I was hoping you could come with me to see someone . ”
296840	296855	296906	296906	Liesl	166	“ Oh , Jesus . You ’re trying to convert me to stalking too ? ”
296856	296862	296818	296818	I	884	“ There ’s no stalking . ”
296872	296905	296818	296818	I	884	“ I just need to talk to a lady that does n’t want to talk to me . I ’m hoping if I ’m not alone , she might be more amicable . ”
296915	296937	296906	296906	Liesl	166	“ You think I ’m intimidating , do n’t you ? You want me to intimidate the fuck out of her . ”
296938	296943	296906	296906	Liesl	166	“ Yeah . Sure . ”
296952	296965	296944	296944	Her	166	“ God , I do n’t know , I do n’t know ! ”
296976	297016	297017	297017	She	166	“ The whole thing seems really fun . And I want to be a good friend . But I ’m not sure if I should be supporting you or putting up a big fat stop sign in your path . ”
297029	297044	297017	297017	She	166	“ What to do , what to do ? Maybe we should call Brian . ”
297052	297070	297045	297045	I	884	“ You should be supporting me . Please ! And we do n’t need to call Brian . ”
297136	297153	297154	297154	I	884	“ Okay . You might be right — this might not be the healthiest of ideas . ”
297166	297281	297282	297282	My	884	“ But here ’s the thing — if I do n’t take some control over this limbo state that my relationship is in , then I ’m going to end up doing the stalking and obsessing and all of that anyway . I ’m being proactive . I ’m taking a stand for once instead of letting a guy walk all over me . Because if not this , I only have two other choices — let Hudson and me stay in this ‘ time apart ’ mode , which is asinine and unproductive and really leaves me as a doormat . Or break up . And I ’m not ready to lose him . ”
297290	297311	297282	297282	My	884	“ And I do n’t think he ’s ready to lose me . Or he would have ended things already . ”
297322	297331	297312	297312	Liesl	166	“ You are so overthinking this , Laynie . ”
297341	297357	297332	297332	I	884	“ No ! I ’m not . I ’m fighting for the guy I love . ”
297375	297409	297332	297332	I	884	“ Yes , I ’m pissed that he ’s not fighting for me , but maybe he does n’t know how to fight for anyone . Maybe he needs me to show him . ”
297420	297441	297416	297416	she	166	“ All right , I ’m in . What else am I going to do with my afternoon , anyway ? ”
297442	297451	297452	297452	I	884	“ Really ? Thank you . Thank you ! ”
297498	297514	297494	297494	she	166	“ It ’s all good . Besides , this book project is pretty much done . ”
297541	297552	297578	297578	I	884	“ Then I ’m ready to go if you are . ”
297553	297556	297557	297557	She	166	“ Yup . ”
297565	297572	297557	297557	She	166	“ Where we headed , anyway ? ”
297573	297577	297557	297557	She	166	“ Greenwich Village . ”
297637	297653	297632	297632	Liesl	166	“ Have you considered that you might not like what you uncover with all this ? ”
297670	297685	297632	297632	Liesl	166	“ I ’m pretty certain that whatever it is , it might kill me . ”
297745	297768	297741	297741	he	655	“ It might kill me , but I need to know . And then I can move on , preferably with Hudson . ”
298073	298105	298068	298068	I	884	“ This is where I need you . There ’s a peephole . If Stacy looks through it and sees me , I ’m not sure she ’ll open the door . ”
298106	298113	298134	298134	she	166	“ Cool . I got this . ”
298145	298151	298152	298152	Stacy	8674	“ Hi . Vanessa Vanderhal ? ”
298175	298183	298184	298184	Stacy	8674	“ Oh , no . Not you . ”
298206	298249	298192	298192	Liesl	166	“ Hey , she only has a few questions . Nothing that ’s going to take more than a few minutes . You ’re the only one she can ask . Ca n’t you help a girl out ? Woman to woman ? ”
298317	298371	298308	298308	She	8674	“ If you are n’t interested in doing this the easy way , I ’m willing to go another route . I ’ll introduce myself — I’m Liesl . I have a triple black belt in karate and I do competitive boxing on the side . So come on . Let us in . ”
298396	298418	298393	298393	Stacy	8674	“ Oh , all right . Come on in . But make it quick . I have a client in fifteen . ”
298456	298472	298448	298448	I	884	“ Thank you , Stacy . We ’ll be in and out . I promise . ”
298483	298488	298473	298473	She	9246	“ Yeah , yeah . ”
298495	298507	298492	298492	she	9246	“ I knew there would n’t be an end to this . ”
298528	298553	298515	298515	she	9246	“ What is it you want to know ? I did n’t stage the video , if that ’s what he ’s convinced you . ”
298576	298583	298586	298586	he	4094	“ No , he did n’t . ”
298649	298652	298653	298653	I	884	“ Actually , ”
298656	298669	298653	298653	I	884	“ he wo n’t tell me anything about the video at all . ”
298670	298676	298677	298677	Stacy	8674	“ Ah , I see . ”
298686	298695	298677	298677	Stacy	8674	“ And so you ’re asking me instead . ”
298788	298820	298783	298783	I	884	“ Yes , that ’s exactly what I ’m doing . I ’m going behind his back and asking you instead . It ’s definitely not one of my finer moments . ”
298830	298844	298821	298821	Stacy	8674	“ Well , we ’ve all experienced some of those , I suppose . ”
298852	298862	298821	298821	Stacy	8674	“ So he does n’t know you ’re here ? ”
298868	298878	298863	298863	I	884	“ And you ’re not planning to tell him ? ”
298879	298882	298863	298863	I	884	“ No . ”
299006	299019	299001	299001	I	884	“ Actually , that ’s a lie . I will tell him . ”
299033	299050	299001	299001	I	884	“ I told you before — we’re working on honesty . I ca n’t betray him . ”
299118	299126	299107	299107	she	8674	“ What do you want to know ? ”
299138	299165	299133	299133	I	884	“ Why did you film Hudson and Celia kissing ? I mean , what did you plan to do with the video in the first place ? ”
299166	299172	299173	299173	She	8674	“ Prove he was lying . ”
299202	299262	299199	299199	she	8674	“ I was supposed to meet him that night . For coffee — I think I told you that before . As I was walking up , I saw him with her . He ’d protested so much about them being a couple that I knew he ’d deny it again . So I filmed it . As proof . ”
299282	299291	299292	299292	She	8674	“ But you never showed it to him . ”
299297	299325	299292	299292	She	8674	“ I did n’t end up needing to . I walked up to them right after I filmed it . While they were still ... like that . ”
299419	299444	299408	299408	Stacy	8674	“ I ’d filmed them in case they stopped before I got there . In case he denied it . But he did n’t . ”
299468	299478	299450	299450	Hudson	1556	“ What did he do when he saw you ? ”
299489	299593	299484	299484	she	8674	“ He acted surprised , even though I was supposed to be meeting him . Or maybe it was because he ’d lost track of time or forgotten he was meeting me . I do n’t know . Celia apologized first , which was strange because I did n’t realize she knew anything about me . Then Hudson apologized . Most of the explaining came from Celia . I guess he was shocked to have been caught or something . I really did n’t listen to most of what she said . I was shocked as well . And too busy feeling stupid . ”
299594	299598	299484	299484	she	8674	“ Feeling stupid ? ”
299623	299641	299642	299642	She	8674	“ Yes , stupid . He ’d made me feel like he liked me , you know ? ”
299656	299672	299642	299642	She	8674	“ And all the time he was with her . Why would he do that ? ”
299673	299683	299684	299684	Liesl	166	“ Why do any men cheat on their women ? ”
299739	299776	299732	299732	Stacy	8674	“ He asked me to meet him , though . Hudson Pierce does n’t seem like the type to mix up his dates . If anyone could successfully pull off an affair , that man could . ”
299832	299857	299826	299826	Stacy	8674	“ How did he make you feel like he liked you ? I thought you only accompanied him to that charity event last year . ”
299868	299877	299865	299865	I	884	“ I did n’t realize you were together . ”
299883	299891	299878	299878	Stacy	8674	“ We were n’t . Not really . ”
299902	299963	299892	299892	She	8674	“ After that charity event he never asked me out again . But we talked a lot — by email . He flirted . Sent me flowers a couple of times . That ’s why I thought there was a possibility . That night on the video was the first time he ’d offered to see me in person again . ”
299964	299973	299974	299974	Liesl	166	“ Maybe they were dicking with you together . ”
299978	299980	299974	299974	Liesl	166	“ manicured ”
299986	299999	299974	299974	Liesl	166	“ You know . Like maybe the emails were n’t from him . ”
300000	300007	300008	300008	I	884	“ You mean Celia sent them ? ”
300032	300039	300024	300024	she	9246	“ Yeah , she could have . ”
300082	300116	300067	300067	She	8674	“ Are you saying that you think Hudson could n’t possibly like me ? That ’s pretty nervy to assume . What , you do n’t think I ’m good enough for him ? ”
300147	300242	300135	300135	I	884	“ No . That ’s not it at all . There ’s just details that do n’t add up . Like you said he seemed surprised to see you there . And when I mentioned you being there to meet him , he had no idea what I was talking about . Total deer in the headlights . Maybe he was faking his reaction — I’m not denying that ’s a possibility . But that ’s exactly why I wanted to talk to you . I ’m trying to figure it out for myself . ”
300250	300258	300243	300243	Liesl	166	“ And tell her about Celia WerWhore . ”
300270	300315	300259	300259	I	884	“ That ’s the other thing , Stacy . Celia tried to pull a scam on me recently . And now she ’s messing with me in other ways . I may not be the first of Hudson ’s interests to get that treatment . ”
300334	300352	300324	300324	her	8674	“ So when he took me to the charity event , I showed up on her radar ? ”
300353	300356	300357	300357	I	884	“ Possibly . ”
300375	300380	300364	300364	Hudson	1556	“ And possibly not . ”
300501	300537	300493	300493	I	884	“ But even if it was n’t Hudson who wrote those emails , Celia obviously thought you were a threat . That has to mean he showed some interest in you in front of her . ”
300546	300560	300538	300538	Stacy	8674	“ It ’s actually an interesting theory . It fits in some ways . ”
300561	300565	300566	300566	Liesl	166	“ Do tell . ”
300578	300635	300538	300538	Stacy	8674	“ Like I said , he did act strange when I came up to him . And whenever he came in the shop , he ignored me . As if he had n’t said all the beautiful things he ’d said to me online . He was very poetic . His emails were like long letters . ”
300636	300649	300650	300650	I	884	“ I ’m not claiming to know who the actual author was , ”
300662	300692	300650	300650	I	884	“ but from what I know of Hudson , he ’s not much of a letter writer . And Celia does seem to be comfortable around the literary world . ”
300709	300719	300721	300721	Liesl	166	“ What was the email address he sent from ? ”
300736	300742	300731	300731	Stacy	8674	“ H.Pierce@gmail.com , I think . ”
300753	300759	300743	300743	I	884	“ Is that his email ? ”
300760	300786	300789	300789	he	4110	“ I only know of his Pierce Industries account . He uses it for both business and personal , but he rarely sends personal emails . ”
300877	300895	300896	300896	She	4111	“ Thanks again , for your time and your answers . I know you ’re busy now . ”
300920	300937	300917	300917	she	4111	“ I should be thanking you too , I suppose . You ’ve enlightened the situation . ”
300947	300959	300938	300938	She	4111	“ Vanessa ? Welcome to Mirabelle ’s . Come on in . ”
300970	300978	300979	300979	Stacy	8674	“ If I think of anything else , ”
300984	300990	300979	300979	Stacy	8674	“ I ’ll contact you . ”
301026	301028	301018	301018	she’d	4111	“ Hudson ”
301085	301093	301072	301072	Liesl	166	“ Do you think you learned anything ? ”
301097	301135	301094	301094	I	884	“ I ’d like to believe it was all a scam on Celia ’s part . But that does n’t answer why Hudson was kissing her or why he wo n’t tell me the truth about it . ”
301136	301159	301195	301195	people	726	“ Maybe she asked him to play along . Would he do that ? Or he was in on it all along . ”
301165	301173	301160	301160	I	884	“ All of those options are possible . ”
301298	301304	301286	301287	The doorman	8793	“ Not her , right ? ”
301305	301308	301309	301309	I	884	“ Right . ”
301376	301381	301373	301373	she	419	“ Hi , Laynie . ”
301726	301737	301738	301738	I	884	“ Jordan , I need to go to Pierce Industries ? ”
301789	301796	301797	301797	He	4137	“ Certainly , Ms … Laynie . ”
301811	301821	301808	301808	he	4137	“ I ’m sure he ’ll enjoy the surprise . ”
302040	302063	302033	302033	I	884	“ Give me a few minutes before you report me , will you ? I do n’t want to ruin the surprise . ”
302080	302084	302085	302085	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
302514	302522	302507	302507	I	884	“ Alayna Withers to see Norma Anders . ”
302523	302546	302505	302505	Boyd	421	“ Let me just buzz her to see if she ’s ready for you . Please feel free to take a seat . ”
302563	302573	302557	302557	I	884	“ No , I ’ll stand . Thank you . ”
302689	302696	302697	302697	She	10443	“ Alayna , please come in . ”
302731	302740	302720	302720	she	10443	“ Stop it . You ’re being bad . ”
302760	302764	302752	302752	I	884	“ Excuse me ? ”
302765	302777	302779	302779	she	10443	“ Oh , nothing . I was talking to my assistant . ”
302866	302885	302863	302863	she	10443	“ I was surprised by your request to meet with me . I assume it ’s about Gwen ? ”
302903	302915	302898	302898	I	884	“ It ’s personal . I ’m her sister ’s boss . ”
302966	302998	302957	302957	I	884	“ No , I ’m not here about Gwen . Though I may have led your assistant to believe that ’s what it was about . I apologize for that deception . ”
303003	303013	302999	302999	Norma	10443	“ Now my interest is piqued . Go on . ”
303021	303031	303014	303014	I	884	“ I ’m here to ask you about Hudson . ”
303032	303035	303036	303036	She	10443	“ Hudson ? ”
303046	303078	303036	303036	She	10443	“ You could n’t have shocked me more if you said you were here to talk about the pope . Why on earth would you be asking me about your boyfriend ? ”
303185	303198	303181	303181	I	884	“ I ’m interested in your relationship with him . With Hudson . ”
303207	303221	303199	303199	Her	8844	“ Call me a bitch , but why are n’t you asking him ? ”
303272	303288	303257	303257	I	884	“ I have asked him . He ’s answered . I ’d like your clarification . ”
303297	303318	303289	303289	She	8844	“ I have a business relationship with him . He ’s my boss . I ’m his lead financial officer . ”
303319	303323	303289	303289	She	8844	“ Business only ? ”
303324	303328	303289	303289	She	8844	“ Business only . ”
303419	303437	303438	303438	She	8844	“ You obviously find him attractive . You do n’t hide it when you look at him . ”
303461	303469	303454	303454	Norma	10443	“ He ’s a very attractive man . ”
303474	303485	303454	303454	Norma	10443	“ But I ’m not interested in him that way . ”
303508	303519	303502	303502	Hudson	1556	“ He said you approached him about having a relationship . ”
303526	303530	303520	303520	Her	8844	“ Did he ? ”
303550	303576	303547	303547	Norma	10443	“ Well , I did . Quite a while ago . I ’m simply surprised it meant enough to mention . Things have changed now . ”
303634	303645	303624	303624	Hudson	1556	“ He does n’t seem to think things have changed . ”
303660	303671	303646	303646	She	1556	“ Maybe I do n’t want him to think so . ”
303737	303749	303725	303725	She	1556	“ He ’s my boss . It pays to flatter him . ”
303757	303770	303750	303750	I	884	“ There ’s more than that . What are you not saying ? ”
303810	303860	303795	303795	I	884	“ I ’m sorry . It ’s none of my business , I know . But I ’m desperate for information . It would mean a lot to me . And with Gwen at the club now , I thought maybe we could find some sort of a bond . ”
303874	303890	303862	303862	her	1556	“ Are you threatening Gwen ’s job security if I do n’t answer your questions ? ”
303893	303904	303992	303992	Norma	10443	“ No ! God , no . I love Gwen . ”
303909	303935	303936	303936	Jesus	680	“ Or , I like her anyway . A lot . She ’s good at the job . Perfect for what I was looking for . ”
303951	303991	303942	303942	I	884	“ I mean that I think of everyone at The Sky Launch as family . Gwen ’s moving her way into that category quite nicely . Even though she ’s sometimes blunt and overly anxious to speak her mind . ”
303995	304002	303992	303992	Norma	10443	“ That ’s Gwen for you . ”
304015	304066	303992	303992	Norma	10443	“ I appreciate you getting her the job , by the way . I thanked Hudson , but he says it ’s really you who hired her . She needed out of Eighty - Eighth . In many ways , she was as desperate as you say you are now . ”
304081	304101	304067	304067	She	10443	“ And for that reason — because of what you did for Gwen — I’ll share something with you . ”
304110	304119	304102	304102	She	10443	“ Boyd , can you come in here ? ”
304127	304130	304120	304120	Boyd	421	“ Certainly . ”
304188	304194	304173	304173	Boyd	421	“ May I help you ? ”
304221	304239	304211	304211	Norma	10443	“ Boyd , Ms. Withers wants to know if I ’m having an affair with Hudson Pierce . ”
304270	304286	304287	304287	Her	10443	“ It ’s okay , dear . Answer honestly . As honestly as you like . ”
304321	304326	304314	304314	he	421	“ She is not . ”
304341	304359	304335	304335	I	884	“ How can you be certain ? Are you there when she has her meetings with him ? ”
304360	304373	304374	304374	He	421	“ I am not . But I know that she is n’t . ”
304398	304412	304394	304394	he	421	“ She would n’t do that to the person she ’s involved with . ”
304423	304429	304413	304413	He	421	“ She ’s very loyal . ”
304430	304440	304394	304394	he	421	“ Thank you , Boyd . That ’s all . ”
304460	304467	304471	304471	her	10443	“ You ’re involved with someone ? ”
304477	304486	304471	304471	her	10443	“ Oh my god , it ’s Boyd ! ”
304502	304527	304496	304497	the woman	10443	“ Now do you really think I would fool around with someone else in the office when my lover is right outside my door ? ”
304532	304544	304528	304528	I	884	“ Why did n’t Hudson just tell me you were involved ? ”
304591	304597	304598	304598	I	884	“ Hudson does n’t know , ”
304601	304612	304598	304598	I	884	“ Why ? Is it a big secret or something ? ”
304613	304671	304706	304707	a bitch	8470	“ Corporate policy is no dating within the same department . Boyd would be transferred . I do n’t want to lose him . He ’s worked for me for two years ; we ’ve been together for half that time . He ’s the best assistant I ’ve ever had . In more ways than one . ”
304672	304690	304691	304691	I	884	“ And perpetuating the idea that you ’re still into Hudson is to throw him off track . ”
304698	304701	304691	304691	I	884	“ Gotcha . ”
304728	304754	304726	304726	me	884	“ I feel like an idiot . I ’m sorry to have assumed . And do n’t worry — your secret is safe with me . ”
304758	304769	304755	304755	She	1124	“ Thanks . It ’s actually fun to tell someone . ”
304774	304779	304755	304755	She	1124	“ I ’m sure . ”
304862	304880	304881	304881	I	884	“ So if there is n’t any romantic interest , why are you with Hudson so much ? ”
304912	304919	304907	304907	Norma	10443	“ He has n’t told you ? ”
304931	304938	304926	304926	she	10443	“ Well , maybe I understand . ”
304955	305105	304952	304952	she	10443	“ It ’s a very complicated idea he ’s working on . He owns stock in a company but wants to purchase enough to have a controlling interest . But he does n’t want the board members to be aware that he has the controlling interest . So he ’s in the process of buying out another company that has enough stock in the first company to equal controlling interest when combined with the shares he already owns . Since he ’s doing this all under the radar , we ’ve had to be covert about the purchase . It ’s all been like a game . Chess moves . We move , they move . I ’ve had to research financial laws and tactics I ’ve never encountered before . It will be a miracle if it goes through , but I ’m beginning to believe in miracles . ”
305147	305155	305156	305156	she	1556	“ Hudson ’s methods have been brilliant , ”
305159	305170	305156	305156	she	1556	“ He ’s a fascinating man to watch in action . ”
305171	305182	305183	305183	I	884	“ It ’s obvious you love your job , Norma . ”
305189	305220	305183	305183	I	884	“ Hudson ’s mind is certainly one of the most creative I ’ve ever encountered . It must be a real thrill to get to work with him so closely . ”
305244	305254	305313	305313	I	884	“ And I ’m not insinuating anything by that . ”
305255	305268	305269	305269	Her	1556	“ I understood what you meant . And yes , it is . ”
305274	305312	305269	305269	Her	1556	“ By the way , I meant it when I said that I think you ’re a much better match for him than that Werner girl . She made him miserable . You make him almost happy . ”
305371	305395	305359	305359	I	884	“ Why do you believe he was with Celia ? Did he ever tell you he was ? Did you see them together ? ”
305402	305427	305396	305396	She	10443	“ He never said they were . She accompanied him to many of the office functions . I simply assumed . Were they not ? ”
305438	305455	305428	305428	I	884	“ Did you ever see them intimate together ? You know , holding hands ? Kissing ? ”
305456	305463	305464	305464	She	10443	“ No , I did n’t . ”
305479	305529	305464	305464	She	10443	“ That ’s part of what seemed miserable about them as a couple — they were so unaffectionate when they were together . There was never the shine in his eyes like there is when he ’s with you . Even when he talks about you , he glows . ”
305534	305540	305532	305532	me	884	“ He talks about me ? ”
305541	305546	305547	305547	She	10443	“ All the time . ”
305572	305579	305566	305566	My	884	“ Hmm . I never knew . ”
305761	305764	305748	305748	he	655	“ Alayna . ”
305855	305865	305866	305866	He	655	“ Let ’s talk in private , shall we ? ”
305873	305878	305879	305879	he	655	“ Hold my calls , ”
305966	305972	305962	305962	I	884	“ Well , hello , H. ”
305978	305987	305973	305973	He	655	“ What are you doing here , Alayna ? ”
306103	306121	306122	306122	I	884	“ What am I doing here in your office ? You dragged me in here , remember . ”
306138	306144	306146	306146	I	884	“ Do n’t be cute . ”
306157	306164	306146	306146	I	884	“ I meant in the building . ”
306173	306193	306165	306165	I	884	“ Maybe I came to see you . I tend to stalk when I feel dismissed by a man . ”
306213	306241	306208	306208	Hudson	1556	“ You did n’t come to see me . You arrived on this floor over half an hour ago and are just now coming by my office . ”
306247	306264	306242	306242	I	884	“ How the fuck do you know everything I do ? Jordan ? Your security cameras ? ”
306329	306351	306352	306352	He	655	“ I ’m not going to feel guilty for the lengths I go to in order to protect what ’s mine . ”
306381	306384	306371	306371	his	655	“ Alayna ? ”
306402	306413	306385	306385	I	884	“ Yours , huh ? Do n’t make me laugh . ”
306449	306465	306443	306443	My	884	“ Jesus , how many times do I have to go through this with you ? ”
306466	306472	306473	306473	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
306477	306493	306473	306473	I	884	“ Maybe a couple hundred more times . Because I ’m obviously not getting it . ”
306519	306528	306514	306514	he	655	“ Why . Are . You . Here ? ”
306568	306575	306576	306576	His	655	“ I came to see Norma . ”
306580	306584	306576	306576	His	655	“ About Gwen ? ”
306596	306614	306585	306585	I	884	“ About you , you dummy . I do n’t give a shit about anything but you . ”
306625	306641	306585	306585	I	884	“ Jesus , how many times do I have to go through this with you ? ”
306667	306678	306679	306679	His	655	“ You came to talk to my employee about me ? ”
306717	306728	306709	306709	I	884	“ Do n’t guilt me for protecting what ’s mine . ”
306774	306796	306763	306763	I	884	“ I only wanted to see for myself if she was into you . If you had something going with her . ”
306810	306840	306807	306807	I	884	“ And do n’t you dare talk to me about trust because you know I get jealous about her , and you are n’t around to help reassure me . ”
306916	306925	306907	306907	he	4191	“ Did you get what you came for ? ”
306926	306930	306893	306893	his	4191	“ I did . ”
306931	306934	306907	306907	he	4191	“ And ? ”
306955	306985	306952	306952	I	884	“ She thinks a lot of you . She respects you and admires you and she recognizes you ’re physically attractive — don’t let that go to your head . ”
306986	306989	306893	306893	his	4191	“ But … ”
306990	307007	306952	306952	I	884	“ But she ’s not into you anymore . I can see it in her eyes . ”
307030	307043	307044	307044	He	4192	“ Good . Then you believe the things I ’ve told you . ”
307048	307073	307044	307044	He	4192	“ It was never the things you ’ve told me that were the issue . It ’s the things you have n’t told me . ”
307074	307083	307084	307084	he	4192	“ They are n’t your things to know , ”
307097	307104	307105	307105	I	884	“ What the ever living fuck ? ”
307118	307174	307105	307105	I	884	“ I could say the same thing about you — spying on me , digging into my history before you ’d even met me — maybe I think those are n’t your things to know . Still , you did and do whatever the hell you want with no regard to boundaries or personal space . ”
307185	307216	307175	307175	I	884	“ And while that ’s out there , let me be clear — since you are n’t able to explain things to me , I ’m digging on my own . ”
307245	307301	307236	307236	he	4192	“ That ’s right . I ’ve been through all of the books Celia sent . I ’ve been to see Stacy . And Norma . I ’m collecting my own facts . Do n’t you think it would be better to tell me your secrets than have me find them out on my own ? ”
307302	307308	307309	307309	He	4192	“ Alayna , stop digging . ”
307338	307349	307329	307329	he	4192	“ You ’re protecting Celia again , are n’t you ? ”
307350	307359	307329	307329	he	4192	“ Celia ’s not who I ’m protecting . ”
307360	307366	307367	307367	I	884	“ Who then ? Yourself ? ”
307385	307388	307367	307367	I	884	“ Me ? ”
307400	307408	307389	307389	He	4192	“ You need to leave , now . ”
307487	307535	307478	307478	I	884	“ Shutting me out again . Like you always do . Hiding behind your thick walls . What ’s the point of me even fighting for you if you ’re never , never going to let me in ? Who are you protecting , Hudson ? Who ? ”
307542	307557	307536	307536	His	4192	“ Yes , you , dammit ! I ’m protecting you . Always you . ”
308168	308182	308154	308154	I	884	“ Oh god , I miss you . I miss you so much . ”
308183	308192	308193	308193	He	4192	“ Précieux … mon amour … ma chérie … ”
308256	308263	308246	308246	I	884	“ When are you coming home ? ”
308281	308292	308264	308264	He	4192	“ I have to go to L.A. for the weekend . ”
308303	308317	308293	308293	He	4192	“ I ’m set to leave in about twenty minutes , in fact . ”
308381	308392	308365	308365	I	884	“ Part of your big business thing ? With Norma ? ”
308437	308457	308427	308427	Hudson	1556	“ Yes , with Norma . And after this , if all goes well , we ’ll be done . ”
308761	308773	308750	308750	He	4192	“ God , Alayna , I ca n’t do this anymore . ”
308780	308797	308750	308750	He	4192	“ I ca n’t bear to be apart from you . I miss you so terribly . ”
308798	308802	308803	308803	I	884	“ You do ? ”
308839	308848	308849	308849	His	4192	“ Of course , I do , precious . ”
308856	308872	308849	308849	His	4192	“ You ’re my everything . I love you . I love you so much . ”
309017	309024	309006	309006	I	884	“ W - w - what ? ”
309033	309038	309025	309025	His	4192	“ You heard me . ”
309039	309047	309048	309048	I	884	“ I want to hear it again . ”
309115	309120	309101	309101	I	884	“ I love you . ”
309121	309126	309127	309127	He	4192	“ You love me ? ”
309134	309164	309127	309127	He	4192	“ I love you , precious . I ’ve always loved you . From the moment I first saw you . I knew before you did , I think . ”
309174	309223	309165	309165	He	4192	“ But there are things — things in my past — that have kept me from being able to tell you . And now … I have to do this … this thing . Finish this deal . Then , when I get back , we ’ll talk . ”
309224	309229	309230	309230	I	884	“ We ’ll talk ? ”
309259	309282	309283	309283	He	4192	“ I ’ll tell you anything you want to know . And if you still want me , I ’ll come home . ”
309318	309357	309312	309312	he	4192	“ Yes , I want you home . Of course I do . We belong there together . There ’s nothing you could say that would make me stop loving you . Nothing . I stick , remember ? ”
309363	309374	309358	309358	He	4192	“ Oh , precious . I hope that ’s true . ”
309375	309379	309358	309358	He	4192	“ It is . ”
309477	309482	309465	309465	I	884	“ Say it again . ”
309483	309491	309492	309492	He	4192	“ You ’re such a spoiled girl . ”
309499	309507	309492	309492	He	4192	“ And I love … spoiling you . ”
309516	309522	309523	309523	He	4192	“ And I love you . ”
309531	309544	309523	309523	He	4192	“ I love you , I love you . I love you . ”
309640	309646	309647	309647	he	4192	“ I ’ll miss you , ”
309665	309674	309654	309654	he	4192	“ You could ask me to come to L.A. ”
309675	309689	309690	309690	He	4192	“ Someone keeps reminding me about a club that she has to run … ”
309705	309726	309690	309690	He	4192	“ And I ’m going to be swamped . Though I ’d love you there , you ’d be ignored . ”
309788	309813	309783	309783	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t pout . Stay here , go to David ’s going away party on Sunday , I ’ll be back by Monday . ”
309814	309820	309821	309821	I	884	“ Back to the penthouse ? ”
309843	309851	309852	309852	He	4192	“ Back to our house , yes . ”
310278	310288	310289	310289	Hudson	1556	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re calling me . ”
310335	310352	310322	310322	he	180	“ I wanted to hear your voice . Digital letters were n’t cutting it any longer . ”
310372	310379	310361	310361	His	180	“ I love hearing you too . ”
310396	310404	310361	310361	His	180	“ Did you sleep well last night ? ”
310405	310425	310361	310361	His	180	“ I did not . I ’ve slept horribly every night that I have n’t fallen asleep inside you . ”
310438	310444	310426	310426	I	884	“ So you ’re horny . ”
310445	310463	310361	310361	His	180	“ No , Alayna . If I were simply horny , I could take care of myself . ”
310473	310482	310483	310483	He	180	“ It has nothing to do with sex — ”
310486	310507	310483	310483	He	180	“ Well , it only has some to do with sex . It ’s connecting with you that I miss . ”
310515	310541	310511	310511	I	884	“ I get it . I feel the same . When you come back , we ’ll connect for hours , how does that sound ? ”
310559	310566	310567	310567	His	180	“ It sounds wonderful , precious . ”
310572	310580	310567	310567	His	180	“ But we still have to talk . ”
310581	310600	310601	310601	I	884	“ We ’ll talk . We can connect first and then talk . And then connect some more . ”
310622	310627	310628	310628	He	180	“ You ’re insatiable . ”
310636	310650	310628	310628	He	180	“ You forget that you may not want to connect after we talk . ”
310663	310686	310651	310651	I	884	“ Another reason to connect before . But I ’m not worried about it . Just your willingness to talk is enough . ”
310693	310708	310651	310651	I	884	“ Okay , not exactly enough , but it pleases me . A lot . ”
310741	310744	310745	310745	he	180	“ Hmm , ”
310855	310864	310849	310849	I	884	“ What are you thinking about , H ? ”
310865	310876	310841	310841	We	4222	“ You . Bent over the couch in my office . ”
310880	310887	310877	310877	I	884	“ No , you are n’t . ”
310888	310930	310849	310849	I	884	“ Actually , I am . The sounds you made … the way you looked at me … your eyes when I made you come … God , Alayna , do you have any idea how beautiful and sexy you are ? ”
310952	310966	310944	310944	he	4224	“ If I am , it ’s because you make me that way . ”
310967	311001	310944	310944	he	4224	“ That ’s a lie . I never want to hear you say that I ’m responsible for your beauty again . I ca n’t take an ounce of credit for your perfection . ”
311002	311026	310944	310944	he	4224	“ But you can take every ounce of credit for my happiness , and that ’s much more important to me than beauty . ”
311040	311047	311027	311027	He	4224	“ What is it , Hudson ? ”
311048	311075	310944	310944	he	4224	“ I was just wondering what I did to deserve the responsibility of your happiness . I hope that I can live up to the honor . ”
311148	311158	311159	311159	I	884	“ You deserve the honor just for loving me , ”
311163	311171	311172	311172	He	4224	“ And love you , I do . ”
311182	311188	311172	311172	He	4224	“ What are you wearing ? ”
311189	311197	311198	311198	I	884	“ Black lacy panties and a camisole . ”
311220	311234	311235	311235	I	884	“ I was just about to jump in the shower when you called . ”
311252	311258	311243	311243	Hudson	1556	“ Take off your panties . ”
311259	311274	311277	311277	I	884	“ Oh my god , Hudson , I do n’t have time for this . ”
311290	311297	311243	311243	Hudson	1556	“ You have to undress anyway . ”
311304	311332	311299	311302	a man of reason	4225	“ For that alone , they ’re off . And now I ’m getting off the phone . You ’re too distracting for me at the moment . ”
311342	311345	311348	311348	he	4224	“ Fine . ”
311351	311356	311348	311348	he	4224	“ I miss you . ”
311357	311366	311348	311348	he	4224	“ I miss you , I love you . ”
311367	311373	311348	311348	he	4224	“ I love you first . ”
311397	311403	311404	311404	I	884	“ I said it first , ”
311407	311414	311415	311415	he	4224	“ But I meant it first , ”
311420	311437	311415	311415	he	4224	“ Get in the shower . Do n’t touch yourself unless you ’re thinking of me . ”
311438	311450	311451	311451	My	884	“ Whom else would I think of , you silly man ? ”
311475	311508	311471	311471	I	884	“ I ’m letting you know now that I plan to text you throughout the night . Wicked , dirty things . You ’ll be desperate for me when you get back . ”
311509	311517	311518	311518	he	4224	“ I ’m desperate for you now , ”
311521	311536	311518	311518	he	4224	“ Go , before I make you touch yourself with me on the phone . ”
312390	312397	312383	312383	I	884	“ Words without experience are meaningless . ”
312686	312695	312696	312696	she	1124	“ By all means , Laynie , sit , ”
312745	312754	312728	312728	I	884	“ This is you , is n’t it ? ”
312767	312785	312755	312755	She	1124	“ I do n’t know for the life of me what you ’re talking about , Laynie . ”
312833	312857	312832	312832	I.	884	“ That email , Celia . You ’re the one who sent it to Stacy . I recognize your choice of literary quotes . ”
312858	312865	312866	312866	Her	1124	“ Why , that ’s crazy . ”
312871	312918	312866	312866	Her	1124	“ This says it ’s from Hudson . Did you hack into his email ? I hear that ’s typical of women with your condition . In fact , Laynie , should you really be sitting with me ? I could still file that restraining order . ”
312949	312964	312940	312940	we	4264	“ What I do n’t understand is how you got Hudson to go along . ”
312965	312971	312972	312972	She	1124	“ Go along with what ? ”
312976	312980	312981	312981	I	884	“ The kiss . ”
313003	313006	312994	312994	I	884	“ This . ”
313033	313042	313020	313020	she	1124	“ So you ’ve discovered our little secret . ”
313060	313068	313053	313053	I	884	“ That you played together ? Yes . ”
313072	313097	313069	313069	She	1124	“ Is that what he told you ? I suppose he would n’t want you to know what we really meant to each other . ”
313098	313108	313069	313069	She	1124	“ Ha ha . I do n’t buy it . ”
313109	313120	313121	313121	She	1124	“ That I was Hudson ’s lover ? Suit yourself . ”
313126	313163	313121	313121	She	1124	“ It lasted beyond that , you know . Why do you think I had a key to his place ? And when I picked him up at the Hamptons — there was no business trip . ”
313185	313204	313205	313205	I	884	“ You ’ve fucked with me too many times to believe anything that comes out of your mouth . ”
313230	313267	313227	313227	Celia	9246	“ I could give you proof , if I wanted to . I know all his bedroom moves . Does he dominate you completely ? Does he have a nickname for you ? Precious , perhaps ? ”
313302	313372	313297	313297	She	1124	“ He does , does n’t he ? Do n’t you know that he calls all his lovers precious ? Did you think it was just for you ? He called me that when he plowed into me over and over on his office desk . ‘ My precious , my precious , ’ he ’d say . I ’m sure he simply says it now out of habit . ”
313418	313434	313415	313415	I	884	“ Maybe it was n’t just for me . But this is just for you . ”
313470	313475	313476	313476	she	1124	“ You fucking bitch ! ”
313485	313504	313476	313476	she	1124	“ I was thinking the same about you . Though cunt would have been my choice of noun . ”
313514	313523	313510	313510	Celia	9246	“ You want a noun ? Try lawsuit . ”
314262	314290	314255	314255	Jordan	655	“ Hey , I know your shift does n’t start for a bit , but I ’m sort of in a situation and I need your help . ”
314291	314303	314255	314255	Jordan	655	“ I can be at the penthouse in twenty - five . ”
314316	314336	314304	314304	He	655	“ Actually , I ’m not there . I ’m just walking off the subway at Grand Central Station . ”
314347	314354	314344	314344	he	655	“ Reynold ’s not with you ? ”
314355	314358	314359	314359	I	884	“ No . ”
314371	314386	314359	314359	I	884	“ I ’ll explain when I see you . Can you come meet me ? ”
314387	314407	314344	314344	he	655	“ Yep . In fact , if you ’re at Grand Central , I can be there in ten . ”
314510	314516	314500	314500	Jordan	655	“ Have you called Hudson ? ”
314517	314525	314526	314526	I	884	“ I tried . I got voicemail . ”
314539	314619	314500	314500	Jordan	655	“ That ’s fine . It ’s really not urgent . Here ’s what ’s probably going to happen : Celia will likely have gone to the ER . Because of who she is and the pull she has , I ’d assume she ’d get the police to take her complaint there . With a simple one - swing hit , the cops will often forget the whole thing . They wo n’t because she ’s a Werner . ”
314620	314626	314720	314720	Jordan	655	“ Could I be arrested ? ”
314642	314687	314637	314637	He	884	“ They ’ll track you down and give you a court date . No warrants , no arrests . There will be plenty of time for Mr. Pierce to get the whole thing dropped — which he will . You know that , right ? ”
314688	314692	314693	314693	I	884	“ I do . ”
314701	314719	314693	314693	I	884	“ At least , I think I do . I also feel shitty about being a burden . ”
314742	314796	314730	314730	He	884	“ That man could never think of you as a burden , Laynie . He turned mountains over to get your last charge completely expunged . And the deal he ’s working on now has been much more problematic than it will be for him to get rid of any charge from Celia . ”
314818	314834	314809	314809	Jordan	655	“ What does the deal he ’s working on now have to do with me ? ”
314840	314872	314835	314835	He	655	“ I ’m sorry , Laynie . That ’s going to have to come from him . My point is that you ’re not his burden . You ’re his reason . ”
314904	314928	314892	314892	I	884	“ Thank you , Jordan . I appreciate that more than you can understand . Do you know when he ’ll be back ? ”
314946	314955	314937	314937	he	655	“ Depends on how his meetings go today . ”
315083	315123	315068	315068	I	884	“ The club is closed on Sundays , but we ’re having a party for my coworker who ’s going away . Do you think the police will show up there ? I do n’t want to ruin anything . ”
315124	315152	315188	315188	he	655	“ Nah . They ’ll either show up at the penthouse or wait until normal business hours to find you at work . You ’ll be fine . ”
315153	315170	315173	315173	I	884	“ I know I have to face them eventually , but I ’d rather not today . ”
315195	315232	315188	315188	he	655	“ Let ’s do this : we can take the train back uptown . I ’ll leave you at The Sky Launch — I do n’t expect Ms. Werner to show up and bother you tonight . ”
315233	315239	315242	315242	I	884	“ No . Not likely . ”
315266	315296	315297	315297	Jordan	655	“ The car is parked at the penthouse . I ’ll go and get it and come back to the club . Then we can leave whenever you want . ”
315337	315378	315332	315332	he	655	“ I bet that the police will stop by tomorrow morning , Laynie . If you prefer to stay away from them until Mr. Pierce gets back , I could take you to the loft tonight after the party instead . ”
315379	315392	315394	315394	I	884	“ That ’s not a bad idea . I ’ll consider it . ”
315680	315691	315692	315692	Liesl	166	“ Put the fucking phone down and boogie with me , ”
315736	315780	315781	315781	She	166	“ Laynie , I love you and I ’m here for you if you truly need me . But you seem to have moping down on your own so I ’m going to leave you to it and go have a good time . ”
315790	315794	315781	315781	She	166	“ Forgive me ? ”
315795	315805	315781	315781	She	166	“ Totally forgive you . Go . Have fun . ”
316000	316007	316028	316028	She	816	“ Mind if I join you ? ”
316038	316046	316028	316028	She	816	“ By all means , join me . ”
316104	316112	316096	316096	her	816	“ Why are n’t you out there ? ”
316160	316167	316168	316168	She	816	“ I ’m not really into … ”
316184	316187	316179	316179	I	884	“ Dancing ? ”
316188	316198	316199	316199	She	816	“ Actually , I was going to say people . ”
316204	316232	316199	316199	She	816	“ Besides , they ’re our employees . It does n’t seem right to party hard with them tonight when I might be writing them up tomorrow . ”
316241	316257	316235	316235	she	816	“ Gwen ? I ’m starting to like you . What ’s up with that ? ”
316262	316275	316258	316258	She	816	“ I ’m sure it wo n’t last . Give it time . ”
316432	316446	316427	316427	Gwen	816	“ You keep checking that thing . Are you expecting a better offer ? ”
316459	316487	316451	316451	I	884	“ Just waiting for Hudson to call . He ’s in L.A. for a couple of days . I had n’t realized I ’d been so obvious . ”
316491	316503	316488	316488	She	816	“ God , you ’re so lovesick , it ’s disgusting . ”
316509	316519	316504	316504	I	884	“ Do you not approve of me with Hudson ? ”
316523	316552	316553	316553	She	816	“ I do n’t give a flying fig about you and Hudson . It ’s love I do n’t approve of . I get it enough with Nor — ”
316566	316581	316553	316553	She	816	“ Anyway . Seems there ’s love all around . I ’m over it . ”
316650	316660	316648	316648	me	884	“ Ooh , Gwen ’s got a heartache story . ”
316684	316699	316674	316674	I	884	“ Is that why you were so eager to leave Eighty - Eighth Floor ? ”
316729	316744	316745	316745	She	816	“ Nice try . I ’m drunk , but I ’m not that drunk . ”
316764	316779	316745	316745	She	816	“ Speaking of which , why do n’t you join me on the intoxicatrain ? ”
316780	316787	316793	316793	I	884	“ Not much of a drinker . ”
316813	316816	316817	316817	She	816	“ Hmm . ”
316850	316867	316842	316842	She	816	“ I heard you saying something about addiction to Liesl . Are you a former alky ? ”
316909	316926	316890	316890	she	816	“ Uh - uh . Not happening . You have your secrets , I have mine . ”
316930	316937	316927	316927	Gwen	816	“ I ’m good with that . ”
316938	316947	316948	316948	David	180	“ So this is where the party is . ”
316960	316968	316969	316969	Gwen	816	“ Ha ha . Sarcasm . Nice . ”
316994	317025	316984	316984	David	180	“ This night is supposed to be my last chance with my favorite people . And my most favorite people is over here moping . What ’s up with that ? ”
317071	317098	317058	317058	he	180	“ Shit , I ’m sorry , David . This is supposed to be a party , and I ’m crashing it with my bad mood . ”
317118	317140	317099	317099	He	180	“ Why are you in a bad mood , anyway ? You were so … peppy … the last two days . ”
317147	317152	317141	317141	His	180	“ Trouble in paradise ? ”
317162	317176	317157	317157	he	180	“ I hate to disappoint you , but I do n’t think so . ”
317217	317229	317210	317210	I	884	“ There is the fact that I could be arrested soon . ”
317248	317255	317256	317256	she	816	“ Do n’t look at me , ”
317262	317271	317256	317256	she	816	“ She does n’t tell me jack shit . ”
317288	317297	317272	317272	He	180	“ I think I need to hear more . ”
317336	317360	317323	317325	a good friend	821	“ No , you really do n’t need to hear more . Forget I said anything . Please . I ’m being melodramatic . ”
317363	317373	317376	317376	David	180	“ Let me know if I can do anything ? ”
317503	317519	317497	317497	I	884	“ You know what you can do , David ? You can cheer me up . ”
317529	317537	317520	317520	I	884	“ Let ’s dance , shall we ? ”
317538	317546	317497	317497	I	884	“ I thought you ’d never ask . ”
317738	317745	317746	317746	He	180	“ Someone must have requested it . ”
317754	317764	317746	317746	He	180	“ Let ’s not waste it , shall we ? ”
318168	318176	318159	318159	he	180	“ I can not get you out . ”
318553	318556	318557	318557	I	884	“ Hudson . ”
318564	318573	318557	318557	I	884	“ It ’s not what it looks like . ”
318610	318622	318605	318605	His	180	“ Maybe we should discuss this in a more private setting . ”
318623	318626	318605	318605	His	180	“ Okay . ”
318768	318791	318765	318765	I	884	“ He kissed me , Hudson . I did n’t kiss him . And when he did , I pushed him away . ”
318811	318823	318824	318824	His	180	“ Why were you in his arms in the first place ? ”
318852	318862	318824	318824	His	180	“ We were dancing . It was a party . ”
318867	318900	318863	318863	His	180	“ You were in his arms , Alayna . In the arms of someone who has made no secret of his feelings for you . What did you think he ’d do ? ”
318959	318964	318965	318965	I	884	“ It was innocent , ”
318968	318982	318965	318965	I	884	“ I needed someone . He was here . And you were n’t . ”
319005	319018	319019	319019	He	180	“ Where were you today , anyway ? When I needed you ? ”
319026	319041	319019	319019	He	180	“ What was it you needed , Alayna ? Someone to keep you warm ? ”
319057	319061	319042	319042	I	884	“ That hurts . ”
319062	319069	319019	319019	He	180	“ What I just witnessed hurts . ”
319149	319158	319139	319139	he	180	“ Yeah , I know how it feels . ”
319159	319163	319111	319111	she	9246	“ Do you ? ”
319184	319240	319111	319111	she	9246	“ Yeah , I do . Let me see if I can explain it . It feels like your gut has been wrenched out of your body . At least that ’s what it felt like when Celia told me that you ’d been fucking her for most of the time we ’ve been together . ”
319241	319244	319245	319245	He	180	“ What ? ”
319300	319307	319272	319272	she	9246	“ When did she say that ? ”
319308	319311	319312	319312	I	884	“ Today , ”
319323	319329	319330	319330	His	180	“ You saw her today ? ”
319334	319349	319330	319330	His	180	“ Does this have something to do with the phone message she left me ? ”
319350	319358	319361	319361	she	9246	“ I knew she ’d call you ! ”
319371	319377	319367	319367	he	180	“ What did she say ? ”
319384	319412	319378	319378	He	180	“ She was raving nonsense . Something about you and her lawyer . I figured it was more of her shit from before so I deleted it . ”
319439	319464	319423	319423	his	180	“ What happened with her ? Was she following you again ? What did she do ? And why did n’t Reynold call me ? ”
319473	319479	319465	319465	I	884	“ He did n’t know . ”
319518	319570	319512	319512	his	180	“ Please do n’t look at me like that . I ’m sorry . I was stir - crazy so I grabbed my computer and went for coffee . I thought when I set the alarm to away that Reynold might notice , but I guess it did n’t inform him . ”
319576	319587	319571	319571	Hudson	1556	“ It only texts when you set it for home . ”
319629	319659	319620	319620	I	884	“ Anyway , I just went to the bakery down the street . And Celia showed up . And I was sick of it . So I approached her . ”
319660	319665	319669	319669	his	180	“ You approached her ? ”
319699	319781	319695	319695	he	180	“ I did . It was stupid . I know it was stupid . But Stacy had sent me one of the emails that you had supposedly sent her , and I was reading it , and I could tell it was n’t from you . I recognized one of the quotes used from one of the books Celia highlighted , and I knew the email was from her . So I confronted her about it . About writing the email . ”
319802	319820	319799	319799	he	180	“ And she told you then that I was with her ? Just out of the blue ? ”
319845	319855	319859	319859	his	180	“ First , I showed her Stacy ’s video . ”
319872	319907	319868	319868	I	884	“ Then she said that you were together . That you were a couple . That you fucked her that night and it was n’t the first time and it was n’t the last . ”
319924	319930	319909	319909	Hudson	1556	“ And you believed her ? ”
319936	319947	319931	319931	I	884	“ It pissed me off enough that I punched her . ”
319958	319963	319931	319931	I	884	“ You punched her ? ”
319979	319998	319975	319975	I	884	“ You know what ? Keep acting like this is an interrogation and I ’m out of here . ”
320037	320062	320027	320027	his	180	“ I ’m sorry if I sound a bit tense , Alayna . I assure you it ’s only out of concern for you . ”
320148	320184	320130	320130	I	884	“ Yes , I punched her . I think I broke her nose . So I ’m probably going to get some sort of assault charge for that . That ’s why I needed you . ”
320185	320188	320189	320189	His	180	“ Alayna . ”
320195	320203	320189	320189	His	180	“ Why did n’t you call me ? ”
320204	320248	320130	320130	I	884	“ I did ! Your phone was off . I could have left a message , but I did n’t want to say all that over voicemail , and I did n’t want to interrupt your meeting because I knew it was important . ”
320249	320256	320257	320257	He	180	“ Not as important as you . ”
320312	320319	320291	320291	he	180	“ Have the police contacted you ? ”
320325	320345	320320	320320	I	884	“ I was afraid to go back to the house so I came here to wait for your call . ”
320353	320394	320395	320395	He	180	“ I got your text when I was already in flight . I did n’t call because I knew I ’d end up telling you I was on my way home , and I wanted it to be a surprise . ”
320399	320411	320395	320395	He	180	“ I took a nap instead . I should have called . ”
320422	320430	320395	320395	He	180	“ I should have kept my cool . ”
320431	320457	320395	320395	He	180	“ I ’ll take care of everything . Do n’t worry about it in the least . She ’s not going to bother you again . ”
320547	320551	320538	320538	me	884	“ Thank you . ”
320598	320601	320602	320602	my	884	“ Hudson , ”
320606	320611	320602	320602	my	884	“ I ’m sorry . ”
320612	320627	320628	320628	He	180	“ Do n’t be . Good for you , actually . She deserves worse . ”
320655	320665	320648	320648	I	884	“ I mean , I ’m sorry about David . ”
320666	320669	320670	320670	His	180	“ Oh . ”
320691	320705	320681	320681	His	180	“ Tell me one thing — do you still feel anything for him ? ”
320706	320795	320831	320831	He	4338	“ No . No , I do n’t . Nothing . I ’ve told you that before , and I meant it , though I ’m sure it does n’t seem like it seeing me tonight . But the whole time he was holding me , it felt wrong . All I could think about was you . I was missing you , H. Needing you . So much . And I did n’t think about what I was doing . I ’m so , so , sor — ”
320839	320858	320831	320831	He	4338	“ I missed you too , precious . Needed you . I was trying to get back here — ”
320859	320866	320867	320867	I	884	“ And I ruined your surprise . ”
320874	320880	320867	320867	I	884	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
320881	320907	320831	320831	He	4338	“ I do n’t care . It hurts , but I ’ve hurt you . And as long as you swear that he means nothing — ”
320908	320925	320926	320926	I	884	“ Nothing . I swear with every fiber of my body , it ’s only you . ”
320937	320942	320926	320926	I	884	“ How about you — ”
320958	320967	320953	320953	I	884	“ Do you still feel anything for Celia ? ”
320983	320993	320979	320979	he	4338	“ Alayna … I’ve never felt anything for Celia . ”
320994	321003	321004	321004	They	4339	“ You mean , it was just sex ? ”
321026	321036	321020	321020	He	4338	“ I ’ve never been with her at all . ”
321037	321042	321020	321020	He	4338	“ She was lying . ”
321063	321068	321059	321059	He	4338	“ She was lying . ”
321069	321076	321059	321059	He	4338	“ That ’s what I thought . ”
321175	321190	321166	321166	I	884	“ But here ’s the thing — I sort of wish it were true . ”
321197	321266	321191	321191	He	4338	“ Not that you were sleeping with her while we were together — not that part . But the rest of it — that you were really with her when Stacy saw you . If that was the truth , I could accept it . Do n’t get me wrong — the idea of you with her , fucking her — it torments me . It really does . ”
321276	321302	321191	321191	He	4338	“ But I think I always knew you were never with her . It ’s in your eyes — both now and in that video . ”
321313	321324	321305	321305	Adam	700	“ I was n’t . I was never with her . ”
321349	321408	321339	321339	his	700	“ And that means that the thing with Stacy was a scam . Of course it was . I wanted to think it was just Celia in on it , and you were protecting her . But you said you were n’t and you did go along enough to stage that kiss . You were part of it . ”
321435	321515	321409	321409	I	884	“ I thought for a minute that might be your secret . Except it ’s not it . I mean , yeah , that ’s shitty that you did that to her , but I knew you had those things in your past . And you knew that I knew those things . If that were all there was to learn from that video , you would have told me . There had to be more you were hiding . ”
321529	321583	321522	321522	I	884	“ It ’s because of what night it was , the night of the symposium , is n’t it ? I considered that you did n’t want me to know that you were still manipulating people for fun that recently , but now I do n’t think that ’s all of it either . ”
321584	321587	321598	321598	his	4341	“ Alayna … ”
321661	321675	321676	321676	I	884	“ It ’s not the video itself . It ’s what happened after . ”
321745	321795	321726	321726	Hudson	1556	“ If Celia was there with you outside the symposium … then does n’t it make sense that she went in with you ? And if she went in with you , she was there when you first saw me . And if you were still playing people together … ”
321838	321846	321847	321847	he	4343	“ I was going to tell you , ”
321853	321861	321847	321847	he	4343	“ I came back to tell you . ”
321879	321888	321889	321889	He	4343	“ It ’s my worst mistake , Alayna . ”
321904	321975	321894	321894	his	4343	“ The most horrible of all the things I ’ve done . My biggest regret , although it ’s what gave me you and for that I ’m forever grateful . But I never knew what I ’d feel for you . I never knew that I could hurt you that much , and that I would care that I did . Please , Alayna , you have to understand . ”
321986	321997	321998	321998	I	884	“ That ’s what I was , was n’t I ? ”
322005	322014	321998	321998	I	884	“ A game . Your game . Together . ”
322026	322036	321998	321998	I	884	“ Oh god . Oh god , oh god . ”
322037	322040	322041	322041	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna — ”
322060	322066	322051	322051	I	884	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
322134	322175	322120	322120	Hudson	1556	“ It was n’t what you think , Alayna . Yes , it started as a game . As Celia ’s game . But I only went along because it was you . Because I was so enamored with you . ”
322288	322294	322269	322269	he	884	“ Alayna , let me — ”
322308	322316	322317	322317	I	884	“ I do n’t want your help , ”
322339	322345	322331	322331	I	884	“ I want fucking answers . ”
322346	322358	322359	322359	His	884	“ Anything . I told you I ’d tell you anything . ”
322423	322430	322405	322405	I	884	“ You were enamored with me ? ”
322439	322448	322405	322405	I	884	“ So you decided to fuck with me ? ”
322449	322452	322453	322453	He	884	“ No . ”
322467	322484	322453	322453	He	884	“ No , I wanted to get near you , and her plan was an excuse . ”
322485	322509	322405	322405	I	884	“ And what was her plan ? ‘ That girl presenting now . Make her fall in love with you and’ … what ? ”
322518	322534	322510	322510	He	884	“ No , it did n’t happen like that . It was n’t like that . ”
322543	322553	322535	322535	I	884	“ Then what was it like ? Tell me ! ”
322577	322607	322561	322561	I	884	“ I saw you , like I ’ve told you , and I was drawn to you . Completely drawn to you . I ’ve never lied about that . ”
322608	322619	322554	322554	He	884	“ Drawn to me so you decided to destroy me . ”
322643	322663	322637	322637	Hudson	1556	“ This is n’t how I wanted to tell you . It ’s not coming out right at all . ”
322664	322684	322685	322685	I	884	“ You mean if you told it another way , you could manipulate it to make it sound better . ”
322710	322723	322698	322698	He	884	“ I deserve that . But that ’s not what I meant . ”
322741	322771	322698	322698	He	884	“ Let me tell it the way it was . Please . It wo n’t be better . It will still be awful , but it will be accurate . ”
322793	322798	322772	322772	I	884	“ I ’m waiting . ”
322807	322837	322799	322799	He	884	“ I saw you . And Celia noticed , I think . Noticed me noticing you . A few days later , she showed up with information about you . ”
322838	322845	322846	322846	My	884	“ She showed up with information ? ”
322878	322910	322934	322934	her	9246	“ Yes , Celia had investigated you . It was n’t me . She had your police record and the restraining order , plus a copy of your mental health record . ”
322960	323014	322946	322946	He	884	“ It was in complete opposition to what I ’d seen of you , Alayna . Everything she ’d gathered — that was n’t the strong , confident woman we ’d seen at the symposium . It was obvious those things existed in your past . You were better . I saw that . ”
323015	323020	323021	323021	I	884	“ I was better . ”
323037	323041	323021	323021	I	884	“ I was . ”
323042	323052	323053	323053	He	884	“ Yes . You were . It was evident . ”
323058	323072	323053	323053	He	884	“ Her theory , though , was that you could be broken again . ”
323077	323083	323053	323053	He	884	“ I did n’t agree . ”
323172	323225	323161	323161	He	884	“ That was the bet . She made up the whole idea to have you break up our nonexistent engagement . After a time , I was to end things with you , naturally . Say that the farce was no longer necessary . Then we ’d wait and see what happened . ”
323233	323241	323226	323226	He	884	“ But I did n’t ever feel — ”
323247	323265	323242	323242	I	884	“ So all of it was a scam . Every single part of us was a lie . ”
323283	323286	323287	323287	He	884	“ No ! ”
323293	323342	323287	323287	He	884	“ Even in the beginning , it was never about the game . Not for me . I was n’t supposed to seduce you . I was n’t supposed to fall in love with you . And I did both before you ’d even agreed to play along . ”
323360	323389	323343	323343	I	884	“ But you did n’t fall in love with me . There ’s no way , because you do n’t do shit like that to people you love ! ”
323390	323427	323428	323428	His	884	“ I ’d never been in love , Alayna ! I did n’t understand what I was feeling . I only knew I had to be with you and this was the way to do it . ”
323432	323459	323428	323428	His	884	“ I ’m not excusing what I did , but I ’m explaining . I ’m pleading for you to try to … to try and … ”
323460	323475	323428	323428	His	884	“ And what ? See it from your point of view ? Forgive you ? ”
323522	323537	323515	323515	I	884	“ This is unforgiveable , Hudson ! There is no moving forward from this . ”
323538	323550	323551	323551	His	884	“ Do n’t say that . Do n’t ever say that . ”
323601	323635	323594	323594	I	884	“ What is it exactly that you do n’t want to hear , Hudson ? That I ca n’t forgive you ? I ca n’t . I ca n’t forgive this . Ever . ”
323636	323641	323642	323642	He	884	“ Alayna , please ! ”
323663	323689	323648	323648	I	884	“ We ’re over . Over ! Do n’t you get it ? There ’s no fucking way to ever trust you again after this ! ”
323799	323818	323792	323792	I	884	“ I ’m leaving now . Do n’t try to stop me . Do n’t come after me . ”
323832	323837	323792	323792	I	884	“ We ’re done . ”
323843	323865	323838	323838	Hudson	1556	“ We are n’t done , Alayna . This is n’t over . We ’ve rebuilt trust after you ’ve broken — ”
323871	323916	323866	323866	I	884	“ Do n’t even fucking compare what I ’ve done to this ! My mistakes are not even in the same category . This is the worst thing . The worst thing you could ... I ca n’t even … I ca n’t breathe … ”
323957	323961	323952	323952	I	884	“ Do n’t , ”
323971	324010	323952	323952	I	884	“ Do n’t ever again . Do n’t touch me . Do n’t call . Do n’t try to reach out to me . This is over , Hudson . Over ! I ca n’t see you anymore . ”
324073	324090	324091	324091	Hudson	1556	“ Do n’t say that , Alayna . Tell me how to fix this . Please . ”
324098	324111	324091	324091	Hudson	1556	“ I ’ll do anything . There has to be a way . ”
324123	324142	324112	324112	I	884	“ How ? Tell me how there could possibly be a way to go on together after this ? ”
324160	324185	324186	324186	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t have all the answers yet . But we can work on it together . We fix each other , remember ? ”
324201	324218	324186	324186	Hudson	1556	“ I love you , Alayna . I love you — that has to mean something . ”
324257	324265	324249	324249	I	884	“ Right now it really does n’t . ”
324266	324275	324276	324276	He	4348	“ Please . You ca n’t mean that . ”
324299	324307	324293	324293	I	884	“ Get your fucking hands off me ! ”
324335	324339	324340	324340	he	4348	“ You said , ”
324343	324353	324340	324340	he	4348	“ you said you could love me through anything … ”
324379	324405	324369	324369	I	884	“ Since everything you said turned out to be a lie , I do n’t feel like I ’m obligated to honor my promise either . ”
324515	324522	324509	324509	David	180	“ Are you okay , Laynie ? ”
324563	324571	324551	324551	I	884	“ No . I ’m not okay . ”
324590	324593	324585	324585	Hudson	1556	“ Alayna … ”
324647	324652	324642	324642	he	180	“ I ’ll leave . ”
324658	324678	324653	324653	Hudson	1556	“ I ’m sorry to put a damper on your party . Thank you for looking out for her . ”
324880	324886	324887	324887	David	180	“ What can I do ? ”
324904	324910	324894	324894	I	884	“ Get Liesl , please . ”
325659	325710	325648	325648	His	8755	“ I will be saying and doing things — romantic things , perhaps — that are not genuine . I need you to remember that . Out of the public eye , I will seduce you . That will be genuine , but it can never be misconstrued as love . ”
325867	325871	325872	325872	I	884	“ The club … ”
325886	325895	325877	325877	She	166	“ I already called in sick for you . ”
326022	326036	326012	326012	I	884	“ Do you have something I can wear if I take a shower ? ”
326041	326049	326037	326037	She	166	“ Anything in my closet ’s yours . ”
326182	326190	326191	326191	she	4375	“ My bed is yours , babe , ”
326219	326256	326214	326214	I	884	“ I already feel bad about overtaking your place . Besides , I need to start trying to function a little bit on my own . Even if that only means being in my own bed . ”
326257	326261	326262	326262	She	4375	“ Suit yourself . ”
326271	326283	326262	326262	She	4375	“ And you ’re welcome here as long as you want . ”
326297	326317	326284	326284	I	884	“ I think it ’s going to be a while , Liesl . Are you sure about the offer ? ”
326318	326321	326262	326262	She	4375	“ Yep . ”
326467	326476	326463	326463	I	884	“ Have the police been looking for me ? ”
326508	326517	326498	326498	Liesl	166	“ Nope , and they wo n’t be . ”
326524	326550	326518	326518	She	166	“ Hudson called me on my cell yesterday morning . He wanted me to tell you that he ’d gotten the whole battery charge dismissed . ”
326606	326613	326601	326601	I	884	“ Did he say anything else ? ”
326614	326633	326595	326595	I	884	“ He said lots of things . I decided you were n’t interested in hearing any of it . ”
326634	326642	326643	326643	I	884	“ Good thinking . I was n’t . ”
326650	326661	326643	326643	I	884	“ But I am now . What did he say ? ”
326662	326728	326595	326595	I	884	“ That he wanted to give you your space , but that he ’s anxious to talk to you when — if — you want to . That he ’ll do anything you want him to for the club , even if that includes doing nothing . That you ’re welcome to come back to the penthouse — he ’s staying at his other place . ”
326729	326733	326643	326643	I	884	“ The loft . ”
326773	326779	326780	326780	She	4385	“ Yeah , the loft . ”
326785	326797	326780	326780	She	4385	“ He also insisted that I tell you he loves you . ”
326798	326807	326780	326780	She	4385	“ I do n’t want to hear that . ”
326881	326889	326878	326878	Liesl	166	“ That ’s what I told him . ”
326898	326910	326878	326878	Liesl	166	“ He said it did n’t make it any less true . ”
326998	327005	327006	327006	Gwen	816	“ I told you it sucks , ”
327021	327025	327016	327016	I	884	“ What sucks ? ”
327059	327078	327049	327049	Gwen	816	“ Love , darling . L - o - v - e , love . Worst thing ever . ”
327090	327097	327080	327080	my	884	“ Yeah . It really does . ”
327159	327189	327146	327146	Liesl	166	“ You need a distraction . A release . Like maybe you should pet the pussy . I could loan you my vibrator while I ’m at work tonight . ”
327193	327199	327190	327190	I	884	“ Um , no thanks . ”
327200	327230	327190	327190	I	884	“ Then we could drive to Atlantic City this weekend and check out David ’s new place . You know he ’d fuck your brains out if you asked . ”
327231	327245	327190	327190	I	884	“ First of all , David does n’t fuck anyone ’s brains out . ”
327273	327289	327290	327290	Hudson	1556	“ Secondly , I do n’t ever want to have sex with anyone ever again . ”
327422	327440	327414	327414	I	884	“ Speaking of the weekend — can I borrow your phone ? I need to call Mira . ”
327537	327545	327513	327513	she	8319	“ Mirabelle ’s . This is Mira . ”
327553	327558	327513	327513	she	8319	“ Hey , Mira . ”
327559	327562	327563	327563	she	8319	“ Laynie ! ”
327573	327623	327563	327563	she	8319	“ I was going to call you and check in . Great minds . I have your dress altered and ready for you — do you want to pick it up before Saturday or change here that day ? Or I could have it sent to you by courier . ”
327663	327668	327669	327669	I	884	“ I … Mira … ”
327684	327701	327677	327677	I	884	“ I ca n’t do your event . I ’m sorry . I called to cancel . ”
327708	327717	327677	327677	I	884	“ Hudson and I … we broke up . ”
327742	327746	327747	327747	she	8319	“ I know , ”
327758	327812	327752	327752	she	8319	“ Which is why I banned him from the store on Saturday . I do n’t give a shit if he makes it to my event . But you — Laynie , I have to have you here . Please say you ’ll still come . It would mean so much to me . ”
327834	327839	327840	327840	I	884	“ Mira , no , ”
327843	327861	327840	327840	I	884	“ That ’s not right . You ca n’t keep your own brother from your special day . ”
327862	327868	327869	327869	she	4395	“ Yes , I can , ”
327872	327889	327869	327869	she	4395	“ He does n’t care about fashion . He does care about me . And you . ”
327915	327934	327901	327901	I	884	“ Please , do n’t say that . I do n’t want to hear about his supposed emotions . ”
327935	328040	327901	327901	I	884	“ Okay , okay . That ’s fine . I was n’t trying to meddle . I was simply trying to tell you that he already offered to not come before I banned him . He said he wanted me and you to be happy and so he was bowing out . Yes , I ’d rather have you both there . Of course I would . But if it comes to you or him , I definitely choose you . You ’re one of my models , and more importantly , you ’re my friend . You ’re like a sister , Laynie . ”
328144	328153	328155	328155	I	884	“ All right . I ’ll do it . ”
328162	328188	328155	328155	I	884	“ But you better swear to god that he will not be there . And this better not be a trick to get us together . ”
328189	328203	328204	328204	She	8319	“ I swear he will not be there . Swear on my baby . ”
328207	328218	328204	328204	She	8319	“ Though that tricking you to get you together idea ... ”
328219	328222	328155	328155	I	884	“ Mira — ”
328223	328229	328230	328230	Her	8319	“ I ’m just kidding . ”
328238	328246	328230	328230	Her	8319	“ Yay ! Thank you , Laynie . ”
328247	328252	328235	328235	her	8319	“ You ’re welcome . ”
328256	328265	328235	328235	her	8319	“ But do n’t expect a cheery model . ”
328266	328283	328284	328284	She	8319	“ You can do the serious / somber thing . I ’m totes okay with that . ”
328289	328331	328284	328284	She	8319	“ And for the record , I do n’t know what that fucker did to mess things up with the two of you , but he ’s a miserable wreck about it . I mean , completely and utterly broken up . ”
328396	328416	328388	328388	I	884	“ Mira , if you ’re going to keep telling me about him , I ’m going to cancel . ”
328417	328425	328426	328426	She	4402	“ No ! Do n’t do that . ”
328430	328444	328426	328426	She	4402	“ Just had to get that out there . I ’m done now . ”
328445	328452	328485	328485	I	884	“ Okay , but no more . ”
328462	328470	328485	328485	I	884	“ I ’ll change there on Saturday . ”
328474	328484	328471	328471	She	4402	“ I ’m so excited ! See you then . ”
328493	328500	328501	328501	Liesl	166	“ Well , look at that , ”
328510	328519	328501	328501	Liesl	166	“ You have some color in your cheeks . ”
328520	328526	328527	328527	I	884	“ It ’s not possible . ”
328629	328641	328619	328619	I	884	“ I , um , I want to go to work . ”
328647	328652	328642	328642	Liesl	166	“ Are you sure ? ”
328660	328701	328642	328642	Liesl	166	“ Not tonight . But tomorrow , yeah . I need to see if I can be there . I do n’t think I can make a good decision about my future at the club without trying a shift out . ”
329062	329064	329066	329067	Katy Perry	430	“ Roar ”
329097	329100	329102	329103	Phillip Phillips	387	“ So Easy ”
329113	329120	329121	329121	he	387	“ You make it so easy … ”
329449	329459	329460	329460	Liesl	166	“ Do you want me to go with you ? ”
329469	329480	329481	329481	I	884	“ No . I need to do this by myself . ”
329491	329541	329481	329481	I	884	“ I ’ll need you for the next time — when I get all my stuff . But this time , I ’m just going to run in and pack a bag to get me through a few days . It ’ll feel good to finally wear panties again . ”
329552	329564	329542	329542	I	884	“ Shit . I only have my heels from the party . ”
329565	329573	329613	329613	She	166	“ I ’ll loan you some shoes . ”
329574	329584	329585	329585	Liesl	166	“ We do n’t have the same size feet . ”
329624	329641	329613	329613	She	166	“ You can wear these . They ’re like one - size - fits - many . ”
329642	329645	329646	329646	I	884	“ Fine . ”
329657	329668	329653	329653	They	4415	“ Okay . I ’m off . Wish me luck . ”
329669	329680	329681	329681	She	166	“ You do n’t need luck . You got this . ”
329689	329699	329681	329681	She	166	“ You ’re sure he wo n’t be there ? ”
329700	329703	329704	329704	I	884	“ Positive . ”
331509	331519	331520	331520	I	884	“ I have n’t been here in a while . ”
331542	331557	331558	331559	Celia Werner	9246	“ I ’d forgotten what a good job I ’d done with the place . ”
331715	331730	331731	331731	she	9246	“ Remember how I had to convince you to go with the leather couch ? ”
331753	331765	331766	331766	Hudson	1556	“ We ’re not here for a walk down memory lane . ”
331776	331782	331772	331772	Her	9246	“ Why are we here ? ”
331800	331819	331766	331766	Hudson	1556	“ Because we have some things to talk about , and they are n’t suitable for my office . ”
331820	331842	331843	331843	Her	9246	“ Then I ca n’t help but think of old times . Other conversations that were n’t appropriate for your office . ”
331883	331899	331875	331875	Hudson	1556	“ If you want to relive those times , then do it on your own . ”
332018	332024	332025	332025	Her	9246	“ Come on , Huds . ”
332038	332049	332025	332025	Her	9246	“ You act like we never had any fun together . ”
332050	332059	332061	332061	he	884	“ That was a lifetime ago , Celia . ”
332073	332081	332061	332061	he	884	“ It ’s time to move on . ”
332085	332090	332082	332082	Celia	9246	“ Because of her ? ”
332091	332096	332104	332104	Jesus	680	“ Who ? Alayna ? ”
332129	332135	332136	332136	He	680	“ Yes . And no . ”
332139	332146	332136	332136	He	680	“ We are n’t together anymore . ”
332185	332193	332178	332178	Celia	9246	“ Am I supposed to be sad ? ”
332194	332210	332211	332211	He	680	“ Why would I expect that ? That was your intended outcome , after all . ”
332298	332301	332302	332302	Celia	9246	“ No , ”
332305	332330	332302	332302	Celia	9246	“ my intended outcome was that she ’d go crazy after your break - up and end up back in her psycho obsession mode . ”
332337	332352	332302	332302	Celia	9246	“ Well , that ’s not happening . She ’s stronger than you thought . ”
332425	332442	332415	332415	Celia	9246	“ Maybe . I ’m not sure I agree . How long ago was this breakup ? ”
332443	332449	332491	332491	she	9246	“ A few days now . ”
332450	332483	332415	332415	Celia	9246	“ Oh , give it time . She ’ll be back . That girl was head over heels for you . She ’s not walking away that easily . Not that type . ”
332546	332552	332553	332553	Hudson	1556	“ Celia , stop it . ”
332561	332577	332553	332553	Hudson	1556	“ Are you still sticking to the story that you ’re in love with her ? ”
332628	332664	332616	332616	his	4468	“ That ’s ridiculous , Hudson . You ’ve never loved anyone . It ’s not in your nature . You ’re fascinated with her for some godforsaken reason . But it ’s not love . ”
332665	332673	332674	332674	He	4468	“ What do you know about love ? ”
332688	332716	332684	332684	She	9246	“ Everything you taught me — it ’s a fleeting emotion that can be manipulated and fabricated . It ’s not real . It ’s never real . ”
332717	332734	332684	332684	She	9246	“ It ’s time you found another teacher . I no longer believe any of that . ”
332827	332838	332839	332839	Celia	9246	“ Maybe I should be the teacher for a while , ”
332842	332853	332839	332839	Celia	9246	“ It ’s time to change up the game anyway . ”
332876	332887	332862	332862	Hudson	1556	“ I do n’t want to play anymore , Celia . ”
332888	332903	332862	332862	Hudson	1556	“ You said that before with Stacy . And you ended up coming around . ”
332904	332964	332862	332862	Hudson	1556	“ That was all your game . I gave you a make - out session . That ’s all . And it was n’t for you , it was for her . I do n’t know the extent you played with her , but it was time you were done . I knew that the kiss would end it . ”
332965	332979	332862	332862	Hudson	1556	“ Are you trying to convince me you had feelings for Stacy too ? ”
332980	333021	332862	332862	Hudson	1556	“ You were using my name to fuck with my sister ’s assistant . It was going to come back and bite me in the ass eventually . And she was a nice girl . She did n’t deserve it . ”
333052	333066	333049	333049	he	4471	“ Those are the only reasons I resorted to helping you with that . ”
333172	333196	333169	333169	her	8674	“ And why did you agree to the Alayna game ? Do n’t tell me that was an excuse to be with her . ”
333207	333229	333204	333204	she	8674	“ Liar . You ’re you . Hudson Pierce . You would have found a way to be with her anyway . ”
333230	333256	333204	333204	she	8674	“ The minute I showed her any interest , you did too . Going along with your game was the only way to protect her . ”
333257	333260	333261	333261	Celia	9246	“ Whatever , ”
333266	333310	333261	333261	Celia	9246	“ If it ’s true that your interest was what attracted me , then the way for you to protect her would have been to run from her . Far and fast . I do n’t buy it . You wanted to play . ”
333337	333359	333330	333330	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re right . I should have run . I could n’t . So I did the next best thing . ”
333433	333445	333446	333446	he	4476	“ I did n’t want to play the game with her , ”
333450	333461	333446	333446	he	4476	“ And I do n’t want to play ever again . ”
333494	333503	333504	333504	Celia	9246	“ You do n’t mean that , Hudson . ”
333549	333556	333557	333557	she	9246	“ Remember what it ’s like ? ”
333561	333598	333557	333557	she	9246	“ The adrenaline rush ? To stage a situation , knowing exactly how it will play out because you studied the characters so well you understand what they ’ll do . There ’s nothing like it . ”
333599	333607	333632	333632	Their	4477	“ You ’re destroying people ’s lives ! ”
333608	333613	333557	333557	she	9246	“ You taught me ! ”
333614	333631	333632	333632	Their	4477	“ Then learn this next lesson well — it was wrong . I. Was . Wrong . ”
333720	333776	333713	333713	Hudson	1556	“ And of all the lives I ’ve destroyed , Celia , I ’m most regretful for what I ’ve done to yours . But I ca n’t be responsible for that anymore . You have to decide now who you ’re going to be . This is not who I ’m going to be . ”
333835	333841	333842	333842	Celia	9246	“ Then you ’re out , ”
333847	333867	333842	333842	Celia	9246	“ That ’s fine . I ’m not . And I ’m not done with the Alayna Withers experiment . ”
333904	333914	333915	333915	He	884	“ Oh yes , you are done with Alayna . ”
333928	333962	333915	333915	He	884	“ And do n’t give me the line that you play to win . I can think of some times that you ’ve lost . You ’ve lost big , if I recall . ”
333963	333968	333969	333969	She	1556	“ That ’s cruel . ”
333983	333999	334000	334000	His	884	“ Ah , but is n’t that one of the requirements to playing the game ? ”
334034	334042	334043	334043	Hudson	1556	“ Tell me , I ’m curious , ”
334047	334103	334043	334043	Hudson	1556	“ what exactly was your plan with Alayna , anyway ? After I dropped out and refused to break up with her , you created your befriend - and - frame scheme . When that failed , then what ? The books with the quotes , the stalking — what was that supposed to do ? ”
334111	334132	334104	334104	I	884	“ I do n’t know . Push her over the edge . Make her doubt you . Drive you apart . ”
334136	334154	334133	334133	Hudson	1556	“ It seemed like random flailing to me . Guesswork . That ’s not how we played . ”
334155	334169	334133	334133	Hudson	1556	“ It worked , did n’t it ? You ’re not together anymore . ”
334216	334232	334205	334205	He	4482	“ Believe it or not , that has nothing to do with anything you did . ”
334233	334261	334205	334205	He	4482	“ Really ? I thought for sure telling her we were lovers had been the final nail in the coffin . Especially when I gave her proof . ”
334262	334275	334205	334205	He	4482	“ What proof could you possibly give for something that never happened ? ”
334322	334343	334368	334368	Her	4484	“ I told her you called me the same pet name you called her . Tore . Her . Up . ”
334344	334358	334368	334368	Her	4484	“ From the looks of it , it seems she tore you up . ”
334359	334363	334364	334364	she	4484	“ Battle scars , ”
334389	334400	334368	334368	Her	4484	“ What pet name are you talking about , anyway ? ”
334426	334429	334430	334430	she	4484	“ Precious , ”
334433	334443	334444	334444	He	4482	“ How the hell did you know about that ? ”
334485	334513	334466	334466	his	4482	“ I borrowed her phone one day when we ’d had lunch . I saw text messages between the two of you . You called her precious . ”
334557	334587	334554	334554	Celia	9246	“ Oh , come on . It was a good play . A fucking good play . And you ’re telling me that had no bearing on your breakup ? ”
334588	334601	334540	334540	Hudson	1556	“ No . I think she could have survived that , honestly . ”
334610	334620	334540	334540	Hudson	1556	“ It was the truth that did us in . ”
334621	334630	334554	334554	Celia	9246	“ The truth ? You told her — ? ”
334636	334639	334631	334631	He	4482	“ Everything . ”
334640	334647	334540	334540	Hudson	1556	“ That ’s against the ru — ”
334654	334685	334686	334686	He	4482	“ There are no fucking rules anymore , Celia . It ’s over ! I ’m not playing . And I ’m not discussing Alayna with you for another minute . ”
334740	334757	334759	334759	she	9246	“ Is that why you brought me here ? To tell me that you ’re quitting ? ”
334774	334790	334791	334791	Hudson	1556	“ I have n’t even really played in years . Except to be your pawn . ”
334803	334834	334791	334791	Hudson	1556	“ But no , that ’s not why you ’re here . I ’m telling you that you ’re quitting . You ’re done , Celia . No more games . ”
334835	334850	334800	334800	his	4482	“ You ’re joking , right ? You ca n’t decide that for me . ”
334892	334909	334910	334910	Hudson	1556	“ You ’re right that I ca n’t monitor you in every facet of your life , ”
334913	334945	334910	334910	Hudson	1556	“ nor do I have any intention , but I can tell you that you will not be messing with me or my family or my employees and definitely not Alayna . ”
335015	335065	335002	335002	Celia	9246	“ That ’s hilarious that you think you have any control over me in any measure . And your declaration is only begging for me to prove you wrong . Plus , even though I agreed to not press charges , I ’m not finished with this Alayna game . ”
335066	335073	335076	335076	he	884	“ You are finished , Celia . ”
335081	335123	335076	335076	he	884	“ While I ’d hoped you ’d give it up for the sake of our friendship — or whatever it is that we once had — I had a feeling that you ’d disagree . So I ’ve attained some insurance . ”
335124	335129	335002	335002	Celia	9246	“ I ’m intrigued . ”
335133	335146	335132	335132	I.	884	“ Let me tell you about a company that I just bought . ”
335156	335166	335132	335132	I.	884	“ Actually , I ’ll show you the paperwork . ”
335400	335406	335407	335407	she	4488	“ How did you … ? ”
335410	335414	335415	335415	He	4489	“ Very sneakily . ”
335431	335474	335415	335415	He	4489	“ I ’ll admit , it was n’t easy . I had to convince another company to purchase a portion of the stock , and then I bought out that company — you do n’t really want the details , do you ? ”
335490	335497	335498	335498	he	4489	“ The contracts are signed now , ”
335501	335519	335498	335498	he	4489	“ That ’s all that matters . I ’m officially the majority owner of Werner Media Corporation . ”
335584	335595	335596	335596	Celia	9246	“ And you said you ’d quit playing the game . ”
335604	335613	335614	335614	he	4489	“ I had one final move to make , ”
335671	335680	335681	335681	she	9246	“ It ’s checkmate , is it then ? ”
335684	335689	335690	335690	Triumph	437	“ You tell me . ”
335699	335708	335709	335709	She	9246	“ What are your plans for Werner Media ? ”
335751	335799	335800	335800	He	4489	“ At the moment , I have no plans . The company ’s doing well as it is . Warren Werner is definitely the right man to be in charge . However , if there were any reason that I felt his presence was no longer needed … ”
335807	335813	335814	335814	Celia	9246	“ He ’d be devastated , ”
335818	335863	335814	335814	Celia	9246	“ I imagine he ’d be devastated just to learn he no longer holds controlling interest . For now , the fact is still hidden . He has no idea that he ’s no longer in charge . Would you like that to change ? ”
335864	335867	335868	335868	she	9246	“ No , ”
335871	335889	335814	335814	Celia	9246	“ Do you plan on doing anything that might cause me to alter my current business plan ? ”
335900	335903	335890	335890	Defeat	438	“ No . ”
335904	335912	335814	335814	Celia	9246	“ Then yes , it ’s checkmate . ”
336039	336050	336051	336051	Celia	9246	“ I guess it ’s time for me to go , ”
336055	336065	336051	336051	Celia	9246	“ It is . I ’ll walk you out . ”
336297	336302	336303	336303	he	4500	“ Hold the elevator , ”
336366	336369	336370	336370	I	884	“ Hey , ”
336373	336383	336370	336370	I	884	“ I had the curtains shut for a reason . ”
336384	336393	336394	336394	Liesl	166	“ Too bad . You got your fashionything . ”
336407	336411	336394	336394	Liesl	166	“ Get up . ”
336412	336422	336423	336423	I	884	“ But , Mom , I do n’t wanna . ”
336459	336466	336443	336443	I	884	“ Why are you awake anyway ? ”
336518	336528	336529	336529	She	166	“ Got a ride from one of the regulars . ”
336534	336549	336529	336529	She	166	“ And when I say ride , I do n’t mean in a car . ”
336652	336661	336647	336647	She	166	“ Are you going to be okay today ? ”
336668	336682	336662	336662	I	884	“ Hudson ’s not supposed to be at the show . So yeah . ”
336753	336772	336740	336740	Liesl	166	“ What ’s that frown about then ? You ’re wishing he was coming , are n’t you ? ”
336778	336784	336774	336774	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
336817	336831	336809	336809	I	884	“ Why do you think he has n’t tried to talk to me ? ”
336832	336840	336809	336809	I	884	“ Maybe he ’s respecting your space . ”
336864	336875	336856	336856	I	884	“ Hudson ’s never been one to respect my space . ”
336905	336928	336895	336895	he	4506	“ I guess I thought he ’d fight for me . Especially after what he did yesterday . After he saw me . ”
336934	336941	336929	336929	Liesl	166	“ Wanna hear what I think ? ”
336942	336958	336929	336929	Liesl	166	“ Probably not , but I ’m sure you ’re going to tell me anyway . ”
336959	336963	336964	336964	She	166	“ I am . ”
336971	337000	336964	336964	She	166	“ I think that it ’s probably still too soon to figure out whether he ’s going to fight for you or whether you even want him to . ”
337001	337011	337013	337013	I	884	“ I do n’t want him fighting for me . ”
337025	337033	337018	337018	She	166	“ Uh - uh . Too soon . ”
337102	337149	337093	337093	She	166	“ I ’m proud of you though . You made it through this week . And through work last night . And you ’re going to his sister ’s thingamabob . And you only had one obsessive breakdown . I think you ’ve done pretty good . ”
337197	337202	337192	337192	I	884	“ I miss him . ”
337211	337222	337203	337203	Liesl	166	“ I know . That might get worse before better . ”
337223	337226	337192	337192	I	884	“ Yeah . ”
337309	337317	337303	337303	He	700	“ Laynie , good to see you . ”
337338	337396	337415	337415	Adam	700	“ I ’m so glad you ’re here . Please , get Mira to stop running around , will you ? She needs to sit and put her feet up . I swear to god , after today , if she does n’t start taking it easy , I ’m going to chain her to the bed . ”
337397	337404	337405	337405	I	884	“ That sounds a little personal , ”
337408	337414	337405	337405	I	884	“ Where is she now ? ”
337441	337446	337447	337447	she	8319	“ You ’re here ! ”
337472	337485	337465	337465	her	8319	“ I was afraid you ’d bow out at the last minute . ”
337497	337514	337486	337486	I	884	“ Nope . I ’m here . Do you have time to give me a tour ? ”
337536	337546	337547	337547	I	884	“ Or would you prefer I get dressed first ? ”
337557	337567	337547	337547	I	884	“ Get dressed first and then it ’s on . ”
337783	337811	337812	337812	She	8319	“ Oh my god , you ’re so beautiful ! You are definitely going to be the finale . Dammit , I wish Hudson could see you . ”
337825	337847	337812	337812	She	8319	“ Sorry . It slipped out . It ’s going to take a while to get used to the new situation . ”
337848	337855	337856	337856	I	884	“ Yeah , I get that . ”
337869	337884	337862	337862	She	8319	“ Let me show you my baby . Well , one of my babies . ”
337918	337941	337942	337942	Mira	8319	“ The stage is where we ’ll do today ’s show . In the future it will be for private fashion selection , ”
337949	337975	337942	337942	Mira	8319	“ Some of these rich bitches are too lazy to try on their own clothes so we have models hired to do it for them . ”
338021	338026	338027	338027	I	884	“ Speaking of Sophia , ”
338035	338045	338027	338027	I	884	“ where is she ? Is n’t she coming ? ”
338046	338051	338052	338052	She	8319	“ Um , no . ”
338064	338072	338052	338052	She	8319	“ I banned her along with Hudson . ”
338073	338076	338083	338083	Sophia	1858	“ What ? ”
338129	338140	338121	338121	Mira	8319	“ I took your advice . We staged an intervention . ”
338141	338149	338150	338150	I	884	“ Oh , my god , Mira ! ”
338168	338199	338160	338160	She	8319	“ It was hard , but Hudson and Chandler and Adam and even Dad were there . We all sat her down and told her she needed to get help . ”
338216	338222	338211	338211	I	884	“ When did this happen ? ”
338230	338293	338211	338211	I	884	“ Last night . She did n’t want to hear it , of course . But when I told her she could n’t be a part of my life anymore if she did n’t get help , then she agreed . She checked into a long - term facility upstate this morning . Hudson , Dad , and Chandler drove her out . ”
338294	338297	338298	338298	My	884	“ Wow . ”
338325	338357	338358	338358	I	884	“ You know , I ’ve never seen my mother sober — she might still be a bitch . But at least I could trust her not to drop my baby . ”
338426	338429	338420	338420	She	4530	“ What ? ”
338430	338467	338420	338420	She	4530	“ I ’m just really amazed by you . That ’s hard to stand up like that for someone you love and today you have your event … how are you dealing with all of this ? ”
338468	338481	338484	338484	her	4530	“ Honestly , except for being tired , I feel really good . ”
338491	338506	338484	338484	her	4530	“ The only thing I ’m worrying about now is you and my brother . ”
338515	338527	338507	338507	I	884	“ I ’m miserable enough without the guilt trip , thanks . ”
338544	338554	338507	338507	I	884	“ He told us what he did to you . ”
338564	338567	338555	338555	My	884	“ What ? ”
338568	338633	338634	338634	Her	4530	“ During mom ’s intervention . He said that if we had any hope of being a family , then we needed to face our flaws and own up to our mistakes . He went back to therapy this week , and I think his doctor encouraged him to be open with us . So he owned up to what he did to you . ”
338641	338675	338634	338634	Her	4530	“ I ’m sorry he did that to you , Laynie . Really sorry . I ’m not going to defend him . But I will say that he is full of regret . ”
338676	338680	338681	338681	My	884	“ I ’m … ”
338685	338696	338681	338681	My	884	“ Dammit , Mira , you ’re making me cry . ”
338703	338737	338697	338697	She	4530	“ Do n’t cry ! Then I ’ll cry and that will be a disaster . No more serious talk , except to say I love you . Thank you for being here . ”
338738	338748	338634	338634	Her	4530	“ I would n’t miss it for the world . ”
339874	339877	339878	339878	he	4562	“ Hey , ”
339989	340007	339970	339970	I	884	“ You ’re not supposed to be here , Hudson . Mira promised you would n’t be . ”
340013	340023	340008	340008	He	4562	“ Mira had nothing to do with me coming . ”
340044	340053	340035	340035	I	884	“ Were n’t you taking Sophia to rehab ? ”
340099	340107	340108	340108	He	4562	“ Already done . I hurried back . ”
340116	340124	340108	340108	He	4562	“ So I could talk to you . ”
340188	340205	340177	340177	him	4562	“ If you wanted to talk to me so badly , why did you leave yesterday ? ”
340206	340242	340243	340243	He	4562	“ I had to be at my parents ’ for the intervention . If I stayed , I would n’t have been able to leave . It was hard enough to leave as it was . ”
340248	340263	340243	340243	He	4562	“ And I thought perhaps it was best to let you have your space . ”
340295	340302	340287	340287	I	884	“ But you ’re here now . ”
340312	340321	340287	340287	I	884	“ How is that letting me have space ? ”
340373	340381	340386	340386	he	4562	“ I could n’t stay away anymore . ”
340403	340411	340386	340386	he	4562	“ Why were you at the loft ? ”
340419	340431	340412	340412	I	884	“ Because I ’m weaker than you give me credit for . ”
340452	340469	340444	340444	he	4562	“ I was hoping it was n’t weakness , but a sign that you still cared . ”
340486	340509	340482	340482	I	884	“ Of course I still care , you asshole . I ’m in love with you . You shattered my fucking heart . ”
340518	340526	340510	340510	His	4562	“ Alayna , let me fix it . ”
340527	340532	340482	340482	I	884	“ You ca n’t . ”
340533	340538	340510	340510	His	4562	“ Let me try . ”
340539	340542	340482	340482	I	884	“ How ? ”
340556	340595	340482	340482	I	884	“ Even if I can figure out how to forgive you , I ca n’t trust you again . I could never believe that you were with me for any reason other than to continue your sick game . ”
340601	340611	340596	340596	He	4562	“ I quit all that . You heard me . ”
340615	340635	340612	340612	I	884	“ Maybe it was all a set - up . Maybe you knew I was there the whole time . ”
340671	340678	340679	340679	I	884	“ You do n’t believe that . ”
340691	340705	340679	340679	I	884	“ It ’s hard to believe anything after being so totally lied to . ”
340706	340711	340712	340712	he	4562	“ For the record , ”
340721	340742	340712	340712	he	4562	“ I did n’t lie to you about us . Everything I ever said and did with you was honest . ”
340743	340759	340679	340679	I	884	“ The whole circumstance of our pretend to be my girlfriend sham was a lie . ”
340760	340838	340839	340839	His	4562	“ Yes , but that ’s all . Every touch , every kiss , every moment between you and me , precious … none of that was pretend . I did n’t want to pretend with you . I wanted every experience with you , every moment to be completely genuine . You ’re the first person I have ever let in , the first person who ’s ever seen the real me through all the bullshit . ”
340846	340868	340839	340839	His	4562	“ You ’re the first person I ’ve ever loved , Alayna . And I know you ’ll be the last . ”
340901	340907	340908	340908	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
340916	340947	340908	340908	I	884	“ I do n’t know , I do n’t know . I do n’t know how I can ever believe that you really feel the way you say you do . ”
340955	340978	340948	340948	He	4562	“ I ’m sure that ’s true . But I thought of a way to prove that I ’m devoted to you . ”
340993	340999	340948	340948	He	4562	“ Alayna , marry me . ”
341005	341008	341000	341000	My	884	“ What ? ”
341009	341044	341000	341000	My	884	“ Marry me . Right now . My plane ’s already ready and waiting on the tarmac . All you have to do is say yes and we ’re on our way to Vegas . ”
341045	341048	341049	341049	I	884	“ What ? ”
341060	341093	341000	341000	My	884	“ I know you deserve a long engagement and a proper wedding — and we can do that again , whenever you want — but I know right now you need reassurance . ”
341118	341168	341000	341000	My	884	“ You need confirmation that I am committed to you , Alayna , and there ’s no better way I can think of showing you that than to marry you . To declare in a written contract that I ’m yours and that I promise to love you forever . ”
341174	341181	341169	341169	I	884	“ Hudson , you ’re crazy . ”
341182	341188	341189	341189	He	884	“ And no prenup either . ”
341205	341232	341201	341201	I	884	“ I ’m ready to give you everything I have , to make myself vulnerable , just like you made yourself to me time after time . ”
341233	341245	341247	341247	I	884	“ No prenup ? Now I definitely know you ’re crazy . ”
341256	341268	341269	341269	He	884	“ I am crazy . Crazy without you in my life . ”
341277	341379	341269	341269	He	884	“ You ’re the only one who ’s ever made me better . And you have me by the balls now , Alayna , in so many ways . Because if you say no , if you turn me away , then I ’ve lost everything that means anything in my pathetic excuse for a life . But if you say yes , I have to be the one to trust you — you could scam me if you wanted to . You could simply marry me now , divorce me later and half of all I have would be yours . ”
341389	341397	341382	341382	his	4575	“ I have no interest in your — ”
341403	341427	341428	341428	He	4575	“ I know . I know that you would never take advantage of me like that . But the point is you could . ”
341434	341462	341463	341463	He	4575	“ This is the only way I can think of to show you that I ’m willing to be vulnerable to you . That I trust you . ”
341470	341503	341463	341463	He	4575	“ And that , even though I do n’t deserve it , I ’m determined to fight to earn back your trust . Even if it takes the rest of my life . ”
341544	341561	341538	341538	I	884	“ Some romantic proposal — marry me so that I can prove you can trust me . ”
341562	341567	341568	341568	his	4575	“ No , Alayna , ”
341572	341585	341586	341586	He	4575	“ Marry me because I love you . More than life itself . ”
341592	341605	341586	341586	He	4575	“ Marry me today , so I can prove I mean it . ”
341606	341613	341614	341614	He	4575	“ Hudson , this is insane . ”
341622	341647	341614	341614	He	4575	“ You destroyed everything we had together . You ca n’t just fix it by asking me to marry you out of the blue . ”
341648	341652	341653	341653	He	4575	“ Why not ? ”
341668	341672	341653	341653	He	4575	“ Why not ? ”
341684	341711	341712	341712	He	4575	“ We belong together . For all the wrongs we ’ve done — I’ve done — you ca n’t deny that we make each other better . ”
341720	341776	341712	341712	He	4575	“ You admit you love me . And I love you . What ’s keeping us apart ? The fact that we hurt each other ? Can you honestly say that you feel less hurt without me around ? You came by the loft , Alayna . I know you ’re still thinking about me . ”
341788	341825	341777	341777	He	4575	“ The only logical reason you can give for not being with me is that you do n’t trust that I ’m really in it for love . Marry me and you ’ll have no doubt . ”
341840	341846	341830	341830	he	4575	“ Please , marry me . ”
342094	342097	342083	342083	He	4575	“ No . ”
342098	342101	342102	342102	His	4575	“ No ? ”
342132	342135	342136	342136	I	884	“ No , ”
342139	342142	342143	342143	I	884	“ No . ”
342146	342186	342143	342143	I	884	“ You think you can fix everything between us by asking me to elope with you ? It ’s hard for me to even look at you right now . Why would you think I would consider marrying you ? ”
342204	342310	342187	342187	He	4575	“ Do n’t talk . I do n’t want an answer . I need to say some things . Yes , I came to the loft because I missed you . Missed you desperately . But if I ’d had any inkling you ’d be there , I would have found a way to resist . I ’m glad I was there because I found out some things that I needed to know . I ’m grateful for what you did . But it does n’t change you and me . It just makes it easier for me to maybe one day find some closure . ”
342311	342319	342320	342320	He	4579	“ Do n’t say closure , Alay — ”
342330	342336	342320	342320	He	4579	“ Sorry . Go on . ”
342393	342443	342385	342385	I	884	“ Even if I could trust you , Hudson , I would n’t want to marry a guy just because he scammed me and now he feels bad . And not in Vegas . I ’d want my brother and Mira and Adam and Jack . And even Sophia . ”
342449	342470	342444	342444	His	4579	“ You want my family at your wedding ? Does that mean I have a shot at being the groom ? ”
342471	342480	342444	342444	His	4579	“ Once , you did . But now … ”
342489	342497	342444	342444	His	4579	“ Now I ca n’t see how . ”
342647	342656	342645	342645	him	4579	“ I have to leave now , Hudson . ”
342664	342700	342657	342657	He	4579	“ Alayna , let ’s talk about this more . If not this plan , maybe we can talk about something else . Or no plan at all . Just talking to you is nice . ”
342701	342711	342712	342712	I	884	“ I ca n’t . I need to go . ”
342716	342719	342657	342657	He	4579	“ Alayna … ”
342720	342723	342724	342724	my	884	“ Please , ”
342728	342733	342724	342724	my	884	“ let me go . ”
342784	342795	342764	342764	He	4579	“ No , I ’m not ever letting you go . ”
342803	342856	342764	342764	He	4579	“ I ’ll let you leave here right now , but I ’m not giving up on you . I ’ll pursue you like I ’ve never pursued anything in my life . I ’ll fight until you have no choice but to believe that I love you with everything I am . ”
342958	342961	342953	342953	I	884	“ Hudson , ”
342974	342979	342962	342962	I	884	“ Let me go . ”
343035	343053	343030	343030	he	4579	“ I ’m never giving up , Alayna . I ’ll prove myself . You ’ll see . ”
343078	343083	343084	343084	I	884	“ What ’s this ? ”
343088	343107	343108	343108	She	816	“ Beats me . A courier left it for you about half an hour ago . No message . ”
343301	343314	343287	343287	Gwen	816	“ Ah , so lover boy ’s trying to win you back . ”
343315	343318	343319	343319	I	884	“ Supposedly . ”
343340	343347	343348	343348	she	816	“ There could be worse things , ”
343416	343428	343411	343411	I	884	“ How does he know I ’m sleeping on a futon ? ”
343432	343443	343429	343429	She	816	“ Maybe I said something in one of our texts . ”
343444	343450	343453	343453	she	816	“ You ’re texting him ? ”
343461	343507	343508	343508	She	816	“ He had your phone charger delivered the other night to the club . Guess he figured that ’s why you had n’t been responding to him . So I plugged it in and holy Jesus , Laynie , that thing was filled with texts . ”
343517	343536	343508	343508	She	816	“ Some of them made me feel a little bad for the guy . I texted him back . ”
343547	343552	343537	343537	I	884	“ What the fuck ? ”
343553	343564	343584	343584	she	816	“ I told him it was me and not you . ”
343575	343582	343537	343537	I	884	“ That ’s private , Liesl . ”
343587	343601	343602	343602	She	816	“ Someone should be reading them . That ’s all I ’m saying . ”
343628	343643	343620	343620	She	816	“ It ’s plugged in on top of the fridge if you ’re interested . ”
344173	344186	344168	344168	Liesl	166	“ Did you see the suit at the end of the bar ? ”
344187	344190	344191	344191	I	884	“ No , ”
344216	344224	344213	344213	She	166	“ Well , check him out then . ”
344353	344360	344361	344361	he	4596	“ The service here is excellent , ”
344526	344529	344530	344531	a waitress	4601	“ Order ! ”
344550	344556	344557	344557	Silly	1556	“ I have to go . ”
344568	344581	344561	344561	I	884	“ Um , will you be wanting another when you ’ve finished ? ”
344582	344604	344605	344605	His	4596	“ No , just the one . But I might sit here for a while , if you do n’t mind . ”
344612	344618	344605	344605	His	4596	“ The view is stunning . ”
344657	344664	344651	344651	she	166	“ This is from the suit . ”
344695	344709	344681	344681	Poughkeepsie	3	“ Liesl , I ’ll , um , I ’ll be right back . ”
344734	344737	344738	344738	I	884	“ Hudson ! ”
344769	344795	344761	344761	I	884	“ I ca n’t accept this . I ’m in charge here . I ca n’t leave for a week to go to a spa . ”
344815	344826	344802	344802	we	4603	“ Unless you ’d rather I was n’t working here . ”
344827	344834	344835	344835	His	4596	“ Do n’t ever think that . ”
344842	344863	344864	344864	He	4596	“ If you think you ca n’t work with me as your owner , I ’ll give you the club . ”
344882	344894	344878	344878	I	884	“ I just want to keep my job , thank you . ”
344898	344909	344895	344895	He	4596	“ It ’s yours as long as you want it . ”
344923	344944	344910	344910	He	4596	“ And the certificate — keep it . You can use it anytime you want . There ’s no expiration . ”
344986	344991	344973	344973	I	884	“ Fine . Whatever . ”
345014	345020	345021	345021	I	884	“ There ’s another thing . ”
345036	345047	345031	345031	I	884	“ I need to get my stuff from the penthouse . ”
345052	345061	345048	345048	His	4596	“ I wish you would n’t do that . ”
345091	345104	345080	345080	I	884	“ I want to come get the rest of my things Monday . ”
345105	345121	345085	345085	they	4605	“ I can have it packed and moved for you , if you ’d like . ”
345122	345130	345132	345132	he	4596	“ I ’d rather pack it myself . ”
345213	345222	345223	345223	His	4596	“ At least let me arrange a truck . ”
345245	345253	345241	345241	I	884	“ Okay . You can do that . ”
345274	345279	345280	345280	His	4596	“ It ’s done . ”
345288	345302	345280	345280	His	4596	“ This does n’t mean I ’m done trying to win you back . ”
345303	345315	345317	345317	I	884	“ I did n’t think for a second that it did . ”
345341	345353	345333	345333	Hudson	1556	“ You say that as if you almost enjoy my groveling . ”
345378	345394	345368	345368	I	884	“ I could n’t say , H. I have n’t really seen you grovel yet . ”
345419	345437	345438	345438	Liesl	166	“ He ’s , like , recalling your entire relationship with this stuff , is n’t he ? ”
345453	345466	345443	345443	I	884	“ I hate to say it , but he ’s kinda good . ”
345483	345487	345467	345467	I	884	“ Shut up . ”
345488	345494	345443	345443	I	884	“ What ’s this one ? ”
345495	345502	345503	345503	I	884	“ I do n’t know yet . ”
345616	345621	345622	345622	I	884	“ All of Me , ”
345627	345637	345622	345622	I	884	“ I do n’t know it . Do you ? ”
345638	345650	345651	345651	She	4612	“ Never heard of it . Let ’s stick it in . ”
345658	345665	345651	345651	She	4612	“ That ’s what she said . ”
345775	345779	345772	345772	he	4326	“ all of me ”
345781	345785	345772	345772	he	4326	“ all of you ”
345932	345941	345942	345942	I	884	“ Liesl , I do n’t care anymore , ”
345948	345997	345942	345942	I	884	“ Even if I should n’t be with him , I ca n’t live without him . He makes me feel better about me . I do n’t care anymore about what he did in the past . I only care that he ’s around in my future . ”
346005	346028	345998	345998	She	166	“ No one ’s telling you what you should or should n’t do here . Either way , you got my support . ”
346029	346044	346045	346045	I	884	“ Good , because I think I ’m going to give him another chance . ”
346123	346131	346132	346132	she	166	“ Maybe I could join you later , ”
346152	346161	346162	346162	I	884	“ But I need you the whole time , ”
346165	346168	346162	346162	I	884	“ Please ? ”
346208	346231	346233	346233	Liesl	166	“ There ’s a beautiful Keurig inside . Best coffee ever . I ’ll make you as many mugs as you want . ”
346241	346244	346233	346233	Liesl	166	“ Fine . ”
346390	346396	346374	346374	I	884	“ Are n’t you coming ? ”
346397	346400	346401	346401	her	166	“ Uh … ”
346424	346430	346431	346431	she	166	“ Do n’t hate me ! ”
346718	346724	346728	346728	he	676	“ Those are new books . ”
346803	346818	346792	346792	He	676	“ They ’re for you . To replace the ones that had been damaged . ”
346819	346822	346823	346823	I	884	“ Oh , ”
346830	346835	346792	346792	He	676	“ What is it ? ”
346836	346845	346846	346846	I	884	“ I have nowhere to put all these . ”
346901	346915	346897	346897	he	676	“ I ’ll keep them for as long as you want me to . ”
346916	346920	346921	346921	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
346986	346996	346978	346978	he	676	“ I did n’t expect you to be here . ”
347004	347014	346978	346978	he	676	“ You did n’t say I could n’t be . ”
347015	347020	347021	347021	I	884	“ It was implied , ”
347031	347043	347024	347024	He	676	“ You do n’t seem that horribly pissed to see me . ”
347170	347175	347203	347203	he	676	“ Where is everything ? ”
347181	347189	347176	347176	His	676	“ Your stuff is still all here . ”
347190	347197	347203	347203	he	676	“ But where ’s your stuff ? ”
347217	347228	347203	347203	he	676	“ I ca n’t live here without you , Alayna . ”
347229	347236	347237	347237	I	884	“ So you ’re moving out ? ”
347333	347343	347322	347322	his	676	“ Actually , I hope I ’m moving in . ”
347370	347392	347358	347358	I	884	“ H , you confuse me enough without you trying to be confusing . Could you say something I can understand ? ”
347393	347398	347399	347399	His	676	“ I confuse you ? ”
347405	347411	347358	347358	I	884	“ Is this a surprise ? ”
347415	347422	347423	347423	I	884	“ So you ’re moving in ? ”
347450	347457	347458	347458	He	676	“ One day . I hope . ”
347472	347484	347458	347458	He	676	“ But for now , I want you to live here . ”
347485	347488	347458	347458	He	676	“ What ? ”
347537	347548	347549	347549	His	676	“ I ca n’t live here without you , precious . ”
347563	347626	347557	347557	I	884	“ But I do n’t want to sell it , because I love being here with you . Someday , you and I will be here again . While I ’m waiting for you — scratch that — while I ’m groveling for your forgiveness , it ’s a shame to let it sit empty . You and Liesl should move in . ”
347627	347635	347636	347636	My	884	“ I ca n’t accept that , H. ”
347655	347665	347666	347666	He	676	“ I had a feeling you ’d say that . ”
347678	347686	347666	347666	He	676	“ Then it will have to sit . ”
347703	347710	347687	347687	I	884	“ You could rent it out . ”
347715	347724	347711	347711	His	676	“ I could rent it out to you . ”
347728	347744	347725	347725	I	884	“ Best rent in town — only cost you a weekly dinner with the landlord . ”
347745	347749	347750	347750	I	884	“ Stop it . ”
347755	347765	347725	347725	I	884	“ Biweekly then . I ’m not above bargaining . ”
347766	347769	347770	347770	He	676	“ Hudson . ”
347791	347808	347809	347809	He	676	“ Fine , monthly . I ’ll take whatever scraps you ’re willing to give me . ”
347813	347826	347809	347809	He	676	“ You ’re considering giving me scraps now , are n’t you ? ”
347827	347830	347833	347833	he	676	“ Maybe . ”
347868	347885	347863	347863	I	884	“ Seriously , though , where ’s all your stuff ? Did you get another place ? ”
347901	347911	347896	347896	He	676	“ I gave it all to a charity fundraiser . ”
347912	347920	347922	347922	I	884	“ Lifestyles of the rich and famous . ”
347967	347977	347978	347978	He	676	“ I was n’t attached to any of it . ”
347992	348013	348014	348014	He	676	“ This entire apartment was perfectly designed to my tastes and style , but it never felt like a home . ”
348022	348083	348014	348014	He	676	“ Not until you , Alayna . You made it come alive . The things that were here — they were chosen for me by someone I want completely removed from my life . Right now , the things here are the only things that made this house a place I ’d want to live . Your things . You . ”
348084	348087	348088	348088	My	884	“ I … ”
348096	348117	348088	348088	My	884	“ And when I move back in , we can refurnish this place from scratch . Together . You and I. ”
348125	348139	348118	348118	I	884	“ You ’re so sure that one day I ’ll take you back . ”
348148	348153	348154	348154	He	884	“ I ’m hopeful . ”
348158	348169	348154	348154	He	884	“ Would you like to see how hopeful I am ? ”
348170	348173	348177	348177	I	884	“ Sure . ”
348226	348231	348213	348213	Hudson	1556	“ I bought this . ”
348381	348387	348388	348388	Hudson	1556	“ There ’s an inscription , ”
348444	348456	348457	348457	he	884	“ I realized something about the last time I asked this , ”
348470	348555	348457	348457	he	884	“ I did it wrong . First , I did n’t have a ring , and second , I should have gotten on one knee . But more importantly , I did n’t give you the right thing . I offered you everything I had , thinking that was the way to win your heart . That was n’t what you wanted at all . The only thing you ever asked for , the only thing I would never give you , was me . ”
348577	348583	348584	348584	Hudson	1556	“ But now I do . ”
348593	348639	348584	348584	Hudson	1556	“ Here I am , precious . I give myself freely . All of me , Alayna . No more walls or secrets or games or lies . I give you all of me , honestly . For forever , if you ’ll take it . ”
348884	348891	348892	348892	He	884	“ Alayna , I love you . ”
348919	348949	348892	348892	He	884	“ Will you marry me ? Not today , and not in Vegas , but in a church if you like , or at Mabel Shores in the Hamptons — ”
348956	348968	348951	348951	I	884	“ Or the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens during the cherry blossom season ? ”
348969	348974	348975	348975	His	884	“ Yes , there . ”
348979	348984	348975	348975	His	884	“ Is that a — ”
348985	348988	348989	348989	I	884	“ Yes , ”
348992	348998	348989	348989	I	884	“ It ’s a yes . ”
349015	349020	348999	348999	Hudson	1556	“ Say it again . ”
349021	349024	349025	349025	I	884	“ Yes , ”
349035	349043	349025	349025	I	884	“ Yes , I ’ll marry you . ”
349388	349394	349395	349395	I	884	“ You left the mattress ? ”
349412	349436	349406	349406	His	884	“ I picked it out myself . Besides , I could n’t bear to part with it . It has too many memories . ”
349488	349497	349498	349498	I	884	“ Are you sure you were n’t simply — ”
349508	349518	349502	349502	he	884	“ — being prepared for me to say yes ? ”
349525	349536	349537	349537	he	884	“ There may have been a little bit of that , ”
349556	349567	349537	349537	he	884	“ You know me so well , do n’t you ? ”
349582	349590	349568	349568	He	884	“ I want to know you better . ”
349598	349617	349591	349591	He	884	“ I want to know you better right now . God , I ’ve missed your gorgeous body . ”
349735	349740	349725	349725	I	884	“ I remember this . ”
349741	349753	349754	349754	He	884	“ Uh - uh . First we ’re focusing on you . ”
349774	349780	349783	349783	him	884	“ But I like this . ”
349786	349795	349783	349783	him	884	“ There should definitely be some of this . ”
349796	349808	349809	349809	He	884	“ Oh , there will be a whole lot of this . ”
349899	349963	349981	349981	He	884	“ Jesus , Alayna . You ’re so wet . Do you know how hard that makes me ? You ’re so wet and juicy that I ’m tempted to lick you clean . But I ’m anxious and missing you and I need my cock inside you as soon as possible . Tasting you will have to wait until the next round . ”
349964	349968	349969	349969	I	884	“ Next round ? ”
350017	350036	350070	350070	he	884	“ You ’re so turned on — you’re going to come fast , are n’t you , precious ? ”
350098	350120	350086	350086	Hudson	1556	“ Good girl . You ’re so fucking sexy when you come . It makes me so hard my cock throbs . ”
350149	350175	350134	350134	Hudson	1556	“ Remember our first night in the Hamptons ? When I made love to you so many times that you were sore the next day ? ”
350176	350182	350183	350183	I	884	“ How could I forget ? ”
350266	350358	350253	350253	Hudson	1556	“ That night is going to pale in comparison to today , precious . Today , I ’m going to make love to you sweetly and tenderly . Then I ’m going to fuck you so long and hard , your beautiful pussy is going to be raw . You wo n’t be able to stand , let alone walk . After that , I ’m going to go down on you until you ’re shivering and coming all over my tongue . And then we ’ll do it all again . ”
350368	350376	350359	350359	My	884	“ You ’re such a big talker . ”
350377	350387	350388	350388	he	884	“ I sure hope that was n’t a challenge , ”
350396	350405	350388	350388	he	884	“ Because if it was , game on . ”
350443	350446	350454	350454	him	884	“ Hurry . ”
350456	350462	350454	350454	him	884	“ I want you inside . ”
350481	350497	350463	350463	He	884	“ Patience , precious . We have time , and I need to feel you . ”
350577	350585	350586	350586	He	884	“ You feel so good , precious . ”
350603	350614	350586	350586	He	884	“ Rough , gentle — how do you want me ? ”
350615	350623	350624	350624	I	884	“ You ’re giving me a say ? ”
350639	350643	350630	350630	His	884	“ This time . ”
350665	350673	350662	350662	he	884	“ You decide . I trust you . ”
350738	350751	350725	350725	he	884	“ I love you , Alayna . My precious . My love . ”
350947	350955	350956	350956	Alayna	8844	“ Without struggle there is no progress , ”
351778	351794	351795	351795	she	1120	“ We would never have found each other if it were n’t for your game , ”
352359	352364	352365	352365	she	8844	“ Hey , handsome , ”
352379	352388	352365	352365	she	8844	“ It ’s time for the first dance . ”
352498	352510	352490	352490	I	884	“ What will our first dance be to , Mrs. Pierce ? ”
352636	352642	352643	352643	She	8844	“ Patience , Mr. Pierce . ”
352781	352796	352771	352771	I	884	“ It ’s a beautiful wedding , Alayna . You did an excellent job . ”
352809	352825	352797	352797	I	884	“ Thank you . I had a lot of help , thanks to your money . ”
352826	352830	352831	352831	I	884	“ Our money , ”
352875	352879	352880	352880	she	8844	“ Our money , ”
352883	352893	352880	352880	she	8844	“ And it ’s going well , I think . ”
352894	352898	352880	352880	she	8844	“ Very well . ”
352904	352919	352880	352880	she	8844	“ Did you notice Chandler ’s been following Gwen around like a lost puppy ? ”
352941	352949	352950	352950	Gwen	816	“ She does n’t seem to mind . ”
352965	352972	352973	352973	Alayna	8844	“ No , she does n’t . ”
352983	352989	352976	352976	She	8844	“ And everyone seems happy . ”
352990	352996	352998	352998	I	884	“ Everyone does at that . ”
353018	353028	353003	353003	She	8844	“ Even your mother has managed to remain polite . ”
353038	353054	353055	353055	Sophia	1858	“ She does seem slightly more in control of herself now that she ’s sober . ”
353102	353117	353094	353094	Sophia	1858	“ She still is a nasty old bitch , though , is n’t she ? ”
353139	353147	353118	353118	Alayna	8844	“ You said it , not me . ”
353219	353236	353237	353239	Arin Marise Sitkin	443	“ I saw you with Arin Marise , earlier . You ’re so good with her . ”
353459	353463	353464	353464	I	884	“ Do you … ”
353470	353480	353464	353464	I	884	“ Have you thought about children of your own ? ”
353499	353507	353481	353481	She	226	“ I ’d probably fuck them up . ”
353541	353552	353531	353531	I	884	“ Would you like to fuck them up with me ? ”
353569	353572	353573	353573	she	226	“ Yes , ”
353583	353589	353573	353573	she	226	“ I ’d love to . ”
353590	353593	353594	353594	I	884	“ Good . ”
353603	353650	353594	353594	I	884	“ We can get started tonight in the plane . Or right now , if you prefer . I saw a rather large oak in one of the smaller gardens . I ’m almost certain we could hide there , even with this dress of yours . ”
353651	353672	353573	353573	she	226	“ I ’d love to see how you plan to get at me with all this material in the way . ”
353679	353704	353673	353673	I	884	“ Oh , precious , I ’m very resourceful . Need I remind you that I ’m a man who gets what he wants ? ”
353715	353746	353706	353706	I	884	“ And anyone who ever doubted that only needs to look at me right now to know it ’s true . Everything I want is here , in my arms . ”
353747	353752	353753	353753	she	226	“ I love you , ”
353756	353762	353753	353753	she	226	“ I love you first . ”
353870	353874	353875	353875	He	4711	“ Mr. Pierce ! ”
353889	353909	353875	353875	He	4711	“ I did n’t expect it would be you representing Pierce Industries . I thought you ’d send someone . ”
353925	353928	353929	353929	God	8844	“ Surprise . ”
354168	354183	354161	354161	I	884	“ What are you still doing here ? I gave you what you wanted . ”
354184	354196	354198	354198	she	4719	“ I ’m already here . I thought I ’d stay . ”
354243	354249	354230	354230	I	884	“ You were n’t invited . ”
354265	354278	354279	354279	She	4719	“ You could invite me . We rarely see each other anymore . ”
354284	354289	354279	354279	She	4719	“ I miss you . ”
354406	354413	354414	354414	I	884	“ Fine ; you ’re invited , ”
354430	354449	354414	354414	I	884	“ I do n’t know why you want to be here . These things are boring as hell . ”
354531	354557	354513	354513	She	9246	“ If it ’s boring , why do you even come ? You could send someone who ’s twenty rungs down the ladder from you . ”
354876	354886	354866	354866	Celia	9246	“ You never know what gems you might find . ”
354904	354934	354901	354901	I	884	“ Do n’t blame me , though , when you have to fight to stay awake . And do n’t even think of trying to get me to leave . ”
354935	354949	354957	354957	she	9246	“ I wo n’t do either . I ’ll be a good girl . ”
355080	355092	355093	355093	she	442	“ I ’m only here to be with you , anyway , ”
355119	355128	355104	355104	I	884	“ Stop saying things like that , Celia . ”
355310	355315	355316	355316	she	442	“ I ’m sorry , ”
355323	355332	355316	355316	she	442	“ I just … I do n’t know . ”
355340	355351	355316	355316	she	442	“ You do n’t have to explain . I understand . ”
355630	355637	355622	355622	I	884	“ I ’m ready to go , ”
355802	355805	355806	355806	Celia	9246	“ What ? ”
355834	355840	355841	355841	Our	4760	“ Nothing . Never mind . ”
356154	356158	356159	356159	Celia	9246	“ Alayna Withers , ”
356166	356169	356170	356170	I	884	“ What ? ”
356193	356200	356187	356187	She	9246	“ Her name is Alayna Withers . ”
356325	356331	356332	356332	I	884	“ Your serve is terrible , ”
356397	356411	356387	356387	she	1120	“ My serve is fine . I ’m winning , are n’t I ? ”
356439	356458	356426	356426	I	884	“ Only because I ’m paying more attention to your god - awful posture than to the ball . ”
356464	356475	356476	356476	She	1120	“ That ’s your problem . You ’re easily distracted . ”
356503	356515	356489	356489	she	1120	“ Oh , hey . I did n’t see you there . ”
356614	356621	356622	356622	she	9246	“ I was enjoying your game , ”
356636	356643	356622	356622	she	9246	“ Hope you do n’t mind . ”
356644	356661	356662	356662	Mirabelle	1120	“ Yeah , well , it ’s over now . Huds , we can play later . ”
356681	356684	356685	356685	I	884	“ Mirabelle , ”
356727	356738	356724	356724	she	9246	“ Enjoy the rest of the day with your girlfriend . ”
356754	356761	356762	356762	Celia	9246	“ I ’m not his girlfriend , ”
356779	356787	356768	356768	she	9246	“ Why did n’t you correct her ? ”
356867	356886	356857	356857	I	884	“ Mirabelle ’s a hopeless romantic . She ’ll form her own opinion no matter what I say . ”
356910	356918	356900	356900	I	884	“ She still does n’t like me . ”
356926	356929	356930	356930	I	884	“ Sorry , ”
357011	357030	356999	356999	Celia	9246	“ She ’s fourteen . I get it . I wish it were different , but I understand . ”
357031	357039	357116	357116	I	884	“ She needs to learn some manners . ”
357040	357067	357068	357068	She	9246	“ And you need to learn to relax . I ’m fine . I do n’t have to be her friend . I ’m your friend . ”
357079	357115	357068	357068	She	9246	“ At least , I think we ’re still friends . It ’s been nine months since I left for San Francisco and not a single peep from you . What ’s up with that ? ”
357279	357301	357273	357273	I	884	“ Millie should have lunch ready soon . I can grab a shower and then we can catch up over sandwiches . ”
357305	357322	357302	357302	Celia	9246	“ Actually , I ca n’t today . I only got away for a few minutes . ”
357350	357358	357347	357347	she	9246	“ Will you be here all summer ? ”
357441	357444	357445	357445	I	884	“ Yes , ”
357448	357452	357445	357445	I	884	“ Will you ? ”
357453	357465	357466	357466	She	9246	“ I will . And I ’d like to see you . ”
357478	357507	357466	357466	She	9246	“ I came by today to tell you something . Um , something that I thought might make it easier for you to want to see me again . ”
357521	357526	357516	357516	She	9246	“ What is it ? ”
357535	357558	357527	357527	She	9246	“ I thought you should know that I ’m seeing someone . I have been all year . We ’re quite serious . ”
357573	357577	357578	357578	I	884	“ All right , ”
357581	357584	357578	357578	I	884	“ Congratulations . ”
357614	357642	357608	357608	She	9246	“ I thought that might be the reason you had n’t returned any of my messages . Because you were worried that I … that I still … ”
357702	357709	357698	357698	she	9246	“ That you still liked me ? ”
357717	357726	357710	357710	Her	9246	“ Yes . You did know , then . ”
357730	357736	357727	357727	I	884	“ Everyone knew , Celia . ”
357749	357775	357737	357737	She	9246	“ Okay , everyone knew . But it was a silly schoolgirl crush . I ’m over it now . I have Dirk , and — ”
357776	357784	357737	357737	She	9246	“ Dirk ? That ’s his name ? ”
357833	357839	357841	357841	her	9246	“ Be nice , Hudson . ”
357848	357871	357872	357872	She	9246	“ Anyway . I have Dirk and I ’m really in love with him . I think he might be the one . ”
357891	357896	357900	357900	I	884	“ That’s … great . ”
357928	357960	357920	357920	She	9246	“ So you and I can go back to being friends . No more weird puppy dog eyes from me . And it should n’t be a big deal . Okay ? ”
358014	358017	358007	358007	I	884	“ Sure . ”
358018	358021	358022	358022	Her	9246	“ Awesome ! ”
358027	358051	358022	358022	Her	9246	“ I ’ll call you . Maybe we can play tennis later this week ? Or take the Jet Skis out or something ? ”
358052	358056	358063	358063	she	9246	“ Sounds good . ”
358111	358116	358117	358117	Celia	9246	“ Well , then , ”
358128	358135	358117	358117	Celia	9246	“ I ’d better be going . ”
358141	358148	358136	358136	Chivalry	447	“ I ’ll walk you out . ”
358245	358255	358233	358233	She	9246	“ Thank you , Hudson . See you soon . ”
358397	358403	358404	358404	Mirabelle	1120	“ Do you like her ? ”
358449	358461	358437	358437	I	884	“ It ’s really none of your business if I do . ”
358481	358503	358471	358471	Mirabelle	1120	“ She ’s not for you , Hudson . She ’s petty and shallow and not good for you at all . ”
358519	358544	358514	358514	Mirabelle	1120	“ And you do n’t like her . I can see it in your eyes . You have no interest in her at all . ”
358583	358600	358573	358573	I	884	“ If you already know I do n’t like her , then why did you ask ? ”
358601	358611	358568	358568	she	10263	“ I wanted to be sure you knew too . ”
359874	359878	359879	359879	She	4817	“ Whatcha doing ? ”
359898	359903	359904	359904	I	884	“ Nothing of importance , ”
359913	359932	359908	359908	I	884	“ Actually , I ’m working on a project . For a friend . Perhaps you could help ? ”
359933	359936	359937	359937	She	4817	“ Sure . ”
359958	359963	359944	359944	I	884	“ What is it ? ”
360113	360116	360117	360117	I	884	“ Well , ”
360120	360133	360117	360117	I	884	“ he wants to know the best way to woo a girl — ”
360140	360159	360134	360134	Her	1120	“ And he asked you ? Anyone with half a brain knows you know nothing about wooing anyone . ”
360175	360184	360160	360160	I	884	“ Exactly . So I ’m asking you . ”
360185	360206	360207	360207	She	1120	“ This is n’t really for you , is it ? You are n’t interested in someone , are you ? ”
360222	360234	360207	360207	She	1120	“ You are n’t trying to woo Celia , are you ? ”
360277	360296	360272	360272	I	884	“ Now why would I try to woo Celia ? You said yourself she was n’t for me . ”
360297	360302	360303	360303	She	1120	“ Just making sure . ”
360310	360335	360303	360303	She	1120	“ Let ’s see , women love the artsy , creative types of attention . Like write her a poem or draw her portrait . ”
360347	360351	360336	360336	I	884	“ Go on . ”
360352	360369	360303	360303	She	1120	“ Then there ’s the easy stuff — sending flowers , buying jewelry , giving gifts — ”
360376	360389	360336	360336	I	884	“ But those are really lame if you do n’t personalize them . ”
360397	360405	360390	360390	I	884	“ What do you mean by personalize ? ”
360406	360445	360446	360446	God	8844	“ Do n’t just give roses . Those are boring . Give flowers that you know she ’ll like or that mean something to her . The jewelry should be unique to her or something she ’s admired . ”
360464	360482	360483	360483	Mirabelle	1120	“ Basically , all a woman wants is for you to spend time getting to know her , ”
360493	360507	360490	360490	I	884	“ As if you know what it ’s like to be a woman . ”
360508	360517	360518	360518	She	1120	“ Shut up . A girl , then . ”
360531	360544	360518	360518	She	1120	“ You know girls are just miniature women , do n’t you ? ”
360545	360552	360553	360553	I	884	“ I ’ve heard that somewhere . ”
360574	360579	360580	360580	I	884	“ Then all I — ”
360587	360601	360580	360580	I	884	“ All my friend has to do is spend time with this girl ? ”
360602	360614	360615	360615	She	1120	“ And then show that he ’s noticed who she is . ”
360618	360625	360615	360615	She	1120	“ Does that make any sense ? ”
360626	360630	360634	360634	people	726	“ It does . ”
360672	360683	360665	360665	my	884	“ I ’m sure my friend will appreciate this advice . ”
360696	360712	360684	360684	Mirabelle	1120	“ I wish it were for you though . You ’d make an awesome boyfriend . ”
360726	360741	360713	360713	I	884	“ Tell you what — I’ll save the notes for when I need them . ”
361464	361469	361453	361453	My	884	“ Yes , Patricia ? ”
361477	361487	361453	361453	My	884	“ Your two o’clock is here . Dr. Alberts . ”
361488	361491	361492	361492	I	884	“ Fuck . ”
361501	361511	361492	361492	I	884	“ Fine . Thank you . Send him in . ”
361803	361812	361813	361813	he	452	“ What ’s on your mind , Hudson ? ”
362000	362005	361982	361982	I	884	“ I saw Celia . ”
362006	362010	362011	362011	Alberts	452	“ You did ? ”
362025	362034	362011	362011	Alberts	452	“ What were the circumstances of that encounter ? ”
362035	362051	362052	362052	I	884	“ I ’d like to say it was innocent . But it was n’t entirely . ”
362067	362089	362052	362052	I	884	“ She called me . She ’s been using my identity to play someone — an employee of my sister ’s . ”
362118	362127	362052	362052	I	884	“ Were you aware she was doing this ? ”
362128	362131	362132	362132	I	884	“ Yes . ”
362145	362159	362132	362132	I	884	“ No , I did n’t encourage it , but I was aware . ”
362170	362205	362160	362160	I	884	“ Celia asked me to help her wrap up the game . I agreed . I told her where I ’d be and when . She made the arrangements for the rest to happen . ”
362297	362312	362292	362292	he	676	“ How did it make you feel ? Playing again , after so long ? ”
362508	362514	362515	362515	I	884	“ There was a rush , ”
362519	362537	362515	362515	I	884	“ Then it was over , and until now I had n’t given it a second thought . ”
362607	362623	362602	362602	He	452	“ Then you are n’t concerned that you ’ll be pulled back into the game ? ”
362654	362661	362648	362648	Celia	9246	“ No , I ’m not . ”
362662	362671	362672	362672	My	884	“ Do you plan to see her again ? ”
362684	362686	362681	362681	I	884	“ her ”
362705	362717	362718	362718	She	4855	“ No , I do n’t plan to see Celia again . ”
362814	362820	362791	362791	I	884	“ Hudson , sit down . ”
362842	362856	362831	362831	I	884	“ Sorry . I have a lot on my plate at the moment . ”
362885	362912	362871	362872	Dr. Alberts	452	“ I do n’t sense that your anxiety has to do with your meeting with Celia . Is there something else you are n’t telling me ? ”
362943	362952	362938	362938	I	884	“ It ’s nothing . Work is stressful . ”
362972	363011	362960	362960	I	884	“ I hate to beat a dead horse , Hudson , but if we met in my office instead of here , you ’d have a chance to escape that stress , if even for a short time . ”
363018	363035	363012	363012	I	884	“ If I had to meet in your office , I ’d never pull myself away . ”
363036	363114	362960	362960	I	884	“ That ’s a problem , Hudson . I ’ve tolerated it for the past two years , but I feel we ’re at a point in your therapy that this will no longer work . If you want to continue with your recovery , you need to make it your priority . You must decide that pulling yourself away is more important , that your mental health is more important than the work you leave behind . ”
363408	363411	363412	363412	I	884	“ Touché , ”
363415	363434	363412	363412	I	884	“ I concede that this arrangement is no longer working . Perhaps we should end our relationship altogether . ”
363478	363500	363467	363468	my psychologist	4863	“ If that ’s what you want to do . You know this only works if you ’re a willing participant . ”
363527	363535	363517	363517	I	884	“ I need to think about it . ”
363536	363564	363565	363565	He	4858	“ Do that . If you decide you want to meet with me again — in my office — than call my secretary and make an appointment . ”
363611	363617	363601	363601	I	884	“ Thank you , Doctor . ”
363618	363626	363627	363627	he	4858	“ I hope I see you again , ”
363719	363731	363707	363707	He	676	“ Remember , Hudson , true progress only happens with work . ”
363887	363893	363894	363894	She	4844	“ Were there any calls ? ”
363914	363919	363894	363894	She	4844	“ No , sir . ”
363941	363945	363946	363946	he	676	“ Jordan here , ”
363972	363980	363981	363981	I	884	“ Have you found anything out yet ? ”
364002	364019	364020	364020	Her	4871	“ Not much . I ’m still waiting for her medical history and complete background check . ”
364038	364046	364020	364020	Her	4871	“ What do you know so far ? ”
364047	364126	364020	364020	Her	4871	“ The basics . Her full name is Alayna Reese Withers , born and raised in Boston . Her parents died in a car accident when she was sixteen . She lives between Lexington and Third , near the Waldorf . She got her BA in business at Boston University and is set to graduate from NYU with a Masters in Business next month . Right now she ’s working as an assistant manager at The Sky Launch . ”
364141	364145	364131	364131	I	884	“ The nightclub ? ”
364146	364149	364020	364020	Her	4871	“ Yep . ”
364172	364185	364165	364165	She	4872	“ Can you tell if anyone else has pulled her information recently ? ”
364222	364238	364216	364216	he	655	“ The system says there was one other pull of her credit history . Yesterday . ”
364239	364242	364243	364243	I	884	“ Dammit . ”
364257	364264	364243	364243	I	884	“ Find out who ordered that . ”
364273	364277	364243	364243	I	884	“ On it . ”
364278	364289	364303	364303	Patricia	9246	“ And call me the minute anything new comes in . ”
364290	364296	364243	364243	I	884	“ Yes , Mr. Pierce . ”
364327	364334	364335	364336	my secretary	4844	“ I ’m sorry , sir , ”
364342	364355	364335	364336	my secretary	4844	“ I was calling to announce her and she just walked in . ”
364356	364368	364369	364369	I	884	“ It ’s okay . I ’ll take care of her . ”
364414	364425	364399	364399	Celia	9246	“ You ’ll take care of me , will you ? ”
364432	364449	364426	364426	I	884	“ Two days in one week , Celia . To what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
364520	364540	364511	364511	She	9246	“ Oh , come on , Hudsy . Do n’t be that way . I ’m not the enemy . ”
364570	364576	364543	364543	she	9246	“ Why are you here ? ”
364588	364601	364585	364585	she	9246	“ I have something that I know is going to interest you . ”
364602	364605	364606	364606	I	884	“ Oh ? ”
364614	364628	364585	364585	she	9246	“ I ’m serious . You ’re going to want in on this . ”
364641	364655	364633	364633	She	9246	“ Celia , I ’ve told you , I do n’t play anymore . ”
364693	364717	364683	364683	I	884	“ You ’ve told me , you ’ve told me . Now I ’m telling you , you ’ll want in on this . ”
364787	364802	364784	364784	her	9246	“ I wo n’t want in on anything . But since you ’re here , ”
364811	364819	364803	364803	I	884	“ what is it you ’re planning ? ”
364827	364850	364820	364820	Her	9246	“ Look at you . You ’re dying to know . Your eyes blazed the minute you realized what I was offering . ”
364929	364936	364937	364937	I	884	“ Out with it , Ceeley . ”
364979	365003	364970	364970	She	9246	“ It ’s a basic scenario — make the girl fall for you and then deny her , watching her fall to pieces . ”
365066	365080	365054	365054	I	884	“ How original . What about that did you think would interest me ? ”
365086	365090	365081	365081	She	9246	“ The girl . ”
365440	365444	365428	365428	I	884	“ Not interested . ”
365547	365555	365544	365544	She	9246	“ I guess I was wrong then . ”
365568	365592	365544	365544	She	9246	“ I ’ll have to keep this little prize for myself . You really are out of the game , are n’t you ? ”
365884	365904	365873	365873	I	884	“ I ’m out of the game , Celia . You know this . When will you accept that ? ”
365961	366021	365958	365958	Celia	9246	“ I ’ll never accept it , Hudson . I ’d have to believe that people could change , and I do n’t believe that . Not fundamentally . Sooner or later you ’ll realize that it ’s killing you . You thrive on your experiments . They gave you reason to live . What else could replace that ? ”
366087	366113	366079	366079	I	884	“ Life replaces it , Ceeley . Sooner or later you grow up . Even the people with enough money not to . Even us . ”
366114	366128	366079	366079	I	884	“ Huh . You sound even more like Alayna Withers than I thought . ”
366156	366162	366145	366145	I	884	“ What do you mean ? ”
366238	366246	366247	366247	she	9246	“ If you ’d read the file , ”
366251	366256	366247	366247	she	9246	“ you ’d know . ”
366408	366411	366398	366398	Celia	9246	“ Upstairs . ”
366442	366448	366449	366449	she	4886	“ Just like old times , ”
366523	366537	366517	366517	I	884	“ This is an inappropriate conversation for my office . That ’s all . ”
366543	366546	366547	366547	she	4886	“ Exactly , ”
366550	366563	366547	366547	she	4886	“ Like all the conversations we ’ve had here in the past . ”
366790	366796	366775	366775	I	884	“ Let me have it . ”
366803	366810	366797	366797	She	9246	“ The file or the story ? ”
366811	366815	366816	366816	I	884	“ The file . ”
367036	367051	367015	367015	she	9246	“ She ’s staying there . At that night club . Even after graduation . ”
367086	367089	367090	367090	I	884	“ Why ? ”
367094	367118	367119	367119	Celia	9246	“ She wants to use her MBA to move up in management . Take over the place one day , was my impression . ”
367127	367144	367119	367119	Celia	9246	“ I chatted with the owner there when I inquired about doing a redesign for them . ”
367167	367178	367158	367158	she	9246	“ And the owner just shared info on his employees ? ”
367179	367228	367229	367229	She	9246	“ That ’s the thing . He does n’t want to be the owner anymore . He ’s selling . Asked me if I knew any buyers and highlighted a couple of his key staff to incentivize anyone with interest . I told him I might know someone . ”
367238	367246	367229	367229	She	9246	“ There ’s your in , Hudson . ”
367349	367354	367355	367355	Celia	9246	“ There ’s more , ”
367379	367385	367370	367370	Celia	9246	“ She ’s been arrested ? ”
367395	367415	367386	367386	Celia	9246	“ She violated a restraining order . Twice . Her brother ’s a lawyer and got her record buried . ”
367416	367430	367431	367431	Don	457	“ But you got it unburied . Let me guess — Don Timmons . ”
367507	367523	367499	367499	She	9246	“ Do n’t look so judgmental . Don got what he wanted out of it . ”
367602	367639	367584	367584	her	9246	“ Anyway , maybe the arrest is part of the reason she does n’t pursue another occupation . She may not want it uncovered and she knows that any decent corporate screening process would uncover it . ”
367640	367645	367646	367646	I	884	“ It ’s possible . ”
367760	367799	367821	367821	she	8844	“ On the other hand , the owner went on and on about Alayna ’s genuine love of her job . She seems to be really passionate about it . She has a vested interest in the club . ”
367890	367900	367901	367901	Celia	9246	“ But the arrest is n’t the big thing . ”
367917	367931	367901	367901	Celia	9246	“ The cause of it is . She has a mental health history . ”
368387	368397	368398	368398	My	884	“ This is not a game we ’re playing . ”
368415	368451	368409	368409	Celia	9246	“ That ’s too bad . I had a great scenario . We ’d pretend that our parents want us to marry — best lies are closest to the truth , as you always say . ”
368461	368521	368409	368409	Celia	9246	“ Your mother believes you ’ll never love anyone so you best marry me . You hire Alayna to be your girlfriend . To convince your parents to leave your romantic life alone . With all the pretending , the girl will fall for you . The scheme will end and we see what happens . Intriguing , no ? ”
368527	368533	368522	368522	I	884	“ We ’re not playing . ”
368534	368563	368584	368584	She	215	“ It would give you an excuse to get close to her . Do n’t deny that you want to . I can read you too , Hudson . ”
368575	368583	368569	368569	I	884	“ We ’re done here , Celia . ”
368599	368606	368607	368607	she	215	“ You ’re done , Hudson , ”
368615	368627	368628	368628	She	215	“ I ’m not . I can play her without you . ”
368635	368645	368628	368628	She	215	“ But be assured , I will play her . ”
368646	368657	368658	368658	I	884	“ Not this one , Celia . Find another play . ”
368673	368686	368628	368628	She	215	“ Yes , this one . The game ’s already in motion . ”
368710	368716	368694	368694	I	884	“ What have you done ? ”
368745	368754	368733	368733	I	884	“ I made an offer on the club . ”
368762	368777	368755	368755	I	884	“ There ’s been no time . The owner ca n’t have accepted already . ”
368798	368833	368788	368788	Celia	9246	“ I told him my offer was good for an hour . He ’s had no bites in the year that he ’s had it up for sale . He accepted on the spot . ”
368974	368977	368960	368960	I	884	“ Why ? ”
368986	369000	368960	368960	I	884	“ Why do you care if it ’s this girl or the next ? ”
369001	369011	368960	368960	I	884	“ Because you care if it ’s this girl . ”
369199	369215	369216	369216	She	215	“ If you agree to play , I ’ll let you buy my offer out . ”
369219	369224	369216	369216	She	215	“ Simple as that . ”
369481	369492	369497	369497	she	9246	“ How much is your offer on The Sky Launch ? ”
369523	369535	369514	369514	I	884	“ I ’ll have my financial advisor draw up the check . ”
369536	369542	369552	369553	Alayna Withers	8844	“ Game on , then ? ”
369586	369590	369576	369576	I	884	“ Game on . ”
369594	369634	369635	369635	Mirabelle	1120	“ … and if Sherry does n’t tell him that she likes him , then he ’s going to end up with Marisa . Which is just wrong . Lance should be with Sherry . Do n’t you think ? ”
369644	369653	369635	369635	Mirabelle	1120	“ Are you listening to me , Hudson ? ”
369654	369659	369635	369635	Mirabelle	1120	“ I am not . ”
369718	369725	369709	369709	Mirabelle	1120	“ You could at least pretend . ”
369796	369801	369802	369802	I	884	“ I could pretend , ”
369805	369827	369802	369802	I	884	“ I did n’t feel that was fair . If you want to keep chattering , that ’s fine with me . ”
369846	369860	369802	369802	I	884	“ But if you do , know that you ’re talking to yourself . ”
369869	369875	369861	369861	Mirabelle	1120	“ You are so mean ! ”
370278	370291	370292	370292	I	884	“ People in love are so lucky to have found each other , ”
370307	370319	370297	370297	I	884	“ You and he are lucky to have found each other . ”
370332	370341	370297	370297	I	884	“ He ’s lucky to have found you . ”
370578	370583	370584	370584	I	884	“ I ’m sorry , ”
370599	370608	370584	370584	I	884	“ This is wrong . I ’m sorry . ”
370754	370757	370753	370753	our	4945	“ break . ”
370903	370933	370891	370891	She	1858	“ Do n’t you think about going anywhere , Hudson Pierce . You ’re trapped tonight . You have to talk to me whether you want to or not . ”
370963	370972	370973	370973	I	884	“ I ’m not going anywhere , Ceeley , ”
370984	370993	370973	370973	I	884	“ I was merely standing to greet you . ”
371002	371019	370994	370994	She	1858	“ Next you ’re going to pretend you have n’t been avoiding me for two weeks . ”
371048	371059	371040	371040	I	884	“ Nah , I ’m not going to do that . ”
371068	371081	371061	371061	I	884	“ I ca n’t pretend with you , Ceeley . Not anymore . ”
371159	371172	371149	371149	she	9246	“ Then let ’s not pretend . Let ’s talk about this . ”
371263	371297	371260	371260	I	884	“ How about we not talk tonight ? Instead we just enjoy one of the last days of summer . We can talk tomorrow . Are you going to the Brookes ’ shindig ? ”
371359	371376	371349	371349	Celia	9246	“ Of course I ’m going . Christina would kick my ass if I did n’t . ”
371402	371430	371431	371431	I	884	“ I ’m going too . I ’ll meet you there . We can slip away when we do n’t have our parents breathing down our necks . ”
371448	371457	371458	371458	I	884	“ It will give us a chance to … ”
371475	371478	371471	371471	I	884	“ talk . ”
371479	371482	371483	371483	Her	1255	“ Right . ”
371496	371503	371483	371483	Her	1255	“ We’ll … talk … then . ”
371504	371507	371508	371508	I	884	“ Good . ”
371519	371539	371508	371508	I	884	“ I see swimsuit straps under that dress . If you want to get in , I will too . ”
372158	372165	372148	372148	Celia	9246	“ Everyone ’s drinking but me . ”
372186	372192	372178	372178	I	884	“ I ’m not drinking . ”
372196	372206	372193	372193	She	442	“ But you could get some if you wanted . ”
372244	372252	372235	372239	the bartender we ’d hired	4978	“ Why ca n’t you get one ? ”
372282	372295	372256	372256	she	442	“ My father ’s guarding the bar . I have no shot . ”
372303	372327	372256	372256	she	442	“ He already told me he wanted to find nothing in my hand tonight but Diet Coke . And he checks . See ? ”
372482	372489	372490	372490	I	884	“ I ’m standing up now , ”
372547	372581	372582	372582	I	884	“ Come with me . I do n’t believe the entire liquor cabinet was brought out to the patio . If it was , I know where my mother keeps her secret stash . ”
372661	372673	372652	372652	I	884	“ Also , I have something I want to give you . ”
372674	372678	372679	372679	Her	8280	“ You do ? ”
372684	372689	372679	372679	Her	8280	“ What is it ? ”
372690	372699	372679	372679	Her	8280	“ All in good time , my love . ”
372899	372902	372903	372903	I	884	“ Better ? ”
372916	372919	372920	372920	Celia	9246	“ Much . ”
372935	372938	372939	372939	She	9246	“ Woo ! ”
372950	372959	372939	372939	She	9246	“ Maybe I should have drank that slower . ”
372960	372963	372964	372964	I	884	“ Here . ”
372971	372979	372964	372964	I	884	“ Sit while I get your gift . ”
372986	373002	372980	372980	She	9246	“ It ’s not my birthday or anything . Why would you get me something ? ”
373003	373019	373020	373020	I	884	“ Do I need an occasion ? Besides , it ’s barely anything at all . ”
373268	373275	373276	373276	I	884	“ It ’s merely an option . ”
373289	373314	373276	373276	I	884	“ You can take or leave the information however you like . I wo n’t be offended if you think it ’s all shit . ”
373320	373332	373315	373315	She	9246	“ No . It ’s perfect . This idea is perfect . ”
373348	373354	373355	373355	Her	9246	“ Thank you , Hudson . ”
373375	373386	373355	373355	Her	9246	“ I ’m so moved . You ca n’t understand . ”
373387	373394	373355	373355	Her	9246	“ Really , it ’s nothing . ”
373395	373408	373409	373409	She	9246	“ Stop being humble . It ’s a lot . Thank you . ”
373425	373431	373418	373418	she	9246	“ Thank you so much . ”
373815	373818	373819	373819	My	884	“ Celia . ”
373824	373830	373819	373819	My	884	“ You have a boyfriend . ”
373831	373844	373845	373845	Her	9246	“ Ca n’t we pretend just for tonight that I do n’t ? ”
373877	373886	373867	373867	I	884	“ I told you I ’m done pretending . ”
374008	374016	374017	374018	my mother	442	“ You do n’t think I know ? ”
374025	374031	374017	374018	my mother	442	“ You and your whores . ”
374063	374072	374073	374074	my mother	442	“ How many have there been , Jack ? ”
374123	374126	374127	374127	Mirabelle	1120	“ Mom . ”
374137	374147	374127	374127	Mirabelle	1120	“ Stop yelling . You ’re making Chandler cry . ”
374148	374151	374152	374153	My father	8755	“ Erin . ”
374159	374170	374152	374153	My father	8755	“ Take Chandler up , will you ? And Mira . ”
374174	374190	374171	374171	Mirabelle	1120	“ I ’m old enough to stay up . I do n’t want to miss — ”
374191	374202	374211	374211	he	8755	“ Go . I ’ll be up when I can . ”
374240	374250	374226	374226	Dad	253	“ Sophia , let ’s talk about this later . ”
374258	374287	374251	374251	She	442	“ Just go now . Pretend to look after your children when you ’re really after that piece of ass . Everyone here knows you ’re fucking her . ”
374288	374295	374296	374296	He	8755	“ No one here knows anything . ”
374301	374334	374296	374296	He	8755	“ Because there ’s nothing to know . You ’ve had too much to drink , that ’s all . Planning this party has exhausted you . Lie down for a bit — ”
374348	374423	374335	374336	My mother	442	“ Do n’t you fucking patronize me . I know , Jack . I ’ve known forever . And I do n’t want to hear your excuses anymore . You ’re going to fuck who you want whether I ’m around or not , but I do n’t have to have it under my roof . Your skanks are no longer welcome in my house . You are no longer welcome in my house . ”
374424	374427	374429	374429	his	8755	“ Sophia . ”
374441	374470	374471	374471	She	5009	“ You can stay in the guest house from now on . Fuck whoever , whenever . Not in my house . Not in front of my children . ”
374484	374494	374471	374471	She	5009	“ And Erin ’s no longer on my payroll . ”
374502	374512	374513	374513	he	8755	“ It ’s not your fucking payroll , Sophia , ”
374516	374530	374513	374513	he	8755	“ I ’m the one who brings the goddamn money to the household . ”
374531	374552	374471	374471	She	5009	“ Is that so ? And just how is it that you have companies to run in the first place ? ”
374553	374576	374513	374513	he	8755	“ Yes , yes . You ’re right . I owe you every fucking thing I ’ve ever earned . I forgot . ”
374645	374691	374692	374692	He	8755	“ Look , you can yell at me about this all you want , Sophia . Tomorrow . Later tonight , even . But now , we have a garden full of guests that I ’m going to tend to . With or without you . ”
374704	374728	374729	374729	she	442	“ I ’m serious about the guest house , Jack . Do n’t even try to come back in here to sleep tonight , ”
374811	374821	374826	374826	Celia	9246	“ Do you think you should go to her ? ”
374831	374836	374826	374826	Celia	9246	“ Not my problem . ”
374853	374883	374850	374850	I	884	“ I did n’t mean that . I just do n’t want to embarrass her by letting her know we saw that . I ’ll go in a minute . ”
374884	374889	374890	374890	Celia	9246	“ I ’ll help , ”
374893	374914	374890	374890	Celia	9246	“ No . No , let me . She ’s drunk . You do n’t need to deal with that . ”
374940	374946	374947	374947	She	9246	“ Did your dad really … ”
374953	374962	374947	374947	She	9246	“ Did he really sleep with the nanny ? ”
375048	375054	375055	375055	I	884	“ I do n’t know , ”
375058	375078	375055	375055	I	884	“ Like I said , my mother ’s drunk . She does n’t know what she ’s talking about . ”
375105	375112	375097	375097	her	442	“ I ’m sorry , Hudson . ”
375341	375349	375350	375350	I	884	“ I ’m going to her now . ”
375376	375407	375350	375350	I	884	“ I ’m helping her to bed , and then I ’m going to bed myself . I ’ll see you at the Brookes ’ tomorrow . Goodnight , Celia . ”
375436	375441	375442	375442	she	9246	“ It ’s okay , ”
375445	375452	375442	375442	she	9246	“ It ’s okay to feel . ”
375553	375582	375549	375549	she	9246	“ And I understand if you need to go through this alone . I ’m here for you when you ’re ready , Hudson . I love you . ”
376199	376214	376194	376194	I	884	“ I need to sign that power of attorney if you have it ready . ”
376215	376219	376220	376220	She	10443	“ Of course . ”
376226	376232	376220	376220	She	10443	“ Boyd , will you — ”
376233	376236	376237	376239	The young man	4711	“ Certainly . ”
376321	376328	376329	376329	she	10443	“ Make yourself comfortable , Hudson , ”
376339	376351	376329	376329	she	10443	“ I expected you to ask for this earlier this afternoon . ”
376352	376359	376329	376329	she	10443	“ I lost track of time . ”
376507	376518	376498	376498	Boyd	421	“ If that ’s everything , I ’ll be leaving . ”
376519	376524	376525	376525	She	10443	“ Yes , right . ”
376531	376550	376525	376525	She	10443	“ It is rather late . Thank you for staying . I ’ll see you in the morning . ”
376551	376559	376498	376498	Boyd	421	“ Right . Tomorrow , Ms. Anders . ”
376596	376612	376593	376593	I	884	“ I - see - you - naked - on - a - regular - basis ”
376732	376742	376743	376743	she	10443	“ Are you sure you want to do this ? ”
376784	376789	376790	376790	I	884	“ I ’m positive . ”
376843	376862	376863	376863	She	10443	“ The price is reasonable enough , but , Hudson , this is not a good business investment . ”
376885	376893	376899	376899	her	10443	“ Is it a particularly bad one ? ”
376913	376929	376902	376902	She	10443	“ Not necessarily . If you ’re willing to give it some time and attention . ”
376930	376934	376941	376941	I	884	“ I am . ”
376981	376991	376956	376956	She	10443	“ Why are you so set on a nightclub ? ”
376992	377000	377001	377001	I	884	“ I own nightclubs in other cities . ”
377083	377126	377074	377074	my	884	“ Let me rephrase , why are you so interested in this night club ? I could get some people looking , and we could find something else local that ’s going to take less of your time and be more profitable . ”
377132	377138	377127	377127	I	884	“ How ’s your family ? ”
377139	377186	377074	377074	my	884	“ I love how you think changing the subject will distract me from pursuing this . I ’ll make you pay by actually answering your question . My brother ’s home now . I wish I could say fully recovered , but that will take time . ”
377233	377239	377240	377240	I	884	“ He ’ll get there , ”
377244	377260	377261	377261	Her	10443	“ I know he will . And Gwen ’s still at Eighty - Eighth Floor . ”
377268	377280	377261	377261	Her	10443	“ Now that ’s a nightclub you should look into buying . ”
377303	377317	377299	377299	Alayna	8844	“ There ’s asset in The Sky Launch I ca n’t get elsewhere . ”
377336	377364	377333	377333	she	8844	“ A star employee . I peg her as an up - and - comer in management and I want to be her employer when that happens . ”
377376	377407	377365	377365	Norma	10443	“ I ca n’t decide if you ’re being honest or blowing smoke up my ass . Whichever , you win . I ’ll stop giving you my two cents . ”
377408	377431	377437	377437	she	10443	“ You ’re one of the four most important people in my life other than my family . I value your opinion . ”
377450	377453	377454	377454	She	10443	“ Really ? ”
377465	377472	377454	377454	She	10443	“ Who are the other three ? ”
377480	377494	377473	377473	I	884	“ My secretary , my assistant , and my unofficial head of security . ”
377509	377522	377506	377506	Norma	10443	“ Is n’t it sad that they ’re all on your payroll ? ”
377523	377537	377538	377538	I	884	“ It ’s not sad . It ’s the way I like it . ”
377585	377596	377581	377581	Her	10443	“ Did I see Celia Werner here the other day ? ”
377645	377652	377636	377636	she	10443	“ Yes , she was here . ”
377653	377665	377636	377636	she	10443	“ You ’re not redecorating anything right now , are you ? ”
377715	377740	377707	377707	Norma	10443	“ As much as I ’m happy to see you with a woman in your life , I really wish it was n’t her . ”
377790	377799	377781	377781	I	884	“ Thank you for your help , Norma . ”
378813	378817	378818	378818	she	8844	“ Woo hoo ! ”
378828	378835	378818	378818	she	8844	“ Goddamn , that ’s nice ! ”
379293	379303	379304	379304	Her	8844	“ Now what can I get … you … ? ”
379466	379476	379455	379455	I	884	“ Single - malt Scotch . Neat , please . ”
379489	379500	379477	379477	She	8844	“ I have a 12 - year - old Macallan . ”
379501	379504	379477	379477	She	8844	“ Fine . ”
379942	379945	379930	379930	She	8844	“ Another ? ”
379946	379953	379954	379954	I	884	“ No , I ’m good . ”
380079	380083	380062	380062	I	884	“ Special occasion ? ”
380088	380103	380084	380084	Her	8844	“ Uh , yeah . My graduation . I walk tomorrow for my MBA . ”
380126	380136	380137	380137	I	884	“ Congratulations . Here ’s to your every success . ”
380152	380156	380157	380157	Her	8844	“ Thank you . ”
380245	380249	380238	380238	I	884	“ Keep it . ”
380250	380255	380238	380238	I	884	“ I ca n’t . ”
380256	380263	380238	380238	I	884	“ You can and you will . ”
380291	380298	380282	380282	I	884	“ Consider it a graduation gift . ”
380299	380302	380303	380303	She	8844	“ Okay . ”
380316	380319	380303	380303	She	8844	“ Thanks . ”
380349	380357	380358	380358	She	8844	“ Is this also a goodbye party ? ”
380363	380378	380358	380358	She	8844	“ I do n’t imagine you ’ll be using your MBA to continue bartending . ”
380395	380412	380413	380413	She	8844	“ Actually , I ’d like to move up here . I love the nightclub scene . ”
380437	380443	380434	380434	I	884	“ It makes you alive . ”
380444	380447	380448	380448	She	8844	“ Exactly . ”
380454	380458	380448	380448	She	8844	“ It shows . ”
380552	380555	380558	380560	the drunk kid	5120	“ Laynie ! ”
380670	380681	380667	380667	I	884	“ Do you do that with every number you receive ? ”
380707	380722	380703	380703	She	8844	“ Are you trying to figure out if I ’d throw away your number ? ”
380732	380735	380729	380729	I	884	“ Maybe . ”
380800	380816	380779	380779	she	8844	“ I would n’t throw yours away . I would n’t take yours at all . ”
380826	380831	380817	380817	I	884	“ Not your type ? ”
380832	380836	380817	380817	I	884	“ Not necessarily . ”
380848	380852	380837	380837	I	884	“ Why then ? ”
380853	380868	380869	380869	She	8844	“ Because you ’re looking for something temporary . Something fun to play with . ”
380914	380920	380921	380921	She	8844	“ And I get attached . ”
380924	380934	380921	380921	She	8844	“ Now does n’t that just scare you shitless ? ”
381008	381020	380991	380991	she	8844	“ You , Alayna Withers , do anything but scare me . ”
381055	381063	381046	381046	I	884	“ Congratulations again . Quite an accomplishment . ”
381811	381815	381802	381802	I	884	“ After you . ”
381975	381985	381961	381961	I	884	“ I do n’t need this . Do you ? ”
381986	381995	381961	381961	I	884	“ No , thank you , Mr. Pierce . ”
381996	381999	382000	382000	I	884	“ Hudson , ”
382003	382011	382015	382015	my	884	“ No , thank you , Hudson . ”
382029	382035	382021	382021	I	884	“ I ’ve already eaten . ”
382036	382050	382015	382015	my	884	“ A drink then ? Though , I know you work at eleven . ”
382084	382090	382075	382075	Alayna	8844	“ Maybe an iced tea . ”
382103	382106	382092	382092	I	884	“ Good . ”
382424	382428	382429	382429	I	884	“ Excuse me . ”
382491	382501	382502	382502	Alayna	8844	“ You can take it if you need to , ”
382505	382518	382502	382502	Alayna	8844	“ There ca n’t be anything important enough to interrupt this conversation . ”
382723	382752	382717	382717	I	884	“ I asked Liesl what you usually drank . If you had said you wanted something different , I would n’t look quite so cool at this moment . ”
382769	382784	382758	382758	she	8217	“ Hmm , cool is not quite the word I ’d use for you . ”
382791	382801	382758	382758	she	8217	“ What word would you use for me then ? ”
382835	382842	382829	382830	the waitress	8217	“ Anything else , Mr. Pierce ? ”
382843	382848	382849	382849	I	884	“ We ’re good . ”
382861	382872	382849	382849	I	884	“ What word would you use for me , Alayna ? ”
382878	382881	382873	382873	She	8217	“ Controlled . ”
382882	382885	382890	382890	she	8217	“ Interesting . ”
382910	382939	382896	382896	I	884	“ Not that controlled is n’t an accurate description of me . But I had thought from the look on your face that you would say something else . ”
383102	383115	383099	383099	I	884	“ I know why you agreed to dine with me , Alayna . ”
383152	383175	383125	383125	she	8217	“ I have to be honest with you . I do n’t intend to help you with your desire to make management . ”
383296	383360	383290	383290	I	884	“ That does n’t mean you wo n’t be promoted . David said you ’re quite capable , and I ’m sure you ’ll get the position without my help . I may own The Sky Launch , but I am not your boss . David is your boss and will continue to be unless the business no longer thrives under his command . ”
383382	383395	383361	383361	She	8217	“ But I did n’t invite you here to discuss the club . ”
383401	383408	383396	383396	Her	8217	“ Why did you invite me ? ”
383436	383442	383433	383433	her	8217	“ Perhaps I like you . ”
383534	383541	383526	383526	She	8844	“ Perhaps I ’m seeing someone . ”
383594	383612	383614	383614	she	8844	“ You are n’t . No man would let his woman wear the outfit you wore yesterday . ”
383671	383678	383668	383668	I	884	“ Not in public , anyway . ”
383696	383705	383691	383691	her	8844	“ Perhaps I ’m not into controlling boyfriends . ”
383708	383714	383715	383715	I	884	“ Very well , Alayna . ”
383720	383726	383715	383715	I	884	“ Are you seeing anyone ? ”
383762	383778	383748	383748	she	8844	“ That is n’t why you invited me , Hudson . You have an agenda . ”
383779	383783	383784	383784	I	884	“ An agenda . ”
383801	383811	383789	383789	She	8844	“ Yes , Alayna , I have an agenda . ”
383839	383852	383832	383832	I	884	“ I presume you enjoyed your time at my spa last week . ”
383948	383960	383963	383963	she	8844	“ Oh , I did n’t realize you owned … wait ... ”
383976	383983	383963	383963	she	8844	“ The gift was from you ? ”
383984	383994	383963	383963	she	8844	“ Yes . Did you have a nice time ? ”
383995	384000	384001	384001	Her	8844	“ No . Way . ”
384008	384012	384001	384001	Her	8844	“ No way ? ”
384065	384106	384113	384113	Alayna	8844	“ I mean , yes , I had a nice time — a wonderful time , in fact — but no way could you have done that . Why did you do that ? You should n’t have done that . ”
384107	384112	384155	384155	She	8844	“ Why ever not ? ”
384121	384127	384113	384113	Alayna	8844	“ Because that ’s big ! ”
384128	384133	384134	384134	I	884	“ Not for me . ”
384180	384227	384229	384229	her	8844	“ But for me it is . It ’s huge ! And you do n’t even know me ! It ’s completely inappropriate and unprofessional and unprecedented and inappropriate . And if I ’d known it was from you , I never would have accepted it . ”
384261	384283	384284	384284	I	884	“ It ’s not inappropriate at all . It was simply a gift . Think of it as a golden hello . ”
384305	384331	384341	384341	she	8844	“ But you do n’t give gifts like that to women who work for you unless you ’re running an entirely different kind of club . ”
384332	384339	384341	384341	she	8844	“ You ’re overreacting , Alayna . ”
384353	384358	384359	384359	Her	8844	“ I ’m not ! ”
384367	384385	384359	384359	Her	8844	“ And what do you mean a golden hello ? You mean , like a signing bonus ? ”
384386	384391	384392	384392	I	884	“ Yes , Alayna . ”
384399	384412	384392	384392	I	884	“ That ’s my agenda . I would like to hire you . ”
384413	384427	384428	384428	She	8844	“ I already work for you and I ’m happy where I am . ”
384440	384477	384481	384481	she	8844	“ Again , I do n’t feel that you do work for me . I am not your boss . I own the establishment that you work for . That is all . Is that clear ? ”
384702	384713	384714	384714	I	884	“ This would n’t affect your employment at the club . ”
384719	384751	384714	384714	I	884	“ Maybe hire is not the correct term . I ’d like to pay you to help me with a problem . I believe you ’d be perfect for the job . ”
384752	384766	384794	384794	God	8844	“ You win . My curiosity is piqued . What ’s the job ? ”
384783	384793	384794	384794	God	8844	“ I need you to break up an engagement . ”
384816	384823	384813	384813	She	8844	“ Um , what ? Whose ? ”
384832	384835	384827	384827	I	884	“ Mine . ”
384850	384873	384836	384836	She	8844	“ Close your mouth , Alayna . Although it ’s quite adorable to see you flabbergasted , it ’s also very distracting . ”
384909	384918	384894	384894	She	8844	“ I did n’t realize you were engaged . ”
385116	385122	385112	385112	she	442	“ I ’m missing something . ”
385126	385132	385123	385123	I	884	“ I suppose you are . ”
385178	385200	385202	385202	Mirabelle	1120	“ Alayna , if there is anyone in the world who has any power over me , it ’s my mother . ”
385215	385223	385202	385202	Mirabelle	1120	“ My mother knows that I am … ”
385239	385274	385235	385235	I	884	“ … incapable … of love . She worries that I will … end up alone . A marriage with her best friend ’s daughter , at least , insures that wo n’t happen . ”
385420	385435	385413	385413	Alayna	8844	“ So I ’m supposed to be the floozy you ’re in love with ? ”
385455	385475	385476	385476	I	884	“ No one would ever mistake you as a floozy , Alayna . Even when you dress like one . ”
385516	385531	385506	385506	She	442	“ Why do n’t you hire a real floozy to put on your charade ? ”
385532	385562	385500	385500	she	442	“ My mother would never believe I ’d fall for a floozy . You , however , have particular qualities — qualities that would make the story quite believable . ”
385563	385569	385506	385506	She	442	“ What sort of qualities ? ”
385600	385613	385592	385592	I	884	“ You are exquisitely beautiful , Alayna , and also extremely intelligent . ”
385614	385617	385618	385618	She	442	“ Oh . ”
385680	385699	385674	385674	I	884	“ And you ’re a brunette . All three make you ‘ my type ’ so to say . ”
385996	386006	386007	386007	she	8844	“ What exactly would you want me to do ? ”
386055	386096	386048	386048	I	884	“ Pretend we ’re a couple . I ’d invite you to several gatherings where my mother would see us together . I ’d expect you to hang on my arm and behave as though we ’re madly in love . ”
386097	386103	386150	386150	her	8844	“ And that ’s all ? ”
386104	386109	386048	386048	I	884	“ That ’s all . ”
386153	386168	386141	386141	I	884	“ This pretend relationship — to what extent would I be expected to perform ? ”
386296	386309	386283	386283	I	884	“ Do n’t pussyfoot about it . You ’re asking about sex . ”
386362	386382	386351	386351	I	884	“ I never pay for sex , Alayna . When I fuck you , it will be for free . ”
386427	386433	386434	386434	she	8844	“ Maybe I should go , ”
386437	386443	386444	386444	I	884	“ Do you want to ? ”
386457	386472	386473	386473	She	8844	“ I ’m n - not sure . Yes . I think I should . ”
386506	386515	386516	386516	I	884	“ Because you ’re uncomfortable with my proposition ? ”
386530	386544	386522	386522	I	884	“ Or because I told you that I ’m going to fuck you ? ”
386545	386552	386561	386561	she	8844	“ I’m … yes . That . ”
386575	386616	386568	386568	she	8844	“ But I‘m certain that ’s not a surprise to you , Alayna . You feel the electricity between us . Your body language expresses it quite well . I would n’t be surprised to find you ’re already wet . ”
386632	386647	386627	386627	I	884	“ Do n’t be embarrassed . Do n’t you know I feel the same ? ”
386663	386679	386627	386627	I	884	“ If you were to carefully read my body , you ’d see the evidence . ”
386804	386861	386800	386800	I	884	“ Let ’s table my proposition to hire you for a moment and discuss this other thing further . Please understand that they are very separate from each other . I ’d never want you to think my sexual desire for you was in any way part of a sham for my parents and their friends . ”
386862	386879	386880	386880	She	8844	“ I’m — I do n’t know how to react to someone stating they desire me . ”
386895	386904	386892	386892	I	884	“ Has no man told you that before ? ”
387006	387021	387000	387000	She	8844	“ Not in so many words . Actions sometimes . Certainly not so bluntly . ”
387029	387035	387022	387022	I	884	“ That ’s a shame . ”
387100	387111	387090	387090	I	884	“ I plan to tell you every chance I get . ”
387176	387179	387170	387170	She	8844	“ Oh . ”
387195	387222	387189	387189	She	8844	“ I , uh , I ’m feeling a bit overwhelmed . I need to go . You ’ve given me a lot to think about . ”
387279	387291	387271	387271	I	884	“ I wish you would n’t . But if you must … ”
387299	387308	387292	387292	She	8844	“ I ’ve got to get to work . ”
387389	387394	387395	387395	My	884	“ Wait , Alayna . ”
387437	387490	387428	387428	I	884	“ I apologize for overwhelming you . That was n’t my intent . But I want you to know that whether or not you decide to help with my situation , I will continue to seduce you . I ’m a man who gets what he wants . And I want you . ”
387604	387635	387594	387594	her	8844	“ I should have told you earlier — you look absolutely beautiful tonight . I ca n’t keep my eyes off you . Serious and sexy wrapped into one package . ”
387658	387664	387647	387647	I	884	“ Kiss me , Alayna . ”
388053	388063	388045	388045	I	884	“ Not here , precious . Not like this . ”
388079	388098	388064	388064	I	884	“ I will have you beneath me . In a bed . Where I can adore you properly . ”
388193	388209	388187	388187	I	884	“ Now we have each other ’s numbers . I expect you to use it . ”
388255	388263	388247	388247	I	884	“ Call me when you ’re ready . ”
388284	388287	388281	388281	I	884	“ Tomorrow . ”
389285	389289	389290	389290	She	442	“ Hudson Pierce . ”
389300	389307	389290	389290	She	442	“ It took you long enough . ”
389312	389319	389308	389308	I	884	“ To get to the party ? ”
389320	389327	389328	389328	She	442	“ To come looking for me . ”
389367	389380	389349	389349	she	442	“ I did n’t come looking for you . You summoned me . ”
389381	389386	389387	389387	Her	442	“ That I did . ”
389399	389404	389387	389387	Her	442	“ And you came . ”
389405	389415	389387	389387	Her	442	“ No , I did n’t . Not yet . ”
389506	389514	389515	389515	Her	442	“ Oh , such a naughty boy . ”
389524	389541	389515	389515	Her	442	“ I sure hope that you have n’t already chosen your target for when you do . ”
389542	389548	389515	389515	Her	442	“ And why is that ? ”
389549	389557	389515	389515	Her	442	“ Because I ’d like to volunteer . ”
389568	389584	389558	389558	I	884	“ That ’s funny that you think you ’d have any choice in the matter . ”
389599	389620	389585	389585	I	884	“ I mean , if you ’re my target , I ’d hit it , whether invited to or not . ”
389628	389637	389621	389621	Her	442	“ Damn . You just soaked my panties . ”
389662	389671	389638	389638	I	884	“ Maybe you should n’t be wearing any . ”
389672	389678	389638	389638	I	884	“ That could be arranged . ”
389727	389746	389747	389747	She	442	“ Why are you alone anyway , Christina ? I expected to see Celia hanging at your side . ”
389753	389759	389747	389747	She	442	“ She was here earlier . ”
389760	389765	389747	389747	She	442	“ She already left ? ”
389780	389795	389796	389796	Christina	442	“ She might be back later . She said she needed some recovery time . ”
389854	389863	389848	389848	Christina	442	“ She broke up with her boyfriend today . ”
389922	389931	389932	389932	I	884	“ Are you sure they really broke up ? ”
389951	389965	389966	389966	Christina	442	“ Yeah , I ’m sure . She was here when he called . ”
389994	390047	389982	389982	She	442	“ I do n’t think she was planning to dump him , exactly , but one minute she was saying hello and the next she was saying she was sorry it was over . Yeah , I eavesdropped , but she did n’t leave the room , so I figured fair game . ”
390048	390051	390057	390057	her	442	“ Damn . ”
390167	390183	390158	390158	My	884	“ Why did Celia do that ? I thought she was really into her boyfriend . ”
390187	390199	390184	390184	Christina	442	“ You did not . You thought she was into you . ”
390212	390224	390225	390225	She	442	“ And she is . She dumped him because of you . ”
390292	390302	390284	390284	Christina	442	“ Obviously , you do n’t return the feeling . ”
390303	390325	390326	390326	God	8844	“ And she thinks of you as a close friend , Christina . Obviously , you do n’t return that feeling . ”
390345	390356	390357	390357	She	442	“ Au contraire . I love her like a sister . ”
390378	390393	390357	390357	She	442	“ But she is not Hudson Pierce material . She could never handle you . ”
390394	390401	390404	390404	my	884	“ And you think you can ? ”
390481	390487	390488	390488	Her	442	“ I know I can . ”
390513	390516	390497	390497	she	442	“ Interesting . ”
390517	390534	390535	390535	She	442	“ Is it really ? Because I ’ll tell you what I think would be interesting . ”
390624	390651	390616	390616	I	884	“ Unless it starts with my tongue in your mouth and ends with my cock in your cunt , I do n’t want to hear it . ”
390666	390677	390656	390656	she	442	“ Let ’s go to my bedroom , shall we ? ”
390696	390719	390720	390720	She	442	“ I ’ll give you two minutes and wherever we are in that time , that ’s where you ’re getting fucked . ”
391225	391230	391216	391216	I	884	“ Spread your legs , ”
391379	391389	391390	391390	I	884	“ Please tell me you ’re on birth control . ”
391460	391466	391467	391467	Her	442	“ Yes . The pill . ”
391495	391536	391537	391537	I	884	“ Of course you are . Because you ’re a dirty little slut , are n’t you ? You have to take precautions because you never know when you ’ll let yourself be fucked . Whenever you get the opportunity . ”
391575	391579	391580	391580	I	884	“ Say it , ”
391583	391600	391580	391580	I	884	“ Tell me you ’re a dirty slut . Tell me you love to be fucked . ”
391601	391614	391615	391615	She	442	“ I ’m a dirty slut . I love to be fucked . ”
391630	391638	391639	391639	I	884	“ Yes , you do love it . ”
391658	391704	391705	391705	I	884	“ Now , Christina , you need to get ready to come . Because I ’m coming soon and I ’m not waiting for you . You ’re so good at being fucked , though , I do n’t think it will be a problem . ”
391944	391950	391936	391936	her	442	“ Oh , my God . ”
391961	391966	391967	391967	She	442	“ Fuck ! Celia . ”
391983	391988	391989	391989	Celia	9246	“ I ’m sorry . ”
391994	392002	391989	391989	Celia	9246	“ I ’ve made a terrible mistake . ”
392109	392131	392097	392097	I	884	“ Take off your skirt and panties and wait for me here . Next time I wo n’t be so gentle . ”
392210	392215	392216	392216	I	884	“ Celia , wait , ”
392251	392257	392237	392237	She	9246	“ Fuck you , Hudson . ”
392258	392264	392265	392265	I	884	“ Come on , wait . ”
392296	392306	392283	392283	She	9246	“ What ? What do you want from me ? ”
392370	392384	392364	392364	I	884	“ We were going to talk . I came here tonight to talk . ”
392401	392429	392385	392385	She	9246	“ That ’s fucking hilarious . You came here to talk to me and what ? You could n’t find me so you talked to Christina instead ? ”
392503	392514	392515	392515	My	884	“ What is it that I did wrong , Celia ? ”
392528	392549	392515	392515	My	884	“ You act as though I owe you something . What exactly do you think is going on between us ? ”
392565	392579	392556	392556	she	9246	“ I told you I loved you , Hudson . You kissed me . ”
392585	392590	392556	392556	she	9246	“ You kissed me . ”
392591	392608	392556	392556	she	9246	“ And you insinuated that the only reason you stopped was because I had a boyfriend . ”
392653	392660	392640	392640	I	884	“ No . No , Ceeley . ”
392668	392704	392661	392661	I	884	“ I ’m truly sorry if you got the wrong impression . I was simply reminding you not to throw away your relationship with Dirk simply because you remembered how you once felt for me . ”
392705	392712	392713	392713	Her	9246	“ How I felt for … ? ”
392719	392734	392713	392713	Her	9246	“ That is not what happened . You were feeling things for me too . ”
392735	392742	392713	392713	Her	9246	“ No . I was n’t . ”
392769	392810	392764	392764	I	884	“ I mean , I care for you . A great deal . I always have , I always will . I know that ’s probably hard to hear , but that ’s all I ’ve ever felt regarding you . ”
392847	392857	392837	392837	her	9246	“ What … what are you doing , Hudson ? ”
392907	392917	392900	392900	I	884	“ I ’m trying to straighten out this misunderstanding . ”
392922	392934	392935	392935	Her	9246	“ No , you ’re not . You ’re running away . ”
392972	393007	392964	392964	I	884	“ You ’re convinced that you should n’t be allowed to feel anything or that having emotions will make you weak or something equally as ridiculous , and so you ’re pushing me away . ”
393056	393062	393063	393063	she	9246	“ Stop pushing me away , ”
393115	393129	393130	393130	I	884	“ You do n’t have a fucking clue what you ’re talking about , ”
393148	393171	393133	393133	Her	9246	“ Stop this , Hudson . Stop lying to me . Stop lying to yourself . This is n’t who you are . ”
393190	393217	393184	393184	I	884	“ This is who I am , Celia . Do n’t you dare think you know something different . What you see is what you get . ”
393218	393225	393226	393226	Her	9246	“ You ’re a fucking coward . ”
393245	393274	393239	393239	she	9246	“ This was your chance to be a man , Hudson . I could have even forgiven your thing with Christina if you could just be honest now . ”
393275	393281	393282	393282	My	884	“ You could forgive me ? ”
393289	393304	393282	393282	My	884	“ Well , hell . How will I ever go on without your pardon ? ”
393380	393390	393391	393391	She	9246	“ Scratch coward . I meant to say asshole . ”
393428	393514	393412	393412	I	884	“ Jesus , you ’re really a piece of work , Celia Werner . What did you think was going to happen between us ? You thought I was going to love you ? You thought we were going to ride off into the sunset together ? You ’re the one who needs to stop lying to yourself . That ’s a fairy tale , Ceeley , and I stopped believing in those a long time ago . It ’s time you grew up too . ”
393876	393883	393865	393865	Mirabelle	1120	“ Why are you still awake ? ”
393884	393891	393892	393892	She	9246	“ What ’s it to you ? ”
393910	393930	393906	393906	she	9246	“ It ’s summer . I do n’t have a curfew . Or a nanny anymore , it appears . ”
393965	393973	393978	393978	her	1120	“ As long as you ’re up — ”
393982	393991	393978	393978	her	1120	“ What ’s Celia ’s car doing here ? ”
393999	394039	393992	393993	My sister	10263	“ She came by . I told her you were n’t home and she said she ’d wait for you on the patio . That was , like , two hours ago . She probably fell asleep out there . ”
394040	394043	394044	394044	I	884	“ Fuck , ”
394091	394098	394085	394085	I	884	“ Get to bed , Mirabelle . ”
394099	394104	394133	394133	she	1120	“ I do n’t — ”
394105	394110	394085	394085	I	884	“ Get to bed . ”
394111	394114	394115	394115	She	1120	“ Fine . ”
394123	394129	394115	394115	She	1120	“ never having any fun . ”
395327	395334	395335	395335	Celia	9246	“ It ’s about fucking time , ”
395343	395355	395356	395356	I	884	“ Since when have frequent check - ins been a requirement ? ”
395379	395391	395392	395392	She	9246	“ They ’re not a requirement . They ’re a courtesy . ”
395398	395415	395392	395392	She	9246	“ Right now , I do n’t even know if this is a go or not . ”
395416	395422	395423	395423	I	884	“ It ’s a go . ”
395480	395483	395487	395487	her	9246	“ Good . ”
395494	395509	395487	395487	her	9246	“ Then our first outing is this Sunday at your mother ’s charity event ? ”
395510	395514	395515	395515	I	884	“ It is . ”
395654	395663	395636	395636	she	9246	“ Is that all you need , Celia ? ”
395664	395675	395636	395636	she	9246	“ No . I ’d like to hear the details . ”
395688	395720	395723	395723	she	9246	“ I ’m not sharing details . Not today and not in the future . I ’m not checking in with you . You will not call me regarding the situation . ”
395736	395768	395731	395731	I	884	“ I ’ve arranged things as you ’ve requested , Celia . And I ’ll follow through , though I realize I have no reason at this point to do so . ”
395769	395799	395803	395803	her	9246	“ Because you own the club now ? Hudson , you know as well as I do that I would find another way to follow through with my experiment . ”
395816	395860	395809	395809	she	9246	“ I ’m invested in this project now . I wo n’t let it go . It has such great potential . Frankly , I ’m disappointed that you are n’t as intrigued as I am by the emotional psyche of Alayna Withers . ”
395889	395906	395886	395886	I	884	“ I do n’t believe you ’re going to see the results you believe you are . ”
395934	395950	395931	395931	Celia	9246	“ We have different hypotheses . That only intrigues me more . You know that . ”
396219	396233	396193	396193	Alayna	8844	“ Celia , I have a matter I need to take care of . ”
396251	396261	396193	396193	Alayna	8844	“ I ’ll see you Sunday at the event . ”
396507	396510	396511	396511	I	884	“ Roger , ”
396517	396523	396511	396511	I	884	“ What ’s going on ? ”
396572	396582	396583	396583	he	5301	“ The board is seriously considering this latest offer , ”
396587	396590	396591	396591	I	884	“ Fuck , ”
396647	396658	396659	396659	Roger	212	“ It ’s not going to get better , Pierce , ”
396662	396688	396659	396659	Roger	212	“ I know you ’re coming on Monday , but Grant and some of the others are planning to take a vote over the weekend . ”
396797	396824	396784	396784	I	884	“ Roger , I do n’t want to hear that we lost this company because my staff was n’t able to foresee the possibility of separation . ”
396834	396838	396825	396825	I	884	“ Come in , ”
396919	396939	396904	396904	Roger	212	“ Take care of it , Roger . I expect this to be resolved before I arrive on Monday . ”
396972	396975	396976	396976	she	5307	“ Hi , ”
397189	397205	397181	397181	I	884	“ Jesus , Alayna . I want you so bad , I ’m not behaving . ”
397206	397209	397210	397210	Her	5307	“ Hudson . ”
397224	397235	397219	397219	She	5307	“ If this is misbehaving , please do n’t stop . ”
397271	397298	397268	397268	I	884	“ At least let me take you to a bed . If you keep this up , I ’m going to fuck you against the door . ”
397325	397338	397339	397339	she	5307	“ That does n’t sound like the worst thing in the world , ”
397362	397369	397349	397349	I	884	“ No , it does n’t . ”
397388	397406	397374	397374	I	884	“ But I wo n’t be able to savor you properly and I ’ll forever regret it . ”
397558	397575	397554	397554	she	5307	“ I imagined you ’d have beautiful breasts , Alayna . But I had no idea … ”
397732	397748	397719	397719	I	884	“ You ’re so responsive . I could spend all day sucking your gorgeous tits . ”
397757	397768	397719	397719	I	884	“ But there ’s so much of you to adore . ”
397812	397828	397829	397829	I	884	“ I want them digging into my back when you wrap your legs around me , ”
397900	397906	397907	397907	I	884	“ Lean on your elbows , ”
397946	397961	397964	397964	her	5307	“ You ’re so fucking sexy like this . All spread out for me . ”
397976	397988	397968	397968	I	884	“ You want me . Look how your pretty pussy throbs . ”
398065	398068	398069	398069	I	884	“ Again . ”
398201	398208	398209	398209	I	884	“ You ’re ready for me , ”
398276	398281	398282	398282	I	884	“ Jesus , Alayna . ”
398296	398303	398282	398282	I	884	“ You feel so goddamn good . ”
398331	398335	398322	398322	I	884	“ So good . ”
398592	398599	398600	398600	she	5307	“ I ’m going to come , ”
398603	398612	398614	398614	I	884	“ Yes . Yes , come , Alayna . ”
398941	398963	398925	398925	her	8844	“ I knew sex with you would be like that . Powerful and intense and fucking incredible . I knew it . ”
399055	399060	399061	399061	I	884	“ Sleep , precious . ”
399260	399270	399252	399252	I	884	“ I need to order dinner . Chinese okay ? ”
399271	399275	399276	399276	She	8844	“ Sounds delicious . ”
399311	399318	399303	399303	I	884	“ I ’ll call it in . ”
399592	399598	399588	399588	I	884	“ You ’re getting dressed ? ”
399669	399678	399653	399653	I	884	“ Are you in a hurry to leave ? ”
399751	399764	399765	399765	she	8844	“ Guys do n’t usually want me to hang around after sex , ”
399776	399795	399768	399768	I	884	“ That statement brings up so many issues for discussion that I do n’t know where to begin . ”
399813	399823	399806	399806	I	884	“ What is wrong with men to not … ? ”
399870	399919	399864	399864	I	884	“ Alayna , please do n’t group me with other guys you know . I ’d like to think I ’m not like most of them . And I do n’t want to know or think about you having sex with other men . I do n’t share . ”
399938	399956	399957	399957	she	8844	“ That sounds awfully relationship - y to me . I thought you did n’t do relationships , ”
399992	400015	399986	399986	I	884	“ I do n’t do romantic relationships . Sexual relationships are another thing entirely . Why are you getting ready to leave ? ”
400029	400032	400033	400033	I	884	“ Stop , ”
400091	400098	400099	400099	I	884	“ I want you to stay . ”
400118	400136	400099	400099	I	884	“ And , if you are so inclined , I ’d prefer that you not be dressed . ”
400144	400149	400137	400137	She	8844	“ You ’re dressed . ”
400182	400207	400152	400152	her	8844	“ As soon as the food ’s here , I ’ll be happy to lose the clothing . Would that make you feel better ? ”
400251	400254	400255	400255	she	8844	“ Yes , ”
400270	400276	400265	400265	she	8844	“ I do n’t know . ”
400326	400349	400314	400314	I	884	“ What ’s going on inside your head , precious ? Are you going to run off every time we have sex ? ”
400356	400375	400350	400350	She	8844	“ I had n’t really thought this would be more than a one - time thing , Hudson . ”
400444	400447	400434	400434	I	884	“ Alayna . ”
400453	400472	400434	400434	I	884	“ If you do n’t want to have sex with me again , you need to tell me . ”
400473	400480	400481	400481	She	8844	“ I do ! I do . ”
400534	400539	400540	400540	I	884	“ What is it ? ”
400545	400549	400540	400540	I	884	“ Tell me . ”
400575	400592	400569	400569	her	8844	“ I ’m not good at relationships . Of any sort . I have … issues . ”
400593	400597	400598	400598	I	884	“ Like what ? ”
400687	400699	400684	400684	I	884	“ Does this have anything to do with that restraining order ? ”
400706	400712	400700	400700	She	8844	“ You know about that ? ”
400885	400918	400863	400863	I	884	“ I know intimate things about you , precious — the way you look and the sounds you make when you ’re about to come — and you ’re concerned about this ? ”
400926	400950	400951	400951	She	8844	“ It was a big deal . The biggest deal . Like my biggest secret . I thought my brother had buried it . ”
400962	400982	400951	400951	She	8844	“ And are you saying I should be embarrassed about how I look and sound when … you know ? ”
401005	401039	400998	400998	I	884	“ I needed to know anything that might come up about my pretend girlfriend . It was n’t necessarily easy to find , but not incredibly hard . It ’s been buried now . ”
401059	401084	401047	401047	I	884	“ And never , never be ashamed of how you look or sound at any time , especially when you ’re about to come . ”
401092	401105	401085	401085	I	884	“ I ’m honored to be acquainted with you in that way . ”
401123	401128	401129	401129	She	8844	“ I ’m mortified . ”
401136	401156	401129	401129	She	8844	“ About the restraining order , I mean . I do n’t know how to react to the other . ”
401157	401160	401161	401161	Her	8844	“ Why ? ”
401257	401272	401286	401286	I	884	“ Because it makes me feel all weird and tingly . And turned on . ”
401273	401276	401277	401277	I	884	“ Fantastic . ”
401290	401300	401286	401286	I	884	“ But I meant , why are you mortified ? ”
401301	401304	401305	401305	She	8844	“ Oh . ”
401359	401368	401369	401369	she	8844	“ Because it ’s evidence of my crazy , ”
401372	401400	401369	401369	she	8844	“ You know when I said I love too much ? The restraining order is part of that , and I like to pretend it never happened . ”
401523	401529	401517	401517	I	884	“ Then it never did . ”
401557	401576	401553	401553	Mine	884	“ We ’ve all done insane things in the past . I ’d never hold it against you . ”
401648	401666	401640	401641	Alayna Withers	8844	“ Just another reason romantic love holds no interest for me . People get crazy with it . ”
401729	401754	401717	401717	I	884	“ But going back to the heart of this conversation — why does that have a bearing on a relationship between you and me ? ”
401760	401787	401755	401755	She	8844	“ I freaked out , Hudson . About a guy . Several guys , actually , but it was the last one that ended not well . ”
401795	401811	401788	401788	I	884	“ And do you think you ’re going to ‘ freak out ’ about me ? ”
401915	401959	401960	401960	She	8844	“ I really ca n’t honestly tell you . I ’ve stayed away from any relationship for a while so I would n’t have to deal with it . Trying to have something now with you — it ’s uncharted territory for me . ”
401968	401996	401997	401997	She	8844	“ I have n’t freaked out so far . With you . And I do n’t want to not have sex with you again . I mean … ”
402106	402144	402094	402094	I	884	“ You ’re adorable when you ’re flustered . I do n’t want to not have sex with you again either . So we wo n’t do that . We ’ll have tons of incredible sex instead . ”
402151	402171	402145	402145	She	8844	“ I ’m not saying yes , yet . I have to take this one day at a time . ”
402187	402218	402221	402221	her	8844	“ Alayna , you might have to take this one day at a time , but I already know there will be tons of fucking between the two of us . ”
402241	402261	402238	402238	me	884	“ In fact , I ’m going to have to be inside you again before you leave for work . ”
402276	402281	402262	402262	She	8844	“ Like right now ? ”
402750	402786	402740	402740	I	884	“ I ’m not a slut , Alayna . This loft has been used for sex , yes , but I have it so I can be close to my office , not for fucking . ”
402813	402826	402740	402740	I	884	“ I will be as faithful as I expect you to be . ”
402892	402903	402884	402884	she	8844	“ I ca n’t think about this anymore right now . ”
402917	402923	402904	402904	I	884	“ Why are you panicking ? ”
402957	403017	402946	402946	She	8844	“ You know , it ’s all very good and fine for you to say you want a committed sexual relationship . You ’ll have no problem remaining unemotionally involved — that ’s your default . It ’s not my default . Do n’t you see what you ’re asking of me might be impossible for me to deliver ? ”
403101	403179	403097	403097	she	8844	“ The more we have sex , Hudson , the more I ’m likely to latch on , and even if you were into that , you would n’t be into the level that I latch . So , trust me when I say this has bad idea written all over it . Let ’s call this a wonderful — oh , my God , such a wonderful evening — and now we need to move on . ”
403199	403207	403194	403194	I	884	“ If that ’s what you need . ”
403208	403222	403247	403247	She	5356	“ I do . And I need a shower . Do you mind ? ”
403223	403231	403232	403232	I	884	“ Not at all . In there . ”
403238	403246	403232	403232	I	884	“ I ’ll bring you some towels . ”
403608	403611	403612	403612	She	8844	“ Hudson . ”
403660	403667	403648	403648	I	884	“ Is this what you want ? ”
403668	403671	403672	403672	She	8844	“ Yes ! ”
403675	403685	403672	403672	She	8844	“ I mean , no . I want you . ”
403746	403753	403754	403754	I	884	“ You ’ll have to wait , ”
403758	403766	403754	403754	I	884	“ I ’m enjoying making you wait . ”
403806	403814	403796	403796	she	5360	“ I need to be washed too . ”
404222	404227	404228	404228	I	884	“ Stop fucking teasing , ”
404286	404297	404298	404298	She	442	“ Tell me what you want then , Mr. Pierce ? ”
404344	404358	404359	404359	I	884	“ I want you to fucking suck it . Like a good girl . ”
404367	404371	404372	404372	She	442	“ Open up . ”
404380	404382	404372	404372	She	442	“ O ”
404391	404397	404372	404372	She	442	“ Yeah , like that . ”
404651	404665	404643	404643	she	442	“ Keep up , Christina . Fuck me with your greedy little mouth . ”
404770	404781	404786	404786	she	442	“ That ’s a good bitch . Swallow it all . ”
404836	404856	404829	404829	I	884	“ Very good , Ms. Brooke . I suppose I ’ll have to approve your vacation request after all . ”
404869	404888	404857	404857	She	442	“ Thank you , Mr. Pierce . Is there anything else I can do for you this evening ? ”
404889	404899	404857	404857	She	442	“ I think that ’s all , Ms. Brooke . ”
404971	404992	404993	404993	I	884	“ I have to get back to this boring party . But if I find another chance to get away … ”
404999	405005	405006	405006	She	442	“ Right . Got it . ”
405042	405070	405017	405017	She	442	“ You need to get out there and practice for when you ’re hosting this event . It wo n’t be long now , I ’m sure . ”
405096	405112	405084	405084	He	8755	“ When I ’m in charge , I ’ll own the nightclubs we party at . ”
405160	405166	405167	405167	I	884	“ Smart thinking , boss . ”
405202	405210	405167	405167	I	884	“ Have you heard anything from Celia ? ”
405226	405231	405236	405236	she	442	“ Not since summer . ”
405295	405299	405274	405274	her	442	“ Have you ? ”
405300	405311	405312	405312	Christina	442	“ I went to see her a couple months ago , ”
405332	405339	405323	405323	She	442	“ She was a fucking mess . ”
405345	405353	405323	405323	She	442	“ What do you mean by mess ? ”
405354	405393	405323	405323	She	442	“ Partying . Drugs . She was doing a shit - ton of cocaine when I saw her . And talk about slut — she spread her legs for any guy who gave her the time of day . ”
405428	405434	405435	405435	I	884	“ That ’s too bad . ”
405440	405445	405446	405446	Christina	442	“ Rumor has it , ”
405453	405462	405446	405446	Christina	442	“ that she was nursing a broken heart . ”
405463	405474	405446	405446	Christina	442	“ Are you blaming her self - destruction on me ? ”
405527	405551	405524	405524	Christina	442	“ She ’s a big girl . She ’s responsible for her own destruction . I just thought you ’d want to know . ”
405570	405579	405524	405524	Christina	442	“ She ’s in town for the holiday . ”
405584	405597	405524	405524	Christina	442	“ You know , Hudson ? You ’re kind of an asshole . ”
405605	405615	405580	405580	I	884	“ And you ’re just figuring this out now ? ”
405616	405622	405623	405623	She	442	“ No . I knew . ”
405632	405649	405623	405623	She	442	“ And I still let you fuck me . So obviously I do n’t really care . ”
405701	405720	405694	405694	I	884	“ You should clean yourself up . Have a good Thanksgiving if I do n’t see you again . ”
405936	405958	405926	405926	He	8755	“ Sophia , now how many times have I told you that is n’t the way you play twenty - one ? ”
405998	406028	405982	405983	My mother	442	“ There you are . I was climbing up there to get a better view of the room so I could figure out where you ’d wandered off to . ”
406063	406085	406049	406050	My mother	442	“ Is this the latest ? I should have known . When you disappear , it ’s usually with a tram — ”
406096	406106	406086	406086	I	884	“ Mother , walk with me , will you ? ”
406107	406116	406049	406050	My mother	442	“ And leave him alone with his bi — ”
406125	406149	406150	406150	He	8755	“ It ’s okay , Hudson . Of course you wo n’t be leaving me , sweetheart . I ’m going with you . ”
406499	406508	406509	406510	the clerk	5407	“ Do you want to check your coat ? ”
406539	406585	406528	406528	I	884	“ You ’re too late , Celia . My father just left . But if you want to wait , I think he ’s coming back . He already has a leggy blonde picked out for the evening , though . Do you mind threesomes ? ”
406586	406596	406517	406517	She	9246	“ I ’m not here for Jack , asshole . ”
406609	406628	406597	406597	I	884	“ That ’s too bad . No one else is going to look at you dressed like that . ”
406629	406657	406528	406528	I	884	“ You want to stand around and throw insults at me all night ? Or can you zip it a minute so I can talk to you ? ”
406658	406667	406597	406597	I	884	“ I have nothing to say to you . ”
406668	406684	406528	406528	I	884	“ Awesome . Then you can shut the fuck up and listen while I talk . ”
406706	406728	406695	406695	I	884	“ While that sounds like a whole hell of a lot of fun , Celia , I think I ’ll pass . ”
406737	406740	406741	406741	Her	5411	“ Hudson . ”
406758	406761	406762	406762	she	5411	“ Fine , ”
406772	406780	406762	406762	she	5411	“ I ’ll find your father then . ”
406850	406859	406839	406839	I	884	“ What is it you want , Celia ? ”
406867	406878	406860	406860	Her	5418	“ Not here . We need to be in private . ”
406879	406884	406860	406860	Her	5418	“ I ’m not — ”
406903	406906	406899	406900	my father	8755	“ taking care ”
406940	406943	406937	406937	I	884	“ Stay . ”
407050	407063	407047	407047	Thoreau	478	“ Never look back unless you ’re planning to go that way . ”
407095	407136	407088	407088	I	884	“ You have three minutes . Then I ’m taking you out to the curb and putting you in a cab . I ’ll even give you some cash , if that ’s how you ’re used to getting paid . ”
407147	407156	407137	407137	Her	9246	“ Did I mention fuck you , Hudson ? ”
407157	407172	407173	407173	I	884	“ I do n’t get off on my father ’s sloppy seconds . Sorry . ”
407181	407193	407173	407173	I	884	“ And now you ’re at two minutes forty - five . ”
407211	407228	407194	407194	She	9246	“ I ’m willing to bet that I ’ll have your attention for longer than that . ”
407237	407242	407234	407234	my	884	“ Two minutes forty . ”
407243	407254	407194	407194	She	9246	“ I knew I should have talked to Jack instead . ”
407303	407312	407292	407292	I	884	“ What the fuck is it , Celia ? ”
407323	407328	407313	407313	She	9246	“ I ’m pregnant . ”
407408	407452	407395	407395	she	9246	“ Are you trying to figure out if I ’m lying ? Oh , my God . I can prove it if you need me to . Trust me , pregnancy is not something I ’d be able to lie about for long . ”
407496	407504	407488	407488	I	884	“ You ’re sure it ’s his ? ”
407514	407523	407505	407505	She	9246	“ I did n’t sleep around , Hudson . ”
407524	407532	407533	407533	I	884	“ That ’s not what I heard . ”
407549	407560	407545	407545	Celia	9246	“ Actually heard you were quite the slut these days . ”
407561	407576	407577	407577	She	9246	“ From who ? From Christina ? And you believed that fucking whore cunt ? ”
407588	407614	407577	407577	She	9246	“ Whatever . Fine . Yes , I was a little wild this semester . Before I found out I was pregnant . After you . ”
407636	407671	407632	407632	She	9246	“ After Jack , rather . But the timing is … It ’s your father ’s , Hudson . There ’s no one else that fits the time frame . And the condom broke . ”
407672	407681	407682	407682	I	884	“ I do n’t want to hear that . ”
407723	407731	407737	407737	her	9246	“ I ’m sure you do n’t . ”
407740	407752	407737	407737	her	9246	“ But you get to hear it because I blame you . ”
407758	407770	407754	407754	I	884	“ For faulty birth control ? Or for your bad decision ? ”
407771	407799	407737	407737	her	9246	“ Oh , do n’t even play like you have no comprehension of your culpability . You drove me to him . You gave me no choice . ”
407800	407812	407754	407754	I	884	“ Pathetic , Celia . Take responsibility for your own actions . ”
407813	407836	407837	407837	She	9246	“ I am . That ’s why I ’m here . Now it ’s your turn to take responsibility for your actions . ”
407844	407855	407837	407837	She	9246	“ And tell me what we ’re going to do . ”
407856	407870	407837	407837	She	9246	“ What we ’re going to do ? This is not my problem . ”
407915	407945	407912	407912	Celia	9246	“ Then I ’ll take it to your father . I ’m sure he ’ll step up . He ’ll have no choice when I get a DNA test . ”
408001	408004	407991	407991	I	884	“ Fuck . ”
408020	408028	408012	408012	Celia	9246	“ What do you want from me ? ”
408040	408051	408029	408029	She	9246	“ I want you to tell me what to do ! ”
408091	408097	408081	408081	I	884	“ What are our options ? ”
408121	408124	408125	408125	She	442	“ Well . ”
408153	408185	408147	408147	I	884	“ I ’m not having an abortion . I might have been able to , but I saw the ultrasound . I saw its heartbeat . I ca n’t do that . ”
408186	408191	408192	408192	I	884	“ So no abortion . ”
408222	408230	408231	408231	She	442	“ I ’m not opposed to adoption . ”
408280	408289	408290	408290	She	442	“ My mom will want to keep it . ”
408297	408332	408290	408290	She	442	“ Can you just see my mother as a doting grandmother ? Either way , my parents will want to know who the father is . My father would kill me if he knew . ”
408333	408345	408346	408347	My father	700	“ More like he ’d kill my father if he knew . ”
408364	408380	408361	408361	Celia	9246	“ Let ’s just say it would n’t be good for either one of us . ”
408381	408388	408391	408392	my mother	245	“ It would destroy my mother . ”
408394	408401	408391	408392	my mother	245	“ And my brother and sister . ”
408409	408419	408402	408402	She	9246	“ I ca n’t tell him it ’s Jack . ”
408448	408457	408458	408458	I	884	“ You ’ll tell him it ’s me . ”
408463	408471	408458	408458	I	884	“ Tell him I ’m the father . ”
408472	408475	408476	408476	She	9246	“ What ? ”
408493	408504	408476	408476	She	9246	“ Are you really … would you really do that ? ”
408517	408525	408529	408529	her	9246	“ Now you ’re the one pretending . ”
408534	408560	408529	408529	her	9246	“ You came to me because you knew I ’d offer . Do n’t even fucking try to convince me you did n’t plan this . ”
408561	408565	408566	408566	she	9246	“ I hoped , ”
408569	408588	408566	408566	she	9246	“ Not that I ’d get pregnant . But after I did , I hoped you ’d offer . ”
408589	408596	408597	408597	I	884	“ Finally we ’re getting somewhere . ”
408614	408630	408607	408607	I	884	“ Then that ’s what we ’ll do . We ’ll say it ’s mine . ”
408639	408703	408607	408607	I	884	“ You can finish this semester . Come back at Christmas and I ’ll go with you to the parenting classes or whatever . I ’ll play the supportive sperm donor . If you choose to keep it , I ’ll set up a trust fund or something . Dad ’s money will be my money anyway when I take over the company . ”
408704	408707	408708	408708	She	5436	“ Okay . ”
408714	408719	408708	408708	She	5436	“ What about fathering ? ”
408720	408731	408708	408708	She	5436	“ You want me to have a relationship with it ? ”
408732	408750	408708	408708	She	5436	“ Do n’t talk like it ’s a stranger . It will be your brother or sister . ”
408751	408754	408755	408755	I	884	“ Right . ”
408809	408845	408802	408802	my	884	“ Sure . Fine . Minimal relationship though . I do n’t want custody . But that also means I get to help make parenting decisions . Are you going to be okay with that ? ”
408857	408865	408849	408849	she	5436	“ I ’ll be okay with whatever . ”
408874	408887	408849	408849	she	5436	“ I do n’t even know if I ’m keeping it yet . ”
408894	408903	408904	408904	I	884	“ I ’m not marrying you , Celia . ”
408911	408921	408904	408904	I	884	“ This in no way makes us a couple . ”
408930	408940	408922	408922	She	5436	“ I never thought for a moment it did . ”
408966	408989	408957	408957	she	5436	“ Nor would I ever expect it . You , I ’ve discovered , are incapable of anything remotely like a relationship . ”
409021	409028	409013	409013	I	884	“ I ’m glad you know . ”
409074	409083	409069	409069	she	5436	“ Hudson , why are you doing this ? ”
409417	409420	409421	409421	Celia	9246	“ Hudson ? ”
409435	409440	409441	409441	I	884	“ I heard you . ”
409450	409455	409441	409441	I	884	“ The family name . ”
409474	409492	409470	409470	I	884	“ Pierce is my legacy . I would n’t want it poisoned by my father ’s mistakes . ”
409514	409542	409508	409508	I	884	“ Let ’s give our families Thanksgiving . We can tell them on Friday . I ’ll call you tomorrow to arrange the details of our announcement . ”
409576	409583	409567	409567	I	884	“ I ’ll walk you out . ”
409612	409615	409594	409594	she	9246	“ Hudson ? ”
409621	409624	409616	409616	I	884	“ What ? ”
409625	409629	409630	409630	Her	9246	“ Thank you . ”
409737	409742	409743	409743	I	884	“ Congratulations , Ceeley , ”
409746	409755	409743	409743	I	884	“ Everything ’s going to be just fine . "
410100	410115	410120	410120	me	884	“ Oh , you do n’t need to be all PDA on my account , ”
410122	410128	410120	410120	me	884	“ Remember , I know . ”
410237	410242	410243	410243	she	8844	“ I ’m Celia , ”
410248	410269	410243	410243	she	8844	“ I thought we should probably meet . Though it does n’t look like Hudson ’s too keen on it . ”
410321	410332	410333	410333	I	884	“ No , you ’re right . You should meet . ”
410347	410353	410333	410333	I	884	“ Now you ’ve met . ”
410354	410368	410369	410369	Celia	9246	“ You are n’t getting rid of me that easily , you oaf . ”
410377	410388	410372	410372	She	9246	“ Believe it or not , we ’re actually friends . ”
410480	410488	410474	410474	I	884	“ What do you want , Ceeley ? ”
410511	410523	410529	410529	Celia	9246	“ I wanted to personally thank Alayna for this whole charade . ”
410566	410585	410586	410586	she	8844	“ You ca n’t know how dreadful the idea of marrying that pain in the ass has been , ”
410599	410615	410593	410593	Alayna	8844	“ Um , I can imagine . He ’s not the settling - down type . ”
410660	410663	410664	410664	Celia	9246	“ Wow , ”
410667	410675	410664	410664	Celia	9246	“ You already know him so well . ”
410676	410688	410689	410689	Alayna	8844	“ It ’s nice to talk to someone else who knows , ”
410692	410702	410703	410703	Celia	9246	“ But is n’t Hudson amazingly good at pretending ? ”
410744	410751	410737	410737	Alayna	8844	“ He is . Quite good . ”
410795	410818	410819	410819	I	884	“ I ’d love to continue this wonderfully entertaining conversation , but I see someone I need to talk some business with . ”
410827	410830	410819	410819	I	884	“ Alayna ? ”
410836	410847	410831	410831	She	8844	“ Go ahead , H. I ’ll hang with Celia . ”
410848	410854	410855	410855	Celia	9246	“ We ’ll be fine , ”
410858	410877	410855	410855	Celia	9246	“ And we ’ll end our conversation with a pretend catfight if you want to up the charade . ”
410908	410923	410902	410902	I	884	“ No catfight . In my script , you ’re friendly toward each other . ”
410924	410942	410943	410943	Celia	9246	“ Then she and I should sit and chat , since we ’re supposed to be friends . ”
410956	410961	410943	410943	Celia	9246	“ Right , Alayna ? ”
410962	410965	410966	410966	Alayna	8844	“ Right . ”
410971	410984	410966	410966	Alayna	8844	“ And since we ’re friends , you should call me Laynie . ”
411020	411026	411027	411027	I	884	“ Friendly , not friends . ”
411038	411047	411027	411027	I	884	“ Fine . I ’ll be back shortly . ”
411471	411477	411461	411461	I	884	“ Where are you going ? ”
411485	411491	411478	411478	She	442	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
411492	411495	411496	411496	I	884	“ Whoa . ”
411548	411555	411542	411542	I	884	“ What ’s wrong with you ? ”
411556	411569	411570	411570	Alayna	8844	“ What ’s wrong with you would be the more appropriate question . ”
411578	411581	411582	411582	I	884	“ Alayna . ”
411591	411622	411582	411582	I	884	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , but you ’re making a scene . You need to calm down and save whatever this is for later . ”
411635	411648	411631	411631	she	442	“ There is n’t going to be a later — I quit . ”
411658	411661	411662	411662	I	884	“ Alayna ! ”
411755	411788	411818	411818	Celia	9246	“ Tell me , Hudson , did you pick me because you thought my obsession issues would make your game more fun ? Because really , where ’s the challenge in that ? ”
411799	411807	411823	411823	she	9246	“ Fuck Celia and her big mouth . ”
411857	411867	411845	411845	I	884	“ Let ’s talk about this in the limo . ”
411868	411874	411841	411841	She	9246	“ I do n’t want — ”
411875	411901	411902	411902	I	884	“ Alayna . It ’s not fair of you to listen to a stranger tell her story and not give me a chance to explain . ”
411914	411980	411911	411911	I	884	“ I ’m telling you we will talk about this in the limo which is parked in the lot next door . First , because my mother is watching , I ’m going to bend down and kiss your forehead . Then I ’m going to walk over and tell her that you are n’t feeling well . I will meet you in the car . ”
412033	412039	412040	412040	I	884	“ The limo , Alayna , ”
412043	412050	412040	412040	I	884	“ I ’ll meet you there . ”
412092	412105	412088	412088	I	884	“ Trouble with your plaything already ? That did n’t last long . ”
412127	412165	412116	412116	Celia	9246	“ Alayna ’s not feeling well . She has n’t built up a tolerance to the poison in this environment like the rest of us have . I ’m taking her home and putting her to bed . ”
412177	412193	412166	412166	I	884	“ I ’ll be back in time to present your precious Pierce Industries donation check . ”
412281	412300	412276	412276	I	884	“ Jordan , drive around until I say otherwise . Or find someplace to park for a while . ”
412459	412467	412446	412446	I	884	“ What exactly did Celia tell you ? ”
412468	412485	412515	412515	she	9246	“ Oh , just how you fuck with vulnerable women ’s emotions . Is it true ? ”
412542	412545	412546	412546	I	884	“ Alayna — ”
412579	412595	412573	412573	she	9246	“ Do n’t touch me ! And stop saying my name . Is it true ? ”
412596	412606	412573	412573	she	9246	“ Will you calm down so I can explain ? ”
412651	412658	412659	412659	she	9246	“ Is . It . True ? ”
412673	412680	412642	412642	she	9246	“ Yes , it ’s true ! ”
412713	412722	412702	412702	I	884	“ In the past , it was true . ”
412765	412778	412758	412758	I	884	“ I did ... things ... that I ’m not proud of . ”
412786	412801	412758	412758	I	884	“ I manipulated people . I hurt them , and often it was deliberate . ”
412886	412902	412878	412878	I	884	“ But not now . I do n’t do that now . Not with you . ”
412914	412960	412910	412910	She	9246	“ Really ? Because it seems completely obvious that you did exactly that with me . The way you picked me out at the symposium , and you tracked me down and gave me a spa vacation , and Jesus , you bought the club ! ”
412966	412987	412961	412961	I	884	“ It ’s not like that . I explained the gift , and I was looking at the club anyway . ”
412999	413017	412961	412961	I	884	“ When I found out you worked there , yes , it helped me make my decision — ”
413023	413068	413018	413018	She	5490	“ And you ‘ hired ’ me and seduced me . And when I told you I needed to not have sex with you , you somehow got me to do exactly that . You are manipulative . You ’re a bully , Hudson . ”
413103	413116	413121	413121	she	5490	“ No , Alayna . I did n’t want that with you . ”
413165	413177	413209	413209	She	5490	“ I do n’t want to be like that with you . ”
413195	413208	413209	413209	She	5490	“ Then what do you want to be with me , Hudson ? ”
413229	413237	413209	413209	She	5490	“ Honestly ? I ’m not sure . ”
413429	413486	413416	413416	I	884	“ I ’m drawn to you , Alayna . Not because I want to hurt you or make you feel a certain way , but because you ’re beautiful and sexy and smart and , yes , a little crazy maybe , but you ’re not broken . And that makes me hopeful . For me . ”
413609	413645	413604	413604	I	884	“ And maybe I ’ve been a bully . But I ’m a dominant person . I can try to change things about me , but the fundamentals of my personality are never going away . ”
413668	413680	413655	413655	I	884	“ You of all people should be able to understand that . ”
413681	413686	413687	413687	Her	9246	“ I ’m sorry . ”
413691	413706	413687	413687	Her	9246	“ I ’m sorry . You did n’t judge me and I judged you . ”
413779	413813	413772	413772	She	9246	“ And I exaggerated when I called you a bully . I have n’t done anything I did n’t want to . And your whole confident , domineering thing is actually kinda hot . ”
413856	413868	413870	413870	I	884	“ Alayna , do n’t quit . Do n’t quit me . ”
413932	413973	413921	413921	She	9246	“ Hudson , I have to . Not because of this , well , not only because of this , but because of my past . I ’m not well enough to be with someone who has his own issues . ”
413974	413991	413994	413994	me	884	“ You are , Alayna . You only tell that to yourself because you ’re scared . ”
414008	414031	413994	413994	me	884	“ I should be scared . It ’s not safe . For either of us . You should be scared , too . ”
414119	414144	414112	414112	I	884	“ I do n’t believe that . I think spending time with another person who has similar compulsive tendencies can provide insight and healing . ”
414240	414246	414247	414247	Her	9246	“ I wo n’t quit . ”
414261	414290	414255	414255	She	9246	“ But I ca n’t have a relationship with you , Hudson . All I can give you is the fake . I have to protect myself here . ”
414297	414301	414291	414291	I	884	“ I understand . ”
414316	414320	414312	414312	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
414362	414370	414351	414351	she	9246	“ Hudson , you ’re not broken . ”
414392	414402	414405	414405	she	9246	“ What are you ... ? Is that ... ? ”
414450	414460	414447	414447	She	9246	“ Yes . I ’d worn it for you . ”
414461	414474	414447	414447	She	9246	“ Wow . That was … that was very thoughtful of you . ”
414568	414573	414574	414574	she	9246	“ I ’m sorry , ”
414587	414595	414579	414579	she	9246	“ I know . I am too . ”
414639	414658	414633	414633	I	884	“ This may be poor timing , but I need to get back to my mother ’s show . ”
414659	414662	414618	414618	she	9246	“ Sure . ”
414663	414680	414633	414633	I	884	“ And since you ’re supposed to be sick , you will need to go home . ”
414734	414743	414744	414744	she	9246	“ When is our next show , boss ? ”
414816	414830	414831	414831	I	884	“ I ’m not sure . I have to fly to Cincinnati tonight . ”
414834	414842	414831	414831	I	884	“ And I am not your boss . ”
414843	414848	414849	414849	She	9246	“ Cincinnati ? Tonight ? ”
414853	414875	414876	414877	My mother	442	“ Yes , tonight . I have a meeting first thing in the morning . My jet ’s leaving early evening . ”
414899	414916	414890	414890	I	884	“ I ’ll text you later to arrange the Hamptons . We ’ll leave Friday afternoon . ”
414917	414926	414960	414960	she	442	“ So you ’ll be gone all week ? ”
414927	414934	414935	414935	I	884	“ I ’m not sure yet . ”
414968	414971	414972	414972	She	442	“ Oh . ”
415075	415096	415069	415069	she	442	“ Thank you for today . I think you ’ve truly made an impression on my mother . Good work . ”
415309	415317	415304	415304	I	884	“ What the fuck did you do ? ”
415332	415358	415325	415325	She	9246	“ Oh , chill out . I had n’t had a chance to get to know our subject . I was simply feeling her out . ”
415373	415380	415381	415381	Her	9246	“ You told her my secrets . ”
415417	415440	415408	415408	I	884	“ You practically ruined your own scheme by telling her something that we are n’t even supposed to talk about . Ever ! ”
415492	415505	415484	415484	Celia	9246	“ Wow , Hudson . You ’re angry . I ’m impressed . ”
415564	415574	415551	415551	I	884	“ I get angry . This is n’t new . ”
415585	415603	415604	415604	She	9246	“ You never get this angry . If you do , you do n’t let it show . ”
415620	415633	415604	415604	She	9246	“ Did that therapist of yours finally teach you how to feel ? ”
415713	415738	415701	415701	I	884	“ I ’m just … out of practice at this . And you ’re changing the rules without consulting me . I ’m frustrated . ”
415745	415751	415752	415752	She	9246	“ Understandable , I suppose . ”
415760	415786	415752	415752	She	9246	“ But I did n’t change the rules . I saw a flaw in our scenario and I improvised . Same as we always do . ”
415797	415801	415787	415787	I	884	“ What flaw ? ”
415811	415851	415805	415805	she	9246	“ The girl is doe - eyed about you , Hudson . It ’s obvious she ’s going to fall apart over you , and while that ’s the expectation , this was going to be entirely too easy . ”
415860	415872	415852	415852	She	9246	“ So I injected a little challenge . That ’s all . ”
415905	415922	415888	415888	Celia	9246	“ Making the experiment more challenging ? Since when was that something we ’d aspired to ? ”
415926	415946	415923	415923	She	9246	“ This is your first game in a long time . I wanted to make it good for you . ”
416027	416043	416020	416020	I	884	“ That was quite a risk you took . She almost quit the whole thing . ”
416050	416059	416044	416044	Celia	9246	“ But she did n’t . Did she ? ”
416060	416082	416092	416092	her	9246	“ Only because I convinced her not to . If it had n’t been for me , she would be gone . ”
416128	416148	416113	416113	Celia	9246	“ If it had n’t been for you , she would n’t be so enamored in the first place . ”
416149	416157	416113	416113	Celia	9246	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
416158	416175	416113	416113	Celia	9246	“ Just that the scheme would have worked more objectively if you had n’t fucked her . ”
416204	416215	416243	416243	she	9246	“ You ’ve never cared if I fucked them before . ”
416216	416231	416232	416232	She	9246	“ And I still do n’t . Except when it messes with the hypothesis . ”
416249	416286	416243	416243	she	9246	“ Your extracurricular activities are your own business . Keep up your fun if you prefer . But realize that what you do with Alayna Withers outside our plan has the power to affect the outcome . ”
416287	416312	416313	416313	I	884	“ It ’s a little late for that sentiment . You ’ve effectively ended any extracurricular activities , as you like to call it . ”
416423	416476	416408	416408	She	9246	“ I ’m sorry , Hudson . I really am . I probably should n’t have intervened as I did . I just know that you have faith that Alayna will come out of this strong , and with the road you had chosen , that was simply not going to happen . ”
416492	416510	416477	416477	She	9246	“ I did it for you . To give your thesis a fighting chance . Forgive me ? ”
416586	416633	416579	416579	I	884	“ Do n’t pretend this was for me , Celia . You forget I know you . You wanted to make the game more challenging — well , you did just that . Good luck with the rest of this going the way you ’d like . ”
416646	416661	416641	416641	she	9246	“ The symphony on Thursday ? It ’s still our next outing , correct ? ”
416685	416701	416682	416683	my partner	293	“ I ’ll see what I can do , but I ’m making no promises . ”
416814	416825	416807	416807	I	884	“ Thanks for the coffee . And for everything else . ”
417232	417235	417238	417238	her	9246	“ Alayna . ”
417349	417366	417343	417343	I	884	“ Gentlemen , my girlfriend has decided to surprise me with a visit to my office . ”
417436	417445	417423	417423	I	884	“ What are you doing here , Alayna ? ”
417511	417525	417499	417499	she	9246	“ I , uh , I wanted to see if you were back . ”
417539	417555	417499	417499	she	9246	“ I got back late last night . You could have called . Or texted . ”
417578	417586	417499	417499	she	9246	“ You do n’t answer my texts . ”
417587	417595	417499	417499	she	9246	“ I did n’t answer one text . ”
417603	417610	417600	417600	her	9246	“ It was my only text . ”
417694	417717	417691	417691	I	884	“ I did n’t realize it was important to you . I ’ll make a better effort to respond in the future . ”
417748	417785	417740	417740	I	884	“ But you ca n’t just come here like this . How do you think it looks to have my girlfriend wandering around the lobby , riding the elevators when I ’m not even in town ? ”
417786	417792	417849	417849	Her	5548	“ How did you … ? ”
417793	417803	417740	417740	I	884	“ I pay people to know things , Alayna . ”
417808	417820	417740	417740	I	884	“ I … I’m sorry . I could n’t help myself . ”
417821	417830	417831	417831	I	884	“ Please , do n’t do it again . ”
417855	417863	417849	417849	Her	5548	“ Why are you being like this ? ”
417864	417868	417869	417869	I	884	“ Like what ? ”
417908	417942	417903	417903	she	5548	“ I ’ve fucked things up , Hudson ! You should be calling your security to escort me out . I ’m a mess , and you ’re taking it all in stride . ”
417954	417957	417943	417943	I	884	“ No . ”
417967	417998	417943	417943	I	884	“ That ’s what I meant about being around someone who understands . I know about compulsion . I know about having to do things you know you should n’t . ”
418024	418039	418005	418005	I	884	“ When you feel you ca n’t help yourself , talk to me first . ”
418129	418140	418120	418121	my secretary	4844	“ Mr. Pierce , your one - thirty is here . ”
418176	418201	418167	418167	I	884	“ I apologize for cutting this short , Alayna , but I have another meeting now . And I ’m leaving again this evening . ”
418228	418244	418225	418225	she	8844	“ I hate that you ’re leaving . It makes me feel a little distraught . ”
418263	418270	418245	418245	I	884	“ I ’ll be back tomorrow . ”
418276	418285	418271	418271	I	884	“ Join me tomorrow night for the symphony . ”
418346	418353	418342	418342	her	8844	“ Are you thinking of me ? ”
418362	418365	418354	418354	I	884	“ Always . ”
418584	418589	418574	418574	I	884	“ Where are you ? ”
418611	418616	418608	418608	I	884	“ Right beside you . ”
418780	418786	418787	418787	he	245	“ Ah , young love , ”
418790	418814	418787	418787	he	245	“ I remember when I could n’t stand being without Madge . In fact , forget young — I still feel that way . ”
419153	419163	419164	419164	she	9246	“ You ’ve backed off . I ’m impressed , ”
419170	419177	419178	419178	I	884	“ I could say the same . ”
419402	419412	419397	419397	she	8844	“ So you knew Celia would be there tonight . ”
419423	419436	419437	419437	I	884	“ I knew Celia would be there with her parents , yes . ”
419450	419463	419437	419437	I	884	“ Her parents , whom are friends with my parents , remember . ”
419501	419506	419483	419483	She	8844	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
419547	419552	419553	419553	she	9246	“ I want you , ”
419572	419575	419559	419559	She	9246	“ Alayna ? ”
419576	419583	419584	419584	She	9246	“ I know what I said . ”
419589	419633	419634	419634	She	9246	“ But maybe I was wrong . I mean , I do n’t know if you ’re right — if spending time with you can make me better . But I know that since we ’ve been apart , I ’ve been worse . ”
419659	419664	419665	419665	She	9246	“ I miss you . ”
419668	419675	419665	419665	She	9246	“ Told you I get attached . ”
419729	419739	419722	419722	I	884	“ Where do you think I ’m taking you ? ”
419767	419770	419764	419764	her	9246	“ Oh . ”
419778	419797	419798	419798	Irritation	481	“ I told you no more sex , and you were taking me to the loft without asking ? ”
419805	419808	419809	419809	I	884	“ Alayna , ”
419823	419841	419819	419819	She	9246	“ You are a bundle of mixed signals . At the symphony , you seemed to indicate — ”
419842	419859	419877	419877	she	9246	“ And you totally blew me off . Do n’t talk to me about mixed signals ! ”
419887	419906	419879	419879	I	884	“ I was trying to avoid mixing business with pleasure . A difficult task with you , precious . ”
419936	419951	419930	419930	I	884	“ Especially with your wandering hands and how hot you look in that dress . ”
419955	419958	419952	419952	She	9246	“ Oh . ”
419959	419979	419980	419980	She	9246	“ If you want me to ask , I will , though you know it ’s not my style . ”
419999	420010	419989	419989	I	884	“ May I take you to my bed , Alayna ? ”
420011	420014	420015	420015	she	9246	“ Yes , ”
420236	420250	420225	420225	I	884	“ God , Alayna . That ’s so … ah … so good . ”
420409	420416	420417	420417	she	9246	“ Did I do something wrong ? ”
420451	420461	420462	420462	I	884	“ No , precious . Your mouth is amazing . ”
420480	420499	420462	420462	I	884	“ But I need to come inside your cunt . I ’ve been thinking about it for days . ”
420685	420692	420693	420693	I	884	“ So … damn … good , ”
420697	420707	420693	420693	I	884	“ You feel … so … damn … good . ”
420769	420776	420777	420777	I	884	“ Come with me , Alayna , ”
420780	420783	420777	420777	I	884	“ Come . ”
420965	420972	420956	420956	We	5585	“ Can we do that again ? ”
421006	421027	420988	420988	I	884	“ You have to be at work at one ? I think we can manage to do that again twice . ”
421085	421091	421079	421079	I	884	“ Water or iced tea ? ”
421098	421103	421079	421079	I	884	“ Water , please . ”
421195	421206	421188	421188	She	9246	“ Could you really do that ? Go again twice ? ”
421207	421213	421214	421214	I	884	“ What do you think ? ”
421249	421260	421242	421242	Her	9246	“ I think you ’d like to think you can . ”
421265	421282	421283	421283	I	884	“ You do n’t have to challenge me to get me to prove it , precious . ”
421290	421295	421296	421296	Her	9246	“ Oh , really ? ”
421349	421360	421361	421361	I	884	“ Be careful who you ’re playing with , Alayna . ”
421367	421385	421361	421361	I	884	“ I assure you , I ’m the one who will come out of this on top . ”
421459	421468	421449	421449	I	884	“ Why did you decide to resume this ? ”
421479	421483	421484	421484	She	9246	“ The sex ? ”
421493	421501	421484	421484	She	9246	“ Well , besides the obvious reason — ”
421502	421506	421484	421484	She	9246	“ Which is ? ”
421507	421512	421513	421513	Her	9246	“ It ’s fun . ”
421517	421527	421513	421513	Her	9246	“ Yes , you ’re right . Quite obvious . ”
421544	421548	421537	421537	I	884	“ And … ? ”
421568	421574	421575	421575	she	9246	“ And I trust you , ”
421725	421729	421722	421722	I	884	“ Go on . ”
421730	421733	421734	421734	She	9246	“ Well … ”
421782	421790	421791	421791	she	9246	“ You said you were different now , ”
421795	421839	421791	421791	she	9246	“ Different with me . And I realized that it does n’t matter if it ’s crazy or stupid to believe it . Because I believe it anyway . I believe you . I trust you . About this , I trust you . ”
422578	422591	422592	422593	my mother	442	“ I do n’t see any diamond ring size boxes under here , ”
422648	422672	422689	422689	She	442	“ There ’s not going to be a ring , Mother . I ’m not marrying Celia . I ’ve told you that . ”
422673	422688	422689	422689	She	442	“ I keep hoping you ’re trying to surprise me with a Christmas engagement . ”
422720	422732	422733	422733	She	442	“ I really wish I ’d known what color to buy . ”
422741	422761	422733	422733	She	442	“ I saved all the receipts though . In case you and Celia get sick of green and yellow . ”
422910	422932	422903	422903	I	884	“ I ’m so glad Celia ’s not going back to school next semester . I wish you were staying here . ”
422959	422985	422952	422952	I	884	“ Boston is n’t far . I ’ll come up for every prenatal exam . I ’ll make sure I ’m here for the birth . ”
422986	423007	422903	422903	I	884	“ That ’s what you keep saying . But labor can come on quickly . What if you missed it ? ”
423124	423167	423112	423112	Sophia	1858	“ You know , we do n’t have to wait until after Christmas for the gender reveal ultrasound . We could probably get in with one of those 3D ultrasound places . Should I call Celia and arrange it ? My treat . ”
423168	423171	423172	423172	I	884	“ No . ”
423185	423202	423172	423172	I	884	“ Madge does n’t trust those things . She wants to wait for her scheduled exam . ”
423203	423212	423172	423172	I	884	“ We do n’t have to tell Madge . ”
423213	423239	423172	423172	I	884	“ Even if you are capable of keeping a secret from Madge , I do n’t think Celia would want to go without her mother . ”
423240	423256	423257	423258	My mother	442	“ What I do n’t understand is why you ’re not more excited about it ? ”
423277	423291	423268	423268	she	442	“ It ’s your first child , Hudson . Take some more pride . ”
423408	423415	423416	423416	I	884	“ I ’m not very expressive , ”
423426	423437	423416	423416	I	884	“ It does n’t mean I do n’t feel things . ”
423469	423487	423461	423461	She	442	“ I ’m glad to hear that , Hudson . I used to worry you did n’t . ”
423515	423523	423504	423504	I	884	“ What exactly worried you , Mother ? ”
423524	423533	423534	423534	She	442	“ You , Hudson . You worried me . ”
423545	423563	423534	423534	She	442	“ Do you remember when you were twelve and you had those entrance exams for Choice Hill ? ”
423612	423622	423623	423623	She	442	“ One of the psychologists that worked with you — ”
423645	423706	423639	423639	she	442	“ His name escapes me , but anyway , he suggested that you struggled with emotions . He recommended we had you tested further to rule out sociopathic tendencies or schizoid personality disorder or Asperger ’s Syndrome . Because you had a blunted affect . Or experience avoidance . Or something like that . I do n’t remember the terms . ”
423726	423737	423719	423719	I	884	“ But I do n’t remember being tested for anything . ”
423738	423763	423639	423639	she	442	“ Oh , no . You made it into the school , so we did n’t see any reason to pursue the issue further . ”
423773	423781	423782	423782	I	884	“ I made it into the school , ”
423785	423809	423782	423782	I	884	“ and so you did n’t see any reason to find out if your child might be suffering from a major psychological disorder ? ”
423815	423832	423810	423810	She	5628	“ Do n’t act like it ’s such a big deal . You ’re obviously fine . ”
423970	423973	423969	423969	her	8319	“ hello , ”
424004	424007	423999	423999	I	884	“ blunted affect ”
424056	424061	424062	424062	she	8319	“ Okay . Okay , ”
424069	424083	424062	424062	she	8319	“ We ’ll be there . We ’re coming . See you soon . ”
424100	424109	424089	424089	I	884	“ Hudson . Hudson . Oh , no . ”
424162	424168	424169	424169	she	8319	“ It ’s the baby , ”
424175	424193	424169	424169	she	8319	“ Celia ’s losing the baby . She ’s at the hospital . We have to go . ”
424516	424522	424523	424523	Celia	9246	“ Why are you here ? ”
424545	424550	424532	424532	I	884	“ You ’re awake . ”
424551	424555	424556	424556	She	442	“ I am . ”
424571	424590	424591	424591	Her	442	“ And you do n’t need to be here . The façade is over . You can go . ”
424600	424606	424591	424591	Her	442	“ I ’m not leaving . ”
424607	424610	424591	424591	Her	442	“ Why ? ”
424615	424621	424611	424611	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
424675	424681	424669	424669	I	884	“ How do you feel ? ”
424687	424690	424682	424682	She	442	“ Numb . ”
424699	424704	424695	424695	I	884	“ That ’s natural . ”
424705	424709	424682	424682	She	442	“ Is it ? ”
424722	424736	424737	424737	She	442	“ I do n’t really know , Celia . I assume it is . ”
424750	424770	424746	424746	I	884	“ I imagine it ’s some sort of defense mechanism to the trauma . Do they know what happened ? ”
424780	424863	424771	424771	She	442	“ One of the doctors told me — in private , when my parents were n’t in the room — that there appeared to be developmental issues . I asked if it could have been because….because I ’d partied early on . I , uh , drank a lot . And there was drug use . Before I knew I was pregnant , of course . He said that he could n’t be sure , but it was probably a contributing factor . ”
425088	425093	425083	425083	Celia	9246	“ I ’m sorry . ”
425094	425100	425107	425107	her	442	“ Why are you sorry ? ”
425127	425164	425115	425115	She	442	“ You are n’t really the father , but I feel like I need to say this to someone . So I ’m telling you I ’m sorry . I ’m sorry I killed our baby . ”
425259	425276	425252	425252	she	9246	“ It was fun for a moment , was n’t it ? Pretending it was ours . ”
425362	425374	425375	425375	She	9246	“ I feel like I understand you better now , Hudson . ”
425389	425404	425375	425375	She	9246	“ Why you play those games . Why you played that game with me . ”
425423	425427	425420	425420	I	884	“ What game ? ”
425443	425464	425428	425428	She	9246	“ Let ’s not do that right now , Hudson . Please ? Be honest with me for a minute . ”
425542	425548	425535	425535	I	884	“ They are n’t games . ”
425549	425555	425556	425556	She	9246	“ What are they then ? ”
425587	425592	425593	425593	I	884	“ They ’re experiments . ”
425606	425614	425615	425615	Blip	485	“ I don’t … understand … people . ”
425619	425630	425631	425631	Blip	485	“ What makes them feel . I experiment to understand . ”
425633	425640	425641	425641	Blip	485	“ You do n’t feel things ? ”
425652	425667	425668	425668	Blip	485	“ I do n’t think I do . Not the way most people do . ”
425670	425676	425668	425668	Blip	485	“ That explains a lot . ”
425682	425686	425677	425677	I	884	“ Does it ? ”
425687	425693	425694	425694	She	9246	“ Yeah . It does . ”
425731	425743	425720	425720	She	9246	“ You ’ve done it with more than just me then ? ”
425749	425755	425744	425744	I	884	“ Have you learned anything ? ”
425756	425763	425720	425720	She	9246	“ I ’ve learned a lot . ”
425764	425773	425774	425774	She	9246	“ But you still do n’t feel things ? ”
425780	425785	425786	425786	I	884	“ I do n’t . ”
425799	425844	425786	425786	I	884	“ I do n’t think that ’s something that will ever change . It ’s not why I do it . If anything , the more I experiment , the less I feel . Except with you . You … I do n’t know . ”
425864	425885	425856	425856	I	884	“ You ’re too much like family , I think . So I have … I did feel … something . ”
425886	425895	425919	425919	She	9246	“ You do n’t know what , though ? ”
425896	425899	425900	425900	I	884	“ No . ”
425911	425918	425900	425900	I	884	“ Obligation , maybe . Responsibility . ”
425934	425946	425919	425919	She	9246	“ But with the others , you did n’t feel anything ? ”
425947	425950	425977	425977	God	8844	“ No . ”
425968	425976	425951	425951	She	9246	“ Do you ever feel anything else ? ”
426015	426024	426004	426004	I	884	“ Not really . Anger sometimes . Disgust . ”
426025	426031	426039	426039	I	884	“ You ’re never happy ? ”
426032	426038	426039	426039	I	884	“ I ’m often content . ”
426074	426079	426099	426099	she	9246	“ What about sorrow ? ”
426080	426087	426088	426088	I	884	“ It ’s more like disappointment . ”
426105	426115	426099	426099	she	9246	“ Right now , I ’m disappointed for you . ”
426248	426254	426255	426255	She	9246	“ Very disappointed for you . ”
426270	426281	426255	426255	She	9246	“ What about guilt ? Or compassion ? Or love ? ”
426287	426298	426282	426282	I	884	“ You do n’t love your mother ? Or Mirabelle ? ”
426299	426305	426282	426282	I	884	“ That ’s more complicated . ”
426325	426345	426346	426346	She	9246	“ I have a fondness for them . I feel an affinity toward them . But that ’s all . ”
426363	426370	426371	426371	I	884	“ Do n’t get me wrong , ”
426374	426399	426371	426371	I	884	“ they do mean something to me . But it hardly measures the depths that I believe others feel for people they care for . ”
426400	426406	426346	426346	She	9246	“ Does that bother you ? ”
426407	426418	426419	426419	I	884	“ It intrigues me . Bother me ? Not really . ”
426437	426456	426419	426419	I	884	“ It actually makes me strong , I think . No one has the power to hurt me . ”
426611	426614	426615	426615	Celia	9246	“ Hudson . ”
426625	426631	426615	426615	Celia	9246	“ Teach me , Hudson . ”
426638	426643	426615	426615	Celia	9246	“ Experiment with me . ”
426644	426655	426656	426656	I	884	“ What ? Why would you want me to … ? ”
426668	426679	426656	426656	I	884	“ I ’m not experimenting on people I know anymore . ”
426680	426688	426689	426689	She	9246	“ Not on me . With me . ”
426694	426707	426689	426689	She	9246	“ I want to learn how you do it . Teach me . ”
426721	426728	426709	426709	her	9246	“ No . That ’s absurd . ”
426729	426732	426656	426656	I	884	“ Please . ”
426733	426736	426739	426739	she	9246	“ No . ”
426754	426757	426746	426746	I	884	“ Why ? ”
426758	426767	426656	426656	I	884	“ Because I want to be like that . ”
426768	426772	426746	426746	I	884	“ Like what ? ”
426773	426781	426782	426782	She	9246	“ Like someone who does n’t feel . ”
426789	426972	426782	426782	She	9246	“ I do n’t want to feel anymore . I said I felt numb , but there ’s worse hiding underneath that . Jagged spikes of pain . I wanted that baby , Hudson . And before that , I wanted you . Not anymore , but I did . All that ’s left from all that want is hurt . I tried to hate you , and I do a little . But mostly I ca n’t help but admire you . Your methods are impressive . Maybe you ’re an example of evolution . Maybe a lack of emotion is what it takes to move the human race to the next level . Because I think you ’re right — it is your strength . And I do n’t know if you were born that way or if you turned into this over time because of your fucked - up family — sorry , but it ’s true — but I think I could learn that . Or at least try . What ’s the harm in letting me try ? ”
427007	427010	426973	426973	Her	5667	“ Okay . ”
427017	427022	427011	427011	She	5667	“ Okay ? Really ? ”
427118	427129	427112	427112	Celia	9246	“ After Christmas . If you ’re up to it . ”
427130	427138	427139	427139	She	5667	“ I ’ll be up to it . ”
427173	427198	427164	427164	I	884	“ There will be rules . Some we ’ll have to make up as we go since I ’ve never worked with a partner . ”
427199	427213	427139	427139	She	5667	“ Of course . What ’s the fun of a game without rules ? ”
427214	427220	427164	427164	I	884	“ They are n’t games . ”
427242	427251	427237	427237	she	5667	“ They ’re experiments . It ’s science . ”
427252	427284	427306	427306	Jesus	680	“ Whatever you want to call it , Hudson . It ’s semantics . There ’s nothing wrong with having a bit of fun with it . I know you do . ”
427339	427342	427343	427343	I	884	“ Maybe , ”
427346	427359	427343	427343	I	884	“ There is an enjoyment at correctly predicting how people will react . ”
427379	427386	427388	427388	I	884	“ What have I agreed to ? ”
427408	427414	427393	427393	She	5667	“ Thank you , Hudson . ”
427415	427420	427393	427393	She	5667	“ You ’re welcome . ”
427494	427532	427491	427491	she	5667	“ You ’re so ridiculous , you know . You ’re like the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz . All the time he does n’t think he has a heart and yet he really does . ”
427533	427538	427491	427491	she	5667	“ An interesting comparison . ”
427594	427604	427585	427585	him	5677	“ Except I do n’t really have a heart . ”
427660	427684	427649	427649	she	5667	“ You realize , Celia , anything that appears like an act of compassion on my part is simply that — an act . ”
427685	427721	427722	427722	She	5667	“ Why act at all ? I mean , with me , for example . Why claim to be my baby ’s father ? Why let me bully my way into your ‘ experiments ? ’ ”
427856	427887	427888	427888	She	9246	“ I see you formulating a response over there , Hudson . Do n’t bother . If you are n’t going to answer honestly , do n’t answer at all . ”
427895	427908	427888	427888	She	9246	“ I ’d prefer if you just said you did n’t know . ”
427923	427929	427913	427913	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
428159	428164	428156	428156	he	5690	“ Was it mine ? ”
428229	428237	428238	428238	I	884	“ I did n’t sleep with her , ”
428245	428265	428238	428238	I	884	“ But that child was never yours . Do n’t ever speak like it was anything but mine again . ”
429225	429232	429233	429233	she	1120	“ Because when you love someone , ”
429247	429257	429233	429233	she	1120	“ their world interests you more than your own . ”
429319	429330	429331	429331	I	884	“ Jesus , Alayna . You ’re so goddamn beautiful , ”
429352	429366	429339	429339	I	884	“ I might have to let you wear that while I fuck you . ”
429385	429389	429390	429390	I	884	“ Come here , ”
429401	429411	429393	429393	She	1120	“ Wait , I ’m in control , remember ? ”
429475	429480	429461	429461	I	884	“ Then take charge . ”
429499	429506	429488	429488	She	1120	“ Sit back against the headboard . ”
429601	429606	429585	429585	she	1120	“ Do it again . ”
429625	429630	429631	429631	she	1120	“ Maybe I will , ”
429665	429675	429676	429676	She	1120	“ Oh precious , you suck me so good . ”
429752	429757	429758	429758	she	1120	“ You want more ? ”
429761	429768	429758	429758	she	1120	“ You ’ll have to wait . ”
429897	429903	429904	429904	I	884	“ What do you want ? ”
429917	429922	429904	429904	I	884	“ Touch my breasts . ”
429996	430003	429989	429989	I	884	“ Hudson , oh , God . ”
430041	430050	430051	430051	I	884	“ You ’re already so wet , precious . ”
430090	430102	430084	430084	I	884	“ Shall I put my fingers inside you ? Tell me . ”
430103	430111	430112	430112	She	1120	“ I want your cock inside me . ”
430159	430170	430149	430149	I	884	“ But you are n’t ready for me , precious . ”
430171	430177	430178	430178	She	1120	“ I ’m ready enough . ”
430182	430189	430178	430178	She	1120	“ I want to ride you . ”
430237	430247	430248	430248	I	884	“ I ca n’t imagine why I deserve this , ”
430309	430323	430290	430290	I	884	“ I should be rewarding you for your very believable girlfriend act today . ”
430600	430603	430604	430604	I	884	“ Fuck , ”
430607	430618	430619	430619	They	5713	“ You ’re so tight , Alayna . So good . ”
430745	430752	430753	430753	she	1120	“ God , oh , god , ”
430812	430825	430826	430826	She	1120	“ I ’m happy , Hudson . You ’ve made me happy . ”
430879	430888	430874	430874	She	1120	“ And I ’ve made you happy too . ”
430902	430917	430874	430874	She	1120	“ We ’re falling in love . This is us , falling in love . ”
430938	430941	430946	430946	her	1120	“ Enough . ”
432251	432257	432248	432248	I	884	“ It ’s barely eight . ”
432264	432276	432248	432248	I	884	“ To what do we owe the pleasure of your presence ? ”
432283	432298	432277	432277	Her	8844	“ I ’m talking with Sophia about some redesign she wants me to do . ”
432357	432366	432343	432343	I	884	“ Where is she then ? My mother . ”
432370	432389	432390	432390	She	9246	“ She went to go get some magazine with a picture she ’d like to use as inspiration . ”
432406	432424	432390	432390	She	9246	“ What about you ? Why are you up and dressed for business during your Hampton vacation ? ”
432425	432436	432482	432482	I	884	“ An emergency at work . My vacation is over . ”
432437	432449	432450	432451	My mother	9246	“ Oh , Hudson , I ’m sorry to hear that . ”
432473	432481	432450	432451	My mother	9246	“ Are you and Alayna both leaving ? ”
432499	432510	432496	432496	OJ	487	“ No . I did n’t want to wake her . ”
432549	432568	432569	432569	I	884	“ I ’ll leave my car for her to take back to the city if she ’d like , ”
432585	432601	432577	432577	I	884	“ If she ’d prefer a cab , you can give her this for fare . ”
432645	432648	432649	432649	She	9246	“ Okay . ”
432670	432679	432664	432664	she	9246	“ How are you getting to the city ? ”
432689	432725	432680	432680	I	884	“ I need to get to the East Hampton airport actually . My plane is already set to meet me there . I just need Martin to take me , if you do n’t mind . ”
432726	432740	432741	432741	She	9246	“ He ’s not here until later , I ’m sorry to say . ”
432831	432837	432838	432838	Celia	9246	“ I ’ll take you , ”
432858	432864	432865	432865	I	884	“ That ’s not necessary , ”
432874	432892	432865	432865	I	884	“ You have a meeting with my mother . I ’ll take one of the other cars . ”
432913	432944	432902	432903	My mother	442	“ Do n’t be silly , Hudson . Let her take you . Our business is n’t a rush . We can meet later . Ca n’t we , Celia ? ”
432945	432949	432950	432950	Celia	9246	“ Of course . ”
433001	433004	432992	432992	I	884	“ Fine . ”
433088	433094	433079	433079	Mirabelle	1120	“ Where are you going ? ”
433139	433152	433133	433133	she	442	“ But you are n’t even going to say goodbye to Laynie ? ”
433158	433165	433153	433153	I	884	“ I ’m in a rush . ”
433175	433196	433166	433166	She	442	“ It will take you two minutes . Get the eff upstairs and tell your girlfriend what ’s going on . ”
433197	433208	433209	433209	I	884	“ Mirabelle , I do n’t have time for this . ”
433244	433250	433251	433251	She	10263	“ Hudson , this is … ”
433260	433293	433251	433251	She	10263	“ It ’s terrible , is what it is . I ’m usually on your side , and you know that , but I ’m rather ashamed of you at the moment . ”
433332	433337	433338	433338	I	884	“ Make sure Alayna … ”
433351	433359	433341	433341	I	884	“ Make sure she gets home okay . ”
433539	433550	433530	433530	Celia	9246	“ How long are you going to keep me waiting ? ”
433559	433569	433551	433551	I	884	“ What do you want to know , Celia ? ”
433570	433580	433581	433581	Her	9246	“ Do n’t be a fucking dick , Hudson . ”
433591	433598	433581	433581	Her	9246	“ You know what I want . ”
433711	433718	433719	433719	I	884	“ It ’s over , Celia , ”
433722	433728	433719	433719	I	884	“ The game is over . ”
433732	433738	433729	433729	She	9246	“ Not this bullshit again . ”
433739	433754	433755	433755	I	884	“ No , not this bullshit . That ’s not what I ’m saying . ”
433773	433809	433755	433755	I	884	“ I ’m telling you that I ’ve put my time in . Like you wanted . And now it ’s over . There is n’t anything else that you need to complete your experiment . ”
433820	433826	433810	433810	Her	9246	“ What do you mean ? ”
433827	433831	433832	433832	I	884	“ I mean … ”
433869	433918	433864	433864	I	884	“ I mean that she ’s already emotionally invested in me . I do n’t need to spend any more time with her . I can end the business arrangement I have with Alayna , and you ’ll be able to study her reaction like you wanted to . ”
433924	433940	433919	433919	Celia	9246	“ Game over means all of it , Hudson . That means the personal too . ”
433941	433945	433919	433919	Celia	9246	“ I know . ”
434346	434351	434343	434343	she	9246	“ Are you su — ”
434357	434367	434352	434352	I	884	“ Do you doubt my experience in these matters ? ”
434398	434422	434394	434394	she	9246	“ No . I do n’t doubt you . It ’s just so soon . I had expected we ’d need more time . ”
434443	434457	434440	434440	I	884	“ It is soon . Alayna gives her heart easily , it seems . ”
434540	434544	434545	434545	Celia	9246	“ And you ? ”
434705	434775	434701	434701	I	884	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re implying . But it does n’t matter . I do n’t have time for this charade anymore . I have a business I ’m trying to run and a subsidiary company that I ’m on the verge of losing . If you do n’t mind , I need to focus my attention on that right now and not this silly game . ”
434849	434857	434837	434837	We	5757	“ Maybe I was wrong about you . ”
434889	434895	434858	434858	Her	8844	“ What does that mean ? ”
434899	434912	434896	434896	She	8844	“ You ’re too grown - up to play , I guess . ”
434943	434978	434930	434930	I	884	“ Too grown - up because I have a life and responsibilities ? Yes , I am too grown - up . These experiments do n’t have a place in my life any longer . ”
434979	434987	434988	434988	she	8844	“ I do n’t know about that , ”
434997	435002	434988	434988	she	8844	“ We ’ll see . ”
435597	435602	435589	435589	he	180	“ Hey , Pierce . ”
435846	435849	435850	435850	She	5774	“ Hudson . ”
435878	435889	435873	435873	She	5774	“ I read about Plexis . I ’m so sor — ”
435906	435916	435901	435901	I	884	“ What ’s going on with you and him ? ”
435983	435986	435987	435987	She	5774	“ Nothing . ”
435990	436006	435987	435987	She	5774	“ David was , um … it was a friendly hug , that ’s all . ”
436015	436027	436007	436007	Her	5774	“ The expression on his face was much more than friendly . ”
436052	436058	436044	436044	I	884	“ Have you fucked him ? ”
436059	436062	436073	436073	she	5774	“ No ! ”
436094	436098	436099	436099	I	884	“ But almost , ”
436102	436105	436106	436106	Her	5774	“ No . ”
436128	436136	436118	436118	her	5774	“ Why do n’t I believe you ? ”
436137	436154	436118	436118	her	5774	“ Because you have some serious trust issues . What is your fucking deal , anyway ? ”
436243	436254	436226	436226	I	884	“ I told you before . I do n’t share . ”
436324	436334	436306	436306	I	884	“ But I have to share you with Celia ? ”
436335	436360	436361	436361	I	884	“ Goddammit , Alayna . How many times do I have to say it ? There is nothing going on with me and Celia . ”
436433	436445	436425	436425	she	5774	“ And there ’s nothing going on with me and David . ”
436446	436461	436425	436425	she	5774	“ Really ? That ’s not how it looked when I walked in here . ”
436462	436485	436425	436425	she	5774	“ Just like that ’s not how it looked when you left with Celia while I was still naked in your bed ? ”
436512	436536	436499	436499	I	884	“ Leaving you that morning was the hardest fucking thing I ’ve done in a long time . Do n’t treat it lightly . ”
436602	436607	436598	436598	She	5774	“ Hudson , stop . ”
436650	436653	436654	436654	She	5774	“ Stop . ”
436660	436671	436654	436654	She	5774	“ No . I have to fuck you . Now . ”
436672	436681	436654	436654	She	5774	“ Why ? Are you marking your territory ? ”
436725	436753	436714	436714	My	884	“ You do n’t own me , Hudson ! Stop messing with me like I ’m one of your other women . Not with me , remember ? ”
436776	436822	436770	436770	I	884	“ Do n’t you think I know that ? Every minute of every day , I remind myself that I ca n’t conquer you . That I ca n’t do that to you . But it does n’t mean that I do n’t want to . ”
436935	436944	436932	436932	her	9246	“ So I am just like the others . ”
436945	436952	436953	436953	I	884	“ No . You ’re not . ”
436989	436995	436996	436996	I	884	“ I told you before , ”
437000	437016	436996	436996	I	884	“ I do n’t want to hurt you more than I need to win you . ”
437024	437031	437017	437017	She	9246	“ You ’ve already done both . ”
437041	437044	437032	437032	Horror	488	“ Fuck ! ”
437226	437229	437230	437230	I	884	“ Alayna . ”
437622	437638	437639	437639	I	884	“ I wanted to win you . But I did n’t want to hurt you . ”
437646	437655	437639	437639	I	884	“ That ’s the last thing I wanted . ”
437717	437729	437730	437730	She	8844	“ That ’s part of relationships , H. People get hurt . ”
437735	437745	437730	437730	She	8844	“ But you can make it better , too . ”
437801	437806	437790	437790	I	884	“ Tell me how . ”
437822	437827	437807	437807	She	9246	“ Let me in . ”
437828	437837	437838	437838	I	884	“ Do n’t you see I already have ? ”
438076	438086	438063	438063	She	9246	“ Why do you act like I ’m running ? ”
438087	438102	438063	438063	She	9246	“ Because you shut me out . Is n’t that the same as running ? ”
438146	438169	438141	438141	she	9246	“ What about you ? What about how you showed up in our bedroom crying and could n’t even tell me why ? ”
438176	438181	438170	438170	She	9246	“ That was different . ”
438220	438230	438214	438214	I	884	“ What did she say to you , Alayna ? ”
438242	438254	438231	438231	She	442	“ That I was insignificant . She called me a whore . ”
438292	438300	438282	438282	I	884	“ My mother ’s heartless and cruel . ”
438337	438366	438326	438326	I	884	“ You ’re not a whore , Alayna . Not even close . And the magnitude of your importance in my life ca n’t be put into words . ”
438391	438403	438388	438388	she	442	“ She also said that you ca n’t ever love me . ”
438491	438499	438483	438483	I	884	“ I ’ve told you that before . ”
438507	438515	438516	438516	She	442	“ Well , she told me again . ”
438522	438534	438516	438516	She	442	“ So there , I opened up . Are you happy ? ”
438559	438562	438555	438555	I	884	“ Alayna … ”
438630	438671	438627	438627	she	442	“ How could you not think I ’d fall in love with you , Hudson ? Even if you did n’t mean for it to happen , how could I not ? Does that mean anything to you at all ? ”
438680	438687	438672	438672	I	884	“ How can you ask that ? ”
438739	438750	438732	438732	I	884	“ Of course , it does . But , Alayna , ”
438755	438771	438732	438732	I	884	“ you do n’t know that you ’d still say that if you knew me . ”
438772	438778	438732	438732	I	884	“ I do know you . ”
438779	438783	438732	438732	I	884	“ Not everything . ”
438795	438805	438732	438732	I	884	“ Only because you have n’t let me in ! ”
438814	438872	438806	438806	I	884	“ What is it you want to know ? About what I did to other women ? About Celia ? I ’m the reason she got pregnant , Alayna . Because I spent an entire summer making her fall in love with me when I felt nothing for her . For fun . For something to do . ”
438942	438982	438936	438936	I	884	“ And then , when I ’d completely broken her , she became destructive — sleeping around , partying , drugs . You name it , she did it . She did n’t even know who the father was . ”
439113	439121	439102	439102	She	8844	“ So you claimed it was yours . ”
439122	439125	439126	439126	I	884	“ Yes . ”
439139	439145	439146	439146	Her	8844	“ Because you felt responsible . ”
439156	439183	439185	439185	I	884	“ Yes . She lost the baby at three months . Likely from the drinking and drugs she ’d consumed early on . She was devastated . ”
439253	439258	439259	439259	Alayna	8844	“ That ’s awful , ”
439298	439303	439304	439304	she	8844	“ It ’s awful , ”
439314	439333	439304	439304	she	8844	“ but I do n’t understand . You thought this would make me not love you … why ? ”
439350	439377	439334	439334	I	884	“ Because it changes everything . I did that . That ’s who I am . It ’s my past , and it ’s very ugly . ”
439412	439424	439400	439400	She	8844	“ Do you think your ugly is any different than mine ? ”
439455	439471	439445	439445	They	5792	“ This is n’t like following someone around or calling too many times , Alayna . ”
439472	439554	439555	439555	Her	8844	“ It was an unforeseen tragedy , Hudson . A game that got out of hand . You did n’t set out for Celia to get pregnant and have a miscarriage . And you ca n’t diminish the things I ’ve done to a simple statement like that either . I hurt people . Deeply . But that was before . Less than ideal pasts , remember ? It does n’t mean it defines our future . Or even our now . ”
439629	439641	439617	439617	I	884	“ When I ’m with you , I almost believe that . ”
439642	439655	439612	439612	I	884	“ That just means you need to spend more time with me . ”
439662	439669	439659	439659	me	884	“ Is that what that means ? ”
439728	439774	439718	439718	I	884	“ Yesterday morning , when I got the phone call that required me to be in Cincinnati — I could n’t even let myself look at you , sleeping in that bed . If I did , I would n’t have been able to leave . ”
439780	439797	439775	439775	Her	8844	“ I thought you left because you were freaking out . Because of the love stuff . ”
439798	439805	439775	439775	Her	8844	“ I was n’t freaking out . ”
439817	439826	439813	439813	I	884	“ I was surprised , that ’s all . ”
439827	439830	439775	439775	Her	8844	“ Surprised ? ”
439831	439840	439841	439841	I	884	“ That that ’s what we were feeling . ”
439848	439854	439841	439841	I	884	“ That it was love . ”
439855	439859	439860	439860	she	8844	“ It was , ”
439865	439869	439860	439860	she	8844	“ It is . ”
439870	439873	439874	439874	I	884	“ Hmm . ”
439950	439962	439938	439938	she	8844	“ I never felt this before . I did n’t know . ”
439976	439997	439963	439963	I	884	“ But , Alayna , I ’ve never had a healthy romantic relationship . Every woman who ’s loved me … ”
440019	440029	439963	439963	I	884	“ I do n’t want to break you too . ”
440030	440041	440042	440042	She	8844	“ You ’re not going to break me , Hudson . ”
440047	440073	440042	440042	She	8844	“ I thought you might , at first . Turns out you make me better . And I think I do the same for you . ”
440074	440078	440079	440079	She	8844	“ You do . ”
440088	440117	440042	440042	She	8844	“ If you decide to not … follow through … with whatever this is that we have , it will hurt . But I wo n’t be broken . ”
440118	440124	440125	440125	I	884	“ But it would hurt ? ”
440144	440149	440042	440042	She	8844	“ Like a motherfucker . ”
440215	440222	440203	440203	I	884	“ Then we better follow through . ”
440264	440280	440245	440245	her	8844	“ Alayna , you ’re fired . You ca n’t be my pretend girlfriend anymore . ”
440297	440304	440245	440245	her	8844	“ Be my real girlfriend instead . ”
440311	440320	440308	440308	her	8844	“ I kind of think I already am . ”
440321	440325	440308	440308	her	8844	“ You are . ”
440326	440334	440308	440308	her	8844	“ Can I still call you H ? ”
440335	440339	440308	440308	her	8844	“ Absolutely not . ”
440490	440494	440475	440475	She	8844	“ What now ? ”
440560	440570	440556	440556	I	884	“ Come to my place after you finish here . ”
440571	440579	440548	440548	I	884	“ I ’m not off until three . ”
440580	440593	440594	440594	I	884	“ I do n’t care . I want you in my bed . ”
440624	440629	440611	440611	she	8844	“ Then , yes . ”
440727	440731	440732	440732	I	884	“ Nice couch , ”
440742	440745	440739	440739	She	8844	“ Thanks . ”
440861	440877	440906	440906	She	8844	“ Tell Jordan to take you to The Bowery . He knows where it is . ”
440878	440884	440906	440906	She	8844	“ Not the fuck pad ? ”
440890	440905	440906	440906	She	8844	“ No . My home . I ’ll leave a key with the doorman . ”
440927	440941	440915	440915	I	884	“ We ’re really doing this , are n’t we ? Moving forward . ”
440942	440946	440947	440947	I	884	“ We are . ”
440982	440991	440979	440979	she	8844	“ I ’m going to rock your world . ”
441017	441023	440993	440993	she	8844	“ I ca n’t wait . ”
441024	441028	441002	441002	her	8844	“ Neither can I. ”
441441	441475	441430	441430	I	884	“ Monica , I ’d like to be a gentleman about this , but there ’s just no polite way to tell you how much I ’m going to make you come tonight . ”
441537	441544	441521	441521	She	9246	“ Who the fuck is she ? ”
441574	441587	441559	441559	I	884	“ Celia . I did n’t realize you ’d be over tonight . ”
441608	441611	441612	441612	Celia	9246	“ Yeah , ”
441618	441627	441612	441612	Celia	9246	“ I guess I should have called first . ”
441685	441688	441689	441689	Monica	202	“ Hudson , ”
441712	441719	441689	441689	Monica	202	“ Who the fuck is she ? ”
441720	441724	441725	441725	I	884	“ She ’s … ”
441748	441756	441757	441757	She	9935	“ I ’m Celia . A friend . ”
441767	441787	441788	441788	She	9935	“ I ’m really sorry to interrupt your date . I ’ll just go get dressed . Excuse me . ”
441798	441801	441788	441788	She	9935	“ Hudson ? ”
441822	441843	441802	441802	I	884	“ She ’s no one , Monica . An old friend . I did n’t know she ’d be here . ”
441861	441874	441854	441854	she	9935	“ Why is she here then ? Does she have a key ? ”
441893	441895	441887	441887	Celia	9246	“ girlfriend ”
442032	442041	442042	442042	I	884	“ Yes , she does have a key . ”
442056	442084	442042	442042	I	884	“ But only because she stays here now and then . When she ’s fighting with her boyfriend . I did n’t know she ’d be here . ”
442112	442119	442107	442107	Monica	202	“ She ’s naked , Hudson ! ”
442120	442132	442133	442133	I	884	“ Obviously she did n’t know I ’d be here either . ”
442147	442168	442133	442133	I	884	“ Come on . I ’ll make her sleep on the sofa . Or we can get a hotel room . ”
442182	442193	442169	442169	She	5815	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m even considering this . ”
442194	442208	442169	442169	She	5815	“ Monica , come on . Stay . I want you to stay . ”
442255	442264	442246	442246	I	884	“ You know you want to stay too . ”
442265	442277	442280	442280	she	5815	“ I do want to , but I do n’t know . ”
442321	442349	442317	442317	she	5815	“ No . I ca n’t . Maybe this is innocent like you say , but I think it ’s a cue to take a step back . ”
442361	442367	442350	442350	I	884	“ Okay . I understand . ”
442376	442398	442368	442368	I	884	“ I ’m crazy hard for you right now though . I ’m going to be thinking about you all night . ”
442399	442410	442350	442350	I	884	“ Good . I ’ll be thinking about you too . ”
442482	442486	442474	442474	she	5815	“ Call me ? ”
442487	442490	442495	442495	her	5815	“ Tomorrow . ”
442524	442527	442528	442528	I	884	“ Goodnight . ”
442642	442648	442649	442649	she	5815	“ How did it go ? ”
442652	442668	442669	442669	I	884	“ Considering that I ’m hard as stone , I ’d say not very well . ”
442684	442694	442669	442669	I	884	“ But she still wants to see you again ? ”
442753	442767	442768	442768	I	884	“ You do n’t seem to care that you cock - blocked me , ”
442786	442801	442768	442768	I	884	“ I do n’t . I care about whether she ’ll see you again . ”
442814	442821	442802	442802	I	884	“ She ’ll see me again . ”
442853	442874	442840	442840	I	884	“ But what the fuck , Celia ? It was n’t in the plan for you to be here tonight . ”
443014	443025	443026	443026	She	9246	“ It was awesome improv though , was n’t it ? ”
443054	443062	443063	443063	I	884	“ I ’ll admit no such thing . ”
443086	443123	443074	443074	She	9246	“ Come on , it was perfect . I ’m supposed to make her jealous and suspicious , and trust me , old friend naked in boyfriend ’s apartment is the perfect way to do that . ”
443138	443146	443124	443124	I	884	“ You ’re extremely happy about this . ”
443147	443153	443168	443168	She	9246	“ And you ’re not ? ”
443154	443167	443124	443124	I	884	“ Do I need to remind you of the cock - block ? ”
443176	443199	443168	443168	She	9246	“ Oh , my God . You and your dick . Go whack off in the shower . You ’ll be fine . ”
443219	443227	443201	443201	she	9246	“ Now admit that I did good . ”
443238	443243	443235	443235	I	884	“ You did good . ”
443270	443283	443235	443235	I	884	“ Actually , you did really good , Celia . Nice job . ”
443310	443326	443327	443327	I	884	“ You ’re a lot more flexible with the experiments than you used to be , ”
443330	443338	443327	443327	I	884	“ You ’ve come a long way . ”
443390	443411	443412	443412	She	9246	“ I ’d hope I ’m better . We ’ve been doing this now for … what ? Three years ? ”
443436	443448	443422	443422	she	9246	“ It ’s about time I finally got a Hudson compliment . ”
443497	443508	443509	443509	She	9246	“ I ’ve complimented you before . Have n’t I ? ”
443514	443526	443509	443509	She	9246	“ I ’m not complaining . I have n’t deserved it . ”
443573	443584	443563	443563	She	9246	“ Remember that couple in your building ? The newlyweds ? ”
443626	443731	443620	443620	her	9246	“ I ’d been so nervous when I first approached him . Tim was his name . I was supposed to drop that bag of groceries , remember ? And see if he ’d help me with it . That was all there was to the first contact . You ’d coached me and coached me . I swear I stood in that alcove of the lobby watching him flick through his mail for , I do n’t know , an eternity before I had the guts to go out there . Then dropping my bag was easy because I was shaking so hard . ”
443732	443745	443832	443832	I	884	“ But he noticed you . He helped you with the groceries . ”
443746	443767	443768	443768	Her	5830	“ He brushed my hand even . On purpose , I think . And it was only our first meeting . ”
443779	443816	443817	443817	She	5830	“ He kept staring at my cleavage , and I remember how amazing it felt to have his attention , but at the same time , I thought he was a bit of a smarmy asshole . ”
443820	443831	443817	443817	She	5830	“ Obviously , I got over the smarmy asshole part . ”
443835	443838	443832	443832	I	884	“ Obviously . ”
443995	444009	444010	444010	She	9246	“ I still get nervous the first time we start any new game . ”
444040	444060	444010	444010	She	9246	“ And this is the first time I ’ve felt comfortable changing things up without talking to you first . ”
444061	444075	444076	444076	I	884	“ Well , we do n’t need to make that a habit now . ”
444090	444101	444076	444076	I	884	“ We ’ll see how it goes , I guess . ”
444264	444270	444259	444259	Celia	9246	“ Is that your dick ? ”
444271	444279	444259	444259	Celia	9246	“ I told you I was hard . ”
444308	444311	444312	444312	She	9246	“ Still ? ”
444325	444336	444312	444312	She	9246	“ I can do something about that if you want . ”
444337	444342	444312	444312	She	9246	“ Are you serious ? ”
444370	444374	444375	444375	She	9246	“ Why not ? ”
444412	444421	444406	444406	I	884	“ Uh , thank you , but no . ”
444442	444449	444450	444450	Her	9246	“ You ’re such an asshole . ”
444458	444477	444450	444450	Her	9246	“ You ’re a total man - whore , but you wo n’t let me suck you off ? ”
444478	444485	444455	444455	her	9246	“ It would ruin our relationship . ”
444486	444489	444450	444450	Her	9246	“ Whatever . ”
444527	444535	444517	444517	you	5842	“ Are you really serious about this ? ”
444539	444553	444536	444536	She	9246	“ I ’m excited about how tonight went . It made me horny . ”
444554	444560	444562	444562	I	884	“ I get the excitement . ”
444570	444578	444562	444562	I	884	“ I ’ll buy you a vibrator . ”
444579	444582	444583	444583	She	9246	“ Fine . ”
444591	444605	444583	444583	She	9246	“ I ’m not really interested in sucking your hairy little prick anyway . ”
444646	444668	444639	444639	I	884	“ Little ? Did you just call my dick little ? Maybe you need to put your foot back here again . ”
444669	444676	444677	444677	She	9246	“ No , no , no ! ”
444710	444738	444696	444696	I	884	“ Just a minute ago , you were willing to put your mouth on me , and now you ca n’t even touch me with your foot ? ”
444747	444772	444739	444739	She	9246	“ I was joking . I would n’t suck you , Hudson . Or fuck you . Ever . It would be … weird . ”
444773	444777	444778	444778	I	884	“ Very weird . ”
444796	444804	444805	444805	I	884	“ And it would mess up this . ”
444818	444826	444815	444815	She	9246	“ Agreed . And this is nice . ”
444827	444833	444834	444834	We	5843	“ I do like this . ”
444984	444989	444975	444975	I	884	“ Are you staying ? ”
445047	445052	445053	445053	she	9246	“ I ’m staying , ”
445056	445081	445053	445053	she	9246	“ Do I have any clothes still here ? I could n’t find any in the closet , and I usually have some items . ”
445082	445121	445040	445040	she	9246	“ I hid all your things in case Monica stayed over . They ’re not that hard to find . Back of the armoire , in the closet . If she snooped , she would have found them . ”
445122	445125	445053	445053	she	9246	“ Smart . ”
445281	445291	445292	445292	Her	9246	“ Do you think you ’ll ever stop playing ? ”
445326	445330	445314	445314	I	884	“ The game ? ”
445341	445349	445335	445335	she	9246	“ No . I ’ll always play . ”
445391	445399	445376	445376	I	884	“ I do n’t have a choice . ”
445400	445408	445450	445450	She	9246	“ Of course you have a choice . ”
445436	445441	445423	445423	I	884	“ What about you ? ”
445442	445449	445450	445450	She	9246	“ It ’s good for now . ”
445455	445465	445450	445450	She	9246	“ But I could see myself quitting one day . ”
445516	445533	445509	445509	her	9246	“ You ’re fooling yourself . You could never quit . You love it too much . ”
445568	445580	445560	445560	She	9246	“ I do love it . Parts of it , anyway . ”
445756	445760	445751	445751	I	884	“ Which parts ? ”
445761	445764	445765	445765	she	9246	“ Hmm , ”
445782	445786	445787	445787	she	9246	“ The pain , ”
445791	445799	445787	445787	she	9246	“ I like seeing people in pain . ”
445861	445864	445848	445848	I	884	“ Why ? ”
445865	445879	445884	445884	She	9246	“ I do n’t know , really . I ca n’t explain it . ”
445880	445883	445848	445848	I	884	“ Try . ”
445896	445906	445884	445884	She	9246	“ It makes my own pain feel diminished somehow . ”
445910	445918	445907	445907	I	884	“ What pain can you possibly have ? ”
445919	445934	445935	445935	She	9246	“ Hey , even spoiled little rich girls can have things that hurt them . ”
445989	446082	445984	445984	she	9246	“ Do n’t ask me what my pain is specifically , though . I have n’t felt anything in so long that I do n’t remember . But it ’s there somewhere — I know it . Waiting for me . And every time someone else cries and falls apart , it gets smaller . I keep thinking if I just hurt enough people , break enough hearts , then eventually it will all go away . And I wo n’t have to play anymore . I can go back to feeling . ”
446133	446142	446126	446126	her	9246	“ Why would you want to do that ? ”
446143	446156	446157	446157	She	9246	“ Because I remember what it ’s like to be in love . ”
446179	446193	446173	446173	she	9246	“ I ’d like to feel that again , I think . Someday . ”
446194	446210	446173	446173	she	9246	“ Again , I ask , why the fuck would you want to do that ? ”
446211	446226	446227	446227	She	9246	“ You ’ve never been in love , Hudson . You could n’t understand . ”
446238	446241	446227	446227	She	9246	“ Goodnight . ”
447711	447721	447722	447722	she	9246	“ I thought you said this was family only , ”
447757	447770	447752	447752	I	884	“ She left something in the car . Excuse us a moment . ”
448046	448053	448035	448035	I	884	“ The Werners are practically family . ”
448061	448068	448054	448054	She	8844	“ Right . Uh - huh . ”
448069	448083	448054	448054	She	8844	“ What , do you think I did n’t tell you on purpose ? ”
448122	448134	448119	448119	She	8844	“ You do n’t want to know what I ’m thinking . ”
448135	448141	448142	448142	She	8844	“ Actually , I do . ”
448147	448154	448142	448142	She	8844	“ No , you do n’t . ”
448206	448216	448201	448201	I	884	“ Trust me when I tell you I do . ”
448217	448236	448237	448237	Her	8844	“ Hudson , you ca n’t say that when you do n’t know what I want to say . ”
448249	448298	448237	448237	Her	8844	“ It ’s not good . In fact , you need to leave me alone . Or I ’m going to blame you for things . Things I ’m probably overreacting about , and you ’re going to be offended . And I ’m going to lose you . ”
448420	448429	448430	448430	I	884	“ You are n’t going to lose me . ”
448447	448464	448440	448440	Her	8844	“ You have n’t seen this side of me , Hudson . You do n’t know . ”
448527	448543	448521	448521	I	884	“ Then I need to stay . I need to see every side of you . ”
448593	448600	448589	448589	I	884	“ Go ahead . Ask me . ”
448601	448613	448614	448614	Her	8844	“ It wo n’t be asking ; it will be accusing . ”
448723	448727	448728	448728	I	884	“ Do it , ”
448731	448750	448728	448728	I	884	“ I want to hear it . I need to know what you ’re thinking . Trust me . ”
448755	448770	448751	448751	She	8844	“ You did n’t invite me tonight because you knew she ’d be here . ”
448858	448887	448855	448855	I	884	“ That ’s not true . I told you why I did n’t invite you . And I did invite you in the end . You ’re here . ”
448888	448898	448900	448900	she	8844	“ But you did n’t want to at first . ”
448912	448945	448900	448900	she	8844	“ That ’s probably why you had to doll me up . To show up Celia , whatever your game with her is . It was n’t about your mother at all . ”
448953	448958	448948	448948	me	884	“ You ’re right . ”
448964	449000	448959	448959	Her	8844	“ You ’re right that it was n’t about my mother . It was about you . I wanted everyone to see how beautiful you are . How beautiful the woman who loves me is . ”
449041	449053	449029	449029	she	8844	“ Celia . You wanted to show Celia , you mean . ”
449068	449075	449076	449076	she	8844	“ She ’s here , Hudson ! ”
449079	449114	449076	449076	she	8844	“ She ’s here with free rein , and I had to beg to be here . And you told me you would n’t see her without me . What is she to you ? ”
449115	449122	449123	449124	An enemy	2331	“ Nothing . An old friend . ”
449135	449138	449139	449139	Her	8844	“ Bullshit . ”
449143	449164	449165	449165	She	8844	“ Otherwise you would have told me about this dinner from the beginning . You were hiding it from me . ”
449173	449183	449165	449165	She	8844	“ Because you knew she would be here too . ”
449184	449190	449191	449191	I	884	“ I did n’t know . ”
449230	449234	449235	449235	I	884	“ I suspected , ”
449238	449261	449235	449235	I	884	“ But she ’s not here because of me . Her mother is my mother ’s best friend . You know that . ”
449262	449295	449337	449338	her mother	1858	“ Fuck that . She ’s twenty - eight years old . She ’s old enough to not go to every goddamn function with her mother . She ’s here for you . ”
449395	449403	449404	449404	I	884	“ And I ’m here with you , ”
449432	449441	449442	449442	Her	1858	“ She ’s still in love with you . ”
449459	449466	449467	449467	I	884	“ And I ’m with you . ”
449525	449531	449511	449511	I	884	“ I ’m with you . ”
449569	449586	449587	449587	I	884	“ I ’m hard for you and only you . It ’s you that I adore . ”
449669	449675	449676	449676	I	884	“ I ’m with you , ”
449817	449822	449823	449823	I	884	“ That ’s it , ”
449834	449843	449823	449823	I	884	“ Relax . Let me be with you . ”
449938	449951	449952	449952	I	884	“ It ’s you that I ’m about to go down on , ”
449956	450004	449952	449952	I	884	“ It ’s you I ’m going to make come with my mouth , so that when we go back down there and you start to feel insecure , you will still be wet and you ’ll remember my lips were on you and no one else . ”
450119	450124	450125	450125	I	884	“ Take it out , ”
450204	450210	450211	450211	She	1858	“ We ’re not alone . ”
450248	450275	450242	450242	I	884	“ Take it out . I do n’t care about anyone or anything but being inside you right now . I have to be inside you . ”
450313	450322	450323	450323	I	884	“ Goddamn , your pussy is so good . ”
450334	450352	450323	450323	I	884	“ Do you hear me ? Your pussy makes me this hard . No one else ’s . ”
450392	450427	450381	450381	I	884	“ When we go back down to dinner , I will smell like you and you will smell like me . And you ’ll remember that we are together . I am with you . ”
450473	450479	450458	450458	She	1858	“ No one but you . ”
450705	450717	450718	450718	he	245	“ I ’m very sorry to hear about your Plexis deal , ”
450740	450749	450751	450751	I	884	“ You win some , you lose some . ”
450844	450855	450837	450837	I	884	“ Is GlamPlay still looking to buy into Werner Media ? ”
450859	450873	450874	450874	He	245	“ They ’re toying with me . Have n’t made up their mind . ”
450882	450903	450874	450874	He	245	“ It would be a great advantage for both corporations , but I ca n’t quite convince them of that . ”
450977	450986	450964	450964	I	884	“ How much is GlamPlay looking to buy ? ”
450987	451006	451025	451025	GlamPlay	490	“ Thirty percent is on the table . Any more than that would put me at a liability . ”
451007	451011	450964	450964	I	884	“ Of course . ”
451046	451062	451038	451038	I	884	“ Is the portion on the table from your shares or from the other investors ? ”
451069	451074	451063	451063	He	1556	“ All from me . ”
451179	451211	451176	451176	he	245	“ Are you interested in further investing ? Bishop is looking to sell his two percent . Great time to buy . Prices are going to go up if GlamPlay invests . ”
451214	451224	451212	451212	Bingo	492	“ I ’ll have my people contact Bishop tomorrow . ”
451369	451372	451373	451373	she	8844	“ Divine , ”
451376	451384	451385	451385	I	884	“ I could say the same thing . ”
451536	451543	451546	451546	Sophia	1858	“ It ’s not the same . ”
451553	451571	451546	451546	Sophia	1858	“ Sitkin - Pierce is not Pierce . So the bloodline continues , but not the name . ”
451656	451667	451645	451645	Sophia	1858	“ Hudson and Celia ’s baby could have been both . ”
451856	451874	451875	451875	He	8755	“ Not this again , Sophia . Really ? Goddammit , I wo n’t listen to this . ”
451883	451982	451875	451875	He	8755	“ Thank you everyone , I wish I could say it has been a lovely evening , but , well , I ’ll leave it at that . I ’ll take care of the bill on my way out . The rest of you stay and enjoy . Order dessert . As for my wife , I ’m not going to invite her to rot in hell , as I probably should , because I think she already lives there . At least hell is where anyone who spends time with her feels like they ’ve been sent . ”
452093	452099	452100	452100	She	1858	“ What a drama queen . ”
452108	452129	452100	452100	She	1858	“ I was merely pointing out that we had a chance at a Pierce grandchild and now it ’s gone . ”
452157	452166	452149	452149	I	884	“ I could have a child with Alayna . ”
452367	452387	452359	452359	my	884	“ Are you talking marriage and children already ? It ’s early for that , Hudson . Incredibly early . ”
452388	452411	452412	452412	I	884	“ Oh Mother , do n’t be so old - fashioned . You do n’t need to be married to have children . ”
452420	452435	452412	452412	I	884	“ And what Alayna and I are discussing is frankly none of your business . ”
452441	452447	452436	452436	Sophia	1858	“ You brought it up . ”
452448	452472	452473	452473	I	884	“ I was stating that I could father a child , and that would continue both your precious bloodline and your precious name . ”
452486	452504	452473	452473	I	884	“ And the only person I could ever imagine wanting to have a child with is Alayna . ”
452582	452587	452588	452588	Alayna	8844	“ Hudson , I … ”
452680	452710	452714	452714	Alayna	8844	“ The point is that you need to let the past go , Mother . There is still a future to look forward to . For all of us . ”
452823	452858	452813	452813	Alayna	8844	“ Well , look , Hudson . You scared her off with your talk of a future . She ’s smart enough to know there ’s no such thing with a man like you . ”
452859	452865	452866	452866	Mirabelle	1120	“ Oh , stop it , ”
452869	452880	452866	452866	Mirabelle	1120	“ If anyone scared her off , it was you . ”
452941	452954	452931	452931	I	884	“ Actually , Mother , powder room is our code for DTF . ”
453001	453010	452998	452998	I	884	“ Google it . You ’ll learn something . ”
453018	453041	453011	453011	I	884	“ Happy birthday , Mother . Perhaps next year you can manage to make it through the meal without running anyone off . ”
453042	453051	453052	453052	she	442	“ You ’re charming as always , Hudson , ”
453061	453066	453011	453011	I	884	“ Are n’t I ? ”
453085	453105	453079	453079	he	676	“ It means down to fuck , Mom . He means he ’s meeting Alayna for a booty call . ”
453220	453224	453225	453225	she	1120	“ So … ? ”
453254	453261	453262	453262	Celia	9246	“ She ’s still in there , ”
453270	453278	453262	453262	Celia	9246	“ She ’s fine . Now spill . ”
453295	453306	453279	453279	I	884	“ I ’m sorry . I should have called you . ”
453307	453310	453311	453311	She	1120	“ Probably . ”
453319	453333	453311	453311	She	1120	“ Did you decide you needed more time with the game , then ? ”
453401	453416	453396	453396	my	884	“ No , the game is over . This is … this is real . ”
453421	453440	453417	453417	Her	1120	“ Are you … ? I ca n’t tell if you ’re kidding or not . Did you … ”she
453455	453463	453450	453450	she	1120	“ … fall in love with her ? ”
453484	453496	453477	453477	Alayna	8844	“ I did . I am . In love with her . ”
453522	453528	453512	453512	She	1120	“ But you ’ve never — ”
453534	453552	453529	453529	I	884	“ No , I have n’t ever . It ’s the first time . I’m … I’m … ”
453580	453585	453586	453586	Her	1120	“ You ’re speechless . ”
453600	453611	453594	453594	She	1120	“ God , I ’ve never seen you like this . ”
453612	453616	453586	453586	Her	1120	“ Neither have I. ”
453617	453620	453621	453621	She	1120	“ Wow . ”
453635	453656	453621	453621	She	1120	“ I ’m so surprised . Forgive me if I seem flustered . I ’m just really , really surprised . ”
453657	453665	453666	453666	My	884	“ You ’re not the only one . ”
453685	453695	453696	453696	Celia	9246	“ And she ’s in love with you too ? ”
453713	453720	453723	453723	she	1120	“ I really think she is . ”
453745	453759	453760	453760	Celia	9246	“ I think you ’re right . The way she looks at you … ”
453770	453791	453764	453764	her	9246	“ You promise you are n’t trying to pull one over on me ? You really feel something for her ? ”
453808	453818	453796	453796	she	1120	“ I promise . This is the real thing . ”
453826	453838	453796	453796	she	1120	“ Which is why I ca n’t play this game anymore . ”
453853	453858	453859	453859	Her	1120	“ Of course not . ”
453872	453910	453862	453862	she	1120	“ I mean , I knew you were into her , but I thought it was just sex and that ’s why I was pushing you to keep playing . I had no idea it was serious . ”
453920	453930	453911	453911	I	884	“ Are you … okay … with this then ? ”
453931	453965	454026	454026	I	884	“ Why would n’t I be ? You mean because of the scheme ? Is that why you were so distant during dinner ? Did you think I ’d be upset about this ? ”
453974	453985	453968	453968	my	884	“ You ’ve never been one to drop an experiment . ”
453986	454001	454002	454002	She	1120	“ No , I have n’t . But this is a totally different situation . ”
454007	454025	454002	454002	She	1120	“ I ’m worried it ’s too late though . We ’ve already pushed her too far . ”
454029	454035	454026	454026	I	884	“ What do you mean ? ”
454036	454045	454046	454046	She	1120	“ In the bathroom just now . She … ”
454056	454071	454046	454046	She	1120	“ It ’s probably nothing , but she cornered me . Verbally attacked me . ”
454095	454101	454091	454091	I	884	“ What did she say ? ”
454108	454145	454102	454102	She	1120	“ It does n’t matter what she said exactly . But she was possessive . It seemed to be a repeat of behavior straight out of her file . I think she may already be relapsing . ”
454178	454186	454102	454102	She	1120	“ I ’m not concerned about it . ”
454187	454199	454155	454155	Alayna	8844	“ You ’re not concerned ? But if she needs therapy — ”
454200	454220	454221	454221	I	884	“ If she needs therapy , I ’ll get it for her . What she really needs is reassurance . ”
454229	454253	454221	454221	I	884	“ Look — you’re the ex - girlfriend in her eyes . Is n’t it common to have some jealousy in that arena ? ”
454254	454280	454281	454281	She	9246	“ Yes . I suppose you ’re right . Forget I said anything . She loves you , and she ’s protecting what ’s hers . ”
454300	454319	454296	454296	she	9246	“ I ’m sorry ; I was n’t prepared for all this . I ’m a little flustered . ”
454345	454352	454336	454336	I	884	“ Celia … are you okay ? ”
454361	454398	454353	454353	She	9246	“ I ’m fine . I ’m touched . Jesus , what ’s going on with this world ? Hudson Pierce falling in love , and me getting touched by it . Who would have thought ? ”
454406	454420	454399	454399	She	9246	“ This is a good thing , though . Surprising , but good . ”
454620	454634	454607	454607	I	884	“ Maybe it ’s time for you to let love in as well . ”
454640	454643	454635	454635	She	9246	“ Pssh . ”
454655	454658	454659	454659	she	9246	“ Maybe , ”
454675	454692	454693	454693	She	9246	“ But let ’s not talk about me right now . Does Alayna know about … ? ”
454709	454719	454693	454693	She	9246	“ You have n’t told her , have you ? ”
454758	454768	454755	454755	my	884	“ No . I do n’t think I can . ”
454769	454774	454775	454775	She	9246	“ You ca n’t . ”
454786	454819	454775	454775	She	9246	“ Not if you want to keep her . Trust me on this . I ’ve been scammed by you before . There ’s no way she ’ll love you after that . ”
454879	454892	454870	454870	Celia	9246	“ I ’m not saying that to upset you . I just — ”
454893	454897	454898	454898	I	884	“ I know . ”
454909	454932	454898	454898	I	884	“ It ’s the truth . I have to keep it from her . It ’s only you and me that know — ”
454933	454941	454870	454870	Celia	9246	“ And I wo n’t tell her . ”
454963	454976	454949	454949	she	9246	“ I hate to ask this , but do you swear that ? ”
454977	455021	454959	454959	she	9246	“ I swear , Hudson . Not only because you asked me not to , but because it ’s the code . We do n’t speak about the game to anyone . Even if we ’re not playing anymore , old rules apply . ”
455022	455026	455027	455027	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
455172	455187	455148	455148	she	9246	“ You ’ve been a better friend than I ’ve given you credit for . ”
455188	455193	455194	455194	She	9246	“ Back at you . ”
455199	455214	455194	455194	She	9246	“ A really good friend , Hudson . You saved me , you know . ”
455291	455297	455287	455287	I	884	“ You saved me too . ”
455309	455325	455298	455298	She	9246	“ I have to go back . Good luck , Hudson . I mean that . ”
455923	455931	455920	455920	she	8844	“ Where did you go ? Earlier . ”
455937	455947	455932	455932	I	884	“ Does it matter ? I ’m here now . ”
456052	456059	456039	456039	I	884	“ Mon amour . Mon précieux , ”
456066	456075	456039	456039	I	884	“ Mon chéri . Mon bien - aimé . ”
456178	456181	456182	456182	Celia	9246	“ Hudson . ”
456256	456261	456251	456251	My	884	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
456262	456271	456232	456232	her	8844	“ I need to see you . Now . ”
456309	456323	456345	456345	She	8844	“ Now ’s not good , Celia . Can I call you tonight ? ”
456324	456331	456332	456332	Her	8844	“ No . It ’s urgent . ”
456339	456344	456332	456332	Her	8844	“ It ’s Alayna . ”
456644	456648	456635	456635	I	884	“ Hudson Pierce . ”
456649	456653	456654	456654	His	710	“ Brian Withers . ”
456675	456682	456661	456661	I	884	“ Good to finally meet you . ”
456683	456706	456707	456707	I	884	“ You as well . Though you ’ll pardon me for not being privy to the circumstances in which we ’re gathered . ”
456724	456741	456742	456742	Her	9246	“ I was just getting to that , Hudson . Why do n’t you sit down ? ”
456814	456819	456810	456810	I	884	“ I ’ll stand . ”
456820	456825	456791	456791	she	9246	“ Whichever you prefer . ”
456826	456836	456810	456810	I	884	“ I prefer you explain what ’s going on . ”
456916	456922	456923	456924	My mother	442	“ Calm down , Hudson . ”
456941	456947	456934	456934	Her	442	“ Pour yourself a drink . ”
456948	456957	456958	456959	my father	8755	“ Of course that would be your solution , ”
457018	457048	457008	457008	I	884	“ There ’s no other way to say this except to just come out and say it . Alayna has been … well , she ’s been harassing me . ”
457090	457095	457096	457096	Celia	9246	“ Not just harassment , ”
457099	457128	457096	457096	Celia	9246	“ She ’s been — I hate to use the word , but it ’s the one that fits — stalking me . Calling me . Following me . ”
457129	457135	457136	457136	I	884	“ Stalking you , Celia ? ”
457159	457164	457165	457165	she	9246	“ Stalking , Hudson , ”
457176	457181	457168	457168	Brian	495	“ Not this again . ”
457254	457264	457241	457241	she	9246	“ This is bullshit . Get the fuck out . ”
457265	457271	457272	457272	Celia	9246	“ Hold on , Hudson . ”
457277	457298	457272	457272	Celia	9246	“ Before you decide not to believe me , listen to what I have to say . I have proof . ”
457378	457383	457384	457384	Celia	9246	“ This proves nothing . ”
457445	457451	457452	457452	Celia	9246	“ And look at this , ”
457494	457551	457462	457462	her	442	“ This is at the job site where I ’ve been working this week . Fit Nation . She ’s shown up there so many times to bother me that I asked the front desk guy to document it the next time she came in . This is from today , Hudson . Twenty minutes ago . ”
457557	457562	457552	457552	I	884	“ This is ridiculous . ”
457563	457573	457574	457574	She	442	“ You just do n’t want to hear it . ”
457722	457732	457712	457712	she	442	“ Drop it , Celia . Let this go . ”
457770	457802	457764	457764	She	442	“ There ’s more . Besides the calls , Alayna ’s shown up at restaurants while I was dining , left messages with my office , followed me on the street . ”
457803	457812	457813	457813	I	884	“ It ’s a bunch of goddamned lies . ”
457820	457840	457813	457813	I	884	“ This is what you wanted to happen , and when it did n’t , you made it up . ”
457841	457852	457853	457853	Celia	9246	“ I did n’t want it to happen , Hudson . ”
457868	457872	457853	457853	Celia	9246	“ Not anymore . ”
457962	457964	457950	457950	she	9246	“ proof ”
458016	458024	458025	458026	My mother	442	“ Why would Celia make it up ? ”
458079	458087	458088	458088	Jack	10551	“ Because that ’s what she does . ”
458135	458155	458125	458125	she	9246	“ Ah , and many of these questions can now be settled because the subject at hand has arrived . ”
458170	458176	458177	458177	she	442	“ What ’s going on ? ”
458186	458189	458190	458190	God	8844	“ Alayna — ”
458711	458720	458695	458695	Celia	9246	“ I told you that night , remember ? ”
458789	458797	458781	458781	I	884	“ I do n’t need a reminder . ”
458798	458807	458808	458808	Celia	9246	“ He refused to believe me then too , ”
458846	458859	458860	458861	My mother	442	“ He ’s blinded by the sex . It ’s not real . ”
458879	458887	458876	458876	Alayna	8844	“ She told you I harassed her ? ”
458974	458986	458987	458987	Her	442	“ Why did n’t you say anything to me , Hudson ? ”
459194	459202	459203	459204	my mother	442	“ Do you hear her , Hudson ? ”
459209	459219	459220	459220	She	442	“ She threatened Celia . In front of everyone . ”
459225	459233	459220	459220	She	442	“ Mother , stay out of this . ”
459234	459275	459203	459204	my mother	442	“ Hudson , you have to get rid of her . She ’s dangerous . Celia tells me she has a record . Why on earth would you let her into your life when you knew these things about her ? ”
459282	459288	459276	459276	I	884	“ Shut up , Mother . ”
459411	459453	459399	459399	I	884	“ It makes sense why she ’d be obsessed with Celia . She knows you belong together , Hudson , and she ’s jealous . Celia was pregnant with your baby . She ca n’t compete with that , no matter — ”
459454	459464	459468	459468	her	8844	“ Aw , shut the fuck up , Sophia , ”
459471	459488	459468	459468	her	8844	“ It was n’t even Hudson ’s baby . It was mine , you ignorant bitch . ”
459511	459516	459496	459496	My	884	“ Goddammit , Jack . ”
459517	459525	459526	459526	he	8755	“ It ’s my business to tell , ”
459529	459539	459526	459526	he	8755	“ and I ’m tired of this lingering lie . ”
459540	459551	459556	459556	I	884	“ It was n’t a lie we told for you . ”
459703	459706	459707	459707	I	884	“ Alayna , ”
459738	459744	459734	459734	I	884	“ Why did you leave ? ”
459745	459766	459734	459734	I	884	“ Is n’t it obvious ? That was a madhouse , and I did n’t want to be there anymore . ”
459767	459774	459734	459734	I	884	“ Yes , that it was . ”
459796	459810	459811	459811	she	442	“ I , um … why did n’t you defend me up there ? ”
459821	459845	459811	459811	she	442	“ Are you that mad about the David situation ? It ’s me that ’s supposed to be mad at you , remember ? ”
459956	459959	459960	459960	She	442	“ Wait — ”
459970	459975	459960	459960	She	442	“ You believe her . ”
459985	459988	459960	459960	She	442	“ Hudson ? ”
459998	460004	459989	459989	I	884	“ I believe in you . ”
460015	460034	460005	460005	They	6053	“ And whatever you need , I want to give it to you . If you need help — ”
460035	460046	460047	460047	She	442	“ Oh my god , I ca n’t believe this . ”
460053	460061	460047	460047	She	442	“ I ca n’t fucking believe this . ”
460079	460105	460062	460062	I	884	“ Tell me that you did n’t do it . Tell me you did n’t call her . Tell me you did n’t see her . ”
460168	460200	460163	460163	She	442	“ It ’s not how it looks , Hudson . I did n’t stalk her or harass her or whatever she ’s claiming . Are you on her side or mine ? ”
460201	460213	460163	460163	She	442	“ I ’m on your side . Always , your side . ”
460237	460243	460244	460244	Her	442	“ Then you believe me ? ”
460294	460300	460282	460282	I	884	“ Did you call her ? ”
460301	460310	460311	460311	She	442	“ Yes ! I said I did upstairs ! ”
460324	460355	460311	460311	She	442	“ Here , you want to see ? Take it ! You ’ll see all the times I called her since that ’s what you seem to be concerned with . ”
460362	460375	460356	460356	I	884	“ I do n’t want proof . I want to help you . ”
460376	460385	460386	460386	She	442	“ I do n’t fucking need any help ! ”
460495	460502	460492	460492	I	884	“ Alayna , come back here . ”
460510	460524	460492	460492	I	884	“ I ’ll cancel my trip . We ’ll find the best treatment — ”
460525	460531	460532	460532	She	442	“ I ’m not sick . ”
460540	460555	460532	460532	She	442	“ Go to Japan , Hudson . I do n’t want to see you . ”
460572	460581	460560	460560	I	884	“ I ’m not going to Japan now . ”
460601	460606	460607	460607	she	442	“ Go to Japan , ”
460613	460661	460607	460607	she	442	“ I do n’t want to see you for a while , if not ever . Got it ? If you ’re at the penthouse when I get home , I ’ll find somewhere else to sleep , and I do n’t mean for just one night . ”
460876	460899	460871	460871	they	664	“ Thank you everyone for the chaos in my living room . It ’s time for all of you to go now . ”
460924	460962	460920	460920	I	884	“ Not you . I ’d like you to stay , if you do n’t mind . Alayna has asked me not to be here when she returns , but I ’d rather she is n’t alone . ”
460972	460980	460963	460963	Brian	495	“ I suppose that would be fine . ”
460981	460990	460991	460991	I	884	“ Where are you staying ? The Waldorf ? ”
461004	461029	460991	460991	I	884	“ I ’ll arrange to have your things moved over here . The guest room is down the hall . Make yourself at home . ”
461069	461084	461061	461061	I	884	“ And I did n’t mean you should leave . We have to talk . ”
461092	461102	461085	461085	Her	9246	“ Hudson , I ’m not in the mood . ”
461103	461113	461114	461114	My	884	“ Oh , let ’s not talk about mood . ”
461142	461152	461153	461153	Her	9246	“ Do you not realize what just happened here ? ”
461163	461185	461153	461153	Her	9246	“ My parents are going to fucking kill me . They were never supposed to find out about me and Jack . ”
461186	461216	461246	461246	She	9246	“ It ’s called karma , Celia . You reap what you sow . And today you sowed a lot of bad karma . Would you care to explain ? ”
461217	461236	461237	461237	She	9246	“ I ’ve done all my talking . I have to be somewhere now , so pardon me . ”
461260	461267	461254	461254	I	884	“ I ’ll see you down . ”
461287	461293	461294	461295	My mother	442	“ I ’m coming too . ”
461316	461322	461308	461308	I	884	“ Take the next elevator . ”
461337	461349	461330	461330	She	442	“ I ’m not staying another minute here with that man . ”
461364	461372	461350	461351	That man	2042	“ I ’ll take the next elevator . ”
461394	461397	461398	461398	I	884	“ Fine , ”
461411	461425	461401	461401	I	884	“ Though I ’m surprised you do n’t mind being with this woman . ”
461441	461460	461461	461461	She	442	“ I know Jack . He ’s the one who ’s responsible . It was n’t her fault . ”
461468	461492	461461	461461	She	442	“ He took advantage of you , honey . I understand . He was the grown - up . You were the child . ”
461510	461524	461495	461495	Celia	9246	“ Thank you , Sophia . That means more than you could know . ”
461544	461548	461549	461549	I	884	“ Jesus Christ , ”
461574	461591	461567	461567	she	442	“ I ’m not happy with you either , Hudson . Covering for that cheating bastard — ”
461592	461597	461598	461598	I	884	“ I was n’t — ”
461616	461640	461611	461611	She	442	“ Whatever . I ’m not going through this with you , Mother . Work out your feelings about this on your own . ”
461641	461651	461652	461652	Her	442	“ I do n’t know why I expected sympathy . ”
461660	461669	461652	461652	Her	442	“ I forgot who I was dealing with . ”
461675	461682	461670	461670	I	884	“ Like mother , like son . ”
461683	461692	461720	461720	she	1858	“ That ’s not how the saying goes . ”
461706	461717	461693	461693	Celia	9246	“ This must be so hard for you , Sophia . ”
461742	461750	461751	461751	She	0	“ It is . It ’s devastating . ”
461766	461796	461751	461751	She	0	“ God , it feels like so much of the last ten years have been a lie . The baby . The baby was n’t even mine at all . ”
461889	461906	461882	461882	I	884	“ Save it for your shrink . I said I did n’t want to hear it . ”
461926	461933	461917	461917	I	884	“ Hey , hey , hey . ”
461952	461966	461917	461917	I	884	“ We are n’t done . I ’ll see you to your car . ”
461967	461973	461936	461936	her	9246	“ I did n’t drive . ”
461974	461986	461917	461917	I	884	“ I ’ll wait with you until your driver shows up . ”
461987	461996	461936	461936	her	9246	“ I was planning on taking a cab . ”
461997	462003	462004	462004	I	884	“ We ’ll cab together . ”
462013	462044	462004	462004	I	884	“ Celia , we ’re having a conversation whether you want to or not . And we ’re having it now , though you are welcome to choose our location . ”
462054	462059	462049	462049	she	9246	“ Cab , then . ”
462085	462108	462070	462070	I	884	“ This scam of yours , Celia — it ’s not cute . It ’s not even clever . It ends now . ”
462109	462136	462182	462182	She	9246	“ I love how you immediately assume that anything I say is a scam . You ca n’t ever give me the benefit of the doubt ? ”
462137	462181	462070	462070	I	884	“ I did give you the benefit of the doubt . I believed you when you stood there and told me you were happy for me . That you would give up this experiment with Alayna . Blatant lies is your trick now ? ”
462193	462199	462182	462182	She	9246	“ I changed my mind . ”
462200	462221	462070	462070	I	884	“ And now you ’re changing your mind again . Alayna is not your subject . Your experiment is over . ”
462229	462252	462222	462222	Her	9246	“ Is there a threat buried in there ? Let ’s not forget that I know things you do n’t want shared . ”
462333	462356	462381	462381	Her	9246	“ You wo n’t tell Alayna that I played her . You wo n’t tell anyone . It ’s against the rules . ”
462357	462380	462381	462381	Her	9246	“ You ’re concerned with the rules ? The game is over for you . What do you care about the rules ? ”
462387	462392	462381	462381	Her	9246	“ How dare you ? ”
462393	462399	462381	462381	Her	9246	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
462400	462411	462381	462381	Her	9246	“ You heard me . How the fuck dare you ? ”
462474	462513	462463	462463	she	9246	“ I always adhered to our law . I did everything exactly as I said I would , even with Alayna . My only sin was to fall in love . And that was never against the rules . ”
462514	462520	462463	462463	she	9246	“ It was certainly implied . ”
462532	462550	462521	462521	I	884	“ You ’re the one who ’s gone off plan . You ’ve even changed the goal . ”
462551	462564	462463	462463	she	9246	“ I changed nothing . The goal was to make her break . ”
462574	462595	462565	462565	I	884	“ You mean the test was to see if she would break . There was no goal to make her . ”
462630	462661	462623	462623	I	884	“ When did our aim become to hurt people ? We were scientists , not executioners . We were n’t malicious . We did n’t set out to hurt people . ”
462668	462747	462662	462662	She	9246	“ You ’re so fucking clueless , Hudson . We ’ve been hurting and destroying people since the game began . You always pretended like that was just an unfortunate side effect , but even pursuing an experiment that might hurt someone is malicious . It ’s like performing harmful research on humans . Scientists do n’t do that as a rule . You know why ? It ’s not just unethical ; it ’s against the law . ”
462756	462794	462752	462752	she	9246	“ I get it , Hudson , I do . You did n’t want to face how fucking cruel you really are , so you told yourself what you had to in order to live with yourself . ”
462891	462900	462901	462901	We	6083	“ It ’s not the same at all . ”
462917	462934	462911	462911	I	884	“ And the fact that you think so shows what a cruel bitch you really are . ”
462944	462960	462935	462935	She	6084	“ We ’ve resorted to name - calling now , have we ? How fun ! ”
462966	462974	462935	462935	She	6084	“ You ca n’t fucking be serious . ”
462975	462991	462992	462992	I	884	“ I ’m dead serious , Celia . You will end this . And us … ”
463016	463044	463006	463006	I	884	“ We ’re over too . I want you out of my life . Do n’t call me . Do n’t stop by . Do you understand ? ”
463066	463086	463057	463057	she	6084	“ It ’s not that easy to just cut me out of your life , Hudson . Our families — ”
463101	463135	463045	463045	She	6084	“ I ’m not so sure our families will be a problem after today . I ’d bet our parents are not going to want to spend much time together from now on . ”
463155	463166	463151	463151	She	6084	“ Well , we run in the same social circles . ”
463167	463190	463200	463200	she	6084	“ And you will steer away from me when we show up at the same event . Do I make myself clear ? ”
463206	463209	463200	463200	she	6084	“ Perfectly . ”
463216	463227	463213	463213	I	884	“ You do not want to make me your enemy . ”
463228	463240	463252	463252	She	6084	“ Funny , I thought you ’d already made me yours . ”
463341	463360	463325	463325	We	6089	“ Farewell , Hudson . This is for good , I suppose . The taxi ’s on you . ”
463609	463630	463631	463631	Chandler	676	“ Why ca n’t I just ditch tonight after the actual rehearsal ? That ’s the important part , right ? ”
463673	463687	463659	463659	her	442	“ I do n’t understand why you ’re so eager to abandon us . ”
463703	463709	463710	463710	He	0	“ Because it ’s boring ! ”
463718	463721	463722	463723	my mother	442	“ Chandler ! ”
464043	464050	464051	464051	he	442	“ No one will miss me , ”
464055	464061	464062	464063	My mother	3088	“ I ’ll miss you . ”
464180	464205	464173	464173	she	1120	“ I ’ll miss you ! So for one night , Chandler , can you forget about your friends and stay ? For me ? ”
464522	464541	464543	464544	my mother	1120	“ Good thing your hair only hits your shoulders . We ’d never get ready in time otherwise . ”
464551	464588	464543	464544	my mother	1120	“ I should have cut it . Then we would n’t have to worry about this at all . I ’m thinking I ’ll get a pixie as soon as the honeymoon ’s over . Thoughts ? ”
464603	464611	464613	464613	I	884	“ Are you trying to kill me ? ”
464627	464647	464621	464621	Sophia	1858	“ I still do n’t know why you did n’t hire someone to do your hair and makeup tonight . ”
464651	464673	464648	464648	Mirabelle	1120	“ I did n’t think I ’d need to get made up tonight . I ’ll have enough of that tomorrow . ”
464738	464747	464748	464748	Mirabelle	1120	“ Thank you for being here , Hudson , ”
464759	464773	464748	464748	Mirabelle	1120	“ It means a lot that you can share this time with me . ”
464792	464814	464815	464815	I	884	“ I have to admit , this is n’t my thing . Yet , I ’m glad I ’m here too . ”
464862	464880	464881	464881	Mirabelle	1120	“ I ’m sure you have a spiel waiting on the tip of your tongue , though , ”
464889	464903	464881	464881	Mirabelle	1120	“ How love is a myth and marriage the bane of all evil . ”
464913	464936	464904	464904	I	884	“ Not to mention that you ’re barely old enough to drink . Quite young to be signing off your entire life . ”
465027	465044	465011	465011	She	1120	“ I trust you know what you ’re doing , Mirabelle . Do n’t mind me . ”
465045	465051	465052	465052	Her	1120	“ I usually do n’t . ”
465074	465113	465064	465064	I	884	“ And I do know what I ’m doing . Adam is the best thing for me . He makes me happy . I make him happy . You know . It ’s all a bunch of happy . ”
465189	465224	465176	465176	She	1120	“ I mean , I know it wo n’t always be top of the world . There will be hard times . But none of that matters as long as we have each other . ”
465225	465234	465186	465186	she	1120	“ Excuse me while I roll my eyes . ”
465235	465248	465249	465249	She	1120	“ You wo n’t know until you find it yourself , Hudson . ”
465275	465295	465304	465304	she	1120	“ But did you have to get married ? Could n’t you shack up together for a while first ? ”
465316	465325	465326	465326	She	1120	“ Nope . I have to get married . ”
465338	465341	465343	465344	my mother	442	“ Mirabelle ! ”
465348	465361	465326	465326	She	1120	“ Is there something you are n’t telling me , little sister ? ”
465370	465400	465401	465401	she	442	“ I ’m not pregnant , you ass . I ’m in love . And yes , I still have to get married . Because when you love someone , ”
465417	465460	465401	465401	she	442	“ their world interests you more than your own . So much so that you disappear into them , and the only choice you have is to merge your life with theirs . Because otherwise , you cease to exist at all . ”
465521	465538	465516	465517	my mother	442	“ I could n’t wait to marry your father . Did I ever tell you that ? ”
465651	465662	465663	465663	Mirabelle	1120	“ No , Mom , you have n’t told us , ”
465679	465741	465663	465663	Mirabelle	1120	“ We were more in love than anyone should have the right to be . It scared my father , I think . When we announced our engagement , he nearly had a heart attack . ‘ How will he ever provide for you ? ’ As if my trust fund did n’t give me enough money to provide for myself . ”
465770	465831	465742	465742	Sophia	1858	“ But Daddy took Jack out for ‘ a talking to . ’ And when they came back , it was decided that we could get married as long as your father took over the Walden companies . It was a win - win as far as I was concerned . Our worlds were becoming entwined in every way possible . ”
465906	465961	465962	465962	She	1858	“ My father wanted Jack to take over as soon as we were married . Since I wanted a short engagement , Jack spent a lot of that time at the office with Dad . I did n’t see him nearly as much as I would ’ve liked . Our wedding day , though . ”
465966	466003	465962	465962	She	1858	“ It was the happiest day I could imagine . There Jack was , in his tux . So handsome . I kept wishing the ceremony would hurry and get finished so I could jump him . ”
466004	466007	466008	466008	Mirabelle	1120	“ Mother ! ”
466032	466039	466040	466040	Sophia	1858	“ I was young once too . ”
466055	466065	466040	466040	Sophia	1858	“ Then I hope you had a wonderful honeymoon . ”
466077	466140	466073	466073	Mirabelle	1120	“ Well , it started out well . But Jack had to leave the day after we arrived in Bora Bora . Company problems . He was in charge now . You know . If a wife had to be left alone on her honeymoon , then that ’s what had to be done . The story of our lives after that . ”
466282	466296	466297	466297	She	1120	“ But the wedding day was beautiful . And yours will be too . ”
466315	466325	466297	466297	She	1120	“ Look at yourself . You ’re just lovely . ”
466364	466373	466353	466353	She	1120	“ Thank you , Mom . For everything . ”
466566	466583	466562	466562	I	884	“ Are n’t you so happy for Mira ? Does n’t she make a lovely bride ? ”
466800	466822	466786	466786	I	884	“ You would n’t have chosen that seat , Melissa , if you did n’t mean to get something from me . ”
466844	466856	466836	466836	I	884	“ And what exactly would I want from you , Hudson ? ”
466857	466884	466889	466889	I	884	“ From the way you ’re shoving your chest at me , I ’d say you want me to fuck your tits in the pool house . ”
466897	466913	466889	466889	I	884	“ But do n’t worry . I ’d give your cunt proper attention as well . ”
466924	466937	466914	466914	Her	1120	“ I ’ll go out first . Wait five minutes to follow . ”
466940	466948	466938	466938	Perfect	501	“ Be naked when I get there . ”
466986	467005	467006	467006	I	884	“ Timothy , I have some off - the - record legal I might want some help with , ”
467010	467024	467006	467006	I	884	“ Would you mind meeting me in the pool house in fifteen minutes ? ”
467052	467058	467047	467047	I	884	“ Make that twenty minutes . ”
467118	467121	467122	467122	I	884	“ Hudson ? ”
467134	467139	467122	467122	I	884	“ Uh , yeah ? ”
467189	467195	467179	467179	She	1120	“ Where are you going ? ”
467196	467207	467179	467179	She	1120	“ Just stepping away for a bit of a breather . ”
467208	467214	467179	467179	She	1120	“ The fuck you are . ”
467253	467264	467221	467221	she	1120	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re talking about . ”
467265	467326	467350	467351	her friend	10374	“ Like hell you do n’t . I ’ve been watching you . I saw you talking to Melissa . And I know you ’ve been with her before . Then she goes off , and you get all whispery with Tim ? This is my wedding weekend , Hudson . I ca n’t even look at you right now . ”
467369	467384	467364	467364	I	884	“ Mirabelle , I really do n’t have any idea what this is about . ”
467385	467393	467394	467394	Her	1120	“ You know what ? Fuck you . ”
467408	467429	467394	467394	Her	1120	“ Fuck you , and I do n’t want you here anymore right now . I want you to leave . ”
467439	467472	467394	467394	Her	1120	“ But so help me God , if you fuck with my friends tonight or tomorrow or during any of my wedding stuff , I will never be able to forgive you . ”
467473	467478	467394	467394	Her	1120	“ Seriously ? I — ”
467479	467484	467485	467485	Her	1120	“ Yes , seriously ! ”
467489	467501	467485	467485	Her	1120	“ I do n’t want you here right now . Go . ”
467533	467540	467525	467525	my	884	“ Fine . I ’ll go . ”
468270	468273	468274	468274	Mirabelle	1120	“ Hudson ? ”
468312	468317	468292	468292	she	1120	“ Here you are . ”
468318	468323	468292	468292	she	1120	“ Here I am . ”
468435	468440	468424	468424	she	1120	“ Mother ’s drunk . ”
468451	468456	468424	468424	she	1120	“ Are you surprised ? ”
468457	468473	468474	468474	Her	1120	“ No . I was hopeful , though . She ’d had a good day . ”
468516	468534	468510	468510	I	884	“ Parties are the easiest time for her to drink without anyone noticing . Everyone ’s drinking . ”
468535	468538	468539	468539	She	1120	“ True . ”
468572	468580	468581	468581	I	884	“ You should be with your guests . ”
468606	468612	468601	468601	She	1120	“ You ’re my guest . ”
468613	468622	468601	468601	She	1120	“ You have more important guests than me . ”
468623	468630	468631	468631	She	1120	“ I do n’t think so . ”
468642	468650	468631	468631	She	1120	“ Besides , we need to talk . ”
468664	468685	468651	468651	I	884	“ If you need last - minute marriage advice , you know what I ’ll say — don’t get married . ”
468686	468719	468720	468720	She	1120	“ You ’re an ass . And no . I ’d never come to you for marriage advice . You ’ll come to me , though . I ’m calling that now . ”
468737	468742	468745	468745	I	884	“ Uh - huh . ”
468801	468821	468790	468790	I	884	“ Look , we do n’t need to talk about earlier . Lapse in judgment . That ’s all . ”
468832	468844	468845	468845	she	1120	“ No . We do n’t need to talk about earlier , ”
468854	468861	468845	468845	she	1120	“ But there ’s something else . ”
468954	468967	468949	468949	she	1120	“ Hudson , I need to talk to you about an intervention . ”
469002	469029	468986	468986	I	884	“ Should n’t Chandler and Dad be here ? They have just as much effect on our mother as I ever would . If not more . ”
469030	469035	469036	469036	She	10263	“ Not for Mother . ”
469044	469048	469036	469036	She	10263	“ For you . ”
469052	469073	469049	469049	I	884	“ This probably seems unconvincing when I ’m drinking straight from the bottle , but I ’m not an alcoholic . ”
469112	469128	469106	469106	I	884	“ Besides , are n’t there supposed to be lots of people at these things ? ”
469129	469189	469190	469190	She	1120	“ Well , they ’re supposed to be formed of a group of people that the addict — that ’s you — loves and will listen to . I happen to think that I ’m the only one who could possibly say anything that matters . At least , I ’m hoping that I can say anything that matters . ”
469209	469220	469198	469198	I	884	“ I do n’t have a drinking problem , Mirabelle . ”
469225	469241	469221	469221	She	1120	“ I do n’t think you have a drinking problem , Hudson . Get real . ”
469246	469263	469221	469221	She	1120	“ But I do think you have a problem . A very different kind of problem . ”
469346	469357	469342	469342	I	884	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ”
469378	469485	469486	469486	They	6184	“ Let ’s not dance around it , Hudson . I do n’t know the word for it anyway . There might not even be one . But I ’m aware . I see it . I see what you do to people . How you … handle them . Like earlier tonight , but this is hardly the first time . Or the fifth . Or even the fiftieth , I ’d bet . It ’s cruel behavior . It ’s destructive . And I do n’t just mean to the people you do it to . But to you . It ’s destroying you . ”
469499	469510	469511	469511	My	884	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ”
469525	469559	469560	469560	She	6185	“ You do know . And you do n’t have to say anything . I do n’t need to hear excuses or details . What I need is for you to hear me . ”
469580	469648	469560	469560	She	6185	“ Hear me , Hudson . You are not who you think you are . There is more in you than you suspect . More to you than the mind games that I think absorb your life . I see it . I feel it . And not because I ’m a hopeless optimist , but because this other part of you is very , very real . ”
469667	469762	469662	469662	she	6185	“ Do n’t . I wo n’t let you break away from me , Hudson . You ca n’t . I ’m invested in you , even if you are n’t invested in yourself . And I ’m about to start a new life . One that might possibly push me further away from you , and here ’s the thing — I ca n’t go if I do n’t know you ’re okay . I ca n’t move my world from yours until I know you are n’t going to destroy your own . ”
469842	469885	469825	469825	Mirabelle	1120	“ So will you do it ? Tell me you ’ll do it . Tell me you ’ll quit . Tell me that you ’re going to try . For me , if for no one else . Please , tell me . ”
470001	470004	469993	469993	I	884	“ Okay . ”
470005	470010	470011	470011	I	884	“ You mean that ? ”
470056	470060	470053	470053	she	1120	“ Thank you . ”
470111	470115	470116	470116	she	1120	“ Thank you , ”
470142	470185	470135	470135	She	1120	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t want to cry . I figured you ’d take me more seriously if I remained together . But , that ’s not me , I guess . Anyway . You have an appointment tomorrow . ”
470186	470194	470135	470135	She	1120	“ An appointment tomorrow ? With who ? ”
470195	470223	470135	470135	She	1120	“ A psychiatrist . Dr. Alberts . He ’s an expert in experiential avoidance and a bunch of other big words that basically mean ‘ aloof . ’ ”
470230	470238	470239	470239	she	1120	“ He ’s situated in the city , ”
470242	470285	470239	470239	she	1120	“ but he makes house calls , and he agreed to come out here to meet you at ten . I arranged it before tonight even happened , Hudson . So do n’t think I ’m just reacting to this one incident . ”
470403	470410	470395	470395	I	884	“ It ’s your wedding day . ”
470411	470422	470423	470423	She	1120	“ And this is my wedding present . From you . ”
470430	470441	470423	470423	She	1120	“ My wedding present was to not work all week . ”
470453	470465	470466	470466	She	1120	“ This is another wedding present . You got me two . ”
470472	470478	470480	470480	I	884	“ Thanks , big bro . ”
470486	470496	470482	470484	the master manipulator	10053	“ What have you done to me , Mirabelle ? ”
470497	470514	470515	470515	She	1120	“ Good things , Hudson . I ’ve done good things . Just wait and see . ”
470550	470592	470547	470547	she	1120	“ But I ’m going to go back to the party now and let you stay here and mope or mull or whatever really boring antisocial thing it is you like to do . Brood . That ’s what you do . ”
470593	470599	470547	470547	she	1120	“ I do n’t brood . ”
470600	470615	470616	470616	She	1120	“ Well , whatever you do , I ’ll leave you to it now . ”
470635	470652	470631	470631	she	1120	“ Ten tomorrow morning . In the study . Dr. Alberts is coming . Be there . ”
470653	470666	470547	470547	she	1120	“ Where else would I be ? Organizing the flowers with Mother ? ”
470667	470671	470672	470672	She	1120	“ Good point . ”
470685	470702	470672	470672	She	1120	“ I love you , brother . Thanks for making my wedding everything I ever dreamed . ”
470920	470925	470903	470903	her	1120	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
470970	470975	470962	470962	I	884	“ Are you okay ? ”
470986	471001	470983	470983	she	1120	“ I just had a bad dream , and now I ca n’t sleep . ”
471063	471070	471058	471058	I	884	“ Want to talk about it ? ”
471078	471084	471071	471071	She	1120	“ Yes . But later . ”
471403	471411	471396	471396	Alayna	8844	“ What happened between you and Stacy ? ”
471412	471415	471396	471396	Alayna	8844	“ Stacy ? ”
471443	471447	471431	471431	she	8674	“ Nothing happened . ”
471460	471499	471431	471431	she	8674	“ What do you mean ? Like did I date her ? I took her to a charity event a year or so ago . But after that , nothing . And I did n’t sleep with her . ”
471508	471527	471500	471500	Alayna	8844	“ Is there a reason she ’d have a vendetta against you ? Or reason to distrust you ? ”
471533	471541	471528	471528	I	884	“ Not that I can think of . ”
471707	471713	471699	471699	I	884	“ Why are you asking ? ”
471720	471775	471714	471714	She	8674	“ The last time we were at Mira ’s , Stacy told me that she had some sort of video . A video that proved something or other about you and Celia . She did n’t have it with her , so I gave her my phone number so she could contact me later . ”
471899	471909	471894	471894	she	8844	“ Do you know what she ’s talking about ? ”
471910	471914	471916	471916	I	884	“ No idea . ”
471923	471935	471916	471916	I	884	“ She did n’t tell you what the video was of ? ”
471936	471988	471894	471894	she	8844	“ No . Just that she had it , and that it would show me why I could n’t trust you . And she texted me again tonight . Or sometime this past week when I did n’t have a phone , and I did n’t get the message until tonight . ”
472041	472048	472073	472073	I	884	“ What did her text say ? ”
472049	472072	472027	472027	Alayna	8844	“ That the video was too big to send over the phone but to contact her if I wanted to see it . ”
472153	472161	472144	472144	I	884	“ Do you want to see it ? ”
472189	472192	472193	472193	She	8844	“ No . ”
472196	472199	472193	472193	She	8844	“ Yes . ”
472202	472211	472193	472193	She	8844	“ I do n’t know . Should I ? ”
472250	472253	472254	472254	I	884	“ Well . ”
472275	472321	472254	472254	I	884	“ You know that Celia ca n’t be trusted already . And there is nothing that Stacy could have on me that you do n’t already know . You know more about my secrets and my past than anyone . You know me , Alayna . ”
472322	472326	472254	472254	I	884	“ I do . ”
472327	472336	472254	472254	I	884	“ Then unless you do n’t trust me … ”
472352	472370	472254	472254	I	884	“ I do trust you . If you say there ’s nothing I should be concerned about … ”
472383	472388	472254	472254	I	884	“ There is n’t . ”
472473	472483	472468	472468	she	442	“ Then I do n’t need to see it . ”
472577	472581	472569	472569	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
472582	472588	472569	472569	I	884	“ For what , exactly ? ”
472604	472626	472599	472599	I	884	“ For being open with me . You did n’t have to tell me about that , and you did anyway . ”
472627	472638	472569	472569	I	884	“ I ’m serious about being more open and honest . ”
472639	472672	472599	472599	I	884	“ I see that . I ’m serious about it too . The only way we can move on is to decide that we ’re committed to each other first and foremost . ”
472731	472735	472748	472748	they	6204	“ Are we ? ”
472736	472740	472748	472748	they	6204	“ I am . ”
472782	472786	472755	472755	her	442	“ So am I. ”
473030	473039	473040	473040	She	442	“ Do you always have to take over ? ”
473049	473061	473045	473045	I	884	“ If you want us both to come , then yes . ”
473085	473100	473062	473062	She	442	“ And who is it that would n’t come if I stayed in control ? ”
473108	473111	473102	473102	she	442	“ You . ”
473228	473237	473220	473220	she	442	“ Alayna . What is it , precious ? ”
473279	473286	473269	473269	I	884	“ Alayna , talk to me . ”
473394	473403	473382	473382	I’ll	451	“ Talk to me . What is it ? ”
473417	473425	473426	473426	Her	442	“ You . Really . Hurt me . ”
473436	473440	473404	473404	Her	442	“ Just now ? ”
473441	473444	473445	473445	She	442	“ No . ”
473454	473472	473445	473445	She	442	“ You really hurt me . With Celia . When you believed her . Instead of me . ”
473492	473497	473498	473498	I	884	“ Oh , Alayna . ”
473529	473545	473518	473518	I	884	“ Tell me . Tell me all of it . I need to hear it . ”
473569	473604	473546	473546	She	442	“ It hurts , Hudson . It hurts so much . Even though you ’re here . Now . And we ’re together . There ’s a hole . A deep , deep hole . ”
473633	473664	473626	473626	I	884	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry . If I could take it back , if I could change how I reacted … I would have chosen differently . ”
473665	473687	473688	473688	She	442	“ I know . I do . But you did n’t choose differently . And you ca n’t take that back . ”
473694	473702	473688	473688	She	442	“ You can never take that back . ”
473703	473710	473722	473722	they	6208	“ No . I ca n’t . ”
473733	473743	473688	473688	She	442	“ And that changes things . It changes me . ”
473754	473757	473744	473744	I	884	“ How ? ”
473758	473784	473744	473744	I	884	“ It makes me vulnerable . Exposed . And you know now . That you can hurt me . You can hurt me real bad . ”
473785	473788	473789	473789	I	884	“ Alayna . ”
473796	473819	473789	473789	I	884	“ My precious girl . I never want to hurt you again . Will you ever be able to … forgive me ? ”
474331	474373	474374	474374	I	884	“ If you purchase GlamPlay under any of your American subsidiaries though , the press is going to get a hold of that information , and it wo n’t be covert like you want . Hudson , are you even listening ? ”
474417	474435	474409	474409	we	6214	“ I heard you . So we need to find a more indirect way to buy GlamPlay . ”
474474	474488	474467	474467	I	884	“ Fuck . I do n’t know . Do you have a suggestion ? ”
474489	474495	474496	474496	She	10443	“ I ’m not sure . ”
474504	474527	474496	474496	She	10443	“ Actually … what if we use Walden Inc. to purchase GlamPlay ? Pierce Industries still holds controlling interest there , right ? ”
474687	474698	474683	474683	I	884	“ It ’s our only shot , is n’t it ? ”
474699	474716	474719	474719	Jack	10551	“ The only one I can think of . Will you have trouble convincing your father ? ”
474734	474742	474743	474743	I	884	“ No . He ’ll do it . ”
474772	474778	474816	474816	Norma	10443	“ Yes , Mr. Pierce ? ”
474779	474794	474816	474816	Norma	10443	“ I need my father on the line in about fifteen minutes , please . ”
474795	474800	474816	474816	Norma	10443	“ Yes , sir . ”
474801	474805	474806	474806	I	884	“ Okay then , ”
474811	474815	474806	474806	I	884	“ Anything else ? ”
474828	474874	474816	474816	Norma	10443	“ Not that I can think of . If all this goes well , we will need to be in L.A. next week for the final signatures . And no , I ca n’t do this for you . You ’ll have to be present . ”
474875	474881	474882	474882	She	10443	“ Great . Thank you . ”
474904	474912	474901	474901	she	10443	“ Hudson , are you all right ? ”
475042	475045	475046	475046	Norma	10443	“ Hudson , ”
475060	475074	475037	475037	she	10443	“ I ’m fine . I just have a lot on my mind . ”
475113	475131	475092	475092	I	884	“ Thank you for meeting with me early . I appreciate all your work on this project . ”
475139	475143	475132	475132	She	10443	“ Of course . ”
475144	475159	475132	475132	She	10443	“ I do n’t need to remind you that this all must remain confidential ? ”
475193	475196	475197	475197	Norma	10443	“ Completely . ”
475200	475216	475197	475197	Norma	10443	“ Oh , by the way , I wanted to thank you for hiring Gwen . ”
475234	475245	475246	475246	I	884	“ I ca n’t take any credit . Thank Alayna . ”
475258	475284	475250	475250	Alayna	8844	“ Norma , may I ask why Gwenyth was so eager to leave the Eighty - Eighth Floor ? I thought she was happy there . ”
475288	475304	475285	475285	Norma	10443	“ She was . Long story . Let ’s just say there was a man . ”
475305	475308	475309	475309	I	884	“ Oh . ”
475323	475350	475285	475285	Norma	10443	“ But on that subject , Gwen would really like to not be found . Do you have any suggestions how we might make that happen ? ”
475366	475384	475385	475385	I	884	“ We ’ll need to pay her under an alternate social security number . That ’s illegal . ”
475395	475402	475385	475385	I	884	“ But I could arrange it . ”
475403	475414	475390	475390	she	8844	“ I ’d very much appreciate whatever you can do . ”
475415	475419	475385	475385	I	884	“ No problem . ”
475497	475509	475510	475510	His	10551	“ Hudson . What a surprise . Is it my birthday ? ”
475540	475555	475536	475536	I	884	“ Your birthday is in December . It ’s July seventh . So no . ”
475562	475577	475556	475556	He	10551	“ Always so serious . How on earth can you possibly be my son ? ”
475578	475608	475609	475609	I	884	“ Come on . We know you ’re my father . The physical resemblance is irrefutable . The real question is : who else on earth is your son ? ”
475634	475655	475631	475631	He	10551	“ So far only three are taking claim . And at least one of them would probably prefer not to . ”
475800	475823	475824	475824	I	884	“ While I ’d love to consider the pros and cons of being a Pierce further , I called for another reason . ”
475852	475858	475848	475848	I	884	“ I need a favor . ”
475859	475866	475878	475878	him	1626	“ Ooh , that ’s intriguing . ”
475900	475906	475878	475878	him	1626	“ Do tell me more . ”
475927	475951	475922	475922	I	884	“ It may not come as any surprise to you , but it has become necessary to remove Celia Werner from my life . ”
475952	475957	475958	475958	he	1626	“ No , really ! ”
475964	475982	475958	475958	he	1626	“ Glad you ’ve finally come around to see the light . That girl is fucked up . ”
476054	476063	476064	476064	he	1626	“ She ’s not like you , Hudson , ”
476067	476094	476064	476064	he	1626	“ I know that you think she is , but she ’s different . She wants to hurt people . You just want to understand them . ”
476113	476124	476103	476103	I	884	“ You ’re right . She ’s not like me . ”
476153	476160	476193	476193	I	884	“ Celia ’s been stalking Alayna . ”
476161	476171	476172	476172	He	1626	“ Fuck . Are you kidding me ? Jesus . ”
476187	476192	476172	476172	He	1626	“ Is Laynie okay ? ”
476198	476218	476193	476193	I	884	“ She is . A bit shaken , but I have a bodyguard on her . She ’s safe . ”
476219	476223	476224	476225	My father	8755	“ Thank God . ”
476295	476324	476288	476288	he	8755	“ Celia has n’t broken the law yet and talking to her has done no good . I need another way to convince her to stop her game . ”
476325	476344	476288	476288	he	8755	“ And I ’m sure you have an idea already in the works . Hit me with it . ”
476391	476397	476387	476389	Warren ’s company	6235	“ If I purchase GlamPlay — ”
476398	476409	476410	476411	my father	8755	“ Then you ’ll be able to boot Warren out , ”
476414	476459	476410	476411	my father	8755	“ Right . I do n’t want to actually take control of Werner Media , I just want to have the power to do so . And since I need it to be covert , I need to buy GlamPlay under a different entity . ”
476460	476467	476468	476469	My father	8755	“ You want to use Walden Inc. ”
476488	476503	476480	476480	He	8755	“ Of course . Tell me what to do , and it ’s done . ”
476559	476567	476551	476551	we	6238	“ Anyone using the cabin this weekend ? ”
476568	476613	476640	476640	her	6239	“ In the Poconos ? Not me . Mira ’s the only one who goes up there really , and she ’s so busy with her opening , she ’s not going to want to leave town . Are you thinking about going up ? ”
476614	476624	476551	476551	we	6238	“ Yeah . I think I ’ll take Alayna . ”
476649	476666	476640	476640	her	6239	“ Good idea . Do you need a key ? I can have mine couriered over . ”
476689	476700	476701	476701	I	884	“ Thanks . I ’d appreciate it . And Dad , ”
476723	476730	476719	476719	I	884	“ Thanks for everything else too . ”
477915	477918	477919	477919	I	884	“ Another , ”
478125	478129	478117	478117	I	884	“ Something funny ? ”
478157	478162	478163	478163	I	884	“ An inside joke , ”
478196	478211	478189	478189	I	884	“ Tell me about it , sugar . Lola ’s got a good ear . ”
478225	478246	478212	478212	She	6262	“ Come on , honey . You would n’t be here if you did n’t want to talk to someone . ”
478257	478268	478247	478247	I	884	“ I ’m here because I want to get loaded . ”
478269	478285	478247	478247	I	884	“ But that ’s not all . Otherwise , you ’d be drinking alone somewhere . ”
478781	478789	478770	478770	She	10443	“ You are n’t in your office . ”
478790	478801	478802	478802	I	884	“ No . I ’m working from my loft today . ”
478815	478821	478809	478809	I	884	“ What do you need ? ”
478822	478829	478770	478770	She	10443	“ Stuart Reed ’s having doubts . ”
478846	478859	478809	478809	I	884	“ Did you explain to him that Walden Inc. is still me ? ”
478860	478906	478809	478809	I	884	“ He ’s not having doubts about that . They ’re ready to sell to you no matter which company you ’re purchasing with . He ’s having doubts about buying into Werner Media . Their latest stock prices were n’t as high as predicted . ”
478907	478926	478927	478927	I	884	“ With the change in the economy , those prices were incredible . What does Reed fucking expect ? ”
478935	478971	478927	478927	I	884	“ You know what ? I do n’t give a fuck about his doubts . We ’ll finish the purchase of GlamPlay first , and then he wo n’t have a choice in the matter . ”
478972	478983	478984	478984	Norma	10443	“ Pissing off Stuart Reed is not a good idea . ”
478990	479023	478984	478984	Norma	10443	“ Of course , you will have full power to do what you want when you own the company , but it will be much easier if Stuart is on your side . ”
479055	479066	479024	479024	I	884	“ What do you suggest I do then , Norma ? ”
479067	479093	479102	479102	Male	507	“ You need to alleviate some of his concerns . I do n’t think it will take much . A friendly conversation off the record . ”
479139	479151	479130	479130	I	884	“ Do you have a plan to arrange this friendly conversation ? ”
479162	479173	479174	479174	Her	10443	“ I would n’t have called if I did n’t . ”
479184	479200	479174	479174	Her	10443	“ Stuart will be at the Breezeway Charity Ball tonight . We ’ll go together . ”
479201	479219	479224	479224	directors	9073	“ To the Breezeway Ball ? Do tell me how you plan to get me in there . ”
479284	479328	479240	479241	his sister	1142	“ Alan will not be there himself . And the name on the guest list is mine . So we ’ll have to go together . We ’ll go late , and we wo n’t stay long . Pick me up at eight . ”
480590	480593	480580	480580	My	884	“ Adam ? ”
480603	480612	480580	480580	My	884	“ What ’s wrong ? Is it Mirabelle ? ”
480613	480619	480620	480620	he	700	“ She ’s having contractions , ”
480623	480630	480620	480620	he	700	“ We ’re at Lennox Hill . ”
480631	480635	480580	480580	My	884	“ The baby ? ”
480691	480707	480685	480685	Adam	700	“ We do n’t know yet . God , we do n’t know anything yet . ”
480708	480715	480716	480716	I	884	“ I ’ll be right there . ”
480743	480750	480732	480732	I	884	“ Alayna . I need you . ”
480751	480756	480716	480716	I	884	“ What is it ? ”
480769	480779	480780	480780	I	884	“ Mira . At the hospital . The baby … ”
480789	480796	480732	480732	I	884	“ I ’ll be right there . ”
480797	480808	480809	480809	I	884	“ Jordan ’s already on his way to get you . ”
481527	481536	481523	481523	Patricia	9246	“ Mirabelle Sitkin on the line for you . ”
481548	481553	481554	481554	I	884	“ Send it back . ”
481591	481607	481554	481554	I	884	“ Mirabelle , are n’t I supposed to be the one checking up on you ? ”
481608	481617	481618	481618	Her	10263	“ That ’s exactly why I ’m calling . ”
481625	481634	481618	481618	Her	10263	“ Adam says you ’ve been harassing him . ”
481635	481647	481554	481554	I	884	“ Harassing ? That ’s a fine description for brotherly concern . ”
481648	481659	481660	481660	She	10263	“ And I adore the concern . I really do . ”
481666	481692	481660	481660	She	10263	“ But between you and Mom and Dad and Adam … I think a once - a - day friendly text will do just fine . ”
481708	481736	481693	481693	I	884	“ You know , if you ’d let me hire a nurse to follow you around like I suggested , I would n’t need to check in . ”
481737	481756	481693	481693	I	884	“ Hudson , I do n’t need a nurse . I ’m married to a doctor . Remember ? ”
481767	481792	481757	481757	I	884	“ And you were married to a doctor when you were admitted to the hospital three nights ago . It ’s obviously not enough . ”
481793	481803	481693	481693	I	884	“ Oh , my God . Are you serious ? ”
481804	481807	481808	481808	I	884	“ Very . ”
481822	481840	481808	481808	I	884	“ But if you say you ’re fine and promise me that you ’re drinking and resting — ”
481841	481846	481808	481808	I	884	“ — I am ! ”
481847	481861	481808	481808	I	884	“ Then I ’ll agree to one call and one text a day . ”
481916	481919	481920	481920	she	6317	“ Deal , ”
481923	481943	481920	481920	she	6317	“ I ’m glad we got that worked out . But that is n’t really why I ’m calling . ”
481944	481947	481950	481950	I	884	“ Oh ? ”
481985	481992	481998	481998	she	6317	“ Nope . You and Laynie … ”
482218	482225	482206	482206	I	884	“ I fucked up , Mirabelle . ”
482232	482238	482239	482239	Her	10263	“ What did you do ? ”
482292	482298	482286	482286	I	884	“ I lied to her . ”
482299	482305	482306	482306	She	10263	“ And she found out ? ”
482320	482343	482344	482344	I	884	“ Yes . She found out . But there ’s more I have n’t told her , more I need to say . ”
482394	482397	482398	482398	She	10263	“ Okay . ”
482414	482427	482398	482398	She	10263	“ So you need to tell her , but you have n’t ? ”
482428	482431	482398	482398	She	10263	“ No . ”
482432	482441	482398	482398	She	10263	“ Because you ’re afraid of … what ? ”
482442	482446	482398	482398	She	10263	“ Losing her . ”
482456	482471	482398	482398	She	10263	“ But you wo n’t know that unless you tell her . Will you ? ”
482593	482606	482590	482590	Mirabelle	1120	“ Your silence leads me to believe you are n’t going to . ”
482615	482631	482590	482590	Mirabelle	1120	“ Not true . My silence is only a product of not having a response . ”
482632	482637	482638	482638	She	1120	“ Well , then . ”
482656	482663	482653	482653	she	1120	“ Do you want my advice ? ”
482664	482678	482653	482653	she	1120	“ If I say no , will you refrain from giving it anyway ? ”
482679	482683	482684	482684	She	1120	“ Probably not . ”
482687	482691	482684	482684	She	1120	“ Definitely not . ”
482692	482701	482702	482702	I	884	“ Then by all means , go ahead . ”
482722	482736	482737	482737	She	1120	“ I ’m not going to ask what you ’re keeping from her . ”
482755	482934	482747	482747	She	1120	“ If it ’s something you do n’t want to tell her , I ’m sure it ’s not something you want to tell me . But , I know that you could tell me anything , and I would still love you . And not just because I ’m your sister . And though it ’s hard to admit this , I kinda get the sense that Laynie loves you even more than I do . She chose you . Out of everyone out there who she could love or who could love her , she chose you , Hudson . I have to believe she sees that thing about you too . That thing you think does n’t exist . That thing that makes all your bull worth it . And if she sees that , if she loves that as much as I think she does ? Then I do n’t think there ’s anything you can say that will make you lose her . Even if it ’s the ugliest secret of all time . ”
482935	482947	482948	482948	Her	6326	“ Even if it ’s the worst betrayal you can imagine ? ”
482985	482997	482981	482981	Mirabelle	1120	“ Did I ever tell you that I cheated on Adam ? ”
482998	483003	483004	483004	I	884	“ Uh , no . ”
483014	483032	482981	482981	Mirabelle	1120	“ A long time ago . Before we were even engaged . I slept with another guy . ”
483048	483060	483037	483037	Mirabelle	1120	“ I do n’t know if I want to hear this . ”
483066	483159	483061	483061	She	6326	“ I was stupid . But it was really shitty . I mean , he knew the guy . They were roommates in their undergrad program . And we were serious at the time — Adam and I. I just … I do n’t know . It was stupid . I did something stupid . And for stupid reasons too . I wanted to get Adam ’s attention . Can you believe that ? Well , it sure got his attention . Also , almost lost me the love of my life . ”
483160	483163	483164	483164	I	884	“ Mirabelle … ”
483172	483218	483219	483219	She	6327	“ No , no , it ’s fine now . The point is that fidelity is important in any relationship , but even more so for Adam because his previous girlfriend cheated , and , well , that ’s a whole other story . Anyway . ”
483225	483265	483219	483219	She	6327	“ Cheating is the ultimate betrayal for him . And we worked things out . It was n’t easy , but here we are . So , yeah , I believe forgiveness happens . Even in the Pierce family . ”
483320	483334	483313	483313	I	884	“ Thank you for telling me that . It does give some perspective . ”
483335	483352	483353	483353	God	8844	“ Hudson , do n’t just smile and nod and then dismiss everything I ’m saying . ”
483361	483480	483353	483353	God	8844	“ Because here ’s the other thing . Lies like those ? They grow . They grow between you like big black holes . Pretty soon you ca n’t see each other through the darkness . And that part of you that Laynie loves ? She wo n’t be able to find it anymore through the cloud . In other words , you can tell her the truth and give her the chance to prove she loves you anyway . Or you can let the lie grow until she leaves you because she does n’t know who you are anymore . It may be just me , but I think you have a better shot with the truth . ”
483686	483694	483674	483674	I	884	“ Why would she be with me ? ”
483700	483719	483695	483695	Jordan	655	“ I dropped her off about twenty minutes ago . She said she was going to surprise you . ”
483728	483736	483695	483695	Jordan	655	“ Well , she ’s not here . ”
483737	483745	483746	483746	Jordan	655	“ She ’s somewhere in the building , ”
483749	483760	483746	483746	Jordan	655	“ I ’ve been sitting out front this whole time . ”
483805	483816	483796	483796	I	884	“ Stay on the line while I check the loft . ”
483853	483875	483848	483848	I	884	“ You ’re supposed to report whenever she goes anywhere . Why did n’t you tell me when you got here ? ”
483876	483900	483901	483901	Jordan	655	“ She asked me to give her a few minutes . After that , I figured you would have already worked it out . ”
483909	483918	483901	483901	Jordan	655	“ Do you want me to come up ? ”
483919	483930	483931	483931	I	884	“ No . Stay out there . Watch the doors . ”
483979	483985	483986	483986	I	884	“ She ’s not here , ”
483997	484026	483992	483992	I	884	“ I ’m checking the live camera feeds . Contact security and have them review the last half hour ’s tapes . See if we can trace her . ”
484191	484199	484200	484200	he	655	“ We found her on your floor , ”
484203	484222	484200	484200	he	655	“ It seems she went to another office . Uh , getting the name now . It ’s — ”
484223	484228	484229	484229	I	884	“ — Norma Anders , ”
484260	484266	484247	484247	I	884	“ Is she still there ? ”
484267	484276	484242	484242	I	884	“ There ’s no sign that she left . ”
484277	484292	484293	484293	I	884	“ Thank you , Jordan . I ’ll take care of it from here . ”
484554	484557	484548	484548	she	10443	“ Alayna . ”
484694	484704	484686	484686	her	10443	“ Let ’s talk in private , shall we ? ”
484768	484774	484759	484759	She	10443	“ Well , hello , H. ”
484786	484795	484781	484781	I	884	“ What are you doing here , Alayna ? ”
484796	484814	484815	484815	She	10443	“ What am I doing here in your office ? You dragged me in here , remember ? ”
484849	484861	484834	484834	I	884	“ Do n’t be cute . I meant in the building . ”
484883	484903	484872	484872	I	884	“ Maybe I came to see you . I tend to stalk when I feel dismissed by a man . ”
484921	484949	484918	484918	I	884	“ You did n’t come to see me . You arrived on this floor over half an hour ago and are just now coming by my office . ”
484955	484972	484950	484950	She	8844	“ How the fuck do you know everything I do ? Jordan ? Your security cameras ? ”
484973	484995	484996	484996	I	884	“ I ’m not going to feel guilty for the lengths I go to in order to protect what ’s mine . ”
485094	485097	485085	485085	I	884	“ Alayna ? ”
485110	485121	485098	485098	She	8844	“ Yours , huh ? Do n’t make me laugh . ”
485122	485138	485139	485139	I	884	“ Jesus , how many times do I have to go through this with you ? ”
485165	485186	485147	485147	She	8844	“ I do n’t know . Maybe a couple hundred more times . Because I ’m obviously not getting it . ”
485256	485265	485243	485243	I	884	“ Why . Are . You . Here ? ”
485266	485273	485276	485276	she	8844	“ I came to see Norma . ”
485280	485284	485276	485276	she	8844	“ About Gwen ? ”
485303	485321	485300	485300	she	8844	“ About you , you dummy . I do n’t give a shit about anything but you . ”
485327	485343	485300	485300	she	8844	“ Jesus , how many times do I have to go through this with you ? ”
485351	485362	485344	485344	Her	8844	“ You came to talk to my employee about me ? ”
485426	485437	485415	485415	She	8844	“ Do n’t guilt me for protecting what ’s mine . ”
485519	485533	485534	485534	she	8844	“ I only wanted to see for myself if she was into you , ”
485540	485549	485534	485534	she	8844	“ If you had something going with her . ”
485558	485588	485551	485551	she	8844	“ And do n’t you dare talk to me about trust because you know I get jealous about her , and you are n’t around to help reassure me . ”
485618	485627	485614	485614	I	884	“ Did you get what you came for ? ”
485632	485636	485641	485641	She	8844	“ I did . ”
485637	485640	485641	485641	She	8844	“ And ? ”
485654	485685	485641	485641	She	8844	“ She thinks a lot of you . She respects you and admires you , and she recognizes you ’re physically attractive — don’t let that go to your head . ”
485686	485689	485641	485641	She	8844	“ But … ”
485690	485707	485641	485641	She	8844	“ But she ’s not into you anymore . I can see it in her eyes . ”
485735	485738	485722	485722	I	884	“ Good . ”
485753	485764	485722	485722	I	884	“ Then you believe the things I ’ve told you . ”
485765	485790	485818	485818	She	10443	“ It was never the things you ’ve told me that were the issue . It ’s the things you have n’t told me . ”
485791	485800	485722	485722	I	884	“ They are n’t your things to know . ”
485825	485890	485818	485818	She	10443	“ What the ever - living fuck ? I could say the same thing about you — spying on me , digging into my history before you ’d even met me — maybe I think those are n’t your things to know . Still , you did — and do — whatever the hell you want with no regard to boundaries or personal space . ”
485897	485928	485891	485891	She	10443	“ And while that ’s out there , let me be clear — since you are n’t able to explain things to me , I ’m digging on my own . ”
485944	486000	485939	485939	she	10443	“ That ’s right . I ’ve been through all of the books Celia sent . I ’ve been to see Stacy . And Norma . I ’m collecting my own facts . Do n’t you think it would be better to tell me your secrets than have me find them out on my own ? ”
486001	486007	486008	486008	I	884	“ Alayna , stop digging . ”
486037	486048	486008	486008	I	884	“ You ’re protecting Celia again , are n’t you ? ”
486057	486066	486050	486050	she	10443	“ Celia ’s not who I ’m protecting . ”
486067	486075	486008	486008	I	884	“ Who then ? Yourself ? Me ? ”
486152	486160	486139	486139	she	10443	“ You need to leave , now . ”
486201	486218	486219	486219	Her	10443	“ Shutting me out again . Like you always do . Hiding behind your thick walls . ”
486224	486256	486219	486219	Her	10443	“ What ’s the point of me even fighting for you if you ’re never , never going to let me in ? Who are you protecting , Hudson ? Who ? ”
486283	486298	486272	486272	I	884	“ Yes , you , dammit ! I ’m protecting you . Always you . ”
486915	486929	486894	486894	Alayna	8844	“ Oh god , I miss you . I miss you so much . ”
486930	486939	486940	486940	I	884	“ Précieux … mon amour … ma chérie … ”
486976	486981	486985	486985	us	6362	“ When are you coming home?”she
487017	487028	487029	487029	I	884	“ I have to go to L.A. for the weekend . ”
487034	487048	487029	487029	I	884	“ I ’m set to leave in about twenty minutes , in fact . ”
487049	487060	487068	487068	her	10443	“ Part of your big business thing ? With Norma ? ”
487084	487104	487077	487077	I	884	“ Yes , with Norma . And after this , if all goes well , we ’ll be done . ”
487359	487371	487346	487346	her	10443	“ God , Alayna , I ca n’t do this anymore . ”
487383	487400	487346	487346	her	10443	“ I ca n’t bear to be apart from you . I miss you so terribly . ”
487401	487405	487406	487406	She	10443	“ You do ? ”
487438	487462	487406	487406	She	10443	“ Of course , I do , precious . You ’re my everything . I love you . I love you so much . ”
487485	487492	487493	487493	She	10443	“ W - w - what ? ”
487503	487508	487493	487493	She	10443	“ You heard me . ”
487509	487517	487478	487478	her	10443	“ I want to hear it again . ”
487518	487523	487493	487493	She	10443	“ I love you . ”
487577	487582	487583	487583	I	884	“ You love me ? ”
487590	487620	487583	487583	I	884	“ I love you , precious . I ’ve always loved you . From the moment I first saw you . I knew before you did , I think . ”
487630	487679	487583	487583	I	884	“ But there are things — things in my past — that have kept me from being able to tell you . And now … I have to do this … this thing . Finish this deal . Then , when I get back , we ’ll talk . ”
487680	487685	487686	487686	She	10443	“ We ’ll talk ? ”
487710	487733	487705	487705	I	884	“ I ’ll tell you anything you want to know . And if you still want me , I ’ll come home . ”
487734	487773	487806	487806	she	10443	“ Yes , I want you home . Of course I do . We belong there together . There ’s nothing you could say that would make me stop loving you . Nothing . I stick , remember ? ”
487786	487797	487774	487774	I	884	“ Oh , precious . I hope that ’s true . ”
487798	487802	487774	487774	I	884	“ It is . ”
487821	487826	487852	487852	She	10443	“ Say it again . ”
487827	487835	487836	487836	I	884	“ You ’re such a spoiled girl . ”
487843	487851	487836	487836	I	884	“ And I love … spoiling you . ”
487857	487863	487864	487864	I	884	“ And I love you . ”
487933	487946	487913	487913	I	884	“ I love you , I love you . I love you . ”
488119	488121	488108	488108	He	452	“ game ”
488183	488201	488178	488178	I	884	“ It ’s not that I miss playing . Well , not only that I miss playing . ”
488301	488313	488314	488315	Dr. Alberts	452	“ Then what is it that keeps you from letting go ? ”
488329	488335	488336	488336	I	884	“ I do n’t know . ”
488345	488357	488336	488336	I	884	“ It ’s just … who am I without the game ? ”
488425	488455	488422	488422	he	452	“ That ’s what we have to figure out , Hudson . Luckily , you ’re young and healthy . You have plenty of time to figure it out . ”
488535	488538	488545	488546	Dr. Alberts	452	“ But , ”
488548	488570	488545	488546	Dr. Alberts	452	“ you will never be able to fully explore the future you if you are still firmly anchored in the past . ”
488653	488656	488663	488663	her	9246	“ Celia . ”
488695	488703	488688	488688	I	884	“ I ’ll take care of it . ”
488859	488893	488853	488854	Dr. Alberts	452	“ If you were truly incapable of affection , then how did your sister manage to convince you to see me ? Was it not because of affection for her that you agreed ? ”
488968	488977	488981	488981	her	1120	“ You are connected to her , Hudson . ”
488997	489042	488983	488984	Dr. Alberts	452	“ It may not be the form of love that you imagine when you think of the word , but there is emotional involvement . It will not be easy to cut her from your life . You need to be prepared for that . ”
489136	489144	489131	489131	our	6385	“ I ’ll be there after dinner . ”
489147	489159	489131	489131	our	6385	“ I ’ll stop by on my way to the gym . ”
489252	489257	489258	489258	Celia	9246	“ Hey , stranger . ”
489300	489305	489293	489293	She	9246	“ Come on in . ”
489429	489451	489452	489452	She	9246	“ Well , are we just going to stand here twiddling our thumbs or would you like to take a seat ? ”
489467	489473	489474	489474	I	884	“ Sit , of course . ”
489481	489489	489452	489452	She	9246	“ Can I get you a drink ? ”
489490	489493	489494	489494	I	884	“ Sure . ”
489497	489505	489494	489494	I	884	“ Actually , I ’ll get it . ”
489530	489538	489539	489539	Celia	9246	“ I do n’t have any Scotch , ”
489546	489549	489539	489539	Celia	9246	“ Sorry . ”
489550	489554	489555	489555	I	884	“ No problem . ”
489664	489667	489668	489668	She	442	“ So . ”
489676	489727	489668	489668	She	442	“ What ’s up ? I mean , I know something has to be up . You ’ve been avoiding me for weeks , and all this tonight is just … weird . You ’re trying to throw me off balance . It ’s working . So what is it ? ”
489771	489784	489785	489785	Just	510	“ I came to tell you … I need to tell you … ”
489790	489797	489785	489785	Just	510	“ I ’m not playing anymore . ”
489806	489871	489800	489800	Celia	9246	“ Of course you are n’t . We have n’t seen each other in forever . How could you possibly be playing ? I ’m sure it ’s driving you crazy . You ’re such a junkie for this stuff . Do n’t worry . I have several possible scenarios just waiting for you to choose one . We ’ll get you back in . ”
489889	489944	489872	489872	She	9246	“ There ’s a new neighbor on the seventh floor . He ’s seeing two women , neither know about each other . He ’s serious about both . We could introduce them . Or you could try to seduce one . Or both . Or I could jump in as a third woman . ”
489972	489978	489965	489965	I	884	“ Celia , I mean — ”
489987	490036	489979	489979	She	9246	“ If that does n’t sound appealing , then I have another . I met a pair of newlyweds at the MoMA show last week . I know , we ’ve done the newlywed thing , but I thought it might be fun for old time ’s sake . ”
490037	490050	489979	489979	She	9246	“ I ’m out , Celia . I ’m not playing anymore . ”
490051	490055	489979	489979	She	9246	“ Or wait ! ”
490075	490100	490068	490068	She	9246	“ Andrea Parish has a wedding shower coming up . It ’s co - ed . I ’m sure there ’s something we could — ”
490101	490106	490068	490068	She	9246	“ Celia , stop . ”
490121	490135	490136	490136	My	884	“ I ’m done . I ’m not playing the game . Ever . ”
490149	490154	490143	490143	I	884	“ It ’s over . ”
490184	490201	490181	490181	she	9246	“ What happened ? Is there a lawsuit ? We always knew that was a possibility . ”
490207	490220	490202	490202	I	884	“ There ’s no lawsuit . I ’m just … I’m done . ”
490221	490226	490227	490227	She	9246	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
490233	490254	490227	490227	She	9246	“ Are you trying to pull my leg ? I do n’t fall for your shit anymore , you know . ”
490295	490353	490287	490287	I	884	“ I ’m not pulling your leg , Celia . I ’m not making this up . I ’m done with the game . I ’m no longer playing . I know this seems to be coming out of the blue , but I ’m serious about this . No more experiments . No game . Done . ”
490362	490377	490354	490354	She	9246	“ You ca n’t be done . You said you ’d never be done . ”
490378	490399	490354	490354	She	9246	“ I ’d said that ; you ’re right . But I was wrong . I ’ve changed my mind . ”
490459	490469	490448	490448	She	9246	“ Is this because of your mother ? Jack ? ”
490470	490484	490448	490448	She	9246	“ No . Not because of Sophia . Definitely not because of Jack . ”
490491	490514	490485	490485	Celia	9246	“ Where the hell is this coming from , then ? If not your family , did you meet Jesus or something ? ”
490519	490522	490515	490515	I	884	“ No . ”
490556	490566	490546	490546	I	884	“ This is me , Celia . All me . ”
490573	490586	490567	490567	She	9246	“ Bullshit . This is n’t you . The game is you . ”
490587	490591	490567	490567	She	9246	“ Not anymore . ”
490592	490613	490567	490567	She	9246	“ Always ! You ca n’t even make it through a dinner without coming up with at least one play . ”
490621	490684	490614	490614	I	884	“ And that ’s exactly the problem . The game has become my whole life . To the point that I ’ve begun to ruin the few things around me that are n’t the game . And still it is n’t enough . It ’s never enough . I need something else . Something more fulfilling , less consuming . More honest . ”
490685	490703	490704	490704	She	9246	“ Like what ? Love ? Because I swear to God if that ’s what you mean … ”
490740	490749	490704	490704	She	9246	“ Not love . Of course not love . ”
490783	490824	490778	490778	Celia	9246	“ You know I ’m incapable of that , Celia . Just … there has to be something else . If I knew what that something was , I ’d tell you . But I do n’t know . Yet . ”
490825	490832	490878	490878	She	1120	“ Because there is nothing else . ”
490864	490877	490857	490857	Mirabelle	1120	“ How do we know that , Celia ? Have we looked ? ”
490883	490891	490878	490878	She	1120	“ I do n’t need to look . ”
490892	490899	490878	490878	She	1120	“ Then how do you know ? ”
490900	490906	490878	490878	She	1120	“ Because you told me ! ”
490907	490917	490878	490878	She	1120	“ Only because you begged me to teach you ! ”
490974	491011	490967	490967	I	884	“ Look , you chose this . I never did . I thought it was my only option , but I see now that it was n’t . So I ’m trying to choose something different . ”
491022	491044	490967	490967	I	884	“ I stood by you when you made this choice , and now it ’s your turn to stand by me . ”
491062	491094	491045	491045	She	9246	“ If we ’re scoring points then we need to go back much further , Hudson . Your game against me that summer was what began this in the first place . ”
491213	491237	491203	491203	I	884	“ You ’re right , Ceely . I did begin this . I wish I knew what to do now to end it . ”
491276	491290	491266	491266	she	9246	“ I do n’t want to end it . I ’m not ready . ”
491419	491446	491409	491409	I	884	“ Then you do n’t have to . You ’re free to do whatever you want . I ’m not about to try to stop you . ”
491465	491473	491454	491454	She	9246	“ I really was n’t expecting this . ”
491474	491480	491409	491409	I	884	“ Honestly , neither was I. ”
491512	491524	491504	491504	she	9246	“ I was supposed to be the one who quit first . ”
491538	491547	491525	491525	I	884	“ Because you wanted to leave me behind ? ”
491556	491563	491548	491548	She	9246	“ Maybe a bit of that . ”
491597	491625	491592	491592	I	884	“ I ’m sorry for … things I ’ve done . To you , I mean . I ’m hoping that one day you can forgive me . ”
491637	491658	491626	491626	She	9246	“ Is this like AA where you ask for forgiveness from those you ’ve wronged ? Are you in therapy ? ”
491674	491678	491659	491659	I	884	“ I am . ”
491679	491682	491683	491683	She	9246	“ Oh . ”
491696	491709	491683	491683	She	9246	“ You ’re not supposed to see me anymore , are you ? ”
491710	491714	491715	491715	I	884	“ I ’m … ”
491816	491835	491811	491811	I	884	“ Hey , I ’m quitting the game . That does n’t mean I have to quit you . ”
491841	491857	491836	491836	Her	9246	“ Even if I decide to still play ? Wo n’t I be a temptation ? ”
491858	491865	491836	491836	Her	9246	“ Maybe I want the temptation . ”
491877	491882	491866	491866	Her	9246	“ Do you really ? ”
491894	491922	491887	491887	I	884	“ I do n’t know . I do n’t know what I want , Celia . This is n’t easy for me . I ’m flying blind . ”
491923	491931	491866	491866	Her	9246	“ And that ’s not like you . ”
491932	491939	491887	491887	I	884	“ No , it ’s not . ”
492015	492112	491998	491998	She	9246	“ Here ’s what I think , and go ahead and bitch at me if it ’s not what you want to hear . I think this is a phase you ’re going through . It ’s something you have to try . I get that . But you ’re going to realize that you ca n’t stay away . The game is n’t just what you do ; it ’s who you are . So go ahead and do this , this therapy thing . And when you ’re ready , I ’ll be here . ”
492173	492182	492183	492183	I	884	“ You might be waiting a long time , ”
492186	492191	492183	492183	I	884	“ Full disclosure here . ”
492192	492197	492156	492156	She	9246	“ We ’ll see . ”
492201	492210	492198	492198	I	884	“ Then you ’re going to keep playing ? ”
492211	492222	492183	492183	I	884	“ I think I am . Is that all right ? ”
492226	492238	492280	492280	She	9246	“ I said it was . I ’m not your keeper . ”
492292	492303	492280	492280	She	9246	“ What do you want me to do , Hudson ? ”
492336	492353	492329	492329	I	884	“ I want you to do what ’s best for you . For once . Honestly . ”
492354	492361	492362	492362	She	9246	“ Then I ’m still playing . ”
492365	492382	492362	492362	She	9246	“ And do n’t be surprised if I try to tempt you back to my ways . ”
492383	492394	492329	492329	I	884	“ Hey , that was n’t part of the deal . ”
492403	492414	492395	492395	She	9246	“ You said you wanted what was best for me . ”
492420	492458	492416	492416	she	9246	“ Best for me is to have you with me , Hudson . With me in the game , I mean . You ’ve said I ca n’t have that . But I have to keep trying . ”
492480	492488	492538	492538	We	6405	“ That ’s fair , I suppose . ”
492489	492493	492538	492538	We	6405	“ Is it ? ”
492494	492515	492538	492538	We	6405	“ Does it matter if it is or is n’t ? You ’ll go after what you want either way . ”
492516	492519	492520	492520	She	9246	“ True . ”
492523	492537	492520	492520	She	9246	“ And you just said you want me to have what I want . ”
492772	492780	492781	492781	I	884	“ I have to go , Ceely . ”
492789	492815	492781	492781	I	884	“ But , yes , I do want you to have what you want . I hope that someday you want something different than this . ”
492825	492829	492816	492816	She	9246	“ How patronizing . ”
492833	492848	492830	492830	I	884	“ I ’m not trying to patronize . I ’m trying to be honest . ”
492849	492861	492866	492866	She	9246	“ If we ’re being honest , can I ask something ? ”
492862	492865	492830	492830	I	884	“ Sure . ”
492877	492890	492866	492866	She	9246	“ Would blackmail work ? To keep you playing , I mean . ”
492913	492925	492926	492926	I	884	“ Well , that really is honest , is n’t it ? ”
493000	493019	492988	492988	I	884	“ I believe I have as much on you , Celia , as you could have on me . ”
493028	493039	493025	493025	her	9246	“ Then we ’re agreed — our secrets are safe ? ”
493040	493054	493025	493025	her	9246	“ As long as it ’s mutual , then my lips are sealed . ”
493055	493061	493025	493025	her	9246	“ Then mine are too . ”
493270	493274	493276	493276	I	884	“ off hours , ”
493992	494004	494005	494005	I	884	“ Maybe we should discuss this in a more private setting , ”
494024	494047	494058	494058	her	1124	“ He kissed me , Hudson . I did n’t kiss him . And when he did , I pushed him away . ”
494067	494079	494055	494055	her	1124	“ Why were you in his arms in the first place ? ”
494080	494090	494055	494055	her	1124	“ We were dancing . It was a party . ”
494091	494124	494125	494125	I	884	“ You were in his arms , Alayna . In the arms of someone who has made no secret of his feelings for you . What did you think he ’d do ? ”
494172	494177	494178	494178	she	1124	“ It was innocent , ”
494181	494195	494196	494196	Her	1124	“ I needed someone . He was here . And you were n’t . ”
494206	494219	494196	494196	Her	1124	“ Where were you today , anyway ? When I needed you ? ”
494242	494257	494234	494234	My	884	“ What was it you needed , Alayna ? Someone to keep you warm ? ”
494264	494268	494258	494258	She	1124	“ That hurts . ”
494269	494276	494277	494277	I	884	“ What I just witnessed hurts . ”
494339	494348	494334	494334	She	1124	“ Yeah , I know how it feels . ”
494349	494353	494334	494334	She	1124	“ Do you ? ”
494354	494410	494334	494334	She	1124	“ Yeah , I do . Let me see if I can explain it . It feels like your gut has been wrenched out of your body . At least that ’s what it felt like when Celia told me that you ’d been fucking her for most of the time we ’ve been together . ”
494420	494423	494411	494411	I	884	“ What ? ”
494443	494450	494434	494434	I	884	“ When did she say that ? ”
494455	494461	494451	494451	She	1124	“ You saw her today ? ”
494656	494665	494666	494666	Alayna	8844	“ Then she said that you were together , ”
494670	494699	494666	494666	Alayna	8844	“ That you were a couple . That you fucked her that night , and it was n’t the first time , and it was n’t the last . ”
494700	494706	494646	494646	she	8844	“ And you believed her ? ”
494747	494758	494743	494743	Alayna	8844	“ It pissed me off enough that I punched her . ”
494759	494764	494765	494765	Alayna	8844	“ You punched her ? ”
494768	494788	494765	494765	Alayna	8844	“ You know what ? Keep acting like this is an interrogation , and I ’m out of here . ”
494912	494937	494906	494906	I	884	“ I ’m sorry if I sound a bit tense , Alayna . I assure you it ’s only out of concern for you . ”
495132	495136	495137	495137	Her	8844	“ Thank you . ”
495165	495168	495157	495157	She	8844	“ Hudson . ”
495173	495178	495157	495157	She	8844	“ I ’m sorry . ”
495179	495194	495195	495195	I	884	“ Do n’t be . Good for you , actually . She deserves worse . ”
495229	495239	495226	495226	Alayna	8844	“ I mean , I ’m sorry about David . ”
495240	495243	495244	495244	I	884	“ Oh . ”
495269	495283	495266	495266	I	884	“ Tell me one thing — do you still feel anything for him ? ”
495284	495373	495394	495394	her	442	“ No . No , I do n’t . Nothing . I ’ve told you that before , and I meant it , though I ’m sure it does n’t seem like it seeing me tonight . But the whole time he was holding me , it felt wrong . All I could think about was you . I was missing you , H. Needing you . So much . And I did n’t think about what I was doing . I ’m so , so , sor — ”
495400	495419	495389	495389	I	884	“ I missed you too , precious . Needed you . I was trying to get back here — ”
495425	495437	495420	495420	She	442	“ And I ruined your surprise . I ’m so sorry . ”
495438	495464	495420	495420	She	442	“ I do n’t care . It hurts , but I ’ve hurt you . And as long as you swear that he means nothing — ”
495465	495482	495483	495483	She	442	“ Nothing . I swear with every fiber of my body , it ’s only you . ”
495548	495561	495545	495545	she	442	“ How about you ? Do you still feel anything for Celia ? ”
495609	495619	495601	495601	I	884	“ Alayna … I’ve never felt anything for Celia . ”
495620	495629	495652	495652	She	442	“ You mean , it was just sex ? ”
495635	495645	495630	495630	I	884	“ I ’ve never been with her at all . ”
495646	495651	495601	495601	I	884	“ She was lying . ”
495662	495667	495652	495652	She	442	“ She was lying . ”
495668	495675	495652	495652	She	442	“ That ’s what I thought . ”
495700	495707	495708	495708	she	442	“ But here ’s the thing , ”
495711	495720	495708	495708	she	442	“ I sort of wish it were true . ”
495769	495863	495760	495760	I	884	“ Not that you were sleeping with her while we were together — not that part . But the rest of it — that you were really with her when Stacy saw you . If that was the truth , I could accept it . Do n’t get me wrong — the idea of you with her , fucking her — it torments me . It really does . But I think I always knew you were never with her . It ’s in your eyes — both now and in that video . ”
495867	495878	495864	495864	I	884	“ I was n’t . I was never with her . ”
495879	495939	495864	495864	I	884	“ And that means that the thing with Stacy was a scam . Of course it was . I wanted to think it was just Celia in on it , and you were protecting her . But you said you were n’t , and you did go along enough to stage that kiss . You were part of it . ”
496012	496092	496007	496007	her	6438	“ I thought for a minute that might be your secret . Except it ’s not it . I mean , yeah , that ’s shitty that you did that to her , but I knew you had those things in your past . And you knew that I knew those things . If that were all there was to learn from that video , you would have told me . There had to be more you were hiding . ”
496139	496193	496132	496132	Alayna	8844	“ It ’s because of what night it was , the night of the symposium , is n’t it ? I considered that you did n’t want me to know that you were still manipulating people for fun that recently , but now I do n’t think that ’s all of it either . ”
496194	496197	496132	496132	Alayna	8844	“ Alayna … ”
496303	496317	496322	496322	I	884	“ It ’s not the video itself . It ’s what happened after . ”
496318	496321	496322	496322	I	884	“ Alayna , ”
496345	496395	496322	496322	I	884	“ If Celia was there with you outside the symposium … then does n’t it make sense that she went in with you ? And if she went in with you , she was there when you first saw me . And if you were still playing people together … ”
496439	496454	496430	496430	Her	6438	“ I was going to tell you . I came back to tell you . ”
496479	496488	496489	496489	I	884	“ It ’s my worst mistake , Alayna . ”
496494	496566	496489	496489	I	884	“ The most horrible of all the things I ’ve done . My biggest regret , although it ’s what gave me you , and for that I ’m forever grateful . But I never knew what I ’d feel for you . I never knew that I could hurt you that much , and that I would care that I did . Please , Alayna , you have to understand . ”
496600	496619	496620	496620	She	6438	“ That ’s what I was , was n’t I ? A game . Your game . Together . ”
496626	496636	496620	496620	She	6438	“ Oh God . Oh God , oh God . ”
496637	496640	496641	496641	I	884	“ Alayna — ”
496672	496678	496668	496668	she	6438	“ Do n’t touch me ! ”
496747	496788	496740	496740	my	884	“ It was n’t what you think , Alayna . Yes , it started as a game . As Celia ’s game . But I only went along because it was you . Because I was so enamored with you . ”
496855	496861	496848	496848	she	6438	“ Alayna , let me — ”
496874	496882	496862	496862	She	6438	“ I do n’t want your help . ”
496894	496900	496883	496883	She	6438	“ I want fucking answers . ”
496901	496913	496924	496924	she	6438	“ Anything . I told you I ’d tell you anything . ”
497074	497089	497066	497066	she	6438	“ This is unforgiveable , Hudson . There is no moving forward from this . ”
497148	497160	497213	497213	she	6438	“ Do n’t say that . Do n’t ever say that . ”
497161	497187	497188	497188	She	6438	“ What is it exactly that you do n’t want to hear , Hudson ? That I ca n’t forgive you ? I ca n’t . ”
497200	497209	497188	497188	She	6438	“ I ca n’t forgive this . Ever . ”
497224	497229	497219	497219	I	884	“ Alayna , please ! ”
497535	497542	497525	497525	He	180	“ Are you okay , Laynie ? ”
497550	497558	497543	497543	She	8844	“ No . I ’m not okay . ”
497581	497584	497569	497569	I	884	“ Alayna … ”
497600	497605	497606	497606	I	884	“ I ’ll leave . ”
497623	497643	497618	497618	I	884	“ I ’m sorry to put a damper on your party . Thank you for looking out for her . ”
497977	497986	497987	497987	she	8844	“ She does n’t want to hear that , ”
497990	498000	497969	497969	she	8844	“ It does n’t make it any less true . ”
498291	498299	498300	498300	I	884	“ She taught me how to feel , ”
498315	498324	498300	498300	I	884	“ She taught me how to have emotions . ”
498336	498400	498325	498326	Dr. Alberts	452	“ She did n’t teach you . You always knew how . You worked hard all this time trying to forget that . But you were never incapable . You created blocks when you were young to deal with the heartache that surrounded your family life . You did n’t feel because it was easier not to . It was a coping mechanism . ”
498492	498538	498539	498539	I	884	“ You were n’t ready to hear it . The question is , why do you think that you decided to let yourself now ? You saw this woman from afar , and immediately , you were ready to take the first steps . Why ? ”
498578	498583	498584	498584	I	884	“ She was familiar , ”
498589	498627	498584	498584	I	884	“ I recognized that she ’d struggled . And yet she ’d come out okay . It was beautiful about her , and I wanted to get to know it more . I wanted that for myself . ”
498628	498644	498584	498584	I	884	“ And you realized to get that , you had to start to feel again . ”
498645	498650	498584	498584	I	884	“ I guess so . ”
498702	498729	498689	498689	I	884	“ I ’d been okay without playing people anymore . Why did I decide that I had to play the game to get close to Alayna ? ”
498741	498747	498730	498730	He	452	“ Why do you think ? ”
498748	498762	498730	498730	He	452	“ Because I did n’t know any other way to relate to people . ”
498774	498783	498784	498784	He	452	“ I imagine there ’s truth to that . ”
498790	498848	498784	498784	He	452	“ And you liked to do it , Hudson . Maybe you do n’t anymore — it sounds like you ’ve overcome that addiction — but you did . The rush it gave you was a substitute for the real emotions that you ’d buried inside . You manipulated Alayna because a part of you wanted to . ”
498981	499046	498974	498975	Dr. Alberts	452	“ Acceptance is the first step to moving on , Hudson . It ’s why you could never fully recover before — because you never really accepted the blame for your actions . This is great progress . Talking about it , sharing what you ’ve done with those close to you will help as well . I recommend you work on that next . ”
499226	499236	499237	499237	I	884	“ I ’m guessing you ’ve talked to her , ”
499254	499261	499250	499250	Her	1120	“ Talked to who ? Mom ? ”
499262	499269	499270	499270	I	884	“ No , I meant Alayna . ”
499294	499302	499270	499270	I	884	“ Are n’t you here about her ? ”
499303	499308	499309	499309	Her	1120	“ I am now . ”
499314	499320	499309	499309	Her	1120	“ What ’s going on ? ”
499352	499358	499344	499344	I	884	“ Forget I said anything . ”
499359	499367	499368	499368	She	1120	“ Uh , that ’s not happening . ”
499379	499382	499383	499383	I	884	“ Hudson ? ”
499397	499408	499393	499393	she	1120	“ Oh , God . What happened ? Tell me . ”
499409	499412	499413	499413	I	884	“ She … ”
499429	499436	499413	499413	I	884	“ She left me , Mirabelle . ”
499437	499441	499442	499442	She	1120	“ No way . ”
499446	499451	499442	499442	She	1120	“ You ’re serious . ”
499459	499474	499453	499453	I	884	“ I told her everything she wanted to know , and she left me . ”
499520	499537	499490	499490	My	884	“ I ’m sure you ’re overreacting . People fight . You ’ll get past this . ”
499570	499578	499566	499566	I	884	“ Anything ’s possible , I suppose . ”
499579	499588	499589	499589	She	1120	“ But you do n’t really believe that . ”
499601	499614	499589	499589	She	1120	“ Oh , Hudson , what happened ? Maybe I can help . ”
499777	499783	499774	499774	she	1120	“ Fuck you , Hudson . ”
499809	499818	499819	499819	Her	1120	“ I love you . I really do . ”
499826	499862	499819	499819	Her	1120	“ And I ’m always going to be here for you , but you really fucked up this time . And if you do n’t recognize that , then there ’s no hope for you . ”
499886	499893	499876	499876	Her	1120	“ I recognize it . Fully . ”
499901	499908	499894	499894	She	1120	“ That ’s something at least . ”
499909	499920	499894	499894	She	1120	“ It ’s the worst thing I ’ve ever done . ”
499921	499928	499894	499894	She	1120	“ I do n’t doubt it . ”
500018	500056	500009	500009	she	1120	“ Losing her , Mirabelle , it’s … it ’s hitting bottom . I ’m seeing Dr. Alberts again . I tried to change when you sent me before , but now — now I want it . ”
500079	500117	500059	500059	she	1120	“ I ’m glad to hear that , Hudson . I really am . I only want the best for you . And I sincerely believe you can be a different man if you want to be . ”
500118	500122	500123	500123	I	884	“ I do . ”
500229	500240	500219	500219	I	884	“ I fucked up , but I genuinely love her . ”
500241	500245	500246	500246	Her	1120	“ I know . ”
500252	500267	500246	500246	Her	1120	“ She ’s not the only reason you want to change , is she ? ”
500268	500271	500219	500219	I	884	“ Possibly . ”
500304	500335	500285	500285	Mirabelle	1120	“ Because I do n’t know that you can win her back . This is … it ’s bad , Hudson . There may be no moving on from this . ”
500341	500360	500336	500336	I	884	“ The queen of love - conquers - all has doubts ? Man , I ’m really fucked . ”
500361	500368	500369	500369	She	1120	“ I ’m just being honest . ”
500377	500388	500369	500369	She	1120	“ And I want you better with or without her . ”
500429	500458	500460	500460	she	1120	“ It wo n’t be a problem . I wo n’t ever stop loving Alayna . I need to be ready in case she ever changes her mind . ”
500465	500475	500476	500476	Mirabelle	1120	“ Hudson . I ’m so mad at you . ”
500548	500569	500532	500532	she	1120	“ And I ’m so heartbroken . For both of you . I love that girl too , you know . ”
500570	500574	500575	500575	I	884	“ I know . ”
500597	500599	500595	500595	I	884	“ usually ”
500634	500657	500630	500630	she	1120	“ Ah , shit ! My opening ! Laynie ’s supposed to be a model . She ’ll probably back out now . ”
500658	500673	500674	500674	I	884	“ If I ’m there , yes , I ’d bet she does cancel . ”
500699	500705	500692	500692	my	884	“ I wo n’t come . ”
500729	500752	500726	500726	she	1120	“ I know I should try to argue , but honestly ? I do n’t want to . Do n’t hate me . ”
500753	500784	500785	500785	I	884	“ I understand . She ’s your model . You need her . I know she wants to be there for you . So please , let me back out . ”
500835	500854	500861	500861	she	8844	“ Okay . I ’ll let you back out . You ’re banned from the premises on Saturday . ”
500869	500885	500861	500861	she	8844	“ I mean it though . You ca n’t change your mind and show up . ”
500886	500895	500897	500897	I	884	“ I wo n’t . Scout ’s honor . ”
500978	501051	500973	500973	I	884	“ I could never hate you , Mirabelle . I love you . I want you to be happy . I want you to be proud to be my sister . As proud as I am to be your brother . You ’ve often been the only support I ’ve had . The only one who ’s believed in me . I hate that you ’re looking at me now with disappointment . ”
501060	501111	501057	501057	she	6477	“ I ’m disappointed , Hudson . I am . But it does n’t mean I ’m not proud to be your sister . I love you , too . Do n’t give up on her . More importantly , do n’t give up on yourself . I never will . ”
501165	501183	501153	501153	My	884	“ Alayna might still back out of the opening , you know . Even without me there . ”
501184	501188	501189	501189	Her	6477	“ I know . ”
501208	501272	501206	501206	Mirabelle	1120	“ I ’m going to think optimistically . And I ’m going to be optimistic about the two of you too . I do n’t think I ’ll let her know that I know what happened . She could be really embarrassed about this . Maybe she ’ll feel more comfortable if she is n’t worried about what I think about it all . ”
501273	501278	501284	501284	she	6477	“ That ’s insightful . ”
501303	501314	501295	501295	She	6477	“ I ’ll support however you want to play it . ”
501323	501334	501315	501315	I	884	“ I ’ll support whatever you say , I mean . ”
501353	501378	501345	501345	she	6477	“ You ’re a good guy , Hudson . You did a really shitty thing , but you ’re still a really good guy . ”
501393	501412	501386	501386	She	6477	“ God , I have to get out of here . I ’m too hormonal for this crap . ”
501413	501418	501419	501419	I	884	“ You ’re fine . ”
501433	501443	501430	501430	I	884	“ But was there another reason you came by ? ”
501444	501465	501466	501466	She	6477	“ Oh yeah . There was . There is . I ’m telling you — hormone - brain is crazy . ”
501479	501508	501466	501466	She	6477	“ Anyway , I hate to bring this up after all that you ’re going through , but there ’s something important , and I need your help . ”
501530	501538	501520	501520	she	6477	“ Of course . What is it ? ”
501539	501549	501512	501512	she	6477	“ It ’s Mom . She ’s in trouble . ”
501556	501567	501551	501551	I	884	“ She ’s been in trouble for a long time . ”
501577	501594	501574	501574	Mirabelle	1120	“ And we have n’t been there for her . It ’s time that we are . ”
501595	501602	501606	501606	her	1120	“ Are you staging another intervention ? ”
501614	501620	501606	501606	her	1120	“ Ah , you are . ”
501621	501628	501574	501574	Mirabelle	1120	“ You think it ’s stupid ? ”
501730	501738	501739	501739	I	884	“ It ’s not at all stupid , ”
501742	501747	501739	501739	I	884	“ It ’s beautiful . ”
501754	501761	501739	501739	I	884	“ Really , you think so ? ”
501762	501765	501739	501739	I	884	“ I do .
501766	501776	501739	501739	I	884	“ Thank you . That ’s really a relief . ”
501807	501867	501800	501800	I	884	“ I do n’t know how you ended up surrounded by such broken and battered souls . We do n’t deserve you . But I honestly believe none of us would have made it as far as we have if it had n’t been for you holding us together . You ’re our glue . You ’re my glue . ”
501887	501922	501880	501880	Mirabelle	1120	“ That was awfully poetic , Hudson . I ’d say I did n’t know you had it in you , but that would be a lie . There ’s hope for you yet . ”
502479	502485	502476	502476	she	9246	“ How did you … ? ”
502486	502490	502491	502491	I	884	“ Very sneakily . ”
502545	502588	502589	502589	She	9246	“ I ’ll admit , it was n’t easy . I had to convince another company to purchase a portion of the stock , and then I bought out that company — you do n’t really want the details , do you ? ”
502601	502625	502589	502589	She	9246	“ The contracts are signed now . That ’s all that matters . I ’m officially the majority owner of Werner Media Corporation . ”
502640	502651	502631	502631	she	9246	“ And you said you ’d quit playing the game . ”
502652	502661	502662	502662	I	884	“ I had one final move to make . ”
502838	502847	502825	502825	She	9246	“ It ’s checkmate , is it then ? ”
502848	502853	502859	502859	she	9246	“ You tell me . ”
502883	502892	502859	502859	she	9246	“ What are your plans for Werner Media ? ”
502899	502947	502948	502948	I	884	“ At the moment , I have no plans . The company ’s doing well as it is . Warren Werner is definitely the right man to be in charge . However , if there were any reason that I felt his presence was no longer needed … ”
502959	502965	502966	502966	Her	9246	“ He ’d be devastated . ”
503101	503146	503151	503151	she	9246	“ I imagine he ’d be devastated just to learn he no longer holds controlling interest . For now , the fact is still hidden . He has no idea that he ’s no longer in charge . Would you like that to change ? ”
503147	503150	503151	503151	she	9246	“ No , ”
503154	503172	503151	503151	she	9246	“ Do you plan on doing anything that might cause me to alter my current business plan ? ”
503177	503180	503173	503173	Her	9246	“ No . ”
503181	503189	503151	503151	she	9246	“ Then yes , it ’s checkmate . ”
503339	503350	503336	503336	she	9246	“ I guess it ’s time for me to go . ”
503351	503361	503336	503336	she	9246	“ It is . I ’ll walk you out . ”
503865	503870	503871	503871	I	884	“ Hold the elevator , ”
503940	503947	503937	503937	she	442	“ Well , this is awkward . ”
503984	504002	503975	503975	I	884	“ Is it really ? I have n’t ever lost this big . I would n’t know . ”
504036	504042	504028	504028	Celia	9246	“ You ’re an asshole . ”
504043	504053	504061	504061	I	884	“ It ’s a fraction of what you deserve . ”
504108	504128	504097	504097	Celia	9246	“ You know , my father is going to retire someday . What will you have over me then ? ”
504134	504193	504129	504129	I	884	“ Please . Your father ’s going to work until he dies . I give him another twenty years , at least . If you ’re still holding on to a revenge plot at that time … well , I do n’t think you could call anything you do a win then . You are n’t that pathetic . ”
504234	504294	504223	504223	I	884	“ But if you need further reason to drop this game , let me give one to you . I tied your hands legally . I ’d prefer not to use other methods to stop you , but hear this — I’d kill for Alayna if it came down to it . Please do n’t test me on that . ”
504299	504327	504328	504328	She	9246	“ It was only a question . I did n’t mean anything by it . The game is over , and I ’m bored with you both . ”
504333	504356	504328	504328	She	9246	“ I certainly hypothesized incorrectly on this one , did n’t I ? I ’d never have pegged you for a hero . ”
504399	504411	504393	504393	she	9246	“ Who exactly was your subject on this experiment , Celia ? ”
504451	504454	504445	504445	I	884	“ Celia ? ”
504461	504464	504457	504457	she	9246	“ What ? ”
504485	504505	504465	504465	I	884	“ You were never really playing Alayna , were you ? It was me . You were playing me . ”
504875	504897	504864	504864	she	9246	“ Take care , Hudson . If you ever decide to rejoin the game , you know where to find me . ”
505172	505183	505166	505166	Mirabelle	1120	“ Be sober or do n’t be in my life . ”
505230	505324	505226	505226	Jack	10551	“ I know the man you married disappeared a long time ago with the woman you once were . If I ’m asking you to be her again , then it ’s only fair that I find him again as well . You ’ve always been the love of my life , Sophia , even though the life I created for you — for us — was a shitty one . But , hell , we ’re still young . There ’s no reason we ca n’t start a better life together now . ”
505580	505675	505574	505574	I	884	“ I no longer know what came first , Mother — your drinking or my emotional withdrawal . It ’s like trying to answer the age - old question of the chicken or the egg . While blame is not important , I do know that our behaviors are directly correlated . That I ’ve contributed to your addiction . That you ’ve contributed to mine . With that in mind , I think that if I get well and you get well too , then both of us will have a better shot . ”
505698	505768	505693	505693	I	884	“ We ’ve both been hiding our flaws behind these crutches . It ’s time we face them . I ’m back in therapy . I do n’t want to be that person anymore , and I vow that I ’m going to change . For myself . For Alayna . For you . Will you change too ? For all of us ? For me ? For you ? ”
505933	505956	505926	505927	my father	8755	“ I ’ve called for a ride for me and Chandler . Take the car , go to Mira ’s and fight . ”
506103	506111	506086	506086	I	884	“ She left . I ’m sorry . ”
506153	506168	506169	506169	She	1120	“ What the hell , Hudson ? You were n’t supposed to be here . ”
506185	506200	506177	506177	I	884	“ And you ’re supposed to be watching your blood pressure . Stop shoving . ”
506215	506245	506246	506246	She	1120	“ If my blood pressure ’s spiking , it ’s not because of the shoving . It ’s the man who ’s being shoved that ’s causing me anxiety . ”
506261	506281	506282	506282	I	884	“ There ’s no reason for me to be causing you anything . Everything ’s good . Sit down . ”
506295	506306	506282	506282	I	884	“ Do you need me to get you some water ? ”
506307	506310	506311	506311	she	1120	“ No , ”
506314	506325	506311	506311	she	1120	“ I ’m perfectly hydrated , thank you very much . ”
506370	506381	506367	506367	I	884	“ Do n’t you need to be with your guests ? ”
506382	506394	506395	506395	Her	1120	“ I ’m on a potty break . It ’s fine . ”
506418	506434	506413	506413	she	1120	“ And what do you mean everything ’s good ? Did you talk to Alayna ? ”
506443	506447	506435	506435	I	884	“ I did . ”
506448	506451	506452	506452	She	1120	“ And ? ”
506476	506481	506435	506435	I	884	“ And I proposed . ”
506482	506487	506452	506452	She	1120	“ Um … what ? ”
506488	506500	506435	506435	I	884	“ You ’d be proud of her . She said no . ”
506571	506576	506594	506594	she	1120	“ Which is understandable . ”
506642	506646	506629	506629	I	884	“ Is it ? ”
506654	506671	506647	506647	Mirabelle	1120	“ You broke her heart , Hudson . You do n’t fix that with a proposal . ”
506720	506744	506745	506745	They	6561	“ It ’s good , though . I ’m going to win her back . I ’m not giving up until I do . ”
506791	506802	506777	506777	Mirabelle	1120	“ When the hell did you turn into a romantic ? ”
506808	506827	506803	506803	I	884	“ I did n’t . I just remembered that I ’m a man who gets what he wants . ”
506847	506865	506866	506866	She	8844	“ Yeah , do n’t use that line with her . That ’s not romantic at all . ”
506901	506910	506896	506896	I	884	“ Why not ? It ’s worked before . ”
506911	506917	506918	506918	She	8844	“ Maybe to get laid . ”
506924	506935	506936	506936	She	8844	“ And now that I think about that … ew . ”
506939	506957	506936	506936	She	8844	“ Anyway , cocky and dominating is not what ’s going to win back trust and affection . ”
506958	506968	506969	506969	I	884	“ How the fuck do you earn back trust ? ”
507135	507138	507139	507139	Mirabelle	1120	“ Time , ”
507150	507178	507139	507139	Mirabelle	1120	“ Give her space . Let her know you ’re still fighting for her . But do n’t do anything that will get you a restraining order . ”
507232	507249	507221	507221	Mirabelle	1120	“ Do you have anything specific planned to show her you ’re still thinking about her ? ”
507311	507317	507318	507318	I	884	“ Someone once told me , ”
507321	507345	507318	507318	I	884	“ that the way to win a girl ’s heart is to do things that prove you ’ve noticed who she really is . ”
507390	507411	507386	507386	Mirabelle	1120	“ You ’re seriously going to develop your game plan based on something I told you as an inexperienced teenager ? ”
507419	507435	507412	507412	I	884	“ Not a game , but yes , my plan is based on your suggestion . ”
507451	507458	507459	507459	I	884	“ Do you have anything better ? ”
507468	507488	507436	507436	She	1120	“ No . The idea ’s great . Simple . Romantic . It ’s really the best you got . ”
507489	507497	507498	507498	She	1120	“ Then what was that look for ? ”
507504	507524	507498	507498	She	1120	“ You . Asking my opinion about your love life . I told you that you would one day . ”
507530	507544	507525	507525	Her	1120	“ Do n’t get cocky . It ’s not good for the baby . ”
507565	507583	507557	507557	She	1120	“ Stop it . You ’re making me laugh , and my bladder ca n’t take it . ”
507584	507591	507592	507592	I	884	“ Go take your potty break . ”
507634	507642	507631	507631	she	1120	“ Are you going to be okay ? ”
507646	507654	507643	507643	I	884	“ Yes . I think I am . ”
508824	508828	508863	508864	the artist	4610	“ all of me ”
508832	508836	508863	508864	the artist	4610	“ all of you ”
508874	508879	508871	508872	John Legend	519	“ All of Me . ”
509204	509230	509196	509196	she	8844	“ I ca n’t accept this . I ’m in charge here . I ca n’t leave for a week to go to a spa . ”
509236	509247	509231	509231	She	8844	“ Unless you ’d rather I was n’t working here . ”
509254	509261	509248	509248	I	884	“ Do n’t ever think that . ”
509274	509295	509298	509298	hers	8844	“ If you think you ca n’t work with me as your owner , I ’ll give you the club . ”
509319	509331	509313	509313	She	8844	“ I just want to keep my job , thank you . ”
509373	509384	509366	509366	I	884	“ It ’s yours as long as you want it . ”
509403	509425	509385	509385	I	884	“ And the certificate — keep it . You can use it any time you want . There ’s no expiration . ”
509447	509452	509441	509441	She	8844	“ Fine . Whatever . ”
509475	509481	509482	509482	She	8844	“ There ’s another thing . ”
509488	509499	509482	509482	She	8844	“ I need to get my stuff from the penthouse . ”
509559	509568	509554	509554	I	884	“ I wish you would n’t do that . ”
509574	509587	509569	509569	She	8844	“ I want to come get the rest of my things Monday . ”
509614	509630	509631	509631	My	884	“ I can have it packed and moved for you , if you ’d like . ”
509669	509677	509666	509666	she	8844	“ I ’d rather pack it myself . ”
509700	509709	509695	509695	I	884	“ At least let me arrange a truck . ”
509728	509736	509721	509721	she	8844	“ Okay . You can do that . ”
509737	509742	509743	509743	My	884	“ It ’s done . ”
509750	509764	509743	509743	My	884	“ This does n’t mean I ’m done trying to win you back . ”
509765	509777	509785	509785	her	8844	“ I did n’t think for a second that it did . ”
509834	509846	509827	509827	I	884	“ You say that as if you almost enjoy my groveling . ”
509873	509889	509864	509864	She	8844	“ I could n’t say , H. I have n’t really seen you grovel yet . ”
510898	510932	510886	510886	I	884	“ Also I need packers and a moving crew for this weekend . I can be here at nine on Saturday to supervise . Most everything needs to be out by Sunday night . ”
511359	511370	511371	511371	she	8844	“ Laynie ’s been listening to your damn song nonstop , ”
511375	511396	511371	511371	she	8844	“ And let me tell you , all of me thinks you ought to buy me a pair of earplugs . ”
512393	512403	512404	512404	she	10263	“ I did n’t expect you to be here , ”
512442	512452	512429	512429	she	10263	“ You did n’t say I could n’t be . ”
512462	512467	512468	512468	she	10263	“ It was implied , ”
512471	512483	512484	512484	My	884	“ You do n’t seem that horribly pissed to see me . ”
512569	512574	512564	512564	She	10263	“ Where is everything ? ”
512575	512583	512550	512550	she	10263	“ Your stuff is still all here . ”
512584	512591	512564	512564	She	10263	“ But where ’s your stuff ? ”
512624	512635	512620	512620	I	884	“ I ca n’t live here without you , Alayna . ”
512645	512652	512636	512636	She	10263	“ So you ’re moving out ? ”
512668	512678	512664	512664	me	884	“ Actually , I hope I ’m moving in . ”
512679	512693	512636	512636	She	10263	“ H , you confuse me enough without you trying to be confusing . ”
512700	512709	512636	512636	She	10263	“ Could you say something I can understand ? ”
512710	512715	512664	512664	me	884	“ I confuse you ? ”
512716	512722	512636	512636	She	10263	“ Is this a surprise ? ”
512742	512749	512750	512750	she	10263	“ So you ’re moving in ? ”
512788	512806	512783	512783	I	884	“ One day . I hope . But for now , I want you to live here . ”
512807	512810	512811	512811	Her	10263	“ What ? ”
512901	512974	512894	512894	I	884	“ I ca n’t live here without you , precious . But I do n’t want to sell it , because I love being here with you . Someday , you and I will be here again . While I ’m waiting for you — scratch that — while I ’m groveling for your forgiveness , it ’s a shame to let it sit empty . You and Liesl should move in . ”
512975	512983	512985	512985	she	10263	“ I ca n’t accept that , H. ”
512991	513008	513012	513012	she	10263	“ I had a feeling you ’d say that . Then it will have to sit . ”
513052	513059	513049	513049	she	10263	“ You could rent it out . ”
513060	513069	513049	513049	she	10263	“ I could rent it out to you . ”
513148	513165	513143	513143	She	10263	“ Seriously , though , where ’s all your stuff ? Did you get another place ? ”
513171	513181	513166	513166	I	884	“ I gave it all to a charity fundraiser . ”
513197	513205	513206	513206	she	10263	“ Lifestyles of the rich and famous , ”
513276	513306	513260	513260	I	884	“ I was n’t attached to any of it . This entire apartment was perfectly designed to my tastes and style , but it never felt like a home . ”
513315	513376	513307	513307	I	884	“ Not until you , Alayna . You made it come alive . The things that were here — they were chosen for me by someone I want completely removed from my life . Right now , the things here are the only things that made this house a place I ’d want to live . Your things . You . ”
513414	513435	513406	513406	she	10263	“ And when I move back in , we can refurnish this place from scratch . Together . You and I. ”
513444	513458	513436	513436	She	10263	“ You ’re so sure that one day I ’ll take you back . ”
513551	513556	513523	513523	She	10263	“ I ’m hopeful , ”
513564	513575	513523	513523	She	10263	“ Would you like to see how hopeful I am ? ”
513576	513579	513523	513523	She	10263	“ Sure . ”
513670	513675	513646	513646	I	884	“ I bought this . ”
513817	513823	513826	513826	her	10263	“ There ’s an inscription , ”
513856	513868	513850	513850	I	884	“ I realized something about the last time I asked this . ”
513881	513966	513850	513850	I	884	“ I did it wrong . First , I did n’t have a ring , and second , I should have gotten on one knee . But more importantly , I did n’t give you the right thing . I offered you everything I had , thinking that was the way to win your heart . That was n’t what you wanted at all . The only thing you ever asked for , the only thing I would never give you , was me . ”
513981	513987	513988	513988	I	884	“ But now I do . ”
513995	514041	513988	513988	I	884	“ Here I am , precious . I give myself freely . All of me , Alayna . No more walls or secrets or games or lies . I give you all of me , honestly . For forever , if you ’ll take it . ”
514194	514201	514187	514187	I	884	“ Alayna , I love you . ”
514248	514278	514236	514236	I	884	“ Will you marry me ? Not today , and not in Vegas , but in a church if you like , or at Mabel Shores in the Hamptons — ”
514279	514291	514338	514338	She	6667	“ Or the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens during the cherry blossom season ? ”
514292	514297	514298	514298	She	6667	“ Yes , there . ”
514313	514318	514309	514309	she	6667	“ Is that a — ”
514319	514322	514323	514323	She	6667	“ Yes . ”
514326	514332	514323	514323	She	6667	“ It ’s a yes . ”
514709	514715	514716	514716	she	8844	“ Old habits die hard , ”
514794	514801	514802	514802	she	8844	“ Alayna ’s already forgiven you , ”
514806	514846	514802	514802	she	8844	“ Use that knowledge to erase any fears you have . But there ’s no way for you — for both of you — to put this fully to rest without letting light into every corner of this darkness . ”
515461	515474	515475	515475	she	8844	“ It ’s not on the agenda for me to disclose anything , ”
515478	515486	515475	515475	she	8844	“ but I have my own confession . ”
515527	515616	515522	515522	She	8844	“ It could be easy to listen to what you ’ve said and focus on the heartache that you say you caused . But the part that ’s missing is that your experiments were done on grown - up people . Adults who are , in the end , responsible for themselves . You hurt Celia . She had a chance to walk away , and she did n’t . She ’s culpable for what she became after that . That ’s all her , H. Not you . ”
515625	515636	515617	515617	I	884	“ You had a chance to walk away , too . ”
515637	515653	515654	515654	Her	8844	“ I did . And me coming back to you — that ’s all me . ”
515661	515677	515654	515654	Her	8844	“ Though you did do a damn good job of making yourself impossible to resist . ”
515742	515772	515773	515773	She	8844	“ Here ’s my confession , H. It ’s a difficult one to admit because I do n’t want it to sound like I condone the things you did . ”
515779	515825	515773	515773	She	8844	“ But , honestly , I would n’t have given you the time of day if you had n’t manipulated me . No matter how you chased me . Nothing you could have done would have made me start any sort of relationship with you . ”
515886	515893	515894	515894	she	8844	“ Do n’t get me wrong , ”
515904	515981	515894	515894	she	8844	“ I was attracted to you at first sight . You pulled me to you inexplicably . I was instantly fixed on you . And that made you everything that I should stay away from . I ’d been well for a long time before you , Hudson . I ’m pretty sure I could have stayed on the wagon . It would have been difficult , but I would have avoided you like the plague . ”
516007	516055	516056	516056	She	8844	“ Then you waved money in front of me . And I convinced myself I needed that money enough to break my rules and do the thing you asked of me . If you had n’t done that , Hudson , if you had n’t played me … ”
516068	516112	516056	516056	She	8844	“ Honestly , I do n’t think there ’s any other way you could have won my attention . Unless you held a promotion over my head in exchange for spending time with you , and that would have been just as shitty . ”
516127	516249	516113	516113	She	8844	“ I would never have given myself the chance to fall in love with you if you had n’t forced me to . It does n’t excuse you . But it ’s the truth . And for that , I have to say that I guess things happened how they should have . If I had the chance to rewrite it all , I do n’t think I would change a thing . This is the path that led to me with you like this . It ’s the reason I came back to you so easily . Because I realized I ’d rather live through your betrayal and end up with you than never to have gotten you at all . ”
516358	516394	516354	516354	she	6689	“ Let me , Hudson . You told me things that were hard for you to say . Let me show you how much it does n’t matter . How much I love you anyway . ”
516550	516575	516538	516538	She	6689	“ I love you , Hudson Pierce . Every part of you . Every flaw , every scar . Just like you love me . ”
516587	516598	516576	516576	She	6689	“ I love the way you take care of me . ”
516606	516635	516599	516599	Her	6689	“ And the way you accept my jealousies and insecurities . I love your cock and the way you fuck me . And the way you make love . ”
516665	516685	516657	516657	she	6689	“ Did you say that I ca n’t come when I ’m in control ? Because I ’m coming . ”
517648	517657	517624	517624	I	884	“ All of me loves all of you . ”
517678	517682	517683	517683	Alayna	8844	“ Keep singing , ”
517698	517713	517692	517692	I	884	“ You were n’t supposed to hear that . And you should be sleeping . ”
517714	517731	517683	517683	Alayna	8844	“ But I ’m not sleeping . And I did hear that . So keep singing . ”
517749	517767	517770	517770	her	3576	“ Maybe later . Right now , since the easy part of all of this is over , ”
517773	517790	517768	517768	I	884	“ we should get to the hard work . It ’s time to pick a name . ”
517851	517859	517860	517860	she	1858	“ I need to see her first , ”
517864	517876	517860	517860	she	1858	“ I want her to have a name that fits her . ”
517900	517908	517891	517891	Alayna	8844	“ You think all this was easy ? ”
517925	517965	517909	517909	I	884	“ I meant for you . It was extremely hard for me to hear you call me those things that you did — especially near the end . But I was trying to not make a deal of it . ”
517966	517969	518014	518015	my wife	9246	“ Hudson ! ”
518096	518148	518081	518081	I	884	“ I ’m teasing and you know it , precious . I ’m grateful and proud of everything you went through to get our baby here . It ’s the best gift you could ever give me , and there are no words to express how amazed I am with you . ”
518247	518318	518241	518241	I	884	“ As much as I could go on with how much I adore you , Alayna , it ’s now almost seven . Our families are going to ascend on us soon , and I ’d love to have a name for her before they do . Though Baby Girl Pierce does have a certain ring to it , I ’m certain she ’d be made fun of at school . ”
518361	518395	518346	518346	Alayna	8844	“ Then look up the baby name site and let ’s get deciding . Otherwise your mother will take it upon herself to come up with a name and that ’s not happening . ”
518587	518595	518579	518579	Charlotte	528	“ I heard Celia Werner got engaged . ”
518603	518617	518596	518596	I	884	“ How do you always ruin the most beautiful moments with her name ? ”
518635	518650	518651	518651	She	9246	“ Shut up . I have n’t mentioned her since before we got married . ”
518814	518817	518818	518818	Alayna	8844	“ Anyway , ”
518822	518828	518818	518818	Alayna	8844	“ Your mother told me . ”
518829	518835	518836	518836	She	9246	“ Of course she did . ”
518929	518932	518933	518933	She	1858	“ Thoughts ? ”
518960	518968	518933	518933	She	1858	“ Regarding Celia ? Good for her . ”
519086	519093	519094	519094	Alayna	8844	“ Yeah , good for her . ”
519263	519266	519267	519267	I	884	“ Alayna , ”
519276	519285	519267	519267	I	884	“ did you know your name means precious ? ”
519291	519294	519286	519286	She	9246	“ Seriously ? ”
519295	519303	519304	519304	I	884	“ Precious ; sun ray . See ? ”
519323	519329	519317	519317	She	9246	“ Did you know that ? ”
519330	519336	519337	519337	I	884	“ I had no idea . ”
519374	519379	519380	519380	Alayna	8844	“ It was fated , ”
519387	519405	519380	519380	Alayna	8844	“ I was meant to be yours . You knew what I was about before I did . ”
519427	519436	519420	519420	I	884	“ You ’re giving me too much credit . ”
519437	519444	519451	519451	she	9246	“ No , I ’m not . ”
519530	519536	519539	519539	her	9246	“ She ’s waking up . ”
519553	519560	519561	519561	Alayna	8844	“ Hey , she ’s rooting , ”
519564	519578	519579	519579	I	884	“ It looks to me like she ’s trying to suck your breast . ”
519589	519604	519579	519579	I	884	“ I get it , little girl . I like sucking her breasts too . ”
519608	519617	519605	519605	Alayna	8844	“ That ’s called rooting , you dork . ”
519618	519629	519605	519605	Alayna	8844	“ It ’s not called rooting when I do it . ”
519630	519638	519639	519639	she	9246	“ No , that ’s called awesome , ”
519675	519694	519669	519669	I	884	“ Stop it . You ’re going to make me horny , and the nurse said six days . ”
519695	519699	519700	519700	I	884	“ Six weeks . ”
519703	519710	519700	519700	I	884	“ I suppose I heard wrong . ”
519711	519718	519669	519669	I	884	“ Yeah , that ’s it . ”
519737	519747	519719	519719	I	884	“ What do you think about the name Mina ? ”
519748	519754	519755	519755	She	9246	“ Mina ? Mina Louise . ”
519763	519773	519755	519755	She	9246	“ I like it . What does it mean ? ”
519774	519780	519781	519781	I	884	“ Precious . In Sanskrit . ”
519810	519824	519798	519798	her	9246	“ Look at her . What do you think ? Does it fit ? ”
519825	519831	519791	519791	her	9246	“ She ’s certainly precious . ”
519832	519837	519798	519798	her	9246	“ Like her mother . ”
520540	520543	520530	520530	I	884	“ normal , ”
520733	520738	520739	520739	Hudson	1556	" There you are , "
520771	520775	520755	520755	he	6772	" Rough night ? "
520781	520799	520776	520776	I	884	" One of them woke up at five . Took the bottle and was right back out . "
520878	520884	520864	520864	He	6772	" Which one was it ? ”
520885	520897	520899	520899	I	884	" Whichever one slept in the green and yellow frog pajamas . "
520990	520995	520996	520996	he	6772	" That was Brett , "
521015	521020	521004	521004	He	6772	" Should 've guessed . "
521036	521047	521030	521030	I	884	" Are you saying our little girl has an appetite ? "
521048	521066	521072	521072	he	6772	" I 'm saying our little girl will do anything to get more time with her mama . "
521086	521105	521072	521072	he	6772	" You should get back to bed . Get some more sleep before they wake up for good . "
521150	521158	521159	521159	I	884	" I 'll get there . Eventually . "
521200	521214	521186	521186	He	6772	" You 're still thinking about yesterday 's news , are n't you ? "
521310	521313	521314	521314	he	6772	" Alayna , "
521323	521331	521314	521314	he	6772	" You need to talk to me . "
521349	521372	521332	521332	I	884	" She 's going to be a member of our family , Hudson . Do n’t you see why I ’m concerned ? "
521373	521393	521394	521394	He	6772	" It 's not exactly close family . And , really , she 's been family all my life . "
521425	521472	521473	521473	I	884	" Your mother was best friends with her mother . That 's not the same as your brother marrying her step - daughter . Now there will be legal ties . There will be Thanksgivings with her , and Christmases and summer vacations and baby showers . "
521490	521506	521507	521507	Hudson	1556	" It 's not like she 's ever going to be alone with our children , "
521511	521542	521507	521507	Hudson	1556	" I think you will be surprised how infrequently we really do interact with her . She lives in England , after all . She ’ll go back there eventually . "
521569	521589	521543	521543	He	884	" You were the one who told me not to overreact when they started dating , as I recall . "
521668	521677	521678	521678	I	884	" It was supposed to be a fling ! ”
521686	521713	521678	521678	I	884	“ Chandler was supposed to lose interest when he realized this was n't a Montague - Capulet situation . This was n't supposed to be permanent ! "
521714	521721	521722	521722	Hudson	1556	“ And now things have changed . ”
521736	521752	521722	521722	Hudson	1556	" She 's different now . We do n't have anything to be concerned about . "
521785	521797	521798	521798	I	884	" But you do n't know that she 's different now , "
521803	521822	521798	521798	I	884	" You ’re just guessing . She did n’t do anything to show you that she ’s different . "
521823	521829	521830	521830	he	8788	" She fell in love , "
521836	521845	521830	521830	he	8788	“ That changes people . You know that . ”
521846	521857	521865	521865	me	884	" Or she 's playing like she fell in love . "
521902	521906	521893	521893	Hudson	1556	" Come here . "
521922	521925	521907	521907	I	884	" Why ? "
521926	521931	521893	521893	Hudson	1556	" Just do it . "
521981	521990	521991	521991	I	884	“ Hudson ! I ’m in my nightgown ! ”
522005	522013	521991	521991	I	884	“ It ’s covered with spit up . ”
522134	522169	522125	522125	I	884	“ You ’re trying to distract me . You think I ’m acting crazy . That I ’m obsessing over this whole Chandler and Genevieve getting married thing and worrying too much about Celia . ”
522170	522174	522223	522223	He	8788	“ Are you ? ”
522211	522222	522202	522202	I	884	“ I do n’t know . I ca n’t tell . ”
522236	522244	522223	522223	He	8788	“ I ’m not worried about it . ”
522380	522390	522373	522373	I	884	“ If you are n’t trying to distract me , ”
522398	522408	522391	522391	I	884	“ then why did you drag me in here ? ”
522409	522446	522447	522447	He	6778	“ Because I do think you need to give yourself a break . Stop being so hard on yourself . Make time for the things you enjoy — your books , your movies . Your husband . ”
522488	522495	522496	522496	I	884	“ It ’s been five days , ”
522511	522521	522522	522522	He	6778	“ That ’s even longer than I ’d thought . ”
522706	522711	522712	522712	he	6778	“ That ’s it , ”
522731	522736	522718	522718	I	884	“ I miss you . ”
522737	522744	522745	522745	he	6778	“ Tell me I ’m right , ”
522748	522761	522762	522762	He	6778	“ Tell me you want it . Tell me you deserve it . ”
522775	522791	522762	522762	He	6778	“ Tell me you are n’t going to forget about taking care of yourself again . ”
522792	522814	522762	522762	He	6778	“ You ’re right I want it I deserve it I ’ll take care of myself now hurry please Hudson please . ”
522941	522945	522946	522946	he	6778	“ I know , ”
522949	522959	522960	522960	He	6778	“ You feel good to me too , precious . ”
522973	522986	522960	522960	He	6778	“ I love it when you let me be good to you . ”
523007	523022	522999	522999	he	6778	“ Why is it we do n’t do this every day again , H ? ”
523037	523046	523073	523073	He	6778	“ I believe the reason is called children . ”
523047	523072	523073	523073	He	6778	“ Shh . Do n’t talk about them . I ’m about to come , and I do n’t want to make it weird . ”
523193	523207	523208	523208	I	884	“ It ’s been a while since you ’ve fucked me good morning , ”
523222	523226	523208	523208	I	884	“ Thank you . ”
523227	523255	523256	523256	He	6778	“ My pleasure . Though I ’m hoping it ’s not quite good morning for you . Do you think you ’ll be able to sleep now ? ”
523350	523371	523345	523345	I	884	“ Tell me again I ’m not crazy and that you ’d never let anything happen to any of us ? ”
523392	523458	523372	523372	He	6778	“ I ’m not going to tell you that you are n’t crazy , Alayna . But I love you no matter what you are , with all that I am . And there is no way in hell that I ’ll let Celia Fasbender , or anyone , for that matter , ever hurt you or our children . I swear on my life . ”
523459	523467	523512	523513	Pierce Industries	275	“ Okay . Then I can sleep . ”
523782	523792	523793	523793	Patricia	9246	" Your schedule is already up on your screen , "
523825	523838	523813	523813	She	9246	" Norma asked to be buzzed when you arrived . Shall I ? "
523881	523890	523876	523876	I	884	" Yes , buzz her . And coffee ? "
523891	523895	523896	523896	She	9246	" Already brewed . "
523964	523968	523969	523969	Patricia	9246	" Ms. Madison ? "
523979	523984	523989	523989	I	884	" Black , please . "
523985	523988	523969	523969	Patricia	9246	" Chandler ? "
524008	524017	524018	524018	He	700	" Cream and sugar , Trish . Thanks . "
524169	524175	524176	524176	I	884	“ Let ’s get started , ”
524186	524203	524176	524176	I	884	“ Multiple allegations of sexual harassment at one of our clubs . Let ’s discuss solutions . ”
524270	524275	524276	524276	Norma	10443	" He 's here ? "
524283	524292	524276	524276	Norma	10443	" You must be worried about potential backlash . "
524408	524432	524391	524391	she	9246	" I 'm not worried about backlash , per se , but I think the situation warrants a look at the security angle . "
524476	524482	524483	524483	Norma	10443	" If you say so , "
524522	524555	524556	524556	Taylor	534	" You can never be too prepared . Better security could have prevented a lot of this . I happen to think it 's a wise decision on your part , Hudson , "
524570	524576	524577	524577	Norma	10443	" Of course you do , "
524601	524670	524593	524593	She	10443	" I 've drawn up varying cost estimates based on each potential scenario . Option A is the least expensive , where we attempt to settle out of court with the accusers . You can read on all the way through to option F which includes all of that plus a complete overhaul and rebranding of the Adora nightclub . Obviously , this last is the most expensive . "
524679	524682	524671	524671	Chandler	676	" Yikes ! "
524697	524711	524683	524683	I	884	" As always , it costs the most to do the right thing . "
524742	524828	524730	524730	Taylor	534	" It might be the most expensive , Hudson , but , like you said , it is the right thing . In today 's social climate , you can not ignore accusations of sexual assault . Even if you pay these women lump sums and have them sign NDAs , they can come back to haunt you . At the very least , you should go with option C. Fire the current management and put out a statement saying that Pierce Industries believes women . "
524829	524852	524853	524853	Norma	10443	" You 'd lose a few weeks of income , or however long it would take to replace the nightclub ’s managers , "
524856	524893	524894	524894	She	10443	" It is the second best option , financially speaking , and because social statements can have long - term financial implications , it may actually be the most cost - effective in the long run . ”
524900	524913	524894	524894	She	10443	“ If I may ignore my position for a moment , Hudson — "
524914	524918	524919	524919	She	10443	" Go on . "
524931	525009	524894	524894	She	10443	" As of now , the scandal has only made local news . Do the right thing . Get the managers out . But even if you do n’t issue a statement , there is potential that people will talk and the truth will come out . You ’ll risk national headlines , and if you do n’t come out in front of it , it will seem like you ’re covering it up , which could — ”
525010	525015	525016	525016	Taylor	534	" I agree completely , ”
525033	525037	525016	525016	Taylor	534	“ And furthermore — "
525052	525086	525038	525038	Norma	10443	" — which could damage your financial bottom line irreparably . I think your best bet , though most expensive in the short run , would be to be transparent with your firings . ”
525087	525125	525126	525126	Taylor	534	" I agree , but there ’s also going to be immediate backlash if you try to continue business as usual , even if you ’ve fired the offending managers . There were too many people involved . ”
525137	525213	525126	525126	Taylor	534	" Do the statement , do the firings , but you should also shut down for a while . Say that you ’re doing a complete investigation , and you wo n’t open again until you ’re confident the entire problem has been washed clean . Then , do a complete overhaul of the building and the brand . Open again in a year as a higher end club when the whole thing is forgotten . "
525241	525276	525233	525233	she	10443	" If we close the place down and do a rebrand , that 's going to be jobs lost for everyone who works there , including the women who have come forward about harassment . "
525277	525288	525289	525289	Taylor	534	“ Severance packages for everyone but the three main managers , ”
525296	525305	525306	525306	Chandler	676	" Who are the managers being accused again ? "
525344	525355	525356	525356	I	884	" Steve Wolf , Jeffrey Bannon , and David Lindt , ”
525359	525369	525370	525370	Norma	10443	" David used to be at The Sky Launch , "
525373	525384	525370	525370	Norma	10443	" Did Alayna have any thoughts about this whole thing ? "
525385	525397	525398	525398	I	884	" I did n't want to bother her with the scandal , "
525580	525661	525687	525687	she	10443	" Fire the three accused . We 'll offer severance packages to everyone who is being laid off , and encourage them to re - apply down the road . It 's time to rebrand and put new life into that nightclub anyway . Sales have been sluggish under David 's management for some time . This is a good opportunity to regroup . Besides , it will take us a while to find a qualified person to take over . "
525662	525669	525670	525670	Taylor	534	" I 'll prepare a statement , "
525679	525682	525683	525683	Norma	10443	" Alrighty , "
525691	525729	525687	525687	she	10443	" Expensive , but I 'm sure it will pay off . Any leads on who you ’d like to hire for the position ? The sooner you start looking , the cheaper the transition will be . "
525730	525733	525734	525734	I	884	" Chandler , ”
525745	525779	525737	525737	I	884	“ I 'm putting you in charge of finding someone to take over and rebrand Adora . Start with figuring out a new vision for the place before you search for a manager . "
525846	525896	525840	525840	I	884	" Try contacting Satcher Rutherford . His family owns a chain of international nightclubs that are doing really well right now . He should have someone for you . He does n't like me very much , though , so you might want to leave me out of it . "
525897	525904	525905	525905	Chandler	676	" Do I want to know ? "
525970	525975	525964	525964	my	884	" You do n't . "
525983	526002	525976	525976	I	884	“ Thank you for meeting so early , everyone . You each have tasks . You ’re dismissed . ”
526040	526043	526044	526044	I	884	" Chandler , "
526067	526076	526057	526057	I	884	" What happened to waiting a few years ? "
526136	526142	526126	526126	He	676	" What happened to congratulations ? "
526143	526149	526124	526124	me	884	" I said that yesterday . "
526150	526193	526126	526126	He	676	" And I said we 'd wait last year . Times change , bro . We were ready to settle down sooner than we thought we would be . And no , she ’s not pregnant , so do n’t even ask . "
526257	526267	526268	526270	The British businessman	6854	" What does Genevieve 's father think about this ? "
526281	526296	526297	526297	He	6854	" He 's oddly supportive . He 's even throwing us an engagement party . "
526306	526324	526297	526297	He	6854	" Well , Celia is throwing us an engagement party . But it was Edward ’s idea . "
526341	526351	526353	526353	she	9246	" Is she , now ? How very thoughtful . "
526379	526382	526353	526353	she	9246	" Hudson ? "
526383	526386	526353	526353	she	9246	" Hmm ? "
526387	526412	526353	526353	she	9246	" If you do n't need me anymore , I really need to get on the Adora rebrand and tracking down this Satcher Waterford … "
526413	526416	526417	526417	I	884	" Rutherford , "
526420	526427	526417	526417	I	884	" You 're free to go . "
526483	526495	526520	526520	he	884	" Oh , and shut the door on your way out . "
526591	526599	526600	526600	Celia	9246	" Hudson , what an unexpected surprise . "
526623	526632	526600	526600	Celia	9246	" To what do I owe the pleasure ? "
526682	526695	526696	526696	I	884	" I hear you 're throwing an engagement party for the kids , "
526719	526734	526735	526735	She	9246	" Word gets around quick . We have n't even set a date yet . ”
526771	526796	526765	526765	I	884	“ Is n't the news fantastic ? I knew those two lovebirds were meant for each other the minute I heard they were dating . "
526832	526847	526848	526848	I	884	" I ca n't speak to the wisdom of my brother ’s romantic notions , "
526853	526894	526848	526848	I	884	" but he does seem sincere in his intent to marry Genevieve . Therefore , I ’m presuming this party of yours will be the first of many occasions that our families will have reason to attend an event together . "
526895	526901	526905	526905	I	884	" And this concerns you ? "
526923	526932	526933	526933	I	884	" Concerned is putting it a bit harshly . "
526960	526970	526952	526952	Alayna	8844	" I 'm more interested in everyone 's comfort . "
526971	527023	527024	527024	She	9246	" Ah , I see . I suppose it would n't do to have any catfights spoiling the mood . Not fair to the kids . I ’ll be sure to seat you and Laynie , as well as Jack and Sophia , far from me , if that reassures you . "
527054	527075	527050	527050	she	9246	" That does n't mean stuffing us in the back , either , Celia . We are Chandler 's family . "
527076	527117	527050	527050	she	9246	" Oh , Huds , what do you take me for ? I would never do that . I want the party to be fabulous . Something everyone talks about . I ’m not going to ruin anything on purpose . "
527133	527145	527050	527050	she	9246	" Then you 'll let me see the seating chart beforehand ? "
527146	527161	527162	527162	She	9246	" Definitely . Once we 've selected the date and picked out a venue . "
527260	527266	527267	527267	I	884	" I appreciate your cooperation , "
527275	527286	527287	527287	she	9246	" Any time . We ’re family now . Practically , ”
527296	527366	527287	527287	she	9246	" I have to say , I 'm surprised you ’re still in the States . I ’d have thought that you and Edward would 've returned to England by now . You said you wanted to raise your child there , and since the merger with Werner Media was denied and the three point alliance has been established between our businesses , there ’s nothing for you here . "
527438	527463	527464	527464	She	9246	" Is n't it great that we ’ve decided to stay , though ? Or we would n't be here for all the celebrating . "
527486	527500	527479	527479	I	884	" That was n't what I was hoping to elicit from my comment . "
527501	527525	527464	527464	She	9246	" You want to know when I 'm leaving . Well , I ’m not . Not without a bigger piece of Werner . "
527526	527531	527532	527532	I	884	" Oh , really , ”
527541	527555	527535	527535	She	9246	“ And why would I give you a bigger piece of Werner Media ? ”
527556	527570	527464	527464	She	9246	“ I never said that we were looking to get it from you . ”
527582	527585	527575	527575	I	884	“ Oh ? ”
527586	527608	527535	527535	She	9246	" Do n't act all casual about it , Huds . We both know this is a big deal between us . "
527725	527736	527737	527737	she	9246	" We ’re willing to buy from you , though , "
527745	527765	527737	527737	she	9246	" That 's not happening . Give control to you and your husband ? Why would I do that ? "
527780	527788	527789	527789	Celia	9246	" We ’re not asking for control , ”
527792	527854	527789	527789	Celia	9246	“ We ’re asking for equal shares bought at full price . Equal footing in our three - point alliance . We each come to this partnership with a company and stock in Werner , and those shares should be distributed fairly . It ’s the only way to move on , if we want this feud truly to be over . "
527884	527891	527892	527892	I	884	" I 'll think about it , "
527923	527934	527935	527935	she	9246	" Thank you , Huds . I appreciate your cooperation , "
527968	527979	527957	527957	I	884	" Any time . We ’re family now . Practically . ”
528017	528022	528007	528007	she	9246	" I 'm sorry . "
528112	528116	528117	528117	I	884	" No worries , "
528141	528144	528133	528133	her	9246	" Maya ? "
528154	528159	528145	528145	I	884	" Could you — ? "
528182	528189	528190	528190	She	551	" Oh my goodness . Coming . "
528195	528205	528190	528190	She	551	" Brett ’s just gone down for her nap . "
528206	528229	528230	528230	I	884	" And Holden is out too , if you want to put him down , and then come back for these two ? "
528242	528246	528247	528247	She	551	" Sure thing . "
528256	528261	528262	528262	Gwen	816	" I 'm sorry , "
528281	528333	528334	528334	She	551	" JC was going to watch all of them . Since we both have Mondays off , we do n't have the nanny , but then Jake got sick , so JC had to take him to the doctor , and here I am , schlepping kids over to your house . "
528343	528355	528334	528334	She	551	" Hey , look at that . Braden 's asleep too . "
528356	528367	528368	528368	Maya	551	" I 'll put the carrier in the nursery then , "
528381	528415	528368	528368	Maya	551	" Theo , you want to come help me put together some of Mina ’s puzzles ? She 's at day camp right now , but I 'm sure she wo n't mind . "
528443	528450	528451	528451	I	884	" We have so many babies , "
528454	528460	528451	528451	I	884	" How did this happen ? "
528461	528470	528471	528471	Gwen	816	" I keep asking myself the same thing , "
528477	528484	528471	528471	Gwen	816	" But they ’re so cute . "
528544	528553	528554	528554	I	884	" We could 've rescheduled , you know , "
528565	528571	528554	528554	I	884	" Today was n't urgent . "
528625	528651	528652	528652	She	816	" I know it 's not urgent , but I need your advice , and I did n’t want to talk about this by text . ”
528663	528682	528652	528652	She	816	" And I definitely did n’t want to talk about this by phone in case Hudson was around . "
528709	528726	528702	528702	I	884	“ Geez , way to pique my curiosity . Hit me . The doctor is in . ”
528727	528730	528731	528731	She	816	“ Okay . ”
528744	528747	528748	528748	she	816	“ Okay , ”
528772	528785	528786	528786	I	884	“ Oh , fuck , you ’re not pregnant , are you ? ”
528796	528809	528786	528786	I	884	“ No ! God , no . I ’m still breastfeeding Braden . ”
528822	528828	528829	528829	I	884	“ Then what is it ? ”
528838	528896	528812	528812	her	816	“ Remember how last year Mirabelle told us she ’d heard about these sex parties around town ? The anonymous , masquerade , private kink parties that required exclusive invites because most of the guests were elite upper class , important people ? Famous people ? People that do n’t want their kinks in the gossip columns ? ”
528897	528915	529000	529000	She	816	“ Yes , but you know half of what she hears from her clients is bullshit rumors . ”
528916	528921	528922	528922	She	816	“ Right , right . ”
528954	528975	528939	528945	a prominent figure at the White House	6880	“ But . This time , the rumor is n’t so much a rumor anymore . JC got an invite . ”
528976	528979	528939	528945	a prominent figure at the White House	6880	“ What . ”
528991	528999	529000	529000	She	816	“ Yep . Exactly what I said . ”
529024	529107	529000	529000	She	816	“ This guy who sometimes co - invests in projects with JC got us the invitation . Honestly , I think he has a thing for my husband — maybe for both of us ? And is probably hoping for a threesome , which JC said no way to already . Not that I asked ! He does n’t share , and neither do I , but you do n’t have to have sex if you go to one of these things . ”
529108	529120	529146	529146	she	816	“ You mean , you could just go and ... watch ? ”
529121	529132	529133	529133	Her	816	“ Yeah . Just watch . Like a live porno . ”
529179	529184	529185	529185	Her	816	“ That ’s hot . ”
529199	529208	529185	529185	Her	816	“ So hot . JC thinks so too . ”
529340	529347	529348	529348	I	884	“ Are you going to go ? ”
529362	529376	529357	529357	she	816	“ I do n’t know ! That ’s why I need your advice ! ”
529377	529384	529388	529388	Gwen	816	“ Let ’s talk it through . ”
529409	529418	529396	529396	I	884	“ Pros and cons . Pros — go . ”
529419	529440	529441	529441	She	816	“ It would be fun , an experience , spice up our love life — not that it needs it . ”
529463	529480	529454	529454	she	816	“ Could learn some new tricks . Make me feel young . Could meet new people . ”
529481	529491	529396	529396	I	884	“ Those are great . What are the cons ? ”
529492	529507	529454	529454	she	816	“ I hate people . Why would I want to meet more of them ? ”
529518	529538	529513	529513	Her	816	“ What if JC was attracted to another woman ? All those hot naked girls in front of him ? ”
529539	529560	529396	529396	I	884	“ He ’s always dealt with business around naked women , and he ’s only ever had eyes for you . ”
529561	529585	529513	529513	Her	816	“ I ’ve popped three babies out . I have a scar from my c - section . Two words : stretch marks . ”
529586	529599	529396	529396	I	884	“ Pfft . You know how devoted that man is to you . ”
529600	529606	529513	529513	Her	816	“ Yeah . I do . ”
529625	529637	529615	529615	I	884	“ Do you want to go to a kinky sex party ? ”
529668	529686	529651	529651	she	816	“ This is stupid , is n’t it ? I should n’t even be entertaining the idea . ”
529690	529696	529687	529687	I	884	“ Why the hell not ? ”
529697	529716	529651	529651	she	816	“ I ’m a respectable woman . I ’m a mother of three . I should be responsible . ”
529717	529728	529729	529729	I	884	“ That ’s right , you are a respectable woman . ”
529744	529882	529737	529737	I	884	“ And because you respect yourself , you should give yourself what you want . You should do something for yourself — and your husband . Something that is n’t at all about your identity as a mother . Is that really all you exist for now ? To feed and clothe and protect and shuttle around these little humans ? Yes , they ’re important , but if you start acting like the only part of yourself that you ’re obliged to is your motherly side , you ’re not going to be any good for them . You need to be a complete person , whole and entire , and , by damn , that means going to a sex party and watching other people kink it up if that ’s what fills your cup . ”
529895	529910	529883	529883	She	6892	“ Thank you . I knew that , but I needed to hear it . ”
529923	529941	529911	529911	I	884	“ And I need you to go to a party and tell me all the details after . ”
529942	529966	529967	529967	She	6892	“ I ’m still getting up the nerve , but , for sure , if I go , I ’ll tell you everything . ”
529971	529991	529967	529967	She	6892	“ Is that why this project is so important to you ? So you ’ll be whole and entire ? ”
530024	530041	530020	530022	a family woman	6893	“ Maybe ? It drives me . Good or bad , I ca n’t ignore it . ”
530042	530068	530020	530022	a family woman	6893	“ Well , I think it ’s good . And that ’s the other reason I needed to see you today — I have news . ”
530076	530080	530069	530069	My	884	" Tell me ! "
530081	530109	530020	530022	a family woman	6893	" Okay . So . I got definite confirmation that Lee Chong is looking to sell all three floors of the space adjacent to The Sky Launch . "
530137	530149	530150	530150	Gwen	816	" He does n't want to actually sell until January though , "
530156	530197	530150	530150	Gwen	816	" For tax reasons or whatever . But he ’s willing to do an under - the - table negotiation before that , and let work begin . Maybe do a rent - to - own kind of a thing . "
530217	530251	530212	530212	I	884	" Oh my God , oh my God ! He 's really willing to do this ? You think he ’d really sell to us ? We could really expand The Sky Launch ? "
530252	530263	530199	530199	she	816	" It sounds like it 's a pretty good possibility ! "
530264	530268	530269	530269	I	884	" Holy crapola . "
530294	530315	530281	530281	I	884	" Wait , how do you know this ? Did he tell you ? Have you spoken to him directly ? "
530321	530331	530316	530316	She	6895	" Liesl . Apparently she 's banging his kid . "
530332	530339	530340	530340	I	884	" Lee Chong has a son ? "
530379	530388	530389	530389	Gwen	816	" No , but he has a daughter , "
530393	530415	530418	530418	her	816	" Man , Leisl sure has a lot of fun . Did we have that much fun when we were single ? "
530442	530456	530457	530457	We	6901	" I could n't tell you . It was too long ago now . "
530470	530495	530467	530467	she	816	" So tell me what you 're thinking you want to do with the place . I 've been itching to see your plans . "
530496	530504	530505	530505	I	884	" I ’ve got them right here . "
530544	530581	530538	530538	I	884	" It 's obviously not very accurate , and it ’s just in the beginning stages , since we do n't have floor plans or specs or anything . But this is what I 'm thinking . "
530688	530715	530762	530762	She	816	" This is all incredible , Laynie . Hudson is going to go bananas for it . Why do n't you want to tell him yet ? "
530730	530761	530716	530716	I	884	" Because we both agreed I was n't going back to work until the twins were at least eighteen months old . And they 're not even a year yet . "
530771	530782	530762	530762	She	816	" So you changed your mind . He 'll understand . "
530783	530800	530762	530762	She	816	" Not if he does n't think I 'm well enough to go back to work . "
530817	530831	530832	530832	she	816	" You mean , because of what happened after the twins were born ? "
530836	530850	530832	530832	she	816	" You can say it , you know . Because I went crazy . "
530912	530967	530903	530903	Gwen	816	" No , I 'm not going to say you went crazy . You had a change of hormones that occurred from being pregnant and then not being pregnant . Which was exacerbated by having twins . A lot of women deal with postpartum depression and OCD . It does n't make you crazy . "
530977	530986	530968	530968	She	816	" Crazy thoughts . Not a crazy person . "
530987	530990	530991	530991	I	884	" Fine , "
530995	531024	530991	530991	I	884	" I was being melodramatic . But sometimes it brings levity to the situation . You sound like you 've done your homework . Researching up on it . "
531114	531120	531121	531121	she	816	" I wanted to understand , "
531126	531147	531121	531121	she	816	" And you are n't really sharing . You want to talk about it now ? What it was like ? "
531226	531242	531243	531243	I	884	" I guess it was like most of the other times when I got crazy — "
531247	531390	531243	531243	I	884	" When I obsessed over someone . Except this time I was fixated on the twins . I worried if they were eating enough . If they were clean enough . I washed their clothes so many times that some onesies fell apart after they 'd only worn them a couple of times . Their bottles never seemed clean enough , and I 'd buy new ones , and put them in the sterilizer , and then be convinced that the sterilizer was n't working , and then I 'd order a new sterilizer . I do n't even know how many sterilizers we bought . Poor Maya , I yelled at her to scrub everything ‘ better . ’ Disinfect everything ‘ better . ’ Do everything ‘ better . ’ I ’m lucky she still wants to work for me . "
531503	531514	531515	531515	Gwen	816	" Every mother has a certain amount of those feelings , "
531570	531612	531524	531524	she	816	" Right . They do . It 's natural , to an extent . But normally , our brains will have the thought , decide it 's an incorrect thought , and dispose of it . My brain got stuck there . "
531620	531683	531524	531524	she	816	" The breaking point was when I showed up at Hudson 's office with both twins strapped to me , my hair a mess , no makeup . No bra . Leaking milk through my T - shirt . Hysterical because I was suddenly convinced that the penthouse was n't safe enough . And we needed to move . Right . Then . "
531763	531795	531796	531796	I	884	" So now , I have medication and therapy , and a second nanny , and it ’s like none of that ever happened . I 'm much , much better . "
531823	531852	531853	531853	She	6919	" You look better , too . And you 're obviously thinking pretty clearly to be able to come up with this amazing plan for The Sky Launch . "
531864	531886	531853	531853	She	6919	" Maybe working has been good for you . Maybe the time off was more of a detriment than a help . "
531887	531907	531908	531908	We	6920	" I agree . With all the help around here , I 've been bored out of my mind . "
531958	531989	531990	531990	I	884	" Then Hudson is going to totally understand , Laynie . You just need to tell him . Tell him what you 're thinking . Come back to work officially . "
532075	532083	532084	532084	Gwen	816	" What are you not telling me ? "
532092	532121	532122	532122	I	884	" I do feel better , but there are some things I 'm still obsessing over . I guess that 's the right term for it . Like … ”
532132	532144	532122	532122	I	884	“ Did you hear about Chandler and Genevieve ? Their engagement ? "
532145	532167	532168	532168	She	816	" He proposed ? He said when they moved in together that he was going to wait at least a year ! "
532173	532184	532168	532168	She	816	" That boy has it hard , does n't he ? "
532234	532276	532277	532277	God	8844	" I do think they ’re really in love . I 'm not doubting that . Just , a marriage means that now we 're going to be tied to Genevieve 's family . And Genevieve 's father is married to … "
532289	532294	532295	532295	Her	816	" Oh . Right . "
532304	532316	532295	532295	Her	816	" And you 're worrying about Celia interfering with your life ? "
532317	532351	532352	532352	My	884	" It seems ridiculous , I know . She has a baby now . I 'm sure she 's preoccupied with motherhood . And her husband . And probably never thinks about us . "
532367	532411	532352	532352	My	884	" But what if I 'm wrong ? I have more children than her , and I manage to find plenty of time to brood . What if she is still obsessed with us ? What if we 're not safe from her ? "
532415	532433	532412	532412	She	6928	" But that does n't sound necessarily like crazy thinking . That 's more just ... history . "
532568	532576	532563	532563	I	884	" Jordan , hang on a moment . "
532592	532620	532563	532563	I	884	" Once you 're back here with Mirabelle , text me . Alayna and I will be waiting in the lobby . We ’re already running late . "
532643	532653	532637	532637	I	884	" Why have n't I heard from you sooner ? "
532654	532668	532669	532669	Jordan	655	" Because you are n't going to like what I have to say , "
532676	532681	532682	532682	My	884	" You found something ? "
532689	532701	532682	532682	My	884	" No , just the opposite . I have gone through — "
532702	532706	532707	532708	the doorman	8793	" Mr. Pierce , "
532718	532725	532726	532726	I	884	" Hold on again , Jordan . "
532748	532751	532741	532741	I	884	" Yes ? "
532752	532760	532726	532726	I	884	" Someone left this for you earlier . "
532804	532817	532818	532818	I	884	" So you 've narrowed down the names I 've given you , "
532822	532869	532818	532818	I	884	" And I ca n't find anything suspicious from any of them . It 's going to take some closer investigating than I can do from a distance . I 'm going to need to talk to them personally to get a read on their reactions . "
532911	532929	532905	532905	I	884	" Do you have a plan of action ? One that does n't involve opening old wounds ? "
532944	532988	532905	532905	I	884	" I have an idea . It probably will open old wounds , but it will be safe . I 'll tell you more about it on Monday . Enjoy your night at the party . Try to relax this weekend , okay ? "
532989	532996	533006	533006	I	884	" Relax ? What 's that ? "
533010	533017	533018	533018	He	655	" How did Atlantic City go ? "
533037	533050	532905	532905	I	884	" Everything 's good . I do n't foresee any problems there . "
533051	533054	533055	533055	Mina	1858	" Daddy ! "
533079	533098	533055	533055	Mina	1858	" I mean it , Pierce . Take your weekend off from this . I 've got it . "
533195	533217	533188	533190	my little girl	6943	" Why , who is this lovely thing ? I do n't believe I 've ever met anyone so breathtakingly beautiful . "
533218	533221	533222	533222	Mina	1858	" Daddy , "
533225	533234	533222	533222	Mina	1858	" It 's me . It 's Mina . "
533235	533268	533269	533269	I	884	" Could n't be . Mina 's four years old . A little girl . She does n't wear grown - up ball gowns . She 's not a stunningly beautiful woman , ”
533281	533301	533302	533302	she	6943	" I am too ! I 'm wearing a costume , Daddy ! It ’s still me ! And , "
533328	533343	533315	533315	her	6943	" you should n't tell a girl that she ’s beautiful all the time . "
533344	533349	533355	533355	me	884	" I should n't ? "
533377	533394	533315	533315	her	6943	" No . You should tell her she 's smart and funny and brave and enough . "
533407	533429	533395	533395	I	884	" You are right , smart , brave , funny , more - than - enough Mina . I stand corrected . "
533445	533459	533395	533395	I	884	" Is that what you 're going to wear on your date tonight ? "
533463	533469	533470	533470	she	6943	" Mommy said I could , "
533482	533510	533511	533511	She	6943	" Perfect choice . You ’ll wow everyone with your smart , funny , brave , enough choice in clothing . Now , go find some shoes . "
533689	533695	533679	533679	I	884	" Hi there , moonbeam . "
533724	533778	533696	533696	She	9246	" You know , you are so close to walking . I bet you could 've made a couple of steps if you ’d tried . All you had to do was let go of that walker . You might have fallen , but it ’s going to get easier . I promise . "
533820	533825	533826	533826	Peyton	565	" There she is , "
533847	533879	533840	533840	Holden	816	" I look away for five minutes to change this guy ’s diaper , and the other one disappears . I know I need to keep the door shut , but — "
533885	533923	533880	533880	I	884	" It gets stuffy in there , I know . I need to have someone come and look at the ventilation in the room . Remind me to do that , please . Are you feeling better ? "
533943	533962	533880	533880	I	884	" Much . Thanks for asking . If you ’ll hand her over , it 's dinner time . "
534054	534064	534046	534046	I	884	" You 're early . You ’re never early . ”
534068	534089	534090	534090	He	700	" I ’m never early for work . This is different , big bro . I ’m excited for this . ”
534117	534125	534112	534112	Chandler	676	" I hear congratulations are in order . ”
534150	534164	534144	534144	She	10263	" Thank you . It was unexpected , but I 'm truly excited . "
534199	534203	534204	534204	I	884	" No ring ? "
534212	534218	534219	534219	Genevieve	10263	" It 's being resized , "
534223	534230	534231	534231	She	10263	" I have pictures , though . "
534284	534296	534297	534297	she	10263	" There 's a few of them , if you scroll , "
534349	534354	534345	534345	my	884	" Chandler , really ? "
534374	534380	534345	534345	my	884	" Can you afford this ? "
534381	534385	534386	534386	he	700	" Har har , "
534418	534427	534402	534402	She	10263	" It 's perfect . I love it . "
534452	534457	534458	534458	I	884	" It 's beautiful , "
534631	534643	534620	534620	Genevieve	10263	" Oh , that 's my sister . And my stepmom . "
534659	534677	534644	534644	She	10263	" I guess there were n't as many pictures of the ring as I thought there were . "
534765	534776	534777	534777	I	884	" Where is it that you are taking Mina tonight ? "
534784	534790	534791	534791	Chandler	676	" Beauty and the Beast , "
534803	534820	534791	534791	Chandler	676	" We should be leaving soon if we ’re going to make dinner before the show . "
534821	534837	534838	534838	I	884	" Mina was just getting her shoes on , if you want to help her . "
534890	534897	534885	534885	I	884	" She 's in her bedroom . "
534910	534915	534916	534916	Genevieve	10263	" Where is Laynie ? "
534919	534935	534916	534916	Genevieve	10263	" I 'd like to show her the ring — or the pictures , anyway . "
534936	534945	534946	534946	I	884	" I was about to check on her . "
534956	534967	534946	534946	I	884	" I ’d make sure she only sees the ring . "
535033	535037	535028	535028	She	10263	" Of course . "
535076	535081	535082	535082	I	884	" You 're dressed , "
535085	535098	535066	535066	she	8844	" You sound disappointed . Do n't we need to get going ? "
535147	535158	535159	535159	I	884	" I was hoping I 'd have caught you sooner , "
535173	535179	535180	535180	I	884	" You look fucking fantastic , "
535186	535216	535180	535180	I	884	" and we have to share the car with Mirabelle so I ca n't do all the naughty things I wanted to do to you on the ride upstate . "
535229	535241	535242	535242	she	8844	" Save it for the ride back when we ’re alone , "
535272	535281	535282	535282	Mina	1858	" Uncle Chandler helped me find my shoes ! "
535313	535337	535305	535305	I	884	" Then he can help put them on , ca n’t he ? You do n’t want to be late for your musical . ”
535338	535350	535351	535351	She	9246	“ Uncle Chandler ! Come on ! The buckle ’s hard . ”
535362	535379	535305	535305	I	884	“ Alayna , Genevieve 's in there too . She wants to show you her ring . "
535380	535387	535388	535388	she	9246	" I have to see this , "
535624	535646	535623	535623	Alayna	8844	" Damn , he can fill out a suit . He 's still as hot as he was fifteen years ago . "
535743	535751	535738	535740	The second lady	6994	" Do you think he still — ? "
535782	535795	535763	535763	Mira	8319	" Are you planning anything big for the twin ’s birth — ? "
535796	535799	535800	535800	I	884	" Shh , "
535814	535819	535820	535820	I	884	" I 'm listening , "
535836	535863	535866	535868	the first woman	6994	" — walk around all night in just swimming trunks at those parties at Mabel Shores . Remember that ? Talk about shower nozzle masturbation material . ”
535918	535932	535905	535905	I	884	“ He was every woman ’s wet dream , that ’s for sure . "
535936	535943	535933	535933	Mira	8319	" Are they talking about Hudson ? "
535944	535954	535955	535955	Curiosity	207	" Yeah . I 'm pretty sure they are . ”
535962	535968	535955	535955	Curiosity	207	“ Do you know them ? "
535977	535990	535969	535969	She	8319	" Shit , I ca n't tell . They 're walking away . "
536009	536025	536026	536026	Mira	8319	“ What dicks . You should 've gotten up and told them what was what ! ”
536032	536050	536029	536029	I	884	" Nah . They can look all they want . It ’s flattering , in a way . "
536058	536097	536051	536051	She	8319	" It does n’t bother you at all ? They have to know he ’s married — everyone knows he ’s off the market — and they salivated over your man like he ’s a piece of meat . ”
536103	536131	536098	536098	I	884	“ I salivate over him too . I totally get it . But I 'm the one with the ring . So it does n’t bother me . ”
536260	536269	536270	536270	Gwen	816	" This party is kind of a drag , "
536285	536292	536293	536293	I	884	" It 's always a drag , "
536407	536417	536418	536418	she	816	" Well this year it 's draggier than usual , "
536444	536463	536431	536431	JC	687	" I 'm so glad to hear you say that . Does this mean we can leave now ? "
536464	536470	536471	536471	she	816	" We just got here , "
536474	536483	536471	536471	she	816	" We have to put our time in . "
536484	536506	536507	536507	JC	687	" Can we put our time in alone , in a secluded part of the garden ? Just you and me ? "
536524	536527	536528	536528	she	816	" No , "
536542	536561	536528	536528	she	816	" I 'm having me some girl time here . Go find Adam and have some guy time . "
536569	536582	536562	536562	She	816	" Oh , and get me another one of these . Please . "
536646	536657	536658	536658	I	884	" Do you guys think I had too many children ? "
536667	536676	536677	536677	Gwen	816	" You have as many as I do , "
536680	536694	536677	536677	Gwen	816	" and with fewer pregnancies . Better bargain , if you ask me . ”
536695	536703	536704	536704	Mira	8319	“ I do n’t know about that , ”
536710	536742	536704	536704	Mira	8319	“ You worked until the day you went into labor with all three . Bedrest is hell on earth . I would rather have ten pregnancies than another one with bedrest . ”
536761	536792	536748	536748	I	884	“ But do you think I had them too close together ? Not the twins , obviously . I mean the pregnancies . Should I have waited longer after Mina ? ”
536806	536831	536793	536793	Mira	8319	“ Are you stressing out , hon ? Do you need more help ? You need to tell us if you ’re feeling overloaded . ”
536929	536952	536922	536922	I	884	“ No . I have all that managed , as much as you can manage mommying . It ’s not like that . ”
536958	536966	536953	536953	Mira	8319	“ Then where is this coming from ? ”
536978	536987	536967	536967	I	884	“ Do you think Hudson ’s over me ? ”
536994	537014	536988	536988	Mira	8319	“ Oh my God , no ! Never . That man is the definition of only lives for you . ”
537015	537025	537026	537026	Gwen	816	“ He has mad love for you , Laynie , ”
537029	537034	537026	537026	Gwen	816	“ It ’s gross . ”
537077	537084	537085	537085	I	884	“ I know he loves me , ”
537088	537132	537085	537085	I	884	“ I really do . And I love him . Just ... can the magic really last forever ? Day in and day out . Does it get old after a while ? What if there ’s an expiration on happily ever after ? ”
537155	537166	537150	537150	Mira	8319	“ I knew it ! Those women did bother you . ”
537167	537171	537172	537172	Gwen	816	“ What women ? ”
537175	537185	537172	537172	Gwen	816	“ Scoot over . I want to sit now . ”
537186	537195	537196	537196	Mira	8319	“ These women who were ogling Hudson earlier , ”
537215	537227	537207	537207	Gwen	816	“ It was serious sexual harassment , if you ask me . ”
537228	537235	537236	537236	I	884	“ They did not bother me , ”
537239	537248	537249	537249	I	884	“ Okay maybe they did . A little . ”
537255	537285	537249	537249	I	884	“ But not because they were looking at him . It ’s just , what if he starts looking at them ? I would , if I were him . ”
537286	537292	537293	537293	Gwen	816	“ Shut the fuck up , ”
537296	537301	537293	537293	Gwen	816	“ You are hot . ”
537302	537317	537318	537318	Mira	8319	“ He would never look at anyone but you . I know my brother , ”
537321	537324	537325	537325	I	884	“ Mira , ”
537333	537349	537350	537350	I	884	“ You know that this is a size up from what I used to wear . ”
537375	537380	537381	537381	she	8319	“ You had twins ! ”
537384	537411	537364	537364	she	8319	“ Almost a year ago , and I still have n’t gotten my body back . And it ’s been five days since we had sex . ”
537412	537422	537423	537423	Mira	8319	“ Five days . Really ? Five whole days . ”
537445	537472	537364	537364	she	8319	“ I realize that ’s not long for some people , but it is for us . And it was five days before that , too . ”
537473	537479	537480	537480	Mira	8319	“ Because you have babies ! ”
537487	537558	537364	537364	she	8319	“ Who are n’t little anymore . They sleep through the night pretty well now . I have nannies who help me catch up on sleep during the day . And look — we’re out tonight , for the first time in weeks , and Hudson has spent the whole night on his phone . He did n’t even try to fool around in the car on the way up . ”
537559	537569	537570	537570	Mira	8319	“ Because I drove with you , you sillypants . ”
537579	537592	537595	537595	he	7023	“ He still used to try . No matter who was around . ”
537633	537642	537630	537630	I	884	“ JC still tried just now with Gwen . ”
537643	537649	537650	537650	Gwen	816	“ JC has no class , ”
537665	537678	537679	537679	Mira	8319	“ And Hudson was on his laptop the whole ride , Laynie , ”
537682	537781	537679	537679	Mira	8319	“ There ’s probably some work crisis he has n’t told you about , and he ’s dealing with that . You said he ’s been on the phone ? That proves it . I ’m driving home with Adam . You ’ll be alone with him then . Do n’t let him work anymore . Give him a little ... you know . I do n’t want to think about what the you know entails because he ’s my brother , but make it good , and you ’ll see it ’s all as it should be . ”
537802	537855	537795	537795	Gwen	816	“ Every woman has these worries now and then . This is n’t weird . It ’s part of the hormonal cycle , I swear . It pops up somewhere between needing to consume all the chocolate in the world and wanting to hump the first dick that walks in the room . ”
537863	537911	537856	537856	Mira	8319	“ Maybe that ’s just my cycle . Point is , it ’s natural to worry about our marriages . It ’s a good thing even . It makes us think about our relationships and not take them for granted . That ’s what keeps them alive . ”
537921	537936	537915	537915	I	884	“ You ’re right , you ’re right . I know you ’re right . ”
537937	537945	537946	537946	Gwen	816	“ Where is Hudson now , anyway ? ”
537949	537953	537954	537954	I	884	“ Over there . ”
538005	538012	538000	538000	Gwen	816	“ Who ’s that with him ? ”
538026	538036	538013	538013	I	884	“ One of the women who was ogling him . ”
538037	538042	538043	538043	Mira	8319	“ Oh , shit , ”
538046	538052	538043	538043	Mira	8319	“ I do know her . ”
538078	538083	538063	538063	she	1124	“ Who is it ? ”
538084	538087	538088	538088	Mira	8319	“ Well , ”
538091	538135	538088	538088	Mira	8319	“ You ’re not going to like this . She ’s Christina Brooke — or that was her maiden name . She ’s married . I ’m not sure what she goes by now . She used to be Celia ’s best friend . ”
538149	538152	538153	538153	I	884	“ Fabulous , ”
538158	538164	538165	538165	Gwen	816	“ This is probably fine , ”
538170	538209	538165	538165	Gwen	816	“ They ’re probably doing the obligatory catch - up . ‘ How have you been ? ’ ‘ How ’s the wife ? ’ ‘ How ’s your mother ? I hear she ’s sober now . ’ ”
538210	538217	538223	538223	Mingling	572	“ I should go over there . ”
538229	538241	538242	538242	Mira	8319	“ You do n’t need to make a scene , though , ”
538314	538329	538309	538309	Mira	8319	“ Okay . You might need to make a little bit of a scene . ”
538354	538363	538364	538364	he	6778	" Where 's she off to so fast ? "
538408	538417	538418	538418	Christina	442	" — know how I feel about fidelity ? "
538433	538441	538442	538442	Hudson	1556	" I thought I did , certainly , "
538445	538453	538454	538454	His	7033	" You might 've changed your mind . "
538507	538523	538500	538500	I	884	" Hi , I am Alayna Pierce . I do n't believe we 've met . "
538541	538576	538500	538500	I	884	" Alayna , this is Christina Rodham . We used to run in the same circles . We have n't seen each other for quite some time . Christina , this is my wife . "
538627	538635	538636	538636	She	9246	" Nice to meet you , Alayna . "
538649	538663	538636	538636	She	9246	" I should get back to Thaddeus . He 's here … somewhere . "
538690	538706	538682	538682	I	884	" It was really good to see you again , Hudson . Ta - ta . "
538762	538781	538756	538756	he	6778	" H , what did she mean when she said that you knew how she felt about fidelity ? "
538782	538790	538791	538791	he	6778	" She was talking about the past , "
538795	538821	538822	538822	He	6778	" Are you ready to go ? I 'm not in the mood to be here anymore , if that 's all right with you . "
538840	538847	538848	538848	I	884	" That 's fine . But . "
538852	538860	538848	538848	I	884	" Hudson . Who was that woman ? "
538873	538895	538861	538861	He	6778	" Christina Brooke . Rodham . I told you . I knew her when we were kids . Let ’s go . "
538902	538905	538861	538861	He	6778	" Hudson . "
538909	538918	538919	538919	I	884	" You fucked her . Did n't you ? "
538943	538961	538935	538935	His	6778	" A long time ago . Yes . When we were kids . Now can we go ? "
539264	539267	539260	539262	no more kids	7047	“ Hudson ? ”
539268	539271	539272	539272	He	6778	“ Hmm ? ”
539280	539289	539260	539262	no more kids	7047	“ I think you should have a vasectomy . ”
539290	539293	539294	539294	he	6778	“ No , ”
539370	539375	539376	539376	I	884	" Crisis at work ? "
539408	539411	539414	539414	he	6778	" Yes . "
539429	539438	539421	539421	I	884	" Who do you keep texting ? Norma ? "
539439	539444	539445	539445	His	6778	“ Right . Norma . ”
539452	539464	539445	539445	His	6778	" Who else would be working this late on a Friday ? ”
539473	539485	539465	539465	I	884	" Hand it over . I want to talk to her . "
539498	539501	539502	539502	He	6778	" No . ”
539514	539518	539508	539508	My	884	" Why not ? "
539544	539564	539539	539539	he	6778	" Because I 'm done playing with my phone . Now I ’m going to play with your pussy . "
539577	539580	539565	539565	Fury	574	" Really ? "
539581	539602	539603	539603	He	6778	" Really . You ’ve been neglected tonight . I have making up to do . Give me your foot . "
539657	539661	539662	539662	he	6778	" Good girl , "
539768	539788	539789	539789	he	6778	" I 've been wanting to get under your dress since the second you walked out of our bedroom , "
539792	539818	539789	539789	he	6778	" Sure could n't tell . All night , the only two things you had eyes for were that phone and Miss Christina Perfect Tits . "
539833	539844	539819	539819	He	6778	" She had perfect tits ? I had n't noticed . "
539845	539866	539870	539870	I	884	" How could you miss them ? If not now , then ten years ago . When you fucked her . "
539900	539918	539882	539882	He	6778	" I would n't know . I only fucked her once , and it was from behind . "
539919	539924	539925	539925	I	884	" Oh my God , "
539980	539988	539989	539989	I	884	" Why would you tell me that ? ”
539994	540003	539989	539989	I	884	“ I do n't want to hear that . "
540021	540026	540027	540027	he	6778	" You do n't ? "
540033	540047	540027	540027	he	6778	" That 's not like you . You usually want to know everything . "
540074	540084	540085	540085	I	884	" Okay , okay , I want to know , "
540105	540128	540092	540092	He	6778	" She might as well have been anyone . She was part of a game . Like every woman was before you . "
540142	540147	540129	540129	He	6778	" Are you better ? "
540148	540152	540153	540153	I	884	" Not yet . "
540177	540188	540174	540174	He	6778	" I 'm working on it , precious . Patience . "
540351	540370	540339	540339	he	6778	“ You ’ve made the big time . Hire a security team . Stop opening your own mail . "
540873	540886	540887	540887	he	655	" I do n't need to ask if you got any sleep , "
540894	540921	540887	540887	he	655	" If I had n't been up all night with you on the phone , I 'd be able to read it all over your face . "
540922	540928	540929	540929	I	884	" Hello to you too , "
540933	540942	540929	540929	I	884	“ Let 's take this to the library . "
540973	540992	540993	540993	She	8844	" Good morning , Jordan . It 's a little early for company . Should I be concerned ? "
541034	541041	541042	541042	I	884	" Of course not , precious , "
541048	541075	541042	541042	I	884	" Routine security updates . Weekends are the best time to get those things taken care of , and you know Jordan 's an early riser . "
541079	541094	541076	541076	She	8844	" I suppose this means that we 're doing breakfast without Daddy , kids . "
541180	541186	541187	541187	Mina	1858	" Can we have pancakes ? "
541197	541208	541187	541187	Mina	1858	“ Can I help make them ? I can stir ! ”
541209	541222	541223	541223	Alayna	8844	" Oh , yes , that wo n’t be messy at all . "
541236	541250	541229	541229	She	8844	" I am not getting you coffee , so do n’t even ask . "
541251	541257	541258	541258	I	884	" I already brewed some , "
541380	541388	541389	541389	he	655	“ The handwriting looks like the others , ”
541450	541457	541458	541458	he	655	" This is all there was ? "
541461	541478	541479	541479	I	884	" The photo was wrapped in a blank sheet of paper . I have that too . "
541547	541554	541555	541555	he	655	" Mind if I borrow this ? "
541559	541564	541555	541555	he	655	" By all means . "
541616	541643	541644	541644	he	655	" There wo n't be any fingerprints . There have n't been on any of them . But I 'll see what I can find out , "
541655	541669	541652	541652	I	884	“ The doorman said for sure that it had n’t been hand delivered ? ”
541733	541820	541821	541821	Jordan	655	“ It had been on the counter when Paul Gershwin , the one who gave it to you , arrived . I tracked down Stuart Patton , the doorman on shift before Gershwin , and he swears it came in a bigger envelope addressed to the building . It was enclosed with a menu for a new Ethiopian restaurant and an advertisement for a strip club . Patton threw everything away except the envelope addressed to you , which he left on the door stand counter . ”
541850	541853	541854	541854	I	884	“ Damn , ”
541857	541872	541854	541854	I	884	“ I really thought we had him . If it had been personally delivered ... ”
541873	541884	541885	541885	Jordan	655	“ The cameras in the lobby would have caught him , ”
541890	541894	541854	541854	I	884	“ Or her . ”
541895	541899	541900	541900	He	655	“ Or her . ”
541910	541938	541900	541900	He	655	“ This guy — this person — has proven to know you well enough to know you ’d never leave the lobby of your building without eyes . ”
541988	542005	541983	541983	I	884	" How is the surveillance team coming together ? Have you managed to fill every position ? ”
542006	542071	541965	541966	this asshole	7091	" Remember , you only asked for the increase last night . But I think I 've got all the shifts covered for the next couple of days . Long enough to recruit some boys from the old office . How do you want me to handle the team dedicated to your family ? Your wife is going to notice she ’s being followed . "
542072	542093	542094	542094	I	884	“ If they ’re good enough to have the job , they should be good enough not to be noticed , ”
542103	542114	542115	542115	I	884	“ Oh , do n’t look at me like that . ”
542139	542149	542115	542115	I	884	" I 'm going to tell her . Soon . "
542168	542209	542115	542115	I	884	" For now , tell them to do their best to hang back . She ’s a mother with three kids . She ’s usually preoccupied with them . She should n’t be too hard to watch from a distance . ”
542210	542214	542215	542215	he	655	" All right , "
542218	542248	542215	542215	he	655	“ As for the other thing we talked about last night , I ’m planning on spending the rest of today setting up as many interviews as I can . ”
542249	542256	542257	542257	I	884	“ Good . That ’s good . ”
542348	542375	542376	542376	Jordan	655	“ You know , you have enough cause to bring the FBI in now , if you decide that ’s the route you want to go . ”
542435	542443	542444	542444	I	884	“ No . It ’s too messy , ”
542449	542480	542444	542444	I	884	“ You ’re as competent as anyone on the FBI ’s team . More so . We ’ll keep this between us , if you think you can handle it . ”
542481	542487	542491	542491	he	655	“ I can handle it . ”
542566	542573	542574	542574	Jordan	655	" The next one is starting , "
542695	542704	542705	542705	Allison	578	" Thank you so much for coming in , "
542854	542858	542859	542859	Jordan	655	" Isaac Zucker , "
542865	542876	542859	542859	Jordan	655	" Do you remember what your engagement with him was ? "
542886	542905	542906	542906	I	884	" He 's probably going to be one of the ones you ’ll want to pay attention to , "
542909	542917	542918	542918	Allison	578	" As I said over the phone , "
542921	542954	542955	542955	She	578	" I 'm in the process of writing a tell - all book about Hudson Pierce . I want all the dirt , all the scandals . The worst of the worst . "
543345	543351	543352	543352	Jordan	655	" He 's definitely angry , "
543355	543385	543352	543352	Jordan	655	" I 'll see if I can get a better look at his timelines , perhaps I can match up anything to the dates the letters have been sent . "
543534	543543	543544	543544	he	655	“ I ’m crossing Jeffers off the list , ”
543601	543637	543593	543593	I	884	“ Marlene Jeffers spent ninety minutes explaining how I ruined her senior year of college by playing head games with her , and you ’re convinced she could n’t possibly be the person threatening me ? ”
543643	543717	543638	543638	He	655	“ It was in her body language . She had been angry , yes . Hurt , yes . But those are old wounds . She does n’t feel that now . She only showed up to the interview because she ’s hoping for a free plug of her Instagram lifestyle profile . Did n’t you notice how she dropped the name over and over ? I stopped counting at mention number nine . ”
543718	543721	543722	543722	He	655	“ Hmm . ”
543833	543840	543841	543841	I	884	“ Cross her off , then , ”
543988	543995	543980	543980	I	884	“ Let me see the list . ”
544049	544056	544057	544057	I	884	“ What do the highlights mean ? ”
544069	544091	544057	544057	I	884	“ The green are the people who have interviews scheduled . Yellow have n’t called back . Pink declined to meet . ”
544092	544123	544124	544124	I	884	“ There ’s a hell of a lot of pink . How is this going to work if we ca n’t get one of your people in front of them ? ”
544173	544223	544166	544166	Jordan	655	“ People who do n’t want to meet are less likely to be our guy . Our guy wants to talk . Our guy wants to shit all over you , and if he or she gets the opportunity , our guy is n’t going to pass it up . ”
544274	544278	544279	544279	I	884	“ Christina Brooke , ”
544289	544297	544279	544279	I	884	“ I saw her the other night . ”
544306	544309	544279	544279	I	884	“ And ? ”
544340	544373	544374	544374	I	884	“ Perhaps this is n’t the time to bring it up , but , seeing you , I feel I need to address the way I behaved with you in the past , ”
544378	544383	544374	544374	I	884	“ It was inappropriate . ”
544395	544441	544384	544384	She	7129	“ You mean the night we fucked each other ’s brains out , and Celia showed up ? What was inappropriate about that ? We had fun . You were n’t with Celia . If she got her feelings hurt , that was on her . ”
544442	544450	544451	544451	I	884	“ It may have appeared that way , ”
544460	544489	544451	544451	I	884	“ Yet I had indicated to her that there might be something more between her and I. I betrayed that when I went into a bedroom with you . ”
544525	544561	544518	544518	Christina	442	“ Not my business . I had a good time , like I said . Did you think I ’d care if you were unfaithful ? Do n’t you know how I feel about fidelity ? ”
544562	544570	544571	544571	I	884	" I thought I did , certainly , "
544575	544583	544571	544571	I	884	" You might 've changed your mind . "
544592	544599	544600	544600	I	884	“ She wants to fuck me , ”
544621	544633	544616	544616	she	442	“ I do n’t think she ’s ‘ our guy . ’ ”
544634	544661	544613	544613	Alayna	8844	“ Are you sure she does n’t want to fuck you enough to resent everyone else who has a piece of you that is n’t her ? ”
544788	544798	544799	544799	I	884	" Do you want to talk to Grandma today ? "
544816	544823	544824	544824	he	816	" Ba ba ba ba ba , "
544829	544841	544842	544842	I	884	" I believe the word you 're looking for is bitch , "
544855	544860	544861	544861	I	884	" Hello , Sophia , "
544872	544875	544876	544876	she	8844	" Good , "
544882	544905	544876	544876	she	8844	" You answered . I 've been trying to reach Hudson all morning , and he wo n't pick up his phone . "
544916	544931	544932	544932	She	8844	" It must be important then . What can I tell him for you ? "
544981	545034	544947	544947	she	8844	" It is important , thank you . I had lunch with Louise Gunther , and she knew it was n't her place to tell me this , but she felt it was her duty . She 's been a very good friend and proved it today by passing on this news . "
545051	545065	544947	544947	she	8844	" She plays tennis with Joni Sneed who plays bridge with Caroline Dunlow . "
545094	545121	545130	545130	Aryn	526	" Caroline is the director of the New Park Elementary School , as you know . All of the Pierce children and grandchildren have gone there . "
545144	545154	545155	545155	We	7138	" Yes , I know who Caroline Dunlow is . "
545176	545190	545191	545191	Her	1858	" Well . I ’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news . ”
545200	545226	545227	545227	Sophia	1858	“ But Louise says that Joni says that Caroline says you are n't getting in . I mean , that Mina is n't getting in , "
545231	545239	545227	545227	Sophia	1858	" Obviously , this is a tragedy . "
545249	545285	545240	545240	I	884	" I would n't quite call it a tragedy , but are you sure that the New Park School is denying Mina 's application ? We ’re perfect candidates , and Mina ’s a legacy . "
545323	545328	545329	545329	Sophia	1858	" I am certain , "
545339	545345	545329	545329	Sophia	1858	“ Louise was quite clear . ”
545346	545369	545329	545329	Sophia	1858	" That does n't make any sense . Mina did fabulous on her preliminary tests and interviews . Our references are spotless . "
545370	545400	545329	545329	Sophia	1858	" I 'm telling you what I heard . And , again , I 'm only the messenger here , but she did give me the reason as well . "
545444	545449	545434	545434	I	884	" Out with it . "
545450	545454	545428	545428	she	1858	" Unsatisfactory parentage . "
545495	545546	545547	545547	Sophia	1858	" Of course we should have expected this . I do n't know why we were n’t prepared beforehand . Should 've made an extra donation or contribution to their foundation in the Pierce name , perhaps a scholarship , but of course it ’s too late for that now ... "
545721	545753	545754	545754	Sophia	1858	" … about her in the future , Alayna . How is she going to get anywhere going forward if you ca n’t even get her into the family elementary school ? "
545765	545781	545754	545754	Sophia	1858	" I 'll take care of it . Thanks for letting me know . Goodbye . "
545792	545815	545788	545788	she	1858	" Wait , wait . What are you planning to do ? These people need finesse . They are the kind of — "
545816	545826	545827	545827	My	884	" I said I 'd take care of it . "
545991	546002	545985	545985	He	816	" Yeah , kid . I feel the same way . "
546195	546198	546199	546199	I	884	" Damnit , "
546236	546248	546219	546219	She	8212	" I 'm good enough for you , are n't I ? "
546284	546296	546281	546281	I	884	" How would you kids like to go on an outing ? "
546399	546412	546413	546413	he	710	" Do you need me to call your driver , Mrs. Pierce ? "
546435	546446	546447	546447	I	884	" No , thank you . We 're walking today . "
546488	546495	546496	546496	I	884	" Who are your new henchmen ? "
546526	546531	546513	546513	He	8793	" New security team . "
546532	546535	546538	546538	I	884	" Oh , "
546595	546603	546604	546604	he	8793	" Enjoy your day , Mrs. Pierce , "
546768	546785	546786	546786	I	884	" Good afternoon , Mrs. Pierce . Is there some way I can help you today ? "
546801	546815	546786	546786	I	884	" I need to speak to Ms. Dunlow , please . Right away . "
546816	546851	546786	546786	I	884	" I 'm sorry , but Ms. Dunlow is in a meeting with the board to finalize next year 's admissions . Can I take a message and have her get back to you ? "
546852	546868	546786	546786	I	884	" She 's meeting with the board now ? Deciding final admissions right this minute ? "
546909	546913	546903	546904	The secretary	210	”Yes , ma’am . ”
546914	546923	546903	546904	The secretary	210	" And they ’re meeting in this building ? "
546924	546927	546928	546928	she	7190	" Yes , "
546932	546942	546928	546928	she	7190	" they ’re in the conference center , but — "
546990	547004	547010	547010	her	7190	" Mrs. Pierce , Mrs. Pierce , you ca n't go back there ! "
547206	547210	547211	547211	she	7201	" Mrs. Pierce , ”
547216	547223	547224	547224	she	7201	“ Did we have an appointment ? "
547252	547265	547224	547224	she	7201	" Denise would be happy to reschedule with you at the front — "
547266	547341	547224	547224	she	7201	" No , we do not have an appointment . I would not like to make an appointment . I do n’t want to talk to you at a later time . I need to speak to you right now . Because from what I ’m hearing in the upper circles , if I do n't speak to you right now , I wo n’t have the opportunity to speak with you at all . "
547369	547396	547366	547366	her	587	" It seems that you 're upset , Mrs. Pierce . Alayna . Why do n't we take this into another room , and we can — "
547429	547455	547456	547456	I	884	" I do not want to take this into another room . What I have to say needs to be heard by all of you . ”
547467	547573	547456	547456	I	884	“ All of you . This enrollment system of yours is archaic and downright mean . How can you possibly determine my child 's ability to be educated simply by looking at the circumstances under which her mother was born and raised ? Obviously you are n’t taking into consideration all I have done to rise above my station , the lengths I have gone to in order to overcome my past , and the hurdles and the struggles that have faced me . I have an MBA . I graduated first in my class with a 4.0 grade average . I manage my own business .
547574	547629	547630	547630	I	884	“ But even if I had n’t done those things , even if I were ‘ just a housewife , ’ this determination is classist and pompous and really just terrible - ist . Especially , especially , letting other people know that I 'm an unsatisfactory parent before you even inform me … ? "
547648	547691	547639	547639	Brett	531	" It 's disgusting and intolerable , and I ca n't believe that we donated funds to this program or that we even wanted to enroll our daughter in the first place . Really . You should all be ashamed of yourselves ! ”
547703	547711	547712	547712	she	7204	" Caroline , I 'll handle this , "
547734	547744	547729	547729	I	884	" Who , may I ask , are you ? "
547842	547849	547850	547850	she	7204	" My name is Judith Cleary , ”
547853	547910	547850	547850	she	7204	“ Caroline is the director here , but I am the head of admissions . I am not sure how you came to the information that you were to be rejected , or who it was that leaked that the reasoning was unsatisfactory parentage , but I am afraid that your facts are not entirely complete . "
547928	547934	547920	547920	I	884	" What do you mean ? "
547948	547970	547920	547920	I	884	" It was n't because of you that Mina was given the unsatisfactory parentage enrollment denial , although given these circumstances ... "
547987	548002	547982	547982	she	1858	" That does n't make any sense . Why would Hudson be considered unsatisfactory ? "
548019	548034	548003	548004	Judith Cleary	215	" That , I 'm afraid , you 'll have to ask your husband . "
548103	548112	548113	548113	Trish	9246	" Would you like me to knock anyway ? "
548171	548184	548165	548165	Brett	531	“ No , that ’s okay . I ’ll see him tonight . ”
548244	548254	548255	548255	I	884	" Maya , I need to run an errand , "
548266	548277	548255	548255	I	884	" Would you mind taking the twins up with you ? "
548278	548286	548303	548305	the security guard	963	" Of course not , Mrs. Pierce . ”
548324	548332	548333	548333	I	884	" Now I 'd like my driver , "
548386	548397	548401	548401	one	1306	" Your driver is right now parking in the garage , "
548411	548431	548401	548401	one	1306	" Would you like to meet him down there , or have him pick you up at the curb ? "
548432	548439	548440	548440	I	884	" I 'll go down there . "
548576	548586	548587	548587	Trish	9246	" His phone is still on do not disturb , "
548598	548620	548587	548587	Trish	9246	" He 's pretty much had his doors closed all week . I 'm sure you can go right on in . "
549069	549083	549165	549166	Hudson Jordan	7091	“ ... should have counted on your past coming back to haunt you . ”
549084	549096	549165	549166	Hudson Jordan	7091	“ ... do n’t deserve your happy life , Hudson Pierce ... ”
549097	549107	549165	549166	Hudson Jordan	7091	“ The safety of your tower is an illusion . ”
549108	549117	549165	549166	Hudson Jordan	7091	“ ... you think you can protect her ? ”
549118	549124	549165	549166	Hudson Jordan	7091	“ Hold those children tight . ”
549125	549134	549165	549166	Hudson Jordan	7091	“ ... someone should take it all away . ”
549149	549163	549146	549146	I	884	“ Oh my God , Hudson ! What the hell is going on ? ”
549275	549277	549271	549272	the actor	7242	“ author ”
549282	549313	549271	549272	the actor	7242	" I 'm writing a tell - all that will expose Hudson Pierce for the man he is ... anything you have to contribute ... completely anonymous ... extremely helpful … ”
549425	549465	549402	549403	The man	676	" Hudson Pierce is a fraud . A pathetic excuse for a human . He deserves his bad karma and ill will for everything he ’s done to the innocent people who tried to know him and love him . "
549535	549550	549529	549530	the man	676	" A liar . A sociopath . A deceitful husband . An inattentive father . "
549618	549636	549637	549637	I	884	" Unrepentant . His attempts to make amends are shallow and laughable . He has n't changed . "
549652	549666	549637	549637	I	884	" He 's exactly the person he 's always been — a monster . "
549686	549697	549675	549675	I	884	" My God , Hudson . What 's going on ? "
549741	549748	549734	549734	I	884	" What are you doing here ? "
549749	549756	549757	549757	Her	9246	" No . I asked first . "
549778	549785	549766	549766	She	9246	" What the fuck are these ? "
549858	549871	549872	549872	I	884	" Give them to me . They ’re nothing to worry about , "
549916	549926	549927	549927	she	9246	" Like hell there ’s nothing to worry about , "
549961	549978	549947	549947	Her	9246	" I 've read them , Hudson . Every word , and every word was frightening . "
549998	550030	549981	549981	her	9246	" Alayna , I ’m sure you know we get threatening letters like this from time to time . It 's why we have a security team in the first place . ”
550036	550092	550093	550093	She	9246	" Yes , of course I know that . I 'm not naïve . But those are filled with ‘ Down with the one percent ’ and ‘ Die capitalist pig ’ sentiments . Those are generic hate letters written toward anyone with the money and good fortune to be included on a Forbes list . "
550105	550123	550093	550093	She	9246	" These talk about kissing your babies goodnight like it ’s an episode of My Favorite Murder . "
550189	550248	550249	550249	She	9246	" It 's true that most threats we get are banal and generic in tone , but that does n’t lend any more credibility to these than any others . I assure you Jordan is on top of this , as he is on top of all security risks , and there is nothing to be concerned about . "
550255	550265	550249	550249	She	9246	" You ’re telling me you are n’t concerned ? "
550266	550271	550272	550272	I	884	" I am not , "
550288	550305	550306	550306	She	9246	" Jesus Christ , it 's so bad you wo n't even tell me the truth . "
550326	550342	550306	550306	She	9246	" Do n't be ridiculous . Why would n't I be telling you the truth ? "
550464	550522	550423	550423	she	9246	" I do n't know why you ’re lying to me . That ’s the thing . Unless it 's so bad you ’re afraid to tell me . Are you afraid I 'd get upset ? Which really is n't fair , because of course I would get upset because this shithead is threatening my children ! "
550523	550549	550578	550578	she	7254	" With words , precious . Just with words . It 's some angry competitor trying to get under my skin , that 's all . "
550605	550610	550611	550611	I	884	" Like I said , ”
550616	550630	550611	550611	I	884	“ I 'm not concerned about it , and neither should you be . "
550631	550687	550611	550611	I	884	" And like I said , you ’re lying . I know you . If you were n't concerned about it , you would n't have it all spread out here in front of you . Jordan would be working on this alone . You would n't be looking at any of this at all . "
550727	550767	550721	550721	I	884	" That 's not necessarily true . Jordan was here earlier . He went over some of the details on this particular security threat and assured me it was being dealt with . It was standard protocol , Alayna . "
550768	550806	550807	550807	She	7254	" Yeah , right . You have n't been sleeping . Secret phone calls before dawn . Jordan came to our house on a Saturday morning . Do you really expect me to believe that was protocol ? ”
550821	550840	550807	550807	She	7254	“ How long has this been going on ? How long have you been keeping this from me ? ”
550841	550874	550807	550807	She	7254	" I 'm not keeping anything from you . There 's nothing to keep . It 's a few letters that reached an alert level , and we only received them recently . "
550875	550895	550896	550896	Her	7254	" One of them mentioned me being on bedrest , Hudson . The twins are almost a year old . ”
550907	550942	550896	550896	Her	7254	" That picture of me with the babies — you have someone following us , right ? Our guys took it ? It was n’t ... that was n’t someone else , was it ? "
550962	550967	550968	550968	I	884	" Listen to me , "
550978	550988	550968	550968	I	884	" You are safe . The babies are safe . "
550989	550997	550968	550968	I	884	" Then why is your eye twitching ? "
550998	551001	551002	551002	I	884	" Alayna … "
551192	551206	551184	551184	I	884	" You are overreacting . All of this is Pierce life as usual . "
551239	551253	551254	551254	She	9246	" Do you have suspects ? Is that what this is all for ? "
551288	551305	551306	551306	She	9246	" Do you have the person who ’s doing this ? You know who it is ? "
551374	551401	551402	551402	She	8844	" Alayna , I promise you that this is being taken care of , and you do n't need to worry about it . Go home . "
551410	551455	551402	551402	She	8844	" The fact it needs to be dealt with at all means I need to worry . The fact you ’re sleeping in the loft means I need to worry . The fact you are lying to me is as good as admitting it . ”
551456	551481	551482	551482	I	884	" I 'm not admitting anything . And I ’m not discussing this with you any longer . You are safe . Go home , "
551500	551518	551519	551519	She	8844	" I 'm safe , meaning you got the guy ? Meaning you know who it is ? "
551547	551588	551589	551589	I	884	" You 're safe , meaning I have extra security on you . On all of you . Jordan has bodyguards at the penthouse and at Mina ’s camp . They ’ll follow you everywhere you go from now on . "
551603	551626	551596	551596	She	8844	" Extra security ? Damnit . I knew that guy was following me today . Why did n’t you just tell me ? "
551627	551633	551596	551596	She	8844	" Because there 's nothing — "
551634	551647	551648	551648	she	8844	" If there 's nothing to tell , nothing to worry about , "
551652	551689	551648	551648	she	8844	" Then you would n't have to up our security team . Stop patronizing me , Hudson . I ’m not an idiot . And what about you ? Did you increase your security team too ? "
551715	551757	551702	551702	she	8844	" I upped your security as a matter of precaution . And to make you feel safe . My own security is exactly what it always has been because the risk is null and there is no reason to increase it . ”
551787	551812	551702	551702	she	8844	“ You mean you upped it to make you feel safe . You were n’t even going to tell me about any of this . ”
551845	551870	551840	551840	I	884	“ I am telling you there is nothing to worry about , and I mean it . I 'm handling it . Trust me . "
551883	551889	551871	551871	She	8844	" You expect me to — "
551906	551927	551890	551890	I	884	" I expect you to go home . And I do n't want you to fixate on this , either . "
551970	551993	551994	551994	She	8844	" You did n't tell me because you were worried about my mental health . That 's it , is n't it ? ”
552029	552037	551994	551994	She	8844	“ Well , fuck you , Hudson . "
552038	552050	552051	552051	I	884	" Alayna . Precious . That 's not what I meant . "
552062	552090	552091	552091	She	8844	" Oh , I know what you meant . Thank you . Thank you for validating all my fears of what my husband secretly thinks about me . "
552121	552139	552091	552091	She	8844	" If you 're stupid enough to come home tonight , plan to sleep on the couch . "
552140	552143	552144	552144	Her	8844	" Alayna … ”
552198	552201	552194	552194	she	8844	“ What ? ”
552291	552305	552306	552306	She	8844	" Once you get home , do n't go anywhere . All right ? "
552344	552349	552350	552350	I	884	" I love you , "
552355	552361	552362	552362	I	884	" Fuck you , Hudson , "
552455	552465	552466	552466	I	884	" Alayna knows about the extra security team now , "
552472	552480	552466	552466	I	884	" No need to continue hanging back . "
552490	552505	552481	552481	Jordan	7091	" Did you tell her ? Or did she find out on her own ? "
552522	552531	552506	552506	I	884	" Jesus , Jordan , does it matter ? "
552532	552569	552570	552570	He	7091	" I like to have a sense of how cooperative she 's going to be . Remember , I ’ve worked with her in the past . But I think I understand now . Good luck . "
552626	552640	552597	552597	I	884	" Anything pertinent I need to know before you leave for the day ? "
552641	552649	552650	552650	Patricia	9246	" It was relatively quiet , actually , "
552653	552677	552650	552650	Patricia	9246	" I hope you were able to get a lot of work done . Did Laynie slip out when I was n't looking ? "
552739	552754	552725	552725	I	884	" She needed some time alone , so she slipped out through the loft . "
552775	552799	552803	552803	her	9246	" That 's probably heaven for her right now . A couple of hours napping in a bed with no kids within earshot . "
552817	552824	552825	552825	God	8844	" I 'm sure it is . "
552833	552840	552825	552825	God	8844	" If there 's nothing else — "
552841	552893	552825	552825	God	8844	" Oh , Lee Chong needs to talk to you urgently . He said call any time tonight . He left you a message with the details on your voicemail . I told him I ’d be sure you listened to it and got back to him as soon as possible . "
552944	552953	552929	552929	I	884	" I 'll be sure and do that . "
553083	553089	553090	553090	I	884	" Do n't . Please , "
553259	553270	553271	553271	he	7091	" So we 're still doing this , are we ? "
553274	553306	553319	553319	his	7091	" It 's not me who 's doing anything , Hudson . It 's you who has all the secrets locked up inside and does n't want to share the key . "
553307	553310	553311	553311	he	7091	" Right , "
553392	553408	553409	553409	I	884	" I see that you did n't sleep on the couch like I specifically asked . ”
553422	553444	553409	553409	I	884	" I saw no point in sleeping on the couch when there was a perfectly good bed in the guest room . "
553445	553455	553456	553456	I	884	" The point was that you would be miserable . ”
553473	553482	553483	553483	he	7091	" Believe me — I was still miserable , "
553557	553585	553586	553586	I	884	" Well , until I feel less miserable , you can go right ahead and stay in there at night , as far as I 'm concerned , "
553650	553659	553660	553660	He	7091	" I guess I better start working harder . "
553683	553694	553660	553660	He	7091	" What do you have on your agenda for today ? "
553853	553856	553857	553857	he	7091	" Alayna ? "
553869	553872	553873	553873	I	884	" Things , "
553877	553882	553883	553883	He	7091	" My usual things . "
553972	553986	553987	553987	I	884	" You boosted security at The Sky Launch too , did n't you ? "
554001	554004	554005	554005	he	7091	" Yes , "
554009	554015	554016	554016	He	7091	" Why do you ask ? "
554030	554054	554016	554016	He	7091	" Because I do n't want anyone to get hurt or threatened there in some crazy douchebag 's attempt to get to me . "
554060	554064	554065	554065	He	7091	" How thoughtful . "
554071	554088	554065	554065	He	7091	" I 'd like you to stay put today , Alayna . Do you hear me ? "
554089	554099	554100	554100	I	884	" Jesus , you ’re kidding me , right ? "
554113	554142	554100	554100	I	884	" I ca n't stay locked in the penthouse like your princess in a tower . Even Mina goes to camp . I have things to do too . "
554143	554157	554168	554168	he	884	" Today you have things ? You have to leave the house today ? "
554187	554190	554191	554191	I	884	" Maybe . "
554220	554235	554236	554236	I	884	" All right , so there 's nothing today . But there could be . "
554248	554254	554255	554255	He	884	" Stay put , Alayna . "
554289	554306	554279	554279	he	884	" And if you do go anywhere , do n't give your bodyguards a hard time . "
554365	554386	554387	554387	Gwen	816	" So do you think it 's someone who knows Hudson ? Or some rando who ’s jealous and spiteful ? "
554697	554703	554704	554704	I	884	" I do n't know , "
554709	554737	554704	554704	I	884	" There were some pretty specific things in those letters . Things I did n’t even understand , but I do n’t think they were vague references . "
554738	554755	554804	554804	he	7091	" Someone Hudson used to work with , then ? An employee ? A business rival ? "
554756	554764	554704	554704	I	884	" Yeah , maybe something like that . "
554924	554929	554930	554930	she	816	" Are you worried ? "
554945	555004	555005	555005	I	884	" A little . Maybe more than a little . I would n't be worried if Hudson would give me the status and tell me exactly what was going on , but since he 's trying to dismiss it and say it 's no big deal , I ’m a little more convinced that ’s not the case . "
555008	555022	555005	555005	I	884	" Does he not even know you ? Of course you would worry . "
555071	555137	555064	555064	She	816	" I did n't think much about it when he said we were updating the security system here . It just happens sometimes , needing an upgrade , but this was a pretty expansive upgrade . That was more than a year ago now . Then , on Monday , we all of a sudden had a second set of security guards working the doors . "
555181	555189	555190	555190	Gwen	816	" I know what you 're thinking , "
555200	555290	555190	555190	Gwen	816	" But you 've had a lot going on . Being a mom and taking care of one kid is enough of a handful . You had a hard pregnancy and birthed twins . Your home life probably seems like it 's turned upside down . If there ’s been something going on this whole time , how the hell could you be expected to spot it ? Even if Hudson has acted differently , you ’d probably attribute it to not enough sleep and the new chaotic life . ”
555299	555311	555312	555312	I	884	" Or maybe it has n't been that serious until recently . "
555334	555353	555312	555312	I	884	" You did say the extra security started this week . And that 's true at home too . "
555354	555368	555369	555369	She	816	“ Good point . Maybe something changed . The threat got more real . ”
555375	555382	555369	555369	She	816	" Should you even be here ? "
555383	555393	555394	555394	I	884	" Oh my God , you sound like Hudson . ”
555406	555439	555394	555394	I	884	" He ’s gone out of his way to make it safe here . Obviously . And at least here I have something to do . At home , I have nothing — "
555440	555456	555457	555457	Gwen	816	" — except being the mother of two kids under one , and a preschooler , "
555460	555465	555466	555466	I	884	" I have nothing , "
555471	555538	555466	555466	I	884	" that challenges my mind , and I 'll end up obsessing over those letters until I drive myself crazy . Trust me . It 's better for everyone that I 'm out of the house . Besides , I did n't want to cancel on Lee Chong on such short notice . It ’s taken long enough already for these pieces to fall into place . "
555552	555565	555566	555566	she	816	" But your appointment with Lee Chong is n't until this afternoon , "
555569	555577	555566	555566	she	816	" Why are you here so early ? "
555578	555614	555615	555615	I	884	" I wanted to drop off my materials for the presentation before I ran my other errand . Which I should be getting to now if I want to get back in plenty of time . "
555683	555739	555672	555672	Gwen	816	" Errand ? You said you were safe because there was extra security here at The Sky Launch . Is it really smart for you to go anywhere else ? And why do I have a feeling that whatever this errand of yours is , it is n't going to make your husband very happy ? "
555740	555753	555754	555754	I	884	" Well , he 's not making me happy right now either , "
555787	555843	555758	555758	she	816	" Look . He ca n't expect me to sit back and let him do all the work on this by himself . Some of those threat letters referenced things in his past , things that I could n't make any sense of , but that does n't mean there is n't somebody who can . "
555851	555865	555844	555844	She	816	" Do n't tell me you 're going to Celia Werner about this . "
555866	555869	555844	555844	She	816	" No . "
555901	555915	555884	555884	I	884	" She is n't the only woman who knew Hudson before I did . "
555916	555934	555935	555935	She	816	" Okay . Good . Because for a minute there I thought you ’d truly gone crazy . "
555970	555986	555954	555954	I	884	" Hey , you do n't think she 's behind these threats , do you ? "
556015	556022	556023	556023	I	884	" She just had a baby , "
556037	556064	556023	556023	I	884	" She ca n't possibly be so obsessed with us that she 's been hounding Hudson for the last year and a half — could she ? "
556131	556163	556164	556164	I	884	" For the moment , I 'm giving her the benefit of the doubt . Because of the motherhood and marriage thing . But she ’s certainly on my possibility list , "
556167	556180	556181	556182	my friend	8280	" Hard to imagine that you might have enemies worse than her , "
556186	556192	556197	556197	my	884	" I know , right ? "
556254	556369	556246	556246	She	1120	" Laynie ! You do n’t have an appointment today . What are you doing here ? Of course I 'm so happy to see you . And you never have to have an appointment to come by . I will always fit you in . Do you need something to wear for an occasion ? Something special that I can help you with ? Is Hudson taking you somewhere special ? Or is this a social visit ? And who ’s the stocky bald guy brooding in the corner ? Did you finally hire a personal assistant ? Not the type I thought you ’d go for , but to each her own . ”
556570	556590	556544	556544	she	8319	" So what is it ? Need a dress or an escape ? I 'm happy to provide both . "
556642	556669	556670	556670	I	884	" Actually , I wanted to ask you something . I thought you might be able to help enlighten me about Hudson . About his past . "
556682	556701	556676	556676	her	8319	" That 's an odd request . I am intrigued . What exactly do you want to know ? "
556834	556841	556842	556842	she	8319	" Oh my God , Hudson ! "
556845	556926	556842	556842	she	8319	" I ca n't believe he was keeping you in the dark like this . Does n’t he understand anything about his wife ? Of course you 're going to obsess about it . Of course you would want to investigate on your own . Does he not know you ? Does he not think of you as a partner ? Marriage is supposed to be a two - way street ! This is absurd ! I ’d kill Adam . "
556927	556930	556937	556937	she	8319	" Exactly ! "
556979	557038	556963	556963	She	1120	" That brings me to why I came to you . I was hoping you would maybe be able to shed some light on the past . Maybe you could direct me to who might 've sent the letters ? He 's not helping me , since he 's not letting me know what angle he 's working . "
557063	557254	557055	557055	Mira	8319	" No way . Because what are you even thinking , Laynie ? Going off behind his back like this ? It 's one thing for him to keep something from you , but you 're just as bad . Is n't this the kind of thing that 's got you in trouble in the past ? Tip - toeing around him ? Two wrongs never make a right . And I am not about to get in the middle of your marriage squabble . You two need to work this out . You go back to him and you get him to open up to you . And thank you very much , for bringing whatever drama safety issue this is to my store . Did you even think about that ? You ’re a mother now . You have kids . Kids ! You ca n't go chasing down the bad guys like there are no consequences . Now promise me you are n’t going to follow up on anymore of this bullcrap and you ’ll leave the investigating to the people who do that for a living . ”
557255	557263	557264	557264	She	7313	“ Mira ! I ca n’t promise — ”
557269	557320	557264	557264	She	7313	“ Promise me , Laynie , or I ’m calling Hudson and telling him what you ’re up to . I am a mother , too , in case you forgot , and if you wo n’t be safe , keep us safe , I ’ll make sure it happens . ”
557457	557462	557463	557463	I	884	“ Okay . Fine , ”
557467	557471	557472	557472	she	7314	“ Thank you , ”
557541	557591	557592	557592	She	7314	" I ’m bringing something for you to try on , by the way , so that if I bump into my brother later and it comes up that I saw you , I wo n't be lying when I say you stopped by to get a new dress . "
557885	557890	557891	557891	Stacy	8674	" It 's exquisite , "
557904	557915	557916	557916	I	884	" You think so ? I like it , too . "
558108	558119	558120	558120	I	884	" Stacy , I 'd like to ask you something , "
558167	558221	558274	558274	She	8674	" I know I said I would never involve you in any drama again , but I would n't ask you if it was n't important . Do you know of anyone who might be … jealous … or maybe angry at Hudson ? Angry enough to … threaten him in any way ? "
558226	558273	558222	558222	Stacy	8674	" Are you kidding ? That 's about everybody in the New York City phone book . He 's richer than fuck . Of course people are jealous of him . And he 's a businessman . Of course people are mad at him , too . "
558288	558300	558274	558274	She	8674	" You want me to bring this up front for you ? "
558311	558316	558301	558301	I	884	" I 'm serious . "
558338	558350	558327	558327	I	884	" Stacy , are you still hung up on my husband ? "
558417	558423	558402	558402	She	8674	" Are you for real ? ”
558449	558460	558439	558439	I	884	" I 'm sorry , that was probably a stupid — "
558461	558544	558402	558402	She	8674	" You have some nerve , Alayna Withers Pierce . After everything you put me through before . Putting me in the middle of your soap opera drama . Dragging me into your personal shit , and what did I ever get out of it ? More accusations ? I 've never been anything but loyal to Mirabelle . Never done anything but admire the Pierces . You have some nerve . You can get someone else to ring up your dress . "
558555	558585	558545	558545	She	7336	" Oh , and tell your guy to stop hanging out around here . Three times this week I 've seen him . He 's making our clients nervous . "
558813	558819	558820	558820	Chandler	676	" Satcher Rutherford , man … ”
558823	558833	558820	558820	Chandler	676	“ You sure how to pick them , Hudson . "
558845	558895	558820	558820	Chandler	676	" I mean , he knows his shit , for sure . The Rutherfords own over sixty successful nightclubs around the world — New York , Atlanta , Las Vegas , Brazil , London , Tokyo — and Satcher is himself responsible for at least half of those clubs . "
558977	559120	558973	558973	he	676	" Thank God I did my research first , because the way you sent me out of that meeting a couple of weeks ago , I thought I was looking for a consultant to help us out with our reopening . Obviously Rutherford is way above consultation pay himself , and from what I 've discovered in my digging , he 's not into sharing information . I realized this needed to be an investment opportunity for him . So that was the proposal I put together — I did n't ask you about it because Trish says you 've been on do not disturb for the entire week and also ? Because fuck you , I 'm part of Pierce Industries , and I can make decisions myself . I do n't need you to sign off on all my shit . "
559161	559184	559185	559185	He	676	" The problem is that getting a meeting with the guy is harder than getting a meeting with the Queen of England . "
559228	559240	559224	559224	He	676	" Chandler , do n't exaggerate . Facts only , please . "
559241	559279	559224	559224	He	676	" That 's not an exaggeration . I probably could get a meeting with the Queen of England . Genevieve has a friend of a friend who knows a guy . Remember , she 's from Britain . "
559298	559337	559338	559338	I	884	" If you 're just here to tell us your hardships , with no question or real information , could you please do it at a later time ? We actually are in the middle of something here . "
559357	559368	559369	559369	He	676	" There is a point . I have a question . "
559380	559388	559369	559369	He	676	" Then do get on to it . "
559389	559411	559412	559412	He	676	" I 'm getting there . I 'm providing the background information first . Otherwise you wo n't understand the question . "
559429	559446	559447	559447	He	676	" So . Apparently , if you want to talk to Satcher there 's a process . "
559469	559595	559447	559447	He	676	" No matter who you are . Even the grand and mighty Pierce name could n't get around that . So I first had to talk to his guy , again . He 's younger than me , and get this — his name is Dudley . Dudley ! Can you imagine naming a child Dudley ? A baby Dudley ! I ca n’t even imagine calling a baby a grown - up name like that . What do you nickname him ? Dud ? It was seriously the only thing that went through my mind the whole time I was talking to him on the phone . It 's ridiculous . Having a guy named Dudley is ridiculous . Never name a baby Dudley . "
559596	559615	559616	559616	Jordan	7091	" You seem to be thinking about babies a lot here . Are you and your fiancée expecting ? "
559651	559702	559626	559626	his	7091	" No , once again , for everyone in the room — Genevieve is not pregnant . And we ’re not having any babies any time soon . We only think about them all the time because everyone around us has them as often as most people change their bedsheets . "
559739	559790	559626	559626	his	7091	" Anyway , Dudley , was very critical of our proposition . Did you know that Atlantic City is a dead zone right now ? Why do we even have a nightclub there ? Apparently nobody goes there for nightlife anymore . The whole city is , like , over . "
559800	559821	559791	559791	I	884	" Exactly why we need to have the very best behind our nightclub opening . To bring the population back . "
559822	559831	559832	559832	He	7091	" Right . Exactly . I know that . "
559841	559919	559832	559832	He	7091	" That 's totally what I was going to say to Satcher . When I saw him . Because even though I did n't convince Dudley Do - Right that our nightclub was a good idea , he did think that Satcher would want to hear about it , to — and I quote—'have a good laugh . ' So he advanced me to the next step , which was giving me a direct line to Satcher . "
559920	559931	559932	559932	I	884	" Good job . Sounds very productive and somewhat amusing . "
559943	559952	559832	559832	He	7091	" Wait . I am nowhere near done . "
559986	560080	559953	559953	I	884	" So I call Rutherford . I was expecting to talk to a secretary or something , but it was his actual direct line . When he answered , as soon as I introduced myself as a Pierce , the phone somehow goes dead . I give him the benefit of the doubt — maybe there was a lousy connection . I call him back . I go straight to voicemail . I called him back again . Straight to voicemail . I called him back four more times . Finally he answered . "
560096	560149	559953	559953	I	884	" This time he let me get past my last name and propose a meeting to discuss an investment opportunity . He said he did n’t want to have anything to do with Hudson Pierce or Pierce Industries . You were obviously not kidding when you said he did not like you . "
560173	560200	559953	559953	I	884	" But I told Satcher , no worries . I really do n’t like you either . You ’re a fucking asshole . Everyone knows that . "
560227	560236	560237	560237	he	7091	" Hey , it got me a meeting , "
560240	560251	560252	560252	I	884	" I suppose you do what you need to do . "
560262	560456	560237	560237	he	7091	" Or , I thought it got me a meeting . Because when I showed up at his New York office , his secretary seemed surprised . She said he must have made a mistake about his calendar , and he was n't even in the office that day . ‘ He must 've double booked . ’ I did n't buy it . He wanted to humiliate me and waste my time , and he succeeded . I looked like a goddamn idiot . This time , though , I was smart — I got the secretary ’s information . Shelley . Cute plump redhead . Little flirting with her got me her cell number as well as Satcher 's cell . Called him later that night , told him there must 've been a mixup , pretended to give him the benefit of the doubt . He apologized . Said he appreciated my tenacity — my tenacity ! How fucking patronizing . Like I was an intern instead of a peer in his field ! He appreciated it so much he set up dinner for the next night at Gaston ’s . "
560457	560461	560462	560462	I	884	" Good work , "
560470	560477	560478	560478	Chandler	676	" He stood me up again . "
560485	560512	560478	560478	Chandler	676	" I 'm telling you — this guy is Douche Juice with a capital D. It 's a wonder the two of you are n't friends . "
560518	560542	560513	560513	I	884	" In other words , you 've taken the very long route of telling me that you 've been unsuccessful in this endeavor . ”
560559	560621	560554	560554	Macallan	173	" Au contraire ! I made another phone call . This time to Shelley . Used all my charm and discovered that Mister Douche Juice is n't even in the country right now . But ! He 's opening up a new club in Austin and will be there in person tomorrow . I fly out first thing in the morning . "
560638	560653	560622	560622	I	884	" Good work ! Sounds like you really did n't need me at all . "
560659	560667	560668	560668	he	884	" Here ’s where I need you , ”
560677	560715	560668	560668	he	884	“ I need to know what the fuck you did to this guy to make him hate you so much and how the hell I ’m supposed to get him to want to work with us now . "
560748	560776	560816	560816	I	884	" Well , thank you , bro . But it 's only two - thirty . A little early for a drink , do n't you think ? "
560777	560794	560668	560668	he	884	" You asked me how I suggest you deal with him . This is my answer . "
560807	560815	560799	560799	he	884	“ And why does he hate you ? ”
560825	560836	560816	560816	I	884	“ We had a schoolboy rivalry . Simple as that . ”
560837	560869	560816	560816	I	884	“ No fucking way it ’s that simple . Not when he ’s going out of his way to mess with me because of my connection to you thirty years later . ”
560870	560881	560882	560882	I	884	“ Thirty years … It was half that long ago . ”
560899	560914	560816	560816	I	884	“ Twenty years ago , anyway . How old do you think I am ? ”
560915	560932	560961	560961	I	884	“ Do n’t worry about your age , Hudson . You look good for pushing forty . ”
560933	560939	560940	560940	I	884	“ I ’m not pushing … ”
560979	560987	560988	560988	Jordan	7091	“ Might this Rutherford be our guy ? ”
560994	560997	560998	560998	I	884	“ No , ”
561006	561018	561003	561003	I	884	“ Perhaps . If he ’s really still holding a grudge . ”
561019	561045	561046	561046	Chandler	676	“ What guy ? The guy for this job , because if he ’s not , tell me now before I fly to Texas tomorrow . ”
561049	561059	561046	561046	Chandler	676	“ And is he really still holding a grudge ? ”
561060	561080	561081	561081	I	884	“ Jordan ’s talking about something else . He ’s definitely still the guy for the Atlantic City job . ”
561089	561096	561097	561097	I	884	“ Unless he is our guy , ”
561102	561125	561097	561097	I	884	“ Which is very unlikely . I could n’t possibly have wounded his ego enough to push him to this extreme now . ”
561143	561205	561206	561206	He	676	“ Want to tell us what happened between you and Satcher and let us decide if he deserves to hate you today ? Let me rephrase — because I know you do n’t want to tell me anything ever , especially anything that has to do with you or your past , but maybe you could make an exception this once . ”
561311	561314	561315	561315	I	884	“ Fine , ”
561345	561351	561352	561352	he	676	“ What ’s all this ? ”
561381	561387	561352	561352	he	676	“ Binging Scandal on Netflix ? ”
561396	561401	561388	561388	Jordan	7091	“ Something like that . ”
561402	561409	561410	561410	I	884	“ Nothing at all like that , ”
561441	561445	561446	561446	I	884	“ Remote interviews . ”
561473	561478	561479	561479	I	884	" As I said , "
561492	561596	561479	561479	I	884	" we were kids when this took place . I ’ve known Satcher for as long as I can remember . Our families were very close friends . I 'm several months older than Satcher , but it worked out to being the same grade level . Before high school , we ’d usually only seen each other on the rare occasions where our parents would bring their children to socialize with them — birthday parties , summer events . We did n’t tend to ever enjoy each other ’s company , but it was never an issue until we were freshman together . "
561597	561604	561605	561605	Chandler	676	" Hold up , hold up , "
561617	561623	561608	561608	He	676	" Our parents had friends ? "
561663	561730	561660	561660	I	884	" Yes . A long time ago , they had a small group of friends . It consisted of the Werners , the Rutherfords , and two other couples . They were all very entwined in each other ’s lives , especially the Rutherfords and our parents . They were almost as wrapped up in each other as they were wrapped up in business and shopping . "
561731	561760	561761	561761	Chandler	676	" Why do you sound so sour about it ? It ’s kind of sweet , thinking about Mom and Dad hanging out with friends like regular people . "
561788	561825	561761	561761	Chandler	676	" There was nothing sweet about their entangled lives . It was scandal and dysfunction and alcoholism , each of them enabling each other in their addictions and encouraging one another to further ignore their children . "
561826	561829	561830	561830	he	676	" Oh , "
561840	561864	561830	561830	he	676	" Mom gave people attention other than you and you got jealous . Got it . Your life is suddenly becoming quite clear . ”
561873	561891	561865	561865	I	884	" If you want me to go on , you will keep your inaccurate commentary to yourself . "
561932	562059	561922	561922	I	884	" As I said , Satcher and I did n't have much to do with each other in our younger days . Not much that mattered , until we were freshman , and finally in the same school together , where it became obvious that he had an agenda to earn a certain notoriety among our peers . Apparently , he felt that said notoriety would be best achieved by engaging in a feud with me . I 'm still not sure why he chose me to be his rival — perhaps because I was the head of my class , an obvious choice , or because of our parents acquaintanceship — but our freshman and sophomore years were very tense , to put it lightly . "
562060	562086	562089	562089	Chandler	676	" Like what did he do ? Steal your girlfriend ? Instigate a fight after study hall ? Did he get you sent to detention ? "
562099	562112	562113	562113	I	884	" I have never served a day of detention in my life , "
562127	562236	562113	562113	I	884	" Our rivalry was much subtler than that . Yes , there were stolen love interests , both on my side and his , but that was nothing compared to the levels we eventually reached . Once he found out the subject of my final presentation for honors economics , he stole the idea and presented it before I did . I had to come up with a brand new idea and work frantically through the night to have mine ready the next day . Another time he convinced a student teacher that I was obsessed with her , and she ended up transferring classrooms because of it . "
562490	562496	562497	562497	Chandler	676	“ So then what happened ? ”
562525	562571	562515	562515	I	884	" Long story short , the two of us did n't get along , and by the summer after tenth grade , I 'd had enough of it . So when both of our families summered together at the Hamptons , I upped my game . "
562572	562576	562577	562577	Chandler	676	" You know , "
562583	562602	562577	562577	Chandler	676	" this is almost as good as Scandal . And that has a Pierce Industries in it too . "
562628	562636	562637	562637	Chandler	676	“ So ? What did you do ? ”
562640	562655	562637	562637	Chandler	676	" I convinced Satcher 's parents that one of them was having an affair . "
562787	562809	562810	562810	I	884	“ How was I supposed to know that neither parent would feel emotionally capable of handling their son on their own ? ”
562821	562831	562814	562814	Chandler	676	“ What does that mean ? I ’m lost . ”
562832	562844	562845	562845	Jordan	7091	" They got divorced and sent their kid to boarding school , ”
562864	562882	562861	562861	I	884	" An all - boys school in upstate Connecticut . I have n't spoken to him since . ”
562896	562909	562883	562883	Chandler	676	" But that 's … that 's … that 's so mean ! ”
562910	562928	562929	562929	Jordan	7091	“ That type of unresolved animosity from one ’s formative years might show up later in life . ”
562954	562960	562948	562948	I	884	“ I ’ll follow up . ”
562961	562970	562971	562971	Chandler	676	“ And you should say you ’re sorry ! "
562997	563023	562976	562976	I	884	" I 'm not sorry . That preppy little asshole wreaked havoc in my life . I was glad to see him out of it . "
563068	563217	563030	563031	my brother	7091	" I do n't expect you to grovel for me either , Chandler . If that ’s the route you choose to go , that ’s on you . Frankly , I ’m not keen on going into a business venture with him , either . My original intent had been … more subversive . If you had asked me , I would n’t have approved of the route you chose , clearly . But since you ’re already walking that path , I recommend you use our dislike for each other to your advantage . Assure him that my feelings for him are mutual and that a partnership will both keep an enemy close and allow him to make money off me at the same time . He might find that gratifying . It ’s the only reason I ’m allowing you to keep on with this proposal .
563218	563228	563229	563229	I	884	“ Or , you could take the simpler alternative , ”
563232	563274	563229	563229	I	884	“ Call the secretary back , charm her into giving you the number of a consultant to help revive the club , and you wo n’t have to do any more business with Rutherford at all . It ’s your choice . ”
563347	563414	563415	563415	I	884	“ Now I ’d love to stay and listen to you continue to compare my very real life to some overly - dramatic television show that has obviously used the name of our company in it ’s scripting — Jordan , make a note to talk to a trademark lawyer — but I have another place I need to be . Enjoy your time in Austin . ”
563552	563558	563559	563559	I	884	“ My mission was fruitless , ”
563594	563600	563583	563583	she	7384	“ Tell me about it . ”
563601	563617	563618	563618	I	884	“ Mira did n’t think I should be investigating . In case it ’s dangerous . ”
563658	563670	563693	563693	She	7384	“ I feel like I might have said the same thing … ”
563671	563688	563689	563689	I	884	“ And then you took it back , which is what makes you a better friend , ”
563794	563803	563804	563804	I	884	" Help me take my mind off it , ”
563814	563831	563804	563804	I	884	“ Tell me something going on in your life . Anyone from the past haunting JC ? "
563835	563840	563841	563841	She	816	" No , but … "
563882	563898	563871	563871	she	816	" JC and I did decide that we 're going to go to that party . "
563899	563908	563909	563909	I	884	" The sex party ? The orgy party ? "
563931	563934	563935	563935	Her	816	" Shh . "
563940	563977	563935	563935	Her	816	" It 's called an erotic party , and yes . We 're going tomorrow night , so by the next time I see you , I should be able to tell you all about it . "
563978	563991	563992	563992	I	884	" I want you to tell me all about it right now . "
563996	564023	563992	563992	I	884	" What are you going to wear ? What are you going to do ? Oh , shit , what if you see someone you know ? "
564042	564075	564076	564076	She	7391	" It 's formal attire and both JC and I have decided to wear masks . We are not doing anything . We are simply going as spectators . That 's all . "
564082	564111	564076	564076	She	7391	“ And while I ’m scolding you , it ’s time to get you downstairs . My impression of Lee is that he 's a pretty punctual man . "
564122	564137	564112	564112	I	884	" All right , all right . But I want details after , okay ? "
564138	564152	564076	564076	She	7391	" Same to you . Tell me everything Lee says . Good luck ! "
564195	564206	564207	564207	I	884	" Elsa , is there someone here to see me ? "
564216	564232	564210	564210	She	7394	" Yes , Mrs. Pierce . He 's waiting for you in Bubble Room Four . "
564368	564374	564375	564375	I	884	" Mr. Ch — Hudson . "
564404	564411	564412	564412	I	884	" What are you doing here ? "
564441	564452	564453	564453	he	592	" I could ask you the same thing , Precious , "
564469	564489	564453	564453	he	592	" You said you were n’t going anywhere today . When I told you to stay put . Remember ? "
564502	564512	564513	564513	I	884	" Not a princess in a tower . Remember ? "
564516	564540	564499	564499	I	884	" Which is why I thought you might care to have lunch , away from the penthouse . Join me , will you ? "
564576	564583	564557	564558	Lee Chong	557	" No . I ca n't . "
564589	564594	564584	564584	His	592	" You ca n't ? "
564595	564614	564615	564615	I	884	" I mean , I 'm not happy with you . Why would I want to have lunch ? "
564623	564633	564634	564634	His	592	" For exactly that reason . To make up . "
564676	564699	564670	564670	I	884	" That 's really sweet of you , Hudson , but I 'm going to have to decline . Enjoy your lunch . "
564711	564720	564721	564721	Hudson	605	" Lee Chong is n't meeting with you , "
564759	564766	564751	564751	I	884	" How did you know about — "
564767	564812	564732	564732	My	884	" He called me last night before I left work . Wanted to know if it was okay to discuss major purchases and renovations with my wife . He seems to be a bit of a traditionalist — used to only dealing with men . "
564824	564848	564813	564813	I	884	" Traditionalist , you say ? Wonder how he ’s going to take it when he finds out his daughter 's a lesbian . "
564849	564854	564896	564896	Hudson	605	" What was that ? "
564855	564858	564813	564813	I	884	" Nevermind . "
564876	564895	564866	564866	Liesl	166	" And so what — you told him no ? Is that why he 's not here today ? "
564903	564952	564896	564896	Hudson	605	" Of course not . I told him The Sky Launch belongs to you . What you do with it and how you choose to run this business has nothing to do with me . It bothers me that you would think that I would say anything different . "
564962	564982	564953	564953	I	884	" I 'm sorry , H. It 's just , you 're here , and he 's … not . "
564983	565010	565062	565062	He	884	" He said it was due to an unrelated matter that he needed to reschedule . I assumed that he ’d called you directly as well . "
565015	565061	565011	565011	I	884	" Bullshit . You knew he would n't call me and reschedule — the traditionalist who does n't want to deal with women — and that 's why you were here . To catch me in the act of doing something sneaky behind your back . "
565065	565071	565062	565062	He	884	" Me ? Do that ? "
565118	565130	565112	565112	my	884	" Come sit down . Join me for lunch , Alayna . "
565214	565238	565197	565197	she	8217	" Do you want to tell me about this grand plan of yours ? How it involves Lee Chong and his event space ? "
565338	565356	565357	565357	I	884	" Are you ready to tell me everything about your investigation on this threat against our family ? "
565387	565396	565397	565397	I	884	" Yeah . That 's what I thought . "
565536	565547	565548	565548	he	605	" We used to do very fun things in these , "
565554	565571	565572	565572	I	884	" I had babies , Hudson . No one has fun in bubble rooms after babies , "
565575	565582	565548	565548	he	605	" The babies do n't mean — "
565588	565601	565602	565602	I	884	" The babies mean everything ! Someone 's threatening them , H ! ”
565724	565767	565773	565773	his	605	" I got you . I wo n't let anything hurt you . I wo n’t let anything hurt our babies . I swear to you , my love . My precious . Nothing will happen to any of you . Ever . "
566135	566155	566156	566156	she	8844	" Did I sleep through the entire afternoon , or did you abandon your work obligations just for me ? "
566184	566205	566174	566174	I	884	" I 've rearranged the entire week ’s schedule for this project . Which has been very much for you . "
566210	566226	566206	566206	Her	8844	" This project being the one where you are investigating those threatening letters . Right ? "
566227	566230	566231	566231	I	884	" Right , "
566327	566334	566335	566335	she	8844	" I ’m scared , Hudson , ”
566355	566387	566335	566335	she	8844	“ I know , and I do n’t want you to be scared . I want you to let me worry about it so you do n’t have to be scared . ”
566388	566484	566485	566485	My	884	“ I know that ’s what you want , but that ’s not how things work . Especially not for me . It 's one thing to have this menace looming over us , and to not know anything about it . It makes my mind go crazy . Makes me imagine the worst things , no matter how safe you tell me I am . How protected you try to make me feel . It 's a whole other issue , a whole other hurt , to realize you 've been shutting me out . "
566496	566505	566485	566485	My	884	" I know , precious . I am — "
566506	566513	566514	566514	she	7423	" Let me finish . Please , "
566555	566600	566601	566601	She	7423	" You used to have such a thick wall around you . I remember thinking if I could only get inside , if I could just break down your barrier , everything would be okay between us . That we could be perfect together . "
566630	566706	566601	566601	She	7423	" And I was right , H. When you finally let me in — we were magic . I felt whole and unstoppable with the complete Hudson Pierce at my side . That 's what makes me feel safe , Hudson — you . When you give me all of you . When you stand beside me and treat me like your partner . When you hold my hand and tell me we got this . "
566719	566775	566707	566707	She	7425	" I get what you 're trying to do here , keeping this away from me . I get that you do n’t want me to have to feel it . But you also should n’t feel this alone . This is n't us at our best . Us at our best is a team . "
566789	566807	566776	566776	She	7425	" We need to do this as a team . We do n't work any other way . "
566826	566840	566822	566822	she	7425	" I was actually thinking the same thing . While you were sleeping . "
566849	566852	566841	566841	Her	7425	" Really ? ”
566853	566883	566841	566841	Her	7425	“ Yes . Really . I think we need to lay all our cards on the table . No more walls . I need you with me on this . ”
566895	566908	566892	566892	she	7425	“ Are you just saying that because you know you 've lost ? "
566919	566925	566909	566909	I	884	" I did not lose . "
566926	566951	566892	566892	she	7425	" It sure sounded like you lost to me . Because I got what I wanted , and you ’re giving me what I … "
566952	566959	566960	566960	I	884	" That 's not a loss , "
566963	566972	566960	566960	I	884	" It 's a concession of both parties . "
566973	566992	566993	566993	She	7425	" Actually , I really do n't feel like I had to concede much of anything at all . ”
567152	567164	567165	567165	I	884	" I did n't bring you back here to seduce you , "
567175	567183	567184	567184	Her	7425	" Maybe it 's what I need . ”
567190	567204	567184	567184	Her	7425	" Besides , it looks like I 'm the one doing the seducing . "
567320	567326	567327	567327	I	884	" Take off your dress , "
567685	567691	567692	567692	I	884	" You 're killing me , "
567711	567721	567722	567722	She	7425	" Then I guess I should do it again . "
568442	568450	568451	568451	I	884	" I need you safe , precious , "
568459	568507	568451	568451	I	884	" In every way . If everything I have done to make you feel safe has made you feel like we 're growing apart , then there 's no point . I need you to feel as safe as you are . I need you with me . "
568562	568565	568566	568566	she	7425	" Together , "
568569	568591	568556	568556	She	7425	" We 're doing this together . You 'll keep me safe . We ’ll keep the kids safe . Together . "
568592	568595	568596	568596	I	884	“ Together , ”
568920	568924	568925	568925	he	7436	" Thank you , "
568929	568935	568936	568936	He	7436	" We both appreciate it . "
568962	569001	568950	568950	he	7436	" Yes , Mirabelle , I should have talked to Alayna earlier , but we are working it all out now . I promise . We will see you Sunday and you can interrogate me about it then . "
569041	569048	569049	569049	I	884	" She 's watching the kids ? "
569064	569086	569033	569033	she	1120	" Yes . Jordan 's team is taking them over to her house . She ’ll keep them for the weekend . "
569104	569125	569033	569033	she	1120	" And it wo n't be too much of a handful for her ? Having all those kids plus hers ? "
569126	569162	569163	569163	He	884	" I sent Payton to help , and Mirabelle has a nanny of her own . She also said something about Sophia coming by — you know how she likes to hover over the grandkids . "
569184	569195	569196	569196	I	884	" And it will be safe enough at her house ? "
569237	569251	569252	569252	he	884	" Mirabelle 's house has state - of - the - art security , "
569256	569286	569252	569252	he	884	" And on top of that , we have some of Jordan ’s guys watching . Mirabelle already knows , so she wo n't kick them off the property . "
569355	569368	569349	569349	I	884	" H , does Jordan have men watching Mirabelle 's store too ? "
569375	569386	569369	569369	He	884	" Would you prefer the answer was yes or no ? "
569387	569396	569397	569397	I	884	“ I would prefer the answer is true , "
569438	569477	569435	569435	He	884	" There are men watching her store while she 's open . But do n't take that to mean that the threat has extended further than those letters you read . I 've just been taking extra precautions . "
569505	569570	569498	569498	I	884	" I 'm glad you did . Though Stacy 's noticed them , and I think it might 've been a good idea to give her and your sister a heads - up , because both of them can be pretty dramatic when they want to be about anything out of the ordinary . But I 'm glad you are looking out for them . "
569628	569665	569669	569669	his	884	" By the way , Jordan stopped by with some clothes for you while you were in the shower . He picked them up from the penthouse . I laid them on the bed for you . "
569679	569696	569669	569669	his	884	“ Or . You could wait to get dressed . And I could get undressed again . "
569719	569736	569707	569707	I	884	" Stay dressed . That was n't the reason we asked Mirabelle to take the kids . "
569744	569754	569737	569737	His	884	" You mean it was n't the only reason . ”
569755	569770	569771	569771	I	884	" I do n't seem to remember it being on the list at all . "
569795	569814	569771	569771	I	884	" We ’re supposed to be working as a team to figure out who 's harassing our family . "
569835	569850	569851	569851	His	884	" I think we work best as a team when I 'm inside you . "
569912	569921	569922	569922	I	884	" Can we at least eat dinner first ? "
569925	569930	569922	569922	I	884	“ I ’m starving . ”
569931	569935	569936	569936	he	884	" Dinner first , "
569951	569972	569922	569922	I	884	" Dinner where we lay everything out on the table ? Clear things up ? Get on the same page ? "
569977	569983	569973	569973	He	884	" Everything on the table . "
569984	569991	569992	569992	I	884	“ Not me on the table , ”
570005	570015	569992	569992	I	884	“ The things you ’ve been keeping from me . ”
570016	570026	570027	570027	he	884	“ All of that is a part of everything , ”
570099	570105	570106	570106	I	884	" Good . Thank you . "
570174	570181	570182	570183	A couple	787	" Can dinner be out somewhere ? "
570234	570279	570227	570227	He	884	" That sounds wonderful , precious . However , since we sent extra men to be at Mirabelle 's , the team is a little stretched . I 'd prefer we stay in . This building has an armed guard twenty - four seven . "
570359	570377	570352	570352	he	884	" Compromise ? We order in , but eat on the rooftop . How does that sound ? "
570378	570385	570352	570352	he	884	" Romantic . Thank you , H. "
570455	570473	570474	570474	he	884	" Why did n't you tell me about Lee Chong and your plans for The Sky Launch ? "
570577	570593	570574	570574	I	884	" It really is n't anything I spent much time on . Just a passing — "
570594	570609	570667	570667	He	884	" I saw your plans . You 've obviously spent extensive time on it . "
570617	570623	570624	570624	I	884	" You saw my plans ? "
570632	570650	570574	570574	I	884	" I found the folder on the desktop of your laptop . Your PowerPoint was very thorough . "
570659	570666	570667	570667	He	884	" You went through my laptop ! "
570681	570709	570667	570667	He	884	" While you were sleeping . The plans were brilliant . I loved every detail . The coffee shop and merchandising area was one of the highlights . "
570752	570758	570740	570740	he	884	“ Why are you fussing ? ”
570759	570769	570770	570770	I	884	" You looked at my laptop behind my back , "
570773	570790	570791	570791	he	884	" And you went through those letters that I had laid out while I was sleeping , "
570853	570861	570850	570850	I	884	" You really thought it was good ? "
570862	570865	570866	570866	he	884	" Brilliant , "
570871	570903	570866	570866	he	884	" Why would n't you tell me about that ? Did you think I would n't support you ? Did you think that I would object to you expanding the nightclub ? "
570948	570961	570943	570943	I	884	" I thought you 'd say it was n’t the right time . "
570972	571028	570943	570943	I	884	" Why ? Because the twins are still so young ? It was you who said you wanted to be home with them . I ca n't believe that I ever gave you the impression that I would n't want you working if that was what you wanted . I have always supported you in — "
571034	571056	571029	571029	I	884	" Because I did n't think you thought I could handle it . Not so soon . Not so soon after … "
571069	571135	571057	571057	His	7456	" That 's your fear talking , Alayna . It 's not fair to use me to personify your doubts . If you say you need to work , then you need to work . If you say you need to be on a beach in the Virgin Islands , then that ’s where we ’ll go . If you say you need another baby — "
571142	571150	571136	571136	I	884	" I do n't need another baby . "
571154	571169	571151	571151	He	7456	" You know what you need . And I 'll support whatever that is . "
571177	571191	571170	571170	I	884	" But you do n't really think my head ’s a crazy mess ? "
571196	571213	571170	571170	I	884	“ The other day , it seemed like you were afraid of my state of mind . ”
571229	571281	571214	571214	He	7456	" Your mind is the reason I fell in love with you , precious . Your sexy , brilliant , incredible , crazy , mess of a mind . Maybe it feels like it 's chaos in there sometimes , but I promise I would n't want you any other way . "
571298	571301	571302	571302	Hudson	168	“ Damn , ”
571393	571397	571398	571398	Hudson	168	“ Turn around , ”
571415	571426	571427	571427	he	7456	“ Are you sure we have to eat dinner first ? ”
571430	571442	571427	571427	he	7456	“ Because I ’m suddenly hungry for something other than food . ”
571527	571533	571534	571534	I	884	“ I ’ll feed you , ”
571537	571553	571534	571534	I	884	“ Whatever you want to eat . But first you assured me we ’d talk . ”
571554	571567	571577	571577	his	884	“ I did say we ’d do that , did n’t I ? ”
571650	571657	571658	571658	I	884	“ This is perfect , H , ”
571673	571682	571683	571683	He	884	“ You ’re perfect . Stunning , really . ”
571691	571722	571683	571683	He	884	“ Also , you ’re smart , funny , brave , and enough . According to Mina , it ’s not appropriate to only compliment a woman on her looks . ”
571726	571731	571723	571723	I	884	“ She ’s amazing . ”
571732	571737	571723	571723	I	884	“ She ’s you . ”
571738	571745	571746	571746	I	884	“ She ’s you , too . ”
571759	571763	571764	571764	he	884	“ She is , ”
571829	571838	571839	571839	I	884	" What was the first letter you received ? "
571858	571866	571852	571852	He	884	" You need to eat , Alayna . "
571867	571873	571852	571852	He	884	" I 'm not going — "
571874	571886	571852	571852	He	884	" I will talk , as long as you are eating . "
571908	571913	571914	571914	I	884	" I 'm eating , "
571921	571925	571914	571914	I	884	" Now go . "
571961	571976	571949	571949	he	884	" The first letter arrived when you were five months pregnant with the twins . "
572000	572185	571996	571996	He	884	" You had just been put on bedrest . The letter had shown up mixed in with some files from Human Resources , folded in a plain white envelope , no address . It was a mystery how it got to me without being screened , which made it unusual right off the bat . The language as well was deeply personal . Not many people were aware of your bedrest situation . That was still new — and it ’s not like I spend much time discussing our personal lives with other people regardless . Normally a vague letter such as that would n't cause alarm , except for those details . I handed it off to Jordan , who assured me it was nothing . A prankster . Someone with a chip on his shoulder . Possibly someone even in the building — which would explain how they ’d known about you , perhaps a stray word from Patricia overheard . Jordan said he ’d get to the bottom of the matter . He did n't recommend further action at that time . "
572186	572199	571996	571996	He	884	" But you increased security at home and at The Sky Launch . "
572230	572307	572218	572218	Hudson	7091	" You 've been doing your own investigating , I see . Yes , I did increase security . The letter made me realize we had n't had an update in a while , and the personalization had jarred me — I wo n't lie . I was more anxious than usual , with your difficult pregnancy , and I recognized that I might be overreacting , but it was better to be safe than sorry . "
572308	572317	572218	572218	Hudson	7091	" And you did n't tell me because … "
572318	572361	572362	572362	He	7462	" Because I knew I was being ridiculous . Paranoid . I was n't about to concern you with something that should have been a dead issue . Especially when Dr. Addison had warned that you needed to stay away from stress . "
572373	572381	572362	572362	He	7462	" Certainly , you can understand that . "
572455	572472	572473	572473	I	884	" Yes . I can understand why you did n't tell me then . Go on . "
572505	572571	572572	572572	My	884	" I 'd almost stopped having nightmares about the first letter when the second letter came . It showed up in the mailroom , addressed to me personally , so it was screened for toxic substances , but not read . It was delivered to me in a stack with a bunch of other items at the penthouse , because you had just given birth . "
572588	572617	572579	572579	I	884	" That must be the one that had a line like , ‘ Congratulations , you must think you 're the man of the year twice over . ’ "
572618	572622	572623	572623	he	7091	" That one , "
572626	572719	572623	572623	he	7091	" This was letter two , so it was obviously more alarming . Jordan ran all the tests , traced the return address to a post office downtown . Every lead led to a dead end . Again , Jordan believed it was just someone jealous of my life . Someone particularly triggered by my happy family . He did n't believe there was any real threat involved , and indeed , since the language in that letter was much more benign , it was easier to put out of my mind . "
572720	572757	572758	572758	I	884	" And you did n't tell me about it because I just had twins and it was n't a big deal and even your head of security was n't worried . Blah blah blah . Right ? "
572772	572785	572786	572786	he	7091	" Would you have said something , were you in my place ? "
572798	572802	572803	572803	I	884	" Probably not , "
572806	572813	572803	572803	I	884	" But definitely the third letter — "
572814	572820	572824	572824	he	7091	" Came six months later . "
572931	572943	572944	572944	he	7091	" Alayna , do n't you dare blame yourself for anything , "
572967	572978	572956	572956	I	884	" How do you even know what I 'm thinking ? "
572979	573039	572956	572956	I	884	" Because I know you . And it 's not your fault . Whatever you 're blaming yourself for . I did n't want you to be concerned with it . That 's why I did n't tell you . Not because I did n't think you could n't handle it . Or because you were n't strong enough . "
573096	573102	573103	573103	I	884	" Thank you , H , "
573118	573178	573103	573103	I	884	" Thank you for bearing all of this alone . I wish that I had been there with you , because I hate for you ever to have to bear things alone . But I 'm so very grateful that you are the kind of man who does . Who looks out for me and his children like that . "
573201	573250	573179	573179	He	7091	" The last two letters have come much more quickly . None of them have had fingerprints , none of them have led to any substantial location . All of them from random post offices in New York City . The last one was delivered to the penthouse — "
573261	573282	573179	573179	He	7091	" It 's when the picture of you arrived . That was last Friday . The bodyguards came after that . "
573336	573346	573347	573347	I	884	" Do you have any leads ? Any suspects ? "
573351	573407	573324	573324	You	7472	" I do n't know if you caught them , but there are specific references to a scheming manipulative Hudson . While those could be coincidence , Jordan and I are assuming that they indicate whoever is sending the letters is someone from my past , someone who was part of one of my games . "
573408	573414	573415	573415	I	884	" I thought as much . "
573492	573601	573610	573610	he	7091	" There are so many , it 's like looking for a needle in a haystack . I kept a digital journal in the early days of my experiments , but once I began working with Celia , she took over the journal writing . There have been too many years , too many casualties … Honestly , until that photograph of you , I 'd begun to believe it was someone who just wanted to vent . But if he — or she — is upset enough to go to the trouble of following you , of taking your picture and sending it to me … Well . "
573602	573606	573607	573607	I	884	" I know , "
573678	573696	573672	573672	I	884	" Does Judith Cleary have something against you ? Could it possibly be her sending the letters ? "
573702	573713	573697	573697	Hudson	7091	" Judith Cleary ? However did you hear that name ? "
573747	573771	573741	573741	she	215	" She 's on the Board of Directors . She obviously has it out for you . Why is she so against you ? "
573775	573785	573786	573786	He	6778	" I did not manipulate or scheme Judith Cleary . "
573789	573792	573772	573772	He	6778	" Much . "
573800	573812	573793	573793	I	884	" Obviously , she has some kind of grudge against you . "
573813	573833	573834	573834	His	6778	" And I have one against her . That woman is petty , narcissistic , and self - involved . ”
573841	573887	573834	573834	His	6778	" She had Mirabelle kicked out of their girls ’ club after Sophia showed up to one of the parent meetings drunk . While I do n't condone my mother 's behavior , she most definitely should n't have taken it out on her child . "
573928	573949	573950	573950	I	884	" So what did you do ? Because you must 've done something for her to be mad at you . "
573971	573986	573967	573967	Hudson	7091	" I had her kicked out of the country club . For unfit citizenship . "
573990	574017	573987	573987	I	884	" You would think she would 've learned her lesson . Here she is trying to take it out on another kid . What a bitch . "
574023	574052	574018	574018	His	7091	" I 'm sorry I ruined Mina 's chances for going to our legacy school . I will call Judith and grovel . See what I can do . "
574053	574094	573987	573987	I	884	" Please do n't bother . We do n't want that kind of school , our daughter playing with those kinds of people . We can find something better . Besides , there ’s no way you ’d apologize convincingly . "
574167	574201	574156	574156	I	884	" I know we 've had many rooftop dinners in our marriage , but this was nice . I mean , the conversation sucks , but the rest of it I 'll keep . "
574202	574214	574156	574156	I	884	“ I know something we ’ve never done on a rooftop . ”
574215	574232	574156	574156	I	884	“ We ’ve had sex on a rooftop before , H. You ’re losing your memory . ”
574270	574293	574294	574294	His	7091	“ Sex was not what I was referring to . And do n’t you dare think I do n’t remember that night . ”
574321	574329	574318	574318	I	884	“ Then what are you referring to ? ”
574369	574390	574396	574397	the man	676	" You follow me on Spotify ? I thought you just used that app to play lullabies for the babies . "
574403	574415	574416	574416	he	676	" I saw you added this one a few weeks ago , "
574460	574468	574469	574469	he	676	" The babies love this particular song , "
574482	574488	574489	574489	I	884	" What are we doing ? "
574497	574510	574511	574511	He	676	" We 're dancing . We 've never danced on a rooftop . "
574526	574533	574520	574520	I	884	" This is good , right ? "
574534	574544	574511	574511	He	676	" Super good . And it 's our song . "
574628	574634	574635	574635	I	884	" I like this arrangement , "
574639	574713	574635	574635	I	884	" Before it was always as if you were singing it to me . John Legend 's voice — I always imagined it was you telling me that you were giving me all of you . But in this version , there 's a woman singing too . And I like that because I feel like I 'm saying it back to you . Telling you that you get all of me too . "
574730	574742	574743	574743	he	676	" This is n't how I dreamed our life would be , "
574752	574765	574743	574743	he	676	" This is n't the future I dreamed I would give you . "
574778	574838	574766	574766	I	884	" What do you mean ? Our life is fantastic . I could n't want for anything . You gave me three children . You ’ve given me a home . Given me my nightclub . My books . My friends . My sanity . Everything I have that is good and wonderful is because of you , Hudson . "
574844	574871	574839	574839	He	676	" I also gave you my past . I gave you security guards . I gave you a reason to go to bed at night scared . "
574872	574884	574839	574839	He	676	“ And I gave you OCD and obsessions and difficult pregnancies . "
574885	574892	574893	574893	he	676	" Those were n't your fault , "
574896	574906	574907	574907	I	884	" And neither is any of this yours now . "
574943	574994	574937	574937	He	676	" The things that are happening now — these threats — Alayna , you have to face that they ’ve come about because of somebody I once was . That they are happening because of things I once did . I caused this . I 'm the one to blame . "
575016	575059	575060	575060	He	676	" You were the man you were because of terrible circumstances . Because no one showed you that you could be somebody else . Because your mother and father convinced you that you were unfeeling and uncaring , and you believed them . "
575073	575125	575068	575068	I	884	" And it does n't matter if everything you did was with your free will , because whomever you were before is what made you into the man that I fell in love with . The only reason there is any now with us is because there was once a then . "
575149	575223	575126	575126	I	884	" We were both broken , Hudson . And we fixed each other . When you first played me this song , the perfect future that I dreamed of with you ? Was any future with you at all . And you ’ve given me that and so much more . I 'm sorry if you find our life together disappointing , because it 's been more wonderful than I could ever imagine . "
575224	575264	575297	575297	He	7489	" No , precious , I did n't mean that . I have n't been disappointed for a single second . I 'm only disappointed right now , through this . That I ca n't keep you safe and — "
575270	575296	575265	575265	I	884	" I am safe . I 'm with you . We are together , and that 's all I need to be safe , remember ? "
575303	575312	575313	575313	I	884	“ We ’re going to figure this out , "
575392	575426	575389	575389	he	6778	" I 'm still going to give you that future I dreamed of . We ’ll get rid of this baggage from the past , and then we will be safe for good . "
575486	575491	575492	575492	I	884	" I believe you , "
575496	575512	575492	575492	I	884	“ I ’ll be here when it happens . I ’m here until then too . ”
575554	575577	575537	575537	I	884	" We both know what we have to do to make progress on this . And I 'm ready . Are you ? "
575578	575588	575589	575589	he	6778	" If you 're with me , I am , "
575593	575597	575598	575598	I	884	" Okay then . "
575615	575623	575598	575598	I	884	" It 's time to call Celia . "
576153	576169	576170	576170	Alayna	168	" Tomorrow . 6 PM . Celia will meet us at Randall 's for drinks . "
576388	576397	576398	576398	she	9246	" That was n't the man I married , "
576501	576516	576517	576517	She	9246	" Why did we choose Randall 's ? We do n't usually go there . "
576532	576544	576545	576545	I	884	" It was a random point between our location and hers , "
576627	576637	576638	576638	she	9246	" She knows why we want to see her ? "
576643	576646	576647	576647	I	884	" No . "
576651	576690	576691	576691	She	9246	" Then why did she agree to meet us ? That does n't seem like her . To walk into a situation without knowing what she was dealing with ? That seems highly suspicious . Does n't it ? "
576719	576735	576736	576736	I	884	" I suspect that she thinks that I 'm going to discuss business with her , ”
576739	576767	576736	576736	I	884	“ She wants me to let her and her husband purchase equal shares in Werner Media so that our three - point alliance no longer favors us . "
576768	576774	576775	576775	Alayna	168	" Of course she does , "
576779	576794	576775	576775	Alayna	168	" Did she really ask you that directly ? Or are you just guessing ? "
576795	576826	576848	576848	Alayna	168	" She asked directly . She said that if I do n't let her buy shares , they will find them somewhere else . That was a few weeks ago . "
576857	576864	576848	576848	Alayna	168	" You spoke to her recently ? "
576913	576939	576940	576940	I	884	" I spoke to her , but just once . We have a business relationship . There will be times that we have to speak . "
577017	577022	577023	577023	she	168	" You 're right , "
577026	577030	577031	577031	She	168	" I overreacted . "
577056	577069	577031	577031	She	168	" Are you sure Celia is n't the one sending the letters ? "
577077	577080	577070	577070	We	7511	" No . "
577081	577086	577087	577087	Alayna	168	" She 's late , "
577116	577125	577126	577126	I	884	" Maybe she hit traffic coming from downtown . "
577134	577156	577126	577126	I	884	" Or she had a hard time getting away . You remember how it is when your baby ’s that young . "
577162	577168	577157	577157	Alayna	168	" Are you defending her ? "
577173	577201	577169	577169	I	884	" No . Just , she 's not even here yet . I thought we could save the judgment and the daggers until she 's earned it . "
577220	577229	577230	577230	She	168	" How very fair and noble of you . ”
577390	577396	577397	577397	I	884	" Speak of the devil , "
577798	577803	577804	577804	she	9246	" Hudson , Laynie , "
577851	577863	577864	577864	Celia	9246	" I did n't know we were bringing our significant others , "
577880	577893	577864	577864	Celia	9246	" Should I call Edward ? He does n't have any plans . "
577894	577901	577902	577902	I	884	" That wo n’t be necessary , "
577936	577952	577919	577919	her	9246	" This conversation does n't involve him . It does , however , involve Alayna . "
577973	577978	577962	577962	she	9246	" I 'm intrigued . ”
577990	578019	577979	577979	She	9246	“ How are you , Laynie ? It 's been so long since we 've seen each other face - to - face . You look … tired . "
578062	578073	578074	578074	I	884	" What can we get you to drink , Celia ? "
578083	578091	578092	578092	She	168	" Nothing . Water , I suppose . "
578106	578109	578110	578110	I	884	" Really ? "
578123	578145	578110	578110	I	884	" You were the one who suggested we meet at a bar , and you ’re not even having a drink ? "
578161	578186	578187	578187	She	168	" I 'm nursing . I ca n't drink , unless I 'm going to dump it all after , and I 'm not . "
578201	578227	578187	578187	She	168	" But we all know you ’re in a much more agreeable mood when you 've had one of these . Hence , the bar . "
578269	578303	578304	578304	I	884	" I changed my mind . We do n’t need to meet with you . This is n’t going to get us anywhere . Alayna , grab your purse . We are leaving . "
578355	578358	578359	578359	Alayna	168	" Hudson , "
578370	578375	578359	578359	Alayna	168	" We should stay . "
578469	578513	578457	578457	Celia	9246	" Thank you . I would hate to have wasted this trip . Now , since Edward is not involved in this matter and Alayna is , I am assuming that we are not here to speak about the three - point alliance ? "
578529	578533	578534	578534	I	884	" That is — "
578543	578576	578534	578534	I	884	" Like Pierce Industries is going to sell you shares . Did you forget that we have the majority for a reason ? Hudson needed to have something to hold — ow ! "
578625	578630	578631	578631	I	884	" That is correct , "
578634	578643	578644	578644	I	884	" We are here to ask you for … "
578659	578662	578644	578644	I	884	" Assistance . "
578668	578699	578663	578663	Celia	9246	" This is interesting . You must be mighty desperate if you ’re asking me for help . You have to know that 's going to indenture you to me . "
578721	578737	578738	578738	I	884	" Why do n't you hear the situation out before you start bartering about payment ? "
578756	578793	578738	578738	I	884	“ At one time , you and I helped each other with no strings attached . Especially when we found the outcome benefitted both of us . You might find this is one of those times . ”
578804	578813	578794	578794	Celia	9246	" Go on then . I ’m listening . "
578833	578856	578825	578825	Alayna	168	" We have received a series of threats recently . Letters , addressed to me , containing menacing language toward my family . "
578862	578870	578857	578857	Celia	9246	" And you think I did it ? "
578871	578878	578879	578879	I	884	" No , we did n’t — ”
578882	578885	578886	578886	Alayna	168	" Well … "
578906	578931	578932	578932	I	884	" We did n’t come here to accuse you . But the threats reference the past . The time when you and I were … "
578954	578958	578959	578959	Celia	9246	" Playing together , "
578979	578996	578959	578959	Celia	9246	" I see . Do you have these letters with you ? May I read them ? "
579110	579119	579120	579120	Celia	9246	" This reference about the mask you wear , "
579129	579141	579120	579120	Celia	9246	" could be referring to that masquerade party we went to . "
579152	579160	579142	579142	She	9246	" But none of the rest fits . "
579203	579227	579193	579193	she	9246	" That one contained a picture of Alayna in the park with the twins . She had n't known she 'd been photographed . "
579248	579251	579239	579239	Celia	9246	" Hm . "
579267	579310	579253	579253	she	9246	" I do think you 're right , that it ’s someone from the past . But it 's like a scavenger hunt . You have to do a lot of digging before you can figure out what these vague clues mean . "
579318	579332	579311	579311	I	884	" We were hoping that you would help us put those clues together . "
579366	579379	579358	579358	she	9246	" I ca n't do that . I ca n't take these . "
579398	579415	579387	579387	she	9246	" I 'm sorry that I ca n't be more helpful , I just ca n't . "
579442	579452	579416	579416	Alayna	168	" You ca n't ? Or you wo n't ? "
579474	579489	579490	579490	I	884	" We do n't have to take up much of your time , Celie , "
579511	579528	579499	579499	I	884	" If you even just allowed us access to the journals so we could piece together — "
579529	579533	579537	579537	her	9246	" The journals ? "
579539	579569	579570	579570	She	9246	" I do n't have them here . They ’re in London . I 'm sorry . It 's not going to work . I ca n't help you . ”
579579	579594	579570	579570	She	9246	" Now , if you 'll excuse me , I really must be going . "
579611	579614	579615	579615	I	884	" Dammit , "
579628	579633	579634	579634	I	884	" Celia , wait . ”
579647	579679	579634	579634	I	884	" This person could come after you , too . I might only be victim number one . You are n't innocent here . Your past is as tainted as mine . "
579680	579704	579705	579705	She	9246	" And I understand I 'll be on my own if and when that happens . I ca n't help you , Hudson . "
579747	579755	579756	579756	I	884	" I really thought you 'd softened , "
579782	579794	579772	579772	Her	9246	" You know nothing about me , Hudson . Not anymore . "
579837	579843	579844	579844	Alayna	168	" She 's playing us , "
579855	579886	579844	579844	Alayna	168	" She 's the one behind all of this . She expected us to come straight to her and we played straight into her hands . We ’re so stupid ! "
579928	579940	579920	579920	she	9246	" Do n't you think I 've already considered this possibility ? "
579968	579989	579990	579990	She	9246	" I know you considered it as a possibility . But now I 'm saying that 's what it is . ”
579996	580024	579990	579990	She	9246	“ Do you realize that 's what it is too ? Because what else is it ? It 's either that or she 's just plain mean . "
580099	580104	580105	580105	I	884	" She seemed spooked , "
580124	580134	580118	580118	Alayna	168	" Spooked ? What do you think we are ? "
580145	580151	580152	580152	I	884	" The kids are home . ”
580198	580204	580205	580205	she	608	" They ’re all asleep , "
580209	580218	580205	580205	she	608	" You can take Mina from the bodyguard . "
580270	580276	580277	580277	she	1858	" If it 's Celia , "
580280	580309	580277	580277	she	1858	" that means we are n't really in danger , right ? She just wants to scare us . She would n’t ever really hurt anybody . Right ? "
580348	580358	580332	580332	I	884	" I really do n't think it ’s Celia . "
580380	580439	580440	580440	She	1858	" We had a great weekend . Mina really enjoyed the time with Aryn . I think Holden is getting a new tooth — he 's been extra fussy and a little feverish . I gave him Tylenol two hours ago and he did n’t eat much tonight . I ’ll check on him again before I leave . "
580452	580465	580440	580440	She	1858	" I ’m going to go get their things from the car . "
580466	580472	580473	580473	Alayna	168	" Thank you , Payton , "
580482	580489	580490	580490	I	884	" Oh , I almost forgot . "
580512	580551	580507	580507	I	884	" There was that birthday party on Friday afternoon . Mina got this from one of the parents . Probably an invitation to another one . You know how it 's always the same kids invited to them . "
580574	580578	580579	580579	Alayna	168	" Hudson … ? "
580588	580593	580594	580594	I	884	" I 'm here , "
580635	580642	580643	580643	I	884	" Where did Mina get this ? "
580647	580657	580658	580658	Payton	608	" She said a parent gave it to her , "
580672	580681	580658	580658	Payton	608	" One of the dads at the party . "
580692	580698	580699	580699	I	884	" Where was this party ? "
580710	580715	580699	580699	I	884	" At Central Park . "
580726	580746	580747	580747	I	884	" Thank you , Payton . Make sure one of the guards walks with you down to the garage . "
580867	580874	580859	580859	Alayna	168	" But what does that mean ? "
580875	580885	580886	580886	I	884	" It 's something that I used to say , "
580889	580895	580859	580859	Alayna	168	" Who would know that ? "
580900	580903	580896	580898	Only one person	7573	" Celia . "
580906	580915	580916	580916	I	884	" She ca n't get away with this , "
580943	580951	580931	580931	I	884	" What hotel is she staying at ? "
580978	580985	580965	580965	He	7575	" Alayna , you 're not — "
580992	581036	580986	580986	I	884	" Not going to talk to her ? Oh yes I fucking am . What hotel is she staying at ? I know you know , and if you do n't tell me , I 'm going to text Genevieve and ask her . ”
581061	581080	581082	581083	my husband	6778	" Confronting her is only going to play right into her hands . Just like you said earlier . "
581107	581128	581090	581090	I	884	" We 'll take it to the police tomorrow and handle this the correct way . File a restraining order . "
581203	581279	581196	581196	I	884	" She got my child involved . Our four - year - old little girl . Give me the fucking hotel name , Hudson , because I am going to go there and give her a fucking piece of my mind , and so help me , if you do n't let me do it right now , you know that I will do it later . So you might as well just tell me . "
581351	581354	581355	581355	Hudson	168	" Payton , "
581362	581385	581355	581355	Hudson	168	" Would you be able to stay a couple of extra hours ? Alayna suddenly remembered an errand we needed to run . "
581436	581457	581458	581458	she	1858	" Sure . Mind if I borrow something from your library to read , since the kids are all sleeping ? "
581461	581474	581475	581475	I	884	" Yeah , that 's fine . Take your pick of whatever , "
581546	581552	581553	581553	I	884	" Are n’t you coming ? "
581569	581582	581583	581583	He	615	" Thank you , Payton . Make sure you set the alarm . "
581602	581631	581632	581633	That woman	8674	" You better not think you ’re going to come up with some classic Hudson Pierce way to distract me from this . I am talking to her . "
581678	581759	581667	581667	Hudson	168	" Nope , I ’m not trying to stop you . I 'm texting the driver now . You reminded me that when you get your mind set on something , you do n't let it go . But if you think I 'm going to let you do this on your own , then you do n’t know me . Besides , I have a feeling this will be entertaining . I would n’t miss it for the world . ”
581906	581925	581926	581926	Hudson	7091	" Yes , I 'm certain that Celia is the only one that I shared that quote with , "
581934	581969	581926	581926	Hudson	7091	" but something does n't line up . This does n't feel like her M.O. I ca n't put my finger on it , but I still do n't think she 's behind this . "
581970	581979	581980	581980	I	884	" Oh , she 's definitely behind this , "
581992	582021	581980	581980	I	884	" And I do n't know what you mean by this is n't her M.O. Riling us up ? Trying to scare me ? That 's totally her . "
582069	582071	582073	582073	her	7594	“ coincidence ”
582112	582121	582122	582122	Hudson	7091	" She 's usually trying to terrify you , "
582147	582157	582122	582122	Hudson	7091	" She is n't usually trying to terrify me . "
582271	582279	582280	582281	our driver	2569	" Shall I come in with you ? "
582330	582333	582327	582327	I	884	" Yes . ”
582342	582349	582339	582339	Hudson	7091	" That will not be necessary . "
582356	582387	582350	582350	I	884	" You do n't even want to try to intimidate her ? We ’ll look a whole lot stronger if we go up there with a bodyguard on our side . "
582394	582450	582388	582388	Hudson	7091	" I 'm trying to prevent a scene . I 'm sure she will be more than intimidated at the sight of you as worked up as you are and me behind you . You can circle around , Andrews . We wo n't be too long . I 'll text when we ’re done . "
582625	582633	582634	582634	I	884	" Do you know her room number ? "
582661	582665	582666	582666	Hudson	7091	" I do , "
582670	582692	582666	582666	Hudson	7091	" But how do you expect to get up to her floor ? The elevator requires a key card to work . "
582698	582713	582693	582693	I	884	" Oh , God . It 's as if you 've never stalked anyone . "
582794	582798	582799	582800	the lady	9460	" What floor ? "
582834	582841	582842	582842	he	7091	" Oh . Twenty - seven , ”
582845	582865	582866	582866	I	884	" I have n't found the key yet . Just a minute . I know it 's in here , "
582879	582886	582887	582888	the lady	9460	" We can get you up , "
582903	582912	582887	582888	the lady	9460	" You 're on your own after that . "
582913	582948	582949	582949	I	884	" Thank you . My mother 's in the room so if I ca n't find the key , she can at least let us in . That 's so helpful . Thanks again . "
582967	582976	582977	582977	he	884	" You probably did n't even grab it , "
582989	583004	582977	582977	he	884	" You 're always leaving the room without the key . My forgetful girl . "

583206	583210	583211	583211	I	884	" Of course , "
583252	583260	583261	583261	he	884	" We should be adult about this , "
583264	583274	583261	583261	he	884	" Handle this civilly . In an appropriate manner . "
583275	583279	583280	583280	I	884	" Mm hm . "
583302	583317	583261	583261	he	884	" Alayna , you hear me ? You 're going to behave , right ? "
583318	583321	583322	583322	I	884	" Totally . "
583367	583373	583360	583360	she	9246	" … probably turndown service . "
583459	583468	583469	583469	I	884	" How dare you ? How dare you ? "
583531	583586	583517	583517	he	7632	" It 's one thing to mess with me , but you crossed a line when you involved my child . You are unbelievable , you know that ? It 's unfathomable that anyone , let alone another mother , could do this to someone else , just for kicks . How dare you ? "
583587	583594	583595	583595	Hudson	168	" Civil , Alayna , remember ? "
583606	583613	583614	583614	Celia	9246	" Jesus , what the fuck ? "
583627	583636	583637	583637	I	884	" Exactly , what the fuck , Celia ? "
583640	583647	583648	583648	Hudson	168	" Hold on , hold on , "
583722	583729	583730	583730	she	9246	" Where did you get this ? "
583733	583743	583744	583744	Hudson	168	" Someone gave it to Mina at the park , "
583747	583752	583753	583753	she	9246	" Oh my God , "
583763	583808	583756	583756	I	884	" It was you ! You 're so fucking sick . Hudson said you 'd changed , but you will never change . You have no heart . Manipulating and conniving . Does your husband know what … what a … dragon he married ? "
583834	583835	583831	583831	he	884	commands—“stay ”
583837	583838	583839	583839	Celia	9246	“ calm”—and
583859	583868	583831	583831	he	884	" What the hell is going on here ? "
584091	584094	584095	584095	she	9246	" Edward , ”
584104	584117	584095	584095	she	9246	" It 's nothing . Hudson and Alayna are ... old friends . "
584118	584125	584126	584126	I	884	" Old friends , my ass , "
584159	584165	584166	584166	Edward	545	" Is there a problem ? "
584175	584191	584166	584166	Edward	545	" I did n't realize that you and Hudson Pierce had been friends , darling . "
584262	584270	584250	584250	I	884	" Actually , there is a problem . "
584271	584274	584275	584275	Hudson	168	" Alayna , "
584284	584294	584275	584275	Hudson	168	" Edward , you have n't met my wife . "
584295	584312	584313	584313	He	545	" No , I have n't . And I hear we are about to be family . "
584354	584365	584378	584378	her	9246	" It 's a pleasure to meet you , Alayna . "
584366	584374	584375	584375	Celia	9246	" It 's really just a misunderstanding , "
584384	584402	584403	584403	His	545	" I 'd like to hear what Alayna has to say , if you do n't mind ? "
584423	584426	584417	584417	she	8674	" Alayna ? "
584436	584458	584430	584430	I	884	" Hudson and I are being terrorized . We have reason to suspect the threats may be coming from your wife . "
584459	584466	584467	584467	Hudson	168	" That 's not necessarily true , "
584537	584557	584533	584533	Celia	9246	" I have n't done anything to you . I did n't send a single one of those threats . "
584573	584581	584582	584582	I	884	" If she did n't do it , "
584585	584630	584631	584631	I	884	" She could prove it , and help us find out who is threatening us , at the same time . It would be easy , if she 'd let us see the journals that she kept from the time that she and Hudson … "
584672	584684	584685	584685	I	884	" Hudson and Celia had a working relationship in the past , "
584689	584713	584685	584685	I	884	" I do n't mean to butt into your marriage . It would be truly cruel and devious to interfere with your relationship . "
584719	584753	584714	584714	I	884	" And so I apologize if this is the first you are hearing about their former partnership . But my family ’s safety is on the line , and this is truly important . "
584792	584796	584797	584797	he	1483	" I see , "
584813	584828	584797	584797	he	1483	" I do know about Hudson and Celia 's working relationship , of course . "
584829	584833	584834	584834	I	884	" You do ? "
584849	584864	584865	584865	He	1483	" I do . Celia tells me everything . Do n't you , darling ? "
584893	584899	584886	584886	she	7646	" Well , almost everything . "
584957	585044	584951	584951	Edward	545	" I can guarantee you that Celia is not behind this . And to prove it , we will have the journals flown here from London . They can arrive here by Tuesday . You may come back then . Now , if you do n't mind , Celia needs to get some sleep . Our baby will be waking up in about five hours for her feeding , and you are correct , Celia really is a dragon when she has n't gotten enough sleep . "
585045	585048	585049	585049	I	884	" Damn , "
585095	585123	585085	585085	I	884	" I 've never seen Celia kowtow to anyone before . Did you see the way he just looked at her and she bent to his will ? "
585124	585133	585134	585134	Hudson	168	" I told you she fell in love , "
585152	585214	585085	585085	I	884	" What the fuck are you talking about ? Fell in love ? That was not love . That was some kind of mind control trick or maybe he has , like , a voodoo spell on her , or maybe he 's blackmailing her or something . It 's not love . And where are you taking me , anyway ? "
585227	585241	585242	585242	He	7650	" Love does n't always look like love to someone on the outside . "
585255	585275	585242	585242	He	7650	" This probably is n't going to look a lot like love right now , either . Turn around . "
585295	585307	585286	585286	I	884	" What is n't going to look like love ? Why ? "
585321	585338	585313	585313	his	7650	" The way I 'm going to fuck you . Because I 'm mad at you . "
585374	585384	585385	585385	I	884	“ Wait . I 'm mad at you too . "
585409	585426	585427	585427	He	7650	" Good . You can tell me all about it while my cock ’s inside you . "
585456	585495	585496	585496	I	884	" Well . If you ca n't figure it out on your own , you were a total asshole to me in there . You should 've stood up for me . Instead , you practically defended her . "
585542	585559	585524	585524	My	884	" You tried to hold me down . Which was demeaning and patronizing and … oh . "
585578	585583	585584	585584	he	7650	" Are you done ? "
585628	585643	585644	585644	He	7650	" Good . Then I 'll tell you why I 'm mad at you . "
585693	585703	585704	585704	he	7650	" You said you were going to be civil , "
585725	585758	585708	585708	he	7650	" You did n't trust me when I said I did n't think she was the one . You could have lost us the chance at getting access to those journals altogether . "
585801	585811	585787	585787	I	884	" I did get us the journals . Me . "
585812	585825	585826	585826	He	884	" And Jesus Christ , I 've never thought you were sexier . "
585838	585848	585826	585826	He	884	" Put your legs together . Make it tight . "
585922	585929	585931	585931	my	884	" Hudson , Hudson , Hudson , "
586132	586135	586136	586136	I	884	" Hudson , "
586154	586196	586136	586136	I	884	" If it 's not Celia , if Celia did n't do this ... if she did n't send the letters ... if she did n't send the card — it means there is somebody out there who wants to hurt us .
586197	586205	586243	586246	My precious little girl	3622	“ And he touched our little girl . "
586315	586348	586312	586312	Alayna	168	" It was probably someone the asshole hired . Not him personally . Probably some nobody who was given the task of passing a birthday invitation out to a particular little girl . "
586349	586356	586357	586357	I	884	" And if that 's true , "
586361	586375	586357	586357	I	884	" then that hired delivery man might lead us to our real guy . "
586376	586406	586407	586407	She	1858	" She 's four years old , Hudson . She ca n't possibly relay any information that 's useful . We might as well not involve her at all . "
586427	586454	586407	586407	She	1858	" Unless there was something really remarkable about the man . She is a smart kid . If the guy had a limp or an accent … "
586471	586500	586459	586459	she	1858	" I 'll send Jordan to talk to the mother that handled the birthday party . We 'll start there first . Mina will be a last resort . "
586818	586826	586827	586827	she	1858	" You really fucked up , Hudson , "
586840	586866	586827	586827	she	1858	" And you ca n't blame that on me . This was your doing . You 're the one who brought this to my house . "
586999	587019	586981	586981	I	884	" Did you do it ? Are you behind this ? Yes or no ? Once and for all . "
587033	587044	587020	587020	Her	1858	" No ! I told you , I did n't — "
587045	587078	587079	587079	I	884	" Then I did n't fuck up . We need those journals . We need them to solve this . Whatever it took to get them , I do n't regret it . "
587097	587154	587085	587085	She	1858	" I have always been real with you . No matter what I 've done , what schemes I 've pulled . I have still always been honest with you , when we were face to face . So when I say I did n't do this , you should know I 'm telling the truth . "
587181	587188	587189	587189	I	884	" How could I know anything ? "
587193	587203	587189	587189	I	884	" I do n't know you anymore . Remember ? "
587331	587336	587337	587337	she	1858	" Come on in , "
587355	587375	587376	587376	she	1858	" I 've already ordered tea and coffee — I did n't know which you preferred in the morning , "
587384	587422	587376	587376	she	1858	" I also have an assortment of fruits and breakfast pastries , in case you have n't eaten yet . I know sometimes it 's hard to remember to take care of yourself in times of stress . "
587430	587436	587437	587437	Alayna	168	" I 've already eaten , "
587448	587452	587445	587445	she	1858	" Thank you . "
587462	587472	587453	587453	Celia	9246	" They 're here if you change your mind . "
587473	587481	587482	587482	I	884	" How about we just get started ? "
587607	587613	587614	587614	I	884	" Where are the journals ? "
587622	587641	587642	587642	Celia	9246	" Since you ’re obviously not hungry either , Hudson , they 're in here . Follow me . "
587703	587712	587713	587713	I	884	" Is Edward working with us as well ? "
587721	587737	587738	587738	she	168	" No . He went into work . It ’s just us and the nanny , "
587880	587896	587897	587897	Celia	9246	" I do n't know if you had a plan about how to attack this , "
587922	588026	587897	587897	Celia	9246	" But I was thinking that you and I , Hudson , could each grab a journal and start reading through it . When we come to a name of someone involved in an experiment , we could record the name as well as any other details that may be important regarding the subject . Such as whether or not we believe they might still have hostile feelings toward you or me . Most of those references in the letters seemed vague , but if we come across anything that seems to possibly be referenced , then we can note that as well . "
588073	588080	588081	588081	she	9246	" If you have another plan … "
588098	588105	588094	588094	I	884	" No . This is good . "
588154	588160	588161	588161	Alayna	168	" What should I do ? "
588276	588318	588319	588319	She	9246	" You can do the recording , Alayna . As Celia and I read , we will call out information . If you could track it and sort it , I think that would be the best use of your time . "
588323	588335	588319	588319	She	9246	" I have my laptop . I could build a spreadsheet . ”
588343	588350	588336	588336	I	884	" That would be very helpful . "
588378	588387	588388	588388	I	884	" Let 's get to it , then . "
588622	588625	588626	588626	I	884	" Monica , "
588724	588727	588728	588728	I	884	" Graham , "
588738	588755	588728	588728	I	884	" Monica Graham . No threat level . Nothing that connects to anything in the letters . "
588756	588760	588761	588761	Celia	9246	" Timothy Kerrigan , "
588768	588773	588761	588761	Celia	9246	“ And Caroline Kerrigan . ”
588780	588784	588785	588785	she	9246	“ Book one , ”
588806	588818	588785	588785	she	9246	“ I picked it on purpose . I like chronological order . ”
588819	588822	588823	588823	I	884	“ Mm , ”
589185	589205	589206	589207	the woman	1124	" Excuse me , Mrs. Fasbender . I think she 's hungry . She wo n't take the binky , "
589218	589228	589229	589229	Celia	9246	" It 's about time for her to eat , "
589236	589247	589229	589229	Celia	9246	" I 'll take her . Thank you , Elsa . "
589410	589422	589423	589423	she	9246	" I remember what it 's like to be in love , "
589433	589444	589423	589423	she	9246	" I 'd like to feel that again … someday . "
589690	589700	589701	589701	Alayna	168	" Even grizzly bears care for their baby cubs , "
589824	589830	589831	589831	she	168	“ What ’s her name ? ”
589870	589873	589874	589874	Celia	9246	“ Cleo , ”
589899	589906	589874	589874	Celia	9246	" Is she a good baby ? "
589965	589985	589950	589950	Celia	9246	" She is , for the most part . I have a terrible time getting her to burp though . "
589996	590008	589950	589950	Celia	9246	" Too much of a little lady , are n't you ? "
590020	590025	590026	590026	She	168	" Can I try ? "
590037	590065	590066	590066	She	168	" Brett 's the same way . I swear it 's because she 's trying to get extra cuddle time . But I learned a few tricks . "
590074	590093	590096	590096	she	168	" It ’s worth a shot . She gets terrible tummyaches when she does n’t . Thank you . "
590369	590384	590385	590385	She	9246	" Remember the Pascal sisters ? You tried to convince them you were twins . "
590403	590414	590398	590398	I	884	" There had n't been any point to that game . "
590415	590426	590427	590427	She	9246	" Yes there had been — it was for fun . "
590438	590460	590427	590427	She	9246	" I could never figure out whether you were that good at fooling them or whether they were just that clueless . "
590484	590487	590466	590466	I	884	" brothers . "
590488	590498	590499	590499	I	884	" I think they were relatively easy to fool . "
590504	590514	590499	590499	I	884	" Why would two brothers have two different accents ? "
590515	590528	590466	590466	I	884	" Right ? I do n't think I 've ever laughed harder . "
590529	590538	590539	590539	I	884	" That was fun , was n't it ? "
590653	590663	590664	590664	Alayna	168	" And did the Pascals think it was fun ? "
590685	590695	590681	590681	I	884	" No , I 'm sure they did not . "
590696	590701	590702	590702	Alayna	168	" She 's burped , "
590870	590884	590885	590885	Celia	9246	" Hudson , I forgot to show you that I had this ready , "
590943	590990	591040	591040	She	168	" I hope you find that suitable for Chandler and Genevieve 's engagement party . I tried to be thoughtful about where I placed you . As you can see , I did n't put you in the back , though I did appreciate the suggestion . "
591015	591025	591026	591026	Alayna	168	" Hudson suggested a seating arrangement for the party ? "
591059	591062	591063	591063	Celia	9246	" Yes , "
591074	591107	591063	591063	Celia	9246	" He called me right after they got engaged , concerned about any unnecessary tension between , well , us . He requested that he be allowed to approve the seating arrangement . "
591128	591137	591108	591108	Alayna	168	" You thought I could n't handle it . "
591162	591167	591168	591168	I	884	" Alayna … precious … "
591226	591235	591204	591204	She	168	" Excuse me . I have to go . "
591236	591242	591243	591243	I	884	" Give us a minute , "
591321	591339	591308	591308	Alayna	168	" This is n't what it looks like . You ca n't let this get to you . "
591340	591345	591346	591346	she	168	" Ca n't I ? "
591350	591366	591346	591346	she	168	" Is n't that exactly what you expected I would do in Celia 's presence ? "
591373	591400	591370	591370	my	884	" Oh , for Pete 's sake . That is n't fair . You were obsessing . I was trying to make it better for you . "
591401	591415	591416	591416	Her	168	" Awesome . Seems to be working really well , does n't it ? "
591433	591436	591437	591437	I	884	" Look , "
591441	591458	591437	591437	I	884	" I understand . It 's tense in there . It 's difficult to trust Celia — "
591464	591513	591459	591459	She	168	" This has nothing to do with Celia right now , Hudson . Do n't you get it ? This is so classic . You do n't even see how you manipulate people . You 're the one making me crazy ! Look at yourself in the mirror . ”
591532	591555	591521	591521	My	884	“ You ’ve overdramatizing this . As usual . This is why I did n’t want you working on this with me . ”
591556	591591	591598	591598	she	7749	“ That ’s bullshit . That ’s an excuse so that you do n’t have to face the fact that you broke my trust — not in the past , Hudson , but now . ”
591638	591651	591634	591634	I	884	“ I am not going to take responsibility for your overactive mind . ”
591722	591754	591694	591694	She	7749	“ Typical . Not taking responsibility . Have you stopped to think for a second that might be exactly why we ’re in the predicament we ’re in at the moment ? ”
591806	591848	591801	591801	I	884	“ That ’s enough . Go home . Better yet , go to work . You need something to keep your mind busy while I try to save our family . Why do n’t you go fixate on The Sky Launch ? ”
591904	591948	591949	591949	Gwen	816	" ... and the woman raised her arms above her head , her wrists bound together , remember . Then she dropped them really fast and , like , sort of shot her elbows to the side , and broke through the binding . "
591959	591979	591949	591949	Gwen	816	" There was , probably three layers of duct tape around her wrists too . It was freaking amazing . "
592000	592010	591986	591986	Liesl	166	" No way . Nothing breaks through that stuff . "
592011	592014	592015	592015	Gwen	816	" Way , "
592018	592037	592015	592015	Gwen	816	" It did n't even look like it took any effort . That 's how easy it was . "
592038	592075	591986	591986	Liesl	166	" This changes my vision on everything . I really thought that standard duct tape was the impenetrable fix - all . Maybe I do need to call a handyman about that pipe in my kitchen . "
592526	592529	592530	592530	Liesl	166	" Wait , ”
592538	592557	592530	592530	Liesl	166	“ You said she broke through the binding — was that before or after the guy fucked her ? "
592558	592591	592601	592601	Liesl	166	" Oh , definitely after . They were playing out some sort of attack fantasy . He had tape over her mouth too — you know , so she could n't scream . "
592592	592600	592601	592601	Liesl	166	" Damn . That 's so hot . "
592614	592630	592601	592601	Liesl	166	" It was hot , right ? Or was it too rapey to be hot ? "
592631	592658	592659	592659	Gwen	816	" It was definitely hot . And rapey . Which sounds really bad , when I say it that way . But she asked for it . "
592664	592675	592659	592659	Gwen	816	" That sounds just as bad . It was consensual . "
592676	592680	592681	592681	Liesl	166	" Consensual rape , "
592684	592689	592681	592681	Liesl	166	" I get it . "
592695	592711	592690	592690	I	884	" There is no such thing as consensual rape . It 's called rape play . "
592712	592737	592741	592741	Liesl	166	" Someone ’s sure in a testy mood . Gwen 's talking about the best night of her life over here . Lighten up . "
592743	592763	592738	592738	I	884	" And it seems she thought the highlight of the night was when a woman burst through duct tape . "
592771	592802	592738	592738	I	884	" If that 's really the best thing you got out of the sex party , it was either the lamest sex party on earth or you already know everything . "
592809	592849	592850	592850	She	816	" I do know a lot , thank you . And it was n't the highlight . It 's just the only thing that 's suitable for discussion at work in front of everyone . And it was supercool . "
592853	592865	592850	592850	She	816	" Liesl 's right — you do need to lighten up . "
592878	592902	592866	592866	I	884	" I 'm sorry . I 'm in a bad mood . I did n't mean to take it out on you two . "
592914	592922	592903	592903	Gwen	816	" Understandable . And you are forgiven . "
592937	592960	592932	592932	I	884	" Honestly , I do n't know how we ’re all not in a bad mood . This job fair is insane . "
593066	593069	593070	593070	Liesl	166	" Hey , "
593083	593088	593070	593070	Liesl	166	" Is that David ? "
593094	593107	593108	593108	I	884	" David who ? David Lindt ? Who used to work here ? "
593130	593134	593135	593135	Liesl	166	" It is ! "
593138	593141	593142	593142	she	816	" David , "
593148	593153	593142	593142	she	816	" Hey , David ! "
593472	593475	593478	593478	he	2331	" Laynie , "
593490	593493	593494	593494	I	884	" Hi , "
593654	593660	593661	593661	I	884	" What are you — ? ”
593674	593683	593667	593667	he	180	" I thought you were on maternity leave . "
593684	593688	593689	593689	I	884	" I am . ”
593693	593697	593700	593700	I	884	“ I was . ”
593720	593727	593700	593700	I	884	" I do n't know anymore . "
593773	593784	593766	593766	David	180	" Hudson does n't want you working , or what ? "
593842	593847	593848	593848	I	884	" He … actually ... "
593911	593916	593917	593917	I	884	" It 's complicated , "
593921	593935	593917	593917	I	884	" But what about you ? Are you here for the job fair ? "
593941	593956	593936	593936	He	180	" Can you think of any other reason I would be in a suit ? "
593957	593962	593964	593964	he	180	" What about Adora ? "
593989	593998	593982	593982	David	180	" You do n't know about the closing ? "
594054	594072	594074	594074	they	7794	" I think I heard something about remodeling . Are you saying the club closed for good ? "
594089	594101	594102	594102	David	180	" All I know is I no longer have a job , "
594117	594142	594102	594102	David	180	" Oh my god , Hudson . Did he even consider that people would be out of a job when he decided to remodel ? "
594160	594169	594154	594154	He	180	" You want me to talk to him ? "
594170	594177	594178	594178	David	180	" No , please do n't . "
594195	594240	594178	594178	David	180	" Nightlife there is n't like it is here anyway . It 's a dead zone . Atlantic City is not the place it used to be . I want to get back to the real city . I want my old life back . "
594267	594302	594303	594303	I	884	" I know ! You should come back here ! Do n't you think , Gwen ? It would be perfect to have another experienced manager like David when we get the expansion going . "
594308	594322	594303	594303	I	884	" Would that be weird ? Being back here . Working under me . "
594326	594338	594323	594323	David	180	" I think I quite enjoy working under you , Laynie . "
594413	594421	594422	594422	he	180	" I 'll put in my resume , "
594425	594441	594422	594422	he	180	" But tell me about this expansion . Is The Sky Launch opening another location ? "
594466	594485	594457	594457	I	884	" Let me show you ! I have a PowerPoint presentation upstairs . Do you have the time ? "
594493	594512	594486	594486	He	180	" A PowerPoint presentation . Course you do . And , yeah . I have a little time . "
594513	594519	594520	594520	Gwen	816	" I 'm coming with , "
594566	594582	594553	594553	she	816	" Oh . I 'll stay and keep doing my job . Enjoy your PowerPoint . "
594583	594589	594590	594590	Gwen	816	" Thank you , Liesl , "
594649	594660	594661	594661	David	180	" Hudson still has bodyguards on you , does he ? "
594734	594740	594756	594756	David	180	“ He ’s very protective . ”
595013	595026	595027	595027	he	180	" This is going to knock every other nightclub off the rails , "
595030	595073	595027	595027	he	180	" Eighty - eighth Floor is going to immediately try to copy you . You know that , right ? And I predict at least three other clubs go out of business within six months . No , not three . Five . "
595077	595088	595074	595074	I	884	" Stop it . You are being way too nice . "
595119	595213	595114	595114	He	180	" I 'm not kidding . I know you already increased business tenfold when you went to seven days a week . Adding the restaurant and the advance rentals for private , high - end events , was a game changer . There are n't any other clubs in town that even have the equity to do what you 're thinking of doing , and by the time they catch up , you ’re already on to the next thing . Thumbs up , Laynie . You done good . Proud of you . "
595285	595289	595280	595280	I	884	" Thank you . "
595290	595298	595299	595299	Gwen	816	" Oh , speaking of the expansion , "
595327	595381	595313	595313	She	816	" Lee Chong dropped this off so you can go over there any time and do measurements and whatnot for whatever you need to do architecturally . It opens the door in the stairwell that connects to ours . So you do n't even have to go outside and around to get in . "
595403	595413	595414	595414	I	884	" I know what I 'm doing this afternoon , "
595423	595439	595414	595414	I	884	" After I finish helping you clean up from the job fair , that is . "
595474	595487	595488	595488	David	180	" Is it really that late ? I need to get going . "
595696	595708	595709	595709	Gwen	816	" Laynie , you ca n't hire him , you know , "
595754	595790	595791	595791	Gwen	816	" Why not ? I know Hudson transferred him in the first place because he was jealous , but that was before we were married . Surely he understands he 's got the girl now . "
595794	595824	595791	595791	Gwen	816	" You seriously do n't know ? David was fired from Adora because of the sexual harassment scandal . The whole remodel thing is a total cover - up . "
595832	595839	595826	595826	I	884	" How do you know that ? "
595867	595872	595861	595861	Gwen	816	" Chandler told me . "
595873	595878	595861	595861	Gwen	816	" Oh my god . "
595907	595912	595913	595913	I	884	" Oh my god , "
595922	595930	595931	595931	I	884	" And Hudson did n't tell me ? "
595947	595969	595943	595945	A particular someone	7819	" Jesus Christ , I ca n't even believe him . Was he afraid that was going to break me too ? "
595986	595996	595997	595997	Gwen	816	" That really sucks he did n't tell you … "
596001	596015	595997	595997	Gwen	816	" You do n't have any reaction to the harassment accusation , though ? "
596054	596066	596067	596067	I	884	" You know what I kept thinking while David was here ? ”
596075	596110	596111	596111	I	884	“ Why ca n't Hudson 's people from the past be as easy to deal with as the people from mine ? That was a real naïve thing to be thinking , I guess . "
596138	596181	596182	596182	I	884	" I assume that if Pierce Industries went to this much trouble to fire David and come up with a remodeling cover - up , then they have received verifiable complaints from employees , and that it 's not just some rumors . "
596213	596261	596189	596189	She	816	" I do n’t know all the specifics , but I know it was several women that filed the complaints . It was n't against just David — there were several managers involved in the accusations . Now , I do n't know how credible they are … "
596269	596281	596282	596282	I	884	" If a woman feels harassed , she 's been harassed . "
596286	596294	596282	596282	I	884	" Poor Hudson . What a mess . ”
596382	596417	596418	596418	She	1858	" David was often inappropriate . He was my boss , and he and I engaged in the exchange of sexual favors on the premises . During business hours . And I encouraged it . "
596423	596433	596418	596418	She	1858	" That sounds like you making excuses for him . "
596434	596491	596418	596418	She	1858	" I ’m not . I 'm not defending him at all . I 'm just owning my part of what happened between us . He would make jokes in poor taste . I laughed at them because I thought they were his way of flirting , and I wanted him to be flirting with me . "
596521	596542	596418	596418	She	1858	" I do n't know what he would have done if I had n't returned his advances like I did . "
596598	596606	596607	596607	Gwen	816	" Did you like him , then ? "
596612	596623	596607	596607	Gwen	816	" When I met you , you definitely did n't . "
596624	596667	596668	596668	She	816	" I thought I should like him . If that makes sense . I was looking for a guy that I was n't really into . I was too afraid if I was into someone , I 'd get crazy over him . "
596671	596680	596668	596668	She	816	" How did that work out for you ? "
596690	596697	596681	596681	I	884	" Hudson definitely makes me crazy . "
597084	597091	597075	597075	I	884	" Oh , it 's you . "
597864	597868	597869	597869	Payton	608	" Mr. Pierce , "
597914	597925	597926	597926	I	884	" Yes , Payton . You want to go home . "
597951	598006	598007	598007	She	9246	" I 'm sorry . Do you mind staying for another couple of hours or so ? I may need to run out , and I have n't managed to get a hold of Alayna to see when she 'll be home . I ’ll pay you time and a half for the inconvenience . "
598010	598041	598007	598007	She	9246	" No problem . Can I grab something off of Mrs. Pierce 's shelves to read again ? I finished Madame Bovary and I ’m having a total book hangover . "
598042	598045	598046	598046	I	884	" Certainly , "
598060	598081	598046	598046	I	884	" Oh , and of course I do n't mind if you turn on Netflix in the guest room either . "
598107	598113	598114	598114	she	9246	" Thanks , Mr. Pierce , "
598283	598301	598279	598279	she	9246	“ My employees need to see me as a boss , not as someone ’s little lady . ”
598458	598489	598430	598430	she	9246	" Hello , this is Hudson Pierce . I 'm looking for my wife . She 's not answering her phone , and I wanted to check in on her . "
598490	598496	598430	598430	she	9246	" Oh , how sweet . "
598532	598539	598540	598540	Penny	286	" But she is n’t here , "
598553	598572	598546	598546	She	9246	" Can you tell me what time she left ? So I can know when to expect her . "
598573	598594	598540	598540	Penny	286	" I have n't seen her all night . And my shift started at six . Perhaps you ’re incorrect ? "
598603	598623	598624	598624	My	884	" No , Penny , she was there . You 're sure you have n’t seen her at all ? "
598639	598644	598645	598645	Penny	286	" I 'm sure , "
598650	598665	598645	598645	Penny	286	" Would you like me to take a message in case she shows up ? "
598666	598672	598673	598673	I	884	" No . Thank you . "
598773	598778	598779	598779	I	884	" Where are you ? "
598786	598832	598852	598852	she	168	" Same place I 've been all day , Mr. Pierce . Sitting in one of those weird circle rooms at the club . Your wife , I must say , is a workaholic . She has n't left the manager ’s office all afternoon . "
598864	598895	598852	598852	she	168	" Do me a favor , Dawes — go up there and check , can you ? I called the office directly , and was told she was n't there . "
598896	598945	598852	598852	she	168	" Sure thing , boss . But I 'm telling you , I 've had my eyes on that stairway door all day , and she has n't come down . I have n’t even gone to the bathroom . There ’s no way she snuck by me . "
598954	598962	598963	598963	I	884	" Then she 'll be up there , "
598972	598986	598963	598963	I	884	" And when you find her , make sure she calls me immediately . "
599123	599201	599202	599202	He	7873	" I swear she did n't leave . Her things are still in the office , and even if she decided to go out of the fire well , we have a guy watching the door outside , and he has n't seen her either . He has n’t left his station even once , he said . You can have Jordan verify , we all stay logged into this GPS app on our smart - watches ... "
599243	599254	599255	599255	I	884	" Obviously one of you fell asleep on the job , "
599258	599266	599255	599255	I	884	" Who was she working with last ? "
599267	599274	599321	599321	Gwen	816	" Gwen Bruzzo . The blonde . "
599285	599314	599277	599277	Dawes	633	" Keep looking for her . If you 're so goddamned sure she did n't slip out , than she ’s got to be somewhere in the building . "
599323	599339	599255	599255	I	884	“ Alayna has n't come home , and I ca n’t get ahold of her . "
599340	599349	599350	599350	She	7874	" And you 've tried The Sky Launch ? "
599365	599417	599418	599418	I	884	" Of course I tried the club first . Her things are still there , but she 's not . You know she goes nowhere without her phone , in case something happens with the kids . Was she there when you left ? Did she say anything about going anywhere ? "
599451	599454	599455	599455	Gwen	816	" Oh ! "
599458	599514	599455	599455	Gwen	816	" Lee Chong gave her a key to next door ! She went over there to measure and visualize and scope out the space again . She was still there when I left . I 'm sure that 's where she is now . Probably lost track of time . You know how she gets . "
599527	599550	599595	599595	she	7875	" Yes . I 'm sure you 're right . I do know how she gets . Thank you for telling me . "
600320	600323	600324	600324	My	884	" Alayna ? "
600662	600665	600666	600666	I	884	" Fuck ! "
600687	600694	600666	600666	I	884	" Fuck , fuck , fuck ! "
600787	600797	600798	600798	Jordan	7091	" When you did n't respond to my text , "
600801	600837	600798	600798	Jordan	7091	" I contacted Dawes to see what was going on with Alayna . He filled me in . We are currently looking at that stairwell to see if she somehow slipped out without us noticing . "
601070	601073	601074	601074	I	884	" Anything ? "
601092	601138	601085	601085	Jordan	7091	" We are n't having any real success . It ’s damn near impossible to collect data with this many people — looking at the cameras and matching ID records . If it were a normal business day , this would be a different story . "
601139	601150	601151	601151	I	884	" What do you mean , a normal business day ? "
601155	601165	601166	601166	he	7091	" The job fair . The place was chaotic . "
601169	601173	601174	601174	Penny	286	" Record attendance , "
601193	601205	601174	601174	Penny	286	“ Quite a coup . All our hard work paid off . ”
601206	601218	601219	601219	I	884	" Who the fuck authorized a job fair on the premises ? "
601255	601264	601174	601174	Penny	286	" Alayna did , sir . Months ago . "
601265	601279	601280	601280	Jordan	7091	" We talked about it last week , or the security team did , "
601283	601307	601280	601280	Jordan	7091	" She had n't planned to be in attendance , so we did n't make any adjustments to how to handle the day . "
601418	601428	601429	601429	He	7091	" When do you want to call the police ? "
601576	601580	601581	601581	I	884	" Not yet , "
601592	601654	601581	601581	I	884	" They wo n't let me help . This whole thing is about me . This is personal . Whoever did this wants to hurt me for something I did in the past . I ’ll figure it out faster without being babysat by some smug detective who will just want to ask questions like whether she was having an affair . "
601725	601786	601787	601787	Jordan	7091	" I 'm going to get my man on these tapes then , an expert in tech who can maybe give us a fuller picture of what ’s happening than we can see . We ’ll do fingerprints on those shot glasses and a full sweep of the event space , check out where our prime suspects were this afternoon . "
601801	601815	601816	601816	I	884	" Okay . Alright . That 's good . That 's all good . "
601837	601857	601858	601858	I	884	" I 'm going to go work on this from my end . Text me when you find something . "
602014	602018	602019	602019	I	884	" Find her , "
602026	602031	602019	602019	I	884	" Find my wife . "
602132	602141	602142	602142	David	180	“ Here , you can puke in this , ”
602398	602405	602406	602406	I	884	“ Oh , it ’s you , ”
602435	602442	602421	602421	Hudson	168	“ I thought you ’d left . ”
602456	602465	602466	602466	he	180	“ I got caught downstairs with old faces , ”
602470	602490	602466	602466	he	180	“ I thought we should toast to all your success before I left . For old times ’ sake . ”
602779	602788	602789	602789	he	180	“ You ’re coming out of it now , ”
602847	602857	602841	602841	he	180	“ Here . Drink this . It will help . ”
602898	602904	602858	602858	I	884	“ You gave me something . ”
602905	602927	602875	602875	my	884	“ Sorry . It was necessary . You would n’t have come otherwise . You ’re too far under his spell . ”
603099	603115	603116	603116	My	884	“ What are you talking about ? What did you do ? Where are we ? ”
603140	603147	603134	603134	He	180	“ We ’re home , Laynie . ”
603186	603279	603291	603291	David	180	“ I bought this place for you . I know it ’s not as fancy as the places you ’re used to , but we ’ll make it ours . I did n’t have time to prepare it properly . I was n’t expecting to bring you here so soon . But then I saw you yesterday , and when you said you were going next door , away from his prison guards , I had to take the opportunity . I did n’t know if I ’d get the chance again . ”
603393	603400	603377	603377	I	884	“ What did you give me ? ”
603415	603418	603401	603401	He	180	“ Rohyphnol . ”
603438	603447	603432	603432	He	180	“ Did we … ? Did you … ? ”
603477	603482	603483	603483	He	180	“ No , no ! ”
603487	603502	603483	603483	He	180	“ Of course not . I would n’t do that to you , Laynie . ”
603513	603526	603503	603503	He	180	“ I want you to remember it when we ’re finally together . ”
603630	603668	603673	603673	his	180	“ Calm down . Do n’t fight me . I ’m just cleaning you up right now , baby . I know you ’re confused and disoriented , but trust me — I’m trying to help you . ”
603835	603854	603824	603824	I	884	“ Thank you . For helping me . But we ’re not going to be together , David . ”
603868	603888	603824	603824	I	884	“ I ’m with Hudson . I ’m married to Hudson . Hudson is going to want me back . ”
603889	603892	603893	603893	David	180	“ Shh , ”
603958	603998	603945	603945	I	884	“ David , this is serious . You ca n’t do this . You have to take me back to my family . The police will come looking for me . Hudson is going to come looking for me . ”
604019	604064	603999	603999	David	180	“ Laynie , we can talk if you feel up to it , but not about Hudson . He ’s got you confused . He does that — he tricks people . He ’s tricked you into thinking you ’re in love with him . ”
604065	604073	604074	604074	I	884	“ I am in love with him , ”
604129	604147	604148	604148	he	180	“ I did n’t want to use this , but I knew you might not be cooperative , ”
604158	604238	604148	604148	he	180	“ It ’s the spell he has on you . Like I said , you only think you ’re in love with him . It ’s going to take time to get over that , I know , and it might even hurt a little going through the process , but I ’ll be here to help you through it . And when we ’ve broken his spell , we ’ll be able to really start our life together . ”
604354	604539	604345	604345	He	7954	“ I hope you can forgive me for leaving you with him for so long , Laynie . He tricked me too . He made me believe you loved him , like he made you believe it . But then I found out about the tricks he played on people , and I finally got it . It never made sense why you chose him — you were n’t into his type before . He was n’t right for you . You ’re too strong and beautiful to be with someone like that , someone who put you in the shadows . As soon as I realized what he ’d done to you , I started working on a plan to get you out of there . It took a long time because I had to get it right . He ’s smart . I had to make sure I threw the blame in other places so he would n’t know it was me who saved you . That way he ca n’t find us because he ’ll be looking in the wrong place . ”
604555	604561	604562	604562	I	884	“ You sent the letters , ”
604592	604596	604597	604597	he	884	“ I did ! ”
604601	604609	604597	604597	he	884	“ You never guessed , did you ? ”
604640	604644	604626	604626	He	884	“ Did you ? ”
604645	604648	604649	604649	I	884	“ No , ”
604669	604678	604657	604657	He	884	“ I did n’t guess it was you . ”
604738	604756	604757	604757	He	6778	“ I was good . I was patient . I wanted to do it right for you . ”
604860	604867	604868	604868	he	180	“ Say thank you , Laynie , ”
604880	604885	604886	604886	he	180	“ Say thank you ! ”
604896	604900	604901	604901	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
604905	604922	604923	604923	he	180	“ Good girl . Such a good girl . You were always such a good girl , ”
605019	605037	605007	605007	he	180	“ What ’s wrong , honey ? Is it your stomach still ? Does your head hurt ? ”
605038	605042	605043	605043	I	884	“ My babies , ”
605061	605071	605054	605054	my	884	“ My babies , David . I have babies . ”
605072	605108	605043	605043	I	884	“ Oh , no , no . I was never going to hurt them . I only said that to confuse Hudson . And to scare him . I ’m sorry it scared you too . ”
605125	605141	605109	605109	I	884	“ I ca n’t leave them . They need me . They need their mother . ”
605153	605158	605159	605159	he	180	“ Oh , baby , ”
605169	605264	605159	605159	he	180	“ I ’m so sorry for that . I wish we could take them with us because I know it would make you feel better , but ... they ’re his kids too . Even if I thought we could somehow get them away from him , which I do n’t believe we can — you know how tight a hold he keeps on his possessions — we ca n’t have any part of him with us . I ca n’t allow that . He ’s too toxic . Even his DNA is toxic . ”
605379	605434	605372	605372	I	884	“ I know it hurts to be without your children at this moment . But we ’re together now . You ’ll get over them . We just have to get them out of your system . We have to get Hudson out of your system , like the rohyphnol . It needs time . ”
605449	605458	605459	605459	he	180	“ But I ’m going to help you , ”
605462	605477	605478	605478	He	180	“ Every step of the way . I ’ll help you forget about him . ”
605503	605519	605478	605478	He	180	“ Oh , Laynie . I ’ve waited so long to be with you again . ”
605716	605725	605726	605726	he	180	“ I ’ve missed your mouth so much , ”
605736	605780	605726	605726	he	180	“ I ’ve never forgotten what it feels like to have your mouth on me . You were so good at taking my cock all the way down your throat . It ’s going to feel so good when you do that again . ”
605781	605790	605791	605791	I	884	“ I ca n’t ! I ca n’t ! ”
605850	605858	605859	605859	I	884	“ Ow ! You ’re hurting me ! ”
605895	605967	605879	605879	He	180	“ He ’s convinced you you ’re a princess now Alayna , has n’t he ? That you ’re too good for sucking cock ? Well , you ’re not . Do you hear me ? You ’re still Laynie from the bar . You ’re not too good for having it down your throat or in any other hole I think you should take it in , you got that ? ”
606023	606034	606035	606035	I	884	“ I get it . I do . I understand . ”
606053	606065	606066	606066	I	884	“ I did n’t mean that I was too good for … ”
606072	606076	606077	606077	I	884	“ I meant … ”
606081	606116	606077	606077	I	884	“ I ’m too sick . The drug is still in my system , like you said . And I want to be completely well when we ’re … when we ’re ... together . ”
606136	606143	606144	606144	He	7959	“ My good , good Laynie . ”
606158	606184	606144	606144	He	7959	“ I ’m so happy to hear this is as important to you as it is to me . You ’re already getting over Hudson . ”
606314	606317	606318	606318	I	884	“ David , ”
606328	606385	606386	606386	I	884	“ David , it is important to me . Us being together . I did n’t realize you ’d worked so hard for me . I want to make it special . I want to ... clean up for you . Get pretty . Um . Shave . And ... uh … do my hair up . ”
606414	606434	606408	606408	His	180	“ Do n’t you know ? You do n’t need to do any of that for me , Laynie . ”
606458	606490	606445	606445	I	884	“ But I need to ! I need to wash Hudson from my body . Like you said . He ’s toxic . I need to get him off my skin . ”
606540	606543	606544	606544	he	180	“ Okay , ”
606628	606650	606624	606624	he	180	“ Okay . Washing Hudson off of you . That ’s smart . That ’s just like you . Always thinking . ”
606697	606715	606690	606690	David	180	“ I do n’t have much here . I did n’t have time to prepare for you . ”
606721	606755	606756	606756	I	884	“ I know ! You had to take me when you could . That ’s fine . But maybe we could go to the store . Just to pick up a few things . ”
606774	606804	606763	606763	He	180	“ I wish we could , Laynie . You ca n’t go anywhere though . Not in public . People are going to be looking for you . Remember ? ”
606805	606817	606818	606818	He	180	“ I ’ll be careful . I could wear a disguise . ”
606825	606864	606818	606818	He	180	“ Did you drive far enough from the city ? We have to be in the middle of nowhere , right ? No one is going to pay attention to the news out here . Not city news . ”
606873	606876	606818	606818	He	180	“ Laynie , ”
606883	606948	606818	606818	He	180	“ Something you need to learn now is that when I say no , you do n’t argue with me . That ’s another bad habit you ’ve gotten into . Hudson must have let you walk all over him . With me , though , I ’m the boss , and I do n’t want to remind you of that over and over . ”
606949	606952	606953	606953	I	884	“ Okay , ”
606959	606964	606965	606965	I	884	“ I ’m sorry , ”
606977	607013	606818	606818	He	180	“ It ’s all right . This time . It ’s only your first day back with me , and you ’ve been gone a long time . I understand you ’re a bit disoriented . ”
607027	607040	607022	607022	I	884	“ Then can you go ? I could give you a list . ”
607058	607067	607056	607056	me	884	“ I could type it into your phone ! ”
607072	607109	607068	607068	He	168	“ You know I ca n’t give you my phone , sweetheart . There ’s no signal up here , anyway . But I can get you a pen and paper . I do have that . ”
607284	607295	607296	607296	he	180	“ It ’s a bit of a trip to town , ”
607305	607318	607296	607296	he	180	“ Will you be okay without me ? Being sick and all ? ”
607335	607371	607326	607326	I	884	“ Yes . I ’m a bit better now . Thinking about us being together has me feeling better . All I need is some food , I think . It should settle my stomach . ”
607372	607377	607378	607378	He	180	“ That ’s fantastic . ”
607390	607413	607378	607378	He	180	“ I ’m going to have to be with you tonight , and I want you to be able to enjoy it . ”
607698	607701	607702	607702	he	180	“ Laynie , ”
607705	607721	607702	607702	he	180	“ You ’re being naughty . I ca n’t buy everything you ’ve asked for . ”
607722	607730	607731	607731	I	884	“ That ’s okay . I just … ”
607744	607752	607753	607753	he	180	“ I ca n’t buy the condoms , ”
607763	607766	607756	607756	My	884	“ What ? ”
607783	607795	607796	607796	he	180	“ I ’ve waited too too long to be with you , ”
607811	607842	607796	607796	he	180	“ I need to feel you bare . There ca n’t be anything between us anymore . And how will we start our family if I ’m wearing a rubber ? ”
607843	607848	607849	607849	I	884	“ I … I … ”
607917	607955	607912	607912	I	884	“ I was thinking about protecting you . From Hudson . He ’s been inside me . He ’s left all that … that toxin inside me . I do n’t want to share that with you . ”
607965	608006	607956	607956	His	180	“ So smart . I ’m sure it wo n’t take very long before he ’s out of you . Maybe with your period . It will clean you all out . When are you due for your next one ? ”
608007	608012	607912	607912	I	884	“ In another week . ”
608016	608049	608013	608013	He	180	“ I ’ll add maxipads to the list . I know you might like tampons instead , but from now on nothing goes in your cunt unless I put it in there . ”
608125	608150	608109	608109	he	180	“ We ’re going to have so much fun together , Laynie . So much fun . I ca n’t wait to show you . ”
608275	608293	608294	608294	His	180	“ That needs to come off . He gave it to you . It needs to go . ”
608311	608321	608322	608322	I	884	“ I ’m so used to it , though , ”
608330	608347	608322	608322	I	884	“ I like the feel of it . We can pretend you gave it to me . ”
608348	608370	608322	608322	I	884	“ I ’ll get you a ring . That one needs to go , baby , so you can move on . ”
608393	608398	608399	608399	I	884	“ No . Please . ”
608569	608578	608579	608579	he	180	“ He still has that hold on you , ”
608582	608592	608579	608579	he	180	“ I knew it would n’t be that easy . ”
608617	608627	608628	608628	I	884	“ He does n’t have a hold on me ! ”
608635	608679	608628	608628	I	884	“ I want to be with you ! If you get those things for me , I ’ll be able to show you how much I appreciate you . And ... and … want you . I ’m not thinking straight right now . ”
608775	608852	608763	608763	He	180	“ I ’m still going to the store . You do need to clean yourself up before we ’re together . I want you fresh and pure when I make love to you so I ’m going to get the things you need to do that . I ’ll give you another chance to take off that ring when I get back . If you do n’t do it willingly , I ’ll cut it off . ”
608862	608874	608853	608853	He	180	“ I also think you might be trying to trick me . ”
608880	608890	608875	608875	I	884	“ No , I ’m not ! I swear . ”
608908	608980	608981	608981	He	180	“ I ’ve decided it ’s okay if you are . I know it ’s going to take some time before you realize what Hudson has done to you . I know how you can get obsessed with someone . It ’s what you do . He used that against you , it was n’t your fault . But you ’ll get over him . And , when you finally do … ”
608991	609025	608981	608981	He	180	“ I ’ll be able to leave you here without having to do this , but for now , I ’m going to have to make it so you ca n’t run away . ”
609100	609123	609125	609125	he	180	“ Please , no ! I ’ll be good ! I ’ll take off the rings ! Leave me loose ! Please ! ”
609375	609379	609360	609360	Edward	545	" Any luck ? "
609395	609398	609399	609399	She	9246	" No . ”
609423	609433	609434	609434	he	545	" Please make sure you get some rest today , ”
609439	609450	609434	609434	he	545	“ Let Elsa take one of the feedings for you . "
609467	609491	609492	609492	I	884	" I apologize , Edward , for keeping her up all night . I know how precious sleep is with a little one . "
609560	609583	609549	609550	Edward Fasbender	545	" No apology needed . It 's understandable . At times we have to push the limits for the ones we love . "
609584	609589	609549	609550	Edward Fasbender	545	" Yes . That . "
609619	609631	609632	609632	he	545	" I wish you the best of luck in your search , "
609649	609663	609645	609645	Celia	638	" Hudson … Maybe it 's not here . Maybe this is n't — "
609688	609695	609696	609696	I	884	" Read me the letters again , "
609779	609784	609785	609785	I	884	" Wait a minute , "
609796	609806	609785	609785	I	884	" Read the line again about playing at marriage . "
609825	609852	609853	609853	Celia	638	" ’ You played at marriage and think that makes you a husband . ’ He sounds skeptical of your marriage , if you ask me , "
609856	609883	609853	609853	Celia	638	" What kind of person would say that ? Who would care that much about your marriage ? Somebody 's else ’s marriage that we ruined ? "
609884	609897	609817	609817	her	9246	" No . Someone who does n't think I deserve my marriage . "
609923	609940	609817	609817	her	9246	" Is that a reference to the time that you and I pretended to be married ? "
609954	609991	609941	609941	She	9246	" I suppose it could be . Though it would be strange if someone would want to get revenge for that scheme . I do n’t think that other couple ever realized they were being played . "
610018	610047	609941	609941	She	9246	" Where is that account recorded ? It 's not in any of the journals that we 've read . Did you leave one out for some reason ? "
610059	610098	609941	609941	She	9246	" And what about the mask reference — you said it might be referring to the masquerade party , but I do n't remember reading about that in any of these journals either . Where are those stories ? "
610116	610131	610132	610132	My	884	" Is there a journal missing ? Is there one that 's not here ? "
610160	610179	610180	610180	She	9246	" I forgot all about it . I 'm sorry ! Please do n't be mad at me . "
610203	610233	610234	610234	She	9246	" Years ago … when I was trying to … when I was sure that Alayna would n't want you if she knew about the games of your past … "
610284	610292	610282	610282	her	9246	" What did you do , Celia ? "
610293	610338	610380	610380	I	884	" I took one of the journals and planted it in the bookcase in the manager 's office at The Sky Launch . I thought that if Alayna found it , she would understand who you were by reading it . That she 'd — "
610339	610370	610371	610371	I	884	" That she 'd read the horrible and terrible things we 'd done together and leave me right away . I 'm getting the picture . Fuck you , Celia . "
610443	610451	610452	610452	I	884	" Well , she never found it , "
610465	610487	610459	610459	I	884	" and she loves me anyway , that crazy woman . What we ’re missing has to be in that volume . "
610504	610526	610488	610488	I	884	" I guess we ’re done here , then . Thank you very much for helping me with all of this . "
610527	610546	610547	610547	She	7991	" Oh , do n't you dare pull me into this and then dismiss me at your will . "
610556	610581	610547	610547	She	7991	" Give me five minutes to put on some clothes and tell Elsa that I 'm leaving , and I 'll come with you . "
610695	610715	610716	610716	She	7991	" There used to be a bookcase in here . I stuck it in with all the other books . "
610722	610733	610716	610716	She	7991	" This is all different since I was last here . "
610734	610746	610681	610681	she	7991	" It was fully remodeled when Alayna was on maternity leave . "
610767	610805	610806	610806	Celia	638	" You left the journal for Alayna to find , but how did you expect her to know that it was me and you it was talking about ? All the references to me just say him . "
610830	610845	610846	610846	She	7991	" I put a picture of us from the masquerade ball it described inside . "
610871	610892	610893	610893	I	884	" Then anyone , really , who had their hands on the journal would have realized who the stories involved . "
610908	610927	610901	610901	Gwen	816	" The person who has Alayna was n't a victim from our past — he read our past . "
610946	610982	610932	610932	I	884	" I 'm sorry it 's early , I have a question that could be important . When you remodeled , where did all the books go that were on the shelves behind the desk ? "
611021	611044	611045	611045	She	816	" Um , the books were , well … Some of them we threw away . Some I think we probably donated . "
611052	611085	611045	611045	She	816	" A lot of it was David ’s stuff . Alayna had me call him to collect , and he came and picked up the box right before we did the remodel . "
611091	611104	611086	611086	My	884	" That 's exactly what I needed to know . Thank you . "
611113	611142	611110	611110	she	816	" Oh , and I do n't know if this is important , but David was at the club yesterday . He came in for the job fair . "
611167	611177	611110	611110	she	816	" And he was still here when you left ? "
611178	611221	611150	611150	she	816	" No . He left a couple of hours before I did . He stopped and said hi . Alayna invited him up to the office , and we all talked for a while , old - times chat and all that . "
611222	611230	611231	611231	I	884	" Did you actually see him leave ? "
611263	611269	611259	611259	I	884	" It 's David Lindt . ”
611360	611364	611365	611365	she	816	“ Good luck , ”
611425	611429	611430	611430	I	884	“ Thank you , ”
611575	611583	611584	611584	she	816	“ I ’m glad I could help , ”
611603	611620	611595	611595	she	816	“ Hudson , I mean that . Whatever else happens , know that I mean that . ”
611700	611704	611705	611705	I	884	“ All right . ”
611752	611762	611763	611763	Jordan	7091	“ He gave up his apartment in Atlantic City , ”
611774	611852	611763	611763	Jordan	7091	“ His forwarding address on file there led us to an extended stay here in the city . The front desk said he checked out over the phone last night . He still had items in the room that he asked to be kept and he ’d return to pick them up at a later date . No forwarding information . I ’ve sent a man to collect those items , and he should be back here shortly .
611853	611952	611763	611763	Jordan	7091	“ Gwen Bruzzo ’s account of seeing him at The Sky Launch has been corroborated with the video footage . We were able to spot him arriving at fourteen twenty - seven hours . He can be seen on footage for the next couple hours in the club , but he disappears around seventeen hundred hours after purchasing tequila shots at the bar . He paid cash . This is the same time Alayna left the floor , presumably to look at the space next door . We believe he followed her into the stairwell , unbeknownst to her .
611953	612026	611763	611763	Jordan	7091	“ We ’re unable to see that because the camera angled to record that area was taken offline in the previous hour . I believe he must have used the time between leaving the manager ’s office and following Alayna upstairs to disable that camera . It ’s not an easy task , but considering he ’s worked at two Pierce clubs , he would be familiar with the software we use . ”
612027	612043	612044	612044	I	884	“ We should have had a completely new security system put in when he left , ”
612047	612057	612058	612058	Jordan	7091	“ And again when any manager leaves the club ? ”
612062	612096	612058	612058	Jordan	7091	“ Not realistic and not something you need to get hung up on now . Concentrate on the task at hand , not the past . We can Monday morning quarterback later on . ”
612119	612130	612131	612131	Jordan	7091	“ Though he was n’t seen again inside the club , ”
612135	612153	612131	612131	Jordan	7091	“ there is footage of his car driving past the club a little before eighteen hundred hours . ”
612208	612214	612215	612215	I	884	“ She looks ... unconscious , ”
612273	612280	612281	612281	Jordan	7091	“ He ’s likely drugged her , ”
612289	612307	612281	612281	Jordan	7091	“ The testing we did on those shot glasses have traces of Rohypnol in one of them . ”
612370	612379	612380	612380	Jordan	7091	“ I have a friend at the FBI , ”
612394	612428	612387	612387	he	180	“ I ’ve called and asked him to put an APB out on Lindt . My friend ’s giving us five hours before he adds the case into the system as a courtesy . ”
612486	612497	612498	612498	I	884	“ What about credit cards ? Are you tracing those ? ”
612507	612516	612517	612521	a woman on the team	1124	“ I have something on that right now , ”
612534	612571	612517	612521	a woman on the team	1124	“ I ’ve hacked into Lindt ’s bank account and found an unusual transaction within the last month . Here , an amount of forty - eight thousand dollars was transferred out of his savings account . ”
612572	612585	612586	612586	I	884	“ Where the hell did Lindt get forty - eight thousand dollars ? ”
612589	612623	612624	612625	the woman	1124	“ That part ’s easy , he rarely spends money on non - essentials . My bank statements are filled with charges to different retailers , but his are nearly all simple bills , ”
612628	612657	612624	612625	the woman	1124	“ The interesting thing is n’t that he had the money , it ’s that it ’s all of a sudden leaving his account in a lump sum . ”
612658	612668	612669	612669	Jordan	7091	“ Any idea where the money was transferred to ? ”
612672	612687	612688	612688	she	1124	“ It looks like it was deposited directly into another account . Right here , ”
612699	612709	612710	612710	Jordan	7091	“ I ’ll go over to interview her personally , ”
612713	612727	612710	612710	Jordan	7091	“ This transaction may give us a lead on where to look next . ”
612728	612735	612736	612736	I	884	“ I ’ll go with you , ”
612755	612777	612739	612739	I	884	“ I ’m going to want to hear from her own mouth how Judith Cleary is involved in all of this . ”
612847	612912	612843	612843	she	215	" Hudson Pierce . I expected to see you at some point , but I must admit I did n't think it was going to be on my doorstep . If you 'd like to discuss your daughter ’s entrance to my school , you can make an appointment through the office . Though admissions have been finalized for next school year , so — "
612929	612946	612913	612913	I	884	" I 'm not here about Mina . I do n't care about your little school . "
612964	612975	612956	612956	she	215	" I 'm here to discuss something far more urgent . "
612982	612985	612976	612976	I	884	“ Well ? ”
613032	613083	613022	613022	she	215	" Very well . Because I 'm dying to know what 's so urgent that you would need to speak to me face to face . At my home . But make it quick — I have to be at a showing in an hour and it ’s across town . "
613127	613172	613090	613090	she	215	" I need to know about this transaction from a David Lindt in the amount of forty - eight thousand dollars that ended up in your account . Can you tell me why that transaction was made ? What he was paying you for ? "
613173	613195	613196	613196	She	215	" Oh , that 's your angle . You 're trying to find something to blackmail me on , bribe me ? "
613208	613241	613196	613196	She	215	" Well , I can assure you that entire transaction was above board . Trying to use that information to get your daughter into the New Park School is not going to — "
613242	613256	613257	613257	I	884	" I told you , I am not interested in your fucking school . "
613262	613325	613257	613257	I	884	" As soon as I learned you had anything to do with that foundation , I wanted to run a thousand miles away . I 'm not putting my child into a place run by a board of bitches who use their elected positions to settle petty grievances . Now tell me why the fuck you accepted the payment from David Lindt ! "
613337	613348	613349	613349	she	8030	" How dare you speak to me in that way ! "
613353	613367	613349	613349	she	8030	" You can leave now , Mr. Pierce . This conversation is concluded . "
613368	613375	613326	613326	She	8030	" I am not leaving until — "
613376	613382	613383	613383	She	8030	" I will call security ! "
613633	613637	613638	613638	I	884	" I apologize , "
613648	613667	613638	613638	I	884	" I spoke rudely and inappropriately . I 'm desperate , you see . My wife is missing . "
613686	613711	613676	613676	she	215	" Oh my God , Hudson , I am so sorry . But I do n't understand what this has to do with me . "
613712	613755	613676	613676	she	215	" We believe she 's been taken by David Lindt . He ’s a former employee who has been infatuated with her in the past . He was the last one to see her , but now we ca n’t find him . "
613768	613804	613756	613756	I	884	" You have to know that you are the last person that I would ask a favor of . But right now this transaction from his account to yours is the only lead we have . "
613805	613852	613676	613676	she	215	" I see . In that case , and I 'm still not sure why you 're here instead of a police officer , but okay . She ’s a very rude woman herself , but her blood ’s not going to be on my hands . "
613882	613974	613756	613756	I	884	" David Lindt came to me as a client . He was looking for a real estate purchase , something out of town . He was under the delusion that he could afford something much grander . Of course I could n't find anything in his price range , but I felt sorry for him and I ended up selling him a piece of land that I 've been holding on to for a while . There 's nothing much on it , silly little hunting cabin up in the woods . "
613981	614034	613975	613975	She	8036	" He kept talking about how he wanted to make it special for his wife who was coming home soon … Are you sure he is the man you 're looking for ? He was quite sincere about the two of them having a quiet place to really focus on each other . "
614054	614062	614063	614063	I	884	" David Lindt has never been married , "
614067	614081	614063	614063	I	884	" I believe the woman he was preparing the cabin for was Alayna . "
614091	614115	614116	614116	she	215	" Let me write down the address for you , I ’ll not be having a poor Yelp review for abetting a criminal , "
614174	614190	614164	614164	she	1124	" Now , I do expect a good word at the country club for this . "
614246	614366	614242	614242	I	884	" Like fucking hell , Judith . You were a nasty piece of work when you kicked Mirabelle out of the girls club all those years ago , and it ’s clear you ’re still a conniving , selfish , mean girl . While I do n't care who is a member of the club you ’re still so keen to be part of , my mother cares deeply . She 's a member there herself , as you might have known had you not been so hasty to punish my sister , and there is no room for two narcissistic witches of that caliber in one place . Thank you for the information . Have a nice day . "
614404	614427	614398	614398	I	884	" I got the location . I know where he 's taken her . We 're going to need the helicopter fueled . "
614428	614443	614370	614370	she	8040	" I ’ll get on it . Mind telling me where we ’re going ? "
614444	614448	614398	614398	I	884	" Lake Placid . "
614623	614636	614637	614637	he	7091	“ I ’m not assuming that she will be injured or harmed , ”
614647	614674	614637	614637	he	7091	“ But since she ’s been drugged , you ’re going to want to have her checked out anyway . It ’s good to be prepared . ”
614687	614728	614684	614684	he	7091	“ Now call your house . Check on your kids . Talk to Mina . Alayna will want to know how they ’re doing . And I think it would do you some good to hear your child ’s voice . ”
614874	614879	614880	614880	he	7091	“ You should stay — ”
614897	614905	614892	614892	I	884	“ Like hell I ’m staying behind . ”
614918	614942	614913	614913	Jordan	7091	“ Fine , but you ’re not going in the house until we ’ve cleared it . You ’ll hang back , understood ? ”
614979	614985	614986	614986	I	884	“ I ’ll hang back , ”
615519	615525	615526	615526	I	884	“ If you touched her , ”
615549	615611	615526	615526	I	884	“ If you laid even a finger on her , I will break every bone in your body right now with my bare hands . Do n’t think I wo n’t do it , you stupid motherfucker . I ’ll do it , and I ’ll do it in whatever way hurts the most , I swear on my fucking life ! ”
615632	615638	615639	615639	Jordan	7091	“ The house is empty ! ”
615673	615679	615680	615680	I	884	“ Where is she ! ? ”
615689	615712	615680	615680	I	884	“ Where is she ? Tell me now if you want to live another second ! Tell me where my wife is ! ”
615713	615719	615720	615720	he	676	“ I do n’t know ! ”
615728	615738	615720	615720	he	676	“ I was in the woods looking for her ! ”
615835	615848	615849	615849	Jordan	7091	“ There ’s a broken window and possible signs of a struggle , ”
615856	615870	615849	615849	Jordan	7091	“ Some of the pieces of glass seem to have blood on them . ”
616017	616026	616043	616044	My darling	8083	“ Hudson , Hudson , is that you ? ”
616049	616056	616057	616057	I	884	“ Alayna ! Where are you ? ”
616075	616083	616084	616084	she	168	“ Hudson , can you hear me ? ”
616099	616122	616084	616084	she	168	“ Do n’t hang up ! I ’m here . I ’m at the cabin . Tell me where to find you ! ”
616132	616139	616140	616140	she	168	“ Hudson , I love you , ”
616151	616173	616140	616140	she	168	“ I ’ve always loved you . Kiss the babies for me . Tell them ... tell them I loved them ... ”
616174	616177	616178	616178	She	168	“ Alayna ? ”
616183	616194	616178	616178	She	168	“ Alayna , precious , talk to me ! Alayna ! ”
616319	616327	616285	616285	his	8086	" Let them know I loved them . ”
616539	616544	616545	616545	he	8086	" There you are , "
616561	616568	616569	616569	I	884	" I thought I was dying , "
616577	616581	616582	616582	he	8086	" Not dying , "
616586	616633	616582	616582	he	8086	" You have a concussion , a laceration on your thigh which has already been stitched up , a dislocated shoulder , which has been set back into place , cuts on both your hands and feet , and a cracked rib on your right side . "
616634	616637	616680	616680	he	8086	“ Oh . ”
616654	616672	616680	616680	he	8086	“ A cracked rib , huh ? So that 's why it hurts so much to breathe . "
616685	616696	616680	616680	he	8086	" I 'll have them give you more pain medicine . "
616721	616729	616715	616715	I	884	" Hudson , do n't leave me . "
616741	616760	616730	616730	He	8086	" It ’s okay . I 'm here . It 's just a button we have to push . "
616912	616916	616917	616917	I	884	" What happened ? "
616922	616931	616932	616932	He	8086	" I was hoping you could tell me . "
616941	616984	616932	616932	He	8086	" David 's been arrested . When we arrived at the log cabin , we found him , but not you . He insisted he did n’t know where you were , but then you called me . Do you remember that ? "
616985	616989	616990	616990	I	884	“ I do . ”
617040	617060	617061	617061	I	884	" I 'd convinced David to go to the store , thinking I could escape while he was gone , "
617065	617118	617061	617061	I	884	" But I had n't counted on him binding me up before he left . He used duct tape around my ankles and my wrists . I thought it was hopeless . I was sure I ’d still be there when he got back and then I 'd … then he 'd … "
617155	617168	617169	617169	I	884	" Then I remembered this thing that Gwen told me about yesterday , "
617172	617193	617169	617169	I	884	" This trick of getting out of duct tape that she 'd seen at her sex club party last weekend . "
617207	617212	617194	617194	Hudson	168	" Sex club party ? "
617220	617227	617213	617213	I	884	" Do n't get any ideas . "
617228	617235	617236	617236	he	676	" I have absolutely zero interest , "
617239	617247	617236	617236	he	676	" Our sex life is adventurous enough . "
617264	617456	617236	617236	he	676	" Anyway . The struggle was getting out of the room . David locked me in this loft at the top of the cabin . The door was not budging , no matter how many times I tried to slam my bodyweight against it . And all that was in the room was a cot and built - in desk and bookshelves . There was a stool too — that ’s important . I rummaged through the drawers trying to find something to maybe pick the lock — not that I know how to pick a lock — and could n’t find anything , but I did find he 'd left his cell phone . It was locked so he ’d probably thought I could n’t get into it . But I figured out the password easily enough . Zero one zero two — my birthday . Turned out it did n’t matter if I had the password , because the phone was n’t doing anything from that room . There was absolutely no reception . I tried over and over to make a call , and it would n't connect . "
617506	617547	617496	617496	he	8095	“ That left the window . It was just glass in a frame , not the kind that opens , and it was high on the wall , but I had to figure a way to get out of it . ”
617548	617558	617559	617559	he	8095	" So you used the stool to break it , "
617562	617568	617569	617569	I	884	" I gave it away , ”
617573	617629	617569	617569	I	884	“ Yes . I had to stand on the desk to get the right height , and throw the stool at the glass . It took a couple of tries but it finally hit in the right spot . I brushed out the glass pieces as best I could , then I hoisted myself up . ”
617640	617648	617630	617630	I	884	“ That ’s what cut up my hands .
617649	617662	617663	617663	I	884	“ I cut my leg then too , going through the window , "
617667	617747	617663	617663	I	884	" But the biggest problem was the loft was so far off the ground that the fall was more than two stories . I hesitated . It was quite a fall , but then I went for it . I landed on my side and my whole right side blew up with pain . My shoulder , my side , my leg , all of it was throbbing agony . I swear , I almost passed out right then . "
617748	617754	617755	617755	Hudson	168	" But you did n't , "
617765	617772	617755	617755	Hudson	168	" No , I did n’t . ”
617785	617885	617755	617755	Hudson	168	“ I forced myself to get up and get away from the house . I knew we were deep enough in the woods that I was n't going to be able to make it to town , especially in this condition , and I did n’t want to be near the roads in case David was the one who drove by and found me , but I thought if I could just get up the mountain enough to get reception on the phone , then I 'd be able to call you , and you could come find me . "
617960	617981	617982	617982	I	884	“ I was n’t sure if I really spoke to you or if it was some sort of dying mirage , ”
617985	617997	617982	617982	I	884	“ Though , seeing as how I was n’t actually dying … ”
617998	618004	618005	618005	he	884	“ You talked to me , ”
618008	618018	618005	618005	he	884	“ You called , and when I heard you … ”
618089	618115	618079	618079	He	884	“ Then when you were saying your goodbyes ... I ca n’t tell you what that did to me , precious . I was destroyed . ”
618116	618120	618121	618121	I	884	“ I know , ”
618128	618132	618121	618121	I	884	“ Me too . ”
618173	618185	618163	618163	I	884	“ But you did find me . You traced the call ? ”
618189	618302	618186	618186	He	884	“ Jordan called a medic up to meet us before we even knew where you were . Then the team separated to search the area the trace said you ’d be in . You ’d managed to get almost a mile away from the cabin , even barefoot and in misery . You were passed out and ragged , but very much alive , thank God . It was a miracle you made it as long as you did before your body succumbed to shock . The medic put your shoulder back in place right there and gave you some morphine , and then we flew you back here to the city . ”
618303	618315	618316	618316	I	884	“ I sort of remember waking up for part of that , ”
618381	618409	618417	618418	The nurse	5679	“ You were in and out a lot until the morphine kicked in . You were out cold after that . I ’m sure you needed it . ”
618410	618416	618417	618418	The nurse	5679	“ That sounds about right . ”
618482	618495	618496	618496	I	884	“ I wish I ’d been there when you told her off , ”
618504	618512	618499	618499	He	8099	“ I thought you ’d appreciate that . ”
618599	618607	618608	618608	I	884	“ You really got him , right ? ”
618611	618617	618608	618608	I	884	“ The police arrested him ? ”
618618	618670	618685	618685	I	884	“ Well , I almost choked him to death first , but yes . It was only your phone call that saved him from me . And after your call , when I thought you were ... let ’s just say Jordan managed to prevent me from being arrested as well . ”
618691	618700	618685	618685	I	884	“ He wo n’t make bail or anything ? ”
618701	618718	618685	618685	I	884	“ No bail . I have friends in the court who promised to see to that . ”
618743	618753	618754	618754	I	884	“ I thought I ’d never see you again , ”
618773	618778	618779	618779	Hudson	7091	“ Hey , hey . ”
618795	618816	618779	618779	Hudson	7091	“ You ’ll always see me again . You ca n’t get rid of me . I stick , remember ? ”
618847	618863	618844	618844	I	884	“ I ’m gone for one day , and you ’re already stealing my lines . ”
618864	618872	618873	618873	He	7091	“ It was a day too long . ”
618886	618894	618883	618883	he	7091	“ Never leave me again . Promise . ”
618912	618919	618900	618900	I	884	“ I ’m not going anywhere , ”
619126	619135	619136	619136	Alayna	168	" You do n't have to carry me , "
619167	619177	619156	619156	I	884	" Oh , Mrs. Pierce , but I do . "
619698	619706	619692	619692	Mina	1858	" Are you paying attention , Daddy ? "
619707	619711	619712	619712	I	884	" Of course , "
619869	619878	619879	619879	I	884	" I 'm surprised you 're still awake , "
619947	619963	619942	619942	she	9246	" I was waiting for you . I wanted to be with you a little . "
619973	620002	619964	619964	I	884	" Okay . Give me a minute to get ready for bed , and I 'll come join you . Help you get ready for bed , too . "
620125	620137	620138	620138	I	884	" Have I told you today how much I love you ? "
620148	620151	620152	620152	she	9246	" Yes , "
620155	620161	620152	620152	she	9246	" About a million times . "
620162	620176	620138	620138	I	884	" Here 's a million and one . I love you , precious . "
620177	620189	620190	620190	She	9246	" I love you . More than I can ever say . "
620198	620203	620204	620204	she	9246	" I 'm sorry , "
620207	620252	620138	620138	I	884	" Whatever for ? I ’m the one who ’s sorry . I did n't keep you safe . I did n’t figure out who was threatening us . I did n't have the security tight enough . I never told you about Adora . "
620267	620284	620138	620138	I	884	" I should n't have been at work , especially when there was a job fair . "
620285	620294	620138	620138	I	884	" I told you to go to work . "
620295	620312	620138	620138	I	884	" You would n't have told me if I had n't been so catty and jealous . "
620313	620335	620336	620336	I	884	" If I 'd let you in all the way , you would n't have had a reason to be jealous . "
620363	620370	620359	620359	we	8151	" This is n't your fault . "
620384	620391	620371	620371	I	884	" I forgot that would hurt . "
620421	620435	620413	620413	She	8150	" H , did you hear me ? This is n't your fault . "
620441	620453	620436	620436	I	884	" I 'm going to have to work on believing that . "
620468	620553	620454	620454	I	884	" I do know something that was my fault . And I 'm going to fix it . I really did n't let you in , not all the way . Not because I did n't think you could n't handle it , Alayna . You ’re so strong , so unbreakable , you 've proven it surviving everything you 've been through . And because of everything you 've been through I always want to keep you from ever feeling anything bad again . "
620602	620612	620613	620613	I	884	" I understand why I ca n't do that , "
620617	620659	620613	620613	I	884	" And to make sure that I do n't do it again , to prove to you how very much I want you in my world — and I mean every part of my world — I have something for you . "
620674	620704	620712	620712	hers	8150	" This is for you . A key to every door , every desk drawer , every filing cabinet that I own , both here and at the office . "
620758	620802	620732	620732	She	8150	" I 've also had you added to my security level . Jordan has sent you an invitation to the app that will give you access to all the passwords and links he would need to access any of my accounts or information . "
620861	620866	620867	620867	her	8150	" Oh , Hudson , "
620872	620881	620867	620867	her	8150	" I do n't know what to say . "
620882	620887	620888	620888	I	884	" There 's more . "
620908	620992	620888	620888	I	884	" These are all the keys for the event space next door to The Sky Launch , and the deed , in your name . Lee Chong sold it to me , and I know I should 've waited and you wanted to do this yourself , and I 'm trying not to hover , but I really could n't allow you to go back over there without installing our security cameras , and he would n't allow that without a purchase agreement . "
621005	621028	620993	620993	She	8150	" How did you get him to sell so early ? He wanted to wait until the new year , I thought . "
621029	621065	620993	620993	She	8150	" I had to raise my offer to get them to sell earlier . And pay cash . I ’m sorry , but I 'm not . I do hope that you 're not upset . "
621066	621124	621125	621125	She	676	" I 'm not upset . I would 've been too scared to go back over there if you did n’t put in cameras , honestly . And considering how Lee does n't like to work with women , he probably gave you a better price than he would 've given me even with the earlier buy . "
621134	621151	621125	621125	She	676	" I love them . All of them . They are so thoughtful and perfect and … "
621164	621185	621152	621152	She	676	" How did you even have time for all of this ? You 've been by my side for days . "
621186	621228	621158	621158	she	676	" You do n't realize how much you ’ve slept . Besides , you 'd be surprised how much you can do with a laptop and a phone when you 're sitting in a hospital room next to a sleeping patient . "
621290	621299	621300	621300	I	884	" I 'm glad you love the gifts , "
621313	621321	621322	621322	I	884	" Alayna , what are you doing ? "
621334	621340	621341	621341	she	676	" Ca n’t you tell ? "
621344	621362	621325	621325	her	676	" Alayna , precious , we ca n't . It 's too much pressure on your rib . "
621363	621371	621372	621372	she	676	" I 'm still wearing the wrap , "
621381	621416	621372	621372	she	676	" And I had the local anesthetic , and pain pills . The doctor did n't say that we could n't . He said , when I 'm ready . And I need you . "
621459	621466	621456	621456	I	884	" I do n't like this . "
621467	621479	621456	621456	I	884	" Really ? It seems like you like this very much . "
621531	621555	621516	621516	I	884	" Alayna , I always want you . You know that . But this would be too much activity for you right now . "
621561	621564	621565	621565	she	676	" Please , "
621568	621579	621565	621565	she	676	" I need you . I need to erase him . "
621598	621602	621587	621587	She	676	" Did he … "
621603	621606	621607	621607	she	676	" No , "
621611	621638	621607	621607	she	676	" He did n't touch me . But he wanted to . And I need you to help me get that memory out of my head . "
621845	621848	621849	621849	I	884	" Gentle , "
621853	621861	621849	621849	I	884	" We will be gentle and slow . "
621877	621900	621849	621849	I	884	" And you should be on top , so you can control the pressure and there 's less strain to your rib . "
621901	621904	621905	621905	she	676	" Okay , "
621924	621930	621905	621905	she	676	" Help me get undressed . "
622162	622173	622151	622151	she	676	" I need you inside me , Hudson . Please . "
622283	622286	622287	622287	I	884	" Slow , "
622471	622476	622477	622477	she	676	" I ca n't , "
622480	622490	622477	622477	she	676	" You were right . It 's too much . "
622522	622533	622515	622515	my	884	" It 's okay . We do n't need to . "
622534	622538	622539	622539	She	676	“ I know . ”
622546	622555	622556	622556	she	676	" He wanted to make babies with me , "
622560	622566	622567	622567	Her	676	" He wanted to be … "
622571	622612	622567	622567	Her	676	" Everywhere … inside me . And I thought if I could just be filled up with you , it would go away , and I would remember that I do n’t belong to him . That I 'm yours . "
622648	622689	622690	622690	She	676	" Oh , precious . You are mine . Not just because I 'm the man lucky enough to put my cock inside you , but because I ’m the man who is lucky enough to be inside your heart . "
622704	622710	622711	622711	I	884	" And you ’re mine , ”
622715	622779	622711	622711	I	884	“ because you fill every part of me . Every cell , every molecule . Every dark shadow within me , you are there , bringing light . No one can take that away from us , no matter what they want . You ’re mine because I do n't exist without you . How much more mine can you be than that ? ”
623191	623194	623195	623195	I	884	" Hudson ? "
623243	623250	623220	623220	He	8162	" Alayna . Are you okay ? "
623251	623254	623255	623255	I	884	" No , "
623290	623295	623320	623320	His	8162	" What 's wrong ? "
623296	623303	623304	623304	I	884	" You 're not in bed , "
623307	623319	623304	623304	I	884	“ I woke up and did n’t know where you were . ”
623332	623338	623320	623320	His	8162	" But you found me . "
623339	623344	623320	623320	His	8162	" That I did . "
623438	623446	623447	623447	I	884	" What are you doing out here ? "
623460	623463	623464	623464	he	8162	" Dreaming , "
623478	623495	623496	623496	His	8162	" This is not dreaming , Mr. Pierce . I assure you this is very real . "
623533	623536	623537	623537	I	884	" What ? "
623548	623569	623537	623537	I	884	" Do you remember the other day when Mina woke up crying ? And I went in to comfort her ? "
623631	623642	623643	623643	She	1858	" Did she have a nightmare ? I never asked . "
623660	623669	623670	623670	He	6497	" Actually , it was quite the opposite . "
623676	623740	623670	623670	He	6497	" She told me she 'd been dreaming that she lived in a house made of candy — the floorboards were red licorice and she had a chocolate bar for door . There was more . She was very detailed in describing it to me . And she was devastated when she 'd woken up and realized that the dream was n't true . "
623741	623750	623754	623757	the man I loved	2591	" Oh my God , she 's adorable . "
623824	623844	623820	623822	no one else	925	" How did you get her to calm down ? Promise to bribe her with candy the next day ? "
623845	623866	623867	623867	He	8177	" Yes . I did do that . I told her we ’d take a trip to the candy store . "
623870	623959	623867	623867	He	8177	" But then I remembered something Jack used to say when I was really little . I 'd forgotten all about it . Then with Mina ’s dream , it all of a sudden came rushing back to me , this memory of a very similar situation when I was about her age , and my dad putting me on his knee and saying that I did n't need to cry . Because dreams do n't come true from dreaming them — they come true from holding them . "
623989	623998	624039	624039	Sweet	643	" Holding them ? What does that mean ? "
623999	624018	624039	624039	Sweet	643	" You keep it in your heart . Think about it often . Cherish it , I guess . "
624041	624058	624039	624039	Sweet	643	" Wait — you told our daughter to hold her dream so it would come true ? "
624066	624084	624039	624039	Sweet	643	" You 're encouraging Mina to cherish the goal of a house made out of candy ? ! "
624089	624111	624085	624085	He	6778	" We do n't know enough about her yet . She might grow up to be one of those eccentric types . "
624112	624125	624085	624085	He	6778	" She might grow up to be one of those diabetic types . "
624126	624170	624085	624085	He	6778	" Oh come on . She 's four . Who knows how the dream will change ? Maybe she 'll end up running a chocolate factory one day . My dreams obviously changed . I did n't grow up to be a train . "
624175	624193	624171	624171	I	884	" A train ? That 's the dream you wanted to hold onto ? Becoming a train ? "
624199	624207	624208	624208	He	6778	" I told you — people change . "
624215	624248	624208	624208	He	6778	" Anyway , that 's why I was out here . I 'd had a dream that woke me up . A good dream , and I wanted to hold onto it . "
624295	624301	624286	624286	I	884	" Tell me about it ? "
624322	624355	624302	624302	He	6778	" It was n't really long . Just a brief snapshot of an afternoon . Sometime way in the future . We were at Stern and Brett was graduating with her MBA . "
624375	624408	624409	624409	God	8844	" She looked just as beautiful as you did , the first night I saw you at that symposium . And she was just as smart and strong and fearless and enough . "
624442	624448	624409	624409	God	8844	" How did you look ? "
624449	624456	624457	624457	I	884	" I still had my hair . "
624462	624475	624476	624476	He	8844	" Perfect , I bet . You probably aged better than me . "
624488	624524	624476	624476	He	8844	" I still thought you were pretty goddamned sexy . I had wanted to pull you into another dark hallway so I could mess you up before the ceremony , but Bennett was with us . "
624530	624535	624525	624525	I	884	" Who 's Bennett ? "
624536	624545	624525	624525	I	884	" Our son . He 's an oopsie . "
624583	624596	624580	624581	Another kid	11741	" I 'm guessing this means you are n't getting that vasectomy . "
624597	624620	624628	624628	he	8187	" Bennett is your favorite child ! I ca n't bear to go out of business now that I know about him . "
624685	624696	624697	624697	Hudson	168	" How much later does it — he — happen ? "
624702	624717	624718	624718	Jesus	680	" I guess he was ten years younger than the twins . Maybe more . "
624753	624770	624748	624748	I	884	" Who else was there ? Tell me what else we ’re like in the future . "
624771	624850	624748	624748	I	884	" Like I said , it was only a snapshot of this moment . But I did gather a lot . Holden was there — he was already married . And his wife seemed really pregnant . About to burst pregnant . Mina got there late because she was running from work — she was managing The Sky Launch now , and there 'd been some sort of crisis . Jack was there . Sophia … was n't . "
624883	624888	624889	624889	he	6778	" That 's okay , "
624898	624910	624889	624889	he	6778	" I do n't know how to feel about that myself . "
624911	624919	624889	624889	he	6778	" I 'm sure it was sad . "
624920	624925	624926	624926	He	6778	" It was sad . "
624935	624969	624926	624926	He	6778	" Mirabelle and Adam were there . Oh , and Brett 's boyfriend . She was dating one of the Bruzzos . It was pretty serious . He hinted he had a ring . "
625012	625018	625035	625035	I	884	" Which one was it ? "
625019	625034	624988	624990	Gwen 's kids	8197	" Is there a difference ? I do n't know . One of them . "
625040	625045	625035	625035	I	884	" You are terrible . "
625046	625084	625035	625035	I	884	" I should 've known his name . He was working at Pierce Industries . He kept trying to pitch me new ideas during the boring parts of the ceremony . Some of them were actually good . "
625085	625125	625035	625035	I	884	" Man , would n’t that be amazing ? Brett marrying Gwen ’s son , and the two of them taking over your business when you retire . All of it , really . Sounds like an amazeballs future . "
625126	625158	625035	625035	I	884	" I hope it ’s our future . But whatever future I have with you will be perfect . The only required ingredient is that you ’re in it with me . ”
625189	625202	625203	625203	He	8200	“ And you did n’t have a breakdown after your next baby . ”
625209	625224	625203	625203	He	8200	“ Yeah , you went a little crazy again , but we all survived . ”
625246	625248	625249	625249	me	884	“ fixing ”
