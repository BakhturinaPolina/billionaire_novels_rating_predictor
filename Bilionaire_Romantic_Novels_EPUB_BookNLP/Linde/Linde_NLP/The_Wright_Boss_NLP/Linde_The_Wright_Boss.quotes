638	655	608	608	Austin	41	“ Yeah , I ’d rather not have to hear him banging my ex - girlfriend . ”
656	685	608	608	Austin	41	“ I ’m sure he could put your ass on the other side of the house . Then , you ’d only have to imagine him with Emery . ”

1321	1336	1337	1337	Austin	41	“ Bro , you should probably come up with a story to tell Jensen , ”
1340	1344	1345	1345	I	49	“ About what ? ”
1349	1373	1345	1345	I	49	“ Whatever the fuck you ’re dealing with . You know he ’s going to ask , and you ’re a shit liar . ”
1374	1382	1389	1389	Austin	41	“ I ’m not dealing with anything . ”
1383	1388	1389	1389	Austin	41	“ Like I said , ”
1399	1403	1389	1389	Austin	41	“ shit liar . ”
1413	1422	1404	1404	I	49	“ Maybe I ’ll tell him the truth . ”

1722	1731	1732	1732	Jensen	533	“ Do n’t know . Where ’s Emery ? ”
1757	1788	1789	1789	Jensen	533	“ What do you mean , you do n’t know where your wife is ? I ’d rather not have her run into Emery . She still acts like a … ”
1821	1830	1809	1809	he	533	“ Well , she does n’t like Emery . ”
1831	1844	1845	1845	I	49	“ Nothing to worry about then because I did n’t bring her , ”
1866	1877	1861	1861	Jensen	533	“ How the hell did you get away with that ? ”
1878	1886	1887	1887	He	533	“ Give it a rest , Jensen . ”
1894	1898	1887	1887	He	533	“ What happened ? ”
1899	1916	1861	1861	Jensen	533	“ Look , we had a fight , and I left without her . The end . ”
1917	1933	1934	1934	Jensen	533	“ Must have been a pretty big argument for her not to come with you , ”
2006	2022	2023	2023	I	49	“ I ’m leaving her , man . Is that what you wanted to know ? ”
2096	2110	2084	2084	she	221	“ Landon , you know that I just want you to be happy . ”
2111	2129	2130	2130	I	49	“ Yeah , well , I need a drink , not a lecture . Leave it be . ”
2468	2471	2472	2472	I	49	“ Heidi , ”
2485	2490	2491	2491	Her	51	“ Hey , Landon . ”
2511	2517	2491	2491	Her	51	“ Where ’s your wife ? ”
2518	2524	2491	2491	Her	51	“ She ’s not here . ”
2525	2528	2529	2529	she	51	“ Oh , ”
2542	2550	2533	2533	she	51	“ Sorry she could n’t make it . ”
2551	2555	2556	2556	I	49	“ Are you ? ”
2567	2572	2560	2560	She	51	“ Are you drunk ? ”
2573	2583	2533	2533	she	51	“ I might be a bit inebriated , yes . ”
2584	2592	2593	2593	she	51	“ Ah . Inebriated , are we ? ”
2600	2610	2593	2593	she	51	“ Guess you ca n’t be too drunk then . ”
2611	2622	2533	2533	she	51	“ Never know . I ’m still an intelligent drunk . ”
2623	2628	2629	2629	She	51	“ Sure you are . ”
2667	2671	2672	2673	The guy	235	“ Another round ? ”
2678	2692	2672	2673	The guy	235	“ No way in hell . Find someone else to embarrass , Martin . ”
2709	2718	2702	2702	she	51	“ So , what ’s new with you ? ”
2719	2724	2725	2725	I	49	“ A lot actually , ”
2729	2737	2725	2725	I	49	“ Can we go somewhere to talk ? ”
2738	2745	2702	2702	she	51	“ Somewhere , not being here ? ”
2746	2752	2755	2755	I	49	“ Somewhere … more private . ”
2760	2772	2755	2755	I	49	“ I just … don’t like the way we left things . ”
2773	2778	2779	2779	she	51	“ Oh , Landon , ”
2799	2807	2794	2794	I	49	“ Do n’t even worry about it . ”
2808	2811	2812	2812	I	49	“ Heidi , ”
2836	2839	2830	2830	she	51	“ Please . ”
2840	2844	2845	2845	she	51	“ All right , ”
2874	2884	2867	2867	She	51	“ Sure , I ’d love to catch up . ”
3021	3027	3028	3028	I	49	“ Let ’s go outside , ”
3031	3044	3028	3028	I	49	“ Landon , I do n’t think that ’s a good idea . ”
3045	3050	3051	3051	I	49	“ Fuck good ideas . ”
3091	3103	3104	3104	Heidi	51	“ All right , we ’re outside . What ’s up ? ”
3122	3153	3107	3107	She	51	“ The last time we spoke , you said that we should n’t talk anymore . You said what was going on between us was n’t fair to your wife . ”
3154	3159	3160	3160	I	49	“ That was true , ”
3203	3215	3216	3216	I	49	“ This probably is n’t fair to her either , Landon . ”
3267	3279	3259	3259	I	49	“ Do you still feel the way you felt back then ? ”
3280	3283	3284	3284	she	51	“ Landon , ”
3295	3301	3287	3287	Her	51	“ Do n’t do this . ”
3302	3306	3259	3259	I	49	“ Do you ? ”
3307	3354	3287	3287	Her	51	“ I have n’t spoken to you in months . At the time , Emery suspected what was going on , and I ’m her best friend . There ’s girl code to consider . I ca n’t do this . I ca n’t answer you . ”
3355	3388	3389	3389	She	51	“ She ’s dating my brother . I do n’t think that applies anymore , Heidi . Just answer me this ; do you or do you not still care for me ? ”
3429	3432	3433	3433	she	51	“ Yes , ”
3709	3712	3713	3713	I	49	“ Whoa ! ”
3743	3748	3734	3734	I	49	“ Whoa ! Married ! ”
3761	3764	3749	3749	Landon	77	“ Yeah . ”
3765	3771	3772	3772	He	77	“ Are you completely insane ? ”
3829	3834	3835	3835	Landon	77	“ Uh , yeah , ”
3838	3846	3835	3835	Landon	77	“ a bit insane at the moment . ”
3847	3858	3835	3835	Landon	77	“ Well , Jesus Christ , what were you thinking ? ”
3921	3942	3943	3943	I	49	“ That I really wanted to kiss you , and I ’d wanted to do it for too damn long . ”
3954	3965	3966	3966	God	44	“ You ca n’t say things like that to me . ”
4057	4061	4062	4062	he	77	“ I can , ”
4069	4078	4062	4062	he	77	“ But you act like I should n’t . ”
4174	4181	4182	4182	I	49	“ No , you should n’t , ”
4185	4222	4182	4182	I	49	“ I wo n’t do that again . I will not be that kind of girl . It ’s disrespectful to me , and it ’s disrespectful to Miranda . And … it ’s just bad , ”
4356	4362	4363	4363	he	256	“ Yeah , bad idea , ”
4367	4382	4363	4363	he	256	“ I ’m not trying to make you that kind of girl , Heidi . ”
4383	4392	4349	4351	the new guy	256	“ Good , because that would never happen . ”
4393	4407	4410	4410	he	256	“ I ’m just lost , and I want you to find me . ”
4452	4460	4446	4446	he	256	“ Stop that ! No sweet talk . ”
4461	4466	4446	4446	he	256	“ I was n’t — ”
4467	4474	4446	4446	he	256	“ How about no , Landon ? ”
4564	4567	4549	4549	He	256	“ Heidi . ”
4568	4571	4572	4572	I	49	“ What ? ”
4592	4597	4598	4598	he	256	“ I ’m sorry , ”
4601	4604	4605	4605	I	49	“ Stop , ”
4608	4611	4605	4605	I	49	“ Please . ”
4612	4618	4619	4619	My	49	“ I ’m leaving her . ”
4669	4673	4674	4674	I	49	“ Come again ? ”
4677	4692	4674	4674	I	49	“ I left Miranda at home to come here because I ’m leaving her . ”
4787	4790	4791	4791	I	49	“ Wow , ”
4807	4823	4824	4824	He	77	“ I mean … how awful . That has to be so hard , Landon . ”
4830	4837	4838	4838	I	49	“ Heidi , you ’re cute . ”
4847	4866	4838	4838	I	49	“ I tell you I ’m sorry about your wife , and you tell me I ’m cute ? ”
4867	4884	4838	4838	I	49	“ You ca n’t hide how much you hate Miranda any more than my family can . ”
4885	4888	4889	4889	I	49	“ Hey , ”
4897	4911	4889	4889	I	49	“ I do n’t hate Miranda . I do n’t even know her . ”
4912	4927	4838	4838	I	49	“ Well , if you knew her , you ’d hate her , too . ”
4928	4932	4838	4838	I	49	“ Maybe so , ”
4936	4956	4838	4838	I	49	“ But that does n’t make things any easier for you . Clearly , you must have loved her . ”
4957	4964	4965	4965	he	49	“ It ’s just … yeah , ”
4968	4979	4965	4965	he	49	“ I do n’t know . It all happened today . ”
4980	5006	5007	5007	He	49	“ No wonder you ’re drunk and acting like a fool . Maybe we should have addressed you leaving Miranda first and made out second . ”
5011	5022	5007	5007	He	49	“ So , we ’re going to make out again ? ”
5023	5026	5027	5027	I	49	“ No , ”
5062	5073	5074	5074	He	49	“ We should n’t have kissed in the first place . ”
5306	5317	5318	5318	Landon	77	“ Yeah , I probably should n’t have kissed you , ”
5331	5344	5321	5321	He	77	“ But I ’d been thinking about it since New Year ’s . ”
5345	5372	5373	5373	I	49	“ Landon , you ca n’t come here and talk to me like this . If you want to talk about Miranda , I ’m here . ”
5400	5418	5321	5321	He	77	“ We can talk after the reunion , but now , maybe try to forget about it . ”
5419	5425	5321	5321	He	77	“ About Miranda or you ? ”
5426	5429	5321	5321	He	77	“ Both . ”
5430	5436	5437	5437	He	77	“ Not going to happen . ”
5446	5459	5437	5437	He	77	“ There ’s no way I could forget about you , Heidi . ”
5460	5484	5485	5485	I	49	“ You ’ve done fine so far . Do what you ’ve been doing , Landon , and you ’ll have no trouble , ”
5761	5764	5765	5766	the bartender	218	“ Tequila ? ”
5826	5836	5837	5837	Emery	533	“ Care to toast with your bestie and roomie ? ”
5845	5860	5861	5861	I	49	“ The shots are not celebratory unless I am licking them off your stomach , ”
5865	5873	5874	5874	Emery	533	“ Let ’s do it , baby ! ”
5895	5903	5877	5877	She	293	“ Peter , I need the salt ! ”
5904	5915	5916	5916	he	533	“ Oh God , are you two doing this again ? ”
5931	5936	5919	5919	He	533	“ Hand it over ! ”
5940	5955	5956	5956	I	49	“ It ’s really not a reunion if we are n’t drunk and ridiculous , ”
5959	5965	5966	5966	Emery	533	“ Let ’s be real , ”
5969	6000	5966	5966	Emery	533	“ It ’s not a reunion if we ’re not drunk on wine coolers and running from the cops because Landon has pot and is afraid he ’ll get arrested . ”
6029	6032	6033	6033	Jensen	533	“ Honey , ”
6041	6050	6033	6033	Jensen	533	“ what in the hell are you doing ? ”
6051	6065	6066	6066	Jensen	533	“ Body shots . Do n’t tell me you ’ve never done one . ”
6071	6082	6066	6066	Jensen	533	“ Who is doing a body shot off of you ? ”
6083	6089	6090	6090	Emery	533	“ Heidi , of course , ”
6096	6107	6090	6090	Emery	533	“ Yeah , Wright , get out of the way . ”
6143	6165	6136	6136	I	49	“ This is my girlfriend , and we might or might not have done this once or twice in high school . ”
6166	6187	6188	6188	he	533	“ There were a lot of things you two did in high school that do n’t need to be repeated , ”
6191	6195	6196	6196	Emery	533	“ Party pooper , ”
6201	6229	6230	6230	Jensen	533	“ Do n’t listen to him , Em . He ’s jealous because I get to take the shot . We all know he ’s done worse . ”
6362	6368	6369	6369	Landon	533	“ What did I miss ? ”
6390	6394	6383	6383	I	49	“ Body shots . ”
6395	6403	6383	6383	I	49	“ Ah , like old times then . ”
6404	6428	6429	6429	Landon	533	“ You do n’t have any weed on you , do you ? Emery reminded us that you used to be a pothead . ”
6443	6450	6451	6451	Emery	533	“ I was not a pothead . ”
6457	6475	6451	6451	Emery	533	“ Nah , you were too scared of getting caught to be a full - blown pothead . ”
6476	6489	6490	6490	Jensen	533	“ Actually , I think he was too afraid of our dad , ”
6497	6507	6494	6494	Landon	533	“ Well , he could be a scary motherfucker . ”
6508	6522	6523	6524	a guy	301	“ Landon ! Brah , I did n’t know if you ’d come , ”
6651	6654	6655	6655	Landon	533	“ Brandon , ”
6663	6683	6658	6658	They	307	“ Good to see you , man . I did n’t know you were going to be here either . ”
6684	6702	6703	6703	Brandon	49	“ Fuck , man . I would n’t have missed it . High school was the shit , ”
6706	6730	6731	6731	Landon	533	“ Though who am I kidding ? You killed it in high school , and look at you now ! Fucking PGA Tour ! ”
6793	6798	6799	6799	Landon	533	“ Thanks , man , ”
6816	6823	6824	6824	he	533	“ Heidi Martin . Fuck me , ”
6834	6855	6824	6824	he	533	“ You look even hotter than you did in high school , and you were fucking gorgeous ten years ago . ”
6894	6899	6900	6900	I	49	“ Thanks , Brandon , ”
6909	6916	6900	6900	I	49	“ You look great , too . ”
6917	6925	6926	6926	Brandon	49	“ We should definitely catch up later . ”
6935	6950	6951	6951	he	533	“ Definitely . But , first , I ’m going to steal Landon here , ”
6962	6973	6951	6951	he	533	“ and get the rest of the football team together . ”
7149	7152	7153	7153	Emery	533	“ Whoa ! ”
7156	7171	7153	7153	Emery	533	“ Brandon McCain is so fucking into you . Hello , dream come true ! ”
7172	7175	7176	7176	I	49	“ Yeah , ”
7179	7184	7185	7185	Emery	533	“ Dream come true . ”
7192	7243	7185	7185	Emery	533	“ Okay , roomie , we ’re supposed to be having a good time . You know I hate reunions and basically all things high school . But I ’m here for you because I love your face . Tell me what ’s wrong , so I can fix it . ”
7244	7249	7187	7187	her	314	“ Nothing ’s wrong . ”
7250	7301	7302	7302	I	49	“ News flash , Martin ! Brandon fucking McCain just hit on you , and you ’re sad . You would have blown that guy behind the bleachers after a game if he ’d let you . What part of him thinking you ’re super hot is a bad thing ? ”
7431	7437	7438	7438	I	49	“ You ’re so right , ”
7448	7459	7438	7438	I	49	“ There is not a damn thing wrong with that . ”
7460	7477	7438	7438	I	49	“ You sure ? You seemed a little out of it . Maybe you and Landon … ”
7478	7540	7587	7587	she	317	“ Please , do not finish that thought . Landon and I do not belong in the same sentence . You ’ve bugged me about it in the past , Em , but he ’s married . You know what my dad was like . You know I could never do that . And I could never do that to you . ”
7541	7549	7550	7550	I	49	“ But it does n’t bother me . ”
7556	7579	7550	7550	I	49	“ Irrelevant . It bothers me ! Now , let ’s talk about Brandon McCain and how he just hit on me . ”
7613	7643	7644	7644	Emery	533	“ Okay , are you going to hook up with him ? Because he went from being like gruff hottie in high school to being an LA pretty boy , ”
7647	7660	7644	7644	Emery	533	“ I do n’t know if you could fuck a pretty boy . ”
7661	7671	7595	7595	she	317	“ Oh , I could . I assure you . ”
7672	7684	7685	7685	I	49	“ Plus , he used brah in a sentence without irony . ”
7697	7731	7685	7685	I	49	“ So , he ’s not the sharpest tool in the shed . As long as he has a big , long tool I can use , then we ’re good to go . ”
7732	7737	7738	7738	Emery	533	“ Oh my God ! ”
7746	7759	7738	7738	Emery	533	“ I pray that he does , for your sake , Heidi . ”
8277	8286	8287	8287	Emery	533	“ Ugh , who sent in these pictures ? ”
8532	8542	8543	8543	Emery	533	“ Well , I ’d call this a success , ”
8553	8558	8559	8559	I	49	“ A rousing success , ”
8562	8572	8559	8559	I	49	“ Way better than the five - year reunion . ”
8573	8597	8530	8531	Four Heidi	77	“ Yeah . This time , they let me have it at a bar . People are way better when they ’re drunk . ”
8598	8625	8559	8559	I	49	“ True . Also , people have actually changed … sort of … since then . Everyone had just graduated college at the five - year . ”
8626	8635	8636	8636	I	49	“ Or they were on their second kid , ”
8643	8647	8640	8640	Emery	533	“ Or that . ”
8648	8665	8666	8666	Emery	533	“ I ’m glad you came . You ’re going back with Jensen now , right ? ”
8673	8682	8666	8666	Emery	533	“ Do n’t act like you know me . ”
8683	8705	8706	8706	I	49	“ Of course I know you . We ’ve been best friends since kindergarten , and now , we live together ! ”
8729	8735	8736	8736	Emery	533	“ You ’re the best , ”
8739	8745	8736	8736	Emery	533	“ You ’re the bestest . ”
8746	8755	8756	8756	Jensen	533	“ Sorry to break up the romantic moment , ”
8763	8783	8784	8784	Emery	533	“ but I do n’t think we can go home until we get Landon safely back to Austin ’s . ”
8787	8800	8784	8784	Emery	533	“ But I ’m so tired ! I want to go home . ”
8801	8819	8820	8820	I	49	“ As do I , but if you have n’t noticed , he ’s totally fucked up . ”
8925	8960	8920	8920	I	49	“ I ’ll make sure he gets into a cab . I have to be here until bar close to settle up with Peter anyway . I wo n’t let Landon do anything stupid , ”
8965	8970	8971	8971	he	533	“ Are you sure ? ”
9004	9034	9035	9035	I	49	“ Yep . No worries . We have cabs coming at closing to get people . I ’ll make the football players carry him into one . No big , ”
9105	9121	9122	9122	Emery	533	“ Do n’t worry about a thing . Go have a lot of monkey sex . ”
9125	9130	9122	9122	Emery	533	“ I hate you . ”
9131	9139	9149	9149	Jensen	533	“ Love you , too , hooker . ”
9140	9148	9149	9149	Jensen	533	“ Thanks for doing this , Heidi , ”
9163	9185	9186	9186	God	44	“ I really appreciate it . If anything goes wrong or if you need me , do n’t hesitate to call . ”
9195	9210	9186	9186	God	44	“ I wo n’t , but do n’t worry ; it ’ll be fine . ”
9211	9216	9217	9217	he	533	“ Famous last words , ”
9347	9351	9352	9352	He	58	“ Long night ? ”
9357	9366	9352	9352	He	58	“ Pretty busy in case you missed it . ”
9367	9371	9372	9372	Peter	58	“ Noticed that . ”
9386	9392	9393	9393	I	49	“ You ’ve got company . ”
9433	9438	9439	9439	I	49	“ Hey , Brandon , ”
9445	9448	9449	9449	he	58	“ Heidi , ”
9458	9467	9449	9449	he	58	“ You want to get out of here ? ”
9477	9490	9449	9449	he	58	“ I actually have to close down the bar for the reunion . ”
9491	9496	9497	9497	he	58	“ I can wait , ”
9513	9534	9504	9504	I	49	“ No , it ’s okay . It ’ll be boring , and I should just go home after that . ”
9572	9588	9561	9561	He	58	“ Come on , baby . I know you were into me in high school . ”
9596	9607	9589	9589	I	49	“ That was more than ten years ago , Brandon . ”
9608	9616	9561	9561	He	58	“ Could n’t have changed that much . ”
9617	9623	9624	9624	I	49	“ Funny you say that , ”
9630	9692	9624	9624	I	49	“ I would say that I ’ve changed a lot , but you would n’t know that , as you ’ve spent the entire time talking to me about your awesome life in LA and all the roles you could have gotten but missed . I ’m not interested . You missed your chance to get someone as amazing as me . ”
9905	9938	9899	9899	he	533	“ Landon , I told Jensen I ’d get you into a cab at bar close . It ’s two . Time to go back to Austin ’s and sleep this off . ”
9939	9946	9947	9947	he	533	“ Heidi , Heidi , Heidi , ”
9974	9987	9988	9988	I	49	“ Do n’t listen to Jensen . He does n’t know shit . ”
9996	10003	9988	9988	I	49	“ Time to go , Landon . ”
10049	10057	10027	10027	He	533	“ God , you ’re fucked up . ”
10058	10061	10062	10062	he	533	“ Heidi , ”
10066	10069	10062	10062	he	533	“ What ? ”
10070	10077	10078	10078	I	49	“ You heading out with McCain ? ”
10083	10089	10078	10078	I	49	“ What if I am ? ”
10090	10097	10098	10098	Landon	533	“ Have at it , Martin , ”
10105	10123	10098	10098	Landon	533	“ He only fucks anything that walks . Go for it , if you ’re into that . ”
10124	10132	10133	10133	I	49	“ Even if I were into that , ”
10138	10148	10133	10133	I	49	“ it would be none of your goddamn business . ”
10149	10155	10156	10156	he	533	“ None of my business ? ”
10163	10166	10156	10156	he	533	“ Right . ”
10182	10193	10194	10195	one guy	49	“ See you at the after - party , Landon ! ”
10206	10211	10198	10198	Landon	533	“ Yeah , man ! ”
10258	10282	10250	10250	He	533	“ Landon , you ’re drunk . Can you let me get you home , so I can fulfill my promise to Jensen ? ”
10283	10287	10288	10288	Landon	533	“ Fuck Jensen ! ”
10291	10299	10300	10300	I	49	“ I think Em has that covered , ”
10305	10327	10300	10300	I	49	“ Awesome . Another thing we have in common . Shitty wives , a penchant for whiskey , and my ex . ”
10328	10335	10300	10300	I	49	“ Would you cut it out ? ”
10336	10345	10346	10346	Landon	533	“ I ’d normally say blondes , too , ”
10376	10388	10363	10363	I	49	“ Time to go . Let ’s go . Right now . ”
10389	10392	10393	10393	he	533	“ Fine , ”
10472	10481	10459	10459	Peter	58	“ Thanks , Peter . I appreciate it . ”
10482	10488	10489	10489	he	533	“ Be careful , Heidi , ”
10496	10503	10506	10506	he	533	“ Wrights are n’t always right . ”
10563	10579	10585	10585	he	533	“ Thanks for the advice , but you do n’t have to worry about me . ”
10580	10584	10585	10585	he	533	“ I know , ”
10591	10603	10585	10585	he	533	“ You ’re a fighter , just like your old man . ”
10633	10636	10637	10637	I	49	“ Thanks , ”
10645	10651	10637	10637	I	49	“ You ’re the best . ”
10834	10841	10842	10842	he	389	“ God , I ’m drunk , ”
10845	10851	10842	10842	he	389	“ Welcome to my world . ”
10852	10866	10867	10867	he	389	“ I never expected that you ’d be the one taking the initiative , ”
10870	10877	10867	10867	he	389	“ You like it on top ? ”
10878	10889	10842	10842	he	389	“ Do n’t mess with me right now , Landon . ”
10890	10901	10867	10867	he	389	“ Hey , you pushed me back onto the bed . ”
10902	10933	10934	10934	He	389	“ Because you ’re wasted , and I wanted to get you somewhere safe . Now , I ’m going to go home , so I can get some sleep . ”
10942	10947	10934	10934	He	389	“ Stay with me . ”
10962	10966	10948	10948	I	49	“ Not happening . ”
11008	11016	11017	11017	I	49	“ Guess we ’re skipping that talk , ”
11480	11483	11484	11484	I	49	“ Fuuuck , ”
11746	11751	11752	11752	Austin	41	“ Morning , sunshine , ”
11773	11782	11769	11771	a Bloody Mary	71	“ How can you even look at alcohol ? ”
11783	11790	11791	11791	I	49	“ We have a special relationship . ”
11809	11816	11769	11771	a Bloody Mary	71	“ What time is it anyway ? ”
11817	11823	11824	11824	Austin	41	“ One in the afternoon , ”
11827	11830	11831	11831	I	49	“ Fuck , ”
12088	12096	12097	12097	Austin	41	“ So , you banging Heidi now ? ”
12113	12118	12119	12119	I	49	“ I ’m what ? ”
12127	12149	12122	12122	Austin	41	“ She was here last night . Saw her come out of your room when I got back around two thirty . ”
12150	12155	12122	12122	Austin	41	“ She was here ? ”
12156	12182	12183	12183	Austin	41	“ Bro , were you that fucked up that you do n’t remember fucking her ? Because that would explain why she looked so upset , ”
12186	12194	12195	12195	I	49	“ You think I slept with her ? ”
12204	12254	12195	12195	I	49	“ I mean , I do n’t know for sure , but why else would a hot chick be leaving your room at two thirty in the morning ? Plus , with the shit going down with Miranda , I thought you ’d wanted some fun at this reunion . ”
12255	12261	12195	12195	I	49	“ What stuff with Miranda ? ”
12262	12278	12195	12195	I	49	“ Dunno , man . Ca n’t be good if you ’re here without her . ”
12279	12286	12287	12287	I	49	“ Wait , wait , wait , ”
12296	12301	12302	12302	Austin	41	“ Heidi was upset ? ”
12305	12316	12302	12302	Austin	41	“ You really do n’t remember shit , do you ? ”
12317	12328	12338	12338	Austin	41	“ Fuck . I ’m screwed , are n’t I ? ”
12329	12337	12338	12338	Austin	41	“ As far as I see it . ”
12346	12357	12338	12338	Austin	41	“ I think you need this more than I do . ”
12358	12374	12375	12375	I	49	“ Thanks , but I have to figure out what the fuck happened last night . ”
12441	12463	12464	12464	Beep	73	“ Hi , this is Heidi . You know I hate voice mails . If it ’s important , text me . ”
12479	12484	12485	12485	I	49	“ Fuck , Heidi , ”
12656	12659	12660	12660	she	71	“ Hey , ”
12664	12671	12660	12660	she	71	“ Hey . Thanks for answering . ”
12672	12681	12660	12660	she	71	“ I ’m not sure why I did . ”
12682	12707	12660	12660	she	71	“ Because leaving me at two thirty in the morning , drunk off my ass , is not how you wanted to end things . ”
12708	12718	12660	12660	she	71	“ Yeah . How are you feeling this morning ? ”
12719	12735	12736	12736	I	49	“ Hungover and with a severe lack of memory of several hours of last night , ”
12739	12743	12744	12744	she	71	“ I see , ”
12747	12757	12744	12744	she	71	“ Care to fill me in on the details ? ”
12758	12770	12771	12771	she	71	“ Nothing happened , if that ’s what you ’re asking , ”
12779	12816	12771	12771	she	71	“ I told you I would n’t do anything with you while you were still with Miranda . Anyway , do you think I ’d take advantage of someone as drunk as you were last night ? ”
12817	12846	12744	12744	she	71	“ No , I did n’t think you would . I just did n’t know if I ’d made a total fool of myself in front of you . ”
12847	12901	12902	12902	I	49	“ If insinuating that I was going to fuck Brandon McCain because he ’d flattered me with his obnoxious attention , getting so wasted that you were drinking beer straight from a pitcher , and blacking out as soon as I got you into bed make you a total fool , then yes . ”
12934	12943	12771	12771	she	71	“ Yeah . Sorry about all of that . ”
12944	12970	12744	12744	she	71	“ It ’s fine , Landon . It ’s fine . I should just go . I do n’t think we should be talking anymore . ”
12971	12985	12771	12771	she	71	“ Heidi , please . You said that we were going to talk . ”
12986	12995	12771	12771	she	71	“ Yeah , and then you got wasted ! ”
12996	13005	12744	12744	she	71	“ I know . Have brunch with me . ”
13006	13014	13015	13015	she	420	“ You can not ask me out ! ”
13018	13042	13015	13015	she	420	“ It ’s just brunch , Heidi . You said we ’d talk after the reunion . Can I call in that favor ? ”
13043	13046	13051	13051	I	49	“ No . ”
13047	13050	13051	13051	I	49	“ Heidi , ”
13054	13057	13058	13058	She	420	“ Please . ”
13071	13081	13058	13058	She	420	“ Fine . Brunch . Half hour enough time ? ”
13082	13097	13051	13051	I	49	“ Yes , that ’s plenty of time . Thank you . Café J ? ”
13098	13110	13111	13111	I	49	“ All right . I ’ll see you there , Landon . ”
13235	13240	13241	13241	I	49	“ Hey , bro , ”
13271	13291	13292	13292	Jensen	533	“ Landon , I hate to call you so early in the afternoon , considering your condition last night , ”
13312	13324	13305	13305	his	533	“ Yeah . Last night was rough . What ’s up ? ”
13325	13339	13305	13305	his	533	“ Miranda just showed up at my door , demanding to see you . ”
13340	13345	13346	13346	I	49	“ She did what ? ”
13349	13380	13346	13346	I	49	“ I guess she took the early flight out of Tampa this morning and just got into town . She came straight here , thinking that you would be here . ”
13381	13392	13393	13393	Jensen	533	“ Did you tell her I was at Austin ’s ? ”
13396	13407	13393	13393	Jensen	533	“ Of course I did . She ’s your wife . ”
13408	13413	13346	13346	I	49	“ Fuck , Jensen . ”
13414	13442	13443	13443	I	49	“ Handle your shit , Landon , or let me help . Otherwise , you ’re going to keep ending up right back at this same place . ”
13465	13473	13474	13474	My	49	“ Thanks for the heads - up . ”
13581	13588	13589	13589	I	49	“ Miranda is on her way , ”
13613	13620	13602	13602	Austin	41	“ That ’s bad , right ? ”
13621	13642	13604	13604	his	41	“ Probably . I have to make a phone call . Will you answer the door if she shows up ? ”
13643	13670	13602	13602	Austin	41	“ Well , I was going to see if you wanted to get lunch with me and Patrick , but that sounds out of the question . ”
13671	13689	13602	13602	Austin	41	“ Yeah , I do n’t think I ’ll be able to hang with you guys now . ”
13700	13716	13602	13602	Austin	41	“ Can you answer ? I have to make a call before she gets here . ”
13717	13723	13724	13724	Austin	41	“ I ’ll run interference , ”
13836	13846	13820	13820	I	49	“ Pick up , pick up , pick up , ”
13890	13893	13894	13894	I	49	“ Fuck , ”
13936	13939	13940	13940	Austin	41	“ Miranda , ”
13949	13958	13940	13940	Austin	41	“ I was n’t expecting to see you . ”
13959	13964	13965	13965	she	429	“ Where ’s Landon ? ”
13973	13985	13986	13986	Miranda	84	“ He ’s a bit hungover , but he ’s here . ”
14000	14005	13994	13994	He	41	“ Come on in . ”
14123	14126	14127	14127	she	84	“ Landon ! ”
14149	14156	14135	14135	She	84	“ I ’ve been so worried . ”
14217	14226	14227	14227	I	49	“ Hey , what are you doing here ? ”
14238	14245	14246	14246	she	84	“ What am I doing here ? ”
14251	14270	14246	14246	she	84	“ After you walked out of the house without me , what did you expect me to do ? ”
14271	14277	14278	14278	Her	84	“ Stay home in Tampa . ”
14282	14325	14326	14326	Austin	41	“ I could never do that , Landon . You had to know I could never watch you walk away and be okay with it . I was devastated . I had to follow you . I had to make this right . ”
14331	14358	14326	14326	Austin	41	“ Sorry to interrupt . I ’m going to … head out and get some lunch with Patrick . Let me know if you need anything . ”
14359	14364	14365	14365	I	49	“ Thanks , Austin , ”
14411	14439	14405	14405	Miranda	84	“ I ’m so , so sorry , Landon . I am . Truly . You have to know how sorry I am about all of this . ”
14448	14463	14440	14440	I	49	“ I do n’t actually . You seemed like you meant what you said . ”
14464	14514	14440	14440	I	49	“ You know I did n’t . I was frustrated and worried about you when you heard me on the phone with Janice . It ’s not every day that we have to face the news from your doctor that you might never be able to play golf again . ”
14623	14636	14637	14637	I	49	“ No , I ’d hoped to never have to hear that , ”
14640	14687	14637	14637	I	49	“ But I also did n’t expect for you to tell Janice that you did n’t want to have kids after we ’d spent the last year doing everything possible to make that happen , then blow up on me when I asked you about it . ”
14725	14730	14731	14731	she	171	“ I ’m sorry , ”
14734	14750	14731	14731	she	171	“ I ’m so sorry . It was a joke between girls . I swear . ”
14751	14819	14698	14698	she	171	“ Well , it was n’t a funny joke considering we lost a child and I ’ve catered to your every whim the last year in an attempt to make it right . Then you tell her that you do n’t want a kid to end up like a Wright so you ’re not having one . Excuse me if I do n’t think that ’s funny . ”
14820	14825	14826	14826	she	171	“ It was stress , ”
14830	14907	14826	14826	she	171	“ I know I should n’t have said it . I did n’t mean it . Everything I said was me being worried about your career and came out all wrong . It was n’t anything else . I want you to get better . I want you to do what you love again . You know that you ’re my first priority . Always . And I flew all this way to make it right . ”
14927	14936	14937	14937	she	171	“ Landon , let me make this right , ”
15050	15057	15058	15058	I	49	“ One more chance , Miranda , ”
15062	15082	15083	15083	She	171	“ Just one and if I ever feel this way again . I ’m gone . Do you understand ? ”
15087	15095	15083	15083	She	171	“ You never will . I promise . ”
15573	15580	15581	15582	the hostess	448	“ Should be about fifteen minutes , ”
15585	15588	15581	15582	the hostess	448	“ Thanks . ”
15665	15702	15703	15703	Beep	73	“ Hey . This is Landon Wright , and you ’ve reached my voice mail . I ’m not here right now , but if you leave a message , I ’ll get back to you . ”
15732	15735	15736	15737	the hostess	448	“ Martin , ”
15740	15745	15736	15737	the hostess	448	“ That ’s me ! ”
16519	16522	16514	16514	I	49	“ Hello ? ”
16523	16535	16536	16536	Emery	533	“ Hey ! I just got home . Where are you ? ”
16539	16556	16514	16514	I	49	“ I went to get some food but lost my appetite and did n’t eat anything . ”
16557	16577	16514	16514	I	49	“ That ’s lame . You should probably eat something . Want me to make you something at home ? ”
16578	16585	16586	16586	I	49	“ No , that ’s okay . ”
16604	16609	16594	16594	My	49	“ What ’s up ? ”
16610	16640	16514	16514	I	49	“ I have so much to dish to you . I wanted to tell you as soon as I got home . Are you going to be out long ? ”
16641	16650	16651	16651	I	49	“ I ’m on my way home actually , ”
16667	16677	16654	16654	I	49	“ Be there in , like , ten minutes . ”
16678	16690	16691	16691	Emery	533	“ Okay . Well , I ca n’t wait that long , ”
16694	16705	16706	16706	I	49	“ Miranda showed up at Jensen ’s house this morning . ”
16714	16723	16706	16706	I	49	“ Miranda ? Like … Landon ’s wife ? ”
16741	16791	16706	16706	I	49	“ Yeah . Like the crazy bitch lady who screams at me every time she sees me even though she knows that Jensen and I are together and I have no interest in Landon . She ’s a total monster . Jensen detests her , to put it mildly . ”
16792	16799	16800	16800	I	49	“ What was she doing there ? ”
16838	16862	16833	16833	I	49	“ She was looking for Landon , but as you know , this trip , he ’s staying with Austin , not Jensen . ”
16863	16866	16706	16706	I	49	“ Right . ”
16878	16886	16706	16706	I	49	“ But … what did she want ? ”
16887	16930	16833	16833	I	49	“ Not sure . What I gathered from her clipped conversation with Jensen was that they ’d had an argument , Landon had threatened to leave her , and she was here to make things right . Whatever the hell that means . ”
16931	16934	16935	16935	I	49	“ Yeah , ”
17130	17140	17141	17141	Emery	533	“ Heidi ? Hey , are you still there ? ”
17160	17169	17150	17150	she	470	“ Yeah , sorry . I ’m driving . ”
17170	17182	17150	17150	she	470	“ That ’s cool . You went quiet on me there . ”
17183	17194	17195	17195	I	49	“ I do n’t think I ’m feeling that great , ”
17198	17202	17203	17203	Emery	533	“ Oh no , ”
17206	17217	17218	17218	I	49	“ We ’ll have to do some Netflix and chill . ”
17222	17237	17218	17218	I	49	“ You do know that means we ’re going to have sex , right ? ”
17238	17241	17218	17218	I	49	“ And ? ”
17242	17247	17248	17248	I	49	“ Count me in , ”
17274	17277	17278	17278	Emery	533	“ Heidi , ”
17282	17285	17278	17278	Emery	533	“ Yeah ? ”
17286	17292	17278	17278	Emery	533	“ Is this about Landon ? ”
17293	17299	17300	17300	I	49	“ Is what about Landon ? ”
17312	17321	17305	17305	she	472	“ You know … about him and Miranda . ”
17322	17330	17331	17331	Emery	533	“ No . I do n’t know . ”
17334	17358	17331	17331	Emery	533	“ I know you like him , Heidi . You do n’t hide things from me as well as you think you do . ”
17359	17366	17367	17367	I	49	“ I do n’t like him , ”
17378	17381	17382	17382	Emery	533	“ Okay , ”
17386	17418	17382	17382	Emery	533	“ Well , I do n’t know what ’s happening with Miranda , but if Jensen has anything to say about it , they ’ll be divorced sooner rather than later . ”
17419	17427	17382	17382	Emery	533	“ I wo n’t hold my breath . ”
17428	17448	17382	17382	Emery	533	“ Well , come home , and we can eat ice cream and binge - watch Buffy , okay ? ”
17449	17457	17458	17458	I	49	“ Sounds good . See you soon . ”
18385	18388	18389	18389	Jensen	533	“ Hey , ”
18407	18416	18396	18396	I	49	“ Hey , did I wake you up ? ”
18417	18427	18428	18428	Jensen	533	“ No , no . Go back to sleep , ”
18447	18461	18441	18441	he	533	“ Sorry about that . I ’m up . What ’s going on ? ”
18462	18482	18483	18483	Jensen	533	“ I wanted to let you know that Miranda and I are taking an early flight out this morning . ”
18490	18496	18483	18483	Jensen	533	“ You ’re leaving already ? ”
18497	18518	18441	18441	he	533	“ Yeah . I think I need to get back to my life and figure out what ’s going on . ”
18519	18523	18483	18483	Jensen	533	“ With Miranda ? ”
18524	18527	18528	18528	I	49	“ Yes , ”
18532	18536	18528	18528	I	49	“ And golf . ”
18537	18544	18545	18545	Jensen	533	“ Your injury is n’t healing , ”
18548	18560	18561	18561	I	49	“ I noticed you were careful with it at the reunion . ”
18630	18639	18622	18622	I	49	“ Yeah . We ’ll see what happens . ”
18640	18649	18650	18650	he	533	“ And you ’re going to miss church , ”
18717	18732	18710	18710	I	49	“ Yeah , sorry . You know I want to be there , but — ”
18733	18755	18756	18756	I	49	“ Yeah , yeah . Just figure out your life . Call me if you need me … or a lawyer . ”
18759	18771	18756	18756	I	49	“ Thanks , man . I ’ll keep that in mind . ”
19150	19155	19143	19143	I	49	“ What the fuck ? ”
19250	19255	19237	19237	Miranda	84	“ I can explain . ”
19256	19262	19263	19263	I	49	“ You can … explain ? ”
19268	19274	19263	19263	I	49	“ We ’ve been robbed . ”
19301	19306	19307	19307	she	84	“ We have n’t , ”
19311	19320	19307	19307	she	84	“ How the hell do you know that ? ”
19358	19364	19365	19365	she	84	“ Because I did it , ”
19368	19373	19365	19365	she	84	“ You did what ? ”
19374	19385	19386	19386	she	84	“ I was upset , and I got carried away , ”
19440	19446	19447	19447	I	49	“ You trashed our house , ”
19454	19461	19462	19462	She	84	“ I said I was upset . ”
19687	19692	19693	19693	Miranda	84	“ Do n’t worry , ”
19696	19712	19693	19693	Miranda	84	“ I ’ll have someone come to clean it up . It ’ll be fine . ”
19713	19716	19717	19717	I	49	“ Fine , ”
19720	19723	19724	19724	She	84	“ Yep . ”
19758	19788	19749	19749	she	84	“ I ’m going to go up and change . I scheduled a massage and facial for later today . After this horrible weekend , I need to detox . ”
19818	19822	19823	19823	I	49	“ Fuck this , ”
20129	20132	20133	20133	Jensen	533	“ Landon ? ”
20140	20146	20133	20133	Jensen	533	“ You back in Tampa ? ”
20147	20156	20157	20157	I	49	“ You said that you ’d help me , ”
20183	20186	20177	20177	We	527	“ Miranda ? ”
20187	20195	20196	20196	Jensen	533	“ I think I need a lawyer . ”
20201	20211	20196	20196	Jensen	533	“ I was afraid it would come to this . ”
20212	20224	20177	20177	We	527	“ Yeah . I ’m done . I ’m so done . ”
20225	20256	20196	20196	Jensen	533	“ I ’ll get on it right away . Florida is a no - fault state . You know she ’ll be getting half of your golf money , right ? ”
20257	20262	20263	20263	I	49	“ Fuck my money , ”
20266	20279	20263	20263	I	49	“ Just letting you know . Half of everything after the prenup . ”
20280	20311	20196	20196	Jensen	533	“ It does n’t matter . Something has to change . She ’s not the woman I married . She ’s not the woman I want to be married to . ”
20312	20323	20324	20324	he	533	“ What are you going to do in the meantime ? ”
20327	20338	20196	20196	Jensen	533	“ You ca n’t live in that house with her . ”
20339	20373	20263	20263	I	49	“ I do n’t know . I have a doctor ’s appointment tomorrow . I ’ll know more about what is happening with golf then . After that … I’ll figure it out . ”
20374	20386	20387	20387	I	49	“ Focus on getting better . Let me handle the rest . ”
20459	20471	20472	20472	I	49	“ I do n’t know about a third date , Julia , ”
20485	20495	20496	20496	Julia	84	“ Nick was almost too nice , too normal . ”
20501	20525	20496	20496	Julia	84	“ You need nice and normal , girl . All you have been dealing with are assholes , douche bags , and jerkfaces . ”
20534	20542	20526	20526	I	49	“ So , I have a type . ”
20543	20558	20559	20559	She	84	“ You do not have a type . I had that type , remember ? ”
20587	20601	20526	20526	I	49	“ Bad girls attract bad boys . You are like the prom queen . ”
20602	20609	20526	20526	I	49	“ I was not prom queen . ”
20610	20640	20641	20641	she	84	“ Your hair is bleach blonde to your waist , and you ’re wearing more bright colors than I have in my whole wardrobe . Plus , high heels , ”
20646	20659	20641	20641	she	84	“ I attract the bad boys . You go looking for them . ”
20660	20675	20676	20676	Julia	84	“ So what ? I ’m only twenty - eight . Live a little . ”
20680	20713	20676	20676	Julia	84	“ Oh , I ’ve lived way too much for the both of us . I ’m content with not living like I used to and finding a nice and normal dude . ”
20714	20718	20719	20719	I	49	“ Like Trevor ? ”
20722	20728	20729	20729	Julia	84	“ Yes , like Trevor . ”
20956	20963	20964	20964	Julia	84	“ Just give Nick another chance , ”
20999	21010	21011	21011	I	49	“ All right . I ’ll go for date three , ”
21018	21044	21011	21011	I	49	“ What else am I going to do this weekend besides plan Emery ’s surprise birthday party ? Do you think you can make it ? ”
21045	21049	21050	21050	Julia	84	“ Next Monday ? ”
21053	21056	21011	21011	I	49	“ Yep . ”
21057	21065	21011	21011	I	49	“ And she still has no clue ? ”
21066	21085	21011	21011	I	49	“ Emery hates , hates , hates birthdays . She does not suspect that I have anything planned . ”
21086	21098	21011	21011	I	49	“ I might have to be late . Is that cool ? ”
21099	21107	21108	21108	I	49	“ You ’ll miss the surprise part . ”
21111	21134	21108	21108	I	49	“ Okay , okay . I ’ll reschedule my hair appointment . The girl is so hard to get in to see . ”
21135	21143	21011	21011	I	49	“ You just got your hair done ! ”
21144	21149	21150	21150	Julia	84	“ Upkeep , bitch , ”
21156	21166	21150	21150	Julia	84	“ I do n’t look this fabulous for nothing . ”
21167	21178	21179	21179	Julia	84	“ Yes , you do . You always look fabulous . ”
21195	21208	21209	21209	I	49	“ So , is , uh … Austin going to be there ? ”
21222	21243	21209	21209	I	49	“ Are you ever going to tell me what happened with you and Austin Wright after the office Christmas party ? ”
21244	21249	21250	21250	Julia	84	“ Not a chance , ”
21277	21306	21256	21256	She	84	“ Austin Wright completely proves my point of the bad boys finding me . I like to file him under The Past I Will Never Look at Again . ”
21307	21321	21322	21322	I	49	“ At least he has n’t been in your office as much lately , ”
21425	21436	21437	21437	Julia	84	“ He comes and goes , depending on the week . ”
21440	21467	21468	21468	I	49	“ I do n’t want to talk about Austin . Let ’s talk about Nick . Do you think you guys are going to have sex ? ”
21471	21492	21468	21468	I	49	“ I think we have a while to go . We ’ve kissed , but it was n’t really anything . ”
21663	21678	21679	21679	Julia	84	“ Ugh ! I just want you to fall in love , like me ! ”
21682	21693	21679	21679	Julia	84	“ It ’ll happen . Maybe . Someday . Never . ”
21694	21699	21706	21706	Jim	92	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
21700	21705	21706	21706	Jim	92	“ Hey , Heidi , ”
21717	21740	21706	21706	Jim	92	“ Morgan came by and asked for the entire engineering and project team to convene in the conference room . Some announcement . ”
21741	21745	21746	21746	Julia	84	“ What announcement ? ”
21749	21766	21746	21746	Julia	84	“ I do n’t know what it ’s about , but I need to steal Heidi . ”
21767	21776	21777	21777	I	49	“ Okay , I ’ll be right there , ”
21789	21802	21780	21780	I	49	“ I guess I ’ll go see what that ’s all about . ”
21803	21810	21746	21746	Julia	84	“ Keep me in the loop . ”
21811	21815	21816	21816	I	49	“ Will do . ”
21990	21995	21996	21996	Matt	49	“ Hey , Heidi , ”
22035	22047	22048	22048	I	49	“ Hey , do you know what this announcement is about ? ”
22090	22096	22084	22084	I	49	“ No idea . You ? ”
22097	22100	22101	22101	I	49	“ Nope , ”
22164	22172	22173	22173	he	49	“ Jim thinks someone is getting fired , ”
22224	22242	22211	22211	He	49	“ Why would they bring everyone together to fire someone ? Is n’t that kind of personal ? ”
22243	22257	22211	22211	He	49	“ Yeah , true . Maybe it ’s a new project or something . ”
22258	22295	22296	22296	Matt	49	“ After we took over Tarman Corporation last year , I do not want to think about adding on another new project . I feel like we ’ve finally caught up from how shitty they were . ”
22306	22311	22296	22296	Matt	49	“ Yeah , definitely . ”
22490	22493	22494	22494	I	49	“ What ? ”
22507	22516	22494	22494	I	49	“ Sorry , I missed what you said . ”
22517	22531	22534	22534	he	49	“ Uh … I was seeing if you were free on Friday night . ”
22577	22580	22581	22581	I	49	“ Oh , ”
22584	22599	22581	22581	I	49	“ That ’s sweet , Matt , but I ’m kind of seeing someone . ”
22623	22631	22632	22632	he	49	“ Right . Totally . Of course , ”
22880	22912	22913	22913	she	48	“ Thank you for convening here on such short notice this early in the morning . I ’ll make it brief , so you can go back to your coffee breaks , ”
22943	22979	22935	22935	Morgan	48	“ I wanted to let you know that we have reorganized the company a bit , and we ’re adding a new level of management to this department that has been needed for some time . ”
23052	23090	23139	23139	she	48	“ Do n’t worry . It does n’t change anything with what you already do . We have recently hired on a new employee who will be filling the void in this area . Is that clear ? ”
23097	23130	23131	23131	Morgan	48	“ We can work out the kinks as we go , but I think this will be a good solution for everyone involved . Let me introduce you to your new boss , ”
23781	23789	23790	23790	I	49	“ He ca n’t be my boss , ”
23795	23801	23790	23790	I	49	“ He ca n’t be . ”
24291	24296	24297	24297	he	49	“ Are you okay ? ”
24305	24320	24321	24321	His	49	“ Totally fine . Just had an emergency . You know , girl stuff . ”
24348	24356	24357	24357	I	49	“ So , did I miss anything ? ”
24360	24380	24357	24357	I	49	“ Nah , you were there for most of it . All the Wrights are under one roof now . ”
24381	24393	24321	24321	His	49	“ Well , not Sutton . She just had her baby . ”
24394	24399	24400	24400	Matt	49	“ Right . True , ”
24403	24412	24321	24321	His	49	“ What did she name it ? James ? ”
24413	24419	24357	24357	I	49	“ She named him Jason . ”
24420	24447	24357	24357	I	49	“ I still ca n’t believe that he took her last name instead of the other way around . I ca n’t imagine ever doing that . ”
24448	24468	24469	24469	I	49	“ Ah , yes . How ever did women survive all these generations , dealing with changing their name ? ”
24476	24503	24469	24469	I	49	“ It makes sense that he ’d change his name , considering who Sutton is . Then , they can have the baby be a Wright . ”
24504	24509	24510	24510	My	49	“ It ’s emasculating . ”
24519	24538	24539	24539	He	49	“ And how do you think women feel , having to change their name to fit a man ? ”
24559	24563	24564	24564	I	49	“ Forget it , ”
24574	24625	24626	24626	Jim	92	“ A lot of women really love the idea of changing their name . Maybe Maverick suggested it . Maybe it was n’t emasculating to him at all . At the very least , I ’m sure that he wanted his son to be Jason Wright instead of Jason Johnson . ”
24640	24657	24626	24626	Jim	92	“ Hey , Heidi . The new Wright boss wants to see you in his office . ”
24658	24662	24663	24663	I	49	“ Right now ? ”
24673	24682	24663	24663	I	49	“ Uh … yeah , I think so . ”
24683	24693	24694	24694	Jim	92	“ Oh , okay . Where is his office ? ”
24803	24806	24807	24807	I	49	“ Thanks , ”
25005	25008	25009	25009	he	77	“ Heidi , ”
25012	25021	25009	25009	he	77	“ Please come in . Shut the door . ”
25086	25093	25094	25094	I	49	“ You asked to see me , ”
25102	25123	25094	25094	I	49	“ Yes . I ’ve decided to meet with everyone on my team to get to know my new employees . ”
25153	25162	25163	25163	Landon	77	“ And you decided to start with me ? ”
25195	25198	25199	25199	he	77	“ Yes , ”
25203	25211	25199	25199	he	77	“ I decided to start with you . ”
25212	25249	25250	25250	Landon	77	“ Let ’s not do this , Landon . I ’m pretty sure we already know that you know me better than most of your employees . And that ’s all I am — an employee . ”
25309	25321	25322	25322	he	77	“ Do n’t you want to know why I ’m here ? ”
25332	25338	25339	25339	He	77	“ It does n’t matter . ”
25346	25349	25339	25339	He	77	“ Heidi — ”
25350	25379	25380	25380	Landon	77	“ It really does n’t . This is my career . I ’ve worked hard to get to where I am . I was n’t born into this . ”
25434	25446	25447	25447	I	49	“ Not that you do n’t deserve your position or anything , ”
25450	25493	25447	25447	I	49	“ But I think we should keep our relationship professional . Having conversations with the door closed … is probably not a good idea . There ’s no reason to muddy the waters . You know … what ’s done is done . ”
25494	25503	25504	25504	His	77	“ Right . Good . Yeah . Professional . ”
25509	25516	25517	25517	I	49	“ Good . I ’m glad , ”
25566	25577	25578	25578	Landon	77	“ I believe that is all then , Miss Martin , ”
25619	25631	25632	25632	I	49	“ I ’ll just get back to work then … boss . ”
25798	25801	25802	25802	I	49	“ Fuck , ”
25823	25831	25832	25832	I	49	“ This is never going to work , ”
26273	26278	26279	26279	Morgan	48	“ What ’s up ? ”
26282	26294	26295	26295	Morgan	48	“ I appreciate everything you did to get me this job . ”
26300	26305	26295	26295	Morgan	48	“ Are you quitting ? ”
26306	26311	26295	26295	Morgan	48	“ Um … no ? ”
26312	26323	26324	26324	I	49	“ Who are you ? Ben from Parks and Rec ? ”
26331	26349	26350	26350	Morgan	48	“ Last I checked , I was n’t an accountant who kept refusing to work for you . ”
26353	26361	26350	26350	Morgan	48	“ Well , what ’s the issue ? ”
26362	26369	26350	26350	Morgan	48	“ I want to switch positions . ”
26370	26375	26376	26376	I	49	“ You … what ? ”
26441	26453	26454	26454	I	49	“ I think I need to be in a new job , ”
26457	26460	26461	26461	she	221	“ Landon , ”
26478	26581	26461	26461	she	221	“ do you know what we went through to get you this job on such short notice ? We had to shuffle and reorganize the company . I essentially invented a job for you in a place where another position could fit seamlessly into the structure already in place . I had to analyze all the jobs from top to bottom , and this job is it . I mean , if you want to go work on a construction site , then by all means , we have plenty of jobs . Not sure your back could handle the machinery though . ”
26582	26594	26595	26595	I	49	“ Yeah , yeah . My back ca n’t handle much , ”
26674	26722	26723	26723	She	48	“ So , as you can see , this is the best I can offer . I did n’t think you ’d want to actually work in construction … or even if that was possible for you . And , really , my secretary position is filled . ”
26726	26743	26723	26723	She	48	“ Ha ! I would never work as your secretary . We ’d kill one another . ”
26744	26762	26723	26723	She	48	“ I ’m pretty sure , with the condition you ’ve been in , I ’d win . ”
26763	26770	26723	26723	She	48	“ We ’ll see about that . ”
26771	26774	26775	26775	Morgan	48	“ So , ”
26778	26801	26775	26775	Morgan	48	“ why do n’t you want this job now that I ’ve gone to all this work to get it for you ? ”
26905	26912	26913	26913	Morgan	48	“ Come on , tell me , ”
26916	26925	26926	26926	I	49	“ I guess I ’m just not qualified , ”
26942	26969	26929	26929	Morgan	48	“ You have a Stanford business degree . You graduated in the top ten percent of your class . You know how to run a business . ”
26970	26981	27003	27003	She	48	“ Well , I do n’t really have any experience . ”
26982	27002	27003	27003	She	48	“ God , stop . You know more about Wright Construction than anyone could because you are Wright Construction . ”
27013	27040	27041	27041	I	49	“ Just do your job , and you ’ll be fine . Everyone always likes you . They ’ll see you know what you ’re doing . ”
27046	27057	27041	27041	I	49	“ Right . Yeah . Sorry to bring it up . ”
27231	27244	27226	27226	Morgan	48	“ You ’ll be back at your game before you know it . ”
27254	27261	27245	27245	I	49	“ What if I ’m not ? ”
27262	27293	27294	27294	I	49	“ Do n’t doubt it . I believe in a healthy dose of optimism . You love it too much . And , anyway , Wrights do n’t give up . ”
28456	28459	28460	28460	Landon	77	“ Hey , ”
28479	28482	28475	28475	My	49	“ Hey . ”
28517	28523	28524	28524	he	77	“ You heading out early ? ”
28533	28545	28546	28546	He	77	“ Yeah . It ’s Friday . Is that a problem ? ”
28551	28560	28546	28546	He	77	“ Nope . Not a problem with me . ”
28561	28564	28565	28565	I	49	“ Great , ”
28568	28577	28578	28578	His	77	“ I did n’t think I needed permission . ”
28599	28610	28594	28594	God	44	“ You do n’t . Not from me at least . ”
28611	28614	28615	28615	I	49	“ Wonderful , ”
28639	28648	28594	28594	God	44	“ Heidi , can we not do this ? ”
28649	28663	28664	28664	Landon	77	“ Oh , I ’m Heidi now ? What happened to Miss Martin ? ”
28682	28705	28594	28594	God	44	“ If we ’re going to be around each other , then we should maybe try to be civil . Friends even . ”
28706	28713	28714	28714	I	49	“ We are friends , Landon , ”
28721	28725	28714	28714	I	49	“ Just friends . ”
28895	28898	28879	28879	he	77	“ What ? ”
28908	28918	28919	28919	I	49	“ Do n’t walk out of here like this . ”
28924	28933	28919	28919	I	49	“ It ’s only a half hour early . ”
28934	28941	28919	28919	I	49	“ You know what I mean . ”
28942	28947	28919	28919	I	49	“ I do n’t — ”
28948	28983	28919	28919	I	49	“ You walked past my office as if we were strangers . We ’re not . We have n’t had a chance to talk . I have n’t even had a chance to apologize . ”
28984	28989	28919	28919	I	49	“ Well … don’t . ”
28990	28994	28995	28995	he	77	“ Do n’t ? ”
29002	29015	28919	28919	I	49	“ Do n’t apologize . What do you have to apologize for ? ”
29016	29023	29024	29024	he	77	“ Let me start a list , ”
29032	29045	29046	29046	I	49	“ Your wife showed up , and that was that , Landon , ”
29056	29063	29046	29046	I	49	“ That is not what happened . ”
29113	29120	29107	29107	I	49	“ Just do n’t , okay ? ”
29160	29166	29167	29167	I	49	“ What are you doing ? ”
29176	29181	29167	29167	I	49	“ Having that talk . ”
29269	29277	29278	29278	I	49	“ This is not a good idea , ”
29306	29317	29300	29300	my	49	“ Everything about you is a good idea , Heidi . ”
29318	29324	29300	29300	my	49	“ You are my boss . ”
29325	29331	29300	29300	my	49	“ Yeah , I am . ”
29332	29352	29300	29300	my	49	“ My job is too important to me . I can’t … I do n’t want to do this . ”
29353	29361	29300	29300	my	49	“ Your job is n’t in jeopardy . ”
29362	29370	29371	29371	He	77	“ It is if you kiss me . ”
29419	29438	29407	29407	him	77	“ Next time I kiss you , it will be because you ’re asking me to , Heidi . ”
29439	29447	29448	29448	I	49	“ That ’s not going to happen , ”
29475	29482	29468	29468	I	49	“ Can I see you later ? ”
29483	29486	29487	29487	I	49	“ No , ”
29490	29501	29487	29487	I	49	“ Heidi , come on . Give me a chance . ”
29502	29513	29514	29514	I	49	“ I mean , no … I have a date , ”
29539	29543	29530	29530	Landon	77	“ A date ? ”
29544	29547	29530	29530	Landon	77	“ Yeah . ”
29548	29552	29530	29530	Landon	77	“ I see . ”
29553	29556	29557	29557	Landon	77	“ Yeah . ”
29620	29629	29630	29630	he	77	“ How long has that been going on ? ”
29639	29662	29630	29630	he	77	“ Dating ? My whole life . Some guys take me out for food . Maybe a movie . Pretty sweet deal , ”
29670	29677	29663	29663	I	49	“ You know what I mean . ”
29678	29683	29630	29630	he	77	“ A few weeks . ”
29684	29690	29663	29663	I	49	“ Since I left then ? ”
29691	29700	29701	29701	I	49	“ You had nothing to do with this , ”
29704	29711	29701	29701	I	49	“ Heidi , you ca n’t — ”
29712	29725	29726	29726	I	49	“ Do n’t tell me what I can and ca n’t do , ”
29731	29747	29726	29726	I	49	“ You made your decision , Landon , and now , I ’m making mine . ”
29961	29966	29967	29967	I	49	“ Hey , sexy , ”
29976	29982	29983	29983	Emery	533	“ Hello , my lover , ”
29989	29996	29983	29983	Emery	533	“ Still in major planning mode ? ”
29997	30001	30002	30002	she	699	“ The majorest , ”
30005	30011	30012	30012	She	699	“ Look what came today . ”
30046	30049	30050	30050	I	49	“ Great , ”
30068	30075	30076	30076	I	49	“ So , how was work ? ”
30081	30086	30087	30087	She	699	“ It was work . ”
30100	30106	30087	30087	She	699	“ You love your job . ”
30107	30124	30087	30087	She	699	“ Yeah , I do , but things have been … you know , rough lately . ”
30125	30140	30087	30087	She	699	“ Are you finally going to admit to me that this is about Landon ? ”
30141	30145	30146	30146	I	49	“ Absolutely not . ”
30205	30220	30198	30198	she	699	“ Fine . Then , how is it , having Landon as your boss ? ”
30221	30226	30227	30227	I	49	“ Weird as fuck , ”
30230	30265	30227	30227	I	49	“ I mean , I know he ’s a Wright , but we ’re the same age . I ’ve been doing this for six years , and he just dropped into the job . ”
30266	30280	30281	30281	I	49	“ Well , what do you expect when Jensen pulled strings for him ? ”
30291	30304	30284	30284	I	49	“ He ’s doing fine , but it ’s just … weird . ”
30305	30319	30227	30227	I	49	“ Weird because you ’re into him or because of the whole situation ? ”
30320	30323	30324	30324	I	49	“ Stop ! ”
30336	30349	30324	30324	I	49	“ It ’s because it ’s Landon . You should get that . ”
30350	30355	30356	30356	she	703	“ I get it , ”
30359	30381	30382	30382	She	703	“ But , when you ’re ready to tell me that you like him , I ’ll be here to listen . ”
30405	30414	30400	30400	she	703	“ Whatever . I have a date tonight . ”
30415	30420	30421	30421	Emery	533	“ Oh , right , ”
30428	30440	30421	30421	Emery	533	“ Sounds fascinating . The wonderful , drool - worthy Nick . ”
30441	30449	30400	30400	she	703	“ You ’re a shitty best friend . ”
30450	30498	30421	30421	Emery	533	“ Yeah , right . I ’ve known you since kindergarten . I know when you ’re playing along , and I know when you ’re invested . You ’re dating this Nick guy because Julia wants to have someone to hang out with her and Trevor . ”
30499	30505	30506	30506	I	49	“ But he is nice . ”
30513	30518	30519	30519	she	703	“ Nice ? Gross , ”
30527	30558	30519	30519	she	703	“ Whoever wanted nice ? Try passion and fire and need . You ca n’t settle for someone who is nice . You want someone you ca n’t live without . ”
30559	30568	30569	30569	Emery	533	“ Thank you , Queen of Bad Relationships . ”
30574	30594	30569	30569	Emery	533	“ Hey ! I might have had some bad relationships in the past , but I give good advice . ”
30595	30606	30519	30519	she	703	“ So , you think I should cancel with Nick ? ”
30607	30610	30611	30611	she	703	“ No ! ”
30614	30653	30654	30654	I	49	“ I think you should definitely go on a date with Nick . Then , you ’ll realize what you do n’t want . Because I already know it ’s not him . You seem oblivious to it . ”
31642	31646	31635	31636	The hostess	448	“ How many ? ”
31647	31658	31659	31659	I	49	“ I ’m just meeting some people at the bar , ”
31663	31672	31673	31673	she	448	“ Certainly , sir . Right over there , ”
31767	31770	31771	31771	I	49	“ Hey , ”
31780	31787	31788	31788	Austin	41	“ Hey . What ’s up ? ”
31791	31796	31797	31797	Patrick	632	“ Hey , man , ”
31800	31830	31797	31797	Patrick	632	“ Good to have you in town . I have n’t had a chance to see you around the office yet . Is it weird , working at Wright ? ”
31831	31838	31839	31839	I	49	“ Yeah , a little weird , ”
31887	31907	31876	31876	I	49	“ Well , Austin thinks you ’ll be playing golf again soon . We ’re all rooting for you . ”
31908	31911	31912	31912	I	49	“ Thanks , ”
31928	31935	31915	31915	I	49	“ Maker ’s Mark , neat . ”
31936	31941	31942	31942	she	218	“ You got it , ”
31950	31970	31971	31971	She	218	“ Oh , yeah . Landon , this is Mindi . Mindi , this is Austin ’s brother Landon . ”
31976	31990	31971	31971	She	218	“ Nice to meet you . You ’re the younger brother , right ? ”
31991	31995	31996	31996	I	49	“ I am , ”
31999	32006	31996	31996	I	49	“ Cute . I like brothers . ”
32067	32077	32078	32078	Patrick	632	“ Hear that , man ? She likes brothers . ”
32081	32090	32078	32078	Patrick	632	“ Yeah , whatever . I ’m down . ”
32111	32117	32118	32118	Patrick	632	“ You boys are silly . ”
32123	32129	32118	32118	Patrick	632	“ That , we are . ”
32130	32141	32142	32142	Austin	41	“ Hey , did you see your girl was here ? ”
32151	32156	32142	32142	Austin	41	“ My … girl ? ”
32189	32198	32199	32199	Austin	41	“ Yeah , dude . Check it out , ”
32306	32314	32315	32315	Patrick	632	“ Wait , what am I missing ? ”
32318	32334	32315	32315	Patrick	632	“ Who is Landon ’s girl ? God , help us all , not Miranda . ”
32335	32343	32344	32344	Austin	41	“ Nah , dude . Heidi Martin , ”
32411	32417	32403	32403	she	51	“ Who is she with ? ”
32438	32445	32446	32446	Patrick	632	“ So … you and Heidi ? ”
32451	32460	32446	32446	Patrick	632	“ Did n’t you date her best friend ? ”
32461	32471	32472	32472	I	49	“ Is n’t her best friend dating my brother ? ”
32515	32518	32519	32519	Patrick	632	“ Point , ”
32522	32532	32533	32533	Austin	41	“ Seriously , I do n’t get you two , ”
32536	32558	32533	32533	Austin	41	“ How can you let her go on a date with someone else ? Is this because of you and Miranda ? ”
32559	32562	32563	32563	I	49	“ No , ”
32567	32598	32563	32563	I	49	“ Well , are you going to go stop her ? Because I figured that , if you two were fucking , you would n’t let her date someone else . ”
32599	32606	32607	32607	Patrick	632	“ Whoa ! Nice , man ! ”
32623	32636	32607	32607	Patrick	632	“ Moving on from that bitch as fast as possible I see . ”
32637	32643	32644	32644	I	49	“ We ’re not fucking , ”
32648	32657	32658	32658	Austin	41	“ Well , except for that one time , ”
32664	32673	32674	32674	I	49	“ That is not what happened , dude , ”
32715	32718	32719	32719	Austin	41	“ Suuurrre , ”
32727	32735	32736	32736	Patrick	632	“ Well , this will be fun , ”
32759	32764	32751	32751	I	49	“ Hey , Mindi . ”
32765	32770	32739	32739	He	632	“ Yeah , babe ? ”
32771	32781	32782	32782	he	632	“ Can you send a drink to that table ? ”
32789	32795	32796	32796	I	49	“ What are you doing ? ”
32799	32809	32810	32810	Mindi	99	“ You ’re sending a drink to another girl ? ”
32819	32825	32826	32826	he	632	“ It ’s from Landon , ”
32830	32836	32837	32837	I	49	“ Do not do that , ”
32840	32847	32837	32837	I	49	“ That would look really bad . ”
32848	32855	32856	32856	Patrick	632	“ Ah , have some fun ! ”
32859	32873	32856	32856	Patrick	632	“ She looks miserable on her date anyway . She ’ll appreciate it . ”
32874	32884	32885	32885	she	51	“ Sure , honey . What should I send ? ”
32898	32903	32893	32893	I	49	“ No fucking way . ”
32904	32912	32913	32913	Patrick	632	“ A nice red wine will do , ”
32928	32950	32921	32921	Austin	41	“ Lighten up , Landon . Heidi is going to appreciate it . Look at how over this date she is . ”
33217	33224	33225	33225	I	49	“ You ’re such a dick , ”
33229	33241	33242	33242	Patrick	632	“ We ’re helping you . Are n’t we , Austin ? ”
33248	33255	33242	33242	Patrick	632	“ Meddling is a fun pastime . ”
33256	33272	33273	33273	Heidi	51	“ I ’ll remind you of that the next time I meddle in your business . ”
33322	33327	33328	33328	Patrick	632	“ Hey , Heidi ! ”
33359	33364	33365	33365	she	51	“ Hey , Patrick , ”
33372	33377	33365	33365	she	51	“ Austin . Landon . ”
33378	33381	33382	33382	Austin	41	“ Heidi , ”
33406	33416	33417	33417	her	51	“ Hey , y’ all . I ’m Nick , ”
33434	33439	33440	33440	Patrick	632	“ Hey , Nick , ”
33491	33496	33497	33497	Nick	61	“ Austin and Landon , ”
33504	33508	33509	33509	Austin	41	“ Wright brothers ? ”
33514	33517	33509	33509	Austin	41	“ Yep . ”
33518	33530	33531	33531	Nick	61	“ So , you all work for Wright Construction , too ? ”
33540	33548	33534	33534	Heidi	51	“ Yep . Landon is my boss . ”
33557	33560	33561	33561	Nick	61	“ Oh , ”
33596	33606	33607	33607	Patrick	632	“ You are n’t going to drink your wine ? ”
33639	33666	33634	33634	Heidi	51	“ We were already finished , and I ’m not feeling that well . So , I was going to forgo it . But … thanks . ”
33700	33712	33713	33713	Patrick	632	“ Well , you know what would make you feel better ? ”
33716	33727	33728	33728	she	51	“ A Xanax , ice cream , and some sleep ? ”
33744	33747	33748	33748	Patrick	632	“ Pool , ”
33756	33768	33769	33769	I	49	“ How would a swimming pool improve her well - being ? ”
33887	33891	33892	33892	I	49	“ Shooting pool , ”
33896	33920	33921	33921	Heidi	51	“ If you knew Heidi as well as I do , you ’d know it was one of her favorite things to do . ”
33928	33952	33953	33953	I	49	“ That ’s not exactly accurate . I would say one of my favorite things to do is kicking your ass in pool . ”
33956	33966	33953	33953	I	49	“ We ’ll see if you can do that . ”
33967	33982	33997	33997	Nick	61	“ I ca n’t even count the number of times I ’ve done that . ”
33983	33996	33997	33997	Nick	61	“ Wait , I thought you said that this was your boss , ”
34002	34010	34011	34011	Heidi	51	“ I … well … he is , ”
34016	34028	34029	34029	Patrick	632	“ Landon and Heidi have been friends for years , dude , ”
34032	34061	34062	34062	Nick	61	“ He ’s been her boss for a week . She can give him a pass for the night and play pool . You know where Flips is ? ”
34065	34073	34062	34062	Nick	61	“ I … yeah , I do . ”
34074	34083	34084	34084	Austin	41	“ What he ’s trying to say is , ”
34088	34108	34084	34084	Austin	41	“ we ’re going to head to Flips to play some pool if you ’d like to join us . ”
34109	34117	34118	34118	Heidi	51	“ Oh , I do n’t know , ”
34121	34132	34133	34133	Nick	61	“ I mean , these are your friends , right ? ”
34136	34152	34133	34133	Nick	61	“ I do n’t mind going with you if you ’re feeling up to it . ”
34153	34158	34084	34084	Austin	41	“ I do n’t — ”
34159	34165	34166	34166	I	49	“ Come on , Heidi , ”
34169	34185	34166	34166	I	49	“ It ’s only one game . Unless you ’re afraid I ’ll beat you . ”
34186	34205	34206	34206	I	49	“ The only time you ’ve ever won is when I let you to protect your precious ego . ”
34209	34216	34217	34217	She	51	“ You can prove that tonight . ”
34230	34258	34224	34224	he	61	“ I ’m up for it ! I did n’t even know you liked to play pool . I would love to see how good you are . ”
34259	34262	34263	34263	she	51	“ Right , ”
34266	34275	34276	34276	Austin	41	“ Great ! Then , it ’s settled , ”
34279	34296	34297	34297	Heidi	51	“ We ’ll see you there in twenty minutes . We just have to close out . ”
34375	34389	34390	34390	Nick	61	“ It was nice to meet some of your friends other than Julia , ”
34408	34423	34424	34424	I	49	“ I really need to meet your roommate now though . Emery sounds nice . ”
34443	34463	34464	34464	I	49	“ Yeah , we should invite her , too , and then we ’d have the whole gang together , ”
34468	34489	34464	34464	I	49	“ If you want to invite her , I do n’t mind . This has been the best date yet . ”
34556	34567	34568	34568	I	49	“ I think Emery is in with her boyfriend tonight , ”
34579	34587	34568	34568	I	49	“ Is n’t she dating a Wright ? ”
34588	34598	34552	34552	he	61	“ Yes , Jensen . He ’s the oldest . ”
34599	34633	34568	34568	I	49	“ So interesting . I do n’t know much about their family , just that they ’re , like , Lubbock royalty . Trevor is more into all that stuff than I am . ”
34634	34638	34639	34639	I	49	“ Lubbock royalty . ”
34642	34662	34639	34639	I	49	“ They ’re just people who happen to have money . I would n’t put them on a pedestal . ”
34824	34831	34832	34832	I	49	“ You ready to go in ? ”
35012	35017	35005	35005	I	49	“ You all right ? ”
35018	35021	35022	35022	I	49	“ Yeah , ”
35176	35184	35185	35185	he	58	“ You look like you need this , ”
35195	35213	35214	35214	I	49	“ Hey , Peter . Nice to see you . This is my … this is Nick , ”
35223	35228	35229	35229	Nick	61	“ Hey , man , ”
35251	35257	35236	35236	Peter	58	“ What ’ll you have ? ”
35258	35268	35269	35269	Nick	61	“ Oh , I ’ll take a Bud Light . ”
35388	35395	35396	35396	I	49	“ We ’re hitting the tables , ”
35526	35534	35535	35535	He	61	“ You ’re a mess , Austin . ”
35540	35556	35535	35535	He	61	“ Come now , Martin . This is n’t the worst you ’ve seen me . ”
35557	35563	35564	35564	Patrick	632	“ Not the best either . ”
35567	35574	35575	35575	Landon	533	“ This is definitely his best . ”
35690	35696	35697	35697	he	533	“ You ready to play ? ”
35706	35709	35710	35710	I	49	“ Um , ”
35713	35716	35710	35710	I	49	“ play ? ”
35717	35720	35721	35721	He	533	“ Pool . ”
35745	35754	35741	35741	he	533	“ Unless you have something else in mind . ”
35822	35826	35827	35827	I	49	“ Stop it , ”
35847	35851	35836	35836	He	533	“ Your break . ”
35885	35896	35867	35867	I	49	“ A hundred bucks says I beat you this game . ”
35914	35919	35897	35897	Landon	533	“ Fine by me . ”
35933	35941	35920	35920	Patrick	632	“ Now , we have a game ! ”
35979	35985	35986	35986	Landon	533	“ I presume your solids ? ”
35989	35994	35995	35995	I	49	“ You know it , ”
36019	36027	36028	36028	Nick	61	“ Wow , you are really good ! ”
36037	36053	36028	36028	Nick	61	“ Why did n’t you ever tell me that you could play pool like this ? ”
36054	36061	36062	36062	I	49	“ Just a fun party trick , ”
36065	36090	36062	36062	I	49	“ Well , I think it ’s pretty amazing . I ’m shit at pool . I ’ve only played once in my life . ”
36091	36096	36097	36097	I	49	“ Uh - huh , ”
36105	36114	36097	36097	I	49	“ Sorry kind of concentrating on the game . ”
36115	36125	36126	36126	Nick	61	“ Oh , yeah , sure . Go ahead , ”
36152	36165	36166	36166	he	61	“ What do you think ? Ten in the upper right corner ? ”
36172	36178	36179	36179	He	61	“ Your call , Landon . ”
36189	36201	36179	36179	He	61	“ We did n’t discuss what would happen if I won . ”
36202	36210	36211	36211	I	49	“ I give you a hundred dollars , ”
36224	36232	36219	36219	he	61	“ That ’s not what I want . ”
36233	36245	36246	36246	I	49	“ That ’s what you ’ll get … if you win , ”
36418	36425	36410	36410	he	61	“ You sure about that one ? ”
36449	36455	36438	36438	Landon	533	“ Trying to intimidate me ? ”
36460	36470	36438	36438	Landon	533	“ Of course not . Just helping my opponent . ”
36471	36489	36438	36438	Landon	533	“ You forget that I know you too well for that . You never help your opponent . ”
36490	36503	36504	36504	I	49	“ Sometimes , I do . When I want them to win , ”
36520	36529	36530	36530	His	61	“ And do you want me to win ? ”
36537	36540	36541	36541	He	61	“ No . ”
36544	36554	36541	36541	He	61	“ And I thought I was a shit liar . ”
36555	36562	36563	36563	Patrick	632	“ Come on , you two , ”
36571	36576	36563	36563	Patrick	632	“ Finish up already . ”
36577	36585	36586	36586	I	49	“ I ’d go with the twelve , ”
36596	36602	36586	36586	I	49	“ The twelve is impossible . ”
36603	36608	36563	36563	Patrick	632	“ Maybe for you . ”
36609	36626	36627	36627	His	61	“ Do you want to take this shot , or are you here as a distraction ? ”
36635	36643	36627	36627	His	61	“ I do n’t mind either way . ”
36644	36650	36651	36651	Nick	61	“ Yeah , y’ all , ”
36664	36671	36651	36651	Nick	61	“ Do n’t take all night . ”
36672	36680	36681	36681	Landon	533	“ Where did you find this guy ? ”
36694	36713	36687	36687	he	533	“ Well , he ’s not married . So , I think I ’ll call it a win . ”
36804	36811	36814	36814	him	533	“ Guess victory will be mine , ”
36898	36909	36910	36910	Nick	61	“ Come on , Heidi . You ’ve got this , ”
36913	36918	36919	36919	Austin	41	“ Yeah , Heidi , ”
36922	36933	36919	36919	Austin	41	“ I love watching you kick my brother ’s ass . ”
36934	36940	36941	36941	Landon	533	“ You ’re so thoughtful , ”
36944	36956	36941	36941	Landon	533	“ What ? It ’s hot when a chick beats you . ”
36957	36960	36961	36961	I	49	“ Hey , ”
36971	36979	36961	36961	I	49	“ I ’m not just some chick . ”
36980	36991	36992	36992	Patrick	632	“ You ’re right . You ’re a hot chick , ”
36995	37004	37005	37005	Landon	533	“ Ignore them , and call your shot , ”
37020	37027	37008	37008	I	49	“ Eight in the upper right . ”
37096	37099	37100	37100	I	49	“ Ugh , ”
37133	37138	37127	37127	I	49	“ Oh my God ! ”
37155	37163	37147	37147	Austin	41	“ Never doubted you for a second . ”
37169	37173	37164	37164	Nick	61	“ Great job ! ”
37183	37193	37174	37174	Patrick	632	“ Come on ! Let ’s go do shots ! ”
37217	37221	37209	37209	He	61	“ Nice game . ”
37222	37225	37226	37226	I	49	“ Thanks , ”
37265	37275	37257	37257	Patrick	632	“ It really was a great game , Heidi . ”
37276	37281	37246	37247	Heidi Landon	77	“ Piece of cake . ”
37282	37300	37257	37257	Patrick	632	“ Sure you do n’t want to find out what would have happened if I ’d won . ”
37301	37319	37320	37320	I	49	“ Do n’t think we ’ll ever know , Landon , because you ’ll never beat me , ”
37327	37330	37324	37324	He	61	“ Maybe . ”
37331	37343	37344	37344	I	49	“ Seriously , Landon , what the hell are you doing ? ”
37352	37358	37344	37344	I	49	“ Hanging out with you . ”
37359	37416	37324	37324	He	61	“ You ’ve been doing this whole I - know - you - so - well act tonight . And , sure , you might know me , but you ca n’t forget that I know you just as well , which means that I know you are not here just to hang out with me . ”
37417	37469	37324	37324	He	61	“ You ’re right . You do know me , Heidi . That ’s the point . You ’ve been avoiding me and walking away from me and refusing to listen to me all week when I ’ve been standing right in front of you , trying to make things right . ”
37470	37481	37324	37324	He	61	“ Maybe I do n’t want to make things right . ”
37482	37490	37491	37491	Landon	77	“ Why ? Because of this guy ? ”
37498	37546	37491	37491	Landon	77	“ The guy is so oblivious , he ca n’t even see what ’s right in front of his eyes . I could have made out with you on the pool table , and he would have clapped his hands and applauded at how good you are . ”
37547	37553	37554	37554	I	49	“ That is not true , ”
37557	37572	37573	37573	I	49	“ Fuck , I do n’t even want to get into this with you . ”
37596	37601	37583	37583	His	61	“ Heidi , stop . ”
37650	37693	37637	37637	I	49	“ I do n’t get what the hell you hope to accomplish here . Following after me and cornering me again ? That ’s not smart . Not only am I here with someone else , but you are also my boss . ”
37694	37705	37645	37645	he	61	“ Yeah , I am ! Who the fuck cares ? ”
37706	37710	37637	37637	I	49	“ I do ! ”
37711	37756	37637	37637	I	49	“ Well , Christ , Heidi , I know how important your job is to you . I get it . I ’m not trying to get you fired . And I do n’t think you would get fired even if someone found out . ”
37757	37804	37637	37637	I	49	“ You ca n’t possibly know that . That ’s such an incredibly naive way of thinking . Julia is one of my closest friends . I know that she has fired people or moved people to different branches of the company for less than this . ”
37805	37828	37829	37829	He	51	“ Less than what ? One kiss before I was your boss ? Because you keep telling me there ’s nothing here . ”
37837	37860	37829	37829	He	51	“ Or is it that there is something here ? And we are something more , but you refuse to acknowledge it . ”
37926	37938	37922	37922	I	49	“ What part of date do you not get , Landon ? ”
37946	37956	37957	37957	he	51	“ The part where you ’re not with me ! ”
37960	37965	37957	37957	he	51	“ You are married ! ”
37966	37987	37922	37922	I	49	“ Well , if you ’d just fucking talk to me , you would know that I ’m divorcing her ! ”
37988	37993	37994	37994	I	49	“ Wait … what ? ”
38000	38008	38009	38009	I	49	“ Yeah , I ’m leaving her ! ”
38014	38039	38009	38009	I	49	“ You said that last time , and you still went running back to her like a dog with his tail between his legs . ”
38040	38048	38049	38049	he	51	“ Is that what you think happened ? ”
38059	38122	38123	38123	My	49	“ Last time , we were separated . I ’d told her I was leaving her . And , now , I officially am , Heidi . I did n’t know she would be in town that day . I had no clue what kind of shit she was trying to pull . I ’m here trying to fix my fucking mistakes . ”
38131	38138	38123	38123	My	49	“ You ’re really leaving her ? ”
38139	38142	38143	38143	His	51	“ Yes . ”
38321	38326	38327	38327	he	51	“ Fuck , Heidi , ”
38429	38432	38409	38409	He	51	“ Landon … ”
38433	38440	38409	38409	He	51	“ Come back home with me . ”
38441	38446	38447	38447	I	49	“ I ca n’t , ”
38484	38495	38496	38496	he	51	“ This is what I wanted if I ’d won , ”
38499	38503	38496	38496	he	51	“ Just you . ”
38650	38653	38645	38645	I	49	“ No . ”
38654	38657	38658	38658	he	61	“ No ? ”
38665	38669	38658	38658	he	61	“ No what ? ”
38670	38677	38645	38645	I	49	“ This does n’t change anything . ”
38678	38685	38645	38645	I	49	“ What the hell , Heidi ? ”
38686	38702	38703	38703	I	49	“ You just dropping on me that you ’re leaving Miranda does n’t change anything , ”
38707	38740	38703	38703	I	49	“ Of course not . I tell you I ’m leaving my wife and that I want to be with you , and that means nothing to you ? Makes perfect sense . ”
38741	38756	38658	38658	he	61	“ But you have n’t left her yet ! You ’re still with her ! ”
38757	38776	38777	38777	he	61	“ Legally , we ’re separated . And in another couple of months , we ’ll be divorced , ”
38780	38818	38777	38777	he	61	“ You want to wait around for her to sign a document that I initiated and already signed . One that says our marriage is irretrievably broken and that we ’re unable to mend our irreconcilable differences . ”
38819	38866	38867	38867	Landon	77	“ I do n’t know , Landon . I do n’t know about any of that . It ’s all too much at once . I ’m on a date with someone else , and you ’re trying to seduce me . That ’s fucked up . ”
38993	38998	38999	38999	he	61	“ You ’re right , ”
39003	39007	38999	38999	he	61	“ I am ? ”
39008	39029	38999	38999	he	61	“ Yes . This was n’t what I wanted to happen . And I ’m sorry for ruining your date . ”
39030	39034	39035	39035	I	49	“ You are ? ”
39046	39055	39035	39035	I	49	“ I went about this the wrong way . ”
39061	39107	39056	39056	His	61	“ I do want this with you , Heidi , but I ’m not going to push you if you ’re not ready . If you want to wait until the divorce is finalized , then I can wait . I ’ll wait for you . ”
39249	39256	39231	39231	I	49	“ You ’ll wait for me ? ”
39257	39276	39277	39277	I	49	“ As long as you need . But just don’t … settle for that guy in the meantime . ”
39300	39321	39292	39292	He	61	“ I ’ll rally the troops and head out . I really do n’t want to hurt you , Heidi . ”
39386	39389	39390	39390	I	49	“ Landon , ”
39398	39401	39393	39393	he	61	“ Yeah ? ”
39402	39406	39407	39407	He	61	“ Thank you . ”
39420	39425	39426	39426	Austin	41	“ Hey , guys ! ”
39441	39458	39459	39459	I	49	“ You might want to break up the lovefest because homeboy is going to get suspicious . ”
39489	39494	39495	39495	Landon	77	“ It ’s fine , ”
39499	39505	39495	39495	Landon	77	“ We ’re heading out . ”
39506	39510	39511	39511	Austin	41	“ We are ? ”
39514	39521	39511	39511	Austin	41	“ Yeah . Let ’s go . ”
39522	39528	39529	39529	Landon	77	“ But what about Heidi ? ”
39553	39569	39570	39570	I	49	“ She collected her winnings . Maybe I ’ll come out on top another night . ”
39907	39912	39913	39913	Landon	533	“ It ’s open , ”
39954	39957	39958	39958	I	49	“ Hey , ”
39972	39975	39976	39976	he	533	“ Heidi , ”
39984	39988	39976	39976	he	533	“ Early morning ? ”
39989	39997	40005	40005	He	533	“ Christ , what time is it ? ”
39998	40001	40002	40002	I	49	“ Nine , ”
40013	40029	40005	40005	He	533	“ Yeah , early morning . I did n’t even know people were here yet . ”
40030	40037	39976	39976	he	533	“ When did you get in ? ”
40038	40048	40005	40005	He	533	“ Oh , I was here around six thirty . ”
40049	40054	40055	40055	He	533	“ In the morning ? ”
40058	40065	40055	40055	He	533	“ Yes , in the morning . ”
40066	40077	40005	40005	He	533	“ Whatever for ? We do n’t start until nine . ”
40156	40184	40142	40142	Landon	77	“ Well , I have physical therapy Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday afternoons and Monday and Friday mornings , so I come when I ’m finished . ”
40185	40189	40190	40190	My	49	“ Physical therapy ? ”
40196	40200	40190	40190	My	49	“ For what ? ”
40201	40210	40211	40211	he	77	“ Oh , we ’re asking questions now ? ”
40256	40269	40251	40251	He	77	“ I ’m kidding . I injured my back over the summer . ”
40270	40273	40274	40274	I	49	“ Again ? ”
40311	40314	40315	40315	he	77	“ Yes , ”
40360	40375	40376	40376	I	49	“ Well , I ’m glad you ’re taking care of it this time , ”
40380	40390	40376	40376	I	49	“ Me , too . It ’s long overdue . ”
40391	40394	40395	40395	I	49	“ So , ”
40398	40408	40395	40395	I	49	“ are you coming to Emery ’s party today ? ”
40409	40421	40376	40376	I	49	“ Already on the schedule to head out early for it . ”
40422	40430	40376	40376	I	49	“ Great . This should be fun . ”
40431	40442	40395	40395	I	49	“ You do know , she hates birthdays , right ? ”
40443	40454	40455	40455	I	49	“ Duh . It ’ll be more fun this way , ”
40462	40471	40472	40472	I	49	“ She ’s probably going to kill you . ”
40503	40515	40516	40516	Landon	533	“ Yeah , I ’m used to her telling me that . ”
40532	40540	40520	40520	my	49	“ Well , good luck with that . ”
40541	40544	40545	40545	I	49	“ Thanks , ”
40563	40573	40574	40574	I	49	“ Well , I ’ll leave you to it , ”
40587	40593	40574	40574	I	49	“ Thanks for stopping in . ”
40757	40762	40763	40763	I	49	“ Hey , sexy , ”
40773	40784	40785	40785	Julia	84	“ Do n’t use those moves on me , Martin , ”
40788	40794	40785	40785	Julia	84	“ My office . Now . ”
40803	40812	40798	40798	she	84	“ I hope I ’m not in trouble . ”
40813	40822	40823	40823	I	49	“ You ’re in a world of trouble . ”
40862	40888	40840	40840	She	84	“ What the hell happened with Nick ? You do n’t call . You do n’t write . You ca n’t fill a girl in ? ”
40889	40895	40840	40840	She	84	“ Did n’t work out . ”
40896	40924	40840	40840	She	84	“ What part of it did n’t work out ? Trevor was the one who told me . I think Nick is really beat up about it . ”
40925	40929	40930	40930	I	49	“ He is ? ”
40935	40953	40954	40954	Julia	84	“ He seemed totally fine when I let him down gently after our date on Friday night . ”
40962	40970	40954	40954	Julia	84	“ You dumped him on your date ? ”
40971	40989	40956	40956	her	84	“ Well , we were n’t really dating . So , I did n’t really dump him . ”
40990	41003	40954	40954	Julia	84	“ It was date three . I thought things were going somewhere . ”
41004	41011	40954	40954	Julia	84	“ I guess they were n’t . ”
41012	41028	41029	41029	I	49	“ Come on . Give me details . I thought this was a good thing . ”
41061	41080	41081	41081	Julia	84	“ I do n’t think it was a good thing . I think it was a convenient thing . ”
41084	41100	41081	41081	Julia	84	“ All right . Back to the drawing board . Maybe Trevor has another friend . ”
41101	41108	41109	41109	I	49	“ I do n’t think so , ”
41117	41129	41109	41109	I	49	“ Could you imagine me dating another one of his friends ? ”
41130	41133	41134	41134	she	84	“ No , ”
41137	41158	41159	41159	I	49	“ But I want you to be happy . It ’s a project of love to find you a man . ”
41164	41173	41174	41174	Julia	84	“ What if I just want your body ? ”
41181	41196	41174	41174	Julia	84	“ Do n’t tell Emery . She ’d be way jealous of our love . ”
41197	41203	41204	41204	I	49	“ That ’s a fact , ”
41207	41214	41204	41204	I	49	“ She ’s a jealous bitch . ”
41215	41241	41242	41242	I	49	“ With every right to be . You ’re an awesome friend and person , which is why I want to find you a guy . ”
41247	41254	41242	41242	I	49	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
41278	41286	41270	41270	she	84	“ What are n’t you telling me ? ”
41287	41290	41242	41242	I	49	“ Nothing . ”
41291	41299	41300	41300	Julia	84	“ You ’ve already found someone else ! ”
41308	41335	41300	41300	Julia	84	“ Look at how happy you are . Man , I am so excited . Who is he ? When do I get to meet him ? ”
41336	41339	41340	41340	I	49	“ Julia , ”
41343	41369	41340	41340	I	49	“ Do n’t hold out on me . Give me the goods . If there ’s someone new , I want to hear about it . ”
41370	41373	41374	41374	I	49	“ Okay , ”
41384	41393	41374	41374	I	49	“ But it ’s not a good idea . ”
41394	41398	41399	41399	I	49	“ Your favorite . ”
41408	41418	41403	41403	She	84	“ I kind of have this thing for Landon . ”
41419	41422	41423	41423	Julia	84	“ Landon , ”
41436	41442	41426	41426	Her	84	“ Like … Landon Wright ? ”
41443	41506	41507	41507	Julia	84	“ Yeah . We kind of made out at our ten - year high school reunion , and now , he ’s here , and he ’s into me . He happened to be at the same bar as Nick and me while we were on our date , and it was night and day . The connection is there with Landon . ”
41515	41523	41507	41507	Julia	84	“ Heidi , he is your boss . ”
41524	41528	41529	41529	I	49	“ I know , ”
41532	41542	41529	41529	I	49	“ He dated your best friend for two years ! ”
41543	41550	41507	41507	Julia	84	“ I know , I know . ”
41551	41570	41529	41529	I	49	“ What part of this is a good idea ? You can not have a connection with Landon ! ”
41571	41575	41576	41576	I	49	“ I know , ”
41623	41639	41507	41507	Julia	84	“ I do n’t think you know . This is a bad , bad idea ! ”
41640	41643	41644	41644	I	49	“ Julia , ”
41647	41661	41644	41644	I	49	“ Seriously , I do know how bad of an idea this is . ”
41662	41679	41507	41507	Julia	84	“ I am head of HR ! You ca n’t tell me these kinds of things ! ”
41680	41706	41644	41644	I	49	“ Nothing is going on , Julia . Plus , I told you about this as a friend , not as the head of HR . ”
41707	41712	41713	41713	she	845	“ Fuck , Heidi , ”
41726	41735	41736	41736	I	49	“ You have to stay away from him . ”
41739	41770	41736	41736	I	49	“ I told him the same thing on Friday night . He ’s my boss . He ’s going through a divorce . We ca n’t do this right now . ”
41771	41783	41716	41716	She	845	“ Good . Good . That ’s very mature of you . ”
41784	41808	41809	41809	Julia	84	“ Of course , I told him this after he hiked my leg up around his waist and started kissing up my neck . ”
41820	41829	41809	41809	Julia	84	“ La - la - la - la , ”
41859	41864	41865	41865	I	49	“ Okay , okay , ”
41873	41881	41865	41865	I	49	“ I ’ll stop talking about it . ”
41882	41936	41937	41937	I	49	“ Talking about it ? You ’re going to stop doing more than talking about it . You have to completely stop , or you know I ’ll have to figure out a way to separate you two . And who do you think they ’ll move — you or a Wright brother ? ”
42044	42056	42057	42057	Julia	84	“ Tell me you understand how important this is , Heidi , ”
42066	42074	42060	42060	Her	84	“ I ’m really worried about you . ”
42075	42085	42060	42060	Her	84	“ No , I get it . I do . ”
42086	42091	42060	42060	Her	84	“ Are you sure ? ”
42092	42095	42096	42096	I	49	“ Yeah , ”
42133	42138	42139	42139	Julia	84	“ Oh , fuck , ”
42147	42156	42142	42142	she	84	“ Just … just do n’t get caught . ”
42542	42545	42546	42546	I	49	“ Whoa , ”
42583	42592	42577	42577	Her	84	“ Oh , Landon ! You ’re early . ”
42635	42642	42643	42643	I	49	“ Need a hand with that ? ”
42646	42653	42643	42643	I	49	“ If you do n’t mind . ”
42654	42663	42643	42643	I	49	“ I ’m a bit taller than you . ”
42664	42669	42670	42670	I	49	“ Just a bit . ”
42725	42746	42747	42747	She	84	“ Thanks . I have a ton to do . So , it ’d be great if you could help . ”
42753	42762	42747	42747	She	84	“ That ’s what I ’m here for . ”
42763	42768	42769	42769	she	84	“ Great . Great , ”
42904	42911	42899	42899	Emery	533	“ Want me to do that ? ”
42925	42942	42916	42916	she	84	“ I ’m guessing you wo n’t be happy until we cover the room in them . ”
42956	42977	42943	42943	She	84	“ Yeah , I want Emery to try to stab me after seeing how over the top it all is . ”
42978	42984	42985	42985	I	49	“ This will definitely do , ”
42999	43014	42991	42991	Heidi	77	“ Thanks for your help . I still have a million things to do . ”
43015	43019	43020	43020	She	84	“ No problem . ”
43035	43038	43039	43039	Jensen	533	“ Landon ! ”
43046	43051	43039	43039	Jensen	533	“ You ’re early . ”
43052	43070	43039	43039	Jensen	533	“ Yeah , I thought I could help out . I knew Heidi had something big planned . ”
43071	43079	43080	43080	Jensen	533	“ It ’s good to see you . ”
43145	43155	43135	43135	I	49	“ Good to see you , too , man . ”
43156	43178	43135	43135	I	49	“ How is everything ? You ’ve been back for a while , and I feel like you ’re a stranger . ”
43179	43186	43187	43187	I	49	“ I was in church yesterday , ”
43213	43238	43210	43210	Jensen	533	“ Yeah , that ’s true . Just checking in on you . I ’m the oldest . What do you expect from me ? ”
43239	43269	43210	43210	Jensen	533	“ Nothing more than this . PT has been great though . I do n’t know how much progress I ’ve made , but the therapist is a goddess . ”
43270	43276	43210	43210	Jensen	533	“ I got the best . ”
43277	43287	43210	43210	Jensen	533	“ I can tell . She knows her shit . ”
43288	43292	43293	43293	Jensen	533	“ And Miranda ? ”
43340	43360	43361	43361	Jensen	533	“ Still getting texts from her every day , and she says she ’s refusing to sign the paperwork . ”
43364	43377	43361	43361	Jensen	533	“ I was afraid of that . She ’ll come around though . ”
43378	43384	43361	43361	Jensen	533	“ We can only hope . ”
43385	43391	43392	43392	I	49	“ And the new job ? ”
43487	43491	43492	43492	I	49	“ An adjustment , ”
43499	43547	43496	43496	Jensen	533	“ I knew it would be , but you ’ll make it work . You always do . I have to go get Emery now . Everyone should be arriving in the next couple of minutes . I ’ll see you when I get back with her . ”
43548	43553	43496	43496	Jensen	533	“ See you then . ”
43648	43651	43652	43652	she	443	“ Hey , ”
43660	43665	43652	43652	she	443	“ What ’s up ? ”
43673	43687	43666	43666	I	49	“ I hate to admit it , but I was kind of eavesdropping . ”
43724	43727	43716	43716	Jensen	533	“ And ? ”
43728	43738	43716	43716	Jensen	533	“ I ’m sorry . I should n’t have . ”
43739	43751	43752	43752	I	49	“ What did you hear that has you blushing so furiously ? ”
43783	43793	43770	43770	We	871	“ I think I ’m more embarrassed than anything . ”
43794	43798	43770	43770	We	871	“ About what ? ”
43799	43819	43770	43770	We	871	“ Well … I did n’t know if I should believe what you ’d said about Miranda on Friday . ”
43820	43824	43770	43770	We	871	“ What part ? ”
43825	43832	43833	43833	I	49	“ That you were divorcing her . ”
43858	43869	43770	43770	We	871	“ You thought I would lie about something like that ? ”
43870	43881	43770	43770	We	871	“ No . Not exactly . I was … cautious . ”
43882	43886	43887	43887	I	49	“ Cautiously pessimistic , ”
43933	43936	43937	43937	she	443	“ Optimistic , ”
43940	43944	43937	43937	she	443	“ But nervous . ”
43945	43949	43914	43914	she	443	“ And now ? ”
43950	43972	43937	43937	she	443	“ I believe you . I do n’t think Jensen would have asked if you ’d been lying about it all . ”
43973	43985	43986	43986	I	49	“ I ’m not going to lie to you , Heidi . ”
44057	44065	44066	44066	she	443	“ I ’m coming to realize that , ”
44258	44261	44262	44262	I	49	“ Heidi , ”
44265	44268	44262	44262	I	49	“ Hmm ? ”
44269	44274	44275	44275	Her	443	“ Look at me . ”
44308	44314	44315	44315	she	443	“ What are you doing ? ”
44318	44323	44315	44315	she	443	“ Falling for you . ”
44445	44455	44415	44415	she	443	“ You ca n’t fall for me , Landon . ”
44456	44466	44415	44415	she	443	“ It ’s too late . It ’s done . ”
44467	44472	44473	44473	she	443	“ Not good enough , ”
44476	44489	44490	44490	She	443	“ I ’m a goner , Heidi . Ca n’t you see ? ”
44586	44607	44608	44608	she	443	“ I think … I think you need time . I mean , I do n’t know what I think , ”
44611	44627	44608	44608	she	443	“ I do n’t need time . I ’ve had all the time I needed . ”
44628	44636	44637	44637	she	443	“ Well then , I need time , ”
44785	44789	44790	44790	Colton	111	“ Uncle Landon ! ”
44872	44879	44880	44880	I	49	“ You are getting so big , ”
44930	44938	44939	44939	Colton	111	“ I ’m turning into a man , ”
44950	44960	44944	44944	Heidi	77	“ Who did you come with ? Your nanny ? ”
44961	44980	44984	44986	Emery ’s sister	402	“ Nanny Jenn flew with me , but Aunt Kimber brought me and Lilyanne over for the party . ”
45022	45029	45030	45030	Kimber	113	“ Hey , Landon . Heidi , ”
45052	45058	45033	45033	She	402	“ Good to see you . ”
45059	45064	45065	45065	Heidi	77	“ Hey , Kimber , ”
45068	45077	45065	45065	Heidi	77	“ Are you all set for the party ? ”
45078	45093	45094	45094	I	49	“ Yeah , pretty much . Just waiting for everyone else to get here . ”
45132	45138	45139	45139	Kimber	113	“ And you , Landon , ”
45147	45163	45139	45139	Kimber	113	“ How are you holding up ? Emery told me you hurt your back again . ”
45164	45176	45177	45177	Kimber	113	“ Nothing some of your famous chocolate cake ca n’t fix . ”
45216	45226	45209	45209	She	113	“ Well , you have n’t changed a bit . ”
45436	45439	45433	45433	We	903	“ Happy Birthday ”
45454	45463	45464	45464	Colton	111	“ So , do we get cake then ? ”
45503	45511	45500	45500	Emery	533	“ Yes , we all get cake ! ”
45544	45573	45532	45532	Emery	533	“ Cupcakes in the morning , cookies in the evening , chocolate at suppertime . When Kimber ’s in the kitchen , you can eat baked goods anytime . ”
45574	45579	45580	45580	I	49	“ Oh my God , ”
45592	45604	45580	45580	I	49	“ I have not heard that song in a long time . ”
45605	45610	45611	45611	Kimber	113	“ You ’re lucky , ”
45614	45627	45611	45611	Kimber	113	“ Does she still sing it to you every time you bake ? ”
45628	45632	45580	45580	I	49	“ Often enough . ”
45633	45636	45637	45637	Emery	533	“ Hey , ”
45640	45651	45637	45637	Emery	533	“ it ’s a good song ! It ’s catchy . ”
45652	45668	45669	45669	Emery	533	“ It ’s a commercial jingle for Bagel Bites that you changed the words to . ”
45672	45679	45669	45669	Emery	533	“ And ? I ’m clever . ”
45680	45692	45693	45693	Jensen	533	“ Let ’s not argue with the birthday girl , huh ? ”
45934	45943	45944	45944	Austin	41	“ Nah , man , I ’m good . ”
45987	45997	45998	45998	she	48	“ Do you ever do anything other than drink ? ”
46001	46008	46009	46009	He	41	“ Why ? You want one ? ”
46025	46053	46020	46020	She	48	“ No , thanks . I ’m just glad we get to have this birthday party in peace without that bitch here . No offense , Landon . ”
46054	46062	46063	46063	I	49	“ Offense was intended but not taken , ”
46075	46086	46087	46087	Sutton	49	“ And she had to be one of my bridesmaids , ”
46090	46101	46087	46087	Sutton	49	“ You could n’t have divorced her before the wedding ? ”
46102	46128	46129	46129	Sutton	49	“ Well , if you had n’t gotten knocked up at twenty - one , then we could have probably fit it into your timetable . ”
46184	46190	46191	46191	she	116	“ I have no regrets , ”
46206	46218	46219	46219	Morgan	48	“ So , are you going to finish school or what ? ”
46237	46252	46253	46253	Morgan	48	“ Eh , why bother ? I want to stay at home with Jason . ”
46258	46270	46253	46253	Morgan	48	“ Sometimes , I do n’t know how we ’re sisters . ”
46271	46279	46280	46280	Sutton	49	“ You run the company , Morgan , ”
46290	46302	46280	46280	Sutton	49	“ I ’ll do my own thing . I always have . ”
46303	46310	46311	46311	Austin	41	“ That ’s for damn sure , ”
46314	46323	46311	46311	Austin	41	“ Do you remember that princess superhero outfit ? ”
46324	46328	46329	46329	Sutton	49	“ This again ? ”
46332	46338	46339	46339	I	49	“ It ’s pretty memorable , ”
46343	46351	46352	46352	Patrick	632	“ What is going on over here ? ”
46361	46369	46370	46370	Austin	41	“ Oh no , trouble is here , ”
46393	46396	46385	46385	Patrick	632	“ Ladies . ”
46397	46406	46407	46407	Morgan	48	“ You know you ’re late , right ? ”
46420	46426	46411	46411	Her	48	“ You missed the surprise . ”
46427	46442	46443	46443	Morgan	48	“ Yeah , sorry about that . I had to go pick up Mindi . ”
46449	46454	46455	46455	Patrick	632	“ Who is Mindi ? ”
46462	46488	46455	46455	Patrick	632	“ The guys will tell you . She ’s this bartender at West Table . We met when I was there for a business dinner . ”
46489	46493	46494	46494	Sutton	49	“ A girlfriend ? ”
46505	46508	46509	46509	Patrick	632	“ Uh , ”
46513	46527	46509	46509	Patrick	632	“ I mean … you know I do n’t do labels and shit . ”
46528	46533	46534	46534	I	49	“ There are children , ”
46547	46560	46561	46561	Patrick	632	“ Right . Sorry , dude . Oh , here she is . ”
46610	46616	46617	46617	she	48	“ Hey , y’ all ! ”
46620	46625	46617	46617	she	48	“ Austin . Landon . ”
46635	46638	46639	46639	Patrick	632	“ Hey . ”
46931	46936	46937	46937	I	49	“ Hey , wallflower , ”
46940	46948	46937	46937	I	49	“ What are you doing all alone ? ”
46949	46954	46955	46955	she	84	“ Oh , hey , ”
46968	46981	46937	46937	I	49	“ I did n’t realize I was making a spectacle of myself . ”
46982	47000	47001	47001	She	84	“ I do n’t think you are . I think I ’m the only one who noticed . ”
47018	47027	46937	46937	I	49	“ Well , thanks . I ’m fine . ”
47028	47043	47044	47044	She	84	“ Heidi Martin is not the kind of girl who is ever just fine . ”
47049	47056	47044	47044	She	84	“ Seriously , I ’m fine . ”
47057	47082	46937	46937	I	49	“ You usually take over the world in a group . Your personality can not be contained . But you do n’t seem happy . ”
47083	47088	47044	47044	She	84	“ I am happy . ”
47089	47092	47093	47093	She	84	“ Liar . ”
47097	47144	47093	47093	She	84	“ Well , I ’m happy for Emery . I ’m happy that she has her whole family here and her whole humongous new family here . Your family . I ’m so happy that there ’s so much love around her . She deserves that . ”
47145	47151	47152	47152	I	49	“ And you do n’t ? ”
47155	47163	47164	47164	She	84	“ I was n’t talking about me . ”
47180	47185	47174	47174	her	84	“ Were n’t you ? ”
47186	47195	47164	47164	She	84	“ It ’s silly . Forget about it . ”
47196	47212	47213	47213	I	49	“ It ’s not silly if you ’re upset . Talk to me , Heidi , ”
47217	47247	47248	47248	She	84	“ If we have anything at all , it ’s that we can talk to each other . You know that I ’m here . That I ’ll listen . ”
47265	47293	47294	47294	I	49	“ It ’s just … I do n’t have a family . So , sometimes , being around a family like yours is overwhelming . You know ? ”
47340	47344	47334	47334	Heidi	51	“ Overwhelming how ? ”
47345	47421	47424	47424	me	49	“ I do n’t know . Like … it ’s hard to be around all these people who know and love each other so much and not feel kind of … jealous . I feel horrible even thinking like that , but the only family I have is Emery . And then I see all of you together and Emery ’s family , who practically took me in , and I just … want that . ”
47467	47476	47477	47477	I	49	“ You ’re not alone , you know ? ”
47480	47492	47493	47493	she	51	“ Well , the family I do have does n’t count , ”
47497	47514	47515	47515	She	51	“ I was n’t talking about your dad , but we can if you ’d like . ”
47522	47540	47515	47515	She	51	“ I do n’t want to talk about him . He ’s in prison where he belongs . ”
47628	47640	47617	47618	Hank Martin	118	“ We can talk about your dad when you ’re ready . ”
47641	47648	47649	47649	she	51	“ Do n’t hold your breath , ”
47652	47738	47739	47739	I	49	“ In the meantime , you are not alone . Emery might be tried and true , but I ’m not going anywhere . You do n’t have to want a family like that when we ’re standing right in front of you , accepting you into the fold . It might take some getting used to . I know we ’re an … interesting bunch . But you never have to search for family again when you have mine right in front of you . ”
47856	47867	47840	47840	Heidi	51	“ You sure know how to calm a girl down . ”
47868	47874	47875	47875	Heidi	51	“ Just you , Heidi . ”
47878	47891	47875	47875	Heidi	51	“ Knowing your track record , I have to agree with that . ”
47892	47910	47840	47840	Heidi	51	“ Now , are you feeling better ? Want to come join the cool kids ’ table ? ”
47911	47919	47920	47920	I	49	“ Popularity is so overrated , Landon . ”
47938	48002	47931	47931	I	49	“ Come on , cheerleader . Get it moving . Jensen is going to start grilling soon , and you do not want to be over here , standing in his way , when he gets near a grill . Come grab a beer , and hang out with us . We do n’t bite . Well , I ca n’t guarantee Austin . ”
48090	48094	48075	48075	I	49	“ What for ? ”
48117	48137	48099	48099	He	119	“ Did n’t ask . Just said to do it . I ’m grabbing people as they get here . ”
48138	48142	48143	48143	I	49	“ All right , ”
48399	48404	48405	48405	I	49	“ Hey , Matt , ”
48415	48422	48423	48423	he	533	“ We meet again , Heidi , ”
48430	48441	48423	48423	he	533	“ Indeed . You know what this meeting is about ? ”
48442	48455	48423	48423	he	533	“ Nope . They never tell us anything before they want to . ”
48456	48464	48465	48465	I	49	“ Yeah , that ’s the truth . ”
48476	48485	48465	48465	I	49	“ At least they got us some breakfast . ”
48486	48498	48499	48499	I	49	“ I ’m surprised that you eat that kind of thing . ”
48516	48519	48520	48520	I	49	“ Huh ? ”
48523	48541	48542	48542	I	49	“ It ’s all processed flour and high fructose corn syrup . It ’s horrible for you . ”
48547	48551	48542	48542	I	49	“ Tastes delicious . ”
48552	48566	48542	48542	I	49	“ You should take care of your body . You only have one . ”
48567	48570	48571	48571	I	49	“ Noted , ”
48643	48648	48649	48649	Dennis	121	“ Is everyone here ? ”
48687	48695	48670	48670	I	49	“ I think we ’re missing Jim . ”
48696	48701	48702	48702	Dennis	121	“ Right , Jim , ”
48705	48739	48740	48740	He	121	“ Jim is taking a position at the Austin branch . His son just got into Texas , and he and his wife wanted to make the move to be close to him . ”
48843	48880	48881	48881	Dennis	121	“ So , with Jim clearing out his desk next week in the middle of the new city contract work , we ’re going to need to get someone prepped and into his job , pronto . ”
49010	49099	49100	49100	We	975	“ Company policy says that I have to leave the application up for a minimum of three days . That means you all have until next Wednesday to apply before I close the application entirely . Too much is resting on this project , and we need someone who knows what they ’re doing right away . So , I ’m not going to drag my feet on this . If you do n’t think you can handle it , then do n’t waste my time . Understand ? ”
49107	49124	49100	49100	We	975	“ Great . Now , get back to work . You ’re wasting time and money . ”
49161	49169	49170	49170	he	121	“ You seem awfully happy about this , ”
49173	49186	49170	49170	he	121	“ Yeah , well , I think it is a great opportunity . ”
49187	49192	49193	49193	He	121	“ You ’re applying ? ”
49198	49208	49193	49193	He	121	“ Um , yeah . Why would n’t I ? ”
49209	49221	49222	49222	I	49	“ You just have n’t been with the company that long . ”
49229	49249	49222	49222	I	49	“ Um … I’ve been with Wright for six years . Have n’t you only been here for four ? ”
49250	49278	49279	49279	he	121	“ Oh , yeah . I guess I forgot that I started after you . I did work for another company for four years before this though , ”
49297	49302	49279	49279	he	121	“ That ’s cool . ”
49388	49393	49394	49394	Matt	49	“ Hey , Heidi , ”
49411	49414	49415	49415	I	49	“ Hmm ? ”
49426	49446	49418	49418	I	49	“ So , I know , the last time we talked , you said that you were dating someone . ”
49457	49460	49418	49418	I	49	“ Yeah ? ”
49461	49475	49418	49418	I	49	“ Well , I heard through the grapevine that you ’re single again . ”
49476	49484	49485	49485	He	121	“ There ’s a grapevine for that ? ”
49492	49501	49485	49485	He	121	“ You know that people gossip around here . ”
49502	49506	49418	49418	I	49	“ I see . ”
49507	49539	49540	49540	I	49	“ Well , I was just wondering if you wanted to go out sometime . I ’m free tonight . We could go to Rain Uptown . I love their pasta . ”
49568	49582	49559	49559	I	49	“ Sorry , Matt , but I do n’t date in the office . ”
49583	49586	49587	49587	he	121	“ Oh , ”
49591	49595	49587	49587	he	121	“ I see . ”
49596	49619	49559	49559	I	49	“ It ’s a personal rule . Better not to mix business with pleasure and all that . You understand , right ? ”
49620	49632	49633	49633	he	121	“ Uh , sure . Yeah , it makes perfect sense , ”
50828	50834	50817	50817	Landon	533	“ Hey ! You showed . ”
50835	50841	50824	50824	his	533	“ I said I would . ”
50842	50861	50817	50817	Landon	533	“ Yeah , you did , but I was n’t sure . With , well … you know . ”
51031	51035	51036	51036	I	49	“ Nice place , ”
51051	51059	51040	51040	He	241	“ Yeah . Sure . Awesome digs . ”
51060	51068	51069	51069	I	49	“ It ’s not what I expected , ”
51087	51137	51073	51073	He	241	“ I ’m not bitter , I swear , but I went from living in a five - thousand - square - foot house in Clearwater with a pool and Jacuzzi , across from a PGA - regulation golf course , to this . This is … an adjustment . ”
51146	51151	51073	51073	He	241	“ Well , shit . ”
51152	51160	51040	51040	He	241	“ Pretty much my take on it . ”
51161	51181	51073	51073	He	241	“ Why did you pick this place ? It ’s not like you ca n’t live somewhere … better . ”
51182	51227	51073	51073	He	241	“ That ’s true . I could move again if I wanted . But , considering all the other changes in my life , I just wanted to go minimalist . I do n’t need the space . It ’s just me after all . ”
51228	51234	51040	51040	He	241	“ That makes sense actually . ”
51235	51254	51255	51255	Landon	533	“ I think it sounds better in my head than when I said it out loud to Jensen , ”
51264	51277	51258	51258	He	241	“ You want a drink ? Water ? Coke ? A beer ? ”
51278	51285	51286	51286	He	241	“ Coke is fine with me . ”
51375	51395	51396	51396	Landon	533	“ What did Jensen say when you told him you wanted a one - bedroom hole in the wall ? ”
51404	51419	51420	51420	I	49	“ You wound me . It ’s not actually a hole in the wall . ”
51423	51430	51420	51420	I	49	“ It ’s almost comically small . ”
51431	51448	51398	51398	his	533	“ Cut me a break . I did n’t see it before I signed the lease . ”
51449	51457	51420	51420	I	49	“ That was n’t a smart move . ”
51458	51461	51462	51462	he	533	“ Nope , ”
51465	51502	51420	51420	I	49	“ Anyway , Jensen thought I was overreacting to the whole divorce and moving away . That I did n’t need to live in a tree house to get that far away from my normal lifestyle . ”
51503	51509	51510	51510	I	49	“ He ’s not wrong , ”
51514	51530	51510	51510	I	49	“ He ’s not . But I ’m not living in a tree house either . ”
51545	51556	51531	51531	I	49	“ So , why were n’t you at work today ? ”
51557	51567	51568	51568	he	533	“ Ugh ! You want to talk about work ? ”
51587	51595	51571	51571	He	533	“ When I finally have you here ? ”
51596	51599	51600	51600	I	49	“ Finally ? ”
51607	51619	51600	51600	I	49	“ I ’ve never been invited to your tree house before . ”
51620	51642	51643	51643	His	533	“ I did n’t know that all I needed to do was send you an invite to get you over here . ”
51716	51728	51729	51729	I	49	“ I ’m not sure just any invite would have worked , ”
51775	51781	51782	51782	He	533	“ How about this one ? ”
51978	51983	51984	51984	I	49	“ Oh , fuck , ”
51988	51995	51984	51984	I	49	“ Fuck , shit , fuck . ”
51996	52003	52004	52004	he	533	“ Heidi , what ’s wrong ? ”
52030	52037	52024	52024	I	49	“ Stay . Stay right there . ”
52044	52047	52024	52024	I	49	“ Why ? ”
52048	52058	52024	52024	I	49	“ Because this only ends one way , Landon . ”
52059	52071	52024	52024	I	49	“ Hopefully , with you in my fucking bed , Heidi . ”
52072	52080	52024	52024	I	49	“ That is not going to happen ! ”
52081	52088	52089	52089	he	533	“ And why the fuck not ? ”
52092	52117	52118	52118	I	49	“ If the only reason I ’m here right now is because you want to fuck me , then I ’m going to leave , ”
52147	52157	52136	52136	Landon	533	“ No fucking way are you leaving right now . ”
52158	52162	52163	52163	Landon	533	“ Watch me ! ”
52169	52175	52163	52163	Landon	533	“ You ’re not leaving . ”
52176	52208	52136	52136	Landon	533	“ You ’re sadly mistaken if you think that , by inviting me to your tiny tree house , I ’ll give up all my reasons for staying away from you . ”
52267	52329	52257	52257	I	49	“ That ’s not what I think . I think you came over to talk to me about why I ’d missed work . Then , you looked at my mouth and licked your lips , and I could n’t sit next to you and lie to myself about wanting you . I ca n’t do what you ’re capable of . ”
52330	52351	52360	52360	he	1027	“ Yes , I want you . But I ca n’t have you . That ’s it . Full stop . ”
52352	52359	52360	52360	he	1027	“ I do n’t accept that , ”
52364	52368	52360	52360	he	1027	“ Learn to . ”
52369	52410	52257	52257	I	49	“ Are you just blind ? Is that what this is ? Do you think you can really avoid this forever ? Because I ’m not going anywhere , and what we have is n’t just going to go away . ”
52411	52419	52257	52257	I	49	“ What do we have , Landon ? ”
52425	52452	52257	52257	I	49	“ Some phone calls , a New Year ’s mistake , and two whole kisses ? That ’s not much as far as I ’m concerned . ”
52453	52460	52461	52461	His	1027	“ You ’re joking , right ? ”
52471	52534	52535	52535	he	1027	“ We ’ve been friends for , like , fifteen years , Heidi . You ’ve helped me more than you could possibly know during the last year . The only reason I stopped talking to you was because I was so into you , and I knew that I had to put distance between us . But let me be clear , ”
52544	52554	52535	52535	he	1027	“ there is no distance between us any longer . ”
52555	52561	52562	52562	I	49	“ Maybe there should be , ”
52653	52685	52642	52642	him	1027	“ No , you ’re wrong . You are fighting this because of work . But I was yours before that , and I ’ll be yours after it , too . ”
52686	52713	52714	52714	I	49	“ That does n’t change the fact that you ’re my boss though . Fuck , I do n’t even know why you ’re my boss , ”
52717	52727	52714	52714	I	49	“ Well , you refused to listen to me . ”
52742	52774	52775	52775	Landon	533	“ I ’m listening now . I came here to listen to you . For you to tell me why you ’d missed work . Not for you to kiss me ! ”
52834	52839	52840	52840	he	533	“ Okay , Heidi , ”
52863	52877	52850	52850	he	533	“ We ’ll play it your way . I wo n’t kiss you . ”
52892	52901	52902	52902	He	533	“ Then … we’re not doing anything wrong . ”
52946	52952	52953	52953	I	49	“ This is n’t helping , ”
52959	52971	52972	52972	he	533	“ You mean … even when I ’m not kissing you , ”
52990	52999	52972	52972	he	533	“ even when I ’m not touching you … ”
53044	53062	53063	53063	I	49	“ You still have feelings for me ? You still want me ? You still want this ? ”
53074	53103	53063	53063	I	49	“ Because , if you still want me , then it ’s not going to go away . It ’s just going to build . Until it explodes . ”
53114	53126	53127	53127	he	533	“ Tell me you want this as much as I do , ”
53132	53166	53127	53127	he	533	“ Tell me this is n’t a lost cause . I can see you do n’t want me to stop . Just tell me you want this . Stop telling me to stop . ”
53177	53182	53185	53185	he	533	“ Do n’t stop . ”
53603	53606	53607	53607	she	51	“ Oh , ”
53611	53614	53607	53607	she	51	“ What ? ”
53660	53668	53669	53669	she	51	“ You should always walk around shirtless , ”
53684	53688	53672	53672	I	49	“ Duly noted . ”
53689	53698	53699	53699	She	51	“ Might be an issue at the office . ”
53717	53726	53699	53699	She	51	“ I ’m willing to take the risk . ”
53727	53735	53736	53736	My	49	“ I ’ll risk everything for you . ”
53890	53893	53894	53894	she	51	“ Landon , ”
54097	54100	54101	54101	I	49	“ Heidi , ”
54109	54114	54101	54101	I	49	“ I want you . ”
54115	54118	54092	54092	she	1036	“ Yes . ”
54119	54126	54101	54101	I	49	“ I want all of you . ”
54127	54130	54101	54101	I	49	“ Please . ”
54131	54138	54139	54139	I	49	“ No going back from here , ”
54158	54163	54150	54150	I	49	“ Oh , fuck ! ”
54228	54231	54232	54232	she	1036	“ Landon , ”
54235	54239	54232	54232	she	1036	“ oh God . ”
54250	54257	54232	54232	she	1036	“ Was this what you wanted ? ”
54258	54263	54232	54232	she	1036	“ God , yes . ”
54264	54275	54276	54276	She	1036	“ Where did all of that anger go , firecracker ? ”
54319	54329	54308	54308	Heidi	51	“ Nothing to be mad at me about now ? ”
54335	54343	54344	54344	she	51	“ Landon , so help me God , ”
54435	54441	54442	54442	she	51	“ That was … fuck , ”
54449	54456	54442	54442	she	51	“ That was just the appetizer . ”
54486	54491	54483	54483	I	49	“ Is this okay ? ”
54553	54561	54550	54550	she	51	“ This is way more than okay . ”
54568	54586	54562	54562	I	49	“ Good . That was what I thought your screams meant , but I was n’t sure . ”
54587	54590	54562	54562	I	49	“ Fucker . ”
54591	54595	54596	54596	I	49	“ Excuse me ? ”
54615	54624	54625	54625	I	49	“ I said , you ’re a fucker . ”
54639	54644	54625	54625	I	49	“ What was that ? ”
54645	54648	54651	54651	she	51	“ More , ”
54984	54989	54970	54970	I	49	“ Oh , Heidi , ”
55006	55014	55002	55002	She	51	“ I ca n’t feel my legs . ”
55015	55021	55002	55002	She	51	“ Am I crushing you ? ”
55022	55031	55002	55002	She	51	“ No , I think you killed me . ”
55032	55038	55039	55039	I	49	“ In a good way ? ”
55045	55051	55052	55052	I	49	“ In the best way . ”
55088	55094	55095	55095	she	51	“ Watch it , fucker , ”
55102	55111	55095	55095	she	51	“ Yes , I did just fuck her . ”
55183	55196	55178	55178	She	51	“ I can not believe I just had sex with my boss . ”
55205	55226	55178	55178	She	51	“ You and your titles . I think you just had sex with me . The rest does n’t matter . ”
55227	55230	55178	55178	She	51	“ Maybe . ”
55231	55242	55243	55243	I	49	“ Are you going to be all right with this ? ”
55264	55282	55257	55257	she	51	“ Are you kidding ? All right ? We should have done this a long time ago . ”
55290	55302	55257	55257	she	51	“ That ’s what I ’ve been trying to tell you . ”
55303	55316	55317	55317	she	51	“ That was a really fun way of avoiding my questions earlier , ”
55330	55355	55257	55257	she	51	“ Oh , Heidi , that was not to avoid anything . That was for fun , and frankly , it was long overdue . ”
55356	55359	55360	55360	she	51	“ Mmm , ”
55404	55416	55395	55395	we	1043	“ So , why were you out of work today then ? ”
55417	55422	55395	55395	we	1043	“ Doctor ’s appointment . ”
55423	55428	55395	55395	we	1043	“ For your back ? ”
55429	55432	55395	55395	we	1043	“ Yeah . ”
55433	55444	55445	55445	I	49	“ Are you going to tell me the whole story ? ”
55451	55519	55445	55445	I	49	“ Yeah . So , I went pro right out of college and qualified for the PGA my first year out . It was a pretty big deal . I mean , I know you followed some of it , but they thought , in a few years , I would be a shoo - in for a Masters win and maybe even the whole FedEx Cup . ”
55520	55537	55395	55395	we	1043	“ I remember some of that . It was right when I started working for Wright . ”
55538	55581	55445	55445	I	49	“ Yeah . So , about two years into my career , I fucked up my back . All the doctors said there was no way I could play on it . I needed to drop out and go on medical exemption . ”
55582	55588	55445	55445	I	49	“ But you did n’t . ”
55589	55612	55613	55613	Her	1044	“ Nope . I played through the pain . Got doped up on pain meds the doctor prescribed and pushed through it . ”
55624	55630	55613	55613	Her	1044	“ That stuff is super addicting ”
55631	55637	55646	55646	she	1044	“ I ’m well aware . ”
55638	55645	55646	55646	she	1044	“ Did you keep taking them ? ”
55653	55660	55661	55661	I	49	“ Are you taking them now ? ”
55685	55688	55689	55689	I	49	“ No , ”
55693	55740	55689	55689	I	49	“ It was a stupid mistake to keep going when I should have taken a break . I was so high on the game . I stopped taking the prescriptions and tried to heal in the off season . And I have n’t taken it since . ”
55741	55744	55745	55745	she	1044	“ Never ? ”
55748	55756	55757	55757	She	1044	“ Nope . Not worth the risk . ”
55765	55768	55757	55757	She	1044	“ Good . ”
55769	55860	55689	55689	I	49	“ Anyway , fast forward three years . Something else tweaked in my back , but my doctor gave me the all clear after a couple of weeks . But this summer was the worst . I over rotated . I think I must have put all the pressure into my lower back , and that ’s when it was all over . The doctor said I needed surgery and a minimum of a year recovery , and even then , I might never golf again , ending my career . ”
55861	55866	55867	55867	she	1044	“ Oh my God , ”
55885	55903	55689	55689	I	49	“ So … you’re working for Wright because you do n’t think you ’ll ever golf again ? ”
55904	55969	55757	55757	She	1044	“ I have hope that I will be able to golf again , but I ’m working for Wright while I ’m in physical therapy to try to keep my mind from going crazy . I need something to focus on and something to believe in or else I worry that the mental part of my game will disintegrate if … when I return . ”
55970	55973	55974	55974	she	1044	“ Shit , ”
55977	55984	55757	55757	She	1044	“ That ’s just … awful . ”
55985	55991	55992	55992	I	49	“ What ’s worse is , ”
55998	56048	56049	56049	Heidi	51	“ when I got the news , instead of responding as you just did … as most normal human beings would , Miranda told me I could n’t risk ending my career because of a little pain . I think her exact words were , ‘ Fuck integrity . ’ ”
56052	56056	56049	56049	Heidi	51	“ How awful . ”
56057	56120	56049	56049	Heidi	51	“ Yeah . Then I caught her telling one of her friends that she did n’t want to have kids after we spent the last year in marriage counseling after she miscarried . I ’d been planning to divorce her before she got pregnant , but I tried to make it work . Then it was just a slap in the face . ”
56121	56124	56125	56125	Heidi	51	“ Wow , ”
56128	56136	56137	56137	I	49	“ Was that right before the reunion ? ”
56140	56169	56137	56137	I	49	“ That ’s when I left her . She ’d used up her last chance with me , and I was done . Then , there you were . ”
56179	56249	56253	56253	Heidi	51	“ My little firecracker . And I realized how stressful my life had become and how much I was hurting emotionally , mentally , and physically . But you and I had always been right . We had always been open and honest with each other . Our connection ran deep . And , suddenly , everything in the world made sense . I wanted you and only you . ”
56445	56448	56431	56431	Landon	533	“ Morning . ”
56449	56453	56454	56454	I	49	“ Good morning , ”
56463	56471	56472	56472	I	49	“ You look gorgeous in the morning . ”
56475	56482	56472	56472	I	49	“ Uh , yeah . Sure . ”
56483	56492	56472	56472	I	49	“ Most beautiful thing I ’ve ever seen . ”
56493	56498	56472	56472	I	49	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
56499	56502	56503	56503	he	533	“ Mmm , ”
56529	56532	56516	56516	He	533	“ Shit . ”
56533	56536	56537	56537	I	49	“ What ? ”
56542	56547	56537	56537	I	49	“ Uh … nothing . ”
56548	56553	56516	56516	He	533	“ Nothing , huh ? ”
56554	56568	56537	56537	I	49	“ I just … think I did something to my back last night . ”
56569	56577	56578	56578	I	49	“ You think , or you did ? ”
56592	56606	56586	56586	His	533	“ I did , but it ’ll be fine . Do n’t worry . ”
56607	56619	56620	56620	He	533	“ Do you need help ? Or , like , Tylenol ? ”
56631	56643	56644	56644	I	49	“ I guess we were a little too vigorous last night . ”
56647	56653	56644	56644	I	49	“ You could say that . ”
56654	56663	56644	56644	I	49	“ It was probably when I lifted you . ”
56664	56671	56672	56672	I	49	“ Oh , shit . Yeah , ”
56706	56729	56700	56700	I	49	“ You need to take better care of yourself . Jesus . Let me get you something . What do you have ? ”
56730	56756	56757	56757	I	49	“ There ’s some Tylenol and a muscle relaxer over the toilet if you want to grab me some along with a glass of water . ”
56823	56827	56828	56828	Landon	533	“ Find it ? ”
56831	56839	56828	56828	Landon	533	“ Yep . It ’s right here . ”
56852	56857	56858	56858	I	49	“ Here you go , ”
56868	56871	56872	56872	He	533	“ Thanks . ”
56881	56890	56891	56891	He	533	“ I think I ’m dehydrated , too . ”
56898	56908	56891	56891	He	533	“ Did you have anything to do with that ? ”
56917	56923	56909	56909	I	49	“ Nope . Not me . ”
56924	56932	56933	56933	he	533	“ Why do n’t I believe you ? ”
56941	56948	56933	56933	he	533	“ Because I was totally involved . ”
57067	57078	57079	57079	I	49	“ Oh my God , I have to go home , ”
57097	57106	57079	57079	I	49	“ I have a girls ’ night tonight . ”
57107	57112	57113	57113	Landon	533	“ Do n’t go , ”
57137	57144	57116	57116	He	533	“ Just stay one more night . ”
57145	57150	57151	57151	I	49	“ I ca n’t , ”
57155	57160	57151	57151	I	49	“ I promised Em . ”
57161	57169	57170	57170	His	533	“ Have a girls ’ night tomorrow . ”
57197	57209	57177	57177	he	533	“ Ca n’t . As much as I want to stay — ”
57210	57215	57177	57177	he	533	“ Then , stay . ”
57216	57223	57177	57177	he	533	“ Oh , you are trouble . ”
57224	57227	57228	57228	he	533	“ Yes , ”
57243	57251	57232	57232	I	49	“ You ’re making this really difficult . ”
57252	57260	57261	57261	I	49	“ I never promised to fight fair . ”
57264	57271	57261	57261	I	49	“ That ’s for damn sure . ”
57272	57280	57281	57281	he	533	“ When will I see you again ? ”
57290	57298	57281	57281	he	533	“ I do n’t know . Tomorrow ? ”
57299	57302	57303	57303	His	533	“ Good . ”
57310	57316	57303	57303	His	533	“ Tomorrow is a promise . ”
57325	57330	57303	57303	His	533	“ I like that . ”
57331	57339	57281	57281	he	533	“ Are you going to tell Em ? ”
57340	57343	57344	57344	I	49	“ Yeah , ”
57351	57373	57344	57344	I	49	“ Ca n’t hide anything from her . Plus , anyway , she guessed what was going on back in December . ”
57374	57381	57382	57382	Landon	533	“ Of course , she did . ”
57392	57402	57382	57382	Landon	533	“ You sure you ca n’t tell her tomorrow ? ”
57414	57422	57423	57423	He	533	“ I ’ll miss you , too . ”
57563	57568	57569	57569	Emery	533	“ You ’re back ! ”
57576	57585	57569	57569	Emery	533	“ I thought maybe you ’d ditched me . ”
57586	57606	57607	57607	Emery	533	“ Nope . I remembered girls ’ night . Just going to get into something a little more comfortable . ”
57619	57627	57607	57607	Emery	533	“ Why are you wearing work clothes ? ”
57628	57635	57569	57569	Emery	533	“ That ’s an excellent question . ”
57636	57644	57607	57607	Emery	533	“ Actually , where were you anyway ? ”
57645	57651	57652	57652	I	49	“ Also a good question . ”
57704	57710	57688	57688	she	1060	“ Avoiding the questions much ? ”
57711	57714	57715	57715	I	49	“ No , ”
57719	57726	57727	57727	She	1060	“ You got another letter today . ”
57759	57762	57763	57763	I	49	“ Thanks , ”
57781	57787	57778	57778	Emery	533	“ Are you going to … ”
57788	57791	57792	57792	I	49	“ No , ”
57801	57806	57792	57792	I	49	“ I ’m not . ”
57807	57810	57811	57811	she	1060	“ K , ”
57822	57846	57815	57815	She	1060	“ So , spill where you were and what you were doing . Or else I ’ll make you talk about the letters . ”
57847	57852	57853	57853	I	49	“ Okay , okay , ”
57863	57870	57853	57853	I	49	“ I was … with Landon . ”
57871	57876	57877	57877	she	1060	“ I KNEW IT ! ”
57902	57911	57896	57896	I	49	“ I did n’t even say anything else . ”
57912	57946	57947	57947	Emery	533	“ Well , you ’re finally fucking admitting to me that you ’re into Landon . I ’ve been waiting for this for months . So , are you like together , together ? ”
57950	57981	57982	57982	Emery	533	“ Emery , I do not understand you . Why are you so excited about this ? You dated Landon for two years . I was terrified of telling you . ”
57993	58078	57982	57982	Emery	533	“ Besides the fact that I ’m dating his brother ? I think I got over my anger at the Wrights because of Jensen . We were kids , Heidi . Landon left me because he thought he was doing the right thing by his dad . I did n’t understand that at the time , but ten years gives you a lot of perspective . I do not begrudge you dating him , like I might have right after high school or something . ”
58079	58099	58109	58109	she	1062	“ I guess that makes sense . I mean … I still feel weird , telling you about it . ”
58100	58108	58109	58109	she	1062	“ You have n’t told me anything , ”
58123	58141	58109	58109	she	1062	“ Tell me all the details . I think we need ice cream and bubbles to celebrate . ”
58142	58149	58150	58150	I	49	“ Oh , champs , yes ! ”
58153	58156	58157	58157	Emery	533	“ Champs ? ”
58160	58194	58195	58195	I	49	“ You are so Real Housewives right now . Oh my God , I hate myself for knowing that . Damn Morgan and her obsession with those kinds of shows and trash magazines . ”
58198	58210	58195	58195	I	49	“ Does she still watch just to make fun of people ? ”
58211	58237	58195	58195	I	49	“ Yes , though I think she ’s secretly obsessed . Anyway , enough about Morgan . Tell me about Landon . You ’re together ? ”
58238	58260	58195	58195	I	49	“ Yes . Well , no . I mean , not technically since he ’s in the middle of a divorce . ”
58261	58269	58195	58195	I	49	“ Oh , thank fuck about Miranda . ”
58270	58283	58284	58284	I	49	“ And there ’s the whole issue with him being my boss , ”
58288	58303	58304	58304	She	1064	“ Oh , right . You have that no - dating - coworkers thing . ”
58335	58361	58320	58320	I	49	“ Julia said that I ’d probably get moved if something happened since he ’s a Wright . But do not say anything to Jensen . ”
58362	58367	58368	58368	Emery	533	“ Ugh , seriously ? ”
58377	58412	58368	58368	Emery	533	“ I do n’t want Jensen to know . We ’ll get in trouble , and I think I ’m in line for a promotion . I ’ve worked so hard for this job . ”
58413	58416	58417	58417	Emery	533	“ Okay , ”
58420	58438	58417	58417	Emery	533	“ I understand that . You got yourself where you are today . But what about Landon ? ”
58439	58452	58453	58453	I	49	“ If he wanted to move … he would have asked already , ”
58459	58474	58453	58453	I	49	“ So , you ’re going to wait for him to make the move ? ”
58475	58483	58484	58484	Emery	533	“ I ’m not jeopardizing my career . ”
58487	58512	58484	58484	Emery	533	“ I ’m not saying to . I ’m saying , if it bothers you this much , then talk to him about it . ”
58513	58572	58453	58453	I	49	“ I have . He knows how I feel about him being my boss , but he got this job for a reason . I do n’t know what to do . I do n’t want to tell him to get a new job when our relationship is just starting , and he ’s going through so much . ”
58573	58592	58453	58453	I	49	“ Well , if it get serious , then you ’re going to have to talk about it . ”
58593	58596	58597	58597	I	49	“ Yeah , ”
58680	58683	58684	58684	Emery	533	“ Sorry , ”
58687	58700	58701	58701	I	49	“ I want you to be happy . Landon makes you happy ? ”
58704	58707	58701	58701	I	49	“ Very . ”
58708	58719	58701	58701	I	49	“ Good . Even if it is a little weird . ”
58720	58725	58726	58726	I	49	“ I knew it ! ”
58729	58737	58738	58738	Emery	533	“ I knew you were weirded out . ”
58744	58764	58738	58738	Emery	533	“ Nah . I ’m joking . Now , the really important question . Mean Girls or Bad Moms ? ”
58765	58774	58738	58738	Emery	533	“ I ’m going to go with both . ”
58775	58779	58738	58738	Emery	533	“ Good choice . ”
58924	58933	58915	58915	he	533	“ You ’re worried about being out together ? ”
58934	58940	58941	58941	I	49	“ I mean … yeah , ”
58944	58951	58941	58941	I	49	“ You ’re still my boss . ”
58952	58956	58957	58957	My	49	“ I know . ”
58964	58978	58979	58979	Landon	533	“ Could n’t you just … ask Jensen or Morgan to move you ? ”
58984	58989	58979	58979	Landon	533	“ I did already . ”
58990	58993	58994	58994	I	49	“ What ? ”
58997	59017	58994	58994	I	49	“ Yeah . The first day I saw you , I went to ask Morgan for a different job . ”
59018	59025	58979	58979	Landon	533	“ I did n’t know that ! ”
59026	59050	58994	58994	I	49	“ Well , I did n’t want you to think that I was out of line when you were still angry with me . ”
59051	59057	59058	59058	Landon	533	“ What did Morgan say ? ”
59061	59108	59109	59109	I	49	“ She had to restructure the company to get me into this position . There is no other position for me right now . Nothing I ’m qualified for at least . The job that I have is it for me until something else opens up . ”
59118	59121	59109	59109	I	49	“ Wow . ”
59122	59128	59109	59109	I	49	“ Yeah , I know . ”
59129	59140	59109	59109	I	49	“ Well , I guess that ’s off the table . ”
59141	59156	59157	59157	He	533	“ For now , Heidi , but not forever . We can handle this . ”
59164	59168	59157	59157	He	533	“ I promise . ”
59186	59189	59190	59190	he	533	“ Hey , ”
59197	59214	59190	59190	he	533	“ we can handle this . I swear . I am with you one hundred percent . ”
59215	59219	59220	59220	I	49	“ I know , ”
59315	59318	59319	59319	he	533	“ Heidi , ”
59338	59345	59319	59319	he	533	“ let ’s talk about this . ”
59346	59354	59355	59355	I	49	“ What ’s there to talk about ? ”
59358	59361	59362	59362	he	533	“ Please , ”
59367	59371	59372	59372	I	49	“ All right , ”
59431	59436	59437	59437	Miranda	84	“ Hello , darling , ”
59530	59533	59534	59534	Heidi	51	“ Oh , ”
59543	59562	59537	59537	Her	51	“ I ’m just … going to go back to my desk then . Good talk , boss . ”
59563	59566	59567	59567	I	49	“ Heidi , ”
59571	59581	59584	59584	she	51	“ We ’ll chat about that … thing later . ”
59604	59613	59614	59614	I	49	“ What are you doing here , Miranda ? ”
59617	59628	59629	59629	I	49	“ I came to see my husband , of course . ”
59742	59751	59752	59752	I	49	“ Are you going to sign the papers ? ”
59824	59838	59839	59839	My	49	“ Do we have to talk about that silly document you sent me ? ”
59843	59864	59865	59865	She	1735	“ I ’m at work . Either you ’re here to sign the paperwork or you ’re going to leave . ”
59889	59904	59884	59884	she	1735	“ I flew all the way here , and you ’re kicking me out ? ”
59905	59908	59909	59909	I	49	“ Yes , ”
59913	59920	59909	59909	I	49	“ I thought we could talk . ”
59921	59941	59942	59942	She	1735	“ Please , just stop this , Miranda . Just sign the divorce forms and get this over with . ”
60032	60050	60051	60051	She	1735	“ But I do n’t want to get this over with . I want you , Landon . ”
60064	60074	60058	60058	I	49	“ What part of divorce are you not comprehending ? ”
60075	60101	60102	60102	I	49	“ The part where we got married and said our wedding vows . I took those seriously , Landon . I guess you did n’t . ”
60116	60122	60123	60123	I	49	“ I took them seriously , ”
60127	60166	60123	60123	I	49	“ You know I meant those words when I said them , but things have changed . We ’ve changed . I think it will be better for both of us if we move on with our lives . ”
60167	60176	60177	60177	she	1735	“ I ca n’t just stop loving you , ”
60247	60255	60235	60235	our	1083	“ We ’re not having this conversation . ”
60256	60262	60263	60263	she	1735	“ Yes , we are , ”
60267	60285	60263	60263	she	1735	“ I ’m afraid not . I have work to do . And you should go home . ”
60286	60297	60298	60298	Miranda	84	“ How can I go home to an empty house ? ”
60323	60329	60309	60309	she	84	“ Why should I care ? ”
60330	60337	60263	60263	she	1735	“ Because I ’m your wife ! ”
60338	60351	60309	60309	she	84	“ And , soon , you ’ll be my ex - wife . ”
60352	60360	60361	60361	she	1735	“ How can you be so uncaring ? ”
60364	60380	60381	60381	My	49	“ How can you just throw me aside like this ? Is there someone else ? ”
60429	60440	60426	60426	She	1735	“ Who is it ? Are you cheating on me ? ”
60448	60485	60441	60441	I	49	“ I have never cheated on you . And I ca n’t currently be cheating on you because we ’re separated . And , if you ’d just sign the paperwork , we ’d be divorced . ”
60486	60495	60441	60441	I	49	“ So , you are seeing someone then ? ”
60496	60518	60519	60519	I	49	“ This conversation has no purpose . If you ’re here to annoy me , then congratulations . You ’ve succeeded . ”
60605	60620	60621	60621	She	1735	“ Is that what you think ? That I ’m here to annoy you ? ”
60632	60674	60675	60675	I	49	“ I think this entire thing is fucking insane , Landon . I ’m your fucking wife . There has to be a reason for this motherfucking madness . Either you ’ve found someone else or you ’ve gone clinically insane . ”
60678	60689	60675	60675	I	49	“ Really sweet . Now , I ’m clinically insane ? ”
60690	60693	60694	60694	she	1735	“ No , ”
60697	60706	60694	60694	she	1735	“ I think you ’re with someone else . ”
60707	60721	60722	60722	I	49	“ What is it going to take for you to sign the papers ? ”
60764	60767	60754	60754	I	49	“ Nothing . ”
60768	60798	60729	60729	She	1735	“ I do n’t believe you . You ’re already getting half of everything that ’s not covered in the prenup . What more could you want from me ? ”
60799	60802	60754	60754	I	49	“ Everything . ”
60803	60812	60754	60754	I	49	“ Well , you ca n’t have everything . ”
60813	60819	60754	60754	I	49	“ Then , just you . ”
60820	60877	60878	60878	Her	1086	“ No . You know what ? I ’m not having this conversation with you any longer . I ’ll have my lawyer contact you , and if we ca n’t settle this in a reasonable way , then we ’ll go to mediation , or we ’ll go to court . Your choice , Miranda . ”
60896	60910	60892	60892	I	49	“ Take me to dinner tonight . Have one more night with me . ”
60911	60914	60915	60915	I	49	“ No , ”
60936	60942	60943	60943	I	49	“ And I ’ll sign . ”
60985	60992	60973	60973	they	1088	“ I do n’t believe you . ”
60993	60998	61017	61017	man	49	“ I swear it . ”
61029	61032	61017	61017	man	49	“ Heyyyyy ! ”
61033	61038	61039	61039	Miranda	84	“ Oh , Morgan , ”
61064	61074	61043	61043	She	221	“ How good to see you . As always . ”
61075	61099	61100	61100	she	221	“ Same , Miranda . What are you doing here ? Just took a wrong turn and ended up in Lubbock , huh ? ”
61112	61130	61043	61043	She	221	“ I ’m here to see my husband . You do n’t have to be so patronizing . ”
61131	61140	61141	61141	Morgan	48	“ Oh , big words . So adorable , ”
61150	61153	61144	61144	I	49	“ Morgan . ”
61154	61167	61168	61168	Miranda	84	“ Are you going to let her talk to me like this ? ”
61175	61185	61186	61186	I	49	“ You think I have any control over her ? ”
61189	61194	61195	61195	Morgan	48	“ He does n’t , ”
61198	61208	61209	61209	Morgan	48	“ How did you even know she was here ? ”
61212	61217	61218	61218	She	48	“ Gossip travels quick . ”
61224	61235	61218	61218	She	48	“ Ready to go home now ? Buh - bye ! ”
61236	61244	61245	61245	Morgan	48	“ You ca n’t make me leave . ”
61260	61334	61245	61245	Morgan	48	“ Hmm … last I checked … I was the vice president of this company . That kind of makes me … in charge around here . I know that must be hard for you to comprehend since you do n’t have a job . Your idea of work is being a stay - at - home wife , which means spending all of my brother ’s money and generally being a bimbo . ”
61335	61341	61417	61417	she	48	“ Fuck you , Morgan . ”
61342	61356	61357	61357	I	49	“ So , as you can see , I can make you leave . ”
61385	61402	61403	61403	I	49	“ It ’s okay . She ’s going to go . Are n’t you , Miranda ? ”
61406	61411	61412	61412	she	48	“ What about dinner ? ”
61481	61488	61500	61500	She	48	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
61489	61496	61497	61497	Miranda	84	“ Do n’t think about anything , ”
61505	61510	61500	61500	She	48	“ Just text me . ”
61511	61520	61521	61521	Morgan	48	“ It ’s time for you to go ! ”
61524	61547	61548	61548	Miranda	84	“ You ’re trespassing on private property , and if you do n’t get out of here , I ’ll call security . ”
61555	61564	61548	61548	Miranda	84	“ You ’re such a bitch , Morgan . ”
61565	61570	61571	61571	Morgan	48	“ Fine by me ! ”
61575	61580	61581	61581	Miranda	84	“ Now , out ! ”
61651	61663	61664	61664	Morgan	48	“ You are not seriously considering going to dinner with her ? ”
61671	61689	61690	61690	I	49	“ What the hell did she say before I showed up that would make you consider that ? ”
61707	61719	61720	61720	She	51	“ Oh my God , you ’re not getting back together . ”
61728	61750	61720	61720	She	51	“ Please , for the love of all things holy , tell me you are not getting back together with her ! ”
61751	61762	61763	61763	I	49	“ We ’re not getting back together . Calm down , ”
61769	61815	61763	61763	I	49	“ Oh , thank God . I thought I was going to have to stage an intervention . I would get the entire family together . We ’d meet at Jensen ’s place . It would probably involve a PowerPoint presentation and lots of whiskey . ”
61832	61845	61828	61828	I	49	“ I get it . No one in the family likes her . ”
61846	61849	61720	61720	She	51	“ Understatement . ”
61850	61867	61828	61828	I	49	“ And you ’re all thrilled that my marriage is dissolving , and we ’re divorcing . ”
61868	61871	61828	61828	I	49	“ Very . ”
61872	61888	61720	61720	She	51	“ And you do n’t care how it happens as long as it ’s done . ”
61889	61934	61828	61828	I	49	“ Well , more or less . I mean , I want you to be happy . And I ’m certain you ’ll come out of this happier than you were before . I do n’t know how you lived with her this long . ”
61935	61948	61828	61828	I	49	“ You know , she was n’t always like that with me . ”
61949	61960	61961	61961	Morgan	48	“ Or you were just banging and did n’t care . ”
61969	61974	61975	61975	I	49	“ Horrible mental image . ”
61978	61996	61975	61975	I	49	“ You ’re a riot , Morgan . Now , really , what are you doing here ? ”
61997	62043	62066	62066	Morgan	48	“ Hello ? I saved your ass . I heard — and I quote—‘Landon ’s hot wife is here . ’ So , I ran as soon as I could to take care of it . You ’re a softy . Like this dinner thing … ”
62044	62065	62066	62066	Morgan	48	“ Look , she promised she ’d sign the divorce papers if I went to one more dinner with her . ”
62069	62075	62066	62066	Morgan	48	“ She ’ll sign anyway . ”
62076	62082	61975	61975	I	49	“ She has n’t yet . ”
62083	62102	61975	61975	I	49	“ We ’re not in dire straits here . She ’s going to sign . She has to . ”
62103	62113	62066	62066	Morgan	48	“ I ’d like her to do it today . ”
62114	62132	61975	61975	I	49	“ And do you think going to dinner with her will somehow miraculously make her do that ? ”
62133	62161	62162	62162	I	49	“ I do n’t know , but if it will , is n’t it worth pursuing ? I will do anything to make her do this faster , ”
62169	62186	62166	62166	Morgan	48	“ Do n’t say anything . You do n’t know what she ’ll come up with . ”
62187	62203	62066	62066	Morgan	48	“ I ’ll think about it . I do n’t know what I ’ll do . ”
62204	62221	62222	62222	I	49	“ Please do not do anything stupid . There ’s still time to stage that intervention . ”
62231	62260	62222	62222	I	49	“ You ’ve done enough for me , Morgan . The divorce will be finalized soon , and then we can all move on from this train wreck . ”
62261	62269	62270	62270	she	48	“ I wo n’t hold my breath , ”
62273	62280	62222	62222	I	49	“ Always a ray of sunshine . ”
62281	62307	62308	62308	I	49	“ I run a business . I do n’t need to be a fucking ray of sunshine . I just need to get shit done . ”
62316	62329	62308	62308	I	49	“ If only we were all as amazing as you , Morgan . ”
62330	62339	62340	62340	I	49	“ Do n’t do anything stupid , okay ? ”
62346	62351	62340	62340	I	49	“ Do I ever ? ”
62352	62370	62371	62371	She	48	“ All the time . You and Austin . You ’re going to give me gray hair . ”
62384	62414	62371	62371	She	48	“ If you ’re going to do something stupid , then do n’t blame me when it backfires in your face , okay ? I ’m warning you now . ”
62415	62419	62420	62420	I	49	“ Warning noted . ”
62720	62725	62731	62731	his	766	“ Hey , Landon ! ”
62766	62771	62772	62772	I	49	“ Hey , man , ”
62779	62785	62772	62772	I	49	“ What ’s going on ? ”
62786	62791	62792	62792	he	766	“ It ’s Matt , ”
62798	62810	62792	62792	he	766	“ Right . Matt . What can I do for you ? ”
62811	62823	62824	62824	Matt	49	“ I wanted to give you a high five , man , ”
62870	62874	62866	62866	him	1106	“ What for ? ”
62875	62883	62884	62884	Matt	49	“ You have a really hot wife ! ”
62916	62937	62938	62938	He	49	“ I mean , they do n’t make them like that around here , if you know what I mean . ”
62971	62996	62997	62997	Matt	49	“ You should remember who you ’re speaking with . I wo n’t condone people degrading women in such a manner in my office . ”
63000	63024	62997	62997	Matt	49	“ Uh , yeah , totally . Sorry . I did n’t mean anything by it . I thought it was a compliment . ”
63025	63032	63033	63033	Matt	49	“ That ’s what concerns me . ”
63042	63047	63033	63033	Matt	49	“ I , uh … ”
63048	63065	62997	62997	Matt	49	“ Do n’t worry about it . Just try to be more respectful in the future . ”
63085	63091	63078	63078	She	51	“ Can I help you ? ”
63092	63110	63078	63078	She	51	“ Yes . As a matter of fact , I need to see you in my office . ”
63111	63118	63119	63119	she	51	“ Did I do something wrong ? ”
63128	63157	63119	63119	she	51	“ On the contrary , I wanted to discuss Jim ’s old job . I ’ll be talking with everyone throughout the week , regarding the new position . ”
63158	63162	63163	63163	She	51	“ I see . ”
63184	63188	63189	63189	I	49	“ After you . ”
63242	63248	63249	63249	Heidi	51	“ That was … interesting , ”
63252	63257	63249	63249	Heidi	51	“ More like outrageous . ”
63258	63266	63238	63238	she	51	“ Which part ? Morgan or Miranda ? ”
63267	63270	63271	63271	I	49	“ Yes , ”
63297	63311	63280	63280	She	51	“ I ’m guessing I ’m not here to discuss the new job . ”
63312	63316	63317	63317	I	49	“ Not exactly , ”
63320	63340	63317	63317	I	49	“ I figured . So … Miranda is back . What does that mean ? Are you back together ? ”
63341	63350	63280	63280	She	51	“ Did you not hear the shouting match ? ”
63351	63369	63317	63317	I	49	“ I heard Morgan bossing Miranda around . I do n’t know where you stand on her . ”
63370	63391	63317	63317	I	49	“ Same place I ’ve stood with her since the reunion . I ’m leaving her . It ’s over . ”
63392	63400	63401	63401	Heidi	51	“ But she does n’t want that ? ”
63448	63470	63440	63440	I	49	“ Hey , this still does n’t change anything between us . That ’s why I wanted to talk to you . ”
63471	63484	63485	63485	She	51	“ So , you ’re not going to dinner with her then ? ”
63497	63512	63485	63485	She	51	“ I do n’t know . I wanted to talk to you about that . ”
63513	63521	63522	63522	She	51	“ What ’s there to talk about ? ”
63530	63537	63522	63522	She	51	“ You clearly want to go . ”
63538	63576	63485	63485	She	51	“ Hold up . I clearly do not want to go , but she said , if I went , she ’d sign the divorce papers . That seems like a good thing for me and you . ”
63577	63581	63582	63582	she	51	“ Just dinner ? ”
63586	63593	63485	63485	She	51	“ That ’s what she said . ”
63594	63597	63522	63522	She	51	“ Yep . ”
63598	63605	63485	63485	She	51	“ And do you believe her ? ”
63606	63612	63613	63613	I	49	“ I do n’t know , ”
63618	63630	63613	63613	I	49	“ What do you think ? Is it worth a shot ? ”
63631	63641	63642	63642	Heidi	51	“ Honestly , it sounds like a horrible idea , ”
63645	63656	63642	63642	Heidi	51	“ Then , I wo n’t go . Easy enough . ”
63657	63660	63661	63661	she	51	“ But , ”
63677	63698	63665	63665	She	51	“ I do want it to be over , Landon . I hate hiding . I hate all of this . ”
63706	63710	63699	63699	She	51	“ It sucks . ”
63743	63767	63768	63768	My	49	“ Me , too , Heidi . You know I hate this as well . I do n’t even want to hide you . ”
63786	63789	63790	63790	she	51	“ Landon , ”
63793	63799	63790	63790	she	51	“ We ’re at work ! ”
63800	63816	63775	63775	She	51	“ I know . I ’m sorry . I ca n’t help it around you . ”
63817	63845	63790	63790	she	51	“ You are my boss . I am your employee . There is a line we ’re not supposed to cross , and you keep hurdling it . ”
63846	63850	63851	63851	She	51	“ With pleasure . ”
63856	63892	63851	63851	She	51	“ I hate the idea of you spending any time with Miranda . She ’s unpredictable , which makes her a liability . However , if you think you can make headway , then go . ”
63893	63896	63851	63851	She	51	“ Heidi — ”
63897	63917	63918	63918	I	49	“ I ’ll be fine . I ’ll just … go hang out with Em . She ’ll understand . ”
63991	64009	64010	64010	Heidi	51	“ I ’m not going . Not if you ’re hurting half as much as Emery was . ”
64013	64029	64030	64030	she	51	“ No , I did n’t mean that with you . I meant , Vanessa , ”
64040	64070	64030	64030	she	51	“ Em goes to see Colton every month and has to deal with her . She can commiserate . Seriously … just go , but do n’t enjoy it . ”
64102	64123	64124	64124	She	51	“ I could never enjoy a single moment spent with her … when I could be spending it with you . ”
64134	64147	64148	64148	I	49	“ Good . Now , make the bitch sign the damn paperwork . ”
64151	64154	64155	64155	I	49	“ Deal . ”
64185	64190	64191	64191	Austin	41	“ Hey , bro , ”
64197	64202	64203	64203	Patrick	632	“ Hey , hey , ”
64219	64228	64216	64217	Jesus Christ	51	“ Have you been drinking on the job ? ”
64237	64240	64233	64233	He	51	“ Maybe ? ”
64241	64252	64233	64233	He	51	“ One day , they are going to fire you . ”
64253	64256	64233	64233	He	51	“ Doubtful . ”
64257	64265	64266	64266	Patrick	632	“ And not why we ’re here , ”
64272	64284	64266	64266	Patrick	632	“ We heard that wifey showed up at the office today . ”
64285	64295	64233	64233	He	51	“ God , have you been talking to Morgan ? ”
64299	64311	64312	64312	Austin	41	“ She said that you were going to dinner with Miranda , ”
64322	64336	64315	64315	He	51	“ Yeah . I ’m going to get her to sign the paperwork . ”
64337	64343	64344	64344	Austin	41	“ Not a good idea , ”
64347	64358	64359	64359	I	49	“ What would you know about good decisions regarding relationships ? ”
64365	64379	64359	64359	I	49	“ Either of you actually . Have you ever had a serious girlfriend ? ”
64380	64389	64390	64390	Patrick	632	“ Oh , there was that one time , ”
64393	64400	64401	64401	Austin	41	“ No , there was n’t , ”
64404	64423	64401	64401	Austin	41	“ I mean … you were serious with that HR chick for , like , a hot minute . ”
64424	64427	64428	64428	I	49	“ Julia ? ”
64431	64440	64401	64401	Austin	41	“ I did n’t know y’ all dated . ”
64441	64446	64447	64447	Austin	41	“ We did n’t , ”
64452	64474	64447	64447	Austin	41	“ This is n’t about us . This is about Miranda . I mean , I know you ’re banging Heidi … ”
64475	64483	64484	64484	I	49	“ Could you keep your voice down ? ”
64507	64537	64505	64505	Jesus	51	“ And Miranda has a way of fucking you over , dude . I mean , you had to marry her before you realized she was a massive bitch . ”
64578	64596	64597	64597	I	49	“ Appreciate the concern , guys , but she ’s signing the paperwork . That ’s it , ”
64601	64614	64615	64615	Patrick	632	“ Should I take care of your girl while you ’re away ? ”
64667	64674	64675	64675	Patrick	632	“ Dude , I was joking ! ”
64678	64691	64692	64692	I	49	“ Do not ever make a joke like that about Heidi again , ”
64695	64698	64692	64692	I	49	“ Ever . ”
64699	64708	64709	64709	Patrick	632	“ You know I ’m just fucking around , ”
64712	64717	64718	64718	Austin	41	“ Landon , bro , ”
64728	64731	64732	64732	I	49	“ Ever , ”
64735	64739	64740	64740	Patrick	632	“ Got it , ”
64743	64753	64740	64740	Patrick	632	“ Clear as day . No jokes about Heidi . ”
64770	64835	64740	64740	Patrick	632	“ I ’m going to this fucking dinner with my soon - to - be ex - wife , and it ’s the last goddamn thing that I want to do . I want this marriage to be over . I want to move on with my life . So , while I appreciate y’ all trying to steer me in the right direction , ”
64850	64856	64836	64836	I	49	“ back the fuck off . ”
64875	64892	64871	64871	Austin	41	“ Text if you need an out . We ’ll be happy to make a scene . ”
64893	64896	64897	64897	I	49	“ Thanks , ”
65139	65145	65146	65146	she	51	“ Sorry I ’m late , ”
65210	65217	65218	65218	I	49	“ I was about to leave , ”
65233	65240	65226	65226	She	51	“ No , you were n’t . ”
65282	65288	65289	65289	she	51	“ You wore the suit , ”
65318	65332	65310	65310	I	49	“ Did you bring the paperwork ? Are you going to sign now ? ”
65333	65360	65361	65361	She	51	“ Did n’t you get a good look at me ? Where would I hide divorce papers ? Feel free to try to find them though . ”
65366	65371	65361	65361	She	51	“ I ’ll pass . ”
65372	65375	65376	65376	Miranda	84	“ Shame . ”
65388	65400	65376	65376	Miranda	84	“ I ’ll sign when I get home . No rush . ”
65401	65410	65411	65411	I	49	“ So , none of this is necessary ? ”
65421	65444	65411	65411	I	49	“ Sit down , Landon . Have some wine with me . Relax . I ’ll sign your precious papers . Just … ”
65453	65466	65445	65445	Her	51	“ Just … let it be like old times for one night . ”
65550	65553	65554	65554	Miranda	84	“ So , ”
65581	65584	65564	65564	She	51	“ So ? ”
65585	65594	65595	65595	My	49	“ I ’m ready to get pregnant now . ”
65621	65625	65609	65609	she	51	“ You what ? ”
65626	65638	65639	65639	I	49	“ Pregnant , silly . I think we should try again . ”
65647	65652	65639	65639	I	49	“ Um … no . ”
65653	65684	65609	65609	she	51	“ Well , that ’s why you ’re divorcing me , right ? Because I lost the first one and then jokingly said that I did n’t want any kids . ”
65685	65690	65609	65609	she	51	“ That ’s not — ”
65691	65700	65701	65701	she	51	“ God , I get it , Landon , ”
65704	65754	65609	65609	she	51	“ I mean , I understand where you ’re coming from . You want a big family . You come from a big family . I did n’t think it was that serious . I did n’t think you ’d want to walk away just because I was scared . ”
65755	65764	65765	65765	Her	51	“ That is not what I ’m doing . ”
65770	65828	65765	65765	Her	51	“ Then , let ’s figure this out . I know I ’ve been moody the last year . I know I have n’t been my best me with you , but that does n’t mean we give up . We can try harder . We can try for another baby . Just … don’t leave me . ”
65829	65840	65609	65609	she	51	“ Miranda , you can not do this right now . ”
65841	65845	65846	65846	she	51	“ Do what ? ”
65849	65856	65609	65609	she	51	“ Try to save our marriage ? ”
65857	65879	65880	65880	I	49	“ Our marriage is in the process of being dissolved . I ’m here so that you ’ll make it official , ”
65889	65902	65880	65880	I	49	“ The last thing I want is have a baby with you . ”
65903	65929	65609	65609	she	51	“ That is n’t what you said a couple months ago ! You were yelling at me because of some throw away statement I made . ”
65930	65934	65935	65935	I	49	“ Throw away … ”
65946	65968	65935	65935	I	49	“ It ’s more than one statement . This is bigger than that . But I am not changing my mind . ”
65969	65974	65880	65880	I	49	“ Is it Emery ? ”
65975	65999	65609	65609	she	51	“ How many times do I have to tell you that Emery is with Jensen , and I have no feelings for her ? ”
66000	66017	65935	65935	I	49	“ Another time I guess because I do n’t believe it . It ’s something else . ”
66018	66048	66049	66049	Miranda	84	“ I ca n’t believe I even have to say this because you already know why I ’m divorcing you . But do I need to tell you again ? ”
66070	66087	66066	66066	she	84	“ Fine . Tell me again . Because I think you ’re making a huge mistake . ”
66088	66100	66101	66101	I	49	“ I ’m divorcing you because what we have is broken , ”
66114	66131	66101	66101	I	49	“ We are two different people , and it has taken me years to realize that . ”
66132	66227	66228	66228	I	49	“ This is insane , Landon . I ’ve given you everything . I moved to Tampa for you where I knew absolutely no one . I quit my job for you so that I could support you while you golfed . I gave up holidays with my family in Augusta to be here in this desert wasteland with your family who hates me . I ’ve dealt with golf fans and cling - ons and all of that bullshit . You think I ruined your life , Landon ? Look a little closer . ”
66361	66367	66368	66368	I	49	“ The answer is no , ”
66376	66381	66382	66382	she	1129	“ No to what ? ”
66392	66409	66382	66382	she	1129	“ Everything . We ’re here for you to sign the paperwork . That ’s it . ”
66410	66419	66382	66382	she	1129	“ You ’re not even going to consider ? ”
66420	66433	66382	66382	she	1129	“ I do n’t have to . This is over , Miranda . ”
66434	66442	66443	66443	she	1129	“ Then , I change my terms , ”
66457	66473	66382	66382	she	1129	“ You ca n’t change the terms . You said dinner . That ’s it . ”
66474	66496	66497	66497	I	49	“ Well , if you really think that we ’re never getting back together , then this wo n’t even matter . ”
66514	66517	66505	66505	I	49	“ No . ”
66518	66538	66497	66497	I	49	“ One more thing , and then I ’m out of your life forever … just like you want . ”
66539	66545	66546	66546	She	1129	“ What ? What thing ? ”
66558	66567	66546	66546	She	1129	“ Make love to me one more time . ”
66689	66699	66700	66700	She	1129	“ For the good time I ’ll be missing . ”
66705	66708	66700	66700	She	1129	“ Landon ! ”
66709	66715	66716	66716	I	49	“ The answer is no , ”
66722	66744	66716	66716	I	49	“ Actually , the answer is fuck no . I ’d rather see you in court than sit here another minute . ”
66745	66750	66752	66752	I	49	“ Landon , wait ! ”
67414	67419	67420	67424	the guy she was playing	49	“ Hey , man , ”
67429	67434	67420	67424	the guy she was playing	49	“ What ’s up ? ”
67447	67450	67439	67439	Heidi	51	“ Landon ! ”
67451	67456	67422	67422	she	51	“ Time to go . ”
67457	67480	67481	67481	I	49	“ No way ! I have , like … a whole beer here , and I ’m totally slaying Tommy over here . ”
67496	67501	67488	67488	She	51	“ You were busy . ”
67502	67509	67510	67510	I	49	“ I ’m not busy anymore , ”
67519	67527	67510	67510	I	49	“ I ’ll just finish this game . ”
67528	67531	67488	67488	She	51	“ No . ”
67532	67549	67550	67550	Tommy	130	“ Hey , pal , why do n’t you let the lady do what she wants ? ”
67553	67569	67570	67570	I	49	“ Why do n’t you find another half - naked drunk girl to hit on ? ”
67576	67590	67570	67570	I	49	“ I ’m going to be here , taking care of this one . ”
67603	67614	67591	67591	Heidi	51	“ I do n’t need to be taken care of . ”
67622	67689	67591	67591	Heidi	51	“ You ’re right . You do n’t need to be taken care of , but I am going to take care of you anyway . You ca n’t convince me otherwise . And , right now , I would like to put some clothes on you and get you away from every guy in this place who wants to whip his dick out right now . ”
67690	67701	67702	67702	she	51	“ Oh , you want to put clothes on me ? ”
67709	67714	67702	67702	she	51	“ That ’s new . ”
67732	67737	67729	67729	She	51	“ I ’m fine ! ”
67738	67745	67729	67729	She	51	“ We should get you home . ”
67746	67751	67729	67729	She	51	“ Ugh , why ? ”
67752	67784	67785	67785	Her	51	“ You have work in the morning . You ’re drunk . You need to talk to me , and this is n’t helping as much as you want to believe . ”
67811	67817	67818	67818	she	51	“ I ’m staying here , ”
67822	67840	67818	67818	she	51	“ Do n’t make me throw you over my shoulder and carry you out of this bar . ”
67841	67846	67847	67847	she	51	“ You would n’t , ”
67850	67854	67855	67855	I	49	“ Your back . ”
67860	67864	67865	67865	She	51	“ Watch me . ”
67914	67917	67918	67918	she	51	“ Fine , ”
67942	67945	67946	67946	I	49	“ Heidi , ”
67954	67961	67962	67962	She	51	“ Hey , are you okay ? ”
67968	67984	67985	67985	I	49	“ You know , I made out with that guy Tommy on New Year ’s . ”
67990	67999	67985	67985	I	49	“ No , I did n’t know that . ”
68000	68065	67985	67985	I	49	“ Yeah . He ’s , like , a totally normal guy . We hit it off real fine . And when you left me there all alone , I went and found someone else . I made out with him because you were n’t there . You were married . You could n’t be with me . And I wanted to forget you . ”
68066	68105	68106	68106	I	49	“ You ca n’t forget me , Heidi . No matter how far you try to push me away or come up with reasons that we ca n’t be together , we will always end up right here . ”
68114	68141	68145	68145	Heidi	51	“ Because I am yours , and you are mine . And we are not just a finite point on a line ; we are limitless . ”
68146	68151	68152	68152	I	49	“ Jesus , Landon , ”
68304	68313	68314	68314	I	49	“ I ’m so glad you ’re here , ”
68317	68328	68329	68329	I	49	“ Me , too , firecracker . Me , too . ”
68336	68344	68345	68345	he	1163	“ Can we get you home now ? ”
68353	68359	68345	68345	he	1163	“ What about my car ? ”
68360	68369	68370	68370	I	49	“ We ’ll get it in the morning . ”
68376	68381	68382	68382	We	1166	“ Yeah . Okay . ”
68561	68565	68566	68566	Landon	533	“ Which way ? ”
68607	68613	68614	68614	I	49	“ Uh … that room . ”
68698	68701	68702	68702	I	49	“ Fuck , ”
68720	68728	68715	68715	My	49	“ How much did I drink tonight ? ”
68729	68753	68702	68702	I	49	“ I ’m going to go with a lot . You were this drunk that night we played pool with Em last Christmas . ”
68754	68758	68759	68759	I	49	“ No way , ”
68762	68772	68759	68759	I	49	“ Em was way drunker than me that night . ”
68773	68783	68702	68702	I	49	“ Yes . But you were wasted , too . ”
68784	68794	68759	68759	I	49	“ And you would n’t even help me inside . ”
68795	68800	68801	68801	he	49	“ Yes , well , ”
68809	68812	68801	68801	he	49	“ What ? ”
68854	68864	68865	68865	he	49	“ I did n’t trust myself to come inside , ”
68868	68874	68875	68875	I	49	“ Oh ? Why not ? ”
68881	68905	68875	68875	I	49	“ Because I wanted more than I was allowed to have that night , and you would have given me what I wanted . ”
68906	68911	68912	68912	I	49	“ I would have , ”
69085	69093	69094	69094	I	49	“ But you can have it tonight , ”
69101	69111	69098	69098	He	49	“ I think you ’re a bit drunk tonight . ”
69112	69124	69098	69098	He	49	“ So ? You would n’t be taking advantage of me . ”
69125	69134	69135	69135	I	49	“ Oh , I most certainly would be . ”
69189	69204	69181	69181	My	49	“ You do n’t look like you want to be in this suit anymore . ”
69205	69215	69224	69224	I	49	“ I ’d be happy to burn the suit . ”
69216	69223	69224	69224	I	49	“ Did she touch your suit ? ”
69233	69245	69224	69224	I	49	“ She looked at it . That was enough for me . ”
69246	69255	69256	69256	I	49	“ Me , too . Definitely burning it . ”
69280	69291	69292	69292	He	49	“ We ’ll probably have to take it off first . ”
69296	69307	69308	69308	I	49	“ You ’re going to be the death of me . ”
69443	69448	69449	69449	he	49	“ Fuck , Heidi , ”
69508	69520	69496	69496	His	49	“ Every guy in the fucking bar wanted in these shorts . ”
69540	69562	69521	69521	He	49	“ It killed me that I was n’t with you , that I could n’t claim you right then and there . ”
69623	69641	69612	69612	He	77	“ Oh , yeah ? Is that why you were willing to throw me over your shoulder ? ”
69642	69670	69612	69612	He	77	“ I was willing to do a lot more than that . I would have been perfectly happy with bending this hot ass over the pool table . ”
69671	69683	69684	69684	I	49	“ And here I thought , I was the jealous one , ”
69702	69722	69688	69688	He	77	“ You do not have a single thing to be jealous about . You are my one and only . ”
69895	69904	69888	69888	he	77	“ You do n’t want me to finish ? ”
69912	69925	69926	69926	He	77	“ God , yes , but I want inside your pussy more . ”
69994	69999	70000	70000	I	49	“ Landon , please , ”
70003	70008	70009	70009	he	77	“ You ’re sure ? ”
70031	70039	70040	70040	He	77	“ God , please , fuck me . ”
70154	70161	70162	70162	he	77	“ Oh , fuck , Heidi , ”
70173	70180	70162	70162	he	77	“ You feel so fucking good . ”
70181	70187	70188	70188	I	49	“ Oh God , yes , ”
70248	70256	70257	70257	I	49	“ I think I need a shower . ”
70261	70268	70257	70257	I	49	“ Yes . We both do . ”
70269	70282	70283	70283	Landon	77	“ Come on , firecracker . Let ’s get you cleaned up . ”
70428	70449	70416	70416	Landon	77	“ You look tired . Why do n’t you crawl into bed , and I ’ll find you some clothes ? ”
70508	70517	70518	70518	I	49	“ T - shirts are in the closet , ”
70521	70531	70518	70518	I	49	“ You hang up all your T - shirts ? ”
70532	70541	70542	70542	He	77	“ Yes . I ’m a bit obsessive . ”
70578	70582	70583	70583	I	49	“ No shorts ? ”
70599	70629	70630	70630	I	49	“ I ’d love to keep you naked all night , but I think you need to sleep . And I want to be able to grab your ass . ”
70641	70646	70633	70633	I	49	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
70647	70650	70651	70651	he	77	“ Probably , ”
70657	70668	70669	70669	I	49	“ Hey , what are all those letters in there ? ”
70686	70689	70690	70690	I	49	“ What ? ”
70693	70712	70713	70713	he	77	“ You realize you have a huge collection of letters in a box in your closet , right ? ”
70731	70738	70739	70739	I	49	“ You went through my letters ? ”
70744	70747	70748	70748	He	77	“ No . ”
70765	70779	70760	70760	I	49	“ I just saw them . They ’re sitting out in the open . ”
70780	70789	70790	70790	I	49	“ They ’re nothing . Forget about them , ”
70797	70800	70790	70790	I	49	“ Heidi — ”
70801	70809	70810	70810	I	49	“ I said , forget about them . ”
70879	70888	70869	70869	Landon	77	“ Heidi , come out here , please . ”
70899	70902	70889	70889	I	49	“ Hey . ”
70903	70922	70923	70923	I	49	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t realize that would upset you . I was legitimately curious . ”
70934	70949	70923	70923	I	49	“ It’s … it ’s okay . I just … I was n’t prepared . ”
70950	70964	70965	70965	I	49	“ It ’s okay . Let ’s go to bed , all right ? ”
71039	71046	71047	71047	I	49	“ They ’re from my dad , ”
71077	71084	71085	71085	Landon	533	“ I thought they might be , ”
71091	71098	71085	71085	Landon	533	“ I do n’t answer them . ”
71099	71102	71085	71085	Landon	533	“ Ever ? ”
71103	71110	71111	71111	Landon	533	“ Not once in six years . ”
71115	71124	71125	71125	I	49	“ Is that when he went to prison ? ”
71136	71142	71128	71128	My	49	“ Six years on Saturday . ”
71143	71155	71128	71128	My	49	“ That ’s a long time not to talk to him . ”
71156	71161	71162	71162	I	49	“ Not long enough , ”
71233	71246	71216	71217	Hank Martin	118	“ And , on Saturday … are you going to be okay ? ”
71247	71255	71256	71256	I	49	“ I usually spend the day alone , ”
71259	71271	71272	71272	he	533	“ I do n’t want you to be alone this year , ”
71276	71288	71289	71289	I	49	“ Not anymore . Not when you have me . Okay ? ”
71297	71300	71304	71304	Heidi	77	“ Okay . ”
71322	71325	71317	71317	Emery	533	“ Heidi ? ”
71326	71331	71332	71332	I	49	“ Oh , fuck , ”
71385	71388	71389	71389	I	49	“ Landon , ”
71395	71416	71389	71389	I	49	“ Get up . Get up . Get up . You need to … like , hide in the closet . ”
71439	71442	71428	71428	He	77	“ Morning . ”
71443	71449	71428	71428	He	77	“ Landon , come on . ”
71450	71460	71461	71461	he	77	“ Did you say , hide in the closet ? ”
71473	71479	71461	71461	he	77	“ Yeah , Emery is — ”
71511	71516	71517	71517	Emery	533	“ Oh , shit , ”
71520	71523	71524	71524	I	49	“ Home , ”
71539	71544	71527	71527	Landon	533	“ Morning , Em . ”
71545	71550	71551	71551	she	1201	“ Oh my God , ”
71562	71584	71585	71585	She	1201	“ That was not … I mean — fuck . I ’m just going to — yep , all right then . ”
71596	71599	71593	71593	I	49	“ Ugh ! ”
71607	71614	71600	71600	Landon	533	“ Why are you so embarrassed ? ”
71623	71630	71615	71615	I	49	“ You are such a dude . ”
71631	71636	71637	71637	he	533	“ Hey , hey , ”
71645	71654	71637	71637	he	533	“ She ’s the one dating my brother . ”
71668	71681	71682	71682	He	533	“ And do you want to see her in bed with him ? ”
71688	71697	71682	71682	He	533	“ Yeah , I did n’t think so . ”
71721	71726	71710	71710	I	49	“ Hey , Em ? ”
71727	71731	71732	71732	Emery	533	“ In here , ”
71738	71741	71742	71742	She	297	“ Hey . ”
71759	71764	71747	71747	she	297	“ Sorry about that . ”
71765	71771	71772	71772	she	297	“ It ’s no big , ”
71775	71787	71772	71772	she	297	“ I just … was a hundred percent unprepared for that . ”
71788	71799	71800	71800	Emery	533	“ Yeah , I guess it ’s probably pretty weird . ”
71809	71817	71800	71800	Emery	533	“ That ’s a word for it . ”
71818	71857	71858	71858	Emery	533	“ I know you said that you were cool with it , but I really do n’t want you to feel uncomfortable in your own apartment . We do n’t have to be here if you do n’t — ”
71864	71895	71858	71858	Emery	533	“ Bring it down a level , hooker . I do n’t care that you ’re together , and I do n’t want you to have to go somewhere else . ”
71896	71899	71900	71900	I	49	“ But ? ”
71903	71919	71920	71920	Landon	533	“ But … I do n’t know how long I can keep this from Jensen . ”
71942	71950	71930	71930	he	533	“ Sorry , just happened to overhear . ”
71958	71967	71951	71951	Emery	533	“ Yeah , because we ’re so quiet . ”
71968	71983	71984	71984	Emery	533	“ Telling Jensen would be a really bad idea for Heidi at this point . ”
71996	72050	71984	71984	Emery	533	“ I ’m going crazy over here . Secrets are a big thing between me and Jensen , and if he thinks I ’m holding something back , then he ’s going to get pissed . And , trust me , no one likes when that happens . Least of all , me . ”
72051	72066	72067	72067	I	49	“ Yeah , but if we tell Jensen , I could lose my job , ”
72070	72078	72079	72079	Emery	533	“ Or we could figure something out ! ”
72082	72100	72101	72101	Landon	533	“ I love my brother , but we all know he solves problems with a blunt instrument , ”
72104	72112	72113	72113	Emery	533	“ What if we talked to Morgan ? ”
72116	72120	72113	72113	Emery	533	“ Already did . ”
72121	72124	72125	72125	Emery	533	“ Fuck , ”
72128	72154	72125	72125	Emery	533	“ Okay , okay . I can figure this out , but if he shows up and y’ all are together , I never knew ! ”
72155	72159	72160	72160	Landon	533	“ Got it , ”
72166	72171	72163	72163	I	49	“ Thanks , Em . ”
72172	72177	72178	72178	Emery	533	“ You owe me , ”
72182	72196	72197	72197	Landon	533	“ And you … you should be lucky it ’s my best friend . ”
72203	72220	72221	72221	She	1205	“ We both appreciate it , Emery . Even if we do n’t both deserve it . ”
72233	72242	72243	72243	Emery	533	“ I have to get ready for work , ”
72249	72275	72243	72243	Emery	533	“ Will you please be careful ? I could have easily had Jensen with me , and we ’d be having a much different conversation . ”
72276	72289	72296	72296	she	1205	“ I ’d like to avoid that conversation if at all possible . ”
72290	72295	72296	72296	she	1205	“ Me , too , ”
72307	72325	72299	72299	Emery	533	“ This is so weird . You ’re sleeping with Landon Wright . Like … Landon Wright . ”
72326	72329	72330	72330	I	49	“ Yeah , ”
72339	72343	72330	72330	I	49	“ Guess so . ”
72344	72357	72358	72358	I	49	“ And it ’s the week of … and you seem okay . ”
72362	72377	72358	72358	I	49	“ I ’m holding up . I told him last night … about everything . ”
72378	72397	72398	72398	I	49	“ Holy shit , Heidi . That ’s huge . Y’all are really serious , are n’t you ? ”
72408	72442	72443	72443	Emery	533	“ I feel like it all happened so fast , yet … I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long . Just finding a guy who really gets me , you know ? ”
72449	72476	72443	72443	Emery	533	“ That , I do . And I ’m also queen of realizing that it ’s not always the guy you expected you ’d fall for . ”
72477	72486	72487	72487	I	49	“ What is it with these Wright brothers ? ”
72490	72496	72487	72487	I	49	“ If only I knew . ”
72497	72500	72443	72443	Emery	533	“ Seriously . ”
72501	72510	72511	72511	Emery	533	“ Falling for them only pads their egos , ”
72519	72527	72514	72514	I	49	“ As if their egos need padding . ”
72528	72534	72487	72487	I	49	“ Yet we love them . ”
72535	72539	72540	72540	I	49	“ We do , ”
72547	72568	72569	72569	I	49	“ Okay , seriously , work . Go put some clothes on , you slob . You ’re super naked . ”
72589	72598	72576	72576	I	49	“ Whatever . You like it , ho . ”
72599	72611	72612	72612	I	49	“ Oh , yeah , baby . Take it all off . ”
72629	72637	72638	72638	Emery	533	“ Come and get it , lover . ”
72755	72759	72740	72740	I	49	“ She okay ? ”
72770	72777	72740	72740	I	49	“ I think she ’s adjusting . ”
72778	72786	72740	72740	I	49	“ Yeah , welcome to the club . ”
72787	72830	72831	72831	He	533	“ You know what ? Do n’t use that tone with me about Emery . You were the one who ditched her on graduation day and left her in tattered pieces that I had to put back together for years , Landon . ”
72839	72880	72831	72831	He	533	“ Whoa . Okay . I did n’t mean to upset you like that . I meant that I had to adjust to her and Jensen . At least you told her about us before she walked in on us . ”
72881	72885	72886	72886	I	49	“ I know , ”
72895	72910	72911	72911	He	533	“ I get defensive about Emery . You really hurt her , you know . ”
72919	73064	72911	72911	He	533	“ Yeah . Trust me , I carry around the guilt from it . I was mad about what had happened with my dad , that the last thing I ’d ever said to him was that I chose Emery over him and that I would every time . When he died , I blamed myself , and I stupidly blamed Emery . I could n’t even look at her or think about her or talk to her without that pain . So , yeah , I get that you want to protect her . I was a dick to push her away when I was grieving , but it was high school . I have apologized for how I acted . And what happened with me and Emery has absolutely nothing to do with what ’s happening with me and you , Heidi . ”
73065	73075	73076	73076	I	49	“ That was what you said to your dad ? ”
73080	73085	73086	73086	he	49	“ Uh … yeah , ”
73092	73100	73086	73086	he	49	“ Did I never tell you that ? ”
73101	73116	72911	72911	He	533	“ I … no . I knew you got into an argument about college . ”
73117	73158	73159	73159	I	49	“ Yeah , well , what I would n’t give to redo those days . But then I do n’t know if I ’d be standing right here , and I know this is where I ’m supposed to be . ”
73188	73196	73197	73197	I	49	“ We should probably get my car , ”
73206	73212	73213	73213	he	49	“ And get to work , ”
73216	73223	73213	73213	he	49	“ But there ’s a bed . ”
73238	73245	73232	73232	he	49	“ And this ass . Fuck . ”
73402	73407	73395	73395	I	49	“ There you are ! ”
73417	73427	73408	73408	Julia	84	“ Yeah , sorry about that . Car trouble . ”
73428	73440	73441	73441	Matt	49	“ Landon must have had the same kind of car trouble , ”
73447	73450	73451	73451	I	49	“ What ? ”
73476	73483	73484	73484	Julia	84	“ Landon is n’t in yet , ”
73488	73500	73501	73501	I	49	“ Really ? Weird . Did he really have car trouble ? ”
73518	73530	73531	73531	I	49	“ We do n’t know . He ’s just not here . ”
73534	73544	73531	73531	I	49	“ Does n’t he have physical therapy or something ? ”
73545	73549	73550	73550	Matt	49	“ For what ? ”
73553	73557	73550	73550	Matt	49	“ Golf injury . ”
73558	73569	73531	73531	I	49	“ How do you know so much about Landon anyway ? ”
73570	73586	73531	73531	I	49	“ Well … we’ve been friends since high school . He dated my best friend . ”
73587	73590	73591	73591	Matt	49	“ Huh , ”
73634	73641	73642	73642	Matt	49	“ I did n’t realize that , ”
73646	73649	73650	73650	Julia	84	“ Anyway , ”
73653	73671	73650	73650	Julia	84	“ we ’re not here to talk about Landon . I ’m here to schedule your interview . ”
73672	73681	73682	73682	I	49	“ My interview for the lead engineer spot ? ”
73693	73700	73682	73682	I	49	“ Yes . That ’s right . ”
73701	73706	73707	73707	Matt	49	“ Congrats , Heidi , ”
73710	73716	73717	73717	I	49	“ I scheduled mine yesterday . ”
73733	73745	73731	73731	dude	49	“ Oh my God , yes . Let ’s do this . ”
73767	73784	73758	73758	She	84	“ Please tell me that you and Landon are not both late because you were together . ”
73785	73796	73797	73797	I	49	“ We ’re not both late because we were together , ”
73801	73808	73797	73797	I	49	“ It looks bad , Heidi . ”
73809	73813	73758	73758	She	84	“ I know , ”
73817	73880	73881	73881	I	49	“ That creep Matt is picking up on things , and I do n’t want him to put the pieces together about you two . I thought you were going to be smart about this . Showing up late , missing work at the same time , hanging out in his office , going to lunch together ? Heidi , come on . ”
73918	73927	73928	73928	I	49	“ I got it . I got it , ”
73944	73969	73931	73931	Julia	84	“ You are a serious contender for this promotion , Heidi . I should n’t even freaking tell you this , but you are . ”
74002	74009	73997	73997	I	49	“ I got it , Julia . ”
74010	74033	73997	73997	I	49	“ Good . Now that that ’s over , let ’s pen you in for Thursday morning at nine o’clock with Dennis . ”
74034	74038	73997	73997	I	49	“ Sounds good . ”
74039	74062	74063	74063	I	49	“ Now , what are you doing on Saturday ? Because I could desperately use some shopping for the Wright Charity Benefit . ”
74122	74134	74135	74135	She	84	“ Uh … Saturday is n’t good . How about Sunday ? ”
74140	74154	74135	74135	She	84	“ Trevor is dragging me to church with him and his entire family . ”
74155	74164	74135	74135	She	84	“ Oh , you ’re meeting the family ? ”
74165	74184	74101	74101	She	84	“ Yeah . Should be interesting . Unfortunately , they go to the same church as the Wrights . ”
74185	74194	74195	74195	I	49	“ That means … Austin will be there ? ”
74198	74203	74204	74204	I	49	“ Yeah . Dick . ”
74207	74227	74204	74204	I	49	“ Okay . Not Sunday . We ’ll figure it out . Still plenty of time before the Benefit . ”
74228	74252	74253	74253	I	49	“ True . Just let me know if you change your mind about Saturday . I could use some time with my girls ! ”
74337	74341	74332	74332	He	77	“ Good morning . ”
74342	74350	74332	74332	He	77	“ You ’re late , Mr. Wright . ”
74351	74357	74332	74332	He	77	“ Had a busy morning . ”
74358	74374	74375	74375	I	49	“ Me , too . Found out I have an interview for Jim ’s job , ”
74384	74387	74388	74388	he	77	“ Congratulations , ”
74395	74405	74388	74388	he	77	“ And that Matt suspects something is going on , ”
74417	74424	74411	74411	Landon	77	“ Huh . Is that right ? ”
74425	74434	74388	74388	he	77	“ Yep . We should be more careful . ”
74435	74448	74449	74449	He	77	“ Duly noted , Miss Martin . Good luck on your interview . ”
74528	74536	74537	74537	Matt	49	“ So , why was he late ? ”
74545	74558	74559	74559	I	49	“ Do n’t know . He said he had a busy morning , ”
74565	74577	74578	74578	he	49	“ Could you imagine if I used that as my excuse ? ”
74581	74589	74578	74578	he	49	“ Well , he ’s the boss . ”
74603	74607	74608	74608	he	49	“ Fucking Wrights , ”
74614	74622	74623	74623	He	49	“ They could get away with murder . ”
74920	74923	74911	74911	She	1240	“ Thanks , ”
74932	74938	74924	74924	I	49	“ How are you doing ? ”
74965	74972	74973	74973	Emery	533	“ Ready to face the day . ”
74982	75008	75009	75009	I	49	“ You ’re an incredible person , you have a brilliant mind , and you are my best friend . You know that , right ? ”
75012	75015	75009	75009	I	49	“ Thanks . ”
75016	75020	75021	75021	I	49	“ Come here . ”
75037	75044	75009	75009	I	49	“ I love you , Heidi . ”
75045	75053	75009	75009	I	49	“ Love you , too , Em . ”
75054	75062	75063	75063	I	49	“ Call me if you need me . ”
75205	75210	75193	75193	He	533	“ Morning , gorgeous . ”
75211	75214	75215	75215	I	49	“ Hey , ”
75222	75226	75215	75215	I	49	“ You ready ? ”
75227	75234	75235	75235	I	49	“ As long as you are . ”
75634	75639	75640	75640	I	49	“ Hey , Mom , ”
75643	75676	75640	75640	I	49	“ I , uh … just wanted to stop by and introduce you to Landon . He ’s , uh … a , uh , Wright . You probably knew his dad . ”
75688	75703	75684	75684	he	2066	“ He ’s kind of my boyfriend , and I thought you should meet . ”
75704	75721	75722	75722	Landon	77	“ Nice to meet you , Mrs. Martin . You have a real great girl here , ”
75733	75745	75727	75727	he	2066	“ So , I ’m kind of your boyfriend , huh ? ”
75746	75751	75684	75684	he	2066	“ That ’s right . ”
75752	75770	75727	75727	he	2066	“ I ’m looking forward to the day we can get rid of that kind of part . ”
75771	75776	75777	75777	I	49	“ Me , too , ”
75780	75812	75727	75727	he	2066	“ You know , few years I ’ll be as old as my mom when she died . It ’s scary to think that I ’ll live longer than she did . ”
75813	75843	75684	75684	he	2066	“ I know how that feels . I was only seven when my mom died . I was older than her almost two years ago . It was disorienting . ”
75844	75856	75857	75857	He	49	“ Do you want to see her while we ’re here ? ”
75862	75886	75887	75887	I	49	“ How about we do it when I can introduce you to both of them as my girlfriend … not just kind of ? ”
75893	75899	75887	75887	I	49	“ I ’d like that . ”
75900	75910	75911	75911	he	49	“ What else do you do on this day ? ”
75914	75978	75979	75979	He	49	“ I usually do all the things that I would have done with my parents before my mom died . It ’s like I get to mourn them both on the same day . It ’s kind of like … I give myself permission to be a kid again . It ’s dumb . I know . I never tell anyone about it . ”
75987	76015	75979	75979	He	49	“ The way you grieve is never dumb . It is unique to every person . Allowing yourself the time to do it is what ’s important . ”
76176	76216	76217	76217	I	49	“ Dad used to put me on his shoulders when I was kid so that I could reach the high branches in the trees . It was my favorite part , getting to throw apples down to my mom , ”
76228	76311	76221	76221	He	77	“ Sometimes , I would swing back and forth between their arms . We came every year , you know . My mom adored fresh apples . Later , when we got home , she would make me a homemade apple pie . She ’d always remind me to blow on it to cool it down . As a kid , I always wanted to eat the ice cream , but now , I would kill for a slice of her pie . ”
76312	76322	76323	76323	he	77	“ Let ’s make one when we get back , ”
76331	76348	76326	76326	I	49	“ No , I do n’t have her recipe . It ’s different . I tried . ”
76349	76355	76356	76356	he	77	“ All right , love , ”
76365	76372	76373	76373	I	49	“ Ready for our next stop ? ”
76381	76386	76387	76387	I	49	“ There ’s more ? ”
76390	76393	76387	76387	I	49	“ Yeah . ”
76394	76399	76400	76400	We	1271	“ Lead the way . ”
76458	76463	76464	76464	I	49	“ For my dad , ”
76467	76476	76464	76464	I	49	“ You used to come here a lot ? ”
76477	76520	76464	76464	I	49	“ Over the summer , he would bring home extra super - large DQ Blizzards that would last me the whole summer . My mom hated it , but she ’d sneak some of his ice cream when he was n’t looking . ”
76521	76536	76464	76464	I	49	“ And , normally , you ’d come and eat one of these alone ? ”
76537	76562	76563	76563	I	49	“ Yeah , well , it was a reminder of happier times , you know ? Before the … drugs and … and everything . ”
76573	76578	76579	76579	he	77	“ I get it , ”
76586	76595	76579	76579	he	77	“ I like knowing this side of you . ”
76596	76604	76579	76579	he	77	“ Thanks for being here with me . ”
76605	76622	76623	76623	I	49	“ I would n’t have missed it . If you need me , I ’m here . ”
76685	76695	76696	76696	I	49	“ I hope you know how to roller skate , ”
76710	76720	76707	76707	He	77	“ Uh , I have n’t skated in years . ”
76721	76729	76696	76696	I	49	“ Just do n’t break your back . ”
76730	76736	76737	76737	We	1274	“ Too late for that . ”
76848	76857	76858	76858	Landon	77	“ I ’m really not good at skating , ”
76867	76881	76858	76858	Landon	77	“ Color me surprised . A Wright actually is n’t good at something . ”
76882	76892	76861	76861	he	77	“ We ’re bad at a lot of stuff . ”
76893	76908	76909	76909	He	77	“ Well , I ’ll hold your hand , pretty boy . Come here . ”
76975	76985	76986	76986	Landon	77	“ Where did you learn to skate like that ? ”
77002	77006	76991	76991	I	49	“ My dad . ”
77007	77014	77015	77015	he	77	“ Hank Martin roller - skated ? ”
77020	77053	77015	77015	he	77	“ He was amazing . Grew up in an age where roller - skating was cheap , and all the cool kids did it . Showing off was my dad ’s pastime . ”
77054	77063	77064	77064	he	77	“ Do n’t know anyone else like that , ”
77091	77101	77081	77081	I	49	“ I do have a flair for the dramatic . ”
77102	77109	77015	77015	he	77	“ I like that about you . ”
77110	77119	77120	77120	He	77	“ What do n’t you like , Wright ? ”
77128	77131	77120	77120	He	77	“ Nothing . ”
77132	77137	77081	77081	I	49	“ Give me time . ”
77138	77159	77160	77160	He	77	“ I ’ve known you for a long time , Heidi . Not going to change how I feel now . ”
77312	77319	77320	77320	he	77	“ Where are we going next ? ”
77332	77338	77320	77320	he	77	“ Flips ? For pool ? ”
77339	77342	77343	77343	I	49	“ No , ”
77349	77353	77343	77343	I	49	“ Hank ’s . ”
77362	77369	77354	77354	Landon	77	“ But Hank ’s was demolished . ”
77370	77374	77375	77375	I	49	“ I know . ”
77518	77523	77524	77524	I	49	“ I miss him , ”
77528	77535	77524	77524	I	49	“ I miss him so much . ”
77544	77548	77536	77536	Landon	77	“ I know . ”
77549	77683	77685	77685	he	1298	“ I miss the man he used to be . When he used to be a good father . When he did n’t do drugs , then sell drugs , then fucking bankroll the bar with his drug money to try to keep it afloat . I wished he had n’t been the kind of dad who brought strange women over all the time . Married women . The kind who I never really knew their names , and they switched too often for me to care . I wished I had n’t had to clean up his fucking messes all the time . Help him in his drunken stupor and cry myself to sleep when he was in a drunken rage so bad that only passing out would get him to stop . “
77759	77760	77748	77749	her mom	140	” “
77787	77788	77782	77782	he	1298	” “
77795	77802	77791	77791	I	49	” I swiped at my eyes . “
77806	77812	77791	77791	I	49	” I shook my head . “
77815	77816	77817	77817	Heidi	77	” “
77819	77820	77817	77817	Heidi	77	” “
77832	77863	77864	77864	He	1298	” I shouted , standing up and throwing my arms out . I let out the last ounce of depressing news . The part I ’d held back from everyone . “
77937	77938	77934	77934	his	1298	” “
77941	77945	77934	77934	his	1298	” Landon whispered . “
77970	78103	77967	77967	he	1298	” Twenty - Eight Landon Spending that day with Heidi , when she was at her most vulnerable , had changed everything . I had fallen for her . Completely , utterly , unequivocally . And I was a fucking asshole . I knew why she needed this job . I now knew without question why this was so important to her . Yet I was gambling with it . I was gambling with her . I could feel the delicate tightrope we were walking on , and I feared our feet would slip if I was n’t careful . I did n’t know how to be more careful . Sunday morning , Heidi was wrapped in my arms when I got a text from Jensen . You still coming to church ? “
78106	78110	77967	77967	he	1298	” I spat . “
78113	78127	78128	78128	I	49	” Heidi asked , peering up at me with sleep - deprived eyes . “
78149	78150	78151	78151	Wo	144	” “
78157	78168	78151	78151	Wo	144	” she mumbled . I gritted my teeth and nodded . “
78198	78199	78151	78151	Wo	144	” “
78203	78211	78151	78151	Wo	144	” she said with a big yawn . “
78220	78221	78222	78222	God	44	” “
78232	78233	78222	78222	God	44	” “
78237	78248	78222	78222	God	44	” she said , leaning into me for a kiss . “
78253	78487	78222	78222	God	44	” I promised . I hastily changed into a suit and darted over to the church we ’d been going to since I was little . My mom had been an avid churchgoer , even before she found out about the cancer . Of course , we had n’t known how bad it was until she was on her deathbed . But it made sense now why she had been so religious about the church service . She must have been scared with five children and a life - threatening illness . I arrived just in time to make the service . Jensen , Emery , Austin , Morgan , Sutton , Maverick , and little baby Jason were all seated in the front row , like a defending army . Even though my family was super fucked up and carried more baggage than an airplane in a year , we were always here . Lubbock was one of those towns where church service was mandatory , but we Wrights took it to an extreme . It was new for me though . I ’d been gone for a long time . I ’d only gone to church when I was home for the holidays . I definitely had n’t gone when I was in Tampa . So , remembering that this was a thing we always did tripped me up on Sundays . “
78490	78511	78222	78222	God	44	” I muttered as I sank into the seat Jensen had left for me at the end of the aisle . “
78516	78520	78521	78521	My	49	” he asked . “
78528	78562	78565	78565	Landon	533	” Jensen shot me a look that said he did n’t believe me . And he was right . Not that I ’d let him know that . Emery leaned forward and waved . “
78567	78568	78569	78569	Em	533	” “
78571	78814	78569	78569	Em	533	” Her eyes said enough to me without words . She asked , How ’s Heidi ? Doing okay . Good . I worry . I know . I ’m watching out for her . She nodded her head at Jensen . You going to talk to him ? I sighed and nodded . Yeah . Thank God . She breathed out in relief and sat back . Jensen shot me a questioning look , but the service started before he could say anything . My mind was filled with the conversation that I knew I needed to have with Jensen , and I could n’t seem to concentrate on what was being said . I also felt pretty shitty about leaving Heidi in my bed even if she was going to just sleep away the rest of the morning . Luckily , the service was over soon enough , and the congregation stood and began to mingle . Emery jumped up and hurried over to her sister , Kimber , who was holding her youngest daughter , Bethany , and trying to corral Lilyanne . Austin fingered his pocket for what I guessed was a flask and tried to leave , but Morgan was smacking his arm and silently arguing with him . I knew it would n’t do much good . Also , I should probably help , but I did n’t . Sutton was the one who came over . “
78824	78882	78883	78883	He	1306	” she said , thrusting Jason into my arms . I laughed and softly cradled the baby . He was completely passed out and had n’t made a peep all service . And holding him in my arms like this made my chest ache . A family was something I had wanted ever since my father died . “
78890	78895	78896	78896	He	1306	” I told her . “
78917	79060	78912	78912	he	1306	” I laughed , and she grinned . Sutton was the baby , only twenty - one years old , and , she ’d somehow had her own baby before everyone , except Jensen . It was almost unfair . But I could n’t begrudge her the happiness . She was still glowing with joy . We had all thought that Sutton ’s shotgun wedding was because of this little guy in my arms . Yet she seemed to genuinely love her husband , Maverick . Against all odds , Sutton was the happiest of us all and the one with the least amount of baggage . Maybe because she had only been one when our mom died and eleven when our dad died , she did n’t have as acute memories of the pain . Either way , I envied her . “
79069	79073	78912	78912	he	1306	” I asked . “
79084	79085	78912	78912	he	1306	” “
79088	79092	79093	79093	Jensen	533	” she groaned . “
79117	79118	79119	79119	I	49	” “
79129	79133	79119	79119	I	49	” Jensen said . “
79164	79170	79171	79171	You	49	” Her eyes lit up . “
79175	79176	79171	79171	You	49	” “
79190	79191	79192	79192	You	49	” “
79197	79216	79192	79192	You	49	” she said . Maverick appeared at the sound of her squeal , and she filled him in . “
79221	79284	79219	79219	man	49	” he said , holding his hand out to Jensen . Jensen shook it and gave him a curious look . I was sure Jensen still believed that Maverick only wanted Sutton for her money , but it sure did n’t look like it . Maverick took Jason from me , and I turned to face Jensen . He raised an eyebrow . “
79290	79294	79285	79285	You	49	” I nodded . “
79299	79300	79285	79285	You	49	” “
79303	79440	79441	79441	I	49	” We left the chapel together and wandered out into the brisk morning air . Lubbock had that strange sense of being desertlike . No matter how hot it got during the day , mornings and nights were always significantly cooler . Texas weather was strangely erratic . Being around Jensen always made me realize how much I missed him when I did n’t see him . No matter that we lived in the same town again and he worked only a couple of floors above me , I never saw him . He was a loner by choice , which had only intensified post - Vanessa . I was glad that he had someone even if that someone had to be Emery . But I could n’t talk ; I was dating her best friend . “
79448	79459	79446	79446	Miranda	84	” Jensen said as we headed out to his truck . “
79463	79478	79446	79446	Miranda	84	” I said . I had n’t even thought about Miranda since she left . “
79481	79482	79483	79483	I	49	” “
79489	79494	79487	79487	someone	277	” I told him . “
79497	79504	79487	79487	someone	277	” Jensen said with a sigh . “
79517	79518	79507	79507	You	1312	” “
79527	79528	79507	79507	You	1312	” “
79542	79543	79544	79544	I	49	” “
79564	79570	79573	79573	boy	185	” I carefully told him . “
79588	79589	79579	79579	Wright	41	” “
79598	79611	79579	79579	Wright	41	” Jensen sighed and looked up at the clear sky above us . “
79622	79623	79624	79624	You	1312	” “
79629	79637	79640	79640	Landon	533	” I told him with a laugh . “
79680	79681	79675	79675	I	49	” “
79692	79710	79689	79689	I	49	” I told him . I really was n’t sure what I ’d come to him for . “
79717	79723	79689	79689	I	49	” Jensen laughed at that . “
79743	79744	79745	79745	You	1312	” “
79755	79756	79750	79750	You	1312	” “
79789	79790	79793	79793	dick	133	” “
79801	79802	79803	79803	I	49	” “
79807	79808	79803	79803	I	49	” “
79816	79817	79803	79803	I	49	” “
79834	79835	79831	79832	your employees	1854	” “
79843	79844	79845	79845	I	49	” “
79859	79875	79857	79857	I	49	” Jensen asked me . I hesitated for a second and then shook my head . “
79878	79879	79880	79880	I	49	” “
79886	79896	79880	79880	I	49	” he said with a shake of his head , “
79957	80021	79948	79948	you	1325	” I opened my mouth to protest . I ’d known Heidi a hell of a lot longer . But he was right ; I did n’t need to tell him any details about who I was seeing . There was only one person on my floor who I ’d known before getting the job , and deduction skills were n’t that difficult . “
80036	80037	79948	79948	you	1325	” “
80044	80051	80052	80052	I	49	” I asked . He shrugged . “
80089	80095	80096	80096	I	49	” I gritted my teeth . “
80104	80105	80096	80096	I	49	” “
80116	80127	80106	80106	You	1325	” Jensen said , as if it were a crime . “
80165	80166	80167	80167	I	49	” “
80197	80203	80204	80204	I	49	” I asked in disbelief . “
80222	80229	80230	80230	You	1325	” Jensen held up his hands . “
80281	80286	80267	80267	I	49	” I swallowed hard . “
80289	81078	80267	80267	I	49	” Even though I knew that I would n’t . When I got home , I did n’t share my conversation with Heidi . I wanted to tell her that I was working on fixing the problem that kept us apart , but Jensen had made no promises . I did n’t want to get her hopes up , only for them to be dashed if he could n’t come up with a solution . The next morning , I went into physical therapy bright and early . Anjee greeted me with a friendly smile and started me on my warm - ups and stretches . Moving home to start physical therapy and getting a job with the company was supposed to help me de - stress , yet I was more stressed than ever . That meant my mental state was totally fucked up right now , destroying my whole reason for moving here in the first place . But Anjee always calmed me down , reminded me to keep my head in the game , and to heal right the first time so I could get back on my feet . I knew she was right . In more than one way . I needed time , and it was the only thing I could n’t actually rush . I finished therapy at exactly the right time , feeling worn out and achy all over . Monday mornings were the worst because I had taken the weekends off . But I was glad that I ’d gotten it out of the way . Then , I could play catch - up at work before everyone got there . I slumped over in my chair when I finally made it to my office . My back was throbbing . I had really worked hard today . Harder than I had before . Something Anjee had said made me really want to do everything I could every minute I was with her to get my back to start improving . And , now , I was hating myself for it . I popped a few Tylenol and then went through my emails . When I found the one that most interested me , I stopped and stared at the subject line . Lead Engineer Job Offer This was the job Heidi had applied for . I would know before she did whether or not she ’d gotten it . My mouse hovered over the email . I wanted to read it . I wanted to find out if she had gotten the spot . I wanted to be the one to tell her and congratulate her and hold her . But I could n’t do it . If she ’d gotten the job , then she needed to hear it from someone else . Even if no one else knew that we were seeing each other , I knew , and it would feel like favoritism . I forwarded the email over to Julia and Dennis , the head of engineering , and asked them to inform whoever had gotten the job . They probably thought I was being a dick by delegating out one of my tasks , but I did n’t care . Everyone thought that the Wright family were all dicks anyway . I did n’t mind feeding into our reputation a little bit if it saved my integrity . Twenty - Nine Landon Heidi appeared in the office an hour later . We tried not to talk to each other or look at each other when she was here . But I caught myself doing it anyway . No matter how troublesome it was , it was impossible to look away from her . Especially when all I could think about was getting her back to my place and stripping her out of all those sexy work clothes she strutted around here in . Though today , of course , I was excited to find out about the promotion . And I was glad that I did n’t know . If she had gotten it , I could n’t spoil it , and if she had n’t , I could n’t ruin her day . Julia rushed over to Heidi ’s desk as soon as she showed up , and they chattered away . I caught a glimpse of them together as I headed for the restroom . My stomach was actually cramping . I was so nervous for her . I knew what this meant to her . I knew all too well . When I stepped back out of the restroom though , I was shocked to find Heidi waiting for me . “
81083	81110	81111	81111	You	1330	” she cried , biting her lip and looking like all she wanted to do was throw her arms around me and make out with me . “
81115	81122	81111	81111	You	1330	” I said , playing dumb . “
81135	81162	81126	81126	You	1330	” Her eyes darted back and forth , as if waiting for someone else to come around the corner and find us talking to each other . “
81165	81185	81126	81126	You	1330	” I said . I wanted nothing more than to grab her around the middle and swing her around . “
81190	81196	81126	81126	You	1330	” she asked , beaming . “
81208	81214	81203	81203	you	1330	” I shook my head . “
81236	81237	81239	81239	my	49	” “
81256	81257	81258	81258	I	49	” “
81261	81271	81258	81258	I	49	” I said , taking a small step forward . “
81281	81282	81283	81283	You	1330	” “
81287	81320	81283	81283	You	1330	” But her eyes were bright , and her fingers curled into fists at her sides . I imagined them curling into my suit jacket , and I took another step forward . “
81324	81456	81457	81457	Landon	77	” God , I knew I was supposed to stay away . I knew that I should step back and not take advantage of this situation , but I wanted to . I wanted to run my hands through her long hair and knot it in my fist as I fucked her from behind . I wanted to kiss her perfect pink lips — both sets — until they were swollen . I wanted to taste every inch of her body and then let her taste herself on my lips . I wanted everything in that moment . And I could have nothing . She could see the desire written plainly on my face , and she released a breathy gasp that only made me want to re - create it . “
81459	81492	81457	81457	Landon	77	” she whispered . I tilted my head toward the empty restroom . She shook her head , eyes wide . I grinned as I dragged her inside and locked the door . “
81498	81510	81512	81512	you	77	” she panted as I pressed her back into the wall . “
81514	81581	81582	81582	Landon	533	” My lips crashed down onto hers , and she returned the kiss with fervor . As if we had n’t just been together last night . As if we had n’t been together all weekend . Yet I could n’t get enough . Patience flew out the window . Jensen ’s warnings flittered out of my mind . All my thoughts about integrity disappeared entirely . “
81588	81603	81582	81582	Landon	533	” she said as she grabbed on to my suit and tugged me closer . “
81607	81660	81582	81582	Landon	533	” My hand slid up her bare thigh and shoved her pencil skirt up to her waist . I thrust her thong aside , and she whimpered at my touch . My fingers delved in between her folds and felt her slick need . She was already wet for me . Fuck . “
81670	81762	81664	81664	I	49	” I told her . She closed her eyes and tried to control her breathing as my dick hardened uncomfortably in my suit pants . I moved my wet fingers to circle her clit . She tensed all around me as she tried not to whimper , and I knew it must be difficult because she was very vocal . But I kept circling her sensitive center until she was biting down on her own hand to keep from crying out . Then , I shoved two fingers up inside her . “
81765	81828	81664	81664	I	49	” I growled into her ear as she came on my fingers . I desperately wanted to take out my cock and have her against the wall . But we were out of time . I removed my hand from her underwear , and she sagged against the wall . Her breathing was erratic , but she hastily straightened out her skirt . “
81834	81835	81831	81831	I	49	” “
81840	81841	81842	81842	Landon	533	” “
81844	81852	81842	81842	Landon	533	” she said , smacking my arm . “
81859	81860	81855	81855	You	533	” “
81868	81894	81895	81895	I	49	” She was glaring at me now . She looked pissed as all hell even though I ’d just given her a hot fucking orgasm . “
81899	81903	81895	81895	I	49	” I admitted . “
81919	81923	81895	81895	I	49	” I grinned . “
81934	82072	81927	81927	I	49	” She shook her head and sent one more look pointed my way — half - desire and half - anger . Then , she peeked out of the restroom and disappeared . I took a minute to steady myself against the sink . I ’d been so close to fucking her right then and there on the restroom sink . And I had n’t given two fucks . Discretion was causing me physical pain . Fuck , Jensen and his stay away from her . With a sigh , I ran a hand back through my hair and eased back to my desk . I was finally getting through the rest of my emails for the morning when there was a knock at the door . I glanced up and saw Matt standing at the door . “
82077	82078	81927	81927	I	49	” “
82083	82091	82081	82081	Landon	533	” he said , entering the room . “
82100	82127	82098	82098	Matt	49	” Matt ’s face darkened , and he glanced away . Then , he firmly shut the door and took the seat in front of me . “
82140	82141	82098	82098	Matt	49	” “
82146	82147	82148	82148	I	49	” “
82172	82183	82161	82161	I	49	” I leaned back in my seat and assessed him . “
82187	82188	82189	82189	I	49	” “
82242	82243	82214	82214	I	49	” “
82246	82293	82214	82214	I	49	” I had a feeling I knew where this was going , and I was n’t going to like it . This Matt guy sure thought highly of himself . In my experience , the people with the best credentials did n’t have to flaunt them . “
82306	82314	82315	82315	Matt	49	” He crossed his arms and waited . “
82364	82365	82346	82346	She	1336	” “
82378	82394	82346	82346	She	1336	” I stood from my desk and buttoned the top button of my suit jacket . “
82419	82504	82346	82346	She	1336	” Matt looked disgusted with me and then turned and walked out . My day did n’t get any better . No less than three other men in the department came to talk to me about picking Heidi over them . From what I gathered , they did n’t believe that a woman could accurately do a man ’s job . When the last guy flat - out told me that , it took all my energy not to punch him in the teeth . “
82509	82519	82520	82520	Heidi	77	” I said , my voice short and irritated . “
82548	82779	82780	82780	I	49	” I spent the rest of the day in silence and solitude . I knew that I had been short with everyone because they were talking about Heidi . But I also felt the general attitude was reprehensible . Morgan could handle all of Wright Construction just as well , if not better , than Jensen . There was no reason to say otherwise about Heidi . Before I realized it , the time had flown by , and suddenly , I was well past the end of the day . I rubbed my tired eyes and stood from my desk . Today had been exhausting . As I was about to shut my computer down , one last email came through . Ryan Copeland . I laughed . I had n’t heard that name in a while . I opened the email from probably my best golfing friend and read the contents . You know you want to . I scrolled down and saw what he meant . I frowned and then contemplated . Hmm … maybe he ’s right . I pulled out my phone and shot Heidi a text message . Go away with me this weekend . A ding sounded from down the hallway , and I found Heidi herself walking toward me . She looked just as worn down from the day as I did . “
82789	82793	82780	82780	I	49	” I said . “
82804	82817	82780	82780	I	49	” She held up her phone as she wandered into my office . “
82823	82837	82780	82780	I	49	” The floor was eerily empty when I closed the door behind her . “
82844	82871	82872	82872	Landon	77	” She leaned backward against my desk . Her pencil skirt slid up her thighs , and I could n’t help my gaze from shifting there . “
82899	82900	82895	82895	you	1341	” “
82903	82925	82895	82895	you	1341	” I asked , stepping up to her . I was close enough to touch her , but I did n’t . “
82931	82932	82895	82895	you	1341	” “
82939	82940	82895	82895	you	1341	” “
82943	82948	82949	82949	Everyone	285	” she told me . “
82972	82973	82955	82955	I	49	” “
82976	82993	82994	82994	Landon	77	” I told her . Then , I brought my lips down on top of hers . “
83002	83016	82996	82996	I	49	” she groaned into my mouth . But she did n’t stop me . “
83022	83023	83024	83024	I	49	” “
83029	83042	83024	83024	I	49	” she said as she felt my dick press up against her . “
83050	83070	83071	83071	Landon	77	” My hands trailed down to her ass , and I greedily grabbed it . I loved her ass . “
83073	83074	83075	83075	I	49	” “
83082	83083	83086	83086	Landon	77	” “
83088	83089	83086	83086	Landon	77	” “
83093	83110	83086	83086	Landon	77	” I slowly eased her skirt up her legs once more , and she gasped slightly . “
83119	83120	83113	83113	I	49	” “
83123	83161	83162	83162	Landon	77	” I told her . I took her thong in my hand and tugged it down her legs . She stepped out of it , and I stuffed them in my pocket as I winked at her . “
83168	83179	83162	83162	Landon	77	” she said , her voice barely above a whisper . “
83200	83211	83193	83193	Heidi	77	” I said , pushing my hand between her legs , “
83229	83230	83262	83262	God	44	” “
83234	83248	83262	83262	God	44	” Her head dropped back as my fingers caressed her most sensitive spot . “
83254	83255	83258	83258	Landon	77	” “
83266	83413	83262	83262	God	44	” I flipped her around so that she was facing my desk and then bent her over at the waist . I unbuckled my pants and let them fall to my ass as I pulled my cock out of my boxer briefs . Heidi whimpered softly . I caressed her pert ass and then kicked her feet a little further apart . I wanted to take my time with her here , on my desk , like I ’d been fantasizing about since I took this job . But , even though everyone was gone for the day , that did n’t mean we were completely alone . I knew we had precious few minutes . The anticipation made me rock hard , and I slid my dick deep into her pussy . She was already soaking wet for me . I had no trouble whatsoever . “
83416	83429	83262	83262	God	44	” I grunted as I pulled out and slammed back into her . “
83436	83437	83262	83262	God	44	” “
83440	83444	83438	83438	You	49	so”—I rocked hard into her—“deep
83446	83570	83438	83438	You	49	” My hand smacked her ass , and she yelped softly at the touch . The noise went straight to my dick , and I knew that I was n’t going to hold out for long . Not with her making those noises , not with her ass in my hands , not with my dick buried deep inside her while she was bent over this way . I picked up my pace , and soon , we were coming together . I gritted my teeth as I finished and then pulled back . I hastily cleaned up after myself and tossed the tissue into the trash can . Heidi tugged her skirt back down and then collapsed into one of the chairs . “
83583	83587	83577	83577	I	49	” I grinned . “
83596	83602	83603	83603	You	1346	” She shook her head . “
83614	83615	83603	83603	You	1346	” “
83621	83634	83619	83619	me	49	” I said , bending down and capturing her lips once more . “
83640	83648	83649	83649	You	1346	” she asked , already giving in . “
83666	84033	83661	83661	me	49	” Thirty Heidi It was hard to stay mad at Landon for being so reckless at work . I knew that I should have tried harder , especially since I ’d gotten the promotion . But being with him was like living on a perpetual high . No matter the withdrawals I might have to suffer later , I wanted the next fix . So , I ’d agreed to go away with him . It had n’t actually even been a question . Mostly because , when he ’d told me where we were going , I ’d squealed with excitement . His world was golf — more specifically , the PGA Tour Championship in Atlanta that weekend . It was the finals for the golf world where the best of the best came to compete for the FedEx Cup and the coveted first place ten - million - dollar prize money . The Masters was still the be - all and end - all of golf as far as I was concerned , not that I knew that much about the sport , but the Tour Championship was an amazing opportunity . Landon ’s friend Ryan Copeland had sent over tickets for some big event that weekend . Landon could get in pretty much anywhere off of his name , but I was pretty sure Ryan ’s thoughtfulness had won him over . We arrived late Friday night after work . We could n’t risk being seen leaving work early together again . It was bad enough that Julia had suspected I was up to something when I told her again that I could n’t go shopping . Luckily , Emery was with Jensen in New York City this weekend to see Colton . So , it was pretty easy to get out of shopping . I ’d packed more than my fair share of clothes for this trip . Even though we were only going to be there for two days , I wanted to be sure that I was prepared . When Landon got a look at my outfit on Saturday morning , he grinned and pulled me back into the bedroom . “
84043	84048	83661	83661	me	49	” I laughed throatily . “
84062	84063	83661	83661	me	49	” “
84071	84072	83661	83661	me	49	” “
84092	84098	84085	84085	I	49	” He kissed my lips . “
84135	84136	84130	84130	I	49	” “
84153	84161	84130	84130	I	49	” He gave me a searching look . “
84168	84169	84130	84130	I	49	” “
84176	84181	84172	84172	you’re	1349	” I said softly . “
84191	84192	84182	84182	I	49	” “
84196	84197	84182	84182	I	49	” “
84204	84205	84200	84200	I	49	” “
84214	84220	84200	84200	I	49	” He tugged me closer . “
84226	84227	84228	84228	I	49	” “
84233	84234	84235	84235	You	49	” “
84239	84243	84235	84235	You	49	” He laughed . “
84258	84330	84247	84247	I	49	” A knock on the door startled us apart , and Landon waved away my anxiety . I was n’t completely comfortable with being here with him . Even though I knew no one and clearly no one here would know me , I could n’t relax . This was Landon ’s element , not mine . Landon opened the door and shook the hand of the guy at the door . “
84335	84336	84337	84339	Landon fucking Wright	77	” “
84341	84374	84337	84339	Landon fucking Wright	77	” the guy said , strutting into the hotel suite as if he owned the place . He was an exceptionally tall and handsome African American man with the most amazing smile . “
84385	84398	84337	84339	Landon fucking Wright	77	” His dark eyes shot to me , and his eyebrows rose . “
84404	84405	84337	84339	Landon fucking Wright	77	” “
84408	84431	84432	84432	I	49	” I said with a raised brow . He reached out and placed a kiss on my hand with a boyish grin . “
84446	84452	84453	84453	Heidi	77	” Landon rolled his eyes . “
84466	84467	84460	84460	He	148	” “
84484	84494	84495	84495	Us	1353	” I deftly pulled my hand out of his . “
84497	84507	84495	84495	Us	1353	” Ryan said , glancing between me and Landon . “
84539	84540	84541	84541	Heidi	77	” “
84547	84557	84558	84558	Heidi	77	” Landon said with a shake of his head . “
84572	84573	84565	84565	She	1356	” “
84578	84584	84565	84565	She	1356	” I asked in confusion . “
84589	84606	84565	84565	She	1356	” Ryan said with a grin , as if he did n’t find it that awful . “
84629	84684	84611	84611	Basically	149	” I opened and then closed my mouth . I had n’t really thought that much about what the girls who followed them around on Tour were like . Sure , everyone knew that Tiger Woods had fucked more people than the average porn star , but it just had n’t registered with me . “
84690	84695	84687	84687	I	49	” I finally said . “
84705	84709	84710	84710	Y’all	131	” Landon said . “
84721	84722	84723	84723	Girlfriend	270	” “
84727	84731	84725	84725	Girlfriend	270	” Ryan sighed . “
84748	84749	84741	84741	I	49	” “
84763	84764	84765	84765	Alas	151	” “
84767	84776	84765	84765	Alas	151	” Ryan said . He winked at me . “
84805	84834	84792	84792	we	1361	” We followed Ryan out of the hotel and met his caddy , Gerald , waiting in the front seat . I slid into the backseat with Landon . “
84840	84841	84842	84843	Jake Gibson	153	” “
84845	84850	84842	84843	Jake Gibson	153	” Landon told me . “
84871	84872	84873	84873	Jake	153	” “
84881	84889	84879	84879	Wright	77	” Ryan said from the front seat . “
84898	85115	84890	84890	He	153	” Landon did n’t comment . I knew that he was thinking that he might never be back . Though he seemed fine when he was sitting behind a desk and pushing papers , I knew that he was not ready to swing a club … not even to walk a full course . The clubhouse was Southern and gorgeous . I could n’t get over the number of trees and hills and the overall humid nature of the late September tournament . Atlanta was about as different from Lubbock as anything could be . I was n’t sure that I liked that my hands were sweating just from walking outside , but it was undeniably stunning . People were everywhere . Thousands of people were already lined up on the course , being held back by a flimsy rope and held to silence for the players . Camera crews hovered around like early spring bees . As far as the eye could see , everyone was dressed in golf clothes . Ryan ushered us into the clubhouse , and we were brought to a huge room with a balcony overlooking one of the greens . Landon gently put his hand on the small of my back to get me to follow Ryan to the bar . “
85123	85133	85118	85120	so many people	1364	” I told him in surprise . He laughed . “
85164	85165	85171	85171	women	269	” “
85175	85176	85171	85171	women	269	” “
85215	85413	85414	85414	You	1374	” We were stopped four times on the way to the bar — all golfers who were excited to see Landon at the tournament and asking about when he ’d be back . He chatted merrily with all of them . Clearly , a lot of the golfers were close even though Landon had told me it was a pretty solitary life . The amount of time they got to see other golfers was pretty limited , and unless you were already out of the tournament , most guys liked to stay in the right frame of mind to play . I suspected that Landon had been that kind of player . He had that sort of intensity about him . Plus , he had taken a job so that he could keep his mind active . He took this seriously . I could see it in the respect everyone gave him . Being here , in this world , with him was a new and crazy experience . To me , Landon was still a Lubbock - area Wright brother with the Texas charm and easygoing personality . But here … he was so much more . “
85419	85440	85416	85417	a celebrity	1131	” I whispered in his ear when we caught up with Ryan again . Landon ’s eyes glittered with humor . “
85449	85450	85451	85451	I	49	” “
85492	85493	85482	85482	I	49	” “
85497	85498	85482	85482	I	49	” “
85510	85521	85482	85482	I	49	” Ryan asked with a big smile on his face . “
85540	85541	85527	85530	your high school sweetheart	1380	” “
85544	85609	85527	85530	your high school sweetheart	1380	” Landon said at once , his voice clipped . I frowned at that . He had told other people about Emery ? I was n’t jealous about that or anything , just surprised . I ’d figured he never talked about what had happened at all . That was what Emery and I had always assumed with the way he ’d moved on . “
85627	85628	85617	85617	I	49	” “
85631	85655	85617	85617	I	49	” Ryan passed Landon and me beers even though it was only eight o’clock in the morning and got a coffee for himself . “
85672	85768	85666	85666	I	49	” We moved over to the balcony and took a table from someone who had gotten up and left the clubhouse to go play . Our view was pretty stellar , and the guys talked shop in a way that was undecipherable to me . I knew as much about golf as Landon did about engineering . By the time Ryan had to go warm up , I was pleasantly buzzed from the beer and in need of a water . I was about to get up when a camera crew buzzed over to us . “
85796	85808	85785	85785	we	1382	” the man asked . I hopped out of my chair . “
85826	85827	85821	85821	I	49	” “
85833	85893	85821	85821	I	49	” I could see Landon did n’t really want to give the interview , but if he was half the celebrity he seemed to be , it was n’t going to be the only one he ’d give today when people realized he was here . The cameras started rolling as soon as I hopped up from my seat . “
85931	86022	86023	86024	Two waters	1387	” I watched as Landon layered on the charming charism . This was the guy I ’d fallen head over heels for . The one who I ’d held hands with while roller - skating and eating ice cream and snuggling in his bed . The one who I called my boss and fucker . I was his firecracker . And , somehow , that reality merged with this one . I disappeared then , letting him have his moment for the camera , and stepped up to the bar . “
86028	86029	86023	86024	Two waters	1387	” “
86033	86038	86023	86024	Two waters	1387	” the bartender said . “
86044	86073	86042	86042	Ben	95	” a familiar voice squeaked from the end of the bar . My eyes rounded in horror as I turned my head and found none other than Miranda . “
86080	86135	86136	86136	Miranda	84	” I breathed . She was seated on a barstool with a man who was one of the golfers that had stopped to talk to Landon earlier today . She was leaning into him and giving him a come - hither look . The term putt slut took on an all - new meaning . “
86152	86164	86146	86146	I	49	” She trailed a finger down his front and grinned devilishly . “
86185	86338	86339	86339	Miranda	84	” He put his hand on hers , as if to push her away , but he did n’t . She sidled up closer to him when he did nothing . And I ’d seen enough . I felt sick to my stomach . I snatched up the water bottles as soon as the bartender handed them to me , and I hurried away . I needed to get Landon out of here . As if it was n’t bad enough that Miranda had been refusing to sign the divorce paperwork , now , she was trying to find a replacement for Landon , so she could go from one golfer to another . I shuddered and moved to Landon ’s side . The interview had just concluded . He gave me a confused look when I appeared frantic . But then I said the magic words to get him to move , “
86343	86348	86339	86339	Miranda	84	” Thirty - One Landon “
86357	86404	86353	86353	she	84	” I asked as I herded Heidi out of the clubhouse . I probably should n’t be walking the course . Okay , I definitely should n’t be . But I could n’t stay in the clubhouse and run into Miranda . That would be suicide . “
86412	86416	86353	86353	she	84	” she asked . “
86419	86435	86436	86436	She	84	” We took the stairs and were outside when Heidi finally sighed and told me , “
86444	86445	86449	86449	me	49	” “
86451	86452	86449	86449	me	49	” “
86483	86491	86494	86494	she	84	” I gave her a disgusted face . “
86505	86509	86494	86494	she	84	” Heidi snorted . “
86521	86522	86513	86513	God	44	” “
86547	86548	86542	86542	You	1389	” “
86557	86576	86553	86553	I	49	” I laughed at her adorable face as I had her thinking about anal play and blow jobs . “
86585	86586	86589	86589	you	1389	” “
86591	86600	86589	86589	you	1389	” she said , playfully smacking my arm . “
86624	86625	86641	86641	you	1389	” “
86643	86670	86641	86641	you	1389	” I arched an eyebrow in her direction and wrapped an arm around her waist . Then , I dropped it lower and grabbed her ass . “
86676	86697	86641	86641	you	1389	” She leaned over and kissed me in a way that brooked no argument . She did not blame me . “
86701	86968	86641	86641	you	1389	” she whispered into my ear . Hell yes . Now that I was out of the clubhouse , away from Miranda , and out on the course , I felt more like myself . There were plenty of people mingling around who could recognize me , but with my hat pulled low over my eyes and without a club in my hands , most people just walked by . It was only the occasional wide - eyed PGA girl or devoted middle - aged man . Both were harmless in small quantities . Heidi took it all in stride . I was so used to this environment that I had n’t even thought to prepare her for what was to come . Of course , I was just the guy she ’d known in high school when we were in Lubbock . I was a different person out here , but I was enjoying her perception of it . Everything was a new adventure , and she wanted answers to all of her questions — how many tournaments I played , how much you could win , the dynamics of the game , who everyone was , what the importance of different clubs were , and on and on . I enjoyed telling her all about my first love — golf . The more time I spent with Heidi , the more I realized she was my second . By the time we returned to our hotel room later that day , we were both exhausted and starving , and Heidi was a little sunburned . “
86977	86981	86972	86972	I	49	” she groaned . “
86988	86989	86982	86982	You	1394	” “
86994	87007	87008	87008	I	49	” she asked , sticking her arm out for me to investigate . “
87021	87022	87023	87023	You	1394	” “
87043	87047	87048	87048	I	49	” She sighed . “
87068	87069	87048	87048	I	49	” “
87077	87081	87073	87073	we	1396	” I suggested . “
87100	87101	87093	87093	you	1397	” “
87166	87167	87168	87169	Golf groupies	1398	” “
87176	87180	87168	87169	Golf groupies	1398	” she asked . “
87223	87224	87241	87241	she	84	” “
87232	87238	87241	87241	she	84	” I sighed and nodded . “
87275	87276	87277	87277	She	84	” “
87288	87289	87277	87277	She	84	” “
87299	87300	87292	87292	She	84	” “
87318	87319	87312	87312	she	84	” “
87334	87339	87327	87327	I	49	” I told her . “
87375	87389	87390	87390	You	1394	” I kissed her forehead and then her nose and then her lips . “
87420	87425	87412	87412	I	49	” She laughed lightly . “
87430	87431	87432	87432	I	49	” “
87448	87449	87446	87446	you	1394	” “
87453	87460	87446	87446	you	1394	” she said with a nod . “
87468	87469	87463	87463	you	1394	” “
87484	87485	87480	87480	our	1409	” “
87490	87515	87480	87480	our	1409	” she said . All the tension left her shoulders . It was as if she had been afraid of seeing Miranda , too . “
87526	87607	87610	87610	Landon	77	” I tugged Heidi into the bathroom . The best part of the suite we had was the enormous stand - up shower with waterfall jets . We eased each other out of the clothes we had worn all day on the course and stepped into the steamy spray . My hands slid up and down her wet body and then up into her long hair . She released a soft moan when I ran my fingers across her scalp . “
87619	87623	87612	87612	We	1411	” she whispered . “
87631	87645	87624	87624	You	77	” My fingers slipped between her legs and tenderly worked on her clit . “
87654	87671	87624	87624	You	77	” she said with a laugh . Then , she dropped to her knees before me . “
87674	87776	87777	87777	Heidi	77	” I groaned . I ’d been thinking about all the fun we could have today , but fuck , I had n’t expected her to just drop like that . Then , my dick was in her mouth — hot and wet and fucking amazing . I lost all conscious thought at that point . Her tongue was lapping at my cock . Her hand worked it up and down . She even made this low humming sound that sent vibrations straight through my body . I shuddered as she bobbed up and down , fucking me with her mouth . “
87779	87790	87777	87777	Heidi	77	” I groaned , sinking my hand into her hair . “
87793	87794	87777	87777	Heidi	77	” “
87800	87801	87777	87777	Heidi	77	” “
87804	87859	87860	87860	Heidi	77	” was her response . I felt my dick twitch in her mouth . Fuck , she was goddamn good at that . I was barely holding on . If she kept at it , I was going to come in her mouth , and I really , really wanted to get inside her . “
87862	87866	87860	87860	Heidi	77	” I said , “
87874	87889	87860	87860	Heidi	77	” Her eyes popped up to mine , and she slowly released my dick . “
87893	87894	87860	87860	Heidi	77	” “
87902	88279	87860	87860	Heidi	77	” She could barely fight a grin as she turned around , put her hands on the bench in the shower , and showed me her ass . God , I loved everything about her , but she had an awesome ass . I moved my hands to her cheeks and spread them wide for me . Then , I palmed my cock and eased into her pussy . She moaned and pushed back against me , getting me just that much deeper . I wanted all of her . Every last inch . And so much more . There was not a part of me that she had n’t touched . And , whether she knew it or not , I was a goner . No matter the barriers between us , Heidi Martin had managed to eradicate them all from my mind . There was only her and here and now . And , when we were together , nothing else mattered . Just the feel of her and the taste of her . That smile . That touch . That moan . Everything about her . And she had no idea what she was doing to me . How completely and utterly she had stolen my heart . Our bodies rocked together in perfect sync . The hours at the course slipped away . She tightened around me . I slipped one finger between her cheeks and moved it against her pucker . When she clenched even harder , greedily pushing back against me , I eased a digit inside her . She cried out in pleasure at the feel of being filled , and my dick lengthened almost painfully as her body shook . We came together in the heat of the moment with the water beating down on us and the steam clouding the room . Heidi dropped to her knees , panting , as her orgasm took her over . And I stood , staring down at her in awe . She might have fallen to her knees , but I felt as if I had just given her a piece of me that I ’d never given away . I knelt beside her and brought her lips to mine . “
88284	88326	88327	88327	I	49	” I whispered into the embrace . She stilled and pulled back to look at me . Her eyes were wide with excitement and terror . As if she had wanted to say it all along but had been holding back . “
88333	88689	88690	88690	You	1413	” Thirty - Two Heidi We kissed passionately under the water and then cleaned ourselves up . Once out of the shower , we changed and found a local seafood place that had fish overnighted from the coast each day . It was incredible , and Landon assured me it was way more relaxing than a big PGA dinner could ever be . I wanted to go to one eventually , but it was n’t worth it to go to this one . Not when Miranda could show up and ruin everything . I did n’t want Landon to have to deal with that , and I could n’t handle the headache . It was enough for me this time that he really wanted me at the tournament to show me the life he led outside of Lubbock . And what a life it was . We spent the next day wandering the golf course and meeting his friends . Ryan fell pretty quickly out of the top of the tournament rankings , but Landon told me he would still be assured a substantial prize for getting this far . And the rest of the weekend was just … amazing . Hanging out with Ryan , enjoying the game , and finding my place in both of Landon ’s realities . After the winner was announced , we had to hurry and catch our flight home . I was sad to go . This had been a pretty wonderful weekend . Just the two of us actually having the opportunity to live our lives . It was refreshing . And it ’d made me all the more nervous to get home . Because we could n’t have that life at home . When we returned , he would be my boss again , and I would be a lead engineer in the company I ’d been working for since college … the company his family owned . Everything was stacked against us back in reality . And I did n’t want to have to deal with it . Not after the weekend we ’d had . “
88695	88705	88690	88690	You	1413	” he said as we boarded the plane home . “
88712	88713	88690	88690	You	1413	” “
88722	88723	88716	88716	you	1413	” “
88750	88751	88752	88752	Heidi	77	” “
88754	88761	88752	88752	Heidi	77	” he said with a sigh . “
88768	88769	88762	88762	We	1418	” “
88772	88776	88777	88777	I	49	” I asked . “
88786	88787	88777	88777	I	49	” “
88792	88814	88815	88815	I	49	” I screeched . A few people turned to look at us , and I dipped my head to my chest . “
88823	88824	88825	88825	I	49	” “
88855	88861	88862	88862	He	533	” My breathing got shallow . “
88870	88871	88862	88862	He	533	” “
88917	88918	88899	88899	he	533	” “
88933	88938	88929	88929	you	533	” I asked frantically . “
89001	89002	88995	88995	I	49	” “
89006	89007	89008	89008	Jensen	533	” “
89016	89017	89008	89008	Jensen	533	” “
89051	89052	89053	89053	I	49	” “
89081	89096	89069	89069	I	49	” Landon took my hand as we settled into our first - class seats . “
89109	89478	89102	89102	We	1424	” I nodded . He was right . If Jensen did n’t know , then it could theoretically be anyone . There were a ton of other women that Landon could be with , and if Emery kept her mouth shut , then Jensen would never have a reason to suspect me . In fact , he ’d probably think that I was the last person Landon would pick , considering his history with Emery . Landon planted a kiss on my cheek , and the rest of the flight was smooth sailing . My bad mood about having to hide our relationship again vanished . Maybe I was overreacting anyway . Did I want our relationship to be known to everyone ? Of course . Could I wait until Jensen moved Landon to a new spot ? Probably . I did n’t want to wait , but it was n’t the end of the world . Landon was worth waiting for as far as I was concerned . Our descent into Lubbock was a little rocky . They ’d had some storms unexpectedly blow through , and it was keeping a lot of flights in Dallas . Luckily , we ’d gotten out just in time . But my stomach was queasy by the time we made it to Landon ’s car . I sipped on a bottle of water as we drove through the flooded streets back to my apartment . That was such an issue in Lubbock . Because it rained so infrequently , anytime there was rain , all the streets would overflow . The ground could n’t soak it up . There were n’t enough drains . And , basically , the rain always hit like a flash flood . I swore , it was bad planning from some poor government civil engineer . A better sewer system would have handled that , but I did n’t work for the government . So , it probably would n’t get fixed anytime soon . Landon lugged my suitcase inside while I checked the mail . I tucked the mail under my arm as I dashed inside to try to get out of the rain . “
89491	89509	89102	89102	We	1424	” I said , throwing the mail onto the counter and shaking out my soaking wet hair . “
89527	89531	89515	89515	You	1425	” I laughed . “
89546	89547	89535	89535	I	49	” “
89552	89559	89549	89549	I	49	” he asked with a grin . “
89576	89577	89549	89549	I	49	” “
89581	89594	89595	89595	I	49	” He tried and failed to give me a look of innocence . “
89602	89686	89595	89595	I	49	” I traipsed into my bedroom and stripped out of my travel gear . I changed into pajama bottoms and a T - shirt before towel - drying my hair . I looked like a wet dog but whatever . When I walked back out to the living room , Landon was sitting on the couch , holding a plain white letter in his hand . He was gently tapping it against the coffee table . His eyes found mine across the room . “
89694	89702	89595	89595	I	49	” I asked , my voice small . “
89724	89725	89722	89722	you	1427	” “
89747	89763	89738	89738	I	49	” Landon stood to face me . The letter between us felt like a barrier . “
89819	89820	89813	89813	you	1427	” “
89823	89828	89829	89829	I	49	” I said fervently . “
89853	89854	89855	89855	You	1429	” “
89865	89866	89855	89855	You	1429	” “
89872	89876	89855	89855	You	1429	” I cried . “
89935	89936	89928	89928	He	49	” “
89988	89989	89961	89962	the kid	1431	” “
89996	90014	89961	89962	the kid	1431	” Landon said with a sigh . He walked forward to me and handed me the letter . “
90070	90195	90064	90064	you	1433	” I felt like I had been burned with a cigarette . I recoiled back from the statement as tears sprang to my eyes . Never in the six years that my dad was gone had I once thought about actually reading his letters , actually talking to him . But I ’d never thought about it like Landon had . If I could , would n’t I do everything to have one more day with my mom ? My dad might be horrible . He might have ruined my life and his own , but maybe I was in the wrong for not giving him a second chance . Landon ’s arms were around me as all these emotions hit me at once . “
90232	90233	90234	90234	I	49	” “
90242	90246	90234	90234	I	49	” I sniffled . “
90255	90289	90234	90234	I	49	” I pulled back and peered down at the letter . My heart constricted . I did n’t know if I had the strength today . I needed more time to contemplate it . “
90293	90297	90234	90234	I	49	” I whispered . “
90310	90311	90306	90306	I	49	” “
90314	90319	90306	90306	I	49	” he told me . “
90330	90582	90306	90306	I	49	” I leaned back into his embrace , my mind trapped on the box of letters hidden away in my closet . The thought of going them , of ripping open years of wounds , left me drained , and I had n’t even touched them yet . I was scared of what I would find — that , as right as I thought I was about my father , I might also be wrong . What if I had wasted six years for nothing ? And worse … what if everything I had done to shield my heart from him was for no good reason ? Landon left later that night when I got a text from Emery , saying that she was on her way home . He needed to get his stuff home and change out of his own travel clothes . Plus , he did n’t want to run into Jensen just yet . I knew that conversation was probably going to have to come up again , but neither of us wanted it to be like this . Emery showed up with Jensen , as expected . It made me happy for my friend and jealous that she did n’t have to hide anything . But , when she saw me sitting in the living room , watching Moana , she shooed him out of the apartment , and we spent the rest of the night catching up while she finished some last - minute grading . “
90594	90600	90601	90601	I	49	” Emery asked in shock . “
90620	90621	90622	90623	Lover girl	1436	” “
90651	90652	90655	90655	Landon	533	” “
90677	90678	90664	90664	I	49	” “
90687	90688	90681	90681	I	49	” “
90692	90704	90689	90689	I	49	” I said as I leaned over and kissed her cheek . “
90712	90713	90707	90707	Heidi	77	” “
90718	90722	90714	90714	You	77	” She giggled . “
90733	90734	90725	90725	I	49	” “
90737	90858	90861	90861	Heidi	77	” We looked at each other and then burst into laughter . It was a fun night . A chill night . One that I had n’t realized how much I needed . I had the best , best friend in the world . And I knew I was lucky to have known her my entire life . Our night ended too soon , and then it was back to the grind . I knew that Landon would be in early on Monday morning as usual , and I made sure to avoid his desk at all costs . I did n’t trust not to give myself away when I looked at him . I plopped down next to Matt . “
90863	90877	90880	90880	Matt	49	” he said with buoyancy I had n’t seen from him … ever . “
90882	90883	90880	90880	Matt	49	” “
90889	90899	90880	90880	Matt	49	” I froze momentarily , surprised by the question . “
90914	90915	90912	90912	you	49	” “
90920	90924	90925	90925	She	277	” he gushed . “
90934	90973	90925	90925	She	277	” I breathed a sigh of relief . He had n’t asked about my weekend because he actually cared . As per usual Matt . He had asked because he had news , and he wanted to share . “
90992	90993	90994	90994	I	49	” “
91026	91027	91021	91021	I	49	” “
91034	91058	91032	91032	Matt	49	” I said with a genuine smile . If he had a girlfriend , that would mean he might stop asking me out . “
91078	91111	91112	91112	Heidi	77	” I found that doubtful but told him how excited I was to meet her as well . I returned my gaze to my computer as Julia showed up at my desk . “
91118	91129	91132	91132	babe	77	” she asked , nodding her head toward her office . “
91138	91167	91132	91132	babe	77	” I followed her into her office and sank into the seat . Julia slowly closed the door behind her . She stayed facing the door and sighed . “
91178	91179	91132	91132	babe	77	” “
91182	91188	91132	91132	babe	77	” I asked in confusion . “
91198	91199	91196	91196	Heidi	77	” “
91206	91207	91196	91196	Heidi	77	” “
91229	91236	91223	91223	Emery	533	” She turned to face me . “
91245	91261	91238	91238	you	49	” I opened my mouth and then closed it . How did she know that ? “
91264	91268	91238	91238	you	49	” I nodded . “
91271	91272	91238	91238	you	49	” “
91280	91281	91238	91238	you	49	” “
91292	91362	91290	91290	Julia	84	” She did n’t answer my question . She slowly walked to her desk and pivoted the computer screen to face me . On the screen was a video of me and Landon out on the course in Atlanta . He had his hand on the small of my back , and you could clearly see me leaning in to kiss him . My hand flew to my mouth . “
91369	91370	91290	91290	Julia	84	” “
91392	91404	91385	91385	they	1442	” Her hands were shaking when her eyes finally met mine . “
91415	91671	91411	91411	You	1443	” Thirty - Three Heidi Shock hit me with the force of a tidal wave . I was knocked back , hurtling into oblivion , drowning in my own disbelief . I could n’t process the words that Julia had said . They did n’t make sense . They were n’t logical . They were n’t something anyone had ever said to me . A couple of days ago , I had been promoted , and now … this . I opened my mouth to ask the most obvious questions . What ? Why ? How ? But they did n’t come out . Nothing came out . Tears hit me in the backs of my eyes , and I fought with everything not to let them fall . I swallowed them , refusing to submit to such humiliation . I would n’t ask . I would n’t beg . I would n’t grovel . I certainly would n’t fucking cry . Not here . Julia was one of my closest friends . I knew this was killing her to have to be the one to tell me . But , as head of HR , this was part of her job . She ’d complained about firing other people before . It was her least favorite part of human resources . She thought it should be handled in each department , but everyone was always foisting responsibility off on someone else . And now … she was … she was … I stood abruptly . “
91674	91694	91695	91695	Heidi	77	” I managed to get out . It sounded hollow and brittle . More a gasp than a word . “
91697	91771	91695	91695	Heidi	77	” Julia said . There was anguish in her voice . Her eyes told me she wanted to reach out to me . Her body said that she wanted to comfort me . Her hands told me to stay … to figure out what was going on … to let her answer all the questions I had bubbling under the surface . But I bit my lip and took a frantic step backward . “
91774	91778	91695	91695	Heidi	77	” I repeated . “
91786	91787	91780	91780	you	77	” “
91790	92002	91780	91780	you	77	” I interrupted her . If I did n’t leave now , I would n’t be able to hold my head up high as I walked out of that office . And I needed that . I wanted to hold on to my pride until I was gone . I wrenched the door to her office open and stormed out of there like a thundercloud . As soon as I was out of her office , I went from near to tears to anger to pissed to wanting to fucking murder someone in about three seconds flat . My hands were clenched into fists at my sides . My heart was galloping at breakneck speed . My ears were ringing . I was seeing a tinge of red to everything . My head snapped into Landon ’s office . I was ready to blow a gasket , but I was unprepared for him not to be there . The office was dark , and the door was closed . I never looked in there anymore for fear of this . Exact . Fucking . Thing . And then , the day that I did , the day after we ’d gotten back from the PGA Tour Championship , he was missing . “
92005	92021	91780	91780	you	77	” I slapped onto his closed office door and then marched over to my desk . “
92027	92061	92062	92062	I	49	” Matt asked . He could clearly tell something was wrong . He looked confused and concerned . I just wanted to tell him to fuck off , but I held my tongue . “
92067	92118	92062	92062	I	49	” I told him instead of the truth . I scrambled to collect a bunch of my personal effects . I ’d worked here for six years . I could n’t get everything in one trip , but I wanted to make sure I had the things I really needed . “
92121	92134	92136	92136	I	49	” I slammed my hand down on the paperwork I was organizing . “
92146	92166	92136	92136	I	49	” He shrank back . I was usually a sarcastic bitch , but I did n’t raise my voice . “
92169	92170	92136	92136	I	49	” “
92177	92558	92136	92136	I	49	” I tossed everything I had managed to get together into my oversize boho bag , wiped any personal files and passwords I had off of the computer , and left everything else . I for sure thought Matt was going to try to say something else to me , but he did n’t . He just let me pass . He probably thought it was PMS or something equally sexist . That was the MO in the office . I left the office in a daze . I somehow made it out of the Wright Construction building , past the sign out front with the company motto , What ’s Wright Is Right , and to my car without being accosted by anyone . Tossing the contents of my purse into the passenger seat , I threw myself into the driver ’s side and just fucking sat there . My gaze drifted up the side of the building I ’d worked at for so long , and everything hit me at once . I had been fired . I would never work here again . I had no source of income . Everything I had worked for was for nothing . My life as I had known it was over . The tears that I had been holding back with shock and anger released like a torrent from my body . Suddenly , I was sobbing into my steering wheel , my hands on either side of it , as I uncontrollably heaved up and down . A choking sound came from my mouth , and I tried to suck in oxygen that could n’t seem to get to my brain . There was no oxygen . There was no air . There was nothing . I could n’t breathe . My body shook as the tears continued to stream down my face , and I turned into a blubbering mess . I started to cough loud and desperately . My chest ached , my fingers and toes felt numb , and my head felt fuzzy . I hiccuped over the tears , fighting my body ’s response to the horrible news . I was hyperventilating . I was having a panic attack . I needed to calm down . “
92561	92569	92136	92136	I	49	” I gasped out through the tears . “
92579	92931	92136	92136	I	49	” No matter how many times I told myself to stop what I was doing , it did n’t matter . Panic attacks were n’t rational . There was nothing that anyone could do to be logical about the situation . Calm was not a word that you even understood when it hit you . There was only that moment when your brain stopped functioning , you stopped breathing , and the tears refused to stop falling . It had been so long since I had an attack . Years , in fact . The last one had been the day when my dad was sent to prison . I had n’t cried in front of him . I had n’t said a damn word . He ’d pleaded with me . Begged for one more minute with me . A chance . I ’d coldly stared into his pale eyes that were so like mine and then turned and walked away . When I ’d gotten back to my car , I had n’t been able to leave the courtroom for nearly an hour . I could n’t do that today . I could n’t be here another minute . Despite the dangers , I revved the engine and peeled out of the parking lot . My breathing was erratic , and my tears refused to stop . My face was hot , and my eyes burned . Still , I did n’t stop . I did n’t pull over . I made it home without remembering a single thing I ’d done to get there . As soon as I was inside , I went straight to the shower , turned the water on as hot as it would go , stripped out of my work clothes , and stepped under the spray . The tears eventually subsided to a low keening and chest - rattling breaths . I moved into the living room and turned on some mindless TV , staring at it , unseeing . That was how Emery found me when she got home after school . “
92939	92954	92934	92934	You	1445	” I slowly turned to look at her and then back at the TV . “
92957	92958	92934	92934	You	1445	” “
92964	92993	92934	92934	You	1445	” she asked after seeing my splotchy red face and the clothes she had dubbed my Tinder breakup pajamas . Emery hurried to the couch and sat down . “
93013	93014	93015	93015	I	49	” “
93019	93032	93017	93017	I	49	” I coughed over the words , trying to get them out . “
93037	93044	93017	93017	I	49	” Emery whipped back , shocked . “
93049	93050	93017	93017	I	49	” “
93053	93059	93017	93017	I	49	” She gaped at me . “
93077	93078	93081	93082	my boss	51	” “
93084	93085	93081	93082	my boss	51	” “
93093	93097	93098	93098	I	49	” Emery insisted . “
93148	93149	93150	93150	They	1451	” “
93154	93155	93150	93150	They	1451	” “
93159	93173	93174	93174	Landon	533	” Emery squeaked . The tears came again when I thought about it . “
93201	93202	93194	93194	I	49	” “
93205	93219	93194	93194	I	49	” Emery tucked her legs up underneath herself and chewed on her finger . “
93224	93225	93194	93194	I	49	” “
93228	93251	93194	93194	I	49	” I bent forward , putting my head in my hands . Emery rubbed my back and held me as I cried . “
93258	93270	93271	93271	I	49	” she asked after a couple of minutes . I sniffled . “
93286	93287	93288	93288	Julia	84	” “
93290	93294	93295	93295	She	84	” Emery gasped . “
93299	93300	93301	93301	She	84	” “
93311	93312	93301	93301	She	84	” “
93341	93368	93332	93332	we	1454	” I went back to watching the TV and contemplating how horrible my life was at the present moment when Julia showed up in my apartment . “
93371	93376	93332	93332	we	1454	” she said tentatively . “
93381	93385	93387	93387	she	84	” Emery said . “
93389	93390	93387	93387	she	84	” “
93399	93403	93387	93387	she	84	” Julia deflated . “
93420	93458	93412	93412	I	49	” I dismissively waved my hand and then turned back to the TV . She was just doing her job . I could n’t blame her . I was busy blaming myself and Landon for this catastrophe . “
93468	93472	93412	93412	I	49	” Emery prodded . “
93479	93483	93412	93412	I	49	” Julia frowned . “
93518	93519	93509	93509	Heidi	77	” “
93535	93539	93531	93531	I	49	” I muttered . “
93555	93556	93547	93547	I	49	” “
93565	93621	93559	93559	Landon	77	” Emery asked . I frowned and glanced away . I had n’t asked about Landon . I had n’t even checked my phone to see if he had texted or called . My fury was building again , and I did n’t know if I could handle seeing him when I was like this . “
93627	93631	93632	93632	He	1457	” Julia said . “
93650	93651	93653	93653	he	1457	” “
93657	93661	93662	93662	I	49	” Emery asked . “
93679	93680	93681	93681	I	49	” “
93726	93727	93728	93728	Heidi	77	” “
93736	93742	93728	93728	Heidi	77	” I shook my head . “
93745	93746	93747	93747	He	1457	” “
93753	93754	93755	93755	I	49	” “
93759	93890	93755	93755	I	49	” I spat . Both girls stilled . They could feel my anger from where they were standing next to the couch . I could n’t seem to get it under control . If Landon and I had just waited , if we had listened to everyone else , if we had done the smart thing and stayed away from each other , I never would have been in this situation . Emery and Julia shared a meaningful look , but they did n’t say anything further about it . They just put on Mean Girls and brought me ice cream . We were only twenty minutes into the movie when my front door sounded like it was going to be broken down . My eyes shot to Emery ’s . “
93896	93904	93893	93893	you	1461	” She gave me an innocent look . “
93908	93909	93910	93910	I	49	” “
93914	93915	93916	93916	I	49	” “
93927	93989	93919	93919	I	49	” Emery nudged Julia , and they both headed to her room . Slow and creaky , I eased my body off the couch and wandered to the front door . I felt like I ’d aged a lifetime in the few hours since I left work . I turned the doorknob and found an irritated Landon standing at the entrance . “
93994	93998	93919	93919	I	49	” he asked . “
94005	94011	93919	93919	I	49	” He narrowed his eyes . “
94017	94018	94019	94019	I	49	” “
94029	94058	94059	94059	Emery	533	” I said as I walked away from the front door , leaving him room to follow me in . I heard the door click shut behind him . “
94066	94099	94059	94059	Emery	533	” he said . I winced , as if he had slapped me . Fired . That fucking word . Poisonous and toxic . One word able to do so much damage . “
94104	94105	94059	94059	Emery	533	” “
94115	94142	94059	94059	Emery	533	” His arm landed on my sleeve , and I jumped away from him . A look of horror flitted across his face and then disappeared . “
94149	94150	94145	94145	I	49	” “
94165	94166	94157	94157	We	1463	” “
94281	94282	94274	94274	You	1461	” “
94289	94295	94274	94274	You	1461	” he asked in disbelief . “
94306	94307	94274	94274	You	1461	” “
94327	94344	94308	94308	I	49	” I said with venom in my voice . My hands were trembling at my sides . “
94355	94356	94308	94308	I	49	” “
94363	94369	94359	94359	I	49	” I shouted at him . “
94393	94394	94395	94395	I	49	” “
94416	94417	94405	94405	I	49	” “
94443	94452	94453	94453	I	49	” I shook my head and looked away . “
94457	94458	94459	94459	Heidi	77	” “
94461	94474	94459	94459	Heidi	77	” he moaned . He ran a hand back through his hair . “
94495	94496	94490	94490	I	49	” “
94533	94539	94540	94540	I	49	” I threw at him . “
94552	94557	94540	94540	I	49	” he said stiffly . “
94574	94654	94655	94655	You	1469	” Landon recoiled at my words . I was hurting him on purpose . I knew I was . But I was so angry with me and him and the world . He was just an easy target . Because we could have stopped . He could have not pushed me the way he had , but he did n’t stop or back down . And , now , I was the one paying the price . Not him . “
94659	94664	94655	94655	You	1469	” I told him . “
94672	94673	94674	94674	I	49	” “
94679	94680	94681	94681	Heidi	77	” “
94690	94698	94683	94683	I	49	” I turned my back on him . “
94706	94785	94683	94683	I	49	” Tears welled in my eyes again . I heard him breathing deeply behind me . I knew that he did n’t want to go . And part of me wanted to turn around and beg him to stay . But I did n’t . And he left . Thirty - Four Landon I tried to put my hand through the brick wall outside of Heidi ’s apartment when I left . It did n’t go so well . “
94788	95120	95121	95121	Jensen	533	” I cried as I stomped over to the Mercedes . I shook my bleeding hand out before getting into the front seat , but it did n’t do much good . The knuckles were broken , and it hurt like a motherfucker . At least the pain kept me from thinking about the train wreck I had just walked into . When Emery had texted me and told me to come over , I ’d expected it to be bad . But I certainly had n’t thought it would be as bad as it was . I could n’t fucking believe that Heidi had been fired without anyone even talking to me . It was so unbelievably fucked up that I was beyond livid . I had known Heidi would be a pissed , but I had n’t prepared for her to take it out on me . I had n’t been prepared for it to be my fault . And I should have been . Because it was my fault . I ’d pushed and advocated for this . I wanted to be with her , and I did n’t care about anything else . Of course , I never wanted her to lose her job . Never in a million years . But we had n’t been careful . Hell , we ’d never been careful . It was fucking amazing that no one had caught us before now , considering all the shit we had done together . But I was n’t going to let Heidi walk away from us . We were meant for each other . Nothing was going to stand in my way . I drove over to Jensen ’s with a blind determination . I broke at least three traffic laws on the way , but I could really give zero fucks about it all . After pulling into the garage , I wandered into Jensen ’s house and called out for him , “
95123	95124	95121	95121	Jensen	533	” “
95128	95166	95121	95121	Jensen	533	” he called back . I found him sitting in his second - story office , staring at his computer screen . My hand was still on fire , but I slapped it down onto his desk . “
95174	95184	95185	95185	You	533	” I demanded . He glanced at my hand . “
95192	95193	95185	95185	You	533	” “
95206	95207	95208	95208	Landon	533	” “
95226	95227	95217	95217	I	49	” “
95234	95235	95230	95230	you	533	” “
95255	95256	95257	95257	I	49	” “
95260	95271	95257	95257	I	49	” Jensen sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose . “
95274	95283	95284	95284	I	49	” he repeated , pointing at the chair . “
95357	95363	95348	95348	you	533	” I snapped at him . “
95401	95409	95411	95411	you	533	” Jensen leaned back in his seat . “
95414	95415	95417	95417	I	49	” “
95429	95430	95424	95424	you	533	” “
95457	95458	95448	95448	I	49	” “
95467	95468	95464	95464	I	49	” “
95513	95514	95500	95500	I	49	” “
95542	95543	95544	95544	I	49	” “
95551	95570	95547	95547	you	533	” Jensen said calmly . He slowly got to his feet and put his hand on my shoulder . “
95583	95597	95598	95598	Heidi	77	” I smacked his hand away and ignored the pain from that movement . “
95622	95623	95616	95616	I	49	” “
95632	95641	95616	95616	I	49	” Jensen said , carefully choosing his words . “
95741	95742	95729	95729	Heidi	77	” “
95765	95776	95755	95755	I	49	” Jensen sighed and crossed his arms over his chest . “
95811	95817	95818	95818	I	49	” I shook my head . “
95827	95911	95818	95818	I	49	” Jensen moved back to his computer and pulled up the email that he had received with the evidence of Heidi and me together . It was a series of videos and a couple of pictures of Heidi and me on the golf course , in the clubhouse , and even at dinner at the seafood restaurant that we had picked at random . Whoever had taken these shots had clearly been following us because no one else had known where we were . “
95916	95926	95927	95927	I	49	” I groaned , finally sinking into the seat . “
95942	95951	95938	95938	she	1487	” I hated myself , but I nodded . “
95967	95968	95960	95960	I	49	” “
96041	96047	96048	96048	I	49	” I shook my head . “
96079	96088	96071	96071	He	1493	” Jensen drummed his fingers on the desk . “
96103	96104	96095	96095	he	1493	” “
96112	96113	96116	96116	you	49	” “
96118	96119	96121	96121	I	49	” “
96124	96151	96121	96121	I	49	” Jensen averted his gaze , and that was when I realized he had already come to a conclusion . He looked back at me then . “
96164	96180	96181	96181	Miranda	84	” I opened my mouth as the conclusion Jensen had come to dawned on me . “
96183	96184	96181	96181	Miranda	84	” “
96195	96196	96197	96197	She	84	” “
96203	96208	96197	96197	She	84	” I told him . “
96251	96252	96241	96241	We	1496	” “
96259	96267	96241	96241	We	1496	” Jensen said , touching his screen . “
96275	96276	96241	96241	We	1496	” “
96285	96286	96241	96241	We	1496	” “

96402	96408	96395	96395	I	49	” Jensen said with amusement . “
96416	96429	96410	96410	I	49	” I leaned my head back and stared at the white ceiling . “
96470	96471	96462	96462	she	84	” “

96593	96597	96591	96591	her	84	” I shrugged . “
96608	96609	96591	96591	her	84	” “
96620	96621	96610	96610	I	49	” “

96649	96655	96643	96643	You	49	” Jensen confidently told me . “
96665	96666	96669	96669	she	84	” “
96704	96714	96697	96697	She	84	” Jensen ran a hand back through his hair . “
96724	96730	96731	96731	You	49	” I narrowed my eyes . “
96736	96737	96738	96738	She	84	” “
96783	96784	96785	96785	I	49	” “
96789	96835	96785	96785	I	49	” I said with a nod . I ’d texted her half a dozen times after Emery messaged me , but she had n’t responded . She actually had n’t responded to my texts all day . I ’d been messaging her through my meetings . “
96841	96842	96785	96785	I	49	” “
96858	97029	96851	96851	You	49	” I nodded and disappeared into the guest bedroom . I ran my hand under cold water , hissing the whole time . It hurt something horrible . Dumb fucking idea . Yet it had seemed perfectly logical at the time . My stomach was in knots over everything that had happened . And the helplessness that had settled over me . Quitting had felt like the only logical thing to do . If I were n’t her boss , then she could have her job back . Yet it was n’t that simple . There were more things to consider than our relationship . Too bad I could n’t concentrate on any of them but the way that Heidi had looked at me when she told me to get out of her place . Once my hand was bandaged — another freaking injury for me to deal with — I moseyed back into Jensen ’s office . He was staring down at his phone , and he looked bleak . “
97032	97053	97054	97054	She	1508	” I asked . My stomach dropped , and I waited for the bad news that I knew was coming . “
97059	97063	97054	97054	She	1508	” I waited . “
97066	97067	97054	97054	She	1508	” “
97070	97071	97074	97074	Jensen	533	” “
97076	97080	97081	97081	She	1508	” He frowned . “
97085	97086	97089	97089	she	1508	” “
97092	97222	97089	97089	she	1508	” He shook his head . I snatched the phone from him and stared at the text from Heidi . I know you ’re only calling me because of Landon . So , just … don’t . I do n’t want to talk to him . I do n’t want to talk about him . I want nothing to do with him or any of his family . Leave me alone . My hands shook as the words filtered in and out of my vision . If it had been my phone , I probably would have thrown it against the wall and shattered it into a million fucking pieces . As it was , I tossed it to Jensen without care and left his office . He followed . “

97238	97239	97236	97236	Austin	41	” “

97301	97302	97281	97282	my girlfriend	51	” “
97305	97309	97310	97310	I	49	” Jensen muttered . “
97316	97317	97310	97310	I	49	” “
97320	97438	97310	97310	I	49	” I spat . I did n’t care one way or another who was there . Austin and Patrick were good for a distraction . And I needed one . Desperately . Because , otherwise , I was going to end up doing something really stupid . Tonight , I would be pissed . Tomorrow , I would put my life back together . Thirty - Five Heidi Two days later , I still had n’t moved from the couch . I was in the same clothes , and my hair was in the same topknot . Emery took one look at me when she got home from work and started to force me into the shower . “
97450	97451	97445	97445	You	49	” “
97465	97466	97467	97469	Heidi Anne Martin	51	” “
97538	97539	97540	97540	You	49	” “
97548	97549	97546	97546	Em	49	” “
97553	97561	97546	97546	Em	49	” She shoved me toward the shower . “
97566	97612	97546	97546	Em	49	” I complied . By the time that I was clean , had blown out my hair , and had chosen a new set of pajamas to lounge around in , Julia was here with her hand on her hip , looking fierce as fuck . “
97620	97658	97546	97546	Em	49	” I asked . Emery and Julia were both dressed in cute black - on - black outfits . And they looked ready to take me down if I resisted whatever plot they had come up with . “
97665	97669	97546	97546	Em	49	” Julia said . “
97689	97690	97691	97691	I	49	” “
97697	97698	97691	97691	I	49	” “
97707	97711	97691	97691	I	49	” Emery threatened . “
97737	97743	97757	97757	y’	1516	” I gritted my teeth . “
97749	97750	97757	97757	y’	1516	” “
97753	97754	97757	97757	y’	1516	” “
97763	97796	97757	97757	y’	1516	” I muttered . They were playing to my weakness . They knew I loved shopping . Even if I did n’t need anything . Though maybe some retail therapy would help . “
97799	97803	97757	97757	y’	1516	” Julia said . “
97808	98052	97757	97757	y’	1516	” I matched their morose attire and slipped into black skinnies , a black tank , and some old beat - up Converse . I skipped all my makeup , except mascara . Emery handed me her wallet , and I stuffed it in my purse . The weirdo still did n’t like to carry a purse . We took Julia ’s SUV to Malouf ’s , a local clothing store that was essentially the Nordstrom of Lubbock . It had all the fancy designers and did custom - tailored suits . Even though I should n’t spend money here , I loved to do it . A sigh escaped me as we entered because I realized there was no way I could afford anything in here now . With my job gone , I would have to use my savings to cover rent and my student loans . Normally , I was the one grabbing dresses off the racks and throwing them in my friends ’ unwilling arms , but today , I trailed behind . I might be able to suffer through window shopping , but I did n’t have to enjoy it . The thought of spending money at the moment made me panic . I knew I needed to be looking for another job . I just could n’t get myself to do much of anything . I was mourning the career I ’d always thought I would have . “
98056	98114	97757	97757	y’	1516	” Emery said , tossing the dress to me . I reached out and caught it before the silky material could fall to the ground . I looked at the dusty - rose satin slip dress that Emery had handed to me . It was stunning . My color and long enough for my build , too . “
98123	98139	98119	98119	I	49	” I held it up for both girls to examine . They wore matching grins . “
98151	98152	98119	98119	I	49	” “
98158	98162	98119	98119	I	49	” Emery encouraged . “
98171	98175	98163	98163	You	1517	” Julia said . “
98213	98214	98191	98191	Man	63	” “
98217	98226	98191	98191	Man	63	” Emery said , putting her hand out . “
98234	98270	98191	98191	Man	63	” I could n’t help it . I laughed . It was the first time since I ’d left work that I ’d done anything other than frown or cry . It felt … nice . “
98273	98277	98191	98191	Man	63	” Julia said . “
98284	98448	98278	98278	I	49	” Emery agreed . Then , they gathered me up and hurried me to the dressing room . Their arms were full of almost exclusively black apparel … and I had one dress . I was n’t sure if they thought I ’d bolt if we took too long to look or what . They seemed anxious to get me healthy . To see my smile and hope that I would turn back into the bubbly friend they were used to . I just … wasn’t sure I would be able to do that . Not yet at least . Still , I humored them . I slid the sleek material over my head and down my narrow hips . It cut low in the front and had a relatively high slit up the right side . When I stepped out of the dressing room , I was shocked to see the transformation . The girls were right . This was my color . “
98453	98457	98278	98278	I	49	” Emery muttered . “
98485	98549	98478	98478	You	49	” I laughed . Emery ’s sister , Kimber , had been prom queen in high school , and they were night and day in appearance . I looked more like Kimber than Emery ever had . In fact , in high school , it had felt more like the three of us were siblings , and I was n’t an only child . “
98556	98569	98550	98550	You	49	” Julia said as soon as she stepped out of the room . “
98587	98588	98578	98578	I	49	” “
98591	98606	98578	98578	I	49	” Emery said with a sigh , leaning against the three - way mirror . “
98625	98626	98615	98615	I	49	” “
98636	98637	98638	98638	Heidi	51	” “
98660	98666	98648	98648	I	49	” I shook my head . “
98675	98676	98673	98673	Em	533	” “
98685	98686	98682	98682	I	49	” “
98690	98695	98687	98688	My dad	266	” I choked out . “
98703	98704	98705	98705	He	266	” “
98709	98715	98705	98705	He	266	” Her mouth hung open . “
98721	98722	98705	98705	He	266	” “
98725	98729	98705	98705	He	266	” Julia asked . “
98735	98736	98737	98737	He	266	” “
98755	98760	98737	98737	He	266	” I spat angrily . “
98788	98789	98790	98790	Heidi	51	” “
98796	98800	98790	98790	Heidi	51	” Emery said . “
98808	98809	98804	98804	you	49	” “
98816	98823	98811	98811	I	49	” I said with a sigh . “
98833	98834	98829	98829	I	49	” “
98883	98884	98873	98873	We	1523	” “
98893	98902	98885	98885	I	49	” I said , holding up my hands . “
98949	98950	98951	98951	Em	1526	” “
98956	98957	98951	98951	Em	1526	” “
98967	98968	98951	98951	Em	1526	” “
98975	98976	98977	98977	I	49	” “
98980	98987	98977	98977	I	49	” Emery said with a frown . “
98990	98991	98977	98977	I	49	” “
99030	99031	99022	99023	Landon Wright	77	” “
99039	99043	99036	99036	their	1525	” Emery said . “
99062	99063	99064	99064	You	1528	” “
99069	99070	99064	99064	You	1528	” “
99086	99090	99091	99091	You	1528	” I gasped . “
99097	99170	99091	99091	You	1528	” I turned around and walked back into the dressing room . I did n’t want to have to deal with this shit . My body was shaking from the effort to not explode . I loved Emery to pieces , and I knew that she meant well . I had n’t wanted to yell at her . But she had been talking nonsense to me , and she fucking knew it . “
99185	99204	99091	99091	You	1528	” Emery said through the dressing room wall . I could hear the desperation seeping into her voice . “
99255	99274	99247	99247	Landon	533	” With my clothes back on , I hung the dress back on the hanger and stepped out . “
99277	99278	99279	99279	Heidi	77	” “
99281	99282	99279	99279	Heidi	77	” “
99348	99349	99356	99356	Heidi	77	” “
99365	99369	99356	99356	Heidi	77	” I snorted . “
99374	99375	99356	99356	Heidi	77	” “
99383	99387	99379	99379	I	49	” Julia asked . “
99431	99432	99420	99420	I	49	” “
99435	99447	99420	99420	I	49	” I said . I leaned my head back and sighed . “
99548	99549	99558	99558	We	1540	” “
99552	99557	99558	99558	We	1540	” Emery said slowly . “
99584	99585	99558	99558	We	1540	” “
99592	99596	99558	99558	We	1540	” Julia agreed . “
99657	99658	99653	99653	I	49	” “
99675	99682	99673	99673	Julia	84	” I said with a sigh . “
99696	99731	99688	99688	I	49	” Emery and Julia nodded . They could n’t ask for more than that . I was n’t prepared to give more than that . I held up the dress still in my hand . “
99745	99746	99688	99688	I	49	” “
99750	99757	99688	99688	I	49	” Julia said . I groaned . “
99778	99787	99772	99772	you	1545	” They glanced at each other and shrugged . “
99792	99796	99772	99772	you	1545	” Emery said . “
99806	99810	99801	99802	a girls	1002	” Julia said . “
99814	99815	99801	99802	a girls	1002	” “
99818	99819	99801	99802	a girls	1002	” “
99822	99826	99801	99802	a girls	1002	” Emery muttered . “
99832	99833	99801	99802	a girls	1002	” “
99836	99837	99838	99838	I	49	” “
99844	99852	99838	99838	I	49	” Julia said , ignoring my protests . “
99869	100523	100524	100524	Heidi	77	” That was n’t happening . But , in the end , I could n’t change their minds . And the dress came home with me . Still , my mind wandered back to Landon . Even though I did n’t want it , too . I wondered what he was doing . If he had been getting drunk with Austin every night , like Emery had said . If he had been moping around , like Julia had said . If he was hurting as much as I was . My heart ached with the loss of him . I ’d only just gotten him … only just fallen in love … and then it had all been tragically ripped away . I could n’t turn back the clock . We ’d known it was wrong , but it ’d felt so damn right . Now , it was all up in flames . Thirty - Six Landon Day four of no response from Heidi . Not even a text telling me to fuck off and leave her alone . I was going totally insane . The only thing keeping me from banging her door down was the reassurance from Emery and my family that Heidi needed time . Time . That sick fucker . It was turning into my least favorite word in existence . Something I had no control over . Something that constantly hounded me . Something that was impossible to run from or escape . An endless snake eternally eating its tail . Laughing at me . And how finite my life was . I brushed aside the thoughts that continued to plague me and sent Austin ’s third call to voice mail . I knew he wanted to go out and drink . We ’d done it every night since Heidi was unceremoniously fired and then dumped me . It had been a welcome reprieve from the ache that was so brutal , it was a fissure in my chest . But I needed a night away from it all . To be alone and decide my next move . Without even knowing exactly where I was going , I pulled into the cemetery parking lot and cut the engine . It was a clear night , and the moon hung heavy in the sky as I stepped out of the car , threw on a North Face jacket from the backseat , and wandered out among the gravestones . When my mom had died , I ’d only been seven , and cemeteries had creeped me out for a long time after that . But , when my dad had died , I ’d just stopped coming . I ’d told Heidi that I wanted to introduce her to my parents when we were official , but the truth was … I had n’t been out here more than a handful of times since they passed . And never alone . But I felt drawn here tonight . No more alcohol . No more wasted nights . No more forgetting . I found my parents buried next to each other in the middle of the cemetery . They had ostentatious headstones that could n’t be missed . The word Wright was in big letters on each of them . I sank into the grass between my mom and dad and just stared , unseeing . It was enough to be out there tonight and let my parents take the brunt of my pain . Headlights pulled me from my seat , and I hopped up to see a flashlight coming toward me . But the person never made it . They stopped a few rows short of me , and I was shocked when I realized I knew exactly who it was . Without a second thought , I walked right over and cleared my throat . “
100526	100549	100550	100550	Landon	77	” She whipped around and held the flashlight like a weapon . Her breathing was shaky , her eyes wide in terror . “
100552	100557	100550	100550	Landon	77	” she asked softly . “
100560	100561	100550	100550	Landon	77	” “
100568	100569	100572	100572	you	77	” “
100574	100585	100586	100586	You	77	” She shook her head and turned away from me . “
100594	100595	100586	100586	You	77	” “
100610	100611	100612	100612	Me	49	” “
100615	100616	100617	100617	Heidi	77	” “

100628	100632	100623	100623	Landon	77	” she muttered . “
100637	100638	100623	100623	Landon	77	” “
100641	100646	100647	100647	I	49	” I told her . “
100658	100666	100667	100667	I	49	” She blew out a heavy breath . “
100678	100679	100667	100667	I	49	” “
100682	100683	100684	100684	I	49	” “
100697	100698	100689	100689	Emery	533	” “
100719	100723	100724	100724	I	49	” She grimaced . “
100727	100728	100729	100729	Man	49	” “
100759	100760	100761	100761	I	49	” “
100764	100765	100766	100766	Emery	533	” “
100773	100784	100766	100766	Emery	533	” I arched an eyebrow . She shook her head . “
100790	100858	100766	100766	Emery	533	” I managed a quick smile at that . She ’d missed me . Fuck , just seeing her was eating me from the inside out . I wanted her back in my arms , in my bed , in my life . Sometimes , love cracked your heart open to show you what really mattered . Her . Only her . I held my hand out . “
100863	100864	100865	100865	Landon	533	” “
100867	100868	100865	100865	Landon	533	” “
100874	100915	100865	100865	Landon	533	” With a sigh , she placed her hand in mine and let me walk her over to my parents ’ gravestones . She dropped my hand when we got there and stared down at their names on the stones . “
100919	100923	100916	100917	Your parents	2205	” she whispered . “
100934	100945	100928	100928	I’ve	49	” I said , feeling totally out of my depth . “
100989	100990	100991	100991	Landon	77	” “
100993	100994	100991	100991	Landon	77	” “
101002	101011	101012	101012	You	1554	” I said , turning to face her . “
101042	101056	101057	101057	I	49	” She jerked her head to the side and took a deep breath . “
101061	101062	101063	101063	Heidi	77	” “
101074	101075	101076	101076	You	1554	” “
101085	101097	101098	101098	I	49	” she said . Her hands were clenched at her sides . “
101110	101114	101115	101115	Jensen	533	” I sighed . “
101170	101171	101159	101161	my bitch ex	1558	” “
101179	101180	101181	101181	I	49	” “
101203	101204	101189	101189	she	84	” “
101215	101220	101208	101208	she	84	” I laughed humorlessly . “
101277	101290	101291	101291	I	49	” I shook my head and glanced at my father ’s gravestone . “
101333	101334	101322	101322	I	49	” “
101346	101352	101322	101322	I	49	” She crossed her arms . “
101476	101477	101471	101471	I	49	” “
101486	101490	101471	101471	I	49	” Heidi gasped . “
101546	101547	101538	101538	we	1573	” “
101553	101557	101558	101558	I	49	” Heidi said . “
101594	101662	101589	101589	I	49	” She closed her eyes and turned her head to the stars . She was shaking slightly from the chill . Lubbock was so windy all the time that it would make nights cold . I slipped off the North Face I ’d put on earlier and slung it around her shoulders . She looked like she wanted to protest but was too cold to do so . “
101665	101679	101680	101680	I	49	” Her eyes dropped to the ground and then back up to mine . “
101691	101699	101700	101700	You	1575	” My jaw nearly hit the ground . “
101703	101704	101705	101705	I	49	” “
101745	101746	101747	101747	Heidi	77	” “
101752	101759	101747	101747	Heidi	77	” I said with a chuckle , “
101771	101785	101747	101747	Heidi	77	” I took a step toward her , and she took one back . “
101793	101794	101747	101747	Heidi	77	” “
101797	101811	101747	101747	Heidi	77	” I asked , my voice coming out harsher than I ’d intended . “
101817	101818	101747	101747	Heidi	77	” “
101826	101831	101747	101747	Heidi	77	” she told me . “
101870	101871	101857	101857	I	49	” “
101889	101893	101877	101877	I	49	” I asked . “
101967	101968	101952	101952	I	49	” “
102029	102035	102038	102038	me	49	” She gestured between us . “
102040	102041	102044	102044	you	1575	” “
102046	102050	102044	102044	you	1575	” she corrected . “
102121	102122	102117	102117	I	49	” “
102126	102174	102123	102123	I	49	” I said , suddenly miserable again . She loved me , but she did n’t want to even be near me . Miranda had hated my family for no reason , and now , Heidi hated them with good reason . I could n’t fucking win . “
102186	102195	102184	102184	Landon	77	” Hello , time , my old friend . “
102199	102205	102184	102184	Landon	77	” I found myself saying . “
102228	102270	102219	102219	I	49	” She took a stutter step forward , as if she wanted to throw herself into my arms . Then , she seemed to catch herself and stopped . She shrugged out of my jacket and offered it back to me . “
102274	102275	102276	102276	I	49	” “
102280	102281	102276	102276	I	49	” “
102304	102342	102343	102343	You	77	” I bridged the distance that she had been hesitant to cross before and tugged the jacket closer around her . Her eyes were round with concern at my nearness . But she did n’t pull away . “
102386	102398	102399	102399	I	49	” I leaned forward and pressed my lips to her forehead . “
102466	102483	102458	102458	I	49	” A tear slipped down her cheek , and I gently swiped it off her face . “
102490	102491	102492	102492	I	49	” “
102498	102536	102496	102496	Landon	127	” she said in a choked gasp . Then , she turned away from me and fled through the cemetery , leaving me with nothing but the dead to console my broken heart . Thirty - Seven Heidi “
102550	102570	102542	102542	I	49	” I said with a heavy sigh as Julia parked her SUV in the parking lot of the Overton . “
102576	102628	102629	102629	I	49	” Emery insisted from the passenger seat . I was seated in the back in the dusty - rose slip dress that Julia had gotten for me . I had no idea why in the hell I was wearing it or why I was about to attend the Wright Charity Benefit . “
102675	102681	102682	102682	Engineering	162	” Julia reminded me again . “
102690	102746	102682	102682	Engineering	162	” Well , that was true at least . No one in the department I had worked for had any interest in dressing up and going to some high - class function . But I did n’t understand why Landon would n’t be here . It was a Wright event . He was a Wright . “
102755	102768	102751	102751	Landon	77	” I asked . Julia and Emery passed a look between them . “
102775	102785	102771	102771	he	533	” Emery said at the same time Julia said , “
102792	102804	102805	102805	He	533	” They both laughed nervously , and I sat straight up . “
102816	102817	102814	102814	he	533	” “
102820	102827	102814	102814	he	533	” they both said at once . “
102838	102842	102830	102830	Jesus	51	” I groaned . “
102855	102856	102847	102847	I	49	” “
102867	102876	102847	102847	I	49	” Emery asked , swiveling to face me . “
102928	102929	102930	102930	You	51	” “
102936	102937	102930	102930	You	51	” “
102975	102996	102973	102973	Heidi	77	” Julia asked with a smile . Her red hair was flipped to one side , revealing the shaved undercut . “
103020	103035	103013	103013	I	49	” I popped the door open and stepped out with my nude strappy heels . “
103038	103093	103095	103095	we	1587	” Emery said . She hopped out next to me in her floor - length black dress and flats . Julia had gone with mile - high black heels . She was rocking it with a short black one - shoulder dress that showed off her tattoos . I would n’t fuck with her . “
103097	103305	103095	103095	we	1587	” Julia asked with a wicked grin . I nodded reluctantly and was ushered inside between my two best friends . I knew that they were only trying to be good friends , but I was not looking forward to this . Wright Construction had fired me , and I had broken up with a member of the Wright family . Now , I was showing up at one of their events . It was pretty ballsy . The ballroom was decorated to match the casino theme with enormous signs that said , Wright Charity Benefit Casino Night : Double Down for Charity . Roulette tables were set up in the center of the room . Blackjack and poker tables were already crowded with players . The noisiest area of the room was already the craps table . Women blew on the dice before men threw and hoped to win . It was outrageous and genius . All the money spent would be donated to the local Lubbock Children ’s Hospital . From the looks of it , it would be a very generous donation indeed . We angled toward the least crowded bar , and Emery passed out pink champagne . She held her glass aloft . “
103320	103321	103095	103095	we	1587	” “
103328	103336	103337	103337	I	49	” Julia added . I just laughed . “
103350	103351	103337	103337	I	49	” “
103358	103362	103352	103352	Y’all	131	” Emery spat . “
103370	103379	103380	103380	I	49	” Julia said , lifting her glass again . “
103386	103404	103405	103405	Bitches	164	” I said . Emery sighed , and we all clinked our glasses together . She muttered , “
103407	103467	103405	103405	Bitches	164	” under her breath as we tipped our drinks back . Julia ’s eyes lit up as we approached the craps table . I had only a vague idea of how to play . I had never been a big gambler , but I could see that Julia really knew what she was doing as she placed her bet . “
103472	103479	103405	103405	Bitches	164	” I asked . She grinned . “
103501	103580	103581	103581	You	1590	” I stared at the board with my head spinning . Yeah , less thinking . Sure . But then again , this was probably what people thought about pool , and it all fit for me like a puzzle . Julia had a crazy stack of money in front of her after only a half hour of playtime . She shrugged her shoulders , as if it did n’t mean anything , and then pocketed her earnings . “
103590	103597	103598	103598	You	1590	” Emery said with a laugh . “
103604	103605	103598	103598	You	1590	” “
103613	103625	103608	103608	I	49	” Julia said . Then , she frowned and looked uncomfortable . “
103634	103635	103636	103636	I	49	” “
103640	103644	103636	103636	I	49	” Emery said . “
103651	103694	103636	103636	I	49	” We moved over to the blackjack tables where Julia ’s eyes were lasered in on the cards popping up . If I did n’t know better , I would think she was actually counting the cards . Could she do that ? “
103703	103752	103636	103636	I	49	” someone said next to me . I whipped my head over and found Austin and Patrick standing and grinning at me . Patrick ’s date , Mindi , was drinking a dirty martini and staring blankly at the blackjack table in a silver micro - mini dress . “
103761	103769	103636	103636	I	49	” I admitted . Patrick smiled back . “
103775	103784	103636	103636	I	49	” But Austin ’s attention was on Julia . “
103787	103799	103636	103636	I	49	” he said . She glanced over at him with indifference . “
103805	103806	103636	103636	I	49	” “
103811	103812	103636	103636	I	49	” “
103815	103819	103636	103636	I	49	” she said . “
103832	103833	103636	103636	I	49	” “
103840	103857	103636	103636	I	49	” He tilted his head at the bar and grinned like the cocky bastard he was . “
103868	103869	103863	103863	We	1592	” “
103876	103924	103863	103863	We	1592	” she told him . Her hands were on her hips , and she looked fierce . I certainly would n’t want to mess with her . Emery pinched my arm , and I saw that she looked worried that Austin and Julia were making a scene . “
103931	103935	103936	103936	I	49	” I said . “
103949	103950	103936	103936	I	49	” “
103960	103964	103936	103936	I	49	” Julia said . “
103971	103972	103973	103973	I	49	” “
103984	103985	103973	103973	I	49	” “
103995	104001	103973	103973	I	49	” Julia ’s nostrils flared . “
104038	104039	104027	104027	You	49	” “
104046	104099	104101	104101	you	49	” he said , his jaw clenched . Julia slapped the shit out of Austin . His head whipped to the side , and the table we were near silenced . Everyone was staring in our direction now . But Julia did n’t seem to notice . She was shaking with anger . “
104103	104120	104101	104101	you	49	” she hissed . Austin rubbed his jaw , looked back at Julia , and laughed . “
104128	104227	104122	104122	you	49	” Julia fumed and looked ready to do more than just slap him when Emery intervened and guided Julia away from Austin . But I was staring at him . He was hurt . I was shocked to see anything but the look of a drunk idiot on his face . His tone had been reactionary . He ’d been offended , so he ’d gone for the jugular , and when that had n’t worked , he ’d made it a joke . It was a defense mechanism . I stepped forward and got in his face . “
104253	104254	104255	104255	Crystal	165	” “
104257	104398	104255	104255	Crystal	165	” he spat . I stormed after Julia , but she was holed up in the restroom and would n’t let Emery or me near her . I knew that feeling . She probably just needed to compose herself before she could go out there again . God , why did guys have to act like such dicks ? I was standing against the wall , sipping on another glass of champagne that a waiter had brought by , when I saw Landon break away from Austin and Patrick and aim straight toward me . It was like he had a radar to find me standing like a wallflower against the back of the room . Part of me wanted to turn tail and hide in the women ’s restroom , but I did n’t . I kept my dignity . “
104404	104414	104401	104401	you	1598	” he said with some surprise in his voice . “
104429	104440	104417	104417	I	49	” He deflated for a second before a quick recovery . “
104450	104480	104481	104481	You	1598	” He stared at me for a second too long , like he was drinking me in . I had completely forgotten about my sexy dress and high heels . “
104485	104490	104481	104481	You	1598	” he told me . “
104493	104579	104580	104580	You	1598	” I bit my lip as I assessed him for the first time . Because … holy shit ! He was in a tuxedo . A tailored tux that fit his body like a glove , and I wanted to slowly take it off . He was clean - shaven where he normally had a bit of scruff , and he must have gotten his hair cut . I really wished that he was n’t so hot . It would make all of this easier . “
104586	104590	104580	104580	You	1598	” He grinned . “
104600	104601	104595	104595	Patrick	632	” “
104613	104614	104604	104605	Your brother	1317	” “
104628	104629	104604	104605	Your brother	1317	” “
104649	104656	104657	104657	I	49	” Landon held his hands up . “
104687	104738	104677	104677	He	41	” What I wanted to say was , if he was n’t such a raging alcoholic , then maybe he would n’t always find himself in this situation . But I did n’t really know Austin . Definitely not like Landon did . So , I just let it go . “
104744	104769	104677	104677	He	41	” Landon trailed off and gestured to the room behind him . It was full of happy partygoers frivolously spending their money for charity . “
104778	104779	104677	104677	He	41	” “
104791	104835	104783	104783	I	49	” It was nearly impossible to stay aloof to Landon when he was staring down at me so earnestly , begging for a little time with me . Of course , this was what had gotten us into the mess to begin with . “
104851	104858	104844	104844	I	49	” I said with a sigh . “
104888	104889	104866	104867	your supervisor	1608	” “
104892	104893	104866	104867	your supervisor	1608	” “
104896	104897	104866	104867	your supervisor	1608	” “
104908	104914	104901	104901	I	49	” I asked in disbelief . “
104927	104928	104929	104929	They	285	” “
104983	104984	104976	104976	Jensen	533	” “
105017	105021	105015	105015	her	1611	” I spat . “
105040	105044	105032	105032	I	49	” he said . “
105059	105064	105065	105065	You	1611	” My eyes rounded . “
105068	105069	105065	105065	You	1611	” “
105095	105096	105084	105084	I	49	” “
105103	105111	105097	105097	I	49	” I said , my voice small . “
105170	105171	105163	105163	he	533	” “
105184	105185	105188	105188	you	1614	” “
105190	105194	105188	105188	you	1614	” he asked . “
105201	105202	105188	105188	you	1614	” “
105211	105212	105205	105205	Miranda	84	” “
105248	105340	105343	105343	she	84	” I had n’t thought that far ahead . I had been in my own bubble all week . Dejected and depressed over the loss of my job . I had n’t once thought about this like a pool game . Lining up the balls for three moves from now . Seeing where your opponent would move to get you in the right position . It was strategic . And , if Miranda was playing this game , then it absolutely was more than just getting me out of the way . “
105355	105359	105360	105360	She	84	” I whispered . “
105371	105375	105360	105360	She	84	” Landon nodded . “
105408	105417	105396	105396	I	49	” I glanced over his shoulder and froze . “
105427	105428	105418	105418	I	49	” “
105433	105545	105431	105431	you	1620	” Landon started . Then , he followed my gaze and found Miranda striding straight toward us . Thirty - Eight Landon Miranda ’s painted - on cherry - red dress drew eyes from all directions . And it was exactly what she wanted . So , I purposefully looked away from her and searched out Jensen and Morgan in the crowd . They were n’t hard to find , standing at the front of the room with a handful of big donors . As if she could sense me watching her , Morgan nudged Jensen , and he frowned in my direction when he realized Miranda was here . Showtime . “
105551	105571	105572	105572	Landon	166	” I told Heidi . I moved in front of her , so I was shielding her from Miranda . “
105612	105623	105600	105600	I	49	” Oh , Heidi . God , I love you . “
105660	105661	105652	105652	You	2076	” “
105665	105669	105670	105670	I	49	” she muttered . “
105676	105736	105739	105739	darling	2076	” I whispered before Miranda came face - to - face with me . Miranda stopped only a foot from me and smiled , as if she were truly excited to see me . As if the last time we had come face - to - face , I had n’t thrown money at her like a common whore . “
105741	105749	105739	105739	darling	2076	” Miranda said with a seductive smile . “
105755	105756	105739	105739	darling	2076	” “
105763	105788	105739	105739	darling	2076	” I said . Her eyes darted behind me to find Heidi standing there . I was sure she was glaring . Miranda huffed . “
105813	105821	105739	105739	darling	2076	” I gave her a pointed look . “
105826	105827	105830	105830	you	2076	” “
105839	105840	105830	105830	you	2076	” “
105848	105849	105853	105853	pet	2076	” “
105863	105870	105855	105855	I	49	” she said with a wink . “
105883	105891	105855	105855	I	49	” She batted her eyelashes at me . “
105895	105896	105855	105855	I	49	” “
105904	105905	105855	105855	I	49	” “
105926	105935	105921	105921	You	2076	” She cocked her head to the side . “
105942	105943	105921	105921	You	2076	” “
105953	105973	105921	105921	You	2076	” I asked . I had to clench my hands into fists to keep them from shaking in anger . “
105990	106037	105976	105976	you	2076	” Miranda told me . Heidi snorted behind me and then dissolved into laughter . That did nothing for Miranda . She went from Southern sweet to bitch mode in about two seconds . She sneered at Heidi , and I had to hold myself together . “
106048	106053	106046	106046	Miranda	166	” I told her . “
106105	106106	106107	106107	You	2076	” “
106118	106122	106107	106107	You	2076	” she snapped . “
106136	106137	106125	106125	I	49	” “
106144	106153	106138	106138	I	49	” I said as calmly as I could . “
106167	106245	106246	106246	You	2076	” There . I ’d laid it all out . Everyone in the building could hear what I had to say . It did n’t matter to me any longer . Miranda ’s threats were n’t valid . Whatever she wanted from me , she was never going to get . And I was tired of hiding my feelings for Heidi . She was the one for me , and I did n’t care who knew it . “
106251	106255	106246	106246	You	2076	” Miranda cried . “
106303	106304	106296	106296	God	44	” “
106309	106310	106296	106296	God	44	” “
106337	106338	106323	106323	You	2076	” “
106386	106392	106373	106373	You	2076	” Miranda rolled her eyes . “
106445	106475	106476	106476	Miranda	166	” She sneered at Heidi , and I felt her shift , as if to defend herself , but I shook my head . It was n’t worth it . “
106478	106482	106483	106483	I	49	” I warned . “
106490	106498	106486	106486	you	95	” Miranda said with a coquettish laugh . “
106520	106540	106486	106486	you	95	” Heidi lunged out from behind me . Really , after that comment , I did n’t blame her . “
106545	106549	106486	106486	you	95	” Heidi cried . “
106568	106569	106486	106486	you	95	” “
106595	106633	106634	106634	You	95	” Heidi ’s back straightened , and I saw more fire in her in that moment than I ’d seen all week . It was like my firecracker was back … and she was about to explode . “
106683	106693	106694	106694	I	49	” Heidi tilted her head and furrowed her brow . “
106699	106703	106694	106694	I	49	” Miranda laughed . “
106712	106713	106694	106694	I	49	” “
106747	106751	106736	106736	He	1636	” Heidi said . “
106777	106778	106779	106780	Fucking bitch	1637	” “
106782	106786	106779	106780	Fucking bitch	1637	” Miranda croaked . “
106796	106797	106798	106798	She	1637	” “
106801	106876	106798	106798	She	1637	” I said . I placed my arm around Heidi ’s shoulders and squared off against Miranda . Miranda opened her mouth to respond , but my family stepped up on either side of me and Heidi . We were all facing her — Jensen , Austin , Morgan , Sutton , and even Patrick , Emery , and Julia . Us against her . I knew who I would place my bet on . “
106881	106886	106877	106877	You	1638	” I said firmly . “
106893	106894	106900	106900	Wrights	68	” “
106911	106917	106902	106902	I	49	” Jensen shook his head . “
106933	106934	106924	106924	I	49	” “
106955	106977	106950	106950	I	49	” Morgan said . She changed her tone of voice and grinned at Miranda . I knew she was enjoying herself . “
106988	107002	106950	106950	I	49	” Miranda ’s eyes roamed between my family before landing back on me . “
107015	107041	107042	107042	You	1638	” My stomach dropped out of my body . My head felt dizzy , and I could n’t seem to process what she had said . “
107046	107047	107042	107042	You	1638	” “
107086	107162	107080	107080	I	49	” Miranda spat at me . The last year sped before my eyes . All the times I had defended her and catered to her and moved mountains for her comfort because of the miscarriage that I believed we were both mourning . Even when I ’d wanted out , I ’d been there for her through everything . Then she had done this without even telling me and lied about it for a year . “
107168	107177	107080	107080	I	49	” I said , pointing at the door . “
107181	107282	107080	107080	I	49	” Miranda opened her mouth to respond , but Jensen , Austin , and Patrick took over , acting as my own personal guards to escort her out of the building . I hoped this was the last time that I would ever see her . I ’d wanted out for a long time , but I ’d never fathomed the depths of her deceit . Heidi put her hand on my back . She knew what that meant to me . She knew how much I had wanted a family and what I had sacrificed to try for one . “
107291	107296	107297	107297	She	1641	” she said softly . “
107303	107304	107305	107305	I	49	” “
107308	107312	107305	107305	I	49	” she whispered . “
107321	107322	107323	107323	She	1641	” “
107328	107329	107330	107330	I	49	” “
107333	107351	107330	107330	I	49	” she repeated . Her hand ran circles around my back , trying to ease my pain . “
107366	107406	107364	107364	me	49	” I saw the sincerity in her eyes . That she was still upset with me but could n’t walk away from me when I ’d found out something like this . I loved her even more for it . “
107413	107414	107364	107364	me	49	” “
107464	107468	107454	107454	she	1641	” Heidi explained . “
107513	107514	107507	107507	She	1641	” “
107518	107522	107507	107507	She	1641	” I admitted . “
107528	107532	107534	107534	she	1641	” Heidi asked . “
107580	107659	107663	107664	a bitch	2099	” My eyes moved to Jensen , who was striding back toward us . He was proof enough that a divorce was bad when a child was involved . I nodded . I was glad . I did n’t want children with Miranda or to be shackled to her forever . But I would never forgive her for terminating the one we could have had . The possibility . It felt like losing the baby all over again . “
107666	107670	107671	107671	I	49	” Morgan said . “
107684	107685	107682	107682	Landon	127	” “
107690	107698	107699	107699	She	127	” I said with an eye roll . “
107724	107732	107737	107737	she	127	” She gave me a pointed look . “
107769	107779	107761	107761	You	1645	” I could n’t help it . I laughed . “
107795	107796	107761	107761	You	1645	” “
107799	107803	107804	107804	You	1645	” Heidi asked . “
107811	107812	107804	107804	You	1645	” “
107821	107825	107804	107804	You	1645	” Morgan said , “
107868	107960	107854	107854	I	49	” I took that first breath of relief at the thought . Even though Miranda had wrecked my life and slaughtered my heart with that last comment , it was going to be over soon . I could move on , and hopefully , I could do that with Heidi on my arm . Morgan winked at Heidi and then disappeared toward the small stage at the front of the room . I turned to face Heidi , who was still staring at me with round blue eyes full of concern . “
107974	107981	107854	107854	I	49	” I asked . She nodded . “
107990	107991	107984	107984	I	49	” “
108049	108055	108058	108058	I	49	” She waved me off . “
108134	108135	108136	108136	I	49	” “
108166	108203	108206	108206	gentlemen	1657	” I cupped her face in my hands and then gently pressed a kiss to her lips . She leaned into me , and I tasted sweet victory in that little movement . Heidi was mine . “
108215	108222	108204	108204	Ladies	1994	” Jensen said from the stage . “
108277	108294	108307	108308	Wright Construction	39	” The crowd laughed and cheered at his comment , raising glasses to toast the night . “
108361	108376	108385	108385	I	49	” My heart stopped beating . My jaw dropped open . Time itself stopped . “
108393	108549	108390	108391	Landon Wright	77	” Thirty - Nine Heidi Landon ’s shock oozed out of every pore . His family was grinning at him . They had all been in on it . Even Sutton , who was the only Wright not working for the company . And my heart went out to them all . They had seen his depression and the toll that losing golf had pressed on him . And then they had done something about it . I did n’t know how long this had been in the works , but I could n’t be happier for him . Landon went up onto the stage and shook hands with Jensen and Morgan . After they said a few words to each other , Landon turned on the charm as he thanked the crowd for this incredible opportunity and then said he hoped to see them all out there on the course . Emery nudged me . “
108554	108555	108557	108557	you	1668	” “
108560	108565	108566	108566	I	49	” I asked her . “
108610	108611	108612	108612	I	49	” “
108641	108642	108643	108643	You	1668	” “
108648	108652	108643	108643	You	1668	” Emery agreed . “
108661	108662	108656	108656	you	1668	” “
108671	108672	108673	108673	Jensen	533	” “
108703	108711	108698	108698	I	49	” Emery nodded her head behind me . “
108715	108730	108731	108731	Heidi	77	” I turned around and came face - to - face with Jensen Wright . “
108733	108741	108731	108731	Heidi	77	” he said with a dimpled smile . “
108744	108748	108731	108731	Heidi	77	” I said . “
108759	108760	108731	108731	Heidi	77	” “
108768	108769	108763	108763	I	49	” “
108781	108782	108783	108783	He	77	” “
108845	108846	108826	108826	I	49	” “
108852	108853	108826	108826	I	49	” “
108865	108869	108826	108826	I	49	” he continued . “
108881	108885	108872	108872	I	49	” He nodded . “
108960	108961	108944	108944	I	49	” “
108980	108981	108944	108944	I	49	” “
109023	109042	109012	109012	I	49	” I froze in place . My mouth popped open . My eyes were wide . He laughed . “
109048	109049	109050	109050	I	49	” “
109068	109073	109057	109057	I	49	” I admitted quickly , “
109117	109118	109119	109119	I	49	” “
109122	109129	109119	109119	I	49	” he said with a nod . “
109191	109192	109194	109194	I	49	” “
109201	109215	109194	109194	I	49	” I whispered , thinking this all sounded too good to be true . “
109223	109224	109194	109194	I	49	” “
109230	109237	109194	109194	I	49	” I asked with a laugh . “
109266	109276	109264	109264	Heidi	77	” My heart stuttered , and I felt faint . “
109279	109280	109264	109264	Heidi	77	” “
109283	109284	109264	109264	Heidi	77	” “
109287	109294	109264	109264	Heidi	77	” I said with a nod . “
109316	109321	109324	109324	man	49	” Jensen laughed boisterously . “
109333	109337	109329	109329	Landon	77	” I shrugged . “
109344	109362	109329	109329	Landon	77	” He nodded and extended his hand . I put mine in his , and we shook . “
109365	109366	109329	109329	Landon	77	” “
109371	109402	109368	109369	my God	1764	” I whispered . Then , I saw Landon striding toward us , and I could n’t help it . I dashed toward him , throwing myself into his arms . “
109407	109408	109368	109369	my God	1764	” “
109411	109423	109424	109424	Jensen	1314	” he asked , his voice half between concern and excitement . “
109432	109433	109434	109434	Heidi	77	” “
109440	109441	109434	109434	Heidi	77	” “
109449	109453	109434	109434	Heidi	77	” Landon laughed . “
109476	109477	109459	109459	Bask	168	” “
109482	109493	109480	109480	Landon	77	” I said . I pulled back and sighed heavily . “
109503	109510	109494	109494	I	49	” He held up his hand . “
109545	109546	109528	109528	I	49	” “
109628	109641	109616	109616	I	49	” He pulled me closer and planted a kiss on my lips . “
109665	109727	109660	109660	I	49	” I knew that now . The fog that I had been walking through all week cleared , and I could finally see what was in front of me . Landon Wright was the best damn thing that had happened to me . We might have had our ups and downs , but there were no longer any barriers between us . “
109737	109744	109745	109745	I	49	” I asked . He grinned . “
109751	109965	109966	109966	Heidi	77	” He held out his arm , and I placed my hand in the crook of his sleeve . Without a backward glance , we left behind our friends and family and the entire party . With the week we ’d had , I wanted to get away from the crowd and fall back in love with him . He had valeted the Mercedes , and we waited until the valet returned it to us . Then , he drove me across town . He did n’t even ask , Your place or mine ? He just drove to my apartment and helped me inside . I did n’t know how he knew that I wanted him to come to my place instead of his little tree house . But I wanted to erase the negative memories I had here with him . My hands slipped under his tuxedo jacket before I even got the door closed . He laughed at my eager behavior , but when I kissed him with everything I had in me , his humor evaporated . I wanted him and needed him like nothing else . I ’d felt warranted in my anger over the last week , but I wanted to forget that it had ever happened . “
109968	109975	109966	109966	Heidi	77	” he murmured against my mouth . “
109978	110023	110024	110024	I	49	” I groaned , tossing his jacket to the floor . His hands were clutching my slip dress . And it was the thinnest material possible , so he was actually digging into my skin . And , fuck me , I wanted him . “
110030	110031	110024	110024	I	49	” “
110039	110049	110024	110024	I	49	” He slipped his tongue across my bottom lip . “
110060	110061	110024	110024	I	49	” “
110069	110070	110024	110024	I	49	” “
110085	110109	110081	110081	you	77	” His fingers met the slit of my dress and eased up to my hips where I was without panties for the night . “
110112	110120	110081	110081	you	77	” I practically breathed against his lips . “
110124	110125	110081	110081	you	77	” “
110132	110161	110081	110081	you	77	” He moved his hand between my legs and stroked my pussy before exploring my clit . I purred at the touch , my body heightened with arousal . “
110165	110169	110171	110171	me	49	” I pleaded . “
110173	110174	110175	110175	You	77	” “
110187	110203	110175	110175	You	77	” he told me as he did a damn good job of owning my body . “
110208	110212	110175	110175	You	77	” I groaned . “
110219	110220	110215	110215	I	49	” “
110228	110229	110221	110221	I	49	” “
110251	110265	110266	110266	Your	77	” He shook his head . I leaned forward and tenderly kissed him . “
110299	110303	110305	110305	you	77	” He grinned . “
110311	110312	110305	110305	you	77	” “
110317	110589	110592	110592	Heidi	77	” He removed his hand and directed me to the bedroom . As I walked past him , he smacked my ass . Once I was in the bedroom , he took his time in pulling my dress over my head and discarding the expensive piece of material onto the floor . I could n’t seem to care . His hands traced their way down my body . Then , he leaned me backward on the bed and used his lips to follow where his hands had been . It was sweet , blissful torture . I wanted him inside me , and he wanted to devour me . He was winning . His tongue set siege to my clit , and his fingers ravaged the inside of me , bringing me to orgasm twice before he was satisfied . I was incoherent . There was no separation between me and Landon . There was no space or distance or emotion that we could n’t bridge . No feeling he had n’t captured . No touch he had n’t embraced . Living without him had been agony , and I refused to endure it again . I flipped Landon so that he was lying on his back and then moved on top of him . He gripped my hips and eased me down onto his dick . I tipped my head back with pleasure at the feel of him filling me . Then , I started to bounce up and down on top of him . My tits were moving with me , and I knew he was enjoying the view . “
110594	110598	110592	110592	Heidi	77	” he moaned . “
110607	110608	110592	110592	Heidi	77	” “
110613	110681	110592	110592	Heidi	77	” I pleaded . I could already feel my orgasm building again , and I was eager for him to finish me off . He wrapped his arms around my waist and held me tight against his chest . Then , he thrust up into me over and over again . His eyes were dark pools of lust , and I was a mirror for his desire . “
110688	110740	110741	110741	I	49	” he told me . And , when I came , I was looking directly into his orbs and screaming his name as I fell apart . He came with me , and we both lay , panting from exhaustion and satisfaction . He placed a light kiss on my shoulder . “
110748	110749	110741	110741	I	49	” “
110760	110799	110741	110741	I	49	” I told him with a wink before sashaying into the bathroom . When I came back out , he had his boxers back on and was lounging back on the bed , looking mighty pleased with himself . “
110806	110824	110741	110741	I	49	” I asked , slipping into a pair of panties and an oversize cheer T - shirt . “
110833	110834	110741	110741	I	49	” “
110841	110842	110741	110741	I	49	” “
110849	110949	110846	110846	I	49	” I laughed and snuggled up next to him in the bed . I pressed my face into his chest and breathed him in . This was real . All of this was real . Landon would be divorced in twenty - four hours . I had my job back . He was going to be working in golf again . The hardships had been insufferable … but they were worth it if I got all of this in the end . He ran his fingers through my long hair , and I felt myself being lulled to sleep . “
110953	110960	110846	110846	I	49	” he whispered into the stillness . “
110964	110965	110846	110846	I	49	” “
110973	110974	110846	110846	I	49	” “
110985	111035	111037	111037	you	77	” I felt so fortunate . Landon and I had fucked up . We ’d almost been destroyed . But we ’d come out ahead . It made me feel like I could do anything . And there were more things that I had left to do . Forty Heidi “
111049	111056	111037	111037	you	77	” I whispered . Landon froze . “
111060	111061	111037	111037	you	77	” “
111076	111088	111067	111067	I	49	” He leaned over and switched on the side table light . “
111094	111095	111096	111096	You	77	” “
111105	111106	111100	111100	You	77	” “
111113	111262	111107	111107	I	49	” I took a deep breath and then padded into the closet . I carried out the box of letters . It was pretty heavy . The last time I ’d counted , there were over three hundred unopened , unanswered letters in there . I was sure it was closer to three hundred fifty now . It was a daunting task but one that I felt I should finally dig into . My dad had made mistakes , like me and Landon , and I hoped that , by reading through the letters , I might actually discover the truth in all of what my father had done . Landon took the tub from me and placed it on the bed . We sorted through the letters that were mostly in order by when they had been sent , and I pulled out the very first one . “
111267	112156	112157	112157	Hank	118	” he asked . I nodded , feeding off his strength , and I tore the envelope open . I was surprised to find that it only had a few lines on it . My dearest Heidi , You deserve better than me for your old man . I hope , one day , you ’ll forgive me and come visit . I do n’t know that I ’ll survive this place without you . Love you , princess . Dad My heart stopped over every line . It was so little . So simple . Just an apology . Just his need for me to be with him , and I had n’t even been able to open it . We tore through letter after letter . The first fifty were all apologies , pleading with me to answer , to come see him , to understand . Asking for more than I had been able to give during that time of my life . I ’d been too upset with him … unable to forgive … never able to forget . Then , suddenly , the letters changed . The first one that was different started out with one last plea . Heidi , My desperation must not be clear enough to you , or you are refusing to respond to my letters . I can understand why you ’re upset , but I ca n’t say that I ’m happy that you wo n’t even talk to me . Even just to tell me to stop writing . I wo n’t ask again for you to come see me . When you want to come see me , I ’ll be here . Same place . Waiting . And then , of all things , he started talking about my mom . The first time he had seen her . The first time he had gotten up the nerve to talk to her . Their first date . Their first kiss . Their wedding day . The day I was born . The last six years of letters was a collection of every happy memory my father had ever had of me and my mom … and I ’d missed it . All of these memories that I did n’t have and events that I could n’t recall . Everything I ’d ever wanted to know about my mom and my dad , and they had been sitting in my closet , neglected for the past six years . There were enough letters of our history to fill a book . And Landon and I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning , reading every last one . I cried through a few of them . We smiled through most of my childhood . And my heart swelled to bursting with each new entry , like I was getting to see directly into my dad ’s head in a way he had never done for me when I was a kid … and certainly never after that when he was using . This was a different man . This was the man I remembered every year with ice cream and a good cry . He ’d been here all along . Sitting in prison , not more than five miles out of town . We finally reached the last one , and I slowly opened it , unsure of what story I would get to hear next . My eyes were drooping , yet I was still wide awake and anxious . My Heidi , I thought of another one that you probably do n’t remember . You were only three or four at the time . Tall for your age , of course . You ’re still tall . Just like your mama . Just like me . We thought you ’d be a volleyball player or even a basketball player . We had high hopes that you ’d want to be a professional athlete and get a scholarship to put you through school later . Of course , we could n’t afford much , so we were always hoping you ’d get to live your dream if you wanted . But you had different ideas . You wanted to be in gymnastics . It was the summer of the 1992 Olympics , and after watching the girls fly through the air , you decided that you wanted to do that , too . Your mama insisted that you go into lessons . I was working three jobs just to get by . I had n’t opened the bar yet , and we barely had enough to cover rent and keep food on the table . So , I told her no . Well , your mom had taken some gymnastics lessons when she was young . So , while I was working , she was teaching you how to do crazy backbends and other things I do n’t have names for . I came home one day to find both of you hanging upside down , and you had already figured out how to do some kind of walkover thing . It had only been a week , and your mom , she looked me right in the eye and said , “
112174	112334	112335	112335	Heidi	77	” I never asked how she got the money to cover it . I suspect she begged her parents . Something we both hated . But you got your lessons , and it was worth it in the end . Because that ’s how you got into cheerleading , and I have never seen you happier than when you are cheering . I did n’t understand it much . Did n’t even realize it was an actual sport until you were in it , but I was proud of you . I wanted you to have the world , and even when I could n’t always give it to you , I hope you know that I tried . I always tried . I love you so much . Dad I felt Landon ’s hot gaze on mine as I stared down at the last letter . Heat expanded in my chest , and then I burst out laughing . “
112337	112363	112335	112335	Heidi	77	” Landon asked . I could n’t stop it . I could n’t stop laughing . It came out of me completely unbidden and uncontrollable . “
112382	112405	112379	112379	you	1698	” I clutched my sides and leaned back on the bed as I let the emotions of the night wash over me . “
112408	112415	112379	112379	you	1698	” I managed to get out . “
112418	112419	112420	112420	I	49	” “
112433	112434	112425	112425	God	44	” “
112438	112439	112440	112440	I	49	” “
112470	112480	112468	112468	Landon	77	” I told him , biting back another laugh . “
112498	112499	112500	112500	I	49	” “
112518	112529	112507	112507	I	49	” he admitted . I leaned forward and kissed him . “
112599	112608	112609	112609	I	49	” He brought his lips to mine again . “
112619	112620	112609	112609	I	49	” “
112630	112644	112623	112623	you	49	” I said , moving my eyebrows up and down . He laughed . “
112655	112656	112623	112623	you	49	” “
112665	112666	112623	112623	you	49	” “
112671	112672	112623	112623	you	49	” “
112678	112696	112673	112673	You	49	” Landon carefully put all the letters back in the box and set it on the floor . “
112708	112737	112673	112673	You	49	” he asked as he climbed back on top of me . I fell backward on the bed and enjoyed the feel of his body pressing into me . “
112749	112761	112738	112738	I	49	” His eyes swept over my face , and he smiled . “
112764	112885	112738	112738	I	49	” Then , his mouth covered mine , and all talking ceased . The next morning , Landon and I presented our identification to the security guard at the gate outside of the prison where my father was housed . I was dressed in a simple blue sundress and a distressed jean jacket , and I was shaking like a leaf . I ’d been so confident when I planned this trip the day before , but now that I was here , I could n’t believe it was actually happening . After clearing our IDs , we were told where to go for visiting hours . Landon put his arm around my shoulders and steered me into the building . “
112890	112895	112896	112896	You	1705	” he told me . “
112901	112902	112896	112896	You	1705	” “
112921	112922	112923	112924	The man	2333	” “
112940	113097	112934	112934	He	2333	” I knew he was right , but still , I could n’t shake the fear from my veins . This could be a disaster . I took a deep breath and walked inside . Landon and I found a table at the back of the room , but I could n’t sit . I was too jittery . Nerves were fighting their way through my body , and I clenched and unclenched my hands . Landon stood by me and was my rock through the whole thing . Other visitors came in and waited , sitting casually at tables . This clearly was n’t their first time . A buzzer by the door announced that inmates were being let into the room , and I snapped to attention . My eyes were fixed on the door , as I waited for that moment . Anxiety crept through my body , and I shook my head . “
113103	113107	113099	113099	we	1707	” I whispered . “
113116	113124	113108	113108	We	1707	” He took my hand in his . “
113132	113373	113374	113374	Heidi	77	” I squeezed his hand . He was right . I was ready . I could do this . Then , my dad walked into the room . He looked as if he had aged significantly in the six years that he had been here . His hair had thinned and grayed . His skin was pale . His eyes were deep set . He carried himself as if he had a weight on his shoulders . And that weight was about to bury him . I gasped slightly at the sight of him . I might have noticed all of that at once , but what I saw next was just … Dad . My dad . The man I had sworn I would never see again . The man I ’d sworn I would never forgive . The man … who I was giving a second chance . His eyes scanned the room in confusion . I wondered if he had ever had a visitor in the six years he had been here . Then , he saw me . And the world stopped . His mouth opened , and tears welled in his eyes . A hand went to his chest . I thought he was going to collapse . I hurried forward with Landon on my heels . My dad stared in awe . His lips quivered , and then real tears fell down his cheeks . “
113376	113380	113374	113374	Heidi	77	” he whispered . “
113386	113387	113384	113384	you	77	” “
113397	113436	113437	113437	I	49	” He moved slowly and touched the sleeve of my jacket . When he discovered that I was real , he tugged me against him and held me . I wrapped my arms around him as he sobbed . “
113450	113451	113444	113444	I	49	” “
113455	113459	113452	113452	I	49	” I whispered . “
113475	113476	113468	113468	I	49	” “
113482	113502	113503	113503	Dad	266	” he said . He hesitantly released me and then seemed to realize that I had someone with me . “
113513	113547	113510	113511	Landon Wright	77	” My dad furrowed his brows , as if he were trying to reconcile Landon Wright being with his daughter . Then , he stuck his hand out , and Landon shook it . “
113556	113557	113554	113554	son	77	” “
113566	113567	113568	113568	You	77	” “
113575	113576	113577	113577	Dad	266	” “
113579	113600	113601	113601	She	1259	” I whispered . It had only been a few minutes , and already , he was interrogating my boyfriend . “
113623	113636	113611	113611	I	49	” My dad nodded , and they seemed to have an understanding . “
113642	113664	113611	113611	I	49	” Landon wrapped his arm back around my shoulders and kissed my forehead as my dad moved us to a table . “
113668	113672	113666	113666	you	1259	” I whispered . “
113697	113941	113942	113942	Congrats	1711	” As we turned to go and sit with my dad for the first time in six years , I knew that I would n’t forget that . Not ever . Because , when you found a love that was inescapable , you held on and never let go . Epilogue Landon Two Years Later I stared down the green in shock . I had just hit the last ball in my very first tournament back in the world I ’d thought I lost forever . And , even better , it was on the Wright Golf Club course . The course I had helped design and run for the last two years . It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life , and getting it added to the PGA docket for the upcoming year was an even sweeter victory . Not that I had come back with a bang or anything . I ’d ended this tournament in the middle of the pack . My recovery had been long and arduous , but it had happened . And my physical therapist , Anjee , continually reminded me that it would have been quicker if I had n’t been such a shit about pushing myself . My old friend and caddy , Jake Gibson , had come in for the tournament to play with me again . He picked up the ball I ’d hit and passed it to me . “
113954	113955	113942	113942	Congrats	1711	” “
113965	113966	113942	113942	Congrats	1711	” “
113976	113980	113942	113942	Congrats	1711	” I laughed . “
113988	113989	113942	113942	Congrats	1711	” “
114002	114003	114004	114004	You	49	” “
114007	114048	114004	114004	You	49	” I agreed . Then , I walked off the course and found my beautiful fiancée waiting for me . Heidi ’s face split as I approached , and she bounced up and down on the balls of her feet . “
114054	114077	114078	114078	I	49	” she cried , throwing her arms around me . I kissed the top of her head and tugged her in close . “
114085	114086	114078	114078	I	49	” “
114096	114097	114091	114091	You	49	” “
114103	114104	114091	114091	You	49	” “
114113	114130	114091	114091	You	49	” I looped my arm around her waist as we walked back up to the clubhouse . “
114137	114138	114139	114139	I	49	” “
114150	114151	114139	114139	I	49	” “
114157	114161	114139	114139	I	49	” I said . “
114175	114176	114139	114139	I	49	” “
114184	114185	114139	114139	I	49	” “
114193	114206	114207	114207	I	49	” She nodded her head in excitement and bounced around some more . “
114214	114215	114207	114207	I	49	” “
114221	114231	114216	114216	I	49	” I said , grabbing her for another kiss . “
114247	114248	114242	114242	we	1713	” “
114251	114252	114242	114242	we	1713	” “
114266	114267	114268	114269	Landon Wright	77	” “
114271	114279	114268	114269	Landon Wright	77	” she snapped . I just laughed . “
114283	114293	114268	114269	Landon Wright	77	” Then , she gave me a mysterious look . “
114298	114626	114268	114269	Landon Wright	77	” I grinned devilishly , and she smacked my arm as I passed . I loved her to pieces , and our sex life was unimaginable . I never thought that I could be this happy . After six months together , I ’d popped the question and asked her to move in and marry me , all in one fell swoop . She ’d turned me down . I should have seen it coming . Heidi was her own incredible woman , and she did things her own way . After a week , she ’d conceded that she had only said no on principle and that she wanted to be with me forever anyway . But , from there , we ’d been taking things slow , and we still had n’t set a date for the wedding . I was waiting for her to tell me when she was ready . If she was in no rush and she was in my arms and my bed every day , then I could wait for her . I thought a part of her was waiting to see if her dad would get out on parole to be there for the wedding . So , I did n’t push her . We ’d gotten rid of my tree house and her apartment , and we ’d bought a house by the golf course . Emery had moved in with Jensen the same weekend . Best friends and brothers . Who would have guessed ? Once I was changed , I found Heidi leaning back against the Jeep I ’d gotten after taking over my new position at Wright Golf Club . It ’d felt more permanent once I had my own car here . No more borrowing Jensen ’s Mercedes . She was in cutoff jean shorts and a cropped tank top with sandals , and I wanted to eat her right up . Damn surprise . “
114634	114652	114268	114269	Landon Wright	77	” I asked , swinging the keys around on my finger . She held her hand out . “
114657	114658	114659	114659	You	1715	” “
114666	114667	114659	114659	You	1715	” “
114671	114725	114726	114726	You	1715	” she countered . I laughed , knowing which buttons to push , and tossed her the keys . We piled into the Jeep , and she drove me to the north side of town . I could n’t figure out where we were headed until she actually pulled into the parking lot . “
114730	114739	114726	114726	You	1715	” I said with a look of disbelief . “
114745	114760	114761	114761	You	1715	” I stared up at the sign for miniature golf and burst out laughing . “
114766	114767	114761	114761	You	1715	” “
114774	114775	114761	114761	You	1715	” “
114778	114888	114889	114889	We	1717	” When we walked into the outdoor putt - putt course , I acted as surprised as I ’d promised I would be . My entire family was there , waiting for us . Jensen and Emery were bent over , talking to Colton . Austin and Patrick were trying to figure out how to juggle the golf balls . Morgan was shaking her head at the pair of them and talking animatedly to Julia . Sutton was chasing after a two - year - old Jason , who was toddling along ahead of her . Heidi cleared her throat , and they all turned to look at us . “
114893	114940	114941	114941	I	49	” Everyone cheered and congratulated me on my first tournament back , and it was truly amazing to have my wacky , damaged , incredible family all in one place . Then , as the excitement wore off , everyone moved to pick up their equipment . “
114945	114949	114950	114950	I	49	” Morgan called . “
114955	114977	114950	114950	I	49	” Patrick said in a pretty good imitation of Morgan ’s voice . She slapped him on the arm . Hard . “
114985	115004	115005	115005	I	49	” Jensen said , holding up a crappy putter . He shrugged , taking it with him anyway . “
115010	115050	115005	115005	I	49	” Colton yelled . Heidi and I moved up to the putt - putt station last . I claimed a mustard - yellow ball that no one else had wanted , and she grabbed a magenta - colored one . “
115063	115076	115055	115055	I	49	” I asked with a cocky grin . Heidi rolled her eyes . “
115089	115090	115080	115080	I	49	” “
115098	115099	115080	115080	I	49	” “
115110	115117	115105	115105	I	49	” I laughed and kissed her . “
115122	115123	115105	115105	I	49	” “
115130	115152	115105	115105	I	49	” When I lined up my first shot , Heidi leaned in behind me and kept trying to sneak in kisses . “
